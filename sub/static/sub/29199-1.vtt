I'm sorry, I love you so much.

I love you. I love you, too.

05:20.781 --> 05:22.783
It was just
an accident. It's all right.

We're OK, so...

What?

05:30.666 --> 05:31.667
What is it?

05:33.961 --> 05:36.922
The, the doctor said
I might lose a leg.

07:05.427 --> 07:07.930
It's nice... It's...
How are we going to afford this?

07:08.097 --> 07:09.223
A friend gave me the lead.

07:09.390 --> 07:11.934
It was a great deal, just
needed a little bit of work.

07:12.935 --> 07:13.978
It's great, right?

07:18.274 --> 07:20.109
The, uhh, neighbors were great.

I think it'd be
great for your gear.

08:01.233 --> 08:05.237
The kitchen is great. I mean,
I know it isn't the biggest, but

08:06.947 --> 08:07.990
it's nice, right?

08:08.908 --> 08:10.117
It's fantastic.

08:19.210 --> 08:21.921
I, uhh, I picked out some
furniture, actually, in here.

08:21.962 --> 08:23.464
I think it'll fit really nicely.

08:26.008 --> 08:27.343
It's spacious, right?

08:28.802 --> 08:29.803
Yeah.

-My bad.

09:32.533 --> 09:33.701
Let me give you a hand here.

09:33.742 --> 09:35.870
No, no, no. You don't
have to do that at all. I--

09:35.911 --> 09:38.497
Don't be silly. What are
neighbors for, after all? Huh?

09:39.957 --> 09:43.002
Oh. It's heavy. What
have you got in here, a body?

Yeah, Linda tells me you've got

10:25.002 --> 10:26.337
a perfect pad
on your settlement.

10:26.962 --> 10:28.881
If I may be so bold,
I am an investment broker

10:28.964 --> 10:31.467
and I can help with the money,
put your money to work for you.

10:32.384 --> 10:34.470
There's no guarantee,
mind you, but think about it.

Andy, you've met Ted?

10:40.142 --> 10:41.936
He was a really
big help with the house.

10:44.522 --> 10:46.023
Hey, I' about to
throw some steaks on.

10:46.106 --> 10:47.775
I could throw
a couple more if you want to

10:47.858 --> 10:48.984
-come over for dinner.
-Oh--

10:49.068 --> 10:50.069
Maybe some other time.

10:50.402 --> 10:52.029
But I... but thank you.
[chuckles]

10:53.989 --> 10:54.990
Ted!

10:55.199 --> 10:56.283
I need you!

Well, duty calls.

10:59.828 --> 11:00.829
Bye, Ted.

11:03.165 --> 11:04.166
Bring it.

11:08.879 --> 11:11.340
Hey, I couldn't
carry the box, but

11:12.466 --> 11:13.759

over a cake for us.

go a day without my tea.

Linda tells me you're
getting all settled in.

13:47.997 --> 13:49.540
Uhh, should be
back to work soon.

13:50.791 --> 13:51.959
Now what is it you do again?

13:52.751 --> 13:54.628
Andy's a freelance videographer.

13:55.045 --> 13:56.338
Freelance? OK.

13:57.339 --> 13:58.757
Linda, you're
into marketing, right?

[splutters]

14:01.051 --> 14:03.053
You could say that, I suppose.

14:03.345 --> 14:05.723
I'm part of
Senator Donahue's PR team.

14:06.307 --> 14:08.809
Uhh, OK. So, marketing, OK.
[chuckles]

14:09.768 --> 14:11.187
That's actually how we met.

14:11.770 --> 14:13.147
We were looking
for someone to film

14:13.230 --> 14:14.565
one of our tours, a sort of

14:14.773 --> 14:16.233
behind-the-scenes kind of film?

14:19.028 --> 14:20.154
I needed the job, though.

14:24.158 --> 14:25.701
I'm gonna let you
two get back to work.

14:26.660 --> 14:27.661
Thanks, Ted.

14:28.579 --> 14:29.622
Uhh, actually...

14:30.080 --> 14:31.540
I'm cooking a big meal tonight.

14:31.624 --> 14:33.375
Andy's dad is
going to be coming over.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.669
Would you and
Sabine like to join us?

14:37.338 --> 14:38.339
Are you sure?

[door opens]

14:45.387 --> 14:46.388

14:46.472 --> 14:48.098

14:48.557 --> 14:50.559
Hey, so where's the gimp?

14:50.893 --> 14:52.353
Andy's still getting ready.

14:52.811 --> 14:54.104
Sorry about your boss.

14:54.522 --> 14:56.273
Should have known
he'd get busted someday.

14:56.357 --> 14:57.358
[door closes]

14:57.566 --> 14:58.609
Don't believe the rumors.

14:58.692 --> 15:00.277
The senator didn't
cheat on his wife.

15:01.862 --> 15:03.989
Oh. I think I hear Andy...

15:04.198 --> 15:05.950
-He might need some help...
-Yeah, go ahead.

15:06.075 --> 15:08.160
-Go ahead I'll let this breathe.
-Thanks. Thank you.

Do you need help?

No. No, I'm...
I'm just cramping.

-Oh, do you need your pills?

15:34.645 --> 15:37.731
[music continues]

15:43.362 --> 15:45.447
Sabine will be here
shortly. She got tied up.

15:45.614 --> 15:46.615
A heavy workload.

15:47.032 --> 15:48.033
Hmm.

15:48.117 --> 15:49.326
She's a therapist, right?

15:49.910 --> 15:50.911
Uhuh.

15:52.288 --> 15:53.831
So how do you like the place?

15:53.914 --> 15:55.332
Linda here got it for a steal.

15:55.666 --> 15:56.709
It's fantastic.

15:58.627 --> 16:00.004
Been a whole lot of work, yeah.

16:00.796 --> 16:02.548
Even Ted here
lent a hand, uhh...

16:03.007 --> 16:05.718
Where I killed-- Manuel did.
[all laugh]

16:06.427 --> 16:07.970
I swear if it wasn't for him

16:08.053 --> 16:09.638
I still would
be only half-finished

16:09.680 --> 16:11.098
with my home
improvement projects.

16:12.892 --> 16:15.186
[doorbell]
Well, that must be her.

16:20.149 --> 16:21.150
[door opens]

16:22.568 --> 16:23.944
It is so nice to see you again

16:24.403 --> 16:26.447
when not covered
in the dust of renovations.

16:28.574 --> 16:30.159
-Nice to meet you.
-Oh, what am I doing?

16:30.451 --> 16:31.660
We are neighbors.

16:32.328 --> 16:33.329
[exhales]

16:35.539 --> 16:37.124
It is so nice
to finally meet you.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.167
Likewise.

16:38.417 --> 16:41.170
You two...
you make a stunning couple.

16:43.088 --> 16:44.423
I'm sorry to be so late.

16:45.382 --> 16:46.759
I do hope this makes up for it.

16:47.635 --> 16:49.553
Uhh, you really
didn't have to do that.

16:49.637 --> 16:50.638
I must.

16:50.763 --> 16:52.640
It's a single malt,
from Ted's own collection.

16:53.432 --> 16:54.433
He has a

16:54.642 --> 16:55.684
large collection.

16:56.685 --> 16:58.145
Well, everyone's
in the dining room.

17:02.650 --> 17:03.651
[door closes]

17:05.027 --> 17:07.571
So, how long have
you guys known Linda?

17:08.239 --> 17:09.323
We've just met.

17:12.243 --> 17:14.203
Oh. When we
were doing renovations

17:14.245 --> 17:16.830
I was under the impression
that you knew each other.

17:17.414 --> 17:18.415
We met

17:18.457 --> 17:20.000
when the realtor
brought her around.

17:21.252 --> 17:23.671
I just knew this would be the
perfect place for a new couple.

17:26.090 --> 17:27.716
[glasses tapping]
I can toast to that.

17:29.093 --> 17:32.137
So, Ted. How's the
world of investment banking?

17:32.346 --> 17:33.347
Well...

17:33.848 --> 17:35.599
it fluctuates, and
sometimes you make money

17:35.683 --> 17:36.851
sometimes you lose money, but

17:37.101 --> 17:39.103
we prefer to make money.
[chuckles]

17:41.480 --> 17:44.859
[footsteps with crutches]

17:45.192 --> 17:46.610
You really lucked out, son.

17:47.778 --> 17:48.988
Yes, I did. Yeah.

17:50.531 --> 17:53.075
If Mom were here, she'd be
pestering you about grand-kids.

17:53.909 --> 17:55.119
Oh, give it some time, Dad.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.203
We just got married.

17:58.455 --> 18:00.207
Said her parents
died in a car crash?

18:01.458 --> 18:02.459
No.

18:03.127 --> 18:04.378
-What?
-Look.

18:04.545 --> 18:05.546
[glass on table]

18:05.713 --> 18:07.047
This is how you get all the time

18:07.423 --> 18:08.591
and I'm kind of sick of it.

18:08.883 --> 18:10.342
You know, we're married

18:10.551 --> 18:11.635
and I trust her.

18:11.802 --> 18:13.804
You don't have to go
around and investigating her.

18:14.305 --> 18:16.682
Why do you think I didn't tell
you about her ahead of time?

18:18.434 --> 18:20.186
-Never had any time--
-Stop.

18:21.729 --> 18:22.730
[sighs]

18:24.356 --> 18:25.357
I'm sorry.

18:26.650 --> 18:27.651
You know me.

18:28.110 --> 18:29.111
Come here.

18:29.862 --> 18:31.113
[slaps back]

18:32.740 --> 18:35.284
Linda, you outdid yourself.
There was a fantastic meal.

18:36.535 --> 18:38.370
Shit, if you didn't tell us

18:38.412 --> 18:40.581
you weren't much of a
cook, I'd think you were a pro.

18:40.664 --> 18:42.791
[chuckles]
Thank you.

18:44.752 --> 18:45.753
Thanks.

18:47.463 --> 18:49.381
Did you know your wife
could cook your ass off?

18:49.673 --> 18:50.674
Uhuh.

18:51.342 --> 18:52.510
So, Gabe.

18:53.135 --> 18:54.803
I never asked
what it is that you do.

18:55.638 --> 18:57.097
Sit on my ass, mostly.

18:58.057 --> 18:59.308
I'm a retired detective.

18:59.517 --> 19:00.518
Uhh...

19:00.601 --> 19:02.645
You know, real exciting, right?

19:03.312 --> 19:05.314
You must have some
colorful stories to tell.

19:06.732 --> 19:07.733
A few.

19:08.651 --> 19:09.985
And the wacko was living there

19:10.027 --> 19:11.737
in the house
with him the whole time.

19:11.820 --> 19:12.905
[all chuckle]

19:13.405 --> 19:14.406
A ghost.

19:17.076 --> 19:18.077
Ted.

19:18.577 --> 19:20.246
You have
amazing taste in liquor.

19:21.288 --> 19:22.289
Thank you, sir.

19:23.582 --> 19:25.000
Yeah, fantastic.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.544
It is one of his hobbies.

19:27.795 --> 19:29.338
And what are Linda's hobbies?

19:31.382 --> 19:33.133
Well, let's see, umm...

19:33.259 --> 19:34.260
[chuckles]

19:34.468 --> 19:35.803
These two love-birds

19:36.345 --> 19:39.223
have known each other,
what, four months, and, married.

19:39.515 --> 19:40.516
Dad.

19:41.433 --> 19:42.476
I'm not judging.

19:43.185 --> 19:44.186
What? I...

19:44.478 --> 19:46.647
took a little time
with my first two wives...

19:47.606 --> 19:49.525
took a little
time with the third...

19:50.067 --> 19:51.652
Uhh, they all ended the same.

19:52.736 --> 19:54.280
I'm just, hoping that I...

19:54.697 --> 19:55.781
work out the fourth one.

19:56.490 --> 19:58.659
Sabine, you
have an older sister?

19:58.701 --> 20:00.077
[all chuckle]

20:02.830 --> 20:04.665
No, I just,
wish I would have known

20:04.957 --> 20:07.209
about the wedding
more than a day prior.

20:08.210 --> 20:09.253
So, Sabine, tell me

20:09.420 --> 20:10.796
how long
you and Ted been married?

20:11.755 --> 20:13.174
Five years, right?

20:13.549 --> 20:14.550
[chuckles]

20:14.717 --> 20:16.594
Men, such romantics.

20:17.344 --> 20:18.345
He is correct.

20:18.804 --> 20:20.222
It has been five years.

20:20.639 --> 20:22.975
And the happiest five
years of my life, I might add.

20:25.060 --> 20:26.854
If you want your
next relationship to work

20:27.479 --> 20:28.522
you have to find a woman

20:28.564 --> 20:30.107
who is at least
seven years younger.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.651
I find that puts
the man and the woman

20:32.693 --> 20:34.945
at about the same
emotional maturity level.

20:35.029 --> 20:37.031
Oh, I would agree.

20:38.365 --> 20:39.992
In my case,
we might have to shoot

20:40.075 --> 20:41.535
for a couple of decades.

20:42.620 --> 20:44.705
And on that bombshell
I must excuse myself.

20:46.415 --> 20:48.125
Night-night. I've got it.

20:54.965 --> 20:56.717
It's been a pleasure
seeing you again, Gabe.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.801
The pleasure's mine.

20:59.386 --> 21:00.387
Linda?

21:00.804 --> 21:02.765
When will we be
meeting your parents?

21:03.682 --> 21:06.060
Well, my parents
died when I was young.

21:06.143 --> 21:08.229
[soft tense music

21:08.270 --> 21:09.355
That's terrible.

21:11.190 --> 21:12.691
Yeah, I had a few foster parents

21:12.733 --> 21:14.985
but spent most
of my time in orphanages

21:15.069 --> 21:17.363
which is all right, actually.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.281
I, uhh...

21:19.532 --> 21:22.952
I was able to meet
some really interesting people.

21:23.619 --> 21:25.454
And now I have a father.

21:26.205 --> 21:27.790
And I'm proud to
have you as a daughter.

21:28.415 --> 21:29.792
[bumping sounds above]

21:30.918 --> 21:32.419
You will, please excuse me.

21:34.338 --> 21:37.341
[music continues]

21:39.885 --> 21:40.886
[door opens]

21:45.933 --> 21:46.976
Let me help you.

21:52.481 --> 21:54.149
Are you hurt? Come on.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.736
No, I'm...
[scuffling]

21:57.820 --> 21:58.863
not helpless!

22:02.032 --> 22:05.119
[grunting]

[music continues]

22:17.965 --> 22:19.175
[crutches tapping]

22:22.887 --> 22:23.888
Let's go.

22:28.976 --> 22:30.227
Kids, we're heading on out.

22:30.811 --> 22:32.605
Thank you for
a wonderful evening.

22:33.105 --> 22:34.648
You have a lovely home.

22:34.773 --> 22:36.775
Gabe. Nice seeing you again.

22:37.318 --> 22:38.319
I'm right behind you.

22:40.070 --> 22:42.198
Guys, I'm
heading out, too. Uhh...

22:42.865 --> 22:44.200
if you need anything

22:44.742 --> 22:45.993
anything at all, just call me.

22:46.202 --> 22:49.246
[soft music]

23:03.719 --> 23:05.304
I'm sorry about earlier.

23:07.139 --> 23:08.307
It's OK. I, uhh...

23:09.975 --> 23:10.976
overreacted.

23:12.853 --> 23:13.854
Well...

23:15.356 --> 23:18.067
I think I know how
you can make it up to me.

23:23.864 --> 23:26.951
[kissing]

23:27.076 --> 23:29.036
It's been far too long.

23:38.754 --> 23:41.841
[heavy breathing]

23:44.718 --> 23:45.719
What?

23:52.560 --> 23:53.561
[sighs]

23:55.229 --> 23:58.232
[music continues]

24:04.989 --> 24:07.324
[music fades]

24:15.791 --> 24:17.501
I can find
nothing physically wrong

24:18.294 --> 24:19.712
more likely, it's psychological.

24:23.883 --> 24:25.092
Then what can we do?

24:25.259 --> 24:27.636
[soft tense music]

24:28.137 --> 24:29.972
Well, I would
normally prescribe Viagra

24:30.973 --> 24:32.975
but due to Andy's
condition and heart flutter

24:33.559 --> 24:34.810
that would be ill-advised.

24:39.648 --> 24:41.025
Well, there's
got to be something.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.744
May I suggest
that the two of you

24:52.369 --> 24:53.579
try new things.

24:54.872 --> 24:56.081
I mean, your life is different

24:56.165 --> 24:57.958
so your sex life is
gonna be different, too.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.002
And you shouldn't
expect what worked

25:00.085 --> 25:01.962
before the accident to work now.

25:05.424 --> 25:07.092
But here, I know
someone who can help.

25:08.344 --> 25:09.845
I've recommended
them in the past.

25:10.930 --> 25:11.931
Whenever you're ready.

25:13.724 --> 25:16.769
[footsteps with crutches]

[paper ripping]

25:24.068 --> 25:25.069
Thank you.

25:27.071 --> 25:28.072
Hey.

25:29.532 --> 25:31.033
Hey, listen man. I can't...

25:31.116 --> 25:32.409
I can't make it out there unless

25:32.493 --> 25:33.577
I don't know where he's at.

25:34.078 --> 25:35.079
Where is he?

25:38.207 --> 25:39.208
Uhuh.

25:41.293 --> 25:42.294
Thanks.

25:44.129 --> 25:45.130
Yeah.

25:45.923 --> 25:47.466
Huh? Yes. Yeah.

25:50.845 --> 25:51.846
What? No.

25:54.515 --> 25:55.516
Why?

26:02.273 --> 26:03.274
Yeah, whatever.

26:08.779 --> 26:11.323
Yeah. OK. Sure. Yeah,
sure, I will. Thanks. Bye.

[taps fingers]

26:28.424 --> 26:30.926
Uhh, can, can I just
get a, double cappuccino?

26:31.468 --> 26:32.887
-The usual?
-Yeah.

26:37.433 --> 26:40.519
[mechanical whirring]

26:52.489 --> 26:53.490

27:00.664 --> 27:02.291

-Well, my pleasure.

27:03.167 --> 27:04.168
Hey, you.

27:06.212 --> 27:07.254
I thought that was you.

27:10.007 --> 27:11.133
Uhh, how are you?

27:11.425 --> 27:12.426
I'm great.

27:12.885 --> 27:13.886
And you?

27:14.929 --> 27:16.096
S-surviving.

27:17.097 --> 27:18.098
Connie is a

27:18.265 --> 27:20.142
flirtatious girl, isn't she?

27:23.103 --> 27:24.438
Umm, what?

27:25.606 --> 27:26.607
Uh, nothing.

27:28.943 --> 27:30.819
Well, it was,
it was nice seeing you

27:30.861 --> 27:32.488
and I really have to be going.

27:33.656 --> 27:35.491
Maybe next time
we can host dinner.

27:42.081 --> 27:43.541

Hey, Linda!

29:47.456 --> 29:48.457
Guess what?

29:51.043 --> 29:52.253
Ted knows his stuff.

29:53.128 --> 29:55.381
Uhh, he just helped me
set up my editing center.

30:00.219 --> 30:01.220

31:02.781 --> 31:03.782
How was Ted?

31:04.241 --> 31:06.911
Uhh, he helped
set up my editing room.

31:09.663 --> 31:10.998
I thought you had a shoot.

31:11.957 --> 31:12.958
They didn't need me.

31:16.712 --> 31:17.713
I'm sorry.

31:20.883 --> 31:22.801
I'm sure business will pick up

31:23.135 --> 31:24.136
you know?

Listen, I'm gonna take
a shower before dinner, so...

31:27.556 --> 31:28.557
OK.

Do you, need any help?

31:32.353 --> 31:33.979
You know, with your...

31:34.647 --> 31:35.731
equipment?

31:37.900 --> 31:38.901
No, thanks.

31:39.068 --> 31:40.069
I'll manage.

I don't know, but...

32:05.302 --> 32:06.679
Uhh, I have to go.

32:07.847 --> 32:08.848
OK.

32:15.813 --> 32:16.814
Who was that?

32:18.482 --> 32:19.483
What?

32:19.984 --> 32:21.193
On the phone. Who was that?

32:21.402 --> 32:23.445
Oh, uhh, Katie, from work.

32:23.779 --> 32:26.156
The Senator is
acting odd recently.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.366
She's concerned.

32:28.492 --> 32:29.493
Drink up.

We can, we can try later.

33:40.981 --> 33:43.317
We shouldn't need
to try! It should just work!

33:47.738 --> 33:48.739
It's OK.

33:49.865 --> 33:51.825
No, it isn't. Stop saying that.

33:52.201 --> 33:53.410
We both know it's not.

You're... you're the therapist?

Doctor Patel refers
plenty of couples to me.

34:51.343 --> 34:52.344
[door closes]

34:56.557 --> 34:58.142
You are more than patients.

34:59.518 --> 35:00.561
You are friends.

35:03.314 --> 35:04.940
Well, how does this work?

35:06.317 --> 35:07.318
Let us talk.

35:07.568 --> 35:08.569
In my office.

Thank you.

36:09.922 --> 36:12.466
Look, I'll be honest. I am...

36:12.800 --> 36:14.343
not sure how much this

36:14.718 --> 36:17.471
therapy session
costs, but, umm... with..

36:18.597 --> 36:19.598
For you two

36:20.182 --> 36:21.350
it's on the house.

36:24.186 --> 36:26.146
[soft fast-paced music]

[door opens]

36:42.162 --> 36:43.163
Yes.

36:47.376 --> 36:48.586
I... Hang on.

36:49.712 --> 36:50.754
Hi. May I help you?

36:51.172 --> 36:53.215
Yeah. Mark Smith,
from Western and Federal?

36:53.299 --> 36:54.466
Oh. Just a moment.

36:55.593 --> 36:57.511
I'm, going to
need to call you back.

36:58.095 --> 36:59.972
OK.
[cradles phone]

37:00.181 --> 37:01.182
May I help you?

37:01.223 --> 37:04.018
Yes, uhh... Mark Smith
from Western and Federal.

37:04.518 --> 37:06.729
I'm here to do
an employment verification

37:06.812 --> 37:08.189
on a, Linda Anderson?

37:08.898 --> 37:10.524
More recently, Linda Larson?

37:11.483 --> 37:13.736
Certainly. Just a moment.
[picks up phone]

37:13.861 --> 37:16.864
[fast-paced soft music]

37:31.337 --> 37:35.299
Hi. Yes, I have an employment
verification request for Linda?

37:37.593 --> 37:39.678
Anderson? Larson? One of those.

37:42.598 --> 37:43.599
OK.

37:43.766 --> 37:44.892
It'll be just a second.

37:45.100 --> 37:48.145
[music continues]

37:52.775 --> 37:53.776
Uhuh?

37:54.944 --> 37:55.945
OK. Thank you.

37:56.612 --> 37:57.613
[cradles phone]

37:57.696 --> 37:59.323
It sounds like Linda Larson

37:59.532 --> 38:01.325
has been employed
by Senator Donahue

38:01.367 --> 38:02.743
for the past few months.

38:02.785 --> 38:04.245
The past few months...

38:04.954 --> 38:06.038
-Thank you.
-Uhuh.

38:07.706 --> 38:08.749
Do you know when?

38:10.042 --> 38:12.002
No, I... I don't, not really.

38:12.086 --> 38:13.796
She's in and
out so much, I barely--

38:13.879 --> 38:15.005
[telephone rings]

38:15.089 --> 38:16.131
Oh, sorry.
[picks up phone]

38:17.174 --> 38:18.175
Yes?

38:21.512 --> 38:22.513
Oh.

38:22.721 --> 38:23.722
Right away.

38:23.806 --> 38:24.807
[cradles phone]

38:25.432 --> 38:28.435
[music continues]

38:31.313 --> 38:33.399

a little emergency.

39:09.101 --> 39:10.603
Yeah. Hey, this is, uhh...

39:11.562 --> 39:13.189
Bridges over in Payroll, umm...

39:13.856 --> 39:15.858
I was wondering if
you still have on file

39:16.317 --> 39:18.569
a resume for,
uhh, Linda Anderson?

39:20.279 --> 39:23.032
Hey, great. Can you
fax that over to me, please?

39:23.324 --> 39:24.700
I'm at 555...

39:25.618 --> 39:26.869

What can I do for you?

39:56.315 --> 39:58.776
Umm... M-my usual.

40:02.446 --> 40:03.531
Coming right up.

[mechanical whirring]

40:35.563 --> 40:36.564
You know

40:36.689 --> 40:38.899
if there is ever anything
else I can ever do for you...

40:39.817 --> 40:40.943
just let me know.

40:54.039 --> 40:55.165
Hey, Robbie man.

40:55.958 --> 40:57.960
Listen, I need you to
help me out with some work.

40:59.962 --> 41:01.630
Well, I've only been
gone for a few weeks

41:01.672 --> 41:03.674
and it seems that all
my gigs are with the shit.

41:05.426 --> 41:06.427
Yep.

41:07.136 --> 41:08.262
Well, listen, man.

41:08.470 --> 41:09.847
My legs aren't the issue.

41:10.472 --> 41:13.684
But it's just
that, umm, you know.

41:14.143 --> 41:16.061
It's not like I'm gonna
be running any marathons

41:16.145 --> 41:17.688
any time soon,
it's just that, you know

41:17.771 --> 41:19.565
I still know how
to operate the camera.

41:19.648 --> 41:20.900
[hissing continues]

41:22.818 --> 41:23.819
All right.

41:24.153 --> 41:25.196
Now you do that.

41:26.197 --> 41:28.032
All right. Any help
you can do would be great.

41:29.450 --> 41:30.618
Thanks. Bye.

-Andy?
-In here.

41:49.220 --> 41:50.513
I figured a nice meal

41:50.554 --> 41:52.765
will help us have
a relaxing evening, and, uhh...

41:52.806 --> 41:55.100
give us a chance to try out
those tricks that we learned.

41:56.769 --> 41:57.770
Have you heard?

42:03.817 --> 42:06.862
[tense music]

42:11.534 --> 42:13.369
<i>The press conference</i>
will begin momentarily

42:13.452 --> 42:15.246
as Senator Donahue will address

42:15.496 --> 42:18.165
<i>recent rumors that his</i>
wife has been filing for divorce

42:18.457 --> 42:20.334
<i>due to recently</i>
rumored infidelity.

42:21.418 --> 42:22.628
And back to you, Phil.

42:23.629 --> 42:24.630
I'm sorry.

42:24.880 --> 42:28.050
[music continues]
[muffled sound on television]

42:40.020 --> 42:41.021
I love you.

42:46.402 --> 42:47.403
Sir, of course.

42:47.987 --> 42:48.988
Yes.

42:51.448 --> 42:52.449
I have to go.

42:52.950 --> 42:54.827
We're on massive
damage control now

42:54.910 --> 42:56.787
with this election
only a year away...

42:59.164 --> 43:00.583
Well, go do
what you've got to do.

43:02.376 --> 43:03.377
Are you sure?

43:04.128 --> 43:05.546
Yeah, I'll be fine. Just, uhh...

43:07.089 --> 43:08.090
go.

43:10.676 --> 43:12.636
Oh. Andy, uhh, can you please

43:12.678 --> 43:14.096
cancel our
appointment with Sabine?

43:15.598 --> 43:16.599
Thank you.

43:29.987 --> 43:33.115
[footsteps]

43:33.490 --> 43:34.909
It is unfortunate.

43:36.869 --> 43:39.121
We will have to have
individual sessions eventually.

43:41.415 --> 43:43.042
Normally, I reschedule, but...

43:43.834 --> 43:44.960
Ted is out of town.

Connie was here for
our previous appointment.

44:16.992 --> 44:18.118
But, aren't you the...

44:18.202 --> 44:19.537
Connie's a private masseuse.

44:20.287 --> 44:21.288
Part-time.

44:23.082 --> 44:25.209
She's very helpful
in these situations.

44:27.169 --> 44:29.213
I find stress is
the number one cause of

44:29.713 --> 44:30.714
most problems.

44:33.259 --> 44:34.718
Please. Undress.

44:35.761 --> 44:36.762
Put the robe on.

You do seem rather tense.

Please come lie face down.

Have you ever had a
full-body massage before?

46:04.975 --> 46:05.976
No.

46:11.232 --> 46:12.525
You're in excellent hands.

46:13.692 --> 46:15.152
I have some
paperwork to attend to.

46:15.528 --> 46:16.654
So I'll leave you two to it.

46:17.196 --> 46:18.781
And see how you're
progressing in a bit.

a lot of tension in your back.

[music continues]

47:50.247 --> 47:51.248
You know

47:52.499 --> 47:54.001
it's said to temporarily

47:54.126 --> 47:55.419
remove inhibitions

47:56.086 --> 47:58.839
especially with certain
herbal cocktails, but, uhh...

48:01.842 --> 48:03.385
I think it's all bullshit.

48:09.099 --> 48:10.100
Roll over?

48:11.769 --> 48:14.813
[music continues]

48:20.569 --> 48:21.570
It's OK.

48:23.656 --> 48:24.657
You know...

48:26.450 --> 48:27.660
I really do like you.

48:28.869 --> 48:30.871
I mean, I'm sure you
hear that all the time, but...

48:32.456 --> 48:34.375
it's unusual for...
[indistinct]

48:35.668 --> 48:38.712
[music continues]

48:42.216 --> 48:43.217
I won't know.

anything like that before.

49:42.109 --> 49:43.402
You were wonderful.

49:44.820 --> 49:45.905
I've, umm...

49:46.238 --> 49:47.615
I've... never...

49:48.824 --> 49:50.034
or done anything...

49:51.076 --> 49:52.411
It'll be our little secret.

Oh. I see you're already done.

50:06.342 --> 50:08.636
How about we finish
this session tomorrow?

50:09.637 --> 50:10.638
With your wife.

50:12.306 --> 50:13.349
That'd be great, thanks.

50:19.605 --> 50:21.440
After a dead-end
background check

50:21.690 --> 50:23.234
you really expect me

50:23.567 --> 50:24.860
to trust you on this?

50:26.570 --> 50:27.571
OK.

50:28.656 --> 50:29.949
OK, if you're sure.

50:30.783 --> 50:32.326
We're still on
for Saturday, right?

50:32.785 --> 50:34.119
[knock on window]
Gotcha.

50:36.372 --> 50:38.040
I'm sorry, sir.
This is private property.

50:38.123 --> 50:39.625
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

50:39.667 --> 50:41.085
I'm just trying to find out if

50:41.168 --> 50:42.920
a friend of mine
who resided here--

50:43.128 --> 50:44.296
Stop right there!

50:44.797 --> 50:46.715
I've already told you,
this is private property.

50:47.132 --> 50:48.175
You either leave now

50:48.425 --> 50:49.677
or I'm gonna call the police.

50:50.052 --> 50:52.555
Seriously, I'm
just trying to find out if

50:52.721 --> 50:55.057
if Linda Anderson resided here.

50:55.683 --> 50:57.726
-She's married to my son--
-Just a moment, sir.

51:03.357 --> 51:04.358
OK, sir. You're good.

51:04.567 --> 51:05.568
Come with me.

51:05.860 --> 51:07.319
Leave the car here
and come with me.

[music continues]

51:40.728 --> 51:42.188
-Linda, please--
-No!

51:42.646 --> 51:44.732
You can't make
a cheating liar look like a

51:44.982 --> 51:46.650
repentant family man.

51:48.027 --> 51:49.028
I've had enough.

51:50.321 --> 51:51.322
I quit.

51:53.157 --> 51:54.158
Andy.

51:57.786 --> 51:59.705
-Let's go.
-What was that all about?

52:01.081 --> 52:03.042
-I'm driving.
-Are you sure?

52:08.130 --> 52:10.799
She did not attend here
for any great period of time.

52:13.302 --> 52:14.428
As much as we'd like to give

52:14.512 --> 52:16.305
the appearances that
we're a finishing school

52:17.014 --> 52:18.015
we're an orphanage.

52:18.807 --> 52:19.808
And as such

52:20.100 --> 52:21.519
we're often
called upon to provide

52:21.602 --> 52:23.395
a safe place to stay for girls

52:23.479 --> 52:25.356
in an unfortunate situation.

52:26.732 --> 52:30.444
And what was Miss Anderson's
unfortunate situation?

52:31.570 --> 52:32.613
She was an orphan.

52:33.322 --> 52:35.282
Her parents died
in an auto accident

52:35.366 --> 52:37.493
and there were no
surviving family members.

52:39.954 --> 52:41.664
How much more
do you really need to know?

52:46.877 --> 52:49.463
Our records show that she
was here for about three months.

52:49.797 --> 52:51.423
And then she
moved to a city home.

52:52.132 --> 52:53.467
I suspect that's
where she stayed

52:53.509 --> 52:55.177
until she became a legal adult.

52:57.096 --> 52:58.889
That's what I found as well.

53:00.307 --> 53:02.017
Then why do you
insist she was here?

53:05.020 --> 53:07.648
No one there at the
time seems to remember her.

53:08.065 --> 53:09.400
Well, I don't
remember her either

53:09.441 --> 53:10.901
and if it weren't
for this paperwork

53:10.943 --> 53:12.111
I wouldn't know who she was.

53:12.945 --> 53:15.114
I have responsibilities
that need to be tended to.

53:17.241 --> 53:18.450
Thank you for your time.

53:20.953 --> 53:24.039
[traffic sounds]

53:27.626 --> 53:29.336
Well, I don't know
what they were thinking.

53:29.420 --> 53:30.838
I mean, the best
thing he can do now

53:30.921 --> 53:33.340
is just apologize and
get out of the race, you know?

53:36.135 --> 53:37.511
Let's get
something to eat instead.

53:38.470 --> 53:40.222
-What's wrong?
-Nothing!

53:40.639 --> 53:43.267
I just, wanted to try out
that new restaurant, and

53:43.976 --> 53:45.352
figured it might
be the last time

53:45.436 --> 53:47.438
we might eat out in
a restaurant in a while.

53:47.521 --> 53:49.815
[soft tense music]

53:49.899 --> 53:52.526
Oh. So this is my fault now.

53:52.568 --> 53:54.278
No! It's not your fault.

53:55.237 --> 53:57.156
You did what you
had to do, you know?

53:58.032 --> 54:00.159
Let's just celebrate
that, you know?

54:01.827 --> 54:04.038
I'm sorry. This
whole thing, is just...

54:06.457 --> 54:08.709
Honey, it's not your fault. OK?

54:08.792 --> 54:11.795
[music continues]

54:16.258 --> 54:17.343
[car door opens]

54:23.224 --> 54:24.225
[car door closes]

54:34.443 --> 54:35.444
Yeah, Bitch.

54:36.570 --> 54:37.571
Forget Linda.

54:38.072 --> 54:39.114
No, I'm... nothing.

54:39.657 --> 54:40.658
[indistinct chatter]

54:41.408 --> 54:42.701
Look, I need info on

54:43.244 --> 54:44.286
Sabine Demming.

54:45.329 --> 54:47.331
I'll text you her
information, OK?

54:48.165 --> 54:49.542
Look. Assume it's all fake.

54:51.418 --> 54:52.419
Yeah.

54:53.128 --> 54:54.129
No, nothing.

54:54.588 --> 54:55.756
But cover your tracks.

55:11.021 --> 55:14.066
[muffled sounds on television]

[music continues]

55:46.640 --> 55:48.184
I just can't
believe it, you know?

55:48.267 --> 55:49.268
I guess...

55:50.060 --> 55:51.395
you just never know.

55:56.483 --> 55:58.027
I'm sure he had his reasons.

56:00.779 --> 56:02.740
If he had problems,
he should have discussed them

56:02.823 --> 56:05.284
with Margaret instead of
running off to some slut.

56:06.160 --> 56:09.205
[soft tense music continues]

56:10.664 --> 56:11.874
If you have a problem

56:11.916 --> 56:14.168
you would talk to me
about it, wouldn't you?

56:17.588 --> 56:18.631
[cutlery clatters]

56:23.594 --> 56:24.595
[door closes]

56:24.887 --> 56:26.680
-It was fun.
-Yeah, it was.

56:26.972 --> 56:29.183
We need to make
a point, every so often

56:29.225 --> 56:30.434
to just take a day

56:31.101 --> 56:32.186
just to be together.

56:33.562 --> 56:35.314
Without quitting jobs, though.

56:35.481 --> 56:36.482
Agreed.

57:19.942 --> 57:21.277
Oh, hi, Ted. How can I help you?

57:21.318 --> 57:22.403
A huge favor.

57:22.862 --> 57:24.864
Sabine is filming
one of her sessions, and

57:25.489 --> 57:27.074
her regular guy didn't show.

57:29.618 --> 57:32.246
Umm, normally we
pay 500 for this, but...

57:32.788 --> 57:33.789
since its last minute

57:33.873 --> 57:35.958
we'll pay you an extra 500
once the job is finished.

57:37.501 --> 57:38.669
No more quitting, right?

57:40.880 --> 57:43.883

57:45.634 --> 57:48.721
[footsteps]
[soft tense music]

57:52.433 --> 57:53.434
In here.

57:59.940 --> 58:01.317
So you're gonna
set up around here.

58:01.817 --> 58:03.944
The action's gonna take
place on the couch over here.

58:05.112 --> 58:08.199
[music continues]

58:20.753 --> 58:22.004
I'm so glad you could help out.

58:22.880 --> 58:23.881
No problem.

58:24.840 --> 58:26.383
The participants
will be here shortly.

58:27.510 --> 58:29.512
Since this is an
official therapy session

58:29.595 --> 58:31.347
what happens here
must never be discussed.

58:32.473 --> 58:34.808
This is doctor-patient
privileged information.

58:35.768 --> 58:37.978
So discretion is
absolutely necessary.

58:39.063 --> 58:40.105
Do you understand?

58:41.315 --> 58:42.316
Yes, certainly.

58:43.108 --> 58:46.111
[music continues]

58:50.032 --> 58:51.033
Thank you, Ted.

58:53.994 --> 58:54.995
This is Andy.

58:55.162 --> 58:56.747
He will be
recording our session.

58:57.414 --> 58:58.874
Just as with our
previous sessions

58:58.999 --> 59:00.668
this recording will
be for your homework.

59:04.505 --> 59:05.714
Start recording when I say.

59:06.006 --> 59:07.174
Stop, when told.

59:07.383 --> 59:08.801
Who is Mr Michaels?

59:09.468 --> 59:11.303
He is a patient. That is all.

59:16.559 --> 59:17.810
So let's get started.

59:19.186 --> 59:20.312
Please start recording.

59:24.525 --> 59:27.403
So, last week we
explored your fantasies.

59:28.195 --> 59:29.196
Did that help?

59:29.947 --> 59:30.948
[grunts]

59:32.783 --> 59:34.034
He's a new man.

59:38.122 --> 59:39.665
Since you two
have given yourself over

59:39.707 --> 59:40.749
to open communication

59:41.083 --> 59:43.586
nothing that is said now
should come as a surprise.

59:46.172 --> 59:47.173
No surprises.

59:50.217 --> 59:52.219
Repeat, for
the camera, your desire.

[clears throat]

1:00:02.188 --> 1:00:03.189
It's OK.

1:00:05.900 --> 1:00:07.401
This is a safe environment.

1:00:09.528 --> 1:00:10.654
No one is judging

1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:12.281
limiting.

1:00:13.741 --> 1:00:14.909
This is all for you.

[clears throat]

1:00:21.832 --> 1:00:22.833
Go on.

1:00:24.585 --> 1:00:25.586
Well, umm...

1:00:28.088 --> 1:00:29.215
When I was a teen

1:00:30.716 --> 1:00:31.926
coming into my own

1:00:32.384 --> 1:00:33.636
umm, I...

1:00:34.136 --> 1:00:35.804
fell in love with two boys.

1:00:38.849 --> 1:00:40.184
I didn't know
what to do with that

1:00:40.267 --> 1:00:41.936
so I lost them both.

1:00:46.732 --> 1:00:48.067
And now that
I'm grown and married

1:00:48.984 --> 1:00:49.985
I often have

1:00:51.237 --> 1:00:52.238
this dream.

1:00:53.864 --> 1:00:56.909
[music continues]

1:01:00.496 --> 1:01:01.497
I dream that

1:01:01.747 --> 1:01:04.375
I'm having sex with them both.

1:01:08.170 --> 1:01:09.171
Well...

1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:11.882
So that's my dream.

1:01:13.133 --> 1:01:14.718
To have sex with two men.

1:01:15.845 --> 1:01:16.887

Andy, what's up, man?

1:01:30.442 --> 1:01:31.735
What the hell was that in there?

1:01:32.278 --> 1:01:33.571
What, they didn't want to do it?

1:01:33.779 --> 1:01:34.780
I didn't.

1:01:34.989 --> 1:01:36.448
I'll get my equipment tomorrow.

1:01:36.490 --> 1:01:37.908
Andy. Andy!

[footsteps approaching]

1:01:53.090 --> 1:01:54.216
What's wrong?

1:01:55.676 --> 1:01:56.844
I don't think we should have

1:01:56.886 --> 1:01:58.470
anything more to
do with the neighbors.

1:01:59.221 --> 1:02:00.264
Why? What happened?

1:02:01.390 --> 1:02:02.433
If you really want to know

1:02:02.516 --> 1:02:04.393
they wanted me to
film someone having sex.

1:02:05.728 --> 1:02:06.729
Really?

1:02:06.896 --> 1:02:07.897
Yeah.

1:02:08.272 --> 1:02:09.565
Made me feel like a fool.

1:02:10.316 --> 1:02:12.526
It's just crazy. Why didn't
they just tell me about it?

1:02:12.735 --> 1:02:14.945
Well, they definitely
should have told you beforehand.

1:02:15.029 --> 1:02:16.113
I guess it was always an...

1:02:16.822 --> 1:02:18.741
you know, a possibility, but...

1:02:20.367 --> 1:02:21.535
Would you have said no?

1:02:21.869 --> 1:02:23.454
Damn right I would have said no.

1:02:25.956 --> 1:02:27.333
I mean, I don't know. I just...

1:02:29.251 --> 1:02:31.462
Talking about sex
is one thing. I just...

1:02:32.254 --> 1:02:34.798
I just wish they would have,
told me about it sooner.

1:02:35.216 --> 1:02:36.509
No, I know. It's OK.

1:02:36.675 --> 1:02:38.427
Here, just drink this.

1:02:39.136 --> 1:02:40.137
Calm down.

1:02:41.597 --> 1:02:42.598
So is this couple

1:02:43.766 --> 1:02:44.934
really hot?

Umm...

1:02:51.106 --> 1:02:52.107
They were old.

1:02:53.108 --> 1:02:54.276
Oh. Ugh.

1:02:55.110 --> 1:02:56.654
Yeah. No, right?
[chuckles]

1:02:57.947 --> 1:03:00.032
So if it were a
young, attractive couple

1:03:00.074 --> 1:03:01.283
it would have been all right?

1:03:04.161 --> 1:03:05.371
I didn't say that.

Andy, I am so sorry about that.

1:03:17.633 --> 1:03:20.511
-I thought, Sabine had told you.
-She didn't.

1:03:21.720 --> 1:03:22.721
I, I think...

1:03:22.847 --> 1:03:24.473
she thought
somehow it'd help you.

1:03:25.391 --> 1:03:26.892
But that's no excuse, I know.

1:03:27.643 --> 1:03:28.894
Here's your payment in full.

1:03:32.022 --> 1:03:33.023
[paper crackling]

1:03:33.148 --> 1:03:34.942
Again, I'm... I'm so sorry.

1:03:46.370 --> 1:03:47.371
Well...

1:03:47.830 --> 1:03:49.665
I guess I'm a
professional pornographer now.

1:03:51.458 --> 1:03:54.128
So what, uhh,
we were doing then is...

1:03:54.837 --> 1:03:55.838
amateur?

1:03:57.965 --> 1:03:58.966
Come here.

Come here!

1:04:23.490 --> 1:04:24.491
Come on, baby.

1:04:28.579 --> 1:04:29.580
Come on, baby.

1:04:55.231 --> 1:04:56.607
I don’t want to rush anything

1:04:57.691 --> 1:04:58.692
but I...

1:04:58.901 --> 1:05:00.027
It is understandable.

1:05:01.445 --> 1:05:03.614
You both have needs
that are not being met.

1:05:08.619 --> 1:05:10.162
But patience is needed.

1:05:10.955 --> 1:05:12.623
Now, more than ever.

1:05:14.875 --> 1:05:17.920
[phone buzzing]

1:05:22.716 --> 1:05:24.260
OK? It's getting late.

1:05:24.635 --> 1:05:26.846
Remember to practice
your self-pleasure exercises.

1:05:27.346 --> 1:05:28.681
If you can't satisfy yourself

1:05:28.848 --> 1:05:30.474
how can you
expect your partner to?

1:05:40.734 --> 1:05:41.735
Here! Hey?

1:05:42.611 --> 1:05:44.154
-What was that?
-What?

1:05:45.447 --> 1:05:47.283
It was like you didn't
even want to be there.

1:05:47.741 --> 1:05:49.743
I'm just starting to think
this is all a bad idea.

1:05:51.495 --> 1:05:54.540

1:06:16.395 --> 1:06:17.563

Shit.

1:06:20.691 --> 1:06:22.860
Call me back,
Fitch, I'm getting worried.

I like a man that
knows his whiskey.

1:07:03.609 --> 1:07:06.278
I suspect you were just
a baby when this was bottled.

1:07:07.571 --> 1:07:09.698
Well, then I'd say
we've both aged marvelously.

1:07:14.245 --> 1:07:15.246
So what brings you here?

1:07:15.829 --> 1:07:18.499
Don't tell me it's one of these
boring business conferences.

1:07:19.834 --> 1:07:20.835
No.

1:07:20.918 --> 1:07:22.253
Just visiting a few friends.

1:07:23.754 --> 1:07:24.755
Well...

1:07:25.089 --> 1:07:27.716
I am here for one of these
boring business conferences.

1:07:28.509 --> 1:07:30.886
But, I always wear
my sexy dress, because...

1:07:32.346 --> 1:07:33.556
Just in case I find somebody

1:07:33.639 --> 1:07:35.432
worth killing
a little bit of time with.

[indistinct chatter]

1:07:56.328 --> 1:07:59.498
You must have lived an awful
interesting life, Mr Larson.

1:07:59.915 --> 1:08:01.500
The amount of E I've given you

1:08:01.625 --> 1:08:04.211
should have slowed
you down much more.

1:08:04.628 --> 1:08:05.629
Hmm.

1:08:08.174 --> 1:08:09.717
[ominous music]
What is this?

1:08:10.467 --> 1:08:11.719
An interesting ending.

[crack]
[dramatic music]

1:08:15.931 --> 1:08:17.683
And I was hoping we
could have a little fun

1:08:17.766 --> 1:08:19.018
before the night was over.

1:08:19.393 --> 1:08:20.394
Hmm.

1:08:23.731 --> 1:08:24.815
Good night.

1:08:27.902 --> 1:08:28.903
[door opens]

1:08:47.755 --> 1:08:48.964
I'm gonna go get ready.

1:08:49.965 --> 1:08:52.510
Remember, we have another
appointment with Sabine today.

1:08:56.222 --> 1:08:59.183
Unless, you want
to stop seeing her.

1:09:02.645 --> 1:09:04.772
Mmm, she's our neighbor, so...

1:09:05.356 --> 1:09:06.357
And she's free.

1:09:09.443 --> 1:09:10.736
But, if you want...

1:09:12.821 --> 1:09:14.114
[doorbell rings]

1:09:16.784 --> 1:09:19.828
[soft music]

1:09:23.999 --> 1:09:25.000
[door opens]

1:09:27.044 --> 1:09:28.212
I'm Detective May.

1:09:28.379 --> 1:09:29.964
-Are you Andy Larson?
-Yes.

1:09:30.673 --> 1:09:31.674
Mr Larson, I have some

1:09:31.757 --> 1:09:33.342
unfortunate news
about your father.

1:09:33.592 --> 1:09:34.593
May I come in?

1:09:35.511 --> 1:09:36.512
All right.

1:09:41.433 --> 1:09:42.434
[door closes]

1:09:42.518 --> 1:09:45.563
[music continues]

1:09:47.857 --> 1:09:48.858
Mr Larson

1:09:49.775 --> 1:09:52.486
at approximately
10 a.m. this morning

1:09:53.612 --> 1:09:55.739
your father was found
dead in his hotel room.

1:10:00.536 --> 1:10:02.580
Hotel? I, I don't understand.

1:10:07.376 --> 1:10:08.627
Yes, sir. You know...

1:10:10.254 --> 1:10:11.881
It looks like it
was a heart attack

1:10:12.673 --> 1:10:14.675
possibly triggered
by the ingestion

1:10:14.758 --> 1:10:16.468
of alcohol and ecstasy.

1:10:18.345 --> 1:10:20.097
We're awaiting the
official results now.

1:10:24.101 --> 1:10:25.186
Mr Larson

1:10:25.895 --> 1:10:28.898
were you aware that your
father was taking illicit drugs?

1:10:30.357 --> 1:10:31.358
I...

1:10:31.609 --> 1:10:33.861
I knew he had that problem
when we were kids, I just...

1:10:34.403 --> 1:10:35.696
I thought he was clean now.

1:10:36.405 --> 1:10:37.406
What happened?

1:10:37.698 --> 1:10:38.991
My father, he's dead.

1:10:39.074 --> 1:10:42.077
[music continues]

1:10:43.204 --> 1:10:44.205
I...

1:10:45.706 --> 1:10:47.124
I am sorry for your loss.

1:10:49.793 --> 1:10:50.794
Now...

1:10:51.086 --> 1:10:52.087
these...

1:10:52.671 --> 1:10:54.381
are the
instructions for retrieving

1:10:54.423 --> 1:10:56.050
your father's
personal effects and

1:10:57.301 --> 1:10:59.178
for the arranging
and the handling of his body.

1:11:01.096 --> 1:11:02.515
He was clean for years.

1:11:04.308 --> 1:11:06.393
Mr Larson, I truly
am sorry for your loss.

1:11:07.770 --> 1:11:08.771
Yeah.

1:11:09.188 --> 1:11:12.233
[music continues]

1:11:21.659 --> 1:11:23.452
It doesn't make any sense.

1:11:24.954 --> 1:11:26.038
And I don't believe it.

1:11:35.548 --> 1:11:38.050
Well, maybe he didn't
want to talk about it.

1:11:39.426 --> 1:11:40.427
I would think

1:11:41.303 --> 1:11:42.555
he was embarrassed.

1:11:44.765 --> 1:11:46.725
What was he doing at a hotel?

1:11:54.066 --> 1:11:57.069
I'm gonna cancel our appointment
tonight, with Sabine.

1:12:00.072 --> 1:12:01.156
[plate scraping]

1:12:02.199 --> 1:12:04.118
Or I might, go alone.

1:12:09.081 --> 1:12:10.124
[chair scraping]

1:12:18.132 --> 1:12:21.177

1:12:30.311 --> 1:12:31.312
[ring tone]

1:12:33.814 --> 1:12:34.815
Detective May.

1:12:35.691 --> 1:12:37.026
This is Andy Larson.

1:12:37.526 --> 1:12:39.486
I was just wondering
if you could tell me

1:12:39.528 --> 1:12:41.071
why my father was at the hotel.

1:12:42.406 --> 1:12:43.407
Look.

1:12:43.449 --> 1:12:44.867
I'll be honest
with you, Mr Larson.

1:12:44.909 --> 1:12:47.161
There is something that
was left out of the report.

1:12:47.912 --> 1:12:50.206
We weren't going to
release it, but I can tell you.

1:12:51.415 --> 1:12:52.458
What does that mean?

1:12:54.251 --> 1:12:55.377
[sighs]
Well...

1:12:55.794 --> 1:12:57.671
he was found in the
company of a prostitute.

1:12:59.048 --> 1:13:01.759
Now, I know his
death was still natural.

1:13:02.343 --> 1:13:03.761
And we're thinking that she ran.

1:13:03.844 --> 1:13:05.262
It's what we're looking for now.

1:13:06.764 --> 1:13:08.891
I'm gonna tell you,
though. Other than...

1:13:09.183 --> 1:13:10.434
possibly some other lead

1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:14.355
<i>there's really not much</i>
that we can charge her with.

1:13:14.438 --> 1:13:17.525
[music continues]

1:13:21.695 --> 1:13:22.696
What hotel?

1:13:24.365 --> 1:13:25.866
Well, the hotel's upstate.

1:13:27.451 --> 1:13:29.161
I, I can text you the address

1:13:29.203 --> 1:13:31.830
but honestly, I
suggest you just mourn his...

1:13:32.289 --> 1:13:33.791
mourn him, and let it go.

1:13:37.253 --> 1:13:38.254
No.

1:13:39.547 --> 1:13:40.548
[phone beeps]

1:13:40.840 --> 1:13:43.926
[music continues]

1:14:08.075 --> 1:14:11.120

Linda!

1:14:33.726 --> 1:14:36.770
[music continues]

1:14:57.166 --> 1:14:59.293
Sabine gives her condolences.

1:15:01.170 --> 1:15:02.755
What did she say
when you canceled?

1:15:04.089 --> 1:15:07.092
She wasn't surprised,
given the circumstances.

1:15:09.178 --> 1:15:10.179
Hm.

1:15:24.235 --> 1:15:25.569
-Morning.
-Morning.

1:15:27.154 --> 1:15:28.155
[kiss]

1:15:28.906 --> 1:15:31.116
Are you, going
on a jog this morning?

1:15:31.492 --> 1:15:32.493
[slurps]

1:15:33.035 --> 1:15:36.163
No, umm, I'm gonna
go out to do some research.

1:15:41.210 --> 1:15:43.379
You know we've had
quite a rough year, but...

1:15:43.754 --> 1:15:44.755
Umm...

1:15:45.047 --> 1:15:46.507
We're gonna make
it through together.

1:15:51.846 --> 1:15:52.847
I love you.

1:15:53.848 --> 1:15:54.849
[kiss]

1:15:55.391 --> 1:15:56.976
I'll make you some breakfast.

1:15:57.601 --> 1:15:58.769
I appreciate it, but, umm...

1:15:58.894 --> 1:16:00.396
I might grab
something while I'm up.

1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:07.444
[phone keypad beeping]

1:16:13.993 --> 1:16:15.536
This is Andy Larson.

1:16:16.370 --> 1:16:19.164
I spoke with your
manager earlier, umm...

1:16:20.332 --> 1:16:21.750
Thank you. Umm...

1:16:22.376 --> 1:16:23.961
I had some
questions I was hoping

1:16:24.044 --> 1:16:25.129
you could help me out with.

1:16:25.754 --> 1:16:28.132
Could you tell me how
many days he had booked?

1:16:28.507 --> 1:16:31.552
[restaurant sounds]

1:16:33.345 --> 1:16:34.597
OK. Thank you.

1:16:35.431 --> 1:16:37.224
Did he say why
he was staying there?

1:16:40.186 --> 1:16:41.187
Hmm.

1:16:42.229 --> 1:16:43.898
No, he... he was retired.

1:16:46.066 --> 1:16:47.610
Maybe he was visiting a friend.

1:16:49.945 --> 1:16:51.739
I, I don't know
why he was there.

1:16:52.615 --> 1:16:54.950
God, I mean he... he
would know the answer to that.

1:16:59.413 --> 1:17:02.333
Well, can you... can you
tell me if he made any calls?

1:17:04.335 --> 1:17:05.628
Any inbound calls?

1:17:10.049 --> 1:17:11.050
OK.

1:17:11.091 --> 1:17:12.426
Could you give me that number?

1:17:20.976 --> 1:17:22.520
Great. Big help.

1:17:23.020 --> 1:17:24.813
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

1:17:25.397 --> 1:17:26.440
All right. Take care.

1:17:26.732 --> 1:17:27.733
Bye.

1:17:51.590 --> 1:17:52.591
Gabe's son?

1:17:53.175 --> 1:17:55.261
I need to hear from you a.s.a.p.

1:20:42.136 --> 1:20:43.262
You were gone a while?

1:20:46.640 --> 1:20:48.225
Did you find what
you were looking for?

1:20:48.809 --> 1:20:49.935
I didn't find anything.

1:20:50.978 --> 1:20:53.606
Then again, I'm not even sure
if there's anything to find.

1:20:57.443 --> 1:20:58.652
Maybe I can help.

Andy?

1:21:19.798 --> 1:21:20.883
We heard about Gabe.

1:21:21.383 --> 1:21:22.384
I'm very sorry.

1:21:22.676 --> 1:21:23.761
He was a great guy.

1:21:24.261 --> 1:21:26.764
I only wish I would have gotten
the chance to know him better.

1:21:32.019 --> 1:21:33.020
Oh!

1:21:34.563 --> 1:21:36.023
We still have
your camera equipment.

1:21:36.524 --> 1:21:38.359
We're having a party
this week, and I was just

1:21:38.400 --> 1:21:40.653
wondering when you were
gonna come by and collect them.

1:21:43.531 --> 1:21:45.199
I can get it
right now if that's OK?

1:21:45.241 --> 1:21:46.242
Sure.

1:21:49.161 --> 1:21:50.996
Sabine took the memory card out.

1:21:52.373 --> 1:21:53.707
We'll give it
back to you once we

1:21:53.999 --> 1:21:55.960
wiped... wiped
the footage off clean.

1:21:59.296 --> 1:22:00.339
You need a drink?

1:22:08.389 --> 1:22:09.390
Hello, Andy.

1:22:10.266 --> 1:22:11.267
Hi.

1:22:13.602 --> 1:22:15.145
It is a shame about your father.

1:22:16.856 --> 1:22:17.857
If I had known

1:22:18.190 --> 1:22:20.025
I could have helped
him through his addiction.

1:22:20.734 --> 1:22:22.528
What... what do you
know about what happened?

1:22:24.238 --> 1:22:26.574
It's a shame men can't
talk about these things.

1:22:29.285 --> 1:22:30.953
I wish you wouldn't
talk about him at all.

1:22:39.003 --> 1:22:42.006
[loud footsteps]

1:22:43.841 --> 1:22:44.842
You're leaving?

1:22:45.593 --> 1:22:46.594
Andy.

1:22:46.844 --> 1:22:48.596
This is your
father's favorite scotch.

Where's Connie?

1:23:17.208 --> 1:23:18.209
Umm...

1:23:18.375 --> 1:23:21.128
I don't know, I, just got in.

1:23:22.213 --> 1:23:23.255
Hm. Can you ask?

1:23:27.801 --> 1:23:30.179
I'm kind of busy with
the morning rush. I'm sorry.

1:23:30.763 --> 1:23:33.807
[soft tense music]

1:23:39.230 --> 1:23:40.356
Hey, stranger.

1:23:41.023 --> 1:23:42.858
I was wondering when
you'd come back for more.

1:23:43.817 --> 1:23:45.486
I want to know
what happened that night.

1:23:46.487 --> 1:23:48.405
You know exactly
what happened that night.

1:23:49.907 --> 1:23:51.534
I wouldn't mind
if it happened again.

1:23:51.575 --> 1:23:52.576
I wouldn't.

1:23:52.660 --> 1:23:54.453
You didn't do anything
you didn't want to do.

1:23:56.038 --> 1:23:57.039
I didn't.

1:23:57.206 --> 1:23:58.582
-Argh!
-It must have been something

1:23:58.666 --> 1:24:00.876
in the oil or in the
incense or something, but...

1:24:01.919 --> 1:24:02.920
You tricked me.

1:24:03.504 --> 1:24:06.841
Geez. You feel guilty and
now you want to blame me.

1:24:07.508 --> 1:24:09.885
Must be the girl's
fault, she's just a whore.

1:24:11.846 --> 1:24:12.847
You did it.

1:24:12.888 --> 1:24:13.973
So deal with it.

1:24:15.057 --> 1:24:16.141
You're so typical.

1:24:17.768 --> 1:24:18.769
Fuck off now.

1:24:40.249 --> 1:24:41.625
of her special
dinner parties, and

1:24:41.750 --> 1:24:43.085
we'd like for
you two to join us.

1:24:47.590 --> 1:24:48.591
I don't know.

1:24:48.674 --> 1:24:50.968
It's being catered by
one of Austin's top chefs.

1:24:51.177 --> 1:24:53.888
Well, according to one of those
foodie magazines, at least.

1:24:56.599 --> 1:24:58.809
You don't have to stay the
whole time, mind you, but...

1:24:59.018 --> 1:25:01.729
Please come and eat the food.
I want to get my money's worth.

1:25:02.938 --> 1:25:04.190
Well, it sounds great to me.

1:25:04.565 --> 1:25:06.734
Fantastic!
Sabine will be so happy.

1:25:07.109 --> 1:25:10.196

1:26:01.872 --> 1:26:04.875
[music continues]

1:26:13.551 --> 1:26:14.552
What happened?

1:26:19.682 --> 1:26:21.350
Well, I knew he was watching.

1:26:22.309 --> 1:26:23.310
And...

1:26:24.979 --> 1:26:26.438
He didn't do anything.

1:26:29.066 --> 1:26:30.484
I can tell you're stressed.

1:26:32.111 --> 1:26:34.113
<i>It's hard to think</i>
straight with all that tension.

1:26:36.073 --> 1:26:38.284
<i>I find that stress is</i>
the number one cause

1:26:38.325 --> 1:26:39.785
of marital difficulties.

1:26:43.497 --> 1:26:45.082
<i>I think I have</i>
something that will help.

1:26:48.752 --> 1:26:49.753
[door opens]

1:26:52.756 --> 1:26:53.757
Dan.

1:26:54.466 --> 1:26:55.467
He's an expert

1:26:56.594 --> 1:26:58.554
at full-body massage.

1:27:02.766 --> 1:27:04.018
What is this?

1:27:04.685 --> 1:27:05.978
[Linda] Dinner's ready!

1:27:07.271 --> 1:27:10.316
[rustling]

1:27:28.250 --> 1:27:29.418
Did you see Sabine?

1:27:30.294 --> 1:27:31.378
What do you mean?

1:27:31.837 --> 1:27:33.005
In a private session.

1:27:33.631 --> 1:27:34.632
Did you?

1:27:36.842 --> 1:27:38.135
Yes, just once.

1:27:38.469 --> 1:27:39.595
Really? What happened?

1:27:43.140 --> 1:27:44.141
What happened?

1:27:45.100 --> 1:27:47.144
Well, you saw her in
a private session, didn't you?

1:27:47.811 --> 1:27:49.021
What happened in yours?

1:27:51.565 --> 1:27:52.775
W-we just talked.

1:27:53.150 --> 1:27:54.235
[chair scraping]

1:27:54.652 --> 1:27:56.904
That's all we
did, Andy. Just talk.

1:27:57.947 --> 1:27:59.823
Enough about
Sabine and her therapy.

1:28:00.574 --> 1:28:01.617
[chair scraping]

1:28:09.166 --> 1:28:10.167
[ring tone]

1:28:11.168 --> 1:28:12.294
[soft tense music]

1:28:12.336 --> 1:28:13.796
Hey, honey.
Uhh, what do you want me

1:28:13.838 --> 1:28:15.172
to bring home
for dinner tonight?

1:28:18.884 --> 1:28:19.885
Shit.

1:28:20.052 --> 1:28:22.346
Shit. Honey, can you just
get us out of that, please?

1:28:24.974 --> 1:28:27.059
All right. You know what,
then I'll get us out of it

1:28:27.101 --> 1:28:28.185
if it has to be that way.

1:28:29.436 --> 1:28:32.481
[music continues]

1:28:32.815 --> 1:28:33.816
Bye.

1:28:36.277 --> 1:28:39.321
[car engine]

1:28:46.495 --> 1:28:47.538
[car door opens]

1:28:47.705 --> 1:28:50.708
[music continues]

1:28:50.958 --> 1:28:51.959
[car door closes]

1:28:57.298 --> 1:28:59.258
I'm so glad you'll be
coming to dinner tonight.

1:29:00.342 --> 1:29:01.677
With your lovely wife.

1:29:03.220 --> 1:29:04.221
Well, I'm...

1:29:04.305 --> 1:29:05.306
not even sure...

1:29:05.389 --> 1:29:06.682
We're all looking forward to it.

1:29:08.267 --> 1:29:10.269
And it's nice to go out
of the house on occasion.

1:29:11.187 --> 1:29:12.980
I don't think we're
gonna be able to make it.

1:29:14.356 --> 1:29:15.566
[car door opens, closed]

1:29:17.401 --> 1:29:19.069
I'm truly sorry to hear that.

1:29:20.279 --> 1:29:22.865
I would think Linda's
looking forward to this night.

1:29:24.658 --> 1:29:26.911
But if you have a
reason to not come over

1:29:28.120 --> 1:29:29.246
I can understand.

1:29:31.707 --> 1:29:32.708
But will Linda?

1:29:35.419 --> 1:29:36.962
Secrets have a way of...

1:29:37.463 --> 1:29:39.048
poisoning relationships.

1:29:40.090 --> 1:29:43.260
Especially if they
don't remain secret.

1:29:43.636 --> 1:29:46.805
[tense music builds, ends]

1:29:47.890 --> 1:29:50.935
[street sounds]

1:29:58.359 --> 1:29:59.860
I didn't think
you wanted to come.

1:30:00.736 --> 1:30:02.488
It's nice to get out
every once in a while.

1:30:06.659 --> 1:30:07.993
Wonder what they're serving.

1:30:08.827 --> 1:30:10.079
I suspect, food.

1:30:16.710 --> 1:30:19.004
This is a great meal,
thank you for having us.

1:30:19.171 --> 1:30:21.507
[indistinct chatter]

1:30:21.590 --> 1:30:24.301
[indistinct chatter]

1:30:24.385 --> 1:30:28.013
[indistinct chatter]

1:30:28.264 --> 1:30:29.306
Sorry for the wait.

1:30:29.348 --> 1:30:30.349
Thank you.

1:30:34.019 --> 1:30:35.229
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1:30:35.563 --> 1:30:36.730
You know, this wine has a

1:30:37.523 --> 1:30:39.567
taste that tempted the gods.
[glasses clinking]

1:30:39.817 --> 1:30:41.652
[indistinct chatter]

1:30:42.236 --> 1:30:44.238
Now you'll get my
husband started on religion.

1:30:44.280 --> 1:30:45.531
Oh, honey.

1:30:45.948 --> 1:30:48.242
It's just a tool to
codify ancient laws.

1:30:49.201 --> 1:30:50.202
Way to go.

1:30:51.829 --> 1:30:53.163
Is that a bad thing?

1:30:53.622 --> 1:30:55.207
The laws, that is?

1:30:55.916 --> 1:30:57.209
If you're a woman, it is.

1:30:58.043 --> 1:30:59.879
Maybe that's just
how women wanted it.

1:31:00.629 --> 1:31:01.755
-What do you mean?
-What?

1:31:02.464 --> 1:31:03.465
Well...

1:31:03.716 --> 1:31:06.051
Prior to the Bible,
the Testament's older than that.

1:31:06.677 --> 1:31:07.678
Women ruled.

1:31:08.762 --> 1:31:10.222
They were the life-givers.

1:31:11.098 --> 1:31:12.183
They were worshiped.

1:31:15.227 --> 1:31:16.979
Then, men screwed it up.

1:31:17.313 --> 1:31:20.357
Ohh!
[all laugh]

1:31:20.482 --> 1:31:21.483
Right.

1:31:22.401 --> 1:31:23.611
It was inevitable.

1:31:24.737 --> 1:31:27.072
Men figured they had something
to do with creating life

1:31:27.239 --> 1:31:29.033
and thought that
might equaled right.

1:31:30.367 --> 1:31:31.744
Not much different than today.

1:31:34.038 --> 1:31:35.706
If women wanted the power back

1:31:35.956 --> 1:31:37.499
could they just
charge in with an army?

1:31:38.125 --> 1:31:39.168
No.
[music continues]

1:31:40.085 --> 1:31:41.837
At that time they
had little real power.

1:31:43.088 --> 1:31:45.382
What they had
is what we have now.

1:31:46.550 --> 1:31:47.551
A child's love.

1:31:48.594 --> 1:31:49.595
Arts.

1:31:50.221 --> 1:31:51.222
And sex.

1:31:51.305 --> 1:31:54.266
[music continues]

1:31:54.308 --> 1:31:55.309
[chuckles]

1:31:56.685 --> 1:31:57.686
Don't I know it.

1:31:58.521 --> 1:31:59.563
More wine, anyone?

1:32:00.773 --> 1:32:01.774
So where was I?

1:32:02.900 --> 1:32:04.568
You were telling us
what it would be like

1:32:05.152 --> 1:32:06.320
if women were in charge.

1:32:07.279 --> 1:32:09.240
Or, how they would control them.

1:32:11.909 --> 1:32:13.244
Well, wait a minute.

1:32:13.536 --> 1:32:14.870
Wouldn't men just stop them?

1:32:15.204 --> 1:32:16.205
Yes.

1:32:17.039 --> 1:32:18.832
If they ever knew
they were being controlled.

1:32:20.376 --> 1:32:21.961
It would have to
be done in secret

1:32:22.294 --> 1:32:23.379
with long goals.

1:32:25.381 --> 1:32:26.382
How?

1:32:26.882 --> 1:32:28.968
These women would
have to use their power

1:32:29.260 --> 1:32:30.928
but at the time
it was little enough.

1:32:31.804 --> 1:32:33.722
So in order to
really use their power

1:32:34.223 --> 1:32:36.392
they needed to make
their strengths more valuable.

1:32:38.102 --> 1:32:40.229
So while these men
were writing their doctrines

1:32:40.437 --> 1:32:41.647
and codifying their Bible

1:32:42.565 --> 1:32:43.983
they were writing in stone

1:32:44.191 --> 1:32:45.734
the tools to their own control.

1:32:47.611 --> 1:32:50.781
"Strong families" and
"sex is sin" were just a couple.

1:32:53.284 --> 1:32:54.285
How can

1:32:54.326 --> 1:32:56.537
making "sex is sin"
increase its power?

1:32:56.996 --> 1:32:57.997
That's easy enough.

1:32:59.164 --> 1:33:00.291
Take Linda's senator.

1:33:01.750 --> 1:33:03.085
Would he be at this very moment

1:33:03.169 --> 1:33:05.880
announcing his
resignation from public office

1:33:05.963 --> 1:33:07.423
if sex were not a sin?

1:33:07.506 --> 1:33:10.176
[music continues]

1:33:10.634 --> 1:33:12.511
Why did you come to
my dinner tonight, Andy?

1:33:15.389 --> 1:33:16.390
I...

1:33:16.473 --> 1:33:18.642
You didn't want Linda
to find out your little secret.

1:33:20.477 --> 1:33:21.478
What secret?

1:33:21.770 --> 1:33:24.857
[music continues]

1:33:26.650 --> 1:33:27.651
Linda.

1:33:28.152 --> 1:33:29.570
-I...
-Face it.

1:33:30.654 --> 1:33:32.156
If you were open and honest

1:33:32.198 --> 1:33:34.158
with Linda you wouldn't
be in this situation.

1:33:36.327 --> 1:33:38.913
Or rather...
if sex were not a sin.

1:33:40.289 --> 1:33:41.790
[chuckles]

1:33:42.416 --> 1:33:43.542
Do you understand now?

1:33:48.172 --> 1:33:49.924
What is she talking about?

1:33:51.467 --> 1:33:52.468
Andy!

1:33:54.595 --> 1:33:55.596
I cheated.

1:33:57.515 --> 1:33:58.516
I...

1:34:00.351 --> 1:34:02.353
I can't believe you! I...

1:34:05.189 --> 1:34:06.857
I can't believe you. I...

1:34:07.483 --> 1:34:10.110
I stood by you. I tried.

1:34:12.488 --> 1:34:13.906
-I loved you--
-Linda!

1:34:13.989 --> 1:34:14.990
[ominous crash]

1:34:20.329 --> 1:34:21.330
[loud bump]

1:34:23.541 --> 1:34:25.459
[crashes on to floor]

1:34:32.716 --> 1:34:33.717
Linda is ours.

1:34:34.677 --> 1:34:35.970
She always has been.

1:34:40.558 --> 1:34:41.600
[ominous whoosh]

1:34:50.067 --> 1:34:51.068

1:37:55.377 --> 1:37:56.962
You're a good man, Andy.

1:37:57.421 --> 1:37:59.632
You're just really unlucky.

1:37:59.965 --> 1:38:05.304
[scuffling sounds]

1:38:05.596 --> 1:38:08.682
[tense music continues]

1:38:20.277 --> 1:38:21.278
You're right.

1:38:22.279 --> 1:38:23.572
He really does love you.

1:38:48.264 --> 1:38:51.642
[struggling sounds]

1:39:12.663 --> 1:39:14.456
[coughing]

1:39:16.375 --> 1:39:18.627
Let, let... let me go!

1:39:22.089 --> 1:39:24.133
You have proven
yourself a true love.

1:39:24.216 --> 1:39:25.801
[buzzing continues]

1:39:32.766 --> 1:39:35.895
She can now move on to love,
as her Sisterhood directs.

1:39:37.062 --> 1:39:38.314
Without losing you.

1:39:40.482 --> 1:39:42.193
Why, why are you doing this?

1:39:44.486 --> 1:39:45.571
I know it seems

1:39:46.322 --> 1:39:47.323
barbaric.

1:39:49.700 --> 1:39:51.035
But we have our ways.

1:39:51.368 --> 1:39:53.078
And they have
served us this far.

1:39:54.788 --> 1:39:56.874
Who am I to
disagree with them now?

1:39:59.084 --> 1:40:00.252
What are you in, a cult?

[slap]

1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:06.884
A cult has children
playing at a religion.

1:40:09.178 --> 1:40:11.472
We have the power
that keeps the world turning.

1:40:13.933 --> 1:40:15.059
You're insane.

1:40:18.854 --> 1:40:21.524
Linda, can't you
see how crazy she is?

1:40:22.066 --> 1:40:23.067
No.

1:40:23.943 --> 1:40:24.944
Andy.

1:40:25.694 --> 1:40:26.695
She's not.

1:40:27.613 --> 1:40:30.491
The Sisterhood have been
shaping things for millenniums.

1:40:30.783 --> 1:40:31.784
For the better.

1:40:32.117 --> 1:40:34.370
Despite men's worst efforts.

1:40:35.454 --> 1:40:36.622
Don't you understand?

1:40:37.873 --> 1:40:38.999
I love you.

1:40:42.545 --> 1:40:43.629
I love you, too.

1:40:45.673 --> 1:40:46.674
Then let me go.

1:40:47.550 --> 1:40:48.551
She cannot.

1:40:52.972 --> 1:40:54.098
This is her test.

There we go.

1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:00.521
[ominous flash]

1:41:00.604 --> 1:41:02.815
It's clear she's
been bred to be alluring.

1:41:02.898 --> 1:41:04.942
So sexual desire is guaranteed.

1:41:06.986 --> 1:41:08.529
Thank you, Grandmother.

1:41:09.196 --> 1:41:10.698
You honor our ceremony.

[slow music]

1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:25.629
I wish Connie could
be here to participate.

1:41:28.424 --> 1:41:29.800
But she's tending to Dad.

1:41:31.093 --> 1:41:32.511
Somebody got a little

1:41:32.845 --> 1:41:33.888
over-eager.

[music continues]

1:41:41.896 --> 1:41:44.773
Our Linda's about to be
offered an extreme honor.

I'm sorry to hear
about your accident.

1:42:05.753 --> 1:42:06.837
You appear

1:42:07.546 --> 1:42:09.798
relatively unscathed.

1:42:11.842 --> 1:42:12.885
How is your loved one?

1:42:14.220 --> 1:42:15.221
Andy?

1:42:15.554 --> 1:42:17.765
He's fine.
I'm sorry, who are you?

1:42:19.767 --> 1:42:20.768
How rude of me.

1:42:22.728 --> 1:42:24.104
I'm your Regional Mother.

1:42:25.189 --> 1:42:26.607
I come with commands.

1:42:30.069 --> 1:42:31.862
Well, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:42:33.864 --> 1:42:34.865
Ah, yet.

1:42:36.784 --> 1:42:37.785
Good.

1:42:40.037 --> 1:42:41.413
Please, forgive me, Mother.

1:42:42.748 --> 1:42:44.667
I will be testing you
in the months to come.

1:42:46.168 --> 1:42:47.628
Expect many a test.

1:42:50.589 --> 1:42:51.590
First.

1:42:52.132 --> 1:42:54.552
Prove your love for this, Andy.

1:42:58.138 --> 1:42:59.139
That's it?

1:42:59.890 --> 1:43:00.891
We'll see.

1:43:02.268 --> 1:43:03.352
[ominous whoosh]

1:43:04.937 --> 1:43:06.981
I was convinced
that she loved you.

1:43:08.899 --> 1:43:09.900
But did you love her?

1:43:10.359 --> 1:43:11.360
[ominous flash]

1:43:12.027 --> 1:43:13.028
All I see

1:43:13.445 --> 1:43:14.738
is newly-wed passion.

1:43:15.823 --> 1:43:16.866
Passion fades.

1:43:18.409 --> 1:43:20.035
Will your love be
true without that?

1:43:22.872 --> 1:43:24.999
Well, if I had
more time, I'm sure--

1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:26.041
But you do not!

1:43:30.671 --> 1:43:32.590
Normally, you would
have had plenty of time.

1:43:33.090 --> 1:43:34.383
And there'd be no question.

1:43:35.801 --> 1:43:39.054
But this opportunity has come
with an escalated deadline.

1:43:43.184 --> 1:43:44.727
Well, what... what do I do?

To prove your love was true

1:44:05.539 --> 1:44:08.125
we had to apply
a little, herbal knowledge.

To remove libido
from the equation.

1:44:51.585 --> 1:44:52.711
You have been tested.

1:44:53.295 --> 1:44:54.880
And you have been found worthy

1:44:54.964 --> 1:44:57.550
of a leadership position
within the Sisterhood.

1:45:02.596 --> 1:45:03.597
But first.

1:45:04.390 --> 1:45:06.851
One more test.

1:45:10.145 --> 1:45:11.814
What... what is this?

1:45:14.108 --> 1:45:17.027
I suspect our Linda
could reach full Mother status.

1:45:17.820 --> 1:45:19.947
And even become a Divine Mother.

1:45:21.574 --> 1:45:22.575
But first.

1:45:22.700 --> 1:45:25.035
You must sever
ties with your old life.

1:45:25.244 --> 1:45:28.330
[music continues]

1:45:31.667 --> 1:45:33.085
The choice is yours.

1:45:34.712 --> 1:45:36.463
Will you rise
within the Sisterhood?

1:45:36.797 --> 1:45:37.882
Leave her alone!

1:45:40.593 --> 1:45:42.261
Do not worry about Linda.

1:45:43.387 --> 1:45:44.388
Unlike you men

1:45:44.763 --> 1:45:46.390
we are not wholly cruel.

1:45:51.061 --> 1:45:54.148
Linda will move on to
marry a future US president.

1:45:55.816 --> 1:45:56.859
She'll be happy.

1:45:57.067 --> 1:45:58.861
Furthering the
Sisterhood's goals.

1:46:00.654 --> 1:46:04.658
And will undoubtedly bear many
genetically superior children.

1:46:11.832 --> 1:46:12.875
I don't understand.

1:46:12.958 --> 1:46:15.586
There have been,
others that have had

1:46:16.295 --> 1:46:18.756
partnerships,
marriages even, within

1:46:19.173 --> 1:46:21.008
-the Sisterhood as well.
-Not leaders.

1:46:25.012 --> 1:46:26.972
This test is for leaders only.

1:46:28.557 --> 1:46:30.142
You know our ways are ancient.

1:46:30.559 --> 1:46:31.602
And our ways work.

1:46:32.603 --> 1:46:34.438
Mercy was given
once to a leader.

1:46:35.397 --> 1:46:37.441
And we're still fighting
to regain the Middle East.

1:46:41.153 --> 1:46:42.154
So as a leader

1:46:42.821 --> 1:46:45.074
you may only
marry into the Sisterhood.

1:46:47.368 --> 1:46:48.619
It's time for your decision.

1:46:53.749 --> 1:46:56.210
Will you join the upper
echelon of the Sisterhood?

1:46:58.462 --> 1:47:00.381
Or will you
remain one of the herd?

1:47:04.552 --> 1:47:05.553

1:47:06.053 --> 1:47:08.430
Please don't.
I love you, please.

you to come with me

and personally
identify the body.

Your involvement on
Donahue's PR staff and exit

1:48:03.944 --> 1:48:05.237
does give me some concern.

1:48:05.779 --> 1:48:06.947
I get the job done.

1:48:07.698 --> 1:48:09.366
For the right... man.

with me till the end?

That is the plan.

1:48:36.685 --> 1:48:37.811
This is a big decision.

you were going to ask.
