01:15.842 --> 01:19.187
Okay, I'm going to ask you
to take a deep breath in.

01:21.381 --> 01:23.115
And you can let it go.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.358
Should I do it again?

01:28.689 --> 01:30.032
No, one is good.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.590
<i>...upset about?
Apparently...</i>

01:31.692 --> 01:33.535
...we had this fundraiser...

01:33.727 --> 01:36.362
...and I brought cupcakes,
she brought cake pops.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.531
And she's like,
"That's too similar."

01:38.532 --> 01:40.534
I'm like,
"No, a cupcake is a cupcake.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.935
A cake pop is cake
with a stick in it."

01:42.936 --> 01:46.439
Cynthia? I'm going to ask you
to scooch down the table...

01:46.440 --> 01:48.545
Mmm-hmm.
...and turn over, please.

01:49.076 --> 01:53.081
We are grown women and we're
fighting about cake pops.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.224
Let's get over it already!
But the real issue is...

01:56.450 --> 01:58.657
...her daughter Alicia
is a very nice girl,

01:58.785 --> 02:00.958
but not very smart,
whereas my daughter...

02:05.792 --> 02:08.294
Hey, Eva.
Nice to see you.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.405
Hey.
Come on up.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.741
How's everything?

02:17.904 --> 02:18.974
Great.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.583
Excuse me.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.146
Hey, Mom.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.149
Where are you going?

02:28.815 --> 02:30.516
To a party with Sarah and Will,

02:30.517 --> 02:32.258
so they don't have to be alone.

02:32.619 --> 02:33.620
Want to come?

02:33.820 --> 02:35.163
Why?

02:35.822 --> 02:38.598
Because you're leaving soon,
and I want to be with you.

02:38.925 --> 02:41.337
I'm good, thanks.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.168
Have fun.
Thanks, honey.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.343
<i>She's driving us totally crazy.</i>

02:49.336 --> 02:50.610
We can't find anything.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.944
She puts things in
the weirdest places.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.278
Like, if I leave my
bracelet in the kitchen,

02:55.442 --> 02:57.513
she'll put it in
a kitchen drawer!

02:57.778 --> 02:59.280
Why can't you just do it?

02:59.513 --> 03:02.016
I always do it. I fired the gardener.
It's not fair.

03:02.282 --> 03:04.193
We want to fire her,
and he won't do it.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.521
It's not hard for you. Why
does it have to be fair?

03:07.621 --> 03:08.793
You should do it because
it's hard for you.

03:08.955 --> 03:10.127
Oh, please.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.200
You're a grownup.
You can fire a maid.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.859
That's the definition
of maturity?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.862
Firing your friggin' maid?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.540
Sarah, is this
color good on me?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.145
You look good.
You look pretty.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.712
That's good.
That's a nice look.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.713
Whose party is this, anyway?

03:28.975 --> 03:32.650
He's a book editor and she's an
interior designer. They know everybody.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.881
Maybe some single men are here.
No.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.150
Oh, shit, I see a patient.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.057
Oh, will you show me?

03:39.319 --> 03:40.553
Show me who.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.115
Come on, introduce me.
Stop looking. No.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.566
God, you're such a wet blanket.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.895
Oh, lookit! There's that
lady from my gym. What is...

03:48.228 --> 03:49.571
Okay, bye.
Bye.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.404
What is her name?

03:52.899 --> 03:54.242
Oh, it's Hilary.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.741
Hilary? Hilary!

03:57.237 --> 03:58.409
Eva! Hi.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.242
It's so weird to see you here.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.687
Eva, this is Marianne.
Marianne, Eva.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.685
How are you? Good.
Nice to meet you.

04:05.912 --> 04:06.913
Nice to meet you.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.091
Eva is an incredible,
incredible masseuse.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.091
Wonderful.
Thank you very much.

04:12.352 --> 04:15.697
Excuse me a second. I have,
I have to find a bathroom.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.769
That was abrupt.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.931
Oh, my goodness! Look at
those shoes and that outfit.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.541
With the purse?
It looks so nice.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.714
Thank you. I should
bring you everywhere.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.280
I love your outfit, too. Oh.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.812
So you're a masseuse?

04:33.940 --> 04:35.112
I am, yeah.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.375
Yeah?

04:36.376 --> 04:37.719
And what is it you do?

04:37.944 --> 04:38.945
I'm a poet.

04:39.212 --> 04:40.885
Oh. And I'm a dreamer.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.115
No, really.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.618
You're really a poet?

04:44.751 --> 04:45.786
I am.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.462
You do it for a living?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.291
I do.
Wow!

04:49.790 --> 04:52.794
You do, I don't. You're
a poet, now I know it.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.298
Good one.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.403
Feel free to steal it.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.804
Can I give that to you?
Thank you.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.767
Guess what?

05:01.768 --> 05:03.679
What? I think I just
got a new client.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.313
Yeah? Where?

05:05.672 --> 05:07.345
Ah, right there.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.984
She looks clean.

05:09.409 --> 05:12.253
She's really nice and funny,
she's got great taste.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.322
And very attractive.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.416
I bet you think all the
women here are attractive.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.818
Pretty much.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.494
Hold this. There's not one man
at this party I'm attracted to.

05:22.756 --> 05:23.757
Will.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.830
Hey! Jason!

05:26.092 --> 05:27.332
This is Albert.
Hi.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.096
How's it going?
How are you? Hi.

05:29.830 --> 05:34.677
So, this is a nice party. Got all
the nice white balls hanging down.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.539
Eva was just telling
me that there are

05:37.671 --> 05:39.673
no men at the party
she's attracted to.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.041
Okay.

05:41.274 --> 05:45.110
I don't know why you would
make that announcement, but...

05:45.111 --> 05:46.181
Is that unusual?

05:46.513 --> 05:49.357
No, actually, it's not unusual.
No offense.

05:49.616 --> 05:52.961
No, that's okay. There's no one
here I'm attracted to, either.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.024
Yeah, it's kind of
an ugly crowd, really.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.695
Jason, you have a kid
in college, right?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.371
Two. Yeah.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.962
I have one leaving in the fall.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.033
I do, too!

06:04.698 --> 06:06.371
That's all I have.
Me, too.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.147
Come on. Your kids are supposed to go away.
That's healthy.

06:10.470 --> 06:11.813
No. Shut up.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.049
Yeah, shut up.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.721
Do the guys get boners? No.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.982
Haven't we been over this? Yes.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.161
I get so nervous with massages.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.228
I'm afraid I'm
going to get a boner.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.160
You are? Absolutely. Absolutely.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.493
Do they hit on you?

06:30.724 --> 06:33.325
Okay, you're starting
to depress me.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.738
No, they don't hit on me.
They don't get boners, either.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.900
I do have one guy who has like a hundred
stairs going up to his house...

06:40.000 --> 06:43.413
...and he never helps me
carry my massage table.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.080
Did you ever ask him to?

06:45.338 --> 06:47.181
She shouldn't have to!
No, I shouldn't have to!

06:47.407 --> 06:49.409
Bye, guys.
Thank you. Love you.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.277
Bye, honey!

07:24.945 --> 07:26.424
Bye, Eva!
Thanks for the ride.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.956
You're welcome, Chloe.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.291
Oh, Maddy Price!

07:30.617 --> 07:31.721
You littered, honey.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.454
What did you say?

07:33.720 --> 07:36.963
I said, pick up your trash.
You're not British.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.232
What a bitch.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.319
Come on in.
Thank you.

07:58.578 --> 08:00.080
Nice to see you.
You, too.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.988
You can just put your table
clown there if you want.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.152
Would you mind
taking your shoes off?

08:07.153 --> 08:08.598
Not at all.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.632
Thank you.
And your socks, too.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.027
Do you want some iced tea?

08:15.028 --> 08:16.974
That sounds good.
Thank you.

08:17.263 --> 08:19.265
I'm so happy you called.

08:19.466 --> 08:23.141
Most people usually just
take my card to be polite.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.170
Well, I'm not polite.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.310
Oh, my, isn't this nice!

08:30.643 --> 08:31.644
Wow.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.153
Thank you!

08:35.482 --> 08:37.282
Just make yourself
at home, look around.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.820
I'm going to go change.

08:40.787 --> 08:45.133
Everything is so pretty!
Can I live here?

08:46.993 --> 08:49.496
That tea's kind
of fabulous, too.

08:57.971 --> 09:01.680
I'm dating this guy.
He has no sense of humor.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.082
That can be a dealbreaker.

09:03.309 --> 09:05.550
I don't know what to
do... he's very sweet.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.485
Sweet can be good.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.555
Maybe you can find someone
else to tell you jokes.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.396
Are you married?

09:14.654 --> 09:17.396
Divorced. Ten years.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.834
Are you still friends?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.733
No, not really.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.066
We share a daughter,
but other than that...

09:25.398 --> 09:29.403
...it's hard to believe that I
ever had a laugh with that man...

09:29.736 --> 09:32.580
...let alone
create a child.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.752
I know what you mean about your ex.
We had zero in common.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.684
I don't know how lever had a
real conversation with him.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.190
It's crazy, right?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.129
I'd like to call you pretty
soon if it's all right.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.597
My right shoulder
is still very tight.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.523
You should ice it tonight.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.525
And drink plenty of water.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.860
It's important
to stay hydrated.

09:54.861 --> 09:58.866
Of course. Hey, do you want some chervil?
I'm drowning in it.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.200
Sure.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.106
I'll just give
you what I've cut.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.113
I don't have anything
to put it in, but...

10:05.438 --> 10:07.782
Oh, that's ideal.
Thank you.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.785
Lovely. Thank you.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.784
Thank you so much.

10:13.379 --> 10:16.053
What is chervil? She said
she was drowning in it.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.382
It's a herb.

10:17.383 --> 10:18.794
A what? <i>An herb.</i>

10:19.052 --> 10:20.224
How long have you known me?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.228
I can't understand
a damn thing you say.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.456
Oh, my God.

10:23.723 --> 10:27.466
Everything in that house was gorgeous.
I wanted everything.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.900
She has no cellulite!

10:30.096 --> 10:31.163
How can that be?

10:31.164 --> 10:32.165
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

10:32.398 --> 10:33.399
Nothing.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.739
Will told me some guy you met
at the party wants your number.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.313
<i>Jason's friend, I think.</i>

10:38.571 --> 10:42.986
That's so funny. We both said we
weren't attracted to each other.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.578
I don't know what to do.
He's kind of fat.

10:46.579 --> 10:47.580
He is?

10:47.847 --> 10:48.917
He's got this big belly.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.322
<i>Well, you've got
nothing to lose.</i>

10:51.651 --> 10:54.860
No, but he does.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.102
Your light came on.
You got a patient.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.997
<i>Better get a move on.</i>

11:00.260 --> 11:01.860
What happens if you
never go out there?

11:01.861 --> 11:03.772
Do they...

11:04.330 --> 11:05.832
Was that inappropriate?

11:06.099 --> 11:07.134
Bye.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.346
I'm sorry about this. I swear to
God I made a dinner reservation.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.174
No, it's okay.
It's fine.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.785
What about you?
What do you do?

11:19.012 --> 11:22.016
I work at the American
Library of Cultural History.

11:22.282 --> 11:25.456
The what? Exactly. It's kind
of a television library.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.559
Do you watch a lot of TV?

11:27.687 --> 11:29.462
No, it's television history.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.192
What's on now, I have no clue.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.863
I tried to watch one of those
<i>Housewives of Idiot Town...</i>

11:36.196 --> 11:41.202
...but I got so depressed, I thought
I was going to jump off a building.

11:41.534 --> 11:45.038
I know what you mean. I tried to
watch one with my daughter...

11:45.305 --> 11:47.717
...and I could not believe
what I was watching!

11:47.974 --> 11:52.821
No brains, and the fake
cheekbones and fake boobs.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.556
Do you like fake boobs?

11:56.716 --> 11:59.060
No. I like real boobs.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.896
I have real boobs.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.603
That's working out for us then.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.240
How long have
you been divorced?

12:13.399 --> 12:14.901
About four years.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.574
Was it mutual?

12:17.904 --> 12:19.406
Not really. No.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.409
Can I have her number?

12:23.509 --> 12:24.852
Of course.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.921
Imagine the time
that would save.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.680
We should all put
a sign on our necks

12:28.681 --> 12:31.457
with what's wrong with us.
Get it all out there.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.856
Good idea. What
would your sign say?

12:34.254 --> 12:37.258
I don't know. I'm a slob.
I have ear hair.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.763
There are things
to get rid of that.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.437
Researched, taken care of.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.540
So you're a slob, huh?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.933
Not like a dirty hoarder slob.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.106
What kind?

12:49.235 --> 12:50.441
A normal disorganized one.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.204
Does your daughter
live with you?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.206
Half the time.

12:53.439 --> 12:58.286
It aggravates her sometimes. She and
her mother are very, very neat.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.955
As a matter of fact,
their favorite store...

13:02.215 --> 13:04.456
...I don't know,
it's... it's the store

13:04.584 --> 13:06.791
with all the empty
boxes and storage.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.396
The Container Store?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.294
Yes. The Container Store.

13:10.556 --> 13:14.629
The store that sells crap you can put
your crap in so you can buy more crap.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.567
I love that store!
I love crap.

13:16.796 --> 13:21.472
So did my ex-wife, and she puts it in
lovely, flowery and expensive boxes.

13:21.801 --> 13:26.307
You should know, they have things
in sort of manly designs there.

13:26.572 --> 13:27.642
Manly designs?

13:27.907 --> 13:31.480
Yeah, like browns,
and little cowboy designs.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.980
Little cowboys.

13:34.304 --> 13:36.248
I mean, come on. It's hard
to live with somebody,

13:36.249 --> 13:39.484
don't you think?
People's habits are...

13:39.485 --> 13:41.988
Okay, listen to this.
I like guacamole.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.667
But I don't like the onions in
guacamole, so I take a chip...

13:45.992 --> 13:47.994
...and swirl it
around and separate

13:48.094 --> 13:49.928
the onions from
the guacamole...

13:49.929 --> 13:53.001
...so I can eat it. Now,
that drove her bananas.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.609
It sounds pretty harmless.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.838
I thought so, but by the end of
our marriage, it made her gag.

13:58.104 --> 13:59.777
That's not nice.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.519
You have...

14:05.611 --> 14:06.954
...lovely hands.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.126
I thought, as a masseuse,
you'd have big,

14:09.282 --> 14:11.450
muscular hands,
but they're very lovely.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.452
Thank you.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.624
You have nice hands, too.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.027
Thank you.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.027
Kind of like paddles.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.870
Did they just turn
the music louder?

14:26.299 --> 14:29.041
No, I think you just got older.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.308
Excuse me! Do you mind turning
down the music a little?

14:36.309 --> 14:37.583
I'm old.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.387
No, I'm sorry.

14:40.213 --> 14:44.389
No, you're sorry I'm old or that
you won't turn the music down?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.560
I'm not allowed to
change it, ma'am.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.565
He's so nice!

14:50.823 --> 14:52.894
I find I don't
like younger people.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.193
Eh?

14:56.562 --> 14:58.564
I'm sorry, I picked
the wrong restaurant.

14:58.831 --> 15:01.243
I'm having a great time.
This is delicious.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.907
I can't hear what
you're saying, but...

15:04.170 --> 15:06.343
That's probably why you're
having a great time.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.182
What is this, tomatoes?

15:11.411 --> 15:13.254
Tomatoes?
It's watermelon.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.084
That's croutons next to it.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.354
Doesn't that
defeat the purpose?

15:21.754 --> 15:25.429
It's nonfat yogurt, not ice cream.
You can put stuff on it.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.527
That looks good, man.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.437
What? What?

15:29.695 --> 15:31.197
People tasting?

15:31.297 --> 15:32.937
Take a chance.
Put something in your bowl.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.703
You're not buying a house.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.103
He's happy.

15:38.037 --> 15:39.380
I know. Give me this.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.887
They have to test the flavors,
there's millions of them.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.613
Very Berry Sorbet, and...

15:46.946 --> 15:48.789
This is my daughter.

15:49.115 --> 15:52.892
<i>Wowie kazowie!</i>
She's stunning! Lucky you.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.121
She looks like her
mother, thank God.

15:55.955 --> 15:56.956
Here's mine.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.629
Right there.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.234
She's beautiful.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.803
You got any money?

16:02.628 --> 16:03.732
I'm kidding.

16:03.896 --> 16:04.966
Oh, my God.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.409
I had such a good time.
That was really fun.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.578
I thought so, too.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.989
I'm not sure.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.321
Okay.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.494
I mean...

16:30.990 --> 16:32.663
...I mean, maybe.

16:33.593 --> 16:34.936
I understand.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.169
It's just... I'm not sure.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.841
I get it.
I'm not deaf.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.142
I'm a little deaf in...

16:46.672 --> 16:48.174
Thank you very much.

16:49.775 --> 16:50.845
I like your paddles.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.158
I like your ass.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.526
My God.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.454
Well, thank you.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.031
Good night.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.031
Hi!

17:13.132 --> 17:14.474
Hi.
Hi.

17:14.867 --> 17:15.902
How was it?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.036
Fine.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.549
I mean, if he hooks up with someone
else, I'll feel like an idiot.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.377
So don't do it.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.510
What are you talking about?

17:25.511 --> 17:26.546
Nothing.

17:26.979 --> 17:30.222
I can't decide if I should
sleep with Chris or not.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.656
I don't want to do
something I'll regret...

17:32.885 --> 17:36.389
...but I also really like him,
so I don't know what to do.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.563
And you're a virgin?

17:39.825 --> 17:41.498
Yeah.
Don't answer that!

17:43.729 --> 17:48.075
Here's what I say. You can't live
in fear of making a mistake.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.744
If you want to do it, do it.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.909
Mom.
What?

17:52.171 --> 17:53.582
Stay out of it.

17:53.839 --> 17:55.580
Ellen, honey, she asked me.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.080
She did?

17:57.343 --> 17:58.686
Right, Chloe? No?

18:00.680 --> 18:01.750
My bad.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.420
Quiet.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.591
<i>Ellen, I forgot to ask...</i>

18:07.853 --> 18:10.288
...what happened
to Maddy Price?

18:10.289 --> 18:12.599
She was so rude to
me the other day!

18:12.858 --> 18:16.127
She had a threesome with
Sage Berger and Brendon Weiss...

18:16.128 --> 18:17.539
she thinks she's Taylor Momsen.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.030
Don't tell my mom!

18:19.031 --> 18:20.874
She can tell me stuff.
You never do.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.444
Wait a minute.
They had a threesome?

18:23.703 --> 18:25.546
Forget it, Mom.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.782
What is happening?

18:29.442 --> 18:30.785
Is everybody doing it?

18:31.043 --> 18:32.283
Mom, shut up!

18:33.212 --> 18:34.213
Come out!

18:36.048 --> 18:37.459
You look beautiful!

18:39.452 --> 18:40.954
Look at you two.

18:42.221 --> 18:43.393
Come on!

18:44.123 --> 18:46.125
We're not buying
the same dress, Mom!

18:46.225 --> 18:48.059
We won't wear it
at the same time.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.061
But you look stupid.

18:49.228 --> 18:50.229
I think I look good.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.397
You're so lumpy!

18:52.965 --> 18:54.103
I'd wear that if I could.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.405
Thank you.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.637
No, you wouldn't.
Mom, you look crazy.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.983
You are not the only attractive
girl in this family, Chloe.

19:02.241 --> 19:05.154
Why can't you dress like Ellen's mom?
She looks normal.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.156
So what happened
with not-so-funny guy?

19:16.656 --> 19:17.922
It didn't work out.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.596
Oh.
No, it's fine.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.162
What about you?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.335
Do you have a boyfriend?

19:27.166 --> 19:29.510
I had a very good first
date over the weekend.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.613
Oh, how nice!
What's he like?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.012
Funny.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.686
We really never
stopped talking.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.857
It was like we were
old friends already.

19:43.115 --> 19:46.119
Be careful with that, 'cause
it could kill the chemistry.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.025
No, no.
In a good way.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.699
Really. I mean, it was just...
it was very flirtatious.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.335
I didn't find him
attractive at first,

19:55.461 --> 19:57.805
because he's not handsome
in the typical way.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.809
But, um...

20:00.866 --> 20:05.212
...I don't know... now I
find him kind of... sexy.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.072
Hi.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.742
Did I get the day wrong?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.502
No. Why?

20:37.169 --> 20:38.842
Because you're wearing pajamas?

20:39.071 --> 20:42.416
It's just brunch. It's Sunday.
I like to be comfortable.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.688
Oh, good. Okay.
Come on in.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.251
I got us that.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.421
I'll make us some mimosas.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.755
This is nice.
Thank you.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.095
You carry a purse?

20:58.924 --> 21:00.870
No, that's my daughter Tess's.

21:01.761 --> 21:05.766
It was outrageously expensive, but
it was her 18th birthday, so...

21:08.267 --> 21:10.611
Oh, my God! Bagels!

21:11.270 --> 21:13.614
I love bread.
I really love it.

21:15.374 --> 21:18.287
So, what's she like?
Your daughter.

21:18.611 --> 21:22.115
She's very sophisticated... as
you can tell by the pocketbook.

21:22.381 --> 21:23.724
"Pocketbook".

21:24.283 --> 21:28.129
She's smart, lovely and funny,
and she's moving to New York.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.064
Very far away.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.734
It is far.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.611
She's going to Parsons
School of Design. Oh!

21:33.793 --> 21:34.965
I'm very proud of her.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.300
I bet. I would be.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.939
But part of me thinks
that I shouldn't let her go.

21:39.064 --> 21:42.000
She's 18 and this is
a great opportunity...

21:42.001 --> 21:44.969
...but if something
happens to her...

21:44.970 --> 21:48.907
...while she's in New York,
I will never forgive myself.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.909
Come on. But I know
what you mean.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.912
This going away
to college thing.

21:53.145 --> 21:57.148
We just send them off? And not
know where they are all the time?

21:57.149 --> 21:59.151
Aside from the fact
that I don't know

21:59.251 --> 22:01.322
what my life will be
like when she's gone.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.596
And Ellen doesn't
want her dad and me

22:03.756 --> 22:05.497
to take her there.
We take her...

22:05.758 --> 22:08.102
...to the airport here,
but don't fly with her.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.861
That would kill me...
just put her on the plane?

22:09.862 --> 22:11.637
Heartbreaking.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.437
We're going to have
to develop hobbies.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.011
I guess so.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.510
I already have one,
'cause I knit.

22:19.839 --> 22:23.184
So I'll just spend the rest of my
life knitting. That's my plan.

22:23.442 --> 22:25.786
That's funny because...
actually, I weave.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.012
Like baskets?

22:27.279 --> 22:29.190
Yeah, I do it in the garage.
Really!

22:29.448 --> 22:30.515
No.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.027
Why would you think I'd weave?

22:34.286 --> 22:37.199
I thought you were...
I didn't want to insult you.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.299
I'm kind of glad you don't weave.
Me, too.

22:41.026 --> 22:45.031
I've been picturing what it's going
to be like for her not to be here.

22:45.297 --> 22:48.642
Even though she's only here half
the time, it'll be very different.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.177
I can see your penis.

22:51.470 --> 22:52.904
My God!

22:52.905 --> 22:54.472
Your pajama thing
is a little bit open.

22:54.473 --> 22:55.816
Shit! I'm very sorry.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.711
What did you think?

22:59.078 --> 23:02.355
I think you are very healthy.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.549
Thank you.

23:03.883 --> 23:04.884
Go change your pants.

23:04.984 --> 23:05.985
Be right back.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.891
What happened to you guys? Not
the details, just general...

23:12.224 --> 23:14.898
We were... very different.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.236
We never had sex.
Not my choice.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.511
She just had no interest in it.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.578
And I'm pretty sure
she had an affair.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.203
Which was awful,

23:25.204 --> 23:27.013
because it meant
that she did like sex,

23:27.172 --> 23:28.913
she just didn't
like it with me.

23:29.174 --> 23:30.175
You. Right.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.252
She thought my job was stupid.

23:32.511 --> 23:34.923
She thought I parented badly.
I thought she parented badly.

23:35.180 --> 23:36.853
Why are you
wrecking my backyard?

23:37.850 --> 23:39.193
You have a lot of weeds.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.353
I thought this was all good.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.526
No.

23:43.923 --> 23:47.097
We never had sex, either.
Not his choice.

23:47.359 --> 23:50.272
We were pretty out of
sync in that department.

23:51.597 --> 23:55.443
We were pretty out of sync with Ellen, too.
Oh, my God...

23:56.101 --> 23:58.775
...fought all the time
about how to parent.

24:00.539 --> 24:02.212
That's good grass
you're pulling up.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.284
I'll put it back.

24:05.878 --> 24:06.879
Jesus.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.287
Got yourself a...

24:11.116 --> 24:12.720
blister thing going on?

24:13.619 --> 24:14.791
Yeah.

24:16.956 --> 24:17.957
Are you grossed out?

24:19.558 --> 24:20.593
No.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.293
You are. Are you
freaked out by my feet?

24:22.294 --> 24:24.296
I have a little
problem with feet.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.240
Have you looked
at your own feet?

24:26.465 --> 24:27.671
I'm used to my feet.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.972
Okay, well...

24:30.302 --> 24:31.645
What's the deal?

24:32.071 --> 24:34.073
It has to do with my mother.

24:34.506 --> 24:35.507
She had feet?

24:35.741 --> 24:38.415
She had spectacular feet.

24:38.644 --> 24:39.645
Here we go.

24:39.912 --> 24:42.188
They were red and
yellow and green

24:42.314 --> 24:44.590
and purple and
swollen with veins.

24:45.751 --> 24:46.752
I get it.

24:46.919 --> 24:47.920
Don't do that.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.499
I have to. I've never
had a pedicure.

24:50.622 --> 24:53.000
I never saw the point
until this actual moment.

24:53.258 --> 24:54.862
Would you like a Band-Aid?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.598
Please!
That would be great.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.197
And maybe a bag for my foot.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.264
Stop it.

25:00.265 --> 25:03.167
Two bags. Two bags
for the old bag.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.341
I knew I shouldn't
have told you.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.339
They're naked, right?

25:07.439 --> 25:08.440
Yeah.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.184
Are you ever attracted to them?

25:10.309 --> 25:11.686
No.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.013
I'm sure they're
attracted to you.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.520
They're getting massaged.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.689
Do they ever hit on you?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.525
Sometimes, yeah.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.369
I can give you a massage
some time, if you want.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.870
I might like that.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.877
I would definitely hit on you.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.544
That might be okay.

25:42.307 --> 25:43.377
Really?

25:45.544 --> 25:46.887
Want a kiss?

25:48.547 --> 25:49.719
Yeah.

26:23.015 --> 26:26.019
You didn't actually open your
eyes at any point, did you?

26:28.253 --> 26:30.597
No. No worries.

26:31.690 --> 26:33.692
I kept my eyes closed.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.103
I figured...

26:36.762 --> 26:39.265
...if I couldn't see you,
you couldn't see me.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.769
Oh, I saw you.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.781
Oh, God.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.113
I'm tired of being funny.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.391
Me, too.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.065
But you're not funny.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.629
I'm so excited for you.
He sounds great.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.568
He is great. It was so cute...
he made a whole bruncheon.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.139
Sweet.
Yeah, it was sweet.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.308
Okay, good.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.803
We had such good sex.

27:19.138 --> 27:22.142
How fun.
I can't even imagine.

27:24.409 --> 27:25.581
What do you think?

27:27.312 --> 27:31.158
I liked how it was before. You're
going to give yourself a hernia.

27:31.416 --> 27:34.285
Okay, you guys are done.
Thanks for your help.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.987
Take your drawing
in the kitchen.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.161
You can watch TV,
but no <i>Cleveland Show.</i>

27:38.423 --> 27:39.493
Please, Mom?

27:41.493 --> 27:42.665
Okay.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.674
Jeez. Way to
put your foot down.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.604
I'm too tired to
be a good parent.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.835
Maybe because you're
always moving furniture.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.006
Hi, Cathy!
<i>Hola.</i>

27:56.008 --> 27:58.852
You have no idea. Will
refused to fire her...

27:59.111 --> 28:01.551
...so I let it go, hoping she'd get better.
But she got worse.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.693
It was like she wanted to be fired.
She did such dumb stuff.

28:04.950 --> 28:06.623
That is so interesting.

28:06.852 --> 28:10.698
So I fired her. And she started crying.
Then I started crying.

28:11.023 --> 28:14.527
Then we were hugging and...
I hired her back.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.533
Of course you did.
You're nice.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.897
Right? Some people would see
me as being compassionate

28:19.898 --> 28:21.377
or soft-hearted.

28:21.633 --> 28:22.967
Will thinks I'm a baby.

28:22.968 --> 28:25.369
He wants me to fire her again
as a learning experience!

28:25.370 --> 28:26.474
Jesus Christ!

28:26.672 --> 28:27.673
That's our relationship.

28:27.806 --> 28:29.877
Not your whole relationship.
Whatever.

28:30.099 --> 28:32.643
He's a middle child who never got
enough fried chicken at dinner

28:32.644 --> 28:34.178
and needs everything
to be fair.

28:34.179 --> 28:37.251
Miss Sarah? Where should I put this?
It was in the bathroom.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.487
Outside, with the
ping pong table.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.992
Okay. No problem.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.158
Jesus.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.061
<i>Wow.</i>

28:45.557 --> 28:47.730
I've never actually
seen wisdom teeth.

28:47.993 --> 28:49.836
You do have a lot of fillings.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.697
Are they the mercury kind?

28:52.698 --> 28:53.831
The normal kind.

28:53.832 --> 28:55.505
And a couple of crowns.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.839
Yeah. Okay, your turn.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.914
Well, I'd rather you didn't.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.584
Well, I'd rather I did.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.916
I'm going to get my glasses.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.258
Come on. Open your mouth! No.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.427
Open your mouth.
Make me.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.194
Make me.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.765
Open your mouth.
Okay.

29:19.558 --> 29:22.562
Oh, my God!
You're missing a tooth?

29:23.262 --> 29:24.935
You are!
Yes, I am.

29:25.197 --> 29:26.198
Let me see.

29:27.432 --> 29:30.276
You can't tell... it's way back there.
It doesn't matter.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.713
I need some kind of
hideous bone graft.

29:34.873 --> 29:37.114
It costs a lot of money
and I'm putting it off.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.219
My grandma Dee Dee had that.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.618
Your grandma Dee Dee.
Thank you for that. Thanks.

29:46.752 --> 29:49.553
Oh, I'm so sorry!

29:49.554 --> 29:53.297
It's okay. This is Ellen's best friend,
Chloe. This is my friend, Albert.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.797
Hi.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.908
Ellen didn't answer my texts.
I thought she was sleeping.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.634
She's at her dad's, honey.
Is everything okay?

30:01.900 --> 30:03.402
I thought we were
getting breakfast.

30:04.569 --> 30:05.912
You hungry?

30:06.138 --> 30:09.312
Let's see.
From 1975, Channel 4.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.813
Well, what time?

30:10.942 --> 30:12.148
Oh, come on.

30:12.978 --> 30:13.979
Saturday morning.

30:15.814 --> 30:19.660
<i>Woody Woodpecker, Pink Panther,
McDuff, the Talking Dog...</i>

30:19.918 --> 30:22.353
...which I didn't
like but watched anyway,

30:22.354 --> 30:24.766
<i>Monster Squad,
Land of the Lost,</i> then...

30:24.990 --> 30:28.164
<i>...Big John, Little John</i>, which was
like the movie <i>Big</i>, but weirder.

30:28.427 --> 30:29.827
That's incredible.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.466
I thought I watched
a lot of TV!

30:31.763 --> 30:33.097
I looked forward
to that lineup.

30:33.098 --> 30:35.442
What, were you
neglected as a kid?

30:35.667 --> 30:37.435
I was kind of
raised like a veal.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.848
I was put in a dark room...

30:40.172 --> 30:42.174
...fed and told
not to move.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.690
Very relaxing.

30:58.888 --> 31:01.392
...and she's like, "I
might want to get another size",

31:01.393 --> 31:03.532
but that's bullshit,
it is the right size.

31:03.795 --> 31:06.469
She's petite, but very heavy
on top, so I got a medium!

31:06.698 --> 31:08.974
But here's the thing,
I got it at Nordstrom Rack,

31:09.134 --> 31:11.469
but I put it in
a Neiman Marcus box...

31:16.541 --> 31:18.714
Oh, yeah, that's good.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.051
Don't open the door.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.891
Just pretend you
don't know I'm here...

31:25.717 --> 31:29.062
...even though you
heard me lock my car.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.228
Wow!

31:33.892 --> 31:35.565
Amazing.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.737
So what do you
do with all this?

31:38.063 --> 31:41.567
Do you really want to hear this?
Yeah. I do. What?

31:41.833 --> 31:44.837
I make sure things are
transferred to digital properly.

31:45.070 --> 31:48.074
I make sure they' re logged in properly.
I write blurbs...

31:48.340 --> 31:52.516
...so if anyone under 50 wants to
put down their phone and come in...

31:52.744 --> 31:56.055
...and watch something original
and brilliant, they can find it.

31:56.515 --> 31:57.516
Like what, for instance?

31:57.716 --> 32:00.390
<i>The Sid Caesar show.
The Jack Benny show.</i>

32:00.719 --> 32:02.027
<i>The Dean Martin show.</i>

32:02.220 --> 32:04.222
So cool.
Yeah, it is.

32:04.389 --> 32:05.891
I kind of love it.

32:07.559 --> 32:08.902
On slow days...

32:09.194 --> 32:13.370
...I can sit in my office and watch
episodes of <i>What's Happening!!</i>

32:13.565 --> 32:14.566
No, you don't.

32:14.866 --> 32:16.539
Well, if things...

32:22.073 --> 32:23.746
This is my office.

32:24.409 --> 32:26.252
That's Bob. Hey.

32:30.081 --> 32:33.284
Did you ever see <i>Flipper?</i>
Of course I did.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.289
Oh, God. It made me want a
dolphin as a pet so bad.

32:36.421 --> 32:38.255
Really? That's
a lot of work.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.297
What is that noise?

32:41.626 --> 32:44.971
Somebody watching something.
It happens occasionally.

32:47.132 --> 32:51.137
It's <i>Taxi.</i> The episode
where Alex's dog dies.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.148
Buddy or Buster or something.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.983
You hungry?
Starving.

32:57.175 --> 32:58.176
Let's get lunch.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.489
There she is!
Right on time.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.425
Hi, honey.
Hi, Dad.

33:07.419 --> 33:08.420
So, Eva...

33:08.587 --> 33:10.588
Tess. Tess, Eva.

33:10.589 --> 33:11.590
Hi. Nice to meet you.

33:11.756 --> 33:12.757
You, too.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.170
Seriously?

33:18.997 --> 33:20.203
They have great chili!

33:20.332 --> 33:21.504
I love chili.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.101
Have you ever been to Lilly's?

33:24.102 --> 33:25.172
No.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.511
It's so good.
It's around the corner.

33:28.773 --> 33:30.116
Lilly's it is.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.845
I'll be studying
fashion design.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.713
You obviously have good taste.

33:35.714 --> 33:36.847
Thank you.

33:36.848 --> 33:40.295
Eva has a daughter your age going
to college in the fall also.

33:40.952 --> 33:42.620
She's going to Sarah Lawrence.

33:42.621 --> 33:45.363
She's interested in English and history.
She loves history!

33:45.624 --> 33:47.365
I think she wants
to be a writer.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.970
Sarah Lawrence is
not what it used to be.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.207
I mean, I'm sure
it's still good.

33:55.367 --> 33:59.213
It's just gone downhill a lot in the
last few years. Some of my, um...

34:00.305 --> 34:05.152
...let's just say not-so-smart
friends just got in. I was shocked.

34:06.478 --> 34:11.223
I'm sure a lot of smart people
still go there. Oh, yeah.

34:11.483 --> 34:12.484
I know. I'm just saying.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.391
I think you should stay
home and go to school here.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.496
At least you're
honest about it.

34:17.722 --> 34:22.330
Mom acts like she's excited to be on
her own again, but I don't buy it.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.902
Why don't we take it a little easy on Mom.
She's all right.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.906
Don't judge till you
have kids of your own.

34:30.168 --> 34:31.909
Except I'm not having any.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.342
And why do you say that?

34:35.739 --> 34:37.413
I want a career.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.581
Anyway, I hate kids.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.752
Really?

34:44.181 --> 34:46.525
Right now we
have that in common.

34:48.587 --> 34:49.759
Corey?

34:50.871 --> 34:52.856
Listen, she doesn't know
what she's talking about.

34:52.857 --> 34:55.201
She's too young to
know what she wants.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.764
Dad, I'm going to go
get a coffee, okay?

34:59.931 --> 35:02.275
Bye. Thank you
for lunch.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.603
So nice to meet you.
You, too.

35:05.604 --> 35:06.639
Yeah. Great.

35:06.771 --> 35:07.938
Bye!
Bye.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.282
Be careful!

35:10.442 --> 35:12.786
She has a lot of friends.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.218
You think she has threesomes?

35:15.447 --> 35:18.215
What? Why would
you say that?

35:18.216 --> 35:21.485
I know, but apparently, it's
what they're doing these days.

35:21.486 --> 35:22.794
That's what I heard.

35:24.623 --> 35:25.789
Oh, my God.

35:25.790 --> 35:26.791
Right?

35:27.626 --> 35:29.799
I'm afraid that
window's closed.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.302
There was a window?

35:47.312 --> 35:49.314
How was the daughter?

35:49.981 --> 35:52.655
Kind of awful, actually.
A real snob.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.657
That's too bad.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.499
I wonder what your
roommate will be like?

35:59.624 --> 36:01.501
Me, too.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.931
You want me to
call her parents?

36:04.095 --> 36:05.665
No, I don't.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.672
You hungry, honey?

36:10.001 --> 36:11.844
Not really.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.673
What did you eat yesterday?

36:15.674 --> 36:17.017
I don't know.

36:17.842 --> 36:21.187
Well, think. Tell me.
I want to know what you ate.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.524
Cereal...

36:26.351 --> 36:28.194
...a banana...

36:29.854 --> 36:32.357
Where'd you get the banana?
Mom, you're crazy!

36:32.691 --> 36:33.692
What?

36:34.025 --> 36:35.698
What'd you have for lunch?

36:36.027 --> 36:37.028
Okay, bye.

36:37.295 --> 36:39.036
Where are you going?

36:48.540 --> 36:51.180
I mean, he's kind of flabby and
middle-aged, but I don't care.

36:51.309 --> 36:53.550
I'm flabby and
middle-aged.

36:54.713 --> 36:58.388
It's funny, because our
middle-agedness is...

36:59.884 --> 37:02.160
...comforting, and sexy to me.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.391
Isn't that so incredibly sad?
But sort of good, too.

37:05.724 --> 37:10.400
Yeah. I think that my ex, all he
wanted was for me to accept...

37:10.995 --> 37:13.236
...his belly and
all his quirks.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.902
In the end, I was completely
repulsed by him sexually.

37:17.569 --> 37:21.572
Kind of terrible in bed
and just very clumsy.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.574
Oh, no.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.084
Just a sec.

37:29.547 --> 37:33.393
Here. It's my last copy, but I
really want you to have it.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.886
Wow! Are you sure?

37:35.887 --> 37:37.230
Absolutely.
Oh, wow.

37:37.555 --> 37:40.399
I'm a little intimidated. I'm
not really good with poetry.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.866
Just let it wash over you.
Don't try to understand it.

37:44.062 --> 37:47.600
I won't, believe me.
God, thank you so much!

37:47.732 --> 37:50.372
I've loved our time together.
I know.

37:50.568 --> 37:53.871
Do you think it would be weird
if we hung out as friends?

37:53.872 --> 37:56.375
I would love that!
I would!

37:56.608 --> 38:00.613
I want you to try this salsa,
'cause these tomatoes are amazing.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.120
But careful! There's
a ton of onions.

38:03.381 --> 38:05.292
One of the many
upsides to my divorce.

38:05.617 --> 38:09.121
What do you mean? My ex hated
onions, so he would take a chip...

38:10.722 --> 38:14.727
...and he would put it in the
salsa and tap, tap, tap...

38:14.959 --> 38:17.661
...swirl, tap, tap, tap,
swirl, and so on,

38:17.662 --> 38:19.463
until all the onions
were pushed...

38:19.464 --> 38:21.410
...up against the side!

38:21.900 --> 38:23.743
It kind of made me sick.

38:24.569 --> 38:25.570
Mom?

38:25.737 --> 38:28.911
That's my daughter... she's not
feeling well. Be right back.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.410
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

38:31.676 --> 38:33.349
I don't feel good.

38:34.512 --> 38:36.685
I feel... Right here.
Let me see.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.187
They're swollen.

38:38.516 --> 38:42.521
Listen, will you come meet my friend?
Just for a second, please?

38:42.854 --> 38:43.924
Eva?

38:45.356 --> 38:46.528
Eva?

38:47.358 --> 38:49.861
That's so weird, she was just here.
Eva?

38:50.094 --> 38:51.937
I'm going back to bed.

38:52.197 --> 38:55.201
I love you. I love you, too.
You have bad breath.

38:56.367 --> 38:58.040
I'm sick!

38:58.369 --> 38:59.712
God!

39:03.441 --> 39:04.784
Hi.

39:05.210 --> 39:08.712
This planting I'm
admiring, it's so huge!

39:08.713 --> 39:09.714
Thank you.

39:10.048 --> 39:12.892
I wanted you to meet my
daughter Tess, but...

39:14.219 --> 39:15.562
I have to go.

39:16.721 --> 39:17.893
Okay!

39:20.058 --> 39:21.401
Yeah. Okay.

39:21.726 --> 39:22.898
Great!

39:23.394 --> 39:24.634
All right.

39:25.230 --> 39:26.800
So I'll call you and
we'll do something.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.635
Wonderful.
Thank you so much!

39:28.900 --> 39:30.902
It was so nice!

39:32.403 --> 39:33.473
Thank you so much.

39:33.638 --> 39:34.905
Have a great day.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.908
Great, great, great!

39:41.079 --> 39:42.251
Bye-bye.

39:43.348 --> 39:44.691
Are you okay?
I got it!

39:56.094 --> 39:58.438
Do you believe that?
I am not shitting you!

39:58.696 --> 40:02.439
Thai is an unbelievable coincidence.
What will you do?

40:02.700 --> 40:03.701
I don't know!

40:03.935 --> 40:07.712
Oh, shit! Your light went on.
Can you call me back, please?

40:07.939 --> 40:09.006
Hi, Mom!

40:09.007 --> 40:10.008
Hi! Did you take
your shoes off?

40:10.208 --> 40:13.052
No. Since when
do I have to?

40:13.278 --> 40:16.623
We're doing that now. It's cleaner.
And your socks, too.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.793
You are not going
to believe this.

40:21.619 --> 40:26.625
It turns out that the woman I've
been massaging is Albert's ex-wife.

40:27.225 --> 40:28.727
Weird!
So weird.

40:28.960 --> 40:32.635
I have been listening to her say the
worst things about the one guy...

40:32.897 --> 40:34.467
...I started to really,
really like.

40:34.732 --> 40:38.305
And I pictured the ex she was
talking about as this fat...

40:38.636 --> 40:40.309
...irritating slob...

40:40.571 --> 40:42.642
...and it turns
out it's Albert!

40:43.141 --> 40:44.142
Fat Albert!

40:44.409 --> 40:45.911
What? Who?

40:46.144 --> 40:48.249
It's a cartoon. A cartoon!

40:48.813 --> 40:50.486
But he's so not like that.

40:50.748 --> 40:51.749
How do you know?

40:51.983 --> 40:54.486
We had breakfast the other day.
He's sweet, funny.

40:54.752 --> 40:56.595
Yeah, you liked him, right?

40:56.821 --> 40:58.494
Totally.
Wait, what?

40:58.823 --> 41:00.996
You weren't here.
We all had breakfast.

41:01.659 --> 41:03.070
I haven't even met him.

41:03.227 --> 41:04.604
Well, you will.

41:05.830 --> 41:07.832
What did she say about him?
Oh, my God!

41:08.099 --> 41:12.102
It's like this parade of horribles!
He's disgusting.

41:12.103 --> 41:15.172
That he's like
this clown in bed.

41:15.173 --> 41:16.840
Mom! Oh, my God!

41:16.841 --> 41:18.286
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41:21.679 --> 41:24.014
I date sometimes. It's just
so hard to meet people.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.256
And I'm not
attracted to anybody.

41:26.584 --> 41:28.257
Really?
Really.

41:28.586 --> 41:33.592
And you weren't attracted to your
ex-husband? That must have been difficult.

41:34.092 --> 41:37.096
Well, I tried
really hard. I did.

41:37.595 --> 41:42.601
But he would go on so many diets,
and then he would cheat...

41:42.934 --> 41:46.279
...and then he would act
shocked when he got fatter.

41:46.938 --> 41:48.440
...the behavior
around the weight.

41:48.639 --> 41:49.640
Excuse me.

41:50.274 --> 41:52.447
Are you Marianne Hope?

41:52.643 --> 41:53.644
Yes.

41:53.778 --> 41:55.121
Oh, my God!
I told you.

41:55.313 --> 41:57.486
You are like our biggest idol.

41:57.782 --> 41:59.284
This means so much to us.

41:59.484 --> 42:01.794
She gave me a copy of <i>Beautiful
Fruit</i> when my mom died.

42:01.953 --> 42:03.455
It saved me.

42:03.821 --> 42:05.323
How wonderful.
I'm so sorry.

42:05.623 --> 42:06.624
Oh, thank you.

42:06.824 --> 42:09.634
Well, thanks very much.
Blessings.

42:10.828 --> 42:11.829
Blessings.

42:12.130 --> 42:13.131
Take care.
Blessings!

42:16.300 --> 42:18.473
It's so cool
that you saved her.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.647
But, he never got obese, right?

42:24.976 --> 42:28.822
Well, it depends on your
definition of the wor
