00:03.080 --> 00:05.010
<b>Heavens Arena.</b>

00:05.010 --> 00:10.990
<b>The 251-story, 991-meter 
building is a mecca for fighters.</b>

00:11.520 --> 00:13.530
<b>When combatants win a fight,</b>

00:14.170 --> 00:17.420
<b>they may advance by one class,</b>

00:17.420 --> 00:20.460
<b>and receive a corresponding reward.</b>

00:20.460 --> 00:22.030
<b>After reaching the 100th floor,</b>

00:22.030 --> 00:24.170
<b>you are assigned a private room.</b>

00:24.790 --> 00:26.550
<b>After reaching the 200th floor,</b>

00:26.550 --> 00:32.690
<b>you receive the right to challenge 
the strongest fighters,</b>

00:32.690 --> 00:37.010
<b>the Floor Masters, in an intense 
battle of survival.</b>

00:37.630 --> 00:40.880
<b>This is the best stage</b>

00:40.880 --> 00:42.890
<b>a warrior could ask for.</b>

02:06.900 --> 02:08.710
<b>Only one thing can protect you</b>

02:08.710 --> 02:10.520
<b>from someone who uses <i>Nen</i>.</b>

02:11.120 --> 02:14.020
<b>You must also learn to use <i>Nen</i>.</b>

02:14.580 --> 02:16.530
<b>You must use <i>Ten</i> for defense.</b>

02:17.050 --> 02:18.650
<b>Otherwise...</b>

02:24.020 --> 02:27.750
<b>Your body will be crushed.</b>

02:27.750 --> 02:32.750
<b>Awakening x And x Potential</b>

02:34.480 --> 02:35.850
<b>As the hour grows late,</b>

02:35.850 --> 02:38.590
<b>Wing's lecture has reached its climax.</b>

02:42.460 --> 02:45.010
<b>But they only have until midnight.</b>

02:45.570 --> 02:46.710
<b>Before that time,</b>

02:46.710 --> 02:50.510
<b>Gon and Killua must learn <i>Nen</i>.</b>

02:51.790 --> 02:55.520
<b><i>Nen</i> is a power that dwells 
within every person.</b>

02:56.150 --> 02:57.840
<b>However, at present,</b>

02:57.840 --> 03:01.340
<b>only a few are capable of using that power.</b>

03:01.340 --> 03:05.490
<b>Thus, they are treated as 
geniuses, leaders, psychics,</b>

03:05.490 --> 03:09.540
<b>mystics, or superhumans.</b>

03:10.380 --> 03:12.620
<b>A power that dwells within everyone...</b>

03:12.620 --> 03:13.740
<b>Yes.</b>

03:13.740 --> 03:15.040
<b>And there are two means</b>

03:15.040 --> 03:18.050
<b>by which to awaken this power.</b>

03:18.830 --> 03:21.510
<b>The deliberate way and the aggressive way.</b>

03:22.130 --> 03:24.550
<b>Zushi underwent the deliberate method.</b>

03:25.030 --> 03:28.560
<b>He was a quick learner, and he trained hard.</b>

03:28.560 --> 03:32.000
<b>So he was able to master <i>Ten</i> 
in a very short time.</b>

03:32.960 --> 03:34.620
<b>In about six months.</b>

03:35.120 --> 03:36.620
<b>That's too long...</b>

03:36.620 --> 03:38.570
<b>We need to learn <i>Ten</i>,</b>

03:38.870 --> 03:41.570
<b>and pass Hisoka's <i>Nen</i> barrier before midnight!</b>

03:42.190 --> 03:44.890
<b>Then you'll have to try the aggressive method.</b>

03:44.890 --> 03:46.580
<b>Will it be fast enough?</b>

03:47.110 --> 03:49.060
<b>That will depend on you.</b>

03:49.060 --> 03:53.860
<b>Can you learn to hold your aura within 
your body, before time runs out?</b>

03:54.540 --> 03:56.540
<b>That is the key.</b>

03:57.170 --> 04:01.060
<b>I will now direct my aura toward you.</b>

04:01.060 --> 04:03.730
<b>This is known as <i>Hatsu</i>, 
which I demonstrated earlier.</b>

04:07.250 --> 04:10.840
<b>Naturally, I will restrain myself, 
since my objective is not</b>

04:10.840 --> 04:12.730
<b>to destroy your bodies.</b>

04:13.220 --> 04:16.310
<b>However, this way is still perilous.</b>

04:16.310 --> 04:20.360
<b>In other words, I will attempt 
to shock you into awakening.</b>

04:20.900 --> 04:23.450
<b>I will give your sleeping body a jolt,</b>

04:23.450 --> 04:26.370
<b>so you can learn <i>Ten</i> more easily.</b>

04:26.830 --> 04:28.570
<b>I say that your body sleeps because</b>

04:28.570 --> 04:31.740
<b>your body's openings, 
or micropyles, are closed,</b>

04:31.740 --> 04:34.370
<b>meaning that your aura flow is stunted.</b>

04:34.920 --> 04:36.250
<b>Therefore,</b>

04:36.250 --> 04:39.860
<b>I will send my aura into your bodies,</b>

04:39.860 --> 04:42.130
<b>to open your micropyles.</b>

04:40.400 --> 04:44.880
<b>[Micropyles]
Numerous pores in the body, 
which release aura.</b>

04:47.780 --> 04:51.020
<b>Under normal circumstances,</b>

04:51.020 --> 04:53.090
<b>you would spend a long time</b>

04:53.090 --> 04:56.590
<b>meditating and discovering your own auras,</b>

04:56.590 --> 05:00.400
<b>while slowly opening those apertures.</b>

05:01.000 --> 05:04.900
<b>Even Zushi, a natural talent, 
required three months.</b>

05:07.760 --> 05:10.530
<b>However, you two could do it in a week.</b>

05:10.530 --> 05:13.160
<b>Or even sooner.</b>

05:15.160 --> 05:17.250
<b>Which is why I find it unfortunate</b>

05:17.250 --> 05:21.010
<b>that we have such little time to work with.</b>

05:21.010 --> 05:22.550
<b>I don't really get it...</b>

05:23.310 --> 05:27.050
<b>But quick and dirty is always better.</b>

05:28.200 --> 05:31.060
<b>This is a shady, highly frowned upon method.</b>

05:31.790 --> 05:34.180
<b>You will be ignoring the correct procedure.</b>

05:34.180 --> 05:35.680
<b>You could even die,</b>

05:35.680 --> 05:39.310
<b>if the person using this method 
were weak or evil.</b>

05:39.940 --> 05:44.210
<b>But you aren't weak, and you aren't evil.</b>

05:44.210 --> 05:45.030
<b>Right?</b>

05:48.730 --> 05:50.030
<b>That's why I want to know...</b>

05:50.050 --> 05:55.540
<b>Shroud   Force 
Null 
Act</b>

05:50.740 --> 05:52.040
<b>Why would you</b>

05:52.040 --> 05:55.540
<b>suddenly decide to teach us the 
true four major principles?</b>

05:56.270 --> 05:58.540
<b>Because I did not want to 
squander this opportunity.</b>

05:59.270 --> 06:01.550
<b>If you were to challenge the 200s,</b>

06:01.550 --> 06:04.800
<b>with none of this knowledge, 
you would suffer greatly.</b>

06:05.730 --> 06:09.930
<b>Up there, everyone knows 
how to manipulate <i>Nen</i>.</b>

06:11.540 --> 06:14.440
<b>And they have a special 
greeting for any newcomer</b>

06:14.440 --> 06:15.940
<b>ignorant of <i>Nen</i>,</b>

06:15.940 --> 06:17.940
<b>a <i>Nen</i> attack.</b>

06:18.650 --> 06:21.490
<b>In other words, they do what I am about to,</b>

06:21.490 --> 06:23.440
<b>but without restraint.</b>

06:23.990 --> 06:27.950
<b>They don't care, even if people die...</b>

06:30.910 --> 06:35.610
<b>Only those who survive 
are allowed to pass.</b>

06:35.610 --> 06:36.950
<b>They are the chosen.</b>

06:39.690 --> 06:42.250
<b>However, they pay a steep price.</b>

06:42.760 --> 06:45.210
<b>That's why I wanted you to be prepared.</b>

06:46.210 --> 06:49.420
<b>Now, despite my attempts to scare you,</b>

06:49.420 --> 06:52.720
<b>I have confidence that this 
will awaken your power!</b>

06:53.170 --> 06:54.910
<b>You have the potential.</b>

06:55.650 --> 06:57.220
<b>As well as the ability.</b>

06:57.680 --> 07:00.690
<b>Put your belongings down, 
take off your shirt,</b>

07:00.690 --> 07:02.840
<b>and turn your backs toward me.</b>

07:13.820 --> 07:15.610
<b><i>It's so hot!</i></b>

07:15.610 --> 07:20.460
<b><i>And I can feel pressure, even though 
Wing-san isn't touching me.</i></b>

07:21.000 --> 07:23.540
<b><i>This is it! That sensation...</i></b>

07:23.540 --> 07:27.710
<b><i>Like something invisible and slimy, 
crawling across my skin.</i></b>

07:28.860 --> 07:31.760
<b><i>Amplify this by millions of times,</i></b>

07:31.760 --> 07:34.140
<b><i>and it'd feel like my brother's <i>Nen</i> ?</i></b>

07:35.820 --> 07:37.140
<b>I'll begin.</b>

07:49.710 --> 07:53.660
<b>Every micropyle on your bodies has opened.</b>

07:55.560 --> 07:57.160
<b>Th-This is...</b>

07:58.050 --> 08:01.550
<b>That is your aura, or life energy.</b>

08:01.550 --> 08:02.960
<b>You can see it now,</b>

08:02.960 --> 08:05.920
<b>because the micropyles in your 
eyes were also opened.</b>

08:06.350 --> 08:07.740
<b>It's like smoke.</b>

08:08.240 --> 08:11.800
<b>Like steam, rising from the spout of a kettle.</b>

08:12.350 --> 08:14.800
<b>It's rushing out from every part of my body.</b>

08:15.470 --> 08:17.450
<b>It won't stop gushing out.</b>

08:18.060 --> 08:20.310
<b>Isn't that dangerous?</b>

08:20.830 --> 08:23.000
<b>This is your life energy,</b>

08:23.000 --> 08:26.520
<b>so if it continues to escape, 
you will grow tired.</b>

08:27.290 --> 08:29.040
<b>If you expend all your aura,</b>

08:29.040 --> 08:30.820
<b>you will collapse from fatigue.</b>

08:31.310 --> 08:32.570
<b>Really?</b>

08:34.790 --> 08:36.230
<b>Listen to me.</b>

08:36.230 --> 08:39.450
<b>You must concentrate on keeping 
your aura within your body.</b>

08:40.090 --> 08:41.450
<b>Close your eyes!</b>

08:44.550 --> 08:49.210
<b>Use any stance that helps you to focus.</b>

08:49.640 --> 08:54.220
<b>Then visualize your aura flowing 
like blood through your body.</b>

08:55.020 --> 08:57.720
<b>From the top of your head, 
to your right shoulder.</b>

08:58.400 --> 09:02.220
<b>To your hand, before passing through
 your legs, to the left side.</b>

09:03.600 --> 09:07.300
<b>And now visualize that flow 
beginning to ebb</b>

09:07.950 --> 09:11.980
<b>and hovering around your body.</b>

09:22.580 --> 09:25.000
<b><i>These boys are incredible.</i></b>

09:25.000 --> 09:28.420
<b><i>I didn't need to tell them that a natural stance</i></b>

09:28.420 --> 09:30.630
<b><i>would be the most effective.</i></b>

09:31.370 --> 09:34.410
<b><i>With minimal advice, they've already 
mastered the technique.</i></b>

09:36.300 --> 09:37.720
<b><i>Magnificent...</i></b>

09:38.340 --> 09:40.200
<b><i>And terrifying.</i></b>

09:42.160 --> 09:44.020
<b>Slowly open your eyes.</b>

09:44.550 --> 09:45.640
<b>How do you feel?</b>

09:46.430 --> 09:50.650
<b>I feel like I'm surrounded by some 
kind of warm mucus.</b>

09:51.150 --> 09:54.800
<b>Yeah, like I'm wearing weightless clothes.</b>

09:56.080 --> 09:58.900
<b>Continue to maintain those images.</b>

09:59.580 --> 10:02.800
<b>Once you've assimilated them, 
you'll be able to use <i>Ten</i> while asleep.</b>

10:08.860 --> 10:12.850
<b>Next, I will use hostile <i>Nen</i> against you!</b>

10:18.800 --> 10:20.910
<b>Previously, it would have</b>

10:20.910 --> 10:23.510
<b>been painful for you to stand within this.</b>

10:24.150 --> 10:25.300
<b>Yeah,</b>

10:25.300 --> 10:30.520
<b>I understand your blizzard analogy now.</b>

10:31.200 --> 10:34.950
<b>If you can fend off my <i>Nen</i>,</b>

10:34.950 --> 10:37.030
<b>you'll be able to break through his barrier!</b>

10:39.380 --> 10:40.530
<b>Here I come!</b>

11:42.280 --> 11:45.450
<b>Welcome to the 200s.</b>

11:45.450 --> 11:48.300
<b>It appears that I needn't bother 
with the traditional greeting.</b>

11:50.550 --> 11:54.860
<b>I can guess why you've come 
to Heavens Arena.</b>

11:55.330 --> 11:59.360
<b>You intended to train before challenging me...</b>

11:59.900 --> 12:04.070
<b>Yeah, but I didn't expect to find you here.</b>

12:04.620 --> 12:06.330
<b>That saves me time.</b>

12:09.040 --> 12:12.250
<b>You should avoid being overconfident 
in your ability to use <i>Ten</i>.</b>

12:13.920 --> 12:15.980
<b>There is much to learn about <i>Nen</i>.</b>

12:17.040 --> 12:18.210
<b>To be honest,</b>

12:18.560 --> 12:21.980
<b>at present, I feel no urge to fight you.</b>

12:25.740 --> 12:26.600
<b>However...</b>

12:28.370 --> 12:31.750
<b>If you manage to win a single 
match in the 200s,</b>

12:31.750 --> 12:33.480
<b>I shall accept your challenge.</b>

12:41.230 --> 12:42.310
<b>Let's go.</b>

12:43.210 --> 12:44.490
<b>Yeah.</b>

12:49.470 --> 12:50.790
<b>Newcomers?</b>

12:50.790 --> 12:52.430
<b>Looks like it.</b>

12:54.500 --> 12:57.420
<b>Seems that they can use it.</b>

12:57.420 --> 12:59.000
<b>Indeed...</b>

13:10.600 --> 13:13.140
<b>Welcome to the 200s!</b>

13:13.140 --> 13:15.600
<b>Please fill out the forms here.</b>

13:16.570 --> 13:19.300
<b>Would you like to register for a match now?</b>

13:20.840 --> 13:23.940
<b>In this class, there is a self-service system</b>

13:23.940 --> 13:27.110
<b>by which you're permitted 
ninety days of preparation.</b>

13:27.430 --> 13:31.620
<b>You may choose to fight on 
any day during that time.</b>

13:31.620 --> 13:35.120
<b>Of course, you're free to fight every day,</b>

13:35.120 --> 13:38.630
<b>and you can also wait until 
the very last day to fight.</b>

13:39.170 --> 13:40.830
<b>Once you've participated in a fight,</b>

13:40.830 --> 13:43.760
<b>you have another ninety days to prepare.</b>

13:44.110 --> 13:47.030
<b>However, if you don't fight before 
those ninety days end,</b>

13:47.030 --> 13:48.560
<b>you will be disqualified,</b>

13:48.560 --> 13:51.840
<b>and your name will be struck from all records.</b>

13:51.840 --> 13:55.930
<b>Does that mean we'll be fighting 
in this class multiple times?</b>

13:55.930 --> 13:56.940
<b>Yes,</b>

13:56.940 --> 14:00.680
<b>you need ten wins to clear this floor.</b>

14:01.220 --> 14:04.240
<b>However, if you lose four times before ten wins,</b>

14:04.240 --> 14:06.420
<b>you'll be disqualified.</b>

14:07.340 --> 14:08.410
<b>And</b>

14:08.410 --> 14:11.700
<b>if you win ten times,</b>

14:11.700 --> 14:15.540
<b>you have a chance to challenge 
the Floor Masters!</b>

14:15.840 --> 14:20.760
<b>The Floor Masters are the twenty-one 
strongest fighters here.</b>

14:20.760 --> 14:24.110
<b>Each claims one of the floors,</b>

14:24.110 --> 14:26.820
<b>from 230 to 250.</b>

14:27.490 --> 14:29.250
<b>Do you understand now?</b>

14:29.250 --> 14:31.370
<b>If you defeat a Floor Master,</b>

14:31.370 --> 14:35.510
<b>you become the new master of that floor!</b>

14:36.420 --> 14:38.160
<b>Th-That's not all!</b>

14:38.160 --> 14:40.690
<b>If you become a Floor Master,</b>

14:40.690 --> 14:43.980
<b>you earn the right to participate in</b>

14:43.980 --> 14:49.950
<b>the biennial celebration of 
combat, Battle Olympia!</b>

14:53.240 --> 14:54.450
<b>No reaction?</b>

14:55.000 --> 14:56.760
<b>Forget that.</b>

14:56.760 --> 14:58.830
<b>Is there anything special about the top floor?</b>

14:59.100 --> 15:00.770
<b>That's what you want to know?!</b>

15:00.770 --> 15:02.740
<b>The champion of Battle Olympia</b>

15:02.740 --> 15:05.090
<b>gets to live on the top floor!</b>

15:05.090 --> 15:07.360
<b>It's an incredible honor.</b>

15:08.590 --> 15:12.110
<b>A penthouse 1,000 meters above the ground...</b>

15:12.110 --> 15:13.100
<b>Don't you get it?!</b>

15:13.100 --> 15:18.050
<b>But Killua's house is 3,700 meters 
above ground, right?</b>

15:20.350 --> 15:25.720
<b>A-And the champion always

15:25.720 --> 15:27.100
<b>What do you wanna do, Gon?</b>

15:27.100 --> 15:29.580
<b>Now that I know the top floor's secret,</b>

15:29.580 --> 15:30.490
<b>I don't care anymore.</b>

15:31.440 --> 15:35.240
<b>Yeah! I just want to fight with Hisoka.</b>

15:36.590 --> 15:40.500
<b>Why are you kids even here?</b>

15:40.500 --> 15:44.160
<b>Well, then you'll need to win a fight.</b>

15:44.160 --> 15:46.500
<b>But you're gonna wait a bit first, right?</b>

15:47.210 --> 15:48.420
<b>No...</b>

15:49.920 --> 15:51.080
<b>I'm doing this!</b>

15:52.090 --> 15:56.450
<b>I have to find out how different 
these opponents are.</b>

15:59.130 --> 16:02.750
<b>I'll need you to fill out this form, as well.</b>

16:02.750 --> 16:04.020
<b>Okay!</b>

16:11.220 --> 16:12.530
<b>You want something?</b>

16:12.850 --> 16:15.030
<b>No, not really.</b>

16:15.400 --> 16:19.290
<b>We're simply in line to register for a fight.</b>

16:27.460 --> 16:28.920
<b>Oh, I get it.</b>

16:28.920 --> 16:33.170
<b>Gon, these guys want to fight 
on the day you do.</b>

16:47.020 --> 16:49.980
<b>I'm ready to go whenever.</b>

16:50.940 --> 16:52.350
<b>There you go.</b>

16:53.210 --> 16:55.990
<b>This boy has plenty of spunk.</b>

17:01.650 --> 17:05.050
<b>Then Gon-sama will be in room 2207.</b>

17:05.050 --> 17:08.600
<b>Killua-sama will be in room 2223.</b>

17:10.170 --> 17:12.720
<b>We will let you know which day your match is.</b>

17:13.620 --> 17:14.860
<b>Thanks!</b>

17:28.230 --> 17:31.340
<b>They must have gone through</b>

17:31.340 --> 17:33.780
<b>that greeting Four-Eyes mentioned.</b>

17:35.580 --> 17:37.030
<b>If we'd gone in blind,</b>

17:37.670 --> 17:39.700
<b>we could've ended up like them.</b>

17:39.700 --> 17:42.320
<b>Wow! This room is huge!</b>

17:42.320 --> 17:44.170
<b>Hey, are you listening to me?</b>

17:44.170 --> 17:46.160
<b>The bath is squeaky clean.</b>

17:46.770 --> 17:50.820
<b>Whee... I've never seen such a big bed!</b>

17:50.820 --> 17:52.050
<b>Look, Killua...</b>

17:55.090 --> 17:56.050
<b>Hey, Gon!</b>

18:00.550 --> 18:04.060
<b>Your battle has been set 
for 3 PM, March 11th!!</b>

18:04.290 --> 18:06.060
<b>What? Tomorrow?!</b>

18:06.060 --> 18:07.310
<b>That's fast.</b>

18:14.290 --> 18:16.950
<b>I probably won't be able to win tomorrow.</b>

18:17.510 --> 18:19.160
<b>But that's okay.</b>

18:19.650 --> 18:21.660
<b>I need the experience.</b>

18:24.130 --> 18:27.910
<b>I need to discover what I 
can do with this power.</b>

18:39.570 --> 18:42.390
<b>Okay, we have a thrilling match for you today.</b>

18:42.730 --> 18:45.530
<b>First, we have Gon, who managed</b>

18:45.530 --> 18:48.420
<b>to zip straight to this class!</b>

18:51.140 --> 18:52.950
<b>His opponent will be Gido,</b>

18:52.950 --> 18:57.250
<b>who currently holds a respectable 4-1 record.</b>

19:15.520 --> 19:18.220
<b><i>Listen to me, Gon-kun. Killua-kun.</i></b>

19:19.020 --> 19:22.050
<b><i>Ten is a purely defensive technique.</i></b>

19:22.050 --> 19:24.570
<b><i>You have not improved 
your offensive capabilities.</i></b>

19:24.570 --> 19:29.270
<b><i>Plus, you will still take damage 
from physical attacks.</i></b>

19:30.420 --> 19:33.310
<b><i>A highly skilled Nen opponent</i></b>

19:33.310 --> 19:35.690
<b><i>will be able to penetrate your Ten,</i></b>

19:35.960 --> 19:38.880
<b><i>and deal a lethal blow.</i></b>

19:38.880 --> 19:42.200
<b><i>So you should wait two months 
before you start fighting.</i></b>

19:42.580 --> 19:46.200
<b><i>During that time, I will 
teach you as much as I can.</i></b>

19:47.560 --> 19:49.960
<b><i>Sorry, Wing-san.</i></b>

19:50.840 --> 19:53.770
<b><i>But I'm itching to fight right now!</i></b>

20:00.640 --> 20:02.000
<b>Good grief.</b>

20:02.000 --> 20:03.970
<b>That boy is a real handful...</b>

20:04.660 --> 20:05.640
<b>And...</b>

20:06.180 --> 20:06.970
<b>Begin!</b>

20:20.800 --> 20:23.950
<b>Dancing Tops</b>

20:25.470 --> 20:28.450
<b>There they are, Gido's Dancing Tops!</b>

20:28.760 --> 20:34.210
<b>He uses numerous tops to 
attack his opponent!</b>

20:34.430 --> 20:35.760
<b>Here we go...</b>

20:36.380 --> 20:38.960
<b>Battle Waltz!</b>

20:57.070 --> 20:58.540
<b>Clean hit!</b>

20:59.120 --> 21:01.800
<b>Oh, Gon gives up a clean hit</b>

21:01.800 --> 21:04.090
<b>and one point, right off the bat!</b>

21:04.090 --> 21:05.890
<b>He's off to a rough start.</b>

21:05.890 --> 21:07.070
<b><i>Damn!</i></b>

21:07.330 --> 21:08.910
<b>I can use <i>Nen</i></b>

21:08.910 --> 21:11.580
<b>to keep these tops spinning 
for hours, as my attack.</b>

21:11.580 --> 21:13.500
<b>The attack pattern is so complex,</b>

21:13.500 --> 21:18.540
<b>even I don't know what will come next!</b>

21:20.120 --> 21:23.550
<b><i>Tops spinning into each other 
and attacking me...</i></b>

21:24.880 --> 21:29.440
<b><i>That small top deals damage 
equivalent to a hammer!</i></b>

21:31.750 --> 21:36.430
<b>Gon has begun his first battle of the 
200s class, which is filled with <i>Nen</i> users.</b>

21:36.930 --> 21:40.090
<b>The 200s class is nothing like he expected.</b>

21:41.610 --> 21:45.720
<b>Can Gon survive this predicament?</b>

21:47.880 --> 21:49.320
<b>Or not?</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:02.660
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.110
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.110
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:02.660 --> 23:03.490
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.490 --> 23:05.280
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.110 --> 23:06.570
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:06.750 --> 23:07.570
<b>It's Gon</b>

23:07.570 --> 23:08.400
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.400 --> 23:09.920
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.700 --> 23:19.580
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.920 --> 23:11.810
<b>Today, we introduce Gido!</b>

23:11.510 --> 23:15.490
<b>A Heavens Arena 200s-class 
fighter who is Gon's first 
opponent.</b>

23:11.810 --> 23:14.110
<b>He fights with <i>Nen</i>-controlled tops.</b>

23:14.110 --> 23:17.430
<b>He may even turn himself into one, and spin into you!</b>

23:15.490 --> 23:19.580
<b>An enhancer, who plays 
while he fights.</b>

23:17.430 --> 23:19.870
<b>Spin round and round...</b>

23:25.750 --> 23:28.100
<b>Next time: Fierce x And x Ferocious!</b>

23:28.100 --> 23:29.780
<b>Don't be too reckless.</b>

23:29.780 --> 23:32.220
<b>A real friend would support 
my reckless behavior.</b>

23:32.220 --> 23:34.560
<b>That's just reckless.</b>
