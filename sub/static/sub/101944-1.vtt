00:39.081 --> 00:40.875
(crowd cheering)

00:40.958 --> 00:43.043
MALE ANNOUNCER:
The rain has stopped.

00:43.127 --> 00:44.670
The excitement has really grown

00:44.754 --> 00:48.215
among this 40,000-strong
Wembley crowd.

00:48.299 --> 00:50.468
Safe to say that
every single one of them

00:50.551 --> 00:52.094
is on Henry Cooper’s side.

00:52.178 --> 00:53.679
(punches landing)

00:53.763 --> 00:55.681
MALE ANNOUNCER 2: And Cooper’s
eye is opening wider.

00:55.765 --> 00:57.558
It’s a shocking cut
above his left eye.

00:57.641 --> 01:00.478
He knows he’s got to get this
fight over with fairly quickly.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.146
Clay doesn’t like it.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.482
He pushes the referee, but the
referee’s having none of it.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.484
-Clay is mocking Cooper.
-CASSIUS: I’m over here.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.402
ANNOUNCER 2: Cooper knows.
He’s trying to get that left...

01:08.486 --> 01:09.945
-CASSIUS: I’m over here.
-...left hook now.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.322
-(bell dinging)
-Left hook. Oh, there he goes!

01:11.405 --> 01:12.990
-He just misses Clay.
-(crowd jeering)

01:13.073 --> 01:15.034
And he raises his hands
as he goes back to his corner,

01:15.117 --> 01:16.994
the crowd jeering him
all the way.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.330
My goodness, Cooper.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.457
ANGELO:
Is this a joke to you, kid?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.167
-What’d I do?
-Nothing.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.085
That’s the problem.
We had a fight plan.

01:25.169 --> 01:27.087
Plan? Angie, look at him.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.256
I’m beating the shit
out of that tomato can.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.841
Damn right he is.
Rumble, young man, rumble!

01:30.925 --> 01:32.134
-Ah!
-Ah!

01:32.218 --> 01:33.552
Listen, if you’re not
gonna keep your hands up,

01:33.636 --> 01:34.720
can you at least
finish him off?

01:34.804 --> 01:36.055
I don’t want to get
too close to him.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.807
I get any more of his blood
on my trunks,

01:37.890 --> 01:39.433
my mama ain’t never
gonna be able to get it out.

01:39.517 --> 01:42.186
Nobody gives a damn about
blood on some boxing trunks.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.687
These is my lucky trunks.

01:43.771 --> 01:44.772
Your mama’s still doing
your laundry?

01:44.855 --> 01:46.190
-(laughter)
-Shut up.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.733
Would you both
shut the fuck up?

01:47.817 --> 01:48.818
Here.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.444
Three rounds in,
and it’s not looking good

01:50.528 --> 01:52.613
-for Henry the Hammer.
-No, it is not.

01:52.696 --> 01:53.864
ANNOUNCER 2: This Wembley Park
crowd was expecting

01:53.948 --> 01:55.533
a better showing
from local lad Cooper

01:55.616 --> 01:57.493
against American upstart
Cassius Clay.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.954
They’ve been saying
the Louisville Lip’s theatrics

02:00.037 --> 02:02.081
overshadow his actual skills
in the ring.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.916
I doubt Cooper agrees
with that assessment tonight.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.376
Let’s just hope
Clay can put this bloke

02:05.459 --> 02:06.544
out of his misery soon.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.003
ANNOUNCER:
I think we may have all

02:08.087 --> 02:09.672
underestimated
Cassius Clay, Ronnie.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.091
Perhaps he is
as good as he says he is.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.175
(bell dinging)

02:13.259 --> 02:14.426
Finish him off!

02:14.510 --> 02:16.595
I’ll finish him
when I’m good and ready to.

02:16.679 --> 02:18.180

ANGELO:
Jab him! Jab him!

02:23.102 --> 02:24.770
-Push!

02:27.731 --> 02:31.151
ANGELO: Let’s go, now, Cassius.
Let’s go.

02:31.235 --> 02:32.361

ANGELO:
There you are.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.157
-ANGELO: That’s right.
-No holding, Henry.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.368
-Cooper, hang on.
-Don’t stay in too long. Move.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.245
-Move!
-Dance, Cassius. Keep moving.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.497
-Come on. -ANNOUNCER 2:
Clay is mocking Cooper.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.541
ANGELO:
There it is. There you are.

02:45.624 --> 02:46.834
Got to dance with him.
You got to dance.

02:46.917 --> 02:47.918
ANNOUNCER 2:
The crowd doesn’t like it.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.879
None of that.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.297
-Hands! Hands up!
-Come on, Henry!

02:51.380 --> 02:53.966
-What is he doing?
-I don’t know. Playing around.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.050
ANGELO:
Don’t walk this guy down.

02:55.134 --> 02:56.302
BUNDINI:
That’s how you do it.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.220
ANGELO:
Keep your eyes in the ring.

02:58.304 --> 02:59.305
Is that Elizabeth Taylor?

02:59.388 --> 03:00.848
ANNOUNCER:
Anything might happen.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.516
Keep those hands up!

03:02.600 --> 03:03.809
There you go!

03:03.893 --> 03:05.144
-Oh!
-(crowd clamoring)

03:05.227 --> 03:06.228
ANNOUNCER: That was
the end of the fourth round,

03:06.312 --> 03:07.563
and he hit him.

03:07.646 --> 03:08.647
-Get up! -So close,
before the end of the round.

03:08.731 --> 03:10.065
ANGELO:
That was lucky.

03:10.149 --> 03:11.525
Get up there, Cassius. Come on.

03:11.609 --> 03:12.902
Get up.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.778
You’re okay!
You’re okay! Come on.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.364
ANNOUNCER:
Clay took one chance too many,

03:17.448 --> 03:19.700
and he still doesn’t know
where he is.

03:19.783 --> 03:22.077
He’s still half out, Clay.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.954
MYRON:
I want you to imagine a man

03:24.038 --> 03:25.956
who, for 25 years of his life,

03:26.040 --> 03:29.043
arrived to work
every morning at 9:00.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.003
You could set your watch
by him.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.213
Then suddenly one morning,
after 25 years

03:33.297 --> 03:35.633
of punctual 9:00-in-the-morning
appearances,

03:35.716 --> 03:38.218
not only is he late but
he doesn’t look like himself.

03:38.302 --> 03:41.639
Big lump on his head,
two black eyes, bloody nose,

03:41.722 --> 03:44.725
torn lip, clothes ripped
and disheveled.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.561
His boss says, "What in
the world happened to you?"

03:47.645 --> 03:50.689
He says, "Oh, fell down
a whole flight of stairs,

03:50.773 --> 03:52.608
almost got killed."

03:52.691 --> 03:55.277
His boss says,
"So this took you an hour?"

03:55.361 --> 03:56.695
(laughter)

03:56.779 --> 03:58.781
(applause)

03:58.864 --> 04:00.950
JESS:
Jules, work with us.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.785
JULES:
The Copa has rules.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.995
Band members sit
in the bandstand.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.330
Cliff’s not dressed.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.165
You don’t even have
a chair for him.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.751
-If your guy’s a real singer...
-Real singer?

04:10.834 --> 04:13.170
...then he don’t need no guitar
player on the floor with him.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.214
My guy’s first single
was number one in America.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.882
He ain’t had any hits in here.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.300
I never should’ve booked him.

04:18.384 --> 04:20.469
We could’ve had Mark Wilson
in this slot.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.513
Who? The magician?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.431
From The Magical Land
of Allakazam?

04:24.515 --> 04:26.058
(chuckles)
I love that show, man.

04:26.141 --> 04:29.353
See? Even that guy knows,
and he looks like an idiot.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.438
-Fuck you, man.
-MYRON: My dear good friends,

04:31.522 --> 04:32.898
you’ve been
a wonderful audience.

04:32.982 --> 04:34.525
Thank you very much,
and good night.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.943
-JULES: So?
-Thank you.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.153
Should I tell Myron
to do an encore?

04:38.237 --> 04:40.781
He’s the one
these people paid to see.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.700
JESS:
Shh.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.535
-Sam. -MAN: Give it up
for Myron Cohen,

04:44.618 --> 04:45.828
-ladies and gentlemen.
-(applause)

04:45.911 --> 04:46.954
Myron Cohen.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.456
-All right, fine. Fine.
-Fine.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.878
-MAN: Next up... -Better not
fuck up my arrangements.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.922
...we have a young man
coming to the Copacabana

04:57.006 --> 04:58.298
for the very first time.

04:58.382 --> 05:02.052
You all know him from
his hit song "You Send Me."

05:02.136 --> 05:06.598
Ladies and gents, let’s give
a warm Copacabana welcome

05:06.682 --> 05:08.892
-for Sam Cooke!
-(applause)

05:08.976 --> 05:11.061
(band playing
lively jazz music)

05:19.111 --> 05:20.779
It’s great to be
at the Copacabana!

05:20.863 --> 05:21.905

05:21.989 --> 05:23.866
How’s everybody
feeling tonight?

05:23.949 --> 05:25.909
(people clearing throats)

05:25.993 --> 05:28.829
(scattered applause)

05:28.912 --> 05:31.832
Uh, I-I want
to tell you that, uh,

05:31.915 --> 05:34.126
ever since I started singing,

05:34.209 --> 05:36.879
before I even knew
I wanted to be a singer,

05:36.962 --> 05:39.048
playing the Copa has always
been a dream of mine.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.340
So thank you for being here

05:40.424 --> 05:43.427
on the night
that dream comes true.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.679
(people coughing)

05:48.891 --> 05:52.311
I thought I’d start off
this evening, uh,

05:52.394 --> 05:56.440
with something that
you all might recognize.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.816
Boys.

I’m here to see Mr. Carlton.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.458
Would you tell him
that Jim Brown is...

09:01.541 --> 09:03.627
Jim Brown? Oh.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.379
God! From the NFL!

(both chuckle)

09:06.588 --> 09:08.173
Grandpa!

09:08.257 --> 09:12.678
Jim Brown from the NFL is here,
and he wants to see you.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.472
(laughing):
Well, I never.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.557
(chuckles)

09:17.641 --> 09:20.060
Never.

09:20.143 --> 09:23.355
Would you look
at who’s on my porch.

09:23.438 --> 09:26.066
(chuckles):
James Nathaniel Brown.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.776
Hello there, Mr. Carlton.

09:27.859 --> 09:28.902
Don’t you "hello" me.

Put her there, son.

09:30.821 --> 09:31.863
(chuckles)

09:31.947 --> 09:34.324
Come now, have a seat with me.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.410
Can I get you
something to drink?

09:36.493 --> 09:37.703
Lemonade, maybe?

09:37.786 --> 09:39.329
Oh, that’s all right.
Thank you, though.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.164
Well, suit yourself.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.750
I’m certainly having me some.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.711
Fetch us a couple glasses
of that lemonade,

09:45.794 --> 09:47.462
-would you, sweetie?
-(in distance): Yes, Grandpa.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.172
Just in case
you change your mind.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.340
-Hmm.
-(chuckles)

09:50.424 --> 09:52.384
How long you been
back on the island?

09:52.467 --> 09:54.303
Oh, I just got in last night.

09:54.386 --> 09:57.097
And you came by to say hello?

09:57.180 --> 09:58.932
How thoughtful of you, Jimmy.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.560
Well, my aunt says
you were anxious to see me.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.229
I’m an early riser, so I
thought I’d come right on over.

10:04.313 --> 10:06.064
Mm, the early bird
does catch the worm.

10:06.148 --> 10:08.400
-Mm.
-But you already know that.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.777
You caught a hell of
a lot of worms this year.

10:10.861 --> 10:11.945
(both chuckle)

10:12.029 --> 10:13.780
I guess you can say that.

10:13.864 --> 10:18.869
No man who’s run
1,860 yards in a season

10:18.952 --> 10:20.829
needs to be so humble.

10:20.912 --> 10:24.624
Actually, it was 1,863.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.460
-Oh, that’s more like it.
-Mm-hmm.

10:26.543 --> 10:29.421
That record is gonna stand
the test of time.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.298
You know, I’d happily
give that record back

10:31.381 --> 10:33.467
for a win over the Packers
in that last game.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.219
(chuckles) That Packers win
is gonna be forgotten

10:36.303 --> 10:39.056
by anyone who doesn’t live
in Goose Bay by tomorrow.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.390
Hmm.

10:40.474 --> 10:43.352
Your record is gonna be
remembered forever.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.103
I don’t see why
I can’t have the record

10:45.187 --> 10:46.813
and the win next time.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.107
Right you are, son.
Right you are.

10:50.359 --> 10:54.780
Jimmy, I-I just wanted
to-to let you know,

10:54.863 --> 10:57.407
if there’s ever anything
I can do for you,

10:57.491 --> 11:00.327
you should never hesitate
to reach out.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.040
Um, that’s...

11:06.291 --> 11:08.085
That’s-that’s mighty kind
of you, sir.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.670
Oh, our families go way back.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.005
Been looking after one another

11:12.089 --> 11:14.633
since the first folks
settled on this island.

11:14.716 --> 11:18.678
I wanted to make sure
that I told you face-to-face,

11:18.762 --> 11:23.350
as long as I’m still here,
that ain’t ever gonna change.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.311
Well, my aunt would be
very happy to hear

11:26.395 --> 11:29.564
such a kind sentiment
from you, Mr. Carlton.

11:29.648 --> 11:32.526
Not everyone else on the island
has been so supportive.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.361
Ah, crabs in a barrel, I say.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.405
-To hell with them all.
-(chuckles)

11:36.488 --> 11:40.075
I, for one, think
that you are a credit

11:40.158 --> 11:44.204
not only to this community but
to the entire state of Georgia.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.789
I’ve never been prouder to say

11:45.872 --> 11:47.791
that I live on
St. Simons Island

11:47.874 --> 11:49.918
-than I am now.
-Mm.

11:50.001 --> 11:53.755
And I would make
a point of adding

11:53.839 --> 11:56.716
"the place where
the great Jim Brown is from."

11:56.800 --> 11:58.760
(chuckles)

11:58.844 --> 11:59.928
Huh?

12:01.805 --> 12:04.307
-Here you boys go.
-Ah.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.642
Two lemonades.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.102
Thank you, darling.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.147
-Well, thank you.
-Mm.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.691
Uh, sorry to bother you while
you’re entertaining, Grandpa,

12:12.774 --> 12:15.193
but if you could
come move that bureau,

12:15.277 --> 12:16.695
when-when you have a moment.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.864
Oh. Sorry.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.365
I almost forgot.
(chuckles)

12:20.449 --> 12:23.910
You, uh... you moving
some furniture?

12:23.994 --> 12:25.412
Mm-hmm.

12:25.495 --> 12:29.416
Well, you know, uh, you should
let me help you with that.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.084
Ah, so considerate
of you, Jimmy,

12:31.168 --> 12:33.587
but you know we don’t allow
niggers in the house,

12:33.670 --> 12:35.964
so it’s quite all right.

12:36.047 --> 12:39.843
It really is wonderful
to see you, son.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.012
You keep up the good work.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.223
Do us all proud.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.269
MIKE WALLACE:
While city officials,

12:49.352 --> 12:51.897
state agencies, white liberals

12:51.980 --> 12:55.775
and sober-minded Negroes
stand idly by,

12:55.859 --> 12:57.235
a group of Negro dissenters is

12:57.319 --> 12:59.654
taking to street corner
step ladders, church pulpits,

12:59.738 --> 13:01.448
sports arenas
and ballroom platforms

13:01.531 --> 13:05.744
across the United States
to preach a gospel of hate

13:05.827 --> 13:07.954
that would set off
a federal investigation

13:08.038 --> 13:10.332
if it were preached
by Southern whites.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.459
For some time between
now and 1970,

13:12.542 --> 13:15.086
Elijah Muhammad,
founder and spiritual leader

13:15.170 --> 13:16.296
-of the group,
-(chuckles softly)

13:16.379 --> 13:17.964
has intimated
that he will give the call

13:18.048 --> 13:20.133
for the destruction
of the white man.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.843
Here you will hear
Elijah Muhammad

13:21.927 --> 13:23.720
introduced by
minister Malcolm X,

13:23.803 --> 13:25.263
the Muslims’ New York leader

13:25.347 --> 13:27.224
and ambassador-at-large
for the movement.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.477
Now, in the church,
we-we used to sing the song

13:30.560 --> 13:32.562
"Good News,
the Chariot Is Coming."

13:32.646 --> 13:34.981
-Is-is that right or wrong?
-CROWD: That’s right.

13:35.065 --> 13:39.653
But what we must bear in mind
is that what’s good news to you

13:39.736 --> 13:42.030
might be bad news to another.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.491
And while you sit here today

13:44.574 --> 13:47.744
knowing that you have come
to hear good news,

13:47.827 --> 13:50.413
you must realize in advance,

13:50.497 --> 13:53.166
what’s good news for the sheep,

13:53.250 --> 13:55.585
well, that might be
bad news for the wolf.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.379
(crowd murmuring, applauding)

13:57.462 --> 13:59.214
(door opens)

14:01.216 --> 14:03.218
I expected you back hours ago.

14:03.301 --> 14:06.012
I know, I know, I know, I know.

14:06.096 --> 14:08.932
I got back as fast as I could.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.768
-Thank goodness you’re safe.
-(sighs)

14:11.851 --> 14:13.603
...and the wisest
and most fearless

14:13.687 --> 14:15.480
Black man in America...

14:15.564 --> 14:17.065
Where are the girls?

14:17.148 --> 14:18.608
I put them to bed.

14:18.692 --> 14:22.404
Oh, I promised I’d be here
in time to tuck them in.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.492
(clicks tongue)

14:28.368 --> 14:29.828
I’m really sorry.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.372
But you can put them to bed
tomorrow night.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.082
-Right.
-(chuckles softly)

14:34.165 --> 14:36.042
Tomorrow.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.714
Did you speak to him?

14:42.299 --> 14:43.633
(smacks lips)

14:43.717 --> 14:45.385
Yes.

14:46.303 --> 14:47.762
And?

14:49.389 --> 14:53.518
Louis X said that if I decide
to leave the Nation of Islam,

14:53.602 --> 14:55.395
I will be doing so on my own.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.772
-Damn him!
-Betty.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.275
Please.

15:00.358 --> 15:03.820
Please just...
don’t wake up the girls.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.448
He wouldn’t even be
in the Nation if not for you,

15:06.531 --> 15:08.199
let alone running
the Boston temple.

15:08.283 --> 15:11.578
And he remains thankful
for my mentorship.

15:13.121 --> 15:16.291
You told him about
the Messenger’s indiscretions?

15:16.374 --> 15:19.836
All of the secretaries,
all of the children?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.671
And that didn’t
sway him at all?

15:21.755 --> 15:22.797
No, the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad...

15:22.881 --> 15:23.882
Oh, don’t say "Honorable."

15:23.965 --> 15:25.342
...was his lure to the Nation,

15:25.425 --> 15:29.095
just like he was for me
and so many others.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.723
Now imagine convincing someone

15:31.806 --> 15:34.851
to convert to Christianity and
then telling that same person

15:34.934 --> 15:36.144
to leave the church because

15:36.227 --> 15:37.979
Christ was not
who you said he was.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.231
Louis could stroll right over
to any of the seedy apartments

15:40.315 --> 15:43.360
Elijah Muhammad has those
poor young girls holed up in

15:43.443 --> 15:46.196
and see the proof of his deeds
with his own eyes.

15:46.279 --> 15:50.033
Perhaps Louis X just isn’t
ready to see that truth.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.327
Maybe none of them are.

16:01.711 --> 16:04.255
What are we gonna do now?

16:04.339 --> 16:06.091
The Nation owns this house.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.717
The car.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.511
Everything we have.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.596
The second they learn
about your plan...

16:11.680 --> 16:14.766
I am hoping our friendship
will keep Brother Louis

16:14.849 --> 16:17.018
from sharing our plans
with anyone else.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.311
You can’t count on that.

16:18.395 --> 16:20.355
I have to.

16:20.438 --> 16:24.317
I have to until I can
make other arrangements.

16:27.696 --> 16:30.407
What else can be done?

16:30.490 --> 16:35.954
You-- We are all alone
if we go through with this.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.208
For the moment.

16:40.291 --> 16:44.879
But I have one more
potential ace up my sleeve.

16:46.381 --> 16:47.882
What?

16:47.966 --> 16:50.051
♪ ♪

16:56.474 --> 16:57.809

17:12.407 --> 17:14.951

You need to get on out of there
’fore you get yourself killed.

17:19.289 --> 17:21.458
He’s right, kid. You need to
get your head into this fight.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.918
My head is
into the fight, Angie.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.754
You sat in on any more
of Liston’s training sessions

17:25.837 --> 17:27.338
-like I asked?
-(grunts)

17:27.422 --> 17:28.506
No need.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.133
No need, no need.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.136
Watching Sonny Liston train
is like... being at the circus.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.513
He looks like one of them
big ugly bears they have

17:35.597 --> 17:37.098
riding around
on tiny little bikes.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.975
All he needs is that
itty-bitty hat on his head.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.727
He ain’t no boxer.
He’s an animal.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.980
He’s an animal that can tear
you apart if you don’t focus.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.106
-Mm-hmm.
-You make the same mistakes

17:45.190 --> 17:46.566
with him
as you did with Cooper,

17:46.649 --> 17:48.026
you won’t be walking away
from it.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.778
I won that Cooper fight,
didn’t I?

17:49.861 --> 17:50.862
You got saved by the bell.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.447
And he would’ve finished
the job

17:52.530 --> 17:53.823
if they didn’t stop the fight
from all the bleeding.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.325
Oh, woulda, coulda,

17:55.408 --> 17:57.160

And where on earth
are you going?

18:00.288 --> 18:01.414
To check on Malcolm.

18:01.498 --> 18:02.749
Oh, good grief.

18:06.002 --> 18:08.171
You got something else
on your mind, Angie?

18:08.254 --> 18:10.965
Do I need to remind you how
unhappy the Louisville Group is

18:11.049 --> 18:12.300
about him being here?

18:12.383 --> 18:13.593
What they got to be mad about?

18:13.676 --> 18:15.595
I been training hard as hell
for this fight.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.096
Well, they’re the ones paying
for all the training.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.389
They’re paying for all of us.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.724
I’m just letting you know

18:19.808 --> 18:21.559
they’ve been giving me
a lot of grief.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.102
What business is Malcolm
of theirs?

18:23.186 --> 18:24.938
You don’t understand why
a bunch of white businessmen

18:25.021 --> 18:26.689
might be a little stung
by a guy

18:26.773 --> 18:29.442
who says they’re all
natural born demons?

18:29.526 --> 18:32.278
Mm-hmm. That’d do it.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.197
He said "devils."

18:34.280 --> 18:36.407
Malcolm’s never been anything
but kind to you, Angelo.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.493
I know,
but the investors only know

18:38.576 --> 18:40.954
what they see on TV,
and that ain’t good.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.163
They pay for my training.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.915
They don’t get to choose
my friends for me.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.000
Well, training’s what they want
their money going towards,

18:46.084 --> 18:49.420
not some white-man-hating
demagogue’s airfare.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.506
What did the investors say
when they gave me my money?

18:52.841 --> 18:54.384
That it was yours to do with...

18:54.467 --> 18:57.554
To do with as I please, Angie.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.180
And if it pleases me
to bring my friend down

18:59.264 --> 19:00.849
to give me
the spiritual support I need

19:00.932 --> 19:01.933
to win this fight,

19:02.016 --> 19:03.184
then that’s what I’m gonna do.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.519
They want their money back,

19:04.602 --> 19:06.771
I’ll pay it back to all of ’em,
with interest,

19:06.855 --> 19:08.648
after the fight.
Now, if you all will excuse me,

I didn’t ask to stay

MALCOLM: Is Brother Cassius
there with you?

21:19.821 --> 21:23.366
No. He’s probably doing some
last-minute prep for the fight.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.201
-Why?
-Oh, uh...

21:25.284 --> 21:27.203
I thought he might come by

21:27.286 --> 21:29.706
before heading
to the convention center

21:29.789 --> 21:32.208

Wrestling, no, I can’t say

25:00.583 --> 25:01.876

25:19.310 --> 25:20.895
They boo him,
they scream at him,

25:20.978 --> 25:24.106

the more he eggs ’em all on.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.069

25:28.152 --> 25:29.946
Rassling is complicated.

yourself

25:31.239 --> 25:33.115
after a person
everyone hates, Cash?

25:33.199 --> 25:37.620

pays $100

They say he threw his arm out.

29:57.546 --> 29:58.923
That’s Sam Cooke.
Get out my way.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.091
Out my way, out my way.
Get off me.

30:01.175 --> 30:03.219
Malcolm! Malcolm!

30:03.302 --> 30:05.846
Aah! I told ’em! I told ’em!

30:05.930 --> 30:08.724
Eat your words!
Eat your words!

30:08.807 --> 30:10.643
Eat your words! I remember you!

30:10.726 --> 30:11.977
I remember you!
You picked him!

30:12.061 --> 30:13.103
I told you!

30:13.187 --> 30:16.482
I remember you,
and I remember you.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.692
(engine revs)

30:21.320 --> 30:24.490
(chatter in Spanish)

30:25.658 --> 30:27.326
(grunts)

30:27.409 --> 30:30.538
(exhales, chuckles)

30:30.621 --> 30:32.873
Is this where the party’s at?

30:32.957 --> 30:34.416
Mr. Cooke.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.501
(car door shuts)

30:35.584 --> 30:37.169
I’m Brother Kareem.

30:37.253 --> 30:38.796
The brother minister
instructed us

30:38.879 --> 30:40.798
to let you in
if you arrived early.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.591
I’m the first one here?

30:42.675 --> 30:44.051
That’s correct.

30:44.134 --> 30:45.803
Me and my fast-ass cars.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.430
(chuckles)
So?

30:48.514 --> 30:50.641
This way, please.

30:58.148 --> 31:00.276
(laughing)

31:06.824 --> 31:08.993
(chuckles)

31:28.470 --> 31:30.639
(sighs)

31:32.891 --> 31:35.144
(airplane passing overhead)

31:41.233 --> 31:43.527
(quietly):
It’s a damn dump.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.700
-(snaps fingers)
-Hmm.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.119
-(snaps fingers)
-Mm.

31:52.202 --> 31:54.413
(latches clacking)

31:56.665 --> 31:58.834
(case shuts)

32:00.127 --> 32:02.254

(chuckles softly)

32:44.630 --> 32:46.548
Right.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.883
-Too quick, man.
-Too fast!

32:47.966 --> 32:50.052
-I’m fast, man.
-I-I couldn’t see...

32:50.135 --> 32:52.554
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

32:52.638 --> 32:54.807
I think he caught a glimpse
of his own reflection

32:54.890 --> 32:56.141
and got scared.

32:56.225 --> 32:58.560
-Is that what it was?
-(horn honks)

32:58.644 --> 33:00.229
Oh...

33:00.312 --> 33:02.022
-That was beautiful, Cash.
-Oh.

33:02.106 --> 33:04.108
-What a night!
-Whoa.

33:04.191 --> 33:05.651
-Oh, man.
-(chuckles)

33:05.734 --> 33:06.735
Yes, sir.

33:06.819 --> 33:07.903
He ran out of gas.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.321
There wasn’t
a station around nowhere.

33:09.405 --> 33:11.240
I’m telling you, man,
this is the start.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.908
This is the start right here,
man.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.493
-Come out for the seventh.
-Just the beginning.

33:14.576 --> 33:16.078
-That’s right.
-Hey.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.579
-CASSIUS: Just the beginning.
-JIM: Just the beginning.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.123
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

33:19.206 --> 33:20.708
-Whose night is it?
-Where’s-where’s Sam?

33:20.791 --> 33:22.292
-Come on, man. Show us the way.
-Who’s the champ?

33:22.376 --> 33:23.794
-Who’s the champ?
-Oh, you know who the champ is.

33:23.877 --> 33:25.087
-Who’s the champ?
-You know who the champ is.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.171
-Who?
-I thought I was the champ.

33:26.255 --> 33:27.631
(chuckling)

33:27.715 --> 33:29.425
-Whew!
-(chuckles)

33:29.508 --> 33:31.260
-Whew.
-Told ’em. I told ’em.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.470
-You got him in six, Cash.
-I told ’em, El Negro,

33:33.554 --> 33:35.222
Campiano, King Bacadero...

33:35.305 --> 33:36.849
Your friend
has already arrived.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.350
-JIM: What the hell does
that mean? -I’d assumed.

33:38.434 --> 33:41.186
-CASSIUS: King of Miami.
-His car is hard to miss.

33:41.270 --> 33:43.272
-All right.
-Yes.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.399
Well, we let him into your room
as you instructed.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.234
Oh, that’s much appreciated.

33:47.317 --> 33:48.610
Is there anything else
you need?

33:48.694 --> 33:50.821
No, brother.
We’ll be fine from here.

33:50.904 --> 33:53.407
-God is great.
-He really is, isn’t he?

33:53.490 --> 33:54.950
SAM:
Mm-hmm.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.744
The hell took y’all so long?

33:56.827 --> 33:58.829
Ah, well, we didn’t run
every damn red light

33:58.912 --> 34:01.498
between the convention center
and Overtown.

34:01.582 --> 34:02.916
CASSIUS: Man, we told you
to ride with us.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.752
What, and leave my car
at the arena parking lot?

34:04.835 --> 34:07.045
Fuck that. Besides,
I had to drop off Barbara.

34:07.129 --> 34:09.757
-(strums guitar)
-Well, was you sad, Sam?

34:09.840 --> 34:11.258
Sitting in here
all by your lonesome?

34:11.341 --> 34:13.177
I don’t need y’all around
to entertain myself.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.220
CASSIUS: We figured you’d have
rounded up some girls

34:15.304 --> 34:16.889
-before we even got here, boy.
-(strumming guitar)

34:16.972 --> 34:18.515
-Where they at? -SAM: Shit,
ain’t you too tired?

34:18.599 --> 34:19.933
Tired? Boy, I’m energized.

34:20.017 --> 34:22.144
Was before I even threw
the first punch.

34:22.227 --> 34:23.687
SAM:
All right.

34:23.771 --> 34:25.439
Man, can you believe
they had the nerve

34:25.522 --> 34:28.400
to trot Willie Pastrano
into the ring before the fight?

34:28.484 --> 34:30.652
You know, they say he boxes
just like you, Cash.

34:30.736 --> 34:31.862
(laughing):
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

34:31.945 --> 34:33.071
Like me?

34:33.155 --> 34:34.615
-Are you insane?
-Hey.

34:34.698 --> 34:36.909
Willie Pastrano-- that’s
the dancing master, ain’t it?

34:36.992 --> 34:39.745
CASSIUS: Shit, if he’s
the dancing master, I must be

34:39.828 --> 34:41.663
the motherfucking inventor
of dance.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.707
-Just ask Sonny.
-Oh, you goddamn right.

34:43.791 --> 34:46.710
I am 210 and a half pounds
of trouble, boys.

34:46.794 --> 34:48.796
And what they didn’t know
was when they weighed me in,

34:48.879 --> 34:51.006
a half pound of it
wasn’t even me.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.090
Oh, what was it, Cash?

34:52.174 --> 34:54.259
It was
a half pound of divine skill

34:54.343 --> 34:57.262
-bestowed upon me from
God up on high! -Hey! -JIM: Oh.

34:57.346 --> 34:58.639
-This motherfucker here.
-All right.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.432
They had Joe Louis
on one side of the ring,

35:00.516 --> 35:02.601
Rocky Marciano in the other.

35:02.684 --> 35:05.062
Halfway through the sixth,
out the corner of my eye,

35:05.145 --> 35:06.355
I saw them looking
at each other

35:06.438 --> 35:07.940
like they was
asking themselves,

35:08.023 --> 35:10.317
"Why couldn’t we do that
when we was young?"

35:10.400 --> 35:11.485
(laughing)

35:11.568 --> 35:13.237
I’m serious.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.823
If tonight don’t prove God
was with me, then nothing does.

35:15.906 --> 35:17.491
Well, he sure as shit
wasn’t with Sonny.

35:17.574 --> 35:18.659
Oh, man,
you know Sonny a damn heathen.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.494
And what do they always say,
Malcolm?

35:20.577 --> 35:21.662
The penalty one pays

35:21.745 --> 35:23.413
for avoiding the path
of righteousness

35:23.497 --> 35:26.333
-is walking whatever other path
they choose alone. -Mm-hmm.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.960
-Yes, that’s right.
-(others murmuring)

35:28.043 --> 35:30.087
Yes, yes,
Cassius Marcellus Clay

35:30.170 --> 35:33.131
is the new heavyweight champion
of the world, boys!

35:33.215 --> 35:35.133
-Yes, he is! Yes, he is!
-CASSIUS: And I don’t even have

35:35.217 --> 35:37.052
-a scratch on my fa...
-(Sam laughs)

35:41.640 --> 35:43.350
Oh, my goodness.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.185
-Cassius.
-What’s wrong, Cash?

35:45.269 --> 35:47.062
What? Cash, what...

35:48.856 --> 35:50.315
Why am I so pretty?

35:50.399 --> 35:52.109
-Ah.
-Ah.

35:52.192 --> 35:53.819
And I’m only 22 years old.

35:53.902 --> 35:56.154
There is no way
I’m supposed to be this great.

35:56.238 --> 35:58.365
Look, Alexander the Great
conquered the whole world

35:58.448 --> 35:59.908
at the age of 30...

35:59.992 --> 36:02.411
-Yeah. -...and I conquered
the world of boxing at 22,

36:02.494 --> 36:04.413
without sustaining
so much as a scratch.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.540
-That’s right. -Ah!
-SAM: There he goes!

36:06.623 --> 36:09.126
-You do the math.
-SAM: All right.

36:09.209 --> 36:11.044
Where and when is
this party going down?

36:11.128 --> 36:13.547
Yeah, that’s a good question.
What’s on the agenda, Malcolm?

36:13.630 --> 36:16.425
Well, I thought this would be
a wonderful chance for us

36:16.508 --> 36:18.802
to reflect on
what’s happened tonight.

36:18.886 --> 36:21.555
Like our young brother said,
there’s no denying

36:21.638 --> 36:23.974
that greater forces
were at work.

36:27.311 --> 36:30.522
You mean...
no one else is coming?

36:30.606 --> 36:33.358
Oh, rest assured, my brother,
you’re not missing anything.

36:33.442 --> 36:35.652
But I...

36:35.736 --> 36:37.654
I wanted some pussy tonight.

36:37.738 --> 36:39.406
Ah, it’ll be all right, Jimmy.
I think you’ll live.

36:39.489 --> 36:41.867
Hey, hey, Malcolm, I...
(chuckles)

36:41.950 --> 36:43.327
I-I did not give up a chance

36:43.410 --> 36:45.078
to stay and party
at the Fontainebleau

36:45.162 --> 36:46.330
for this shit.

36:46.413 --> 36:47.748
-(water running)
-MALCOLM: The Fontainebleau?

36:47.831 --> 36:49.541
The Fontainebleau Miami Beach?

36:49.625 --> 36:51.126
What, you just walked
right up to the counter

36:51.209 --> 36:53.253
-and booked yourself a room,
Brother Sam? -Malcolm, relax.

36:53.337 --> 36:55.631
Allen booked the room.
Allen booked the room.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.591
Allen Klein. The white man.

36:57.674 --> 36:59.176
-SAM: That’s his job.
-MALCOLM: Oh, that’s his job?

36:59.259 --> 37:00.969
To tell the other crackers that
you’re one of the good ones?

37:01.053 --> 37:02.512
-To do what I ask him to do.
-Will you two quit

37:02.596 --> 37:04.097
the philosophical debate
for five seconds?

37:04.181 --> 37:06.183
Ain’t you just heard Jim say
he’s getting blue balls?

37:09.978 --> 37:11.730
All right.

37:11.813 --> 37:14.483
We at least have something
to eat while we reflect?

37:14.566 --> 37:17.319
Yes, as a matter of fact,
we do, Brother Sam.

37:18.612 --> 37:19.947
Just because I’m militant

37:20.030 --> 37:22.199
doesn’t mean I don’t know
how to have a good time.

37:22.282 --> 37:23.825
(Cassius snaps fingers)

37:25.494 --> 37:27.204
-What’d I do?
-MALCOLM: Yeah!

37:28.246 --> 37:29.748
Ice cream.

37:29.831 --> 37:32.167
I don’t suppose you have
any beer in there?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.710
Stupid question.

37:33.794 --> 37:35.921
Chips, then. Maybe chips?

37:36.004 --> 37:38.256
Uh... I’m sure I can send

37:38.340 --> 37:40.175
one of the brothers out
to get some, Sam.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.593
Well, what flavor is it?

37:41.677 --> 37:43.804
Well, we have vanilla, Jimmy...

37:47.140 --> 37:48.517
...and vanilla.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.061
-Shit.
-How’s that for irony?

37:51.144 --> 37:52.562
Last time I checked,
Brother Sam,

37:52.646 --> 37:54.982
vanilla was
your flavor of choice.

37:55.065 --> 37:57.275
-(laughing): Ooh-hoo-hoo.
-SAM: All right.

37:57.359 --> 37:58.360
That’s right, Jack.

37:58.443 --> 37:59.653
Hey, fellas, I’m just saying,

37:59.736 --> 38:01.613
can’t we at least
go someplace hoppin’?

38:01.697 --> 38:04.658
The entire city of Miami
is celebrating Cassius’s win.

38:04.741 --> 38:05.909
Yeah, they was all expecting

38:05.993 --> 38:07.494
to be partying
with Sonny Liston tonight.

38:07.577 --> 38:10.664
Yeah, and it seem to me
it’s not a great idea,

38:10.747 --> 38:12.332
your first night as world champ,

38:12.416 --> 38:15.043
starting it off by throwing
away all that goodwill.

38:15.127 --> 38:18.088
MALCOLM:
Goodwill? Goodwill from whom?

38:18.171 --> 38:20.215
Goodwill from the press,

38:20.298 --> 38:22.134
who threw their support
behind that thug,

38:22.217 --> 38:24.386
hoping that he’d put
our young brother in his place?

38:24.469 --> 38:26.179
No, you out of your mind, Sam.

38:26.263 --> 38:30.892
And besides, besides,
part of the reason we’re here

38:30.976 --> 38:34.021
is to celebrate
Cassius’s official transition.

38:34.104 --> 38:35.105
Malc!

38:35.188 --> 38:37.691
Transition?

38:37.774 --> 38:38.817
To what?

38:38.900 --> 38:40.861
Shall we give them the news,
Cassius?

38:40.944 --> 38:44.740
Well, I suppose if, uh,
you want to tell them, Malcolm.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.116
SAM:
Now, wait a second.

38:47.534 --> 38:50.120
You ain’t about to say
what I think you gonna say?

38:50.203 --> 38:52.914
I’ve been thinking
long and hard about it, boys,

38:52.998 --> 38:57.544
and I’m officially joining
the Nation of Islam.

38:59.171 --> 39:00.505
(Jim chuckles)

39:00.589 --> 39:03.800
Cassius, are you sure
that’s such a good idea?

39:03.884 --> 39:04.926
CASSIUS:
Why not?

39:05.010 --> 39:06.303
Well, I thought
this Muslim jive

39:06.386 --> 39:07.929
was something

-Look, man,

39:31.495 --> 39:33.080
I’m always in the hot seat,
all right?

ain’t one fucking thing

can do about it.

48:04.299 --> 48:06.634
-Are you crying?
-(chuckles)

48:06.718 --> 48:09.762
I’m just... happy.

48:10.722 --> 48:12.473
-Oh.
-(car engine starts)

48:12.557 --> 48:13.933
So am I.

48:14.851 --> 48:16.311
So am I.

48:16.394 --> 48:17.854
And is he going to...

48:17.937 --> 48:21.024
He’ll be announcing tomorrow
morning that he’s a Muslim.

48:21.107 --> 48:23.067
(exhales)

48:23.151 --> 48:27.113
Well, do you think
he’ll go along with your plan?

48:27.196 --> 48:32.952
Well, it’s too soon to tell,
but, uh, I feel good about it.

48:34.370 --> 48:37.540
Oh, Malcolm.

48:37.624 --> 48:40.376
You were the only one
who believed in him. (chuckles)

48:40.460 --> 48:44.297
It’s only fitting that you and
Cassius be blessed in this way.

48:44.380 --> 48:46.758
That you do
this thing together.

48:46.841 --> 48:49.510
Well, I really do
believe in him, Betty.

48:49.594 --> 48:51.554
Well, he believes in you, too.

48:51.638 --> 48:53.681
As well as he should.

48:53.765 --> 48:55.516
(chuckles)

Hey, Cash.

48:57.310 --> 48:58.645
Can I tell you something?

48:58.728 --> 49:01.689
Of course, man, anything.

49:01.773 --> 49:03.274
I did a movie.

49:03.358 --> 49:04.734
You produced a movie?

49:04.817 --> 49:07.487
Nah, man, I starred in one.

49:07.570 --> 49:10.323
(chuckles)

49:10.406 --> 49:13.451
Oh, well, that’s great, Jim,
but you’re not an actor.

49:13.534 --> 49:15.286
That’s what I told the cat
who wanted to cast me,

49:15.370 --> 49:17.246
but he put me
in his Western anyway.

49:17.330 --> 49:19.165
-A Western, huh?
-Yeah.

49:19.248 --> 49:22.418
Okay, so, uh,
who-who do you play?

49:22.502 --> 49:24.545
I play a buffalo soldier.

49:24.629 --> 49:26.047
I’m part of this special unit,

49:26.130 --> 49:28.299
and, uh, we’re tracking
this Confederate general.

49:28.383 --> 49:30.343
He’s being protected
by these Apaches.

49:30.426 --> 49:31.469
Damn.

49:31.552 --> 49:33.221
-That sounds pretty good.
-Yeah.

49:33.304 --> 49:35.223
-So you’re the hero?
-One of them.

49:35.306 --> 49:37.392
But my character gets killed
about halfway through,

49:37.475 --> 49:39.268
-so when...
-(laughing)

49:39.352 --> 49:40.561
What?

49:40.645 --> 49:42.313
No, nothing, man. I just...

49:42.397 --> 49:45.149
I should’ve known as soon as
you said "Black action hero,"

49:45.233 --> 49:48.820
the next part of that sentence
was gonna be "who gets killed."

49:48.903 --> 49:50.905
Hmm.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.573
It went well, man.

49:52.657 --> 49:55.076
I think there might be
a future for me in this.

49:55.159 --> 49:57.620
Being the sacrificial Negro
in some Western

49:57.704 --> 49:59.831
ain’t the same as the NFL, man.

49:59.914 --> 50:02.959
But how much you getting paid
to be in this movie?

50:03.042 --> 50:06.504
(chuckles)

50:06.587 --> 50:09.465
$37,000.

50:11.342 --> 50:12.343
-Damn.
-Mm-hmm.

50:12.427 --> 50:13.511
That’s pretty good.

50:13.594 --> 50:15.221
It’s a lot easier
on my knees, too.

50:15.304 --> 50:18.099
Yeah, but the only reason
they want you in that movie

50:18.182 --> 50:20.518
is ’cause people know you
from football.

50:20.601 --> 50:25.231

-Looking sharp now. -MALCOLM:
It’s a Rolleiflex 3.5.

57:33.450 --> 57:36.620
A German twin-lens
reflex camera.

57:36.704 --> 57:38.581
It’s a fine piece
of engineering, gents.

57:38.664 --> 57:40.958
You see, it has this,
uh, pop-out viewfinder.

57:41.041 --> 57:42.126
Well, it looks bulky.

57:42.209 --> 57:43.502
MALCOLM:
No, Jimmy, it’s a work of art.

57:43.586 --> 57:44.587
JIM:
Hmm.

57:44.670 --> 57:46.422
(camera clicks)

57:47.548 --> 57:49.175
Yeah. Besides, uh, you know,

57:49.258 --> 57:52.052
I’ve always got my Nikon handy
for taking photos on the move.

57:52.136 --> 57:54.847
Like when you’re running
from the Feds?

57:54.930 --> 57:55.931
-(chuckles)
-Yeah.

57:56.015 --> 57:57.892
Or, uh, riding on a camel.

57:58.934 --> 58:01.854
Mm. Where to?

58:01.937 --> 58:04.148
-Mecca.
-(Jim chuckles softly)

58:04.231 --> 58:06.567
Ah, you’re going
to Saudi Arabia?

58:06.650 --> 58:07.943
MALCOLM:
Mm-hmm.

58:08.027 --> 58:09.195
Yes.

58:09.278 --> 58:10.696
All Muslims are
supposed to do it

58:10.779 --> 58:12.489
at least once
in their lives, Sam.

58:12.573 --> 58:15.701
And, well, since I’m not doing
any speaking right now, this...

58:15.784 --> 58:17.828
this feels like
as good a time as any.

58:17.912 --> 58:20.789
Oh, maybe I’ll take a few
detours while I’m out there.

58:20.873 --> 58:22.958
Be quite amazing to see
the Great Pyramids.

58:23.042 --> 58:25.211
Man, that sounds fantastic.

58:25.294 --> 58:26.879
Oh, it will be.

58:26.962 --> 58:29.048
If your schedule permits,
you should join me.

58:29.131 --> 58:31.425
Hey, count me in.

58:31.508 --> 58:32.843
-JIM: Yeah?
-Count me in.

58:32.927 --> 58:35.179
I mean, fine African sisters.

58:35.262 --> 58:37.389
Come on, Jim,
I know you’re down with that.

58:37.473 --> 58:39.725
Oh, with the ladies,
most definitely.

58:39.808 --> 58:40.935
But I’m up for another part.

58:41.018 --> 58:42.353
So, see, in between that
and camp,

58:42.436 --> 58:44.104
I won’t have time
for a trip to Africa.

58:44.188 --> 58:46.732
Hey, you should consider
coming as well, Sam.

58:46.815 --> 58:48.859
Leaving this country
in the rearview for a while

58:48.943 --> 58:51.695
is a great way
to get some perspective.

58:51.779 --> 58:53.656
Nah, I’m busy, too.

58:53.739 --> 58:56.242
One can never be too busy
for some added perspective.

58:56.325 --> 58:58.160
SAM:
Nah, I’m swamped, man.

58:58.244 --> 59:02.289
And I got to prep
to go back to the Copa.

59:02.373 --> 59:03.707
(laughing):
Oh, come on, man.

59:03.791 --> 59:06.001
You need to go on
and forget about the Copa.

59:06.085 --> 59:07.753
It was not that bad.

59:07.836 --> 59:10.089
CASSIUS:
Come on, man.

59:10.172 --> 59:12.174
All right, fine,
maybe it was that bad.

59:12.258 --> 59:13.634
Well, y-you don’t shuck
and jive enough

59:13.717 --> 59:15.302
for those ofay tastes.

59:15.386 --> 59:18.264
I may not dance around a stage
like Jackie or James Brown,

59:18.347 --> 59:20.349
but that’s not what
I’m selling, all right?

59:20.432 --> 59:24.311
I’m selling my voice,
my words, my image...

59:24.395 --> 59:25.562
my-my message.

59:25.646 --> 59:27.398
MALCOLM:
Your message? Hmm.

59:27.481 --> 59:29.191
The problem is, at the Copa,
you have to sell that message

59:29.275 --> 59:30.567
to a bunch of white folks.

59:30.651 --> 59:32.945
That don’t matter.
They got souls, don’t they?

59:33.028 --> 59:34.280
And every living thing
with a soul

59:34.363 --> 59:35.864
can have that soul tapped into.

59:35.948 --> 59:37.241
-I thought you’d know that.
-Do you think,

59:37.324 --> 59:38.701
just maybe,
your energy’s misdirected, Sam,

59:38.784 --> 59:39.910
trying to tap into
white people’s souls?

59:39.994 --> 59:41.745
No, I don’t.

59:41.829 --> 59:43.706
If I win them over,
playing our music,

59:43.789 --> 59:45.708
I’m-I’m knocking down doors
for everybody.

59:45.791 --> 59:47.001
You watch and see.

59:47.084 --> 59:49.795
It’s not gonna always be
the pop charts over here,

59:49.878 --> 59:51.630
Black music charts over there.

59:51.714 --> 59:53.799
-One day, it’s gonna be
one chart... -Mm.

59:53.882 --> 59:55.801
...with one music,
for all people.

59:55.884 --> 59:57.219
What kind of message
are you sending, though,

59:57.303 --> 59:58.887
by doing one show
for white folks

59:58.971 --> 1:00:00.431
and a completely different show
for Black folks, Sam?

1:00:00.514 --> 1:00:02.182
-(scoffs)
-You... N-No, listen to me.

1:00:02.266 --> 1:00:04.018
You’re performing in-in places
where the only Black people

1:00:04.101 --> 1:00:06.020
not onstage are the ones
serving the food.

1:00:06.103 --> 1:00:07.771
Don’t you think I know that?

1:00:07.855 --> 1:00:09.940
Can’t tell you how many times
I wanted to reach out

1:00:10.024 --> 1:00:11.442
and punch somebody,
but you c...

1:00:11.525 --> 1:00:13.235
Then, then, then, then
strike with the weapon

1:00:13.319 --> 1:00:15.404
that you have, man, your voice!

1:00:15.487 --> 1:00:17.281
Black people--
we-we standing up.

1:00:17.364 --> 1:00:19.700
-Mm-hmm.
-We-we speaking out.

1:00:19.783 --> 1:00:24.163
Sam, you have possibly
one of the most effective,

1:00:24.246 --> 1:00:26.957
beautiful outlets of us all.

1:00:27.041 --> 1:00:28.584
Y-You’re not using it
to help the cause, brother.

1:00:28.667 --> 1:00:30.794
The hell I’m not.

1:00:30.878 --> 1:00:33.172
I got the masters to my songs.

1:00:33.255 --> 1:00:34.465
I started a label.

1:00:34.548 --> 1:00:35.883
I’m producing
tons of Black artists.

1:00:35.966 --> 1:00:38.302
Don’t you think my determining

1:00:38.385 --> 1:00:40.179
my creative
and business destiny

1:00:40.262 --> 1:00:42.056
is every bit
as inspiring to people

1:00:42.139 --> 1:00:44.975
as you standing up on a podium
trying to piss them off?

1:00:45.059 --> 1:00:47.227
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot.

1:00:47.311 --> 1:00:49.355
That’s all you do!

1:00:49.438 --> 1:00:50.856
Sam, I do plenty.

1:00:50.939 --> 1:00:53.025
Oh, do you? Let’s see.
You suck at sports.

1:00:53.108 --> 1:00:54.318
Well, I-I was never
much into football.

1:00:54.401 --> 1:00:55.527
SAM:
Can’t sing.

1:00:55.611 --> 1:00:57.738
Damn sure can’t make shit
out of no peanut.

1:00:57.821 --> 1:00:59.281
Is there a point
to this rant, Sam?

1:00:59.365 --> 1:01:01.158
My point is that sometimes
I feel like you’re just like

1:01:01.241 --> 1:01:03.160
all the rest of them people out
there, obsessed with the stars.

1:01:03.243 --> 1:01:04.953
-(laughing)
-Oh, no, no, no, Cash.

1:01:05.037 --> 1:01:06.205
-SAM: You look around.
Look around. -Let him finish.

1:01:06.288 --> 1:01:08.499
SAM:
Which one of us don’t belong?

1:01:08.582 --> 1:01:11.418
-Don’t belong?
-(chuckles): Don’t belong.

1:01:11.502 --> 1:01:13.045
Brother Sam,
the only person here

1:01:13.128 --> 1:01:15.047
white people seem to like--

1:01:15.130 --> 1:01:16.423
that would be you.

1:01:16.507 --> 1:01:18.258
-(laughs) -Hey, y’all need
to cool it now, man.

1:01:18.342 --> 1:01:21.261
You know, you always managed
to just be around for shit,

1:01:21.345 --> 1:01:22.471
haven’t you?

1:01:22.554 --> 1:01:24.181
Maybe your daddy
should’ve beaten you better.

1:01:24.264 --> 1:01:25.974
-Jimmy, I’m gonna kick this
motherfucker’s ass. -Oh, whoa.

1:01:26.058 --> 1:01:27.726
You can let him go. Let him go.

1:01:27.810 --> 1:01:29.061
Everything all right,
Brother Malcolm?

1:01:29.144 --> 1:01:30.646
-SAM: What do you want?
-Hey. Hey.

1:01:30.729 --> 1:01:31.939
-Get your motherfucking hands
off me! -Hey. Hey.

1:01:32.022 --> 1:01:33.732
Oh, I don’t think so.

1:01:33.816 --> 1:01:36.360
Our job here is to protect
the brother minister.

1:01:36.443 --> 1:01:39.154
Listen, Kareem, I don’t need
your protection, brother.

1:01:41.031 --> 1:01:45.869
Well, now that that’s settled,
away you go.

1:01:45.953 --> 1:01:47.663
Negro, I will leave
when I am good...

1:01:47.746 --> 1:01:48.831
You best think long and hard

1:01:48.914 --> 1:01:50.958
’fore you wag that tongue
at me.

1:01:57.548 --> 1:01:58.674
God is great.

1:01:58.757 --> 1:02:00.467
MALCOLM:
Yeah, greater than any of us.

What’s wrong with you, Sam?

1:02:19.653 --> 1:02:21.280
You’re supposed to be

1:02:21.363 --> 1:02:24.199

That’s Malcolm.

Brother Sam?

You know, what is
going on around us,

1:03:01.945 --> 1:03:04.615
it should make everyone angry.

1:03:04.698 --> 1:03:07.409
Uh, you know,
you bourgeois Negroes,

1:03:07.493 --> 1:03:09.828

to really understand
what is at stake here.

1:03:13.457 --> 1:03:16.210
What, you-you think
Cash being the world champ

1:03:16.293 --> 1:03:18.921
is gonna protect him
from the devils

1:03:19.004 --> 1:03:21.590
that harassed him from
the first day that he got here?

1:03:21.673 --> 1:03:23.133

-JIM: Hmm?

1:03:25.302 --> 1:03:27.387
Jimmy is the best
football player in the world,

but he is also giving money
to Black-owned businesses.

1:03:29.681 --> 1:03:31.808
What, you-you don’t think
that-that threatens

1:03:31.892 --> 1:03:32.893
a lot of white people?

1:03:32.976 --> 1:03:33.977
Hmm?

1:03:34.061 --> 1:03:35.187
You don’t think the FBI is

1:03:35.270 --> 1:03:36.438
probably starting
to follow him around, too?

1:03:36.522 --> 1:03:37.940
Oh, man, now you’re gonna
fucking jinx me.

1:03:38.023 --> 1:03:39.566
And that is why, Brother Sam,

1:03:39.650 --> 1:03:43.779
this-this movement that
we are in is called a struggle.

1:03:43.862 --> 1:03:46.907

self-righteous motherfucker.

1:04:48.093 --> 1:04:49.428
And, to boot, most of them are

1:04:49.511 --> 1:04:52.598
versions of the church songs
that nurtured you.

1:04:52.681 --> 1:04:54.891
You-you twisted them
and you perverted them

1:04:54.975 --> 1:04:56.893
to feed a-a white crowd.

1:04:56.977 --> 1:04:58.437
SAM:
That is bullshit.

1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:01.440
Most of the artists I work with
are gospel sing--

1:05:01.523 --> 1:05:03.650
And do you have any idea what
I’ve given back to the church?

1:05:03.734 --> 1:05:05.861
Do you know-- h-how many times
do I have to hear that, Jimmy?

1:05:05.944 --> 1:05:07.446
You know, that has got to be
the greatest fault

1:05:07.529 --> 1:05:10.198
of you so-called,
uh, successful Negroes.

1:05:10.282 --> 1:05:12.034
-You’ll do something
detrimental... -Here he goes.

1:05:12.117 --> 1:05:14.244
...to your own people
with the promise that-that,

1:05:14.328 --> 1:05:16.997
after you get rich, then you’re
gonna make it back up to them.

1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:18.749
With-with a handout.

1:05:18.832 --> 1:05:20.542
Or some gesture of patronage.

1:05:20.626 --> 1:05:22.919
-Malcolm, Malcolm, all right.
-No, Jimmy.

1:05:23.003 --> 1:05:25.631
And what you don’t get,
Brother Sam:

1:05:25.714 --> 1:05:27.674
you’ve made it, brother.

1:05:27.758 --> 1:05:30.260
But for all the others,
the majority of people

1:05:30.344 --> 1:05:31.970
who had their own
self-destructive dreams

1:05:32.054 --> 1:05:35.390
and didn’t make it,
what they left behind?

1:05:35.474 --> 1:05:38.810
No, all they left behind
is a legacy of negativity!

1:05:38.894 --> 1:05:40.437
But that’s okay,
’cause they all meant well.

1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:42.522
JIM: Malcolm, will you please
have some damn ice cream?

1:05:42.606 --> 1:05:44.524
You will never be loved
by the people

1:05:44.608 --> 1:05:47.194
you’re trying so hard
to win over.

1:05:47.277 --> 1:05:48.445
Never.

1:05:48.528 --> 1:05:51.990
You’re just a windup toy
in a music box.

1:05:52.074 --> 1:05:53.867
A-A monkey.

1:05:53.950 --> 1:05:55.369
That’s what you are.

1:05:55.452 --> 1:05:58.997
You’re a monkey dancing
for an organ grinder to them.

1:06:02.751 --> 1:06:04.336
(whistles)

1:06:04.419 --> 1:06:06.755
Y’all pulled out the knives.

1:06:06.838 --> 1:06:10.175
And if I get cut,
I’m fittin’ to hurt somebody.

1:06:15.597 --> 1:06:17.724
(sighs)

1:06:24.481 --> 1:06:27.109
MALCOLM: Cassius,
who-who were those English boys

1:06:27.192 --> 1:06:29.403
you-you were hanging out with
a couple days ago?

1:06:29.486 --> 1:06:30.779
CASSIUS:
The Beatles.

1:06:30.862 --> 1:06:32.948
MALCOLM:
Yes, The "Be-a-tles."

1:06:33.031 --> 1:06:35.575
(Malcolm scoffs)

1:06:35.659 --> 1:06:37.619
All that time you spent
on the road, Sam,

1:06:37.703 --> 1:06:41.123
entertaining the children
of bigots,

1:06:41.206 --> 1:06:43.667
and at the end of the day,
white folks would still rather

1:06:43.750 --> 1:06:44.960
import their popular music.

1:06:45.043 --> 1:06:47.170
CASSIUS:
Just hold on one second.

1:06:48.672 --> 1:06:51.758
Now, yeah, The Beatles,
th-they’re funny...

1:06:53.427 --> 1:06:55.929
...but they ain’t no Sam Cooke.

1:06:56.012 --> 1:06:58.181
(chuckles softly)

1:06:58.265 --> 1:07:00.475
They’re-they’re...
they’re more of a fad.

1:07:00.559 --> 1:07:04.604
Yeah, well, if not them,
then-then someone else, Cash.

1:07:04.688 --> 1:07:09.192
The bottom line: this is
too important a time, brother,

1:07:09.276 --> 1:07:11.403
to be wasting a-a brilliant

1:07:11.486 --> 1:07:14.072
and-and creative mind
on pandering.

1:07:14.156 --> 1:07:16.324
And it’s too damn hot in here
to be wearing that blazer.

1:07:16.408 --> 1:07:17.951
So what’s your point?

1:07:18.034 --> 1:07:19.494
My-my point is,

1:07:19.578 --> 1:07:22.914
Brother Sam, that I am just
one voice in this struggle.

1:07:22.998 --> 1:07:24.666
Just one.

1:07:24.750 --> 1:07:26.543
And Cassius, Cassius--
he’s another

1:07:26.626 --> 1:07:30.630
who-who pushes us forward with
his fists and with his words.

1:07:30.714 --> 1:07:34.092
And Jimmy, Jimmy pushes us
forward with his fearlessness

1:07:34.176 --> 1:07:36.928
and-and his relentlessness.

1:07:37.012 --> 1:07:38.430
My point is that you, brother,

1:07:38.513 --> 1:07:41.850
you could be the loudest voice
of us all.

1:07:45.312 --> 1:07:47.272
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
says that if we...

1:07:47.355 --> 1:07:48.607
No, hold on, hold on.

1:07:48.690 --> 1:07:49.941
Now, I ain’t ask you

1:07:50.025 --> 1:07:51.193
what the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad thought.

1:07:51.276 --> 1:07:53.528
I asked you what you thought.

1:07:53.612 --> 1:07:55.071
There you go with,

1:07:55.155 --> 1:07:56.490
"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
says this,

1:07:56.573 --> 1:07:59.159
Honorable Elijah Muhammad
says that."

1:07:59.242 --> 1:08:01.244
And when the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad tells you

1:08:01.328 --> 1:08:02.746
to shut the fuck up,

1:08:02.829 --> 1:08:04.873
-you damn sure do that, too.
-No.

1:08:04.956 --> 1:08:06.374
What is going on
between the Nation and me, Sam,

1:08:06.458 --> 1:08:08.210
-is way more complicated.
-But you still obey them.

1:08:08.293 --> 1:08:09.294
When they tell you
to come out here

1:08:09.377 --> 1:08:11.421
and-and recruit Cassius

1:08:11.505 --> 1:08:12.923
to become a member of something
you don’t even seem to believe!

1:08:13.006 --> 1:08:14.341
What are you talking about?
I’m not making-- I’m not--

1:08:14.424 --> 1:08:15.550
I’m not making Cassius
do anything!

1:08:15.634 --> 1:08:17.594
Ca-- He came to me for insight.

1:08:17.677 --> 1:08:19.679
He-he had questions.
(stammers)

1:08:19.763 --> 1:08:22.224
His passion for Islam
comes from a pure place, Sam.

1:08:22.307 --> 1:08:24.768
CASSIUS:
"Passion" is...

1:08:24.851 --> 1:08:25.852
(exhales)

1:08:25.936 --> 1:08:28.104
...kind of a strong word.

1:08:39.658 --> 1:08:41.993
Well, you couldn’t stop talking
about how excited you were

1:08:42.077 --> 1:08:44.621
-to come out with your faith
to the world, Cash. -True.

1:08:44.704 --> 1:08:46.998
True. I was.
I am. It’s just that...

1:08:47.082 --> 1:08:48.792
-What is it? -If we’re being
completely honest and all,

1:08:48.875 --> 1:08:50.794
I guess being a Muslim

1:08:50.877 --> 1:08:55.090
sounded like a much better idea
before tonight.

1:08:59.928 --> 1:09:03.515
How could you have
any second thoughts, Cash? I...

1:09:03.598 --> 1:09:05.475
You’re on top of the world.
I-I don’t understand.

1:09:05.559 --> 1:09:09.104
He didn’t actually think he was
gonna win tonight, Malcolm.

1:09:09.187 --> 1:09:11.439
-Cash?
-Course I knew.

1:09:11.523 --> 1:09:13.441
I’m the best...
(exhales)

1:09:13.525 --> 1:09:14.901
I’m the greatest
there ever will be.

1:09:14.985 --> 1:09:16.570
-I’m-I’m just saying that...
-Easy, Cassius.

1:09:16.653 --> 1:09:18.071
No, I’m good.

1:09:19.114 --> 1:09:21.449
I’m just a little nervous
is all.

1:09:21.533 --> 1:09:23.493
That’s natural, ain’t it?

1:09:27.539 --> 1:09:29.332
Malcolm.

1:09:33.587 --> 1:09:36.631
SAM: It takes a hustler
to see a hustle.

1:09:38.383 --> 1:09:41.261
Say, let me ask you something,
Mr. Know-It-All.

1:09:44.389 --> 1:09:48.685
How is it helpful
for Black people

1:09:48.768 --> 1:09:52.314
to run their businesses
different than everyone else’s?

1:09:52.397 --> 1:09:54.524
Dumber than everyone else’s?

1:09:54.608 --> 1:09:56.109
No.

1:09:56.192 --> 1:09:58.695
No one’s accused you of making
bad business decisions, Sam.

1:09:58.778 --> 1:10:00.196
You might as well have.

1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:02.657
You think I don’t know
about the British Invasion?

1:10:03.658 --> 1:10:06.494
I invested
in the British Invasion.

1:10:08.288 --> 1:10:10.248
I have these protégés.

1:10:10.332 --> 1:10:11.416
Valentinos.

1:10:11.499 --> 1:10:13.418
Five Womack brothers.

1:10:13.501 --> 1:10:17.088
The youngest one, Bobby, wrote
this song, "It’s All Over Now."

1:10:17.172 --> 1:10:18.798
Great tune.

1:10:18.882 --> 1:10:20.800
The band records it.
It’s fantastic.

1:10:20.884 --> 1:10:22.385
All over the R&B charts.

1:10:22.469 --> 1:10:27.140
It even went to number 94
on Billboard’s Hot 100.

1:10:27.223 --> 1:10:29.559
Then I get a call from England.

1:10:29.643 --> 1:10:31.478
One of these British bands
wants to record

1:10:31.561 --> 1:10:33.063
-a cover version.
-The Beatles?

1:10:33.146 --> 1:10:35.148
Nah, Cash. They call themselves
the Rolling Stones.

1:10:35.231 --> 1:10:36.608
Oh, like the Muddy Waters song.

1:10:36.691 --> 1:10:37.984
SAM:
Exactly.

1:10:38.068 --> 1:10:39.653
So, Bobby’s like, you know,
"No damn way, man.

1:10:39.736 --> 1:10:41.029
That’s our song, man."

1:10:41.112 --> 1:10:43.073
But... I get the final say,

1:10:43.156 --> 1:10:44.866
and I’m looking
at the big picture.

1:10:44.950 --> 1:10:47.619
And I give the Rolling Stones
permission to record it.

1:10:47.702 --> 1:10:49.871
-You did?
-I did.

1:10:49.955 --> 1:10:51.331
Mm, mm, mm.

1:10:51.414 --> 1:10:53.667
And the Rolling Stones’ version
of the song

1:10:53.750 --> 1:10:56.336
goes all the way to number one.

1:10:56.419 --> 1:10:58.797
Not on the R&B charts.

1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:00.924
Pop charts.

1:11:01.007 --> 1:11:02.884
But, of course, you know,

1:11:02.968 --> 1:11:04.302
once this version
of the song gets big,

1:11:04.386 --> 1:11:06.471
Bobby’s version
just disappears.

1:11:06.554 --> 1:11:08.723
Right? Falls off
the R&B charts. It’s just gone.

1:11:08.807 --> 1:11:10.767
So, of course, Bobby’s crushed.

1:11:10.850 --> 1:11:12.727
Yes, as well he should be, Sam.

1:11:12.811 --> 1:11:15.397
Let me finish.

1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:18.316
He’s crushed
for about six months.

1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:21.611
Because, six months later,

1:11:21.695 --> 1:11:24.030
that first royalty check
comes in.

1:11:24.114 --> 1:11:25.115
(snaps fingers)

1:11:25.198 --> 1:11:26.700
And because Bobby’s the writer

1:11:26.783 --> 1:11:28.535
and my company owns
the rights to the song,

1:11:28.618 --> 1:11:31.079
-that means every time...
-(snapping fingers)

1:11:31.162 --> 1:11:34.082
some white girl buys
a copy of that single,

1:11:34.165 --> 1:11:36.209
she putting money
into my pockets.

1:11:36.292 --> 1:11:38.086
Our pockets.

1:11:38.169 --> 1:11:39.337
(Malcolm chuckling softly)

1:11:39.421 --> 1:11:40.797
White boys out there
touring around,

1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:42.716
they ain’t even know
they working for us.

1:11:42.799 --> 1:11:43.883
Next thing you know,
Bobby’s like,

1:11:43.967 --> 1:11:45.051
"The Rolling Stones
want to cover

1:11:45.135 --> 1:11:46.594
any more versions of my songs?"

1:11:46.678 --> 1:11:48.513
(chuckles)
You know who gets paid more

1:11:48.596 --> 1:11:49.889
than the writer of a song

1:11:49.973 --> 1:11:52.267
that hits number 94
on the Billboard Hot 100?

1:11:52.350 --> 1:11:55.020
-Hmm? -The writer of a song
that hits number one.

1:11:55.103 --> 1:11:56.438
I already knew that.

1:11:56.521 --> 1:11:58.189
Now Bobby knows it, too.

1:11:58.273 --> 1:11:59.649
Tell me
how it’s not empowerment.

1:11:59.733 --> 1:12:01.151
Everybody talks about
they want a piece of the pie.

1:12:01.234 --> 1:12:02.485
Well, I don’t.

1:12:02.569 --> 1:12:05.905
I want the goddamn recipe.

1:12:07.866 --> 1:12:10.660
I congratulate you
on being so shrewd, brother.

1:12:10.744 --> 1:12:12.620
You just don’t get
how everything’s not

1:12:12.704 --> 1:12:14.581
so black and white
like you make it out to be.

1:12:14.664 --> 1:12:17.250
In your mind, President Kennedy
getting assassinated

1:12:17.333 --> 1:12:18.710
is just another one
of those white devils

1:12:18.793 --> 1:12:19.794
getting what they deserve.

1:12:19.878 --> 1:12:21.421
Well, I liked JFK, man.

1:12:21.504 --> 1:12:23.339
My mama cried when he died.

1:12:23.423 --> 1:12:24.466
Mine did, too.

1:12:24.549 --> 1:12:26.134
How do you think
it made me feel

1:12:26.217 --> 1:12:27.761
to have her see my friend
on TV,

1:12:27.844 --> 1:12:28.970
talking about "good riddance"?

1:12:29.054 --> 1:12:30.555
No. I-I didn’t,
I didn’t say-- No.

1:12:30.638 --> 1:12:32.098
Sam, I didn’t say
"good riddance."

1:12:32.182 --> 1:12:34.100
You said it was "chickens
coming home to roost"!

1:12:34.184 --> 1:12:36.728
Yes, I was trying
to make a point, brother!

1:12:36.811 --> 1:12:38.188
-You were paraphrasing.
-SAM: Tell you something else.

1:12:38.271 --> 1:12:40.857
My whole family lives
on the South Side of Chicago,

1:12:40.940 --> 1:12:42.776
not up in Harlem where you are.

1:12:42.859 --> 1:12:45.361
-The Black Muslims...
-"The Nation of Islam" to you.

1:12:45.445 --> 1:12:48.364
The Nation of Islam
is huge in Chicago.

1:12:48.448 --> 1:12:51.076
I know where
Elijah Muhammad’s house is.

1:12:51.159 --> 1:12:52.744
It’s the biggest one
for miles around.

1:12:52.827 --> 1:12:54.412
Looks like
the mayor’s residence.

1:12:54.496 --> 1:12:55.497
Oh, yeah.
I been there for dinner.

1:12:55.580 --> 1:12:56.581
Oh, you been there for dinner.

1:12:56.664 --> 1:12:59.084
So you see how
he lives like a pharaoh.

1:12:59.167 --> 1:13:01.377
Never says nothing about
the crooked Black alderman

1:13:01.461 --> 1:13:03.755
who’s running numbers,
pushing drugs,

1:13:03.838 --> 1:13:06.049
doing all the things
to hurt the community,

1:13:06.132 --> 1:13:08.760
meanwhile condemning
those white devils.

1:13:08.843 --> 1:13:11.346
Come off it, Malcolm.

1:13:11.429 --> 1:13:14.808
(lighter clicks open)

1:13:19.145 --> 1:13:21.189
(chuckles)

1:13:21.272 --> 1:13:23.733
Oh, I got something
for your ass.

1:13:27.487 --> 1:13:29.823
-SAM: ♪ Dum, da-dum, dum. ♪
-(paper crinkling)

1:13:29.906 --> 1:13:32.450
This is the clue that’s gonna
solve the crime, Officer?

1:13:32.534 --> 1:13:34.994
Oh, you could say that.

1:13:35.078 --> 1:13:38.414
You know, I was thinking about
this song I heard on the radio

1:13:38.498 --> 1:13:40.166
the other day, Sam.

1:13:40.250 --> 1:13:44.003
It’s a song
that made me think of you.

1:13:44.087 --> 1:13:46.714
Turns out it’s pretty popular.

1:13:50.385 --> 1:13:53.096

-(music stops)
-I just love those lyrics.

1:14:38.850 --> 1:14:41.436
Especially in the beginning.

1:14:42.562 --> 1:14:46.441
"How many roads
must a man walk down

1:14:46.524 --> 1:14:49.068
before you can call him a man?"

1:14:49.152 --> 1:14:50.403
It’s as though he’s asking,

1:14:50.486 --> 1:14:52.322
"How much do the oppressed
have to do

1:14:52.405 --> 1:14:56.534
before they can be recognized
as human beings?"

1:14:56.618 --> 1:14:58.119
That really gets you thinking,
don’t it?

1:14:58.203 --> 1:15:00.038
I already know
"Blowin’ in the Wind," Malcolm.

1:15:00.121 --> 1:15:02.373
I heard it
when it first came out.

1:15:02.457 --> 1:15:03.666
It didn’t make you angry?

1:15:03.750 --> 1:15:05.627
Why would it?

1:15:07.045 --> 1:15:10.006
Isn’t this Bob Dylan fella
a white boy from Minnesota?

1:15:11.090 --> 1:15:12.508
So what?

1:15:12.592 --> 1:15:14.552
So?

1:15:16.179 --> 1:15:19.224
This is a white boy
from Minnesota

1:15:19.307 --> 1:15:22.393
who has nothing to gain
from writing a song

1:15:22.477 --> 1:15:25.521
that speaks more
to the struggles of our people,

1:15:25.605 --> 1:15:26.981
more to the movement,

1:15:27.065 --> 1:15:29.317
than anything
that you have ever penned

1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:31.736
in your life, brother.

1:15:31.819 --> 1:15:34.614
I-I know I’m not the shrewd
businessperson you are,

1:15:34.697 --> 1:15:36.658
my brother, but since you say

1:15:36.741 --> 1:15:39.911
being vocally in the struggle
is bad for business,

1:15:39.994 --> 1:15:42.205
why has this old song
gone higher on the pop charts

1:15:42.288 --> 1:15:43.498
than anything you got out?

1:15:47.752 --> 1:15:50.838
Why has this song gone higher

1:15:50.922 --> 1:15:53.174
(chuckles):
on the pop charts

1:15:53.258 --> 1:15:56.261
than anything you got out?

1:15:56.344 --> 1:15:57.845
Hmm?

1:16:10.483 --> 1:16:12.110
-Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
-Sam.

1:16:12.193 --> 1:16:13.486
-JIM: Come on, Sam.
-Sam.

1:16:13.569 --> 1:16:14.821
Come back here, man.

1:16:14.904 --> 1:16:15.905
-Sam!
-Sam!

1:16:15.989 --> 1:16:18.283
JIM:
Goddamn it.

1:16:18.366 --> 1:16:20.451
Good riddance.

1:16:34.882 --> 1:16:36.134
That wasn’t necessary.

1:16:36.217 --> 1:16:38.845
Yes, that absolutely
was necessary, Cash.

1:16:38.928 --> 1:16:40.680
-We’re supposed
to be friends, man! -Yes!

1:16:40.763 --> 1:16:42.890
Well, I am his friend,
and that is why

1:16:42.974 --> 1:16:46.936
I am trying to give him
a wake-up call!

1:16:47.020 --> 1:16:51.190
There is no more room
for anyone--

1:16:51.274 --> 1:16:54.402
not you, not me,
not Jimmy, not Sam--

1:16:54.485 --> 1:16:58.031
no one to be standing
on the fence anymore!

1:16:58.114 --> 1:17:03.077
Our people are literally dying
in the streets every day!

1:17:03.870 --> 1:17:07.415
Black people are dying!

1:17:07.498 --> 1:17:09.625
Every day!

1:17:11.377 --> 1:17:14.547
And a line has got to be drawn
in the sand, Jimmy.

1:17:14.630 --> 1:17:18.009
A line that says, "Either
you stand on this side with us,

1:17:18.092 --> 1:17:20.428
or you stand over on that side
against us," Cash.

1:17:20.511 --> 1:17:22.013
And I-I believe,

1:17:22.096 --> 1:17:24.974
I believe in that brother’s
potential, Jimmy,

1:17:25.058 --> 1:17:26.392
too much!

1:17:26.476 --> 1:17:30.021
Too much to let him stay
over on the other side.

1:17:31.731 --> 1:17:34.567
CASSIUS: I better go get him
before he drives off.

1:17:36.235 --> 1:17:38.654
(breathing sharply)

1:17:38.738 --> 1:17:40.948
(door opens, closes)

1:17:50.750 --> 1:17:52.752
(groans softly)

1:17:53.628 --> 1:17:55.380
(grunts)

1:17:55.463 --> 1:17:57.673
(breathing heavily)

1:18:14.357 --> 1:18:16.734
You know...

1:18:16.818 --> 1:18:19.904
I always find it kind of funny
how you light-skinned cats

1:18:19.987 --> 1:18:23.199
end up being so damn militant.

1:18:25.743 --> 1:18:27.161
-How...
-(chuckles)

1:18:27.245 --> 1:18:29.414
(chuckles)

1:18:30.248 --> 1:18:31.874
What do you mean?

1:18:31.958 --> 1:18:35.545
Well, you are yellow
as the sun.

1:18:35.628 --> 1:18:37.672
When I think
about who the most outspoken,

1:18:37.755 --> 1:18:40.883
consequences-be-damned brothers
out there are,

1:18:40.967 --> 1:18:42.135
it’s always
you light-skinned boys.

1:18:42.218 --> 1:18:44.345
You know, you, W.E.B. Du Bois,

1:18:44.429 --> 1:18:45.638
Adam Clayton Powell...

1:18:45.721 --> 1:18:47.223
Well, I-I...

1:18:47.306 --> 1:18:49.559
I never pay any attention
to complexions, Jimmy,

1:18:49.642 --> 1:18:52.603
because we are all,
we are all Black people.

1:18:52.687 --> 1:18:55.648
Don’t suddenly talk to me
like I’m stupid.

1:18:56.816 --> 1:18:59.402
You know we are all
far from the same.

1:18:59.485 --> 1:19:01.487
When the white folks
ain’t around,

1:19:01.571 --> 1:19:03.614
you see
the-the light-skinned girls

1:19:03.698 --> 1:19:05.199
gather together in one corner,

1:19:05.283 --> 1:19:07.618
all the dark-skinned girls
gather in the other and...

1:19:07.702 --> 1:19:08.786
You know.

1:19:08.870 --> 1:19:09.954
Coming up,

1:19:10.037 --> 1:19:11.497
light-skinned cats
get it harder

1:19:11.581 --> 1:19:12.790
from Black people sometimes

1:19:12.874 --> 1:19:15.209
than they do
from the white people.

1:19:16.919 --> 1:19:19.589
Yeah. What are you
trying to say?

1:19:21.591 --> 1:19:23.801
I just wonder
if all this pushing

1:19:23.885 --> 1:19:26.679
and "hard line" this
and "hard line" that

1:19:26.762 --> 1:19:29.765
is really about trying to prove
something to white people,

1:19:29.849 --> 1:19:31.225
or...

1:19:31.309 --> 1:19:33.060
or, Malcolm,
is it about trying

1:19:33.144 --> 1:19:34.729
to prove something
to Black people?

1:19:34.812 --> 1:19:37.315
(Malcolm chuckles)

1:19:38.983 --> 1:19:41.652
Oh, well, I...

1:19:41.736 --> 1:19:43.946
It’s, uh...

1:19:44.030 --> 1:19:47.325
It’s a very interesting way
of looking at things,

1:19:47.408 --> 1:19:48.659
I suppose.

1:19:50.661 --> 1:19:52.121
Yeah.

1:19:52.205 --> 1:19:54.040
Just something I noticed
is all.

1:19:54.123 --> 1:19:55.875
Mm-hmm.

1:19:55.958 --> 1:19:58.085
I just don’t think
you should begrudge Sam

1:19:58.169 --> 1:19:59.629
for being about his business.

1:19:59.712 --> 1:20:01.297
He’s got to be.

1:20:01.380 --> 1:20:04.258
I mean, if the goal is
for us to be free,

1:20:04.342 --> 1:20:06.552
to really be free...

1:20:06.636 --> 1:20:07.762
And you know it is.

1:20:07.845 --> 1:20:12.225
...then the key
is economic freedom.

1:20:12.308 --> 1:20:15.561
And no one’s more
economically free than Sam.

1:20:15.645 --> 1:20:17.772
Shit, technically,
he’s the only one of us

1:20:17.855 --> 1:20:20.024
not waiting on a paycheck
from a white man.

1:20:20.107 --> 1:20:22.276
Oh, I-I’m not waiting
on no paycheck

1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:25.112
-from no white man, Jimmy.
-You don’t have a job, Negro.

1:20:27.114 --> 1:20:29.200
-(clears throat)
-Well, I...

1:20:29.283 --> 1:20:30.952
Shit. In the literal sense.

1:20:31.035 --> 1:20:32.036
-You-you-- Yeah.
-I know what you--

1:20:32.119 --> 1:20:34.038
Yeah, I-I know, I know.

1:20:34.121 --> 1:20:36.374
I know what you meant.

1:20:37.333 --> 1:20:38.501
Hey, man.

1:20:39.835 --> 1:20:43.256
You know, the one thing
white folks are masters at

1:20:43.339 --> 1:20:45.466
is tapping into our passions
to a point

1:20:45.550 --> 1:20:48.844
that we forget
about the important stuff.

1:20:50.596 --> 1:20:53.849
I thought you loved
being the hero of the NFL.

1:20:56.727 --> 1:20:58.896
A hero, you say?

1:20:58.980 --> 1:21:00.356
Yeah?

1:21:00.439 --> 1:21:03.568
I ain’t no damn hero to them.

1:21:03.651 --> 1:21:04.986
No.

1:21:05.069 --> 1:21:08.614
You see, Malcolm,
some white folks...

1:21:08.698 --> 1:21:10.908
some white folks
just cannot wait

1:21:10.992 --> 1:21:14.954
to pat themselves on the back
for not being cruel to us.

1:21:15.037 --> 1:21:17.331
Like we should be
singing hosannas

1:21:17.415 --> 1:21:20.459
just because they found
the kindness in their hearts

1:21:20.543 --> 1:21:23.421
to almost treat us
like real human beings.

1:21:23.504 --> 1:21:27.216
I mean, do... do you expect
a dog to give you a medal

1:21:27.300 --> 1:21:29.427
for not kicking it that day?

1:21:29.510 --> 1:21:31.137
Hmm?

1:21:31.220 --> 1:21:32.972
I hate
those motherfuckers more

1:21:33.055 --> 1:21:36.017
than the rednecks
who just put it all out there.

1:21:36.100 --> 1:21:37.977
And I’ll be damned
if I ever forget

1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:39.729
what they really think of me.

1:21:39.812 --> 1:21:42.648
Well, I have no doubt
that you won’t, Jimmy.

1:21:42.732 --> 1:21:46.694
And the thing
that I love about Sam...

1:21:47.820 --> 1:21:51.032
...is that
he doesn’t forget, either.

1:21:51.115 --> 1:21:54.619
And he does not deserve
you implying otherwise.

1:21:54.702 --> 1:21:56.871
No, I’m not implying, J--
I’m...

1:21:56.954 --> 1:21:59.665
Jimmy, I am implying
that brothers like Sam

1:21:59.749 --> 1:22:01.500
and you a-and Cassius--

1:22:01.584 --> 1:22:03.711
you all are
our greatest weapons.

1:22:03.794 --> 1:22:06.964
We are not anyone’s weapons,
Malcolm.

1:22:11.218 --> 1:22:13.888
You need to be, Jimmy.

1:22:13.971 --> 1:22:17.892
You need to be
for-for us to win.

because I caught
one of your shows in Chicago.

you know how Sam does,

Malcolm?

1:34:20.072 --> 1:34:22.407
Well, like I said, my, um...

1:34:22.491 --> 1:34:26.370
my relationship
with, uh, the Nation has...

1:34:26.453 --> 1:34:28.663
has gotten complicated.

1:34:30.165 --> 1:34:33.418
I-I don’t know how much longer
I’ll be in it.

1:34:34.961 --> 1:34:38.340
Wait a second. You’re leaving
the Nation of Islam?

1:34:40.092 --> 1:34:42.928
I thought once you went in,
you were in it for life.

1:34:43.011 --> 1:34:45.806
(chuckles):
I guess I’ll be, uh...

1:34:45.889 --> 1:34:48.308
I’ll be putting that theory
to the test, Sam.

Why would you want to leave?

1:34:53.772 --> 1:34:55.482
All the things you told me.

1:34:56.691 --> 1:34:59.236
The things you showed me
that the Nation does.

1:34:59.319 --> 1:35:01.279
Oh, Cash, there’s...

1:35:01.363 --> 1:35:03.281
there’s lots of good and
righteous brothers and sisters

1:35:03.365 --> 1:35:06.284
in the Nation,
but it’s the leadership

1:35:06.368 --> 1:35:08.620
that has-has shown
that it’s not up to the task.

1:35:08.703 --> 1:35:10.539
Wait.

1:35:10.622 --> 1:35:15.043
So you’re gonna help me
cross over to being a Muslim

1:35:15.127 --> 1:35:17.129
and then quit being Muslim?

1:35:17.212 --> 1:35:19.089
No. No, no, no. No, Cassius.

1:35:19.172 --> 1:35:22.134
I will always,
always be Muslim.

1:35:22.217 --> 1:35:25.512
I-In, you know, in fact, I-I...

1:35:25.595 --> 1:35:31.059
I guess you could say, uh, I’m
becoming more Muslim than ever.

1:35:33.478 --> 1:35:34.855
I’m not understanding.

1:35:36.189 --> 1:35:37.732
Well, uh...

1:35:37.816 --> 1:35:40.610
I’m not leaving just to be
out alone in the world.

1:35:40.694 --> 1:35:42.612
I’m...

1:35:42.696 --> 1:35:44.865
I’m leaving to...

1:35:47.117 --> 1:35:49.035
I’m leaving to start
a new organization,

1:35:49.119 --> 1:35:53.123
one-one that adheres
more closely to the, uh, honest

1:35:53.206 --> 1:35:56.001
and, uh, righteous tenets
of Islam.

1:35:58.753 --> 1:36:02.382
Who’s gonna be
in this new organization?

1:36:02.466 --> 1:36:06.470
I think lots of people
will follow me over, Cash.

1:36:06.553 --> 1:36:08.346
Especially, uh...

1:36:10.098 --> 1:36:12.350
...i-if you-you come with me.

1:36:28.492 --> 1:36:29.784
Say something.

1:36:29.868 --> 1:36:31.453
-You motherfucker!
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:36:31.536 --> 1:36:33.413
Hey, hey, Cash, Cash, Cash.
Hey!

1:36:33.497 --> 1:36:35.373
You’ve been using me!

1:36:35.457 --> 1:36:37.000
No, no, brother,
I’m trying to save you.

1:36:37.083 --> 1:36:39.169
-Wait. -You’re the only one
that needs saving!

1:36:39.252 --> 1:36:41.213
-No.
-MALCOLM: Cash.

1:36:41.296 --> 1:36:42.923
-(sighs)
-Cash.

1:36:44.090 --> 1:36:45.675
If you don’t believe
in your heart

1:36:45.759 --> 1:36:48.345
I’ve been
an honest friend to you,

1:36:48.428 --> 1:36:50.597
then-then you shouldn’t
join me, brother.

1:36:50.680 --> 1:36:52.807
If there’s any-any part of you
that-that believes

1:36:52.891 --> 1:36:55.393
that our time together
has been motivated in any way

1:36:55.477 --> 1:37:00.023
by selfishness
or-or opportunism on my part...

1:37:00.106 --> 1:37:02.692
brother, I...

1:37:02.776 --> 1:37:04.986
brother, I encourage you,

1:37:05.070 --> 1:37:06.905
walk away from me.

1:37:08.281 --> 1:37:10.575
Walk away from me with
a clear mind and conscience,

1:37:10.659 --> 1:37:12.494
knowing that that is
the right thing,

1:37:12.577 --> 1:37:14.788
that’s-that’s the only thing
you can do.

1:37:22.003 --> 1:37:25.090
MAN: Cassius Marcellus Clay,
you in there, champ?

1:37:25.173 --> 1:37:26.341
(knock on door)

1:37:26.424 --> 1:37:27.842
MAN 2:
Tell us about what happened...

1:37:27.926 --> 1:37:30.095
JAMAAL: We got a bunch
of reporters out here.

1:37:30.178 --> 1:37:32.931
(reporters chattering)

1:37:33.014 --> 1:37:35.100
There they are.

1:37:36.726 --> 1:37:41.815
Some... someone must have saw
me and Sam downstairs.

1:37:41.898 --> 1:37:45.694
Uh, well, you can’t blame them
for wanting a word

1:37:45.777 --> 1:37:48.238
from the new world champion.

1:37:48.321 --> 1:37:50.657
(Cassius clears throat, sighs)

1:37:50.740 --> 1:37:53.827
Yeah. (sniffs)

1:37:53.910 --> 1:37:55.912
I guess I got to go
talk to them,

1:37:55.996 --> 1:37:57.789
help them sell a few papers.

1:37:57.872 --> 1:37:59.708
MALCOLM:
Absolutely.

1:38:12.804 --> 1:38:14.973
(sighs)

1:38:15.807 --> 1:38:17.726
You coming?

1:38:26.109 --> 1:38:27.611
Um...

1:38:27.694 --> 1:38:29.112
Well, I...

1:38:29.195 --> 1:38:32.574
I don’t have any comments
to make right now, Cash. I...

1:38:32.657 --> 1:38:35.201
(chuckles) And besides, they’re
here to see you, brother.

1:38:35.285 --> 1:38:37.495
Not here to see me.

1:38:38.997 --> 1:38:41.333
I want you standing with me.

1:38:53.762 --> 1:38:55.430
Very well.

1:38:55.513 --> 1:38:57.307
Uh...

1:38:57.390 --> 1:38:59.601
You brothers will excuse us.

1:39:05.690 --> 1:39:07.192
(reporters clamoring)

1:39:07.275 --> 1:39:09.569
CASSIUS: I told you suckers
I was the greatest!

1:39:09.653 --> 1:39:11.154
All of you must bow!

1:39:11.237 --> 1:39:12.822
Oh, I think you guys...

1:39:12.906 --> 1:39:16.242
This is one strange
fucking night.

1:39:18.161 --> 1:39:19.579
Yeah.

1:39:21.206 --> 1:39:23.708
Hey, you know I know what’s
going on out there, right?

1:39:23.792 --> 1:39:25.251
Uh, yeah.

1:39:25.335 --> 1:39:27.504
You know, Cassius, he out there
talking to the press.

1:39:27.587 --> 1:39:29.089
No, I mean out...

1:39:29.172 --> 1:39:31.007
out-out there.

1:39:32.467 --> 1:39:34.469
I mean...

1:39:34.552 --> 1:39:37.180
just ’cause I haven’t released
any records about the movement

1:39:37.263 --> 1:39:40.475
don’t mean I haven’t written
any songs about the movement.

1:39:40.558 --> 1:39:42.268
Come on, man.
Look, you know Malcolm.

1:39:42.352 --> 1:39:44.979
He’s all fire and brimstone
about everything, man.

1:39:45.063 --> 1:39:47.649
But when I heard the
Bob Dylan song, I was mad, man.

1:39:47.732 --> 1:39:49.484
Why?

1:39:50.652 --> 1:39:52.862
’Cause it’s fucking good.

1:39:52.946 --> 1:39:54.614
Well, good.
(chuckles)

1:39:54.698 --> 1:39:55.699
Good.

1:39:55.782 --> 1:39:57.409
You should feel
competitive, man.

1:39:57.492 --> 1:40:00.078
It’s not just ’cause
it was good. It’s...

1:40:00.161 --> 1:40:01.788
I felt like...

1:40:03.289 --> 1:40:05.792
...felt like I should’ve
written that song.

1:40:07.419 --> 1:40:10.630
I mean, I’m-I’m calling myself
"Mr. Soul," and I...

1:40:10.714 --> 1:40:13.216
I haven’t written anything
like that.

1:40:16.010 --> 1:40:18.596
Why don’t you start?

1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:20.306
I started working on something.

1:40:20.390 --> 1:40:22.225
Um...

1:40:22.308 --> 1:40:25.562
started working on something
the first day I heard the song.

1:40:26.730 --> 1:40:27.939
Really?

1:40:28.022 --> 1:40:30.984
Yeah, but it’s-it’s...
it’s different.

1:40:31.067 --> 1:40:34.529
And I haven’t even played it
for a crowd yet.

1:40:37.991 --> 1:40:40.285
How does it go?

1:40:41.828 --> 1:40:44.372
All these so-called experts
were all wrong.

1:40:44.456 --> 1:40:47.041
Next time, don’t-don’t ask
no bookies who’s gonna win.

1:40:47.125 --> 1:40:49.544
You come to me.
I’ll tell you who’s gonna win.

1:40:49.627 --> 1:40:51.546
Cassius, uh,
is it fair to assume

1:40:51.629 --> 1:40:53.339
that, since Malcolm X
is standing here with you,

1:40:53.423 --> 1:40:55.884
that you’re seriously
considering becoming a Muslim?

1:40:55.967 --> 1:40:58.762
I’m not considering anything.
I am a Muslim.

1:40:58.845 --> 1:41:01.014
And from this day forward,
I no longer want to be called

1:41:01.097 --> 1:41:03.224
-by the name Cassius Clay.
-REPORTERS: Mm.

1:41:03.308 --> 1:41:04.559
That is a slave name.

1:41:04.642 --> 1:41:05.977
What are we supposed
to call you, then?

1:41:06.060 --> 1:41:08.813
You will refer to me
as Cassius X.

1:41:08.897 --> 1:41:09.898
-(laughter)
-REPORTER: Malcolm,

1:41:09.981 --> 1:41:11.316
have you been giving Clay
advice

1:41:11.399 --> 1:41:12.776
-on his religious beliefs?
-Look at that.

1:41:12.859 --> 1:41:14.611
MALCOLM:
Well, he’s my brother and...

1:41:14.694 --> 1:41:16.321
New heavyweight champion
of the world.

1:41:16.404 --> 1:41:17.989
MALCOLM:
...my friend.

1:41:18.072 --> 1:41:21.159
I express what I know
and understand, but...

1:41:21.242 --> 1:41:23.244
Cassius,
he has a mind of his own,

1:41:23.328 --> 1:41:25.413
-an understanding of his own.
-Mm-hmm.

1:41:25.497 --> 1:41:26.790
REPORTER 2:
Uh, Cassius, are you gonna

1:41:26.873 --> 1:41:28.082
-give Sonny Liston a rematch?
-Cassius.

1:41:28.166 --> 1:41:30.251
-Cassius. -Cassius.
-Oh, no, man. Come on.

1:41:30.335 --> 1:41:32.128
-Sonny Liston a rematch?
-(chuckles)

1:41:32.212 --> 1:41:34.464
He’s still in the hospital
from after tonight.

1:41:34.547 --> 1:41:35.965
-(laughter, applause)
-Say, man,

1:41:36.049 --> 1:41:37.509
now that this is out the way,

1:41:37.592 --> 1:41:40.178
don’t you think
it’s about time to party?

1:41:40.261 --> 1:41:42.138
-I’d say so.
-Yeah, definitely.

1:41:42.222 --> 1:41:43.223
(cheering)

1:41:43.306 --> 1:41:44.641
CASSIUS:
Man, I’m so fast!

1:41:44.724 --> 1:41:46.434
I’m so fast, after the fight,

1:41:46.518 --> 1:41:48.812
-Miami Vice tried to give me
a speeding ticket! -(cheering)

1:41:48.895 --> 1:41:52.106
If you take Sonny Liston,
Joe Louis

1:41:52.190 --> 1:41:54.651
-and Rocky Marciano...
-(clapping, encouraging chatter)

1:41:54.734 --> 1:41:56.778
I’ll whup ’em all
the same night!

1:41:56.861 --> 1:41:58.530
(cheering)

1:41:58.613 --> 1:42:00.490
That’s what I’ll do next time!

1:42:00.573 --> 1:42:02.283
You know I’m the greatest.

1:42:02.367 --> 1:42:04.494
-OTHERS: Yeah!
-Who’s the greatest?

1:42:04.577 --> 1:42:05.787
-OTHERS: You are!
-That’s right.

1:42:05.870 --> 1:42:07.413
Malcolm, come on.
Put that thing down.

1:42:07.497 --> 1:42:09.332
Come over here.
Someone get a picture of us.

1:42:09.415 --> 1:42:10.625
-(assenting, applause)
-Come on.

1:42:10.708 --> 1:42:12.418
I want a picture with Malcolm.
Come on.

1:42:12.502 --> 1:42:14.337
Let’s see, man.

1:42:14.420 --> 1:42:16.381
You know it’s right.
That’s what I’m talking about.

1:42:16.464 --> 1:42:17.507
Give me some, brothers.

1:42:17.590 --> 1:42:19.425
That’s it. My brother.

1:42:19.509 --> 1:42:20.927
My main man.

1:42:21.010 --> 1:42:22.095
And you, too.

1:42:22.178 --> 1:42:24.305
I told ’em! I told ’em.

1:42:24.389 --> 1:42:26.266
I proved it. I was in Rome.

1:42:26.349 --> 1:42:27.851
They said they had
a man who could beat me.

1:42:27.934 --> 1:42:29.435
-MAN: Yeah!
-Malcolm, come on.

1:42:29.519 --> 1:42:30.687
Get over here.

1:42:30.770 --> 1:42:32.355
-I whupped him, too.

How do you come up
with so many great songs?

1:43:19.193 --> 1:43:21.654
Uh, well, I just really try
and observe

1:43:21.738 --> 1:43:23.114
