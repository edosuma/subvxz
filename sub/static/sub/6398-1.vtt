00:57.401 --> 01:01.785
There's an old joke. Two elderly women
are at a Catskill Mountain resort.

01:01.914 --> 01:05.163
One of 'em says, "The food
at this place is really terrible."

01:05.421 --> 01:08.692
The other one says,
"Yeah, I know. And such small portions."

01:08.860 --> 01:11.403
That's essentially
how I feel about life.

01:11.571 --> 01:15.449
Full of loneliness and misery
and suffering and unhappiness.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.785
And it's all over much too quickly.

01:17.952 --> 01:23.165
The other important joke for me is one
that's usually attributed to Groucho Marx.

01:23.333 --> 01:27.878
I think it appears originally in Freud's
Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious.

01:28.046 --> 01:32.382
It goes like this - I'm paraphrasing.
I would never wanna belong to any club...

01:32.550 --> 01:35.219
...that would have
someone like me for a member.

01:35.386 --> 01:39.681
That's the key joke of my adult life
in terms of my relationships with women.

01:39.849 --> 01:43.435
Lately the strangest things
have been going through my mind.

01:43.603 --> 01:47.106
Cos I turned 40, and I guess
I'm going through a life crisis.

01:47.273 --> 01:51.276
I'm not worried about ageing.
Although I'm balding slightly on top.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.987
That's about the worst
you can say about me.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.406
I think I'm gonna get better as I get older.

01:56.574 --> 01:59.159
I think I'm gonna be
the balding virile type...

01:59.327 --> 02:03.122
...as opposed to, say,
the distinguished grey, for instance.

02:03.289 --> 02:07.584
Unless I'm one of those guys with
saliva dribbling out of his mouth...

02:07.752 --> 02:10.838
...who wanders into a cafeteria
with a shopping bag...

02:11.005 --> 02:13.006
...screaming about socialism.

02:13.174 --> 02:16.969
Annie and I broke up.
And I still can't get my mind around that.

02:17.137 --> 02:21.181
I keep sifting the pieces of
the relationship through my mind...

02:21.349 --> 02:26.019
...examining my life, and trying to
figure out - where did the screwup come?

02:26.187 --> 02:28.897
A year ago we were... in love, you know.

02:29.065 --> 02:33.902
And... It's funny... I'm not a morose type.
I'm not a depressive character.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.779
I... I, uh... You know...

02:35.947 --> 02:38.282
I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess.

02:38.449 --> 02:41.577
I was brought up in Brooklyn
during World War II.

02:42.370 --> 02:46.039
He's been depressed.
All of a sudden he can't do anything.

02:46.207 --> 02:49.418
- Why are you depressed, Alvy?
- Tell Dr Flicker.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.587
It's something he read.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.672
Something he read, uh?

02:53.840 --> 02:57.301
- The universe is expanding.
- The universe is expanding?

02:57.468 --> 03:02.181
The universe is everything. If it's
expanding, someday it will break apart...

03:02.348 --> 03:04.725
...and that will be the end of everything.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.894
What is that your business?

03:07.061 --> 03:09.062
He stopped doing his homework.

03:09.230 --> 03:12.900
- What's the point?
- What has the universe got to do with it?

03:13.067 --> 03:16.361
You're here in Brooklyn!
Brooklyn is not expanding!

03:16.529 --> 03:20.073
It won't be expanding
for billions of years yet, Alvy.

03:20.241 --> 03:24.119
And we've gotta try and enjoy ourselves
while we're here, uh?

03:24.287 --> 03:26.371
Uh? Uh?

03:30.084 --> 03:33.128
My analyst says I exaggerate
my childhood memories.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.048
But I was brought up
under the roller coaster...

03:36.216 --> 03:38.675
...in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.

03:38.843 --> 03:42.721
Maybe that accounts for my personality,
which is a little nervous.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.098
I have a hyperactive imagination.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.643
My mind tends to jump around a little.

03:47.810 --> 03:51.063
I have some trouble
between fantasy and reality.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.774
My father ran the bumper car concession.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.275
There he is.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.777
And there I am.

03:56.945 --> 04:00.989
I used to get my aggression out
through those cars all the time.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.661
I remember the staff at our public school.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.789
We had a saying:
"Those who can't do, teach...

04:08.957 --> 04:11.500
...and those who can't teach, teach gym."

04:11.668 --> 04:16.421
And those who couldn't do anything,
I think, were assigned to our school.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.135
I always thought
my schoolmates were idiots.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.846
Melvyn Greenglass. His fat little face.

04:25.014 --> 04:28.475
And Henrietta Farrell.
Just Miss Perfect all the time.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.937
And Ivan Ackerman.
Always the wrong answer. Always.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.189
Seven and three is nine.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.359
Even then, I knew they were just jerks.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.779
In 1942 I had already discovered women.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.616
Ugh! He kissed me!

04:44.784 --> 04:46.493
He kissed me! Ugh!

04:46.661 --> 04:50.372
That's the second time this month!
Step up here! Step up here!

04:50.540 --> 04:53.375
- What did I do?
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.753
Why? I was just expressing
a healthy sexual curiosity.

04:56.921 --> 05:00.299
Six-year-old boys
don't have girls on their minds.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.425
I did.

05:01.592 --> 05:05.429
For God's sakes, Alvy!
Even Freud speaks of a latency period.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.765
Well, I never had a latency period.
I can't help it.

05:08.933 --> 05:13.562
Why couldn't you have been more like
Donald? Now there was a model boy.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.064
Tell the folks where you are today.

05:16.232 --> 05:19.484
I run a profitable dress company.

05:19.652 --> 05:23.196
Sometimes I wonder
where my classmates are today.

05:23.364 --> 05:27.492
I'm president of
the Pinkus Plumbing Company.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.245
I sell tallises.

05:30.413 --> 05:34.833
I used to be a heroin addict.
Now I'm a methadone addict.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.837
I'm into leather.

05:39.797 --> 05:43.759
I lost track of most of my schoolmates,
but I wound up a comedian.

05:43.926 --> 05:48.972
They did not take me in the army.
I was... Interestingly enough... I was 4-P.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.142
In the event of war, I'm a hostage.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.772
You always only saw the worst in people.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.900
You never could get along
with anyone in school.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.611
You were always out of step
with the world.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.323
Even when you got famous,
you still distrusted the world.

06:06.491 --> 06:09.910
I distinctly heard it.
He muttered under his breath, "Jew."

06:10.078 --> 06:11.286
You're crazy.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.956
We were walking off
the tennis court. Him and me and his wife.

06:15.124 --> 06:19.378
He looked at her and they both looked at
me. And under his breath he said, "Jew."

06:19.545 --> 06:21.546
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.132
I pick up on those kinda things.

06:24.300 --> 06:28.720
I was having lunch with some guys from
NBC. So I said, "Did you eat yet or what?"

06:28.888 --> 06:31.139
And Tom Christie said, "No. D'you?"

06:31.307 --> 06:33.642
Not "Did you". "D'you eat?" "D'you?"

06:33.810 --> 06:37.229
Not "Did you eat?" but "D'you eat?"
"Jew?" You get it? "Jew eat?"

06:37.397 --> 06:39.356
- Max...
- Stop calling me Max.

06:39.524 --> 06:44.277
Why, Max? It's a good name for you.
Max, you see conspiracies in everything.

06:44.445 --> 06:49.658
I was in a record store. There's
this big, tall, blond, crew-cutted guy...

06:49.826 --> 06:54.663
...looking at me in a funny way and saying,
"We have a sale this week on Wagner."

06:54.831 --> 07:00.127
Wagner, Max. Wagner. I know what he's
really trying to tell me, very significantly.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.170
Right, Max.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.214
California, Max.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.300
- Get the hell out of this crazy city.
- Forget it.

07:07.468 --> 07:10.429
We move to sunny LA.
All of show business is there.

07:10.596 --> 07:14.683
No. I don't wanna live in a city
where the only cultural advantage...

07:14.851 --> 07:17.686
...is that you can make
a right turn on a red light.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.605
Forget it.
Aren't you late for meeting Annie?

07:20.773 --> 07:23.942
I'm meeting her at the Beekman.
I have a few minutes.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.919
Are you on television?

07:44.046 --> 07:46.131
No.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.217
Yeah. Once in a while. Occasionally.

07:49.385 --> 07:53.263
- What's your name?
- You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.683
You were on the... uh...
The Johnny Carson, right?

07:57.435 --> 07:59.436
Once in a while, you know.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.605
What's your name?

08:01.772 --> 08:04.024
I'm... I'm Robert Redford.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.193
Come on!

08:06.360 --> 08:09.863
Alvy Singer. It was nice...
Thanks very much for everything.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.323
Hey!

08:11.491 --> 08:12.991
What?

08:13.159 --> 08:15.076
This is Alvy Singer!

08:15.244 --> 08:17.037
Fellas, you know...

08:17.205 --> 08:20.081
This guy's on television.
Alvy Singer? Am I right?

08:20.249 --> 08:22.792
- Give me a break.
- This guy's on television.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.961
I need a large polo mallet.

08:25.129 --> 08:28.131
- Who's on television?
- On The Johnny Carson Show.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.300
Is this a meeting of the Teamsters?

08:30.468 --> 08:33.135
- What programme?
- Can I have your autograph?

08:33.304 --> 08:37.015
- You don't want my autograph.
- No, I do. It's for my girlfriend.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.183
Make it out to Ralph.

08:39.352 --> 08:43.020
- Your girlfriend's name is Ralph?
- It's for my brudder.

08:45.274 --> 08:48.944
- Alvy Singer!
- You're really Alvy Singer, the TV star?

08:49.111 --> 08:51.112
Alvy Singer over here!

08:51.280 --> 08:53.281
It's all right, fellas.

08:53.449 --> 08:56.618
Jesus! What did you do?
Come by way of the Panama Canal?

08:56.786 --> 08:59.955
- I'm in a bad mood.
- I'm here with the cast of The Godfather.

09:00.122 --> 09:04.251
- You have to learn to deal with it.
- I'm dealing with guys named Cheech!

09:04.418 --> 09:06.628
Please. I have a headache, all right?

09:06.796 --> 09:09.756
You are in a bad mood.
You must be getting your period.

09:09.924 --> 09:14.594
Every time anything out of the ordinary
happens, you think I'm getting my period!

09:14.762 --> 09:17.889
A little louder. I think
one of them may have missed it.

09:18.057 --> 09:21.101
- Has the picture started?
- It started two minutes ago.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.395
That's it. Forget it. I can't go in.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.898
- Two minutes, Alvy.
- I can't do it. We've blown it already.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.067
I can't go in in the middle.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.861
We'll only miss the titles.
They're in Swedish.

09:32.029 --> 09:35.574
- You wanna get coffee for two hours?
- Two hours? No. I'm going in.

09:35.741 --> 09:39.411
- Go ahead. Goodbye.
- While we're talking, we could be inside.

09:39.579 --> 09:43.707
Can we not stand here and argue
in front of everybody? I get embarrassed.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.875
All right. So what do you wanna do?

09:46.043 --> 09:48.545
I don't know now.
You wanna go to another movie?

09:48.713 --> 09:50.714
Let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.551
Come on. I'm not in the mood to see
a four-hour documentary on Nazis.

09:54.719 --> 09:58.972
Well, I'm sorry. I've gotta see a picture
exactly from the start to the finish.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.057
Cos... Cos I'm anal.

10:01.225 --> 10:03.602
That's a polite word for what you are.

10:05.855 --> 10:09.733
We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.
It is not one of his best.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.901
It lacks a cohesive structure.

10:12.069 --> 10:16.740
You get the feeling that he's not
absolutely sure what it is he wants to say.

10:16.907 --> 10:20.702
I've always felt he was essentially
a technical filmmaker.

10:20.870 --> 10:25.373
Granted, La Strada was a great film.
Great in its use of negative imagery.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.376
I can't stand this guy.
I'm gonna have a stroke.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.545
Well, stop listening to him.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.048
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

10:33.215 --> 10:37.218
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits
or Satyricon.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.721
I found it incredibly... indulgent.

10:39.889 --> 10:43.475
He really is. He's one of
the most indulgent filmmakers.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.644
The key word here is indulgent.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.604
Without getting...

10:47.772 --> 10:51.858
- What are you depressed about?
- I missed my therapy. I overslept.

10:52.026 --> 10:55.195
- How can you possibly oversleep?
- The alarm clock.

10:55.363 --> 10:58.198
Do you know
what a hostile gesture that is to me?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.909
I know.
Because of our sexual problem, right?

11:01.077 --> 11:04.704
Everybody at The New Yorker
has to know our rate of intercourse?

11:04.872 --> 11:06.665
It's like Samuel Beckett.

11:06.832 --> 11:10.418
I admire the technique,
but it doesn't hit me on a gut level.

11:10.586 --> 11:13.838
- I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
- Stop it, Alvy!

11:14.006 --> 11:17.467
He's spitting on my neck.
He's spitting on my neck when he talks.

11:17.635 --> 11:21.096
You know, you're so egocentric
that if I miss my therapy...

11:21.263 --> 11:24.432
...you can only think of it
in terms of how it affects you.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.601
Weltanschauung is what it is.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.770
Probably on their first date.

11:28.938 --> 11:32.315
Probably met by answering an ad
in the New York Review of Books.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.943
"Thirtyish academic
wishes to meet woman...

11:35.111 --> 11:38.154
...who's interested in Mozart,
James Joyce and sodomy."

11:38.322 --> 11:42.992
Our sexual problem? I'm comparatively
normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

11:43.160 --> 11:47.247
OK. I'm very sorry. My sexual problem.
OK? My sexual problem. Huh?

11:47.415 --> 11:51.751
I never read that. That was a Henry James
novel? Sequel of The Turn of the Screw?

11:51.919 --> 11:54.087
It's the influence of television.

11:54.255 --> 11:58.383
Now, Marshall McLuhan deals with it
in terms of it being a high...

11:58.551 --> 12:01.803
...high intensity.
You understand? A hot medium...

12:01.971 --> 12:05.765
What I wouldn't give for a large sock
with horse manure in it.

12:05.933 --> 12:10.186
What do you do when you get stuck in
a movie line with a guy like this behind?

12:10.354 --> 12:13.356
Why can't I give my opinion?
It's a free country.

12:13.524 --> 12:18.278
Do you have to give it so loud? Aren't
you ashamed to pontificate like that?

12:18.446 --> 12:22.657
The funny part is, you don't know
anything about Marshall McLuhan.

12:22.825 --> 12:27.454
Really? I happen to teach a class
at Columbia called TV, Media and Culture.

12:27.621 --> 12:31.791
So I think my insights into Mr McLuhan
have a great deal of validity.

12:31.959 --> 12:36.463
Oh, do you? That's funny, because
I happen to have Mr McLuhan right here.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.965
Just let me... Come over here a second.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.134
I heard what you were saying.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.303
You know nothing of my work.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.638
You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.

12:45.806 --> 12:49.934
How you ever got to teach a course
in anything is totally amazing.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.187
Boy, if life were only like this!

12:55.983 --> 12:59.861
June 14th, 1940.
The German army occupies Paris.

13:00.029 --> 13:04.657
All over the country, people are desperate
for every available scrap of news.

13:04.825 --> 13:08.244
Those guys in the French
Resistance were really brave.

13:08.412 --> 13:11.456
To have to listen to
Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.876
Sometimes I ask myself
how I'd stand up under torture.

13:15.044 --> 13:19.005
The Gestapo would take away
your Bloomingdale's charge card...

13:19.173 --> 13:21.174
...and you'd tell 'em everything.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.343
That movie makes me feel guilty.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.595
Yeah, cos it's supposed to.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.722
Alvy...

13:27.890 --> 13:30.058
What? What... What's the matter?

13:30.226 --> 13:32.227
I don't... I don't know.

13:32.394 --> 13:37.690
It's not natural. We're sleeping in a bed
together. You know, it's been a long time.

13:37.858 --> 13:42.529
Well, it's just that I gotta sing tomorrow
night, so I have to rest my voice.

13:42.696 --> 13:45.907
There's always an excuse.
You used to think I was very sexy.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.035
When we first started going out,
we had sex constantly.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.163
We're probably
in the Guinness Book of World Records.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.792
Alvy, it'll pass.
I'm going through a phase. That's all.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.003
You've been married before.
You know how things can get.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.548
You were very hot for Allison at first.

14:05.261 --> 14:09.430
You're on right after Chris Brown,
which looks about 20 minutes.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.599
Excuse me. When do I go on?

14:11.767 --> 14:13.768
Who are you?

14:13.936 --> 14:15.937
Alvy Singer.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.480
I'm a comedian.

14:17.648 --> 14:18.982
Oh, comedian. Yeah.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.150
Oh. You're on next.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.319
What do you mean, next? I'm...

14:23.487 --> 14:25.488
You're on right after this act.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.991
No, it can't be. Because he's a comic.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.117
Yes.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.328
- You're putting on two comics in a row?
- Why not?

14:32.496 --> 14:35.915
No, I'm sorry. I don't wanna go on
after another comedian.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.041
It's OK.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.211
No. Because they're laughing.
So I'd... rather not.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.755
Will you relax? They're gonna love you.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.884
I'd prefer not to. Look.
They're laughing at him.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.761
They're gonna laugh at him
then I gotta go out.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.723
I gotta get laughs too.
How much can they laugh?

14:51.891 --> 14:54.601
- They're laughed out.
- Do you feel all right?

14:54.768 --> 14:56.853
Jesus!

14:57.688 --> 14:59.105
What's your name?

14:59.273 --> 15:00.815
Allison.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.066
Yeah?

15:02.234 --> 15:03.318
Allison what?

15:03.485 --> 15:04.652
Portchnik.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.155
Portchnik?

15:07.323 --> 15:09.324
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.576
Allison Portchnik!

15:12.202 --> 15:16.497
So, what are you telling me? You work
for Stevenson all the time or what?

15:16.665 --> 15:19.417
No, no, no.
I'm in the midst of doing my thesis.

15:19.585 --> 15:20.710
On what?

15:20.878 --> 15:24.005
Political Commitment
in 20th-Century Literature.

15:24.173 --> 15:28.051
You're like... New York, Jewish,
left-wing, liberal, intellectual...

15:28.218 --> 15:32.055
...Central Park West, Brandeis University,
socialist summer camps?

15:32.222 --> 15:36.225
The father with the Ben Shahn drawings?
The really strike-oriented...

15:36.393 --> 15:39.604
Stop me before I make
a complete imbecile of myself.

15:39.772 --> 15:44.150
No. That was wonderful. I love
being reduced to a cultural stereotype.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.362
Right. I'm a bigot. But for the Left.

15:49.740 --> 15:53.534
I have to go out there.
Say something encouraging. Quickly.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.662
I think you're cute.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.830
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.083
Go ahead.

16:09.885 --> 16:13.763
I don't know why they would have me
at this kind of rally cos...

16:13.931 --> 16:17.350
...I'm not essentially
a political comedian at all.

16:17.518 --> 16:22.063
I interestingly had, um... dated a woman...

16:22.231 --> 16:25.191
...in the Eisenhower administration briefly.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.443
And it was ironic to me cos, um...

16:28.404 --> 16:30.697
Cos I was trying to do to her...

16:30.864 --> 16:35.326
...what Eisenhower has been doing
to the country for the last eight years.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.582
I'm sorry. I can't go through with this.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.919
I can't get it off my mind, Allison.
It's obsessing me.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.839
I'm getting tired of it.
I need your attention.

16:48.007 --> 16:52.051
But it doesn't make any sense.
He drove past the book depository...

16:52.219 --> 16:55.847
...and the police said conclusively
that it was an exit wound.

16:56.015 --> 17:00.184
So how is it possible for Oswald
to have fired from two angles at once?

17:00.352 --> 17:02.520
- It doesn't make sense!
- Alvy...

17:03.439 --> 17:06.691
I'll tell you this.
He was not marksman enough...

17:06.858 --> 17:09.277
...to hit a moving target at that range.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.237
But...

17:11.405 --> 17:13.656
...if there was a second assassin...

17:13.824 --> 17:16.242
- That's it!
- We've been through this.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.119
They recovered the shells from that rifle.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.289
OK. What are you saying now?

17:21.457 --> 17:25.792
Everybody on the Warren Commission
is in on this conspiracy, right?

17:25.961 --> 17:27.252
Well, why not?

17:27.421 --> 17:28.671
Yeah. Earl Warren?

17:28.839 --> 17:31.174
Hey, honey. I don't know Earl Warren.

17:31.341 --> 17:33.342
Lyndon Johnson?

17:33.510 --> 17:37.847
Lyndon Johnson is a politician!
You know the ethics those guys have.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.892
It's like a notch
underneath child molester.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.561
Then everybody's in on the conspiracy.

17:43.729 --> 17:48.066
The FBI and the CIA
and J Edgar Hoover and oil companies...

17:48.233 --> 17:52.528
...and the Pentagon and the men's room
attendant at the White House.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.406
I would leave out
the men's room attendant.

17:55.574 --> 18:00.661
You're using this conspiracy theory
as an excuse to avoid sex with me.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.497
Oh, my God!

18:02.664 --> 18:04.207
She's right.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.417
Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik?

18:06.585 --> 18:10.046
She was beautiful, she was willing,
she was real intelligent.

18:10.214 --> 18:14.801
Is it the old Groucho Marxjoke that
I just don't wanna belong to any club...

18:14.968 --> 18:17.887
...that would have
someone like me for a member?

18:18.055 --> 18:20.056
Alvy, don't panic! Please stop it!

18:20.224 --> 18:23.059
It's a mistake to ever bring
a live thing in the house.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.228
Stop it! Go for that one there.

18:25.395 --> 18:29.065
Maybe we should call the police.
Dial 911. It's the lobster squad.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.734
They're only baby ones, for God's sakes.

18:31.902 --> 18:35.238
- If they're only babies, you pick 'em up.
- All right! All right!

18:35.405 --> 18:37.865
- Here you go!
- Don't give it to me! Don't!

18:38.033 --> 18:40.827
Look! One crawled
behind the refrigerator.

18:40.994 --> 18:42.995
It'll turn up in our bed at night.

18:43.163 --> 18:46.124
Will you get out of here
with that thing? Jesus!

18:46.291 --> 18:48.459
Talk to 'em. You speak shellfish.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.254
Hey, look. Put it in the pot.

18:51.421 --> 18:55.216
I can't put it in the pot!
I can't put a live thing in hot water!

18:55.384 --> 18:58.177
You think we're gonna
take him to the movies?

18:58.345 --> 19:00.263
Oh, good, Alvy. Oh, thank you.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.890
OK. It's in. It's definitely in the pot.

19:03.058 --> 19:06.477
Annie, there's a big lobster
behind the refrigerator.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.855
I can't get it out. This thing's heavy.

19:09.022 --> 19:13.234
Maybe if I put a dish of butter sauce here
with a nutcracker, it'll run out.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.403
I'm gonna get my camera.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.655
I think if I could pry the door off...

19:17.823 --> 19:21.159
We should have gotten steaks.
They don't run around.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.162
Goddamn it! Oh, jeez!

19:24.329 --> 19:26.747
Pick this lobster up. Hold it, please.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.916
You're gonna take pictures now?

19:29.084 --> 19:31.502
Alvy, it'll be wonderful. Oh, lovely!

19:31.670 --> 19:33.671
Oh, God! That's disgusting!

19:33.839 --> 19:35.590
One more, Alvy. Please!

19:35.757 --> 19:37.383
Oh, good! Good!

19:37.551 --> 19:40.970
Here's what I want to know.
Am I your first big romance?

19:41.138 --> 19:42.722
Oh, no. No, no. Uh-uh.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.140
Really? Who was?

19:44.308 --> 19:47.476
There was Dennis
from Chippewa Falls High School.

19:47.644 --> 19:51.606
Dennis? Local kid? Would
meet you in front of the movie house?

19:51.773 --> 19:54.525
You should have seen
how I looked then.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.361
Oh, I can imagine.
The wife of an astronaut.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.614
Then there was Jerry, the actor.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.782
Look at you. You're such a clown.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.451
I look pretty.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.995
You always look pretty. But that guy...

20:06.163 --> 20:10.208
Acting is like an exploration of the soul.
It's very religious.

20:10.375 --> 20:14.003
Like a kind of liberating consciousness.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.255
It's like a visual poem.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.466
Is he kidding with that crap?

20:18.634 --> 20:20.635
Oh, right.

20:20.802 --> 20:24.513
I think I know exactly what you mean
when you say "religious".

20:24.681 --> 20:25.640
You do?

20:25.807 --> 20:29.143
- Oh, come on. I was younger.
- Hey, that was last year.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.312
It's like when I think of dying.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.898
- You know how I'd like to die?
- No. How?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.692
I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.861
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels!

20:39.029 --> 20:43.866
Listen, he was a terrific actor.
He's neat-looking and he was emotional...

20:44.034 --> 20:46.494
I don't think you like emotion too much.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.829
Touch my heart... with your foot.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.499
I may throw up.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.668
He was creepy.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.545
I think you're pretty lucky
I came along.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.923
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.760
If anyone had ever told me
I would be taking out a girl...

21:02.928 --> 21:05.471
...who used expressions like la-de-da...

21:05.639 --> 21:08.391
You really like
those New York girls.

21:08.558 --> 21:12.395
- Well, not just. Not only.
- I'd say so. You married two of them.

21:12.562 --> 21:16.274
There's Henry Drucker.
He has a chair in history at Princeton.

21:16.441 --> 21:20.653
The short man is Hershel Kaminsky.
He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.155
Two more chairs,
they got a dining room set.

21:23.323 --> 21:26.617
- Why are you so hostile?
- Cos I wanna watch the Knicks on TV.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.786
Is that Paul Goodman? No.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.206
Be nice to the host,
because he's publishing my book.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.708
Hi, Doug!

21:33.875 --> 21:37.461
Douglas Wyatt. The Foul
Rag and Bone Shop of the Heart.

21:37.629 --> 21:42.049
I'm so tired of making fake insights
with people who work for Dysentery.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.259
Commentary.

21:43.427 --> 21:48.097
Really? I heard Commentary and Dissent
had merged and formed Dysentery.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.349
No jokes. These are friends, OK?

21:54.396 --> 21:56.689
Here you are.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.858
There's people out there.

21:59.026 --> 22:04.155
Two minutes ago the Knicks are ahead 14
points, and now they're ahead two points.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.324
Alvy...

22:06.491 --> 22:10.202
What is so fascinating
about a group of pituitary cases...

22:10.370 --> 22:12.830
...trying to stuff a ball through a hoop?

22:12.998 --> 22:15.333
What is fascinating is that it's physical.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.586
Intellectuals prove
you can be absolutely brilliant...

22:18.754 --> 22:20.755
...and have no idea what's going on.

22:20.922 --> 22:24.425
But, on the other hand,
the body doesn't lie...

22:24.593 --> 22:26.594
...as we now know.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.304
Stop acting out.

22:28.472 --> 22:33.559
It'll be great. All those PhDs are in there
discussing modes of alienation...

22:33.727 --> 22:36.228
...and we'll be in here quietly humping.

22:36.396 --> 22:40.441
Alvy, don't.
You're using sex to express hostility.

22:40.609 --> 22:45.196
Why do you always reduce my animal
urges to psychoanalytic categories?

22:45.364 --> 22:47.782
He said, as he removed her brassiere.

22:49.117 --> 22:53.371
Alvy! There are people out there
from The New Yorker magazine!

22:54.289 --> 22:55.831
Oh, my God.

22:55.999 --> 22:58.084
What would they think?

23:04.341 --> 23:05.508
Damn siren!

23:05.675 --> 23:06.842
OK. Don't get upset.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.011
Dammit! I was so close!

23:09.179 --> 23:13.557
Last night it was a guy honking
his car horn. The city can't close down.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.644
You wanna have them
shut down the airport too?

23:16.812 --> 23:18.896
No more flights so we can have sex?

23:19.064 --> 23:21.065
I'm too tense. I need a Valium.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.860
My analyst says I should live
in the country and not in New York.

23:25.028 --> 23:28.531
We can't have this discussion.
The country makes me nervous.

23:28.698 --> 23:32.118
You've got crickets.
There's no place to walk after dinner.

23:32.285 --> 23:34.787
The screens
with the dead moths behind 'em.

23:34.955 --> 23:38.582
You got the Manson family, possibly.
You got Dick and Terry.

23:38.750 --> 23:43.421
OK! OK! My analyst just thinks I'm
too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?

23:43.588 --> 23:45.756
It's quiet now. We can start again.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.925
I can't. My head is throbbing.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.553
- You got a headache?
- I have a headache.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.679
Bad?

23:51.847 --> 23:53.931
- Like Oswald in Ghosts.
- Jesus!

23:54.099 --> 23:56.517
Where are you going?

23:56.810 --> 23:59.937
I'm going to take another
in a series of cold showers.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.773
Max, my serve will send you
to the showers early.

24:02.941 --> 24:07.236
The failure of the country to get behind
New York City is anti-Semitism.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.405
Max, the city is terribly run.

24:09.573 --> 24:13.033
I'm not discussing politics or economics.
This is foreskin.

24:13.201 --> 24:17.413
Every time some group disagrees
with you, it's because of anti-Semitism.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.790
The rest of the country sees New York...

24:19.958 --> 24:23.711
...as left-wing, Communist, Jewish,
homosexual pornographers.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.464
I think of us that way sometimes,
and I live here.

24:26.631 --> 24:31.051
Max, if we lived in California, we could
play outdoors every day in the sun.

24:31.219 --> 24:35.014
Sun is bad for you. Everything
our parents said was good is bad.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.183
Sun, milk, red meat, college.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.642
I know, but I...

24:38.810 --> 24:40.811
Egad. Here he comes.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.062
OK.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.231
Hi!

24:44.399 --> 24:46.567
You know Alvy? This is Janet.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.736
This is Annie Hall.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.279
This is Alvy.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.239
Who's playing with who?

24:52.407 --> 24:54.408
You and me against them?

24:54.576 --> 24:58.078
- I can't play too good, you know?
- I've had four lessons.

25:08.882 --> 25:09.924
Oh! Yeah!

25:12.427 --> 25:13.469
Hi!

25:14.095 --> 25:15.763
Hi. Hi.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.641
Oh, hi. Hi.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.811
Well...

25:22.979 --> 25:25.064
Bye.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.151
You play very well.

25:29.319 --> 25:31.320
Oh, yeah? So do you.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.073
Oh, God. What a dumb thing to say, right?

25:34.241 --> 25:39.036
You say, "You play well" and then
right away I have to say, "You play well."

25:39.204 --> 25:40.454
Oh!

25:40.622 --> 25:42.540
God, Annie. Well...

25:42.707 --> 25:44.542
Oh, well.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.710
La-de-da. La-de-da.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.212
La-la. Yeah.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.297
You want a lift?

25:50.465 --> 25:52.675
Oh, why?

25:52.842 --> 25:54.843
You got a car?

25:55.011 --> 25:57.763
Me? No. I was gonna take a cab.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.432
Oh, no. I have a car.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.476
You have a car?

26:03.436 --> 26:06.480
I don't understand.
If you have a car, so then...

26:06.648 --> 26:10.859
...why did you say, "Do you have a car?"
Like you wanted a lift?

26:11.027 --> 26:13.028
I don't... I don't...

26:13.196 --> 26:15.281
Jeez, I don't know. I wasn't...

26:17.075 --> 26:19.243
It's... I've got this VW out there.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.705
What a jerk! Yeah.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.957
Would you like a lift?

26:25.417 --> 26:27.418
Sure. Which way are you going?

26:27.586 --> 26:29.587
Me? Downtown.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.755
I'm going uptown.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.258
Well, you know, I'm going uptown too.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.844
You just said you were going downtown.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.137
Sorry.

26:38.305 --> 26:41.432
I can go uptown too.
I live uptown, but what the hell!

26:41.600 --> 26:44.685
It'll be nice having company.
I hate driving alone.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.896
So where do you know Janet from?

26:48.064 --> 26:50.941
- I'm in her acting class.
- You're an actress?

26:51.109 --> 26:53.110
Well, I do commercials, sort of.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.782
- You're not from New York, right?
- Chippewa Falls.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.827
- Where?
- Wisconsin.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.996
You're driving a tad rapidly.

27:04.164 --> 27:07.041
Don't worry.
I'm a very good driver. I'm good.

27:07.208 --> 27:09.835
- You want some gum anyway?
- No. No, thanks.

27:10.003 --> 27:13.547
Hey, don't... No, no.
Would you watch the road? I'll get it!

27:15.592 --> 27:17.926
- I'll get you a piece.
- So, you drive?

27:18.094 --> 27:21.055
Do I drive? No.
I've got a problem with driving.

27:21.222 --> 27:23.223
Oh, you do?

27:23.391 --> 27:26.852
I've got a licence,
but I have too much hostility.

27:27.812 --> 27:30.356
Nice car. You keep it nice.

27:30.523 --> 27:32.524
Can I ask you? Is this a sandwich?

27:32.692 --> 27:34.151
Huh? Oh, yeah.

27:39.199 --> 27:42.993
I live over here. Oh, my God! Look!
There's a parking space.

27:48.124 --> 27:50.918
That's OK.
We can walk to the kerb from here.

27:52.295 --> 27:55.089
- You want your tennis stuff?
- Huh? Oh. Yeah.

27:55.256 --> 27:57.424
That's good. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.677
Well...

28:01.388 --> 28:02.805
Thank you.

28:02.972 --> 28:05.516
You're a wonderful tennis player and...

28:05.684 --> 28:08.936
...you're the worst driver
I've ever seen in my life.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.272
Anyplace. Europe.
The United... Anyplace. Asia.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.609
- And I love what you're wearing.
- Oh, you do, yeah?

28:15.777 --> 28:19.446
Oh, well, it's a...
This tie is a present from Grammy Hall.

28:19.614 --> 28:21.615
Who? Grammy... Grammy Hall?

28:21.783 --> 28:22.950
Yeah, my grammy.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.994
Did you grow up
in a Norman Rockwell painting?

28:26.162 --> 28:29.415
- Your grammy?
- I know. It's pretty silly, isn't it?

28:29.582 --> 28:34.169
My grammy never gave gifts. She was
too busy getting raped by Cossacks.

28:34.671 --> 28:35.879
Well...

28:36.047 --> 28:38.048
- Thank you again.
- Oh, yeah.

28:38.216 --> 28:42.428
Hey, you wanna come upstairs
and have a glass of wine or something?

28:42.595 --> 28:45.681
I mean, you don't have to.
You're probably late.

28:45.849 --> 28:48.726
No, no. That'd be fine.
I wouldn't mind. Sure.

28:48.893 --> 28:52.938
I've got time. I've got nothing...
till my analyst appointment.

28:53.106 --> 28:55.107
Oh, you see an analyst?

28:55.275 --> 28:57.609
- Yeah. Just for 15 years.
- 15 years?!

28:57.777 --> 29:01.655
I'm gonna give him one more year
and then I'm going to Lourdes.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.657
15... Nah! Come on!

29:03.825 --> 29:04.908
Yeah? Really?

29:05.076 --> 29:08.454
Sylvia Plath? Interesting poetess
whose tragic suicide...

29:08.621 --> 29:12.499
...was misinterpreted as romantic
by the college-girl mentality.

29:12.667 --> 29:13.625
Oh, sorry.

29:13.793 --> 29:16.628
I don't know.
Some of her poems seem neat.

29:16.796 --> 29:19.131
Neat? I hate to tell you, this is 1975.

29:19.299 --> 29:22.801
"Neat" went out, I would say,
at the turn of the century.

29:22.969 --> 29:24.970
Who are those photos on the wall?

29:25.138 --> 29:28.390
Oh! Well, you see now, uh...
That's my dad.

29:28.558 --> 29:31.351
That's Father.
And that's my brother Duane.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.520
- Duane?
- Yeah, right. Duane.

29:33.688 --> 29:36.648
And over there is Grammy Hall.
And that's Sadie.

29:36.816 --> 29:39.777
- Who's Sadie?
- Oh, well, Sadie... Ha, ha.

29:39.944 --> 29:43.197
Sadie met Grammy
through Grammy's brother George.

29:43.364 --> 29:46.074
George was real sweet.
He had that thing...

29:46.242 --> 29:51.205
What is that thing where you fall asleep
in the middle of a sentence? What is it?

29:51.372 --> 29:53.624
- Narcolepsy.
- Narcolepsy! Right!

29:53.792 --> 29:58.420
So anyway, um... George went to
the union, you see, to get his free turkey.

29:58.588 --> 30:02.633
The union always gave George
this free turkey at Christmas time...

30:02.801 --> 30:06.094
...because he was shell-shocked
in the First World War.

30:06.262 --> 30:11.975
Anyway, so George is standing in line -
oh, just a sec - getting his free turkey.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.853
But the thing is, is that he falls asleep...

30:15.021 --> 30:17.022
...and he never wakes up!

30:17.190 --> 30:19.733
So... so he's dead!

30:19.901 --> 30:21.985
He's dead. Yeah.

30:22.862 --> 30:24.112
Oh, dear.

30:24.280 --> 30:28.784
Well... Terrible, huh? Wouldn't you say?
I mean, that's pretty awful.

30:28.952 --> 30:32.037
It's a great story, though.
It really made my day.

30:32.205 --> 30:35.707
I think I should get outta here
cos I think I'm imposing.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.668
Really? Well, maybe, um...

30:37.836 --> 30:38.794
You know, I...

30:38.962 --> 30:43.090
- You don't have to, you know.
- I'm all perspired and everything.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.425
Didn't you take a shower at the club?

30:45.593 --> 30:48.303
Me? No. Cos I never shower
in a public place.

30:48.471 --> 30:49.721
Why not?

30:49.889 --> 30:53.225
Cos I don't like to get naked
in front of another man.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.686
Oh, I see. I see.

30:55.854 --> 30:59.022
I don't like to show my body
to a man of my gender.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.608
You never know what's gonna happen.

31:01.776 --> 31:04.570
- 15 years, huh?
- 15 years, yeah. That's...

31:05.864 --> 31:07.948
God bless.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.787
Well... well...

31:15.373 --> 31:18.500
You're what Grammy Hall
would call "a real Jew".

31:20.795 --> 31:22.588
Thank you.

31:22.755 --> 31:26.884
Yeah, well, she hates Jews.
She thinks that they just make money.

31:27.051 --> 31:30.178
But she's the one.
Is she ever! I'm tellin' you.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.728
So did you do those photographs
in there or what?

31:38.771 --> 31:42.691
Yeah. I sort of dabble around,
you know. I dabble?

31:42.859 --> 31:47.070
They're wonderful, you know.
They have a... a quality.

31:47.238 --> 31:51.283
Well, I would like to take
a serious photography course.

31:51.451 --> 31:54.536
Photography's interesting
cos it's a new art form...

31:54.704 --> 31:57.706
...and a set of aesthetic criteria
have not emerged yet.

31:57.874 --> 31:58.874
Aesthetic criteria?

31:59.042 --> 32:01.585
You mean whether it's
a good photo or not?

32:01.753 --> 32:06.673
The medium enters in as a
condition of the art form itself.

32:06.841 --> 32:11.094
Well... to me... I mean,
it's... it's... it's all instinctive.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.597
I just try to feel it.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.683
I try to get a sense of it
and not think about it so much.

32:16.851 --> 32:21.480
Still, you need a set of aesthetic
guidelines to put it in social perspective.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.524
Well, I don't know.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.944
I guess you must be sort of late, huh?

32:27.111 --> 32:31.490
You know, I gotta get there
and begin whining soon. Otherwise I...

32:32.075 --> 32:34.493
- Hey, are you busy Friday night?
- Me?

32:35.036 --> 32:37.037
Oh, uh, no.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.206
Oh, I'm sorry! I have something.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.458
What about Saturday night?

32:42.627 --> 32:44.628
Nothing. No, no.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.880
You're very popular, I can see.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.800
- I know.
- Do you have plague?

32:49.968 --> 32:52.052
Well, I mean, I meet a lot ofjerks.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.930
I meet a lot ofjerks too.
I think that's a...

32:55.098 --> 32:57.724
But I'm thinking about getting some cats.

32:57.892 --> 33:00.018
Oh, wait a second. Oh, no, no!

33:00.186 --> 33:02.980
Oh, shoot! No. Saturday night I'm gonna...

33:03.773 --> 33:05.774
I'm gonna sing. Yeah.

33:05.942 --> 33:08.652
You're gonna sing?
Do you sing? No kidding?

33:08.820 --> 33:12.406
- This is my first time.
- Really? Where? I'd like to come.

33:12.573 --> 33:15.117
- Oh, no. No, no, no, no!
- I'm interested.

33:15.284 --> 33:18.620
I'm just... I'm auditioning
at this club. I don't...

33:18.788 --> 33:22.749
- It's my first time.
- It's OK. I know exactly what that's like.

33:22.917 --> 33:26.670
You're gonna like nightclubs.
They're really a lot of fun.

33:31.884 --> 33:34.344
<i>~ It had to be you ~</i>

33:37.515 --> 33:44.312
<i>~ It had to be you ~</i>

33:45.857 --> 33:48.025
<i>~ I wandered around ~</i>

33:48.192 --> 33:50.485
<i>~ And finally found ~</i>

33:50.653 --> 33:55.657
<i>~ The somebody who ~</i>

33:58.244 --> 34:03.707
<i>~ Could make me be true ~</i>

34:03.875 --> 34:09.170
<i>~ Could make me be blue ~</i>

34:11.132 --> 34:14.592
<i>- <i>~ And even be glad ~</i></i>

34:14.761 --> 34:16.928
<i>~ Just to be sad ~</i>

34:17.096 --> 34:24.186
<i>~ Thinking of you ~</i>

34:24.353 --> 34:26.772
I was awful! I'm so ashamed! I can't sing!

34:26.938 --> 34:29.065
So the audience was a tad restless.

34:29.233 --> 34:32.110
What do you mean, a tad restless?
They hated me!

34:32.277 --> 34:34.780
They didn't! You have a wonderful voice!

34:34.947 --> 34:38.366
- I'm gonna quit.
- I won't let you. You have a great voice.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.953
- Really? Do you think so? Really?
- Yeah. It's terrific.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.246
I never even took a lesson, either.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.416
Hey, listen. Give me a kiss.

34:46.583 --> 34:49.753
- Really?
- Because we're just gonna go home later.

34:49.920 --> 34:54.841
There's gonna be all that tension and I
won't know when to make the right move.

34:55.009 --> 34:58.512
So we'll kiss now,
we'll get it over with and then go eat.

34:58.679 --> 35:01.014
- We'll digest our food better.
- OK.

35:02.475 --> 35:05.727
OK? So now we can digest our food.

35:05.895 --> 35:08.230
I'm gonna have the corned beef, please.

35:08.397 --> 35:11.274
Oh. I'm gonna have pastrami
on white bread...

35:11.442 --> 35:14.402
...with mayonnaise
and tomatoes and lettuce.

35:17.073 --> 35:22.160
So, um... your second wife left you.
And were you depressed about that?

35:22.328 --> 35:25.455
Nothing that a few megavitamins
couldn't cure.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.542
And your first wife? Allison?

35:28.709 --> 35:33.255
She was nice, but... That was my fault.
I was just... I was too crazy.

35:33.422 --> 35:35.507
Mm... Mm...

35:36.551 --> 35:38.552
That was so nice.

35:38.719 --> 35:40.720
That was nice.

35:40.888 --> 35:43.765
As Balzac said,
"There goes another novel."

35:45.852 --> 35:47.853
- You were great.
- Oh.

35:48.020 --> 35:50.021
Yeah? Yeah?

35:50.189 --> 35:52.274
Yeah. I'm wrecked.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.402
- You're wrecked!
- I mean it.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.737
I will never play the piano again.

35:58.823 --> 36:02.242
It was... I don't know.
You really thought it was good?

36:02.410 --> 36:04.411
Good? Yes.

36:04.579 --> 36:07.914
That was the most fun I've ever had
without laughing.

36:08.082 --> 36:10.083
Here. You want some?

36:10.251 --> 36:14.880
No. I... I don't... use
any major hallucinogenics because I...

36:15.047 --> 36:18.300
...took a puff
about five years ago at a party and...

36:18.467 --> 36:19.593
Yeah?

36:19.760 --> 36:22.179
Tried to take my pants off over my head.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.931
Got in one ear.

36:25.099 --> 36:28.143
Well, I don't really...
I don't do it very often.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.395
It just sort of relaxes me.

36:32.773 --> 36:36.151
- You're not gonna believe this, but...
- What? What?

36:39.113 --> 36:43.158
I'm gonna buy you these books
because I think you should read them.

36:43.326 --> 36:47.245
- Instead of that cat book.
- That's pretty serious stuff there.

36:47.413 --> 36:51.333
Yeah. Cos I'm obsessed with death,
I think. Big subject with me.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.752
I have a very pessimistic view of life.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.379
You should know this
if we're gonna go out.

36:56.547 --> 37:00.550
I feel that life is divided up
into the horrible and the miserable.

37:00.718 --> 37:05.222
Those are the two categories.
The horrible would be like terminal cases.

37:05.389 --> 37:09.684
And blind people. And cripples.
I don't know how they get through life.

37:09.852 --> 37:12.020
And the miserable is everyone else.

37:12.188 --> 37:15.232
So you should be thankful
that you're miserable.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.567
You're very lucky to be miserable.

37:18.861 --> 37:20.862
Look at that guy.

37:21.030 --> 37:23.114
In the pink. Mr Miami Beach there.

37:23.282 --> 37:26.701
He's just come back
from the gin rummy finals.

37:26.869 --> 37:28.662
Placed third.

37:28.829 --> 37:33.708
Look at these guys. They're back from
Fire Island. They're giving it a chance.

37:33.876 --> 37:37.212
- Italian, right?
- Him? Yeah, he's the Mafia.

37:37.380 --> 37:41.091
Linen supply business
or cement and contracting, I think.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.593
"Oh, gee!
Must have my moustache waxed."

37:43.761 --> 37:47.639
There's the winner
of the Truman Capote lookalike contest.

37:47.848 --> 37:50.475
You are extremely sexy.
Unbelievably sexy.

37:50.643 --> 37:52.644
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

37:52.812 --> 37:56.314
You know what you are?
You're polymorphously perverse.

37:56.482 --> 37:59.276
What does that mean?
I don't know what that is.

37:59.443 --> 38:02.862
You're exceptional in bed
because you get pleasure...

38:03.030 --> 38:07.284
...in every part of your body when
I touch you. Like the tip of your nose.

38:07.451 --> 38:11.538
If I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps,
you suddenly get excited.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.707
You know what? I like you.

38:13.874 --> 38:15.875
I really do like you.

38:16.043 --> 38:18.503
Do you love me? That's the key question.

38:18.671 --> 38:21.214
I know you've only known me
a short while.

38:21.382 --> 38:24.676
I think that's sort of...
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.845
Do you love me?

38:27.013 --> 38:30.724
Love is... too weak a word for...
the way I feel.

38:30.891 --> 38:33.393
I lurve you. You know, I loave you.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.521
I luff you. With two Fs.
Yes, I have to invent...

38:36.689 --> 38:38.857
Of course I do. Don't you think I do?

38:39.025 --> 38:41.109
I don't know.

38:43.362 --> 38:45.905
You're not gonna give up
your apartment, are you?

38:46.073 --> 38:47.032
Of course.

38:47.199 --> 38:49.200
- But why?
- I'm moving in with you.

38:49.368 --> 38:52.954
- But you've got a nice apartment.
- I have a tiny apartment.

38:53.122 --> 38:56.458
- I know it's small.
- And it's got bad plumbing and bugs.

38:56.625 --> 39:01.379
Granted. It has bad plumbing and bugs.
You say that like it's a negative thing.

39:01.547 --> 39:05.425
You know, bugs are...
Entomology is a rapidly growing field.

39:05.593 --> 39:09.721
- You don't want me to live with you.
- I don't want you to live with me?

39:09.889 --> 39:11.890
- Whose idea was it?
- Mine.

39:12.058 --> 39:15.477
It was yours, actually.
But I approved it immediately.

39:15.644 --> 39:18.688
I guess you think
I talked you into something, huh?

39:18.856 --> 39:22.233
No! We live together,
we sleep together, we eat together.

39:22.401 --> 39:25.695
Jesus! You don't want it to be
like we're married, do you?

39:25.863 --> 39:29.366
- How is it any different?
- Cos you keep your own apartment.

39:29.533 --> 39:32.702
We don't have to go to it.
We don't have to deal with it.

39:32.870 --> 39:37.290
It's like a free-floating life raft.
That we know that we're not married.

39:37.458 --> 39:40.085
That little apartment
is $400 a month, Alvy.

39:40.252 --> 39:42.712
- That place is $400 a month?
- Yes, it is.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.881
It's got bad plumbing and bugs.

39:45.049 --> 39:50.512
Jesus! My accountant will write it off
as a tax deduction. I'll pay for it.

39:50.679 --> 39:54.974
- You don't think I'm smart enough.
- Hey, don't be ridiculous.

39:55.142 --> 39:59.229
Then why are you always pushing me
to take college courses like I was dumb?

39:59.397 --> 40:01.523
Adult education's a wonderful thing.

40:01.690 --> 40:04.943
You meet interesting professors.
It's stimulating.

40:17.581 --> 40:19.749
Does this sound like a good course?

40:19.917 --> 40:22.001
"Modern American Poetry"?

40:22.628 --> 40:25.171
Or let's see now. Maybe I should take...

40:25.923 --> 40:27.924
..."Introduction to the Novel".

40:28.092 --> 40:31.886
Just don't take any course
where they make you read Beowulf.

40:32.054 --> 40:33.596
What?

40:33.764 --> 40:38.518
Hey, what do you think? You think we
should go to that party in Southampton?

40:38.686 --> 40:41.729
Don't be silly.
What do we need other people for?

40:41.897 --> 40:46.484
We should just turn out the lights
and play hide the salami or something.

40:46.652 --> 40:49.446
Well, listen,
I'm gonna get a cigarette, OK?

40:49.613 --> 40:54.868
Grass, right? The illusion that it will make
a white woman more like Billie Holiday.

40:55.035 --> 40:57.829
- Well, have you ever made love high?
- Me? No.

40:57.997 --> 41:02.292
If I have grass or alcohol or anything,
I get unbearably wonderful.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.461
I get too wonderful for words.

41:04.628 --> 41:08.173
I don't know why you have to get high
every time we make love.

41:08.340 --> 41:12.093
- Well, it relaxes me.
- You have to be artificially relaxed...

41:12.261 --> 41:15.346
...before we can go to bed?
- What's the difference?

41:15.514 --> 41:19.017
Take a shot of Sodium Pentothal.
You can sleep through it.

41:19.185 --> 41:22.103
You've been seeing a psychiatrist
for15 years.

41:22.271 --> 41:25.398
You should smoke this.
You'd be off the couch in no time.

41:25.566 --> 41:28.401
- Come on. You don't need that.
- What are you doing?

41:28.569 --> 41:31.738
- No, Alvy. Please.
- You can live without it once.

41:33.782 --> 41:35.867
Wait. I got a great idea.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.996
Hang in there for a second.
I got a little artefact.

41:40.164 --> 41:43.875
A little erotic artefact
that I brought up from the city...

41:44.043 --> 41:46.294
...which I think is gonna be perfect.

41:46.462 --> 41:49.714
There. Create a little
old New Orleans essence.

41:49.882 --> 41:52.342
Now we can go about our business here...

41:52.510 --> 41:55.470
...and even develop photographs
if we want to.

42:03.229 --> 42:05.772
- Hey, is something wrong?
- No. Why?

42:05.940 --> 42:08.525
I don't know. It's like you're removed.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.693
No, I'm fine.

42:10.861 --> 42:12.946
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

42:13.113 --> 42:15.907
I don't know. You seem sorta distant.

42:16.075 --> 42:18.076
Let's just do it, all right?

42:18.244 --> 42:21.621
Is it my imagination or are you just
going through the motions?

42:21.789 --> 42:23.998
Do you remember
where I put my drawing pad?

42:24.166 --> 42:27.502
While you two are doing that,
I think I'm gonna do some drawing.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.755
- That's what I call removed.
- Oh, you have my body.

42:30.923 --> 42:33.383
Yeah, but I want the whole thing.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.760
Well, I need grass.

42:35.928 --> 42:38.388
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass.

42:38.556 --> 42:42.058
I'm a comedian. If I get a laugh
from a person who's high...

42:42.226 --> 42:45.270
...it doesn't count,
cos they're always laughing.

42:45.437 --> 42:48.606
- Were you always funny?
- What is this? An interview?

42:48.774 --> 42:50.858
We're supposed to be making love.

42:51.026 --> 42:54.237
This guy is naturally funny.
I think he can write for you.

42:54.405 --> 42:57.448
Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid,
he tells me you're really good.

42:57.616 --> 42:59.617
Let me explain how I work.

42:59.785 --> 43:03.162
I don't look like a funny guy
like some of the guys that come out.

43:03.330 --> 43:05.331
You know you're gonna fall down.

43:05.499 --> 43:10.169
But material's gotta be sensational for me.
I work with very... I'm kinda classy.

43:10.337 --> 43:13.673
Let me explain. For instance,
I open with an opening song.

43:13.841 --> 43:17.093
Musical style like
<i>~ Bam da dam da da da ~</i> and I walk out...

43:17.261 --> 43:19.262
<i>~ Place looks wonderful from here ~</i>

43:19.430 --> 43:21.639
<i>~ And you folks look</i>
<i>wonderful from here ~</i>

43:21.807 --> 43:24.350
<i>~ And seeing you there</i>
<i>with a smile on your face ~</i>

43:24.518 --> 43:26.686
<i>~ Makes me shout</i>
<i>"This must be the place" ~</i>

43:26.854 --> 43:29.731
Then I open with some jokes.
That's where I need you.

43:29.898 --> 43:33.526
"I just got back from Canada.
They speak a lot of French up there."

43:33.694 --> 43:38.197
"The word to remember is Jeanne d'Arc.
It means the light's out in the bathroom."

43:38.365 --> 43:40.366
"I met a big lumberjack..."

43:40.534 --> 43:42.577
Jesus! This guy's pathetic.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.746
Look at him mincing around.

43:44.913 --> 43:47.790
He thinks he's real cute.
You wanna throw up.

43:48.667 --> 43:51.210
If only I had the nerve
to do my own jokes.

43:51.920 --> 43:56.382
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this smile frozen on my face.

43:56.550 --> 43:58.801
I'm in the wrong business. I know it.

43:58.969 --> 44:02.555
"But... um... chÃ©ri...

44:02.723 --> 44:04.807
...what will I do with this?"

44:05.142 --> 44:09.270
"Oh, Marie!
Sometime you make me so mad!"

44:09.438 --> 44:14.651
They scream at that! Write me something
like that. A French number. Can you do it?

44:20.783 --> 44:23.117
Where am I? I have to reorient myself.

44:23.285 --> 44:27.747
This is the University of Wisconsin, right?
Cos I'm always... tense...

44:27.915 --> 44:32.210
I have a very bad history with colleges.
I went to New York University.

44:32.378 --> 44:35.630
And I was thrown out of NYU
in my freshman year...

44:35.798 --> 44:38.341
...for cheating on my metaphysics final.

44:38.509 --> 44:41.844
I looked within the soul
of the boy sitting next to me.

44:44.181 --> 44:47.350
My mother,
an emotionally high-strung woman...

44:47.518 --> 44:52.271
...locked herself in the bathroom
and took an overdose of mah-jongg tiles.

44:54.608 --> 44:57.777
I was depressed at that time.
I was in analysis.

44:57.945 --> 45:01.906
I was suicidal, as a matter of fact,
and would have killed myself.

45:02.074 --> 45:04.784
But I was in analysis
with a strict Freudian.

45:04.952 --> 45:08.913
If you kill yourself, they make you pay
for the sessions you miss.

45:12.793 --> 45:16.129
Alvy, you were just great.
I'm not kidding. It was...

45:16.296 --> 45:19.799
- You were so funny.
- College audiences are wonderful.

45:19.967 --> 45:23.136
And I'm starting to get
more of the references too.

45:23.303 --> 45:27.098
Are you? Well, the 12 o'clock show's
completely different.

45:27.266 --> 45:31.853
I'm really looking forward to tomorrow.
You'll meet Mother and Father.

45:32.020 --> 45:35.022
- They'll hate me immediately.
- I don't think so.

45:35.190 --> 45:40.236
I don't think they're gonna hate you at all.
It's Easter. We'll have a nice dinner.

45:40.404 --> 45:42.780
I think they're gonna really like you.

45:51.665 --> 45:53.750
It's a nice ham this year, Mom.

45:54.835 --> 45:55.835
Oh, yeah.

45:56.003 --> 45:58.838
Grammy always does such a good job.

45:59.006 --> 46:00.757
A great sauce!

46:00.924 --> 46:03.009
It is. It's dynamite ham.

46:08.932 --> 46:10.933
We went over to the swap meet.

46:11.101 --> 46:14.896
Annie, Gram and I.
We got some nice picture frames.

46:15.063 --> 46:17.648
We really had a good time.

46:17.816 --> 46:22.862
Ann tells us that you've been seeing
a psychiatrist for 15 years.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.072
Yes. I'm making excellent progress.

46:25.240 --> 46:29.577
Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch,
I won't have to wear the lobster bib.

46:31.163 --> 46:35.374
- Duane and I went out to the boat basin.
- We were caulking holes all day.

46:35.542 --> 46:38.628
And Randolph Hunt was drunk. As usual.

46:38.796 --> 46:42.131
That Randolph Hunt.
You remember Randy Hunt, Annie.

46:42.299 --> 46:45.009
- He was in the choir with you.
- Oh, yes.

46:45.844 --> 46:48.262
I can't believe this family.

46:48.430 --> 46:51.057
Annie's mother is really beautiful.

46:51.225 --> 46:54.268
And they're talking swap meets
and boat basins.

46:54.436 --> 46:59.232
And the old lady at the end
of the table is a classic Jew-hater.

46:59.399 --> 47:04.445
They really look American. Very healthy.
Like they never get sick or anything.

47:04.613 --> 47:08.074
Nothing like my family.
The two are like oil and water.

47:08.242 --> 47:11.410
Let him drop dead.
Who needs his business?

47:11.578 --> 47:13.955
- His wife has diabetes.
- Diabetes?

47:14.122 --> 47:16.666
Is that an excuse? Diabetes?

47:16.834 --> 47:20.962
The man is 50 years old
and doesn't have a substantial job.

47:21.129 --> 47:25.508
- Is that a reason to steal from his father?
- What are you talking about?

47:25.676 --> 47:27.677
Sure! Defend him!

47:27.845 --> 47:29.846
Pass the wurst there.

47:30.013 --> 47:32.598
Mo Moskowitz, he had a coronary.

47:32.766 --> 47:34.809
You don't say!

47:34.977 --> 47:38.062
How do you plan to spend the holidays,
Mrs Singer?

47:38.230 --> 47:40.231
- We fast.
- Fast?

47:40.399 --> 47:43.150
No food. To atone for our sins.

47:43.318 --> 47:45.319
What sins? I don't understand.

47:45.487 --> 47:47.738
To tell you the truth, neither do we.

47:47.906 --> 47:49.907
Alvy.

47:50.075 --> 47:52.076
Hi, Duane. How's it goin'?

47:52.244 --> 47:54.245
This is my room.

47:54.413 --> 47:56.706
Oh, yeah? It's terrific.

47:56.874 --> 47:58.958
Can I confess something?

48:04.089 --> 48:08.301
I tell you this because,
as an artist, I think you'll understand.

48:10.262 --> 48:12.346
Sometimes when I'm driving...

48:13.223 --> 48:17.393
...on the road at night, I see
two headlights coming toward me.

48:17.561 --> 48:21.606
Fast. I have this sudden impulse
to turn the wheel quickly...

48:21.773 --> 48:23.941
...head-on into the oncoming car.

48:24.776 --> 48:27.278
I can anticipate the explosion.

48:27.946 --> 48:30.448
The sound of shattering glass. The...

48:31.408 --> 48:34.785
...flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.

48:38.373 --> 48:40.458
Right. Well...

48:41.209 --> 48:43.586
I have to go now, Duane, because I...

48:43.754 --> 48:46.380
...I'm due back on the planet Earth.

48:47.257 --> 48:49.926
- Don't let it be so long.
- Look up Uncle Billy.

48:50.093 --> 48:52.094
- He is adorable.
- Do you think so?

48:52.262 --> 48:56.849
- You're taking them to the airport?
- Duane can. I haven't finished my drink.

48:57.017 --> 48:59.894
Yes, Duane is.
Just a second. I have to get...

49:18.580 --> 49:20.748
- You followed me.
- I didn't follow you.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.124
You followed me!

49:22.292 --> 49:25.670
I was walking behind staring at you.
That's not following.

49:25.837 --> 49:28.965
- What is your definition of following?
- I was spying.

49:29.132 --> 49:33.302
- Do you realise how paranoid you are?
- You've got your arms around a guy.

49:33.470 --> 49:35.596
That is the worst kind of paranoid.

49:35.764 --> 49:39.517
I didn't start out spying.
I thought I'd pick you up after school.

49:39.685 --> 49:43.020
You wanted to keep
the relationship flexible, remember?

49:43.188 --> 49:45.815
You're having an affair
with your professor.

49:45.983 --> 49:50.528
That jerk that teaches that crap course -
Contemporary Crisis in Western Man?

49:50.696 --> 49:53.322
Existential Motifs in Russian Literature!

49:53.490 --> 49:55.491
It's all mental masturbation.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.994
We finally get to a subject
you know about.

49:58.161 --> 50:01.288
Don't knock masturbation.
It's sex with someone I love.

50:01.456 --> 50:05.626
We're not having an affair. He's married.
He just happens to think I'm neat.

50:05.794 --> 50:07.795
Neat. Are you 12 years old?

50:07.963 --> 50:10.881
- That's a Chippewa Falls expression.
- Who cares?!

50:11.049 --> 50:15.011
Next he'll find you keen and peachy.
Then he's got his hand on your ass.

50:15.178 --> 50:17.680
You've always had hostility
towards David.

50:17.848 --> 50:20.433
- You call your teacher David?
- It's his name.

50:20.600 --> 50:24.145
It's a biblical name, right?
What does he call you? Bathsheba?

50:24.312 --> 50:28.274
Alvy. Alvy, you're the one who never
wanted to make a real commitment.

50:28.442 --> 50:30.526
You don't think I'm smart enough.

50:30.694 --> 50:34.572
We had that argument just last month.
Or don't you remember?

50:35.615 --> 50:37.700
- I'm home!
- Oh, yeah? How did it go?

50:37.868 --> 50:40.953
Oh, it was really weird,
but she's a very nice woman.

50:41.121 --> 50:44.665
I didn't have to lie down on the couch.
She had me sitting up.

50:44.833 --> 50:48.294
I told her about the family
and my feelings towards men...

50:48.462 --> 50:50.838
...and my relationship with my brother.

50:51.006 --> 50:53.966
She mentioned penis envy.
Do you know about that?

50:54.134 --> 50:58.262
I'm one of the few males who suffers
from that. Go on. I'm interested.

50:58.430 --> 51:03.017
She said I was very guilty about my
impulses towards marriage and children.

51:03.185 --> 51:07.772
Then I remembered, when I was a kid, I
accidentally saw my parents making love.

51:07.939 --> 51:10.024
All this happened the first hour?

51:10.192 --> 51:13.861
I've been going for 15 years.
I don't have... nothing like that.

51:14.029 --> 51:16.113
I told her my dream and then I cried.

51:16.281 --> 51:19.658
You cried? I have never once cried.
That's fantastic.

51:19.826 --> 51:21.827
I whine. I sit and I whine.

51:21.995 --> 51:27.208
In my dream, Frank Sinatra is holding this
pillow across my face and I can't breathe.

51:27.375 --> 51:29.460
- Sinatra?
- Yeah. Strangling me.

51:29.628 --> 51:32.546
Sure. Because he's a singer
and you're a singer.

51:32.714 --> 51:36.092
It's perfect.
So you're trying to suffocate yourself.

51:36.259 --> 51:38.761
It's a perfect analytic kind of insight.

51:38.929 --> 51:41.597
She said your name was Alvy Singer.

51:42.390 --> 51:44.433
- What do you mean? Me?
- Yeah, you.

51:44.601 --> 51:47.478
Because in the dream
I break Sinatra's glasses.

51:47.646 --> 51:52.650
You never said Sinatra had glasses. What
are you saying? That I'm suffocating you?

51:52.818 --> 51:55.861
God, Alvy. I did this
really terrible thing to him.

51:56.029 --> 51:59.990
Because then, when he sang,
it was in this real high-pitched voice.

52:00.158 --> 52:02.159
What did the doctor say?

52:02.327 --> 52:04.745
I should probably come five times a week.

52:04.913 --> 52:09.750
I don't think I mind analysis at all. The
only question is, will it change my wife?

52:09.918 --> 52:11.919
- Will it change your wife?
- My life.

52:12.087 --> 52:15.965
- You said, "Will it change my wife?"
- I said, "Will it change my life?"

52:16.133 --> 52:18.134
- You said wife.
- Life! I said life.

52:18.301 --> 52:22.138
She said, "Will it change my wife?"
You heard that, so I'm not crazy.

52:22.305 --> 52:25.558
I told her I didn't think
you'd ever take me seriously...

52:25.725 --> 52:28.185
...because you don't think
I'm smart enough.

52:28.353 --> 52:30.354
Why do you always bring that up?

52:30.522 --> 52:33.774
Because I encourage you
to take adult education courses?

52:33.942 --> 52:36.652
You meet wonderful,
interesting professors.

52:36.820 --> 52:40.197
Adult education is such junk.
The professors are so phoney.

52:40.365 --> 52:43.617
I don't care what you say about David.
He's a fine teacher.

52:43.785 --> 52:45.870
And why are you following me around?

52:46.037 --> 52:48.956
- I was following you and David.
- Let's call it quits.

52:49.124 --> 52:52.376
That's fine. That's great.
I don't know what I did wrong.

52:52.544 --> 52:55.212
She cooled off to me.
Is it something that I did?

52:55.380 --> 52:59.008
It's never something you do.
That's how people are. Love fades.

52:59.176 --> 53:01.844
Love fades? God!
That's a depressing thought.

53:02.012 --> 53:05.347
I have to ask you a question.
With your wife in bed...

53:05.515 --> 53:10.102
...does she need some kind of
artificial stimulation? Like marijuana?

53:10.270 --> 53:12.271
We use a large vibrating egg.

53:12.439 --> 53:14.440
A large vibrating egg?

53:14.608 --> 53:18.319
Well, I ask a psychopath,
I get that kind of an answer. Jesus!

53:18.486 --> 53:20.946
Here. You look like a very happy couple.

53:21.114 --> 53:23.199
- Are you?
- Yeah.

53:23.366 --> 53:25.659
So how do you account for it?

53:25.827 --> 53:28.370
Uh... I'm very shallow and empty...

53:28.538 --> 53:32.833
...and I have no ideas
and nothing interesting to say.

53:33.001 --> 53:37.421
- And I'm exactly the same way.
- I see. Well, that's very interesting.

53:37.589 --> 53:40.466
So you've managed
to work out something, huh?

53:40.634 --> 53:43.177
Well, thanks very much for talking to me.

53:43.345 --> 53:47.765
Even as a kid, I always went for the
wrong women. I think that's my problem.

53:47.933 --> 53:52.269
My mother took me to see Snow White.
Everyone fell in love with Snow White.

53:52.437 --> 53:54.897
I immediately fell for the Wicked Queen.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.983
- We never have any fun any more.
- How can you say that?

53:58.151 --> 54:00.819
You're always leaning on me
to improve myself.

54:00.987 --> 54:03.280
You must be getting your period.

54:03.448 --> 54:05.950
I don't get a period!
I'm a cartoon character.

54:06.117 --> 54:08.118
Can't I be upset once in a while?

54:08.286 --> 54:11.622
Max, forget about Annie.
I know lots of women you can date.

54:11.790 --> 54:14.124
I don't wanna go out
with any other women.

54:14.292 --> 54:18.545
I have got a girl for you. You'll love her.
She's a reporter for Rolling Stone.

54:19.673 --> 54:24.468
I think there are more people here to see
the Maharishi than there were for Dylan.

54:24.636 --> 54:27.596
I covered the Dylan concert,
which gave me chills.

54:27.764 --> 54:32.351
Especially when he sang,
"She takes just like a woman."

54:33.186 --> 54:37.314
"And she makes love just like a woman.
Yes, she does."

54:38.149 --> 54:41.402
"And she aches just like a woman."

54:41.569 --> 54:44.113
"But she breaks just like a little girl."

54:44.281 --> 54:47.449
After that,
the most charismatic event I covered...

54:47.617 --> 54:50.577
...was Mick's birthday
at Madison Square Garden.

54:50.745 --> 54:54.331
- That's great. That's just great.
- Did you catch Dylan?

54:54.499 --> 54:57.835
Me? No, I couldn't make it.
My raccoon had hepatitis.

54:58.003 --> 54:59.795
You have a raccoon?

54:59.963 --> 55:01.505
A few.

55:01.673 --> 55:04.133
The only word for this is transplendid.

55:04.301 --> 55:06.302
It's transplendid.

55:06.469 --> 55:08.470
I can think of another word.

55:08.638 --> 55:11.807
He's God. This man is God.
He's got millions of followers...

55:11.975 --> 55:15.728
...who would crawl across the world
just to touch the hem of his garment.

55:15.895 --> 55:17.896
Yeah? Must be a tremendous hem.

55:18.064 --> 55:20.232
- I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
- Are you?

55:20.400 --> 55:24.486
I can't get with any religion
that advertises in Popular Mechanics.

55:24.654 --> 55:27.614
Look. There's God
coming out of the men's room.

55:27.782 --> 55:29.950
It's unbelievably transplendid!

55:30.118 --> 55:33.329
I was at the Stones concert
when they killed that guy.

55:33.496 --> 55:36.040
Were you?
I was at an Alice Cooper thing...

55:36.207 --> 55:40.169
...where six people were rushed
to the hospital with bad vibes.

55:40.879 --> 55:43.714
I hope you don't mind
that I took so long to finish.

55:44.424 --> 55:47.593
Oh, no. Don't be...
Don't be silly. You know, I...

55:48.261 --> 55:51.513
I'm starting to get
some feeling back in my jaw now.

55:53.391 --> 55:56.685
Sex with you
is really a Kafkaesque experience.

55:56.853 --> 55:58.937
Oh. Thank you.

55:59.981 --> 56:02.066
I mean that as a compliment.

56:02.609 --> 56:07.071
I think... I think there's too much burden
placed on the orgasm.

56:07.238 --> 56:10.032
You know, to make up for
empty areas in life.

56:12.118 --> 56:14.203
Who said that?

56:15.955 --> 56:19.375
I don't know. I think
it may have been Leopold and Loeb.

56:24.589 --> 56:26.673
Hello.

56:27.842 --> 56:29.843
Oh, hi!

56:30.011 --> 56:32.096
Uh... no. What...

56:32.806 --> 56:34.848
What's the matter?

56:35.016 --> 56:37.101
You sound terrible.

56:38.770 --> 56:40.854
No. Sure, I...

56:41.314 --> 56:43.315
What kind of emergency?

56:43.483 --> 56:47.194
No. Well, stay there. Stay there.
I'll come over right now.

56:47.362 --> 56:49.863
Just stay there. I'll come right over.

56:50.073 --> 56:52.074
It's me. Open up. Are you OK?

56:52.242 --> 56:54.451
What's the matter? Are you all right?

56:54.619 --> 56:56.703
There's a spider in the bathroom.

56:56.871 --> 56:57.955
What?

56:58.123 --> 57:00.916
There's a big, black spider
in the bathroom.

57:02.085 --> 57:06.588
You got me here at three in the morning
cos there's a spider in the bathroom?

57:06.756 --> 57:11.552
You know how I am about insects. I can't
sleep with a live thing crawling around.

57:11.719 --> 57:15.264
Kill it! What's wrong with you?
Don't you have a can of Raid?

57:15.432 --> 57:16.932
No.

57:17.100 --> 57:21.311
I told you a thousand times. You should
always keep a lotta insect spray.

57:21.479 --> 57:23.689
You never know who's gonna crawl over.

57:23.857 --> 57:26.525
And a first-aid kit
and a fire-extinguisher...

57:26.693 --> 57:29.111
Give me a magazine, cos I'm a little tired.

57:29.279 --> 57:32.281
You make fun of me,
but I'm prepared for anything.

57:32.449 --> 57:35.242
An emergency, a tidal wave,
an earthquake.

57:36.119 --> 57:39.413
Hey, what is this?
Did you go to a rock concert?

57:39.581 --> 57:40.747
Yeah.

57:40.915 --> 57:42.916
Oh, yeah? Really?

57:43.084 --> 57:45.085
How'd you like it?

57:45.253 --> 57:49.298
Was it... I mean, was it heavy?
Did it achieve total heavy-ocity?

57:49.466 --> 57:51.467
It was just great.

57:51.634 --> 57:55.179
Why don't you get the guy
that took you to the rock concert...

57:55.346 --> 57:57.389
...to come over and kill the spider?

57:57.557 --> 58:00.184
I called you. You wanna
help me or not, huh?

58:00.351 --> 58:02.936
Since when do you read
the National Review?

58:03.104 --> 58:07.107
- What are you turning into?
- I like to try to get all points of view.

58:07.275 --> 58:10.027
Then get William F Buckley
to kill the spider.

58:10.195 --> 58:13.071
Alvy, you're a little hostile.
You know that?

58:13.239 --> 58:15.657
Not only that. You look thin and tired.

58:15.825 --> 58:19.161
It's three o'clock in the morning!
You got me out of bed.

58:19.329 --> 58:23.540
I ran over here. I couldn't get a taxi cab.
You said it was an emergency.

58:23.708 --> 58:27.920
I ran up the stairs. I was a lot more
attractive when the evening began.

58:28.087 --> 58:31.131
Are you going with a right-wing
rock-and-roll star?

58:31.299 --> 58:33.842
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

58:34.010 --> 58:36.720
Hey, what am I? Your son?
I came over for...

58:36.888 --> 58:38.931
I got the good chocolate.

58:39.098 --> 58:41.808
- Where's the spider?
- It's in the bathroom.

58:41.976 --> 58:46.897
Don't squish it. And after it's dead,
flush it down the toilet a couple of times.

58:47.065 --> 58:50.567
Darling, I've been killing spiders
since I was 30, OK?

58:54.072 --> 58:57.783
It's a very big spider.
Lotta trouble. There's two of them.

58:57.951 --> 59:01.954
I didn't think it was that big,
but it's a major spider. You got a broom?

59:02.121 --> 59:06.291
It's at your house. I think I left it there.
I'm sorry. What are you doing?

59:06.459 --> 59:09.920
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom
the size of a Buick.

59:10.088 --> 59:12.172
OK.

59:15.802 --> 59:17.302
Hey...

59:17.470 --> 59:21.265
- What is this? You got black soap?
- It's for my complexion.

59:21.808 --> 59:24.309
What, are you joining a minstrel show?

59:32.735 --> 59:34.820
Don't worry!

59:43.538 --> 59:46.665
I did it. I killed them both.
What are you sad about?

59:46.833 --> 59:50.586
What did you want me to do?
Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?

59:50.753 --> 59:53.880
- Oh, don't go. Please.
- What do you mean, don't...

59:54.048 --> 59:57.092
What's the matter?
Are you expecting termites?

59:57.260 --> 59:59.428
What's the matter?

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.680
I don't know. I miss you.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.433
- Oh, Jesus. Really?
- Oh, yeah.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.685
Oh...

01:00:12.066 --> 01:00:14.151
- Alvy?
- What?

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:19.197
Was there somebody in your room
when I called you?

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:23.785
- What do you mean?
- Was there... I thought I heard a voice.

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:27.748
I had the radio on. I'm sorry -
it was the television set.

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:30.000
I was watching...

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:36.173
Alvy, let's never break up again.

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:38.550
I don't wanna be apart.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:42.512
I think we're both much too mature
for something like that.

01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:46.099
Living together
hasn't been so bad, has it?

01:00:46.267 --> 01:00:48.977
No. For me, it's been terrific. You know?

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:51.605
Better than either one of my marriages.

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:57.152
There's just something different about
you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:02.074
You know, I think that if you let me,
maybe I could help you have more fun.

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:04.326
I mean, I know it's hard. It's...

01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:08.664
Alvy, what about...
what if we go away this weekend?

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:12.876
Why don't we get Rob, and the three of us
would drive into Brooklyn?

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:16.880
We could show you the old
neighbourhood. That'd be fun for you.

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:18.924
Yeah, it would.

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:21.009
Oh, my God! It's a great day!

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:24.012
Watch the road!
You're gonna total the car!

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.515
I've never even been to Brooklyn.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:30.727
Got to see the old neighbourhood.
We can show her the schoolyard.

01:01:30.895 --> 01:01:35.273
I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max.
The best. I was all-schoolyard.

01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:38.694
They threw him a football once
and he tried to dribble it.

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.862
I used to lose my glasses a lot.

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:44.700
Oh, look! That's my old house.
That's where I used to live.

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:45.909
Holy cow!

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:50.038
You're lucky. Where I lived
is now a pornographic equipment store.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:52.749
I have some
very good memories there.

01:01:52.917 --> 01:01:55.460
Your mother and father
fighting all the time?

01:01:55.628 --> 01:01:58.547
Yeah, and always over
the most ridiculous things.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.841
- You fired the cleaner?
- She stole!

01:02:01.008 --> 01:02:03.260
She's coloured!
They have enough trouble!

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:06.763
- She went through my pocketbook!
- They're persecuted enough!

01:02:06.931 --> 01:02:09.975
- Who's persecuting? She stole!
- So? We can afford it!

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:13.353
How can we afford it? On your pay?
What if she steals more?

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:16.523
She's a coloured woman from Harlem!
She has no money!

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:20.652
She's got a right to steal from us!
Who is she gonna steal from if not us?

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.405
- You're both crazy!
- They can't hear you, Max.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:26.533
Leo, I married a fool!

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:28.410
Hey, Max. What's that?

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:33.081
That's the welcome-home party,
1945, for my cousin Herbie.

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:40.046
Look. There. That's Joey Nichols.
He was my father's friend.

01:02:40.214 --> 01:02:42.841
He was always bothering me
when I was a kid.

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:45.260
Joey Nichols. See? Nickels.

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:47.429
See? Nickels.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:51.099
You see? Nickels.
You can always remember my name.

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:53.810
Just think of Joey Five Cents. Ha-ha!

01:02:53.978 --> 01:02:57.856
That's me! Joey Five Cents!

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:00.025
What an asshole.

01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:03.361
The one who killed me the most
was my mother's sister Tessie.

01:03:03.529 --> 01:03:05.989
I was always the sister
with good common sense.

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.575
Tessie was always
the one with personality.

01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:11.703
When she was younger,
they all wanted to marry Tessie.

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:16.249
Tessie Moskowitz had the personality.
She's the life of the ghetto, no doubt.

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:18.418
She was once a great beauty.

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:21.755
Tessie, they say you were
the sister with personality.

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:23.924
I was a great beauty.

01:03:24.091 --> 01:03:27.886
- How did this personality come about?
- I was very charming.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.806
There were many men interested in you?

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:33.600
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.

01:03:34.685 --> 01:03:36.686
That's very hard to believe.

01:03:36.854 --> 01:03:41.525
Well, I had a really good day. It was just
a real fine way to spend my birthday.

01:03:41.692 --> 01:03:45.278
- Your birthday's not till tomorrow.
- But it's real close.

01:03:45.446 --> 01:03:47.739
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:50.242
I wonder what this is.

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:53.578
- Happy birthday.
- What is this?

01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:55.997
Is this a present? Are you kidding?

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:59.209
- Yeah. Why don't you try it on?
- Yeah? I don't...

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:03.964
- This is more like a present for you.
- It'll add ten years to our sex life.

01:04:04.131 --> 01:04:06.925
- Yeah. Forget it.
- Here's a real present.

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.094
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:11.346
- Check it out.
- Let me see.

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:13.431
OK. Let's see.

01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:15.225
Oh, God!

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:19.104
You knew I wanted this.
God! It's terrific. God!

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:23.233
Just put on the watch and the...
and that thing and everything.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:25.235
Oh, God. Oh.

01:04:33.619 --> 01:04:37.622

01:06:56.053 --> 01:06:58.138
Thank you.

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:04.060
You were sensational. I told you
if you stuck to it you would be great.

01:07:04.228 --> 01:07:07.522
And... and you know...
you were sensational.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.734
Well, Alvy, they were
just a terrific audience.

01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:13.945
It makes it really easy for me
because I can be...

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:15.488
Excuse me.

01:07:15.656 --> 01:07:17.032
Hi, I'm Tony Lacey.

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:21.244
We just wanted to stop by and say
that we really enjoyed your set.

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.413
Oh, yeah, really?

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:26.416
I thought it was very musical
and I liked it a lot.

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:28.585
That's really nice. Thanks a lot.

01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:32.088
Are you recording? Do you...
Are you with any label now?

01:07:32.256 --> 01:07:33.757
Me? No.

01:07:33.924 --> 01:07:35.383
No. Not at all.

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:39.846
Well, I'd like to talk to you about that
sometime if you get a chance.

01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:43.475
- Possibly working together.
- Well, that's nice.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:47.937
Oh, listen. This is Alvy Singer.
Do you know Alvy?

01:07:48.105 --> 01:07:50.982
No, but I know your work.
I'm a big fan of yours.

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:53.151
Thank you very much.

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:56.196
This is Shaun and Bob and...
Bob and Petronia.

01:07:56.363 --> 01:07:58.364
Hi.

01:07:58.532 --> 01:08:01.868
We're going back to the Pierre.
We're staying at the Pierre.

01:08:02.036 --> 01:08:05.288
We're gonna meet Jack
and Anjelica and have a drink.

01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:08.166
If you'd like to come,
we'd love to have you.

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:10.585
We can just sit and talk. Nothing...

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:14.798
Not a big deal. It's just relaxed.
It would just be very mellow.

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:17.509
Remember we have that thing.

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:19.260
What thing?

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:24.765
Don't you remember we discussed
that thing that we were... We had a...

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.935
Oh, the thing!

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:29.104
Oh, the thing. Yeah.

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:30.229
Yeah...

01:08:30.397 --> 01:08:34.901
Oh, well, if it's inconvenient,
that's fine too. We'll do it another time.

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:38.904
Maybe if you're on the coast,
we'll get together and meet there.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.573
It was a wonderful set. I really enjoyed it.

01:08:41.742 --> 01:08:43.743
Nice to have met you. Good night.

01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:45.995
Bye.

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:53.502
What's the matter?
You wanted to go to that party?

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:56.131
I don't know.
I thought it might be kinda fun.

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:58.591
It would be nice
to meet some new people.

01:08:59.718 --> 01:09:04.389
I don't think I could take a mellow
evening. I don't respond well to mellow.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:08.518
I have a tendency to...
If I get too mellow, I ripen and then rot.

01:09:08.685 --> 01:09:10.687
It's not good for my...

01:09:10.854 --> 01:09:14.566
So you don't wanna go to the party.
So what do you wanna do?

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:25.618
That was the last day
I remember really having a good time.

01:09:25.786 --> 01:09:29.747
- We never have any laughs any more.
- I've been moody and dissatisfied.

01:09:29.915 --> 01:09:33.042
- How often do you sleep together?
- Do you have sex often?

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:37.796
- Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
- Constantly. I'd say three times a week.

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:41.843
- The other night Alvy wanted to have sex.
- She would not sleep with me.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:46.598
Then... I don't know... Six months ago
I would have done it just to please him.

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:51.102
I tried everything, you know.
I put on soft music and my red light bulb.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:54.272
But the thing is,
since our discussions here...

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.900
...I feel I have a right to my own feelings.

01:09:57.067 --> 01:10:00.695
I think you would have been happy
because I asserted myself.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:05.700
I'm paying for her analysis. And she's
making progress and I'm getting screwed.

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:08.745
I feel so guilty because
Alvy is paying for it.

01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:11.789
So I do feel guilty
if I don't go to bed with him.

01:10:11.957 --> 01:10:15.752
If I do go to bed with him, it's like
I'm going against my own feelings.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.881
She's making progress and I'm not.
Her progress is killing my progress.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:23.218
Sometimes I think
I should just live with a woman.

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:27.430
I don't believe it! You mean to tell me
you guys have never snorted coke?

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:31.100
Well, I always wanted to try.
But Alvy, he's very down on it.

01:10:31.268 --> 01:10:35.104
Don't put it on me. I don't wanna put
a wad of white powder in my nose.

01:10:35.272 --> 01:10:37.273
There's the nasal membrane.

01:10:37.441 --> 01:10:41.069
- You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
- How can you say that?

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:45.615
I said that you, I and that girl from your
acting class should have a threesome.

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:48.576
- Well, that's sick!
- I know it's sick, but it's new.

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:50.745
You didn't say it couldn't be sick.

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:51.871
Come on, Alvy.

01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:54.040
Do your body a favour. Try it.

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:57.085
I'm sure it's a lot of fun,
cos the Incas did it.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.254
And they were a million laughs.

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:02.465
Come on. For your own experience.
You wanna write.

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:06.594
It's great stuff. A friend of mine
just brought it in from California.

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:09.639
Oh, you know, we're going
to California next week.

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:12.392
It's incredible. I'm thrilled, as you know.

01:11:12.559 --> 01:11:16.396
On my agent's advice, I sold out
and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.

01:11:16.563 --> 01:11:20.275
No. That's not it at all.
Alvy's giving an award on television.

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:23.027
You act like
you're violating a moral issue.

01:11:23.195 --> 01:11:26.823
We have to leave New York
during Christmas week, which kills me.

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:32.245
Listen, while you're in California, could
you possibly score some coke for me?

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:37.333
Oh, sure. I'd be glad to. I'll just put it
in a hollow heel that I have on my boot.

01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:39.919
How much is this stuff, incidentally?

01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:42.088
It's about $2,000 an ounce.

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:45.383
Really? And what is the kick of it?
Cos I never...

01:11:51.056 --> 01:11:54.726
<i>~ We wish you a merry Christmas,</i>
<i>we wish you a merry Christmas... ~</i>

01:11:54.893 --> 01:11:58.730
I've never been so relaxed
as I have been since I moved here, Max.

01:11:58.897 --> 01:12:03.151
I want you to see my house. I live next to
Hugh Hefner. He lets me use the Jacuzzi.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:06.279
And the women are like
the women in Playboy magazine...

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:08.573
...only they can move their arms and legs.

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:11.743
I can't get over it -
this is really Beverly Hills.

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:14.203
The architecture's so consistent.

01:12:14.371 --> 01:12:17.540
French next to Spanish
next to Tudor next to Japanese.

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:19.709
God! It's so clean out here.

01:12:19.877 --> 01:12:23.504
They don't throw their garbage out.
They make it into TV shows.

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:25.965
Give us a break, Max.
It's Christmas.

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:28.134
Can you believe this is Christmas?

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:31.888
It was snowing and
really grey in New York, naturally.

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:34.265
Santa Claus'll have sunstroke.

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:37.143
Max, there's no crime.
There's no mugging.

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:39.312
There's no economic crime.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:44.692
But there's ritual religious-cult murders.
There's wheat-germ killers out here.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:48.154
While you're out here,
I want you to see some of my TV show.

01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:50.865
And we're invited
to a big Christmas party.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:55.912
<i>~ Remember Christ our Saviour</i>
<i>was born on Christmas Day ~</i>

01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.959
<i>~ To save us all from Satan's power</i>
<i>when we were gone astray... ~</i>

01:13:02.127 --> 01:13:05.129
All right now, Charlie,
give me a good laugh here.

01:13:05.297 --> 01:13:08.257
...limousine to the track break down?

01:13:08.425 --> 01:13:10.426
A little bigger.

01:13:10.594 --> 01:13:13.137
Max, you realise how immoral this all is?

01:13:13.305 --> 01:13:17.350
- Max, I got a hit series.
- I know. But you're adding fake laughs.

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:19.102
...home so early.

01:13:19.269 --> 01:13:21.604
Give me a tremendous laugh here,
Charlie.

01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:24.232
We do this show live
in front of an audience.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.068
And nobody laughs,
cos the jokes aren't funny.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.362
That's why this machine is dynamite.

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:33.074
Honey, you'd better lie down.
You've been in the sun too long.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.785
Now give me
a medium-sized chuckle here.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:37.954
And then a big hand.

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.916
Is there booing on that?

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.876
Oh, Max.

01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:45.711
I don't feel well.

01:13:45.879 --> 01:13:49.257
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. I just got... very dizzy.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.676
- I feel dizzy, Max.
- Well, sit down.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:53.428
Oh, Jesus!

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:55.680
- Are you all right?
- I don't know.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:59.725
- You wanna lie down?
- No. My stomach felt queasy all morning.

01:13:59.893 --> 01:14:02.854
- How about a ginger ale?
- Oh... Max, no.

01:14:03.021 --> 01:14:05.022
Maybe I'd better lie down.

01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:09.610
Why don't you try to get a little
of this down? It's just plain chicken.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:11.779
Oh, no. I can't eat this.

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:13.948
I'm nauseous.

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:18.911
If you can just give me something
to get me through the next two hours.

01:14:19.079 --> 01:14:22.748
I have to go out to Burbank
and give out an award on a TV show.

01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:26.335
There's nothing wrong with you, actually,
so far as I can tell.

01:14:26.503 --> 01:14:29.297
You have no fever.
No symptoms of anything serious.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:33.301
- You haven't eaten pork or shellfish.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry, doctor.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.387
Alvy, that was the show.
They said everything is fine.

01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:39.932
They found a replacement
so they're going to tape without you.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.143
Jesus! Now I don't get to do the TV show?

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:45.938
- I know. Listen, doctor.
- I was just saying, I can't find anything.

01:14:46.106 --> 01:14:48.774
- Nothing at all?
- No. I could get a lab man up here.

01:14:48.942 --> 01:14:50.943
Can I have the salt, please?

01:14:51.111 --> 01:14:55.198
Perhaps it would be even better
if we took him to hospital for a day or two.

01:14:55.365 --> 01:14:57.366
- Hospital?
- Or there's no real way...

01:14:57.534 --> 01:15:00.411
...to tell what's going on.
- This is not bad, actually.

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:08.461
Don't tell me we have to walk
from the car to the house.

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:12.006
My feet haven't touched pavement
since I reached Los Angeles.

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:15.468
I'll take a meeting with you
if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:18.804
I took a meeting with Freddy.
Freddy took a meeting with Charlie.

01:15:18.972 --> 01:15:20.973
All the good meetings are taken.

01:15:21.141 --> 01:15:24.101
Right now it's only a notion.
But I think I can get money...

01:15:24.269 --> 01:15:27.188
...to make it into a concept,
and then turn it into an idea.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.148
- Like this house, Max?
- Mm-hm.

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:31.651
I even brought a map
to get us to the bathroom.

01:15:31.818 --> 01:15:34.362
You should have told me
it was Tony Lacey's party.

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:36.531
What difference does that make?

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:39.992
- I think he has a thing for Annie.
- No. Unfortunately, Max...

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.537
...he goes with that girl over there.
- Where?

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:44.705
The one with the VPL.

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:46.874
- VPL?
- Visible Panty Line.

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:49.585
- Max, she is gorgeous.
- Yeah, she's a ten, Max.

01:15:49.753 --> 01:15:53.172
- Great for you, cos you're used to twos.
- There are no twos, Max.

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:57.927
The kind with shopping bags in Central
Park with surgical masks on, muttering.

01:15:58.095 --> 01:16:02.056
How do you like this couple? They just
came back from Masters and Johnson.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:04.183
Yeah. Intensive care ward.

01:16:04.351 --> 01:16:06.936
My God. Hey, Max,
I think she's giving me the eye.

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:10.147
If she comes over,
my brain'll turn into guacamole.

01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:12.441
- Hi.
- Hi. You're Alvy Singer, right?

01:16:12.609 --> 01:16:15.528
- Didn't we meet at EST?
- EST? No, I was never to EST.

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:19.156
- Then how can you criticise it?
- Oh, he didn't say anything.

01:16:19.324 --> 01:16:23.160
I came out to get some shock therapy,
but there was an energy crisis.

01:16:23.328 --> 01:16:26.330
- He's my food taster. Have you two met?
- How you doing?

01:16:26.498 --> 01:16:29.709
- You taste to see if the food's poisoned?
- Yeah. He's great.

01:16:29.876 --> 01:16:33.879
You guys are wearing white. It must be
in the stars. Uri Geller must be here.

01:16:34.047 --> 01:16:36.048
We're gonna operate together.

01:16:36.216 --> 01:16:40.386
We just need about six weeks. In six
weeks we could cut the whole album.

01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:42.638
I don't know. This is strange to me.

01:16:42.806 --> 01:16:46.350
You can come and stay here.
There's a whole wing you can have.

01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:49.353
- Yeah? Stay here?
- Really. Why are you smiling?

01:16:49.521 --> 01:16:51.355
I don't know. I don't know.

01:16:51.523 --> 01:16:55.026
Not only is he a great agent,
but he really gives good meeting.

01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:59.322
This is a great house. Really.
Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.

01:16:59.489 --> 01:17:03.618
You know who the original owners were?
Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond.

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:06.329
- Then you know who lived here?
- Trigger.

01:17:06.496 --> 01:17:09.999
Charlie Chaplin.
Right before his un-American thing.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:11.834
That's great.

01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:15.713
- But you guys are still New Yorkers.
- Yeah, I love it there.

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:20.718
I used to live there. I used to live there
for years, but... It's so dirty now.

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:22.887
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:25.681
This is a really nice
screening room, Tony.

01:17:25.849 --> 01:17:28.184
There's another thing about New York.

01:17:28.352 --> 01:17:32.688
If you wanna see a movie, you have to
stand in line. It could be freezing.

01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:35.274
We saw Grand Illusion here last night.

01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:37.902
Hey, that's a great film if you're high.

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:41.238
Come and see our bedroom.
We did a fantastic thing.

01:17:41.406 --> 01:17:43.407
No, thanks, man. I'm cool.

01:17:43.575 --> 01:17:46.619
It's wonderful. They just eat
and watch movies all day.

01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:48.788
And gradually you get old and die.

01:17:48.955 --> 01:17:51.457
It's important to make an effort
once in a while.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:54.126
Do you think his girlfriend's beautiful?

01:17:54.294 --> 01:17:56.837
A tad on the androgynous side,
but dynamite.

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:59.340
Yeah. I forgot my mantra.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.985
That was fun.

01:18:20.153 --> 01:18:23.114
I don't think California's bad at all.

01:18:23.281 --> 01:18:25.491
It's a drag coming home.

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:27.660
A lot of beautiful women.

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:29.870
It was fun to flirt.

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:32.039
I have to face facts.

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:36.335
I adore Alvy, but our relationship
doesn't seem to work any more.

01:18:36.503 --> 01:18:40.339
I'll have the usual trouble
with Annie in bed tonight.

01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:42.508
Why do I need this?

01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:47.179
If only I had the nerve to break up.
But it would really hurt him.

01:18:47.347 --> 01:18:51.142
If only I didn't feel guilty
asking Annie to move out.

01:18:51.309 --> 01:18:54.520
It'd probably wreck her.
But I should be honest.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:57.857
Alvy, let's face it. You know...

01:18:58.024 --> 01:19:00.943
I don't think our relationship is working.

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:04.155
I know. A relationship,
I think, is like a shark.

01:19:04.322 --> 01:19:07.616
It has to constantly move forward,
or it dies.

01:19:07.784 --> 01:19:11.162
And I think what we got on our hands
is a dead shark.

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:14.081
Whose Catcher in the Rye is this?

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:17.042
If it has my name on it,
then I guess it's mine.

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:20.379
It sure has... You wrote
your name in all my books...

01:19:20.547 --> 01:19:22.840
...cos you knew this day was gonna come.

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:26.385
Alvy, you wanted to break up
just as much as I do.

01:19:26.553 --> 01:19:30.973
No question. I think we're doing
the mature thing, without any doubt.

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:36.270
All the books on death and dying are
yours, and all the poetry books are mine.

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:41.025
Denial of Death. This is the first book
that I got you. Remember that day?

01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:44.695
Jeez, I feel like
there's a great weight off my back. Hm.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:46.864
Oh. Thanks, Annie.

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:50.493
Oh, no, no, no. I mean,
I think it's really important for us...

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:53.621
...to explore new relationships
and stuff like that.

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:57.958
There's no question about that. Cos
we've given this a more than fair shot.

01:19:58.126 --> 01:20:00.669
My analyst thinks this move is key for me.

01:20:00.837 --> 01:20:04.632
And, you know, I trust her.
Because my analyst recommended her.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.427
Why should I put you through
all my moods and hang-ups anyway?

01:20:08.595 --> 01:20:10.721
And you know what the beauty part is?

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:14.016
- We can always get back together again.
- Exactly.

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:18.896
I don't think many couples could handle
this. Just break up and remain friends.

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:22.900
Hey, this one's mine, this button.
I guess these are all yours.

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:25.402
Impeach Eisenhower. Impeach Nixon.

01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:28.739
Impeach Lyndon Johnson.
Impeach Ronald Reagan.

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:33.953
I miss Annie. I made a terrible mistake.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.664
She's living in Los Angeles
with Tony Lacey.

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:40.918
Then the hell with her. If she likes
that lifestyle, let her live there.

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:43.963
- He's a jerk, for one thing.
- He graduated Harvard.

01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:48.843
He may have... Listen, Harvard makes
mistakes too. Kissinger taught there.

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:51.011
Don't tell me you're jealous.

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:53.722
Yeah. Jealous? A little bit. Like Medea.

01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:58.018
Can I show you something, lady?
I have here... I found this in the apartment.

01:20:58.186 --> 01:21:01.814
Black soap. She used to wash her face
800 times a day with black soap.

01:21:01.982 --> 01:21:03.983
Don't ask me why.

01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:06.485
Why don't you go out with other women?

01:21:06.653 --> 01:21:10.197
Well, I tried. But it's... you know,
it's very depressing.

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:13.325
This always happens to me.
Quick! Get a broom!

01:21:14.327 --> 01:21:18.038
What are you making such a big deal
about? They're only lobsters.

01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:21.166
You're a grown man.
You know how to pick up a lobster.

01:21:21.334 --> 01:21:24.670
- I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
- When did you quit?

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:25.921
16 years ago.

01:21:26.089 --> 01:21:27.506
What do you mean?

01:21:27.674 --> 01:21:28.966
Mean?

01:21:29.759 --> 01:21:33.345
You stopped smoking 16 years ago.
Is that what you said?

01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:36.932
I don't understand.

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.184
Are you joking or what?

01:21:51.031 --> 01:21:53.032
Central Park's turning green.

01:21:53.199 --> 01:21:56.076
Yeah. I saw that lunatic
that we used to see...

01:21:56.244 --> 01:22:00.414
...with the pinwheel hat,
you know, and the roller skates.

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:03.208
Listen, I... I want you to come back here.

01:22:04.127 --> 01:22:07.880
Well... Then I'm gonna
come out there and get you.

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:14.553
What do you mean, where am I?
Where do you think I am?

01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:17.473
I'm at the Los Angeles airport. I flew in.

01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:20.059
I... Well, I flew in to see you.

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:24.396
Hey, listen. Can we not
debate this on the telephone?

01:22:24.564 --> 01:22:27.024
Because I feel that I got a temperature.

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:32.029
And I'm getting my chronic Los Angeles
nausea already. I don't feel so good.

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:36.742
Wherever you wanna meet. I don't care.
I'll drive in. I rented a car.

01:22:37.410 --> 01:22:39.578
I'm driving. What do you...

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:42.831
What, is that such a miracle?
I'm driving myself.

01:22:58.890 --> 01:23:02.810
I'm gonna have the alfalfa sprouts and...

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:05.062
...a plate of mashed yeast.

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:17.491
Hi.

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.834
You look very pretty.

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:30.671
Oh, no. I just lost
a little weight, that's all.

01:23:34.759 --> 01:23:37.845
Well... you look nice.

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:41.724
I've been thinking about it,
and I think that we should get married.

01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:43.350
Oh, Alvy. Come on.

01:23:44.936 --> 01:23:47.271
Why? You wanna live out here?

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:49.690
It's like living in Munchkin Land.

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:53.152
What do you mean?
It's perfectly fine out here.

01:23:53.319 --> 01:23:55.320
I mean, Tony's very nice.

01:23:55.488 --> 01:23:59.700
And... well, I meet people
and I go to parties and we play tennis.

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:02.953
I mean, that's a very big step for me,
you know.

01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:05.539
I mean, I'm able to enjoy people more.

01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:09.251
So... you're not gonna
come back to New York?

01:24:09.419 --> 01:24:13.255
What's so great about New York? It's
a dying city. You read Death in Venice.

01:24:13.423 --> 01:24:16.300
You didn't read Death in Venice
till I bought it for you.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:20.095
That's right. You only gave me books
with the word "death" in the title.

01:24:20.263 --> 01:24:22.514
Cos it's an important issue.

01:24:22.682 --> 01:24:25.017
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life.

01:24:25.185 --> 01:24:28.103
You're like New York City.
You're just this person.

01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:30.773
You're like this island unto yourself.

01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:33.692
I can't enjoy anything
unless everybody is.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:38.489
If one guy is starving someplace,
that's... it puts a crimp in my evening.

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:42.785
So you wanna get married or what?

01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:47.081
No. We're friends.

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:49.333
I wanna remain friends.

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:52.461
OK.

01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:54.296
Check, please!

01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:56.632
You're mad, aren't you?

01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:00.302
Yes, of course I'm mad.
Because you love me. I know that.

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:05.140
Alvy, I can't say that that's true
at this point in my life. I really can't.

01:25:05.308 --> 01:25:07.309
You know how wonderful you are.

01:25:07.477 --> 01:25:12.022
You know you're the reason that I got out
of my room and that I was able to sing...

01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:15.442
...and get more in touch
with my feelings and all that crap.

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:19.655
Anyway, look, I don't wanna...
Listen, listen, listen, um...

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:22.616
So what are you up to anyway, huh?

01:25:24.744 --> 01:25:28.789
The usual, you know. I'm trying to write.
I'm working on a play.

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:33.377
So what are you saying? You're
not coming back to New York with me?

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:36.380
No. Look...

01:25:37.924 --> 01:25:39.341
I gotta go.

01:25:39.509 --> 01:25:42.052
- I flew 3,000 miles to see you.
- I'm late.

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:45.180
Air miles. You know what
that does to my stomach?

01:25:45.348 --> 01:25:48.433
It's a hectic time for Tony.
The Grammies are tonight.

01:25:48.601 --> 01:25:51.478
- The what?
- He's got a lot of records up for awards.

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:54.731
They give awards for that music?
I thought just earplugs.

01:25:54.899 --> 01:25:57.734
Just forget it!
Let's just forget the conversation.

01:25:57.902 --> 01:26:01.363
Awards! They do nothing
but give out awards! I can't believe it.

01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:04.324
Greatest fascist dictator - Adolf Hitler.

01:26:33.938 --> 01:26:39.067
I know what you're gonna say. I'm not a
great driver. I have some problems with...

01:26:39.235 --> 01:26:41.236
Can I see your licence, please?

01:26:41.404 --> 01:26:44.031
Just don't get angry or anything, cos I...

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:46.200
I have my licence here.

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.368
It's a rented car and I... I...

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:49.494
Here.

01:26:49.662 --> 01:26:51.580
Don't give me your life...

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:52.706
...story.

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:54.875
Just pick up the licence.

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:59.421
You have to ask nicely cos I've had
an extremely rough day. My girlfriend...

01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:01.757
Just give me the licence, please.

01:27:03.092 --> 01:27:06.345
Since you put it that way,
it's hard for me to refuse.

01:27:06.512 --> 01:27:09.139
I have a terrific problem with authority.

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:12.184
It's not your fault. Don't take it personal.

01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:22.194
So long, fellas. Keep in touch.

01:27:31.871 --> 01:27:35.791
Imagine my surprise
when I got your call, Max.

01:27:35.959 --> 01:27:39.211
Yeah. I had the feeling
that I got you at a bad moment.

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:41.588
I heard high-pitched squealing.

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:43.757
Twins, Max.

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:46.176
16-year-olds.

01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:50.973
Can you imagine
the mathematical possibilities of that?

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:55.143
You're an actor, Max. You should be
doing Shakespeare in the Park.

01:27:55.311 --> 01:27:58.188
I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max.
I got mugged.

01:27:58.356 --> 01:28:03.068
I was playing Richard II, and two guys
with leatherjackets stole my leotard.

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:10.075
Max, are we driving through plutonium?

01:28:10.868 --> 01:28:12.869
It keeps out the alpha rays, Max.

01:28:13.037 --> 01:28:15.122
You don't get old.

01:28:16.916 --> 01:28:20.127
You're a thinking person.
How can you choose this lifestyle?

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:23.005
What is so incredibly great
about New York?

01:28:23.172 --> 01:28:26.133
It's a dying city.
You read Death in Venice.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:28.593
You didn't read it till I gave it to you.

01:28:28.761 --> 01:28:31.013
You only give me books
with "death" in the title.

01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:34.975
- It's an important issue.
- You are totally incapable of enjoying life.

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.602
You're like New York. You're an island.

01:28:37.770 --> 01:28:41.481
OK. If that's all that we've been
through together means to you...

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:45.152
...I guess it's better if we just
say goodbye, once and for all.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:49.656
You know, it's funny, after all the serious
talks and passionate moments...

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:53.744
...that it ends here, in a health-food
restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.

01:28:53.911 --> 01:28:56.079
Goodbye, Sunny.

01:28:56.247 --> 01:28:57.748
Wait.

01:28:57.915 --> 01:29:00.000
I'm gonna go with you.

01:29:01.085 --> 01:29:03.086
I love you.

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:08.508
What do you want? It was my first play.

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:12.929
You know how you're always trying to
get things to come out perfect in art...

01:29:13.097 --> 01:29:15.432
...because it's real difficult in life.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.686
Interestingly, however,
I did run into Annie again.

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:22.481
It was on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan.

01:29:22.648 --> 01:29:26.026
She had moved back to New York.
She was living in SoHo with some guy.

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:30.030
And when I met her, she was dragging
him in to see The Sorrow and the Pity...

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:33.116
...which I counted as a personal triumph.

01:29:33.284 --> 01:29:36.286
Annie and I had lunch
sometime after that and...

01:29:36.454 --> 01:29:38.872
...just kicked around old times.

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:45.837
<i>~ Just to have my arms ~</i>

01:29:46.172 --> 01:29:50.967
<i>~ Around you ~</i>

01:29:52.136 --> 01:29:57.349
<i>~ Still the thrill that it was ~</i>

01:29:57.517 --> 01:30:01.812
<i>~ The day I found you ~</i>

01:30:01.979 --> 01:30:07.150
<i>~ Seems like ~</i>

01:30:08.444 --> 01:30:14.491
<i>~ Old times ~</i>

01:30:15.701 --> 01:30:22.791
<i>~ Dinner dates and flowers ~</i>

01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:26.962
<i>~ Old times ~</i>

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:30.382
After that,
it got pretty late and we both had to go.

01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:35.011
But it was great seeing Annie again.
I realised what a terrific person she was...

01:30:35.179 --> 01:30:37.806
...and how much fun it was
just knowing her.

01:30:37.974 --> 01:30:40.684
And I thought of that old joke, you know.

01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:43.979
This guy goes to a psychiatrist
and says...

01:30:44.147 --> 01:30:47.941
..."Doc, my brother's crazy.
He thinks he's a chicken."

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:51.528
And the doctor says,
"Well, why don't you turn him in?"

01:30:51.696 --> 01:30:54.739
And the guy says,
"I would, but I need the eggs."

01:30:54.907 --> 01:30:59.327
Well, I guess that's pretty much now
how I feel about relationships.

01:30:59.495 --> 01:31:04.458
You know, they're totally irrational
and crazy and absurd and...

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:11.006
But I guess we keep going through it
because most of us need the eggs.

01:31:11.841 --> 01:31:19.848
<i>~ You ~</i>
