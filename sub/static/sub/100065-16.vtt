WEBVTT

00:04.873 --> 00:07.140
I mean, seriously,

00:07.209 --> 00:09.609
have you ever seen so many,
uh, whatchamacallits?

00:09.678 --> 00:11.244
Precious Moments.

00:11.313 --> 00:12.824
Those little statues
all over the place.

00:12.848 --> 00:15.248
That's what they're called.
Precious Moments?

00:15.317 --> 00:17.250
They're, like, a
really big thing...

00:17.319 --> 00:20.053
with cat ladies and my mother.

00:22.057 --> 00:23.390
Hey.

00:24.793 --> 00:27.460
Hey, there, pretty girl. Hi.
Boy.

00:27.529 --> 00:28.795
You sure?

00:28.864 --> 00:30.797
Uh, positive.

00:33.001 --> 00:35.468
Think he wants us to follow him.

00:35.537 --> 00:37.604
Okay, Lassie. Hey.

00:39.641 --> 00:42.242
Oh, I seriously cannot believe
that we are doing this.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.470
Ten to one we're being
punk'd by Sector Charlie.

00:44.494 --> 00:45.012
Yeah.

00:45.013 --> 00:47.347
Just let me go!

00:47.416 --> 00:49.015
You're not going anywhere!

00:49.084 --> 00:50.328
Let me go!
How many times I got to tell you?

00:50.352 --> 00:51.718
Yo! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:51.787 --> 00:53.164
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Break it off.

00:53.188 --> 00:54.666
Break it-- Step away.
Yo, yo. All good. All good.

00:54.690 --> 00:56.189
Hey, what-what's going on?

00:56.258 --> 00:57.535
- Back away.
- We're just having a discussion, man.

00:57.559 --> 00:58.903
Discussion?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:58.927 --> 01:00.412
You ever had a discussion before? Yo.
He hit me.

01:00.413 --> 01:01.829
Get this dog away from me. Get
this dog away from me right now.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.853
Hey.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.399
Cuff him.

01:09.371 --> 01:11.137
Unbelievable.

01:11.206 --> 01:13.406
This is all we got?
Sorry.

01:13.475 --> 01:15.875
We're standing in front
of a police precinct,

01:15.944 --> 01:16.712
and this is all we got?

01:16.736 --> 01:18.646
Yeah, I'm telling you,
that's all we got.

01:18.647 --> 01:20.880
Well... Well,
it's unacceptable.

01:20.949 --> 01:22.482
Why are you getting so hot?

01:22.551 --> 01:23.795
What do you mean?
The guy spray-painted

01:23.819 --> 01:26.119
my car!
<i>Our</i> car.

01:26.188 --> 01:28.299
You're gonna split hairs with me now.
I'm just saying.

01:28.323 --> 01:30.256
Well, I'm just saying
we look like idiots.

01:30.325 --> 01:31.891
I mean, we look
like the dopey cops

01:31.960 --> 01:33.526
in the <i>Smokey and</i>
<i>the Bandit</i> movies.

01:33.595 --> 01:36.529
Relax. It's probably just
some kid vandalizing.

01:36.598 --> 01:38.732
I'm sure no one
will even notice.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.100
Love the new
paint job, Reagan.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.669
Looking good, Danny Boy.

01:42.738 --> 01:45.105
You see that? We're
laughingstocks.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.740
Not we. You.

01:46.808 --> 01:48.508
Your car, remember?

01:48.577 --> 01:52.412
Way to look after
your partner, partner.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.417
Don't even say it.

01:59.755 --> 02:01.588
It was Kennedy.

02:01.656 --> 02:03.089
Pretty sure it was Roosevelt.

02:03.158 --> 02:04.190
Which one?

02:04.259 --> 02:05.325
Franklin D.

02:05.393 --> 02:07.761
No. JFK. 100%.

02:07.829 --> 02:09.429
- Google it. Morning, sir.
- Morning.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.164
Maybe you can help settle this.

02:11.233 --> 02:13.733
Which president coined the term
"first hundred days"?

02:13.802 --> 02:16.336
FDR.
I say JFK.

02:16.404 --> 02:20.006
FDR gave an address
in July of 1933.

02:20.075 --> 02:22.075
Since then it's
been the benchmark.

02:23.078 --> 02:24.177
Thank you.

02:24.246 --> 02:26.112
This about the <i>Times?</i>

02:26.181 --> 02:27.258
We've held them off
for about as long

02:27.282 --> 02:28.392
as we're gonna get away with.

02:28.416 --> 02:31.184
The mayor's office
has been hounding me 24-7.

02:31.253 --> 02:33.820
This hounding in
reference to anything

02:33.889 --> 02:36.322
about my wanting more cops?

02:36.391 --> 02:38.792
No, it's about you
talking to the <i>Times</i>

02:38.860 --> 02:41.828
about his first 100 days,
in a positive way.

02:41.897 --> 02:47.934
Then let them howl.

02:48.003 --> 02:51.805
I prefer "mutually
beneficial exchange."

02:51.873 --> 02:55.275
Seriously?
It's the only language he knows.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.310
I'm not quite sure
how to communicate that.

02:57.379 --> 03:00.079
Well, then, I will. Tomorrow.

03:00.148 --> 03:01.526
Okay, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

03:01.550 --> 03:03.983
This <i>Times</i> hundred-day thing,
when's it run?

03:04.052 --> 03:06.586
Next weekend.
The cover of the magazine.

03:06.655 --> 03:09.923
Then get it done today
or step off it.

03:16.298 --> 03:19.499
Well, what do you know?

03:19.568 --> 03:20.978
I used to have a daughter
named Nicky

03:21.002 --> 03:22.168
who looked just like you.

03:22.237 --> 03:24.604
Hi, Mom. I know it's been
a while since I called.

03:24.673 --> 03:26.239
Almost a week.

03:26.308 --> 03:28.341
You know, in the real world,

03:28.410 --> 03:30.176
that's not actually
a very long time.

03:30.245 --> 03:33.146
Oh, really? Well, when you carry
another living being

03:33.215 --> 03:35.515
inside of you for nine months,

03:35.584 --> 03:36.883
then you can tell me that.

03:36.952 --> 03:38.451
Actually, wait, don't.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.787
Wait, that's not why
you're calling.

03:40.856 --> 03:42.133
Tell me that's not
why you're calling.

03:42.157 --> 03:43.456
Relax, Mom.

03:43.525 --> 03:45.925
I'm not pregnant.
I just called to say hi.

03:45.994 --> 03:48.661
Well, you just made my day.

03:48.730 --> 03:50.296
You look tired.
Long day?

03:50.365 --> 03:52.098
Thank you. Yes.

03:52.167 --> 03:53.444
You should come out here
and visit.

03:53.468 --> 03:55.501
Do some California dreaming
with me.

03:55.570 --> 03:57.170
I should.

03:57.239 --> 03:58.738
But you won't.

03:58.807 --> 04:00.673
Well, you should see my desk.

04:00.742 --> 04:02.787
Ugh, I'm so sorry,
that's my boss on the other line.

04:02.811 --> 04:05.311
I'll call you right back, okay?
Wait. Wait, Nick. Nick...

04:05.380 --> 04:06.446
Bye.
Nick.

04:14.356 --> 04:18.356

Uh-huh.

04:47.999 --> 04:51.967
Feeling lightheaded,
woozy?

04:52.036 --> 04:54.136
No. I told you I'm fine.

04:54.205 --> 04:55.638
I'm just gonna
check your pupils.

04:55.707 --> 04:57.707
Can you look at
my face for me?

05:03.448 --> 05:06.716
Would you look at
this pretty girl!

05:06.784 --> 05:08.651
Handsome man.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.320
I mean, does nobody here
understand basic biology?

05:11.389 --> 05:14.023
He's a boy.
A very good boy.

05:14.092 --> 05:16.292
He really did all that?
Led you right to the bad guy?

05:16.360 --> 05:18.027
I gotta admit,
it was pretty cool.

05:18.096 --> 05:19.462
But no tags on him?
No.

05:19.530 --> 05:21.442
No one in the neighborhood seems
to have ever seen him before.

05:21.466 --> 05:23.966
He's got to belong
to somebody.

05:24.035 --> 05:25.468
Who's got to belong
to somebody?

05:25.536 --> 05:27.136
Jamie.

05:27.205 --> 05:28.816
Whoa, is this the hero
everybody's talking about?

05:28.840 --> 05:30.506
Easiest collar we ever made.

05:30.575 --> 05:31.674
It was amazing.

05:31.743 --> 05:34.777
That's great.
Any luck finding his owner?

05:34.846 --> 05:36.278
Um, we-we looked
in our sector,

05:36.347 --> 05:37.947
and we checked
the adjoining sectors,

05:38.015 --> 05:39.381
and-and nothing.

05:39.450 --> 05:40.861
Well, if he's as impressive
as you say he is,

05:40.885 --> 05:42.251
then he's probably not a stray.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.352
That's what I say.

05:43.421 --> 05:45.588
He's got to belong
to somebody.

05:45.656 --> 05:48.157
All right, well, I'll check
with Animal Control,

05:48.226 --> 05:50.559
our K-9 unit, any other
law enforcement agencies

05:50.628 --> 05:52.161
that I can think of.

05:52.230 --> 05:55.898
Oh, um... but, well, what if he
doesn't belong to any of them?

05:55.967 --> 05:57.466
Oh, whoa.

05:57.535 --> 05:59.379
Don't worry, we'll find
his owner. Come on, bud.

06:10.581 --> 06:13.415
Aw, TARU got nothing.

06:13.484 --> 06:16.185
Yeah? You were gone a long time
to come back with nothing.

06:16.254 --> 06:18.532
That's 'cause I was riding them.
You know, I was trying to

06:18.556 --> 06:20.089
get them to, like, zoom in,

06:20.158 --> 06:22.224
telescope, get a close-up.

06:22.293 --> 06:24.193
Any useable frame
of the perp's face.

06:24.262 --> 06:26.262
Okay.
Okay what?

06:26.330 --> 06:27.396
What are you thinking?

06:27.465 --> 06:29.376
I'm thinking you were flirting
with the TARU girl

06:29.400 --> 06:30.599
you think is so cute.

06:30.668 --> 06:31.801
Somebody's jealous.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.869
Someone's wishful thinking.

06:33.938 --> 06:35.604
Maybe.
Here.

06:35.673 --> 06:37.540
Take a look at this.

06:37.608 --> 06:39.441
Earlier today,
a hooded tagger

06:39.510 --> 06:43.012
defaced a slew of NYPD cop cars
in Lower Manhattan.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.214
This is the second instance
in two days

06:45.283 --> 06:47.082
where NYPD vehicles
have been tagged.

06:47.151 --> 06:49.552
Both times a hooded graffiti
artist got away

06:49.620 --> 06:51.887
without being caught.

06:51.956 --> 06:53.322
O-Okay...

06:53.391 --> 06:56.192
Well, maybe now you can
get over yourself.

06:56.260 --> 06:58.160
What are you talking about?
Well, it's obvious

06:58.229 --> 06:59.895
it was nothing personal.

06:59.964 --> 07:03.766
Whoever did this has a beef
with NYPD in general.

07:03.835 --> 07:05.501
Maybe now we can move on.

07:05.570 --> 07:06.836
No, maybe we can't move on.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.003
Okay? Let's go.

07:08.072 --> 07:09.271
Are you serious?

07:09.340 --> 07:11.173
He graffitied our car!

07:11.242 --> 07:13.342
Your car.

07:17.548 --> 07:20.282
Power.

07:20.351 --> 07:23.118
Your last name is
actually "Power"?

07:25.656 --> 07:29.191
Kind of on the nose, no?

07:34.465 --> 07:37.199
Never mind. Shall we?

07:37.268 --> 07:38.968
Let's.

07:40.905 --> 07:43.539
3,000 new cops.
That's what he wants.

07:43.608 --> 07:46.542
That's the price?

07:46.611 --> 07:49.345
Uh, prices you pay, we earn.

07:49.413 --> 07:51.080
This is more like
everybody's better off.

07:51.148 --> 07:55.017
And if he says no,
then everybody's worse off?

07:55.086 --> 07:56.619
I wouldn't put it that way.

07:56.687 --> 07:58.454
That's exactly how
you'll put it.

07:58.522 --> 08:00.456
He wants this.

08:00.524 --> 08:02.358
Your guy needs his support.

08:02.426 --> 08:04.426
Or the <i>Times</i> just
runs the profile

08:04.495 --> 08:05.728
without your guy's two cents.

08:05.796 --> 08:09.531
His opinion is worth a whole
lot more than two cents.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.133
He works for the mayor.

08:11.202 --> 08:12.635
He polls higher in every metric.

08:12.703 --> 08:14.470
We're not giving you
3,000 new cops.

08:14.538 --> 08:16.005
Sure you are.
We're not.

08:16.073 --> 08:18.340
Then thank you for stopping by.

08:21.579 --> 08:24.046
You've been in that chair
too long.

08:24.115 --> 08:27.016
So has your boss.

08:27.084 --> 08:30.019
Says so himself once a week.

08:30.087 --> 08:34.722
Final answer, no.

08:34.792 --> 08:37.159
You don't have that power,
Power.

08:37.227 --> 08:41.496
We do have the power to ensure
our guy saves face.

08:41.565 --> 08:43.565
Maybe you do.
My guy kind of likes

08:43.634 --> 08:46.535
bloody noses and busted lips.

08:58.749 --> 09:02.051
I'm thinking of giving
this one to Jessica.

09:02.119 --> 09:03.886
What do you think?

09:03.955 --> 09:04.987
Think she's ready?

09:05.056 --> 09:06.755
I do, yeah.

09:06.824 --> 09:09.625
She's gonna need some help on
the investigative side, but...

09:09.694 --> 09:11.060
I'll lend a hand.

09:11.128 --> 09:12.828
Thank you.

09:15.166 --> 09:16.332
How about you?

09:16.400 --> 09:18.100
How about me what?

09:18.169 --> 09:19.435
Are you gonna answer me?

09:19.503 --> 09:21.437
Huh?
I've asked you twice

09:21.505 --> 09:23.906
why you seem out of it.

09:23.975 --> 09:26.608
Both times you act like
you got cotton in your ears.

09:26.677 --> 09:28.043
Nothing, it's just--

09:28.112 --> 09:32.414
It's just not my
best morning, that's all.

09:34.218 --> 09:36.518
Mm. Gotcha.

09:36.587 --> 09:38.454
You got what?
You know, one time

09:38.522 --> 09:41.557
I got my load on, I peed in the
hamper instead of the toilet.

09:41.625 --> 09:45.260
Thank you for that completely
unnecessary and incredibly

09:45.329 --> 09:48.130
vivid mental imagery.
I'm just saying,

09:48.199 --> 09:51.433
uh, we've all done stupid
and embarrassing stuff

09:51.502 --> 09:52.634
after having a few.

09:52.703 --> 09:55.471
I'm not hung over, Anthony.
Then what?

09:57.174 --> 10:01.310
Nothing.
Really, it's nothing.

10:03.848 --> 10:08.017
Okay, so you will take care
of this with Jessica, right?

10:08.085 --> 10:11.086
Consider it done.

10:15.826 --> 10:17.893
Got to be kidding me.
I'm afraid not, Detective.

10:17.962 --> 10:19.161
Well, look around.

10:19.230 --> 10:21.163
There's half dozen
surveillance cameras out here.

10:21.232 --> 10:22.898
Danny.
No, I want to know

10:22.967 --> 10:25.567
how this guy slips in here,
despite all these cameras

10:25.636 --> 10:27.870
and throws up all
over our RMPs,

10:27.938 --> 10:29.171
and nobody sees
a single thing.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.080
He already said.
All the cameras picked him up.

10:31.142 --> 10:32.586
Yeah, but they didn't
pick up his face!

10:32.610 --> 10:34.243
I mean, how is
that even possible?

10:34.311 --> 10:35.644
Guy's smart.

10:35.713 --> 10:36.945
No, he's not smart.

10:37.014 --> 10:38.881
He's lucky, but he's not smart.

10:38.949 --> 10:40.794
Danny, obviously, he clocked
all these cameras here,

10:40.818 --> 10:43.352
just like you did. He just
remembered not to say "cheese."

10:43.421 --> 10:44.598
You know what
he's doing, right?

10:44.622 --> 10:46.622
He's giving us the finger
in broad daylight

10:46.690 --> 10:48.690
for the entire city to see,
that's what he's doing.

10:48.759 --> 10:50.959
Maybe it's just a prank.
Prank?

10:51.028 --> 10:54.797
He bombed all of our cars
in our own yard!

10:54.865 --> 10:57.466
Is there any of the footage
of him getting dropped off

10:57.535 --> 10:59.701
from a car,
an Uber, a taxi?

10:59.770 --> 11:01.270
Nothing. He appears on foot.

11:01.338 --> 11:03.972
On foot? How does
someone get here on foot?

11:04.041 --> 11:05.274
Subway.
Yes.

11:05.342 --> 11:07.142
There's an "A" and a "C"
and an "E"

11:07.211 --> 11:08.343
that way about six blocks.

11:08.412 --> 11:09.845
That's how he got here.
Let's go.

11:15.519 --> 11:17.219
But all in all, you like him.

11:17.288 --> 11:19.221
I like him for a boss.

11:19.290 --> 11:20.556
So far.

11:20.624 --> 11:24.460
Then my advice is, let's keep
the good times rolling.

11:24.528 --> 11:27.663
Do the interview,
give him your positive review.

11:30.835 --> 11:33.202
We'll fight for cops
on other fronts.

11:33.270 --> 11:34.636
Such as?

11:34.705 --> 11:36.505
Police unions,
the City Council.

11:36.574 --> 11:38.841
The elected officials
in underserved districts.

11:38.909 --> 11:40.476
We'll pin him in from all sides.

11:40.544 --> 11:41.977
So hide behind blowhards?

11:42.046 --> 11:43.579
Not at all.

11:43.647 --> 11:46.682
And after these other fronts
carve out their share?

11:46.750 --> 11:48.684
You'll still have more cops.

11:48.752 --> 11:50.652
Hopefully, at or near
the numbers you wanted.

11:50.721 --> 11:53.455
But realistically,
a half dozen crossing guards

11:53.524 --> 11:56.291
and some hug-a-cop-today PSAs.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.827
Oh, you got to think positively.

11:59.864 --> 12:02.664
What are you afraid of?

12:02.733 --> 12:06.034
That maybe our mayor
doesn't have the Achilles heel

12:06.103 --> 12:07.436
I thought he did.

12:07.505 --> 12:10.973
So? What's his weak spot?

12:11.041 --> 12:13.041
Come on. Everybody has one.

12:13.110 --> 12:14.543
What's yours?

12:15.579 --> 12:17.546
Okay, hold on.

12:17.615 --> 12:19.848
No, no.
You're just improvising one.

12:22.753 --> 12:27.356
So, the advice you are giving me
is to just back off?

12:27.424 --> 12:31.627
No, my advice to you
is, wait a bit,

12:31.695 --> 12:33.028
maybe the <i>next</i> hundred days.

12:33.097 --> 12:34.329
See what we see.

12:37.501 --> 12:40.302
I need more cops
a hundred days ago.

12:40.371 --> 12:42.538
<i>Just like</i>

12:42.606 --> 12:45.240
I told you, he took the subway.

12:45.309 --> 12:47.476
Now who's the genius?

12:47.545 --> 12:49.344
I never said
he was a genius.

12:49.413 --> 12:52.714
I'm not talking about him.
I'm saying I'm the genius.

12:52.783 --> 12:54.917
Well, before you accept
your Mensa certificate,

12:54.985 --> 12:57.819
let me remind you
that while we do have his face,

12:57.888 --> 12:59.733
it ain't popping in
our facial recognition software.

12:59.757 --> 13:02.090
Yes, that was a setback.

13:02.159 --> 13:04.393
Is.
Was.

13:04.461 --> 13:06.261
What is this?
His MetroCard

13:06.330 --> 13:07.563
swipe was at 12:30.

13:07.631 --> 13:09.932
The MetroCard was purchased
with a credit card

13:10.000 --> 13:12.267
belonging to one Charles Morrow.

13:12.336 --> 13:14.670
Wow. I'm actually impressed.

13:14.738 --> 13:16.772
Mensa, Mensa, Mensa.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.208
So, what's his story?
He in our system?

13:19.276 --> 13:21.210
No, and I don't know.

13:21.278 --> 13:23.045
Ah, I'm a little less impressed.

13:23.113 --> 13:24.780
Yeah, but it's our guy.

13:24.848 --> 13:28.050
Uh-- Not a single prior?
How is that even possible?

13:28.118 --> 13:29.563
No, and it gets
a little more confusing,

13:29.587 --> 13:33.088
because he's an honor student
at NYU with a GPA of 5.0.

13:33.157 --> 13:34.590
But he is our guy.

13:34.658 --> 13:37.759
So this honor student
is our cop-hating vandal?

13:37.828 --> 13:39.228
How do you explain that?

13:39.296 --> 13:42.297
That, uh, I can't explain.

13:42.366 --> 13:44.600
Mensa, Mensa, Mensa.

13:44.668 --> 13:46.668
Indeed.

13:52.986 --> 13:56.387
Do you remember when I said this
smelled like a revenge thing?

13:56.456 --> 13:58.289
No, I remember
that's what I said.

13:58.358 --> 13:59.623
And I said I agree.

13:59.692 --> 14:01.258
No, your exact words were,

14:01.327 --> 14:03.361
"Don't get carried
away, Reagan."

14:03.429 --> 14:04.462
He said, she said.
Mm-hmm.

14:04.530 --> 14:06.097
Can I get to the point, please?

14:06.165 --> 14:07.264
Please.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.433
So, this kid's name,
Charles Morrow,

14:09.502 --> 14:10.646
it sounded familiar.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

14:10.670 --> 14:13.270
So I thought, well,
maybe we collared him before,

14:13.339 --> 14:15.573
but he doesn't have any priors.

14:15.641 --> 14:16.641
Right.

14:16.676 --> 14:19.143
Do you remember
this case from last year?

14:19.212 --> 14:20.644
Yeah, 58 shots.

14:20.713 --> 14:23.147
"Brandon...

14:23.216 --> 14:25.182
Morrow."
Morrow.

14:26.619 --> 14:29.820
So that guy back then
is our guy's brother?

14:29.889 --> 14:32.323
With a rap sheet
six blocks long.

14:32.392 --> 14:34.759
So it is a revenge case.
Like I said from the beginning.

14:34.827 --> 14:36.594
No, like <i>I</i> said
from the beginning.

14:36.662 --> 14:38.696
Mensa, Mensa, Mensa.

14:47.407 --> 14:49.840
May I help you?

14:49.909 --> 14:52.710
Ma'am, I'm-I'm sorry,
may I help you?

14:54.881 --> 14:55.980
Oh, sorry.

14:56.049 --> 14:58.849
Um, I'm here to see Jack.

14:58.918 --> 15:01.085
Do you have an appointment?

15:01.154 --> 15:04.021
I'm his wife-- uh, ex-wife.

15:04.090 --> 15:06.123
Oh.

15:06.192 --> 15:08.993
Do you want to go see
if he has a minute?

15:09.062 --> 15:11.796
Right. Yes. Of course.

15:33.086 --> 15:35.352
Erin, hi.

15:35.421 --> 15:36.754
Come on in.

15:41.861 --> 15:43.794
Nice to see you.

15:46.566 --> 15:49.266
You look great.

15:49.335 --> 15:50.668
Have a seat.

15:58.144 --> 15:59.577
Something wrong?

15:59.645 --> 16:01.812
You've got
that "something

16:01.881 --> 16:04.849
weighing heavily on my mind but
I don't want to say it" look.

16:07.854 --> 16:09.854
You hurt me.

16:10.890 --> 16:12.490
What?

16:14.393 --> 16:16.894
You hurt me.

16:16.963 --> 16:20.064
Erin, I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:20.133 --> 16:21.499
What-- Y-You know.

16:21.567 --> 16:24.435
I honestly don't.

16:24.504 --> 16:28.105
I've been denying it
for so long and...

16:28.174 --> 16:32.409
keeping it from you
since day one, but more so,

16:32.478 --> 16:35.913
just denying it from myself.

16:36.949 --> 16:38.649
Are you having some kind of

16:38.718 --> 16:41.085
out-of-body experience
or something?

16:41.154 --> 16:44.121
It's the truth.

16:46.592 --> 16:49.593
H-How, how am I supposed
to respond to this?

16:52.265 --> 16:54.265
You're not.

17:09.315 --> 17:11.915
I need 3,000 more cops.

17:11.983 --> 17:14.251
Yeah, you said that.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.554
And then I said,
"I can't afford it."

17:16.622 --> 17:18.255
You can't <i>not</i> afford it.

17:18.324 --> 17:20.169
Tell that to the teacher's
union, the Housing Authority,

17:20.193 --> 17:22.171
all the other agencies
coming with their hands out.

17:22.194 --> 17:25.128
Yeah, you call 911,
you're not looking for a teacher

17:25.198 --> 17:26.664
or affordable housing.

17:26.732 --> 17:29.567
Answer's still no.

17:29.635 --> 17:35.172
You realize I could just try
to pin you in from other fronts.

17:35.241 --> 17:39.310
City council, elected officials
from underserved districts...

17:39.378 --> 17:42.346
You could, but you won't.

17:42.415 --> 17:44.348
They'd all want their taste.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.016
By the time you got your share,

17:46.085 --> 17:48.018
you could maybe
afford a ham sandwich.

17:50.389 --> 17:53.224
That's exactly
what I told Garrett.

17:54.427 --> 17:56.594
Let's kick it down the road.

17:56.662 --> 17:58.829
Take another look
in the next fiscal year.

18:00.866 --> 18:06.770
Or I could just trash-talk you
to the <i>Times.</i>

18:06.839 --> 18:10.140
Sticks and stones.

18:11.544 --> 18:15.512
To the extent you would have
no choice but to fire me.

18:17.516 --> 18:19.617
So that's on the table?

18:19.685 --> 18:24.388
Mr. Mayor,
everything's on the table.

18:24.457 --> 18:26.223
Resignation?

18:26.292 --> 18:28.292
That, too.

18:31.764 --> 18:35.633
As they say,
change is the only constant.

18:35.701 --> 18:38.669
But not all change
has equal weight.

18:42.308 --> 18:44.575
Let's take a moment.

18:44.644 --> 18:48.912
I have overseen a record drop
in crime, decade to decade.

18:48.981 --> 18:53.017
My polling favorables beat the
hell out of yours all day long.

18:53.085 --> 18:54.151
You running for something?

18:54.220 --> 18:57.154
Just for my job.

18:57.223 --> 19:02.593
And change may be a constant,
but its effect runs the gamut.

19:02.662 --> 19:04.795
That's some pedestal
you've built up for yourself.

19:05.831 --> 19:08.766
Nah.

19:08.834 --> 19:11.268
You know,
a lot of my old friends

19:11.337 --> 19:15.205
are selling their homes
and moving to Florida.

19:15.274 --> 19:16.707
Old houses,

19:16.776 --> 19:19.943
ranches, split ranches,
California ranches.

19:20.012 --> 19:24.715
And what's surprising
is a lot of them,

19:24.784 --> 19:27.051
they're not just
ugly old houses anymore.

19:27.119 --> 19:31.288
T-They're called
"mid-century modern" now.

19:31.357 --> 19:34.958
And all of a sudden,
they're irreplaceable.

19:35.995 --> 19:39.430
And that's you? Irreplaceable?

19:39.498 --> 19:42.366
No.

19:42.435 --> 19:44.034
But you might want
to think twice

19:44.103 --> 19:47.104
before you just go
and tear me down.

19:50.109 --> 19:52.409
Everything I said is true.

20:00.853 --> 20:03.187
I just got here
and the front desk

20:03.255 --> 20:06.390
said that you needed
to see me right away.

20:09.528 --> 20:11.695
Oh, he did not do this.

20:13.366 --> 20:15.366
Oh, he did.

20:17.970 --> 20:20.437
Why are you such a bad boy?

20:20.506 --> 20:22.673
Needless to say, he's not
a law enforcement animal.

20:22.742 --> 20:24.007
Well, maybe, he...

20:24.076 --> 20:26.977
Guy came through here, said
he recognized your furry friend,

20:27.046 --> 20:30.080
that he used to belong
to a gangbanger named Duquann.

20:30.149 --> 20:31.281
Why used to?

20:31.350 --> 20:34.184
Apparently, Mutt--
that is his given name--

20:34.253 --> 20:35.686
was too much
of a goody-goody.

20:35.755 --> 20:37.321
He was always giving up

20:37.390 --> 20:39.957
the gang's positions
instead of playing watchdog.

20:40.025 --> 20:43.160
See? Oh, I knew you were
a good boy.

20:43.229 --> 20:44.294
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.

20:44.363 --> 20:45.529
I knew you
were a good boy.

20:45.598 --> 20:47.431
That's my good boy.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.932
You're a good dog.

20:49.001 --> 20:51.502
Jamie. Let's take him home
with us.

20:51.570 --> 20:52.570
Are you kidding me?

20:52.605 --> 20:53.537
Why not?

20:53.606 --> 20:55.305
Seriously?

20:55.374 --> 20:57.574
This is just a little mess.

21:00.613 --> 21:04.281
Good boy, didn't I?
I knew you were a good boy.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.883
Good boy.

21:06.919 --> 21:09.286
This is the police,
open up now!

21:11.590 --> 21:12.623
This is the police,

21:12.691 --> 21:14.725
open up now!

21:14.794 --> 21:15.859
Everything's okay.

21:15.928 --> 21:17.728
Listen to me, Charles.

21:17.797 --> 21:18.862
I spoke to the landlord,

21:18.931 --> 21:20.664
he told me he hasn't
seen anyone leave,

21:20.733 --> 21:21.832
so I know you're in there!

21:21.901 --> 21:23.600
Now open the door
before I knock it down!

21:24.703 --> 21:25.836
Open the damn door!

21:25.905 --> 21:27.337
I don't believe
he's home.

21:28.407 --> 21:30.340
Where is he?

21:30.409 --> 21:32.476
Oh, I-I do not
very much know.

21:32.545 --> 21:33.811
Did you see him leave?

21:35.281 --> 21:36.391
Well, how could you know that

21:36.415 --> 21:37.692
he's not home
if you didn't see him leave?

21:37.716 --> 21:38.982
Danny.

21:39.051 --> 21:41.218
You little son of a bitch,
I know you're in there,

21:41.287 --> 21:42.407
and I'm gonna...

21:43.556 --> 21:46.190
Sorry for
the inconvenience, folks.

21:48.627 --> 21:51.195
Sorry for the trouble, folks.
Sorry.

21:53.257 --> 21:55.323
Little piece of crap's
in there, I'm telling you.

21:55.810 --> 21:57.076
I know it.

21:57.145 --> 22:00.580
Uh, I'm not so
sure about that.

22:07.188 --> 22:09.155
I'm gonna kill him.

22:10.592 --> 22:12.525
I'm gonna kill him.

22:17.799 --> 22:21.401
Not now, Anthony.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.870
Anthony, not...

22:23.939 --> 22:25.200
Hi, Mom.

22:25.201 --> 22:27.771
What are you doing here?

22:27.871 --> 22:30.464
Are you kidding me?

22:30.465 --> 22:32.198
Ooh...

22:32.267 --> 22:35.101
God, you smell good. Did
you always smell this good?

22:35.170 --> 22:36.369
I just got
off a red eye.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.072
I'm all sweaty and
gross. I stink.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.740
Stink of heaven.

22:40.809 --> 22:42.675
You're only slightly biased.

22:42.744 --> 22:46.779
Look at you.
What are you doing here?

22:46.848 --> 22:48.426
Well, I knew you'd be
too busy to visit <i>me,</i>

22:48.450 --> 22:49.883
so I decided to
come see <i>you.</i>

22:51.953 --> 22:54.554
He called you.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.788
Who?

22:55.857 --> 22:57.423
Your father.

22:57.492 --> 22:59.192
He did not.

22:59.261 --> 23:00.693
Of course he did.

23:00.762 --> 23:04.297
He really didn't,
but... why would he...

23:06.334 --> 23:09.269
I got in a car accident
the other day.

23:09.337 --> 23:10.337
What?

23:10.372 --> 23:11.671
It was a little fender bender.

23:11.740 --> 23:14.340
I was treated and released
by medical professionals.

23:14.409 --> 23:15.409
I am fine.

23:15.443 --> 23:17.443
It's no big deal.
Okay?

23:17.512 --> 23:21.581
So let's just not even
mention it again.

23:24.185 --> 23:27.720
Do you have time
for something to eat?

23:27.789 --> 23:30.023
Yeah. Sure.

23:34.829 --> 23:36.007
Listen to me,
you son of a bitch,

23:36.031 --> 23:37.463
I spoke to the landlord,

23:37.532 --> 23:38.976
he told me
he hasn't seen anyone leave,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.801
so I know you're in there!

23:41.870 --> 23:43.447
Now open the door
before I knock it down!

23:43.471 --> 23:44.482
You know, they're right.

23:44.506 --> 23:45.438
The camera does
add five pounds.

23:45.507 --> 23:48.508
More like ten.

23:50.478 --> 23:51.844
Hey, what's so funny?

23:51.913 --> 23:54.514
No, Danny, you don't want
any part of this.

23:54.582 --> 23:58.151
- Want any part of what?
- It's the police, open up now!

23:58.219 --> 23:59.919
I'm gonna find you,
you son of a bitch!

24:07.195 --> 24:09.595
...door before I knock it...

24:09.664 --> 24:10.763
knock it down!

24:15.103 --> 24:17.303
Trust me,
this is a good thing, okay?

24:17.372 --> 24:19.138
Then why is my
tummy turning?

24:19.207 --> 24:21.507
I told you, I got a buddy
in the K-9 unit.

24:21.576 --> 24:22.508
Maybe they could use him.

24:22.577 --> 24:24.877
Oh, his ears are back.
So?

24:24.946 --> 24:27.380
That's bad. That
means he's worried.

24:27.449 --> 24:28.926
Well, maybe it's 'cause
you're putting off

24:28.950 --> 24:30.516
really bad vibes.

24:30.585 --> 24:33.853
I'm getting
really bad vibes.

24:33.922 --> 24:35.488
Well,
we're not even there yet.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.523
Jamie, look at him.

24:37.592 --> 24:40.693
He knows. He wants
to be with us.

24:40.762 --> 24:42.795
Honey, please, come on,
don't do this.

24:42.864 --> 24:44.130
Right back atcha.

24:44.199 --> 24:46.799
Look, I think he's great too,
but we cannot keep this dog.

24:46.868 --> 24:48.534
Why not?
Because.

24:51.406 --> 24:52.806
This dog is nuts!

24:52.874 --> 24:54.240
He's just eccentric!

24:55.276 --> 24:57.744
He's fast as hell
is what he is.

25:11.993 --> 25:13.037
Police, don't move!
Hands where we can see 'em!

25:13.061 --> 25:14.427
Police! Police!

25:14.496 --> 25:15.428
Hands where I can see them!

25:15.497 --> 25:16.562
Don't move!

25:16.631 --> 25:18.331
Well, I don't suppose
this is yours.

25:19.901 --> 25:21.501
Turn around. Hands
behind your back.

25:21.569 --> 25:23.736
I told you he
was a good boy.

25:23.805 --> 25:25.138
This dog's not going anywhere.

25:27.175 --> 25:29.709
Good boy.

25:32.947 --> 25:35.581
We really need to know
where your friend is.

25:35.650 --> 25:36.883
He's not friend to me.

25:36.951 --> 25:38.618
He's just man on other side
of wall.

25:38.686 --> 25:39.797
Well, you were
very protective

25:39.821 --> 25:41.381
of the man on the
other side of the wall

25:41.423 --> 25:42.633
when we were here
the other day.

25:42.657 --> 25:44.524
Because you bang on doors
like pots and pans.

25:44.592 --> 25:46.626
You also knew
that he wasn't home.

25:46.694 --> 25:48.561
What does this mean
you are saying?

25:48.630 --> 25:50.396
- My partner means...
- What I mean

25:50.465 --> 25:52.498
is, what exactly
is your relationship

25:52.567 --> 25:54.167
with your neighbor?
Relationship?

25:54.235 --> 25:57.403
What relationship?
I am married woman.

25:57.472 --> 26:00.973
- You do not put disrespect on me.
- No, he doesn't mean

26:01.042 --> 26:02.909
anything by it.
No disrespect.

26:02.977 --> 26:04.110
I promise,
Mrs. Sayeed.

26:04.179 --> 26:05.645
He is wild boar, this man.

26:05.713 --> 26:08.781
Yes, he is just under
a lot of pressure right now.

26:08.850 --> 26:11.384
Unfortunately, your neighbor

26:11.453 --> 26:13.152
has really been
pushing his buttons.

26:13.221 --> 26:15.388
Charles is a good person.

26:15.457 --> 26:16.589
So you do know him?

26:16.658 --> 26:20.827
Know him? Yes.
Relationship, no.

26:20.895 --> 26:22.261
Oh.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.974
I should not be talking
about man on other side of wall.

26:23.998 --> 26:24.998
You speak to husband.

26:25.033 --> 26:27.533
You just said
he was a good person.

26:27.602 --> 26:28.634
What makes you so sure?

26:28.703 --> 26:31.971
I have three children.

26:32.040 --> 26:35.108
Sometimes I'm very tired.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.909
He does babysitting.

26:36.978 --> 26:39.579
Well, does husband know man on
the other side of the wall

26:39.647 --> 26:40.647
is babysitting for you?

26:40.682 --> 26:42.181
You are out of the bounds.

26:42.250 --> 26:43.783
Danny?

26:45.320 --> 26:46.686
We know about
what happened

26:46.754 --> 26:48.321
to Charles' brother.

26:48.389 --> 26:51.023
Did he ever say anything
to you about that?

26:53.061 --> 26:54.627
Very upset.

26:54.696 --> 26:55.795
How upset?

26:57.132 --> 26:59.932
Hate police.
Want revenge.

27:01.503 --> 27:05.004
You have any reason to believe
that Charles is dangerous?

27:05.073 --> 27:08.040
I pray each night he is not.

27:19.387 --> 27:20.686
You think that's bad?

27:20.755 --> 27:23.033
I was the first on a crime scene
where the power had gone out

27:23.057 --> 27:24.290
in the building.

27:24.359 --> 27:25.836
I was scoping around
with my flashlight,

27:25.860 --> 27:29.028
and...

27:29.097 --> 27:32.398
I felt a very weird squish
under my foot.

27:32.467 --> 27:34.133
What kind of squish?

27:34.202 --> 27:36.736
The kind that your foot makes
when it steps on an eyeball.

27:36.804 --> 27:38.137
Oh, my God!

27:38.206 --> 27:40.039
Gnarly!

27:40.108 --> 27:41.507
Ugh! Wait,

27:41.576 --> 27:42.786
did you actually
step on an eyeball?

27:42.810 --> 27:44.076
Yeah.

27:44.145 --> 27:45.878
Ugh!
Welcome back, kiddo.

27:45.947 --> 27:47.246
Hey...

27:47.315 --> 27:49.081
Did you miss us?

27:49.150 --> 27:50.917
Can we stop?

27:50.985 --> 27:52.285
Stop what?

27:53.788 --> 27:57.423
This.
This endless accounting

27:57.492 --> 28:00.092
of all the horrible,
awful things

28:00.161 --> 28:01.360
that go on in the world.

28:01.429 --> 28:02.895
Endless?

28:02.964 --> 28:04.330
Come on.

28:04.399 --> 28:06.032
It just seems like

28:06.100 --> 28:07.667
this is all we do
at family dinners.

28:07.735 --> 28:10.036
Pass the potatoes
and bad karma.

28:10.104 --> 28:13.739
And how exactly is it
that we're passing bad karma?

28:13.808 --> 28:16.209
I don't know, Danny. I guess
I'm just not in the mood

28:16.277 --> 28:18.077
to hear about
your double homicide in Harlem,

28:18.146 --> 28:20.746
or the 11-year-old
that Jamie collared,

28:20.815 --> 28:22.715
or the eyeball
that Eddie stepped on...

28:25.353 --> 28:27.353
...the latest credible threat
from ISIS

28:27.422 --> 28:28.465
that you received
from Washington,

28:28.489 --> 28:29.833
and I'm sure
you don't want to hear

28:29.857 --> 28:32.925
about the four-year-old
with cigarette burns

28:32.994 --> 28:34.594
up and down her back
like tic-tac-toe,

28:34.662 --> 28:36.762
and her mother,
who swears she just doesn't know

28:36.831 --> 28:38.664
how they got there.

28:54.716 --> 28:56.782
I just...

28:56.851 --> 28:57.917
Hey.

28:57.986 --> 29:02.121
Everyone here's
been in your shoes.

29:02.190 --> 29:05.992
You wearing my heels again?

29:08.029 --> 29:08.961
Sorry,

29:09.030 --> 29:12.598
it's just a long week.
I'm fine.

29:14.802 --> 29:17.737
Or you will be.
It's okay.

29:17.805 --> 29:19.883
Most days I come home from work
a blubbering mess.

29:19.907 --> 29:22.275
I don't even bother
to wear mascara anymore.

29:22.343 --> 29:23.909
I don't either.

29:25.580 --> 29:28.648
Sorry, I got to go.

29:28.716 --> 29:29.949
My armed robbery Vic.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.451
With no arms,

29:32.520 --> 29:33.919
one eyeball and, uh, measles.

29:44.732 --> 29:46.299
Reagan.

29:46.367 --> 29:48.934
Is policeman who bangs on doors
like pots and pans, no?

29:49.003 --> 29:50.770
Oh, it's you.

29:50.838 --> 29:53.205
I have very big problem.

29:53.274 --> 29:54.840
I need very much help.

29:54.909 --> 29:56.409
Oh, now you need my help.

29:56.477 --> 29:57.877
Okay, what's the problem?

29:57.945 --> 30:01.380
I just get very bad text
from man on other side of wall.

30:01.449 --> 30:02.715
Charles Morrow?

30:02.784 --> 30:05.117
He tell me the policemen
come into the building.

30:05.186 --> 30:06.752
He too scared
to go into his apartment,

30:06.821 --> 30:07.987
so he go into mine.

30:08.056 --> 30:08.988
He what?

30:09.057 --> 30:10.623
It is bad.

30:10.692 --> 30:12.925
I am at my sister's house
with my husband and family.

30:12.994 --> 30:15.561
Husband found out,
this is very not good.

30:15.630 --> 30:16.862
Okay, but if you're not home,

30:16.931 --> 30:18.397
how did he get into
your apartment?

30:18.466 --> 30:20.700
I told you.
He babysits.

30:20.768 --> 30:22.568
He knows where spare key.

30:22.637 --> 30:24.970
Okay.
Here's what you're gonna do.

30:25.039 --> 30:26.250
You're gonna stay
right where you are,

30:26.274 --> 30:28.174
and whatever you do,
do not go home.

30:28.242 --> 30:29.386
Okay? I'm gonna head over there

30:29.410 --> 30:30.690
and see
what the hell's going on.

30:35.561 --> 30:37.494
Come on, Charles, open the door!

30:37.563 --> 30:39.396
This is your last warning!

30:39.465 --> 30:42.499
You don't open it
now, we're coming in!

30:42.568 --> 30:45.335
Hit it.

30:45.404 --> 30:47.537
Let's go!
Go, go, go!

30:47.606 --> 30:49.840
Take left!
Move it! Let's go!

30:49.908 --> 30:52.209
Move! Move! Move!
Bedroom clear!

30:54.980 --> 30:57.214
Kitchen clear!

30:58.450 --> 30:59.783
Clear!

30:59.852 --> 31:01.885
What do you mean, "clear"?
Where the hell is he?

31:01.954 --> 31:03.453
here's nobody here, Detective.

31:03.522 --> 31:05.555
Son of a bitch.
He must be on the move.

31:05.624 --> 31:07.391
He must have run out the window.
Come on!

31:07.459 --> 31:10.060
Let's go! He's on the run!

31:11.263 --> 31:12.295
Go!

31:30.949 --> 31:32.983
Surprise. Come on.

31:33.052 --> 31:35.686
On your feet.

31:35.754 --> 31:37.487
Too bad you didn't have
a peephole camera

31:37.556 --> 31:38.655
to record that, huh?

31:38.724 --> 31:40.157
What the hell is wrong with you?

31:40.225 --> 31:42.259
Sometimes I'm out of the bounds.

31:42.327 --> 31:43.493
Let's go.

31:46.365 --> 31:47.964
You're really gonna keep him?

31:48.033 --> 31:50.467
After we collared
the purse snatcher,

31:50.536 --> 31:51.802
Jamie looked at me and he said,

31:51.870 --> 31:53.214
"We are not getting rid
of this dog."

31:53.238 --> 31:55.639
Yeah, I didn't say
we were keeping him, either.

31:55.708 --> 31:57.007
He means at our apartment.

31:57.076 --> 31:58.341
We are keeping him, but not...

31:58.410 --> 32:00.243
But he's gonna live
here at the precinct.

32:00.312 --> 32:02.245
Exactly.
Which means

32:02.314 --> 32:03.947
he's really all of our dog.

32:04.016 --> 32:05.215
One hundred percent.

32:05.284 --> 32:07.017
Yeah, and that means
everyone here

32:07.086 --> 32:08.685
is gonna be
cleaning up after him.

32:08.754 --> 32:10.420
Which means we should
all get a vote

32:10.489 --> 32:11.922
on what his name is gonna be.

32:11.990 --> 32:14.157
Oh, I hadn't even given thought

32:14.226 --> 32:16.026
about what his name
was gonna be.

32:16.095 --> 32:17.961
We did.

32:21.734 --> 32:23.133
Jamko.

32:23.202 --> 32:24.634
You got to be kidding me.

32:30.542 --> 32:33.877
I love it.
Oh, it's perfect.

32:34.913 --> 32:37.514
Hey. Hey, yeah.

32:37.583 --> 32:38.982
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:50.295 --> 32:53.230
My brother was a good person.

32:53.298 --> 32:54.631
I believe that.

32:54.700 --> 32:55.966
You do?

32:56.034 --> 32:57.801
Well, I didn't know him.

32:57.870 --> 33:00.470
I believe you believe that.

33:00.539 --> 33:03.273
He didn't deserve to die.

33:06.478 --> 33:08.178
Let me tell you something
I've learned

33:08.247 --> 33:10.680
in the couple of decades
on the job-- and you're young,

33:10.749 --> 33:14.217
but you're starting
to see for yourself already.

33:14.286 --> 33:15.886
Life is hard.

33:15.954 --> 33:21.391
And it gets harder every
time you make a bad choice.

33:21.460 --> 33:23.727
More bad choices you make,
the more they stack up.

33:23.796 --> 33:25.061
And let me tell you something,

33:25.130 --> 33:27.230
your brother's stack
was really high.

33:27.299 --> 33:30.500
And you might think it
didn't have to end this way,

33:30.569 --> 33:32.869
but it was never gonna be
a happy ending.

33:32.938 --> 33:35.872
He came out of the box that way.

33:35.941 --> 33:38.275
Always in trouble.

33:39.311 --> 33:42.212
And you came out different.

33:44.116 --> 33:48.652
But yet here you are,
collared for vandalism,

33:48.720 --> 33:51.054
graffiti, trespassing.

33:52.090 --> 33:54.624
Am I in a lot of trouble?

33:54.693 --> 33:57.260
Well, that depends.

33:57.329 --> 34:01.464
Depends which stack you're
gonna keep piling up.

34:01.533 --> 34:04.134
You have a new stack,
which, I got to tell you,

34:04.203 --> 34:05.635
is piling up pretty quick.

34:05.704 --> 34:07.671
Or you can go back
to your old pile,

34:07.739 --> 34:10.106
which is stacked
really high.

34:10.175 --> 34:13.976
Good grades and great
accomplishments.

34:17.449 --> 34:19.616
I'm sorry.

34:21.453 --> 34:24.888
I actually believe that you are.

34:24.956 --> 34:26.723
So, what happens next?

34:26.792 --> 34:29.391
You go in the system.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.428
As a first-time offender
with a good track record,

34:31.496 --> 34:34.797
you'll probably get off easy.

34:34.867 --> 34:37.367
After that, it's up to you.

34:39.036 --> 34:41.705
Thank you.

34:43.876 --> 34:47.310
You really want to thank me,
you'll lose the word "pig"

34:47.379 --> 34:49.880
from your vocabulary.

35:09.835 --> 35:11.601
Sorry to keep you waiting.

35:11.670 --> 35:13.103
Everybody have what they need?

35:13.171 --> 35:14.671
If you mean liquids, yes.

35:14.740 --> 35:16.306
You are quick.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.540
He's quick.

35:20.646 --> 35:22.612
The other day,
when you said that everything

35:22.681 --> 35:26.216
you said was true,
that was a lie.

35:26.285 --> 35:30.854
Hey, any lies he tells come from
me, and I didn't give him any.

35:30.923 --> 35:33.990
Mr. Mayor, to my knowledge,
everything I said is true.

35:34.059 --> 35:37.327
Less than 20% of housing
inventory in the suburbs

35:37.396 --> 35:40.797
where your cop pals live is
considered mid-century modern.

35:40.866 --> 35:43.099
You took it literally
and looked it up?

35:43.168 --> 35:45.669
I looked it up.

35:47.239 --> 35:48.338
Yeah,

35:48.407 --> 35:49.906
at his request.

35:52.477 --> 35:55.946
Look, I, uh, am very sorry
you felt misled.

35:56.014 --> 35:58.815
I was only trying to make
a point. Anything else?

35:58.884 --> 36:00.517
Anything else what?

36:00.585 --> 36:05.522
Anything else you want
to label me with lying about?

36:06.558 --> 36:08.258
No.

36:09.294 --> 36:11.227
Okay.

36:14.666 --> 36:17.867
I can find money
for a thousand cops.

36:19.604 --> 36:22.706
Even that's gonna cost me with
a dozen other city agencies,

36:22.774 --> 36:25.809
especially the FDNY.

36:25.877 --> 36:28.878
It's the best I can do.

36:30.148 --> 36:32.148
Okay.

36:33.185 --> 36:34.384
Okay?

36:35.988 --> 36:38.588
Thank you.

36:38.657 --> 36:40.590
You heard right, right?

36:40.659 --> 36:42.859
A third of what you requested.

36:42.928 --> 36:45.562
Any help will do.
I appreciate it.

36:46.832 --> 36:48.098
That's it?

36:48.166 --> 36:50.433
Uh, no threats to resign,

36:50.502 --> 36:52.068
or to trash me in the <i>Times?</i>

36:53.105 --> 36:54.704
No.

36:54.773 --> 36:57.140
So if I had said
a thousand cops from the top,

36:57.209 --> 36:58.353
you would have been agreeable?

36:58.377 --> 37:00.143
I might have been,
but you didn't offer

37:00.212 --> 37:03.213
one single cop from the top.

37:03.281 --> 37:06.216
Holy hell.
Are you really this good?

37:06.284 --> 37:08.084
Is he?

37:12.124 --> 37:15.291
So, the <i>Times?</i>

37:16.328 --> 37:19.295
I sat down with them yesterday.

37:19.364 --> 37:20.797
Before you knew what I'd do?

37:20.866 --> 37:23.066
Well, me tearing down
the new mayor

37:23.135 --> 37:25.435
wasn't gonna do
a lick of good for anybody.

37:25.504 --> 37:26.736
But you said...

37:26.805 --> 37:28.405
I said I could.

37:28.473 --> 37:32.108
Big difference
between could and would.

37:35.981 --> 37:39.682
So thank you. Shall we?

37:41.153 --> 37:43.386
I'll show you out.

37:51.129 --> 37:53.129
I'm right behind you.

37:57.803 --> 37:59.135
Mr. Mayor.

38:00.172 --> 38:02.338
One more true thing?

38:02.407 --> 38:07.177
I will only ever come to you
in need or in service.

38:07.245 --> 38:08.845
I won't exaggerate the need

38:08.914 --> 38:11.247
nor try to service
any personal agenda.

38:11.316 --> 38:12.816
You have my word.

38:14.886 --> 38:18.188
So,

38:18.256 --> 38:23.093
next hundred days, maybe
you want to keep that in mind?

38:42.080 --> 38:44.047
Hi.

38:44.116 --> 38:45.982
Jack? Uh...

38:46.051 --> 38:48.651
Don't worry, I didn't, uh,
I didn't hijack dinner.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.487
Nicky is still joining.

38:50.555 --> 38:52.689
I wasn't worried.

38:52.757 --> 38:56.259
I could see you having visions
of the two of us

38:56.328 --> 38:59.262
as pawns in a bad
<i>Parent Trap</i> plot.

38:59.331 --> 39:02.332
Okay, so maybe
slightly concerned.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.834
I asked her to run
a quick errand for me

39:04.903 --> 39:08.037
so that I could, I could just
have a second alone with you.

39:08.106 --> 39:09.939
Look, Jack, about
the other day, I...

39:10.008 --> 39:11.107
Thank you

39:11.176 --> 39:13.276
for saying all of that.

39:13.345 --> 39:15.578
Thank you?
You said

39:15.647 --> 39:18.248
what I have wanted to say.

39:18.316 --> 39:22.118
What I should have said
a long time ago.

39:24.156 --> 39:28.691
I know that I hurt you.

39:28.760 --> 39:32.829
And I could bore you
with all of the whys,

39:32.898 --> 39:34.898
but we both know
that you are

39:34.966 --> 39:36.533
a better lawyer than me,

39:36.601 --> 39:39.102
and so you would poke a thousand
holes into my argument,

39:39.171 --> 39:43.873
so let's just cut
to my summation.

39:43.942 --> 39:47.343
I am sorry.

39:48.380 --> 39:50.580
Oh, Jack.

39:50.649 --> 39:52.115
But...
I had a scare

39:52.184 --> 39:53.783
the other day,

39:53.852 --> 39:58.054
and it made me look at my life.

39:58.123 --> 40:01.891
And you were all over it.

40:01.960 --> 40:06.629
And the hurt part
was just a tiny chapter

40:06.698 --> 40:08.698
in the whole story.

40:12.537 --> 40:14.571
Okay.

40:14.639 --> 40:18.441
So, it's absolutely
pouring out there.

40:18.510 --> 40:22.779
You really needed gum
that badly, Dad?

40:24.382 --> 40:26.816
I'm s-- Uh, sorry, sweetie.

40:26.885 --> 40:28.985
It, uh, probably
could have waited.

40:29.054 --> 40:31.020
Now he tells me.

40:31.089 --> 40:33.656
So, what looks good?

40:35.527 --> 40:37.293
This.

40:37.362 --> 40:40.196
This looks good.
