00:24.500 --> 00:26.200
_

00:26.201 --> 00:29.418
He's really... it's really messed up.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.700
_

00:31.701 --> 00:34.117
Hey, hello. Habla English?

00:34.169 --> 00:37.087
Hey, are you the son? Ow!

00:37.122 --> 00:38.221
Grandson.

00:38.321 --> 00:42.821
_

00:42.878 --> 00:44.845
She hit... hit him while driving.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.980
My leg. El smack-o.

00:47.981 --> 00:51.902
Look. Look.

00:51.980 --> 00:53.946
Just a crazy old biznatch
who ran over my brother.

00:53.982 --> 00:55.365
It hurts so bad.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.316
It hurts so bad.

00:57.369 --> 00:58.651
It hurts so bad.

01:00.166 --> 01:02.218
Look at that. Yeah, it's this one.

01:02.265 --> 01:03.848
- My leg.
- She... she broke his leg.

01:03.865 --> 01:05.531
And then she stood on the gas.
It's a hit-and-run.

01:05.583 --> 01:07.784
She... she felonied me. That's a felony.

01:07.786 --> 01:09.068
Got the whole thing...
Got the whole thing right here.

01:09.085 --> 01:10.384
- Ay, dios mio.
- Okay, hold on. Hold on.

01:10.419 --> 01:11.918
- L... let me talk to her.
- So, start talking.

01:11.919 --> 01:12.818
Yeah, good.

01:13.816 --> 01:15.415
_

01:15.515 --> 01:16.482
Aah! Look.

01:16.515 --> 01:17.731
He can't... he can't put
any pressure on it.

01:17.766 --> 01:19.066
I need to lean on you, so...

01:19.101 --> 01:20.934
I think it's... it's definitely broken.

01:20.986 --> 01:22.236
Es muy mal for my leg-o.

01:22.271 --> 01:23.854
Here. Lean up... lean up on the mantel.

01:23.856 --> 01:25.155
No, man, it really hurts.

01:25.191 --> 01:26.573
Just hang in there. Hang in there.

01:26.609 --> 01:29.193
- "Muy mal"?
- Yeah, it's muy mal.

01:29.195 --> 01:32.913
Dude.

01:32.948 --> 01:35.332
- Dude.
- Yes, si, problema.

01:35.367 --> 01:36.667
Shh, shh, shh!

01:36.702 --> 01:39.419
- And now dos problemas. Aah!
- Dude!

01:39.455 --> 01:41.255
Si, d-dos big problemas.

01:42.541 --> 01:46.376
I don't know what you're saying, man.

01:46.378 --> 01:47.594
- Dude.
- Si.

01:47.630 --> 01:48.962
- Dude.
- Si.

01:49.014 --> 01:50.964
We got a real problem here... Si.

01:51.016 --> 01:52.966
Yeah, si, problema. Shh.

01:53.018 --> 01:55.602
Ay, dios mio. Ay, dios mio.

01:58.724 --> 02:00.307
Hey, amigo, what are you gonna
do about this leg situation?

02:00.359 --> 02:02.526
I really need to see a doctor.

02:02.561 --> 02:05.195
A doctor... doctors ain't cheap,
yo. It's gonna cost.

02:05.231 --> 02:07.814
Either you or her... somebody's got to pay.

02:07.867 --> 02:10.317
You want money.

02:10.369 --> 02:11.735
Yes! Yeah, damn straight.

02:11.737 --> 02:13.570
Hit-and-run? It's no joke.

02:13.572 --> 02:15.956
We're... what are the cops gonna say?

02:15.991 --> 02:18.158
Cops?

02:18.210 --> 02:19.960
They coming?

02:19.995 --> 02:22.963
- Y... yeah, yeah, maybe.
- That's up to you, man.

02:22.998 --> 02:24.414
They... the cops...

02:24.416 --> 02:25.632
They can be looking
at this tape anytime now.

02:25.668 --> 02:27.050
It's all up to you.

02:27.086 --> 02:29.753
Aah!

02:29.755 --> 02:31.305
Oh, that's really bad.

02:31.340 --> 02:35.392
You c-called her "biznatch"?

02:35.427 --> 02:37.227
- I didn't...
- Yeah, but whatever, man.

02:37.263 --> 02:38.812
Please, hurry it up. I'm hurting here.

02:38.847 --> 02:40.597
Show us the green,
or LA policia is gonna come,

02:40.599 --> 02:42.182
and they're gonna be taking granny away!

02:42.234 --> 02:43.817
She's gonna go to jail. Do you want that?

02:43.852 --> 02:45.402
Yeah, that's right... play it smart.

02:45.437 --> 02:47.821
Okay, good. So, let's talk dollar amounts.

02:47.856 --> 02:49.823
For what you did to my...

02:52.528 --> 02:55.696
No! No!

02:55.748 --> 02:57.748
Biznatch.

04:38.239 --> 04:39.107
No, abuelita.

_

04:47.081 --> 04:48.664
Ay, mijo.

04:48.700 --> 04:49.832
A-abuelita.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.700

04:54.700 --> 04:56.200
_

04:56.291 --> 04:59.225
Oh. Bueno.

04:59.290 --> 04:59.690

04:59.760 --> 05:01.594
Si. Si.

05:01.660 --> 05:03.760

05:08.360 --> 05:12.460
_

05:12.473 --> 05:14.106
Si. Si.

05:14.142 --> 05:16.809
Si.

05:33.425 --> 05:36.426
Hi. Get over here.

05:36.428 --> 05:39.062
Uh, my abuelita's.

05:39.097 --> 05:42.883
Bring No-doze and tell Nacho
to bring his van.

06:14.437 --> 06:16.270
Open up! Officer of the court!

06:16.272 --> 06:17.354
Open up in the name of the law!

06:20.910 --> 06:23.077
Good afternoon. This...

06:27.950 --> 06:29.533
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm showing hands.

06:29.585 --> 06:35.039
I'm... I'm relaxed... okay?...
Um, non-threatening.

06:38.761 --> 06:41.545
You move, and you're dead.

06:41.597 --> 06:43.964
Got it.

06:45.551 --> 06:47.518
Seems to be a misunderstanding.

06:47.553 --> 06:51.138
Is there, by any chance,
a Betsy kettleman here?

06:51.140 --> 06:52.773
See, I'm not sure if this is a situation

06:52.808 --> 06:55.643
where I should or should not
look you in the eye.

06:55.645 --> 06:57.144
Sit.

07:01.317 --> 07:04.285
Who are you?

07:04.320 --> 07:06.203
Are you with those redheaded scumbags?

07:06.239 --> 07:09.039
My name's James McGill. I'm an attorney.

07:09.075 --> 07:11.575
Uh, I got a call from some clients, uh,

07:11.627 --> 07:13.827
said something about an accident.

07:13.829 --> 07:16.330
I did not get any details.

07:16.332 --> 07:19.333
When I saw some skateboards
in your front yard,

07:19.335 --> 07:20.968
I assumed they might...

07:21.003 --> 07:23.587
Mijo...

07:23.801 --> 07:27.101
_

07:27.600 --> 07:32.100
_

07:32.800 --> 07:37.300
_

07:38.300 --> 07:46.100
_

07:46.200 --> 07:52.000
_

07:52.702 --> 07:53.634
Si, si.

07:53.701 --> 07:55.701
_

07:55.800 --> 08:01.300
_

08:12.388 --> 08:13.887
Talk.

08:13.889 --> 08:18.309
I'm gonna make an educated guess
what happened here.

08:18.361 --> 08:20.944
My two clients,
frick and frack, the mopheads,

08:20.980 --> 08:24.565
were in a simple traffic
accident, a minor Fender bender,

08:24.567 --> 08:26.400
but maybe they were
on the wrong side of the street,

08:26.402 --> 08:27.901
or they didn't look both ways.

08:27.903 --> 08:31.322
It could happen to anyone.

08:31.374 --> 08:34.325
My clients, exhibiting
extremely poor judgment,

08:34.376 --> 08:36.159
uh, followed your grandmother

08:36.212 --> 08:38.379
to this delightful, well-tended home.

08:39.582 --> 08:41.749
Now, at this juncture, I'm deducing

08:41.751 --> 08:44.468
that they said or did something
that... Crossed a line,

08:44.503 --> 08:47.254
and you, with some justification...

08:47.256 --> 08:49.256
You put them in their place.

08:51.010 --> 08:55.479
Based on the salsa stain there,
could have gone a couple ways.

08:55.514 --> 08:58.349
The bottom line... not to be morbid,

08:58.401 --> 09:02.603
but if they're dead,
um, I'm guessing that I'm...

09:04.407 --> 09:06.607
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
Yeah, I'm gonna go

09:06.609 --> 09:09.443
with glass half full here
and say they're not.

09:09.445 --> 09:12.613
Uh, my point is, if they're
still alive, why kill us? Why?

09:12.615 --> 09:14.832
Because of a misunderstanding?
Our own stupidity?

09:14.867 --> 09:16.750
Why mess up your lovely abuelita's place?

09:18.204 --> 09:20.170
Why jump to the nuclear option?

09:20.206 --> 09:22.172
See, I'm saying keep it simple.

09:22.208 --> 09:25.376
I will collect my moronic clients, and...

09:25.428 --> 09:27.211
Poof! We are gone.

09:27.263 --> 09:29.213
Neither you nor your lovely abuelita

09:29.265 --> 09:31.932
will ever lay eyes on us
ever again, guaranteed...

09:31.967 --> 09:35.636
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

09:37.890 --> 09:41.308
Assuming, you know,
that they're still breathing.

09:48.401 --> 09:51.218
Wow.

09:51.253 --> 09:54.988
You got a mouth on you.

09:55.024 --> 09:58.325
Thank you.

10:00.162 --> 10:03.330
Get up.

10:06.669 --> 10:08.085
That way.

10:08.137 --> 10:12.089
- That way.
- Y... Yeah, sure. Why not?

10:27.940 --> 10:32.326
So, what... I should cut 'em loose?

10:42.037 --> 10:45.255
Oh! It was him! It was all his idea!

10:45.291 --> 10:46.457
No, no, no!

10:46.509 --> 10:48.625
You shut up!

10:48.677 --> 10:50.761
Say what?

10:50.796 --> 10:52.179
He... he wanted to scam you.

10:52.214 --> 10:55.766
He said we could clear 2 grand, easy.

10:57.853 --> 11:00.471
You punking me?

11:09.648 --> 11:12.816
Are you punking my abuelita?

11:12.868 --> 11:14.451
He hit his head.

11:14.487 --> 11:15.903
He doesn't know what he's saying.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.215
For what?

11:28.250 --> 11:31.335
For what are you getting 2 grand?

11:31.387 --> 11:33.004
It was for going after your grandma,

11:33.086 --> 11:35.870
just for taking a header over
her car and then b-bracing her.

11:35.922 --> 11:38.039
It was him, I swear! It was the lawyer!

12:12.386 --> 12:13.919
Who are you?! Why are you after me?!

12:13.921 --> 12:16.305
I can explain. It's... you're gonna laugh.

12:16.340 --> 12:19.091
It's so... I'm a lawyer.
I... check my I.D., okay?

12:19.093 --> 12:20.726
But I was running a scam.

12:20.761 --> 12:22.094
- On my abuelita?
- No, no!

12:22.096 --> 12:23.929
Not on your abuelita, not on you.

12:23.931 --> 12:26.148
There's a woman named Betsy Kettleman.

12:26.183 --> 12:27.349
I mentioned her.

12:27.401 --> 12:28.767
She's married to Craig Kettleman.

12:28.769 --> 12:30.569
He's the treasurer of Bernalillo County.

12:30.605 --> 12:32.071
I wanted his business 'cause...

12:32.106 --> 12:34.356
He stole a million and
a half bucks from the county.

12:34.408 --> 12:37.826
He's gonna be indicted
for embezzlement any day now.

12:37.862 --> 12:39.828
This is a good case for me...
A lot of publicity.

12:39.864 --> 12:42.448
I'll get my name out, and...

12:42.450 --> 12:45.084
Anyway, I thought if I had these two

12:45.119 --> 12:47.703
run their little skateboard
hustle on Mrs. Kettleman,

12:47.755 --> 12:49.705
I could, you know, rescue her.

12:49.757 --> 12:52.291
Come in, throw some oil on troubled waters,

12:52.293 --> 12:53.509
and, yeah, I'd get their business.

12:53.544 --> 12:54.927
That was the plan.

12:54.962 --> 12:57.546
But it turns out your lovely abuelita...

12:57.598 --> 12:58.964
She drives a car...

12:58.966 --> 13:01.383
That's a whole lot like the Kettle-mobile.

13:01.435 --> 13:06.055
So, these two geniuses ran their
little stunt on the wrong one.

13:06.107 --> 13:07.690
So, joke's on me. Ha ha!

13:07.725 --> 13:09.892
I... simple as that.

13:17.151 --> 13:20.986
Where's he going? W..

13:20.988 --> 13:22.538
Talk to me, okay?

13:23.958 --> 13:27.826
Who do you think I am? What is he getting?

13:29.497 --> 13:31.463
I was running a scam to get a client.

13:31.499 --> 13:33.465
I made a mistake. That's all this is.

13:33.501 --> 13:36.302
Oh, geez.

13:36.337 --> 13:39.722
Y-you don't need...

13:39.757 --> 13:43.142
That's not... I'll talk, okay?

13:43.177 --> 13:47.146
Tell me what you want to know!

13:47.181 --> 13:49.765
Who do... who do you think I am?

13:49.817 --> 13:51.400
Hey, use your words, okay?

13:51.435 --> 13:52.818
What?

13:52.853 --> 13:55.654
You know what I smell?

13:55.690 --> 13:59.074
I smell lies.

13:59.110 --> 14:00.576
I smell pork.

14:00.611 --> 14:03.162
No, that's not necessary.

14:03.197 --> 14:06.281
Okay, we know you're with
the heat. The question is, who?

14:06.334 --> 14:07.700
- Local? FBI?
- No, no, no.

14:07.702 --> 14:09.335
D.E.A.?! No, I'm a lawyer.

14:09.370 --> 14:12.338
Just reach in my pocket
right now... right there!

14:20.014 --> 14:22.598
Truth.

14:24.218 --> 14:25.968
That is the truth!

14:26.020 --> 14:28.804
I'm a lawyer! Guys, I passed
the bar! Ask me anything!

14:28.856 --> 14:32.875
Not contract law, okay? I'm down
at the courts every day!

14:32.955 --> 14:34.221
People know me!

14:34.255 --> 14:35.722
I'm a known quantity... I am!

14:35.757 --> 14:37.557
Aah!

14:37.592 --> 14:41.761
I'm... I'm special agent
Jeffrey Steele, FBI.

14:41.763 --> 14:43.846
- FBI?
- FBI?

14:43.898 --> 14:45.481
I'm undercover, okay? You got me.

14:46.396 --> 14:47.078
I'm the tip of the spear,

14:47.095 --> 14:50.062
and releasing me would be the smart move.

14:50.098 --> 14:52.064
You hear that shit?

14:52.900 --> 14:57.285
I told you the business was too good.

14:57.321 --> 14:59.905
I knew it. I told you.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.586
Can I?

15:05.092 --> 15:09.260
Okay, uh, Special Agent, uh, Steele?

15:09.262 --> 15:11.096
Jeffrey A. Steele.

15:11.098 --> 15:13.314
Okay, Agent Steele,
what business are we in?

15:13.350 --> 15:14.432
Business?

15:14.434 --> 15:16.434
You're investigating us, right?

15:16.436 --> 15:19.604
For what? What did we do?

15:19.606 --> 15:21.606
- What do we sell?
- Drugs.

15:21.608 --> 15:26.611
- What kind of drugs?
- Uh...It's title 21,

15:26.613 --> 15:29.614
schedule II through schedule V,
including part "B."

15:29.616 --> 15:31.616
That's what we call them
down at the bureau.

15:31.618 --> 15:33.618
It's... the task force

15:33.620 --> 15:35.453
is designated "Operation King Breaker."

15:35.455 --> 15:37.872
"King Breaker"? So...

15:37.924 --> 15:41.509
That makes me the king! Whoo-hoo!

15:41.545 --> 15:42.761
Can I?

15:46.566 --> 15:48.967
All right.

15:50.971 --> 15:54.656
The next words out of your mouth
got to be the truth.

15:54.670 --> 15:56.253
You understand?

15:56.255 --> 15:58.088
Uh-huh.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.923
Who are you?

16:06.560 --> 16:08.644
I'm James Morgan McGill. I'm a lawyer.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.627
I was trolling for business,
okay? That's the truth.

16:10.662 --> 16:12.245
Now, you find a Bible, I'll swear on it.

16:12.247 --> 16:14.664
Okay, what about, uh, operation,
uh, King Breaker, FBI?

16:14.716 --> 16:17.300
I made it up, okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:17.336 --> 16:20.303
I don't know you. I don't want to.

16:20.339 --> 16:24.724
Uh, this was a mistake, oka...
It's my mistake, okay?

16:24.760 --> 16:27.143
I take full and complete responsibility,

16:27.179 --> 16:30.730
but I don't know any of your names,

16:30.766 --> 16:33.149
and I got a bad case of face-blindness.

16:33.185 --> 16:35.101
You let us go, we're gonna
forget this happened.

16:35.103 --> 16:36.486
Guys, we're gonna forget, right?

16:36.521 --> 16:38.321
Nod your heads.

16:38.357 --> 16:39.739
Okay?

16:39.775 --> 16:43.577
So, if you just let us go and just...

16:43.612 --> 16:46.780
We want to just go... home.

17:00.929 --> 17:03.880
I say cut 'em loose.

17:03.932 --> 17:07.717
He said he was FBI. He admitted it.

17:07.769 --> 17:09.935
You had your wire cutters on him.

17:09.972 --> 17:12.472
He would have said anything.

17:12.473 --> 17:15.474
You really see the FBI
hiring those two flaquitos?

17:17.445 --> 17:19.813
Maybe.

17:21.817 --> 17:26.036
Croaking a lawyer
for no reason is bad business.

17:26.070 --> 17:28.655
He goes away, someone's
gonna come look for him.

17:28.657 --> 17:31.658
They walked into my house.

17:31.660 --> 17:34.661
They disrespected my abuelita.

17:34.663 --> 17:36.663
They call her "biznatch"!

17:37.799 --> 17:41.167
And they just walk?! Unh-unh!

17:46.591 --> 17:49.759
What about the lawyer?

17:51.430 --> 17:53.430
He's giving respect.

17:55.767 --> 17:57.767
Okay.

18:02.658 --> 18:07.027
"James M. McGill.

18:07.029 --> 18:09.496
A lawyer you can trust."

18:13.118 --> 18:15.702
I know how to find you, James McGill.

18:15.704 --> 18:18.338
Understand what I'm saying?

18:18.373 --> 18:19.956
Yeah.

18:27.466 --> 18:29.849
Up.

18:33.722 --> 18:36.690
Okay?

18:36.725 --> 18:40.310
Take him back to his car.

18:40.362 --> 18:41.728
Thank you.

18:41.730 --> 18:43.947
Uh, uh, this is... this is good.

18:43.982 --> 18:46.149
This... this is right. Thank you. Come on.

18:48.403 --> 18:50.870
What... what... what about them?

18:50.906 --> 18:52.288
- Come on.
- Yeah, right.

18:52.324 --> 18:55.158
- Come on.
- Uh, yeah, right.

19:03.051 --> 19:05.835
- Whoa. Uh...
- Yo, where you going?

19:05.887 --> 19:07.003
Uh, wait. Can I... can I say something?

19:07.055 --> 19:08.722
- Where you going?
- Can you let them go?

19:08.757 --> 19:11.508
- Just let them go.
- Are you stupid?

19:11.560 --> 19:14.728
They don't deserve to die.
I put them up to it.

19:14.763 --> 19:17.230
I don't deserve to die,
but they don't, either.

19:17.265 --> 19:20.850
I'm gonna skin them, like javelinas!

19:20.902 --> 19:22.485
Forget about them! They're insects!

19:22.521 --> 19:25.438
They're... hey, think about their mother.

19:27.943 --> 19:30.360
I spit on their mama!

19:30.412 --> 19:32.695
She is a sweet little lady.
She... she's a widow.

19:32.748 --> 19:36.533
She works hard all day, every day,

19:36.585 --> 19:39.536
just like her mother before her,
from dawn till dusk,

19:39.588 --> 19:42.372
scrubbing the floors of rich people.

19:42.424 --> 19:44.591
She needs a cane to walk, you know?

19:44.626 --> 19:48.428
She's got arthritis.
And still, she works every day.

19:48.463 --> 19:50.380
What... for herself? No. No.

19:50.432 --> 19:55.602
For them... for these two,
her boys, her apples of her eye.

19:55.637 --> 19:57.804
You say they don't deserve her?

19:57.806 --> 20:01.808
Maybe so, but they're all she's got.

20:01.810 --> 20:05.445
Now...You turn them inside out,

20:05.480 --> 20:07.197
I want you to think
about what happens to her.

20:07.232 --> 20:08.448
No, that's on them.

20:08.483 --> 20:09.866
They should have thought about that.

20:09.901 --> 20:11.901
When I was at your abuelita's place,

20:11.953 --> 20:13.536
you were gonna let them go.

20:13.572 --> 20:16.739
Way I see it, that's because
you're tough, but you're fair.

20:16.792 --> 20:18.625
You're all about justice.

20:18.660 --> 20:22.829
That's what I'm saying... justice.

20:22.831 --> 20:24.664
These... these two shit-for-brains?

20:24.666 --> 20:26.166
These big-mouths?

20:26.168 --> 20:28.001
You... you already beat
the living hell out of them.

20:28.003 --> 20:30.386
Do you think they're ever
gonna forget today?

20:30.422 --> 20:31.838
Never... 10 years from now,

20:31.840 --> 20:34.474
they're still gonna
be crapping their jockeys.

20:34.509 --> 20:37.894
- It's not enough.
- Okay, okay.

20:37.929 --> 20:41.181
Then let's talk proportionality.
They're guilty... oh, agreed.

20:42.934 --> 20:46.686
Now you have to decide,
what's the right sentence?

20:46.688 --> 20:49.823
Like a judge.

20:49.858 --> 20:52.659
Like a judge.

20:52.694 --> 20:54.861
Ever hear of the code of Hammurabi...

20:54.863 --> 20:57.747
Let the punishment
fit the crime, eye for an eye?

20:57.782 --> 21:00.083
Eye for an eye.

21:00.118 --> 21:01.167
You want me to blind them.

21:01.203 --> 21:02.335
No, no.

21:02.370 --> 21:04.871
All they did was trash-talk.

21:04.873 --> 21:06.789
So I cut their tongues out!

21:06.842 --> 21:10.009
Wait. See, I'm advising...

21:10.045 --> 21:12.846
That you make the punishment fit the crime.

21:14.299 --> 21:16.799
Punishment fit the crime.

21:16.852 --> 21:20.019
Columbian neckties... I cut their throats,

21:20.055 --> 21:24.057
and then I pull their
lying tongues through the slits!

21:24.059 --> 21:25.441
"Biznatch"!

21:25.477 --> 21:27.861
Or you... you could give them black eyes.

21:27.896 --> 21:31.397
Black eyes? That ain't nothing.

21:31.399 --> 21:33.616
That one there, homes...

21:33.652 --> 21:36.069
He already got a black eye, fool.

21:42.410 --> 21:45.995
Stop helping.

21:46.047 --> 21:48.998
Or you could sprain their ankles.

21:49.050 --> 21:50.833
- Sprain?
- They're... they'reskateboarders, right?

21:50.886 --> 21:52.669
That... that's how they run their scam.

21:52.721 --> 21:54.504
They can't skate.

21:54.556 --> 21:57.340
You... you hit them where they live.

21:57.392 --> 22:00.560
I ain't spraining nothing, bitch.

22:00.595 --> 22:03.846
I'm gonna break their arms,
and I'm gonna break their legs.

22:03.899 --> 22:05.848
Arms? When... when...
When did we get on to arms?

22:05.901 --> 22:07.850
- Let's...
- I'm cutting their legs off.

22:07.903 --> 22:09.686
But... we could go that way,

22:09.738 --> 22:12.689
but...We were talking about breaking.

22:12.741 --> 22:14.407
I think we're heading
in the wrong direction.

22:14.442 --> 22:16.276
Okay.

22:18.113 --> 22:19.696
Break their legs.

22:19.748 --> 22:21.331
How many legs?

22:21.366 --> 22:22.916
Two... they got two legs.

22:22.951 --> 22:25.752
One leg... each.

22:25.787 --> 22:27.370
One leg... each?

22:27.422 --> 22:29.005
They're...

22:29.040 --> 22:32.842
One leg each, that's a total of two legs.

22:32.877 --> 22:35.261
Uh, hey, look.

22:35.297 --> 22:37.680
They can't skateboard for six months,

22:37.716 --> 22:39.882
and they're scared of you forever.

22:39.935 --> 22:41.718
You show everybody that you are the man,

22:41.770 --> 22:44.721
but that you're fair, that you're just.

22:55.734 --> 22:59.319
One leg each.

23:03.325 --> 23:07.710
That's tough, but it's fair.

23:07.746 --> 23:10.079
All right, lay 'em out!
I ain't got all day!

23:10.131 --> 23:11.914
It's hotter than shit out here!

23:20.675 --> 23:23.893
Quit moving...
You're only gonna make it worse!

23:23.928 --> 23:25.728
We're sorry! We're sorry!

23:26.982 --> 23:29.565
Lookit!

23:29.601 --> 23:32.402
Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!

23:32.437 --> 23:35.405
He said he had a broke leg...
Now he's got one for real!

23:35.440 --> 23:39.409
You... tell your mama you're sorry, bitch!

23:39.444 --> 23:41.411
Other one.

23:41.446 --> 23:44.614
Look... it's backwards.

23:47.502 --> 23:48.868
Check it out.

23:48.870 --> 23:51.087
I'm gonna do this one real clean.

23:51.122 --> 23:53.506
No! Oh, my God! No!

23:53.541 --> 23:57.343
Whoo!

23:57.379 --> 24:01.547
Walk home now, bitch!

24:02.801 --> 24:05.385
Shut up! Shut up!

24:27.628 --> 24:30.045
Here you go. Here you go. Easy, easy.

24:30.097 --> 24:32.264
- You... you... you... aah! Aah!
- Save your breath.

24:32.299 --> 24:33.983
You... you are... you are the worst lawyer,

24:33.998 --> 24:34.948
the worst lawyer ever!

24:34.996 --> 24:36.379
Hey, I just talked you down
from a death sentence...

24:36.414 --> 24:39.165
- Oh, my God! Oh, my!
- ...to six months' probation.

24:41.002 --> 24:42.802
I'm the best lawyer ever.

24:42.837 --> 24:45.805
Dude, dude, dude, oh!

24:45.840 --> 24:48.007
Oh, my God! Oh! No!

26:40.613 --> 26:42.229
Could you, uh...

26:42.281 --> 26:46.483
Could you, um... I'll be right back.

27:11.844 --> 27:13.677
Ground yourself?

27:19.685 --> 27:22.102
Jimmy, did you ground yourself?

27:36.502 --> 27:39.670
Ohh.

27:39.705 --> 27:42.539
I don't think you grounded yourself.

27:47.546 --> 27:50.130
Jesus.

27:50.182 --> 27:54.551
Jimmy, you didn't drive like this, did you?

27:59.975 --> 28:02.559
Oh, no.

28:05.147 --> 28:08.732
No. I knew it.

28:23.082 --> 28:25.716
Ohh.

28:43.936 --> 28:47.738
Ah. Oh.

28:47.773 --> 28:49.573
Aah.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.467
Chuck.

29:52.254 --> 29:55.055
Coffee?

29:55.090 --> 29:58.675
Yeah, thanks.

29:58.677 --> 30:00.394
You're gonna have to take it black.

30:00.429 --> 30:02.179
We're out of milk?

30:03.849 --> 30:07.067
Oh, sorry.

30:21.951 --> 30:25.118
Why are you in that space blanket?

30:25.170 --> 30:27.754
You brought your cellphone
in here last night.

30:27.790 --> 30:31.174
It was in your pants pocket.

30:31.210 --> 30:32.626
Oh.

30:32.678 --> 30:37.464
Sorry about that.

30:37.516 --> 30:40.467
Where, uh... where is it?

30:40.519 --> 30:42.853
Outside... I threw it out the door.

30:42.888 --> 30:45.722
Yeah.

30:51.897 --> 30:54.731
How did I get here?

30:54.733 --> 30:57.734
Your car's not outside,
so I'm assuming taxi.

30:59.405 --> 31:03.373
Right.

31:03.409 --> 31:07.377
Uh, the bartender... wouldn't let me drive.

31:20.676 --> 31:24.478
Why are you in that space blanket?

31:24.513 --> 31:29.433
I told you... you brought
your cellphone into my house.

31:33.072 --> 31:36.857
Uh, Chuck, um, did you...

31:38.527 --> 31:40.410
Chuck, did you read this?

31:40.446 --> 31:43.613
Read what?

31:43.615 --> 31:47.534
Uh, this, um, this bill... did you read it?

31:47.586 --> 31:51.755
Emergency-room bill...
Yeah, I may have glanced at it.

31:51.790 --> 31:53.540
It fell out of your pocket.

31:55.761 --> 31:59.546
Hey, Chuck, listen,
I... I know how this looks.

31:59.598 --> 32:01.548
I'm down to my last dime, and, suddenly,

32:01.600 --> 32:04.184
I'm paying for broken legs, but...

32:04.219 --> 32:06.603
It's... it's not that.

32:06.638 --> 32:10.223
I swear.

32:10.275 --> 32:14.644
This represents a good thing, ultimately.

32:14.646 --> 32:16.697
Okay.

32:16.732 --> 32:20.117
I... I'm not backsliding.
This isn't slippin' Jimmy.

32:20.152 --> 32:21.618
Fine.

32:25.157 --> 32:28.992
Take off the space blanket,
will you, please, Chuck?

32:28.994 --> 32:31.628
It helps.

32:31.663 --> 32:34.247
Take off the space blanket.
I didn't do anything wrong.

32:34.299 --> 32:38.301
It has nothing to do with that.
It was your phone.

32:41.340 --> 32:44.174
Take off the space blanket.

32:45.844 --> 32:49.012
Why?

32:51.433 --> 32:54.401
Take off the space blanket, Chuck.

32:54.436 --> 32:57.938
Come on. Take off the blanket.

33:09.868 --> 33:11.451
Thank you.

33:17.126 --> 33:18.508
Front yard?

33:18.544 --> 33:20.260
Mm.

33:22.214 --> 33:25.132
Uh, do you have any idea where it landed?

33:25.184 --> 33:26.967
No.

33:52.578 --> 33:54.995
No.

33:55.047 --> 33:57.414
No.

33:57.416 --> 33:59.749
No.

33:59.751 --> 34:02.385
No.

34:06.175 --> 34:09.342
No. No.

34:09.393 --> 34:11.261
No.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.817
What do you want?

34:16.851 --> 34:20.353
Not to starve to death.

34:20.405 --> 34:22.938
What do you say?

34:22.940 --> 34:26.525
Got something for me?

34:47.386 --> 34:50.353
It's showtime, folks.

35:04.820 --> 35:07.070
Globis, lawyer.

35:07.072 --> 35:08.622
I'm gonna kill him.

35:08.657 --> 35:11.207
"Your honor, I'm very sorry.
I'll never do it again."

35:11.243 --> 35:12.959
- Say what?!
- Just...

35:12.995 --> 35:15.962
Your honor, I'm very sorry,
and I'll never do it again.

35:15.998 --> 35:17.547
Okay, Mr. Pearson, up you go.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.382
Up you go. All right.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.051
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

35:21.086 --> 35:23.887
- What's this?
- I told you a suit, remember?

35:23.922 --> 35:25.555
Told you you want to look sharp.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.425
That's a loaner, okay?
I need it back. Let's go.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.260
- Petty with a prior.
- The kid took a slice of pizza.

35:30.262 --> 35:32.312
- Petty with a prior.
- Look, the parents are a train wreck.

35:32.347 --> 35:33.897
There's no food in the house!
He was hungry!

35:33.932 --> 35:35.348
- Petty with a prior.
- Come on!

35:45.611 --> 35:47.577
- You're light on stickers.
- Come on.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.245
- $5.
- You serious?

35:49.281 --> 35:50.997
You got four. You need five.

35:51.033 --> 35:53.016
There's four 90-minute stickers there.

35:53.051 --> 35:55.185
You've been here 6 hours and 5 minutes.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.170
It takes 10 minutes to walk down here!

35:57.205 --> 36:00.757
$5, or you go get another sticker.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.878
This makes you feel real important, huh?!

36:04.930 --> 36:07.547
Not enough stickers! More stickers!

36:13.388 --> 36:15.105
It's showtime, folks.

36:18.443 --> 36:20.310
It's showtime.

36:45.137 --> 36:46.803
Petty with a prior.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.505
Prior will stay on his sheet for life.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.056
Petty with a prior.

36:50.092 --> 36:52.809
You're overcharging him.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.394
Petty with a prior.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.599
That lady up there...
She shorts me every time, okay?

36:59.651 --> 37:03.820
This is not a me problem...
This is a you problem.

37:07.325 --> 37:09.109
It's showtime.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.830
What? It's from a movie.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.539
Hey!

37:30.966 --> 37:33.299
- Petty with a prior.
- Misdemeanor shoplifting.

37:33.351 --> 37:35.719
- Petty with a prior.
- Come on. Meet me halfway.

37:35.721 --> 37:38.104
- Petty with a prior.
- I can't do it.

37:38.140 --> 37:40.106
- Petty with a prior.
- Okay, or how about this?

37:40.142 --> 37:41.725
I plead the kid to the sheet,

37:41.727 --> 37:43.143
but you give me a continued sentence.

37:43.195 --> 37:44.978
And in six months, if he's still clean,

37:45.030 --> 37:46.529
you file for a dismissal.

37:46.565 --> 37:49.733
Come on. Is this how
you want to spend your time?

37:49.735 --> 37:51.317
You can have the rest of these.

38:03.548 --> 38:05.882
Berger, lawyer.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.585
Oh, Mr. Berger,
we've met before, haven't we?

38:08.587 --> 38:11.554
Mr. Edison, like the inventor?
I'm James McGill.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.089
I'll be your lawyer.

38:13.091 --> 38:15.725
Doesn't matter. Judge has
got to see your mother.

38:15.761 --> 38:18.561
Well, do you know anybody
who looks like her?

38:18.597 --> 38:20.730
No, an Uncle won't do it.

38:20.766 --> 38:24.067
Okay, so, a fire was started.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.351
We all know that.

38:25.403 --> 38:27.737
Freezing, shivering, as she is now.

38:27.773 --> 38:30.573
In fact, wrote a book about it.

38:30.609 --> 38:33.576
To make some cookies.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.995
But because you...
...Given her this name...

38:36.031 --> 38:40.450
You can see that this man...
Chose... A bonehead move.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.471
Like a troll under a bridge!

39:01.473 --> 39:04.474
"You must have the stickers,
or you won't pass!"

39:04.476 --> 39:06.976
Troll alert here... don't feed it!

39:20.242 --> 39:22.041
Chao chi c'ung, ladies.

39:23.295 --> 39:25.078
Good evening, Mrs. Nguyen.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.296
No mail.

39:26.331 --> 39:28.832
Hey, Vicki, Maggie.

40:04.703 --> 40:09.122
You have...Zero messages.

41:11.937 --> 41:13.770
Customer.

41:13.772 --> 41:16.406
- What?
- For you... a customer, waiting now.

41:16.441 --> 41:19.275
Oh, uh, sure, sure. Uh, give me a minute.

41:45.303 --> 41:47.520
Welcome, welcome.
My office is being painted.

41:47.555 --> 41:51.941
Excuse the temporary, uh...Quarters.

41:51.977 --> 41:55.812
Wow. Cozy.

41:57.983 --> 42:00.817
Just me.

42:00.819 --> 42:04.454
Tuco freaked you out, huh?

42:04.489 --> 42:08.124
It's cool. He doesn't know I'm here.

42:22.640 --> 42:27.010
So, uh... what can I do for you?

42:29.180 --> 42:31.180
I've been thinking about what you said

42:31.182 --> 42:33.599
out there in the desert.

42:33.651 --> 42:35.018
Those people
that you were trying to scam...

42:35.020 --> 42:36.986
How much did they steal?

42:37.022 --> 42:42.825
Um, north of a million
and a half bucks... I think.

42:42.861 --> 42:49.198
So, they have a million
and a half bucks somewhere.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.199
In what, cash?

42:50.201 --> 42:52.535
I don't... well...

42:52.537 --> 42:55.171
Why are you asking me?

42:55.206 --> 42:59.008
- I'm gonna rip them off.
- Oh.

42:59.044 --> 43:00.843
I like ripping off thieves

43:00.879 --> 43:04.213
'cause they can't go to the
cops... they have no recourse.

43:04.215 --> 43:05.848
Mm.

43:05.884 --> 43:08.684
You point me
at where they have their cash...

43:08.720 --> 43:10.686
I'll pay you... a what do you call it?...

43:10.722 --> 43:15.641
A finder's fee... call it 10%, 100 large.

43:17.896 --> 43:22.281
Well, uh, why w... why would you
come to me for that?

43:22.317 --> 43:25.485
You already tried ripping them off.

43:25.537 --> 43:28.037
I'm gonna finish what you started.

43:28.073 --> 43:29.872
I... I wasn't trying to rip them off.

43:29.908 --> 43:31.707
I... I just wanted their business.

43:31.743 --> 43:35.128
Okay.

43:35.163 --> 43:36.963
I don't know where their money is.

43:36.998 --> 43:39.382
Smart guy like you could figure it out.

43:39.417 --> 43:42.218
If I know what I need to know,
nobody gets hurt.

43:42.253 --> 43:44.637
We rip them off... easy money.

43:44.672 --> 43:48.391
Hey, look, I'm a lawyer, not a criminal.

43:52.847 --> 43:54.347
You are shitting me.

43:54.399 --> 43:57.567
I crossed a line. I made a mistake.

43:57.602 --> 43:59.986
I'm not doing that again, not ever.

44:00.021 --> 44:03.189
I got between you and tuco.

44:03.241 --> 44:06.576
Do you think you'd be here
now... I kept my mouth shut?

44:06.611 --> 44:10.780
And I appreciate that. I owe you.

44:10.782 --> 44:14.784
A-and if you're ever in trouble,
God forbid, legal trouble,

44:14.786 --> 44:18.921
I will be there, 24-7, as a lawyer.

44:18.957 --> 44:21.290
What's your angle?

44:21.292 --> 44:25.294
No... no angle.

44:25.296 --> 44:28.931
And I'm not saying anything
about this to anybody.

44:28.967 --> 44:31.767
As far as I'm concerned, you're a client.

44:31.803 --> 44:33.386
This is a consultation,

44:33.438 --> 44:36.973
and everything you just told me
is privileged.

44:36.975 --> 44:39.609
You rat, you die.

44:39.644 --> 44:42.645
And that, too, yes.

45:04.252 --> 45:07.420
For when you figure out you're in the game.

45:07.472 --> 45:09.005
I'm not in the game.

45:09.007 --> 45:11.474
I... I promise.
