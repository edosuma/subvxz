00:34.349 --> 00:36.434
WOW. I DON'T KNOW
WHO THIS BROWN BETTY IS,

00:36.502 --> 00:39.337
BUT SHE KNOWS HER WAY
AROUND AN APPLE.

00:39.405 --> 00:40.605
CAN I HAVE A BITE?

00:44.944 --> 00:46.444
OH, MY GOD.

00:46.512 --> 00:49.180
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.

00:51.951 --> 00:55.153
MMM! MMM, THAT'S GOOD!

00:55.221 --> 00:56.421
HOW GREAT IS THIS PLACE?

00:56.489 --> 00:57.789
THE GREATEST!
OFF THE HOOK,

00:57.857 --> 00:59.273
AS THE KIDS
LIKE TO SAY.

00:59.341 --> 01:01.693
I MEAN, THE AMBIENCE,
THE VIEW.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.462
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE SUN
GOING DOWN OVER THAT BLUFF.

01:03.529 --> 01:05.230
AND YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
BEEN A BIG FAN

01:05.298 --> 01:08.349
OF THE "SUNSET,"
BUT THAT'S PRETTY GREAT.

01:08.417 --> 01:11.185
HOW LUCKY WERE WE JUST
TO STUMBLE ONTO THIS SPOT?

01:11.253 --> 01:14.105
THANK GOD THERE WAS A
SHOOTING AT THAT WAFFLE PLACE.

01:19.979 --> 01:21.529
HUH.

01:21.564 --> 01:22.830
THAT WAS WEIRD.

01:22.898 --> 01:24.015
WHAT?

01:24.083 --> 01:25.550
I DON'T KNOW. I-

01:25.617 --> 01:27.251
WHEN I KISSED YOU, MY
HEART WAS BEATING ALL FAST,

01:27.319 --> 01:29.754
AND-I DON'T KNOW-
FELT ALL WARM INSIDE.

01:29.822 --> 01:32.991
YOU THINK SOMETHING
WAS WRONG WITH THE SHRIMP?

01:33.058 --> 01:35.109
NO.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

01:35.177 --> 01:37.044
I THINK IT'S LOVE.

01:37.112 --> 01:39.998
SHUT UP!
I'M SERIOUS!

01:40.065 --> 01:41.899
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING
IT TO GET SEX FROM YOU.

01:41.967 --> 01:43.217
REALLY?
YEAH.

01:43.285 --> 01:44.602
I MEAN, IF YOU STARTED DOING STUFF TO ME

01:44.670 --> 01:46.204
UNDER THE TABLE, I
DON'T THINK I'D STOP YOU,

01:46.272 --> 01:48.372
BUT... IT'S
NOT ABOUT THAT.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.974
YOU KNOW,
I FEEL LIKE

01:50.042 --> 01:52.911
I'M FALLING IN LOVE
WITH YOU ALL OVER AGAIN.

01:52.978 --> 01:54.328
IN FACT, IF WE
WEREN'T MARRIED,

01:54.396 --> 01:57.481
I'D BE PROPOSING TO YOU
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

01:57.549 --> 01:58.717
OH!

01:58.784 --> 02:00.385
AND YOU'D BE LOOKING
INTO MY EYES SAYING,

02:00.453 --> 02:02.554
"GIVE ME A COUPLE OF
DAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT."

02:02.621 --> 02:04.055
STOP!

02:04.123 --> 02:06.741
HEY, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE AN IDEA.

02:06.809 --> 02:08.893
EH, FORGET IT.
IT'S STUPID.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.495
WHAT?

02:10.562 --> 02:12.397
I WAS JUST THINKING,
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD

02:12.464 --> 02:13.731
RENEW OUR VOWS, YOU KNOW?

02:13.799 --> 02:16.467
HAVE, LIKE,
A WHOLE CEREMONY HERE.

02:16.535 --> 02:17.935
ON THE BLUFF.

02:18.003 --> 02:19.454
I DON'T LOVE IT.
YOU DON'T?

02:19.521 --> 02:21.722
I SUPER LOVE IT!

02:21.790 --> 02:23.774
REALLY? HOW GREAT
IS THIS GONNA BE?

02:23.843 --> 02:26.077
WE'LL INVITE ALL
OUR FRIENDS, OUR FAMILY,

02:26.145 --> 02:28.980
WE'LL GET IT CATERED, WE'LL
HAVE SOMEONE PLAYING THE FLUTE.

02:29.048 --> 02:30.281
HEY, I CAN FINALLY
GET MY MONKEY.

02:33.035 --> 02:35.236
WHAT'S THAT, BABY?

02:35.304 --> 02:36.587
REMEMBER AT OUR WEDDING,
I ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE

02:36.655 --> 02:37.655
A MONKEY WALK
DOWN THE AISLE

02:37.723 --> 02:39.690
AND HAND ME
THE RING.

02:39.758 --> 02:42.210
YEAH. YEAH!

02:42.278 --> 02:45.513
NO REASON YOU CAN'T HAVE
YOUR MONKEY THIS TIME.

02:45.580 --> 02:47.682
SWEET.

02:51.136 --> 02:54.138
DARLING, ALLOW ME
TO HEARKEN YOU BACK

02:54.207 --> 02:56.341
TO A BLEAK
DECEMBER DAY

02:56.409 --> 02:58.076
IN THE MIDST
OF WORLD WAR II

02:58.143 --> 03:00.979
WHEN A YOUNG ARTHUR
SPOONER SAVED THE LIFE

03:01.047 --> 03:04.181
OF A FELLOW SOLDIER
NAMED RUSTY BUBBICO.

03:04.249 --> 03:06.784
OK, IS THIS
A RANDOM HEARKENING,

03:06.852 --> 03:08.586
OR ARE YOU GOING
SOMEWHERE WITH THIS?

03:08.653 --> 03:10.338
OK, I'M GOING
SOMEWHERE.

03:10.405 --> 03:12.023
OK.

03:12.091 --> 03:16.461
WE VISITED THE RED
LIGHT DISTRICT ONE NIGHT,

03:16.529 --> 03:20.565
AND I FRONTED HIM
A PROPHYLACTIC.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.535
GONORRHEA WAS THE FLAVOR
OF THE MONTH BACK THEN.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.754
SO IT'S A LOVE STORY.

03:25.821 --> 03:28.039
HEH HEH! IT IS NOW.

03:28.107 --> 03:29.974
HE GAVE ME A FINE
BOTTLE OF PORT WINE

03:30.042 --> 03:31.843
AS HIS WAY
OF SAYING THANKS.

03:31.910 --> 03:33.578
I'VE BEEN SAVING IT
ALL THESE YEARS,

03:33.646 --> 03:34.912
AND I'VE DECIDED TO
GIVE IT TO YOU TWO

03:34.980 --> 03:36.948
ON THE DAY
YOU RENEW YOUR VOWS.

03:37.015 --> 03:39.800
OH! THAT'S VERY GENEROUS.
THANK YOU, DAD.

03:39.868 --> 03:41.685
MY PLEASURE,
DARLING.

03:43.088 --> 03:45.140
OK, MA, WELL,
IT'S 3 WEEKS FROM TODAY,

03:45.207 --> 03:47.375
SO YOU BETTER START
WORKING ON A FLIGHT OUT.

03:47.442 --> 03:49.944
WE WILL. JOE,
WE SHOULD USE OUR MILES.

03:50.011 --> 03:51.546
I'M SURE THAT WEEKEND
WILL BE BLACKED OUT.

03:51.613 --> 03:52.847
THEY ALWAYS BLACK OUT
THE WEEKENDS

03:52.914 --> 03:54.682
WE WANT TO USE
THE MILES.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.417
WE'LL BE THERE
WITH BELLS ON, DARLING.

03:56.485 --> 03:57.618
LIKE THAT YOGURT PLACE.

03:57.686 --> 03:59.471
THEY STOPPED TAKING
THOSE PUNCH CARDS

03:59.538 --> 04:01.288
JUST BEFORE I WAS DUE
FOR MY FREE CONE.

04:01.356 --> 04:02.690
IT'S ALL A SCAM.

04:02.758 --> 04:04.692
YEAH, I'M SURE
THAT THE YOGURT PLACE

04:04.760 --> 04:06.160
AND THE AIRLINES
ARE IN CAHOOTS.

04:06.228 --> 04:07.362
FOCUS, MA. OK?

04:07.429 --> 04:08.563
YOU GOT YOUR WHOLE LIFE
TO TALK TO HIM.

04:08.630 --> 04:10.715
SORRY, DEAR.
LISTEN, DON'T FORGET

04:10.783 --> 04:12.950
TO INVITE OUR FRIENDS SMITTY AND JULES.

04:13.018 --> 04:15.786
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO THEY ARE.

04:15.854 --> 04:17.522
YOU KNOW
SMITTY AND JULES.

04:17.589 --> 04:18.973
OK, NOT ONLY
DON'T I KNOW THEM,

04:19.041 --> 04:20.041
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHICH ONE'S THE MAN

04:20.108 --> 04:22.142
AND WHICH ONE'S
THE WOMAN.

04:22.211 --> 04:24.396
I'LL TELL THEM TO EXPECT AN INVITATION.

04:24.463 --> 04:25.846
OK, FINE, MA. ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

04:25.915 --> 04:27.382
I GOTTA GO. OK, BYE-BYE, SWEETHEART.

04:27.449 --> 04:29.384
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

04:29.451 --> 04:32.954
NOW BACK TO THE IMPORTANT
STUFF-FINDING US A MONKEY.

04:33.022 --> 04:35.540
MONKEY, MONKEY, MONKEY.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.493
"MIRRORS, MONEY ORDERS,
MONOGRAMS, MUFFLERS."

04:38.561 --> 04:39.627
WHERE'S "MONKEY"?

04:39.695 --> 04:42.163
HOW DOES MONKEY NOT HAVE,
LIKE, 2 FULL PAGES?

04:43.365 --> 04:45.967
YEAH, DOUG, ABOUT THE
WHOLE MONKEY THING,

04:46.035 --> 04:48.069
I WAS JUST THINKING
THAT, YOU KNOW,

04:48.137 --> 04:50.805
MAYBE A VOW RENEWAL
MONKEY IS A WASTE.

04:50.872 --> 04:52.640
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD
SAVE IT FOR SOMETHING

04:52.707 --> 04:53.841
A LITTLE BIT
MORE FESTIVE,

04:53.909 --> 04:55.310
LIKE A CINCO DE MAYO
MONKEY.

04:55.377 --> 04:57.445
YOU KNOW,
GET HIM A SOMBRERO,

04:57.512 --> 04:59.380
A LITTLE CAP GUN
SIX-SHOOTER.

04:59.448 --> 05:02.016
YOU KNOW-POW!
YOU KNOW?

05:02.084 --> 05:04.052
HMM. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T
KNOW IF I FEEL COMFORTABLE

05:04.120 --> 05:05.253
DEGRADING A MONKEY
THAT WAY.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.989
LET'S-LET'S
JUST STICK WITH THE PLAN.

05:08.257 --> 05:09.657
OK.

05:17.416 --> 05:20.485
IT'S OPEN.

05:20.552 --> 05:23.521
ARTHUR, YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T
LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED LIKE THAT.

05:23.588 --> 05:27.158
I MEAN, ANY FREAK CAN JUST
WALK IN OFF THE STREET.

05:28.977 --> 05:29.994
OH, VERY FUNNY.

05:30.062 --> 05:33.197
<i>UM, I'M RETURNING
CARRIE'S COPY OF THE HOURS.</i>

05:33.265 --> 05:36.368
LET HER KNOW I THOUGHT
IT WAS HAUNTING.

05:36.435 --> 05:38.570
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT THERE?

05:38.637 --> 05:40.405
A BOTTLE OF PORT I'M
GIVING TO DOUG AND CARRIE

05:40.473 --> 05:42.774
FOR THEIR VOW RENEWAL.
IT'S MY LITTLE WAY OF SAYING

05:42.842 --> 05:44.642
HOW SPECIAL
THEY ARE TO ME.

05:44.710 --> 05:48.079
A DUGAHNO NOVIDADE. THIS
THING'S WORTH A BUNDLE.

05:48.146 --> 05:49.847
REALLY?
OH, SURE.

05:49.915 --> 05:51.549
A MEMBER OF
MY WINE ENTHUSIASTS CLUB

05:51.617 --> 05:54.151
BOUGHT ONE
FOR OVER $1,200.

05:54.219 --> 05:56.020
OH, MY GOD!
YEAH.

05:56.088 --> 05:59.290
YOU SEE, THE REASON
IT'S SO RARE

05:59.358 --> 06:02.193
IS THAT YEAR THERE WAS AN EARLY
FROST, SO THE GRAPE HARVEST-

06:02.261 --> 06:05.463
MESSAGE RECEIVED,
STUBBY.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.632
WHY ARE YOU
SO BENT OUT OF SHAPE?

06:07.699 --> 06:08.716
DON'T YOU GET IT?

06:08.784 --> 06:11.219
I PROMISED TO GIVE THIS
TO DOUGLAS AND CARRIE.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.555
DAMN IT. WHY DIDN'T I JUST
MAKE THEM ANOTHER BIRDHOUSE?

06:21.046 --> 06:23.481
WEDDING VOW
RENEWAL, HUH?

06:23.548 --> 06:25.249
WHAT YOU PLAN
ON DOING,

06:25.317 --> 06:27.952
YOU KNOW,
BEST MAN-WISE?

06:28.019 --> 06:29.487
IS IT GONNA BE
DEACON AGAIN?

06:29.555 --> 06:31.038
BECAUSE AT YOUR WEDDING, YOU PICKED HIM

06:31.106 --> 06:33.223
AND, YOU KNOW,
NOT ME,

06:33.291 --> 06:34.525
AND NOT THAT
I REALLY CARED,

06:34.593 --> 06:38.129
BUT IT WAS... WEIRD.

06:38.196 --> 06:41.415
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M
NOT GOING WITH A BEST MAN.

06:41.483 --> 06:42.884
UH, HELLO!

06:42.951 --> 06:44.218
SOMEONE HAS TO HAND YOU
THE WEDDING RING.

06:44.285 --> 06:45.285
IT'S TRADITION.

06:45.353 --> 06:48.155
YEAH. I'M HAVING
A MONKEY DO THAT.

06:48.223 --> 06:49.757
WHAT?

06:49.824 --> 06:51.059
YEAH, I WAS GONNA GO
WITH A SPIDER MONKEY,

06:51.126 --> 06:53.928
AND THEN I DECIDED YOU
ONLY GET MARRIED AGAIN ONCE,

06:53.996 --> 06:55.763
SO I'M GOING
WITH A CHIMP.

06:55.830 --> 06:57.531
THAT'S YOUR CADILLAC
OF MONKEYS.

06:57.599 --> 06:58.866
WAIT A MINUTE HERE.
HOLD ON.

06:58.934 --> 07:01.502
I LOST OUT
ON BEING BEST MAN...

07:01.570 --> 07:03.053
TO A MONKEY?

07:03.121 --> 07:04.955
NOT BY MUCH.

07:05.023 --> 07:07.275
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

07:07.342 --> 07:08.193
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

07:08.260 --> 07:09.610
OH, OK, UH, WELL,

07:09.677 --> 07:10.911
MY WIFE AND I,
WE'RE RENEWING OUR VOWS,

07:10.979 --> 07:13.848
AND WE NEED TO RENT SOME
CHAIRS AND TABLES AND STUFF.

07:13.915 --> 07:15.416
HERE'S THE DATE,
THERE'S THE TIME.

07:15.484 --> 07:17.418
NOW, DO I NEED TO LEAVE
YOU A DEPOSIT OR YOU-

07:17.486 --> 07:18.636
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

07:18.704 --> 07:21.238
WHAT KIND OF CHAIRS
DID YOU WANT?

07:21.306 --> 07:23.157
UH...

07:23.225 --> 07:25.226
THE KIND YOU, UH,

07:30.549 --> 07:31.883
FLAT BACK, ARCHED,
FAUX BAMBOO.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.819
I'M OBLIGED TO ALSO
MENTION BEAN BAG CHAIRS,

07:34.887 --> 07:38.790
BUT I FORBID YOU. SIT DOWN
AND I'LL GO GET OUR CATALOG.

07:38.858 --> 07:39.974
OK.

07:43.312 --> 07:45.914
"THE BEASTIE BOY"?

07:45.981 --> 07:47.515
OH, THAT'S
MY MONKEY GUY.

07:49.084 --> 07:52.837
HELLO. HEY! SO WE'RE
GOOD TO GO ON THE 18th?

07:54.673 --> 07:56.473
WHAT?

07:56.541 --> 07:58.776
OHH. CAN'T
FLEISCHMAN TOYOTA

07:58.844 --> 08:01.378
HAVE THEIR "GOING
BANANAS" SALE WITHOUT HIM?

08:02.764 --> 08:05.166
OK, FINE. UM,
SO I GUESS WE'LL GO

08:05.233 --> 08:08.402
WITH THAT
SPIDER MONKEY.

08:08.470 --> 08:11.339
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.

08:11.406 --> 08:13.607
OK, THEN. THANKS.

08:13.675 --> 08:15.510
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
I CAN'T GET MY MONKEY.

08:15.577 --> 08:17.512
OH, CAN'T YOU?

08:17.579 --> 08:19.881
WELL, MAYBE
I'M NOT AVAILABLE NOW.

08:19.948 --> 08:20.982
ALL RIGHT.

08:21.049 --> 08:22.884
NO, NO, I'LL DO IT,
I'LL DO IT.

08:25.020 --> 08:30.057
YES, HI. I'M LOOKING FOR
MARIA FERRARO, THE FLUTIST.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.809
THIS IS SHE.
THE FLAUTIST.

08:31.877 --> 08:34.260
HEY, POTAY-TO,
POTAH-TO, RIGHT?

08:34.330 --> 08:36.597
IT'S FLAUTIST.

08:36.664 --> 08:39.099
RIGHT. ANYWAY, MY HUSBAND
AND I WERE THINKING

08:39.167 --> 08:41.402
ABOUT HIRING YOU
FOR OUR VOW RENEWAL,

08:41.470 --> 08:42.669
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF I COULD HEAR YOU

08:42.738 --> 08:44.104
PLAY
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

08:44.172 --> 08:46.440
WELL, THE PHONE ISN'T
REALLY THE BEST MEDIUM.

08:46.508 --> 08:50.111
EITHER FLAUT OR
GET OFF THE POT, OK?

08:54.282 --> 08:56.183
UH, HELLO? WOULD YOU
JUST HOLD ON

08:56.251 --> 08:58.019
FOR ONE SECOND, OK?

08:58.086 --> 09:00.954
HELLO? MISS?
YOO-HOO!

09:02.357 --> 09:05.159
BE RIGHT BACK.
HELLO.

09:05.227 --> 09:07.361
HI, DARLING.
I WAS JUST THINKING

09:07.429 --> 09:09.763
INSTEAD OF THAT
STODGY OLD PORT WINE,

09:09.831 --> 09:11.598
HOW ABOUT IF I FLOAT YOU
A DELIGHTFUL BOTTLE

09:11.666 --> 09:14.402
OF PEACH SCHNAPPS?
NEARLY FULL.

09:14.469 --> 09:17.038
WELL, DAD, I KIND OF
HAD MY HEART SET

09:17.105 --> 09:18.572
ON TRYING THE PORT.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.909
UH-HUH. WHAT ABOUT
IF I THROW IN A CANNED HAM?

09:23.278 --> 09:26.280
ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA GO. I'LL
TALK TO YOU LATER. HELLO?

09:26.348 --> 09:28.182
HEY, I NEED YOU
TO DECIDE ON A TABLE.

09:28.250 --> 09:30.451
THEY HAVE ROUND, OVAL,
SQUARE, RECTANGLE,

09:30.519 --> 09:31.985
ONE IN THAT
STOP-SIGN SHAPE-

09:32.054 --> 09:33.321
I'M ON THE OTHER LINE
RIGHT NOW, HONEY.

09:33.389 --> 09:34.972
LISTEN, I AM VERY CLOSE
TO BLACKING OUT.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.057
PLEASE PICK A SHAPE.

09:37.125 --> 09:38.610
I AM ON THE OTHER LINE
WITH THE FLUTE LADY.

09:38.677 --> 09:39.777
WAIT A SECOND.
NO, I GOTTA GO.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.779
I'LL TALK TO YOU
AT HOME. OK, BYE.

09:41.847 --> 09:44.916
THAT SOUNDED GREAT.

09:46.318 --> 09:50.254
HELLO?
YOU STILL THERE?

09:50.322 --> 09:52.857
WHERE ARE YOU?

09:52.925 --> 09:55.059
I THINK THE MORE
APPROPRIATE QUESTION

09:55.127 --> 09:57.862
IS WHERE WERE YOU?

09:57.930 --> 10:00.331
OH, UM, I'M SORRY.
SEE, WHAT HAPPENED WAS-

10:06.955 --> 10:08.922
UGH! THIS PARTY!

10:08.990 --> 10:10.558
ARE ALL FLAUTISTS
BITCHES?

10:10.625 --> 10:12.626
BECAUSE I KNOW
3 OF THEM ARE.

10:12.694 --> 10:15.229
AND THE BAKERY WON'T
DELIVER TO THE BLUFF,

10:15.297 --> 10:17.231
SO WE GOTTA
DRIVE 25 MILES

10:17.299 --> 10:20.101
WITH A 4-FOOT-HIGH CAKE
STRAPPED TO OUR HOOD.

10:20.168 --> 10:22.136
AND PORT-A-POTTIES
ARE A FORTUNE.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.904
CAN'T WE JUST TELL
EVERYBODY ON THE INVITATION

10:23.972 --> 10:27.174
TO COME HAVING PEED?

10:27.242 --> 10:28.875
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

10:28.943 --> 10:31.262
MR. BONGO'S A WHORE.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.613
WHAT?

10:32.680 --> 10:34.615
HE BLEW US OFF
BECAUSE HE GOT A JOB

10:34.683 --> 10:37.585
WORKING A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP
WITH PHIL SIMMS.

10:37.653 --> 10:39.720
OH, I'M SORRY, BABY.

10:42.056 --> 10:43.090
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT

10:43.158 --> 10:44.525
THAT A BEAUTIFUL THING
LIKE A VOW RENEWAL

10:44.593 --> 10:46.761
WOULD BE SUCH
A PAIN IN THE ASS?

10:46.828 --> 10:48.262
I KNOW.

10:48.330 --> 10:50.798
BUT YOU'RE STILL
INTO IT, RIGHT?

10:50.865 --> 10:52.333
YEAH.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.501
I MEAN, IF YOU ARE.

10:53.568 --> 10:56.403
NO, I AM.

10:56.471 --> 10:58.873
I'D BE WILLING NOT TO, THOUGH, IF YOU-

10:58.940 --> 10:59.623
OK.
REALLY?

10:59.691 --> 11:01.526
YEAH.
OH, MY GOD!

11:01.593 --> 11:05.179
I AM SO RELIEVED! WE ARE
KILLING OURSELVES HERE.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.897
YES!

11:06.965 --> 11:08.349
OH, I'M SO HAPPY
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS.

11:08.416 --> 11:09.683
WHAT WERE WE THINKING?

11:09.751 --> 11:10.818
I KNOW! I MEAN, WE ALREADY DID OUR VOWS.

11:10.886 --> 11:11.919
WE SAID THEM ONCE.

11:11.987 --> 11:13.421
THEY NEVER GO BAD.
THEY'RE LIKE TWINKIES.

11:13.489 --> 11:14.755
RIGHT!

11:14.823 --> 11:15.706
HEY, KIDS,
DON'T MIND ME.

11:15.774 --> 11:17.425
JUST DROPPING OFF
SOME LITERATURE.

11:17.492 --> 11:19.493
APPARENTLY, THEY FOUND
A LINK BETWEEN PORT WINE

11:19.561 --> 11:22.096
AND IRRITABLE
BOWEL SYNDROME.

11:22.164 --> 11:23.564
OH, THAT'S OK, DAD.

11:23.631 --> 11:25.466
WE DECIDED NOT
TO RENEW OUR VOWS.

11:25.533 --> 11:29.036
OH, WELL,
THAT'S TOO BAD.

11:29.104 --> 11:31.189
HOT DOG!

11:34.776 --> 11:36.177
HELLO.

11:36.244 --> 11:38.312
DOUGIE, IT'S MOM. HEY, MA.

11:38.379 --> 11:40.498
I JUST WANTED YOU TO
KNOW SMITTY IS DIABETIC

11:40.565 --> 11:41.665
AND IS WONDERING
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

11:41.733 --> 11:44.034
SPLENDA PACKETS
ON THE TABLE.

11:44.102 --> 11:46.487
OH, WELL,
YOU CAN TELL HIM...

11:46.555 --> 11:48.121
OR HER NOT TO WORRY

11:48.190 --> 11:49.923
BECAUSE WE'RE CALLING
THE WHOLE THING OFF.

11:49.991 --> 11:51.225
WHAT?

11:51.293 --> 11:52.009
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:52.077 --> 11:53.060
IT JUST TURNED
INTO A HUGE PAIN,

11:53.128 --> 11:54.995
AND WE JUST
DECIDED TO BAG IT.

11:55.063 --> 11:57.832
OH. I SEE.

12:00.035 --> 12:02.736
WELL, I'LL TELL SMITTY,
AND, UH,

12:02.804 --> 12:05.039
THAT'S THAT, THEN.

12:05.106 --> 12:06.507
OK, MA,
THEN SAY HI TO DAD,

12:06.574 --> 12:07.708
AND I'LL TALK
TO YOU SOON.

12:07.775 --> 12:09.810
GOOD-BYE, SWEETHEART. BYE.

12:09.878 --> 12:12.813
JOE! THE KIDS
ARE IN TROUBLE!

12:17.252 --> 12:19.036
HEY, CARRIE.

12:19.104 --> 12:21.672
I NEED YOU TO 3-HOLE-PUNCH
THIS SET OF PAPERS,

12:21.740 --> 12:23.341
AND 2-HOLE-PUNCH
THIS SET,

12:23.408 --> 12:25.843
AND REMEMBER TO SAVE
THOSE LITTLE CIRCLES-

12:25.910 --> 12:27.611
FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE
CONFETTI. I KNOW.

12:27.679 --> 12:28.746
OK. YOU'RE THE BEST.

12:28.813 --> 12:30.080
MM-HMM.

12:30.149 --> 12:33.351
OH, BY THE WAY, I'M COMING
SOLO TO YOUR VOW RENEWAL.

12:33.418 --> 12:34.484
I FIGURE
ROMANTIC SETTING,

12:34.552 --> 12:36.253
WHY BRING
AN OLD COW ALONG

12:36.321 --> 12:39.523
WHEN THERE ARE NEW CALVES
FOR THE LASSOING?

12:39.590 --> 12:42.659
YOU DIDN'T HEAR? WE
CANCELED THE WHOLE THING.

12:42.727 --> 12:45.246
OH. SORRY.
THAT'S TOO BAD.

12:45.313 --> 12:48.515
OH, NO, NO. IT'S OK.
IT JUST BECAME A HASSLE.

12:48.583 --> 12:51.201
A HASSLE. MM-HMM.

12:52.737 --> 12:53.971
YOU KNOW, CARRIE,

12:54.039 --> 12:57.475
WE HAVE A POLICY FOR
WHAT WE CALL CRISIS LEAVE.

12:57.543 --> 12:58.909
YEAH, NO, I KNOW.

12:58.977 --> 13:02.780
I REMEMBER FROM
WHEN YOU TOOK YOURS.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.248
BUT, NO, WE'RE FINE.
DOUG AND I ARE GREAT.

13:04.316 --> 13:06.116
WE'VE NEVER
BEEN BETTER.

13:06.184 --> 13:08.168
RIGHT.

13:15.777 --> 13:19.297
HEY, KIDDO. I JUST HEARD
YOU CALLED THINGS OFF.

13:19.364 --> 13:21.098
YOU OK?

13:25.704 --> 13:26.870
YEAH?

13:28.639 --> 13:30.241
TALK TO ME, GUY.

13:30.308 --> 13:31.608
EXCUSE ME?

13:31.676 --> 13:32.726
TALK TO ME.

13:32.794 --> 13:34.027
ABOUT WHAT?

13:34.096 --> 13:37.064
TALK... TO... ME.

13:37.132 --> 13:38.799
HEY!

13:38.866 --> 13:41.652
LOOK, I HEARD YOU
WERE CANCELING YOUR VOWS.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.888
I
- I HAD NO IDEA THINGS WERE THIS BAD WITH YOU TWO.

13:44.956 --> 13:46.240
IT'S NOT BAD. WHAT
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:46.308 --> 13:48.075
IT JUST BECAME A BIG
PAIN, THAT'S ALL.

13:48.143 --> 13:50.761
HEY, WHEN I ACCEPTED

13:50.829 --> 13:52.830
YOUR INVITATION
TO BE YOUR BEST MAN,

13:52.897 --> 13:55.966
I DIDN'T JUST SIGN UP
FOR THE GOOD TIMES.

13:56.034 --> 13:58.102
I CONSIDER IT
A RESPONSIBILITY,

13:58.169 --> 14:00.938
AND I TAKE IT
VERY SERIOUSLY.

14:01.005 --> 14:02.623
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE A MONKEY.

14:02.691 --> 14:04.724
SHH!

14:04.792 --> 14:06.410
EASY.

14:06.477 --> 14:08.512
IT'S ME HERE.

14:08.580 --> 14:11.766
TAKE OFF THE MASK.

14:11.833 --> 14:14.352
Let me see your face.

14:14.419 --> 14:15.770
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT, MAN.

14:15.837 --> 14:17.672
WE SHOULD TALK,
BUT, UH,

14:17.739 --> 14:18.906
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
THESE WALLS HAVE EARS,

14:18.973 --> 14:19.973
SO LET'S GO OUTSIDE
AND DO IT OUT THERE.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.041
OH, GOOD CALL, BUDDY.

14:21.109 --> 14:22.042
YEAH, TOTALLY.

14:22.110 --> 14:24.278
AHEM. OK.

14:29.867 --> 14:31.468
SO HAS ANYBODY
BOUGHT MY PORT?

14:31.536 --> 14:32.869
WE DON'T KNOW
YET, OK?

14:32.938 --> 14:33.938
THIS IS
AN ON-LINE AUCTION.

14:34.005 --> 14:35.739
IT COULD GO ON
FOR DAYS.

14:35.807 --> 14:37.692
WELL, I CAN'T
SIT HERE FOR DAYS.

14:37.759 --> 14:39.676
I MEAN, THE NEXT 2
ARE FINE, BUT ON THURSDAY,

14:39.745 --> 14:41.979
I'M SAMPLING FOOD
AT COSTCO WITH MICKEY.

14:43.798 --> 14:47.034
THE CURRENT BID
IS...

14:47.102 --> 14:49.870
$1,350!

14:49.937 --> 14:51.705
<i>MAMALOSHEN!</i>

14:53.925 --> 14:57.544
OHH. HEY, GUYS. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ON MY COMPUTER?

14:57.612 --> 14:59.145
OH, JUST, UH...

14:59.213 --> 15:02.199
LOOKING AT PORNOGRAPHY,
SWEETHEART.

15:02.267 --> 15:04.168
WELL, GOOD LUCK
WITH THAT.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.970
THANK YOU.

15:07.171 --> 15:11.108
SUPERMARKET
KNOCKOFF ADVIL NOW!

15:11.175 --> 15:12.442
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU?

15:12.510 --> 15:13.978
OH, WORK WAS CRAZY.

15:14.045 --> 15:15.846
I MEAN, EVER SINCE WE
CANCELED RENEWING OUR VOWS,

15:15.914 --> 15:17.581
EVERYONE THINKS OUR
MARRIAGE IS IN TROUBLE.

15:17.649 --> 15:19.633
THEY WERE ALL LIKE,
"ARE YOU OK?

15:19.785 --> 15:21.185
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU,
SWEETIE."

15:21.253 --> 15:23.921
IT'S SO
FREAKIN' ANNOYING.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.957
I GOT THE SAME THING
FROM DANNY,

15:26.024 --> 15:29.293
AND THE CHAIR GUY
INVITED ME OUT FOR SUSHI.

15:31.412 --> 15:33.463
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET THE MACHINE GET IT.

15:33.531 --> 15:35.933
IT'S PROBABLY JUST DANNY
REMINDING ME HUGS ARE FREE.

15:37.735 --> 15:39.736
DOUGIE,
IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

15:39.805 --> 15:43.023
I'M GONNA TRY AND
SAY THIS WITHOUT CRYING.

15:43.091 --> 15:46.944
EVERY MARRIAGE
HAS ITS POTHOLES...

15:47.012 --> 15:50.698
OH, GOD.
IT'S SPREAD TO FLORIDA.

15:50.765 --> 15:54.468
AND MARRIAGE CAN BE A LONG
AND WONDERFUL WINDING ROAD.

15:54.535 --> 15:55.335
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:55.403 --> 15:56.487
SHOULD WE JUST
GO THROUGH WITH THIS

15:56.555 --> 15:58.722
TO STOP
THIS MADNESS?

15:58.790 --> 15:59.389
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT

15:59.457 --> 16:01.375
JUST TO PROVE
SOMETHING TO PEOPLE.

16:01.443 --> 16:03.760
DOUG, I CAN'T LIVE
LIKE THIS ANYMORE!

16:03.828 --> 16:05.579
AND WHEN TROUBLE
COMES INTO THAT HOME-

16:05.647 --> 16:07.882
OH, FOR THE LOVE OF PETE!
WILL YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE?

16:07.949 --> 16:09.850
GO BACK
TO YOUR PROGRAM, JOE!

16:09.918 --> 16:12.853
THIS IS A PRIVATE
CONVERSATION.

16:12.921 --> 16:15.872
WHEN YOU HAVE TROUBLE,

16:15.940 --> 16:18.208
ALL YOU NEED TO GET THROUGH
IT IS FAITH IN EACH OTHER

16:18.276 --> 16:19.477
AND IN GOD.

16:19.544 --> 16:22.513
OH, GREAT. NOW SHE'S GOT
GOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

16:22.581 --> 16:25.165
THAT'S
A LOT OF FIREPOWER.

16:25.232 --> 16:27.518
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL DO IT!

16:27.586 --> 16:30.353
MA, MA, YEAH.
DON'T WORRY.

16:30.421 --> 16:33.557
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE
GONNA RENEW THE VOWS.

16:33.624 --> 16:35.592
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HAPPY.

16:35.660 --> 16:39.046
OK. BYE.

16:39.114 --> 16:41.498
THAT'S A KICK
IN THE OBLONGS.

16:44.853 --> 16:47.304
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF
THE LOVE THAT YOU TWO SHARE

16:47.372 --> 16:49.189
THAT YOU'VE CHOSEN
TO COME TOGETHER

16:49.257 --> 16:52.626
AT THIS BLESSED RENEWAL
OF YOUR WEDDING VOWS.

16:57.065 --> 16:58.749
AM I CORRECT?

16:58.817 --> 16:59.900
HMM?

16:59.967 --> 17:02.936
OH. YEAH, YEAH. BEAUTIFUL
THING, BEAUTIFUL.

17:03.004 --> 17:06.673
WELL, NOW, ARE YOU PLANNING
ON WRITING YOUR OWN VOWS?

17:06.741 --> 17:08.191
GOTTA BE HONEST
WITH YOU, FATHER.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.462
WHATEVER YOU
GOT HANDY IS FINE.

17:11.529 --> 17:12.896
YEAH, WE'LL JUST
TAKE THE STANDARD VOWS,

17:12.964 --> 17:16.165
<i>AND WE'LL FILL IN ALL THE
PERSONAL STUFF, LIKE MAD LIBS.</i>

17:17.351 --> 17:19.486
UH, DOUG, UH, CARRIE,

17:19.554 --> 17:22.656
YOU DO REALIZE
THIS IS A VOW RENEWAL.

17:22.723 --> 17:24.858
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

17:24.925 --> 17:26.527
OH, NO, NO, NO,
WE HAVE TO DO THIS.

17:26.594 --> 17:28.829
YEAH, BECAUSE EVERYONE
WE KNOW IS ALL OVER US

17:28.896 --> 17:31.164
BECAUSE
OF HER GREAT IDEA.

17:31.232 --> 17:32.900
WHOA, WHOA!

17:32.967 --> 17:35.368
YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO
BLAME ME FOR THIS, ARE YOU?

17:35.436 --> 17:36.520
ALL I'M SAYING IS IF
YOU HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT,

17:36.588 --> 17:38.489
MY MOM WOULDN'T BE CRYING
INTO OUR ANSWERING MACHINE.

17:38.556 --> 17:39.657
OH, PLEASE,
WOULD YOU?

17:39.724 --> 17:40.974
I'M GONNA GO GET

17:41.042 --> 17:43.927
<i>THE AFFIRMATION
OF LOVE PAMPHLET.</i>

17:43.995 --> 17:46.230
FIRST OF ALL, THE ONLY
REASON WHY I THOUGHT OF IT

17:46.298 --> 17:49.216
IN THE FIRST PLACE IS BECAUSE
YOU WERE GOING ON AND ON

17:49.284 --> 17:52.486
ABOUT HOW MUCH "IN LOVE" YOU
WERE WITH ME AT THE RESTAURANT.

17:52.554 --> 17:54.138
AND THE ONLY REASON I
WAS SAYING I WAS "IN LOVE"

17:54.205 --> 17:55.705
WITH YOU IS BECAUSE
YOU GOT ME DRUNK

17:55.773 --> 17:57.741
AND PROMISED ME
A MONKEY.

17:57.808 --> 18:01.078
OH, YEAH, DOUG, AND THAT
WAS A BRILLIANT IDEA-

18:01.146 --> 18:02.946
TAKE OUR SACRED
WEDDING VOWS

18:03.014 --> 18:04.882
AND TURN IT INTO
A FRIGGIN' CIRCUS!

18:04.949 --> 18:06.817
I KNEW IT. YOU'VE
ALWAYS HATED MY MONKEY!

18:06.884 --> 18:08.068
FROM THE BEGINNING!

18:08.136 --> 18:09.886
YA THINK?

18:09.954 --> 18:12.055
DOUG, CARRIE.

18:12.123 --> 18:16.860
I HAVE A YOUNG, HAPPY COUPLE
WAITING RIGHT OUTSIDE.

18:16.928 --> 18:17.811
OH, SORRY, FATHER.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.797
WE'LL-WE'LL LOWER OUR VOICES. YEAH.

18:19.865 --> 18:23.266
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU GUYS
COULD, UH, JUST...

18:36.298 --> 18:38.048
SHE'S
45 MINUTES LATE.

18:38.116 --> 18:39.449
I DON'T THINK
SHE'S COMING.

18:39.517 --> 18:40.884
THE GIRL'S
JUST A LITTLE LATE.

18:40.952 --> 18:43.386
SCATTERBRAINED
IS ALL SHE IS.

18:43.454 --> 18:46.356
I'M NOT SO SURE.
PRAY WITH ME, JOE.

18:46.424 --> 18:48.458
SHE'LL BE HERE!

18:48.526 --> 18:52.096
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!

18:52.163 --> 18:53.030
POOR KID.

18:53.097 --> 18:54.565
YOU KNOW, I SAW THE WHOLE THING COMING.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.768
EVERYONE DID.
SHE'S BEEN SO STRESSED.

18:57.836 --> 18:59.537
I HEARD HER
YELL AT A FLAUTIST.

18:59.604 --> 19:02.072
YOWCH.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.457
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

19:03.524 --> 19:05.342
YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?
YOU NEED ANYTHING?

19:05.409 --> 19:06.677
HEY, STEP OFF, PAL.

19:06.745 --> 19:09.913
I'M THE BEST MAN.
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

19:09.981 --> 19:12.132
I WAS JUST GONNA ASK IF
HE WANTED ANOTHER SODA.

19:12.199 --> 19:14.167
YEAH, WELL, NOW I'M GONNA ASK
HIM IF HE WANTS ANOTHER SODA.

19:14.235 --> 19:15.301
YOU WANT ANOTHER SODA?
NO.

19:15.369 --> 19:16.903
NO. HE SAID NO. ALL RIGHT.
TAKE A STROLL, BABE.

19:16.971 --> 19:18.238
BYE-BYE!

19:20.057 --> 19:23.110
WELL, FOLKS, LOOKS LIKE DOUGLAS
HAS BEEN LEFT AT THE ALTAR.

19:23.177 --> 19:26.213
LET'S FORM AN ORDERLY LINE
AND WALK AWAY FROM THE BLUFF,

19:26.281 --> 19:27.614
AND ANY GIFTS
YOU MAY HAVE BROUGHT

19:27.682 --> 19:30.884
ARE OBVIOUSLY
YOURS TO KEEP.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.752
HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! I
HAVEN'T BEEN LEFT AT THE ALTAR!

19:32.820 --> 19:35.622
OK? CARRIE
WILL BE HERE.

19:35.690 --> 19:38.058
OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS FINE!

19:38.126 --> 19:39.326
IT'S GREAT!

19:40.928 --> 19:43.097
ALL RIGHT,
LOOK, IT'S NOT GREAT.

19:43.164 --> 19:45.366
OK, WE'RE IN A HUGE FIGHT
RIGHT NOW,

19:45.433 --> 19:48.135
AND I'M SURE
THAT'S WHY SHE'S LATE.

19:48.203 --> 19:49.370
BUT THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE IN A BIG FIGHT

19:49.437 --> 19:50.770
IS BECAUSE OF ALL OF YOU!

19:50.838 --> 19:53.307
THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU, MOM, AND DAD

19:53.375 --> 19:55.175
AND DANNY AND SMITTY

19:55.242 --> 19:57.327
OR JULES,
WHICHEVER ONE YOU ARE,

19:57.395 --> 19:59.312
AND GIRL
FROM CARRIE'S OFFICE

19:59.380 --> 20:00.997
WHOSE NAME I JUST
DON'T REMEMBER RIGHT NOW.

20:01.066 --> 20:02.699
AMY.
YEAH, AMY! WOW!

20:02.767 --> 20:05.402
I WAS THINKING DARLA.
I WAS WAY OFF.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.354
BUT THE POINT IS, THIS
IS ALL YOUR FAULT, OK?

20:07.422 --> 20:09.739
SO DON'T JUDGE US. WE
DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS.

20:09.807 --> 20:11.675
WE'RE JUST DOING THIS
FOR YOU.

20:11.742 --> 20:13.911
JOE, LOOK!

20:18.249 --> 20:20.333
OH, DAMN IT.

20:32.146 --> 20:33.279
SORRY I'M LATE.

20:33.348 --> 20:36.015
I HAD TO MAKE A PIT STOP
AT FLEISCHMAN TOYOTA.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.184
YOU BROUGHT MY MONKEY.

20:38.252 --> 20:40.404
HERE'S THE RING.

20:40.472 --> 20:44.274
AND, UH, HERE'S
A TOAST I WROTE.

20:47.762 --> 20:51.098
LISTEN, DOUG, I HEARD EVERYTHING
YOU WERE SAYING TO EVERYONE,

20:51.166 --> 20:52.265
AND I WANT TO TELL YOU

20:52.333 --> 20:54.802
THAT I'M NOT DOING THIS
FOR ANY OF THEM.

20:54.869 --> 20:56.970
I'M DOING THIS FOR US,

20:57.038 --> 20:58.756
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU

20:58.823 --> 21:01.425
VERY MUCH.

21:01.492 --> 21:03.760
NOW TAKE THE MONKEY,
'CAUSE HE SMELLS.

21:07.431 --> 21:09.332
FRIENDS, RELATIVES,

21:09.400 --> 21:12.536
WE ARE GATHERED
HERE TODAY

21:12.603 --> 21:16.040
FOR THE BLESSED RENEWAL
OF THE WEDDING VOWS

21:16.107 --> 21:18.842
OF DOUG AND CARRIE.

21:31.439 --> 21:33.373
SON OF A BITCH.

21:34.305 --> 21:40.802
