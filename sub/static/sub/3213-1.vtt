NARRATOR:
At the time this picture
was taken, not one of these

00:20.354 --> 00:22.190
fourth graders had ever
been married or engaged

00:22.223 --> 00:24.225
or in any kind
of long-term relationship.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.759
But as they grew
into adulthood,

00:25.793 --> 00:28.229
all of them found love
and paired off.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.598
All of them except one.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.666
In a world of happy couples,
there are those

00:32.700 --> 00:34.502
who just can't seem
to figure it out.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.004
They're often intelligent,
attractive, decent people,

00:37.037 --> 00:39.540
but still they remain alone.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.741
Why?

00:40.774 --> 00:42.843
Why does love elude them now

00:42.876 --> 00:45.479
and perhaps forever?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.249
CARYN:
How did this happen,

00:48.282 --> 00:49.417
Marty?

00:49.450 --> 00:51.419
I mean, wow, we had it.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.621
That amazing, magical connection

00:53.654 --> 00:56.124
that some people wait
their whole lives for, but...

00:56.157 --> 00:58.726
You, you were always
terrified of the intimacy.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.394
Weren't you?

01:00.428 --> 01:03.597
I could see it in your eyes
the very first day we met.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.033
Which was Wednesday.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.768
I tried to make you feel safe.
I really did.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.371
I tried on Wednesday,
I tried yesterday,

01:10.404 --> 01:12.773
and I would've tried today,
but you went off to play

01:12.806 --> 01:14.642
in that volleyball game,
which I later found out

01:14.675 --> 01:16.544
actually was coed-- whatever.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.312
(chuckles):
What are you even talking about?

01:18.346 --> 01:20.481
We got wasted
and humped in a lifeboat.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.316
Twice, Marty.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.352
We can build on that.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.620
Are you open
to couples counseling?

01:26.654 --> 01:29.990
Check, please.
I was gonna order dessert.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.295
What's up, chief?
Got some bad news, Stosh.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.496
We're letting you go.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.398
(chuckles)

01:37.431 --> 01:39.099
You're jerking my chain, right?

01:39.133 --> 01:40.934
No. It was Donald's decision.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.236
He asked me to tell you.

01:42.270 --> 01:45.173
Well, what was
Donald's reason, huh?

01:45.206 --> 01:46.907
Well, come on, Adam,
this is a load of crap.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.577
I-I've been the top
sales rep here nine years.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.445
Nine years.
What was his reason?

01:51.479 --> 01:52.513
He says you banged his fiancée.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.515
(laughs):
That is...

01:54.548 --> 01:56.284
that is possible.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.518
But come on, man.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.587
It takes two to tango.
Am I right?

01:59.620 --> 02:02.256
I mean, is it my fault
that she's a wild woman?

02:02.290 --> 02:04.158
Did I get her
that hit of ecstasy?

02:04.192 --> 02:06.527
He says you did, yes.
Hey, she asked me to.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.929
I can show you all the texts
back and forth.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.030
It's over, Stosh.

02:10.063 --> 02:11.665
What is your problem
anyway, huh?

02:11.699 --> 02:13.133
At your age, still living
the way you do.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.768
You some kind of sex addict
or something?

02:14.802 --> 02:16.970
Hey, I got the same sex drive
as everybody else.

02:17.004 --> 02:20.007
I just don't have the drive
to do all that other horse...

02:20.040 --> 02:21.975
Clean out your office.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.347
You know what?

02:28.416 --> 02:29.717
Zara?

02:29.750 --> 02:31.685
Going out, hon?
Yes.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.120
To get breakfast.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.121
When do you think
you'll be back?

02:34.154 --> 02:37.458
Um, probably... never-ish.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.692
Wait.

02:38.726 --> 02:40.194
Y-You're moving out?

02:40.228 --> 02:42.963
You were just gonna vanish
without saying a word?

02:42.996 --> 02:45.833
No. There's a muffin basket
coming later.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.335
I thought things were
so good between us.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.170
I know you did, David.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.072
Look, like everything
in this universe,

02:52.105 --> 02:54.675
love has its own
natural lifespan.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.345
And then,
in one heartbreaking moment,

02:57.378 --> 02:59.347
it's gone.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.215
And this is that moment?

03:01.249 --> 03:02.683
What, right now? Oh, God, no.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.585
It was, like,
in April or something

03:04.618 --> 03:07.588
when you tattooed
my name on your arm.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.756
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

03:08.789 --> 03:09.857
This is mine.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.259
What kind of
person could be

03:11.292 --> 03:12.493
so passionate and loving one day

03:12.526 --> 03:14.161
and then just go
completely cold?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.397
What kind of
person is that?

03:20.734 --> 03:22.870
TV ANNOUNCER:
Two down, bottom of the ninth...

03:22.903 --> 03:24.538
He won't give him
nothing to hit.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.840
He should be smart
and take the bases on balls.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.343
Pop, you are totally
and amazingly wrong.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.911
He should wait for the curve.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.446
Mom would've agreed with me.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.348
Yeah, she would've
been wrong, too.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.183
Take the bases on...

03:36.216 --> 03:37.718
Here's the 3-2 pitch.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.587
Swinging,
fouled off back this way.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.389
Oh, you see that? He was...

03:41.422 --> 03:43.257
Right after the game tonight,
the Mets will head

03:43.291 --> 03:45.125
to the airport
for a three-city road trip--

03:45.158 --> 03:46.394
St. Louis, Colorado and Atlanta.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.795
Pop?

03:47.828 --> 03:50.298
And they'll finish
that off next weekend.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.099
Oh...

03:52.132 --> 03:53.200
No, no, no, no. Pop.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.802
Here is the 3-2 pitch on the...

03:54.835 --> 03:57.137
Swinging!
(bat cracks, crowd cheering)

04:02.075 --> 04:03.977
CARYN: Hey, Mom.
Cruise ship just got in.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.546
EVELYN:
Oh, welcome home, darling.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.714
So, did you meet anyone?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.949
I met a great guy the first day,

04:08.982 --> 04:11.585
but he didn't like me
as much as I liked him.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.954
And... neither did
the two after that.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.924
Oy. What are you doing
on a singles cruise anyway?

04:16.957 --> 04:19.993
Howard is such a wonderful man
and a doctor.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.662
Why don't you just
accept his proposal

04:21.695 --> 04:22.896
and be done with this nonsense?

04:22.930 --> 04:23.931
No.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.399
You do not select well, Caryn.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.601
Always the bad boys
with the swagger

04:27.635 --> 04:29.737
and the tight blue jeans.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.305
You know what I think?

04:31.339 --> 04:34.475
I think that's
what gets you... excited.

04:34.508 --> 04:35.743
Duh.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.311
Grow up already
and marry Howard!

04:37.345 --> 04:39.513
And I know you're playing
a game on your phone.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.756
That vindictive ass bag.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.658
(groans)

04:50.691 --> 04:51.959
Sorry to impose, Sue.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.260
But, hell, a man's got a right

04:53.293 --> 04:54.895
to get into his own home,
doesn't he?

04:56.063 --> 04:57.765
You know, those bastards
can take away

04:57.798 --> 04:59.299
their company-owned condo.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.336
They can't take away my dignity.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.871
Or my watches.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.173
Or my Italian suits.
Oh, boy.

05:06.206 --> 05:10.143
Or my salon-grade
microdermabrasion kit.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.045
(huffs)
All right.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.347
Aren't you gonna wish me luck?

05:13.381 --> 05:15.282
Just jump.
All right, then.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.450
See you.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.685
(grunts)

05:17.718 --> 05:20.053
Oh, right in
the gonads!

05:20.087 --> 05:21.522
(groaning)

05:21.555 --> 05:23.624
Mother of ass!

05:23.657 --> 05:25.393
Are we done here or...?

05:25.426 --> 05:28.328
You got time for a quick drink?

05:37.905 --> 05:40.874
(harmonica playing)

05:46.514 --> 05:48.215
Oh, you need some help?

05:48.248 --> 05:50.350
Uh, no, thanks.
I got it.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.185
I live here.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.353
In this one.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.822
Yeah, you're sock puppet guy.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.356
(laughs):
Yeah.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.659
Yeah, I do puppet shows
on the steps sometimes.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.860
For the kids.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.495
I've never seen any kids.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.564
My father died.

06:03.597 --> 06:04.832
What?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.066
(louder):
My father died.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.702
I heard you. I'm just, um...

06:08.736 --> 06:11.038
I'm sorry.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.707
He was a good guy.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.509
Mm...

06:15.543 --> 06:17.945
(harmonica playing)

06:23.717 --> 06:26.253
Molly?

06:26.286 --> 06:27.555
Molly, are you home?

06:28.422 --> 06:30.057
(screaming)

06:30.090 --> 06:31.358
Ew! Who are you?

06:31.391 --> 06:32.960
Um, I came to the
party last night,

06:32.993 --> 06:34.928
and I wound up having sex
with your daughter.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.698
Oh, Caryn, hi!
How was the cruise?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.199
Oh, Logan, this is

06:39.232 --> 06:40.968
my roommate/landlady Caryn.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.470
Oh, nice to meet you, man.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.337
All right.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.106
Isn't he great?

06:46.139 --> 06:47.475
Is he wearing my underwear?

06:47.508 --> 06:48.976
Mine were too small.
I'm gonna go shower.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.679
And then I'll totally
help you clean up.

06:53.346 --> 06:54.915
Hey, lady?
(gasps)

06:54.948 --> 06:56.249
You seen my twin brother?

06:57.518 --> 06:58.819
Thanks.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.654
(door opens, closes)

07:00.688 --> 07:03.156
This has to stop being my life.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.739
(sighs)
Send.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.242
No emoticons,
no emoticons, no emoticons.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.444
(phone whooshes)

07:27.681 --> 07:30.651
(gas hissing)

07:30.684 --> 07:33.854
(inhales deeply)

07:38.892 --> 07:42.863
We have gathered here today
to pay our final respects

07:42.896 --> 07:44.998
to Melvin...

07:45.032 --> 07:47.200
Le-window.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.636
(whispers):
Lewandoski.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.470
Lavan-dusty.

07:50.504 --> 07:54.642
Melvin was born in 1935

07:54.675 --> 07:57.377
in the small Polish town

07:57.410 --> 08:00.113
of Cha... Cha...

08:00.147 --> 08:01.381
Czestochowa.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.651
Cheska-wawa.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.052
Psst! Eric?

08:05.085 --> 08:06.854
In 1963...
(whispers): Hey! Cousin Stosh!

08:06.887 --> 08:07.888
Yeah.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.657
It's been a long time.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.991
How you doing?

08:11.024 --> 08:12.492
Great! Oh.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.828
Except I got
some bad news for you.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.496
My dad died.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.832
Yeah, man.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.634
I know. I read it
in the obits. I mean...

08:20.668 --> 08:22.335
(shushes)
Wait. You got to hear this.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.637
...welcome into
the world

08:23.671 --> 08:26.707
their one and only child,
Eric...

08:26.740 --> 08:28.075
Lavan-dusty.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.510
That's me.

08:30.544 --> 08:33.313
ERIC:
So, then after high school,

08:33.346 --> 08:35.415
I got a job working nights
on the bridge,

08:35.448 --> 08:38.218
and kept living here so I could
take care of Ma and Pop.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.853
Did that for about three years.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.421
And then...

08:41.454 --> 08:44.091
and then I just kept doing it.

08:44.124 --> 08:47.094
So is the place kind of
how you remember it?

08:47.127 --> 08:49.597
Hasn't changed since '89.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.932
Literally not one thing.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.668
You know,
I missed you, Cousin Stosh.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.770
Yeah? You miss having

08:56.804 --> 09:00.007
some stupid douche bag
put slush balls down your back?

09:00.040 --> 09:02.042
I mean, not just
any stupid douche bag.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.711
It was you. (chuckles)

09:04.544 --> 09:06.213
Hey, listen, Eric.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.849
If you need some help with
the transition and whatnot,

09:08.882 --> 09:11.585
I'd be happy to move out
of my place in the city

09:11.619 --> 09:14.121
and come stay here for
a while, if you like.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.890
That would be... awesome!

09:16.924 --> 09:18.525
Yeah?
Yeah!

09:18.558 --> 09:20.260
All right, thanks! Thank...
I mean, good, good.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.295
This is good. You know what?
I'm gonna go get my stuff.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.364
But here's what I want
you to do for me.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.699
I want you to get outside.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.134
Get in the sunshine and try

09:27.167 --> 09:29.402
to enjoy your life
for a change, huh?

09:29.436 --> 09:31.038
Enjoy my life.
Yeah.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.140
I'm gonna give that a shot.
All right.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.108
Do me a favor-- get some
new stuff for the walls,

09:35.142 --> 09:37.477
'cause if I have to sleep here
with your picture everywhere,

09:37.510 --> 09:39.479
I'll never choke
the sheriff again.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.649
(laughing)

09:41.682 --> 09:43.817
First day of your
new life. Go!
Okay.

09:43.851 --> 09:46.754
You're totally gonna
choke the sheriff here!

09:46.787 --> 09:49.990
ERIC:
Hi. Hi.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.959
Hello.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.126
Hi.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.362
Hey.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.837
Ma'am, um, my cousin,

10:03.871 --> 10:05.305
he told me to buy some art.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.007
So what would be
good art to buy?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.176
It's, like, for, like, a wall.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.610
(chuckles)

10:10.644 --> 10:13.280
Uh, well, uh, maybe
if there's a piece

10:13.313 --> 10:15.248
that you find disturbing.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.850
Hmm.
One that
makes you experience

10:16.884 --> 10:20.353
an emotion that you're
deeply uncomfortable with.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.756
I'll take this one.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.357
(laughs)

10:25.225 --> 10:26.660
Uh...

10:26.694 --> 10:28.328
Uh, those paintings
aren't mine, actually.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.997
These are.

10:30.030 --> 10:33.300
Oh! Oh, okay. Ooh.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.102
I'll take this one
then definitely.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.104
Yeah, it's a lot better
than that weird kitten.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.138
(laughs)

10:38.171 --> 10:40.640
Shoot.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.609
Is it more than $16?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.611
It's $16 exactly.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.545
What?!

10:45.578 --> 10:47.347
Okay, great!

10:47.380 --> 10:49.116
Uh, here you go.
It's all singles.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.383
Thanks, man.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.619
Cool. It's humongous.
(laughs)

10:52.652 --> 10:54.822
So I-I just hang it up
on my wall?
Yup.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.124
(both laugh)

10:57.157 --> 10:58.291
Oh, whoa!

10:58.325 --> 10:59.659
Breezy!

10:59.693 --> 11:01.294
Hey, how far do you
have to walk with that?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.130
Uh, just across the bridge
to Queens.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.898
Oh.
I'll be okay.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.936
(grunts)
ZARA: Oh.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.446
Okay, whisk two eggs.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.250
Do not overcook pasta.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.322
Okay.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.824
Okay, just chop things.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.692
If you chop things,
you are cooking.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.062
All right, all my stuff
is in the truck.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.363
Caryn, I think it's mad cool

11:36.396 --> 11:37.831
that you're finally
getting married.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.900
Yes, I am! Thank you, Molly.

11:39.933 --> 11:43.036
Okay, bye!

11:43.070 --> 11:45.638
Bye.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.612
Wow.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.281
Nice first day.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.582
Hey!

11:55.615 --> 11:57.117
(smoke alarm beeping
in distance)

11:57.150 --> 11:59.052
CARYN (faintly):
Damn it! Ow!

12:07.127 --> 12:08.295
(groans)
Now what?

12:08.328 --> 12:09.429
(smoke alarm beeping)

12:09.462 --> 12:12.132
Hi.
Hi.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.301
Who are you?
I'm staying
with my cousin next door.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.136
You know him--
husky, sort of weird...

12:16.169 --> 12:18.438
Sweet, a little odd.
...kind of stupid, yeah.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.207
Anyway, is your
apartment on fire?

12:20.240 --> 12:21.741
No.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.310
Maybe.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.512
Let's have a look.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.916
Come on in.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.318
Holy hell,
what happened in here?

12:31.351 --> 12:33.720
I was trying to cook
dinner for my fiancé.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.655
Fiancé. Fiancé.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.090
Wow, that is one of those words

12:37.124 --> 12:39.392
that sounds strange
if you say it a lot.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.661
(smoke alarm stops)
Or even once.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.469
So, you need help
salvaging the meal?

12:49.502 --> 12:50.637
Oh.
I kid.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.439
Of course you do.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.645
You are so good at this.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.680
Are you, like,
a real chef or something?

13:00.713 --> 13:02.149
Professionally?
No, no.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.851
I've got a much
sexier job than that.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.152
Which is?

13:05.185 --> 13:07.187
VP of sales at a
dental products firm.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.956
I know, I know.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.423
It's like meeting
Springsteen, right?

13:10.457 --> 13:12.926
I'm in the dental field, too.
A hygienist.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.161
Small world.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.163
Small, incredibly
boring world, yes.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.265
You know what?
Make yourself useful.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.432
Okay.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.034
So, tell me
about the lucky guy,

13:21.068 --> 13:23.470
Mr. Fiancé.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.804
Howard?
Howard.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.006
He's great.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.108
He is a widower.

13:28.141 --> 13:32.612
He is a loving father and
a wonderful dermatologist.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.613
Hmm.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.148
He has a...

13:35.182 --> 13:36.649
dog, uh...

13:36.683 --> 13:39.286
You know, he's not
exactly Ryan Gosling,

13:39.319 --> 13:40.888
but I'm not exactly

13:40.921 --> 13:43.523
whatever the female equivalent
of Ryan Gosling is.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.658
Scarlett Johansson.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.661
The point is,
he loves me.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.697
Howard Blatt loves me.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.165
And he is kind to me.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.800
And he will
take care of me.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.202
And I finally realized that

13:55.235 --> 13:57.170
that's actually
all I want in a man.
Hmm.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.705
Are you single?

13:58.738 --> 14:00.140
Yeah.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.074
Divorced, actually.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.209
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.244
How long were
you together?

14:04.277 --> 14:05.678
Week and a half.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.680
Got a girl pregnant,
couldn't hack it,

14:07.714 --> 14:08.848
ran for the hills.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.350
Well, relationships
are hard.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.718
Yeah.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.186
You're very sexy.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.322
(laughs)
Okay, um...

14:15.355 --> 14:17.424
Do you always hit
on engaged women?

14:17.457 --> 14:19.559
Not always.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.029
No. I can stop if
you want me to.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.196
No, I'm good.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.565
But I don't even
know your name.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.234
Stosh.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.201
Stosh? (laughs)

14:28.235 --> 14:29.669
It's Polish.
Oh.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.038
I was born in Poland.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.505
The country?

14:32.539 --> 14:33.506
As opposed to what?

14:33.540 --> 14:34.541
I don't know.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.875
And you are?

14:35.909 --> 14:37.844
I am Jewish.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.779
Well, adopted by the Jews.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.681
No, I meant... I
meant your name.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.916
(laughs):
Oh, right, right.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.584
"Jewish" isn't
my actual name.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.586
Can you imagine?
Jewish Goldfarb.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.687
Redundant.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.523
Oh, my God.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.858
Caryn! I'm Caryn.

14:51.891 --> 14:52.926
Caryn.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.461
Nice to meet
you, Caryn.

14:54.494 --> 14:55.528
(doorbell buzzes)

14:55.562 --> 14:56.429
(gasps)

14:56.463 --> 14:57.764
Oh, my God,
that's Howard.

14:57.797 --> 15:00.033
I'm coming!
Then get rid
of Howard.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.235
It's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be okay.
Yeah.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.704
Monkey buns? You here?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.639
Howard!

15:06.673 --> 15:08.041
Hi.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.709
Who's this?
Stosh.

15:09.742 --> 15:10.910
Lewandoski.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.980
Neighbor.
Oh, hey. Howard Blatt.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.314
Great to meet you.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.049
So what brings you
by here, Stosh?

15:16.083 --> 15:19.452
I was actually
helping Caryn to cook

15:19.486 --> 15:22.655
for the engagement party,
which was supposed to be

15:22.689 --> 15:24.591
a surprise, Howard!

15:24.624 --> 15:26.826
So you can meet the
whole gang from...

15:27.961 --> 15:29.896
...the book club.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.099
The book club gang!

15:33.133 --> 15:36.369
(opera music playing)

15:38.371 --> 15:40.173
Mmm.

15:40.207 --> 15:43.010
Spaghetti.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.485
Oh, here's a good one.
Okay, those are my sons.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.154
That's Bartholomew;
he's 11.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.588
And then Milton
just turned eight.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.456
ERIC: Aw, now who's
this little fellow?

15:56.489 --> 15:57.857
He looks just like you.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.492
Th-That is me.

16:00.893 --> 16:03.496
So, Howard, the boys must be
pretty excited

16:03.530 --> 16:05.798
about their future
step-mom to be, huh?

16:05.832 --> 16:07.667
Uh...

16:07.700 --> 16:09.802
It's a bit of a work
in progress at the moment.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.204
Milton has some...

16:11.238 --> 16:12.972
Pretty violent
tantrums.
...minor concerns.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.807
But I'm sure he's gonna be fine
once Caryn moves in,

16:14.841 --> 16:16.276
and he sees what
a beautiful person she is.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.710
CARYN:
Aw...

16:17.744 --> 16:19.212
A-And the medication
will help a lot, too.

16:19.246 --> 16:22.482
Just read that article I gave
you, but you're so sweet.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.451
Hey, speaking of reading,
I'd love to know

16:24.484 --> 16:26.353
what's the last book
you folks have read?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.789
Well, it's a novel about a woman

16:29.822 --> 16:32.492
who's in her late 30s
who decides to become a nun.

16:32.525 --> 16:33.726
Very sad story.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.062
It's called
The Death of Passion.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.530
Actually, she's
in her mid-30s.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.731
And it was crap.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.633
Passion is such
a fleeting thing.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.635
That's why I'm a big fan
of masturbation.

16:42.669 --> 16:43.636
(gasps)

16:43.670 --> 16:44.571
Me, too!

16:44.604 --> 16:46.139
Hey...
(laughs)

16:46.173 --> 16:47.140
That's awesome.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.642
Um... Stosh?

16:49.676 --> 16:54.181
I-I need your expertise in
the kitchen with the cheese.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.484
Ow! What was that for?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.352
The looks, the comments.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.221
You are ruining
my engagement party.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.656
Hey, it's my
engagement party.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.058
I pulled this whole
thing together.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.160
On very short
notice, I might add.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.495
Now, come on.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.197
You don't want to
marry this guy.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.832
Why do you have such a hard time
respecting my choice?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.534
I don't know.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.704
I guess it's a choice I'd expect
from someone less...

17:17.737 --> 17:18.771
hot.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.273
(stammers)

17:20.307 --> 17:21.508
Thank you.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.842
But, you know,

17:22.875 --> 17:24.744
people make their choices

17:24.777 --> 17:26.713
for very different reasons.

17:26.746 --> 17:27.947
Well, you and I made some

17:27.980 --> 17:29.849
interesting choices
earlier tonight.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.684
That was just a momentary
lapse in judgment.

17:31.718 --> 17:35.122
You strode in here
with your hair and your pants,

17:35.155 --> 17:37.090
and you fixed
my smoke alarm, okay?

17:37.124 --> 17:39.092
That is a lot
to throw at a girl

17:39.126 --> 17:40.727
who's been drinking Chablis
since lunchtime.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.061
Well, it was nice though,
wasn't it?

17:42.095 --> 17:43.029
No! N...

17:43.062 --> 17:44.063
Yes!

17:44.097 --> 17:45.432
And that is the problem.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.767
I always go for guys like you,

17:47.800 --> 17:51.538
who offer me nothing
but pleasure and excitement.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.106
And at a certain point,

17:53.140 --> 17:56.209
a girl has to give
those things up for stability.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.778
And that moment happens
the second she turns 35,

17:58.811 --> 17:59.946
which I just did.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.047
Two years ago.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.915
So I am gonna marry Howard.

18:02.949 --> 18:05.285
And that thing
that happened between us,

18:05.318 --> 18:07.954
no matter how nice
or pleasurable

18:07.987 --> 18:09.722
it may have been,

18:09.756 --> 18:11.624
can never, ever happen again,

18:11.658 --> 18:15.928
not with you, not with anyone,
ever, ever again.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.134
Son of a bitch!

18:22.802 --> 18:25.004
ERIC:
* Happy birthday

18:25.037 --> 18:27.840
* Mr. President

18:27.874 --> 18:33.146
* Happy birthday to you.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.747
Well, uh,
thank you, Marilyn.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.016
Now let us proceed
to have sexual intercourse

18:37.049 --> 18:38.518
with great vigor.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.119
(laughing)

18:43.390 --> 18:45.192
Thank you.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.193
(sighs)

18:46.226 --> 18:47.394
Howard.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.330
We need to talk.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.067
I can't marry you.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.871
I thought it was the
right thing for me,

18:58.905 --> 19:00.039
but it's not.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.308
It's just not.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.709
And I am so sorry

19:02.742 --> 19:04.143
that I put you through this.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.215
Howard...

19:11.150 --> 19:13.653
You know, Caryn, I'm not blind.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.788
I know I wasn't
your dream come true.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.957
But I really loved you.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.893
And I was kind of hoping
that was enough.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.995
I'm sorry that it wasn't.

19:24.431 --> 19:25.698
Nice meeting everybody.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.234
Sorry I ruined the book club.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.635
ERIC: Good-bye!
Nice meeting you!
ZARA: Bye, Howard.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.738
(door opens, closes)

19:41.180 --> 19:42.815
Hey.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.984
We followed you after you
staggered out of the house.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.587
Yeah, we thought it best
to keep a respectful distance

19:47.620 --> 19:49.889
until you were done crying
and punching trees

19:49.922 --> 19:51.724
and trying to steal
other people's children.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.560
Plus, Eric
wanted a churro.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.027
I would give you some,

19:55.061 --> 19:56.596
but Stosh tried to take it,
so I licked it.

19:56.629 --> 19:57.864
Think that's
gonna stop me?

19:57.897 --> 19:58.831
Stosh...

19:58.865 --> 20:00.300
Thank you.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.576
You know, Eric,
I always thought

20:09.609 --> 20:11.844
you were the weird
loner on the block.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.247
But tonight I realized

20:14.281 --> 20:15.448
it's me.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.517
If I were normal,
I would be her.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.453
Marrying a man
I truly loved,

20:20.487 --> 20:22.422
who loved me back just as much.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.357
Or a little bit more for safety.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.858
But I can't get there.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.193
What is wrong with me?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.629
What are they saying
to each other?

20:29.662 --> 20:33.099
What does it sound like
when all the pieces fit?

20:33.132 --> 20:34.701
You're in luck.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.068
I read lips.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.136
That is lucky.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.137
Okay, let me see.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.106
(clears throat)

20:40.139 --> 20:42.809
"The love you share
is a blessed gift

20:42.842 --> 20:47.213
bestowed upon us by our Lord
and savior, Jimmy Carter."

20:47.246 --> 20:49.148
Or "Johnny Carson."

20:49.181 --> 20:51.484
It's a "J.C." name,
I do know that.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.386
Those are just hard
to get sometimes.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.255
"Maytag, Hickey.

20:56.289 --> 20:59.091
Would you like
to replace your cows?"

20:59.125 --> 21:02.829
STOSH: "Maytag, the moment
we met, I thought to myself,

21:02.862 --> 21:05.998
"'Damn, them some
tig old bitties.'

21:06.032 --> 21:08.935
And then some other stuff
happened, and now here we are."

21:08.968 --> 21:11.270
ZARA:
"Darling, our love

21:11.304 --> 21:13.072
"is forever symbolized

21:13.105 --> 21:15.842
"by this blood diamond,
the value of which could feed

21:15.875 --> 21:18.811
"and vaccinate a third-world
country, but whatevs.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.180
It makes my friends
super jealous."

21:21.213 --> 21:23.516
STOSH: "Speaking of
your friends, I can't decide

21:23.550 --> 21:25.318
"which of the bridesmaids
I want to bang more,

21:25.352 --> 21:27.654
"number two or number three,
or both.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.657
I feel like if three was into
it, two would get on board."

21:32.191 --> 21:34.994
ZARA: "My beloved, if you
so much as look at them again,

21:35.027 --> 21:37.263
I will divorce your testicles
from your body."

21:37.296 --> 21:38.765
(crowd aahing)

21:38.798 --> 21:39.932
"And now,

21:39.966 --> 21:41.834
"by the powder infested in bees

21:41.868 --> 21:43.503
by Jiminy Cricket..."

21:43.536 --> 21:46.473
Or "Jim Carrey." It's one
of the two, I can't tell.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.874
I'm pretty sure it's Jim Carrey.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.843
ERIC: "I now pronounce you
Malomites.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.445
You may fist with pride."

21:52.479 --> 21:54.347
(crowd aahing, applause)

21:58.250 --> 21:59.786
(sighs)

21:59.819 --> 22:01.688
I still want to do it.

22:03.556 --> 22:06.225
Enough of this. I see an
open bar with our name on it.

22:06.258 --> 22:07.994
(Eric laughs)

22:08.027 --> 22:10.497
Just blend in,
just blend in.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.799
* Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

22:12.832 --> 22:14.834
* Ce soir

22:14.867 --> 22:16.936
* Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

22:18.871 --> 22:23.075
* He sat in her boudoir
while she freshened up *

22:23.109 --> 22:25.344
* The boy drank all that
magnolia wine... *

22:25.378 --> 22:27.514
All right. (chuckles)

22:27.547 --> 22:29.181
I'm having so much
fun right now.

22:29.215 --> 22:31.017
I never want to go home!

22:31.050 --> 22:32.351
I don't have a home!

22:32.385 --> 22:34.320
Shh! Yes, you do!

22:34.353 --> 22:36.088
I'm giving you my house.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.991
Oh, my God! Thank you!

22:39.025 --> 22:40.226
Do you need a roommate?

22:40.259 --> 22:42.729
I just gave away
my house to someone.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.864
CROWD:
Two! Three!

22:45.965 --> 22:47.434
I'm totally getting married!

22:51.471 --> 22:56.008
* Hey, hey, hey...

22:56.042 --> 22:58.010
ZARA: Ooh, anyone want
to hit a strip club?

22:58.044 --> 22:59.879
ERIC: Uh, we need to
stop at home first.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.014
I got to get these pink
roses in water ASAP.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.883
STOSH: You may be
a whole bag of crazy,

23:03.916 --> 23:06.619
but the prize for weird loner
goes to the big guy at the end.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.521
Thank you.
CARYN:
Um, Stosh, you do realize

23:08.555 --> 23:10.222
you're gonna die
alone, too, right?
God willing, Cindy.

23:10.256 --> 23:12.091
It's Caryn.
Whatever.

Good night.
