WEBVTT

00:10.011 --> 00:14.004
Maybe you ought to come on inside.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.347
Are you trying to glamour me?

00:19.854 --> 00:21.060
Yes.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.222
-That doesn't work on me.
-Why not?

00:24.400 --> 00:26.265
I don't know. Itjust doesn't.

00:29.113 --> 00:30.853
ls Bill available?

00:31.657 --> 00:33.613
Let her in.

00:36.287 --> 00:38.949
Diane, let her in.

00:39.123 --> 00:42.035
-Oh, fuck him.
-You have.

01:15.868 --> 01:19.156
If y'all excuse me and Bill a minute...

01:19.330 --> 01:21.992
...we have some business to attend to.

01:23.376 --> 01:25.116
Where'd you find this?

01:28.005 --> 01:32.339
Man, she smells fucking sweet.

01:32.510 --> 01:35.126
And to thinkjust five minutes ago
you were telling us...

01:35.304 --> 01:38.512
...how you were living
mainly on synthetic blood.

01:38.683 --> 01:41.925
-You big poser.
-I don't know, Malcolm.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.843
She looks like a virgin to me.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.512
That's none of your damn business,
you nosy bitch.

01:46.691 --> 01:49.023
It is my business, cupcake.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.729
You wanna know why?

01:57.368 --> 02:00.326
Well, second best. The best would be--

02:00.496 --> 02:02.828
-Baby's blood.
-Yeah.

02:03.958 --> 02:07.166
| get hard just thinking about it.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.203
Ladies first.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.295
Stop.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.172
Sookie is mine.

03:54.985 --> 03:58.148
Well, if you're Bill's...

03:58.322 --> 04:02.235
...I certainly don't wanna do anything
to disturb your little arrangement.

04:04.495 --> 04:08.454
That's why I always bring Jerry with me
wherever I go.

04:09.834 --> 04:12.792
He's like mad money.

04:12.962 --> 04:15.169
Somebody needs
to get down on my johnson.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.840
Oh, she's innocent.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.756
-She's mine.
-Yeah, yeah, we got it.

04:28.102 --> 04:33.642
So why aren't you over there
taking care of your master, human?

04:33.816 --> 04:36.148
Can't you see how hungry he is?

04:37.695 --> 04:38.901
Bill, if you're hungry...

04:39.071 --> 04:41.357
...you're more than welcome
to have some of Jerry.

04:57.465 --> 05:00.377
Come on, suck it.

05:05.139 --> 05:08.302
Stick them in already.
Get infected, you fucking vampire asshole.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.558
Come on, do it.
Let's see how you like hep D.

05:10.728 --> 05:12.889
You fuckers won't be able to move
for a year.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.054
Stop, he has hep D!

05:16.066 --> 05:18.899
-What is hep D?
-Fucking bitch.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.565
How does she know that?
I didn't tell a soul.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.025
These fuckers killed Marcus.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.909
If he hadn't gotten hooked on V,
he never would have left me.

05:37.421 --> 05:42.541
Well, this has all been very illuminating.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.419
But we've got a long ride
back to Monroe...

05:46.597 --> 05:52.433
...and I'm sure we'll all wanna have
a little talk with Jerry when he wakes up.

05:52.603 --> 05:55.015
Out, Janella. We're being evicted.

05:56.482 --> 05:58.097
Hey.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.601
Isn't anyone even
the slightest bit interested...

06:01.779 --> 06:05.112
...in how this little bitch
knew about Jerry?

06:06.825 --> 06:09.282
You can't speak yet,
can you, sweetheart?

06:12.623 --> 06:14.534
I could make her talk.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.954
Diane, you forget.

06:18.128 --> 06:22.371
Yeah, yeah. She's yours.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.878
Whatever.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.968
Jerry, you stupid bitch.

06:29.139 --> 06:32.267
Nobody fucks with me
and gets away with it.

06:57.668 --> 07:00.125
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.632
Your visit was unexpected.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.177
What's hep D?

07:15.728 --> 07:18.185
Hepatitis D is the only
blood-borne pathogen...

07:18.355 --> 07:20.732
...to which we are susceptible.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.857
-Malcolm must be furious.
-Hepatitis?

07:24.028 --> 07:27.395
A mutation. Relatively harmless
to humans, oddly enough.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.359
I've never even heard of it.

07:29.533 --> 07:33.025
-We've kept it out of the media.
-And it makes you sick for a year?

07:33.203 --> 07:34.784
No.

07:35.039 --> 07:37.200
Just makes us weak
for about a month or so.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.619
The biggest danger to us from hep D...

07:39.793 --> 07:42.284
...is being captured and staked
during that time.

07:42.463 --> 07:45.955
Yeah. You don't want your weaknesses
to be public knowledge.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.839
Precisely.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.251
And what the hell did you mean,
"Sookie is mine"?

07:50.429 --> 07:53.136
l was communicating to the others
that you were my human...

07:53.307 --> 07:55.468
...and was the only one
who could feed on you.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.180
You most certainly cannot feed on me.

07:58.354 --> 08:02.063
Of course I can't, but had they known that,
they'd have considered you fair game.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.565
I wouldn't have been able to stop them.
It would be three against one...

08:05.736 --> 08:07.897
...and Malcolm is older and quite strong.

08:08.072 --> 08:11.360
And you and Diane dated?

08:12.159 --> 08:16.027
We had sex once.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.906
Just after she was made a vampire
back in the late 1930s.

08:21.085 --> 08:23.747
What? Gross.

08:23.921 --> 08:27.163
Bill, she's so-- They're all so mean, so--

08:27.341 --> 08:30.629
Evil. Yes, they are.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.172
They share a nest.

08:33.347 --> 08:36.259
And when vampires live in nests,
they become cruel...

08:36.433 --> 08:39.391
...more vicious.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.019
They become laws unto themselves.

08:45.067 --> 08:49.811
Whereas vampires such as I,
who live alone...

08:51.115 --> 08:53.606
...are much more likely
to hang onto some semblance...

08:53.784 --> 08:55.240
...of our former humanity.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.204
Here.

09:02.626 --> 09:05.618
Contact info
for two electrical contractors.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.788
They're willing to come out at night
and give you quotes.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.957
-Thank you.
-l have to go.

09:11.135 --> 09:13.626
-May | kiss you goodnight?
-No.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.887
I couldn't stand it after them.

09:27.359 --> 09:30.021
-Why are you still here?
-I don't wanna go home.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.402
-Okay.
-Night, y'all.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.776
-Night, Dawn.
-Night.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.451
Can I have one of those?

09:43.667 --> 09:46.750
I guess. Long as you're not on the clock.

09:53.302 --> 09:57.671
Sam, you think Sookie's getting serious
about that vampire?

10:00.601 --> 10:02.842
I think she's getting to know him.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.060
Once she does,
I don't think she'll be getting too serious.

10:06.231 --> 10:09.439
I think he's getting
pretty damn serious about her.

10:10.778 --> 10:11.813
How so?

10:11.987 --> 10:14.478
l was over at the Stackhouses'
last night.

10:14.656 --> 10:19.366
He came over to call on Sookie.
All cleaned up and smelling nice.

10:19.536 --> 10:24.246
Looking like he just stepped out of
some movie about plantations and shit.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.623
Do you know he actually owned slaves?

10:27.211 --> 10:30.294
Least he could have done
was apologize to me.

10:30.881 --> 10:33.543
How'd Miss Stackhouse feel
about a vampire in her house...

10:33.717 --> 10:35.799
...interested in her granddaughter?

10:35.969 --> 10:38.130
Sam, she seemed like
she was in seventh heaven.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.216
It was fucking weird.

10:43.811 --> 10:47.269
You know you don't have
anybody to blame but yourself.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.893
Obvious you're carrying a big one
for Sookie.

10:51.068 --> 10:52.729
I've known it ever since I met you.

10:52.903 --> 10:55.565
That's really not any of your business,
now, is it?

10:55.739 --> 10:59.402
She's always been, well,
peculiar around men.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.828
I mean, she's not gonna
make the first move.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.951
Do l have to remind you
that I'm your boss?

11:04.122 --> 11:05.157
Oh, come on, Sam.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.948
Don't try to pull any of that
"working for the man" shit.

11:08.126 --> 11:11.459
You should have said something and
you know it. How come you never have?

11:11.630 --> 11:13.666
How come you never said anything
to Jason?

11:14.550 --> 11:17.383
Because I'm comfortable
with him being right where he is...

11:17.553 --> 11:19.794
...which is unattainable.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.682
Which is part of
my whole fucked-up thing.

11:22.850 --> 11:26.559
Low self-esteem, childhood trauma,
blah, blah, snore.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.264
What's your excuse?

11:28.438 --> 11:32.727
You know, not everybody likes to lay
their guts out on the table like that, Tara.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.766
Yeah, they might not like it...

11:34.945 --> 11:38.779
...but they all dream about finding
somebody they can do it with.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.739
You know what the funny thing is?

11:49.877 --> 11:54.416
I kind of did let Sookie know
for the first time night before last.

11:55.299 --> 11:58.632
Not even a minute before that vampire
walked through my front door.

11:58.802 --> 11:59.791
Well, if I were you,

11:59.970 --> 12:02.632
I would get in there right now
while you still got a shot.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.343
No, you wouldn't.
You just said so yourself.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.132
Well....

12:14.359 --> 12:17.977
-She can't hear his thoughts.
-For real?

12:19.698 --> 12:22.235
Well, that explains everything.

12:24.870 --> 12:28.078
I told her she can listen to my thoughts
whenever she wanted to.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.455
She doesn't wanna
listen to anybody's thoughts.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.332
She wants to not hear them.

12:32.502 --> 12:35.539
But that requires
constant work on her part.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.171
And now she's met somebody...

12:38.550 --> 12:41.587
...and she can drop all that effort
and just relax.

12:41.762 --> 12:45.630
Oh, man, you don't stand a chance.
I'm really sorry, but you don't.

12:45.807 --> 12:49.425
-You know, you can go home any time.
-No, I can't.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.343
Really.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.827
-You kept me waiting.
-Oh, God.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.867
I don't like to wait.

13:16.546 --> 13:20.038
-I need to taste you again.
-Come on, Jason.

13:20.217 --> 13:24.051
I probably should have told you
I've got a highly addictive nature.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.883
I'm gonna get some more
of that sweet stuff out of you.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.719
I guess you don't have
too much of a problem with that.

13:31.228 --> 13:34.061
Don't fight me, because I will hurt you.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.055
What are you to me?

13:36.233 --> 13:41.193
Just another idiot slut
who puts out for vampires.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.065
Oh, yeah. Here we go.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.191
I knew you liked it.

13:49.705 --> 13:52.242
Slow down. I'm in no hurry.

13:52.416 --> 13:56.534
| just drained that poor fuck
you left tied up to the bed.

13:56.712 --> 13:59.294
Very considerate of you, by the way.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.750
Oh, God! Where is he? Oh, no!

14:01.925 --> 14:05.042
-Which part of him?
-This isn't happening.

14:05.220 --> 14:10.180
What'd you expect me to do? You
laid him out like an all-you-can-eat buffet.

14:10.350 --> 14:14.263
Although he did put up quite a fight.

14:24.614 --> 14:25.945
-You!
-Oh, yeah.

14:26.116 --> 14:29.529
That is not funny.
That is not funny!

14:29.703 --> 14:33.036
Yes, yeah. Yeah.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.788
Just think of it as foreplay, baby.

14:36.460 --> 14:39.202
Do it again. Do it again.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.046
Give me some of that sweet stuff.

15:23.673 --> 15:28.007
Goddamn it, Bill. How many times
do l have to tell you? Do not do that.

15:28.887 --> 15:32.175
I'm sorry. It wasn't intentional.
| just got here.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.599
I wanted to make sure
that you were safe.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.942
Why can't I hear your thoughts?

15:46.113 --> 15:48.900
Do you even have any thoughts?

15:50.909 --> 15:52.524
Oh, I have thoughts.

15:53.787 --> 15:57.700
-Many lifetimes of thoughts.
-So why can't I hear them?

15:59.709 --> 16:01.415
I don't know.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.370
Perhaps it's because
I don't have brain waves.

16:04.548 --> 16:05.708
Why not?

16:05.882 --> 16:07.588
Because I'm dead.

16:07.759 --> 16:11.217
No, you're not.
You're standing here talking to me.

16:11.388 --> 16:15.506
l have no heartbeat.
l have no need to breathe.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.263
There are no electrical impulses
in my body.

16:19.437 --> 16:22.179
What animates you
no longer animates me.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.973
What does animate you then?

16:25.152 --> 16:26.733
Blood?

16:27.237 --> 16:30.900
How do you digest it if nothing works?

16:31.074 --> 16:32.860
-Magic.
-Oh, come on, Bill.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.320
I may look naive, but I'm not.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.996
And you need to remember that.

16:37.164 --> 16:40.748
You think that it's not magic
that keeps you alive?

16:42.043 --> 16:45.251
Just because you understand
the mechanics of how something works...

16:45.422 --> 16:48.414
...doesn't make it any less of a miracle.

16:48.592 --> 16:51.675
Which is just another word for magic.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.513
We're all kept alive by magic, Sookie.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.968
My magic's just a little different
from yours, that's all.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.769
I think we need
to stop seeing each other.

17:06.943 --> 17:10.026
-Why?
-Because you don't breathe.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.279
You don't have any electrical
whatever-it—is.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.781
Your friends would like
to rip my throat out.

17:14.951 --> 17:18.364
And vampires killed that preacher
from the Fellowship of the Sun church...

17:18.538 --> 17:20.574
...and his wife and baby.

17:20.749 --> 17:23.741
You look me in the eye
and tell me they didn't do it.

17:24.461 --> 17:28.955
Humans have killed millions upon millions
in senseless wars.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.963
I do not hold you responsible for that.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.546
Bill, night before last,
I had to bury my clothes...

17:33.720 --> 17:37.053
...because I didn't want my grandmother
to find out l was almost killed.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.839
Tonight, l was almost killed again.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.133
Why on earth
would I continue seeing you?

17:47.567 --> 17:51.310
Because you will never find a human man
you can be yourself with.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.820
-SooMe.
-Do not touch me.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.990
Just go, please.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.588
Thanks.

18:21.393 --> 18:22.929
So...

18:23.687 --> 18:26.303
...can I ask you a personal question?

18:26.481 --> 18:27.937
Sure.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.892
Why is it you don't wanna go home?

18:32.070 --> 18:33.776
This right here.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.441
My mama's a drunk.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.326
Not just a slurs-her—words drunk...

18:42.497 --> 18:45.614
...a waking-up-in-her-own-vomit
kind of drunk.

18:46.835 --> 18:47.870
I'm sorry.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.456
| just can't be around her
when she's gone like that.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.665
Yeah.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.377
I know she may end up dying...

18:54.551 --> 18:57.634
...lighting herself on fire
with a lit cigarette...

18:58.179 --> 18:59.214
...but I can't.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.970
I won't.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.849
So, see,
not only is the whole situation horrible...

19:05.020 --> 19:08.183
...my guilt about it
just makes it that much worse.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.143
Why don't you get your own place?

19:11.318 --> 19:13.525
Well, why don't you give me a raise?

19:17.240 --> 19:20.858
-Had she ever tried AA?
-She doesn't need AA, Sam.

19:21.036 --> 19:23.152
She's got Jesus.

19:28.418 --> 19:32.036
Can I ask you a personal question?

19:35.633 --> 19:37.214
Hold on.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.218
All right.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.929
Are you lonely?

19:47.354 --> 19:48.935
Yes.

19:50.190 --> 19:53.774
I am. I am very-- Very lonely.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.071
How come you don't have a girlfriend?

19:57.238 --> 19:59.274
Plenty of women in this town
will go for you.

19:59.449 --> 20:02.782
-I don't know if that's true.
-You're hot, you have a job.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.817
You're not a serial killer.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.408
-Yeah, who could resist that?
-Well?

20:07.582 --> 20:10.949
-Why don't you have a boyfriend?
-We're not talking about me right now.

20:14.339 --> 20:16.204
Yeah, well...

20:17.133 --> 20:21.126
...| just have a hard time opening up,
that's all.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.635
Oh, please.

20:22.806 --> 20:26.219
What have you got to hide
that's so fucking bad in this fucking town?

20:26.393 --> 20:29.305
No, Tara. I said I have a hard time
opening up, and I meant it.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.720
-l'm not gonna do it.
-Don't you ever get horny?

20:33.316 --> 20:35.147
Sure.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.063
How long has it been
since you've had sex?

20:43.535 --> 20:45.275
-A few months.
-That sucks.

20:45.453 --> 20:48.320
-How about you?
-Eight months, three weeks.

20:48.498 --> 20:51.410
-That sucks.
-You don't know.

20:52.001 --> 20:55.493
Well.... Well, I guess you do.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.924
-Hey, you want another one?
-Are you kidding?

21:02.095 --> 21:05.963
I'm an adult child of an alcoholic.
I'll need at least three more.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.426
All right.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.642
-|'|| be right back.
-All right.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.528
So maybe you and I
should sleep together.

21:31.749 --> 21:35.207
-Yeah, right.
-No, I mean, we're grownups.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.994
No strings. Friends with benefits.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.333
Tara, you're my employee.

21:39.507 --> 21:42.169
Sam, aren't you sick of not getting laid?

21:42.343 --> 21:44.925
-I know I am.
-Yeah, but that doesn't mean--

21:45.096 --> 21:47.678
-You have any condoms?
-Tara.

21:47.849 --> 21:52.639
-That's a terrible idea.
-All right. Whatever.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.724
I mean, I am not looking for a boyfriend.

21:55.899 --> 21:58.140
Especially one who can fire me.

21:58.318 --> 22:03.403
This would strictly be a one-time deal.
We never even have to mention it again.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.484
No.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.274
Suit yourself.

22:21.090 --> 22:25.083
You really think you'd be able
to not let it affect our working relationship?

22:25.261 --> 22:29.049
I've had to do much harder things
than that in my life, believe me.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.886
If it got weird,
I'd probably have to let you go.

22:33.061 --> 22:36.849
Big deal. You didn't even
wanna hire me in the first place.

22:41.945 --> 22:43.526
Okay.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.569
Yeah?

22:47.951 --> 22:49.441
Great.

22:57.418 --> 23:00.251
-You feel nice.
-Yeah, I know I do.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.106
What's wrong?

23:28.032 --> 23:30.148
Jason,baby.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.109
What is it?

23:36.583 --> 23:38.824
I hate that you've been with vampires.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.084
And how exactly is that
any of your business?

23:41.254 --> 23:43.495
Well, they're fucked up, Dawn.
They're freaks.

23:43.673 --> 23:45.129
They're fucking dead.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.337
What's wrong with you,
letting something nasty like that touch you?

23:48.511 --> 23:50.627
That was the best sex
I ever had in my life.

23:50.805 --> 23:52.170
And who are you to judge?

23:52.348 --> 23:54.555
You fuck anything
with a space between its legs.

23:54.726 --> 23:57.217
Best sex? You told me
l was the best sex you ever had.

23:57.395 --> 24:00.182
Yeah, and then you stopped calling
and coming to Merlotte's.

24:00.356 --> 24:03.268
And then I met that vampire.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.808
Which vampire?

24:04.986 --> 24:07.523
Bald-headed, tattoos, crazy?

24:10.408 --> 24:14.242
No. Actually, he had a lot of hair.

24:15.705 --> 24:18.868
I met him in Shreveport
at the vampire bar.

24:19.042 --> 24:21.203
And you just let him bite you?

24:21.544 --> 24:22.909
Yeah, and I'm not--

24:23.087 --> 24:25.078
-l'm not ashamed of that.
-You ought to be.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.838
You ought to get off your high horse.

24:28.593 --> 24:30.208
That who you thought I was tonight?

24:30.386 --> 24:33.048
When you started rubbing up against me
like a cat in heat?

24:33.222 --> 24:37.181
-No, baby. I knew all along it was you.
-You're a lying sack of shit.

24:37.352 --> 24:39.684
You would fuck that vampire
and let him bite you...

24:39.854 --> 24:41.685
-...if he showed up tonight.
-All right.

24:41.856 --> 24:45.269
Now this is getting boring.

24:45.735 --> 24:48.147
And I think you should leave.

24:49.447 --> 24:51.529
And you gonna throw me out?
I don't think so.

24:51.699 --> 24:54.031
-This is my house.
-And I ain't going nowhere.

24:54.702 --> 24:56.658
God, just because you lost your hard-on...

24:56.829 --> 24:59.411
...doesn't mean you have to have
a fucking meltdown.

24:59.582 --> 25:00.867
Believe it or not, Jason...

25:01.042 --> 25:03.374
...the world does not revolve
around your dick.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.921
-Where are you going?
-To get a cigarette!

25:06.089 --> 25:08.580
It isn't like I don't know
that you're a great fuck.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.874
Happens to every guy
at some point or another.

25:11.052 --> 25:14.215
Would you stop talking about it, please?

25:14.972 --> 25:16.883
Every guy except for vampires.

25:21.020 --> 25:24.478
-Does it look like I'm laughing?
-You should be.

25:24.649 --> 25:27.766
You do not own me, Jason Stackhouse.

25:27.944 --> 25:32.278
And if I want you out of my house,
you better get your sorry ass out of here.

25:33.241 --> 25:35.607
-I ain't going nowhere.
-Oh, yes, you are.

25:37.370 --> 25:42.364
You are obnoxious and full of yourself
and dumber than a box of hair.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.908
And now you can't even get it up?

25:45.086 --> 25:47.498
There's no reason
why I should be seeing you anymore.

25:47.672 --> 25:49.958
-You're fucking crazy.
-You bet your ass I am.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.966
-Get the fuck out of my house.
-Let me get my pants on.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.717
I don't think | feel like waiting.

25:56.264 --> 26:00.303
-Get the fuck out!
-Goddamned woman.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.762
That's right,
you get the fuck out of my house!

26:02.937 --> 26:05.929
Limp-dick motherfucker!
Why don't you go fuck your grandmamma...

26:06.107 --> 26:07.893
-...with that limp dick?
-Bitch!

26:08.067 --> 26:09.978
I can get it up!

26:10.820 --> 26:12.276
Bitch!

26:16.784 --> 26:20.026
Yeah, you heard me.
Your neighbor's a crazy bitch!

26:26.544 --> 26:29.160
Goddamn bloodsuckers.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.169
Fuck!

26:56.991 --> 26:59.152
Sookie, don't ever sneak up
on a vampire.

27:01.204 --> 27:02.364
What are you doing here?

27:02.538 --> 27:06.827
All right, here's the deal.
And this is a little embarrassing.

27:07.001 --> 27:10.789
I've never been with a man intimately,
for all the reasons I told you about...

27:10.963 --> 27:13.796
...but I feel things when I'm with you
that make me think.

27:13.966 --> 27:17.299
And I know this could be a huge mistake,
one I will regret forever...

27:17.470 --> 27:20.837
...but it feels like you're the one
that I'm supposed to do it with...

27:21.015 --> 27:24.678
...and I'm really nervous about that,
and frankly, I'm scared to death of you.

27:24.852 --> 27:29.061
So can we just get it out of the way already
so I can relax and get a good night's sleep?

27:34.237 --> 27:35.568
Just don't bite me, okay?

28:29.208 --> 28:30.948
Stop that.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.176
You gotta be kidding me.

29:28.184 --> 29:30.926
--vampires assassinated my father
because of his campaign...

29:31.103 --> 29:32.513
...against the vampire agenda.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.349
Theodore New/in is a hero.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.855
-First casualty in World War III.
-Amen.

29:37.026 --> 29:38.266
It's Armageddon.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.684
-Amen.
-Amen.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.818
[intend to continue my father's work--

29:41.989 --> 29:45.231
Vampire bats are hats that feed on blood.

29:45.451 --> 29:48.614
Feeding on the blood of animals
like cows, pigs and horses.

29:48.788 --> 29:51.700
The vampire bat
requires about two tablespoons--

29:52.500 --> 29:54.036
Damn it.

29:55.503 --> 29:58.961
Oh, Malcolm. Come on, baby.

30:01.008 --> 30:05.547
Damn. I really liked Jerry.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.136
Don't worry.

30:08.307 --> 30:11.799
We'll find you
another hot little blood bag.

30:11.978 --> 30:15.721
Let's go down to LSU tomorrow night
and raid us a frat house.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.555
Yes.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.850
I'm in the mood for something dumb,
thick and juicy.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.992
What luck.
lt's everyone's favorite buzz kill.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.456
-Hey, baby.
-Yo, Mr. Mainstream.

30:40.631 --> 30:42.132
Thirsty?

30:42.299 --> 30:46.212
-No.
-Hungry for something else?

30:47.722 --> 30:51.635
I remember you
having a very sizeable...

30:52.309 --> 30:53.719
...appetite.

31:00.151 --> 31:03.439
The three of you will stay away
from me and Sookie from now on.

31:04.155 --> 31:08.239
I'm your elder.
You have no authority here.

31:08.409 --> 31:13.028
-There are higher authorities.
-l'm not afraid of Eric.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.661
Higher than him.

31:14.832 --> 31:17.448
Well, then she can speak to me.

31:17.626 --> 31:20.754
She can suck on sunlight for all I care.

31:20.921 --> 31:22.786
You are doing nothing to help our cause.

31:22.965 --> 31:26.799
Not everyone wants to dress up
and play human, Bill.

31:26.969 --> 31:29.802
Yeah. Not everybody
wants to live off that Japanese shit...

31:29.972 --> 31:31.473
...they call blood, either.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.629
As if we could.

31:32.808 --> 31:36.892
We have to moderate our behavior
now that we are out in the open.

31:37.313 --> 31:40.350
Not everybody thinks
that it was such a great idea.

31:40.524 --> 31:44.733
And not everybody intends
to toe the party line.

31:46.697 --> 31:49.530
Honey, if we can't kill people,

31:49.700 --> 31:52.863
what's the point of being a vampire?

31:53.746 --> 31:55.452
Where's Jerry?

31:56.749 --> 31:59.081
We left him on the side of l-20.

31:59.502 --> 32:01.868
Well, most of him, anyway.

32:02.046 --> 32:04.332
I kept a souvenir or two.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.751
And Janella felt so bad
about what Jerry did...

32:10.930 --> 32:14.013
...she made the ultimate sacrifice.

32:25.402 --> 32:28.690
-You know, y'all make me sick.
-You used to be fun.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.148
This all on account
of that little blond breather?

32:33.661 --> 32:37.620
If you insist on flaunting your ways
in front of mortals...

32:38.374 --> 32:40.330
...there will be consequences.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.336
Asshole.

33:28.215 --> 33:30.922
-Where the hell you been, you dirty whore?
-Mama.

33:31.093 --> 33:33.709
Out all night
doing all kinds of God-know-what.

33:34.138 --> 33:38.222
You the devil, child.
You ain't no child of mine.

33:38.392 --> 33:40.929
-Oh, Jesus.
-Jesus ain't gonna help you.

33:41.103 --> 33:43.219
Yeah, that's been clear
for quite some time.

33:43.397 --> 33:47.857
You sass the Lord and I will kick
your skinny ass, you hear me?

33:48.027 --> 33:52.111
You can't even stand up,
you pathetic, ugly old bitch.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.288
Shit. Oh, Mama.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.957
-Sorry.
-I ain't ugly.

34:10.132 --> 34:12.874
Oh, Mama,
why do you wanna do this to yourself?

34:13.052 --> 34:16.169
If Jesus was here,
he'd take one look at you...

34:16.347 --> 34:19.885
...and he'd apologize
for giving me such a spiteful child.

34:20.059 --> 34:23.847
You kidding? Jesus wouldn't even
set foot inside this house.

34:24.021 --> 34:26.307
Not with the way you smell.

34:26.482 --> 34:30.976
Now, let'sjust go
and take a shower, okay?

34:31.153 --> 34:33.314
Let me lift you up.

34:35.157 --> 34:36.988
Who's ugly now?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.194
All right.

34:43.165 --> 34:46.328
You may have carried me
and nursed me...

34:47.628 --> 34:50.085
...but obviously
you are now set on killing me.

34:50.256 --> 34:56.627
And if I'm forced to choose
between you and me, guess what?

34:56.887 --> 34:57.922
You lose.

34:59.348 --> 35:01.464
You get back here. You help me up.

35:02.518 --> 35:05.100
You on your own, old woman.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.898
SooMe.

35:20.160 --> 35:24.244
You're gonna faint
out here in this heat, honey.

35:24.790 --> 35:29.625
lt's barely 9:00 and already 80 degrees.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.251
Here, I made you some lemonade.

35:31.422 --> 35:33.754
-Fresh-squeezed.
-Thanks, Gran.

35:35.718 --> 35:37.879
Goodness, what has got into you?

35:40.014 --> 35:42.721
| just need to stay busy right now,
that's all.

35:42.891 --> 35:45.883
-What? How long have you been--?
-I started when the sun came up.

35:46.061 --> 35:48.894
But I was up much earlier than that.
ljust stayed inside.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.980
Are you concerned about the vampire?

35:55.154 --> 35:57.566
SooMe,
has he done something untoward?

35:58.157 --> 36:01.820
No. No, not at all.

36:04.038 --> 36:07.496
Well, I'm just thinking....

36:08.792 --> 36:10.908
What I'm thinking is stay away...

36:11.086 --> 36:15.250
...but what I'm feeling--
What I'm feeling with my whole body...

36:15.424 --> 36:18.086
...is something else entirely.

36:18.260 --> 36:22.754
And I don't know
whether to trust my head or....

36:25.392 --> 36:26.427
Head.

36:28.312 --> 36:29.973
Yes.

36:31.106 --> 36:33.222
Well, that is a dilemma.

36:33.901 --> 36:36.142
Come inside and let me
make you something to eat.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.060
If you're out working like a horse...

36:38.238 --> 36:40.274
...at least have something
in your stomach.

36:40.449 --> 36:45.113
-Oh, no, thanks. I'm not hungry.
-I didn't ask if you were hungry.

36:54.296 --> 36:57.880
I'm coming.
Hell, beating on my fucking door.

36:58.467 --> 37:00.003
Damn.

37:03.639 --> 37:06.881
She hit me with a fucking liquor bottle.
My head is bleeding.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.345
-Will you stop yelling? I got a guest.
-Oh, shit.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.011
-He in the shower.
-Do you think I'll need stitches?

37:12.189 --> 37:14.305
Let me see. No.

37:14.483 --> 37:16.974
You just need to put
some peroxide on that...

37:17.152 --> 37:20.394
...then take two Vicodin
with a big glass of red wine.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.314
Then smoke some badass ganja, baby.

37:23.492 --> 37:24.982
By the time you wake up:

37:25.619 --> 37:27.359
All healed.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.452
Here.

37:30.332 --> 37:33.415
One, two.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.371
Mind if I stay here for a while?

37:35.546 --> 37:37.127
-Does it matter if I mind?
-Nope.

37:37.297 --> 37:39.003
Then do you.

37:41.176 --> 37:42.791
Damn.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.922
After everything I've done
for that woman.

37:45.097 --> 37:48.214
Poor baby. Here.

37:48.392 --> 37:49.882
Suck on this.

37:50.060 --> 37:53.177
lt'll make you feel a lot better.

37:57.109 --> 37:58.849
Oh, hi.

37:59.862 --> 38:02.353
This is my cousin Tara. Tara, this is--

38:02.531 --> 38:04.112
Duke. Duke Smith.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.362
Boyfriend, you are so not a Duke.

38:10.497 --> 38:12.453
I left the...in the....

38:12.624 --> 38:14.831
-Excellent, excellent.
-All right.

38:15.586 --> 38:18.919
-For the road?
-All right.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.546
Thank you.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.553
-Call me when the...comes in.
-I will.

38:27.723 --> 38:30.339
Ta-ta. Take care, Duke.

38:32.936 --> 38:35.518
-What the hell was that?
-That was a state senator.

38:35.689 --> 38:39.853
-You're a prostitute now?
-l'm an entrepreneur.

38:41.278 --> 38:42.859
What?

38:43.238 --> 38:46.196
I'm supposed to be satisfied
being a fucking short-order cook...

38:46.366 --> 38:47.742
...and working on a road crew?

38:47.910 --> 38:50.492
Which is basically one step
from the chain gang.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.072
But I ain't complaining, baby.

38:52.247 --> 38:54.989
No, I ain't,
because it gives me this body.

38:56.418 --> 38:59.581
And this body's gonna be
my fucking ticket.

38:59.755 --> 39:03.589
Yes, it is. How else am I gonna get ahead
in this Podunk town?

39:05.761 --> 39:08.252
Already got a website.

39:08.430 --> 39:09.590
Sure do.

39:09.765 --> 39:11.221
What's wrong with us, Lafayette?

39:11.391 --> 39:13.598
You're a
state-senator-fucking prostitute...

39:13.769 --> 39:17.557
...and I'm a bartender in a redneck bar
who fucks her boss.

39:17.731 --> 39:19.687
Who's in love with her best friend.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.440
Here, just take another hit off this.

39:28.575 --> 39:30.782
Wait a minute. You slept with Sam?

39:32.204 --> 39:36.117
You know what? He barks in his sleep.

39:36.625 --> 39:40.459
-Oh, damn. White folks just all fucked up.
-Yeah, that's what I said.

39:45.467 --> 39:49.005
Hey, what's up, my brother? Hey.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.753
Oh, hell.

39:51.932 --> 39:54.639
"Starbucks coming to Marthaville."

39:55.477 --> 39:59.766
Wonder if I'm gonna break down
and get a goddamn cappuccino machine.

40:01.483 --> 40:02.984
Hey.

40:03.694 --> 40:06.731
You know what I really wish
would come to Marthaville?

40:07.906 --> 40:09.407
Buffy.

40:09.992 --> 40:11.948
Or Blade.

40:12.661 --> 40:16.654
Or any one of those badass vampire killers
who'd take care of Mr. Bill Compton.

40:16.832 --> 40:18.663
That's what I wish.

40:20.127 --> 40:22.334
You don't care about
my problems at all, do you?

40:22.504 --> 40:25.416
You just wanna play, huh?
One-track mind.

40:25.591 --> 40:28.799
Ready? Ready? Go. Go get it.

40:28.969 --> 40:30.800
Marthaville's getting a Starbucks.

40:32.264 --> 40:36.633
I cannot for the life of me see why anybody
would spend $3 on a cup of coffee...

40:36.810 --> 40:38.391
...with too much milk.

40:38.562 --> 40:41.019
Arlene told me
people are less calcium-deficient...

40:41.189 --> 40:45.182
...than they used to be because of
all the fancy coffee they drink nowadays.

40:45.527 --> 40:48.439
You know, I never thought of that,
but it does make sense.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.872
Hey, Gran.

40:59.207 --> 41:02.449
Do you think I should continue
seeing Bill?

41:03.712 --> 41:05.327
SooMe”.

41:06.715 --> 41:07.921
...I can't tell you that.

41:08.091 --> 41:13.552
I can tell you that I think
he is a smart, handsome...

41:13.722 --> 41:15.883
...and very polite young man.

41:16.058 --> 41:19.050
But of course
he's gonna show his best side to me...

41:19.227 --> 41:22.139
...so that I won't stand in the way
of his courting you.

41:24.107 --> 41:26.268
He scares me.

41:27.486 --> 41:33.482
Well, it is scary opening your heart up
to somebody.

41:34.368 --> 41:40.079
I think it's a little scarier
with a vampire than with a regular guy.

41:40.791 --> 41:42.952
lsuppose.

41:43.502 --> 41:48.417
Bill is the first vampire I ever met
that I know of.

41:48.590 --> 41:51.832
Not scared that he would ever hurt me.

41:52.010 --> 41:56.674
Scared because
I don't know what he's thinking.

42:01.228 --> 42:05.892
I would imagine that
that wouldn't be such a bad thing for you...

42:06.066 --> 42:09.604
...with your...ability.

42:19.788 --> 42:24.327
You know, your grandfather
used to know things.

42:27.629 --> 42:28.960
What things?

42:29.131 --> 42:32.794
If somebody was having money problems,
running around behind their wife's back.

42:32.968 --> 42:34.674
Sick. That kind of thing.

42:34.845 --> 42:37.928
Personal things they never would have
told anybody about.

42:38.098 --> 42:41.682
See, that's exactly it.
If I don't stop myself from it...

42:41.852 --> 42:44.810
...I hear everybody's deepest,
darkest secrets.

42:44.980 --> 42:47.437
I'm sorry,
that's just too much information.

42:47.607 --> 42:50.815
But then Earl's brother,
your great-uncle Francis...

42:50.986 --> 42:53.568
...came back from Korea
in real bad shape.

42:53.739 --> 42:56.606
All torn up from the things he'd seen.

42:57.284 --> 43:00.902
Earl knew he was thinking
about killing himself.

43:01.079 --> 43:03.661
He went over there
in the middle of the night one night.

43:03.832 --> 43:07.165
Francis was just about to kick the chair out
from underneath him.

43:07.335 --> 43:10.668
Already had the noose around his neck.

43:11.089 --> 43:14.001
But Earl talked him out of it.

43:16.636 --> 43:21.847
ljust think there is a purpose
for everything that God creates.

43:22.434 --> 43:25.551
Whether it's a unique ability...

43:25.896 --> 43:29.354
...or a cup of overpriced coffee
with too much milk.

43:29.524 --> 43:30.639
Or a vampire.

43:33.111 --> 43:36.729
God will reveal that purpose
when the time is right.

43:47.042 --> 43:48.532
Wait.

43:48.835 --> 43:52.623
I thought Great-Uncle Francis
did kill himself, with a shotgun.

43:53.089 --> 43:56.673
Oh, yes, he did, but that was years later.

44:03.016 --> 44:06.383
Hold on, goddamn it. Shit.

44:07.187 --> 44:08.643
What the damn fuck, huh?

44:09.815 --> 44:12.181
Well, hello, hotness.

44:12.359 --> 44:13.815
Lafayette, I need your help.

44:14.611 --> 44:18.854
I am so glad
you finally recognized that truth.

44:19.449 --> 44:21.906
You're wearing gold pants.

44:25.705 --> 44:27.832
So, what you need?

44:33.255 --> 44:34.995
Do you have any...

44:35.757 --> 44:37.418
...Viagra?

44:37.926 --> 44:39.416
What?

44:40.136 --> 44:43.503
Viagra. Do you have any Viagra?

44:45.684 --> 44:47.970
-No.
-Seriously?

44:48.144 --> 44:51.762
-I thought you had everything.
-Jason, puppy dog...

44:51.940 --> 44:53.726
...Viagra is legal.

44:53.900 --> 44:55.436
You can buy it in the drugstore.

44:55.610 --> 44:58.898
Yeah, I know, but I need it now.

45:00.115 --> 45:01.605
Don't you have anything that would--?

45:01.783 --> 45:04.946
Give you wood so hard
a saw couldn't cut through it?

45:05.328 --> 45:08.240
Yeah, that sounds good. I think.

45:09.374 --> 45:11.706
Yeah. I do.

45:12.794 --> 45:14.876
-But it's very expensive.
-Well, how much?

45:15.046 --> 45:18.959
-Six hundred a quarter of an ounce.
-Get the fuck out of here.

45:19.134 --> 45:21.466
What in the hell's worth
that kind of money?

45:37.277 --> 45:38.983
When'd you start dealing V?

45:39.154 --> 45:42.362
When I realized there was a market for it.

45:42.908 --> 45:46.275
Now, I don't want this getting out,
motherfucker. Do you understand me?

45:46.453 --> 45:48.318
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:48.496 --> 45:51.659
The vamps don't take kindly
to the juice dispenser.

45:51.833 --> 45:53.164
Where'd you get it?

45:53.335 --> 45:58.671
Let's just say l have an arrangement
with a certain life-challenged individual...

45:58.840 --> 46:02.708
...who appreciate
my multi-faceted talents.

46:02.928 --> 46:04.668
Goddamn.

46:04.846 --> 46:08.054
Is there anybody who isn't
fucking vampires these days?

46:08.224 --> 46:09.930
Tell me something, lover.

46:10.101 --> 46:11.966
Do you wanna get it up and keep it up...

46:12.145 --> 46:15.683
...and have the best sex you have ever had
for both you and your lady friend?

46:15.857 --> 46:17.017
Yes, yes, yes.

46:17.192 --> 46:20.025
Take one, maybe two drops of this.
No more.

46:20.195 --> 46:21.230
Okay.

46:21.404 --> 46:25.773
Any more and things might get a little
intense, and I don't mean in a good way.

46:33.792 --> 46:36.329
Thanks, man. Appreciate it.

46:38.004 --> 46:40.541
Ain't nothing free in my world.

46:42.759 --> 46:44.875
Can I pay you later?
I need to run to the bank.

46:45.053 --> 46:47.510
Motherfucker, who you think I am?

46:48.223 --> 46:50.054
Look, I don't run a layaway program.

46:51.101 --> 46:55.891
-And I ain't interested in instituting one.
-Oh, come on, Lafayette.

46:56.064 --> 46:59.227
Isn't there some way
you can let me pay you this afternoon?

47:01.403 --> 47:03.894
Goddamn it, I hate video cameras.

47:04.072 --> 47:07.155
You know how much you could make
if you had your own website?

47:07.325 --> 47:09.566
Queens all over this world
would pay good money...

47:09.744 --> 47:11.359
...just to watch you jack off.

47:11.538 --> 47:15.577
-Hey, you said all I had to do was dance.
-Okay.

47:18.670 --> 47:20.410
Dance.

47:24.259 --> 47:26.045
Is anybody gonna see this
who knows me?

47:26.219 --> 47:28.835
Probably. There's a lot of pervs
in this town.

47:29.014 --> 47:31.926
Okay, no way. That's not cool, man.

47:32.642 --> 47:34.257
Look...

47:34.769 --> 47:36.100
...do you want the V or not?

47:39.607 --> 47:41.108
Give me the fucking mask.

47:42.444 --> 47:44.560
That's my Jason.

47:48.616 --> 47:50.117
What the fuck?

48:00.045 --> 48:01.535
I like what you're working with.

48:09.137 --> 48:11.173
Shake that ass.

48:12.724 --> 48:15.215
Oh, lover,
you gonna make me clutch my pearls.

49:41.104 --> 49:42.719
-Hello?
-Hey, Sookie, it's Sam.

49:42.897 --> 49:45.229
-Could you do me a favor?
-Sure, maybe.

49:45.400 --> 49:49.359
l'm set to open for lunch in 20 minutes and
Dawn still hasn't shown up for her shift.

49:49.529 --> 49:51.986
Oh, Sam, I really need my day off.

49:52.157 --> 49:53.567
I'm not asking you to come in.

49:53.741 --> 49:57.905
| just need you to run by Dawn's
and wake her up. She probably overslept.

49:58.079 --> 49:59.740
Okay.

50:12.427 --> 50:13.963
Dawn?

50:15.013 --> 50:16.924
It's me, Sookie.

50:18.474 --> 50:19.600
Honey, you overslept.

50:32.989 --> 50:34.604
Dawn?

50:38.286 --> 50:40.117
Are you here?

50:45.126 --> 50:46.536
Dawn?

50:49.631 --> 50:51.246
Dawn?

50:54.052 --> 50:55.588
Dawn?
