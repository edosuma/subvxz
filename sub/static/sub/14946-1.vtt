Tell me everything.

00:06.757 --> 00:08.213
My name is Kiera Cameron,

from the year 2077.

00:14.265 --> 00:15.425
Who is this?

00:15.516 --> 00:17.802
CPS Officer Cameron.

00:18.436 --> 00:19.801
How are you on my computer?

TRAVIS:
The revolution is
on our schedule.

00:22.815 --> 00:24.646
The war begins now.

00:25.443 --> 00:27.183
Alec.
You lost a bet, right?

00:27.278 --> 00:29.439
Right, because smart
and funny is such
a step down?

00:30.406 --> 00:31.771
Emily, it's okay.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.239
I love you, too.

00:34.493 --> 00:35.949
KELLOG: You know who else
will be heartbroken?

00:36.287 --> 00:38.448
Alec, after he learns
you work for Escher.

00:38.998 --> 00:40.659
EMILY:
/ need you to pull me out.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.741
He loves you,

(GRUNTS)

00:47.381 --> 00:48.370
It's me.

00:48.591 --> 00:50.172
I need a clean-up
on location one.

00:50.259 --> 00:51.294

01:05.483 --> 01:06.973
I have to accept
the truth,

01:07.985 --> 01:09.100
that I may never
get back to him.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.412
You know, I've had

01:22.500 --> 01:24.331
It looks like
some of it is

01:24.418 --> 01:25.794
Do you even know

01:25.878 --> 01:26.958
Probably Thailand?

01:27.171 --> 01:28.707
Really?
You have to hop on

01:28.798 --> 01:30.663

Travis got into the lab.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.344
You gave him access.

He's going after Escher,

01:56.200 --> 01:57.531

01:57.702 --> 01:59.909

KIERA:
How much time

out what we're up to?

destroy the device

02:33.446 --> 02:35.186

device for his own needs
instead of sending you home.

left your time,

its way into the hands
of criminals,

12:13.150 --> 12:15.141
who saw only opportunity.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.731

and the technology
was confiscated,

12:23.869 --> 12:25.951

had already been done.

12:26.038 --> 12:29.405
The only way to prevent
these abuses was to put
in place a safety net,

around an idea.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.995

to protect history.

12:34.463 --> 12:37.876
We would react
to these incursions
and minimize their impact.

to journey back 1,000 years

to establish an order,

12:42.846 --> 12:43.961
a temple of a sort.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.178
He built a following
that would evolve
over time,

from the future

You could have
put an end to all

mentioned sacrifice.

of all of this,

you personally, Kiera...

Destiny is not set.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.142
Time is not immutable.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.438

used his time travel weapon,

13:49.413 --> 13:52.200
he created
a whole new branch

A new story.

13:54.751 --> 13:57.584

in this timeline.

13:58.213 --> 14:00.249
Do you know
what that means?

14:03.093 --> 14:06.130
He'll never grow up
to be the Alec Sadler
of 2077.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.754
He will never
create his empire.

14:09.683 --> 14:10.843
Your future.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.344
KATHERINE: It means,
in a roundabout way,

14:12.436 --> 14:15.269
that we are all now fighting
for the same thing, Kiera.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.221
Continuity.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.769
For us, it means
the tree will remain
cultivated and healthy.

14:23.739 --> 14:26.856
For you, it means
you can return
to your family.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.988
But that might
never happen now.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.119
By allowing Alec
to travel back,

14:33.206 --> 14:35.288
we've all become
complicit in a crime.

14:35.625 --> 14:39.117
And unfortunately,
due to the nature
of this crime,

14:40.047 --> 14:41.787
there's not much
my people can do.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.297
But, you,
on the other hand,

14:46.970 --> 14:49.211
you might be able
to correct this mistake

14:49.473 --> 14:51.464
and get home
to your loved ones.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.894
I'm still listening.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.474
Hello?

14:59.441 --> 15:01.181
Anybody? Anybody here?

15:12.370 --> 15:14.110
We don't
have much time.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.992
What are you doing?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.544
I'm disabling all the CCTV
surveillance in this place.

15:22.631 --> 15:23.916
All right.
We can't be spotted.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.248
I also have to keep
tabs on other me.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.584
I can do that by
tracking his cell phone.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.929
Oh, and get the suit.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.173
Oh, the suit.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.350
KELLOG: Ooh,
what happened
to your face?

15:42.859 --> 15:43.894
Huh?

15:43.985 --> 15:45.521
Your, uh, yourface.

15:46.696 --> 15:47.856
What, is it bad?

15:48.490 --> 15:50.321
KELLOG: It's actually
kind of badass.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.615
What happened?
Did you get into a fight?

15:52.702 --> 15:53.782
Huh?

15:53.870 --> 15:55.986
Yeah, sort of.
It's complicated.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.662
It always is.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.406
You okay?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.540
Yeah.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.119
Okay.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.249
So, listen,
we need to talk about...

16:05.340 --> 16:06.750
No, you listen.

16:06.842 --> 16:07.831
Excuse me?

16:07.926 --> 16:09.837
Look, I don't know what
kind of messed up
scheme you're planning

16:09.928 --> 16:11.759
with Sonya and Travis,
but it's not
happening anymore.

16:11.847 --> 16:12.962
I'm changing
all the door codes

16:13.056 --> 16:14.466
and getting rid
of that other CPS suit,

16:14.558 --> 16:17.595
so you won't be leveraging
that or anything else
to save your own skin.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.051
Understood?

16:19.604 --> 16:20.593
Um...

16:21.106 --> 16:22.095
I would never...

16:22.190 --> 16:24.146
(SCOFFS) Trust me,
you already did.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.771
Okay, slow down.

16:27.863 --> 16:30.605
What's all this about, kid?
You seem a little rattled.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.447
Not yourself.

16:32.576 --> 16:33.736
(DEVICE BEEPING)

16:34.369 --> 16:36.030
I can't talk about it.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.986
Is something going on
with your girlfriend?

16:38.707 --> 16:39.787
You stay away from Emily.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.956
She's not really my type.
Besides, I found out...

16:42.043 --> 16:43.624
Stay away.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.829
Fine, I'll stay away.
But you need to know...

16:46.923 --> 16:48.834
I already know
what I need to know.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.465
Okay, you're scaring me.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.175
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.878
You want to protect
your future?

16:54.973 --> 16:56.429
You know I do.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.007
Then start focusing
on the real threat.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.562
Escheh

17:06.276 --> 17:08.517
In a few hours,
Kiera's gonna arrest Lucas
and recover the rest

17:08.612 --> 17:11.354
of the time travel device.
KELLOG: Is that right?

17:11.448 --> 17:12.858
So...

17:12.949 --> 17:15.440
So, if Escher gets
his hands on it,
he will use it.

17:17.329 --> 17:18.614
Okay.

17:18.955 --> 17:21.071
Sure, butwithout
an adequate power source,
he's...

17:21.166 --> 17:22.372
ALEC: He's got one.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.324
Escher built
an anti-matter lab
at Piron

17:24.419 --> 17:26.375
designed specifically
for the time travel device

17:26.463 --> 17:28.454
that you and
Liber8 brought back.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.423
You're supposed to be
so smart, you do the math.

17:40.310 --> 17:41.390
Okay, so what?

17:41.478 --> 17:45.437
Escher goes back
to the time we all
arrived and kills us all.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.564
After that...

17:48.777 --> 17:51.359
VVeH,Iguess
the world's his oyster.

17:52.322 --> 17:53.983
That's how
you stay on top.

18:00.163 --> 18:01.699
So, you and your friends
are supposed

18:01.790 --> 18:03.246
to protect the timeline.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.541
That's right,
and we've been doing
just that for 1,000 years.

18:06.962 --> 18:10.079
Didn't everything get
screwed up when I came
back here with Liber8?

18:10.465 --> 18:13.707
Wasn't a new branch
of your tree created
at that point?

18:13.802 --> 18:14.917
Indeed.

18:15.011 --> 18:18.003
And the reason
we were collecting people
like you and Liber8

18:18.098 --> 18:20.384
is so we could repair
the damage you've caused.

18:21.184 --> 18:22.469
Were collecting?

18:22.686 --> 18:24.802
That is no longer
a viable option.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.688
Alec has caused
a much larger problem.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.061
But if everything's
already gone haywire,

18:32.279 --> 18:33.940
how am I supposed
to make a difference?

18:34.030 --> 18:35.770
That's just it, Kiera.

18:36.408 --> 18:37.818
When it comes to history,

18:38.535 --> 18:39.866
the scale's irrelevant.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.410
KATHERINE:
Thousands can perish
and nothing will happen,

18:42.497 --> 18:45.079
but one person can
radically shape history.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.995
Alec Sadler is one
of those people.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.206
Maybe you are, too.

18:54.217 --> 18:57.334
Ithink you're all
out of your minds.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.673
I think you're delusional.

18:59.973 --> 19:00.962
Kiera.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.013
You killed
Agent Gardiner,

19:03.518 --> 19:07.102
positioned me to take
the blame in order
to get me out of the way,

19:07.188 --> 19:08.724
and now you want
to be friends?

19:09.065 --> 19:10.350
Things changed.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.273
I'll say.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.895
Let me go,
and I'll think about it.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.029
We can't let you go.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.823
KATHERINE:
Don't miss out
on an opportunity

19:20.910 --> 19:22.616
to help yourself, Kiera.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.997
Help everyone.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.491
I think we're done here.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.992
(BOTH GRUNTING)

21:23.908 --> 21:25.023
Holy shit.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.824
Let's grab what
we can and book.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.368
Who are they?

21:30.081 --> 21:31.161
Why do you think I know?

21:31.249 --> 21:32.364
A hunch?

21:32.542 --> 21:33.873
They seem to be
interested in you.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.289
Some kind of cult.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.163
From as near
as I can tell,

21:40.258 --> 21:43.591
they've kept the lid
on time travel for as far
back as you can go.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.548
Formed some kind
of secret society

21:45.638 --> 21:47.503
to stop people
from changing history.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.135
We should burn this
place to the ground.

21:49.350 --> 21:50.305
What about the others?

21:50.393 --> 21:53.385
There's no time.
This place will be on
lock down any minute.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.394
You in or out?

21:56.065 --> 21:57.145
What about us?

21:57.567 --> 21:58.647
When we get out of here?

22:01.404 --> 22:02.484
You don't mess with me,

22:02.572 --> 22:03.561
I won't mess with you.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.154
I warned you
she'd be difficult.

22:13.416 --> 22:16.374
She's CPS,
she's not gonna wake up
as easily as you think.

22:16.461 --> 22:18.452
They've been brainwashed
to think a certain way.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.831
She'll eventually
see the logic.

22:19.923 --> 22:21.584
Bythen
it'll be too late.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.665
I told you killing
Gardiner was a mistake.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.417
It doesn't matter.

22:26.095 --> 22:29.553
There are more important
considerations for Kiera.
Leave it to me.

22:29.641 --> 22:30.926
(SCOFFS)

22:31.518 --> 22:34.100
She's a mother.
You wouldn't understand.

22:34.729 --> 22:37.687
MAN OVER PA:
Unauthorized exit, Sector 1.
We have a security breach.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.184

Hey, you realize
you change one thing

22:46.324 --> 22:48.315
a whole bunch
of other stuff's gonna
change because of it.

22:48.409 --> 22:49.444
It occurred to me.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.777
Yeah, well you might
wanna be careful about
what you change because...

22:51.871 --> 22:52.860
Gotcha!

22:54.165 --> 22:55.280
Alec?

22:57.252 --> 22:58.458
Hello?

JASON: Oh.

23:06.386 --> 23:07.501
Okay.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.264
We shouldn't.

23:21.359 --> 23:22.474
Uh,yeah.

24:37.769 --> 24:39.851
We should double back.
Throw them off.

24:40.688 --> 24:42.724
They'll go past,
we'll keep them
ahead of us.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.063
Exactly.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.234
You're acting weird.

24:53.117 --> 24:55.699
What? Can't a guy admire
his beautiful girlfriend?

24:56.245 --> 24:57.234
Isuppose.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.871
What happened
to your head?

25:02.293 --> 25:04.158
Oh, Itook
a pretty good bump.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.413
Knocked me out, even.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.332
I've been forgetting
things, too,

25:07.423 --> 25:09.209
so ifyou see me
and I forgot everything
since last time,

25:09.300 --> 25:10.915
that's probably why.

25:12.595 --> 25:13.801
Uh-huh.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.546
Uh,so,ThaHand.

25:17.225 --> 25:18.214
Excuse me?

25:18.309 --> 25:19.515
We should go.

25:20.436 --> 25:23.394
(STUTTERS)
I've always wanted
to go to Thailand.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.013
Yeah, me too.

25:25.108 --> 25:26.473
Great minds think alike.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.527
When do you want to go?

you're serious?

25:43.626 --> 25:45.287
Listen, I need
to tell you something.

25:47.088 --> 25:48.453
That's okay.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.375
Whatever you need
to tell me

25:50.466 --> 25:51.546
won't change the way
Ifeelaboutyou,

25:51.634 --> 25:53.670
or change my mind
about leaving.

25:56.514 --> 25:57.720
Now, I'm gonna go
take care of things,

25:57.807 --> 25:59.263
I'll call you, okay?

26:07.650 --> 26:09.766
(SIGHS)
This is gonna work.

26:12.822 --> 26:13.982
Kiera.

26:26.794 --> 26:27.909
Nice maneuver.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.873
Pulled something similar
back in the rebellion,

26:29.964 --> 26:31.420
only it worked
out backwards.

26:31.507 --> 26:32.622
How's that?

26:32.717 --> 26:34.799
I ran the same flanking
maneuver by my lieutenant,

26:34.886 --> 26:37.127
he thought
it was a great idea,
only we did an end run.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.758
I got caught in the rear
and fell behind.

26:44.228 --> 26:47.095
I watched
as my entire squad
got captured

26:47.190 --> 26:48.851
and taken prisoner.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.855
I only escaped because
I fell, Iwas stupid.

26:53.905 --> 26:55.736
Stupid saved your ass.

26:56.657 --> 26:57.988
That time.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.786
This place is a maze.

27:03.873 --> 27:05.534
It's full of rats.

They're gonna find us.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.292
I'll divert,
stall them and give
you a chance to escape.

No, I'll do it.

You can bring the cops.

Stupid won't save
my ass this time.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.260
All right,
I'll come back here
with the police,

28:01.347 --> 28:04.259
bust you out,
and we'll shut down
this operation.

to draw them, and then go.
