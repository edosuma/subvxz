00:34.635 --> 00:36.227
Hey, Mom, you down here?

00:37.271 --> 00:40.729
Clark, I thought you went to the hardware
store with your father.

00:40.908 --> 00:44.571
We were on our way, then Dad remembered
he had the part he needed in the barn.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.704
What are you doing down here?

00:46.881 --> 00:51.079
I came down to get some peaches
for dessert. I'll be right up.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.480
Okay.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.626
Well, that ought to do it.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.333
That was fast.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.901
I offered Dad a bit of spot welding,
but he said it'd slow him down.

02:19.073 --> 02:22.008
As hard as it is to believe,
your abilities are no substitute...

02:22.176 --> 02:24.235
...for a 3/4-inch copper washer.

02:24.645 --> 02:28.547
Well, it sounds like the two of you deserve
a nice, cold glass of lemonade.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.042
Mom, you all right?

02:49.737 --> 02:50.965
Martha!

02:51.539 --> 02:55.441
Dad, she's not breathing. Mom? Mom!

02:56.243 --> 02:58.006
Martha?

04:06.179 --> 04:08.511
The good news is we've managed
to stabilize her.

04:08.682 --> 04:09.910
She's breathing on her own.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.574
I don't understand.
She worked outside all morning.

04:12.752 --> 04:17.086
She seemed fine. How could something
come over her so quickly?

04:17.290 --> 04:19.781
My guess is we're dealing
with some sort of toxin.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.793
I'll have a better idea after we finish
her blood work.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.397
All right. I'm gonna stay right here.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.329
I'll have an orderly bring you some coffee.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.133
Thank you.

04:33.473 --> 04:34.963
She's gonna be okay.

04:35.308 --> 04:36.832
I know that, son.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.738
I also know that she wouldn't want us both
out here standing guard.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.142
I'm not leaving.

04:42.315 --> 04:45.910
Your mother had a list of things
she needed to get done for the fundraiser.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.520
You know how important
the food bank is to her.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.088
All right.

04:53.159 --> 04:56.219
As soon as I'm finished, I'm coming back
to camp out with you.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.973
I thought that your mom was bringing over
the prizes for the raffle.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.673
She was, but she came down
with something this morning.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.512
My dad's at the hospital with her.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.784
Hospital? It sounds serious.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.386
Any idea what's wrong?

05:23.556 --> 05:26.684
- They're waiting on some test results.
- They have to know something.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.886
- What were her symptoms?
- What is this, an interview?

05:33.666 --> 05:35.395
She stopped breathing, okay?

05:42.108 --> 05:46.010
No, I appreciate the thought, Lana,
but she's gonna be okay...

05:46.179 --> 05:48.704
...and she'd be really disappointed
if we cancelled.

05:49.449 --> 05:52.316
- Clark, I didn't mean to just...
- It's okay, Chloe.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.417
I'm gonna get back to the hospital.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.610
Mr. Kent?

06:23.116 --> 06:26.847
I know we've already gone over this,
but I'm gonna ask you one more time.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.545
Has Martha been exposed to any
unusual substances over the last few days?

06:30.723 --> 06:33.556
Nothing she hasn't been around before.
What is this about?

06:34.160 --> 06:36.287
I've been going over Martha's
blood cultures...

06:36.463 --> 06:39.796
...and her symptoms indicate
an acute toxic reaction...

06:40.166 --> 06:45.160
...but I can't identify the source.
- But you can do something for her, right?

06:48.575 --> 06:52.272
I've sent her blood samples
to Metropolis for further testing.

06:52.812 --> 06:55.440
But I have to be honest with you,
I'm concerned...

06:55.615 --> 06:57.947
...for both Martha and the health
of her baby.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.253
Baby?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.485
You didn't know?

07:06.259 --> 07:09.717
There must be some kind of mistake.

07:09.896 --> 07:12.490
The doctors said that she
could never have a baby.

07:12.799 --> 07:15.893
I asked your G.P. To fax over Martha's
medical records.

07:16.402 --> 07:17.699
There's no mistake.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.577
I saw Mr. Kent in the hall.

07:32.752 --> 07:35.220
He looked worried. Is everything all right?

07:35.722 --> 07:37.485
We're doing everything we can.

07:44.597 --> 07:47.862
Johns Hopkins. Good school.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.832
Go ahead. Read it.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.847
They're offering you
a three-year research fellowship.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.246
I'm impressed.

08:06.953 --> 08:11.447
It's an opportunity to do pure research
at one of the best hospitals in the country.

08:11.624 --> 08:14.787
As opposed to the rural pleasures
of Smallville Medical.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.992
Lex, I like my work here,
but research has always been my first love.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.531
So...

08:25.271 --> 08:26.499
...what do you think?

08:29.542 --> 08:30.770
Trust me...

08:31.778 --> 08:34.611
...there's nothing worse
than a missed opportunity.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.251
Dr. Bryce?

08:43.389 --> 08:47.052
I'm Dr. Neil Moore.
We're here about Martha Kent.

08:49.495 --> 08:51.190
I'll let you get back to work.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.069
A baby?

09:02.775 --> 09:04.766
She didn't tell me anything about it.

09:05.411 --> 09:08.141
- Why would she keep it a secret?
- I don't know.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.114
Mr. Kent.

09:10.683 --> 09:12.947
This is Dr. Moore
with the Disease Control Agency.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.347
Mr. Kent.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.819
Disease? I'm sorry, but what does
that have to do with my wife?

09:18.057 --> 09:21.993
The Disease Control Agency gets called in
whenever it's a matter of public safety.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.829
The Metropolis lab sent them
Martha's blood work.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.397
I don't mean to alarm you...

09:26.566 --> 09:29.831
...but your wife's condition is caused
by some unknown toxin.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.264
We're here to find it and identify it.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.269
Can someone else come down with this?

09:34.440 --> 09:37.170
Frankly, son, we can't know that
until we find the source.

09:37.343 --> 09:41.040
We need to backtrack Mrs. Kent's
movements over the last couple of days.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.306
She hasn't left the farm
since the weekend.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.451
She's been on the phone
doing fundraising.

09:45.618 --> 09:47.279
Then that's where we need to start.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.082
Start what?

09:49.255 --> 09:51.849
Searching your property
for the source of the poison:

09:52.025 --> 09:53.617
The house, the out buildings...

09:53.793 --> 09:56.421
...anything Mrs. Kent might have
come in contact with.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.723
Clark, the ship.

10:21.554 --> 10:24.250
Pete, you're sure the ship will be safe
in your shed?

10:24.424 --> 10:27.723
Yeah. I'll put it between the old Betamax
and my dad's Pong game.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.825
Indiana Jones couldn't find it down there.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.800
Clark!

10:42.675 --> 10:43.903
Clark, what are you...?

10:51.384 --> 10:52.908
Pete, you okay?

10:53.419 --> 10:55.011
I'm fine.

10:56.723 --> 10:57.951
What happened to you?

10:58.558 --> 10:59.786
I'm not sure.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.024
Let's get out of here.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.131
Come on, let's get this thing back
on the road.

11:14.741 --> 11:17.801
Come on, stop fooling around.
I've seen you bench-press a trailer.

11:17.977 --> 11:20.002
- Let's go.
- I'm trying.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.711
I can't do this, Pete.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.143
Clark, X-Files alert.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.589
That's the DCA team.

11:31.758 --> 11:34.158
We've gotta get this thing back
on the road.

11:43.302 --> 11:44.564
We got it.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.681
- Find anything yet?
- No, not yet.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.252
- You got the ship out of there?
- Yeah, it's at Pete's. It's safe.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.525
Dad, when I was driving...

13:14.060 --> 13:17.461
...my vision suddenly blurred
and I lost control of the truck.

13:17.930 --> 13:21.297
- You and Pete are all right, aren't you?
- Yeah.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.332
For a moment, I lost all my strength.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.063
- Dr. Moore.
- Go ahead.

13:26.405 --> 13:28.464
I'm getting a hit in the storm cellar.

13:29.041 --> 13:32.135
I'm registering a positive
for organic particulate matter.

13:32.778 --> 13:36.578
Looks like someone was digging around
and kicked up some sort of irradiated spore.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.041
Get a surface sample.

13:39.218 --> 13:41.652
Ten centimeters and 50 centimeters.

13:57.069 --> 14:01.870
Mr. Kent, we found this in a tin
buried inside your storm cellar.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.038
Have you ever seen it before?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.072
No.

14:07.413 --> 14:10.177
Has Mrs. Kent been down
in that cellar recently?

14:10.449 --> 14:12.679
Not that I know of.
We usually keep it locked.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.184
Actually, Dad,
she was down there this morning.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.018
This is Moore.

14:19.191 --> 14:23.287
I want a cleanup team to sterilize
every inch of that storm cellar.

14:23.930 --> 14:26.956
I don't get it. We've been searching
for that key for months.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.964
How did it end up in the storm cellar?

14:29.135 --> 14:31.968
When I fixed the leak under the sink,
I noticed the flour jar.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.799
Your mother must have moved it.

14:33.973 --> 14:37.136
- Why didn't she tell us she had it?
- She must have her reasons, Clark.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.505
Right now, I'm more concerned
about her health.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.239
Me too. What do you think
those spores are?

14:42.648 --> 14:46.448
I don't know, but whatever they are,
you were exposed to them too.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.484
Maybe that's why you lost your strength.

14:48.654 --> 14:50.815
No, Dad, I just had a glitch.
I'm fine.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.888
You don't have to worry about me.

14:54.961 --> 14:56.622
We need to think about Mom.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.573
Sweetheart.

15:15.381 --> 15:16.678
How you feeling?

15:17.750 --> 15:20.742
I should have told you about the baby.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.982
I'm so sorry.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.155
Why didn't you tell me?

15:26.826 --> 15:30.922
I was worried if I said it out loud,
it would go away.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.533
Martha.

15:41.974 --> 15:43.771
How is it even possible?

15:44.410 --> 15:46.378
The day of the tornado...

15:47.113 --> 15:49.707
...when Nixon opened Clark's ship...

15:50.616 --> 15:52.550
...something strange happened.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.447
And there was a blinding light...

15:57.089 --> 16:02.823
...and I felt a surge of energy
go through my body.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.226
You're saying you think the ship
has the power to heal?

16:06.465 --> 16:10.868
I think the ship made it possible
for me to get pregnant.

16:12.738 --> 16:15.536
However it happened, Martha,
it's a miracle.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.384
They found the key.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.350
In the storm cellar?

16:32.091 --> 16:35.925
- Why did you hide it from us?
- I know it was wrong...

16:36.662 --> 16:41.793
...but I was afraid if Clark
opened the ship...

16:42.935 --> 16:46.268
...and found out the truth
about his origins he'd...

16:47.673 --> 16:49.368
He would want to leave us.

16:50.142 --> 16:53.236
Martha, that's not going to happen.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.154
- Clark.
- Hi, Lana.

17:11.262 --> 17:13.959
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.970
It's weird how random memories
can just pop into your head, huh?

17:26.712 --> 17:29.943
When I was in second grade,
I was afraid to go to school...

17:30.116 --> 17:32.880
...because I thought Mom would disappear
while I was gone...

17:33.052 --> 17:34.644
...and never come back.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.283
I wouldn't even get on the bus...

17:38.457 --> 17:40.857
...until she promised she'd be there
when I got home.

17:42.595 --> 17:43.823
Sure enough...

17:44.130 --> 17:46.826
...every day, there she was when
I walked through the door.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.732
Don't worry, Clark.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.736
In a few days, you'll walk through the door
and your mom will be there again.

18:01.847 --> 18:04.372
Clark, you okay?

18:05.551 --> 18:08.145
Clark. Clark!

18:09.789 --> 18:11.017
Clark.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.425
What happened?

18:21.367 --> 18:24.495
Lana, would you excuse us, please?

18:40.352 --> 18:43.150
Clark was exposed to the same toxin
his mother was.

18:43.422 --> 18:48.018
You should've called an ambulance. He needs
a hospital. We need to inform the DCA.

18:48.194 --> 18:51.095
- I'm sorry, I can't let you do that.
- Why the hell not?

18:53.499 --> 18:56.161
I need you to promise me
that you won't tell anybody...

18:56.335 --> 18:57.859
...about this, and I mean anybody.

18:58.037 --> 19:01.700
Mr. Kent, I take my doctor-patient
confidentiality very seriously...

19:01.874 --> 19:03.398
...but Clark needs proper care.

19:05.611 --> 19:08.671
Doctor, Clark isn't exactly
what you'd call a normal boy.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.479
I need to get a blood sample.

19:13.519 --> 19:16.920
Listen, Dr. Bryce, you can't do that.

19:17.089 --> 19:21.025
- Is this some sort of religious thing?
- No, I mean literally, you can't do that.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.776
You can't take that sample to a lab.

19:50.222 --> 19:51.883
I'm trying to help your son...

19:52.057 --> 19:54.457
...but I can't unless you tell me
what's going on.

19:54.793 --> 19:58.854
You need to promise me that you will do
the lab work on this blood yourself.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.932
If you do the blood work yourself,
I think you'll understand...

20:02.101 --> 20:05.696
...why you can't tell anyone about Clark.

20:26.191 --> 20:27.453
Oh, my God.

20:29.595 --> 20:30.823
Lex.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.297
Came by to see how Mrs. Kent was doing.

20:36.101 --> 20:37.966
I saw the DCA, must be serious.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.299
You know I'm not allowed
to discuss my patients.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.273
The Kents are like family to me,
more than my own.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.543
I know, and I would tell you everything
if I could.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.449
I understand. I just wish there
was something I could do to help.

20:51.650 --> 20:55.609
Unfortunately, modern medicine doesn't
always have the answers.

20:56.622 --> 20:59.420
I guess that's the attraction
of a research fellowship...

21:00.059 --> 21:03.187
...the chance to help unlock
the mysteries of science.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.663
I'd better get back to work.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.037
Helen.

21:20.579 --> 21:23.173
Johns Hopkins will be lucky to have you.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.988
Hi, Mr. Kent.
Lana told me what happened.

22:11.163 --> 22:15.725
- Is Clark okay?
- Yeah, he's just resting on the couch.

22:15.901 --> 22:18.335
I'll be sure to tell him you stopped by
to say hello.

22:18.504 --> 22:22.099
I'm sorry, I must be more annoying
than a door-to-door salesman.

22:22.274 --> 22:25.368
I was wondering if I could just sit
with him for a while?

22:26.612 --> 22:28.580
Yes.

22:28.747 --> 22:31.875
Chloe, I'm sorry. Sure, go on in.

22:32.718 --> 22:35.278
- I'll wait upstairs.
- Okay, thanks.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.137
Hi, Clark.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.771
Well, this is gonna make quite a story.

23:03.048 --> 23:07.007
"Clark Kent Ends Record-Breaking
Perfect Attendance Streak."

23:08.854 --> 23:10.082
Sorry.

23:10.989 --> 23:12.422
I'm doing it again.

23:13.992 --> 23:15.220
I just...

23:16.195 --> 23:21.030
I've never seen you sick before,
and it just got me thinking.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.934
What if something did happen to you...

23:24.970 --> 23:27.370
...and I never got to...?

23:32.010 --> 23:35.468
So in yet another classic maneuver
to avoid emotional intimacy...

23:36.381 --> 23:39.976
...I wrote my feelings down
so that I could read them to you...

23:40.152 --> 23:42.882
...thereby avoiding embarrassing
eye contact.

23:51.396 --> 23:53.591
I want to let you in on a secret.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.531
I'm not who you think I am.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.533
In fact, my disguise is so thin...

23:58.704 --> 24:01.400
...I'm surprised you haven't seen
right through me.

24:03.775 --> 24:07.302
I'm the girl of your dreams masquerading
as your best friend.

24:09.815 --> 24:13.012
Sometimes I wanna rip off this facade
like I did at the Spring Formal...

24:13.218 --> 24:17.882
...but I can't, because you'll get scared
and you'll run away again.

24:19.658 --> 24:24.618
So I decided that it's better to live
with the lie than expose my true feelings.

24:26.064 --> 24:28.191
This is so much easier
when you're unconscious.

24:33.639 --> 24:36.631
My dad told me
there are two types of girls...

24:38.243 --> 24:41.508
...the ones you grow out of
and the ones you grow into.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.274
I really hope I'm the latter.

24:45.784 --> 24:48.184
I may not be the one you love today...

24:49.288 --> 24:53.520
...but I'll let you go for now,
hoping one day you'll fly back to me.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.888
Because I think you're worth the wait.

25:06.104 --> 25:07.469
Clark?

25:10.442 --> 25:11.807
Lana?

25:43.342 --> 25:44.570
Dad.

25:45.410 --> 25:46.843
Clark, you shouldn't be up.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.669
Where are you going?

25:49.581 --> 25:52.448
- I'm going to Pete's to get the ship.
- Now?

25:54.253 --> 25:56.244
How is Mom?

25:59.658 --> 26:00.886
Dad?

26:05.297 --> 26:08.858
Clark, Helen says that your mother probably
won't make it through the night.

26:13.605 --> 26:15.232
And now you too.

26:16.808 --> 26:20.244
You can't think about me.
We gotta help Mom.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.074
I'm not gonna lose my family,
not without a fight.

26:23.515 --> 26:26.507
Now, if it takes a miracle,
I'll have to go out and find one.

26:26.685 --> 26:29.848
The ship.
You think it can cure me and Mom?

26:30.122 --> 26:32.056
I don't know, Clark.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.124
I'm grasping at straws.
The doctors can't help you...

26:35.294 --> 26:37.888
...and your mother thinks the ship
helped her get pregnant.

26:38.063 --> 26:40.031
I don't know, maybe it's crazy.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.496
The only way to get it to work
is with that key.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.096
I know that, son.

26:44.503 --> 26:46.528
I also know where the DCA
took everything.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.672
- I'm going there now.
- I'll go with you.

26:48.874 --> 26:51.809
No. I want you to stay right here,
you're too sick.

26:53.312 --> 26:54.802
Go to bed, son.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.486
Hold it right there. On the ground, now!

30:28.660 --> 30:30.059
Hands at your sides!

30:31.663 --> 30:32.891
Clark!

30:35.166 --> 30:36.929
I thought you could use a hand.

30:55.587 --> 30:57.111
We gotta run, son. Come on!

30:59.057 --> 31:00.957
He's moving down to the gate!

31:18.910 --> 31:20.571
Unlock the gates! Let's go!

32:13.198 --> 32:15.792
Code blue, room 117. Code blue.

32:23.641 --> 32:27.839
This is the DCA.
Stop your vehicle immediately.

32:51.869 --> 32:54.770
Get out of the truck
and put your hands up!

33:04.215 --> 33:06.115
Something wrong, officer?

33:07.318 --> 33:09.878
This guy doesn't fit the description.

33:18.429 --> 33:19.657
Clear.

33:35.112 --> 33:36.340
Come on.

34:09.914 --> 34:11.813
Time of death, 2:17 a.m.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.480
- So is it a boy or a girl?
- Clark...

35:18.649 --> 35:22.210
- Doctor, please, don't answer that.
- We wanna find out the old-fashioned way.

35:22.519 --> 35:26.011
The important thing is that
the baby's healthy and so are you.

35:27.691 --> 35:30.558
In medical terms,
it's nothing short of a miracle.

35:30.728 --> 35:32.855
Your family seems to have
a stockpile of them.

35:36.767 --> 35:39.327
I saw Clark's blood test...

35:39.870 --> 35:43.169
...and I saw Mrs. Kent
make an impossible recovery.

35:44.074 --> 35:46.634
If you know how that happened,
you should tell me.

35:49.346 --> 35:50.836
Just like you said, doc...

35:52.816 --> 35:54.044
...it's a miracle.

36:17.908 --> 36:21.571
Dr. Trenton, I appreciate you keeping me
apprised of the situation.

36:22.713 --> 36:24.408
I shouldn't be doing this.

36:26.884 --> 36:30.479
If anyone finds out I'm giving you a file
on a patient, I could lose my job.

36:36.026 --> 36:39.621
Mrs. Kent was a very sick woman.
What's your interest in her?

36:40.297 --> 36:44.393
She's a good friend of mine.
That's all you need to know.

37:04.288 --> 37:06.347
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:06.523 --> 37:09.617
I ran into Clark in the hall.
He said Martha's gonna be fine.

37:09.827 --> 37:11.192
Congratulations, doc.

37:11.361 --> 37:14.296
Don't know how much I had to do with it.

37:14.498 --> 37:16.432
Then how do you explain it?

37:18.068 --> 37:21.902
Right, I almost forgot,
you can't discuss your patients.

37:22.973 --> 37:24.497
I got you something.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.138
A going-away present?

37:32.416 --> 37:34.247
On the contrary.

37:35.018 --> 37:36.508
Open it.

37:41.492 --> 37:44.950
It's a key to the mansion.
I want you to move in.

37:45.996 --> 37:47.224
Lex.

37:47.998 --> 37:50.626
I'd never want to stand in the way
of your ambitions...

37:52.503 --> 37:56.701
...but I'd be the one missing an opportunity
if I didn't tell you I want you to stay.

38:14.358 --> 38:17.794
- "Attack of the killer mold spores"?
- Yeah.

38:17.961 --> 38:20.930
I'll never look at blue cheese
the same way again.

38:22.566 --> 38:25.933
I couldn't bring myself to go back
and visit Clark when he was sick.

38:26.770 --> 38:28.795
Does that make me a horrible person?

38:29.640 --> 38:31.437
No.

38:32.442 --> 38:35.138
I guess it just really scared me
to see him like that.

38:36.146 --> 38:37.545
Me too.

38:37.714 --> 38:40.547
Kind of makes you realize
who's important in your life.

38:42.319 --> 38:46.688
Yeah. And who's important to Clark.

38:47.925 --> 38:50.393
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

38:52.095 --> 38:55.189
I'm gonna head home
and finish changing for the benefit.

38:56.633 --> 38:58.123
Are the programs ready?

38:58.302 --> 39:00.736
They are, right behind the desk.
I'll see you there.

39:00.904 --> 39:02.166
Thanks.

39:19.957 --> 39:22.118
I want to let you in on a secret, Clark.

39:22.659 --> 39:24.889
I'm not who you think I am.

39:25.062 --> 39:26.620
In fact, my disguise is so thin...

39:26.797 --> 39:29.357
...I'm surprised you haven't seen
right through me.

39:29.900 --> 39:33.927
I'm the girl of your dreams masquerading
as your best friend.

40:27.324 --> 40:29.349
Pete, this is awesome.

40:29.526 --> 40:32.859
Clark. It's good to see you
among the living, man.

40:35.198 --> 40:36.688
Check it out.

40:37.734 --> 40:39.634
It's the latest Talon mix.

40:39.803 --> 40:41.202
Thanks, Pete.

40:42.239 --> 40:45.868
- And thanks for helping with the police.
- No problem.

40:46.043 --> 40:50.571
Although, if I had a choice,
I'd rather play DJ than decoy any day.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.079
So...

40:53.784 --> 40:57.151
...is the investigation over?
- Yeah. I hope so.

41:05.329 --> 41:08.628
- I'll catch up with you later.
- Good seeing you, man.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.228
Hey, Chloe.

41:12.302 --> 41:14.532
My dad said you came to visit
when I was sick.

41:14.938 --> 41:16.929
It was really sweet of you. Thanks.

41:17.274 --> 41:20.004
Sure. What are friends for?

41:21.178 --> 41:24.341
I'm just gonna go buy a raffle ticket
before the drawing.

41:27.084 --> 41:30.918
I mean, what could be more poetically just,
me winning a computer?

41:55.746 --> 41:56.974
Clark.

41:58.315 --> 42:00.613
Hey, Lana. This is a great party.

42:00.784 --> 42:03.082
Your mom deserves a lot of the credit.

42:04.054 --> 42:05.419
Is Chloe okay?

42:06.423 --> 42:08.891
What happened to you really affected her.

42:12.629 --> 42:14.221
Me too.

42:16.666 --> 42:18.691
It was really hard seeing you sick.

42:18.902 --> 42:22.133
Guess I somehow always thought of you
as invincible.

42:22.806 --> 42:25.331
Now you think I'm just human.

42:26.510 --> 42:29.911
I guess that's my way of saying
that you mean a lot to me, Clark.

42:30.514 --> 42:32.880
And I know it's not that eloquent...

42:37.587 --> 42:41.079
...but I guess some people are just better
with words than others.
