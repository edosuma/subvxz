00:17.093 --> 00:18.386
Finally...

00:18.845 --> 00:21.973
the warring nations of Earth had
forgotten their differences...

00:22.473 --> 00:25.351
and banded together
to save our planet.

00:26.144 --> 00:29.981
The United Global Space Force
was searching the galaxy...

00:30.481 --> 00:33.776
for worlds rich with drinkable
water and breathable air.

00:34.318 --> 00:37.447
The hypergate was our best hope
to colonize space...

00:37.905 --> 00:38.865
our best hope for survival.

00:39.365 --> 00:41.075
But as we prepared
to launch ourselves...

00:41.576 --> 00:43.286
into the black of space...

00:43.744 --> 00:47.457
terrorists, calling themselves
'The Global Sedition...'

00:47.915 --> 00:49.750
were preparing to strike.

00:55.965 --> 00:58.926
Grissom base, this is Cargo 7
requesting landing clearance.

00:59.385 --> 01:00.928
Roger, transport.
This is Grissom gate control.

01:01.387 --> 01:02.138
Please download security codes.

01:02.638 --> 01:03.389
Downloading.

01:03.848 --> 01:06.350
Transport, I've got two blips
inside your radar signature.

01:06.809 --> 01:07.685
They're hiding in your shadow.

01:08.144 --> 01:09.312
I don't see anything.

01:14.483 --> 01:17.195
This is gate control.
Battle stations.

01:20.573 --> 01:21.490
Battle stations.

01:21.991 --> 01:24.202
Two Sedition fighters
are attacking the hypergate.

01:24.702 --> 01:25.745
Battle stations.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.830
Gate control, this is Eagle One.
I'm locked and loaded.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.707
Ready to fly.

01:30.208 --> 01:32.293
Roger, Eagle One.
You're clear to launch.

01:37.340 --> 01:39.008
Jeb, where are you, buddy?

01:40.593 --> 01:42.929
This cold war just got hot.

01:43.429 --> 01:44.263
They're Sedition raiders.

01:44.764 --> 01:47.224
It's another
mutant suicide squad.

01:48.643 --> 01:50.394
Here we go. Man-to-man.
Split them up.

01:50.895 --> 01:54.649
Last one to kill a bad guy
buys the beer.

01:58.069 --> 01:59.820
I'm gonna go through the gate,
get in front of him.

02:00.279 --> 02:02.698
That's not standard procedure,
Don.

02:06.243 --> 02:07.745
Better get inside his shields.

02:17.254 --> 02:18.506
You gen-techs are ugly up close.

02:19.006 --> 02:19.882
Target lock.

02:20.383 --> 02:21.509
Show time.

02:29.475 --> 02:31.227
Bogey One dispatched.

02:32.269 --> 02:34.980
Don, he's right on my tail.

02:35.439 --> 02:36.816
Damn! Can't shake him.

02:42.446 --> 02:43.406
I've been hit!

02:43.906 --> 02:45.032
Weapons are off-line.

02:45.950 --> 02:47.159
I'm gonna jettison
the main drive core.

02:47.660 --> 02:48.911
There you are.

02:56.252 --> 02:57.795
Am I good or what?

02:58.254 --> 03:00.506
Warning. Failure
in redundant drive systems.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.758
Gate control,
this is Ranger One.

03:03.259 --> 03:05.136
Engines will not respond.

03:06.095 --> 03:09.140
Don, I'm falling
towards the hypergate.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.726
Breaking thrusters won't fire!

03:12.393 --> 03:14.311
Impact in 30 seconds.

03:14.770 --> 03:15.730
Ranger One, this is base.

03:16.272 --> 03:18.190
Rescue craft
have been dispatched.

03:20.317 --> 03:23.320
Grissom, those pods will never
reach him in time.

03:23.821 --> 03:24.572
I'm going in.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.366
Major West, you are not
authorized to jeopardize--

03:27.867 --> 03:28.993
Never liked that station anyway.

03:29.493 --> 03:32.705
Warning. Proximity alert.

03:36.792 --> 03:37.543
Hang on, Jeb. I'm coming in.

03:38.002 --> 03:40.171
Abort. Abort!

03:40.713 --> 03:43.257
I'll give you a little kiss.
Don't take this the wrong way.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.010
Impact in five seconds.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.030
Does this mean
we're going steady?

04:06.489 --> 04:09.366
You're not getting out
of buying those beers that easy.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.966
With intrepid pioneering spirit,
the Robinson family...

04:26.425 --> 04:28.844
will journey to the distant
world of Alpha Prime.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.972
What kind of future can
our children look forward to?

04:32.431 --> 04:34.099
A future in paradise.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.559
The Jupiter mission...

04:36.018 --> 04:39.146
made possible by the Army and
Silicon Graphics Corporation.

04:39.605 --> 04:43.609
S.G.I. Saving the future
for our children.

04:44.109 --> 04:45.694
Give me a break.

04:46.195 --> 04:47.863
Holo-call
from Houston middle school.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.156
Hello?

04:49.657 --> 04:50.908
Hello, Principal Cartwright.

04:51.408 --> 04:53.160
What has he done this time?

04:53.619 --> 04:58.082
He hacked our main power grid
to run his experiment.

04:58.958 --> 05:00.501
The school was in chaos.

05:01.293 --> 05:02.253
Yeah, right.

05:02.753 --> 05:04.630
We didn't even have lights.

05:08.467 --> 05:11.804
This is no laughing matter,
Professor Robinson.

05:12.262 --> 05:15.307
Will is terribly gifted.

05:15.766 --> 05:18.018
The changing shape of education.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.063
His little time machines,
though pure fancy...

05:21.563 --> 05:24.441
are the products
of a truly brilliant mind.

05:26.276 --> 05:27.820
No more monkey business.

05:28.278 --> 05:29.571
I mean it.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.157
The boy is starved
for attention.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.577
I know your life is anything
but normal right now...

05:36.036 --> 05:37.371
but wasn't there some way...

05:37.871 --> 05:40.874
his father could have
attended the science fair?

05:41.375 --> 05:42.918
As you are aware...

05:43.419 --> 05:45.879
Alpha Prime is the only other
habitable planet...

05:46.338 --> 05:50.134
yet detected
by deep space recon.

05:51.051 --> 05:54.179
My crew will sleep away
our 10-yearjourney there...

05:54.680 --> 05:56.390
in suspended animation.

05:57.349 --> 06:00.394
Once we have rendezvoused with
the research colony on Alpha...

06:00.853 --> 06:03.063
I will supervise
construction of a hypergate.

06:03.522 --> 06:06.233
By then,
technicians here on Earth...

06:06.734 --> 06:09.695
will have completed
the companion hypergate...

06:10.195 --> 06:12.281
in our planet's orbit.

06:13.824 --> 06:15.534
Once both gates are complete...

06:16.368 --> 06:20.789
ships will be able to pass
instantaneously between them.

06:21.248 --> 06:24.752
Immediate colonization
of Alpha Prime will be possible.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.796
Can't you just use
the Jupiter's hyper-engine...

06:28.297 --> 06:30.257
to zap straight to Alpha Prime?

06:30.966 --> 06:33.343
Hyperspace exists
beneath normal space.

06:33.844 --> 06:37.347
If you try to enter hyperspace
without a gate...

06:38.265 --> 06:39.600
your exit factor is random.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.685
There's no telling
where you'd come out.

06:42.394 --> 06:45.147
Ninety-eight percent of
the galaxy is still uncharted.

06:45.647 --> 06:48.400
There's a lot of space
to get lost in.

06:50.652 --> 06:52.863
How is Captain Daniels
recovering from the flu?

06:53.322 --> 06:54.740
Will he pilot the mission?

06:55.240 --> 06:56.783
Ladies and gentlemen.

06:57.242 --> 07:01.079
You came to get your first look
at the Jupiter 1.

07:01.538 --> 07:03.207
Don't you think
you've waited long enough?

07:04.291 --> 07:05.792
Let's move into the launch dome.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.127
One more question, Professor.

07:07.586 --> 07:09.838
Now that the mission's
been pushed up...

07:10.339 --> 07:12.841
how do your children feel
about leaving the earth behind?

07:13.342 --> 07:16.011
They couldn't be more excited.

07:17.179 --> 07:18.889
This mission sucks!

07:19.389 --> 07:21.266
I don't wanna leave early.
I don't wanna go at all.

07:21.725 --> 07:23.101
We will discuss this at dinner.

07:24.102 --> 07:27.147
For the last three years, I've
missed everything training...

07:27.606 --> 07:30.359
so I can spend the next 10 years
missing everything else.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.195
I'm not staying home for dinner.

07:33.654 --> 07:34.905
I'm seeing my friends.

07:35.364 --> 07:36.698
Penny.

07:37.199 --> 07:40.786
I'm going out to say good-bye
to my entire life.

07:41.620 --> 07:44.581
Penny, I need you here tonight.
Wait a minute.

07:51.713 --> 07:55.384
On this eve, before she's torn
from everything she knows--

07:55.842 --> 07:57.344
kidnapped...

07:57.844 --> 08:00.722
hurled into deep space
against her will--

08:01.181 --> 08:03.767
what thoughts fill the mind
of the daring space captive?

08:04.226 --> 08:05.727
Are there boys on Alpha Prime?

08:06.186 --> 08:07.854
What will I wear?

08:11.024 --> 08:14.611
What will it be like to jettison
your body into deep space?

08:16.238 --> 08:19.366
First...
you'll try holding your breath.

08:19.866 --> 08:22.786
But your blood's
already begun to boil.

08:23.245 --> 08:27.582
Then your skin inflates
like a balloon.

08:28.083 --> 08:30.127
Then...pop.

08:30.627 --> 08:32.421
Do they have a name
for what's wrong with you?

08:36.216 --> 08:37.676
Dad says don't bring them.

08:38.176 --> 08:39.970
Like anything I do
matters to him.

08:40.470 --> 08:42.304
Don't sweat it, kid.

08:42.806 --> 08:46.309
I got apology videos
for two birthdays.

08:46.810 --> 08:49.229
He forgot last year completely.

08:50.313 --> 08:52.941
This mission's the only thing
he cares about anymore.

08:59.448 --> 09:00.741
So that's a no to family dinner?

09:01.241 --> 09:02.826
Let's see.

09:03.326 --> 09:04.828
Do I spend my last night
on Earth...

09:05.287 --> 09:08.331
watching Mom and Dad pretend
not to be fighting again...

09:08.832 --> 09:11.710
or blow 10 years worth
of allowance at the mall?

09:13.420 --> 09:14.379
You do the math.

09:14.838 --> 09:16.131
Mom's gonna go thermal.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.092
What's she gonna do,
ground me?

09:20.677 --> 09:23.096
I'm nervous about jamming in
a new pilot the last second.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.931
The Global Sedition
is getting brave.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.100
First the hypergate,
then Daniels.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.561
Next time, they may attack
the launch dome.

09:30.061 --> 09:31.021
We can't afford to wait.

09:31.480 --> 09:35.066
Will's science fair. Reminder.
Apology video for Will.

09:35.525 --> 09:36.359
He'll understand.

09:36.860 --> 09:37.819
Ben, listen.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.198
My family is on this mission.

09:41.656 --> 09:43.658
I need a pilot who's
more than just spit and polish.

09:44.159 --> 09:45.494
I've got your man.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.662
He just doesn't know it yet.

09:53.251 --> 09:53.752
At ease, Major.

09:54.211 --> 09:55.754
Why was I pulled
from active duty?

09:56.254 --> 09:57.672
Those gen-techs
may attack again.

09:58.757 --> 09:59.508
I need to be up there.

10:00.008 --> 10:01.176
Do you know Professor Robinson?

10:01.635 --> 10:04.763
By reputation. Your father's
battle strategies...

10:05.263 --> 10:07.224
were required reading
at the academy.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.519
What can you tell me
about the Jupiter mission?

10:12.145 --> 10:13.855
The Jupiter
is an oversized robot.

10:14.773 --> 10:16.149
Everything's automatic.

10:17.859 --> 10:18.944
Any monkey in a flight suit...

10:19.444 --> 10:21.112
can pilot that ship
out of the solar system...

10:21.571 --> 10:23.323
and set her down on Alpha Prime.

10:23.782 --> 10:26.284
It's a baby-sitting job, sir.

10:26.743 --> 10:27.744
No offence.

10:28.203 --> 10:31.873
Major, are you aware Earth's
resources are severely limited?

10:32.374 --> 10:33.250
Every schoolchild knows...

10:33.708 --> 10:36.545
that our recycling technologies
will cure the environment.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.256
Sending a family
across the galaxy...

10:39.756 --> 10:42.759
is a stunt to sell computers
to people of all ages.

10:43.218 --> 10:44.511
Every schoolchild was lied to.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.264
Recycling technologies
came too late.

10:47.764 --> 10:50.433
All fossil fuels
are virtually exhausted.

10:50.892 --> 10:52.978
The ozone layer is down to 40%.

10:53.478 --> 10:59.150
In two decades, the earth will
be unable to support human life.

10:59.609 --> 11:02.529
The new Global Sedition knows
the truth as well as we do.

11:02.988 --> 11:04.531
They're building
their own hypergate.

11:04.990 --> 11:07.534
They hope to colonize
Alpha Prime first.

11:08.034 --> 11:09.327
If they're successful...

11:09.786 --> 11:11.871
western demons like you and I,
Major West...

11:12.372 --> 11:13.915
will be left on Earth to die.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.376
Captain Daniels doesn't have
the flu, does he?

11:16.876 --> 11:19.963
Captain Daniels was murdered
in his apartment last night.

11:20.422 --> 11:22.090
The flu story is a cover.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.801
I flew with Mike.

11:25.427 --> 11:28.013
We should blast their bases!
A decisive strike now!

11:28.513 --> 11:29.597
My squadron is alert status--

11:30.140 --> 11:31.933
Your rescue stunt was fool hardy!

11:32.434 --> 11:33.852
I had a friend in trouble.

11:36.771 --> 11:39.190
disobeyed a direct order
because of a friend?

11:40.942 --> 11:42.068
I did...

11:43.153 --> 11:44.321
sir.

11:46.781 --> 11:47.949
He'll do.

11:52.662 --> 11:53.830
Congratulations.

11:54.330 --> 11:56.791
You're the new pilot
of the Jupiter mission.

11:59.711 --> 12:02.756
Where's my money?

12:07.385 --> 12:09.387
The Sedition hired me
to provide access...

12:09.846 --> 12:11.890
to Daniels' apartment
and no more.

12:12.348 --> 12:14.517
My work is done.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.270
They found a replacement pilot.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.564
Our attack
on the hypergate failed.

12:20.023 --> 12:21.900
How tragic for you.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.905
We require a more direct
intervention on your part.

12:27.363 --> 12:28.698
I see.

12:31.242 --> 12:33.161
It will cost you.

12:34.788 --> 12:38.374
I'm afraid that my price
has just become...

12:38.833 --> 12:40.418
astronomical.

12:42.045 --> 12:43.213
Holograph off.

12:52.764 --> 12:53.932
Come in.

12:59.103 --> 13:02.398
Control hasn't received
results of the pre-flight exams.

13:02.899 --> 13:05.568
The Robinsons
have checked out 100%.

13:08.905 --> 13:11.491
They're fit as a fiddle
and ready to fly.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.159
Wish them luck...

13:14.244 --> 13:15.495
for me.

13:22.043 --> 13:25.213
Mission protocols are simple.
Robinson is in command...

13:25.213 --> 13:26.381
unless you encounter
a military emergency.

13:26.881 --> 13:28.675
In that case, Major West,
you are in charge.

13:29.133 --> 13:31.594
I'm a fighter pilot.
There must be better candidates.

13:32.095 --> 13:34.055
Hell, even my own family
can't stand me.

13:34.556 --> 13:35.974
Shut up.

13:38.768 --> 13:41.062
Jeb Walker.
He's an excellent flyer.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.564
He's perfect for this mission.

13:43.064 --> 13:44.357
Welcome aboard, Major.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.544
Looks like somebody sprung
for the full-extras package...

14:05.044 --> 14:05.753
on this beauty.

14:06.254 --> 14:10.049
If you have to be a baby-sitter,
it's not such a bad nursery.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.135
Wouldn't you agree?

14:13.845 --> 14:14.596
I don't get it.

14:15.096 --> 14:17.724
I can't get the cryo-sleep
systems up over96%.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.767
Dr Smith approved the specs.

14:20.226 --> 14:23.730
Dr Smith is the base physician.
I am responsible in flight.

14:24.272 --> 14:26.065
These tubes will be perfect,
or the ship will not launch.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.317
Is that clear?

14:27.775 --> 14:29.944
Absolutely, Doctor.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.990
Judy, I want to introduce you
to Major West.

14:34.490 --> 14:36.284
He'll be taking Mike's place.

14:38.953 --> 14:41.372
He's heavier than Mike.
We'll have to recalibrate.

14:41.998 --> 14:44.625
I'd be happy to discuss
my dimensions, Doctor...

14:45.084 --> 14:46.377
say, over dinner?

14:47.420 --> 14:48.963
West.
I've read about you.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.798
You're a war hero, aren't you?

14:51.257 --> 14:53.801
Well, yes, actually.

14:54.510 --> 14:58.181
Who was it who said,
'Those who can't think, fight'?

14:59.265 --> 15:01.351
I think that it was me.

15:01.809 --> 15:03.561
It was nice to have met you.

15:08.399 --> 15:11.444
That's one cold fish
I'd love to thaw.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.782
I'm not gonna make it over
for dinner tonight, Dad.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.543
It's gonna be a long flight.

15:29.837 --> 15:31.506
Maureen, pick up the phone,
honey.

15:32.006 --> 15:33.132
I know you're there.
Are you still packing?

15:33.591 --> 15:35.093
I'm just leaving.
Go to bed.

15:47.647 --> 15:48.815
Sweetie?

15:56.906 --> 15:58.199
He won first prize again.

15:58.699 --> 16:01.119
Is this the new model
he's been working on?

16:06.249 --> 16:08.292
Crazy idea he's got about a...

16:09.293 --> 16:11.212
time machine?

16:13.631 --> 16:16.175
Pretty sharp stuff for a midget.

16:17.635 --> 16:19.345
Sorry about dinner.
That new pilot--

16:19.846 --> 16:20.763
John, the family needs you here.

16:21.264 --> 16:24.058
This whole thing
is about family.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.352
My only condition
for accepting this mission...

16:26.853 --> 16:29.522
was that we could bring
the children with us...

16:29.981 --> 16:30.773
not leave them behind...

16:31.274 --> 16:33.484
so future generations
would have a new home.

16:33.943 --> 16:36.445
You're off saving humanity,
so what does it matter...

16:36.904 --> 16:38.739
that Will
has to blackout his school...

16:39.240 --> 16:40.783
to get his father's attention...

16:41.242 --> 16:44.912
Penny's been dragged home
by security 3 nights in a row...

16:45.413 --> 16:47.164
Judy's become a ghost,
like her father?

16:47.623 --> 16:49.250
I have to compensate
for the new launch time.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.085
What do you think I'm doing?

16:51.544 --> 16:52.587
Revising life-science protocols.

16:53.087 --> 16:54.630
I'm also dealing
with two kids...

16:55.131 --> 16:57.133
who are leaving
an entire planet behind.

16:57.633 --> 17:01.345
Sorry, but there's no manuals
on how to deal with this.

17:04.973 --> 17:06.976
Maybe it doesn't do any good...

17:10.271 --> 17:13.983
saving a world of families
if we can't save our own.

17:17.236 --> 17:18.570
Is that it, Professor?

17:23.492 --> 17:24.160
John.

17:24.618 --> 17:26.787
I know, baby.
I'm scared, too.

17:57.026 --> 17:58.110
Med supplies for the Jupiter 2?

17:58.110 --> 17:59.153
That's our last crate.

17:59.653 --> 18:00.529
What a mess.

18:00.988 --> 18:02.323
They're not taking any chances.

18:51.455 --> 18:54.834
Forgive me if I forego the kiss,
my sleeping behemoth...

18:55.292 --> 18:57.753
but the time has come to awake.

18:58.254 --> 18:59.713
Robot is on-line.

19:00.214 --> 19:01.882
Reviewing primary directives.

19:02.341 --> 19:05.386
One--
preserve the Robinson family.

19:05.886 --> 19:07.638
Two--
maintain the ship's systems.

19:08.139 --> 19:11.809
Spare me the chatter,
my steely centurion.

19:12.309 --> 19:16.856
Sadly, I fear I have far more
dire deeds in store for you.

19:17.940 --> 19:19.400
Robot is on-line.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.360
Reviewing primary directives.

19:21.819 --> 19:24.822
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinson family.

19:25.281 --> 19:27.533
Destroy all systems.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.869
That's more like it.

19:30.369 --> 19:32.705
Farewell,
my platinum-plated pal.

19:35.416 --> 19:37.626
Give my regards to oblivion.

19:46.260 --> 19:50.306
Apparently you have completed
your mission on schedule.

19:50.764 --> 19:54.184
I do so admire a spot
of timely terrorism.

19:54.643 --> 19:57.146
I thought I told you
never to call me here.

19:57.605 --> 20:00.107
The transmission signal
could be traced.

20:00.608 --> 20:04.153
I just wanted to express
my most sincere gratitude...

20:04.612 --> 20:07.823
for your unflagging loyalty.

20:08.282 --> 20:10.326
Good work, good doctor...

20:10.826 --> 20:12.578
and good-bye.

20:28.552 --> 20:31.889
Jupiter 1 launch
in three minutes.

20:32.348 --> 20:33.432
Mom, just--

20:33.932 --> 20:34.642
Shoot.

20:35.100 --> 20:35.851
Mom, I'm fine.

20:36.352 --> 20:37.770
That's supposed to be there.

20:38.854 --> 20:41.148
This is almost acceptable.

20:42.191 --> 20:43.776
-Mom, don't.
-What?

20:44.234 --> 20:46.278
Vogue says this will be
the style in 10 years.

20:46.779 --> 20:47.738
Can we cut back on her oxygen...

20:48.238 --> 20:50.616
so she's not so annoying
when she wakes up?

20:51.116 --> 20:51.992
Does he have to wake up at all?

20:52.493 --> 20:54.828
That's it. I'm gonna turn
this spaceship around.

20:55.329 --> 20:58.791
Satellite defence net locked
and A-OK.

21:24.233 --> 21:26.735
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-30 seconds. Mark.

21:27.194 --> 21:29.321
-Hey there, buddy.
-Com-links encoded and secure.

21:29.780 --> 21:31.490
-Good night, guys.
-Good night.

21:31.949 --> 21:33.117
Here we go.

21:33.617 --> 21:35.869
Artificial gravity at 100%.

21:36.328 --> 21:37.871
You get a 'C'
in paternal expression...

21:38.372 --> 21:40.290
but an 'A' for effort.

21:40.749 --> 21:43.168
-I'm doing the best I can.
-Come here.

21:47.589 --> 21:49.174
You always get an 'A' in this.

21:49.633 --> 21:51.718
Main drive systems on-line.

21:52.219 --> 21:53.595
Sweet dreams.

21:54.054 --> 21:55.222
See you there.

21:56.640 --> 22:00.561
You are at 'T' minus one minute
and counting, Major West.

22:09.611 --> 22:11.321
Houston, the bird is hot.

22:14.283 --> 22:15.409
She's all yours.

22:16.994 --> 22:19.663
I'll try to give you
a smooth ride.

22:25.627 --> 22:27.546
Mission control,
this is Dr Robinson.

22:28.005 --> 22:29.006
We are in the green.

22:29.464 --> 22:32.968
Roger, Doctor. You are go
to initiate cryo-stasis.

22:36.513 --> 22:37.764
One question.

22:39.224 --> 22:41.935
Is there room
in these tubes for two?

22:43.270 --> 22:45.731
There's barely enough
for you and your ego.

22:47.441 --> 22:48.734
Don't sweat it, doc.

22:49.234 --> 22:50.736
I do this all the time.

22:51.194 --> 22:52.738
Just drive carefully.

22:55.032 --> 22:57.576
You are at 'T' minus 40 seconds
and counting.

22:58.076 --> 22:59.244
Ready.

23:09.046 --> 23:12.382
You are at 'T' minus
30 seconds and counting.

23:25.854 --> 23:28.315
You are at 'T' minus
20 seconds and counting.

23:28.815 --> 23:30.150
Control, this is Jupiter 1.

23:30.651 --> 23:31.944
The Robinsons are all tucked in.

23:32.402 --> 23:33.278
We are ready to fly.

23:33.779 --> 23:37.366
Major West, your escape vector
is clear of all traffic.

23:37.824 --> 23:39.868
Op is go on your command.

23:40.369 --> 23:41.536
Roger, Houston.

23:41.995 --> 23:44.414
And the monkey flips the switch.

24:18.198 --> 24:21.159
Jupiter 1 booster disengaged.

24:28.959 --> 24:30.377
This is Jupiter 2.

24:30.877 --> 24:34.214
Diverting all spacecraft control
to the main computer.

24:36.383 --> 24:38.301
Eight years of flight training.

24:40.846 --> 24:43.390
Navigational holographics
on-line.

24:43.807 --> 24:45.350
Fifty combat missions.

24:47.727 --> 24:50.772
Course confirmed for slingshot
exit of the solar system.

24:53.275 --> 24:57.195
So I can take the family camper
on an interstellar picnic.

25:00.157 --> 25:02.784
Ten years is a lifetime.

25:04.244 --> 25:05.912
Sleep well, old friend.

25:07.831 --> 25:10.417
I never liked
these freezing tubes.

25:14.004 --> 25:15.172
Bad dreams.

25:23.388 --> 25:26.725
Navigational interface
confirmed.

25:27.225 --> 25:30.145
Cryo-sleep systems at 100%.

26:10.310 --> 26:11.519
Shit!

26:16.816 --> 26:18.568
Robot is on-line.

26:19.110 --> 26:21.947
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinson family.

26:22.447 --> 26:23.990
Destroy all systems.

26:24.449 --> 26:26.826
Disable program!

26:27.285 --> 26:29.829
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinson family.

26:30.330 --> 26:32.165
Destroy all systems.

26:32.707 --> 26:34.626
Robot is on-line.

26:35.085 --> 26:36.252
Destroy.

26:40.882 --> 26:43.593
Destroy all operating systems.

26:44.094 --> 26:46.221
Destroy Jupiter 2.

26:50.183 --> 26:52.769
Destroy all operating systems.

26:53.269 --> 26:54.813
Destroy Jupiter 2.

26:55.313 --> 26:58.149
Destroy cryo-sleep systems.

27:03.279 --> 27:04.656
Destroy.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.708
Destroy navigational systems.

27:17.293 --> 27:19.879
Come on!
Wake up, damn you!

27:22.298 --> 27:25.427
I can't stop this infernal
contraption on my own.

27:30.348 --> 27:33.935
Emergency cryo-stasis
desequencing in process.

27:34.477 --> 27:36.771
Destroy all systems.

27:37.272 --> 27:38.148
Destroy Robinson family.

27:38.648 --> 27:40.275
Maureen, the children!

27:40.734 --> 27:41.901
Destroy.

27:43.027 --> 27:44.154
Run!

27:45.155 --> 27:47.449
-Destroy.
-Deactivate safety.

27:52.287 --> 27:54.873
That was a mistake.

28:04.299 --> 28:05.884
Dad!

28:09.304 --> 28:10.805
Mom, let's go!

28:11.514 --> 28:15.268
-Will, stop!
-Destroy.

28:33.203 --> 28:34.704
Destroy Jupiter 2.

28:38.333 --> 28:40.919
Destroy Robinson family.

28:54.724 --> 28:56.517
Look away, baby.

28:58.102 --> 29:00.230
Robot, disable pulse blaster.

29:00.730 --> 29:01.439
Command accepted.

29:01.898 --> 29:04.067
Cancel attack sequence
and stand by.

29:07.362 --> 29:09.781
If the family won't come
to the science fair...

29:10.240 --> 29:12.742
bring the science fair
to the family.

29:14.577 --> 29:15.745
Showoff.

29:16.871 --> 29:17.914
Robot.

29:18.414 --> 29:19.874
On-line. Standing by.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.835
Return to docking bay
and power down.

29:23.378 --> 29:24.671
Major, you all right?

29:25.171 --> 29:27.966
Next picnic, no robots.

29:29.259 --> 29:30.593
Where's Judy?

29:34.347 --> 29:36.766
Stabilize the operating systems.

29:37.266 --> 29:38.101
Fire control.

29:38.559 --> 29:41.187
Attempting
containment protocols.

29:42.438 --> 29:44.232
I want to go home now.

29:44.857 --> 29:46.901
Navigation's down.
System shorts everywhere.

29:47.402 --> 29:49.487
Damn.
Communications are out.

29:49.988 --> 29:51.656
Link up the secondary system.

29:52.115 --> 29:54.242
-Shunting power from reserve.
-Come on.

29:54.742 --> 29:55.493
Try it now.

29:56.035 --> 29:57.412
Navigational boards are lit.

29:58.538 --> 29:59.956
Can we reroute?

30:00.456 --> 30:02.125
I'm locked out of the helm.

30:02.542 --> 30:03.918
Nothing in computer control.

30:04.377 --> 30:05.503
Main com to manual.

30:05.962 --> 30:07.547
See if she'll respond.

30:08.006 --> 30:11.342
The main subroutine won't open.
I'm gonna try remote ops.

30:14.012 --> 30:14.721
Smith!

30:15.221 --> 30:17.265
Get back!
Get away from me!

30:17.724 --> 30:20.268
What the hell
are you doing here?

30:20.768 --> 30:23.813
Major West,
thank God it's you.

30:24.272 --> 30:26.357
I was in here
doing some last minute checks.

30:26.816 --> 30:27.608
Someone hit me from behind.

30:28.067 --> 30:29.777
That's Sedition technology.

30:30.778 --> 30:31.821
You're a damn spy.

30:32.280 --> 30:33.448
You did this.

30:35.825 --> 30:36.743
What are you doing?

30:37.201 --> 30:37.910
Throwing out the trash!

30:38.411 --> 30:39.829
I need help!

30:40.830 --> 30:43.249
I can't get Judy out!
She's dying!

30:47.670 --> 30:49.380
Touch me,
and the girl dies!

30:49.881 --> 30:51.549
I don't deal with dead men.

30:52.049 --> 30:53.509
Kill me, kill the girl.

30:55.219 --> 30:56.554
How much is your revenge worth?

30:57.054 --> 30:58.598
I can save her life...

30:59.140 --> 31:02.602
only if you give me your word
as an officer you'll spare mine.

31:05.354 --> 31:08.649
-Help her.
-I've got helm control.

31:18.326 --> 31:20.369
We're way off course.

31:23.623 --> 31:25.625
We're caught in the sun's
gravitational pull.

31:26.125 --> 31:27.710
Is that what that big ball is?

31:31.422 --> 31:34.884
We've got four minutes before
the outer hull begins to melt.

31:35.343 --> 31:37.929
I need you to check
on the thruster alignments.

31:38.429 --> 31:39.847
Professor!

31:40.306 --> 31:42.308
I'll try for the Mercury mines.

31:43.684 --> 31:45.353
I'll need Dr Robinson's
portable gurney.

31:45.811 --> 31:46.729
You'll find it below.

31:47.230 --> 31:49.232
Smith, come on!

31:52.276 --> 31:54.153
You tried to kill my family.

31:54.612 --> 31:55.404
We trusted you.

31:55.905 --> 31:57.990
It's the world behind the world,
Professor Robinson.

31:58.491 --> 32:01.827
Lie once, cheat twice,
and everything becomes clear.

32:02.286 --> 32:06.666
Do not mistake my deception
for a character flaw.

32:07.166 --> 32:08.000
It is a philosophical choice...

32:08.459 --> 32:11.003
that I've found
in a study of the universe.

32:11.504 --> 32:12.505
It is a way of life.

32:12.922 --> 32:13.965
You're a monster.

32:14.507 --> 32:16.717
Perhaps,
but I'm also the only one...

32:17.218 --> 32:19.095
who can save Judy's life.

32:20.638 --> 32:23.099
Penny, precious, I want you to
short the power on my command.

32:23.557 --> 32:25.309
Does he have to call me
precious?

32:27.770 --> 32:29.146
Penny, precious.

32:30.439 --> 32:32.024
Now!

32:37.405 --> 32:38.823
She's not breathing.

32:39.282 --> 32:40.783
Sick bay, move!

32:41.284 --> 32:42.243
The sun won't let us go.

32:42.702 --> 32:44.161
Heat shield breach,
60 seconds.

32:44.662 --> 32:45.371
I need options, Professor.

32:45.830 --> 32:47.873
We have to divert all power
to the engines.

32:48.582 --> 32:50.167
I'm rerouting life sciences.

32:50.668 --> 32:52.461
Rerouting life support.

32:52.962 --> 32:54.839
Engines at80%.

32:56.674 --> 32:59.552
There's no cardiopulmonary
or respiratory functions.

33:09.186 --> 33:10.479
Clear.

33:11.981 --> 33:13.566
Again. Clear.

33:20.865 --> 33:21.741
Alert.

33:22.241 --> 33:23.367
Medical.

33:24.785 --> 33:25.536
Rerouting error.

33:26.037 --> 33:27.496
Systems are crashing.

33:31.375 --> 33:33.252
We're losing her. Do something.

33:44.138 --> 33:45.306
Come on, child.

33:47.349 --> 33:49.435
Put a little heart into it.

33:50.644 --> 33:52.104
The other life I save...

33:53.397 --> 33:55.191
will be my own.

33:56.358 --> 33:59.653
Wake up, baby, please.

34:01.864 --> 34:03.657
That's all the power we've got.

34:04.158 --> 34:06.160
I'm putting the pedal
to the metal. Here it goes.

34:21.675 --> 34:24.844
She can't break free.
She doesn't have enough thrust.

34:25.304 --> 34:28.098
There's got to be a way
to get through this.

34:29.183 --> 34:30.309
That's it.

34:35.105 --> 34:35.813
It's working!

34:36.273 --> 34:37.525
What is?

34:38.067 --> 34:40.360
If we can't go around the sun,
we go straight through it...

34:40.860 --> 34:41.654
using your hyperdrive.

34:42.196 --> 34:43.947
Engage the hyperdrive
without a gate?

34:44.406 --> 34:46.449
We could be thrown
anywhere in the galaxy.

34:46.951 --> 34:48.118
Anywhere but here.

34:54.083 --> 34:56.293
On my mark.

35:01.090 --> 35:03.884
Three, two, one, initiate.

35:27.783 --> 35:30.244
Hyperdrive at 100%.

35:31.537 --> 35:34.540
Major, you have the com.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.294
Dad? Dad!

35:40.462 --> 35:42.423
Let's see what this baby can do.

36:18.125 --> 36:20.586
Maureen, everyone?

36:22.671 --> 36:23.756
-Where is Judy?
-She's OK.

36:24.214 --> 36:27.092
She is, thanks to me.

36:28.135 --> 36:29.470
Here I am.

36:29.928 --> 36:31.764
Either I should cut down
on the liquids...

36:32.222 --> 36:34.516
or I should sew in a new flap
because it was really hell...

36:35.017 --> 36:35.934
getting out of that thing.

36:36.393 --> 36:37.186
You're...

36:37.644 --> 36:39.772
Vitals are normal. Pulse
and respiration seem to be.

36:40.314 --> 36:41.815
-Are you OK?
-I'm fine.

36:42.357 --> 36:43.442
Come here.

36:44.651 --> 36:48.405
Will every little problem be an
excuse for familial sentiment?

36:52.618 --> 36:53.744
How much, Smith?

36:55.162 --> 36:59.166
What was the price tag
that you put on our future?

37:14.890 --> 37:17.226
You can't do it, can you, John?

37:17.726 --> 37:21.980
You can't kill the man
without becoming the monster.

37:31.365 --> 37:32.574
Coward.

37:40.624 --> 37:43.460
What's happened, John?
Where are we?

37:50.300 --> 37:52.177
I bypassed
most of the damaged systems.

37:52.678 --> 37:54.513
We'll have to repair the rest
manually.

37:56.807 --> 37:57.975
You had me worried, doc.

37:58.475 --> 37:59.935
Nice to see you thawed.

38:00.435 --> 38:02.980
You have a puzzling definition
of a smooth ride.

38:03.438 --> 38:07.568
Computer,
map our current position.

38:09.069 --> 38:12.614
Searching
for recognizable constellations.

38:15.701 --> 38:19.621
This database has star maps
of all the known galaxy.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.583
I don't recognize
a single system.

38:25.294 --> 38:26.878
We're lost....

38:28.213 --> 38:29.423
aren't we?

38:45.689 --> 38:46.648
Easy, doc. God.

38:47.107 --> 38:47.858
Please.

38:48.358 --> 38:51.069
The cryosuit absorbed
most of the electrical charge.

38:51.611 --> 38:53.905
You're lucky
this wasn't your hide.

38:54.364 --> 38:58.160
Doctor, is that concern
I detect in your voice?

39:00.245 --> 39:02.497
Great bedside manner.

39:05.292 --> 39:06.501
What's that?

39:06.960 --> 39:08.545
A battle scar?

39:09.921 --> 39:11.006
Sort of.

39:12.049 --> 39:13.383
It was a tattoo.

39:13.842 --> 39:17.554
An ex-girl friend's name,
but I had it removed.

39:18.055 --> 39:20.182
Wouldn't it be easier
to use a magic marker?

39:22.142 --> 39:23.894
Yeah, well, that's me.

39:24.394 --> 39:26.438
A girl in every port.

39:26.938 --> 39:28.106
So, Major, no family?

39:28.607 --> 39:31.151
Nothing to tie you down,
no one to miss?

39:31.651 --> 39:34.905
I've never been
the fit-in and play-nice type.

39:37.407 --> 39:38.950
You think that's romantic?

39:41.745 --> 39:42.871
I don't.

39:44.289 --> 39:46.208
But what about you, doc?

39:46.666 --> 39:49.294
Is there some lucky little nerd
you left behind?

39:50.462 --> 39:52.672
I spent three years working
on this mission.

39:53.131 --> 39:54.800
We're trying to save the planet.

39:55.300 --> 39:57.052
I haven't had time for fun.

39:57.511 --> 40:00.305
If there's no time for fun...

40:00.764 --> 40:03.183
then what are we saving
the planet for?

40:14.778 --> 40:15.570
Here.

40:16.113 --> 40:16.780
Thanks.

40:17.239 --> 40:18.782
I hate being little.

40:25.413 --> 40:27.374
I think it broke.

40:29.876 --> 40:30.794
I'll try and fix it.

40:31.294 --> 40:33.463
Why aren't you up on deck
with Mom and Dad?

40:33.922 --> 40:34.881
Have you met our parents?

40:35.382 --> 40:36.550
Good point.

40:38.593 --> 40:39.803
Popcorn, orchids...

40:40.262 --> 40:42.848
waves, Billy...

40:43.306 --> 40:44.975
kissing.

40:46.935 --> 40:48.144
Chocolate.

40:49.187 --> 40:50.814
It's a list...

40:53.024 --> 40:54.526
of everything we left behind.

40:59.656 --> 41:01.157
Never love anything, kid do...

41:02.534 --> 41:04.578
'cause you just end up
losing it.

41:14.921 --> 41:17.173
Smith could still hurt us.

41:19.301 --> 41:21.344
Maybe I shouldn't let him live.

41:27.559 --> 41:28.268
But...

41:28.727 --> 41:30.895
How can we bring
civilization to the stars...

41:31.354 --> 41:33.273
if we can't remain civilized?
Right, Professor?

41:33.773 --> 41:36.776
Have you noticed that you
take the opposite position...

41:37.277 --> 41:38.695
to whatever I say?

41:39.154 --> 41:40.238
Of course I do.

41:40.697 --> 41:42.449
We're married.

41:44.909 --> 41:45.702
Alert.

41:46.161 --> 41:48.663
Spatial anomaly in progress.

41:49.122 --> 41:51.249
What the hell?

41:59.716 --> 42:02.427
I must be dreaming.
That looks like a ship.

42:02.427 --> 42:05.555
It appears to be some sort
of hole in space.

42:06.097 --> 42:07.724
Where does it lead?

42:08.224 --> 42:09.934
A reasonable question.

42:14.022 --> 42:15.523
Major, wait.

42:16.024 --> 42:17.192
I'll wait later.

42:24.240 --> 42:25.033
Pull back.

42:25.492 --> 42:27.243
Let there be light.

42:56.064 --> 42:57.148
Proteus?

42:58.691 --> 43:00.693
She's one of ours, all right.

43:04.280 --> 43:05.448
All right.

43:07.117 --> 43:08.993
I've never seen a ship
like this.

43:12.455 --> 43:14.749
No response to hails.

43:15.208 --> 43:18.545
Scanning all military
and civilian frequencies.

43:19.045 --> 43:19.754
Nothing.

43:20.213 --> 43:22.715
I'm getting
inconsistent life signs...

43:23.216 --> 43:25.593
but they may be sensor ghosts.

43:27.887 --> 43:29.430
Computer is still on.

43:31.057 --> 43:33.184
I'll try the standard
docking codes.

43:33.726 --> 43:35.353
Control codes confirmed.

43:35.854 --> 43:37.397
Initiating docking sequence.

43:42.235 --> 43:44.821
Weird.
What kind of ship is that?

43:45.238 --> 43:47.157
That's not one of ours.

43:58.710 --> 44:02.171
Boys, that's not even human.

44:03.840 --> 44:05.049
If this is all a dream...

44:05.550 --> 44:07.677
why can't there be more girls?

44:13.975 --> 44:15.768
As part of her enslavement...

44:16.227 --> 44:19.147
the brave young space captive
Penny Robinson...

44:19.647 --> 44:26.279
is forced to utilize her
dazzling technical expertise.

44:35.163 --> 44:35.872
Identify yourself, soldier.

44:36.331 --> 44:39.709
West, Major,
United Global Space Force...

44:40.168 --> 44:42.587
requesting permission
to see the prisoner.

44:46.633 --> 44:51.220
Proceed, Major West.

45:02.023 --> 45:04.317
Could he be cuter?

45:06.402 --> 45:07.612
I don't think so.

45:08.112 --> 45:10.031
Breathe, Penny.

45:14.327 --> 45:15.495
Unlock.

45:25.129 --> 45:26.422
These quarters are unacceptable.

45:26.923 --> 45:29.384
We're going to check out
the probe ship.

45:29.884 --> 45:32.387
Maybe we can figure out how they
got here and how to get home.

45:32.887 --> 45:34.430
Have a wonderful trip.

45:36.599 --> 45:37.725
Put this on.

45:42.313 --> 45:43.606
You're coming with us.

45:44.107 --> 45:47.151
Out of the question. I am
a doctor, not a space explorer.

45:47.610 --> 45:49.862
What you are
is a murderous saboteur.

45:50.363 --> 45:51.197
I am not leaving you here...

45:51.614 --> 45:53.908
so you can do more harm
than you've already caused.

45:54.409 --> 45:55.701
I absolutely refuse.

45:57.703 --> 45:59.831
Give me an excuse to kill you.

46:01.207 --> 46:02.542
Please?

46:10.258 --> 46:13.177
Black was always my colour.

46:17.181 --> 46:18.391
Lock.

46:30.111 --> 46:32.071
Activate standby.

46:32.572 --> 46:35.199
Crush, kill, destroy.

46:38.286 --> 46:39.745
Surprise.

46:40.246 --> 46:41.414
Safety on.

46:42.874 --> 46:44.417
Dad, chill.
It's OK.

46:44.917 --> 46:47.086
I hacked into his CPU,
and then...

46:47.545 --> 46:50.339
I bypassed
his main operating systems...

46:50.840 --> 46:53.259
and accessed his subroutines.

46:53.676 --> 46:56.596
He's basically just running
on remote control.

46:59.182 --> 47:01.058
I know I haven't been around--

47:01.559 --> 47:02.685
Professor.

47:04.353 --> 47:05.730
We're ready to go.

47:08.065 --> 47:09.901
We'll talk later, son.

47:14.363 --> 47:15.948
Take care of my dad.

47:16.407 --> 47:18.034
OK, Robot?

47:27.668 --> 47:30.254
Vacuum check complete.

47:52.944 --> 47:54.070
Oxygen levels are normal.

47:54.528 --> 47:55.655
Microbe scans are negative.

47:56.113 --> 47:57.615
Clear.

48:01.494 --> 48:03.287
The air is stale, old.

48:03.788 --> 48:06.207
That's the smell of ghosts.

48:08.876 --> 48:11.754
I've got
her on-board computer up.

48:12.880 --> 48:13.839
Not working?

48:14.298 --> 48:15.383
She's working, all right.

48:15.841 --> 48:16.926
Just--I don't know.

48:17.385 --> 48:19.553
Too damn fast.

49:02.638 --> 49:04.849
Dad, do you hear something?

49:05.349 --> 49:06.851
Like the drip, drip of blood.

49:07.351 --> 49:09.728
You really need to shut up.

49:11.439 --> 49:12.565
Here.

49:23.951 --> 49:25.828
This matter appears biological.

49:26.871 --> 49:28.247
Nothing good will come of this.

49:28.747 --> 49:31.667
You, of course, being the expert
on space exploration.

49:34.211 --> 49:35.379
Let's go.

49:37.089 --> 49:38.674
Trust me, Major.

49:39.967 --> 49:42.970
Evil knows evil.

50:10.122 --> 50:11.832
Motion sensors
are still working.

50:12.249 --> 50:13.417
This way.

50:31.310 --> 50:33.812
Rambler-crane series robots.

50:34.313 --> 50:36.649
But like no design
I've ever seen.

50:37.107 --> 50:38.651
Well, well.

50:39.735 --> 50:41.528
Aren't we the poor cousin?

50:41.987 --> 50:43.530
Down here.

50:52.247 --> 50:54.124
It's a remote op station.

50:55.292 --> 50:56.835
Come on, Dr Smith.

50:59.713 --> 51:01.548
Could this ship be a prototype?

51:02.758 --> 51:04.843
Looks like some kind
of firefight.

51:07.179 --> 51:09.264
Captain's log is degraded.

51:10.391 --> 51:14.019
Maybe I can gather
some fragments.

51:18.023 --> 51:18.732
Sorry.

51:21.944 --> 51:24.363
The hyperspace tracker seems
to be functioning normally...

51:24.863 --> 51:28.200
but we cannot process
all the data.

51:29.535 --> 51:32.329
There is no sign
of the Jupiter 2.

51:32.830 --> 51:35.666
I have exceeded my timetable.

51:39.169 --> 51:40.295
When did he make Major?

51:40.754 --> 51:42.548
I want this on the record.

51:43.006 --> 51:46.719
I am not willing to give up.

51:47.177 --> 51:48.804
Don would keep looking for me.

51:56.353 --> 51:58.939
That's it. The rest
of the data's totally corrupted.

51:59.440 --> 52:01.859
How could they launch
a rescue mission for us...

52:02.276 --> 52:04.194
when we've only been lost a day?

52:04.695 --> 52:07.448
There's no data
on the alien ship...

52:07.948 --> 52:10.951
but they brought in something
that was attached to its hull.

52:12.995 --> 52:14.079
Got it.

52:19.418 --> 52:21.170
Some sort of egg sac?

52:33.265 --> 52:34.016
Get back here!

52:34.475 --> 52:37.394
Be happy to oblige...

52:37.853 --> 52:39.855
although I don't think it's me
you should be worrying about...

52:40.314 --> 52:41.857
but rather these.

52:48.405 --> 52:49.740
I'm detecting motion.

52:50.199 --> 52:51.742
Behind you.

52:54.161 --> 52:55.287
After it. Move!

53:00.083 --> 53:00.876
Bring Smith.

53:01.335 --> 53:04.171
Don't even think about it.

53:24.066 --> 53:24.983
Hydroponics.

53:25.484 --> 53:28.445
Growth like this
would take decades.

53:30.155 --> 53:32.491
Unhand me, you mechanical moron.

53:35.953 --> 53:37.996
Don't move.

53:47.214 --> 53:48.298
Easy.

53:48.799 --> 53:50.717
Easy there, buddy.

53:51.134 --> 53:52.970
No one's gonna hurt you.

53:55.180 --> 53:57.224
Easy.

53:59.476 --> 54:01.103
Relax.

54:07.609 --> 54:09.027
Excellent.

54:09.444 --> 54:11.655
Looks like you made a friend.

54:12.155 --> 54:12.864
Still, I'd wait a few weeks...

54:13.365 --> 54:15.325
before tattooing
her name on your arm.

54:17.744 --> 54:18.912
Do yourself a favour.

54:19.371 --> 54:20.580
Don't evolve.

54:21.873 --> 54:23.917
Charming.

54:24.459 --> 54:25.752
The Dr Dolittle of outer space.

54:26.211 --> 54:29.464
This could be a creature
from that alien ship.

54:29.923 --> 54:31.299
But this guy's no pilot.

54:31.758 --> 54:33.927
He looks like a child.

54:50.318 --> 54:53.113
Try it now.

54:56.992 --> 54:58.702
Strange.

54:59.202 --> 55:01.329
The scales are giving off heat.

55:01.830 --> 55:04.416
I've tapped into
the internal sensor array.

55:06.418 --> 55:08.837
There's no other
animate life present.

55:09.296 --> 55:11.923
Besides us,
this ship is totally deserted.

55:12.382 --> 55:14.342
A ghost ship.

55:14.801 --> 55:18.847
The flavour of the day
is banana beef.

55:21.057 --> 55:23.477
Who thinks up
these combinations?

55:31.777 --> 55:32.611
Good.

55:33.069 --> 55:35.739
Major West, I highly
recommend you never breed.

55:37.199 --> 55:40.202
That, by the way,
is my medical opinion.

56:00.722 --> 56:01.765
Little thing was hungry.

56:02.265 --> 56:03.892
I've got their star maps
on-line.

56:04.392 --> 56:05.894
Here we go.

56:06.394 --> 56:08.897
More systems
than I've ever seen.

56:09.356 --> 56:12.067
Finding a route to Alpha Prime.

56:12.526 --> 56:15.111
Downloading to Jupiter.

56:30.126 --> 56:32.379
I don't like the sound
of that sound.

56:41.137 --> 56:42.472
They're moving.

56:52.315 --> 56:54.150
Get this infernal...

56:54.567 --> 56:56.611
creature off me!

56:57.153 --> 56:57.862
Come here.

56:58.321 --> 57:00.991
John, get the hell out of there.

57:01.449 --> 57:04.119
Mom says,
'Get the hell out of there.'

57:33.148 --> 57:33.940
Evacuate.

57:34.399 --> 57:35.942
Now!

57:47.537 --> 57:48.997
The controls are too slow.

57:49.414 --> 57:50.665
Activate holographic interface.

57:51.166 --> 57:54.002
Holographic interface, on-line.

58:16.733 --> 58:19.402
They eat their wounded.

58:29.871 --> 58:31.331
Seal the bulkhead.

58:33.124 --> 58:34.250
Codes are locked.

58:39.589 --> 58:41.341
Duck.

58:44.219 --> 58:47.180
Emergency bulkhead.

58:55.688 --> 58:57.857
Fire sensor activated.

58:58.358 --> 59:00.026
Emergency bulkhead closure.

59:02.529 --> 59:03.822
Stop!

59:04.364 --> 59:06.407
We have to get that door open.

59:12.622 --> 59:13.289
Open, damn you!

59:13.790 --> 59:15.792
Get out of here.

59:16.292 --> 59:19.462
What is with me
and these damn doors?

59:19.963 --> 59:22.799
I can't override
the fire protocol!

59:25.260 --> 59:27.345
A million bucks
worth of weaponry...

59:28.513 --> 59:30.431
and I'd trade it all back...

59:31.516 --> 59:32.767
for a lousy...

59:34.394 --> 59:35.520
can of Raid.

59:51.494 --> 59:53.288
Stand clear.

01:00:07.385 --> 01:00:09.345
Get moving! Go!

01:00:15.768 --> 01:00:16.978
Come on!

01:00:17.437 --> 01:00:19.814
Maureen...
can you get me anything?

01:00:20.273 --> 01:00:22.525
Cycling through a vacuum check.
I'm overriding.

01:00:32.452 --> 01:00:34.329
No way it's that easy.

01:01:04.734 --> 01:01:06.319
Run!

01:01:08.446 --> 01:01:10.823
Run! Get back!
Get back to the ship!

01:01:11.282 --> 01:01:12.909
Move!

01:01:25.713 --> 01:01:27.048
Got it. Try it now.

01:01:27.548 --> 01:01:29.801
Mom says, 'Try it now.'

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:44.816
Can we save it?

01:01:45.358 --> 01:01:48.194
Can't without letting
the spiders into the ship.

01:01:48.653 --> 01:01:50.404
Leave him behind!

01:01:58.371 --> 01:02:01.833
That spider scratched me!

01:02:02.875 --> 01:02:04.752
Stop laughing, you little worm.

01:02:16.931 --> 01:02:18.057
Good-bye, Robot.

01:02:20.017 --> 01:02:20.977
You couldn't save him, kid.

01:02:21.435 --> 01:02:23.145
Save him? Of course.

01:02:29.277 --> 01:02:30.444
What are you trying to do?

01:02:34.031 --> 01:02:35.408
Prepare to disengage!

01:02:44.709 --> 01:02:46.544
This is a fun picnic.

01:02:47.003 --> 01:02:50.172
First yellow aliens,
now giant spiders.

01:03:00.057 --> 01:03:01.309
The crowd goes wild.

01:03:01.767 --> 01:03:03.519
Recall your childhood
nightmares, Major.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.313
Monsters are rarely
so easily dissuaded.

01:03:05.813 --> 01:03:08.357
Why don't you talk to them,
bug to bug?

01:03:08.858 --> 01:03:10.901
I think
they'd rather come inside.

01:03:20.202 --> 01:03:21.996
Arming torpedoes.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.166
Fire in the hole.

01:03:31.547 --> 01:03:34.216
Alert. Detonation failure.

01:03:36.552 --> 01:03:38.429
The robot must have damaged
the detonator cores.

01:03:38.929 --> 01:03:40.348
They won't blow.

01:03:40.765 --> 01:03:44.643
Alert.
Outer hub has been compromised.

01:03:45.895 --> 01:03:47.980
DNA extrapolation coming up.

01:03:48.522 --> 01:03:51.817
Silicone-based, mantium shell,
lack of respiratory system.

01:03:52.276 --> 01:03:54.320
Means they do live
in deep space.

01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:58.866
Tiny front brain implies
communal relationships.

01:03:59.367 --> 01:04:00.076
Like bees.

01:04:00.534 --> 01:04:02.870
If the biology lesson is over,
I could use some help.

01:04:03.329 --> 01:04:05.956
They may be attracted
to heat and light.

01:04:07.917 --> 01:04:11.045
Inner hull breach in 15 seconds.

01:04:11.504 --> 01:04:13.672
I'm bringing the Proteus
fusion drives on-line.

01:04:26.811 --> 01:04:27.561
It's working.

01:04:28.062 --> 01:04:29.522
Let's turn up the heat.

01:04:30.022 --> 01:04:30.773
What are you doing?

01:04:31.315 --> 01:04:32.817
Never leave an enemy stronghold
intact.

01:04:33.359 --> 01:04:34.068
Stop!

01:04:34.527 --> 01:04:36.153
That's one of your father's
first rules of engagement.

01:04:36.612 --> 01:04:37.446
That is a direct order.

01:04:37.905 --> 01:04:39.073
I hate spiders.

01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:07.309
That's coming fast.

01:05:07.768 --> 01:05:09.603
Get into the harnesses now.

01:05:10.062 --> 01:05:12.231
Manual helm, engage.

01:05:14.066 --> 01:05:15.693
-Children, secure?
-Secure.

01:05:16.151 --> 01:05:17.319
I'm in.

01:05:36.755 --> 01:05:38.215
Pull up.

01:05:38.674 --> 01:05:40.259
Really? No kidding.
Thanks.

01:05:45.306 --> 01:05:47.224
Coming in too hot.
I'll try and slow us down.

01:06:18.172 --> 01:06:19.298
Hang on!

01:06:41.653 --> 01:06:42.738
Everybody by the numbers.

01:06:43.197 --> 01:06:44.782
Life sciences,
still breathing.

01:06:47.034 --> 01:06:49.578
Video mechanics...
OK.

01:06:50.037 --> 01:06:51.789
Mission medical, I'm alive.

01:06:52.206 --> 01:06:53.791
Me, too.
Robotics, I mean.

01:06:54.208 --> 01:06:55.334
I'm alive...

01:06:55.834 --> 01:06:59.171
Major West's poor excuse for
piloting skills notwithstanding.

01:06:59.671 --> 01:07:02.383
Oh, Dorothy.

01:07:02.925 --> 01:07:04.468
Back in Kansas at last.

01:07:33.872 --> 01:07:36.125
You violated a direct order.

01:07:37.376 --> 01:07:39.419
About half the core
material's burned out.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.255
We'll never generate
enough power to break orbit.

01:07:41.755 --> 01:07:42.756
We can get off the ground...

01:07:43.173 --> 01:07:45.134
but getting back into space
is another story.

01:07:45.676 --> 01:07:49.221
I ordered you not to blow
that ship's reactors.

01:07:49.763 --> 01:07:52.391
Life support is marginal.

01:07:52.933 --> 01:07:53.892
It's gonna get cold in here
tonight.

01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:58.313
Also, the pod and the chariot
are pretty much scrap metal.

01:07:58.772 --> 01:08:00.274
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

01:08:00.774 --> 01:08:02.276
Give it a rest, Professor.

01:08:02.776 --> 01:08:04.194
I was technically
still in command.

01:08:04.611 --> 01:08:06.780
I am commander of this mission.

01:08:07.239 --> 01:08:08.407
Look, no offence...

01:08:08.866 --> 01:08:11.076
but you're an egghead
with an honorary rank.

01:08:11.577 --> 01:08:14.288
No one ever intended for you
to handle combat situations.

01:08:14.705 --> 01:08:17.791
You handled it brilliantly,
sending us crashing down here.

01:08:18.292 --> 01:08:21.002
Those aliens posed
a continuing threat.

01:08:21.502 --> 01:08:22.671
I made a judgement call...

01:08:23.171 --> 01:08:25.424
and, if I have to,
I'll make it again.

01:08:25.883 --> 01:08:27.259
You of all people
should understand that.

01:08:27.759 --> 01:08:28.719
Your father would back me up.

01:08:29.176 --> 01:08:29.928
My father is dead...

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:34.683
killed in one of those combat
missions you admire so much.

01:08:35.142 --> 01:08:37.144
My family is on this ship,
and you will follow my orders...

01:08:37.685 --> 01:08:39.688
whether you agree with them
or not. Is that clear?

01:08:40.104 --> 01:08:40.856
Save your speeches.

01:08:41.356 --> 01:08:42.941
I like you, but I'm gonna
do whatever it takes...

01:08:43.442 --> 01:08:44.776
to ensure the success
of this mission...

01:08:45.193 --> 01:08:47.529
with or without your help.
Is that clear?

01:08:47.988 --> 01:08:49.448
Am I interrupting something?

01:08:49.948 --> 01:08:51.950
No, really.

01:08:52.408 --> 01:08:54.536
I think you two
should slug it out.

01:08:56.662 --> 01:08:59.166
Here we are,
stranded on an alien world...

01:08:59.625 --> 01:09:01.292
and you want
to get into a pissing contest?

01:09:01.792 --> 01:09:03.879
Please, go for it.

01:09:04.379 --> 01:09:06.965
I'll have Judy down here
to declare you both unfit...

01:09:07.466 --> 01:09:08.216
and I'll take over this mission.

01:09:08.634 --> 01:09:12.054
I don't want to hear another
word from you. Is that clear?

01:09:13.138 --> 01:09:15.807
Not...another word.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:17.475
Better.

01:09:18.518 --> 01:09:20.937
If you've finished hosing down
the decks with testosterone...

01:09:21.479 --> 01:09:23.064
I suggest you come with me.

01:09:23.607 --> 01:09:25.399
I may have found a way
off this planet.

01:09:30.572 --> 01:09:32.323
Tell me about it.

01:10:11.321 --> 01:10:12.823
Damn bug bite.

01:10:30.006 --> 01:10:31.883
She...

01:10:32.384 --> 01:10:35.929
She really is an interesting
specimen. Huh, doc?

01:10:36.346 --> 01:10:37.639
She's fascinating.

01:10:39.349 --> 01:10:40.851
The retinal aperture dilation...

01:10:41.309 --> 01:10:43.937
seems directly linked
to the skin pigmentation.

01:10:47.065 --> 01:10:48.150
What?

01:10:50.193 --> 01:10:51.361
Can I keep her?

01:10:54.823 --> 01:10:57.826
She's not just another fad
you can pick up and throw away.

01:10:58.326 --> 01:11:00.370
Oh, please.

01:11:00.787 --> 01:11:03.707
She's all alone here, and
I promise I'll look out for her.

01:11:04.207 --> 01:11:05.876
I promise.

01:11:09.504 --> 01:11:11.089
She kind of needs me.

01:11:15.594 --> 01:11:17.304
The minute you misplace her,
you forget to feed her--

01:11:17.762 --> 01:11:19.848
Don't smile. I mean it, Pen.

01:11:21.266 --> 01:11:23.018
Thanks...doc.

01:11:26.354 --> 01:11:30.400
We're both a long way from home,
aren't we, little one?

01:11:34.321 --> 01:11:35.488
Blarp?

01:11:40.744 --> 01:11:43.455
That's what we'll call you--
Blarp.

01:11:49.502 --> 01:11:50.545
Nice girl.

01:11:51.004 --> 01:11:52.547
Pretty girl.

01:12:01.014 --> 01:12:02.140
Nice.

01:12:06.144 --> 01:12:09.481
The atmosphere here
can sustain human life.

01:12:09.898 --> 01:12:12.859
I've located 500 rads
of radioactive material...

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.819
five miles west.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.239
We'll need at least that much to
get the core functioning again.

01:12:19.324 --> 01:12:20.784
We start out at daybreak.

01:12:24.454 --> 01:12:25.830
Be safer that way.

01:12:28.959 --> 01:12:30.794
Those are my orders.

01:12:38.968 --> 01:12:41.304
I agree
with your recommendation.

01:12:42.722 --> 01:12:44.224
Détente's a beautiful thing.

01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:54.359
It's nice to see you found
a corner to suit your talents.

01:12:54.776 --> 01:12:56.444
Turn down the bed
before you leave.

01:12:56.903 --> 01:12:59.197
I gave my word I'd let you live.

01:13:00.824 --> 01:13:01.700
I never said for how long.

01:13:02.158 --> 01:13:04.828
Family hour is over.

01:13:05.286 --> 01:13:06.830
We're dying here.

01:13:07.288 --> 01:13:10.250
Robinson is out of his league.

01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:15.338
Look into his eyes and tell me
you can't see his fear.

01:13:17.966 --> 01:13:20.385
I fought in the millennial wars.

01:13:20.885 --> 01:13:22.011
Survival is a soldier's game.

01:13:22.512 --> 01:13:25.932
We both know this civilian fool
will lead us straight to hell.

01:13:26.391 --> 01:13:31.229
Robinson needs our help,
if he wants it or not.

01:13:31.729 --> 01:13:33.982
With minimal force,
we could take this ship...

01:13:34.399 --> 01:13:37.152
and assure them we shall
continue at your command.

01:13:38.403 --> 01:13:39.612
Of course.

01:13:40.155 --> 01:13:42.073
My God...

01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:44.033
you're right.

01:13:44.492 --> 01:13:46.786
How could I have been so blind?

01:13:47.328 --> 01:13:52.542
I'll just run and get you a gun
so we can hijack the ship, OK?

01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:57.505
Sarcasm is the recourse
of the weak mind.

01:13:59.132 --> 01:14:00.884
I'm hiding the pain.

01:14:01.342 --> 01:14:02.552
Really.

01:14:06.055 --> 01:14:07.182
Lock.

01:14:11.352 --> 01:14:13.229
Your pain...

01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:16.274
has just begun.

01:14:21.654 --> 01:14:23.281
Starlight, star bright.

01:14:27.327 --> 01:14:29.996
A million strange stars,
and only one wish.

01:14:30.413 --> 01:14:31.873
I wish we were home.

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:36.961
Never seen a sky look so alien.

01:14:37.462 --> 01:14:39.797
We really are lost,
aren't we?

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:48.765
When the first sailors
circled the globe...

01:14:49.265 --> 01:14:51.935
saw a brand-new sky...

01:14:52.435 --> 01:14:55.230
they thought they'd sailed
off the edge of the earth...

01:14:55.688 --> 01:14:57.273
but they were really
just around the corner.

01:14:59.984 --> 01:15:01.778
You're saying we should
just billow our sails...

01:15:02.278 --> 01:15:03.404
and let the wind take us home?

01:15:03.863 --> 01:15:05.198
Is that it?

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.743
Those sailors...

01:15:10.578 --> 01:15:13.915
found familiar shapes...

01:15:14.374 --> 01:15:16.250
in the stars...

01:15:16.793 --> 01:15:19.629
to make the sky seem
more friendly...

01:15:20.129 --> 01:15:21.005
and to help them
find their way home.

01:15:21.422 --> 01:15:24.217
That's how the constellations
were born.

01:15:26.594 --> 01:15:28.805
Porky, the wise and mighty pig.

01:15:46.572 --> 01:15:50.785
The great...
big-eared bunny Bugs.

01:16:01.254 --> 01:16:04.298
The way you got us down here,
that was pretty flying.

01:16:11.681 --> 01:16:13.641
My quarters or yours?

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:15.393
Excuse me?

01:16:15.893 --> 01:16:18.062
Don't play coy.

01:16:18.521 --> 01:16:21.649
We're the only single people
of consenting age in the galaxy.

01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:24.360
How much more of a set-up
do you need?

01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:28.990
So you figure, why not dispense
with the pleasantries...

01:16:29.449 --> 01:16:30.575
and get down to business?

01:16:31.117 --> 01:16:34.245
You have a way with words.

01:16:36.122 --> 01:16:37.874
Do you want to show me
how you handle the helm?

01:16:42.754 --> 01:16:45.131
Right here on this console?

01:16:49.635 --> 01:16:52.096
Right here would be fine.

01:17:02.106 --> 01:17:04.734
Why don't you just hang on
to your joystick?

01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:16.287
Excellent technique, Major.

01:17:18.206 --> 01:17:19.373
Really.

01:17:25.630 --> 01:17:27.298
Will was looking for you.

01:17:30.092 --> 01:17:31.385
I sent him back to his room.

01:17:31.844 --> 01:17:35.431
He's decided
he can rebuild the robot.

01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:39.727
He wants to stay up all night
and show me his designs.

01:17:41.187 --> 01:17:43.064
Funny creatures, men.

01:17:43.564 --> 01:17:46.359
Try so hard not to be
their fathers...

01:17:46.817 --> 01:17:49.028
end up making the same mistakes.

01:17:49.528 --> 01:17:54.116
We can't get off this planet,
let alone get back on course.

01:17:54.659 --> 01:17:55.743
I don't have time.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.745
Just listen to him.

01:17:58.162 --> 01:18:00.831
It doesn't matter what he says.
Just listen.

01:18:01.249 --> 01:18:04.502
Sometimes--especially
in the eyes of their fathers--

01:18:05.002 --> 01:18:07.255
little boys have to come first.

01:18:07.755 --> 01:18:10.341
As soon as
we get back up into space...

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.387
we'll spend a lot of time
together, I promise.

01:18:34.365 --> 01:18:37.243
It's nice having your
whole family under one roof.

01:18:39.578 --> 01:18:41.664
Even if we did have to go...

01:18:42.081 --> 01:18:44.709
halfway across the galaxy
to manage it.

01:18:57.930 --> 01:18:58.931
Good night, John.

01:18:59.348 --> 01:19:00.433
Good night, Maureen.

01:19:00.975 --> 01:19:02.768
Good night, Judy.

01:19:03.269 --> 01:19:04.395
Good night, Will.

01:19:05.396 --> 01:19:06.689
Good night, Penny.

01:19:09.316 --> 01:19:11.652
You guys have got to be kidding.

01:19:17.867 --> 01:19:19.827
Good morning, Will Robinson.

01:19:20.327 --> 01:19:23.414
Solar panels are charged.

01:19:40.723 --> 01:19:42.808
The radioactive material
we need for the core...

01:19:43.267 --> 01:19:44.769
is in the centre of that bubble.

01:19:45.227 --> 01:19:46.645
I was afraid of this.

01:19:48.105 --> 01:19:50.608
OK, everybody,
let's get settled now.

01:19:53.569 --> 01:19:55.988
I think this 'bubble'
out there...

01:19:56.447 --> 01:19:59.325
is exactly the same thing
we passed through in space.

01:19:59.867 --> 01:20:03.829
Both of them are opening
and closing doorways.

01:20:04.288 --> 01:20:05.915
Doorways to where?

01:20:06.373 --> 01:20:09.627
Doorways in...time.

01:20:10.169 --> 01:20:10.920
You can't be serious.

01:20:11.378 --> 01:20:13.172
Time travel is impossible.

01:20:13.589 --> 01:20:15.549
It's not.
Just improbable.

01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:19.470
What if we crossed
into a time...

01:20:19.929 --> 01:20:22.389
years after Earth
sent a rescue mission?

01:20:22.806 --> 01:20:24.808
Perhaps the professor
hit his head when we landed.

01:20:25.267 --> 01:20:26.018
Think about it.

01:20:26.519 --> 01:20:29.146
The way the Proteus
seemed deserted for so long.

01:20:29.647 --> 01:20:32.191
Your friend looking so old.

01:20:32.691 --> 01:20:34.652
So if we walk
inside that bubble...

01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:37.154
we could be walking
further into the future.

01:20:37.655 --> 01:20:40.950
Dad, what if the doorways
aren't natural?

01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:44.453
This kind of phenomenon could
only be produced naturally.

01:20:44.912 --> 01:20:46.872
That bubble's
the kind of side effect...

01:20:47.331 --> 01:20:49.625
I predicted my time machine
would do.

01:20:50.084 --> 01:20:51.418
What if someone built a device--

01:20:51.961 --> 01:20:54.880
Son...
I appreciate your input...

01:20:55.297 --> 01:20:56.674
but now is not the time
for flights of fancy.

01:20:57.174 --> 01:21:00.135
You never listen to me.

01:21:01.428 --> 01:21:03.138
Not ever.

01:21:11.772 --> 01:21:15.150
This time bubble could be
causing these earthquakes.

01:21:15.651 --> 01:21:19.613
No telling how long before
this planet breaks up entirely.

01:21:20.114 --> 01:21:21.949
The major and I
are going to locate...

01:21:22.449 --> 01:21:24.201
the radioactive material
for the core.

01:21:25.494 --> 01:21:27.621
We may have very little time.

01:21:39.049 --> 01:21:40.217
I'm leaving now.

01:21:40.759 --> 01:21:42.344
That's a surprise.

01:21:47.808 --> 01:21:51.520
You're the most important thing
in the world to me.

01:21:52.062 --> 01:21:54.982
One day, I hope you'll
be able to understand that.

01:21:55.441 --> 01:22:00.070
What if...
one time you don't come home?

01:22:03.907 --> 01:22:06.326
Whenever your grandfather
went on a mission...

01:22:14.626 --> 01:22:18.047
he'd leave these with me
for safekeeping.

01:22:19.423 --> 01:22:22.259
When he came home,
I would always be there...

01:22:22.718 --> 01:22:25.637
waiting to give them back.

01:22:28.432 --> 01:22:30.184
I'm coming back.

01:22:32.102 --> 01:22:33.312
I promise.

01:22:57.753 --> 01:22:59.004
Listen...

01:23:01.215 --> 01:23:02.341
about last night...

01:23:03.926 --> 01:23:06.261
Go on. You can do it.

01:23:07.971 --> 01:23:08.722
I'm sorry.

01:23:09.264 --> 01:23:11.850
See, that wasn't so difficult.

01:23:12.392 --> 01:23:15.229
Like pulling steel needles
through my cheeks.

01:23:15.729 --> 01:23:20.943
Then you understand
what saying this feels like.

01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:23.445
Try to come back in one piece.

01:23:28.116 --> 01:23:30.244
Listen, doc, I'm...

01:23:31.787 --> 01:23:34.206
I'm thinking this is your basic
'kiss for luck' occasion.

01:23:34.706 --> 01:23:35.999
Wouldn't you agree?

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.960
Thinking.

01:23:38.418 --> 01:23:40.337
It's not really
your strong suit, is it?

01:23:45.175 --> 01:23:47.553
I've got a fix
on the radioactive material.

01:24:01.358 --> 01:24:03.402
That was scientific.

01:24:04.736 --> 01:24:05.988
Scared?

01:24:07.573 --> 01:24:09.074
There's an alloy
in this crater wall...

01:24:09.575 --> 01:24:10.659
that's disabling the com-links.

01:24:11.118 --> 01:24:13.328
You're not going to be able
to communicate with the ship.

01:24:18.417 --> 01:24:20.377
Come home to me, Professor.

01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:24.339
I love you, wife.

01:24:30.137 --> 01:24:31.430
Come here, squirt.

01:24:43.692 --> 01:24:46.737
Nice girl.
Pretty girl. Nice.

01:25:17.601 --> 01:25:19.853
It's OK.
You're still in one piece.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:26.568
Come on.

01:25:31.031 --> 01:25:34.659
Can you hear me, Robot?
Hello?

01:25:35.577 --> 01:25:36.328
Systems error!

01:25:36.787 --> 01:25:38.622
Robot unable to locate
motor controls!

01:25:39.122 --> 01:25:39.831
Unable to--

01:25:40.332 --> 01:25:41.083
Calm down.

01:25:41.541 --> 01:25:43.919
What is happening to me?

01:25:44.377 --> 01:25:48.006
I didn't have enough time
to finish the download.

01:25:48.465 --> 01:25:49.966
Warning!
Penny, give it back!

01:25:50.425 --> 01:25:52.385
My circuits are unbalanced.

01:25:52.886 --> 01:25:54.971
So I had to finish you off
with another personality.

01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:57.432
I put my mind inside of yours.

01:26:02.896 --> 01:26:05.482
That explains
this warm fuzzy feeling...

01:26:05.899 --> 01:26:07.818
when I think about baseball.

01:26:08.276 --> 01:26:09.861
Strike! You're out!

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:11.613
But this does not compute.

01:26:12.072 --> 01:26:12.823
What?

01:26:13.281 --> 01:26:15.909
Robot tried to destroy
the Robinson family.

01:26:16.368 --> 01:26:18.995
Why did Will Robinson
save Robot's personality?

01:26:19.454 --> 01:26:22.958
I guess sometimes friendship
means listening to your heart...

01:26:23.458 --> 01:26:24.167
not your head.

01:26:24.626 --> 01:26:26.795
Put that in your memory bank.

01:26:28.630 --> 01:26:30.632
Don't worry.

01:26:32.926 --> 01:26:34.386
I'm gonna build you a new body.

01:26:36.096 --> 01:26:38.640
Mom always said I should
try to make new friends.

01:26:47.190 --> 01:26:49.025
I need a micro sealer.

01:26:49.526 --> 01:26:50.861
I got it.

01:26:57.909 --> 01:26:59.327
After much deliberation...

01:26:59.828 --> 01:27:01.746
the space captive
has finally decided...

01:27:02.205 --> 01:27:05.375
to accept her new role
as a member of the crew.

01:27:05.875 --> 01:27:09.004
The Robinsons, after all,
can obviously use her help.

01:27:11.631 --> 01:27:12.924
Blarp, come back here.

01:27:13.425 --> 01:27:15.885
Theoretically,
this future would be fixed...

01:27:16.344 --> 01:27:20.473
unchanged by what we do
or did in the past--

01:27:20.974 --> 01:27:23.184
Why don't you give
the old egghead a rest?

01:27:23.685 --> 01:27:27.939
Out here we got two moons,
a crater the size of Miami...

01:27:28.356 --> 01:27:31.192
and that would be
one great climb.

01:27:31.651 --> 01:27:33.570
My father would have liked you.

01:27:38.992 --> 01:27:40.201
What's that?

01:27:51.087 --> 01:27:52.547
This metal's decades old.

01:27:53.006 --> 01:27:55.300
What kind of a nightmare
is this?

01:27:57.135 --> 01:27:57.886
Where the hell are we?

01:27:58.386 --> 01:28:00.513
The question is,
when the hell are we?

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.580
I will tell you a joke.

01:28:26.122 --> 01:28:28.249
Why did the robot
cross the road?

01:28:28.708 --> 01:28:31.503
Because he was carbon-bonded
to the chicken.

01:28:31.961 --> 01:28:33.630
We have a lot of work to do.

01:28:37.425 --> 01:28:39.385
That sounds like old Morse code.

01:28:39.886 --> 01:28:40.929
What does it say?

01:28:41.429 --> 01:28:43.681
'Danger,
Will Robinson, danger.'

01:29:08.581 --> 01:29:10.583
William. Come in.

01:29:12.377 --> 01:29:13.586
Unlock.

01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:18.758
You said someone was in danger.

01:29:19.259 --> 01:29:20.677
We all are.

01:29:21.136 --> 01:29:22.846
You are wise to arm yourself.

01:29:23.304 --> 01:29:25.849
This gun is set to fire
for me only...

01:29:26.307 --> 01:29:29.310
so don't try anything funny.
Lock.

01:29:32.605 --> 01:29:36.526
You misjudge me.
I only want to help you.

01:29:37.026 --> 01:29:39.320
Help us?
You tried to kill us.

01:29:39.737 --> 01:29:41.865
But now our fates
are intertwined.

01:29:42.407 --> 01:29:45.577
If your father
and that idiot West fail...

01:29:46.035 --> 01:29:48.496
I have no chance
of getting home.

01:29:48.955 --> 01:29:52.876
It's in my best interests
that they succeed...

01:29:53.334 --> 01:29:56.880
and I always follow
my best interests.

01:29:59.549 --> 01:30:06.848
What monsters roam
these alien wilds?

01:30:07.307 --> 01:30:09.475
They're fools!

01:30:09.976 --> 01:30:13.730
To set off blindly
across this savage land.

01:30:16.065 --> 01:30:17.650
Much as I hate to admit it...

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:22.113
it will be much harder
without them.

01:30:22.488 --> 01:30:24.282
What are you talking about?

01:30:24.741 --> 01:30:27.910
They'll be back.
They'll be OK.

01:30:30.371 --> 01:30:31.456
Will they?

01:30:34.834 --> 01:30:36.336
Someone should go after them.

01:30:36.794 --> 01:30:37.503
Unlock.

01:30:37.962 --> 01:30:39.380
I forbid it. You're a boy.

01:30:39.839 --> 01:30:41.049
A clever one,
but a child nonetheless.

01:30:41.549 --> 01:30:43.885
This planet
is likely full of predators.

01:30:44.344 --> 01:30:48.514
Even if you found them,
what if they're hurt? Ravaged?

01:30:53.019 --> 01:30:54.187
Dying?

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.025
What good could you do?

01:31:03.112 --> 01:31:06.282
You can help them.
You're a doctor.

01:31:13.456 --> 01:31:15.416
I'm a doctor.

01:31:18.044 --> 01:31:19.253
We made it.

01:31:19.253 --> 01:31:21.381
Mom didn't see us.

01:31:21.839 --> 01:31:24.008
That's fantastic.

01:31:26.469 --> 01:31:29.680
I told you we could get
into the bubble this way.

01:31:35.269 --> 01:31:36.437
The bubble's growing!

01:31:40.733 --> 01:31:43.945
Run, child!

01:32:00.253 --> 01:32:02.004
Cool.

01:32:02.421 --> 01:32:04.215
Wait!

01:32:10.429 --> 01:32:13.933
Come on.
We can always go back.

01:32:14.433 --> 01:32:16.394
It's just like stepping
between two rooms.

01:32:16.894 --> 01:32:18.771
I can barely contain my glee.

01:32:20.148 --> 01:32:23.442
Dad's signal is...
this way.

01:32:27.113 --> 01:32:28.823
I loathe children.

01:32:49.385 --> 01:32:51.888
Billy...kissing...

01:32:52.346 --> 01:32:57.560
hot wings, orchids, corn.

01:32:58.978 --> 01:33:05.860
Waves...Billy...
popcorn with...kissing...

01:33:06.319 --> 01:33:09.864
What did you find?

01:33:10.323 --> 01:33:12.909
Come on.
No time to dawdle.

01:33:13.367 --> 01:33:16.412
Let's move along.

01:33:18.122 --> 01:33:20.750
Follow your father's signal.

01:33:22.209 --> 01:33:23.377
Come on.

01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:57.411
All things really do come
to he who waits.

01:34:07.296 --> 01:34:07.963
What is this place?

01:34:08.464 --> 01:34:10.800
The shock must have
scrambled your brain.

01:34:11.342 --> 01:34:13.344
Take a look around.

01:34:18.099 --> 01:34:20.142
Don't you recognize this spot?

01:34:24.563 --> 01:34:26.649
You're home.

01:34:32.530 --> 01:34:33.406
This can't be.

01:34:33.864 --> 01:34:36.325
What have you done to the ship?

01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:39.578
Where is my family?

01:34:40.996 --> 01:34:44.333
What chance do you think
your family had without you?

01:34:44.875 --> 01:34:48.212
A few spiders survived
the destruction of the Proteus.

01:34:48.671 --> 01:34:51.507
They reached this planet and...

01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:59.265
I can still hear
the women scream.

01:35:03.477 --> 01:35:04.270
Who are you?

01:35:04.728 --> 01:35:06.230
You don't recognize me?

01:35:14.196 --> 01:35:16.782
I'm your son Will.

01:35:21.495 --> 01:35:23.122
Dad's signal
is just over this ridge.

01:35:23.664 --> 01:35:26.667
Be still, my foolish heart.

01:35:27.084 --> 01:35:28.711
Shit.

01:35:29.128 --> 01:35:32.256
A boy of your intelligence
should never swear.

01:35:35.426 --> 01:35:37.136
Shit.

01:35:40.848 --> 01:35:42.224
Indeed.

01:35:46.604 --> 01:35:48.105
Look, Father...

01:35:48.564 --> 01:35:53.777
what my flights of fancy
have wrought.

01:35:55.196 --> 01:35:59.533
I used your hyper engine
to build my time machine.

01:36:01.744 --> 01:36:03.370
OK, Robot, put him down.

01:36:03.829 --> 01:36:05.372
Affirmative.

01:36:11.503 --> 01:36:12.546
Where are we?

01:36:12.963 --> 01:36:15.466
I think the Jupiter 2,
but in a different future.

01:36:15.883 --> 01:36:17.426
Father?

01:36:17.885 --> 01:36:18.802
Once this core material...

01:36:19.261 --> 01:36:21.972
is fully introduced
into the control console...

01:36:22.473 --> 01:36:24.350
Core material.

01:36:24.850 --> 01:36:27.227
If we could get that
back to our Jupiter...

01:36:27.728 --> 01:36:32.983
I will open a doorway
stable enough...

01:36:33.484 --> 01:36:38.030
for one person to take
one trip through time...

01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:40.491
and space as well.

01:36:40.991 --> 01:36:44.078
Commence proto-generation.

01:36:45.412 --> 01:36:47.164
Cool, huh?

01:36:47.623 --> 01:36:51.293
Today, I will change history.

01:36:53.337 --> 01:36:56.340
I'm gonna go back to that day
you dragged us into space.

01:36:57.967 --> 01:37:00.344
I'll stop the ship
from taking off.

01:37:03.764 --> 01:37:05.474
I'll save the family.

01:37:05.891 --> 01:37:08.769
Earth, October 1, 2058.

01:37:09.228 --> 01:37:10.521
Target lock confirmed.

01:37:10.979 --> 01:37:11.689
Excellent.

01:37:12.147 --> 01:37:13.524
Son...

01:37:14.858 --> 01:37:16.151
Look around.

01:37:17.319 --> 01:37:20.739
The force of your time machine
is ripping this planet apart.

01:37:21.198 --> 01:37:23.117
These violent distortions
in time...

01:37:23.617 --> 01:37:25.285
are being caused
by your experiment.

01:37:25.786 --> 01:37:28.914
What if it has the same effect
on Earth?

01:37:29.415 --> 01:37:30.958
What if, in getting home...

01:37:31.417 --> 01:37:33.377
you destroy Earth
in the process?

01:37:40.884 --> 01:37:42.553
I know you mean well.

01:37:44.138 --> 01:37:45.681
I'm going home.

01:37:46.223 --> 01:37:47.474
I'm going to save the family.

01:37:47.933 --> 01:37:51.145
You've got to listen to me.
I'm your father!

01:37:52.396 --> 01:37:54.022
My father?

01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:58.444
Let me tell you about my father.

01:37:58.902 --> 01:38:01.738
I'll never forget
that morning 20 years ago.

01:38:02.197 --> 01:38:04.241
What was it you said?

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:06.869
'I'm coming back.
I promise.'

01:38:07.411 --> 01:38:09.580
You promised...
and you never came home.

01:38:10.038 --> 01:38:13.834
My father's not
coming to the rescue.

01:38:38.358 --> 01:38:39.985
What do you think you're doing,
young man?

01:38:40.444 --> 01:38:42.237
Let me tell you about life.

01:38:42.696 --> 01:38:44.281
Around every corner,
monsters wait.

01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:45.908
I know. I am one.

01:38:46.366 --> 01:38:49.328
We monsters have no fear
in devouring little boys.

01:38:49.786 --> 01:38:51.914
To survive, you must be
fully prepared to kill.

01:38:52.414 --> 01:38:53.832
I can do it.

01:38:54.333 --> 01:38:55.459
Can you?

01:38:58.337 --> 01:39:00.255
Listen to me, my child...

01:39:00.714 --> 01:39:02.507
I've crossed this world
with you...

01:39:02.925 --> 01:39:06.720
risked my life,
but I would not throw it away.

01:39:07.179 --> 01:39:10.057
Who knows what dangers
lie ahead?

01:39:11.433 --> 01:39:12.768
You can't protect us.

01:39:14.394 --> 01:39:15.604
I can.

01:39:17.272 --> 01:39:18.440
I will.

01:39:20.442 --> 01:39:22.486
Gimme the gun.

01:39:22.986 --> 01:39:24.529
Enable gun for all users.

01:39:24.988 --> 01:39:26.657
Voiceprint confirmed.

01:39:28.408 --> 01:39:31.787
A brief lesson in survival
on this world or any other--

01:39:32.246 --> 01:39:35.874
never trust anyone.
Especially me.

01:39:40.337 --> 01:39:42.881
It's almost time.
I hope it works.

01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:44.508
Never fear...

01:39:45.676 --> 01:39:46.843
Smith is here.

01:39:48.095 --> 01:39:49.888
Don't move,
Professor Robinson...

01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:53.892
or this peculiar family reunion
will be tragically brief.

01:39:54.434 --> 01:39:55.936
I'll ask you
to step away from that.

01:39:56.478 --> 01:39:58.021
It's a time machine,
you idiot.

01:39:58.563 --> 01:40:01.024
I had hoped to take over
the ship with this.

01:40:01.525 --> 01:40:04.277
One of life's little ironies.

01:40:04.778 --> 01:40:07.781
Let's try this dance again.

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:10.283
You are the puppet,
I am the puppeteer.

01:40:10.784 --> 01:40:14.162
Do try to get it right
this time.

01:40:14.663 --> 01:40:17.791
Robot, you will respond
to my voice alone.

01:40:18.250 --> 01:40:19.001
Affirmative.

01:40:19.501 --> 01:40:21.545
We need electric disrupters.

01:40:25.090 --> 01:40:27.134
That's good, gargantuan.

01:40:29.428 --> 01:40:32.222
You did it.
Just like I imagined.

01:40:32.681 --> 01:40:34.224
You linked
the dimensional sifter...

01:40:34.641 --> 01:40:35.809
to the navigational array.

01:40:36.309 --> 01:40:38.895
That's how it can be in
the same place at the same time.

01:40:39.396 --> 01:40:43.984
But the spatial delivery system,
the targeting laser...

01:40:44.484 --> 01:40:45.485
I never thought of those.

01:40:45.944 --> 01:40:49.865
The future is never what
it seems like when you're 10.

01:40:50.365 --> 01:40:53.076
Say good-bye to your past!

01:40:53.577 --> 01:40:55.787
Your future lies with me.

01:40:56.288 --> 01:40:58.248
I'm going home in your place.

01:41:01.293 --> 01:41:03.086
What are you grinning at?

01:41:05.338 --> 01:41:09.926
Look around you...
at this hostile world.

01:41:10.427 --> 01:41:13.805
Do you think a boy
could have survived all alone?

01:41:14.973 --> 01:41:17.517
Never fear...
Smith is here.

01:41:19.269 --> 01:41:20.479
It's Dr Smith.

01:41:21.021 --> 01:41:22.230
Hello.

01:41:22.689 --> 01:41:26.193
How nice to see me again
after all these years.

01:41:26.610 --> 01:41:28.528
Confused?
Have I changed?

01:41:29.029 --> 01:41:32.491
The spider's sting had some
unexpected side effects.

01:41:32.949 --> 01:41:35.494
My unique gifts
gave me an advantage...

01:41:35.952 --> 01:41:37.954
in this quarrelsome world.

01:41:38.413 --> 01:41:40.624
After the women were savaged...

01:41:41.124 --> 01:41:45.754
I became the father
Will never had.

01:41:46.296 --> 01:41:51.968
Two decades of agony taught me
the error of my ways.

01:41:52.511 --> 01:41:57.599
But you, your crude ambition
fills me with self-loathing.

01:41:58.016 --> 01:42:01.019
You see,
I have looked within me...

01:42:01.561 --> 01:42:03.813
and what I see is you!

01:42:12.072 --> 01:42:14.908
I never liked me anyway.

01:42:15.367 --> 01:42:17.577
Robot, kill them all.

01:42:18.662 --> 01:42:19.621
Wait.

01:42:20.121 --> 01:42:22.332
Dr Smith, please.

01:42:25.001 --> 01:42:26.836
Don't.

01:42:33.218 --> 01:42:34.970
Very well.

01:42:35.428 --> 01:42:37.973
Robot, take them inside
and keep them there.

01:42:38.473 --> 01:42:41.726
If they move...
then kill them.

01:42:42.227 --> 01:42:45.272
Proceed or be destroyed.

01:43:08.253 --> 01:43:09.421
Nothing works.

01:43:11.881 --> 01:43:13.758
I'll draw his fire,
you grab Will and get out.

01:43:14.217 --> 01:43:15.385
Halt!

01:43:16.636 --> 01:43:18.221
Stop!

01:43:19.723 --> 01:43:21.516
Do you remember me?

01:43:22.058 --> 01:43:25.353
Do you remember what I
taught you about friendship?

01:43:28.857 --> 01:43:31.860
I need you to help us now,
because we're friends.

01:43:32.402 --> 01:43:34.738
Logic error.
Friendship does not compute.

01:43:35.238 --> 01:43:37.991
Forget logic.
Act with your heart.

01:43:38.533 --> 01:43:41.119
Robot has no heart.

01:43:41.619 --> 01:43:43.788
Robot is powered by
a fusion pulse generator.

01:43:44.247 --> 01:43:45.540
Every living thing has a heart.

01:43:45.999 --> 01:43:48.918
My programming has been modified
to remove all emotion.

01:43:49.377 --> 01:43:51.212
Any attempts to override
command protocols...

01:43:51.713 --> 01:43:53.631
may result infusing
my neural net.

01:43:57.802 --> 01:43:58.720
Please, Robot?

01:43:59.137 --> 01:44:01.014
If you don't let us go,
we're all gonna die.

01:44:01.514 --> 01:44:04.350
I'm asking you now,
will you help us?

01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:07.395
Will you be my friend?

01:44:11.608 --> 01:44:14.027
Robot attempting
to deactivate control bolt.

01:44:14.444 --> 01:44:16.780
-Commands overridden!
-Do it!

01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.282
Destroy Robinson family!

01:44:19.699 --> 01:44:21.409
Destroy!

01:44:31.878 --> 01:44:33.129
You did it.

01:44:35.548 --> 01:44:37.258
Robot will save Will Robinson.

01:44:37.717 --> 01:44:40.220
Robot will save his friend.

01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:46.392
Where are they?

01:44:59.906 --> 01:45:01.032
Wait here.

01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:03.618
Without that core...

01:45:04.118 --> 01:45:05.954
I can't promise
we'll get off this rock.

01:45:06.412 --> 01:45:08.623
See if you can make it
back to our Jupiter.

01:45:09.123 --> 01:45:10.208
I'll get the core material
and meet you there.

01:45:10.667 --> 01:45:12.252
We don't have the trackers
to find our way back.

01:45:12.752 --> 01:45:14.921
The family needs their father.

01:45:15.421 --> 01:45:16.965
The crew needs their pilot.

01:45:17.423 --> 01:45:20.468
I can't fly the ship
as well as you can.

01:45:20.969 --> 01:45:23.263
You're their best chance
to survive.

01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:25.348
Listen to me.

01:45:25.765 --> 01:45:27.934
I know you never wanted
to take this job.

01:45:28.476 --> 01:45:31.938
I think you're going to turn out
to be a grade-A baby-sitter.

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:36.025
So...
the camper's all yours now.

01:45:36.567 --> 01:45:37.735
Take care of them.

01:45:38.945 --> 01:45:40.029
Good luck.

01:45:40.571 --> 01:45:41.781
-Dad!
-Professor!

01:45:45.118 --> 01:45:48.246
Remember the space spiders
in the Proteus?

01:45:52.208 --> 01:45:54.877
They're not going to be able
to get back.

01:45:57.297 --> 01:45:58.673
Enable all missiles.

01:46:00.717 --> 01:46:01.884
But the warheads don't work.

01:46:02.343 --> 01:46:03.469
Just do it.

01:46:05.847 --> 01:46:07.390
Look!

01:46:12.478 --> 01:46:14.981
Damn, he's still breathing.

01:46:18.359 --> 01:46:19.444
Fire in the hole.

01:46:26.075 --> 01:46:29.328
So these sailors,
they drew shapes in the sky...

01:46:31.873 --> 01:46:34.333
Look! It's a flare!

01:46:36.294 --> 01:46:37.795
...to help them
find their way home.

01:46:38.254 --> 01:46:39.756
Danger, Will Robinson!

01:46:55.521 --> 01:46:58.566
Climb on! Hurry!

01:47:08.201 --> 01:47:10.745
Field dampeners on-line.

01:47:11.287 --> 01:47:13.456
Portal compression commenced.

01:47:22.882 --> 01:47:27.011
Tell me again, old monster,
how did the girls die?

01:47:27.512 --> 01:47:30.765
We've been over this before,
son.

01:47:34.268 --> 01:47:35.853
In all the years since...

01:47:38.481 --> 01:47:41.067
the spiders
have never resurfaced.

01:47:43.986 --> 01:47:44.987
Why?

01:47:45.404 --> 01:47:50.409
Let's forget the past.

01:47:54.247 --> 01:47:58.000
Portal aperture reduction, 50%.

01:48:03.214 --> 01:48:05.758
Careful, child!
The plasma around the portal...

01:48:06.259 --> 01:48:08.427
will rip a man into pieces!

01:48:14.016 --> 01:48:18.062
Haven't you made the doorway...
too small?

01:48:18.563 --> 01:48:19.855
Not for me.

01:48:21.482 --> 01:48:23.859
But then I'm not going, am l?

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.904
Spiders didn't kill the girls.

01:48:28.698 --> 01:48:29.574
It was you.

01:48:29.991 --> 01:48:32.868
I just never let myself see it.

01:48:33.327 --> 01:48:36.205
You kept me alive
because you needed me.

01:48:36.747 --> 01:48:39.375
Because I could
build this for you.

01:48:40.626 --> 01:48:42.503
Poor boy.

01:48:43.045 --> 01:48:47.133
Did you really think
I would let you go home?

01:48:47.592 --> 01:48:52.513
Let all that I have become
vanish?

01:48:53.014 --> 01:48:55.516
Look at me!
I am no mere man!

01:48:56.017 --> 01:48:56.851
l...am...a...god!

01:49:01.105 --> 01:49:03.232
Within these egg sacs
grow the seeds...

01:49:03.649 --> 01:49:05.943
of a master race of spiders.

01:49:06.444 --> 01:49:09.030
We shall descend upon
helpless Earth...

01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:10.865
an entire planet to rule!

01:49:11.407 --> 01:49:14.452
An entire planet
on which to feed!

01:49:16.495 --> 01:49:18.956
Time to die...son.

01:49:19.498 --> 01:49:20.958
I'm not your son.

01:49:21.417 --> 01:49:23.878
Good-bye.

01:49:35.973 --> 01:49:37.224
My father once said...

01:49:38.851 --> 01:49:41.312
'Evil always finds
its true form.'

01:49:42.188 --> 01:49:44.732
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

01:49:45.191 --> 01:49:47.735
You were right.
I couldn't kill the man...

01:49:49.153 --> 01:49:50.654
but I can kill the monster!

01:49:54.617 --> 01:49:57.953
Spare me
the fury of the righteous.

01:49:58.662 --> 01:50:03.751
I think there's time for a snack
before my trip.

01:50:10.758 --> 01:50:12.259
The pain.

01:50:14.261 --> 01:50:16.180
You ain't seen nothing yet.

01:50:24.355 --> 01:50:25.898
Remember the Proteus?

01:50:26.398 --> 01:50:28.400
These monsters
eat their wounded.

01:50:42.039 --> 01:50:45.251
Take all the time you want
to die!

01:51:17.658 --> 01:51:20.870
Wake up, son!

01:51:21.287 --> 01:51:22.454
Dad?

01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:32.423
Core material insertion
complete.

01:51:34.425 --> 01:51:37.845
All table run--2058.

01:51:38.345 --> 01:51:39.096
Mission control.

01:51:39.555 --> 01:51:42.558
You could've taken the core
and left before it was too late.

01:51:43.058 --> 01:51:45.561
I couldn't let you fall.

01:51:46.061 --> 01:51:47.354
You're my boy.

01:51:55.487 --> 01:51:57.364
Mom! It's them.

01:52:03.662 --> 01:52:05.164
Hi, Mom!

01:52:07.291 --> 01:52:08.000
You all right?

01:52:08.542 --> 01:52:09.251
You're not as dumb as you look.

01:52:09.752 --> 01:52:11.378
I'm gonna get your name
tattooed right here.

01:52:13.255 --> 01:52:14.965
Greetings.

01:52:15.424 --> 01:52:16.800
Where's John?

01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:20.971
The bubble closed behind us.

01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:24.308
It was his only way back.

01:52:24.808 --> 01:52:26.769
I'm sorry.

01:52:28.354 --> 01:52:31.398
We've already begun
the pre-flight countdown.

01:52:31.899 --> 01:52:34.360
I'm going to save
as many lives as I can.

01:52:46.121 --> 01:52:48.457
I kept hoping somehow
he'd make it back.

01:52:55.089 --> 01:52:56.465
Let's go, Major.

01:52:57.841 --> 01:52:59.259
Good-bye, my love.

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:02.262
Engaging primary thrusters now.

01:53:39.383 --> 01:53:42.010
Look. He made it.

01:53:54.648 --> 01:53:55.399
Go.

01:54:04.616 --> 01:54:05.742
We're not getting any altitude.

01:54:06.201 --> 01:54:08.871
We don't have enough power.

01:54:18.130 --> 01:54:19.381
I'm sorry.

01:54:37.316 --> 01:54:39.276
I couldn't save them.

01:54:44.281 --> 01:54:46.950
So many years ago.

01:54:47.409 --> 01:54:48.910
I can still feel it--

01:54:49.453 --> 01:54:51.163
our sun...

01:54:52.456 --> 01:54:53.790
our Earth.

01:54:55.959 --> 01:54:59.921
It's all I thought about--
going home.

01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:05.469
A long time ago,
you told a small boy...

01:55:05.969 --> 01:55:09.890
that one day he'd understand
how much his father loved him.

01:55:12.142 --> 01:55:15.646
I could never see
how much you cared...

01:55:18.523 --> 01:55:19.900
until now.

01:55:20.359 --> 01:55:21.109
Come.

01:55:21.568 --> 01:55:23.695
Let's go.

01:55:26.490 --> 01:55:28.950
I kept hoping he'd make it back.

01:55:29.409 --> 01:55:31.286
Good-bye, my love.

01:55:34.539 --> 01:55:35.707
Look!

01:55:37.417 --> 01:55:40.379
Don't make me wait another
lifetime to know how you feel.

01:55:49.971 --> 01:55:51.014
Dad!

01:55:56.978 --> 01:56:00.982
Dad, it worked!

01:56:02.317 --> 01:56:03.068
Come with us!

01:56:03.527 --> 01:56:05.237
I can't.

01:56:05.737 --> 01:56:09.825
Only enough power for
one person, one trip, remember?

01:56:15.455 --> 01:56:17.165
It's good to see you again, Mom.

01:56:17.624 --> 01:56:19.835
It's good to see you all.

01:56:20.293 --> 01:56:22.337
Take care of them, Will.

01:56:29.594 --> 01:56:31.847
Don't forget me.

01:56:32.681 --> 01:56:35.183
He sacrificed everything
for his family.

01:56:42.816 --> 01:56:44.276
I'm glad you came back.

01:56:46.069 --> 01:56:48.697
I just want you to know
I love you.

01:56:50.282 --> 01:56:52.075
I love you very much.

01:57:00.792 --> 01:57:03.170
The planet
is breaking up around us.

01:57:09.718 --> 01:57:12.387
We're doomed!

01:57:17.142 --> 01:57:18.101
Boy, that felt good.

01:57:18.518 --> 01:57:20.312
Get us airborne.

01:57:22.314 --> 01:57:25.066
I'm going to try
to reach escape velocity.

01:57:25.567 --> 01:57:26.902
We don't have the core material.

01:57:27.444 --> 01:57:28.570
The gravity wells
will pull us back down.

01:57:29.029 --> 01:57:30.155
We might be able to--

01:57:30.655 --> 01:57:33.408
We won't make it. I know.

01:57:34.743 --> 01:57:35.994
We have to go...

01:57:38.246 --> 01:57:39.706
down--

01:57:40.165 --> 01:57:42.334
through the planet
as she's breaking up.

01:57:42.792 --> 01:57:45.921
We can use
the planet's gravity...

01:57:46.421 --> 01:57:47.130
What?

01:57:47.672 --> 01:57:50.508
to throw us out the other side
and back into space.

01:57:50.967 --> 01:57:51.927
That's insane.

01:57:52.427 --> 01:57:54.262
I don't have time to argue.

01:57:58.892 --> 01:58:00.477
That's a direct order.

01:58:03.104 --> 01:58:04.564
Yes, sir, Commander.

01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:08.652
This should be interesting.

01:58:40.558 --> 01:58:41.351
I see it.

01:58:41.851 --> 01:58:42.977
Full burn.

01:58:53.321 --> 01:58:54.030
Stop!

01:58:54.489 --> 01:58:55.281
-Right!
-Left!

01:58:55.782 --> 01:58:56.950
Let me drive.

01:59:05.041 --> 01:59:07.836
All right, everybody,
hold your noses.

01:59:29.566 --> 01:59:31.776
Rock and roll.

02:00:01.764 --> 02:00:04.225
Amazing.

02:00:11.191 --> 02:00:12.901
Nice work, flyboy.

02:00:13.443 --> 02:00:15.486
I earn that kiss yet?

02:00:15.945 --> 02:00:17.322
You earn this.

02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:25.622
This one's on credit.

02:00:35.381 --> 02:00:36.925
Cold fish, huh?

02:00:56.235 --> 02:00:58.571
There you are. Come here.

02:00:59.614 --> 02:01:03.076
Where have you been,
you little creep?

02:01:03.534 --> 02:01:05.161
-Little creep?
-Oh, great.

02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:06.704
Warning, Major West.

02:01:07.205 --> 02:01:10.083
My sensors indicate
we have a problem.

02:01:14.379 --> 02:01:16.839
The planet's gravity field
is collapsing.

02:01:17.340 --> 02:01:18.049
We'll be sucked in.

02:01:18.549 --> 02:01:19.801
No way to get clear in time.

02:01:20.301 --> 02:01:21.719
The hyperdrive.

02:01:22.220 --> 02:01:24.222
I'm accessing
the Proteus star maps.

02:01:24.722 --> 02:01:25.765
Here we go again.

02:01:26.265 --> 02:01:28.601
Targeting Alpha Prime...
I hope.

02:01:30.853 --> 02:01:32.146
Initiate...now.
