00:10.094 --> 00:14.265
<i>NARRATOR". Gotham City, a glistening
jewel in a sun-filled landscape...</i>

00:14.474 --> 00:17.727
<i>...on a day when all seems right
with the world.</i>

00:17.936 --> 00:24.067
<i>But in stately Wayne Manor,
some of life's answers still prove elusive.</i>

00:28.613 --> 00:31.115
Gosh, Bruce,
I'm not really sure how important it is...

00:31.324 --> 00:35.495
...to know the maximum number of pieces
a pie will yield after six cuts.

00:35.703 --> 00:39.249
Well, if you had a house full of guests
and only one pie...

00:39.457 --> 00:41.417
...you'd find it was important.

00:41.626 --> 00:45.964
The trick to this pie puzzle, Dick,
is to discover a rule...

00:46.172 --> 00:49.717
...that will give you
the maximum number of pieces...

00:49.926 --> 00:53.972
...for any given number of cuts.

00:54.889 --> 00:57.100
Now, notice-- Thank you.

00:57.934 --> 01:01.938
--Cut number one yields two pieces.

01:02.146 --> 01:03.189
Right.

01:03.398 --> 01:07.777
Cut number two yields four pieces.

01:07.986 --> 01:09.487
Right.

01:09.946 --> 01:12.949
Do you detect any pattern yet, Dick?

01:13.157 --> 01:15.952
It looks as if each cut adds a number
of pieces...

01:16.160 --> 01:18.871
...that is always equal
to the number of the out.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.291
Bravo, Dick.
I think you're beginning to get it.

01:21.499 --> 01:27.797
As long as each cut intersects the lines of
the previous cut, that rule should hold true.

01:28.006 --> 01:32.552
Now, if we draw the next line
in that manner...

01:32.760 --> 01:35.972
...and count the pieces,
I'm sure you'll find they'll total seven.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.141
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.685
Seven. Right again, Bruce.

01:42.145 --> 01:43.271
The Batphone, sir.

01:43.479 --> 01:45.106
Thank you, Alfred.

01:45.565 --> 01:48.151
Here, Aunt Harriet,
see how many pieces you can get out of this.

01:51.487 --> 01:55.074
Oh, Alfred, I'm certainly glad I have you.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.118
Thank you, madam.

01:57.327 --> 01:59.037
Always happy to be of service.

02:00.788 --> 02:04.959
- Yes, commissioner?
-A very serious situation has arisen, Batman.

02:05.168 --> 02:06.836
<i>BRUCE".
What, commissioner?</i>

02:07.545 --> 02:11.382
Well, for once,
I'm afraid it's of such vital importance...

02:11.591 --> 02:14.844
...and might have
such far-reaching consequences...

02:15.053 --> 02:18.806
...I think we should not even discuss it
over the Batphone.

02:19.015 --> 02:20.183
That bad, commissioner?

02:20.391 --> 02:22.685
<i>That bad or worse.</i>

02:22.894 --> 02:24.520
- Right away, commissioner.
-No.

02:24.729 --> 02:27.690
No, Batman, wait.
I don't even want us to meet in my office.

02:27.899 --> 02:32.904
Now, if you will go directly to the
Gotham Plaza Hotel, I'll explain further.

02:33.237 --> 02:36.074
- Right.
-Holy cryptology, what was that all about?

02:36.282 --> 02:40.036
I don't know, Dick. The commissioner
is not given to unnecessary alarm.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.080
To the Batpoles.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074

02:51.214 --> 02:52.256
Chief.

02:53.925 --> 02:55.635
You're just in time, Caped Crusader.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.845
Right on the button. Saints be praised.

02:58.054 --> 03:00.139
Better three hours too soon
than a minute late.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.600
Now, what's the crisis, commissioner?

03:03.393 --> 03:04.852
Uh...

03:05.853 --> 03:08.481
Step into the Petit Ballroom.

03:09.565 --> 03:13.236
<i>Happy anniversary to you</i>

03:13.444 --> 03:16.739
<i>Happy anniversary to you</i>

03:16.948 --> 03:20.451
<i>Happy anniversary, Dear Batman</i>

03:20.660 --> 03:24.247
<i>Happy anniversary to you</i>

04:47.580 --> 04:53.211
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests,
Batman and Robin...

04:53.795 --> 04:58.466
...as mayor of Gotham City, it is my privilege
to officiate at this luncheon.

04:58.674 --> 05:04.180
One of many to commemorate a day
cherished in the hearts of all Gothamites.

05:04.388 --> 05:11.229
A day when a man known only as Batman
donned cape and cowl for the first time...

05:11.437 --> 05:15.399
...and appeared in our midst
to preserve law and order.

05:18.694 --> 05:23.616
In appreciation of all the Caped Crusader
has done for our community...

05:23.950 --> 05:27.662
...members of the
Gotham City Dairymen's League...

05:27.870 --> 05:30.581
...have donated $200,000.

05:32.375 --> 05:37.922
Enough new bills, as a matter of fact,
to fill a golden calf.

05:39.173 --> 05:43.094
The proceeds from this luncheon
and others in your honor...

05:43.302 --> 05:46.430
...will be donated to your favorite charity,
Batman.

05:47.223 --> 05:51.102
Ms. Anna Gram, Milkmaid of the Month...

05:51.310 --> 05:54.438
...will make the presentation.
The calf, please.

06:04.073 --> 06:06.075
- Speech. Speech.
-Right, speech.

06:06.284 --> 06:07.994
Speech!

06:09.620 --> 06:11.122
Thank you.

06:11.330 --> 06:14.292
Mayor Linseed,
good citizens of Gotham City...

06:14.500 --> 06:16.752
...I can only state humbly...

06:16.961 --> 06:20.756
...that this is perhaps my finest moment.

06:28.139 --> 06:30.391
Citizens, stay calm.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.519
Make your way to the exits slowly.

06:33.728 --> 06:35.396
Batman, look, the window.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.982
The fire department is here already.

06:38.357 --> 06:40.067
That's what I call fast action.

06:40.276 --> 06:41.861
Almost too fast, Robin.

06:42.069 --> 06:47.033
Have you noticed the lack of flame
in this room and that curious green smoke?

06:50.161 --> 06:53.414
Batman, the firemen are leaving
with the golden calf.

06:53.623 --> 06:56.083
Not firemen, Robin.

06:56.292 --> 06:59.337
The thieves who staged
this flameless inferno.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.005
Let's get them.

07:11.432 --> 07:14.018
- Riddler.
-Salutations and consolations...

07:14.226 --> 07:16.979
...anniversary boy.
-Riddler, that money is for charity.

07:17.188 --> 07:18.981
I'll see that it gets into needy hands.

07:19.190 --> 07:22.151
In the meantime,
I suggest you look for an engaging page...

07:22.360 --> 07:24.820
...to herald the next
of my anniversary surprises.

07:25.029 --> 07:26.489
Ta-ta.

07:31.369 --> 07:32.495
Holy trampoline.

07:32.703 --> 07:36.082
Where did Riddler get a Gotham City
Fire Department rescue truck?

07:36.290 --> 07:39.794
Where he got it is not as important
as where he's going. To the Batmobile.

07:41.921 --> 07:44.048
There's no need for axes. There was no fire.

07:44.256 --> 07:48.427
Merely a well-planned smoke screen
to hide the Riddler's theft of the golden calf.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.180
That enigmatic egotist
back to plague our fair city?

07:51.389 --> 07:53.391
But not for long.

08:36.017 --> 08:38.894
Holy fork in the road. Twin rescue trucks.

08:39.102 --> 08:42.313
One vehicle is set on an evil course,
the other on an errand of mercy.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.984
We can't risk stopping the wrong one.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.986
Luck is no lady today, that's for sure.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.031
Luck generally comes
to those who look for it, Robin.

08:50.239 --> 08:53.617
Riddler rarely leaves anything to chance.

08:54.076 --> 08:55.911
Paper, mister?

08:57.121 --> 08:58.456
Which paper is it?

08:58.664 --> 09:00.207
<i>Gotham City Herald.</i>

09:00.416 --> 09:01.709
Latest edition, 10 cents.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.627
Want one or a bundle?

09:03.836 --> 09:05.671
One, please.

09:06.464 --> 09:08.340
Thanks, pally.

09:09.592 --> 09:12.094
I know it's important to be well-informed,
Batman...

09:12.303 --> 09:14.847
...but don't you think
we should be finding Riddler?

09:15.181 --> 09:16.599
That's exactly what I'm doing.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.060
He suggested we look for
an engaging page...

09:19.268 --> 09:21.771
...to herald the next
of his anniversary surprises.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.647
- Right.
-And what would you call...

09:23.856 --> 09:26.317
...the daily puzzle page
of the Gotham <i>City</i> Herald?

09:26.984 --> 09:28.819
An engaging Page-

09:29.028 --> 09:32.156
- The clue must be somewhere in that puzzle.
-Precisely, Robin.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.283
<i>And since the Gotham City Herald...</i>

09:34.492 --> 09:37.453
...also publishes a morning edition
with this puzzle...

09:37.661 --> 09:41.540
...he would've had time to design his crime
with this puzzle in mind.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.794
What are we waiting for?
Let's solve that puzzle.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.506
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, in his hideout...</i>

09:48.714 --> 09:52.676
<i>...in the soon-to-be-opened
Noman Jigsaw Puzzle Factory...</i>

09:52.885 --> 09:58.557
<i>...the Prince of Puzzlers coaxes his cohorts
in a chorus of praise.</i>

10:00.851 --> 10:03.437
Tell me again, you cringing knaves...

10:03.646 --> 10:05.523
...am I not the king?

10:05.731 --> 10:07.358
You are the king, Riddler.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.735
King, king, king-

10:09.944 --> 10:11.362
Breathes there another mortal...

10:11.570 --> 10:14.865
...who has absconded
with a $200,000 anniversary present...

10:15.074 --> 10:17.993
...from under the cowl
of the Caped Crusader?

10:18.202 --> 10:19.912
No, Riddler, no one.

10:20.121 --> 10:23.749
And who else would be clever enough
to turn in a false fire alarm?

10:23.958 --> 10:27.461
So the real rescue truck
would run interference for my escape.

10:27.670 --> 10:32.925
Ha, ha! What a marvelous piece
of riddling genius that was.

10:33.134 --> 10:35.261
But I've only started
with the Caped Crusaders.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.513
I'm going to confound them
with conundrums...

10:37.721 --> 10:40.349
...unnerve them with enigmas,
perplex them with puzzles...

10:40.558 --> 10:42.518
...until they wish they were dead.

10:42.726 --> 10:43.769
And then what, Riddler?

10:43.978 --> 10:49.441
Then, my jigsaw jackanapes,
then I'll grant their wish.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.280
All right, knaves, follow me.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.157
We have work to do.

10:59.869 --> 11:01.704
Get into these, quickly.

11:01.912 --> 11:04.915
Gee, I wish I were going with you, Riddler.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.544
Your part in our plan is critical,
dear Anna Gram.

11:08.752 --> 11:12.173
Do it well,
and you can help us strike our next blow.

11:12.548 --> 11:13.924
Where are we going, anyway?

11:14.133 --> 11:17.595
We are going to a banquet.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.561
This puzzle's given us
a few minutes of mental exercise...

11:25.769 --> 11:29.273
...but it still has to provide us with a clue
Riddler promised it would.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.651
Well, we've been studying this puzzle
as a puzzle.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.405
I keep thinking about the way you worked
out that pie puzzle this afternoon.

11:36.614 --> 11:38.199
You mean, inductively?

11:38.407 --> 11:39.909
Right.

11:40.117 --> 11:43.078
Across one, "a water utensil."

11:43.287 --> 11:44.371
Answer, "basin."

11:44.580 --> 11:46.707
Down one, "a formal dinner."

11:46.916 --> 11:47.958
Answer, "banquet."

11:48.167 --> 11:50.836
Down three, "a public way."

11:51.045 --> 11:52.213
Answer, "street."

11:52.630 --> 11:55.758
- Down four--
-Wait a minute, Robin.

11:57.343 --> 12:00.971
The Sons of Balboa are having a banquet...

12:01.180 --> 12:04.516
...at the Basin Street Hotel.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.560
And they filled a Spanish chest...

12:06.769 --> 12:10.606
...with $100,000 worth of gold doubloons
to contribute to your favorite charity.

12:10.814 --> 12:13.150
A tempting treasure for that pirate Riddler.

12:14.610 --> 12:15.903
The Batphone.

12:17.863 --> 12:20.157
- What is it, commissioner?
-An alarming incident...

12:20.366 --> 12:22.243
...in our financial district, Batman.

12:22.451 --> 12:26.997
A water main under Matron Lane has burst
and flooded the underground vault...

12:27.206 --> 12:28.582
<i>...of the Gotham City Bank.</i>

12:28.791 --> 12:30.209
A flooded vault.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.877
Or a flooded bank.

12:32.086 --> 12:34.505
A bank wet, Batman.

12:34.713 --> 12:37.800
Commissioner, muster your forces
at the Basin Street Hotel...

12:38.008 --> 12:42.096
...and guard against criminal activity at the
banquet being given by the Sons of Balboa.

12:42.304 --> 12:45.683
- Robin and I will race to Gotham City Bank.
-We'll be there in a trice.

12:47.476 --> 12:50.896
No doubt Riddler intended to divert us
to the wrong banquet.

12:51.105 --> 12:54.817
While he and his vultures no doubt
picked the vault clean at Gotham City Bank.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.652
But underwater?

12:56.860 --> 13:00.197
No doubt a wily ruse of some kind.

13:00.406 --> 13:02.783
We'll need our Batrespirators.

13:02.992 --> 13:04.702
To the Batmobile.

13:07.371 --> 13:10.791
<i>NARRATOR". While the champions of justice
race to the Gotham City Bank...</i>

13:11.000 --> 13:14.920
<i>...the Riddler and his frogmen
are already at work in its watery vault room.</i>

13:15.129 --> 13:19.633
<i>Flooded per their wily ruse
to keep from being followed.</i>

15:46.613 --> 15:48.991
- Worked like a charm, Riddler.
- Why not?

15:49.199 --> 15:51.660
There's a difference
between a Batman and a frogman.

15:51.869 --> 15:55.539
One quick stop
and then let's go dry our money.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.058
Another bulletin from Riddler?

16:15.267 --> 16:17.269
I'm afraid so, Robin.

16:17.478 --> 16:19.354
And look at this.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.484
Only Riddler and his ilk would have such
a flagrant disregard for private property.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.277
This door will have to be repaired.

16:25.486 --> 16:27.946
Not to mention the fortune
he's stolen from the vault.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.616
What does that giggling gorilla
have to say this time?

16:30.824 --> 16:34.077
Another one of his canny conundrums.

16:34.286 --> 16:39.166
"When is a man drowned but still not wet?"

16:44.338 --> 16:48.383
<i>NARRATOR". Back in the soon-to-be-opened
Noman Jigsaw Puzzle Factory...</i>

16:48.592 --> 16:53.263
<i>...the Prince of Puzzlers
tallies his ill-gotten gains.</i>

17:03.232 --> 17:06.818
One million five hundred thousand.

17:07.402 --> 17:10.071
One million five hundred thousand and one.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.491
A million and a half bucks.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.992
I never thought I'd see that much loot
at one time.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.746
Yeah, that's sure a lot of damp dust.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.414
It's only half of what we need.

17:19.623 --> 17:21.250
Well, it's plenty for us, Riddler.

17:21.458 --> 17:25.127
You shallow-brained simpletons,
where's your imagination? Your ambition?

17:25.628 --> 17:27.297
Why do I have to keep reminding you?

17:27.506 --> 17:33.345
Three million dollars will buy us a weapon
so awesome, so destructive, so terrifying...

17:33.554 --> 17:36.974
...the Gotham City fathers
will get down on their miserable knees...

17:37.182 --> 17:39.351
...and offer me anything not to use it.

17:39.977 --> 17:44.690
The entire city will be mine, mine, mine!

17:44.982 --> 17:50.112
Well, I suppose Batman and Robin
are just gonna fold up their capes and retire.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.780
Yeah, what about them, Riddler?

17:51.989 --> 17:56.451
Caped Crusaders will be
wherever it is Caped Crusaders go...

17:56.660 --> 17:57.703
...when they're dead.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.794
That is if you two lackwits
haven't bungled your assignment.

18:06.003 --> 18:08.880
- Well, we did just what you told us, Riddler.
-Without a hitch.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.132
All right, all right.

18:25.564 --> 18:29.276
Professor Avery Evans Charm,
a genius and my friend.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.486
An artful contrivance.

18:31.695 --> 18:32.863
I congratulate you.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.657
A mere toy compared to some
of your devices, professor.

18:35.866 --> 18:39.786
Is your fundraising campaign going well,
Mr. Riddler?

18:39.995 --> 18:41.872
See for yourself.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.334
Beautiful.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.544
I'll say.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.299
- One million five hundred thousand.
-And one.

18:53.467 --> 18:56.970
I can't wait to put my Demolecularizer
in your hands...

18:57.179 --> 19:01.516
...and watch the members
of the Gotham City Science Institute...

19:01.725 --> 19:05.020
...quake at my handiwork.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.606
They still won't let you join, professor?

19:08.398 --> 19:10.400
I'm a high school dropout.

19:11.443 --> 19:13.111
So am I.

19:13.945 --> 19:17.240
Oh. When will you have the $3 million?

19:17.449 --> 19:19.242
You won't be waiting long, professor.

19:19.451 --> 19:23.830
Ere set of sun, all Batman's anniversary
money will be in these two hands.

19:24.039 --> 19:27.417
And the masked man hunters
just an unpleasant memory.

19:34.716 --> 19:38.720
<i>NARRATOR".
When is a man drowned but still not wet?</i>

19:40.389 --> 19:43.225
<i>Unaware of the ghastly fate
that awaits them...</i>

19:43.433 --> 19:49.147
<i>...the Caped Crusaders struggle valiantly
to solve the Riddler's latest conundrum.</i>

19:49.690 --> 19:50.732
Nothing?

19:50.941 --> 19:55.112
Nothing. I'm beginning to think
this riddle doesn't have an answer.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.825
You may be onto something, Robin.

20:00.575 --> 20:03.370
There is a tack we haven't tried yet.

20:06.957 --> 20:09.084
- Uh, begging your pardon, sir.
-Yes, Alfred?

20:09.292 --> 20:12.129
Forgive me for interrupting
your celebration, sir...

20:12.337 --> 20:16.216
...but, uh, I felt that I ought to remind you
of your appointment at the bakery.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.468
- The bakery?
-Yes, sir.

20:18.677 --> 20:21.763
I understand
that the Gotham City Baker's Guild...

20:21.972 --> 20:24.683
...has prepared a rather unique cake
in your honor...

20:25.225 --> 20:27.936
...and wishes you
and Master Robin to, uh, pose...

20:28.145 --> 20:34.151
...for the sculptured, uh, marshmallow figures
of yourselves which will top the confection.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.154
How could I have forgotten?
Thank you, Alfred.

20:37.487 --> 20:38.739
My pleasure, sir.

20:38.947 --> 20:39.990
Let's go, Robin.

20:40.198 --> 20:43.952
We'll continue our attempts to fathom
Riddler's cryptogram while posing.

20:44.161 --> 20:47.831
Right. Change of scenery may turn the trick.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.306
Now, that's what I call a cake.

21:04.514 --> 21:09.352
Yes, it is rather formidable, isn't it?

21:11.354 --> 21:12.856
Batman.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.107
Robin.

21:14.316 --> 21:17.569
Gee, it sure was decent of you fellas
to come all the way down here...

21:17.778 --> 21:19.821
...to pose for your marshmallow statues.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.573
We're flattered we were asked.

21:21.782 --> 21:22.949
Oh, it was nothing.

21:23.158 --> 21:26.787
Now, you're probably in a rush to get
to your Gotham Square Park appointment...

21:26.995 --> 21:29.164
...so I'll be just as fast as I can.

21:29.372 --> 21:32.000
Now, all you have to do
is go up to the top of the cake...

21:32.209 --> 21:35.003
...and you stand in the center
with your hands at your sides.

21:35.212 --> 21:37.964
It doesn't take long to carve marshmallows.

21:39.090 --> 21:42.177
That's the second appointment
we've forgotten today, Robin...

21:42.385 --> 21:44.763
...the final ceremony at Gotham Square Park.

21:44.971 --> 21:49.226
In which the funds accumulated in our honor
will be turned over to our favorite charity.

21:49.434 --> 21:52.521
Riddler's latest brain twister
has us both dizzy.

21:52.729 --> 21:53.897
Breathe deeply.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.650
Perhaps a breath of fresh air
will clear our minds.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.656
Here we go, Batman.

22:45.866 --> 22:47.242
We're sinking, Batman.

22:47.450 --> 22:51.288
Congratulations, Bat brain,
you've risen to the occasion.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.790
Can't get my feet out of this.
It's like quicksand.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.083
It is quicksand, Robin.

22:55.292 --> 22:59.462
Riddler's own prepared mix,
cleverly disguised as strawberry icing.

22:59.671 --> 23:03.717
That's right, you sinking saps.
Quicksand, 15 feet of it.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.802
Call it an anniversary present.

23:06.094 --> 23:07.596
That scurvy fiend.

23:07.804 --> 23:12.142
Sorry I can't stay around to see you
descend into oblivion, pastry faces...

23:13.602 --> 23:17.647
...but I have an appointment to keep
with some money at Gotham Square Park.

23:17.856 --> 23:20.442
<i>Happy</i> anniversary to you

23:20.650 --> 23:23.236
<i>Happy anniversary to you</i>

23:23.445 --> 23:26.281
<i>Happy anniversary, dear Batman</i>

23:26.489 --> 23:27.532
Ta-ta.

23:27.741 --> 23:30.785
<i>Happy anniversary to you</i>

23:32.829 --> 23:37.292
I did think it would all end differently,
somehow less ignominiously.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.295
To drown in my own anniversary cake...

23:40.503 --> 23:42.088
Drown? But in quicksand?

23:42.672 --> 23:47.052
Yes, old chum.
Death in quicksand is technically drowning.

23:47.385 --> 23:48.845
That's it, Batman.

23:49.054 --> 23:51.348
- What, Robin?
-The answer to the riddle.

23:51.556 --> 23:55.644
When is a man drowned but still not wet?

23:55.852 --> 23:58.313
We'll be drowned,
but in quicksand so we won't get wet.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.649
Excellent. You've done it again.

24:00.857 --> 24:03.777
Mm-hm. Lot of good it'll do us now, though.
