WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.504
OH, HEY.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.006
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, ANGIE?
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.808
YOU SHOULDN'T BE CARRYING THAT.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.578
YOU GOT MY SPECIAL LITTLE LOPEZ
IN THERE.

00:10.578 --> 00:13.947
I WAS JUST BRINGING
DOWN CARMEN'S CARE
PACKAGE FOR COLLEGE.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.716
I TOLD YOU
I WAS GONNA SEND IT TODAY.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.986
I KNOW. I GOT HER ONE OF
THOSE TALKING BEARS, ANGIE.

00:18.986 --> 00:21.689
I RECORDED
A MESSAGE FOR HER.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.424
AW, THAT'S SWEET.

00:23.424 --> 00:26.327
YOU'RE GETTING SENTIMENTAL
IN YOUR OLD AGE.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.229
"Ã³RALE, FRAT BOY.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.432
"IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS MESSAGE,
YOU'RE ON MY DAUGHTER'S BED,

00:31.432 --> 00:34.135
AND I'M ON MY WAY TO KILL YOU."

00:34.135 --> 00:36.137
CHECK OUT HIS LITTLE BASKET.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.439
I PUT SOME MACE IN THERE.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.410
GEORGE, IT HASN'T
EVEN BEEN THAT LONG,

00:42.410 --> 00:43.944
AND I ALREADY
MISS CARMEN SO MUCH.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.580
I KNOW. I MISS HER TOO.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.816
TILL THE BABY GETS HERE,
IT'S GONNA BE REAL QUIET.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.819
I GUESS THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL
AN EMPTY NEST.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.020
I'M STILL HERE.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.756
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT INTERRUPTING?

00:55.756 --> 00:58.058
BUT YOU CAN'T
HAVE AN EMPTY NEST

00:58.058 --> 00:59.793
IF YOU STILL
HAVE A KID HERE.

00:59.793 --> 01:03.197
YEAH, BUT CARMEN'S LEAVING
HAS BEEN TOO PAINFUL FOR ME,

01:03.197 --> 01:04.998
SO Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
I'VE DECIDED THAT

01:04.998 --> 01:08.802
IT'S BETTER FOR ME IF I DISTANCE
MYSELF FROM... (whistles)

01:10.838 --> 01:13.741
I WON'T BE GOING TO COLLEGE
FOR AT LEAST THREE MORE YEARS.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.310
THAT'S VERY OPTIMISTIC,
YOUNG MAN.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.412
I HOPE YOUR PARENTS
HAVE PUT AWAY SOME MONEY.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.848
COLLEGE. ESTÃ¡ LOCO. COLLEGE.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.316
(telephone rings)

01:23.851 --> 01:26.420
HELLO?

01:26.420 --> 01:29.390
YES, I'LL ACCEPT
THE CHARGES.
WHO IS IT?

01:29.390 --> 01:32.626
I KNEW I'D SAY THIS
AT SOME POINT IN OUR MARRIAGE.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.762
IT'S YOUR MOTHER
CALLING FROM JAIL.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.567
MOM?

01:39.567 --> 01:42.403
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SEND ME
A HOLLOWED-OUT BIBLE

01:42.403 --> 01:44.638
FILLED WITH CIGARETTES.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.175
MOM, I'M WORKING ON IT,
ALL RIGHT?

01:47.175 --> 01:49.910
I WAS CUTTING UP THE BIBLE
LAST NIGHT,

01:49.910 --> 01:51.712
BUT THEN I STARTED READING IT.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.682
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT
OF CRAZY STUFF IN THERE,

01:54.682 --> 01:57.518
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
IT'S GOT, LIKE, A MESSAGE.

01:57.518 --> 02:00.154
JUST MAIL IT, GEORGE.
I NEED MY NICOTINE.

02:00.154 --> 02:02.223
AND ALSO I LOOK TOUGHER

02:02.223 --> 02:04.858
WITH A CIGARETTE
HANGING OUT OF MY MOUTH.

02:06.694 --> 02:09.697
I NEED TO LOOK TOUGHER HERE,
GEORGE.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.966
GIVE ME THE PHONE!

02:12.966 --> 02:16.003
DON'T YOU MESS WITH ME, HUH?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:16.003 --> 02:19.973
I STABBED A BABY
FOR CRYING IN A MOVIE THEATER.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.775
THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH, RIGHT.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.278
I HEARD YOU ACCIDENTALLY
DROVE A GETAWAY CAR,

02:24.278 --> 02:26.113
LIKE, 30 YEARS AGO.

02:26.113 --> 02:27.848
WHAT ARE YOU IN HERE FOR?

02:27.848 --> 02:30.351
FOR BEATING
AN OLD MEXICAN LADY TO DEATH

02:30.351 --> 02:32.820
WITH A PAY PHONE.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.358
YOUR TURN.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.766
THAT WAS FAST.
HOW'S YOUR MOM?

02:45.766 --> 02:47.768
SHE SOUNDED
LONELY AND SCARED.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.404
IF SUPERMAN THROWS HER
INTO THE SUN,

02:50.404 --> 02:53.541
IT'LL BE MY EXACT BIRTHDAY WISH
FROM WHEN I WAS 9.

02:56.210 --> 02:59.012
THIS CAME FOR YOU.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.582
"CLASSICAL FETAL FAVORITES"?

03:01.582 --> 03:04.752
I HEARD IF YOU PLAY CLASSICAL
MUSIC TO THE BABY IN THE WOMB,

03:04.752 --> 03:05.886
IT COMES OUT SMARTER.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.589
THE ONLY THING I HEARD
IN MY MOM'S WOMB WAS,

03:08.589 --> 03:10.958
"I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE
DRINKING FOR TWO, LADY,

03:10.958 --> 03:12.893
LAST CALL IS LAST CALL."

03:14.762 --> 03:17.231
CAN YOU PLAY THIS ONE
BY MOZART?

03:17.231 --> 03:21.201
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU'RE NOT NEGATIVE.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.772
"D FLAT...

03:24.772 --> 03:29.843
MINOR SUSPENDED 4."

03:29.843 --> 03:32.045
(plays flat chord)

03:32.045 --> 03:35.916
YOU KNOW WHAT, ANGIE?
I KNOW ANOTHER CLASSIC.

03:35.916 --> 03:39.387
* SHE'S A VERY KINKY GIRL

03:40.921 --> 03:45.025
* THE KIND YOU DON'T
TAKE HOME TO MOTHER *

03:45.025 --> 03:49.297
* SHE'S A SUPER FREAK

03:49.297 --> 03:51.299
* SUPER FREAK

03:51.299 --> 03:54.067
* SHE'S SUPER FREAKY, YOW

03:54.067 --> 03:57.271
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
UH, GEORGE,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.807
I HAVE TO TALK TO MY DAD
ABOUT SOMETHING.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.810
NO PROBLEM, 'CAUSE I GOTTA LOOK
UP THE LYRICS ONLINE ANYWAYS.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.646
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT GETTING
FREAKY WITH A BUNCH OF GUYS

04:05.646 --> 04:08.582
IN A HOTEL ROOM, AND I WANT
TO GET IT RIGHT FOR THE BABY.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.984
MAYBE YOU CAN FIND
A BETTER SONG.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.587
MOM, CAN I GO TO A PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.556
I'M BUSY. ASK YOUR FATHER.

04:15.556 --> 04:19.092
DAD, CAN I GO TO A PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT?
I'M BUSY. ASK YOUR MOTHER.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.894
WELL, SINCE NOBODY CARES,

04:20.894 --> 04:25.633
I'M GONNA GO TO A PARTY
WITH OLDER KIDS AND DRINKING.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.635
HEY, Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
KNOCK IT OFF, MUMBLES.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.804
MAN, I'M TRYING TO FIND
A SONG TO SING TO THE BABY.

04:30.804 --> 04:35.275
LET'S SEE.
MUSIC... BABY... WOMB.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.579
Ã³RALE. THAT'S NOT IT.

04:41.081 --> 04:44.418
MY GOD,
LOOK AT THAT THING.
WHAT IS THAT?

04:44.418 --> 04:47.120
THAT'S A 3-D ULTRASOUND.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.924
YOU CAN SEE THE EYELASHES
AND--AND EVERYTHING.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.226
THAT THING'S IN MOM?

04:53.226 --> 04:55.763
GROSS!
IT LOOKS LIKE AN ALIEN.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.766
THAT'S YOUR REACTION BECAUSE
Â¿SABES QUÃ©? YOU'RE A CHILD.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.701
WHEN YOU'RE AN ADULT
LIKE ME,

05:00.701 --> 05:02.903
YOU'LL REALIZE
THAT THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

05:02.903 --> 05:06.039
IT'S THE MIRACLE OF--
OH! THE ALIEN MOVED.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.078
WHY WAS GEORGE
SINGING TO YOUR STOMACH?

05:11.078 --> 05:14.014
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOUR
PREGNANCY WAS A FALSE ALARM.

05:14.014 --> 05:17.518
SHH! IT--IT WAS, BUT...

05:17.518 --> 05:19.820
HE GOT SO EXCITED
ABOUT HAVING THE BABY,

05:19.820 --> 05:22.490
I DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART
TO TELL HIM.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.793
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
NINE MONTHS FROM NOW?

05:25.793 --> 05:27.961
HAND GEORGE A BASKETBALL
WRAPPED IN A BLANKET

05:27.961 --> 05:31.799
AND SAY, "LOOK,
HE'S GOT YOUR HEAD"?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.235
I'VE GOT A PLAN.

05:35.235 --> 05:38.672
IF I GET PREGNANT RIGHT AWAY,
GEORGE WILL NEVER KNOW.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.808
AT YOUR AGE,
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.976
WELL, I'M OVULATING
THIS WEEKEND.

05:42.976 --> 05:46.079
I'M NOT LETTING HIM OUT OF THAT
BEDROOM TILL I'M KNOCKED UP.

05:46.079 --> 05:50.050
AH, TO THINK
I USED TO SPOON APPLESAUCE

05:50.050 --> 05:52.586
INTO THAT POTTY MOUTH.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.823
I'M SORRY.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.859
I'M DESPERATE. I DON'T WANT
GEORGE TO KNOW THAT I LIED.

05:58.859 --> 06:02.095
I THOUGHT I RAISED YOU
TO VALUE HONESTY.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.064
REALLY?

06:04.064 --> 06:08.536
HAVE YOU TOLD YOUR 27-YEAR-OLD
FIANCÃ©E HOW OLD YOU ARE?

06:08.536 --> 06:11.872
WELL, MY BIRTH RECORDS
ARE STILL IN CUBA,

06:11.872 --> 06:15.643
SO IT IS WITHIN THE REALM
OF POSSIBILITY THAT I'M 49.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.847
OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.

06:19.847 --> 06:23.684
YOU DON'T TELL GEORGE.
I DON'T TELL LINDSAY.

06:23.684 --> 06:27.421
FINE, BUT YOU ALSO
HAVE TO BACK ME UP

06:27.421 --> 06:30.491
THAT MY LAST GIRLFRIEND
WAS SHAKIRA...

06:32.693 --> 06:36.664
AND "HIPS DON'T LIE"
IS ABOUT ME.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.906
ANGIE, HAVE YOU SEEN
THESE 3-D SONOGRAMS?

06:45.906 --> 06:48.542
THEY'RE NOT LIKE
THE ONES THAT THEY HAD

06:48.542 --> 06:50.544
WHEN CARMEN AND MAX
WERE BORN.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.980
THERE'S...
A LOT OF DETAIL THERE.

06:52.980 --> 06:58.085
YEAH, I KNOW.
THEY'RE AMAZING.

07:01.388 --> 07:05.292
SO...
YOU WANNA GO UPSTAIRS?

07:05.292 --> 07:07.194
YOU CAN BRING YOUR GUITAR.

07:07.194 --> 07:13.000
I'LL DO ANYTHING I HAVE TO
TO GET BACKSTAGE.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.468
NAH, NO, THANKS.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.605
I GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO
DOWN HERE.

07:23.844 --> 07:27.548
WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO GO UPSTAIRS.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.150
WE'RE ALL ALONE.

07:30.150 --> 07:34.054
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

07:41.394 --> 07:44.898
NOT REALLY.

07:44.898 --> 07:48.035
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

07:51.071 --> 07:54.207
* ALL MY FRIENDS

07:54.207 --> 07:55.776
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

08:06.920 --> 08:09.189
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE CHEAP,
DUDE. YOU MAKE A GOOD LIVING.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.391
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR
THAT THING. I DON'T WANNA--

08:11.391 --> 08:12.392
OH, MAN!

08:12.392 --> 08:13.694
WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

08:13.694 --> 08:16.830
LOOK AT ANGIE.
SHE'S IN THE MOOD AGAIN.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.832
EVER SINCE
SHE'S BEEN PREGNANT, MAN,

08:18.832 --> 08:20.834
HER HORMONES
ARE GOING CRAZY.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.737
SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET ME
IN BED ALL WEEKEND.

08:23.737 --> 08:28.508
ANY OTHER PROBLEMS?

08:28.508 --> 08:31.511
TOO MUCH MONEY?
YOUR HOUSE TOO NICE?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.481
HOW CAN I HELP YOU, GEORGE?

08:34.481 --> 08:35.883
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?!

08:35.883 --> 08:40.153
I SAW ONE OF
THOSE 3-D SONOGRAMS, MAN,

08:40.153 --> 08:42.856
AND NOW I CAN'T BE
WITH ANGIE,

08:42.856 --> 08:45.559
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
I LOOK AT HER BELLY

08:45.559 --> 08:48.061
I SEE A LITTLE FACE
IN THERE SAYING,

08:48.061 --> 08:52.566
"KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS, VATO.
I LIVEHERE."

08:55.302 --> 08:58.606
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ANGIE
THAT IT BOTHERS YOU?

08:58.606 --> 09:01.074
NO, MAN,
BECAUSE THEN SHE'S GONNA THINK

09:01.074 --> 09:03.076
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH HER,
OR SHE'S UGLY,

09:03.076 --> 09:05.078
AND THEN IT BECOMES
A WHOLE BIG THING.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.948
WELL, YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT
IT WAS IMPORTANT

09:07.948 --> 09:09.449
FOR COUPLES TO COMMUNICATE.

09:09.449 --> 09:13.020
NO. YOU DON'T COMMUNICATE.

09:13.020 --> 09:16.523
THAT WAY,
YOU NEVER HURT SOMEBODY.
OH.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.158
YOU SEE,
I LOVE ANGIE SO MUCH

09:18.158 --> 09:20.661
THAT I DON'T
TELL HER NOTHING.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.865
SORRY, ERNIE. YOU GUYS
CAN'T HANG OUT TONIGHT.

09:24.865 --> 09:30.470
GEORGE HAS
A LOT OF CHORES TO DO.

09:30.470 --> 09:34.274
(laughs)

09:34.274 --> 09:36.910
AND YOU THOUGHT
SHE WANTED TO DO IT.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.649
THE JOKE'S ON YOU. Ã¡NDALE.
YOU GOTTA GO DO YOUR CHORES.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.817
LET'S GO. Ã¡NDALE.

09:43.817 --> 09:46.654
AND DON'T FORGET
TO FEED THE CATS!

09:51.959 --> 09:54.461
HEY, ANGIE,
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,

09:54.461 --> 09:58.732
OH, I JUST GOTTA TELL YOU
THAT I AM BEAT. GOOD NIGHT.

10:01.134 --> 10:05.238
WELL, MAYBE I HAVE A SURPRISE
THAT'LL WAKE YOU UP.

10:05.238 --> 10:09.042
I MADE A LITTLE TRIP
TO THE LOVE BOUTIQUE.

10:11.779 --> 10:15.348
IS THAT WHAT IT'S COME TO,
ANGIE? DEVICES?

10:17.284 --> 10:19.186
I'M NOT MAN ENOUGH ANYMORE?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:19.186 --> 10:22.389
IT'S GONNA BE MONTHS
BEFORE I GET OVER THIS.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.892
BOUTIQUE OF LOVE.

10:24.892 --> 10:28.662
DON'T BE SILLY.
I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

10:28.662 --> 10:32.365
I JUST GOT
SOME MASSAGE OILS.

10:33.901 --> 10:37.971
THIS ONE HEATS UP
WHEN YOU BLOW ON IT.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.419
NOPE! NOTHING.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.657
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,

10:57.657 --> 11:00.160
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN
AVOIDING ME ALL WEEKEND.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.362
NO MORE EXCUSES.
GET UPSTAIRS.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.664
WE'RE DOING THIS, ALICE.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.470
EXCUSE ME. MAY I OPEN
THE DOOR UNMOLESTED?

11:10.470 --> 11:12.039
THANK YOU, MADAME.

11:16.543 --> 11:20.748
ANGIE. GEORGE.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.423
I WANT YOU TO MEET
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

11:30.423 --> 11:32.525
MY FIANCÃ©E LINDSAY.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.962
I HEARD VIC'S VOICE,

11:34.962 --> 11:38.832
BUT IT CAME
OUT OF BON JOVI'S GRANDFATHER.

11:40.934 --> 11:44.237
IT IS SO AWESOME
TO FINALLY MEET YOU, ANGIE.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.473
IT'S... AWESOME
TO MEET YOU, TOO.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.275
WE CAME BY TO SEE IF YOU GUYS

11:48.275 --> 11:50.944
WANTED TO GO CLUBBING
WITH US LATER.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.946
YEAH, WE KNOW
THE BARTENDER.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.115
HE GIVES US FREE DRINKS.

11:55.115 --> 11:59.052
YEAH? DOES HE GIVE YOU
ANOTHER GLASS FOR YOUR DENTURES?

12:01.321 --> 12:05.292
YOU WON'T BE JOKING LIKE THAT
WHEN YOU SEE MY MOVES.

12:09.830 --> 12:13.066
AY, PAPI.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.370
AY, CREEPY.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.406
YOU KNOW WHAT, DADDY?
DADDY.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.707
YEAH, MY DEAR?

12:20.707 --> 12:23.210
UH, WHY DON'T WE
JUST GO TO DINNER

12:23.210 --> 12:26.379
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER?
CHOOSE A PLACE,

12:26.379 --> 12:29.516
AND GEORGE AND I WILL MEET YOU
THERE IN HALF AN HOUR.

12:29.516 --> 12:33.186
GEORGE, I'LL BE UPSTAIRS.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.889
WE TOOK VOWS.
YOU HAVE A DUTY.

12:40.127 --> 12:44.364
COME ON, LINDSAY. WHAT DO YOU
FEEL LIKE EATING?
I FEEL LIKE SUSHI TONIGHT.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.334
OH, NO, LINDSAY. ANGIE CAN'T
HAVE RAW FISH. SHE'S PREGNANT.

12:47.334 --> 12:50.303
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
SHE WASN'T PREGNANT.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.839
WHAT, NOT PREGNANT?
WHAT...

12:51.839 --> 12:55.042
NO. NO, OF COURSE
ANGIE'S PREGNANT.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.077
NO, HONEY, I WAS
TELLING YOU A FUNNY STORY

12:57.077 --> 12:59.379
THAT WAS UNRELATED TO ANGIE
BEING PREGNANT, WHICH SHE IS.

12:59.379 --> 13:03.150
I'LL TELL YOU MORE OVER DINNER,
AND WE'RE WALKING.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.886
VIC!
IN A HURRY.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.387
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:07.387 --> 13:09.957
WHY DID SHE SAY
THAT ANGIE'S NOT PREGNANT?

13:09.957 --> 13:14.294
OH, THIS IS WHAT
HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT.

13:17.097 --> 13:21.468
I MADE ANOTHER MESS, PAPI.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.204
I'LL CLEAN IT UP, EH?

13:24.204 --> 13:25.973
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT
IN THE CAR?

13:25.973 --> 13:28.641
I CALL DEEJAY,
BUT I WON'T PLAY SHAKIRA.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.344
I KNOW HOW THAT HURTS.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.318
TALK.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.553
THIS IS
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR WIFE.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.256
TELL ME ABOUT ANGIE
BEFORE I KILL YOU

13:43.256 --> 13:46.159
BY CLOSING THE TOP BUTTON
ON THOSE JEANS.

13:48.095 --> 13:51.031
GEORGE, I DON'T WANT
TO GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.600
YOU ALREADY ARE, MAN.
IS SHE PREGNANT OR NOT?

13:53.600 --> 13:56.970
NO.

13:56.970 --> 14:00.007
SHE LIED TO ME,
AND YOU KNEW ABOUT IT?

14:00.007 --> 14:02.976
GEORGE, I TRIED
TO KEEP YOU FROM MARRYING HER,

14:02.976 --> 14:05.345
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN.

14:05.345 --> 14:10.583
NO, YOU TRIED TO KEEP HER
FROM MARRYING ME.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.385
SHE TOLD YOU THAT?

14:12.385 --> 14:16.123
WELL, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
SHE'S A LIAR.

14:30.737 --> 14:33.974
IS EVERYONE GONE?

14:33.974 --> 14:37.777
YEAH, IT'S JUST US.

14:37.777 --> 14:42.983
WOW, LOOK AT YOU
IN THAT ROBE.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.517
YOU LIKE?

14:44.517 --> 14:45.718
YEAH.

14:45.718 --> 14:49.156
LOOK AT YOUR TUMMY.
YOU'RE ALREADY SHOWING.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.932
NO, I'M NOT.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.101
YEAH, YOU ARE!

15:01.101 --> 15:06.039
YOU'RE GETTING
THAT LITTLE BELLY ROLL.

15:06.039 --> 15:09.542
THIS BABY'S GONNA BE HUGE.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.311
STOP IT.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.513
I HAVEN'T
GAINED ANY WEIGHT.

15:13.513 --> 15:17.384
SURE YOU HAVE. YOU CAN SEE IT
IN YOUR FACE, TOO.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.718
NO WAY.

15:18.718 --> 15:22.022
ANGIE, RELAX! IT'S NATURAL
THAT YOUR BODY CHANGES.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.024
THERE'S NO REASON
TO BE UPSET, YOU KNOW,

15:24.024 --> 15:26.059
UNLESS, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT.

15:26.059 --> 15:29.129
WHA--WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:29.129 --> 15:32.565
YOU TELL ME WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT, LIAR! BABY FAKER!

15:36.169 --> 15:37.837
MY DAD TOLD YOU?

15:37.837 --> 15:41.341
ANGIE, HOW COULD YOU LIE TO ME
ABOUT SOMETHING THIS SERIOUS?

15:41.341 --> 15:43.576
THE TEST
WAS A FALSE POSITIVE,

15:43.576 --> 15:47.247
BUT I SAW HOW EXCITED YOU WERE
ABOUT HAVING A BABY

15:47.247 --> 15:50.183
AND HOW DEPRESSED YOU WERE
ABOUT CARMEN GOING AWAY,

15:50.183 --> 15:52.085
I FIGURED I COULD
GET PREGNANT QUICKLY,

15:52.085 --> 15:53.520
AND EVERYTHING
WOULD BE FINE,

15:53.520 --> 15:56.356
BUT YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE SEX WITH ME.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.261
I SAW THAT NEW 3-D SONOGRAM
ON THE COMPUTER,

16:01.261 --> 16:03.263
AND IT FREAKED ME OUT.

16:03.263 --> 16:07.600
WHY WOULD THAT
FREAK YOU OUT?

16:07.600 --> 16:10.070
BECAUSE THERE'S
A LITTLE PERSON IN THERE.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.105
I DON'T WANT
TO TURN YOUR WOMB

16:12.105 --> 16:14.574
INTO AN X-RATED
BOUNCY HOUSE.

16:21.681 --> 16:25.852
WELL, I'M NOT PREGNANT,

16:25.852 --> 16:28.055
BUT I AM OVULATING.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.823
HELLO.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.761
NOW'S A CHANCE TO HAVE
OUR FIRST PLANNED CHILD.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.200
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.102
(telephone rings)

16:44.871 --> 16:46.806
HELLO?

16:46.806 --> 16:50.110
WHAT? WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?
IS HE OKAY?

16:50.110 --> 16:52.312
WE'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.
WHAT IS IT?

16:52.312 --> 16:55.715
MAX IS IN THE HOSPITAL. THEY
WON'T TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.685
GO GET THE CAR.
I'LL GO CHANGE.
WHERE WAS HE TONIGHT?

16:58.685 --> 17:01.688
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.
HOW COULD I KNOW?

17:01.688 --> 17:04.424
I SPENT THE LAST TWO DAYS
FIGHTING YOU OFF,

17:04.424 --> 17:07.560
WITH YOUR JOY JELLIES
AND YOUR HEAT CREAMS. COCHINA.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.570
IS MAX LOPEZ IN THERE?
WE'RE HIS PARENTS.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.372
YES. HE'S OKAY.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.641
WE TREATED HIM
FOR ALCOHOL POISONING.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.843
WHAT?
SO DID YOU
PUMP HIS STOMACH?

17:23.843 --> 17:25.345
FILL HIM WITH CHARCOAL,

17:25.345 --> 17:27.447
GIVE HIM A SALINE DRIP
TO KEEP HIM HYDRATED?

17:27.447 --> 17:31.584
YES. ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
NO, MAN. WHEN I WAS A KID,
I USED TO BRING MY MOM IN HERE

17:31.584 --> 17:34.387
FOR STOMACH PUMPINGS,
LIKE, TWICE A MONTH.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.757
WELL, MAYBE YOUR MOTHER'S
A BAD INFLUENCE ON YOUR SON.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.493
I DOUBT IT. SHE'S IN JAIL.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.432
MAX, HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

17:45.432 --> 17:48.101
YEAH. I'M SO SORRY.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.270
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:50.270 --> 17:52.105
I WAS AT THIS PARTY,
AND I MET THIS GIRL.

17:52.105 --> 17:55.508
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DRINK ALONE,
SO I SAID I'D DRINK WITH HER,

17:55.508 --> 17:58.010
AND IT WAS STUFF
I NEVER TRIED BEFORE.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.680
WHAT HAVE YOU TRIED?

18:00.680 --> 18:05.952
JUST BEER AND WHATEVER ELSE
YOU GUYS KEEP IN THE HOUSE.

18:05.952 --> 18:09.422
YOU DRANK IN THE HOUSE?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.191
WHAT DID YOU HAVE
AT THE PARTY?

18:11.191 --> 18:13.426
GRAIN ALCOHOL.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.429
Ã³RALE, JETHRO!
THAT STUFF CAN KILL YOU.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.599
THEY PUT IT IN FRUIT PUNCH.

18:19.599 --> 18:23.570
OH, WELL, IF YOU'RE GETTING
YOUR VITAMIN C, THEN IT'S OKAY.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.872
I FEEL HORRIBLE.

18:25.872 --> 18:29.609
I GUESS THIS IS
MY PUNISHMENT FOR DRINKING.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.482
YOUR PUNISHMENT
HASN'T EVEN STARTED YET.

18:35.482 --> 18:39.051
YOU'RE LOSING VIDEO GAMES,
THE TV, THE COMPUTER Y TODO.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.687
IT'S AMISH TIME
FOR YOU, FOOL.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.790
I THINK
I'M GONNA BE SICK AGAIN.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.832
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE WAS DRINKING AT HOME,

18:52.832 --> 18:54.834
AND WE DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.603
THIS IS MY FAULT.

18:56.603 --> 18:59.606
MY MOM'S IN JAIL,
BUT MY BEERS KEPT DISAPPEARING.

18:59.606 --> 19:02.375
I SHOULD HAVE
PUT IT TOGETHER.

19:04.444 --> 19:07.447
WE WERE SO CAUGHT UP
IN MISSING CARMEN

19:07.447 --> 19:09.549
AND PREPARING
FOR THE NEW BABY,

19:09.549 --> 19:12.619
WE HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING
ENOUGH ATTENTION TO MAX.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.822
WE BETTER START.
HE'S 15 AND DRINKING, ANGIE.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.157
NEXT YEAR, HE'LL BE DRIVING.
(sighs)

19:18.157 --> 19:21.528
WE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO
WITH THIS ONE.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.832
ARE WE CRAZY
TO WANT TO DO THIS AGAIN?

19:25.832 --> 19:28.668
MAYBE.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.372
BECAUSE IF WE DO
HAVE A BABY,

19:32.372 --> 19:34.507
IT'S GONNA
TURN INTO A TEENAGER,

19:34.507 --> 19:36.643
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT TO BE IN MY 40s,

19:36.643 --> 19:41.614
GETTING CALLS FROM
THE EMERGENCY ROOM. (sighs)

19:41.614 --> 19:42.549
40s?

19:47.487 --> 19:50.623
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.895
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

19:55.895 --> 19:58.865
LOOK, MAYBE PART OF THE REASON
I WANTED A BABY SO BAD

19:58.865 --> 20:01.368
WAS BECAUSE I MISSED CARMEN,

20:01.368 --> 20:04.371
BUT I'M STARTING
TO GET OVER HER.

20:04.371 --> 20:09.175
SO... FOR NOW,

20:09.175 --> 20:11.911
YOU OKAY
WITH NO MORE KIDS?

20:11.911 --> 20:16.916
(Max retches loudly)

20:16.916 --> 20:19.486
YEAH, I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

20:23.956 --> 20:28.861
YEAH, THE CIGARETTES
JUST GOT HERE.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.463
REALLY?

20:30.463 --> 20:32.499
ALCOHOL POISONING.

20:32.499 --> 20:36.202
BOY, DOES THAT SOUND GOOD
RIGHT NOW.

20:36.202 --> 20:39.005
ALL RIGHT. LATER.

20:39.005 --> 20:43.510
OH, I MISSED YOU.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!

20:43.510 --> 20:47.514
SWEET. THAT'S MY BRAND.

20:47.514 --> 20:51.951
I HAVE TAKEN ENOUGH
OF YOUR CRAP.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.620
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.622
NO, YOU'RE MAKING
A BIG MISTAKE.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.190
I HAVEN'T HAD A SMOKE
IN FOUR DAYS.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.926
YOU TOUCH MY CIGARETTES,

20:59.926 --> 21:02.562
AND YOU'LL BE
IN A WORLD OF PAIN.

21:07.199 --> 21:10.370
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
A PRESSURE POINT HERE

21:10.370 --> 21:12.672
THAT IS VERY SENSITIVE.

21:12.672 --> 21:17.009
OKAY, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN
A LOT OF PAIN RIGHT NOW, BOY.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.615
I'LL GET YOU SOME MATCHES.
