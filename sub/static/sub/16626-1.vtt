03:04.600 --> 03:09.980
Well, Miss Timberlake, back again
for a little of the taxpayers' money, hmm?

03:14.746 --> 03:17.031
- So did you work last week?
- No.

03:17.131 --> 03:19.161
- Are you available for work?
- Yes.

03:19.261 --> 03:21.290
- Did you turn down any jobs?
- No.

03:21.390 --> 03:24.298
- Are you busy tonight?
- Yes.

03:24.398 --> 03:27.804
If, in our opinion,
the applicant hasn't exercised

03:27.904 --> 03:30.766
proper diligence in seeking employment,

03:30.866 --> 03:33.314
we can withhold payment of cheques.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.445
Perhaps tomorrow night?

03:35.545 --> 03:40.246
There's a wonderful little diner
round the corner from where I live

03:40.346 --> 03:43.214
and after dinner we could, uh, well...

03:44.307 --> 03:48.059
...perhaps...
- Go up to your apartment?

03:50.695 --> 03:54.563
- Well, I, uh...
- If you want me to go up to your apartment

03:54.663 --> 03:59.328
come out and ask. That way I can
think about it and make a decision.

04:00.465 --> 04:03.005
Would you like to stop off at my place?

04:04.556 --> 04:07.477
- May I have my cheque?
- Oh. Of course.

04:17.916 --> 04:18.916
Well?

04:19.880 --> 04:22.960
I would enjoy going out with you,
Mr Beasley,

04:23.060 --> 04:26.259
if I didn't find you so personally distasteful.

04:28.063 --> 04:31.265
You're a sneaky, crude, offensive man.

04:31.365 --> 04:33.397
That's just how I feel.

04:33.497 --> 04:37.873
I'm sure there are hundreds of girls
who admire those qualities.

04:39.712 --> 04:41.747
I circled the entire area, sir.

04:41.847 --> 04:45.095
- There's no sign of her.
- Darn. Thank you, Collins.

04:47.186 --> 04:52.099
Hit and run's a dangerous sport, Mr Shayne,
even for the privileged class.

04:52.199 --> 04:56.109
Even if this victim survives,
what can she do? Sue you?

04:56.209 --> 05:01.117
With your money, you can run down half
the girls in New York and still be solvent.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.417
We hit a puddle, splashed the girl.

05:03.517 --> 05:06.257
Would you have me stop, tie up the traffic,

05:06.357 --> 05:09.513
crawl through the rain
and beg forgiveness?

05:09.613 --> 05:13.103
A decent gesture like that
would never occur to you.

05:13.203 --> 05:16.899
So I'll set up a foundation
for waterlogged girls.

05:16.999 --> 05:19.616
Isn't it a little early for cocktails?

05:19.716 --> 05:22.246
I'm perfectly aware of what I'm doing.

05:22.346 --> 05:24.960
- I have an analyst. Dr Gruber.
- I know.

05:25.060 --> 05:29.801
A distinguished analyst. I know exactly
what started me drinking at this hour.

05:29.901 --> 05:32.850
- What?
- Dr Gruber, he's a lush.

05:32.950 --> 05:35.649
Seven years of treating you could do it.

05:35.749 --> 05:37.779
- Yeah.
- Look out.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.203
- He's a brilliant man. Brilliant.
- Brilliant.

05:41.303 --> 05:45.421
He put his finger right on my problem -
my lack of integrity.

05:45.521 --> 05:49.760
You were a humble but respected
professor of economics at Princeton.

05:49.860 --> 05:52.936
Students sat at my feet
absorbing my wisdom.

05:53.036 --> 05:55.270
The lvy League Socrates.

05:55.370 --> 05:59.069
Then you came along
dangling $50,000 a year under my nose

05:59.169 --> 06:01.869
and, to my everlasting shame, I sold out.

06:01.969 --> 06:05.833
And every year you further humiliate me
by raising my salary.

06:05.933 --> 06:09.261
Inexcusable.
Like rubbing salt in the wounds.

06:09.361 --> 06:12.601
And at Christmas
you gave me stock in the company.

06:12.701 --> 06:16.191
- Why are you trying to destroy me?
- Just my natural hostility.

06:16.291 --> 06:20.032
Excuse me.
Benson's attorneys say he still won't sell.

06:20.132 --> 06:23.289
Roger, you researched that company.
What's it worth?

06:23.389 --> 06:25.541
General Electronics? Six million.

06:25.641 --> 06:28.757
Offer six and a quarter,
tell him it's top dollar.

06:28.857 --> 06:30.260
Yes, sir.

06:30.360 --> 06:34.102
Roger, if that deal goes through,
you're in for a bonus.

06:34.202 --> 06:35.397
Bonus?

06:35.951 --> 06:38.736
- Haven't you any conscience?
- What?

06:38.836 --> 06:44.206
Just when I'm reaching a point where I'll
have the courage to go back to Princeton.

06:44.306 --> 06:46.626
- Would it help if I fired you?
- No!

06:46.726 --> 06:50.136
Dr Gruber said this would be
the worst time for that.

06:50.236 --> 06:52.265
- Why?
- I owe him quite a bit of money.

06:52.365 --> 06:54.811
He's brilliant!

06:54.911 --> 06:56.941
Wait a minute. Yes?

06:57.041 --> 07:02.198
- 'Mrs Haskell and Mrs Farnum are here.'
- I'll see them in a moment.

07:02.298 --> 07:04.332
- There she is!
- Who?

07:04.432 --> 07:06.461
- That girl I splashed.
- Where?

07:06.561 --> 07:10.634
Just went into the automat.
Roger, go and apologise for me.

07:10.734 --> 07:14.015
She's a blonde in a raincoat
with a leather collar.

07:14.115 --> 07:16.731
This is in case I damaged her clothes.

07:16.831 --> 07:20.329
I'm a highly paid executive,
not a messenger boy.

07:21.753 --> 07:23.795
OK, I'll go.

07:24.926 --> 07:27.378
You hired me as your financial adviser.

07:27.478 --> 07:31.427
Wouldn't send Bernard Baruch out
to pay off a girl for you.

07:32.650 --> 07:34.312
Oh, yes, you would.

07:47.848 --> 07:49.248
Connie?

07:49.769 --> 07:52.010
Connie! Yoo-hoo!

07:52.110 --> 07:54.980
- Where are you?
- In the cucumbers.

07:57.576 --> 07:58.576
Hi.

07:59.163 --> 08:02.698
That's the first smiling face today.
I only get hungry ones.

08:02.798 --> 08:05.459
What'll it be? Chicken pie or turkey leg?

08:05.559 --> 08:06.963
Chicken.

08:11.605 --> 08:13.641
How'd it go today? Any luck?

08:13.741 --> 08:18.731
All bad. Some idiot splashed me
with his car, practically ruined my dress.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.742
You should see me. He never even stopped.

08:21.842 --> 08:24.870
- Then I had to face Beasley.
- What a parlay!

08:24.970 --> 08:28.585
How is the playboy
of the 8th Avenue unemployment office?

08:28.685 --> 08:32.428
He asked me to his apartment.
I told him what I thought of him.

08:32.528 --> 08:35.099
- Au gratin or baked potato?
- Baked.

08:37.533 --> 08:41.447
He's not worth the trouble.
Does a snake know he's a snake?

08:41.547 --> 08:44.372
He crawls on his stomach
and thinks he's a king.

08:44.472 --> 08:47.961
Right. You know, you're a philosopher.

08:48.061 --> 08:52.552
When a girl of my age still isn't married,
you either philosophise or get arrested.

08:52.652 --> 08:54.477
- Carrots or peas?
- Carrots.

08:57.491 --> 09:01.949
Cathy, your problem is how to keep
your honour AND your job.

09:02.049 --> 09:05.661
Men see you and suddenly their wives
just don't understand them.

09:05.761 --> 09:08.332
I've never done anything to encourage them.

09:08.432 --> 09:11.049
You don't have to, nature did it for you.

09:11.149 --> 09:13.551
- Jell-o?
- Yeah.

09:13.651 --> 09:19.024
Now, there are just so many jobs for girls
who can operate computing machines.

09:19.124 --> 09:22.282
The next job you get, you'll listen to me.

09:22.382 --> 09:24.411
You don't comb your hair, no make-up,

09:24.511 --> 09:28.206
wear military heels,
you remind them of their wives.

09:28.306 --> 09:32.134
They figure this they can get at home
so they leave you alone.

09:32.234 --> 09:36.642
Have some cake, it might make your
skin break out. See you later, honey.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.607
OK. Hey, I have an interview after lunch

09:39.707 --> 09:42.449
- so I'll call you when it's over.
- Good.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.252
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

09:46.425 --> 09:48.425
Mr Miller.

09:48.679 --> 09:50.715
Miss Emerson.

09:50.815 --> 09:54.555
Are you familiar with company policy
on giving away free food?

09:54.655 --> 09:57.519
No, sir. Are we for it or against it?

09:57.619 --> 10:00.900
That will cost you
one dollar and twelve cents.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.698
However, I might be willing
to overlook the incident

10:04.798 --> 10:07.542
if you, uh, introduce me to your friend.

10:07.642 --> 10:11.254
- How is Mrs Miller?
- She doesn't understand me.

10:11.354 --> 10:13.809
I could've made book on that answer.

10:23.125 --> 10:26.494
Excuse me,
were you struck by a car this morning?

10:26.594 --> 10:29.421
- What?
- Splattered by a limousine?

10:29.521 --> 10:31.588
Oh. Yes, I certainly was.

10:31.688 --> 10:35.809
The gentleman who owns the car
has offices across the street.

10:35.909 --> 10:40.442
He saw you from his window
and sent me to convey his regrets.

10:40.542 --> 10:44.116
I should think a gentleman
would apologise himself.

10:44.216 --> 10:47.912
- Well, Mr Shayne's a very busy man.
- Oh, really?

10:48.012 --> 10:52.550
Is that why he didn't stop?
That's leaving the scene of an accident.

10:52.650 --> 10:54.763
If there was any damage done...

10:54.863 --> 10:58.981
My raincoat was practically ruined.
And look at this dress.

10:59.081 --> 11:02.987
I've been authorised to compensate you
for any damage done.

11:03.087 --> 11:05.701
- Well, you just tell Mr...
- Shayne.

11:05.801 --> 11:08.915
...Shayne, that money
does not buy good manners.

11:09.015 --> 11:11.046
I wish I could tell him that myself.

11:11.146 --> 11:13.926
- Do you? Really?
- I certainly do.

11:14.026 --> 11:15.846
You're right!

11:15.946 --> 11:19.688
How would you feel?
Here I am, he practically runs me down

11:19.788 --> 11:21.819
and then drives right away!

11:21.919 --> 11:25.159
And doesn't have the decency
to apologise himself.

11:25.259 --> 11:28.749
Furthermore I have a job interview
and have to go like this.

11:28.849 --> 11:31.337
- He doesn't care.
- Ohhh.

11:33.019 --> 11:36.265
- You know what I'd like to do?
- Throw the money in his face?

11:36.365 --> 11:37.959
Exactly!

11:38.279 --> 11:41.276
I'd like to throw that money right in his face.

11:41.376 --> 11:43.404
- Would you?
- Yes, I would.

11:43.504 --> 11:46.284
I've waited seven years for this moment.

11:46.384 --> 11:48.421
You come with me.

11:52.559 --> 11:55.844
Say, Connie,
there's a man dragging Cathy out.

11:55.944 --> 11:59.563
Gee. They don't even
give her a chance to eat.

12:05.251 --> 12:09.998
She's gonna spend the rest of her life
saying, "I'm not that kind of a girl."

12:10.098 --> 12:14.560
I'm only afraid that some day,
before she can finish saying it, she will be.

12:17.735 --> 12:19.560
There you are.

12:19.660 --> 12:24.697
The Manhattan Home for Young Women
thanks you for your generous donation

12:24.797 --> 12:26.949
and for permitting us to use your name

12:27.049 --> 12:30.415
- in our fundraising drive.
- Well, it's a worthy cause.

12:30.515 --> 12:35.636
There's a great need to provide
an atmosphere of care and understanding

12:35.736 --> 12:37.766
during this critical period.

12:37.866 --> 12:40.979
You'd be shocked
that the rate of unwed mothers...

12:41.079 --> 12:44.155
Charlotte, we don't
call them unwed mothers.

12:44.255 --> 12:48.456
...that the rate of unfortunate girls
has tripled in five years.

12:48.556 --> 12:51.295
- It's a deplorable situation.
- Yes, yes.

12:51.395 --> 12:54.007
There's one consolation, Mrs Farnum -

12:54.107 --> 12:57.355
for every unwed mother,
there's an unwed father.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.521
I never thought of it that way.

13:00.621 --> 13:03.279
Well, thank you again, Mr Shayne.

13:03.379 --> 13:05.615
- Goodbye, Mr Shayne.
- Goodbye.

13:07.922 --> 13:12.130
Wasn't it sweet of him
to contribute so generously?

13:12.230 --> 13:16.385
Mr Shayne doesn't deny he's responsible
for what happened to me?

13:16.485 --> 13:18.516
- No.
- The least he could've done

13:18.616 --> 13:23.107
was come to see me himself instead
of sending someone over with money.

13:23.207 --> 13:25.906
Some men have no sense
of moral obligation.

13:26.006 --> 13:30.497
Same thing happened to my friend Connie.
He never even told her his name.

13:30.597 --> 13:32.629
No. Have a seat.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.764
I'll tell him you're here.

13:36.731 --> 13:40.234
My dear, when the time comes,
call this number.

13:41.407 --> 13:43.449
Psst! Miss Timberlake.

13:48.797 --> 13:53.588
No wonder he donated so generously.
Guilt feelings.

13:53.688 --> 13:56.051
Now, Evelyn, we must be realistic.

13:56.151 --> 14:01.146
When a man donates $200,000,
he's entitled to use the facilities.

14:02.492 --> 14:06.739
He's in there, he'll be right out.
Don't forget what you're gonna say -

14:06.839 --> 14:10.037
reckless driving,
leaving the scene of an accident,

14:10.137 --> 14:12.540
bad manners, then the money in the face!

14:12.640 --> 14:16.257
There are few other things I'd do
if I weren't a lady.

14:16.357 --> 14:19.806
This is no time to think of sex. Now, go!

14:19.906 --> 14:22.361
Mr Shayne, Miss Timberlake.

14:26.082 --> 14:27.701
Miss Timberlake?

14:27.801 --> 14:31.001
Go get him.
Miss Timberlake has something to say.

14:34.015 --> 14:35.015
Yes?

14:35.644 --> 14:38.179
I- I'd like to apologise

14:38.279 --> 14:41.520
uh, for getting in your way this morning.

14:41.620 --> 14:44.899
- It was entirely my fault.
- I was practically jaywalking.

14:44.999 --> 14:48.826
- You had a perfect right to be on the kerb.
- I was leaning over.

14:48.926 --> 14:54.795
I'm sorry I couldn't stop. My driver circled
the block but when we got back you'd gone.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.676
- Leaving the scene of an accident.
- Oh.

14:57.776 --> 15:01.308
I don't know why I left.
I must have gotten panicky.

15:01.408 --> 15:02.979
Him, not you!

15:03.079 --> 15:06.328
Roger, don't you have a letter
to get off to Princeton?

15:08.795 --> 15:13.958
I should've come down to the restaurant
to apologise but I had some people here.

15:14.058 --> 15:18.430
Knowing how busy you are, I'm surprised
you found time to send anyone.

15:18.530 --> 15:21.892
If I've damaged anything in any way...

15:21.992 --> 15:24.024
Oh, not really.

15:24.124 --> 15:29.197
Water's good for raincoats,
and there's just a few spots on my dress.

15:29.297 --> 15:32.331
- I'll be glad to pay for a new dress.
- No, thank you.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.423
I was going on an interview,
it wasn't important.

15:35.523 --> 15:39.138
You can't go on an interview like that.
Come with me.

15:40.777 --> 15:43.857
- 'Yes, Mr Shayne?'
- Send up the valet.

15:43.957 --> 15:48.491
You can have your things back
in 20 minutes. You can change in there.

15:48.591 --> 15:53.299
There's a bathroom on your right and in that
closet there's a topcoat you can wear.

15:55.057 --> 15:57.092
Well, go on, do as I tell you.

15:57.192 --> 15:59.181
That's right.

16:00.234 --> 16:03.107
- Connie, it's for you.
- Oh. Thanks.

16:04.242 --> 16:06.444
Hello? Cathy?

16:06.544 --> 16:09.701
- Where'd you go?
- Across the street in Mr Shayne's office.

16:09.801 --> 16:12.580
- What about your lunch?
- Once I get my dress back.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.340
What floor are you on?
Millie, get the cleaver!

16:15.440 --> 16:17.300
Honey, we'll be right over.

16:17.400 --> 16:22.769
Connie, I'm all right. He sent my dress out
to have it cleaned.

16:22.869 --> 16:24.775
See you later.

16:26.747 --> 16:28.788
Sent it out to have it cleaned?

16:30.129 --> 16:33.667
I have heard of sneaky ways
to undress a girl but...

16:37.727 --> 16:40.763
Isn't that the man
who took Cathy out of here?

16:40.863 --> 16:42.521
Let me see.

16:43.573 --> 16:45.568
That's the one.

16:59.313 --> 17:02.432
The tractor division should show
an increase in earnings.

17:02.532 --> 17:06.067
Fine. Now we're back
to General Electronics.

17:07.454 --> 17:09.906
Still no breakthrough.

17:10.007 --> 17:11.602
Come in.

17:12.131 --> 17:15.420
- Ooh, I'm sorry.
- Wait a minute, whoa.

17:16.557 --> 17:20.012
- Come on in.
- Mr Shayne, I thought you were alone.

17:21.275 --> 17:24.977
Um, it didn't come back yet
and I have an appointment.

17:25.077 --> 17:27.109
All right, I'll check on it.

17:27.210 --> 17:30.534
Wait a minute.
Gentlemen, this is Miss Timberlake.

17:30.634 --> 17:32.952
- How do you do?
- Come on in.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.837
- Oh, I didn't want to interrupt.
- You're not interrupting.

17:39.229 --> 17:42.809
Miss Timberlake, we need to know
why a man won't sell a company

17:42.909 --> 17:46.358
when we've offered him
more than it's worth. Go ahead.

17:47.496 --> 17:50.115
Well, we've tried everyone.

17:50.215 --> 17:54.834
We talked to Benson's lawyers,
his directors and his executive assistant.

17:54.934 --> 17:58.341
Now, who else is there to talk to?

17:58.441 --> 18:00.476
There, you see.

18:02.610 --> 18:06.523
- Have you talked to Mr Benson?
- Have you talked to Mr Benson?

18:06.623 --> 18:08.018
Well...

18:08.748 --> 18:09.748
no.

18:10.501 --> 18:13.291
No, they haven't talked to Mr Benson.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.795
Well, the same thing happened
to my Aunt Rachel.

18:17.895 --> 18:23.477
Um, this man she knows in the next town
kept sending her letters proposing to her,

18:23.577 --> 18:26.022
and she just kept turning him down.

18:26.122 --> 18:32.078
Now, she wanted to get married but
she felt that he should've asked in person.

18:33.757 --> 18:35.793
There, you see, gentlemen.

18:35.893 --> 18:40.800
Perhaps Mr Benson is eager to become
a bride but has never been asked.

18:40.900 --> 18:44.144
How would your Aunt Rachel have felt
about a phone call?

18:44.244 --> 18:47.856
Oh, no. She wouldn't say yes
till he came to the house.

18:47.956 --> 18:49.988
They have eight children now.

18:50.088 --> 18:53.368
Well, that couldn't have happened
over the phone.

18:53.468 --> 18:56.083
Miss Timberlake,

18:56.183 --> 18:59.592
how would you like to go for a ride with me?
Come on.

18:59.692 --> 19:02.054
What are you doing in Baltimore?

19:02.154 --> 19:05.062
I'm here with Mr Shayne. We...

19:05.162 --> 19:07.607
Well, of course I've got my clothes on.

19:07.707 --> 19:10.654
Connie, we flew here in his private plane.

19:10.754 --> 19:15.163
Gosh, you should see it,
it's completely furnished. Even has a bar.

19:15.263 --> 19:18.922
Honey, this time
you've run into a shrewd one.

19:19.022 --> 19:21.930
Once he gets you up there, you can't argue.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.058
It's hit the silk or else.

19:24.158 --> 19:29.532
Connie, he's here to buy a company and
he brought me along as a good luck charm.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.292
I'll call you back. Bye.

19:34.465 --> 19:37.795
- What happened?
- Well, Aunt Rachel said yes.

19:37.895 --> 19:40.886
- Good.
- And I owe it all to you.

19:40.986 --> 19:44.475
Miss Timberlake,
I'm glad I almost ran you down today.

19:44.575 --> 19:46.369
I am too.

19:46.699 --> 19:50.234
Let's go and toast that puddle
that brought us together.

19:50.334 --> 19:53.450
- Do you care for Italian food?
- Oh, I love it.

19:53.550 --> 19:57.082
Good, I know a little place,
if you like fettucine?

19:57.182 --> 20:00.266
- Er, yes.
- This is the only place to have it.

20:10.122 --> 20:11.741
- Hello?
- 'Hi.'

20:11.841 --> 20:13.824
Cathy? Where are you?

20:13.924 --> 20:17.124
- In Philadelphia.
- 'What are you doing there?'

20:17.224 --> 20:19.710
It's the only place to have fettucine.

20:19.810 --> 20:25.183
I should've thought of that. I thought he took
you there to buy you the Liberty Bell.

20:25.283 --> 20:30.108
Get off that merry-go-round. He's just
another Beasley with a flying bedroom.

20:30.208 --> 20:34.996
Oh, Connie, he's not like anyone.
You've never met a man like this.

20:35.096 --> 20:37.125
That's the problem, neither have you.

20:37.225 --> 20:40.799
- I have so much to tell you when I get back.
- 'If you get back.'

20:40.899 --> 20:43.850
We're leaving, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

20:45.236 --> 20:50.571
- Well, did you get your roommate?
- Yes. She said to be sure and say hello.

20:50.671 --> 20:55.621
You'll have to pay the piper for dinner by
sitting through a report I'm due to deliver.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.373
I don't mind.

20:57.473 --> 21:03.015
How do you feel about untapped natural
resources of underdeveloped countries?

21:04.191 --> 21:06.598
I think they ought to be tapped.

21:06.698 --> 21:10.995
Hmm. You've condensed
a 40-minute speech into one sentence.

21:14.587 --> 21:18.417
The wealth of a nation
is in the wellbeing of its people,

21:18.517 --> 21:21.509
both spiritually and materialistically.

21:21.609 --> 21:24.721
It's not a question of lowering our standards

21:24.821 --> 21:27.647
but of helping others to raise theirs.

21:27.747 --> 21:30.608
If all people everywhere could be content

21:30.708 --> 21:34.912
and their living standards even
and compatible with ours,

21:35.012 --> 21:37.040
there would be no envy in the world

21:37.140 --> 21:40.471
and, therefore, less provocation of war.

21:41.643 --> 21:45.973
When you encourage and help people
to develop their own natural resources,

21:46.073 --> 21:48.476
you do more than put bread in their mouths,

21:48.576 --> 21:50.616
you put dignity in their hearts.

21:56.423 --> 21:58.668
Even the Russians are applauding.

22:03.312 --> 22:05.771
- Isn't he magnificent?
- Yeah.

22:06.527 --> 22:09.608
- His car nearly ran me down this morning.
- Ooh!

22:09.708 --> 22:12.159
- Yeah.
- What a delightful way to go.

22:14.586 --> 22:18.038
Now we've discussed
the world's natural resources,

22:18.138 --> 22:20.170
let's explore some of our own.

22:20.270 --> 22:24.927
Miss Timberlake, New York's a wonderful
city, what would you like to do with it?

22:25.027 --> 22:28.725
I don't know.
I've never been offered a city before.

22:28.825 --> 22:32.070
That doesn't speak well
for the boys back home.

22:32.170 --> 22:37.499
It's really not their fault. "Miss Timberlake,
I offer you Upper Sandusky."

22:37.599 --> 22:41.293
- You see?
- It doesn't have the same ring.

22:41.393 --> 22:44.929
What is a pretty girl offered
in Upper Sandusky?

22:46.276 --> 22:47.766
Baseball.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.936
I went to a lot of baseball games.

22:50.036 --> 22:53.280
A friend of mine has a box
behind the third base dugout.

22:53.380 --> 22:56.909
- Oh, that's nice.
- Cougars won the pennant in '58.

22:57.009 --> 23:00.086
If you like baseball we've got a local team.

23:00.186 --> 23:03.592
Oh, the Yankees. Oh.

23:03.692 --> 23:06.560
The Cougars they are not but they try hard.

23:15.377 --> 23:16.777
Strike!

23:17.715 --> 23:23.468
Strike? Hey, ump! Shake your head,
your eyeballs are stuck!

23:23.568 --> 23:26.565
It was a ball! It was that far from the plate.

23:28.529 --> 23:33.526
Little lady, will you let me umpire this game?
You've been on my back all night.

23:33.626 --> 23:37.242
- Mickey, you saw that pitch. It was a ball.
- It looked like it.

23:37.342 --> 23:39.291
You're out of the game, Mantle.

23:39.391 --> 23:41.709
What? Roger, how'd that pitch look?

23:41.809 --> 23:44.727
- It could've missed the corner.
- You're out, Maris.

23:46.691 --> 23:50.605
- Yogi.
- It's a perfect strike, the ump was right.

23:50.705 --> 23:54.280
I don't like sarcasm, Berra.
You're out of the game too!

23:54.380 --> 23:56.409
You can't do that!

23:56.509 --> 23:57.903
Lady...

23:58.633 --> 24:02.001
- Where's the manager?
- I think he's hiding.

24:02.101 --> 24:04.098
Oh! Ooh...

24:05.104 --> 24:08.184
I didn't mean to get
all those men thrown out.

24:08.284 --> 24:11.062
It proved they could win
without their starting line-up.

24:11.162 --> 24:14.610
I always get that way at ball games.
I lose control.

24:14.710 --> 24:16.743
Well, it's over now, we won.

24:16.843 --> 24:20.122
I know just the place
where you could calm down.

24:20.222 --> 24:22.510
- Where?
- My apartment.

24:40.928 --> 24:44.424
It's not ready for a housewarming
but how do you like it?

24:44.524 --> 24:48.932
- It's beautiful up here.
- I might put in some walls over there.

24:49.032 --> 24:53.735
And perhaps a ceiling,
just to give it that traditional touch.

24:53.835 --> 24:55.871
That would be nice.

24:57.963 --> 25:01.126
The, er, the living room will be there,

25:01.226 --> 25:03.255
and the bedroom there.

25:03.355 --> 25:05.717
I think the bedroom should be there.

25:05.817 --> 25:07.847
Wherever you say.

25:07.947 --> 25:09.977
And I love fireplaces.

25:10.077 --> 25:14.401
There'll be one in every room.
And bookcases, I like books everywhere.

25:14.501 --> 25:17.532
- And good reading lamps.
- That's the idea.

25:17.632 --> 25:20.747
- Plenty of paintings.
- Mmm. And a built-in oven.

25:20.847 --> 25:24.711
- And a sunken bathtub.
- Oh, I love taking sunken baths.

25:24.811 --> 25:26.851
You'd always find me in it.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.273
I didn't mean it that way, I...

25:32.373 --> 25:35.822
I know you didn't.
But let's not abandon the idea.

25:37.001 --> 25:38.601
Cathy...

25:38.755 --> 25:41.374
I've got to go to Bermuda for a few days.

25:41.474 --> 25:43.837
How would you like to join me there?

25:43.937 --> 25:45.967
Then we could go on to Paris.

25:46.067 --> 25:49.391
- Have you ever been to Paris?
- No.

25:49.491 --> 25:52.854
That's the best way to see it,
for the first time.

25:52.954 --> 25:58.658
I know a restaurant in Paris where you can
get some marvellous French food.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.789
Then we'll go to Monte Carlo,

26:00.889 --> 26:05.341
where I can get a friend to take us
for a cruise around the Greek islands.

26:05.441 --> 26:08.848
That's the only way to see them -
slowly, by boat.

26:08.948 --> 26:12.643
They're like fine paintings -
you mustn't rush up to them.

26:12.743 --> 26:17.616
We'll continue around the world, get back,
and this building will be finished.

26:17.716 --> 26:22.751
If you don't like this apartment
you can have one of the others.

26:22.851 --> 26:25.297
- May I ask one question?
- Go on.

26:25.397 --> 26:27.717
Did you just ask me to marry you?

26:27.817 --> 26:28.817
No.

26:33.325 --> 26:36.238
- Oh.
- I didn't mean to mislead you.

26:36.338 --> 26:38.373
Oh, you didn't.

26:39.713 --> 26:42.793
You're very honest and I admire you for that.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.843
- Then you're not offended.
- No.

26:46.978 --> 26:49.020
Well, then what is it?

26:50.527 --> 26:52.652
I'm a little frightened of you.

26:53.909 --> 26:56.778
Oh, I know many people
who can't stand me.

26:56.878 --> 26:58.909
I can stand you all right.

26:59.009 --> 27:01.841
Now, Cathy, if this presents a problem...

27:04.180 --> 27:07.093
You know, Mr Shayne, I feel I can trust you.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.222
What would you advise me to do?

27:09.322 --> 27:12.851
Oh, please, I'm hardly in a position
to give advice.

27:12.951 --> 27:14.650
But I respect your opinion.

27:14.750 --> 27:18.823
That's like asking a man
to testify against himself.

27:18.923 --> 27:23.832
Cathy, you have rare qualities.
You're direct, sincere, uncomplicated,

27:23.932 --> 27:27.881
the type of woman who brings out
the worst in a man - his conscience.

27:27.981 --> 27:31.014
Oh, I didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

27:31.114 --> 27:33.146
It's rather disturbing.

27:33.246 --> 27:38.447
See, a man's conscience is generally
in direct opposition to his best interests.

27:38.547 --> 27:42.456
And, in your best interests,
I'd better disqualify myself.

27:42.556 --> 27:44.759
So this has to be your decision.

27:48.229 --> 27:49.511
There's only one decision.

27:50.483 --> 27:55.146
Get a lawyer, blackmail him, get a potful of
money and go to Bermuda without him.

27:55.246 --> 27:59.406
You're condemning him
without even knowing him. You really are.

27:59.506 --> 28:03.165
You should've heard
him speak to the United Nations.

28:03.265 --> 28:07.212
Khrushchev spoke there too!
Would I let you go to Bermuda with him?

28:07.312 --> 28:09.678
Connie, how can you compare them?

28:09.778 --> 28:14.352
All I know is this, he did not try to lure me
to Bermuda or anywhere else.

28:14.452 --> 28:17.946
He was completely honest,
a perfect gentleman.

28:18.046 --> 28:22.370
A man meets you and in the same day
asks you to live with him?

28:22.470 --> 28:26.167
I met a guy with a diamond stick pin
and a waxed moustache

28:26.267 --> 28:28.717
and even he waited until the second date.

28:28.817 --> 28:32.059
If he's a perfect gentleman,
waxed moustache is Albert Schweitzer.

28:32.159 --> 28:37.399
OK, answer me this - why didn't he try to
influence me when I asked for his advice?

28:37.499 --> 28:39.821
Because that's the way he operates.

28:39.921 --> 28:44.043
Some guys ride the subways pinching girls,
he works out of a limousine.

28:44.143 --> 28:45.543
But a pincher is a pincher.

28:45.643 --> 28:49.385
Connie, I don't wanna hear
another word against him.

28:49.485 --> 28:52.437
OK, if that's the way you feel about it.

28:53.989 --> 28:55.589
I tried.

28:57.955 --> 28:59.997
What's this?

29:02.005 --> 29:05.252
Some woman
in Mr Shayne's office gave it to me.

29:05.352 --> 29:07.964
Boy, has this guy got an organisation.

29:08.064 --> 29:10.933
He even has a medical plan for his victims!

29:14.740 --> 29:16.781
Not another word.

29:44.551 --> 29:45.951
Connie.

29:48.851 --> 29:51.096
- Connie.
- Hmm? Huh?

29:52.776 --> 29:53.776
What?

29:54.488 --> 29:56.530
I think I'm in love.

29:57.244 --> 30:01.709
Try to get some sleep, honey,
you'll feel better in the morning.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.476
Connie?

30:19.665 --> 30:22.123
- Mmm?
- You sleeping?

30:28.433 --> 30:30.468
It's four o'clock.

30:30.568 --> 30:32.890
Why would I be sleeping?

30:34.779 --> 30:37.526
I've made a decision.

30:37.626 --> 30:39.654
I'm not gonna go with him.

30:39.754 --> 30:41.789
It's for the best.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.926
- Connie?
- Mmm?

30:50.060 --> 30:54.561
When he calls, how do I tell him no
without hurting his feelings?

30:59.204 --> 31:02.909
Call this number,
you'll get some good suggestions.

31:11.897 --> 31:15.182
I wonder what shade of hair
I ought to wear this week.

31:15.282 --> 31:18.276
I didn't do too well as a blonde.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.943
Raven. That wasn't bad.

31:21.043 --> 31:23.082
I got whistled at by a bird.

31:24.423 --> 31:27.510
Grey. Maybe they'll feel sorry for me.

31:37.783 --> 31:41.908
Look, if you don't know how to tell him,
when he calls I'll talk to him.

31:42.008 --> 31:44.036
I'll talk to him.

31:44.136 --> 31:50.170
But I just want to say it in a way that he won't
think it any personal reflection on him.

31:50.270 --> 31:52.303
You're worried about him?

31:52.403 --> 31:55.104
Oh, boy, men really have this game beat.

31:56.113 --> 31:58.981
For 2,000 years we have had their children,

31:59.081 --> 32:03.202
washed their clothes, cooked their meals
and cleaned their houses.

32:03.302 --> 32:07.207
What do they give us in return?
The right to smoke in public.

32:07.307 --> 32:09.338
We sold out for a cigarette.

32:09.438 --> 32:11.473
And you don't even smoke.

32:12.855 --> 32:15.769
Good morning, good morning!

32:15.869 --> 32:18.942
- It's a great day out.
- You're very happy, Roger.

32:19.042 --> 32:21.525
Check that with Dr Gruber,
it might be serious.

32:21.625 --> 32:25.786
I had a wonderful night's rest.
I've solved the trouble I have sleeping.

32:25.886 --> 32:30.379
Just before you go to bed, put three
tranquillisers in a jigger of brandy.

32:30.479 --> 32:33.972
You still can't sleep
but you're so relaxed you don't care.

32:34.072 --> 32:38.107
Fancy that. People who sleep
don't know what they're missing.

32:38.207 --> 32:41.987
Here's your chance to analyse
the Harrington report.

32:42.875 --> 32:46.078
- 'Yes, Mr Shayne?'
- Did you call Miss Timberlake yet?

32:46.178 --> 32:48.209
- 'No, sir.'
- Cancel it.

32:48.309 --> 32:52.133
- Miss Timberlake?
- Yeah, the young lady from the automat.

32:52.233 --> 32:54.469
- What happened with her?
- Nothing.

32:54.569 --> 32:57.851
I've been wrestling
with my conscience all morning.

32:57.951 --> 32:59.983
- And I lost.
- That's an upset.

33:00.083 --> 33:02.613
Her mother's a teacher,
father's a druggist,

33:02.713 --> 33:05.576
brother's an eagle scout
and she sang in the church choir.

33:05.676 --> 33:10.380
To take her to Bermuda is a desecration
of everything the Minutemen fought for.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.676
- You asked her to go away with you?
- Yes.

33:12.776 --> 33:14.895
- But you're not gonna take her.
- No.

33:16.319 --> 33:18.560
What a terrible thing to do to me.

33:18.660 --> 33:21.231
- To you?
- I've built this image of a man,

33:21.331 --> 33:24.032
cold, ruthless, predatory,

33:24.132 --> 33:28.623
now you go do a decent thing like this
to destroy that image.

33:28.723 --> 33:31.422
You've set me back years in my analysis.

33:31.522 --> 33:33.346
Oh, I'm ashamed of myself.

33:34.440 --> 33:38.905
Well, Roger, if I've done anything human,
I'll make it up to you.

33:40.118 --> 33:43.403
Would it help if I fired
every employee over 60?

33:43.503 --> 33:44.503
No.

33:45.629 --> 33:50.011
Hey, wait a minute, take the wrapper off.
It's better that way.

33:51.683 --> 33:54.930
11:30. He said he'd call
first thing in the morning.

33:55.030 --> 33:59.020
Well, now you don't have to worry
about not hurting his feelings.

33:59.120 --> 34:03.445
At least he should give me the courtesy
of hurting his feelings.

34:03.545 --> 34:07.038
A man picks you up off the street,
takes you to his office,

34:07.138 --> 34:10.795
makes you take your clothes off
and propositions you.

34:10.895 --> 34:14.469
- What can you expect from a man like that?
- Respect.

34:14.570 --> 34:18.349
Respect.
On that note of logic, I'll go to work.

34:18.449 --> 34:22.234
He should've had the decency to call
and get my answer.

34:38.195 --> 34:42.743
Well, I'm not paying for you just to sit there.
Do something! Ring!

34:48.884 --> 34:50.083
Hello?

34:50.804 --> 34:54.051
Yes, I'll talk to her. Hello, Cathy.

34:54.150 --> 34:56.635
Weren't you supposed to call this morning?

34:56.735 --> 35:00.647
I'm sorry, I didn't think I should
under the circumstances.

35:00.747 --> 35:03.066
What circumstances?

35:03.166 --> 35:05.199
Cathy, I came to a decision.

35:05.299 --> 35:08.578
I thought I was supposed
to make this decision.

35:08.678 --> 35:11.210
Yes, but considering the situation.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.340
What situation?

35:13.440 --> 35:16.931
Well, I'm sure Upper Sandusky
is a delightful town

35:17.031 --> 35:20.894
but it hardly prepares a girl
for this kind of situation.

35:20.994 --> 35:24.572
I can see you don't know the girls
in Upper Sandusky.

35:24.672 --> 35:27.951
- They're always prepared.
- I'm sure they are.

35:28.051 --> 35:30.583
We're not unsophisticated rustics.

35:30.683 --> 35:35.091
I'm not attacking you culturally. I'm sure
you have fine libraries and museums.

35:35.191 --> 35:37.223
We also have a home for girls.

35:37.323 --> 35:41.896
We may not be as large as New York
but we're just as progressive.

35:41.996 --> 35:44.400
Last year we had a scandal
at the country club...

35:44.500 --> 35:48.789
- I'm sure it's a zippy little community.
- Things are hoppin' up there!

35:48.889 --> 35:53.712
I apologise. I should have called you
and given you the opportunity of saying no.

35:53.812 --> 35:58.017
- You certainly should have.
- And I respect that decision.

35:58.117 --> 36:00.520
- What decision?
- Not to go.

36:02.034 --> 36:06.075
I hate to disappoint you, Mr Shayne,
but the answer is yes!

36:06.175 --> 36:09.248
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure!

36:09.348 --> 36:12.043
- Unless you're thinking of backing...
- No.

36:12.143 --> 36:15.635
I just suddenly see Upper Sandusky
in a new light.

36:15.735 --> 36:19.226
- Will I be hearing from you?
- As soon as I make the arrangements.

36:19.326 --> 36:21.564
- Thank you.
- Thank you for calling.

36:22.702 --> 36:25.365
Well, you heard. I tried to talk her out of it.

36:25.465 --> 36:31.210
No, I brought her to throw money in your
face. I delivered the sparrow to the hawk.

36:31.310 --> 36:35.427
The sparrow's flying south. She'll need
clothes so make the arrangements.

36:35.527 --> 36:38.805
No. I will not dress the victim for sacrifice.

36:38.905 --> 36:43.026
Bergdorf Goodman have a new line
of sacrificial evening gowns.

36:43.126 --> 36:46.987
I have waited years to tell you
what you can do with your job,

36:47.087 --> 36:49.832
your salary, bonuses and fringe benefits.

36:49.932 --> 36:52.376
- Yes, Roger?
- I've waited this long.

36:52.476 --> 36:57.268
- And I can wait a little longer.
- Good. Wait over there, do it quietly.

36:58.233 --> 37:01.985
So he insulted Upper Sandusky,
this is no way to get even.

37:03.118 --> 37:05.659
You're carrying civic pride too far.

37:07.418 --> 37:10.454
OK, if your mind's made up, fine.

37:10.554 --> 37:12.591
Send postcards.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.301
Well, he did it.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.437
Rasputin talked her into it.

37:22.491 --> 37:24.533
Connie, look.

37:47.542 --> 37:49.367
- Miss Timberlake?
- Yes.

37:49.467 --> 37:52.665
They're waiting for you
at Bergdorf Goodman.

37:52.765 --> 37:56.181
- Who are you?
- Leonard. I'm assigned as coordinator.

37:57.646 --> 38:00.310
Oh? What do you coordinate?

38:00.410 --> 38:01.410
You.

40:03.739 --> 40:05.780
Thank you very much.

40:07.747 --> 40:11.077
Oh, Connie, please stop crying.

40:11.177 --> 40:13.379
I'm only going around the world.

40:14.177 --> 40:15.577
I know.

40:17.225 --> 40:21.061
Oh, Cathy, you look so beautiful.

40:22.402 --> 40:24.437
Just like a bride.

40:24.537 --> 40:26.567
Oh, I'm sorry!

40:26.667 --> 40:29.534
Oh, Connie, I'm all right, really I am.

40:30.711 --> 40:33.964
What can happen to me?

40:35.345 --> 40:37.387
Oh, Connie, please, stop.

40:38.143 --> 40:39.543
Connie.

40:40.272 --> 40:41.672
Please?

40:44.865 --> 40:47.272
I'm all right now.

40:47.372 --> 40:50.572
Oh, Cathy, have a good trip.

40:50.672 --> 40:54.456
Oh, I will. I'll write to you
as soon as I get to Bermuda.

40:56.013 --> 40:58.851
Oh, Cathy, you look lovely in that coat.

40:59.729 --> 41:02.264
You mother would be so proud of you...

41:02.364 --> 41:04.603
Oh, I'm so sorry!

41:08.204 --> 41:10.804
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:13.590 --> 41:15.632
Enjoy yourself.

41:16.889 --> 41:18.489
I think.

41:31.544 --> 41:36.168
When she said she'd throw that money
in his face she became a symbol of hope.

41:36.268 --> 41:38.297
Look at her.

41:38.397 --> 41:42.144
It's like watching Joan of Arc
on her way to the fire.

41:46.909 --> 41:50.028
'Good morning, welcome aboard flight 603.

41:50.128 --> 41:55.542
'This is your pilot, Captain Miller.
Your copilot is Captain Saunders.

41:55.642 --> 42:00.298
'We will be cruising at 31,000 feet
at an average speed of 500 miles an hour.

42:00.398 --> 42:02.935
'We hope you will have a pleasant trip.'

42:06.908 --> 42:09.777
- Are you comfortable, Miss Timberlake?
- Yes, thank you.

42:09.877 --> 42:13.997
Is this the off season for Bermuda.
No, we're booked solid.

42:14.097 --> 42:16.131
Mr Shayne bought every seat.

42:19.517 --> 42:21.559
Oh! It's all right.

42:59.057 --> 43:02.342
Cathy, you're too much.
Here, let me take this.

43:02.442 --> 43:05.013
Mr Shayne, everything was so expensive.

43:05.113 --> 43:08.313
I told Leonard not to spend so much
but he insisted.

43:08.413 --> 43:11.156
- Who's Leonard?
- He works for you.

43:11.256 --> 43:13.573
- Oh, he does?
- He coordinated me.

43:13.673 --> 43:16.122
You know, he sort of put me together.

43:16.222 --> 43:20.931
Well, no reflection on Leonard
but he merely put a frame on a Renoir.

44:57.341 --> 44:59.383
Here's your key, Mr Shayne.

45:00.890 --> 45:03.134
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

45:04.815 --> 45:06.857
Come along.

45:18.969 --> 45:21.004
Stand there.

45:21.104 --> 45:23.140
Don't move, don't go away.

45:28.823 --> 45:32.947
Nowhere else in the world can you see
beaches with pink sand.

45:33.047 --> 45:35.825
Pirate ships used to anchor in that cove.

45:35.925 --> 45:41.217
Only pirates from the best families,
naturally. The others couldn't afford it.

45:51.536 --> 45:55.071
There's the kitchen
in case you get hungry in the night.

45:55.171 --> 45:58.082
Oh, no. Once I get in bed I'm through.

45:58.182 --> 46:00.210
I sleep like a rock.

46:00.310 --> 46:04.005
I wish I had that faculty.
Takes me hours to get to sleep.

46:04.105 --> 46:06.472
Have you tried hot milk and butter?

46:06.572 --> 46:08.858
No, I'm not that anxious to sleep.

46:17.464 --> 46:20.461
I want you to look at something.

46:20.561 --> 46:23.308
Have you ever seen anything like that?

46:24.562 --> 46:25.562
No.

46:26.065 --> 46:29.937
It means so much more
when you can share it with someone.

46:30.741 --> 46:34.193
How long will it take you to get ready?

46:34.293 --> 46:36.326
- For what?
- A swim.

46:36.426 --> 46:38.872
Shall we go to the pool? Can you swim?

46:38.972 --> 46:41.630
Oh, swim! That I can do.

46:41.730 --> 46:44.674
If you'd like to change,
I'll wait on the balcony.

46:44.774 --> 46:49.271
No. A gentleman always allows
the lady to undress first.

47:12.076 --> 47:14.118
'She knows.'

47:37.796 --> 47:39.837
'They know.'

48:00.467 --> 48:02.509
'Everybody knows!'

48:21.009 --> 48:23.756
I want to thank you for a wonderful day.

48:23.856 --> 48:27.012
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- Will I see you tomorrow?

48:27.112 --> 48:28.930
I imagine so.

48:29.030 --> 48:31.068
Good. Good night.

48:38.629 --> 48:40.703
I think I'm registered here.

48:40.803 --> 48:41.803
Oh.

49:04.975 --> 49:07.016
Is there anything you'd like?

49:07.689 --> 49:09.730
How about a late movie?

49:10.528 --> 49:12.986
All the theatres are closed.

49:13.993 --> 49:17.615
- We can watch one on television.
- There is no television.

49:20.590 --> 49:23.428
What do people do here at night?

49:25.433 --> 49:28.640
I mean, um, for entertainment.

49:29.609 --> 49:31.318
I mean, um...

49:32.573 --> 49:35.530
to... pass the time.

49:36.957 --> 49:38.992
They make up games, Cathy.

49:39.092 --> 49:41.414
Simple, fun games.

49:44.848 --> 49:46.890
Come over here.

49:50.192 --> 49:51.992
Sit down.

49:54.368 --> 49:57.153
Cathy, this is a very special place to me.

49:57.253 --> 49:59.868
I've never brought a girl here before.

49:59.968 --> 50:02.337
You're not sorry you came, are you?

50:07.144 --> 50:09.179
What are you doing?

50:09.279 --> 50:11.315
I'm kissing you. Do you mind?

50:12.029 --> 50:14.071
Not if you don't.

50:14.910 --> 50:18.614
Well, relax. I'll keep you informed
of my every move.

50:21.006 --> 50:23.041
You have a beautiful back.

50:23.141 --> 50:25.754
My mother always made me sit up straight.

50:25.854 --> 50:27.884
I'm grateful to your mother.

50:27.984 --> 50:30.187
And such attractive shoulders.

50:30.859 --> 50:33.728
Swimming was compulsory at high school.

50:33.828 --> 50:36.692
I'm grateful to the public school system.

50:36.792 --> 50:39.824
There's so much to be grateful for.

50:39.924 --> 50:42.211
And so little time to be grateful.

51:06.599 --> 51:11.350
Oh, I just remembered - I forgot
my toothbrush. I'd better go back for it.

51:12.111 --> 51:14.146
I always carry a spare.

51:14.246 --> 51:17.109
But it takes me months
to break in a new one.

51:17.209 --> 51:21.579
The Hindus use twigs,
they break them off the trees. We'll try that.

51:21.679 --> 51:24.874
- I'm going for a short walk.
- I'll go with you!

51:24.974 --> 51:27.173
Stay here. Make yourself comfortable.

51:27.273 --> 51:30.847
Philip! There's something
you should know about me.

51:30.947 --> 51:33.226
I have an uncle who's a socialist.

51:33.326 --> 51:38.284
I respect you for telling me
but what we have transcends all politics.

52:01.796 --> 52:04.596
- Hi.
- Hello.

52:04.886 --> 52:07.843
Er, my name's Harry Clark.

52:08.977 --> 52:11.222
Philip Shayne.

52:12.986 --> 52:15.438
I just got married this afternoon.

52:15.538 --> 52:18.613
Congratulations.
How do you like married life?

52:18.713 --> 52:20.451
I don't know yet.

52:24.927 --> 52:26.968
I, er, came out for a smoke.

52:28.350 --> 52:31.937
I thought I'd give Marie-Anne
some time to, er...

52:33.904 --> 52:38.028
Well, what is a decent interval
for a fella to stay away?

52:38.128 --> 52:40.281
How long have you been out here?

52:41.419 --> 52:44.626
- Two hours.
- That's as decent as you can get.

52:45.803 --> 52:47.845
Marie-Anne's kinda shy.

52:48.976 --> 52:53.892
I mean, psychologically,
I want her to feel secure.

52:54.780 --> 52:55.980
Harry?

52:58.287 --> 53:00.445
She sounds secure.

53:00.545 --> 53:03.879
Well, awfully nice to have met you.
G- Good night.

53:22.253 --> 53:24.372
Oh, good evening.

53:24.472 --> 53:26.507
Good evening.

53:29.559 --> 53:34.184
- Do we know each other?
- I'm Dr Richardson, the hotel physician.

53:34.284 --> 53:36.602
- Oh.
- I wouldn't go in just yet.

53:36.702 --> 53:40.740
- What happened?
- The lady called to ask if we'd any sedatives

53:40.840 --> 53:43.451
and she sounded agitated so I came up.

53:43.551 --> 53:47.418
- Is she all right?
- Nothing serious, just a case of nerves.

53:48.640 --> 53:51.676
May I ask a personal question, Mr Shayne?

53:51.776 --> 53:55.057
- Sure, go ahead.
- Is that Mrs Shayne in there?

53:55.157 --> 53:56.157
Er...

53:56.949 --> 53:57.949
no.

53:58.703 --> 54:03.500
That's strange, this reaction
is more common amongst married women.

54:10.059 --> 54:12.262
- Is he back yet?
- Yes.

54:12.362 --> 54:16.102
Don't let him come in!
I don't want him to see me like this.

54:16.202 --> 54:17.797
I won't.

54:17.992 --> 54:20.700
All of a sudden I started breaking out.

54:22.167 --> 54:25.286
I always get rashes when I'm nervous.

54:25.386 --> 54:27.790
The ointment will take care of that.

54:27.890 --> 54:29.929
Here, take this.

54:34.735 --> 54:37.854
And get some sleep.
I'll stop by in the morning.

54:37.954 --> 54:41.485
Thank you. Oh, Doctor!
Don't tell him about the rash.

54:41.585 --> 54:45.964
- Tell him I had a stroke or something.
- I'll be discreet.

54:46.885 --> 54:47.885
Oh!

54:51.979 --> 54:55.347
- How is she?
- Fine. Needs a good night's rest.

54:55.447 --> 54:57.313
Uninterrupted.

54:57.413 --> 54:58.859
Naturally.

54:58.959 --> 55:02.320
Had a case in 207 last week,
honeymoon couple.

55:02.420 --> 55:05.702
Lovely girl, barricaded herself
in the bathroom.

55:05.802 --> 55:09.001
Claimed her husband
was making advances toward her.

55:09.101 --> 55:13.344
- The man should be horsewhipped.
- They're just not prepared.

55:13.444 --> 55:16.475
We give them one semester
of home economics

55:16.575 --> 55:19.029
and expect Madame DuBarry.

55:31.894 --> 55:33.894
Mr Shayne?

55:36.194 --> 55:37.730
Yes, Cathy?

55:37.830 --> 55:41.153
- Mr Shayne, I'm sorry.
- You couldn't help it.

55:41.253 --> 55:45.493
But I don't want to ruin your evening.
You go out without me.

55:45.593 --> 55:47.496
It wouldn't be the same.

55:47.596 --> 55:50.712
Don't worry. We'll go back
to New York in the morning.

55:50.812 --> 55:53.298
I know you've gone to great expense.

55:53.398 --> 55:56.681
Plane, hotels, meals, tips...

55:56.781 --> 55:59.775
If you add it all up,
I'll be glad to pay half of it.

55:59.875 --> 56:02.237
We'll figure it out in the morning.

56:02.337 --> 56:05.867
Now, you get a good night's sleep,
I'll be on the couch.

56:05.967 --> 56:08.749
If you wake up and need anything,
just call me.

56:08.849 --> 56:11.841
I won't wake up.
Once I get in bed, I'm through.

56:11.941 --> 56:13.637
Yes, I know.

56:13.737 --> 56:16.598
- Will you be all right on the couch?
- Fine!

56:16.698 --> 56:21.819
If you have trouble falling asleep,
don't forget the hot milk and butter.

56:21.919 --> 56:23.955
This may be the night for it.

56:25.337 --> 56:27.913
- Good night.
- Good night.

56:29.136 --> 56:31.891
- Oh, Mr Shayne!
- Yes, Cathy?

56:33.353 --> 56:37.016
I just want you to know that, sick as I am,

56:37.116 --> 56:40.441
this has been
the most wonderful day of my life.

56:40.541 --> 56:42.364
I'll never forget it.

56:43.499 --> 56:45.541
Neither will I.

57:17.945 --> 57:20.019
Having trouble, too, huh?

57:20.119 --> 57:21.396
Well...

57:21.496 --> 57:25.535
Before you give them the mink coat
they all talk a big game.

57:25.635 --> 57:29.380
Now the lady gets headaches,
she prefers to be alone.

57:30.596 --> 57:33.509
- What did you do?
- I belted her.

57:33.609 --> 57:35.637
How about you?

57:35.737 --> 57:37.767
Right across the chops.

57:37.867 --> 57:41.729
- We got a lot in common.
- We could pass for brothers.

57:41.829 --> 57:43.988
Deal the cards.

57:46.337 --> 57:48.581
- Watch it, I cheat.
- So do I.

57:50.721 --> 57:56.178
And in view of its growth potential, I strongly
recommend purchase of said stock.

57:56.278 --> 58:00.187
Send a copy to Mr Shayne,
Victoria Hotel, Bermuda.

58:00.287 --> 58:03.036
- Yes, sir.
- Just a moment, Miss Jones.

58:04.332 --> 58:08.329
I've been very curious about
something for years.

58:08.429 --> 58:11.209
- Would you let your hair down?
- What?

58:11.309 --> 58:13.346
Let your hair down.

58:21.701 --> 58:23.945
Now take your glasses off.

58:27.212 --> 58:30.466
Strange, always seems to work
in the movies.

58:33.308 --> 58:36.677
- Miss Jones, do you see what I see?
- Where?

58:36.777 --> 58:40.526
It's a miracle. Joan of Arc put out the fire.

58:50.593 --> 58:53.462
- Things went pretty badly?
- Pretty badly.

58:53.562 --> 58:56.843
- It was a disaster?
- That's what I like about you,

58:56.943 --> 59:00.981
no matter what calamity befalls others,
you can still laugh about it.

59:01.081 --> 59:06.070
It's a victory for the little people. How often
does the sparrow down the hawk?

59:06.170 --> 59:09.247
The baron of the boudoir
shot down over Bermuda.

59:09.347 --> 59:13.503
- It had to happen sooner or later.
- I knew she was no ordinary woman.

59:13.603 --> 59:17.051
- She proved that all right.
- Something about her,

59:17.151 --> 59:19.139
purity, innocence, honour.

59:19.239 --> 59:23.732
- All virtues that drive a man to drink.
- What a lift this is for me.

59:23.832 --> 59:27.331
There'll be dancing in
Dr Gruber's office today.

59:28.839 --> 59:33.501
Excuse me, sir. Miss Timberlake
asked me to return these things to you.

59:33.601 --> 59:35.589
Thank you, Collins.

59:35.689 --> 59:38.177
Why do that?
Why didn't she just keep them?

59:38.277 --> 59:40.061
It upsets you, doesn't it?

59:40.161 --> 59:45.278
The puppet master ran across a puppet who
won't perform and then cuts all his strings.

59:45.378 --> 59:50.035
She's become a symbol of hope to
all of us who sold out for that touch of mink.

59:50.135 --> 59:51.332
Roger!

59:51.594 --> 59:55.007
You give us good salaries,
paid vacations, insurance,

59:55.107 --> 59:58.802
you take away our problems
and act like you've done us a favour.

59:58.902 --> 01:00:02.147
Well, you haven't
and some day there'll be an uprising

01:00:02.247 --> 01:00:05.821
and the masses will regain
the misery they're entitled to.

01:00:05.921 --> 01:00:10.456
Neurotics of the world unite. You have
nothing to lose but your psychiatrist.

01:00:10.556 --> 01:00:14.796
Roger, I flew 800 miles
to a tropical paradise

01:00:14.896 --> 01:00:16.927
to drink hot milk and butter.

01:00:17.027 --> 01:00:22.062
I spent half the night playing gin rummy
with a bookie. Not a memorable evening.

01:00:22.162 --> 01:00:25.070
If you don't leave now, I'll raise your salary.

01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:27.365
You're sadistic enough to do that.

01:00:27.465 --> 01:00:30.744
If Miss Timberlake is your hope,
you get together with her.

01:00:30.844 --> 01:00:34.260
You, she and Dr Gruber
will make a lovely couple.

01:00:48.085 --> 01:00:52.965
You go back home for a few days
and see your family, you'll feel better.

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:57.219
I don't want to feel better. I don't deserve it.

01:00:58.356 --> 01:01:03.147
I was afraid of him.
I thought I wasn't good enough for him.

01:01:03.247 --> 01:01:05.398
Afraid I'd disappoint him.

01:01:05.498 --> 01:01:09.158
So? You weren't asking for
a letter of recommendation.

01:01:09.258 --> 01:01:13.083
The minute he bolted that door I got panicky.

01:01:13.183 --> 01:01:17.130
Of course. You're alone in a hotel room
with a strange man,

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:19.469
what would the average girl do?

01:01:19.569 --> 01:01:24.940
Forget about the average girl, somebody as
sensitive as you are is bound to get nervous.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.737
Nervous? I broke out in a rash.

01:01:28.837 --> 01:01:30.704
I know, I know.

01:01:30.804 --> 01:01:33.544
I had exactly the same experience once.

01:01:33.644 --> 01:01:38.677
This fellow and I stopped off
at a roadside inn - never forget it.

01:01:38.777 --> 01:01:41.935
Started shaking like a leaf,
broke out in boils.

01:01:42.035 --> 01:01:45.865
He was so sick I had to drive him home.
It happens to everybody.

01:01:46.997 --> 01:01:49.200
He was so understanding about it.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.335
He didn't even get upset.

01:01:52.467 --> 01:01:54.502
He just smiled.

01:01:54.602 --> 01:01:57.048
It was so awful!

01:01:57.148 --> 01:01:59.928
If only he'd got mad or yelled or hit me.

01:02:00.028 --> 01:02:04.148
- Men are so inconsiderate.
- And all that money he spent on me,

01:02:04.248 --> 01:02:07.154
he can't even deduct it, it's humiliating.

01:02:07.254 --> 01:02:08.572
What is?

01:02:08.672 --> 01:02:12.669
I'm not even important enough
to be a tax loss.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:21.524
- Good morning, Roger.
- Morning, Doctor.

01:02:25.201 --> 01:02:27.108
It's good to be home.

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:30.618
How are things in the investment world?
Any good tips?

01:02:30.718 --> 01:02:35.336
A new stock issue, Consolidated Wire.
It's a great buy if you get in fast.

01:02:35.436 --> 01:02:41.099
I still haven't heard from my mother, not that
it bothers me but it has been two days.

01:02:41.199 --> 01:02:45.400
I know what's wrong, she's in a snit.
I forgot Grandpa's birthday.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.111
She has a real problem with her father.

01:02:48.211 --> 01:02:50.409
Let her analyst worry about that.

01:02:50.509 --> 01:02:55.882
Doc, an exciting thing happened,
I think I'm about to make a breakthrough.

01:02:57.141 --> 01:03:00.971
I made a great discovery,
Philip Shayne is just a man!

01:03:01.071 --> 01:03:03.101
It took a woman to prove it.

01:03:03.201 --> 01:03:08.236
There's this girl, let's call her...
Cathy Timberlake...

01:03:08.336 --> 01:03:12.713
Walter? Dr Gruber.
What's Consolidated Wire?

01:03:13.926 --> 01:03:15.961
12 and a half.

01:03:16.061 --> 01:03:18.180
Buy me... 500 shares.

01:03:19.312 --> 01:03:21.597
Yes, I got it from the usual source.

01:03:21.697 --> 01:03:24.644
The way she stood up to him was inspiring.

01:03:24.744 --> 01:03:28.947
I kept thinking what would I have done
if I were in her shoes.

01:03:29.047 --> 01:03:31.082
Unemployed, no money.

01:03:33.424 --> 01:03:37.715
This very wealthy man
sees me walking down the street,

01:03:37.815 --> 01:03:40.299
he's terribly attracted to me.

01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:45.104
Had me brought up to his office,
I have to admit he's quite charming.

01:03:45.204 --> 01:03:48.778
After the usual preliminaries -
dinner and dancing -

01:03:48.878 --> 01:03:52.286
- he invites me to Bermuda.
- Just like that?

01:03:52.386 --> 01:03:56.543
This is a forceful man,
accustomed to getting his own way.

01:03:56.643 --> 01:03:58.038
Uh-huh.

01:03:58.308 --> 01:04:01.677
Get given a complete wardrobe,
including a mink coat,

01:04:01.777 --> 01:04:06.604
flown to Bermuda, taken to the best suite,
this man offers everything.

01:04:06.704 --> 01:04:08.986
Excitement, comfort, security.

01:04:09.086 --> 01:04:12.866
Believe me, Doc, it's not easy
to turn down an offer like that.

01:04:12.966 --> 01:04:14.999
No, it's not.

01:04:15.099 --> 01:04:17.961
Roger, something
quite urgent has come up.

01:04:18.061 --> 01:04:21.220
- Would you mind cutting the session short?
- No.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.144
I want to see you in the morning.
We should examine this new development.

01:04:25.244 --> 01:04:28.191
- Exciting, isn't it?
- Yes, that's...

01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:30.614
quite a breakthrough you've made.

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:35.459
Walter, Dr Gruber.
Cancel that order for Consolidated Wire.

01:04:35.559 --> 01:04:40.931
My informant has developed instabilities
which make his judgement questionable.

01:04:42.858 --> 01:04:45.310
Tell me when you're coming back
and I'll meet you.

01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:50.867
- I will. Better hurry, you'll be late for work.
- I know. Have a good trip. Bye.

01:04:58.682 --> 01:04:59.682
Bye.

01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:05.227
Cathy! How did you miss the bus?
You were on it.

01:05:05.327 --> 01:05:07.190
I've changed my mind.

01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:10.613
- We can still catch it.
- I've got to go back there.

01:05:10.713 --> 01:05:15.370
You are the husband, four children
and a cottage type, this isn't you.

01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:18.463
You got lucky once,
it may not be a rash this time.

01:05:18.563 --> 01:05:23.636
I can't let him think of me as I was last night.
I want him to remember me as a woman.

01:05:23.736 --> 01:05:27.435
It's important to me,
I've got to prove to him I'm a woman.

01:05:27.535 --> 01:05:30.197
There are easier ways to prove it.

01:05:30.297 --> 01:05:32.331
Send him your birth certificate.

01:05:36.301 --> 01:05:41.048
Mr Shayne, a long-distance phone call.
It came through from your office.

01:05:41.148 --> 01:05:43.469
- Who is it? Do you know?
- No, sir.

01:05:43.569 --> 01:05:45.644
All right. Thank you, Mario.

01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:50.236
- Hello?
- Philip, this is Cathy.

01:05:51.416 --> 01:05:53.451
'Guess where I am.'

01:05:53.551 --> 01:05:55.036
Disneyland?

01:05:55.136 --> 01:05:58.667
Bermuda. At the hotel.

01:05:58.767 --> 01:06:00.550
What are you doing there?

01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:02.971
Waiting for you.

01:06:04.192 --> 01:06:08.938
I already have plans for the evening.
I have a few things to catch up on.

01:06:09.038 --> 01:06:12.154
You could be here in two hours.

01:06:12.254 --> 01:06:15.753
And I have a board meeting early tomorrow.

01:06:19.974 --> 01:06:23.513
Is that what you'd rather see
first thing in the morning?

01:06:27.281 --> 01:06:29.316
That is something to think about.

01:06:29.416 --> 01:06:32.740
And it's all just two hours away.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.869
Er, just a minute.

01:06:34.969 --> 01:06:39.254
Isabella, I have
a hypothetical question to ask you.

01:06:39.354 --> 01:06:43.638
Darling, what would you do
if the situation were reversed?

01:06:43.738 --> 01:06:45.131
Grazie.

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:47.486
I'm on my way.

01:07:03.021 --> 01:07:06.306
Sorry to keep you this late
but just one more letter.

01:07:06.406 --> 01:07:10.149
To the Dean of Economics Department,
Princeton University.

01:07:10.249 --> 01:07:12.991
Dear Arnold, after an absence of six years

01:07:13.091 --> 01:07:17.458
I'm happy to announce I will soon be
returning to the academic world.

01:07:17.558 --> 01:07:21.925
It is my intention to fill the void
created by my leaving...

01:07:22.025 --> 01:07:24.092
- Oh, Collins.
- Yes, sir?

01:07:24.192 --> 01:07:27.474
- Taking everything back?
- Oh, no, the airport.

01:07:27.574 --> 01:07:32.234
Mr Shayne is flying to Bermuda.
He's meeting Miss Timberlake.

01:07:32.334 --> 01:07:33.334
Oh.

01:07:34.252 --> 01:07:36.252
Thank you.

01:07:45.567 --> 01:07:49.691
Thank you, Miss Jones.
We'll finish in the morning.

01:07:49.791 --> 01:07:52.028
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:07:56.297 --> 01:08:01.043
Dr Gruber? Roger. I hate to bother you
but something's come up.

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:04.343
- Remember what I told you this morning?
- 'Yes.'

01:08:04.443 --> 01:08:07.602
- It's happening again.
- 'A trip to Bermuda?'

01:08:07.702 --> 01:08:09.524
Yes, tonight.

01:08:21.808 --> 01:08:24.051
You don't scare me.

01:08:56.212 --> 01:08:59.216
- Good evening, Mr Shayne.
- Good evening.

01:09:14.791 --> 01:09:15.991
Cathy.

01:09:24.435 --> 01:09:25.636
Cathy?

01:09:26.482 --> 01:09:27.682
Cathy.

01:09:33.246 --> 01:09:34.446
Cathy!

01:09:36.837 --> 01:09:37.837
Hi!

01:09:46.481 --> 01:09:49.189
See... no rash.

01:09:52.118 --> 01:09:54.160
Well, that's something.

01:10:01.178 --> 01:10:03.630
Cathy. Cathy...

01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:06.928
Cathy! Did you drink this whole bottle?

01:10:07.028 --> 01:10:09.098
Beats hot milk and butter.

01:10:09.198 --> 01:10:11.195
Oh, for...

01:10:11.491 --> 01:10:13.527
Come on, girl. Come on.

01:10:13.627 --> 01:10:15.656
Come on, let's sit up.

01:10:15.756 --> 01:10:18.588
There's a good girl. Sit up. That's right.

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:23.213
- Are you glad you came here?
- Delighted. Come on.

01:10:23.313 --> 01:10:26.220
I bet you never expected
to hear from me again.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.432
Oh, I had a premonition.

01:10:28.532 --> 01:10:30.568
- Can you stand up?
- Yeah!

01:10:30.739 --> 01:10:31.739
Good.

01:10:33.745 --> 01:10:37.786
- I'm a real woman, huh?
- Yeah, irresistible.

01:10:37.886 --> 01:10:39.914
Now, try to walk.

01:10:40.014 --> 01:10:42.127
That's the idea.

01:10:42.227 --> 01:10:44.512
There you are, that's right.

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:48.177
Do you like the way I walk?

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.433
You're poetry in motion.

01:10:50.533 --> 01:10:52.898
- I learned when I was a baby.
- Uh-huh.

01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:55.321
- I been walking for years.
- Oh.

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:58.425
Oh, dear.

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:03.797
- Have you been drinking?
- Not yet.

01:11:03.897 --> 01:11:06.301
Right, come on.

01:11:08.066 --> 01:11:10.939
There. Now, just stand there, don't move.

01:11:12.074 --> 01:11:14.116
Are you nervous?

01:11:15.164 --> 01:11:17.032
Petrified.

01:11:17.132 --> 01:11:21.294
Now, take a breath of fresh air.
Come on, take a deep breath.

01:11:23.932 --> 01:11:26.467
Is that good? Fine... Oop!

01:11:26.567 --> 01:11:29.138
Now, just stand there. That's right.

01:11:30.654 --> 01:11:33.439
I'll call down and get some coffee.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.613
Room service, please. Hurry.

01:11:36.749 --> 01:11:41.163
Hello, this is Philip Shayne.
Send up some hot coffee right away.

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:43.294
As much as you can carry.

01:11:43.394 --> 01:11:46.558
I need a chaser for a fifth of Scotch. Yes, I...

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:57.450
Don't move! Lie there.

01:11:57.550 --> 01:11:59.342
Oh, dear.

01:12:04.724 --> 01:12:08.637
I fell out of Mr Shayne's suite.
See that I'm returned.

01:12:08.737 --> 01:12:13.395
Luckily, the canopy broke her fall.
Nothing but a sprained wrist.

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:17.360
- Where's Mr Shayne?
- Wandered off. Seems to be in shock.

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:21.288
Can't say I blame him,
the girl's hysterical one evening

01:12:21.388 --> 01:12:23.835
and plunges off his balcony the next.

01:12:23.935 --> 01:12:27.884
Their relationship does
leave something to be desired.

01:12:30.401 --> 01:12:32.645
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:36.247 --> 01:12:39.782
- I thought you left this morning.
- I did. Flew back.

01:12:39.882 --> 01:12:42.081
How's the little lady?

01:12:42.181 --> 01:12:44.583
Got another headache. How's yours?

01:12:44.683 --> 01:12:46.671
Got loaded. Fell off the balcony.

01:12:46.771 --> 01:12:50.515
I'm glad I book horses.
Who can handicap women?

01:12:50.615 --> 01:12:53.440
- Can't win.
- Why do we keep betting on them?

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:57.990
It's like Adam said about Eve -
"It's better than apples."

01:12:58.090 --> 01:13:00.241
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:02.379
Deal the cards.

01:13:08.354 --> 01:13:10.812
Thank you. Miss Jones, look!

01:13:14.575 --> 01:13:16.778
The hawk has crashed again.

01:13:16.878 --> 01:13:22.996
Call Dr Gruber. Cancel my appointment.
Tell him things worked out well in Bermuda.

01:13:23.096 --> 01:13:28.223
You can't just sit there for
the rest of your life staring out the window.

01:13:29.523 --> 01:13:33.981
Catherine, darling, look.
I've baked you a kugel. Eat.

01:13:34.081 --> 01:13:36.064
You need strength to suffer.

01:13:36.164 --> 01:13:38.908
Believe me, no man is worth it.

01:13:39.008 --> 01:13:43.247
You'll see, you'll get a job, work for 20 years

01:13:43.347 --> 01:13:46.347
and then you'll get a pension,
who needs him?

01:13:48.687 --> 01:13:50.306
Well, say something.

01:13:50.406 --> 01:13:52.857
I just wanna die.

01:13:54.157 --> 01:13:59.322
- Did you hear that? She wants to die.
- Maybe it'll make her feel better.

01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:03.672
No, no. Don't call one.

01:14:05.012 --> 01:14:10.303
We better wait. I had a traumatic experience
driving in the rain the other day.

01:14:10.403 --> 01:14:14.183
- Anything serious?
- No, just left me a little puddle-shy.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.317
Let me ask you a question.

01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:19.741
If you saw a stray kitten,
helpless but very appealing,

01:14:19.841 --> 01:14:23.997
and every time you tried to pet it
you got scratched, would you avoid it?

01:14:24.097 --> 01:14:27.212
- Naturally.
- Yet you can't leave it to starve,

01:14:27.312 --> 01:14:30.593
you've got a moral obligation
to help it survive.

01:14:30.693 --> 01:14:34.558
- What does this kitten do?
- Works a computing machine.

01:14:34.658 --> 01:14:38.441
We own American Credit Card,
they use those machines.

01:14:38.541 --> 01:14:41.408
Arrange for a job but keep my name out of it.

01:14:41.508 --> 01:14:45.458
- How do we contact this kitten?
- With extreme caution.

01:14:46.932 --> 01:14:51.723
Don't worry, you go to work.
I'll check and see that she's all right.

01:14:51.823 --> 01:14:54.393
Boy, if I ever run across him again.

01:15:09.728 --> 01:15:13.148
- Excuse me, could you tell me...
- With pleasure.

01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:26.753
- What's wrong?
- It's him.

01:15:26.853 --> 01:15:28.247
You...!

01:15:37.619 --> 01:15:39.277
What happened?

01:15:39.377 --> 01:15:41.908
Don't ask, get Herman.

01:15:42.008 --> 01:15:44.622
Herman. Herman!

01:15:44.722 --> 01:15:46.836
Herman, come here.

01:15:46.936 --> 01:15:48.342
Get him!

01:16:02.921 --> 01:16:04.707
What happened?

01:16:04.807 --> 01:16:08.932
I was knocked down two flights of stairs
and attacked by a dog.

01:16:10.269 --> 01:16:13.349
This has been the
most satisfying day of my life.

01:16:13.449 --> 01:16:15.184
What started it?

01:16:15.284 --> 01:16:19.232
When the cab crashed and
the women started hitting me, I found out.

01:16:19.332 --> 01:16:23.243
They had nothing against me,
they thought they were hitting you.

01:16:23.343 --> 01:16:27.751
Before I go to the hospital I wanted you
to see what people think of you.

01:16:27.851 --> 01:16:30.257
And you deserved everything I got.

01:16:35.154 --> 01:16:37.195
I wonder what I've done.

01:16:38.953 --> 01:16:40.860
The whole world's on credit

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:45.748
and I'm going with a man who won't
get married till he can pay for it in cash.

01:16:45.848 --> 01:16:50.589
I told him people charge everything -
hotels, department stores.

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:53.093
Some places won't even take money.

01:16:53.193 --> 01:16:57.442
One of these days they'll even
charge funerals - die now, pay later.

01:17:03.211 --> 01:17:07.502
Stanley's cousin's in town.
We could make it a foursome tonight.

01:17:07.602 --> 01:17:12.092
Thanks, but I have to start billing
the New England area tomorrow.

01:17:12.192 --> 01:17:14.807
I need to memorise these code numbers.

01:17:14.907 --> 01:17:19.110
Well, that'll be more interesting
than Stanley's cousin.

01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:21.494
- See you in the morning.
- Night.

01:17:24.422 --> 01:17:27.418
How do you like working here,
Miss Timberlake?

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:30.047
Fine, thank you. I just hope I do well.

01:17:30.147 --> 01:17:35.099
And if you don't, who's going to fire you?
My friend works in personnel.

01:17:35.199 --> 01:17:40.190
When the call came from Mr Shayne's
office to hire you it was like panicsville.

01:17:40.290 --> 01:17:43.784
Have you ever seen
a herd of vice presidents stampede?

01:17:43.884 --> 01:17:46.452
Mr Shayne recommended me for this job?

01:17:46.552 --> 01:17:51.175
Recommended? Honey, you are in
for a labour-management relationship

01:17:51.275 --> 01:17:53.471
Walter Reuther never dreamed of.

01:17:53.571 --> 01:17:57.433
If you sneeze, they tear out
the air conditioning system.

01:17:57.533 --> 01:18:00.195
Well, that's life.

01:18:00.295 --> 01:18:02.531
I'm glad one of us girls made it.

01:18:11.142 --> 01:18:14.472
You don't have to
feel sorry for me, Mr Shayne.

01:18:14.572 --> 01:18:17.404
I'll get my own job. I don't need your help.

01:18:18.533 --> 01:18:22.446
If I never work again,
at least I've done it on my own.

01:18:22.546 --> 01:18:25.871
I'm not like these machines
where you push a button

01:18:25.971 --> 01:18:28.122
and it does what you want it to do.

01:18:28.222 --> 01:18:31.338
Push all you want,
you're not gonna push my buttons.

01:18:31.438 --> 01:18:33.762
I'm not a robot, I'm people.

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:36.479
And I quit!

01:19:01.955 --> 01:19:04.496
- Telephone, Mr Shayne.
- Thank you, Mario.

01:19:06.256 --> 01:19:07.456
Hello?

01:19:09.846 --> 01:19:11.971
She did what to the machines?

01:19:12.978 --> 01:19:14.937
I'll be right there.

01:19:15.942 --> 01:19:19.561
This is how I found it
when the night watchman called me.

01:19:19.661 --> 01:19:24.155
It's awful. Buffalo gone.
Hartford, Connecticut almost wiped out.

01:19:24.255 --> 01:19:26.293
31,000 accounts.

01:19:27.591 --> 01:19:31.292
This man had breakfast
at a Howard Johnson drive-in,

01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:33.676
he's being billed for $128,000.

01:19:33.776 --> 01:19:37.055
Hm, it's that second cup of coffee
that gets you.

01:19:37.155 --> 01:19:39.688
It'll take weeks to straighten out.

01:19:39.788 --> 01:19:41.985
Do the best you can.

01:19:42.085 --> 01:19:45.909
It's sabotage! She's an undercover agent
for the Diners Club.

01:19:46.009 --> 01:19:49.250
No. No, I'm the one who placed
this atom bomb here.

01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:52.265
I should have dropped her over the desert.

01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:56.348
I've no one to blame but myself.

01:19:56.448 --> 01:20:02.527
I felt sorry for this helpless kitten. Helpless?
She ought to be declared a disaster area.

01:20:02.627 --> 01:20:07.701
- She's not the run-of-the-mill girl, is she?
- No. Even Darwin never figured on her.

01:20:07.801 --> 01:20:10.962
The Four Horsemen
now have a riding companion.

01:20:11.062 --> 01:20:15.718
There's War, Famine, Death,
Pestilence and Miss Timberlake.

01:20:15.818 --> 01:20:19.600
Sir, this special delivery letter
just came for you.

01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:21.523
Thank you.

01:20:21.623 --> 01:20:24.243
- It's from her.
- Open it.

01:20:25.376 --> 01:20:29.129
- I should put it in a tub of water.
- Go on, open it.

01:20:30.261 --> 01:20:32.802
Calm down, I'm opening it.

01:20:34.979 --> 01:20:36.979
"Dear sir,

01:20:37.192 --> 01:20:42.816
"Enclosed is an itemised statement of
all expenses incurred by you on my behalf.

01:20:42.916 --> 01:20:47.659
"This includes plane fare, hotel,
meals, tips and doctor's bills,

01:20:47.759 --> 01:20:50.919
"which comes to a total of $729.40.

01:20:51.019 --> 01:20:55.720
"It is only an estimate.
If your figure differs, please let me know.

01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:59.182
"Enclosed is money order
covering first payment."

01:20:59.282 --> 01:21:02.148
- Three dollars?
- That's integrity.

01:21:02.248 --> 01:21:06.240
"You will receive a money order
for a similar amount each week

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:09.287
"until the entire obligation is discharged.

01:21:09.387 --> 01:21:14.130
"With best wishes for
your continued success, Cathy Timberlake."

01:21:14.230 --> 01:21:16.973
What a future, three dollars a week for life.

01:21:17.073 --> 01:21:21.107
- I think it's touching. She has character.
- She's a menace.

01:21:21.207 --> 01:21:24.901
Roger, I'm a man who leads
an orderly life, you know that.

01:21:25.001 --> 01:21:27.618
I close doors and tighten bottle tops.

01:21:27.718 --> 01:21:31.626
Miss Timberlake is a bottle
wandering around with a loose top.

01:21:31.726 --> 01:21:35.467
She can't hold a job,
she destroys everything she touches.

01:21:35.567 --> 01:21:39.392
She should get married. Only a husband
is equipped for such a beating.

01:21:39.492 --> 01:21:43.400
That's it. Roger, you have plenty of friends,
find her a husband.

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.780
A simple, dull, unimaginative man

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:50.788
who will smile tolerantly when he learns
she's misplaced the children.

01:21:50.888 --> 01:21:53.557
Return it, mark it address unknown.

01:22:08.672 --> 01:22:11.418
Dr Gruber? Roger.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

01:22:11.518 --> 01:22:17.180
Not at all. I received your message.
Things worked out well in Bermuda?

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:21.019
There's been a fantastic development!
He's mentioned marriage.

01:22:21.119 --> 01:22:23.860
And how do you feel about this?

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:28.577
Naturally, I'm delighted. He just left me
and I tell you this is the real thing.

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:29.871
I see.

01:22:31.928 --> 01:22:34.967
Roger, I'll be away for a while.

01:22:36.395 --> 01:22:40.611
I think I'd better go back to Vienna
for a refresher course.

01:22:43.159 --> 01:22:45.944
He doesn't love me,
he just feels sorry for me.

01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:48.909
Doesn't love you?
He compared you to the plague.

01:22:49.009 --> 01:22:52.873
- What else could it be?
- He wants me to marry another man.

01:22:52.973 --> 01:22:57.804
I drew up a list of 20 eligible bachelors
and turned he them all down. Why?

01:22:59.568 --> 01:23:04.026
This one had a low hairline
and this one graduated from Purdue.

01:23:04.126 --> 01:23:06.609
- He even turned him down.
- Rock Hudson?

01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:09.660
He said you'd have to live in California.

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:14.669
When he talks about a simple, dull,
unimaginative husband, he means himself.

01:23:14.769 --> 01:23:16.923
He didn't say he was in love.

01:23:17.023 --> 01:23:20.889
It's like having a baby,
the man is always the last one to know.

01:23:20.989 --> 01:23:25.111
And how do we awaken him?
Not with a kiss but with a sledgehammer.

01:23:25.211 --> 01:23:28.867
- But I'm going away with Beasley.
- It has to be a Beasley.

01:23:28.967 --> 01:23:31.747
- If he's as repulsive as you say.
- Worse.

01:23:31.847 --> 01:23:36.089
- How about running away with you?
- No, he'd admire your choice.

01:23:36.189 --> 01:23:38.259
It has to be someone inferior.

01:23:38.359 --> 01:23:43.186
To shatter Philip's ego you have go off
with the lowest human you can find.

01:23:43.286 --> 01:23:47.741
That's Beasley. He's so low
when they bury him they'll have to dig up.

01:23:47.841 --> 01:23:51.535
- Mr Beasley, please.
- We're doing this for Philip,

01:23:51.635 --> 01:23:53.918
it's for his own good, and yours too.

01:23:54.018 --> 01:23:56.760
He's a very nice man
and I'm the last one to admit it.

01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:01.227
Even if it worked, it wouldn't be honest.
I'd be tricking him.

01:24:01.327 --> 01:24:04.272
- It's a terrible way to get a man.
- Let's re-examine...

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:06.025
Stop pressing her.

01:24:06.125 --> 01:24:11.245
You have now arrived at the crossroads
that every woman eventually arrives at,

01:24:11.345 --> 01:24:15.473
you can either be an honest old maid
or a happy liar.

01:24:19.315 --> 01:24:21.690
- 'Hello?'
- Hello.

01:24:23.991 --> 01:24:26.033
This is Catherine Timberlake.

01:24:27.958 --> 01:24:29.786
Well, hello there.

01:24:33.177 --> 01:24:34.777
Come on.

01:24:35.181 --> 01:24:37.844
I've been thinking about you.

01:24:37.944 --> 01:24:44.022
'I wonder if I could, er,
reconsider your invitation, Everett.'

01:24:44.122 --> 01:24:46.324
I'm not one to hold grudges.

01:24:48.082 --> 01:24:49.657
Tonight?

01:24:49.757 --> 01:24:52.871
We could have a TV dinner
at my apartment.

01:24:52.971 --> 01:24:54.542
Asbury Park.

01:24:54.642 --> 01:25:00.148
Er, I've heard of this charming place
in, er Asbury Park.

01:25:01.192 --> 01:25:03.390
It's, er...

01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:05.115
Al's Motel.

01:25:06.954 --> 01:25:10.701
That's a long drive.
What time do you have to be home?

01:25:10.801 --> 01:25:11.801
Oh...

01:25:13.217 --> 01:25:15.093
it all depends.

01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:17.547
On what?

01:25:17.647 --> 01:25:20.443
Oh... Everett.

01:25:24.783 --> 01:25:28.915
- I'll borrow my brother-in-law's car.
- Pick me up at five.

01:25:30.002 --> 01:25:32.293
And I'll be waiting... Everett.

01:25:34.636 --> 01:25:38.549
Ooh! He's like a snake.
When he smiles, he rattles.

01:25:38.649 --> 01:25:41.891
He'll pick you up at five
and at one minute past five

01:25:41.991 --> 01:25:44.770
I'll drop the bombshell on Mr Shayne's lap.

01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:50.157
- What if he doesn't follow us?
- We're dealing with a monumental ego.

01:25:50.257 --> 01:25:52.828
You'll never get halfway to Asbury Park.

01:25:55.638 --> 01:25:59.805
My brother-in-law's car is
being repaired but he let me have this.

01:26:05.616 --> 01:26:09.749
On the way back we have to make
a delivery for him in Hoboken.

01:26:38.893 --> 01:26:41.051
- You've got to follow her.
- Why?

01:26:41.151 --> 01:26:46.105
She's going away with another man.
She's lost her confidence with you.

01:26:46.205 --> 01:26:48.946
OK, send her a box of confidence.

01:26:49.046 --> 01:26:51.741
Don't you realise what will happen?

01:26:51.841 --> 01:26:55.916
Nothing will happen, I speak as a veteran
of two Bermuda campaigns.

01:26:56.016 --> 01:26:58.047
But she's in love with you.

01:26:58.147 --> 01:27:01.760
- She has a fine way of showing it.
- She's afraid of you.

01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:05.142
- What does that mean?
- She's not afraid of him.

01:27:05.242 --> 01:27:08.777
She doesn't care what he thinks.
That's how it happens.

01:27:10.708 --> 01:27:12.750
Get my clothes.

01:27:13.923 --> 01:27:16.927
Get me a hairbrush, a comb,
get me everything.

01:27:21.689 --> 01:27:24.725
- Where's my driver?
- He went out to eat, sir.

01:27:24.825 --> 01:27:27.023
- Who sent him to eat?
- You did.

01:27:27.123 --> 01:27:28.123
Cab!

01:27:33.505 --> 01:27:36.418
Asbury Park. Al's Motel.

01:27:36.518 --> 01:27:38.553
This girl I've gotta see.

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:43.730
Go on, hurry.

01:27:44.361 --> 01:27:48.858
- Who is this man?
- He's a clerk at the unemployment office.

01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:50.822
How naive can she be?

01:27:50.922 --> 01:27:54.784
What does she think
he's taking her there for? An aptitude test?

01:27:54.884 --> 01:27:58.962
Haven't you ever seen a man dress before?
Give me my shirt.

01:27:59.062 --> 01:28:04.220
Al's Motel! Sounds like a place
where you bring your own light bulbs.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:08.693
- Why would she do that?
- He's a man and she's a woman.

01:28:08.793 --> 01:28:13.203
That's the most dangerous combination
to turn loose in a motel.

01:28:16.969 --> 01:28:18.929
Please, keep your eye on the road.

01:28:26.572 --> 01:28:30.652
When I called for the reservation
I talked to the proprietor.

01:28:30.752 --> 01:28:35.327
He said we could use the burner
in his kitchen to heat up the TV dinners.

01:28:35.427 --> 01:28:37.466
We're having haddock.

01:28:38.555 --> 01:28:40.962
Would you like a drink?

01:28:41.062 --> 01:28:43.846
Oh, yes. That'd be fine. Let's stop for one.

01:28:43.946 --> 01:28:47.271
No need to. I thought of everything.

01:28:47.371 --> 01:28:49.941
Muscatel. For my lady's pleasure.

01:28:52.417 --> 01:28:56.336
There's some paper cups
in the glove compartment.

01:28:58.763 --> 01:29:02.677
Would you mind stopping at
the service station for a minute?

01:29:02.777 --> 01:29:04.850
Oh, of course.

01:29:22.813 --> 01:29:27.187
- Can't you go any faster?
- This cab's got 300,000 miles on her.

01:29:27.287 --> 01:29:30.943
Would you ask your grandmother
to run the high hurdles?

01:29:31.043 --> 01:29:34.368
Why am I chasing her?
I should be grateful to the man.

01:29:34.468 --> 01:29:36.248
Freud had a theory about that.

01:29:36.348 --> 01:29:40.715
If he'd ever met this girl,
he'd have opened a delicatessen.

01:29:40.815 --> 01:29:41.815
Yes.

01:29:42.228 --> 01:29:44.472
Freud's Famous Frankfurters.

01:29:53.417 --> 01:29:56.414
Would you mind pulling into that station?

01:29:56.514 --> 01:29:57.514
Sure.

01:30:19.304 --> 01:30:23.383
- That convertible ahead, catch up to it.
- I'm doing 70 now.

01:30:23.483 --> 01:30:25.514
I'll burn out a bearing.

01:30:25.614 --> 01:30:27.977
Maybe they'll stop off for dinner.

01:30:28.077 --> 01:30:33.202
When a girl's taken to a place called
Al's Motel, she better not count on dinner.

01:31:02.225 --> 01:31:03.825
Amazing.

01:31:10.075 --> 01:31:13.321
I told you she wouldn't make it. She's gone.

01:31:13.421 --> 01:31:17.873
We'll see that she gets a decent burial.
Roger, give him a cheque.

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:21.255
First phone for another cab.
He'll be right back.

01:31:29.657 --> 01:31:31.942
- Do you know Asbury Park?
- Yeah.

01:31:32.042 --> 01:31:34.950
- A place called Al's Motel?
- Yeah.

01:31:35.050 --> 01:31:37.367
50 bucks if you get me there.

01:31:37.467 --> 01:31:39.673
Well, it's a little out of my way.

01:31:40.763 --> 01:31:41.763
Here.

01:31:42.433 --> 01:31:45.105
- Hop in the back.
- Right. In the...? Oh.

01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:11.950
Oh!

01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:28.267
But there's the motel,
we'll be in in a few minutes.

01:32:28.367 --> 01:32:30.935
You register and I'll meet you inside.

01:32:31.035 --> 01:32:35.035
OK. But when you get back to New York,
you ought to have a checkup.

01:32:47.859 --> 01:32:49.933
- This is it.
- Thank you.

01:32:50.033 --> 01:32:52.437
A man spends an entire lifetime

01:32:52.537 --> 01:32:58.326
trying to lead a civilised, dignified,
orderly existence and then he meets a girl,

01:32:58.426 --> 01:33:01.874
five days later he's running round
New York in a bath towel,

01:33:01.974 --> 01:33:05.006
riding in a truck filled with dead chickens,

01:33:05.106 --> 01:33:08.305
tracking her down to
this beaverboard Taj Mahal.

01:33:08.405 --> 01:33:11.520
And poets call it love.
No wonder they starve.

01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:14.240
Oh, the nuts you pick up on the road.

01:33:15.415 --> 01:33:17.240
- Hi.
- How do you do?

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:21.249
Did a couple just register here?
A blonde about so high?

01:33:21.349 --> 01:33:24.257
Yeah! About ten minutes ago.
Mr and Mrs Smith.

01:33:24.357 --> 01:33:27.719
- That's them.
- Are you a friend of the happy couple?

01:33:27.819 --> 01:33:29.768
I gave the bride away.

01:33:29.868 --> 01:33:34.825
- They're in the bridal suite. I'll ring them.
- No. Let me surprise them.

01:33:42.554 --> 01:33:44.507
Oh. All right, where is she?

01:33:44.607 --> 01:33:46.469
- Who?
- Mrs Smith.

01:33:46.569 --> 01:33:49.353
- She's in there, changing.
- Into what?

01:33:51.656 --> 01:33:53.564
Now just a moment.

01:33:53.664 --> 01:33:55.568
What she ever saw in you...

01:33:55.668 --> 01:33:58.239
- Come out of there!
- What right have you got?

01:33:58.339 --> 01:34:02.122
Every right. I least I took her to a hotel,
not a rabbit hutch.

01:34:02.222 --> 01:34:05.883
- She went to a hotel with you?
- She collects hotel keys.

01:34:05.983 --> 01:34:08.019
Are you coming out?

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.907
Congratulations, my friend.
You've got a great little girl there.

01:34:19.714 --> 01:34:21.833
Who was that man?

01:34:21.933 --> 01:34:24.634
You librarians live it up pretty good.

01:34:25.601 --> 01:34:29.181
He didn't follow me and Beasley's
checking in. What shall I do?

01:34:29.281 --> 01:34:31.600
Don't fall apart, keep your head.

01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:33.899
Remember your girl scout training.

01:34:33.999 --> 01:34:36.529
We never covered a situation like this.

01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:39.114
Stall for time. Go to the ladies' room.

01:34:39.214 --> 01:34:43.670
I already hit every gas station
between Newark and Asbury Park.

01:34:43.770 --> 01:34:46.299
Oh, what made me think it would work?

01:34:46.399 --> 01:34:49.307
Why should he follow me?
He doesn't love me.

01:34:49.407 --> 01:34:54.566
Oh, Connie, if only he'd show up.
I'd fall on the ground and kiss his feet...

01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:59.783
Oh, Mr Shayne.

01:34:59.883 --> 01:35:01.999
What a pleasant surprise.

01:35:02.099 --> 01:35:05.128
Erm, are you stopping at
the same motel we are?

01:35:05.228 --> 01:35:08.637
Don't press your luck. Kiss his feet!

01:35:08.737 --> 01:35:10.638
Did you drive up with anyone?

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:12.476
Yes, a plucked chicken.

01:35:12.576 --> 01:35:16.986
Oh. Maybe the four of us
can get together later for a drink.

01:35:17.086 --> 01:35:21.078
Oh, honey. You're blowing the whole thing.

01:35:21.178 --> 01:35:23.792
- Hang up the phone.
- I will not.

01:35:23.892 --> 01:35:25.923
Hang up that phone.

01:35:26.023 --> 01:35:30.514
This is no time to argue.
Get married first, then fight.

01:35:30.614 --> 01:35:31.810
Hello?

01:35:33.574 --> 01:35:35.693
My lover's waiting for me.

01:35:35.793 --> 01:35:38.739
After we're married, I'll invite him over.

01:35:38.839 --> 01:35:43.248
- We can't get married, I have problems.
- We'll work on them.

01:35:43.348 --> 01:35:46.713
I'm unstable.
What kind of mother would I make?

01:35:46.813 --> 01:35:49.473
If you fail, we can breed poodles.

01:35:49.573 --> 01:35:54.606
I also lie. And I can't stand Beasley.
It was a trap to get you to follow me.

01:35:54.706 --> 01:35:56.942
And don't forget the rashes.

01:35:57.042 --> 01:35:59.113
Put your hands in.

01:35:59.213 --> 01:36:00.213
Hey!

01:36:08.562 --> 01:36:12.065
Hey, come back!
I've already paid for the room!

01:36:23.593 --> 01:36:27.545
Did a couple just check in?
Blonde woman about this high?

01:36:27.645 --> 01:36:29.685
Yeah. Number 9.

01:36:30.691 --> 01:36:32.765
But what was I to think when...

01:36:32.865 --> 01:36:37.070
You believe I never cared for
another man till you walked into the library?

01:36:37.170 --> 01:36:39.870
- Of course!
- I won't be long.

01:36:51.567 --> 01:36:53.609
All right, where is she?

01:36:55.033 --> 01:37:00.080
You're even more repulsive than she said.
No wonder she begged me to come.

01:37:02.089 --> 01:37:04.580
It's me, Roger.

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:05.878
Hello?

01:37:06.765 --> 01:37:09.555
Mother! You were right about women.

01:37:11.274 --> 01:37:13.682
Yes, Momma. I'll wait outside.

01:37:13.782 --> 01:37:15.821
Come and get me.

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:24.957
Nothing serious, just another rash.
Quite common on honeymoons.

01:37:25.057 --> 01:37:28.383
I would recommend
an uninterrupted night's sleep.

01:37:28.483 --> 01:37:30.301
Naturally.

01:37:30.401 --> 01:37:31.597
Cathy!

01:37:32.067 --> 01:37:34.770
- Yes, darling?
- I'm so sorry.

01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:36.900
You couldn't help it.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.613
But it never happened before.

01:37:39.713 --> 01:37:42.954
You've never been in
this situation before - married.

01:37:43.054 --> 01:37:45.090
Hmm, that could be it.

01:37:46.012 --> 01:37:49.631
- I just had a horrible thought.
- What?

01:37:49.731 --> 01:37:54.269
You break out when we're not married, I do
when we are, we may never get together.

01:37:54.369 --> 01:37:59.077
If that's what you think, you don't know
the girls in Upper Sandusky.

01:38:11.356 --> 01:38:16.147
Roger, take care of the baby, will you?
I want to take a picture of Cathy.

01:38:16.247 --> 01:38:18.283
Come along, dear.

01:38:25.093 --> 01:38:26.917
Dr Gruber!

01:38:27.017 --> 01:38:28.213
Roger.

01:38:29.602 --> 01:38:31.927
- How was Vienna?
- I just got back.

01:38:32.027 --> 01:38:33.976
I've been meaning to call you.

01:38:34.076 --> 01:38:36.394
What happened with that friend of yours?

01:38:36.494 --> 01:38:38.367
The wedding was last July.

01:38:39.706 --> 01:38:42.580
- How did it work out?
- Take a look.

01:38:43.305 --> 01:38:49.210
