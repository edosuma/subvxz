WEBVTT

00:03.307 --> 00:04.526
Please don't say anything,
I don't wanna make

00:04.613 --> 00:05.570
a big deal out of it.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.485
Come on, it'll be fun.

00:07.572 --> 00:10.836
So, Peggy, your little boy's
birthday is coming up.

00:10.923 --> 00:13.013
I know when he was born,
I was front and center.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.753
Spread-eagled in stirrups

00:14.840 --> 00:17.930
screaming, "Get this
monster out of me."

00:18.018 --> 00:18.975
Didn't I tell you
not to bring it up?

00:19.062 --> 00:20.672
You did.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.544
Thank God it was in the days
before video

00:22.631 --> 00:25.851
otherwise we'd still
be watching game tapes.

00:25.938 --> 00:27.679
Well, anyway, I think
it might be fun

00:27.766 --> 00:29.203
to, to have a little party
this year.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.639
We usually go to the IHOP.

00:30.726 --> 00:31.727
He eats for free

00:31.814 --> 00:32.902
and I get the senior discount.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.296
We're in and out for six bucks.

00:35.383 --> 00:38.647
Six fifty if mom's
in a tipping mood.

00:38.734 --> 00:41.084
Hey, if I gotta hold
my coffee cup in the air

00:41.171 --> 00:43.739
like the statue of liberty
every time I need a refill

00:43.826 --> 00:46.611
Rosarita can live off the money
she skims from the till.

00:48.396 --> 00:51.007
Besides, we're not really
a party-throwing kind of family.

00:51.094 --> 00:52.835
You mean you've never
had a birthday party?

00:52.922 --> 00:54.489
I threw him one
when he turned nine

00:54.576 --> 00:56.534
and that is a nightmare,
I will not repeat.

00:56.621 --> 00:57.622
Here we go.

00:57.709 --> 00:58.667
Decorated the house

00:58.754 --> 01:00.495
invited all the neighbor kids

01:00.582 --> 01:03.280
even the poor ones with crooked
teeth and dirty necks.

01:04.847 --> 01:06.109
The Cateneso twins.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.938
Their dad drank.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.200
So, what happened?

01:10.287 --> 01:11.375
Well, the birthday boy

01:11.462 --> 01:12.594
ate three hamburgers

01:12.681 --> 01:13.986
four quarter-hunks of cake

01:14.074 --> 01:15.336
and a plastic Reagan head

01:15.423 --> 01:17.773
full of jelly belly's.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.949
I got overexcited.
It was my birthday.

01:20.036 --> 01:22.908
Barf-day is more like it.

01:22.995 --> 01:25.389
He started spraying like
a water wiggle full of urp.

01:25.476 --> 01:26.956
People were running out of here

01:27.043 --> 01:29.741
like they were
on the "Poseidon."

01:29.828 --> 01:31.395
During pin the tail
on the donkey

01:31.482 --> 01:32.918
when they blindfolded me
and spun me around

01:33.005 --> 01:34.137
it kind of all went south.

01:34.224 --> 01:37.358
It went south, north,
east and west.

01:37.445 --> 01:40.665
I've been finding whole
jelly beans for years after.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.711
It's like he didn't
even chew 'em.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.757
She gets the picture, ma.

01:45.844 --> 01:48.456
I can almost smell it.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.284
Well, it is the same couch.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.773
Who wants peach cobbler?

02:01.860 --> 02:03.775
♪ For the first time ♪

02:03.862 --> 02:07.170
♪ In my life ♪

02:07.257 --> 02:10.347
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:20.140 --> 02:21.228
[instrumental music]

02:23.621 --> 02:26.537
Here, this is the woman
I've been telling you about.

02:26.624 --> 02:29.714
- She is also from Africa.
- That picture ain't Africa.

02:29.801 --> 02:32.500
That's Lincoln park.
I recognize the hotdog vendor.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.982
Gary. Or Jerry?

02:37.069 --> 02:39.246
She's a beautiful woman, if that
is indeed her real picture.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.769
What are you talking about?

02:40.856 --> 02:42.379
'People lie all the time
on these dating sites.'

02:42.466 --> 02:44.686
I once tried hooking up
with this hot Filipino chick

02:44.773 --> 02:46.949
ended up being a short
Guatemalan man named Roberto.

02:48.690 --> 02:51.214
- Oh, yeah, he was a nice guy.
- Mm.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.261
Real sweetheart,
bought dinner that night

02:54.348 --> 02:55.958
and taught me
how to salsa-dance.

02:57.438 --> 03:00.049
Well, Amira
is who she says she is.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.007
We have e-mailed
on several occasions

03:02.094 --> 03:04.314
and tonight,
we're meeting face-to-face.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.186
I hope it works out
for you, pal.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.883
Me, too, most
of my success stories

03:07.970 --> 03:09.363
came on the international
love sites.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.887
Your Russian,
Czechoslovakian, Ukrainian.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.976
When they don't speak English,
it gives him a two-week head

03:14.063 --> 03:16.718
start before they realize he's
full of crap in any language.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.983
Two weeks is more than enough
time to do what I need to do

03:21.070 --> 03:22.376
and a couple of things
I thought I wanted to do

03:22.463 --> 03:23.681
but once I did them,
I wish I hadn't.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.685
I'm actually hoping
for something more substantial

03:27.772 --> 03:29.209
and long-term.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.385
A soul mate who appreciates me
for who I am.

03:31.472 --> 03:32.908
And I hope
that's on your profile page

03:32.995 --> 03:34.170
'cause that's the kind
of crap-ski

03:34.257 --> 03:36.128
that can get a comrade laid-ski.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.392
Never mind him, Samuel.

03:38.479 --> 03:39.697
I'm glad you're being honest

03:39.784 --> 03:41.264
and starting things off
on the right foot.

03:41.351 --> 03:42.787
Thank you, Mike.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.441
Oh, by the way, may I borrow
your car tonight?

03:44.528 --> 03:45.660
What do you need my car for?

03:45.747 --> 03:48.576
I told her I had a car.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.926
It seemed slightly
more impressive than telling her

03:51.013 --> 03:53.755
I had four days left
on my bus pass.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.670
That's good, but try to keep
the lies to a minimum

03:55.757 --> 03:57.106
otherwise, after two weeks,
you're gonna have

03:57.193 --> 03:58.673
some angry Ukrainian bitch
demanding to see

03:58.760 --> 04:00.457
the rocks you collected
on your moon walk.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.461
His mom hasn't thrown him
a birthday party

04:04.548 --> 04:05.723
since he was nine?

04:05.810 --> 04:08.160
- That's so sad.
- Well, you've met her.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.816
She's a...hideous woman.

04:11.903 --> 04:14.210
Guess that explains why he's 35,
never been married

04:14.297 --> 04:15.994
and puts his belt on
with a boomerang.

04:18.214 --> 04:19.476
So, his weight issues
are because

04:19.563 --> 04:20.956
of his relationship
with his mother?

04:21.043 --> 04:22.262
What does that say
about you and me?

04:22.349 --> 04:23.306
You're big-boned

04:23.393 --> 04:26.309
and have a hearty appetite.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.659
Now pipe down
and get mama some more wine.

04:30.095 --> 04:32.881
Okay, mama.

04:32.968 --> 04:35.623
So, are you gonna go ahead
and throw him a party?

04:35.710 --> 04:38.321
I'm thinking about it.
Maybe a surprise party.

04:38.408 --> 04:41.106
Just have to get
typhoid Peggy on board.

04:41.193 --> 04:42.456
I say we do it.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.980
Yeah, let's give
that poor, sweet man

04:45.067 --> 04:47.069
the love and attention he never

04:47.156 --> 04:49.027
got as a fat little boy.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.770
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

04:52.857 --> 04:53.945
Speak of the devil.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.860
We were just talking about you.

04:55.947 --> 04:59.124
- 'Oh, really? What about?'
- Nothing.

04:59.211 --> 05:02.040
We're just glad
you're living here with us.

05:02.127 --> 05:04.391
And that you're a part
of our family.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.568
- Thanks. Appreciate it.
- No.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.657
We appreciate you.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.050
Just the way you are.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.838
What's up with this?

05:16.925 --> 05:19.275
They're drunk
and they like you.

05:21.973 --> 05:25.194
Oh, okay, well,
I like you, too.

05:25.281 --> 05:27.239
I'll get that,
you gals stay here

05:27.327 --> 05:30.068
and maybe think about getting
a little food in your stomach.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.118
Alright, if we are gonna
throw him a surprise party

05:36.205 --> 05:38.468
we are off to a very poor start.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.432
Sorry, pal, I'm not donating
to the Nation of Islam.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.652
I'm sorry I don't meet
your fashion standards

05:48.739 --> 05:51.220
Mr. Blackwell.

05:51.307 --> 05:52.569
I'm just kidding.
You look swell.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.049
This girl's gonna
be very impressed

05:54.136 --> 05:55.355
especially when you roll up

05:55.442 --> 05:56.878
in a freshly armor alled

05:56.965 --> 05:58.270
Mitsubishi Galant.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.709
I really appreciate
the use of your car.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.885
Wow, somebody's either
got a date

06:03.972 --> 06:05.974
or he's collecting money
for the Nation of Islam.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.196
Okay, I'm losing the tie.

06:11.283 --> 06:12.241
He met a nice girl online.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.460
I'm letting him borrow my car.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.765
Oh, that's great.

06:14.852 --> 06:15.984
Did you tell him
about the brakes?

06:16.071 --> 06:17.507
I was getting to that.

06:17.594 --> 06:19.204
Uh, just a couple of things
you need to know

06:19.291 --> 06:20.292
about sweet lady Galant.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.903
She can be a bitch.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.123
- I got this.
- Okay.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.864
She can be a bitch.

06:26.951 --> 06:27.996
You gotta start
pumping the brakes

06:28.083 --> 06:29.084
about a half a block

06:29.171 --> 06:30.520
before you get to a stop sign.

06:30.607 --> 06:31.913
Yeah, and if you think
you're gonna stop short

06:32.000 --> 06:33.393
keep your hand
on the emergency brake

06:33.480 --> 06:35.438
and be prepared
to yank that sucker

06:35.525 --> 06:37.701
like your life depends on it,
'cause it does.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.575
Other than that, have fun.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.315
Okay, uh, thanks.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.708
I'll have it back
to you tomorrow morning.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.841
Not if you park
on a hill, you won't.

06:51.933 --> 06:54.239
So, what are you doing
for your birthday this year?

06:54.326 --> 06:56.633
I guess it's just me
and mom at the IHOP.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.418
You're welcome to join us
if you want.

06:58.505 --> 06:59.854
Watching you wolf down
a Belgian waffle

06:59.941 --> 07:01.856
with strawberry compote
while your mom describes

07:01.943 --> 07:04.249
what a blood bath
your birth was?

07:04.336 --> 07:06.817
No, thank you.

07:06.904 --> 07:10.342
Good morning, my brothers
from another mother.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.823
What a glorious day it is.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.391
Wow. Sounds like somebody's date
went pretty well, huh?

07:15.478 --> 07:17.741
Amira was more beautiful
than her pictures.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.221
It-it was a perfect evening.

07:19.308 --> 07:22.920
Hey, you didn't do it
in my car, did you?

07:23.007 --> 07:25.053
Well, as much as I wanted
to consummate our attraction

07:25.140 --> 07:27.490
on a vinyl car seat covered
in Arby's wrappers..

07:29.318 --> 07:31.407
...I chose to wait
until we had a proper courtship.

07:32.713 --> 07:35.324
Plus, she wouldn't let me.

07:35.411 --> 07:36.456
So, where'd you take her?

07:36.543 --> 07:37.587
We had a five-course dinner

07:37.674 --> 07:38.632
at the Florentine

07:38.719 --> 07:40.285
and split a bottle of champagne.

07:40.372 --> 07:41.461
And she still
wouldn't give it up?

07:43.332 --> 07:45.508
Every one of them online
Svetlanas was good to go

07:45.595 --> 07:48.032
after a roach coach taco
and a can of Foster's lager.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.777
Look, I-I don't
wanna pry, Samuel

07:53.864 --> 07:55.649
but that sounds like
a pretty expensive evening

07:55.736 --> 07:58.521
for a man of, shall we say,
meager means.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.567
Uh, what Mike is wondering is
how a broke ass-schmuck like you

08:00.654 --> 08:01.742
is paying for all this crap?

08:03.657 --> 08:06.573
I gleaned that on my own, Carl.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.139
Last night's magic was courtesy

08:08.226 --> 08:11.316
of my now maxed-out
discover card.

08:11.403 --> 08:13.188
And how long do you plan
on maintaining

08:13.275 --> 08:16.104
this level of costly,
sexless courtship?

08:16.191 --> 08:18.454
Well, I was hoping you gentlemen
would either loan me the money

08:18.541 --> 08:20.412
or leave me a 700 percent tip.

08:22.284 --> 08:23.851
Hey, look, I already
let you borrow my car

08:23.938 --> 08:25.548
which you still
haven't returned, by the way.

08:25.635 --> 08:26.854
That's right.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.899
- Here are the keys.
- Thank you.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.336
Amira was very impressed
with your car.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.600
The valet at the restaurant,
eh, not so much.

08:36.820 --> 08:37.908
Hello, Samuel.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.519
Oh, my goodness,
there she is.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.868
I have missed you so much.

08:40.955 --> 08:42.522
I missed you, too.

08:44.436 --> 08:47.004
Wow, I got to get back to Africa
and embrace my roots.

08:50.268 --> 08:51.574
Me too.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.275
Amira, these are my friends,
Mike and Carl.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.581
Gentlemen, this is Amira.

08:58.668 --> 08:59.626
- Hi.
- Hi, Amira.

08:59.713 --> 09:00.975
Nice to meet you.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.630
Samuel has spoken
so highly of both of you.

09:03.717 --> 09:07.459
But he did not mention how
handsome and masculine you are.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.027
Guys don't talk that way
about other guys.

09:10.114 --> 09:13.770
- Even if it is true.
- Especially when it's true.

09:13.857 --> 09:16.120
So to what do I owe
this wonderful surprise?

09:16.207 --> 09:19.036
I was just hoping that after
you closed up your restaurant

09:19.123 --> 09:21.648
we could go for a drive
in your Mitsubishi Cadillac.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.653
I would love that.

09:29.003 --> 09:33.747
Oh, right. Thanks for loaning me
your Cadillac.

09:33.834 --> 09:37.141
Did you remember
to put gas back in it?

09:37.228 --> 09:38.186
Sadly, no.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.538
Here's 20 to cover it.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.235
It's a big tank.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.591
Glad I didn't borrow
Samuel's car.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.905
And believe it or not,
I got Mike's mom to agree

10:01.992 --> 10:03.080
to a party at her place.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.821
Wow, how'd you do that?

10:04.908 --> 10:06.910
I agreed to clean up
his cake vomit.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.045
That's fair.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.221
And when he comes
to pick her up to go to IHOP--

10:13.308 --> 10:15.092
- Surprise!
- Shh.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.575
Surprise.

10:19.662 --> 10:22.056
So, what do we do when
he comes down for breakfast?

10:22.143 --> 10:23.840
Pretend we forgot
it's his birthday?

10:23.927 --> 10:26.016
No. No, no, classic mistake.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.888
Acknowledge it the way
you normally would

10:27.975 --> 10:30.368
but don't go overboard.
It'll make him suspicious.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.457
Kind of like when you get
pulled over by the cops

10:32.544 --> 10:34.459
when you're high on weed.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.682
You wanna act straight..

10:39.769 --> 10:41.162
...but not too straight.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.818
I never thought
I would say this

10:44.905 --> 10:47.168
but you-you are
absolutely right.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.259
- Morning, ladies.
- Hey, sweetie.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.217
Happy Birthday.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.958
That's right, it is my birthday.

10:55.045 --> 10:57.352
Congratulations, officer.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.963
And I realize
you're just doing your job.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.492
Well, I'm not treating
you different today

11:07.579 --> 11:08.711
than I do any other day.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.105
Okey-dokey, senorchunko?

11:13.107 --> 11:16.240
Mom, Victoria,
quit being so weird.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.589
They're-they're so weird.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.461
You'd better get out of here.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.332
And get away, g-get out of here.

11:21.419 --> 11:23.987
Get away from these weirdos.

11:24.074 --> 11:26.076
Happy Birthday!

11:26.163 --> 11:28.644
Lucky for you two,
he is a very simple man.

11:33.605 --> 11:36.304
Something's up. Those women
are acting freakier than usual.

11:36.391 --> 11:39.220
I think it's got something
to do with my birthday.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.830
Is today your birthday?

11:40.917 --> 11:42.440
Oh, how did that sneak up on me?

11:42.527 --> 11:44.399
- Happy Birthday.
- Thanks.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.531
Hey, after work, what do you say
you and I go grab

11:46.618 --> 11:48.142
a couple of beers,
maybe shoot a game of pool?

11:48.229 --> 11:49.447
No, you can't,
you got to be at your mom's

11:49.534 --> 11:51.145
between 6:00 and 6:15.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.976
To take her to the IHOP.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.065
For your birthday.

11:58.152 --> 12:00.807
Which I forgot about.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.331
Molly's throwing me
a surprise party, isn't she?

12:03.418 --> 12:04.724
And she's going through a lot
of trouble, too

12:04.811 --> 12:06.029
so when you walk in that door

12:06.116 --> 12:07.596
you better act
good and surprised!

12:07.683 --> 12:08.902
Ah, this is great,
I can't believe

12:08.989 --> 12:10.773
I'm getting a surprise party!

12:10.860 --> 12:14.342
I hope you're gonna do better
than that, 'cause that terrible.

12:14.429 --> 12:15.865
What are you talking about?
That was real.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.649
Well, your real
is totally unbelievable.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.347
I mean, we need you to appear
excited, but don't act like

12:19.434 --> 12:22.829
they just called your name
on the "Price is Right."

12:22.916 --> 12:25.092
Carl, don't worry about it.
I can handle this.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.050
It's like when somebody
sets you up with a sure thing.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.573
I mean, you know eventually
her clothes are gonna come off

12:28.660 --> 12:30.097
but when they do,
you got to act like

12:30.184 --> 12:32.360
"Oh, my goodness,
what an unexpected treat."

12:32.447 --> 12:34.579
Otherwise, that poor girl's
just gonna feel like a whore.

12:36.668 --> 12:39.193
I get it. Surprised,
but not too surprised.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.934
And, look, tonight I need
you to keep an eye on me.

12:41.021 --> 12:43.197
Don't let me eat too much
or get overexcited.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.546
So my whole night's
gonna be spent

12:44.633 --> 12:46.156
keeping cake out of that mouth?

12:46.243 --> 12:47.201
Do I get to wear falcon gloves

12:47.288 --> 12:50.030
and carry a tennis racket?

12:50.117 --> 12:52.597
I'm just asking you as
a friend, to keep an eye on me.

12:52.684 --> 12:55.078
Fine! I will limit
you to one piece of nana's cake.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.645
And she's been working
on it all morning

12:56.732 --> 12:58.429
so try and act surprised,
but not too surprised!

12:58.516 --> 12:59.561
Nana's making a cake?

12:59.648 --> 13:00.997
Oh, man, this is the best

13:01.084 --> 13:02.390
birthday ever!

13:02.477 --> 13:05.132
See, that right there
is too much.

13:05.219 --> 13:06.220
If I'd acted that way
with the sure thing

13:06.307 --> 13:07.612
she would've put her top back on

13:07.699 --> 13:09.789
and kicked me
out of that toll booth.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.011
I'll take care of the streamers,
you and mom start

13:15.098 --> 13:16.056
blowing up balloons.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.405
Got it.

13:17.492 --> 13:18.710
Maybe dust a little.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.234
Take a rag to these windows.

13:20.321 --> 13:23.585
Sure. Right after
we delouse the carpet.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.326
Oh, I'm sorry, is my mud hut

13:25.413 --> 13:27.807
not fancy enough
for your snazzy to-do?

13:29.504 --> 13:32.246
No, we just thought we could
spruce things up a little.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.814
Well, if you're feeling
in a Mary Poppins kind of mood

13:34.901 --> 13:38.818
the upstairs crapper is sporting
four shades of ugly.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.210
We'll just hang more balloons

13:40.297 --> 13:42.778
and try to keep
the guests downstairs.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.086
Here we go! Alright!

13:46.173 --> 13:48.523
Old lady coming through!

13:48.610 --> 13:50.960
Okay, nana, we're here.
Watch that carpet.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.049
You don't wanna fall down
and break a hip.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.791
Tell this fool
to quit yelling at me

13:55.878 --> 13:58.272
before I slap the Grecian
formula out of his hair.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.319
Spry old chicken, isn't she?

14:02.406 --> 14:04.713
You wanna sit down,
nana, take a load off?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.410
If I'm as feeble
as you think I am

14:06.497 --> 14:08.760
then why ain't
you carrying my damn cake?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.414
I got a bad back,
and I didn't want you

14:10.501 --> 14:13.200
to feel completely useless.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.202
Hey, nana, let me take that.

14:15.289 --> 14:16.768
You didn't park in front
of the house, did you?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.770
I parked down the street
like you told me.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.948
Made me lug my cake a block
and a half, the whole time

14:22.035 --> 14:25.647
trying to talk me
into buying a racehorse.

14:25.734 --> 14:28.563
I was offering you an investment
opportunity that'll take care

14:28.650 --> 14:32.045
of you in your dotage, which
let's be honest, is almost over.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.788
I'm gonna kill this man.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.226
Well, wait till after the party
and we'll all help.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.794
Fourteen hundred dollars?

14:42.882 --> 14:45.362
The woman at the store said
that if I bought this dress

14:45.449 --> 14:47.887
that I had to buy the shoes
and I had to buy the earrings.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.889
Fourteen hundred dollars?

14:51.934 --> 14:53.153
That's okay, right?

14:53.240 --> 14:54.806
Well, of course.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.548
I'm a successful restauranteur,
not some poor waiter

14:57.635 --> 14:59.899
who has to sell his blood
and semen just to pay for it.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.511
Samuel, I'm late for the party.
Give me the keys.

15:03.598 --> 15:06.427
You mean the keys
to the Cadillac?

15:06.514 --> 15:09.125
Yes.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.431
Funny story, Mike.

15:10.518 --> 15:11.998
Amira was late for her pedicure

15:12.085 --> 15:13.434
and needed to borrow my car.

15:13.521 --> 15:14.565
And what's the punch line?

15:14.652 --> 15:16.654
Towed, wrecked or stolen?

15:16.741 --> 15:17.917
Misplaced.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.050
But look at her.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.878
Can't expect her
to be smart, too.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.709
May I borrow $1,400?

15:31.756 --> 15:33.715
Ooh, car, car, car!

15:33.802 --> 15:35.630
Everybody hide!

15:37.675 --> 15:38.981
Oh, nope.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.591
Nice car. False alarm.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.376
[all]
Oh.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.336
Man, it's-it's been an hour
since I dropped him off

15:46.423 --> 15:47.555
and he knows we're all
waiting here for him.

15:47.642 --> 15:50.340
Carl!

15:50.427 --> 15:52.386
- I'm sorry, he knows what?
- What?

15:53.778 --> 15:55.519
- Carl!
- Hang on, now.

15:55.606 --> 15:56.956
You guys were the ones
acting weird

15:57.043 --> 15:58.218
making him all suspicious.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.306
All I did was just

15:59.393 --> 16:00.524
confirm those suspicions.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.093
Mike didn't
wanna hurt your feelings

16:04.180 --> 16:06.008
by letting on that he knew.

16:06.095 --> 16:09.142
Really? That's sweet.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.318
And Mike told Carl
not to tell you

16:11.405 --> 16:13.407
so I guess that's two secrets
that you've blown today.

16:13.494 --> 16:15.322
Way to go, double-o stupid.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.544
Oh, this might be him.

16:24.113 --> 16:26.072
He already knows!

16:26.159 --> 16:27.812
What's wrong with you people?

16:38.475 --> 16:40.347
Knock it off!

16:40.434 --> 16:43.306
It's a city bus,
not the tunnel of love!

16:43.393 --> 16:46.135
Sorry.
Hey, excuse me.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.832
I will enjoy the new Nano
you bought me.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.051
Mm-hmm.

16:50.183 --> 16:51.445
What?

16:51.532 --> 16:53.099
My party started
over an hour ago.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.014
And every time this bus
makes another stop

16:55.101 --> 16:58.060
I hate you a little more.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.670
I know, Mike, but look at her.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.324
Isn't she adorable?

17:01.411 --> 17:02.630
Yes, she is,
but how long do you think

17:02.717 --> 17:04.066
you can keep up this ruse?

17:04.153 --> 17:05.763
Eighteen days.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.156
That's only if I can get
somebody to buy

17:07.243 --> 17:09.245
one of my kidneys.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.508
I'll ask around.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.597
But until then, you need
to come clean with this girl

17:13.684 --> 17:15.382
and tell her
the truth about yourself.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.427
What, that I'm a penniless
waiter who shares an apartment

17:17.514 --> 17:18.472
with three other
penniless waiters

17:18.559 --> 17:20.213
and two penniless cabbies?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.867
We're on a cross-town bus
and you live with a cabbie?

17:26.393 --> 17:28.830
Look, I'm just saying, if this
woman doesn't care about you

17:28.917 --> 17:31.180
for who you really are,
then she's not the right one.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.877
But I don't
want to lose her, Mike.

17:32.964 --> 17:34.836
If she doesn't know who you are,
you don't really

17:34.923 --> 17:36.142
have her in the first place.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.274
I just get so lonely.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.842
Look, when you met Molly,
it filled me with hope.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.713
But when Carl got a girlfriend

17:42.800 --> 17:44.541
I wanted to hang myself.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.458
Well, with me
and Molly, it was destiny.

17:48.545 --> 17:51.287
In Carl's case,
just pure, dumb luck.

17:51.374 --> 17:54.290
Like a chicken predicting
the Super Bowl point spread.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.427
So you think if I tell Amira
the truth about myself

18:00.514 --> 18:02.211
I could have what you have?

18:02.298 --> 18:03.995
Sure hope so.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.214
I mean, look at me.

18:05.301 --> 18:06.955
I don't know where my car is.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.478
I'm riding on this stinky bus

18:08.565 --> 18:11.002
an hour late for my own party

18:11.090 --> 18:13.962
but because I know Molly's
sitting there waiting for me

18:14.049 --> 18:16.965
it's still the best birthday
of my life.

18:17.052 --> 18:18.488
That's beautiful.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.404
I'm gonna tell Amira
the truth right now.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.493
Hey, can you wait
until after my party?

18:23.580 --> 18:26.757
'Cause I only get one,
like, every 25 years.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.933
Of course.
Happy Birthday.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.631
Are we done here?

18:30.718 --> 18:32.285
Yeah, we're done.

18:42.686 --> 18:43.774
Sorry I'm late, mom.

18:43.861 --> 18:46.386
Molly, what are you doing here?

18:46.473 --> 18:48.866
And what are all
these decorations?

18:50.520 --> 18:52.043
- Don't bother.
- What do you mean?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.654
The jig is up.

18:53.741 --> 18:56.352
We waited two hours, and
everybody left and went to IHOP.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.789
Which is where we should have
gone in the first place.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.922
Let it go, old woman!

19:03.620 --> 19:06.580
It's always your way or
the highway, isn't it, duchess?

19:06.667 --> 19:08.277
- Get off my back!
- Stop fighting.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.626
It's my birthday!

19:09.713 --> 19:11.411
[all]
Surprise!

19:13.456 --> 19:14.805
So I do get a party?

19:14.892 --> 19:18.026
We are having a party?
This is it, right?

19:18.113 --> 19:20.507
- We got him!
- Got him good!

19:23.336 --> 19:24.598
Ah.

19:24.685 --> 19:27.383
Make a wish.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.777
I don't need to.

19:29.864 --> 19:31.561
I already got
everything I want.
