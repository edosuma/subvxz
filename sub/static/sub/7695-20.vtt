WEBVTT

00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
â™ªâ™ª

00:08.809 --> 00:11.782
I am so happy
Mr. Davenport gave
everyone the day off,

00:11.782 --> 00:13.784
because it's way too hot
to train.

00:13.784 --> 00:15.216
Yeah, well, lucky for you,

00:15.216 --> 00:17.818
your brother's a bionic
air conditioner.

00:17.818 --> 00:21.722
Adam, nobody wants
your disgusting breath
blowing all over--

00:21.722 --> 00:23.624
Oh, good heavens,
that is so much better!

00:23.624 --> 00:25.996
Get my back.
Get my back.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.461
Hey, guys.

00:30.461 --> 00:32.503
( all saying hello )

00:33.634 --> 00:35.206
Hi.

00:35.206 --> 00:38.038
Mom, what are you doing here
in the middle of the week?

00:38.038 --> 00:40.611
Did you finally give up
that two-bit job as
a local news reporter?

00:42.613 --> 00:47.518
Ahem! Everybody, I have
a very important announcement.

00:47.518 --> 00:49.620
I...

00:49.620 --> 00:51.682
Donald Davenport...

00:51.682 --> 00:54.285
am the first person
to create a livable environment

00:54.285 --> 00:55.826
on another planet.

00:55.826 --> 00:57.228
What?

00:57.228 --> 00:59.390
Behold...

00:59.390 --> 01:02.463
my very own
space colony.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.535
( all exclaiming )

01:04.535 --> 01:07.738
You've colonized a planet?
Why didn't you tell me?

01:07.738 --> 01:09.870
Because it was
top secret,

01:09.870 --> 01:11.772
and because every time
I tell you guys anything,

01:11.772 --> 01:13.544
then you blow it up,
burn it down,

01:13.544 --> 01:15.045
crack it in half
or sink it.

01:15.045 --> 01:17.948
Hey, that is not...

01:17.948 --> 01:20.751
- Yeah, it is true.
- Mm-hmm.

01:20.751 --> 01:23.184
Looks cool.
Is that Mars?

01:23.184 --> 01:24.955
( scoffs )
Please. Mars?

01:24.955 --> 01:27.188
Mars is for amateurs.

01:27.188 --> 01:30.521
I colonized a planet
in an entirely different galaxy.

01:30.521 --> 01:32.363
Oh, by the way,
did I mention

01:32.363 --> 01:35.966
I discovered an entirely
different galaxy?

01:35.966 --> 01:39.470
How dare you?

01:39.470 --> 01:42.533
The planet
is called Lithios,

01:42.533 --> 01:44.875
and this high-tech dome
mimics the Earth's environment,

01:44.875 --> 01:47.378
providing oxygen
and gravity to the 50 colonists

01:47.378 --> 01:49.680
that I hand-picked
for the project.

01:49.680 --> 01:52.843
I'm also the honorary
mayor of the colony,

01:52.843 --> 01:56.847
which I have named
Davenportia.

01:58.789 --> 02:01.121
Shocking.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.524
Those colonists have been
living there for almost a month,

02:03.524 --> 02:06.957
and they are lovin'
every Daven minute of it.

02:06.957 --> 02:10.360
And pretty soon, you will
all get to meet them.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.333
That's right.
We are going

02:12.333 --> 02:15.936
on a family vacation
to space!

02:16.967 --> 02:19.610
You told me
we were going to Greece.

02:19.610 --> 02:24.144
Well, Davenportia
is the Greece of space.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.578
Anyway, so it'll be
a lot cooler there.

02:27.578 --> 02:29.079
It is way too hot
here today.

02:29.079 --> 02:31.081
No worries.
I got you covered.

02:32.423 --> 02:33.754
( yells )

02:35.426 --> 02:37.588
That's gonna leave
a Daven stain.

02:39.630 --> 02:42.263
The world's first
 bionic superhumans.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.934
They're stronger than us.

02:43.934 --> 02:46.036
Faster.
 Smarter.

02:46.036 --> 02:49.169
The next generation
 of the human race is...

02:49.169 --> 02:51.171
living on a bionic island.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.482
This is it.

03:31.482 --> 03:33.914
Welcome to my intergalactic
spacecraft;

03:33.914 --> 03:35.486
my pride and joy.

03:35.486 --> 03:37.147
Isn't she beautiful?

03:37.147 --> 03:41.892
Wow! I never thought I'd be
jealous of a spaceship.

03:41.892 --> 03:44.325
Oh, come on, honey,
don't be jealous.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.027
You don't stand a chance
against this thing.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.830
I can't believe
this spaceship's
been under the island

03:49.830 --> 03:52.202
all this time.

03:52.202 --> 03:56.407
That explains why
he didn't make us
live in the basement.

03:56.407 --> 03:59.039
Mr. Davenport,
this is awesome.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.772
If I was a nerd,
I'd totally be
geeking out right now.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.615
( goofy excited laughter )

04:05.946 --> 04:11.051
Cool. What's that?

04:11.051 --> 04:14.054
Oh, that's my high-velocity
escape suit.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.956
It's made out of
ultra-protective material

04:15.956 --> 04:17.558
that will allow me
to fly back to Earth

04:17.558 --> 04:18.559
in case we encounter
any kind of emergency.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.160
while in space.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.992
But there's only
one suit.

04:21.992 --> 04:24.164
What about
the rest of us?

04:24.164 --> 04:26.797
The rest of you
better hope there's
no emergencies.

04:28.399 --> 04:30.901
( deep voice )
I am Zolton,

04:30.901 --> 04:32.943
leader of the planet
Darkom.

04:32.943 --> 04:36.246
Bow to me,
puny inferior being.

04:36.246 --> 04:37.478
Adam...

04:37.478 --> 04:39.310
Who is this Adam
you speak of?

04:39.310 --> 04:41.211
- I am Zolton!
- Adam!

04:41.211 --> 04:43.384
- Zolton!
- Give me that helmet.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.487
No, I will not.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.720
Zolton does not understand
the human language.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.992
Oh, but he speaks it?

04:54.264 --> 04:57.067
Zolton will get back to you
when he has an answer for that.

04:58.268 --> 05:00.831
Okay, people,
listen up.

05:00.831 --> 05:03.133
As your mission leader,
it's my responsibility

05:03.133 --> 05:05.205
to inform you
of what to do

05:05.205 --> 05:06.877
in case of an emergency.

05:06.877 --> 05:08.709
Since we'll be traveling
at speeds greater than

05:08.709 --> 05:11.181
186,000 miles per second--

05:11.181 --> 05:14.014
Blah blah blah.
I got this. Ahem.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.786
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:15.786 --> 05:17.287
there are two exits
on the aircraft--

05:17.287 --> 05:19.119
one in the front
and in the rear.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.451
In the event of
a water landing,

05:20.451 --> 05:23.293
Chase can be used
as a flotation device.

05:25.996 --> 05:28.559
Okay, Bree, Leo,
Tasha, Mr. Davenport,

05:28.559 --> 05:30.461
you're all up front with me.

05:30.461 --> 05:32.803
Adam, you're
in the back.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.467
What? Why am I
in the back?

05:36.467 --> 05:38.469
Because you are
so immature,

05:38.469 --> 05:41.642
you can't even pay attention
to my safety directives.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.044
And I don't feel like
traveling across two galaxies

05:44.044 --> 05:47.618
hearing, "Ooh, what does
this button do?" 800 times!

05:48.849 --> 05:50.881
I'm not immature.

05:50.881 --> 05:53.454
And for your information, I know
what all these buttons do.

05:53.454 --> 05:56.627
Like this one right here
works the windshield wipers.

05:56.627 --> 05:58.128
Adam, no!

06:02.062 --> 06:05.696
ADAM: Chase, what do we do
in an emergency again?

06:14.204 --> 06:16.877
Wow. Look at the moon.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.179
Are we there yet?

06:19.179 --> 06:21.452
No.

06:24.915 --> 06:27.718
Wow, look at Saturn.

06:27.718 --> 06:30.360
Are we there yet?!

06:30.360 --> 06:32.893
No!

06:34.064 --> 06:36.527
ADAM: Are we
there yet?

06:36.527 --> 06:39.530
Adam, if you ask
"Are we there yet?"

06:39.530 --> 06:42.032
one more time, I swear,
I'm gonna lose it.

06:42.032 --> 06:44.034
Okay, sorry.

06:45.876 --> 06:47.938
How much longer
till we get there?

06:50.380 --> 06:53.514
Relax. Everybody,
relax!

06:53.514 --> 06:56.286
Now that we've left
the solar system,

06:56.286 --> 06:59.089
we can initiate
hyper-speed.

06:59.089 --> 07:00.791
What's hyper-speed?

07:00.791 --> 07:02.192
This.

07:30.521 --> 07:33.183
Welcome to
Davenportia.

07:33.183 --> 07:35.255
Isn't it beautiful?

07:35.255 --> 07:38.088
Ah, who needs Greece
when you can come here?

07:40.130 --> 07:41.692
It's lovely.

07:41.692 --> 07:43.594
But if you really
wanna make it up to me,

07:43.594 --> 07:46.937
you should rename it
Tashadonia.

07:46.937 --> 07:49.299
Oh, honey, you know
I love me

07:49.299 --> 07:51.001
more than I love you.

07:52.603 --> 07:55.075
Hey, what's this big
bubble for?

07:55.075 --> 07:57.948
It's not a bubble.
It's a dome.

07:57.948 --> 08:00.350
Don't care.
Still wanna pop it.

08:00.350 --> 08:01.982
Well, you can't.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.253
It protects everything
in here

08:03.253 --> 08:05.355
from the planet's
natural elements.

08:05.355 --> 08:07.558
Without that dome,
there'd be no oxygen,

08:07.558 --> 08:08.859
and all the colonists
would die.

08:08.859 --> 08:11.662
Donald, that
sounds dangerous.

08:11.662 --> 08:13.994
It is. That's why I didn't
tell these guinea pigs

08:13.994 --> 08:16.196
until after they signed
their paperwork.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.929
Hi. How you doing?

08:21.031 --> 08:22.232
I don't care
if you're not the waiter.

08:22.232 --> 08:24.334
I want more
space pancakes.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.408
Perry?! What are you
doing up here?

08:28.408 --> 08:31.642
Wherever the bus stops,
I get off.

08:31.642 --> 08:34.244
Forget that.
How did you get here?

08:34.244 --> 08:36.917
I snuck up here weeks ago
with the rest of these bozos.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.418
I can blend in anywhere.

08:38.418 --> 08:39.919
I spent three months

08:39.919 --> 08:41.652
on the South Korean
gymnastics team.

08:43.493 --> 08:47.497
How dare you
sneak up here uninvited?

08:47.497 --> 08:52.002
That's Tasha, the one
I was telling you about.

08:52.002 --> 08:54.364
That's a new low.

08:54.364 --> 08:57.207
Never been bad-mouthed
on another planet before.

08:57.207 --> 08:58.669
Oh, I doubt
that's true.

09:03.443 --> 09:06.116
This command center
is the electronic nervous system

09:06.116 --> 09:07.818
of Davenportia.

09:07.818 --> 09:10.480
From this chair,
I can monitor all the activity

09:10.480 --> 09:11.822
in the colony.

09:11.822 --> 09:13.784
Man, you old people
will do anything

09:13.784 --> 09:15.986
to just sit around
and watch TV all day.

09:17.387 --> 09:19.489
Love the colony,
Mr. Davenport.

09:19.489 --> 09:22.232
Thanks.
This is just the beginning.

09:22.232 --> 09:25.565
Pretty soon, there
will be Davenportias
throughout the universe.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.638
I don't know
if aliens exist,

09:27.638 --> 09:29.900
but if they do,
they are gonna hate you.

09:32.572 --> 09:36.406
I have a very important
scientific question.

09:36.406 --> 09:39.449
While we're here, is it okay
if I eat stuff off the ground?

09:39.449 --> 09:41.311
No.

09:41.311 --> 09:43.483
Okay. Follow-up question.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.916
How do I regurgitate stuff
I've eaten off the ground?

09:47.417 --> 09:49.720
You see? This is what
I'm talking about.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.422
Mature people don't eat stuff
off the ground.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.265
Big D., you better
get over here.

09:55.265 --> 09:57.227
I think we have a problem.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.731
Oh, no.

10:00.731 --> 10:02.903
The main communication
satellite is down.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.404
What happened?

10:04.404 --> 10:06.436
I don't know.
Something must've hit it.

10:06.436 --> 10:08.408
Asteroid, space debris.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.580
Now we have no way
of communicating with the Earth.

10:12.082 --> 10:13.714
I need you three
to take the spacecraft out

10:13.714 --> 10:15.315
and repair the satellite.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.117
Leo and I will stay here
and re-establish contact

10:17.117 --> 10:18.388
- once it's up and running.
- Let's go.

10:22.492 --> 10:26.326
Adam, he just told you not to
eat stuff off the floor up here.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.258
Relax.

10:28.258 --> 10:30.731
I got this
off the floor at home.

10:33.303 --> 10:35.435
They should almost be
at the satellite.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.807
As soon as they fix
the problem,

10:36.807 --> 10:38.438
communications
will be restored,

10:38.438 --> 10:40.240
and everything will be
back to normal.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.714
Right, if normal is living
a trillion miles from home

10:43.714 --> 10:45.645
in an ego-maniac's
space bubble.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.218
( alarm blaring )

10:48.218 --> 10:50.280
What's that?

10:50.280 --> 10:51.782
That's the dome's
emergency system.

10:51.782 --> 10:53.223
Something must have
punctured it.

10:53.223 --> 10:54.885
Ah! Look!

10:59.059 --> 11:01.461
Wow, Big D., first
your satellite's down,

11:01.461 --> 11:03.633
then there's
a hole in the dome.

11:03.633 --> 11:06.166
I'm sorry, but your colony's
only getting two stars

11:06.166 --> 11:08.498
in my online review.

11:08.498 --> 11:10.300
If we don't
patch that hole,

11:10.300 --> 11:12.002
all the oxygen
in the colony
will be sucked out

11:12.002 --> 11:14.544
in a matter of hours,
and we'll both be dead!

11:14.544 --> 11:16.276
Excuse me?!

11:16.276 --> 11:18.148
Stop talking, Tasha.

11:18.148 --> 11:20.010
You're sucking up
all the oxygen!

11:25.455 --> 11:28.118
All right, we're
at the satellite.

11:28.118 --> 11:29.559
Adam, help me put on
my jet pack.

11:29.559 --> 11:31.892
Sure, but first,
there's something

11:31.892 --> 11:33.393
I've always wanted to try.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.565
Blowin' a bubble
in zero gravity.

11:43.473 --> 11:45.335
Whoa! Awesome!

11:45.335 --> 11:47.337
This is so cool.

11:47.337 --> 11:50.040
Childish... but cool.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.543
More bubbles comin' up.

11:53.543 --> 11:55.515
Adam, stop.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.547
If that gum gets on
any of the equipment,

11:57.547 --> 11:59.389
Mr. Davenport
is gonna freak out.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.523
- Adam!
- ( laughing )

12:03.523 --> 12:04.855
That's it.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.061
Hey!

12:11.061 --> 12:13.363
You're a black hole
of fun.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.573
Seriously?

12:23.573 --> 12:25.745
You got gum
all over my gloves.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.417
( frustrated groan )

12:28.578 --> 12:30.851
Hey, can I turn
the zero gravity back on?

12:30.851 --> 12:32.953
I just drank
a gallon of water,

12:32.953 --> 12:35.786
and there's something else
I've always wanted to do
in space.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.395
Chase, do you see anything?

12:45.395 --> 12:47.637
No. I don't get it.

12:47.637 --> 12:49.399
There's no structural damage.

12:49.399 --> 12:51.771
Hang on, I'll do a scan.

12:57.607 --> 12:59.950
That's weird.

12:59.950 --> 13:02.012
The signal was shut off
at the colony.

13:02.012 --> 13:04.414
Someone back there
must be tampering with it.

13:04.414 --> 13:05.856
Who would do that?

13:05.856 --> 13:07.587
I don't know.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.289
This sounds like a job
for Zolton.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.191
- I'll get the helmet.
- No.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.624
Hang on, I'm coming in.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.002
Uh, Chase,
door's over here, bud.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.934
I know. Adam's gum
jammed the controls.

13:23.934 --> 13:25.475
They're stuck.

13:27.637 --> 13:30.280
Hang on.
I think I got it.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.312
( screaming )

13:32.312 --> 13:34.644
- ( screaming continues )
- What are you doing?

13:34.644 --> 13:37.487
It won't stop.
Help!

13:37.487 --> 13:39.850
Okay, Adam, we have to fly
the ship and go get him.

13:39.850 --> 13:40.851
Got it.

13:40.851 --> 13:42.492
Do you know how to do that?

13:42.492 --> 13:44.925
Nope. Ooh, but I bet
Zolton does.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.526
Now can I get the helmet?

13:47.958 --> 13:51.031
- Adam, this is serious.
- Okay, fine.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.263
Maybe this'll do it.

13:55.936 --> 13:59.169
Ah. There's
those windshield wipers.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.748
Chase!

14:08.748 --> 14:10.420
Chase!

14:10.420 --> 14:12.752
He's not responding.
He must be out of range.

14:12.752 --> 14:15.585
Great. He's speeding off
into space,

14:15.585 --> 14:16.987
and we have no idea
how to work this thing.

14:16.987 --> 14:19.359
Way to come up here
unprepared, Bree.

14:20.590 --> 14:22.532
Wait. There's
someone on the ship.

14:22.532 --> 14:26.336
( loud yawn )

14:26.336 --> 14:28.999
Perry? What are you
doing here?

14:28.999 --> 14:30.740
Took a nap
in the engine room.

14:30.740 --> 14:32.572
I find the violent rumble
of rocket engines

14:32.572 --> 14:36.176
to be soothing,
but the fumes knock me out cold.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.578
Okay, we lost Chase
in space.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.551
- Score!
- No, this is serious.

14:41.551 --> 14:43.153
We don't know
how to fly this thing,

14:43.153 --> 14:44.915
and if we don't
figure it out,

14:44.915 --> 14:46.987
- we're gonna
lose him forever.
- Score!

14:46.987 --> 14:48.919
Okay, you know what?
Forget it.

14:48.919 --> 14:50.160
I will just figure out
how to fly this thing myself.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.692
( console beeping,
alarm blaring )

14:52.692 --> 14:54.864
Okay, I'm done.

14:54.864 --> 14:57.327
Relax. I used to be
an astronaut.

14:57.327 --> 14:58.698
I know how
to fly this bird.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.101
- Yeah, right.
- I do.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.572
Back in the day,
me and my buddy Buck Champ

15:02.572 --> 15:04.734
used to ride rings
around Neptune,

15:04.734 --> 15:07.307
till an unfortunate
ejector seat accident.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.109
Okay.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.041
You know what?
That's it.

15:11.041 --> 15:13.213
You never had
any of these jobs.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.985
You were never
an astronaut,

15:14.985 --> 15:17.287
you never played
basketball in Romania,

15:17.287 --> 15:19.649
you never knocked out
Muhammad Ali.

15:19.649 --> 15:21.891
You are a liar.

15:21.891 --> 15:23.653
Hey, I don't lie.

15:23.653 --> 15:25.655
When you get fired from
as many jobs as I do,

15:25.655 --> 15:27.827
you gotta take
whatever you can get.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.229
- Why did you get
fired so much?
- For lying.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.902
Okay, T-minus ten
to lift-off.

15:32.902 --> 15:35.265
Hydraulics engaged.

15:35.265 --> 15:38.938
Boosting the vector rates
of the orbital thrusters.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.641
We are set
for maximum propulsion.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.044
- What does that mean?
- It means sit back
and shut your trap.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.616
I'm drivin' this beast!

15:50.650 --> 15:52.752
The hole in the dome
is bigger than I thought.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.224
We have to hurry.

15:54.224 --> 15:55.825
Power up your jet pack.
Let's go.

15:55.825 --> 15:57.427
- On it.
- Are you sure
this is safe?

15:57.427 --> 15:59.489
He's just a boy.

15:59.489 --> 16:01.631
Maybe you could hold hands
when you're up there.

16:01.631 --> 16:03.963
Mom!

16:03.963 --> 16:05.665
Can we?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.297
Everything is gonna be fine.

16:07.297 --> 16:08.898
We just have to hurry.

16:08.898 --> 16:10.870
Tasha, I need you to keep
the colonists calm.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.672
Can you do that?

16:12.672 --> 16:15.705
Please, Donald, I am
more than capable in a crisis.

16:15.705 --> 16:18.808
Listen up, colony people.

16:18.808 --> 16:20.710
My name is
Tasha Davenport.

16:20.710 --> 16:23.053
A major news reporter
from the Earth.

16:23.053 --> 16:25.285
Major?

16:25.285 --> 16:27.117
As you all know,
we are dealing with

16:27.117 --> 16:30.290
a horrible disaster,
but good news.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.792
My husband and son
are going up to fix it.

16:35.465 --> 16:38.898
Which means most of you
probably won't die.

16:44.874 --> 16:48.708
Mitzi, Beef,
get over here.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.481
I think I found the vapor trail
from Chris' jet pack.

16:52.782 --> 16:54.514
His name is Chase.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.116
Call him whatever you want.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.017
He ain't gonna be around
to hear it.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.352
I think he crash-landed
on that planet.

17:02.352 --> 17:04.194
How? He would've burned up
as soon as he entered

17:04.194 --> 17:05.625
the planet's atmosphere.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.057
What are we waitin' for?

17:07.057 --> 17:08.698
Let's land this baby,
grab his bones,

17:08.698 --> 17:10.029
and bury them
next to Buck.

17:17.607 --> 17:20.369
None of our navigation
devices are working
on this planet.

17:20.369 --> 17:22.872
How are we supposed to track
Chase's location?

17:22.872 --> 17:24.414
This place is creepy.

17:24.414 --> 17:26.846
I'm more worried there's
something tracking us.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.578
( Chase screaming )

17:28.578 --> 17:30.680
Aliens!

17:30.680 --> 17:32.882
Get off of me.

17:32.882 --> 17:34.954
It's not aliens,
it's Chase.

17:34.954 --> 17:37.187
Come on.

17:37.187 --> 17:39.889
( screaming )

17:39.889 --> 17:42.031
Help me up.

17:44.394 --> 17:46.065
How did you survive?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.897
My force field prevented me
from burning up

17:47.897 --> 17:50.570
in the atmosphere
and cushioned my landing.

17:52.372 --> 17:55.875
Hey, look, there is
intelligent life here.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.948
The aliens put their sprinklers
on a timer.

17:58.948 --> 18:03.253
BREE: Oh, no, they got water on
my navigation device.

18:03.253 --> 18:06.686
That's not water.
It's acid. Run!

18:08.087 --> 18:10.019
We need to relax
and enjoy things

18:10.019 --> 18:11.261
when we're on vacation.

18:11.261 --> 18:13.923
It's always go, go, go.

18:21.931 --> 18:25.275
Oh, good.
You made it back.

18:25.275 --> 18:27.277
Two more minutes,
and I was gonna ditch ya.

18:27.277 --> 18:30.810
How is she...

18:30.810 --> 18:33.743
You know what?
I don't even wanna know.

18:33.743 --> 18:35.685
Glad that's over.

18:35.685 --> 18:37.187
That place was scary,
huh, Chase?

18:37.187 --> 18:38.918
Don't talk to me.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.089
What? Why?

18:40.089 --> 18:42.021
Because of you,
I almost died.

18:42.021 --> 18:44.254
We all almost died.

18:44.254 --> 18:45.825
When are you gonna realize

18:45.825 --> 18:48.027
that your stupid actions
have consequences?

18:48.027 --> 18:49.929
- Chase...
- Don't Chase me.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.362
You're always saying
you wanna be treated
like an adult.

18:52.362 --> 18:54.264
Well, here's an idea.

18:54.264 --> 18:57.937
Why don't you grow up
and start acting like one?

18:57.937 --> 19:02.011
Until then, we may
be brothers, but I
am not your friend.

19:07.877 --> 19:11.321
Aw. You look like
you could use a hug.

19:12.982 --> 19:16.155
Whoa! I never said you were
gettin' one from me.

19:22.732 --> 19:24.494
The molecular sealant
is patching the hole,

19:24.494 --> 19:26.696
but there's still
one area I can't reach.

19:26.696 --> 19:29.999
In less than a minute, the
dome's gonna run out of oxygen.

19:29.999 --> 19:31.371
Let me try.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.543
No! It's too dangerous.

19:33.543 --> 19:35.505
You'll probably get
sucked out into space.

19:35.505 --> 19:37.006
I'll do it.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.179
Almost there.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.312
Almost there.

19:42.312 --> 19:43.883
Big D., be careful.

19:46.656 --> 19:47.757
I got you.

19:54.664 --> 19:57.327
Hang on.
I'll reverse my thrusters.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.199
It's not working.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.001
The suction's too strong.

20:02.001 --> 20:04.834
Don't worry.
I got this.

20:10.079 --> 20:13.243
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh what?

20:13.243 --> 20:15.985
Nothing.
When I pull you back in,

20:15.985 --> 20:17.887
spray the sealant
and patch the hole.

20:19.649 --> 20:21.891
- Leo.
- Just do it!

20:30.660 --> 20:32.702
Grab my hand.

20:34.664 --> 20:35.705
Hurry.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.478
We did it.

20:49.979 --> 20:53.152
You know, in honor of me
saving your life,

20:53.152 --> 20:57.487
I'm thinking we should
rename this place Dooleyopolis.

20:57.487 --> 20:59.989
What is it with you
and your mom

20:59.989 --> 21:02.161
trying to put your name
on everything?

21:07.567 --> 21:10.740
Feels good to be back
on the Daven ground.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.975
Wait. Where is everyone?

21:15.975 --> 21:17.977
Mom?

21:17.977 --> 21:20.610
Mom?

21:20.610 --> 21:22.251
That is weird.
Where did they go?

21:25.054 --> 21:28.588
Mr. Davenport,
the satellite's fine.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.060
The signal was manipulated
from here.

21:31.060 --> 21:33.893
What? That doesn't
make any sense.

21:36.225 --> 21:38.067
( footsteps approaching )

21:46.305 --> 21:49.979
It really is Zolton.

21:49.979 --> 21:51.881
Who are you?

21:51.881 --> 21:54.384
You know exactly
who I am.

22:04.053 --> 22:05.224
Krane.

22:15.835 --> 22:19.168
I knew you'd show up
sooner or later.

22:19.168 --> 22:21.170
Where's my wife?

22:21.170 --> 22:22.642
What have you done
with the colonists?

22:22.642 --> 22:24.213
In due time.

22:24.213 --> 22:26.175
But for now,
what do you say

22:26.175 --> 22:29.048
we focus on
our little reunion?

22:31.020 --> 22:32.882
Just for the sake
of asking,

22:32.882 --> 22:35.284
if we were
to sacrifice Tasha...

22:35.284 --> 22:36.626
Get over here.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.289
We blasted you
miles into the sky.

22:40.289 --> 22:41.991
How are you even alive?

22:41.991 --> 22:43.833
What are the odds
he'd land here?

22:45.064 --> 22:48.968
( garbled speech )

22:48.968 --> 22:51.641
What?

22:51.641 --> 22:53.703
I said...

22:53.703 --> 22:56.375
( garbled speech )

22:56.375 --> 22:59.849
Still not gettin' it.
Sounds like something's
jammed in your air duct.

23:02.281 --> 23:05.114
- Better?
- ALL: Yeah.

23:06.856 --> 23:10.690
When I fell back to Earth,
I sustained severe injuries.

23:10.690 --> 23:13.062
This face plate
helps me breathe.

23:13.062 --> 23:14.564
Well, I think I speak
for all of us

23:14.564 --> 23:16.225
when I say it's an upgrade,

23:16.225 --> 23:17.867
because that chain of
paper clips you had

23:17.867 --> 23:19.068
hangin' off your face
was not working.

23:24.273 --> 23:27.907
Okay. Still got
that old trick.

23:27.907 --> 23:31.410
And a few new ones, too.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.082
How did you
get up here?

23:33.082 --> 23:36.385
I used a cyber cloak,
pretended I was a colonist.

23:36.385 --> 23:38.918
Remember Roberta
from Kentucky?

23:38.918 --> 23:41.350
It all makes sense now.

23:41.350 --> 23:43.693
The satellite,
the hole in the dome.

23:43.693 --> 23:45.294
It was you.

23:45.294 --> 23:48.227
When I heard you were
creating a space colony

23:48.227 --> 23:49.629
in another galaxy,

23:49.629 --> 23:52.361
I realized this was
my perfect opportunity.

23:52.361 --> 23:56.065
To become a middle-aged
Southern woman?

23:56.065 --> 24:00.269
To create a new base camp
for my bionic army,

24:00.269 --> 24:03.112
far away from
any meddling humans.

24:03.112 --> 24:05.515
Well, you don't have
a bionic army anymore.

24:05.515 --> 24:07.016
They work for us now.

24:07.016 --> 24:08.578
I have a new army.

24:08.578 --> 24:10.319
Your colonists.

24:10.319 --> 24:12.822
They're about to be
implanted with bionics,

24:12.822 --> 24:15.755
which brings me to
Dr. Gao.

24:18.257 --> 24:21.931
Dr. Gao is a scientist
who's come up with a new way

24:21.931 --> 24:23.493
of creating
bionic humans.

24:23.493 --> 24:25.695
Liquid injection.

24:25.695 --> 24:29.168
We will never let you
put bionics in those
innocent people.

24:30.339 --> 24:32.441
You won't have a choice.

24:32.441 --> 24:35.605
Look familiar?

24:35.605 --> 24:37.346
With the Triton App device,

24:37.346 --> 24:39.348
I can make you do
anything I want.

24:39.348 --> 24:42.251
Nice try, but the Triton App
won't work on us.

24:42.251 --> 24:45.154
Mr. Davenport put a block
in our chips.

24:45.154 --> 24:48.487
You may have a block,
but your father doesn't.

24:51.290 --> 24:52.522
Chase!

24:54.594 --> 24:56.195
No!

24:57.266 --> 25:01.430
( evil laughter )

25:01.430 --> 25:04.173
Who's your daddy now?

25:04.173 --> 25:06.235
Big D.

25:06.235 --> 25:07.506
It's too late.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.508
He's already under
Krane's control.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.241
Please, whatever you do,

25:12.241 --> 25:14.243
don't turn me into
a bionic soldier.

25:14.243 --> 25:16.315
Just puttin' on
a little show for the kids.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.487
I'm all yours.

25:18.487 --> 25:20.219
Pass.

25:21.851 --> 25:24.223
Gao, come and get
the newest member
of my army.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.494
Gladly.

25:25.494 --> 25:27.496
Don't even
think about it.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.762
( laughing )

25:37.006 --> 25:38.838
Wait, he can geo-leap?

25:38.838 --> 25:40.670
After I fell
back to Earth,

25:40.670 --> 25:43.042
Dr. Gao was the only person
who could fix me.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.144
Since he's a scientist,
I paid him back

25:45.144 --> 25:47.577
with my most precious
resource--

25:47.577 --> 25:51.220
the same bionic secrets
Douglas gave me.

25:53.823 --> 25:56.225
With those secrets,

25:56.225 --> 25:59.589
I was able to apply
my own science

25:59.589 --> 26:02.431
to create this.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.737
Liquid bionics.

26:09.639 --> 26:14.143
Once this bionic fluid
enters the human bloodstream,

26:14.143 --> 26:17.406
the compounds
begin to solidify,

26:17.406 --> 26:20.449
forming a bionic
infrastructure

26:20.449 --> 26:23.713
that communicates
with the muscles and brain,

26:23.713 --> 26:29.919
creating one incredibly
powerful bionic human.

26:29.919 --> 26:32.561
Why are you helping
a madman?

26:32.561 --> 26:34.724
( laughs )

26:34.724 --> 26:37.496
Who's to say

26:37.496 --> 26:40.269
I'm not madder
than he is?

26:41.901 --> 26:43.733
Destroy them.

26:58.147 --> 26:59.448
Yoo-hoo.

26:59.448 --> 27:00.890
Still here.

27:00.890 --> 27:03.953
Just waiting to be
bionicated.

27:03.953 --> 27:07.326
Look, lady,
pass means pass.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.158
( shrieks )

27:13.132 --> 27:14.804
Ah!

27:14.804 --> 27:16.505
Is it just me,
or does Krane have

27:16.505 --> 27:20.840
a really bad case of
the Terry Perrys?

27:20.840 --> 27:23.372
What are you talking about?
The man tried to kill you.

27:23.372 --> 27:26.475
That's right.
A crime of passion.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.648
Guys, we have got
to do something

27:29.648 --> 27:31.951
before they inject
Mr. Davenport and Tasha

27:31.951 --> 27:34.223
and turn them into
bionic soldiers.

27:34.223 --> 27:37.056
Yeah. Although it would
be kinda cool to see Tasha
with bionics.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.288
Ooh, she could be
the world's first
flying news reporter.

27:39.288 --> 27:42.331
She could interview birds.

27:42.331 --> 27:44.193
I know this is
a tall order,

27:44.193 --> 27:46.665
but can you please
think before you speak?

27:46.665 --> 27:48.467
Thought you weren't
talking to me.

27:48.467 --> 27:51.370
( scoffs )
I'm not.

27:51.370 --> 27:52.972
- Okay, you just did.
- No. No, I didn't.

27:52.972 --> 27:56.175
- Yeah, you did.
- No. I talked at him.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.147
- There's a difference.
- No, not really.

27:58.147 --> 28:00.880
Can we please just get
back to Mr. Davenport
and Tasha?!

28:03.512 --> 28:06.455
You know, Don and Tasha
have given us

28:06.455 --> 28:08.557
some really good memories.

28:08.557 --> 28:11.220
Maybe we should just
treasure them and move on.

28:11.220 --> 28:12.461
Who gets their stuff?

28:12.461 --> 28:14.894
Wait a minute.
Where's Leo?

28:14.894 --> 28:18.527
You know, Leo has given us
some really good memories.

28:18.527 --> 28:21.871
Wait. Where is Leo?

28:21.871 --> 28:24.703
Leo is busy...

28:24.703 --> 28:27.036
coming up with
his own plan.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.841
Nice. That's exactly
the firepower we need.

28:31.841 --> 28:34.413
Where'd you get it?

28:34.413 --> 28:36.115
I packed it
on the spacecraft.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.620
Did you really think
I'd fly out here empty-handed?

28:41.620 --> 28:43.692
I've seen enough
space movies

28:43.692 --> 28:46.525
to know that the fourth banana
gets it right out of the gate.

28:54.403 --> 28:58.407
Time to begin building
our bionic army.

28:58.407 --> 29:01.410
I say we start with
the tiny vain one.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.614
LEO: Not so fast,
chin strap.

29:05.614 --> 29:09.178
Ha! Didn't think we'd find
you, did you?

29:09.178 --> 29:11.981
The entire colony
is one square mile.

29:11.981 --> 29:13.823
Yeah, well,
we walked that mile,

29:13.823 --> 29:15.825
and we found you.

29:17.286 --> 29:20.930
You really think
that toy

29:20.930 --> 29:22.591
is going to do anything

29:22.591 --> 29:26.095
to the two most powerful
beings in the universe?

29:26.095 --> 29:28.597
We're about to find out.

29:28.597 --> 29:30.599
Get him!

29:33.342 --> 29:35.274
( shrieking )

29:35.274 --> 29:36.675
Leo, keep shooting.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.682
You imbecile.
What are you doing?

29:43.682 --> 29:44.914
Bree, now.

29:53.923 --> 29:55.364
Let's finish this, Leo.

30:01.270 --> 30:03.272
That should do it.

30:03.272 --> 30:04.934
Come on, we have to
get out of here.

30:04.934 --> 30:06.805
- What about Gao?
- We don't have time.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.607
The entire dome
is about to collapse.

30:08.607 --> 30:11.110
We have to get everyone
to the spacecraft fast.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.842
So now you're
talkin' to me again.

30:12.842 --> 30:15.284
Just go!

30:25.094 --> 30:27.696
All right, the colonists
are locked up in the back

30:27.696 --> 30:29.198
with Davenport and Tasha.

30:29.198 --> 30:30.699
Great. Once we get
back to Earth,

30:30.699 --> 30:32.601
we can deactivate
their Triton Apps.

30:32.601 --> 30:34.503
Do we have to?

30:34.503 --> 30:37.106
I think Mr. Davenport looks
kinda nice with green eyes.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.771
That dome's about to come down.
We need to get out of here.

30:42.771 --> 30:44.914
Saddle up, skin boards.

30:44.914 --> 30:46.645
This filly's locked
and loaded

30:46.645 --> 30:48.777
and rarin' to jam out
of the space rock stable.

30:48.777 --> 30:51.480
That one's for you, Buck.

30:59.588 --> 31:02.661
Wow, looks like we made it
out of there just in time.

31:02.661 --> 31:03.993
Yeah.

31:03.993 --> 31:06.335
Okay, I don't know
about you guys,

31:06.335 --> 31:08.167
but all this space stuff
has me worn out.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.669
I'm gonna take a nice,
little inter-galactic nap.

31:10.669 --> 31:13.742
Chase, just hurry up
and get us home.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.381
All right,
I'll plot a course.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.713
I think we can take a shortcut
through the Andromeda galaxy.

31:33.562 --> 31:36.165
Should be
smooth sailing from here.

31:48.907 --> 31:53.912
Worst vacation ever.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.544
Tell me about it.

31:55.544 --> 31:57.146
What do you say tomorrow,
we hit the day spa

31:57.146 --> 31:59.148
and get our armpits waxed?

31:59.148 --> 32:01.320
It'll be a nice change
from goin' to the barber shop.

32:04.553 --> 32:08.097
Hey, Leo looks nice
with green eyes, too.

32:10.559 --> 32:12.931
That's the Triton App.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.404
- Why is he aiming at us?
- Watch out!

32:17.466 --> 32:18.637
Get behind me.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.644
For a guy who throws
like my grandma,

32:25.644 --> 32:27.776
he's got really good aim.

32:27.776 --> 32:30.549
When I put
my force field down,

32:30.549 --> 32:32.621
you use your super speed
to take him out.

32:32.621 --> 32:33.952
Then you subdue him.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.484
- Got it.
- No problem.

32:35.484 --> 32:36.655
Be careful.
We don't wanna hurt him.

32:36.655 --> 32:38.227
Speak for yourself.

32:38.227 --> 32:40.229
Go!

32:46.565 --> 32:49.068
Nice work, everybody.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.839
Indeed.

32:50.839 --> 32:53.072
Very impressive.

32:53.072 --> 32:56.105
Aw, thanks, Dr. Gao.
( gasps ) Dr. Gao!

32:57.776 --> 32:59.908
Did you really think
I would just run away

32:59.908 --> 33:02.051
and let you go home?

33:02.051 --> 33:04.513
I'm just getting started.

33:04.513 --> 33:06.955
Capturing your little
space colony

33:06.955 --> 33:11.060
was just a small piece
of our much-greater plan.

33:11.060 --> 33:13.392
To begin again.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.324
What do you mean,
begin again?

33:15.324 --> 33:18.727
Wiping out
all human existence on Earth,

33:18.727 --> 33:22.131
and repopulating it
with a better, stronger,

33:22.131 --> 33:24.133
bionic civilization.

33:25.834 --> 33:28.677
Once I launch
my Doomsday missile,

33:28.677 --> 33:31.810
it will start a nuclear winter,
taking out all life.

33:31.810 --> 33:35.484
Then I will inject
your colonists

33:35.484 --> 33:39.017
with what remains
of my bionic liquid,

33:39.017 --> 33:42.321
and my new race
of superhumans will thrive.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.893
Not if we stop you first.

33:44.893 --> 33:47.226
Too late.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.458
I just launched the rocket.

33:49.458 --> 33:52.501
In minutes, the human race
will be a distant memory,

33:52.501 --> 33:56.835
and there's nothing you pathetic
little bionic heroes

33:56.835 --> 33:58.467
can do about it.

34:07.776 --> 34:10.179
Well, let's wrap
this up, shall we?

34:10.179 --> 34:12.420
I got colonists
to inject,

34:12.420 --> 34:14.853
and a bionic army
to assemble.

34:14.853 --> 34:18.025
The workday grind
just never ends.

34:21.029 --> 34:22.860
- Get him!
- Yeah, get him!

34:25.864 --> 34:27.396
Whoa!

34:27.396 --> 34:29.197
Destroy them!

34:29.197 --> 34:31.940
Yeah. Destroy them!

34:31.940 --> 34:34.203
Really?

34:34.203 --> 34:36.775
What? I'm trying to end up
on the winning side.

34:40.279 --> 34:41.550
What now?

34:43.552 --> 34:45.013
CHASE:
Gao's controlling him.

34:45.013 --> 34:47.856
Wait. I have an idea.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.688
Hey, Leo,
catch me.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.723
If you...

34:54.723 --> 34:56.024
...can.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.172
Cool.

35:03.172 --> 35:04.933
Nice work, team.

35:04.933 --> 35:07.005
I never doubted you
for a minute.

35:07.005 --> 35:09.007
Lock him up
in the back,

35:09.007 --> 35:11.009
and take Leo with you.

35:11.009 --> 35:13.011
Now that Gao's out of it,
he's not controlling him
anymore.

35:13.011 --> 35:14.843
Got it.

35:14.843 --> 35:16.845
I haven't seen him
look this dazed

35:16.845 --> 35:18.317
since he walked in
on my yoga class.

35:19.918 --> 35:21.420
Come with me, Dooley.

35:27.095 --> 35:28.857
What was that?

35:28.857 --> 35:30.629
Something hit us.

35:32.601 --> 35:34.463
( evil laughter )

35:36.665 --> 35:40.269
It's Krane.
He's got one of
the colony's space pods.

35:40.269 --> 35:43.772
I'm not a fan,
but this guy really commits.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.145
( laughing )

35:47.145 --> 35:49.648
Time for a little payback.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.153
Man your stations.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.656
Oh, now I get
a seat up front.

35:57.656 --> 35:58.757
Just sit!

36:01.960 --> 36:04.733
All right, let's do this.
Loading missiles.

36:10.599 --> 36:13.171
If I can't have my army,

36:13.171 --> 36:15.344
I'm taking you out
with them!

36:20.679 --> 36:21.910
He just blew up
the weapons bank.

36:21.910 --> 36:24.082
We can't defend ourselves.

36:24.082 --> 36:26.084
No, we still have the missile
that I just loaded.

36:26.084 --> 36:27.256
Prepare to launch.

36:27.256 --> 36:28.587
Activating homing system.

36:28.587 --> 36:29.988
Target is locked.

36:29.988 --> 36:31.390
Prepare to fire in
three, two...

36:36.665 --> 36:38.096
He just took out
the homing system.

36:38.096 --> 36:39.828
The computer can't aim
the missile without it.

36:39.828 --> 36:42.000
Then I'm just gonna
have to do it myself.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.881
Tracking.

36:52.881 --> 36:55.914
Got you right where
I want you.

36:59.147 --> 37:00.319
Tracking.

37:03.091 --> 37:05.394
Good-bye, my bionic friends.

37:07.055 --> 37:09.057
And good riddance!

37:10.058 --> 37:11.159
Now!

37:13.562 --> 37:16.435
( screaming )

37:23.141 --> 37:26.315
- You did it!
- Nice job, bro.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.048
Thanks.

37:30.048 --> 37:33.151
Hey, what's with
all the commotion?

37:33.151 --> 37:34.883
Did the big one
push another button?

37:37.155 --> 37:40.389
So where do you want me
to fly this thing?

37:40.389 --> 37:42.931
You know, now that the Earth
is gonna be uninhabitable.

37:42.931 --> 37:45.063
Gao's rocket.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.569
It's gonna hit Earth
in four minutes,

37:50.569 --> 37:51.970
and we don't have
anything to intercept it.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.572
We can't stop it.

37:53.572 --> 37:56.074
I can if I use
Mr. Davenport's

37:56.074 --> 37:57.946
high-velocity
escape suit.

37:57.946 --> 37:59.478
Chase, that's too risky.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.780
Your body could never
withstand the force.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.552
You'll be
ripped to shreds.

38:05.053 --> 38:06.885
I'll do it.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.887
What?

38:08.887 --> 38:11.360
Adam, did you not hear me?
You could die.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.892
My super strength will give me
a better chance of survival.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.124
I think one casualty
versus an entire planet

38:16.124 --> 38:17.996
is worth the risk.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.168
- Adam...
- Let me do this, Chase.

38:20.168 --> 38:22.671
You were right.
I need to grow up.

38:24.473 --> 38:26.505
And this is my time.

38:29.878 --> 38:31.179
Okay.

38:41.950 --> 38:43.952
It's gonna be
very difficult
for you to see

38:43.952 --> 38:45.824
when you're traveling
that fast.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.125
I'll help you navigate
on the com set.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.957
And I'll monitor
your vitals.

38:48.957 --> 38:50.999
Adam, you ready?

38:50.999 --> 38:53.061
Ready.

38:53.061 --> 38:55.804
Wait. Just in case
you don't make it back,

38:55.804 --> 38:59.207
I want you to know that
you were always my favorite.

38:59.207 --> 39:02.711
But that's not
sayin' much.

39:02.711 --> 39:05.213
I've located
the Doomsday rocket.

39:05.213 --> 39:07.215
If you're going to stop it,
you have to match its speed.

39:07.215 --> 39:08.276
Copy.

39:08.276 --> 39:10.178
Engage thrusters.

39:10.178 --> 39:12.921
Uh...

39:12.921 --> 39:17.025
Turn up the things
that make you go faster.

39:17.025 --> 39:20.529
Got it.
Engaging thrusters.

39:24.132 --> 39:25.534
How you doing, Adam?

39:25.534 --> 39:27.896
Uh, I think I'm all right.

39:27.896 --> 39:31.700
I'm seeing stars, but that
could be because I'm in space.

39:33.702 --> 39:35.744
We have to hurry.

39:35.744 --> 39:37.876
Increase thrust to 85%.

39:40.278 --> 39:41.710
Oh!

39:44.382 --> 39:47.756
Okay, Adam, 95%.

39:47.756 --> 39:49.518
Got it.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.222
Keep going, Adam.
 Faster.

39:54.222 --> 39:56.294
Chase, his heart rate
is going through the roof.

39:56.294 --> 39:57.365
I don't think he can
take much more.

39:57.365 --> 39:59.067
He has to try.

39:59.067 --> 40:00.128
You okay, Adam?

40:00.128 --> 40:01.870
Yeah.

40:01.870 --> 40:04.032
Keep going.
You're at 100%.

40:07.035 --> 40:10.208
Just so you know,
it really hurts.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.240
I think I'm burning up.

40:12.240 --> 40:15.243
Push it further.
You have to go past the limit.

40:15.243 --> 40:16.445
Okay.

40:16.445 --> 40:18.447
( screaming )

40:20.348 --> 40:22.190
Guys, if I don't make it...

40:22.190 --> 40:23.852
You're gonna make it.
You're almost there.

40:23.852 --> 40:26.124
Chase, it's too much.
Make him stop, please.

40:26.124 --> 40:29.297
Guys, if I don't make it,
 I want you to know

40:29.297 --> 40:31.930
- that you're
 the best family...
 - ( static )

40:34.302 --> 40:36.905
Adam.

40:36.905 --> 40:38.036
Adam!

40:38.036 --> 40:40.539
Adam!

40:40.539 --> 40:43.271
( beeping )

40:43.271 --> 40:46.444
Something's wrong.
He's slowing down.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.276
What? No.

40:48.276 --> 40:50.178
Adam! Answer me!

40:50.178 --> 40:52.180
Come on, big guy,
come on.

40:52.180 --> 40:54.583
Adam!

40:54.583 --> 40:58.026
( beeping slows,
becomes continuous tone )

41:00.028 --> 41:03.431
- He's gone.
- No!

41:11.600 --> 41:14.142
( beeping resumes )

41:14.142 --> 41:17.776
Wait. Wait, look.
He's speeding up again.

41:17.776 --> 41:20.178
Adam, can you hear me?

41:20.178 --> 41:22.751
Yeah. Yeah, I can hear you.

41:22.751 --> 41:25.253
Sorry. I blacked out
for a few, but I'm back.

41:25.253 --> 41:27.516
We thought we lost you.

41:27.516 --> 41:30.018
Yeah, you're not gonna
lose me that easy.

41:30.018 --> 41:32.020
Hey, can you guys
hold on a second?

41:32.020 --> 41:34.763
I've got some unfinished
business to take care of.

41:37.926 --> 41:40.368
I think I see the rocket.
It's pretty close.

41:40.368 --> 41:42.170
It's about to enter
the earth's atmosphere.

41:42.170 --> 41:43.872
We don't have much time.

41:43.872 --> 41:46.104
If you can't stop it,
the entire planet is toast.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.676
Oh, I got this.

41:47.676 --> 41:49.678
You'll have to use
 your super strength

41:49.678 --> 41:51.309
to ram it head on.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.281
The suit should
 protect you.

41:53.281 --> 41:55.684
Okay. Here goes.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.538
CHASE: Adam!
Adam, are you there?

42:23.171 --> 42:26.374
Yeah, I'm here.

42:26.374 --> 42:28.416
Guys...

42:28.416 --> 42:29.648
I did it!

42:32.981 --> 42:34.552
Oh, you, uh...

42:34.552 --> 42:37.355
you know that other thing
I wanted to do in space?

42:37.355 --> 42:40.328
Mission accomplished.

42:46.935 --> 42:48.336
Well, Mr. Davenport,

42:48.336 --> 42:50.438
aside from losing
your entire space program,

42:50.438 --> 42:52.901
I'd say it was
a pretty successful trip.

42:52.901 --> 42:56.845
Yeah, it's not every day
you get to save the world
from total annihilation.

42:56.845 --> 42:59.207
I lost billions.

43:00.749 --> 43:03.111
Let's go, handsome.

43:03.111 --> 43:05.313
Are you taking him
to jail?

43:05.313 --> 43:06.985
That's what
some men call it.

43:08.386 --> 43:11.289
Help me!

43:11.289 --> 43:13.892
Well, I'm off, too.

43:13.892 --> 43:15.724
Where are you going?

43:15.724 --> 43:17.325
Greece.

43:17.325 --> 43:20.068
Honey, I really don't
feel like traveling.

43:20.068 --> 43:23.571
Oh, I didn't say
you were going.
Come on, Bree.

43:23.571 --> 43:25.133
Opa!

43:30.308 --> 43:31.279
Listen, Adam,

43:31.279 --> 43:33.311
I just wanted
to let you know

43:33.311 --> 43:35.283
how proud of you I am.

43:35.283 --> 43:37.716
And all those things
I said about you
being immature,

43:37.716 --> 43:39.317
you proved me wrong.

43:39.317 --> 43:41.720
Thank you, Chase,
and from now on,

43:41.720 --> 43:45.123
I'm gonna be
a perfectly
responsible adult.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.394
Great.

43:47.896 --> 43:49.597
You know it's never
gonna happen, right?

43:49.597 --> 43:51.059
Yeah, I figured as much.

43:52.630 --> 43:55.063
Hey, Big D.
I almost forgot.

43:55.063 --> 43:56.905
The space colonists
wanted me to
give you this.

43:56.905 --> 43:59.067
A thank-you note?

43:59.067 --> 44:00.809
Yeah.

44:00.809 --> 44:03.311
In the form of
a lawsuit.
