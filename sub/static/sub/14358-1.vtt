WEBVTT

00:01.890 --> 00:04.930
"Pilot"

00:09.726 --> 00:12.050
Hello? Hello?

00:12.170 --> 00:13.460
Can you hear me?

00:13.495 --> 00:14.530
Oh, damn it.

00:15.874 --> 00:16.681
Come on!

00:16.716 --> 00:18.807
<i>Some people call this
the middle of nowhere...</i>

00:19.210 --> 00:21.600
<i>You know, one of
those places you fly over</i>

00:21.601 --> 00:23.990
<i>on your way from somewhere
to somewhere else,</i>

00:24.060 --> 00:25.633
<i>but you wouldn't live here.</i>

00:26.540 --> 00:29.132
Folks, right now we're flyingover
the great state of Indiana,

00:29.167 --> 00:30.538
if you'd like
to take a look.

00:32.990 --> 00:36.949
<i>Well, look down next time, and you'll
see us down here in the middle--</i>

00:37.320 --> 00:39.886
<i>Orson, Indiana,
heart of the heartland,</i>

00:39.921 --> 00:42.250
<i>proud home
of Little Betty Snack Cakes,</i>

00:42.300 --> 00:46.532
<i>the demolition derby for the homeless
and the world's largest polyurethane cow.</i>

00:47.470 --> 00:50.026
So how'd I end up in the middle
of the road in this getup?

00:50.150 --> 00:50.829
Here? No.

00:51.311 --> 00:52.455
Bars! I got bars.

00:52.650 --> 00:55.072
<i>Guess it all started
a couple of weeks ago,</i>

00:55.214 --> 00:58.070
<i>and no, I'm not
an actual superhero,</i>

00:58.230 --> 01:00.027
<i>not unless you count
getting my kids out the door</i>

01:00.062 --> 01:01.261
<i>for school every morning.</i>

01:01.750 --> 01:03.120
I made breakfast!

01:03.180 --> 01:04.968
Come on, we're late!
Let's go, let's go!

01:05.680 --> 01:07.489
That's my youngest--
Brick.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.610
<i>You know how you think giving a kid
a cool name will make him cool?</i>

01:11.140 --> 01:12.546
<i>It doesn't.</i>

01:12.730 --> 01:14.251
Okay, now listen.

01:14.310 --> 01:16.323
Today at recess,
I don't want you

01:16.393 --> 01:19.447
wandering around alone
on the perimeter, all right?

01:19.482 --> 01:21.550
Makes you an easy target,
you know?

01:21.620 --> 01:24.098
Like--like the gazelle that gets
separated from the pack.

01:24.100 --> 01:26.138
You've gotta find yourself
a group of kids

01:26.139 --> 01:28.700
and just stand
near them.

01:29.980 --> 01:32.250
You know you're my hero,
right, Mom?

01:32.500 --> 01:34.022
Thank you, honey.
Eat your pancake.

01:34.110 --> 01:35.320
It's still frozen.

01:35.370 --> 01:37.270
Well, lick it.
It'll last longer.

01:37.710 --> 01:39.569
Hey, Mike, have you seen
that envelope

01:39.604 --> 01:41.530
with my driver's license
from the DMV?

01:41.560 --> 01:42.883
I need it for work.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.882
Why is this place
such a mess?

01:46.400 --> 01:48.702
<i>That one over there
would be Axl.</i>

01:49.030 --> 01:51.612
<i>Since he hit 15,
he hibernates in his room</i>

01:51.629 --> 01:53.634
<i>and only comes out
to paw through our food</i>

01:53.635 --> 01:55.667
<i>and shoot off
sarcastic comments.</i>

01:56.220 --> 01:57.986
Oh, we're
out of chips.

01:58.980 --> 02:00.380
Nice job, Mom.

02:00.450 --> 02:02.390
Yeah, I can't hear you
if you don't have pants on.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.490
Mom, where's my homework?

02:04.650 --> 02:06.654
Uh-huh! Okay.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.180
When did this happen?

02:15.570 --> 02:17.150
Mike, look at this.
Look at this.

02:17.190 --> 02:18.675
This is--I haven't had
my driver's license picture

02:18.710 --> 02:19.810
taken in seven years,
okay?

02:19.990 --> 02:21.098
- Mm-hmm.
- Here's the old one.

02:22.050 --> 02:22.956
Look at this.

02:23.180 --> 02:24.100
What happened to me?

02:24.119 --> 02:26.991
Uh, well, back then,
you were all young and shiny

02:27.026 --> 02:28.698
and wondering
what your life's gonna be.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.567
And now...
Well, now you know!

02:34.520 --> 02:35.940
Mom!

02:36.010 --> 02:37.920
Hey, come in here
if you want to talk to me.

02:37.990 --> 02:39.597
Axl, put some pants on.
Here.

02:41.090 --> 02:43.270
<i>Okay, maybe it was
just a bad picture.</i>

02:43.340 --> 02:45.485
<i>I mean, yikes.</i>

02:45.870 --> 02:50.776
Mike, does it ever bum you out that
I'm not young and shiny anymore?

02:50.830 --> 02:52.402
Well, sure, honey.
It's a huge bummer,

02:52.466 --> 02:54.100
but what are you gonna do?

02:54.390 --> 02:55.550
Oh, shoot!

02:55.585 --> 02:57.246
I wanted chips
for my lunch.

02:57.860 --> 02:58.959
She didn't buy any.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.350
Sue, grab a pancake.
We're late.

03:02.930 --> 03:03.990
<i>That's Sue.</i>

03:04.050 --> 03:05.969
<i>She's been going through
a bit of an awkward stage...</i>

03:06.396 --> 03:07.940
<i>for the past 13 years.</i>

03:08.010 --> 03:10.860
Mom, the dryer ate
my leg warmers again.

03:10.895 --> 03:14.210
I told you, you can't put
wet things in the dryer anymore.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.721
Well, I need 'em,
'cause guess what?

03:17.680 --> 03:19.722
I'm trying out
for show choir this week.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.173
<i>I know, I know--</i>

03:21.233 --> 03:23.850
<i>That's not an expression parents
should have on their faces</i>

03:23.885 --> 03:26.870
<i>when their daughter tells them
she's trying out for something.</i>

03:26.960 --> 03:30.380
<i>But see, Sue had a long history
of things she tried out for--</i>

03:30.790 --> 03:33.718
<i>A long and...
painful history.</i>

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:43.330 --> 03:44.676
Show choir.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.754
Wow, super.

03:45.824 --> 03:47.900
That--that should be
fun to try out for.

03:48.753 --> 03:50.785
Now listen, Dad's gonna
fix the dryer again,

03:50.820 --> 03:52.351
but right now, I just need
everybody to go.

03:52.386 --> 03:53.660
Let's get out the door.
Come on.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.240
- Let's go, let's go!
- Mom.

03:55.275 --> 03:59.599
<i>That driver's license picture was
a big wake-up call from the DMV.</i>

03:59.740 --> 04:02.830
<i>Somehow the life had been
sucked right out of me.</i>

04:03.020 --> 04:06.970
<i>But who or what
had sucked it?</i>

04:07.040 --> 04:10.110
- Mom, he's not giving my bag back!
- Mom, Mom, Mom.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.272
- Mom! Mom!
- Mom.

04:12.307 --> 04:15.149
We did teach 'em
the word "Dad," didn't we?

04:17.550 --> 04:19.596
<i>We're a two-job family.</i>

04:19.810 --> 04:22.801
<i>Mike manages a bunch of
boneheads down at the quarry.</i>

04:25.340 --> 04:27.339
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

04:29.170 --> 04:31.423
And my latest job
I'm too smart for,

04:31.458 --> 04:35.151
is selling cars at Orson's
last surviving car dealership.

04:35.152 --> 04:36.592
Well, well, well.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.019
What a month, huh?

04:39.830 --> 04:41.369
Frankie, don't let him
intimidate you.

04:41.410 --> 04:42.952
He may be the king
of sales around here,

04:42.992 --> 04:45.495
but he's been rejected by
the Elks Lodge twice.

04:45.620 --> 04:46.974
I'm not gonna say
by who.

04:47.430 --> 04:50.295
- It was me.
- Really?

04:51.550 --> 04:53.225
I told them that
he's a pedophile.

04:53.440 --> 04:54.902
- No.
- Yeah. He's not.

04:55.390 --> 04:57.980
He's not a pedophile.
He's not.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.825
- Wait, Bob.
- What?

04:59.845 --> 05:01.100
Okay, this check
can't be right.

05:01.140 --> 05:04.050
This is lower than the amount
I spent on gas to get here.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.272
Ain't nothing wrong with
the check, Frances.

05:06.520 --> 05:07.977
That there
is your base salary,

05:08.012 --> 05:10.523
and that's what it's gonna stay
until you sell a car

05:10.558 --> 05:11.640
and get a commission.

05:11.930 --> 05:13.848
Now one week left
in the month.

05:13.950 --> 05:17.143
You sell a car, or you may be
out on your keister.

05:18.688 --> 05:19.630
Yeah. Yeah.

05:19.665 --> 05:22.358
I, um...
but listen, I mean,

05:22.545 --> 05:26.517
my keister's having a little
cash flow problem right now.

05:26.620 --> 05:30.460
I may not have sold a car yet,
but I've come real close.

05:30.510 --> 05:31.759
See that buck up there?

05:32.280 --> 05:35.401
He came real close
to not being hit by a bullet.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.806
You see
what I'm saying?

05:37.840 --> 05:40.163
By the way, did you ever
get a new driver's license?

05:40.260 --> 05:41.444
We gotta post them,

05:41.515 --> 05:43.704
and that old one
didn't look a thing like you.

05:46.230 --> 05:48.169
Oh, yeah.
Now that's you.

05:51.590 --> 05:53.737
I see myself
as kind of a matchmaker

05:53.772 --> 05:54.830
for people and vehicles,

05:54.880 --> 05:58.190
and I just have a feeling
about you and this little cutie.

05:58.523 --> 06:00.098
Why don't we take it
for a test drive and--

06:00.133 --> 06:02.818
<i>Frankie, you have
a call on line one.</i>

06:03.200 --> 06:05.831
<i>Your son's school
is on line one.</i>

06:06.180 --> 06:07.720
Hurt, or just in trouble?

06:07.740 --> 06:08.632
'Cause if
it's just in trouble,

06:08.672 --> 06:10.571
can you ask him
if I call him back?

06:13.980 --> 06:16.835
Yeah, this is Frankie Heck.
Is everything okay?

06:20.940 --> 06:22.460
You said you were
gonna pick him up.

06:22.495 --> 06:24.052
No, you said you were.

06:24.087 --> 06:26.329
<i>I even put a post-it
on your thermos.</i>

06:28.480 --> 06:29.630
<i>Is that
what that means?</i>

06:31.666 --> 06:34.043
<i>There's birthday cake
in the break room.</i>

06:34.470 --> 06:35.574
<i>It's angel food.</i>

06:36.520 --> 06:38.625
Feel that?
Uh, take a left right here.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.926
Pretty smooth, huh?

06:41.940 --> 06:44.122
That's 150 horsepower.

06:44.220 --> 06:46.330
And did I tell you
about our recession deals?

06:46.370 --> 06:49.684
Oh, get in the right lane and
pull over, pull over, pull over!

06:50.869 --> 06:52.590
Quick, quick!
Get in, get in, get in!

06:56.820 --> 06:59.028
Brick, honey,
how do you like those seats?

06:59.050 --> 07:00.065
They're amazing.

07:00.190 --> 07:02.615
They also come with
optional leather trim

07:02.650 --> 07:04.601
and preferred suede inserts.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.829
And if you buy today,
I'll throw the inserts in for free.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.284
Mom, are you crazy?

07:09.460 --> 07:11.576
That's a $600 value.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.950
At least
you're still my hero.

07:17.985 --> 07:19.300
Aww, thanks, pal.

07:19.470 --> 07:20.738
I made dinner!

07:21.930 --> 07:23.206
- Thank you.
- Sure.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.217
Hey, Underpants, you think
you're too good for us?

07:26.660 --> 07:28.203
We are a family,

07:28.238 --> 07:30.953
and we are going to
eat <i>together</i> as a family.

07:32.810 --> 07:34.787
<i>This is
Dancing With the Stars.</i>

07:36.390 --> 07:38.489
Okay, quick, let's hear
about everybody's day.

07:38.610 --> 07:40.191
Mine sucked.
Next.

07:40.232 --> 07:42.129
Well, ahem,
I'm trying to decide

07:42.164 --> 07:44.704
what number I should do
for my show choir audition.

07:44.739 --> 07:46.816
- Oh, my God.
- What?

07:46.870 --> 07:48.021
Does it really matter
what song you pick?

07:48.056 --> 07:49.541
'Cause there's no way
you're gonna make it.

07:49.620 --> 07:50.514
- Mom!
- Mike.

07:50.554 --> 07:51.307
Axl.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.234
You know, your brother's
just trying to say

07:53.269 --> 07:54.961
you should just choose
whatever you want.

07:54.996 --> 07:58.060
Now me, I like a quick-song.
Quick, leave 'em wantin' more.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.220
You have a meeting with
my teacher on Monday.

08:02.250 --> 08:02.708
What?

08:02.738 --> 08:05.541
It's imperative that you
both be there, she says.

08:06.420 --> 08:08.247
Imperative!

08:08.790 --> 08:10.640
Who's he whispering to?
Why does he do that?

08:10.675 --> 08:12.135
I thought I told you
to knock that off.

08:12.170 --> 08:13.798
I like it.
It soothes me.

08:13.833 --> 08:15.062
Okay, what teacher's meeting?

08:15.102 --> 08:16.218
I didn't even
get a note.

08:20.310 --> 08:21.840
Oh, my God,
you're so weird.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.130
- Mom!
- Mike.

08:23.190 --> 08:23.929
Axl.

08:23.940 --> 08:27.110
Yeah, well, from what
I can tell, it is Monday.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.120
Okay,
we both work Monday.

08:29.170 --> 08:32.057
Sorry.
Sorry.

08:32.448 --> 08:33.671
Sorry.

08:36.679 --> 08:39.231
Did I tell you Hank at the quarry
found his finger today?

08:39.260 --> 08:40.610
Oh, really?
That's good.

08:41.049 --> 08:42.849
Mom, Dad.

08:43.515 --> 08:45.984
Are you guys
disappointed in me?

08:46.260 --> 08:48.614
You know,
'cause I never make anything?

08:48.930 --> 08:50.440
Oh, sure
I'm disappointed, hon.

08:50.475 --> 08:52.375
This is, like, the 12th thing
you've tried out for.

08:52.430 --> 08:54.450
I mean, I love not
having to go to the events.

08:55.780 --> 08:59.083
I'm thinking maybe I won't
try out for show choir...

08:59.765 --> 09:02.000
if you guys
don't think I should.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.350
<i>Of course she shouldn't.</i>

09:04.430 --> 09:07.238
<i>Show choir in Indiana
has always been huge.</i>

09:07.490 --> 09:09.970
<i>Next to basketball,
its combination of singing</i>

09:10.005 --> 09:12.005
<i>and Broadway-caliber
choreography</i>

09:12.236 --> 09:14.573
<i>is the most cutthroat
competition around.</i>

09:16.180 --> 09:17.835
<i>I didn't want
to see her get hurt,</i>

09:18.244 --> 09:20.685
<i>but then I looked
at her young and shiny face</i>

09:20.720 --> 09:23.497
<i>not beaten down yet
by busted dryers</i>

09:23.532 --> 09:25.725
<i>and mean bosses
with guns...</i>

09:25.820 --> 09:27.460
- Go for it.
- Hmm?

09:27.935 --> 09:30.321
- You really--you really think so?
- <i>No.</i>

09:31.280 --> 09:32.378
Dad?

09:36.620 --> 09:39.274
This could be
your year.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.306
Okay! Cool.

09:42.890 --> 09:44.589
<i>We are so screwed.</i>

09:45.390 --> 09:49.004
Brick is a very
quirky child...

09:49.433 --> 09:51.941
Maybe clinically quirky, even.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.118
We have no idea
what you mean.

09:54.190 --> 09:56.442
<i>We knew exactly
what she meant.</i>

10:01.250 --> 10:04.820
Happy birthday to you!

10:05.170 --> 10:07.747
Mrs. Rettig, Mrs. Rettig,
I want to tell you

10:07.782 --> 10:09.850
something funny
I did the other day.

10:10.450 --> 10:11.966
Well, that may be because

10:12.001 --> 10:14.737
you haven't spent much time
here in the classroom.

10:14.760 --> 10:15.693
Are we supposed to?

10:16.040 --> 10:17.749
I mean, isn't that
the point of school--

10:17.920 --> 10:20.418
That between 8:00 and 3:00,
he's your problem?

10:20.660 --> 10:22.674
If he, you know, eats
his napkin at dinner,

10:22.709 --> 10:24.540
we don't call you and ask you
to come over to our house.

10:24.575 --> 10:27.781
Look, I would love to spend
more time here, but I work.

10:27.970 --> 10:29.617
I'm at work right now.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.395
Brick's a very bright boy,

10:34.430 --> 10:38.770
but we feel he could benefit from
a series of more formal tests--

10:38.820 --> 10:41.123
Okay, look,
Brick isn't your typical kid,

10:41.163 --> 10:45.260
but he is funny and sweet
and probably a genius.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.500
Okay, so he doesn't fit into
your cookie-cutter mold.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.900
But that doesn't mean
that he needs fixing.

10:49.960 --> 10:53.910
Our oldest son had a completely
pointed head until he was six.

10:53.911 --> 10:55.158
Like a candy corn.

10:55.210 --> 10:56.659
And so what,
we got some funny looks

10:56.694 --> 10:57.812
when we took him
to the mall?

10:57.920 --> 10:59.090
You know
what we did about it?

10:59.350 --> 11:00.237
Nothing.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.510
And eventually, it just
flattened out all on its own.

11:02.511 --> 11:04.033
I think what we're trying
to say here is,

11:04.068 --> 11:05.020
thanks for your concern,

11:05.110 --> 11:08.050
but our Brick doesn't need
any special anything.

11:08.110 --> 11:09.610
- He's fine.
- Mm-hmm.

11:09.950 --> 11:11.666
His best friend
is his backpack.

11:14.950 --> 11:17.149
I just hope he's weird enough
that our insurance covers it.

11:19.140 --> 11:22.213
How happy are you
with your car?

11:24.680 --> 11:26.952
<i>First a busted dryer,
now a busted kid.</i>

11:27.210 --> 11:29.370
<i>I needed to sell a car now
more than ever.</i>

11:29.420 --> 11:31.418
<i>And if Ehlert caught me
sneaking in and out,</i>

11:31.419 --> 11:33.455
<i>he'd nail my keister
to his wall.</i>

11:34.410 --> 11:36.890
Mr. Ehlert was looking
for you, Frankie.

11:36.950 --> 11:37.647
Where you been?

11:38.290 --> 11:40.053
Here.
Right here.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.540
Just, uh, working
with this fine woman

11:44.575 --> 11:47.121
who's interested
in this fine car.

11:47.330 --> 11:49.117
Actually, I am interested
in this car.

11:49.340 --> 11:50.446
Get outta town.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.668
But I was just wondering
if a convertible is too wild for me.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.250
Are you kidding me?

11:55.420 --> 11:59.463
Wild on the outside,
but dependable on the inside.

11:59.560 --> 12:00.320
Yeah, you know what?

12:00.420 --> 12:04.891
- I consider myself a matchmaker--
- <i>Frankie, call on line one.</i>

12:05.030 --> 12:07.500
- For people and vehicles...
- <i>It's your husband.</i>

12:08.290 --> 12:10.453
And you look like
the type of person--

12:10.488 --> 12:11.998
<i>He sounds pretty mad.</i>

12:12.490 --> 12:13.735
<i>He's at Axl's school.</i>

12:13.770 --> 12:16.604
<i>He needs you to go back
and pick up Brick.</i>

12:16.680 --> 12:18.080
Oh, come on!

12:18.120 --> 12:20.480
No, he is supposed
to pick up Brick!

12:20.510 --> 12:22.533
Axl is at football
until 5:00!

12:22.568 --> 12:25.710
Tell him to read
his damn thermos!

12:25.750 --> 12:27.820
Oh, look, look, I can always
come back another day.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.940
- No!
- No, I'm a mom, too.

12:30.020 --> 12:31.458
I know what it's like.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.325
<i>All sales personnel,
the doughnuts are here.</i>

12:38.420 --> 12:40.046
Now you're suspended
for three games?

12:40.060 --> 12:41.550
What the hell is
the matter with you?

12:41.551 --> 12:42.122
What did he do?

12:42.172 --> 12:43.810
He called his football coach
a moron.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.160
You always call him
a moron.

12:45.190 --> 12:46.864
He called for a bomb
on 4th and 1.

12:47.090 --> 12:48.691
You think you're some
sort of a big shot

12:48.726 --> 12:49.955
just 'cause
you play ball?

12:50.090 --> 12:52.320
Well, the smart-mouth
attitude goes today.

12:52.360 --> 12:52.930
Whatever.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.395
That's it!
Go to your room.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.751
No, wait. You like your room.
Go to Sue's room!

12:58.500 --> 12:59.405
Moron.

13:00.220 --> 13:01.020
Damn it.

13:01.055 --> 13:04.009
If only he had, like,
a car or a TV or a cell phone--

13:04.044 --> 13:05.580
something good we could
take away from him.

13:05.615 --> 13:08.519
- I know.
- Mom, you're my hero.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.125
That's nice, honey,
but we're trying to think up

13:10.126 --> 13:11.550
a good punishment
for your brother.

13:11.610 --> 13:13.409
You'll need a costume.

13:14.020 --> 13:16.630
- Costume.
- Huh?

13:16.770 --> 13:18.770
I'm doinga book report
on Superwoman.

13:18.830 --> 13:20.848
You have to come dress
like her Monday

13:20.939 --> 13:23.050
so I can show and tell you
as part of my project.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.321
You can also come
as Jungle Girl,

13:25.356 --> 13:26.541
but I'd have
to do it today.

13:26.640 --> 13:30.140
Damn it, Brick, you've gotta
tell me these things earlier.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.005
I did!

13:31.035 --> 13:33.360
I've been telling you
all week you're my hero.

13:33.430 --> 13:35.069
Didn't you listen?

13:35.400 --> 13:36.553
Whatever!

13:36.670 --> 13:38.795
Honey, okay, listen.
I'm sorry.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.090
- Honey, come back here.
- Oh, let him be.

13:41.950 --> 13:43.990
What is happening?

13:44.190 --> 13:47.240
I used to think I was
a pretty good mom, and now...

13:47.275 --> 13:48.880
God, I really--
I don't know.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.866
Hey, come on.
You're a great mom.

13:51.680 --> 13:55.533
So Brick is weird, and
Sue has no recognizable talent,

13:55.568 --> 13:58.734
and Axl's flushing his future
down the toilet.

13:59.150 --> 14:00.670
- All kids are screwed up.
- Yeah,

14:00.705 --> 14:02.630
not the Donahues
across the street.

14:02.640 --> 14:03.915
No. Those kids are awesome.

14:03.985 --> 14:04.929
I know.

14:07.030 --> 14:09.071
I did it.
I made show choir!

14:10.060 --> 14:11.740
- You did?
- Yeah!

14:11.910 --> 14:12.743
You sure, honey?

14:12.778 --> 14:14.680
Is it actually
written down somewhere?

14:14.730 --> 14:15.603
Yes, yes!

14:15.634 --> 14:17.259
And they already
rotated me in,

14:17.298 --> 14:19.020
so I gotta learn everything
super quick

14:19.055 --> 14:20.919
for our first competition
this Friday.

14:20.954 --> 14:22.797
Oh, my God!

14:23.502 --> 14:24.600
This is huge!

14:24.830 --> 14:26.345
Oh, honey, that's great!

14:26.380 --> 14:28.030
I'm so proud of you.

14:28.540 --> 14:29.610
Thanks, Dad.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.712
All right, well, I'd better
get my homework done,

14:31.746 --> 14:34.396
because I am going
to be so busy.

14:39.150 --> 14:41.082
<i>Either Sue does have
some talent,</i>

14:41.260 --> 14:43.529
<i>or we have one
crappy show choir.</i>

14:44.010 --> 14:45.919
<i>This called
for a celebration.</i>

14:47.270 --> 14:48.960
Sue, I'm just
so proud of you.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.098
I never thought
you'd make anything.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.186
Here's a dollar.

14:55.450 --> 14:56.754
Thank you!

14:57.400 --> 14:59.220
Hey, come on,
everybody!

14:59.390 --> 15:00.470
It's getting kind of cold.

15:00.530 --> 15:03.434
We should all get inside
and eat together as a family.

15:03.660 --> 15:06.260
Move that bus!

15:06.590 --> 15:09.070
Oh, my.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.080
<i>And now,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

15:12.229 --> 15:15.465
<i>fresh from
their knockout performance</i>

15:15.500 --> 15:19.269
<i>at Hoosier Village Assisted
Living in Terre Haute...</i>

15:20.180 --> 15:24.392
The Orson Swingsations!

15:28.633 --> 15:31.594
[ SONG: Get This Party Started
ARTIST: Pink ]

15:50.120 --> 15:54.910
- Do you see Sue?
- No.

15:54.945 --> 15:55.895
Where the hell is she?

16:02.310 --> 16:03.660
She's on the crew.

16:04.250 --> 16:04.871
What?

16:05.360 --> 16:06.270
Oh, that's great!

16:06.305 --> 16:07.550
The only thing lamer
than show choir

16:07.600 --> 16:09.236
is being on the crew
for show choir.

16:10.350 --> 16:11.544
Where's Sue?

16:11.560 --> 16:15.041
She's in the--the middlish row
behind the pregnant girl.

16:17.350 --> 16:19.670
Why didn't she tell us
she was only on the crew?

16:19.705 --> 16:20.370
I don't know.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.309
She does look
real happy, though.

16:32.730 --> 16:35.530
That's my daughter--
That's my daughter right there.

16:35.565 --> 16:36.726
Go, Sue!

16:48.420 --> 16:49.925
One more.
One more.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.090
Sue, the box.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.145
The box.

17:48.620 --> 17:50.728
<i>No wonder my face
looks the way it does.</i>

17:50.920 --> 17:53.907
<i>The Swingsation disaster
got Sue kicked off crew.</i>

17:55.340 --> 17:57.860
<i>So when Brick said it was
the day of his book report...</i>

17:57.920 --> 17:59.688
Today's the day
of my book report.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.882
<i>I was at the end of my rope.
But what could I do?</i>

18:04.410 --> 18:08.049
<i>I was the no-show mom whose kid's
best friend was his backpack.</i>

18:09.240 --> 18:11.331
<i>I put on
my spanx and went.</i>

18:18.720 --> 18:21.550
Anybody call for Superwoman?

18:25.591 --> 18:27.643
That's next Monday.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.667
Okay, okay, come on.
Back to the story.

18:37.830 --> 18:38.592
Hi, Bob.

18:38.860 --> 18:40.567
Frankie.
Yeah, it's me, Bob.

18:40.650 --> 18:42.498
<i>Listen, that Gail woman--
She came back</i>

18:42.533 --> 18:43.484
to purchase a car.

18:43.770 --> 18:44.928
She's looking for you.

18:45.330 --> 18:46.064
<i>But that dummy Pete--</i>

18:46.113 --> 18:47.083
He's moving in
for the kill.

18:47.123 --> 18:48.552
He's plying her
with snow cones.

18:48.630 --> 18:49.750
<i>I don't think she can
hold out much longer.</i>

18:49.785 --> 18:50.894
She's on her second grape.

18:50.895 --> 18:52.890
No, no!
That is my customer!

18:52.940 --> 18:55.784
Listen, don't let her move.
I'm gonna be right there, okay?

19:00.570 --> 19:01.324
Damn it.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.460
And the braking system
is just, like, so great.

19:04.550 --> 19:07.711
Because it, you know,
like, it stops really well,

19:07.712 --> 19:12.696
and it's got this, I mean,
integrated steering wheel that--

19:12.731 --> 19:14.803
that, like, you know,
you turn it,

19:14.896 --> 19:17.060
and--and honk if
people get in the way,

19:17.120 --> 19:19.656
- and it just--
- Frankie, are you okay?

19:19.920 --> 19:21.760
You seem
a little... stressed.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.832
Oh, no. I'm fine.
I'm perfect.

19:23.920 --> 19:24.633
Uh, where was I?

19:24.683 --> 19:27.850
Oh, the horn!
You're going to <i>love</i> the horn.

19:27.930 --> 19:28.753
Listen to this.

19:31.130 --> 19:33.400
Isn't that great?
I am a matchmaker.

19:33.460 --> 19:36.400
Did I mention that?
For people and, um, wait.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.210
See? Isn't that fabulous?

19:39.250 --> 19:41.201
You know,
I'm a mom, too.

19:42.020 --> 19:44.291
I know what it's like
to balance work and kids.

19:44.432 --> 19:45.491
I've got three.

19:47.390 --> 19:48.741
I've got three, too.

19:49.140 --> 19:50.239
Isn't it hard?

19:51.880 --> 19:53.309
It's really hard.

19:55.090 --> 19:59.569
I'm just stretched so thin.
I feel like I can't do anything right.

19:59.604 --> 20:00.421
Oh, I know.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.631
Some days, I swear I just feel
like getting in the car

20:03.783 --> 20:06.070
- and driving and driving...
- Yeah.

20:06.105 --> 20:07.773
And never coming back.

20:08.590 --> 20:09.649
Do you ever feel like that?

20:09.740 --> 20:11.680
Only every day!

20:20.250 --> 20:22.260
We made it! Yeah!

20:22.410 --> 20:24.650
Pedal to the metal,
baby, all the way!

20:29.030 --> 20:29.909
What was that?

20:31.130 --> 20:31.925
What was what?

20:32.500 --> 20:33.952
I think
we hit something.

20:34.460 --> 20:35.520
Is something wrong
with the car?

20:35.555 --> 20:36.794
Maybe you'd better check.

20:36.940 --> 20:38.513
No, I'm sure it's fine.

20:38.730 --> 20:41.350
I--no--yeah, no, no.
I'll check. Okay. Okay.

20:42.940 --> 20:45.110
Yeah, I don't see anything.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.192
Hey!

20:48.227 --> 20:51.455
Sorry! I got
three kids in jail!

20:51.650 --> 20:52.940
What?
No, wait!

20:52.975 --> 20:55.077
You're not gonna
get away with this!

20:55.260 --> 20:58.018
I've got your license
back at the office!

21:00.190 --> 21:02.600
Oh, I bet that's not even
her real license.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.433
Yeah, the picture
was too good.

21:38.780 --> 21:40.067
Somebody call
for a ride?

21:42.660 --> 21:43.341
Rough day?

21:46.240 --> 21:47.893
<i>That's the thing
about family.</i>

21:48.110 --> 21:50.338
<i>Oh sure, they eat your food
and wreck your face,</i>

21:50.378 --> 21:52.323
<i>you gotta save them
a thousand times a day,</i>

21:52.343 --> 21:53.661
<i>for God knows what.</i>

21:54.120 --> 21:56.873
<i>But every now and then,
they save you.</i>

22:12.100 --> 22:13.726
Not pretty fast
for a superhero.

22:15.310 --> 22:17.248
- Are you okay?
- Wow! Nice tights.

22:17.460 --> 22:18.905
Look at you.
Look at your mom.

22:19.660 --> 22:20.265
Mom...

22:20.667 --> 22:22.401
Here with your dinner.
We made it.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.064
You make it
just like I do.

22:31.910 --> 22:33.534
I love you, guys,
you know.

22:33.569 --> 22:34.508
We know, Mom.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.730
Hi. How come you never tell me
you love me?

22:40.820 --> 22:42.627
I told you I loved you
the day I married you.

22:43.340 --> 22:45.084
If anything had changed,
I'd let you know.

22:47.110 --> 22:49.879
<i>So, yeah...
Back then on the old license,</i>

22:49.948 --> 22:52.029
<i>you know what my life
was gonna be.</i>

22:52.370 --> 22:53.407
<i>And Mike's right.</i>

22:53.990 --> 22:56.689
<i>And I know...
this is my life.</i>

22:57.010 --> 22:59.102
<i>It's not gonna be
in People magazine or anything,</i>

22:59.151 --> 23:00.273
<i>but you know what?</i>

23:00.590 --> 23:02.114
<i>I got it good.</i>

23:03.208 --> 23:05.875
You have a meeting
with my gym teacher on Friday.

23:06.030 --> 23:07.926
- Friday.
- Knock it off, freak.

23:07.961 --> 23:09.047

23:10.999 --> 23:12.546
