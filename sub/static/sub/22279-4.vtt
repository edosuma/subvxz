NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero...

00:14.133 --> 00:16.500
ANDY: It's a whole different
ball game in the summertime.

00:16.533 --> 00:19.567

Unpredictable weather is
shaking up life in Alaska.

00:21.433 --> 00:22.967

things is right now.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
NARRATOR: A lesson
in survival cuts deep.

00:25.033 --> 00:26.067
CHIP: Ow.

00:26.833 --> 00:28.400
ANDY: Let's go!

00:28.433 --> 00:29.933

Andy and Kate put their
youngest dogs to the test.

to find food brings her
to unfamiliar waters.

(SUE SCREAMS)

00:59.100 --> 01:00.367
NARRATOR:
For Sue Aikens,

01:00.400 --> 01:02.067
summer is the time
to gather food

01:02.100 --> 01:03.867
to survive the winter months.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.133
But the absence
of caribou in Kavik,

01:09.167 --> 01:11.367
has forced her to seek out
other options.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.867
SUE: The fishing trip
is looking, uh, more like
a hunting trip right now.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.567
I don't know, I've seen,
maybe, 10 caribou.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.433
You got a little mum
and baby sleeping
right underneath the ball

01:21.467 --> 01:23.100
that I'm gonna sleep in.

01:23.133 --> 01:24.767
There are rules that govern.

01:24.800 --> 01:28.500
Flying and hunting
on the same day is a no-no.
That's an unfair advantage.

01:28.533 --> 01:32.433
So I have to wait until,
you know, tomorrow morning
in the wee hours

01:32.467 --> 01:34.367
before I can
actually pull the trigger.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.167
I've heard about this
fishing hole for a long time,
I wanna try it out,

01:38.200 --> 01:41.233
and it just worked out there's
some caribou here, too.

01:41.267 --> 01:45.033
My little cubby
for the next couple days.

01:45.067 --> 01:48.833
The DEW Line days,
the early warning detection
system during the Cold War.

01:48.867 --> 01:50.733
Big radar golf balls.

01:50.767 --> 01:52.600
The last of
the remaining sites

01:52.633 --> 01:54.500
on the north shore of Alaska
are disappearing.

01:54.533 --> 01:57.700
They've all been
decommissioned,
no longer military property.

01:57.733 --> 01:59.600
They're tearing everything
out and getting rid of it.

02:01.233 --> 02:02.600
This is pretty cool.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.800
There is supposedly, like,

02:05.833 --> 02:10.733
the north slope's coolest
Arctic char fishing hole.

02:10.767 --> 02:13.767
And I want, you know,
I keep hearing everybody talk
about it over the years,

02:13.800 --> 02:15.033
but I haven't been
able to get here.

02:15.067 --> 02:16.367
Well, now I did.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.767
So that's the main focus,
but coming in,

02:18.800 --> 02:21.233
the caribou are just
kinda running around.

02:21.267 --> 02:24.467
You know, I have
to wait until 3:00 a.m.
to pull the trigger.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.833
So as far as I'm concerned,
it gives me
a little bit of time,

02:26.867 --> 02:28.933
I can make
my little cubby nice.

02:28.967 --> 02:31.333
I can get a little cup of tea
or something going.

02:31.367 --> 02:34.033
I'll go ahead and, uh,
work on my fishing

02:34.067 --> 02:36.033
while I'm waiting
on my hunting.

02:36.067 --> 02:39.067
Working on my hunting
while I'm waiting
on my fishing.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.900
Kinda spoiled for choice
right now.

02:42.533 --> 02:45.000
CHIP: If you want something,
especially up here,

02:45.033 --> 02:46.767
you either make it yourself,
or you just do without.

02:58.433 --> 03:00.000
We're going downriver.

03:00.033 --> 03:01.700
We're going towards the ocean,

03:01.733 --> 03:03.533
to a place where
there's lots of islands

03:03.567 --> 03:05.867
where the seagulls
like to lay their eggs.

03:05.900 --> 03:08.900
We're trying to see
if there are seagulls
sitting on their nests.

03:08.933 --> 03:11.567
And now is the time
to keep a close watch.

03:11.600 --> 03:15.267
So that's what we're doing
and today's our first check.

03:15.300 --> 03:18.333
We can pick the eggs
from them for, like,
three days in a row

03:18.367 --> 03:21.833
and stop,
and they'll still have babies.

03:21.867 --> 03:26.167
NARRATOR: For the Hailstones,
breakup of the river
leads to a spring harvest

03:26.200 --> 03:29.900

CHIP: I wanna show my kids
where to go get these eggs.

03:40.533 --> 03:42.967
I want them to have
the knowledge
of where and when.

03:45.033 --> 03:46.567
This is the time to do it.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.700
This is the place to do it.

03:55.367 --> 03:58.367
We're in a place where
there's lots of mud, it's easy
to lose your boots here.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.633
This is deep mud.

04:02.067 --> 04:06.267
This island is full of
all kinds of crazy little ways
to get stuck.

04:08.700 --> 04:12.767
It's got long deals to it,
I want you guys to pair up.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.467
-Who's gonna stay together?
-Me and Carol.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.967
CHIP: Okay, that sounds good,
as long as you guys
got a partner.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.633
If we don't pair 'em up,
you know, they can
lose their boots,

04:21.667 --> 04:23.400
they can fall in
the water and get icy.

04:23.433 --> 04:27.200
And plus, too, it's real easy
when you have a system of
two people trying to get eggs.

04:27.233 --> 04:29.867
My younger kids haven't done
this very much.

04:29.900 --> 04:32.233
My older kids know this place
very well.

04:32.267 --> 04:33.467
CAROL: Oh, look!

04:35.233 --> 04:37.167
Nope, that's not a nest.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.800
These are tidal flats,
and after the flood
has passed,

04:39.833 --> 04:42.700
as you can see from this mud,
the water's been
over top of it.

04:42.733 --> 04:44.800
Then they come and lay
their eggs as soon
as the flood goes down.

04:44.833 --> 04:48.067
Flood's gone down, hopefully
the smelts are coming in,

04:48.100 --> 04:51.633
cause they gorge themselves
on the small fish,
and right after that,

04:51.667 --> 04:53.367
they'll go and they'll nest.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.267
They'll be munching down
and making eggs.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.533
It's like a little maze,
you have to go and search, um,
for little islands and stuff.

05:04.867 --> 05:07.100
It's always fun for the kids,
it's like Easter.

05:29.233 --> 05:31.067
AGNES: Another nest?

05:31.100 --> 05:32.667
They look similar like that.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.500
That looks like one
that's gonna be made soon,
but not quite yet.

05:41.367 --> 05:42.567
CHIP:
This one's been worked on.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.800
See how wet it is
from their feet?

05:44.833 --> 05:47.033
Where they're sitting,
see how they carve this out?

05:47.067 --> 05:49.133
They got rid of the debris.

05:49.167 --> 05:52.267
As soon as they're ready
to lay eggs,
we'll start to see feathers.

05:52.300 --> 05:55.233
A few feathers
smashed in there
and then they'll lay the eggs.

05:55.267 --> 05:58.067
So from indications,
is that they're getting ready,
but they're not here yet.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.633
They're getting ready to lay.
Could be tomorrow.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.500
Only fresh nests.
I see they're working
on their nests.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.333
AGNES: Yeah, we've seen
a few nests, too.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.067
There's quite a few
nests that aren't worked on

06:10.100 --> 06:13.500
and there's about maybe,
I've seen five or six
that were worked on.

06:13.533 --> 06:14.900
No feathers in them yet,
though?

06:14.933 --> 06:17.100
No feathers in them, nope.
So I would say maybe a day.

06:21.733 --> 06:23.733
As long as we're here early,
we're happy.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.767
When we get back down here,
they'll be fresh.

06:26.633 --> 06:27.700
This will be awesome.

06:35.367 --> 06:37.667
ANDY:
Even the most confident person
and knowledgeable person

06:37.700 --> 06:40.200
is gonna get their butt
kicked from time to time,

06:40.233 --> 06:41.933
but as long
as it doesn't kill you,

06:41.967 --> 06:43.800
it's a good
learning experience.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.733
I think I'm gonna take
some dogs out and run them,

06:53.767 --> 06:55.633
get a few of these guys
used to boats.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.733
I try and use my dogs
all year long.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.000
They're not just sled dogs.

06:59.033 --> 07:01.067
They have to know
how to get into boats.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.300
When they're in boats,
they have to behave.

07:03.333 --> 07:06.533
Because if I get
15 or 20 dogs in a boat

07:06.567 --> 07:10.500
and they're not behaving,
it's pretty chaotic and pretty
dangerous for everybody.

07:11.533 --> 07:13.067
KATE: During the flood of 09',

07:13.100 --> 07:14.467
having all these
little extra skills

07:14.500 --> 07:16.333
really made a big difference.

07:16.367 --> 07:18.200
They had to get
tied into boats

07:18.233 --> 07:21.833
after they'd all been
scared out of their wits
floating around in water.

07:21.867 --> 07:26.567
Getting into boats,
getting into canoes,
getting into a helicopter,

07:26.600 --> 07:30.067
arriving in Eagle,
having a stranger
take them in a truck.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.133
They handled it beautifully,
and that is good training.

07:33.167 --> 07:34.200

07:36.967 --> 07:38.967
Oh, man, you're strong.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.333
Oh, crap!

07:40.367 --> 07:42.533
Our summers
are four months long,

07:42.567 --> 07:44.900
four months to do
all the work we need to do.

In the boat! Good boy!

07:53.967 --> 07:58.733
These dogs were rescued
from our property in 2009,
by canoe.

07:58.767 --> 08:00.167
So that really
brought home to me

08:00.200 --> 08:03.500
the importance of not
only teaching a dog
to be a sled dog,

08:03.533 --> 08:05.433
but to be a really
well-rounded dog,

08:05.467 --> 08:07.300
to be exposed to a lot
of different things

08:07.333 --> 08:09.767
and have a lot
of different capabilities.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.833
It's my job in the summertime
now to get out there,

08:12.867 --> 08:16.700
expose the dog to what
I expect them to do,
give them that experience,

08:16.733 --> 08:20.300
give them that confidence
so that when I decide
to go out and do something,

08:20.333 --> 08:22.200
it goes like clockwork.

08:22.233 --> 08:24.000
Let's go for a run!

08:24.033 --> 08:25.367
Let's go for a run!

08:34.200 --> 08:36.267
GLENN: It's very exciting
living out here.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.933
I mean,
it's so much more complex

08:38.967 --> 08:41.967
and more intellectually
challenging and
physically challenging

08:42.000 --> 08:43.433
than if I were just to go
buy my food.

09:00.733 --> 09:03.333
That heat feels nice.
A lot of times
when I stoke the fire,

09:03.367 --> 09:07.100
I like to just stand
by the stove
and just enjoy the warmth.

09:07.133 --> 09:09.633
I would like to take a sauna,
that would feel great.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.467
When it's cold,
the end of the day,

09:11.500 --> 09:13.400
your muscles are sore
just to get in there.

09:13.433 --> 09:16.133
Maybe I can build
a little sweat lodge.

09:16.167 --> 09:18.800
Maybe I can make something
like the shape of a tepee.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.567
Or maybe a little dome.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.033
Just cover it with a tarp,
put a wood stove in it.

09:24.067 --> 09:26.133
But I've never
built a dome before.

09:26.167 --> 09:27.700
I'm not sure
how that would work out.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.200
It would be an experiment.
I would have to try.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.467
The goal is
to contain the heat.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.300
If I make it small enough
and it's tightly enough built,

09:37.333 --> 09:41.133
then that it will get it
really hot in there
so I work up a good sweat.

09:41.167 --> 09:44.067
This looks like
a pretty good spot.
It's level.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.433
It's pretty close to the lake.

09:45.467 --> 09:47.400
I just have to be able
to sit in it

09:47.433 --> 09:49.400
and have a wood stove
in there with me.

09:51.833 --> 09:54.267
If I was sitting right here
and I had a stove here...

09:57.700 --> 09:59.033

10:00.533 --> 10:01.933
That would be nice.

10:01.967 --> 10:04.700

for some poles to start
building it right here.

of miles away from

See, a tree about this
big around, I can bend it,

10:14.000 --> 10:19.400
then if I bent another one
down and tied them together,
I'd have an arch.

10:19.433 --> 10:20.533
That might work.

10:26.700 --> 10:30.967
This is the thing about
a sweat lodge, it's more
than just physical.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.833
It's gonna be good
for the consciousness, too.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.600
It's a whole different
atmosphere in there.

10:39.367 --> 10:41.200
I am gonna have to clean
these up really well

10:41.233 --> 10:45.100
because any little thing
like this, that's gonna stick
right through my tarp.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.933
I gotta take off
all the little sharp nubs.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.267

they're real enjoyable.

in about 10 days.

he's going back
into the woods,

12:02.167 --> 12:03.500
but the caribou got separated.

12:03.533 --> 12:05.433
Is the other caribou
still in the woods?

12:07.800 --> 12:10.200
You don't usually see
caribou down here
this late in spring.

12:11.967 --> 12:13.167
I don't need caribou now,

12:13.200 --> 12:16.467
but it's pretty interesting
to see them.

12:16.500 --> 12:20.733
If that calf made it,
it's gonna go back
to its mother, eventually.

12:23.967 --> 12:25.833
Caribou can generally
outrun a wolf

12:25.867 --> 12:28.000
as long as they get
a little head start.

12:28.033 --> 12:30.300
I can't imagine anything
more interesting to do

12:30.333 --> 12:33.600
than watch life like this
taking place.

12:33.633 --> 12:35.133
You never know
what's gonna happen.

12:35.167 --> 12:37.367
That's what's so exciting
about living this way,
it's that...

12:37.400 --> 12:39.867
I'll be doing one thing,
like building
a little sweat lodge,

12:39.900 --> 12:41.433
and the next thing you know,

12:41.467 --> 12:44.367
there's caribou
getting chased by wolves
right here in my front yard.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.567
ANDY:
It's constant planning here
and it's not for next week,

12:50.600 --> 12:51.900
it's for next year.

12:51.933 --> 12:54.067
That's really important
when you live this way.

13:07.733 --> 13:09.733
We got a boat full of dogs
and we're here,

13:09.767 --> 13:11.767
getting ready to take
the dogs for a run

13:11.800 --> 13:14.733
on the islands across
from my place.

13:14.767 --> 13:16.233
It's really important
to keep these dogs

13:16.267 --> 13:17.967
in shape all summer long

13:18.000 --> 13:19.900
so that they're ready
to go in the fall time.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.267
The more they know,
the better.

13:22.300 --> 13:25.867
I want them to be
as experienced in as many
different things as I can.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.633
'Cause you just never know
what's gonna happen.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.867
Okay, out of the boat. Go on.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.667
Good boy. Go, Tope, go, Tope.

13:32.700 --> 13:36.600
Getting in and out of boats
is really a skill
they have to know.

13:36.633 --> 13:38.500
It has to be
not unquestionable.

13:38.533 --> 13:40.200
When the flood hit us,

13:40.233 --> 13:43.300
the only way we were able
to evacuate our dogs
was to put them into a canoe.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.867
Had my dogs not been
able to ride in a canoe,

13:45.900 --> 13:48.333
that wouldn't have
even been an option.

13:48.367 --> 13:50.367
Straight ahead, let's go.
Come, come, come.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.933
These dogs work really hard
all winter long,

13:53.967 --> 13:56.000
and this is, kind of,
playtime for them,

13:56.033 --> 13:57.833
but it's also educational
for them.

13:58.600 --> 13:59.900
It's just about exposure.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.833
Lots of experiences.
Experience is knowledge,

14:03.867 --> 14:05.567
whether you're human
or animal.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.200
Everything we do
with the dogs is giving them

14:09.233 --> 14:11.000
as many experiences as we can.

14:12.367 --> 14:14.733
The other thing I like to do
is I like to watch the dogs,

14:14.767 --> 14:17.333
and see which ones
are running up front.

14:17.367 --> 14:18.667
Those are potential leaders.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.967
Right now I've got Topaz
running up front with Jack.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.233
Jack and Topaz, so far,
are doing really good.

14:27.267 --> 14:31.467
You know, I really spend
a lot of time doing discipline
training with the dogs.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.867
I want them to be as
experienced in as many
different things as I can.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.500
Not just sled dogs,

14:36.533 --> 14:38.933
they're guard dogs,
they're work dogs,

14:38.967 --> 14:41.467
they're pack dogs,
they do everything.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.033
Come, come. Everybody come.
Everybody come.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.567
Two reasons
why I'm doing this.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.900
One is just to get
the dogs out,
muscle them up a little bit.

14:48.933 --> 14:50.433
But probably more importantly,

14:50.467 --> 14:53.633
it's being confident
in whenever I tell them to do
something, they do it.

14:54.300 --> 14:55.367
Let's go home.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.067
Atta boy. Good boy, Jack.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.200
Everybody in. Come on, Coug.

15:01.933 --> 15:05.067
Jack, you did a good job.
You're a boat dog now, Jack.

15:11.767 --> 15:13.733
SUE:
Just 'cause I haven't done,
it doesn't mean squat.

15:13.767 --> 15:15.933
It's something
I'm going to do.

15:15.967 --> 15:17.100
It's not things
I haven't done.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.633
It's things
I haven't done yet.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.400
NARRATOR: An unseasonably late
caribou migration in Kavik

15:29.433 --> 15:33.633
has forced Sue 34 miles
to the coast
in search of food.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.233
SUE: Yesterday,
Jake brought me in,

15:35.267 --> 15:38.700
there were a few caribou
running around,
but I can't pull the trigger.

15:38.733 --> 15:40.800
You can't fly and hunt
on the same day.

15:40.833 --> 15:43.267
And I'm just getting ready.
I'm making some coffee.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.600
And I'm gonna go out and see

15:44.633 --> 15:46.133
if I can spook
one of them up.

15:46.167 --> 15:51.067
I mean, I've never had a year
where I only see
six to 12 caribou

15:51.100 --> 15:52.733
from May until now.

15:52.767 --> 15:55.333
I mean, we're right before
the migration.

15:55.367 --> 15:59.100
The worry is still there
that if they don't migrate
through my area,

15:59.133 --> 16:01.167
within five, ten
miles of my area,

16:01.200 --> 16:03.967
that's, kind of,
a game changer for me
for the winter.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.033
Time to go and see
who's out there.

16:10.033 --> 16:16.033
So I brought my stick,
the gun, got my net.

16:16.067 --> 16:20.767
And I'm just gonna kinda
go prepared for anything
that might happen.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.567
I need to get something
so I survive the winter.

16:27.967 --> 16:29.200
(SOFTLY) There it is.

16:30.767 --> 16:34.367
I can try to put the sneak
on these up here.

16:36.267 --> 16:38.500
I'm gonna leave my pack
and my pole here.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.100
There is one, there is two.
Where's the baby?

16:48.767 --> 16:51.200
I have to verify
that there's no calves.

16:51.233 --> 16:55.367
It's an opportunity, but you
don't shoot mums and babies.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.867
You know, there's definitely
three cows,

16:58.900 --> 17:03.433
one's fairly juvenile
without calves,

17:03.467 --> 17:06.733
two cows with calves,
but they're now...
They're all together.

17:06.767 --> 17:10.667
That leaves me one cow
that I got to try
and pick out of all of them.

17:10.700 --> 17:14.667
The amount of effort
it's gonna take to try and
maybe pick out that one cow

17:14.700 --> 17:16.333
is not worth it.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.600
I do not, will not
shoot a cow with a calf,

17:19.633 --> 17:22.133
and it's just too difficult
for me to separate them out,

17:22.167 --> 17:23.967
so on to the next thing.

17:29.167 --> 17:34.733
Well, this is the pond
everybody, 'Yay,'
screams about.

17:36.367 --> 17:40.700
I haven't had the opportunity
to add much fish to my diet,
but I want to.

17:40.733 --> 17:43.133
So this is a good
learning experience.

17:43.167 --> 17:45.667
Take that! I mean it, take it.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.233
Oh, shit.

17:51.467 --> 17:53.400
No, no, no, no, no.

17:59.033 --> 18:00.133
(SCREAMS)

18:04.733 --> 18:09.467
The fish was just a couple
of feet from being dinner
when the line broke.

18:09.500 --> 18:13.567
I have undersized equipment,
and a formidable fault.

18:13.600 --> 18:17.233
I do need to work
the bank as little bit of it
as I've got.

18:18.867 --> 18:21.067
I got to, kind of, try
and wear 'em out.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.700
There he is.
Oh, it's a little bitty guy.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.667
But I got him!
Oh, shit, don't let him go!

18:34.767 --> 18:38.067
You're not the size I wanted,
but he is a fishy.

18:38.767 --> 18:40.967
Yay, I got a fishy!

18:42.667 --> 18:44.400
Come on, come on,
come to mama.

18:50.033 --> 18:51.133
Yeah!

18:52.867 --> 18:54.967
Now that's
a freaking char, man.

18:57.700 --> 19:02.967
I think that you probably
can count on two hands,
maybe three,

19:03.000 --> 19:07.300
the amount of people
that have been to this
location to fish.

19:07.333 --> 19:08.833
Whoa, whoa.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.333
This is a bigger one.

19:11.367 --> 19:15.033
I had heard it was this good.
I had hoped it was this good.

19:15.067 --> 19:16.467
So yeah,
I'm pleasantly surprised.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.567
Oh, no!

19:19.467 --> 19:23.433
Phew. (CHUCKLES)
Almost... Almost got away.

19:23.467 --> 19:26.233
Number 10,
final one for the day.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.467
You know, I had
a pretty good day, uh...

19:31.067 --> 19:32.300
Eventful.

19:32.333 --> 19:36.667
Went, saw some caribou,
tried to get on them,

19:36.700 --> 19:40.967
got on them,
got within shooting range,
turns out to be, uh,

19:41.000 --> 19:43.233
cows and calves
so can't get them.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.467
Found this one.
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.633
Got a little technique down
to get them away
from the current,

19:50.667 --> 19:53.833
lessening the power
of the strike and the fight,

19:53.867 --> 19:57.600
and was able to get them up
here, give them headaches,
and get my limit.

19:58.567 --> 20:00.533
What a beautiful fish.
Thank you, fishy.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.800
What was that?
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
"You're welcome." Okay.

20:09.067 --> 20:11.100
GLENN: It's not just this
place, or this way of life,

20:11.133 --> 20:12.533
that's all interchangeable.

20:13.933 --> 20:15.933
It's what's in your head
that matters.

20:15.967 --> 20:17.400
Consciousness, you know?

20:30.900 --> 20:33.400
NARRATOR: To combat
long days of physical work

20:33.433 --> 20:36.000
and bitter winter temperatures
in the bush,

20:36.033 --> 20:38.267
Glenn Villeneuve
is building a sweat lodge.

20:40.433 --> 20:42.000
I've got the first two here,

20:42.933 --> 20:46.367
and I wanna put two
in the other direction.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.067
I'm just gonna lean
those together.

20:50.667 --> 20:54.000
You use natural materials
out here.
They don't grow straight.

20:54.033 --> 20:56.767
Trees aren't straight,
so why try to make
everything straight.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.133
You don't need it straight.

20:59.167 --> 21:03.633
I can picture sitting in here,
getting a good sweat.

21:03.667 --> 21:06.500
If I wanted to, I could build
a much more elaborate sauna,

21:06.533 --> 21:09.867
but this is, kind of,
a nice way to do it.
Just keep things simple.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.900
If I can spend one day
building a sauna,

21:11.933 --> 21:14.000
why make it more
complicated than that?

21:17.833 --> 21:20.300
I've got several steel barrels
that I store things in,

21:20.333 --> 21:23.000
just to protect my things
from the bears
and from the weather.

21:23.033 --> 21:25.667
This is an extra one.
I'm gonna make it
into a wood stove.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.067
(HAMMERING)

21:32.433 --> 21:33.600
There.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.433
That's where
the wood's gonna go in.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.300
Smoke comes out here,
needs a place for air to go in
on the bottom.

21:50.567 --> 21:53.100
This is a tarp
I'm gonna cover
the sweat lodge with.

21:57.067 --> 22:01.000
Well, so far so good.
Frame hasn't fallen down yet.

22:02.867 --> 22:06.600
Awesome. This looks great.
This looks like
it's going to work.

22:08.300 --> 22:12.033
It's just the right size.
I'm real happy with the way
the frame turned out.

22:12.067 --> 22:14.033
I just have to
secure the canvas,

22:14.067 --> 22:16.100
cover the floor
in spruce bows,

22:16.133 --> 22:18.333
get the wood stove going
in here,

22:18.367 --> 22:20.267
and I'm gonna have
a good sweat in here.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.633
Best thing about the sauna
is the atmosphere.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.700
You could actually live
in something like this.

22:29.733 --> 22:35.267
What it's about for me,
is it's just about meditative,
calm, peaceful living.

22:37.433 --> 22:41.433
Awesome. Got the stove in,
got the spruce bows down.

22:41.467 --> 22:44.567
Can't wait to try it out.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.733
CHIP: Knowing
the proper preparations
makes for a smart person.

22:47.767 --> 22:50.667
And you live long, live good,

22:50.700 --> 22:53.133
and you don't rely on anybody
but yourself.

23:01.567 --> 23:04.633
This is a place
where I do a lot of hunting,
this area.

23:04.667 --> 23:08.400
The birds fly by,
the caribou will come
here to cross.

23:09.167 --> 23:10.800
This is like a natural trap.

23:10.833 --> 23:13.067
And one of the best things
here are the fish
that come through.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.733
Right now, I'm waiting to see
if I can see the little smelts
that are coming along.

23:16.767 --> 23:18.800
Smelts are fish,
real small ones that are thin.

23:18.833 --> 23:21.800
As they mate
and they spawn upriver,

23:21.833 --> 23:23.767
they turn around and go back
immediately after doing it.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.500
But they don't all do it
at the same time.

23:25.533 --> 23:28.467
So they may come in here
packed in a bunch,
real easy to scoop out.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.633
But if we caught them
coming down,

23:29.667 --> 23:31.400
we'd only be getting
two or three at a time.

23:31.433 --> 23:34.333
So we really want to get them
full of eggs as they're
heading up.

23:34.367 --> 23:35.467
(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)

23:35.500 --> 23:36.867
What I'm counting on today

23:36.900 --> 23:39.100
is for the seagulls
to let me know
where the smelts are.

23:39.133 --> 23:40.767
Because as soon as
the seagulls

23:40.800 --> 23:43.167
have fed themselves
very well on smelts,

23:43.200 --> 23:44.533
they're gonna head back,

23:44.567 --> 23:46.867
and they're gonna go nest up
and they're gonna lay eggs.

23:46.900 --> 23:50.100
So we want the smelts, too,
and then we'll go get eggs
from the seagulls.

23:50.133 --> 23:51.867
So, in a round-robin way,

23:51.900 --> 23:55.200
I'm, kind of, trying
to predict when the seagulls
are gonna lay their eggs,

23:55.233 --> 23:57.167
and at the same time,
I don't wanna miss the smelts.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.367
I'm gonna go to these alders.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.967
I'm gonna find a couple
that have some
really nice forks in them,

24:03.000 --> 24:04.667
and I'm gonna make
two dippers.

24:04.700 --> 24:06.167
I'm gonna show the kids
how to make those,

24:06.200 --> 24:08.100
and they can learn
the dip netting.

24:16.133 --> 24:18.400
What you need to do
is you need to bend them
like this,

24:18.433 --> 24:20.300
so that you know
that they're flexible.

24:20.333 --> 24:23.367
Doesn't even have to be
a hoop. It can be like
a more of a square.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.133
It can even be like
shovel-shaped.
It doesn't matter.

24:26.167 --> 24:28.667
We still want to be able
to make something
that we can dip down

24:28.700 --> 24:30.567
and pick up the fish with.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.167
When you get a lot of fish
in there, it weighs a lot.

24:33.200 --> 24:37.600
And you're gonna need
the strength of the hoop
to pull them up.

24:37.633 --> 24:40.433
That's looking good,
and if you add one more,
you can make a good hoop.

24:40.467 --> 24:44.800
We're using natural materials
and we're using them basically
in their natural form.

24:44.833 --> 24:48.367
It's using the stuff
around you to accomplish
comfortable living.

(INHALES SHARPLY)

24:57.000 --> 24:58.333
Ah.

24:58.367 --> 25:02.233
I passed the knife tip across
my finger and sliced it.

25:02.267 --> 25:04.467
It doesn't even hurt,
the knife is so sharp.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.233
I had to double check
to see if I was even cut.

25:07.467 --> 25:09.833
Just don't touch where
the bandage goes on here.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.367
There you go.

25:13.167 --> 25:15.933
Just swiped it
with the tip of my knife.

25:16.967 --> 25:18.300
Okay, we're good.

NARRATOR: Spending the summer
on the Kiwalik River,

25:23.033 --> 25:25.667
hundreds of miles
from any medical services,

25:25.700 --> 25:28.600

only on themselves.

CHIP: Look at all those birds
coming over that hillside.

25:32.967 --> 25:35.600
You girls wanna
go over to the river
and go have a look

25:35.633 --> 25:38.167
and see if you see
any little flashes going by,

25:38.200 --> 25:41.033
or you see what look like
raindrops hitting the water,
with no rain.

25:41.067 --> 25:43.767
Just get to a high bank.
Don't go to the sandbar.
Go to the high bank.

25:45.867 --> 25:50.233
CHIP: Only indicator we really
have right now are birds.
The seagulls will let us know.

25:50.267 --> 25:53.000
They eat those fish,
and they gorge on them
before they lay eggs.

25:53.033 --> 25:54.467
CAROL: Do you see anything?

25:59.267 --> 26:00.467
What do you think?

26:02.833 --> 26:04.967
And then it'll dip
into the smelts

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
and pull them up,
and hopefully dump them.

26:08.033 --> 26:10.000
Back in the water
and do it again.

26:10.033 --> 26:11.233
And when the smelts
have passed by,

26:11.267 --> 26:13.133
we'll zip upriver
with the boat,

26:13.167 --> 26:15.300
get ahead of them,
and do it again.

26:15.333 --> 26:16.467
That sound good to you?

26:16.500 --> 26:17.900
(IRIQTAQ SPEAKING)

26:26.700 --> 26:28.333
CHIP:
We're going downriver here,

26:28.367 --> 26:31.200
and we're gonna have a look
and see if there's smelts
coming up the river.

26:31.233 --> 26:32.433
They take quite a while,

26:32.467 --> 26:35.133
but what we really wanna
do at this evening time
is make sure

26:35.167 --> 26:38.733
that we're not gonna have
the smelts pass us by
in our sleep.

26:38.767 --> 26:40.067
We had a really late freeze up

26:40.100 --> 26:42.167
and we're having
a really early break up,

26:42.200 --> 26:44.667
so we've got, like,
an extra month-and-a-half
of summer added.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.433
Hopefully, the fish
have caught up.

26:46.467 --> 26:50.100
It's time for smelting.
We just don't know
where they are at the moment.

26:54.300 --> 26:55.633
I don't see any smelts!

26:56.567 --> 26:58.000
I think we're gonna
go back home

26:58.033 --> 27:00.067
'cause we're down here
by the mouth,

27:00.100 --> 27:02.033
and the sun's gonna
go down soon.

27:02.067 --> 27:05.700
It's better as it is,
for them not to have shown up
than to have missed them.

27:09.633 --> 27:11.233
ANDY: It's the same old story.

27:11.267 --> 27:15.000
Experience is knowledge.
Knowledge is confidence.
Confidence is a job well done.

27:30.767 --> 27:34.767
Our life along
this, uh, Yukon River
in the wintertime

27:34.800 --> 27:38.500
revolves mainly around dogs
and snow machines.

27:38.533 --> 27:41.933
And in the summer time,
it's all about dogs and boats.

27:41.967 --> 27:44.000
Each dog has a talent.

27:44.033 --> 27:46.867
Often times, some dogs
have multiple talents.

27:46.900 --> 27:49.067
But they all have
a weakness somewhere.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.067
And so it's my job,
as their owner,

27:51.100 --> 27:53.233
to figure out
what their weaknesses are,

27:53.267 --> 27:56.000
and realising that,
when I go to do a job,

27:56.033 --> 27:58.667
I don't ask them
to do something
that they're not good for.

27:58.700 --> 28:05.300
So what I plan on doing, Kate,
I want to take Topaz
and Jack and Cougaran.

28:05.333 --> 28:09.400
We'll put Topaz in lead,
and then Jack and Cougaran
next to each other.

28:09.433 --> 28:11.700
And then we'll let them go,
and just see. I have no idea.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.800
I'm hoping they don't run
all the way back to the lake
with this.

28:13.833 --> 28:15.533
I'm hoping they'll just go
a little ways and stop.

28:15.567 --> 28:17.500
But I have no idea
what they're gonna do.

28:17.533 --> 28:20.033
It's really important
to identify,
at a very young age,

28:20.067 --> 28:22.600
dogs that have potential
leadership quality.

28:22.633 --> 28:26.433
Topaz is probably gonna be
one of my better leaders
in the future,

28:26.467 --> 28:29.000
so now I'm trying to expand
that into summertime.

28:29.033 --> 28:31.533
The other dog that's showing
a lot of potential is Jack.

28:31.567 --> 28:32.667
He's a big dog.

28:32.700 --> 28:35.567
Having a large lead dog
that can break trail

28:35.600 --> 28:38.067
would be a real asset to me
when I'm out trapping.

28:38.100 --> 28:42.600
Okay, tighten up, let's go.
Hip-hip. On by. Whoo-hoo!

28:43.900 --> 28:46.800
The trail that I'm using today
is mainly a winter trail.

28:46.833 --> 28:50.967
In the wintertime,
the water freezes,
smoothes it out a little bit.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.133
We get snow blowing in there,
drifts in it,

28:53.167 --> 28:55.967
and then I can
put in a pretty nice trail.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.500
Uh, it's a whole different
ball game in the summer time,
it's full of ruts, pits.

29:00.533 --> 29:03.167
It's gonna be interesting
to see how they handle it.

29:04.367 --> 29:05.400
Straight ahead.

29:06.033 --> 29:07.467
Whoa!

29:07.500 --> 29:11.067
That was really good,
you guys. Good dogs.

29:11.100 --> 29:13.700
First things first,
the canoe goes in the water.

29:13.733 --> 29:17.633
Topaz gets in the boat,
and we go out for a paddle,
and we see how she does.

29:17.667 --> 29:20.233
No, you've got
to learn how to do this.
Come on. Good.

29:20.267 --> 29:22.233
Right there. Good girl.
Sit. Sit.

29:23.233 --> 29:26.567
Good, sit. Stay, stay.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.467
That's what you want to do.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.933
Good girl.

29:29.967 --> 29:32.067
Looks like Topaz
is doing really well.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.300
She's sitting there.
She's watching the paddle.

29:34.333 --> 29:35.867
You'd think she'd been
in a boat all her life.

29:36.967 --> 29:38.933
You're doing
a good job, Topaz.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.033
Good girl!

29:41.067 --> 29:44.300
I'm pretty impressed.
She was the one
I was worried about the most.

29:44.333 --> 29:47.767
I thought she was so hyper.
I thought for sure that dog
was just gonna go,

29:47.800 --> 29:50.800
"Uh-uh. Not going, got to move
around, got to jump."

29:54.433 --> 29:57.700
Uh-oh. We got a leak.
We've got a pretty good leak.

30:00.533 --> 30:03.400
I've got a geyser coming in.
Why don't you look around
in those packs?

30:03.433 --> 30:05.200
I might have some duct tape
or something, Kate.

30:05.233 --> 30:06.567
We're gonna
have to tape it up.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.333
Kind of looks like
it was a bear tooth,
or bear claw hole.

30:09.367 --> 30:11.500
It's one I missed
when I was patching it.

30:11.533 --> 30:12.833
KATE: Oh, no.

30:13.567 --> 30:15.300
ANDY: I think you did good.

30:15.333 --> 30:16.433
Okay, out.

30:16.467 --> 30:19.667
-KATE: Come on, Topey.
-Good girl. Good girl.

30:23.433 --> 30:25.767
This is what I call
a Navy patch.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.100
One of the things you learn
if you're a seaman in the Navy

30:28.133 --> 30:32.967
is how to fix a hole in a boat
by driving wedges into it.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.433
That was, kind of,
unexpected, but that's
the way it is out here.

30:36.467 --> 30:39.300
You know, you just
got to deal with things
as they come

30:39.333 --> 30:42.367
and figure out what you got to
work with and make it work.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.733
All right, let's try Jacker.
Hey, Jack-Jack.

30:45.767 --> 30:48.633
I think Jack's at,
kind of, a critical time
in his development.

30:48.667 --> 30:51.333
He's going from puppyhood
into adulthood.

30:51.367 --> 30:54.467
Or at least becoming
an older teenager.

30:54.500 --> 30:58.400
We're gonna make Jack
graduate from high school
and move on to college today.

30:58.433 --> 31:00.200
Atta boy. In, in.

31:00.667 --> 31:02.200
Sit. Sit.

31:02.933 --> 31:03.967
(ANDY CHUCKLES)

31:04.000 --> 31:06.233
Nope.

31:06.267 --> 31:10.267
Let's get him back in.
You stand on the dock
so he can't do that, okay?

31:10.300 --> 31:13.567
In the boat, come on, boy.
Atta boy.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.333
-KATE: Down you go.
-Now I got you.

31:16.467 --> 31:17.967
Good boy.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.667
KATE: He looks so pathetic
out there.

31:19.700 --> 31:22.867
He's just holding onto Andy
for dear life.

31:22.900 --> 31:24.467
You sure make it
hard to paddle, though,

31:24.500 --> 31:26.667
with you right in my face
like this.

31:26.700 --> 31:29.133
Jack was pretty tentative
getting in the canoe.

31:29.167 --> 31:32.933
Uh, he's still a young dog,
he hasn't had a lot
of experience.

31:32.967 --> 31:35.300
I don't expect him to do
perfect on any of this stuff.

31:35.333 --> 31:37.133
You know,
it's all repetition with dogs.

31:37.167 --> 31:38.733
You got to do it
over and over.

31:38.767 --> 31:41.700
KATE: This is the whole point
of it, is to have them

31:41.733 --> 31:44.167
experience different
situations, you know?

31:44.200 --> 31:45.633
They've got to learn
that where they're put,

31:45.667 --> 31:48.100
and they're told
to sit and stay,
that that's where they stay.

31:48.733 --> 31:49.833
ANDY: Out, out.

31:50.800 --> 31:52.067
(KATE CHUCKLES)

31:52.100 --> 31:54.967
ANDY: All right, Jack,
out, out. Good boy.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
-Yay.
-KATE: Yeah!

31:57.033 --> 32:01.033
Mainly, the experience
was just to get the dogs
settled down in the canoe,

32:01.067 --> 32:03.933
get them used
to riding in the canoe
without jumping around.

32:03.967 --> 32:07.833
For me, Topaz is, kind of,
the star of the day
as far as performance goes.

32:07.867 --> 32:11.867
She did a great job leading,
great job riding in the canoe.

32:11.900 --> 32:13.033
Time to be a lead dog.

32:13.067 --> 32:16.267
Actually,
let's put Jack in front.
See if he can go home.

32:16.300 --> 32:20.400
Jack. No, you've been demoted,
Jack's gonna be lead dog!

32:20.433 --> 32:22.700
Yay, Jack, the lead dog.

32:22.733 --> 32:26.967
It was a big surprise
that Topaz was the easy
one and Jack wasn't.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.500
Because we'd have lost money
if we had bet the other way.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.000
ANDY: Let's go. Hup-hup.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.633
Whoo-hoo! Let's go!

32:33.667 --> 32:36.533
What I'm trying to do
is build confidence with Jack,

32:36.567 --> 32:38.300
and the only way
I'm gonna build confidence

32:38.333 --> 32:40.033
is to give him
a lot of experience.

32:43.633 --> 32:47.700
I think this was really good
for me to have a chance
during the summer months

32:47.733 --> 32:51.300
to put them to the test
and to do some
different things with them.

32:51.333 --> 32:53.967
Things that most people
don't do with sled dogs.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.100
They really excel
at what they're doing
once they have confidence.

32:57.133 --> 32:59.600
And that's the key.
You got to get the confidence

32:59.633 --> 33:00.900
or you don't get
the performance,

33:00.933 --> 33:02.900
so I'm really excited.

33:07.367 --> 33:11.900
GLENN: Every day
out here is uncertain, and
that makes it interesting.

33:11.933 --> 33:13.800
I never know
what's gonna happen.

33:13.833 --> 33:15.233
That's part of the reason
I'm here.

33:30.833 --> 33:32.233
Oh, that's hot!

33:34.233 --> 33:38.033
I got my sweat lodge built.
It's a beautiful curved shape.

33:38.067 --> 33:39.267
I went with a dome.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.433
Never built a dome before,
turned out pretty good.

33:42.900 --> 33:44.100
(SIZZLING)

33:46.500 --> 33:47.733
Nice.

33:52.733 --> 33:58.400
It's as much
a psychological benefit
as physical for me.

33:58.433 --> 34:00.667
Just to sit here.
It's just so calm.

34:00.700 --> 34:03.700
And it purifies
and it puts your consciousness
in a different place.

34:03.733 --> 34:07.133
It's just very relaxing.
It's very meditative.

34:11.133 --> 34:12.300
GLENN: Phew.

34:12.333 --> 34:13.667
Oh. It's hot.

34:14.733 --> 34:16.467
Oh.

34:16.500 --> 34:19.700
The contrast between
the heat and the cold,
it really is invigorating.

34:19.733 --> 34:20.900
It just gets the heart going.

34:20.933 --> 34:22.267
It gets the blood
in circulation.

34:25.133 --> 34:28.500
Keeps you feeling vital.
That's what it's all about
out here.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.433
Being alive.

34:33.500 --> 34:36.400
SUE: The arctic is full
of opportunists.

34:36.433 --> 34:39.033
Human beings
as well as the animals.

34:39.067 --> 34:41.300
It's hard to eke a life
out here.

34:42.433 --> 34:43.600
It challenges me.

34:54.267 --> 34:58.600
So, last night and yesterday,
it was a big day,
a lot of hiking.

34:58.633 --> 35:01.700
And went after
some caribou that I saw,

35:01.733 --> 35:04.667
and it turned out
to be cows and calves.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.667
You know, the numbers say
there's one lone cow,

35:06.700 --> 35:09.733
but I couldn't separate
who was who,
so I had to let him go.

35:09.767 --> 35:11.833
I continued on
to the fishing hole.

35:11.867 --> 35:13.833
Caught the limit
for the day and...

35:13.867 --> 35:17.200
But it took... It was another
six, eight miles hiking
getting back here.

35:17.233 --> 35:21.900
So I've got my fishies here.
I did not, uh, finish cleaning
them out yesterday.

35:21.933 --> 35:23.300
I just had to get warm.

35:23.333 --> 35:27.000
As you can see,
I'm sleeping on a metal floor.

35:27.033 --> 35:29.867
You know, I'm over 50,
I'm overweight,
I smoke cigarettes,

35:29.900 --> 35:32.367
hiking my brains out
at 30 degrees.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.967
So I'm a little slow-going
this morning.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.067
But I want to get out there
and get these guys
taken care of.

35:40.100 --> 35:42.800
At these temperatures,
they're perfectly fine
to leave overnight,

35:42.833 --> 35:44.967
but I don't wanna
leave them any longer
than that.

36:15.333 --> 36:16.467
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

36:19.267 --> 36:23.233
Fuck, fuck. My scope,
it's all fogged on the inside.

36:30.700 --> 36:32.067
(SEAGULL SQUEALS)

36:33.200 --> 36:35.033
You got hit,
you son of a bitch.

36:50.067 --> 36:51.200
There he is.

36:52.967 --> 36:54.433
A little heart rock.

36:55.567 --> 36:58.433
Thank you very much,
from my heart to yours, buddy.

36:58.467 --> 37:01.433
You'll be some
tasty little meat,
keep me going this winter.

37:03.533 --> 37:06.200
Get this guy cut up,
get those fish cut up,

37:06.233 --> 37:08.167
have some surf and turf
for dinner.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.633
I mean, I thought
I was tired before,

37:10.667 --> 37:12.800
and now I just made
a lot more work for myself,

37:12.833 --> 37:16.333
but that's the work
that keeps you alive
in the winter.

37:18.700 --> 37:23.900
Couldn't ask
for a more successful
two-day venture.

37:25.067 --> 37:26.800
You know?

37:26.833 --> 37:31.833
Got my limit on fish,
got a little bit of meat
for the freezie.

37:34.033 --> 37:35.333
It's a good trip.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.867
It's a time of harvesting.

37:41.900 --> 37:45.433
Get your whatever
you're gonna use to eat
for the winter,

37:45.467 --> 37:47.100
better get it in.

37:47.133 --> 37:49.533
Any little bit I get done
before the snow flies,

37:49.567 --> 37:51.900
adds in to being able to make
it until the snow melts.

37:52.933 --> 37:54.133
That's the goal.

37:54.167 --> 37:57.067
I got to come out here
and it's great peace of mind

37:57.100 --> 37:59.133
for me to be able to just take
a couple of days away

37:59.167 --> 38:03.233
from the hectic-ness,
and relax out here.

38:03.267 --> 38:07.133
But getting the fish,
finding the fishing hole,
getting a caribou,

38:07.700 --> 38:09.367
it's productive.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.233
It went from being
just a couple days

38:11.267 --> 38:13.267
and a nice thing
a buddy did for me,

38:13.300 --> 38:19.333
to putting meat in the freezer
and being able to sustain
myself this winter.

38:19.367 --> 38:22.800
So it's, uh, all around,
what a really great trip.

38:30.700 --> 38:33.367
CHIP: I can just go get it
myself and make a living
from the land around me.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.967
And that's subsistence,
that's real freedom.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.600
This is, uh, not too big
of an island,
but it's not too small.

38:49.633 --> 38:50.833
Try not to fall in the water.

38:50.867 --> 38:53.200
Most of the water isn't
any deeper than the boots.

38:53.233 --> 38:55.967
Stay in pairs.
If somebody gets stuck in mud,
you help them out.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.033
You girls know to keep
your eyes on these seagulls
'cause they'll dive.

38:59.067 --> 39:00.267
You will know you're close
to a nest

39:00.300 --> 39:01.967
when they are trying
to hit you in the head.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.067
The goal for the summer
is to get eggs

39:04.100 --> 39:06.500
and save them up.
We like to eat the fresh eggs.

39:06.533 --> 39:10.600
'Cause even though
there weren't any yesterday,
today might be the day.

39:10.633 --> 39:13.333
AGNES: This is a real nice
area. We call it the flats.

39:15.100 --> 39:17.800
We're able to see
long distances

39:17.833 --> 39:19.400
and keep an eye on each other.

39:19.433 --> 39:22.367
I'm always glad
that you can see for,
like, a mile away.

39:24.533 --> 39:27.833
CHIP: We just got to these
mud flats, and my kids
are all dispersing.

39:27.867 --> 39:30.333
We get to go out here
and go egg hunting.

39:30.367 --> 39:32.567
I really hope I run into
something good.

39:36.633 --> 39:38.433
Uh, there's no nest here.

39:38.467 --> 39:40.533
Probably one was making one,

39:40.567 --> 39:42.900
but I don't think
they finished.

39:42.933 --> 39:47.000
Here's a nest,
still being worked on,
but there's no eggs yet.

39:49.767 --> 39:52.300
Sometimes we always walk
for miles and miles

39:52.333 --> 39:54.000
just to find one nest.

39:57.767 --> 40:01.500
There's geese, swans, cranes,
there's seagulls,

40:01.533 --> 40:03.967
and they live
on these islands.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.033
They like to be
on these little patches
in between here.

40:06.067 --> 40:07.733
All this water,
these mud flats,

40:07.767 --> 40:11.867
and they make their nests
and they lay their eggs,
and we gather them.

40:11.900 --> 40:16.167
We're actually trying
to get a renewable resource,
and not impact the population.

40:17.067 --> 40:18.100
(TINMIAQ SPEAKING)

40:18.133 --> 40:20.133
Nope, I think we're too early.

40:20.167 --> 40:21.233
I don't think we're too early.

40:21.267 --> 40:22.633
I think we need
to keep walking.

40:22.667 --> 40:24.800
I think we're still...

40:24.833 --> 40:27.200
-So, which way you wanna go?
-Go through.

40:30.767 --> 40:32.000
AGNES: Right in there.

40:32.933 --> 40:34.933
Nothing? Seriously?

40:35.900 --> 40:37.067
(QUTAN SPEAKING)

40:38.633 --> 40:41.200
AGNES: We walked, like, a mile
and there's still no eggs,

40:41.233 --> 40:43.067
so we're just going
to keep looking.

40:43.100 --> 40:45.200
-Right, Qutan?
-Yeah.

40:45.233 --> 40:47.067
Okay, let's go walk
over this way.

40:47.100 --> 40:48.933
Hopefully, there will be some
over here.

40:48.967 --> 40:51.867
CHIP: I got all my daughters
out here, and I got
my wife out here,

40:51.900 --> 40:54.000
and they're scattered all over
this island. (CHUCKLES)

40:54.033 --> 40:55.900
Hopefully, the kiddos
are doing good.

40:55.933 --> 40:57.933
Oh! I can see eggs, Ting!

41:02.100 --> 41:04.200
Six of them. Six eggs.

41:07.400 --> 41:10.100
Okay, starting to get
a little scared.

41:10.133 --> 41:11.933
CHIP: This is, kind of,
a crazy spring for us.

41:11.967 --> 41:13.267
The break up came probably

41:13.300 --> 41:15.133
three to four
weeks early this year.

41:15.167 --> 41:18.267
It makes it difficult
when the weather patterns
have changed so severely.

41:19.467 --> 41:21.967
AGNES: (CHUCKLING) Oh!
Finally.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.767
This is the first time
Qutan's ever looked for eggs,

41:24.800 --> 41:27.733
so, um, this is, kind of,
a fun time for her.

41:27.767 --> 41:30.233
I'm glad she found a few.

41:37.367 --> 41:39.033
This is a good first day,
I'd say.

41:39.067 --> 41:40.867
-Yeah.
-I wonder
what the other kids have.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.700
QUTAN: How much did you get?

41:43.733 --> 41:45.667
(IDI SPEAKING)

41:45.700 --> 41:47.233

41:47.267 --> 41:50.033
AGNES: It's not really
a competition,
but it is really exciting

41:50.067 --> 41:52.933
when everybody gets together
and we get to count
everybody's eggs

41:52.967 --> 41:54.733
and see how much
we come up with.

41:54.767 --> 41:57.567
Now, you can't count the one
that broke as half-eight.

41:57.600 --> 41:58.867
CHIP: Yeah, I counted mine.

41:58.900 --> 42:00.367
AGNES: Okay, then. (CHUCKLING)

42:00.400 --> 42:01.933
How much did you guys get?

42:01.967 --> 42:03.333
QUTAN: We got 13.
CHIP: Two dozen.

42:03.367 --> 42:05.700
We have, um, 24 all total
and then you have 17?

-Me and Mary got 17.
-MARY: 17, but one broke.

42:13.633 --> 42:16.667
-We got 13.

but one broke.

-We got 20!
-Whoo!

42:20.233 --> 42:21.600
When we wake up
in the morning,

42:21.633 --> 42:23.733
we'll be having
some real good breakfast.
