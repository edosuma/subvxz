29:33.539 --> 29:35.407
YES, SIR.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.543
WHO IS IT?

29:37.576 --> 29:40.412
CAPTAIN TAPPMAN, SIR.
HE'S A GROUP CHAPLAIN.

29:40.446 --> 29:41.580
WELL, WHAT
DOES HE WANT?

29:41.613 --> 29:44.984
I DON'T KNOW, SIR. SOMETHING
TO DO WITH CAPTAIN YOSSARIAN.

29:48.454 --> 29:52.391
LOOK, UM...SERGEANT,

29:52.424 --> 29:55.928
SEE, UH, THE JOB
THAT I HAVE TO DO
IS TOUGH ENOUGH

29:55.962 --> 29:58.397
WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL
ALL THE TIME

29:58.430 --> 29:59.932
WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO WANT SOMETHING.

29:59.966 --> 30:00.599
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

30:00.632 --> 30:02.268
YES, SIR.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.536
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE
WONDERING ABOUT THIS.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.039
NO, SIR. IT'S NOT
MY PLACE TO WONDER.

30:07.073 --> 30:09.275
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
STARING AT ME, SERGEANT.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.843
PEOPLE STARE AT ME.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

30:10.877 --> 30:11.743
NO, SIR.

30:11.777 --> 30:13.846
THEY'RE THINKING,
"WHO'S THAT MAJOR MAJOR

30:13.880 --> 30:15.848
"THAT HE GETS TO BE
SQUADRON COMMANDER

30:15.882 --> 30:18.217
WITHOUT EVER HAVING
FLOWN IN A PLANE?"

30:18.250 --> 30:20.452
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
ARE THINKING THAT, SIR.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.453
WELL, THEY ARE.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.955
BUT WHEN
I HAVE THIS ON,

30:22.989 --> 30:26.458
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHO I AM.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.961
DID YOU KNOW,
IN THE MIDDLE AGES

30:28.995 --> 30:31.330
A LOT OF PRINCES
AND KINGS

30:31.363 --> 30:33.966
PUT ON DISGUISES
AND WALKED AROUND
THEIR SUBJECTS?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.434
NO, SIR,
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.069
SO YOU DON'T KNOW
EVERYTHING, DO YOU,
SERGEANT?

30:37.103 --> 30:39.972
NO, SIR.
WHY DID THEY DO THAT?

30:40.006 --> 30:42.074
WHY DID WHO
 DO WHAT?

30:42.108 --> 30:43.442
WHY DID PRINCES
AND KINGS

30:43.475 --> 30:45.477
WALK AROUND
IN DISGUISE?

30:45.511 --> 30:48.080
HOW THE HELL
SHOULD I KNOW?

30:48.114 --> 30:50.449
I'M NOT SOME
HISTORIAN--

30:50.482 --> 30:53.419
JUST A GUY TRYING
TO DO HIS JOB.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.254
GOOD AFTERNOON,
SERGEANT.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.956
SIR?

30:56.989 --> 30:59.425
WHAT IS IT NOW?

30:59.458 --> 31:00.993
WHAT ABOUT
THE CHAPLAIN?

31:01.027 --> 31:02.361
SERGEANT,
FROM NOW ON,

31:02.394 --> 31:03.963
I DON'T WANT
ANYONE COMING IN
TO SEE ME

31:03.996 --> 31:05.998
WHILE I'M
IN MY OFFICE.
IS THAT CLEAR?

31:06.032 --> 31:08.300
YES, SIR. WHAT DO
I SAY TO PEOPLE?

31:08.334 --> 31:10.469
TELL THEM I'M IN AND
ASK THEM TO WAIT.

31:10.502 --> 31:11.637
FOR HOW LONG?

31:11.670 --> 31:12.638
UNTIL I'VE LEFT.

31:12.671 --> 31:13.973
THEN WHAT?

31:14.006 --> 31:14.806
I DON'T CARE.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.043
MAY I SEND PEOPLE IN
AFTER YOU'VE LEFT?

31:17.076 --> 31:17.910
YES.

31:17.944 --> 31:19.111
NO.
YOU WON'T BE HERE
THEN, WILL YOU?

31:19.145 --> 31:20.579
I SEE, SIR.
WILL THAT BE ALL?

31:20.612 --> 31:22.982
ALSO, I DON'T WANT
YOU COMING IN

31:23.015 --> 31:24.984
ASKING ME
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU CAN DO FOR ME.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.485
YES, SIR.
IS THAT CLEAR?

31:26.518 --> 31:28.487
WHEN SHOULD I ASK YOU?

31:28.520 --> 31:29.989
WHEN I'M NOT THERE.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.590
WHAT DO I DO THEN?

31:31.623 --> 31:32.691
WHATEVER HAS TO BE DONE.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.592
YES, SIR.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.995
I'M SORRY I HAVE TO
TALK TO YOU THIS WAY,

31:36.028 --> 31:37.663
BUT I HAVE TO.

31:37.696 --> 31:39.598
GOOD-BYE.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.200
GOOD-BYE, SIR.

31:46.538 --> 31:47.673
SERGEANT?

31:47.706 --> 31:49.108
YES, SIR?

31:49.141 --> 31:51.010
THANK YOU...
FOR EVERYTHING.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.945
THANK YOU, SIR.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.019
THE MAJOR WILL
SEE YOU NOW, FATHER.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.653
OH. THANK YOU.

32:01.687 --> 32:04.723
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
CALL ME FATHER. I'M--

32:04.756 --> 32:06.692
SERGEANT TOWSER
SPEAKING.

32:06.725 --> 32:08.727
WILL YOU GO IN?

32:08.760 --> 32:10.562
YES, SIR.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.531
HAVE IT HERE, SIR.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.707
THERE'S NO ONE HERE.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.009
WHERE?

32:23.042 --> 32:24.476
IN MAJOR MAJOR'S
OFFICE.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.012
WHEN?

32:26.045 --> 32:28.347
WHEN YOU GO
TO SEE HIM.

32:28.380 --> 32:31.583
WHAT I MEAN IS
YOU CAN'T SEE HIM

32:31.617 --> 32:34.020
WHEN HE'S THERE
IN HIS OFFICE.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.288
I'VE TRIED
SEVERAL TIMES.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.024
SO WHEN CAN YOU
SEE HIM? EVER?

32:38.057 --> 32:40.359
YES. YES, YES,
INDEED.

32:40.392 --> 32:43.662
YOU CAN SEE HIM
WHEN HE ISN'T THERE.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.465
THAT IS,
HE'LL SEE YOU,

32:46.498 --> 32:49.135
BUT ONLY
IN HIS OFFICE

32:49.168 --> 32:50.736
AND ONLY WHEN
HE'S NOT THERE.

32:50.769 --> 32:54.106
THE OTHER TIMES,
WHEN HE'S IN,

32:54.140 --> 32:58.044
HE'S NOT, UH...
THERE...

32:58.077 --> 32:59.545
TO BE SEEN...

32:59.578 --> 33:03.149
EXCEPT WHEN
HE'S OUT.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.617
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, FATHER?

33:05.651 --> 33:06.685
SIR?

33:06.718 --> 33:09.121
GET YOUR ASS
IN HERE, PADRE.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.424
WERE YOU DESCRIBING

33:12.458 --> 33:14.660
SOME MYSTICAL
EXPERIENCE
YOU'VE HAD?

33:14.693 --> 33:15.727
NO, SIR.

33:15.761 --> 33:17.629
IT'S JUST THAT SOME
PECULIAR THINGS
ARE HAPPENING.

33:17.663 --> 33:20.499
YOU HAVEN'T HAD ANY
ECSTATIC VISIONS,
HAVE YOU?

33:20.532 --> 33:21.433
NO, SIR.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.802
DIDN'T SEE
A BURNING BUSH?
HEAR ANY VOICES?

33:23.835 --> 33:25.704
IT WASN'T ANYTHING
SO EXTRAORDINARY--

33:25.737 --> 33:27.406
I HOPE NOT.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.808
WE HAVE TO KEEP
OUR SUPERNATURAL EPISODES

33:29.841 --> 33:32.811
DOWN TO A MINIMUM,
WHAT WITH A WAR TO WIN.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.446
YOU GET MY MEANING?

33:34.480 --> 33:36.715
ABSOLUTELY, SIR.
MAY I ASK WHERE
WE'RE GOING?

33:36.748 --> 33:38.484
WHERE WE'RE GOING?

33:38.517 --> 33:41.787
YOUARE GOING TO
 COLONEL CATHCART'S
 OFFICE.

33:41.820 --> 33:43.122
NOW?

33:43.155 --> 33:45.691
THAT'S THE IDEA,
PADRE--NOW.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.759
IS THERE ANYTHING
WRONG, SIR?

33:47.793 --> 33:49.828
HAVE I DONE ANYTHING?

33:49.861 --> 33:51.530
I DON'T KNOW.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.832
ARE YOU
AND CAPTAIN YOSSARIAN
UP TO SOMETHING?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.834
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU MEAN, SIR.

33:55.867 --> 33:56.835
YOU DON'T, HUH?
THEN WHO DOES?

33:56.868 --> 33:58.404
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

33:58.437 --> 34:01.540
YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT ANYTHING,
DO YOU, FATHER?

34:01.573 --> 34:03.509
NO, SIR. UH, SIR...

34:03.542 --> 34:04.843
WHAT IS IT?

34:04.876 --> 34:07.813
IT'S NOT NECESSARY
TO CALL ME FATHER.

34:07.846 --> 34:09.815
I'M AN ANABAPTIST.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.483
WELL, THANKS FOR
THE CORRECTION.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.619
THANKS FOR SETTING ME
STRAIGHT ON THAT.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.286
I THOUGHT YOU'D
LIKE TO KNOW.

34:15.321 --> 34:17.356
YES, SIR.
LISTEN, PADRE, YOU'RE
A CAPTAIN, RIGHT?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.824
AND I'M
A LIEUTENANT-COLONEL.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.126
IS THAT CORRECT SO FAR?

34:20.159 --> 34:21.592
YES, SIR, IT IS.

34:21.627 --> 34:24.496
THEN I CAN CALL YOU
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING
I WANT TO,

34:24.530 --> 34:25.831
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU HAVE SOME
OBJECTION.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.533
NO, SIR.
OUT!

34:27.565 --> 34:29.801
THANK YOU, SIR.

34:29.835 --> 34:32.571
UH, SIR,
DO YOU THINK NOW--

34:33.605 --> 34:34.840
MORNING.

34:34.873 --> 34:35.873
AH!

34:35.907 --> 34:37.643
ANYTHING
I CAN GET YOU?

34:37.676 --> 34:38.444
MORNING. WHAT?

34:38.476 --> 34:40.646
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?
ANY SUPPLIES?

34:40.679 --> 34:41.547
NO.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.581
WHISKEY? SILK STOCKINGS?
BUILDING MATERIAL?

34:43.614 --> 34:44.616
NO.

34:44.650 --> 34:45.851
FRESH FRUIT?

34:45.884 --> 34:47.719
OH, WELL, I--

34:47.753 --> 34:49.188
WHAT ABOUT
RELIGIOUS SUPPLIES?

34:49.221 --> 34:51.623
I CAN GET MY HANDS
ON AN ENTIRE SHIPMENT

34:51.657 --> 34:53.525
OF RELIGIOUS RELICS
BLESSED BY THE POPE
HIMSELF.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.726
THE GERMANS SWIPED THEM
AND PUT THEM ON THE MARKET.

34:55.761 --> 34:59.198
THE STUFF INCLUDES THE
WRISTS AND COLLARBONES
OF SOME TOP SAINTS.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.866
THAT'S VERY KIND
OF YOU.

35:00.899 --> 35:04.403
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
JUST ASK FOR MILO.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.737
I'VE NEVER BEEN
ISSUED A BLANKET.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.239
ANYTHING AT ALL, NOW.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.720
AHEM.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.355
YEAH?

35:23.389 --> 35:27.526
I THINK THE COLONEL
WANTS TO SEE ME.

35:27.559 --> 35:28.360
HE DOES?

35:28.394 --> 35:32.364
I BELIEVE SO.
I'M...CHAPLAIN
TAPPMAN.

35:32.398 --> 35:34.566
YOU'RE CHAPLAIN TAPPMAN?

35:34.600 --> 35:38.570
SIT DOWN.
I'LL TELL THE COLONEL
YOU'RE HERE, FATHER.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.138
IT'S NOT...

35:51.483 --> 35:54.753
YOU--YOU'D BETTER GET
SOME DRY THINGS.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.622
OH, I WILL,

35:56.655 --> 35:59.758
AS SOON AS
THE COLONEL'S
THROUGH WITH ME.

36:01.493 --> 36:04.930
THEY JUST
PICKED ME UP
OUT OF THE SEA.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.765
THEY DID?

36:06.798 --> 36:08.867
I DRIFTED FOR
ALMOST THREE DAYS.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.869
YOU SHOULD REPORT
TO THE HOSPITAL.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.871
YOU COULD CATCH
PNEUMONIA.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.406
OH, NO. NOT ME.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.941
THIS IS
MY FOURTH TIME.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.509
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

36:17.543 --> 36:19.878
I'VE PUT DOWN IN
THE MEDITERRANEAN
ONCE,

36:19.911 --> 36:21.413
ONCE
IN THE ADRIATIC,

36:21.447 --> 36:23.782
AND I CRASH-LANDED
ONE PLANE,

36:23.815 --> 36:25.684
AND I BAILED OUT
ONCE.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.886
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.888
THAT'S WHAT
SOME FOLKS SAY.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.890
YOSSARIAN SAYS
THEY'RE GONNA
START

36:31.923 --> 36:34.560
TAKING IT OUT
OF MY SALARY.

36:34.593 --> 36:35.994
Y-YOSSARIAN?

36:36.027 --> 36:37.896
YES, HE'S
A FRIEND OF MINE.
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

36:37.929 --> 36:39.898
YES, I DO. IN FACT--

36:39.931 --> 36:41.600
CAPTAIN TAPPMAN?

36:41.633 --> 36:43.201
YES.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.805
PERHAPS YOU SHOULDN'T
FLY ANYMORE.

36:46.838 --> 36:49.575
IT'S GOOD PRACTICE.

36:49.608 --> 36:52.944
TAPPMAN, THE COLONEL
IS A VERY BUSY MAN.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.247
YES. YES, OF COURSE.

37:02.488 --> 37:05.824
CHAPLAIN, WE DON'T SEE
MUCH OF YOU LATELY.

37:05.857 --> 37:06.825
WELL, SIR, I...

37:06.858 --> 37:10.796
I TRY TO STAY OUT OF THE WAY
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

37:10.829 --> 37:13.999
I HAVE A FEELING I MAKE
THE MEN UNCOMFORTABLE.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.835
NONSENSE.
I CAN'T IMAGINE
ANY MAN

37:16.868 --> 37:20.406
NOT ENJOYING
THE BENEFITS
OF YOUR PRESENCE,

37:20.439 --> 37:22.474
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THEY'RE ATHEISTS.

37:22.508 --> 37:24.976
I GUESS THERE'S NOT
MUCH CHANCE OF THAT,
IS THERE?

37:25.010 --> 37:26.612
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

37:26.645 --> 37:29.581
YOU DON'T KNOW?
ATHEISM IS AGAINST
THE LAW, RIGHT?

37:29.615 --> 37:30.616
NO.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.884
IT ISN'T? WELL, THEN,
IT'S UN-AMERICAN, ISN'T IT?

37:32.918 --> 37:34.786
I'M NOT SURE, SIR.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.788
WELL, I AM.

37:36.822 --> 37:39.558
IF I FIND ANY LOUSY
ATHEISTS ON THIS BASE,

37:39.591 --> 37:42.628
BET YOUR ASS
THEY'LL SOON START
BELIEVING IN SOMETHING.

37:42.661 --> 37:45.964
THAT'S NOT WHY
I CALLED YOU IN, CHAPLAIN.

37:45.997 --> 37:49.768
I WANT YOU
TO LOOK AT THIS.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.703
PAGE 48.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.644
YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ
THE WHOLE THING.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.679
YOU CAN GET THE POINT
FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHS.

38:00.712 --> 38:03.715
THERE'S A FULL-PAGE PICTURE
OF A COLONEL IN ENGLAND

38:03.749 --> 38:07.586
WHOSE CHAPLAIN
CONDUCTS PRAYERS
BEFORE EVERY MISSION.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.722
I SEE NO REASON WHY
 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST

38:10.756 --> 38:13.959
SHOULD NOT BE INTERESTED
 IN THE STORY OF MY OUTFIT.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.528
YOU THINK UP SOME
NICE, SNAPPY PRAYERS

38:16.562 --> 38:18.797
THAT'LL SEND THE OFFICERS OUT
FEELING GOOD.

38:18.830 --> 38:22.401
AHH! CAN YOU DO THAT? HMM?

38:22.434 --> 38:23.902
I'LL TRY.

38:23.935 --> 38:26.672
WELL, GOOD.
LET'S GET TO IT.

38:26.705 --> 38:27.873
YES, SIR.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.448
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

38:36.482 --> 38:40.452
SIR, IT MAY BE
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

38:40.486 --> 38:44.456
BUT I THINK SOME
OF THE MEN ARE
PARTICULARLY UPSET

38:44.490 --> 38:47.025
ABOUT THE FACT
THAT YOU KEEP RAISING

38:47.058 --> 38:49.595
THE NUMBER OF MISSIONS
THEY HAVE TO FLY.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.899
YOU'RE RIGHT, CHAPLAIN.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.567
I AM, SIR?

38:55.601 --> 38:57.569
YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT'S
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

38:57.603 --> 38:59.438

39:01.907 --> 39:05.544

CAPTAIN YOSSARIAN.

39:32.704 --> 39:33.839
HE'S ALWAYS
BITCHING,

39:33.872 --> 39:35.006
ALWAYS
MAKING TROUBLE.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.174
WHAT CAN WE DO?

39:36.207 --> 39:39.745
WHAT WOULD
GENERAL DREEDLE DO?

39:39.778 --> 39:41.913

IN THE KIDNEYS.

39:45.651 --> 39:46.852

39:46.885 --> 39:48.987
UH! OOH!

39:49.020 --> 39:50.889

BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.931

DEEPLY AND EVENLY.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.567
UGH!

40:01.600 --> 40:04.836
SORRY, CAPTAIN.
I KNOW HOW THAT
MUST FEEL.

40:04.870 --> 40:05.704
I DON'T THINK SO.

40:05.737 --> 40:09.074

ALWAYS TRY TO SPOIL IT.

WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
TRY TO SPOIL IT?

BUT THIS IS WARTIME.
WE'VE GOT A JOB

40:37.769 --> 40:40.005
MEN WHO ARE
GIVING UP
THEIR LIVES

40:40.038 --> 40:42.808
FOR OUR COUNTRY,
FOR ME.

40:42.841 --> 40:44.009
THINK OF THAT--

40:44.042 --> 40:46.077

40:46.111 --> 40:48.246
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:48.279 --> 40:50.549

THE TOWN'S NAME
IS FERRARA,

41:08.534 --> 41:10.502
AND, UH, IT'S

41:36.895 --> 41:38.864
UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY HAVEN'T ARRIVED,

41:38.897 --> 41:41.767
BUT, AS I ALWAYS SAY,
NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.536
A LOT OF YOU MAY ASK
YOURSELVES,

41:44.570 --> 41:47.305
"HOW COME WE'RE OUT
TO DESTROY A TOWN

41:47.338 --> 41:49.875
"THAT HAS NO INDUSTRY?

48:05.016 --> 48:06.684
WELL, I DON'T SEE IT
THAT WAY.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.186
GUYS, THEY WANT US
TO GO HOME WITH THEM.

48:08.219 --> 48:09.187
FOR HOW MUCH?

48:09.220 --> 48:10.021
$30!

48:10.055 --> 48:11.422
WHO'S THE RUNT?

48:11.456 --> 48:13.391
NATELY'S WHORE'S
KID SISTER.

48:13.424 --> 48:15.426
COME ON. I WANT TO SPEND
SOME TIME WITH MY GIRL.

48:15.460 --> 48:16.962
I'LL PAY FOR ALL OF US.

48:16.995 --> 48:19.965
WHY NOT GIVE HER $30
AND SEND THE OTHERS AWAY?

48:19.998 --> 48:22.067
THEN SHE'LL BE
ANGRY WITH ME

48:22.100 --> 48:23.268
FOR MAKING HER
WORK FOR HER MONEY.

48:23.301 --> 48:24.970
SHE SAYS IF I
REALLY LOVED HER,

48:25.003 --> 48:26.972
I'D SEND HER AWAY
AND SLEEP WITH
THE OTHERS.

48:27.005 --> 48:28.473
I SWEAR, YOU FELLAS.

48:30.008 --> 48:32.543
COME ON, YOSSARIAN,
LET'S GO.

48:32.577 --> 48:35.981
GO ON, YOU GO.

48:36.014 --> 48:37.448
WHAT'S WRONG?

48:37.482 --> 48:39.084
WHAT ISN'T WRONG?

48:39.117 --> 48:42.087
TWO MORE MISSIONS,
AND WE'RE ON
OUR WAY HOME.

48:42.120 --> 48:44.322
YOU KNOW
WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

48:44.355 --> 48:46.457
NO. A WHOLE BUNCH
OF REPLACEMENT
PILOTS

48:46.491 --> 48:48.626
CAME INTO NAPLES
YESTERDAY.

48:48.659 --> 48:50.996
MILO JUST CAME
FROM THERE

48:51.029 --> 48:52.563
WITH 20 TRUCKLOADS
OF COCONUTS.

48:52.597 --> 48:55.633
WE'LL NEVER SEE
THOSE REPLACEMENTS
OR THOSE COCONUTS.

48:55.666 --> 48:59.637
CATHCART WOULDN'T DARE
RAISE THE NUMBER
OF MISSIONS AGAIN.

48:59.670 --> 49:01.973
WHO'S GONNA
STOP HIM?

49:04.509 --> 49:06.077
SOMEBODY WILL.

49:10.681 --> 49:12.383
COME ON.

49:16.687 --> 49:18.456
NATELY!

49:18.489 --> 49:20.491
HEY, NATELY,
WAIT FOR ME!

49:21.692 --> 49:23.428
YO!

51:21.546 --> 51:22.847
ALL RIGHT...

51:22.880 --> 51:25.850
I WANT TO GET THIS CLEAR.

51:25.883 --> 51:27.852
AS I UNDERSTAND IT,

51:27.885 --> 51:30.188
WE'RE PRESENTING
THESE MEN WITH MEDALS

51:30.221 --> 51:31.856
FOR DOING A LOUSY JOB.
IS THAT RIGHT?

51:31.889 --> 51:33.724
THAT'S NOT QUITE
THE SITUATION, DAD.

51:33.758 --> 51:36.394
WHEN I WANT AN ANSWER
FROM YOU, I'LL LOOK AT YOU,

51:36.427 --> 51:37.495
WHICH WILL BE AS SELDOM
AS POSSIBLE.

51:37.528 --> 51:39.564
GENERAL, I THINK
I CAN EXPLAIN IT.

51:39.597 --> 51:41.199
YOU DAMN WELL BETTER.

51:41.232 --> 51:43.734
YESTERDAY'S MISSION
WAS TO BOMB FERRARA.

51:43.768 --> 51:45.836
FERRARA?

51:45.870 --> 51:47.438
WHY FERRARA?

51:47.472 --> 51:49.807
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHY FERRARA?

51:49.840 --> 51:51.609
YOU KNOW WHAT
FERRARA IS?

51:51.642 --> 51:54.345
IT'S A TOWN
ON A HILL.

51:54.379 --> 51:56.214
Yossarian: YOU KNOW
WHAT'S IN THAT TOWN?

51:56.247 --> 51:57.582
FIVE MINUTES
TO TARGET.

51:57.615 --> 51:58.583
WHAT'S IN IT?

51:58.616 --> 51:59.584
NOTHING.

51:59.617 --> 52:00.518
WHAT?

52:00.551 --> 52:03.588
NOTHING'S IN IT,
NO GERMANS,
NO MUNITIONS,

52:03.621 --> 52:07.858
NO RAILROAD CROSSING,
NO HARBOR, NOTHING.

52:07.892 --> 52:10.161
NOTHING AT ALL?

52:10.195 --> 52:13.764
NO, EXCEPT PEOPLE,
ITALIAN PEOPLE.

52:13.798 --> 52:15.466
AND A MONASTERY.

52:17.668 --> 52:20.871
YOSSARIAN, MAYBE IT'S
SOME KIND OF STRATEGY THING.

52:20.905 --> 52:23.608
WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING?

52:23.641 --> 52:26.877
YOSSARIAN, IT'S NOT
OUR BUSINESS TO ASK.

52:26.911 --> 52:28.379
WHOSE BUSINESS IS IT?

52:28.413 --> 52:29.880
FOUR MINUTES
TO TARGET.

52:29.914 --> 52:31.649
TAKE US IN,
YOSSARIAN.

52:31.682 --> 52:33.518
GET READY TO DUCK.

52:33.551 --> 52:35.786
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

52:35.820 --> 52:36.887
GET AWAY FROM THERE,
AARDVARK.

52:36.921 --> 52:38.956
YOSSARIAN,
YOU'LL SCREW UP
THE MISSION.

52:38.989 --> 52:41.392
GET READY TO TURN!

52:41.426 --> 52:43.194
YOSSARIAN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

52:43.228 --> 52:44.562
CUT IT OUT,
YOSSARIAN!

52:45.963 --> 52:48.199
DROP!

52:56.841 --> 52:58.976
A DIRECT HIT...

52:59.009 --> 53:00.545
ON THE OCEAN?

53:00.578 --> 53:03.414
YES, SIR.
A MARVELOUS
BOMB PATTERN.

53:03.448 --> 53:04.449
WE HAVE AERIAL
PHOTOGRAPHS,

53:04.482 --> 53:06.451
IF YOU'D LIKE
TO SEE THEM.

53:06.484 --> 53:08.519
YOU'RE TELLING ME WE'RE
DECORATING A BUNCH OF MEN

53:08.553 --> 53:11.422
WHO DROPPED 20 TONS
OF VERY EXPENSIVE BOMBS

53:11.456 --> 53:13.324
ON THE MEDITERRANEAN?

53:13.358 --> 53:16.594
WELL, SIR,
IF YOU CONSIDER
THE ALTERNATIVE...

53:16.627 --> 53:19.830
THE ALTERNATIVE IS THAT
WE TAKE THE WHOLE CREW
OF NUMBSKULLS OUT

53:19.864 --> 53:21.432
AND SHOOT THEM.

53:21.466 --> 53:22.567
MIGHT BE A PROBLEM
THERE, SIR.

53:22.600 --> 53:24.902
ALL RIGHT. I KNOW.

53:24.935 --> 53:27.738
IF WE CAN'T SHOOT
THE SONS OF BITCHES,

53:27.772 --> 53:29.807
WE CAN COURT-MARTIAL THEM,

53:29.840 --> 53:32.477
SEE THEY ROT
IN SOME STOCKADE.

53:32.510 --> 53:35.646
WELL, SIR,
WE FELT THAT
A COURT-MARTIAL

53:35.680 --> 53:37.748
MIGHT GET
UNAVOIDABLE
PUBLICITY.

53:37.782 --> 53:40.585
IF IT GOT AROUND
WE USED ONE OF
OUR MISSIONS

53:40.618 --> 53:42.553
TO BOMB THE OCEAN...

53:42.587 --> 53:44.789
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY
ANYTHING MORE, COLONEL.

53:52.863 --> 53:54.599
TEN-HUT!

54:03.908 --> 54:05.776
FOR DISTINGUISHED
DUTY

54:05.810 --> 54:09.414
IN THE FACE
OF OVERWHELMING...
SOMETHING...

54:09.447 --> 54:10.881
ODDS!

54:10.915 --> 54:11.882
THIS AIR MEDAL
IS AWARDED

54:11.916 --> 54:14.752
TO CAPTAIN J.S...

54:14.785 --> 54:15.986

54:16.020 --> 54:17.522
McWATT.

54:21.926 --> 54:24.629
COME ON, COME ON.

54:28.799 --> 54:31.702
McWATT, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR, A KISS?

54:31.736 --> 54:33.003
GET BACK IN THERE.

54:33.037 --> 54:35.906
AND ON THE DOUBLE!

54:35.940 --> 54:38.576
FOR MERITORIOUS
ACTION

54:38.609 --> 54:41.011

OF CONCENTRATED
ENEMY FIRE,

54:41.045 --> 54:42.613

54:42.647 --> 54:44.615
WHAT'S THIS?

54:44.649 --> 54:45.816
COME ON, DUMBO.

54:45.850 --> 54:47.318
YOSSARIAN,
SIR.

54:47.352 --> 54:48.653
YOSSARIAN.

55:01.499 --> 55:04.669
UNLESS I MISS MY GUESS,
CAPTAIN...

55:06.871 --> 55:08.573
YOU'RE OUT OF UNIFORM.

55:08.606 --> 55:10.908
[SNICKERING]

55:10.941 --> 55:14.412
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

55:14.445 --> 55:18.015
GET BACK IN THE CAR,
YOU SMIRKING SLUT.

55:18.048 --> 55:20.685
[WOMAN SOLDIER
GIGGLING]

55:24.522 --> 55:26.891
WHY AREN'T YOU
WEARING CLOTHES,
CAPTAIN?

55:26.924 --> 55:28.559
I DON'T WANT TO.

55:28.593 --> 55:30.961
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T WANT TO?

55:30.995 --> 55:33.631
WHY THE HELL
DON'T YOU?

55:33.664 --> 55:35.666
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO.

55:35.700 --> 55:37.435
WHY ISN'T HE
WEARING CLOTHES?

55:37.468 --> 55:38.469
HE'S TALKING
TO YOU.

55:38.503 --> 55:40.471
WHY ISN'T HE
WEARING CLOTHES,
MAJOR?

55:40.505 --> 55:42.773
Major: WHY ISN'T HE
WEARING CLOTHES,
SERGEANT?

55:42.807 --> 55:44.842
Sergeant:
A MAN WAS KILLED
IN HIS PLANE

55:44.875 --> 55:45.943
OVER AVIGNON
LAST WEEK

55:45.976 --> 55:47.478
AND BLED
ALL OVER HIM.

55:47.512 --> 55:48.446
HIS CLOTHES
HAVEN'T
COME BACK

55:48.479 --> 55:49.580
FROM THE LAUNDRY
YET.

55:49.614 --> 55:51.682
WHERE ARE
HIS OTHER UNIFORMS?

55:51.716 --> 55:52.983
THEY'RE IN
THE LAUNDRY,
TOO, SIR.

55:53.017 --> 55:55.052
WHERE'S HIS UNDERWEAR?

55:55.085 --> 55:57.054
Sergeant:
IN THE LAUNDRY,
SIR.

55:57.087 --> 56:00.057
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A LOT OF CRAP TO ME.

56:00.090 --> 56:03.594
IT IS A LOT
OF CRAP, SIR.

56:03.628 --> 56:05.162
SIR, THIS MAN
WILL BE PUNISHED
SEVERELY.

56:05.195 --> 56:06.797
WHAT THE HELL
DO I CARE?

56:06.831 --> 56:11.469
IF HE WANTS TO
RECEIVE A MEDAL
WITHOUT ANY CLOTHES ON,

56:11.502 --> 56:12.470
WHAT THE HELL BUSINESS
IS IT OF YOURS?

56:12.503 --> 56:15.973
MY SENTIMENTS
EXACTLY, SIR.

56:16.006 --> 56:18.576
HERE'S YOUR MEDAL,
CAPTAIN.

56:19.844 --> 56:23.881
YOU'RE A VERY WEIRD PERSON,
YOSSARIAN.

56:23.914 --> 56:26.651
THANK YOU, SIR.

56:29.587 --> 56:31.722
YOU ARE
GIVING ME THIS?

56:31.756 --> 56:32.890
YES.

56:32.923 --> 56:34.559
PERCHE?

56:34.592 --> 56:36.026
BECAUSE YOU'RE
VERY BEAUTIFUL

56:36.060 --> 56:37.562
AND BECAUSE
YOUR NAME IS LUCIANA.

56:37.595 --> 56:39.029
THAT WAS
MY MOTHER'S NAME.

56:39.063 --> 56:41.566
BUT MY REAL NAME
IS ELINORA ROSANNA.

56:41.599 --> 56:42.900
I ONLY CALL MYSELF
LUCIANA.

56:42.933 --> 56:46.471
HEY! MY MOTHER
ONLY CALLED HERSELF
LUCIANA.

56:46.504 --> 56:47.972
HER REAL NAME WAS
ELINORA ROSANNA.

56:48.005 --> 56:50.775
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

56:50.808 --> 56:52.009
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

56:54.545 --> 56:56.647
WHAT YOU
GET THIS FOR?

56:56.681 --> 56:59.850
WILL YOU BELIEVE ME
IF I TELL YOU
THE TRUTH?

56:59.884 --> 57:01.652
YES.

57:01.686 --> 57:05.189
OK. I WAS AWARDED
THAT PARTICULAR MEDAL
FOR KILLING FISH.

57:05.222 --> 57:07.592
OH-HO. YOU HAVE
KILLED MANY FISH?

57:07.625 --> 57:09.760
OH, YES. I AM ONE
OF THE BIGGEST--

57:09.794 --> 57:13.598
I AM THE MOST
RENOWNED KILLER
OF FISH

57:13.631 --> 57:16.601
IN THE WHOLE
UNITED STATES

57:16.634 --> 57:20.505
OK. I'LL DANCE
WITH YOU,

57:20.538 --> 57:22.206
BUT I WON'T LET YOU
SLEEP WITH ME.

57:22.239 --> 57:23.774
WHO ASKED YOU?

57:23.808 --> 57:25.476
YOU DON'T WANT
TO SLEEP WITH ME?

57:25.510 --> 57:26.944
I DON'T WANT
TO DANCE WITH YOU.

57:26.977 --> 57:28.045
YOU'RE CRAZY.

57:28.078 --> 57:29.814
MM-HMM. YOU THINK SO?

57:33.851 --> 57:36.521
WATCH WHERE YOU PUT
YOUR HANDS, G.I.

57:36.554 --> 57:38.656
MY NAME IS YOSSARIAN.

57:38.689 --> 57:41.626
WATCH WHERE YOU
PUT YOUR HANDS,
YOSSARIAN.

59:09.013 --> 59:11.649
IT'S, UH...

59:11.682 --> 59:13.984
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
THE NEW GUNNER?

59:14.018 --> 59:15.786
Pilot: SNOWDEN.

59:15.820 --> 59:17.021
YEAH.

59:19.957 --> 59:21.759
SNOWDEN.

59:22.960 --> 59:25.062
I'M COLD.

59:25.095 --> 59:28.332
OK. YOU'RE
GOING TO BE OK.

59:28.365 --> 59:31.702
I'M COLD. I'M COLD.

59:46.984 --> 59:48.619
THERE.

59:48.653 --> 59:50.688
IT'S STARTING
TO HURT ME.

59:50.721 --> 59:54.692
OK. HANG ON.
I'LL GET YOU
SOME MORPHINE.

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:23.988
MILO!

01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:25.723
YOU PRICK!

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:27.324
HI. WHAT'S UP?

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:28.726
HEY, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

01:00:28.759 --> 01:00:30.427
WHEN DID YOU
GET OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL?

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.962
NEVER MIND
ABOUT THE HOSPITAL.

01:00:31.996 --> 01:00:33.864
WE GOT A COUPLE THINGS
TO TALK OVER.

01:00:33.898 --> 01:00:34.799
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
HOW'S THE LEG?

01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:37.968
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T GET OVER
TO VISIT YOU,

01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:39.670
BUT I'VE BEEN
IN NAPLES ALL WEEK.

01:00:39.704 --> 01:00:41.138
MILO! I WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT
THAT PARACHUTE.

01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:42.740
WHAT PARACHUTE?

01:00:42.773 --> 01:00:43.941
MY PARACHUTE! THE ONE
 I'M SUPPOSED TO USE

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.142
IF I'VE GOT TO JUMP
OUT OF THE PLANE.

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:46.410
OH, THAT PARACHUTE.

01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:47.511
I THINK YOU HAVE TO
REMEMBER, YOSSARIAN,

01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:51.348
THAT YOUR PARACHUTE
WAS JUST 1 OF 50
OR 60 PARACHUTES

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.983
TAKEN OVER
BY THE SYNDICATE.

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:55.019
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT THE SYNDICATE.

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:55.920
HAVE A TOMATO.

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:58.989
I DON'T WANT ONE OF YOUR
GODDAMN TOMATOES.

01:00:59.023 --> 01:01:00.958
THEY'RE THE SYNDICATE'S
TOMATOES, OUR TOMATOES,

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:03.227
JUST AS THESE
ARE OUR STATUES.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:07.698
IN FACT, THAT'S WHERE
YOUR PARACHUTE WENT,
ALL THE PARACHUTES.

01:01:07.732 --> 01:01:10.034
YOU TRADED MY PARACHUTE
FOR A BUNCH OF STATUES?

01:01:10.067 --> 01:01:11.702
NO. POINT OF FACT,

01:01:11.736 --> 01:01:13.904
I TRADED
OUR DIESEL ENGINES
FOR THE STATUES.

01:01:13.938 --> 01:01:15.239
I DON'T HAVE
ANY DIESEL ENGINES.

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.907
I DIDN'T SAY YOUR.
 I SAID OUR.

01:01:16.941 --> 01:01:18.375
I GOT
THE DIESEL ENGINE

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:20.010
FOR 2 PLANELOADS
OF LUMBER

01:01:20.044 --> 01:01:21.879
AND 100 PAIRS
OF SHOES
AND THE PARACHUTES.

01:01:21.912 --> 01:01:24.481
I DON'T THINK THE MEN
IN THIS SQUADRON
WILL BE VERY HAPPY

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:25.883
WHEN THEY FIND OUT
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING.

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:28.485
WELL, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE,
DON'T THEY UNDERSTAND?

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.020
WE'RE GONNA COME OUT
OF THIS WAR RICH.

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:31.856
YOU'RE GONNA
COME OUT RICH!

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:34.859
WE'RE GONNA
COME OUT DEAD!

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:36.460
WHAT DOES HE
WANT?

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:37.995
WHO?

01:01:39.496 --> 01:01:41.031
HUNGRY JOE.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.469
WHAT IS THE MATTER?

01:01:45.502 --> 01:01:49.940
I GOT A FEELING...
I THINK IT IS.

01:01:49.974 --> 01:01:50.941
WHAT?

01:01:50.975 --> 01:01:52.076
COME ON.

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:53.077
WHAT IS IT?

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:56.113
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IF IT'S WHAT
I THINK IT IS...

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.922
IT'S JUST McWATT.
I KNOW IT'S JUST McWATT.

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:06.390
THAT BASTARD'S BEEN DOING
THAT TO ME FOR MONTHS.

01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:07.391
HE'S JEALOUS OF HER.

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:09.026
BECAUSE SHE
LIKES YOU BETTER?

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.828
NO, SHE LIKES HIM BETTER.

01:02:10.861 --> 01:02:11.896
THEN WHY DOESN'T SHE
GO OUT WITH HIM?

01:02:11.929 --> 01:02:14.098
SHE CAN'T STAND HIM!

01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:15.833
GOOD OLD McWATT!

01:02:15.866 --> 01:02:17.835
WHAT'S SO GOOD ABOUT HIM?

01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:19.369
HE'S CARRYING ME
ON HIS MANIFEST.

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:22.873
EVERY TIME HE GOES UP,
HE FILES MY NAME
AS A PASSENGER.

01:02:22.907 --> 01:02:24.508
THAT WAY I CAN
GET MY FLIGHT PAY

01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:28.112
WITHOUT HAVING TO DO
ANYTHING STUPID LIKE
GOING UP IN A PLANE.

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:29.446
LOOK!

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:31.882
WHAT IS HE SAYING?

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:35.752
HE'S COMING BACK!

01:02:55.906 --> 01:02:57.141
WHO WAS IT?

01:02:57.174 --> 01:02:59.143
HUNGRY JOE.

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:11.822
I'LL HAVE TO
REQUISITION

01:03:11.856 --> 01:03:14.859
A NEW PHOTOGRAPHER
FROM GROUP.

01:03:14.892 --> 01:03:16.460
IS THERE...

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:18.595
ANYTHING I CAN DO?

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:21.065
McWATT'S STILL UP THERE.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:26.170
DOC DANEEKA'S
UP THERE, TOO.

01:03:26.203 --> 01:03:28.205
I'M RIGHT HERE.

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:31.608
COME ON DOWN,
McWATT.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.510
PROBABLY AFRAID
TO COME DOWN.

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:36.080
HE KNOWS WHAT KIND
OF TROUBLE HE'S IN.

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:39.616
[ENGINE STOPS]

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.551
HE CUT HIS ENGINE.

01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:43.087
McWATT!

01:03:45.622 --> 01:03:47.557
WHY DOESN'T
DANEEKA JUMP?

01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:49.559
HE'S GOT A CHUTE.

01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:51.561
I'M RIGHT HERE,
SERGEANT.

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:53.563
I'M NOT
IN THE PLANE.

01:03:53.597 --> 01:03:55.900
JUMP, DOC! JUMP!

01:03:55.933 --> 01:03:59.236
JUMP. JUMP, DOC.

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:00.237
PLEASE.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.239
JUMP.

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:04.074
JUMP.

01:04:04.108 --> 01:04:05.976
JUMP.

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:20.991
POOR HUNGRY JOE.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.895
POOR McWATT.

01:04:24.929 --> 01:04:26.964
POOR DOC.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.900
YEAH.

01:04:29.934 --> 01:04:31.401
POOR DOC.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:37.908
I'LL NEED A FULL
REPORT ON THIS,
CAPTAIN YOSSARIAN.

01:04:37.942 --> 01:04:39.243
YOSSARIAN?

01:04:39.276 --> 01:04:42.980
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN SOME TIME.

01:04:44.949 --> 01:04:46.917
NOT SINCE...

01:04:48.953 --> 01:04:50.487
SNOWDEN'S FUNERAL.

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:54.024
SNOWDEN.

01:04:56.293 --> 01:04:59.163
AND DO YOU WANT TO
SAY SOMETHING, SIR?

01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:00.998
WHAT?

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:04.668
I JUST WONDERED
IF YOU WANTED
TO SAY ANYTHING.

01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:05.669
NO.

01:05:05.702 --> 01:05:07.304
NO, NO.

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:10.474
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW
THE YOUNG FELLOW.

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:12.476
IT WAS HIS FIRST MISSION.

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:15.012
DID YOU KNOW HIM, DANBY?

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:17.481
NO, I DON'T THINK I
EVER HEARD THE NAME.

01:05:17.514 --> 01:05:19.016
WHAT WAS IT?

01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:20.484
SNOWDEN, I THINK.

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:22.052
OH, YES.

01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:26.690
WELL, I'LL...
I'LL JUST READ SOMETHING.

01:05:26.723 --> 01:05:28.492
YES, YOU...

01:05:28.525 --> 01:05:30.060
YOU DO THAT.

01:05:33.063 --> 01:05:34.498
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

01:05:34.531 --> 01:05:36.033
NO. NO.

01:05:36.066 --> 01:05:38.702
I...JUST THOUGHT
I SAW SOMETHING.

01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:40.537
AHEM.

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:42.706
A NAKED MAN
IN A TREE?

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:44.541
YES, THAT'S IT.

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:51.081
THAT'S JUST
YOSSARIAN.

01:05:52.582 --> 01:05:53.717
OH.

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:55.552
OH.

01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:57.554
WELL, IN THAT CASE...

01:05:59.089 --> 01:06:01.558
"THE LORD IS
MY SHEPHERD."

01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:05.062
"I SHALL NOT WANT.

01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:08.265
HE MAKETH ME
TO LIE DOWN IN
GREEN PASTURES."

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:09.433
HEY!

01:06:11.101 --> 01:06:13.403
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

01:06:13.437 --> 01:06:15.405
YOU SHOULD'VE LOOKED
FOR ME IN THIS TREE.

01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:16.606
I DON'T WANT TO
BUTT IN OR ANYTHING,

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.743
BUT I JUST WONDERED
WHY YOU WEREN'T
WEARING YOUR UNIFORM.

01:06:19.776 --> 01:06:21.711
I DON'T WANNA.

01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:23.347
AHA!

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.349
YOSSARIAN,
DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:28.485
I WANT TO SERVE THIS
TO THE MEN.

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:32.122
TASTE IT
AND LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK.

01:06:34.558 --> 01:06:36.060
WHAT IS IT?

01:06:36.093 --> 01:06:37.627
CHOCOLATE-COVERED
COTTON.

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:39.063
PFFT!

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:40.530
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?

01:06:40.564 --> 01:06:41.565
NO GOOD, HUH?

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:43.100
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE,
YOU DIDN'T TAKE
THE SEEDS OUT!

01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:44.534
IS IT REALLY
THAT BAD?

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:45.335
IT'S COTTON!

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:47.737
THEY'VE GOT TO
LEARN TO LIKE IT!

01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:49.106
WHY?

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:51.541
I CORNERED THE MARKET
IN EGYPTIAN COTTON.

01:06:51.575 --> 01:06:52.542
HOW WAS I
SUPPOSED TO KNOW THERE
WAS GONNA BE A GLUT?

01:06:52.576 --> 01:06:54.811
I'VE GOT 100 WAREHOUSES
STOCKED WITH THIS STUFF

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.113
ALL OVER
THE EUROPEAN THEATER.

01:06:56.146 --> 01:06:57.447
I CAN'T GET RID OF
A PENNY'S WORTH.

01:06:57.481 --> 01:06:58.815
PEOPLE EAT COTTON CANDY,
DON'T THEY?

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.117
WELL, THIS STUFF
IS BETTER.

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:01.385
IT'S MADE OUT
OF REAL COTTON.

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:02.786
MILO, PEOPLE
CAN'T EAT COTTON!

01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:04.588
THEY'VE GOT TO!

01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:06.590
IT'S FOR
THE SYNDICATE!

01:07:06.623 --> 01:07:08.558
IT WILL MAKE THEM SICK!

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:09.826
WHY DON'T YOU
TRY IT YOURSELF IF
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.628
I DID, AND IT
MADE ME SICK.
[GUNSHOTS]

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:13.163
AAAH!

01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:16.600
LOOK AT THAT.

01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:18.268
LOOKS LIKE A FUNERAL.

01:07:18.302 --> 01:07:19.469
THEY'RE BURYING
THAT KID

01:07:19.503 --> 01:07:21.071
THAT GOT KILLED
IN MY PLANE
THE OTHER DAY.

01:07:21.105 --> 01:07:23.607
OH? WHAT
HAPPENED TO HIM?

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.609
HE GOT KILLED.

01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:26.676
[GUNSHOTS]

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:28.078
WHAT?

01:07:28.112 --> 01:07:30.547
I SAID
HE GOT KILLED.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.149
I'M SORRY.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.488
HE WAS YOUR FRIEND?

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:40.524
MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW.

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:43.760
HE WAS VERY OLD.

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:45.762
BUT HE WAS A BOY.

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.431
WELL, HE DIED.

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:50.567
YOU DON'T GET
ANY OLDER THAN THAT.

01:07:59.843 --> 01:08:01.811
WHERE DO YOU WORK?

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:03.880
I'M NOT A WHORE.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:06.283
I DIDN'T SAY
YOU WERE.

01:08:06.316 --> 01:08:08.618
I WORK IN BIG
AMERICAN COMPANY.

01:08:08.652 --> 01:08:10.220
ME, TOO.

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:13.623
YOU'LL SEE ME AGAIN?

01:08:13.657 --> 01:08:14.624
MMM.

01:08:14.658 --> 01:08:15.625
WHY?

01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:17.294
WHY NOT?

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:18.828
YOU THINK
I'M BEAUTIFUL?

01:08:18.862 --> 01:08:20.796
I THINK YOU'RE PERFECT.

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.599
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:23.600
IT IS TRUE.

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:25.100
NO.

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.504

YOU DO NOT
WANT ME NOW?

01:08:48.492 --> 01:08:50.627
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.629
I WANT YOU NOW.

TO MARRY ME.

YOU'RE CRAZY!

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:56.933
WHY AM I CRAZY?

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.502
YOU CAN'T
WANT TO MARRY ME.

01:08:58.535 --> 01:08:59.368
WHY NOT?

01:08:59.403 --> 01:09:00.370
BECAUSE
I'M NOT A VIRGIN.

01:09:00.404 --> 01:09:01.705
WHAT DOES THAT
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:03.907
NOBODY WANTS
TO MARRY A GIRL
WHO'S NOT A VIRGIN.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:06.542
I DO. I WANT TO MARRY YOU.

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:07.544
NOT POSSIBLE.

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:08.545
WHY NOT?

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:09.645
BECAUSE YOU'RE CRAZY.

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:10.880
WHY AM I CRAZY?

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:13.317
BECAUSE YOU
WANT TO MARRY ME.

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:14.951
WAIT. YOU WON'T MARRY ME
BECAUSE I'M CRAZY,

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.752
AND YOU SAY I'M CRAZY
BECAUSE I WANT TO
MARRY YOU, RIGHT?

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:17.754
SI.

01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:18.755
YOU'RE CRAZY.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:20.857
WHY?

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:24.394
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

01:09:24.428 --> 01:09:25.962
TE AMO.
 TE AMO MOLTO.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.665
HOW CAN YOU
LOVE A GIRL

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:30.667
WHO IS NOT
A VIRGIN?

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.669
BECAUSE I CAN'T MARRY YOU.

01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:34.504
WHY YOU CAN'T
MARRY ME?

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:36.673
JUST BECAUSE
I'M NOT VIRGIN?

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:37.674
NO.

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:38.841
BECAUSE YOU'RE CRAZY!

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:39.843
YOU'RE CRAZY.

01:09:39.876 --> 01:09:41.411
YOU'RE CRAZY.

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:42.812
YOU'RE ALL CRAZY!

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.481
WHY ARE WE CRAZY?

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:47.517
BECAUSE YOU
DON'T KNOW HOW
TO STAY ALIVE.

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:49.519
THAT'S THE SECRET
OF LIFE.

01:09:49.553 --> 01:09:52.522
BUT WE HAVE
A WAR TO WIN.

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.858
BUT AMERICA
WILL LOSE THE WAR.

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:56.993
ITALY WILL WIN IT.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.529
AMERICA'S THE STRONGEST
NATION ON EARTH.

01:09:59.563 --> 01:10:02.999
THE AMERICAN FIGHTING MAN
IS THE BEST-TRAINED,

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:05.535
THE BEST-EQUIPPED,
THE BEST-FED...

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:06.903
EXACTLY. ITALY,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:10.006
IS ONE OF THE WEAKEST
NATIONS ON EARTH.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.008
AND THE ITALIAN
FIGHTING MAN

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.010
IS HARDLY EQUIPPED
AT ALL.

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:17.013
THAT'S WHY
MY COUNTRY'S
DOING SO WELL

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:19.816
WHILE YOUR COUNTRY'S
DOING SO POORLY.

01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:21.618
BUT THAT'S JUST SILLY.

01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:23.787
ITALY WAS OCCUPIED
BY THE GERMANS,

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.789
AND IS NOW
OCCUPIED BY US.

01:10:25.822 --> 01:10:27.724
YOU CALL THAT
DOING WELL?

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:29.459
WELL, OF COURSE I DO.

01:10:29.493 --> 01:10:31.995
THE GERMANS
ARE BEING DRIVEN OUT,

01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:33.530
AND WE'RE STILL HERE.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.532
IN A FEW YEARS,
YOU'LL BE GONE,

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:37.667
AND WE WILL
STILL BE HERE.

01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:40.003
YOU SEE, ITALY
IS A VERY POOR,
WEAK COUNTRY,

01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:43.006
AND THAT IS WHAT
MAKES US SO STRONG--

01:10:43.039 --> 01:10:46.009
STRONG ENOUGH
TO SURVIVE THIS WAR

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:48.545
AND STILL BE
IN EXISTENCE

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:52.749
LONG AFTER
YOUR COUNTRY
HAS BEEN DESTROYED.

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:54.384
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:10:54.418 --> 01:10:55.885
AMERICA'S NOT
GOING TO BE DESTROYED.

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:57.654
NEVER?

01:10:58.888 --> 01:10:59.756
WELL...

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:02.492
ROME WAS DESTROYED.
GREECE WAS DESTROYED.

01:11:02.526 --> 01:11:04.628
PERSIA WAS DESTROYED.

01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:06.496
SPAIN WAS DESTROYED.

01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:09.633
ALL GREAT COUNTRIES
ARE DESTROYED.

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:10.734
WHY NOT YOURS?

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:15.839
HOW MUCH LONGER
DO YOU THINK YOUR
COUNTRY WILL LAST?

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.674
FOREVER?

01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:24.748
WELL, FOREVER IS
A LONG TIME, I GUESS.

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.618
VERY LONG.

01:11:28.652 --> 01:11:29.819
Woman: CIAO!

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:33.957
PLEASE, WE'RE TALKING.

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:35.792
WE GO TO BED NOW?

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:38.962
NO. HEY, WOULD YOU
GO PUT SOME CLOTHES ON?

01:11:38.995 --> 01:11:40.830
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY NAKED.

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:42.666
SI.

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:46.803
I WISH SHE WOULDN'T
WALK AROUND LIKE THAT.

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:49.973
BUT IT IS HER BUSINESS
TO WALK AROUND
LIKE THAT.

01:11:50.006 --> 01:11:51.475
IT'S NOT NICE.

01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:53.510
OF COURSE IT'S NICE!

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:56.946
MMM. SHE'S NICE
TO LOOK AT.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.516
THIS LIFE IS NOT NICE.

01:11:59.549 --> 01:12:02.519
I DON'T WANT HER
TO DO THIS.

01:12:02.552 --> 01:12:05.589
WHEN WE GO
TO AMERICA,
NATELY?

01:12:05.622 --> 01:12:07.991
YOU WILL TAKE HER
TO AMERICA?

01:12:08.024 --> 01:12:10.827
AWAY FROM A HEALTHY,
ACTIVE LIFE?

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.997
AWAY FROM
GOOD BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITIES?

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:16.600
AWAY FROM
HER FRIENDS?

01:12:16.633 --> 01:12:18.835
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY PRINCIPLES?

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:20.837
OF COURSE NOT!

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:22.472
NO MORALITY?

01:12:22.506 --> 01:12:24.874
I'M A VERY MORAL MAN...

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:29.613
AND ITALY IS
A VERY MORAL COUNTRY.

01:12:29.646 --> 01:12:33.483
THAT'S WHY WE WILL
CERTAINLY COME OUT
ON TOP AGAIN

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:36.553
IF WE SUCCEED
IN BEING DEFEATED.

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:38.555
YOU TALK LIKE A MADMAN.

01:12:38.588 --> 01:12:41.725
BUT I LIVE
LIKE A SANE ONE.

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:47.531
I WAS A FASCIST WHEN
MUSSOLINI WAS ON TOP.

01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:49.999
NOW THAT HE HAS
BEEN DEPOSED,

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:52.001
I AM ANTIFASCIST.

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:54.538
WHEN THE GERMANS WERE HERE,

01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:57.006
I WAS
FANATICALLY PRO-GERMAN.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.876
NOW I'M FANATICALLY
PRO-AMERICAN.

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:03.880
YOU'LL FIND NO MORE
LOYAL PARTISAN IN ALL OF ITALY

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:06.015
THAN MYSELF.

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:07.350
YOU'RE A SHAMEFUL
OPPORTUNIST.

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:12.489
WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS THAT IT'S BETTER
TO DIE ON YOUR FEET

01:13:12.522 --> 01:13:13.990
THAN TO LIVE
ON YOUR KNEES.

01:13:14.023 --> 01:13:15.825
YOU HAVE IT BACKWARDS.

01:13:15.859 --> 01:13:18.995
IT'S BETTER
TO LIVE ON YOUR FEET

01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:21.631
THAN TO DIE
ON YOUR KNEES.

01:13:21.665 --> 01:13:23.933
I KNOW.

01:13:23.967 --> 01:13:25.569
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:29.673
BECAUSE I AM
107 YEARS OLD.

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:33.877
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:37.914
I'LL BE 20 IN JANUARY.

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:39.949
IF YOU LIVE.

01:13:46.556 --> 01:13:48.792
Woman: CIAO, YOSSARIAN!

01:13:48.825 --> 01:13:49.993
HOW ARE YOU?

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:51.828
WE'VE GOT TO
GO BACK.

01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:54.030
ALL THE LEAVES
HAVE BEEN
CANCELED.

01:13:54.063 --> 01:13:55.532
CIAO,
YOSSARIAN!

01:13:55.565 --> 01:13:57.534
HELLO, HELLO,
MY DEAR.

01:13:57.567 --> 01:13:59.669
YOU GIVE ME
A DOLLAR?

01:13:59.703 --> 01:14:00.537
UH-HUH.

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:03.039
I PAY YOU BACK
WHEN WE
GET TO AMERICA.

01:14:03.072 --> 01:14:04.908
OK, JUST ONE.
ONE!

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.543
GIVE ME THAT!

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:08.044
COME ON, DOBBS.

01:14:08.077 --> 01:14:10.046
MILO'S GOING TO
FLY US BACK.

01:14:10.079 --> 01:14:11.881
WHY ARE
THE LEAVES
CANCELED?

01:14:11.915 --> 01:14:15.919
MILO SAYS THE BASE
IS ON SOME KIND OF ALERT.

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:17.687
OH, YEAH.

01:14:17.721 --> 01:14:20.724
CATHCART RAISED
THE NUMBER OF MISSIONS TO 80.

01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:21.791
80?

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:25.695
HE'S MAD BECAUSE CAPTAIN ORR
LOST ANOTHER AIRPLANE.

01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:26.462
WHERE?

01:14:26.496 --> 01:14:28.532
DITCHED COMING BACK
FROM BOLOGNA.

01:14:28.565 --> 01:14:31.000
WENT DOWN
ON THE MEDITERRANEAN.

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:34.871
AIR SEA RESCUE
OUT THERE?

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:36.540
YEAH.

01:14:36.573 --> 01:14:38.908
THEY PICKED UP
EVERYBODY BUT ORR.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.891
WILL YOU FELLAS
STAY AWAY FROM
THE AIRSTRIP TONIGHT?

01:14:54.924 --> 01:14:57.026
WHAT FOR?

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.563
JUST DO AS I SAY.

01:14:59.596 --> 01:15:01.898
STAY IN YOUR TENTS.

01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:03.733
WHY?

01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:06.936
THERE IT IS!

01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:08.872
WHAT?

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:10.907
ORR'S PLANE.

01:15:12.642 --> 01:15:14.611
HE'LL FIND
HIS WAY BACK.

01:15:14.644 --> 01:15:16.112
HE ALWAYS DOES.

01:15:16.145 --> 01:15:17.747
HE'LL TURN UP.

01:15:17.781 --> 01:15:21.785
HE'LL SNEAK IN WITH
THAT RAT-TOOTHED GIGGLE.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:25.855
AARFY, IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO ME,

01:15:25.889 --> 01:15:28.324
WILL YOU TAKE CARE
OF MY GIRL?

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:30.326
LISTEN TO HIM.
 HISGIRL.

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:31.327
YOSSARIAN?

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.328
DON'T WORRY.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:33.863
NOTHING'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TO YOU

01:15:33.897 --> 01:15:36.933
THAT WON'T HAPPEN
TO THE REST OF US.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:51.948
Yossarian: ORR.

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:54.951
ORR.

01:15:56.953 --> 01:15:58.755
ORR.

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:02.726
ORR.

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.696
I'LL BE THROUGH
IN A MINUTE.

01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:07.897
Yossarian:
NO, YOU WON'T.
YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT.

01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:09.733
EVERY TIME YOU
GO RIGHT AHEAD,

01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:11.901
AND I'VE GOTTA
WATCH YOU FITTING
SOME MICROSCOPIC THING

01:16:11.935 --> 01:16:14.370
INTO THAT MASTERPIECE
OF JUNK YOU'RE ALWAYS
MESSING AROUND WITH.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.773
THEN I GUESS YOU
HAVEN'T SEEN IT?

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:17.473
WHAT?

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:18.942
YOU GUESS
I HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT?

01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:21.678
A LITTLE SQUARE GASKET
ABOUT THIS BIG.

01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:24.748
IT WAS HERE A MINUTE AGO.
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:25.514
NO.

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:27.383
I'LL HAVE TO
START ALL OVER AGAIN.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.385
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:30.186
WHY?

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:33.389
BECAUSE IT GIVES ME
A TERRIBLE PAIN.

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:34.958
WHY?

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:36.392
WHY WHAT?

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.695
WHY WON'T YOU
FLY WITH ME?

01:16:38.728 --> 01:16:39.929
WHAT THE HELL'S
THAT GOT TO DO

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:41.097
WITH THE PAIN
IN MY CHEST

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:43.700
THAT YOU AND YOUR TEENY
BOLTS AND LOUSY GASKETS
GIVE ME?

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:45.401
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:48.705
ARE YOU TRYING TO
TELL ME SOMETHING?

01:16:48.738 --> 01:16:51.407
JUST THAT
IF YOU WERE SMART,
YOU'D FLY WITH ME.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.977
YOU'VE ALREADY
CRACKED UP THREE PLANES.

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:55.411
FOUR.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.413
I'M A GOOD PILOT.

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.415
I DON'T WANT TO END UP
IN THE OCEAN.

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:00.984
YOU COULD THANK ME.

01:17:01.017 --> 01:17:02.652
FOR GETTING THE JOB?

01:17:02.686 --> 01:17:04.053
NO. FOR FINISHING
YOUR STOVE.

01:17:04.087 --> 01:17:04.954
WINTER'S COMING.

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:06.956
YOU'LL HAVE HEAT,
HOT WATER.

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:09.425
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO BOIL EGGS
AND EVERYTHING.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.427
WHERE WILL YOU BE?

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.996
I DON'T KNOW.

01:17:13.029 --> 01:17:14.330
HERE AND THERE.

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:17.433
ORR, THERE ISN'T ANYONE
IN THIS SQUADRON WHO
WANTS TO FLY WITH YOU.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:20.003
YOU'RE A ONE-MAN
DISASTER AREA.

01:17:20.036 --> 01:17:21.404
THEY'RE CRAZY.

01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:24.207
I AGREE WITH THEM.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.742
YOU'RE CRAZY.

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:55.972
ORR?

01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:22.966
ORR?

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.367
ORR?

01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:00.103
HE'S DEAD.

01:19:00.136 --> 01:19:01.204
WHO'S HE?

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.840
NOBODY YOU'D KNOW.
HE'S JUST A KID
FROM MY HOMETOWN.

01:19:03.873 --> 01:19:05.174
HE DIED
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:07.376
THEY CAME ALL THE WAY
FROM THE STATES
TO SEE HIM.

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:08.544
GET IN THE BED,
WILL YOU?

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:09.545
WHAT?

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:12.448
LOOK, HIS MOTHER
AND HIS FATHER
AND HIS BROTHER

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:13.850
FLEW ALL THE WAY HERE.

01:19:13.883 --> 01:19:14.984
THEY KNOW HE'S DYING.

01:19:15.018 --> 01:19:16.085
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

01:19:16.119 --> 01:19:17.353
BE HIM.

01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:19.355
JUST FOR
A FEW MINUTES.

01:19:19.388 --> 01:19:21.324
THEN THEY'LL
GO AWAY.

01:19:21.357 --> 01:19:23.326
THEY CAME
5,000 MILES

01:19:23.359 --> 01:19:25.862
TO SEE YOU
BEFORE YOU DIE.

01:19:25.895 --> 01:19:27.330
I'M NOT DYING!

01:19:27.363 --> 01:19:28.865
WE'RE ALL DYING.

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:29.866
BUT DOC, THEY'LL KNOW!

01:19:29.899 --> 01:19:31.467
THEY CAME HERE
TO SEE THEIR SON!

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.969
THEY'LL HAVE TO TAKE
WHAT THEY CAN GET.

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:34.337
ONE DYING BOY
IS JUST AS GOOD
AS ANOTHER...

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:35.872
OR JUST AS BAD.

01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:37.473
DOC, IT WON'T WORK.

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:38.341
LOOK, THESE PEOPLE
HAVE COME A LONG WAY,

01:19:38.374 --> 01:19:41.577
AND I DON'T WANT TO
DISAPPOINT THEM.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.980
I'M SENTIMENTAL
ABOUT OLD PEOPLE.

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:45.882
WHAT IF THEY
START CRYING?

01:19:45.915 --> 01:19:48.017
THEY PROBABLY WILL
START CRYING.

01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:50.486
I'LL WAIT
RIGHT OUTSIDE
THE DOOR.

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:52.021
IF IT STARTS
GETTING STICKY,

01:19:52.055 --> 01:19:55.024
I'LL COME IN
AND BREAK IT UP.

01:19:55.058 --> 01:19:56.893
