32:58.227 --> 33:01.139
Looks like the man
with the plan
just ran out of options.

33:01.230 --> 33:04.518
Turn yourself in,
and nobody
has to get hurt.

33:04.608 --> 33:05.859
Who the hell
do you think
you are?

33:05.943 --> 33:08.776
Just a guy with
a partner standing
right behind you.

33:12.658 --> 33:13.647
(GRUNTS)

33:14.785 --> 33:15.774
(GROWLING)

33:16.662 --> 33:17.742
(CHOKING)

33:17.830 --> 33:18.819
(SHUSHING)

33:26.422 --> 33:27.411
(GASPS)

33:27.882 --> 33:28.871
(GUNSHOT)

33:31.093 --> 33:32.674
(FLINT GROANING)

33:33.804 --> 33:35.180
I told you to stay put.

33:35.264 --> 33:37.971
You told me that to
make sure I wouldn't,
didn't you?

33:48.903 --> 33:49.892
(SCOFFS)

33:49.987 --> 33:52.023
What's this
supposed to prove?

33:52.907 --> 33:55.819
l've walked through
fire before and
I haven't gotten burned.

33:55.910 --> 33:57.446
You've never
been burned?

34:00.581 --> 34:04.870
l'm indestructible.
I can't feel pain.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.791
Well, you ever suffocate?

34:06.879 --> 34:10.463
'Cause I would imagine,
the air is getting
pretty thin in here.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.085
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

34:13.219 --> 34:14.208
Why are you doing this?

34:14.303 --> 34:16.589
Why do you wanna
stop bad guys?

34:17.598 --> 34:20.055
I told you,
to help people.

34:20.142 --> 34:21.507
That's what you
keep saying,

34:21.602 --> 34:23.467
but I don't believe you.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.387
(GRUNTING)

34:27.483 --> 34:29.474
You know what
water boarding is, Claire?

34:29.568 --> 34:30.557
No.

34:30.653 --> 34:32.393
It's a method of torture.

34:32.488 --> 34:35.946
You're not drowning,
but your body tells
your mind that you are.

34:36.033 --> 34:37.648
You think
you're doing to die.

34:39.036 --> 34:40.492
Trapped, you panic.

34:41.247 --> 34:42.236
(COUGHS)

34:42.331 --> 34:45.368
Trapped. Does that
remind you of anything?

34:46.043 --> 34:47.749
(GASPING)
Stop it. Turn it off.

34:47.836 --> 34:50.122
Is this how it was
with Sylar, huh?

34:50.297 --> 34:52.458
(WHEEZING)
You're indestructible, but you
couldn't get away, right?

34:56.345 --> 34:59.257
Please, stop. I can't.

35:00.683 --> 35:04.642
Why do you want
to stop the bad guys, huh?

35:04.728 --> 35:05.888
To help people.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.934
I don't believe you.
You tell me why.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.561
(COUGHING)

35:11.652 --> 35:16.066
To hurt him, okay?
To hurt him
for what he did.

35:16.490 --> 35:17.730
(GASPING)

35:17.825 --> 35:20.441
Like he hurt me.

35:29.044 --> 35:30.545
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

35:45.185 --> 35:46.140
What do we do now?

35:46.228 --> 35:47.684
While I get him
patched up,

35:47.771 --> 35:51.229
you tell the locals that these
are federal prisoners and
we get them back to Level 5.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.727
Yeah, okay.

36:04.079 --> 36:07.162
Hey! What are you doing?
He's getting away.

36:09.585 --> 36:10.574
(CHOKING)

36:11.795 --> 36:14.127
You were right.
lam just a killer.

36:14.798 --> 36:15.833
No.

36:15.924 --> 36:18.415
No, you don't
have to do this.
She's right.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.220
You don't have to do this.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.895
You can fight it.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.977
No.

36:36.945 --> 36:40.858
I don't think I can.
It's the hunger.

37:07.476 --> 37:09.307
I'm sorry
I tricked you
like that.

37:11.397 --> 37:13.809
ljust did it for
your own good.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.310
Right.

37:20.322 --> 37:23.405
It's only been
a couple of days since
you went through all that.

37:25.786 --> 37:27.697
You got a really
good family.

37:28.330 --> 37:29.490
You got a nice home.

37:29.581 --> 37:30.832
I know.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.419
You're right.

37:34.503 --> 37:37.495
You don'tjust wake up
one day and know
what life's all about.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.459
You know, you got to
build it brick by brick.

37:41.885 --> 37:45.127
And you got to learn
to save yourself before
you can save the world.

37:47.474 --> 37:53.845
There ain't nothing wrong with
just being a 17-year-old girl
for a while. You got that?

37:55.691 --> 37:58.649
Yeah. I got that.

38:00.654 --> 38:01.860
Come here.

38:24.094 --> 38:26.676
Who is she?
What happened to her?

38:27.598 --> 38:30.886
It's your future,
Parkman. Not mine.

38:31.727 --> 38:32.887
Yeah.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.057
We cannot understand
these things.

38:37.566 --> 38:41.058
No, this is it.
This is it. I can feel it.
This is the reason I'm here.

38:42.446 --> 38:47.190
My spirit walk. 80,
that means I can stop that
from happening, right?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.566
You really want to know?

38:53.749 --> 38:54.864
Hmm.

39:07.095 --> 39:10.804
School just called.
Claire didn't show up today.
You know anything about that?

39:10.891 --> 39:13.507
I'm sorry.
You know, ljust thought
that seeing as she's...

39:13.602 --> 39:19.063
You don't get to do that.
Think about Claire.
That's me, not you.

39:19.149 --> 39:22.858
I'm the one who's been here.
Changed her diapers,
checked her spelling.

39:22.945 --> 39:24.276
Me. Not you.

39:24.363 --> 39:25.694
Sandra, I'm not trying
to take your place.

39:25.781 --> 39:29.990
Do you think this is a game?
She just got attacked.

39:30.077 --> 39:31.192
Hurt.
Yeah, that's right.

39:31.286 --> 39:34.073
And she's looking to push
back. And there's nothing
you can do to stop that.

39:34.164 --> 39:38.954
In fact, smothering her,
that's the best way to
drive her away real quick.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.911
Don't you ever assume
you know anything
about me and my daughter.

39:42.005 --> 39:45.623
ljust did
what I thought was best
to keep her here. Safe.

39:46.218 --> 39:47.628
(DOORBELL RINGING)

39:48.220 --> 39:49.676
I got it.

39:53.684 --> 39:55.265
Hey.
Hey, you ready?

39:55.352 --> 39:56.637
One second.

39:56.728 --> 40:01.313
I totally forgot
about the cheerleader
sleepover retreat, I'm sorry.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.016
Is it cool?

40:06.822 --> 40:07.982
Sure.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.533
(DOORBELL RINGING)

40:18.166 --> 40:19.827
Barbara?

40:19.918 --> 40:22.409
No, my name
is Tracy Strauss.

40:23.505 --> 40:25.120
Are you Dr. Zimmerman?

40:25.215 --> 40:26.330
Oh...

40:27.384 --> 40:30.842
The one from Beverly Hills,
huh? Come in.

40:32.014 --> 40:34.346
How do you know
I'm from Beverly Hills?

40:35.851 --> 40:37.011
Do you know me?

40:38.020 --> 40:39.351
Know you?

40:41.356 --> 40:42.892
| created you.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.116
No, I don't think
it's working.

40:58.206 --> 41:01.869
Here. Try this.

41:15.223 --> 41:20.809
MOH/NDER: And as the search
for self continues, we look
for answers everywhere.

41:20.896 --> 41:22.386
In nature.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.560
In God.

41:26.652 --> 41:30.395
In tiny tragedies
that may never
be understood.

41:32.908 --> 41:38.073
But still we are driven to it.
Single-minded, on one goal.

41:38.914 --> 41:41.906
To find our purpose
on this earth.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.580
No matter what
the ramification,

41:48.548 --> 41:50.630
the friendships
that may be hurt

41:53.261 --> 41:56.424
or the deals
with the devil
we need to make.

42:02.104 --> 42:03.093
(DOOR LOCKING)

42:08.819 --> 42:11.435
I guess you were
wrong about me.

42:11.530 --> 42:12.736
We'll see.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.076
Am I being replaced?

42:29.089 --> 42:30.750
Only for a while.

42:31.174 --> 42:36.339
Just until I find
his weakness. And then
I'm gonna kill him.
