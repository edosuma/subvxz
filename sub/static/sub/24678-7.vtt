Narrator:
In New York City war on crime,

00:03.303 --> 00:06.580
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.607 --> 00:08.280
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.288
These are their stories.

00:12.079 --> 00:14.753
( beeping )

00:14.781 --> 00:17.284
- Get a crash cart, stat!
- All right, I'm on it.

00:17.317 --> 00:20.821
Code Blue on Ward 11-B, north block, bed 5!

00:20.854 --> 00:22.629
- Any peripheral pulses?
- No.

00:22.656 --> 00:25.660
V-fib. She has a shockable rhythm.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.865
- Start at 200 joules.
- Charging to 200.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.704
- Clean
- ( thumps )

00:29.730 --> 00:32.904
Alton on post on 11-B, north block.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.606
(sighs)

00:34.635 --> 00:37.343
Better catch your breath,
or we'll need the crash cart for you.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.715
I am so glad I was there
when Mrs. Taylor coded.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.447
Not as glad as she is, I bet.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.648
She's going to be fine.
Dr. Gardetta's going

00:43.677 --> 00:45.953
to keep her sedated with Valium.
Good work, Colleen.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.981
- Looks like you're a hero.
- No, I'm not.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.722
Did you see in the papers?

00:49.750 --> 00:52.526
They're having a book fair
on Third Avenue this Saturday.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.692
Yeah? Well, I'm, you know,

00:54.721 --> 00:56.860
headed out to Sheepshead Bay,
check on my folks.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.268
I'll see you later.

01:02.396 --> 01:06.640
Maintenance to cafeteria annex.
Maintenance to cafeteria annex.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.738
Will you come see our new goldfish, Grandma?

01:08.769 --> 01:11.249
Of course, honey.

01:11.271 --> 01:13.444
Ma, are you all right?

01:13.473 --> 01:15.578
I heard they had an emergency.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.920
Mrs. Taylor. She had a little
thing with her heart.

01:18.946 --> 01:21.256
Okay, kids, let's let Grandma go to sleep.

01:21.281 --> 01:24.194
Goodbye, Grandma. We love you.

01:25.218 --> 01:28.495
I don't know what I would've done if--

01:28.522 --> 01:30.195
Stop staring.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.328
How's your chest feel?

01:33.360 --> 01:36.830
It's better. The doctor says
my lung is healing fine.

01:36.863 --> 01:39.901
I'm going to need some help at
home when they let me out of here.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.776
We'll get one of those home nurses.

01:41.802 --> 01:45.443
- Medicare won't pay for that.
- How do you know that?

01:45.472 --> 01:46.917
You're always so negative.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.443
Can't you come stay with me for a while?

01:49.476 --> 01:52.855
Ma, I've fed your cat and watered
your plants for two weeks already.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.218
Time for your pills.

01:56.249 --> 01:58.661
No, I just want to sleep.

01:58.685 --> 02:01.291
It's all right, dear, you can
take them when you wake up.

02:05.425 --> 02:09.339
Oh, I brought the paperwork
from Cutie Bear to sign.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.971
You know, I think of you

02:14.001 --> 02:17.141
in your apartment all by yourself.

02:17.170 --> 02:20.151
Lenny's things everywhere.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.583
And for the last time,
leave that poor woman alone.

Code Blue on ward 11-B.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.838
Code Blue on ward 11-B, north block, bed 5!

02:46.733 --> 02:50.510
Mrs. Taylor, she's dead.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.484
Do the families know?

02:53.507 --> 02:56.249
No, and they haven't requested autopsies.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.620
Did you advise them against autopsies?

02:58.645 --> 03:00.181
I'm a risk management officer.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.693
I always advise against autopsies.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.525
What about the risk to other patients?

03:04.551 --> 03:08.294
- We have an obligation.
- Our obligation is unclear.

03:08.321 --> 03:11.996
I've asked Ed to advise us
on a course of action.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.902
You need a lawyer to tell you what to do?

03:13.927 --> 03:15.907
Matt, I understand your feelings.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.432
We will deal with this situation ethically,

03:18.465 --> 03:20.536
but we won't fall on our sword.

03:35.515 --> 03:39.053
Hello? I'm calling from Bellmore General.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.123
I want to report a--

03:43.090 --> 03:44.967
I want to report three murders.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.000
( theme music playing )

04:36.309 --> 04:39.813
Your anonymous caller is
grossly misinformed.

04:39.846 --> 04:42.622
It's a statistical anomaly.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.390
Along way from a murder.

04:44.417 --> 04:48.365
- Did you do autopsies on these "anomalies"?
- No.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.595
Toxicology on blood or tissue samples?

04:50.624 --> 04:54.071
If tests were done, the results are
covered by patient confidentiality.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.631
What makes these anomalies anomalous?

04:56.663 --> 04:58.768
All 3 patients were on the surgery ward.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.643
None had been admitted
for life-threatening conditions.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.579
You're saying they were misdiagnosed?

05:03.603 --> 05:05.207
That's not what I said.

05:05.238 --> 05:08.082
Okay, so they...

05:08.108 --> 05:11.351
Developed life-threatening conditions

05:11.378 --> 05:12.880
after they were admitted?

05:12.913 --> 05:15.223
Either way, the hospital's on the hook.

05:16.349 --> 05:18.124
Here are the names of the patients

05:18.151 --> 05:20.153
we got off the 911 call.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.531
We want the addresses of their families.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.729
Then you can fax us the names
of everybody here

05:24.758 --> 05:26.567
who had anything to do with their treatment.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.368
We'll expect it by this afternoon.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.278
We know what a shock this must be for you.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.112
I can't believe...

05:38.138 --> 05:40.641
Anybody would want to hurt her.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.120
We're not sure anybody did.

05:43.143 --> 05:47.489
The only surgery your wife
had was on her knee?

05:47.514 --> 05:50.256
Yes. But then she got an infection

05:50.283 --> 05:52.889
from the cortisone shots.

05:52.919 --> 05:56.093
That's why she was still in the hospital.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.939
Did anything unusual happen to her

06:05.966 --> 06:08.207
before she passed away?

06:09.536 --> 06:12.608
Well, just that afternoon her heart stopped.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.983
She had what they call a Code Blue.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.456
They resuscitated her.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.755
She have a history of heart problems?

06:21.781 --> 06:25.422
Just high blood pressure.
It was under control.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.740
(sniffs)

06:41.468 --> 06:43.971
It's almonds.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.348
Cyanide?

06:50.143 --> 06:53.613
I can tell you already
how it's going to play out.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.183
Angel of death.

06:55.215 --> 06:58.890
Probably not a doctor,
more likely a nurse or an orderly.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.093
Single, late 20s to early 30s,

07:02.122 --> 07:03.897
lives alone or with a parent.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.995
Average to above average intelligence,

07:06.026 --> 07:09.974
narcissistic, immature,
likely to be a screw up on the job--

07:09.996 --> 07:11.475
chronic lateness,

07:11.498 --> 07:13.705
minor errors that would
show up on a work record.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.304
The hospital sent over a list of 114 people

07:16.336 --> 07:19.408
who had one thing or another
to do with the three victims.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.386
Okay. I want to make sure
Mrs. Taylor's not an isolated case.

07:22.409 --> 07:25.618
You're gonna talk to your other families,
you're going to get autopsies.

07:25.645 --> 07:27.283
No problem.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.851
And when you talk to the families,

07:29.883 --> 07:31.556
try to curb your enthusiasm.

07:31.584 --> 07:33.962
I'll curb it when we get this freak
locked in a box.

07:35.121 --> 07:38.102
Poor Lenny. Who would've imagined?

07:38.124 --> 07:41.003
Pulmonary embolism at age 44.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.234
That's according to that city doctor.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.408
You don't believe him?

07:46.433 --> 07:49.778
Lenny was a lot of things,
but he was never sick.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.113
What're you doing?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.178
Just want to make sure it's not all frozen.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.690
What did you want to do, plant tomatoes?

07:59.713 --> 08:01.715
It's for when they put the headstone.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.024
We haven't even ordered one yet.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.656
We know where he is.

08:06.686 --> 08:10.031
Trudy, he was your husband.

08:10.056 --> 08:12.434
At least pretend you're sorry he's gone.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.461
I am sorry.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.440
Let's go before you catch cold.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.370
My husband wasn't supposed to die.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.405
He had his gall bladder removed.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.577
He was a day away from being released.

08:27.607 --> 08:32.818
- Did anything unusual happen to him?
- No.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.985
But the man in the bed next to him,

08:38.018 --> 08:41.328
he had a Code Blue
the day before Aaron died.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.563
But him... they saved.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.264
Excuse me.

08:50.930 --> 08:54.275
Seems like a lot of Code Blues
for a surgery ward.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.548
When there's a Code Blue,

08:58.571 --> 09:00.949
security has to go up
and cover the nurses' station.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.976
Except up on the surgery ward,

09:03.009 --> 09:05.615
you're the only security
that showed up every time.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.318
Doesn't this seem strange to you?

09:07.347 --> 09:09.554
There's not a lot of room
to move around in here.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.789
So any chance I get, I go out on the floors.

09:11.818 --> 09:14.731
So when there's a Code Blue,
you're "Johnny on the spot."

09:14.754 --> 09:16.700
I guess so.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.934
I heard some of these
are worth a lot of money.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.464
You collect them?

09:24.497 --> 09:25.805
No. They're gifts.

09:25.832 --> 09:28.813
From your wife, or your girlfriend?

09:28.835 --> 09:30.371
No, I'm not married.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.780
They're from a nurse.

09:32.772 --> 09:36.515
- She likes you.
- Yeah, she's not really my type.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.045
Is she on the 11th floor?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.285
How'd you know that?

09:40.313 --> 09:42.315
Magic.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.294
So what's this nurse's name?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.127
Derrick's a nice man.

09:49.155 --> 09:50.896
I'm sure he'd never hurt anybody.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.427
He seems to pop up every
time there's a Code Blue.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.066
Is that your Mom's or your Dad's?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.702
- My Dad's.
- You live here alone with him?

10:00.467 --> 10:03.311
Looks like he needs a lot of care.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.349
Is that why you're always late for work?

10:07.373 --> 10:08.818
I'm not always late.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.949
I'll bet your Dad doesn't appreciate

10:12.979 --> 10:15.425
all the effort that you put out.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.621
But they appreciate you at the hospital.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.688
- I don't know about that.
- You save people's lives.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.530
Like James McKee six weeks ago?

10:23.556 --> 10:26.730
When his heart stopped, you called a Code.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.900
I just happened to be there.

10:29.929 --> 10:33.741
And Bruce Sonshein in the same week.

10:38.037 --> 10:39.675
People look up to you.

10:39.706 --> 10:42.346
People like Derrick Alton. It feels nice.

10:43.743 --> 10:47.418
- Yes.
- It makes up for the other looks you get...

10:48.448 --> 10:51.224
When you're late or make a mistake.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.340
What'd you give them, Colleen,

11:03.363 --> 11:05.343
to make their heart stop?

11:05.365 --> 11:07.470
Oh God.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.038
( sobbing )

11:11.070 --> 11:13.311
I gave them adenosine.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.250
- It's a heart medication.
- For rapid heart rate.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.448
But if you give it to someone
with a normal heart rate?

11:17.477 --> 11:20.151
Their heart stops, just
for 20 or 30 seconds.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.218
- It's not lethal.
- But it's enough to call a Code Blue.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.558
Okay, Colleen.

11:30.590 --> 11:33.503
Now tell us what you did
with Aaron Berkowitz,

11:33.526 --> 11:35.437
George Malloy and Jenny Taylor.

11:35.461 --> 11:38.465
- They were poisoned with cyanide.
- I didn't do anything!

11:38.498 --> 11:41.411
Saving people wasn't exciting enough for you.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.141
No, I didn't kill those people.

11:43.169 --> 11:46.275
All I did was give Mrs. Taylor adenosine

11:46.306 --> 11:47.944
just to make her heart stop.

11:47.974 --> 11:51.820
But I did not give her cyanide. I didn't.

11:51.844 --> 11:54.290
You made her heart stop

11:54.314 --> 11:56.089
the afternoon before she died?

11:56.115 --> 11:58.595
Yes, but please,

11:58.618 --> 12:01.428
I didn't kill anybody. I didn't kill her.

12:01.454 --> 12:05.027
Okay, Colleen, stand up.
We’re placing you under arrest.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.164
Is there somebody who can
come take care of your dad?

12:08.194 --> 12:10.674
- My sister.
- Better call her.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.974
I'll call CSU, have them check
the place for cyanide.

12:19.005 --> 12:21.281
She didn't do it. She's not the one.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.484
She lives with her father,
she's a screw up,

12:29.515 --> 12:32.086
she wants attention,
she's all the wonderful things

12:32.118 --> 12:33.859
you said our angel of death would be.

12:33.886 --> 12:37.095
- And she admits inducing 34 Code Blues.
- Yes.

12:37.123 --> 12:40.002
And when she got tired of that,
she graduated to murder.

12:40.026 --> 12:43.132
So why are we having this discussion?

12:44.697 --> 12:47.974
Because once these people
graduate to murder, they don't look back.

12:48.968 --> 12:51.744
She wouldn't have induced
a Code Blue on Jenny Taylor

12:51.771 --> 12:54.274
before poisoning her six hours later.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.048
That wouldn't fit the profile.

12:56.075 --> 12:59.215
And profiling is an art and not a science,

12:59.245 --> 13:00.918
Isn't that so, Detective?

13:02.548 --> 13:06.655
Science didn't find a trace of cyanide
in Colleen Baxton's home.

13:08.855 --> 13:12.428
The ME found partially-digested
gelatin caps containing cyanide

13:12.458 --> 13:14.028
in all three of the victims.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.007
The capsules had the
same color and brand marks

13:17.030 --> 13:19.601
as an over-the-counter
headache medication called Necedrol.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.669
Whoa, I take that stuff.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.305
So do the patients at Bellmore General.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.111
It's what they give them for minor aches.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.744
Nurse Baxton spiked the pills.

13:27.774 --> 13:30.277
I'm telling you, she's not the one.

13:32.545 --> 13:35.116
There's someone else.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.128
Look, tie her to those poison pills.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.221
I'll get the FDA into the loop.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.330
That nurse Colleen brought my boy

13:45.358 --> 13:47.668
those Necedrol pills around noon.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.571
You saw him take them?

13:49.595 --> 13:51.597
Yeah.

13:52.732 --> 13:53.938
Why?

13:53.966 --> 13:57.175
Mr. Malloy, your son died 4 hours later.

13:57.203 --> 14:00.116
Cyanide would've acted quicker than that.

14:05.978 --> 14:08.424
Your son was in a motorcycle accident.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.325
He must've been
in a lot of pain.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.421
He complained they weren't
giving him enough pills.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.329
I talked to the nurses about it,

14:14.354 --> 14:17.392
but they said they couldn't do anything
without the doctor's okay.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.733
It must've been tough for you
to see him like that.

14:19.759 --> 14:22.399
Yeah.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.874
You wanted to do something for him.

14:24.897 --> 14:28.538
You gave him some extra pills--

14:28.568 --> 14:30.912
some Necedrol-- that afternoon?

14:30.937 --> 14:33.543
- Yeah.
- Where did you get them?

14:35.375 --> 14:38.879
At the drugstore across
the street from the hospital.

14:38.911 --> 14:41.824
- I bought a bottle.
- Do you still have it?

14:41.848 --> 14:43.953
Yeah.

14:47.653 --> 14:51.157
For once, I was really
hoping you were wrong.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.297
I told him I didn't see nobody

14:56.329 --> 14:58.741
fooling with Mrs. Taylor's medication.

14:58.765 --> 15:01.109
Why do you think they were asking?

15:01.134 --> 15:02.477
Why do you think, Ma?

15:02.502 --> 15:05.210
Probably somebody did
something to Mrs. Taylor.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.149
Oh my God.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.653
It could've been you. Just think about that.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.485
Oh, you look tired.
Why don't you go sit down?

15:12.512 --> 15:15.356
There's a chair in front
of the prescription counter.

15:15.381 --> 15:17.122
I don't know why we had to come here.

15:17.150 --> 15:20.393
There's a perfectly good drugstore
just around the corner from me.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.026
The prices are better here. Now go sit down.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.126
- I'll be done in a minute.
- All right.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.813
Yes, any cyanide deaths in the last 3 months.

15:45.845 --> 15:48.587
Look, anything comes up,
you let us know pronto.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.993
Looks like he's getting
the crap pounded out of him.

15:52.018 --> 15:55.431
Here it comes, Necedrol headache number 14.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.834
Yes, that's right, death by cyanide.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.701
No, we're not kidding.

16:00.726 --> 16:03.172
Yes, Goren, Major Case Squad. Call me.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.506
- We hear from the lab yet on that bottle?
- No.

16:05.531 --> 16:08.512
Upstairs has a theory. Want to hear it?

16:08.534 --> 16:10.605
On her lunch break one day,
Nurse Colleen Baxton

16:10.636 --> 16:12.513
walks across the street to the drugstore

16:12.538 --> 16:15.178
and plants a couple of hot pills
in a bottle of Necedrol.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.348
What do you want me to say? it's brilliant.

16:18.377 --> 16:21.017
They want you to look at the nurse again.

16:21.047 --> 16:23.459
And they want me to shut down the phone bank.

16:24.550 --> 16:25.961
What, are they insane?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.261
They're worried we're going to start a panic.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.291
A panic might save lives.
They have any idea what they're dealing with?

16:31.324 --> 16:34.897
- It's terrorism. Everyone's a
potential victim.
- Okay, got it. Thanks.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.804
Over at the 2-7 in Midtown,

16:36.829 --> 16:40.003
22-year-old female. Cyanide
poisoning 6 days ago.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.614
Jeanine King was out
dancing with her boyfriend.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.278
They get home, he passes out.

16:49.308 --> 16:52.050
Next morning he trips
over her on his way to the john.

16:52.078 --> 16:55.184
Tox screen came back positive for cyanide.

16:55.214 --> 16:57.785
So our gut reaction was go for the boyfriend.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.524
How'd he get his hands on cyanide?

16:59.552 --> 17:01.998
That's the thing. The kid's
just a bike messenger.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.434
With no access to a chemical
supply house or university lab.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.597
If he wanted to kill the girl,
it'd be easier for him

17:07.627 --> 17:10.164
to crack her over the head
with his tire pump.

17:10.195 --> 17:13.040
- What came up in the search?
- Nothing yet.

17:13.065 --> 17:16.672
So are you going to tell us where to look,
or do we have to play 20 questions?

17:20.306 --> 17:21.614
The medicine cabinet.

17:22.909 --> 17:26.823
- We got a nut job out there?
- You didn't hear it from us, but yeah.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.848
Someone's spiking tablets of Necedrol.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.919
Oh really? Okay, two questions:

17:31.951 --> 17:33.988
How long have you known about this?

17:34.020 --> 17:37.194
and just when were you planning to
share it with the rest of the world?

17:37.223 --> 17:39.362
That's up to the commissioner's office.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.030
Those idiots.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.937
But if it were to leak out,

17:44.964 --> 17:47.410
it wouldn't be a bad thing.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.315
The lab found 2 cyanide-tainted capsules

17:52.338 --> 17:54.750
in the Necedrol bottle
in Jeanine King's bathroom.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.846
The tox exam turned up both cyanide
and Necedrol in her system.

17:57.877 --> 18:01.051
The boyfriend said they bought
the bottle of Necedrol in the city

18:01.080 --> 18:03.526
3 weeks ago, before the
deaths at the hospital.

18:03.549 --> 18:05.722
Toss in the bottle Mr. Malloy
bought for his son,

18:05.751 --> 18:07.731
we got a product tamperer out there.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.927
I'll run this up so they can contact
the manufacturers about a recall.

18:10.957 --> 18:14.336
We're keeping a lid on this.
The last thing we need is public hysteria.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.170
- (phone rings)
- Deakins.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.506
No, sir.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.876
Call you back.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.783
Sources inside the 27th precinct said

18:26.806 --> 18:29.685
the 22-year-old victim
took two Necedrol capsules

18:29.709 --> 18:31.154
minutes before her death.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.088
The sources also told News Channel 4

18:33.112 --> 18:35.285
the death might be related to recent deaths

18:35.314 --> 18:38.488
at Bellmore General Hospital. Linda Mc--

18:38.517 --> 18:40.463
Who the hell opened their big yaps?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.499
(phone rings)

18:44.523 --> 18:45.763
Deakins.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.572
Hold him for a second. What?

18:52.598 --> 18:55.272
Phone canvass turned up 2 more cyanide deaths.

18:57.737 --> 18:58.909
(sighs)

19:01.540 --> 19:05.386
The FDA turned up 10
bottles of tainted Necedrol.

19:05.411 --> 19:07.482
The green dots show

19:07.513 --> 19:10.153
where the original bottles

19:10.182 --> 19:12.321
were purchased by the tamperer.

19:12.351 --> 19:15.161
The blue dots show where each bottle

19:15.187 --> 19:17.963
was purchased by the victims.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.335
We fed this stuff into
geographic profiling program.

19:22.461 --> 19:26.273
We start with the "least effort" principle.

19:26.298 --> 19:29.211
Most people who run out
for a gallon of milk,

19:29.235 --> 19:32.409
they go to the store nearest home.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.817
Criminals work the same
way, but out of caution,

19:35.841 --> 19:38.117
they keep a buffer zone around their home.

19:38.144 --> 19:39.623
This is the buffer zone.

19:39.645 --> 19:41.955
Outside that is the strike zone.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.621
And here... is the hot zone.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.824
A 3-block area where the tamperer lives.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.732
Have you identified any possible suspects?

19:50.756 --> 19:54.397
We fed the addresses of hospital employees,

19:54.427 --> 19:57.772
the six victims' families and close friends

19:57.797 --> 20:01.244
and present and past employees

20:01.267 --> 20:04.646
of the Necedrol manufacturer
into the program.

20:04.670 --> 20:07.014
There're no matches.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.813
This program is reliable.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.846
The killer lives in the hot zone.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.883
Thank you, Detective. You can leave us now.

20:23.422 --> 20:26.062
Now, Captain, you started working off

20:26.092 --> 20:28.333
another of Goren's profiles.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.863
We had a shrink look at Colleen Baxton.

20:30.896 --> 20:34.002
She was a hop, skip and a
jump from going lethal.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.274
Goren's profile saved lives.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.873
And meanwhile, the person who was lethal

20:38.904 --> 20:40.850
was operating with impunity.

20:40.873 --> 20:44.878
We're getting a thousand
phone calls per hour.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.255
Nobody knows how much
of this poison there is out there.

20:48.280 --> 20:52.251
You should've conducted
a two-track investigation.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.355
My point, sir, is however
many tracks we have,

20:54.386 --> 20:56.866
we will catch this hump. That's a promise.

20:58.190 --> 21:01.171
I'm concerned because I think my husband

21:01.193 --> 21:04.436
may have taken Necedrol before he died.

21:04.463 --> 21:07.137
A month ago.

21:07.166 --> 21:10.113
I guess it would be okay to dig him up.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.418
No, I can come down to your office.

21:14.440 --> 21:18.115
Can I ask you, how long
would a lawsuit take?

21:19.812 --> 21:21.689
Well, I'm not really the kind of person

21:21.714 --> 21:24.593
who goes around suing people,
it's just that Lennie,

21:24.617 --> 21:27.120
he'd want me provided for.

21:28.487 --> 21:30.592
The FDA analyzed the cyanide--

21:30.623 --> 21:32.000
it's all from the same batch,

21:32.024 --> 21:34.436
but they're still trying to get a line
on where it came from.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.566
- I put out the word to my own sources.
- What sources?

21:37.596 --> 21:41.169
Watchdog groups who keep track of
shipments of dangerous chemicals.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.010
- Tree huggers.
- Might be helpful to get a line on a motive.

21:44.036 --> 21:47.848
We haven't found anybody with a motive
against any of the 6 victims.

21:47.873 --> 21:50.319
What about the great American pastime?

21:50.342 --> 21:53.482
Which one, dieting or
cheating on your taxes?

21:53.512 --> 21:55.788
Suing.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.120
So far, our nationwide recall's

22:00.152 --> 22:02.098
costing us tens of millions of dollars.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.727
Not to mention the cost
of redesigning our packaging.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.430
Anyone file a suit against you?

22:06.458 --> 22:10.565
9 lawsuits so far. We plan to
settle them as quickly as possible.

22:10.596 --> 22:12.735
You said 9 lawsuits?

22:12.765 --> 22:15.609
2 class-action suits,
but those are non-starters,

22:15.634 --> 22:18.114
plus the suits by the families
of the 7 victims.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.912
7? We only know of 6!

22:19.939 --> 22:21.612
So did we until a couple of days ago.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.177
Leonard Pomeranski of Manhattan.

22:24.210 --> 22:26.918
Died of cyanide poisoning 5 weeks ago.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.252
Why did it take 5 weeks to hear about it?

22:31.283 --> 22:34.059
Mr. Pomeranski was originally diagnosed

22:34.086 --> 22:36.066
as having died of a pulmonary embolism.

22:36.088 --> 22:39.331
When the tampering story broke,
his widow had his body exhumed.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.271
An autopsy found cyanide

22:42.294 --> 22:44.706
mixed with Necedrol in his system.

22:44.730 --> 22:48.143
If we can be helpful in any other way,
please let us know.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.113
You bet.

22:52.638 --> 22:54.675
Thanks for coming in.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.615
Pomeranski doesn't live in the hot zone.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.288
He was the first to die,
first to be poisoned.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.731
Somebody had to be first.

23:09.755 --> 23:13.498
As Leonard Pomeranski might say...

23:13.525 --> 23:15.869
"Why me?"

23:15.895 --> 23:18.375
I know you're very selective
about your franchisees.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.206
This is the second time I've applied.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.076
I see your boutique experience is a little--

23:23.102 --> 23:25.514
Lacking, I know. But I have learned so much

23:25.537 --> 23:27.642
about children's clothes working at Macy's.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.516
I've been taking business classes.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.817
May I speak frankly, Ms. Pomeranski?

23:31.844 --> 23:35.018
I'm quite concerned about financing.

23:35.047 --> 23:38.654
Now despite the fact that you had
someone co-sign for the credit--

23:38.684 --> 23:40.527
Oh, that's not a problem.

23:40.552 --> 23:43.362
See, I'm expecting a large check
at the end of the month.

23:43.389 --> 23:45.494
It's a settlement from a lawsuit.

23:45.524 --> 23:48.232
It means I can make the entire
first year's license payment

23:48.260 --> 23:50.035
as soon as I get that check.

23:52.698 --> 23:56.168
I'm going to send your application
upstairs for further review,

23:56.201 --> 23:58.943
and we will be in touch
with you very shortly.

24:01.407 --> 24:05.480
The thing is, I knew it wasn't
a pulmonary embolism.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.821
With Lennie, it was like he ate something

24:07.846 --> 24:10.554
that didn't agree with him,
like a had heartburn.

24:10.582 --> 24:13.290
He went back to lie down
and he never got back up.

24:13.319 --> 24:16.459
I called 911 right away,
but it was too late.

24:18.691 --> 24:19.897
What're they doing?

24:19.925 --> 24:22.531
It's standard. All the
victim's homes got searched.

24:22.561 --> 24:25.542
How did you know your husband
took the Necedrol?

24:25.564 --> 24:26.634
Did you see him?

24:26.665 --> 24:30.112
No, but I remember he had a bad headache
when he got home from work.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.274
The drugstore where you
bought the Necedrol,

24:32.304 --> 24:34.181
it's not exactly around the corner.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.482
They have better prices over there.

24:36.508 --> 24:39.751
I noticed that there's
no pictures of you and your husband.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.720
We didn't like taking pictures.

24:42.748 --> 24:44.819
Lennie always thought he looked too fat.

24:44.850 --> 24:47.922
Wedding pictures?
I like looking at wedding pictures.

24:47.953 --> 24:50.934
I threw them all out. It was too depressing.

24:50.956 --> 24:52.594
I don't like to dwell.

24:52.624 --> 24:55.002
Right. You got to move on with your life.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.166
Yes.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.176
That's a franchise operation.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.341
I thought you worked in a department store.

25:05.371 --> 25:07.476
I do.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.713
It's just something I'm thinking about.

25:09.742 --> 25:11.619
More getting on with your life?

25:11.643 --> 25:13.247
Yeah, like that.

25:13.278 --> 25:15.724
With all the bad memories,

25:15.748 --> 25:17.489
you'll probably want to move soon.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.827
Oh, no. This place is rent-controlled.

25:25.391 --> 25:27.837
Yes, both sides of the application.

25:27.860 --> 25:31.069
I understand. As soon as possible. Thank you.

25:31.096 --> 25:33.406
No trace of cyanide in her apartment.

25:33.432 --> 25:36.777
- Something here stinks.
- Too bad it's not almonds.

25:36.802 --> 25:39.510
(pager beeps)

25:41.006 --> 25:42.815
What do you know, a tree hugger.

25:44.476 --> 25:46.387
The way the FDA works,

25:46.412 --> 25:48.449
they call up the chemical companies and say,

25:48.480 --> 25:50.289
"Hey, did you ship any cyanide lately?"

25:50.315 --> 25:52.852
- No? Okay, thanks.
- How do you work?

25:52.885 --> 25:55.491
Hey, the baby can sign. It's his ocean, too.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.626
Didn't Bobby tell you?

25:57.656 --> 26:00.159
We got alternative methods
of gathering information.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.069
You hack into the companies' computers?

26:02.094 --> 26:04.870
- If you're going to make it sound illegal --
- What'd you find?

26:04.897 --> 26:08.276
A company in the lovely state of
Oklahoma shipped 10 ounces of cyanide

26:08.300 --> 26:10.371
to a photo supply store in the West Village.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.109
- Are you sure?
- What's the big deal?

26:12.137 --> 26:15.016
They stopped using cyanide
for photo processing 10 years ago.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.452
That was the first tip-off.
Second one was the cyanide

26:17.476 --> 26:19.979
was shipped 2 weeks before
people started dying.

26:20.012 --> 26:22.686
- What store?
- Marlon's Camera.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.751
But they went out of business 2 years ago.

26:24.783 --> 26:27.627
Post office had the forwarding address.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.635
480 West 12th Street.

26:32.658 --> 26:34.695
Right smack in the hot zone.

26:36.695 --> 26:39.301
- Who is it?
- I'm a police officer, ma'am.

26:39.331 --> 26:42.335
There's an emergency.
I need access to your apartment.

26:42.367 --> 26:45.211
( door unlocks )

26:45.237 --> 26:48.081
What's going on here? What emergency?

26:48.107 --> 26:50.087
This is. It's a search warrant.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.199
This is a search for what?

27:02.221 --> 27:05.065
A package of dangerous chemicals
was mailed to this address.

27:05.090 --> 27:08.196
Well, I don't know anything about that.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.865
Marlon Camera Supply. Is this you?

27:09.895 --> 27:12.774
That was my husband's store.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.869
He passed away two years ago.

27:14.900 --> 27:18.211
- Are you Loretta Marlon?
- Yes.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.945
Your Percocet-- had an operation lately?

27:20.973 --> 27:22.475
Yeah, two weeks ago.

27:22.508 --> 27:24.351
Bellmore General?

27:26.378 --> 27:29.188
- Mrs. Marlon?
- Who's this?

27:29.214 --> 27:30.921
Why, that's my daughter.

27:32.117 --> 27:34.154
Trudy Pomeranski.

27:39.625 --> 27:43.368
They already asked me at the hospital
about Mrs. Taylor.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.500
I told them, I don't know anything.

27:45.531 --> 27:48.444
Did you or your daughter ever
visit Mr. Berkowitz?

27:48.467 --> 27:50.947
- He was five doors down from you.
- No.

27:52.404 --> 27:55.112
But Trudy went to the drugstore

27:55.140 --> 27:56.585
across the street, right?

27:56.608 --> 27:58.815
To get some magazines
and some candy?

27:58.844 --> 28:00.721
- No.
- Are you sure?

28:00.746 --> 28:03.283
- Because we heard somebody saw her there.
- Not her.

28:03.315 --> 28:06.592
And she was seen in the Dwyer's

28:06.618 --> 28:08.393
on Eighth and Broadway.

28:08.420 --> 28:11.094
That's where Jeanine King...

28:11.123 --> 28:15.503
Bought her Necedrol that killed her.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.632
Susan Cassadine,

28:17.663 --> 28:21.201
she got hers at the ShopRite
at Seventh and Waverly.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.144
And Ninette Wong's daughter bought them

28:23.168 --> 28:26.672
at the Gaydose's near Union Square.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.015
And then your son-in-law, Leonard.

28:31.977 --> 28:34.355
All these innocent people dead

28:34.379 --> 28:36.484
because they took the cyanide

28:36.515 --> 28:39.155
the chemical company
shipped to your address.

28:39.184 --> 28:41.130
No.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.901
When you were in the hospital,

28:51.930 --> 28:54.877
who took care of your cat and your flowers?

28:54.900 --> 28:58.609
It was Trudy, right?

29:00.138 --> 29:04.086
And she planted all those tainted bottles

29:04.109 --> 29:06.646
while she was coming and
going from your place.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.889
Look at them, Mrs. Marlon.

29:15.921 --> 29:19.425
Don't these people's families
have a right to know what happened?

29:19.458 --> 29:22.667
You could tell them. It's
the decent thing to do.

29:24.963 --> 29:27.500
I'm sorry.

29:27.532 --> 29:30.035
I don't know anything.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.084
Trudy did this.

29:39.544 --> 29:42.821
I know it, Detective Eames knows it...

29:43.849 --> 29:45.556
You know it.

29:45.584 --> 29:48.588
We'll talk to the DA.
We'll make sure she's not hurt.

29:48.620 --> 29:52.261
There's a whole machine out
there waiting to chew her up.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.100
You have it in your power to save her.

29:54.126 --> 29:57.369
I want someone to help me! I want a lawyer.

30:04.069 --> 30:06.640
Where's the evidence
this package was even delivered?

30:06.672 --> 30:08.811
You said yourself it was
sent to an old address.

30:08.840 --> 30:12.219
As soon as the company finds the signed
receipt, we'll have the evidence.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.780
Oh for God's sakes, Ron.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.985
You think this old lady
with one and a half lungs

30:16.014 --> 30:18.858
ran around the hospital
like some tooth fairy from hell?

30:18.884 --> 30:22.661
No, but her daughter probably did,
and your client is covering for her.

30:22.688 --> 30:24.429
Then subpoena her. In the meantime,

30:24.456 --> 30:27.926
she's not under arrest.
I'm taking her home. See ya.

30:34.399 --> 30:36.640
Quite a pistolero.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.841
Question is how tough is her client?

30:39.838 --> 30:42.682
We might get her to talk
two or three months from now.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.187
Oh.

30:44.209 --> 30:47.247
She shut down in there. She's in shock.

30:47.279 --> 30:49.350
The idea that her daughter

30:49.381 --> 30:51.554
is responsible for 7 murders--

30:51.583 --> 30:53.221
It's too horrible to contemplate.

30:53.251 --> 30:56.164
We can't afford to wait for 3 months.

30:58.890 --> 31:00.961
The FDA planning a second look

31:00.992 --> 31:02.938
at Trudy Pomeranski's apartment?

31:02.961 --> 31:05.271
Yeah, we're also bringing in
the FBI lab as a backup.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.709
Let's keep our fingers crossed.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.975
I feel had for Mrs. Marlon.

31:11.002 --> 31:13.107
She reminds me of my grandma.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.517
You going to share with
the rest of the class?

31:17.542 --> 31:20.682
It's a fax from Cutie Bear Baby Clothes.

31:20.712 --> 31:24.455
Trudy Pomeranski filled out
this application for a franchise.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.553
And this is the contract she signed.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.362
It's a $100,000 bucks to buy in.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.266
Funny how she can afford it now.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.462
Here's your motive.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.997
Trudy killed 6 innocent people

31:38.029 --> 31:41.033
to hide the fact she killed her
husband for the lawsuit money.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.910
You can lay that motive on everybody
who's suing the drug company.

31:43.935 --> 31:46.006
Still doesn't get you past square one.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.252
Baby clothes?

31:54.279 --> 31:56.953
The contract has a morals clause.

31:56.982 --> 32:00.225
"If a franchisee causes, by whatever means,”

32:00.252 --> 32:03.062
“negative publicity for,
or associations with,”

32:03.088 --> 32:06.501
“the Cutie Bear brand, this
will constitute a material breach”

32:06.525 --> 32:08.436
“and the company may terminate the contract”

32:08.460 --> 32:10.462
“without prejudice or compensation.”

32:15.667 --> 32:17.669
Detective?

32:17.702 --> 32:20.376
Get an indictment against the mother.

32:20.405 --> 32:22.316
For what? Murder.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.411
With what? With whatever.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.889
Don't you have the grand jury
eating out of your hand?

32:26.912 --> 32:28.653
I bet you could indict that clock.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.253
I must be losing my mind.
Didn't we just agree the daughter did it?

32:32.284 --> 32:34.958
Trust me. We start with the mother.

32:36.321 --> 32:37.527
Isn't it great?

32:37.556 --> 32:39.160
My office'll be over there.

32:39.191 --> 32:42.365
The company has this policy-- they
won't take back what you can't sell.

32:42.394 --> 32:45.773
But I already made this closeout deal with
this department store in Puerto Rico.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.141
So you see, Ma, I haven't even opened yet

32:48.166 --> 32:49.873
and I'm already in profit.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.938
You haven't heard one word I've said.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.883
Trudy, they think you killed people.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.819
If that was true, I'd be in jail.

32:57.843 --> 33:00.585
Anyway, I didn't do anything.
So don't worry about it.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.853
Trudy...

33:02.881 --> 33:04.952
Did you use Dad's old account

33:04.983 --> 33:07.486
to order cyanide from that chemical company?

33:07.519 --> 33:11.524
No. Look at these clothes.
They're so cute.

33:11.556 --> 33:13.968
How-- how much is all this costing?

33:13.992 --> 33:15.665
The settlement money's taking care of it.

33:15.694 --> 33:18.402
Would you quit worrying
and just be happy for me?

33:20.332 --> 33:22.141
Trudy, what have you done?

33:22.167 --> 33:24.773
Ma, don't talk like that.

33:24.803 --> 33:27.113
Did you kill Lennie?

33:27.138 --> 33:29.675
- They feel so soft.
- Answer me!

33:29.708 --> 33:33.087
You are so negative!
You always think the worst of me.

33:33.111 --> 33:37.423
The only reason I married Lennie was
so that you wouldn't think I was a
slut for sleeping with him.

33:37.449 --> 33:40.896
You never cared what I wanted.
Now I've got what I want, Ma,

33:40.919 --> 33:43.126
and I'm not going to let you spoil it for me.

33:51.997 --> 33:53.874
This hospital record,

33:53.899 --> 33:56.072
People's Grand Jury exhibit 4...

33:58.503 --> 34:02.144
Reflects the fact that Mrs. Marlon
was on the ward at the same time

34:02.173 --> 34:04.813
as victims 2 and 3 were poisoned

34:04.843 --> 34:08.552
and that she shared a room
with victim number 4.

34:08.580 --> 34:12.118
That concludes the People's evidence.

34:12.150 --> 34:15.688
- Yes?
- Is there any evidence at all

34:15.719 --> 34:17.791
that she tampered with those bottles?

34:17.822 --> 34:19.529
As your legal adviser,

34:19.558 --> 34:23.199
I'm telling you that is not relevant
to your deliberations.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.208
Ladies and gentlemen of the grand jury,

34:25.230 --> 34:29.679
let me remind you that the appropriate
standard of law to be applied here

34:29.701 --> 34:32.476
is "legally sufficient evidence

34:32.504 --> 34:35.917
and reasonable cause to believe."

34:35.940 --> 34:39.388
I will leave you to deliberate
and vote in this case.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.601
I'm going to ask you
to trust me on this one.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.740
Thank you.

35:09.074 --> 35:11.111
( buzzing )

35:11.142 --> 35:13.588
Here we go.

35:21.686 --> 35:23.097
Sir.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.761
Thank you.

35:28.159 --> 35:30.639
From a wink, to a nod,

35:30.662 --> 35:33.700
to an indictment.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.678
Docket number 709501,

35:35.700 --> 35:37.737
People v. Loretta Marlon.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.840
7 counts of murder in the first degree.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.475
How do you plead, Mrs. Marlon?

35:44.376 --> 35:46.151
Mrs. Marlon?

35:52.384 --> 35:54.364
All right. Miss O’Brien, we will enter

35:54.386 --> 35:57.162
a plea of not guilty for your client,
if that will work for you?

35:57.188 --> 35:59.634
- It does. Thank you, Judge.
- People on bail?

35:59.658 --> 36:02.070
In light of the severity of these crimes,

36:02.093 --> 36:03.834
we ask for remand, Your Honor.

36:03.862 --> 36:06.866
In light of the weakness
of their evidence, remand's absurd.

36:06.898 --> 36:09.310
The evidence passed muster
with the grand jury.

36:09.334 --> 36:12.611
Right. Was my client indicted
before or after the ham sandwich?

36:12.637 --> 36:14.139
Very amusing, Miss O’Brien.

36:14.172 --> 36:18.177
Your client is remanded without bail. Next!

36:18.209 --> 36:22.180
Docket number 734916.

36:22.213 --> 36:23.988
People v. Louis.

36:24.015 --> 36:27.758
That's docket number 734916.

36:29.054 --> 36:30.829
You're absolutely sure?

36:30.855 --> 36:32.334
This is her mother.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.394
I don't want to tell you your business,

36:34.426 --> 36:38.101
but if it gets out that Trudy
bought one of your franchises,

36:38.129 --> 36:41.702
Cutie Bear's going to become
Cyanide Bear to most people.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.805
It's just something to think about.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.338
Have a good day.

36:50.041 --> 36:53.079
I don't understand. I have all the
money I need from the settlement.

36:53.111 --> 36:55.022
Yes, but that's not the issue.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.993
Section 16 of the Standard Terms.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.723
The Morals Clause.

36:59.751 --> 37:03.164
If a franchisee causes negative
publicity for the Cutie Bear brand,

37:03.188 --> 37:05.225
the company may void the contract.

37:05.256 --> 37:06.929
But I haven't done anything wrong.

37:06.958 --> 37:09.939
Your mother is charged with 7 murders.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.874
That doesn't have anything to do with me.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.434
Unfortunately, it does.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.175
People will find out who your mother is.

37:18.203 --> 37:20.410
We sell baby clothes.

37:20.438 --> 37:24.818
Baby clothes cannot be associated in
the public mind with a cyanide killer.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.481
But my mother didn't do it.

37:26.511 --> 37:29.617
And we will wait until
there's a final disposition.

37:29.647 --> 37:32.059
But unless she's cleared,

37:32.083 --> 37:33.926
the company will have no choice

37:33.952 --> 37:37.263
but to void your franchise agreement.

37:37.288 --> 37:38.790
I'm sorry.

37:50.902 --> 37:53.940
(squealing, grunting)

37:53.972 --> 37:56.009
( sobbing )

38:01.980 --> 38:05.325
This is just so awful and so unfair.

38:05.350 --> 38:07.557
Please, have a seat.

38:07.585 --> 38:10.293
My mother never hurt
anybody in her whole life.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.730
Sometimes, people do things

38:15.760 --> 38:17.762
when they get old and they're alone.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.800
But she wasn't alone. She had me.

38:20.832 --> 38:23.540
She can't have done this. She's innocent.

38:23.568 --> 38:26.310
Well, no. See, Mrs. Pomeranski,

38:26.337 --> 38:28.874
we have a lot of good evidence against her--

38:28.907 --> 38:31.478
the cyanide that was sent to her house,

38:31.509 --> 38:33.386
the fact that she was in the hospital

38:33.411 --> 38:35.914
when those people were killed.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.188
She hasn't exactly been jumping up and down

38:38.216 --> 38:40.662
saying that she's innocent.
You saw her in court.

38:40.685 --> 38:42.961
Innocent people don't act like that.

38:42.987 --> 38:46.230
She looked guilty. Even the DA said so.

38:46.257 --> 38:48.760
But she had no reason to do this.

38:48.793 --> 38:52.707
Maybe she got angry about
the tumor in her lung.

38:52.730 --> 38:56.507
Maybe she decided to take it out
on the drug companies.

38:56.534 --> 38:59.777
Or maybe she just didn't like Lennie--

38:59.804 --> 39:02.114
didn't like the way he treated you.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.711
No, Lennie treated me fine.

39:04.742 --> 39:06.813
Ma got along with him.

39:06.845 --> 39:10.588
Or maybe she felt sorry for you,

39:10.615 --> 39:12.595
she wanted to help you...

39:12.617 --> 39:15.029
Uh, to create a situation
where you could make money

39:15.053 --> 39:18.000
suing the drug company.
You think that's possible?

39:18.022 --> 39:20.559
Ma's not that smart to think of that.

39:20.592 --> 39:23.163
Well, whatever the reason...

39:25.630 --> 39:28.611
There's just no way
she's not going to jail for this.

39:28.633 --> 39:32.410
But she didn't do it.
Can't you see? It's not possible.

39:33.471 --> 39:36.077
I'm sure you believe that,

39:36.107 --> 39:39.384
but we can only go by what's in front of us.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.020
Now, we could be wrong.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.624
Someone could walk in here tomorrow
and say they did it.

39:51.656 --> 39:54.159
Does that happen?

39:54.192 --> 39:57.401
Not a lot. But it's probably
more likely in a case like this.

39:57.428 --> 39:59.908
Why? What do you mean?

39:59.931 --> 40:02.411
Well, people who commit this kind of crime,

40:02.433 --> 40:04.106
they want attention.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.843
If they see someone else getting the credit,

40:06.871 --> 40:08.782
they’ll let us know. They’ll call,

40:08.806 --> 40:11.946
or write a letter to the newspaper.

40:11.976 --> 40:15.321
But usually it turns out
it's just some crackpot.

40:17.148 --> 40:18.388
How do you know it is?

40:19.384 --> 40:22.160
They have to prove to us that they did it.

40:22.186 --> 40:24.723
They tell us something about the crime,

40:24.756 --> 40:26.497
something only they would know.

40:26.524 --> 40:29.596
Or give us a piece of
evidence, like the murder weapon.

40:29.627 --> 40:32.506
It takes something like that
to make us believe a confession.

40:32.530 --> 40:35.704
Take our word for it,
without something like that,

40:37.168 --> 40:40.581
there's nothing that's going to
change our mind about your mother.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.344
I just can't believe this.

40:46.611 --> 40:51.026
We don't want to give you
false hope, Mrs. Pomeranski.

40:51.049 --> 40:53.495
You have to prepare yourself for the truth

40:53.518 --> 40:56.761
that your mother killed those
7 people. You understand me?

41:00.258 --> 41:02.704
We're very...

41:02.727 --> 41:06.334
sorry about your situation.

41:08.032 --> 41:11.502
The officer will show you out.

41:58.082 --> 41:59.652
Car 3, you stay with her.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.925
We'll stay with the mailbox.

42:14.732 --> 42:17.212
( knocks )

42:23.808 --> 42:26.186
Yes?

42:26.210 --> 42:29.282
- Very nice.
- Oh, thank you.

42:30.481 --> 42:33.758
- It's too bad.
- What's too bad?

42:35.253 --> 42:37.494
You dropped this in the mailbox.

42:37.522 --> 42:40.059
- No, I--
- We have it all on videotape.

42:40.091 --> 42:42.935
It smells like almonds.

42:42.960 --> 42:46.999
- I'll bet you know what else smells like almonds.
- Trudy Pomeranski, you're under arrest.

42:47.031 --> 42:48.510
- No.
- Please turn around--

42:48.533 --> 42:50.740
No! No!

42:50.768 --> 42:52.441
( sobbing )
No!

42:52.470 --> 42:55.041
- I don't want to hurt you.
- No, no, no, no!

42:55.073 --> 42:58.145
I don't want to go, please, please, please!

42:58.176 --> 43:00.816
No! No!

43:00.845 --> 43:03.325
Please don't make me go!

43:04.682 --> 43:06.628
Come with us, ma'am.

43:06.651 --> 43:08.460
You have the right to remain silent.

43:08.486 --> 43:12.127
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

43:12.156 --> 43:14.534
You're adorable.

43:15.893 --> 43:18.032
That's what dreams are made of.

43:18.062 --> 43:20.440
Bad dreams.
