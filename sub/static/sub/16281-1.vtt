[Woman screaming]

01:24.286 --> 01:26.246
[Indistinct voices]

01:26.287 --> 01:28.456
[Woman shouting]

02:09.452 --> 02:11.704
How about I drive, huh?

02:11.787 --> 02:13.456
[Indistinct talking
on police radio]

02:13.664 --> 02:14.915
Oh.

02:16.917 --> 02:19.169
[Exhales deeply]
There we go.

02:19.211 --> 02:20.754
[Exhales deeply]

02:21.713 --> 02:23.298
About time you showed up.

02:23.381 --> 02:25.300
Some couples like to talk.

02:25.342 --> 02:27.343
Did they see anything?

02:27.469 --> 02:30.555
They don't know the girls,
didn't see the car. Nothing.

02:35.893 --> 02:38.103
How many more miles
do we have left to cover?

02:38.145 --> 02:41.315
SARA: We're on Stone Hollow, and
we need to check these two roads

02:41.356 --> 02:42.649
and circle back around.

02:42.691 --> 02:45.735
Harris wants us back to base
by midnight, so...

02:48.863 --> 02:51.491
Maybe the perimeter's
not wide enough. Maybe...

02:51.616 --> 02:53.492
This guy's a traveler.

02:53.617 --> 02:56.704
Maybe the first body
is throwing us off.

03:32.195 --> 03:34.030
Your turn.

03:41.161 --> 03:43.288
[Mumbling]

03:51.838 --> 03:53.839
[Swing creaking]

04:00.304 --> 04:02.264
[Brahms' "Lullaby" plays]

04:18.195 --> 04:19.988
[Clanging]

04:35.961 --> 04:37.880
New paint, new plates.
It's our guy.

04:37.963 --> 04:40.757
- He's here.
- Shit. Back in the car.

04:40.841 --> 04:43.301
Let him think we're leaving.
We'll get tactical.

04:43.885 --> 04:46.054
All units, this is Predator 5
requesting backup.

04:46.096 --> 04:47.639
We're on Stone Hollow Road.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.600
- We have the UNSUB's vehicle...
- [Women screaming]

04:51.434 --> 04:53.394
They're still alive.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.437
Come on.

04:56.105 --> 04:57.064
FBI!

05:12.536 --> 05:15.831
[Flies buzzing]

05:24.005 --> 05:26.007

[Screaming, gunshots]

06:19.598 --> 06:22.017
- Oh, God.
- Check the girls.

06:25.562 --> 06:26.813
Sara!

06:46.456 --> 06:48.249
Talk to me, Sara.

06:57.758 --> 06:59.885
Predator 5 to base.
Over.

07:00.010 --> 07:04.180
We have the situation secure.
Repeat... situation is secure.

07:04.306 --> 07:06.182
Suspect is dead.

07:06.182 --> 07:07.809
So are the girls.

07:09.769 --> 07:11.771
There were three shots fired.

07:14.065 --> 07:15.483
[Gasps]

07:15.566 --> 07:17.526
Hey!
Sara!

07:17.526 --> 07:19.111
Sara, drop!
Get rid of the line!

07:19.153 --> 07:20.445
Get down! Down!

07:21.405 --> 07:22.447
Drop! Drop!

07:37.711 --> 07:39.213
[Beeping]

07:57.438 --> 07:59.273
Ohh.

08:05.654 --> 08:07.489
[Broken dishes clinking]

08:07.655 --> 08:11.117
Man. Thought you guys
were never gonna get here.

08:12.868 --> 08:15.412
Hey, Harris,
I'm fucking starving!

08:16.830 --> 08:19.333
[Flies buzzing]

08:24.170 --> 08:26.214
[Buzzing stops]

08:35.097 --> 08:37.099
[Engine turns over]

08:39.308 --> 08:41.269
So, tomorrow...

08:41.311 --> 08:43.938
I have a senior staff meeting
with the director,

08:44.063 --> 08:48.234
A Q4 performance review,
and an academy course to prep.

08:48.359 --> 08:52.238
But now, instead, I get to waste
my whole day at your funerals.

08:53.656 --> 08:57.451
Special Agent Moore,
when is the situation secure?

08:58.494 --> 09:00.495
- On the drive home.
- On the drive home.

09:00.621 --> 09:03.415
That's right.
On the drive home.

09:03.456 --> 09:05.166
- Sir, we didn't...
- Shut up.

09:06.334 --> 09:08.336
Cigarettes on the table.
More at the door.

09:08.419 --> 09:09.712
Different brands.

09:09.712 --> 09:12.548
Two cars out front.
4 place settings, not 3.

09:12.632 --> 09:14.508
All should have alerted you
to the possibility

09:14.550 --> 09:17.094
that there might be
another suspect.

09:17.303 --> 09:20.097
- I think...
- I'm sorry? What?

09:21.682 --> 09:23.099
What did you say?

09:23.183 --> 09:27.061
I think you enjoy
watching us fail, sir.

09:27.061 --> 09:29.188
Better in here than out there.

09:29.230 --> 09:30.690
You know this really happened?

09:30.690 --> 09:32.858
The UNSUB was apprehended
in under 2 minutes

09:32.858 --> 09:34.610
without a shot fired.

09:34.693 --> 09:37.613
It took you guys 7 minutes,
and you killed your partner.

09:37.613 --> 09:39.198
Have some cake.

09:42.284 --> 09:43.994
The majority of murders
are committed

09:43.994 --> 09:45.745
by someone known to the victim.

09:45.745 --> 09:49.415
Those that are not solved within
the first 48 hours seldom are.

09:49.499 --> 09:50.958
Not so with serial killers.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.460
One advantage
in this line of work

09:52.543 --> 09:55.504
is knowing that as long as
the UNSUB is out there,

09:55.546 --> 09:57.256
you'll always have
another chance.

09:57.298 --> 09:59.716
With each new killing comes
a resetting of the clock.

09:59.716 --> 10:01.385
Time is on your side.

10:01.510 --> 10:02.719
The model for this exercise

10:02.761 --> 10:06.097
was a missing-persons search
in Buffalo, 1982.

10:06.264 --> 10:09.434
The dead man was an accomplice
who was killed the day before.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.310
The killer staged a suicide

10:11.394 --> 10:14.063
in order to try, in effect,
an escape.

10:14.105 --> 10:18.650
As you can see, some of you
responded better than others.

10:18.650 --> 10:20.819
Well, exactly how many times
has a profiler

10:20.902 --> 10:23.947
been in a kill-or-capture
situation since 1982?

10:23.989 --> 10:25.949
Are you suggesting I'm
preparing you for something

10:25.949 --> 10:27.992
you may never experience?

10:28.117 --> 10:29.952
Success comes
when you understand

10:29.952 --> 10:32.330
that your most lethal weapon
isn't your firearm,

10:32.330 --> 10:34.540
but your brain.

10:34.665 --> 10:36.709
A lot of the old guard
don't believe in my methods.

10:36.917 --> 10:38.502
A lot of them think I'm crazy.

10:39.586 --> 10:41.088
You're a privileged group.

10:41.296 --> 10:43.340
You're all smart
or you wouldn't be here.

10:43.465 --> 10:45.884
I just want you to be smarter.

10:45.884 --> 10:49.637
Our final exercise will be
on the island of Oneiga.

10:50.430 --> 10:54.683
This simulation will be a test
primarily of your teamwork.

10:54.683 --> 10:56.685
I hope you're ready.

10:56.810 --> 10:59.897
Then how could we have saved
the girls at the old hotel?

10:59.980 --> 11:03.400
You couldn't. They were dead
no matter what you did.

11:03.483 --> 11:06.069
What's the point
if we couldn't have saved them?

11:06.152 --> 11:09.405
The point is to get used to it.

11:11.115 --> 11:13.743
? There, you've seen it,
my behavior's unacceptable ?

11:13.909 --> 11:16.203
Good evening, my fine,
young FBI friends.

11:16.287 --> 11:20.499
I am a pretty little thing
just out of lit class at GMU.

11:20.707 --> 11:24.294
Please note the Jimmy Joyce
in my Kate Spade.

11:24.336 --> 11:27.755
My parents are loaded
as per my expensive ensemble.

11:27.797 --> 11:30.591
And that "J"...Where is it?
On my key ring...

11:30.633 --> 11:34.220
means I'm either a Jill
or a Jennifer.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.347
Those being the favorite "J"
names of Beltway parents

11:36.388 --> 11:39.016
circa 1981.

11:39.057 --> 11:41.560
I like to hang with my friends
and have a good time,

11:41.601 --> 11:45.939
but I'm really just a mature
woman looking for a mature man.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.566
And I recently quit smoking.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.152
[English accent]
Why do you say that?

11:51.152 --> 11:53.571
You see the way she keeps eyeing
the guy next to her?

11:53.612 --> 11:55.698
It's not him.
It's his cigarette.

11:55.698 --> 11:57.366
Spoken like a woman who knows.

11:57.491 --> 11:59.118
How long has it been, Nicole?
3 days?

11:59.201 --> 12:01.119
The lovely Nicole
and her personal demons.

12:01.286 --> 12:04.956
I'm surprised there's enough
room at the table for all of us.

12:06.249 --> 12:07.667
Take me 5 minutes
to get her number.

12:07.667 --> 12:09.585
Take me 2.

12:10.670 --> 12:12.129
- You're on.
- Money's coming out.

12:12.255 --> 12:13.255
$20.

12:13.464 --> 12:15.216
- $20 works.
- Whoo!

12:15.257 --> 12:16.592
Whoa, big money.

12:18.469 --> 12:21.346
Hi. I think I know you,
don't I?

12:21.388 --> 12:22.848
You're, um, uh...

12:22.931 --> 12:24.307
Jill, right?

12:24.307 --> 12:25.350
Jen.

12:25.392 --> 12:28.186
Jen, Jen. Yes.
Yes, Jen, of course.

12:28.311 --> 12:30.313
Okay, obviously
you don't remember me.

12:30.354 --> 12:32.690
My name's Bobby.
Bobby Whitman.

12:32.732 --> 12:34.442
Rafe, you're up.
Profile.

12:34.483 --> 12:36.110
Okay.

12:36.110 --> 12:38.987
Black suit, blond hair,
Martini.

12:39.112 --> 12:40.280
I'm the sophisticated type

12:40.280 --> 12:42.449
on the prowl for pretty,
young things.

12:42.491 --> 12:44.743
Preferably blond.

12:44.868 --> 12:48.496
Preferably a cheerleader
with great big...

12:48.496 --> 12:50.873
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Enough.

12:51.791 --> 12:53.709
Right about the blond.
You're on fire.

12:53.793 --> 12:55.461
You're projecting.

12:57.379 --> 13:00.215
I don't know. It was 2 seconds
at a lecture last semester.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.383
GMU Lit Department, right?

13:01.466 --> 13:03.552
The Moody lecture?

13:03.593 --> 13:05.136
Yeah, yeah, Moody.
Heck of a writer.

13:05.220 --> 13:06.346
Um...

13:06.388 --> 13:08.556
I'm actually not even
a student myself.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.099
Um...

13:10.099 --> 13:12.810
I work in finance.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.937
Oh. Finance?

13:15.104 --> 13:18.107
- Oh! Right. Bobby.
- Yeah.

13:18.107 --> 13:20.317
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.

13:20.317 --> 13:22.903
He's got 15 seconds.

13:25.739 --> 13:26.531
Thank you.

13:26.656 --> 13:29.117
Lucas, looks like tonight
wasrt your night.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.661
I know her. Her name's Jen.
I told her to play along.

13:31.661 --> 13:32.870
You're full of shit.

13:33.037 --> 13:34.288
You never know.

13:34.413 --> 13:35.789
ALL: Ooh.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.499
Ooh.

13:37.583 --> 13:38.709
[Laughter]

13:40.794 --> 13:44.547
So, what is going on
in that head?

13:44.589 --> 13:45.757
We're professionals.

13:45.799 --> 13:47.800
We shouldn't have to put up
with Harris' shit.

13:47.884 --> 13:50.303
All right, what's up?

13:52.305 --> 13:54.682
I'm not making profiler.

13:54.765 --> 13:56.100
I was alone in his office.

13:56.183 --> 13:59.937
His recommends were on the desk,
and I read them.

14:00.062 --> 14:02.064
We still have the weekend
at Oneiga.

14:02.105 --> 14:03.482
He says I'm unfocused.

14:03.648 --> 14:04.649
He says I'm not capable

14:04.733 --> 14:08.486
of the psychological commitment
necessary for profiling work.

14:08.611 --> 14:10.196
How do you like that?

14:10.238 --> 14:13.407
Commitment. Like,
"Fucking look at me, man."

14:13.449 --> 14:15.409
Vince, I think...

14:15.451 --> 14:18.245
You're not making profiler
either, Sara.

14:20.497 --> 14:22.749
Sorry.
I read it.

14:24.334 --> 14:26.544
Don't work too hard
out there, okay?

14:36.971 --> 14:38.889
We've got a late addition.

14:38.931 --> 14:41.308
This is Detective Gabe Jenson.

14:41.308 --> 14:43.185
He's from the Philadelphia P.D.

14:43.310 --> 14:44.686
Good morning.
How you doir?

14:44.853 --> 14:46.396
He's their resident profiler,

14:46.438 --> 14:48.147
and somehow he got
on D.O.J.'s good side

14:48.231 --> 14:50.566
and convinced the attorney
general he could sit in

14:50.650 --> 14:53.235
on some exercises
and see how I work.

14:53.235 --> 14:55.362
Do I have the politics
about right?

14:55.404 --> 14:56.614
Something like that.

14:56.697 --> 14:57.906
He's joining the team?

14:57.906 --> 15:00.701
He's just here to observe,
not to participate.

15:00.784 --> 15:02.702
Now, be nice to him
or it's my ass.

15:02.786 --> 15:03.995
No offense, Detective.

15:03.995 --> 15:06.581
None taken. It's an honor
to meet all of you.

15:22.512 --> 15:24.889
You want to do hostage rescue,
a smallpox outbreak,

15:25.056 --> 15:26.349
this is the place.

15:29.435 --> 15:31.437
Navy Seas built it
for war-game practice.

15:31.562 --> 15:34.482
Once a year, they turn it over
to me for the weekend.

15:37.359 --> 15:40.737
Okay, get your rappelling lines
and prepare to drop.

15:41.863 --> 15:43.949
That's a joke.

15:57.044 --> 15:59.713
Here we are.
Crimetown, USA.

15:59.755 --> 16:01.840
Where all the residents
are dead.

16:01.882 --> 16:03.717
Or about to be.

16:03.717 --> 16:07.095
Now, the idea here, people,
is to only kill the bad guys.

16:07.095 --> 16:08.805
[Beeping]

16:08.846 --> 16:09.847
But nobody's perfect.

16:09.889 --> 16:12.683
It's nice
to hear you say that, sir.

16:12.808 --> 16:14.852
RAFE: It's like Beirut
meets Belfast.

16:14.935 --> 16:18.063
Sir, I thought they didn't let
foreign nationals in the FBI.

16:18.188 --> 16:20.691
Don't worry. On the inside
he's 100% American, right?

16:20.816 --> 16:23.235
As American
as the death penalty.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.361
HARRIS:
That's my boy.

16:24.444 --> 16:26.446
I think I'm in love.

16:28.364 --> 16:31.784
Oh, there is one other person.
They'll be coming along shortly.

16:31.909 --> 16:32.952
Who's that?

16:32.994 --> 16:35.287
He's called a puppeteer.

16:35.496 --> 16:37.539
He's killed two people
on these streets,

16:37.664 --> 16:39.416
and he's about to kill a third.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.084
Tomorrow you'll find
the crime scene

16:41.251 --> 16:42.711
and receive
your background dossiers.

16:42.836 --> 16:47.006
By 0800 on Monday, I want
a full profile of this suspect.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.050
I want to know who he is,
what he does,

16:49.050 --> 16:51.010
and where he's gonna do it next.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.846
I'm asking Special Agent Reston
to be team leader

16:53.846 --> 16:55.556
unless you'd like to defer.

16:55.598 --> 16:56.390
No, Harris.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.601
I will solve whatever sick,
twisted crime scenario

16:59.601 --> 17:00.727
you come up with.

17:00.852 --> 17:01.937
I hope so.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.690
What's the tank for?

17:05.690 --> 17:08.483
The Navy uses it
to simulate Arctic regions.

17:08.568 --> 17:11.154
That's what the nitrogers for.

17:11.194 --> 17:14.656
In general, if it says
"military," don't touch it.

17:15.491 --> 17:17.701
Oh.
Great.

17:18.285 --> 17:20.494
Navy humor.

17:24.708 --> 17:27.085
The computers are loaded
with ViCAP,

17:27.085 --> 17:28.461
but they're fully firewalled.

17:28.544 --> 17:31.339
Don't do any research offsite.

17:31.464 --> 17:35.384
If you want to do any
blood samples on the autorad,

17:35.509 --> 17:38.470
analyze fibers...
scout samples...

17:38.470 --> 17:40.931
- [Buzzing]
- It's all here.

17:43.183 --> 17:45.101
You'll rest up here
till the morning.

17:45.143 --> 17:47.520
Downstairs, there's
a fully stocked freezer,

17:47.562 --> 17:49.355
bunks, and your showers.

17:49.397 --> 17:51.482
Don't forget.
You're 50 miles offshore.

17:51.482 --> 17:55.152
If you run out of toilet paper,
you are shit out of luck.

17:55.236 --> 17:56.695
So, what's the point?

17:56.737 --> 17:57.780
Sorry, Detective?

17:57.905 --> 18:00.115
The island, the middle of
nowhere, they're professionals.

18:00.115 --> 18:01.158
What's the point?

18:01.241 --> 18:06.037
The point is that they're
isolated, alone, and forgotten.

18:06.121 --> 18:09.791
That's what it's like to be
inside the mind of a sociopath.

18:10.917 --> 18:13.836
Have you noticed it's
a really bad feeling here?

18:19.591 --> 18:21.301
Good luck on your profile.

18:45.865 --> 18:46.866
Go!

18:47.033 --> 18:50.286
# It's gettir hot #

18:50.411 --> 18:52.246
# It's gettir hot #

18:54.206 --> 18:56.417
# It's gettir hot #

18:57.751 --> 18:59.211
# It's gettir hot #

19:00.587 --> 19:01.588
[Dings]

19:01.630 --> 19:03.757
# It's gettir hot #

19:04.966 --> 19:06.342
# It's gettir hot #

19:06.468 --> 19:08.136
# Come on, baby,
come on, baby #

19:08.219 --> 19:09.887
What?

19:12.056 --> 19:14.350
He said dress for an island.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.604
J. D:
So, Detective,

19:18.687 --> 19:22.107
what exactly did you do to earn
this island paradise?

19:22.190 --> 19:24.192
Recommended for it.
Same as you.

19:24.234 --> 19:25.235
Why, though?

19:25.318 --> 19:27.570
Did you catch some killer
in Philly or something?

19:27.654 --> 19:28.905
What's the deal?

19:29.030 --> 19:31.449
You don't want to know
my war stories.

19:31.532 --> 19:33.409
Well, actually, I do.

19:33.409 --> 19:35.202
I mean, right now,

19:35.286 --> 19:37.705
what do we know
about you for real?

19:37.788 --> 19:39.957
We know he's got resentments
toward his parents,

19:39.998 --> 19:43.293
as per the overload on tattoos
he's got there.

19:43.418 --> 19:45.587
We know he's just out
of a bad relationship.

19:45.712 --> 19:47.755
He's barely looked twice
at me and Sara.

19:47.839 --> 19:50.341
Maybe you're not my type,
Nicole.

19:50.508 --> 19:52.093
We're alone on an island.

19:52.134 --> 19:54.512
Trust me, I'm your type.

19:56.096 --> 19:58.515
We also know
he watches his words.

19:58.515 --> 20:02.102
So that crossword's either
a sign of honing a talent

20:02.102 --> 20:03.520
or correcting a deficiency.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.480
What you say about me
doesn't tell you about me.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.857
It tells me about you.

20:07.899 --> 20:10.693
Now, I could say
your little gambling

20:10.818 --> 20:13.070
means you have
an addictive personality.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.196
I could say I know

20:14.196 --> 20:16.865
you're sleeping with one
of the guys in this room.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.117
I could say you take charge
of your team

20:19.201 --> 20:21.995
because you never had a leader
in your own life.

20:22.037 --> 20:23.330
And you.

20:23.330 --> 20:26.332
When push comes to shove,
you crack under pressure.

20:26.541 --> 20:28.960
Your partners can't depend
on you.

20:29.085 --> 20:31.254
You don't belong here.

20:31.337 --> 20:33.089
But that's all surface.

20:33.130 --> 20:35.257
Psych 101 bullshit.

20:35.299 --> 20:37.509
That's not who you are.

20:41.513 --> 20:43.932
All for killing him
in his sleep?

20:48.353 --> 20:49.687
# It's gettir hot #

20:49.812 --> 20:52.231
Bad for you... 1:45.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.191
Damn!

21:03.200 --> 21:05.702
[Waves crashing]

21:05.744 --> 21:08.913
You push me in,
I'll have your badge.

21:08.955 --> 21:13.501
I, uh, came out here
to feed the ducks.

21:13.709 --> 21:15.753
I see you're feeding the ducks.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.088
Maybe we could feed the ducks
together.

21:19.047 --> 21:20.507
Leave you alone?

21:20.507 --> 21:22.092
No, no.
It's all right.

21:28.848 --> 21:30.850
I don't smoke.

21:30.850 --> 21:32.852
I know.
It's a gesture.

21:33.060 --> 21:35.813
Goodwill, sympathy.
You know, the usual.

21:35.896 --> 21:38.857
In lieu of knowing
what's going on.

21:38.982 --> 21:41.902
He's not gonna let me
make profiler.

21:43.361 --> 21:45.905
He thinks I can't get past it.

21:45.947 --> 21:47.240
Is he right?

21:56.290 --> 22:00.043
When I was a kid,
I lost both my parents.

22:00.085 --> 22:02.087
Freak thing.

22:02.212 --> 22:05.840
10 years old.
Bang. Mortality.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.259
So I grew up living real hard.

22:08.343 --> 22:11.053
Racing cars, smoking, drinking,

22:11.053 --> 22:13.264
sleeping with any girl
I could find.

22:13.305 --> 22:17.017
Real stupid,
dangerous lifestyle.

22:17.059 --> 22:18.894
Then I turned 11, and...

22:24.107 --> 22:26.359
All I know is this.

22:26.401 --> 22:29.320
You don't confront your demons
and defeat them.

22:29.362 --> 22:31.364
You confront them.

22:31.531 --> 22:32.907
Then you confront them.

22:32.907 --> 22:35.743
Then you confront them
some more.

22:35.743 --> 22:37.870
Every single day.

22:41.832 --> 22:43.917
[Water running]

23:07.355 --> 23:09.148
[Crackling]

23:10.149 --> 23:11.567
[Both grunting]

23:15.696 --> 23:18.490
You are seriously fucked up,
you know that?

23:18.615 --> 23:20.909
You know what I hate
about you, J.D.?

23:20.909 --> 23:22.119
What?

23:22.202 --> 23:24.496
You only want me for my mind.

23:38.801 --> 23:41.386
[Breathing heavily]

25:01.168 --> 25:02.419
NICOLE:
What happened?

25:11.135 --> 25:13.846
I'd like to know
how Harris got it here.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.515
I'd say the issue is "why?"

25:20.018 --> 25:21.853
Here, kitty kitty.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.066
What kind of simulation is this?

25:31.487 --> 25:33.989
Ah. Oh!

25:34.031 --> 25:35.658
Ugh.

25:35.783 --> 25:37.117
10:00.

25:38.994 --> 25:41.246
That supposed to mean something?

25:41.330 --> 25:44.749
So, what, is this supposed to be
some kind of warning sign?

25:44.833 --> 25:49.087
Well, if I know Harris,
it's a sign of something.

25:52.757 --> 25:55.801
It's 9:30 A.M.,
Saturday morning.

25:55.885 --> 25:58.303
We're in search
of an unknown crime scene.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.014
We'll split into pairs.

26:01.098 --> 26:04.517
The first one who finds it wins
my eternal love and devotion.

26:04.643 --> 26:06.061
And a dead cat.

26:07.312 --> 26:09.063
And a dead cat.

26:11.065 --> 26:12.900
[Bell rings]

26:13.651 --> 26:16.195
Now, this place
must remind you of home.

26:16.237 --> 26:19.198
Ha.
Happytown, USA.

26:19.281 --> 26:20.407
Sst!

26:21.199 --> 26:22.492
Look.

26:25.704 --> 26:27.539
It's little Bobby.

26:28.539 --> 26:31.042
Little Bobby's gonna grow up
to be big and strong

26:31.167 --> 26:33.210
and pursue a career
in buried children

26:33.294 --> 26:35.045
and dismembered mummies.

26:35.087 --> 26:38.507
Now, that will make
Happytown proud.

26:38.507 --> 26:41.051
I think you're
in the wrong line of work.

26:44.471 --> 26:46.056
No, mate.

26:47.515 --> 26:49.100
Not me.

Hey!

26:54.146 --> 26:56.857
Dinner at Harris' house.

together or what?

27:16.333 --> 27:19.086
Suit yourself.
I'm on vacation.

27:21.088 --> 27:22.089
Hey, Vince!

27:22.214 --> 27:24.090
Check out
the other side of town.

27:24.090 --> 27:26.509
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hey, everybody!

son of a bitch.

27:42.190 --> 27:44.734
Stay on my 6.

27:44.818 --> 27:47.987
Okay, everybody, it's about
that time to look alive.

27:48.112 --> 27:51.741
We have victim.

27:51.866 --> 27:53.868
Or victims?

27:54.785 --> 27:58.247
We got a single victim.

28:00.290 --> 28:03.835
The puppeteer.
That's a hell of a signature.

28:06.171 --> 28:09.215
Why don't you check
the employee logs, receipts?

28:09.257 --> 28:12.468
See who shopped here, who
worked here. That sort of thing.

28:12.468 --> 28:14.845
Let me run forensic,
work the timeline.

28:14.845 --> 28:16.930
Sara, why don't you check
the carcass?

28:18.057 --> 28:19.183
Sara!

28:19.266 --> 28:20.183
Sure.

28:23.353 --> 28:24.562
Oh.

28:26.147 --> 28:27.815
There's splatter
behind the counter.

28:27.899 --> 28:30.193
The girl was definitely moved.

28:30.318 --> 28:32.194
Any venture as to weapon?

28:32.320 --> 28:34.488
- You want to take point on M.O.?
- Absolutely.

28:34.697 --> 28:36.699
Nic, not to step on your toes,

28:36.740 --> 28:40.035
but I'm gonna bet
the guy's a trophy taker.

28:54.006 --> 28:55.466
What are you smiling about?

28:55.549 --> 28:57.968
If the taxpayers only knew...

28:57.968 --> 29:00.512
I think I'll go see if the
UNSUB's still in the building.

29:00.595 --> 29:03.139
Sweetheart, it's just
a simulation, yeah?

29:03.139 --> 29:06.935
Where we're from, a site search
is called procedure.

29:06.935 --> 29:08.519
Yeah?

29:12.106 --> 29:14.483
We should have been allowed
to bring our guns.

29:14.567 --> 29:16.318
It doesn't feel real
without my gun.

29:16.485 --> 29:18.904

how real do you want it?

29:19.488 --> 29:21.281

# Pull my strings,
it's time to play #

Harris has in mind.

# Surprises
at puppet playtime #

it's a challenge, right?

# Hope you all enjoy
your stay #

Aah!

No!
Don't touch it!

- They're frozen!
- Help him!

Aah!

30:52.948 --> 30:54.867
This is a joke, right?

30:54.867 --> 30:57.494
That was just a simulation.

31:01.498 --> 31:04.042
[Crying]

31:41.284 --> 31:43.161
I'm sorry, Nic.

31:50.084 --> 31:52.920
- Were they working before?
- No signal, nothing.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.964
What if it was
some kind of accident?

31:55.089 --> 31:57.299
Someone killed J.D.
Don't you get it?

31:58.717 --> 32:00.719
Someone is here on this island.

32:02.095 --> 32:04.264
That wasrt there
last night either.

32:10.436 --> 32:12.146
12:00.

32:12.229 --> 32:13.606
It's an hour and a half.

32:13.647 --> 32:15.608
It's a message.

32:17.651 --> 32:19.820
What about the boat?

32:19.903 --> 32:23.365
We saw that pier with the boat
when we flew in.

32:23.406 --> 32:25.408
Watch your backs
and everyone else's.

32:25.492 --> 32:26.951
Hit the boat and find the radio.

32:26.993 --> 32:29.495
The simulatiors over.

32:41.256 --> 32:43.967
Now is not the time for fear,
people.

32:44.843 --> 32:47.011
- Now is the ti...
- [Beeping]

32:48.054 --> 32:49.305
Shit.

33:05.945 --> 33:07.280
- Sara!
- Ohh!

33:09.365 --> 33:10.533
Sara!

33:10.741 --> 33:12.493
Get her out of the water!

33:31.260 --> 33:32.803
[Both gasping]

33:32.845 --> 33:35.347
Help me get her
out of the water!

33:37.182 --> 33:39.351
Get her out of the water!

33:39.351 --> 33:41.186
Ugh!

33:41.269 --> 33:43.355
It's okay.
You're okay.

33:43.396 --> 33:44.939
Aah!

33:44.981 --> 33:46.691
I'll handle it.
I'll handle it.

33:46.733 --> 33:47.817
I've got her.

33:47.901 --> 33:50.319
Back the fuck off!
I'll handle it!

33:55.908 --> 33:57.409
It's okay.

33:57.493 --> 34:00.120
You're out of the water,
all right? You're out.

34:00.203 --> 34:01.496
Aah!

34:02.289 --> 34:05.000
All right.
You're out of the water.

34:06.251 --> 34:08.835
- You're okay.
- What's her thing with water?

34:11.297 --> 34:13.049
I think I lost my smokes.

34:14.592 --> 34:17.469
Harris brought us
to this island.

34:17.553 --> 34:20.514
Now we're not allowed to leave.

34:20.597 --> 34:23.183
- Let's talk about this Harris.
- [Coughing]

34:23.308 --> 34:25.185
Harris wouldn't do this.

34:25.185 --> 34:27.603
You can say what you want,
but Harris is a company man.

34:27.687 --> 34:31.065
Did anyone actually see him
get back in that chopper?

34:31.148 --> 34:32.900
Oh, tell me
somebody witnessed that.

34:32.900 --> 34:35.360
Maybe he got tired
of the simulations.

34:35.444 --> 34:37.905
Missed the taste
of the real thing.

34:39.864 --> 34:42.117
I'll give him a taste
of the real thing.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.452
Did he just pull
that gun out of his arse?

34:45.745 --> 34:48.039
We werert supposed to
bring weapons.

34:48.164 --> 34:49.916
My gun goes where I go.

34:49.998 --> 34:52.793
If you get shot sometime,
maybe you'll understand.

34:52.835 --> 34:55.420
You shouldn't have brought
your weapon, Vince.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.215
You're gonna be glad I did.

35:08.558 --> 35:10.143
Two square miles at most.

35:10.184 --> 35:13.020
Hey.
Check this out.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.732
Who wants to play
some hide-and-seek?

35:18.317 --> 35:19.902
Anyone else is on this island,

35:19.943 --> 35:22.988
Harris or worse,
we're gonna find them.

35:23.029 --> 35:26.032
How's about your Navy?

35:26.116 --> 35:28.242
They don't muck around, do they?

35:38.502 --> 35:40.420
GABE:
Damn cats.

35:46.801 --> 35:48.970
[Thunder crashes]

36:05.443 --> 36:07.904
Aah! Aah!

36:07.987 --> 36:10.948
Oh, for the love of God,
just take the arm.

36:13.200 --> 36:16.996
There. There.
That's the Lucas I know.

36:17.121 --> 36:20.165
You want to get up
and do it all over again.

36:20.165 --> 36:22.209
Are you all right?

36:22.292 --> 36:23.543
Yeah.
I told you I'm fine.

36:23.668 --> 36:25.086
Yeah, you told me, but...

36:25.170 --> 36:27.130
As long as people aren't
asking me if I'm all right,

36:27.130 --> 36:28.965
I'm all right.

36:30.466 --> 36:32.593
So can I ask you
something else, then?

36:32.718 --> 36:35.512
Anything else.

36:35.512 --> 36:37.931
Well, since the end
may be near here,

36:38.056 --> 36:41.268
have you kind of always
sort of had a thing for me?

36:45.313 --> 36:47.148
Aah!

36:47.232 --> 36:49.442
[Laughs]

36:49.567 --> 36:51.235
Is that a no?

36:53.946 --> 36:56.115
20 minutes of 12:00.

37:06.166 --> 37:08.626
So at 12:00
someone else is killed?

37:09.711 --> 37:11.295
Somebody left those watches.

37:11.337 --> 37:13.089
And left them
after Harris had gone.

37:13.089 --> 37:15.591
Where is this killer?
We searched the island.

37:15.716 --> 37:17.760
Somebody set that trap.

37:17.843 --> 37:19.219
Somebody rigged that boat.

37:19.303 --> 37:21.680
So what are we saying?

37:21.680 --> 37:23.431
This is some kind of game?

37:23.515 --> 37:26.810
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.

37:26.851 --> 37:29.062
Who's the next motherfucker
to go?

37:31.230 --> 37:33.190
It's 12:00.

37:33.232 --> 37:34.984
It's 12:00,
and we're still here!

37:35.109 --> 37:37.194
We're still here,
and it's 12:00, and...

37:37.236 --> 37:39.196
Shut up, Vince.

37:39.363 --> 37:40.781
All right. Look.

37:40.947 --> 37:43.158
We know that there
is a killer on the island.

37:43.241 --> 37:45.368
Someone who knows
what we're here for,

37:45.368 --> 37:46.953
someone who knows where we'd be.

37:46.995 --> 37:48.955
There's just one problem.

37:48.955 --> 37:52.291
There's no one
on the island but us.

37:57.171 --> 37:58.881
Now, hold on.

37:59.631 --> 38:01.383
Real slow.

38:01.508 --> 38:03.468
Real easy like.

38:03.468 --> 38:07.138
Let's all move our hands
away from our weapons.

38:07.639 --> 38:09.432
- You get on the ground.
- Lucas.

38:09.640 --> 38:13.019
I'm checking the rooms.
I find this... by his bed.

38:13.060 --> 38:16.230
It's maps of the island,
the building, everything here.

38:16.355 --> 38:17.981
Been doing some research
on the place?

38:18.107 --> 38:20.901
- I can goddamn explain.
- You can get on the ground!

38:20.984 --> 38:24.362
This is a military facility!
No one has access to this stuff!

38:24.362 --> 38:26.156
- [Guns cocking]
- Whoa.

38:29.951 --> 38:33.371
You got me all wrong.

38:33.496 --> 38:35.497
Oh, yeah, Detective?
They your maps?

38:35.581 --> 38:38.917
I want to see
your hands up. Up!

38:39.710 --> 38:41.044
You believe me.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.464
- No one leaves this room.
- Since when is this room safe?

38:44.464 --> 38:45.882
Since we're all in it.

38:45.882 --> 38:47.842
On your knees now.

38:47.884 --> 38:50.052
Now! Down!

38:59.519 --> 39:02.856
Sara, can you feel your face?

39:02.939 --> 39:05.734
Because I can't feel
your face...

39:09.946 --> 39:11.906
Coffee.

39:11.948 --> 39:13.532
Huh?

39:13.616 --> 39:15.534
There's something in the coffee.

39:15.659 --> 39:18.120
- Ohh!
- [Cup shatters]

39:18.871 --> 39:19.913
Ohh.

39:19.955 --> 39:21.790
[Cup shatters]

39:21.915 --> 39:23.041
Ohh!

39:24.084 --> 39:25.251
SARA:
Hey, Nic...

39:25.293 --> 39:29.005
Stay... away from...

39:29.047 --> 39:31.632
[Speaking indistinctly]

39:31.716 --> 39:33.217
[Cup shatters]

40:24.431 --> 40:25.515
[Beeps]

40:35.566 --> 40:36.692
[Meows]

40:47.285 --> 40:50.037
- [Grunts]
- You going somewhere?

40:50.830 --> 40:52.206
Come here.

40:52.248 --> 40:54.083
Sit down.

40:54.208 --> 40:56.335
- Hey, man, I can explain.
- Shut up.

40:56.418 --> 40:58.420
- Listen, I can explain.
- I said shut up!

40:58.504 --> 40:59.963
You don't know
what you're doing.

40:59.963 --> 41:01.131
You don't know who I am.

41:01.131 --> 41:03.717
I know you killed J.D.
That's what I know.

41:03.758 --> 41:05.301
Is everybody all right?

41:05.343 --> 41:06.761
Sara.

41:06.761 --> 41:08.012
Sara.

41:10.348 --> 41:12.308
Hey. Hey.
Sara.

41:12.516 --> 41:14.560
Sara? Hey.

41:14.643 --> 41:17.479
[Breathing heavily]

41:19.898 --> 41:23.235
I just had the worst dream ever.

41:23.443 --> 41:24.944
Come on.

41:25.070 --> 41:26.696
Look.

41:26.863 --> 41:29.866
If I'm the killer,
why didn't I run?

41:31.492 --> 41:34.036
You were all lying here.
How come so am I?

41:34.161 --> 41:37.206
Maybe it's a trick so you
can finish what you started!

41:37.247 --> 41:39.333
Look, I'll tell you why
the maps were in the bedroom.

41:39.416 --> 41:41.501
No! You tell us
what you put in the coffee!

41:41.585 --> 41:44.713
- That's what you tell us.
- Hey! Who made it?

41:45.380 --> 41:47.340
Did I make the coffee?

41:48.049 --> 41:49.509
Sherlock Holmes
over there made it.

41:49.550 --> 41:51.344
The man is calling you a killer.

41:51.344 --> 41:54.096
Personally, I think you might
want to defend yourself.

41:55.014 --> 41:56.890
Aah! Aah! Aah!

41:57.099 --> 41:59.893
Oh, fuck!
Ohh!

42:01.019 --> 42:04.064
[Whimpers]
Oh, fuck!

42:05.065 --> 42:06.357
There's...

42:06.441 --> 42:07.817
There's no blood.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.569
Somebody...

42:09.652 --> 42:11.821
drained his blood.

42:34.300 --> 42:35.718
LUCAS:
6:00.

42:35.759 --> 42:37.761
Two watches.

42:37.845 --> 42:41.306
Two watches means two victims?

42:42.099 --> 42:44.309
We got 20 minutes.

42:44.309 --> 42:46.269
All right.

42:46.269 --> 42:47.645
[Grunting]

42:49.355 --> 42:51.232
Right. I want to know what
the next trap is.

42:51.232 --> 42:53.192
And I want to know now.

42:53.234 --> 42:55.653
I can't tell you
because I don't know!

42:55.736 --> 42:57.654
You've been lying to us
since we got here.

42:57.738 --> 42:59.364
That doesn't make me
the killer.

42:59.406 --> 43:01.908
The dead people does.

43:01.992 --> 43:04.286
How about the Ioner mentality?

43:04.369 --> 43:06.204
How about the issues
with the FBI?

43:06.204 --> 43:07.330
I'm not a cop.

43:07.330 --> 43:09.540
I'm an investigator
with the Department of Justice.

43:09.749 --> 43:12.168
I was sent to
investigate Harris.

43:12.168 --> 43:14.712
The attorney general was hearing
rumors about his methods.

43:14.712 --> 43:17.297
There was talk he was
pushing trainees too far.

43:17.297 --> 43:19.716
The FBI investigates the FBI.

43:19.716 --> 43:21.510
Not if you want it done right.

43:21.551 --> 43:23.720
Look, they took him out
of the field for a reason.

43:23.845 --> 43:25.638
Justice was talking
maybe that wasrt enough.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.307
They sent me to see
how he works you.

43:27.390 --> 43:29.684
The maps were prep.
It's a job!

43:29.809 --> 43:31.269
Oh, this is not happening.

43:31.310 --> 43:34.605
You want to hook me up to
a polygraph, hook me up!

43:34.647 --> 43:36.607
Yeah, we know how to beat
a polygraph, too.

43:36.649 --> 43:39.401
He's lying.
Watch his eyes.

43:40.485 --> 43:43.446
I'm not lying.
I just don't like you.

43:45.031 --> 43:46.950
Okay.
You got 15 minutes.

43:46.950 --> 43:48.493
So tell us where the trap is,

43:48.493 --> 43:51.162
or you never leave this room,
and I mean never.

43:51.162 --> 43:52.538
Don't take your eyes off of him.

43:52.705 --> 43:54.290
Okay.

43:54.498 --> 43:55.749
[Door closes]

43:57.709 --> 43:59.753
Now, start talking.

44:03.632 --> 44:05.842
It's a nine-number sequence
repeating itself.

44:05.842 --> 44:07.468
Nine permutations.

44:07.510 --> 44:09.053
What? A code?
A combination?

44:09.095 --> 44:11.264
It has something to do
with time!

44:11.347 --> 44:13.015
He has an obsession with time!

44:13.099 --> 44:14.850
Forget the numbers.
We need to find the trap.

44:15.017 --> 44:16.393
The numbers are the message.

44:16.435 --> 44:18.562
What if it tells us
where the trap might be?

44:18.562 --> 44:20.314
Fine. Bobby,
help her work the numbers.

44:20.397 --> 44:22.065
I'm searching the building.

44:22.149 --> 44:23.817
I'm searching with you.

44:23.900 --> 44:25.110
[Sighs]

44:26.569 --> 44:27.654
10 minutes.

44:46.087 --> 44:48.506
Phone number, Social Security
number, coordinates.

44:48.589 --> 44:50.633
- Talk to me!
- Seven minutes.

44:52.093 --> 44:53.803
Between you and me...

44:55.054 --> 44:57.056
I'm not a violent person.

44:57.139 --> 44:59.558
The thing I've learned
in my life is this.

44:59.558 --> 45:02.394
Sometimes if you find yourself
feeling deep anger

45:02.519 --> 45:03.770
and frustration

45:03.937 --> 45:07.565
about where you find yourself,
what has happened to you...

45:08.358 --> 45:11.360
The healthy thing to do
is to find an outlet

45:11.569 --> 45:13.738
and let it all fucking go.

45:14.488 --> 45:15.990
6:00.

45:16.115 --> 45:19.117
One of us dies,
my outlet is you.

45:21.703 --> 45:22.829
[Beeps]

45:31.462 --> 45:33.798
I am not your guy.

45:38.969 --> 45:40.971
You don't want to do this, man.

45:41.596 --> 45:44.432
You'll have to live
with what you don't know.

45:45.767 --> 45:47.560
I think we're clear
on this level.

45:47.769 --> 45:49.771
The obsession is time.
It has to do with time.

45:49.812 --> 45:51.105
I know it.

45:51.105 --> 45:54.066
5, 8, 2, 9, 9, 7, 9, 2, 4.
What is it?

45:54.108 --> 45:55.109
Sara, it's no use.

45:55.150 --> 45:57.569
8, 2, 9, 9, 7, 9, 2, 4, 5.

45:57.694 --> 45:58.695
- What is that?
- Sara...

45:58.695 --> 46:00.113
2, 9, 9, 7, 9...

46:00.280 --> 46:03.450
It's a number!
It's a fucking number!

46:03.533 --> 46:06.119
They're all just
fucking numbers!

46:17.546 --> 46:21.466
7, 9, 2... 4, 5, 8... 2, 7, 9.

46:21.550 --> 46:24.761
Anybody? Anyone?
What are we thinking here?

46:24.803 --> 46:26.387
What about a rate?

46:26.513 --> 46:28.765
When you factor in time,
an amount becomes a rate.

46:28.806 --> 46:29.766
Or a speed!

46:29.932 --> 46:31.892
Yes. What kind of speed
do you measure in the millions?

46:32.018 --> 46:34.520
Atoms? Electrons?
How the hell should I know?

46:35.354 --> 46:36.689
Light.

46:41.068 --> 46:43.904
299 million...

46:43.904 --> 46:46.448
792,458
meters per second.

46:46.656 --> 46:48.283
This is the original
measurement for light!

46:48.408 --> 46:49.617
And you know that?

56:06.836 --> 56:09.839
Near the Outer Banks
of North Carolina?

56:11.215 --> 56:14.593
settled by the Europeans
in the New World.

56:14.718 --> 56:17.763
In the 16th century,
there was a ship of settlers

who landed right around here,

56:19.640 --> 56:22.767
sent to colonize
the place for England.

on Roanoke Island.

where those people have gone.

She wanted us dead

I swear on my life it's not me.

01:03:26.114 --> 01:03:28.449
Well, we can stay
in here and debate.

01:03:29.867 --> 01:03:32.495
But there's 10 minutes
till the trap.

01:03:36.248 --> 01:03:39.001
What is the trap?
Where is the trap?

01:03:39.001 --> 01:03:40.210

- No, you tell me!

What if she's telling the truth,
Nic? Think about it.

01:03:59.311 --> 01:04:02.063
This is what the killer wants.

01:04:02.063 --> 01:04:05.066
Suspecting each other,
fighting each other.

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:08.069
This is what makes it fun.

01:04:08.236 --> 01:04:10.863
You in the killer's mind again?

01:04:10.863 --> 01:04:12.782

from any of us.

- I'll take blood from you!

I know who to trust.

in our position.

You're a professional.

That's not this killer.
This killer is impersonal.

Deadlines, rules.

of proving superiority.

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:51.706
She's right, Gabe.

01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:53.416
You know what else is right?

They don't let killers
in the FBI.

01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:59.713
Playing hurt, playing wounded.

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:02.507

Let's think here.

01:06:17.062 --> 01:06:19.189
All along we've been assuming
the deaths have been random,

01:06:19.314 --> 01:06:20.982
that anybody
could walk into any trap.

J.D. Dies because
he was out front, leading us.

He was always out front.

01:06:26.905 --> 01:06:29.157

Rafe's a coffee junkie.

to get something to work?

You're saying he knew
who died, when?

through our characteristics,

Stop shooting!
Stop shooting!

01:15:58.303 --> 01:16:01.807
Sara! Sara, stay right
where you are!

01:16:07.645 --> 01:16:09.480
[Crying softly]

01:16:36.046 --> 01:16:38.715
That's the price you pay
for being fearless.

01:17:00.819 --> 01:17:02.362
Sara?

01:17:09.368 --> 01:17:11.287
Sara?

01:18:15.137 --> 01:18:17.931
[Hinges creaking]

01:18:18.015 --> 01:18:19.933
[Grunting]

[Footsteps approaching
rapidly]

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.594
[Footsteps departing]

01:19:12.898 --> 01:19:14.108
[Elevator whirring]

01:19:26.995 --> 01:19:28.037
[Dings]

01:19:46.346 --> 01:19:48.097
Close, God damn it.

01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:56.939
Who wants off this island?!

01:19:59.983 --> 01:20:01.068
You.

01:20:03.194 --> 01:20:04.237
[Dings]

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.864
[Elevator whirring]

01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:18.167
[Dings]

01:20:53.407 --> 01:20:55.534
Never anywhere without a gun.

01:20:57.536 --> 01:20:59.288
Back on schedule.

01:21:03.041 --> 01:21:05.710
Guess we have answers now,
don't we, Sara?

01:21:14.009 --> 01:21:15.511
Who are you?

01:21:15.511 --> 01:21:17.304
Who are you?

01:21:17.346 --> 01:21:18.514
Who are you?

01:21:19.514 --> 01:21:21.516
You gonna panic now, Sara?

01:21:22.642 --> 01:21:25.437
You gonna panic
when you've been so cool?

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.230
[Gun cocks]

01:21:27.230 --> 01:21:28.439
Oh.

01:21:29.607 --> 01:21:31.400
What are you trying to prove?

01:21:31.484 --> 01:21:33.402
What am I trying to prove?

01:21:34.069 --> 01:21:36.947
How's a fucked-up girl like you
get into the FBI...

01:21:36.947 --> 01:21:38.865
anyway?

01:21:40.534 --> 01:21:42.285
How did I get in?

01:21:43.245 --> 01:21:45.914
How did I get in?
Did you not get in, Gabe?

01:21:45.955 --> 01:21:48.333
Did you try,
and they turned you away?

01:21:48.541 --> 01:21:49.709
What did they tell you?

01:21:49.709 --> 01:21:52.086
You're not sharp enough,
smart enough,

01:21:52.086 --> 01:21:53.879
sane enough?

01:21:55.256 --> 01:21:56.715
Panic.

01:22:00.594 --> 01:22:01.845
Watch her panic.

01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:05.557
Get your hands up.
I want to see your hands!

01:22:06.516 --> 01:22:07.433
Boo.

01:22:07.433 --> 01:22:10.520
You call yourself a profiler?

01:22:10.603 --> 01:22:13.314
Show me your hands.

01:22:13.397 --> 01:22:14.899
I'm the profiler.

01:22:14.982 --> 01:22:17.609
I want to see your hands.

01:22:21.196 --> 01:22:22.489
You're the victim.

01:22:31.038 --> 01:22:32.081
Un!

01:23:02.943 --> 01:23:04.569
[Gun clicking]

01:23:10.199 --> 01:23:11.158
Aah!

01:23:11.534 --> 01:23:12.910
Aah!

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:23.295
Aaah!

01:23:39.935 --> 01:23:40.769
Aah!

01:24:03.081 --> 01:24:05.333
[Grunts]

01:24:32.733 --> 01:24:34.443
Watch your head.

01:24:45.453 --> 01:24:47.455
Oh, thank God.

01:24:48.831 --> 01:24:50.583
I thought...

01:24:52.251 --> 01:24:53.961
Bulletproof vest.

01:24:57.589 --> 01:25:02.010
I just need
a little "R" and "R," huh?

01:25:02.093 --> 01:25:04.346
Surf and sand.

01:25:06.556 --> 01:25:08.808
Just stay still.

01:25:10.393 --> 01:25:12.561
- Just stay still.
- Uh-huh.

01:25:15.064 --> 01:25:16.648
Hey, you, uh...

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:20.318
You think they're
ever gonna believe us?

01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:24.406
They won't have to.

01:25:24.447 --> 01:25:26.449
We can prove it.

01:25:28.159 --> 01:25:30.286
After Bobby died...

01:25:30.411 --> 01:25:33.080
I changed the clock back
15 minutes.

01:25:35.249 --> 01:25:36.709
What are you talking about?

01:25:36.792 --> 01:25:38.794
What did Harris always tell us?

01:25:38.835 --> 01:25:42.297
Know the mind, then anticipate.

01:25:42.339 --> 01:25:46.593
The killer was into deadlines,
precision, timing,

01:25:46.718 --> 01:25:49.512
so I set that clock
15 minutes back.

01:25:49.554 --> 01:25:50.888
The clock?

01:25:51.013 --> 01:25:52.098
Oh, yeah.

01:25:52.098 --> 01:25:54.892
He wanted us to know exactly
when he was going to strike,

01:25:55.017 --> 01:25:56.185
wanted to watch us squirm

01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:59.229
as precious seconds
were ticking away.

01:25:59.313 --> 01:26:01.064
It was all part of his fun.

01:26:02.107 --> 01:26:03.566
His weakness.

01:26:04.901 --> 01:26:07.070
I was betting
he'd change it back.

01:26:07.153 --> 01:26:08.654
I was right.

01:26:09.447 --> 01:26:12.783
But how are you gonna prove it
was Gabe who changed it back?

01:26:13.951 --> 01:26:16.787
Remember the phosphorescent
powder from the jackets?

01:26:16.912 --> 01:26:18.789
That's what I put on the clock.

01:26:26.421 --> 01:26:28.131
It was my turn to set a trap.

01:26:28.256 --> 01:26:29.966
So when he touched it...

01:26:30.007 --> 01:26:33.302
Mm-hmm.
His hands are going to glow.

01:26:33.344 --> 01:26:34.553
Watch.

01:26:56.281 --> 01:26:58.450
[Gasps]

01:27:05.081 --> 01:27:06.708
This is awkward.

01:27:10.044 --> 01:27:11.712
You know, uh...

01:27:13.547 --> 01:27:16.884
All these things, they worked
pretty good, you know.

01:27:17.009 --> 01:27:19.720
Timers, triggers.

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:21.388
Remotes.

01:27:23.306 --> 01:27:24.432
But at the end of the day,

01:27:24.516 --> 01:27:28.644
building a better mousetrap
is just pure mechanics.

01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:32.189
It's knowing how to bait
a particular mouse.

01:27:32.231 --> 01:27:34.233
That's the fun part.

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.609
[Gasps]

01:27:35.693 --> 01:27:37.194
Ah, ah, ah-ah.

01:27:46.744 --> 01:27:48.746
So there I was.

01:27:48.913 --> 01:27:51.832
Sitting next to the bodies
of my parents.

01:27:51.916 --> 01:27:52.958
Just waiting for someone

01:27:53.084 --> 01:27:55.461
to ask me
why I killed them, you know?

01:27:55.502 --> 01:27:57.296
And this detective
comes up to me, right?

01:27:57.463 --> 01:27:59.089
And he says...

01:28:00.465 --> 01:28:01.883
"Want some gum?"

01:28:03.093 --> 01:28:04.302
Gum.

01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:07.055
No one asks.

01:28:07.096 --> 01:28:09.599
It never even occurs to them.

01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:13.102
And like after
every first high...

01:28:13.185 --> 01:28:16.688
it's harder and harder
to get to that place.

01:28:16.814 --> 01:28:20.317
And finally you get so good,
there's no feeling at all.

01:28:20.359 --> 01:28:21.818
It's easy.

01:28:23.153 --> 01:28:25.655
Finding a won'thy prey.

01:28:25.738 --> 01:28:27.907
A challenge.

01:28:27.949 --> 01:28:29.492
That's hard.

01:28:30.701 --> 01:28:33.704
You joined the FBI for this?

01:28:33.704 --> 01:28:35.080
Yeah.

01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:38.292
Yeah.

01:28:38.333 --> 01:28:40.919
So while you were studying
tired old hacks

01:28:40.919 --> 01:28:43.630
like Bundy, Gacy, and Dahmer,

01:28:43.630 --> 01:28:45.548
I was studying you.

01:28:45.632 --> 01:28:48.259
Your habits, your hang-ups,
your weaknesses.

01:28:48.343 --> 01:28:51.012
It was so simple
to set you all on edge.

01:28:53.431 --> 01:28:54.515
You know?

01:28:54.598 --> 01:28:56.517
I had to push here...

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:59.144
pull there...
but once I did...

01:28:59.144 --> 01:29:01.605
LUCAS: Hey, Vince, check out
the other side of town.

01:29:01.688 --> 01:29:03.940
I knew each of you
would play your part.

01:29:06.734 --> 01:29:09.195
The key to effective illusion
is misdirection.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.530
You know there's a bomb
on the boat.

01:29:10.696 --> 01:29:12.698
You don't run toward it
first in line.

01:29:12.782 --> 01:29:14.116
You know?

01:29:14.158 --> 01:29:15.868
All I needed was opportunity.

01:29:17.119 --> 01:29:19.246
The coffee break gave me
the chance I needed

01:29:19.246 --> 01:29:21.081
to rig a few little surprises.

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.251
The answer was
in front of your eyes.

01:29:25.335 --> 01:29:26.669
You still couldn't see it.

01:29:26.711 --> 01:29:29.213
It was you who said
to turn off the water.

01:29:29.255 --> 01:29:30.381
The rest was easy.

01:29:30.464 --> 01:29:33.509
You're all
so fucking predictable.

01:29:33.592 --> 01:29:35.010
Nicole with her cigarettes.

01:29:35.094 --> 01:29:38.305
Can't she even read
the warning label on the box?

01:29:39.014 --> 01:29:42.559
Vince...
"I'm never without my gun."

01:29:42.601 --> 01:29:45.895
Bobby the Magnificent
couldn't resist.

01:29:45.895 --> 01:29:49.357
And Harris
just had to stay and watch.

01:29:50.733 --> 01:29:53.319
Party crasher here was more
of a problem than I thought,

01:29:53.319 --> 01:29:56.864
but why am I gonna work
so hard to kill him

01:29:56.905 --> 01:29:58.865
when I knew you'd do it for me?

01:30:01.159 --> 01:30:04.996
You see, the water
ain't your only weakness, Sara.

01:30:05.038 --> 01:30:07.040
[Shuddering]

01:30:09.292 --> 01:30:11.460
Your other weakness...

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:13.003
is me.

01:30:40.821 --> 01:30:43.114
In truth, I couldn't have
done it without you.

01:30:43.198 --> 01:30:45.116
As a sign of my appreciation,
I'm gonna grant you

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.451
your deepest desire.

01:30:46.534 --> 01:30:50.997
I'm gonna get you closer to your
sister than you ever imagined.

01:30:55.209 --> 01:30:57.794
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi.

01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:06.135
- Are we having fun yet?
- [Gasping]

01:31:09.889 --> 01:31:11.015
Whoa.

01:31:24.903 --> 01:31:26.654
[Chuckling]

01:31:30.992 --> 01:31:32.660
[Gasps]

01:33:03.535 --> 01:33:04.744
[Gasps]

01:33:24.304 --> 01:33:25.597
Drop it!

01:33:29.517 --> 01:33:31.811
Go ahead, Sara.
Arrest me.

01:33:33.771 --> 01:33:36.940
We have your blood
under Rafe's fingernails.

01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:40.360
Your fingerprints
on the fire extinguisher.

01:33:40.444 --> 01:33:42.946
And your bullet in my neck.

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.157
That don't look good.

01:33:47.742 --> 01:33:49.494
You're fucked.

01:33:52.913 --> 01:33:54.331
[Ticking]

01:33:54.999 --> 01:33:57.417
- [Gasps]
- Time's up, asshole.

01:34:21.148 --> 01:34:23.441
Good thing you hit like a girl.

01:34:31.907 --> 01:34:34.493
I guess we found out
his weakness.

01:34:35.494 --> 01:34:37.287
Bullets.

01:34:48.381 --> 01:34:50.299
[Helicopter blades whirring]

01:35:05.897 --> 01:35:07.940
Do you think they'll let me
make profiler?

01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:11.402
That depends.
One last question.

01:35:12.695 --> 01:35:16.281
Whers the situation secure,
Agent?

01:35:17.116 --> 01:35:18.700
On the drive home.

01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:20.035
Yeah.

01:35:20.911 --> 01:35:22.495
On the drive home.
