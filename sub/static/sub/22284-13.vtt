00:10.301 --> 00:12.369
Go go!

00:17.074 --> 00:19.709
What the hell is wrong with
you, man? Why'd you do that?

00:19.744 --> 00:22.036
They were gonna
kill you, man!

00:22.070 --> 00:24.472
Now they're
gonna kill us all!

00:29.203 --> 00:31.071
<i>And with your
bowl-game news,</i>

00:31.105 --> 00:33.507
<i>let's go back
to aspn studios.</i>

00:33.542 --> 00:34.841
<i>Thanks again
for joing us</i>

00:34.875 --> 00:37.740
<i>and welcome back to the
2010 bcs bowl selection.</i>

00:37.774 --> 00:39.772
<i>I'm Ron Craig with
my co-host Julia King.</i>

00:39.807 --> 00:42.040
<i>Now, where better to
start off than Pasadena,</i>

00:42.074 --> 00:43.439
<i>the home of
the bowl game?</i>

00:43.473 --> 00:44.905
<i>Looks like
the ballots are in,</i>

00:44.940 --> 00:47.107
<i>and it'll be Texas taking on
Michigan in the rose bowl.</i>

00:47.141 --> 00:49.911
What? Seriously?

00:49.945 --> 00:52.548
Bullshit!

00:52.582 --> 00:55.020
- You hungry?
- I'm fine, man.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.560
Are you sure? I think we're
gonna be here for a while.

00:57.594 --> 00:59.761
Oh, I've got movies in my locker
if you want to pass the time.

00:59.795 --> 01:01.528
Why are you taking
this so lightly?

01:01.562 --> 01:02.629
This is a
big deal, man.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.998
- Is it, though?
- Yes.

01:04.032 --> 01:06.401
Mmm... We're 9 and 3,

01:06.435 --> 01:07.902
which means all the
big bowl games are out.

01:07.937 --> 01:10.205
What we do now is wait to see
if we get into another bowl game

01:10.239 --> 01:12.975
In a really fun city,
and we party our asses off

01:13.010 --> 01:14.379
For days on end.

01:14.413 --> 01:15.780
<i>Well, this one
is a real shocker.</i>

01:15.814 --> 01:18.383
<i>We just got word that
Blue Mountain State</i>

01:18.418 --> 01:20.552
<i>will face off against
Clementine University</i>

01:20.586 --> 01:22.488
<i>for the Cypress
bowl in Louisiana.</i>

01:24.358 --> 01:27.293
- Louisiana?
- That's ridiculous!

01:27.327 --> 01:28.460
They're 9 and 3.

01:28.494 --> 01:29.694
They should be in
the toilet bowl.

01:29.729 --> 01:31.963
- Louisiana!
- Yeah, man!

01:31.998 --> 01:34.031
This is better
than las vegas!

01:34.065 --> 01:35.432
Better than las vegas!

01:35.467 --> 01:36.800
Congrats, travis.

01:45.007 --> 01:47.943
Do we deserve to be in this
bowl? Is that your question?

01:47.977 --> 01:50.446
Well, first of all,
it's the system.

01:50.480 --> 01:53.116
We didn't choose it.
It chose us.

01:53.150 --> 01:55.117
And when you consider the
season and all the injuries,

01:55.152 --> 01:56.920
And the distractions,

01:56.954 --> 01:58.889
And the
convictions,

01:58.924 --> 02:02.059
Yeah, I think we do. We do
deserve to be in this bowl.

02:04.395 --> 02:07.431
Travis McKenna, starting qb
of Blue Mountain State,

02:07.465 --> 02:08.465
do you think
you can win?

02:08.499 --> 02:10.533
Do I think we can win?

02:10.568 --> 02:12.470
Let me put it this way:

02:12.504 --> 02:16.140
This very morning, our
lord jesus christ came to me

02:16.175 --> 02:18.843
And he told me
that I've been chosen

02:18.878 --> 02:21.447
To quarterback
this team to victory.

02:21.481 --> 02:24.917
Bms! Bms! Bms!

02:27.253 --> 02:29.854
Jesus christ!

02:29.889 --> 02:32.557
He looks exactly like
I thought he would.

03:12.231 --> 03:16.368
"Bms bowl game favoritism."

03:16.402 --> 03:18.637
Finally someone's
picking us to win.

03:18.671 --> 03:21.006
Favoritism doesn't mean that
they think we're gonna win.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.375
It means that they don't even
think we deserve to even be here.

03:23.409 --> 03:26.478
What? We're the defending
national champions.

03:26.512 --> 03:28.713
We belong in whatever
bowl we say we belong in.

03:28.748 --> 03:31.749
That should be the
headline right there!

03:31.784 --> 03:33.518
"We belong..."

03:33.552 --> 03:35.219
You're damn right!

03:37.622 --> 03:39.857
Oh, yeah, encourage
Thad. That always works.

03:39.891 --> 03:42.225
Well, he's right.
I didn't come to bms

03:42.260 --> 03:44.628
To play in some crappy bowl
that nobody's gonna watch.

03:44.662 --> 03:46.196
I came here
for the spotlight,

03:46.230 --> 03:47.564
And this weekend
I'm gonna have it

03:47.598 --> 03:49.232
No matter what
anybody says.

03:49.267 --> 03:51.802
You should try dogfighting. That
will get you the spotlight too!

03:53.004 --> 03:56.474
Oh, wait a minute.
Is that... Oh!

03:58.543 --> 03:59.844
Hey! Julia King?

03:59.878 --> 04:01.846
- Yeah.
- Hi, I'm Alex Moran,

04:01.880 --> 04:04.249
I'm the 2nd-string quarterback
for Blue Mountain State.

04:04.283 --> 04:05.817
Really big
fan of yours.

04:05.851 --> 04:08.119
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah. Yeah it is.

04:08.153 --> 04:09.153
How about I buy
you a drink?

04:09.188 --> 04:10.354
And then maybe
you can, like,

04:10.389 --> 04:11.455
Interview me
or something.

04:11.490 --> 04:13.090
Could be fun. Oh!

04:13.125 --> 04:14.759
We'll talk later.

04:14.793 --> 04:17.628
What did I just say
on the freakin' bus?

04:17.661 --> 04:19.262
"we're here?"

04:19.297 --> 04:20.630
- No media!
- Yeah.

04:20.665 --> 04:22.132
Moran, we win
this game,

04:22.166 --> 04:24.834
And our 9 and 3 season
is all but forgotten.

04:24.869 --> 04:28.505
And I'm one game
closer to Joepa's record.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.841
There can be absolutely no distractions,

04:30.876 --> 04:34.178
Especially distractions
like her.

04:34.213 --> 04:36.748
- She's just...
- do you understand me?

04:36.782 --> 04:39.485
- Yeah.
- All right. Get ready for the banquet.

04:39.519 --> 04:41.920
I have a speech
to write.

04:48.128 --> 04:50.729
Dude, tell that reporter to
stay away from us. Ah...

04:50.764 --> 04:52.331
We need to focus.

04:52.365 --> 04:55.067
Now you're just daring
me to go talk to her.

04:55.101 --> 04:59.170
And without further ado,
it is my pleasure to introduce

04:59.204 --> 05:01.606
Six-time national
champion,

05:01.640 --> 05:04.808
Coach Marty Daniels from
Blue Mountain State.

05:09.581 --> 05:12.550
I'd like to first thank
the cypress bowl committee

05:12.584 --> 05:16.988
For inviting us.
It's an honor to be here,

05:17.022 --> 05:19.857
Even though there's
a lot of folks out there

05:19.892 --> 05:24.062
Who feel we don't
deserve to be here.

05:24.096 --> 05:25.497
But we're gonna
prove them wrong

05:25.531 --> 05:27.666
When we kick
clementine's ass

05:27.701 --> 05:29.468
Up and down the
field tomorrow.

05:32.573 --> 05:34.808
We're gonna embarrass
you in front of your families.

05:34.842 --> 05:36.710
We're gonna embarrass you
in front of your friends.

05:36.744 --> 05:38.612
We're gonna embarrass
you in front of your fans.

05:38.646 --> 05:40.714
And we're gonna
humiliate you to the point

05:40.749 --> 05:43.851
You're not gonna want to come
out and play the 2nd half!

05:43.886 --> 05:46.954
Because this is bullshit!

05:50.091 --> 05:53.260
Lastly, I'd like to thank
the fine people of baton rouge

05:53.294 --> 05:56.296
for their hospitality. You guys
have been great. Thank you very much.

05:57.898 --> 06:00.266
- That's right, coach!
- Yes! Yes!

06:00.300 --> 06:03.235
Great speech,
coach! Coach!

06:05.005 --> 06:07.106
- What are you doing?
- Eating.

06:07.141 --> 06:08.875
Let me explain
something to you.

06:08.909 --> 06:10.042
Those d-bags
at clementine

06:10.077 --> 06:11.778
Will stop at nothing
to get an edge on us.

06:11.812 --> 06:14.180
They've probably already
poisoned all of our food.

06:14.214 --> 06:15.915
Jeez, I already ate!

06:15.950 --> 06:19.385
You're the mascot. Can't you
just call in sick or something?

06:19.419 --> 06:21.087
The point is, don't eat anything

06:21.121 --> 06:22.354
Unless you've prepared it yourself.

06:22.389 --> 06:23.589
Okay, fine.

06:23.623 --> 06:25.124
- I'm serious.
- All right, okay.

06:25.158 --> 06:27.293
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

06:27.327 --> 06:29.695
We just wanted to
wish you good luck,

06:29.729 --> 06:32.465
- And may the best team win.
- I'm sure you do.

06:32.499 --> 06:35.968
We just wish you would get
the hell out of my face!

06:36.002 --> 06:37.536
Get out of my face!

06:37.571 --> 06:40.539
Get out! Goodbye!

06:40.573 --> 06:42.875
- No no no.
- Don't even look back here!

06:42.909 --> 06:45.644
Forget about us!

06:45.679 --> 06:47.013
Why did you shoo
the girls away?

06:47.047 --> 06:49.048
Because all
they want to do

06:49.082 --> 06:50.516
Is take you back
to the hotel

06:50.550 --> 06:52.518
And have sex with
you all night long

06:52.552 --> 06:54.653
In any position you want
for as long as you want

06:54.688 --> 06:57.423
Just to tire you out.
It's called a tactic.

06:57.457 --> 07:00.126
- How do you know that?
- This is a bowl game, okay?

07:00.160 --> 07:01.795
This is the way
things are played.

07:01.829 --> 07:03.931
I gave the same mission to
our cheerleaders already.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.232
Really?

07:08.602 --> 07:10.336
I got some work to do.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.943
Excuse me, can
you do me a favor?

07:16.977 --> 07:18.277
Can you send
a drink over

07:18.311 --> 07:21.146
To that pretty young
lady in the red dress?

07:24.217 --> 07:27.219
That depends.
Does your friend mind

07:27.254 --> 07:29.021
If I send one to him?

07:29.056 --> 07:31.124
Him?

07:32.827 --> 07:34.327
Are you talking about me?

07:34.362 --> 07:36.496
You're even more
adorable than I thought.

07:36.531 --> 07:39.065
Over 2,000 all-purpose
yards this season,

07:39.100 --> 07:42.637
And you're still surprised when
a girl wants to buy you a drink.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.206
Meet me in the coat room.

07:47.109 --> 07:49.244
Well...

07:49.278 --> 07:51.412
It's a condom.

07:53.549 --> 07:55.750
Have fun.

07:57.686 --> 08:01.188
Oh, man! I can't believe
how big my game is tomorrow.

08:01.222 --> 08:02.789
Never had such
a big game.

08:02.824 --> 08:04.424
I better go home and get
a good night's sleep

08:04.458 --> 08:06.259
Or else I'll be too tired
for my big game tomorrow.

08:06.293 --> 08:07.427
You're a football player?

08:07.461 --> 08:10.297
Yep. Whoo!

08:10.331 --> 08:12.166
I really should
rest up, though.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.202
Aw, poor baby!

08:14.236 --> 08:16.404
Why don't you let us
tuck you in tonight?

08:16.438 --> 08:19.407
Just as long as you promise
not to have too much sex with me

08:19.441 --> 08:21.809
And tire me out for
my big game tomorrow.

08:21.844 --> 08:25.313
- Oh, we promise.
- Well, then, take me away.

08:28.283 --> 08:32.220
Um, so this is
off the record.

08:32.254 --> 08:33.754
I'm getting
wasted tonight

08:33.789 --> 08:35.389
And I was wondering
if you'd like to join me.

08:35.424 --> 08:37.225
Funny. I heard you're not
supposed to talk to me.

08:37.259 --> 08:41.261
That's probably why we should
go hide out in your hotel room.

08:41.296 --> 08:42.731
Who knows where
coach is?

08:42.765 --> 08:46.001
What's coach daniels's
rule on kissing the media?

08:46.035 --> 08:48.403
We didn't discuss that.

08:48.438 --> 08:50.239
Oh, good.

08:55.545 --> 08:58.514
Mm-hmm, yeah. We need to get to
your hotel room as soon as possible.

08:58.549 --> 08:59.916
I want an interview.

08:59.950 --> 09:01.251
- That's fine!
- With Craig Shilo.

09:01.285 --> 09:03.320
- Huh?
- If you can get that,

09:03.354 --> 09:07.257
Then maybe I can help you out with this.

09:07.291 --> 09:08.791
Mmm. Done.

09:08.826 --> 09:11.227
Beep beep beep!
Guess what I am!

09:11.261 --> 09:13.262
I'm an alarm clock.
It's time for bed!

09:13.296 --> 09:15.998
That means you. No,
no hot girls. No no no!

09:16.032 --> 09:17.432
- You know that!
- I'll keep in touch with you.

09:17.467 --> 09:19.134
<i>Don't mess with me!
I'm not kidding!</i>

09:19.168 --> 09:21.102
<i>Everybody
go to bed...!</i>

09:22.837 --> 09:26.006
You are great.

09:26.040 --> 09:29.009
See you around, stud.

09:44.759 --> 09:46.594
This is better
than vegas!

09:47.963 --> 09:49.998
But girls, wait.
I'm not even tied yet.

09:50.032 --> 09:51.399
You're gonna tie
me up, remember?

09:51.433 --> 09:54.302
We've had enough
of you, freak!

09:54.336 --> 09:57.372
Okay, well, I had sex
with all of you. Yep.

09:57.407 --> 09:59.742
What? Nice job!

09:59.776 --> 10:00.843
Thanks, buddy.

10:00.877 --> 10:02.144
- All of them?
- Yeah.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.558
- Police!
- What?

10:18.592 --> 10:19.993
That's him,
officers!

10:20.027 --> 10:21.661
He's the one who
raped me!

10:21.695 --> 10:23.496
What?

10:24.821 --> 10:27.455
Craig?
Is he here?

10:27.490 --> 10:28.990
I don't know.

10:30.425 --> 10:32.126
Craig?

10:35.063 --> 10:36.696
Lights out means
nighty-night.

10:36.731 --> 10:38.231
What's so hard to
understand about this?

10:38.265 --> 10:39.332
- Shh!
- You shh!

10:39.367 --> 10:40.967
You shh!
Look at this.

10:42.469 --> 10:43.870
Look at the lamp.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.571
Oh, shit,
they did it.

10:45.606 --> 10:47.240
Who did what?

10:47.274 --> 10:48.908
Clementine
kidnapped Shilo.

10:48.942 --> 10:51.311
Get ready for a
long night, ladies.

10:51.345 --> 10:54.681
It's game on.
Andale.

10:54.715 --> 10:57.150
Sir, there's been
a misunderstanding.

10:57.184 --> 11:01.488
Oh, I think we understand
things just fine.

11:01.523 --> 11:02.957
You getting all
this, rooster?

11:02.991 --> 11:04.492
Sure is, boss.

11:04.526 --> 11:05.793
You told me.

11:05.827 --> 11:07.562
Look, I need to make
a phone call.

11:07.596 --> 11:09.765
- Phones are busted.
- But I need to call a lawyer!

11:09.799 --> 11:11.801
How are you gonna
call your lawyer

11:11.835 --> 11:13.702
When I just told you
the phones are busted?

11:13.737 --> 11:16.138
I didn't do anything.

11:16.173 --> 11:20.876
We heard that one
before. Rooster,

11:20.911 --> 11:24.013
- Get the dogs.
- Dogs?

11:24.047 --> 11:26.882
Why would you tell
him to go get dogs?

11:26.916 --> 11:28.684
Rooster, don't
get any dogs!

11:28.719 --> 11:31.420
What do we need dogs for?

11:49.171 --> 11:51.172
This is a
clementine party?

11:51.206 --> 11:53.641
We get a 10:00 curfew
and they get this?

11:53.675 --> 11:55.009
Yeah. It's
what separates

11:55.043 --> 11:56.777
The champions
from the losers.

11:56.811 --> 11:58.745
Yeah, but who's who
in this situation?

11:58.780 --> 12:01.114
- You're about to be, if...
- Look, Alex, there's your girl!

12:03.183 --> 12:06.318
Shit! Is she here? I can't
let her see me like this.

12:06.353 --> 12:07.821
Do you want to get
Shilo back or not?

12:07.855 --> 12:09.588
- Yes, I want to get Shilo back.
- All right!

12:09.623 --> 12:12.926
Then do exactly
as I say. Let's go.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.428
Wait wait wait.
Wait.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.601
O captain,
my captain.

12:20.636 --> 12:23.771
Does the red rabbit run
faster than the gazelle?

12:23.806 --> 12:25.106
Indeed it does.

12:25.141 --> 12:28.809
But the butterfly drinks
rainbow electricity.

12:28.844 --> 12:32.279
Nice!

12:32.313 --> 12:33.747
What the hell
just happened?

12:33.781 --> 12:37.150
I don't know. I don't
care. Let's go find Shilo.

12:37.185 --> 12:39.820
Hey, you guys can't leave.
I just told you to follow me.

12:39.854 --> 12:41.521
Idiots!

12:54.001 --> 12:56.536
We have a problem here.

12:58.639 --> 13:02.074
What you been telling
us just don't add up.

13:02.109 --> 13:03.409
It's math.

13:03.443 --> 13:05.044
Look, man, it's
like I told you.

13:05.078 --> 13:06.879
That girl came on to
me at the banquet.

13:06.914 --> 13:11.084
Enough with the words!
I'm getting tired of words,

13:11.118 --> 13:12.919
Always coming out
of people's mouths,

13:12.953 --> 13:14.754
Trying to convince
me of something.

13:14.788 --> 13:18.124
Well, you want to
convince me?

13:18.158 --> 13:19.292
Drink.

13:21.161 --> 13:24.898
I can't drink that.

13:24.932 --> 13:26.399
Look, I got
a game tomorrow.

13:29.003 --> 13:31.938
Now you've gone and
pissed the dogs off!

13:39.647 --> 13:43.049
Oh, man, I have to punt
so many punts tomorrow,

13:43.084 --> 13:45.252
I really hope I don't
pull a muscle

13:45.286 --> 13:47.054
While I'm punting for
Blue Mountain State.

13:47.088 --> 13:48.588
Nice try, loser.

13:48.623 --> 13:50.090
We know you're
just the mascot.

13:50.124 --> 13:52.559
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

13:52.593 --> 13:55.228
Uh, yeah, it's, like,
the worst thing.

13:55.262 --> 13:56.462
- Oh, well guess what?
- What?

13:56.496 --> 13:59.999
I have crabs!
Enjoy them!

14:13.481 --> 14:15.048
Hey! I'm looking
for Craig Shilo.

14:15.082 --> 14:17.550
- Never heard of him.
- What?

14:17.584 --> 14:19.485
You were just with...

14:19.519 --> 14:21.820
What did I tell you about talking
to clementine girls, Moran?

14:21.855 --> 14:24.923
The last time I saw Craig, he was
sneaking around with that girl.

14:24.958 --> 14:27.059
- That girl?
- Yeah, that girl.

14:27.094 --> 14:30.030
- That girl was with Shilo tonight?
- Yes. Why?

14:30.064 --> 14:31.732
Why does no one
listen to me?

14:31.766 --> 14:34.268
She set him up.

14:34.302 --> 14:35.903
She banged him and
accused him of rape.

14:35.937 --> 14:37.605
That's crazy!

14:37.640 --> 14:39.941
No! That is crazy! What
makes you think that?

14:39.975 --> 14:42.811
Because I had the same idea. I just
couldn't find a girl who would do it.

14:42.845 --> 14:47.181
- Are you insane?
- What is your problem? People get set up.

14:47.216 --> 14:50.551
The only difference is that when
I do it, we win football games.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.119
You're welcome!

14:52.154 --> 14:54.354
Oh, my God! We
gotta go help Craig!

14:54.389 --> 14:56.523
- Just a minute.
- What? We gotta go help him!

14:56.557 --> 14:58.658
I just want to
see something.

15:12.139 --> 15:13.507
Nice work, boys!

15:15.010 --> 15:18.313
My work here is done.
Let's go save Shilo.

15:28.992 --> 15:30.225
Let me get
this straight.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.927
Your teammate is
wrongfully arrested

15:31.961 --> 15:34.129
And you retaliate by
poisoning everyone's food.

15:34.164 --> 15:36.065
No, I did that before I
knew about the charges.

15:36.099 --> 15:37.967
I just thought they kidnapped him.

15:38.001 --> 15:39.535
- Worked out pretty good, though.
- Yeah.

15:39.569 --> 15:42.538
Those bastards did it, Alex!

15:42.572 --> 15:45.241
- Sammy, it wasn't...
- Well, let's make those a-holes pay.

15:45.275 --> 15:46.375
Let's do it!

15:46.410 --> 15:47.376
There they are!

15:47.411 --> 15:48.945
Go go go!

15:53.272 --> 15:54.672
What are we doing?

15:54.707 --> 15:55.974
We gotta break
Shilo out of jail.

15:56.008 --> 15:57.075
We need him
for the game.

15:57.109 --> 15:58.644
- What?
- Damn right!

15:58.678 --> 16:01.180
We're not even gonna
make it to the game!

16:01.214 --> 16:03.783
The clementine people you
poisoned are now gonna kill us!

16:03.817 --> 16:06.719
Yeah, good luck
finding us.

16:13.593 --> 16:16.294
I told you everything I could. I swear.

16:16.328 --> 16:19.196
Do you want Kevin
to kill that chicken?

16:19.231 --> 16:20.597
He'll do it!

16:20.632 --> 16:24.101
What? Kevin, don't
kill that chicken.

16:24.135 --> 16:26.103
Kill the chicken, Kevin!

16:26.137 --> 16:30.141
- He don't want to talk!
- No, Kevin, don't kill that chicken!

16:30.175 --> 16:32.877
Don't you kill that chicken, Kevin!

16:32.912 --> 16:35.948
All right.

16:35.982 --> 16:38.317
Good luck with the
game today, champ.

16:41.388 --> 16:44.124
- Wait. What?
- He said have a great game.

16:44.158 --> 16:47.226
- You're free to go.
- What about the charges?

16:47.261 --> 16:49.328
Oh, charges
are dropped.

16:49.363 --> 16:52.064
You gotta go play
your football game.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.600
If you can still walk.

17:03.642 --> 17:05.576
Okay, there it is...
The police station.

17:05.609 --> 17:09.480
Thad, they're not gonna let us
just walk in there and grab him.

17:09.515 --> 17:13.318
No, you're right.
That's not gonna work.

17:13.352 --> 17:14.417
We're gonna have to
do this the hard way.

17:17.755 --> 17:19.388
All right, screw it.

17:19.424 --> 17:21.191
I'm not asking
any more questions.

17:21.224 --> 17:23.727
You're my captain.
Let's get him out.

17:23.761 --> 17:26.496
Thank you for finally
believing in me.

17:45.051 --> 17:47.818
Jesus christ! What the
hell is wrong with you?

17:47.853 --> 17:50.855
I think we're gonna
have to go with plan b.

17:53.191 --> 17:55.359
What could possibly
be plan b?

18:03.400 --> 18:06.736
- Oh my God! He's punching cops!
- He's punching cops!

18:17.616 --> 18:19.251
Shilo, let's go!

18:35.367 --> 18:37.934
How far back are they?

18:47.478 --> 18:50.080
What the hell is wrong with
you, man? Why'd you do that?

18:50.114 --> 18:52.049
They were gonna
kill you, man!

18:52.083 --> 18:54.585
Now they're
gonna kill us all!

18:55.873 --> 18:58.342
I don't understand. When was
the last time you saw them?

18:58.376 --> 19:00.577
They were in their rooms
at 10:00 last night.

19:00.612 --> 19:02.312
Jeez!

19:05.651 --> 19:07.585
- Craig, I need you to do me a favor.
- What?

19:07.620 --> 19:09.254
If we get out of this, I
need you to do an interview

19:09.288 --> 19:11.356
with Julia King
before the game.

19:11.390 --> 19:13.292
If we get out of this
I'll do anything. Let's go!

19:13.326 --> 19:14.326
Okay, good. I'm gonna
hold you to that.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.762
Move!

19:40.356 --> 19:43.191
- Can you play?
- Yes, coach.

19:43.226 --> 19:45.393
Hey, can you play?

19:45.427 --> 19:47.195
Yes, coach.

19:47.229 --> 19:50.197
- Can you play?
- I don't play football.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.399
Can you play?

19:52.434 --> 19:55.203
I could, but I don't
know why it matters.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.805
Well, it does matter,
because jesus forgot to tell

19:57.840 --> 20:01.210
Our starting quarterback
about food poisoning.

20:04.781 --> 20:06.683
Congratulations.
You're starting today.

20:09.554 --> 20:11.455
That stupid
piece of shit.

20:12.990 --> 20:15.324
Julia?

20:15.359 --> 20:17.727
Oh, yeah, Shilo, I need
you to give miss king here

20:17.761 --> 20:20.262
- an interview before the game.
- No problem, coach.
