13:30.120 --> 13:32.200
(SCOFFS) That old excuse?

13:33.680 --> 13:36.240
It was me who cursed you
in the first place.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.600
I only wanted you to be with your mom.

13:38.760 --> 13:44.360
Then I found out she was a tree,
and... turns out I did that too.

13:44.560 --> 13:48.440
Tara...
I’m sorry. Really, really sorry!

13:48.640 --> 13:51.920
Can we keep it down out here?
Some of us are busy moulting!

If a meteorite does not enter this house
in the next thirty seconds,

14:07.880 --> 14:09.880
we must consider the task failed.

14:12.600 --> 14:15.040
We grab her
when they take her off to the bog.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.040
Open the bog-well in the kitchen.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.920
-Or some other plan.
-We have a bog well. That makes sense.

you’re not really going to do this?

14:26.000 --> 14:29.360
Okay. I really hate to be that person,
But the person

14:29.560 --> 14:32.920
who should be standing here is--
(SHATTERING SOUND)

14:33.040 --> 14:35.000
Huh! What are the odds?

14:38.360 --> 14:40.200
It appears to be a meteorite!

14:40.360 --> 14:41.880
How can you be sure?

14:42.000 --> 14:43.760
Got a plaque on it that says so.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.440
From the Museum? That does not count.

14:46.640 --> 14:50.600
-It is meant to come from--
-It is still a meteorite.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.640
You have completed the second task!

14:54.000 --> 14:55.120
How did you do that?

14:55.280 --> 14:58.360
Easy when you’ve got a friend
who can fly over the house.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.640
In owl form, I’m actually very buff.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.200
Now, for the third task.
You will be dropped into the bog-well.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.360
-Say what?
-You said that would happen

15:08.560 --> 15:10.280
if she didn’t do the test!

15:10.440 --> 15:14.240
Don’t worry, she only has to sew herself
coming out safely from the bog.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.160
What could be easier?

15:16.320 --> 15:20.800
-Huh. Tara.
-I know. I know...

15:24.040 --> 15:26.360
Bridget, sorry,
Bella’s about to get bogged

15:26.560 --> 15:30.160
and you’re the only one
who can... You’re up?

15:30.320 --> 15:32.120
And leaving!

15:32.280 --> 15:37.680
The situation may be a little more
advanced than I led you to believe.

15:37.840 --> 15:41.120
But I needed to be sure
you’d let me gather my strength.

15:41.280 --> 15:44.920
Aunt Bridget, please.
Bella only ever pretended to be Supreme

15:45.040 --> 15:47.800
because I asked her.
If she gets dropped in the bog,

15:47.960 --> 15:51.200
-it’ll be my fault.
-This is a war

15:51.360 --> 15:55.360
between good and evil.

15:57.920 --> 16:02.400
-And all wars have casualties.
-You couldn’t forgive the Circle

16:02.600 --> 16:05.240
for not saving your sister
when it had the chance.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.640

-Very amusing, Great One!

16:21.000 --> 16:24.400
-The real one’s on her way now!
-What? In the house?

16:24.600 --> 16:25.840
-No, no!
-Please don’t!

16:47.160 --> 16:51.080
-I forbid you to punish her.
-Prove it.

16:52.200 --> 16:56.600
Of course. Weaving a prediction
that allows me to pass through the bog

16:56.760 --> 16:58.600
is no problem for me.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.600
No problem at all.

No.
