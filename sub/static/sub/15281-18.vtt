WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:05.568
PREVIOUSLY ON
CRIMINAL MINDS...

00:05.600 --> 00:08.398
PLEASE, I DON'T WANT IT.
I DON'T WANT IT.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.738
IT HELPS.

00:22.550 --> 00:23.744
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

00:23.790 --> 00:26.350
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

00:26.390 --> 00:27.709
I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU
ACT LIKE THIS.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.159
REALLY? OH, IN THE MONTHS
THAT YOU KNOW ME,

00:29.190 --> 00:31.055
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ME
ACT THIS WAY?

00:31.090 --> 00:32.193
HEY, NO OFFENSE, EMILY,
BUT...

00:32.230 --> 00:35.393
YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, DO YOU?

00:35.430 --> 00:38.695
EARLIER THIS MORNING
KATRINA CRASHED INTO
THE GULF COAST,

00:38.730 --> 00:41.665
WITH SUSTAINED WINDS
ABOVE 125 AN HOUR.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.304
AS MANY HOUSES
ARE BEING DESTROYED.

00:43.340 --> 00:45.763
RESIDENTS ARE TRYING
TO EVACUATE.

00:50.810 --> 00:51.742
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME, POP?

00:51.780 --> 00:53.611
GRAB YOUR WALLET AND GET
THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

00:53.650 --> 00:54.719
THE BUSES ARE FILLING UP.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.389
THIS CASE IS EATIN'
AT ME, BILLY.

00:57.420 --> 00:57.909
DAD.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.178
FORGET THE DAMN CASE.

00:59.220 --> 01:00.756
WHAT THE HELL
AM I MISSING HERE?

01:00.790 --> 01:03.350
DAD, PEOPLE ARE DROWNING
IN THEIR HOMES.

01:03.390 --> 01:06.621
THE WHOLE WORLD'S
GONNA BE UNDERWATER.

01:06.660 --> 01:07.820
I GOT ANOTHER LETTER,
BILLY.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.420
SCREW THE LE'I'I'ER.
FORGET THE SERIAL KILLER.

01:10.470 --> 01:11.823
THEY'RE OPENING
THE SUPERDOME.

01:11.870 --> 01:13.497
I WANT YOU TO MEET ME THERE.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.496
I'LL BE DAMNED.

01:15.540 --> 01:17.428
PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU, POP.

01:18.910 --> 01:21.572
POP

01:58.810 --> 02:01.608
WE'VE GOT A SERIAL KILLER
IN NEW ORLEANS

02:01.650 --> 02:04.141
WHO KILLED AT LEAST 3 MEN
PRE-KATRINA.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.317
UNTIL NOW, THE NEW ORLEANS
POLICE DEPARTMENT

02:06.360 --> 02:08.658
BELIEVED THAT THE SERIAL KILLER
DIED IN THE STORM.

02:08.690 --> 02:09.782
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO TELL THEM OTHERWISE?

02:09.830 --> 02:12.856
A FOURTH BODY WAS FOUND IN
THE FRENCH QUARTER LAST NIGHT.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.152
SAME M.O. ANOTHER MALE.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.599
THROAT SLASH ED, EVISCERATED.

02:16.630 --> 02:18.791
A YEAR AND A HALF?
THAT'S A LONG
COOLING-OFF PERIOD.

02:18.830 --> 02:21.162
ARE WE SURE THIS IS
THE SAME UNSUB?

02:21.200 --> 02:21.996
HE CLAIMS TO BE.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.359
HE SENT A LETTER
TO WILLIAM LAMONTAGNE,

02:23.410 --> 02:25.207
THE HEAD DETECTIVE
ON THE CASE.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.798
DOES LAMONTAGNE
HAVE ANY LEADS?

02:26.840 --> 02:28.569
HE DIED IN KATRINA.

02:28.610 --> 02:31.579
HIS SON IS ACTUALLY
LEADING THE CASE NOW.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.417
HMM. THAT CAN'T BE EASY.

02:32.450 --> 02:33.917
WELL, WE NEED TO POUR OVER
THE EVIDENCE

02:33.950 --> 02:35.918
FROM THE FIRST 3 MURDERS
AND DETERMINE THE PATTERN.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.781
KATRINA WASH ED
EVERYTHING AWAY.

02:37.820 --> 02:41.813
THE 3 VICTIMS WE KNOW OF,
THEIR AUTOPSY REPORTS,

02:41.860 --> 02:43.350
WITNESS STATEMENTS.

02:43.390 --> 02:44.482
DNA TEST RESULTS.

02:44.530 --> 02:47.522
SO, BASICALLY, ALL WE HAVE
TO GO ON IS THE LATEST VICTIM?

02:47.860 --> 02:48.758
YEAH.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.529
UNTIL HE KILLS AGAIN.

03:14.960 --> 03:20.648
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE
BY CBS

03:28.000 --> 03:28.989
ROBERT KENNEDY ONCE SAID,

03:29.040 --> 03:32.237
"TRAGEDY IS A TOOL
FOR THE LIVING
TO GAIN WISDOM,

03:32.280 --> 03:35.636
NOT A GUIDE
BY WHICH TO LIVE."

03:37.510 --> 03:38.909
HEY, REID.

03:38.950 --> 03:39.871
WHAT'S GOIN' ON UP THERE?

03:39.920 --> 03:42.343
I WAS JUST THINKING
OF THIS OLD FRIEND OF MINE

03:42.390 --> 03:43.982
FROM LAS VEGAS--ETHAN.

03:44.020 --> 03:46.955
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE LIVES IN NEW ORLEANS NOW.

03:46.990 --> 03:48.014
REALLY

03:48.060 --> 03:49.425
GREW UP COMPETING
AGAINST EACH OTHER

03:49.460 --> 03:50.552
IN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

03:50.590 --> 03:51.784
SPELLING BEES, SCIENCE FAIRS.

03:51.830 --> 03:55.857
WE ALSO BOTH HAD OUR HEARTS SET
ON JOINING THE BUREAU, BUT...

03:55.900 --> 03:57.959
FIRST DAY AT QUANTICO
HE BACKED OUT.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.867
HE PROBABLY JUST COULDN'T
TAKE THE HEAT.

04:00.900 --> 04:04.267
IT'S NOT REALLY
FOR US TO JUDGE, IS IT?

04:04.610 --> 04:05.736
RIGHT.

04:05.770 --> 04:06.930
MY BAD.

04:06.980 --> 04:10.279
THESE ARE COPIES
OF THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES
ON THE MURDERS,

04:10.310 --> 04:12.369
DATING BACK
TO EARLY AUGUST 2005.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.717
IT'S ALL WE HAVE TO GO ON.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.843
HE KILLED 3 TIMES,
HE STOPPED FOR 18 MONTHS,

04:15.880 --> 04:17.484
THEN HE STARTED
KILLING AGAIN.

04:17.520 --> 04:18.839
WE SHOULD HAVE GARCIA
RUN A LIST

04:18.890 --> 04:19.959
OF ANY OFFENDERS
IN THE AREA.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.756
OR ANYONE THAT RELOCATED
AFTER KATRINA
AND RECENTLY MOVED BACK.

04:25.790 --> 04:29.055
WHAT IS THE VICTIMOLOGY
IN KILLING A MECHANIC,

04:29.100 --> 04:30.863
A REAL ESTATE BROKER,
AND A COOK,

04:30.900 --> 04:33.596
WITH AGES RANGING
FROM 22 TO 45?

04:33.640 --> 04:36.564
AND THIS LATEST
IS A 33-YEAR-OLD TAXI DRIVER.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.908
THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO HAVE
VERY MUCH IN COMMON.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.999
BESIDES BEING MALE AND
WALKING THE FRENCH QUARTER
LATE AT NIGHT.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.577
WHICH IS NOTORIOUS FOR MUGGINGS
OFF THE MAIN DRAG.

04:43.610 --> 04:47.569
YEAH, BUT THIS GUY ISN'T
IN A RUSH TO FLEE THE SCENE.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.939
A SLAUGHTER LIKE THIS
TAKES TIME.

04:48.980 --> 04:51.687
ANDREI CHIKATILO FANTASIZED
THAT THE MEN HE KILLED
WERE HIS CAPTIVES

04:51.720 --> 04:53.688
AND THEN TORTURING
AND MUTILATING THEM

04:53.720 --> 04:54.709
SOMEHOW MADE HIM A HERO.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.580
THE CITY'S BARELY
BACK TO LIFE.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.053
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
COULD CRIPPLE ITS PSYCHE.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.296
SO WHERE DO WE START?

05:00.330 --> 05:04.391
WELL, WITH NO CASE FILE
THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE
WE CAN START.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.596
AT SQUARE ONE.

05:11.140 --> 05:14.405
YOU MUST BE B.A.U.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.304
BILL LAMONTAGNE.

05:15.340 --> 05:17.547
HI. JENNIFER JAREAU.
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE.

05:17.580 --> 05:19.969
WELL, OK, THEN.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.908
I PICTURED YOU DIFFERENT.

05:21.950 --> 05:24.748
UH, THESE ARE AGENTS
GIDEON AND MORGAN.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.758
THIS IS DETECTIVE
WILLIAM LAMONTAGNE JR.

05:26.790 --> 05:29.429
APPRECIATE YOU GUYS
BEING HERE.

05:29.460 --> 05:32.349
MY DADDY WAS TOO STUBBORN
TO EVER ASK FOR ANY HELP.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.550
SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.122
I UNDERSTAND
YOU RECEIVED A LETTER.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.922
YEAH. BEFORE THEY WERE LOST
IN KATRINA,

05:38.970 --> 05:40.892
MY DADDY RECEIVED
2 LETTERS.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.659
THIS ONE CAME ADDRESSED
TO HIM YESTERDAY.

05:43.710 --> 05:44.438
THEY PASSED IT ON TO ME.

05:44.470 --> 05:46.028
YOU SURE IT'S FROM
THE SAME KILLER?

05:46.070 --> 05:47.537
IT'S A DETAILED ACCOUNT

05:47.580 --> 05:48.933
OF WHAT HE DID
TO THE BODY.

05:48.980 --> 05:53.417
4 LAYERS OF FATTY TISSUE
SLICED THROUGH LIKE BUTTER.

05:53.450 --> 05:55.645
I ONLY SEEN THAT
3 OTHER TIMES.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.510
YOU WORK THIS CASE
INITIALLY?

05:56.550 --> 05:59.678
NAH. YOU DON'T FORGET
VICTIMS LIKE THIS.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.516
IT'S LIKE
THEY WERE DISSECT ED.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.778
I CAN STILL SMELL
THE ALCOHOL ON HIM.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.728
THIS IS NEW ORLEANS.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.580
DEAD OR ALIVE, IT'S
A SMELL YOU GET USED TO.

06:05.630 --> 06:07.450
THE VICTIM HAS NO
DEFENSE WOUNDS.

06:07.500 --> 06:11.459
MEANING THIS IS MOST
LIKELY A BLITZ ATTACK.

06:13.640 --> 06:17.030
NO HESITATION MARKS
OR RAPID THRUSTS.

06:17.070 --> 06:18.833
CUTS WERE METHODICAL.

06:18.870 --> 06:19.837
ALMOST PROCEDURAL.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.940
MY GUESS--WHOEVER GUTTED
THIS GUY WAS TAUGHT TO.

06:22.980 --> 06:24.504
SO YOU THINK HE MIGHT HAVE
SOME MEDICAL TRAINING?

06:24.550 --> 06:26.677
HOW ELSE COULD HE
CARVE AROUND EVERY ORGAN

06:26.720 --> 06:27.709
AND LEAVE EACH ONE INTACT?

06:27.750 --> 06:30.583
HAVE ANY OF HIS RELATIVES
COME TO CLAIM THE BODY?

06:30.620 --> 06:31.644
ANYONE WE COULD SPEAK WITH?

06:31.690 --> 06:34.579
NO. I'LL END UP BOXING UP
THE POOR BASTARD'S ASHES,

06:34.620 --> 06:36.485
LEFT TO COLLECT DUST
IN STORAGE.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.828
ALL THE BODIES I'VE BEEN THROUGH
IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF,

06:38.860 --> 06:42.569
IT'S A WONDER
I STILL HAVE ROOM.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.967
IT'D BE PRETTY EASY
TO HIDE OUT
IN ONE OF THESE ALCOVES,

06:50.010 --> 06:51.864
WAIT FOR THE VICTIM
WITHOUT EVER BEING SEEN.

06:51.910 --> 06:54.936
YEAH, ALL 4 MURDERS
OCCURRED WITHIN
A 10-BLOCK RADIUS

06:54.980 --> 06:56.129
HERE INSIDE
THE FRENCH QUARTER.

06:56.180 --> 06:59.718
ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT,
THERE'D HAVE TO BE
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

06:59.750 --> 07:01.217
WALKING THROUGH HERE
FROM THE BARS.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.717
TENS OF THOUSANDS.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.183
WHEN I FIRST STARTED
AS A COP,

07:04.220 --> 07:05.141
I WORKED THE QUARTER.

07:05.190 --> 07:06.919
IT'S LIKE BEING
IN THE RIOT SQUAD EVERY NIGHT.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.622
EVERY SUNDAY I'D GET OFF WORK
AROUND SUNRISE,

07:09.660 --> 07:10.752
I'M READY TO PASS OUT,

07:10.790 --> 07:12.929
MY DADDY'D BE WAITING FOR ME
AT MY HOUSE.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.599
MAKE ME DRIVE HIM UPTOWN
TO FRANKIE AND JOHNNY'S

07:15.630 --> 07:16.426
FOR POORBOYS.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.222
CALLED IT COMMUNING
WITH NEW ORLEANS.

07:18.270 --> 07:21.592
DID YOUR FATHER TELL YOU
ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS CASE

07:21.640 --> 07:22.732
THAT WE SHOULD KNOW?

07:22.770 --> 07:23.634
HE TRIED TO.

07:23.670 --> 07:26.798
BUT YOU GUYS SHOULD
SEE THAT FOR YOURSELF.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.741
THIS WALL IS STILL STANDING
WHERE DADDY CARVED THE MESSAGE

07:33.780 --> 07:36.681
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

07:38.650 --> 07:42.950
THERE'S NO DOUBT
HE'S STILL WORKING
FROM THE GRAVE.

07:43.260 --> 07:46.627
"JONES." THAT NAME
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

07:46.660 --> 07:48.025
NO. I RAN IT THROUGH
THE DATABASE

07:48.060 --> 07:49.869
AGAINST EVERY OFFENDER
IN NEW ORLEANS.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.891
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE
HOW MANY HITS I GOT.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.933
BUT NOTHING CAME UP
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CASE.

07:54.970 --> 07:55.994
BUT IN YOUR DAD'S
FINAL MOMENTS,

07:56.040 --> 07:58.804
IT WAS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING
HE WANTED TO SAY.

07:58.840 --> 08:02.674
LEARNED HOW TO PLAY
THE DRUMS IN THIS HOUSE,

08:02.710 --> 08:05.543
GREW UP WITH 2 DOGS
IN THIS HOUSE.

08:05.580 --> 08:08.777
ALL IT'S GONNA BE NOW
IS THE WORD "JONES"
CARVED INTO THAT WALL.

08:08.820 --> 08:11.118
DETECTIVE, IF HE HAD
WRITTEN THE UNSUB'S NAME,

08:11.150 --> 08:12.981
I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE
FOUND HIM BY NOW.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.715
JONES IS THE ONE PIECE
OF THE PUZZLE

08:14.760 --> 08:15.852
THAT YOUR DADDY DID KNOW.

08:15.890 --> 08:18.723
HE TRUSTED YOU
TO FIGURE OUT THE REST.

08:18.760 --> 08:19.556
YEAH, I KNOW IT.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.522
BUT I'VE PORED OVER IT
A THOUSAND TIMES

08:24.100 --> 08:28.196
I CAN'T GET IT
OUT OF MY HEAD.

08:30.970 --> 08:32.870
YOU OK?

08:32.910 --> 08:33.899
YEAH.

08:33.940 --> 08:38.070
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT HIM.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.884
IS THAT THE LETTER
FROM THE UNSUB?

08:43.920 --> 08:44.818
YEAH.

08:44.850 --> 08:45.782
"I'M BACK WITH A VENGEANCE.

08:45.820 --> 08:46.787
"I WANTED YOU TO KNOW.

08:46.820 --> 08:49.721
"THE LAST GUY
MADE IT EASY,
BEING OUT SO LATE,

08:49.760 --> 08:50.749
"STUMBLING HOME DRUNK.

08:50.790 --> 08:52.792
"I ENJOYED SLICING
AROUND HIS ORGANS.

08:52.830 --> 08:53.819
"I THOUGHT ABOUT
SENDING YOU ONE.

08:53.860 --> 08:57.626
"HE WAS ASKING TO BE RIPPED,
DON'T YOU THINK, BOSS?

08:57.670 --> 08:58.796
YOURS TRULY."

08:58.830 --> 08:59.831
HEY.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.531
OK.

09:03.170 --> 09:05.809
TO SAY THAT THE VICTIMS
WERE ASKING TO BE KILLED

09:05.840 --> 09:06.829
DENIES ALL CULPABILITY.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.768
MOST SEXUAL SADISTS
RATIONALIZE THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR

09:08.810 --> 09:09.708
BY BLAMING THE VICTIMS
LIKE THAT.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.775
BUT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT

09:11.810 --> 09:12.742
IN THE AUTOPSY.

09:12.780 --> 09:14.975
HE COULD BE
A HOMOSEXUAL MALE

09:15.020 --> 09:17.739
STABBING BECAUSE
HE NEEDS VIOLENCE
FOR AROUSAL.

09:17.790 --> 09:21.157
EVERY KILL HE'S ACTING OUT
A FANTASY OF REVENGE.

09:21.190 --> 09:23.727
WHAT IF HE'S TRYING
TO ACT OUT SOMETHING ELSE?

09:23.760 --> 09:26.251
EXCEPT FOR THE VICTIMS WERE MEN,
IT'S THE SAME M.O.

09:26.290 --> 09:27.552
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:27.600 --> 09:30.262
ALL 4 VICTIMS WERE FOUND
WITH THEIR THROATS SLASHED,
EVISCERATED,

09:30.300 --> 09:33.861
AND THE MURDERS PERPETRATED
IN SEMI-PUBLIC PLACES
AFTER DARK.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.334
INVESTIGATORS TAU NTED
WITH THE LETTERS ADDRESSED
TO "BOSS."

09:36.370 --> 09:38.338
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS
THAT CASE WAS
100 YEARS AGO

09:38.370 --> 09:40.930
AND THE MURDERS
TOOK PLACE IN LONDON.

09:41.310 --> 09:42.743
JACK THE RIPPER.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.179
THE UNSUB WANTS US TO THINK

09:44.210 --> 09:47.373
THAT HE'S THE MODERN-DAY VERSION
LOOSE IN NEW ORLEANS.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.638
PLEASE.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.646
NO!

10:07.000 --> 10:09.969
SO THE 3 OF YOU WERE
OUT TOGETHER LAST NIGHT?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.204
MARK HAD JUST PAID
HIS TAB AT ONE BAR

10:11.240 --> 10:12.969
AND HE WAS ON HIS WAY
TO MEET US AT ANOTHER.

10:13.010 --> 10:15.001
YOU GUYS GET
IN ANY TROUBLE?

10:15.040 --> 10:17.372
DRUNKEN BRAWL

10:17.410 --> 10:19.401
WE WERE JUST OUT
TO HAVE FUN, YOU KNOW?

10:19.450 --> 10:20.712
MINDED OUR OWN BUSINESS.

10:20.750 --> 10:21.978
COULD MARK HAVE MET A GIRL?

10:22.020 --> 10:23.681
MAYBE UPSET HER BOYFRIEND?

10:23.720 --> 10:24.379
NO, SIR.

10:24.420 --> 10:27.116
HE STRUCK OUT
LIKE WE ALL DID.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.253
THAN KS, GUYS.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.158
GETTING HARD TO KEEP UP
WITH THIS GUY.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.725
WELL, IF HE'S MIMICKING
JACK THE RIPPER,

10:36.770 --> 10:38.829
THAT MIGHT BE PRECISELY
THE POINT.

10:38.870 --> 10:40.235
HE TERRORIZED LONDON
FOR MONTHS

10:40.270 --> 10:41.134
WITHOUT EVER GETTING CAUGHT.

10:41.170 --> 10:42.967
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF
YOU'D GATHER YOUR MEN.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.036
WE'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU
A PROFILE OF WHO
YOU'RE UP AGAINST.

10:46.070 --> 10:49.278
THE OFFENDER WE'RE
LOOKING FOR IS FRIENDLY,

10:49.310 --> 10:52.438
AGILE, SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN 30 AND 35.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.914
HE'LL ALLURE WITH CHARM

10:54.950 --> 10:55.939
AND KILL WITH RAGE.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.016
WE BELIEVE
HE'S MURDERING MEN

10:58.050 --> 10:58.880
TO RECLAIM HIS POWER.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.319
THIS UNSUB SUFFERS
FROM LOW SELF-ESTEEM,

11:00.360 --> 11:01.918
BUT HE PROBABLY
COVERS IT WELL.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.929
HE DRESSES IMPECCABLY
TO FEED THE FACADE.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.086
JACK THE RIPPER HIMSELF

11:06.130 --> 11:08.189
WAS AN IMPETUOUS
LUST MURDERER,

11:08.230 --> 11:12.166
WHEREAS THIS OFFENDER
IS ORGANIZED,

11:12.200 --> 11:13.030
CALCULATING.

11:13.070 --> 11:15.834
HE MIGHT EVEN
STALK HIS VICTIMS FOR DAYS

11:15.870 --> 11:18.009
BEFORE THE ACTUAL KILL.

11:19.210 --> 11:22.839
WE BELIEVE THIS KILLER
IDENTIFIES WITH
JACK THE RIPPER

11:22.880 --> 11:25.747
BECAUSE HE'S LOST
HIS OWN IDENTITY.

11:25.780 --> 11:28.908
MAYBE THROUGH YEARS
OF CHILD ABUSE...

11:28.950 --> 11:31.089
OR SOME CATASTROPHIC EVENT.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.953
BECAUSE HE OVERCOMPENSATES
TO HIDE HIS INSECURITIES,

11:33.990 --> 11:36.413
WE BELIEVE HE MAY HOLD
A POSITION OF AUTHORITY
AT WORK.

11:36.460 --> 11:39.429
AND SINCE WE THINK
HE'S HAD MEDICAL
TRAINING,

11:39.460 --> 11:43.499
CONSIDER EMTS, DOCTORS,
VETERINARIANS.

11:43.530 --> 11:44.997
PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

11:45.030 --> 11:45.826
FOR THIS UNSUB,

11:45.870 --> 11:46.894
THE FRENCH QUARTER'S
A HUNTING GROUND.

11:46.940 --> 11:51.866
HE'S CERTAINLY ALREADY PROVEN
HE KNOWS THE TERRAIN.

12:09.060 --> 12:10.049
JEEZ!

12:10.090 --> 12:12.183
REID, YOU SCARED ME.

12:12.230 --> 12:13.959
ALWAYS BEEN ONE STEP
AHEAD OF YOU, MAN.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.798
YEAH, WHATEVER HELPS YOU
SLEEP AT NIGHT.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.162
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.098
YOU, TOO.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.233
LET'S GET A DRINK.

12:27.010 --> 12:27.829
PRENTISS.

12:27.880 --> 12:28.778
WHAT WAS THE THING

12:28.810 --> 12:30.949
JACK THE RIPPER TOOK
FROM ONE OF HIS VICTIMS?

12:30.980 --> 12:32.538
BESIDES, WELL,
YOU KNOW, HER LIFE?

12:32.580 --> 12:35.014
OH. UH--UH...

12:35.050 --> 12:35.914
MMM.

12:35.950 --> 12:37.986
TICK TOCK...

12:38.020 --> 12:39.282
TICK TOCK.

12:39.320 --> 12:42.118
I DON'T KNOW.

12:42.160 --> 12:42.888
A KIDNEY.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.557
HOW HORRIFYINGLY
FANTASTIC IS THAT?

12:44.590 --> 12:47.297
MM-HMM. AND ARE YOU
GOING ANYWHERE WITH THIS?

12:47.330 --> 12:51.289
JUST THAT I FOUND
AN UNSOLVED MURDER
THAT HAPPENED 4 MONTHS AGO

12:51.330 --> 12:52.934
IN GALVESTON, TEXAS,

12:52.970 --> 12:54.096
WITH THE SAME M.O.,

12:54.140 --> 12:55.289
THE VICTIM MISSING

12:55.340 --> 12:58.138
THAT VERY ORGAN.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.871
I AMAZE MYSELF.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.969
YEAH. ME, TOO.

13:03.010 --> 13:04.147
GREAT WORK.

13:04.180 --> 13:05.147
WHAT'S THAT?

13:05.180 --> 13:08.047
GARCIA FOUND A SIMILAR CASE
IN GALVESTON, TEXAS.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.184
A LOT OF KATRINA REFUGEES
RELOCATED THERE.

13:10.220 --> 13:11.187
IT COULD BE THE SAME GUY.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.814
HE REMOVED THE KIDNEY
JUST LIKE JACK THE RIPPER.

13:13.860 --> 13:14.815
CALL REID AND MORGAN.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.158
I WANT THE 3 OF YOU
ON A PLANE TO TEXAS TONIGHT.

13:17.190 --> 13:18.282
OK.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.567
SO...

13:28.600 --> 13:30.909
ARE YOU GONNA
ASK THE QUESTION?

13:30.940 --> 13:32.908
WHAT QUESTION?

13:32.940 --> 13:33.975
COME ON, MAN.

13:34.010 --> 13:34.874
IT'S ME HERE.

13:34.910 --> 13:37.071
WE HAVEN'T TALKED
TO EACH OTHER IN YEARS.

13:37.110 --> 13:38.372
I KNOW IT'S WHY
YOU CALLED ME.

13:38.410 --> 13:40.913
ASK THE QUESTION.

13:40.950 --> 13:44.909
WHY DID YOU QUIT
AFTER ONLY ONE DAY
OF FBI TRAINING?

13:46.090 --> 13:48.354
WELL...

13:48.390 --> 13:52.178
I'M SURE YOU'VE
CONSIDERED THE EVIDENCE,

13:52.230 --> 13:55.620
ANALYZED THE SIGNS.

13:55.660 --> 13:56.968
WHAT'S YOUR THEORY?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.194
YOU WERE BATTLING
YOUR OWN DEMONS.

13:58.230 --> 14:01.290
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO ANALYZE SOMEONE ELSE'S.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.398
NOT BAD. NOT BAD.

14:02.440 --> 14:06.604
THOSE DAYS, I DID PREFER
JACK DANIEL'S TO JEFF DAHMER.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.872
THEY BOTH WEIGH ON YOUR SOUL
EVENTUALLY.

14:17.450 --> 14:19.918
THE BAT PHONE.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.520
LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
ETHAN.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.983
DO YOU EVER REGRET IT?

14:26.190 --> 14:29.193
YOU KNOW, I MAY NOT
BE CHANGING THE WORLD, BUT...

14:29.230 --> 14:30.219
MY MUSIC MAKES ME HAPPY.

14:30.270 --> 14:34.491
IT DOESN'T TAKE A PROFILER
TO SEE THAT YOU'RE NOT.

14:37.370 --> 14:39.201
IT'S NOT EASY.
AND IT'S NOT--

14:39.240 --> 14:44.246
I...DON'T THINK YOU'D
BELIEVE SOME OF THE THINGS
THAT I'VE SEEN.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.013
JOHN COLTRANE.

14:47.050 --> 14:48.517
HE WAS A GENIUS, TOO.

14:48.550 --> 14:49.539
DIED OF CANCER.

14:49.580 --> 14:52.310
BUT MOST PEOPLE THINK
IT WAS THE BOOZE AND HEROIN

14:52.350 --> 14:53.248
THAT DID HIM IN.

14:53.290 --> 14:55.258
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

14:55.290 --> 14:57.485
YOU LOOK LIKE HELL.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.185
I'M FINE.

14:59.230 --> 14:59.992
COME ON, MAN.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.520
I'M A JAZZ MUSICIAN
IN NEW ORLEANS.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.267
I KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
WHEN SOMEONE'S NOT WELL.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.963
THIS MAY BE THE ONE TIME
I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING

15:08.000 --> 15:11.208
THAT YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.468
THAT MIGHT HELP YOU FORGET,

15:12.510 --> 15:14.603
BUT IT WON'T MAKE IT
GO AWAY.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.471
AND IF I CAN TELL...

15:16.510 --> 15:19.502
YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY
SOME OF THE BEST MINDS
IN THE WORLD,

15:19.550 --> 15:23.418
AND IF YOU THINK
THEY DON'T NOTICE...

15:23.450 --> 15:25.315
WELL...

15:25.350 --> 15:27.580
FOR A GENIUS,

15:27.620 --> 15:28.689
THAT'S JUST DUMB.

15:34.460 --> 15:37.190
HEY.
HEY.

15:39.770 --> 15:41.135
WHERE'S REID?

15:41.170 --> 15:43.331
I WAS HOPING
HE WAS WITH YOU.

15:43.370 --> 15:45.304
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU CALLED HIM.

15:45.340 --> 15:48.002
I DID, 4 TIMES.
NOTHING.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.272
THE VICTIM'S FIANCEE
IS EXPECTING US.

15:51.310 --> 15:54.211
WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

15:55.720 --> 15:58.018
WE GOT ONE OPTION.

15:58.050 --> 15:59.586
WHEELS UP.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.356
THANK YOU.

16:04.390 --> 16:05.823
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

16:05.860 --> 16:10.194
THE FRENCH QUARTER'S ONE OF
THE ONLY PARTS OF THE CITY
THAT DODGED KATRINA.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.061
NOW THERE'S
A SERIAL KILLER LOOSE.

16:12.100 --> 16:12.896
IT'S A SMALL AREA,

16:12.930 --> 16:15.330
AND WE'RE NARROWING
DOWN THE PROFILE.

16:15.370 --> 16:17.600
WE'LL FIND HIM.

16:18.440 --> 16:22.274
YOU ALWAYS DRINK
WHILE YOU'RE STILL
ON THE CLOCK?

16:22.310 --> 16:24.141
THIS IS NEW ORLEANS,
HONEY.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.670
IT'S A CULTURAL THING.

16:25.710 --> 16:28.611
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

16:28.650 --> 16:30.049
PENNSYLVANIA.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.341
I TAKE IT THE FOLKS

16:31.390 --> 16:36.054
ARE A LITTLE RIGID
ABOUT THE RULES UP THAT WAY.

16:36.390 --> 16:39.086
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER...

16:39.130 --> 16:41.325
* JUST TAKE ME BACK...

16:41.360 --> 16:44.397
WE'LL PLAY IT
PENNSYLVANIA STYLE TONIGHT.

16:44.430 --> 16:47.695
I JUST HATE THAT THIS GUY
HAS A LEG UP ON US, YOU KNOW?

16:47.740 --> 16:53.303
I PROMISE, AS SOON AS
MY TEAM KNOWS ANYTHING,
WE'LL HEAR.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.102
OK?

16:56.540 --> 16:57.746
WHY AREN'T YOU MARRIED?

17:01.380 --> 17:05.339
UH, THAT INVOLVES
THIS CASE HOW?

17:05.390 --> 17:06.743
IT DOESN'T.

17:06.790 --> 17:09.008
I'M JUST FLIRTIN'.

17:09.620 --> 17:11.053
IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL.

17:11.090 --> 17:13.524
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ANSWER THAT.

17:13.560 --> 17:14.390
EXCUSE ME.

17:14.430 --> 17:19.129
COMPLIMENTS OF THE WOMAN
IN THE BLUE TOP.

17:21.770 --> 17:24.432
WOW. THAT WAS...BOLD.

17:24.470 --> 17:28.304
SHE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT
WE WERE JUST WORKING.

17:29.310 --> 17:30.447
WE ARE.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.744
ARE YOU JEALOUS?

17:34.680 --> 17:36.739
NO. I JUST--I...

17:36.780 --> 17:38.384
I'M SURPRISED,
THAT'S ALL.

17:38.420 --> 17:41.651
AND YOU'RE A LOUSY LIAR, TOO.

17:41.690 --> 17:44.250
YOU HAVEN'T HAD
MUCH PRACTICE, HUH?

17:44.290 --> 17:47.259
IT'S A CULTURE THING.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.392
YOU SEE.

17:49.430 --> 17:50.692
THERE YOU GO.

17:50.730 --> 17:51.662
EVERYBODY KEPT SAYING

17:51.700 --> 17:55.693
CRIME'S GONNA SKYROCKET
AFTER THE RELOCATION.

17:55.740 --> 17:59.369
YOU JUST NEVER THINK
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU.

17:59.410 --> 18:01.731
THE REPORT SAID
THAT YOUR FIANCE

18:01.780 --> 18:04.476
WAS BAR-HOPPING
FOR HIS BACHELOR PARTY

18:04.510 --> 18:07.377
ON THE NIGHT
HE WAS KILLED.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.617
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
MARRIED IN OCTOBER.

18:10.650 --> 18:13.483
HE WAS JUST OUT
CELEBRATING THAT WITH FRIENDS.

18:13.520 --> 18:16.318
WAS THERE ANYONE AT
LEONARD'S BACHELOR PARTY

18:16.360 --> 18:17.850
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

18:17.890 --> 18:19.881
WE ALL GREW UP TOGETHER.

18:19.930 --> 18:21.488
THEY'RE LIKE FAMILY
TO ME.

18:21.530 --> 18:24.169
WHETHER THEY MET
SOMEBODY OUT, YOU KNOW,

18:24.200 --> 18:25.462
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.765
THEY'RE A ROWDY BUNCH.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.531
AND THEY'D PARTY
WITH ANYBODY.

18:33.740 --> 18:37.278
EACH OF THE LAST 2 VICTIMS
WAS TRAVELING IN A GROUP.

18:37.310 --> 18:40.438
BOTH WERE DRINKING,
BOTH IN PUBLIC ARENAS,
BAR-HOPPING.

18:40.480 --> 18:44.246
SO HOW COULD THEIR FRIENDS
NOT SEE ANYTHING?

18:44.550 --> 18:47.758
IT LIKE WHEN A LION
PREYS UPON AN ANTELOPE.

18:47.790 --> 18:50.520
YOU LOST ME.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.528
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU, EMILY PRENTISS,

18:52.560 --> 18:54.425
HAVE NEVER BEEN
ONE OF THE ANTELOPE.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.395
OH, SCRATCH THAT.
YOU TOTALLY LOST ME.

18:57.430 --> 18:58.727
OK. CHECK THIS OUT.

18:58.770 --> 19:01.432
THE ANTELOPE
TRAVEL IN PACKS.

19:01.470 --> 19:04.598
SO THE LION
JUST SITS AND WAITS.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.631
WAITS FOR JUST ONE
OF THE ANTELOPE

19:06.670 --> 19:09.309
TO BREAK AWAY
FROM ITS HERD.

19:09.340 --> 19:10.170
SO WHEN HE'S ALONE,

19:10.210 --> 19:12.747
VULNERABLE, AND
COMPLETELY UNPROTECT ED,

19:12.780 --> 19:14.372
THAT'S WHEN
THE LION STRIKES.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.217
THAT'S WHEN
SHE MAKES HER MOVE.

19:16.250 --> 19:18.218
WAIT A MINUTE.
HER MOVE?

19:18.250 --> 19:19.512
PRENTISS,
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING

19:19.550 --> 19:20.778
THAT'S GONNA MAKE
A STRAIGHT MAN

19:20.820 --> 19:22.515
LEAVE HIS FRIENDS
ON GUYS NIGHT OUT.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.654
AND IT'LL MAKE HIM LEAVE
EVERY TIME.

19:26.530 --> 19:30.193
ONE OF THE VICTIMS
WAS OUT FOR HIS
BACHELOR PARTY.

19:31.030 --> 19:32.861
ANOTHER ONE OUT
WITH JUST THE GUYS.

19:32.900 --> 19:33.889
WHAT'S THE ONLY
TEMPTATION

19:33.940 --> 19:37.262
THAT'S GONNA LURE
THESE MEN AWAY
FROM EACH OTHER?

19:37.740 --> 19:38.866
J.J.

19:38.910 --> 19:41.708
* AND SHE ROCKS...

19:41.740 --> 19:42.775
OK.

19:42.810 --> 19:45.506
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT HERE
WITH ME.

19:46.850 --> 19:47.669
THAN KS.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.574
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:49.620 --> 19:53.249
THE UNSUB WE'RE
LOOKING FOR IS A WOMAN.

20:04.630 --> 20:05.619
HEY.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.297
SO I ALERTED THE DEPARTMENT
AND UPDATED THE BOLO.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.467
GOOD. WE NEED TO SET UP
A PRESS CONFERENCE.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.639
WE'RE NOT MAKING
A MEDIA SPECTACLE
OUT OF THIS.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.707
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW
THAT THIS KILLER
IS A WOMAN.

20:14.740 --> 20:15.638
WHAT?

20:15.680 --> 20:16.601
LISTEN.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.279
TOURISTS ARE JUST STARTING
TO FILTER BACK HERE.

20:19.310 --> 20:20.811
THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE.

20:20.850 --> 20:23.318
I CAN'T CREATE MASS HYSTERIA
IN A CITY TRYING TO REBUILD.

20:23.350 --> 20:26.547
BESIDES, WE'LL BE PLAYING
RIGHT INTO HER HANDS.

20:26.590 --> 20:28.251
SO BE IT.

20:28.820 --> 20:29.684
LOOK, UM...

20:29.720 --> 20:32.689
I'M TRYING NOT TO GO
ABOVE YOUR HEAD HERE.

20:32.730 --> 20:35.449
YEAH.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.961
I GOT THAT.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.333
THEN SET UP
THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.636
HEY, YOU GUYS ARE BACK
FROM GALVESTON?

20:44.670 --> 20:46.262
FIRST LIGHT THIS MORNING.
WHERE WERE YOU?

20:46.310 --> 20:49.006
I WAS OUT WITH A FRIEND.
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

20:49.040 --> 20:49.870
I CALLED YOU
4 TIMES.

20:49.910 --> 20:51.707
I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY CELL PHONE RECEPTION,

20:51.750 --> 20:54.275
SO I DIDN'T GET
YOUR MESSAGE UNTIL LATE.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.776
RIGHT.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.788
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:57.820 --> 21:01.586
OUR UNSUB'S A WOMAN.

21:01.620 --> 21:04.987
WE JUST FOUND ANOTHER BODY
IN THE QUARTER.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.959
TH ROAT'S BEEN CUT.

21:06.990 --> 21:10.562
HE'S BEEN DISEMBOWELED, TOO.

21:11.330 --> 21:13.332
REEKS OF BOOZE.

21:13.370 --> 21:14.769
IT'S MORE
THAN A PATTERN.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.597
ONLY THIS TIME HE
CUT OFF THE EARLOBE.

21:16.640 --> 21:19.632
SHE'S STICKING WITH
THE RIPPER'S PARADIGM.

21:19.670 --> 21:20.602
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:20.640 --> 21:21.902
IN ONE LETTER
OF CORRESPONDENCE,

21:21.940 --> 21:24.579
JACK THE RIPPER PROMISED
TO CUT THE EARLOBE OFF

21:24.610 --> 21:25.770
OF HIS NEXT VICTIM.

21:25.810 --> 21:26.640
HE DID.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.443
IT WAS THE ONE DAY
THAT HE KILLED TWICE.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.313
SO SHE'S GONNA KILL AGAIN
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

21:31.350 --> 21:34.057
OK, WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT FEMALE SERIAL KILLERS?

21:34.090 --> 21:36.558
BASICALLY,
YOU HAVE 2 TYPES.

21:36.590 --> 21:38.319
THE SANTE KIMES MODEL.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.384
COLD, CALCULATING.

21:39.430 --> 21:40.226
PREYS ON MEN FOR MONEY.

21:40.260 --> 21:41.796
TAKES HER TIME
BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS.

21:41.830 --> 21:43.422
IT'S MORE LIKELY
WE'RE DEALING WITH

21:43.470 --> 21:44.619
THE AILEEN WUORNOS
ARCHETYPE,

21:44.670 --> 21:46.558
MOTIVATED BY PARANOIA
AND FEAR,

21:46.600 --> 21:47.498
LURING MEN WITH SEX.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.462
OUR UNSUB'S ORGANIZED.
SHE FOLLOWS A ROUTINE.

21:49.500 --> 21:53.334
SHE MEETS MEN IN A BAR,
FLIRTS WITH THEM OVER DRINKS,

21:53.380 --> 21:57.009
AND SUGGESTS THAT
THEY CONSUMMATE THE EVENING
IN AN ALLEY.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.042
WE NEED TO BE
IN THOSE STREETS.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.709
OFFICE JUST
BROUGHT ME THIS.

22:03.120 --> 22:03.939
"DEAR BOSS,

22:03.990 --> 22:07.778
"BY NOW I HAVE RID
THE WORLD OF ONE MORE.

22:07.820 --> 22:10.459
"SO MANY MEN,
SO LITTLE TIME.

22:10.490 --> 22:11.821
"I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
THE MESS.

22:11.860 --> 22:13.350
"THEY MAKE IS SO EASY,

22:13.400 --> 22:15.789
"I JUST CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

22:15.830 --> 22:17.024
YOURS TRULY."

22:23.000 --> 22:26.538
SO WERE LOOKING FOR A WOMAN
WHO WILL APPROACH MEN,

22:26.570 --> 22:28.435
COMFORTABLE BEING
THE AGGRESSOR, NO?

22:28.480 --> 22:32.007
AND I'M GUESSING
SHE'D HAVE TO BE
QUITE ATTRACTIVE

22:32.050 --> 22:34.848
IN ORDER TO LURE THEM AWAY.

22:37.720 --> 22:38.709
MOST OF THE WOMEN
ARE OUT IN GROUPS,

22:38.750 --> 22:41.913
SO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN
FOR SOMEONE
ON THEIR OWN.

22:44.860 --> 22:48.159
"SO MANY MEN,
SO LITTLE TIME."

22:48.200 --> 22:49.952
SO SHE'S ON A QUEST...

22:50.000 --> 22:52.389
TO WIPE OUT THE RACE.

22:52.430 --> 22:55.092
OR...THE FATHER
WHO MOLESTED HER?

22:55.140 --> 22:57.836
SOME PEOPLE THINK
JACK THE RIPPER
MUTILATED WOMEN

22:57.870 --> 23:01.601
AFTER HIS MOTHER
SEXUALLY ABUSED HIM
FOR YEARS.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.404
FOR SOMEONE SO ENRAGED...

23:04.450 --> 23:06.839
THIS UNSUB SOUNDS
ODDLY APOLOGETIC

23:06.880 --> 23:10.611
FOR LEAVING
A BLOODY CRIME SCENE.

23:10.650 --> 23:11.480
WHY?

23:11.520 --> 23:15.513
THAT MIGHT BE WHAT
LAMONTAGNE FIGURED OUT

23:15.560 --> 23:16.618
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

23:16.660 --> 23:19.788
YOU GOTTA ADMIT,
THESE GUYS ARE
MAKING IT PRETTY EASY.

23:19.830 --> 23:22.025
I WOULDN'T FOLLOW
A STRANGER INTO AN ALLEY

23:22.060 --> 23:23.596
NO MATTER HOW WASTED
I WAS.

23:23.630 --> 23:24.528
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE NOT A MAN.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.198
TESTOSTERONE WILL FOLLOW
A WOMAN TO THAILAND.

23:27.230 --> 23:28.037
BAREFOOT.

23:28.070 --> 23:30.664
IT'S JUST A FACT.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.206
DID YOU GIVE THAT
NEWEST LETTER TO REID?

23:37.240 --> 23:40.812
HE KNOWS THAT RIPPER CASE
INSIDE OUT.

23:40.850 --> 23:42.909
HE MIGHT SEE SOMETHING
I'M MISSING.

23:42.950 --> 23:44.747
I DON'T THINK, UH...

23:44.790 --> 23:46.087
WHAT IS IT?

23:46.120 --> 23:47.678
NOTHING.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.789
COME ON.

23:48.820 --> 23:53.120
YOU THINK I'M NOT AWARE
SOMETHING'S GOING ON WITH HIM?

23:56.830 --> 24:00.789
YOU GONNA TELL ME WHY
YOU MISSED THAT FLIGHT
TO GALVESTON?

24:00.840 --> 24:01.761
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.030
IT WAS NO CELL RECEPTION.

24:04.070 --> 24:06.504
RIGHT.

24:06.540 --> 24:07.302
WHAT?

24:07.340 --> 24:08.272
I MEAN, ANYTIME
YOU WANT TO COME UP

24:08.310 --> 24:11.973
WITH A BETTER ANSWER,
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

24:13.850 --> 24:15.772
DARK CURLS, 3 O'CLOCK.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.685
I GOT IT.

24:20.620 --> 24:23.987
SHE'S EYEING THOSE GUYS
OUTSIDE THAT BAR.

24:27.930 --> 24:29.727
LET'S GO.

24:35.100 --> 24:36.988
OH! OH, I'M--I'M SORRY.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.031
I HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

24:39.070 --> 24:39.764
YOU ALL RIGHT?

24:39.810 --> 24:42.973
WHAT CAN I DO
TO SAY I'M SORRY?

24:43.010 --> 24:45.547
HOW ABOUT A DRINK?

24:45.580 --> 24:48.174
HAVE A DRINK.
THAT'S COOL.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.949
THAT'S COOL.

24:50.690 --> 24:51.281
SURE.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.550
YEAH,
THAT'S TOTALLY FINE.

24:53.590 --> 24:54.852
YEAH.

24:56.920 --> 24:57.955
YEAH.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.821
DAN NY.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.020
YOU FOOL.

25:01.060 --> 25:03.893
YOU DROPPED YOUR WALLET
OUT THERE.

25:03.930 --> 25:04.692
THAN KS.

25:04.730 --> 25:07.028
NEXT DRINK IS ON ME.

25:11.140 --> 25:12.232
SO...

25:12.270 --> 25:14.977
WHERE ARE YOUR FRIENDS
TONIGHT?

25:15.280 --> 25:17.669
I DIDN'T BRING ANY.

25:17.710 --> 25:20.099
THEY GET IN THE WAY.

25:20.150 --> 25:21.845
NOW, SEE, I LIKE THAT.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.212
'CAUSE, UH, MOST GIRLS,

25:24.250 --> 25:28.186
THEY WON'T GO NOWHERE
ALONE.

25:30.320 --> 25:34.051
I'M NOT MOST GIRLS.

25:44.740 --> 25:46.002
WE GOT NOTHIN'.

25:46.040 --> 25:46.938
WELL, THE DAY'S
ALMOST OVER,

25:46.970 --> 25:49.973
SO IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
WE JUST RAN OUT OF TIME.

25:57.220 --> 26:00.041
YOUR HAIR'S WET.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.631
SHE'S MOCKING US.

26:18.670 --> 26:22.128
AND SHE'S TRUE TO HER WORD.

26:23.180 --> 26:25.341
DO YOU HAVE ANY TWEEZERS?

26:25.380 --> 26:27.848
THANK YOU.

26:29.780 --> 26:30.849
WHAT IS THAT?

26:30.890 --> 26:32.846
I HAVE NO IDEA.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.255
IT'S A NOTE FROM THE UNSUB,

26:38.290 --> 26:39.757
ADDRESSED TO YOUR FATHER.

26:39.790 --> 26:41.690
LET'S SEE IT.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.288
"DEAR BOSS,

26:43.330 --> 26:44.160
"HE WANTED IT,

26:44.200 --> 26:46.088
"WITH THAT SHARP TONGUE
AND VULGAR HAND.

26:46.130 --> 26:48.132
"THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW

26:48.170 --> 26:50.661
"ANOTHER WILL SOON GET
WHAT HE DESERVES.

26:50.710 --> 26:51.859
YOURS TRULY."

26:51.910 --> 26:55.129
IT'S WEIRD. TYPICALLY,
OFFENDERS WRITE LETTERS
TO BE HEARD.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.136
JACK THE RIPPER BRAGGED
ABOUT NOT BEING CAUGHT.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.000
THIS UNSUB ISN'T USING
CORRESPONDENCE

26:59.050 --> 27:00.711
TO FLAUNT HER LATEST KILL,

27:00.750 --> 27:01.739
ONLY TO EXPLAIN
WHY SHE DID IT.

27:01.780 --> 27:05.079
IT'S POSSIBLE
SHE CONSIDERS HERSELF
A VIGILANTE.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.248
THAT THE MEN SHE'S KILLING
DESERVE TO DIE.

27:08.290 --> 27:10.349
OR MAYBE SHE'S CONTACTING
YOUR FATHER,

27:10.390 --> 27:12.722
NOT BECAUSE HE WAS
THE LEAD DETECTIVE

27:12.760 --> 27:14.421
ON THE CASE, BUT...

27:14.460 --> 27:17.020
BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES
HE'D UNDERSTAND.

27:17.060 --> 27:18.664
YOU THINK
HE KNEW HER SOMEHOW?

27:18.700 --> 27:20.839
CAN YOU THINK OF A WOMAN
IN YOUR DAD'S LIFE

27:20.870 --> 27:23.759
HE HELPED THROUGH
A TOUGH TIME?

27:23.810 --> 27:24.902
MIGHT BE ANOTHER
POLICE OFFICER,

27:24.940 --> 27:27.875
I DON'T KNOW, A PROSTITUTE
HE HELPED GET OFF THE STREET?

27:27.910 --> 27:29.832
HE HASN'T DEALT
WITH PROSTITUTES

27:29.880 --> 27:31.302
SINCE HE WORKED
SEX CRIMES.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.410
THE UNSUB WROTE,
"HE WAS ASKING TO BE RIPPED."

27:34.450 --> 27:37.146
"I JUST COULDN'T HELP MYSELF,"
AND HE WANTED IT."

27:37.180 --> 27:41.082
WHAT IF SHE'S MIRRORING
THE MAN WHO RAPED HER?

27:41.120 --> 27:43.884
WHERE ARE THE FILES STORED
FROM YOUR SEX CRIME
DIVISION?

27:43.930 --> 27:45.989
THEY WERE HOUSED
THE SAME PLACE
AS HOMICIDE.

27:46.030 --> 27:47.895
MOST OF THEM
WERE WASHED AWAY.

27:47.930 --> 27:50.251
DID YOUR DAD
HAVE A PARTNER?

27:50.300 --> 27:51.392
YEAH. J.R. SMITH.

27:51.430 --> 27:52.465
SMITTY, THEY CALLED HIM.

27:52.500 --> 27:53.899
HE MIGHT REMEMBER
SOMETHING.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.989
YEAH, BUT THEY HAD
A FALLING OUT.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.200
WHAT ABOUT?

27:58.240 --> 28:00.800
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY STOPPED TALKING
WHEN HE LEFT SEX CRIMES.

28:00.840 --> 28:01.875
THAT WAS 9 YEARS AGO.

28:01.910 --> 28:04.743
THE GUY DIDN'T EVEN COME
TO MY DADDY'S FUNERAL, SO...

28:04.780 --> 28:06.941
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
CALLING HIM?

28:06.980 --> 28:09.847
NOT IF IT MEANS
BREAKING THIS CASE.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.957
MAY I BORROW YOUR HAND
FOR A MINUTE?

28:22.800 --> 28:24.995
I'LL BE DAMNED.

28:25.030 --> 28:26.019
WHAT IS IT?

28:26.070 --> 28:27.196
THE STAMP
ON THE VICTIM'S HAND--

28:27.230 --> 28:28.788
IT'S ADMITTANCE
INTO THE MON CHERIE.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.728
IT'S A BAR
IN THE FRENCH QUARTER.

28:30.770 --> 28:31.964
OH, YEAH?

28:32.010 --> 28:32.704
YEAH.

28:32.740 --> 28:36.005
9 YEARS AGO
IT WAS CALLED JONES.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.040
BINGO.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.844
GET GARCIA ON THE HORN.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.218
O CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN.

28:46.250 --> 28:46.784
I NEED YOU.

28:46.820 --> 28:48.219
ANYTHING.
TALK TO ME.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.454
IS THERE ANY
NEWSPAPER REPORTS

28:49.490 --> 28:53.051
ABOUT A RAPE
AT A BAR CALLED JONES?

28:55.200 --> 28:56.121
ZILCH.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.525
YOU SURE?
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

28:57.560 --> 28:58.993
ABOUT 9 YEARS AGO.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.292
NADA.

29:00.330 --> 29:02.161
OK. UH...

29:02.200 --> 29:04.236
CROSS-REFERENCE
WILLIAM LAMONTAGNE

29:04.270 --> 29:06.204
WITH JONES BAR.

29:07.940 --> 29:08.736
BU LL'S-EYE.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.907
POLICE BLOTTER--
ANSWERED A DISTURBANCE

29:10.950 --> 29:12.474
AT JONES BAR
IN THE FRENCH QUARTER,

29:12.510 --> 29:14.842
FEBRUARY 19, 1998.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.019
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS DURING
MARDI GRAS.

29:17.050 --> 29:18.779
YOU ARE THE BEST EVER.

29:18.820 --> 29:21.880
OHH...AND YOU'RE THE MOST
PERCEPTIVE.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.952
SMITTY.

29:26.990 --> 29:28.355
HOW ARE YOU?

29:28.400 --> 29:31.267
I HOPE YOU GOT
A GOOD REASON

29:31.300 --> 29:32.392
DREDGING THIS CRAP UP.

29:34.540 --> 29:35.529
WELL, I WAS HOPING

29:35.570 --> 29:37.390
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER
BEING CALLED HERE

29:37.440 --> 29:39.169
WITH MY DADDY 9 YEARS AGO.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.007
IS THAT A JOKE?

29:41.040 --> 29:41.574
NO.

29:41.610 --> 29:42.975
MY NAME'S JASON GIDEON.

29:43.010 --> 29:43.874
WE'RE FROM THE FBI.

29:43.910 --> 29:46.105
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THE SERIES OF MURDERS

29:46.150 --> 29:46.809
IN THE FRENCH QUARTER.

29:46.850 --> 29:48.477
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO
WITH ME?

29:48.520 --> 29:49.646
WE NEED YOU TO TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED

29:49.680 --> 29:52.444
THE NIGHT YOU
AND DETECTIVE LAMONTAGNE
ANSWERED THE CALL

29:52.490 --> 29:54.549
IN THIS BAR.

29:55.190 --> 29:57.112
AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

29:57.160 --> 30:00.186
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW, DO YOU?

30:00.230 --> 30:01.891
AFTER THAT NIGHT,
YOUR DADDY

30:01.930 --> 30:04.091
TRIED TO BRING ME UP
ON SANCTIONS.

30:04.130 --> 30:04.960
WHY?

30:05.000 --> 30:05.967
IT WAS MARDI GRAS.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.524
SOME GIRL CLAIMED
SHE WAS RAPED.

30:07.570 --> 30:08.389
IN THIS BAR.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.839
I WASN'T BUYING IT.

30:09.870 --> 30:11.929
WHAT DID SHE SAY
HAPPENED TO HER?

30:11.970 --> 30:13.437
BRASS BACKED ME UP.

30:13.470 --> 30:15.938
THEY ENDED UP
TRANSFERRING YOUR DADDY OUT

30:15.980 --> 30:17.333
TO SHUT HIM UP.

30:17.380 --> 30:19.245
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

30:19.280 --> 30:21.840
IT ALMOST COST ME MY CAREER.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.212
DO YOU MIND TELLING US
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:24.550 --> 30:25.289
MY BEST RECOLLECT ION,

30:25.320 --> 30:27.914
SHE SAID SHE WAS SITTING
AT THE BAR

30:27.960 --> 30:29.086
WITH 2 FRIENDS.

30:29.120 --> 30:34.490
ONE OF THE BOYS ASKED HER
IF SHE WANTED TO PLAY SOME POOL.

30:34.530 --> 30:37.556
WITNESSES CLAIM
SHE WAS UP FOR ANYTHING.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.261
* SOME FUNKY MUSIC

30:39.300 --> 30:43.066
* THAT THEY CALL...

30:43.100 --> 30:45.967
SHE FOLLOWED HIM
UP HERE?

30:46.010 --> 30:49.275
HIS FRIEND NOT FAR BEHIND.

30:49.310 --> 30:52.143
SHE KNEW HE WAS THERE.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.182
THAT GIRL WAS A TEASE.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.982
SHE WAS LOOKING FOR
A GOOD TIME.

31:06.030 --> 31:10.967
ANYWAY, A COUPLE OF GUYS
WERE GOING ALONG WITH THAT.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.097
DID SHE YELL FOR HELP?

31:13.130 --> 31:14.392
SHE SAID SHE DID.

31:14.440 --> 31:18.103
BUT NOT A SINGLE PERSON
CLAIMED THAT THEY HEARD HER.

31:23.240 --> 31:26.539
THAT'S WHAT YOU REGISTERED
AS A DISTURBANCE?

31:26.580 --> 31:29.447
IT WAS MARDI GRAS.

31:29.480 --> 31:30.447
LISTEN TO ME.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.584
THAT GIRL HAD ENOUGH BEADS
HANGING FROM HER NECK

31:32.620 --> 31:33.541
TO JEWEL A SMALL CITY.

31:33.590 --> 31:38.129
ANYONE EXPOSES THEMSELVES
THAT MUCH IN ONE DAY

31:38.160 --> 31:39.980
IS NOT A CREDIBLE WITNESS
IN MY BOOK.

31:40.030 --> 31:41.224
BUT SHE WANTED
TO PRESS CHARGES.

31:41.260 --> 31:43.023
I TOLD HER
IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME.

31:43.060 --> 31:45.028
I KNEW
ONE OF THE ACCUSED.

31:45.070 --> 31:45.968
HE WAS A GOOD KID.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.468
HE DIDN'T NEED THE STINK
OF THAT ACCUSATION.

31:48.500 --> 31:51.628
SO YOU PROTECTED A RAPIST?

31:53.070 --> 31:54.037
WELL, THAT RIGHT THERE

31:54.080 --> 31:56.708
WAS A BONE OF CONTENTION
BETWEEN HIS DADDY AND I.

31:56.740 --> 31:58.071
AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED,

31:58.110 --> 31:59.941
NO SUCH RAPE
EVER TOOK PLACE.

31:59.980 --> 32:01.072
ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME

32:01.120 --> 32:05.113
WHY YOU WENT AND DRAGGED
THIS DIRT BACK THROUGH MY LIFE?

32:06.690 --> 32:07.543
YOU KNOW THE SERIAL KILLER

32:07.590 --> 32:11.151
WHO'S CUTTING UP MEN
IN THE FRENCH QUARTER?

32:11.190 --> 32:13.283
SHE WAS YOUR VICTIM.

32:15.360 --> 32:18.466
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND
A NAME.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.462
IT WAS 9 YEARS AGO.

32:22.500 --> 32:26.368
WHAT ABOUT THE NAME
OF THE "GOOD KID"
WHO RAPED HER?

32:28.680 --> 32:29.908
SMITTY...

32:29.940 --> 32:33.148
YOU TELL ME RIGHT NOW
OR I'LL FILE
A NEW SANCT ION AGAINST YOU,

32:33.180 --> 32:37.241
AND I GUARANTEE YOU,
THIS TIME IT'LL STICK.

32:40.590 --> 32:43.309
MR. TIBIDEAUX,
WE NEED YOU TO ANSWER
A FEW QUESTIONS

32:43.360 --> 32:46.523
ABOUT A DISTURBANCE
YOU WERE INVOLVED
WITH IN 1998.

32:46.560 --> 32:50.257
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.598
AT A BAR CALLED JONES.

32:53.330 --> 32:55.332
IT WAS MARDI GRAS.

32:55.800 --> 32:59.099
WELL, THEN, I MUST HAVE BEEN
DRINKING SOME,

32:59.140 --> 33:00.698
'CAUSE I DON'T
REMEMBER A THING.

33:00.740 --> 33:02.332
WE JUST NEED
TO KNOW THE NAME
OF YOUR ACCUSER.

33:02.380 --> 33:05.679
LOOK, I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

33:05.710 --> 33:08.247
THE STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS IS UP.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.611
WE JUST NEED A NAME.

33:09.650 --> 33:13.643
SOMEONE ACCUSES ME
OF RAPE,

33:13.690 --> 33:16.079
I'M GOING TO REMEMBER
HER NAME.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.553
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU,
CHER?

33:17.590 --> 33:20.252
I GUESS SHE DIDN'T MAKE
THAT GOOD OF AN IMPRESSION.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.599
UNLIKE YOURSELF,
RIGHT NOW.

33:22.630 --> 33:24.166
YOU KNOW, I'M GUESSING
IF SOMEONE

33:24.200 --> 33:27.499
DID DO SOMETHING
TO THAT GIRL THAT NIGHT,

33:27.530 --> 33:31.205
THEN SHE WAS PROBABLY
ASKING FOR IT.

33:31.240 --> 33:33.265
MAYBE EVEN LIKED IT.

33:33.310 --> 33:37.633
GUY'S NOT GIVING UP
ANYTHING.

33:37.680 --> 33:38.704
RIGHT AFTER
THE DOUBLE MURDER,

33:38.750 --> 33:40.149
WHAT WAS THE RIPPER'S
NEXT MOVE?

33:40.180 --> 33:41.738
HE MUTILATED
AND DISMEMBERED
MARY KELLY

33:41.780 --> 33:44.283
IN HER ONE-ROOM FLAT
UNTIL SHE WAS
UNRECOGNIZABLE.

33:44.320 --> 33:46.788
IT'S BELIEVED TO BE
HIS MOST VICIOUS
KILL OF ALL.

33:46.820 --> 33:47.844
'CAUSE HE HAD PRIVACY.

33:47.890 --> 33:51.348
AND TIME
TO TORTURE HIS VICTIM
BEFORE KILLING HER.

33:51.390 --> 33:54.052
MAYBE WE'RE NOT
TOO LATE.

33:59.600 --> 34:03.195
SHE MURDERED THESE MEN,

34:03.240 --> 34:06.607
AND I'M GUESSING
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

34:06.640 --> 34:08.676
BEFORE SHE WORKS HER WAY
BACK TO THE ONE

34:08.710 --> 34:11.747
SHE REALLY WANTS TO KILL.

34:11.780 --> 34:14.214
SHE MAKE
AN IMPRESSION NOW?

34:16.280 --> 34:17.269
WORK ME.

34:17.320 --> 34:21.416
WE HAVE A NAME--
SARAH DANLIN.
I NEED AN ADDRESS.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.224
1141 SHERMAN AVENUE.

34:24.260 --> 34:27.354
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS
A MED STUDENT AT TULANE,

34:27.390 --> 34:28.493
BUT SHE DROPPED OUT.

34:28.530 --> 34:31.658
LET ME GUESS--
FEBRUARY 1998.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.097
YEAH.
THAN KS.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.335
WE GOT HER.

34:41.810 --> 34:43.505
I'M JOHN,
BY THE WAY.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.770
JOHN.

34:46.350 --> 34:49.376
TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.843
YES, MA'AM.

35:18.680 --> 35:22.878
SARAH DANLIN, FBI!
OPEN THE DOOR.

35:30.790 --> 35:33.827
THE THINGS I'M GONNA
DO TO YOU.

35:36.930 --> 35:38.864
ME FIRST.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.768
FBI!

35:47.270 --> 35:49.329
CLEAR.
CLEAR.

35:49.980 --> 35:50.730
SHE'S NOT HERE.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.748
GUYS, THERE ARE
SOME RIPPEROLOGISTS

35:52.780 --> 35:54.441
WHO SPECULATE
THAT MARY KELLY

35:54.480 --> 35:55.344
WAS ACTUALLY KILLED
IN A FLAT

35:55.380 --> 35:56.813
THAT JACK THE RIPPER
RENTED FOR THE NIGHT.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.818
I'M GOING TO HAVE GARCIA
CHECK SARAH DANLIN'S

35:58.850 --> 36:00.442
CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS.
IT'S A LONG SHOT,

36:00.490 --> 36:03.812
BUT MAYBE WE CAN TRACE HER ROOM
BACK TO HER CHARGE CARDS.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.426
AAH!

36:12.470 --> 36:14.290
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

36:14.340 --> 36:15.432
SHH.

36:15.470 --> 36:16.562
YOU'RE CRAZY.

36:16.600 --> 36:22.607
YOU NEVER DID EXPLAIN THOSE
"THINGS" YOU COULD DO TO ME.

36:24.680 --> 36:25.544
SOUVENIRS.

36:25.580 --> 36:27.673
THESE ARE FROM BARS
IN THE FRENCH QUARTER.

36:27.710 --> 36:29.439
THIS IS FROM MON CHERIE.

36:29.480 --> 36:32.938
SHE'S TROLLING FOR VICTIMS
IN THE PLACE WHERE IT ALL BEGAN.

36:32.990 --> 36:33.888
SHE CAN'T MOVE ON.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.478
THE RAPE
ISN'T THE WHOLE STORY.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.953
I'LL BET THERE'S A HISTORY
OF SEXUAL ABUSE

36:38.890 --> 36:40.448
IT'S ALMOST LIKE BY TAKING
ON THE RIPPER PERSONA,

36:40.490 --> 36:43.789
SHE WAS TRYING TO KILL
SOMETHING WITHIN HERSELF.

36:44.870 --> 36:45.962
YEAH, MAMA, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.490
SARAH DANLIN'S VISA
WAS CHARGED

36:47.530 --> 36:48.929
AN HOUR AGO
AT THE ROYAL RUBY INN.

36:48.970 --> 36:51.564
AH, BABY GIRL,
YOU NEVER DISAPPOINT.
THANK YOU.

36:51.610 --> 36:52.702
ROYAL RUBY INN.

36:52.740 --> 36:56.699
THAT'S 2 BLOCKS FROM HERE.

37:00.880 --> 37:03.019
PLEASE!

37:03.050 --> 37:04.745
PLEASE. PLEASE.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.940
I HAVE--I HAVE CHILDREN.

37:06.990 --> 37:08.810
PLEASE.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.816
YOU ASKED...

37:10.860 --> 37:12.327
FBI!

37:12.360 --> 37:13.554
DROP THE KNIFE.

37:13.590 --> 37:14.488
DROP THE WEAPON.

37:14.530 --> 37:17.897
HE WANTED IT...
AND HE GOT IT.

37:17.930 --> 37:18.624
PUT IT DOWN NOW.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.867
WE NEED AN EMT TECH
RIGHT AWAY.

37:22.870 --> 37:23.894
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

37:23.940 --> 37:25.965
MA'AM, WE DON'T WANT
TO SHOOT YOU.

37:26.010 --> 37:30.834
BE SUCH A SHAME
TO WASTE THIS.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.000
WHAT I WANT IS FOR YOU
TO PUT THAT KNIFE DOWN.

37:34.050 --> 37:35.847
COME ON.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.643
DON'T FIGHT IT.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.979
SARAH, WE DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOU.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.156
MEN.

37:45.190 --> 37:50.025
SARAH, MY NAME'S
WILLIAM LAMONTAGNE JR.

37:50.930 --> 37:54.263
YOU KNEW MY DADDY?

37:56.040 --> 37:57.996
YEAH, YEAH.

37:58.040 --> 38:02.500
YOU TRUSTED HIM.
SO TRUST ME.

38:03.980 --> 38:05.572
WHERE IS HE?

38:05.610 --> 38:08.977
THE STORM TOOK HIM.

38:12.090 --> 38:15.856
COME ON. IT'S OVER.

38:20.790 --> 38:22.929
IT'S OVER.

38:38.010 --> 38:39.568
HEY.

38:39.610 --> 38:42.374
HEY THERE.

38:43.120 --> 38:47.045
THE MEDIC SAYS THAT HER
VICTIM'S GOING TO BE OK.

38:49.060 --> 38:52.450
I HEARD WHAT
YOU DID IN THERE.

38:53.090 --> 38:56.059
YOUR DAD WOULD BE
REALLY PROUD.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.120
IT'S WEIRD.

38:58.160 --> 39:03.632
I SPENT ALL THIS TIME FOCUSED ON
CLOSING THIS CASE FOR HIM...

39:03.670 --> 39:06.104
AND NOW IT'S OVER.

39:06.140 --> 39:07.107
YEAH.

39:07.140 --> 39:11.645
I THOUGHT I'D FEEL HAPPY,
BUT I JUST FEEL LOST.

39:11.680 --> 39:14.615
BECAUSE YOU'VE
GOTTA TO MOVE ON.

39:14.650 --> 39:16.971
AND NOW YOU'RE LEAVING?

39:17.020 --> 39:22.856
HOW WILL I SURVIVE A WOMAN LIKE
YOU GOING SO FAR AWAY?

39:23.160 --> 39:28.120
WELL, DESPITE WHAT
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD...

39:29.160 --> 39:33.927
CELL PHONES CAN BE
VERY GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.002
SEE YA.

40:01.930 --> 40:03.124
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

40:03.160 --> 40:07.824
YOU'RE NOT ALL THAT HARD
TO PROFILE.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.933
YOUR FRIEND IS GOOD.

40:19.880 --> 40:23.748
I MISSED THAT PLANE
ON PURPOSE.

40:23.780 --> 40:25.839
I KNOW.

40:28.990 --> 40:30.480
I'M STRUGGLING.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.920
WELL. . .ANYBODY
WHO'S BEEN THROUGH

40:32.960 --> 40:35.952
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
RECENTLY...

40:36.000 --> 40:37.149
WOULD.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.088
THIS IS ALL
I WAS GROOMED FOR.

40:39.130 --> 40:40.222
I NEVER EVEN...

40:40.270 --> 40:42.465
I NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED
ANOTHER OPTION.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.058
NOW YOU'RE QUESTIONING
WHETHER OR NOT

40:44.100 --> 40:47.035
YOU'RE STRONG ENOUGH
TO BE HERE?

40:47.070 --> 40:48.469
YEAH.

40:48.510 --> 40:51.638
I HAVE BEEN
PLAYING AT THIS JOB

40:51.680 --> 40:56.140
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS.

40:56.750 --> 40:59.548
I'VE FELT LOST.

40:59.590 --> 41:01.558
I'VE FELT GREAT.

41:01.590 --> 41:05.788
I HAVE FELT SCARED,

41:05.830 --> 41:08.185
SICK,

41:08.230 --> 41:11.768
AND INSANE.

41:13.630 --> 41:15.666
I DON'T KNOW.

41:16.240 --> 41:22.770
I GUESS THE DAY THIS JOB STOPS
GNAWING AT YOUR SOUL AND...

41:22.810 --> 41:29.545
HANDS...YOUR HANDS
STOP FEELING COLD...

41:31.620 --> 41:35.158
MAYBE THAT'S THE TIME
TO LEAVE.

41:36.220 --> 41:38.950
I GUESS I JUST NEEDED
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

41:38.990 --> 41:42.153
IF I COULD STEP AWAY
FROM THIS JOB.

41:43.160 --> 41:45.720
AND?

41:46.730 --> 41:50.769
I'LL NEVER MISS
ANOTHER PLANE AGAIN.
