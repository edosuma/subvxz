01:02.686 --> 01:03.486
C'mon.

01:26.755 --> 01:29.983
Hey, Beckett. Why don't
I get to carry the rifle?

01:30.004 --> 01:31.875
'Cause you're too young.

01:49.832 --> 01:50.999
Try to keep up!

01:58.224 --> 01:59.457
Rowan!

02:03.686 --> 02:04.986
Rowan!

02:06.557 --> 02:07.857
Rowan!

02:07.858 --> 02:08.758
Run!

02:08.777 --> 02:10.978
Get away from my brother!

03:03.600 --> 03:05.833
OK. I'll be right back.

03:36.188 --> 03:36.988
Hey.

03:46.068 --> 03:48.268
Thanks for coming.

03:51.067 --> 03:53.767
- How are you?
- Oh... you know.

03:53.787 --> 03:55.387
Right.

04:13.030 --> 04:16.297
- What's all this?
- Yeah, that's new for you, isn't it?

04:16.317 --> 04:18.617
Loggin's taken over the whole area.

04:37.958 --> 04:40.025
I packed what I could.

04:40.045 --> 04:42.645
- There's a map and the trail is marked.
- Good.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.565
OK. Listen, I'm gonna set out tomorrow.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.585
I'll be gone three days, tops.

04:47.605 --> 04:49.605
Sit tight. Don't talk to anybody.

04:49.625 --> 04:53.725
I'm so sorry, but, you're the
only person he trusts.

04:53.745 --> 04:55.345
You did the right thing.

04:57.082 --> 04:59.282
We'll find Johnny. Don't you worry.

05:01.630 --> 05:02.630
I should get going.

05:04.525 --> 05:05.325
Rowan?

05:06.338 --> 05:07.571
Be careful.

06:12.952 --> 06:14.585
You're taking too many.

06:14.605 --> 06:16.305
It's not right.

06:16.325 --> 06:19.025
The mother's with cubs. It's off limits.

06:21.393 --> 06:22.993
It's gettin' late.

06:39.581 --> 06:41.248
I think we got a problem.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.168
Johnny Cadillac's not too happy.

06:55.897 --> 06:57.864
We're headin' back, tomorrow.

06:57.876 --> 06:58.809
No, we're not.

06:58.829 --> 07:02.429
- Well, you've taken enough, already.
- Sheriff gave us a week, to hunt.

07:02.449 --> 07:05.749
And you don't get paid until we're done.
You got that?

07:06.269 --> 07:08.269
I don't want your money.

07:18.648 --> 07:22.481
- This is gonna complicate things.
- I know pretty, when I see it.

07:22.501 --> 07:25.701
You stay here. I'll clean this shit up.

07:48.495 --> 07:49.395
Pike?

07:50.084 --> 07:51.117
What the...

08:34.787 --> 08:36.187
Well, hello!

08:37.316 --> 08:38.116
Hi.

08:38.135 --> 08:40.535
You gonna let a woman dance by herself?

08:42.309 --> 08:44.243
No, we can't have that.

09:17.073 --> 09:21.006
- Hey! Gently!
- I haven't... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:21.626 --> 09:23.626
Here we go. Here we go.

09:24.599 --> 09:27.566
Haven't been with a girl in a while, have you?

09:27.855 --> 09:29.488
You don't know the half of it.

09:38.693 --> 09:42.026
- I am gonna take care of you.
- C'mere, c'mere, c'mere.

09:42.046 --> 09:44.546
No. First you gotta take care of me.

09:44.566 --> 09:46.566
Guess you wanna be on the bed for that?

09:46.586 --> 09:51.486
- No. No, I was talking about money, dummy.
- The money?

09:52.106 --> 09:53.806
Yeah.

09:55.543 --> 09:56.543
Jesus.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.663
Listen, I, uh...

09:59.356 --> 10:01.389
OK, wait, wait. I didn't know this was...

10:01.409 --> 10:04.009
You know... no, no, no, no, no.

10:04.029 --> 10:06.029
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:06.049 --> 10:08.049
Hold up. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.769
- You have to go.
- What?

10:10.789 --> 10:12.389
You gotta go.

10:12.509 --> 10:16.185
Well, it doesn't really work like that.
I mean, you brought me here so...

10:16.206 --> 10:18.929
use me, or not, but you gotta pay.

10:18.949 --> 10:21.749
What'd you think? That this was
your lucky night, or some shit?

10:22.185 --> 10:26.118
- Come on, let's just...
- Just give me something, I...

10:26.174 --> 10:28.307
I can't go back like this.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.013
Come on.

10:33.189 --> 10:34.556
You gotta leave.

10:34.576 --> 10:36.176
Fuck you!

10:43.984 --> 10:48.517
<i>What the fuck did I tell you! Get the
fuckin' money first! Huh? Did I tell ya?</i>

10:48.537 --> 10:51.637
<i>Huh? What am I supposed to do, huh?
I always say get the fuckin' money.</i>

10:51.657 --> 10:55.157
<i>Huh? What? What? What?</i>

10:58.472 --> 11:00.672
Right? Right? Don't I always
fuckin' tellin' you that?

11:00.692 --> 11:02.692
Huh? Don't I?!

11:07.932 --> 11:10.665
This piece of shit here, huh? Yeah? Yeah.

11:24.838 --> 11:28.638
Hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hands where I can see 'em.

11:28.658 --> 11:30.658
Come on. Hey! Dammit! Get your hands up.

11:32.878 --> 11:35.878
Hey, wider. Ha-ha.

11:41.274 --> 11:44.174
Son of a bitch. Come here.

11:44.194 --> 11:46.794
Get up. Get up, you little shit.

11:47.145 --> 11:48.478
How'd you like that?

11:48.498 --> 11:50.698
- Fuck you!
- Shut up. Hands on your head.

11:50.718 --> 11:52.018
Get your head down.

11:56.060 --> 11:56.993
Beckett!

11:57.514 --> 12:00.214
- What's goin' on?
- Rowan's back.

12:00.234 --> 12:03.634
- Your Rowan? What's he doin' here?
- Hell if I know.

12:03.654 --> 12:05.954
- Please, give us a second.
- Hey.

12:06.274 --> 12:09.774
- Well, he got you pretty good, huh?
- That fuckin' psycho attacked me.

12:09.794 --> 12:11.794
Lemme see. Huh, yeah...

12:13.262 --> 12:14.529
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Fuckin' asshole!

12:14.548 --> 12:16.548
- Slow it down.
- God!

12:16.568 --> 12:19.968
This is a small... quiet town, Franco.

12:20.421 --> 12:25.254
Sully, here, is near retired. He doesn't
need trouble from a guy like you, so...

12:25.274 --> 12:29.074
I see you here again, you're gonna
get a lot more than a broken nose.

12:29.094 --> 12:31.094
Go on. Get outta here.

12:31.114 --> 12:32.714
What about her?

12:32.734 --> 12:36.234
I'll drive her home. You deal with your brother.

12:37.635 --> 12:38.502
Yeah...

12:47.805 --> 12:50.605
- What you doin' here?
- I grew up here, remember?

12:50.625 --> 12:53.625
- I remember. When'd you get out?
- What do you care?

12:56.786 --> 12:57.886
Seven years.

12:59.732 --> 13:02.599
Seven years, you come back here,
like some random act of violence.

13:02.619 --> 13:05.119
- You point a fuckin' gun at me?
- Police procedure, pal.

13:05.139 --> 13:07.739
- Fine. OK.
- No family discounts.

13:07.759 --> 13:10.059
Hey, you sure you got the
right guy, lawman? Really?

13:10.079 --> 13:14.679
No. When you left, I was worried sick about you.

13:14.699 --> 13:17.799
Then I heard what you did. That you shot a man.

13:18.319 --> 13:25.419
Then I said... No... no, that's not my brother.

13:27.171 --> 13:28.838
You know, dad...

13:29.158 --> 13:31.958
never mentioned your name, again.

13:32.178 --> 13:35.278
Mom, she, uh... she mourned
you, like you were dead.

13:36.298 --> 13:40.498
You know, I thought you'da learned by now, that
there's consequences to your actions, but...

13:41.918 --> 13:43.918
maybe you need another lesson.

13:46.438 --> 13:49.338
Boy, that's some boyfriend you got there, lady.

14:03.965 --> 14:05.632
Welcome home.

14:23.999 --> 14:25.866
You changed the place.

14:26.389 --> 14:27.389
Yeah.

14:29.548 --> 14:30.548
Yeah.

14:31.368 --> 14:33.368
There's a new boss of the house.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.365
Where's she?

14:38.752 --> 14:40.152
She's out in the bush.

14:52.569 --> 14:55.769
- Michelle needed a workspace, so...
- Yeah.

14:59.181 --> 15:03.048
She was a photojournalist, from
the east coast. She, uh...

15:03.068 --> 15:07.368
fell in love with the wildlife,
became a biologist, a researcher...

15:07.388 --> 15:11.388
- Now, she's out on the trail, almost every day.
- This her, here?

15:11.408 --> 15:12.608
Yeah.

15:12.628 --> 15:14.628
Conservationist, huh?

15:14.648 --> 15:16.648
How'd you get her to marry you?

15:17.468 --> 15:19.668
I put away my hunting rifle.

15:22.610 --> 15:25.510
- For good?
- Yep.

15:27.808 --> 15:31.008
- What's this?
- Radio frequency identifications..

15:31.028 --> 15:34.528
We've collared about 200 animals,
in the past couple years.

15:34.548 --> 15:36.948
Had to wear one of these on my ankle, for a year.

15:38.568 --> 15:40.568
Why are you here, Rowan?

15:42.754 --> 15:46.887
I was gonna go out to the Grizzly Maze and pay
respect to dad, where it really meant something.

15:46.907 --> 15:49.907
Couple of nights, come back, disappear,
and you wouldn't even know I was here.

15:49.927 --> 15:51.927
I'm not here to mess with your life.

15:53.056 --> 15:57.256
- Why don't you pay your respects to both of them?
- Well, yeah. That was the plan. I was gonna...

15:58.476 --> 15:59.676
Yeah.

16:00.296 --> 16:05.096
Well, you can sleep in my old room... if you want.

16:05.116 --> 16:07.116
Think I'll take the couch.

16:45.610 --> 16:47.210
Keep your eyes out.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.500
Hey!

16:56.587 --> 17:00.787
- So, what do we got?
- Right there, just like I said.

18:00.660 --> 18:01.460
Marcus!

18:05.062 --> 18:05.895
Marcus!?

18:10.207 --> 18:11.074
Marcus!

19:20.634 --> 19:22.967
Don't even think about it.

19:26.277 --> 19:27.710
Hey, listen...

19:27.730 --> 19:29.430
My parole is done.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.950
I'm a free man, so...

19:32.370 --> 19:34.370
technically, half of all this, is mine.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.909
Well... well, I don't mean
to burst your bubble, Rowan,

19:36.930 --> 19:39.710
but I don't think you made it into the will.

19:41.576 --> 19:43.709
Don't worry, I'll be gone, soon.

19:44.930 --> 19:46.930
Hey, uh...

19:46.950 --> 19:50.116
I was gonna go join Michelle, a
little later, out at dad's flats, and

19:50.137 --> 19:53.570
check on some snares and,
if you wanna wait for me...

19:53.590 --> 19:55.990
Yeah, thanks, but, uh... I
gotta do this one alone.

19:56.610 --> 19:58.410
Yeah. Great.

20:09.073 --> 20:10.940
Hey, uh...

20:14.422 --> 20:16.722
Now that you're a free man.

20:23.415 --> 20:24.615
Yeah.

20:33.415 --> 20:35.148
It was like a lifetime ago.

20:38.566 --> 20:39.766
Yeah.

20:39.786 --> 20:42.786
Well, I gotta get to work, so,
I'll meet you upstairs, uh...

20:43.774 --> 20:44.907
Alright.

20:50.794 --> 20:53.527
<i>Beckett. Come in, Beckett.</i>

20:58.788 --> 21:00.388
<i>Beckett, you there?</i>

21:01.408 --> 21:03.008
<i>Come in, Beckett.</i>

21:05.797 --> 21:07.097
Yeah, go ahead.

21:07.117 --> 21:10.417
<i>Somethin's gone down at Gordon's clearcut.
Meet me there.</i>

21:10.437 --> 21:12.437
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

21:19.760 --> 21:21.060
Come on, we gotta go.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.380
It's OK. Why don't you go serve and protect?

21:26.800 --> 21:29.400
Somethin' up at the clearcut.
I'll give you a ride.

21:29.820 --> 21:31.220
It's on my way.

21:36.577 --> 21:38.910
Sheriff, it's a real mess up there.

21:38.930 --> 21:42.686
But I got a lotta family men on
payroll, so I wanna make sure that

21:42.707 --> 21:46.350
whoever, whatever did this, is
stopped, sooner rather than later.

21:46.370 --> 21:49.070
- We'll take care of it.
- Get this cleaned up.

22:13.677 --> 22:15.944
Bear spray and a tranquilizer gun?

22:15.964 --> 22:19.964
Yeah, I thought about usin' it on the bastards
that've been huntin' around here without a permit.

22:19.984 --> 22:21.984
Jesus! Who the hell are you?

22:22.004 --> 22:26.604
I don't know. Talkin' about
makin' the maze a protected zone.

22:26.624 --> 22:28.624
Dad would've appreciated that.

22:28.644 --> 22:34.544
Yeah. You know, we'll be campin' out there
in dad's flats, if you change your mind.

22:36.139 --> 22:40.872
I'll probably be in the maze, by then, so...
but... thanks.

22:44.869 --> 22:46.536
What're you up to, Rowan?

22:48.156 --> 22:53.456
I was gonna wait for you to leave and... go rob a
bank, you know, score a fix. The usual, you know.

22:53.476 --> 22:57.176
- I know you. Somethin's up.
- You don't know me.

24:19.616 --> 24:21.683
We got a real mess.

24:21.703 --> 24:25.703
- Couple bootleg cutters, or what's left of 'em...
- Yeah?

24:25.723 --> 24:28.523
- Blood everywhere, no bodies.
- Jesus.

24:28.543 --> 24:31.243
- Yeah.
- Last night or this morning?

24:31.263 --> 24:34.263
I don't know. We'll get up there.
See what's going on.

24:34.283 --> 24:35.683
Hey, Kaley.

24:35.703 --> 24:37.103
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:37.123 --> 24:40.323
Coroner's on his way. He wanted me to
come up and start collecting the remains.

24:40.343 --> 24:43.943
Kaley... what we gonna do without you?

24:43.963 --> 24:45.963
I guess he'll have to get his hands dirty.

24:45.983 --> 24:48.383
Oh, yeah. They had a dog, too.

24:59.467 --> 25:01.534
- Hi, folks.
- What's goin' on?

25:01.554 --> 25:03.954
- Well, the guns weren't fired.
- Uh-huh.

25:03.974 --> 25:07.776
One of the saws is still in the
tree, hand clutching the trigger.

25:07.797 --> 25:10.270
Some body parts scattered,
but most of it's gone.

25:10.291 --> 25:11.514
Uh-huh.

25:11.534 --> 25:14.734
- Yeah, it's a bear.
- You're goddam right, it's a bear.

25:15.954 --> 25:17.654
It's a nasty one, too.

25:18.474 --> 25:22.674
What the hell kind of animal would come
around a man with a runnin' chainsaw?

25:23.094 --> 25:25.094
I ain't ever seen that before.

25:25.914 --> 25:29.614
- Well, he's certainly hungry.
- No. Desperate's more like it, uh...

25:29.634 --> 25:32.034
it's when they get dangerous,
when they're desperate.

25:32.054 --> 25:34.754
Douglas, what're you doin' here, huh?

25:35.174 --> 25:38.274
It's a crime scene. Go on.

25:38.294 --> 25:42.594
I was huntin' bears when you were still
playin' with tiddly winks, asshole.

25:42.614 --> 25:46.714
Back to business, I wouldn't be a bit surprised
this wasn't one of your pets that done it.

25:46.734 --> 25:48.334
You got a bear around here?

25:48.354 --> 25:50.854
No, I don't have a bear around here.
It's not one of my collars.

25:50.874 --> 25:53.374
What're you. some kind of psychic?

25:53.994 --> 25:55.794
Let's check the signals.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.014
Beckett.

25:58.434 --> 26:01.634
- Check the fuckin' signals.
- Yeah, I'll check. I'll check 'em.

26:01.654 --> 26:03.954
- Alright, that's our current position, right now.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:03.974 --> 26:06.674
- And... yeah, there's one bear.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:06.694 --> 26:09.394
Sheriff, it looks like you
want me to go huntin' now, huh?

26:09.414 --> 26:10.814
You got the money, I got the time.

26:10.834 --> 26:13.734
Hey, hey, hey. You can't
shoot a collared bear, pal.

26:13.754 --> 26:16.154
OK? You understand? That's the law. Alright?

26:16.174 --> 26:17.974
- Not without proof, understand?
- Back up. Back up, there.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.294
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You understand the law?

26:19.314 --> 26:21.014
- What?
- You're wife's out there.

26:21.034 --> 26:23.834
You brother. You're worried about a fuckin' bear?

26:23.854 --> 26:26.054
Somebody's gonna go after this thing.

26:26.074 --> 26:27.874
He's the best tracker I know.

26:27.894 --> 26:30.794
He's a butcher, OK? That's all he is.

26:30.814 --> 26:35.114
I'm gonna go out there myself. I'll get Michelle
out and I'll capture the damn bear, OK?

26:35.134 --> 26:38.834
You wanna use this guy so bad, have him
set up traps around here, in this area.

26:38.854 --> 26:40.754
But he stays the hell away from the forest.

26:40.774 --> 26:43.574
- Alright? I mean it.
- Anything you say, Deputy.

26:43.594 --> 26:48.494
I'm just here to help. But just so you
know, this ain't your average bear.

26:48.514 --> 26:50.114
This is a clever one.

26:50.173 --> 26:53.493
I mean, how you think somethin'
that big can hide that good and

26:53.514 --> 26:57.093
surprise two men in a clearing before
they can get even one shot off?

26:57.513 --> 26:59.913
It's a smart fucker, that's how.

26:59.933 --> 27:02.433
You never met a bear like this, before, Beckett.

27:02.453 --> 27:04.153
And if you did, you wouldn't
know what to do with it.

27:04.173 --> 27:06.073
- Alright, are you done?
- Yeah, I'm done.

27:06.093 --> 27:06.993
OK.

27:07.013 --> 27:09.913
- I'm just tellin' ya.
- And I'm hearin' ya.

27:11.233 --> 27:15.233
Sully, call me after you find the
next body, 'cause you will find it.

27:15.253 --> 27:16.453
Beckett!

27:18.624 --> 27:24.757
When you're out there... and you see that, listen
to me... and you see that bear, you kill it.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.877
Now go up there, find your wife
and get her the hell outta there.

27:27.897 --> 27:30.097
I'll close down the trails. Go on.

27:32.502 --> 27:33.569
Hey, Beckett.

27:34.189 --> 27:35.789
I'm comin' with you.

27:35.809 --> 27:40.009
Gerry, find out how many people we got out
there and find a way to get 'em back.

27:40.029 --> 27:43.929
Zoe, put out signs. Close all the trails.
Close 'em all.

27:43.949 --> 27:45.349
- You got it, boss.
 - Alright.

28:59.783 --> 29:00.616
Sheriff?

29:01.436 --> 29:04.036
- You gotta shut down for a couple days.
- What?

29:04.056 --> 29:05.356
There's nothin' else we can do.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.695
Do you know how much money that is?

29:08.715 --> 29:11.415
Can't you call someone to help
bring in the cavalry or somethin'?

29:11.435 --> 29:16.835
Mr. Jordan, you've gotta understand. Those
loggers were killed by a rogue bear.

29:16.855 --> 29:20.255
But out there, is the Grizzly Maze.

29:20.275 --> 29:24.375
That's some of the roughest, most
dangerous terrain in Alaska.

29:24.395 --> 29:27.495
I don't care how good a hunter
you are, or how experienced...

29:27.515 --> 29:31.093
You go in there without a local guide,
without somebody who grew up here,

29:31.114 --> 29:34.635
somebody who really knows the
trails, you're gonna die.

29:34.655 --> 29:37.455
- Ah!
 - You gotta trust the locals on this.

29:37.975 --> 29:40.675
Beckett's been out there since he was a kid.

29:40.695 --> 29:45.095
- He'll find that bear.
- Yeah, b... must be somebody to help him.

29:54.086 --> 29:58.186
Here. You mind... carryin' this for me?

29:58.506 --> 30:02.006
- It's a tranquilizer gun.
- You really wanna capture this bear?

30:02.026 --> 30:04.026
Well, I... prefer to save it.

30:06.520 --> 30:07.587
Just in case.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.007
Watch it.

30:15.101 --> 30:16.334
C'mon, Kaley.

30:19.850 --> 30:23.150
Michelle can't be too far ahead,
if she left this morning.

30:23.170 --> 30:25.370
We gotta catch her before she heads off trail.

30:25.390 --> 30:27.190
Why would she do that?

30:27.210 --> 30:31.910
Snares. She likes to set 'em when,
when she finds a bear trail.

30:36.243 --> 30:38.176
Look, why don't you head back?

30:38.196 --> 30:39.096
OK?

30:39.716 --> 30:42.716
Look, I wanna help, I'm not
gonna slow you down, OK?

30:43.136 --> 30:45.936
Rowan's out here fast. You know that.

30:45.956 --> 30:48.256
- And why is he here?
- Hell if I know.

32:25.699 --> 32:26.666
You OK?

32:28.271 --> 32:30.404
Oh, boy. We need to get outta here.

32:31.735 --> 32:32.801
Gimme your hand.

32:35.683 --> 32:36.750
You're Michelle.

32:37.370 --> 32:39.370
I'm-I'm Rowan. I'm Beckett's brother.

32:42.796 --> 32:45.729
Holy shit! You're deaf! We
gotta get you outta here.

32:45.749 --> 32:47.149
Lemme get, here...

32:47.169 --> 32:48.469
Alright, alright, alright, alright. Here.

32:48.489 --> 32:51.989
Do you have... Listen, do
you have a first-aid kit?

32:52.009 --> 32:53.609
First-aid? A bandage?

32:58.893 --> 33:00.293
I'm deaf, not stupid.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.713
Fair enough. You read lips?

33:03.933 --> 33:05.133
Where is it, then?

33:05.553 --> 33:07.653
Over here? OK.

33:24.798 --> 33:26.865
- You ready? Come on.
- Yeah.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.720
Sheriff's department.

34:03.340 --> 34:04.940
Douglas, you in there?

34:06.793 --> 34:09.693
Yo, Douglas! It's Sully. You here?

34:25.196 --> 34:26.329
Douglas?

34:58.635 --> 35:01.435
Sully, you nearly got your head blown off.

35:01.455 --> 35:06.255
Listen, Douglas, if you're still up
for it I want ya to kill this bear.

35:08.175 --> 35:10.442
Thought Beckett was gonna adopt it, or somethin'.

35:10.462 --> 35:14.062
He's lookin' for his wife. I need a hunter.

35:14.282 --> 35:16.282
So, that's why you're comin' to me, now?

35:17.087 --> 35:18.487
Sure. Why else?

35:19.327 --> 35:22.587
I dunno, maybe you're worried that
people might think it's your fault

35:22.608 --> 35:25.681
for lettin' assholes like Johnny
Cadillac take poachers out there?

35:25.700 --> 35:28.826
I mean, I'm not judgin' ya, Sully.
I can't even say I blame ya.

35:28.847 --> 35:31.920
I mean, a man's gotta do what he's
gotta do to survive. But, uh...

35:31.940 --> 35:35.740
With all the loggers and poachers,
out there, it upsets the balance.

35:35.760 --> 35:41.260
See, this bear, it... it's not
just territorial, or hungry...

35:41.480 --> 35:43.080
What is it?

35:43.700 --> 35:45.500
It's pissed off.

35:45.920 --> 35:48.620
Just a case of mother nature fightin' back.

35:49.040 --> 35:51.940
You're welcome to stay,
Sully, but I got shit to do.

35:56.247 --> 36:00.480
I just need you to kill this fuckin' bear.
The sooner, the better.

36:01.567 --> 36:04.267
Sully, I've been waitin' on
this bear my whole life.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.287
I'm just surprised it took this long.

36:07.107 --> 36:08.707
<i>Hey, Sheriff, come in?</i>

36:09.888 --> 36:11.055
Yeah, Zoe.

36:11.075 --> 36:15.649
I, uh... just posted a sign at Skyline.
I found something, here.

36:15.669 --> 36:17.794
I think you guys should come take a look.

36:17.814 --> 36:20.814
- <i>What is it?</i>
- It's Johnny Cadillac's car.

36:21.534 --> 36:23.434
Any sign of him?

36:24.254 --> 36:26.254
Huh-uh. It's been here awhile.

36:27.874 --> 36:28.674
Sheriff?

36:30.294 --> 36:31.194
Zoe?

36:36.031 --> 36:37.198
Zoe! Come in!

36:42.749 --> 36:43.649
Zoe!

36:51.887 --> 36:54.620
- I'll call ya when it's done.
- Let's go.

37:00.263 --> 37:01.596
<i>Beckett, come in!</i>

37:03.293 --> 37:04.593
<i>Beckett, come in!</i>

37:06.213 --> 37:07.813
Hey, go, Sully.

37:07.833 --> 37:09.433
- You find Michelle?
- <i>No.</i>

37:09.453 --> 37:10.853
No, not yet.

37:10.873 --> 37:12.873
I sent Douglas after the bear.

37:12.893 --> 37:16.493
- Ah, Christ, Sully, why the hell...
- <i>There's been another attack.</i>

37:17.513 --> 37:20.613
Zoe. I think she's gone.

37:24.541 --> 37:26.741
- Where?
 - <i>Skyline Trailhead.</i>

37:26.761 --> 37:28.961
<i>Found a car. Johnny Cadillac's.</i>

37:28.981 --> 37:30.981
This bear's near ya, son.

37:31.001 --> 37:33.801
Find your wife. Get the hell outta there.

37:33.821 --> 37:35.121
Yeah.

37:35.541 --> 37:37.541
Copy that. OK, thanks.

37:39.681 --> 37:41.848
- You ever use one of these?
- Yeah.

37:42.168 --> 37:46.168
Thumb down, safety off. Alright?

37:46.588 --> 37:48.688
Won't stop a bear, but...

37:50.196 --> 37:51.396
might scare it.

37:52.510 --> 37:53.510
Maybe.

38:08.706 --> 38:09.572
You OK?

38:11.948 --> 38:12.748
OK.

38:13.268 --> 38:15.768
I'm gonna pitch the tent, make a fire.

38:15.988 --> 38:16.988
Alright?

38:17.508 --> 38:18.508
OK.

38:19.328 --> 38:20.928
Here we go.

38:24.077 --> 38:25.610
Oh, shit, Zoe.

38:34.209 --> 38:35.276
Stay cool.

38:36.096 --> 38:38.096
One step at a time.

38:38.116 --> 38:40.816
Whaddaya think happened to
Johnny and those poachers?

38:40.836 --> 38:42.536
I figure they're gone, too.

38:42.556 --> 38:44.056
You don't know that.

38:44.076 --> 38:49.076
It's been twelve days. Twelve days,
Gerry, and they're not back yet.

38:51.653 --> 38:54.853
Sully, maybe you need to come clean on this.

38:54.873 --> 38:57.673
Zoe's dead. What else you gonna do?

38:58.493 --> 39:02.093
Give Beckett some help. Worry
about the rest, later.

39:15.732 --> 39:16.799
Holy shit.

39:24.734 --> 39:26.534
She used her bear spray.

39:26.554 --> 39:28.554
What the hell happened here?

39:30.993 --> 39:33.026
I'm deaf, not stupid.

39:33.746 --> 39:35.746
I think she met Rowan.

39:35.766 --> 39:39.866
<i>Douglas and Beckett's dad were the
same kind of hunters, old school.</i>

39:39.886 --> 39:42.986
- Lived on what they got.
- Thought they were guides.

39:43.006 --> 39:48.606
Yeah, to pay the rent, now and then, but they'd
never take hunters into the Grizzly Maze.

39:48.626 --> 39:51.326
Never. Place was sacred to 'em.

39:51.346 --> 39:56.246
Then, one night... Douglas was
out with four Canadians...

39:56.266 --> 39:59.166
Bear got into their camp.

39:59.186 --> 40:02.760
Attacked Douglas, in his
sleep and Douglas managed to

40:02.981 --> 40:06.806
get his knife out and stab
the bear, under the chin.

40:06.826 --> 40:09.326
Right in the jugular. Saved his ass.

40:09.946 --> 40:12.846
- Jesus! That's impressive!
- Yeah.

40:13.466 --> 40:15.466
But he snapped...

40:16.686 --> 40:20.186
Week after he got out of the
hospital, he went back out there.

40:20.206 --> 40:23.506
Inside a few days, killed over 20 bears,

40:23.526 --> 40:25.526
left 'em all to rot on the ground.

40:25.546 --> 40:29.246
Then he started takin' hunters
into the maze, makin' money.

40:29.866 --> 40:33.366
Beckett's dad never talked to him, after that.

40:37.234 --> 40:39.234
- Ya alright?
- I got it.

40:45.649 --> 40:46.782
Welcome.

40:47.202 --> 40:49.202
Welcome to dad's flats.

40:49.822 --> 40:51.022
Wow.

40:52.242 --> 40:54.242
I've never been over this side of the ridge.

41:00.309 --> 41:01.509
Hey.

41:09.973 --> 41:11.073
Hey!

41:11.293 --> 41:12.393
Hi!

41:16.980 --> 41:19.380
Bad girl. What happened to your leg?

41:19.600 --> 41:21.600
Here, let me take a look.

41:21.820 --> 41:23.320
Yeah, will ya?

41:27.060 --> 41:30.560
Bear. Rowan, O-K.

41:31.180 --> 41:32.680
Where is he?

41:34.507 --> 41:36.674
You sure you're OK?

41:49.240 --> 41:51.173
Mind moving from there?

41:52.793 --> 41:54.693
Makin' me nervous.

41:58.487 --> 42:01.120
So that's the infamous Grizzly Maze.

42:01.140 --> 42:03.140
Yeah, that's what my dad used to call it.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.460
'Cause even grizzly's can get lost down there.

42:09.963 --> 42:13.830
- You remember.
- Of course, I do.

42:16.161 --> 42:19.394
Why are you... why are you here?
What are you doin' up here?

42:19.614 --> 42:22.114
- Came with Beckett.
- Oh.

42:22.134 --> 42:24.034
He's down there.

42:24.054 --> 42:25.654
Came to find Michelle.

43:11.484 --> 43:15.351
- Excuse me.
- Hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'?

43:16.382 --> 43:17.315
Leavin'.

43:17.335 --> 43:21.335
No, you're not, alright? No, 'cause I need you
to take the girls back down, tomorrow, OK?

43:21.355 --> 43:25.455
There's a killer bear out here. Three people
are already dead. I need to get after it.

43:27.241 --> 43:29.270
Hey, hey! You hear what I said?
You're not leavin'!

43:29.291 --> 43:30.695
I'm not asking your permission.

43:30.715 --> 43:33.015
- Alright, guys. Just relax.
- Kaley... stay out of it.

43:33.035 --> 43:36.135
You lied to me. You wanna tell
me about Johnny Cadillac?

43:36.155 --> 43:38.155
- Get out of my way.
- No!

43:38.175 --> 43:41.275
You're gonna tell me what the hell you're
doin' out here, or I'm going to arrest ya.

43:41.295 --> 43:44.695
Ha! You're gonna arrest me?
For carryin' bear insurance.

43:44.715 --> 43:47.715
Nope. For illegal possession of a firearm.

43:54.927 --> 43:56.027
Hey! Hey!

43:58.524 --> 43:59.757
Guys, come on!

43:59.977 --> 44:01.677
Are you done, yet?!

44:13.643 --> 44:15.043
What're you, fucking twelve?

44:16.544 --> 44:17.544
Jesus!

44:22.180 --> 44:25.113
Johnny was supposed to be back five days ago.

44:25.433 --> 44:28.533
Took poachers into the maze, never came back.

44:28.553 --> 44:31.453
Mary called me. Didn't wanna come to you.
Didn't wanna come to Sully.

44:31.473 --> 44:33.173
Thought you'd throw him in jail.

44:33.193 --> 44:34.693
That's what I'm here for.

44:36.050 --> 44:38.783
To help the one guy, who stood up for me.

44:38.803 --> 44:40.803
Thought it'd be a great idea to hide it from me?

44:41.723 --> 44:45.123
Three people dead. Michelle got attacked.

44:45.143 --> 44:49.043
- Yeah, that's right, and I saved her life.
- That's not what I'm talkin' about, dumbass!

44:49.063 --> 44:53.263
I tell you my wife is out here
campin' and you keep quiet?

44:55.083 --> 44:58.583
Johnny Cadillac and a couple of
poachers didn't go down by no bear.

44:58.603 --> 45:02.903
You take the girls home, tomorrow.
If I see your bear, I'll kill it.

45:02.923 --> 45:04.023
Fine.

45:08.890 --> 45:11.590
Come on, at least stay the night.
Go back in the morning.

45:12.310 --> 45:15.010
Grizzly out here might be comin' around.

45:17.038 --> 45:18.138
Please.

45:51.995 --> 45:55.128
All my other collars are... migrating north...

45:55.148 --> 45:57.648
in a pretty big radius.

46:00.108 --> 46:03.908
Michelle says, uh, she thinks
the bear is just scared.

46:03.928 --> 46:08.128
Looks like they're all leavin' the maze, you know?
Like they're runnin' from somethin'.

46:08.148 --> 46:10.848
That's gotta be the same bear
that went after Michelle.

46:10.868 --> 46:13.068
Yeah. Did you get a good look at him?

46:13.088 --> 46:15.888
No, he stayed off in the woods.

46:15.908 --> 46:18.408
It's almost like he knew better
than to give me a clean shot.

46:18.428 --> 46:20.428
That was the biggest bear I've ever seen.

46:21.848 --> 46:25.348
Michelle says that it's... she
never got a chance to thank you.

46:28.863 --> 46:29.996
It's OK.

46:34.601 --> 46:38.668
And... I'm-I'm sorry, OK?

46:40.310 --> 46:42.577
I could really use your help on this.

46:42.597 --> 46:46.397
Look, I'm not givin' up on Johnny, so whatever
you need from me, just don't ask me to do that.

46:46.417 --> 46:49.217
And if Douglas is out there, he's
gonna beat us to it, anyway.

46:49.237 --> 46:51.237
That's what I'm afraid of.

46:51.257 --> 46:55.057
Do you wanna kill this bear, or do you wanna
save it? You gotta make up your mind.

46:55.077 --> 46:57.077
I wanna kill the right bear.

46:57.097 --> 46:59.097
Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding me!

46:59.117 --> 47:00.917
I got a friend out there that needs my help.

47:00.937 --> 47:03.283
And if he gets killed out here,
runnin' around in the woods,

47:03.304 --> 47:05.457
poachin' bears, then he got
what he deserved, didn't he?

47:05.477 --> 47:07.477
You're a righteous prick.

47:08.836 --> 47:10.703
I'll take first watch.

47:21.919 --> 47:23.786
Did a nice job on her ankle.

47:25.611 --> 47:29.578
- Is it bad?
- No. It's OK. She'll walk.

47:30.173 --> 47:32.073
Assuming I can keep it from getting infected.

47:32.893 --> 47:34.893
So, you're a doctor, now... huh?

47:36.113 --> 47:40.213
That's funny, I... always
figured you'd leave this place.

47:42.166 --> 47:43.266
I am.

47:44.858 --> 47:46.125
In two weeks.

47:47.711 --> 47:48.844
Toronto.

47:50.582 --> 47:51.649
Really?

47:53.170 --> 47:56.503
Do you know how many times I tried to contact you?

47:59.825 --> 48:01.892
What do you want from me?

48:02.361 --> 48:03.528
I don't know.

48:04.865 --> 48:06.032
Some answers.

48:08.779 --> 48:12.646
Stick to what you believe.
It's as good a story as any.

48:14.750 --> 48:18.683
I once had my whole life planned
out, with you, in my head.

48:20.299 --> 48:22.366
What was I thinkin', huh?

48:24.005 --> 48:25.272
G'night.

49:36.945 --> 49:37.845
Kaley!

49:38.626 --> 49:41.126
Gimme your hand, gimme your hand!

49:49.002 --> 49:49.802
Kaley!

49:51.912 --> 49:52.712
Hey!

49:54.074 --> 49:54.874
Hey!

50:02.395 --> 50:03.862
Shoot, goddammit!

50:17.612 --> 50:18.945
You hurt? He get ya?

50:21.392 --> 50:23.858
Looks like your bear was trackin' us.

50:26.606 --> 50:28.639
Let's get our shit and get outta here.

50:48.502 --> 50:52.035
You mind explainin' to me what that was all about?

50:52.795 --> 50:54.428
You know what I'm talkin' about.

50:54.448 --> 50:56.448
- I didn't have a shot.
- You didn't have a shot?

50:56.468 --> 50:58.668
Come on. You might not get a better one.

50:59.088 --> 51:01.088
What were you doin' in that tent?

51:01.917 --> 51:04.017
- What?
- Shoulda been outside.

51:04.437 --> 51:06.837
- Was freezin' outside.
- Uh-huh.

51:12.276 --> 51:14.209
<i>Oh, come on... you were cold.</i>

51:25.211 --> 51:26.278
-What's goin' on?
- What's wrong?

51:31.552 --> 51:34.319
-Move yourself, right now.
- Get her arm, get her arm.

51:39.025 --> 51:40.025
You alright?

51:45.399 --> 51:47.132
We're in the kill zone.

51:47.818 --> 51:50.752
- Let's get outta here.
- Yeah. Let's move. C'mon.

52:10.012 --> 52:13.712
Damn. What do you think we should do?

52:14.844 --> 52:16.555
Let's just stick to Johnny's trail.

52:16.576 --> 52:19.264
I don't wanna take these
girls down in that maze.

52:19.284 --> 52:21.907
We should stick to Johnny's trail. It leads us,

52:21.927 --> 52:24.503
right down to Teredo Point, it's
just on the other side of the maze.

52:24.523 --> 52:28.523
We radio Sully. He can come in,
pick us up, take us out by boat.

52:33.221 --> 52:36.088
Wanna go back up that way, the way we came?

52:37.343 --> 52:41.643
- He's on our trail.
- Alright, let's try to lose him in the maze.

52:42.481 --> 52:43.947
It's our only shot.

52:57.288 --> 52:59.621
Sullivan, this is Beckett. Come in.

53:14.982 --> 53:15.982
Sully, wait up.

53:17.084 --> 53:23.384
Appreciate the help, Gerry, but I told ya already,
I need you back here to keep everybody calm.

53:23.404 --> 53:24.504
You're not going in there alone.

53:24.524 --> 53:28.324
If you haven't heard from me, by
tomorrow afternoon, call Fish and Game.

53:28.344 --> 53:32.144
- I should go with ya.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

53:49.426 --> 53:50.359
Douglas!

53:51.179 --> 53:53.179
Man, that better not be one of my bears!

53:53.836 --> 53:55.536
Are you lookin' for this?

53:56.149 --> 54:00.415
Dammit! I told you, man. If you
fuck with one of my bears again...

54:02.331 --> 54:04.831
- I'll deal with it.
- I'll be damned! Rowan, is that you back there?

54:05.051 --> 54:08.151
They let you out? I guess I was wrong.

54:08.171 --> 54:09.971
There is a fellow hunter out here with me.

54:09.991 --> 54:12.591
I's just fixin' to cut this thing
open, you wanna come help me with it?

54:12.611 --> 54:15.111
I'd rather not. Back the fuck up!

54:15.131 --> 54:16.731
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

54:16.751 --> 54:20.451
There's a camera on there, ya butcher! All
we gotta do is plug it in, see what he ate.

54:20.471 --> 54:22.571
Don't you go soft on me, too, son.

54:22.591 --> 54:25.239
Your brother, Beckett, here,
he thinks he knows bears

54:25.260 --> 54:27.711
'cause he puts them cute little necklaces on 'em.

54:27.731 --> 54:31.731
- But you and me know when there's a problem.
- You're the only fuckin' problem here, old man.

54:33.569 --> 54:36.302
Hey, Rowan, now you been gone a long time, bud.

54:36.322 --> 54:39.122
Lotta strange shit's happenin' around here.

54:39.742 --> 54:44.042
Beetle outbreaks. Salmon don't
swim upstream like they used to.

54:44.362 --> 54:46.362
Bears ain't got anything to eat.

54:46.782 --> 54:49.882
Throw people into that mix,
you're askin' for trouble.

54:49.902 --> 54:55.402
'Cause when a grizzly gets angry he don't give
a shit if you're a logger or a tree hugger.

54:56.222 --> 54:58.222
All of ya taste the same.

54:58.242 --> 55:01.242
Anyway, this ain't our bear.

55:01.262 --> 55:06.762
Don't look so sad, honey. That one was hurt, just
limpin' around. I just put it out of it's misery.

55:07.677 --> 55:12.810
But somewhere around here... there's a real rogue.

55:12.830 --> 55:15.630
A big, nasty, mean son of a bitch,

55:15.650 --> 55:18.950
and he don't give a shit what's
in his way, he'll eat it.

55:18.970 --> 55:20.570
Anything to survive.

55:20.590 --> 55:24.444
When a bear like that encounters man
for the first time, he just looks

55:24.465 --> 55:28.210
at him as a predator he's gotta get
rid of, 'fore it gets rid of him.

55:29.842 --> 55:33.042
- Yeah, well, let's find out.
- What you got?

55:39.824 --> 55:42.691
Holy shit! That's the bear from last night.

55:42.711 --> 55:46.811
See there? I told you so. Ripped
the collar off and broke his neck.

55:48.203 --> 55:49.403
Looks it. Yeah.

55:52.909 --> 55:56.309
Well, if y'all do run into him again...

55:56.929 --> 55:59.709
Split up to a 180. That way somebody can get a

55:59.730 --> 56:02.349
side shot, 'cause if he's
chargin', you won't get 'im.

56:03.735 --> 56:05.335
Y'all have fun.

56:07.198 --> 56:10.731
Ya say, Beck? Still wanna
play darts with this thing?

56:16.690 --> 56:17.757
I like it.

56:42.445 --> 56:43.345
Bear!

57:01.744 --> 57:02.811
Watch your step!

57:15.990 --> 57:16.790
No!

57:16.879 --> 57:17.679
Jesus!

57:17.699 --> 57:18.699
Kaley!

57:28.539 --> 57:29.439
Oh, my...

57:39.796 --> 57:41.696
- Tell me what to do. What do I do?
- OK.

57:41.716 --> 57:43.016
You need to cut the branch.

57:43.036 --> 57:45.036
- Cut the branch.
- Yeah.

57:46.520 --> 57:48.720
OK. You're OK. We're gonna get you outta here.

57:48.740 --> 57:49.940
It's not as bad as it looks.

57:49.960 --> 57:52.860
OK. Alright. Is anything broken?
Alright. Think it's broken?

57:52.880 --> 57:54.880
I gotta see it. I gotta see it.

57:55.337 --> 57:56.604
- Let's cut this off.
- How red's it get?

58:03.715 --> 58:04.615
It's fucking...

58:11.496 --> 58:13.063
You gotta pull it out.

58:13.116 --> 58:15.116
- What?
- You gotta pull it out.

58:15.136 --> 58:16.736
We got-you gotta pull it out.
You gotta pull it out.

58:16.756 --> 58:19.456
No, no, no. We pull it out,
she's gonna lose a lotta blood.

58:19.476 --> 58:20.776
Walkin' around with a stick in her leg?

58:20.796 --> 58:22.396
Well, just gimme a second. I can cut it off.

58:22.416 --> 58:24.716
- Then we're still hangin' around...
- No, no, don't, no. Just pull it out, OK?

58:24.736 --> 58:27.336
We're gonna stop the bleeding.
I can get up and stitch, OK?

58:27.356 --> 58:29.556
Just stabilize the ankle and
then he can pull it out.

58:32.214 --> 58:35.614
- I'll get the knee, you get the ankle.
- Alright. Keep it steady.

58:36.534 --> 58:37.434
OK.

58:37.454 --> 58:38.854
OK. On three, alright?

58:38.874 --> 58:43.174
- Ah!
- One, two... three.

58:45.575 --> 58:46.475
OK.

58:48.830 --> 58:49.930
God!

58:53.305 --> 58:56.072
- Almost done.
- Pressure, pressure.

58:56.092 --> 58:58.092
Gauze! Here's some gauze.

58:58.512 --> 59:00.512
- OK. Put this, on here.
- Both sides.

59:05.283 --> 59:07.483
W-what'd she say? What'd she say?

59:07.503 --> 59:10.503
When a bear smells the blood... we
gotta get rid of these clothes.

59:11.466 --> 59:14.166
You'll be alright. We'll get you outta here.

59:16.666 --> 59:17.600
We gotta move.

59:20.653 --> 59:22.986
Radio Sully. I'm sure he's on his way.

59:23.007 --> 59:25.607
Uh, go on. Here we go. There we go.

59:25.627 --> 59:28.227
There you go, darlin'. We gotcha, we gotcha.

59:31.168 --> 59:34.034
Sully. Sully, come in.

59:41.675 --> 59:43.408
Sullivan, this is Beckett.

59:43.628 --> 59:44.828
Come in.

59:45.482 --> 59:46.582
Anything?

59:47.999 --> 59:50.066
Too deep in the maze.

59:52.257 --> 59:55.990
- Fuck.
- Sullivan. Do you read me? This is Beckett.

01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:26.289
Jesus Christ!

01:00:34.199 --> 01:00:35.132
Alright.

01:00:40.644 --> 01:00:43.311
- Uh, it's so slippery. Uh!
- OK.

01:00:46.436 --> 01:00:48.269
- Hang on.
- Wait here a minute.

01:00:55.362 --> 01:00:57.696
- Alright.
- What-what is it?

01:00:58.843 --> 01:01:01.510
- It's a cabin.
- Oh, thank God.

01:01:05.874 --> 01:01:07.607
OK, now, just lean on me.

01:01:12.774 --> 01:01:13.674
Oh...

01:01:19.857 --> 01:01:21.190
Here. Sit down here.

01:01:21.525 --> 01:01:22.558
There you go, honey.

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:24.078
- Ya got her?
- Yeah.

01:01:24.098 --> 01:01:25.598
Hey, easy, now.

01:01:26.118 --> 01:01:28.118
There, that's it.

01:01:35.063 --> 01:01:40.463
Rowan! Wait! Wait, God... damn it!

01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:46.805
See this?

01:01:46.825 --> 01:01:48.825
- Gall bladders.
- Paws.

01:01:50.509 --> 01:01:52.509
Oh, the big money.

01:02:00.867 --> 01:02:04.067
Who's that? Is that him? Is that Johnny?

01:02:06.442 --> 01:02:07.342
Nah.

01:02:09.468 --> 01:02:10.668
Get the hell outta here.

01:02:12.008 --> 01:02:13.508
Don't touch anything!

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:17.232
Let's go.

01:02:20.453 --> 01:02:21.920
C'mon, we gotta go.

01:02:22.039 --> 01:02:25.006
- What's wrong?
- We can't stay here.

01:02:25.947 --> 01:02:28.613
Still think those guys are worth savin'?

01:02:29.853 --> 01:02:30.887
Oh, my God.

01:02:32.584 --> 01:02:34.384
Goddamn savages.

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:37.219
C'mon.

01:02:38.113 --> 01:02:40.613
- Let's go.
- OK.

01:02:41.904 --> 01:02:43.671
Watch it. Watch yourself.

01:02:46.103 --> 01:02:48.203
Hey. Lean on me, there.

01:02:53.042 --> 01:02:54.142
I gotcha.

01:03:06.963 --> 01:03:08.396
There's your boy.

01:03:14.067 --> 01:03:16.234
- No, don't do that. Leave 'im...
- Fuck off!

01:03:16.254 --> 01:03:18.190
Leave 'im up there. We'll come back and get help.

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:22.074
You take 'im down now, the goddam
bear'll leave nothin' to bury.

01:03:24.424 --> 01:03:28.157
- I imagine you woulda liked that.
- Look, I'm sorry about that, OK?

01:03:30.692 --> 01:03:31.758
It's back!

01:03:32.098 --> 01:03:34.631
Douglas! What the hell you doin' out here, man?

01:03:34.651 --> 01:03:36.251
Fucking hell, Douglas.

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:39.057
Looks like your bear found Johnny.

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:43.052
Good God almighty!

01:03:44.716 --> 01:03:46.049
Lord, have mercy!

01:03:46.252 --> 01:03:48.585
Chewed his leg, right off.

01:03:48.632 --> 01:03:51.499
It wasn't the bear that killed him, though.
Lookee, there.

01:03:51.519 --> 01:03:53.019
He was shot.

01:03:53.039 --> 01:03:56.139
I had a bad feelin' when I saw
him hangin' out with them guys.

01:03:56.159 --> 01:03:58.159
You have anything to do with this, Douglas?

01:03:58.179 --> 01:03:59.879
With this? Hell, no!

01:04:01.165 --> 01:04:06.965
They came to me, first, and they was snoopin'
around for a guide and... I turned 'em down.

01:04:06.985 --> 01:04:09.785
- I knew what they was up to.
- What?

01:04:09.805 --> 01:04:12.605
I seen 'em down at the truck stop, all of 'em.

01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:14.225
What you talkin' about?

01:04:16.132 --> 01:04:19.799
- Why don't you ask your boss?
- My boss. Sully?

01:04:19.819 --> 01:04:22.719
You spend too much time huggin' trees, pardner.

01:04:23.339 --> 01:04:25.339
Johnny shoulda known better.

01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:27.959
I may be a lotta things, y'all, but...

01:04:29.075 --> 01:04:31.675
what these guys are up to is pure evil.

01:04:31.995 --> 01:04:35.095
You start messin' with evil, you
open up the door to the devil.

01:04:35.515 --> 01:04:37.815
Well, so we're in hell, now.

01:04:38.932 --> 01:04:40.832
What're you up to, over there?

01:04:40.852 --> 01:04:43.952
Kaley's hurt. She can't walk.
Gonna take your horse.

01:04:43.972 --> 01:04:47.072
- Is that right?
- That's right.

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:50.764
Well, listen, normally, I wouldn't mind
givin' y'all a ride on ol' Gus, but

01:04:50.785 --> 01:04:54.212
see, right now, we're huntin', and
we don't need no damn distractions.

01:04:54.232 --> 01:04:58.532
Well, you can keep on huntin'...
I just need ol' Gus.

01:04:58.552 --> 01:05:03.252
See, if I don't find that bear, before it
finds y'all... ain't gonna make it, anyway.

01:05:03.872 --> 01:05:07.372
- And it will hunt you. Trust me.
- That's a risk we'll take.

01:05:07.392 --> 01:05:09.992
Give the old man his horse back, Rowan.

01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:13.203
Give 'im the horse, Rowan.

01:05:18.512 --> 01:05:19.779
Come on, Gus.

01:05:20.399 --> 01:05:21.899
Y'all like bein' hunted?

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:26.119
Ain't a damn bit o' fun, believe me.

01:05:30.062 --> 01:05:32.529
I hope you know what you're doin'.

01:05:37.249 --> 01:05:38.582
Leaks more, we gotta carry her.

01:05:39.002 --> 01:05:40.902
Take my arm, let's carry ya.

01:05:40.922 --> 01:05:43.622
- OK, I got her.
- Gotcha.

01:05:43.942 --> 01:05:46.142
How come you never asked me what happened?

01:05:46.562 --> 01:05:49.762
What's there to know? Ya...
smuggled booze and shot a man.

01:05:49.782 --> 01:05:52.482
Alright! I got it.

01:05:52.902 --> 01:05:56.702
Let's just get outta here... and go our
separate ways, for good? How 'bout that?

01:05:56.722 --> 01:05:58.722
That's the best idea you've ever had.

01:05:58.742 --> 01:06:00.742
Uh, I don't feel too good.

01:06:00.762 --> 01:06:03.362
OK, I need to keep it elevated for awhile.

01:06:03.382 --> 01:06:06.582
Michelle says... Kaley needs the restroom.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:10.263
Oh, what? No, no.

01:06:10.284 --> 01:06:13.984
It's taken us two hours to go one mile. It's
double the amount of time it shoulda taken.

01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:15.904
We got no time.

01:06:15.924 --> 01:06:19.724
No, you're... I'm not bein' stubborn! You're
the one bein' stubborn. I know she's hurt.

01:06:20.944 --> 01:06:24.301
Alright, w... we're gonna wait here...
for a little while,

01:06:24.322 --> 01:06:28.764
but we gotta get outta here, way
before the sun comes up. OK?

01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:45.797
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

01:06:46.927 --> 01:06:48.527
Can you get some sleep?

01:06:49.748 --> 01:06:51.548
Did you really shoot a man?

01:06:55.407 --> 01:06:57.440
- Get some sleep.
- Please, Rowan.

01:06:58.061 --> 01:07:02.161
I need to know. Don't make it be for nothing.

01:07:03.181 --> 01:07:06.985
You know, the last time I came up here
was with my dad, in the dead of Winter.

01:07:07.006 --> 01:07:11.601
My mom was not doin' great.
She needed the operation.

01:07:12.621 --> 01:07:14.221
But we had nothing.

01:07:14.541 --> 01:07:18.941
All I knew was, may dad just...
he needed to be up here.

01:07:19.561 --> 01:07:23.661
It's, like, the only place in the
world, he felt, made any sense to him.

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.807
And the first night...

01:07:26.881 --> 01:07:30.876
I wake up and I hear this... weird sound, and

01:07:30.897 --> 01:07:34.401
so I poked my head outside the
tent and it's snowing, and...

01:07:35.901 --> 01:07:38.101
and I see him. He's got his back turned to me...

01:07:39.148 --> 01:07:42.281
and he's... sobbing.

01:07:43.409 --> 01:07:46.377
Dad was the strongest man I've
ever met, and could survive

01:07:46.398 --> 01:07:48.962
in the wilderness, with a
hunting knife, for weeks.

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:53.782
And there he was... cryin' his heart
out 'cause he couldn't save my mom.

01:07:56.635 --> 01:08:00.868
And that... uh... wrecked me.

01:08:00.888 --> 01:08:06.388
So, I went to Johnny Cadillac. He was the only
guy I knew who could get money, on the fly.

01:08:06.408 --> 01:08:11.308
I mean, he was harmless, I mean, he was
sellin' weed, to, you know, make ends meet.

01:08:11.328 --> 01:08:13.228
But his supplier was, the real deal.

01:08:13.248 --> 01:08:18.048
They were smuggling booze to, some of the
Indian towns, and they needed a guide.

01:08:18.068 --> 01:08:23.568
Um... the way I saw it, I didn't really
have a choice. So, I took the job.

01:08:23.587 --> 01:08:27.287
Um, easy enough. Everything went
smoothly, right up to the exchange.

01:08:27.308 --> 01:08:32.008
The, all of a sudden, we
get hit by State Troopers.

01:08:33.028 --> 01:08:35.928
And I found myself right in the
middle of a fuckin' shootout.

01:08:36.268 --> 01:08:37.435
So, what did you do?

01:08:37.456 --> 01:08:40.654
Well, I took the bag of money
and I ran off into the woods.

01:08:40.675 --> 01:08:45.075
I noticed there was a Trooper that'd...
been hit in the leg,

01:08:46.295 --> 01:08:50.795
crawlin' away, for his life, and one of
the smugglers, comin' up from behind him,

01:08:50.814 --> 01:08:52.814
just ready to put another one right in his head.

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:57.304
Jesus, one of those moments, when
you're just, like, what the f...

01:08:57.323 --> 01:09:00.424
How the hell did I get here, in the first place?

01:09:04.979 --> 01:09:09.879
So, as soon as I saw the guy
raise his gun, I just...

01:09:11.099 --> 01:09:13.099
well, I stopped and I shot him.

01:09:14.975 --> 01:09:16.709
I weirded everyone my way.

01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:21.004
Fifteen seconds cost me seven years.

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:25.424
- But, you saved a cop's life.
- I still killed a man.

01:09:26.044 --> 01:09:28.243
And I was the one holdin' the cash.

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:33.964
I remember handin' over that bag of money
was like... puttin' my mom in the grave.

01:09:36.099 --> 01:09:38.599
Why didn't you tell anyone?

01:09:38.618 --> 01:09:44.919
I don't really have a great history of... people
in this town believin' what I have to say.

01:09:47.127 --> 01:09:49.328
You could've told me.

01:09:54.881 --> 01:09:56.614
I'm sorry, Rowan.

01:09:57.234 --> 01:10:00.534
- I'm so sorry.
- It's OK.

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:04.630
Get some sleep.

01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:08.550
Michelle's probably freezin' out there.

01:10:37.741 --> 01:10:43.674
Listen, I was thinkin' maybe, uh... maybe
you and Michelle should just keep movin'.

01:10:44.494 --> 01:10:47.594
- I'll stay back, with Kaley, and...
- No.

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:54.247
This time, we're stickin' together.

01:10:57.324 --> 01:11:01.924
For better or for worse. We stick together.

01:11:19.881 --> 01:11:20.881
Whoa.

01:11:41.103 --> 01:11:43.836
Buddy, I think we're in for a long night.

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:07.613
- Hear that?
- Gotta give it to him. He's one hell of a hunter.

01:12:18.705 --> 01:12:21.072
- Jesus, Rowan, you alright?
 - Yeah.

01:12:24.903 --> 01:12:25.936
Douglas!

01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:27.903
Douglas!

01:12:30.754 --> 01:12:31.821
Holy hell!

01:12:37.102 --> 01:12:38.202
Beck!

01:12:46.174 --> 01:12:47.174
Oh, shit.

01:12:50.392 --> 01:12:52.259
Rowan?! Rowan!

01:12:53.138 --> 01:12:55.038
- Kaley!
- Kaley!

01:12:55.566 --> 01:12:56.466
Kaley!

01:12:58.696 --> 01:13:00.196
Oh, what happened?

01:13:00.367 --> 01:13:02.334
Douglas is dead. He's dead.

01:13:02.354 --> 01:13:05.154
Leave the tent. Leave everything.
We're gettin' the hell outta here.

01:13:05.374 --> 01:13:07.474
- I'm stayin' here.
- What?

01:13:07.494 --> 01:13:08.994
- You heard me.
- The hell, you are!

01:13:09.014 --> 01:13:12.014
- Trust me, I know what I'm doin'.
- Rowan, no. It's suicide.

01:13:12.434 --> 01:13:14.434
I'm gonna lead it in the other direction.

01:13:14.756 --> 01:13:17.723
- You take the girls down to the beach.
- What?! No!

01:13:17.743 --> 01:13:21.343
- You heard me. Come on.
- No, you know, I'll do it. OK?

01:13:21.363 --> 01:13:24.363
I'm faster, and what, you're stronger.
Carry Kaley on your back.

01:13:26.276 --> 01:13:27.409
Come on.

01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:31.750
There's five rounds left.

01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:33.770
There's one in the chamber.

01:13:34.079 --> 01:13:35.945
Make every shot count.

01:13:38.944 --> 01:13:41.877
- Asshole.
- Yeah, I know.

01:13:46.794 --> 01:13:49.661
It's not gonna be able to move
as fast as me, in the maze.

01:13:49.681 --> 01:13:51.681
Wait, what are-what are you doing?

01:13:51.701 --> 01:13:54.901
You're gonna play tag with it? It's crazy.

01:13:54.921 --> 01:13:59.221
Please.... it's our best shot.

01:14:12.456 --> 01:14:13.256
Go.

01:14:14.276 --> 01:14:17.076
Get outta here. Go!

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:00.303
How far?

01:15:00.723 --> 01:15:02.323
Two miles, maybe.

01:15:02.328 --> 01:15:04.695
I need-I need a break
because it's really painful.

01:15:04.714 --> 01:15:07.314
OK, OK, here. By this tree.

01:15:07.834 --> 01:15:08.934
Easy.

01:15:15.112 --> 01:15:17.912
I'm gonna have to take a look at this leg.

01:15:18.226 --> 01:15:21.393
Easy, now. Just gonna cut these off. Alright.

01:15:24.643 --> 01:15:25.776
Oh, God.

01:16:14.133 --> 01:16:15.333
Let's go.

01:16:29.081 --> 01:16:30.181
Oh, shit!

01:16:37.943 --> 01:16:39.143
Oh, fuck!

01:17:53.904 --> 01:17:54.937
Wait up.

01:18:01.698 --> 01:18:02.798
Rowan!

01:18:03.518 --> 01:18:04.718
Rowan!

01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:14.655
That's not Rowan!

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:49.280
Where the hell is he?

01:19:00.778 --> 01:19:01.878
Fuck!

01:20:08.639 --> 01:20:09.539
Hey!

01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:00.130
God.

01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:01.710
OK.

01:21:20.235 --> 01:21:21.935
I gotta put you down.

01:21:24.828 --> 01:21:27.261
- Where's Sully?
- He's here.

01:21:28.454 --> 01:21:30.687
Help me. Help me.

01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:52.063
Where's Rowan?

01:21:52.563 --> 01:21:55.630
Rowan's gone! Douglas is gone, too.

01:21:55.650 --> 01:21:58.450
And I oughtta leave your ass right here.

01:21:59.505 --> 01:22:02.305
- Sully!
- Alright! I took money!

01:22:02.325 --> 01:22:06.025
I turned the poachers loose. I didn't
know this shit was gonna go down.

01:22:06.045 --> 01:22:10.345
Son, I'm retiring... and I got fuckin' nothin'!

01:22:10.365 --> 01:22:13.765
- Sully.
- Behind you!

01:22:24.136 --> 01:22:25.036
Sully!

01:22:31.736 --> 01:22:32.869
Oh, my God!

01:22:38.324 --> 01:22:39.524
Rowan!

01:22:39.744 --> 01:22:41.744
Beckett, it's Rowan!

01:22:52.374 --> 01:22:53.574
Hey! Hey!

01:22:56.292 --> 01:22:58.092
Hey! Fuckin' quit!

01:23:08.849 --> 01:23:09.749
OK.

01:23:11.573 --> 01:23:13.706
Come on! Hey!

01:23:14.551 --> 01:23:16.351
Hey! Hey!

01:23:16.371 --> 01:23:18.571
Come on, come on, come on, come, on!

01:23:27.718 --> 01:23:28.918
C'mere fucker!

01:23:28.938 --> 01:23:30.138
Hey, hey hey!

01:23:30.767 --> 01:23:32.000
Here, here!

01:23:37.227 --> 01:23:38.660
Yeah, yeah! C'mon?!

01:23:58.396 --> 01:24:00.229
- Alright?
- OK.

01:24:00.449 --> 01:24:02.449
- Sully.
- He's gone.

01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:06.169
Come on, keep movin'. Let's get outta here.

01:24:06.502 --> 01:24:07.402
Here.

01:24:10.509 --> 01:24:11.642
Oh, my God!

01:24:12.118 --> 01:24:14.351
- Whoa!
- Pull!

01:24:14.371 --> 01:24:15.771
Move! Move!

01:24:15.791 --> 01:24:17.791
Buckle it!

01:24:20.546 --> 01:24:21.846
Beckett, hurry!

01:24:23.077 --> 01:24:24.210
Go, go, go!

01:24:45.612 --> 01:24:46.612
Michelle!

01:24:50.528 --> 01:24:51.428
Rowan!

01:24:51.448 --> 01:24:52.348
Shit!

01:25:11.854 --> 01:25:12.654
Go!

01:25:30.621 --> 01:25:32.188
Rowan, no!

01:25:58.625 --> 01:26:01.125
No! Rowan!

01:26:27.198 --> 01:26:28.098
Rowan.
