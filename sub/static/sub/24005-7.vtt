welcome back to The Forge.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.093
You've had five days
at your home forges

37:00.093 --> 37:02.804
to work on your
Polish karabelas.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.806
Ethan, how did it go for you?

37:04.806 --> 37:09.728
<i>- It's completely hand-forged.</i>
<i>It's made from 51-60.</i>

37:09.728 --> 37:13.440
<i>The handle is jatoba</i>
<i>and elk antler.</i>

37:13.440 --> 37:14.983
- All right.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.610
So, Liam, tell the judges
about your blade.

37:17.610 --> 37:21.197
<i>- My blade is</i>
<i>10-95 high-carbon steel.</i>

37:21.197 --> 37:24.784
<i>The cross guard, thumb ring,</i>
<i>and pommel pieces</i>

37:24.784 --> 37:28.663
<i>are Damascus</i>
<i>with a Byzantine chain guard.</i>

37:28.663 --> 37:30.457
I had a shop fire

37:30.457 --> 37:32.834
and took
a third-degree burn to the arm,

37:32.834 --> 37:34.878
so I'm happy
I'm presenting a sword.

37:34.878 --> 37:37.505
- Wow. We're glad you're okay.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.632
Well, bladesmiths,
your weapons will now be put

37:39.632 --> 37:41.301
through a series
of three tests.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.386
There will be a strength test,
a sharpness test,

37:43.386 --> 37:45.346

To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon will do,

37:54.773 --> 37:56.149
I will take your weapon

37:56.149 --> 37:57.317

slashes and thrusts
