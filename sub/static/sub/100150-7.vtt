00:07.174 --> 00:09.093
(clicking,
soft clattering)

00:12.596 --> 00:14.724
BELL:
You don't have to do this.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.934
You can leave right now.

00:16.976 --> 00:18.978
Door's wide open.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.941
You will not be judged.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.696
Set the timer for 25 minutes.

00:28.738 --> 00:30.406
Enough time for you to get clear

00:30.448 --> 00:31.824
without anyone finding
the parcel.

00:31.866 --> 00:33.701
Mm-hmm.

00:33.743 --> 00:36.746
Some of you will be captured.

00:36.787 --> 00:39.707
I know you know
what that means.

00:39.790 --> 00:43.794
Most we can promise is to fight
every day for your release.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.713
That's some beautiful shoes
you just cobbled together.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.339
(laughs softly)

00:49.508 --> 00:52.386
Your families will be cared for.

00:52.428 --> 00:54.930
We don't forget
what our soldiers have given

00:54.972 --> 00:56.515
to the struggle.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.392
We do this

00:58.434 --> 01:01.729
because we want the life...

01:01.771 --> 01:04.315
our people have never had
before.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.530
Brother Benjamin?

01:13.574 --> 01:15.117
You sure you're ready?

01:17.036 --> 01:18.579
LEON:
Yeah, he's ready.

01:18.621 --> 01:21.415
Let the young man speak
for himself, Leon.

01:23.042 --> 01:25.044
I'm ready.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.005
All right, then.

01:34.804 --> 01:37.765
Let's tear down
the emperor's house.

CAMPBELL:
America's war in Vietnam will be

03:01.307 --> 03:02.558
quickly and easily won.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.936
The U.S. of the Alt-World

03:05.978 --> 03:08.898
somehow managed
to become a global superpower.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.900
They maintain the most
technologically-advanced

03:10.941 --> 03:13.235
fighting force
that world has ever seen.

03:13.277 --> 03:16.113
The Vietnamese are
a primitive race.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.407
They're fighting with rifles
and land mines.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.992
There's no contest.

03:25.956 --> 03:29.919
Tell me, do they still
teach ancient history

03:29.960 --> 03:31.712
at Junkerschule, Campbell?

03:31.754 --> 03:35.299
They teach Aryan history, sir.

03:35.341 --> 03:38.928
Well, the Romans called Hannibal
a primitive

03:38.969 --> 03:43.140
right up until he marched
his army all the way from Africa

03:43.182 --> 03:45.184
on elephants and crushed them.

03:47.144 --> 03:50.981
In war, technology and wealth
are no guarantee of victory.

03:51.023 --> 03:53.734
What matters is the will to win.

04:02.952 --> 04:05.120
CAMPBELL:
Thomas seems
to be progressing well.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.915
He'll get a good posting,
close to the action.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.378
I want his status updated
regularly.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.588
When he's assigned to a company,

04:14.630 --> 04:16.632
when he goes on leave,
everything.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.014
(door opens)

04:25.766 --> 04:27.226
(door closes)

04:27.267 --> 04:28.727
(clears throat)

04:28.769 --> 04:31.522
We have prepared
your confession.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.276
For your signature.

04:46.370 --> 04:50.207
To you,
this is a list of crimes.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.877
To me,

04:53.919 --> 04:56.672
this is a list of acts
in the service of the Emperor.

04:56.714 --> 04:59.174
Perhaps he will see it that way

04:59.216 --> 05:03.470
when you arrive in Tokyo
for your court-martial.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.472
Shall I tell you

05:05.514 --> 05:09.059
what else I have done
to add it to your list?

05:10.519 --> 05:12.521
If you like.

05:14.398 --> 05:17.401
I have given two
of my sons' lives.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.239
I am sorry.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.659
You never spoke of them.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.786
Jun'ya

05:27.828 --> 05:30.622
and Kenta were their names.

05:32.750 --> 05:35.878
I have kept their pictures
in my uniform,

05:35.919 --> 05:37.921
close to my heart.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.259
I am grateful
that they were able

05:42.301 --> 05:44.636
to give their lives
for the Empire.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.183
If we surrender this territory,

05:49.224 --> 05:52.144
their deaths will have been
for nothing.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.023
I will not accept that.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.026
(panting)

06:00.694 --> 06:02.696
You have a son.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.074
I have two sons.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.534
They are alive?

06:07.576 --> 06:09.578
Yes.

06:09.620 --> 06:13.582
So you do not know what it is
to lose a child.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.172
No.

06:20.214 --> 06:23.592
For you, our cause was a choice.

06:23.634 --> 06:28.055
For me, there is no going back.

06:47.407 --> 06:52.037
"The war is never lost
until the last man dies."

06:52.079 --> 06:55.374
That is my confession.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.669
Take it to the Emperor,

06:58.710 --> 07:00.712
and he will pardon me.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.558
(door opens)

07:23.735 --> 07:26.572
Thanks for doing this, Richie.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.324
Well, it's not much, but it's
safe and out of the way.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.909
Electricity.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.787
We jerry-rigged the wiring
into the Reich's power grid.

07:33.829 --> 07:35.247
It's cold in here.

07:35.289 --> 07:39.501
Chimney works.
There's a bit of kindling there.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.378
JULIANA:
Better draw the curtains.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.339
Oh, the Reich hardly bothers to
patrol anything north of 116th.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.384
They took Harlem off the map
back in '49.

07:47.426 --> 07:49.970
-They tried.
-RICHIE: Canned goods,

07:50.012 --> 07:52.723
Sterno stove kit,
pack of smokes, pint of rye.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.350
I'll be back tomorrow
with more of what you'll need.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.394
JULIANA:
Thank you.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.439
(door opens, closes)

08:00.480 --> 08:02.399
(exhales)

08:02.441 --> 08:04.776
A lot of ghosts in this place.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.779
Let's hope they don't
mind uninvited guests.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.535
JULIANA:
Everything's still here.

08:13.577 --> 08:16.955
WYATT:
They wouldn't have had time
to gather their things.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.041
JULIANA:
Nowhere to go.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.795
Jesus, look at the bloodstains.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.256
These people put up a fight.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.261
Here they are.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.892
WYATT:
"Lucille and Warren Huggins.

08:36.934 --> 08:39.770
"Married June 19, 1933,

08:39.811 --> 08:43.106
at the Broadway African
Methodist Episcopal Church."

08:45.901 --> 08:48.362
I want to think they'd be happy

08:48.403 --> 08:51.198
that we're here...

08:51.240 --> 08:54.368
in their home.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.495
Yeah.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.538
I'd want to think so, too.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.171
-Ma'am?
-Hmm?

09:06.213 --> 09:08.090
She's ten minutes early, but--
Mrs. Himmler.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.133
Please, show her in.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.767
Margarete.
Oh, what lovely flowers.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.352
Please, let...

09:20.394 --> 09:22.729
Nein. They have to be
handled properly.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.023
Fraulein, a vase.

09:27.359 --> 09:31.697
Gomphrena, false goat's beard,
amaranth.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.865
These are beautiful.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.493
Oh, fresh flowers...
bloom once, then die.

09:36.576 --> 09:40.080
Dried flowers... are forever.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.665
I still have my wedding bouquet.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.417
Hmm.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.712
Sealed inside
an airtight bell jar.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.547
-Oh, that's so special.
-Mm.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.550
A Reich wife must work
always in the service

09:51.591 --> 09:55.012
of her husband's destiny,
or... or else.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.889
Yes.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.975
Which is why
I invited you here today.

10:00.017 --> 10:03.437
Please, won't you join me?

10:13.739 --> 10:15.907
I know how you must see me,
Margarete.

10:15.949 --> 10:19.494
What can I say?

10:19.536 --> 10:22.706
Please, be honest.

10:22.748 --> 10:25.542
It's not just me, I'm afraid.

10:25.584 --> 10:29.004
All of Berlin,
everyone knows the truth

10:29.046 --> 10:33.133
of your year
in the Neutral Zone.

10:33.175 --> 10:37.095
And my husband.
I know John can seem aloof.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.347
Or arrogant.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.182
No, they misunderstand him.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.059
He's quiet.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.727
-That's all.
-Be that as it may,

10:43.769 --> 10:47.356
I don't have to tell you
what becomes of the children

10:47.397 --> 10:51.902
once the father
comes under suspicion.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.154
What do I have to do
to earn my way back

10:54.196 --> 10:55.197
into the good graces of...

10:55.238 --> 10:57.699
-My husband.
-And you.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.952
I want the trust of the Reich.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.954
And the freedom that
comes with that.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.582
I want that freedom
for my daughters, too.

11:08.335 --> 11:12.130
Some people think I'm a cold,
brittle old woman.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.883
I don't believe that.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.221
The eyes speak what the mouth
doesn't dare say.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.264
I don't mind.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.893
What they don't realize is that

11:24.935 --> 11:27.687
I am a caring person, in here.

11:30.273 --> 11:33.318
You have to assume the role
of a proper

11:33.360 --> 11:36.905
-treusorgende Ehefrau
to your husband.
-...faithful wife...

11:36.947 --> 11:38.782
Well, I'm doing that.

11:38.824 --> 11:41.535
Oh, you've done that here,
today.

11:41.576 --> 11:44.413
Now you must show the world.

11:44.454 --> 11:48.750
Show the world you have come
home to National Socialism,

11:48.792 --> 11:52.921
not in body,
but in deiner Seele...

11:52.963 --> 11:55.132
in your soul.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.473
HELEN:
Gomprhena.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.183
Sounds like a venereal disease.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.436
Incurable strain.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.356
Get Billy Turner on the phone.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.692
I'm going to make
a public appearance.

12:18.029 --> 12:22.659
GABRIELA:
There is no holiday
like Reichsgiving, and so,

12:22.701 --> 12:26.288
I have a very special guest
for you this morning, ladies.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.956
A personal friend of mine
who has never

12:27.998 --> 12:29.499
appeared on the show before,

12:29.541 --> 12:32.335
to share her own
Reichsgiving recipes.

12:32.377 --> 12:37.549
Die Ehefrau des Reichsmarschall
Helen Smith.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.968
(cheers and applause)

12:42.679 --> 12:44.723
You weren't gonna tell us?

12:44.764 --> 12:49.186
My secretary runs in telling me
Helen Smith is on the TV.

12:49.227 --> 12:53.356
HELEN:
This Kasespatzle recipe is
a tradition in our house.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.234
I make it with my daughters
this time every October.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.778
GABRIELA:
Ah... Smells delicious.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.823
What is your secret ingredient,
Helen?

13:01.865 --> 13:03.200
Uh, bacon fat

13:03.241 --> 13:04.618
-and a stick of butter.
-(laughter)

13:04.659 --> 13:06.244
-Ah.
-Don't ask about the calories.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.705
I promise, no calorie talk.

13:08.747 --> 13:11.708
While that Spatzle is baking,
it's time for some girl talk.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.210
Oh, good.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.544
Now, you have been married

13:14.586 --> 13:16.546
to Reichsmarschall
John Smith for...

13:16.588 --> 13:18.131
-20 years.
-(applause)

13:18.173 --> 13:19.216
And how the time has flown.

13:19.257 --> 13:22.219
GABRIELA:
So, what is your secret

13:22.260 --> 13:23.845
to a happy marriage?

13:23.887 --> 13:24.846
How do you manage

13:24.888 --> 13:26.806
to keep the fire burning?

13:26.848 --> 13:29.184
I can answer that in one word.

13:29.226 --> 13:32.229
A word that we can use
on Reich TV?

13:32.270 --> 13:34.314
(chuckles)
I think we can use it. Yes.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.399
Honesty.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.360
(applause)

13:38.401 --> 13:41.238
HELEN:
That, to me, is the foundation

13:41.279 --> 13:43.073
of a successful marriage.

13:43.114 --> 13:46.618
(applause)

13:46.660 --> 13:50.622
Helen, think back
to your first Reichsgiving,

13:50.664 --> 13:54.709
the first moment you first gave
thanks for National Socialism.

13:54.751 --> 13:58.630
Um, hmm...

13:58.672 --> 14:02.592
Oh, um, it would be
February, '46,

14:02.634 --> 14:04.761
just after The Liberation.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.054
John was still in the--

14:06.096 --> 14:07.973
(clears throat)

14:08.014 --> 14:10.517
John was in the U.S. Army.

14:10.559 --> 14:13.687
Um, we had been posted
to Fort Monmouth,

14:13.728 --> 14:17.232
and we had just had our son.

14:17.274 --> 14:21.945
Thomas was, um,
he was just a baby.

14:21.987 --> 14:25.824
GABRIELA:
It's all right. Take a moment.

14:27.576 --> 14:31.454
No, no, I...
I'd like to talk about it.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.589
We hadn't eaten in days.

14:40.630 --> 14:44.134
I thought that my baby was
going to starve...

14:44.175 --> 14:46.886
in my arms.

14:46.928 --> 14:50.140
A man, a Reich colonel,
he came to our door.

14:50.181 --> 14:54.227
He brought us milk, bread,
cheese, meat.

14:54.269 --> 14:58.148
It was all airlifted in
by the Reich in an act of mercy.

14:58.189 --> 15:01.026
And my baby...

15:01.067 --> 15:03.862
he finally stopped crying.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.698
GABRIELA:
From that day forward,

15:06.740 --> 15:10.160
thanks to that spirit of mercy,

15:10.201 --> 15:13.663
there has never again been
hunger in the Reich.

15:13.705 --> 15:17.042
(applause)

15:17.083 --> 15:18.835
And who else was there
that night?

15:21.504 --> 15:23.882
Um, it--

15:23.923 --> 15:26.176
It was...

15:26.217 --> 15:31.264
Uh, well... well, it was
just-just us, our family.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.391
GABRIELA:
As it should be.

15:35.060 --> 15:39.064
John, myself and Thomas,
and...

15:39.105 --> 15:41.775
We put the past behind us.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.235
(applause)

15:44.277 --> 15:47.197
Thanks, Helen.

15:47.238 --> 15:51.076
We would love to have you back
on the show again, any time.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.286
(chuckles) Yes, yes.
I-I would like that.

15:53.328 --> 15:54.621
-Oh.
-(cheering)

15:54.663 --> 15:56.706
HELEN:
Thank you.

16:02.420 --> 16:06.049
If you don't mind, I-I got some,
uh, documents I want to sign.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.093
Of course.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.307
(seagulls squawking)

16:28.029 --> 16:30.448
(indistinct chatter)

16:30.490 --> 16:32.492
(ship's horn blares)

16:40.709 --> 16:42.210
This is a list of drop spots.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.838
Make sure your contact
identifies himself.

16:44.879 --> 16:48.717
Letters of transit to Salinas,
meticulously prepared.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.468
What if I get pulled over?

16:50.510 --> 16:53.388
They might toss a few shoeboxes
from the back to harass you.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.141
Stay cool, payload's up front.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.852
But if they get too close,

16:58.893 --> 17:00.729
you've got the tripwire.

17:00.770 --> 17:04.774
Remember:
no masters but ourselves.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.819
Stay alive, brother.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.946
And you.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.570
Well done.
Your Friend, Margarete.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.238
(knock on door)

18:03.958 --> 18:07.045
Your, uh... appearance today

18:07.086 --> 18:10.340
certainly got a lot
of attention.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.091
So it seems.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.929
I had no idea.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.640
I had Billy Turner arrange it.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.850
Ah.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.394
You've never done anything
like that before.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.857
I thought it was important
I show my allegiance.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.236
To who?

18:31.277 --> 18:33.988
Berlin.

18:34.030 --> 18:37.617
You. Me.

18:44.791 --> 18:49.045
You came to this
by yourself or...

18:49.087 --> 18:51.047
No.

18:51.089 --> 18:53.508
No. Margarete was here.

18:56.010 --> 18:59.514
Why didn't you consult with me?

19:01.349 --> 19:04.269
I have to clear my name, John.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.895
For the girls' sake,
if nothing else.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.231
And only I can do that.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.400
They all know the truth
about my year away.

19:10.441 --> 19:13.152
Right.

19:14.779 --> 19:18.074
I'd have thought
you would've been proud of me.

19:18.116 --> 19:21.953
Well, you could've made it
worse, Helen.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.747
I mean, you...

19:24.789 --> 19:26.624
you do know
how close you came, right?

19:26.666 --> 19:29.002
On Reich television?

19:29.043 --> 19:33.172
That woman put me on the spot
with her question.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.591
It all came rushing back.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.260
I haven't even thought
about it in--

19:39.345 --> 19:42.724
But I handled it, didn't I?

19:48.563 --> 19:50.273
You did fine.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.777
Do you ever think
about him, John?

19:56.571 --> 19:58.781
About Daniel?

20:00.742 --> 20:02.744
No.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.665
(door opens, closes)

20:09.959 --> 20:11.294
LEON:
Easy now. Slow.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.304
Shut the box.

20:21.346 --> 20:24.307
What'd I teach you?

20:24.349 --> 20:26.184
Go on, sit down.

20:35.944 --> 20:39.030
Get out of the boat.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.157
You're too heavy, that's all.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.076
I'm not scared.

20:43.117 --> 20:46.287
I'm not going to row this tub
across the bay with you in it.

20:46.329 --> 20:47.789
So go on.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.041
Get out.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.215
Get that bow line
and cast me off.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.469
Be careful, Leon.

21:08.101 --> 21:12.855
Tell the others...
we eat whale tonight.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.992
(indistinct chatter)

21:26.452 --> 21:28.705
HENRY:
The Eugenics midterm is
going to be a bear.

21:28.746 --> 21:31.165
JENNIFER:
Oh, God, how I hate Eugenics.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.834
What if it's all bullshit?

21:32.875 --> 21:34.002
It's science, Jennifer.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.754
That lab report we did,

21:36.796 --> 21:38.381
measuring the intelligence
of the races

21:38.423 --> 21:40.717
by filling skulls with birdseed?

21:40.758 --> 21:42.427
Think about it, Henry.

21:42.468 --> 21:45.680
My skull is half the size
of Howie Phipps'.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.515
So is everyone's.
His head is huge.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.142
And he's dumb as a bag
of cement.

21:50.685 --> 21:52.103
I don't want to think about it.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.730
I just want to pass Eugenics

21:53.771 --> 21:56.482
and never have to think
about Eugenics again.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.528
I'm sorry, Henry.

22:00.570 --> 22:04.365
You just want to get good marks,
and I'm not really helping.

22:04.407 --> 22:07.827
Maybe you deserve a better
study partner, like Gretchen.

22:07.869 --> 22:12.498
I mean, I guess I could ask her.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.501
She did win
Most Aryan Girl and all.

22:15.543 --> 22:18.129
But she bores me.

22:18.171 --> 22:20.757
You don't.

22:20.798 --> 22:24.385
You're the least boring person
I've ever met.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.846
Everything is better
when you're around.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.908
JENNIFER:
Oh, God.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.785
Gerhardt's.

22:48.826 --> 22:52.288
Mom's dragging us girls there
for new winter wardrobes.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.540
Isn't that awful?

22:54.582 --> 22:59.962
HENRY (over mic):
I don't know
if it's awful, but...

23:02.340 --> 23:06.302
I think we should
get back to studying?

23:06.344 --> 23:07.887
(mic crackles)

23:07.929 --> 23:09.514
HENRY:
Hey, do you want to go

23:09.555 --> 23:10.932
trick-or-treating with me
on Halloween?

23:10.973 --> 23:12.141
JENNIFER:
I usually take Amy.

23:12.183 --> 23:14.143
Only thing I know for sure is,

23:14.185 --> 23:16.479
Mom will be wearing
her Helen Smith mask.

23:16.521 --> 23:19.190
She's back to playing
the perfect Reich wife.

23:19.232 --> 23:20.775
You know that cooking show
she did?

23:20.817 --> 23:22.485
But it's all an act.

23:22.527 --> 23:25.446
My parents are at the top
of the Nazi Party.

23:25.488 --> 23:28.825
They're both dying inside.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.368
My mom promised
to help me get back

23:30.409 --> 23:32.120
to the Neutral Zone someday,
and I don't want to wait.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.996
Jennifer, keep your voice low.

23:37.583 --> 23:40.211
Shouldn't I walk you home?

23:45.258 --> 23:47.051
HENRY (on recording):
Do you want to go
trick-or-treating with me

23:47.093 --> 23:48.970
-on Halloween?
-JENNIFER: I usually take Amy.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.180
-Did we get it?
-We got some of it.

23:51.222 --> 23:54.058
...Mom will be wearing
her Helen Smith mask.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.102
(tape fast-forwards)

23:58.396 --> 24:01.357
She's back to playing
the perfect Reich wife.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.109
You know that cooking show
she did?

24:03.151 --> 24:05.486
But it's all an act.

24:05.528 --> 24:07.738
(tape rewinds)

24:07.780 --> 24:09.365
(tape player clicks)

24:09.407 --> 24:11.993
JENNIFER:
Only thing I know for sure is,

24:12.034 --> 24:14.495
Mom will be wearing
her Helen Smith mask.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.082
I don't like involving the kids.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.917
BELLOWS:
Kids see.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.794
Kids hear, kids talk.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.421
You know,
mistresses are good, too.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.423
-Smith have one?
-Nah, he's too careful.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.300
All right, well,
we build a case file

24:27.341 --> 24:29.969
on the whole family, till there
are no more surprises.

24:30.011 --> 24:33.139
-Then we can move.
-Okay. Quiet.

24:33.181 --> 24:35.099
JENNIFER:
My mom promised
to help me get back

24:35.141 --> 24:37.018
to the Neutral Zone someday,
and I don't want to wait.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.436
HENRY:
Jennifer, keep your voice...

24:38.477 --> 24:39.854
RICHIE:
The Reichsmarschall's daughter

24:39.896 --> 24:41.689
wants to run off to the Zone.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.858
Right, so we offer to help
get her across the border,

24:43.900 --> 24:45.651
and then she accepts our offer.

24:45.693 --> 24:47.653
-WYATT: Then what?
-We take her.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.447
BELLOWS:
We control her,

24:49.488 --> 24:51.073
we control Smith.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.659
I don't want to blackmail Smith,
I want to kill him.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.913
Wind the tape back.

24:56.954 --> 24:58.831
Where she talks
about going shopping.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.670
JENNIFER:
Gerhardt's.

25:04.712 --> 25:08.007
Mom's dragging us girls there
for new winter wardrobes.

25:09.342 --> 25:10.760
Gerhardt's.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.512
Helen Smith will be
out in public.

25:14.764 --> 25:16.390
Forget the girl.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.434
We're staying on plan.

25:23.898 --> 25:27.777
Is it a good book, Childan?

25:27.818 --> 25:33.199
Well, it was a 1903
first edition until...

25:33.241 --> 25:35.201
-Oh, dear.
-Yeah.

25:35.243 --> 25:38.120
I figured I might as well
get some use out of it.

25:38.162 --> 25:40.915
These books were always
too precious to read before.

25:40.957 --> 25:44.210
What's it about?

25:44.252 --> 25:49.423
Uh, it's about a sled dog
in the Yukon.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.467
Ah. Dog story.

25:51.509 --> 25:54.011
(chuckles)
Yeah.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.639
(clears throat)
Buck, the dog, he, uh...

25:56.681 --> 25:59.642
-he starts out as a family pet.
-That's nice.

25:59.684 --> 26:02.853
But he's forced to shed
the veneer of civilization

26:02.895 --> 26:07.400
and return
to his primordial instincts.

26:07.441 --> 26:10.027
I'd like to read that book.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.154
I respect animals.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.156
They know no shame.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.492
They live for today.

26:16.534 --> 26:19.578
I have something for you.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.635
I repaired it while you slept.

26:39.557 --> 26:42.351
Using the kintsugi method,

26:42.393 --> 26:44.979
lacquer mixed
with powdered gold.

26:45.021 --> 26:47.356
Oh, Yukiko.

26:47.398 --> 26:48.983
I know you can't
sell it anymore,

26:49.025 --> 26:52.987
but the anemones were
too pretty to throw away.

26:53.029 --> 26:57.033
No, it's-it's wabi-sabi,
you know.

26:57.074 --> 27:01.245
Nothing lasts, nothing's
finished, nothing's perfect.

27:20.598 --> 27:22.558
(door bell jingles)

27:22.600 --> 27:24.435
-A customer.
-No.

27:24.477 --> 27:27.271
It... Just, it doesn't matter.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.148
-(laughs)
-Don't go. Don't go.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.192
We need the business.

27:43.037 --> 27:45.748
Officers.

27:45.790 --> 27:47.625
Thank goodness.
Have you found him?

27:47.666 --> 27:50.169
We are here
to take Robert Childan

27:50.211 --> 27:51.712
to headquarters for questioning.

27:51.754 --> 27:55.883
Mr. Childan has been missing
since the auction.

27:55.925 --> 27:58.761
We are relying
on the police to find him.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.724
NISHIDA:
Two bowls.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.520
One for me and one for customer.

28:09.897 --> 28:12.149
Childan is here. Find him.

28:20.157 --> 28:21.742
YUKIKO:
He's not here.

28:21.784 --> 28:23.494
You're wasting your time.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.631
Leave him alone!
He did nothing wrong!

28:35.673 --> 28:38.008
-Shh... I'll be
all right, Yukiko.
-Childan!

28:38.050 --> 28:39.385
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.

28:39.427 --> 28:42.555
I know who to talk to.
Don't worry.

28:42.596 --> 28:44.432
No-- I'll be back, Yukiko.

28:44.473 --> 28:47.226
(door opens, bell jingles)

28:47.268 --> 28:48.477
(blues music playing softly)

28:48.519 --> 28:50.187
WYATT:
Can you imagine the movies

28:50.229 --> 28:52.440
Raunchy Richie
used this stuff for?

28:52.481 --> 28:55.192
-I'd rather not. Thank you.
-(chuckles)

28:55.234 --> 28:57.653
(Wyatt exhales)

28:57.695 --> 29:01.699
Um, I'm not sure if this kit
is gonna get us past security.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.576
JULIANA:
Yeah, this stuff is cheap.

29:07.371 --> 29:08.706
It's like greasepaint.

29:15.296 --> 29:17.131
Consider the source, you know?

29:17.173 --> 29:20.259
(chuckles)

29:20.301 --> 29:22.386
JULIANA:
Yeah. Hmm.

29:32.605 --> 29:35.649
The wigs, I don't know.

29:35.691 --> 29:38.068
Hmm.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.905
My God, the furs are so...

29:42.781 --> 29:44.700
Just think of the type of woman
who moves

29:44.742 --> 29:46.744
-in Helen Smith's orbit.
-A lady of the Reich.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.287
That's right.

29:48.329 --> 29:51.582
A Park Avenue matron.

29:51.624 --> 29:53.292
She looks right past security.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.628
Well, they're nothing.
It's her world.

29:55.669 --> 30:01.258
They don't notice the lipstick,
the wig.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.636
They only see the gate.

30:03.677 --> 30:07.264
Well, the right kind of woman,
she could get right up close.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.766
For how long? I don't know.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.185
I'd need less than a minute.

30:11.227 --> 30:13.187
But it has to be...

30:13.229 --> 30:15.189
(tongue clicks)
I mean, it has to hold up.

30:15.231 --> 30:16.899
You-- not just to get in, but...

30:16.941 --> 30:20.361
To get me out. I know.

30:22.446 --> 30:24.990
All right.

30:25.032 --> 30:28.118
Your turn.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.120
-Huh?
-Mm-hmm.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.206
-Me?
-You up to it?

30:32.248 --> 30:34.208
(scoffs)

30:34.250 --> 30:36.502
Sure, I've been playing
a part for 20 years.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.629
Yeah, I know you have.

30:38.671 --> 30:40.965
Now you have to play
another one.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.800
Let us see.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.843
(sighs)

30:46.887 --> 30:49.098
Imagine, instead of becoming--

30:49.139 --> 30:51.475
Can you hold that front?

30:51.517 --> 30:54.311
...becoming this Wyatt Price,

30:54.353 --> 30:56.313
you became a different man.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.357
Hmm, I'd rather not.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.781
You believe what you're told.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.783
You put in your time.

31:07.825 --> 31:09.952
Take what you're given.

31:09.994 --> 31:11.996
Come on.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.039
(clears throat)

31:16.458 --> 31:19.461
Try not to think about
how the hell you got here.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.604
Well?

31:36.645 --> 31:38.647
What do you see?

31:42.735 --> 31:45.154
My father.

31:46.196 --> 31:48.449
He worked in a lead mine.

31:50.909 --> 31:55.539
I could smell the dust off him
when he came home from work.

31:58.125 --> 32:01.128
You know,
it'd be easy to be this man.

32:01.170 --> 32:03.339
You just have to give up.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.431
(brakes squeaking)

32:28.656 --> 32:31.492
(indistinct chatter)

32:39.083 --> 32:42.252
Kido Taisa,
you're a rational man.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.672
I'm sure you can see
that I had no possible motive

32:44.713 --> 32:46.465
to collaborate
with these terrorists.

32:46.507 --> 32:49.635
-I know.
-You know?

32:49.677 --> 32:52.930
-Well, then, why...
-You were their hostage,
were you not?

32:52.971 --> 32:54.848
Yes.

32:56.725 --> 32:59.311
(clicking)

32:59.353 --> 33:02.189
KIDO:
Tell me about them.

33:02.231 --> 33:04.316
CHILDAN:
I don't know
where they are now.

33:09.154 --> 33:12.700
They were, uh... they were
holed up in a warehouse.

33:12.741 --> 33:15.703
We discovered the warehouse
and searched it after they left.

33:15.744 --> 33:19.248
I'm not interested in
where they are.

33:19.289 --> 33:21.333
I want to know who they are.

33:21.375 --> 33:23.210
These people...

33:23.252 --> 33:26.964
We have file cabinets
full of intelligence on the BCR.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.675
And we still do not know
our enemy.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.929
When these Negroes captured me,

33:33.971 --> 33:36.181
I was, uh...

33:36.223 --> 33:38.517
I was terrified.

33:38.559 --> 33:40.269
I thought they were savages.

33:40.310 --> 33:42.312
And now?

33:44.314 --> 33:46.650
They're...

33:46.692 --> 33:49.069
shrewder... than I thought.

33:51.071 --> 33:53.031
Still savages. All of the...

33:53.073 --> 33:55.659
the wildness...

33:55.701 --> 33:58.120
that the Japanese
refined out of us...

33:58.162 --> 34:00.706
these Negroes, they...

34:00.748 --> 34:02.958
they never let that go.

34:07.337 --> 34:09.298
I have come to see that
as a part

34:09.339 --> 34:11.592
of the character
of this country.

34:14.428 --> 34:15.929
Perhaps this territory is like

34:15.971 --> 34:18.724
a wild horse or dog
that needs to be set free.

34:20.768 --> 34:22.728
Or put down.

34:22.770 --> 34:24.730
Then put it down,

34:24.772 --> 34:27.399
Chief Inspector.

34:27.441 --> 34:29.610
You can end it.

34:29.651 --> 34:31.820
But only if your will
to hold this territory

34:31.862 --> 34:33.906
is greater than theirs.

34:39.828 --> 34:43.832
CHILDAN:
Equiano, Bell, Elijah, Benjy.

34:43.874 --> 34:45.876
They were dishwashers.

34:45.918 --> 34:47.961
Menial laborers.

34:49.004 --> 34:51.924
Poets, artists.

34:51.965 --> 34:54.134
And that room
they kept me locked in,

34:54.176 --> 34:56.386
I could hear them talking.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.972
Their music,
the smell of their food.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.808
And the woman, Bell...

35:00.849 --> 35:02.851
she talked about their history.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.938
The Klan, the Reich,

35:05.979 --> 35:08.816
the Japanese. To them...

35:08.857 --> 35:10.651
you're just this week's enemy.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.987
They've been fighting
for 400 years.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.198
And they'll fight for 400 more.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.784
I think that's what scares me
the most about them.

35:18.826 --> 35:20.994
(distant explosion, shouts)

35:22.120 --> 35:24.957
(whoops, laughs)

35:24.998 --> 35:26.542

35:26.583 --> 35:28.001

35:32.256 --> 35:34.174
(explosion)

35:34.216 --> 35:35.384
(people screaming)

35:35.425 --> 35:37.094
Take that!

35:37.135 --> 35:38.887
-Yes!
-(laughing)

35:38.929 --> 35:41.890
Please come away
from the window.

35:41.932 --> 35:43.100
(Crown Princess screams)

35:44.977 --> 35:47.187
(distant shouting, explosions)

35:51.483 --> 35:55.279
-(explosions, screaming)
-Get out of here. Go home.

35:57.322 --> 35:58.866
(panicked chatter)

35:58.907 --> 36:00.450
(distant explosion)

36:00.492 --> 36:02.494

36:16.425 --> 36:19.303
(faint radio chatter)

36:19.344 --> 36:21.346
(sirens wailing)

36:31.481 --> 36:34.401
Admiral, we count
20 explosions across the city.

36:34.443 --> 36:35.903
Not just San Francisco.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.530
They've demolished
key infrastructure

36:38.572 --> 36:40.198
up and down the coast.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.492
San Diego, Salinas and
Long Beach have also been hit.

36:47.748 --> 36:50.042
INOKUCHI:
We have severely
underestimated our enemy.

36:50.083 --> 36:53.545
Your "army" failed, Saito.

36:53.587 --> 36:55.923
Now they are starving us
of fuel.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.966
NISHIDA:
Chief Inspector.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.596
You would dare blame the army?

37:02.638 --> 37:05.933
Yamori was right.
Our weakness allowed

37:05.974 --> 37:08.810
-the BCR to grow strong.
-Yamori killed
the one chance we had

37:08.852 --> 37:11.855
for cease-fire and now...
we have war.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.316
DJ EVANGELINE (on radio):
DJ Evangeline coming to you

37:14.358 --> 37:16.318
live from from Resistance Radio
with breaking news

37:16.360 --> 37:17.945
from the JPS.

37:17.986 --> 37:20.197
BELL:
I speak for
the Oakland Battalion

37:20.238 --> 37:22.366
of the Black Communist
Rebellion.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.409
We claim responsibility
for today's attacks

37:24.451 --> 37:26.495
on the vital services,

37:26.536 --> 37:29.373
Command and Control
and oil infrastructure

37:29.414 --> 37:31.750
of the Japanese occupiers.

37:31.792 --> 37:33.752
We seek an autonomous territory

37:33.794 --> 37:36.046
for black people
on the West Coast.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.297
And we will never quit.

37:37.339 --> 37:40.801
And the Empire's oil
will not flow

37:40.842 --> 37:43.553
until we get our homeland.

37:44.972 --> 37:48.934
All power to the people.

37:48.976 --> 37:51.728
DJ EVANGELINE:
All power to the people,
indeed, Sister.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.022
There you have it,
direct from the BCR.

37:54.064 --> 37:55.691
INOKUCHI:
The situation is escalating.

37:55.732 --> 37:59.528
We must evacuate the Crown
Princess to Tokyo at once.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.029
I will see to it.

38:02.572 --> 38:04.574
(urgent chatter)

38:08.203 --> 38:10.330
(plane passes overhead)

38:10.372 --> 38:11.957
Before I go,

38:11.999 --> 38:13.709
I must ask you to be truthful

38:13.750 --> 38:15.711
with me one more time.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.966
When I've made my report
to the Emperor,

38:21.008 --> 38:22.968
he will ask me one question.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.970
(exhales)

38:25.012 --> 38:27.514
And the answer I give...

38:27.556 --> 38:30.517
will depend on what you report.

38:30.559 --> 38:32.561
I understand, Your Highness.

38:36.148 --> 38:39.317
Can we hold this territory?

38:39.359 --> 38:42.362
I believe that in time...

38:42.404 --> 38:45.741
with enough firepower
and troops...

38:45.782 --> 38:48.702
we can finish
these Negro rebels.

38:51.747 --> 38:53.999
But the price will be paid...

38:54.041 --> 38:57.335
with the blood and souls
of the sons of Japan.

38:57.377 --> 38:59.379
(plane passes overhead)

39:01.423 --> 39:04.634
I once felt that any price
was worth paying.

39:06.470 --> 39:10.307
We... can prevail,
Crown Princess...

39:12.642 --> 39:14.644
...but I no longer believe
we should.

39:18.899 --> 39:20.609
I realize...

39:20.650 --> 39:22.778
what you've just said
goes against

39:22.819 --> 39:26.198
your every instinct.

39:26.239 --> 39:29.201
For that, you have
my respect, Taisa.

39:29.242 --> 39:31.828
Rest assured...

39:31.870 --> 39:35.415
I will bring your message
to the Emperor.

41:30.280 --> 41:33.909
has developed not necessarily
to Japan's advantage.

Should we continue to devote
our precious resources

41:37.579 --> 41:39.831
to occupying
the Japanese Pacific States,

41:39.873 --> 41:42.250
