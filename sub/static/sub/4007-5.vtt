00:10.160 --> 00:11.879
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:12.040 --> 00:13.440
What did you do to Yates?

00:13.640 --> 00:17.714
He has a scar exactly where your killer
has been harvesting brain fragments.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.355
High heels are
a far cry from brains.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.876
It's not exactly
your killer's usual MO.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.760
Albert wouldn't be
the first to alter his methods.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.111
She's found herself a hero.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.917
I know her. Janet Thorton.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.479
Think the girl will be all right?

00:32.640 --> 00:35.075
I stemmed the bleeding,
dropped her off in front of the ER.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.040
Patient files. Your patient files.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.270
Dexter, don't.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.955
"Somehow he's deluded himself
into thinking

00:42.120 --> 00:44.635
his feelings for his sister
are genuine."

00:44.800 --> 00:46.632
You're trying
to keep me from Deb.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.917
It's another way to isolate
your subject.

00:49.080 --> 00:53.552
See what he'll do. When Yates is
dead, you are out of my life.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.833
You understand?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.912
What about you?
What makes you crazy?

00:59.640 --> 01:03.634
Family shit.
Nothing says family like shit.

01:04.239 --> 01:06.118
I see a lot of your father in you.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.273
Harry wrestled with the same
doubts regarding Dexter.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.517
<i>The code is a theory.</i>

01:12.760 --> 01:15.559
<i>What Dexter did--
What we did--</i>

01:15.800 --> 01:17.439
<i>I don't think I can live with this.</i>

01:17.720 --> 01:19.234
Did Dad kill himself?

01:19.440 --> 01:21.272
He OD'd on his heart medication.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.551
He thought he'd created
a monster.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.319
I think I know how he felt.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.199
But he only got it half right.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.800
Well, we're never
gonna get anywhere

04:00.960 --> 04:02.997
unless one of you starts talking.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.913
Okay.

04:08.600 --> 04:12.674
Debra, it seems that you tried
to kill Dexter as well as yourself.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.035
Yes, but then I saved him.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.276
You saved me? You only had to save
me because you tried to kill me.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.069
I know, but--
You almost left my son an orphan.

04:26.320 --> 04:28.630
Harrison.
Who's gonna take care of him?

04:28.800 --> 04:30.234
Who?

04:33.400 --> 04:36.359
I don't know.
All I've done my whole life

04:36.520 --> 04:38.910
is try to take care of you,
to protect you.

04:39.120 --> 04:42.511
Protect? Jesus Christ.
If this is your way of protecting me--

04:42.680 --> 04:45.149
Okay, so I'm not perfect!

04:45.800 --> 04:47.678
You think it's easy
being your brother?

04:47.880 --> 04:49.792
You're not even listening to me.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.953
You don't understand.
I've been trapped in a fucking fog--

04:53.120 --> 04:54.520
No, I don't understand.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.149
Haven't you heard
anything she said?

04:57.320 --> 04:59.630
I'm stupid that way.
My brain is limited.

04:59.800 --> 05:04.431
So when my sister tries to kill me,
for some reason, it doesn't make sense.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.920
It's true, Dexter, what she said.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.909
While in the throes of PTSD,
one's thinking becomes cloudy.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.312
The weight of what
she has been through

05:15.480 --> 05:17.517
has been too much for her to bear.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.633
Debra has been in such a turmoil

05:20.840 --> 05:24.151
that she sought out the first solution
that presented itself.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.990
I had just found out that Dad
killed himself because of you.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.751
Because of what you are.

05:31.600 --> 05:35.640
I was fucking traumatised
by all this shit.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.639
Yeah, so try to kill us both.
That solves everything.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.437
You are overlooking an important part
of what happened, Dexter.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.076
Yes, she tried to kill you,
the both of you.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.954
And that was Debra
hitting rock bottom.

05:50.160 --> 05:53.232
But ultimately, as she said,
she saved you.

05:53.400 --> 05:57.076
And that was Debra's
first step toward recovery.

05:58.280 --> 06:01.273
You should see that as
a promising sign for your sister.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.714
Great.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.315
I'm so fucking happy for you.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.552
I was trying to catch a serial killer
before you tried to drown me.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.552
I think I'm gonna get back to that.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.120
Which, to you, is all I'm good for.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.756
Don't, Dexter.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.832
To hell with both of you.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.475
Don't forget to write all this down.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.352
I've never seen him so mad.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.753
That wasn't just anger.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.037
Fuck, it wasn't?
No.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.471
Underneath all that is hurt.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.075
Dexter is deeply hurt
by what you did.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.431
Well, that makes two of us.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.799
<i>Family therapy. Who needs it?</i>

06:56.360 --> 06:58.920
<i>Family. A burden.</i>

06:59.080 --> 07:01.072
<i>They interfere.</i>

07:01.280 --> 07:03.033
<i>They annoy.</i>

07:04.880 --> 07:06.314
Daddy, I wanna watch cartoons.

07:06.480 --> 07:07.550
<i>They interrupt.</i>

07:07.720 --> 07:09.393
You need to get ready for school.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.711
I wanna watch cartoons.
School.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.475
<i>Yates could be anywhere now.
He could've left Miami.</i>

07:14.640 --> 07:16.359
Dexter, do you have
any plans for tonight?

07:16.520 --> 07:17.556
Um...

07:18.920 --> 07:20.513
Not sure.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.675
<i>Dexter Morgan.</i>

07:25.880 --> 07:27.030
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

07:27.200 --> 07:29.157
It's me. Can we talk?

07:31.480 --> 07:33.119
Fuck.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.074
Harrison, apple or banana?
Banana.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.311
I was thinking of having
Cassie over for dinner.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.355
Okay, go ahead.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.795
I mean here.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.036
Why?

07:44.240 --> 07:45.993
I think you'd hit it off.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.914
Five minutes of cartoons.
No minutes of cartoons.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.959
You need to get dressed.
So is that a yes?

07:52.120 --> 07:54.430
Is what a yes?
Dinner tonight.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.000
Two minutes of cartoons?

07:56.200 --> 07:57.714
This is not a negotiation.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.394
Now.
Eight o'clock?

07:59.560 --> 08:00.835
Please, please, please?

08:01.560 --> 08:03.552
Yeah, fine.
Harrison, last warning.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.914
I gotta go.
Okay, bye.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.880
<i>This is one of the first days
I'm glad Deb isn't here.</i>

08:33.840 --> 08:35.354
<i>I can lock myself in the lab,</i>

08:35.520 --> 08:38.115
<i>don't have to listen
to anyone's voice but my own.</i>

08:38.280 --> 08:39.919
We gotta go
to the briefing room.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.193
Now?

08:42.400 --> 08:43.754
Now would be good.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.038
Probably wondering
why I'm smiling.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.590
I'm never wondering
why you're smiling.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.434
I've just confirmed
that I have a daughter.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.836
Someone let you impregnate them?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.720
Made a donation
to a sperm bank 20 years ago.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.679
You're not saying there's
a female version of you?

09:10.880 --> 09:13.111
You met her. Niki.
The one you showed in.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.596
That chick in your lab? No way.
Yes way.

09:15.760 --> 09:18.036
That beautiful girl
came from you?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.114
Yes, indeed.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.600
Are you sure she's yours?

09:21.760 --> 09:24.673
Who you talking to here?
She came in with the paperwork.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.833
I pulled a piece of her hair.
I just finished testing it.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.793
She's a Masuka,
through and through.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.559
That poor sweet child.

09:31.800 --> 09:35.430
So you and me, Dex,
both dads. How about that?

09:36.280 --> 09:38.397
Great news, Vince.

09:38.560 --> 09:42.474
You know, I'm sure it's all fine,
but just be careful, you know?

09:42.680 --> 09:44.956
Family showing up like that,
out of nowhere?

09:45.120 --> 09:46.634
Hey, what do you mean?

09:46.800 --> 09:49.793
Sometimes it's just because
they want something, you know?

09:49.960 --> 09:53.476
Money, a place to stay,
a fucking kidney.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.313
<i>Or they wanna kill you.</i>

09:56.720 --> 10:00.430
Lieutenant Batista is currently with
Janet Thorton, the, uh, stabbing victim

10:00.600 --> 10:03.115
who was dropped at the hospital.
She came to

10:03.280 --> 10:04.680
and is ready
to make a statement.

10:04.840 --> 10:05.910
<i>She survived.</i>

10:06.120 --> 10:08.077
<i>One less trophy for Yates.</i>

10:08.240 --> 10:11.677
So I'm running the briefing.
The Norma Rivera case.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.714
The victim had sex with someone
before she was killed.

10:14.960 --> 10:18.670
We're following the theory that whoever
she had sex with is her killer.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.275
Were you able to identify
anyone via the semen?

10:21.440 --> 10:24.000
Uh, no matches in any
of the criminal databases.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.790
Whoever had relations with
Ms. Rivera has never been arrested.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.952
ME's report showed
no defensive wounds?

10:30.120 --> 10:32.760
Correct.
It's most likely not a rape.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.674
She was probably friendly
with whoever killed her.

10:36.520 --> 10:37.874
What about
the ex-boyfriend?

10:38.040 --> 10:39.474
No, we ruled him out.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.872
He's been locked up in Orlando
for the week on assault charge.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.078
We questioned the staff
of Ms. Rivera's former employers.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.880
They led us to believe
she'd been having an affair

10:49.080 --> 10:50.912
with the boss, Ed Hamilton.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.073
When we tried to speak to him,
he lawyered up immediately.

10:54.240 --> 10:57.233
So we got a court order
to compel a DNA sample from him,

10:57.400 --> 10:59.551
see if Hamilton was
Rivera's last visitor.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.674
You think Hamilton killed Norma
to cover up their affair?

11:03.840 --> 11:08.119
We're looking into it. Old, rich men don't
like having their dirty laundry aired,

11:08.280 --> 11:10.033
especially when it's the maid.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.194
Dexter, I'm gonna need you to join me
and Miller in paying Hamilton a visit.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.835
Janet Thorton gave us
the name of her abductor.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.912
Albert Yates.
We got a home address.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.720
I'm grabbing some unis now
and heading over there.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.200
<i>You won't find him home.</i>

11:23.360 --> 11:25.317
All right, let's get moving.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.998
Lieutenant, got a minute?
Yeah.

11:31.160 --> 11:34.039
You had Quinn run the briefing.
Yeah, how'd he do?

11:34.200 --> 11:35.680
He was fine.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.360
Really? Good.

11:37.520 --> 11:40.035
Is he your choice
for sergeant?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.471
I haven't yet
made that decision.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.991
I used to run the morning
briefings back in the Gang Unit.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.880
I'm ready to take on
more responsibility.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.034
Good to know. Thanks.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.431
I just wanna make sure
you're aware

12:11.600 --> 12:15.230
that the Hamiltons are
good friends to Miami Metro.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.873
Sure.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.191
Be respectful.

12:24.760 --> 12:28.071
Any of Mr. Hamilton's
indiscretions

12:28.240 --> 12:32.996
should take a back seat
to solving Ms. Rivera's murder.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.878
I understand.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.680
Good.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.720
We're here for Mr. Hamilton.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.473
Mr. Hamilton.
Mm-hm?

13:09.680 --> 13:12.673
These police officers
are here to see you.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.158
Thank you, Claudia.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.119
My lawyer made it clear
I wouldn't be speaking to you.

13:21.320 --> 13:22.879
You don't have to say a word.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.599
We're just here for a cheek swab.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.672
A what?
It's a DNA sample.

13:26.840 --> 13:27.956
We have a warrant.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.117
Failure to cooperate
will give us no choice

13:30.280 --> 13:32.476
but to arrest you.
Why do you need DNA?

13:32.640 --> 13:34.233
Ms. Rivera's autopsy revealed

13:34.400 --> 13:35.993
she recently had sexual relations.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.994
My forensics partner is here
to see if it was with you.

13:39.160 --> 13:42.039
Wait, wait. There's no need for a test.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.715
Norma and I were having an affair.

13:48.920 --> 13:52.072
My wife found out
and insisted she be dismissed.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.960
<i>A scorned spouse. Was it the wife?</i>

13:55.120 --> 13:57.840
- So your wife knew?
- Just how upset was she?

13:58.000 --> 14:01.960
No. My wife's been in Atlanta visiting
her sister for the past two weeks.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.476
Which is giving you time
to visit Ms. Rivera.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.120
No. Yes.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.916
I mean,
I didn't visit her.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.791
She came by here to pick up a
few things she left behind...

14:14.840 --> 14:17.036
and one thing
led to another, and, uh...

14:17.760 --> 14:20.229
we did have sex that day.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.590
But she left here alive.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.079
You, uh, didn't visit her apartment

14:27.240 --> 14:28.276
later that day, did you?

14:28.440 --> 14:29.760
I was here all day.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.320
<i>The Hamiltons' son.</i>

14:31.520 --> 14:33.113
Can anyone corroborate that?

14:33.280 --> 14:34.396
Dad?

14:37.720 --> 14:39.791
Dad, what's going on?
Go inside.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.670
You want me to call someone?
I don't want anything. Go inside.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.154
All right.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.951
Sorry about that.
Where were we?

14:54.160 --> 14:55.833
You were saying you have proof

14:56.040 --> 14:57.554
that Ms. Rivera left the premises.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.154
My security cameras.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.754
You'll see Norma
arrive and leave

15:00.960 --> 15:03.634
through the main gate,
alone.

15:04.760 --> 15:08.276
I never, ever
would hurt Norma.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.993
I loved her.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.159
<i>But does he love his son?</i>

15:23.520 --> 15:25.352
<i>It's Deb.</i>

15:29.720 --> 15:31.120
Hello--

15:32.040 --> 15:33.360
<i>Damn it.</i>

15:45.560 --> 15:47.074
Hey.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.400
Hey.

15:50.360 --> 15:53.831
So you're, like, what, the DNA guy?

15:54.040 --> 15:58.910
I'm a forensic technician, specialising
in blood spatter analysis.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.355
Whoa.

16:01.480 --> 16:05.554
So did you go to the place
where Norma Rivera was killed?

16:05.720 --> 16:06.915
I did.

16:07.080 --> 16:11.916
And what did you see in,
you know, your analysis?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.598
She was beaten to death.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.952
Confidential, huh?

16:20.520 --> 16:22.034
Well, for what it's worth,

16:22.200 --> 16:24.999
you're wasting your time
investigating my dad.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.994
He's an asshole, but not a killer.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.351
That's quite a testament.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.514
In my family,
it's about as good as it gets.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.755
<i>One more happy family.</i>

17:21.119 --> 17:24.271
Try and get away, and I'll kill you.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.392
<i>You've reached Dr. Evelyn Vogel.</i>

17:28.600 --> 17:30.751
<i>I'm not available at this time.
Please leave a message.</i>

17:32.080 --> 17:34.993
Dr. Vogel, it's Debra. I'm--

17:35.640 --> 17:38.792
I need to talk to you, so...

17:39.840 --> 17:41.718
I'm gonna come by.

17:57.120 --> 17:59.112
Dr. Vogel?

17:59.760 --> 18:00.796
Fuck.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.514
<i>Graves marked by rosebushes.</i>

18:06.680 --> 18:08.353
<i>Yates' previous victims.</i>

18:08.560 --> 18:11.075
<i>He liked to keep them close.</i>

18:11.760 --> 18:15.310
Three bodies so far. A rosebush
planted on top of each.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.360
You think there are three more?

18:17.520 --> 18:18.556
Count on it.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.918
The sick bastard turned his basement
into a torture room.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.150
Yo, Dex, check this out.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.714
All of his victims
have broken phalanges.

18:29.920 --> 18:34.392
And it looks like the bones were
broken in sequence, not all at once.

18:34.560 --> 18:38.474
Look. This bone here had
begun the process of mending.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.235
So he kept them there
in that room for what, weeks?

18:41.400 --> 18:44.996
Looks like it. He broke each of their
toes until he was done, then--

18:45.160 --> 18:47.994
Finished them off with
a single stab to the chest.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.356
We think this was
one of his first victims.

18:50.560 --> 18:54.554
We believe it's Kendall Jaynes,
been missing since 2008.

18:54.720 --> 18:58.714
He buries the victims' purses
and IDs with the bodies.

18:58.880 --> 19:03.557
And, get this, with each one,
the left shoe.

19:03.760 --> 19:08.198
I mean, heh, I like feet,
but this is just cray-cray.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.473
Deb. Looking to get
your old job back?

19:11.640 --> 19:13.199
We could use you.
We have six bodies.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.158
I need to talk to Dexter.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.674
Dex.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.360
Thanks. Deb, this isn't--

19:19.520 --> 19:21.876
It's an emergency.
Vogel's been taken.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.636
What do you mean?
I went to her house.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.996
Someone had smashed the window.
She's gone.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.554
Have you called her?

19:34.760 --> 19:36.513
A fucking dozen times, no answer.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.991
It's Yates. He's still in Miami.
I should've killed him already.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.833
I wanna help.
No.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.152
Dexter--
You tried helping, it didn't work out.

19:45.320 --> 19:47.630
That was about killing.
This is about saving.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.395
It's dangerous.
I fucking know it's dangerous.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.358
Vogel's life is at stake.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.872
You can hate me,
but can we just set that aside

19:56.040 --> 19:59.351
until we know that she's okay?
I don't hate you.

20:09.320 --> 20:12.518
Why'd you save me?
Why didn't you let me drown?

20:19.560 --> 20:22.712
I saw the car going underwater.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.716
I knew you were gonna die.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.559
I couldn't imagine my life
without you in it.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.315
So now what? Everything
just goes back to normal?

20:49.560 --> 20:51.517
It was never normal.

20:54.080 --> 20:57.710
I need to do this.
I really need to help.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.114
We need to find Vogel.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.672
We should bring
the police in on this.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.719
They're already doing everything
they can to find Yates.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.395
This is his work log.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.231
These are all the houses
he's worked in,

21:26.400 --> 21:29.279
some of which might be empty
during the summer.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.830
That's the perfect place
to go with a hostage.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.038
That is a lot of places to search, Dexter.
We need Metro's help.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.872
They'll be helping us.
They just won't know it.

21:39.040 --> 21:42.920
Just plot those places out on a map.
Don't do anything on your own.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.871
You still don't trust me, do you?

21:47.040 --> 21:48.918
I don't want you hurt.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.996
So who's the guy?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.798
What guy?

22:04.040 --> 22:06.600
A.J., this is very serious,
what you're doing.

22:06.800 --> 22:10.271
The guy who broke
into my house!

22:10.680 --> 22:13.673
He's a friend of mine.
I don't like him in my house

22:13.840 --> 22:15.240
going through my things.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.598
No. I understand.
Good!

22:24.480 --> 22:28.633
A.J., I think I know
what this is about.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.237
It's your surgery.
You blame me.

22:31.400 --> 22:35.872
What? This little thing? No!

22:36.080 --> 22:40.233
I liked having my skull sawed open
and a chunk of my brain carved out.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.550
Who wouldn't?

22:41.720 --> 22:45.634
Well, you had a lesion
on the limbic area of your brain.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.355
And I thought
it was causing your--

22:48.520 --> 22:50.830
Your violent episodes.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.397
I was only trying
to make you better.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.796
Well, it worked really well,
didn't it?

22:57.960 --> 23:00.475
You're a hell of a doctor!

23:02.400 --> 23:05.916
I only wanted
what was best for you.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.594
I still do.

23:07.760 --> 23:10.514
That's why you sent your friend
after me.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.349
I asked him to protect me.
I had no choice.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.756
You should've just left me alone.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.480
I will. I will.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.518
You made your point.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.275
There's no reason for us
to go any further.

23:24.440 --> 23:29.515
If you do, you'll be caught and
you'll go to jail and-- Or worse.

23:29.720 --> 23:30.949
My friend is looking for you.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.440
Ah.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.038
Good!

23:35.200 --> 23:38.318
I can't wait till he finds me.
No, no!

23:42.200 --> 23:46.319
The way I hear it, the sergeant spot
is going to be between you and me.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.671
That so?
Not gonna ruin our friendship

23:48.840 --> 23:51.196
when one of us gets it
and the other doesn't?

23:51.360 --> 23:53.272
I didn't know
we had a friendship.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.396
Excuse me.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.279
Miami Metro Homicide.

23:57.440 --> 24:00.114
Don't worry, you're not in trouble.
What's your name?

24:00.280 --> 24:02.840
Armando.
I'm Quinn. This is Detective Miller.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.111
There was a murder here
a few days ago.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.475
Take a look at this.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.112
We were wondering
if you saw that man

24:09.280 --> 24:11.476
around this time of day,
early afternoon?

24:12.280 --> 24:13.839
<i>Sí,</i> I saw him.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.753
Can you point him out to me?
Uh, this one.

24:18.320 --> 24:21.518
Are you sure?
Yes. He drive a Porsche.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.512
You don't see many
Porsches around here.

24:23.720 --> 24:27.396
Would you be willing to give a statement
that that's the guy you saw?

24:27.560 --> 24:31.474
I can come by later today.
Yeah, that's fine.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.597
Here. Ask for me at the front desk.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.795
Great.
Wanna get his information?

24:39.920 --> 24:42.196
Hey.
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

24:42.360 --> 24:46.274
Just got an eyewitness to place
Zach Hamilton at Norma Rivera's

24:46.440 --> 24:47.954
around the time of her killing.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.554
The son?

24:49.720 --> 24:52.440
I wasn't expecting that.
<i>- Me neither.</i>

24:53.200 --> 24:56.796
Hm. I'll let Matthews know.
He's been all over me about this case.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.997
<i>All right, bye.</i>
All right.

25:01.240 --> 25:02.879
This is awkward, isn't it?

25:03.080 --> 25:05.276
Heh, heh. Ahem.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.439
Uh, why'd you decide
to look me up now?

25:08.600 --> 25:09.716
Ahem.
Um...

25:09.880 --> 25:12.395
Well, you know,
partly because I moved down here

25:12.560 --> 25:14.119
from St. Augustine for school.

25:14.400 --> 25:17.916
Oh. And what's the other part?

25:18.160 --> 25:20.595
My mom passed recently.

25:20.760 --> 25:23.275
So, um, it's just me now.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.353
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.040
Thanks.

25:30.360 --> 25:34.149
And, uh, your mom
never married?

25:34.320 --> 25:38.519
No, it was always just the two of us.
So now that she's gone,

25:39.040 --> 25:41.600
I guess I've been feeling
kind of alone.

25:41.760 --> 25:44.195
Well, I'm glad
you reached out.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.437
Me too.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.354
What about you?
Are you still single?

25:50.560 --> 25:52.916
Yep. Ahem.
Heh, where do you live?

25:53.080 --> 25:55.595
Oh, I've got a house
down in Coconut Grove.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.513
Fancy.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.876
Are you, like, Mr. Rich-Guy?
Ha, ha.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.034
Well, uh...

26:03.240 --> 26:04.799
I bet you drive a Ferrari.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.153
Masook, what can I get for you?

26:07.320 --> 26:09.437
Hey, Marty, um, just a coffee for me.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.920
And, uh, Niki?

26:11.600 --> 26:15.389
Um, can I have a double cappuccino
and a blueberry muffin?

26:16.600 --> 26:18.990
And a veggie burrito to go, please.

26:23.400 --> 26:27.030
I left my bag in the car.
I'm sorry. Can you get this one?

26:27.200 --> 26:29.237
Yeah, no, no. Heh, heh.
I'll get the next one.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.033
No problem, my treat.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.720
Thank you.
Yeah.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.439
Oh, hey, uh, can you add, um,

26:34.600 --> 26:35.716
cheese to my burrito?

26:35.880 --> 26:38.111
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.192
<i>Yates has installed cable and Internet</i>

26:42.360 --> 26:44.192
<i>from one end of Miami to the other.</i>

26:44.360 --> 26:47.432
<i>If I only look at homes he worked on
in the past two weeks,</i>

26:47.640 --> 26:50.951
<i>it'll still take days to figure out
which homes are vacant.</i>

26:51.360 --> 26:53.397
<i>If he's even in one of them.</i>

26:53.560 --> 26:57.918
<i>And with Vogel being held by Yates,
doing what he does...</i>

27:00.200 --> 27:03.238
<i>Batista should be done looking
into Yates' money trail.</i>

27:03.440 --> 27:06.911
<i>Time to see if Miami Metro
can help me narrow this down.</i>

27:14.520 --> 27:16.318
Yeah, I'm on hold. Come in.

27:17.520 --> 27:20.354
Just checking to see how
your end of the hunt's going.

27:20.520 --> 27:24.150
Well, just got his credit history.
He hasn't used his charge cards

27:24.320 --> 27:26.277
in the last three days,
so that trail is cold.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.996
So he's using cash?
Yeah.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.196
He's on the run.

27:30.360 --> 27:34.115
He'd probably have to be withdrawing
his funds from his bank or ATM.

27:34.280 --> 27:37.000
I got a judge to expedite
a warrant on his accounts.

27:37.160 --> 27:38.389
I'm on hold with the bank.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.199
<i>Thank you for holding.</i>

27:40.360 --> 27:41.840
<i>Withdrawals were
in Morningside Park.</i>

27:42.000 --> 27:44.469
<i>Would you like receipts?</i>
That would be fine.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.160
<i>Thank you. Bye.</i>
Thank you.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.069
Good news?

27:48.240 --> 27:50.835
Yates hit up an ATM
near Morningside Park

27:51.000 --> 27:53.390
two times in the last couple of days.

27:53.560 --> 27:57.156
He could be holed up in that area.
We'll get some unis out there.

27:57.360 --> 28:00.558
If he shows his face, we'll get him.
Yeah, we'll get him.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.634
No, it's a clusterfuck.
We had a witness place Zach

28:06.800 --> 28:09.360
at the murder scene
within the time of her death.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.989
We bring him in,
he can't remember anything.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.470
Not unusual for a witness
to change his mind.

28:14.640 --> 28:17.200
Someone paid him off.
Rich parents like Zach has,

28:17.400 --> 28:19.039
it's not hard to put
two and two together.

28:19.200 --> 28:22.432
Hm. You have any other witnesses
that put Zach at the scene?

28:22.600 --> 28:26.514
No. I'll bring that kid in for questioning
and get a confession out of him.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.916
Waste of time.
You have nothing to go on.

28:29.080 --> 28:31.993
His lawyers won't let him say a word.
He killed her.

28:32.160 --> 28:35.153
You don't know that.
Your only witness recanted.

28:35.320 --> 28:36.834
You have no case.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.959
Now, look, you find
something more concrete,

28:40.120 --> 28:41.679
you'll have my full backing.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.991
But until then,
leave the kid alone.

28:44.240 --> 28:47.358
No reason to make enemies
unless we really have to,

28:47.920 --> 28:51.391
especially when there are people
trying to move up to sergeant.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.074
Capiche?

28:53.400 --> 28:54.993
Yeah.

29:00.040 --> 29:03.192
What exactly are we looking for
in the Morningside Park area?

29:03.360 --> 29:06.751
We need to start figuring out
what kind of buildings these are.

29:06.920 --> 29:10.630
Any apartments or condos or businesses
can be scratched off the list.

29:10.800 --> 29:13.076
And why are we...?
I can't.

29:13.240 --> 29:17.393
I know, got it. Top-secret shit between
you and your brother. Understood.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.076
Look at that, a paying client.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.476
I guess I should go and--
Oh, that's a friend of mine.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.631
Good. Hope he needs a favour.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.875
Masuka, what's up?

29:30.080 --> 29:31.275
I pass by here all the time.

29:31.440 --> 29:35.434
I figured I'd finally
see where you work.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.438
This is it.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.438
It's nice.
Yeah.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.638
Can we go somewhere
more private to talk?

29:42.840 --> 29:45.071
Sure.
Okay.

29:47.520 --> 29:48.556
What's up?

29:48.760 --> 29:52.800
I wanna hire you to do
a background check on someone.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.351
You do background checks
all the time.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.120
Why would you waste your money?
I know, right.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.390
It's more of a personal situation.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.832
Right. Who are we stalking?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.878
Heh, heh, heh.

30:07.320 --> 30:10.438
It's, uh, a family member.
Ooh, gotta be careful.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.115
Don't always wanna know
everything about family.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.715
Yeah, well, I really need this.
All right.

30:15.880 --> 30:19.191
Give me a name.
Niki Walters.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.115
Who is it? A cousin?

30:23.400 --> 30:24.595
Daughter.

30:25.400 --> 30:26.914
I know, right?

30:27.080 --> 30:28.958
I donated sperm
back in college.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.391
I've got a 20-year-old daughter.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.080
She just showed up out of the blue.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.350
Wow, that's fucking weird.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.831
I mean, she seems
really nice, you know?

30:39.040 --> 30:43.956
She's smart. She's pretty.
Seems normal.

30:44.560 --> 30:47.394
But I keep asking myself,
"What's the catch?"

30:47.600 --> 30:50.274
Maybe she just wants
to get to know you.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.040
Maybe.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.717
Or maybe she saw an easy mark
to hit up for money.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.389
You really think
she's here to rip you off?

30:59.160 --> 31:01.356
I don't know what to think.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.071
I've got no family
except for my parents.

31:05.240 --> 31:08.950
And they're off, retired,
living <i>la vida loca</i> in Tampa.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.317
So it's just me.

31:11.520 --> 31:14.797
And now Niki shows up.

31:15.120 --> 31:21.196
I mean, I like the idea of having
a daughter, family, right?

31:21.440 --> 31:24.512
But if she's here
just for my money...

31:24.880 --> 31:27.349
I'm sure it's fine.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.837
And either way, it's--

31:31.240 --> 31:34.039
It's really nice to have family.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.152
Trust me.

31:37.640 --> 31:40.439
You'll be discreet?
I don't want her to know

31:40.600 --> 31:43.672
I'm looking into her like this.
She'll never know.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.797
- Yes, please.
- Oh, yeah.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.557
Hey.
Hey.

31:52.800 --> 31:53.870
You want a beer?

31:54.040 --> 31:55.679
You remember Cassie, right?

31:55.880 --> 31:57.758
Cassie, yeah.
New neighbour, hi.

31:57.960 --> 32:01.271
Yes, it's good to meet you again.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.193
Jamie, can I talk to you for a sec?

32:04.480 --> 32:07.234
Sure. Joey, keep stirring that.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.192
What are they doing
in my apartment?

32:12.360 --> 32:14.352
Did you forget we had plans?
Plans?

32:14.520 --> 32:15.840
Dinner, remember?

32:16.880 --> 32:17.870
Right.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.993
I figured we'd make it a double date.
Less awkward this way.

32:21.160 --> 32:23.470
I'm gonna have to reschedule.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.759
Excuse me just a sec.
Joey, keep stirring that.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.280
I'm stirring it!

32:34.520 --> 32:38.036
Dexter. You can't do this.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.316
Do what?

32:39.480 --> 32:41.472
I went out of my way
to set this up.

32:41.640 --> 32:44.633
I made <i>platanos fritos.</i>
I planned this whole night for you.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.120
I'm sorry, something came up.

32:46.280 --> 32:49.432
No. No, you do this to me
all the time.

32:49.600 --> 32:53.037
And I don't mind, I really don't.
But I invited Cassie and Joey.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.880
You can't be rude to them.
Jamie, really, I have to go.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.759
If you even try to walk out that
door, Dexter, I will leave.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.674
You'll be stuck here
with Harrison all night long.

33:03.840 --> 33:06.116
Jamie--
This is for your own good.

33:06.280 --> 33:09.557
You haven't gone out with anyone
since Hannah. Stay for dinner.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.791
When we're done,
I'll stay with Harrison

33:11.960 --> 33:14.236
so you can go do
whatever you have to do.

33:17.760 --> 33:21.151
<i>Serial killer bested
by 100-pound nanny.</i>

33:21.360 --> 33:22.680
Born and raised.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.077
Dexter's lived in Miami
his whole life.

33:29.160 --> 33:31.391
I'm gonna get some more wine.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.872
Deb.
I've got 12 potential homes

33:36.040 --> 33:39.238
Yates could be using as a hideout.
Shit. I've got seven.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.437
That's a lot to cover.
Let's go.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.351
I'll call you back in five minutes.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.398
- So another S.
- Yeah, to you.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.677
<i>Saving Private Ryan.</i>

33:51.440 --> 33:53.079
I love blunt things in my mouth.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.356
Oh, jeez.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.159
Excuse me.

33:56.320 --> 33:58.357
Hey. Want some help
opening the wine?

33:58.800 --> 34:02.680
Ah, actually, this is a little embarrassing,
but I kind of need to leave.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.071
Oh, work? I get it.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.516
When I worked in finance,
I was at it 24/7.

34:07.680 --> 34:09.956
Yeah, 24/7.

34:10.480 --> 34:13.951
But the thing is, Jamie's put
a lot of time into this whole thing.

34:14.120 --> 34:17.556
Right, you don't wanna piss off
the nanny. Look, um, go.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.598
I'll take care of Jamie. We'll be fine.

34:21.880 --> 34:25.112
Maybe we could reschedule?
Yeah. I'd like that.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.391
Perfect.
Okay.

34:28.280 --> 34:32.559
I'm really sorry to be the party pooper
but I've got an early morning.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.199
Mind if I call it a night?

34:34.360 --> 34:36.397
Yeah, turns out
I have to take off too.

34:36.560 --> 34:40.520
Thanks for watching Harrison.
I'm sorry.

34:40.719 --> 34:42.518
I know you went to so much trouble.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.199
What the fuck took you so long?

34:50.400 --> 34:51.993
It's a long story.

34:52.159 --> 34:54.719
We have 19 houses
we have to look into.

34:54.880 --> 34:57.554
At night? Fuck me.
How are we even gonna see

34:57.720 --> 35:01.714
if Vogel and Yates are in a house, if
they're even holed up in one of these?

35:01.880 --> 35:04.952
What if he's already killed her?
He hasn't. She's fine.

35:05.160 --> 35:08.597
He keeps his women alive
for weeks. We'll find her.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.797
Yeah, we will. We have to.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.509
I'll pick you up in five minutes.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.358
We'll find her.

35:21.240 --> 35:22.754
Stay still.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.640
Unless you want me
to restrain you.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.351
You're not angry with me, A.J.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.752
You're angry with her.
Shut up.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.640
And you have every right to be.

35:48.240 --> 35:52.280
Your mother abused you horribly,
beat you.

35:53.160 --> 35:56.119
Probably caused the lesion.
Don't talk about her.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.714
But I understand, A.J.

35:57.920 --> 36:01.709
I understand the terror you felt.

36:02.760 --> 36:06.310
She hit you, slapped you.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.595
You'd find a safe place
under the bed.

36:10.640 --> 36:14.395
And she'd look for you, raging.

36:14.680 --> 36:17.718
And you'd curl up under there,

36:17.920 --> 36:22.597
looking out, waiting.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.674
She'd pace back and forth
in front of the bed.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.274
Yes.

36:29.440 --> 36:33.320
Shoes clacking.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.512
Feel the panic rising.

36:40.240 --> 36:44.075
The pain you knew awaited.

36:51.720 --> 36:52.915
Hm.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.075
Don't say another fucking word.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.320
No, no.

37:04.480 --> 37:08.554
Now, you can take the pain
and live a little longer

37:08.720 --> 37:12.760
or you can stop struggling,
and I'll kill you right now.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.720
Good.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.434
So...

37:24.840 --> 37:29.392
which little piggy
won't be making it to market?

37:34.000 --> 37:36.276
Albert, stop it!

37:36.880 --> 37:39.520
Don't call me that.
Only my mother called me that.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.752
Stop that, Albert, now.
No.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.355
Don't you talk back to me,
you little shit!

37:45.520 --> 37:50.311
I'm not afraid of you.
All you ever do is disappoint me.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.798
Enough!

38:21.440 --> 38:23.159
Stay.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.836
<i>Don't know this number.</i>

39:12.000 --> 39:13.593
<i>Not this house.</i>

39:19.000 --> 39:20.753
Morgan.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.319
<i>Here.</i>

39:23.480 --> 39:26.314
<i>Let me help you with that cut.</i>

39:27.600 --> 39:31.355
You shouldn't call me Albert.
My name is A.J.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.034
I'm sorry.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.436
It's Vogel. She's alive.
What?

39:35.640 --> 39:37.518
She is with Yates.
She called me.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.751
She left her phone out
or something.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.879
Oh, my God.
<i>You're still bleeding.</i>

39:43.040 --> 39:45.236
It's local. You think Elway
can trace this?

39:45.440 --> 39:48.911
I don't know. I can fucking ask him.
<i>Let me take care of you.</i>

39:49.840 --> 39:50.990
Deb, what's up?

39:51.200 --> 39:52.793
Look, I don't wanna
explain to you

39:52.960 --> 39:55.953
why I can't go through the
police, and I know it's illegal,

39:56.160 --> 39:58.720
but I need you to trace
a number for me.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.236
What's the number?

40:01.400 --> 40:03.039
<i>You're no different than Mom.</i>

40:03.200 --> 40:05.476
<i>Yes, I am. I understand.</i>

40:05.640 --> 40:07.438
How long is this gonna take?

40:07.600 --> 40:09.831
Fuck if I know.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.432
What if he kills her?

40:13.120 --> 40:15.794
I thought you said it takes
like a week for him--

40:15.960 --> 40:17.917
I know what I said.
<i>It's bullshit.</i>

40:18.080 --> 40:19.753
<i>You're angry.</i>

40:19.920 --> 40:21.513
Let's not think like this.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.239
<i>You had a horrible childhood.</i>

40:24.840 --> 40:27.878
<i>But you don't have to live your life...</i>

40:28.040 --> 40:31.750
Yeah?
One-five-seven Montgomery.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.912
<i>You're a fucking saint. Thank you.</i>

40:34.160 --> 40:36.356
One-five-seven Montgomery.
You know where that is?

40:40.680 --> 40:42.558
<i>You shouldn't have hit me.</i>

40:43.560 --> 40:47.713
She hit him?
<i>I was scared.</i>

40:48.720 --> 40:50.200
I can still help you.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.113
You don't have to be angry at me.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.431
You can't help me.
I can.

40:54.600 --> 40:57.195
I understand
what you've been through.

40:57.360 --> 41:02.640
<i>No child should ever have to hide
under a bed from a parent.</i>

41:05.040 --> 41:07.555
<i>You sought connection with her,</i>

41:08.440 --> 41:11.160
and all she gave you
was pain.

41:12.760 --> 41:15.878
What-- What you do
for your women,

41:16.040 --> 41:19.716
it's a search
for that same connection

41:19.880 --> 41:22.395
that you never got
from your mother.

41:24.440 --> 41:28.878
<i>But what we have here now,
in this moment, you and I?</i>

41:29.160 --> 41:32.995
<i>This is real human connection.</i>

41:34.040 --> 41:38.637
<i>What you have with your victims,
that only pales in comparison.</i>

41:39.800 --> 41:41.871
<i>Do you understand?</i>

41:43.160 --> 41:45.959
My poor, poor boy.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.158
All you want is to belong, don't you?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.071
<i>I can help you.</i>

41:53.280 --> 41:55.954
<i>I can, trust me.</i>

42:05.160 --> 42:07.629
Oh, what did you do?
I didn't.

42:07.800 --> 42:11.840
Who did you call? Is this your friend?
Dexter, Dexter!

42:12.000 --> 42:14.640
<i>Yeah, you call him. Fuck you, Dexter!</i>

42:54.280 --> 42:55.634
Fuck.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.435
You okay?
Yeah.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.432
Oh, fucking Christ.

43:33.080 --> 43:34.480
Are you all right?

43:34.640 --> 43:35.790
Yeah, I think so.

43:35.960 --> 43:38.077
Did he hurt you?
No.

43:38.240 --> 43:41.153
No. Thank you. Thank you.

43:41.360 --> 43:43.397
Where's Yates?

43:53.840 --> 43:56.309
Let's get you out of here.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.312
Then we can find Yates.

44:13.800 --> 44:16.440
Debra, are you okay?

44:16.640 --> 44:18.632
I'm good.

44:18.840 --> 44:20.593
Really, I'm good.

44:20.840 --> 44:23.480
Let's just get this cleaned up
and get out of here.

44:26.520 --> 44:28.432
Brain cores.

44:29.160 --> 44:31.914
I'll dump them
with Yates' body.

44:33.560 --> 44:36.632
So this is finally over.

44:37.080 --> 44:39.276
My tormentor is dead.

44:39.480 --> 44:41.631
Thanks to you, Dexter.

44:42.720 --> 44:46.316
And Deb.
Yes. And Deb.

44:46.520 --> 44:49.399
I'm glad to see that the two of you
have managed

44:49.560 --> 44:51.233
to find your way back to each other.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.880
Well, the family that kills together...

45:00.000 --> 45:02.037
You're doing well, Debra.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.759
You're very resilient.

45:05.080 --> 45:06.309
We'll see.

45:06.520 --> 45:08.000
You are.

45:09.360 --> 45:11.511
And you never
gave up on her.

45:11.680 --> 45:13.353
I'm impressed.

45:14.080 --> 45:16.436
I know Harry would be too.

45:16.720 --> 45:20.350
He was always concerned
that, as you grew older,

45:20.520 --> 45:22.830
you might drift apart.

45:24.400 --> 45:27.313
Well, we never really
had a choice.

45:28.480 --> 45:32.110
If anyone really knew us,
they would run screaming.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.359
This is everything.

45:41.480 --> 45:42.675
Okay.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.037
So is this it?

45:51.840 --> 45:55.072
<i>A few days ago, everything seemed
hopeless between Deb and me.</i>

45:56.200 --> 46:00.399
<i>But through Dr. Vogel and Yates,</i>

46:00.560 --> 46:02.631
<i>I've got my sister back.</i>

46:04.760 --> 46:07.275
<i>Not like things were before.</i>

46:10.120 --> 46:12.077
<i>It's something different.</i>

46:13.640 --> 46:16.280
<i>But for now, it's enough.</i>

46:18.160 --> 46:20.834
It's beautiful out here, Dexter.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.839
I like it.

46:29.720 --> 46:32.838
It's peaceful,
alone on the water.

46:35.520 --> 46:37.796
Tonight, you brought us.

46:38.440 --> 46:40.591
Yes. Why?

46:45.080 --> 46:47.595
I wanted to be with family.
