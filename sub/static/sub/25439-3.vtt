WEBVTT

00:10.600 --> 00:14.100
We were discussing headlines
from the city newspaper
the other day...

00:16.700 --> 00:18.633
DAN: Damn shame
about MoDeans
burning down.

00:18.666 --> 00:19.633
Do you know what?
It's really something

00:19.666 --> 00:22.866
how we keep losing
those locations
to drink at.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.900
The Ukrainian Center
is a healthy
consolation, though.

00:24.933 --> 00:27.800
Well, everybody knows
the cheapest beers are
at the Ukrainian Center.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.700
With the Legion being
a close second.

00:29.733 --> 00:32.033
When's Gail getting back
from her South American
singles resort?

00:32.066 --> 00:33.866
When she's
had her fill, I suppose.

00:33.900 --> 00:34.933
Delicious pun.

00:34.966 --> 00:36.133
Thank you, Wayne.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.900
ALL: Thank you, Bonnie.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.600
(DAN GRUMBLING)

00:41.833 --> 00:44.100
Now, was that
your tummy grumbling?
Or was that you proper?

00:44.133 --> 00:45.533
DAN: That'd
be me proper.

00:45.566 --> 00:46.866
A little grumble
in the jungle over there.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.000
Little grumble
in the Bronx.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.100
A little
royal grumble.

00:49.133 --> 00:52.533
DAN: It was
a grumble proper.

00:52.566 --> 00:55.800
Now, I'm a devout pupil
of Social Justice Warriors,
Professor Tricia.

00:55.833 --> 00:57.133
The devoutest.

00:57.166 --> 01:00.166
But dare I say things
in the city is getting
wee bit out of hands.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.600
What's the frequency,
Kenneth?

01:01.633 --> 01:04.833
Well, the story I just read
here is quite the incredible
chain of events.

01:04.866 --> 01:06.233
You know, there's
so many causes now.

01:06.266 --> 01:08.133
They're just tripping
right over each other.

01:08.166 --> 01:09.866
Well, it's better than
driving into each other.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.033
That was
a bit dark, Dary.

01:11.066 --> 01:12.166
What's the scoop, Dan?

01:12.200 --> 01:13.466
Here's the scoop.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.866
Bunch of gals said that
they were gonna stop
tweetings for a day

01:15.900 --> 01:18.300
out of protest
for sexual abuses
towards womens.

01:18.333 --> 01:21.233
And they encouraged mens
to stops tweetings
in supports of the womens.

01:21.266 --> 01:23.533
So, what's
the problem?
Oh, I wasn't finished.

01:23.566 --> 01:24.433
Well, what
happened next?

01:24.466 --> 01:26.033
DAN: I'll tells you
what happens next.

01:26.066 --> 01:27.666
Some black gals joined in
on the protest,

01:27.700 --> 01:29.166
but they got mad
at the white girls
protesting,

01:29.200 --> 01:32.666
because womens of colors
didn't receive the same
supports on similar issues.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.233
I think I see where
you're going with this.

01:34.266 --> 01:35.866
Well, did something
happen even after that?

01:35.900 --> 01:37.233
DAN: Something
did happen after that.

01:37.266 --> 01:40.000
One of the white gals
asking for supports
got supports from one guy,

01:40.033 --> 01:41.400
but she told him
he could fuck right off

01:41.433 --> 01:44.233
because apparently he used
to call gals "broads"
back in high schools.

01:44.266 --> 01:46.933
But they are tweeting
about not tweeting.
Do I have that right?

01:46.966 --> 01:48.966
I got a feeling something
even happened after that.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.266
Yeah, me too, Dary.
Me too. I got that
same feeling.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.633
Well, here's what happened
even after that.

01:53.666 --> 01:54.966
The President of Iceland
sends out

01:55.000 --> 01:57.266
a happy birthday tweet
to his daughter, Alfheiour.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.200
And now all the gals
saying that you
shouldn't be tweetings

01:59.233 --> 02:01.200
turns hims into
public enemy number one.

02:01.233 --> 02:02.966
And it's on Twitter
they're doing that?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.600
And to the President
of Iceland,
they're doing that?

02:05.633 --> 02:08.166
Icelanders are the most
lovable fucking people
on planet Earth.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.866
One more thing
even happens,
so help me God.

02:10.900 --> 02:13.600
So help me God.
Something else
did happen after that,

02:13.633 --> 02:16.100
because it turns out
the President of Iceland's
daughter, Alfheiour,

02:16.133 --> 02:18.233
has got herself a case
of the Down syndromes.

02:18.266 --> 02:20.166
So here comes the Special
Olympics advocates,

02:20.200 --> 02:21.733
and they're
in a real bad way.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.100
As they should be.

02:23.133 --> 02:25.766
If you wanna go at Iceland,
you better have your fucking
facts right.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.733
Well, here's the kicker,
turns out the President of
Iceland's daughter, Alfheiour,

02:28.766 --> 02:31.966
is also a refugee
from war‐torn Somalia
what he's adopted.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.600
So that increases
the tension between

02:33.633 --> 02:34.800
the womens of colors
not tweeting

02:34.833 --> 02:36.533
and the white gals
not tweeting.

02:36.566 --> 02:38.166
To top it all off,
here comes World Vision,

02:38.200 --> 02:39.733
and they're
coming in a'swinging.

02:39.766 --> 02:43.133
Fuck every duck.
What next?

02:43.166 --> 02:44.300
Oh, here's what
happened after that.

02:44.333 --> 02:47.000
Remember that first guy
that they told
to fucks right off

02:47.033 --> 02:49.600
'cause he used to
call gals "broads"
back in high school?

02:49.633 --> 02:51.866
Turns out he's paralyzed
from the waist down.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.966
So here comes the war amps
saying, "You better back
the fuck off our guy."

02:55.000 --> 02:56.033
Enough's enough.

02:56.066 --> 02:57.233
I can't handle anymore.

02:57.266 --> 02:59.866
Well, there's no way
there's more.
There's no goddamn way.

02:59.900 --> 03:02.000
Wait. There is more.

03:02.033 --> 03:03.633
Turns out the President
of Icelands

03:03.666 --> 03:05.533
is paralyzed from
the necks down,

03:05.566 --> 03:07.733
so now everybody's back
on Iceland's sides again.

03:07.766 --> 03:09.833
Oh, right where
they should've been
the whole fucking time.

03:09.866 --> 03:12.800
Now, it's from the neck down
that he's paralyzed, you say?

03:12.833 --> 03:14.300
So, how does he
even make a tweet?

03:14.333 --> 03:15.866
And they're all
doing this on Twitter?

03:15.900 --> 03:17.733
Where else but Twitter
would this be happenings?

03:17.766 --> 03:19.533
On the day they're not
exposed to be tweeting?

03:19.566 --> 03:21.533
On the very same day
they're not exposed
to be tweeting.

03:22.033 --> 03:23.833
ALL: Jesus!

03:27.100 --> 03:29.833
DAN: (GASPING)
Look what's happening
in local news!

03:30.566 --> 03:31.966
ALL: What?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.600
Stay tuned to find out.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

03:46.233 --> 03:48.800
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

04:43.900 --> 04:46.633
Well, the Letterkenny Chiefs
is changing their names
and logos.

04:46.666 --> 04:48.300
That sounds
about right.
Probably for the best.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.400
They had a good run.

04:49.433 --> 04:53.166
The only constant in life
is change, as they say.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.766
"The only constant
in life is change"?

04:57.800 --> 04:59.966
It's a wee bit to wrap
your head around there.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.900
Well, the only constant
around here is everything
stays the sames.

05:02.933 --> 05:04.666
Any‐who...

05:04.700 --> 05:06.633
According to the writers
of the Letterkenny Banner,

05:06.666 --> 05:08.600
the whole world's going to
hells in a hand baskets.

05:08.633 --> 05:09.833
DARYL: Sounds
about right.

05:09.866 --> 05:11.266
KATY: Probably
for the best.
WAYNE: We had a good run.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.966
As long as we're
going in a hand basket.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.033
As opposed to
what kind of basket?

05:16.066 --> 05:18.133
Well, there's a bazillion
different kinds of baskets.

05:18.166 --> 05:20.933
Hand and waste paper.
What else?

05:20.966 --> 05:24.033
Okay, so maybe
there's not a bazillion
different kinds, but...

05:24.066 --> 05:25.700
Yeah, it's
definitely not a bazillion
different kinds...

05:25.733 --> 05:26.766
Yeah, that's what
I just said,

05:26.800 --> 05:28.233
"There's not a bazillion
different kinds of baskets."

05:28.266 --> 05:30.733
Well, don't come in here
saying "bazillion" unless
you mean a bazillion...

05:30.766 --> 05:32.233
Okay. I was just for
emphasis. I was saying,

05:32.266 --> 05:33.800
"Bazillion different
kinds of baskets."

05:33.833 --> 05:35.200
Go ahead and name
five kinds of baskets

05:35.233 --> 05:37.033
besides hands
and waste paper.

05:37.066 --> 05:38.100
Okay. Floor basket,

05:38.133 --> 05:40.133
hanging basket,
wall basket,

05:40.166 --> 05:41.933
bike basket,
basketball basket.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.066
All right.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.566
I withdraw.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.966
Bamboo bakset,
britan bakset,
liquor bakset.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.100
Bakset?

05:51.133 --> 05:52.800
Yes, that's one of
two words that Dary
can't say right.

05:52.833 --> 05:54.600
What's the other
one, Dary?
Brefekst.

05:54.633 --> 05:56.533
Yeah, Dary can't say
the word "breakfast" either.

05:56.566 --> 05:58.133
You wanna
try, bud?
Brefekst. Bakset.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.666
Attaboy.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.166
So, what are they
changing the name to?

06:01.200 --> 06:04.233
According to this, they're
letting the publics decides
with an onlines polls.

06:04.266 --> 06:05.800
Ooh, boy.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.300
Not a
good idea.
Is there a worse idea?

06:08.333 --> 06:11.533
Currently, the Letterkenny
Rough Riders is leading
by a hair.

06:11.566 --> 06:13.100
(WAYNE GRUMBLING)

06:13.133 --> 06:15.066

Or is that you proper?

06:15.100 --> 06:16.233
No, that'd be me proper.

06:16.266 --> 06:17.800
What's the rumpus,
grumpus?

06:17.833 --> 06:20.766
Don't you think that there's
already too many Rough Riders
in the area as it is?

06:20.800 --> 06:22.866
You got
the Redford Rough Riders.
And a one.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.866
You got
the Welno Rough Riders.
And a two.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.833
And don't forget
the Greater Maddawascow
Rough Riders.

06:26.866 --> 06:30.133
And a three. And that's
just off the tippy tops
of our heads.

06:30.166 --> 06:32.100
Does get a bit confusing
during playoffs.

06:32.133 --> 06:33.566
People like to root for
a Rough Rider.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.900
Yeah, but if we're all
going to be Rough Riders,
why even have teams?

06:35.933 --> 06:37.766
Why not just be
a big bunch of
Rough Riders?

06:37.800 --> 06:39.700
Why don't you just
name the whole league
the Rough Riders?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.066
Why even stop there?

06:41.100 --> 06:42.566
Why don't we just go ahead
and name the whole
human race Rough Riders?

06:42.600 --> 06:43.733
Like, you see
what I'm saying.

06:43.766 --> 06:45.833
Yeah. Today,
we're all Rough Riders.

06:45.866 --> 06:47.366
What exactly
is a Rough Rider?

06:47.400 --> 06:50.133
I don't know. All's I'm saying
is that there's too many
of them. Don't you see?

06:50.166 --> 06:51.866
KATY: So, what else
is in the running?

06:51.900 --> 06:54.700

is the Letterkenny
Muff Riders.

06:54.733 --> 06:56.166
Yeah, I can get
behind Muff Riders.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.233
Hmm. What else?

06:57.266 --> 07:00.133
Third place goes to
the Letterkenny
Foot Fuckers.

07:00.166 --> 07:01.533
Shouldn't that be
in first place,

07:01.566 --> 07:03.800
on account that it
has foot in the title,
and it's a soccer team?

07:03.833 --> 07:05.200
What else?

07:05.233 --> 07:09.300
Well, fourth place is a tie
between the Big Nickelbacks
and the 69ers.

(SCOFFS)

09:05.266 --> 09:07.300
We're anarchists.

09:07.333 --> 09:10.166
(SCOFFS) Yeah. Who cares if the
soccer team changes its name?

09:10.200 --> 09:12.200
The hard right, that's who.

09:12.233 --> 09:14.033
Chiefs is a strong name.

09:14.066 --> 09:18.966
I remember a time when
being called a chief
was a good thing.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.866
People like to root for a chief.

09:20.900 --> 09:24.233
(EXCLAIMS)
This used to be the heartland.

09:24.266 --> 09:27.600
Now, it is just the
other heartland

09:27.633 --> 09:30.233
of far‐left liberal cucks.

09:30.266 --> 09:32.833
Did somebody get their
feelings hurt?

09:32.866 --> 09:35.600
Did somebody sign a petition?

09:35.633 --> 09:39.066
Uh, news flash,
you're all caving to PC culture.

09:39.100 --> 09:43.300
You're just a bunch of
far‐left liberal fucking
pinko snowflakes.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.233
Oh, we've been called worse.

09:45.266 --> 09:48.033
But might as well just change
the name to Letterkenny Cucks.

09:48.066 --> 09:51.000
Regional champs
of Cuckistan!
Okay.

09:51.033 --> 09:54.633
This is what the failed
patriarchy looks like.

09:54.666 --> 09:58.233
I'm so sick of you
beta male SJWs.

09:58.266 --> 09:59.700
We're not SJWs.

09:59.733 --> 10:02.066
I actually identify
as a wood nymph.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.533
Super weird.
Be gone.

10:04.566 --> 10:06.266
Oh, we'll be gone.

10:06.300 --> 10:09.233
Just as soon as you betas
show us where the alphas are.

10:09.266 --> 10:13.100
I'll see myself out.
I assume all of you
are following suit.

10:13.133 --> 10:14.133
(SHOUTS)

10:16.333 --> 10:17.666
He talks more than I do.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.033
That was weird.

10:25.633 --> 10:31.033
Ah, yes! Now we're talking.
The alphas. Real men.

10:31.066 --> 10:32.766
No matriarchy in sight.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.133
Who the fuck are you?

10:34.166 --> 10:37.833
I'm Hard Right Jay,
and I represent the Hard Right,

10:37.866 --> 10:40.266
a group with
far‐right ideologies

10:40.300 --> 10:44.733
that rejects mainstream
conservatism and endeavors to
promote white nationalism.

10:44.766 --> 10:46.200
Oh, white nationalism?

10:46.233 --> 10:48.600
Good thing Gail,
the owner of the old bars
ain't here.

10:48.633 --> 10:53.633
Oh, small town bar owner,
what is she, like a good
sixth‐generation Scottish woman?

10:53.666 --> 10:54.633
No.

10:54.666 --> 10:55.466
What are you's getting on
about over there?

10:55.500 --> 10:57.166
Did you dinks
bring these dudes here?

10:57.200 --> 10:59.133
What's the first
meal of the day,
Daryl?

10:59.166 --> 11:00.700
Your mom.
Attaboy.

11:00.733 --> 11:01.833
Breakfast!

11:01.866 --> 11:05.533
Ah, that's it, right.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah, yeah.

11:05.566 --> 11:07.866
Run away like true socialistas.

11:07.900 --> 11:11.966
At least your actions
are consistent with
your failed ideologies.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.800
You edgelords
are a walking horde
of participation trophies.

11:15.833 --> 11:18.666
Go back to giving out
hand jobs for free.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.766
We're not socialistas.
I'm still with her.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.200
We're anarchists.
And our hand jobs aren't free.

11:29.333 --> 11:30.866
So...

11:31.566 --> 11:32.566
Forg...

11:33.266 --> 11:35.233
Forgive...

11:35.266 --> 11:38.300
Forgive them. They don't
see the big picture. Yet.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.433
What's the big picture?

11:39.466 --> 11:42.600
You wanna see how deep
this rabbit hole really goes?

11:42.633 --> 11:44.666
Or are you guys globalists?

11:44.700 --> 11:46.900
What's that?
Ah!

11:46.933 --> 11:49.266
I'll admit, I was anticipating

11:49.300 --> 11:53.766
the low energy, country cuck
road show, but you're curious.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.800
Color me glad.

11:55.733 --> 11:56.866
It's time to wake up.

11:56.900 --> 11:59.233
It's time for you to spit out
all of the toxic sludge

11:59.266 --> 12:02.266
you've been spoon fed
by the Ian Hanomansings

12:02.300 --> 12:05.033
and the Gloria Macarenkos
of the world.

12:05.066 --> 12:06.866
We are a movement.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.766
Bowel movement
by the looks of it.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.033
Ah, hachi‐machi,
I like your fire.

12:12.066 --> 12:14.266
We could use more women
in the movement.

12:14.300 --> 12:18.300
We have next to none,
for reasons we can't
quite decode.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.800
Pitter patter.
Yes, pitter patter.

12:20.833 --> 12:23.133
All lives matter.

12:23.166 --> 12:26.133
News flash,
the out of control PC police

12:26.166 --> 12:29.066
are forcing your beloved
Letterkenny Chiefs
to change their name.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.133
Yeah, we caught that.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.966
Yeah, well, we're here
to protest that.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.766
Our legions of brothers
will be joining me

12:34.800 --> 12:36.900
at John Letterkenny Field
later.

12:36.933 --> 12:40.933
And we want you,
the salt of the earth alphas,

12:40.966 --> 12:47.800
the stewards of traditional
morals, traditional values,
the silent majority, to join us.

12:47.833 --> 12:51.700
The fight against poor,
uneducated libtards

12:51.733 --> 12:53.966
requires nothing short
of a massacre.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.666
Now you're a bit
fucking dramatic, eh?

12:55.700 --> 12:58.266
Why is keeping the name
of the Chiefs important to you?

12:58.300 --> 13:01.600
ALL: It isn't.
Oh, oh, it's not. It isn't?

13:01.633 --> 13:04.033
Well, not really,
in the long run.
Nor the short run, really.

13:04.066 --> 13:06.166
Yeah, no need to get your
jimmies all out of joint.

13:06.200 --> 13:10.900
Well, but you... You understand
why it's important
to fight the left? Yes?

13:10.933 --> 13:13.100
I didn't know it was necessary,
much less important.

13:13.133 --> 13:16.766
The point is
the government
is trying to keep you

13:16.800 --> 13:20.733
and your humble agricultural
livelihoods thoroughly cucked.

13:20.766 --> 13:23.066
It's time to wake up
and smell the chem trails.

13:23.100 --> 13:26.533
It's time to stand up
for your God given right

13:26.566 --> 13:29.200
to have kick‐ass names
for all your favorite teams,

13:29.233 --> 13:32.200
and fuck anybody whose feelings
get hurt along the way.

13:32.233 --> 13:33.666
Oh, is that what time it is?

13:33.700 --> 13:36.533
Oh, you think I don't have
feelings? You think my feelings
don't get hurt?

13:36.566 --> 13:39.833
My grandfather has
a pacemaker, right?

13:39.866 --> 13:42.600
Every time I watch
the Indiana Pacers
play basketball,

13:42.633 --> 13:44.133
it makes me think of Papi.

13:44.166 --> 13:48.066
And his irregular heartbeat.
And it fucks me up, big time.

13:48.100 --> 13:52.100
You see me complaining
to the Indiana Pacers
or anyone in the NBA?

13:52.133 --> 13:53.933
Mmm, suck it up, buttercup.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.066
So?
So what?

13:55.100 --> 13:56.100
So join us.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.733
Tell you what.
I'll fight you for it.
You and me.

14:03.766 --> 14:05.533
Sorry, what?
What I'm saying is,

14:06.666 --> 14:07.933
I'll fight you.

14:07.966 --> 14:10.100
And if you win I'll come
to the field with you.

14:10.133 --> 14:13.033
But if you lose,
we're not asking for
anything in return.

14:13.900 --> 14:17.133
Ah, you SJWs are a lost cause.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.200
I'm going to troll!

14:20.233 --> 14:23.700
Letterkenny Chiefs!
Letterkenny Chiefs!

14:25.633 --> 14:26.566
We can do this, buddy.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.166
We can establish order,
buddy. I know we can.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.200
HARD RIGHT JAY:
Of course you can.

14:30.733 --> 14:32.466
(INHALES) Ah.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.033
Hockey, eh?

14:34.066 --> 14:35.633
Fastest sport on Earth.

14:35.666 --> 14:40.533
And the whitest too, arguably,
so bonus points there.

14:40.566 --> 14:43.066
Okay, the Catholic school games
are on the other rink.

14:43.100 --> 14:47.300
Uh, we just, uh,
thought you strapping alphas

14:47.333 --> 14:49.933
might want to know
that the globalists

14:49.966 --> 14:54.333
are trying to turn your
small town into a hive

14:54.366 --> 14:56.266
of post‐castrati extremism.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.933
What the fuck's castrati?

14:57.966 --> 14:59.366
Uh, it's a pasta, bro.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.066
Uh, it's pronounced
"pah‐sta," bro.
Is it?

15:02.100 --> 15:06.366
Today, it's the Letterkenny
Chiefs. Tomorrow, it'll be
your beloved Shamrocks.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.233
Well, you know, the Chiefs
is kinda not PC though, buddy.

15:09.266 --> 15:12.266
We try to keep it, like,
kind of in touch there.

15:12.300 --> 15:16.266
What if they decide to get
butt hurt over the Letterkenny
Shamrocks name next

15:16.300 --> 15:18.033
and force you to change it

15:18.066 --> 15:22.400
just because they don't know
how to control their... Their
fragile beta male emotions?

15:22.433 --> 15:23.766
What then, huh?

15:23.800 --> 15:27.266
You don't see a bunch
of Irish people protesting
here, do you?

15:27.300 --> 15:28.666
No, you don't.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.100
They're not,
(IMITATING IRISH ACCENT) "Argh,
please change your name!"

15:31.133 --> 15:33.466
None of that's happening.
You wanna know why?

15:33.500 --> 15:36.666
Because Irish people don't
fucking complain about
anything, all right?

15:36.700 --> 15:40.400
Irish people know how to
take it like a champ, okay?

15:40.433 --> 15:43.133
You take their potatoes away,
they don't say a fucking thing.

15:43.166 --> 15:45.133
It's pronounced
"po‐tah‐to."
Is it?

15:45.166 --> 15:48.266
It's called "manning up,"
gentlemen. You might want
to look into it.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.066
What do you think, buddy?

15:52.100 --> 15:53.166
I think this guy's
a goof, buddy.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.433
Cool, buddy.
Yeah, but...

15:55.466 --> 15:59.533
On that note, I'm not really
a fan of the Shamrocks name.

15:59.566 --> 16:00.866
‐Really?
‐Yeah.

16:00.900 --> 16:04.666
Me too, buddy. I mean,
if we're talking about
some kind of negative

16:04.700 --> 16:06.633
stereotype attached
to that name, you know?

16:06.666 --> 16:09.000
Right? It's like,
just because
my name is Reilly,

16:09.033 --> 16:11.200
that doesn't necessarily mean
that I'm a drunken leprechaun.

16:11.233 --> 16:12.533
Maybe we should change
the name, buddy.

16:12.566 --> 16:13.666
(CLICKING TONGUE)

16:13.700 --> 16:15.533
What's this about a name change?

16:15.566 --> 16:18.066
If anybody should
change their names,
it should be us.

16:18.100 --> 16:21.000
What the hell's a
Shamrockette anyway?
A leaf with tits?

16:21.033 --> 16:23.633
Oh, this isn't your
matriarch, is it?

16:23.666 --> 16:28.300
You can't just add "ette" to
the end of the men's team
and expect women to like it.

16:28.333 --> 16:31.633
We should change our names
to something fierce and feminine
and powerful.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.300
Like the Screaming Banshees.

16:34.333 --> 16:38.233
That's good, Mary‐Anne.
Impressive creativity.

16:38.266 --> 16:40.233
Couple of hens clucking away.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.966
Especially for a girl who
had to start kindergarten
two years late

16:43.000 --> 16:45.100
because she couldn't
grasp coloring.

16:45.133 --> 16:47.133
I've plenty of good ideas,
Betty‐Anne.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.933
Like convincing your dad
to get a vasectomy

16:48.966 --> 16:52.533
so I wouldn't have to worry
about another you coming into
the world while I fucked him.

16:52.566 --> 16:54.600
We were just starting
to get them under control.

16:54.633 --> 16:57.966
You're screwing it up, bro.
You're getting them all
fired up again.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.266
Bringing family into it now,
Mary‐Anne? I would never
stoop so low,

17:01.300 --> 17:03.500
especially with the
recent passing of your mother,

17:03.533 --> 17:06.700
who told me before she died
that my dad is your dad too.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.466
You're fucking up
our progress, man.
Just get out of here.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.500
It's only gonna get worse too.
Thanks a lot.

17:12.533 --> 17:15.500
Ah, these Tumblrinas
have lost the plot anyway.

17:15.533 --> 17:18.600
Letterkenny Chiefs!
Letterkenny Chiefs!
(SIGHS)

17:21.233 --> 17:24.500
Where the fuck is everybody?
This is supposed to be
a protest.

17:24.533 --> 17:29.100
We need people to protest
and piss off and agitate.

17:29.133 --> 17:32.133
Ay, ay, ay. Whose idea was this
stupid name change anyway?

17:32.166 --> 17:33.166
TANIS: Ours.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.100
S'up, Nazis?

17:36.133 --> 17:38.466
Nazi? Hilarious.

17:40.966 --> 17:42.400
Ain't nothing funny
about this, honky.

17:42.433 --> 17:44.666
No, but Nazi, really? Nazi?

17:44.700 --> 17:48.100
Would a Nazi ride
a Yamaha scooter?

17:48.133 --> 17:49.633
A pansy Nazi? Sure.

17:49.666 --> 17:52.066
Would a Nazi have
a Jew for a lawyer?

17:52.100 --> 17:55.100
Could you refer me, asshole?
'Cause I'm gonna need one
in a minute.

17:55.133 --> 17:58.433
Would a Nazi own a game‐worn
Tim Duncan jersey?

17:58.466 --> 18:01.066
You sniff that shit before
bed at night, cupcake?

18:01.100 --> 18:06.433
Would a Nazi's favorite snacks
include ramen, pad thai, or pho?

18:06.466 --> 18:08.600
It's pronounced "pho‐e,"
"Pho‐e," dummy.

18:08.633 --> 18:10.066
Oh.

18:10.100 --> 18:14.033
All right, would a Nazi
get turned on by
interracial gang bang porn?

18:14.066 --> 18:15.133
Who fucking doesn't?

18:15.166 --> 18:17.533
All right, I think we all
need to chill out here.

18:17.566 --> 18:19.200
We're getting
ahead of ourselves.

18:19.233 --> 18:21.200
We are an inclusive movement.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.466
I think you should join us.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.633
Is that what we should do?

18:24.666 --> 18:25.700
Yes.

18:25.733 --> 18:27.966
Think about it, Sacagawea.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.333
(STAMMERING) We share a lot.
We have a lot in common.

18:31.366 --> 18:35.600
We both pride ourselves
on traditional values,
traditional morals.

18:35.633 --> 18:39.933
We share a very
anti‐immigration stance.

18:39.966 --> 18:43.333
You know, if you think about it,
we actually share a lot
of common ground.

18:43.366 --> 18:46.500
(SCOFFS) Historically,
sharing ground hasn't
been your strong suit.

18:46.533 --> 18:50.533
If you guys are here,
then who's jerking off
in your mom's basement?

18:50.566 --> 18:53.433
Somewhere there's a
men's rights meeting
missing their door greeters.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.633
Yeah, look. I get it.
You're frustrated.

18:55.666 --> 18:59.400
It must be really exhausting
never paying taxes
your whole lives.

18:59.433 --> 19:03.400
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

19:03.433 --> 19:06.033
All right.
Enough chin‐wagging.

19:06.066 --> 19:09.000
Another hen cluck,
cluck, clucking away.

19:09.033 --> 19:12.566
Hey, no one had a problem
with this. No one had a problem
until you's came to town.

19:12.600 --> 19:16.033
That's it. The Hard Right,
coming to a town near you.

19:16.066 --> 19:18.066
Yeah, we didn't come here
to counter‐protest.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.700
Ain't nothing peaceful
gonna happen today.

19:19.733 --> 19:21.366
Hey, we don't
practice violence.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.066
We do.
We don't practice violence.

19:24.733 --> 19:26.533
But we are prepared for it.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.633
All right. Let's go then.
Let's do this.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.466
You and what army?

19:31.033 --> 19:32.033
That one.

19:33.300 --> 19:37.033
(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)

19:44.400 --> 19:45.400
(INAUDIBLE)

21:07.200 --> 21:08.933
Golden pastures from here.

21:08.966 --> 21:10.000
It's all I see.

21:10.033 --> 21:12.366
Nary a chem trail in the sky.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.933
Possibility of
a gentle Nor'Wester.

21:13.966 --> 21:15.633
Oh, three to five clicks
by the look of her.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.500
(ALL BANG TABLE)

21:20.533 --> 21:22.633
Well, times to check in
on the Letterkenny Banner.

21:22.666 --> 21:24.000
What's the latest?

21:24.033 --> 21:25.700
(DAN GRUMBLING)

21:25.733 --> 21:28.000
Was that your tummy grumbling
or was that you proper?

21:28.033 --> 21:29.600
That was my tummy.
Good enough.

21:29.633 --> 21:32.166
Well, it looks like they
canceled the online polls
to pick the new team name.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.433
Oh, is that what they did?

21:33.466 --> 21:35.533
Yeah, it seems like the
Muff Riders was
runnings away with it.

21:35.566 --> 21:38.966
Foot Fuckers made
more sense by far.
I'm disappointed.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.233
What are they
going with instead?

21:40.266 --> 21:42.000
Rough Riders.
Of course they are.

21:42.033 --> 21:43.166
Playoffs start next week.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.000
Who they playing?
Runforough Rough Riders.

21:45.033 --> 21:46.033
That's gonna be
a really good game.

21:46.066 --> 21:47.966
DARYL: Must be hard kicking
the ball in the snow.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.266
My money's on the Rough Riders.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.400
You're crazy. I got the
Rough Riders by a mile.

21:51.433 --> 21:52.333
Care to make it interesting?

21:52.366 --> 21:54.200
DAN: I'll put ten bucks
on the Rough Riders.

21:54.233 --> 21:55.700
Make it twenty.
I'll take that.

21:55.733 --> 21:56.900
I'm in too.

21:56.933 --> 21:59.300
DAN: See, Wayne, people love
to cheer for a rough rider.

21:59.333 --> 22:01.633
The world's going to hell
in a hand basket, big brother.

22:02.466 --> 22:03.966
In a what, Dary?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.433
Brefekst bakset.
Attaboy.
