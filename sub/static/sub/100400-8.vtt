WEBVTT

01:43.420 --> 01:45.632
Hey! It's JJ. I don't listen
to my voicemails.

01:45.656 --> 01:47.166
Text me! Bye!

01:56.733 --> 01:57.777
Here you go.

01:57.801 --> 01:59.078
Still no word, huh?

01:59.102 --> 02:00.713
No.

02:08.779 --> 02:10.356
Could I schedule an appointment?

02:15.285 --> 02:16.829
Can I, uh, sleep here?

02:36.840 --> 02:39.519
This number is no longer in service.

02:44.114 --> 02:45.580
Hey, Eva.

02:49.219 --> 02:52.532
So, he's out of surgery,
stable, and in the ICU.

02:52.556 --> 02:53.766
Okay.

02:53.790 --> 02:55.390
- Thank you, thank you, thank you!
- Oh. Okay.

02:56.393 --> 02:57.525
All right.

02:59.196 --> 03:02.318
We'll try to wean Vasquez off
the ventilator in a few hours.

03:02.342 --> 03:03.810
It was touch and go,

03:03.834 --> 03:07.513
but that work you did,
you saved his life.

03:07.537 --> 03:09.081
You hear me?

03:09.105 --> 03:11.884
Hey, um, when Webber was caught
drinking on the job,

03:11.908 --> 03:13.437
how did you...

03:13.461 --> 03:16.988
I mean, did you ever consider
not turning him in?

03:17.038 --> 03:18.215
Who's drinking on the job?

03:18.239 --> 03:19.783
I didn't say...

03:19.807 --> 03:22.298
Did you not think
I would crack your master code?

03:22.323 --> 03:23.734
I'm not sure it even happened.

03:23.758 --> 03:25.369
But if it did happen, is...

03:26.064 --> 03:27.471
Is that how Vasquez got hurt?

03:27.495 --> 03:29.240
What? What, what? No, no!

03:29.264 --> 03:31.147
Okay, look, it's not anyone, all right?

03:31.174 --> 03:33.118
Just... It's...
It's probably a counting error.

03:33.142 --> 03:34.286
Counting err...

03:34.310 --> 03:35.888
As in drugs?

03:36.272 --> 03:37.582
I didn't say drugs.

03:37.606 --> 03:38.917
Well, what else would you be counting?

03:38.941 --> 03:39.985
Okay, you know what? You know what?

03:40.009 --> 03:41.019
N-Never mind. Never mind.

03:41.043 --> 03:42.587
I-I'm probably wrong
about the whole thing.

03:42.611 --> 03:44.035
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

03:44.059 --> 03:45.283
No, you shouldn't have.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.453
But if whatever it is that you know

03:47.477 --> 03:49.388
puts you in a bed like Vasquez,

03:49.412 --> 03:52.225
so help me God, Ben Warren...

03:55.452 --> 03:57.296
Is this the longest shift ever?

03:57.320 --> 03:58.664
- Yep.
- Yeah.

03:58.688 --> 04:00.600
I'm ready for it to be over.

04:00.624 --> 04:02.457
Aren't they all 24 hours?

04:05.662 --> 04:06.612
Cereal?

04:06.636 --> 04:07.740
Sorry, princess,

04:07.764 --> 04:09.604
didn't feel like whipping up
omelettes this morning.

04:09.629 --> 04:11.541
Hey, Finch, you know you're a sub?

04:11.565 --> 04:12.575
And subs don't talk?

04:12.599 --> 04:14.499
- Since when?
- Since you became a sub.

04:15.736 --> 04:18.136
Meal rotation for Vasquez's wife.

04:19.471 --> 04:21.873
Warren says he's stable. Thank God.

04:23.125 --> 04:24.569
Hughes. You're on desk duty
the rest of the shift.

04:24.593 --> 04:25.703
I'm what, now?

04:25.727 --> 04:27.105
The rocket incident hit the news.

04:27.129 --> 04:29.607
We have citizens calling in
every loose hubcap they find,

04:29.631 --> 04:32.211
thinking they have evidence
of an alien invasion.

04:32.235 --> 04:34.884
I need someone smart with
people skills to talk them down.

04:35.442 --> 04:39.256
Well, if you're gonna be
all complimentary about it...

04:39.280 --> 04:40.423
fine.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.713
I'll do it.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.995
Finch.

04:45.019 --> 04:47.330
- What? I don't know
- what you think is funny.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.766
I know you and Vasquez were
on B-shift together for a long time.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.234
I can bring in someone else for the OT

04:51.258 --> 04:52.569
if you can't be professional.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.937
No, ma'am.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.272
Job first.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.806
Good.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.863
I would give someone ten million dollars

04:58.888 --> 05:01.066
to disable the alarm
for the rest of our shift.

05:01.090 --> 05:03.335
I don't know. We're really close.

05:03.359 --> 05:05.004
- I think we're gonna make it.
- You better not jinx it.

05:05.028 --> 05:07.606
Engine 19, Ladder 19, Aid 19,

05:07.630 --> 05:09.205
vehicle accident
at 7780 Morris Lake Road.

05:09.229 --> 05:10.676
Yeah! There you go!

05:13.803 --> 05:15.848
Okay.

05:15.872 --> 05:17.716
All right. Hold on a second.
All right, all right.

05:17.740 --> 05:18.951
We got this.

05:18.975 --> 05:20.486
Yeah, that's right.

05:20.510 --> 05:21.987
I know, I know. I know you're hungry.

05:22.011 --> 05:23.844
But crying won't make it come any faster.

05:25.882 --> 05:27.626
Aw, damn it! Damn it!

05:30.080 --> 05:31.581
- Hello?
- Yeah, yeah. Don't...

05:31.606 --> 05:32.658
Don't shake the baby.

05:32.682 --> 05:34.127
Don't shake the baby.
Don't shake the baby.

05:36.213 --> 05:37.957
Special delivery from Station...

05:37.981 --> 05:39.492
She won't eat. She just cries. It's...

05:39.516 --> 05:41.761
Which means she's hungry,
but she won't eat or sleep,

05:41.785 --> 05:43.196
which means that I can't do either.

05:43.220 --> 05:45.265
And I think she's broken. Is it
possible that she's broken?

05:45.289 --> 05:46.378
Sit down. Sit down.
What is wrong with her?

05:46.402 --> 05:47.556
Breathe. I got her.

05:48.992 --> 05:50.103
What's her name?

05:50.127 --> 05:52.172
Son, what's your baby's name?

05:52.196 --> 05:55.397
We've, uh... We've been
calling... calling her TBD.

05:56.934 --> 05:58.778
I'm staying.

06:00.982 --> 06:03.227
I swear, bro. If I have to
listen to McAllister

06:03.251 --> 06:05.496
complain about my reports one more time,

06:05.520 --> 06:07.017
I might set fire to the building.

06:07.041 --> 06:08.407
Right?

06:08.431 --> 06:09.613
Okay.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.201
Can we not talk about work?
For one night. Please?

06:12.226 --> 06:15.272
Aw. Is the boss's son sick
of his cushy little job?

06:15.296 --> 06:16.339
Poor Miller.

06:16.363 --> 06:19.409
Tell us how hard it is to be born rich.

06:19.879 --> 06:20.989
All right.

06:21.013 --> 06:24.159
Um, the diamonds
that I eat for breakfast...

06:24.183 --> 06:25.527
they're starting to scratch my teeth.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.063
And the gold bars I carry around,

06:28.087 --> 06:29.732
they're giving me backaches.

06:31.608 --> 06:32.585
I'm not complaining about

06:32.609 --> 06:35.487
my ruby-studded houseboat, dummies.

06:35.511 --> 06:37.823
I'm just saying...

06:37.847 --> 06:39.325
I don't like the job.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.370
And I... And I don't like that.

06:42.394 --> 06:44.498
Whoa! Hey, what's your problem, bro?

06:44.523 --> 06:46.134
You're in kind of a mood tonight.

06:46.158 --> 06:48.060
He's peeing off the side of my house,

06:48.084 --> 06:49.337
and my mood's the problem?

06:49.361 --> 06:50.605
It's water to water, bro.

06:50.629 --> 06:52.640
You know, it's actually good
for the fish and plant life.

06:52.664 --> 06:55.109
That's actually 100% inaccurate.

06:55.133 --> 06:59.047
I think I got something that,
uh, might improve your mood.

06:59.071 --> 07:00.448
Hey, come on.

07:00.472 --> 07:02.517
Dude, you know I don't...
I don't mess with that crap.

07:02.541 --> 07:04.652
No, I know, but it's never
too late to get started.

07:04.676 --> 07:07.088
Greg, no.

07:07.112 --> 07:08.389
Can we not do that in my house?

07:08.413 --> 07:10.555
But we're not in your house.
We're on the deck.

07:10.580 --> 07:13.159
Yeah. International waters, bro.

07:18.989 --> 07:21.267
Looks like a pickup
truck sped through, spun out,

07:21.291 --> 07:22.834
hit a bunch of bikers.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.037
Bypasser called it in.

07:31.768 --> 07:34.480
Dispatch for Ladder 19, we have a TC.

07:34.504 --> 07:36.874
Pickup truck versus multiple motorcycles.

07:36.899 --> 07:38.710
We have approximately 6 victims.

07:38.734 --> 07:40.745
Requesting 3 additional Aid Cars,

07:40.769 --> 07:42.981
1 Ladder, 1 Engine, and PRT.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.883
SPD for traffic control.

07:44.907 --> 07:46.484
Have the Engine, Ladder, and PRT

07:46.508 --> 07:48.586
approach from the south
on Morris Lake Road,

07:48.610 --> 07:51.623
and tell the Aid Cars to stage
at the north end near Aid 19.

07:51.647 --> 07:54.159
Ladder 19 is Morris Lake Road
Incident Command.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.561
Captain, I count six bikes
and five riders.

08:03.425 --> 08:07.238
Dispatch, correction.
We have at least seven victims.

08:07.262 --> 08:10.122
We anticipate multiple fatalities.

08:10.146 --> 08:14.390
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

08:17.805 --> 08:21.276
I assume there's a reason
you keep refusing surgery.

08:22.109 --> 08:24.588
It, um, might...

08:24.612 --> 08:27.057
complicate my situation at work.

08:27.081 --> 08:28.293
Huh.

08:28.317 --> 08:30.661
If you could give me better odds
than Koracick,

08:30.685 --> 08:32.029
I might change my mind.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.297
I'm a surgeon.

08:33.321 --> 08:35.365
By definition, I like to cut.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.601
But that does not mean
that I will lie to you

08:37.625 --> 08:38.934
to get you on the table.

08:38.958 --> 08:41.860
Yeah, so 50/50 is the best you can do.

08:43.831 --> 08:45.475
I notice that Dr. Koracick

08:45.499 --> 08:48.178
had been prescribing
some pretty heavy opiates.

08:48.202 --> 08:51.181
You should know that I favor
a different approach.

08:51.205 --> 08:54.117
Yeah, I'm familiar with your reputation.

08:58.913 --> 09:02.993
Your reputation is... why I'm here.

09:05.853 --> 09:07.664
You're using more than you'd like.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.267
Yeah.

09:11.906 --> 09:15.138
How much are you taking
on an average day?

09:18.999 --> 09:20.510
Uh...

09:23.304 --> 09:24.964
Write it down.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.384
All of it.

09:27.408 --> 09:31.154
Is that some kind of...
therapy technique or...

09:31.178 --> 09:33.190
I'm not a therapist.

09:33.214 --> 09:34.591
But I am a recovering addict,

09:34.615 --> 09:38.161
and I have gotten a lot of therapy.

09:38.185 --> 09:41.732
And I've learned that there is
no getting over pain...

09:41.756 --> 09:43.133
of any kind...

09:43.157 --> 09:44.968
without telling the truth.

09:47.595 --> 09:49.072
Montgomery, Finch.

09:49.096 --> 09:50.540
Check on the driver of the truck.

09:50.564 --> 09:52.542
Cutler, Dixon,
triage the victims on the road.

09:52.566 --> 09:54.144
Everyone else, recon.

09:54.168 --> 09:56.913
Fan out, walk the scene,
and find every victim.

09:56.937 --> 09:58.415
Herrera and Gibson, take the south.

09:58.439 --> 10:01.051
Aid 19, let them know we have
a mass-casualty incident

10:01.075 --> 10:02.953
and get me ER availability.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.021
Probie... color of triage tags?

10:05.045 --> 10:06.056
- What?
- Come on.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.057
Um...

10:07.081 --> 10:09.259
uh, r-red for immediate,

10:09.283 --> 10:11.995
uh, green for, uh,
non-life-threatening injury,

10:12.019 --> 10:13.163
uh, yellow for, um...

10:13.187 --> 10:14.664
Yellow for delayed
and black for deceased.

10:14.688 --> 10:16.366
Right.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.929
Tag him, Probie.

10:25.099 --> 10:26.643
It does get easier. A little.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.112
I don't need you to baby me.

10:29.136 --> 10:30.614
Okay, then. Enjoy the carnage.

10:34.419 --> 10:35.685
No fuel leaks.

10:35.709 --> 10:37.254
Hey, Finch! Gimme a hand with this door.

10:38.546 --> 10:40.227
On the count of 3. 3.

10:43.117 --> 10:45.762
Smells like he showered
in vodka this morning.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.798
Thank you.

10:49.590 --> 10:51.234
Let's go.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.540
What do we have?

10:56.564 --> 10:58.275
Diminished breath sounds bilaterally.

10:58.299 --> 10:59.543
Steering wheel didn't collapse.

10:59.567 --> 11:00.677
AKA drunk on a stick?

11:00.701 --> 11:02.312
Prep for intubation.

11:02.336 --> 11:03.847
We have five victims on the street,

11:03.871 --> 11:05.115
one confirmed deceased.

11:05.139 --> 11:07.517
Engine 23, I need a staging area
and treatment area.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.620
Ladder 15, find any critical
victims we haven't located.

11:10.644 --> 11:12.989
I'm getting muffled heart sounds now.

11:13.013 --> 11:14.591
Dude's toast.

11:14.615 --> 11:16.426
Finch, swap out with Dixon.

11:16.450 --> 11:17.461
What?

11:17.485 --> 11:19.029
You want Probie on this?

11:19.053 --> 11:20.464
Bishop, that's really rough to do

11:20.488 --> 11:22.032
to someone on a f-first shift.

11:23.691 --> 11:25.669
O Captain, my Captain.

11:32.433 --> 11:34.411
Good morning. Station 19.

11:34.435 --> 11:37.080
How can I help you today?

11:37.104 --> 11:38.882
Well, you'll be happy to hear

11:38.906 --> 11:41.551
that yesterday's crash
was an isolated incident.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.220
No, ma'am.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.488
No, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

11:44.512 --> 11:47.390
I assure you there was
no cover-up of any kind.

11:47.414 --> 11:49.593
Oh, yeah, I watched
that Area 51 special, too.

11:49.617 --> 11:51.528
Yeah, there are plenty of people
with red hair, though.

11:51.552 --> 11:52.829
It's not a sign of anything.

11:52.853 --> 11:54.097
No, thank you for calling.

11:54.121 --> 11:55.165
Mm-hmm.

11:55.189 --> 11:56.388
Sure. Bye.

12:00.861 --> 12:02.372
Hey!

12:02.396 --> 12:04.007
Hey. Hey.

12:04.031 --> 12:07.911
Marina found a bunch of these
in my back closet.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.944
So I just kind of thought I'd come by

12:09.968 --> 12:12.870
and find out why there's
multiple bags of yours

12:12.895 --> 12:14.539
in my... in my back closet.

12:14.563 --> 12:16.730
'Cause it's super roomy.

12:18.066 --> 12:19.410
Uh, right.

12:19.434 --> 12:24.949
Um, well, it's possible
that I may be somewhat...

12:24.973 --> 12:26.017
living at your place.

12:26.041 --> 12:27.118
At my place?

12:27.142 --> 12:29.901
Yeah, just in like a... habitat way.

12:29.925 --> 12:31.325
Not in a relationship way.

12:31.412 --> 12:33.089
What does that even mean?

12:33.113 --> 12:35.091
Well, a relationship way
is like, "Where is this going?"

12:35.115 --> 12:37.894
And a habitat way is, you know,

12:37.918 --> 12:39.129
"I lost my lease,

12:39.153 --> 12:40.930
and I sleep at the station
three nights a week anyway,

12:40.954 --> 12:42.165
so what is the difference, really,

12:42.189 --> 12:43.867
between that and sexy sleepovers,

12:43.891 --> 12:46.091
which I know you like?"

12:47.094 --> 12:48.738
Okay, you... you do realize, though,

12:48.762 --> 12:52.008
you can't move into my apartment
and not tell me, right?

12:52.032 --> 12:54.244
No?

12:54.809 --> 12:56.520
Okay, I'm s... I'm sorry.

12:56.544 --> 12:57.621
I know... I know this looks bad,

12:57.645 --> 12:59.189
and I'm sorry,
and I should've said something,

12:59.213 --> 13:00.357
but it's only a few nights a week,

13:00.381 --> 13:02.426
and, you know, I did not...

13:02.450 --> 13:03.862
I didn't think you'd find out.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.120
How are you making it worse?

13:06.144 --> 13:07.354
I, um...

13:07.378 --> 13:08.722
I really like you.

13:08.746 --> 13:09.857
I really like you.

13:09.881 --> 13:11.091
This is just a lot.
It's kind of too much.

13:11.115 --> 13:12.192
Um...

13:12.216 --> 13:13.683
Oh, you know what? Um...

13:14.819 --> 13:16.263
Hold, please.

13:16.287 --> 13:18.098
People think that
there's an alien invasion,

13:18.122 --> 13:19.466
so I actually have to get that.

13:19.490 --> 13:20.801
Okay, sure. Yeah.

13:20.825 --> 13:23.125
Okay, uh, can we talk later, though?

13:24.095 --> 13:25.905
I guess... I guess
we can talk later, yeah.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.808
I'll be at the hospital.

13:30.069 --> 13:31.501
Can't wait.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.782
She's known you for 30 seconds,
and she already loves you.

13:52.815 --> 13:54.559
She doesn't love me. She loves formula.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.629
I've been trying
to give her formula all night,

13:56.653 --> 13:57.963
and she won't take it!

13:57.987 --> 13:59.432
Maybe it's like bees.

13:59.456 --> 14:01.233
She can smell my fear.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.235
The whole block can smell your fear, son.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.403
Take a breath.

14:04.893 --> 14:07.160
JJ left.

14:10.892 --> 14:11.935
For how long?

14:11.959 --> 14:13.070
Forever, I guess?

14:13.094 --> 14:15.773
She's gone. She disconnected her phone.

14:15.797 --> 14:17.296
She left us.

14:22.003 --> 14:23.614
Dude!

14:23.638 --> 14:25.113
Look at these creamy calves.

14:25.138 --> 14:26.549
Ah! I could totally make this jump!

14:26.573 --> 14:27.617
Yeah, you could, bro!

14:27.641 --> 14:28.751
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! Wait, wait!

14:28.775 --> 14:29.919
What are you doing?

14:29.943 --> 14:31.487
The only thing you're gonna do
is get yourself killed

14:31.511 --> 14:33.055
and mess up
my homeowner's insurance, man.

14:33.079 --> 14:34.257
- Just chill.
- Holy moly.

14:34.281 --> 14:36.359
Why are you such a buzzkill, Miller?

14:36.384 --> 14:38.229
Yeah! Who made you like this? Your mom?

14:38.253 --> 14:39.730
Hey, I don't care how high you are, Tom.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.232
- Step off my mom.
- Hey, hey, look.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.701
I just got one question, okay?

14:43.725 --> 14:45.736
Why do you hate fun, Miller?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.638
Yeah, Miller. Why do you hate fun?

14:48.329 --> 14:50.775
U-Uh, uh, I don't...

14:51.057 --> 14:52.634
I don't hate fun, okay?

14:52.658 --> 14:54.737
I just don't like drugs.

14:54.761 --> 14:55.838
Or lawsuits.

14:55.862 --> 14:58.357
Or either of you, to be honest.

14:58.382 --> 15:00.227
And I'm gonna remember that next weekend.

15:00.251 --> 15:02.029
Hey, okay, what...
what do you like, then?

15:02.053 --> 15:04.331
I mean, you hate the job. You hate fun.

15:04.355 --> 15:05.499
So what do you like, bro?

15:08.685 --> 15:10.296
Whoa, bro.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.731
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

15:11.755 --> 15:15.068
My chest kinda... hurts.

15:16.076 --> 15:17.570
Oh! Oh, God!

15:17.594 --> 15:18.971
Greg!

15:18.995 --> 15:21.074
How far can a bike throw a rider?

15:21.098 --> 15:23.543
It depends on how fast the truck
was going that hit him.

15:23.567 --> 15:24.944
H-Help!

15:24.968 --> 15:26.712
H-Help!

15:26.736 --> 15:28.781
Help! Over here!

15:28.805 --> 15:30.149
Over here!

15:30.173 --> 15:33.119
Sir! Seattle Fire Department.
We're coming to you.

15:33.143 --> 15:34.736
Okay. Thanks.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.989
My wife, I c... I can't see her.

15:37.013 --> 15:38.357
She...

15:38.381 --> 15:40.460
She was riding behind me.

15:42.698 --> 15:44.075
I got a patient in a tree.

15:44.099 --> 15:46.811
I'm gonna need a ladder and at
least two extra sets of hands.

15:47.936 --> 15:50.582
His breaths have been getting shallower.

15:52.107 --> 15:54.552
IC from Engine 19,
we have three more victims

15:54.576 --> 15:57.222
here in the south end
in need of medical attention.

15:57.246 --> 15:59.491
Request assistance on a pinned patient.

15:59.515 --> 16:00.758
Engine 19, Roger.

16:00.782 --> 16:03.094
Engine 23, assist Engine 19
with patient care,

16:03.118 --> 16:05.073
south side of Morris Lake Road.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.451
His chest...

16:07.475 --> 16:09.553
- We need to tube him, Probie.
- Me?

16:09.577 --> 16:11.355
Montgomery, lower the seat back
so that Probie can work.

16:11.379 --> 16:13.690
- You're not gonna do an extrication?
- Does he have a pulse?

16:15.550 --> 16:17.961
- Barely.
- GCS score?

16:17.985 --> 16:19.263
- Uh...
- Less than eight.

16:19.287 --> 16:21.231
And what do we do when a patient
is minimally responsive?

16:21.255 --> 16:23.367
Protect the airway.

16:28.228 --> 16:29.772
What's your name, sir?

16:29.796 --> 16:30.973
I'm... I'm Nate.

16:30.997 --> 16:33.409
Nate, I'm Andy. Just look straight ahead.

16:33.433 --> 16:35.478
You might want to keep an eye
on those breath sounds.

16:35.502 --> 16:38.114
Sir, someone's coming
to help you in a minute.

16:38.138 --> 16:40.449
Don't worry about me.
I'm just trying to help.

16:40.473 --> 16:42.752
Where's my wife? D-Did you find her?

16:42.776 --> 16:43.953
My partner's taking care of her.

16:43.977 --> 16:45.855
Let me help you. Are you in any pain?

16:45.879 --> 16:46.956
Uh, no, not really.

16:46.980 --> 16:48.891
I-I can't even feel my arms and legs.

16:48.915 --> 16:50.526
I must be in shock.

16:50.550 --> 16:53.529
Yeah, that... that can happen.

16:55.856 --> 16:57.300
What's that?

16:57.324 --> 16:58.668
That's my partner helping your wife.

16:58.692 --> 16:59.602
You found her?

16:59.626 --> 17:02.038
Lisa? Lisa, can you hear me?!

17:02.062 --> 17:03.973
Hey, I need you to stay calm, okay?

17:03.997 --> 17:05.540
Moving is very bad right now.

17:05.565 --> 17:08.444
We got this, buddy.
Lisa is gonna be fine.

17:08.468 --> 17:11.380
May be a few months before we
can make that Williamsburg trip,

17:11.404 --> 17:12.647
but we'll make it.

17:12.672 --> 17:14.183
She doesn't even like to ride.

17:14.207 --> 17:17.553
I was like, "We've been married
for twenty years.

17:17.577 --> 17:19.922
Half of my friends in the club
think I made you up."

17:19.945 --> 17:22.592
My partner's got her.
They're taking care of her.

17:22.616 --> 17:23.915
She's okay?

17:26.752 --> 17:28.698
She's okay, Nate.

17:28.722 --> 17:29.866
Oh, thank God.

17:29.890 --> 17:31.067
Lisa!

17:31.091 --> 17:33.436
If you can hear me, I love you!

17:39.238 --> 17:41.911
PRT 19 from Engine 19,
what's your twenty?

17:41.936 --> 17:43.066
On your 6:00.

17:43.090 --> 17:44.368
Two adult males.

17:44.392 --> 17:45.669
I've got a thoracic injury.

17:45.693 --> 17:46.970
Breaths are slow and shallow.

17:46.994 --> 17:47.971
Could be pneumothorax.

17:47.995 --> 17:49.405
And a possible head injury there.

17:50.164 --> 17:51.842
My guess is it's a rib injury,

17:51.866 --> 17:52.876
punctured a lung.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.578
Common injury in older bikers

17:54.602 --> 17:56.813
because of... rib position
and bone density.

17:56.837 --> 17:59.216
- What are you, an ER doc?
- Plastics.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.107
I shave bumps of noses.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.124
My ex always hated me riding.

18:03.148 --> 18:05.793
Was always sending me links
about what could go wrong,

18:05.817 --> 18:07.929
saying, uh, "You're not
a young man anymore, Steve.

18:07.953 --> 18:09.030
See attached."

18:09.054 --> 18:10.665
She was big on "See attached."

18:10.689 --> 18:11.966
Steve Charnofsky, M.D.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.334
Dr. Ben Warren.

18:13.358 --> 18:14.302
Doctor?

18:14.326 --> 18:15.670
What are you doing out here?

18:15.694 --> 18:17.505
- Helping you.
- Ah.

18:17.529 --> 18:18.873
Okay.

18:19.201 --> 18:20.979
Steve, you are nice and stable,

18:21.003 --> 18:22.414
but I'm gonna have to go get a gurney

18:22.438 --> 18:23.715
to transport you with that leg.

18:23.739 --> 18:25.884
Just to be on the safe side,
let's get you a, uh...

18:25.908 --> 18:27.052
C-Collar.

18:27.076 --> 18:28.920
- You got it.
- Hey.

18:28.944 --> 18:30.422
Let's get this helmet off.

18:32.281 --> 18:33.600
You good?

18:33.625 --> 18:35.303
Yeah. Steve and I got this.

18:35.327 --> 18:36.971
Can't believe this happened.

18:36.995 --> 18:38.773
We were on a sunrise ride.

18:38.797 --> 18:40.407
There were nine of us.

18:42.334 --> 18:43.578
How many dead?

18:43.602 --> 18:45.180
Command from PRT 19.

18:45.204 --> 18:47.184
We have three patients.

18:47.209 --> 18:50.488
We are handling with Engine 19,
Engine 23, and PRT 19.

18:50.512 --> 18:51.956
How many more do you have?

18:51.980 --> 18:54.163
Five, plus the driver of the truck.

18:54.188 --> 18:56.566
We may have one more rider
we haven't found yet.

18:56.609 --> 18:58.554
You Doctors Without Borders or something?

18:58.578 --> 18:59.788
Physician Response Team.

18:59.812 --> 19:01.390
I got a truck up the street

19:01.414 --> 19:02.691
with an entire operating suite in it.

19:02.715 --> 19:04.031
- No way!
- Uh-huh.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.861
I always wanted to join
Doctors Without Borders.

19:05.885 --> 19:07.963
I always figured I'd do it
later, after I retired.

19:07.987 --> 19:10.844
But, oh, sitting here... Oof.

19:10.868 --> 19:13.102
I became a doctor to help people.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.754
Now I do butt lifts.

19:14.778 --> 19:18.525
Doctors Without Borders
is an excellent goal.

19:18.549 --> 19:19.959
And you got plenty of time yet.

19:19.983 --> 19:22.584
Just sit tight, and I'll be right back.

19:25.089 --> 19:27.133
Got one more.

19:41.828 --> 19:43.305
Sir, my name is Captain Bishop.

19:43.329 --> 19:44.974
I'm with the Seattle Fire Department.

19:44.998 --> 19:46.108
- Is there a fire?
- No, sir.

19:46.132 --> 19:47.777
You've been in an accident.
We're gonna help you.

19:47.801 --> 19:50.379
Can you call my boss
and tell him I'm gonna be late?

19:50.403 --> 19:52.782
He hates when I'm late.

19:52.806 --> 19:55.284
Is five minutes
while I get my Pumpkin Spice

19:55.308 --> 19:57.052
going to bring down the company, Dan?

19:59.583 --> 20:01.557
Why are you looking at me like that?

20:01.976 --> 20:03.926
Is something wrong with my face?

20:09.125 --> 20:10.357
Olson!

20:11.360 --> 20:12.839
He was awake, little disoriented.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.106
Then he went out,
but his vitals are stable,

20:14.130 --> 20:15.607
and his pupils are equal and reactive.

20:16.699 --> 20:18.009
Nice job.

20:21.262 --> 20:23.640
You should do this. I-I can't.
There's too much blood.

20:23.664 --> 20:25.601
Okay, this is the job, Probie, okay?

20:25.626 --> 20:26.877
If it was easy,
we wouldn't need the academy.

20:26.901 --> 20:28.278
Come on. Come on.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.111
I got it! I'm in!

20:37.135 --> 20:39.113
Good job. Now bag him.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.687
Now can we do the extrication?

20:48.084 --> 20:50.095
Now that you have him
stabilized, it's not a priority.

20:56.893 --> 20:58.392
Okay.

20:59.829 --> 21:03.742
Okay, you are going to write me
another prescription?

21:03.766 --> 21:07.146
There is a meeting in an hour.

21:07.766 --> 21:08.876
A meeting?

21:08.900 --> 21:09.944
Right downstairs.

21:09.968 --> 21:11.646
Oh.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.347
12 steps, huh?

21:13.372 --> 21:15.250
Yeah, I-I got to get back to work.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.252
You came here because you wanted my help.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.677
For my pain.

21:19.378 --> 21:22.224
I was hoping you could help me
treat my pain

21:22.248 --> 21:23.392
before it becomes a problem.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.267
Becomes a problem?

21:26.419 --> 21:27.629
I'm not an addict.

21:29.989 --> 21:33.392
You are using drugs
just to get through the morning.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.928
You are stealing.

21:34.952 --> 21:36.551
You O.D.'d.

21:38.622 --> 21:40.122
I've been where you are, Robert.

21:41.892 --> 21:43.336
I doubt it.

21:44.561 --> 21:46.906
Which story do you want to hear...

21:47.445 --> 21:49.790
the one where I stole
my brother's prescription pad

21:49.814 --> 21:50.992
so that I could get high?

21:51.016 --> 21:52.994
Or the one about

21:53.018 --> 21:56.097
the man I loved
O.D.'ing in bed next to me

21:56.121 --> 21:58.432
while I was too high to notice?

22:00.692 --> 22:02.393
Take a sick morning.

22:02.417 --> 22:04.639
Because you're sick, Robert.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.018
Because you almost died.

22:07.042 --> 22:09.053
Because you do not want to live
the way you are living.

22:09.077 --> 22:12.488
Because you went from one problem, pain,

22:12.513 --> 22:15.392
to two problems, pain and drugs,

22:15.417 --> 22:19.230
to three problems,
pain and drugs and lies,

22:19.254 --> 22:21.098
and this road is long,

22:21.122 --> 22:22.967
and it is terrible,

22:22.991 --> 22:25.336
and it ends with the people
that you love hurt

22:25.360 --> 22:26.859
and you dead.

22:28.163 --> 22:30.107
And you are the only person

22:30.131 --> 22:32.109
who can stop that from happening.

22:37.205 --> 22:39.658
Hey, Steve. Got your ride.

22:41.527 --> 22:42.637
Hey, Flores!

22:47.132 --> 22:48.276
His pupils are blown. He's not breathing.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.644
Brain bleed?

22:49.668 --> 22:51.568
We got to intubate him
and get him into the PRT now.

22:54.293 --> 22:56.439
Seeing JJ when that baby was born,

22:56.463 --> 22:59.308
when she held her, that was love.

22:59.332 --> 23:00.643
I know it was.

23:00.667 --> 23:04.650
But now she's gone,
and I'm left with this creature

23:04.675 --> 23:06.819
who knows her mom is gone.

23:06.843 --> 23:08.154
She does.

23:08.178 --> 23:11.090
She... She looks at me, and she knows.

23:11.114 --> 23:13.326
Dean. Sincerely.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.344
She can't distinguish you
from that chair.

23:15.368 --> 23:19.715
Having a perfect family unit
doesn't make you a parent.

23:19.739 --> 23:21.709
Loving your kid makes you a parent.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.112
But what if she grows up to hate me?

23:23.136 --> 23:24.346
Oh, she'll definitely hate you.

23:24.370 --> 23:26.148
All teenage girls hate their fathers.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.084
Ah, that's comforting.

23:28.108 --> 23:29.752
I am glad you came.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.388
But they always come back around.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.156
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.086
So, uh... So Andy forgave you?

23:36.160 --> 23:37.204
Mm...

23:37.228 --> 23:38.839
She forgives me,
she gets mad at me again,

23:38.863 --> 23:40.474
she forgives me,
she gets mad at me again.

23:40.498 --> 23:42.676
It's our... thing.

23:44.768 --> 23:48.081
With all due respect, sir,
and no offense intended,

23:48.105 --> 23:49.304
but...

23:51.575 --> 23:53.954
...you literally just told me
you wish you had more time,

23:53.978 --> 23:55.889
but you're not...

23:55.913 --> 23:58.859
you don't seem willing to fight for it.

23:59.421 --> 24:01.561
I just...

24:02.049 --> 24:04.520
I don't blame Andy
for being upset about that.

24:08.364 --> 24:09.575
I'm gonna close these doors

24:09.599 --> 24:12.268
so the baby doesn't hear
the sounds I'm about to make.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.383
"All due respect
and no offense intended"?

24:17.407 --> 24:19.485
Whoa, sir. I did not mean anything by...

24:19.509 --> 24:20.753
I don't give a damn
what you meant, Miller.

24:20.777 --> 24:22.521
Just who the hell do you think you are?

24:24.547 --> 24:25.991
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

24:26.015 --> 24:27.159
Call 911!

24:27.183 --> 24:28.293
But what about...

24:28.317 --> 24:30.195
Do it! Now! Right now! Go!

24:31.587 --> 24:33.489
- 911.
- Yeah, hi.

24:33.514 --> 24:35.392
Um, my friend fell in the water.

24:35.416 --> 24:37.194
- I think he's drowning.
- Is he breathing?

24:37.218 --> 24:38.195
Hold on.

24:38.219 --> 24:39.296
They want to know is he breathing.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.897
Would I be doing CPR if he was breathing?

24:41.313 --> 24:42.357
No?

24:42.381 --> 24:44.826
Uh, no, no, no, no. He's not breathing.

24:44.850 --> 24:46.662
Bro, are you supposed to be
pounding on him like that?

24:46.686 --> 24:48.497
I was a lifeguard in high school.

24:48.521 --> 24:49.731
This is how you do it.

24:49.755 --> 24:50.832
Just don't break his chest bone!

24:50.856 --> 24:52.701
Yeah, yeah, I'm st... I'm still here.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.553
Can you just send help?

24:58.247 --> 25:00.258
Well, the driver's gone. No shock there.

25:00.282 --> 25:02.294
Probie, did you get
the patient intubated?

25:02.318 --> 25:04.429
W... Yeah, but did I screw it up?

25:04.453 --> 25:06.441
Tell him. If you won't, I will.

25:06.465 --> 25:08.400
You took too long. You could've
caused permanent brain damage.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.434
Yep, you might've.

25:09.458 --> 25:10.669
If there was even the slightest chance

25:10.693 --> 25:12.103
he would've survived in the first place.

25:12.127 --> 25:14.172
Wait. You had me intubate a dead patient?

25:14.196 --> 25:15.633
- He wasn't dead.
- Yet.

25:15.657 --> 25:17.075
The steering column was the only thing

25:17.099 --> 25:18.573
holding his thoracic cavity together.

25:18.597 --> 25:20.078
He bled out the minute
you lowered the seat back.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.246
That's why she had you tube him.

25:21.270 --> 25:22.447
Because she knew he wasn't gonna make it.

25:22.471 --> 25:24.879
Wait. So you had me do
an impossible intubation,

25:24.904 --> 25:27.182
thinking that I was holding
a guy's life in my hands

25:27.206 --> 25:28.884
for what, a-a training exercise?

25:28.908 --> 25:31.486
Would you rather have done it on a
patient you could give brain damage?

25:32.778 --> 25:35.891
Look, you got it done, all right?

25:35.915 --> 25:37.726
You learned how to tube
in the field under pressure.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.019
Right. Yeah. No pep talks.

25:44.485 --> 25:47.088
So, we have a few options
for pain management.

25:47.112 --> 25:49.758
A nerve-stimulation device.

25:49.782 --> 25:53.161
It's given a lot of CRPS patients relief.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.155
Is it an implant?

25:55.179 --> 25:57.490
No, it's a sticker
that you put on your leg,

25:57.514 --> 25:59.259
and it delivers
electrical impulses to the nerve

25:59.283 --> 26:01.094
- to shock it.
- Oh, wow.

26:01.518 --> 26:02.628
This one is mine.

26:02.652 --> 26:03.563
Oh.

26:03.587 --> 26:05.353
I can write you a prescription.

26:07.057 --> 26:08.267
What's great about it

26:08.291 --> 26:10.436
is that it keeps your pain management

26:10.460 --> 26:13.005
entirely in your hands.

26:13.029 --> 26:16.064
And you seem like a guy
who likes to be in control.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.745
There's also a class of antidepressants.

26:19.769 --> 26:22.931
Oh, this isn't... depression.

26:22.956 --> 26:26.136
Robert, you are in daily pain
and fighting a drug problem.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.972
If you weren't a little
depressed, I'd be worried.

26:28.996 --> 26:31.007
These are tricyclic antidepressants.

26:31.031 --> 26:33.309
They are a proven treatment
for nerve pain.

26:39.922 --> 26:41.366
No change.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.536
You couldn't have done anything.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.871
He assessed as stable.

26:44.895 --> 26:46.681
I told him he was gonna be okay.

26:46.705 --> 26:48.337
I told him he was gonna get to do good.

26:48.361 --> 26:50.043
Even if you had transported him
right away...

26:50.067 --> 26:51.911
He herniated. I know.

26:51.935 --> 26:55.126
Doesn't make me feel any better
about him being brain dead.

26:55.150 --> 26:57.470
Maybe there's someone we can call.

27:02.246 --> 27:04.391
W-W-Wait. Wait a minute.

27:04.415 --> 27:05.692
He's an organ donor.

27:05.716 --> 27:07.928
I can keep him on the vent,
keep his organs alive.

27:07.952 --> 27:09.796
You stay here.
They need you at the scene.

27:11.250 --> 27:13.061
Larson, get us to Grey-Sloan right now.

27:13.085 --> 27:14.563
They can do the brain death exam there.

27:14.587 --> 27:15.530
Copy that.

27:15.554 --> 27:17.559
You're gonna do good, Steve.

27:17.583 --> 27:20.489
Gonna save a bunch of lives.

27:21.881 --> 27:23.425
I can't feel anything.

27:23.449 --> 27:24.793
W-What's broken?

27:24.817 --> 27:26.228
Everything looks good, Nate.

27:26.252 --> 27:27.556
I can't move anything.

27:27.581 --> 27:28.825
Don't think about that right now.

27:28.849 --> 27:32.428
Lisa's dead, isn't she?

27:32.452 --> 27:33.529
She's... She...

27:33.553 --> 27:35.632
She's okay, Nate.
You're both gonna be fine.

27:38.358 --> 27:39.836
Starting compressions.

27:47.634 --> 27:49.943
- He is dead, man! He's dead!
- Shut up, Tom!

27:50.704 --> 27:52.828
Our friend fell in the water,
and he's not breathing!

27:52.853 --> 27:53.862
He take anything?

27:53.886 --> 27:56.199
He... grabbed his chest and fell.

27:56.223 --> 27:57.600
We got this.

27:57.624 --> 27:58.835
No!

27:58.859 --> 28:00.025
No.

28:01.722 --> 28:04.200
I don't know which is worse... the dying

28:04.224 --> 28:05.735
or having to hear everybody's opinion

28:05.759 --> 28:07.070
about how I should do it.

28:07.094 --> 28:08.905
I'm sorry, sir. Your decision
about your treatment,

28:08.929 --> 28:10.240
i-it's none of my business.

28:10.264 --> 28:12.141
You have no idea what it's like
to hold that baby in there,

28:12.165 --> 28:14.238
knowing that I will never
meet my grandchildren.

28:14.262 --> 28:15.733
I'm not gonna be
at my daughter's wedding.

28:15.757 --> 28:17.445
I'm not gonna see her make Captain.

28:17.469 --> 28:18.599
And I'm not gonna see

28:18.623 --> 28:20.125
that damn fool Dixon fall on his face...

28:20.149 --> 28:22.785
which I know is the least
important of all those things,

28:22.809 --> 28:24.420
but it still pisses me off!

28:24.444 --> 28:26.956
And your big problem is
you have a healthy baby

28:26.980 --> 28:29.047
and your whole life in front of you?

28:32.519 --> 28:33.863
Ohh.

28:37.858 --> 28:39.302
You haven't decided whether or not

28:39.326 --> 28:41.070
you're keeping her, have you?

28:52.627 --> 28:53.660
Gibson.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.543
It's a high spinal injury,

28:59.567 --> 29:02.013
maybe even internal decapitation.

29:02.037 --> 29:04.048
It's been too long. He's gone.

29:04.072 --> 29:06.186
You're beating up a corpse.

29:07.409 --> 29:08.452
Jack.

29:11.713 --> 29:12.745
Jack.

29:14.711 --> 29:15.989
Jack, you have to stop.

29:16.013 --> 29:17.957
- I can still get him back!
- You have to stop!

29:17.981 --> 29:19.192
For what?!

29:20.092 --> 29:22.006
Even if you can get his heart
started again,

29:22.031 --> 29:23.509
his body can't keep it going.

29:23.534 --> 29:25.712
He'll crash over and over and over.

29:25.931 --> 29:29.010
Just being alive
isn't the same as living!

29:30.502 --> 29:32.213
You... You want to make him
keep going like that

29:32.237 --> 29:34.582
so... so you can feel better?

29:34.606 --> 29:37.152
Make him suffer so you can have a win?

29:38.243 --> 29:39.587
It's...

29:39.611 --> 29:41.022
It's...

29:41.046 --> 29:42.991
It's not fair.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.615
And it's selfish and it's cruel and...

29:47.152 --> 29:49.197
You got to stop.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.431
Son, you got to stop.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.033
I'm not stopping until he...

29:53.057 --> 29:54.935
Until he does that!

29:54.959 --> 29:57.171
- All right, rolling him, rolling him.
- Dude!

29:57.195 --> 29:58.105
Now can I treat him?

29:58.129 --> 29:59.406
Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Yeah.

29:59.430 --> 30:00.674
Is he gonna be okay?

30:00.698 --> 30:02.243
As good as he was
before he went in the water.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.416
Okay. On it.

30:14.379 --> 30:15.956
Well.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.159
What do you do for a living, son?

30:18.183 --> 30:21.303
I, uh, turn money into...
into more money.

30:29.698 --> 30:31.409
Well, you ever want
to do something different,

30:31.433 --> 30:32.576
give me a call.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.345
You got a hell of a talent.

30:34.369 --> 30:37.415
You just... stay there
and keep looking stupid.

30:39.674 --> 30:40.985
In a few weeks,

30:41.009 --> 30:43.477
I went from being a single guy,

30:43.785 --> 30:45.863
to a guy expecting a baby,

30:45.887 --> 30:46.965
to a guy that has a baby,

30:46.989 --> 30:49.701
to a guy abandoned with a baby.

30:49.725 --> 30:51.469
I don't know anything
about being a father.

30:51.493 --> 30:54.005
I work 24-hour shifts.
I live on a houseboat.

30:54.029 --> 30:56.541
Isn't it... Isn't it possible

30:56.565 --> 30:58.623
that there is a world

30:58.648 --> 31:00.792
where there are better parents
for her than me?

31:00.816 --> 31:02.894
People who have been
waiting their whole lives

31:02.918 --> 31:04.529
for a child of their own,

31:04.553 --> 31:07.866
who... who can make formula
without spilling it?

31:08.102 --> 31:10.414
Who would give anything for her?

31:10.438 --> 31:12.616
I-I don't know
how to answer that for you.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.251
Can you try?

31:18.546 --> 31:21.158
The night I met you,
you saved a man's life.

31:21.182 --> 31:23.327
You were all-in.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.009
Whether he lived or died.

31:25.033 --> 31:27.612
You weren't on the fence about
what you were there to do.

31:28.203 --> 31:31.049
It's when you're on the fence
that it's all hard.

31:31.073 --> 31:32.116
Everything.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.918
If you're not sure about
keeping this baby,

31:33.942 --> 31:36.995
every time she cries,
it's gonna be painful.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.898
But once you decide you're all-in,

31:38.922 --> 31:41.500
love replaces the fear.

31:41.524 --> 31:45.437
Then, when she cries, well...

31:45.461 --> 31:47.039
she's just crying.

31:53.670 --> 31:56.037
Ready for transport!

31:59.762 --> 32:01.973
Get him on the Aid Car.

32:01.997 --> 32:03.708
- What happened?
- There's been an accident.

32:03.732 --> 32:05.110
Oh, the truck. Is everyone okay?

32:05.134 --> 32:06.435
Did someone call my boss?

32:06.460 --> 32:08.243
Sir, I need you to stay still.
You've been injured.

32:08.267 --> 32:10.039
Can you confirm how many of you
were riding today?

32:10.063 --> 32:11.708
Nine. He's the last one.

32:11.732 --> 32:14.277
There's nine of us.
There's Steve, Nate...

32:14.301 --> 32:15.545
- Hey. Hey. My name's Travis.
- ...Lisa.

32:15.569 --> 32:18.119
- What's your name?
- Charlie. I'm Charlie.

32:18.144 --> 32:20.890
Where's Steve? He's a doctor.
He can probably help.

32:20.914 --> 32:22.191
We're not a real gang, you know?

32:22.215 --> 32:25.161
We're just...
We ride one weekend a month.

32:25.185 --> 32:26.996
And we have barbecues and shoot pool.

32:27.020 --> 32:28.731
There's nine of us.

32:28.755 --> 32:29.966
- We're not a real gang.
- Hey, shh.

32:29.990 --> 32:33.002
We're just... We... Like a family.

32:33.026 --> 32:35.037
Charlie, we're gonna get you
to the hospital now.

32:35.061 --> 32:36.739
A truck hit us.

32:37.187 --> 32:38.364
Oh, my God.

32:38.388 --> 32:40.099
A truck hit us.

32:40.123 --> 32:41.501
We're family.

32:41.525 --> 32:44.070
Is everyone okay?!

32:55.545 --> 32:56.722
No more speeches.

32:58.281 --> 33:01.026
Probie. You earned a drink.

33:01.050 --> 33:03.362
It's... 8:00 a.m.

33:03.386 --> 33:04.696
Yeah?

33:12.073 --> 33:14.318
Is it weird that we're drinking
to get over a bunch of people

33:14.342 --> 33:16.220
getting killed by a drunk driver?

33:16.244 --> 33:17.855
- Are you driving?
- No.

33:17.879 --> 33:19.190
It's not weird.

33:19.214 --> 33:20.224
You know what is weird?

33:20.248 --> 33:22.427
People who think redheads are aliens.

33:22.451 --> 33:23.461
That is weird.

33:23.485 --> 33:24.606
Yeah.

33:24.630 --> 33:25.997
Wow!

33:26.546 --> 33:28.057
It's for Dean and JJ.

33:28.081 --> 33:28.958
Mm.

33:28.982 --> 33:30.492
Fried food's my love language.

33:30.516 --> 33:31.527
See ya.

33:32.685 --> 33:34.897
A year and a half.

33:34.921 --> 33:36.832
Thank you.

33:39.220 --> 33:41.098
- To Probie's first rutabaga call.
- Mm.

33:41.122 --> 33:42.432
Wait. What?

33:42.456 --> 33:44.835
A rutabaga is a patient
with no brain activity.

33:44.859 --> 33:46.103
Zero chance of survival.

33:46.127 --> 33:47.170
Vegetable.

33:47.194 --> 33:48.805
Today was a multi-rutabaga call.

33:48.829 --> 33:50.698
- Stacks of rutabagas.
- Yeah.

33:50.737 --> 33:52.047
Big ol' ratatouille.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.552
How are you guys able
to make jokes about that?

33:56.576 --> 33:59.021
I mean... people died.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.748
People always die.

34:01.772 --> 34:02.916
People die every day.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.810
And a lot of the time,

34:04.834 --> 34:06.701
they do it right in front of us.

34:06.725 --> 34:09.956
Look, a thing they don't
tell you in the academy...

34:09.981 --> 34:12.025
you lose more than you win.

34:12.049 --> 34:13.994
Even on the days
you're doing everything right,

34:14.685 --> 34:16.819
a lot of the time, you still lose.

34:17.922 --> 34:20.801
So you just, uh...
what, you... you drink?

34:20.824 --> 34:21.735
Mm-hmm.

34:21.759 --> 34:23.303
You drink a little,

34:23.327 --> 34:26.246
and you make inappropriate jokes
with your friends.

34:26.272 --> 34:28.050
Then you go home, get some sleep.

34:28.074 --> 34:29.351
Next shift, you go back to work

34:29.375 --> 34:30.786
and do everything right again,

34:30.810 --> 34:32.788
and you have a better day.

34:33.161 --> 34:34.438
Hopefully.

34:34.462 --> 34:37.608
And what if you don't always
do the right thing?

34:37.632 --> 34:40.110
What if you screw it up?

34:46.440 --> 34:48.920
Pretty much the same thing.

34:54.259 --> 34:55.291
Eva.

34:57.162 --> 34:58.606
I heard Rigo's off the vent.

34:58.630 --> 34:59.874
That's great.

35:00.457 --> 35:02.343
Look, if you need help around the house

35:02.367 --> 35:06.314
or, you know, food brought over
or anything, I...

35:06.338 --> 35:07.348
Oh, my God.

35:07.372 --> 35:09.050
Just walk away, Gibson.

35:09.074 --> 35:11.452
No one's here for your apology tour.

35:11.476 --> 35:13.988
Work out your guilt for
putting my husband in the ICU

35:14.012 --> 35:15.023
on your own time.

35:15.047 --> 35:17.525
I have better things to do with mine.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.298
Walk away, little boy.

35:33.257 --> 35:34.056
Hey.

35:35.359 --> 35:36.436
You okay?

35:36.460 --> 35:37.738
Probably not.

35:37.762 --> 35:39.473
You?

35:39.497 --> 35:40.563
No.

35:41.566 --> 35:43.944
You want to blow off some steam?

35:43.968 --> 35:45.746
I... Mm.

35:45.770 --> 35:48.382
It's... just...

35:48.406 --> 35:49.783
It's too messy.

35:52.358 --> 35:54.761
I thought we were trying
to help each other.

35:55.461 --> 35:58.828
You were helping me
stay away from dangerous women.

35:58.853 --> 36:01.065
I was helping you feel something
other than angry.

36:01.089 --> 36:02.666
You are. You did.

36:07.228 --> 36:08.605
I do.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.110
Thank you.

36:19.207 --> 36:20.918
Be good.

36:20.942 --> 36:22.608
Never.

36:28.886 --> 36:30.530
- Thanks, guys.
- See you later. See ya.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.203
So...

36:35.227 --> 36:37.839
Look, man, don't make this a thing.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.407
I have a girlfriend, all right?

36:44.569 --> 36:46.280
Take care of yourself.

36:46.855 --> 36:48.349
Chance.

36:49.189 --> 36:50.358
Thanks, buddy.

36:58.298 --> 37:00.476
Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.712
- Hi! I brought you some beige foo...
- Shh! Stop, stop, stop. Stop.

37:02.736 --> 37:04.681
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

37:04.705 --> 37:06.416
Hey.

37:07.574 --> 37:10.253
How is it going?

37:10.277 --> 37:12.322
Uh, JJ left.

37:12.346 --> 37:13.389
She what?

37:13.413 --> 37:15.992
She left me.

37:16.016 --> 37:18.127
Us.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.682
She's gone, and I was thinking
about giving the baby up,

37:20.706 --> 37:22.884
but then Pruitt came over
and did his Mister Miyagi thing,

37:22.908 --> 37:24.519
and now I'm thinking about keeping her,

37:24.543 --> 37:26.928
which is crazy because I work
three overnight shifts out of the week,

37:26.953 --> 37:30.432
and, the rest of the time,
I am on a boat.

37:30.456 --> 37:31.555
So...

37:36.028 --> 37:39.241
As you may or may not know,
I recently got evicted.

37:39.265 --> 37:40.464
Oh.

37:42.143 --> 37:43.253
I did not know that.

37:43.277 --> 37:44.455
Yeah, it was a thing.

37:44.479 --> 37:45.830
And now I'm...

37:46.914 --> 37:48.092
homeless-ish.

37:48.116 --> 37:50.027
And I was sort of crashing at Jackson's,

37:50.051 --> 37:51.395
but now that's over.

37:51.419 --> 37:53.124
We're over. Jackson and me.

37:53.148 --> 37:54.298
- We...
- Mm.

37:54.322 --> 37:55.532
Pretty sure we're about to be

37:55.556 --> 37:56.867
because he said, "Let's talk later,"

37:56.891 --> 38:00.795
which, in my experience,
is never code for a sexy time.

38:00.820 --> 38:03.154
But, uh, point being, I can help you.

38:04.103 --> 38:06.804
I feel like I missed
a transition somewhere.

38:07.894 --> 38:10.372
I move in here
and help you with the baby,

38:10.786 --> 38:13.265
and then I have a place to live
and you have help,

38:13.289 --> 38:15.000
and everybody's problems are solved.

38:15.024 --> 38:17.469
Oh! Just shut up, please.

38:17.493 --> 38:19.972
No, because you work
the same shifts I do,

38:19.996 --> 38:21.940
so when I'll be gone,
you'll also be gone.

38:21.964 --> 38:23.134
- So not gonna work.
- No, dude, that's what nannies

38:23.159 --> 38:24.042
are for, okay?

38:24.066 --> 38:26.712
And you're super rich so...

38:26.736 --> 38:28.447
Okay, and when we're home at
the same time, we do crying shifts.

38:28.471 --> 38:29.594
- Crying shifts?
- Yeah, crying shifts.

38:29.618 --> 38:30.749
- Crying shifts?
- Crying shifts.

38:30.773 --> 38:33.377
You can keep saying it. I still
won't know what you mean.

38:33.402 --> 38:35.874
Okay, so, like, I take 8:00 to midnight.

38:35.899 --> 38:37.911
You take midnight to 4:00 a.m.

38:37.935 --> 38:39.312
TBD cries, you look at the clock.

38:39.336 --> 38:40.680
If it's your shift, you get up.

38:40.704 --> 38:42.804
If you don't, you go back to sleep.

38:45.943 --> 38:47.353
Pru.

38:47.377 --> 38:48.560
What?

38:49.213 --> 38:50.895
She has a name.

38:51.448 --> 38:52.981
It's Pru.

38:53.784 --> 38:56.029
Pruitt Arike Miller.

38:59.556 --> 39:01.467
And, uh...

39:02.164 --> 39:03.764
me and Pru can use the help, so...

39:05.885 --> 39:07.863
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:07.887 --> 39:08.797
You sure?

39:08.821 --> 39:10.098
- No.
- Yeah!

39:11.824 --> 39:12.868
Okay, okay.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.436
Quiet dancing. Quiet dancing.

39:17.763 --> 39:19.174
Ben?

39:22.160 --> 39:23.571
Please tell me this is not

39:23.595 --> 39:25.906
some fatigue-inducted hallucination,

39:25.930 --> 39:28.909
because I could really use my wife

39:28.933 --> 39:30.444
right about now.

39:30.468 --> 39:33.347
We successfully recovered the organs.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.616
Seven people.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.152
Seven lives saved

39:38.176 --> 39:41.422
because of the work you did
with the PRT today.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.543
Nobody else could've done it.

39:45.567 --> 39:47.578
Seven lives.

39:51.840 --> 39:54.885
And Robert Sullivan's the one
who took the drugs, isn't he?

39:56.769 --> 39:57.880
I-I didn't s...

39:57.904 --> 39:59.214
He was at Grey-Sloan today

39:59.238 --> 40:02.173
for a consult with Amelia Shepherd.

40:03.476 --> 40:06.422
You are a witchy, witchy woman.

40:06.446 --> 40:09.380
Man, how do you just know things?

40:11.670 --> 40:13.136
Man.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.157
Seven lives...

40:17.181 --> 40:20.093
saved because of this vehicle.

40:20.117 --> 40:23.619
This vehicle which will be
recalled and retired.

40:25.252 --> 40:27.531
How many more lives can I save?

40:27.555 --> 40:31.090
Which I won't,
because the PRT is shut down?

40:33.053 --> 40:35.265
He holds lives in his hands, too,

40:35.425 --> 40:37.770
and he decides who runs into fires.

40:37.794 --> 40:39.505
He... I know, I know, but...

40:39.529 --> 40:41.173
I know.

40:53.679 --> 40:56.959
Well, I am very glad you called.

40:56.983 --> 40:59.661
But I should go back to work now.

40:59.685 --> 41:01.418
I'm the truck.

41:03.707 --> 41:07.153
I'm... sorry. I'm not very good
at American idioms.

41:07.177 --> 41:09.556
I'm the truck. I'm... I'm... I'm...

41:12.373 --> 41:15.852
I'm the truck that drunkenly
plowed into Station 19

41:15.876 --> 41:18.668
and destroyed an entire family.

41:19.380 --> 41:20.790
Hey.

41:20.814 --> 41:22.092
Hey.

41:22.116 --> 41:24.149
I'm the truck.

41:39.712 --> 41:41.367
I don't want to fight anymore.

41:41.391 --> 41:44.470
I don't want to fight my dad.
I don't want to fight you.

41:44.494 --> 41:46.071
I am so tired

41:46.095 --> 41:49.408
and... and sad and sick of being angry.

41:49.432 --> 41:55.280
And I-I just want to feel
and to be in a safe place.

41:55.304 --> 41:58.150
And I don't know why or how,
and I-I can't explain it,

41:58.174 --> 41:59.785
but you're the safest place I have.

41:59.809 --> 42:01.587
And everything would be okay

42:01.611 --> 42:03.255
for the first time in a really long time

42:03.279 --> 42:05.891
if you would just start kissing me now.

42:05.915 --> 42:06.925
So...
