00:02.135 --> 00:03.693
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.870 --> 00:06.634
For over a century,
I have lived in secret until now.

00:06.806 --> 00:08.967
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

00:09.142 --> 00:12.737
As a founding family member, it's my
duty to report some distressing news.

00:12.912 --> 00:15.005
- He's a Gilbert?
- Elena's uncle.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.649
Mayor Lockwood, is it?
My name is Pearl.

00:17.817 --> 00:20.217
- Hi.
- This is my daughter, Anna.

00:20.387 --> 00:24.221
Maybe there is such a thing as vampires.
They're just different.

00:25.592 --> 00:27.822
You got a problem with blood, Anna?

00:28.328 --> 00:32.526
The coroner's office has officially ruled
Vicki Donovan's death a drug overdose.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.167
- You don't think it was an overdose.
- Let it go.

00:35.335 --> 00:37.530
Is there something
you're not telling me?

00:39.339 --> 00:40.863
Take my wrist. You need blood.

00:41.441 --> 00:44.376
I have this hunger inside of me
that I've never...

00:44.544 --> 00:47.035
I've never felt before in my entire life.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.113
I don't want you to see me like this.

00:49.315 --> 00:51.909
I don't want you to know
that this side of me exists.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:10.236 --> 01:11.464
Nice car.

01:12.939 --> 01:16.238
Well, it was a waste to leave it sitting
in the garage.

01:17.844 --> 01:20.074
I didn't know you were coming back
today.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.782
You know, I woke up this morning
and I was feeling great...

01:24.951 --> 01:28.443
...and I figured it was time for me
to get back into things.

01:28.621 --> 01:30.816
Does that mean you're okay now?

01:30.990 --> 01:35.051
- With all the cravings?
- Yeah, I mean the worst part is over.

01:35.228 --> 01:40.791
So now all I wanna do is just spend
as much time with you as possible.

01:40.967 --> 01:43.435
I'm okay with that.

01:45.405 --> 01:46.463
Hey, thank you.

01:47.006 --> 01:51.136
For helping me get through
the rough patch.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.468
You're welcome.

01:55.014 --> 01:57.642
- We're gonna be late.
- Okay. You know what?

01:57.817 --> 01:59.785
I'll catch up. I'm gonna grab my stuff.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.387
- I'll be right behind you.
- Okay.

02:26.279 --> 02:30.181
There was a disturbance at the hospital.
Some of the supply was compromised.

02:30.850 --> 02:33.182
Compromised. You mean, stolen?

02:33.953 --> 02:36.820
We almost missed it.
The inventory records were altered.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.551
When the manager was questioned,
he had no recollection of changing them.

02:40.727 --> 02:42.695
Meaning the vampire
used mind control...

02:42.862 --> 02:45.228
...to hide the theft.
- I know what you meant.

02:45.431 --> 02:49.390
John alerted us to recent discrepancies
at other hospital blood banks...

02:49.569 --> 02:52.970
...in the county.
- How lucky for us we have John.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.801
We're stepping up security,
giving the guards vervain...

02:55.975 --> 02:57.840
...to prevent this
from happening again.

02:58.011 --> 03:02.175
Might I offer a suggestion? Why don't
Damon and I put our heads together?

03:02.348 --> 03:04.748
We could track down
whoever's doing this.

03:04.951 --> 03:08.853
Truthfully, I could use extra hands.
Is that something you'd be willing to do?

03:09.355 --> 03:13.257
- Well, of course. I mean, if it will help.
I think we'll make a good team.

03:13.459 --> 03:14.824
Don't you, Damon?

03:14.994 --> 03:17.087
Whatever I can do
to keep this town safe.

03:17.263 --> 03:20.027
Even if it means spending time
with you.

03:25.405 --> 03:27.168
Okay.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.900
This week,
we're gonna set aside our curriculum...

03:30.076 --> 03:33.102
...for a lesson in local history
as we approach Founder's Day.

03:33.846 --> 03:37.179
The community leaders feel that's
more important than World War II.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.908
But, hey, what do I know?

03:39.085 --> 03:40.177
Sorry I'm late.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.014
Looks like we will be
at full occupancy.

03:42.188 --> 03:43.917
Welcome home, Bonnie.

03:45.024 --> 03:46.389
Right, Founder's Day.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.225
What does it mean
to have a Founder's Day?

03:49.395 --> 03:53.729
Well, if you turn your attention
to this exquisite diorama over here...

03:53.900 --> 03:54.958
...that I spent all night
painstakingly...

03:58.805 --> 04:02.036
I suppose I should be grateful.
You learned to use the bell.

04:02.208 --> 04:06.372
- I am here on behalf of my mother.
- On behalf of or in spite of?

04:06.546 --> 04:09.242
I'm sorry about what
the other vampires did to Stefan.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.407
Abducting, torturing him.
It wasn't supposed to go like that.

04:12.585 --> 04:16.612
You were playing house with half
of a tomb of really pissed-off vampires.

04:16.789 --> 04:19.656
- What did you think was gonna happen?
- My mom is devastated.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.156
They tried to overthrow her.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.790
- Why isn't she here?
- She doesn't really do apologies.

04:24.964 --> 04:28.058
Well, that's a coincidence.
I don't do forgiveness, so run along.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.964
If you're gonna continue playing
house with your pets...

04:31.137 --> 04:34.163
...you might wanna stop
robbing the blood bank dry...

04:34.340 --> 04:35.932
...because they're on to it.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.669
I haven't been to the local blood bank
in a week.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.745
- It's the others.
- The others are gone.

04:40.913 --> 04:44.781
- Well, where did they go?
- They weren't cut out for this town.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.977
After what happened, my mom
kicked them out and they took off.

04:48.154 --> 04:49.781
It's just us and Harper now.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.617
Bonnie.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.092
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:57.263 --> 05:01.165
L... I tried to grab you after class,
but you had already taken off.

05:01.334 --> 05:05.998
- How are you? How's your family?
- We're dealing. It's been hard.

05:07.106 --> 05:08.334
Everyone here missed you.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.272
Yeah, I had so much to deal with
after Grams' funeral.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.969
And after you told me
the tomb spell failed...

05:14.147 --> 05:16.172
...I just didn't really
wanna come back.

05:16.349 --> 05:18.374
I hope that you understand
why I called.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.677
I wanted you to know
before you came home.

05:20.853 --> 05:24.220
I understand why.
I just shouldn't know.

05:26.225 --> 05:28.090
- I know it's been really hard.
Bonnie.

05:28.394 --> 05:31.056
Bonnie, thank God you're home.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.221
I know we talked every day.
I missed you.

05:33.399 --> 05:36.459
- How are you doing?
- Better. It's better, you know?

05:36.636 --> 05:39.628
Glad to be back.
And I'm trying to keep myself busy.

05:39.806 --> 05:43.970
Well, I can help with that.
Major wardrobe confab needed, ASAP.

05:44.143 --> 05:47.909
You need to help me pick the perfect
dress for the Founder's Court.

05:48.114 --> 05:50.207
The Founder's Court?
Did I miss something?

05:51.884 --> 05:55.820
The Founder's Court.
You know, Miss Mystic Falls.

05:55.988 --> 05:59.219
They announced it today.
And you and I are both on it.

05:59.392 --> 06:02.725
Oh, my God, we signed up for that
so long ago. I completely forgot.

06:04.163 --> 06:05.824
So are you dropping out, then?

06:09.068 --> 06:11.059
I can't.

06:11.571 --> 06:12.595
No?

06:12.772 --> 06:15.536
Her mom is the one
who wanted her to enter.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.581
How was school?

06:26.152 --> 06:27.244
Fine.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.888
Yeah? Same old, same old?

06:30.056 --> 06:34.083
Nothing new?
No stories to bring home?

06:35.027 --> 06:37.120
You're making small talk, why?

06:37.296 --> 06:39.628
You seem chipper lately.
Less doom and gloom.

06:39.799 --> 06:41.232
Little more pep in your step.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.961
And you think it's because
I drank human blood again.

06:44.170 --> 06:48.106
I mean, I don't wanna brag, but I would
definitely take responsibility...

06:48.274 --> 06:50.606
...for this new and improved you.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.439
Right. Well, I hate to burst your bubble,
but I'm clean.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.581
Yeah, not possible.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.709
Not only is it possible,
but it is quite true.

06:59.318 --> 07:01.786
Stefan, let's be serious for a second.

07:02.488 --> 07:07.289
You've spent the last century and a half
being a poster child for Prozac.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.894
And now you expect me to believe
this new you...

07:10.062 --> 07:13.122
...has nothing to do with human blood.
Nothing.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.429
I'm clean.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.764
You're lying.

07:20.072 --> 07:21.733
Believe what you want.

07:27.313 --> 07:28.940
I'm sorry for the short notice.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.414
I didn't know the contest was
coming up, or that I would be in it.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.246
I'll be happy to escort you.

07:34.420 --> 07:37.014
My mom was really into
this Founder's Day stuff.

07:37.223 --> 07:39.088
She was even Miss Mystic in her day.

07:39.992 --> 07:41.584
I kind of wanted do it for her.

07:41.761 --> 07:44.457
Well, it'll be great. We'll have fun.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.495
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

07:46.666 --> 07:48.964
- I love you.
- I love you too.

08:15.561 --> 08:17.222
Well, well.

08:17.396 --> 08:19.364
He's a liar and a thief.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.811
So when were you gonna share?

08:35.481 --> 08:37.005
Go ahead. Help yourself.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.846
No, I'm talking about the fact
that you're a closet blood junkie.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.419
So I'm drinking blood again.

08:42.587 --> 08:45.819
You're the one that shoved it on me.
What's your problem?

08:46.559 --> 08:48.527
- I have it under control.
- Under control?

08:49.161 --> 08:50.822
You robbed a hospital.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.490
So, what's your point?

08:52.665 --> 08:55.225
Fine. Whatever, man. Drink up.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.234
Just remember,
we're trying to keep a low profile.

08:58.404 --> 09:01.396
Why don't you walk up
to Sheriff Forbes, ask her to tap a vein?

09:01.574 --> 09:05.101
Have my actions
negatively impacted you?

09:05.311 --> 09:07.279
I can't imagine
what that must feel like.

09:07.446 --> 09:10.108
Yeah. What does Elena think
about the new you?

09:10.950 --> 09:13.384
Nothing's changed.
I'm still the same person.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.420
- Clearly.
- Elena doesn't need to know anything.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.884
You've been off the human stuff
for years, Stefan.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.187
- Lf you're having trouble...
- I'm not.

09:23.362 --> 09:26.297
Who do you think you're talking to?
I know what it's like.

09:26.465 --> 09:29.901
Jekyll and Hyde feeling. That switch.
Sometimes it goes off, you snap.

09:30.069 --> 09:33.436
Right now is not a good time for me
to be worried about you snapping.

09:33.606 --> 09:38.407
- I know that it pains you to see this.
- Mm.

09:38.578 --> 09:42.275
But I'm fine. Okay? I'm fine.

09:42.448 --> 09:45.474
So please do me a favor...

09:47.620 --> 09:49.588
...and back off.

09:54.560 --> 09:58.223
This year's queen will have the
special honor of taking center stage...

09:58.397 --> 10:00.228
...at the 150th Founder's Day Gala.

10:00.733 --> 10:04.396
Before we crown our winner, we'd like
to get to know a bit more about you.

10:04.570 --> 10:08.472
I'm on the MF beautification committee,
volunteer at the center's soup kitchen.

10:08.641 --> 10:12.304
I recognize that I haven't been
as involved this year as I used to be.

10:12.478 --> 10:14.776
I implemented this year's
Go Green Campaign.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.643
I've been distracted
and I let a lot of things slide.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.978
I don't think it's wrong
to win twice in a row.

10:20.152 --> 10:23.986
I was surprised to have been selected.
I'm not from the founding families.

10:24.156 --> 10:27.785
I'm aware of what an honor this is.
I want you to know I take it seriously.

10:27.960 --> 10:31.157
Worked with the recycling program,
in charge of the Yearly Raffle.

10:31.330 --> 10:36.131
My DUl made my service mandatory.
Doesn't mean I was any less committed.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.463
This was really important
to my mother.

10:38.638 --> 10:43.905
She believes in community,
family, honor and loyalty.

10:44.510 --> 10:47.673
It's a legacy she left for me.

10:50.282 --> 10:51.977
- Hey, partner.
- What do you want?

10:52.151 --> 10:54.881
You haven't returned any of my calls.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.022
Most people would take that as a hint.

10:57.189 --> 10:59.384
Where do we start looking
for vampires?

10:59.558 --> 11:03.016
Why the act, John? You obviously
don't care about catching vampires.

11:03.195 --> 11:05.959
- You're here talking to me.
- Actually, I care very much.

11:06.132 --> 11:10.364
What did Isobel say about that?
I mean, considering that she is one.

11:10.536 --> 11:13.699
- Isobel and I share a mutual interest.
- Mm.

11:13.873 --> 11:17.570
The original Johnathan Gilbert had an
invention that was stolen by a vampire.

11:17.743 --> 11:21.702
That vampire was then burned alive
in Fell's Church, or so Johnathan thought.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.076
- And the invention was lost forever.
- Mm.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.083
But then the vampires weren't killed,
were they?

11:28.054 --> 11:29.681
They were trapped.

11:29.855 --> 11:33.757
And now they're free, thanks to you,
which means the invention is retrievable.

11:33.959 --> 11:37.019
- Well, what is it?
- The thing that matters is I want it back.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.165
And you're going to help me
if you want your secret safe.

11:40.332 --> 11:42.391
I mean, why bring me into it, John?

11:42.568 --> 11:45.036
I don't know what you're talking about,
who has it.

11:45.204 --> 11:48.230
Oh, come on, Damon.
You were around back then.

11:48.407 --> 11:51.467
You know who these people are,
what they look like.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.878
He was friendly with a woman
who turned out to be a vampire.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.174
Her name was Pearl.

11:57.349 --> 11:58.407
Does that ring a bell?

12:03.122 --> 12:05.352
I'm not playing anymore.

12:06.425 --> 12:09.019
Get out. Get out.

12:09.528 --> 12:13.555
- I beg your pardon.
- I only entertained this whole scheme...

12:13.733 --> 12:16.224
...because I thought you could lead me
to Katherine.

12:16.402 --> 12:20.133
But see, now I know you have no idea
where Katherine is, because if you did...

12:20.306 --> 12:24.743
...you would know that Katherine
and Pearl were best friends.

12:25.945 --> 12:28.880
See, you don't know everything,
do you, John?

12:31.951 --> 12:33.942
I'll tell the entire Council
what you are.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.556
Go for it. I'll kill every last one,
and then I'll sever your hand...

12:37.723 --> 12:40.556
...pull your ring off and I'll kill you too.

12:41.026 --> 12:43.551
Do you understand that?

12:45.231 --> 12:47.256
Honor your partner.

12:51.237 --> 12:54.604
Let's focus. Right hand around.

12:56.909 --> 12:59.309
Flirt with your eyes.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.307
Left hand around.

13:10.856 --> 13:13.086
- This is ridiculous.
Both hands.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.454
You're saying that
because you don't know how.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.529
Sorry only one of us was around
when the dance was invented.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.665
- Ouch.
- Whoa! Ha-ha-ha!

13:20.833 --> 13:24.291
No, no, no.
There's no touching during this part.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.496
It's about the simple intimacy
of the near-touch.

13:27.673 --> 13:31.131
- Very nice, Amber.
- Thank you, Mrs. Lockwood.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.837
If you ask me,
the near-touch is overrated.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.940
- You seem to be in a good mood.
- Is that a bad thing?

13:39.118 --> 13:41.109
Would you prefer me brooding
and tortured?

13:41.287 --> 13:44.347
- Hey, I'm not complaining.
- Oh, no touching.

13:47.026 --> 13:49.290
The Fell cousins don't have a shot.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.326
Amber Bradley is only on the court...

13:51.497 --> 13:55.297
...so the pageant doesn't look like
it's founding families only, which it is.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.832
So that leaves Elena.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.903
And she totally has the sympathy vote
since her parents died.

14:00.105 --> 14:03.006
- How can I compete with that?
- Very nice.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.733
- Very sensitive.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

14:04.910 --> 14:08.346
This must sound really unimportant
in light of everything.

14:08.514 --> 14:12.075
It's okay. I get it. You wanna win.

14:12.251 --> 14:15.379
My grandmother was Miss Mystic
and both of my aunts.

14:15.554 --> 14:19.149
My mom is the only one
who didn't get the gene, and I want this.

14:19.325 --> 14:21.020
And I actually deserve this.

14:29.668 --> 14:31.260
Bonnie. Hey.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.769
Hey, how are you?

14:38.444 --> 14:42.175
I begged Bonnie to fill in for Matt.
He had to work today.

14:45.084 --> 14:46.551
Bonnie, do you have a minute?

14:47.953 --> 14:50.421
We only have 30 minutes
for rehearsal.

14:50.589 --> 14:52.250
It'll only take a minute.

14:52.424 --> 14:54.392
Please.

15:07.806 --> 15:11.173
- You have to tell me what's wrong.
- It's not worth talking about.

15:11.810 --> 15:13.437
What do you mean, not worth it?

15:14.280 --> 15:18.114
You've barely said 10 words to me
and you won't even look at Stefan.

15:20.286 --> 15:21.913
Is that what it is? Is it Stefan?

15:25.958 --> 15:27.323
Listen.

15:27.493 --> 15:31.054
Elena, I can't just pretend
like everything is okay.

15:31.563 --> 15:36.398
Everything my grams did was to protect
us from those vampires in the tomb.

15:36.568 --> 15:40.265
And now they're out,
which means she died for nothing.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.503
I'm so sorry, Bonnie.

15:47.513 --> 15:50.107
- What can I do to make it better?
- That's just it.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.947
There's nothing you can do.

15:53.152 --> 15:56.679
I blame him, Elena. Him and Damon.

15:56.855 --> 16:01.815
And I'm not gonna put you in a situation
where you have to choose sides.

16:02.728 --> 16:04.992
I'm just having a hard time with it.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.931
Okay?

16:10.869 --> 16:11.927
Pass it.

16:12.104 --> 16:14.004
Stay on your man!

16:15.874 --> 16:17.501
Good defense.

16:17.676 --> 16:19.109
Oh, yeah.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.673
Oh, dude, are you okay?
You're bleeding.

16:25.851 --> 16:28.376
Yeah, I'm all right.
It's just a little blood.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.353
It's cool.

16:35.894 --> 16:37.259
Aah! Stefan.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.860
- Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.327
I was just...

16:45.571 --> 16:48.802
I was feeling a little sick. I'm fine.

17:04.556 --> 17:07.150
- Hey, I heard you're driving.
- Hi. Yeah, I am.

17:07.326 --> 17:09.260
Let me get that for you.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.657
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.593
How, uh?

17:13.799 --> 17:14.992
How is Stefan?

17:16.201 --> 17:19.432
- What do you mean?
- You know, he seems on edge.

17:20.105 --> 17:21.196
He went through a lot.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.365
He was in bad shape for a while,
but he's bouncing back now.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.403
Alaric? Hey, buddy.

17:28.580 --> 17:32.380
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I'm the chauffeur.

17:32.918 --> 17:35.182
I thought I was driving.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.552
No need. We're going with Ric.

17:39.858 --> 17:42.554
Are we ready?
- Mm-hm. Jeremy can ride with you.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.077
In the running for Miss Mystic Falls?

18:06.585 --> 18:09.713
Sometimes you have to wear
uncomfortable heels to blend in.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.983
I remember this event from 1864.

18:15.160 --> 18:19.153
I was supposed to enter
before everything happened.

18:19.364 --> 18:22.891
Ahh. Nostalgia's a bitch.

18:23.168 --> 18:26.228
If you're just gonna mock me,
can you move along, please?

18:26.405 --> 18:29.397
John Gilbert thinks your mom stole
an artifact...

18:29.575 --> 18:34.069
...from Johnathan senior senior
back in 1864.

18:34.246 --> 18:35.645
What are you, his errand boy?

18:35.814 --> 18:38.476
I don't know what it is.
I don't want him to have it.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.277
I could ask her.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.821
You've made it pretty clear that you
don't trust us. So why should I bother?

18:44.990 --> 18:49.518
Because you wanna stay in Mystic Falls.
John Gilbert's making that impossible.

18:49.695 --> 18:54.257
Find out where it is. He leaves,
you can buy a welcome mat.

18:58.203 --> 19:00.330
Thanks for helping me.

19:00.506 --> 19:04.169
Don't thank me until you're sure
your hair isn't gonna burn off.

19:05.611 --> 19:09.274
You know, I remember when my mom
and I were first applying for this.

19:09.448 --> 19:13.214
- She was so excited.
- So were you, if I recall.

19:13.719 --> 19:17.712
I was. She just made it sound
like so much fun.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.356
A lot's changed since then.

19:20.225 --> 19:23.126
I hate to break it to you,
but it's late for cold feet.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.961
I don't have cold feet. I just...

19:26.331 --> 19:29.357
I think I'd be enjoying it a lot more
if she was here.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.300
I'll tell you one thing. Your hair
would have a better chance if she was.

19:39.878 --> 19:41.539
Okay. I should go put my dress on.

19:43.315 --> 19:46.648
Be careful with that thing.
Don't hurt anybody.

19:51.156 --> 19:52.646
You look miserable.

19:54.159 --> 19:57.856
Are there really a whole month of these
events that I'm supposed to show up at?

19:58.030 --> 20:01.193
You can fight it if you want,
but it's part of being a Gilbert.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.495
Yeah. You mentioned
you know a lot about the family.

20:05.003 --> 20:07.767
You know anything about our ancestor,
Johnathan Gilbert?

20:08.540 --> 20:11.907
Prolific writer, crazy inventor.
Why do you ask?

20:12.077 --> 20:13.977
Well, I read his journal.

20:14.846 --> 20:16.040
Is that right?

20:16.215 --> 20:19.673
Yeah. I actually found it
in all Dad's stuff.

20:20.252 --> 20:23.585
Well, that's surprising.
Most of them are locked away.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.290
- There's more of them?
- Johnathan Gilbert journaled his life.

20:27.492 --> 20:29.687
Right down to
the bitter, insane, drunken end.

20:30.195 --> 20:32.857
- The guy had a lot of demons.
- And did you read them?

20:33.031 --> 20:34.293
I've browsed. Yeah.

20:34.499 --> 20:36.524
What did you think
about what he wrote?

20:37.869 --> 20:40.565
Crazy ramblings of a madman,
of course.

20:48.447 --> 20:49.744
She's very pretty.

20:51.083 --> 20:55.645
Yeah. Yeah, she's a friend of mine.
Excuse me.

21:06.131 --> 21:07.223
Are you okay, Amber?

21:07.899 --> 21:09.992
I hate being the center of attention.

21:10.168 --> 21:11.635
I get panic attacks.

21:11.803 --> 21:13.930
Do you need some privacy
so you can change?

21:14.106 --> 21:17.337
Actually, I'm just gonna go
get some air.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.181
Hey.

21:26.351 --> 21:28.478
- You can't be back here.
- We need to talk.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.549
Does it have to be right now?

21:32.424 --> 21:36.485
Normally I would have a different outlook
on what I'm about to tell you...

21:36.662 --> 21:40.758
...but since it could really
inconvenience me, I'll squeal.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.097
What are you talking about?

21:43.268 --> 21:45.759
Stefan's still drinking human blood.

21:47.873 --> 21:49.704
- What?
- Yeah.

21:50.809 --> 21:54.506
A month ago, I would've rejoiced,
but with the Council back on the alert...

21:54.680 --> 21:57.478
...it is not a good time
for Stefan to fly off the handle.

21:57.649 --> 22:00.516
I know he's been a little edgy,
but he said that was normal.

22:00.686 --> 22:05.350
He has a fridge full of stolen
blood-bank contraband in the house.

22:07.592 --> 22:08.650
Oh, my God.

22:08.827 --> 22:12.888
He has no idea what normal is.
His entire existence isn't normal.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.832
Normal to a vampire
is drinking human blood.

22:16.001 --> 22:19.869
He spent this time fighting it, when he
should've been learning to control it.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.869
And now it's controlling him instead.

22:22.374 --> 22:25.810
I can't believe this. I mean,
it's Stefan we're talking about here.

22:25.977 --> 22:29.879
Stefan on human blood, Elena.
He'll do anything, he'll say anything...

22:30.048 --> 22:32.243
...because he's not gonna
wanna stop.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.745
Trust me.

22:37.055 --> 22:38.545
Anna.

22:39.424 --> 22:41.119
What is it?

22:42.160 --> 22:45.357
- Oh, come on. Don't be like that.
- Why not?

22:46.565 --> 22:49.261
You were basically using me to turn you
into a vampire...

22:49.434 --> 22:52.267
...so you could be with someone else.
- I wasn't using you.

22:52.437 --> 22:55.600
Really?
Then how would you like to define it?

22:55.774 --> 22:58.242
I don't think it's worse
than becoming friends...

22:58.410 --> 23:01.038
...so you could give your mother
my blood.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.711
How do you know that?

23:03.949 --> 23:05.780
It's not important.

23:05.951 --> 23:07.145
Seriously, Jeremy.

23:07.652 --> 23:10.052
- What do you know?
- Everything.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.712
I know everything.

23:15.160 --> 23:19.358
This is all my fault. I'm the one
who fed him the blood in the first place.

23:21.032 --> 23:22.590
Uh...

23:23.201 --> 23:24.759
What's going on in here?

23:25.537 --> 23:31.407
I'm just filling Elena in
on your extracurricular activities.

23:34.679 --> 23:38.046
- What are you talking about?
- I know about the blood, Stefan.

23:38.950 --> 23:42.579
I'm gonna... I'll be downstairs drinking.

23:54.933 --> 23:55.991
I was gonna tell you.

23:56.201 --> 23:57.566
When?

23:58.837 --> 24:00.600
I'm fine.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.935
I'm fine.
The blood, it doesn't change anything.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.241
It's changing you.

24:06.411 --> 24:08.845
Why? Because I kept it a secret
from you?

24:09.014 --> 24:10.140
Come on, Elena, look.

24:10.315 --> 24:14.615
Given the way that you're reacting now,
can you really blame me for doing that?

24:14.786 --> 24:16.845
Are you hearing yourself right now?

24:17.022 --> 24:19.252
You've been stealing blood and lying.

24:19.424 --> 24:22.757
And you say that everything's fine?
Everything is not fine, Stefan.

24:22.928 --> 24:25.294
So you and Damon
have everything figured out.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.433
It's not about Damon.
It's about what's happening to you.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.864
I know
and I'm telling you that I'm fine.

24:31.036 --> 24:32.697
I'm fine.

24:32.871 --> 24:36.466
Please, come on.
Elena, I thought you...

24:36.641 --> 24:37.972
I thought you believed in me.

24:39.444 --> 24:41.139
Elena, let's go. The lineup's starting.

24:43.348 --> 24:46.374
- I just... I need a minute.
- You're not even dressed yet.

24:47.018 --> 24:49.885
Escorts wait downstairs, Stefan.

25:10.542 --> 25:12.339
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

25:20.051 --> 25:21.882
Miss Tina Fell...

25:22.053 --> 25:24.351
...escorted by Bartholomew Whitmore.

25:32.163 --> 25:34.495
Has anyone seen Amber?

25:36.167 --> 25:38.294
Do you see Stefan down there?

25:40.305 --> 25:43.172
Nope. Just my boring fill-in escort.

25:43.341 --> 25:46.174
- What happened to Matt?
- They wouldn't let him out of work.

25:46.344 --> 25:48.209
- What happened to Stefan?
- I don't know.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.848
He just disappeared somewhere.
I don't know.

25:51.016 --> 25:52.347
What am I doing?

25:52.517 --> 25:54.576
I never should've gone through
with this.

25:54.753 --> 25:56.880
- What do you mean?
- I need to find Stefan.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.455
This isn't me.
I'm not this person anymore.

25:59.624 --> 26:00.750
No, no, no. No way. No.

26:01.459 --> 26:03.120
You had your chance to drop out.

26:03.328 --> 26:05.296
And believe me, I was all for it.

26:05.463 --> 26:07.590
Because there is no way
that I can beat you.

26:08.433 --> 26:12.267
Elena, you're doing this
because it was important to your mom.

26:14.406 --> 26:19.708
Miss Caroline Forbes
and her escort, Jeffrey Lockwood Hamilton.

26:31.156 --> 26:32.885
Elena, you're next.

26:36.995 --> 26:39.555
- You're missing Elena's introduction.
I don't care.

26:40.865 --> 26:42.730
So she has no idea
you read her journal?

26:42.901 --> 26:46.302
She keeps things from me,
I'm gonna keep things from her.

26:46.471 --> 26:48.063
What are you gonna do now?

26:48.239 --> 26:51.333
Now that you know everything
that she's been hiding from you.

26:51.509 --> 26:52.737
I don't know.

26:53.745 --> 26:56.145
There's a part of me that's so angry.

26:56.314 --> 26:58.612
I mean, she covered up
what happened to Vicki...

26:58.783 --> 27:00.944
...and erased my memory...

27:01.119 --> 27:03.986
...but there's also this other part of me
that's glad.

27:04.155 --> 27:05.747
I...

27:05.924 --> 27:07.949
I don't wanna remember Vicki
like that.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.018
As a monster?

27:11.129 --> 27:13.825
No, as someone who wanted
to hurt me.

27:16.501 --> 27:18.298
When I met you...

27:18.837 --> 27:22.204
...you were just a part of my plan
to get my mother back.

27:22.407 --> 27:24.341
But then things changed.

27:24.509 --> 27:26.204
All the time we spent together.

27:27.212 --> 27:29.646
I would never do anything to hurt you.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.339
Not now. You know that, right?

27:34.285 --> 27:36.116
Yeah, I know that.

27:46.831 --> 27:49.163
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

27:50.468 --> 27:51.833
I'm in the ceremony.

27:52.370 --> 27:53.837
Not now you're not.

27:54.005 --> 27:57.031
You're standing in the parking lot
with me.

27:57.208 --> 27:59.472
I'm in the parking lot with you.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.546
I'm sorry.

28:02.714 --> 28:03.874
I'm sorry.

28:04.949 --> 28:08.385
I'm not very good to be around
right now. I'm a little bit on edge.

28:08.553 --> 28:12.080
I've been drinking the human stuff,
and it's really screwing with my head.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.722
She knows now.

28:15.493 --> 28:19.691
She wasn't supposed to find out. I didn't
want her to. Now everything's ruined.

28:20.265 --> 28:21.857
You seem sad.

28:24.335 --> 28:26.428
I'm not sad.

28:26.604 --> 28:28.902
I'm freaking hungry.

28:29.074 --> 28:30.598
Miss Elena Gilbert...

28:30.775 --> 28:33.403
...escorted by Mr. Stefan Salvatore.

28:58.036 --> 28:59.367
Where's Stefan?

28:59.537 --> 29:00.868
I don't know.

29:14.018 --> 29:17.249
- What is she doing with Damon?
- I have no idea.

29:21.559 --> 29:25.154
- What are we gonna do?
- Right now we have to get through this.

30:43.208 --> 30:48.168
I don't hurt people. I don't do that.
I'm the good brother.

30:48.713 --> 30:50.738
Do you wanna hurt me?

30:58.523 --> 31:00.514
I want to kill you.

31:03.995 --> 31:07.055
I wanna rip into your skin.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.890
And I wanna feed on your blood.

31:10.068 --> 31:12.161
Under your skin.

31:12.337 --> 31:14.168
Pulsating, flowing.

31:15.406 --> 31:18.204
Your carotid artery right there.

31:19.644 --> 31:22.238
If you puncture this right,
you can control the flow.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.040
It takes practice...

31:24.682 --> 31:28.174
...but it doesn't have to make a mess.
You don't have to waste any.

31:28.353 --> 31:29.513
What's stopping you?

31:33.057 --> 31:34.718
If I do this...

31:34.893 --> 31:37.726
...if I give in, there's no going back.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.459
Then don't.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.066
I just want one taste.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.431
That's all I need.
I just want one taste.

31:47.939 --> 31:49.236
One taste.

32:07.325 --> 32:08.383
Where's Amber?

32:08.559 --> 32:09.583
I don't know.

32:09.761 --> 32:13.390
Before I crown the winner,
I'd like to offer a personal thank you...

32:13.564 --> 32:17.694
...to all of these young ladies
for their efforts to better our community.

32:20.972 --> 32:24.464
So without further ado,
it is my honor...

32:24.642 --> 32:29.272
...to announce our very own
Miss Mystic Falls, Miss Caroline Forbes.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.245
Congratulations.

32:33.418 --> 32:34.908
I actually won.

32:48.833 --> 32:51.233
There's blood on the glass.

32:57.842 --> 32:59.104
Get me Damon Salvatore.

32:59.277 --> 33:01.370
I can't do this.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.475
- What's the matter?
- I can't do this.

33:05.650 --> 33:06.844
It's okay.

33:07.018 --> 33:10.977
It doesn't hurt that much.
Just not so hard next time.

33:11.155 --> 33:13.487
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
I can't stop.

33:14.325 --> 33:16.020
I can't stop.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.354
Why aren't you afraid of me, huh?

33:21.532 --> 33:22.863
You told me not to be.

33:28.806 --> 33:30.034
What's your name?

33:31.009 --> 33:32.567
Amber.

33:33.478 --> 33:34.570
Listen to me, Amber.

33:34.779 --> 33:37.748
I need you to be afraid of me.

33:37.915 --> 33:40.577
I need you to run like hell.
Do you understand me?

33:40.785 --> 33:42.309
Run. Run. Now.

33:51.662 --> 33:52.720
Did you find him?

33:52.897 --> 33:55.229
There were signs of a struggle
in the bathroom.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.765
There was blood.

33:56.934 --> 33:59.494
- And that Amber girl is missing.
- Oh, my God.

33:59.670 --> 34:01.934
No, he wouldn't hurt her. He won't.

34:02.106 --> 34:06.167
Let's just find him, okay?
Let's get your coat. Come on.

34:14.351 --> 34:18.083
- You said to run.
- I changed my mind.

34:21.359 --> 34:22.587
Stefan!

34:23.628 --> 34:25.094
Stefan.

34:25.263 --> 34:27.025
Come on. Get control. Come on.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.366
It's okay. Come on.

34:30.333 --> 34:31.733
Breathe through it, man.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.132
Stefan, stop it.

35:04.869 --> 35:06.461
It's okay.

35:07.305 --> 35:08.932
Stefan.

35:23.321 --> 35:25.016
She doesn't remember
what happened.

35:25.189 --> 35:28.488
It's a good thing the girls got here.
She lost a lot of blood.

35:28.659 --> 35:30.422
You didn't see anything?

35:35.032 --> 35:39.935
No, we just found her
and then called Damon.

35:41.772 --> 35:44.468
- Is she gonna be okay?
- It looks like it, yeah.

35:45.276 --> 35:48.473
You girls get back to the party.
Damon and I can take it from here.

35:48.646 --> 35:51.479
- Yeah.
- Okay.

35:58.823 --> 36:02.281
- They didn't see the bite mark?
- No. I got here before they got close.

36:02.460 --> 36:05.327
There was too much blood.
They couldn't see it clearly.

36:07.031 --> 36:10.558
- Bonnie, can we talk about this?
- There's nothing to talk about.

36:11.302 --> 36:12.826
Bonnie, please.

36:14.205 --> 36:17.197
I told you
I wasn't gonna make you choose.

36:17.375 --> 36:20.572
But I need to make the choice
for myself.

36:21.145 --> 36:23.545
Please just leave me alone.

36:35.693 --> 36:39.891
- Jer, you ready?
- Just a sec.

36:45.603 --> 36:47.366
Who's that girl with Jeremy?

36:47.538 --> 36:48.732
His friend Anna.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.174
What's her story?
Why so nosy?

36:51.342 --> 36:54.470
I'm just curious.
He really seems to like her.

36:54.845 --> 36:56.710
She's new in town, I think.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.179
She and her mom, Pearl.

36:59.584 --> 37:03.543
The family you're so rudely trying to
prevent from buying Grayson's building.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.189
Her mother's name is Pearl?

37:06.357 --> 37:08.450
Yes. So?

37:08.626 --> 37:11.527
I believe I already know all about her.

37:14.498 --> 37:17.592
Oh, good. There you are.
Jenna wanted me to get the car.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.196
What happened?

37:25.710 --> 37:29.202
- All right, now this is getting weird.
- We're here to talk.

37:31.616 --> 37:34.380
Not in the mood.
Today has been a no-good, very bad day.

37:34.552 --> 37:38.318
Annabelle tells me you're looking for
something I took from Johnathan Gilbert.

37:39.023 --> 37:41.082
I'm listening.

37:44.662 --> 37:46.630
- What is it?
Johnathan was passionate...

37:46.797 --> 37:49.163
...about his inventions.
He confided in me...

37:49.333 --> 37:51.494
...that he had created
a detection device...

37:51.669 --> 37:54.103
...meant to track
the town's vampire element.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.605
- That was the pocket watch.
That's what it turned out to be, yes.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.838
But that's not what I stole.

38:00.544 --> 38:03.809
I discovered my mistake when I saw
the watch in Johnathan's hand.

38:03.981 --> 38:06.040
The night they took us...

38:06.284 --> 38:08.582
...its dial pointed at me.

38:10.855 --> 38:12.914
- So, what is this?
I have no idea.

38:13.090 --> 38:14.148
But now it's yours.

38:15.826 --> 38:18.294
- What's the catch?
- There is no catch.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.423
My daughter wants to stay here.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.269
I wanna stay here.

38:25.469 --> 38:28.131
You refuse to trust us,
and for good reason.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.570
Consider this an apology.

38:51.195 --> 38:53.186
You shouldn't be here.

38:53.964 --> 38:55.522
I know.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.467
Now you know.

39:02.640 --> 39:03.698
That wasn't you.

39:05.142 --> 39:06.734
Oh, it was absolutely me.

39:07.411 --> 39:10.312
A monster, a predator.
It's who I am, Elena.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.073
That's what the blood makes you.

39:12.249 --> 39:14.217
The blood brings out
what's inside of me.

39:14.385 --> 39:17.013
And if you think any differently,
then you're an idiot.

39:18.155 --> 39:20.055
I know this isn't you, Stefan.

39:20.224 --> 39:25.491
I wanted to drain every ounce of blood
from that girl's body.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.165
- No.
- It's who I am, Elena.

39:28.332 --> 39:29.765
No, you can't scare me off.

39:32.002 --> 39:35.494
- Why would you risk it? Why come here?
- Because I did this.

39:35.673 --> 39:37.903
This is my fault.
I made you drink the blood.

39:38.075 --> 39:40.771
All you did was expose me
to who I really am.

39:40.945 --> 39:44.403
- This isn't you.
- Stop saying that!

39:48.552 --> 39:49.610
Don't get any closer.

39:49.787 --> 39:51.778
- I'm gonna let this happen to you.
- Stop.

39:51.956 --> 39:54.516
I'm not gonna give up on you.
I believe in you.

39:54.692 --> 39:57.718
Stop! Stop!

40:05.603 --> 40:07.400
I'm so sorry.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.766
It's okay.

40:10.808 --> 40:12.708
It's okay.

40:14.445 --> 40:18.108
- I don't know what's happening to me.
- It's okay, Stefan. Shh.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.476
It's okay.

40:20.885 --> 40:22.614
It's okay.

40:28.826 --> 40:30.987
You're gonna be okay.

40:58.355 --> 41:00.289
Are you sure you wanna do this?

41:01.759 --> 41:03.454
I'm sure.

41:10.534 --> 41:12.434
There's no guarantee
this is gonna work.

41:13.337 --> 41:14.770
It has to.

41:21.011 --> 41:22.273
Coming?

41:23.614 --> 41:25.639
I'm gonna stay here.
