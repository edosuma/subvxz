WEBVTT

00:07.970 --> 00:10.069
- What do you think?
- That's good.

00:10.070 --> 00:11.839
Now we're a Jewish home.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.839
I have felt distant
from Ash Park before,

00:14.840 --> 00:16.669
but never alien to it.

00:16.670 --> 00:18.969
God has smiled on us,
Mrs. Bligh.

00:18.970 --> 00:19.670
He has.

00:22.070 --> 00:23.439
You think your shit
doesn't stink.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.540
- How dare you.
- Lady Muck.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.339
That's what they call you.

00:27.340 --> 00:30.239
Shut... your... vicious... mouth!

00:30.240 --> 00:32.539
She's gone, Stan.
Her and the kids.

00:32.540 --> 00:33.669
I'll get you for it.

00:33.670 --> 00:34.869
You and No-Nuts.

00:34.870 --> 00:36.299
You wait!
All of youse.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.539
Dried mud.

00:37.540 --> 00:39.939
Must have been dropped
the night it rained.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.569
It's a strange place for it.

00:41.570 --> 00:43.799
I'm told you didn't see
the vehicle.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.470
Just lights.

00:45.970 --> 00:48.269
Well, I trust you see
justice done.

00:48.270 --> 00:50.599
The median nerve's been cut.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.039
Looks like
you're looking for a surgeon.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.240
And I'm looking for a future.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.199
Give an old flame a kiss?

01:00.200 --> 01:03.369
I want you to do what's right,
and I'm a villain?

01:03.370 --> 01:04.638
I can't be his father

01:04.640 --> 01:06.899
until I know whoever gave him up
doesn't regret it.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.739
I've let enough men control me.

01:09.740 --> 01:11.439
I'll leave
with Georgie tomorrow.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.799
What do you want?

01:12.800 --> 01:15.600
Your help.
You're gonna give it.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.500 --> 01:39.969
Now...

01:39.970 --> 01:42.700
we'd have copped a drenching
without this.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.100
No two ways about that.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.699
Now, if Dawnie was here,
she'd have reminded me

02:03.700 --> 02:06.500
to keep some dry kindling
inside the tent.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.169
Good morning, Mother.

02:42.170 --> 02:45.069
Oh, Sydney, I love you!

02:45.070 --> 02:47.299
London,
I've forgotten your name.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.739
- Here's trouble.
- And, um, what time

02:49.740 --> 02:50.740
do you call this, please?

02:50.741 --> 02:52.299
It was all Delia's fault.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.399
Your fault.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.239
The jazz at El Rocco
was to die for.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.569
- Oh!
- Good!

02:57.570 --> 03:00.299
London clubs are either stuffy
aristocrats or gangsters.

03:00.300 --> 03:03.269
Whereas Sydney clubs are stuffy
aristocrats who are gangsters.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.899
- Ohh!
- Oh, bada-boom-ching.

03:05.900 --> 03:07.870
You know, Georgie's
out fishing with the gardener.

03:08.670 --> 03:11.369
Ah, I should get going,
just in case.

03:11.370 --> 03:12.799
Come on.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.370
A drink to greet the dawn first.

03:16.770 --> 03:19.500
Name one thing the Riviera's
got that we haven't got.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.069
Trick question.

03:22.070 --> 03:25.069
Come on.
Give Cinderella a full report!

03:32.070 --> 03:34.469
Oh, everywhere we went!

03:34.470 --> 03:37.839
Don Burrows played four sets
at the Sky Lounge.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.439
Were you dancing on tables?

03:39.440 --> 03:41.369
Of course.
Topless.

03:41.370 --> 03:44.739
Mama!
You're an unstoppable force.

03:44.740 --> 03:47.069
If I didn't care
for fun and such,

03:47.070 --> 03:49.339
I'd probably amount to much.

03:49.340 --> 03:51.839
But I shall stay the way I am

03:51.840 --> 03:54.069
because I do not give a damn.

03:54.070 --> 03:56.239
So many old pals.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.669
"Carolyn Bligh, where..." Ohh!

03:58.670 --> 04:00.199
Oh, we're loud.
I'm loud.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.839
No, no.
Not at all.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.539
I'm glad you had a good time.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.669
Um, Anna,
have you seen Olivia yet?

04:06.670 --> 04:08.199
She must still be upstairs.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.670
Okay.

04:10.670 --> 04:13.299
Oh, and help yourself
to some breakfast.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.899
You know, just 'cause
Livvy and I are...

04:15.900 --> 04:18.540
Uh, I'll get out of your hair.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.100
Bugger it.

05:03.900 --> 05:05.200
Damn.

05:23.070 --> 05:25.340
I missed you last night.

05:25.900 --> 05:28.500
I couldn't sleep
without you beside me.

05:33.940 --> 05:36.070
These two bits, eh?

05:36.940 --> 05:39.440
Still won't go
where they should.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.300
Thank you.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.439
I have something I need to do
this morning

05:49.440 --> 05:51.639
that I can't cancel.

05:51.640 --> 05:55.070
If it's planned, then,
of course, you should do it.

05:56.070 --> 05:58.369
You know, I'll be
the happiest man in Sydney

05:58.370 --> 06:00.800
if you're still here
when I get back.

06:04.170 --> 06:05.599
Come downstairs.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.839
Anna's up.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.770
Carolyn's home.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.770
I'll buy you breakfast?

06:12.770 --> 06:14.940
I'll be fine, thank you.

06:26.070 --> 06:27.869
For you, ma'am.

06:27.870 --> 06:29.540
Thank you.

06:30.770 --> 06:31.969
Hello?

06:31.970 --> 06:34.640
Just leaving now.

06:49.070 --> 06:51.139
If they had forecast more rain
last night,

06:51.140 --> 06:54.339
I would have called the coppers.
I don't know.

06:54.340 --> 06:56.439
Not that the weather bureau
ever gets it right.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.939
Oh, I keep forgetting
I'm in charge of the menu,

06:58.940 --> 07:00.639
but it's done now,
so we won't starve.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.239
- Morning, Jack.
- Morning.

07:03.240 --> 07:07.840
Jack has a theory
about Henry's accident.

07:09.300 --> 07:12.069
George found
four empty beer bottles

07:12.070 --> 07:14.669
out beside the road caked in mud
earlier last night.

07:14.670 --> 07:17.139
Yes, David was beside himself.

07:17.140 --> 07:18.969
The thing is,
right near where the bottles

07:18.970 --> 07:21.869
had been thrown
were some tire marks.

07:21.870 --> 07:23.239
From a fairly heavy vehicle,

07:23.240 --> 07:24.699
like it'd been parked there
for a while.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.599
Now, it rained the night
of Henry's accident.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.570
Say I'm Stan.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.369
My world's just caved in,
I've had all the trouble

07:32.370 --> 07:34.940
at the hospital,
and my wife and kids are gone.

07:35.540 --> 07:38.469
I'm heading home from the pub
back to my empty house,

07:38.470 --> 07:40.399
and I have to pass this place
staring out at me.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.069
And there is a view
from that spot right up to here.

07:43.070 --> 07:45.599
I sit in my truck,
open one bottle, then another,

07:45.600 --> 07:48.339
to get up some Dutch courage
to do who knows what.

07:48.340 --> 07:51.169
Plus, the sedatives
are still in his system.

07:51.170 --> 07:55.170
And by this stage, I'm lucky to
be able to remember my own name.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.399
Eventually I weave my way home.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.339
And run Henry off the road.

07:59.340 --> 08:01.769
Yeah. I mean, to give him
the benefit of the doubt,

08:01.770 --> 08:03.169
he may not have even noticed.

08:03.170 --> 08:05.169
Whoever caused it
must have seen it

08:05.170 --> 08:06.539
and left him there to die.

08:06.540 --> 08:08.539
If the tire prints
match his truck...

08:08.540 --> 08:11.270
They disappeared
in last night's downpour.

08:13.070 --> 08:15.899
Could get Sergeant Fraser to
check the truck for any damage.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.639
It is rather speculative.

08:17.640 --> 08:21.069
I think he'll want more
than nonexistent tire marks.

08:21.070 --> 08:25.069
I do have an idea,
if you'll leave it with me.

08:25.070 --> 08:26.540
Yeah.

08:30.140 --> 08:34.770
To my working wife,
for her first day back.

08:39.340 --> 08:41.070
Thank you, George.

08:48.970 --> 08:50.740
Ooh.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.439
So, where was I?
Yes.

08:58.440 --> 09:01.669
The minute the sun goes down
on a Friday night, it begins.

09:01.670 --> 09:03.499
So it's not like our Sabbath
at all.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.699
It's all rather... Oh.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.270
Mr. Fox.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.169
Last time I looked,
I hadn't discharged you.

09:10.170 --> 09:12.269
Just keeping an eye
on a patient.

09:12.270 --> 09:13.640
Do you have a moment?

09:16.070 --> 09:18.299
I was just telling Mr. Fox

09:18.300 --> 09:21.469
about the lighting
of the candles at Shabbat.

09:21.470 --> 09:25.269
And little Master Bligh
knowing all those foreign words.

09:25.270 --> 09:27.239
You're welcome next Friday, too,
if you like.

09:27.240 --> 09:30.869
I must say, I'm quite surprised
to see you here so soon.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.369
Ah, yes, back in the saddle.

09:33.370 --> 09:34.969
Bit like Mrs. D'Angelo, really.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.969
Child number four on its way.

09:36.970 --> 09:38.769
Sister Bligh!

09:38.770 --> 09:41.799
Mr. Fox has been up watching her
all through the night.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.639
I tried to tell him
there was no need.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.170
Tell her I'll come in
as soon as I can.

09:48.540 --> 09:52.099
Do you know,
I hadn't quite appreciated

09:52.100 --> 09:55.669
what an endearing young man
Mr. Polson is.

09:55.670 --> 09:58.939
I can well understand why he's
now an intimate at Ash Park.

09:58.940 --> 10:00.300
He's a good stick, Harry.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.740
I'm thinking of inviting him
to afternoon tea.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.999
There are a few of my ladies

10:07.000 --> 10:09.569
whom I fear might be destined
for the shelf.

10:09.570 --> 10:10.939
Who knows?

10:10.940 --> 10:12.839
Cupid's arrow may strike.

10:12.840 --> 10:16.569
He's a very shy man, Doris.

10:16.570 --> 10:18.240
Best left to his own devices.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.339
The Neil Burton?

10:24.340 --> 10:27.039
I assumed he'd have a number
of young up-and-comers

10:27.040 --> 10:28.469
for us to interview,

10:28.470 --> 10:31.369
but his call was to say
that he's interested.

10:31.370 --> 10:33.139
In a transfer.

10:33.140 --> 10:35.740
- Why would he want to come here?
- Thanks very much.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.499
He said something about wanting
a change of scenery.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.369
Permanently?
I mean, not as a locum?

10:41.370 --> 10:43.140
Oh, best thing is to hear
what he has to say.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.539
Get him down here, have a talk.

10:45.540 --> 10:46.839
Neil Burton'll pull up outside,

10:46.840 --> 10:48.369
take one look,
and throw a U-turn.

10:48.370 --> 10:51.440
I can see it now. He'll
disappear in a cloud of dust.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.139
Darling.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.240
Where are you off to?

11:03.070 --> 11:06.100
Somewhere I'd rather not be.

11:06.770 --> 11:10.799
Oh, whatever it is,
bonne chance.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.070
Ma'am?

11:27.940 --> 11:31.339
All I'm asking is that
you put it to her in a way

11:31.340 --> 11:34.070
that she'll listen
and understand.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.969
If you're trying to stop Olivia
from leaving,

11:36.970 --> 11:39.639
you are going the wrong way
about it.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.599
Why not explain this to her
yourself?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.299
'Cause she probably
wouldn't even hear me out.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.899
How on earth
is it any of your business

11:45.900 --> 11:47.599
if you go your separate ways?

11:47.600 --> 11:49.840
A mother sold her baby.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.270
Was she pressured?

11:52.770 --> 11:55.870
Is she searching for him
as we speak?

11:57.070 --> 11:59.340
- This has to be faced.
- Ma'am?

12:00.300 --> 12:02.070
Excuse me, ma'am.

12:02.870 --> 12:04.399
We're here.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.769
Thank you.

12:06.770 --> 12:08.340
- Thank you, driver.
- Thank you.

12:13.070 --> 12:14.839
For Olivia's sake.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.940
Not for yours.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.070
Elizabeth!

12:22.770 --> 12:24.769
Hello.

12:24.770 --> 12:27.070
This is a surprise.

12:28.770 --> 12:31.340
I have an invidious task.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.769
I'm so sorry, Elizabeth.

12:38.770 --> 12:41.469
He had no right to come to you.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.269
It's all been said.

12:43.270 --> 12:47.969
It's Matthew's fervent hope that
you work through this together.

12:47.970 --> 12:50.299
That he might support you

12:50.300 --> 12:52.899
in tracking Georgie's background

12:52.900 --> 12:56.100
so that you can face the outcome
as a couple.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.869
- We have been through this.
- Well, he wanted to make sure

13:01.870 --> 13:04.700
that you understood
his full argument.

13:06.240 --> 13:09.800
What full argument?

13:10.640 --> 13:14.070
He intends to follow through
on tracking Georgie's mother...

13:14.800 --> 13:17.800
...whether or not
you are involved.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.439
I beg your pardon?

13:20.440 --> 13:21.969
He asked me to convey to you

13:21.970 --> 13:24.899
that even if you went back
to Ash Park this morning,

13:24.900 --> 13:28.740
he'll still feel compelled
to investigate.

13:29.370 --> 13:31.839
You can't be serious.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.240
He can't be.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.469
He can't!

13:37.840 --> 13:40.139
What was that charade about
earlier?

13:40.140 --> 13:43.100
"I'll respect your decision"?

13:43.600 --> 13:45.969
How dare he not
tell me this himself?

13:45.970 --> 13:48.069
Well, he was afraid
it might seem like a threat.

13:48.070 --> 13:50.640
It is.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.699
We are leaving
before he gets back.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.669
I am not sure that
that will make any difference.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.539
She gave him up willingly.

13:59.540 --> 14:02.069
She has never bothered
to find him.

14:02.070 --> 14:04.269
Well, as far as anyone knows.

14:04.270 --> 14:06.399
I can see his point.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.969
Even if she could be found,

14:08.970 --> 14:12.400
why stir up painful memories
for her?

14:13.300 --> 14:15.200
Why risk losing my son?

14:16.900 --> 14:18.670
Matthew's waiting for you.

14:20.270 --> 14:22.469
He went to see an old friend
at Manly Beach.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.970
He's waiting for you
in the park.

14:49.300 --> 14:52.539
I can choose to think
that you went to Elizabeth

14:52.540 --> 14:57.070
to try to manipulate me,
to get your own way.

14:57.540 --> 15:03.139
Or... I can choose to think
that you are so committed

15:03.140 --> 15:05.799
to have this resolved
that you...

15:05.800 --> 15:07.770
I don't know.

15:08.670 --> 15:10.400
You tell me.

15:11.840 --> 15:15.140
This is for you and Georgie.

15:15.900 --> 15:17.900
You know how much I love you.

15:20.070 --> 15:24.169
This time last week,
if someone had told me

15:24.170 --> 15:29.940
I'd be giving back your ring
and losing all this...

15:32.540 --> 15:36.470
If everyone had just left us
alone instead of interfering...

15:38.270 --> 15:41.069
If I'd never told you...

15:41.070 --> 15:43.300
But you did.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.470
No secrets.

15:49.070 --> 15:51.640
That's one of the reasons
I fell in love with you.

16:15.770 --> 16:19.169
Well, perhaps I'll be heading up
to Ash Park on my own.

16:19.170 --> 16:21.069
What we should be doing
right now

16:21.070 --> 16:24.499
is going up to that park
and dragging Livvy away.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.839
What will that solve?

16:25.840 --> 16:27.700
She'll thank us 10 years on.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.070
Or not.

16:30.570 --> 16:32.969
Matthew's right
about one thing...

16:32.970 --> 16:35.969
We are all far too enmeshed
in each other's lives.

16:35.970 --> 16:37.699
He said that to you?

16:37.700 --> 16:40.270
He did, and I concur.

16:40.970 --> 16:44.469
Anna will resolve her situation
as best she can,

16:44.470 --> 16:47.070
presumably asking for advice,
should she need it.

16:47.970 --> 16:51.139
- Thank you.
- Olivia the same.

16:51.140 --> 16:54.299
And if any of you hear me
worrying about George and Sarah,

16:54.300 --> 16:57.069
feel free to pull me up.

16:57.070 --> 16:58.299
They're forging a new life,

16:58.300 --> 17:00.440
and they don't need me
in constant commentary.

17:04.300 --> 17:08.270
I thought I should let you know
I'll be staying in town.

17:09.569 --> 17:12.800
We'll work together
to track down the records.

17:13.470 --> 17:14.700
You're sure?

17:21.369 --> 17:23.839
A phone call away.

17:27.300 --> 17:28.769
- Tea?
- Yes, please.

17:28.770 --> 17:30.139
Thank you.

17:30.140 --> 17:33.069
Olivia has excellent instincts.

17:33.070 --> 17:35.740
Ignore them at your peril.

17:46.570 --> 17:48.400
Oooh!

17:54.900 --> 17:57.799
This is from one
of my young ladies.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.369
She so admires the help
you're giving Mr. Briggs.

18:01.370 --> 18:03.240
She asked me to bring this
to you for lunch.

18:04.070 --> 18:07.339
She's a lovely girl.
Charmaine Ford.

18:07.340 --> 18:09.769
Do you know, she's doing
a baked dinner for us tonight.

18:09.770 --> 18:12.069
I thought you might like
to pop along.

18:12.070 --> 18:14.639
Pretty name, isn't it,
Charmaine?

18:14.640 --> 18:18.199
Mrs. Collins,
I'm generally pretty bushed

18:18.200 --> 18:19.399
by the end of the day.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.099
Thanks all the same.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.669
But you have to eat.

18:22.670 --> 18:24.939
I look after myself, but thanks.

18:24.940 --> 18:27.169
Then lunch on Sunday.
Keep the cloth.

18:27.170 --> 18:29.940
You can bring that with you
when you come. Toodle pip!

18:33.300 --> 18:35.969
Goodness.
I'm not sure what to advise.

18:35.970 --> 18:38.400
I thought
you might have a few tips.

18:39.170 --> 18:41.069
Some people
are persistent matchmakers.

18:41.070 --> 18:42.839
I fear Doris is one of them.

18:42.840 --> 18:45.639
- You'll have to...
- Run fast.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.499
...be very...

18:47.500 --> 18:49.170
agile.

18:53.540 --> 18:56.099
Officially discharged,
Sister Bligh.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.069
Well, that is
what we like to hear.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.439
Does she target Mr. Fox,
as well, or am I the lucky one?

19:00.440 --> 19:02.070
What are you talking about?

19:02.700 --> 19:05.700
Mrs. Collins
trying to set me up.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.900
May I have a word
with you outside?

19:24.400 --> 19:26.139
You presume too much.

19:26.140 --> 19:28.339
I am not your friend.

19:28.340 --> 19:30.239
What you mean is,
I'm not your equal.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.399
Let me make this clear.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.699
It is not appropriate for me
in my position here

19:34.700 --> 19:36.369
to chitter-chat with you
about anything,

19:36.370 --> 19:40.069
especially anything to do
with my private life.

19:40.070 --> 19:41.339
Just, out here in the sticks,

19:41.340 --> 19:43.569
it might help to talk
to one of your own kind.

19:43.570 --> 19:44.839
Oh, for God's sake!

19:44.840 --> 19:46.239
So, you only talk to blokes

19:46.240 --> 19:48.069
who've got a posh school tie
in their pocket.

19:48.070 --> 19:50.070
- Look...
- No, you look.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.069
You're a doctor.
You've read Charles Darwin.

19:54.070 --> 19:55.469
You know it's all random.

19:55.470 --> 19:58.669
Our stations in life,
the families we're born into.

19:58.670 --> 20:01.469
Yeah, I've read Darwin's book.
No need to be surprised.

20:01.470 --> 20:02.969
See, you had a family
who could afford to...

20:02.970 --> 20:04.569
- Excuse me!
- You had a family

20:04.570 --> 20:07.299
who could afford
to let you stay at school.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.439
I could have been in your shoes.
You could have been in mine.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.199
But you can't even think that.

20:11.200 --> 20:15.340
Otherwise, all this might crack.

20:34.570 --> 20:38.199
You've heard of
the "surgeon as God" complex?

20:38.200 --> 20:40.500
That was it with wings on.

20:43.340 --> 20:45.969
When I trained
as a nursing sister,

20:45.970 --> 20:48.599
I thought we had it hard.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.139
But surgeons.

20:51.140 --> 20:54.299
Six years studying
for their medical degree.

20:54.300 --> 20:57.539
Then another degree
while working sleepless night

20:57.540 --> 20:59.569
after sleepless night
as a resident.

20:59.570 --> 21:02.869
To England to experience
the best hospitals they can find

21:02.870 --> 21:06.600
and then back here
to compete for positions.

21:08.540 --> 21:11.400
It's not just hard yakka.
It's...

21:12.940 --> 21:15.239
It's a dedication to healing,

21:15.240 --> 21:18.400
every day
since Henry was a young man.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.870
And now he's frightened.

21:27.340 --> 21:30.470
I would be, too,
if I were in his shoes.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.070
Mr. Bligh?

21:42.440 --> 21:44.169
Roy.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.600
Good.

21:46.170 --> 21:47.599
Mr. Bligh...

21:47.600 --> 21:52.500
missy's shindig last night
made a fella realize.

21:53.870 --> 21:55.400
So if that offer's still open...

21:56.700 --> 21:59.440
You stay as long as you like.

22:00.070 --> 22:01.699
There's no need to rush home.

22:01.700 --> 22:04.499
And your timing is perfect.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.369
I, um...

22:06.370 --> 22:08.900
I need a hand.
I'll explain on the way.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.669
Stay there.

22:39.670 --> 22:41.739
You stay there.

23:02.300 --> 23:04.239
...now with
Castle King, Reebers, Joy,

23:04.240 --> 23:06.469
and Maddy's Find
making up the middle pack.

23:06.470 --> 23:09.239
As they round the final turn,
it's Two Bob Watch...

23:09.240 --> 23:10.699
and Sunshine...

23:10.700 --> 23:12.669
...with Mark's Marvel
taking a marvelous lead there.

23:12.670 --> 23:14.239
He's over the line.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.639
Mark's Marvel it is, followed
by Sunshine, Two Bob Watch.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.069
- Mr. O'Rourke.
- What an upset victory

23:19.070 --> 23:21.199
that would be
for Terry Smithers.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.169
Hope you had some good luck
there with race four.

23:24.170 --> 23:27.499
- Morning.
- Come to dance on the grave?

23:27.500 --> 23:29.940
I just thought I'd bring over
the pay that we owe you.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.739
And to say that I'm sorry
for your circumstances.

23:32.740 --> 23:34.839
It can't be easy.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.269
Well, people steal away
your wife and kids.

23:37.270 --> 23:38.640
Happens every day.

23:43.070 --> 23:46.439
But given what was said
to my mother,

23:46.440 --> 23:49.339
I'm sure you'll understand I had
no choice but to let you go.

23:49.340 --> 23:52.500
And I had no choice
but to say it.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.539
Come here.
Come here!

23:59.540 --> 24:01.739
My sister thought
it would help matters.

24:01.740 --> 24:03.469
Your employment.

24:03.470 --> 24:05.639
Might mend some of the, uh...
the anger

24:05.640 --> 24:07.799
you seem to have
towards the women's clinic...

24:07.800 --> 24:09.139
and to us.

24:09.140 --> 24:11.469
I've lost my wife and my kids,

24:11.470 --> 24:13.639
thanks to your missus
and the sheilas in that place.

24:13.640 --> 24:16.069
Well, we can sit down and
talk about that, if you like.

24:16.070 --> 24:18.169
My pay?

24:18.170 --> 24:20.439
Oh, no. Sullivan's Mix
is comin' 'round.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.469
You may want to count that.

24:22.470 --> 24:24.769
But I think it's Ben's Dilemma
that's taken it...

24:24.770 --> 24:28.339
Well, at least I won't have to
hand it over to the missus, eh?

24:28.340 --> 24:31.569
Is there anyone you can talk to?
A priest, perhaps?

24:31.570 --> 24:33.699
Yeah.

24:33.700 --> 24:35.399
Three Hail Marys
from that poofter.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.800
That's just what I need.

24:38.340 --> 24:41.339
...field, Wet Socks and
Bad Angel never in the race

24:41.340 --> 24:42.769
with Kenny's Kid.

24:42.770 --> 24:45.469
Well, I can tell you right now,
he's gonna have to do

24:45.470 --> 24:47.369
some growing up,
the old Kenny's Kid.

24:47.370 --> 24:48.799
But I tell you what, mate.

24:48.800 --> 24:51.170
She's never gonna take
a race...

25:02.940 --> 25:04.469
You flamin' assholes!

25:10.070 --> 25:11.770
Come here.

25:12.870 --> 25:13.770
Come here.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.370
Get up.
Get up.

25:19.970 --> 25:21.639
I couldn't see any damage
to the truck,

25:21.640 --> 25:23.069
'cause the truck's not there.

25:23.070 --> 25:24.739
I reckon he's got rid
of the evidence.

25:24.740 --> 25:27.870
He's a very troubled man.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.169
I'm her fiancé, Dr. Henson.

25:39.170 --> 25:43.899
Olivia Bligh has authorized me
to speak to you on her behalf.

25:43.900 --> 25:48.199
On the 21st of January, 1954,
a child was sold to her

25:48.200 --> 25:50.769
following the stillbirth
of her own child.

25:50.770 --> 25:52.369
You were party to this.

25:52.370 --> 25:56.269
I think you're confusing me
with another doctor.

25:56.270 --> 25:58.969
What exactly
does your fiancée want?

25:58.970 --> 26:03.770
She requires the contact details
of the woman who gave birth.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.839
Otherwise, she'll take
the matter further.

26:06.840 --> 26:10.069
Well, obviously, I
can't give you that information.

26:10.070 --> 26:12.770
May I speak to Mrs. Bligh,
please?

26:13.870 --> 26:16.770
He insists on speaking with you.

26:26.840 --> 26:31.339
I just need to be certain
that the girl or the lady

26:31.340 --> 26:33.540
has no regrets.

26:34.500 --> 26:37.070
For my sake
and that of my child.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.769
And, uh, what makes you think
that I would have such records?

26:41.770 --> 26:47.540
My fiancé and I are determined,
Dr. Henson.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.569
A friend arranged it with you.

26:50.570 --> 26:53.140
A Mr. Andrew Swanson.

26:57.770 --> 27:00.269
I so desperately want
to jazz this place up.

27:00.270 --> 27:01.639
Is it possible, do you think?

27:01.640 --> 27:04.069
Look, we could start with...
with my bedroom.

27:04.070 --> 27:05.569
Something a little more...

27:05.570 --> 27:07.799
appealing
to the gentleman caller?

27:07.800 --> 27:10.499
- One lives in hope.
- Now, the bones of this house

27:10.500 --> 27:12.799
- are never going to be modern.
- Well, nor are mine, dear,

27:12.800 --> 27:14.469
but, goodness,
I give it a red-hot go.

27:14.470 --> 27:16.299
We'll visit Marion Best
together.

27:16.300 --> 27:17.699
- Mm.
- Michael Gerscht.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.369
- Florence Broadhurst.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!

27:20.370 --> 27:22.639
Color and modern lines.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.400
Oh, I love this girl.

27:25.900 --> 27:28.739
Why not bunker down here instead
of rushing to find a place?

27:28.740 --> 27:31.099
- Why not?
- Oh, Prudence, I couldn't.

27:31.100 --> 27:32.100
Persuade her.

27:32.101 --> 27:34.239
There's a raft of rooms
up there.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.239
You can live here
and get a feel for the place.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.140
Oh, what is it you artists say?

27:40.600 --> 27:42.169
Let it speak to you.

27:42.170 --> 27:44.500
Now, really, I must rush.

27:45.370 --> 27:46.969
Have fun.

27:46.970 --> 27:48.469
Oh!

27:48.470 --> 27:51.899
Oh, and, girls, I know
it's not a competition,

27:51.900 --> 27:54.399
but anything that could outdo
the Audette House,

27:54.400 --> 27:55.839
I'd be over the moon.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.969
If I see that place
in one more magazine...

27:58.970 --> 28:01.840
We'll do our best.

28:04.070 --> 28:06.169
Oh.

28:06.170 --> 28:08.469
Should I stay?

28:08.470 --> 28:11.199
Give you a chance
to find a decent flat.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.899
Not so easy at the moment.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.769
Then I will.

28:14.770 --> 28:16.969
We'll be housemates,
as the Yanks say.

28:16.970 --> 28:20.299
We'll have Prudence
and my mother at cocktail hour.

28:20.300 --> 28:22.340
And you.

28:23.900 --> 28:26.799
I just have to say,
I loved last night.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.399
I really did.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.670
It was just like old times.

28:33.540 --> 28:37.439
You know how happy I am
to be working together.

28:37.440 --> 28:40.800
- To learn from you.
- But...

28:42.200 --> 28:47.370
But what happened before...

28:48.170 --> 28:51.500
...that was long ago.

28:53.270 --> 28:54.440
Another lifetime.

28:56.340 --> 28:58.969
Can't wait to meet this chap
who's tamed you.

28:58.970 --> 29:01.840
I haven't been tamed.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.069
Well, that's promising.

29:04.070 --> 29:08.070
But I am in a very,
very loving marriage.

29:12.070 --> 29:15.199
I believe you, Calamity Jane.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.440
Thousands wouldn't.

29:17.600 --> 29:20.070
Now, where would you start...

29:21.840 --> 29:22.870
...partner?

29:25.070 --> 29:27.239
My dear girl, slow down.

29:27.240 --> 29:32.239
He finally agreed
we should come in today at 4:00.

29:32.240 --> 29:33.699
I didn't think
it would be so soon.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.269
What am I going to do?

29:35.270 --> 29:36.869
This is
an appointment, that's all.

29:36.870 --> 29:40.239
One step at a time.
And just remember...

29:40.240 --> 29:42.099
The likelihood is that the woman

29:42.100 --> 29:44.169
has no regrets
about her decision.

29:44.170 --> 29:46.669
The fact that she accepted money
is indicative

29:46.670 --> 29:50.139
of an unfortunate girl
who'd fallen on hard times,

29:50.140 --> 29:51.769
whose life
you, no doubt, helped.

29:51.770 --> 29:53.440
Mummy!

29:54.070 --> 29:55.269
Olivia?

29:55.270 --> 29:59.069
Oh, I have a young man here
on a mission.

29:59.070 --> 30:00.799
I'd better hop off the phone.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.340
Thank you, Elizabeth,
for taking my call.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.499
Here's the boy
with a fish to fry.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.369
Will you come and watch me?

30:10.370 --> 30:13.269
I wouldn't miss it
for all the tea in China.

30:13.270 --> 30:15.999
And all of the tea in Australia
and all of the tea in Hawaii.

30:18.370 --> 30:20.399
Why would he get rid
of his truck

30:20.400 --> 30:21.839
if he didn't think
it'd incriminate him?

30:21.840 --> 30:24.039
Well, the problem is,
he could have taken it anyway.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.799
He could... Ohh.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.899
You kept me busy
with your bullshit

30:28.900 --> 30:30.839
while he takes a gander
out the back.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.639
I was only looking for me dog,
that's all.

30:32.640 --> 30:33.939
You push me any further,

30:33.940 --> 30:36.439
and that stupid mutt of yours
might find itself eating

30:36.440 --> 30:38.369
- the wrong cut of meat.
- Right.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.969
Buried right next
to your missus.

30:39.970 --> 30:41.339
- Hey! All right.
- Scumbag!

30:41.340 --> 30:43.899
- All right, all right.
- You were looking for my truck,

30:43.900 --> 30:45.169
trying to pin that accident
on me.

30:45.170 --> 30:46.339
I'm not an idiot.

30:46.340 --> 30:49.069
Right, where it is
is on loan to a mate...

30:49.070 --> 30:50.469
who needs it more than I do.

30:50.470 --> 30:51.799
You may need to prove that.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.939
When my mate's done using it,
he'll give it back.

30:54.940 --> 30:55.969
You still wanna take me on?

30:55.970 --> 30:58.139
It's best to go now,
Mr. O'Rourke.

30:58.140 --> 31:00.269
- That's all very clear.
- Oh, yeah.

31:00.270 --> 31:02.570
You've got to get back
to your ladies' center.

31:03.140 --> 31:04.739
A lot of blokes I know,
geez, they'd like

31:04.740 --> 31:06.299
to see this place
go up in flames.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.699
But I tell 'em, "Nah.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.500
Does the wives
a world of good to go here."

31:15.240 --> 31:18.269
Best not go to the police
without absolute proof.

31:18.270 --> 31:21.100
And I've already stirred up
a hornet's nest.

31:21.900 --> 31:25.070
He's... He's certainly
a man on the edge.

31:25.670 --> 31:28.370
I just hope we haven't
pushed him too far.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.299
Oh. Poppy.

31:45.300 --> 31:47.800
- Morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

31:48.670 --> 31:50.740
Nice to see you.

32:22.200 --> 32:25.869
Yes, thank you, Mildred.
The hospital, please.

32:25.870 --> 32:27.469
Yes, I am back.

32:27.470 --> 32:30.470
If you could just
put me through, please.

32:35.640 --> 32:38.799
- Henry, you need to know...
- Anna just phoned.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.469
She's back.
Did you know?

32:40.470 --> 32:42.069
From Hawaii? No.

32:42.070 --> 32:44.270
Well, she's here, at Ash Park.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.700
She wants to see me.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.799
Would you call me a taxi,
please?

32:49.800 --> 32:51.600
Of course.

32:58.340 --> 33:00.369
It is you.

33:00.370 --> 33:02.769
I saw your car.
I couldn't believe it.

33:02.770 --> 33:04.369
Why didn't you let us know?

33:04.370 --> 33:06.439
- Hello, Father.
- Hmm? My girl.

33:10.740 --> 33:13.670
- Are you...
- Yes.

33:16.970 --> 33:20.339
And you're still... single.

33:20.340 --> 33:21.739
Yes.

33:21.740 --> 33:23.300
I am.

33:28.870 --> 33:30.799
Is everything all right, Roy?

33:30.800 --> 33:33.470
Yeah. I'm just waiting
for Doris, actually.

33:34.070 --> 33:36.839
You know, you're welcome to have
dinner with us any evening...

33:36.840 --> 33:39.799
or just be quiet at cottage,
whatever you like.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.770
Thank you.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.299
Excuse me, Doris.

33:47.300 --> 33:50.139
Oh. Mr. Briggs.

33:50.140 --> 33:52.699
You're back with us again,
I hope?

33:52.700 --> 33:55.699
- Uh, how are you faring?
- I'm all right.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.139
I figured you'd be
going home soon.

33:58.140 --> 33:59.669
Yeah.

33:59.670 --> 34:02.669
If you could tell young Emma
that I'm gonna be staying

34:02.670 --> 34:03.970
at Ash Park for a while.

34:05.070 --> 34:07.899
I'm not up to going home
just yet.

34:07.900 --> 34:11.570
And that's where I'll be,
if she wants to talk.

34:13.070 --> 34:14.070
I'll let her know.

34:15.300 --> 34:16.969
Good on ya.

34:24.239 --> 34:26.799
Are you sure
this man won't marry you?

34:27.840 --> 34:29.239
What's wrong with men
these days?

34:29.239 --> 34:31.839
I'm not sure
that I want to marry him.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.170
Who is he?
Let me talk to him!

34:35.199 --> 34:37.469
Of course, you're welcome
to stay here at Ash Park

34:37.469 --> 34:38.799
throughout your confinement.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.438
Well, that's an improvement
on Mama's banishment

34:41.440 --> 34:42.539
when she was having me.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.969
But I do mean stay here.

34:44.969 --> 34:47.268
Like it or not, you need to
protect yourself from scandal,

34:47.270 --> 34:48.639
small-town or otherwise.

34:48.639 --> 34:50.369
I intend to look the world
in the eye

34:50.370 --> 34:52.099
and force it
to look straight back.

34:52.100 --> 34:53.870
Oh, good God!

34:54.570 --> 34:56.400
Well, I do!

34:57.540 --> 34:59.599
At least wear a wedding band.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.939
Well, I'll boot my tenants out,

35:01.940 --> 35:04.299
and then I can stay
in my own apartment.

35:04.300 --> 35:06.069
- And then what?
- If I don't marry,

35:06.070 --> 35:08.139
I intend to bring my baby up
on my own.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.069
All children need two parents.

35:10.070 --> 35:12.369
Many do well with one.
Papa, for instance.

35:12.370 --> 35:13.769
His mother was widowed.

35:13.770 --> 35:15.769
It's a completely
different matter!

35:15.770 --> 35:17.569
Only last week,
a woman in the paper

35:17.570 --> 35:20.539
arrested for being a moral
danger to herself and her child,

35:20.540 --> 35:22.899
simply because
she was a single mother.

35:22.900 --> 35:24.599
If that's the full story,

35:24.600 --> 35:27.499
then the police
should be ashamed of themselves.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.139
I have resources, my work.

35:30.140 --> 35:32.339
And I'm not asking
your permission!

35:34.200 --> 35:35.400
Yes, come in.

35:36.270 --> 35:39.070
Mr. Fox to see you, Miss Bligh.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.540
Have him wait in the hallway,
please.

35:49.340 --> 35:50.370
Surely not.

35:54.940 --> 35:57.869
- How?
- Father!

35:57.870 --> 36:00.600
If I see him right now...

36:01.570 --> 36:04.699
Henry has no choice
but to ask for your hand,

36:04.700 --> 36:07.139
and you have no choice
but to accept.

36:07.140 --> 36:10.139
It's the way the world works.

36:10.140 --> 36:13.540
If he wasn't already injured,
I'd knock his bloody block off!

36:34.640 --> 36:38.840
Well, uh, it was
a long time ago.

36:39.340 --> 36:41.199
Five years.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.599
That's not so long.

36:42.600 --> 36:46.699
And if what you described
did happen in this hospital...

36:46.700 --> 36:48.939
You know it did.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.569
Still does, for all we know.

36:51.570 --> 36:53.599
Absolutely not.

36:53.600 --> 36:57.070
I'm sure that won't stop the
police from being interested.

36:59.200 --> 37:03.140
If you can't give us what we
want, that'll be our next stop.

37:04.900 --> 37:09.069
Should this have happened,
you've as much to lose in this

37:09.070 --> 37:11.569
as anyone else
who might have been involved.

37:11.570 --> 37:13.099
I'm not sure
what you hope to achieve.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.799
We want you to find the records.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.669
I don't know if they've been
kept or where they'd be.

37:17.670 --> 37:19.369
Think of all the patients
who've been through

37:19.370 --> 37:20.699
this hospital since then.

37:20.700 --> 37:23.370
Well, the police will help
if you can't.

37:26.100 --> 37:29.099
We'll call again
same time tomorrow.

37:29.100 --> 37:31.400
See how you've progressed.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.469
A car accident?

37:48.470 --> 37:50.899
No one told me anything.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.399
It looks dreadful.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.639
They love their plaster of Paris
in Inverness.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.539
It's serious?

37:56.540 --> 37:58.969
I may not play the violin again,
let's put it that way.

37:58.970 --> 38:00.939
Could you play it before,
Mr. Fox?

38:00.940 --> 38:04.600
Is it as bad as it looks?

38:06.700 --> 38:07.540
Yes.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.839
Would it help to hear
some potentially good news?

38:11.840 --> 38:12.970
Hit me with it.

38:13.600 --> 38:17.200
You, Mr. Fox,
are going to be a father.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.500
Are you going to cry?

38:33.740 --> 38:36.269
I'm uncharacteristically
lost for words.

38:36.270 --> 38:39.769
I'm... Just, it's

38:39.770 --> 38:41.499
I'm over the moon.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.139
In orbit.
Well done.

38:43.140 --> 38:45.140
10 out of 10?

38:46.700 --> 38:48.200
Children need a mother
and father.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.469
You and I
will be so good at this.

38:51.470 --> 38:53.900
"The Adventures
of Ozzie and Harriet."

38:56.070 --> 38:58.070
We will be the best.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.970
Miss Bligh, will you marry me?

39:05.340 --> 39:08.469
I think we keep the light
fitting in the living area.

39:08.470 --> 39:09.639
For now.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.170
Good idea.

39:13.900 --> 39:15.699
That's what it is.

39:15.700 --> 39:18.870
It bugged me all last night.

39:23.070 --> 39:25.699
You're still wearing
Heaven Sent.

39:25.700 --> 39:27.700
When you're on a good thing.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.339
Just now spoke to Neil Burton.

39:41.340 --> 39:43.139
He'll be down tomorrow
to see us.

39:43.140 --> 39:46.539
I'd prefer the day after,
but tomorrow suits him best.

39:46.540 --> 39:48.670
Well, good.

39:49.170 --> 39:51.070
I take it you don't know
that Anna came back today.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.769
- Anna, back from Hawaii?
- Mm.

39:54.770 --> 39:57.770
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.700
You might want to sit down,
though.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.770
With your permission,
and George's pending...

40:04.970 --> 40:06.700
...I've just asked her
to marry me.

40:08.100 --> 40:10.539
For real this time.

40:10.540 --> 40:13.139
I know she'll want to give you
the full details herself.

40:13.140 --> 40:15.270
Is this some sort of joke?

40:16.200 --> 40:17.370
You're having me on, right?

40:19.900 --> 40:21.599
Henry wouldn't suggest this

40:21.600 --> 40:23.469
if he didn't think
you could both make it work.

40:23.470 --> 40:26.369
We could make a good couple.

40:26.370 --> 40:28.069
But I'm worried
he's only proposed

40:28.070 --> 40:30.369
because of the baby,
not because of me.

40:30.370 --> 40:31.839
Well, the outcome
would be the same.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.899
Well, as open-minded as I am,

40:33.900 --> 40:36.070
do think of the pros
and the cons.

40:37.300 --> 40:40.469
Whatever mistakes have been made
in similar marriages,

40:40.470 --> 40:42.399
we could do it.

40:42.400 --> 40:45.639
And in a few years' time,

40:45.640 --> 40:48.139
you won't even think
about how or why you married,

40:48.140 --> 40:51.470
only how much
you both love your child.

40:53.640 --> 40:57.639
But then, the other part of me,
I want to be proud.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.439
To stand up without shame...

40:59.440 --> 41:02.139
and to lead the way
for all women

41:02.140 --> 41:03.399
who shouldn't be forced to marry

41:03.400 --> 41:05.839
and shouldn't be forced
to give up their babies.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.399
Society's going
to have to catch up.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.900
Don't tell me you're
stupid enough to marry Henry.

41:10.970 --> 41:12.199
All right, I won't.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.499
He's a ruddy shirt-lifter!

41:14.500 --> 41:16.199
Stop it.
Don't say that.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.939
I mean, what the hell
are you thinking of?!

41:17.940 --> 41:19.499
- Jack!
- What, he doesn't deserve

41:19.500 --> 41:20.569
to see his child grow up?

41:20.570 --> 41:22.699
- Is that what you're saying?
- What?

41:22.700 --> 41:25.069
- I don't think he does, no.
- Now, that's enough.

41:25.070 --> 41:27.469
Okay, so, all the years
that you didn't know about me,

41:27.470 --> 41:28.769
was that because
you didn't deserve it?

41:28.770 --> 41:29.799
Well, that's not the same.

41:29.800 --> 41:31.069
I can't see why not.

41:31.070 --> 41:32.599
You do not settle
for half a man!

41:32.600 --> 41:34.400
Well, Mama did,
so why shouldn't I?

41:39.500 --> 41:42.069
I did not mean that.
I'm sorry.

41:42.070 --> 41:44.970
Papa. I'm sorry!

42:44.400 --> 42:46.070
I'll get youse.

42:48.070 --> 42:49.900
Bugger ya!

42:57.900 --> 43:00.070
This'll show 'em.

43:23.070 --> 43:24.439
Hold on to the knot there.
That's it.

43:24.440 --> 43:26.739
All right, pull this.
That's it.

43:26.740 --> 43:28.139
Then you hold that,
and you pull it.

43:28.140 --> 43:29.499
- Yes.
- There you go.

43:29.500 --> 43:32.399
- Good boy!
- Yes.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.240
- So, that will help it sink.
- Yes, we will.

43:35.940 --> 43:37.270
Yeah.

43:39.070 --> 43:43.599
The, uh, papers have been found.

43:43.600 --> 43:45.669
He wants to see us.

43:45.670 --> 43:47.200
Tomorrow.

43:48.370 --> 43:49.840
Great.

43:56.440 --> 43:58.540
You play with it for a bit.
