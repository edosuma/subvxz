We have to lodge a complaint
so they'll find him.

40:49.697 --> 40:50.989
How will they do it?

40:51.699 --> 40:53.826
He left his pickup.

40:53.910 --> 40:57.538
He also forgot his phone, but the line's cut.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.375
Who was it?

41:04.629 --> 41:08.423
The neighbors say the old tenant
was promiscuous.

41:09.801 --> 41:13.303
That jerk must have been a client of hers.

41:16.850 --> 41:18.350
Do you remember his face?

41:19.227 --> 41:20.227
No.

41:20.937 --> 41:22.396
Didn't you see him?

41:31.823 --> 41:33.490
Come inside, it's cold.

41:47.547 --> 41:48.589
Let me serve you.

41:55.889 --> 41:57.264
Who got me out of the bathroom?

41:59.976 --> 42:01.310
A neighbor.

42:02.562 --> 42:03.770
Which one?

42:03.855 --> 42:05.731
I have no idea. Who cares?

42:09.819 --> 42:13.197
Have your breakfast and go to sleep.

42:17.202 --> 42:20.829
I can't. As soon as I close my eyes,
I see it all again.

42:30.924 --> 42:32.257
How did he get in?

42:34.969 --> 42:37.679
I let him in. I was waiting for you.

42:38.640 --> 42:43.393
I came out of the bathroom,
buzzed the door open and went back in.

42:50.860 --> 42:54.571
I was washing my hair.
I felt someone had come in.

42:56.532 --> 42:59.868
He stroked my hair, I thought it was you.

43:01.496 --> 43:04.539
Then I saw his hands
and I can't remember anything else.

-We can't do anything.

in front of everybody.

45:11.292 --> 45:12.334

45:31.646 --> 45:34.940

45:35.400 --> 45:39.069
They seem to laugh at me.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.654
Why?

45:41.197 --> 45:44.282
Why would they laugh at you?

45:44.367 --> 45:47.494
They just pass me by.

45:48.371 --> 45:52.332
They ignore me. I’m not noticed.

46:50.725 --> 46:55.520
You always tell me that, Linda.
You tell me, but it doesn't help.

46:55.605 --> 46:57.939
I can never satisfy you,

46:58.107 --> 47:00.775

47:00.860 --> 47:03.069

But I tried...

Why are you crying?

47:14.123 --> 47:15.665
Linda, come back.

47:21.088 --> 47:22.547
I’m sorry.

47:22.632 --> 47:25.008
We have to interrupt the play.

47:26.761 --> 47:28.803
My partner and wife is ill.

47:28.888 --> 47:32.432
We'd like a 1 0-minute break,
and we thank you.

47:36.395 --> 47:37.687
Can you go on?

47:37.772 --> 47:40.190
You see she can't.

47:40.274 --> 47:42.359
Find some way to cancel.

47:42.443 --> 47:45.403
Do you want to lie down next door?

of the audience bothered me.

48:31.325 --> 48:34.703
They've come here to look at you.

He had the guy's gaze.

49:10.197 --> 49:13.658
You didn't think to tell me
who lived there before us?

49:13.743 --> 49:16.119
-Why?
-You're supposed to be my friend.

49:16.203 --> 49:20.123

knows that apartment.

No one.

49:26.631 --> 49:29.049
Why doesn't she come for her stuff?

49:29.133 --> 49:30.967
But I wanted to help you.

49:31.052 --> 49:34.721
Did you forget you were about
to come and sleep here?

49:34.805 --> 49:37.557
Was that a reason to hide who she was?

49:37.642 --> 49:39.225
What do you mean, "hide"?

49:40.227 --> 49:41.936
Did you warn me?

49:42.021 --> 49:43.396
About what?

49:43.481 --> 49:48.401
Should I have repeated gossip
so you'd go there unwillingly?

49:49.111 --> 49:50.528
What happened?

49:50.613 --> 49:52.113
I’m going, BABAK.

49:56.702 --> 49:59.287
They told me she slipped in the shower.

50:02.625 --> 50:05.251
We even spoke about having a child there,

50:05.336 --> 50:07.045
and you told us nothing.

50:07.129 --> 50:09.798
You were joking.

50:10.383 --> 50:12.926
Otherwise, you'd have told us?

50:13.010 --> 50:16.012
Told you what? What's got into you?

have passed through our bedroom.

they're wet.

Ln fact, I almost called the cleaner

50:58.973 --> 51:02.851
to tell him to come earlier this week.

51:02.935 --> 51:05.145
But I thought you'd go to the police,

51:05.312 --> 51:07.689
and we had to leave the traces.

51:08.149 --> 51:10.024
Nothing serious happened.

51:10.359 --> 51:14.738
It's obvious you're not the one
who found your wife the other day,

51:14.822 --> 51:17.240
otherwise you wouldn't say that.

51:18.409 --> 51:21.703

-Don't go today.

51:59.492 --> 52:03.787

It's not a solution.

52:04.705 --> 52:06.748
I can't stay here alone.

52:08.501 --> 52:10.293
I don't want to be here alone.

Either we go to the police,
or we forget this whole story.

01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:15.706
Call him and tell him to come.

01:28:16.375 --> 01:28:18.542
I want to ask him who it was.

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:23.589
He's buying wedding stuff
with my wife and daughter.

01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:25.967
Well, call him

01:28:26.969 --> 01:28:30.221
and ask him who had the pickup that night.

01:28:31.014 --> 01:28:32.181
When was it?

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:33.891
Two weeks ago.

01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:42.108
Okay, let me speak to him tonight.

01:28:44.778 --> 01:28:47.154
But I want to speak to him...

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:49.740
Wait. I want to speak to him.

01:28:50.409 --> 01:28:51.951
Call him.

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:54.203
I don't have his number.

01:28:55.122 --> 01:28:56.205
I’ve got it.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.543
I want you to tell him to come,

01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:03.212
so I don't have to go to his shop.

01:29:03.296 --> 01:29:06.382
First, let me make sure it was him.

01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:09.135
I need to speak to him...

01:29:09.219 --> 01:29:11.846
Otherwise I’ll call myself.

01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:12.930
Shall we do that?

01:29:15.892 --> 01:29:18.060
I’ll call.

01:29:31.658 --> 01:29:34.493
Majid? Hello, son.

01:29:34.578 --> 01:29:36.287
Where are you?

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:39.165
Yes, at the gentleman's.

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:42.918
Who are you with?

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.757
Call me when you're alone.

01:29:47.841 --> 01:29:49.592
We need to talk.

01:29:51.845 --> 01:29:53.387
At my number.

01:29:55.098 --> 01:29:57.725
I don't know it. Ask Mojgan.

01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:01.353
Okay.

01:30:01.897 --> 01:30:03.355
Nothing serious.

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:05.566
Bye.

01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:09.528
He'll call when he's alone.

01:30:10.822 --> 01:30:12.573
What do you do?

01:30:14.076 --> 01:30:16.368
I work with Majid's pickup.

01:30:17.204 --> 01:30:20.289
I sell clothes by the roadside in the evenings.

01:30:20.373 --> 01:30:23.334
I don't go out during the day
because of my heart.

01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:25.377
Tell me something,

01:30:26.296 --> 01:30:29.757
how come you don't have
your son-in-law's number?

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:30.883
Well, I don't.

01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:33.427
I don't have many numbers.

01:30:33.512 --> 01:30:34.845
Have you just changed phones?

01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:37.014
No.

(KEYS JANGLING)

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:58.494
How come he doesn't have your number?

01:30:59.329 --> 01:31:02.289
You told him to ask somebody, didn't you?

01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:04.333
I don't know...

01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:08.546
I’m so upset, I don't even know who I am.

01:31:11.591 --> 01:31:13.384
-Wait.
-It's locked?

01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:15.761
Wait for a bit.

01:31:17.097 --> 01:31:19.807
Could you take off your shoes?

01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:21.100
What for?

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.310
I want to see your feet.

01:31:24.146 --> 01:31:28.274
I could be your father! Let me go!

01:31:28.358 --> 01:31:32.236
Fine, no need to get excited.

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.531
Take them off and I’ll let you go.

01:31:35.615 --> 01:31:39.743
Why should I? Open this door!

01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:41.495
Come here.

01:31:41.955 --> 01:31:44.582
Please. Come here.

01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:55.176
Sit, and take off your shoes.

01:31:57.137 --> 01:32:01.473
Sit down.

01:32:03.185 --> 01:32:04.351
Go on, sit.

01:32:10.734 --> 01:32:13.694
-Take them off.
-I don't feel well.

01:32:13.778 --> 01:32:15.362
I’ll help you.

01:32:15.447 --> 01:32:17.323
I’ll do it.

01:32:28.418 --> 01:32:29.668
The other one, too.

01:32:30.170 --> 01:32:31.212
Okay.

01:32:38.011 --> 01:32:39.470
The socks.

01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:44.391
-What do you want with me?
-Take them off.

01:32:44.476 --> 01:32:46.310
I’ll do it for you.

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:48.854
Let me do it.

01:34:11.104 --> 01:34:12.104
No.

01:34:12.188 --> 01:34:13.522
I’m busy.

01:34:14.733 --> 01:34:15.858
What's the time?

01:34:17.944 --> 01:34:19.737
I won't be long, don't worry.

01:34:21.948 --> 01:34:23.532
She'll make her own way.

01:34:24.534 --> 01:34:26.118
She's got things to do.

01:34:26.202 --> 01:34:27.578
Yes, I’m fine.

01:34:28.788 --> 01:34:29.997
See you later.

01:34:32.125 --> 01:34:35.461
I swear I didn't want to bother anybody.

01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:40.174
Did that woman ask you to come?

01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:43.052
She'd been texting me for a month.

01:34:43.136 --> 01:34:48.265
"If you've got the pickup, drop by,
I’ve got a favor to ask."

01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:50.559
And I replied, "Ahoo, dear,

01:34:50.643 --> 01:34:54.021
"sorry, I’m sick, I can't come."

01:34:54.731 --> 01:34:55.981
She got annoyed.

01:34:56.066 --> 01:35:00.611
She wouldn't answer my texts or calls.

01:35:01.237 --> 01:35:02.363
She was sulking.

01:35:03.239 --> 01:35:05.532
That night, I wanted to make up...

01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:07.534
You didn't know she'd left?

01:35:07.619 --> 01:35:09.703
No, on my children's heads.

01:35:09.788 --> 01:35:11.789
You went into the apartment,

01:35:11.873 --> 01:35:15.334
you must've seen it had changed.

01:35:15.418 --> 01:35:20.798
I saw the mess, the bike I got the kid...

01:35:22.258 --> 01:35:23.717
I thought she was moving.

01:35:23.802 --> 01:35:26.387
Tell the truth and you can go.

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:29.473
If I’d have thought you moved in,

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:33.310
I’d have been afraid a man was in the shower.

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:34.895
My wife's clothes were on the bed.

01:35:34.979 --> 01:35:35.979
I saw nothing.

01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:40.109
You saw there was a woman alone,
and she let you in...

01:35:40.193 --> 01:35:41.902
I didn't see any clothes.

01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:46.240
Lt happened really fast.
I came in, there was no one.

01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:49.451
And your wife had just let me in.

01:35:49.536 --> 01:35:51.453
Why did she open the door?

01:35:51.538 --> 01:35:53.080
She thought it was me.

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:55.290
I’m telling you straight.

01:35:55.375 --> 01:35:58.627
I went to the bathroom door
and called the kid.

01:35:59.254 --> 01:36:01.130
Then she started screaming.

01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:03.924
-I took off.
-You went in.

01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:05.634
I didn't.

01:36:05.718 --> 01:36:09.012
-How did you cut yourself, then?
-No idea.

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:13.350
Downstairs, my foot hurt.
I guess I cut myself on the stairs.

01:36:13.435 --> 01:36:15.894
-So my wife's lying?
-She says I went in?

01:36:15.979 --> 01:36:18.480
If she'd not flung herself at the glass in fear,

01:36:18.565 --> 01:36:21.442
what would you have done to her, bastard?

01:36:21.901 --> 01:36:23.444
I swear to you,

01:36:23.528 --> 01:36:27.281
I fled when I realized my mistake.

01:36:27.365 --> 01:36:29.450
Ask your wife.

01:36:29.534 --> 01:36:32.119
I’ll stay here, bring her.

01:36:32.203 --> 01:36:33.454
To say what?

01:36:35.206 --> 01:36:38.959
She's already said it all. It's your wife's turn.

01:36:39.043 --> 01:36:41.837
Call her and tell her to come.

01:36:41.921 --> 01:36:44.590
-Why?
-You can repeat it all to her.

01:36:44.674 --> 01:36:47.509
I swear I didn't go in the bathroom.

01:36:47.594 --> 01:36:49.303
Okay.

01:36:49.387 --> 01:36:52.431
Explain to your wife why you were there.

01:36:52.515 --> 01:36:53.682
Call her.

01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:56.101
Get your phone out.

01:36:56.603 --> 01:36:58.187
Get it, I’m telling you.

01:37:03.151 --> 01:37:05.152
Don't humiliate me in front of my family.

01:37:05.612 --> 01:37:06.695
Call her.

01:37:07.155 --> 01:37:10.532
-My daughter's getting married.
-She should know her father.

01:37:11.117 --> 01:37:15.787
I’ll tell your son-in-law everything
so he knows his father-in-law.

I don't need you, get lost.

01:37:20.418 --> 01:37:23.754
