- Still a bit stiff.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.960
It can get awfully hairy out there.

I'm surprised you werert snapped up

Your arrest record is 400% higher
than any other officer.

that such skills were put to better use.

to transfer to the country.

Hang on, I don't remember telling you that.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.600
Yes, you did. You said,

"I'd love to settle down
in the country sometime, Janine."

- Right. Then where are you living?
- He's staying at the Section House, sir.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.360
- With the recruits?
- Yes, he's living out of cardboard boxes.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.240
Well, then, you're packed already.

- Yes, yes, I do.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.160

the Chief Inspector with this?

04:12.240 --> 04:13.280
Yes.

You want me to get the Chief Inspector
to come all the way down here?

you'll continue to be exceptional
and we can't have that.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.000
You'll put us all out of a job.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.000
With respect, sir.

04:51.080 --> 04:56.200
- You can't just make people disappear.
- Yes, I can. I'm the Chief Inspector.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.280
Well, however you spin this, there's
one thing you haven't taken into account.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.800

"the service" now.

that "force" is too aggressive.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.200
- Well, how's our guest?
- Guest?

14:49.280 --> 14:53.720
- The inebriate in cell four.
- I don't know. Nobody tells me nothing.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.720
Can I get cell four open, please?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.800
Danny, can you open four?

15:05.240 --> 15:09.520
- He's gone.
- Oh, my God. Who's gone?

15:12.400 --> 15:16.400
- Why are you dressed like a police officer?
- Because I am one.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.560
Sergeant Angel, at last. Frank Butterman.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.640
- I see you've already met my boy.
- Yes.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.680
FRANK: Do forgive me.
I'm something of a Wild West nut.

15:28.760 --> 15:32.920
Speaking of which, that was a fair
few outlaws you rounded up last night.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.600
Thank you, sir.

15:34.680 --> 15:39.400
I admire your enthusiasm
and far be it from me to stifle your flair,

15:39.480 --> 15:42.080
but this isn't London.
Oh, yes, please, Danny.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.240
With respect, sir,

15:43.320 --> 15:46.440
geographical location shouldn't factor
in the application of the law.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.760
No, thanks.

15:47.840 --> 15:51.600
Statistically, Sandford is
the safest village in the country.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.800
But that doesn't mean
it requires anything less

15:53.880 --> 15:56.240
than a careful and considered approach.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.120
There's a reason we accommodate
a few of the younglings at the pub.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.560
- The greater good?
- The greater good. Precisely.

16:02.640 --> 16:06.760
Your predecessor assumed
that rural policing was easy.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.480
Ended up having a nervous breakdown.

16:09.560 --> 16:13.520
And Sergeant Popwell was
an exceptional officer, truly exceptional.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.200
And he had one thing you haven't got.

16:16.280 --> 16:19.080
- What's that, sir?
- A great big bushy beard.

16:19.160 --> 16:21.160
Come on, let's have a mosey around.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.680
Locker room.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.440
Riot room.

16:29.560 --> 16:30.960
Evidence room.

16:33.760 --> 16:37.680
Now, how about a trip to the Andes?

16:37.760 --> 16:41.440
Detective Sergeant Wainwright
and Detective Constable Can'twright.

16:41.520 --> 16:42.760
(PHONE RINGING)

16:42.840 --> 16:44.320
Don't get up.

16:45.480 --> 16:48.040
I expect you're wondering
why we call them the Andes.

16:48.120 --> 16:51.640
- They're both called Andrew?
- They said you were good.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.280
Also, because talking to them is
an uphill struggle, isn't it, Dad?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.600
- Fuck off!
- Thank you, Danny.

16:58.720 --> 16:59.760
(READING)

17:02.440 --> 17:05.400
And this is where it all happens.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.920
That is Sergeant Tony Fisher.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.240
PC Bob Walker.

17:10.319 --> 17:11.560
(MUMBLING)

17:11.640 --> 17:12.920
And that is Saxon.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.480
And this is one Doris Thatcher.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.560
- She's our only policewoman.
- She's not a policewoman.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.760
- Yeah, she is. I've seen her bra.
- She's a police officer.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.240
Being a woman has nothing to do with it.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.319
Oh, I don't know.
Comes in handy every so often.

17:25.640 --> 17:29.000
I could've given you the tour.
I've been round the station a few times.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.720
And what's upstairs?

17:32.400 --> 17:34.880
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.160
Nicholas, this is Tom Weaver.

17:37.520 --> 17:40.800
Civilian liaison
with the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.880
You'll find that we run
a very tight ship here.

17:45.280 --> 17:50.360
From this command centre
I can see what the whole village is up to.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.800
I must say I was rather admiring
your handiwork last night.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.360
It's a pity you didn't do the same
to those bloody hoodies.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.960
Hanging around. Loitering. Sitting.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.360
Actually, I did notice some minor graffiti
on the fountain.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.680
Graffiti? They've gotta be dealt with, Frank.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.920
They're nippers, Tom. They'll come round.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.200
Which reminds me,

18:08.280 --> 18:11.480
our friend, The Living Statue,
was here on Saturday.

18:11.560 --> 18:16.400
11:00, 12:00, 1:00, 2:00.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.200
If we don't come down hard
on these clowns,

18:19.280 --> 18:23.360
- we are gonna be up to our balls in jugglers.
- We'll get right onto it, Tom.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.840
We like to let them think they run the place.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.600
Well, that's that.

18:29.680 --> 18:32.000
Unless there's anything
you're unclear about?

18:32.080 --> 18:35.160
Yes, sir.
Why is everybody eating chocolate cake?

18:35.240 --> 18:39.320
The Black Forest gateau is on Danny.
As punishment for his little indiscretion.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.440
His...

18:40.520 --> 18:43.720
Sir, I don't think driving under the influence
can be called a "little indiscretion."

18:43.800 --> 18:46.840
No, the gateau is for misplacing
his helmet the other week.

18:46.920 --> 18:50.720
Last night's incident will require
something rather more serious.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.000
- Good.
- Do you like ice-cream?

18:53.080 --> 18:54.760
I'm sorry, sir, I don't follow.

18:54.840 --> 18:58.440
Let's just say that we won't be short
of Chunky Monkey for the next month.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.200
Dad.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.920
Now, since it's your first day
and it's 11:30, I'd say that's lunch.

19:09.960 --> 19:14.400
So, what made you choose Sandford then,
Sergeant Angel?

19:14.480 --> 19:16.040
It wasrt actually my choice.

19:16.120 --> 19:20.120
Oh, right, right, wasrt your choice to come
down here and tell me how to do my job.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.360
Our jobs.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.240
(CHATTERING INCOHERENTLY)

19:23.320 --> 19:24.360
ALL: Yeah.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.080
Look, I can assure you it wasrt
my intention to upset the apple can't.

19:28.160 --> 19:31.280
Yeah, 'cause we all sell apples round here,
don't we?

19:31.360 --> 19:34.080
- Your dad sells apples, Andy.
- And raspberries.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.640
I bet you can't wait to jump
into Sergeant Popwell's grave.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.800
I'm not jumping into anyone's grave.

19:40.040 --> 19:43.240
- You got a moustache.
- I know.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.920
- Why have you got your stab vest on?
- It's a requirement.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.120
In the city maybe.
Nobody's gonna stab you in here, Sergeant.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.320
Not a member of the public anyhow.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.960
- Have you been stabbed, Sergeant Fisher?
- No.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.400
Well, I have.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.960
And I can assure you
it is not in the least bit amusing.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.000
Have you seen a lot of action,
Sergeant Angel?

20:06.080 --> 20:07.920
I've experienced my fair share, yes.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.400
- Did you cook any fools?
- Excuse me?

20:10.480 --> 20:11.680
Did you shoot anybody?

20:11.760 --> 20:14.960
He shot a crack head with a Kalashnikov.

20:15.480 --> 20:19.080
- Where did you get that?
- The offender had the Kalashnikov.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.200
Where'd he get that?

20:20.280 --> 20:23.360
You do know there are more guns
in the country than there are in the city?

20:23.440 --> 20:26.360
Everybody and their mums
is packing round here.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.040
- Like who?
- Farmers.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.520
- Who else?
- Farmers's mums.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.320
What's it like being stabbed?

20:38.920 --> 20:42.120
It was the single most painful
experience of my life.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.480
What was the second most painful?

20:50.680 --> 20:51.680
You ever fired two guns
whilst jumping through the air?

20:51.720 --> 20:52.680
No.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.680
You ever fired one gun
whilst jumping through the air?

20:53.720 --> 20:54.680
No.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.680
- Ever been in a high speed pursuit?
- Yes, I have.

20:55.720 --> 20:56.680
You ever fired a gun
whilst in a high speed pursuit?

20:56.720 --> 20:58.400
No.

20:58.880 --> 21:03.000
<i>AMANDA ON WALKIE-TALKIE: Annette,</i>
<i>that Sergeant Angel's coming into your shop.</i>

21:03.080 --> 21:04.680
<i>Get a look at his arse.</i>

21:05.320 --> 21:07.440
- What about <i>Lethal Weapon?</i>
- No.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.440
- You've seen <i>Die Hard,</i> though?
- No.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.080
<i>- Bad Boys II?</i>
- No.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.800
You ain't seen <i>Bad Boys II?</i>

21:16.640 --> 21:18.440
- Hell of a day, huh?
- Yeah.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.040
- Same again tomorrow?
- Yeah.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.720
Amanda Paver,
headmistress of Sandford Primary.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.160
How do you do, Sergeant?

21:30.240 --> 21:34.880
- Simon Skinner, I believe you've met.
- Oh, we're already firm friends.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.880
Oh, please, please, come with me, will you?

21:36.960 --> 21:38.760
This is Leslie Tiller,

21:39.040 --> 21:43.000
whose horticultural expertise
has helped put Sandford on the map.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.480
- She's ever so good.
- Oh, go on.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.880
This is James Reaper,
who owns Brannigan Farm.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.600
I hear you're quite the marksman.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.040
Perhaps you might like to join us
for a shoot one day.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.560
Well, I haven't held a firearm
for over two years, Mr Reaper.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.200
I'd quite like to keep it that way.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.960
You will be popular with the local birds.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.680
Birds.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.840
Nicholas, hello. Reverend Shooter.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.440
I want to ask you,
would you read a homily at Sunday Service?

22:06.520 --> 22:08.520
That might be
a little hypocritical of me, Reverend.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.760
Oh, you're an atheist?

22:10.840 --> 22:12.240
No, I'm... I'm...

22:12.320 --> 22:15.240
I'm open to the concept of religion,
I'm just not entirely convinced by it.

22:15.320 --> 22:17.840
- You're an agnostic?
- I think I have a cream for that.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.920
Robin Hatcher, our resident sawbones.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.800
Hopefully we won't see too much
of each other over the coming months.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.520
Well, all that remains is to welcome you

22:28.600 --> 22:33.000
to the weekly meeting
of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.200
Now, quick announcement before we begin.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.840
Janet Barker has just given birth to twins.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.120
So, congratulations to her.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.400
- Tom?
- Thanks, Joyce.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.000
Now.

22:48.720 --> 22:53.480
I am sure that all of you will have noticed
the return of a blight to our streets.

22:53.560 --> 22:57.720
It's made all the more disturbing as
the Village of the Year contest looms.

22:58.440 --> 23:03.360
I refer, of course,
to the extremely irritating Living Statue.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.440

23:11.760 --> 23:13.520
<i>as it is about fighting crime.</i>

23:13.600 --> 23:16.960
Most importantly,
it is about procedural correctness

23:17.040 --> 23:20.320
in the execution
of unquestionable moral authority.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.720
Any questions?

23:24.960 --> 23:26.160
Yes.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.840
Is it true that there is a place
in a mars head

23:28.920 --> 23:30.960
that if you shoot it, it will blow up?

for the <i>Sandford Citizen?</i>

23:38.480 --> 23:39.600
Okay.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.720
How about you put the teacher
in handcuffs?

23:41.800 --> 23:43.240
I don't think that gives off the right signals.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.120
Too cheesy-pie. Okay. Gotcha.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.520
- Give the little blonde kid your hat.
- I'd rather not.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.800
- Wave your hitting stick about.
- No.

Yes, Mr Staker. We'll do everything we can.

- Long slender neck.
- Yeah.

- There is always something going on.

- Mr Treacher?
- Yeah.

Why has he got that big coat on?

25:24.600 --> 25:28.280
He can't be cold. Why the extra layer?
Maybe he's trying to hide something.

Mr Treacher?

25:31.160 --> 25:32.440
Okay. What about this guy?

25:32.520 --> 25:34.880
Ask yourself, why has he got his hat
pulled down like that?

25:34.960 --> 25:38.120
- He's fuck ugly.
- Or he doesn't want you to see his face.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.160
Because he's fuck ugly.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.240
Okay, what's his story?

And lives up Summer Street
with his mum and his sister.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.440

- No, no, no, no.

Yes, well, I am on duty,
so if you'll excuse me.

27:06.960 --> 27:10.320
Of course. I simply spied you loitering

- What are you writing?
- Everything you're saying.

Now, Officer, I am a respected solicitor
so there's no need to...

32:17.840 --> 32:19.200
Just stop writing, will you?

32:19.280 --> 32:24.280

why I might have exceeded the speed limit.

to travel at 48 in a 30 zone?

- To flout speed limits

- You hypnotised him.

- I have to water my Peace Lily.

- Yes, sir, of course.
- And there's a spare for Danny, too.

Absolute tosh, wasrt it?

Eve works in the local council, Sergeant.
Quite the lady in the know.

35:49.960 --> 35:52.800
- I am not.
- Nonsense.

Thank you very much for coming, George.
Excuse us.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.560
A pleasure, my liege.

36:08.640 --> 36:11.920
- Eve's nice, ain't she?
- She certainly has a distinctive laugh.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.280
She was in my year at school.
Always had a thing for her.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.920
She clearly has a thing for older men.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.200
What, with Martin Blower? No way!

36:21.680 --> 36:24.240
We just sat through three hours
of so-called acting, Constable,

36:24.320 --> 36:26.960
their kiss was
the only convincing moment in it.

36:27.040 --> 36:28.640
Hey, now you come to mention it,

I too have reason to believe
she favours the older gent.

- I've had my top off in this lay-by.
- Tits.

38:00.840 --> 38:07.120
Most likely lost control,
left the road there and then ended up here.

38:08.720 --> 38:12.880
So, what do we reckon?

38:13.640 --> 38:15.040
Sergeant Angel?

38:15.600 --> 38:18.320
Well, we should get a proper cordon off,
screen the remains from public view.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.040
Close down the road
until the ambulance crew arrives,

38:20.120 --> 38:23.320
whereupon we should open
a single lane of traffic and ease congestion.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.120
Very good.

38:25.760 --> 38:26.800
What he said.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.000
- What happened, Danny?
- Car accident.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.760
Nasty way to go.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.480
Constable, official vocab guidelines state

38:38.560 --> 38:41.520
we no longer refer to these incidents
as "accidents," they're now "collisions."

38:41.600 --> 38:42.640
Right.

"For never was there a story of more woe.
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

- Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.

Mr Skinner, do you mind telling me

38:54.080 --> 38:56.200
how you know the identity
of the persons involved?

38:56.280 --> 38:59.600
You know how it is. News travels fast.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.680
Hey, why can't we say "accident" again?

39:09.760 --> 39:12.120
Because "accident" implies
there's nobody to blame.

comes back with something,

39:25.640 --> 39:28.120
before you go jumping the Kalashnikov.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.200
All right, in the meantime, why don't you
check out a few of Martin Blower's clients?

39:31.280 --> 39:34.040
Martin Blower represents
damn near most of the village.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.600
Did you want us to go through
the whole phone book?

39:35.680 --> 39:38.360
Yeah, or put a call into Aaron A. Aaronson,
shall we?

39:38.440 --> 39:39.720
Please, don't be childish.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.040
At least consider interviewing the widow.

39:41.120 --> 39:43.120
Martin Blower was clearly having
an affair with Eve Draper.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.480
Oh, and how did you establish that?

39:46.560 --> 39:49.200
'Cause we sat through three hours
of so-called acting last night,

39:49.280 --> 39:51.600
and the kiss was
the only convincing moment in it.

39:51.680 --> 39:53.680
All right, pipe down, big one.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.200
Here, what else you got,
Crockett and Tubby?

39:56.280 --> 39:58.600
- Skid marks.
- Now who's being childish?

39:58.680 --> 40:00.440
There were no skid marks at the scene.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.360
Doesrt it seem a little strange that
Martin Blower would lose control of his car

40:03.440 --> 40:05.280
and not think to apply the brakes?

40:05.880 --> 40:07.120
If there were no skid marks it follows

40:07.200 --> 40:10.960
that for 300 yards both driver and passenger
did nothing to prevent their fate.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.960
You don't have to be a detective
to work that out!

40:13.040 --> 40:14.160
Yeah.

40:14.240 --> 40:17.200
- Are you causing trouble?
- Yes, they are.

40:17.280 --> 40:20.360
Well, a spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.

40:20.440 --> 40:23.800
Old Arthur Webley's been clipping
hedgerows that don't belong to him.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.520
- Yes, sir?
- That's it.

40:26.480 --> 40:27.560
Yes, sir.

40:33.280 --> 40:36.480
- Why do we need the dog?
- It's not the dog we need.

40:43.920 --> 40:44.960

40:45.040 --> 40:46.120

40:46.200 --> 40:48.200
(CHATTERING INCOHERENTLY)

40:51.760 --> 40:53.360
- What did he say?
- He said, "An 'edge is an 'edge.

40:53.440 --> 40:54.960
"He only chopped it down
'cause it spoilt his view.

40:55.040 --> 40:56.400
"What's Reaper moaning about?"

40:56.480 --> 40:57.520
Right.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.880
Look, I appreciate your position,
Mr Webley,

40:58.960 --> 41:02.000
but you can't go around chopping down
other people's hedges without permission.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.240
"Yes, I suppose."

41:05.320 --> 41:06.400
Thank you.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.560
All right.

41:10.160 --> 41:12.880
Mr Webley,
I trust you have a licence for that firearm?

41:15.160 --> 41:16.680
He does for this one.

41:18.360 --> 41:19.760
What do you mean by "this one"?

41:32.800 --> 41:35.360
By the power of Grey Skull.

41:35.440 --> 41:37.320
Where on earth did you get these?

41:37.400 --> 41:39.240
- Found them.
- He found them!

41:39.320 --> 41:42.760
- And what is this?
- Sea mine.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.320
Sea mine.

41:44.560 --> 41:47.000
Well, Mr Webley,
this is an extremely dangerous collection.

41:47.080 --> 41:48.520
It's a wonder nobody's been hurt before.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.520
No, it's just a lot of junk.

42:56.600 --> 42:59.880

we should do something to celebrate.

- I don't know. Pub?

MARY: Right you are, my love.

43:11.760 --> 43:13.760
Yes, sirs, what can I get you?

43:13.840 --> 43:15.360
Pint of lager, please, Roy.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.000
And what can I get you
that isn't a cranberry juice?

43:17.080 --> 43:19.600
- I don't really wanna get drunk.
- You can get a little drunk.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.280
- Okay, I'll have one.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.520
Mr Porter, what's your wine selection?

43:24.600 --> 43:29.040
Oh, we got red or white.

43:30.200 --> 43:33.240
- I'll have a pint of lager, please.
- Yeah, Roy.

43:38.080 --> 43:42.200
- Any news from earlier?
- Yeah. CSI found nothing.

43:42.280 --> 43:46.600
Doctor Hatcher reported no misadventure
and Mrs Blower has four alibis.

43:46.680 --> 43:52.400
Now, come on, Sergeant, it's not your job
to investigate this incident, is it?

43:53.160 --> 43:54.280
Is it?

43:54.360 --> 43:56.720
- No, it isn't.
- No, it isn't.

43:59.160 --> 44:02.280
- You don't switch off, do you?
- You sound like my ex.

44:02.880 --> 44:06.280
- Well, you are always thinking away.
- It's what I do.

44:06.360 --> 44:09.640
- Don't get me wrong. I think it's amazing.
- Really?

44:09.720 --> 44:12.240
I mean,
what made you wanna be a policeman?

44:12.320 --> 44:13.360
Officer.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.920
What made you wanna be
a policeman-officer?

44:18.360 --> 44:21.640
I don't remember a time
when I didn't wanna be a police officer.

44:21.720 --> 44:25.320
Apart from the summer of 1979
when I wanted to be Kermit the Frog.

44:26.280 --> 44:30.120
It all started with my Uncle Derek.
He was a Sergeant in the Met.

44:30.200 --> 44:33.000
He bought me a police pedal car
when I was five.

44:33.080 --> 44:35.120
I rode round in it every second I was awake.

44:35.200 --> 44:38.440
Arresting kids twice my size
for littering and spitting.

44:38.520 --> 44:41.480
I got beaten up a lot when I was young
but it didn't stop me.

44:41.560 --> 44:43.400
I wanted to be like Uncle Derek.

44:43.480 --> 44:44.520
He sounds like a good bloke.

44:44.600 --> 44:46.840
Actually, he was arrested
for selling drugs to students.

44:46.920 --> 44:48.000
What a cunt.

44:48.080 --> 44:50.400
Probably bought the pedal car
with the proceeds.

44:50.480 --> 44:53.640
Needless to say I never went near it again.
I just let it rust.

44:53.720 --> 44:55.680
But I never forgot
the clear sense of right and wrong

44:55.760 --> 44:57.680
that I felt at the wheel of that pedal car.

44:57.760 --> 45:00.280
I had to prove to myself
that the law could be proper

45:00.360 --> 45:02.640
and righteous
and for the good of humankind.

45:02.720 --> 45:06.200
It was from that moment,
I was destined to be a police officer.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.720
- Shame.
- How so?

45:08.800 --> 45:11.240
I think you would've made a great muppet.

45:14.720 --> 45:17.480
What about you? What made you
wanna become a police officer?

45:17.840 --> 45:20.840
I don't know. Dad does it.

45:20.920 --> 45:24.920
I think after my mum died, it's what
he wanted, you know, keep me close by.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.840
- Do you mind if I ask how she died?
- Traffic collision.

45:29.600 --> 45:30.920
I'm sorry.

45:32.040 --> 45:34.160
Never mind. Hey, watch this.

- You know George Merchant, don't you?
- Evening, Officer.

45:59.480 --> 46:02.280
Yes, we were just discussing the accident.

46:02.360 --> 46:05.640
I'd come to know Martin
and Eve very well of late.

46:05.720 --> 46:07.200
Such a loss.

46:07.280 --> 46:09.640
What say we drink to their demise?

46:09.720 --> 46:11.200
Shouldrt that be "drink to their memories"?

46:11.280 --> 46:13.440
Of course. Cheers.

46:13.520 --> 46:15.280
I must go to the little boys' room.

46:16.600 --> 46:19.240
- GEORGE: I'm all right!
- "Little" being the operative word.

46:19.800 --> 46:22.280
Oh, he'll be in bits tomorrow.

46:30.720 --> 46:33.280
I think somebody needs to go home.

46:33.360 --> 46:37.000
- I'm... I'm not that drunk, sir.
- Not you. Him.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.280
What?

46:41.480 --> 46:45.200
Hey, we did get a little drunk.
Did you get it?

46:45.280 --> 46:47.880
'Cause he's... He's little and he's drunk.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.480
Oh, good grief.

46:51.800 --> 46:54.640
It's hardly in keeping
with the village's rustic aesthetic, is it?

46:56.440 --> 46:58.840
- How much do I owe you?
- Twenty quid.

46:58.920 --> 47:00.840
There you go.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.440
- And there's your change.
- God bless you.

47:28.560 --> 47:32.160
Well, I shall see you in the morning.

47:32.240 --> 47:35.000
Unless you wanna come in
for a cup of coffee?

47:35.080 --> 47:37.640
- I don't drink coffee.
- Tea?

47:37.720 --> 47:39.680
No caffeine after midday.

47:40.400 --> 47:42.200
How about another beer?

47:49.600 --> 47:50.720
Oh, dear.

47:56.800 --> 48:00.000
- When did you move in?
- About five years ago.

48:01.160 --> 48:03.760
- You should get some house plants.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.560
Yeah. I've been tending my Peace Lily
for about three years now.

48:08.080 --> 48:11.480
It oxygenates the room,
helps you think, relieves stress.

48:11.560 --> 48:13.320
Its needs are simple.

48:17.440 --> 48:20.480
Janine used to say I love my Lily
more than I loved her.

- Is that why you split up?
- What?

48:23.600 --> 48:26.880
- 'Cause you did it with a plant?
- No, no, no.

48:26.960 --> 48:30.360
It was more about me being
obsessed with the job.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.880
That's good though, right?

48:33.360 --> 48:34.760
Is it though?

we let the fire crews finish their stuff,

to do a thorough sweep of the house.

to see Mr Merchant alive.

then who did?

53:24.000 --> 53:25.880

53:25.960 --> 53:28.480
Come on, boys.
Leave Sergeant Angel alone, he's working.

53:28.560 --> 53:31.880
Sorry, Chief,
won't waste any more police time.

53:31.960 --> 53:33.120
Have a nice time.

53:33.200 --> 53:35.520
Actually, Nicholas,
you might as well take a break.

53:35.600 --> 53:38.280
Hey, great. I've got something to show you.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.840
- This is a rifle range.
- You'll be really good at it.

53:46.920 --> 53:49.280
Feeling lucky, Sergeant?

53:50.080 --> 53:54.520
Three cans wins you the squeaky bunny,
five cans gets you the floppy lion.

53:54.600 --> 53:59.480
Take out all the little people,
you get to waltz off with the cuddly monkey.

54:00.560 --> 54:03.840
I thought I made it clear to you
how I feel about firearms.

54:03.920 --> 54:06.160
It's only an air rifle.

54:06.440 --> 54:07.560
Sergeant.

54:25.440 --> 54:27.080

- Thank you, Danny.
- I can't believe I shot someone.

54:37.560 --> 54:40.680
- He's a doctor, he can deal with it.
- I never shot anyone before.

54:40.760 --> 54:42.880
Danny, believe me,
it's not something you ever get used to.

54:42.960 --> 54:45.120
Yeah. Maybe we should
go on the bouncy castle.

<i>FRANK: Nicholas, what is it?</i>

57:11.560 --> 57:15.440
Sir, I think all these deaths are linked.
I think Tim Messenger was murdered.

57:15.840 --> 57:18.880
- Who could do something like this?
- Maybe it was the swan.

57:18.960 --> 57:21.920
- Apparently, they can break a mars arm.
- Or blow up a mars house.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.840
- Listen, you pair of...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nicholas.

57:25.320 --> 57:27.560

- Are you saying that this is a crime scene?
- Yes, sir, I am.

Very well.

- Detectives.

- Secure the area.

- PC Thatcher?
- Yes, love?

- Are you?
- Yes.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.640

we can figure out what links these deaths.

- George Merchant.
- Self-made millionaire.

Fancied himself as a property developer.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.840
- Said he had big plans for Sandford.
- Pissed on the floor in The Crown.

was a good friend and client of...

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.760
- Martin Blower.
- Respected solicitor.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.000
- Affirmatron.
- Leading light of the local drama society.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.440
- Bad actor.
- Undoubtedly.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.000
- Bad driver.
- Not necessarily.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.680
- Cheated on his missus.
- Most certainly.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.640
- And we both know who with.
- Eve Draper.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.440
- Blower's leading lady. Distinctive laugh.
- True.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.880
- Favoured older men.
- Fingered.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.160
- Worked at?
- Council.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.840
- More specifically?
- Department of Planning and Development.

Where George Merchant secured permission

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.840
to build his dubious mansion
on Norris Avenue.

Hello, Miss Tiller.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.680
I was wondering,
do you have any Japanese Peace Lilies?

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.120
Of course.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.200
I was just about to pop off, actually.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.200
I can never find my scissors.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.240
- Is this for someone special?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:26.000
- Are you going somewhere, Miss Tiller?
- Yes. I'm moving away.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.120
And why the move,
if you don't mind me asking?

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.840
- Well, just between you and I...
- Yes?

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.840
- You know that fella who blew up?
- George Merchant.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.960
Well, George Merchant, God rest him,
wanted to buy this land,

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.480
so he sends round his legal fella,
Martin Blower, God rest him,

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.600
and I thought I might take them up on it.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.240
I haven't really got that much family
round here, save for Cousin Sissy.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.640
So I thought I might take them up
on the offer and move to Buford Abbey.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.640
Would you like a card with this?

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.000
No, sorry, you were talking about the offer?

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.160
Well, it turns out that Martin Blower,
God rest him,

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.320
knew where the new bypass road is going

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.360
because he was knocking off Eve Draper
from the council, God rest her,

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:10.000
and then that reporter, God rest him,
finds out about the route

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.120
and tells me this land's very valuable.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.120
Ten times what George Merchant and
Martin Blower, God rest them, offered me.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.080
So, with them having passed on,
I decided to sell it on myself

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.840
to some folks from the city
that Martin, George and Eve,

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.880
God rest the lot of them,
had been talking to.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.680
Apparently, they want to build
a big shopping centre or something.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.440
Of course, Cousin Sissy won't be
too happy about that,

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.520
but as far as I'm concerned,
Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.120
Would you just excuse me,
for just one second?

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.880

- What, just like Tim Messenger?
- Yes!

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.920
- And George Merchant?
- Yes!

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.200
- And Eve Draper?
- Yes!

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.840
- And Martin Blower?
- No, actually.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.720
- Really?
- 'Course he fucking was!

Thank you, Andy.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.760
Come on, Sergeant, you've gotta accept
it was just another nasty accident.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:15.880
What are you suggesting?

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.360
That Leslie Tiller tripped
and fell on her own shears?

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.800
Ben Fletcher fell
on his pitchfork the other week.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:24.200
Yeah, accidents happen all the time.
What makes you think it was murder?

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.120
- Because I was there!
- There's a point.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.520
Why were you there?

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.680
I was buying Constable Butterman
a Japanese Peace Lily for his birthday.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.240
What absolute horseshit.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.120
I chased a suspect from the scene.
Innocent people don't run!

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.160
Here, maybe it was our old friend,
the cactus thief.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.840
Oh, yeah, he was a prickly customer,
werert he?

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.240
Am I going completely mad?

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.880
Maybe you are.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.360
Maybe you did it.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.640
Yeah, seeing as how you're such
a big fan of murder.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.080
- What the...
- Sergeant Angel?

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.560
Yes! Sir.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.800
- Sir, you have to understand...
- No, you have to understand.

The "M" word, Nicholas.

There hasn't been a recorded murder
in Sandford for 20 years.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.520
But, sir, I'm certain.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.120
And what's more, I know who did it.

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.760
Can I see the manager, please?

<i>Mr Skinner to the Manager's office.</i>
<i>Manager's office. Mr Skinner.</i>

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.760
Sergeant Angel.
And to what do I owe this pleasure?

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.760
Simon Skinner, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder of Leslie Tiller.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.160
Leslie Tiller's dead? How?

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.520
She tripped and fell on her own shears.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.680
(GROANS)

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.280
I'm also arresting you on suspicion of
the murder of Tim Messenger on May 1st,

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.920
of George Merchant on April 29th

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.480
and of Eve Draper
and Martin Blower on April 28th.

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:18.400
- Why on earth would I do that, Sergeant?
- I'm glad you asked.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.160
My suspicions were first aroused
when you appeared

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.920
<i>at the scene of the Blower-Draper death,</i>
<i>on the outskirts of Sandford,</i>

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.680
<i>despite the fact you live and work</i>
<i>in the centre of the village.</i>

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:34.000
I couldn't help but recall your comments
at the theatre on the previous evening.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:37.080
<i>When you not only indicated</i>
<i>an awareness of the couple's affair</i>

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.080
<i>but also inferred</i>
<i>that Eve's connections at the council</i>

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.000
<i>might make her privy</i>
<i>to important information.</i>

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.280
<i>You even spoke of "bashing her head in."</i>

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.840
Perhaps hoping you might discover
the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.080
<i>You were already suspicious</i>
<i>that George Merchant was buying up</i>

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.360
a large area of land
on the outskirts of Sandford,

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.280
after an article Tim Messenger
wrote in the <i>Sandford Citizen.</i>

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.880
You see, the land Merchant was buying
had little value in of itself but,

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.720
<i>if it became accessible by road,</i>
<i>it would be a prime location for say,</i>

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.680
a retail park.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.680
Consumed with concern for your business

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.720
and potential disloyalty
from fickle customers,

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.280
you yourself expressed a wish to behead.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.320
<i>You killed the competition in cold blood.</i>

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.240
<i>Staging the murders as accidents.</i>

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:19.279
<i>You used a vehicle removal truck</i>
<i>to stage the Blower-Draper death</i>

01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:21.200
<i>and incinerated an old man</i>
<i>in his own house.</i>

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:27.279
However, there was a loose end.

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:29.680
Tim Messenger.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.840
<i>Splattered before he could share with me</i>

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.760
<i>what he told Leslie Tiller</i>
<i>that very afternoon.</i>

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:37.560
<i>The true value of her land.</i>

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.720
Upon discovering she was about
to sell up to the developers,

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.520
you brutally murdered her
with her own shears.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:48.160
And made good your escape utilising
your impressive skills as a fun runner.

01:08:54.359 --> 01:08:58.000
Very entertaining. But I rather think
you've been watching too many films.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.439
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.560
He hasn't.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:04.240
Why would I kill Leslie?
You clearly aren't aware that we're related.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:06.800
Oh, but I am, "Cousin Sissy."

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:12.399
I'm afraid my nickname of Sissy
is only a revelation to yourself.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.920
My teenage years studying ballet
are well known.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.040
- Yeah, Sissy Skinner.
- What a Gaylord.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.600
Thank you, Andrews.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.920
Now, despite my comments
about "beheading" customers,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.399
I personally relish the competition
of another store.

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:30.960
Anything to energise my workforce.

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:36.840
And anyway, what makes you think
I could dislodge part of the church roof?

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.279
Or for that matter, stage a car crash?

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:42.600
It's a well known fact that
the church roof is in dire need of repair.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.760
And isn't it true
that two of your own employees

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.200
operate the vehicle removal service
for the council?

01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:49.560
Sergeant, this is the 21st Century.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.439
Many people hold down several jobs.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.080
I myself host a life drawing class
at the Village Hall.

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:59.080
Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.120
Nevertheless, you could have utilised
the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.160
These accusations
are quite meaningless, Sergeant,

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.760
unless you can back them up
with hard evidence.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.320
Well, you've got me there.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.320
I'd need something conclusive.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.480
Something that placed you
at the scene of the crime.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:18.440
Perhaps a wound you sustained on
a piece of broken glass this very evening.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.600
This very evening.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.960
Sergeant, this is beginning
to get embarrassing.

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.080
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.760
I'm sure the store's security footage
will absolve me.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.000
Do feel free to spool through.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.800
I can handle this, Danny.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.040
You might as well go back
and just enjoy the rest of your birthday.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.600
- Did you really get me that plant?
- Yes, I did.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:06.000
But it's been impounded as evidence.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.520
Well, I mean,
maybe Dad will still let me water it, eh?

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.720
Yeah.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.360
Sergeant, I wanted you to know that

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.640
if I do indeed now
own the land belonging to...

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.920
belonging to Leslie, that I intend to turn it
into a memorial garden, in her honour.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.400
Mr Skinner, what you do with your land
is of no concern of mine,

is an important feather in our cap.

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.600
<i>HATCHER: Couldrt let</i>
<i>Blower jeopardise that.</i>

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.840
Not when we had two semi-professionals
waiting in the wings.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.400
Let's not forget that Greg
was an extra in <i>Straw Dogs.</i>

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.280
And Sheree played a cadaver
in <i>Prime Suspect.</i>

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.720
Yes, I know!

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.320
Martin was less concerned
with the reputation of the village

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.480
than he was with his sordid affair
with Eve Draper.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.080
And so Eve deserved to die too?

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.480
Well, she did have a very annoying laugh.

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.760
ALL: Annoying.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:59.560
- And, and George Merchant?
- He had an awful house.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:00.880
ALL: Awful.

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.560
We begged him in vain
to make his residence

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.080
more in keeping
with the village's rustic aesthetic.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.600
And what about Tim Messenger?
What was his crime?

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:13.200
<i>Tim Messenger's tenure as editor of</i>
<i>the</i> Sandford Citizen <i>has been unbearable.</i>

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:16.960
Our once great paper had
become riddled with tabloid journalism.

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.920
<i>Not to mention persistent errors.</i>

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.120
- He listed her age as 55.
- When, actually, I'm 53.

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.640
Fifty-three.

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.320
What, what about Leslie Tiller?
One of your own?

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:27.800
Her horticultural expertise helped
put Sandford on the map.

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.840
Oh, she was ever so good.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:32.000
Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:35.840
But it seemed she was set on moving away.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:39.160
We couldn't have her sharing
her green fingers with anybody else.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.120
Not least those heathens at Buford Abbey.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.760
If we can't have her, no one can.

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.360
How can this be for the greater good?

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.400
- ALL: The greater good.
- Shut it!

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:50.520
These people died for no reason.
No reason whatsoever!

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.000
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:56.000
Hello, Nicholas.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.880
I was like you once.

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:02.760
I believed in the immutable word of the law.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.720
That is until the night Mrs Butterman
was taken from me.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.160
You see,
no one loved Sandford more than her.

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.080
She was head of the Womers Institute,
chair of the floral committee.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.160
When they started
the Village of the Year contest,

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:19.800
she worked round the clock.
I've never seen such dedication.

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:26.200
On the eve of the adjudicator's arrival,
some travellers moved into Callahan Park.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:30.360
Before you could say, "Gypsy scum,"
we were knee-deep in dog muck,

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.680
thieving kids and crusty jugglers.

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.440
ALL: Crusty jugglers.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.480
We lost the title and Irene lost her mind.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.400
She drove her Datsun Cherry
into Sandford Gorge.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:47.400
From that moment on,
I swore that I would do her proud.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:52.040
And whatever the cost,
we would make Sandford great again.

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.160
Sir, this doesn't make any sense.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:57.960
The adjudicators arrive tomorrow.
We had to get everything ready.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.640
Are you saying this is all about
winning the Best Village Award?

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:04.280
This is the best village, Nicholas.
You've seen the people.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.640
- They're happy, contented.
- They're living in a dream world.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:11.240
Sergeant Popwell
thought much the same as you.

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.280
I'm disappointed
you can't see the bigger picture.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.680
Well, I'm happy to disappoint you, sir.

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.440
And I'm afraid
you're gonna have to come with me.

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:19.520
You are all gonna have to come with me.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:23.520
No, Nicholas, I'm afraid it is you

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.240

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.840
and accidentally cut off his own head.

believe this man, are you?

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:32.480
Are you? He isn't even from round here.

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:40.320
Maybe it's time to give it up, sir.

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.400
You incompetent flatfoots!

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.720
Officer Walker, stay here with Saxon
and hold everything down.

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:56.880
Fair enough.

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:58.920
Officers, let's go.

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:02.120
- What about Dad?
- He'll come round again.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.160
Want anything from the shop?

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:14.960
(GUNS COCKING)

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:22.360
- What you thinking?
- Well...

01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.360
We should strike now,
while we've got the element of surprise.

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.160
Longer we wait,
more time they've got to mobilise.

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:28.920
I say we go in through the front entrance,
take the place aisle by aisle.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.800
They won't be expecting that.

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.000
Very good. What he said.

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.240
My, my. Here come the fuzz.

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:43.040
- Maybe they're not here.
- Wait here.

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.520
- Don't go in on your own.
- Don't worry, he knows what he's doing.

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:50.880
Okay. They're in.

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:53.960
You deal with the store.
I'll deal with the trolley boy.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.160
(BOTH EXCLAIM)

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:07.200
No, listen. Wait, wait, wait, Michael,
wait, listen to me. Listen, listen.

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.840
Is this what you really, really want?

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.200
Yarp.

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:12.720
Suit yourself.

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.680
FISHER: Go, go, go.

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:27.000
Oh, come on.

01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:38.720
(SCREAMS)

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.600
Andy!

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:46.080
It's all right, Andy. It's just Bolognese!

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:24.720
(GRUNTING)

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.920
- How's Lurch?
- He's in the freezer.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.320
- Did you say, "Cool off"?
- No, I didn't say anything, actually.

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:50.040
Shame.

01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:51.480
There was a bit earlier on that you missed

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.080
when I distracted him
with the cuddly monkey.

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.840
And then I said, "Playtime's over,"
and I hit him with the Peace Lily.

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.920
You're off the fucking chain!

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.360
- What's the situation?
- Two blokes and a fuckload of cutlery.

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.800
What do you reckon?

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.160
Idea.

(ALL YELLING)

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.320
Good work, everyone.

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:43.520
- Nice one, Doris.
- Nothing like a bit of girl on girl.

01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:48.080
Fruit attack!

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.560
Can you handle this, Sergeant Fisher?
We're gonna go after the big boss.

01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:53.480
We're on it, Sergeant.

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.680
- Danny, let's rock.
- Angel!

01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.440
Don't go being a twat now.

01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:59.880
I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.320
- We should get down there.
- How?

01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:10.720
Skip.

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:19.360
- Head them off?
- Fuck, yeah.

01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:33.680
- I'll drive.
- Shotgun! Punch that shit!

Get out of my village!

01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:05.160
It's not your village anymore.

01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.080
- You did good, kid.
- Ta.

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:25.320
- What's your name?
- Aaron A. Aaronson.

01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:27.120
Sorry?

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:35.360
Angel!

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.800
It's over, Danny.

It's over.

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:05.000
This really hurts.

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:10.280
I'm going to need some ice-cream.

01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:13.400
Yeah, well, don't worry.
There's plenty of ice-cream at the station.

01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:14.600
Isn't that right, Danny?

01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:15.720

- Pack it in, Frank, you silly bastard!
- Now, now.

01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:22.280
We don't want any more bloodshed.

01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:25.000
Frank, this whole thing started
because you lost somebody you loved.

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:26.920
Don't expect me to believe
you'd let it end the same way.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.440
I'll tell you how this is gonna end!

You don't have to say anything at all.

CHIEF INSPECTOR:
What do you say, Nicholas?

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.400
We... We...
We have been trying to reach you for days.

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:45.520
- Yeah, well, I've been kind of busy.
- SERGEANT: We need you back.

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:49.280
The figures have gone a little squiffy
in your absence, it has to be said.

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:50.440
Come back to London.

01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:53.640
Sandford's hardly a fitting place
for such an exceptional officer.

01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:56.320
Yeah, well, the thing is, sir.

01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:58.920
I kind of like it here.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.240
Besides, we have to do
a considerable amount of paperwork.

(INAUDIBLE)

01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:32.400
- Fuck's sake, Nick, this is gonna take ages.
- Yeah, it's gonna take all night.

FISHER: Well, good job
we've got the manpower, Andy?

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.800
Well, official vocab guidelines state
that we say "staffing," not "manpower,"

01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:40.440
'cause "manpower's" a bit sexist.

Oh, dirty bastard!
