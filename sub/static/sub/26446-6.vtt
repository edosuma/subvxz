00:00.937 --> 00:03.782
Rel is taped in front of
a live studio audience.

00:03.783 --> 00:06.017
What's up, y'all?
Nat's got some great news.

00:06.018 --> 00:07.452
All right, Rel, Pop,

00:07.453 --> 00:09.287
you know I been looking
for a job ever since

00:09.288 --> 00:10.622
I got out of jail, right? Okay.

00:10.623 --> 00:13.591
So Dollar Store said no. Okay?

00:13.592 --> 00:15.460
Then the second Dollar Store said no.

00:15.461 --> 00:17.128
Okay?

00:17.129 --> 00:18.530
And then I didn't realized

00:18.531 --> 00:20.231
that you have to have your own
car to drive Uber, but..

00:20.232 --> 00:22.467
I didn't give up.

00:22.468 --> 00:24.608
I hope, somewhere in this story,
that you got a job.

00:25.738 --> 00:28.439
Pop, I got a job, baby.

00:29.375 --> 00:30.808
Congratulations, man.

00:33.746 --> 00:35.480
Where you working at, man?

00:35.481 --> 00:38.082
Y'all are looking at
the new administrative assistant

00:38.083 --> 00:40.485
for the office of
Alderman Willie Littles.

00:40.486 --> 00:42.086
What?

00:42.087 --> 00:44.522
Come on, man, that's a great job.

00:44.523 --> 00:47.759
Guess it's a good thing those
Dollar Stores turned you down.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.327
- I'm proud of you, son.
- Oh, thank you, Pop.

00:49.328 --> 00:51.710
Um, thanks to Brittany,
though, you know.

00:51.711 --> 00:52.857
For hooking the whole thing up.

00:52.858 --> 00:55.093
Well, actually,
my homegirl Tia hooked it up.

00:55.094 --> 00:56.398
See, she owed me a favor

00:56.399 --> 00:58.200
for helping her out
with her Halloween costume.

00:58.201 --> 01:00.068
She went as Rachel Dolezal.

01:00.069 --> 01:01.269
Ooh.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.404
The black white lady?

01:03.439 --> 01:05.507
That's a hard costume.

01:05.507 --> 01:06.875
Wait, wait, wait.

01:06.876 --> 01:08.477
You talkin' about fine-ass Tia, right?

01:08.478 --> 01:10.312
- Yep.
- You know what's crazy?

01:10.313 --> 01:12.013
I saw her in a grocery store
a few days ago

01:12.014 --> 01:13.715
and I was gonna go speak to her then.

01:13.716 --> 01:15.050
I was moving my cart too fast,

01:15.051 --> 01:17.953
and I ran into the sample lady and...

01:17.954 --> 01:19.955
All the ham was spilled
all over my body,

01:19.956 --> 01:20.956
it was just kind of weird.

01:20.957 --> 01:22.624
So, uh...

01:22.625 --> 01:24.726
would you mind
still hooking that up? Huh?

01:24.727 --> 01:26.094
She only dates powerful men.

01:26.095 --> 01:27.762
Wait a minute.

01:27.763 --> 01:29.331
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm powerful.

01:29.332 --> 01:30.532
I'm a nurse. Huh?

01:30.533 --> 01:31.900
You know how powerful you gotta be

01:31.901 --> 01:33.735
to pronounce somebody dead?

01:33.736 --> 01:36.171
Look, Rel, forget about Tia.

01:36.172 --> 01:37.706
I'm not letting you nowhere near her.

01:37.707 --> 01:39.207
Besides, if I got any chance

01:39.208 --> 01:41.209
of getting my own
clothing store someday,

01:41.210 --> 01:42.677
I'm-a need friends
in the alderman's office.

01:42.678 --> 01:44.446
They control everything
in this community.

01:44.447 --> 01:45.747
She's right.

01:45.748 --> 01:47.616
That's politics in the Windy City.

01:47.617 --> 01:51.720
Or, as I call it, Windy City Politics.

01:51.721 --> 01:53.188
You know where they got
that name don't you?

01:53.189 --> 01:56.057
Yes, Dad.

01:56.058 --> 01:59.094
Look, everybody thinks
it came from the wind.

01:59.095 --> 02:01.663
But it came from politicians
sitting in a room, talking.

02:01.664 --> 02:03.431
All that hot air, moving around.

02:03.432 --> 02:05.901
Wind. Wind, going around.

02:05.902 --> 02:07.235
Political wind.

02:07.236 --> 02:11.306
Windy City Politics.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074

02:21.217 --> 02:22.551
Oh, man.

02:22.552 --> 02:24.886
The office of Alderman Willie Littles.

02:24.887 --> 02:26.254
You know, somebody smashed
this same window

02:26.255 --> 02:27.789
when the Cubs won the World Series?

02:29.559 --> 02:31.726
History.

02:32.728 --> 02:35.096
What do you mean, history, okay?

02:35.097 --> 02:37.299
- History, schmistory. Where's Tia at?
- What, you...

02:37.300 --> 02:39.401
you're here for Tia?
I thought you was here for me

02:39.402 --> 02:41.069
to walk your brother
to his first day of work.

02:41.070 --> 02:43.738
You a grown-ass man. This ain't
the first day of school.

02:43.739 --> 02:45.674
Nat.

02:45.675 --> 02:48.276
- Welcome.
- Thank you, ma'am.

02:48.277 --> 02:50.445
I appreciate the opportunity.
Anything I can do

02:50.446 --> 02:52.347
to improve the community, I will.

02:52.348 --> 02:53.982
- Great.
- And, uh,

02:53.983 --> 02:55.650
I'm his, uh...

02:55.651 --> 02:58.954
I'm his big brother, Rel.
You know what I mean?

02:58.955 --> 03:00.359
I'm, uh, Brittany's
best friend, you know?

03:00.360 --> 03:01.098
Mm-hmm

03:01.099 --> 03:02.390
You remember me, right?

03:02.391 --> 03:05.627
Yeah, didn't I see you
at the grocery store?

03:07.597 --> 03:09.798
Nah, that wasn't me,
you know what I mean?

03:09.799 --> 03:12.601
I mean, I look like a lot
of dudes with glasses, you know.

03:12.602 --> 03:14.803
People say I look like T-Pain
all the time.

03:14.804 --> 03:17.339
Uh, hey.

03:17.340 --> 03:20.141
Nadine, can you help Nat
with his paperwork?

03:20.142 --> 03:23.611
Okay. Take care, Rel.

03:28.851 --> 03:30.852
Hey.

03:30.853 --> 03:32.087
- What's up?
- Look,

03:32.088 --> 03:33.355
first of all, honestly, I just...

03:33.356 --> 03:35.423
I just want to thank you

03:35.424 --> 03:36.691
for, uh, looking out
for my brother, Nat.

03:36.692 --> 03:38.293
You know, this is a good job for him.

03:38.294 --> 03:40.061
That's why I'm about to go
to work at the hospital.

03:40.062 --> 03:42.230
You know, I'm a nurse. I save lives.

03:42.231 --> 03:44.666
That's great. The medical profession

03:44.667 --> 03:46.501
is one of the pillars
of our community.

03:46.502 --> 03:48.536
That's me.

03:48.537 --> 03:51.640
You know, I'm a cool cat,
and I'm a pillar, you know,

03:51.641 --> 03:53.742
which makes me a caterpillar.

03:53.743 --> 03:55.377
You get it? Caterpillar?

03:55.378 --> 03:57.045
- You put it together.
- Yeah.

03:57.046 --> 03:58.680
Pardon me, Caterpillar.

03:58.681 --> 04:00.515
Hey, Tia. Here's the shirt you bought.

04:00.516 --> 04:02.350
Hey, Brittany. Thank you so much

04:02.351 --> 04:03.939
for bringing this. I
can't wait to wear it.

04:03.940 --> 04:05.620
No problem.
Listen, I know you're real busy,

04:05.621 --> 04:07.088
so me and Rel can get out your way.

04:07.089 --> 04:09.858
But listen, if any retail spaces
become available, you let...

04:09.859 --> 04:11.519
Absolutely. You know
I'm-a let you know.

04:11.557 --> 04:13.728
- All right, cool. Thank you, girl. Okay.
- Okay, take care. Rel, it was nice

04:13.729 --> 04:15.363
to see you.

04:15.364 --> 04:17.565
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

04:17.565 --> 04:20.135
What'd you do that for? I was
about to seal the deal with her.

04:20.136 --> 04:23.638
Rel, you called yourself
a caterpillar.

04:24.907 --> 04:26.975
Yeah, you right.

04:28.511 --> 04:30.178
Hey, Nat.

04:30.179 --> 04:32.347
I want to introduce you
to Alderman Littles.

04:32.348 --> 04:35.383
Alderman, this is Nat,

04:35.384 --> 04:36.751
our new administrative assistant.

04:36.752 --> 04:38.853
Of course.

04:38.854 --> 04:41.589
He's a part of that, uh, Ex-Con
Ex-cel Program we're starting.

04:41.590 --> 04:44.759
Let me tell you this, young man.
Just because you sold drugs

04:44.760 --> 04:47.228
doesn't necessarily mean
that you are a thug.

04:47.229 --> 04:50.865
Understand that achieving
is believing.

04:50.866 --> 04:55.303
Okay? We have to rectify
and correctify this community.

04:55.304 --> 04:57.305
And that is why I'm so happy

04:57.306 --> 05:00.308
- to put you back to work, son.
- Wow, thank you, seriously.

05:00.309 --> 05:01.509
Because let me
tell you something, son.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.511
There's no shortcut to success.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.747
Okay, you got to put
your best foot forward.

05:05.748 --> 05:07.649
You got to, uh, be focused, okay?

05:07.650 --> 05:09.250
It can't be about the hocus pocus.

05:09.251 --> 05:11.319
You know what I mean?
If you get put to the test,

05:11.320 --> 05:13.521
you got to bring your best.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.023
You get me?

05:15.024 --> 05:16.624
Well, I'm-a leave you with this.

05:16.625 --> 05:19.194
God bless you,

05:19.195 --> 05:21.696
God bless the West Side of Chicago

05:21.697 --> 05:25.200
and God bless the 28th Ward.

05:30.206 --> 05:33.375
Wow.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.643
- That Alderman Littles is some man.
- He is.

05:35.644 --> 05:38.313
Nat, I'm really happy
to have you here.

05:38.314 --> 05:39.614
Oh, thank you.

05:39.615 --> 05:42.417
It's, um... it's nice to have someone

05:42.418 --> 05:47.088
so young and fit in the office.

05:55.431 --> 05:57.599
Hey, Nat.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.604
You've been busy all week.
What's this?

06:00.605 --> 06:02.267
Oh, I was just designing
a couple posters

06:02.268 --> 06:03.538
for Alderman's next campaign.

06:03.539 --> 06:04.773
Actually, right here,

06:04.774 --> 06:06.541
this is my personal favorite.

06:06.542 --> 06:09.377
Oh.

06:09.378 --> 06:10.979
It's really great work.

06:10.980 --> 06:12.213
Thank you.

06:12.214 --> 06:15.650
Really... great.

06:23.459 --> 06:25.560
Thank you.

06:28.464 --> 06:30.865
There he is.

06:30.866 --> 06:33.835
Mr. Nine-to-five. Mr. Working Man.

06:33.836 --> 06:37.071
Mr. I Don't Need EBT Anymore.

06:38.974 --> 06:40.942
I'm actually glad you're here.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.811
I need to talk with you about Tia.

06:42.812 --> 06:44.479
I knew it.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.381
She's into me, ain't she?

06:46.382 --> 06:48.349
Yeah, Brittany doesn't know anything.

06:48.350 --> 06:49.784
Always hooking me up
with her disgusting friends.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.786
Never the good ones.

06:51.787 --> 06:54.189
No, bro, it's not that. Look...

06:54.190 --> 06:56.191
I think Tia's hitting on me.

06:56.192 --> 06:58.226
What?

06:58.227 --> 06:59.828
Nah, man, get out of here.

06:59.829 --> 07:01.529
Earlier she said
I did a good job on something,

07:01.530 --> 07:03.431
right, and then she smacked my ass.

07:03.432 --> 07:05.600
Come on, bruh.
That doesn't make any sense.

07:05.601 --> 07:07.335
Okay? She seemed really into me.

07:07.336 --> 07:10.138
What? When did she ever seem into you?

07:10.139 --> 07:14.943
Brother, she called me a pillar
of this community. Come on.

07:14.944 --> 07:18.046
Man, she calls everybody that
who walks in here.

07:18.047 --> 07:21.449
Yesterday she called
Pretty Paul that, and he a pimp.

07:21.450 --> 07:24.219
Okay, look,
that doesn't mean anything.

07:24.220 --> 07:25.520
Okay? Me and her had a connection.

07:25.521 --> 07:27.188
Did you or her have a connection?

07:27.189 --> 07:28.957
No, no connection at all.
Look, I'm just trying

07:28.958 --> 07:30.925
to do my work and stay out of trouble.

07:31.165 --> 07:33.426
There's absolutely no
connection, what so ever.

07:33.896 --> 07:35.812
Oh, hey, Rel

07:36.365 --> 07:39.100
Oh, hey, Tia.

07:39.101 --> 07:40.668
I see what it is.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.437
See, because me and you are brothers

07:42.438 --> 07:44.239
and you here every day,

07:44.240 --> 07:48.510
she has transferred the vibe
me and her have to you, right?

07:48.511 --> 07:49.777
What I have to do

07:49.778 --> 07:52.514
is transfer that vibe back to me.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.849
Okay. So, how we gonna do that?

07:54.850 --> 07:58.553
Simple, brother. I'm-a ask her out.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.456
Uh, hey, Tia.

08:01.457 --> 08:04.659
Hey, Rel. You came to have lunch
with your brother?

08:04.660 --> 08:07.028
No, you know,
not necessarily, you know.

08:07.029 --> 08:09.597
I was down the street, man,
'cause, you know, there was a...

08:09.598 --> 08:11.432
there was a pregnant lady
stuck in a tree.

08:11.433 --> 08:14.168
You know,
and I had to climb up the tree

08:14.169 --> 08:17.272
'cause I'm a athletic nurse,
you know what I mean?

08:17.273 --> 08:19.908
Had to get her down,
and then she went into birth,

08:19.909 --> 08:21.209
and then I had to, like,
deliver the baby,

08:21.210 --> 08:22.510
so I need to wash my hands now.

08:22.511 --> 08:24.679
That's what...

08:24.680 --> 08:28.550
Wow. Well, the West Side of Chicago

08:28.551 --> 08:31.352
owes you a great debt of gratitude.

08:31.353 --> 08:34.289
You know something,
it's not all about that.

08:34.289 --> 08:36.991
Just seeing that newborn baby's smile

08:36.991 --> 08:38.926
is enough for me, you know.

08:40.563 --> 08:43.164
So, uh...

08:43.164 --> 08:46.301
I was wondering if, uh, you know...

08:46.302 --> 08:47.835
you know, if you ain't busy,

08:47.836 --> 08:49.404
you know, maybe I could
take you out to dinner

08:49.405 --> 08:53.007
or, you know, go see a movie,
get some drinks.

08:53.008 --> 08:55.209
No, thanks. I'm not interested in you.

08:58.447 --> 09:01.416
Wow. I mean,

09:01.417 --> 09:04.786
you could've gave me a soft no and...

09:04.787 --> 09:07.589
then I ask again, and you
give me firm no and then...

09:07.590 --> 09:10.558
Look, I don't mind being strung along.

09:10.559 --> 09:13.294
Look, Rel, politics
is all about communication,

09:13.295 --> 09:17.098
and I find direct communication
to be the most effective.

09:19.068 --> 09:20.835
Man.

09:20.836 --> 09:23.838
Windy City Politics.

09:26.241 --> 09:29.077
So, did you transfer the vibe?

09:29.078 --> 09:31.145
No. I tried it. Didn't work.

09:31.146 --> 09:32.714
Shouldn't have come. Going to work.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.290
Hey, Nat.

09:42.291 --> 09:43.958
Come have a drink with me.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.227
No, thank you. I was actually
just... just locking up.

09:46.228 --> 09:47.729
I'm heading home right now, actually.

09:47.730 --> 09:49.464
Oh, come on,
you're not gonna make your boss

09:49.465 --> 09:52.433
drink by herself, are you?

10:02.378 --> 10:06.114
Cheers.

10:08.584 --> 10:12.353
- Okay, thanks.
- Nat, wait! Wait.

10:12.354 --> 10:16.691
Ooh, you need to loosen up...

10:16.692 --> 10:19.260
and smile more.

10:19.261 --> 10:21.162
I'm working on that.

10:23.975 --> 10:25.075
_ _

10:29.104 --> 10:31.005
Hey, Nat. What's the damn problem?

10:31.006 --> 10:33.707
I had my socks off.

10:33.708 --> 10:35.242
And you know me:
when my socks are off,

10:35.243 --> 10:36.744
I don't like to leave the house again.

10:36.745 --> 10:38.278
Look, Dad,

10:38.279 --> 10:40.280
today at work, my boss Tia...

10:40.281 --> 10:42.282
she grabbed my junk.

10:42.283 --> 10:44.918
I think I'm being sexually harassed.

10:44.919 --> 10:47.387
Is Tia a man?

10:49.090 --> 10:50.758
Is Tia ugly?

10:50.759 --> 10:52.493
Oh, I can answer that.

10:52.494 --> 10:54.895
She-she's, uh, she's very attractive,

10:54.896 --> 10:56.563
but, um, she's one
of the meanest people

10:56.564 --> 10:58.666
I've ever met in my life.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.934
Then you are not being
sexually harassed.

11:00.935 --> 11:03.037
You're only sexually harassed

11:03.038 --> 11:06.273
when a woman's not attractive.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.708
Let me give you an example.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.443
If I was working for Pam Grier

11:09.444 --> 11:12.346
and she hit on me,
wanted to give me sex, bam!

11:12.347 --> 11:13.547
I got to take that.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.416
Next thing you know,

11:15.417 --> 11:18.185
I've lost my job. Now I'm down
here working at the post office

11:18.186 --> 11:20.687
bragging to other mailmen,
"You know I hit Pam Grier, man."

11:22.457 --> 11:24.291
It's not even about
how she looks, man.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.893
I'm uncomfortable, Pop.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.929
Like, I just want to go to work,
do a good job.

11:28.930 --> 11:30.564
I don't know what to do.

11:30.565 --> 11:34.468
Okay, look here, little bruh.
I'm a male nurse.

11:34.469 --> 11:37.604
I get sexually harassed
all the time, all right?

11:37.605 --> 11:39.907
But do you think I'm gonna
report 80-year-old Doris

11:39.908 --> 11:41.508
that's going through stage four cancer

11:41.509 --> 11:43.477
'cause she caressed my thigh? No.

11:43.478 --> 11:45.212
Okay?

11:46.815 --> 11:49.075
I'm-a grab a fruit cup,
and I'm-a stare out the window.

11:52.353 --> 11:56.623
Do you know how hard it is for a
ex-con to get a job these days?

11:57.201 --> 12:00.661
And they put us all in the same damn
box, man. Murderers, gangsters.

12:00.662 --> 12:02.730
All I did was sell ecstasy
to rich, white kids

12:02.731 --> 12:05.833
and now their parents won't hire me.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.668
I don't know what to do, man.

12:07.669 --> 12:09.570
I'm-a be honest with you, right?

12:09.571 --> 12:11.238
You are a ex-con

12:11.239 --> 12:13.907
and she's a very successful
and beautiful woman.

12:13.908 --> 12:15.642
Ain't nobody gonna believe you.

12:15.643 --> 12:18.178
I'm just being straight up, bro,
like, for real,

12:18.179 --> 12:20.481
I know I know you,
but if I heard this story,

12:20.482 --> 12:22.015
I wouldn't believe you either..

12:22.016 --> 12:23.851
Look, Nat,

12:23.852 --> 12:26.820
this job is a big opportunity for you.

12:26.821 --> 12:29.790
If you could stick it out,
maybe you should.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.292
I'm trying to stick it out, bro.
It's tough.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.827
Getting this job,

12:33.828 --> 12:35.896
I thought I would finally
get some type of control

12:35.897 --> 12:40.634
over my life, and now I just...
I feel... I feel powerless.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.402
What would you do?

12:42.403 --> 12:44.938
I already told you what I'd do.
Pam Grier, I'm in.

12:46.407 --> 12:48.876
But if it makes you feel
uncomfortable,

12:48.877 --> 12:52.579
I don't think any situation is
worth sacrificing your dignity.

12:52.580 --> 12:54.481
So if you want to quit,
I understand it.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.151
I'm-a support you as long
as you need it, but if I hear

12:57.152 --> 12:59.386
a year from now that you regret

12:59.387 --> 13:02.623
not hitting that,
I'll kick you out my house.

13:02.624 --> 13:04.458
Look, man, look, don't worry about it.

13:04.459 --> 13:06.326
M-Maybe you should talk
to Brittany about it, okay?

13:06.327 --> 13:07.561
Her and Tia are really good friends.

13:07.562 --> 13:08.796
She could probably help you.

13:08.797 --> 13:10.564
No, listen, that's just
gonna make everything

13:10.565 --> 13:11.732
way more complicated.

13:11.733 --> 13:13.200
Do not say nothing to Brittany.

13:13.201 --> 13:14.368
I got you.

13:14.369 --> 13:15.903
Hey, what's up?

13:16.438 --> 13:19.023
Hey, what do you know
about this Tia woman?

13:19.641 --> 13:22.242
Wow, Rel.

13:22.243 --> 13:24.311
Tia rejects you, and so
you gonna have your dad

13:24.312 --> 13:25.512
pump me for information?

13:25.513 --> 13:27.181
- What?
- Here's the information:

13:27.182 --> 13:29.183
she don't like you. Okay?

13:29.184 --> 13:30.984
She's way too powerful,

13:30.985 --> 13:33.587
she's too accomplished,
and she's very well-connected.

13:33.588 --> 13:36.690
And if you try to come at her
again, she gonna crush you.

13:36.691 --> 13:39.927
So, Nat, how's the job going?

13:39.928 --> 13:43.397
Well... Tia says I'm doing good.

13:46.100 --> 13:48.902
Uh, hey, Tia, can I talk to you
for a second?

13:48.903 --> 13:50.570
Sure, come in, close the door.

13:54.409 --> 13:57.277
Hey, Tia, so, um,

13:57.278 --> 13:59.079
look, I really need this job,

13:59.080 --> 14:00.881
but I-I'm uncomfortable with you
touching me all the time,

14:00.882 --> 14:02.716
so I would like for you to stop it.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.484
No.

14:04.485 --> 14:07.654
Damn, that was direct.

14:07.655 --> 14:08.722
Mm-hmm.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.258
Well, I guess I have no choice.

14:11.259 --> 14:14.428
If the only way to make you stop
is to give you what you want,

14:14.429 --> 14:16.330
then... let's have sex then.

14:18.967 --> 14:21.635
Tia, I had a couple...

14:21.636 --> 14:23.704
Young Nat, why is your nipples out?

14:27.766 --> 14:28.866
_ _

14:30.584 --> 14:31.910
What is going on in here Tia?

14:31.911 --> 14:34.371
He just walked in here and said
he wanted to have sex with me.

14:34.372 --> 14:36.821
No, no, no, no, no.
She was sexually harassing me

14:36.822 --> 14:38.356
and I was just giving in.

14:38.357 --> 14:42.922
Okay, it seems as if we have
a bit of a situation here.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.592
Come here, Nat, take a walk with me.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.694
I promise you, Mr. Alderman,
I'm telling you the truth.

14:47.695 --> 14:50.463
Look, see, son,
in this particular situation

14:50.464 --> 14:52.098
we are partaking in,

14:52.099 --> 14:55.034
in this era of sexual
re-districtification,

14:55.035 --> 14:57.103
I cannot possibly believe you.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.938
Now what you have done is,

14:58.939 --> 15:00.540
you've put Alderman Willie Littles

15:00.541 --> 15:02.275
in a sticky situation,

15:02.276 --> 15:05.044
and it's two things that
Alderman Littles don't do:

15:05.045 --> 15:07.714
is sticky and situations. Okay?

15:07.715 --> 15:09.882
Now I could appreciate
the difficult position

15:09.883 --> 15:11.584
you have put yourself in,

15:11.585 --> 15:13.886
and I don't want to see you
get into any trouble.

15:13.887 --> 15:15.588
I definitely don't want any trouble.

15:15.589 --> 15:17.790
And, right, that's my top concern.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.626
I believe in second chances.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.795
I've had a second, a third,
and a fourth chance.

15:22.796 --> 15:25.331
I have so many illegitimate children,

15:25.332 --> 15:27.533
not in Chicago,
but they are everywhere.

15:27.534 --> 15:28.935
Look here.

15:28.936 --> 15:31.971
I just want to give you
a second chance

15:31.972 --> 15:33.673
on your second chance.

15:33.674 --> 15:36.342
I really appreciate that,
Mr. Alderman. Thank you so much.

15:36.343 --> 15:40.046
- No problem.
- Wait, did you just fire me?

15:40.047 --> 15:43.283
It appears that way.

15:43.284 --> 15:45.318
You got fired,

15:45.319 --> 15:47.987
but you saying Tia
sexually harassed you?

15:47.988 --> 15:50.356
Yes. She been harassing me
and touching me

15:50.357 --> 15:51.691
the whole entire week, Britt.

15:51.692 --> 15:53.760
Nat, are you sure?

15:53.761 --> 15:55.762
You know you got a habit
of misjudging people.

15:55.763 --> 15:57.397
Remember you thought
the lady down the block

15:57.398 --> 15:58.831
was kidnapping kids

15:58.832 --> 16:01.768
when she just ran
a licensed orphanage?

16:02.970 --> 16:04.937
Okay, Brittany, relax, okay?

16:04.938 --> 16:06.372
He's not lying, all right?

16:06.373 --> 16:08.808
Tia's not who we thought she was.

16:08.809 --> 16:11.477
She's just another one
of your disgusting friends.

16:13.847 --> 16:17.850
- Nat, are you sure about this?
- Yeah, Britt.

16:17.851 --> 16:21.020
Damn. I'm going down there.

16:21.021 --> 16:24.724
- Yo, Britt. Britt, wait.
- I'm going, Nat.

16:28.762 --> 16:30.363
I can't do nothing right, bro.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.765
Hey, hey, hey, hey, man.
Just-just relax, bro.

16:32.766 --> 16:34.267
- I didn't even last a week.
- It's not your fault.

16:34.268 --> 16:35.435
Look, it's not your fault.

16:35.436 --> 16:37.203
Everything is my fault, bro.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.505
Okay, I'm tired of letting
you down, man.

16:39.506 --> 16:41.574
I'm tired of disappointing Dad.

16:41.575 --> 16:44.077
What's the point of me building
my life back up if I'm...

16:44.078 --> 16:46.746
I'm just gonna mess it up anyway?

16:46.747 --> 16:49.449
To be honest with you,
you ain't letting me down.

16:49.450 --> 16:51.751
I feel like I let you down.

16:51.752 --> 16:53.686
What do you mean, you let me down?

16:53.687 --> 16:56.789
Look, little brah.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.894
I remember when Mom, uh,
she brought you home

17:01.895 --> 17:03.229
from the hospital, right?

17:03.230 --> 17:05.665
You was a baby
in your little bassinet,

17:05.665 --> 17:07.934
and I was just staring
and looking at you,

17:07.935 --> 17:10.703
and just... I grabbed
your little hand,

17:10.704 --> 17:12.003
and, you know, in that moment
I let you know

17:12.005 --> 17:13.705
that I'd always protect you,

17:13.707 --> 17:16.642
but when you needed me,
I didn't do that.

17:19.012 --> 17:21.180
You got to understand something, bro,

17:21.181 --> 17:24.916
when you went to jail, you know...

17:24.917 --> 17:27.119
I pretty much blame myself for that.

17:27.121 --> 17:28.588
Nat, you're one of my best friends,

17:28.589 --> 17:30.123
you're not just my little brother.

17:30.124 --> 17:32.291
And I felt bad, you know, dealing

17:32.292 --> 17:33.893
with all the stuff I had
going on in my life,

17:33.894 --> 17:36.429
and just focused on me,

17:36.430 --> 17:39.799
and I forgot that my little
brother actually needed me.

17:39.800 --> 17:43.836
Look, man, I mean, I got to be
responsible for my own mistakes.

17:43.837 --> 17:45.438
But I need you to know something,

17:45.439 --> 17:46.939
you've always been
a great brother to me.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.908
And to be honest, I...

17:48.909 --> 17:52.478
I always wanted to be like you.

17:52.479 --> 17:54.180
You know, had a job,

17:54.181 --> 17:58.751
a wife, a family.

17:58.752 --> 18:01.587
I mean, I want it to turn
out better, of course, but...

18:03.490 --> 18:06.058
Believe me, I did, too.

18:06.059 --> 18:08.060
But you know something, Nat?
That's life, brah.

18:08.061 --> 18:09.395
I'm gonna tell you this now.

18:09.396 --> 18:10.830
You're gonna do so much more than me,

18:10.831 --> 18:12.098
it's gonna be crazy.

18:12.099 --> 18:14.667
I believe in you.

18:14.668 --> 18:16.502
And I'm gonna be there with you
every step of the way

18:16.503 --> 18:18.971
to make sure you accomplish
all the goals you want to do.

18:18.972 --> 18:21.073
I'm proud of you, man.

18:21.074 --> 18:23.176
I love you, bruh, come here.

18:23.177 --> 18:26.379
- Love yo too, man.
- Huh.

18:28.782 --> 18:32.618
Also, uh...

18:32.619 --> 18:34.153
I'm sorry, uh,

18:34.154 --> 18:35.822
tried to holler at the woman

18:35.823 --> 18:37.490
who'd been sexually harassing you.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.792
Man, it's okay.

18:39.793 --> 18:41.360
I mean, you gotta take your shots

18:41.361 --> 18:43.563
where you can take
your shots. I mean...

18:43.564 --> 18:47.567
We need to talk
and you need to be honest.

18:47.568 --> 18:49.202
Is this about me grabbing Nat?

18:49.203 --> 18:50.803
You damn right it is.

18:50.804 --> 18:52.738
Listen, Brittany.

18:52.739 --> 18:55.341
I like letting men know
I'm more powerful than they are.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.343
Guys have done a lot
worse to both of us

18:57.344 --> 18:58.744
and gotten away with it.

18:58.745 --> 19:00.346
Now it's our turn.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.181
- Our turn?
- Mm-hmm.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.484
Bitch, we ain't jumping rope.

19:04.485 --> 19:06.745
We're trying to get it to where
everybody is respected.

19:07.341 --> 19:08.821
And if you're doing this to
people, that'll make you

19:08.822 --> 19:11.268
no better than the men you're
trying to get back at, Tia.

19:11.269 --> 19:14.671
You know what, Brittany, don't come
in my office judging me on how...

19:16.641 --> 19:18.675
Hey! Hey! Hey!

19:18.676 --> 19:20.177
Look here, now.

19:20.178 --> 19:21.793
I'm trying to record my podcast.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.596
Want me to lose all 44
of my listeners?

19:24.597 --> 19:26.731
Young Brittany, you're in
my office, you're loud.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.266
Can I help you with something?

19:28.267 --> 19:30.135
I'll tell you what you can
help me with.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.268
You need to give my friend back
his job.

19:32.269 --> 19:34.336
And tell Michelle Grope-bama
to back off of him.

19:35.939 --> 19:37.673
My friend Nat has been working hard

19:37.674 --> 19:39.141
to get his life back on track.

19:39.142 --> 19:40.576
And he deserves a fair shot.

19:40.577 --> 19:41.865
And if you don't give him one,

19:41.866 --> 19:43.125
I'm gonna have a camera crew

19:43.126 --> 19:43.804
down here,

19:43.805 --> 19:45.187
and I'm gonna give them an interview

19:45.188 --> 19:47.345
that tells them how
Alderman Littles has no morals

19:47.346 --> 19:49.014
and no principles,

19:49.015 --> 19:51.787
and how he turned a blind eye
to the He Too movement.

19:51.788 --> 19:54.456
W-W-Wait. He, too?

19:54.457 --> 19:56.225
Is that a movement?

19:56.226 --> 19:57.793
Is He Too a thing?

19:57.794 --> 19:59.161
It's a thing now.

20:00.063 --> 20:01.764
Okay. Like... hey.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.932
Look here, Ms. Brittany.

20:03.933 --> 20:05.434
You seem a tad bit upset.

20:05.435 --> 20:07.002
M-Maybe it's just a misunderstanding.

20:07.003 --> 20:10.072
Look, take a seat. Let's just talk.

20:10.073 --> 20:12.808
Okay, look at me. Let's conversate.

20:12.809 --> 20:17.880
I may be your alderman,
but now I'm your alder-friend.

20:17.881 --> 20:22.451
Let's reprogram this problem
and make it solutionable.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.155
Can you believe they let me open

20:26.156 --> 20:28.220
my own pop-up store for a month?

20:28.221 --> 20:29.487
Congratulations, man,

20:29.488 --> 20:31.046
- this is nice.
- Thank you.?

20:31.047 --> 20:32.615
Mm. Alderman Littles, he's the man.

20:32.616 --> 20:34.316
What?

20:34.317 --> 20:35.985
You got this 'cause of
my sexual harassment.

20:35.986 --> 20:37.720
You know that, right?

20:37.721 --> 20:39.321
Like, this whole entire establishment

20:39.322 --> 20:41.790
was built on my ass.

20:41.791 --> 20:44.126
Well, your ass really
cut through the red tape.

20:44.127 --> 20:46.562
Come on, son, look.

20:46.563 --> 20:48.685
The system has been unfair
to women in the workforce

20:48.686 --> 20:49.807
for over a hundred years,

20:49.808 --> 20:51.909
you think it's gonna change
for men overnight?

20:51.910 --> 20:56.047
Well, Windy City Politics.

20:58.851 --> 21:03.033
As a community, we need to
recognize the importance

21:03.034 --> 21:05.402
of non-gender-biased sexual harassment

21:05.403 --> 21:06.770
at the workplace.

21:06.771 --> 21:09.439
Be it man on man, woman on woman,

21:09.440 --> 21:12.876
woman on man,
man on man, it doesn't matter.

21:12.877 --> 21:17.714
We got to support the LGBTQRSTLMNOP,

21:17.715 --> 21:20.350
sometimes "Y" community.

21:20.351 --> 21:22.285
Alderman Littles does not see gender.

21:22.286 --> 21:24.087
You right there,

21:24.088 --> 21:26.957
I don't know if you're
my brother or my sister,

21:26.958 --> 21:29.092
but does that matter? No.

21:29.093 --> 21:31.395
Millie Bobby Brown
and regular Bobby Brown

21:31.396 --> 21:33.397
exist in the same world.

21:33.398 --> 21:36.869
And that is the community
we want to live in.

21:37.213 --> 21:44.468
