WEBVTT

00:00.208 --> 00:01.406
My name is Stephen Jameson.

00:01.410 --> 00:03.056
And I am one of the Tomorrow People.

00:03.068 --> 00:05.368
They call our powers the three T's.

00:05.372 --> 00:06.620
- Telepathy...
- Stephen?

00:06.640 --> 00:07.780
Telekinesis...

00:07.814 --> 00:09.114
And teleportation.

00:09.266 --> 00:12.468
There is a shadow war going
on between us and Ultra...

00:12.470 --> 00:14.937
- No!
-... the secret organization that hunts us.

00:14.939 --> 00:17.373
The only way to keep my
species from going extinct

00:17.375 --> 00:19.107
is to find my father.

00:19.109 --> 00:22.144
And the only way to do that
is by working for the enemy.

00:23.346 --> 00:25.113
Previously on The Tomorrow People...

00:25.115 --> 00:28.116
- A tracer.
- It's a tracking device, actually.

00:28.118 --> 00:31.253
Each dot represents a
paranormal tagged and released.

00:31.255 --> 00:33.222
You will lead them all to The Refuge.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.859
You gotta call Stephen
and your friends, now!

00:36.861 --> 00:38.893
What do you need?

00:38.895 --> 00:40.294
I think you may have to guide him back.

00:40.296 --> 00:43.030
I need to get into the machine at Ultra.

00:43.032 --> 00:44.532
Dad, come on.

00:47.135 --> 00:48.269
It's a heartbeat.

00:48.271 --> 00:49.937
His father's alive.

00:49.939 --> 00:53.140
And you're sure Stephen has no idea
he's been led exactly where we want him?

00:53.142 --> 00:54.141
None.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:26.574 --> 01:29.376
I can't believe my brother put
you, of all people, up to this.

01:30.611 --> 01:32.212
You don't have to do this, John.

01:32.214 --> 01:33.947
Why'd you have to turn against Ultra?

01:35.082 --> 01:36.549
I was protecting our kind.

01:38.152 --> 01:40.020
Now put the gun down.

01:40.022 --> 01:41.021
Ugh!

01:48.529 --> 01:49.595
Hey.

01:49.597 --> 01:50.930
There you are.

01:51.965 --> 01:53.999
Why don't you get some sleep?

01:54.001 --> 01:55.134
I'm fine.

01:57.003 --> 01:59.539
I'm used to 36-hour shifts.

01:59.541 --> 02:02.507
Besides, Luca's gonna be up soon.

02:02.509 --> 02:06.178
Okay, why don't you go see Luca.
I'll keep an eye on things here.

02:06.180 --> 02:09.381
There's a little pool going around
about who's gonna crash first. You or me.

02:09.383 --> 02:11.783
And it will not be me.

02:15.221 --> 02:18.757
I feel like if I close my
eyes now, I might not wake up.

02:25.865 --> 02:28.567
He's gonna pull through, Mom.

02:28.569 --> 02:31.536
Honey, we may have gotten
your father's heart to beat,

02:31.538 --> 02:34.205
but the rest of him...

02:34.207 --> 02:35.539
You two better get in here.

02:43.248 --> 02:44.648
Dad.

02:44.650 --> 02:46.451
Didn't mean to scare you.

02:46.453 --> 02:47.551
You're back.

02:48.988 --> 02:50.855
Ah, sure feels that way.

02:50.857 --> 02:53.123
Unless I'm dead and this is Heaven.

02:53.125 --> 02:55.258
Which would explain a lot.

02:55.260 --> 02:58.261
- Oh, my God, you're beautiful.
- Oh, my...

03:01.933 --> 03:03.333
Is this okay?

03:03.335 --> 03:04.502
Yeah, that's perfect.

03:08.006 --> 03:09.206
I don't believe it.

03:10.541 --> 03:12.942
Thanks for bringing me back from the dead.

03:12.944 --> 03:15.412
Ah, well, uh... it was a team effort.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.389
John.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.935
Roger, I, uh...

03:44.574 --> 03:46.375
- I'm sorry.
- No.

03:49.546 --> 03:52.381
You only did what you were supposed to do.

03:52.383 --> 03:54.417
The burden my brother
and I placed on you is...

03:56.419 --> 03:57.419
I'm sorry.

04:00.590 --> 04:04.325
- Where's Jedikiah?
- Oh, dude skipped out a while ago.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.994
Picked a hell of a time to leave.

04:08.965 --> 04:11.800
So... tell me how you did it.

04:11.802 --> 04:13.134
I brought you back.

04:14.236 --> 04:16.404
Mom patched up your body,

04:16.406 --> 04:20.375
and I used the Machine at Ultra
to bring back the rest of you.

04:20.377 --> 04:21.942
The Machine?

04:23.979 --> 04:25.246
The Founder's still alive?

04:25.248 --> 04:27.082
He doesn't know that you are.

04:28.751 --> 04:31.385
I need you to walk me through
everything you know about his plans.

04:31.387 --> 04:32.820
Hold on.

04:33.889 --> 04:35.890
Can we have a minute, please?

04:39.360 --> 04:40.654
After everything we've been through,

04:40.696 --> 04:42.796
you're just gonna pick
up where you left off?

04:42.898 --> 04:44.296
I mean, you think that's
why we brought you back?

04:44.316 --> 04:48.034
- Marla, I'm sorry...
- I need to go home and check in on Luca.

04:48.036 --> 04:50.270
I think you should come
home and see your son.

04:56.377 --> 04:58.945
- Look, Dad, I should, um...
- You should go.

05:04.384 --> 05:06.419
Hey, stranger, where you been?

05:06.421 --> 05:08.955
You're not gonna believe
what just happened.

05:08.957 --> 05:10.356
Oh, yeah? Try me.

05:11.976 --> 05:13.276
My dad woke up.

05:13.278 --> 05:14.644
That's great, right?

05:16.147 --> 05:18.581
Yeah, it's pretty great.

05:18.583 --> 05:21.284
Well, I don't want to
keep you from your family,

05:21.286 --> 05:24.287
but, um, if there's anything you need...

05:24.289 --> 05:27.256
Mind covering for me at
Ultra for a little longer?

05:27.258 --> 05:29.492
And, obviously, nobody
can know about my dad.

05:29.494 --> 05:32.227
Like I said, anything you need.

05:32.229 --> 05:34.062
Thank you, you're the best.

05:34.064 --> 05:35.597
I know.

05:35.599 --> 05:38.600
How thrilled Stephen must
be to have his father back.

05:40.136 --> 05:41.703
But for us,

05:41.705 --> 05:44.940
it's hardly a cause for celebration.

05:46.643 --> 05:51.079
The man has been frozen. You
really think he's still a threat?

05:51.081 --> 05:53.158
Not even your partner, a synergist,

05:53.159 --> 05:55.035
has been able to match his father's powers.

05:55.619 --> 05:57.686
And besides, it took me six years.

05:57.688 --> 06:00.288
Six years to rebuild what he destroyed.

06:01.657 --> 06:03.558
What do you want me to do?

06:03.560 --> 06:06.294
Get close to Roger and bring him in.

06:06.296 --> 06:08.095
How?

06:08.097 --> 06:11.899
Oh, Agent Cole, you've got the
boy eating out of your hand.

06:11.901 --> 06:13.234
You'll figure it out.

06:17.672 --> 06:19.440
So, what now?

06:19.442 --> 06:21.475
Is he gonna throw on a cape and
take us straight to the Refuge?

06:21.477 --> 06:23.377
Natalie, the dude just thawed out.

06:23.379 --> 06:24.645
One miracle at a time.

06:29.150 --> 06:32.118
Oh! I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't
realize you were in here.

06:32.120 --> 06:35.288
I was just trying to imagine how
people dressed topside these days.

06:35.290 --> 06:36.923
Does this work?

06:36.925 --> 06:38.726
Timeless.

06:38.728 --> 06:42.662
But who said anything about going topside?

06:42.664 --> 06:46.599
I've been trapped between the here
and the hereafter for way too long.

06:46.601 --> 06:49.002
I have to go home.

06:49.004 --> 06:52.438
Roger, our people believe
that you're their savior.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.440
You can't just walk out on them.

06:56.143 --> 06:57.910
I already gave up one life, Cara.

06:59.145 --> 07:00.279
It's my family's turn.

07:02.349 --> 07:03.483
I'll be back.

07:03.485 --> 07:05.084
Ultra is still out there.

07:05.086 --> 07:06.452
If you get caught, you could be...

07:06.454 --> 07:08.153
I appreciate the concern.

07:08.155 --> 07:10.656
But I'm pretty sure I broke
out before you were born.

07:10.658 --> 07:12.958
I can handle it.

07:17.163 --> 07:20.699
I know that you missed out
on a lot with your family.

07:20.701 --> 07:24.036
But I'm responsible for the
safety of everyone down here now.

07:25.105 --> 07:27.672
I'm sorry, I can't let you leave.

07:30.111 --> 07:32.377
Well, I guess we're at an impasse.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.214
You remember how we settle impasses.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.684
I don't want to fight you, Cara.

07:39.686 --> 07:41.986
Maybe you'd prefer to jaunt me.

07:46.426 --> 07:48.526
This is the only way?

07:48.528 --> 07:50.128
You made the rules, didn't you?

07:52.164 --> 07:53.331
I'll clear the room.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.503
We don't have to do this, John.

07:59.505 --> 08:02.407
If there was something you wanted
to discuss, you should've said so.

08:04.342 --> 08:07.377
This isn't about me. This is about them.

08:07.379 --> 08:09.056
Hey, what's going on?

08:09.057 --> 08:10.357
Why is everyone getting kicked out of...

08:10.917 --> 08:13.383
Holy Ali-Frazier, is this for real?

08:13.385 --> 08:16.086
Go ahead, John. It's all yours.

08:42.645 --> 08:44.212
Not pulling any punches, are you?

08:50.988 --> 08:53.489
What is John doing? It's like he's...

08:53.491 --> 08:54.991
He wants to get hurt.

09:14.076 --> 09:15.944
I'm going to see my family.

09:17.881 --> 09:19.481
Who the hell are we?

09:29.225 --> 09:32.327
I spent six years thinking I killed
the man who could've saved us.

09:34.063 --> 09:36.531
Now he's abandoning you all over again.

09:36.533 --> 09:37.965
All of us.

09:40.302 --> 09:43.103
Only this time I can't
create another hero myth.

09:43.105 --> 09:45.105
This time, we need the real thing.

09:48.238 --> 09:53.520
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

10:24.948 --> 10:26.383
I didn't hear you come in.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.986
Not much has changed.

10:33.323 --> 10:35.124
Everything has changed.

10:35.126 --> 10:36.926
Hmm. Yeah.

10:40.364 --> 10:45.167
I know I can't make up
for the lost time, and...

10:45.169 --> 10:47.236
You have a whole life
that I'm not a part of.

10:49.139 --> 10:51.540
Whatever I can do to make it easier,

10:51.542 --> 10:52.541
I will.

10:55.011 --> 10:56.077
Just...

10:58.281 --> 10:59.415
Be here.

11:12.528 --> 11:15.130
- Hey, honey.
- Hello, Luca.

11:17.566 --> 11:19.234
I know this is a lot to take in...

11:23.772 --> 11:25.239
Luca, you're staying.

11:25.241 --> 11:28.008
No can do, bro, I have a plans tonight.

11:28.010 --> 11:30.110
So cancel them.

11:30.112 --> 11:32.012
Well, what am I supposed to say?

11:32.014 --> 11:33.881
"Hey guys. Sorry, uh, raincheck.

11:33.883 --> 11:36.283
"My dead dad is suddenly
back from the netherworld."

11:36.285 --> 11:37.485
Well, I wouldn't get that specific.

11:37.487 --> 11:38.953
How is he even here?

11:38.955 --> 11:41.288
Doesn't matter. He is, okay?

11:41.290 --> 11:44.258
He's our dad. And he's making dinner.

11:44.260 --> 11:45.859
Guy doesn't know a thing about me.

11:45.861 --> 11:49.096
Great, you'll have lots
to talk about. Let's go.

11:49.098 --> 11:52.132
This is gonna be the most
awkward-ass night of my life.

11:53.201 --> 11:55.836
We need a buffer.

11:58.473 --> 12:00.373
Hey, thank you for coming.

12:00.375 --> 12:01.341
Of course.

12:02.510 --> 12:04.177
You wanna meet my dad?

12:04.179 --> 12:05.946
Again?

12:05.948 --> 12:06.947
- Yeah.
- Come on.

12:11.118 --> 12:12.786
Dad?

12:12.788 --> 12:14.287
You remember Astrid?

12:14.289 --> 12:16.222
- Astrid.
- Hey.

12:16.224 --> 12:18.257
What happened to that
chubby-cheeked little girl?

12:18.259 --> 12:20.493
Little girl got all growed up.

12:20.495 --> 12:23.062
- Astrid, you look lovely.
- Thanks.

12:23.064 --> 12:24.364
Dinner's ready, let's eat.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.367
I got it.

12:27.369 --> 12:29.835
I wonder who that is? Dead grandpa?

12:32.572 --> 12:36.909
- Hey.
- Hey, um... what are you doing here?

12:36.911 --> 12:38.878
Interrupting, apparently.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.379
- No.
- Not at all.

12:40.381 --> 12:42.280
- I'm Stephen's dad, Roger.
- Hillary.

12:42.282 --> 12:45.017
Nice to meet you. Do you
like chicken parmesan?

12:45.019 --> 12:48.153
Of course you do, what's
not to like? Come, eat.

12:48.155 --> 12:51.990
- Well, I don't want to interrupt family time.
- Come on, come in.

12:51.992 --> 12:53.392
Okay, maybe just a bite.

13:05.470 --> 13:08.372
This is nice. Having
everyone together for dinner.

13:08.374 --> 13:11.809
Yeah. Dad, your chicken parm's
even better than I remember.

13:15.313 --> 13:17.949
I can't do this.

13:17.951 --> 13:19.751
- Luca.
- What?

13:19.753 --> 13:23.454
Am I supposed to just sit here
and pretend like this is normal?

13:23.456 --> 13:25.489
That we're normal?

13:25.491 --> 13:28.092
That Dad hasn't been gone for ten years?

13:28.094 --> 13:31.062
That my mom and brother aren't mutants?

13:31.064 --> 13:33.531
- Okay, this is not the time to do this.
- Why not?

13:33.533 --> 13:35.132
Astrid knows everything.

13:35.134 --> 13:38.802
I'm sure Stephen's, uh,
paranormal girlfriend does, too.

13:38.804 --> 13:40.270
Luca? Enough.

13:40.272 --> 13:41.271
It's all right.

13:42.406 --> 13:46.076
I know this is... weird.

13:46.078 --> 13:51.014
And my apologies to those of
you who aren't family, uh...

13:53.250 --> 13:55.285
I'm as disoriented as any of you.

13:57.254 --> 13:59.922
But I'm also very, very happy.

14:02.460 --> 14:04.994
No, happy...

14:04.996 --> 14:08.098
doesn't even begin to describe it, I...

14:08.100 --> 14:10.933
am overwhelmed with love,

14:10.935 --> 14:13.335
and gratitude for the three of you.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.773
You're my world.

14:17.775 --> 14:20.409
You're my reason for being.

14:20.411 --> 14:21.811
And, I...

14:22.946 --> 14:24.246
am humbled

14:25.749 --> 14:27.216
to be back in this home.

14:31.354 --> 14:33.054
Let's all raise our glasses.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.428
Here's to family.

14:39.430 --> 14:40.829
To family.

14:52.842 --> 14:54.542
Not to complain, per se,

14:54.544 --> 14:57.112
but some of us are kind of
wondering where the hell Roger is.

14:57.114 --> 15:00.181
He's been away from his family
for years, he needs time with them.

15:00.183 --> 15:02.883
- He'll be back soon.
- When? What's the plan?

15:02.885 --> 15:06.220
I mean, we wait for him all these
years and then he just bails on us?

15:06.222 --> 15:07.955
What kind of savior is that?

15:07.957 --> 15:11.892
Hey, let's not get all Lord
of the Flies here, people.

15:11.894 --> 15:14.128
- It's all good.
- If you say so.

15:16.197 --> 15:17.364
Thanks.

15:18.366 --> 15:20.067
It is so not all good.

15:20.069 --> 15:21.969
Clearly.

15:26.574 --> 15:29.209
Mmm, well, I hope you all
saved some room for dessert.

15:29.211 --> 15:30.377
Oh, let me give you a hand.

15:30.379 --> 15:32.512
Okay.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.315
Wow, first time he's
done that in ten years.

15:37.052 --> 15:39.186
What do you say we get a little fresh air?

15:39.188 --> 15:40.253
Yeah.

15:40.255 --> 15:41.221
Pardon us.

15:48.462 --> 15:49.962
Nice night.

15:53.466 --> 15:56.268
Listen, Hillary, this better be for real.

15:56.270 --> 15:59.605
Stephen is my best friend
and he's a very special guy...

15:59.607 --> 16:01.140
- I'm aware.
- I'm still talking.

16:02.876 --> 16:04.877
He's got a lot going on right now,

16:04.879 --> 16:07.179
and he needs someone he
can trust and rely on,

16:07.181 --> 16:09.715
and if that happens to be you...

16:11.017 --> 16:12.818
Then great.

16:12.820 --> 16:14.820
- But if it's not...
- I'm in love with him.

16:16.055 --> 16:17.956
Does that answer your question?

16:17.958 --> 16:18.924
Excuse me.

16:24.097 --> 16:27.332
So, Hillary. She seems like a nice girl.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.433
Yeah, she is.

16:30.502 --> 16:32.771
When were you gonna tell
me you were leaving again?

16:35.975 --> 16:38.809
It's only a matter of time before
the Founder finds out I'm back.

16:38.811 --> 16:40.745
So, what, you're gonna run?

16:40.747 --> 16:43.080
Strategic retreat.

16:43.082 --> 16:46.951
If he forces me into that machine,
those people inside are all in danger.

16:49.921 --> 16:50.955
So now what?

16:52.491 --> 16:53.491
Smile.

16:54.893 --> 16:56.193
Enjoy the time we have.

16:57.963 --> 17:01.232
And be the man who I'm so
damn proud to call my son.

17:03.368 --> 17:06.703
I know this is not what you had planned.

17:06.704 --> 17:08.772
But everything I'm doing,
everything I've done,

17:08.775 --> 17:10.775
has been to keep this family safe.

17:10.777 --> 17:12.175
Eyes on the target.

17:12.176 --> 17:14.042
Do we have a green light
for extraction, Agent Cole?

17:14.045 --> 17:16.246
Let's go back inside, before your
mom sends out a search party...

17:16.248 --> 17:19.082
Are you reading me, Agent Cole?
Are we a go for extraction team?

17:19.084 --> 17:21.917
Negative, we missed our
window. We'll get him later.

17:33.544 --> 17:35.645
Hey, what's up, Charlie?

17:35.647 --> 17:37.747
People are losing it in the Lair.

17:37.749 --> 17:41.183
Talking about leaving,
going out on their own.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.519
Why are they so unhappy?
I love it down here.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.787
I know you do, Charlie.

17:45.789 --> 17:48.391
Well, the man they thought
was gonna lead them just left.

17:48.393 --> 17:50.659
I guess they feel a little lost.

17:50.661 --> 17:52.495
But you and Cara are leaders now.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.957
Roger was the one...

17:56.958 --> 18:00.092
they thought was gonna come back
and save them from this life.

18:01.437 --> 18:03.705
And now that he's left
them all over again...

18:03.707 --> 18:06.441
They only believed in Roger

18:06.443 --> 18:07.643
because you did.

18:09.412 --> 18:11.079
You're my hero, John.

18:19.422 --> 18:20.655
I think you've had enough.

18:22.324 --> 18:23.624
That was for you.

18:23.626 --> 18:27.028
Oh, awfully nice of you.
Know what would've been nicer?

18:27.030 --> 18:29.229
If you'd been there when
I came back from the dead.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.501
Man.

18:34.503 --> 18:39.073
Six years though, Roger, I just
couldn't look you in the eye.

18:39.075 --> 18:40.307
It's not your fault.

18:44.312 --> 18:46.146
I really wanted to bring you back sooner.

18:46.148 --> 18:48.615
But you didn't have the means.

18:48.617 --> 18:51.785
- I'm letting you off the hook here, Jed.
- Ah, don't do that.

18:54.189 --> 18:55.975
The truth of the matter
was, while you were gone,

18:55.976 --> 18:58.160
I was the powerful brother for once,

18:58.260 --> 18:59.693
and...

18:59.695 --> 19:01.962
I liked it.

19:01.964 --> 19:03.697
I know that's a horrible thing to admit.

19:03.699 --> 19:06.099
I knew what I was getting into.

19:08.502 --> 19:10.269
I knew I was looking at a one-way trip.

19:12.206 --> 19:14.608
Thanks for looking after my family.

19:14.610 --> 19:17.744
Thanks for bringing me back to 'em.

19:17.746 --> 19:19.645
As short as it was.

19:19.647 --> 19:22.582
You're going underground.

19:22.584 --> 19:25.017
As long as I'm around, the
Founder has a terrible weapon.

19:25.019 --> 19:26.596
No, you can't run away now.

19:26.597 --> 19:28.785
The Founder is grooming
Stephen to take your place.

19:28.788 --> 19:29.764
No, he's just a boy.

19:29.765 --> 19:31.765
Do I have to give you a
refresher course in genetics?

19:32.327 --> 19:36.394
Our friend has beta-tested
your son in the Machine.

19:36.396 --> 19:38.196
- Did it work?
- I don't know.

19:38.198 --> 19:39.765
- Is it armed?
- I don't know.

19:39.767 --> 19:41.233
I... I've been in exile from Ultra.

19:43.770 --> 19:45.638
There's one way to find out.

19:51.477 --> 19:54.045
Still going for a minimalist vibe?

19:54.047 --> 19:55.413
No girlfriend, no pets.

19:56.549 --> 19:58.550
Please tell me you picked up a hobby.

19:58.552 --> 20:00.352
I've been a tad busy, Rog.

20:07.493 --> 20:09.393
Come on, Alice.

20:09.395 --> 20:11.495
Hello, Jed. What a nice surprise.

20:11.497 --> 20:14.231
Oh, you're dating a
computer. I should've guessed.

20:14.233 --> 20:15.533
Yeah, you got me.

20:15.535 --> 20:19.470
Hi, Alice, can you initiate
Protocol 1-3-5-9, please?

20:19.472 --> 20:21.605
Why does it feel like we're being naughty?

20:21.607 --> 20:23.541
Well, it's because we are.

20:23.543 --> 20:27.378
Wouldn't want the Founder secretly
spying on us, now would we?

20:27.380 --> 20:32.550
Now, I want all the field data
pertaining to this project.

20:32.552 --> 20:34.785
Your partner's so-called Machine?

20:34.787 --> 20:36.387
We're not partners anymore, love.

20:36.389 --> 20:38.722
Downloading it to your drive now.

20:38.724 --> 20:40.658
That does feel naughty.

20:40.660 --> 20:42.559
Thank you, love.

20:42.561 --> 20:43.685
I suppose I shouldn't share this either,

20:43.686 --> 20:45.410
but agents have been dispatched.

20:47.565 --> 20:49.399
- We gotta go.
- No, we're not done yet.

20:49.401 --> 20:51.568
- Jed, we gotta go.
- We're not done yet.

20:59.443 --> 21:02.345
- We need your help.
- Actually, we need Tim's help.

21:02.347 --> 21:06.015
I know you're upset with me, John,
but please, do it for Stephen.

21:06.017 --> 21:07.483
What is it?

21:07.485 --> 21:09.619
If we're lucky, it's nothing.

21:22.265 --> 21:23.632
You better get Stephen.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.407
It's the first time I used the Machine.

21:32.409 --> 21:34.276
When I realized it could take me to you.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.313
Who are they?

21:38.315 --> 21:40.482
Test subjects.

21:40.484 --> 21:44.152
What you're looking at now is footage
from an Ultra facility reserved for...

21:44.154 --> 21:46.054
"sensitive experiments."

21:46.056 --> 21:47.822
Those two rooms are connected remotely.

21:50.292 --> 21:52.160
The one in white, he's not moving.

21:52.162 --> 21:54.195
- What's wrong with him?
- He's human.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.232
The other one's like you.

21:57.234 --> 21:58.466
Only far more cruel.

22:04.506 --> 22:07.074
Wait, um... I did that?

22:08.609 --> 22:11.478
No, paranormals can't kill.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.647
It's not murder if the human isn't alive.

22:13.649 --> 22:17.217
That's the consequence
of you stopping time.

22:17.219 --> 22:18.786
What you just saw was a fraction

22:18.788 --> 22:22.022
of what the machine'll do
at full power with me in it.

22:22.024 --> 22:23.523
Or you.

22:23.525 --> 22:25.659
I'm sorry, Stephen.

22:25.661 --> 22:27.294
Looks like you take after me after all.

22:33.558 --> 22:36.758
See, first, you failed to apprehend
Roger when he was in your sights...

22:37.062 --> 22:40.365
And now it appears there's been a
break-in, at Jedikiah's former home,

22:40.367 --> 22:44.569
where someone has accessed our intranet.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.805
Not sure I heard the question.

22:46.807 --> 22:49.740
Well, I wonder...

22:49.742 --> 22:52.777
whether your emotions haven't
compromised you, Agent Cole.

22:52.779 --> 22:55.346
My emotions. Hmm.

22:55.348 --> 22:57.615
I was on my way to deliver new intel,

22:57.617 --> 22:59.884
but if you feel as though I
should be taken off the mission...

22:59.886 --> 23:03.021
What exactly did you find?

23:03.023 --> 23:05.956
Roger knows that you rebuilt the
Machine and that you want him in it.

23:05.958 --> 23:08.344
He was speaking to Stephen as
though he was saying goodbye,

23:08.345 --> 23:09.665
possibly skipping town.

23:11.730 --> 23:16.801
Well, if he knows all that then we're
not dealing with a man who's running away.

23:16.803 --> 23:19.637
He'll be coming right at us.

23:19.639 --> 23:22.906
- Uh, what is that?
- Supplies.

23:22.908 --> 23:25.608
Mind giving us a heads-up
on what the plan is?

23:25.610 --> 23:29.313
I'm going into Ultra, and sabotaging
the Founder's secret project.

23:29.315 --> 23:30.848
'Cause that worked so well last time.

23:30.850 --> 23:33.283
Well, I did destroy the Machine.

23:33.285 --> 23:35.319
And yourself, your family.

23:35.321 --> 23:36.320
And us.

23:37.455 --> 23:39.489
I know what I did to you.

23:39.491 --> 23:40.457
I'm sorry.

23:41.792 --> 23:44.394
But there's no other way.
There's too much at stake.

23:44.396 --> 23:46.249
Dad, the Founder wants you in the Machine,

23:46.250 --> 23:47.626
you can't go anywhere near it.

23:47.899 --> 23:49.966
It is bound to me.

23:49.968 --> 23:51.801
This is a piece of it.

23:51.803 --> 23:54.470
It's tied to my DNA, it's inside of it.

23:54.472 --> 23:56.973
Which means no one else can get
near it without triggering the alarm.

23:56.975 --> 24:00.076
- I'm coming with you.
- You can help get me in, and that's it.

24:00.078 --> 24:01.911
If I teleport, they'll detect me.

24:01.913 --> 24:03.571
I'm pretty sure they'll
detect an explosion,

24:03.572 --> 24:05.290
then they'll fire up
every D-chip in Ultra.

24:05.350 --> 24:06.749
Meaning you'll have to hoof your way out.

24:08.919 --> 24:10.619
So, wait...

24:10.621 --> 24:14.890
Roger came back, and now we're
blowing up our ticket to the Refuge?

24:14.892 --> 24:17.526
I'm sorry, isn't that what we've
been waiting for all this time?

24:17.528 --> 24:19.194
The plan has changed.

24:19.196 --> 24:22.297
Something awful happens to humans
when the Machine is turned on.

24:22.299 --> 24:25.701
Who cares? We've been offered a truce.

24:25.703 --> 24:28.736
Russell went inside Ultra and lived
to tell the tale, so why can't we?

24:28.738 --> 24:31.739
Natalie, we need to stay unified.

24:31.741 --> 24:33.308
In this gutter?

24:33.310 --> 24:37.045
While our leader is off starting
yet another fight with the Founder?

24:37.047 --> 24:40.481
I don't know about you guys, but I
would rather be unified in the Refuge.

24:40.483 --> 24:43.951
There is no Refuge. No promised land.

24:43.953 --> 24:45.920
This is the only world there is.

24:45.922 --> 24:48.776
But the Founder wants to use
the Machine to kill every man,

24:48.777 --> 24:51.136
woman and child on the planet.

24:51.140 --> 24:53.661
Every human man, woman and child.

24:55.697 --> 24:58.399
I'm sorry. I can't let that happen.

25:00.601 --> 25:01.936
Well, you can't keep me here, either.

25:03.338 --> 25:04.939
I'm going topside.

25:04.941 --> 25:08.342
I'm gonna make my own peace
with Ultra before his father,

25:08.344 --> 25:11.545
our absentee messiah,
blows everything to hell.

25:12.847 --> 25:14.315
Who's coming with me?

25:23.724 --> 25:25.692
If they turn themselves in to Ultra...

25:25.694 --> 25:27.861
I know, they could give
us up, and my dad's plan.

25:27.863 --> 25:29.663
Well, it looks like that
plan just got moved up.

25:33.633 --> 25:36.369
Fine, I will keep an eye on them.

25:37.438 --> 25:40.906
Make sure they don't
do anything dumb... er.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.356
Hey.

25:57.358 --> 25:58.991
Hey.

25:58.993 --> 26:01.026
I hope it wasn't too awkward,
me crashing your family reunion.

26:01.028 --> 26:03.295
Uh, no, it was really awkward.

26:03.297 --> 26:04.663
Great.

26:04.665 --> 26:08.700
But not because of you.
That part was kind of nice.

26:08.702 --> 26:10.268
Uh, what's going on?

26:11.471 --> 26:12.904
Um...

26:12.906 --> 26:14.272
I don't know.

26:18.511 --> 26:20.845
Hey! What is it?

26:20.847 --> 26:22.814
Look, it's supposed to be classified.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.249
And you don't trust me?

26:28.353 --> 26:30.555
The Machine is being relocated.

26:30.557 --> 26:32.456
Why?

26:32.458 --> 26:34.592
Because the Founder's afraid.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.494
Of what?

26:36.496 --> 26:37.529
Jedikiah.

26:37.531 --> 26:40.764
He thinks he wants to destroy it.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.667
Hillary, you didn't tell
him about my father, did you?

26:43.669 --> 26:44.735
No, of course not.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.505
Do you know where he's taking it?

26:51.543 --> 26:53.544
Dad, it's a black site near the port.

26:53.546 --> 26:55.801
The plan is to move the
Machine on a barge somewhere.

26:55.802 --> 26:56.702
We have to intercept it.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.415
I'll meet you there.

26:58.417 --> 27:01.251
I'm gonna need you to shut down
the perimeter, and then get out.

27:02.453 --> 27:03.787
Got it.

27:11.829 --> 27:13.229
You just got home.

27:15.466 --> 27:17.400
All I want is to lie in bed with you.

27:18.602 --> 27:20.403
And shoot hoops with my boys.

27:21.572 --> 27:22.638
But this won't wait.

27:27.278 --> 27:28.378
I know.

27:30.948 --> 27:34.684
I'm not so naive to think things
would be normal with you coming back.

27:36.453 --> 27:37.720
We were never normal.

27:39.690 --> 27:41.824
Maybe if I'd embraced that
fact from the beginning...

27:41.826 --> 27:42.858
No.

27:44.294 --> 27:46.595
You did everything right.

27:46.597 --> 27:48.464
Everything good about this family is you.

27:49.865 --> 27:52.434
That reckless kid out there trying to...

27:52.436 --> 27:53.635
save the world.

27:55.004 --> 27:56.605
He takes after me.

27:59.476 --> 28:00.609
After us.

28:12.554 --> 28:14.622
I should talk to Luca.

28:14.624 --> 28:16.224
It's okay.

28:16.226 --> 28:17.291
I'll explain.

28:17.293 --> 28:19.260
And you'll be back.

29:21.722 --> 29:25.624
Okay. I got you, Dad. D-chips are down.

29:25.626 --> 29:26.792
Coast looks clear.

29:34.734 --> 29:36.902
What are you doing, John?

29:36.904 --> 29:38.536
I'm sorry, Roger.

29:49.249 --> 29:51.278
You have no idea what I've been through.

29:52.253 --> 29:54.286
Six years of lying to our people.

29:54.288 --> 29:58.123
Keeping them alive on the hope that
one day you'd return to save them.

30:02.094 --> 30:03.862
I never meant to hurt you, John.

30:03.864 --> 30:05.196
I'm not gonna let you do this.

30:05.198 --> 30:07.232
You can't access the Machine without me.

30:09.869 --> 30:11.236
I already have you.

30:13.372 --> 30:15.773
Go home, Roger.

30:15.775 --> 30:17.975
Be the leader I promised you'd be.

30:19.210 --> 30:21.945
John. Please don't do this.

30:45.002 --> 30:46.903
Dad, where are you? I lost you.

30:50.274 --> 30:51.541
John?

30:51.543 --> 30:52.842
Get him out of here now.

30:54.345 --> 30:56.446
What did you do?

30:56.448 --> 30:58.114
He's fine, but in 30 seconds
when I blow up this Machine,

30:58.115 --> 30:59.385
all hell's gonna break loose.

31:01.552 --> 31:03.286
Stop! You can't go down there.

31:03.288 --> 31:05.288
- What are you doing here?
- I am saving you from making a mistake

31:05.290 --> 31:07.790
and getting taken down with your dad.

31:07.792 --> 31:09.391
What?

31:09.393 --> 31:11.894
He is a terrorist, it's too late for
him, but it's not too late for you.

31:11.896 --> 31:12.962
The Founder will still forgive you.

31:12.964 --> 31:14.063
No.

31:14.065 --> 31:15.464
John, it's a trap.

31:15.466 --> 31:17.366
Stephen, they can't hear
you. The D-chips are back up.

31:18.868 --> 31:20.135
How could you?

31:20.137 --> 31:22.070
I care about you, I am
doing this to protect you.

31:22.072 --> 31:25.106
You have no idea what you've done.

31:46.996 --> 31:48.296
He wants him alive.

32:16.591 --> 32:17.992
Come on.

32:23.865 --> 32:24.964
Wakey-wakey.

32:26.768 --> 32:29.936
Not the man I was
expecting to open that door.

32:29.938 --> 32:32.105
Where is Roger?

32:32.107 --> 32:33.707
I don't know.

32:33.709 --> 32:36.443
Under the circumstances, I'd
advise you not to lie to me.

32:36.445 --> 32:38.077
If you want to kill innocent people,

32:38.079 --> 32:39.946
you better find someone
else to put in your Machine.

32:39.948 --> 32:41.480
Now, there are no innocent people.

32:41.482 --> 32:44.350
People would turn you inside
out, given half the chance.

32:44.352 --> 32:46.485
Dissecting your body to reveal its secrets.

32:46.487 --> 32:48.388
Jealous of your god-given gifts.

32:48.390 --> 32:50.423
People like Jedikiah.

32:50.425 --> 32:53.893
The man who turned you into a freak!

32:53.895 --> 32:55.773
See, I'm trying to forge a world in which

32:55.774 --> 32:58.880
you can rise out of your sewer a free man!

32:59.567 --> 33:01.801
With the woman you love.

33:01.803 --> 33:04.069
And the life you deserve.

33:10.844 --> 33:13.845
I'd rather die than give up Roger.

33:16.482 --> 33:19.318
You see, you're the only
one who can kill, John.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.420
You're the only one.

33:21.422 --> 33:23.956
But since you're so keen on mankind...

33:25.825 --> 33:27.359
Perhaps you'd like to join them.

33:32.898 --> 33:35.199
This is your last chance.

33:35.201 --> 33:37.368
Where is he?

33:43.509 --> 33:44.976
You leave me no choice.

33:46.345 --> 33:47.311
Hit him.

34:02.794 --> 34:03.760
Again.

34:13.404 --> 34:14.404
Again!

34:42.266 --> 34:43.833
They all go eventually.

34:52.543 --> 34:54.665
Sign me up, this place is amazing!

34:55.147 --> 34:58.483
Yeah, it's like Steve
Jobs redid the Death Star.

34:58.485 --> 35:02.220
Look, how do we know that they won't
give us the serum that takes our powers?

35:02.222 --> 35:04.588
Ultra's not exactly known for honesty.

35:04.590 --> 35:07.324
Right, 'cause Roger kept his promise.

35:07.326 --> 35:09.160
Thank you for your patience.

35:09.162 --> 35:10.995
Welcome to Ultra.

35:10.997 --> 35:13.364
It's nice to see you again, Russell.

35:13.366 --> 35:15.199
Oh, hey.

35:15.201 --> 35:18.202
I assume you're all here for the tracer.

35:18.204 --> 35:19.703
I know it seems scary...

35:19.705 --> 35:21.305
But honestly?

35:21.307 --> 35:24.508
The process is no more
painful than a flu shot.

35:24.510 --> 35:27.110
Who would like to go first?

35:27.112 --> 35:29.380
You? You must have read my mind.

35:29.382 --> 35:32.249
Uh, maybe we should talk about this?

35:32.251 --> 35:34.385
It's her first time at Ultra.

35:34.387 --> 35:36.386
This place is lined with D-chips.

35:36.388 --> 35:39.222
If something goes down, we
can't even call for help.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.828
So what exactly does that shot do?

35:44.830 --> 35:48.398
It allows us to keep track of our
kind, in the event of an emergency.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.015
Besides, you don't want to get lost

35:50.016 --> 35:52.726
when we finally make our way
to the Refuge, now do you?

35:53.737 --> 35:55.338
- I'm in.
- No.

35:57.140 --> 35:58.274
I'll go first.

35:59.543 --> 36:01.210
If this goes gnarly,

36:01.212 --> 36:03.346
I want you to take the others and get
the hell out of here, you got that?

36:16.059 --> 36:17.193
Hold still.

36:31.073 --> 36:32.173
See?

36:32.175 --> 36:34.476
That wasn't so bad.

36:34.478 --> 36:35.610
Who's next?

36:44.854 --> 36:46.254
Can I sit?

36:48.290 --> 36:49.390
Suit yourself.

36:54.596 --> 36:55.663
What is it?

36:58.633 --> 37:00.434
I really messed up, Astrid.

37:01.837 --> 37:04.538
And I know that you never trusted me.

37:04.540 --> 37:06.240
And you were right not to.

37:07.409 --> 37:10.177
But, it wasn't about Stephen.

37:11.747 --> 37:13.381
I really do love him.

37:14.616 --> 37:16.149
Why are you telling me?

37:19.553 --> 37:21.421
Because...

37:21.423 --> 37:24.191
I need you to do me a favor.

37:24.193 --> 37:26.426
I just want to make things right with him.

37:30.631 --> 37:31.998
I need you

37:33.200 --> 37:35.301
to call me

37:35.303 --> 37:37.336
at this number in one hour.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.173
Can you do that?

37:41.175 --> 37:42.108
Why?

37:44.311 --> 37:46.746
It's the only way to help them.

37:46.748 --> 37:48.180
Help all of them.

37:49.516 --> 37:51.583
Just please say that you'll do it.

37:51.585 --> 37:53.585
Okay.

37:53.587 --> 37:54.720
I'll call.

38:01.494 --> 38:04.030
One hour. On the dot.

38:29.155 --> 38:31.689
If you're gonna have me killed...

38:31.691 --> 38:34.192
just do it already.

38:34.194 --> 38:36.627
Oh, no, John, why would I want to do that?

38:36.629 --> 38:38.228
No, I've got a job for you.

38:39.431 --> 38:41.699
You're going to deliver a message for me.

38:47.305 --> 38:49.273
So, how long do we have to stay here?

38:49.275 --> 38:51.609
Just until you and Luca are safe.

38:51.611 --> 38:52.743
Sorry, Mom.

38:52.745 --> 38:53.744
Dad!

38:56.181 --> 38:57.181
Hey, buddy.

38:59.184 --> 39:00.150
You're okay?

39:05.190 --> 39:06.556
I need a minute with your brother.

39:06.558 --> 39:08.558
Luca, let me show you around.

39:14.031 --> 39:16.500
Dad, we're back at war, the
Founder knows everything.

39:16.502 --> 39:18.201
And he's gonna come after us.

39:18.203 --> 39:21.004
And unless we take him out, he's going
after every human being on the planet.

39:21.006 --> 39:24.574
Then you are clearly going to need me.

39:24.576 --> 39:26.506
With the Machine still operational,

39:26.507 --> 39:27.893
the Founder more dangerous than ever?

39:30.447 --> 39:32.482
Then it's a good thing we're together.

39:34.018 --> 39:35.018
Yeah.

39:48.698 --> 39:52.768
John, do you hear me? John?

39:52.770 --> 39:55.671
I am so sorry, Stephen.

39:55.673 --> 39:57.773
You will never know how sorry I am.

39:57.775 --> 40:00.542
Hillary, you used me,
you betrayed me, you...

40:00.544 --> 40:02.144
I loved you.

40:03.246 --> 40:04.579
Goodbye, Stephen.

40:07.216 --> 40:08.650
Wait.

40:08.652 --> 40:10.085
Hillary?

40:20.062 --> 40:22.296
Sir? Do you have a moment?

40:22.298 --> 40:24.599
For you, Agent Cole?

40:24.601 --> 40:27.769
We're quite well positioned, thanks to you.

40:27.771 --> 40:31.673
Not exactly as I'd anticipated,
but well positioned nonetheless.

40:33.208 --> 40:36.177
We sold out our entire species.

40:36.179 --> 40:37.578
And I sold out Stephen.

40:39.047 --> 40:40.214
Really?

40:41.416 --> 40:44.151
Well, I'd never imagined
your girlish interior life.

40:44.153 --> 40:46.253
It's... charming.

40:46.255 --> 40:49.256
But Agent Cole, we've sold out no one.

40:49.258 --> 40:53.827
We are merely protecting Stephen and
his fellow rebels from themselves.

40:53.829 --> 40:59.365
I assure you, the end we are fast
approaching is to the benefit of all our kind.

41:01.202 --> 41:02.402
And the humans?

41:03.771 --> 41:07.140
Whatever fate they meet,
they brought upon themselves.

41:13.547 --> 41:15.715
My whole life

41:15.717 --> 41:17.183
I wanted to be a hero.

41:20.687 --> 41:23.422
I have finally found a way.

41:23.424 --> 41:24.490
Meaning?

41:26.126 --> 41:27.459
It's time for you to die.

41:31.396 --> 41:34.599
Well, if only our kind could kill.

41:35.635 --> 41:38.136
It's our most refined quality.

41:38.138 --> 41:41.106
Could someone please come in
here and escort Agent Cole to...

41:41.108 --> 41:42.607
I'm not gonna kill you.

41:47.446 --> 41:48.446
It's for you.
