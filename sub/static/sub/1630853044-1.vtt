WEBVTT

00:29.167 --> 00:34.958
I started working in the North Sea
when I was 18. Yes, it was back in 71.

00:35.125 --> 00:37.833
Starting to be long ago by now.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.542
Yeah, and it paid so well.

00:43.708 --> 00:47.375
Two weeks out, and
four weeks at home for me.

00:52.333 --> 00:55.875
We had no idea what we
entered into.

00:56.042 --> 01:00.167
Zero training.
Just follow the yanks.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.917
Go left they said,
so we went left.

01:04.833 --> 01:08.500
I remember back then
it being a bit dangerous.

01:09.583 --> 01:14.792
But it was a risk
we were willing to take.

01:15.833 --> 01:20.667
Or to be exact, we
didn't think about it.

01:23.375 --> 01:27.625
Everybody were making money, after all.
The entire nation was making money.

01:29.625 --> 01:33.833
But I suppose it's like driving a car.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.292
If you drive way too fast, for
way too long, it won't go well.

01:40.833 --> 01:46.042
"Risk of unwanted incidents"
as we call it in the oil biz.

02:54.458 --> 02:58.042
- Good morning.
- Hi.

02:59.375 --> 03:02.292
- Good morning, Odin.
- Have you slept well?

03:02.458 --> 03:05.708
There's coffee on the thermos,
if you want.

03:05.875 --> 03:08.875
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

03:10.042 --> 03:12.625
- Done
- Are you done?

03:12.792 --> 03:16.125
- Where is it?
- I don't know. You'll have to look.

03:16.292 --> 03:22.875
This is not the day for a treasure hunt.
Check the basement, ok?

03:23.042 --> 03:27.542
- Where is what?
- A radiocontrolled car.

03:32.375 --> 03:34.250
What?

03:36.875 --> 03:39.958
- Everything ok?
- Yeah.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.917
- Want eggs?
- Yeah.

04:06.292 --> 04:11.083
You won't make it under
30 seconds.

04:11.250 --> 04:16.667
If I can't, you can control the music
in the car for a month.

04:16.833 --> 04:19.458
- Agreed.
- Hell no. A week.

04:19.625 --> 04:23.458
Two weeks. Then you for a month. Two weeks.

04:23.625 --> 04:26.958
- Two weeks.
- Yes.

04:34.042 --> 04:38.708
Are you ready? Three, two, one, go.

04:47.083 --> 04:49.750
Five seconds.

04:57.542 --> 04:59.042
Ten.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.042
Cross.

05:09.542 --> 05:12.333
- Twenty.
- Halfway.

05:19.542 --> 05:24.167
- Fuck! Damn it!
— 27, 28, 29, 30.

05:36.375 --> 05:40.458
What's your thoughts on a manual
reset at 1000 meters?

05:40.625 --> 05:43.333
- You raising?
- Ok, are you giving up?

05:43.500 --> 05:47.708
I don't give up.
I'll make it next time.

05:49.708 --> 05:53.750
- Good evening, guys.
- Hello.

05:59.333 --> 06:03.375
- Who's coming to the barbeque?
- Oil people.

06:03.542 --> 06:07.083
Nice people. It'll be fun.

06:07.250 --> 06:11.375
- What have you got in the bag? It's heavy.
- It's not heavy.

06:11.542 --> 06:16.542
- It weighs 15 kilos.
- You've got gamer arms. No muscles.

06:16.708 --> 06:20.833
- Why don't you just move in?
- I'm not gonna move in.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.917
- You've been together for a year now.
- No, it's been nine months.

06:27.083 --> 06:30.667
- A lot of people move in together that quick.
- Not me.

06:30.833 --> 06:34.167
You move in,
buy a minivan, -

06:34.333 --> 06:37.542
- and then I have to sit alone
programming in the office.

06:37.708 --> 06:43.000
- That won't happen.
- So no tiny electric car.

06:43.167 --> 06:47.042
I've got my life, and he's got
his. It's working out well.

06:53.667 --> 06:57.000
- Hello.
- Hi, Oddvar. New regimen?

07:03.708 --> 07:06.917
Don't leave me standing here
by myself, then.

07:10.625 --> 07:13.125
Shall I take it?

07:15.667 --> 07:18.708
- Hi, Arthur.
- Hi.

07:18.875 --> 07:23.750
- Ski jumping is my hobby.
- <i>Watching</i> ski jumping is your hobby.

07:25.417 --> 07:29.542
Hi, Odin. Auntie get a hug?
Please.

07:29.708 --> 07:33.500
Give auntie Vibeke a hug.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.667
— Hi.
— Hi.

07:38.125 --> 07:42.292
Look. I'm going to get more beer.

07:49.917 --> 07:52.958
— Hi.
— Hi.

08:01.708 --> 08:08.167
Right. Smart sending you two to
fetch beer. Just go on.

08:08.333 --> 08:12.208
- There. Enjoy.
- Thanks.

08:15.500 --> 08:19.417
Come on, we'll look after you. Hi!

08:23.250 --> 08:25.875
No! Get lost!

08:32.708 --> 08:36.583
- Nightynight, Odin.
- Time for bed.

08:39.167 --> 08:42.167
Good, Arthur! Come!

09:09.792 --> 09:12.375
Is it the skinnydipper?

09:14.833 --> 09:18.208
- Oh no.
- You don't look too good.

09:18.375 --> 09:21.917
- I'm so sick. Aren't you?
- Not very.

09:22.083 --> 09:26.042
Stian had made breakfast.
Egg and bacon.

09:28.042 --> 09:31.958
- Do you want this one?
- Oh, thanks.

09:32.125 --> 09:36.458
That bag isn't so bad, is it?

09:36.625 --> 09:42.000
Does it have everything? Does it have a Cola
and a Whopper Cheeseburger then?

09:42.167 --> 09:44.250
Hello?

09:45.542 --> 09:48.500
No, we're at work.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.417
What?

09:57.875 --> 10:01.417
Yeah, but we'll come right away.

10:04.625 --> 10:07.375
Saga called.
There's been an accident.

10:07.542 --> 10:12.792
- We're headed out to the heliport now.
- What kind of accident?

10:30.625 --> 10:33.167
Take the other softbag.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.667
- Was that all of it?
- Yes.

10:54.708 --> 10:58.417
Hi. I'm William Lie.

10:58.583 --> 11:02.917
— Sofia Hartman.
- I'm duty manager.

11:03.083 --> 11:06.625
- Hi. William Lie.
— Arthur.

11:06.792 --> 11:11.292
- What's happened? Where are we going?
- First you will need to sign this.

11:11.458 --> 11:15.125
- What is it?
— Non-Disclosure.

11:15.292 --> 11:18.958
Yes, it is a non-disclosure agreement.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.917
Then we are a bit short on time.

11:26.542 --> 11:29.583
Thank you very much. Thank you.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.750
You didn't answer me. What are we doing?

11:32.917 --> 11:37.125
Normand Maximus is waiting for you.
I'll contact you when you're out there.

11:37.292 --> 11:40.875
We have a representative on board.

13:20.542 --> 13:25.083
- Have they arrived?
- They are situated and ready.

13:25.250 --> 13:29.458
- Berit, are we connected?
- On monitor now.

13:29.625 --> 13:33.333
Jasin, can you get the ship on the speaker?

13:40.792 --> 13:44.958
- Hi. That's us done on deck.
- They have arrived.

13:50.708 --> 13:54.625
Sofia, it is Berit.
Can you hear me?

13:54.792 --> 13:58.458
I have William Lie here.
You're on speaker.

13:58.625 --> 14:03.167
Listen. What has happened,
is that a rig has sunk.

14:03.333 --> 14:08.375
Probably because of a
local subsidence.

14:08.542 --> 14:12.500
Wasn't Ekofisk only about
a couple of centimeters a year?

14:12.667 --> 14:17.458
This time the subsidence occurred
directly below the platform base.

14:17.625 --> 14:21.833
We have sent you some blueprints.
Have you received them?

14:24.792 --> 14:28.917
- We received them, yes.
- Can you navigate by them?

14:29.083 --> 14:33.625
- That depends on what we're looking for?
- People that are missing.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.375
When a large construction
sinks that quickly, -

14:38.542 --> 14:42.458
- we expect there to be air pockets.
We have to find out if anybody is alive.

14:44.792 --> 14:49.958
- So we are looking for people?
- That is correct

14:50.125 --> 14:56.000
We hope that the robot can get into the
construction to look for survivors.

15:00.208 --> 15:03.542
- We'll try.
- Thank you.

15:13.625 --> 15:16.708
Control to crane.
We are shortly ready for release.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.750
Acknowledged.

15:26.833 --> 15:27.542
Online.

15:31.792 --> 15:36.458
Are we ready? Release in three, two, one.

16:05.042 --> 16:07.792
- Will you record?
- Yes. It's recording already.

16:07.958 --> 16:10.375
Activate the mike too.

16:21.042 --> 16:23.542
Heading 45

16:55.708 --> 17:01.000
- I'm trying to find a way in here.
- 4 and 45 degrees.

17:01.167 --> 17:05.042
- And 120. Where do you wanna go?
- Follow the pipes in.

17:13.375 --> 17:18.417
- Can you see an opening?
- There's a channel coming up starboard.

17:34.583 --> 17:36.542
75 meters.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.625
There's a door here.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.000
Are you able to open it?

17:59.917 --> 18:02.000
We'll try.

18:03.042 --> 18:05.625
We can try.

18:52.375 --> 18:58.625
- Jasin, do you have an ID?
- I'm on it. Sending now.

18:59.625 --> 19:02.125
Proceeding.

19:49.458 --> 19:51.792
- Now what?
- Stay your heading.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.583
Two seconds.

20:07.667 --> 20:10.583
We've got another deceased.

20:28.083 --> 20:32.042
- Did you hear that?
- I hear it.

20:49.083 --> 20:51.208
He's alive.

20:51.375 --> 20:56.000
- Let them know one person is alive.
- Duty to control.

20:56.167 --> 20:59.875
We have one person alive
in an air pocket.

21:13.542 --> 21:17.458
- Berit.
- Jasin, contact the standby boat.

21:17.625 --> 21:21.750
- Ask them what they want us to do?
- Control to duty.

21:21.917 --> 21:23.042
Hello?

21:23.208 --> 21:26.250
Help! Help!

21:27.417 --> 21:30.833
Hello? I'm alive!

21:31.583 --> 21:36.875
- Get me out of here! Help!
- They have to tell us what to do.

21:37.042 --> 21:41.667
We have disturbances on the sonar.
What is it?

21:46.833 --> 21:48.500
What is that sound?

21:57.500 --> 22:00.500
Is there a leak? Berit?

22:00.667 --> 22:04.708
We have shut all valves.
It's not on our end.

22:07.250 --> 22:09.792
— Help!
- What is it?

22:14.250 --> 22:18.292
- Turn the audio off.
- Get me out of here!

22:32.333 --> 22:36.833
- It's leaking gas! Get Eelie out!
— Sofia?

22:39.833 --> 22:41.542
What should I do with this one then?

23:03.958 --> 23:07.875
The rig is leaking gas!
You need to get the boat away!

23:11.125 --> 23:12.208
Come on, you have to...

23:35.208 --> 23:41.583
Eight people have been confirmed dead.
Our thoughts are with their friends and families.

23:41.750 --> 23:44.917
A rescue operation is
still ongoing.

23:45.083 --> 23:51.958
We will return later with
further updates. Thank you.

23:52.125 --> 23:56.083
That was secretary of oil and energy,
Steinar Skagemo...

23:56.250 --> 24:02.000
- Where are you?
- In a corridor. Sixth floor.

24:09.958 --> 24:13.583
— Hi.
— Hi.

24:13.750 --> 24:18.625
- Hi. Oh my god. Are you ok?
— Mm.

24:26.208 --> 24:31.333
- God. What happened?
- I'm ok.

24:39.292 --> 24:41.792
Come here.

24:44.833 --> 24:47.167
Hey...

24:52.167 --> 24:54.667
What happened?

24:59.917 --> 25:03.208
It was so god damn awful.

25:15.625 --> 25:20.958
- Can I stay with you a few days?
- Of course.

25:21.125 --> 25:26.875
- Isn't so great being alone...
- You can stay with me for as long as you like.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.708
Mm?

25:35.417 --> 25:38.833
Let's go home. Ok?

25:59.917 --> 26:03.375
- We've run a simulation.
- Ok?

26:06.792 --> 26:11.167
The rig sunk in two minutes
and 47 seconds.

26:16.833 --> 26:20.792
It simply can't have been a subsidence.

26:20.958 --> 26:23.042
Oh my god.

27:42.542 --> 27:46.667
- I couldn't find anybody to take the shift.
- That's ok.

27:50.667 --> 27:56.000
- I've got your miniature here.
- Yep, that you do.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.083
Hey...

28:03.667 --> 28:05.958
- Hey...

28:06.125 --> 28:10.125
- I love you.
- I love you too.

28:12.750 --> 28:15.417
- Ok.
— Ok.

28:15.583 --> 28:19.708
Odin, I'm leaving now.
If you're saying goodbye, now's the time.

28:26.167 --> 28:29.375
- Can daddy get a hug? Bye!
- Bye.

28:33.500 --> 28:36.667
- Bye.
- Bye. Have a good trip!

28:37.917 --> 28:42.417
- Shall we go fix the car?
- Yeah.

28:42.583 --> 28:45.000
It will be good.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.667
Do you see that tiny screw?
If you just tighten it a little bit.

29:00.375 --> 29:03.875
— Hey, Arthur.
- You have to get out here.

29:04.042 --> 29:06.083
Ok. What's up?

29:29.792 --> 29:32.333
— Hello.
— Hello.

29:32.500 --> 29:36.875
- Did you get reading glasses?
- Shut up.

29:37.042 --> 29:41.542
- How did it go with Sofia?
- Everything was fine.

29:41.708 --> 29:47.000
- They mentioned a gas explosion?
- Yeah, a leak from a well.

29:47.167 --> 29:50.750
- A well?
- That's what they're saying

29:50.917 --> 29:56.708
So I don't know.
She's fine. She's tough.

29:57.750 --> 30:00.333
- Good.
- How is everybody doing?

30:00.500 --> 30:07.583
People talk a bit. A bit shaky,
but everything's ok. Of course it is.

30:07.750 --> 30:14.458
- Good. I'll have to make my rounds.
- Ok.

30:20.125 --> 30:25.125
- What is up with you?
- Me? Nothing.

30:25.292 --> 30:30.292
- Of course there is. I can tell.
- I'm looking forward to the rounds.

30:30.458 --> 30:32.958
What is that?

30:34.125 --> 30:38.708
- What?
- Sofia and I had a chat.

30:41.167 --> 30:46.250
- She's moving in with me and Odin.
- Really? That's great.

30:46.417 --> 30:49.250
- Yeah.
- You deserve it.

30:49.417 --> 30:54.208
- A new start.
- Yeah, damn, it's a new start.

31:00.875 --> 31:05.250
I was able to retrieve the recording
from after the explosion..

31:05.417 --> 31:09.083
This is from the frontal camera.
What we saw.

31:09.250 --> 31:13.833
But if I swap to the rear camera...

31:18.167 --> 31:20.583
What? Rewind.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.583
That's no damn well leak.

31:31.750 --> 31:34.292
It just keeps going.

31:47.667 --> 31:50.042
- We'll just wait here.
- Yeah.

32:04.583 --> 32:08.333
- Sorry? Lie?
- Yeah, ok.

32:12.125 --> 32:14.208
— Hi.
— Hi.

32:14.375 --> 32:19.958
I haven't had a break the past 12 hours.
Can we talk while I eat?

32:29.417 --> 32:32.875
It's not a well leak.

32:33.042 --> 32:37.042
It is not rare to see migrating
gass in the North Sea.

32:37.208 --> 32:40.250
The entire area exploded.

32:40.417 --> 32:45.750
When that much gass surfaces at once,
there's something seriously wrong.

32:45.917 --> 32:49.667
And that there can simply not
have been a subsidence.

32:54.333 --> 32:59.250
Perhaps we should let other professionals
than ourselves be the judge of that.

33:00.833 --> 33:05.333
- Can I borrow that?
- Sure.

33:07.917 --> 33:11.083
Thank you very much.

33:14.625 --> 33:17.625
Are you leaving?

33:17.792 --> 33:23.625
There are thousands working out there
who has a right to know what's going on.

33:27.167 --> 33:30.208
You've got to say something.

33:30.375 --> 33:35.125
Remember you signed a
non-disclosure agreement.

33:44.500 --> 33:49.583
- What did they say?
- Er, I don't know.

33:49.750 --> 33:54.000
- Did you show them the clip?
- I showed William Lie.

33:54.167 --> 33:57.625
- And what did he say, then?
- Not a whole lot.

33:57.792 --> 34:01.958
- He just took the disk and left.
- Ok.

34:02.125 --> 34:09.000
That's good I guess. They're looking
into it and deciding what to do.

34:09.167 --> 34:11.042
Mm.

34:28.417 --> 34:32.875
- Is the pressure ok?
- It was unstable but fine now.

34:33.042 --> 34:39.583
It indicated differential sticking,
and we might have a dogleg.

34:58.667 --> 35:00.667
Hi, Gunn.

35:12.333 --> 35:18.000
- Secretary of Oil and Energy Skagemo.
- Good morning. Steinar Skagemo.

35:21.917 --> 35:25.667
Thank you for coming here
on such short notice.

35:25.833 --> 35:32.875
There has been a dramatic development
the last couple of days. William.

35:33.042 --> 35:37.833
The number of fractures and
slides has risen.

35:38.875 --> 35:42.583
The platform that sank has been
looked into.

35:42.750 --> 35:47.292
We have received video that
shows a fracture that's larger -

35:47.458 --> 35:50.583
- than we've ever seen before.

35:50.750 --> 35:55.000
A lot larger. If you look here...

35:56.417 --> 36:01.083
If this is the middle of the fracture,
where the extension is greatest, -

36:01.250 --> 36:06.708
- this means that we're talking about
a tear that is several kilometers wide.

36:06.875 --> 36:12.750
- Perhaps several miles
- Where is this tear originating?

36:14.125 --> 36:16.000
Oddvar?

36:21.458 --> 36:27.167
These are the platforms in the North Sea.
This is Storegga.

36:27.333 --> 36:32.000
About 8000 years ago this was the site of
a gigantic slide, the Storegga slide.

36:32.167 --> 36:37.458
5000 cubic kilometers of rock,
mud and sand displaced.

36:37.625 --> 36:43.708
The slides we've now registered
are directly in line with Storegga.

36:43.875 --> 36:45.792
And?

36:45.958 --> 36:50.208
We have long believed that
it was a local subsidence.

36:50.375 --> 36:55.958
We no longer believe that.
If you will review this video...

37:10.667 --> 37:15.542
- What are we looking at?
- A part of a larger slide.

37:15.708 --> 37:19.875
Looking here, you can
see the sea-bed disappearing.

37:22.583 --> 37:28.875
The Storegga slide.
It has started moving again.

37:29.042 --> 37:34.250
- What kind of magnitude are we talking?
- Unfortunately hard to say.

37:34.417 --> 37:39.292
But it could become greater than
anything recorded in modern times.

37:43.333 --> 37:48.042
- In an area packed with oil rigs?
- And people, yeah.

37:49.250 --> 37:52.625
- Why is this happening now?
- We don't know.

37:52.792 --> 37:58.583
Could be a lot of reasons.
Climate changes or other factors.

37:58.750 --> 38:03.792
Could even be that we
caused this ourselves.

38:03.958 --> 38:08.750
- What is that supposed to mean?
- We have drilled thousands of wells.

38:08.917 --> 38:13.417
Drained enormous oil- and
gas reservoirs below the seabed.

38:13.583 --> 38:16.458
Punched a lot of holes
in that swiss cheese.

38:16.625 --> 38:22.292
- Let's consider the situation we are facing.
- We'd love to. What do you suggest?

38:25.042 --> 38:28.000
Stop all work in the area.

38:28.167 --> 38:32.500
Close and secure all wells
until we know more.

38:49.667 --> 38:54.583
If we can't close the wells,
what will happen?

38:54.750 --> 38:57.292
Look, Skagemo.

38:58.583 --> 39:02.083
That is the casing.
It is a sort of holster.

39:02.250 --> 39:06.917
It's secured in the seabed,
and the drill goes into it.

39:08.750 --> 39:14.292
If the rig capsizes
and pulls the drill out like this, -

39:14.458 --> 39:18.000
- the oil will be freely flowing.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.208
But what kind of magnitude would the spill be?

39:23.375 --> 39:27.042
- Do you remember Deepwater Horizon?
- Yes.

39:27.208 --> 39:33.083
That was the size of Denmark, and
that was one well. Here there are 350.

39:56.458 --> 39:59.917
We are facing an enormous task.

40:00.083 --> 40:04.625
Nobody have experienced something similar.
Nobody have practiced something similar.

40:04.792 --> 40:08.083
The Joint Rescue Centre
will coordinate all evacuation, -

40:08.250 --> 40:13.542
- and it is our task to secure
and shut down half the North Sea.

40:18.333 --> 40:21.833
In order to be able to do this, -

40:22.000 --> 40:26.375
- closing down all wells
and secure all installations, -

40:26.542 --> 40:29.458
- demands that everybody
do their very best.

40:31.458 --> 40:37.250
We are short on time, but no
panic. Safety is foremost.

40:37.417 --> 40:43.458
All platforms that are on the red list,
should be secured and closed down.

40:43.625 --> 40:46.500
- What's happening?
- I don't know any more than you.

40:46.667 --> 40:51.792
There's a lot of people evacuating.
Renate, would you check that?

40:54.792 --> 41:00.458
I haven't received any more information,
but we'll handle it nice and slowly.

41:00.625 --> 41:05.833
Who owns that belt?
Ok, put it in one of the boxes.

41:09.958 --> 41:15.708
Which remain?
Status of Statfjord A?

41:15.875 --> 41:22.125
- Starting shutdown of Statfjord A.
- That is good.

41:25.417 --> 41:30.458
Ok. Good. And Oseberg?

41:30.625 --> 41:35.708
Oseberg A and D are secure.
B is almost done.

41:37.292 --> 41:40.958
All crew has been shuttled to
Normand Vision and on to Ågotnes.

41:41.125 --> 41:45.667
Get ready, group A.
Kjell Are Heiland? Terje Hamar?

41:45.833 --> 41:49.500
Henning Sirnes?
And Eva Fjørtoft?

41:49.667 --> 41:54.458
- Good. Follow Renate up on deck.
- Come along.

41:54.625 --> 41:58.000
Find out who it is, and
send the information to me.

42:20.625 --> 42:24.833
- Valve at Troll, any solution?
- Troll A? It is green.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.500
Troll is closed.

42:28.417 --> 42:34.417
- Moving on down the list.
- All of Statfjord is green.

43:00.250 --> 43:05.125
This is P4 news with a news broadcast.
Unconfirmed sources report of -

43:05.292 --> 43:10.042
- a major evacuation from
oil rigs in the North Sea.

43:10.208 --> 43:14.042
We have not received any
confirmation from the industry.

43:14.208 --> 43:20.917
Over to the Joint Rescue Centre
at Sola. Major activity is taking place.

43:21.083 --> 43:28.292
All emergency services; ambulance,
police and fire rescue is on site.

43:28.458 --> 43:33.875
We can conclude that
evacuation protocols -

43:34.042 --> 43:40.417
- and cooperation between departments
is working satisfactory.

43:40.583 --> 43:47.125
The operation is of a magnitude we have
not previously seen domestically.

43:47.292 --> 43:51.417
There are still error reports
at one of the wells at Gullfaks A.

43:51.583 --> 43:57.708
- It's not just a bit delayed?
- There's something off with the connection.

43:57.875 --> 44:02.333
Call the platform manager.
It's Helseth, isn't it?

44:02.500 --> 44:06.875
Ok, that's us. Group F.
We're getting the lights.

44:07.042 --> 44:09.708
Ready?

44:10.750 --> 44:13.583
Ronny Helseth.

44:13.750 --> 44:17.333
Seriously? We're in the middle of an evacuation.

44:22.542 --> 44:26.625
Ok, I'll see what I can do.

44:26.792 --> 44:32.458
They can't reach well number 4.
They can't shut it off remotely.

44:32.625 --> 44:37.625
We can't leave before it is shut.
We were pumping at 100% all night.

44:37.792 --> 44:43.750
- I'm headed down to fix it manually.
- Now? You have to look after this group.

44:46.583 --> 44:48.875
I'm going down.

44:50.083 --> 44:55.750
- I'll go down the D-shaft.
- Ok, but hurry.

44:55.917 --> 44:59.125
- Hold the bus, will you.
- Yeah.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.458
About 4.30 the crew started
evacuating.

45:44.625 --> 45:50.667
A little more than 150 on board.
Smooth...

45:50.833 --> 45:54.625
The subscriber you are trying
to reach is unavailable.

45:54.792 --> 45:58.875
- Status of Gjøa?
- Working on the last wells.

45:59.042 --> 46:04.583
- What about the valve at Gullfaks?
- It will take a while to get all the way down.

46:15.583 --> 46:20.083
- Stian, the bus has arrived.
- Acknowledged. Almost down.

47:13.333 --> 47:17.417
What the hell? Shit!

47:17.583 --> 47:21.375
- We have lost the connection.
- With who?

47:21.542 --> 47:25.792
With the entire rig. Everything's down.

47:31.292 --> 47:34.375
It isn't the only one.

47:34.542 --> 47:38.250
It isn't the only one.
Are, is it down on your end?

47:44.542 --> 47:48.083
- Stian, it's time. Leaving.
- Acknowledged.

47:48.250 --> 47:51.000
I'm shutting off the valve now.

48:53.917 --> 48:56.000
Come on! In!

49:12.708 --> 49:15.375
Stian, come on!

49:16.583 --> 49:19.042
Come on! In!

49:35.292 --> 49:37.167
Come on!

50:18.750 --> 50:24.000
You have reached Berit Djuphagen.
Leave a message.

50:24.167 --> 50:28.292
This is Sofia Hartman.
I've been trying to reach you.

50:28.458 --> 50:33.958
I'm on my way out to you.
I'll message you when I'm there.

50:40.167 --> 50:44.542
- We're here to see Berit Djuphagen.
- You have an appointment?

50:49.042 --> 50:52.250
We can talk in here.

50:58.875 --> 51:02.458
- Odin, won't you sit?
- Yeah.

51:07.042 --> 51:11.167
- I can't reach Stian.
— Sofia...

51:14.208 --> 51:18.542
We couldn't close all the wells
at Gullfaks remotely, -

51:18.708 --> 51:24.042
- So Stian was sent down
to close them manually.

51:25.083 --> 51:31.583
I talked with Ronny now,
and they didn't...

51:32.625 --> 51:35.792
Stian was never evacuated.

51:35.958 --> 51:40.000
He sent me a message saying
he would be evacuated.

51:40.167 --> 51:43.500
More than 30 platforms
have collapsed.

51:43.667 --> 51:48.333
Gullfaks was one of the first who were
hit, and a leg was torn off.

51:48.500 --> 51:51.000
Stian was down there.

51:54.458 --> 51:59.667
I have to get an overview over
the lifeboats that are still out there.

51:59.833 --> 52:03.042
Stian Birkeland
is still out on Gullfaks A.

52:03.208 --> 52:09.167
- You have to get somebody out there to pick him up.
- That there is Gullfaks A.

52:09.333 --> 52:13.583
It has status red. It has lost a leg
and is standing at the edge of a slide.

52:13.750 --> 52:17.250
It can at any point tip over
and sink. I am sorry.

52:17.417 --> 52:22.708
But you sent him down there.
So you have to get him back up.

52:23.917 --> 52:27.708
I have to ask you to leave.

52:27.875 --> 52:30.333
No.

52:30.500 --> 52:35.542
No, I am not going anywhere
until you have retrieved him!

52:35.708 --> 52:41.625
I can't send out an emergency crew
who will also risk losing their lives.

52:41.792 --> 52:47.000
Outside there is a little boy who
is going to lose his father.

52:47.167 --> 52:50.917
- Would you get the guard?
- Aren't you gonna do anything?

52:51.083 --> 52:55.000
Huh? Perhaps you should go out
there and tell that little boy -

52:55.167 --> 53:00.208
- that none of you will do
anything to save his father.

53:00.375 --> 53:03.125
I won't do it.

53:04.125 --> 53:06.667
Sofia.

53:14.417 --> 53:16.167
No.

53:16.333 --> 53:19.042
How is that link going?

53:33.208 --> 53:36.542
Did anything happen to daddy?

53:42.708 --> 53:45.042
Yes.

53:46.500 --> 53:49.000
In a way.

54:05.500 --> 54:08.750
- Would you wait here a little?
— Yeah.

54:08.917 --> 54:11.583
Ok. See you soon.

54:12.458 --> 54:16.583
You have cameras everywhere
on the platforms?

54:16.750 --> 54:20.333
- Yes, in most rooms.
- Show me the images.

54:20.500 --> 54:24.208
— Sofia.
- I will see them. Now.

54:41.333 --> 54:46.917
We don't have cameras in all
technical rooms. I'll fast forward.

55:06.917 --> 55:10.875
— No!
— Sofia ...

55:18.667 --> 55:23.000
He wrote to me that
he would be evacuated.

55:29.708 --> 55:32.083
Berit?

55:32.250 --> 55:34.583
Look at this.

55:36.417 --> 55:38.458
Huh?

55:38.625 --> 55:42.917
There's a hatch in to a
service shaft that's been opened.

55:43.708 --> 55:46.708
What does that mean?

55:46.875 --> 55:52.792
Most likely it was torn up
when the platform got hit.

55:55.333 --> 56:02.000
- Could Stian have opened it?
- It is unlikely...

56:04.125 --> 56:08.583
- Look out for Odin.
— Sofia?

56:11.958 --> 56:15.667
Hi, Vibeke. It's Sofia.
You have to help me.

56:43.417 --> 56:46.583
- I just need the mini.
- Ok.

56:49.375 --> 56:53.333
- Where do you think he is?
- There are passages between the legs.

56:53.500 --> 56:59.875
- Stian's sister will fly me out there.
- Honestly, Sofia. Is this legal?

57:02.250 --> 57:05.250
- You both have suits?
- It's just me.

57:05.417 --> 57:10.667
- Officially we're on another mission.
— Sofia?

57:10.833 --> 57:15.750
- What should I do?
- You should not go alone, at least.

57:59.417 --> 58:03.333
Over there is Gullfaks Alfa.

58:03.500 --> 58:08.292
The deck is gone,
so we have to lower you down.

58:08.458 --> 58:13.375
I'll go first, then the gear,
then I'll help you.

58:13.542 --> 58:17.292
Arthur, it's ok. Don't look down.
Keep looking straight ahead.

58:17.458 --> 58:20.958
- Get ready, and be out quick.
- Yeah.

58:21.125 --> 58:25.125
We have to continue, before
anybody find out we're here

58:25.292 --> 58:28.667
Just find Stian, ok?
Find my brother.

58:28.833 --> 58:31.500
Arthur, it is ok.

59:49.083 --> 59:52.125
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

1:00:12.625 --> 1:00:14.500
Ok?

1:00:20.917 --> 1:00:22.958
It's here.

1:00:26.667 --> 1:00:29.000
Ok.

1:00:32.875 --> 1:00:37.000
- We've got to be here. Don't you think?
- Yeah.

1:00:38.083 --> 1:00:42.458
- There. We'll start the search there.
- Ok. Wait a little.

1:00:43.417 --> 1:00:45.833
- Come on!
— Ok.

1:00:58.250 --> 1:01:01.667
And Sofia went out there?

1:01:01.833 --> 1:01:05.375
They wouldn't send anybody out.

1:01:06.542 --> 1:01:10.167
They didn't want to risk anymore lives.

1:01:10.333 --> 1:01:14.500
- So she just left.
— Mm.

1:01:35.042 --> 1:01:37.208
— Hello, Odin.
— Hello.

1:01:37.375 --> 1:01:40.500
- How are you doing?
- Good.

1:01:42.500 --> 1:01:45.042
Can I have a hug?

1:01:47.417 --> 1:01:49.208
Hi.

1:01:55.458 --> 1:01:58.292
We're going down there.

1:02:59.583 --> 1:03:03.083
- We have to drop it.
- Can it take it, then?

1:03:03.250 --> 1:03:05.917
It has to.

1:03:09.833 --> 1:03:11.792
Ready?

1:03:13.708 --> 1:03:17.167
Three, two... one.

1:03:28.083 --> 1:03:29.708
NO CONNECTION

1:03:48.750 --> 1:03:53.208
We're up.
Looks like everything's working.

1:04:50.792 --> 1:04:53.708
Turn on the thermal camera.

1:05:29.042 --> 1:05:32.333
I'll go in between the pipes here.

1:06:22.458 --> 1:06:25.083
He's alive!

1:06:45.167 --> 1:06:47.250
Oddvar.

1:06:51.833 --> 1:06:56.958
- It's not possible.
- The images are ten minutes old.

1:07:24.958 --> 1:07:28.958
The slide has torn up all
of our seabed installations.

1:07:29.125 --> 1:07:32.958
The black here is spillage.

1:07:33.125 --> 1:07:39.625
And the wind direction is unfavorable.
The oil is headed towards the coast.

1:07:42.792 --> 1:07:45.625
How much?

1:07:45.792 --> 1:07:52.750
About 100000 square kilometers,
but it is still expanding.

1:07:55.708 --> 1:07:58.833
Gunn, what's the worst case scenario?

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:03.792
The entire western coastline
will be severely harmed.

1:08:03.958 --> 1:08:09.208
All the way from Molde, Ålesund, Bergen
Haugesund, Stavanger.

1:08:09.375 --> 1:08:13.583
Every fjord, every single little nook.

1:08:15.375 --> 1:08:18.667
Birds, fish.

1:08:18.833 --> 1:08:21.333
All animal life, nature.

1:08:21.500 --> 1:08:26.208
The fish farming industry will be destroyed.
All fishing, and tourism.

1:08:26.375 --> 1:08:33.000
It will take decades to recover.
Perhaps hundreds of years.

1:08:35.292 --> 1:08:39.125
And then it will move
further south -

1:08:39.292 --> 1:08:44.000
— towards Danmark, Tyskland, Nederland,
large parts of Great Britain.

1:08:44.167 --> 1:08:47.292
It will expand...

1:08:50.708 --> 1:08:55.417
But what can we do to
limit the impact?

1:08:55.583 --> 1:09:01.875
We've contacted NOFO, coastal services,
navy and local authorities.

1:09:02.042 --> 1:09:09.583
Everybody are on alert, but nobody
are sized for something like this.

1:09:15.167 --> 1:09:17.792
How much time do we have?

1:09:17.958 --> 1:09:24.583
It won't reach land before tomorrow
evening, but when it does...

1:09:26.542 --> 1:09:29.458
We have a chance.

1:09:30.708 --> 1:09:34.583
But then we have to decide now.

1:09:34.750 --> 1:09:40.958
It has never been done at such a scale,
but right now the spill is compressed.

1:09:41.125 --> 1:09:45.583
And the film is thick enough, for now.

1:09:49.750 --> 1:09:52.792
Thick enough for what?

1:09:54.125 --> 1:09:57.500
To light it on fire.

1:10:05.083 --> 1:10:10.708
It is way too large for an in-situ
burning. And the environmental impact...

1:10:10.875 --> 1:10:16.125
The consequences will be less regardless
than what you're outlining now.

1:10:22.458 --> 1:10:26.250
That is not a decision I can make.

1:10:31.958 --> 1:10:34.042
It's here.

1:11:12.167 --> 1:11:15.500
- It's supposed to be here.
- Which one?

1:11:15.667 --> 1:11:18.083
E601B, there.

1:11:26.667 --> 1:11:28.708
Stian?

1:11:28.875 --> 1:11:30.750
Stian?

1:11:45.375 --> 1:11:47.083
Stian?

1:11:47.250 --> 1:11:49.500
Stian?

1:12:04.542 --> 1:12:07.917
- Stian?
— Sofia?

1:12:09.500 --> 1:12:11.583
Sofia!

1:12:15.500 --> 1:12:19.625
— Hi.
- You're alive.

1:12:23.875 --> 1:12:27.125
- Can you get up here?
- No.

1:12:29.250 --> 1:12:33.000
- I need something to turn with!
- Yes.

1:12:33.167 --> 1:12:35.500
- Are you injured?
- Yes.

1:12:35.667 --> 1:12:39.208
- We have to get you up.
- Ok.

1:12:54.667 --> 1:12:59.417
- Can you find something?
- Yeah. Here.

1:13:01.125 --> 1:13:03.708
Sofia, we have to get out of here!

1:13:32.792 --> 1:13:35.917
Are you ok?

1:14:09.792 --> 1:14:14.208
I've talked to the prime minister
and the rest of the government.

1:14:17.208 --> 1:14:21.667
Let's do it. Light it up.

1:14:46.917 --> 1:14:50.333
You can connect here.

1:14:50.500 --> 1:14:54.625
- William, picture's up.
- Good.

1:15:45.875 --> 1:15:50.542
- Are you ok?
- I'll call Vibeke.

1:15:54.292 --> 1:15:55.958
Sofia?

1:16:20.208 --> 1:16:22.167
Ronny?

1:16:23.292 --> 1:16:26.833
They will ignite the spill.

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:30.583
- Is Gullfaks...
- It's smack in the middle.

1:16:30.750 --> 1:16:32.833
Wait here.

1:16:34.708 --> 1:16:37.833
- Which floor?
- Four.

1:17:05.667 --> 1:17:07.792
Stop!

1:17:18.292 --> 1:17:23.750
Stop! There're people out there!
Sofia Hartman went to Gullfaks A!

1:17:30.125 --> 1:17:32.042
What was that?

1:17:45.875 --> 1:17:48.375
There are people out there!

1:17:56.292 --> 1:17:58.083
Fuck.

1:17:59.292 --> 1:18:02.958
- She's not answering.
- Try duty.

1:18:12.208 --> 1:18:16.625
William? It's one Stian Birkeland.

1:18:26.917 --> 1:18:28.583
It is William Lie.

1:18:28.750 --> 1:18:34.292
It is Stian Birkeland. We are at
Gullfaks A. Somebody's got to get us.

1:18:36.208 --> 1:18:39.542
Birkeland, listen closely.

1:18:46.792 --> 1:18:48.917
What is it?

1:18:49.083 --> 1:18:53.583
Stian, what are they saying?
What is it?

1:18:54.792 --> 1:18:57.250
Stian?

1:18:57.417 --> 1:19:03.125
They have bombed the spillage.
It's on fire.

1:19:07.417 --> 1:19:11.083
It will be here in five minutes.

1:19:12.125 --> 1:19:15.083
They can't get us.

1:19:21.625 --> 1:19:24.250
Is his son here?

1:19:27.667 --> 1:19:29.125
Stian?

1:19:35.833 --> 1:19:38.792
Sofia, what do we do?

1:19:44.750 --> 1:19:46.708
Stian?

1:19:49.583 --> 1:19:51.667
Ok...

1:19:59.667 --> 1:20:03.750
Lifeboats. Are there lifeboats here?

1:20:03.917 --> 1:20:07.042
- Life boats!
- Down there.

1:20:09.083 --> 1:20:13.125
Ok, we have to get down.
Come! Arthur!

1:20:31.167 --> 1:20:33.708
I'll wait here.

1:20:33.875 --> 1:20:38.208
No. I think we have to... go now.

1:20:38.375 --> 1:20:41.917
Sofia told us to wait here.

1:20:44.958 --> 1:20:47.417
Ok.

1:21:14.208 --> 1:21:16.458
Sofia?

1:21:16.625 --> 1:21:20.125
- We have to fill it with water.
- What?

1:21:20.292 --> 1:21:22.792
Sofia, what do we do?

1:21:22.958 --> 1:21:27.125
We fill it with water,
so we get below the flames.

1:21:32.375 --> 1:21:35.792
Ok? Wait here.

1:21:46.292 --> 1:21:49.417
Sofia, take this.

1:21:53.458 --> 1:21:56.583
Arthur? Catch?

1:21:57.583 --> 1:22:01.125
Put it in the boat.
I'll get another.

1:22:11.458 --> 1:22:16.167
When it's filling with water,
you open both valves.

1:22:16.166 --> 1:22:21.917
When it's filling with water,
you open both valves.

1:22:56.750 --> 1:22:58.833
How much should I fill?

1:23:01.792 --> 1:23:03.500
Sofia!

1:23:10.083 --> 1:23:14.000
- How much?
- I don't know.

1:23:14.167 --> 1:23:17.208
Arthur, pull it up.

1:23:17.375 --> 1:23:20.125
- That?
- Yes. Up.

1:23:27.792 --> 1:23:30.125
A little bit more. A little bit more.

1:23:38.333 --> 1:23:40.375
Ok, that's enough!

1:23:47.292 --> 1:23:51.583
- Wait! It's stuck!
- It's stuck!

1:23:51.750 --> 1:23:55.042
- Come on!
- Wait!

1:24:04.083 --> 1:24:09.708
- Sofia? Are you ok?
- I'm ok. In!

1:24:20.083 --> 1:24:22.583
Strap in.

1:24:24.375 --> 1:24:27.750
- And now?
- Open the red screw.

1:24:27.917 --> 1:24:32.000
- This?
- Yes. Then pull the release.

1:24:34.042 --> 1:24:36.458
- Ok. Are you ready?
- Yes.

1:24:44.667 --> 1:24:48.083
- Nothing is happening.
- Pull again.

1:24:48.250 --> 1:24:50.583
- Come on!
- Fuck.

1:24:53.208 --> 1:24:57.083
- Arthur, did you pull the lever all the way up?
- Yes.

1:25:06.458 --> 1:25:09.125
One of them is down.

1:25:10.625 --> 1:25:13.375
- It has to be up.
- Ok.

1:25:13.542 --> 1:25:15.333
No, stop!

1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:19.792
It'll release at once.
You won't make it back.

1:25:36.167 --> 1:25:38.333
- No!
- No, Arthur!

1:25:38.500 --> 1:25:42.625
No, Arthur! Arthur, no!

1:25:44.417 --> 1:25:47.792
- No, come back!
— Arthur!

1:25:50.375 --> 1:25:52.542
No, sit down!

1:25:54.708 --> 1:25:56.375
Sit down!

1:26:29.375 --> 1:26:31.875
Stian!

1:26:32.792 --> 1:26:36.708
Stian. Stian ...

1:26:42.208 --> 1:26:44.500
Stian ...

1:27:08.292 --> 1:27:11.417
Stian, where's the pump? Stian!

1:27:23.750 --> 1:27:25.792
No!

1:27:57.917 --> 1:28:00.458
Ah!

1:28:51.500 --> 1:28:52.958
No!

1:31:12.875 --> 1:31:14.917
Stian.

1:31:19.083 --> 1:31:23.458
Pump... You have to keep pumping.

1:31:23.625 --> 1:31:29.333
I have tried.
It's not working. Sorry.

1:31:29.500 --> 1:31:32.917
Try opening the valve.

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:37.625
The black handle.

1:31:38.875 --> 1:31:41.333
The black handle.

1:32:41.792 --> 1:32:45.583
Yes! Stian!

1:33:10.917 --> 1:33:13.417
It's working.

1:34:01.708 --> 1:34:03.542
Hello?

1:34:04.833 --> 1:34:10.333
- Ronny speaking.
- Hi, Ronny. Stian here.

1:34:13.875 --> 1:34:17.250
Good to hear your voice.
Where are you?

1:34:17.417 --> 1:34:22.833
- In a lifeboat outside the rig.
- We're coming.

1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:25.708
- We'll be there right away.
- Ronny?

1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:29.042
Is Odin there?

1:34:29.208 --> 1:34:34.167
- Yes, hold on a moment. It's for you.
— Hello?

1:34:35.458 --> 1:34:38.500
Hi, Odin. It's daddy.

1:34:38.667 --> 1:34:42.333
Daddy! Are you ok?

1:34:42.500 --> 1:34:45.583
I'm ok.
Are you ok?

1:34:45.750 --> 1:34:47.625
Yeah.

1:34:49.083 --> 1:34:54.292
We're coming home now. Sofia too.

1:35:54.958 --> 1:35:57.208
Daddy!

1:37:23.042 --> 1:37:28.292
Nearly a full year passed before
the smoke was completely gone.

1:37:33.125 --> 1:37:39.208
Ten thousand billions in the bank
and then nature said enough.

1:37:41.958 --> 1:37:45.542
We thought we were an oil nation.

1:37:51.375 --> 1:37:54.833
But we are really an ocean nation.
