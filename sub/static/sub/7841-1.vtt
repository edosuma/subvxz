00:42.653 --> 00:44.483
My summer love.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.146
All right,

00:54.147 --> 00:55.798
next on my shoping list...

00:56.511 --> 00:58.700
a new phone.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.486
Attention, shoppers,

01:01.487 --> 01:03.516
iPhones now 20 cents.

01:03.517 --> 01:06.254
What happened to that mini-cell
phone I gave you, sir?

01:06.257 --> 01:09.240
Ooh, I thought that
was a lemon drop.

01:10.802 --> 01:13.076
I'll go get the
number de-listed.

01:18.221 --> 01:19.563
Well, well.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.006
What have we here?

01:23.729 --> 01:25.441
Why do I need another penny?

01:25.445 --> 01:26.813
I have billions.

01:26.816 --> 01:28.590
Still, if I don't take it,

01:28.595 --> 01:30.392
that hoodlum over there might.

01:32.666 --> 01:33.841
All right, penny,

01:33.855 --> 01:35.492
prepare to be pinched.

01:35.855 --> 01:37.931
Come to Papa.

01:40.756 --> 01:41.710
Help...

01:42.065 --> 01:42.932
me!

01:43.337 --> 01:43.723
Help...

01:43.896 --> 01:44.652
me!

01:45.035 --> 01:45.513
Help...

01:45.777 --> 01:46.563
me!

01:51.345 --> 01:53.162
I guess this is the end.

01:53.165 --> 01:56.130
I just wish I'd spent more
time at the office.

02:03.346 --> 02:05.640
Hey, you're not a penny.

02:05.648 --> 02:06.931
You saved my life

02:06.937 --> 02:08.910
There must be something I can do for you.

02:08.914 --> 02:10.252
A cookie. No, a car.

02:10.258 --> 02:10.982
No, a cookie.

02:11.135 --> 02:13.002
You're getting a free dinner.

02:13.408 --> 02:13.813
With...

02:13.816 --> 02:14.143
Yeah?

02:14.157 --> 02:14.913
...me.

02:14.918 --> 02:16.463
"Me"? But that's you.

02:16.467 --> 02:18.571
I'll pick you up
at 5:00 tomorrow.

02:18.578 --> 02:20.820
And I'll pick you up right now.

02:25.207 --> 02:25.840
Got it.

02:28.128 --> 02:29.530
See you at 5:00, then.

02:30.457 --> 02:32.120
Dinner with Mr. Burns.

02:32.128 --> 02:33.841
What a waste of my precious,

02:33.846 --> 02:35.562
precious Saturday night.

02:35.567 --> 02:37.392
Hey, Dad, have fun
with your boyfriend.

02:37.397 --> 02:39.690
He is not my boyfriend!

02:40.998 --> 02:42.102
So, Simpson,

02:42.108 --> 02:44.230
I hear you like pizza pie.

02:44.238 --> 02:45.091
I do.

02:45.097 --> 02:45.940
My favorite

02:45.958 --> 02:47.162
is Chicago deep-dish.

02:47.177 --> 02:48.291
Chicago, eh?

02:48.358 --> 02:50.590
Well, what if I took us there now?

02:50.597 --> 02:52.293
Drive to Chicago?

02:52.296 --> 02:53.602
I don't have time for that.

02:53.606 --> 02:55.410
I have to be back
at work on Monday,

02:55.418 --> 02:57.182
and my boss is a total jerk.

02:57.187 --> 02:59.511
Who said anything about drive?

02:59.915 --> 03:01.911
A p-p-p-private jet!

03:07.305 --> 03:09.382
Now would you care
for some sushi?

03:09.978 --> 03:12.723
yeah, but I'm
on a plane, idiot.

03:14.576 --> 03:16.172
My name is Svetlana,

03:16.175 --> 03:18.171
but you can call me "Hey, baby."

03:20.077 --> 03:22.082
And just so you know,

03:22.128 --> 03:24.710
she'll do anything for you.

03:24.718 --> 03:26.200
Anything except sex.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.812
And I do mean

03:28.005 --> 03:29.403
anything.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.260
I'm aroused...

03:32.267 --> 03:34.210
and confused.

03:34.218 --> 03:36.313
...Scratchy Show!

03:46.358 --> 03:47.481
Stewardess!

03:57.946 --> 03:59.323
Sorry, everyone.

03:59.327 --> 04:01.273
Air traffic control says we have

04:01.276 --> 04:04.432
to spend another three hours
on the tarmac.

04:08.337 --> 04:10.041
This is wonderful.

04:10.045 --> 04:12.082
Now, why don't you listen
to the musical stylings

04:12.087 --> 04:13.463
of Mr. Lionel Richie?

04:13.465 --> 04:14.482
Oh, my God,

04:14.488 --> 04:15.610
Lionel Richie!

04:15.615 --> 04:18.493
Can you sing "Say You Say Me,"
but make it about beer?

04:18.497 --> 04:19.680
Sure, I guess.

04:20.005 --> 04:21.380
Hey, you,

04:21.555 --> 04:23.100
beer me

04:23.225 --> 04:25.271
Beer me for always

04:25.307 --> 04:27.503
That's the way it should be

04:27.666 --> 04:29.102
Hey, you,

04:29.178 --> 04:30.760
beer me

04:30.896 --> 04:32.853
Beer us together

04:32.946 --> 04:34.472
naturally.

04:34.596 --> 04:36.912
Now make everyword "beer."

04:37.506 --> 04:39.242
Beer, beer

04:39.386 --> 04:41.280
Beer, beer

04:41.435 --> 04:43.900
Beer, beer,beer, beer, beer.

04:43.906 --> 04:46.380
Wait, I forgot the words.

04:54.255 --> 04:55.341
Love you.

04:56.997 --> 04:57.833
No!

04:57.837 --> 04:58.903
If I leave the plane,

04:58.907 --> 05:01.082
I'll be just like everyone else!

05:03.835 --> 05:06.441
Ground control, this is November 543 Charlie.

05:06.446 --> 05:08.171
We're going to need the extractor.

05:17.188 --> 05:18.230
No!

05:19.157 --> 05:20.102
Oh...

05:20.108 --> 05:22.071
I want to be back on the plane.

05:22.076 --> 05:24.002
We'll be back before you know it.

05:24.016 --> 05:24.993
Wha...

05:24.998 --> 05:27.093
Svetlana! Svetlana!

05:29.855 --> 05:30.622
Oh, hush.

05:30.627 --> 05:33.512
Now let's enjoy the Miami of Canada--

05:33.648 --> 05:34.710
Chicago!

05:35.247 --> 05:39.270
<i>My kind of town</i>

05:39.287 --> 05:41.723
<i>Chicago is</i>

05:42.437 --> 05:44.072
<i>One town</i>

05:44.075 --> 05:47.033
<i>That'll never, ever let you down</i>

05:47.208 --> 05:49.610
<i>It's my...</i>

05:49.657 --> 05:52.353
<i>Kind of town.</i>

05:52.406 --> 05:54.152
Okay, folks,for our first improv,

05:54.158 --> 05:55.820
we're going to need an occupation.

05:55.827 --> 05:56.713
Billionaire!

05:56.937 --> 05:58.680
Nice job-- where do I apply?

05:59.716 --> 06:01.202
Now I need a location.

06:01.216 --> 06:02.402
I came to relax.

06:02.407 --> 06:03.263
You think of it.

06:03.266 --> 06:05.141
I heard"a Starbucks...

06:05.145 --> 06:06.453
in Siberia."

06:06.455 --> 06:08.311
- Oh...
- Killer premise.

06:08.487 --> 06:09.881
Finally an emotion.

06:10.107 --> 06:10.673
Drunk!

06:11.358 --> 06:12.540
Okay, "drunk."

06:12.557 --> 06:15.020
And now we take you to a drunken billionaire

06:15.035 --> 06:17.493
at a Starbucks in Siberia.

06:20.157 --> 06:22.081
Uh, excuse me

06:22.258 --> 06:23.331
I need a,

06:23.385 --> 06:24.753
I need a coffee.

06:24.757 --> 06:27.263
Can you change
a billion-dollar bill?

06:27.267 --> 06:29.742
Our coffee costs a billion dollars.

06:29.748 --> 06:31.590
This is Starbucks.

06:32.048 --> 06:33.323
In Siberia.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.861
Why are you applauding them?

06:37.868 --> 06:38.872
We wrote it.

06:42.926 --> 06:45.742
While you were here,we felt like New York.

06:48.846 --> 06:51.080
I'm so happy!

07:00.512 --> 07:03.416
Homer, you smell like Chicago.

07:03.411 --> 07:05.773
Did you fly there on a commercial airline?

07:05.770 --> 07:08.666
No way. Commercial is for losers and terrorists.

07:08.679 --> 07:10.642
I flew on a private plane.

07:11.738 --> 07:13.920
Is it much different from a normal plane?

07:13.926 --> 07:16.020
Please, tell me you're joking.

07:16.027 --> 07:17.841
It's the difference between champagne

07:17.848 --> 07:19.382
and carbonated pee.

07:20.127 --> 07:21.541
Homie, what's wrong?

07:21.547 --> 07:23.391
I had it all for one night.

07:23.455 --> 07:24.891
Now for the rest of my life,

07:24.897 --> 07:26.111
I'll know what I'm missing,

07:26.125 --> 07:27.682
and all I have to remember it by

07:27.685 --> 07:29.373
is that my ears haven't popped.

07:29.398 --> 07:32.352
Well, I'll make sure that I never yawn again.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.162
Hey, Homer.

07:35.346 --> 07:36.053
D'oh!

07:43.535 --> 07:44.552
Hi, Dad.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.201
Hi.

07:45.425 --> 07:47.440
High like a private plane?

07:47.488 --> 07:50.340
The kind I'll never be invited to ride on again.

07:50.348 --> 07:52.963
That's where you're wrong, Homer.

07:53.506 --> 07:54.942
A fresh face!

07:54.945 --> 07:56.521
This is Colby Krause.

07:56.526 --> 07:59.153
I hired him to help you improve your life.

07:59.158 --> 08:02.060
He'll get you back on a private plane in no time.

08:02.157 --> 08:03.191
No way.

08:03.197 --> 08:05.590
I don't need any shrink,therapist,

08:05.595 --> 08:08.740
counselor, motivation all speaker or "guru."

08:08.775 --> 08:10.112
I'm a life coach.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.353
Oh, tell me more.

08:11.355 --> 08:13.350
The first step in self-improvement

08:13.355 --> 08:15.490
is to take a thorough look at your life.

08:15.498 --> 08:18.362
If you're gonna film me,
I insist on a body double.

08:18.576 --> 08:20.372
Is Uncle Fester still alive?

08:20.378 --> 08:21.591
The camera's not on yet, right?

08:21.596 --> 08:22.021
No.

08:22.025 --> 08:23.611
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

08:24.668 --> 08:25.561
Okay,

08:25.568 --> 08:27.563
now I just want you to do

08:27.568 --> 08:29.481
what you normally do.

08:29.497 --> 08:30.313
Okay.

08:32.865 --> 08:34.451
hmm, I'll just, uh...

08:35.177 --> 08:36.472
I forget what I do.

08:36.897 --> 08:37.792
Wait, what?

08:38.948 --> 08:40.940
This is some of what I do...

08:41.256 --> 08:42.003
I think.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.931
Sometimes I go places.

08:44.906 --> 08:46.932
This is our relish tray.

08:46.937 --> 08:48.991
I'd like you to film it for insurance purposes.

08:49.388 --> 08:51.890
Oh, what's the point of putting my socks on?

08:51.897 --> 08:55.063
I just have to take them off again a week later.

08:55.206 --> 08:57.852
Homer, before you even head
out the door in the morning,

08:57.856 --> 09:00.201
you're already a loser.

09:00.205 --> 09:03.100
Fine, I'll show you a winner, just you watch.

09:06.748 --> 09:09.041
Think positive, think positive.

09:14.376 --> 09:15.430
You were saying?

09:15.687 --> 09:19.073
Homer, your journey downstairs would've been a lot safer

09:19.076 --> 09:20.000
if you'd remembered

09:20.006 --> 09:22.320
the NDCs of concentration:

09:22.337 --> 09:24.273
Never Don't Concentrate.

09:24.318 --> 09:25.580
Will you shut up?

09:25.586 --> 09:27.232
I can't hear the song in my head!

09:29.275 --> 09:31.163
Do you want to get a reaction shot of his butt?

09:31.188 --> 09:33.291
No, but we should get some background noise.

09:33.765 --> 09:35.862
Everyone quiet for four seconds.

09:39.656 --> 09:41.611
Thank you, people.Moving on.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.093
Here's an important tip:

09:49.105 --> 09:50.263
Stop doing that.

09:53.528 --> 09:56.070
I really enjoyed paying you to yell at me

09:56.075 --> 09:58.353
and say I suck,but it's no use.

09:58.357 --> 10:00.713
I'm a hopeless loser and always will be.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.971
- Homer, you're up!
- This I can do!

10:16.708 --> 10:17.813
Yeah! Wow!

10:17.986 --> 10:18.900
- Boom!
- Way to go!

10:18.978 --> 10:22.303
Behold my 217 average and weep.

10:22.958 --> 10:25.500
As I said, I've lost all hope.

10:25.678 --> 10:28.920
Homer, here in the bowling alley,
you're a totally different man.

10:29.218 --> 10:32.703
- Relaxed, confident...
- Is this going somewhere?

10:33.216 --> 10:35.060
What we have to do
is figure a way to make

10:35.275 --> 10:38.500
"Bowling Alley Homer"
into "Everyday Homer."

10:38.798 --> 10:40.292
I have an aunt
who became an uncle.

10:40.585 --> 10:41.602
Is it like that?

10:43.916 --> 10:45.870
I want you to wear
those bowling shoes

10:46.047 --> 10:48.052
out the door and
everywhere you go.

10:48.345 --> 10:50.773
It's crazy, but it just might work.

10:51.116 --> 10:54.310
Dr. Fredrick J. Waxman,
you're a genius!

10:54.578 --> 10:55.643
That's not my name.

10:55.918 --> 10:56.970
I wasn't talking to you.

10:58.027 --> 11:06.721
<i>I'm the man</i>

10:59.745 --> 11:01.051
<i>I spell "M"</i>

11:02.097 --> 11:04.761
<i>"A" "N"</i>

11:05.736 --> 11:06.722
<i>Man...</i>

11:10.027 --> 11:13.170
Homer, your shoe attitude
is bowling people over.

11:13.367 --> 11:16.563
These are letters from companies
interested in interviewing you.

11:16.888 --> 11:18.502
How many of those
have private planes?

11:18.708 --> 11:19.673
This one.

11:21.026 --> 11:23.212
"Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing"?

11:23.475 --> 11:26.933
They need a safety inspector to fly
between their North American plants.

11:27.086 --> 11:28.483
I'm getting that job.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.981
Bart, I'll need some clean urine.
Stat.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.522
Now to make sure you're
motivated to get this job,

11:34.658 --> 11:35.900
you have to quit your old one.

11:36.155 --> 11:37.480
I'll call your boss right now.

11:41.707 --> 11:42.710
I'll get it, sir.

11:42.806 --> 11:44.440
Just send it to voice mail.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.461
You here for the
safety inspector job?

11:52.095 --> 11:56.400
Well, I can see the position of
hand somest CEO is already taken.

11:56.517 --> 11:57.833
I like you already.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.461
If you can write your name
so I can read it, you're in.

12:03.646 --> 12:04.833
I got the job!

12:04.945 --> 12:07.861
- Yay, Dad!
- We knew you could do it!

12:16.558 --> 12:18.122
Good luck on your first day, Dad.

12:18.227 --> 12:19.260
Give 'em hell, Homer.

12:20.495 --> 12:23.023
We're all so proud of you, sweetie.

12:24.905 --> 12:25.973
I'm gonna get there early,

12:26.175 --> 12:28.532
so I can get in good
with the lunch truck guy.

12:28.707 --> 12:31.340
Find out if he has a wife!
We could double date!

12:33.635 --> 12:35.430
- Yay, Dad.
- You're our hero.

12:48.138 --> 12:49.293
Can I help you?

12:49.567 --> 12:52.333
Uh, yeah. I have no
job and nowhere to go.

12:52.536 --> 12:55.233
What do I have to buy
so I can sit here all day?

12:55.485 --> 12:58.143
Well, with a coffee,
you can stay till lunch.

12:58.295 --> 13:00.093
Then you have to order a solid.

13:00.408 --> 13:01.970
One small coffee, please.

13:02.286 --> 13:04.923
And a dozen of those
placemats with the maze on it.

13:05.237 --> 13:06.920
They're all the same maze.

13:07.208 --> 13:08.363
Somebody's got to do 'em.

13:42.627 --> 13:43.810
Look happy.

13:48.965 --> 13:51.631
So, how was your first day
at your new job?

13:51.778 --> 13:53.261
Oh, it was great!

13:53.406 --> 13:55.122
Flew to Tulsa on the company jet.

13:55.315 --> 13:58.421
Did my job in a way consistent
with what I already told you.

13:58.787 --> 14:00.383
Because that's what you do.

14:00.648 --> 14:01.952
When you have a job.

14:02.126 --> 14:03.533
I'm so proud of you, Dad!

14:03.985 --> 14:05.813
Stop peppering me with questions!

14:08.038 --> 14:09.192
Principal Skinner,

14:09.448 --> 14:13.372
why did we have to leave the Learn
and Touch Reptile Zoo so early?

14:13.626 --> 14:17.510
Well, it seems someone was riding
the giant tortoise naked.

14:17.886 --> 14:18.772
It's not my fault.

14:19.036 --> 14:20.861
The drinking fountain
dared me to do it.

14:23.868 --> 14:25.693
Hmm? Freak fry!

14:25.876 --> 14:28.960
Look out!
If it touches you, you die of suicide!

14:30.198 --> 14:31.462
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

14:35.488 --> 14:36.552
Dad?

14:45.195 --> 14:46.672
I know it's you, Homer.

14:51.166 --> 14:52.681
Why aren't you at your new job?

14:52.897 --> 14:56.322
Well, explanation-wise,
the fact is that...

14:56.706 --> 14:58.462
I lied.
I didn't get the job.

14:58.718 --> 14:59.892
You see when I got there...

15:01.046 --> 15:01.942
So, she said,

15:02.148 --> 15:03.460
"That's not my in-box"

15:03.608 --> 15:06.550
and he said,
"That's not the Johnson Report!"

15:08.728 --> 15:12.043
You sure know how to repeat
the joke I just told ya.

15:13.448 --> 15:16.233
But, as a formality, I must ask:

15:16.456 --> 15:19.373
Do you know anything
about copper tubing?

15:19.967 --> 15:21.313
Um... well, uh...

15:23.287 --> 15:25.063
Come on, say
"You're hired"!

15:25.315 --> 15:27.280
- No.
- Say it!

15:27.565 --> 15:30.110
Leave your resume with Cheryl.

15:30.527 --> 15:33.941
- Say it!
- Security! Security!

15:34.146 --> 15:35.371
Stop saying "Security"!

15:35.495 --> 15:37.961
Come on, just give me the job.

15:38.345 --> 15:40.180
I like your hat.

15:40.426 --> 15:43.330
- Just say the word.
- Cheryl.

15:44.988 --> 15:48.473
I couldn't bear to tell your mother,
so I hang out here all day.

15:48.908 --> 15:50.162
But, Dad, you gotta tell her.

15:50.347 --> 15:52.490
She's been buying
brand-name groceries.

15:52.665 --> 15:54.842
Brands like "Miser's Choice"
and "Day-Old Delights"?

15:55.227 --> 15:58.711
No, things rich people buy,
like Campbell's Soup and Pepsodent.

16:05.777 --> 16:06.983
Hello?

16:07.487 --> 16:10.040
Honey, there's something
I have to tell you.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.611
It's bad news, isn't it?

16:11.867 --> 16:13.452
I should never get my hopes up.

16:13.605 --> 16:15.541
Nothing ever works out for us.

16:16.258 --> 16:18.470
No, it's, uh...
good news!

16:18.697 --> 16:19.700
Really?

16:20.747 --> 16:23.661
We're manufacturing
a new pipe diameter,

16:23.886 --> 16:24.782
five-eighths inch.

16:24.965 --> 16:26.760
The company wants you and me

16:26.996 --> 16:30.311
to take the private plane
to New York for the premiere!

16:30.538 --> 16:32.961
So meet me at Shelbyville
Airport in an hour.

16:33.938 --> 16:35.383
If I'm gonna tell
that woman the truth,

16:35.497 --> 16:38.462
I'm going to do it in the one place
no one can ever be sad.

16:40.215 --> 16:43.182
Okay, so this should be enough
money to get me up in the air,

16:43.416 --> 16:46.561
have a frank talk with Marge
then maybe eat a deviled egg.

16:46.865 --> 16:48.313
Well, anything,
for a fellow Marine.

16:48.586 --> 16:50.180
Yeah, semper fudge!

16:50.416 --> 16:52.611
Uh, did you just say
"Semper fudge"?

16:52.847 --> 16:53.833
No, I said the right thing.

16:54.817 --> 16:56.792
Look at this business center.

16:56.966 --> 17:00.711
Fax, Wi-Fi,
teleconferencing capabilities.

17:01.096 --> 17:04.740
I'm gonna remember this day
for the rest of my life!

17:05.086 --> 17:06.411
Uh, honey...

17:07.045 --> 17:09.563
don't try to remember
the whole day.

17:09.748 --> 17:11.392
Just what you're
feeling this second.

17:11.637 --> 17:13.512
Sweetheart, what do you mean?

17:13.748 --> 17:15.883
Marge, I gotta be honest...

17:16.567 --> 17:18.290
- What was that?
- I don't know.

17:18.637 --> 17:19.982
Maybe we flew through a rainbow.

17:25.566 --> 17:28.631
I didn't think I'd be flying
today so I was doing heroin.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.432
Homie, what are you doing?

17:33.656 --> 17:34.911
You don't know how to fly!

17:35.207 --> 17:37.653
I drove a car over a cliff once.
How different could it be?

17:38.936 --> 17:41.302
What's the ocean doing
in the sky?

17:46.207 --> 17:48.402
There's only one man
who can help us now.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.883
Hello, and welcome to success.

17:51.055 --> 17:52.102
It's Marge Simpson.

17:52.235 --> 17:55.050
I need you to coach like
you've never coached before!

17:55.237 --> 17:56.552
Marge, please, I'm with a client.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.261
Now you listen here, bub!

18:00.518 --> 18:03.102
We paid you all the savings
we had in the world.

18:03.367 --> 18:06.202
You could at least tell my
husband something encouraging.

18:06.755 --> 18:08.662
All right, Homer.
What is it you're attempting to do?

18:08.885 --> 18:10.163
Win over a difficult client?

18:10.387 --> 18:12.382
I'm trying to land a plane
with no experience.

18:14.105 --> 18:15.773
Homer, I gotta tell you
I'm not very good.

18:15.846 --> 18:17.530
I went to the Harvard of the South.

18:17.657 --> 18:18.883
Duke? That's good.

18:19.146 --> 18:20.581
- Not Duke.
- Vanderbilt?

18:20.745 --> 18:21.873
A little further south.

18:22.266 --> 18:23.550
Don't make me say it.

18:27.326 --> 18:29.880
Duffman has reported you
to the FAA.

18:30.135 --> 18:32.360
This near miss will be
investigated

18:32.505 --> 18:35.152
by a board of three retired pilots.

18:35.966 --> 18:36.913
Okay, Homer.

18:37.058 --> 18:39.703
I don't know anything about planes,
but I know about you.

18:39.926 --> 18:42.280
You have what made America great:

18:42.435 --> 18:45.273
no understanding of the limits
of your power,

18:45.417 --> 18:48.500
and a complete lack of concern
for what anyone thinks of you.

18:48.737 --> 18:50.300
So you'll land that plane.

18:50.615 --> 18:51.712
And do you know why?

18:51.967 --> 18:54.351
Because I heard some guy say
you couldn't.

18:54.725 --> 18:58.240
What? I'll show him.
I'll show that guy!

19:02.655 --> 19:05.920
Elevation 300 feet,
200 feet, 50 feet...

19:10.706 --> 19:12.161
Homer, you did it!

19:12.388 --> 19:13.641
You landed a jet!

19:13.735 --> 19:16.120
And now, to taxi to the terminal.

19:19.475 --> 19:20.421
D'oh!

19:26.557 --> 19:29.010
Marge, flying in private jets
is great and all,

19:29.187 --> 19:30.941
but it's just too dangerous.

19:31.398 --> 19:33.782
That's why I've decided
to go to the plant

19:33.926 --> 19:36.343
and beg Mr. Burns
for my old job back.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.351
I understand, Homie.

19:39.256 --> 19:40.312
And at least we can take

19:40.427 --> 19:42.541
the extra income you've earned
in the last few months

19:42.685 --> 19:44.550
and set it aside for a rainy day.

19:44.698 --> 19:46.333
You'd think so, but no.

19:47.576 --> 19:50.922
Mr. Richie, your American Music
Awards are weighing us down!

19:51.128 --> 19:52.290
Let them go!

19:52.518 --> 19:54.720
- You let yours go!
- I don't have any.

19:54.836 --> 19:56.252
That's right, you don't!
