WEBVTT

00:10.171 --> 00:11.679
He hates them.

00:11.681 --> 00:13.614
He's always in a rage.

00:13.616 --> 00:15.981
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

00:15.983 --> 00:19.221
"You're mine. You can't escape."

00:19.223 --> 00:21.299
There's a black mist
coming out of the wall.

00:21.301 --> 00:23.501
I'm seeing the blood on the walls.

00:24.339 --> 00:25.673
He was pretty ruthless.

00:25.675 --> 00:27.777
And I felt two hands, like that.

00:27.779 --> 00:29.884
And it just goes whoosh.

00:29.886 --> 00:32.930
Its goal is to kill all these women.

00:33.969 --> 00:35.903
"You're mine. You can't escape."

00:35.905 --> 00:39.107
My name is Amy Allan.

00:39.109 --> 00:41.145
What's happening?

00:41.147 --> 00:42.249
I see dead people.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.725
It seems like a devil.

00:44.727 --> 00:47.369
I speak to dead people.

00:47.371 --> 00:48.370
He's pissed off.

00:48.372 --> 00:49.539
And they speak to me.

00:49.541 --> 00:51.677
I felt real fear.

00:51.679 --> 00:54.655
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:54.657 --> 00:56.664
I think she's being murdered.

00:56.666 --> 00:58.271
I rely on my partner.

00:58.273 --> 00:59.540
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:59.542 --> 01:01.545
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:01.547 --> 01:03.651
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:03.653 --> 01:06.858
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.061
Nobody believes me.

01:08.063 --> 01:09.531
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.533 --> 01:11.807
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:11.809 --> 01:13.542
But Steve and I never speak...

01:13.544 --> 01:15.579
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:15.581 --> 01:16.782
Until the very end.

01:16.784 --> 01:18.556
You got problems. I got news for you.

01:18.558 --> 01:20.764
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:20.766 --> 01:22.836
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

01:22.838 --> 01:24.609
Or time to get out.

01:24.611 --> 01:26.782
This is their house, the house of the dead.

01:47.862 --> 01:49.529
I'm in Hanover, Pennsylvania,

01:49.531 --> 01:51.396
about two hours outside of Philly.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.269
I'm on my way to meet
with a woman named Deanna.

01:55.271 --> 01:57.372
Now, she sounded really
desperate on the phone.

01:57.374 --> 02:01.080
She thinks the house is
slowly trying to kill her.

02:01.082 --> 02:03.250
I'm hoping Amy and I can
get to the bottom of this

02:03.252 --> 02:04.317
and help this woman out.

02:09.924 --> 02:11.393
Before Amy arrives,

02:11.395 --> 02:13.164
I look for any leading information.

02:14.967 --> 02:17.035
Family photos and religious icons

02:17.037 --> 02:18.705
could influence her findings,

02:18.707 --> 02:21.110
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all

02:21.112 --> 02:23.012
before she begins her walk.

02:39.300 --> 02:44.542
There's something here,
but I don't know what it is.

02:44.544 --> 02:46.678
I'm hearing it goes way, way back.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.883
It goes way, way, way back.

02:49.885 --> 02:52.987
It affects the women mostly,

02:52.989 --> 02:55.891
but it touches everyone around them.

02:55.893 --> 03:00.601
Either they lost their kids or
their husband or their lives.

03:03.372 --> 03:08.546
And I think that its goal
is to kill all these women.

03:15.050 --> 03:16.917
Deanna, you
sounded pretty hysterical

03:16.919 --> 03:18.187
on the phone when we spoke.

03:18.189 --> 03:19.890
Now that I'm here, I need you to tell me

03:19.892 --> 03:21.125
what the hell is going on.

03:21.127 --> 03:23.059
I want my home back.

03:23.061 --> 03:25.461
I feel like I live in a house of hell.

03:26.865 --> 03:29.965
I'm so tired of it. I'm so done of it.

03:29.967 --> 03:31.668
What's going on?

03:31.670 --> 03:33.971
I'm seeing apparitions.

03:33.973 --> 03:35.840
I'm seeing shadow figures.

03:35.842 --> 03:37.576
We're seeing black mists.

03:37.578 --> 03:38.978
I'm hearing growls.

03:38.980 --> 03:42.816
I'm being bit, scratched.

03:42.818 --> 03:44.218
The attacks that you've had,

03:44.220 --> 03:45.220
how often do they happen?

03:45.222 --> 03:46.788
Every day.

03:46.790 --> 03:47.990
Geez.

03:47.992 --> 03:49.357
Why don't you just move?

03:49.359 --> 03:53.296
I'll be damned if anybody is
gonna run me out of my house.

03:53.298 --> 03:55.196
We're gonna get this fixed.

03:55.198 --> 03:58.766
Well, I like this attitude,
to be honest with you.

03:58.768 --> 04:00.501
How long you living here?

04:00.503 --> 04:01.702
Seven years.

04:01.704 --> 04:02.936
Okay, and you live here with your husband.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.170
Yes, Tom. And it's just the two of you?

04:04.172 --> 04:07.072
Yes. Initially, my first
daughter lived here,

04:07.074 --> 04:08.739
but she had to move out.

04:08.741 --> 04:10.439
She had to move out?

04:10.441 --> 04:11.940
She couldn't take it.

04:11.942 --> 04:13.811
Okay, so, seven years
has this being going on,

04:13.813 --> 04:15.513
or has it had progressively gotten worse?

04:15.515 --> 04:17.848
It has progressively gotten worse.

04:17.850 --> 04:19.015
I've got to the point

04:19.017 --> 04:21.315
where I won't even sleep upstairs anymore.

04:21.317 --> 04:22.884
I don't even sleep with my own husband.

04:22.886 --> 04:24.386
Where are you sleeping?

04:24.388 --> 04:26.622
I'm sleeping in the spare bedroom.

04:26.624 --> 04:28.956
Okay, is it easier for you to sleep there?

04:28.958 --> 04:30.489
No. I have no safe haven.

04:30.491 --> 04:33.460
No matter where I go in this
house, I can't find relief.

04:39.134 --> 04:40.634
I'm seeing this woman.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.933
Oh...

04:46.935 --> 04:50.039
Overwhelming panic, overwhelming fear,

04:50.041 --> 04:53.407
and got to get away, got
to get out, got to get away.

04:53.409 --> 04:54.874
This is a living woman?

04:54.876 --> 04:56.342
Yes.

04:56.344 --> 05:01.410
Moving from room to room to
room to room, trying to be...

05:01.412 --> 05:02.878
Well, if I go here, will this help it?

05:02.880 --> 05:04.246
Will I go here, will this help it?

05:04.248 --> 05:05.848
Will this make it stop?
Will this make it stop?

05:05.850 --> 05:06.882
Will this make it stop?

05:06.884 --> 05:10.151
And the thing...
this thing's saying,

05:10.153 --> 05:11.821
"No, it doesn't matter where you are.

05:11.823 --> 05:13.223
I'll find you. I'll find you."

05:13.225 --> 05:15.792
Uh, "You're mine. You can't escape."

05:18.991 --> 05:23.193
And I hear a deep male voice.

05:23.195 --> 05:26.595
Is this the thing that tries to kill women?

05:26.597 --> 05:28.029
Yes.

05:28.031 --> 05:30.430
Ugh, I feel like he
comes up from the grave.

05:30.432 --> 05:31.465
He was alive.

05:31.467 --> 05:33.832
He was a... a
living person once.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.239
Ah, this is...
it's very creepy.

05:38.241 --> 05:41.477
It's very... this
is [bleep] creepy.

05:47.846 --> 05:51.151
But did things get
better when you moved down here?

05:51.153 --> 05:52.319
No.

05:52.321 --> 05:53.988
Like, one time, I was laying on my side,

05:53.990 --> 05:57.525
and as I was asleep,
I just felt a stroking,

05:57.527 --> 06:00.226
just stroking my hair, stroking,

06:00.228 --> 06:02.530
and then when I opened up my eyes to look,

06:02.532 --> 06:06.835
there was this woman in
period dress, late 1800s.

06:06.837 --> 06:08.303
She looks like a farmer

06:08.305 --> 06:10.505
or some kind of, um, housekeeper.

06:10.507 --> 06:12.908
Okay, so, if you saw a
sketch or a photo of her,

06:12.910 --> 06:14.010
would you recognize her?

06:14.012 --> 06:14.911
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

06:14.913 --> 06:16.378
Anything else going on in here?

06:16.380 --> 06:18.878
Yes.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.214
When I wake up,

06:20.216 --> 06:23.520
this is what I have on me
in the middle of my back.

06:23.522 --> 06:26.023
Could you have possibly
done this to yourself

06:26.025 --> 06:27.692
in the middle of the night?

06:27.694 --> 06:30.262
No. This is as far as I can reach.

06:31.364 --> 06:34.303
Is there anything else that
you are experiencing here?

06:34.305 --> 06:37.107
Yes, I have this one particular dream

06:37.109 --> 06:38.977
that just keeps recurring.

06:38.979 --> 06:40.313
I'm in a cemetery,

06:40.315 --> 06:43.148
and as I'm looking through the cemetery,

06:43.150 --> 06:46.853
these five monks levitating, no feet,

06:46.855 --> 06:48.652
come straight for me.

06:48.654 --> 06:51.524
Then out of nowhere,
this, like, a shadow man.

06:51.526 --> 06:54.460
He's super tall. He's got the black cloak.

06:54.462 --> 06:58.061
He shot up from the ground, just pomp!

06:58.063 --> 07:00.898
And at that point when he shot up,

07:00.900 --> 07:02.266
I was pinned down,

07:02.268 --> 07:05.301
and then I opened my eyes
like, "Deanna, it's a dream.

07:05.303 --> 07:07.003
"Get out of this. It's a dream.

07:07.005 --> 07:08.004
Wake up."

07:08.006 --> 07:09.371
And when I woke up,

07:09.373 --> 07:12.774
he was standing at the
at the side of the bed,

07:12.776 --> 07:17.080
looking at me, about 7' tall, red eyes.

07:17.082 --> 07:19.281
He had, like, a hat.

07:19.283 --> 07:23.021
And as soon as you saw
him, you know it's evil.

07:23.023 --> 07:24.422
What'd you do?

07:24.424 --> 07:25.957
Oh, my God, I just started bawling,

07:25.959 --> 07:27.226
put the covers over my head,

07:27.228 --> 07:29.130
just, "Dear Lord, get him out. Get him out.

07:29.132 --> 07:30.464
Dear Lord, please help me."

07:30.466 --> 07:31.897
Then what?

07:31.899 --> 07:34.499
Then he said, "Your Yahweh
cannot help you now."

07:34.501 --> 07:36.001
What the hell is that?

07:36.003 --> 07:38.003
It's another term for God.

07:41.540 --> 07:44.708
She thinks they're dreams,
but they're not dreams.

07:45.944 --> 07:48.377
She's [bleep] awake.

07:48.379 --> 07:53.182
He holds her down, and he's
telling her, "I smell you.

07:53.184 --> 07:55.017
I taste you. I've got you."

07:55.019 --> 07:57.385
He comes to the side of the bed.

07:57.387 --> 08:00.960
He's always, like, over
her, hovering over her.

08:04.064 --> 08:05.798
He manipulates how he's seen.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.801
He can look like smoke.

08:07.803 --> 08:11.707
He has a hat, a black hat.

08:11.709 --> 08:15.845
His face is rotting.

08:15.847 --> 08:18.080
He's smelling me.

08:18.082 --> 08:20.851
It's giving me chills down my back,

08:20.853 --> 08:24.187
but it really is very disturbing.

08:24.189 --> 08:26.122
Oh

08:42.678 --> 08:43.943
And this is the room

08:43.946 --> 08:45.612
you used to sleep in with your husband.

08:45.614 --> 08:46.545
That's correct.

08:46.547 --> 08:47.946
So, now what would happen up here

08:47.948 --> 08:49.344
that you're not sleeping up here?

08:49.346 --> 08:51.445
I was coming up the steps,

08:51.447 --> 08:53.580
and then I felt two hands just, like that.

08:53.582 --> 08:54.781
- So, that hard?
- That hard.

08:54.783 --> 08:58.386
I was shoved, and I just fell right off.

08:58.388 --> 09:01.123
I mean, my feet were kicked
off, and I hit the wall.

09:03.692 --> 09:05.992
And I landed on the floor down there.

09:05.994 --> 09:07.060
I couldn't breathe.

09:07.062 --> 09:08.728
The wind had been knocked out of me.

09:10.161 --> 09:12.894
It felt like something
was just sitting on me.

09:12.896 --> 09:15.599
I could not move, and
I had excruciating pain.

09:15.601 --> 09:17.267
You must be frightened every time

09:17.269 --> 09:19.568
- you've got to come up these stairs now.
- Yeah.

09:26.409 --> 09:28.710
It feels like somebody's
literally going like,

09:28.712 --> 09:30.878
"Oh, you're not coming up here.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.312
Oh, no, you don't."

09:32.314 --> 09:36.081
Like, I just feel that coming
down the stairs towards me.

09:45.396 --> 09:47.031
Oh, this is...

09:55.875 --> 09:59.342
I'm seeing the sniffy guy.

09:59.344 --> 10:02.912
He's much more aggressive downstairs.

10:02.914 --> 10:06.251
Here, he's almost like a seducing,

10:06.253 --> 10:09.752
like, soothing, but it's bad.

10:09.754 --> 10:11.253
It's fake.

10:11.255 --> 10:15.789
It's so he can figure you out...

10:15.791 --> 10:19.561
and he can destroy you.

10:41.996 --> 10:43.730
Tom, I was talking to your wife, Deanna,

10:43.732 --> 10:44.865
and, uh, she told me

10:44.867 --> 10:47.268
about the horrific things
she's going through.

10:47.270 --> 10:48.969
Now, you guys aren't
even sleeping together,

10:48.971 --> 10:50.838
really, anymore, right?
She's sleeping downstairs?

10:50.840 --> 10:52.471
Right, she's sleeping downstairs now, yep.

10:52.473 --> 10:55.273
It takes its toll on, uh, me.

10:55.275 --> 10:56.275
I'm sure it's taking its toll on her.

10:56.277 --> 10:57.578
And what about moving?

10:57.580 --> 11:00.144
- You ever take that into consideration?
- No.

11:00.146 --> 11:03.178
Nobody's gonna tell me
to get out of my house.

11:03.180 --> 11:05.046
Are... are you
a skeptic at all?

11:05.048 --> 11:08.784
Certain things, I can't find
a reason for or an answer for.

11:08.786 --> 11:10.152
Okay.

11:10.154 --> 11:11.387
I'm skeptical, but, yeah,

11:11.389 --> 11:13.123
I'd still like to find
the answers to things.

11:13.125 --> 11:14.658
Okay, but you've had some
experiences, is that right?

11:14.660 --> 11:15.926
Yes.

11:15.928 --> 11:18.262
I hear footsteps and
then, I don't see anything.

11:18.264 --> 11:19.730
Where'd you hear the footsteps?

11:19.732 --> 11:21.833
Uh, it sounded like they
were walking on the roof

11:21.835 --> 11:23.203
when we were in the bedroom.

11:23.205 --> 11:24.805
And when we're in the family room,

11:24.807 --> 11:27.173
it sounds like they're going
up and down the steps here

11:27.175 --> 11:28.810
to the basement and to the bedroom.

11:28.812 --> 11:31.148
Do you ever think somebody's
breaking into the house?

11:31.150 --> 11:33.483
I don't think that, 'cause
I do have a security system.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.486
I would know if somebody
broke into the house.

11:35.488 --> 11:37.422
Okay. Has anything else like that happened?

11:37.424 --> 11:40.757
Deanna and I were upstairs in the bedroom,

11:40.759 --> 11:44.261
sitting and talking one
time, and, uh, I heard voices.

11:44.263 --> 11:46.028
Like, I would say something,
and it would repeat.

11:46.030 --> 11:47.329
And she would say something,
it would repeat it,

11:47.331 --> 11:48.862
like, mocking us.

11:48.864 --> 11:49.996
That I can't explain, 'cause I heard it.

11:49.998 --> 11:51.130
She heard it.

11:51.132 --> 11:52.698
Was anybody else in
the house with you guys?

11:52.700 --> 11:53.866
No, just her and I.

11:53.868 --> 11:55.267
It couldn't have been
somebody from outside.

11:55.269 --> 11:56.602
They wouldn't have been able to hear you.

11:56.604 --> 11:57.903
Right, and they wouldn't
have been able to repeat

11:57.905 --> 11:59.171
what we were saying 'cause
they wouldn't have heard us.

12:06.043 --> 12:10.211
I hate it down here. I hate it.

12:13.579 --> 12:14.680
I see, like, a teenage girl

12:14.682 --> 12:16.215
getting the [bleep] beat out of her.

12:16.217 --> 12:17.684
By who?

12:20.319 --> 12:22.455
It's a short man.

12:22.457 --> 12:23.890
Uh, he's kind of pudgy.

12:23.892 --> 12:26.327
He has, like, some kind of job

12:26.329 --> 12:30.401
that puts him in a position
of power over people.

12:31.804 --> 12:32.904
Oh! Oh, oh!

12:34.708 --> 12:37.278
I think this man has a
heart attack here and dies.

12:37.280 --> 12:41.816
This is a different guy than
the... the guy, the other guy.

12:41.818 --> 12:42.884
He's always...

12:42.886 --> 12:45.054
It's... it's like
you can hear this guy,

12:45.056 --> 12:47.123
ah, 'cause he's always yelling.

12:47.125 --> 12:51.295
You'll hear, like, him, like,
stomping around down here,

12:51.297 --> 12:54.632
or, like, causing a ruckus, like, yelling.

12:54.634 --> 12:55.833
He's angry, this one.

12:55.835 --> 12:57.803
He's, like, always [bleep] angry.

12:57.805 --> 12:59.472
I feel like he's gonna attack me,

12:59.474 --> 13:01.508
like he's gonna beat the [bleep] out of me.

13:09.046 --> 13:10.749
What's going on up here?

13:10.751 --> 13:12.886
Deanna and I were sitting
at the kitchen table,

13:12.888 --> 13:14.188
and she was telling me

13:14.190 --> 13:16.724
about all the bruises
she's had on her arms.

13:16.726 --> 13:18.526
And I was just kidding, said,

13:18.528 --> 13:20.896
"Oh, it's probably the
ghost did that to you."

13:20.898 --> 13:23.631
And it wasn't long, I said,
"Hey, I feel a burn on my arm."

13:23.633 --> 13:25.233
And I had a long-sleeve shirt on,

13:25.235 --> 13:26.334
rolled up the sleeve,

13:26.336 --> 13:28.169
and I had a single scratch mark across it.

13:28.171 --> 13:29.402
What about the cats?

13:29.404 --> 13:31.237
- Were you playing with the cats at all?
- No.

13:31.239 --> 13:32.272
No, and our cats are declawed,

13:32.274 --> 13:33.372
so they couldn't have scratched.

13:33.374 --> 13:35.173
Anything else?

13:35.175 --> 13:37.177
We were sitting in the family room,

13:37.179 --> 13:39.312
and the cats were here in the kitchen,

13:39.314 --> 13:40.445
making weird noises.

13:40.447 --> 13:41.411
So, we both got up.

13:41.413 --> 13:43.179
Deanna turned the kitchen light on,

13:43.181 --> 13:45.781
and coming out, like, right in this area,

13:45.783 --> 13:49.045
there was, like, a black
mist coming out of the wall,

13:49.047 --> 13:51.545
and it wasn't long, it just, hanging there.

13:51.547 --> 13:54.278
And then, it just started
twirling like a tornado,

13:54.280 --> 13:55.747
and it went right up.

13:55.749 --> 13:59.451
I think the spot's still
there today, right up in there.

13:59.453 --> 14:00.785
I can see it.

14:00.787 --> 14:02.950
Have you tried painting over that or...

14:02.952 --> 14:04.618
We did try painting over it.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.253
It didn't... it
doesn't cover it.

14:06.255 --> 14:07.688
Has anything else happened in here?

14:07.690 --> 14:09.957
I get foul odors every so often,

14:09.959 --> 14:11.591
and it smells like urine,

14:11.593 --> 14:14.662
fecal odors, and kerosene
every once in a while.

14:14.664 --> 14:16.928
No septic tank problems
or anything like that?

14:16.930 --> 14:18.561
Nope, we're on, uh, town sewer.

14:18.563 --> 14:20.865
No problems with the pipes
backing up or anything?

14:20.867 --> 14:22.367
No, never a problem with that.

14:22.369 --> 14:23.502
You walk into it,

14:23.504 --> 14:25.104
and it just kind of takes your breath away.

14:30.541 --> 14:32.576
What is this thing?

14:32.578 --> 14:34.446
Oof.

14:36.513 --> 14:39.148
Like a rush.

14:41.687 --> 14:45.055
I see, like, this person
comes out of that room,

14:45.057 --> 14:46.658
is like, "Hello."

14:46.660 --> 14:49.860
"Uh-huh," goes in here,
is, like, walking out here,

14:49.862 --> 14:52.799
and then all of a sudden,
like, the door flies open,

14:52.801 --> 14:56.936
and the living people
here see a black mist.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.940
This is the angry guy from the basement,

14:58.942 --> 15:02.778
and it's stinky, a really bad smell.

15:04.016 --> 15:06.687
And it just goes whoosh at the person.

15:06.689 --> 15:10.222
He has hostility toward women.

15:10.224 --> 15:12.359
Yep.

15:12.361 --> 15:15.796
I feel like he's capable
of harming someone.

15:35.646 --> 15:38.348
One of the first calls I
made was to a local author

15:38.350 --> 15:41.018
who knows Hanover's history
backwards and forwards.

15:41.020 --> 15:44.721
He told me the original settler
of Tom and Deanna's property

15:44.723 --> 15:47.158
was literally destroyed by the land.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.362
I'm heading over to meet with
him now to see what he means.

15:59.272 --> 16:02.739
The original settler was
a man named John Digges.

16:02.741 --> 16:07.947
He was an upper crust,
connected, well-to-do person

16:07.949 --> 16:10.082
from Maryland, owned
some plantations there.

16:10.084 --> 16:15.947
He was granted 10,000
acres of land in 1727.

16:15.949 --> 16:20.253
This whole 10,000 acres
was called Digges' Choice.

16:20.255 --> 16:22.887
Where on this map would
my clients' house be?

16:22.889 --> 16:25.257
Right here.

16:25.259 --> 16:26.925
Okay.

16:26.927 --> 16:30.196
He had a fairly sizable
plantation that he farmed,

16:30.198 --> 16:33.166
but he also wanted to
sell the rest of the land

16:33.168 --> 16:36.004
and make as much money
as he could off of it.

16:36.006 --> 16:38.675
The problem was, there were other settlers

16:38.677 --> 16:42.080
that were coming in along
the edges of this property

16:42.082 --> 16:44.182
instead of buying land from him.

16:44.184 --> 16:45.815
He didn't like that very much.

16:45.817 --> 16:47.650
Okay.

16:47.652 --> 16:50.119
So, sometimes, he would try
to make them pay for the land.

16:50.121 --> 16:52.853
Sometimes, he'd try to force them out.

16:52.855 --> 16:56.494
He and his sons would go out with guns

16:56.496 --> 16:58.597
- and try to run 'em off.
- Wow.

16:58.599 --> 17:01.366
- He was pretty ruthless...
- Okay.

17:01.368 --> 17:02.500
With the way he enforced it.

17:07.040 --> 17:13.049
I'm seeing the sniffy
guy when he was alive.

17:16.553 --> 17:18.557
Can you describe him?

17:18.559 --> 17:20.659
Uh...

17:25.429 --> 17:27.695
Power.

17:27.698 --> 17:30.235
I feel, like, judgment.

17:30.237 --> 17:37.778
Or he felt he could judge
and, um, control people.

17:37.780 --> 17:41.048
Yeah, I see him.

17:41.050 --> 17:43.985
I see him, I see him, I see an older man.

17:43.987 --> 17:49.587
He had this power to
control their destinies,

17:49.589 --> 17:52.323
and that's what he's still doing.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.862
And... and he says,
"I could smell it.

17:56.864 --> 17:58.265
I could smell it, and I
could taste it on them."

17:58.267 --> 17:59.368
Smell what?

17:59.370 --> 18:02.401
Oh, fear.

18:02.403 --> 18:03.770
He hates them.

18:03.772 --> 18:05.707
He [bleep] hates them.

18:08.037 --> 18:09.638
Now, Jan, you mentioned on the phone

18:09.640 --> 18:11.408
that the land basically destroyed Digges.

18:11.410 --> 18:12.644
What did you mean by that?

18:12.646 --> 18:16.712
Well, in 1752, Digges sent his two sons

18:16.714 --> 18:18.812
to intimidate one of the settlers,

18:18.814 --> 18:20.046
Martin Kitzmiller,

18:20.048 --> 18:23.653
that Digges felt was
trespassing, basically.

18:23.655 --> 18:27.823
So, Martin calls for a son
of his, his name was Jacob,

18:27.825 --> 18:29.291
to come help him.

18:29.293 --> 18:31.891
He came with a shotgun,

18:31.893 --> 18:35.493
and in a struggle between Dudley Digges,

18:35.495 --> 18:38.429
one of John's sons, and Jacob,

18:38.431 --> 18:40.096
the gun accidentally went off,

18:40.098 --> 18:42.698
and Dudley was shot and killed.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.000
Okay.

18:44.002 --> 18:47.138
Here's an article that
appeared in the "York" paper

18:47.140 --> 18:49.307
a couple of days after the shooting.

18:49.309 --> 18:52.442
Martin and Jacob Kitzmiller

18:52.444 --> 18:55.446
immediately turned
themselves in to authorities.

18:55.448 --> 18:58.148
There was a coroner's inquest and a trial,

18:58.150 --> 19:02.888
and basically, the trial
destroys John Digges.

19:02.890 --> 19:06.294
The two people that he
thought murdered his son

19:06.296 --> 19:07.462
are acquitted.

19:07.464 --> 19:08.762
They were acquitted?

19:08.764 --> 19:11.263
- Yes, it was considered accidental.
- Okay.

19:11.265 --> 19:13.232
And the judge ruled

19:13.234 --> 19:15.634
that most of this land wasn't even his.

19:15.636 --> 19:18.134
Wow. Added insult to injury.

19:18.136 --> 19:19.902
It... it
breaks him.

19:19.904 --> 19:22.405
So, now, what happens
with... with Digges?

19:22.407 --> 19:26.410
He moves shortly after
the murder to Maryland,

19:26.412 --> 19:30.914
pretty much broke, and dies in 1760.

19:30.916 --> 19:32.985
Do we know where he's buried at all?

19:32.987 --> 19:35.020
All we know is he died in Maryland.

19:35.022 --> 19:38.594
Okay. Now, do we know
where Dudley's buried?

19:38.596 --> 19:41.930
Yes, he's buried on the
property, Digges' Choice.

19:49.268 --> 19:52.168
It's one person alone in here.

19:53.538 --> 19:56.907
Buried. He's buried very
close, very, very close.

20:09.220 --> 20:11.290
I'm seeing blood.

20:11.292 --> 20:14.363
Where?

20:14.365 --> 20:16.029
On the walls.

20:20.168 --> 20:23.069
It's making me anxious.
It's making me anxious.

20:23.071 --> 20:25.171
Uh...

20:25.173 --> 20:28.672
I feel trapped. I feel scared.

20:28.674 --> 20:30.072
I feel like I can't breathe.

20:30.074 --> 20:32.007
I feel like I'm choking on my tongue.

20:34.209 --> 20:35.940
I'm seeing the blood on the walls.

20:38.377 --> 20:40.776
I'm seeing the blood on the walls.

20:55.237 --> 20:56.906
So far, I've got a family

20:56.908 --> 20:59.079
that's being terrorized
by unexplained activity

20:59.081 --> 21:03.188
in a property that's been
the cause of bloodshed.

21:04.191 --> 21:06.294
But I need to see if there's anything else.

21:06.296 --> 21:08.232
Searching through old property records,

21:08.234 --> 21:09.514
I find a woman named Lydia Small,

21:09.614 --> 21:11.745
who used to live on my clients' land.

21:11.747 --> 21:14.683
Turns out, she lost four
children to drowning accidents,

21:14.685 --> 21:18.220
three of them in the same quarry.

21:18.222 --> 21:21.522
I'm heading over to meet
with a local genealogist

21:21.524 --> 21:24.958
who says Lydia Small's
suffering on my clients' property

21:24.960 --> 21:26.127
didn't even end there.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.036
Well, Stephanie, thanks for meeting me.

21:36.038 --> 21:39.004
I came across these articles
about this woman, Lydia,

21:39.006 --> 21:39.846
who lost four kids to drowning.

21:40.246 --> 21:43.577
Yes, yes, she did. The
first one was in 1890.

21:43.677 --> 21:47.146
It was her daughter, who
was, um, a year and a half.

21:47.148 --> 21:49.981
They had had a well in the backyard.

21:49.983 --> 21:53.386
The little girl wandered out
and fell down into the well.

21:53.388 --> 21:55.521
That was the first of the four.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.221
The second incident, sadly,

21:57.223 --> 21:59.455
involved two of Lydia's children.

21:59.457 --> 22:01.221
Her 4-year-old
son, Dewey,

22:01.223 --> 22:04.486
and her 7-year-old daughter,
Florence, were playing

22:04.488 --> 22:06.688
down by the edge of the quarry.

22:06.690 --> 22:07.921
Dewey fell in.

22:07.923 --> 22:11.024
Their older sister, Irene, who was 12,

22:11.026 --> 22:12.593
jumped in to try to save him,

22:12.595 --> 22:14.427
and both of those children drowned.

22:14.429 --> 22:15.827
All right.

22:15.829 --> 22:18.495
So, that's three drownings,
but what was the fourth one?

22:18.497 --> 22:20.396
The fourth one was Florence.

22:20.398 --> 22:23.565
She and her mother were
along the edge of the quarry,

22:23.567 --> 22:25.667
once again, picking raspberries,

22:25.669 --> 22:29.300
and Florence, too, had
fallen into the quarry

22:29.302 --> 22:31.866
and unfortunately drowned.

22:31.868 --> 22:33.066
So, let me get this straight.

22:33.068 --> 22:34.966
She loses three kids to
drowning, two in the quarry,

22:34.968 --> 22:37.167
- and she takes another kid near it.
- Yes.

22:37.169 --> 22:39.437
So now, you mentioned on the phone

22:39.439 --> 22:42.774
that she had a lot worse
tragedy in her life.

22:42.776 --> 22:45.307
The drownings of her four
children were just the start.

22:45.309 --> 22:48.279
In 1907, she had a son.

22:48.281 --> 22:49.682
His name was John Jacob,

22:49.684 --> 22:53.055
and he died of what was at
the time called convulsions.

22:53.057 --> 22:55.324
And then sadly, shortly thereafter,

22:55.326 --> 22:57.326
she lost her husband, as well.

22:57.328 --> 22:59.128
He worked at the quarry

22:59.130 --> 23:01.530
and was actually crushed to death

23:01.532 --> 23:04.400
when a cable car full of bricks came back

23:04.402 --> 23:06.735
and fell on him and crushed him.

23:06.737 --> 23:09.035
So now, after all this
tragedy with this woman,

23:09.037 --> 23:10.669
what ended up happening to her?

23:10.671 --> 23:15.736
Well, on April 18th of 1939,
Lydia herself passed away.

23:15.738 --> 23:19.472
This is the notice that
appeared in the newspaper.

23:19.474 --> 23:21.910
She just wore out after
dealing with the loss

23:21.912 --> 23:24.677
and the hardship that she'd
suffered all those years.

23:24.679 --> 23:26.778
Her body just eventually gave out.

23:30.616 --> 23:33.984
There's a woman that's,
like, really losing it,

23:33.986 --> 23:35.653
like, losing her [bleep]

23:37.155 --> 23:38.820
Uh, she's just always, like, crying,

23:38.822 --> 23:41.255
and then I see a casket coming out.

23:41.257 --> 23:44.158
I see a casket coming out,
and then I see this woman...

23:44.160 --> 23:47.828
Just a mess.

23:47.830 --> 23:51.032
It's almost like she goes into denial.

23:51.034 --> 23:53.969
"That... that didn't happen.
It didn't happen, no."

24:01.507 --> 24:04.643
I think there's a lot
of things that happened

24:04.645 --> 24:06.645
one right after the other here.

24:06.647 --> 24:09.182
I think she lost somebody.

24:09.184 --> 24:11.451
I think she gets sick.

24:13.454 --> 24:18.094
It's like she might have made herself sick

24:18.096 --> 24:21.996
from not getting over everything.

24:21.998 --> 24:25.032
I feel, like, this illness in her body,

24:25.034 --> 24:27.398
like her stomach is affected.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.500
She wastes away, but I don't know

24:29.502 --> 24:32.802
if that's, like, from her emotional loss.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.270
Right.

24:34.272 --> 24:37.807
Because I feel this extreme
anger and this extreme sadness.

24:47.180 --> 24:50.283
I encountered many entities during my walk,

24:50.285 --> 24:53.054
but two stood out the most.

24:53.056 --> 24:55.592
First, the crying woman.

24:55.594 --> 24:59.190
You could see more of
the whites at the bottom.

24:59.192 --> 25:01.725
A very high forehead.

25:03.291 --> 25:07.391
Thicker here, and then,
they taper off pretty thin.

25:08.526 --> 25:10.727
Next, I described the creepy man

25:10.729 --> 25:13.030
tormenting a living woman in her bedroom.

25:13.032 --> 25:15.329
The bed sits catty-corner.

25:15.331 --> 25:20.101
This male comes out, but
it's like smoke, mist.

25:22.005 --> 25:25.008
He is leaning over her.

25:25.010 --> 25:28.879
It's very strange looking,
very creepy looking.

25:30.116 --> 25:31.150
Is that what you saw?

25:31.152 --> 25:33.986
Yes, that's what I saw.

25:56.361 --> 25:59.047
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

25:59.147 --> 26:01.845
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

26:01.847 --> 26:03.944
and our clients for the first time.

26:03.946 --> 26:06.345
Amy, I'd like you to meet Deanna and Tom.

26:06.347 --> 26:08.081
They're married. They live in this house.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.214
They've been living
through hell, basically.

26:10.216 --> 26:12.518
In the last few years,
it's gotten real physical.

26:12.520 --> 26:13.753
It's affecting their health

26:13.755 --> 26:15.455
and, actually, their
marriage at this point,

26:15.457 --> 26:17.356
and that's why they called us in for help.

26:18.725 --> 26:20.254
So, now that Amy knows just a little bit

26:20.354 --> 26:21.553
about what's going on,

26:21.555 --> 26:23.354
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

26:23.356 --> 26:24.739
One of the things that I got

26:24.839 --> 26:27.741
when I first came into the home

26:27.743 --> 26:34.680
was that this house is
extremely unsafe for women.

26:34.682 --> 26:41.723
Women in this area have been
affected for a very long time,

26:41.725 --> 26:45.025
and bad things will happen.

26:45.027 --> 26:49.364
And then, I saw a lot of
dead women who are suffering.

26:49.366 --> 26:51.399
But the one that stood out the most to me

26:51.401 --> 26:54.069
was freaking out, crying.

26:54.071 --> 26:58.207
She was, like, yelling a
lot, and then the door opened,

26:58.209 --> 27:02.612
and a casket came out of the front door.

27:02.614 --> 27:06.248
What I gathered from her
freaking out and yelling

27:06.250 --> 27:09.953
was that, whoever that
person was who died, she felt,

27:09.955 --> 27:13.020
you know, it was... it
was extremely sudden.

27:13.022 --> 27:15.756
So, I felt, in the end,

27:15.758 --> 27:21.463
she became sick from not
dealing with this death.

27:21.465 --> 27:23.798
There was a woman that
lived on your property line.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.801
Her name was Lydia Small.

27:25.803 --> 27:30.367
This is a stack of articles
regarding her loss in life.

27:30.369 --> 27:32.466
What?!

27:32.468 --> 27:34.167
She lived here?

27:34.169 --> 27:35.601
She lived on the property line.

27:35.603 --> 27:37.938
1890, she had a daughter, 20 months old,

27:37.940 --> 27:39.140
I think the kid was,

27:39.142 --> 27:41.374
drowned in the well right on the property.

27:41.376 --> 27:45.543
1902, her 4-year-old
son, Dewey,

27:45.545 --> 27:48.279
and her 7-year-old
daughter, Florence,

27:48.281 --> 27:50.950
were playing by the quarry, swimming.

27:50.952 --> 27:52.583
Dewey goes under.

27:52.585 --> 27:55.484
The 12-year-old sister,
Irene, jumps into the water

27:55.486 --> 27:57.816
to rescue her brother, and she drowned.

27:57.818 --> 27:58.816
Oh, my gosh.

27:58.818 --> 28:00.049
They find their two bodies later on.

28:00.051 --> 28:01.850
So, now, she lost three kids to drowning.

28:01.852 --> 28:03.384
Oh, my gosh.

28:03.386 --> 28:05.085
It gets worse.

28:05.087 --> 28:06.917
1905, the kid, Florence,

28:06.919 --> 28:08.986
was picking berries right by the quarry.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.353
She falls in. She drowns.

28:11.355 --> 28:14.690
So, that's four kids died of drowning.

28:14.692 --> 28:16.359
Let's move over to 1907.

28:16.361 --> 28:19.425
Now she loses an
18-month-old to convulsions,

28:19.427 --> 28:21.896
probably from a high fever, I would assume.

28:21.898 --> 28:24.763
The year after this happens,
her husband, Jeremiah,

28:24.765 --> 28:29.869
who worked at the quarry
sending limestone rock

28:29.871 --> 28:31.337
up to the top of the quarry.

28:31.339 --> 28:34.171
Well, the cable snapped and
came down and crushed him.

28:34.173 --> 28:36.340
Oh, my gosh.

28:36.342 --> 28:39.008
Now, the whole tragedy with
Lydia and what she went through,

28:39.010 --> 28:40.576
she winds up dying in 1939,

28:40.578 --> 28:44.048
and I think the whole thing just
took a toll on her and she...

28:44.050 --> 28:46.586
Her body just deteriorated down to nothing.

28:46.588 --> 28:47.719
It's pretty sad.

28:49.823 --> 28:51.491
Now, you see a woman, right?

28:51.493 --> 28:52.561
Yes.

28:52.563 --> 28:57.062
This woman is, just like you said,

28:57.064 --> 29:04.771
just like I told you, very thin, sickly.

29:04.773 --> 29:06.439
So, do you think this is the woman you saw?

29:06.441 --> 29:08.840
I don't know, uh, but I did do a sketch.

29:23.223 --> 29:26.058
Wow.

29:26.060 --> 29:27.492
That's her.

29:30.926 --> 29:32.360
That's who I see.

29:35.629 --> 29:36.629
Ooh.

29:36.631 --> 29:39.669
It's all coming together.

29:39.671 --> 29:44.104
I would tell Tom of my stories,

29:44.106 --> 29:46.405
and I'm sharing with him.

29:46.407 --> 29:47.439
He's trying to connect to me.

29:47.441 --> 29:49.540
Right.

29:49.542 --> 29:51.475
- But he can't.
- Right.

29:51.477 --> 29:55.614
It's not affecting him like it is me.

29:55.616 --> 29:59.151
It justifies what I've been going through,

29:59.153 --> 30:00.888
hell, all this time.

30:00.890 --> 30:02.390
And how do you feel about it?

30:02.392 --> 30:05.761
I don't know how to answer that.

30:05.763 --> 30:08.466
It's putting a face to things she tells me,

30:08.468 --> 30:09.936
but I don't relate to it

30:09.938 --> 30:12.104
because it doesn't affect me, personally.

30:12.106 --> 30:13.703
It affects her.

30:13.705 --> 30:14.871
It makes me feel bad for that woman.

30:19.011 --> 30:20.778
What else you see?

30:20.780 --> 30:23.278
I started walking down the stairs,

30:23.280 --> 30:26.248
and in front of me, there was a male.

30:26.250 --> 30:30.785
And what I saw was, he was
beating up a teenage girl.

30:30.787 --> 30:35.589
This man had and has a lot of issues

30:35.591 --> 30:38.391
and anger, uh, towards and with women.

30:38.393 --> 30:40.092
You can hear this guy.

30:40.094 --> 30:44.161
You'll hear, like, him, like,
stomping around down here

30:44.163 --> 30:47.600
or, like, causing a
ruckus, like, yelling...

30:47.602 --> 30:50.202
And he shows himself like a black mist,

30:50.204 --> 30:51.669
uh, smoke.

30:51.671 --> 30:53.070
Oh, my God.

30:53.072 --> 30:56.109
And I was upstairs,

30:56.111 --> 31:00.513
and I smelled this horrible stench,

31:00.515 --> 31:04.921
and it was him.

31:04.923 --> 31:08.659
We see this big, black
mist coming from the wall,

31:08.661 --> 31:10.697
and then, in matter of seconds,

31:10.699 --> 31:13.098
it turned into, like, a tornado, like,

31:13.100 --> 31:15.198
and went straight up into the ceiling.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.570
Matter of fact, there's still a mark there

31:17.572 --> 31:19.573
from where it went into the ceiling.

31:19.575 --> 31:20.773
Yes.

31:20.775 --> 31:23.208
Now, you also mentioned
to me about the smells.

31:23.210 --> 31:24.510
I smell, like, either...

31:24.512 --> 31:26.881
smells of urine sometimes, sometimes fecal,

31:26.883 --> 31:29.117
and sometimes, I get kerosene.

31:29.119 --> 31:31.822
Yeah. It's pretty nasty, yeah.

31:31.824 --> 31:35.390
Well, you've seen a
lot on your walk so far.

31:35.392 --> 31:37.657
- Anything else go on?
- Yes.

31:37.659 --> 31:40.559
The person who was in the basement

31:40.561 --> 31:44.163
is not the main culprit here.

31:44.165 --> 31:45.564
Wow.

31:45.566 --> 31:48.633
It was actually an individual
I met on the first floor,

31:48.635 --> 31:51.802
a male, and what he does is,

31:51.804 --> 31:55.709
he literally crawls up out of the grave.

31:55.711 --> 31:59.814
He is extremely creepy.

31:59.816 --> 32:03.953
He sniffed all the way up my back,

32:03.955 --> 32:10.395
and it just was really disgusting,

32:10.397 --> 32:13.062
horrifying, degrading.

32:13.064 --> 32:14.998
And I was scared,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.705
and that's really unusual for me.

32:17.707 --> 32:22.340
He really hates women, and what he told me

32:22.342 --> 32:25.007
when, ugh, he got up to my ear was,

32:25.009 --> 32:27.473
he was like, "I can taste
it, and I can smell it."

32:27.475 --> 32:32.509
When I started going
up to the room upstairs,

32:32.511 --> 32:34.714
I felt someone pushing me back,

32:34.716 --> 32:38.019
holding me back at the
bottom of the stairs,

32:38.021 --> 32:40.856
like, a wall going up and,
like, two hands coming out

32:40.858 --> 32:42.660
and pushing me and being like,

32:42.662 --> 32:44.760
"Oh, no, you are not coming up here."

32:44.762 --> 32:46.996
Well, that's one of the
big reasons we're here.

32:46.998 --> 32:48.933
Deanna, tell Amy what happened to you.

32:48.935 --> 32:51.536
One night, I was going
up the steps to go to bed,

32:51.538 --> 32:53.571
and I was walking up the steps,

32:53.573 --> 32:56.676
I just stopped because I felt him.

32:56.678 --> 32:58.043
It was ferocious,

32:58.045 --> 33:01.013
and he just came up with such a force,

33:01.015 --> 33:02.582
and just went vroom,

33:02.584 --> 33:07.619
and I flew off the steps
and skid into the kitchen.

33:07.621 --> 33:09.854
She had a fractured tailbone.

33:09.856 --> 33:11.322
Oh, wow.

33:11.324 --> 33:13.524
She actually moved into
the downstairs bedroom...

33:13.526 --> 33:15.626
Yes...'cause she's afraid
to go upstairs and go to sleep.

33:15.628 --> 33:17.095
Really?

33:17.097 --> 33:18.964
Because I did see a woman

33:18.966 --> 33:21.434
who was going from bedroom to bedroom,

33:21.436 --> 33:24.635
trying to get away from him,

33:24.637 --> 33:28.577
and one of the things that I
heard him saying to her was,

33:28.579 --> 33:29.811
"I've got you.

33:29.813 --> 33:32.515
You're mine. There's no escape."

33:32.517 --> 33:37.522
I know he can manipulate the way he's seen.

33:37.524 --> 33:41.224
I saw him at one point coming out as a mist

33:41.226 --> 33:42.926
from under the bed,

33:42.928 --> 33:44.896
coming up to the side of the bed.

33:44.898 --> 33:47.065
There was a female laying in the bed.

33:47.067 --> 33:51.301
He then took on this form
that I saw him with the hat,

33:51.303 --> 33:54.839
and he was pushing down on her shoulders,

33:54.841 --> 33:59.545
and he was saying, uh,
you know, "I've got you.

33:59.547 --> 34:02.750
I smell you. I taste you. I know you."

34:02.752 --> 34:06.520
The impression I got was that
the living woman in the bed

34:06.522 --> 34:08.518
thinks that she's having dreams,

34:08.521 --> 34:10.156
but it's actually happening.

34:10.158 --> 34:12.795
Oh, my God, Amy.

34:12.797 --> 34:15.400
In that bedroom, just like you said,

34:15.402 --> 34:18.638
I was having a dream,
and I'm in a cemetery.

34:18.639 --> 34:22.976
And five monks levitating, hooded,

34:22.978 --> 34:26.449
they come before me, and then they stop.

34:26.451 --> 34:33.830
But this man shot up, huge,
masculine, hat, red eyes.

34:33.831 --> 34:36.630
I felt him just jump right on me,

34:36.632 --> 34:39.601
held me down, and then
when I opened up my eyes,

34:39.603 --> 34:43.772
he's standing right
there, just looking at me.

34:43.774 --> 34:47.909
And he told me that nobody
can help me now, I was his.

34:50.982 --> 34:52.752
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

34:57.423 --> 34:58.323
Ooh.

35:08.367 --> 35:11.772
Yeah. That's him.

35:11.774 --> 35:13.441
Amy, that's him.

35:32.512 --> 35:34.511
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

35:39.185 --> 35:40.084
Ooh.

35:50.130 --> 35:53.532
Yeah. That's him.

35:53.534 --> 35:55.434
Amy, that's him.

35:58.105 --> 36:00.171
That's him.

36:01.374 --> 36:04.175
Oh, my God, Tom.

36:04.177 --> 36:05.776
That's the man I told you about.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.948
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

36:11.950 --> 36:14.519
Then, when he's got a hold on you, Amy,

36:14.521 --> 36:19.325
he doesn't let you go until he decides.

36:19.327 --> 36:21.562
There's no begging. There's no pleading.

36:21.564 --> 36:24.397
The more upset I get,

36:24.399 --> 36:26.698
the more he's enjoying
the cat and mouse game.

36:26.700 --> 36:29.266
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Yeah, that's how he operates.

36:31.937 --> 36:35.006
Now, she wakes up in the morning,

36:35.008 --> 36:36.207
she's got bruises, scratches...

36:36.209 --> 36:40.510
Matter of fact, here's
some of the scratches

36:40.512 --> 36:41.510
we're talking about.

36:43.176 --> 36:46.012
Oh, wow.

36:48.182 --> 36:50.515
Now, is this thing capable of causing this?

36:50.517 --> 36:52.049
Sure, yes. Oh, yes.

36:57.054 --> 36:59.156
- This guy was alive at one time?
- Yes.

36:59.158 --> 37:01.259
Do you know anything about
him or who he might be or...

37:01.261 --> 37:04.565
Yeah. He was probably
about in his 60s or 70s.

37:04.567 --> 37:07.839
He was absolutely in a power position

37:07.841 --> 37:11.911
where he was able to judge others

37:11.913 --> 37:14.514
and had the power to control,
like, their destinies.

37:14.516 --> 37:18.387
He did terrible things throughout his life.

37:18.389 --> 37:20.926
He is attached to the property,

37:20.928 --> 37:24.295
and I think where I saw him
coming up out of the grave

37:24.297 --> 37:25.631
is relatively close.

37:25.633 --> 37:30.399
He was buried near here.

37:32.568 --> 37:35.167
Well, I got to think about
this one a little bit,

37:35.169 --> 37:38.066
but the original guy that owned
the place was a wealthy guy.

37:38.068 --> 37:41.032
Um, his name was John Digges.

37:41.034 --> 37:43.269
As a matter of fact, I have a map here

37:43.271 --> 37:45.502
which was originally called Digges' Choice.

37:45.504 --> 37:46.868
Now, this is 10,000 acres here.

37:46.870 --> 37:47.937
Oh, my goodness.

37:47.939 --> 37:51.443
Your property is right about here.

37:51.445 --> 37:55.180
It goes back to the early 1700s.

37:55.182 --> 37:58.815
This guy was granted
this... this land.

37:58.817 --> 38:02.986
So, he was a powerful guy and ruthless,

38:02.988 --> 38:04.553
you know, in the way he did his business.

38:04.555 --> 38:07.956
When people tried to encroach
on his property and settle,

38:07.958 --> 38:11.593
he forcibly either removed them
from his property at gunpoint,

38:11.595 --> 38:13.598
or he made them pay.

38:13.600 --> 38:18.171
Later on, in 1752, there was
a family called Kitzmillers

38:18.173 --> 38:19.742
that landed on the property,

38:19.744 --> 38:22.646
and he sent his son, Dudley, to
try to intimidate these people.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.416
And a fight ensued over a gun,

38:24.418 --> 38:26.485
and the son, Dudley, was shot and killed.

38:26.487 --> 38:31.155
So, for John Digges,
after his son gets killed,

38:31.157 --> 38:33.258
uh, basically, things go from bad to worse.

38:33.260 --> 38:35.995
Once this case goes to court,

38:35.997 --> 38:40.099
the judge acquits the
Kitzmiller kid for the murder,

38:40.101 --> 38:43.467
and then tells John Digges, "Guess what,

38:43.469 --> 38:45.137
most of this land here is not yours,"

38:45.139 --> 38:46.804
and winds up taking it away from him.

38:46.806 --> 38:50.538
He ended up broken and broke, basically.

38:50.540 --> 38:52.306
Now, we don't know where he's buried,

38:52.308 --> 38:54.742
but I know the son, Dudley,
was buried on the property.

38:54.744 --> 38:56.743
Yeah, that is interesting. Okay.

38:58.813 --> 39:00.315
So, what does he want?

39:00.317 --> 39:05.454
His one main goal is to
go after the women here.

39:05.456 --> 39:08.159
He said, "I'll go after their kids.

39:08.161 --> 39:10.263
- I'll go after their husbands."
- Hmm.

39:12.266 --> 39:16.572
He likes to, like, drive
them to, basically, madness.

39:17.974 --> 39:23.983
The end goal is to actually have a death.

39:23.985 --> 39:26.552
Oh, my gosh.

39:28.751 --> 39:31.221
So, this Lydia Small thing,
with all these kids that died,

39:31.223 --> 39:33.827
I mean, do you think this thing
had anything to do with that?

39:33.829 --> 39:36.695
Yes. I think so, mm-hmm.

39:36.697 --> 39:38.296
Is he trying to kill her?

39:41.033 --> 39:42.498
Yes.

39:51.842 --> 39:53.643
For years, you guys have been in a fight

39:53.645 --> 39:55.879
against something you can't
even see, but, you know,

39:55.881 --> 39:57.714
after our investigation,
at least now you know

39:57.716 --> 39:59.149
who and what you're up against.

39:59.151 --> 40:02.320
But we still haven't
answered your big question...

40:02.322 --> 40:04.554
Is this a fight you guys can win?

40:04.556 --> 40:06.457
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

40:11.931 --> 40:14.065
So, the first thing that needs to happen

40:14.067 --> 40:18.039
is a male witch who's also a medium

40:18.041 --> 40:20.173
needs to be called in here.

40:20.175 --> 40:24.277
This person needs to be
a very dominant male type,

40:24.279 --> 40:25.580
the bigger, the better.

40:27.384 --> 40:29.254
Why does he have to be physically big?

40:29.256 --> 40:36.001
Because he's intimidated
by males who are masculine.

40:38.168 --> 40:41.606
So, day one, this witch needs to come in,

40:41.608 --> 40:45.913
and he needs to call all
of the dead women to him.

40:45.915 --> 40:50.287
And then, he and these dead women

40:50.289 --> 40:55.461
are going to summon the evil dead male.

40:55.463 --> 40:57.798
You cannot be here.

40:57.800 --> 41:03.037
They are going to put him
where needs to be forever,

41:03.039 --> 41:06.506
where he can do no more
harm to anyone ever again.

41:09.476 --> 41:12.911
Day two, he needs to then

41:12.913 --> 41:18.283
assist any of the females
that are dead who want to go.

41:18.285 --> 41:22.555
He's going to assist them
to make that transition.

41:22.557 --> 41:26.393
Day three, he now needs to come down here

41:26.395 --> 41:29.833
and get rid of this
individual in your basement.

41:29.835 --> 41:32.933
Does that banish him just from
here or from the whole area?

41:32.935 --> 41:34.837
Oh, it'll get rid of
him from the whole area.

41:34.839 --> 41:36.206
Yes!

41:36.208 --> 41:38.142
It's a little bit better
news than I was expecting,

41:38.144 --> 41:39.177
to be honest with you.

41:39.179 --> 41:40.380
I feel a lot better,

41:40.382 --> 41:42.349
because it sounds like
a solution's in order.

41:42.351 --> 41:44.187
Oh, relieved.

41:44.189 --> 41:45.389
Are you gonna take Amy's advice?

41:45.391 --> 41:47.056
Yes.

41:47.058 --> 41:49.889
Okay. Absolutely, starting tonight.

41:49.891 --> 41:50.824
Absolutely.

41:53.097 --> 41:55.461
I really hope Deanna
and Tom follow my advice

41:55.463 --> 41:57.962
and rid their home of the
evil that's tormenting them.

41:57.964 --> 42:01.301
I'm worried that if they
don't deal with it immediately,

42:01.303 --> 42:04.136
their suffering could continue,
and they might never find peace.
