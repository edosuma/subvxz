WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:03.274
(Emily) MY FATHER WAS
 AN INNOCENT MAN,

00:03.274 --> 00:05.036
DESTROYED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

00:05.036 --> 00:07.138
THE GRAYSONS ARE BEHIND THIS,
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:07.138 --> 00:10.211
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
 TO AVENGING HIS DEATH.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.612
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S GONNA
FIND YOU OUT.

00:11.612 --> 00:15.386
AND I WON'T STOP UNTIL
 THEY'VE ALL PAID THE PRICE.

00:15.386 --> 00:17.348
LET ME CHOOSE THE "VOULEZ"
 OFFICE LOCATION,

00:17.348 --> 00:20.351
AND I'LL TAKE THE JOB.
 YOU'RE EXACTLY WHAT
I'M LOOKING FOR IN A PUBLISHER.

00:20.351 --> 00:23.224
THE DEED TO NOLAN'S HOUSE
WITH EMILY'S NAME ON IT.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.226
SHE HAS YOUR FORTUNE.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.527
WHO'S NEXT?
 PAUL WHITLEY.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.359
MY FATHER SAW HIM HOLDING
CLOSED-DOOR MEETINGS

00:28.359 --> 00:30.601
WITH EVERYONE WHO EVENTUALLY
BETRAYED HIM.

00:30.601 --> 00:32.463
NOW HE WORKS FOR
AN EVEN HIGHER POWER.

00:32.463 --> 00:35.506
DANIEL AND EMILY HAVE ASKED ME
TO PRESIDE OVER THEIR WEDDING.

00:35.506 --> 00:38.669
(voice breaking) YOU KNEW ABOUT
THE BOMB THAT KILLED DECLAN.

00:38.669 --> 00:41.172
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO FACE
THE PUNISHMENT FOR MY SINS.

00:41.172 --> 00:44.315
I THINK FATHER PAUL CAN
CONVINCE CONRAD TO CONFESS

00:44.315 --> 00:45.316
TO EVERYTHING.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.559
(waves crashing)

00:58.559 --> 01:01.192
(wind howling)

01:01.192 --> 01:05.796
SOME BELIEVE CONFESSION HELPS
 A GUILTY SOUL FIND PEACE...

01:09.270 --> 01:13.204
RELEASING US FROM THE SHAME
 AND REGRET OF OUR MISTAKES.

01:20.111 --> 01:23.554
IN THE FACE OF MORTALITY,
 MANY FEEL THE NEED

01:23.554 --> 01:28.159
TO SEEK THIS CLOSURE
 TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

01:33.224 --> 01:36.167
(wind continues howling)

01:36.167 --> 01:40.100
BECAUSE IF DEATH DOESN'T
 KILL US...

01:40.100 --> 01:42.203
OUR DEMONS WILL.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.474
CHARLOTTE.

01:43.474 --> 01:46.707
THIS IS FOR MY FATHER.

01:48.409 --> 01:51.242
(gasps)

01:51.242 --> 01:53.144
PASTRIES?

01:53.144 --> 01:55.886
YOU SEEM TO BE HAVING
A BAD DREAM.

01:55.886 --> 02:01.121
YEAH... AN ONGOING ONE
FROM WHICH I HAVE YET TO WAKE.
 (liquid pouring)

02:01.121 --> 02:04.325
YOU WERE CRYING OUT
FOR CHARLOTTE.
 WAS I?

02:04.325 --> 02:06.457
WELL, MY MEDICATIONS TEND
TO GIVE ME NIGHTMARES,

02:06.457 --> 02:08.829
THAT IS WHEN I'M ACTUALLY
ABLE TO SLEEP.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.202
SOUNDS LIKE THE SIDE EFFECTS
OF A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

02:11.202 --> 02:14.465
DANIEL SENDS HIS LOVE.
HE'S BEEN MEANING TO STOP BY.

02:14.465 --> 02:18.239
YES, WELL, I UNDERSTAND
WHY MY CHILDREN DON'T VISIT.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.471
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT
ANY EASIER.

02:20.471 --> 02:24.275
ON TOP OF WHICH MY ODIOUS WIFE
HAS CHOSEN TO MOVE IN

02:24.275 --> 02:28.349
ONE CHILD OF HERS
I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT.

02:28.349 --> 02:31.682
ISN'T THERE ANYONE THAT
YOU CAN REACH OUT TO...

02:31.682 --> 02:34.655
TO HELP YOU THROUGH THIS?

02:34.655 --> 02:37.328
ALL THE RELATIONS
I'VE SPENT MY LIFE CULTIVATING

02:37.328 --> 02:40.931
AREN'T THE TYPE TO...
CALL ON A FALLEN MOGUL

02:40.931 --> 02:44.935
OR A FAILED GOVERNOR,
LET ALONE A DYING FRIEND.

02:44.935 --> 02:46.267
MY FATHER ALWAYS SAID

02:46.267 --> 02:48.439
THAT YOU CAN ONLY TRULY
COUNT ON FAMILY

02:48.439 --> 02:50.341
IN TIMES OF TRAGEDY.

02:50.341 --> 02:52.503
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND A WAY
TO MAKE AMENDS WITH YOURS

02:52.503 --> 02:54.375
IN THESE FINAL MONTHS
TOGETHER.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.248
MONTHS? (chuckles)

02:57.248 --> 02:58.879
I WAS HOPING FOR YEARS.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.412
(chuckles) OF COURSE.

03:01.412 --> 03:04.215
WE ALL ARE, CONRAD.

03:04.215 --> 03:05.916
(Aiden) WELL, I LOOK FORWARD
TO THE TIME WHEN WE CAN

03:05.916 --> 03:08.389
STOP MEETING ON YACHTS
AND BRIDGES--

03:08.389 --> 03:10.221
ROMANTIC AS IT SEEMS.

03:10.221 --> 03:12.363
I FOUND AN ACCOUNT
IN THE CAYMANS

03:12.363 --> 03:13.924
DEBITED IN THE SAME AMOUNT
AS NOLAN'S HOUSE.

03:13.924 --> 03:15.666
I JUST NEED TO CONFIRM
THE OWNER.

03:15.666 --> 03:17.628
ALL BEING WELL, WE SHOULD
RESTORE YOUR FORTUNE

03:17.628 --> 03:20.271
BY THE WEEK'S END.
 IF EMILY IS A GRIFTER,

03:20.271 --> 03:22.202
AS I'VE LONG SUSPECTED,
SHE'S A VERY CLEVER ONE.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.305
AND I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT SHE WOULD BE SO INDELICATE

03:24.305 --> 03:26.277
AS TO LEAVE A PAPER TRAIL.
 YES, IT IS SUSPICIOUS,

03:26.277 --> 03:27.838
WHICH IS WHY THE SOONER
I'M OUT OF THE SHADOWS

03:27.838 --> 03:30.741
AND BACK IN HER ORBIT,
THE BETTER I CAN...

03:30.741 --> 03:32.283
RATTLE HER.
 AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

03:32.283 --> 03:34.785
THAT SHE WOULD BLINK TWICE
AT SEEING YOU AGAIN?

03:34.785 --> 03:37.348
I MENTIONED THAT
SHE BETRAYED ME.

03:37.348 --> 03:39.420
I DIDN'T TELL YOU HOW.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.292
SHE WAS, UM...

03:41.292 --> 03:44.955
SEEING ME
BEHIND DANIEL'S BACK,

03:44.955 --> 03:47.258
EVEN AFTER
THEY WERE ENGAGED.

03:47.258 --> 03:48.459
I WAS A FOOL TO THINK
THAT SHE'D

03:48.459 --> 03:51.262
WALK AWAY FROM ALL THIS--
FROM THE HAMPTONS.

03:51.262 --> 03:52.933
WELL, IF SHE'S AFTER
OUR MONEY,

03:52.933 --> 03:55.836
THEN WHY THIS CHARADE?

03:55.836 --> 03:58.269
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
SHE LOVES DANIEL.

03:58.269 --> 04:00.811
WELL, PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD BE INVESTIGATING.

04:00.811 --> 04:02.242
TALK TO DANIEL.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.974
DO NOT LET HIM KNOW
YOU'RE ON TO EMILY.

04:03.974 --> 04:07.278
YOU CAN'T TRUST
WHERE HIS ALLEGIANCES LIE.

04:07.278 --> 04:10.321
(footsteps depart)

04:10.321 --> 04:12.523
GIO, I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO BUILD SEA WORLD.

04:12.523 --> 04:13.824
JUST SOME ENCLOSURE
ON THE BEACH WITH,

04:13.824 --> 04:15.286
I DON'T KNOW,
FIVE OR SIX DOLPHINS

04:15.286 --> 04:16.887
FOR PEOPLE TO SWIM WITH.

04:16.887 --> 04:18.389
I SEE YOU'RE SPARING
NO EXPENSE.
 NO. (chuckles)

04:18.389 --> 04:19.760
NOT THAT I WOULD EXPECT
ANYTHING LESS

04:19.760 --> 04:22.433
FOR YOUR HOUSEWARMING.
DID YOU INVITE ALL OF NEW YORK?

04:22.433 --> 04:24.795
NO, I KEPT THE GUEST LIST
AT A HUNDRED TO ENSURE THAT

04:24.795 --> 04:27.498
IT WAS THE MOST EXCLUSIVE EVENT
OF THE SEASON.

04:27.498 --> 04:29.640
AND SOMEBODY'S GOTTA FILL
VICTORIA'S LOUBIES

04:29.640 --> 04:31.942
NOW THAT, UH, SHE'S BROKE

04:31.942 --> 04:33.774
AND SETTLED WITH
A DYING HUSBAND.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.347
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY SHE MOVED
PATRICK INTO THE MANOR.

04:36.347 --> 04:39.279
SHE'S HOPING TO DRIVE CONRAD
TO AN EARLIER GRAVE.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.052
MR. OSBOURNE CAN'T BE
LONG FOR THIS WORLD

04:42.052 --> 04:44.515
AFTER SLAMMING THE DOOR
IN THE FACE OF EMILY THORNE.

04:44.515 --> 04:46.757
CONRAD IS MY SOLE FOCUS
RIGHT NOW.

04:46.757 --> 04:49.460
ALL YOU NEED IS FATHER PAUL
TO ILLICIT A CONFESSION

04:49.460 --> 04:51.362
FROM CONRAD.

04:51.362 --> 04:54.395
HMM, IT'S A PITY HE'S ON
FORCED SABBATICAL IN MAINE

04:54.395 --> 04:56.597
DUE TO THE TAKEDOWN
I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.770
I AM WELL AWARE
THAT I PUNISHED THE WRONG MAN.

04:59.770 --> 05:01.372
I MADE THINGS MORE DIFFICULT
FOR MYSELF.

05:01.372 --> 05:04.435
BUT IF I CAN GET CONRAD
TO CONFESS...

05:04.435 --> 05:08.078
THEN YOU GET WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN AFTER ALL ALONG--

05:08.078 --> 05:09.480
CLEAR YOUR FATHER'S NAME.

05:11.342 --> 05:14.515
I JUST NEVER IMAGINED CONRAD
WOULD BE THE ONE TO DO IT.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.587
WE'RE NOT PUTTING NOLAN
ON THE COVER.

05:16.587 --> 05:19.019
THINK ABOUT IT--
HIS FALL FROM TECH FAME,

05:19.019 --> 05:20.551
HIS TIME IN PRISON,

05:20.551 --> 05:21.852
AND NOW HIS TRIUMPHANT RETURN
TO HAMPTONS SOCIETY--

05:21.852 --> 05:24.595
HE WAS ACCUSED OF TERRORISM.
 FALSELY ACCUSED.

05:24.595 --> 05:26.527
EVEN STILL, WE SHOULDN'T
ASSOCIATE OURSELVES

05:26.527 --> 05:27.558
WITH THAT WHOLE DEBACLE.

05:27.558 --> 05:28.959
LOOK WHAT IT DID
TO MY LAST COMPANY.

05:28.959 --> 05:31.662
OR LOOK WHAT YOUR LAST COMPANY
DID TO NOLAN ROSS.

05:31.662 --> 05:33.834
HE'S YET TO GRANT ANYONE
AN INTERVIEW.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.666
WHAT IF THERE IS
A BIGGER STORY TO COME OUT

05:35.666 --> 05:37.708
ABOUT WHY HE WAS ACCUSED?

05:37.708 --> 05:40.110
LET'S JUST SEE WHAT ELSE
IS OUT THERE, OKAY?

05:40.110 --> 05:44.615
APOLOGIES IF YOU MISINTERPRETED
MY ATTEMPT TO SEDUCE YOU

05:44.615 --> 05:47.878
AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS,
BUT I AM EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.

05:47.878 --> 05:49.950
I PUT WHO I WISH
ON THE COVER.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.582
NOW I'D APPRECIATE IF YOU WOULD
GET ME ON THE LIST

05:51.582 --> 05:54.054
FOR NOLAN'S PARTY TOMORROW,
SO I MAY SEE HIM IN HIS ELEMENT.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.056
I WASN'T INVITED.
 NO, BUT EMILY WAS.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.958
BUT MAYBE I SHOULD ASK HER?

05:57.958 --> 05:59.390
OKAY, LOOK,
I'LL RUN THE IDEA BY NOLAN,

05:59.390 --> 06:00.731
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'LL BE INTERESTED.

06:00.731 --> 06:02.032
CAN WE LEAVE IT AT THAT?

06:04.635 --> 06:06.897
I SPENT THE LAST SIX DAYS

06:06.897 --> 06:09.640
IN PRAYER ASKING GOD
WHY THIS HAS HAPPENED.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.772
(men chanting)

06:11.772 --> 06:14.505
I KNOW EVERYONE THINKS
I'M GUILTY, BUT I WAS FRAMED.

06:14.505 --> 06:19.510
THESE QUESTIONS YOU'RE ASKING--
DO THEY MATTER?

06:19.510 --> 06:22.953
WAS IT NOT GOD'S WILL?

06:22.953 --> 06:26.086
TO MOVE FORWARD,
YOU MUST LOOK INWARD.

06:26.086 --> 06:29.820
THANK YOU, BROTHER.

06:29.820 --> 06:33.664
(chanting continues)

06:33.664 --> 06:36.667
(door opens and closes)

06:39.770 --> 06:41.972
(curtain rings rattle)

06:41.972 --> 06:45.706
FORGIVE ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

06:45.706 --> 06:49.039
(Emily)
TRUST ME, I'M WELL AWARE.

06:49.039 --> 06:53.183
AND I'M WILLING
TO GIVE YOU MY FORGIVENESS--

06:53.183 --> 06:56.517
SOMETHING I'VE NEVER
GIVEN ANYONE.

06:56.517 --> 07:09.159
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO EARN IT.

07:12.703 --> 07:14.164
IF YOU ARE THE RIGHTEOUS MAN
I SUSPECT YOU TO BE,

07:14.164 --> 07:16.607
IF YOU'RE TRUE TO YOUR VOWS,

07:16.607 --> 07:20.471
THEN YOU'RE REQUIRED TO KEEP
MY CONFIDENCE, IS THAT NOT TRUE?

07:20.471 --> 07:22.543
I'M BOUND BY THE SACRAMENT.
 GOOD.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.645
BECAUSE I KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
FATHER.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.017
I KNOW YOU WERE INVOLVED
IN THE DAVID CLARKE SCANDAL

07:27.017 --> 07:28.448
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.480
(lowered voice) YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT FRAMED ME.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.222
I WANTED TO MAKE YOU SUFFER...

07:32.222 --> 07:34.154
THE SAME WAY
THAT DAVID CLARKE DID.

07:36.857 --> 07:40.060
BUT I REALIZED TOO LATE...

07:40.060 --> 07:41.932
I WAS WRONG TO PUNISH YOU.

07:41.932 --> 07:42.933
WHO ARE YOU?

07:42.933 --> 07:46.567
EMILY THORNE.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.139
AMANDA CLARKE WAS MY FRIEND.

07:49.139 --> 07:50.701
SHE KNEW WHAT CONRAD DID
TO HER FATHER--

07:50.701 --> 07:52.242
ONE OF HIS MANY SINS.

07:52.242 --> 07:57.878
I WANT YOU TO PERSUADE HIM
TO CONFESS... TO THE WORLD.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.880
IF YOU DO,
I WILL CLEAR YOUR NAME

07:59.880 --> 08:02.052
SO YOU CAN GO BACK
TO HELPING THE INNOCENT.

08:02.052 --> 08:04.154
BUT IF YOU DON'T,
I WILL EXPOSE YOU

08:04.154 --> 08:07.117
FOR THE SIN YOU SHOULD HAVE
PAID FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE.

08:07.117 --> 08:11.261
PACK YOUR BAGS.
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

08:12.963 --> 08:15.495
AND THEN WHAT?

08:36.717 --> 08:39.750
(Victoria) THE THINGS THAT YOU
LIVE TO REGRET.
 (Patrick chuckles)

08:39.750 --> 08:41.520
OH, IT'S SUCH A SHAME
WE HAD TO SELL

08:41.520 --> 08:42.793
OUR EUROPEAN HOMES

08:42.793 --> 08:44.224
BEFORE YOU EVER GOT A CHANCE
TO SEE THEM.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.256
A SILVER LINING,

08:46.256 --> 08:48.599
BEING THAT MY ART COLLECTIONS'S
COME HOME.
 (vehicle approaching
in distance)

08:48.599 --> 08:50.130
THESE ARE
THE CHAGALL SKETCHES, RIGHT?

08:50.130 --> 08:52.262
OH! DON'T--LET'S WAIT
TO VIEW THEM TOGETHER

08:52.262 --> 08:53.564
AFTER I COME BACK
FROM DANIEL'S.

08:53.564 --> 08:54.665
OKAY.

08:54.665 --> 08:57.568
YOU FOOL.

08:57.568 --> 09:00.540
YOU DO REMEMBER THAT THE DOCTORS
REVOKED YOUR LICENSE.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.143
A TESTAROSSA REPRESENTS
MY "SALAD DAYS."

09:03.143 --> 09:04.815
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS, PATRICK?

09:04.815 --> 09:07.317
I TRUST THEY HAD SHAKESPEARE
IN CLEVELAND?

09:07.317 --> 09:08.879
DID HE PLAY FOR THE INDIANS?
 "MY SALAD DAYS--

09:08.879 --> 09:11.952
WHEN I WAS GREEN IN JUDGMENT
AND COLD IN BLOOD,"

09:11.952 --> 09:14.725
SOMETHING WITH WHICH
I'M SURE YOU ARE FAMILIAR.

09:14.725 --> 09:16.226
SO NOW I'LL FEEL FREE
TO SETTLE ALONG

09:16.226 --> 09:17.858
WITH THE REST
OF MY HAPPINESS.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.060
NOT THAT MY HAPPINESS HAS EVER
BEEN WORTH ANYTHING TO YOU.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.833
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SNAP.
I WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.595
OH, LIKE HELL YOU WERE.

09:24.595 --> 09:26.166
I'M BETTING YOU DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW I WAS OUT OF BED.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.039
SO STOP PUTTING ON AIRS
FOR YOUR UNCTUOUS SON.

09:30.871 --> 09:34.344
SO THIS IS THE STOWAWAY--
MY TEMPORARY HOME. (chuckles)

09:34.344 --> 09:36.146
YOU LIVE AT A BAR?

09:36.146 --> 09:38.649
I THOUGHT I WAS DESPERATE
TO ESCAPE MY FAMILY.

09:38.649 --> 09:41.351
WELL, JACK AND CARL
ARE MY FAMILY, ACTUALLY.

09:41.351 --> 09:44.785
ET PUISQUE MA FAMILLE
 C'EST TA FAMILLE...

09:44.785 --> 09:48.118
I CAN SEE YOUR TIME IN FRANCE
DIDN'T MUCH IMPROVE YOUR ACCENT.

09:48.118 --> 09:50.220
(both laugh)

09:50.220 --> 09:52.863
HEY, JACK,
COME MEET MARGAUX.

09:52.863 --> 09:55.165
SHE JUST MOVED HER MAGAZINE
DOWN THE ROAD.

09:55.165 --> 09:57.267
HI.
 HI.

09:57.267 --> 09:59.369
IF YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT,
IT COULD MEAN BIG BUSINESS.

09:59.369 --> 10:02.973
MM, IF WE EVER GET OFF
THE GROUND. (chuckles)

10:02.973 --> 10:05.235
UM, I DON'T MEAN TO BE
A SNOOP,

10:05.235 --> 10:07.077
BUT ARE YOU GOING
TO THAT PARTY?

10:07.077 --> 10:09.710
(Charlotte) NOLAN IS ONE
OF HIS BEST FRIENDS.
 REALLY?

10:09.710 --> 10:10.841
♪♪♪

10:10.841 --> 10:13.884
WELL, IF YOU ARE LOOKING
FOR A PLUS ONE...

10:13.884 --> 10:15.816
(scoffs) I WASN'T PLANNING
ON GOING, ACTUALLY.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.018
JACK! YOU HAVE TO.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.290
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
YOU GOT OUT?

10:20.290 --> 10:21.992
AND MARGAUX'S NEW IN TOWN.
SHE NEEDS TO MEET NEW PEOPLE.

10:21.992 --> 10:23.253
YOU'D BE DOING HER
A FAVOR.

10:23.253 --> 10:25.625
A RATHER HUGE ONE, ACTUALLY.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.799
I'M NOT REALLY LOOKING
TO DATE RIGHT NOW.

10:28.799 --> 10:30.300
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT DATING?

10:30.300 --> 10:33.664
YOU CAN PICK ME UP AT 6:00.

10:33.664 --> 10:35.265
(indistinct conversations)

10:35.265 --> 10:39.940
OH, THERE HE IS--
MY HARDWORKING BOY.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.171
YOU KNOW,
WORK'S WHAT PEOPLE DO

10:41.171 --> 10:43.173
WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

10:43.173 --> 10:46.146
(chuckles)

10:46.146 --> 10:48.719
WHY ARE YOU HERE LATE
AND NOT WITH YOUR FIANCéE?

10:48.719 --> 10:51.081
SHE JUST CALLED TO SAY
SHE WAS SLEEPING IN THE CITY.

10:51.081 --> 10:54.154
AH. WHAT IS SHE UP TO?
 I DIDN'T ASK.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.285
WELL, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD.

10:55.285 --> 10:57.157
AN ENGAGEMENT IS TIME
TO ASK QUESTIONS.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.960
YOU DON'T WANT TO FIND
YOURSELF MARRYING A STRANGER.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.331
EMILY'S HARDLY
A STRANGER.

11:01.331 --> 11:03.663
OH, I'M NOT SO SURE.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.867
DID YOU KNOW THAT SHE BOUGHT
NOLAN ROSS' NEW HOME?

11:06.867 --> 11:09.700
AND WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

11:09.700 --> 11:11.271
A FRIEND OF MINE
IN REAL ESTATE.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.443
SO CLEARLY
YOU DON'T KNOW EMILY

11:13.443 --> 11:14.875
QUITE AS WELL
AS YOU THINK YOU DO.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.106
OTHERWISE, YOU WOULDN'T
BE HARBORING

11:16.106 --> 11:17.748
THE $10 MILLION SECRET.

11:17.748 --> 11:21.051
WELL, IF IT'S TRUE, I'M SURE
SHE HAS A PERFECTLY GOOD REASON.

11:21.051 --> 11:23.814
SHE'S NOT INTENTIONALLY
KEEPING THINGS FROM ME.

11:23.814 --> 11:26.056
REALLY?

11:26.056 --> 11:29.359
NOT EVEN HER PAST
WITH AIDEN MATHIS?

11:29.359 --> 11:31.391
WHAT ABOUT HIM?
 (device thuds)

11:31.391 --> 11:33.824
SWEETHEART, WERE YOU AWARE
THAT EVEN AFTER YOU ASKED

11:33.824 --> 11:36.797
FOR HER HAND IN MARRIAGE,
SHE WAS SLEEPING WITH HIM?

11:36.797 --> 11:40.270
(chuckles) WHO TOLD YOU THAT,
YOUR REAL ESTATE AGENT?

11:40.270 --> 11:42.172
WHY THE HELL ARE YOU
BRINGING AIDEN UP NOW?

11:42.172 --> 11:43.373
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO YOUR MARRYING

11:43.373 --> 11:45.205
BECAUSE, APPARENTLY,
YOU HAVE NO INTENTION TO.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.336
YOU KNOW,
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS,

11:46.336 --> 11:47.878
YOU COULDN'T HAVE GIVEN
A DAMN ABOUT

11:47.878 --> 11:51.011
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH EMILY.
SO WHY THE RENEWED PARANOIA?

11:51.011 --> 11:53.083
HMM?

11:53.083 --> 11:56.446
YEAH, IT SEEMS SHE'S NOT
THE ONLY ONE KEEPING SECRETS.

11:56.446 --> 11:58.989
NOW AS FAR AS AIDEN MATHIS
IS CONCERNED,

11:58.989 --> 12:01.822
HE'S NOT COMING AROUND ANYMORE,
I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.455
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR WORK.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.731
(cell phone beeps,
line rings)

12:11.731 --> 12:15.335
YOU WISHED FOR YOUR ENTRéE
BACK INTO SOCIETY, MR. MATHIS?

12:15.335 --> 12:16.967
IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE TOMORROW,

12:16.967 --> 12:19.309
I THINK I HAVE
THE PERFECT VENUE.

12:23.143 --> 12:26.146
(chuckles) NO.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.949
LOOK, TELL BATALI NOT
TO SKIMP IN THE RAW BAR.

12:28.949 --> 12:32.052
IF HE WANTS TO COOK SOMETHING,
HE TOOK THE WRONG GIG.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.025
NOW, SO NOW, WHAT'S THE, UM,
DOLPHIN UPDATE?

12:35.025 --> 12:38.158
GOD, I KNEW P.E.T.A. WOULD
GET INVOLVED. (chuckles)
 HEY!

12:39.159 --> 12:42.262
NO PHONES.
 SORRY. NEW HERE.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.534
DOES THE SAME GO
FOR PORPOISES?

12:44.534 --> 12:46.797
YOU'RE NEW TO THE CLUB
OR THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE?

12:48.538 --> 12:51.271
SORRY. LET ME CALL YOU BACK.
 (cell phone beeps and clatters)

12:51.271 --> 12:54.074
I WAS JUST PLANNING
MY HOUSEWARMING.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.876
I HEARD.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.248
WE ALL HEARD.
I ALSO KNOW YOUR HEAD COUNT,

12:58.248 --> 12:59.880
THE FACT THAT
YOUR PARTY PLANNER

12:59.880 --> 13:01.081
KICKED YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE
FOR MICROMANAGING, AND RIGHT NOW

13:01.081 --> 13:03.413
THEY'RE DECHLORINATING YOUR POOL
FOR THE SWANS.

13:03.413 --> 13:06.116
(scoffs) HOPE NOBODY
PLANS ON SWIMMING.

13:06.116 --> 13:09.019
SWANS ARE FILTHY ANIMALS.
 (chuckles)

13:09.019 --> 13:11.461
DIDN'T REALIZE ANYONE
WAS LISTENING.

13:11.461 --> 13:13.193
WELL, IT'S HARD TO TUNE OUT
NOLAN ROSS.

13:14.394 --> 13:18.298
(chuckles) HE KNOWS MY NAME.
OH, WELL...

13:18.298 --> 13:20.130
LET ME MAKE UP
FOR THE DISTURBANCE.

13:20.130 --> 13:21.401
I'LL COVER YOUR TAB.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.573
(chuckles) THANKS. NO NEED.

13:23.573 --> 13:28.278
WELL, MAYBE I CAN OFFER YOU
SOMETHING MONEY CAN'T BUY--

13:28.278 --> 13:30.240
PUT YOU ON THE LIST
FOR MY PARTY.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.013
I AM CURIOUS TO SEE
HOW SOMEBODY BLOWS

13:33.013 --> 13:34.084
$2 MIL ON ONE EVENING.

13:34.084 --> 13:37.017
(chuckles)
 YOUR NEGRONI.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.489
THANK YOU.
 (glasses clink)

13:39.489 --> 13:41.451
LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED
ANYTHING ELSE, MR. GRAYSON.

13:41.451 --> 13:45.956
IT'S OSBOURNE,
BUT I'M ON THE GRAYSON TAB.
 YES, SIR.

13:45.956 --> 13:49.930
UH, I'M--I'M SORRY.
I... WHAT'S YOUR NAME...

13:49.930 --> 13:51.561
FOR THE LIST?
 PATRICK.

13:51.561 --> 13:54.564
PATRICK...
 OSBOURNE, RIGHT.

13:54.564 --> 13:56.066
GOT IT. (chuckles)

13:56.066 --> 13:59.169
(indistinct conversations)

13:59.169 --> 14:02.172
(light jazz music playing)

14:03.213 --> 14:05.976
(sea birds call)

14:08.448 --> 14:10.450
(footsteps approaching)

14:10.450 --> 14:12.152
DANIEL.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.583
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
AT WORK.

14:13.583 --> 14:16.056
WHERE WERE YOU YESTERDAY?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.627
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I TOLD YOU,
I STAYED IN THE CITY.

14:17.627 --> 14:19.559
YEAH, WHAT WERE YOU
DOING THERE?
 WHY?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.461
(keys clatter)
 BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE KEEPING
THINGS FROM ME, THAT'S WHY.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.894
IS IT TRUE YOU BOUGHT NOLAN
HIS HOUSE?

14:23.894 --> 14:25.095
(keys jangle)
 YEAH.

14:25.095 --> 14:27.037
NOLAN'S MY FRIEND,
AND HE NEEDED MY HELP.

14:27.037 --> 14:30.200
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
BECAUSE... HE WAS ASHAMED.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.172
SO YOU GAVE HIM
A $10 MILLION LOAN?

14:32.172 --> 14:34.204
WOW, WE SET A DATE,
AND SUDDENLY YOU CARE

14:34.204 --> 14:37.007
HOW I SPEND MY TIME,
MY MONEY.

14:37.007 --> 14:39.149
WHAT'S NEXT, DANIEL,
WHO I TALK TO?
 MAYBE.

14:39.149 --> 14:40.650
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW AIDEN?

14:42.953 --> 14:45.986
WHAT?
 MY MOTHER SAID YOU WERE
SEEING HIM BEHIND MY BACK,

14:45.986 --> 14:48.358
EVEN AFTER WE GOT ENGAGED.

14:48.358 --> 14:50.220
(huffs)

14:50.220 --> 14:53.163
AND WHO GAVE HER THAT IDEA?
 DOES IT MATTER?
I'M TELLING YOU, RIGHT NOW

14:53.163 --> 14:56.366
I AM NOT GOING DOWN
THIS PATH AGAIN WITH YOU, EMILY.
 AND WE WON'T.

14:56.366 --> 14:59.329
WHAT I HAD WITH AIDEN
WAS FLEETING AND LONG BEFORE US,

14:59.329 --> 15:01.371
BUT, OBVIOUSLY, FACTS ARE
IRRELEVANT TO YOUR MOTHER.

15:01.371 --> 15:03.633
SHE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE HOUSE.
 OKAY, I'M SORRY.

15:03.633 --> 15:06.536
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT.

15:06.536 --> 15:09.309
(inhales deeply)

15:09.309 --> 15:12.542
LOOK... WE BOTH KNOW
HER GOAL IS TO BLOW US APART.

15:12.542 --> 15:15.485
I JUST WISH YOU WOULDN'T GIVE
HER ANY AMMUNITION TO DO IT.

15:15.485 --> 15:16.987
(knock on door)

15:16.987 --> 15:21.221
(chuckles) DANNY,
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE AT WORK.

15:21.221 --> 15:24.324
HE WEARS HIS SHAME WELL.

15:24.324 --> 15:27.527
I LOOK FORWARD TO CHECKING OUT
YOUR NEW PLACE LATER.

15:30.060 --> 15:33.533
WHAT DID I JUST WALK INTO?
 NOT EXACTLY SURE.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.236
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

15:36.236 --> 15:38.308
OUT EXPLORING
THE NEIGHBORHOOD, UH,

15:38.308 --> 15:40.010
MEETING NEIGHBORS.

15:40.010 --> 15:43.173
I KIND OF RAN INTO PATRICK,
WHO IS NOW...

15:43.173 --> 15:45.075
KIND OF COMING TO MY PARTY.

15:45.075 --> 15:46.376
WHAT?

15:46.376 --> 15:49.249
WELL, IF HE DOES DECIDE TO COME,
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.121
WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH
ABOUT HIM YET.

15:51.121 --> 15:54.354
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO TODAY?

15:54.354 --> 15:58.658
I OWE CONRAD ONE LAST VISIT
BEFORE FATHER PAUL LANDS.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.330
(whispers) OH.

16:00.330 --> 16:02.662
(boat motors rumble,
buoy bell clanging)

16:02.662 --> 16:05.165
IT'S OKAY.
 (fussing)

16:05.165 --> 16:07.197
YEAH.

16:07.197 --> 16:09.599
YOU CAN SET UP OVER THERE.

16:09.599 --> 16:11.041
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

16:11.041 --> 16:13.073
WHAT'S THIS?
 IF YOU'RE TO GO OUT
WITH MARGAUX,

16:13.073 --> 16:14.744
YOU CAN'T WEAR A HOODIE
OR ANYTHING FLANNEL.

16:14.744 --> 16:16.306
SO I BROUGHT A TAILOR
TO FIT A SUIT FOR YOU.

16:16.306 --> 16:18.108
I NEVER EVEN AGREED
TO GO OUT WITH HER.

16:18.108 --> 16:19.709
AND I HAVE MY OWN SUIT.
I HAVE TWO OF THEM.

16:19.709 --> 16:23.153
BOTH ASSOCIATED
WITH PAINFUL MEMORIES.

16:23.153 --> 16:25.485
WHICH IS WHY YOU NEED ANOTHER
FOR NEW EXPERIENCES.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.058
JACK, YOU HELPED ME
BY OPENING MY EYES

16:28.058 --> 16:30.120
TO THE TRUTH
ABOUT MY FATHER.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.123
SO I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

16:33.123 --> 16:35.725
HELP ME WHAT?
 SEE THAT YOU STOPPED LIVING.

16:35.725 --> 16:38.398
YOU TAKE CARE OF CARL
AND THE BAR, BUT...
 (sighs)

16:38.398 --> 16:39.769
NOT YOURSELF.

16:39.769 --> 16:41.771
AMANDA WOULD WANT YOU
TO ENJOY LIFE.

16:41.771 --> 16:43.233
SO WOULD DECLAN.

16:43.233 --> 16:44.674
YOU KNOW WHAT
HE SAID TO ME ONCE?

16:44.674 --> 16:46.476
HE SAID,
"A SHIP IS SAFE IN HARBOR,

16:46.476 --> 16:48.778
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY SHIPS
WERE BUILT."

16:51.211 --> 16:53.643
I BET HE TOLD YOU
HE MADE THAT UP.

16:53.643 --> 16:55.215
HE DIDN'T.
 (chuckles)

16:55.215 --> 16:58.588
(chuckles) REGARDLESS,
YOU NEED TO GET OUT.

16:58.588 --> 17:00.490
AND THE BEAUTY OF GOING
WITH MARGAUX

17:00.490 --> 17:03.022
IS SHE DOESN'T KNOW
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.455
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

17:06.455 --> 17:08.657
BUT I'M MEASURING
MY OWN INSEAM.

17:12.602 --> 17:16.165
IT'S LOVELY, BIANCA,
THANK YOU.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.667
(sighs)
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?
SHOULD WE, UH...

17:18.667 --> 17:20.170
WAIT FOR CONRAD?

17:20.170 --> 17:22.811
UGH, WHO KNOWS WHAT
HORRID MOOD HE'LL BE IN TODAY,

17:22.811 --> 17:25.345
OR IF HE EVEN HAS
AN APPETITE AT ALL?

17:25.345 --> 17:28.478
YOU MUST BE WORRIED
ABOUT HIM.

17:28.478 --> 17:31.151
WELL, WHAT WORRIES ME
IS THE UNKNOWN.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.783
BUT HAVING YOU AT MY SIDE MAKES
THE WORLD SEEM LESS DAUNTING.

17:33.783 --> 17:36.386
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOUR LUNCH.

17:36.386 --> 17:39.389
OH, PATRICK,
I BELIEVE YOU KNOW...
 WE'VE MET...

17:39.389 --> 17:40.790
ONE TIME TOO MANY.

17:40.790 --> 17:42.462
HMM.

17:42.462 --> 17:45.735
I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO SEE CONRAD,
BUT I WANTED TO DELIVER THIS.

17:45.735 --> 17:47.297
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
HAND-DELIVERING

17:47.297 --> 17:49.068
ALL 400 WEDDING INVITATIONS?

17:49.068 --> 17:52.142
SURELY YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
FOR POSTAGE.

17:52.142 --> 17:53.343
ACTUALLY, IT'S FOR
NOLAN'S HOUSEWARMING.

17:53.343 --> 17:55.775
HE WANTED TO INCLUDE
ALL THE NEIGHBORS, SO...

17:55.775 --> 17:58.348
OH, HOW SWEET. BUT I'VE NEVER
NEEDED AN INVITE

17:58.348 --> 18:00.710
TO ATTEND ANY FUNCTION
IN THE HAMPTONS.

18:00.710 --> 18:02.712
OH, CONRAD AWAITS.

18:02.712 --> 18:05.815
WHO KNEW YOU TO BE
SUCH A FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE?

18:05.815 --> 18:08.558
OH, THERE'S SO MUCH YOU DON'T
KNOW ABOUT ME, VICTORIA.

18:08.558 --> 18:10.820
OH, I'M LEARNING
MORE AND MORE EACH DAY.

18:10.820 --> 18:13.563
HMM. NOLAN'S LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEEING YOU LATER, PATRICK.

18:13.563 --> 18:15.595
EXCUSE ME.

18:18.228 --> 18:21.601
UH, I MET HIM EARLIER,

18:21.601 --> 18:24.204
AND, UH, HE ASKED ME
TO DROP BY.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.236
OH.

18:26.236 --> 18:28.778
PATRICK,
UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES,

18:28.778 --> 18:31.441
I WOULD NEVER TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO OR WHO TO SEE.

18:31.441 --> 18:34.544
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MR. ROSS
AND MISS THORNE--
 BELIEVE ME,

18:34.544 --> 18:36.546
I DIDN'T REALIZE THEY WERE
FRIENDS UNTIL JUST NOW.

18:36.546 --> 18:40.650
WELL, THEY ARE,
AND THEY'RE THICK AS THIEVES.

18:40.650 --> 18:42.652
STILL NO WORD FROM CHARLOTTE?

18:42.652 --> 18:44.424
WELL, I PHONED.

18:44.424 --> 18:47.727
AND YESTERDAY I DROVE OUT
TO THE STOWAWAY TO SEE HER,

18:47.727 --> 18:49.759
BUT THEN I THOUGHT
BETTER OF IT.

18:49.759 --> 18:51.231
AH, I THOUGHT
OF WRITING HER A LETTER,

18:51.231 --> 18:53.603
BUT I COULDN'T...
(strained voice) HOLD THE PEN.

18:53.603 --> 18:55.235
WOULD YOU MIND?

18:55.235 --> 18:57.607
WELL, IF YOU WANT,
I'LL WRITE IT FOR YOU.

18:57.607 --> 19:02.212
NO. PERHAPS IT'S BEST
THAT... SHE STAYS AWAY.

19:02.212 --> 19:05.545
I MEAN, I WATCHED THIS DISEASE
DEVOUR MY GRANDFATHER.
 (pills rattle)

19:05.545 --> 19:08.418
IT COULD BE AS HARD TO WATCH
AS IT IS TO SUFFER.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.881
(mouth full) MM.

19:11.881 --> 19:15.685
YOU SAID YOU FELT
THAT YOU WERE BEING

19:15.685 --> 19:18.228
PUNISHED FOR YOUR SINS.

19:18.228 --> 19:19.929
I NEVER KNEW YOU WERE
A RELIGIOUS MAN.

19:19.929 --> 19:22.632
(chuckles)
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.

19:24.564 --> 19:28.298
MY FATHER USED TO READ
ME STORIES FROM THE BIBLE.

19:28.298 --> 19:30.169
I WAS ALWAYS DRAWN
TO THE OLD TESTAMENT--

19:30.169 --> 19:32.902
GOD--THE ONE WHO AVENGES.

29:46.515 --> 29:48.988
YOUR FRIEND EMILY
SENT YOU THERE TO SUSS ME OUT,

29:48.988 --> 29:50.820
DIDN'T SHE, AFTER SHE TRIED
AND FAILED LAST WEEK?

29:50.820 --> 29:53.322
WAIT, WHAT? (scoffs)

29:53.322 --> 29:56.325
NO, I HAD NO IDEA
WHO YOU WERE, TRUST ME.

29:56.325 --> 29:58.097
MY MOTHER WARNED ME
 NOT TO TRUST YOU.

29:58.097 --> 30:00.970
AND YET... HERE YOU ARE.

30:00.970 --> 30:03.372
WELL, I LIKE TO DRAW
MY OWN CONCLUSIONS.

30:03.372 --> 30:07.076
CLEARLY MY MOTHER AND EMILY
HAVE THEIR... ISSUES.

30:07.076 --> 30:08.137
THE THING IS I DON'T CARE.

WHAT HAPPENED WITH CONRAD?

30:47.116 --> 30:48.277
Well, as you know,

30:48.277 --> 30:50.579
I protect those
who confide in me.

30:50.579 --> 30:52.421
BUT YOU CAN HAVE FAITH.
I DID AS YOU ASKED.

30:52.421 --> 30:54.523
I'M SHORT OF FAITH
THESE DAYS.

30:54.523 --> 30:56.485
Well, then I'll put it
to you this way.

30:56.485 --> 30:59.628
IF CONRAD DOESN'T
COME FORWARD...

30:59.628 --> 31:01.330
I WILL.

31:01.330 --> 31:04.033
I was enraged at
the injustice I felt

31:04.033 --> 31:06.395
when you framed me...

31:06.395 --> 31:11.170
for taking away everything
that I thought I deserved.

31:11.170 --> 31:15.905
I realized that those feelings
must pale in comparison

31:15.905 --> 31:17.977
to what David Clarke
must have felt.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.478
To have his life
ripped away from him,

31:19.478 --> 31:22.081
his career...

31:22.081 --> 31:24.613
his little girl.

31:24.613 --> 31:27.886
And to think that
I helped do that to him.

31:27.886 --> 31:32.161
I played God.

31:32.161 --> 31:33.963
YOU PROMISED ME
YOUR FORGIVENESS.

31:33.963 --> 31:37.126
I DO.

31:37.126 --> 31:39.428
I FORGIVE YOU.

31:39.428 --> 31:41.630
But you're not God, either.

31:41.630 --> 31:44.503
I urge you to let go
of whatever grudge you may have

31:44.503 --> 31:50.039

DANIEL, ON THE OTHER HAND...

40:06.905 --> 40:09.077
HE INSTALLED A SECURITY SYSTEM
IN MY HOUSE.

40:09.077 --> 40:11.610
I'M SORRY IF THAT MADE THINGS
WORSE FOR YOU.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.911
THAT WASN'T MY INTENT.

40:14.142 --> 40:15.844
BUT IT WORKED.

40:17.886 --> 40:20.148
THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.

40:21.790 --> 40:24.553
WELL, I KNEW THAT
IF YOU REACHED OUT TO ME,

40:24.553 --> 40:27.125
I MUST BE THE ONLY ONE
YOU COULD TURN TO.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.832
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT DANIEL SHOT YOU?

40:33.832 --> 40:36.064
OH, WHAT,
HE JUST ADMITTED THAT NOW?

40:36.064 --> 40:38.467
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
QUAKING IN HIS BOOTS

40:38.467 --> 40:40.168
TO SEE ME AGAIN,
THAT LITTLE COWARD.

40:40.168 --> 40:43.211
WHERE WAS IT?

40:45.874 --> 40:49.518
(buttons popping)

41:04.032 --> 41:05.193
EMILY.

41:05.193 --> 41:06.765
I'M SORRY.

41:06.765 --> 41:11.239
YOU REALLY THINK THAT
GRAYSON'S GONNA TURN HIMSELF IN?

41:11.239 --> 41:14.743
FOR ONCE, I HAVE FAITH.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.508
BYE.

41:20.709 --> 41:23.081
(Emily)
 A GUILTY HEART IS SILENT--

41:23.081 --> 41:27.055
ITS PULSE MUFFLED BY
 THE SECRETS IT KEEPS.

41:27.055 --> 41:30.188
WHILE SOME BELIEVE CONFESSION
 CAN RELEASE A TORTURED SOUL,

41:30.188 --> 41:32.991
OTHERS VIEW IT AS
 A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.
