00:14.663 --> 00:17.830
<i>Okay, let's bring it up a bit.</i>

00:20.858 --> 00:23.614
I love it.

00:26.786 --> 00:30.355
My dad is gonna hit the
roof when he gets the bill.

00:30.380 --> 00:32.546
What's he gonna do, fire you?

00:32.549 --> 00:34.516
I wish he would.

00:34.518 --> 00:36.217
You liar.

00:36.219 --> 00:38.420
All right, it needs to go 6 inches lower.

00:38.422 --> 00:40.655
The street level sight line.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.905
Look out!

00:46.673 --> 00:49.941
Russel!

00:49.966 --> 00:50.965
You're okay.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.033
Oh my God, you're okay.

00:52.035 --> 00:53.940
No, don't. Don't touch him.

00:53.965 --> 00:55.064
Go call 911.

00:55.066 --> 00:57.470
You're okay, you're okay.

00:57.495 --> 00:58.536
No, no, no, look at me.

00:58.577 --> 00:59.340
Look at me, honey.

00:59.365 --> 01:01.364
Could someone please help over here?

01:03.258 --> 01:04.757
- Trauma 4.
- Incoming.

01:04.783 --> 01:05.882
45-year-old male,

01:05.884 --> 01:08.084
multiple penetrating injuries to the chest.

01:08.086 --> 01:10.086
GCS 12, BP's 90 over palp.

01:10.088 --> 01:11.521
Did you give him anything for pain?

01:11.523 --> 01:13.512
We've given him 4 morphine and 500 saline.

01:13.537 --> 01:14.786
What happened?

01:14.811 --> 01:17.246
Chandelier fell from about 20
feet and landed right on him.

01:17.271 --> 01:18.737
How long ago was this?

01:18.762 --> 01:19.828
Maybe 30 minutes.

01:19.853 --> 01:21.640
- Did he lose consciousness?
- No.

01:21.665 --> 01:22.698
All right.

01:22.723 --> 01:24.052
Let's get ready to move 'em.

01:24.076 --> 01:25.375
Very gently on my count.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.306
One, two, three.

01:27.331 --> 01:28.833
Ah!

01:28.858 --> 01:32.293
All right, can you tell me your name?

01:32.318 --> 01:34.156
Russel Rollins.

01:34.181 --> 01:35.748
Russel?

01:35.773 --> 01:37.486
Connor, oh, thank God.

01:37.511 --> 01:38.610
Help me.

01:38.635 --> 01:39.682
All right, we're going to, bud.

01:39.707 --> 01:40.822
All right, airway's in tact.

01:40.847 --> 01:41.982
Get me a set of vitals.

01:42.007 --> 01:43.474
Someone draw a gas and get a chest X ray.

01:43.499 --> 01:45.243
- You know him?
- Since I was a kid.

01:45.268 --> 01:46.857
Russel, can you move your fingers and toes?

01:46.882 --> 01:48.067
I think.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.567
- Where did this happen?
- At the store.

01:50.592 --> 01:53.123
Claire?

01:53.626 --> 01:55.538
Sat's 90. Heart rate's 124.

01:55.563 --> 01:57.029
All right, everybody, quiet.

01:57.054 --> 01:59.521
Russel, take a deep breath for me, huh?

02:02.572 --> 02:04.019
I don't hear much on the left side.

02:04.044 --> 02:05.844
We're gonna need a chest X ray.

02:05.869 --> 02:07.969
It's not optimal, but we're
gonna do it from here.

02:07.994 --> 02:09.354
Am I going to die?

02:09.378 --> 02:11.446
Hey, Russel, listen to me. No, you are not.

02:11.471 --> 02:12.971
No, you are gonna be fine, Russel.

02:12.996 --> 02:15.076
- You're gonna be fine.
- You have to wait over here.

02:16.097 --> 02:18.465
All right, I'm gonna
hold the plate from here.

02:18.490 --> 02:21.733
You just shoot as head
on as possible, okay?

02:22.083 --> 02:23.565
- You got it?
- Here, Russ.

02:23.590 --> 02:26.098
Listen to me. You're doing great, buddy.

02:26.123 --> 02:28.671
I just need you to keep as
still as possible, please.

02:28.696 --> 02:30.687
X-ray. Everyone clear?

02:30.712 --> 02:31.752
Both: Clear.

02:36.394 --> 02:38.452
Big hemopneumothorax with some shift.

02:38.477 --> 02:39.253
He needs a chest tube.

02:39.278 --> 02:40.310
I got it.

02:42.713 --> 02:44.475
Who's the trauma attending on call?

02:44.500 --> 02:45.337
Dr. Zanetti.

02:45.362 --> 02:47.104
Page her. Tell her we need
her down here right now.

02:47.129 --> 02:48.473
Got it.

02:48.498 --> 02:50.162
I'm sorry, are you family?

02:50.187 --> 02:51.453
I'm... I'm his employer.

02:51.478 --> 02:52.956
Claire Rhodes from Dolan Rhodes.

02:52.981 --> 02:55.081
- The department store?
- Yeah.

02:55.106 --> 02:58.775
- Dr. Rhodes, is he...
- He's my brother.

03:01.606 --> 03:06.836
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:14.411 --> 03:15.185
What are we looking at?

03:15.210 --> 03:16.663
45-year-old male.

03:16.688 --> 03:18.352
Impaled glass in his left chest.

03:18.377 --> 03:21.017
Arrived hypotensive, but
responded to blood and fluids.

03:21.042 --> 03:22.441
Left tension pneumo.

03:22.466 --> 03:23.624
That's a cluster.

03:23.649 --> 03:24.977
Oh, God.

03:27.329 --> 03:29.482
Ma'am, let me show you where you can wait.

03:29.507 --> 03:31.741
Got a chest tube in on the left side.

03:31.766 --> 03:32.931
Pressure's improved.

03:32.956 --> 03:34.423
Base deficit was 8.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.481
We need to get this thing off
to see what we're dealing with.

03:36.506 --> 03:37.672
What did you sedate him with?

03:37.697 --> 03:39.563
Got two of versed with the chest tube.

03:39.588 --> 03:40.787
Which one of you is in charge?

03:40.812 --> 03:41.711
That's me.

03:41.736 --> 03:44.293
I need to remove it
without allowing this piece

03:44.318 --> 03:46.531
to vibrate in the
slightest, so I'm thinking

03:46.556 --> 03:50.985
cuts here, here, and here.

03:51.010 --> 03:52.176
Yes, ma'am.

03:56.493 --> 03:58.227
Nat.

03:58.252 --> 03:59.591
Guess who Connor is.

03:59.616 --> 04:01.249
I'm not talking to you.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.003
Oh, come on.

04:03.028 --> 04:04.328
What was it you said?

04:04.353 --> 04:07.304
"Try thinking like a doctor,
not a pregnant woman?"

04:07.329 --> 04:09.729
I was crazed, all right?

04:09.754 --> 04:11.221
I didn't mean it.

04:11.246 --> 04:13.297
You meant it.

04:13.952 --> 04:16.952
Look, I need to ask you about a patient.

04:17.456 --> 04:21.091
You wrote that article
review on vertigo, right?

04:21.117 --> 04:24.485
Yes, that and other pediatric
vestibular disorders, why?

04:24.510 --> 04:27.336
Well, I got a 24-year-old
in four who lost her balance

04:27.361 --> 04:28.360
and took a header.

04:28.362 --> 04:30.320
I'd like a second opinion.

04:38.961 --> 04:41.629
- Get that package yet?
- What package?

04:41.654 --> 04:43.454
I sent you an olive branch.

04:43.479 --> 04:45.446
Not a real olive branch obviously,

04:45.471 --> 04:47.356
although now that I'm thinking about that,

04:47.381 --> 04:50.729
maybe that was the way to go.

04:50.867 --> 04:53.401
I'm trying to apologize.

04:53.426 --> 04:55.960
What's the patient's name?

04:55.985 --> 04:58.603
Dylan. Her name is Dylan.

05:06.177 --> 05:09.179
Captain Trevor Jackson. Ma'am.

05:09.237 --> 05:11.773
- Army?
- Ranger. First Battalion.

05:11.798 --> 05:13.430
- 75th Regiment.
- Cool.

05:13.455 --> 05:15.553
- Follow my pen line.
- You served?

05:15.578 --> 05:17.279
Navy. Reservist now.

05:17.304 --> 05:19.538
You're a long way from Georgia.
What brings you in today?

05:19.563 --> 05:21.591
Fender bender. It was my fault.

05:21.616 --> 05:23.949
I got light-headed. Thought
I was gonna pass out.

05:23.951 --> 05:25.287
Well, you been drinking, soldier?

05:25.312 --> 05:27.192
No, sir.

05:27.217 --> 05:29.651
Blood work.

05:29.676 --> 05:31.503
You two in town for business, pleasure?

05:31.528 --> 05:33.428
Visiting my family. Lincoln Park.

05:33.453 --> 05:34.919
I got to get back to duty.

05:34.944 --> 05:37.926
Mother-in-law's cooking
packing on the pounds.

05:37.951 --> 05:39.484
- Kids?
- Not yet.

05:39.509 --> 05:41.317
One day, baby, one day.

05:41.477 --> 05:43.143
I don't want her to
have to raise kids alone

05:43.168 --> 05:44.514
while I'm still being deployed.

05:44.539 --> 05:46.310
Captain Jackson, are you diabetic?

05:46.335 --> 05:47.668
No.

05:47.693 --> 05:49.585
I'm afraid these numbers
indicate differently.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.744
- Your blood sugar's at 350.
- What? No.

05:51.746 --> 05:52.993
There's no way I have diabetes.

05:53.018 --> 05:54.931
Baby, listen to the doctor.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.504
If I have diabetes,

05:56.529 --> 05:59.305
they won't deploy me, and that's it.

05:59.330 --> 06:03.182
I'm done, and I can't be a soldier anymore.

06:03.207 --> 06:05.718
You understand.

06:06.687 --> 06:09.538
Well, it's true you don't have
the classic risk factors...

06:09.563 --> 06:11.830
Obesity, family history...

06:11.855 --> 06:13.464
And your white blood count is elevated,

06:13.489 --> 06:15.289
so it's possible there's
some underlying infection

06:15.314 --> 06:16.840
driving your blood glucose up.

06:16.865 --> 06:17.591
Okay.

06:17.616 --> 06:19.457
We'll run some more tests,
see if that's the case.

06:19.482 --> 06:21.049
Please.

06:21.195 --> 06:24.295
All right, we'll be right back.

06:24.320 --> 06:27.585
It's gonna be okay, honey.

06:35.210 --> 06:38.279
Can you smile for me, Dylan?

06:38.726 --> 06:40.426
All right, now I'd like
you to tilt your head

06:40.428 --> 06:42.600
to your left for me, all right?

06:42.625 --> 06:45.659
I tried an Epley already.
It didn't seem to help.

06:49.930 --> 06:52.397
- Can you hear this?
- Yes.

06:52.422 --> 06:54.449
How about now?

06:55.886 --> 06:58.621
Not as well as the other.

06:58.854 --> 07:01.024
- You a musician?
- Mm-hmm.

07:01.049 --> 07:02.808
Getting my master's at CCPA.

07:02.833 --> 07:05.500
The Conservatory? Impressive.

07:05.525 --> 07:08.217
Follow my finger for me, all right?

07:08.577 --> 07:10.299
I don't mean to scare you,

07:10.324 --> 07:12.920
but becoming a doctor was
actually my fallback plan.

07:12.944 --> 07:16.813
I wanted to be a musician;
a violinist, in fact.

07:16.838 --> 07:19.038
I don't have a fallback plan.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.977
Music's all I ever wanted to do.

07:21.002 --> 07:22.968
You see, that's what I was missing.

07:22.970 --> 07:24.463
Here, can you squeeze my hands?

07:24.488 --> 07:27.622
Plus, Paganini's C minor
Caprice broke my will.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.947
You and just about everyone else.

07:29.972 --> 07:31.472
- It's a bear.
- Yeah.

07:33.383 --> 07:36.262
I played snare in marching
band freshman year.

07:39.286 --> 07:41.387
What do you call the guy
who hangs out with the band

07:41.389 --> 07:43.486
but isn't a musician?

07:43.768 --> 07:44.968
The drummer.

07:44.993 --> 07:47.026
Thanks.

07:47.051 --> 07:48.751
I've got my recital next month,

07:48.776 --> 07:50.542
all Bach program.

07:50.567 --> 07:53.695
- Maybe you can come.
- Sure, I'd love to.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.220
Dr. Halstead.

07:58.282 --> 08:00.016
She's got a slight nystagmus in her...

08:00.041 --> 08:01.107
In her right eye, I know.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.036
And the hearing loss in the left.

08:03.061 --> 08:04.905
I'm thinking it could be syndromic.

08:04.930 --> 08:06.931
Well, apparently you didn't need a consult.

08:06.956 --> 08:10.057
Come on, I value your opinion.

08:12.830 --> 08:15.465
How come you never told me
you wanted to be a musician?

08:15.490 --> 08:16.822
You want an opinion?

08:16.847 --> 08:20.585
Call a neurosurgeon and
send her for a stat head CT.

08:25.718 --> 08:28.387
I want a CTA of his chest ASAP.

08:28.412 --> 08:29.878
Figure out exactly what's bleeding.

08:29.903 --> 08:32.352
Got to get him on his back
before we get him upstairs.

08:32.376 --> 08:33.897
- Oh, you're gonna use...
- Yes, he is.

08:33.922 --> 08:35.489
Can you hold the patient
steady please? Thank you.

08:35.514 --> 08:36.885
All right, hang in there, Russ.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.751
All right, we're gonna
flip him over onto his back

08:45.753 --> 08:47.019
gently on my count.

08:47.021 --> 08:49.722
One, two, three.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.749
Okay.

08:53.465 --> 08:55.084
All right, let's start to package him up.

08:55.109 --> 08:57.176
Newbie, start a femoral line.

09:05.936 --> 09:08.085
I got this.

09:10.810 --> 09:12.889
Reese, get over here and help me

09:12.914 --> 09:16.023
splint the glass to keep it still.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.194
One wrong move on the way,

09:18.219 --> 09:20.776
and he could have a massive hemorrhage.

09:20.801 --> 09:22.469
- Maggie?
- Yep.

09:22.494 --> 09:23.660
Call the blood bank.

09:23.685 --> 09:26.085
Tell them I want five
more blood, five plasma,

09:26.110 --> 09:28.198
and six platelets typed and crossed.

09:28.223 --> 09:29.455
Yes, ma'am.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.871
All right, are we ready?

09:38.528 --> 09:40.875
Look, I wish I had more to tell you.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.040
Russel's on his way to CAT scan right now,

09:43.065 --> 09:44.498
so we can figure out what's injured.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.200
We think that it has something to do

09:46.201 --> 09:47.633
with the subclavian artery.

09:47.635 --> 09:48.971
English?

09:48.996 --> 09:51.773
The one that supplies blood to the arm.

09:51.797 --> 09:53.997
He's gonna need an operation.

09:54.342 --> 09:55.641
We have to remove the glass and...

09:55.643 --> 09:57.944
You haven't removed the glass?

09:57.946 --> 10:01.002
It's actually keeping him
from bleeding to death.

10:01.027 --> 10:04.060
We are trying to get good
imaging so that when we operate,

10:04.085 --> 10:05.251
we're not going in blind.

10:05.253 --> 10:06.853
So get it.

10:10.363 --> 10:14.366
Is this how it's gonna be?

10:14.391 --> 10:17.264
What did you expect?

10:17.289 --> 10:19.872
I had to leave, okay?

10:19.897 --> 10:21.467
The way things were with
Dad, there was no...

10:21.492 --> 10:24.193
Right, you left him, Connor,

10:24.218 --> 10:26.639
but you left me too.

10:31.099 --> 10:33.834
Just go take care of Russel.

10:51.040 --> 10:55.376
Did you hear? He's <i> that</i> Rhodes.

10:55.401 --> 10:59.417
Oh, a prince in disguise.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.834
Your friend with the glass shards?

11:07.859 --> 11:09.925
Uh-huh.

11:09.950 --> 11:14.219
These are them. Unusual case.

11:14.255 --> 11:15.323
Couldn't help myself.

11:15.348 --> 11:17.781
Yeah, I get it.

11:17.806 --> 11:20.440
Looks like this thing goes
through the left subclavian.

11:20.465 --> 11:23.304
There's just so much scatter
with the leaded glass.

11:23.329 --> 11:25.565
It's impossible to make out the details.

11:25.567 --> 11:27.568
I think we're gonna have
to go to interventional

11:27.593 --> 11:29.802
for an angiogram.

11:29.804 --> 11:31.873
Want my opinion?

11:31.898 --> 11:33.798
Yeah, sure.

11:33.823 --> 11:36.265
Try Surgical Theater's SNAP.

11:36.409 --> 11:38.309
What's that?

11:38.517 --> 11:39.983
S-N-A-P?

11:40.008 --> 11:43.882
Surgical Navigation Advanced Platform?

11:45.030 --> 11:46.730
You ought to crack a
journal once in a while.

11:46.755 --> 11:48.087
Yeah, well...

11:48.089 --> 11:50.957
SNAP three-dimensionalizes CT images.

11:50.959 --> 11:52.191
Because it's 3-D,

11:52.193 --> 11:55.394
you see your surgical
point from every angle.

11:55.396 --> 11:58.931
Okay, well, where do I find this SNAP?

11:58.933 --> 12:03.002
There is one in the main OR neuro room.

12:03.004 --> 12:05.004
Great, thank you.

12:05.006 --> 12:07.807
Dolan Rhodes.

12:07.809 --> 12:09.509
I bought some socks there once,

12:09.511 --> 12:12.577
the only thing I could afford.

12:12.602 --> 12:16.804
If this works out, I'll get you a tie.

12:17.252 --> 12:20.052
<i>Dr. Travis, you have a
visitor in the main lobby.</i>

12:20.054 --> 12:22.000
Captain Jackson, Mrs. Jackson,

12:22.025 --> 12:24.152
I'm Dr. Manning, Natalie Manning.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.625
Ma'am?

12:25.627 --> 12:27.118
I understand you're a Ranger.

12:27.120 --> 12:30.173
- First Battalion?
- Yes, ma'am.

12:30.198 --> 12:32.064
My husband was in the First Battalion.

12:32.066 --> 12:34.267
Captain Jeffrey Manning.

12:34.269 --> 12:35.935
Was?

12:35.937 --> 12:38.538
He was killed in action

12:38.540 --> 12:41.140
six months ago,

12:41.142 --> 12:43.543
Kandahar Province.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.352
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

12:46.377 --> 12:48.494
I didn't know your husband.

12:51.073 --> 12:53.119
Jeff always got so uncomfortable

12:53.121 --> 12:55.221
when people would say,
"Thank you for your service."

12:55.223 --> 12:58.724
But I guess that's what I want to say.

12:58.726 --> 13:00.784
Appreciate it.

13:00.809 --> 13:04.444
And thank you for your sacrifice.

13:09.071 --> 13:11.316
Nat?

13:16.906 --> 13:20.075
I thought I would pay my respects,

13:20.100 --> 13:23.101
but it was really about Jeff...

13:23.126 --> 13:26.047
me looking for Jeff.

13:40.868 --> 13:44.203
- Dad.
- Doctor.

13:44.205 --> 13:47.073
How's our patient doing?

13:47.075 --> 13:49.686
Russel's stabilized for now.

13:49.712 --> 13:50.994
I have found something

13:51.019 --> 13:52.805
that could help us with the surgery.

13:52.830 --> 13:55.600
It's an imaging system
called Surgical Theatre SNAP.

13:55.625 --> 13:56.292
Okay.

13:56.317 --> 13:58.823
It's FDA approved, so
insurance is gonna cover it,

13:58.848 --> 14:02.013
but Russel is going to
be looking at a lengthy

14:02.038 --> 14:03.797
hospital stay afterwards,

14:03.822 --> 14:05.487
and I just want to make sure that...

14:05.512 --> 14:08.403
That somebody covers the co-pay?

14:08.428 --> 14:11.505
- We will.
- Hang on there, Bernie Sanders.

14:11.530 --> 14:14.498
Now, I love Russel as much as you do,

14:14.523 --> 14:16.823
but we have to be
responsible to the company.

14:16.848 --> 14:19.299
Are you prepared to do this
for every one of our employees?

14:19.324 --> 14:23.244
We are talking about Russel here.

14:23.269 --> 14:26.162
God, he's worked for us
since he was 14 years old.

14:26.187 --> 14:29.372
- He's family.
- Us?

14:29.397 --> 14:32.282
When did it become "us"?

14:40.885 --> 14:43.415
- That's your dad?
- Yep.

14:43.440 --> 14:46.296
Fathers like that keep
me in business, baby.

14:48.368 --> 14:50.870
Dr. Charles, do you have a minute?

14:50.895 --> 14:52.661
Sit down.

14:52.686 --> 14:55.053
Don't mind if I eat. I missed breakfast.

14:55.078 --> 14:56.745
Please.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.936
It's my patient, Captain Jackson.

14:58.961 --> 15:01.862
He's a physically fit
active service army ranger,

15:01.887 --> 15:05.089
but his blood sugars
indicate he has diabetes.

15:05.114 --> 15:07.220
You run labs? Do a CT?

15:07.245 --> 15:09.212
His pancreas is healthy.

15:09.237 --> 15:10.570
There are no signs of tumors.

15:10.595 --> 15:11.694
His labs came back clear

15:11.719 --> 15:13.931
for infection and autoimmune disease.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.556
I can't find a reason for his diabetes,

15:15.581 --> 15:18.340
but I did find this.

15:18.365 --> 15:21.500
He fractured two thoracic vertebrae.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.643
- Ouch.
- Exactly.

15:23.668 --> 15:25.511
So why hasn't he said anything?

15:25.536 --> 15:27.803
Why do you think he hasn't said anything?

15:28.088 --> 15:30.122
Overseas, I saw a number of soldiers

15:30.147 --> 15:31.346
who were away from home a lot.

15:31.371 --> 15:32.603
They were depressed.

15:32.628 --> 15:34.990
Depressed patients tend
to mask or hide pain.

15:35.015 --> 15:36.081
Right.

15:36.083 --> 15:39.115
The thing is, diabetes is a red flag

15:39.140 --> 15:40.439
for the military.

15:40.464 --> 15:42.831
You test positive, you
don't go back to combat.

15:42.856 --> 15:45.339
So if you were depressed
about overseas deployment...

15:45.364 --> 15:47.431
You'd think he'd be happy to have diabetes.

15:47.456 --> 15:48.881
He's home for good.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.372
Well, that's not the case.

15:50.397 --> 15:52.330
Jackson's extremely
upset at the possibility

15:52.355 --> 15:55.256
of not going back to active service.

15:55.281 --> 15:58.155
Something's going on with him.

15:58.180 --> 16:00.585
Let's go say hello to Captain Jackson.

16:00.610 --> 16:02.823
Thank you, sir.

16:04.093 --> 16:07.493
Captain, this is Dr. Charles.

16:07.518 --> 16:09.117
He's a senior attending physician here.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.649
I've asked him to consult,

16:10.674 --> 16:12.774
just to make sure we're
covering all our bases.

16:12.799 --> 16:15.624
- Yes, sir.
- Please, as you were.

16:15.649 --> 16:16.848
- You're Mrs. Jackson?
- Yes.

16:16.873 --> 16:18.045
It's nice to meet you.

16:18.070 --> 16:21.090
I just wanted to make sure that
I have your history straight.

16:21.115 --> 16:23.315
So you've seen combat before?

16:23.340 --> 16:25.740
- Yes, sir.
- And this was your first tour?

16:25.765 --> 16:27.180
Seventh.

16:27.205 --> 16:29.605
Seventh. And...

16:29.630 --> 16:30.830
What was in the test results?

16:30.855 --> 16:32.688
You have a couple fractured vertebrae

16:32.713 --> 16:34.179
that will heal on their own,

16:34.204 --> 16:37.005
but all your other tests
failed to give us an answer.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.297
We can't find a clinical
reason for your high sugars.

16:39.322 --> 16:40.617
Clinical? What does that mean?

16:40.642 --> 16:43.228
A physical cause.

16:43.657 --> 16:45.747
I'm sorry, what kind of doctor are you?

16:45.772 --> 16:47.644
He's a psychiatrist.

16:47.669 --> 16:49.435
A shrink?

16:49.460 --> 16:51.581
I don't need a shrink; I'm not crazy.

16:51.606 --> 16:52.502
Nobody's saying that you are.

16:52.527 --> 16:53.860
Honey, they're just trying to help you.

16:53.884 --> 16:55.317
How is a shrink gonna help me?

16:55.342 --> 16:57.971
As I said, we're covering all our bases.

16:57.996 --> 16:59.466
- You think I'm faking this?
- No.

16:59.491 --> 17:00.690
You can't fake blood sugar.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.415
So what are you saying, huh?

17:02.440 --> 17:03.973
You think I did something to myself?

17:03.998 --> 17:05.204
You think I'm a coward?

17:05.230 --> 17:07.063
Not for a second is
anybody saying you're...

17:07.088 --> 17:08.521
- Trevor.
- Whoa, whoa, Mr. Jackson.

17:08.546 --> 17:10.087
- Captain.
- I'm out of here.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.679
- Mr. Jackson...
- Whoa, whoa, Captain.

17:11.704 --> 17:14.138
Whoa, whoa.

17:15.582 --> 17:18.683
- Jackson!
- Captain! Captain!

17:18.708 --> 17:22.872
- Nurse, please, a little help!
- Come on, baby.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.636
Watch your back. Left.

17:26.661 --> 17:30.084
Straight to surgery. Thank you.

17:30.109 --> 17:32.590
Hey, Maggie? Can you help me out?

17:32.615 --> 17:34.014
With what?

17:34.039 --> 17:37.191
With, you know, an IV.

17:37.216 --> 17:39.602
The patient's veins are really small.

17:39.627 --> 17:41.239
How many goes have you had?

17:41.264 --> 17:42.241
Three.

17:42.265 --> 17:44.265
Oh, man.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.623
Okay, I got a kid with a broken arm in two.

17:46.648 --> 17:47.969
No needles.

17:47.994 --> 17:50.777
- Think you can manage that?
- Yes, ma'am.

17:54.339 --> 17:56.173
I'm not sure you're aware,

17:56.198 --> 17:59.564
but Connor knows Russel Rollins,

17:59.588 --> 18:01.849
and it just didn't seem appropriate to me

18:01.874 --> 18:04.008
that my son be the one treating him.

18:04.010 --> 18:05.747
Well, the degree of familiarity

18:05.772 --> 18:08.806
doesn't warrant taking
Dr. Rhodes off the case,

18:08.831 --> 18:11.765
and Mr. Rollins, when he was lucid,

18:11.784 --> 18:14.948
did not request another physician.

18:15.589 --> 18:17.189
Let me put it another way.

18:17.214 --> 18:21.519
I would like Russel to receive
the very best medical care,

18:21.544 --> 18:24.205
and I do not think my son can provide that.

18:24.230 --> 18:27.998
Your son is a first-rate surgeon,

18:28.000 --> 18:31.217
otherwise I would not have hired him.

18:31.242 --> 18:32.813
I want him off the case.

18:32.838 --> 18:34.538
It's not your decision to make, sir.

18:34.540 --> 18:37.641
Excuse me, but I'm the
one writing checks here.

18:37.643 --> 18:42.246
And while we appreciate
that, this is my shop,

18:42.248 --> 18:46.250
and I will not be pulling
Dr. Rhodes from the case.

18:49.995 --> 18:54.398
I want you to remember this conversation,

18:54.423 --> 18:56.872
because if anything happens to Russel,

18:56.897 --> 19:01.437
you will be repeating it in a courtroom.

19:01.462 --> 19:04.330
I will remember.

19:04.450 --> 19:07.760
And you, sir, have a nice day.

19:10.723 --> 19:13.208
This may not be your shop for long.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.135
- Dr. Halstead.
- Yeah?

19:20.160 --> 19:23.401
Your violinist. Radiology
just sent the report.

19:23.955 --> 19:26.106
Has anyone from
neurosurgery seen these yet?

19:26.131 --> 19:27.898
They're talking about scheduling surgery

19:27.900 --> 19:29.833
as soon as possible.

19:30.679 --> 19:33.614
Acoustic neuroma?

19:33.639 --> 19:36.039
Tumors, essentially,

19:36.064 --> 19:40.361
caused by a genetic condition
called neurofibromatosis.

19:40.386 --> 19:43.754
It disturbs nervous system cell growth.

19:43.779 --> 19:47.510
So these neuromas are pressing
against your inner ear,

19:47.535 --> 19:49.997
and that's why you've been
experiencing the hearing loss

19:50.022 --> 19:51.766
and the dizziness.

19:51.791 --> 19:55.153
We need to remove them and
stop the internal bleeding.

19:57.263 --> 20:00.394
- When?
- As soon as possible.

20:02.142 --> 20:05.411
What are the side effects?

20:05.436 --> 20:08.092
There's a good chance
you'll lose your hearing.

20:08.117 --> 20:10.584
My hearing?

20:10.609 --> 20:12.042
Yes.

20:20.332 --> 20:22.133
Dylan, I know it seems like

20:22.158 --> 20:24.688
your world is coming apart right now,

20:24.690 --> 20:27.559
but we got lucky here today.

20:27.584 --> 20:31.452
Okay, that fall you took
might've just saved your life.

20:31.477 --> 20:34.145
I'm a musician.

20:34.265 --> 20:35.771
This could've killed you,

20:35.796 --> 20:37.896
and you don't always get a warning sign.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.883
I want to transfer you upstairs

20:42.908 --> 20:45.008
and admit you into the hospital proper.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.671
Is that okay with you?

20:46.696 --> 20:48.923
No, I want to talk to the woman

20:48.948 --> 20:52.978
who was in here earlier... The violinist.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.203
Dr. Manning?

20:55.228 --> 20:59.664
I'm not going anywhere until I talk to her.

20:59.689 --> 21:03.172
Okay, I'll tell her.

21:16.701 --> 21:19.870
- How's he doing?
- Okay.

21:19.967 --> 21:21.400
Don't think it'd be a very good idea

21:21.425 --> 21:22.957
for me to go back in there.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.744
No.

21:26.940 --> 21:29.475
Wow, seven tours. That must be tough.

21:29.500 --> 21:32.425
Well, I knew what I was signing up for.

21:32.450 --> 21:35.218
- I'm proud of my husband.
- Of course.

21:35.345 --> 21:38.212
I just... I know you must
miss him and worry about him.

21:38.237 --> 21:40.593
Like every soldier's wife.

21:46.334 --> 21:48.015
And I know the illness is a blow,

21:48.040 --> 21:50.791
but at least, you know, you have him home,

21:50.816 --> 21:53.029
and he's close, right?

22:07.738 --> 22:09.839
Thank you.

22:09.864 --> 22:12.799
The chairman is here to see you...

22:12.824 --> 22:14.990
Of the hospital.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.111
- That's never good.
- Mm-hmm.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.965
He's waiting in your office.

22:20.893 --> 22:23.028
Okay.

22:27.285 --> 22:29.820
- Barry.
- Sharon.

22:29.845 --> 22:30.844
Nice surprise.

22:30.869 --> 22:32.068
Well, I was on my way

22:32.093 --> 22:33.593
to the Art Institute for a preview.

22:33.618 --> 22:36.986
- I thought I'd drop by.
- A little out of your way.

22:37.011 --> 22:41.347
I got a call from Cornelius Rhodes.

22:41.394 --> 22:44.495
He's friends with some members
of the board... golf buddies.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.728
- Said he spoke with you today.
- He did.

22:46.999 --> 22:50.467
Unfortunately, he feels his
concerns were not addressed.

22:50.492 --> 22:54.260
Oh, no, they were addressed.

22:54.350 --> 22:56.717
He feels he was dismissed.

22:56.742 --> 23:00.244
Good. I'm glad he got the message.

23:00.246 --> 23:03.947
Sharon, I would never tell
you how to run this hospital.

23:03.949 --> 23:06.183
And I appreciate your faith in me, Barry.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.719
But the Rhodes are wealthy people.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.888
Mm-hmm, and how much has Mr. Rhodes

23:10.890 --> 23:12.356
given to this hospital?

23:12.358 --> 23:14.155
His mother's donated quite a bit.

23:14.180 --> 23:17.733
No, no, how much has <i> he</i> donated?

23:17.863 --> 23:21.509
Mr. Rhodes was talking about
making a $200,000 gift.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.400
Right. Talking.

23:23.402 --> 23:26.002
I don't think we can ignore
the fact that the Rhodes...

23:26.027 --> 23:28.027
Barry, listen.

23:28.040 --> 23:31.241
I can understand the
need to cultivate donors.

23:31.243 --> 23:36.054
Mr. Rhodes can make a $200 million gift,

23:36.079 --> 23:39.113
but I still will not let him dictate

23:39.138 --> 23:41.998
who performs surgery in this hospital,

23:42.023 --> 23:46.125
and I think going to war
for that conniving S.O.B.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.792
is not a good idea.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.013
Incredible.

24:07.038 --> 24:09.839
Wait till you get the headset on.

24:09.864 --> 24:12.093
It's like I'm moving
around inside of his body.

24:12.118 --> 24:15.180
Okay, so tell me how this thing works.

24:15.205 --> 24:17.475
It combines images from the CT angiogram

24:17.500 --> 24:20.434
and creates a three-dimensional
model of the patient's anatomy.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.867
With the HTC Vibe, you get virtual reality.

24:22.892 --> 24:26.443
It allows us to better
tailor our operation.

24:26.468 --> 24:27.975
Are you having some concerns?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.167
No, no, no, just... just curious.

24:30.169 --> 24:33.697
Oh, by the way, Dr. Rhodes,
I met your father today.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.383
Yeah? Did he charm you?

24:35.408 --> 24:37.180
Not exactly.

24:37.205 --> 24:39.873
Hey, Dr. Zanetti.

24:39.898 --> 24:44.165
Take a look at the
middle-left subclavian artery.

24:44.190 --> 24:46.561
The glass is going straight through.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.095
It's like a finger in a dike.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.387
I can't believe there's
still flow past the injury.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.773
Rotate a little to the left.

24:53.345 --> 24:54.568
There.

24:54.593 --> 24:56.093
Looks like our dike sprung a leak.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.388
- He's bleeding.
- Yeah.

24:58.413 --> 25:01.099
I think we can get away
with a collarbone incision.

25:01.124 --> 25:03.535
Come on, let's go.

25:09.816 --> 25:14.021
Claire, Dad, this is Dr. Zanetti.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.146
Russel is being prepped
for surgery right now,

25:16.148 --> 25:18.382
and she and I will perform the operation.

25:18.384 --> 25:20.284
Okay.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.928
You must have a lot of faith in him.

25:22.953 --> 25:24.632
I do.

25:24.657 --> 25:27.858
Hmm, I never thought I'd see the day;

25:27.883 --> 25:31.543
my son saving lives.

25:35.277 --> 25:38.947
Your father, is he as big
a tube steak as he seems?

25:38.972 --> 25:40.404
That he is.

25:40.439 --> 25:41.860
You leave him out there, Rhodes.

25:41.885 --> 25:43.918
Don't bring him in here.

25:57.081 --> 26:00.219
Okay.

26:00.787 --> 26:02.139
All right.

26:02.164 --> 26:04.542
- Ready to pull this out?
- Ready.

26:04.567 --> 26:05.857
Okay, take a deep breath,

26:05.882 --> 26:09.029
and whatever you do,
do not break the glass.

26:23.509 --> 26:24.976
Damn it.

26:25.001 --> 26:27.468
You lacerated the subclavian vein.

26:27.493 --> 26:28.998
I need suction.

26:34.707 --> 26:37.636
We have 20 seconds before he bleeds out.

26:40.248 --> 26:41.576
More suction.

26:41.601 --> 26:42.951
Systolic's 90.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.676
What's going on? Are you guys in trouble?

26:44.701 --> 26:46.633
Shut up, Marty, just give him blood.

26:46.658 --> 26:48.458
4-0 Proline.

26:48.538 --> 26:49.817
Suction there.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.176
- Right there.
- No, that's not it.

26:52.178 --> 26:53.644
Damn it, I can't see anything.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.786
He's 34 degrees.

26:55.811 --> 26:57.887
I can't see a thing. More suction.

26:57.912 --> 27:00.346
Dr. Zanetti, let me. I got this.

27:01.846 --> 27:04.019
Let me.

27:09.131 --> 27:11.355
You better not screw this up.

27:30.519 --> 27:32.849
Gentle.

27:36.604 --> 27:38.699
Okay, I got it.

27:38.724 --> 27:40.474
That wasn't about your father, was it?

27:40.499 --> 27:43.887
I really hope you weren't
trying to prove something.

27:53.070 --> 27:54.715
The Captain has been gaining weight,

27:54.740 --> 27:56.841
seems to bruise easily.

27:56.843 --> 27:59.339
That's totally consistent.

27:59.364 --> 28:01.594
I just can't believe it.

28:04.938 --> 28:07.206
Let me do this.

28:07.362 --> 28:09.230
Mrs. Jackson?

28:09.283 --> 28:10.949
I'm sorry, I don't want these to get cold.

28:10.974 --> 28:13.891
I... I won't keep you long.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.632
In reviewing your husband's symptoms,

28:15.657 --> 28:18.629
I'm pretty sure I know
what's causing his diabetes.

28:18.631 --> 28:19.592
Hmm.

28:19.617 --> 28:22.542
And, um... And I think you do too.

28:24.003 --> 28:27.338
What? What are you talking about?

28:27.585 --> 28:29.685
You don't lie a whole lot, don't you?

28:29.710 --> 28:31.794
I mean, you're certainly
not very good at it,

28:31.819 --> 28:33.310
to your great credit.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.896
To lie well, you have to loosen up.

28:35.921 --> 28:38.315
You know, make eye
contact, stuff like that.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.917
I don't understand what you're saying.

28:39.919 --> 28:43.054
I mean, lie? Lie about what?

28:44.166 --> 28:45.366
Somebody's got to go in there

28:45.391 --> 28:47.258
and tell your husband the truth.

28:47.260 --> 28:49.242
I could do it.

28:57.519 --> 28:59.479
Let me hold those for you.

29:08.814 --> 29:12.782
Maggie, any word from Dr.
Rhodes on the surgery?

29:12.807 --> 29:15.386
Nope, he's still in the OR.

29:15.388 --> 29:16.787
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

29:16.789 --> 29:20.458
Oh, please, I am having a terrible day.

29:20.460 --> 29:22.126
It's about to get a little bit worse.

29:22.128 --> 29:25.690
We have a case of domestic
abuse on our hands.

29:25.715 --> 29:27.681
You couldn't!

29:27.802 --> 29:29.344
Are you out of your mind?

29:29.369 --> 29:32.277
That woman has been poisoning
her husband with prednisone.

29:32.302 --> 29:35.384
Why would you do something like that?

29:35.409 --> 29:37.931
Oh, my God.

29:42.457 --> 29:46.461
I read on the Internet that
if I gave him some prednisone,

29:46.486 --> 29:50.144
it would look like diabetes.

29:50.169 --> 29:54.304
I just wanted him home safe.

29:54.637 --> 29:57.371
It's been ten years

29:57.396 --> 29:59.739
of worry,

29:59.764 --> 30:02.112
of nightmares.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.819
You can understand why I did it, can't you?

30:06.844 --> 30:10.093
Well, whether I understand
or not, it doesn't matter.

30:10.118 --> 30:11.575
There's a doctor here.

30:11.577 --> 30:16.367
Her husband was a ranger, and she lost him.

30:16.486 --> 30:18.153
He's dead.

30:18.304 --> 30:21.872
Isn't it better to be sick than dead?

30:21.897 --> 30:24.121
Why did you let it go so far?

30:24.123 --> 30:26.290
Why didn't you talk to someone?

30:26.292 --> 30:29.660
What good would talking do?

30:29.662 --> 30:32.703
I wanted him home.

30:32.728 --> 30:34.798
Talking wouldn't bring him home.

30:34.801 --> 30:37.368
Mrs. Jackson, I'm sorry.

30:37.393 --> 30:41.255
What you did is a crime,
and I have to report it.

30:42.034 --> 30:44.763
Am I going to go to jail?

30:45.562 --> 30:48.262
I don't know.

30:57.684 --> 30:59.334
She's not gonna do the surgery,

30:59.359 --> 31:01.793
at least not until she's given the recital.

31:01.818 --> 31:04.713
You told her those tumors
might kill her first?

31:04.738 --> 31:07.508
Hearing and being heard

31:07.533 --> 31:09.934
it's how Dylan interacts with the world.

31:09.936 --> 31:12.177
She can't imagine her
life without that ability.

31:12.202 --> 31:14.269
She needs more time to process all of this.

31:14.294 --> 31:15.593
She doesn't have more time.

31:15.608 --> 31:16.880
I don't know what to tell you.

31:16.905 --> 31:18.609
It's not our decision to make.

31:18.611 --> 31:19.476
I don't believe this.

31:19.501 --> 31:20.755
I miss something with one patient,

31:20.780 --> 31:21.946
and it's too late to fix it,

31:21.948 --> 31:23.820
then I catch something like this early on,

31:23.845 --> 31:25.983
and I still can't fix it.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.395
Nat, the medicine is clear.

31:27.420 --> 31:29.887
The patient should not be
making this decision. I should.

31:29.889 --> 31:32.256
So you became a doctor to
tell people what to do?

31:32.258 --> 31:35.371
I became a doctor to save people's lives.

31:35.396 --> 31:37.305
It's all I've ever wanted to do.

31:37.330 --> 31:39.907
I don't have a fallback
plan or some hidden passion.

31:39.932 --> 31:42.520
This is it for me.

31:42.545 --> 31:44.745
It's just...

31:44.770 --> 31:48.662
no one ever told me there'd
be this much loss involved.

32:05.264 --> 32:08.600
I pulled this out of the
deep depths of my closet.

32:08.602 --> 32:11.063
I reached out to
Anne-Sophie Mutter's people,

32:11.088 --> 32:14.054
but it seems she's on tour in China, so...

32:16.561 --> 32:18.762
I'm guessing you know
Bach's "Concerto in D minor"

32:18.764 --> 32:20.263
for two violins?

32:20.265 --> 32:23.539
- In my day, we all learned it.
- Sure.

32:25.169 --> 32:27.237
Get out your violin, Dylan.

32:27.262 --> 32:30.997
We're gonna have that recital. Come on.

32:35.307 --> 32:37.642
The tumor's that bad?

32:37.667 --> 32:42.109
Yes, but we're gonna get it out.

32:43.056 --> 32:45.423
And my hearing?

32:45.448 --> 32:49.717
Let me explain something.

32:49.742 --> 32:52.209
The memory is not just in the head.

32:52.234 --> 32:55.669
We also have what's
called kinesthetic memory,

32:55.694 --> 32:57.544
the body's memory.

32:57.569 --> 33:00.470
It remembers movement, resistance,

33:00.472 --> 33:02.903
and the position of its parts.

33:02.928 --> 33:05.562
So hearing or not,

33:05.587 --> 33:09.077
your body can still remember how to play.

33:33.548 --> 33:35.888
Don't focus on the sound.

33:35.913 --> 33:39.740
Concentrate on the feel, the vibrations.

33:40.985 --> 33:44.913
Just close your eyes and remember.

33:50.995 --> 33:58.962
♪ ♪

35:06.658 --> 35:08.784
We'll taper off the prednisone,

35:08.809 --> 35:11.443
and your system will purge
it over the next few days.

35:11.468 --> 35:13.148
The side effects will dissipate,

35:13.173 --> 35:15.886
and your blood sugars
will return to normal.

35:15.911 --> 35:18.178
Where are they taking her?

35:18.438 --> 35:20.038
She's turning herself in to the police.

35:20.063 --> 35:22.360
Lauren!

35:22.385 --> 35:26.273
Captain, easy.

35:41.354 --> 35:44.656
We'll get through this...

35:44.681 --> 35:46.721
together.

35:57.261 --> 36:00.794
Dr. Rhodes, how's your patient?

36:00.819 --> 36:04.240
The surgery was successful,
and he should be okay.

36:04.265 --> 36:05.454
Oh, thank God.

36:05.479 --> 36:07.592
Isn't that great news, Mr. Rhodes?

36:07.617 --> 36:10.652
Yes, I had every faith in my son.

36:10.677 --> 36:12.978
That's exactly what I told
the Chairman of the Board

36:13.003 --> 36:15.370
when he dropped by to see me today.

36:15.395 --> 36:17.577
Thank you.

36:17.602 --> 36:19.870
Of course.

36:22.561 --> 36:24.607
Well, looks like we can go.

36:24.632 --> 36:26.776
Thank you very much.

36:28.903 --> 36:31.013
Dolan Rhodes.

36:31.038 --> 36:33.272
That's a big name in Chicago.

36:33.274 --> 36:36.407
Growing up with that can give
a person a skewed perspective,

36:36.432 --> 36:39.500
like whatever he wants, he ought to get.

36:39.577 --> 36:42.612
My dad give you a hard time?

36:42.637 --> 36:46.658
Nothing I couldn't handle.

36:46.683 --> 36:49.201
My grandfather was the one
who started the business.

36:49.226 --> 36:50.392
- Oh?
- Yeah.

36:50.417 --> 36:52.817
Salt of the earth kind of guy.

36:52.842 --> 36:56.389
He used to say to me, "You're gonna have to

36:56.414 --> 36:59.081
"work harder than
everybody else," you know?

36:59.106 --> 37:02.912
"Be better than everybody else
so that you don't turn out

37:02.937 --> 37:04.511
like everybody expects you to."

37:04.537 --> 37:05.785
Hmm.

37:05.810 --> 37:08.673
"So that you don't turn
out like your father."

37:11.986 --> 37:14.187
Took me a while to get that message.

37:14.212 --> 37:19.068
Well, congratulations, Dr. Rhodes.

37:28.052 --> 37:32.789
Dr. Halstead, messenger
just left this for you.

37:33.077 --> 37:35.278
Charvet.

37:37.846 --> 37:42.183
Ooh, someone likes you.

37:42.208 --> 37:44.375
Mm-hmm.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.573
Yep.

37:50.404 --> 37:52.652
Reese.

37:53.864 --> 37:56.252
Treatment 1.

38:04.955 --> 38:06.542
Where's the patient?

38:06.567 --> 38:08.668
- You play golf?
- No.

38:08.693 --> 38:10.884
Me neither. Who's got the time?

38:10.910 --> 38:12.850
There's something that golfers get.

38:12.875 --> 38:15.918
The "yips." Some kind of mental block.

38:15.943 --> 38:17.676
They can't make the simplest putt.

38:17.678 --> 38:19.525
Even really the golfers.

38:19.550 --> 38:21.716
I'm not following this conversation.

38:21.741 --> 38:22.974
You got the yips with needles,

38:22.999 --> 38:25.199
and I'm gonna help you get over it.

38:25.224 --> 38:29.126
Let's get started.

38:29.151 --> 38:32.085
- You want me on...
- Yep. Jab me.

38:32.110 --> 38:35.632
Let's go. I don't have all night.

38:44.361 --> 38:46.757
Mm-hmm.

38:51.546 --> 38:54.949
Dr. Rhodes.

38:54.974 --> 38:56.874
Back in the OR?

38:56.899 --> 38:59.667
Pretty ballsy move,
pushing an attending aside.

38:59.692 --> 39:02.946
Someone with a fragile ego
would've chopped your head off.

39:03.921 --> 39:05.856
Sorry.

39:05.881 --> 39:08.081
Don't apologize.

39:08.106 --> 39:10.244
Never apologize.

39:22.072 --> 39:23.980
How'd it go?

39:24.005 --> 39:25.738
They got everything.

39:25.763 --> 39:27.963
She's gonna be fine.

39:27.988 --> 39:29.821
And her hearing?

39:32.805 --> 39:34.952
I'm sorry.

39:44.031 --> 39:47.054
_

40:01.595 --> 40:05.499
_

40:18.115 --> 40:21.250
So what was in that package you sent me?

40:21.275 --> 40:23.142
Three bars of chocolate:

40:23.167 --> 40:25.567
dark, milk, semisweet.

40:25.592 --> 40:27.913
Wasn't sure which you'd prefer...

40:27.938 --> 40:29.471
And a jar of olives.

40:29.496 --> 40:30.847
Olives?

40:30.872 --> 40:33.973
Well, I know you've been
craving brine these days, so...

40:33.998 --> 40:37.439
An olive branch.

40:37.464 --> 40:40.935
I've got a patient I
got to check on in peds.

40:41.119 --> 40:44.069
You're forgiven.
