00:02.003 --> 00:03.618
Previously on Lost:

00:03.713 --> 00:07.581
- How did you know my father?
- He came to see his daughter.

00:10.261 --> 00:12.547
Her name was... Claire.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.841
We're here to get
a blood sample from you

00:17.935 --> 00:20.472
- and one from your son, Aaron.
- Why?

00:20.563 --> 00:22.645
To determine your relationship
to the child.

00:23.316 --> 00:27.025
- Where are you going, Mommy?
- We're going on vacation, baby.

00:27.111 --> 00:28.442
Wait. You're in LA?

00:29.280 --> 00:31.521
- Of course I can meet.
- Hello, Kate.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.735
- You OK?
- Get me to the car.

00:40.374 --> 00:43.332
- He said you'd been attacked.
- Where's Hurley?

00:43.419 --> 00:46.752
The only way to save the island
is to get your people back here.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.584
But how am I supposed to do that?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.181
- What?
- You...

01:02.313 --> 01:04.645
Do you know what's happening to me?

01:10.988 --> 01:12.068
Charlotte!

01:31.842 --> 01:35.175
- Hey.
- You don't have to whisper.

01:36.639 --> 01:38.345
When he's out, he's out.

01:41.352 --> 01:42.888
At least one of us can sleep.

01:42.979 --> 01:47.097
It's gonna take more than two nights
to get used to sleeping in a normal bed.

01:49.986 --> 01:52.193
What are we going to do about him?

01:53.322 --> 01:54.823
About Aaron.

01:55.741 --> 01:59.359
- I don't know.
- I've been thinking a lot about it.

02:01.289 --> 02:04.497
Did you know Claire was flying
to LA to give him up for adoption?

02:05.543 --> 02:07.750
No... No, I didn't.

02:23.269 --> 02:25.009
I think we should say he's mine.

02:27.690 --> 02:30.807
- What?
- Say that l was six months pregnant

02:30.901 --> 02:34.689
when l was arrested, and I gave birth
on the island. No one would know.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.736
Kate. You don't have to...

02:38.409 --> 02:40.070
There's other ways to do this.

02:40.161 --> 02:44.245
After everyone we've lost...
Michael, Jin and Sawyer...

02:45.166 --> 02:46.781
I can't lose him, too.

02:48.919 --> 02:50.329
Sawyer's not dead.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.836
No.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.629
But he's gone.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.345
Goodnight, Jack.

03:04.769 --> 03:06.430
Kate...

03:09.273 --> 03:10.683
If we're gonna be safe...

03:10.775 --> 03:13.983
If we're going to protect the people
that we left behind,

03:14.070 --> 03:17.062
tomorrow morning l have to
convince everyone to lie.

03:18.115 --> 03:21.232
If it's just me,
they're never gonna go for it.

03:21.327 --> 03:22.988
I'm going to turn to you first.

03:24.747 --> 03:26.362
Are you with me?

03:36.092 --> 03:38.208
l have always been with you.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.231
How does it fit?

03:58.322 --> 04:00.734
It's perfect. Thank you for the loaner.

04:00.825 --> 04:02.406
Looks great on you.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.362
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- It was your idea.

04:07.456 --> 04:08.787
Mommy.

04:10.167 --> 04:13.751
Aaron, honey... Mommy's gonna
run out and do an errand,

04:13.838 --> 04:15.544
I'll be right back, OK?

04:15.631 --> 04:19.044
- And then we can go home.
- Don't worry about us, Kate.

04:19.135 --> 04:22.423
There's candy in the mini-bar
and 100 channels on TV.

04:22.513 --> 04:25.425
We're going to be just fine here.

04:25.516 --> 04:29.600
Sun, I don't know what
I would've done if you weren't here.

04:30.688 --> 04:31.848
Thank you.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.021
It's what any friend would do.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.067
OK, well, I will be back soon.

04:39.155 --> 04:41.988
OK, you be good for Sun. OK, honey?

04:45.161 --> 04:46.617
Good luck.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.621
Delivery for you, Ms. Kwon.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.665
- Thank you.
- Yes.

05:01.510 --> 05:02.966
I'll be right back, honey.

06:19.964 --> 06:21.124
Charlotte?

06:22.132 --> 06:24.623
- Charlotte?
- She's been out for ten minutes!

06:24.718 --> 06:26.003
Stop shouting, James.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.555
- Hey, man.
- Thank you.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.886
If there's something
you want to tell me, Daniel,

06:36.981 --> 06:41.145
- now would be a good time.
- I'm not sure what you mean, exactly.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.442
She's asking why your girlfriend
had a seizure.

06:43.529 --> 06:44.735
Give us some space.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.904
She's like this 'cause
the sky keeps lighting up!

06:46.991 --> 06:50.279
He knew this would happen
and didn't say squat about it.

06:50.369 --> 06:51.529
Go away.

07:01.005 --> 07:03.838
Did you know that this would happen?

07:05.676 --> 07:08.839
I thought... I thought it might.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.343
I think it's neurological.

07:13.434 --> 07:16.426
Our brains have an internal clock,
a sense of time.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.512
The flashes throw the clock off.

07:20.816 --> 07:24.183
It's like really bad jetlag.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.150
Really bad jetlag
doesn't make you hemorrhage.

07:32.077 --> 07:35.285
You want to tell me why it isn't
happening to the rest of us?

07:35.372 --> 07:37.488
I don't know.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.170
But thank God it's not.

07:51.555 --> 07:55.423
Thank you for waiting. Did my assistant
offer you something to drink?

07:55.517 --> 07:59.305
- Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Please, Ms. Austen, sit.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.359
So... how can I help you?

08:07.112 --> 08:10.400
Mr. Norton, when you came to my house,

08:10.491 --> 08:13.733
looking for blood samples
from me and my son,

08:13.827 --> 08:17.866
- | asked you who your client was...
- And I said I couldn't tell you.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.663
Yeah... I'm here to offer you a deal.

08:23.295 --> 08:28.460
I'll give you the blood samples,
but first I want to talk to your client.

08:29.343 --> 08:32.676
Considering what you're asking for,
that's reasonable.

08:33.222 --> 08:36.180
Well, I'm seeing my client later today,

08:36.266 --> 08:38.598
and I will be sure
to pass along your offer.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.928
But I am pretty sure
what the answer's gonna be.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.147
No.

08:46.235 --> 08:49.727
The reason is that you're in
no position to be making any deals,

08:49.822 --> 08:51.187
and we both know it.

08:51.281 --> 08:55.570
l have a signed court order compelling
you to confirm you are the mother.

08:55.661 --> 08:58.698
I could send the sheriff over today
and make you do it,

08:58.789 --> 09:04.785
but my client insists that we
handle the exchange of custody quietly.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.548
What do you mean,
"exchange of custody?"

09:08.632 --> 09:11.544
- You know exactly what I mean.
- No...

09:13.554 --> 09:18.719
Mr. Norton, ljust want to know
who is doing this to me.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.549
You did this to yourself.

09:21.979 --> 09:25.142
Now it is time you prepare yourself,
Ms. Austen.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.646
You are going to lose the boy.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.660
We have to go back to The Orchid.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.125
- Excuse me?
- The Orchid.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.834
That's where all this started,
maybe it's where it will all stop.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.179
That greenhouse is a long ways away.

10:00.851 --> 10:03.263
You had a Zodiac raft back at the beach.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.937
Take that, cut around the island,
be at The Orchid in half the time.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.766
Let me guess. You know
what to do when we get there.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.852
Not exactly, but Ben used it
to leave the island.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.404
And if I can do the same thing,
I believe I can save us.

10:17.201 --> 10:21.865
- And how are you gonna do that?
- This is happening because they left.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.866
lt'll stop if I can bring them back.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.415
- Bring who back?
- Jack, Sun, Sayid, Hugo.

10:27.503 --> 10:28.788
- Kate.
- The boat blew up.

10:28.879 --> 10:31.291
- That chopper was on it.
- They're not dead.

10:31.381 --> 10:35.124
- Says who?
- That doesn't matter.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.676
All that matters is
they've got to come back.

10:37.763 --> 10:40.379
l have to make them come back.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.006
Even if it kills me.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.552
Don't you want them to come back?

10:49.066 --> 10:51.148
Don't you want her to come back?

10:57.115 --> 10:58.776
It doesn't matter what I want.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.244
Hey!

11:02.162 --> 11:03.618
She's waking up!

11:07.751 --> 11:09.036
Are you OK?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.955
- Who are you?
- It's me.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.586
lt's Daniel.

11:20.931 --> 11:21.920
Daniel.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.105
My head.

11:32.693 --> 11:35.275
- What happened?
- There was another flash.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.775
You passed out. How do you feel?

11:39.491 --> 11:41.152
A bit dizzy, but...

11:42.953 --> 11:45.695
- I'm fine.
- Good.

11:45.789 --> 11:49.953
Hooray! Everything's
back to normal. Now what?

11:50.085 --> 11:52.292
I'll tell you now what...

11:54.673 --> 11:56.334
We're going to The Orchid.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.563
Dilation's almost normal.

12:16.653 --> 12:20.066
Good. Now take this lV
out of my arm, and let's go.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.068
You were unconscious for over 42 hours.

12:22.159 --> 12:25.242
You had three doses
of horse tranquilizer in your system.

12:25.329 --> 12:28.071
If you sent that man to
Hurley's house, we have to leave.

12:28.165 --> 12:31.578
Relax. Ben is not going to hurt Hurley.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.953
Ben is on our side.

12:33.837 --> 12:38.171
- The only side he's on is his own.
- Dr. Shephard.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.341
l'm Dr. Ariza,
Director of Clinical Services.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.638
A word with you, please?

12:46.183 --> 12:47.798
I'll be right back.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.765
What do you think you're doing here?

12:52.856 --> 12:56.440
l was treating a patient.
I apologize, it was an emergency.

12:56.526 --> 12:59.359
You were suspended on charges
of substance abuse.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.483
Emergency or not,
you have no business being here.

13:02.574 --> 13:05.782
I understand. I take
full responsibility for my actions.

13:05.869 --> 13:09.282
No! The hospital takes
full responsibility for your actions.

13:09.373 --> 13:11.705
And that makes us liable for them.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.998
Excuse me.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.920
- Hello?
- Jack? It's me...

13:19.007 --> 13:21.043
- Hurley?
- Hey. Did Sayid get to you?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.125
- Did my dad drop him off?
- Yes.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.630
- Where are...
- Is he OK?

13:24.721 --> 13:26.257
- He's fine.
- Awesome.

13:26.348 --> 13:30.682
- Hurley, where are you?
- I'm cool. I'm in LA County lockup.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.852
Tell Sayid I did exactly what he said,
I'm totally safe.

13:33.939 --> 13:37.807
- Ben's never gonna get me now.
- What are you talking about? Hurley...

13:42.489 --> 13:45.822
Good. You're here. How's Sayid?

13:47.744 --> 13:49.609
How you doing today, sir?

13:52.290 --> 13:53.746
Got your meds for ya.

13:54.668 --> 13:59.378
- Sorry, you have the wrong room.
- Nope. Room 133, right?

14:00.465 --> 14:02.171
Got the orders right here.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.749
But don't worry...

14:04.094 --> 14:06.380
...I won't have to
give you an injection.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.637
Put this right in your lV line.

14:33.832 --> 14:37.120
Who are you?
Who are you working for?

14:43.133 --> 14:46.421
- OK, talk, talk.
- The address, it's in my pocket.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.152
Hello, Sayid.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.076
What happened?

15:13.163 --> 15:16.951
Do we know anyone who
lives at 42 Panorama Crest?

15:20.462 --> 15:22.293
That's Kate's address.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.555
- Hello?
- Kate? lt's Jack. Are you OK?

15:42.692 --> 15:45.775
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Where are you now? Are you at home?

15:46.905 --> 15:49.612
- What?
- I'll explain once you're out,

15:49.699 --> 15:52.691
- but you've got to get Aaron and...
- I'm not home, OK?

15:52.786 --> 15:55.949
- Aaron is at a hotel with Sun.
- Sun's in LA?

15:56.039 --> 15:57.620
She's here on business.

15:59.251 --> 16:03.790
Listen, Jack. This is really not a good
time. I'm sorry I picked up the phone...

16:03.880 --> 16:06.747
Kate, do not hang up on me.
Please, listen.

16:08.093 --> 16:10.709
Will you tell me where you are?
I need to see you.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.171
Kate, please.

16:15.892 --> 16:19.805
- l'm downtown. Wilshire and Olive.
- OK. All right, I'm on my way.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.187
She's not at home.
I'm going to her right now.

16:23.275 --> 16:26.517
- Good. I'll go deal with Hugo.
- Sorry, Ben.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.653
- I'm not letting you near him.
- You have friends in trouble.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.982
Let's get them to safety
and save the dirty linen for later.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.120
|'|| drive.

16:39.457 --> 16:43.496
After you get Kate, meet us at
the Long Beach Marina. Slip 23.

16:43.587 --> 16:46.329
And Jack? Hurry.
We're running out of time.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.597
Hey, Locke...

16:57.934 --> 17:00.721
- What are you gonna say to her?
- Sorry?

17:00.812 --> 17:04.680
Kate. What are you gonna say to her
to get her to come back?

17:07.277 --> 17:11.020
- I haven't figured that out yet.
- Well, let me tell you something.

17:11.114 --> 17:14.402
She was excited to hop
on that chopper and get out of here.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.660
What the hell is that?

17:34.304 --> 17:36.795
Whatever it is,
we better stay clear of it.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.840
Beach is this way.

17:41.102 --> 17:47.098
- Now you want to take the scenic route?
- John... do you know when we are?

17:50.654 --> 17:52.645
We need to keep moving.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.916
Hey, how's your headache?

18:15.011 --> 18:19.300
Better. Nothing like sore feet
to take your mind off your head.

18:20.183 --> 18:23.050
Once we get to the beach
we're gonna take the Zodiac

18:23.144 --> 18:25.601
to the other side of the island,
you can rest.

18:25.689 --> 18:28.681
You're sweet, but you don't
need to baby me. I'm fine.

18:32.028 --> 18:36.146
- You OK?
- l'm peachy.

18:38.868 --> 18:39.857
Now what?

18:43.540 --> 18:45.531
Nobody move.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.167
- James...
- I got this.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.470
It's not gonna want me.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.470
lt knows I don't want it
and l was going to give it away.

19:04.561 --> 19:05.801
Babies know that stuff.

19:05.895 --> 19:09.979
OK, no. Hang on. Listen...
Do you want this baby?

19:10.066 --> 19:12.523
Do you want it to be safe and healthy?

19:12.610 --> 19:16.944
You're not alone in this. We're all
here for you. This baby is all of ours.

19:17.032 --> 19:21.571
But I need you to push. OK?

19:22.454 --> 19:24.536
OK? OK.

19:24.622 --> 19:28.285
One... two... three. Push!

19:28.752 --> 19:30.492
Push!

19:30.879 --> 19:32.915
Come on, Claire, push!

19:34.174 --> 19:36.836
OK! OK, we've got
the top of his head.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.133
Push, push! Push, push!

19:40.096 --> 19:42.257
Push, push! Push, push!

20:27.185 --> 20:28.971
James.

20:30.688 --> 20:31.848
What happened?

20:34.734 --> 20:37.146
Did you see something out here, James?

20:44.160 --> 20:45.149
It don't matter.

20:46.955 --> 20:48.240
It's gone now.

21:20.363 --> 21:23.776
- You shaved your beard.
- Yeah.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.698
Just needed a change.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.116
Look, Jack...

21:35.211 --> 21:40.046
I don't know why you called, but I can't
be dealing with this right now.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.595
What's going on?

21:45.180 --> 21:48.468
Nothing. Just...
Can you just go, please?

21:48.558 --> 21:51.425
- Why don't you just tell me?
- Jack, please, just go.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.259
Please, tell me.

21:58.568 --> 22:02.481
- Somebody wants Aaron.
- What?

22:02.572 --> 22:06.781
There's a lawyer in there,
his client... They know we're lying.

22:06.868 --> 22:10.156
They know I'm not his mom,
and they're going to take him away.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.328
Who's going to take him away?

22:17.587 --> 22:20.795
- What are you doing?
- I gotta go. Get in or don't.

22:37.899 --> 22:41.266
Hey. You ready to tell me
who you saw back there?

22:42.320 --> 22:44.436
Already told you. It was nothing.

22:45.532 --> 22:49.866
You and I both know when we were
before the flash, James.

22:49.953 --> 22:53.696
So who was it you saw?
Charlie? Shannon? Yourself?

22:54.582 --> 22:58.450
How is it that you knew when we were,
Johnny Boy?

22:59.128 --> 23:02.291
That light in the sky.
It was from the hatch, wasn't it?

23:04.926 --> 23:06.962
The night that Boone died...

23:08.805 --> 23:11.217
...I went out there,
started pounding on it.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.969
l was confused...

23:14.686 --> 23:16.517
...scared.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.890
Babbling like an idiot.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.478
Asking why was all this happening to me.

23:23.778 --> 23:27.020
- Did you get an answer?
- A light came on,

23:27.115 --> 23:29.151
shot up into the sky.

23:29.242 --> 23:31.949
At the time,
I thought it meant something.

23:32.036 --> 23:35.073
- Did it?
- No. It was just a light.

23:36.457 --> 23:40.496
Why'd you turn us around, then?
Don't you want to go back there?

23:41.170 --> 23:43.001
Why would I want to do that?

23:43.089 --> 23:47.173
So you could tell yourself to
do things different. Save yourself pain.

23:48.553 --> 23:53.092
No, I needed that pain
to get to where I am now.

24:02.066 --> 24:05.775
Hey, I just got a nosebleed.

24:06.696 --> 24:08.311
What? When?

24:09.490 --> 24:12.072
Let's just not freak out the others, OK?

24:13.119 --> 24:15.906
Just tell me, why her? Why me?

24:15.997 --> 24:20.957
I don't know. It might have something
to do with duration of exposure.

24:21.044 --> 24:23.956
- Amount of time spent on the island.
- Doesn't make sense.

24:24.047 --> 24:26.129
Those yahoos have been here for months.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.592
I've never been here
before two weeks ago.

24:29.552 --> 24:32.043
Are you sure about that?

24:32.680 --> 24:34.136
Hello?

24:38.186 --> 24:40.268
The camp's back.

24:40.355 --> 24:43.722
Finally. Anybody for a Dharma beer?

24:45.234 --> 24:47.691
Hello?! Anybody here?

24:47.779 --> 24:49.565
Rose?! Bernard?!

24:57.205 --> 24:59.366
I wonder how long ago this happened.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.370
Son of a bitch!

25:07.590 --> 25:08.670
What is it?

25:09.842 --> 25:10.831
lt's Vincent's.

25:10.927 --> 25:15.170
Well, where's the rest of the dog?
Where's the rest of our people?

25:18.393 --> 25:20.349
The Zodiac's gone, too.

25:21.104 --> 25:23.345
Maybe your people took the boat.

25:23.439 --> 25:25.521
Why the hell would they do that?

25:26.567 --> 25:28.774
To get away from whoever came in those.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.158
Where did these come from?

25:37.829 --> 25:40.491
That's a good question.
They're pretty old.

25:40.581 --> 25:44.244
- Not that old.
- Let me see that.

25:46.963 --> 25:50.581
- Ajira.
- Ajira. It's an airline.

25:50.675 --> 25:53.132
It's based out of India.
They fly everywhere.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.881
Great. Maybe they got a flight
out of here to Vegas.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.008
Who came in these? Other Others?

25:59.142 --> 26:00.222
Don't look at me.

26:01.310 --> 26:04.052
My question is:
When are they coming back?

26:04.147 --> 26:05.683
Let's not wait to find out.

26:33.176 --> 26:36.418
This plan sounded better
when we were going by motorboat.

26:38.473 --> 26:39.838
How far is this place?

26:39.932 --> 26:44.096
Around that point.
Not more than a couple hours.

26:44.187 --> 26:45.893
Oh, joy.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.194
You all right?

26:53.654 --> 26:55.986
- I saw Kate.
- What?

26:56.073 --> 26:58.906
Last night... in the jungle.

27:00.453 --> 27:01.818
Before the last flash.

27:05.041 --> 27:07.874
She was delivering Claire's baby.

27:09.462 --> 27:10.827
That was two months ago.

27:13.216 --> 27:14.877
Time travel's a bitch.

27:15.384 --> 27:16.715
Get down!

27:19.222 --> 27:20.337
Paddle!

27:23.559 --> 27:26.392
- I think they want their boat back.
- Row!

27:33.861 --> 27:36.568
- These your people?
- No. Are they yours?

27:36.656 --> 27:38.192
Shut up and keep paddling!

27:44.455 --> 27:46.286
Little help!

27:54.215 --> 27:57.207
Paddle harder, they're getting closer.

28:03.266 --> 28:05.257
Thank you, Lord!

28:14.527 --> 28:16.313
I take that back!

28:16.404 --> 28:19.066
Everybody paddle, head for the shore.

28:42.638 --> 28:46.256
Kate, just because the guy
told you he was meeting his client,

28:46.350 --> 28:50.138
doesn't mean they're here. He
could've told you that to throw you off.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.844
Or they're in that hotel now.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.271
OK. And what if they are?

28:58.362 --> 29:02.196
What if the person who wants to take
Aaron is sitting in that room now?

29:02.283 --> 29:05.070
Then what?

29:05.161 --> 29:10.121
Come with me. We'll get Aaron, put our
heads together, figure something out.

29:11.334 --> 29:13.165
No, l...

29:22.345 --> 29:23.585
Oh, my God.

29:25.514 --> 29:26.924
That's Claire's mother.

29:55.086 --> 29:57.168
- Wait.
- What am | waiting for, Jack?

29:57.254 --> 29:59.506
Wait... Let's just think about this.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.126
- She knows.
- Maybe she doesn't.

30:01.217 --> 30:04.550
She knows about Aaron,
and that's all that matters.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.218
Yeah.

30:08.557 --> 30:10.809
- Let me go talk to her.
- What?

30:10.893 --> 30:13.134
lfl can just explain to her
why we did it,

30:13.229 --> 30:16.187
maybe if I can
get her to understand why...

30:17.566 --> 30:19.352
She'll listen to me.

30:21.779 --> 30:24.486
I can fix this, Kate. I can fix it.

30:27.243 --> 30:28.904
Hey...

30:30.121 --> 30:32.328
Aaron is my family, too.

31:03.904 --> 31:08.113
- Dr. Shephard?
- Hello, Ms. Littleton...

31:09.744 --> 31:11.860
- May I come in?
- Of course.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.871
- You're drenched.
- No, I'm fine.

31:19.962 --> 31:23.955
God, I haven't seen you
since your father's funeral.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.707
How did you even know I was here?

31:28.929 --> 31:31.591
I knew you were here, Ms. Littleton...

31:32.475 --> 31:35.182
...because I followed your lawyer.

31:37.104 --> 31:38.685
Why would you do that?

31:39.398 --> 31:41.980
I did it because...

31:42.735 --> 31:46.319
I understand that you
feel the need to do this.

31:46.405 --> 31:50.273
But I need you to know
that everything Kate and l have done,

31:50.367 --> 31:51.823
it was for Aaron.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.201
Who's Aaron?

32:02.004 --> 32:04.245
I'm afraid I'm not following you.

32:04.340 --> 32:06.752
Ms. Littleton...

32:06.842 --> 32:09.254
...what are you doing here
in Los Angeles?

32:17.686 --> 32:22.055
Let's go. Drive. Call Sun. Tell her to
bring Aaron to the Long Beach Marina.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.606
- What are you talking...
- We have to go now.

32:24.693 --> 32:27.275
I'm not going until
you tell me what happened!

32:27.363 --> 32:29.024
She doesn't know anything.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.827
- What?
- She doesn't know.

32:33.911 --> 32:37.028
She still thinks that Claire is dead.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.996
She doesn't know Aaron exists.

32:40.084 --> 32:41.995
- But the lawyer?
- She sued Oceanic.

32:42.086 --> 32:44.168
She's in town to pick up her settlement.

32:44.255 --> 32:48.840
It's a coincidence her lawyer happens to
be the same one trying to take my son?

32:48.926 --> 32:50.837
I don't know.

32:50.928 --> 32:54.841
But whoever is trying to take Aaron...
it's not her.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.886
Then who is it?

33:02.606 --> 33:04.517
Can I ask you something?

33:06.861 --> 33:09.318
Why did you take it upon yourself
to rescue Hugo?

33:10.573 --> 33:12.780
I had to make sure Hurley was safe.

33:14.034 --> 33:15.319
Pull in over here.

33:40.853 --> 33:43.185
- Mr. Linus.
- Mr. Norton.

33:44.607 --> 33:48.350
I looked into it. They don't have
any solid case against Reyes.

33:48.444 --> 33:51.402
The ME said that the man
found outside Santa Rosa

33:51.488 --> 33:55.731
- was killed before Reyes escaped.
- That's very good news.

33:55.826 --> 34:00.035
We have a prelim hearing in the morning.
The judge'll never let it get past that.

34:00.122 --> 34:01.783
Reyes will be a free man.

34:03.876 --> 34:05.867
- Thank you, Dan.
- Anytime.

34:12.218 --> 34:13.298
Who was that?

34:15.512 --> 34:17.013
That's my lawyer.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.311
OK.

34:27.149 --> 34:29.060
Remind me never to do that again.

34:32.196 --> 34:35.654
- Where are we?
- It's hard to say till it gets light.

34:47.336 --> 34:50.078
We didn't get a chance
to finish our conversation.

34:50.172 --> 34:52.208
What conversation was that?

34:52.841 --> 34:55.127
The one before they started
shooting at us.

34:55.219 --> 34:59.178
Where you were about to tell me
about how it felt to see Kate again.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.801
I wasn't about to tell you anything.

35:03.519 --> 35:05.555
Why don't you tell me now?

35:21.704 --> 35:24.036
l was close enough to touch her.

35:29.044 --> 35:34.209
If I wanted to, I could've
stood right up and talked to her.

35:36.719 --> 35:38.459
Why didn't you?

35:42.850 --> 35:44.715
What's done is done.

35:53.068 --> 35:56.811
- Juliet...
- What's wrong?

36:04.538 --> 36:06.199
Come and look at this.

36:14.798 --> 36:18.256
lt's wreckage.
Looks like itjust happened.

36:28.604 --> 36:30.686
Anybody speak French?

38:07.077 --> 38:08.942
Jack, why did you call me today?

38:11.039 --> 38:14.122
I told you. l was worried...

38:15.210 --> 38:17.747
Why were you worried? Why today?

38:29.475 --> 38:32.308
- I don't...
- Before I called, Sayid was attacked.

38:32.394 --> 38:35.807
The guy that did it,
your address was in his pocket.

38:35.898 --> 38:37.934
Sayid? What's he doing here?

38:39.902 --> 38:41.642
That's not important right now.

38:41.737 --> 38:45.275
What matters is that we get
you and Aaron someplace safe.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.731
Safe from who?

39:01.256 --> 39:02.757
Hello, Kate.

39:10.557 --> 39:13.424
It's OK. He's with me.

39:16.063 --> 39:19.226
- He's with you?
- I know this is hard to understand...

39:20.275 --> 39:22.732
...but he's here to help us.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.356
To help everyone that we left behind.

39:26.323 --> 39:28.154
We all need to be together again.

39:28.242 --> 39:31.450
- lt's him.
- What?

39:32.663 --> 39:35.575
lt's him. He's the one
who's trying to take Aaron.

39:35.666 --> 39:38.123
- No. You don't understand...
- She's right.

39:39.711 --> 39:40.791
It was me.

39:44.091 --> 39:45.456
Sorry.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.420
Who the hell do you think you are?

39:48.512 --> 39:52.004
Why don't you stay away? Why don't
you leave me and my son alone?

39:52.099 --> 39:54.636
Because he's not your son, Kate.

40:33.348 --> 40:34.337
Four, 8...

40:47.070 --> 40:49.857
- No understand.
- You speak English?

40:51.783 --> 40:53.068
A little.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.952
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

40:58.373 --> 40:59.533
How did you get here?

41:01.376 --> 41:02.627
Boat.

41:08.008 --> 41:09.043
What boat?

41:11.011 --> 41:12.797
It's gone.

41:13.847 --> 41:14.836
Sink.

41:14.931 --> 41:17.388
He must have been caught
in the same storm as us.

41:17.476 --> 41:19.091
Who are you?

41:19.186 --> 41:22.519
- How long you were in the water?
- I don't know.

41:23.023 --> 41:26.140
How do you not know how you wound up
in the middle of the ocean?

41:54.888 --> 41:56.094
Thank you.

41:58.684 --> 41:59.764
What is your name?

42:01.269 --> 42:03.009
Kwon Jin Soo.

42:05.107 --> 42:07.439
- Jin.
- Hello, Jin.

42:08.402 --> 42:11.439
l'm Danielle. Danielle Rousseau.
