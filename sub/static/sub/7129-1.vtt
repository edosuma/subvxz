[Ding]

01:05.000 --> 01:06.709
What are you doing?

01:06.709 --> 01:08.291
Bev, what are you doing?

01:08.291 --> 01:09.542
Stop.
No.

01:09.542 --> 01:10.875
Please.
No!

01:10.875 --> 01:12.875
I'm going home.
You stay.

01:12.875 --> 01:14.333
You're obviously
flourishing here.

01:14.333 --> 01:16.542
Is this because
I went surfing today?

01:16.542 --> 01:18.750
OK, obviously it's not
because I went surfing.

01:18.750 --> 01:20.792
Bev, come on, talk to me.

01:20.792 --> 01:23.000
Bev. Bev!

01:23.000 --> 01:25.083
Look, I realize L.A.
hasn't exactly been
your favorite--

01:25.083 --> 01:27.917
This isn't about L.A.

01:27.917 --> 01:30.208
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Front door ajar.

01:30.208 --> 01:31.583
Wait. Is it
about the show?

01:31.583 --> 01:33.500
It's one more day of shooting,
a week in post.

01:33.500 --> 01:34.959
Move.

01:34.959 --> 01:36.917
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Front door ajar.

01:36.917 --> 01:38.291
One week. Then the work
will be done,

01:38.291 --> 01:41.208
and we can both
leave together, with
our heads held high.

01:41.208 --> 01:42.458
Heads held high?

01:42.458 --> 01:44.125
Have you not seen
our heads?

01:44.125 --> 01:46.500
It's all we can do
to not kick them
when we walk.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.041
All right, look, we've
made some compromises--

01:48.041 --> 01:50.834
This isn't about
the fucking show.

01:50.834 --> 01:52.583
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Front door ajar.

01:52.583 --> 01:54.250
Well, then what is it about?

01:54.250 --> 01:56.125
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Front door ajar.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.166
Does this bitch
ever shut up?!

01:58.166 --> 01:59.542
You know what
this is about.

01:59.542 --> 02:01.291
What?

02:01.291 --> 02:05.041
Morning? Oh, my God!
Look, I'm telling you,

02:05.041 --> 02:07.083
I have no interest
in her at all.

02:07.083 --> 02:10.291
I saw you wanking to her
the other night.

02:11.291 --> 02:13.959
What? I--No, I--
How did--

02:13.959 --> 02:16.875
How did? Who did?
I--I--

02:16.875 --> 02:18.792
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Front door ajar...

02:18.792 --> 02:20.625
[Machinery droning]
All right!

02:20.625 --> 02:22.625
There may have been
a little wanking!

02:22.625 --> 02:24.375
But there is
nothing between us.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.583
I just saw you with her.
What?!

02:26.583 --> 02:28.166
I saw you with her
just now!

02:28.166 --> 02:30.709
I saw you hugging her
in front of our house!

02:30.709 --> 02:33.834
She wasn't here! She--

02:33.834 --> 02:35.542
There was--She wasn't--

02:35.542 --> 02:37.542
Ernesto!

02:37.542 --> 02:39.625
Ernesto!
What?

02:39.625 --> 02:41.458
Please turn that off!

02:41.458 --> 02:42.875
[Turns off]

02:42.875 --> 02:44.500
I'm sorry.
Did you want me?

02:44.500 --> 02:46.333
I want you to turn off
the leaf blower.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.166
I did.
Yeah.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.667
Now. But before--

02:50.667 --> 02:51.750
Hey, Bev!

02:51.750 --> 02:53.458
No! No! Wait!

02:54.667 --> 02:56.709
Bev, stop!

02:56.709 --> 02:58.166
You're on the wrong side!

02:58.166 --> 03:00.625
No, Sean--
you're on the wrong side!

03:00.625 --> 03:02.542
That's not what I meant!

WOMAN: Hello?

03:27.291 --> 03:29.208
Hey, Ma. It's Matt.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.166
Nothing. Just calling
to say hi.

MAN: There you are!

04:04.083 --> 04:07.166
Oh, you bloody bastards.
You've done it again.

04:07.166 --> 04:09.041
[Laughs] And again!

04:09.041 --> 04:10.583
Stop doing it!

04:10.583 --> 04:11.917
We're so sorry

04:11.917 --> 04:13.917
We promise, never again.

04:13.917 --> 04:16.250
Yeah, you fuckers.
That's what you said
last year.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.250
[Chuckles] No, no.
Honestly, I'm--

04:18.250 --> 04:19.875
I'm, you know,
really pleased for you.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.959
BEVERLY: That's sweet.
Thank you.

04:22.959 --> 04:24.667
Oh, he's so
not pleased.

04:24.667 --> 04:25.959
[Laughs]
No, he's not.

04:25.959 --> 04:27.875
Well, I'm happy
for us.

04:27.875 --> 04:30.583
I'm just...happy.

04:30.583 --> 04:31.917
[Laughs]

04:34.166 --> 04:36.792
How soon can we leave?
Don't know.

04:36.792 --> 04:39.083
Have we made enough people
feel bad about themselves?

04:39.083 --> 04:41.041
[Laughs]
Oh, my God.

04:41.041 --> 04:42.750
What? Who's that?

04:42.750 --> 04:44.000
That's Merc Lapidus.
Who?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.417
Merc Lapidus.

04:45.417 --> 04:46.834
Repeating it
doesn't help me.

04:46.834 --> 04:48.709
From America.
He's president of--

04:48.709 --> 04:50.250
Winners! Ha ha!

04:50.250 --> 04:51.375
Forgive me. Don't want
to interrupt.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.583
Merc Lapidus.
I am the president--

04:53.583 --> 04:55.792
Please. We know
who you are.

04:55.792 --> 04:57.500
Hi, Sean and Beverly--

04:57.500 --> 04:58.792
Ahh!

04:58.792 --> 05:00.625
Ha ha ha!

05:00.625 --> 05:02.959
And you, with
the funny speech.

05:02.959 --> 05:04.542
Oh, that's not necess--

05:04.542 --> 05:06.208
Oh, all right.
Ha ha!

05:06.208 --> 05:08.250
You know what
my fantasy is?

05:08.250 --> 05:10.417
I'm gonna guess.
Either shoes or nuns.

05:10.417 --> 05:11.625
[Laughs]

05:11.625 --> 05:14.333
My fantasy is,
I wake up tomorrow,

05:14.333 --> 05:16.583
and I've got your show
on my network.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.333
Well, that's
very flattering.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.250
No, no, I'm not just
blowing smoke here.

05:20.250 --> 05:22.917
I love your show.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.291
I love it.
Seriously...

05:24.291 --> 05:25.792
I want to have sex
with your show.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.291
[Laughs] Well.

05:27.291 --> 05:28.834
I'm telling you--
an American version

05:28.834 --> 05:30.291
would be huge.

05:30.291 --> 05:33.000
It could be, like,
The Office  meets...

05:33.000 --> 05:35.208
Our show?
Yes! Ha ha!

05:35.208 --> 05:37.834
But--But we'd have
to do it right.

05:37.834 --> 05:40.792
No farming this one
out to some shitty
American writers.

05:40.792 --> 05:44.417
I want what's in these
amazing Britishy heads!

05:44.417 --> 05:47.166
What, us, come to L.A.?

05:47.166 --> 05:49.375
That's interesting.
Is it?

05:49.375 --> 05:51.667
Uh-oh. She's giving you
the wife look.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.709
[Laughs] Whoa! Now she's
giving me the wife look!

05:53.709 --> 05:54.834
Oh, hello.

05:56.125 --> 05:58.000
Have you guys
tried these?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.667
Ohh. What are these
little berries?

06:00.667 --> 06:03.917
They're genius!
They're, like...
magic berries.

06:03.917 --> 06:05.583
They're actually
loganberries.

06:05.583 --> 06:06.834
[British accent]
Loganberries!

06:06.834 --> 06:08.166
Now I want
to have sex

06:08.166 --> 06:10.000
with your show
and these berries.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.333
When I was a little girl,
my grandmother
lived in Yorkshire

06:12.333 --> 06:14.333
and had loganberries
in her garden.

06:14.333 --> 06:17.250
Every summer we'd
pick the berries

06:17.250 --> 06:19.375
and she'd make jam.
Fuck.

06:19.375 --> 06:22.041
My grandmother lives in
Morristown, New Jersey,

06:22.041 --> 06:24.709
and hates
black people.

06:24.709 --> 06:25.959
So, what do
you say?

06:25.959 --> 06:28.166
Come play
with us, hmm?

06:28.166 --> 06:29.709
I need
Lyman's Boys.

06:29.709 --> 06:31.375
We've got four places
on my schedule

06:31.375 --> 06:32.875
I could put it
right now.

06:32.875 --> 06:34.333
This is
very flattering.

06:34.333 --> 06:35.792
And we've all had
a bit to drink.

06:35.792 --> 06:37.542
No, not me.
Not in seven years.

06:37.542 --> 06:38.875
I'm an alcoholic.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.208
But evidently
not anonymous.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.834
[Both chuckle]

06:42.834 --> 06:44.375
Come on.

06:44.375 --> 06:46.959
We'll get you
a house, a car.

06:46.959 --> 06:48.875
Name it. How hard
could it be?

06:48.875 --> 06:50.208
You've already
written the scripts.

06:50.208 --> 06:51.542
It's perfect
the way it is.

06:51.542 --> 06:53.125
You work
20 minutes a day,

06:53.125 --> 06:54.166
the rest of the time,

06:54.166 --> 06:55.750
you could screw
in the pool.

06:55.750 --> 06:58.333
Oh, you hear that?
We'd get a pool.

06:58.333 --> 07:01.417
Look, if you don't
want to do it,
that's fine.

07:01.417 --> 07:02.917
Hey, maybe you
don't like money.

07:02.917 --> 07:05.333
But I had to ask.

07:05.333 --> 07:07.875
When I had cancer--

07:07.875 --> 07:09.083
That's right.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.917
I realized two things.

07:10.917 --> 07:13.417
If you want something,
go for it.

07:13.417 --> 07:15.291
God doesn't wait for you.

07:15.291 --> 07:17.500
And also...

07:17.500 --> 07:19.625
you do not want cancer.

07:32.041 --> 07:34.291
You're already there,
aren't you?
No.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.875
Yes, you are.
You're having brunch
with Angelina Jolie.

07:36.875 --> 07:39.959
My God, you're already
starting to tan.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.000
[Laughs]

07:42.000 --> 07:44.125
Aren't you?
No.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.458
BEVERLY: Thank you.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.500
Good night.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.333
Ooh!

07:59.083 --> 08:00.583
Jesus.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.291
"Come taste our berries.

08:05.291 --> 08:07.792
Your biggest fan,
Merc Lapidus."

08:07.792 --> 08:10.792
How did he do this?
We left him less than
an hour ago.

08:10.792 --> 08:12.458
I can't believe
he even remembered

08:12.458 --> 08:14.166
that stupid
loganberry story.

08:14.166 --> 08:16.583
I can't believe
he knows where we live.

08:21.166 --> 08:24.000
You really want
to move to L.A.?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.959
You're always taking
the piss out of it.

08:25.959 --> 08:27.458
Only because it's
never wanted me.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.500
I'm very petty
that way.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.166
But why do it?
Our lives are here,

08:32.166 --> 08:34.000
our friends are here.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.625
Who would you miss?

08:35.625 --> 08:37.667
[Thunder]

08:39.166 --> 08:40.709
We need better friends.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.625
What I'm saying is,
if we do this,

08:44.625 --> 08:47.041
and we're a hit--
a hit show in the States--

08:47.041 --> 08:48.333
a big, stonking hit--

08:48.333 --> 08:49.709
it's like winning
the lottery.

08:49.709 --> 08:51.333
We'd never have
to work again.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.083
What would we do
instead?

08:53.083 --> 08:56.083
All right,
we need friends,
and we need hobbies.

08:56.083 --> 08:57.792
I don't know.

08:57.792 --> 08:59.834
L.A.--
it's just so...

08:59.834 --> 09:01.417
L.A.

09:01.417 --> 09:04.041
Oh, come on,
it's an adventure.

09:04.041 --> 09:06.000
I'd have to drive!

09:06.000 --> 09:08.667
[Laughs] There's that
pioneer spirit!

09:14.125 --> 09:16.583
You really want this?

09:16.583 --> 09:18.667
I think I do.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.667
Hooray!

09:26.583 --> 09:28.875
Wait, wait, wait.
I get to do the bra, too.

09:28.875 --> 09:30.291
[Laughs]

09:30.291 --> 09:32.041
You're still 14, aren't you?

09:32.041 --> 09:34.041
I wish I got
to do this at 14.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.333
[She laughs]

09:35.333 --> 09:36.750
Wait, did you
weld this?

09:38.083 --> 09:39.250
[Beverly laughing]

09:46.166 --> 09:48.917
Now, you have
to admit...

09:48.917 --> 09:51.709
BEVERLY: It is fairly glorious.

09:53.083 --> 09:56.083
Feel that sunshine!

09:56.083 --> 09:57.250
Of course--

09:57.250 --> 09:59.291
Don't say
"skin cancer"!

10:00.917 --> 10:02.875
Just glorious.

10:02.875 --> 10:07.291
â™ª Oh, say,
can you see-- â™ª
No, no. Don't. Don't.

10:11.834 --> 10:13.917
Oh, my.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.208
Fancy!

10:15.208 --> 10:17.709
SEAN: Welcome home, darling.
[Laughs]

10:21.417 --> 10:23.208
Hello. We're
the new people

10:23.208 --> 10:24.417
moving into...

10:24.417 --> 10:27.291
1675 Bel Vista Drive.

10:27.291 --> 10:29.333
Sean and Beverly
Lincoln.

10:34.208 --> 10:36.208
No.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.166
No? Well,
we should be there.

10:38.166 --> 10:39.500
Were they
expecting you?

10:39.500 --> 10:40.625
No, no, there's
no one expecting us.

10:40.625 --> 10:41.834
It's a house
we're renting.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.125
Well, it's being
rented for us.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.208
Wait, there's the housekeep.
She might be there.

10:45.208 --> 10:46.166
Yeah.

10:46.166 --> 10:47.750
One moment.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.125
Is this right?

10:50.125 --> 10:51.542
I have, uh...

10:51.542 --> 10:53.583
Sean and Beverly Lincoln.

10:53.583 --> 10:55.625
Sean and Beverly
Lincoln here.

10:59.834 --> 11:01.583
She says they're
not home right now.

11:01.583 --> 11:04.166
[Laughs] Well, of course
they're not home!

11:04.166 --> 11:07.250
Because they're us.
And we're stuck here with you.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.667
Ma'am, there's no need
to raise your voice.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.542
Oh, really?
Get in the car.

11:10.542 --> 11:12.333
I'll be you, and we'll
see if that's true.

11:12.333 --> 11:13.458
Look, um, Wallace,

11:13.458 --> 11:15.041
I'm sure once
we've moved in,

11:15.041 --> 11:17.000
the three of us
will have a really
good laugh about this.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.291
But, right now, we've
been traveling for...

11:19.291 --> 11:20.834
14 hours.
14 hours.

11:20.834 --> 11:23.166
And we'd really love
to get into the house.

11:23.166 --> 11:24.875
Isn't there any way
you could let us do that?

11:24.875 --> 11:26.500
Not if you're not
on the list.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.333
How do I know
who you are?

11:28.333 --> 11:29.583
Oh! Has it not come up?

11:29.583 --> 11:31.166
We're Sean
and Beverly Lincoln!

11:31.166 --> 11:33.166
Really not helping.
Really don't care!

11:36.625 --> 11:38.834
I'm sure we're on the list.
May I see it?

11:38.834 --> 11:41.250
No one sees the list.
No one sees the list?

11:41.250 --> 11:43.834
We have very high-caliber
celebrities living here.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.417
We have to protect
their privacy.

11:45.417 --> 11:47.083
Oh, for God's sake,
Wallace--

11:47.083 --> 11:49.208
I appreciate the seriousness
with which you do your job.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.125
I do. But I just want
to find our names.

11:52.125 --> 11:53.375
Now, I promise you,

11:53.375 --> 11:54.875
I won't reveal
any information

11:54.875 --> 11:56.709
about your precious
gated community

11:56.709 --> 11:59.709
or the secret identities
of the gated citizens.

11:59.709 --> 12:02.250
Now, give me the list.

12:07.667 --> 12:09.417
Ooh, RenÃ©e Zellweger
lives here.

12:09.417 --> 12:11.166
Does she?
Yeah.

12:29.542 --> 12:31.375
This is just
for the two of us?

12:31.375 --> 12:33.709
[Laughs]
Apparently so.

12:33.709 --> 12:36.208
Our show's not this good.
[Laughs]

12:40.667 --> 12:42.875
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Front door ajar.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.083
Front door ajar.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.375
She's fun.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.208
Front door ajar.

12:54.583 --> 12:57.125
Bloody hell.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.083
It's even bigger
inside.

12:59.083 --> 13:02.250
And you were afraid
we weren't gonna have
enough staircases.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.875
This is mad.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.333
Woy!

13:08.333 --> 13:09.750
[Laughs]
Look at this.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.500
It's very Hollywood.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.792
Yeah.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.959
And, construction-wise,
a little disturbing.

13:14.959 --> 13:16.667
Ha!

13:18.625 --> 13:22.417
BEVERLY: Oh, my God.

13:22.417 --> 13:26.125
I am never leaving
this room.

13:26.125 --> 13:28.291
I like a bath
you can dock a barge in.

13:28.291 --> 13:29.959
[Laughs]

13:29.959 --> 13:32.250
Big enough for two.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.542
What, now?

13:33.542 --> 13:36.041
I'm feeling a bit...
dirty.

13:36.041 --> 13:38.083
You?
Filthy.

13:40.333 --> 13:43.083
Say, you want to
dock that barge?

13:43.083 --> 13:44.583
Oh, always a lady.

13:44.583 --> 13:46.333
[Laughs]

13:46.333 --> 13:47.500
Let's do this.

14:21.959 --> 14:24.333
Well, maybe
some other time.
Yeah.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.041
[Phone ringing, chatter]

14:44.709 --> 14:47.166
Oh, and don't forget to get
your parking validated

14:47.166 --> 14:49.041
before you leave.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.917
Merc really wanted
to be here,

14:50.917 --> 14:53.250
but he had to be
in New York.

14:55.166 --> 14:59.291
Sean and Beverly,
this is Andy Button,
our head of casting.

14:59.291 --> 15:02.417
Huge fan. Oh, my God.

15:02.417 --> 15:04.166
I've just been watching
tapes of your show.

15:04.166 --> 15:06.625
Beyond hysterical.
Beyond.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.709
And Myra Licht,
head of comedy.

15:08.709 --> 15:11.250
It's really funny.

15:11.250 --> 15:14.667
There you go.
Sit, sit, sit.

15:14.667 --> 15:17.375
So, are you
settling in?

15:17.375 --> 15:18.750
Some house, huh?

15:18.750 --> 15:20.208
SEAN: Ohh!
It's insane.

15:20.208 --> 15:22.000
The only thing that's
missing is a moat.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.500
Well, get a big rating,
Merc will dig you a moat.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.417
She's not kidding.
[Laughs]

15:26.417 --> 15:28.709
So, do you all your writers
get houses like that?

15:28.709 --> 15:29.750
Oh, no!

15:29.750 --> 15:31.250
No, no, no.

15:31.250 --> 15:33.208
We just finished
shooting a reality
show there,

15:33.208 --> 15:34.792
and we had six weeks
left on the lease,

15:34.792 --> 15:36.750
and we needed a place
for you guys.

15:36.750 --> 15:39.792
If you get bored,
you can vote
each other off.

15:39.792 --> 15:42.500
Oh, well, that would
explain the columns.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.500
Several of them are
made of polystyrene.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.208
They're probably left over
from some set.

15:47.208 --> 15:48.959
They use that house for
a lot of reality shows.

15:48.959 --> 15:50.500
They shot a season of
The Bachelor  there,

15:50.500 --> 15:52.750
and, I think
The Apprentice L.A.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.875
We just had 12 girls
living there,

15:54.875 --> 15:56.291
competing to become
a supermodel.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.667
Right, the bathroom
did have a vague
vomity smell.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.250
That would be why.
Ha ha ha!

16:01.250 --> 16:04.458
So, Lyman's Boys.

16:04.458 --> 16:05.834
Ohh! Ha ha ha!

16:05.834 --> 16:07.750
Let's talk about casting.

16:07.750 --> 16:09.834
Well, we already have
Julian committed

16:09.834 --> 16:11.125
to recreate
the role of Lyman,

16:11.125 --> 16:13.041
so that's half the battle
right there.

16:13.041 --> 16:15.458
We love Julian!

16:15.458 --> 16:17.000
Comic god.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.583
He's hilarious.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.875
We just need
to find a time when
he can fly over

16:21.875 --> 16:23.625
and audition
for Merc.

16:23.625 --> 16:25.208
Audition?

16:25.208 --> 16:27.208
No one gets cast
in anything

16:27.208 --> 16:28.667
without Merc
seeing them first.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.667
[Laughs]
That's mad.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.834
Merc loves the show.
Julian is the show.

16:32.834 --> 16:35.333
Why...should he
have to audition?

16:38.041 --> 16:40.625
Yeah, um...

16:40.625 --> 16:43.083
there is a chance

16:43.083 --> 16:46.667
Merc may not have
actually seen your show.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.458
What?
What?

16:48.458 --> 16:50.333
I'm not saying that
he hasn't seen it.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.208
Has he seen it?
No.

16:52.208 --> 16:55.875
Hang on. He told us
he loved it.

16:55.875 --> 16:58.500
He said he wanted
to have sex with it.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.750
[Laughter]

16:59.750 --> 17:01.375
Well, if I had
a nickel

17:01.375 --> 17:04.542
for everything Merc
would have sex with,
sight unseen...

17:04.542 --> 17:05.792
She'd have
a lot of nickels.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.166
I'd be rich.
Ha ha ha!

17:08.166 --> 17:09.834
Then what about it
did he love?

17:09.834 --> 17:12.166
Uh, hello? It's a hit!

17:12.166 --> 17:14.959
It wins awards.
It ran for four years.

17:16.125 --> 17:17.709
Unbelievable.

17:17.709 --> 17:19.333
We have all seen it,

17:19.333 --> 17:21.542
and we do love it.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.834
Major love.
Mm-hm.

17:25.542 --> 17:28.834
Merc's never seen
the show?

17:30.375 --> 17:32.083
I can't--

17:32.083 --> 17:33.250
I mean, that's--

17:35.041 --> 17:36.291
Help me.

17:36.291 --> 17:37.875
You're articulating it
perfectly.

17:37.875 --> 17:42.000
Which is why he really
needs to see Julian read.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.125
But we've already
offered him the part.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.667
He gave up a play
in the West End
to do this.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.291
I hear you, I do.

17:48.291 --> 17:51.750
And I am sure Merc
will just flip over him.

17:51.750 --> 17:55.208
I mean, my God!
It's Julian...

17:55.208 --> 17:56.875
Bullard.
Bullard.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.917
Can't Merc just watch
some tapes of the show?

17:59.917 --> 18:02.625
It's better if we
do it in person.

18:02.625 --> 18:05.375
He's not a big
TV-watcher.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.583
And if we say no?

18:09.583 --> 18:11.208
[Sighs]

18:13.083 --> 18:15.834
You don't want
to say no to Merc.

18:15.834 --> 18:17.083
Mmm.

18:17.083 --> 18:20.417
You really want him
on your team.

18:20.417 --> 18:22.917
I thought he was
on our team.

18:22.917 --> 18:24.875
Totally. Ha!

18:24.875 --> 18:28.542
But if he likes Julian--
and he will--

18:28.542 --> 18:31.709
you're pretty much
guaranteed you're
on the air.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.291
He already guaranteed
we were on the air.

18:33.291 --> 18:34.709
Absolutely!

18:34.709 --> 18:38.125
[Laughs]
But, you know,
nothing's in stone.

18:38.125 --> 18:39.500
Actually, Merc said
this was in stone.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.917
And it is.
But, you know...

18:41.917 --> 18:44.083
Clearly,
we don't know.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.083
It's in stone, but...

18:47.625 --> 18:49.083
...stone--Ha ha!

18:49.083 --> 18:51.458
There's things
stronger than stone.

18:51.458 --> 18:53.125
Like what?

18:53.125 --> 18:55.542
Like Merc.
Yeah, Merc.

18:55.542 --> 18:57.583
Merc is stronger
than stone.

19:01.125 --> 19:03.625
BEVERLY: It's outrageous!
No, I know.

19:03.625 --> 19:05.959
He has to audition--
the man has played
the part for four years!

19:05.959 --> 19:08.041
It's insane!
What are you eating?

19:08.041 --> 19:10.041
Nuts from the plane.
They're awful.

19:10.041 --> 19:12.166
Do you want some?
Sure.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.083
Hello, Wallace.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.750
And you're here
to see...?

19:26.959 --> 19:28.667
Hmm. Heh.

19:30.625 --> 19:31.959
Oh, I remember
this scene.

19:31.959 --> 19:33.208
It's rather good.

19:33.208 --> 19:35.750
Julian, thank you again
for doing this.

19:35.750 --> 19:37.667
We're horrified you even
need to go through it.

19:37.667 --> 19:41.709
Oh, peaches,
don't give it
a second thought.

19:41.709 --> 19:43.542
I understand.
I'm not new.

19:43.542 --> 19:45.458
The King won't
let us play

19:45.458 --> 19:48.041
until he shows
everybody how big
his dick is.

19:48.041 --> 19:50.083
Though, you'd think
they'd have wives

19:50.083 --> 19:51.834
and boyfriends
for that. But no.

19:51.834 --> 19:53.500
Merc's here.
We can start.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.375
All right.

19:57.917 --> 20:00.583
["Cockney" accent]
'Ello, guv'nor!
Come 'ere!

20:00.583 --> 20:03.125
Oh. Every time.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.125
So, shall I
bring in Julian?

20:07.125 --> 20:08.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.792
Everyone,
may I introduce...

20:12.792 --> 20:15.083
Julian Bullard.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.583
Welcome, Julian.
Thanks for coming in.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.000
Not at all.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.041
You know, the last time
I had to audition

20:21.041 --> 20:23.458
was...'87.

20:23.458 --> 20:26.542
It was to do Private Lives
with Dame Judi at the National,

20:26.542 --> 20:28.959
so this is
a bit of a treat.

20:28.959 --> 20:30.208
Well, we all
appreciate it.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.834
Mm. And with whom
will I be reading?

20:32.834 --> 20:35.458
Me. Career highlight.

20:35.458 --> 20:37.500
SEAN: For those
who haven't seen
this episode,

20:37.500 --> 20:40.208
in this scene,
Julian has to tell
one of the boys

20:40.208 --> 20:42.417
he's been asked
to leave St. Abban's.

20:42.417 --> 20:43.834
Oh, this is
a good one!

20:44.875 --> 20:46.041
Wow.

20:46.041 --> 20:48.041
Whenever
you're ready.

20:49.166 --> 20:51.041
Robbie...

20:51.041 --> 20:54.583
I'm afraid your time at
St. Abban's has come to an end.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.291
What? Why?

20:56.291 --> 20:59.000
Well, the teachers
and I think

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
that you would do better
at a school

21:01.000 --> 21:04.083
with a less academically
demanding curriculum.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.750
[Gentle laughter]
Why?

21:05.750 --> 21:07.583
We feel that you need

21:07.583 --> 21:11.583
a more intellectually
diminished environment.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.250
[Laughter]

21:13.250 --> 21:14.875
I don't understand.

21:14.875 --> 21:18.417
Uh, how to put this?

21:18.417 --> 21:19.917
You're not bright.

21:19.917 --> 21:21.041
[Laughter]

21:21.041 --> 21:22.208
I'm bright.

21:22.208 --> 21:24.166
No.
I'm not stupid.

21:24.166 --> 21:26.542
You are not not stupid.

21:26.542 --> 21:27.917
[Laughter]

21:27.917 --> 21:29.250
Was that too many "nots"?

21:29.250 --> 21:31.166
Maybe I'm just
not working up to
my full potential.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.792
No, this is you
firing on all cylinders.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.291
[Laughter]

21:35.291 --> 21:37.166
But all is not bleak.

21:37.166 --> 21:39.542
For you, young man,
have something

21:39.542 --> 21:42.792
far more important
than intelligence.

21:42.792 --> 21:45.000
You are...

21:45.000 --> 21:46.792
attractive.

21:46.792 --> 21:48.625
[Laughter]

21:48.625 --> 21:50.417
There isn't
a Nobel laureate

21:50.417 --> 21:52.625
that wouldn't happily
give 20 I.Q. points

21:52.625 --> 21:55.083
for those
chiseled cheekbones

21:55.083 --> 21:56.792
and that pert little bum.

21:56.792 --> 21:58.333
[Laughter]

21:58.333 --> 22:03.417
Plus, your family is rich.

22:03.417 --> 22:06.834
My God. You could be running
this whole country one day.

22:06.834 --> 22:08.333
And I assure you,

22:08.333 --> 22:10.500
intelligence would only
get in your way.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.750
[Laughter, applause]

22:18.500 --> 22:20.834
Julian, could you just
give us a minute?

22:20.834 --> 22:23.291
Certainly.
Thank you.

22:24.625 --> 22:26.250
Oh, wow.

22:26.250 --> 22:28.333
That was a treat.

22:28.333 --> 22:30.834
I gotta tell you--
he's the real deal, huh?

22:30.834 --> 22:32.917
Yes, he is.

22:32.917 --> 22:34.625
So, we're all set?

22:34.625 --> 22:36.458
Uh...

22:36.458 --> 22:38.458
hmm...

22:38.458 --> 22:40.667
Yes?
Well...

22:40.667 --> 22:42.041
is it me?

22:42.041 --> 22:44.875
Or does anybody else...

22:44.875 --> 22:47.500
feel like he comes off
a bit too English?

22:47.500 --> 22:49.875
Yeah, a little.
Yeah, yeah.

22:49.875 --> 22:52.667
Hmm. Too English.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.875
Possibly it's because...

22:54.875 --> 22:56.333
he's English?

22:56.333 --> 22:57.875
[Laughter]
Yeah!

22:57.875 --> 23:00.458
No, no. He just--

23:00.458 --> 23:03.917
He sounds, uh,
a little too...

23:03.917 --> 23:05.041
mmm, butlery.

23:05.041 --> 23:07.166
I mean,
if we're doing

23:07.166 --> 23:09.041
an American version
of the show--

23:09.041 --> 23:10.417
Yes, but he's playing
the headmaster

23:10.417 --> 23:11.875
of an elite
boarding school.

23:11.875 --> 23:13.834
The boys will be
American,

23:13.834 --> 23:15.208
the other teachers.

23:15.208 --> 23:18.041
Why can't he
be British?

23:18.041 --> 23:19.458
Oh, no, I hear you.

23:19.458 --> 23:21.709
But we need the audience
to like him.

23:21.709 --> 23:22.917
Hmm, that's true.
Oh, yeah.

23:22.917 --> 23:25.583
He has got to be
likeable, mmm.

23:27.375 --> 23:29.208
I can't believe we're
actually asking you this.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.625
Truly, I am having
an out-of-body experience.

23:31.625 --> 23:33.041
I may be sick.

23:33.041 --> 23:36.333
Julian, we'd understand
completely if you said no,

23:36.333 --> 23:38.542
but could you possibly
do the scene again

23:38.542 --> 23:40.166
in an American accent?

23:40.166 --> 23:41.542
No problem.

23:41.542 --> 23:43.125
Really?
Yeah.

23:43.125 --> 23:45.000
Oh, dear ones.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.625
I was doing
Eugene O'Neill

23:46.625 --> 23:48.792
and Tennessee Williams
before you were born.

23:48.792 --> 23:51.875
Ohh! How old are you?

23:51.875 --> 23:54.458
Piss off.
Ha ha!

23:57.125 --> 23:59.500
You all remember
Julian Bullard.

23:59.500 --> 24:02.792
Welcome back,
Mr. Bullard.

24:02.792 --> 24:05.333
Shall we do this?

24:05.333 --> 24:07.250
Um...

24:07.250 --> 24:08.750
[American accent]
Robbie.

24:08.750 --> 24:13.750
I'm afraid your time
at St. Abban's
has come to an end.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.166
What? Why?

24:15.166 --> 24:17.709
Well, the teachers and I

24:17.709 --> 24:20.125
think you would
do better at a school

24:20.125 --> 24:23.417
with a less academically
demanding curriculum.

24:23.417 --> 24:25.083
Why?

24:25.083 --> 24:29.834
Well, we feel you need
a more intellectually...

24:29.834 --> 24:32.083
diminished environment.

24:32.083 --> 24:33.542
I don't understand.

24:33.542 --> 24:36.208
How to put this?

24:36.208 --> 24:38.625
[Clears throat]
You're not bright.

24:40.792 --> 24:42.875
I'm bright.
No.

24:42.875 --> 24:44.625
I'm not stupid.

24:44.625 --> 24:47.917
You're not not stupid.

24:47.917 --> 24:50.125
I'm sorry.
Can I just go back
a little bit on that?

24:50.125 --> 24:52.083
Yeah, yeah,
absolutely.

24:52.083 --> 24:54.000
So, um--

24:54.000 --> 24:58.166
Well, how to put this?

24:58.166 --> 25:01.166
Uh, you're not bright.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.792
You're--Uhh.

25:03.792 --> 25:06.208
You're not bright.
Um...

25:06.208 --> 25:08.917
You're not bright.
You're stupid.

25:08.917 --> 25:11.333
I'm sorry. Could--

25:11.333 --> 25:13.500
Could I just try
one more thing?

25:13.500 --> 25:15.709
Absolutely. No problem.
Yeah, anything.

25:15.709 --> 25:16.834
Southern, maybe?

25:16.834 --> 25:18.834
OK. [Clears throat]
Um...

25:18.834 --> 25:22.000
Um...um...

25:22.000 --> 25:24.667
Uh, you're not bright.

25:24.667 --> 25:26.709
I'm bright.
No.

25:26.709 --> 25:28.125
I'm not stupid.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.333
You're not not stupid.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.208
That too many
"nots" there...

25:35.208 --> 25:36.709
partner?

25:38.542 --> 25:40.625
I suppose that would be

25:40.625 --> 25:43.500
if I was the headmaster
of a cowboy school.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.166
All right.

25:46.166 --> 25:49.208
I believe
we have seen enough.

25:49.208 --> 25:51.083
I know the way out.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.542
I have been here before.

25:53.542 --> 25:56.208
Thank me very much
for coming in today.

25:56.208 --> 25:59.250
And let's hope
to heaven...

25:59.250 --> 26:01.750
there's a bar
in the hotel.

26:06.375 --> 26:09.542
Is it me, or was he
just not funny?

26:14.875 --> 26:16.709
What just happened?

26:16.709 --> 26:18.959
I don't know.
And, in case
you're wondering,

26:18.959 --> 26:20.542
I'll be wanting
at least that much.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.542
Bloody pillar.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.417
All right, all right.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.208
Let's look on
the positive side.

26:32.208 --> 26:34.583
Positive side?
Well--

26:34.583 --> 26:36.083
No, just once, please,

26:36.083 --> 26:37.792
do not try and find
a positive side!

26:37.792 --> 26:40.583
Because even if you can,
which I very much doubt,

26:40.583 --> 26:43.959
my negative is so much, much
bigger than your positive.

26:43.959 --> 26:47.166
My negative openly mocks
your positive.

26:47.166 --> 26:49.375
My negative slaps
your positive around.

26:49.375 --> 26:50.875
My negative
grabs your positive,

26:50.875 --> 26:54.208
bends it over the sofa,
and buggers it from behind.

26:56.250 --> 26:58.417
My positive
did not enjoy that.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.625
[Telephone rings]

27:00.625 --> 27:02.375
[Ring]

27:03.959 --> 27:05.250
Hello?

27:05.250 --> 27:08.625
Hi, Carol.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.125
Put her on
that speaker thing.

27:10.125 --> 27:11.542
Hi, kids!

27:11.542 --> 27:12.792
Tough day.

27:12.792 --> 27:14.291
SEAN: Yep.
Yes, it was.

27:14.291 --> 27:16.834
Yeah, we all
feel terrible.

27:16.834 --> 27:19.166
Merc is sending you
a basket of
loganberries.

27:19.166 --> 27:21.291
Oh, lovely.

27:21.291 --> 27:22.792
So, how are
you two doing?

27:22.792 --> 27:24.750
Well, er--

27:24.750 --> 27:27.208
We're not
feeling positive,
I can tell you that.

27:27.208 --> 27:28.083
CAROL: I'm sure.

27:28.083 --> 27:29.625
Anyway...

27:29.625 --> 27:31.125
we should all try
and look forward.

27:31.125 --> 27:34.208
We still love
Lyman's Boys.

27:34.208 --> 27:37.083
We do!
Mm-hm.

27:37.083 --> 27:39.917
We just find it hard
to imagine doing it
without Julian.

27:39.917 --> 27:41.542
CAROL: I understand.

27:41.542 --> 27:43.125
But before we go there,

27:43.125 --> 27:45.709
we wanted to share
an idea with you.

27:45.709 --> 27:47.875
It's a different way to go,

27:47.875 --> 27:50.000
so keep your minds open.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.500
We just found out

27:51.500 --> 27:53.542
that there is
an actor available.

27:53.542 --> 27:55.500
Huge star.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.375
Hysterically funny.

27:57.375 --> 27:59.000
The audience
just loves him.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.875
And he's ready
to come back to TV.

28:00.875 --> 28:04.083
Merc thinks that he would
be perfect for this.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.834
Really? Who?

28:07.041 --> 28:09.125
Matt LeBlanc.

28:26.041 --> 28:28.625
What, you want me for
the old fat guy's part?
Thanks.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.291
We don't want you.
Again, thanks.

28:31.291 --> 28:32.417
They loved you!

28:32.417 --> 28:34.041
I don't know
that I love them.

28:34.041 --> 28:36.834
Don't let them
force you to cast
anyone you don't want.

28:37.875 --> 28:39.208
I'm totally wrong
for it, aren't I?

28:39.208 --> 28:41.083
Spectacularly wrong.

28:41.083 --> 28:43.083
We got Matt LeBlanc!

28:43.083 --> 28:44.667
What?!
