00:02.419 --> 00:03.920
Previously on Justified...

00:04.213 --> 00:06.506
- What the hell?
- I'm gonna need you to get out.

00:06.590 --> 00:09.592
If I wanted to do wrong by you,
there are things I could say.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.221
What about Ellen May?

00:13.305 --> 00:16.056
What if, in her need to unburden her soul,

00:16.600 --> 00:20.103
she decides to divulge
certain details about the murder of a pimp?

00:20.479 --> 00:21.938
Praise Jesus!

00:22.606 --> 00:23.773
Billy!

00:24.066 --> 00:25.566
Somebody call an ambulance now!

00:25.651 --> 00:27.402
Somebody please call an ambulance!

00:27.778 --> 00:29.362
Randall decided he didn't like the idea

00:29.446 --> 00:32.615
these guys had been
putting their hands on me and...

00:32.950 --> 00:34.617
Ended up beating one half to death.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.869
That's why you're
getting your stake together,

00:36.954 --> 00:39.247
get into fighter management.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.957
Get Lindsey to run the old scam,

00:41.291 --> 00:45.753
rip off some fella
does backyard fights, name of Hoppus?

00:45.963 --> 00:47.755
You get the cash. I'll make the call.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.799
So how about at 6:00 this p.m.,

00:49.925 --> 00:52.969
I put a little limp in that Gary Cooper walk,

00:53.303 --> 00:55.012
write my name
all over that pretty face of yours?

00:55.139 --> 00:56.097
How's that sound?

00:56.181 --> 00:57.682
- How much you get?
- 10.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.435
Good for you.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.186
Lindsey ain't here tonight?

01:02.354 --> 01:04.688
Last I saw her,
she was headed up to wait for you.

01:05.441 --> 01:06.774
Guess she got tired of waiting.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.866
I'm thinking you should've seen this coming.

01:14.992 --> 01:18.494
Too easy, ducking me like that.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.663
"6:00 p.m. Don't be late."

01:20.831 --> 01:23.624
So it's Randall, then...
Came back and took your money?

01:23.709 --> 01:25.168
Meaning what, everybody knows?

01:25.377 --> 01:26.961
All about your "secret money"?

01:27.504 --> 01:29.338
- Please.
- Great.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.674
How much we talking?

01:32.050 --> 01:33.885
- It was a goodly sum.
- You gonna call it in?

01:34.303 --> 01:35.636
And say what?

01:35.721 --> 01:37.180
I don't know if Lindsey's part of it

01:37.306 --> 01:40.183
or he come back, whacked her over the head,
and took her off like a caveman.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.977
- She keep stuff here?
- Like?

01:43.061 --> 01:45.480
Clothes, makeup
for whenever she stays over?

01:45.814 --> 01:48.941
Like a overnight kit, little clutch, toothbrush.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.151
And is it still here?

01:51.737 --> 01:52.862
No.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.032
Don't mean she ain't in trouble.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.701
Doesn't look like she's planning
on sleeping over much, either.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.747
How much you know about this girl?

02:04.708 --> 02:05.750
She's the bartender.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.878
Seems to know her way around a shotgun.
Got a little wild streak in her.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.006
And what do you
aim to do when you find her, exactly?

02:15.385 --> 02:16.511
What?

02:16.720 --> 02:17.887
I just

02:19.556 --> 02:21.098
kind of thought she liked me, is all.

02:24.394 --> 02:27.438
Any idea where
they might've gone with all this money?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.524
Some, maybe.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.108
Well, then,

02:31.443 --> 02:33.027
let's find out.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.089
Rufus, come on in with us.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.594
AsomBroso Reserva Tequila, right here.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.722
Some rarefied shit, $1,100 a bottle.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.140
- Missy?
- I'm good.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.393
- Randall?
- I'll take a Mountain Dew.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.436
Ho! An aristocrat.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.146
We are fresh out.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.900
Got the place feng shui'd
like three weeks ago.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.194
Hippie babe over towards Berea,

03:15.279 --> 03:18.281
the type you just want
to shave down and domesticate.

03:18.574 --> 03:22.285
Says it'll keep all the undesirable energy
out there with the animals.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.744
Y'all gonna sit or what?

03:24.121 --> 03:25.913
You just let folks tear
your house up this way?

03:26.248 --> 03:29.959
Well, you looking for work, I can always use
someone to clean up the place.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.962
Or, you know, other things.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.338
Hey, man, you're talking to my wife.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.464
No disrespect.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.174
I'm just laying out the welcome mat, is all.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.135
Pull me away

03:39.261 --> 03:41.304
from a couple honeys saying
you got business can't wait.

03:41.430 --> 03:42.847
That thing we talked about,

03:43.181 --> 03:46.434
said you got a wrecking crew just waiting on
a sugar daddy to set them up?

03:46.518 --> 03:48.144
Song remains the same, amigo.

03:48.270 --> 03:51.480
Well, we managed to lay hands
on that money a little ahead of schedule.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.442
So, what say
we do the deed right here, right now?

03:55.444 --> 03:56.652
You hear that, Rufus?

03:56.778 --> 03:58.779
Homey's gonna be a fight manager for real!

04:01.033 --> 04:02.700
- You got the cash?
- Linds?

04:07.456 --> 04:08.706
Thank you.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.428
- It's all there.
- If you don't mind, I'm thorough.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.848
Thing is, we kind of
need to accelerate the timeline here.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.099
Oh, yeah?

04:27.184 --> 04:28.309
Who'd you steal it from?

04:28.393 --> 04:30.478
You ain't gotta worry about that.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.105
All's you gotta do is
deliver what you promised.

04:33.190 --> 04:36.359
Now, now, now,
everything right now, right this minute!

04:36.485 --> 04:38.319
- There it is.
- The minuteman.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.988
That's what we ought to call you,
like your new stage name.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.199
How about it, sugar?
He the minuteman back home, too?

04:43.492 --> 04:45.743
The in-and-out quick like a bunny?
Boom, boom, boom.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.956
Now, you better be
a fast draw back there, Cinderella.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.666
I get a hold of that little-girl pistol,

04:51.750 --> 04:54.085
they be pulling it out
of your ass with forceps.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.504
Randall, you in my home, man.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.006
Why don't you sit down and act civil?

05:02.177 --> 05:03.177
What?

05:03.261 --> 05:05.638
Oh, I got your attention now? Good.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.974
'Cause I'm about to kick you
and your homeboy's ass both,

05:08.058 --> 05:09.433
take my money elsewhere.

05:09.559 --> 05:13.396
So hows about you drop the shitty attitude,
make whatever calls you need to make,

05:13.522 --> 05:15.398
and put me where I need to be?

05:17.025 --> 05:18.567
Good Lord.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.487
All you boys,
like you got dicks the size of redwoods.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.697
Lady, maybe you just better...

05:22.823 --> 05:24.407
There's $20,000 in that envelope.

05:24.866 --> 05:25.908
The question on the table is,

05:25.993 --> 05:28.244
how long do you think
it's gonna take finding it a home?

05:30.706 --> 05:31.747
I can put a call in.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.666
My boys might be
able to meet up in the morning,

05:33.750 --> 05:35.751
- take care of particulars.
- Morning when?

05:35.836 --> 05:38.337
Well, seeing as I hadn't
made a call yet, I can't really say,

05:38.422 --> 05:40.256
so why don't we
assume something like the "first thing"?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.341
How about that, honey?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.677
First thing sounds all right.

05:46.221 --> 05:50.433
Couple of hours, I'm sure we can come up
with something to do to entertain ourselves.

05:54.938 --> 05:58.024
All tense and shit, about to go off.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.235
All right, then. Let's make that phone call.

06:05.282 --> 06:09.285
See, baby?
I told you this thing is meant to be.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.037
You and me stick together,

06:11.121 --> 06:14.790
there ain't a thing in this world
that's gonna stop us.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.161
Well, I don't know what
everybody's so down in the mouth about.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.579
We are back in business.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.415
That boy would've listened to reason,
he'd still be up there preaching.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.666
I'll have a drink to that.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.089
Well, shit.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.632
Look what the cat drug in.

07:08.804 --> 07:09.845
Ellen May.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.349
You look oddly out of place
in a house of iniquity.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.017
Is Ava here?

07:15.352 --> 07:16.644
Not at the moment.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.689
You want to talk
to me about something, Ellen May?

07:21.483 --> 07:23.609
I didn't know where else to go.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.654
Well, Ellen May, you always had a home here.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.823
You chose to relinquish that, not us.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.368
You scared, Ellen May?

07:33.829 --> 07:36.831
I just keep seeing his face, all puffed up.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.960
I don't understand why
he had to die that way, is all.

07:41.044 --> 07:44.130
Arguing with a man who
has renounced his reason

07:44.214 --> 07:46.048
is like giving medicine to the dead.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.634
Billy made a choice, Ellen May.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.637
While I will not deny my
culpability in his end,

07:51.721 --> 07:53.889
the tempter bears
as much guilt as the tempted.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.642
But when it's all said and done,

07:56.726 --> 08:00.396
it was a choice
he made that led to where we are now.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.356
Ava.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.525
Ellen May.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.152
What are you doing here?

08:06.236 --> 08:08.070
Looking to win her spot back.

08:08.238 --> 08:11.240
But that decision's
gotta come from the lady of the house.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.076
You want to come back and work for me?

08:14.411 --> 08:15.494
I can work, Ava.

08:15.579 --> 08:19.165
I can start at the bottom
and take the ones nobody else wants.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.374
Yeah?

08:20.750 --> 08:22.710
How do you think
your God's gonna feel about that?

08:23.587 --> 08:24.587
I don't know.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.757
I just want to come home.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.886
Can I... Can I come...
Can I come home, please?

08:35.390 --> 08:37.099
Give us a minute.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.937
The hell is all this, you think?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.273
Well, I believe it's as simple as it looks.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.026
She ain't got no place else to go.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.944
Unless you see some other motive.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.780
I don't know.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.201
She's up there with all those Bible-thumpers
bearing witness to her trespasses.

08:55.285 --> 08:59.079
Well, that's in line with the sin
they come across in all their travels, Ava.

08:59.748 --> 09:00.873
Except Delroy.

09:01.958 --> 09:05.044
Girl looked me in the face,
talking about she knows things.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.299
I never should've
left a witness, what we done.

09:11.468 --> 09:16.138
Now either I gotta
worry about this thing or I gotta...

09:16.723 --> 09:18.307
I gotta do the other thing.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.938
I got no idea what's in her head.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.273
I'm sitting around
waiting for the other shoe to drop,

09:26.399 --> 09:27.733
wondering what she's already told,

09:27.817 --> 09:29.735
- what she's gearing up to tell...
- Hey.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.987
Let's take it one step at a time.

09:32.489 --> 09:36.325
Now, before we go too far down this road,
let me find out if she's said anything.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.077
How are you gonna do that?

09:38.161 --> 09:39.828
If she uttered a word
about Delroy in that camp,

09:39.913 --> 09:41.997
it would've filtered through
to the sister, Cassie.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.582
You know where she is?

09:45.835 --> 09:47.002
Colt?

09:48.088 --> 09:51.423
Take one of these new fish
and go find that preacher's sister.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.430
Too late to call in a hazmat team?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.015
Yeah.

10:00.183 --> 10:03.477
- I'm gonna leave this area to you.
- Thank you.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.854
What's the score, fellas?

10:06.648 --> 10:07.856
Ain't any score.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.692
You just, like, run around and kill each other.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.697
Sir? Sorry. Can I ask you...

10:18.535 --> 10:22.371
I'm looking for a guy.
Randall Kusik. Anybody?

10:22.455 --> 10:23.622
You got a picture?

10:23.707 --> 10:24.873
Not on me.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.043
Cops are looking for someone,
they usually bring a picture.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.212
He's a fighter, big guy.

10:30.547 --> 10:31.880
Man, you gotta be more specific.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.300
All them fighter fools look the same.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.885
Big hands and cauliflower ears and shit.

10:37.512 --> 10:38.721
Fighter, huh?

10:39.055 --> 10:41.557
Slim pickins come the cold light of morning.

10:41.725 --> 10:42.975
I'll bet.

10:43.893 --> 10:47.229
You know Joe Hoppus,
name on the deed of this place?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.397
I ought to.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.566
- Owes me for the fight.
- So he's here?

10:50.650 --> 10:53.527
Likely got some poor girl
bent over a sofa somewhere.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.321
But I wouldn't count on
getting much out of him.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.572
Why not?

10:56.656 --> 10:59.074
Doesn't favour blacks, hates cops.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.326
What makes you think I'm a cop?

11:01.995 --> 11:02.995
I'm not looking to make friends.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.664
I just have a couple of questions
about one of his fighters.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.250
- Yeah? Which fighter?
- Randall Kusik. You know him?

11:09.586 --> 11:10.836
Boyfriend or partner?

11:11.087 --> 11:12.588
Neither one, as such.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.759
Did I come in the middle of something?

11:16.926 --> 11:18.093
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

11:18.261 --> 11:19.386
She says Hoppus is here,

11:19.554 --> 11:21.847
but he might try and duck us.
Is that about right?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.766
- Well, Miss...
- Gina.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.769
Anything you can do to smooth the waters,
we'd greatly appreciate it.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.439
I put you about 180, maybe 185.

11:30.732 --> 11:31.940
- Am I right?
- Give or take.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.526
- Say we wrestle for it.
- We do what, now?

11:34.611 --> 11:36.028
We wrestle.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.073
I pin you, you tap out, whatever,
I'll take you both on back.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.908
You tap,

11:41.284 --> 11:43.118
well, you can leave your hat on.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.121
The thing is, Gina...

11:46.915 --> 11:49.458
I'm breaking your balls, cowboy.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.460
I don't come out of the corner for free.

11:52.128 --> 11:55.964
Come on, honey. I'll take you back.
Might as well come, too, I guess.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.062
What the hell? God damn it, Rufus!

12:10.146 --> 12:12.231
Nice socks, Joey. Gold tips?

12:12.315 --> 12:14.316
All three of you, get the hell out of here now!

12:14.442 --> 12:16.819
It's all right, Joe. You mind if I call you Joe?

12:16.903 --> 12:18.070
I just got a couple questions,

12:18.154 --> 12:20.739
so if you want to let your friends
collect themselves...

12:20.824 --> 12:22.408
They invited. You ain't.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.076
Bitches, chill.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.120
Who in the hell are you, now?

12:26.663 --> 12:28.414
I'm a deputy US Marshal,

12:28.498 --> 12:30.999
here looking for a fighter who was
on your card the other night.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.167
Randall.

12:32.335 --> 12:33.502
That's the one.

12:34.337 --> 12:37.256
He's here a few hours ago,
him and his old lady both.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.508
Blond girl, not bad looking.

12:40.343 --> 12:41.510
Gone now, though.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.845
Any idea where they went?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.430
I...

12:45.181 --> 12:46.432
Y'all got a warrant or something?

12:46.641 --> 12:47.766
What do we need a warrant for?

12:47.851 --> 12:49.184
Just asking a question.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.019
Well, suppose I ain't inclined to help?

12:51.354 --> 12:52.479
What then?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.357
State police and locals spend the day

12:55.483 --> 12:57.693
seizing and interviewing
everybody was here.

12:57.777 --> 13:02.197
And then, me being Marshal service,
there's also asset forfeiture.

13:02.699 --> 13:06.952
Now the parties won't be quite the same,
but I could use the space.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.162
I'll get my lawyer on the...

13:10.039 --> 13:11.206
Or...

13:12.375 --> 13:13.792
Since I'm only looking for Randall

13:13.877 --> 13:16.295
and I don't got eyes for you
one way or the other,

13:16.629 --> 13:19.047
we could go about this different.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.384
I'm listening.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.845
You mentioned a woman he was with?

13:26.890 --> 13:28.474
Called her Lindsey, some such.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.977
Plan was, that pretty little blonde
was gonna do her thing,

13:32.061 --> 13:36.064
get you all spun up and then have Randall
come in and twist you on a spit

13:36.191 --> 13:38.817
till they got all the money from you
they could carry.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.652
So, they done this before, then?

13:41.738 --> 13:45.240
Anyways, I'm the one
who'll put a stop to all that,

13:45.366 --> 13:47.910
making it preferable for them
to go in another direction.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.829
So I figure, since I ain't asking much,

13:50.914 --> 13:54.249
maybe my participation
earns me a simple "they went that away."

13:56.586 --> 13:58.253
You two, go on.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.506
I'm gonna talk to the Marshal.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.840
Come on.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.221
I'll tell you what.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.600
Any fool that didn't see
that grifter Barbie coming a mile off

14:11.726 --> 14:14.102
deserves getting his ass fleeced.

14:16.773 --> 14:17.856
I don't know the game much,

14:17.941 --> 14:20.943
outside once I saw
Sugar Ray Leonard put Roberto Duran down

14:21.027 --> 14:24.196
with a bolo punch when I was a kid.
That was something.

14:24.572 --> 14:28.575
But I hear Randall wants
to get into fighter management.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.787
You got any kind of line
on what that looks like?

14:38.628 --> 14:42.047
So, saying these fighters
Randall's looking to manage are what...

14:42.131 --> 14:43.465
- Chickens?
- Gamecocks.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.758
Gamecocks.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.970
Said he wanted to manage fighters.
I figured he meant, you know...

14:48.096 --> 14:51.056
- How much money did you say it was, again?
- I didn't.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.058
So how do you know
that fool in there hadn't got it,

14:53.142 --> 14:55.727
- sending us off on a wild-goose chase?
- I don't.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.396
But I don't see him going anywhere.

14:57.480 --> 15:01.066
And if he's straight, I got less than two hours
to get clear out to Versailles,

15:01.150 --> 15:04.069
find this chicken guy,
keep whatever deal they got from

15:04.153 --> 15:05.237
"taking flight."

15:05.321 --> 15:06.655
Saying you got. What about me?

15:06.990 --> 15:09.157
Oh, I thought you might want to stay
and talk to your new friend.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.951
Oh, so now you're funny.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.745
Two hours before I have to be at the office.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.290
You want to see some cockfighting?

15:16.833 --> 15:18.917
You gonna tell me
how much money it was or not?

15:19.002 --> 15:20.085
I did.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.795
It's a goodly sum.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.340
Did you mean the Fuji or the Kodak?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.301
Well, which one did you say
is better for greens?

15:27.594 --> 15:28.844
The Fuji. My opinion.

15:29.304 --> 15:30.345
I'll go with your opinion.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.267
Hey, man. You got beer in a bottle?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.810
Yeah. Back of the store, chief.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.104
My sister keeps saying
I ought to switch to digital,

15:39.188 --> 15:41.189
but then I got to get a computer and all.

15:41.316 --> 15:42.441
Oh, I hear that.

15:42.650 --> 15:46.361
Now, did you want the 400 or the 200?

15:46.821 --> 15:48.196
I don't really understand the numbers.

15:48.698 --> 15:49.948
Oh, it's the ASA.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.326
The higher the number,
the darker you can shoot.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.535
Oh, Lord.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.454
Can I see both?

15:57.832 --> 16:01.043
You sure know a lot about this stuff.
I'd be so lost.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.879
Well, I'm kind of a shutterbug myself.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.214
- Really?
- Yeah, it's just a hobby.

16:06.341 --> 16:09.301
You know, art stuff, mostly...

16:09.886 --> 16:13.180
Landscapes and figure studies...

16:14.974 --> 16:18.393
Tasteful boudoir shots and such.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.480
Well.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.565
Okay, then.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.654
I don't know which one to pick.
Can I see that one over there?

16:28.738 --> 16:32.032
- The 800?
- Yeah, that one over there. Thanks.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.535
"Boudoir," he says.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.747
Like I'm gonna freak out
if he calls them "titty pictures."

16:40.208 --> 16:42.584
Look at you, all high on yourself.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.587
Now, you can't tell me you
hadn't missed this, girl.

16:45.713 --> 16:46.922
Well...

16:48.424 --> 16:51.093
All I've ever wanted to do
is manage fighters.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.928
- This is it.
- This is it.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.265
What I got planned, that little stack
we took off your Marshal friend,

16:57.350 --> 16:58.684
that's gonna look like chicken feed.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.061
Them little white hackles are killers.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.689
We set them up with some
Ronnie Callaway gaffs,

17:03.773 --> 17:06.108
they will tear any other breed to tatters.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.361
Boone says they're
like the Bruce Lee of fighting chickens.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.075
What?

17:16.786 --> 17:18.537
Start talking about Bruce Lee,

17:19.122 --> 17:20.789
get me feeling a little something.

17:21.624 --> 17:24.291
Thinking maybe I ought
to pull you over this seat,

17:24.460 --> 17:26.795
we celebrate something proper.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.803
What?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.432
- You kind of liked it, though, didn't you?
- Liked what?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.726
Talking "titty pictures," "ASA."

17:40.810 --> 17:42.060
Don't start.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.438
We got a little bubbly. No harm done.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.314
Yeah.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.899
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.902
Let's keep our eyes
on the prize here, okay, baby?

17:50.987 --> 17:52.154
Okay.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.326
- Randall.
- It ain't gonna take but a minute.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.828
- Randall, no!
- Hush, now.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.164
You buckle up for safety.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.853
Miss Cassie. Thank you for coming in.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.189
Not like I had much choice.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.857
Oh, I apologise for that.

18:28.941 --> 18:33.695
I've had deputies out trying to find you
since I heard what befell your brother.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.030
Why is that, Sheriff?

18:35.156 --> 18:38.992
I don't aim to frighten you,
but I think you ought to know

18:39.160 --> 18:42.954
Boyd Crowder's got people of his own
out after finding you.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.373
He hadn't done enough already?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.375
Something else he's looking to steal away?

18:47.627 --> 18:50.462
I imagine he's interested in what you know,

18:50.546 --> 18:53.465
things could hurt him,
his criminal enterprises.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.384
Kind of like how he killed my brother?

18:56.677 --> 18:57.844
That's public knowledge, Sheriff.

18:58.888 --> 19:03.225
Well, your brother's death,
while tragic and untimely,

19:03.309 --> 19:06.812
was not, on the face of it,
actionable as a crime.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.480
So, what, then?

19:08.731 --> 19:13.026
Boyd Crowder is unfettered by conscience,

19:13.569 --> 19:18.406
absent any moral compass
that you and me might reckon by.

19:19.408 --> 19:23.578
Thinks he has reason to,
he will kill you quick as look at you twice.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.749
What is it he thinks I know?

19:27.834 --> 19:33.588
Well, oftentimes,
along the path to salvation, folks testify,

19:34.423 --> 19:37.759
things they seen, things they may be done.

19:38.094 --> 19:41.429
If anyone ever said anything
Boyd thinks you could use against him,

19:41.597 --> 19:43.557
he will not leave that end untied.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.684
Good.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.602
He is right to be scared. I do know things.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.437
Well...

19:50.773 --> 19:53.525
Anything I can pick him up for, start a case?

19:53.609 --> 19:55.527
Yeah, whoremongering drug pusher.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.738
Trying to bribe me
to move my church elsewhere.

19:59.282 --> 20:01.616
And that's after
he sent thugs out to scare us.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.035
Well, the question is, is there anything else,

20:04.453 --> 20:05.620
anything I don't know?

20:06.247 --> 20:09.624
If that ain't enough, Sheriff,
then there's nothing.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.879
He'll have his reckoning someday.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.882
Just like you will, just like I will.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.091
And that's enough for you?

20:18.801 --> 20:20.802
The wrathful judgment of Almighty God?

20:22.471 --> 20:24.514
Sheriff, that ought to be enough for anybody.

20:26.517 --> 20:27.601
Ned!

20:30.313 --> 20:31.771
I wish you all the best, ma'am.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.150
May God be with you.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.283
- Did you get all that?
- Well played, Shelby.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.035
And you're satisfied now?

20:45.119 --> 20:46.328
It'll do.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.204
Though I must say, it gives me pause,

20:48.289 --> 20:50.457
hearing you run my character down
in such wanton...

20:51.167 --> 20:52.208
Hello?

20:53.210 --> 20:54.878
I believe he hung up on me.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.631
You feel better?

20:58.215 --> 20:59.925
- I do.
- But...

21:01.260 --> 21:03.762
Boyd, I mean,

21:04.221 --> 21:06.222
I got an investment in the girl.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.141
I shed blood keeping her safe.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.394
But even loyal, she's wild.

21:12.313 --> 21:15.565
Firing off shots at her clients
and huffing down oxy.

21:15.650 --> 21:16.733
God knows what else.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.568
Not to mention, she's been off

21:18.653 --> 21:21.196
sobbing in the corner
the whole night she's been back.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.615
I just...

21:25.034 --> 21:26.868
Well, there might be another way, yet.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.204
I'm listening.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.540
You remember my cousin Lonnie?

21:32.917 --> 21:34.334
Over in Alabama?

21:34.752 --> 21:35.919
Yeah, he got but the one leg.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.296
He came that time to Sunday dinner at Bo's?

21:38.381 --> 21:41.841
He got drunk, flipped his old Plymouth
right in front of the house.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.134
I remember.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.804
Well, he sobered up after that, found Jesus.

21:46.430 --> 21:50.725
Runs a little no-tell motel,
kind with the free HBO but no ice.

21:50.893 --> 21:53.269
Has a little lay congregation out back.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.357
Ellen May wants to be done whoring,
he might give her a chance at honest work,

21:57.441 --> 21:59.192
cleaning rooms and whatnot.

21:59.610 --> 22:00.860
If she doesn't like what he's preaching,

22:00.945 --> 22:03.738
there's plenty of other churches
in Boiling Springs.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.448
Whorehouses, too.

22:07.618 --> 22:09.995
You think he'll take her in,
all her crazy bullshit?

22:10.955 --> 22:12.914
Well, I think he might welcome the challenge.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.215
Damn it.

22:26.679 --> 22:27.762
What the hell?

22:28.305 --> 22:31.224
Randall, what did I just say?
Damn it, Randall! Stop!

22:31.308 --> 22:32.809
Just keep it running.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.813
Hey, asshole...

22:48.242 --> 22:50.285
Hey, it's me. Listen, I just...

22:52.329 --> 22:53.621
God damn it, Randall.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.665
Who's that? Who you calling?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.917
- Calling 911.
- You did what?

22:58.002 --> 23:01.713
So that boy inside doesn't die
waiting for help, idiot.

23:01.922 --> 23:05.717
Now, if it's all out of your system,
then can we go before they get here?

23:06.177 --> 23:07.343
God damn it!

23:10.681 --> 23:14.517
That's my big boy, right there,
Nimrod, like in the Old Testament.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.853
- You fight him?
- No, not any more.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.104
He has health problems.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.024
Looking at me
like he wants to peck my eyeballs out.

23:21.358 --> 23:24.402
He's a sweetheart,
unless you push him too far.

23:24.612 --> 23:27.614
Lose his temper, though, watch out.
He'll cut you like a prison bitch.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.450
Little chicken toenails do all that damage?

23:30.618 --> 23:31.826
Toenails, hell.

23:32.036 --> 23:33.578
You see these gaffs here?

23:34.246 --> 23:35.663
Keep them sharp as a diamond.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.290
They get them buried up in
one another up in the pen,

23:37.374 --> 23:39.626
we got to reach in
and pull the birds apart again.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.170
You be careful, though. You get caught here,

23:42.630 --> 23:44.798
here, or here,

23:44.882 --> 23:47.175
it's "lights out," sister.
No lullaby. Good night.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.428
Mr Gaines, you keep
putting that little blade close to my face,

23:50.513 --> 23:53.556
I'm gonna take it away from you
and see who's singing who a lullaby.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.392
Lady don't blink.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.311
She's all right.

23:58.395 --> 23:59.479
Two more questions, then,

23:59.563 --> 24:02.148
- about Randall Kusik.
- Never met the man.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.568
I try to insulate myself from direct contact
with the end buyer.

24:05.653 --> 24:08.321
So, Boone brothers
collect payment from Randall.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.990
They pay you. You assemble the whatever?

24:11.075 --> 24:12.659
Kentucky gold deluxe fight package,

24:12.743 --> 24:15.245
everything you need
to dominate the royal sport of cockfighting

24:15.329 --> 24:17.914
in an easy-to-transport premium motor rig.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.083
- Blades come in the package?
- Gaffs, Miss.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.044
Jesus!

24:23.420 --> 24:25.046
Rachel.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.513
- She called me.
- She called you?

24:33.597 --> 24:36.766
I didn't recognise her number at first,
so I sent it to voicemail.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.768
Reverse lookup now. Not her cell.

24:38.853 --> 24:40.103
Well, what'd she say?

24:40.396 --> 24:42.438
I don't know why he come in on me like that.

24:43.023 --> 24:46.860
All I'd done was show his lady
what kind of film to buy.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.194
You saw him before this?

24:48.279 --> 24:51.656
It's on the video there,
two of them come in here before.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.367
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear that blond girl

24:54.451 --> 24:55.910
set me up to take a beating.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.871
I know what you mean.

24:57.955 --> 25:00.582
Guess I should have known
it was too good to be true.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.960
I don't meet many people
with a common interest.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.755
I just thought...

25:09.633 --> 25:10.884
I don't know.

25:11.302 --> 25:12.468
Yeah.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.805
Either one of them mention
where they were headed any point in all this?

25:16.265 --> 25:19.851
Said she wanted to shoot pictures of horses
at some farm across the way.

25:21.896 --> 25:24.480
I told her to use the Fuji stock.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.233
It gets better greens.

25:27.318 --> 25:28.985
She happen to say which farm?

25:29.987 --> 25:31.946
What am I supposed to do in Alabama?

25:32.031 --> 25:35.116
Boyd's got kin there, decent people,
and that's what you're after.

25:35.451 --> 25:38.161
You can work his motel
till you get back on your feet and figure out

25:38.287 --> 25:39.746
what's next when you're ready.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.122
But I don't want to go.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.124
Ava, please, don't send me away.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.293
I will work harder here.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.503
Ellen May, you don't want to be here.

25:47.630 --> 25:50.048
You've been looking for a way out
as long as I've known you.

25:50.424 --> 25:52.258
I'm saying, darlin', this is your way out.

25:52.676 --> 25:56.012
Ava, this is my home.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.056
I grew up here.

25:58.766 --> 26:00.391
I always thought that maybe,

26:00.476 --> 26:03.811
maybe I'd meet the right boy,
get a little house.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.398
- I ain't much for babies, but if he wanted...
- Honey.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.984
You're getting the chance I never got,

26:10.319 --> 26:11.527
you get to start over.

26:12.029 --> 26:15.323
But I don't want to start over.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.786
There's $1,000 in this envelope.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.621
Take it.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.585
Make something out of yourself
worth being proud of.

26:28.128 --> 26:31.673
Tell it all to Whoopi Goldberg one
day on The View, right?

26:31.799 --> 26:33.758
Your rise from humble beginnings.

26:35.719 --> 26:40.723
It just feels like I'm being sent off,
and I don't know why.

26:42.226 --> 26:45.311
Well, look at it for what it is, you're free.

26:49.817 --> 26:52.777
Next time, you give a blowjob
because you want to.

26:53.570 --> 26:54.988
If you even want to.

26:55.322 --> 26:58.491
No more being afraid
or getting kicked around.

27:02.246 --> 27:04.998
It ain't never gonna be
that way around here for you.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.836
Colt's gonna give you
a ride to the bus station

27:09.920 --> 27:12.213
- when you get yourself together.
- Okay.

27:17.011 --> 27:20.805
Tamahill Farms is just up Route 62
in case we get separated.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.725
But it's time to go to work.

27:24.727 --> 27:27.228
- I can call in sick.
- You ain't gonna call in sick.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.439
- Come this far.
- Far enough.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.692
Next bit, I don't know.
But one Marshal out over, it's enough.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.402
Give Art a stroke, us both in the wind.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.449
Got a little present for you.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.827
Maybe even up the odds a little bit.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.424
Counting on you knowing how to use that.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.843
I'll do my level best.

28:12.066 --> 28:15.318
- You ready to roll?
- Well, hell.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.369
Well, what the hell, Lindsey?

28:24.453 --> 28:26.829
He's a Marshal, Randall. It's what they do.

28:30.501 --> 28:31.584
Shit.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.380
Well, let's go.

28:45.766 --> 28:47.225
That's close enough.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.644
Come alone, from the looks of it.

28:49.728 --> 28:50.812
That's something.

28:51.188 --> 28:52.355
I did.

28:52.523 --> 28:54.524
Just you and your shotgun.

28:55.192 --> 28:56.734
I, for the record, am unarmed.

28:57.945 --> 29:00.029
There ain't any record, Randall.

29:00.114 --> 29:01.447
Not today.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.199
Lindsey.

29:03.700 --> 29:04.951
Raylan.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.869
Feel like I missed a step
along the way somewhere.

29:07.329 --> 29:08.579
How's that song go?

29:08.705 --> 29:10.373
"Look for the rainbow in every storm"?

29:11.208 --> 29:12.625
I'll have to download that.

29:12.709 --> 29:13.793
How'd you find us?

29:14.002 --> 29:16.421
She didn't tell you about
her little phone call?

29:16.630 --> 29:18.214
You said you dialled 911.

29:19.383 --> 29:22.135
She must've dialled wrong,
'cause my phone rang.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.178
That was quite a number
you did on poor Alvin.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.889
He didn't even sleep with my wife.
Think how you're gonna look.

29:26.974 --> 29:30.226
That your thing, Randall? Your weak spot?

29:30.477 --> 29:33.479
You want her spinning up the boys,
keep 'em pixilated,

29:33.564 --> 29:34.814
like Longfellow Deeds,

29:34.898 --> 29:39.152
but you just can't stand the thought
that she might enjoy it, too.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.821
Got to take something back, feel like a man.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.990
You're forgetting the part
where she gets off on it,

29:44.074 --> 29:45.283
me batting cleanup.

29:45.367 --> 29:47.535
Or did you fail to notice who she's here with?

29:47.953 --> 29:49.162
No.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.331
I wondered about that.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.251
Wondering, why did you call me?

29:55.794 --> 30:00.590
Hoping I'd ride up, rescue you from all this,
tell me how he put you up to it?

30:00.674 --> 30:04.594
Or just 'cause it'd be fun
watching us tear one another up?

30:05.679 --> 30:06.971
Hurts, don't it?

30:07.431 --> 30:09.891
They're beanbag rounds.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.893
Not my thing, ordinarily.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.854
An associate of mine thought nonlethal
force might come in handy.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.148
I figure, "What the hell? I'll give it a shot."

30:17.608 --> 30:19.108
You know, girl walks out on me,

30:19.193 --> 30:22.445
usually I can count on,
like, a letter or something.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.780
I was never much of a hand at it.

30:24.865 --> 30:28.117
Prefer a clean break,
like ripping off a Band-Aid?

30:29.578 --> 30:30.995
Suppose you're gonna ask me why.

30:31.580 --> 30:32.830
Doesn't matter.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.542
- Well, you oughta know I never meant to...
- You know what?

30:36.668 --> 30:38.002
Let's not do that.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.755
So, what now?

30:41.256 --> 30:43.966
What now is, where's my money?

30:49.556 --> 30:51.307
That hurts, don't it?

30:52.100 --> 30:54.143
More than any pussy-ass beanbag gun.

30:57.147 --> 31:00.274
Just take that.
You're going to a dark place, Marshal.

31:00.651 --> 31:03.069
I want my face to be the last thing you see.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.703
Come on!

31:12.788 --> 31:14.205
You always talk this much when you fight?

31:14.289 --> 31:18.000
Oh, honey, this ain't a fight,
it's an execution.

31:24.466 --> 31:25.591
Hey!

31:29.263 --> 31:30.638
Lindsey...

31:35.269 --> 31:36.352
That's my girl!

31:37.688 --> 31:39.146
Shit!

31:39.523 --> 31:40.898
Here, baby. Give me this thing.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.251
Hey.

32:01.712 --> 32:05.006
You want your money,
it's all right in that van up there.

32:09.511 --> 32:10.761
What?

32:13.056 --> 32:14.890
I knew you liked me.

32:31.325 --> 32:32.992
Jesus, man.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.952
How many times did she shoot me?

32:35.037 --> 32:37.121
Couple more times than she shot me.

32:37.247 --> 32:39.582
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

32:39.750 --> 32:40.916
Took your car, looks like.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.419
Aren't you gonna chase her down
or something?

32:43.503 --> 32:44.587
Nah, I don't think so.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.505
Well, what are you gonna do?

32:46.923 --> 32:50.468
Put a call in to the state police,
have them drive over,

32:50.552 --> 32:54.513
escort you down to face warrants
you got out of Duval County, Florida.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.432
You're just gonna leave me here?

32:56.683 --> 32:58.267
You got a better idea?

32:58.894 --> 33:00.811
Well, suppose they're a long time coming.

33:02.272 --> 33:03.522
You wait.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.534
"Money's in the van," she says.

33:16.078 --> 33:17.495
Oh, them chickens.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.040
You got to understand, man,

33:21.124 --> 33:23.417
I've been holding that dream
in my head so long,

33:23.502 --> 33:26.629
I might kind of lost sight of the thing.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.756
Randall, I know you're shackled,
and it ain't half fair,

33:28.840 --> 33:31.884
but you say one more word about chickens,
I'm gonna shoot you again.

33:37.641 --> 33:40.017
End of the day, when it's all done,

33:41.103 --> 33:43.312
she's still kind of worth it, though, isn't she?

33:45.816 --> 33:48.234
Tell the trooper I said, "Sorry for the mess."

33:53.990 --> 33:57.243
There's money in fighting chickens, Raylan.
You think about it.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.455
Oh, you...

34:06.336 --> 34:09.255
We're low on Stoli and Cuervo,
so maybe you could stretch it out,

34:09.339 --> 34:11.841
make it last till I can make a call?

34:12.967 --> 34:14.635
- You all set, then?
- I am.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.429
- All right, well...
- I know why you're sending me away, Ava.

34:17.514 --> 34:18.597
- I been thinking about it...
- Ellen May...

34:18.681 --> 34:21.225
You got to know,
I would never say nothing about what we...

34:21.309 --> 34:22.768
God damn it!

34:23.228 --> 34:26.105
Ellen May, what the hell is wrong with you?

34:26.188 --> 34:29.608
I'm just saying, if that's the reason,

34:29.860 --> 34:32.319
killing Delroy, I can keep my mouth shut.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.155
You'll see.

34:34.531 --> 34:37.408
I'm just...
I'm just trying to say that I won't, I won't...

34:37.492 --> 34:39.243
I know you won't say anything, Ellen May.

34:39.828 --> 34:43.246
I know it. It's all right.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.835
You better go now. Colt's waiting.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.340
Goodbye, I guess.

34:54.885 --> 34:56.010
Goodbye, Ellen May.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.706
Beanbag rounds were a nice touch.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.458
What are you gonna do about the chickens?

35:27.584 --> 35:29.627
I'm driving around
looking for a barbecue joint

35:29.711 --> 35:30.878
to drop them off at.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.087
Don't even joke.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.924
However it went down, they're all yours now.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.133
Don't worry.

35:36.218 --> 35:39.428
Sure by now they've been fed,
watered, watching cartoons.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.097
What about the money?

35:42.557 --> 35:46.393
Figure may be the universe's way of saying
I wasn't meant to have it in the first place.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.395
What about Lindsey?

35:48.772 --> 35:51.232
- What about her?
- You let her go?

35:51.817 --> 35:53.609
Kind of the same answer as the money.

35:54.653 --> 35:55.778
What are you gonna do now?

36:42.951 --> 36:44.118
Hey.

36:47.289 --> 36:48.455
You sure?

36:52.377 --> 36:57.464
All right.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.387
Who was that?

37:06.641 --> 37:07.850
That was Ava.

37:08.685 --> 37:09.810
What'd she say?

37:10.645 --> 37:11.979
She said,

37:12.814 --> 37:14.982
that if you're ready to come back to work,

37:15.692 --> 37:17.234
I mean really work,

37:18.153 --> 37:20.029
then there's a place for you at Audrey's.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.032
I can work!

37:23.658 --> 37:25.784
I can work! I will! You'll see!

37:25.869 --> 37:27.661
Okay. We'll see.

37:28.163 --> 37:29.204
She say why?

37:30.749 --> 37:31.999
No, she did not.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.380
I bet it's 'cause of what I told her.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.217
Probably.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.186
Feels good.

37:54.064 --> 37:55.522
Going home.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.250
It'll be quick, Ava.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.587
She'll never know.

38:19.381 --> 38:20.923
She won't be afraid.

38:22.759 --> 38:25.427
One minute, she's here,
and the next, she's gone.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.222
Just like that.

38:40.610 --> 38:43.570
I got to take a piss. You pump, I'll pay.

38:43.905 --> 38:45.614
- Put in $10.
- Okay.

39:36.458 --> 39:37.791
Just a minute!

40:07.864 --> 40:09.364
Oh, shit.

40:09.949 --> 40:11.200
Oh, shit!

40:12.035 --> 40:13.994
Shit! Shit!

40:20.543 --> 40:22.628
Hey! Did you see a girl?

40:26.633 --> 40:27.925
Oh, come on.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.348
Shit!

40:35.850 --> 40:37.184
Oh, Ellen May.
