08:29.009 --> 08:30.427
- 'Mm-hmm.'

08:30.469 --> 08:31.928
Why?

08:31.970 --> 08:34.555
Well, I just wanted

08:31.970 --> 08:34.555
to make sure we're buddies.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.932
We cool now?

08:35.974 --> 08:39.560
- Yeah, I guess.

08:35.974 --> 08:39.560
- Alright. This is great.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.604
Thanks for the skins, bud.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.526
Okay...give

08:44.565 --> 08:46.526
them a try, Deej.

08:46.567 --> 08:47.568
Okay.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.697
[off tune drumbeats]

08:53.616 --> 08:55.369
How am I doing?

08:55.410 --> 08:58.413
Well, you're facing

08:55.410 --> 08:58.413
the right direction.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.832
Let me show you. I played

08:58.455 --> 09:00.832
a little in junior high school.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.501
See if I remember anything.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.793
Well, see, what you do is

09:03.835 --> 09:06.213
you start off with

09:03.835 --> 09:06.213
the bass drum like this.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.382
Then you add the snare.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.591
Then you add the high-hat.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.594
And before long,

09:12.093 --> 09:13.594
you get this.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.723
[drumbeats]

09:25.857 --> 09:27.901
[cheering]

09:27.942 --> 09:30.320
Hey, what a welcome.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.531
Look, we got drums.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.366
No,<i> we</i> got drums.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.285
No,<i> I</i> got drums.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.828
Come on, Joey,

09:37.327 --> 09:38.828
we better get to Tahoe.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.831
Better hurry up.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.831
The fog is really getting thick.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.250
How thick is it?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.626
Well, I don't wanna say

09:43.291 --> 09:45.626
it's as thick as pea soup

09:45.668 --> 09:47.754
but people are throwing

09:45.668 --> 09:47.754
croutons out their windows.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.256
[drumbeats]

09:50.798 --> 09:52.759
And, now let's have

09:50.798 --> 09:52.759
a big round of applause

09:52.800 --> 09:54.635
for the Harry Levin Trio.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.764
Oh, thank you. You're a nutty

09:54.677 --> 09:57.764
guy. Thanks very much.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.224
Thank you, boys.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.102
Don't forget to turn off

09:59.266 --> 10:02.102
the bubble machine.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.937
Bye.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.689
- How you doing, pop?

10:03.978 --> 10:06.689
- Hey.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.401
- Hey, Jess. Looking good.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.401
- You too.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.445
(both)

10:09.443 --> 10:11.445
Thanks.

10:11.486 --> 10:14.531
- How's it going, daddy-O?

10:11.486 --> 10:14.531
- Everything is great.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.578
I thought I'd

10:16.950 --> 10:19.578
find you here.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.997
Girls, your grandpa's

10:19.619 --> 10:22.997
moving in...forever.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.000
Give grandma a hug.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.169
- Hi, grandma.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.169
- Grandma.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.546
What'd you do this time?

10:29.588 --> 10:30.838
Well, I simply suggested

10:30.880 --> 10:32.715
that she spend

10:30.880 --> 10:32.715
a little less time

10:32.757 --> 10:34.759
at night school

10:32.757 --> 10:34.759
and concentrate on her

10:34.801 --> 10:36.470
domestic responsibilities.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.639
His exact words were,

10:36.511 --> 10:39.639
"Yo, Irene

10:39.680 --> 10:42.517
drop outta that flaky college,

10:39.680 --> 10:42.517
come home and make me dinner."

10:42.559 --> 10:43.893
I don't talk like that.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.312
- First place--

10:43.935 --> 10:45.312
- 'That's just what you--'

10:45.353 --> 10:48.064
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

10:45.353 --> 10:48.064
There's kids in the room.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.942
D.J., I didn't know

10:48.106 --> 10:50.942
you could play the drums.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.527
I can't. Listen.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.655
[off tune drumbeats]

11:00.743 --> 11:04.038
Oh, no. That racket

11:00.743 --> 11:04.038
is coming from my house.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.750
Dad, Uncle Jesse

11:05.248 --> 11:07.750
bought me these drums.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.170
Oh, did he really?

11:10.211 --> 11:12.464
Oh, good old Uncle J.

11:12.506 --> 11:13.756
- Uncle J.

11:12.506 --> 11:13.756
- Hmm?

11:13.798 --> 11:16.593
Could I see you in the K?

11:13.798 --> 11:16.593
Right away?

11:18.094 --> 11:20.180
Why, yes, you may.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.892
When can I have a turn?

11:24.934 --> 11:27.020
Right after I get good at this.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.980
So I guess

11:27.061 --> 11:28.980
the answer is never.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.192
Drums?

11:32.233 --> 11:34.027
Did I do something to you?

11:34.068 --> 11:37.447
Come on, Danny, every kid in

11:34.068 --> 11:37.447
America wants a set of drums.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.533
Good. Then we'll have

11:37.489 --> 11:39.533
no trouble selling them.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.117
[drumbeats]

11:41.159 --> 11:43.495
Will you please

11:41.159 --> 11:43.495
stop that drumming?

11:43.537 --> 11:44.996
Oh, sorry.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.961
What possessed you

11:49.708 --> 11:51.961
to buy her drums?

11:52.003 --> 11:54.673
Well, I felt bad about yelling

11:52.003 --> 11:54.673
at her, so I thought I'd buy her

11:54.713 --> 11:56.841
something to, you know,

11:54.713 --> 11:56.841
kind of make things better.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.802
That's how you

11:57.884 --> 11:59.802
solve problems?

11:59.844 --> 12:02.389
- You buy the kid off?

11:59.844 --> 12:02.389
- It worked.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.225
She loves the drums. She loves

12:02.430 --> 12:05.225
me. What's your problem?

12:05.266 --> 12:08.645
My problem is,

12:05.266 --> 12:08.645
instead of talking to D.J.

12:08.687 --> 12:12.482
you went out and bought her

12:08.687 --> 12:12.482
the world's most obnoxious gift.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.611
Well, a thousand apologies

12:14.025 --> 12:16.611
for bringing the joy of music

12:16.653 --> 12:18.613
into a young girl's life.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.989
- Jesse--

12:18.655 --> 12:19.989
- No, don't worry.

12:20.031 --> 12:21.282
I'll handle this.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.036
Deej...I got bad news.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.121
Your dad doesn't want

12:25.078 --> 12:27.121
you to have the drums.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.875
But, dad, they're a present from

12:27.163 --> 12:30.875
Uncle Jesse. That's not fair.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.294
Thanks, Jess.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.133
should let them work it out.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.886
Now that I live here,

12:39.175 --> 12:41.886
I should be involved.

You live here now?

Nick will tell

12:47.975 --> 12:50.103
you all about it.

Then you can

12:50.144 --> 12:51.854
call me at home

12:51.896 --> 12:53.981
and I'll tell you

12:51.896 --> 12:53.981
what really happened.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.537
- Did I call it?

13:07.579 --> 13:11.165
I am back because the fog is so

13:07.579 --> 13:11.165
thick I couldn't see the steps.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.960
Looks like you're

13:39.778 --> 13:42.614
about my drums yet?

13:42.656 --> 13:44.616
No, honey. I wanna sleep on it.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.867

Goodnight, grandpa.

14:02.759 --> 14:03.842
Goodnight.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.053
I'll be, uh, sleeping

in Joey's room

14:06.095 --> 14:09.974
to beg for forgiveness.

- Night. Goodnight, kids.

- Goodnight, grandma.

- Goodnight.

- Goodnight, grandpa.

- Goodnight. Goodnight.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.187
- Goodnight.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.355
Goodnight.

Okay, everybody in bed.

Dad, how come

14:19.025 --> 14:21.695
everybody's mad tonight?

14:21.736 --> 14:23.863
Maybe it's because

14:21.736 --> 14:23.863
Kimmy Gibbler's here.

14:25.782 --> 14:26.949
I don't think so.

Hi.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.428
Just came in

14:45.468 --> 14:47.428
to check on Michelle.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.096
Don't worry.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.096
I didn't buy her a thing.

So, Michelle,

14:50.139 --> 14:53.560
where were we?

Oh, yes, so the nice,

handsome prince with great hair

14:58.189 --> 15:02.902
gave the young princess

14:58.189 --> 15:02.902
a magical, musical gift.

15:02.943 --> 15:06.906
Just then, the tall, geeky giant

15:02.943 --> 15:06.906
came in and took the gift away.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.786
The princess was so sad.

15:11.828 --> 15:14.330
And that, Michelle,

15:11.828 --> 15:14.330
was the day the music died.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.250
Give me my kid.

Geeky giant.

Geeky giant.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.009
Yeah, Michelle, that

15:25.049 --> 15:27.009
was my favorite part too.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.177
Give me a kiss.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.472
[Jesse laughing]

15:33.224 --> 15:35.727
Let me tell you the real story.

15:35.769 --> 15:41.649
Once upon a time, the tall

15:35.769 --> 15:41.649
and lean and elegant prince

15:41.691 --> 15:45.236
from the Land of Wisdom

15:41.691 --> 15:45.236
came to save the princess

15:45.278 --> 15:46.654
from the hotheaded troubadour

15:46.696 --> 15:48.865
who spent way too

15:46.696 --> 15:48.865
much time on his hair.

Geeky giant.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.706
[instrumental music]

16:00.460 --> 16:02.545
[snoring]

16:14.223 --> 16:15.516
Does she snore that loud

16:15.558 --> 16:17.977
'cause she has all

16:15.558 --> 16:17.977
that air in her head?

16:20.062 --> 16:21.063
This is so weird.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.189
She never snores when

16:22.231 --> 16:23.650
she's sleeping in class.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.570
Let's get her out of here.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.824
Come on, Kimmy. Get up.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.869

Come on. Come on.

I pity the fool

16:39.039 --> 16:41.292
who marries this woman.

16:42.877 --> 16:46.798
- Let's go, Kimmy. Come on.

16:42.877 --> 16:46.798
- 'Come on, Kimmy, come on.'

made it out of town.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.515
Yeah, me too.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.266
At least that fog

17:37.557 --> 17:39.266
cleared up a little.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.978
Or we'd still be driving

17:39.308 --> 17:41.978
around that Kmart parking lot.

17:45.105 --> 17:46.858
- Goodnight.

17:45.105 --> 17:46.858
- Night.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.443

19:12.485 --> 19:14.904

19:14.946 --> 19:16.572
What's wrong

19:14.946 --> 19:16.572
with his wife?

19:16.614 --> 19:18.992
Nothing. You're a very

19:16.614 --> 19:18.992
attractive woman.

19:19.033 --> 19:21.160
Hey, back off, man. That's

19:19.033 --> 19:21.160
my mommy you're talkin' about.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.705
- Sorry.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.705
- Here, put a robe on.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.458
Nobody wants to see this.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.794
Nick, your wife

19:27.500 --> 19:29.794
shouldn't be sleeping alone.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.587
She loves to cuddle.

Alright, now that

19:35.133 --> 19:36.884
you're both awake

19:38.761 --> 19:42.473
Hey, alright,

19:38.761 --> 19:42.473
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.184
First thing in the morning,

19:42.515 --> 19:45.184
we'll go to that shop you like

19:45.225 --> 19:47.061
buy you a brand-new outfit.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.396
Nick, you can't just

19:47.103 --> 19:49.396
buy me a new outfit

19:49.438 --> 19:51.607
and expect everything

19:49.438 --> 19:51.607
to be all better.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.360
You're right.

19:54.401 --> 19:57.780
- I'll throw in a pair of shoes.

19:54.401 --> 19:57.780
- Help me here.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.949
Pop, can't you see, she wants

19:57.822 --> 19:59.949
to talk about the problem.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.117
She doesn't want you to buy

19:59.991 --> 20:01.117
her gifts.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.161
You can't just buy..

20:04.996 --> 20:06.372
Oh, boy.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.041
What's the matter?

20:08.082 --> 20:10.835
The geeky giant was right.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.754
Well, I did the same thing with

20:10.877 --> 20:13.754
D.J. that you're doing with mom.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.675
Pop, I got a lot of

20:15.255 --> 20:17.675
great things from you.

20:17.717 --> 20:21.428
I got your pride,

20:17.717 --> 20:21.428
your ambition, your hair.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.263
Thank you, by the way.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.307
But I also got your temper.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.518
And let's face it, it gets us in

20:25.349 --> 20:27.518
a lot of trouble, doesn't it?

20:30.146 --> 20:33.440
Are you two ready to

20:30.146 --> 20:33.440
really talk to each other?

20:33.482 --> 20:35.068
[chuckling]

20:35.109 --> 20:38.362
When you say "You two"

20:35.109 --> 20:38.362
you really mean me.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.490
I think we can

20:39.488 --> 20:41.490
do better, pop.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.285
- Yeah, you're right, Jess.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.285
- Good.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.830
'Cause this fog is gonna lift

20:45.327 --> 20:47.830
and, quite frankly, father

20:47.872 --> 20:49.248
you can't live here.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.792
That's my boy.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.588
About this drum thing,

20:53.836 --> 20:55.588
I'm sorry.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.423
I was wrong and you were right.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.843
Thanks, Jess.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.762
What's going on down there?

21:02.803 --> 21:04.304
D.J., what are you doin' up?

21:05.431 --> 21:07.474
Well, first it was Kimmy snoring

21:07.516 --> 21:09.602
and then there was a loud crash

21:09.643 --> 21:11.395
then people screaming.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.690
This time I was on my way

21:11.437 --> 21:14.690
back from the bathroom.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.151
Deej, can you come down here? I

21:14.732 --> 21:17.151
wanna talk to you for a second.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.694
Now?

21:18.736 --> 21:21.447
Jess, it's 3 o'clock

21:18.736 --> 21:21.447
in the morning. Can't it wait?

21:21.488 --> 21:24.366
Well, I just wanted to tell her

21:21.488 --> 21:24.366
I was wrong and you were right.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.078
D.J., get down here.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.580
Come on, honey. Uncle Jesse

21:27.120 --> 21:29.580
needs to talk to you right away.

21:31.165 --> 21:34.043
Dad, can I keep

21:31.165 --> 21:34.043
my drum set?

21:34.085 --> 21:36.087
Yes, you can

21:34.085 --> 21:36.087
keep the drums.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.463
Alright.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.840
But the sticks

21:37.504 --> 21:39.840
have gotta go.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.305
D.J...

21:47.848 --> 21:50.601
...I should have talked

21:47.848 --> 21:50.601
to you today about our fight

21:50.643 --> 21:52.853
instead of buying

21:50.643 --> 21:52.853
you a big gift.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.188
Don't be so

21:52.895 --> 21:54.188
hard on yourself.

21:58.442 --> 22:01.612
they don't like about

21:58.442 --> 22:01.612
themselves and...well

22:01.654 --> 22:03.656
me, I have my temper.

22:03.697 --> 22:07.076
And sometimes I say

22:03.697 --> 22:07.076
things the wrong way

22:07.118 --> 22:08.995
and I, and I hurt

22:07.118 --> 22:08.995
the people that I love.

[clicks tongue]

22:10.579 --> 22:13.582
I don't blame you

22:10.579 --> 22:13.582
for being mad at me.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.626
I did tape over

22:13.624 --> 22:15.626
your pancake jingle.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.670
[clicks tongue]

22:15.668 --> 22:17.670
Yeah, but I didn't

22:15.668 --> 22:17.670
handle it right.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.922
I mean, I embarrassed you

22:17.711 --> 22:19.922
in front of your friend

22:19.964 --> 22:21.590
and I hurt your feelings.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.592
And then I tried

22:21.632 --> 22:23.592
to buy your forgiveness.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.053
That was wrong.

22:28.222 --> 22:30.183
You know what I'm saying?

22:30.224 --> 22:31.767
Kind of.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.269
Maybe this will help you.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.814
When I was a kid

22:34.561 --> 22:36.814
and I did something wrong

22:36.856 --> 22:38.440
my dad would blow his top

22:38.482 --> 22:40.026
and send me to my room and..

22:40.067 --> 22:41.359
...a couple hours later

22:41.401 --> 22:45.198
he'd come back with

22:41.401 --> 22:45.198
a "Batman" comic book.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.616
And that's how I knew

22:45.239 --> 22:47.616
everything was okay.

22:47.658 --> 22:51.245
But we never...we never

22:47.658 --> 22:51.245
talked about the problem.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.080
You know, we never

22:51.287 --> 22:53.080
talked about our feelings

22:53.122 --> 22:55.124
the way that I felt.

22:55.166 --> 22:58.127
'I don't want that to

22:55.166 --> 22:58.127
happen to you and me.'

22:58.169 --> 23:00.671
I want our relationship

22:58.169 --> 23:00.671
to be better than that.

23:06.384 --> 23:07.928
I think we're

23:06.384 --> 23:07.928
doing pretty good.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.764
Huh, you ain't seen

23:07.970 --> 23:10.764
nothing yet, kid.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.187
When I was your age, I used

23:13.600 --> 23:16.187
to get in so much trouble.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.940
I remember this one time

23:17.479 --> 23:19.940
I was playing football

23:19.982 --> 23:21.359
and pop was watching TV.

23:21.399 --> 23:24.278
His favorite show,

23:21.399 --> 23:24.278
"The Beverly Hillbillies."

23:24.320 --> 23:26.822
I kicked a field goal

23:24.320 --> 23:26.822
right through Jethro's face.

[laughing]

23:30.284 --> 23:32.661
Oh, he yelled at

23:30.284 --> 23:32.661
me all night long.

23:32.703 --> 23:35.164
He had nothing better to do,

23:32.703 --> 23:35.164
the TV was busted.

23:35.206 --> 23:36.916
[chuckling]

23:36.957 --> 23:39.919
Anyway, kid, the point that

23:36.957 --> 23:39.919
I'm trying to make here is..

23:40.794 --> 23:41.879
D.J.?
