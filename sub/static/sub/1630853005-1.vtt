No.

You're just...

00:56.390 --> 00:57.792
I love you too.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.760
We're going to call her Felicity.

00:59.827 --> 01:00.728
Oh.

So time, space,

01:31.158 --> 01:33.394
history be damned.

01:33.461 --> 01:36.797
There are things that someone

02:04.358 --> 02:06.260
Doesna hurt a bit to die.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.728
I've paid my debt, and I'm finished

02:10.231 --> 02:11.632

02:21.809 --> 02:23.511

02:24.778 --> 02:26.146
What's the meaning of this?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.351
<i>Mama won't wake up.</i>

02:30.417 --> 02:33.220
- S-she's breathing.
- Claire!

02:33.287 --> 02:35.356
At the still, that was you.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.892
Aren't you the clever one, Dr. Rawlings?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.561
<i>Who's next for a go with the hedge whore?</i>

02:43.597 --> 02:45.666
You are alive. You are whole.

Kill them all.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.639

02:51.705 --> 02:53.240

02:53.307 --> 02:55.543
I will watch you burn in hell

02:55.609 --> 02:57.878
before I let you harm
another soul in this house.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.713
<i>...all pain encompassed,</i>

03:03.918 --> 03:06.186

03:06.253 --> 03:10.591
and you did what you must,
as will I, when the time comes.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.628
<i>And if time
is anything akin to God,</i>

03:14.695 --> 03:18.666
<i>I suppose that memory...
must be the devil.</i>

03:58.372 --> 03:59.640
<i>Here we are!</i>

04:00.975 --> 04:05.879
My Protestant friends,
we shall feast and be merry tonight!

04:07.681 --> 04:11.251
If the Lord provides
for the lowliest sparrow...

04:12.686 --> 04:14.788
...what will He not do for us?

04:21.395 --> 04:24.865
See? I warned
you about that sermonizing bastard.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.400
Aye.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.701
Now that you're here wi' us,

04:27.768 --> 04:28.969
<i>perhaps you can reason wi' him.</i>

04:29.036 --> 04:30.604
Why would he listen to me?

04:30.671 --> 04:32.272
<i>'Cause ye're Mac Dubh.</i>

04:32.740 --> 04:35.476
If anyone can put him
in his place, it's you.

04:41.682 --> 04:42.950
Carry on.

04:43.017 --> 04:44.752
<i>But, Mac Dubh,
you canna let him away wi' it.</i>

04:44.818 --> 04:45.819
My faithful subjects,

04:45.886 --> 04:47.588
how can we bear this injustice?

04:47.655 --> 04:50.858
We must have
provisions if we are to travel on

04:50.924 --> 04:53.427
<i>to Culloden to face the British army.</i>

04:53.494 --> 04:55.362
Got to keep our strength up!

04:55.429 --> 04:56.897
Will
someone shut that old fool up?

04:56.964 --> 04:59.533
Leave him alone. He's harmless.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.335
Dinna fear,
Your Royal Highness.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.970
I'll fetch one for ye.

05:03.037 --> 05:06.373
Thank you,
young James, most gracious.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.841
Of course, Sire.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.745
Rise at once!

05:11.812 --> 05:13.580
A true and loyal soldier

05:13.647 --> 05:15.382
bows to his future king,

05:15.449 --> 05:17.718
his Bonnie Prince.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.688
- You old fool! Get up, James.
- Hear, hear!

05:20.754 --> 05:23.023
You're a soldier in the army of the Lord,

05:23.090 --> 05:25.592
even if you are a damn papist.

05:25.659 --> 05:29.396
We're all prisoners here,
but you Catholics...

05:29.463 --> 05:30.597
There you go.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.666
Accept that Scotland's fate

05:32.733 --> 05:35.636
lies in the hands of a Protestant king!

05:37.004 --> 05:38.839
Bunch of heathens!

05:39.840 --> 05:40.674
<i>Stop!</i>

05:42.009 --> 05:42.943
Stop it!

05:49.049 --> 05:49.983
<i>Back!</i>

05:50.050 --> 05:52.352
<i>Get back! No!</i>

05:52.419 --> 05:54.988
<i>- Back!</i>

06:06.667 --> 06:09.837
What is keeping you
from eating, Mr. Christie?

06:10.771 --> 06:13.407
I'm certain it isn't a lack of appetite.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.377
Perhaps you think it impertinent of me

06:17.444 --> 06:19.913
not to have asked
our fellow here to dine with us.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.515
Of course not, sir.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.584
He's no different from the rest of them.

06:23.650 --> 06:24.718
I've done nothing.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.454
I have no wish to be here, sir.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.958
Good. With respect,
I don't want to have to see

06:31.024 --> 06:33.460
or hear of you more
than is strictly necessary.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.629
The feeling is mutual, Governor.

06:37.131 --> 06:38.465
Hmm.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.702
But when I hear reports of
a James bowing in homage to--

06:41.769 --> 06:42.970
Not this James, sir.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.139
'Twas the young lad, James McCready.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.040
<i>Huh.</i>

06:48.442 --> 06:52.479
Yes, I shouldn't have
thought the infamous Red Jamie

06:52.546 --> 06:54.114
would do such a thing.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.520
<i>But you must be wondering why I requested</i>

06:59.586 --> 07:01.588
your presence here, Mr. Fraser.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.792
Please, sit.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.102
As I said, I've done nothing.

07:31.185 --> 07:32.986
<i>I wanted to introduce myself</i>

07:33.620 --> 07:35.689
and to remind you both...

07:36.690 --> 07:38.559
of the civility that I expect,

07:38.759 --> 07:40.794
that which is preventing Mr. Christie here

07:40.861 --> 07:42.563
<i>from taking the first bite--</i>

07:42.963 --> 07:45.199
<i>the knowledge that I am your superior.</i>

07:46.567 --> 07:48.702
<i>I cannot have prisoners rioting</i>

07:48.769 --> 07:52.472
or bowing to one another like lairds.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.809
It's a flagrant
disrespect for rank and order,

07:56.610 --> 07:58.846
<i>an insult to His Majesty's army and to me.</i>

07:58.912 --> 08:01.181
If I may, Governor.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.484
Old Charlie is not of sound mind.

08:04.551 --> 08:07.988
And I believe myself to be
above consorting with madmen

08:08.055 --> 08:10.190
or degenerate prisoners!

08:18.131 --> 08:20.767
<i>There is nothing
stopping me from doing as I wish,</i>

08:20.834 --> 08:23.503
not even the thin veil
of courtesy between us.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.974
You are educated, Mr. Christie,
a man I can reason with.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.778
I know the men respect you as a soldier.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.082
<i>We were both on Culloden moor that day.</i>

08:37.184 --> 08:41.822
And now we're here, hmm,
making the best of things.

08:43.290 --> 08:46.093
<i>But my captain tells me your arrival here</i>

08:46.159 --> 08:50.063
<i>has, uh, excited the men.</i>

08:52.299 --> 08:55.168
Do nothing to further aggravate them.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.542
Well, then...

09:03.744 --> 09:06.780
how shall the men be
punished for their behavior, hmm?

09:07.080 --> 09:09.850
I believe they must be
taught a lesson, Governor.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.789
<i>Another day
of hard labor tomorrow...</i>

09:16.556 --> 09:17.858
for all but the two of you.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.594
Consider it a welcome, Mr. Fraser.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.766
<i>The guards will escort you back.</i>

09:33.173 --> 09:34.775
<i>Go.</i>

09:40.580 --> 09:41.748
Go.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.173
S-sorry. S-sorry. I-I didn't mean to.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.710
I've slowly been losing my sight.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.611
What are you doing?

10:11.678 --> 10:12.379
<i>I'm looking for a lock of hair.</i>

10:13.080 --> 10:14.781
It fell out when the guards found this.

10:14.848 --> 10:15.949
My...

10:16.016 --> 10:17.351
my Rebecca gave it to me.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.157
Probably long gone, lad.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.861
I'm...

10:28.261 --> 10:29.763
I'm forgetting her face.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.668
Is... is that what you did?

10:34.735 --> 10:37.104
<i>I heard the men say
your wife was gone and...</i>

10:42.809 --> 10:46.013
Mr. Christie tells me to
put my mind on God instead.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.418
Do you think it's all been for nothing,

10:52.953 --> 10:54.221
what we've been through?

10:54.354 --> 10:56.857
If there's a chance
she's waiting for you...

10:58.025 --> 10:59.159
then no.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.975
What we have known...

11:15.942 --> 11:17.277
some never will.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.680
<i>'Tisna just nor fair,</i>

11:21.181 --> 11:23.016
but it's eternal.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.153
And it's ours.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.390
If she loves you as you love her...

11:31.958 --> 11:33.293
she's always wi' ye, lad.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.699
Bring her to mind.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.202
<i>She'll come.</i>

12:07.894 --> 12:10.363
This wall, it will
shelter us from the traitors

12:10.430 --> 12:12.199
when we face them on the battlefield.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.435
Ah, it depends who you think
the traitors are, Charlie.

12:18.105 --> 12:21.007
What's wrong with you?
Why are you helping?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.076
You heard what the governor said.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.045
Doing what I can to get us out of here

12:25.112 --> 12:26.746
so I can serve my time in peace.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.949
And if you had a soul worth a damn,

12:29.015 --> 12:31.918
<i>since you keep preaching to
us about them, you'd do the same.</i>

12:31.985 --> 12:35.155
Him, lend a hand to help a lowly Jacobite?

12:35.222 --> 12:37.057
He'd rather see you fall at his feet

12:37.124 --> 12:38.892
and spit at you while you're down there.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.927

18:04.350 --> 18:06.453
<i>Christie said
you'd be a troublemaker,</i>

18:06.519 --> 18:08.254
and here we are.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.558
I have no quarrel with him,

18:11.624 --> 18:14.093
though he appears to have one with me.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.462
<i>Naturally,</i>

18:15.528 --> 18:18.631
<i>you being a Jacobite and him being a...</i>

18:19.466 --> 18:21.134
a more decent sort.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.103
All I want is to be left alone...

18:25.438 --> 18:27.240
to serve my time.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.275
Then why do you defy my orders?

18:29.342 --> 18:30.710
<i>A life was lost.</i>

18:30.777 --> 18:32.378
The men here are divided.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.282
All of Scotland's been
torn apart by this rebellion.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.819
Some here follow Christie

18:40.653 --> 18:42.856
'cause he told them if
they changed their beliefs,

18:43.857 --> 18:45.425
they willna feel afraid.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.594
Hmm.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.262
<i>But the fear is still there.</i>

18:50.830 --> 18:53.867
<i>They need food and medicine.</i>

18:54.133 --> 18:56.703
And they also need some peace.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.917
I think you want the same thing as me...

19:11.618 --> 19:13.553
to fulfill your duty...

19:14.354 --> 19:16.456
<i>move on to greener pastures.</i>

19:19.626 --> 19:21.694
I saw you and Christie...

19:22.829 --> 19:24.497
yer greetin'.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.700
<i>Make me a Freemason.</i>

19:32.438 --> 19:33.606
Why?

19:34.707 --> 19:37.310
Have you no regard for your Pope?

19:37.844 --> 19:39.612
<i>You'd be excommunicated.</i>

19:40.413 --> 19:42.849
The Pope isna here with me and my men.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.418
Any man can be a Mason,

19:46.419 --> 19:49.455
so long as he believes in a supreme being,

19:50.557 --> 19:51.891
as I do.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.932
But why do you want this?

20:02.602 --> 20:03.803
The men...

20:05.805 --> 20:07.440
they will listen to me.

20:31.965 --> 20:34.767
We'll have no more
of this senseless fighting.

20:41.608 --> 20:45.278
Catholics versus Protestants.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.715
We may not be stone masons,

20:49.816 --> 20:53.419
but we are, all of us, Scots.

20:55.488 --> 20:58.558
From now on, this prison will be a lodge,

20:59.325 --> 21:00.927
and we will be Freemasons,

21:01.594 --> 21:03.463
<i>united by our belief</i>

21:03.796 --> 21:05.732
<i>in the Great Architect of the Universe.</i>

21:06.532 --> 21:10.269
<i>But any talk of
politics or religion is forbidden.</i>

21:14.907 --> 21:16.309
Who will join me?

21:36.763 --> 21:38.031
<i>Fraser!</i>

21:39.666 --> 21:43.436
The governor will
see you for luncheon, now.

21:49.976 --> 21:50.910
<i>Go on, Mac Dubh.</i>

21:51.544 --> 21:53.079
Mebbe we'll have things a bit better.

Claire?

25:51.250 --> 25:52.585
Claire!

25:53.619 --> 25:55.755
Claire, wake up! Claire!

25:58.257 --> 26:01.093
Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ, Jamie.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.097
You scared me.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.066
<i>I find you here barely breathing,</i>

26:07.133 --> 26:08.234
thinking you've gone
to meet Christ Himself,

26:08.301 --> 26:10.303
and I'm the one scaring you?

26:11.904 --> 26:13.005
Oh.

26:13.639 --> 26:14.740
I'm all right.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.879
Better than all right, actually.

26:25.618 --> 26:26.919
It worked.

26:31.657 --> 26:35.294
I was only out for three to four minutes.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.331
What the devil are you talking about?

26:38.731 --> 26:41.600
We don't have to rely on
Whisky or laudanum anymore.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.037
Something to confess, Sassenach?

26:45.237 --> 26:46.672
Yes.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.675
I've re-created anesthetic.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.377
It's called Ether.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.279
And it sent you to sleep?

26:53.346 --> 26:55.314
Something deeper than sleep.

26:56.315 --> 26:57.616
What does that feel like?

26:57.683 --> 26:59.251
Well, that's the beauty of it.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.654
You don't feel a thing.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.289
Is it safe?

27:03.856 --> 27:05.391
Well, it's safer than dying in agony

27:05.658 --> 27:06.926
of a ruptured appendix.

27:07.259 --> 27:10.363
No, w-with Ether,
now I could operate on a patient,

27:10.629 --> 27:13.866
and, well, they wouldn't
feel a thing, well, not until--

27:13.933 --> 27:15.401
Until they wake up, hmm.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.636
Well, that doesn't sound
very good to me, Sassenach.

27:17.703 --> 27:18.904
No?

27:18.971 --> 27:20.740
It's bloody marvelous.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.210
It would be a shame not to feel anything.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.851
This isn't standard
treatment for all my patients.

27:32.118 --> 27:34.186
Well, I hope not.

27:34.687 --> 27:37.690
Shame we can't put
everyone to sleep for 100 years

27:37.757 --> 27:39.091
but the two of us.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.793
And stop time.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.962
- Wouldn't that be lovely?
- Mm.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.334
Wait for this war to be over.

27:49.402 --> 27:54.006
Forget about the Browns,
their committee of safety.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.008
Keep to ourselves.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.082
- Ah, could we do that?
- Hmm.

28:04.683 --> 28:09.055
Major MacDonald has
asked me to be an Indian agent,

28:09.688 --> 28:13.259
to act as a representative for the Crown

28:13.325 --> 28:14.960
with the Cherokee hereabouts

28:15.027 --> 28:17.797
and to improve
relations with our Indian neighbors.

28:18.831 --> 28:20.099
Oh, they want you to convince them

28:20.166 --> 28:21.400
to keep fighting for the king.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.035
Hmm.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.704
New governor, same thumb.

28:26.839 --> 28:27.973
I'll tell him no.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.043
Good. I'd best go and look in on Marsali.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.059
I am all right, you know.

28:48.928 --> 28:49.995
Aye, I ken.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.731
It's...

28:54.100 --> 28:56.268
I take pleasure in
the sight of you is all.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.509
You've been like my shadow ever since...

29:08.280 --> 29:09.915
Are you going to accompany me

29:09.982 --> 29:12.184
on every home visit
from now to kingdom come?

29:13.986 --> 29:15.921
And long after that, Sassenach.

29:20.192 --> 29:23.963
I swear Mrs. Bug has
a knack for hiding parcels.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.168
Right, then, tea or coffee?

29:29.235 --> 29:31.770
Whatever you can find, I guess.

29:31.837 --> 29:32.805
Ah.

29:35.841 --> 29:37.376
Imagine how many good cuppas

29:37.443 --> 29:40.112
<i>are gonna be tossed
into that bloody harbor.</i>

29:40.179 --> 29:41.914
Hey, whose side are you on?

29:41.981 --> 29:44.783
Oh, don't forget your mother
and I were both on the losing side.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.987
Oh, you know, I haven't forgotten.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.355
But now that you're here,

29:49.421 --> 29:52.791
I mean, you're obviously a patriot, right?

29:53.058 --> 29:54.226
Well, of course.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.328
If America doesn't become America,

29:56.395 --> 29:58.164
who knows what that world'll look like?

29:58.564 --> 29:59.498
Hmm.

30:00.065 --> 30:03.235
World War I, World War II,
how might they play out?

30:03.569 --> 30:04.537
Oh...

30:05.871 --> 30:07.473
it's really starting to hit me.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.376
The clock is ticking.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.011
I know.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.414
What can we do?

30:20.352 --> 30:23.389
Here we go,
up and away with Granddad.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.294
Are we explorers?

30:29.028 --> 30:31.197
Are you ready to go
wherever the wind takes us?

30:31.931 --> 30:33.933
Germain, hold on to your sister.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.874
- Fergus away at the still?
- Aye.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.309
Canna seem to keep him away.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.311
He wants it back as it was.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.147
Well, they'll have to be patient.

30:48.214 --> 30:51.450
Like all things, good Whisky takes time.

30:52.384 --> 30:55.421
So has the baby been
moving much these last few days?

30:55.487 --> 30:58.357
No, not as much as he was.

30:58.424 --> 31:00.092
But they don't really, do they?

31:00.159 --> 31:01.527
Not when they're nearly ready.

31:02.428 --> 31:05.397
I mean, Joanie lay there like the dea--

31:06.465 --> 31:08.901
like a millstone, I mean--

31:08.968 --> 31:10.603
the night before the waters broke.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.005
They often do that--

31:13.072 --> 31:16.375
rest up before their grand entrance.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.012
I've just...

31:20.079 --> 31:22.615
I've been clumsy of late.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.150
Wee bit tired is all.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.655
Well, have you been
having any pain in your belly

31:29.922 --> 31:31.590
- or any bleeding at all?
- No.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.562
Right, well...

31:36.629 --> 31:40.032
we'd best keep a careful
eye on you at this late stage.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.234
Make sure Fergus looks
after you when he's at home.

31:42.301 --> 31:43.902
You shouldn't be
running around after the little ones

31:43.969 --> 31:45.371
and doing all the housework as well.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.444
Can I help you?

32:26.178 --> 32:27.379
<i>Ah.</i>

32:28.347 --> 32:29.982
Good day.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.718
And who might you be?

32:33.619 --> 32:34.987
I might ask you the same thing

32:35.054 --> 32:36.422
since you knocked the door.

32:36.488 --> 32:37.656
I was given to understand

32:37.723 --> 32:39.725
that this is Fraser's Ridge, so...

32:41.493 --> 32:44.096
I'm Roger MacKenzie.
I'm Mr. Fraser's son-in-law.

32:44.163 --> 32:47.232
<i>Mm, might
I speak with Mr. Fraser, then?</i>

32:47.299 --> 32:48.967
<i>I'm afraid
he and his wife are out at present.</i>

32:54.006 --> 32:55.641
Please, come in.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.299
Perhaps I can be of service to you, Mr....

33:20.366 --> 33:21.667
Thomas Christie.

33:22.668 --> 33:26.205
Yes, perhaps you may, Mr. MacKenzie.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.641
I was told that Mr. Fraser
might be in a position

33:29.708 --> 33:32.077
to put something suitable my way.

33:34.213 --> 33:35.414
Found it in the back--

33:36.215 --> 33:39.718
Uh, this is Brianna MacKenzie, my wife.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.754
Brianna, this is Mr. Christie.

33:42.287 --> 33:43.422
Nice to meet you.

33:44.590 --> 33:47.226
Uh, my son and
daughter have come with me, too,

33:47.292 --> 33:48.460
and a-and a few others--

33:48.527 --> 33:50.195
Fisherfolk from the old country.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.164
I've left them a few miles up the river

33:52.231 --> 33:56.034
so that I could
speak with Mr. Fraser first.

33:56.101 --> 33:57.069
They, uh...

33:58.103 --> 34:00.606
they had nowhere to go, but, uh, well...

34:04.777 --> 34:05.778
...I did.

34:12.084 --> 34:13.786
Oh, you know my father from Ardsmuir?

34:14.553 --> 34:15.487
I do.

34:16.522 --> 34:19.425
Well, there are some
faces I'm sure you'll recognize--

34:20.125 --> 34:22.528
Ronnie Sinclair, the Lindsay brothers.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.396
Be a while since
you've seen them, I imagine.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.198
Mm.

34:26.799 --> 34:28.634
I hope it isn't an inconvenience.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.302
Nonsense.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.304
No, delighted to
have you and glad to help.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.774
Any friend of Mr. Fraser's is welcome.

34:38.777 --> 34:39.812
Welcome to the Ridge.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.815
- Thank you.
- <i>You must be hungry.</i>

34:43.081 --> 34:45.217
I'll make you some food
while we wait for my parents.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.286
Please.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.121
Thank you.

35:00.833 --> 35:03.469
So you'll have been indentured

35:03.535 --> 35:05.170
after prison, I take it?

35:05.237 --> 35:07.439
As a schoolmaster. My, uh...

35:08.173 --> 35:09.741
my employer died.

35:10.476 --> 35:11.643
Oh, sorry.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.412
No.

35:13.479 --> 35:14.780
It's not pity I want, sir.

35:14.847 --> 35:16.548
No, of course not.

35:18.884 --> 35:21.653
I'm something of a schoolmaster myself.

35:22.321 --> 35:25.591
Or was... once upon a time.

35:27.192 --> 35:28.827
<i>Is there a schoolhouse on the Ridge?</i>

35:28.894 --> 35:30.896
No, not yet,
but we do intend to build one.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.732
For now, I've been teaching
my wee lad his letters.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.668
As long as there's a church.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.671
A man must surely build a house for God

35:39.738 --> 35:41.840
before building a home for himself.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.445
Aye, well, we don't
have a church yet either.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.147
But that sounds like
something my father would've said.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.851
He was a minister.
Of course, he was Presbyterian.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.620
My side of the family is Protestant.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.622
I am not Catholic.

35:57.189 --> 35:58.824
There were some of us at Ardsmuir

35:58.891 --> 36:03.195
who merely wanted
Scotland's interest best served

36:03.262 --> 36:04.663
rather than the Pope's.

36:07.232 --> 36:10.302
<i>The wee ones
were asking all sorts of questions.</i>

36:10.369 --> 36:13.238
I have to say, Sassenach,
I wasna sure how to explain

36:13.305 --> 36:15.841
that isn't a stork who'll
be bringing the new bairn.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.177
We're back.

36:19.244 --> 36:20.546
We saw Marsali.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.621
There's a face
I never thought I'd see again.

36:30.255 --> 36:31.857
<i>Tom Christie.</i>

36:31.924 --> 36:33.525
James Fraser.

36:35.394 --> 36:38.830
I stand before you in humble gratitude.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.937
Uh, with Mr. Christie
being an Ardsmuir man,

36:45.203 --> 36:46.872
I assumed that, uh...

36:47.873 --> 36:49.975
Well, I welcomed him right away.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.548
Of course.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.884
Good to see you, Tom.

36:58.951 --> 37:01.420
To stay, that is.

37:01.954 --> 37:03.388
To settle here.

37:06.458 --> 37:10.395
Your daughter was kind
enough to offer me a bite to eat.

37:11.730 --> 37:12.731
<i>Good.</i>

37:15.400 --> 37:17.769
This is my wife, Claire Fraser.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.590
Do you have enough
supplies for all the newcomers?

37:38.657 --> 37:40.425
Ah, well, I hope so.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.897
- Opening a bar?
- Ha.

37:46.632 --> 37:49.735
I am distilling Ether for anesthetic.

37:50.302 --> 37:51.536
Hmm, pretty radical.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.639
I prefer the term "revolutionary."

37:54.272 --> 37:56.441
Well, a lot of folk'll be
using that term soon enough.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.610
Revolution of hearts and minds.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.545
Hmm. Isn't that true?

38:02.347 --> 38:03.915
I'm so glad you didn't lose your heart...

38:05.317 --> 38:06.318
and your spirit.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.657
And I hope
that you are taking care of yourself.

38:13.692 --> 38:14.893
I'm fine, darling.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.767
You know, there was a time,
when someone asked me,

38:21.833 --> 38:23.735
I'd say, "I'm fine," too.

38:26.538 --> 38:27.939
Well, what have you been doing lately?

38:28.006 --> 38:29.775
Have you been working on anything new?

38:29.841 --> 38:32.344
Not really.
I have some designs, but...

38:32.411 --> 38:33.712
What?

38:33.779 --> 38:35.547
Designs on paper are well and good

38:35.614 --> 38:37.683
<i>but not if they remain there.</i>

38:38.684 --> 38:41.019
- I mean...
- What?

38:41.086 --> 38:42.788
It's just...

38:42.854 --> 38:44.690
Mama, with what happened to you...

38:44.756 --> 38:46.725
Bree, you can't live your life

38:46.792 --> 38:48.760
afraid of being who you are.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.063
I know, but I don't want
the folk on the Ridge

38:51.329 --> 38:52.531
to be afraid of my ideas.

38:52.597 --> 38:53.932
<i>Well, they might be,</i>

38:53.999 --> 38:55.467
<i>but you can't worry about that.</i>

38:55.667 --> 38:58.503
We're just trying to
make their lives better

38:58.570 --> 39:00.539
using our knowledge as a gift.

39:00.605 --> 39:03.542
And some will appreciate your inventions.

39:03.608 --> 39:05.010
Some won't.

39:11.783 --> 39:14.052
I'll tell you what--
if anyone makes a fuss,

39:14.119 --> 39:15.754
we'll just remind them that the Romans

39:15.821 --> 39:18.123
used to have
plumbing and underfloor heating.

39:18.390 --> 39:19.958
Underfloor heating?

39:20.692 --> 39:22.828
Well, I'm still at
the waterwheel stage, so...

39:25.097 --> 39:26.732
Come on.

39:26.798 --> 39:29.067
Let's go see if
we can help these Fisherfolk.

39:56.661 --> 39:58.530
We were starting to worry, Father.

39:58.597 --> 40:02.734
Aye.
This is my daughter, Malva,

40:02.801 --> 40:05.070
<i>and my son, Allan.</i>

40:05.137 --> 40:07.472
We need no introduction to you,
Mr. Fraser,

40:07.539 --> 40:09.875
- having heard so much.
- A pleasure, sir...

40:09.941 --> 40:12.511
to meet such an old friend of my father's.

40:13.478 --> 40:15.881
Thank you. The pleasure's mine.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.616
This is my wife, Claire Fraser.

40:17.682 --> 40:19.618
Delighted to meet you both.

40:19.684 --> 40:21.153
- We brought you some food.
- Aye.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.121
Perhaps you might help unload

40:23.188 --> 40:25.590
the wagon there for Mr. Fraser, Allan.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.526
Yes, Father.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.060
Miss Christie,
could you take me to anyone

40:29.127 --> 40:30.796
who's injured or unwell?

40:31.163 --> 40:32.464
I'm a healer.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.833
Yes, mistress.

40:39.171 --> 40:41.640
Aye.

40:41.706 --> 40:44.876
All this land--impressive.

40:45.477 --> 40:46.945
Hmm. Aye.

40:47.012 --> 40:48.446
We're fortunate,

40:48.747 --> 40:51.817
although we've faced
our share of hardships.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.451
Oh.

40:53.518 --> 40:55.554
More than fortune, I think.

40:56.054 --> 40:58.123
Seems the Great Architect of the Universe

40:58.190 --> 41:00.759
has seen fit to put
some blessings your way.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.596
Perhaps you can have my
share of the blessings, Tom,

41:04.663 --> 41:06.064
and I can have some peace and quiet.

41:06.565 --> 41:09.734
<i>My wife would certainly thank you for it.</i>

41:16.208 --> 41:17.809
<i>Given everything that passed</i>

41:17.876 --> 41:19.644
<i>between you and Tom at Ardsmuir,</i>

41:19.711 --> 41:21.680
do you really think
the Ridge is the best place

41:21.746 --> 41:22.781
for him to settle?

41:25.083 --> 41:28.753
No, when I sent out
word to all Ardsmuir men,

41:28.820 --> 41:31.223
couldn't very well
say all of them but one.

41:33.825 --> 41:37.195
Well, we'll need more
food to keep them going,

41:37.929 --> 41:41.099
some spare clothes,
anything else we have, really.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.702
A lot of mend and make do,

41:44.269 --> 41:45.537
but we're good at that.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.039
Aye.

41:51.276 --> 41:55.513
I think Tom received
word his wife had died

41:55.580 --> 41:56.982
while we were at Ardsmuir.

41:57.048 --> 41:58.183
But you...

42:00.252 --> 42:03.054
...you were there with me in the present.

42:03.922 --> 42:05.657
I saw you.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.295
It's what got me through it.

42:12.063 --> 42:14.132
You were always with me.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.604
Sometimes, uh...

42:21.072 --> 42:23.775
...I think you're an angel, Claire.

42:37.022 --> 42:38.657
Would an angel...

42:41.593 --> 42:42.761
...do this?

43:11.790 --> 43:13.158
Or this?

43:19.664 --> 43:21.132
<i>How about...</i>

43:23.969 --> 43:25.203
...this?

43:41.786 --> 43:43.321
Maybe I've died...

43:45.657 --> 43:47.292
...gone to heaven.

45:37.469 --> 45:38.903
Morning, darling.

45:38.970 --> 45:41.806
How did you get on with
the phosphorous Lord John sent?

45:41.873 --> 45:43.274
I might have to steal some.

45:43.341 --> 45:45.243
Mistress Fraser?

45:45.810 --> 45:49.047
Malva. I was expecting Brianna.

45:49.114 --> 45:50.315
Lucifer.

45:52.117 --> 45:54.486
Phosphorus,
Greek for "light bringer"

45:54.752 --> 45:56.287
or Lucifer in Latin.

45:57.789 --> 45:59.224
Dad taught me what he knows.

45:59.290 --> 46:01.092
He knows a lot about the devil too.

46:03.394 --> 46:05.330
We're lucky to have such educated people

46:05.396 --> 46:07.232
joining us on the Ridge.

46:07.832 --> 46:10.435
You know, Mr. Fraser knows
Greek and Latin too.

46:11.836 --> 46:14.506
But what did you mean by it?
What's it for?

46:16.841 --> 46:19.811
It's an ingredient of sorts.

46:19.878 --> 46:23.948
But your, um...
your father was a schoolmaster.

46:24.482 --> 46:26.284
Did he ever teach you any science?

46:26.351 --> 46:30.522
He prefers theology, history,

46:30.788 --> 46:33.458
some natural history, grammar.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.503
The name Lucifer brings
to mind the burning fires of hell.

46:47.105 --> 46:49.207
Are you going to use
the phosphorus to light a fire?

46:51.176 --> 46:52.377
We'll see.

46:52.944 --> 46:55.980
But I shouldn't keep you.
Do you need something?

46:56.047 --> 46:57.315
Oh, yes.

46:58.016 --> 46:59.484
Do you have a loaf of bread?

46:59.551 --> 47:01.953
My father wants it for the congregation.

47:04.222 --> 47:07.091
If it's bread ye're after,
Miss Christie,

47:07.158 --> 47:09.294
I have some right here,
freshly baked.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.596
- Thank you, Mrs. Bug.
- Thank you, Mistress Fraser.

47:25.210 --> 47:27.178
You have my answer,
Major MacDonald.

47:27.612 --> 47:29.013
And you're certain it's the one

47:29.080 --> 47:31.316
I should convey to Governor Martin, hmm?

47:31.616 --> 47:33.318
"I regret to inform Your Excellency

47:33.384 --> 47:36.554
that Colonel Fraser of
Rowan County has refused"--

47:36.621 --> 47:40.391
Has respectfully declined,
and I'm no longer colonel.

47:40.458 --> 47:43.494
"Has refused to accept a position

47:43.861 --> 47:46.064
"as Indian agent in
the service of the Crown

47:46.130 --> 47:48.166
"and therefore to
maintain peace and prosperity

47:48.233 --> 47:50.368
"in the province by entering into talks

47:50.435 --> 47:52.070
and trading with the Indians."

47:52.136 --> 47:53.404
Oh, as for peace,
it's the only thing I want.

47:53.471 --> 47:55.306
Then I hope you'll change your mind,

47:55.373 --> 47:56.641
for the sake of peace.

47:57.375 --> 47:59.644
My mind is made up, Major.

48:00.411 --> 48:02.580
War is an expensive business.

48:03.448 --> 48:05.049
Governor Tryon said

48:05.116 --> 48:07.452
he'd defer payment
of the tax on your land.

48:07.518 --> 48:11.289
Governor Martin owes you no such courtesy.

48:13.258 --> 48:15.360
If the governor requires taxes,

48:15.426 --> 48:17.495
we'll pay our fair share.

48:18.263 --> 48:20.031
Our settlers have worked hard.

48:20.098 --> 48:21.532
We have new settlers,
arrived this week.

48:22.233 --> 48:24.369
Today we begin building their cabins.

48:25.270 --> 48:27.472
But you're welcome to stay
the night in our guest chamber.

48:27.538 --> 48:29.641
Your men may quarter in the stables.

48:29.907 --> 48:32.076
That's kind,
but I must take my leave of you.

48:32.143 --> 48:34.646
I have business in Brownsville.

48:35.313 --> 48:36.514
Ah, don't look too relieved.

48:36.581 --> 48:39.050
I'll stop by again on my way back,

48:39.117 --> 48:40.985
in case you have a change of heart.

48:52.630 --> 48:54.666
<i>Praise be to God.</i>

48:59.170 --> 49:00.438
Let us pray.

49:05.009 --> 49:08.279
Jesus fed the 5,000
with fishes and loaves,

49:08.346 --> 49:11.549
<i>but our own miracle is in coming here...</i>

49:12.450 --> 49:13.718
finding a home,

49:15.186 --> 49:17.121
doing what we can to help.

49:17.388 --> 49:19.657
In return,
we will build them a school,

49:19.724 --> 49:21.225
<i>build them a church,</i>

49:21.292 --> 49:22.460
show them

49:23.161 --> 49:26.631
what pious men and women of faith can do.

49:26.698 --> 49:28.333
A church, you say?

49:30.635 --> 49:32.103
Sorry we missed your sermon.

49:32.503 --> 49:35.139
<i>I was only giving a word of thanks</i>

49:35.206 --> 49:37.308
before we begin our day.

49:39.110 --> 49:40.478
It's what we do.

49:41.346 --> 49:42.513
<i>There's much to do.</i>

49:43.214 --> 49:46.017
Has anyone here built a cabin before?

49:51.489 --> 49:52.690
Well, then, Mr. Christie,

49:54.158 --> 49:57.495
mebbe I should
explain how we do things here.

50:09.741 --> 50:12.009
Right.

50:15.546 --> 50:17.148
I'll catch up with you.

50:17.749 --> 50:20.351
Um, shouldn't you be at home resting?

50:22.553 --> 50:24.188
Where are the little ones?

50:24.255 --> 50:25.723
Lizzie took them for
a walk to tire them out,

50:25.790 --> 50:28.526
and I didn't want to be by myself.

50:28.593 --> 50:30.194
Are you a widow as well?

50:31.229 --> 50:32.330
No.

50:32.797 --> 50:37.502
Uh, no--uh, my husband,
he looks after the still.

50:37.568 --> 50:41.205
Uh, it burnt down,
and we rebuilt it,

50:41.272 --> 50:43.374
and then he obviously
has been trying to fix it.

50:43.441 --> 50:44.475
Forgive me.

50:45.576 --> 50:47.078
It's been so hard with the bairns,

50:47.145 --> 50:48.546
and when I heard you say you were alone...

50:49.280 --> 50:52.049
Oh, I'm sorry for your loss.

50:54.318 --> 50:55.353
Oh.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.091
It's bloody awful, that one.

51:01.125 --> 51:03.628
Her husband died
a month ago on the ship over.

51:04.295 --> 51:06.230
<i>Left with two young bairns.</i>

51:07.131 --> 51:09.267
Keep thinking about you in her place.

51:10.134 --> 51:12.403
<i>I wish there
was something we could do.</i>

51:14.338 --> 51:17.375
I could see if any of Jem's
old clothes might fit the kids.

51:17.442 --> 51:19.777
It's not much,
but it's a start.

51:19.844 --> 51:21.646
Oh, that's a good idea.

51:22.780 --> 51:23.748
Let's have a think.

51:23.815 --> 51:25.616
There may be
something more we can do as well.

51:26.184 --> 51:27.151
Yeah.

51:58.850 --> 52:00.218
Fergus.

52:04.455 --> 52:07.325
<i>Better to be late than never.</i>

52:08.459 --> 52:11.462
You, uh, seem cheerful.

52:12.663 --> 52:14.465
You trying the new Whisky?

52:14.532 --> 52:16.167
Working at the still.

52:16.234 --> 52:19.237
Hmm. Well, dinna work too hard.

52:19.303 --> 52:22.340
Mebbe spend a bit
more time at home, eh, lad?

52:22.406 --> 52:23.274
Aye.

53:14.392 --> 53:15.960
<i>You're
a good shot with that thing.</i>

53:18.529 --> 53:21.232
But I'd prefer to
stick with my trusty rifle.

53:24.302 --> 53:25.836
The Mohawk taught you?

53:25.903 --> 53:29.640
Aye. Dinna have to worry
about running out of gunpowder.

53:29.707 --> 53:31.475
I don't have to worry too much about that.

53:34.412 --> 53:35.813
I have this.

53:37.848 --> 53:41.218
The carvings.
Where did ye get it?

53:43.821 --> 53:45.289
I made it myself.

53:47.358 --> 53:48.659
Did yer father teach ye how to shoot?

53:52.430 --> 53:53.431
No.

53:55.433 --> 53:56.834
No, he'd say,

53:57.435 --> 54:00.771
"Son, lay down thy weapons...

54:02.607 --> 54:04.742
"...and take up the shield of faith,

54:05.476 --> 54:07.712
"wherewith you shall be able to quench

54:07.778 --> 54:11.015
all the fiery darts of the wicked."

54:17.922 --> 54:20.324
Is this one of the fiery darts?

54:21.325 --> 54:24.562
I imagine he wouldna
approve of some of my customs.

54:40.411 --> 54:42.013
<i>You ought to be careful, son!</i>

54:44.348 --> 54:46.751
Almost mistook you for an Indian,

54:46.817 --> 54:50.421
<i>one who's hunting on
the wrong side of the treaty line.</i>

54:50.488 --> 54:53.858
- You ken very well who I am!
- <i>Oh, I do.</i>

54:53.924 --> 54:55.660
<i>You're kin of the Frasers.</i>

54:56.360 --> 54:57.828
Perhaps you should take care to dress

54:57.895 --> 54:59.897
in a more civilized fashion.

55:01.899 --> 55:05.369
<i>I've heard there's
real Indians still a-roaming,</i>

55:06.070 --> 55:08.439
setting cabins on fire.

55:08.506 --> 55:11.742
You have no proof
Indians set any of those fires.

55:11.809 --> 55:13.044
If my Uncle heard you--

55:13.310 --> 55:15.680
We're representing the law.

55:18.449 --> 55:20.785
<i>This is my committee of safety.</i>

55:23.888 --> 55:25.556
We're seeking justice.

55:26.657 --> 55:29.727
<i>I'm sure your Uncle wouldn't disapprove.</i>

55:54.885 --> 55:56.587
What happened?

55:57.088 --> 55:59.690
My hand slipped cutting rushes.

55:59.757 --> 56:02.059
See? Look at all this, Da.

56:02.126 --> 56:03.127
Told you she could help.

56:03.394 --> 56:06.831
Perhaps, Malva,
you could see how Allan is faring.

56:06.897 --> 56:08.966
You'll need to cook whatever he's shot.

56:09.033 --> 56:10.034
But--

56:13.504 --> 56:15.406
- Yes, Da.
- Ah.

56:18.743 --> 56:21.879
These things usually
look a lot worse than they are.

56:26.751 --> 56:28.018
Ooh.

56:28.085 --> 56:29.153
- Jamie.
- Claire.

56:31.856 --> 56:33.891
Tom. Tom.

56:34.992 --> 56:36.160
<i>Is it bad?</i>

56:36.427 --> 56:38.129
No, but he just fainted.

56:38.896 --> 56:40.731
Do you need to lie down?

56:45.803 --> 56:48.539
<i>I only felt lightheaded for a moment.</i>

56:48.606 --> 56:51.609
Aye, shall I, uh,
fetch you a dram, Tom?

56:51.675 --> 56:52.943
I ken you dinna hold a strong drink,

56:53.010 --> 56:55.412
but, uh, there's a time for it, surely.

56:55.479 --> 56:58.582
Aye, no, 'tis the devil's juice.

56:58.649 --> 57:01.719
"Take a little wine
for thy stomach's sake."

57:01.786 --> 57:05.189
1 Timothy 5:23.

57:05.456 --> 57:06.590
Take heart, man.

57:06.657 --> 57:07.858
<i>I'll fetch it.</i>

57:08.893 --> 57:11.595
Some of us Catholics can read--
in English too.

57:11.662 --> 57:13.464
I hope so, seeing as there
aren't many priests

57:13.531 --> 57:14.665
in the province.

57:15.833 --> 57:18.669
Now, keep that upright.

57:18.736 --> 57:19.970
Oh.

57:21.539 --> 57:23.440
I'm not surprised the knife slipped.

57:23.874 --> 57:25.643
<i>I'm surprised you could hold it at all.</i>

57:26.443 --> 57:27.778
You know, I can correct this.

57:30.548 --> 57:32.983
I do not want... desire...

57:33.050 --> 57:34.518
Well, if you don't let me fix it,

57:34.585 --> 57:36.587
that hand will be useless in six months.

57:36.654 --> 57:37.855
I'll manage.

57:38.522 --> 57:39.657
Best listen to her.

57:50.668 --> 57:52.570
I need you to keep your hand still.

57:54.004 --> 57:55.206
Rest it on the table.

58:29.607 --> 58:33.043
Now, you need to keep this wound clean.

58:33.110 --> 58:35.045
<i>I'll make up an ointment for it.</i>

58:35.112 --> 58:37.615
<i>You can send Malva round for it later.</i>

58:38.015 --> 58:39.817
<i>And I'll check it again
when you bring your family</i>

58:39.884 --> 58:41.518
<i>to the hog roast tomorrow.</i>

58:42.219 --> 58:44.054
And while I'm at it...

58:44.889 --> 58:46.690
why don't I fix that other hand?

58:48.025 --> 58:49.593
<i>On you go, then, Tom.</i>

58:50.661 --> 58:52.696
<i>It's naught but a nick.</i>

58:52.763 --> 58:53.664
I've had worse.

58:58.869 --> 58:59.703
There.

59:01.138 --> 59:02.907
Thank you.

59:07.745 --> 59:10.247
At least it will be an honorable scar,

59:10.981 --> 59:12.182
won't it, Mac Dubh?

59:22.326 --> 59:24.561
By God,
he's a stiff-necked bastard.

59:24.628 --> 59:26.764
Why on earth would he say that?

59:26.830 --> 59:28.265
Those are honorable scars.

59:28.332 --> 59:32.002
The flogging at Ardsmuir,
he saw my back. Hmm.

59:32.069 --> 59:34.638
Must've thought I'd done
something to deserve them.

59:34.705 --> 59:38.575
And he didn't like me
watching him sweat, I expect.

59:38.642 --> 59:40.210
Then why did you stay?

59:40.277 --> 59:43.914
Because I kent he wouldna whimper

59:43.981 --> 59:46.016
or faint again if I did.

59:47.952 --> 59:50.754
He'd let you thrust red-hot
needles through his eyeballs

59:50.821 --> 59:53.023
before he'd squeal in front of me.

59:53.090 --> 59:55.759
My God, you're like wild rams,

59:55.826 --> 59:57.995
butting heads to see who's strongest.

59:58.062 --> 1:00:00.831
<i>Years he lived
with men who had the Gaelic</i>

1:00:00.898 --> 1:00:02.633
<i>and wouldna lower himself</i>

1:00:02.700 --> 1:00:04.168
to let a word of such a barbarous tongue

1:00:04.234 --> 1:00:05.669
pass his lips.

1:00:06.804 --> 1:00:08.806
But a man stubborn enough

1:00:08.872 --> 1:00:11.342
to speak English to Highland men

1:00:11.608 --> 1:00:14.144
<i>is a man stubborn enough to fight...</i>

1:00:14.211 --> 1:00:17.047
and beside me,
should it come to it.

1:00:54.251 --> 1:00:55.919
<i>- Sláinte.
- </i> Sláinte.

1:00:55.986 --> 1:00:59.289
Enjoy that, because I haven't
much left of the older stock.

1:01:00.024 --> 1:01:02.693
Must've heard about the fire,
destroyed my Whisky still.

1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:03.861
Aye.

1:01:04.762 --> 1:01:06.864
Richard Brown thinks
it was the Indians, you know.

1:01:07.431 --> 1:01:09.733
Ah, he's brought some
information to my attention

1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:10.701
about the fires.

1:01:10.768 --> 1:01:14.371
And impressed the governor
with his committee of safety,

1:01:15.339 --> 1:01:18.275
which is why I'm offering him
the position as Indian agent.

1:01:19.910 --> 1:01:21.779
Surely you dinna believe him.

1:01:21.845 --> 1:01:24.948
It wasn't the Indians.
It was them, the Browns.

1:01:25.416 --> 1:01:28.419
- His brother--
- Don't do this to me.

1:01:29.186 --> 1:01:31.989
You're both respected in the province.

1:01:32.456 --> 1:01:35.225
It's one man's word against another's.

1:01:36.927 --> 1:01:38.162
Ah.

1:01:38.796 --> 1:01:40.998
Oh, my, uh, apologies.

1:01:41.065 --> 1:01:42.032
We're, uh...

1:01:42.766 --> 1:01:45.702
we're a little early for the festivities.

1:01:45.769 --> 1:01:47.171
Mr. Christie.

1:01:48.739 --> 1:01:52.743
May I present Major MacDonald,
who'll be joining us?

1:01:52.810 --> 1:01:56.413
This is Mr. Tom Christie
and his son and daughter,

1:01:56.480 --> 1:01:58.015
<i>Allan and Malva Christie.</i>

1:02:00.317 --> 1:02:03.120
Well, never too
early for a celebratory drink

1:02:03.187 --> 1:02:04.254
before we eat.

1:02:04.888 --> 1:02:07.291
So generous of Mr.
and Mistress Fraser to host us.

1:02:07.357 --> 1:02:10.394
Ah, no Whisky, thank you.

1:02:10.461 --> 1:02:13.997
But yes, indeed,
they have been more than gracious.

1:02:15.833 --> 1:02:17.801
<i>Will Mistress Fraser
be joining us?</i>

1:02:19.169 --> 1:02:21.505
She's been so kind,
I'm eager to thank her.

1:02:22.306 --> 1:02:23.307
Aye.

1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:26.410
I believe she's tending
to some final preparations--

1:02:26.477 --> 1:02:29.046
a wee surprise for some of the children.

1:02:30.247 --> 1:02:32.316
You live like a king,
Mr. Fraser.

1:02:32.916 --> 1:02:36.186
Yes, you've certainly
come a long way from Ardsmuir.

1:02:39.490 --> 1:02:40.858
Aye.

1:02:41.158 --> 1:02:43.961
And yet somehow there always seems to be

1:02:44.027 --> 1:02:46.230
such a long way to go,
Mr. Christie.

1:02:46.897 --> 1:02:48.198
Hmm.

1:02:48.499 --> 1:02:50.067
More Whisky, Major?

1:02:50.134 --> 1:02:51.101
Mm.

1:02:51.835 --> 1:02:53.103
Never say no.

1:03:04.414 --> 1:03:06.083
Ho-ho.

1:03:06.150 --> 1:03:09.253
Looks like the first lot
of trouble have arrived.

1:03:09.319 --> 1:03:11.488
The rest--sit--
won't be far behind us.

1:03:11.555 --> 1:03:14.124
<i>Hungry, I'm hoping.</i>

1:03:14.191 --> 1:03:16.260
Ready for a fine feast.

1:03:19.363 --> 1:03:21.365
Why'd you bring me here?

1:03:21.431 --> 1:03:24.935
You have been working hard

1:03:25.002 --> 1:03:27.137
all day, my love.

1:03:27.204 --> 1:03:28.906
Why don't we get some food

1:03:28.972 --> 1:03:31.408
inside that stomach of yours, hmm?

1:03:31.475 --> 1:03:34.278
But everyone else will be
eating, uh, in the other room.

1:03:35.946 --> 1:03:38.949
- There's more?
- Oh. Aye.

1:03:39.016 --> 1:03:40.517
<i>Uh, where's your brother gotten to?</i>

1:03:40.584 --> 1:03:42.085
<i>Uh, why?</i>

1:03:42.152 --> 1:03:43.854
<i>Uh, I thought ye only had eyes for me.</i>

1:03:44.354 --> 1:03:46.323
Two hands would be more useful.

1:03:46.823 --> 1:03:51.028
<i>To, uh, carry these plates
to the dining table.</i>

1:03:52.162 --> 1:03:54.231
<i>Only one Fergus Fraser
with only one hand.</i>

1:03:55.365 --> 1:03:58.001
But two's better than one,
eh, Lizzie?

1:03:59.169 --> 1:04:01.171
Oh, uh...

1:04:01.238 --> 1:04:04.007
I-I'm sure I dinna ken what ye mean.

1:04:13.083 --> 1:04:15.118
- Please help yourselves.
- Thank you.

1:04:15.185 --> 1:04:16.253
Thanks.

1:04:17.254 --> 1:04:19.523
- Can we go? Can we go?
- <i>No.</i>

1:04:19.590 --> 1:04:21.325
I dinna ken where
your next meal is coming from,

1:04:21.391 --> 1:04:23.427
- sweetheart, so--
- I'm not hungry!

1:04:23.493 --> 1:04:25.028
<i>Da would've taken me back.</i>

1:04:25.095 --> 1:04:26.029
Aidan.

1:04:26.430 --> 1:04:28.098
Come take a look at this powder horn.

1:04:28.966 --> 1:04:31.268
When you're a wee bit older,
I can teach you to, uh--

1:04:31.335 --> 1:04:33.136
My dad was a fisherman,
not a hunter.

1:04:33.203 --> 1:04:34.371
I want to go.

1:04:37.407 --> 1:04:39.009
Aidan McCallum!

1:04:39.076 --> 1:04:40.877
You come back down here this instant

1:04:40.944 --> 1:04:42.246
before anyone sees you!

1:04:43.247 --> 1:04:44.615
- Did you...
- Yeah.

1:04:44.881 --> 1:04:46.149
Yeah, I thought of something.

1:04:46.617 --> 1:04:49.019
- Do you mind if I, uh...
- No, no. Go.

1:04:49.519 --> 1:04:51.922
Here, let me.

1:04:54.091 --> 1:04:55.392
Do you mind if I sit?

1:05:02.499 --> 1:05:04.601
Why won't you have a wee bite to eat, lad?

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:07.004
Hmm?

1:05:07.437 --> 1:05:09.139
You'll need all your strength
if you want to help me

1:05:09.206 --> 1:05:12.142
build your new home, a cabin.

1:05:13.143 --> 1:05:14.645
You're the man of the house now.

1:05:14.911 --> 1:05:16.680
- I can build it with you?
- Mm-hmm.

1:05:20.450 --> 1:05:21.652
My wife and I would like to make sure

1:05:21.918 --> 1:05:23.020
that you're comfortable.

1:05:23.287 --> 1:05:25.489
<i>I'd like to supervise
work on a cabin for you.</i>

1:05:25.555 --> 1:05:27.257
<i>Everyone will help, of course.</i>

1:05:27.324 --> 1:05:29.626
But since I'm not
building one for my own family--

1:05:29.693 --> 1:05:30.961
<i>Cabin of my own?</i>

1:05:31.361 --> 1:05:33.196
I-I never expected...

1:05:34.998 --> 1:05:36.500
I could never repay ye.

1:05:38.302 --> 1:05:39.536
You won't have to.

1:06:22.412 --> 1:06:23.980
<i>Mr. Fraser.</i>

1:06:29.219 --> 1:06:30.754
Mistress Fraser.

1:06:34.591 --> 1:06:36.660
I take it this isn't a social call.

1:06:37.294 --> 1:06:38.762
No, it isn't.

1:06:40.230 --> 1:06:41.765
There's a dark-haired boy

1:06:42.399 --> 1:06:44.368
was out hunting with your Indian.

1:06:44.735 --> 1:06:45.702
Where is he?

1:06:49.005 --> 1:06:50.173
There he is.

1:06:51.375 --> 1:06:53.710
He's a thief,
and we've come to arrest him.

1:06:59.750 --> 1:07:01.518
<i>He stole a powder horn.</i>

1:07:02.085 --> 1:07:04.688
Cheeky bastard's still wearing it.

1:07:07.057 --> 1:07:09.159
And what proof do you have it isn't his?

1:07:09.226 --> 1:07:10.594
<i>Carved his initials on it--</i>

1:07:11.128 --> 1:07:13.096
for Phineas Brown, there.

1:07:15.232 --> 1:07:17.267
My man says he took it.

1:07:18.135 --> 1:07:19.269
<i>You do this, son?</i>

1:07:24.808 --> 1:07:26.777
Where did you get that powder horn?

1:07:28.412 --> 1:07:29.379
Hmm?

1:07:29.813 --> 1:07:31.281
Do you want to end up like your mother?

1:07:33.450 --> 1:07:34.484
No.

1:07:35.118 --> 1:07:36.052
Good...

1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:39.222
'cause she's burning in the fires of hell.

1:07:40.424 --> 1:07:44.327
Remember, a thief hateth his own soul.

1:07:46.129 --> 1:07:47.397
Swear to me,

1:07:48.098 --> 1:07:49.766
before God and these men,

1:07:50.467 --> 1:07:51.701
that you did not do this.

1:07:56.807 --> 1:07:58.141
I...

1:08:03.146 --> 1:08:04.214
I can't.

1:08:09.586 --> 1:08:12.289
Apologize to Mr. Brown at once.

1:08:17.761 --> 1:08:20.130
Mr. Brown, please...

1:08:21.164 --> 1:08:22.399
this is my son.

1:08:23.467 --> 1:08:24.801
Do not take him with you.

1:08:24.868 --> 1:08:27.404
We will punish him
here and now for his sin.

1:08:29.473 --> 1:08:31.141
You have my word.

1:08:42.152 --> 1:08:43.553
Ten lashes.

1:08:46.656 --> 1:08:48.391
Then it's settled.

1:08:50.393 --> 1:08:52.128
You have the powder horn back.

1:08:53.330 --> 1:08:54.531
<i>No harm was done.</i>

1:08:55.732 --> 1:08:57.767
I'll remind you all this is my land.

1:08:58.535 --> 1:09:00.704
I'll see to it the lad learns his lesson.

1:09:00.770 --> 1:09:03.707
My son will be punished,
Mr. Fraser!

1:09:03.773 --> 1:09:06.243
We'll see to that together,
Mr. Christie.

1:09:08.745 --> 1:09:11.147
Thank you for bringing this matter

1:09:11.214 --> 1:09:13.149
to my attention, Mr. Brown.

1:09:25.428 --> 1:09:29.866
Funny how it's
gunpowder he stole, eh, Mr. Fraser?

1:09:30.367 --> 1:09:31.801
Got me wondering.

1:09:32.669 --> 1:09:35.872
That's a dangerous
commodity in these dark times.

1:09:37.374 --> 1:09:39.509
Damn contentious one too.

1:09:41.311 --> 1:09:43.513
You're not harboring one of those rebels,

1:09:43.580 --> 1:09:45.415
are you, Mr. Fraser?

1:09:46.216 --> 1:09:49.219
Maybe that's why
you want to go so easy on him?

1:09:50.186 --> 1:09:53.924
What do you think,
Major MacDonald?

1:09:54.190 --> 1:09:57.427
<i>If my son had
a bone of treachery in his body,</i>

1:09:57.494 --> 1:09:59.496
I'd beat it out of him myself.

1:10:00.597 --> 1:10:02.732
We're loyal to our king.

1:10:08.271 --> 1:10:10.640
Mr. Fraser should give the punishment.

1:10:10.707 --> 1:10:12.676
<i>And we should set a good example...</i>

1:10:13.977 --> 1:10:16.880
to the loyal residents of Fraser's Ridge.

1:10:20.850 --> 1:10:21.918
<i>My land...</i>

1:10:25.755 --> 1:10:27.390
...my means.

1:10:34.698 --> 1:10:36.366
Come on, lad.

1:10:39.469 --> 1:10:40.837
Take off your jacket.

1:11:45.835 --> 1:11:47.937
Now take yer men off my land.

1:11:49.439 --> 1:11:50.674
Colonel.

1:12:15.065 --> 1:12:16.433
I'll do it.

1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:19.335
If it's between me and him,

1:12:20.403 --> 1:12:21.905
I canna let him do it.

1:12:23.540 --> 1:12:25.575
I'll be your Indian agent.

1:12:36.820 --> 1:12:38.121
<i>Mr. Christie?</i>

1:12:39.556 --> 1:12:41.558
A word, if I may.

1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:46.362
What happened with
Allan and Richard Brown...

1:12:46.429 --> 1:12:47.831
Yes.

1:12:47.897 --> 1:12:49.833
Not how I imagined
the beginning of our time

1:12:49.899 --> 1:12:51.534
at the Ridge, I must confess.

1:12:51.601 --> 1:12:53.069
And not how I imagined it either.

1:12:53.903 --> 1:12:55.438
You invited me here.

1:12:56.606 --> 1:12:58.074
And I'm grateful to have come.

1:12:59.943 --> 1:13:00.844
I did.

1:13:01.578 --> 1:13:05.081
At Ardsmuir, we got by...

1:13:06.883 --> 1:13:08.985
...lived under someone else's command.

1:13:13.123 --> 1:13:14.424
That was then.

1:13:14.791 --> 1:13:15.959
This is now.

1:13:16.626 --> 1:13:20.864
If you're to stay, then my
word at Fraser's Ridge is law.

1:13:20.930 --> 1:13:22.766
God's word is law.

1:13:23.466 --> 1:13:26.169
We put Him first,
do we not, Mr. Fraser?

1:13:27.137 --> 1:13:29.706
"Thou shalt have no other gods before Me."

1:13:31.641 --> 1:13:33.543
You should see to your son.

1:14:24.561 --> 1:14:25.895
There it is...

1:14:26.696 --> 1:14:27.797
that look...

1:14:29.532 --> 1:14:31.668
the same look
you gave me at the gathering.

1:14:35.638 --> 1:14:37.907
Your drunkenness
embarrassed me in front of everyone.

1:14:37.974 --> 1:14:40.677
A man needs a drink now and then.

1:14:45.481 --> 1:14:47.750
Your drink is
keeping you from your family...

1:14:49.886 --> 1:14:51.187
...from being a husband.

1:14:51.254 --> 1:14:53.156
Is your husband not sitting here

1:14:53.223 --> 1:14:55.258
in front of you this very moment?

1:14:57.227 --> 1:14:58.161
Is he?

1:15:15.812 --> 1:15:17.981
I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment.

1:15:30.927 --> 1:15:34.030
<i>Aren't you
the clever one, Dr. Rawlings?</i>

1:15:34.097 --> 1:15:36.833
<i>Now you're gonna repent for your sins.</i>

1:15:36.900 --> 1:15:38.001
<i>A vile succubus!</i>

1:15:38.067 --> 1:15:39.535
<i>You can come out now, Claire.</i>

1:15:39.602 --> 1:15:40.069
<i>Bitch!</i>

1:15:40.737 --> 1:15:41.704
<i>You say I'm a witch.</i>

1:15:41.771 --> 1:15:42.972
<i>I will slit her throat.</i>

1:15:43.039 --> 1:15:44.073
Pleasure to see you.

1:15:44.140 --> 1:15:46.042
<i>I suspect you may be
an English spy.</i>

1:15:46.109 --> 1:15:47.110
<i>Aren't you the clever one?</i>

1:15:50.179 --> 1:15:53.616
Sassenach, what is it?

1:15:53.683 --> 1:15:55.218
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

1:15:56.152 --> 1:15:57.854
It's fine.

1:15:57.921 --> 1:15:59.322
Go back to sleep.

1:15:59.589 --> 1:16:01.557
Is it the Browns? Did they...

1:16:01.624 --> 1:16:03.192
unsettle ye?

1:16:05.161 --> 1:16:09.165
I just want a cup of tea...

1:16:09.232 --> 1:16:11.301
...if I can find any.

1:16:11.567 --> 1:16:13.102
Bloody taxes.

1:17:29.379 --> 1:17:31.881
<i>I've never been afraid of ghosts.</i>

1:17:32.849 --> 1:17:35.118
<i>I live with them daily.</i>

1:17:35.184 --> 1:17:37.420
<i>When I look into a mirror,</i>

1:17:37.687 --> 1:17:40.123
<i>my mother's eyes look back at me.</i>

1:17:40.189 --> 1:17:42.125
<i>My mouth curls with the smile</i>

1:17:42.191 --> 1:17:43.960
<i>that lured my great-grandfather</i>

1:17:44.027 --> 1:17:45.661
<i>to the fate that was me.</i>

1:17:51.134 --> 1:17:54.370
<i>Of course,
it isn't these homely ghosts</i>

1:17:54.437 --> 1:17:57.974
<i>that trouble sleep and curdle wakefulness.</i>

1:17:58.041 --> 1:17:59.842
<i>Look back.</i>

1:17:59.909 --> 1:18:03.346
<i>Hold a torch to light
the recesses of the dark.</i>

1:18:03.413 --> 1:18:05.415
<i>Listen to the footsteps</i>

1:18:05.681 --> 1:18:08.084
<i>that echo behind when you walk alone.</i>

1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:28.771
<i>All the time, ghosts
flit past and through us,</i>

1:18:28.838 --> 1:18:30.706
<i>hiding in the future.</i>

1:18:30.773 --> 1:18:32.475
<i>Each ghost comes unbidden</i>

1:18:32.742 --> 1:18:36.145
<i>from the misty
grounds of dreams and silence.</i>

1:18:39.115 --> 1:18:43.119
<i>Our rational minds say,
"No, it isn't."</i>

1:18:43.453 --> 1:18:47.256
<i>But another part,
an older part,</i>

1:18:47.323 --> 1:18:50.059
<i>echoes always softly in the dark,</i>

1:18:50.126 --> 1:18:53.463
<i>"Yes, but it could be."</i>

1:19:13.850 --> 1:19:16.452
<i>By blood and by choice,</i>

1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:20.022
<i>we make our ghosts.</i>

1:19:20.089 --> 1:19:22.191
<i>We haunt ourselves.</i>
