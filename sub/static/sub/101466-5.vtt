Okay, let's get back to

14:20.917 --> 14:23.667
The rigid transformation
of the plane.

14:23.750 --> 14:27.291

rigid when it doesn't modify

14:27.375 --> 14:30.500

and the angle width.

It's a transformation that

There are four
types of isometry,

what they are?

-Female Student: Rotation?

14:39.999 --> 14:41.375

Translation, yes.

14:41.458 --> 14:44.333
In this case,
if we draw a quadrangle,

14:44.416 --> 14:46.375
it could be a trapezoid.

14:46.458 --> 14:49.541
We could drag our
trapezoid by its vertex A,

16:32.375 --> 16:35.625

the Carabinieri got there.

17:26.124 --> 17:27.708
-and says, "Give me room 514."
-Right.

17:27.792 --> 17:28.750

17:28.833 --> 17:30.667

"Patrice," she says, "it's me.
I'm up here with a friend.

17:32.792 --> 17:34.416
I could use a little help.
Could you help me out?"

17:34.500 --> 17:36.208
So wait. So, I don't
know what the shot is.

The chick on the other end

17:46.958 --> 17:48.875

Every once in a while,

17:48.958 --> 17:51.208

And the broad on the bed
starts going crazy.

17:51.291 --> 17:52.875
Moaning and groaning,
she's about to go

17:52.958 --> 17:54.875

Red Dog Squadron!"

leans on the bed,

18:01.291 --> 18:03.500
-pulls out this
five-gallon jerrycan.
-Right.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.583
Opens it up.
It's full of gasoline.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.583
So, she splashes the mother
all over the walls,

18:06.667 --> 18:08.625
whips a fucking Zippo out
the flak suit, and whoosh!

18:09.500 --> 18:11.792
The whole room is up in flames.
So the whole fuckin' joint

18:11.875 --> 18:13.958
is going up in smoke,
the telephone's
going rat-a-tat-tat.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.708
The broad jumps back
on the bed and yells,

18:15.792 --> 18:18.500
"Now, give it to me!
Give it to me,
for the love of Christ!"

18:21.999 --> 18:23.958
I figure this broad is crazy.

18:24.041 --> 18:25.792
I'm in the hall,

"Off we go into
the wild blue yonder!"

18:30.625 --> 18:31.917
The elevator arrives,

you know?

53:00.792 --> 53:02.208
And then what happened?

53:02.750 --> 53:04.999
I was in Tel Aviv
with my mother.

53:05.083 --> 53:08.124
It was me and her,
always me and her.

53:08.708 --> 53:10.792
I was suffocating.

53:10.875 --> 53:13.375
And so, when I was 15,
I said to her,

53:13.458 --> 53:16.667
"Dear Mom, I'm going to live
with my father in Detroit."

53:16.750 --> 53:18.999
Detroit seemed right
for a musician, right?

53:19.083 --> 53:22.333
-And then what'd she say?
-She didn't speak
with me for five years.

53:22.416 --> 53:24.041
She was a hippie.

53:24.124 --> 53:27.375
I just thought she
didn't care. She said,

53:27.458 --> 53:30.458
"No one can really keep
anyone from doing anything.

53:30.541 --> 53:33.541
You go, but your father
is a piece of shit."

53:33.625 --> 53:35.958
So, I went to
live in Detroit.

53:36.999 --> 53:38.750
And it turns out,
she was right.

53:38.833 --> 53:40.583
My father was
a piece of shit.

53:40.667 --> 53:43.875
He had another family.
I was just getting in his way,

53:43.958 --> 53:47.083
but he gave me the best
part of him: a passport.

53:47.166 --> 53:49.208
At the age of 18,
I enlisted because the guy

53:49.291 --> 53:51.583
at the recruiting stand
just wouldn't give up,

53:51.667 --> 53:54.458
and all I wanted was never
to have a home again.

53:56.124 --> 53:59.041
-I don't know a fuckin'
thing about my father.
-These days,
