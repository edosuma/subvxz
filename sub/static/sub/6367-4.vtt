<i>I didn't think you'd come.</i>

00:37.126 --> 00:39.597
<i>How are you?</i>

00:43.231 --> 00:45.501
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

00:45.534 --> 00:48.299
- What about you?
- I don't know.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.802
I'm gonna need some time, okay?

00:57.181 --> 00:59.685
I'm ready to tell you everything.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.990
<i>Mm-mmm.</i>

01:51.279 --> 01:53.384
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

02:03.963 --> 02:05.394
<i>Where's Gordon?</i>

02:05.427 --> 02:08.804
<i>I don't know. Where's Ana?</i>

02:19.880 --> 02:21.815
<i>Yeah, Mom, where's Ana?</i>

02:41.050 --> 02:45.047
<i> Morning, ladies.
5:00 A.M.</i>

02:45.088 --> 02:47.853
<i>Time to get your fingers
out of your happy hole</i>

02:47.886 --> 02:49.749
and give God the glory.

04:16.458 --> 04:19.250
<b>2x04 - "Bloodlines"</b>

04:25.153 --> 04:28.237
<i><font color="red"> sync & correction by f1nc0

05:12.690 --> 05:15.654
You know, we've never
been formally introduced.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.794
- Lucas Hood.
- Nola.

05:19.827 --> 05:21.930
Yeah, the Chief's prodigal daughter.

05:23.204 --> 05:25.973
I asked around. Small town.

05:27.438 --> 05:29.972
<i>Heard you arrested Tommy Littlestone.</i>

05:30.005 --> 05:33.011
We questioned him.
He's not a killer.

05:33.044 --> 05:36.576
<i>And you've got Chayton locked up?</i>

05:36.609 --> 05:38.345
That must have taken some doing.

05:38.378 --> 05:41.650
- He a friend of yours?
- No.

05:41.683 --> 05:43.619
But he didn't do it either.

05:43.652 --> 05:47.139
<i>Chayton is a killer,
but he's also a purist.</i>

05:47.140 --> 05:49.163
<i>He would never kill a Kinaho girl.</i>

05:50.196 --> 05:53.900
- You can't know that.
- Call it an expert opinion.

05:53.934 --> 05:58.374
Okay. So in your expert opinion,
where should I be looking?

05:58.407 --> 06:00.207
Are you seriously asking me that?

06:00.240 --> 06:03.680
I mean, isn't that where
you'd be the expert?

06:15.162 --> 06:18.026
- He behaving?
- Yeah, so far.

06:18.067 --> 06:20.002
<i>Hey, black man.</i>

06:21.235 --> 06:23.539
You're a disgrace to your race.

06:25.172 --> 06:27.807
<i>They tore your ancestors
from their land,</i>

06:27.840 --> 06:31.575
raped their women, and enslaved
your people for generations.

06:31.608 --> 06:35.081
And now you wear their uniform.

06:35.114 --> 06:37.385
Where's your dignity?

06:37.418 --> 06:40.121
<i>How do you live with yourself?</i>

06:42.219 --> 06:44.793
By getting scum like you
off the streets.

06:44.858 --> 06:46.761
I live with myself just fine.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.362
You get anything from the state police?

06:51.395 --> 06:53.331
They searched the woods, came up empty.

06:53.364 --> 06:56.972
Okay.
We should press the Bowmans.

06:57.005 --> 06:58.910
Okay. They might know
more than they're saying.

06:58.943 --> 07:00.541
- Right.
- Or...

07:00.575 --> 07:03.614
Or what?
We should talk to the kids.

07:03.647 --> 07:06.486
If Solomon is hiding, one of
his buddies might know where.

07:06.519 --> 07:08.420
- Great.
- Yeah, and I should talk to them.

07:09.652 --> 07:12.251
Alone.

07:12.284 --> 07:15.289
Look, Hood,

07:15.322 --> 07:17.754
it's hard enough to get the
Amish adults to talk to us,

07:17.795 --> 07:22.385
but the kids, kids are off-limits.
And your... style,

07:23.330 --> 07:25.760
<i>well, it won't work with them.</i>

07:27.033 --> 07:28.433
But they'll talk to you?

07:28.466 --> 07:30.074
I've always had good
relations with the elders.

07:30.139 --> 07:32.041
They trust me.

07:33.338 --> 07:36.440
Okay.
Let me know what turns up.

07:41.488 --> 07:43.657
You were looking for me?

07:43.690 --> 07:46.119
You went a little overboard
on this room, don't you think?

07:47.824 --> 07:50.360
<i>Proctor is one man.</i>

07:50.393 --> 07:54.202
<i>You are the head of the
entire Kinaho Nation.</i>

07:54.235 --> 07:58.304
<i>It doesn't matter if you are
weak or you just appear weak.</i>

07:58.337 --> 08:00.006
There's blood in the water.

08:00.039 --> 08:03.070
And men like Proctor
and Hunter can smell it.

08:03.103 --> 08:05.878
I'm the Chief of this tribe, Nola.

08:05.911 --> 08:09.311
I don't have the luxury of being able
to take out anyone who challenges me.

08:09.344 --> 08:11.512
Isn't that why you keep me around?

08:15.092 --> 08:17.258
Get your feet off the table.

08:40.388 --> 08:42.722
<i>You've reached the voice
mailbox of Gordon Hopewell.</i>

08:42.756 --> 08:44.793
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

08:44.826 --> 08:49.866
Gordon.
It's me, again.

08:49.899 --> 08:54.370
<i>I know you don't want to talk to me
and I understand that. I do.</i>

08:54.403 --> 08:57.610
- Good morning.
- Morning.

08:57.644 --> 09:01.845
- Hey, where you going?
- Out.

09:01.878 --> 09:04.685
<i> Last night I dreamt
that we were a family again.</i>

09:04.718 --> 09:07.391
I know it was just a dream,
but I've got to believe

09:07.424 --> 09:10.022
that if I could find the
right words to say to you,

09:10.055 --> 09:12.865
<i>you would find a way to forgive me.</i>

09:12.898 --> 09:16.370
<i>I can survive this place.</i>

09:16.403 --> 09:20.339
I can't live without you and the kids.
I won't survive that.

09:20.372 --> 09:22.242
<i>Please tell the kids that I love them.</i>

09:22.275 --> 09:25.841
<i>That much at least
I hope you know is true.</i>

09:30.721 --> 09:33.427
Oh, dude, I heard this Indian chick

09:33.460 --> 09:35.699
<i>had, like, the whole back
of her head busted in.</i>

09:35.732 --> 09:38.564
<i>Do you mean like "scalped"?</i>

09:38.597 --> 09:41.670
<i>Oh, my God.
That is so messed up.</i>

09:41.703 --> 09:43.374
<i>Oh, shit, the cops.</i>

10:11.643 --> 10:14.244
<i>- Hey.
- Sleep well?</i>

10:15.549 --> 10:18.013
- Okay, what the fuck?
- Right back at you.

10:18.054 --> 10:19.821
Hey, man, I don't know what
kind of kinky shit you're into...

10:19.854 --> 10:21.884
Get up and brush your hair.

10:21.917 --> 10:25.588
- Job's here to take your picture.
- I am?

10:25.621 --> 10:29.493
Okay, who the fuck is this
and what the hell am I doing here?

10:29.526 --> 10:32.230
Well, this is where it gets interesting.

10:32.263 --> 10:34.302
Introduce yourself.

10:35.271 --> 10:36.871
Jason Hood.

10:38.705 --> 10:41.309
- Fuck me.
- Yeah.

10:41.343 --> 10:43.341
We got to make him someone else.

10:43.374 --> 10:45.710
Well, the motherfucking hits
just keep on coming.

10:45.743 --> 10:48.782
- Nice tie.
- Shut up. And why aren't we killing him?

10:48.815 --> 10:50.485
- Hey, whoa.
- Shut up.

10:55.485 --> 11:00.189
- Proctor?
- Morning, Chief.

11:00.230 --> 11:04.227
- Paul Moon needed six surgeries.
- I'm sorry, Paul Moon?

11:04.260 --> 11:05.860
The man whose balls you crushed.

11:05.900 --> 11:08.301
Ah, I never caught his name.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.903
You came to my home,
you violated my privacy...

11:11.944 --> 11:13.511
You kidnapped my niece.

11:13.544 --> 11:16.143
Yeah, we can stand here and
trade accusations all day.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.216
The bottom line is
your own people have lost faith in you.

11:19.249 --> 11:21.153
<i>And you have no one else
to blame but yourself.</i>

11:21.186 --> 11:23.668
Hey, Alex. How are you?
What can I get you?

11:23.669 --> 11:26.649
You're a thug, Proctor.
And when you go down,

11:26.650 --> 11:29.630
and you will go down...
no one's gonna miss you.

11:29.663 --> 11:31.200
I'm gonna come back later.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.441
You know what, Alex?

11:33.474 --> 11:36.043
You care too much about
what people think of you.

11:36.076 --> 11:38.413
You'll never achieve
any power like that.

11:38.446 --> 11:40.782
Lie, cheat, extort...
and you call that power?

11:40.816 --> 11:44.358
That's not power, that's
just being a sociopath.

11:44.391 --> 11:47.558
I'm running a business.
You're running a tribe.

11:47.591 --> 11:49.756
The difference is I've earned my spot.

11:49.789 --> 11:52.525
- You're a criminal.
- That's just semantics.

11:52.565 --> 11:54.334
"Semantics."

11:55.536 --> 11:57.401
You're operating out of fear.

11:57.434 --> 12:01.178
Fear of losing your position.
Fear of the consequences.

12:01.211 --> 12:04.115
<i>I'm not always the
smartest guy in the room,</i>

12:04.148 --> 12:05.851
but I'm fearless.

12:05.884 --> 12:08.387
I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to get what I want.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.682
And because of that, people fear me.

12:10.723 --> 12:12.988
Now, unless you can do that,

12:13.022 --> 12:15.662
your tribe will smell
the weakness on you

12:15.694 --> 12:18.091
<i>and the stronger ones
will take you down.</i>

12:19.133 --> 12:22.164
That's a great speech.
Thank you.

12:22.197 --> 12:24.129
But I'm not scared of you.

12:24.162 --> 12:26.434
I'm not really
getting through to you, am I?

12:26.467 --> 12:29.571
This is my fault. I may have
come on too strong with you.

12:29.605 --> 12:33.443
And now you feel that anything
other than war is backing down.

12:33.476 --> 12:37.346
You know, we could have been
great partners, you and I, Alex.

12:37.379 --> 12:38.913
With the casino and all.

12:38.946 --> 12:43.585
Sometimes it takes more strength
to make peace than to fight.

12:43.618 --> 12:45.290
Something your father taught me,

12:45.323 --> 12:47.657
<i>God rest his soul.</i>

12:49.560 --> 12:53.296
You were just a tool to my father.

12:53.329 --> 12:55.252
He thought you were garbage.

12:56.298 --> 12:59.633
Why don't you go back
to the reservation, Alex?

12:59.666 --> 13:01.568
There, at least, you are something.

13:01.601 --> 13:04.334
In the meantime, I have more
important things to deal with.

13:04.367 --> 13:08.404
Don't worry.
We'll find your nephew.

13:12.614 --> 13:16.645
If anyone from your
tribe touches that boy,

13:16.687 --> 13:20.887
I'll hold you
personally responsible.

13:23.424 --> 13:25.456
<i>Maybe I should talk to your sister.</i>

13:25.497 --> 13:27.924
<i>Seems to me she's the
one with the balls anyway.</i>

13:40.365 --> 13:42.869
I should slit your throat right here.

13:42.902 --> 13:45.671
Yeah?
Now that would take some balls.

13:45.703 --> 13:48.174
Mr. Proctor, Alex,
do I need to call the BSD?

13:48.207 --> 13:50.645
<i>I have them on speed dial.</i>

13:55.751 --> 13:58.749
That's okay, Daria.
Sorry, just a small disagreement.

14:00.117 --> 14:03.989
Here, that should cover that.
I'm sorry, Daria.

14:06.393 --> 14:08.700
<i>Here's the rest of
the Kinaho statements.</i>

14:08.765 --> 14:10.869
<i>Thanks.</i>

14:14.005 --> 14:18.402
- About last night...
- Oh, it's all good, boss.

14:20.844 --> 14:23.148
<i>Hey, Hood, I...</i>

14:24.182 --> 14:25.886
- You got a minute?
- Yeah.

14:28.726 --> 14:30.356
<i>What?</i>

14:30.389 --> 14:34.246
This may be nothing, but one
of the Amish boys just told me

14:34.247 --> 14:38.103
that Solomon had a friend named
Daniel Moses who left the fold.

14:38.136 --> 14:39.768
Guess he was a bit of a problem child.

14:39.801 --> 14:42.007
He ran away a few times.
They kept dragging him back.

14:42.041 --> 14:44.208
But the last time he ran, he was 18,
so they just let him go.

14:44.241 --> 14:45.777
<i>- You know where he lives?
- Yeah.</i>

14:45.810 --> 14:47.979
Kid said he's squatting in
a building over on Delafield.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.146
- Let's go.
- All right.

14:58.724 --> 15:00.828
<i>What the fuck?!</i>

15:06.366 --> 15:09.868
Were you or were you not supposed
to stay in your motherfucking room?

15:09.941 --> 15:13.446
- I got hungry.
- Get in the fucking car.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.175
I kind of don't want to.

15:17.249 --> 15:20.014
Bitch, I should be shooting
your dumb white ass right now,

15:20.047 --> 15:21.919
but instead I'm offering you a ride.

15:21.952 --> 15:25.486
So show some fucking gratitude
and get in the fucking car

15:25.559 --> 15:29.187
or I will run you into a wall and
say my foot slipped off the clutch!

15:57.650 --> 15:59.890
<i>Daniel Moses?</i>

16:01.587 --> 16:03.522
<i>Oh, great.</i>

16:07.030 --> 16:09.333
<i>Hey!</i>

16:12.634 --> 16:15.431
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I'm not going back. I'm not going back!

16:17.371 --> 16:19.140
- I'm not going back!
- I'm not gonna take you back.

16:19.173 --> 16:21.277
I'm 18 years old and you
can't make me go back.

16:21.310 --> 16:22.509
<i>- Hey!
- We're not... hey!</i>

16:22.550 --> 16:24.349
God damn it!
We're not taking you back.

16:24.382 --> 16:27.252
That's not why we're here.
We're looking for Solomon Bowman.

16:27.285 --> 16:30.055
Solomon? Why?
What's wrong?

16:30.088 --> 16:31.686
<i>- You haven't heard?
- No.</i>

16:31.727 --> 16:35.127
Solomon's missing.
We know he's a friend of yours.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.231
We thought maybe he
was crashing with you.

16:37.264 --> 16:40.168
- I haven't seen him in weeks.
- Listen to me.

16:40.201 --> 16:42.233
There's other people
looking for him, okay?

16:42.274 --> 16:44.843
- If they find him before we do...
- I'm telling you the truth.

16:44.876 --> 16:47.674
If you don't believe me,
you can come check my place.

17:01.958 --> 17:04.095
<i>Fix the place up yourself?</i>

17:04.136 --> 17:06.398
Yeah.

17:07.536 --> 17:09.838
- You like to read?
- Yeah.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.701
Salinger?

17:11.742 --> 17:13.468
They don't let you read
that at the Amish school?

17:13.509 --> 17:17.209
No, they don't let us read anything.

17:17.242 --> 17:20.505
- Really?
- It's just a way to keep us trapped on the farm...

17:20.546 --> 17:25.280
ignorant, unable to
engage the outside world.

17:25.313 --> 17:28.080
So whenever I went to town,
I'd buy one or two books

17:28.114 --> 17:31.690
and hide them in the
crawlspace beneath the house.

17:31.724 --> 17:36.828
- You ever get caught?
- There was this teacher at our school.

17:36.861 --> 17:40.237
Even though we stopped going
to school after eighth grade,

17:40.270 --> 17:45.336
he was still responsible
for our religious training.

17:45.369 --> 17:47.633
<i>He caught me reading "Lord of the Flies"</i>

17:47.673 --> 17:51.476
and he just went off on me.

17:51.509 --> 17:55.577
Punching me, kicking me,
screaming like a maniac

17:55.610 --> 17:58.513
that my mind was "poisoned by filth."

18:00.956 --> 18:02.722
Patia.

18:02.755 --> 18:05.888
I heard what happened
to you. I am so sorry.

18:05.921 --> 18:08.357
- You sent me into the woods.
- I know.

18:08.390 --> 18:10.084
My Mom,
she made me come back home

18:10.125 --> 18:12.724
after what your uncle
did to those Kinaho men.

18:12.757 --> 18:14.388
Well, someone knew where to find me.

18:14.429 --> 18:16.733
I didn't tell anybody! I promise.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.165
<i>I wasn't a rebel or anything.</i>

18:20.198 --> 18:24.038
<i>I wasn't having sex or doing drugs.</i>

18:24.071 --> 18:26.205
I just wanted to read.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.007
So I ran away.

18:29.048 --> 18:32.181
Patia, what were you
going to tell me yesterday?

18:32.214 --> 18:34.844
<i> Is that normal?</i>

18:34.877 --> 18:36.811
Any other teachers hit you?

18:36.852 --> 18:41.650
No, this guy was kind of a...
religious nut.

18:41.683 --> 18:44.186
And that's saying something
considering where I'm from.

18:44.219 --> 18:46.891
<i>Solomon is missing.</i>

18:47.317 --> 18:48.854
<i>He might be dead.</i>

18:48.855 --> 18:50.268
<i>You can help him.</i>

18:50.335 --> 18:52.376
<i>But, I could be wrong.</i>

18:52.560 --> 18:56.631
Please.
Just tell me what you know.

18:56.664 --> 18:59.797
<i>He'd look for me, demanding I repent.</i>

18:59.830 --> 19:02.607
<i>Getting rough with me when I wouldn't.</i>

19:02.640 --> 19:06.669
<i>I told Solomon that if things ever
got too bad, he could come here.</i>

19:06.710 --> 19:10.004
<i>Wait, wait. So this teacher
was picking on Solomon as well?</i>

19:10.045 --> 19:13.643
Yeah, Solomon has his sister.

19:13.676 --> 19:16.745
The teacher, he's twisted.

19:16.778 --> 19:20.849
<i>- And he hates Solomon.
- Why?</i>

19:20.882 --> 19:24.357
I don't know. Maybe
because he's your brother?

19:24.390 --> 19:27.662
<i>They were worried he was
gonna go the same way.</i>

19:27.695 --> 19:30.737
Like the whole bloodline
was cursed or something.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.169
<i>Superstitious bullshit.</i>

19:33.202 --> 19:35.535
<i>Uncle...</i>

19:37.408 --> 19:39.176
<i>Then Solomon met this Indian girl.</i>

19:39.210 --> 19:43.772
He tried to keep it a secret,
but word always gets out, you know?

19:43.813 --> 19:47.778
So this teacher, what's his name?

19:47.811 --> 19:49.713
Jonah Lambrecht?

19:49.746 --> 19:52.281
- Yes.
- Sheriff Lucas Hood.

19:52.314 --> 19:56.582
- Can I come in?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

19:56.615 --> 19:59.118
It's about the boy, Solomon, right?

20:00.151 --> 20:02.355
That's right.

20:04.250 --> 20:09.020
Please, have a seat.
I'll cook up some water.

20:14.493 --> 20:16.959
It's terrible about the girl.

20:20.556 --> 20:25.163
- How can I be of help?
- You live alone?

20:26.596 --> 20:31.465
- Yes, I know it's a bit messy.
- No, no. It's not that.

20:31.498 --> 20:36.997
I just didn't realize
there was Amish bachelors.

20:37.030 --> 20:42.262
My wife Sara died
a few years after we were married.

20:42.295 --> 20:45.635
I'm sorry.
You have any kids?

20:46.731 --> 20:51.332
No.
She'd always been a frail woman.

20:51.766 --> 20:56.501
Couldn't have any children.
But I loved her very much.

20:56.534 --> 21:01.244
- So you never remarried?
- No. When she died, I just...

21:01.277 --> 21:07.406
I don't know.
I lost interest in getting married.

21:07.471 --> 21:11.246
Once you've loved someone
a certain way,

21:11.279 --> 21:15.780
you... you know you'll never
love another like that.

21:21.085 --> 21:23.052
So tell me about Solomon.

21:23.085 --> 21:27.193
- He was your student, right?
- Yes.

21:27.226 --> 21:31.564
A few years ago.
He's a bright boy.

21:31.597 --> 21:36.297
Maybe a bit rebellious,
but a sweet boy.

21:37.738 --> 21:40.105
I don't think for one minute
that he hurt that girl.

21:40.138 --> 21:45.980
- What do you mean "rebellious"?
- Well, Solomon was curious.

21:47.645 --> 21:51.115
He couldn't always accept
the restrictions of our faith.

21:51.148 --> 21:55.956
It's a big world out there
and boys will be curious.

21:57.021 --> 22:00.592
I know I was.

22:00.626 --> 22:03.894
So, what, it was your job
to bring him back into line?

22:05.159 --> 22:07.528
No, no, no.
That falls to the parents.

22:07.561 --> 22:11.232
I'm simply there to teach
them the precepts of our faith.

22:11.265 --> 22:15.838
And as a part of this teaching,
you ever get physical with them?

22:15.872 --> 22:19.575
- I'm sorry?
- You ever hit them?

22:19.640 --> 22:22.075
- No.
- No?

22:22.108 --> 22:23.970
Of course not.

22:24.011 --> 22:27.074
We do not believe in
violence of any kind.

22:27.107 --> 22:29.099
Oh.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.881
'Cause that's not what
Daniel Moses told me.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.594
<i>Yes.</i>

22:42.563 --> 22:45.130
That was a mistake.

22:45.163 --> 22:46.883
<i>I think about Daniel a lot.</i>

22:47.395 --> 22:51.268
At the time, I told
myself it was self-defense.

22:52.541 --> 22:55.202
After all, it was he who attacked me.

22:55.243 --> 22:58.137
But I would do anything
to see that boy again.

22:59.242 --> 23:02.478
To tell him how sorry I am.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.880
To ask him to forgive me, and...

23:08.153 --> 23:10.349
to ask him to come home.

23:13.751 --> 23:15.885
Excuse me.

23:18.662 --> 23:20.796
You hurt your leg?

23:20.829 --> 23:24.256
It's an old injury.
I got kicked by a horse.

23:24.289 --> 23:26.790
So why is it still bleeding?

23:34.700 --> 23:38.835
What happened to no violence, Jonah?
You're under arrest.

23:38.868 --> 23:41.002
You have the right to remain silent...

24:29.669 --> 24:32.774
Where's the boy?
Where's the boy?!

24:37.954 --> 24:40.218
Where's the boy!

24:42.721 --> 24:43.992
Where is he?

24:51.731 --> 24:54.096
He's not gonna tell you.

24:54.635 --> 24:57.811
His psychotic belief in his
own righteousness is too strong.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.381
So what do you suggest?

25:05.854 --> 25:08.651
Just leave us alone for a bit.

25:11.621 --> 25:14.029
<i>You know, I'm finding
everybody's reaction</i>

25:14.062 --> 25:16.996
to this kid disturbingly underreactive.

25:17.029 --> 25:20.030
We should be digging
a motherfucking hole.

25:20.071 --> 25:23.773
Look, he's just a kid
looking for a second chance.

25:23.806 --> 25:27.037
And when did we become
"Touched by an Angel"?

25:27.070 --> 25:30.941
<i>- It is strange, though.
- What's that?</i>

25:30.974 --> 25:34.147
Well, of all the chairs
he could have chosen,

25:34.180 --> 25:38.250
he chose the same chair his
father chose the day he got killed.

25:38.283 --> 25:41.555
- So, Job.
- "Job"?

25:41.588 --> 25:43.387
When do you think my
fake ID will be ready?

25:45.556 --> 25:47.555
Fake ID, hmm?

25:48.628 --> 25:50.532
Bitch, what you think this is?

25:50.565 --> 25:52.967
This ain't some phony
Virginia driver's license

25:53.000 --> 25:55.136
you're buying for 50 bucks
in the back of a head shop

25:55.169 --> 25:57.336
so you can host
a kegger in your backyard

25:57.409 --> 25:59.843
and date-rape the
motherfucking prom queen.

25:59.877 --> 26:01.718
I'm giving you a new name,
credit history,

26:01.751 --> 26:05.317
<i>Social Security number
and a motherfucking birth certificate.</i>

26:05.357 --> 26:08.919
I am turning you into
a whole new goddamn human being.

26:08.952 --> 26:13.489
- Okay. Jesus, I'm sorry.
- And let me tell you something else.

26:13.522 --> 26:16.957
Once I have performed
this little miracle,

26:16.990 --> 26:19.325
you are going to disappear

26:19.358 --> 26:22.334
and we are not going to see or
hear from your punk ass again

26:22.367 --> 26:24.501
because if you show up a second time

26:24.534 --> 26:26.565
looking for a handout
because you fucked up again,

26:26.598 --> 26:28.766
I will personally put
a bullet between your eyes.

26:30.407 --> 26:33.637
And just for that,
I'm gonna name you Marion.

26:41.516 --> 26:43.515
Now, you may not be aware, Jonah...

26:45.282 --> 26:48.352
but there is a debate currently
raging in civil society

26:48.385 --> 26:50.655
about the efficacy of torture.

26:51.921 --> 26:54.191
Now, I happen to fall
on the side of those

26:54.224 --> 26:56.494
who believe that pain is a tool...

26:58.392 --> 27:00.496
...like any other.

27:03.093 --> 27:07.467
And where pain will work...

27:12.139 --> 27:14.840
it's far and away the most
efficient tool for the job.

27:26.816 --> 27:29.215
Just tap your foot when
you're ready to talk.

28:09.890 --> 28:12.624
There's an unused silo
on the adjacent property.

28:12.657 --> 28:15.319
He's got Solomon locked away.

28:16.658 --> 28:20.329
Oh, it took me a few
extra teeth to get this.

28:25.803 --> 28:28.373
Fuck that. Let's drive.

28:29.874 --> 28:32.303
- You kill him?
- No.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.744
But you should probably
call an ambulance.

28:37.376 --> 28:39.580
Yeah, I probably should.

28:45.319 --> 28:47.286
Solomon?

28:58.236 --> 29:00.770
<i>God damn it. Hey.</i>

29:11.285 --> 29:12.820
Shit.

29:34.072 --> 29:36.038
<i>- I found him.
- Oh, God.</i>

29:36.071 --> 29:39.205
Solomon. Hey, Solomon.

29:39.238 --> 29:42.772
- Solomon. Solomon.
- Hey. Hey.

29:45.781 --> 29:49.251
<i>Solomon.
It's okay.</i>

29:55.718 --> 29:59.680
I got you. I got you.
Okay.

30:08.889 --> 30:10.854
I love you. It's okay.

30:10.887 --> 30:12.958
<i>It's okay.</i>

30:16.771 --> 30:18.602
<i>It's okay.</i>

31:02.734 --> 31:06.140
<i>I love you. It's okay.</i>

31:07.405 --> 31:09.404
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

31:16.782 --> 31:18.885
<i>Solomon!</i>

31:23.255 --> 31:25.326
Oh. Oh.

31:46.448 --> 31:48.416
When your own grandson was lost,

31:48.449 --> 31:51.727
you cowered and prayed to God,
and the Almighty

31:51.785 --> 31:54.426
<i>would have left him
dead beneath your feet.</i>

31:54.459 --> 31:56.828
<i>Well, maybe God just doesn't love you</i>

31:56.861 --> 31:58.700
<i>as much as you'd like to believe.</i>

31:58.733 --> 32:00.331
<i>Maybe He finds it laughably arrogant</i>

32:00.364 --> 32:02.773
<i>for you to think you even know His will.</i>

32:02.806 --> 32:05.238
God brought him back to us.

32:05.271 --> 32:08.474
Yeah, you go and see what
I did to Jonah Lambrecht.

32:08.507 --> 32:11.181
You'll see that God had
nothing to do with it.

32:12.079 --> 32:15.684
<i>- Nothing.
- Let's go.</i>

32:30.031 --> 32:32.165
You're gonna be okay.

33:03.211 --> 33:07.847
<i>All right.
Here's the paperwork on him.</i>

33:07.880 --> 33:09.648
<i>It's two hours to Jefferson County.</i>

33:09.681 --> 33:11.353
<i>Sheriff's Department will
meet you at the county line.</i>

33:11.386 --> 33:13.722
<i>All right. See you later.</i>

33:14.955 --> 33:17.331
<i>Christ, he's a big one.
Stay alert, huh?</i>

33:17.364 --> 33:19.997
<i>We will.</i>

34:12.252 --> 34:13.754
Hey, what the fuck?!

34:13.786 --> 34:17.150
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

34:17.184 --> 34:19.658
Hey, cut that shit out now!

34:19.690 --> 34:22.393
<i>Hey, you want to fucking
get tased again? Stop!</i>

34:25.931 --> 34:27.601
Stop it right now!

34:27.634 --> 34:29.571
<i>This is Deputy Yawners with the BSD.</i>

34:29.603 --> 34:32.175
<i>Shit. Stop that.
You want me to shoot you?</i>

34:56.792 --> 34:59.160
<i>It's happy green.
It makes you happy.</i>

34:59.193 --> 35:02.400
- Flynn, where did you get this stuff?
- Actually, I can't tell you.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.432
Come on, Deva.
Please, baby, pick up.

35:07.802 --> 35:09.768
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

35:09.808 --> 35:11.070
<i>Whoa.</i>

35:11.103 --> 35:12.670
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

35:12.703 --> 35:14.712
<i>- It's amazing, right?
- Watch this.</i>

35:14.745 --> 35:17.313
<i>Hey, it's Deva. Leave a message.</i>

35:17.346 --> 35:21.118
<i>Or don't. Bye.</i>

35:21.151 --> 35:22.951
Hi, Deva. It's Mom.

35:24.385 --> 35:28.054
<i>I don't even know where to start.
I have so much to say.</i>

35:29.254 --> 35:31.453
I just want you to know that I love you.

35:32.893 --> 35:36.534
That I always have.
That part was never a lie.

35:36.567 --> 35:39.628
<i>All I ever wanted was for
you and Max to be happy</i>

35:39.669 --> 35:43.838
<i>and to feel safe.
When I come home,</i>

35:43.871 --> 35:47.343
<i>you can ask me anything
and I'll tell you the truth.</i>

35:47.376 --> 35:50.344
<i>Baby, we can find our way back.</i>

35:50.377 --> 35:54.089
Just don't give up on me.
Okay?

35:55.051 --> 35:57.122
I love you.

35:58.956 --> 36:01.427
Tell Max I love him, too.

You look so sad.

36:34.256 --> 36:36.623
You have no idea.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.667
Want some company?

36:45.171 --> 36:46.708
You know,

36:46.741 --> 36:50.412
any other night I would
tell you to get lost.

37:00.958 --> 37:05.692
- What the hell happened to him?
- He resisted arrest.

37:07.093 --> 37:08.762
Strenuously.

37:18.935 --> 37:20.303
<i>No.</i>

37:20.336 --> 37:22.104
<i>Don't do this, Father.</i>

37:22.137 --> 37:23.775
<i> You did this.</i>

37:23.808 --> 37:26.343
<i>Daddy! Mama!</i>

37:26.376 --> 37:29.540
<i>Don't let them do this to me!</i>

Did you get a confession?

37:32.845 --> 37:35.548
<i>Don't need one.
We got the boy.</i>

37:35.581 --> 37:38.022
How is the boy?

37:39.622 --> 37:42.955
He'll give you everything you
need to pin the murder on him.

37:45.060 --> 37:47.889
<i>Well, you did a number on him.</i>

37:47.930 --> 37:51.762
Congratulations, Sheriff.
Your department needed this win.

37:53.501 --> 37:54.975
Here to serve.

38:14.363 --> 38:16.364
I hope it hurts like hell.

38:23.804 --> 38:25.539
<i>You heard from Emmett or Siobhan?</i>

38:25.572 --> 38:27.042
No, why?

38:27.075 --> 38:29.870
I can't seem to get them on
their cells or on the radio.

38:33.677 --> 38:36.544
<i>You know what?
They still got another half an hour.</i>

38:38.771 --> 38:41.935
<i>- Keep trying.
- Yeah. Yeah, I will.</i>

39:03.492 --> 39:05.458
Be still.

39:22.366 --> 39:25.807
What is it with white people and chains?

39:27.039 --> 39:31.876
From the day you got here,
you've been locking people up.

39:39.990 --> 39:44.859
Tell your sheriff
I'll see him soon.

39:58.503 --> 40:00.931
Hit the dirt, cop!

40:03.435 --> 40:05.901
Get down. now!

40:07.069 --> 40:09.074
<i>Drop it.</i>

40:14.812 --> 40:17.852
Here you go, black man.
I think these are yours.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.535
<i>It's strong, yo.</i>

40:34.568 --> 40:36.373
<i> I'm bummin'.</i>

40:36.406 --> 40:38.266
<i>Look at him in that hat.</i>

40:38.299 --> 40:40.401
<i>- Oh, my God.
- It's the cops.</i>

40:40.434 --> 40:42.442
<i>- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.</i>

40:44.242 --> 40:47.239
<i>- It's fine. Just stop.
- How you doing, Officer?</i>

40:47.272 --> 40:50.313
<i>We weren't doing anything, man.</i>

40:50.346 --> 40:52.313
Your parents know you're
out here getting high?

40:52.346 --> 40:54.648
<i>Allegedly high.</i>

40:54.680 --> 40:57.455
- Go home.
- Don't have to tell me twice.

40:57.488 --> 41:00.054
<i>Now.</i>

41:00.087 --> 41:02.286
Deva.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.928
<i>Let's go, dude. Come on.</i>

41:04.961 --> 41:07.562
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

41:10.405 --> 41:12.140
<i>You guys are idiots.</i>

41:20.044 --> 41:23.053
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke pot.

41:23.086 --> 41:27.324
- Yeah, I know.
- Fair enough.

41:28.927 --> 41:31.662
You angry at your mom?

41:33.160 --> 41:37.933
- You don't know how I feel.
- No, but that's what you're doing, right?

41:39.905 --> 41:41.536
Trying to hurt her.

41:43.473 --> 41:47.113
It won't work.
Just make more mess.

41:47.146 --> 41:51.514
What makes you the expert?
Do you have any kids?

41:54.217 --> 41:55.521
No.

41:57.924 --> 41:59.859
<i>But I know how to make a mess.</i>

41:59.892 --> 42:03.163
<i> I believe it.</i>

42:03.196 --> 42:05.731
<i>There's your dad.</i>

42:13.244 --> 42:15.506
Thanks for the lemonade.

42:31.266 --> 42:34.266
So I suppose
congratulations are in order.

42:34.306 --> 42:39.042
- You're a father!
- Mm-hmm.

42:39.075 --> 42:42.513
I have to say, when it was
about the money, I got it.

42:42.546 --> 42:45.380
When it was about true love
gone tragically wrong,

42:45.413 --> 42:47.317
- I even got that.
- Yeah.

42:47.350 --> 42:50.322
But if you think you're
gonna hang around here,

42:50.355 --> 42:52.618
take a couple parenting classes,

42:52.691 --> 42:56.823
make all this evil shit right,
you are sadly mistaken.

42:58.359 --> 43:01.659
Bad shit happens to people
standing too close to you.

43:03.525 --> 43:05.893
<i>If you care for them,</i>

43:05.934 --> 43:08.597
you have to get out of their lives.

43:13.438 --> 43:15.670
Take the diamonds to New York.

43:15.711 --> 43:21.583
- Fence 'em. Get what you can.
- Say amen, somebody.

43:21.616 --> 43:26.253
- The man has come to his senses.
- Call me when you're done.

43:28.623 --> 43:31.358
I'll... come up.

43:31.391 --> 43:33.092
<i>Anywhere but here, baby.</i>

43:33.125 --> 43:35.924
<i>Anywhere on this big,
beautiful planet but here.</i>

43:40.760 --> 43:42.834
Hey.

43:43.764 --> 43:45.635
You okay?

43:45.668 --> 43:48.269
Jesus Christ! Jesus.

43:50.007 --> 43:52.815
- We got to get you checked out.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

43:52.848 --> 43:56.119
I didn't realize it was
this bad or I would have come.

43:56.152 --> 43:58.151
<i>I know.</i>

43:59.951 --> 44:02.987
For a moment,

44:03.020 --> 44:05.521
after the crash...

44:07.092 --> 44:09.492
I thought I was dead.

44:13.227 --> 44:15.933
Come on.
I'm gonna take you home.

44:15.998 --> 44:18.739
<i>Come on.</i>

44:36.425 --> 44:38.426
Here to go another round?

44:38.467 --> 44:42.001
No.
I said something to you earlier.

44:42.034 --> 44:45.571
That it takes more strength
to make peace than to fight.

44:45.604 --> 44:49.243
I think I need to learn
that lesson again myself.

44:49.276 --> 44:52.877
I hope you'll consider this
an adequate peace offering.

44:54.350 --> 44:57.516
Those are seven teeth of the
man who murdered the girl.

44:57.549 --> 45:00.085
The rest of him is in lockup in town.

45:00.118 --> 45:02.253
Why don't you make a necklace of them?

45:02.294 --> 45:05.590
Go tell your people you
brought peace on the land.

45:05.630 --> 45:09.365
I think you'll be pleased to know
he wasn't one of yours.

45:12.768 --> 45:16.104
<i>"And thine eye shall not pity,
but life shall go for life.</i>

45:16.137 --> 45:19.310
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth."

45:30.821 --> 45:32.714
This doesn't change anything, you know.

45:32.754 --> 45:37.214
I don't like Proctor any more
than you do, but he may be right.

45:37.255 --> 45:39.390
This isn't a time to fight.

45:39.423 --> 45:42.894
Alex, you will not
get into bed with Proctor.

45:42.927 --> 45:44.525
Hunter's working the council hard.

45:44.558 --> 45:46.694
I can't afford another embarrassment.

45:46.727 --> 45:48.366
You said it yourself,
there's blood in the water.

45:48.399 --> 45:50.429
Yeah, that's right.
So be the shark!

45:52.765 --> 45:55.236
Be the fucking shark, Alex!

45:56.703 --> 45:59.803
What are you gonna do, Nola?
You gonna hit me?

46:21.629 --> 46:26.498
<i>I think I was wrong
to ask you to stick around.</i>

46:26.531 --> 46:29.170
After everything that's happened,

46:29.203 --> 46:32.505
everything you went through,

46:32.538 --> 46:34.672
I should have thought about that.

46:38.915 --> 46:42.344
I'm sorry, but you don't
belong here anymore.

46:59.132 --> 47:01.700
Yeah.

47:01.733 --> 47:06.003
- I never did.
- No, I guess you didn't.

47:19.728 --> 47:21.823
Where you gonna go?

47:21.856 --> 47:24.065
- Nola!
- Don't.

47:24.098 --> 47:26.468
You're finally being a Chief.

47:26.501 --> 47:28.803
Don't ruin it by
second-guessing yourself.

48:02.111 --> 48:05.446
- Nice outfit.
- Right back at you.

48:05.479 --> 48:07.677
Thank you.

48:21.828 --> 48:26.563
- Where are we going?
- You have a visitor. This way.

48:27.901 --> 48:30.566
- In there?
- In there.

48:32.570 --> 48:34.304
Go on.

49:05.869 --> 49:08.636
Sit down.

49:15.152 --> 49:16.984
You're surprised to see me?

49:18.657 --> 49:20.319
No.

49:21.487 --> 49:22.854
Not really.

49:22.887 --> 49:26.863
It seems you and me

49:26.896 --> 49:29.200
are both very hard to kill.

49:30.497 --> 49:35.603
- It's a family trait.
- What are you doing here?

49:35.643 --> 49:39.078
I see your mother

49:39.111 --> 49:41.886
every time I look at you.

49:43.384 --> 49:45.592
It warms me.

49:46.961 --> 49:49.895
And it kills me at the same time.

49:51.665 --> 49:56.967
<i>When I met your mother,
she was with another man.</i>

49:57.000 --> 50:01.411
But I courted her shamelessly.

50:01.476 --> 50:04.074
Relentlessly.

50:04.107 --> 50:08.779
At first she thought I was insane.

50:10.652 --> 50:13.556
And then later she knew I was insane.

50:15.527 --> 50:19.032
<i>But there was no questioning my love.</i>

50:21.336 --> 50:23.233
Love.

50:23.274 --> 50:25.001
<i>Truth.</i>

50:25.042 --> 50:27.537
Insanity.

50:27.578 --> 50:32.943
These are all more connected
than people want to believe.

50:34.616 --> 50:36.508
<i>I made...</i>

50:36.581 --> 50:39.448
<i>I made mistakes, Anastasia.</i>

50:39.489 --> 50:44.058
Too many.
And too terrible to forgive.

50:47.024 --> 50:52.928
<i>But I wanted to tell you
before it's too late</i>

50:53.001 --> 50:58.303
that what you think
was insanity...

51:00.838 --> 51:06.146
was the greatest love
I have ever known.

51:14.013 --> 51:15.987
This is the last time
