WEBVTT

00:16.141 --> 00:18.132
- Shit, Victor. - We'll fight our way out.
Make it to the lobby.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.178
- Shit, Victor. - We'll fight our way out.
Make it to the lobby.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.936
- Mom!
- Oh, my God.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.442
- Alicia. Alicia.
-Mom!

00:30.488 --> 00:32.319
Alicia.

01:04.939 --> 01:06.145
Strand!

01:12.739 --> 01:14.229
Victor!

01:25.293 --> 01:27.955
- We're not...
- Yeah, we are.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.913
Let's find Alicia
and Ofelia and then we go.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.507
Son of a bitch.
The girls took the truck.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.213
No, I heard her calling.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.678
The dead don't drive,
Madison.

03:05.768 --> 03:07.269
Come on.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.573
Victor.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.190
She's fine.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.227
You don't know that.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.273
You don't know that.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.608
Madison, we can do
nothing right now.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.531
Alicia wouldn't leave.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.404
She never leaves.
It's not her.

04:47.453 --> 04:50.160
She was trapped.
She had no option.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.571
She had Ofelia
to think of.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.327
She wouldn't do it.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.742
If she had to leave
to survive,

04:55.837 --> 04:57.828
she went.

04:57.922 --> 05:00.038
She's self-reliant.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.089
Yeah.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.877
I made her that.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.791
Hydrate.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.622
Ration it.
I'm okay.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.129
You don't ration water.
You drink it and then you find more.

05:45.219 --> 05:47.050
Come on.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.391
Tequila hangover
can't be helping matters.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.301
Just drink it.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.938
You happy?

06:03.029 --> 06:04.610
Ecstatic.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.359
We should get some sleep.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.524
Any one of the massage
tables will serve,

06:09.577 --> 06:11.989
but there's
a couples room upstairs.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.162
Safer together.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.213
That's not infected.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.170
Help, somebody!

06:30.181 --> 06:31.796
Help, somebody!

06:31.891 --> 06:34.177
Someone... someone open the door!

06:34.268 --> 06:35.678
No, no! No.
Alicia!

06:35.770 --> 06:37.806
-Mom? Mom!
- It's me!

06:37.897 --> 06:39.888
- Tell her to open the door!
-Mom, quickly!

06:39.899 --> 06:42.106
- Tell her to open the door!
-Mom, quickly!

06:50.201 --> 06:52.943
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

06:55.790 --> 06:56.825
Who the hell are you?

07:56.350 --> 07:57.965
Hello.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.888
What is it?

07:59.979 --> 08:02.595
I screwed up at the trade.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.060
You compromised the colonia.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.891
Yeah.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.692
I'd like to make up for that.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.948
You need water
to prepare that milk.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.242
I'm not preparing milk.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.121
Did you ever do
any compounding here?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.199
- l have.
- Where do you keep your tools?

08:22.210 --> 08:23.620
- l have.
- Where do you keep your tools?

08:23.669 --> 08:25.534
May I?

08:25.588 --> 08:26.828
Please.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.624
I had this buddy and...

08:30.635 --> 08:31.966
I had this buddy and...

08:32.053 --> 08:34.044
well, he wasn't
the most sensible guy,

08:34.055 --> 08:35.636
well, he wasn't
the most sensible guy,

08:35.681 --> 08:37.672
but he was smart,

08:37.683 --> 08:38.934
but he was smart,

08:39.018 --> 08:41.680
creative,
very creative.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.720
And he used to do this thing

08:43.731 --> 08:45.972
And he used to do this thing

08:46.067 --> 08:49.025
when he couldn't afford
the overhead for re-up.

08:49.111 --> 08:51.067
You got a hammer?

08:51.155 --> 08:53.567
You cut the drug,
you increase the inventory.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.447
Yeah, that's the idea.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.825
The high is more immediate when
you crush the pills and shorter.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.278
- They'll know we have tampered.
- Yeah, they won't care.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.364
All they'll know is
that they're getting higher faster.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.490
All they'll know is
that they're getting higher faster.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.408
And that's the magic.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.917
- But if they suspect...
- They won't.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.995
Look, you're a pharmacist,
I'm a junkie, okay?

09:09.006 --> 09:10.121
Look, you're a pharmacist,
I'm a junkie, okay?

09:10.216 --> 09:11.797
Trust me.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.377
Please, just let me
make this right, okay?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.423
Please, just let me
make this right, okay?

09:24.647 --> 09:26.183
Thank you.

09:27.858 --> 09:29.064
Okay.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.018
Nice technique.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.639
l have a limited,
but refined skill set.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.679
This will only buy us
so much more time. You know this.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.147
This will only buy us
so much more time. You know this.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.225
Yeah, more time,
more hope.

10:12.236 --> 10:13.976
Yeah, more time,
more hope.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.062
And hope's gonna get you
a lot further than a Gansito.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.233
And hope's gonna get you
a lot further than a Gansito.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.156
Right?

10:29.670 --> 10:31.911
We should go
after Ofelia.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.005
Which way would you
have us go?

10:35.092 --> 10:36.707
If she didn't
take the truck,

10:36.761 --> 10:38.843
we'll find her here
in some state.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.095
If she did,
she had a destination.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.389
Or she ran scared
and is alone.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.805
I made a promise
to Daniel.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.355
You can forget that one.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.851
Focus on what's
in the here and now.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.731
lam.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.523
Ofelia chose to go.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.531
She didn't think
we were gonna make it.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.699
We will.
We are.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.909
Is this all we have?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.911
Yes.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.993
And the guests control
the rest of the hotel, the food stores.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.210
And the guests control
the rest of the hotel, the food stores.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.288
- Is that a lot?
- Dry goods, canned goods. Yes, a lot.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.836
- Is that a lot?
- Dry goods, canned goods. Yes, a lot.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.591
Enough for months.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.628
But these people
want us gone.

11:21.639 --> 11:22.754
But these people
want us gone.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.640
They still want me dead.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.726
Oscar!

11:36.779 --> 11:38.735
Oscar.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.023
What do you want?

11:43.119 --> 11:45.451
- Are you Oscar?
- I'm not.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.369
Well, we need to talk to him.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.414
He doesn't need
to talk to you.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.913
We're not leaving
the hotel.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.248
You're not leaving
the hotel.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.172
There's work to be done.
We need each other to do it.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.007
Lose the weapons.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.643
You can search us.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.101
Let them in.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.230
Are we sure about this?

12:19.321 --> 12:21.403
I'm tired
of running, Victor.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.834
Take a break
if you have to.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.966
No, I'm okay.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.718
Hey, you want to work
yourself into the ground, be my guest,

12:44.764 --> 12:47.631
but I don't hand out
honor badges and I don't pay overtime.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.355
So what happened?

13:00.196 --> 13:03.188
Did Luciana
not tell you?

13:03.282 --> 13:04.988
She told me she had.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.066
She just said that you were bitten
and that you didn't turn

13:07.077 --> 13:09.204
She just said that you were bitten
and that you didn't turn

13:09.288 --> 13:12.121
and she has a lot
of faith in you.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.199
Yeah, not much patience
for my doubt.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.825
Yeah, not much patience
for my doubt.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.244
No patience for me
at all, actually.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.330
Luci lacks trust,
so she tests us first.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.673
Luci lacks trust,
so she tests us first.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.254
She was testing you.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.960
But you don't
survive a bite.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.004
Oh, you don't believe
I was bitten?

13:28.098 --> 13:30.259
Um...

13:33.854 --> 13:35.685
I don't believe
in miracles.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.393
- Miracle is your word.
- What would you call it?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.566
A leap of faith.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.611
Yeah, I have trouble
with those, too.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.828
What's your plan?

14:00.881 --> 14:02.872
Ration what we have,
scavenge for what we don't.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.043
Ration what we have,
scavenge for what we don't.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.004
Do you have family
somewhere else?

14:06.053 --> 14:08.169
My family was here
when it started.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.222
Some left. Border was closed.
We were trapped.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.724
What do you want?

14:16.188 --> 14:18.850
We want your help.
We need it.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.890
- We have nothing to offer.
- You do.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.061
- We have nothing to offer.
- You do.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.859
There's opportunity here
for all of us.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.645
It's an empty hotel.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.731
What we have,
we'll run out of. There's nothing.

14:28.742 --> 14:29.948
What we have,
we'll run out of. There's nothing.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.076
You haven't been beyond
these walls, we have.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.153
You haven't seen.
This place has everything.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.290
You haven't seen.
This place has everything.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.365
You can harvest water,
grow food, fortify the gates.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.412
You can harvest water,
grow food, fortify the gates.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.919
But we have
to clear the dead.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.796
We can make
this place a home.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.299
If we help you,
that woman cannot stay.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.301
If we help you,
that woman cannot stay.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.933
Elena did what she thought
was right in the moment.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.980
Elena did what she thought
was right in the moment.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.271
She regrets it.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.321
She killed my daughter.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.400
The sickness.
The sickness killed her.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.571
The sickness.
The sickness killed her.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.653
Whatever that is,
that took your daughter.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.495
Whatever that is,
that took your daughter.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.535
We've lost
loved ones, too.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.835
But we can stop that.
We can start over.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.296
Both of our families.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.597
We have mutual interests.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.679
The next group that finds this
place... and others will find this place...

15:41.690 --> 15:43.066
The next group that finds this
place... and others will find this place...

15:43.108 --> 15:45.224
they could be cruel.
We've seen that.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.355
They're not gonna ask for your help.
They won't try to reason.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.153
They're not gonna talk.
They're gonna take and they'll kill.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.735
We've seen that, too.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.697
So we're clearing
out the infected,

15:55.788 --> 15:58.325
we're blocking the gates
and we're gonna do it alone.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.906
But it'd be a hell of a lot
easier if you'd helped us.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.423
Take the keys.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.644
Are you okay?

16:22.731 --> 16:24.392
Fine.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.474
You quiet
is not fine.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.854
You negotiated well.
You didn't need any assistance.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.610
You may have even
earned a few converts.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.234
Not with the mother.

16:32.324 --> 16:35.191
No, not with the mother.
Her grief is driving her.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.276
We need them. We lose any of these fights,
we lose a home.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.993
We need them. We lose any of these fights,
we lose a home.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.951
Victor, what's wrong
with you?

16:44.545 --> 16:46.627
I had a home.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.705
I shot Thomas.
| buried him there.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.672
I shot Thomas.
| buried him there.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.341
I'll help you
secure this place,

16:53.429 --> 16:55.420
but it's not home.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.217
but it's not home.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.439
It's good.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.017
It's really good.
They'll never know.

17:11.488 --> 17:12.944
Let's pray
that they won't.

17:15.909 --> 17:18.776
Okay, we'll be back
before dark.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.203
Wish me luck.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.954
Nick.

17:24.543 --> 17:27.285
There was a boy
no older than you.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.370
He lived
in these streets. An addict.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.416
He lived
in these streets. An addict.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.498
And he tried to steal
from me many times.

17:32.509 --> 17:33.760
And he tried to steal
from me many times.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.835
When the world changed,
this boy got his hands on something.

17:35.846 --> 17:38.383
When the world changed,
this boy got his hands on something.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.181
Something mean.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.217
To this day
l have no idea what drug he took,

17:43.228 --> 17:44.263
To this day
l have no idea what drug he took,

17:44.313 --> 17:46.304
but he was mistaken
for a sombra.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.231
A mob attacked him,

17:49.276 --> 17:51.767
herded him with
the other infected.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.729
They were killing them.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.075
So I rushed in,
I tried to save him.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.108
There were limbs,
jaws, blood.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.651
It was chaos.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.828
And in this moment

18:02.915 --> 18:05.577
as l was beaten
by the living,

18:05.667 --> 18:07.749
l was bitten
by the dead.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.245
A hand found me
and I saw Luciana.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.792
A hand found me
and I saw Luciana.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.504
She brought me
back here.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.677
We waited
for death to come.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.629
- But it didn't?
- No.

18:20.724 --> 18:22.715
- You just healed?
- Yes.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.136
- You just healed?
- Yes.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.489
What happened to the boy?

18:43.580 --> 18:45.616
They killed him.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.834
You believe
you're safe amongst them. You may be right.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.912
But you're never safe with
the Marcos of the world, the men with guns.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.129
But you're never safe with
the Marcos of the world, the men with guns.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.920
But you still like
being out there.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.002
You're desperate for it
and that scares me for you.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.139
You're desperate for it
and that scares me for you.

19:01.181 --> 19:03.046
Why? You sound
like my mother.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.931
I'm trying to be
anything but.

19:05.018 --> 19:08.010
I'm not asking you not to go.
I need you to go.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.099
Everyone here
needs you to go.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.140
I'm asking you to be careful.
Brave but careful.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.688
I'm asking you to be careful.
Brave but careful.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.939
'Cause I want you
to come back.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.731
- Well, thank you.
- For what?

19:22.244 --> 19:24.235
- For giving a shit.
- Go, go, go!

19:24.246 --> 19:25.326
- For giving a shit.
- Go, go, go!

19:25.873 --> 19:26.953
Go, pass me the ball!

19:29.501 --> 19:31.037
Over here, over here!

19:33.422 --> 19:35.708
Go, go, go!

19:35.924 --> 19:36.709
Yeah!

19:36.925 --> 19:39.416
Goal! Yeah!

19:41.138 --> 19:43.470
You play?

19:43.557 --> 19:45.548
- Yeah, when l was a kid.
- That's not fair! We have no grownups!

19:45.559 --> 19:47.971
- Yeah, when l was a kid.
- That's not fair! We have no grownups!

19:48.103 --> 19:50.094
It was her turn.
Soon it will be yours, alright?

19:50.105 --> 19:51.220
It was her turn.
Soon it will be yours, alright?

19:52.232 --> 19:53.847
Go ahead.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.689
Hey.
You need an adult?

19:58.780 --> 20:00.486
You need an adult?
Yeah?

20:00.574 --> 20:02.781
Can I play?
All right, all right, all right.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.278
Let's do this.
Let's do this.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.568
I'm in, I'm in,
I'm in, I'm in.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.573
- You're in?
- Let's do this.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.653
Right down the line.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.034
Go, kids! Let’s go!

20:10.918 --> 20:11.748
Go for it!

20:13.420 --> 20:15.001
Go, come on! Go, go!

20:15.923 --> 20:16.912
Go, go!

20:18.634 --> 20:19.919
Go, go, go!

20:20.385 --> 20:22.376
Goal!

20:22.387 --> 20:24.378
Goal!

20:24.389 --> 20:25.595
Goal!

20:25.682 --> 20:27.468
Whoo!

20:27.559 --> 20:29.470
You were an illegal substitution.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.677
Take it up
with the referee. Goal.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.186
You are a disaster.

20:34.608 --> 20:37.224
Go, come on! Come on!

20:37.569 --> 20:40.106
Here. Yeah, right here.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.325
Francisco.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.572
Calm down.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.283
Something happened.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.536
- He was torn in pieces.
- Okay.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.583
Take a deep breath.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.918
And now tell me what happened.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.384
What's wrong?

21:08.433 --> 21:10.298
They found him.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.762
Who?

21:11.853 --> 21:13.684
Pablo.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.562
Goal!

21:23.573 --> 21:24.779
Goal!

21:29.746 --> 21:31.953
Hey, hey, hey! They've got him!

21:46.763 --> 21:49.596
Luciana.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.514
You didn't
have to come.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.221
You have no Spanish, Nick.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.682
Another scout, then.
Francisco, Reynaldo.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.728
The others are
on perimeter duty. lt's us.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.558
Luciana, your boyfriend
just died.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.520
He was my brother.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.242
Jesus, I'm so sorry.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.037
One matters more
than the other?

22:15.876 --> 22:18.618
Family knows
where you come from.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.703
Yes, Pablo was
always there for me.

22:20.714 --> 22:21.874
Yes, Pablo was
always there for me.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.132
When we moved from Redondo
to work in the maquiladora.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.505
Then when
everything changed.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.546
Your parents outside
of the city?

22:30.557 --> 22:31.672
Your parents outside
of the city?

22:31.767 --> 22:34.133
My father, no.

22:34.227 --> 22:36.809
He was gone
before it began.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.888
When everyone began to die,
we sent for our mother,

22:38.899 --> 22:40.309
When everyone began to die,
we sent for our mother,

22:40.359 --> 22:42.566
but we lost contact with Mama
when she was south of the city.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.068
- We should look for her.
- We have.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.736
Pablo did.

22:48.492 --> 22:51.108
And he helped me find peace
when she joined the dead.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.194
But now I don't know
what to do.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.741
But now I don't know
what to do.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.825
I'm sorry.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.010
They can't open doors.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.686
We could just leave them.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.685
We leave one,
it gets free, we start over again.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.687
We've got
to clean sweep this.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.227
Thank you.

24:12.784 --> 24:15.526
They've come
on their own some.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.240
They followed
your lead.

24:22.586 --> 24:25.043
We're gonna need them.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.916
We need more hands.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.377
That's one floor
out of 17 out of three buildings.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.128
That's one floor
out of 17 out of three buildings.

24:35.223 --> 24:38.181
- I mean, at this rate it's gonna
take us weeks. - We don't have weeks.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.259
Can't do all this
and have some asshole take it from us.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.680
Can't do all this
and have some asshole take it from us.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.194
I'm sorry.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.704
You didn't do
anything wrong.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.286
What you said was true.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.583
You raised yourself.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.587
Especially
after Daddy died.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.589
Exactly when you
shouldn't have had to.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.592
That's on me.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.264
You didn't do
anything wrong.

25:33.573 --> 25:36.235
Alicia.

25:36.326 --> 25:37.941
Come out of the water.

25:41.831 --> 25:42.991
Alicia.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.672
We don't have to go room
by room or floor by floor.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.298
We don't have to go room
by room or floor by floor.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.642
We don't have to put
them down at all.

26:21.621 --> 26:23.782
Luciana tells me
you did as we discussed.

26:23.873 --> 26:25.955
You were cautious
at the Pelicano.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.873
Man, l was more
than cautious.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.747
l was respectful
to those pricks.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.253
I kissed ass.
Called them senor.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.625
Cut my balls off.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.464
Better your balls
than your head.

26:43.727 --> 26:46.218
Surviving feels like
eating shit.

26:46.313 --> 26:48.224
You'll get used to it.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.394
What is this?

26:52.485 --> 26:54.396
It's yours.

26:56.239 --> 26:58.230
Moving you out
of the infirmary.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.031
I need your bed.

27:13.381 --> 27:14.882
Don't need all this.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.797
You deserve it.

27:16.843 --> 27:19.505
You've given
the colonia a gift.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.840
You bought us time.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.300
| just cut some pills.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.720
It was more than that.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.744
There are three sections to the hotel,
but everything connects here.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.905
We channel them
through that room.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.866
That corridor leads
to the pier.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.910
Okay, anyone gets
in trouble, bail, find a safe place.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.001
Okay, anyone gets
in trouble, bail, find a safe place.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.421
I mean it. OthenNise channel
them all toward me

27:56.508 --> 27:58.965
and I'll lead them
to the sea.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.134
Keep your eye on them.
Stay ahead.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.428
Okay?
You're gonna be fine.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.177
-Baby?
- Let me go down to the pier.

28:07.268 --> 28:08.929
- Let me do that.
- Absolutely not.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.556
Mom, you're gonna
be trapped out there.

28:10.605 --> 28:13.017
I need you in the water.
I need you in the boat.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.099
I don't trust
anyone else.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.568
l was looking for you
in the bar...

28:25.370 --> 28:27.361
and l was trying to get
to you and l was so scared that I wouldn't.

28:27.372 --> 28:28.578
and l was trying to get
to you and l was so scared that I wouldn't.

28:31.292 --> 28:33.283
When I finally did,
I saw this dead woman.

28:33.294 --> 28:34.420
When I finally did,
I saw this dead woman.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.956
She had your hair.

28:41.970 --> 28:43.506
I thought...

28:43.596 --> 28:45.973
No, you're not
losing me.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.298
I'm not losing you.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.803
Not ever.

28:54.232 --> 28:57.190
I'll see you
in the water.

28:57.277 --> 28:59.063
- Okay?
- Yeah.

29:17.046 --> 29:18.172
Hey!

29:19.048 --> 29:20.879
Hey!

29:21.885 --> 29:22.840
Hey!

29:24.596 --> 29:25.551
Hey!

29:26.890 --> 29:28.005
Hey!

30:08.473 --> 30:10.464
Come on.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.795
They all followed?

30:39.838 --> 30:41.544
As far as we can tell.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.496
- Alicia should be here by now.
- And Hector.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.269
Okay.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.218
You sure you don't
need my help?

30:57.313 --> 30:59.304
lt'll only take one.
Just be there to meet me.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.640
All right.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.614
All the way.

32:16.726 --> 32:17.556
Go, hurry!

32:42.168 --> 32:44.750
Get in!

32:44.837 --> 32:46.373
Come on, get in!

32:50.885 --> 32:52.876
Whoa!
It's too shallow.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.260
Push us farther out.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.975
All right, we're good.
We're good.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.066
All right, we're good.
We're good.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.353
Let it go. We're good.
Let it go. Let it go.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.787
Come on.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.126
All the way.
All the way to the end.

33:33.761 --> 33:34.750
Man.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.471
Mom! Mom, we're over here!

34:28.524 --> 34:29.559
It's working.

34:29.901 --> 34:31.983
- Mom!
- Give me your hand!

34:44.624 --> 34:46.615
- We're okay.

34:46.626 --> 34:47.957
- We're okay.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.457
Come in.

35:01.015 --> 35:02.801
Come in.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.229
l was too tired to sleep.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.815
Come in.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.051
You're reading a dictionary?

35:41.097 --> 35:43.554
Yeah. Yeah.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.633
I got to learn to talk
to someone that isn't you or Alejandro.

35:48.354 --> 35:50.140
How is that going?

35:54.235 --> 35:56.271
You're wearing clean socks?

35:56.320 --> 35:58.060
Yeah, did I get that right?

35:58.114 --> 36:01.026
Close.

36:05.746 --> 36:07.657
Very good.

36:07.748 --> 36:09.534
If I had known
this was gonna happen,

36:09.625 --> 36:11.741
I'd have taken Spanish
in high school.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.872
What did you take?

36:13.963 --> 36:15.954
Uh, just myself
very seriously.

36:15.965 --> 36:18.126
Uh, just myself
very seriously.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.128
My sister took Spanish, actually.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.470
My sister took Spanish, actually.

36:24.557 --> 36:27.264
She was the golden child.
She had a future.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.392
You have a sister?

36:30.479 --> 36:32.435
Yeah.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.104
VVhy?

36:36.360 --> 36:39.227
I don't know.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.272
It's hard to imagine
you with family.

36:44.076 --> 36:46.943
Is she alive?

36:47.997 --> 36:50.454
I think so, yeah.
I hope so.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.121
What about your parents?

36:54.170 --> 36:56.161
Well, my mom was with
my sister when I left.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.288
Well, my mom was with
my sister when I left.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.215
Your father?

37:01.260 --> 37:03.251
He's gone, but before.

37:03.262 --> 37:04.638
He's gone, but before.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.678
I'm sorry.

37:08.017 --> 37:09.302
It's okay.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.718
We've all lost someone.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.863
Should we wait
for them?

37:31.874 --> 37:33.990
My brother's
not ready for this.

37:35.628 --> 37:38.415
Food will be here
when he is.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.466
What room
is the honeymoon suite?

37:47.265 --> 37:49.256
Tower 1711.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.764
Hey, I'll be back
for the toast.

38:15.459 --> 38:17.120
She in there?

38:21.090 --> 38:23.877
We met at UCSD.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.959
Took me a year to work up
the courage to talk to her.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.335
Took me a year to work up
the courage to talk to her.

38:27.388 --> 38:28.878
Just to speak.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.642
I couldn't breathe.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.187
I know that feeling.

38:39.191 --> 38:40.647
No, you don't.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.270
I never thought in a million years I'd put
a ring on her finger.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.691
I never thought in a million years I'd put
a ring on her finger.

38:49.368 --> 38:50.983
But you did.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.162
I know that feeling, too.

38:58.544 --> 39:00.455
I won't let you.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.044
I won't let you touch her.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.806
I'm sorry.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.101
It's not fair.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.731
It's not.

39:22.818 --> 39:24.433
None of it.

39:28.949 --> 39:30.735
You living with this
isn't fair either.

39:30.826 --> 39:33.784
Foryou.
Forher

39:35.581 --> 39:38.448
That's not your wife.

39:40.086 --> 39:42.623
Not anymore.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.453
How do you know?

39:44.507 --> 39:47.374
Death parted you.

39:47.426 --> 39:49.291
Your vows give you leave.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.838
I don't know what I am
without her.

39:53.933 --> 39:56.174
You'll never be the same.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.719
But then...

39:59.730 --> 40:00.810
But then...

40:00.898 --> 40:02.889
one morning you'll start
thinking like someone new.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.265
one morning you'll start
thinking like someone new.

40:05.986 --> 40:07.977
Someone you don't know yet.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.148
Someone you don't know yet.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.151
The person that comes after.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.617
I liked who I was.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.163
SO did I.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.005
Let me help you.

40:30.177 --> 40:32.168
What's your wife's name?

40:32.179 --> 40:33.510
What's your wife's name?

40:36.308 --> 40:38.299
Jessica.

40:38.352 --> 40:40.343
Jessica.

40:44.024 --> 40:46.015
Let me help Jessica.

40:46.026 --> 40:47.982
Let me help Jessica.

41:04.378 --> 41:05.993
Sorry. / fell asleep.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.045
It's okay.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.127
- No, I should go.
- No, sleep.

41:14.221 --> 41:16.212
It's okay.
I'm fine down here.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.804
It's okay.
I'm fine down here.

41:17.892 --> 41:19.928
People will talk shit.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.973
Good night.

41:23.063 --> 41:24.678
Can I ask you something?

41:29.653 --> 41:32.235
This morning

41:32.323 --> 41:34.405
Alejandro said to me

41:34.450 --> 41:36.862
that you test people.

41:39.663 --> 41:41.654
He said you were testing me.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.246
He said you were testing me.
