03:38.219 --> 03:40.262
I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

03:41.264 --> 03:42.556
You're Jerry Lundegaard?

03:42.640 --> 03:43.724
Yeah.

03:43.933 --> 03:45.017
Shep Proudfoot said...

03:45.101 --> 03:48.270
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
What gives, man?

03:48.438 --> 03:50.105
Shep said 8:30.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.356
We've been sitting here an hour.

03:51.441 --> 03:53.108
He's peed three times already.

03:53.192 --> 03:56.194
I'm sure sorry. Shep told me 8:30.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.447
It was a mix-up, I guess.

03:58.781 --> 03:59.781
You got the car?

03:59.908 --> 04:01.116
Yeah. You bet.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.827
It's out in the lot there,
brand-new, burnt umber Cierra.

04:03.912 --> 04:06.371
Yeah, okay.
Well, sit down, then.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.290
I'm Carl Showalter.

04:08.374 --> 04:10.584
This is my associate, Gaear Grimsrud.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.085
Yeah. How you doing?

04:12.170 --> 04:14.630
So, we all set on this thing, then?

04:14.714 --> 04:16.505
Sure, Jerry. We're all set.
Why wouldn't we be?

04:16.591 --> 04:17.966
Yeah, no, I'm sure you are.

04:18.051 --> 04:19.384
Shep vouched for you and all.

04:19.469 --> 04:22.304
I got every confidence here 
in you fellas.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.269
I guess that's it, then.

04:29.354 --> 04:30.395
Here are the keys.

04:30.480 --> 04:31.772
No, that's not it, Jerry.

04:31.856 --> 04:32.898
Huh?

04:32.982 --> 04:35.359
The new vehicle plus $40,000.

04:35.443 --> 04:38.028
Yeah, but the deal was the car first,

04:38.112 --> 04:41.406
then the 40,000,
like as if it was the ransom.

04:41.491 --> 04:42.574
I thought Shep told you.

04:42.659 --> 04:44.201
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

04:44.285 --> 04:45.327
Well, okay...

04:45.411 --> 04:47.579
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.

04:47.664 --> 04:49.247
Yeah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.832
Yeah, you already said that.

04:50.917 --> 04:54.503
Yeah, but it's not
a whole pay-in-advance deal.

04:54.587 --> 04:58.757
See, I give you a brand-new vehicle
in advance, and then...

04:58.841 --> 05:00.342
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

05:00.426 --> 05:01.426
Okay.

05:01.511 --> 05:03.595
I'm not gonna sit here and debate.

05:03.680 --> 05:04.721
I will say this, though.

05:04.806 --> 05:07.474
What Shep told us
didn't make a whole lot of sense.

05:07.558 --> 05:10.602
Oh, no. It's real sound.
It's all worked out.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.271
You want your own wife kidnapped.

05:13.356 --> 05:14.398
Yeah.

05:16.234 --> 05:17.442
You...

05:17.986 --> 05:19.403
My point is,

05:19.862 --> 05:22.322
you pay the ransom, what, 
80,000 bucks?

05:22.407 --> 05:26.284
I mean, you give us half the ransom,
40,000, you keep half.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.661
It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul.

05:27.745 --> 05:28.954
It doesn't make any sense.

05:29.038 --> 05:32.249
Okay, see, it's not me paying the ransom.

05:32.542 --> 05:35.210
The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.004
Her dad, he's real well-off.

05:37.088 --> 05:38.463
Now, I'm in a bit of trouble.

05:38.548 --> 05:40.007
What kind of trouble you in, Jerry?

05:40.091 --> 05:43.844
Well, that's...
I'm not gonna get into...

05:43.928 --> 05:45.345
See, I just need the money.

05:45.430 --> 05:47.556
Now, her dad, he's real well-off.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.349
So, why don't you just ask him 
for the money?

05:49.434 --> 05:50.809
Or your fucking wife, you know?

05:50.893 --> 05:52.310
Or your fucking wife, Jerry?

05:52.395 --> 05:53.603
Well...

05:54.397 --> 05:56.440
It's all part of this...

05:58.401 --> 06:00.110
They don't know I need it, see?

06:00.194 --> 06:03.405
Okay, so there's that.
And even if they did, I wouldn't get it,

06:03.489 --> 06:04.990
so there's that on top, then.

06:05.074 --> 06:06.324
See, these are personal matters.

06:06.409 --> 06:07.409
Personal matters?

06:07.493 --> 06:10.412
Yeah, personal matters that needn't...

06:10.663 --> 06:12.414
Okay, Jerry.

06:12.498 --> 06:16.501
You're tasking us to perform this mission,
but you won't...

06:16.586 --> 06:18.086
You won't...

06:20.423 --> 06:22.883
Fuck it.
Let's take a look at that Cierra.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.100
Hon?

06:32.643 --> 06:34.853
Hi, hon!
Welcome back!

06:35.271 --> 06:36.772
How was Fargo?

06:36.856 --> 06:38.523
Yeah, real good.

06:38.775 --> 06:40.275
Dad's here.

06:42.945 --> 06:45.822
<i>...leads the Badgers in goal production
with five this year.</i>

06:46.032 --> 06:47.032
How you doing, Wade?

06:47.116 --> 06:48.200
Yeah, pretty good.

06:48.284 --> 06:49.284
What you watching there?

06:49.368 --> 06:50.410
Gophers.

06:50.495 --> 06:51.870
Who they playing?

06:51.954 --> 06:52.996
Ooh!

06:59.670 --> 07:01.338
Is he staying for supper, then?

07:01.422 --> 07:03.131
Yeah. I think so.

07:03.674 --> 07:04.841
- Dad?
- What?

07:04.926 --> 07:06.218
Are you staying for supper?

07:06.302 --> 07:07.427
Yeah.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.144
May I be excused?

07:16.229 --> 07:17.229
You done there?

07:17.313 --> 07:18.730
Uh-huh. I'm going out.

07:18.815 --> 07:20.565
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

07:20.650 --> 07:21.817
Just McDonald's.

07:21.901 --> 07:23.568
- Back at 9:30.
- Okay.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.404
He just ate.
He didn't finish.

07:26.489 --> 07:29.074
Going to McDonald's 
instead of finishing here.

07:29.158 --> 07:30.659
He sees his friends there.
It's okay.

07:30.743 --> 07:32.410
It's okay, McDonald's?

07:32.495 --> 07:34.287
What do you think they do there?

07:34.372 --> 07:36.414
They don't drink milk shakes,
I assure you.

07:36.499 --> 07:37.999
It's okay, Dad.

07:44.507 --> 07:47.425
Wade, have you had a chance 
to think about

07:47.510 --> 07:49.010
that deal I was talking about,

07:49.095 --> 07:50.762
those 40 acres there, in Wayzata?

07:50.847 --> 07:52.264
You told me about it.

07:52.348 --> 07:54.266
Yeah, you said you'd have 
to think about it.

07:54.350 --> 07:55.767
I understand.
It's a lot of money.

07:55.852 --> 07:58.770
It's a heck of a lot.
What did you say you were gonna put there?

07:58.855 --> 08:00.147
A lot. It's a...

08:00.231 --> 08:01.690
I know it's a lot.

08:01.774 --> 08:02.941
I mean a parking lot.

08:03.025 --> 08:06.027
Well, 750,000 is a lot.

08:06.737 --> 08:07.946
Yeah, well, it's a chunk, but...

08:08.030 --> 08:11.074
I had a couple lots, late 50s.
Lost a lot of money.

08:11.159 --> 08:12.784
- A lot of money.
- Yeah, but the difference...

08:12.869 --> 08:15.036
I thought you were gonna show it 
to Stan Grossman.

08:15.121 --> 08:17.372
He passes on this stuff
before it gets kicked up to me.

08:17.456 --> 08:20.000
Well, Stan'll say, "No dice."
That's why you pay him.

08:20.084 --> 08:22.085
I'm asking you here, Wade.

08:22.837 --> 08:26.381
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

08:26.716 --> 08:29.259
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.067
Where is Pancakes House?

08:47.320 --> 08:48.320
What?

08:48.404 --> 08:50.530
We stop at Pancakes House.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.326
What are you, nuts?
We had pancakes for breakfast.

08:54.410 --> 08:55.994
Gotta go to a place
where I can get a shot

08:56.078 --> 08:57.662
and a beer and a steak, maybe.

08:57.747 --> 09:00.165
Not more fucking pancakes.
Come on.

09:05.171 --> 09:07.172
Oh, come on, man.

09:08.633 --> 09:10.508
Okay. Here's an idea.

09:11.052 --> 09:12.260
We can stop outside of Brainerd.

09:12.345 --> 09:14.679
I know a place there where we can get laid.
What do you think?

09:14.764 --> 09:16.681
I'm fucking hungry now, you know.

09:16.766 --> 09:20.435
Yeah, yeah, Jesus.
I'm saying we can stop, get pancakes,

09:20.519 --> 09:22.938
and then we'll get laid, all right?

09:31.280 --> 09:33.198
<i>Lou Diamond, line one.</i>

09:35.910 --> 09:37.285
We sat right here in this room

09:37.370 --> 09:38.828
and went over this and over this.

09:38.913 --> 09:39.955
Yeah, but that TruCoat...

09:40.039 --> 09:42.958
I sat right here and said 
I didn't want any TruCoat.

09:43.042 --> 09:45.043
Yeah, but I'm saying that TruCoat.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.128
You don't get it,
you get oxidation problems.

09:47.213 --> 09:48.713
It'll cost you a heck 
of a lot more than $500.

09:48.798 --> 09:49.881
You're sitting there.

09:49.966 --> 09:51.007
You're talking in circles.

09:51.092 --> 09:52.926
You're talking like
we didn't go over this already.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.094
Yeah, but this TruCoat...

09:54.178 --> 09:56.304
We had a deal here for 19,500.

09:56.389 --> 09:58.098
You sat there and darned
if you didn't tell me

09:58.182 --> 09:59.891
you'd get me this car,
these options,

09:59.976 --> 10:01.893
without the sealant, for 19,500.

10:01.978 --> 10:03.436
All right, I'm not saying I didn't.

10:03.521 --> 10:05.063
You called me 20 minutes ago and said

10:05.147 --> 10:06.856
you had it ready to make delivery.

10:06.941 --> 10:08.566
You says,
"Come on down and get it."

10:08.651 --> 10:12.779
And here you are, and you're wasting 
my time and my wife's time,

10:12.863 --> 10:15.782
and I'm paying 19,500
for this vehicle here.

10:16.492 --> 10:17.867
All right.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.495
I'll talk to my boss.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.959
See, they install that TruCoat
at the factory.

10:26.043 --> 10:29.462
There's nothing we can do,
but I'll talk to my boss.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.799
These guys here.
These guys.

10:34.135 --> 10:36.678
It's always the same.
It's always more.

10:41.058 --> 10:42.642
You going to the Gophers on Sunday?

10:42.727 --> 10:44.227
Oh, you betcha.

10:44.312 --> 10:46.688
You wouldn't have an extra ticket?

10:47.690 --> 10:49.149
You kidding?

10:51.027 --> 10:52.068
Well...

10:54.947 --> 10:56.614
he never done this before,

10:56.699 --> 10:59.451
but seeing as
it's special circumstances and all,

10:59.535 --> 11:02.454
he says I can knock $100 off that TruCoat.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.582
100?

11:06.375 --> 11:08.626
You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.462
You're a bald-faced liar.

11:10.546 --> 11:12.172
Bucky, please.

11:12.256 --> 11:14.841
A fucking liar.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.426
Bucky, please.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.054
Where's my goddamn checkbook?

11:19.138 --> 11:20.764
Let's get this over with.

11:22.016 --> 11:23.391
Where is it?

11:58.427 --> 12:02.597
<i>From Hollywood,
The Tonight Show, starring...</i>  

12:04.600 --> 12:07.018
I am talking about your potential.

12:07.103 --> 12:08.103
Mmm-hmm.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.814
You're not a C student.

12:11.023 --> 12:12.232
Yeah.

12:12.525 --> 12:14.651
Yet you're getting C grades.

12:15.069 --> 12:18.029
It's that disparity there
that concerns your dad and me.

12:18.114 --> 12:19.114
Uh-huh.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.533
You know what a disparity is?

12:21.617 --> 12:22.659
Yeah!

12:22.743 --> 12:24.869
Okay! Well, that's why we...

12:24.954 --> 12:27.247
We don't want you going out for hockey.

12:27.331 --> 12:28.665
Oh, man!

12:28.749 --> 12:30.667
Come on. What's the big deal?
It's just an hour...

12:30.793 --> 12:32.544
Hold on.

12:32.628 --> 12:33.878
What's the big deal?

12:33.963 --> 12:35.046
Hello?

12:35.131 --> 12:36.923
<i>- Yeah, hiya, hon.</i>
- Oh, hi, Dad.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.091
<i>Is Jerry around?</i>

12:38.175 --> 12:40.051
Yeah. Hon!
Yeah, he's here.

12:40.136 --> 12:41.386
Yeah, I'll catch him for you.

12:41.470 --> 12:42.595
- Hon!
- Yeah?

12:42.680 --> 12:44.264
- It's Dad.
- Okay.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.307
Look, Dad, there's no fucking way...

12:46.392 --> 12:47.392
Scotty!

12:47.476 --> 12:49.811
Hey, let's watch that language there.

12:49.895 --> 12:51.062
How you doing there, Wade?

12:51.147 --> 12:52.230
<i>What's going on there?</i>

12:52.314 --> 12:54.691
Nothing, Wade.
How you doing there?

12:54.775 --> 12:56.818
<i>Stan Grossman looked at your proposal.</i>

12:56.902 --> 12:58.194
<i>He says it's pretty sweet.</i>

No kidding?

12:59.363 --> 13:00.572
<i>Might be interested.</i>

13:01.073 --> 13:04.993
No kidding?
I'd need the cash pretty quick there,

13:05.077 --> 13:06.578
in order to close the deal.

13:06.662 --> 13:08.288
<i>Come by at 2:30.
We'll talk about it.</i>

13:08.372 --> 13:11.416
<i>If your numbers are right, 
Stan says it's pretty sweet.</i>

13:11.500 --> 13:13.334
<i>- Stan, you know, Grossman.</i>
- Yeah.

13:13.419 --> 13:14.419
<i>2:30.</i>

13:14.503 --> 13:15.628
Yeah. Okay.

13:30.311 --> 13:32.270
Say, Shep, how you doing there?

13:32.354 --> 13:34.272
Say, you know those two fellas

13:34.356 --> 13:36.024
you put me in touch with up there in Fargo?

13:36.108 --> 13:37.775
I put you in touch with Grimsrud.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.569
Yeah, well, he had a buddy there.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.820
He...
Then I don't vouch for him.

13:40.905 --> 13:41.988
Well, that's okay.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.282
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his buddy?

13:44.366 --> 13:45.950
Carl something.

13:46.035 --> 13:47.452
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch for him.

13:47.536 --> 13:50.497
Well, that's okay.
He's a buddy of the guy you vouched for,

13:50.581 --> 13:51.998
so I'm not worried. I just...

13:52.082 --> 13:54.501
I was wondering, see, 
I got to get in touch with him.

13:54.585 --> 13:58.505
See, this deal I needed him for, 
I may not need it anymore.

13:58.589 --> 14:00.548
- Something's happening, see.
- Call him up.

14:00.633 --> 14:04.052
Yeah, well, see, I did that,
and I haven't been able to get him,

14:04.136 --> 14:07.305
so I thought maybe you'd know 
an alternate number, or what have you.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.389
Nope.

14:08.474 --> 14:10.308
Okay. Well...

14:10.392 --> 14:11.893
Real good, then.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.582
Can you crack a fucking window open, man?

14:36.418 --> 14:40.421
You know, it's proven
that secondhand smoke is...

14:40.506 --> 14:42.507
You know, a cancer agent.

14:44.218 --> 14:46.427
Hey, look at that.
Twin Cities.

14:46.512 --> 14:48.096
That's the IDS Building,
the big glass one.

14:48.180 --> 14:53.226
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest 
after the Sears in Chicago,

14:53.310 --> 14:55.937
or John Hancock building, whatever.

14:56.021 --> 14:58.565
You ever been to Minneapolis?

14:58.649 --> 14:59.774
No.

15:02.403 --> 15:04.862
Would it kill you to say something?

15:05.489 --> 15:06.698
I did.

15:07.116 --> 15:11.119
"No." That's the first thing you've said 
in the last four hours.

15:11.620 --> 15:12.954
That's a...

15:13.038 --> 15:15.623
That's a fountain of conversation, man.

15:15.708 --> 15:17.375
That's a geyser.

15:17.459 --> 15:20.253
I mean, whoa, daddy.
Stand back, man.

15:21.714 --> 15:23.214
Shit.

15:23.299 --> 15:25.049
I'm sitting here driving.

15:25.134 --> 15:26.509
I'm doing all the driving, man,

15:26.594 --> 15:28.303
whole fucking way from Brainerd, driving.

15:28.387 --> 15:31.097
Just trying to chat.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.766
You know, keep our spirits up,

15:33.851 --> 15:34.934
fight the boredom of the road,

15:35.019 --> 15:39.188
and you can't say one fucking thing 
just in the way of conversation?

15:40.608 --> 15:43.318
Oh, fuck it. 
I don't have to talk either, man.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.194
See how you like it.

15:49.033 --> 15:50.992
Just total fucking silence.

15:51.076 --> 15:53.453
Two could play at that game, smart guy.

15:53.537 --> 15:55.830
We'll just see how you like it.

15:58.334 --> 15:59.876
Total silence.

16:02.296 --> 16:05.548
<i>Mr. Lundegaard,
this is Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC.</i>

16:05.633 --> 16:06.758
<i>How are you this morning?</i>

16:06.842 --> 16:08.134
Real good. How you doing?

16:08.218 --> 16:09.636
<i>Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.</i>

16:09.720 --> 16:11.763
<i>You're damn hard to get 
on the phone.</i>

16:11.847 --> 16:14.265
It's pretty darn busy here,
but that's the way we like it.

16:14.350 --> 16:15.391
<i>Well, that's for sure.</i>

16:15.476 --> 16:17.393
<i>Now, I just need on these last,</i>

16:17.478 --> 16:19.520
<i>these financing documents
that you sent us,</i>

16:19.605 --> 16:21.773
<i>I can't read the serial numbers
of the vehicles.</i>

16:21.857 --> 16:23.149
Yeah, but I already got the...

16:23.233 --> 16:24.651
It's okay.
The loans are in place.

16:24.735 --> 16:26.486
I already got the...
What? The... 

16:26.570 --> 16:27.820
<i>Yeah, the 320,000.</i>

16:27.905 --> 16:29.364
<i>You got the money last month.</i>

16:29.448 --> 16:30.823
Yeah, so we're all set, then.

16:30.908 --> 16:33.117
<i>Yeah, but the vehicles
that you're borrowing on,</i>

16:33.202 --> 16:36.120
<i>I just can't read the serial numbers
on your application.</i>

16:36.205 --> 16:37.372
<i>Maybe if you could just read...</i>

16:37.456 --> 16:38.498
Yeah, but the deal's already done.

16:38.582 --> 16:39.707
I already got the money.

16:39.792 --> 16:41.250
<i>Yes, but if we have an audit here,</i>

16:41.335 --> 16:42.710
<i>I just have to know that these vehicles</i>

16:42.795 --> 16:44.128
<i>you're financing with this money,</i>

16:44.213 --> 16:45.505
<i>that they really exist.</i>

16:45.589 --> 16:47.799
Yeah, well, they exist, all right.

16:47.883 --> 16:49.550
<i>I'm sure they do,</i>

16:49.635 --> 16:53.012
<i>but I can't read the serial numbers here,
so if you could read me...</i>

16:53.097 --> 16:56.057
Yeah, but... See...

16:56.642 --> 16:57.934
I don't have them in front of me.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.477
Why don't I just fax you over a copy?

16:59.561 --> 17:01.145
<i>No, well, no, fax is no good.</i>

17:01.230 --> 17:03.231
<i>That's what I have,
and I can't read the darn thing.</i>

17:03.315 --> 17:06.067
Yeah, okay. I'll have my girl
send you a copy, then.

17:06.151 --> 17:09.487
<i>Okay, because if I can't correlate this note
with the specific vehicles,</i>

17:09.570 --> 17:11.614
<i>then I got to call back that money.</i>

17:11.699 --> 17:13.074
Yeah, how much money was that?

17:13.157 --> 17:16.077
<i>320,000.
I got to correlate that money</i>

17:16.161 --> 17:17.619
<i>with the cars it's being lent on.</i>

17:17.704 --> 17:19.830
Yeah. Okay, no problem.
I'll just fax that right over.

17:19.915 --> 17:20.873
<i>No, no, no. Fax...</i>

17:20.958 --> 17:22.750
I mean, send it over.
I'll shoot it right over to you, then.

17:22.835 --> 17:23.960
<i>Okay, okay. Fine.</i>

17:24.044 --> 17:25.920
Okay. Real good, then.

17:32.428 --> 17:34.262
<i>- We're back with Katie Carlson.
- Hi.</i> 

17:34.346 --> 17:35.388
<i>Now, before we get going here,</i>

17:35.472 --> 17:37.473
<i>we just want to remind
all of our viewers at home</i>

17:37.558 --> 17:39.642
<i>that this March,
for the second year in a row,</i>

17:39.727 --> 17:42.019
<i>Katie and I,
along with Twin City Travel,</i>

17:42.104 --> 17:44.689
<i>will be leading a two-week riverboat trip
down the Nile.</i>

17:44.773 --> 17:46.566
<i>It's a terrific time.
I know you've heard about it.</i>

17:46.650 --> 17:49.902
<i>We want all of you to come with...</i>

17:50.404 --> 17:51.612
<i>and that's the truth.</i>

17:53.240 --> 17:55.324
<i>Okay, now, for those of you
that just joined us,</i>

17:55.409 --> 17:56.868
<i>Katie here, this morning,
is going to show us</i>

17:56.952 --> 18:00.037
<i>how to make Holidazzle eggs ourselves, 
at home.</i>

18:00.122 --> 18:01.956
<i>-Now, Katie, I gotta admit...
- What?</i> 

18:02.040 --> 18:04.542
<i>I was a little bit surprised
when I first picked this up.</i>

18:04.626 --> 18:05.585
<i>Right.</i>

18:05.669 --> 18:06.711
<i>This is an empty egg.</i>

18:06.795 --> 18:08.004
<i>That's right, Dale.</i>

18:08.088 --> 18:09.088
<i>Well, how do you get the egg...</i>

18:09.131 --> 18:10.381
<i>- There was an egg in here, right?
- Yeah.</i> 

18:10.466 --> 18:13.301
<i>Okay, well, I don't...
How do you... I mean, you don't have</i>

18:13.385 --> 18:16.345
<i>an empty chicken somewhere
that lays empty eggs?</i>

18:16.430 --> 18:17.472
<i>No, no.</i>

18:17.806 --> 18:20.141
<i>I guarantee, this was
an honest-to-goodness...</i>

18:35.407 --> 18:36.407
Unguent.

18:36.492 --> 18:37.492
What?

18:37.576 --> 18:39.327
I need unguent.

18:45.709 --> 18:46.918
No.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.052
No...

19:19.326 --> 19:20.535
You want to do it?

19:20.619 --> 19:21.828
Push.

20:21.597 --> 20:23.848
- How are you, Stan?
- How you doing, Wade?

20:23.932 --> 20:25.850
Good to see you again, Jerry.

20:25.976 --> 20:28.519
If these numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

20:28.604 --> 20:30.021
Those numbers are right, all right.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.147
Believe me.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.356
This is doable.

20:32.441 --> 20:33.691
Congratulations, Jer.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.651
Yeah, thanks, Stan.
Well, it's a pretty...

20:35.736 --> 20:38.821
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

20:39.615 --> 20:40.656
Huh?

20:41.116 --> 20:43.451
The financials are pretty thorough,

20:43.535 --> 20:46.412
so the only thing we don't know 
is your fee.

20:46.496 --> 20:47.872
My fee?

20:48.582 --> 20:50.541
Wade, what the heck
are you talking about?

20:50.626 --> 20:52.001
Stan and I are okay.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.920
- Yeah.
- We're good to load in.

20:54.004 --> 20:55.421
Yeah.

20:55.505 --> 20:59.133
But we never talked about your fee
for bringing it to us.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.552
No, but, Wade, see,
I was bringing you this deal

21:01.637 --> 21:03.054
for you to loan me the money to put in.

21:03.138 --> 21:05.014
It's my deal here, see.

21:07.059 --> 21:09.352
Jerry, we thought you were bringing us
an investment.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.645
Yeah. Right.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.605
You're saying...

21:13.273 --> 21:14.273
What are you saying?

21:14.358 --> 21:15.608
You're saying we put in all the money,

21:15.692 --> 21:17.109
and you collect when it pays off.

21:19.529 --> 21:21.697
No, no. See... 
But I'd...

21:21.782 --> 21:24.408
I'd pay you back the principal and interest.

21:24.493 --> 21:27.161
Heck, I'd go one over prime?

21:27.496 --> 21:28.663
We're not a bank, Jerry.

21:28.747 --> 21:30.790
If I wanted bank interest on 750,000,

21:30.874 --> 21:33.876
I'd go to Midwest Federal,
talk to old Bill Diehl.

21:33.961 --> 21:35.294
- He's at North Star.
- He's at...

21:35.379 --> 21:37.338
No, no. See, I...

21:38.340 --> 21:41.217
I don't need a finder's fee.
I need...

21:41.885 --> 21:43.844
Finder's fee is, what, 10%?

21:43.929 --> 21:45.388
Heck, that's not gonna do it for me.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.597
I need the principal.

21:46.682 --> 21:49.934
Well, Jerry, we're not gonna 
just give you $750,000.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.435
What the heck were you thinking?

21:51.520 --> 21:52.812
If I'm only getting bank interest,

21:52.896 --> 21:55.690
I want complete security.
Heck, FDIC.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.233
I don't see nothing like that here.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.859
Yeah, but I...

22:01.530 --> 22:02.947
Okay. I...

22:03.031 --> 22:04.782
I guarantee you your money back.

22:04.866 --> 22:08.077
I'm not talking 
about your damn word, Jerry.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.370
Jeez!
What the heck are you...

22:09.454 --> 22:11.163
We're not a bank, Jerry.

22:11.707 --> 22:14.208
Well, look. I don't want 
to cut you out of the loop,

22:14.292 --> 22:16.669
but this here's a good deal.

22:16.878 --> 22:19.088
I assume, if you're not interested,

22:19.172 --> 22:22.550
you won't mind
if we move on it independently.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.779
Damn it!

23:56.144 --> 23:57.269
Hon?

23:59.940 --> 24:01.732
I got the groceries!

24:38.311 --> 24:41.689
Yeah, Wade, hi.
It's Jerry. I...

24:43.942 --> 24:47.695
Wade, it's Jerry.
I don't know what to do. It's Jean.

24:47.779 --> 24:50.406
I don't know what to do.
It's my wife.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.950
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

24:54.995 --> 24:58.164
Yeah, Wade, I...
It's Jerry. I...

25:00.333 --> 25:02.960
Wade, it's Jerry.
I... We gotta talk.

25:03.044 --> 25:05.963
It's something... Jeez. 
It's terrible.

25:16.308 --> 25:18.434
Yeah, Wade Gustafson, please.

25:54.304 --> 25:56.388
Shut the fuck up,

25:56.473 --> 25:59.099
or I'll throw you back into the trunk,
you know.

25:59.184 --> 26:02.436
Jesus, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

26:10.111 --> 26:12.071
Shit.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.908
Oh, the tags.

26:21.248 --> 26:23.624
All right, it's just the tags.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.960
I never put my tags on the car.

26:27.963 --> 26:31.006
All right, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

26:54.572 --> 26:56.240
All right, just keep it
still back there, lady,

26:56.324 --> 26:59.785
or else we're gonna have to, 
you know, to shoot you.

27:07.794 --> 27:10.087
Hey, I'll take care of this.

27:33.403 --> 27:35.529
How can I help you, Officer?

27:45.332 --> 27:46.999
This is a new car, then, sir?

27:47.083 --> 27:50.085
It certainly is, Officer.
Still got that smell.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.630
You're required to display
temporary tags,

27:53.715 --> 27:56.342
either in the plate area or taped 
to the inside of the back window.

27:56.426 --> 27:57.468
Certainly.

27:57.552 --> 27:59.928
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

28:00.013 --> 28:01.388
Certainly.

28:04.309 --> 28:07.269
Yeah, I was gonna tape up those...
The tag.

28:07.729 --> 28:11.982
You know, to be in full compliance,
but it must have...

28:12.067 --> 28:14.151
It must have slipped my mind.

28:15.570 --> 28:16.862
So maybe the best thing to do would be

28:16.946 --> 28:19.406
to take care of that
right here in Brainerd.

28:20.909 --> 28:22.618
What's this, sir?

28:23.328 --> 28:25.496
My license and registration.

28:26.581 --> 28:28.957
Yeah, I want to be in compliance.

28:30.794 --> 28:33.504
I was just thinking we could take care
of it right here,

28:33.588 --> 28:35.047
in Brainerd.

28:40.887 --> 28:44.056
Put that back in your pocket, please,

28:44.140 --> 28:46.725
and step out of the car,
please, sir.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.376
Shut the fuck up.

29:29.894 --> 29:31.019
Whoa.

29:32.897 --> 29:34.356
Whoa, daddy.

29:36.985 --> 29:39.319
You'll take care of it.

29:43.158 --> 29:45.576
You are smooth, smooth, you know?

29:47.328 --> 29:49.037
Oh, daddy.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.041
Just clear him off the road.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.085
Yeah.

31:49.117 --> 31:50.325
No!

33:46.734 --> 33:48.026
Oh, jeez.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.367
Hi. It's Marge.

33:57.286 --> 33:58.829
Oh, my. Where?

33:59.872 --> 34:00.997
Yeah?

34:02.417 --> 34:03.709
Oh, jeez.

34:05.962 --> 34:07.754
Okay. There in a jiff.

34:08.255 --> 34:09.880
Real good, then.

34:18.433 --> 34:20.726
You can sleep.
It's early yet.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.226
Got to go?

34:22.311 --> 34:23.478
Yeah.

34:24.397 --> 34:26.273
I'll fix you some eggs.

34:26.733 --> 34:28.900
It's okay, hon.
I gotta run.

34:28.985 --> 34:31.445
You got to eat a breakfast, Marge.

34:33.364 --> 34:35.282
I'll fix you some eggs.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.243
Hon, you can sleep.

34:38.619 --> 34:40.661
You gotta eat a breakfast.

34:44.167 --> 34:46.083
I'll fix you some eggs.

34:47.253 --> 34:48.378
Norm.

34:55.303 --> 34:57.471
Thanks, hon.
Time to shove off.

34:58.139 --> 34:59.222
Love you, Margie.

34:59.307 --> 35:00.599
Love you, hon.

35:33.758 --> 35:34.758
Hon?

35:34.842 --> 35:35.801
Yeah?

35:35.885 --> 35:37.677
Prowler needs a jump.

35:57.448 --> 35:58.824
Hiya, Lou.

35:59.951 --> 36:02.327
What you got there?

36:02.453 --> 36:05.455
Margie, thought you might need
a little warm-up.

36:05.540 --> 36:07.290
Thanks a bunch.

36:07.375 --> 36:08.625
So what's the deal now?

36:08.709 --> 36:09.960
Gary says triple homicide?

36:10.044 --> 36:11.294
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

36:11.379 --> 36:13.004
Two of them are over here.

36:13.422 --> 36:14.965
Where is everybody?

36:15.049 --> 36:17.884
Well, it's cold, Margie.

36:20.096 --> 36:22.138
Watch your step, Margie.

36:31.941 --> 36:33.900
Jeez. So...

36:34.527 --> 36:36.194
Jeez!

36:36.279 --> 36:38.196
Here's the second one!

36:39.365 --> 36:41.992
It's in the head and the hand there.

36:43.411 --> 36:45.328
I guess that's a defensive wound.

36:45.413 --> 36:46.997
Oh, yeah?

36:47.874 --> 36:50.125
Where's the state trooper?

36:50.209 --> 36:53.879
Back there a good piece,
in the ditch next to his prowler.

36:54.130 --> 36:55.338
Okay.

36:56.173 --> 36:58.842
So we got a trooper pulls someone over.

36:58.926 --> 37:00.343
We got a shooting.

37:00.428 --> 37:01.845
These folks drive by.

37:01.929 --> 37:04.514
There's a high-speed pursuit,
ends here,

37:04.599 --> 37:06.850
and then this execution-type deal.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.059
Yeah.

37:09.478 --> 37:12.522
I'd be very surprised
if our suspect was from Brainerd.

37:12.607 --> 37:13.773
Yeah.

37:15.359 --> 37:17.193
And I'll tell you what.

37:17.278 --> 37:20.363
From his footprint,
he looks like a big fella.

37:23.743 --> 37:26.411
You see something down there, Chief?

37:26.495 --> 37:29.289
No. I just think I'm gonna barf.

37:29.373 --> 37:30.498
Jeez.

37:31.542 --> 37:33.043
You okay, Margie?

37:33.127 --> 37:34.711
Yeah. I'm fine.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.299
It's just morning sickness.

37:41.636 --> 37:43.303
Well, that passed.

37:43.387 --> 37:44.471
Yeah?

37:44.555 --> 37:46.181
Yeah. Now I'm hungry again.

37:46.849 --> 37:48.892
You have breakfast yet, Margie?

37:48.976 --> 37:50.435
Oh, yeah.

37:50.811 --> 37:52.020
Norm made some eggs.

37:52.104 --> 37:53.229
Yeah?

37:54.148 --> 37:55.273
Well...

37:56.484 --> 37:58.443
What now, do you think?

37:58.986 --> 38:00.570
Let's go take a look at that trooper.

38:03.991 --> 38:05.492
There's different footprints here, Lou.

38:05.576 --> 38:06.618
Yeah?

38:06.702 --> 38:09.371
Yeah. This guy's smaller than his buddy.

38:09.455 --> 38:10.705
Oh, yeah?

38:11.499 --> 38:13.208
For Pete's sake.

38:13.292 --> 38:14.668
How's it look, Marge?

38:15.127 --> 38:17.754
Well, he's got his gun
on his hip there,

38:18.130 --> 38:20.674
and he looks like a nice enough guy.

38:20.967 --> 38:22.759
It's a real shame.

38:22.843 --> 38:24.177
Yeah.

38:26.889 --> 38:28.640
Didn't monkey with his car there,
did you?

38:28.724 --> 38:29.808
No way.

38:29.892 --> 38:31.559
Well, somebody shut his lights.

38:31.644 --> 38:33.019
I guess the little guy sat in there

38:33.104 --> 38:34.437
waiting for his buddy to come back.

38:34.522 --> 38:36.106
Yeah, it would have been cold out here.

38:36.190 --> 38:39.109
Heck, yeah.
You think is Dave open yet?

38:39.193 --> 38:40.360
Dave?

38:41.195 --> 38:42.862
You don't think he's mixed up in...

38:42.947 --> 38:46.282
Oh, no, no. I just want to get Norm
some night crawlers.

38:48.995 --> 38:50.996
Did you look in his citation book?

38:51.080 --> 38:56.292
Yeah. Last vehicle he wrote in 
was a tan Cierra at 2:18 a.m.

38:56.377 --> 38:58.628
Under plate number he put "DLR."

38:58.713 --> 39:00.338
I figure they stopped him or shot him

39:00.423 --> 39:03.466
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

39:03.551 --> 39:07.053
So, I got the State looking for a Cierra
with a tag starting "DLR."

39:07.138 --> 39:09.222
They don't got no match yet.

39:10.224 --> 39:12.308
I'm not sure that I agree with you 100%

39:12.393 --> 39:14.394
on your police work there, Lou.

39:14.478 --> 39:15.812
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:16.397 --> 39:19.649
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

39:20.359 --> 39:21.526
"DLR."

39:23.863 --> 39:24.863
Oh.

39:26.866 --> 39:27.991
Jeez.

39:29.577 --> 39:30.994
Say, Lou...

39:31.078 --> 39:32.162
did you hear the one about the guy

39:32.246 --> 39:33.788
who couldn't afford personalized plates,

39:33.873 --> 39:37.208
so he went and changed his name 
to J3L-2404?

39:38.252 --> 39:40.253
Yeah. That's a good one.

39:47.511 --> 39:51.389
<i>Look, all's I know is,
you got a problem, you call a professional.</i>

39:51.474 --> 39:53.308
No. They said no cops.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.143
They were darn clear on that, Wade.

39:55.227 --> 39:57.187
They said, "You call your cops, 
and we're gonna shoot..."

39:57.271 --> 39:58.688
Of course they're gonna say that.

39:58.773 --> 40:00.815
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.817
If I give these sons of bitches $1 million,

40:02.902 --> 40:04.694
where's my guarantee
they're gonna let her go?

40:04.779 --> 40:05.737
Well, they...

40:05.821 --> 40:06.905
$1 million is a lot of damn money.

40:06.989 --> 40:08.698
Yeah, but... There they are.
They got my daughter.

40:08.783 --> 40:10.283
Think this thing through here, Wade.

40:10.367 --> 40:13.286
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

40:13.370 --> 40:16.247
You got to listen to me
on this one, Wade.

40:16.332 --> 40:18.124
Heck, you don't know.

40:18.209 --> 40:20.210
You're just whistling Dixie here.

40:20.294 --> 40:22.337
I'm saying the cops,
they can advise us on this.

40:22.421 --> 40:23.671
I'm saying call a professional.

40:23.756 --> 40:25.673
No. No cops.

40:26.717 --> 40:29.219
That's final.
This is my deal here, Wade.

40:29.303 --> 40:30.303
Yeah.

40:30.387 --> 40:32.388
Jean is my wife here.

40:32.473 --> 40:35.308
I gotta tell you, Wade,
I'm leaning to Jerry's viewpoint here.

40:35.392 --> 40:36.392
Well...

40:36.477 --> 40:38.645
We got to protect Jean.
These...

40:38.729 --> 40:40.522
We're not holding any cards here, Wade.

40:40.606 --> 40:42.565
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

40:42.650 --> 40:43.733
You're darn tooting.

40:43.818 --> 40:44.901
Oh, damn it.

40:44.985 --> 40:46.194
I'm telling you.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.655
Well, why don't we...

40:49.448 --> 40:52.283
Stan, I'm thinking we should offer them
a half a million.

40:52.368 --> 40:53.785
Now, come on here!

40:53.869 --> 40:55.870
No way, Wade.
No way.

40:55.955 --> 40:57.288
We're not horse-trading here, Wade.

40:57.373 --> 40:58.414
Yeah.

40:58.499 --> 41:00.166
We gotta just bite the bullet
on this thing.

41:00.251 --> 41:01.376
Yeah.

41:03.295 --> 41:06.089
So, well, what's the next step here, Jerry?

41:06.173 --> 41:08.758
They're gonna call me up
and give me instructions for a drop.

41:08.843 --> 41:10.426
I'm supposed to have the money
ready tomorrow.

41:10.511 --> 41:11.678
Damn it!

41:14.431 --> 41:15.974
How was everything today?

41:16.058 --> 41:17.851
Yeah. Real good, now.

41:19.687 --> 41:21.187
How you doing?

41:21.730 --> 41:25.150
Okay.
Now, we'll get the money together.

41:25.234 --> 41:27.318
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

41:27.403 --> 41:31.322
Now, do you want anyone at home with you
till they call?

41:31.407 --> 41:32.907
No, I...
They don't...

41:32.992 --> 41:34.784
They were just supposed 
to be dealing with me.

41:34.869 --> 41:36.035
- They were real clear.
- Yeah. 

41:36.120 --> 41:38.288
You know, they said no one listening in.

41:38.372 --> 41:39.581
They'll be watching.

41:39.665 --> 41:41.624
You know, maybe it's all bull,

41:41.709 --> 41:44.252
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

41:44.336 --> 41:45.503
Okay.

41:45.963 --> 41:48.548
Now, is Scotty gonna be all right?

41:50.426 --> 41:52.343
Yeah. Jeez. Scotty.

41:52.887 --> 41:54.679
Yeah. I'll go talk to him.

42:10.404 --> 42:12.530
How you doing there, Scotty?

42:12.948 --> 42:14.157
Dad...

42:15.075 --> 42:16.910
What are they doing?

42:17.745 --> 42:19.370
What do you think
they're doing with Mom?

42:19.455 --> 42:21.122
It's okay, Scotty.

42:21.248 --> 42:22.957
They're not gonna wanna hurt her any.

42:23.042 --> 42:25.668
These men, they just want money.

42:26.337 --> 42:28.504
Yeah, well,
what if something goes wrong, Dad?

42:28.589 --> 42:32.175
No, no.
Nothing's going wrong here.

42:32.259 --> 42:36.471
Granddad and I, we're, we're making sure
this gets handled right.

42:37.389 --> 42:39.557
I really think
we should call the cops here.

42:39.642 --> 42:42.936
No. No. No one can know 
about this thing.

42:43.354 --> 42:45.271
We gotta play ball with these guys.

42:45.356 --> 42:47.482
You ask Stan Grossman,
he'll tell you the same thing.

42:47.566 --> 42:48.524
Yeah. But, Dad...

42:48.609 --> 42:52.111
We're gonna get Mom back for you,
but we gotta play ball.

42:52.363 --> 42:53.613
You know?

42:55.157 --> 42:57.033
That's the deal here.

43:01.163 --> 43:03.957
So if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,

43:04.041 --> 43:07.585
you just say Mom's down in Florida,
with Pearl and Marty.

43:11.632 --> 43:13.925
That's the best we can do here.

43:57.636 --> 43:58.970
No!

44:16.071 --> 44:17.113
No!

44:22.536 --> 44:24.287
Oh, God.

44:40.346 --> 44:41.429
Lunchtime.

44:41.513 --> 44:42.680
Thanks, Margaret.

44:42.765 --> 44:44.515
Hi. Hey.

44:45.059 --> 44:46.601
Willy. Carol.

44:47.353 --> 44:49.312
Janie, two more of those
Skin So Soft, please.

44:49.396 --> 44:50.396
Sure thing.

44:51.899 --> 44:53.316
Hiya, hon.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.193
I brought you some lunch, Margie.

44:56.320 --> 44:57.487
What are those?
Night crawlers?

44:57.571 --> 44:58.654
Yeah.

44:58.739 --> 44:59.989
Oh, thanks, hon.

45:00.074 --> 45:02.158
You bet.
Thanks for lunch.

45:02.242 --> 45:04.369
Yeah.
Looks pretty good.

45:04.453 --> 45:07.330
What do we got here, Arby's?

45:07.414 --> 45:08.915
How's the painting going?

45:08.999 --> 45:10.458
Pretty good.

45:11.335 --> 45:13.920
Found out the Hautmans are entering
a painting this year.

45:14.004 --> 45:16.130
Hon, you're better than them.

45:16.215 --> 45:18.091
They're real good.

45:18.175 --> 45:21.260
They're good, Norm,
but you're better than them.

45:22.262 --> 45:23.679
You think so?

45:25.307 --> 45:27.600
Hey, you got Arby's all over me.

45:29.978 --> 45:32.063
Hiya, Norm.
How's the painting going?

45:32.147 --> 45:33.689
Not too bad, you know.

45:33.774 --> 45:35.066
How we doing on that vehicle?

45:35.150 --> 45:37.819
Well, no motels registered
any tan Cierra last night,

45:37.903 --> 45:41.322
but the night before,
two men checked into the Blue Ox,

45:41.407 --> 45:44.534
registering a Cierra
and leaving the tag space blank.

45:44.618 --> 45:45.743
Jeez, that's a good lead.

45:45.828 --> 45:46.911
Yeah.

45:46.995 --> 45:49.497
Blue Ox, that's that truckers' joint
out there on I-35?

45:49.581 --> 45:52.208
Yeah. Owner was on the desk then.

45:52.292 --> 45:54.210
Said these two had company.

45:54.294 --> 45:55.378
Oh, yeah?

45:55.504 --> 45:56.629
Yeah.

46:00.551 --> 46:02.844
<i>Yeah, we both did.
She went to college, too.</i>

46:02.928 --> 46:04.804
I went to Normandale for about
a year and a half.

46:04.888 --> 46:06.013
Yeah, that's where we met.

46:06.098 --> 46:07.181
But I dropped out, though.

46:07.266 --> 46:08.307
Yeah, she dropped.

46:08.392 --> 46:09.434
Yeah.

46:09.768 --> 46:11.227
So where you girls from?

46:11.311 --> 46:13.146
- Chaska.
- Le Sueur.

46:13.230 --> 46:15.398
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.

46:15.482 --> 46:16.732
Go Bears.

46:17.526 --> 46:21.237
Okay. I want you to tell me 
what these fellows looked like.

46:21.488 --> 46:23.406
Well, the little guy,
he was kind of funny-looking.

46:23.490 --> 46:24.490
In what way?

46:24.575 --> 46:26.492
I don't know.
Just funny-looking.

46:26.577 --> 46:28.911
Can you be any more specific?

46:28.996 --> 46:30.371
I couldn't really say.

46:30.456 --> 46:31.873
He wasn't circumcised.

46:33.333 --> 46:35.793
Was he funny-looking apart from that?

46:35.878 --> 46:37.003
Yeah.

46:38.297 --> 46:41.841
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then.

46:42.176 --> 46:43.384
Uh-huh.

46:43.469 --> 46:45.470
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

46:45.554 --> 46:48.431
No. Like I say,
he was funny-looking.

46:48.515 --> 46:50.558
More than most people, even.

46:50.642 --> 46:51.809
What about the other fella?

46:51.894 --> 46:53.060
He was a little older.

46:53.145 --> 46:54.896
You know, he looked like
the Marlboro Man.

46:54.980 --> 46:56.606
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

46:56.690 --> 46:58.149
But maybe I'm saying that, you know,

46:58.233 --> 47:00.568
'cause he smoked a lot of Marlboros.

47:00.652 --> 47:02.445
You know, like a subconscious
type of thing.

47:02.529 --> 47:03.696
Oh, yeah, that can happen.

47:03.780 --> 47:04.822
Yeah.

47:04.907 --> 47:06.949
Hey, they said they were going 
to the Twin Cities.

47:07.034 --> 47:08.493
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

47:08.577 --> 47:10.077
Yeah, is that useful to you?

47:10.162 --> 47:11.704
You betcha. Yeah.

47:11.788 --> 47:13.122
- Yeah.
- Yeah. 

47:15.292 --> 47:16.459
<i>Come on!</i>

47:17.669 --> 47:18.920
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

47:21.215 --> 47:22.882
Jesus Christ.

47:24.760 --> 47:26.385
Fucking shitbox.

47:27.804 --> 47:29.555
Been here for days.

47:30.891 --> 47:32.767
Damn it.
Nothing to do.

47:34.061 --> 47:36.103
Fucking TV doesn't even...

47:38.065 --> 47:41.817
Damn it, come on! Plug me in, man.
Give me a fucking signal.

47:43.612 --> 47:45.321
Goddamn it!

47:47.824 --> 47:49.784
Unbelievable! Come on!

47:50.327 --> 47:51.327
God...

47:52.162 --> 47:53.329
Fuck!

47:53.413 --> 47:56.707
Come on, plug me into the ozone, baby! 
Come on!

47:58.252 --> 47:59.544
Come on!

48:01.338 --> 48:03.089
Fuck! Fuck!

48:04.216 --> 48:05.675
Fuck! Fuck!

48:12.307 --> 48:15.851
<i>The bark beetle carries the worm 
to its nest</i>

48:17.020 --> 48:20.231
<i>where it will feed its young
for up to six months.</i>

48:22.943 --> 48:26.195
<i>In the spring, the larvae hatch,
and the cycle begins again.</i>

48:26.280 --> 48:27.530
Well...

48:28.824 --> 48:30.700
I'm turning in, Norm.

48:31.201 --> 48:32.535
Oh, yeah?

48:35.455 --> 48:37.790
<i>Here it is, 
throwing off the larval envelope.</i>

48:51.847 --> 48:52.888
Hello?

48:52.973 --> 48:54.974
<i>Yeah. Is this Marge?</i>

48:55.267 --> 48:56.309
Yeah.

48:56.393 --> 48:58.019
<i>Margie Olmstead?</i>

48:59.104 --> 49:01.230
Yeah. Who's this?

49:01.315 --> 49:03.566
<i>This is Mike Yanagita!</i>

49:03.650 --> 49:06.235
<i>You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?</i>

49:08.655 --> 49:10.156
Mike Yanagita?

49:10.240 --> 49:11.657
<i>Yeah!</i>

49:12.242 --> 49:14.368
Well, yeah!

49:15.037 --> 49:16.662
Course I remember you.

49:16.747 --> 49:19.206
How are you doing?
What time is it?

49:19.291 --> 49:21.709
<i>Oh, jeez. It's 10:45.</i>

49:21.793 --> 49:23.169
<i>I hope I didn't wake you.</i>

49:23.253 --> 49:26.005
No. That's okay.

49:26.089 --> 49:28.174
<i>Yeah, I'm down in the Twin Cities,</i>

49:28.258 --> 49:31.135
<i>and I was just watching on TV 
about these shootings up in Brainerd.</i>

49:31.219 --> 49:32.720
<i>And I saw you on the news there.</i>

49:32.804 --> 49:33.846
Yeah.

49:33.930 --> 49:35.473
<i>I thought, 
"Jeez, is that Margie Olmstead?"</i>

49:35.557 --> 49:36.724
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

49:36.808 --> 49:39.101
Yeah, that's me.

49:39.853 --> 49:41.520
<i>Well, how the heck are you?</i>

49:41.605 --> 49:43.230
Okay. You know.

49:44.107 --> 49:45.107
Okay.

49:45.192 --> 49:46.692
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

49:47.319 --> 49:48.778
How you doing?

49:48.862 --> 49:50.488
<i>Pretty good.</i>

49:51.490 --> 49:53.115
Well, heck.

49:53.200 --> 49:55.534
It's been such a long time, Mike.

49:56.328 --> 49:58.412
It's great to hear from you.

50:01.750 --> 50:03.626
Yeah, you got your...

50:03.710 --> 50:06.796
This is loaded here.
This has your independent...

50:06.880 --> 50:10.216
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

50:10.300 --> 50:13.219
antilock brakes, alarm, radar,

50:13.720 --> 50:16.305
and I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

50:16.390 --> 50:18.641
This TruCoat stuff,
it'll keep the salt off.

50:18.725 --> 50:20.559
Yeah, I don't need no sealant, though.

50:20.644 --> 50:22.478
Yeah. You don't need that.

50:22.562 --> 50:24.313
Now, were you thinking
of financing here?

50:24.398 --> 50:27.024
You ought to be aware
of this GMAC plan they have now.

50:27.109 --> 50:28.150
It's really super.

50:28.235 --> 50:29.402
Got a call for you, Jerry.

50:29.486 --> 50:30.861
Yeah, okay.

50:37.786 --> 50:38.953
Jerry Lundegaard.

50:39.037 --> 50:41.163
<i>All right, Jerry,
you got the phone to yourself?</i>

50:41.248 --> 50:42.331
Well, yeah.

50:42.416 --> 50:43.457
<i>You know who this is?</i>

50:43.542 --> 50:45.501
Well, yeah, I got an idea.

50:45.585 --> 50:47.461
How's that Cierra working out for you?

50:47.546 --> 50:49.797
<i>Circumstances have changed, Jerry.</i>

50:49.881 --> 50:51.006
Well...

50:51.883 --> 50:52.883
What do you mean?

50:52.968 --> 50:56.679
<i>Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry, 
beyond the acts of God.</i>

50:56.763 --> 50:57.847
<i>Force majeure.</i>

50:57.931 --> 50:59.181
What the...

50:59.266 --> 51:00.599
How's Jean?

51:02.060 --> 51:03.060
<i>Who's Jean?</i>

51:03.145 --> 51:05.104
My wife. What the...

51:05.188 --> 51:07.231
<i>She's all right, but there's 
three people up in Brainerd</i>

51:07.315 --> 51:08.524
<i>who aren't so okay,
I'll tell you that.</i>

51:08.608 --> 51:09.775
What the heck are you talking about?

51:09.860 --> 51:11.485
Let's just finish this deal up here.

51:11.570 --> 51:13.738
<i>Blood has been shed, Jerry.</i>

51:14.489 --> 51:15.531
What the heck do you mean?

51:15.615 --> 51:17.491
<i>Three people in Brainerd.</i>

51:17.576 --> 51:18.617
Oh, jeez.

51:18.702 --> 51:20.745
<i>That's right,
and we need more money.</i>

51:20.829 --> 51:22.037
What the heck are you talking about?

51:22.122 --> 51:24.039
What do you fellas got yourself 
mixed up in?

51:24.124 --> 51:25.166
<i>We need more money...</i>

51:25.250 --> 51:27.293
This was supposed to be
a no-rough-stuff type deal.

51:27.377 --> 51:29.962
<i>Don't ever interrupt me, Jerry!
Just shut the fuck up!</i>

51:30.046 --> 51:32.214
Well, I'm sorry, but I just, I...

51:32.299 --> 51:34.425
<i>I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
I'm not gonna debate!</i>

51:34.509 --> 51:36.051
<i>We now want the entire 80,000.</i>

51:36.136 --> 51:38.012
Oh, for Christ's sake here.

51:38.096 --> 51:39.305
<i>Blood has been shed.</i>

51:39.389 --> 51:40.639
<i>We've incurred risk, Jerry.</i>

51:40.724 --> 51:41.891
<i>I'm coming into town tomorrow.</i>

51:41.975 --> 51:43.058
<i>You have the money ready.</i>

51:43.143 --> 51:45.561
Now, we had a deal here.
A deal's a deal.

51:45.645 --> 51:46.687
<i>Is it, Jerry?</i>

51:46.772 --> 51:48.939
<i>You ask those three poor souls 
up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal.</i>

51:49.024 --> 51:50.149
<i>Go ahead, ask them!</i>

51:50.233 --> 51:51.275
The heck do you mean?

51:51.359 --> 51:53.778
<i>"The heck do you mean?"
I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

51:58.033 --> 51:59.033
Yeah?

51:59.117 --> 52:00.159
<i>Jerome Lundegaard?</i>

52:00.243 --> 52:01.285
Yeah.

52:01.369 --> 52:03.037
<i>This is Reilly Diefenbach at GMAC.</i>

52:03.121 --> 52:05.873
<i> Sir, I've not received
those vehicle IDs you promised.</i>

52:05.957 --> 52:07.291
Yeah. I...

52:07.709 --> 52:08.959
Those are in the mail.

52:09.044 --> 52:11.796
<i>That very well may be.
I must inform you, however,</i>

52:11.880 --> 52:14.673
<i>that absent the receipt
of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon,</i>

52:14.758 --> 52:17.259
<i>I will have to refer this matter 
to our legal department.</i>

52:17.344 --> 52:18.385
Yeah.

52:18.470 --> 52:20.221
<i>- My patience is at an end.</i> 
- Yeah.

52:20.305 --> 52:21.806
<i>- Good day, sir.</i>
- Yeah.

53:20.657 --> 53:23.117
Hi, Norm.
How you doing, Margie? 

53:23.869 --> 53:25.202
How's the fricassee?

53:25.287 --> 53:26.745
Pretty darn good.
You want some?

53:26.830 --> 53:28.080
Oh, no. I got...

53:28.164 --> 53:32.126
Hey, Norm, I thought you was going 
ice fishing up at Mille Lacs.

53:32.794 --> 53:34.503
Yeah. After lunch.

53:34.963 --> 53:36.297
What you got there?

53:36.381 --> 53:38.799
The numbers you asked for.

53:38.884 --> 53:41.552
Calls made from the lobby pay phone
at the Blue Ox.

53:41.636 --> 53:43.679
Two to Minneapolis that night.

53:43.763 --> 53:45.097
First one's a trucking company

53:45.181 --> 53:47.057
and second one's a private residence,

53:47.142 --> 53:48.809
a Shep Proudfoot.

53:49.936 --> 53:51.186
A what?

53:51.271 --> 53:53.522
Shep Proudfoot.
That's a name.

53:54.274 --> 53:55.482
Yeah.

53:56.610 --> 53:58.235
Okay. Yeah.

53:59.321 --> 54:01.196
Think I'll take a drive
down there, then.

54:01.281 --> 54:03.198
Oh, yeah?
Twin Cities.

54:05.952 --> 54:07.244
Oh, yeah?

54:21.426 --> 54:24.303
Damn it, I want to be a part 
of this thing.

54:24.387 --> 54:26.597
No. Wade, they were real clear.

54:26.681 --> 54:28.557
They said they'd call tomorrow
with instructions,

54:28.642 --> 54:30.517
and it's gotta be delivered 
by me alone.

54:30.602 --> 54:32.853
It's my money, I'll deliver it.

54:33.355 --> 54:34.647
What do they care?

54:34.731 --> 54:36.023
Wade's got a point, there.

54:36.107 --> 54:37.566
I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.

54:37.651 --> 54:38.901
No, no. See, they...

54:38.985 --> 54:41.236
No. See, they only deal with me.

54:41.321 --> 54:45.074
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

54:45.158 --> 54:47.868
They're very...
These guys are dangerous.

54:47.953 --> 54:50.454
All the more reason.
I don't want you...

54:50.538 --> 54:53.415
With all due respect, Jerry,
I don't want you mucking this up.

54:53.500 --> 54:54.500
What the heck do you mean?

54:54.584 --> 54:56.126
They want my money,
they can deal with me.

54:56.211 --> 54:57.711
Otherwise, I'm going to a professional.

54:57.796 --> 54:59.421
No, see...
There's $1 million here.

54:59.506 --> 55:00.589
No. See...

55:00.674 --> 55:03.467
Look, Jerry,
you're not selling me a damn car!

55:03.551 --> 55:05.886
It's my show here.
That's that!

55:07.597 --> 55:10.557
It's the way we'd prefer
to handle it, Jerry.

55:16.606 --> 55:18.649
Hi. How you doing?

55:18.733 --> 55:20.442
Real good.
How are you doing today, ma'am?

55:20.527 --> 55:22.778
I'm doing really super there. 
Thanks.

55:22.862 --> 55:25.698
I'm Mrs. Gunderson.
I have a reservation.

55:26.866 --> 55:29.201
Yep.
You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

55:29.869 --> 55:32.204
Is there a phone down here, you think?

55:34.374 --> 55:36.041
Detective Sibert?

55:36.126 --> 55:39.670
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

55:40.422 --> 55:42.965
Yeah. Well, actually,
I'm in town here.

55:43.049 --> 55:45.009
I had to do a few things
in the Twin Cities,

55:45.093 --> 55:46.677
so I thought I'd check in with you

55:46.761 --> 55:49.263
about that USFI search
on Shep Proudfoot.

55:51.016 --> 55:52.307
Oh, yeah?

55:53.184 --> 55:56.353
Well, maybe I'll go visit with him
if I have...

55:56.438 --> 55:58.313
No. I can find that.

55:59.357 --> 56:00.482
Yeah. Well, thanks a bunch.

56:00.567 --> 56:03.360
Say, say, would you happen to know

56:03.445 --> 56:06.363
a good place for lunch
in the downtown area?

56:07.198 --> 56:08.657
The Radisson.

56:09.701 --> 56:11.744
Oh, yeah?
Is it reasonable?

57:28.863 --> 57:30.948
Hi. How you doing?

57:31.032 --> 57:33.492
Yeah. I decided not to park here.

57:33.952 --> 57:36.161
Well, what do you mean?
You decided not to park here?

57:36.246 --> 57:39.081
Yeah, I just came in and I decided
not to park here, so...

57:39.165 --> 57:41.834
But...
Well, I'm sorry, sir...

57:41.918 --> 57:44.211
Yeah, I decided not to... I...

57:45.130 --> 57:46.296
You know, I'm not...

57:46.381 --> 57:48.715
I decided not to take the trip,
as it turns out, so...

57:48.800 --> 57:52.010
Well, I'm sorry, sir,
we still got to charge you the $4.

57:53.847 --> 57:55.139
I just pulled in here.

57:55.265 --> 57:56.598
I just fucking pulled in here.

57:56.683 --> 57:57.766
Well, but...

57:57.851 --> 58:00.310
See, there's a minimum charge of $4.

58:00.395 --> 58:03.188
Long-term parking charges by the day.

58:07.902 --> 58:11.029
I guess you think you're, you know,
like an authority figure.

58:11.114 --> 58:13.448
That stupid fucking uniform,
huh, buddy?

58:13.533 --> 58:14.950
King clip-on tie there.

58:15.034 --> 58:16.451
Big fucking man, huh?

58:17.078 --> 58:19.329
You know, these are the limits 
of your life, man.

58:19.414 --> 58:20.789
Ruler of your little fucking gate here.

58:20.874 --> 58:23.500
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

58:26.087 --> 58:27.588
Where's Shep?

58:27.839 --> 58:29.506
Talking to a cop.

58:29.591 --> 58:30.757
Cop?

58:31.092 --> 58:32.843
Said she was a cop.

58:35.471 --> 58:38.307
So do you remember getting a call
Wednesday night?

58:38.391 --> 58:39.516
Nope.

58:40.143 --> 58:43.395
You do reside there 
at 1425 Freemont Terrace?

58:43.479 --> 58:44.479
Yep.

58:44.564 --> 58:46.565
Anyone else residing there?

58:46.649 --> 58:47.733
No.

58:47.817 --> 58:51.820
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call 
came in past 3:00 in the morning.

58:51.905 --> 58:56.033
It's just hard for me to believe 
you don't remember anyone calling.

58:56.534 --> 58:58.827
Now, I know you've had some problems.

58:58.912 --> 59:00.746
Struggling with the narcotics,

59:00.830 --> 59:03.749
some other entanglements,
currently on parole.

59:04.459 --> 59:05.459
So?

59:05.543 --> 59:06.960
Well, associating with criminals,

59:07.045 --> 59:08.295
if you're the one they talked to,

59:08.379 --> 59:11.506
that right there would be a violation
of your parole.

59:11.591 --> 59:14.092
Would end you up back in Stillwater.

59:14.510 --> 59:16.511
Now, I saw some rough stuff
on your priors,

59:16.596 --> 59:18.180
but nothing in the nature of a homicide.

59:18.264 --> 59:22.267
I know you don't want to be an accessory
to something like that.

59:24.229 --> 59:25.354
So, you think you might remember

59:25.438 --> 59:27.940
who those folks were who called you?

59:36.824 --> 59:38.075
Mr. Lundegaard?

59:38.159 --> 59:39.368
Yeah.

59:39.452 --> 59:41.328
Could I take just a minute
of your time here?

59:41.412 --> 59:43.205
What is it all about?

59:43.790 --> 59:44.957
Do you mind if I sit down?

59:45.041 --> 59:47.084
Carrying quite a load here.

59:47.293 --> 59:49.169
You're the owner here,
Mr. Lundegaard?

59:49.254 --> 59:51.588
No. I...
Executive Sales Manager.

59:51.673 --> 59:53.507
Well, you can help me.
My name's Marge Gunderson.

59:53.591 --> 59:55.717
My father-in-law, he's the owner.

59:55.802 --> 59:56.969
Uh-huh.

59:57.053 --> 59:59.054
Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd,

59:59.138 --> 01:00:00.889
investigating some malfeasance.

01:00:00.974 --> 01:00:03.433
And I was just wondering
if you'd had any new vehicles

01:00:03.518 --> 01:00:06.603
stolen off the lot
in the past couple of weeks.

01:00:07.814 --> 01:00:10.148
Specifically a tan Cutlass Cierra.

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:16.280
Mr. Lundegaard.

01:00:18.866 --> 01:00:20.158
Brainerd.

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:22.244
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:22.328 --> 01:00:24.830
Home of Paul Bunyan, Babe, the Blue Ox.

01:00:24.914 --> 01:00:26.581
Babe, the Blue Ox.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:33.797
Yeah, you know,
we got that big statue up there.

01:00:36.301 --> 01:00:39.928
So, you haven't had any vehicles
go missing, then?

01:00:40.013 --> 01:00:41.513
Nope. No, ma'am.

01:00:42.432 --> 01:00:43.724
Okey-dokey.
Thanks a bunch.

01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:46.810
I'll let you get back
to your paperwork, then.

01:01:00.992 --> 01:01:02.534
<i>- Service.</i>
- Yeah, get me Shep.

01:01:02.618 --> 01:01:03.869
<i>He's not here right now.</i>

01:01:03.953 --> 01:01:04.995
What the heck do you mean?

01:01:05.079 --> 01:01:06.621
<i>He stepped out.</i>

01:01:06.706 --> 01:01:08.165
- Where'd he go? It's only...
<i>- I'll get you Artie.</i>

01:01:08.249 --> 01:01:11.418
No. I don't need a mechanic. 
I need a...

01:01:13.963 --> 01:01:17.507
Jeez. I gotta talk to a friend of his,

01:01:17.967 --> 01:01:19.551
so...

01:01:20.178 --> 01:01:22.220
Have him...

01:01:23.556 --> 01:01:24.639
<i>What?</i>

01:01:24.724 --> 01:01:25.724
Oh, jeez.

01:01:46.579 --> 01:01:47.704
Mike?

01:01:48.581 --> 01:01:49.706
Marge?

01:01:51.626 --> 01:01:54.336
Jeez! Oh, you look great!

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:56.671
Yeah. So do you.
Easy there. Easy...

01:01:56.756 --> 01:02:00.092
Easy there. Easy there.
You do, too. 

01:02:00.176 --> 01:02:01.802
I'm expecting now.

01:02:01.886 --> 01:02:04.096
I see that. That's great.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.555
What can I get you?

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.516
Just a Diet Coke, please.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.184
Great.

01:02:09.936 --> 01:02:11.228
This is a nice place.

01:02:11.312 --> 01:02:14.773
Yeah. You know, it's the Radisson,
so it's pretty good.

01:02:14.941 --> 01:02:15.982
Yeah.

01:02:20.446 --> 01:02:21.530
So...

01:02:22.281 --> 01:02:23.698
You're living in Edina, then?

01:02:23.783 --> 01:02:25.867
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A couple of years now.

01:02:25.952 --> 01:02:27.702
It's actually Eden Prairie.

01:02:27.787 --> 01:02:29.329
That school district.

01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:32.416
So, Chief Gunderson, then!

01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:35.377
So, you went and married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:37.129
Oh, yeah. Long time ago.

01:02:37.213 --> 01:02:38.839
Great, great.

01:02:39.173 --> 01:02:41.633
So, what brings you down?

01:02:42.135 --> 01:02:43.844
Are you down here on that homicide,

01:02:43.928 --> 01:02:46.179
if you're allowed, you know,
to discuss that?

01:02:46.264 --> 01:02:47.556
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.434
But there's not a heck 
of a lot to discuss.

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:52.853
Okay.

01:02:52.937 --> 01:02:54.229
Well, what about you, Mike?

01:02:54.313 --> 01:02:55.564
Are you married?

01:02:55.648 --> 01:02:56.731
You got kids?

01:02:56.816 --> 01:02:58.608
Yeah, yeah. Well...

01:02:59.152 --> 01:03:01.862
I was married.
I was married to...

01:03:01.946 --> 01:03:03.864
You mind if I sit over here?

01:03:03.948 --> 01:03:05.949
I was married to Linda Cooksey.

01:03:06.033 --> 01:03:09.119
No. Why don't you sit over there?
I prefer that.

01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:13.457
Okay.

01:03:16.335 --> 01:03:17.419
Sorry.

01:03:17.503 --> 01:03:20.255
No, no. Just so I can see you.
Don't have to turn my neck.

01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:22.591
Sure, sure. I understand.

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:25.093
I didn't mean to...

01:03:25.178 --> 01:03:28.638
No, no. That's fine.

01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:33.185
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

01:03:34.061 --> 01:03:36.605
So, I was married to Linda Cooksey.

01:03:36.689 --> 01:03:39.483
You remember Linda.
She was a year behind us.

01:03:39.567 --> 01:03:41.026
Yeah. I think I remember her.

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:43.904
Yeah! She...
Oh, yeah!

01:03:43.988 --> 01:03:45.572
So, it didn't work out, huh?

01:03:45.656 --> 01:03:49.201
And then I've been working for Honeywell
for a few years now.

01:03:49.285 --> 01:03:50.452
Well, they're a good outfit.

01:03:50.536 --> 01:03:54.289
Yeah, if you're an engineer, yeah,
you could do a lot worse.

01:03:54.373 --> 01:03:56.041
But it's not...

01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:58.293
It's nothing like your achievement.

01:03:58.377 --> 01:04:01.379
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

01:04:01.464 --> 01:04:03.048
It's not that...

01:04:03.132 --> 01:04:06.384
It's not that things didn't work out. 
It's...

01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:10.597
Linda had leukemia, you know.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:13.517
She was...
She passed away.

01:04:13.601 --> 01:04:15.018
No.

01:04:17.438 --> 01:04:18.563
It was tough.

01:04:18.648 --> 01:04:19.940
There you go.

01:04:20.399 --> 01:04:22.067
It was long...

01:04:23.444 --> 01:04:26.071
She fought real hard, Marge.

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:28.323
You know...

01:04:29.075 --> 01:04:30.659
So, what can you say?

01:04:33.621 --> 01:04:35.914
Better times, huh?

01:04:35.998 --> 01:04:37.457
Better times.

01:04:40.044 --> 01:04:44.881
And then I saw you on the TV
and I remembered, you know?

01:04:45.091 --> 01:04:46.758
I always liked you.

01:04:46.842 --> 01:04:48.093
Well, I always liked you...

01:04:48.177 --> 01:04:49.928
I always liked you so much.

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.893
So, Mike, should we get together
another time, you think?

01:04:56.978 --> 01:04:58.311
No! I...

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:04.317
I'm sorry. It's...

01:05:04.402 --> 01:05:06.778
You know,
I shouldn't have done this.

01:05:06.862 --> 01:05:08.905
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:11.533
I thought we'd have
a really terrific time.

01:05:11.617 --> 01:05:13.034
It's okay, Mike.

01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:15.620
You were such a super lady.

01:05:15.705 --> 01:05:18.957
And then...
I've been so lonely.

01:05:21.836 --> 01:05:23.336
It's okay, Mike.

01:05:29.677 --> 01:05:33.513
<i>Here's a song I dedicate 
to all the ladies out here tonight.</i>

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:35.807
Goes like this.

01:05:36.684 --> 01:05:39.728
<i>Let's find each other tonight</i>

01:05:40.563 --> 01:05:42.981
<i>Everything will be all right</i>

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.318
<i>Don't hesitate now</i> 

01:05:46.402 --> 01:05:48.069
<i>Let's find each other tonight</i>

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:49.487
So...

01:05:50.156 --> 01:05:52.115
Are you from around here?

01:05:52.908 --> 01:05:54.743
Just in town on business.

01:05:55.328 --> 01:05:56.411
Just in and out.

01:05:59.165 --> 01:06:01.708
Just a little of the old in-and-out.

01:06:02.835 --> 01:06:04.252
What do you do?

01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:06.588
I...

01:06:10.593 --> 01:06:12.093
You been to the Celebrity Room before?

01:06:12.178 --> 01:06:14.137
With other clients?

01:06:14.639 --> 01:06:16.097
I don't think so.

01:06:16.182 --> 01:06:17.641
It's nice.

01:06:17.725 --> 01:06:20.185
Yeah, well, depends on the artist.

01:06:20.353 --> 01:06:23.480
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

01:06:24.106 --> 01:06:25.190
Waiter!

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.027
What is he, deaf?

01:06:29.862 --> 01:06:31.112
So...

01:06:32.198 --> 01:06:34.574
How long you work
for the escort service?

01:06:34.659 --> 01:06:36.743
I don't know. A few months.

01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:40.330
Find that work interesting, do you?

01:06:41.415 --> 01:06:43.458
What are you talking about?

01:06:44.001 --> 01:06:45.293
Right.

01:06:45.378 --> 01:06:46.711
Come on.

01:06:46.796 --> 01:06:48.797
I'm hearing bells.
Come on.

01:06:50.633 --> 01:06:53.176
All right. Where were you?

01:06:57.390 --> 01:07:00.809
Shep, what the hell are you doing?
I'm banging that girl.

01:07:00.893 --> 01:07:05.271
Fucking asshole.
Get the fuck out of here.

01:07:05.398 --> 01:07:08.358
Put me back in Stillwater,
you little fucking shithead.

01:07:08.442 --> 01:07:09.984
Get the fuck out of here.

01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:13.071
Yo! Cut that shit out, man.

01:07:13.155 --> 01:07:15.115
Trying to get some goddamn sleep here.

01:07:16.242 --> 01:07:17.283
Come on, brother...

01:07:17.368 --> 01:07:18.618
Fuck you!

01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:26.459
Fuck you.

01:07:26.544 --> 01:07:27.711
Animals!

01:07:29.714 --> 01:07:31.339
Stay away from me, man.

01:07:31.424 --> 01:07:33.508
Hey, smoke a fucking peace pipe!

01:07:33.592 --> 01:07:35.468
Don't you dare fucking hit me!

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:44.602
Fucking little weasel!

01:07:44.687 --> 01:07:46.396
- Fuck you, man.
- Stop it! 

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.316
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

01:07:50.401 --> 01:07:54.028
Jesus Christ! 
You fucking shitbag motherfucker!

01:07:57.992 --> 01:07:58.992
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:07:59.076 --> 01:08:00.285
All right, Jerry,
I'm through fucking around.

01:08:00.369 --> 01:08:01.453
<i>You got the fucking money?</i>

01:08:01.537 --> 01:08:03.580
Yeah, I got the money, but...

01:08:03.664 --> 01:08:05.373
<i>Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.</i>

01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:08.418
<i>I want you to put this money
in the Dayton Radisson parking ramp, top level,</i>

01:08:08.502 --> 01:08:10.044
<i>30 minutes, Jerry,
we wrap this thing up.</i>

01:08:10.129 --> 01:08:11.171
Okay. But...

01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:13.506
Hey, you're there in 30 minutes
or I find you, Jerry,

01:08:13.591 --> 01:08:15.049
and I shoot you 
and I shoot your fucking wife,

01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:16.426
and I shoot all 
your little fucking children

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:19.011
and I shoot them all in the back 
of their little fucking heads. You got it?

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:20.889
Okay, now, you stay away from Scotty, now.

01:08:20.973 --> 01:08:22.015
<i>Got it?</i>

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:23.725
Okay. Real good, then.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:50.001
Dad.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:52.002
It's okay, Scotty.

01:08:52.087 --> 01:08:53.755
Where you going?

01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:56.174
I'll be back in a minute.

01:08:56.425 --> 01:09:00.761
If Stan calls,
you just tell him I went to Embers.

01:09:03.098 --> 01:09:04.182
Okay.

01:09:04.892 --> 01:09:06.850
Here's your damn money.

01:09:07.645 --> 01:09:09.645
Now, where's my daughter?

01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:11.397
Yeah.

01:09:11.816 --> 01:09:14.692
You goddamn punk!

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:32.836
Who the fuck are you?

01:09:35.714 --> 01:09:37.465
Who the fuck are you?

01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:40.593
I got your damn money.
Now, where's my daughter?

01:09:41.554 --> 01:09:43.179
I am through fucking around!

01:09:43.264 --> 01:09:44.973
Drop that fucking briefcase!

01:09:45.057 --> 01:09:46.640
Where's my daughter?

01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:49.060
Fuck you, man!
Where's Jerry?

01:09:49.144 --> 01:09:51.479
I gave simple fucking instructions.

01:09:51.564 --> 01:09:53.273
Where's my damn daughter?

01:09:53.357 --> 01:09:54.649
No Jean, no money.

01:09:54.733 --> 01:09:56.651
Drop that fucking money!

01:09:56.735 --> 01:09:58.403
No Jean, no money!

01:10:00.197 --> 01:10:02.198
Is this a fucking joke here?

01:10:08.706 --> 01:10:12.166
Oh, jeez.

01:10:12.251 --> 01:10:14.335
You happy now, asshole?

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:16.087
What's with you people?

01:10:16.171 --> 01:10:18.047
You fucking imbeciles!

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:28.016
You fucking shot me!

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:47.220
May I have your ticket, please?

01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:49.013
Open the fucking gate!

01:12:28.554 --> 01:12:30.013
Oh, jeez.

01:13:00.252 --> 01:13:01.335
Dad?

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:02.503
Yeah?

01:13:02.963 --> 01:13:04.756
Stan Grossman called.

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.382
Yeah. Okay.

01:13:06.467 --> 01:13:07.467
Twice.

01:13:07.593 --> 01:13:08.593
Okay.

01:13:10.596 --> 01:13:12.305
Is everything okay?

01:13:12.681 --> 01:13:13.806
Yeah.

01:13:15.601 --> 01:13:17.351
Are you calling Stan?

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.105
Well, I'm...

01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:24.484
I'm going to bed now.

01:14:01.355 --> 01:14:02.522
How you doing?

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:04.232
- Mr. Mohra?
- Yeah?

01:14:04.566 --> 01:14:05.733
Officer Olson.

01:14:05.818 --> 01:14:07.318
Yeah. Righto.

01:14:08.153 --> 01:14:09.362
Well...

01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:12.615
So I'm tending bar down there at Ecklund 
and Swedlin's last Tuesday,

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:14.408
and this little guy's drinking,

01:14:14.493 --> 01:14:16.536
and he says,
"Where can a guy find some action?

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.871
"I'm going crazy out 
there at the lake."

01:14:18.956 --> 01:14:20.414
And I says,
"What kind of action?"

01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:22.708
And he says,
"Woman action. What do I look like?"

01:14:22.793 --> 01:14:24.252
And I says,
"Well, what do I look like?

01:14:24.336 --> 01:14:26.462
"I don't arrange that kind of thing."

01:14:26.547 --> 01:14:29.090
And he says,
"But I'm going crazy out there at the lake."

01:14:29.174 --> 01:14:32.426
And I says,
"Yeah, but this ain't that kind of place."

01:14:32.511 --> 01:14:35.972
He says, "Oh, so I get it.
So you think I'm some kind of jerk for asking."

01:14:36.056 --> 01:14:37.598
Only he don't use the word "jerk."

01:14:37.683 --> 01:14:39.267
I understand.
Then he calls me a jerk,

01:14:39.351 --> 01:14:41.769
says the last guy thought he's a jerk
is dead now.

01:14:41.854 --> 01:14:43.437
So, I don't say nothing.

01:14:43.522 --> 01:14:45.439
He says,
"What do you think about that?"

01:14:45.524 --> 01:14:48.943
And I says, "Well, that don't sound 
like too good a deal for him, then."

01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:50.069
You got that right.

01:14:50.154 --> 01:14:51.904
Yeah, he says,
"Yeah, that guy's dead,

01:14:51.989 --> 01:14:53.447
"and I don't mean of old age."

01:14:53.532 --> 01:14:57.076
And then he says,
"Jeez, I'm going crazy out there at the lake."

01:14:57.161 --> 01:14:58.161
White Bear Lake?

01:14:58.245 --> 01:15:00.705
Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

01:15:00.789 --> 01:15:01.956
So I made that assumption.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:02.999
Sure.

01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:04.876
Anyway, he's drinking at the bar,

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.669
so I don't think
a whole great deal of it,

01:15:06.753 --> 01:15:09.797
but then Mrs. Mohra,
she heard about the homicides down here

01:15:09.882 --> 01:15:14.010
and thought I should call it in,
so I called it in.

01:15:16.263 --> 01:15:17.805
End of story.

01:15:18.432 --> 01:15:19.891
Well, what'd this guy look like, anyways?

01:15:19.975 --> 01:15:21.559
Oh, he's a...

01:15:21.685 --> 01:15:23.269
Little guy,
kind of funny-looking.

01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:25.605
In what way?

01:15:25.689 --> 01:15:27.648
Just in a general kind of way.

01:15:27.733 --> 01:15:30.318
Okay. Well, thanks a bunch,
Mr. Mohra.

01:15:30.402 --> 01:15:32.111
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

01:15:32.196 --> 01:15:33.362
but thanks for calling her in.

01:15:33.447 --> 01:15:34.697
Sure.

01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:37.366
Looks like she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.

01:15:37.451 --> 01:15:39.744
Oh, yeah.
Got a front coming in.

01:15:39.912 --> 01:15:42.121
Yeah.
You got that right.

01:16:01.475 --> 01:16:02.892
Jesus Christ.

01:18:19.571 --> 01:18:22.990
Valerie, I'm leaving this morning,
back up to Brainerd.

01:18:23.075 --> 01:18:25.493
<i>Well, I'm sorry I won't see you.</i>

01:18:25.744 --> 01:18:26.994
But you think he's all right?

01:18:27.079 --> 01:18:28.204
I saw him last night and...

01:18:28.288 --> 01:18:29.330
<i>What did he say?</i>

01:18:29.414 --> 01:18:31.123
Well, it's nothing specific he said.

01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:34.377
It just seemed like it all hit him 
really hard, his wife dying.

01:18:34.461 --> 01:18:36.337
<i>- His wife?</i>
- Linda.

01:18:36.463 --> 01:18:38.464
<i>- Who?</i>
- Linda Cooksey.

01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:40.341
<i>No. No, no.
They weren't...</i>

01:18:40.425 --> 01:18:43.344
<i>He was bothering Linda for about...
For a good year.</i>

01:18:43.428 --> 01:18:46.555
<i>Really pestering her,
wouldn't leave her alone.</i>

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:48.140
So...

01:18:48.683 --> 01:18:50.142
He didn't...

01:18:50.685 --> 01:18:51.685
He never...

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:53.479
<i>No! No, they never married.</i>

01:18:53.563 --> 01:18:56.023
<i>Mike's had psychiatric problems.</i>

01:18:56.108 --> 01:18:57.525
Oh, my.

01:18:57.609 --> 01:18:59.110
<i>Yeah, he's been struggling.</i>

01:18:59.194 --> 01:19:01.529
<i>He's living with his parents now.</i>

01:19:02.697 --> 01:19:04.031
Oh, jeez.

01:19:04.116 --> 01:19:06.534
<i>Linda's fine.
You should call her.</i>

01:19:06.618 --> 01:19:08.160
Jeez. Well...

01:19:08.787 --> 01:19:09.912
Jeez.

01:19:11.623 --> 01:19:13.290
That's a surprise.

01:19:23.343 --> 01:19:24.510
Hello!

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:08.471
Mr. Lundegaard, sorry to bother you again.
Can I come in?

01:20:08.555 --> 01:20:11.599
Yeah... No.
I'm kind of busy here.

01:20:11.683 --> 01:20:14.185
I understand.
I'll keep it real short, then.

01:20:14.269 --> 01:20:17.104
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:18.397
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:20:18.482 --> 01:20:19.607
Carrying a bit of a load here.

01:20:19.691 --> 01:20:20.816
No, I...

01:20:20.901 --> 01:20:22.610
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

01:20:22.694 --> 01:20:23.736
I was just wondering...

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:26.947
Yeah, like I told you,
we haven't had any vehicles go missing.

01:20:27.032 --> 01:20:29.074
Okay. Are you sure?

01:20:30.076 --> 01:20:32.495
'Cause I mean, how do you know?

01:20:32.579 --> 01:20:34.246
Because, see,
the crime I'm investigating,

01:20:34.331 --> 01:20:36.499
the perpetrators were driving a car
with dealer plates,

01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:37.833
and they called someone who works here,

01:20:37.918 --> 01:20:39.585
so it'd be quite a coincidence
if they weren't,

01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:41.462
you know, connected.

01:20:42.088 --> 01:20:43.506
Yeah, I see.

01:20:43.673 --> 01:20:45.007
So, how do you...

01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:47.218
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

01:20:47.302 --> 01:20:48.969
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

01:20:49.054 --> 01:20:51.138
But how do you know that for sure
without doing a...

01:20:51.223 --> 01:20:52.890
Well, I would know.

01:20:53.058 --> 01:20:54.725
I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

01:20:54.809 --> 01:20:56.519
Yeah, but I understand...

01:20:56.603 --> 01:20:58.145
We run a pretty tight ship here.

01:20:58.230 --> 01:20:59.230
I know, but...

01:20:59.314 --> 01:21:01.357
Well, how do they establish that, sir?

01:21:01.441 --> 01:21:02.858
I mean, are the cars counted daily,

01:21:02.943 --> 01:21:04.818
or what kind of a routine here?

01:21:04.903 --> 01:21:07.363
Ma'am, I answered your question.

01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:12.701
I'm sorry, sir?

01:21:12.786 --> 01:21:15.079
Ma'am, I answered your question.

01:21:15.747 --> 01:21:16.830
I answered the darn...

01:21:16.915 --> 01:21:20.167
I'm cooperating here,
and there's no...

01:21:23.838 --> 01:21:26.674
Sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.

01:21:26.758 --> 01:21:28.300
I'm just doing my job here.

01:21:28.385 --> 01:21:29.552
I'm...

01:21:31.221 --> 01:21:34.473
I'm not...
I'm not arguing here.

01:21:34.558 --> 01:21:36.934
I'm cooperating, and there's no...

01:21:37.018 --> 01:21:39.103
We're doing all we can.

01:21:45.819 --> 01:21:48.612
Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

01:21:52.617 --> 01:21:54.118
Mr. Lundegaard.

01:21:57.330 --> 01:22:00.749
Well, heck! If you wanna...
If you wanna play games here,

01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:03.502
I'm working with you
on this thing here, but...

01:22:03.587 --> 01:22:06.505
Okay!
I'll do a damn lot count!

01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:07.673
Sir, right now?

01:22:07.757 --> 01:22:09.341
Yeah! Right now.

01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:11.802
You're darn tooting!

01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:15.681
If it's so damned important to you.

01:22:16.308 --> 01:22:18.017
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

01:22:18.101 --> 01:22:20.311
What the Christ! Jeez!

01:22:33.825 --> 01:22:36.660
<i>Bob Elcorona, line two.</i>

01:23:05.065 --> 01:23:06.857
For Pete's sake.

01:23:10.528 --> 01:23:12.446
For Pete's sake,
he's fleeing the interview.

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:14.698
He's fleeing the interview!

01:23:16.034 --> 01:23:18.452
How do I get an outside line here?

01:23:20.288 --> 01:23:21.538
All right.

01:23:24.793 --> 01:23:27.086
Yeah. Detective Sibert, please.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.548
<i>I told you it was over,
and I thought I made myself very clear.</i>

01:23:31.633 --> 01:23:34.426
<i>Oh, you did.
You made yourself perfectly clear.</i>

01:23:34.511 --> 01:23:36.387
<i>But something's come up.</i>

01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:37.930
<i>What?</i>

01:23:38.223 --> 01:23:39.556
<i>Well, it's something kind of small,</i>

01:23:39.641 --> 01:23:41.850
<i>but it might be a big problem.</i>

01:23:41.976 --> 01:23:43.477
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

01:23:45.063 --> 01:23:46.563
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.984
<i>I've had a doctor's test,
I've got the certificate,</i>

01:23:51.069 --> 01:23:54.571
<i>and there's no doubt about it,
I'm gonna have your baby.</i>

01:23:57.242 --> 01:23:59.702
<i>Now, look here.
I can explain this.</i>

01:23:59.869 --> 01:24:03.247
<i>See, Robin was...
Is a student of mine.</i>

01:24:04.165 --> 01:24:06.417
You should see the other guy.

01:24:07.001 --> 01:24:08.877
<i>No, no, no.
It wasn't anything like that.</i>

01:24:08.962 --> 01:24:10.087
<i>You don't understand!</i> 

01:24:10.171 --> 01:24:11.922
<i>I read that letter that she wrote.</i> 

01:24:12.006 --> 01:24:13.590
<i>I think I understand all there is...</i>

01:24:13.675 --> 01:24:15.426
What happened to her?

01:24:16.761 --> 01:24:19.388
She started shrieking, you know.

01:24:19.472 --> 01:24:20.597
Jeez.

01:24:21.349 --> 01:24:23.434
Well, I got the money.

01:24:23.935 --> 01:24:26.603
All of it, all 80 grand.

01:24:28.773 --> 01:24:31.483
That's 40 for you, 40 for me.

01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:35.154
That's it, then.

01:24:39.909 --> 01:24:41.410
You can have my truck.

01:24:41.536 --> 01:24:43.036
I'm taking the Cierra.

01:24:43.121 --> 01:24:44.621
We split that.

01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:50.002
How the fuck do you split 
a fucking car, you dummy?

01:24:50.295 --> 01:24:52.296
With a fucking chain saw?

01:24:52.547 --> 01:24:55.215
One of us pays the other for half.

01:24:55.467 --> 01:24:57.968
Hold on.
No fucking way.

01:24:58.845 --> 01:25:00.971
Did you fucking notice this?

01:25:01.806 --> 01:25:03.515
I got fucking shot!

01:25:03.892 --> 01:25:06.143
I got fucking shot in the face!

01:25:06.227 --> 01:25:07.770
I went and got the fucking money!

01:25:07.854 --> 01:25:09.605
I got shot fucking picking it up!

01:25:09.689 --> 01:25:12.399
I've been up for 36 fucking hours!

01:25:13.735 --> 01:25:15.194
I'm taking that fucking car!

01:25:15.278 --> 01:25:18.614
That fuck is mine,
you fucking asshole.

01:25:18.823 --> 01:25:22.117
You know, I've been listening 
to your fucking bullshit all week!

01:25:22.243 --> 01:25:23.744
Are we square?

01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.623
Are we square?

01:25:29.667 --> 01:25:31.543
Yeah, you fucking mute!

01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:35.547
And if you see your friend,
Shep Proudfoot,

01:25:35.632 --> 01:25:38.091
tell him I'm gonna nail his fucking ass.

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:42.471
<i>I'll call you...
Later.</i> 

01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:57.361
<i>His wife. This guy says 
she was kidnapped last Wednesday.</i>

01:25:57.445 --> 01:25:58.904
The day of our homicides.

01:25:58.988 --> 01:26:00.072
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:26:00.156 --> 01:26:01.448
And this guy was who?

01:26:01.533 --> 01:26:04.159
<i>Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.</i>

01:26:04.244 --> 01:26:05.911
Gustafson's accountant.

01:26:05.995 --> 01:26:07.120
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:26:07.205 --> 01:26:08.872
But we still haven't found Gustafson?

01:26:08.957 --> 01:26:10.666
<i>Looking...</i>

01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:12.459
Sorry. Didn't copy, Lou.

01:26:12.544 --> 01:26:14.127
<i>Still missing.
We're looking.</i>

01:26:14.212 --> 01:26:16.213
Copy. And Lundegaard, too?

01:26:16.422 --> 01:26:18.841
<i>Yeah.
Where are you, Margie?</i>

01:26:18.925 --> 01:26:20.092
I'm almost back.

01:26:20.176 --> 01:26:21.718
I'm taking a drive around Moose Lake.

01:26:21.803 --> 01:26:23.804
<i>Gary's loudmouth.</i>

01:26:24.097 --> 01:26:25.472
Yeah, the loudmouth.

01:26:25.557 --> 01:26:27.140
So the whole state has it, huh?

01:26:27.225 --> 01:26:29.059
Gustafson and Lundegaard?

01:26:29.143 --> 01:26:30.435
<i>Yeah. It's over the wire.</i>

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:31.895
<i>It's everywhere.
They'll find them.</i>

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:33.105
Copy. 

01:26:33.565 --> 01:26:34.690
<i>Yeah, we got a lead on this...</i>

01:26:34.774 --> 01:26:36.149
There's the car!
There's the car!

01:26:36.234 --> 01:26:37.234
<i>Whose car?</i>

01:26:37.318 --> 01:26:40.654
My car! My car!
Tan Cierra! Tan Cierra!

01:26:41.239 --> 01:26:44.241
<i>Okay. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple cars.</i>

01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:38.939
Police!

01:28:46.698 --> 01:28:48.281
Hands up!

01:28:48.574 --> 01:28:49.783
Police!

01:28:53.079 --> 01:28:54.371
Police!

01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:57.601
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there.

01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:06.234
And I guess that was your accomplice 
in the wood chipper.

01:30:10.907 --> 01:30:13.325
And those three people in Brainerd.

01:30:18.706 --> 01:30:20.165
And for what?

01:30:21.375 --> 01:30:23.418
For a little bit of money.

01:30:28.966 --> 01:30:32.219
There's more to life than a little money, 
you know?

01:30:41.854 --> 01:30:43.647
Don't you know that?

01:30:50.029 --> 01:30:51.780
And here you are.

01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:54.950
And it's a beautiful day.

01:31:04.293 --> 01:31:05.502
Well...

01:31:18.349 --> 01:31:20.433
I just don't understand it.

01:32:02.768 --> 01:32:04.227
Mr. Anderson?

01:32:05.563 --> 01:32:06.813
Who?

01:32:06.898 --> 01:32:10.317
Mr. Anderson, is this
your burgundy '98 out here?

01:32:11.736 --> 01:32:13.195
Just a sec.

01:32:13.279 --> 01:32:14.988
Could you open the door, please?

01:32:15.072 --> 01:32:16.990
Yeah, yeah, just a sec.

01:32:17.491 --> 01:32:18.867
Just a sec.

01:32:26.417 --> 01:32:28.376
- Dale!
- My leg!

01:32:28.461 --> 01:32:29.669
No!

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.627
They announced it.

01:33:12.213 --> 01:33:13.630
They announced it?

01:33:13.714 --> 01:33:14.839
Yeah.

01:33:15.341 --> 01:33:16.383
So?

01:33:17.385 --> 01:33:19.010
Three-cent stamp.

01:33:19.762 --> 01:33:21.221
Your mallard?

01:33:21.472 --> 01:33:22.514
Yeah.

01:33:23.391 --> 01:33:25.225
That's terrific.

01:33:25.309 --> 01:33:27.269
It's just a three-cent.

01:33:27.812 --> 01:33:28.895
It's terrific.

01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:31.690
Hautman's blue-winged teal
got the 29-cent.

01:33:32.316 --> 01:33:34.442
People don't much use the three-cent.

01:33:34.527 --> 01:33:37.112
Oh, for Pete's...
Of course they do.

01:33:38.322 --> 01:33:39.781
Whenever they raise the postage,

01:33:39.865 --> 01:33:41.741
people need the little stamps.

01:33:42.201 --> 01:33:43.576
Yeah?

01:33:43.661 --> 01:33:46.663
When they're stuck
with a bunch of the old ones.

01:33:46.747 --> 01:33:47.998
Yeah.

01:33:48.749 --> 01:33:50.125
I guess.

01:33:51.627 --> 01:33:54.754
That's terrific.
I'm so proud of you, Norm.

01:33:58.301 --> 01:34:01.303
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doing pretty good.

01:34:03.848 --> 01:34:05.640
I love you, Margie.

01:34:06.684 --> 01:34:08.310
I love you, Norm.

01:34:11.522 --> 01:34:13.148
Two more months.

01:34:16.717 --> 01:34:18.011
Two more months.
