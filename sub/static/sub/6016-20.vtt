WEBVTT

00:03.817 --> 00:05.045
A friend's getting married.

00:05.219 --> 00:08.677
The bachelor party and bridal shower
are the same day, so it's conceivable...

00:08.856 --> 00:10.653
...that while she's getting lingerie...

00:10.824 --> 00:13.725
...he'll be at a nude bar
watching a dancer in the same outfit.

00:14.795 --> 00:17.161
That is possible.

00:17.331 --> 00:19.492
But the difference between
single and married...

00:19.667 --> 00:21.032
...is the form of government.

00:21.201 --> 00:24.136
You see, when you're single
you're the dictator of your own life.

00:24.305 --> 00:25.465
I have complete power.

00:25.639 --> 00:28.904
When I give the order to fall asleep
on the sofa with the TV on...

00:29.076 --> 00:31.567
...no one can overrule me.

00:32.313 --> 00:36.306
When you're married you are part
of a vast decision-making body.

00:36.483 --> 00:38.383
Before anything's done,
there are meetings.

00:38.552 --> 00:40.452
Committees have to study
the situation.

00:40.621 --> 00:42.816
And this is if the marriage works.

00:42.990 --> 00:44.685
That's what so painful about divorce:

00:44.858 --> 00:47.292
You've been impeached.
You weren't even the president.

00:54.268 --> 00:57.032
Hey, is it my imagination,
or do really good-looking women...

00:57.204 --> 00:59.764
...walk a lot faster
than everybody else?

00:59.940 --> 01:01.874
We don't walk that fast.

01:02.042 --> 01:05.603
- No, seriously.
- Seriously, we don't.

01:07.081 --> 01:09.242
The better-looking they are,
the faster they go.

01:09.416 --> 01:11.316
I see them on the street
zooming around.

01:11.485 --> 01:14.283
They're a blur. It's like they got
a motor on their ass.

01:16.624 --> 01:19.821
Hey, Jerry, come on, let's go.
We're gonna miss the previews.

01:19.994 --> 01:21.222
What's the big hurry?

01:21.395 --> 01:23.955
How we getting to Scott Drake's
party on Saturday night?

01:24.131 --> 01:26.656
Oh, Drake's party.
I forgot to buy a present.

01:26.834 --> 01:28.301
What, I gotta buy a present now?

01:28.469 --> 01:30.403
Of course you do.
It's an engagement party.

01:30.571 --> 01:32.835
It never ends, this present stuff.

01:33.073 --> 01:34.938
Engagement present.
Then they get married.

01:35.109 --> 01:36.440
You gotta get them something.

01:36.610 --> 01:37.975
Then a baby. Another present.

01:38.145 --> 01:40.170
Then the baby starts getting
their presents.

01:40.347 --> 01:41.712
I don't even like Drake.

01:41.882 --> 01:43.611
- Don't like the Drake?
- Hate the Drake.

01:43.784 --> 01:46.218
- I love the Drake.
- How could you not like the Drake?

01:46.387 --> 01:48.480
- Who's the Drake?
- Who's the Drake?

01:48.656 --> 01:50.749
The Drake is good.

01:51.458 --> 01:52.857
So, what are you gonna get him?

01:53.027 --> 01:55.052
You know, I haven't even
met the fiancÃ©e.

01:55.229 --> 01:57.356
Oh, whatever!

01:58.732 --> 02:00.757
Elaine, look.
I drew this triangle freehand.

02:00.934 --> 02:03.266
It's a doodle. It's perfect.

02:04.304 --> 02:05.737
So what? That's easy.

02:05.906 --> 02:07.498
Easy?

02:12.780 --> 02:15.715
Hi. Hey, have you gotten
a present yet for the Drake?

02:15.883 --> 02:17.783
- No, no, not yet.
- You like the Drake?

02:17.951 --> 02:19.851
I love the Drake.

02:20.487 --> 02:22.785
I'm looking forward to meeting
the "Drakette."

02:22.956 --> 02:24.890
I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.

02:25.059 --> 02:27.789
Boy, that's a nice triangle.

02:29.063 --> 02:31.395
It's isosceles.

02:31.732 --> 02:34.633
Isosceles. You know,
I love the name "Isosceles."

02:34.802 --> 02:37.532
If I had a kid, I would
name him Isosceles.

02:37.705 --> 02:40.469
Isosceles Kramer.

02:40.841 --> 02:43.742
Hey, you know what, maybe
we should all chip in for the gift.

02:43.911 --> 02:46.004
- The chip-in.
- Hey, pretty good idea?

02:46.180 --> 02:48.307
- Yeah.
- The chip-in. Definitely.

02:48.482 --> 02:50.973
Let's go to that mall in Lynbrook
before the party.

02:51.151 --> 02:54.450
- We'll take your car. It's got room.
- No, no. My car's not running.

02:55.055 --> 02:56.386
What about your father's car?

02:56.557 --> 02:58.718
No. Out of the question.
I was over there today.

02:58.892 --> 03:01.258
He's got the good spot
in front of the good building.

03:01.428 --> 03:03.896
I know he's not gonna
want to move.

03:04.064 --> 03:06.658
- Are you serious?
- You don't know what it means to him.

03:06.834 --> 03:09.803
Once he gets it, he doesn't
go out for weeks.

03:10.037 --> 03:12.232
How about this:
You put your car in the good spot.

03:12.406 --> 03:15.102
That'll hold the good spot,
and we can get the good car.

03:15.275 --> 03:17.766
- Good thinking.
- Good to meet you.

03:18.479 --> 03:22.006
- So, what are we gonna get him?
- Anything we want. We're chipping in.

03:22.182 --> 03:24.343
I like this area. I could live out here.

03:24.518 --> 03:27.248
Yeah, we ought to all get a house
and live together out here.

03:27.421 --> 03:29.446
That's a good idea.
Tell you what, chuckles...

03:29.623 --> 03:32.353
...l'll give you permission
to sublet my room right now.

03:32.893 --> 03:34.861
Look at this.
There's no spaces here.

03:35.529 --> 03:37.190
- Excuse me. You getting out?
- No.

03:37.631 --> 03:39.963
Why don't you take
the handicapped spot?

03:40.968 --> 03:43.163
- You think?
- No, no. We'll find a space.

03:43.337 --> 03:46.170
- There's spaces in the other lot.
- I don't wanna walk that far.

03:46.340 --> 03:48.365
What if a handicapped person
needs it?

03:48.542 --> 03:51.170
- No, come on, they don't drive.
- Yes, they do.

03:51.478 --> 03:54.970
Have you ever seen a handicapped
person pull into a space and park?

03:55.249 --> 03:56.876
The space is there,
they must drive.

03:57.050 --> 04:00.349
No, they don't. If they could drive,
they wouldn't be handicapped.

04:00.521 --> 04:02.853
So if you can drive,
you're not handicapped?

04:03.023 --> 04:05.355
We're not gonna be long.
We gotta get to the party.

04:05.526 --> 04:08.620
I got news for you: Handicapped
people don't even want to park there.

04:08.796 --> 04:10.957
They want to be treated
just like everybody else.

04:11.131 --> 04:12.996
That's why those spaces
are always empty.

04:13.167 --> 04:15.761
He's right. It's the same thing
with the feminists.

04:15.936 --> 04:17.995
They want everything to be equal.
Everything.

04:18.172 --> 04:20.163
But when the check comes,
where are they?

04:21.774 --> 04:23.766
What does that mean?

04:24.411 --> 04:25.708
Yeah.

04:25.879 --> 04:27.904
- All right, I'm pulling in.
- Go ahead, George.

04:28.081 --> 04:31.448
- George!
- Come on. It's five minutes.

04:33.420 --> 04:35.047
Don't forget where
the car is parked.

04:35.222 --> 04:37.690
- Don't worry.
- We'll remember.

04:40.694 --> 04:42.423
Do you believe the deal
we got on this?

04:42.596 --> 04:45.326
- A big-screen TV at that price?
- What a sale, huh?

04:45.499 --> 04:47.933
And how about that store
delivering it tonight.

04:48.101 --> 04:49.796
We're gonna be swimming
in thank-yous.

04:49.970 --> 04:51.437
Why did I get the veggieburger?

04:51.605 --> 04:54.938
You got a veggieburger, so I got one.
It's like eating a loaf of crumbs.

04:55.108 --> 04:57.668
No one's gonna have a better gift
than this big-screen TV.

04:57.845 --> 04:59.574
Good for them. Love the Drake.

04:59.746 --> 05:03.182
Got to love the Drake.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.751
Hey, what's going on over here?

05:08.922 --> 05:10.446
There must have been an accident.

05:13.760 --> 05:14.784
What's going on?

05:14.962 --> 05:17.226
Some jerk parked
in the handicapped spot...

05:17.397 --> 05:20.230
...so this woman in a wheelchair
had to wheel up this incline.

05:20.400 --> 05:24.530
Halfway up, her batteries gave out,
and she rolled backwards into the wall.

05:25.138 --> 05:26.935
Had to take her to Saint Elizabeth's.

05:27.107 --> 05:28.734
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

05:28.909 --> 05:31.377
We're just waiting for the owner
of this car to show up.

05:31.545 --> 05:33.445
He may not get out alive.

05:33.614 --> 05:37.141
Taking up a handicapped spot.
He's gonna pay.

05:37.317 --> 05:39.877
Sons of bitches.

05:40.053 --> 05:43.420
Well, good luck finding them.
Him. Whatever.

05:43.590 --> 05:46.718
I'd like to get my hands on him myself,
but I gotta take off.

05:46.894 --> 05:48.486
We're gonna get you, you coward!

05:50.264 --> 05:53.028
- They'll kill us.
- You happy? Are you happy now?

05:53.200 --> 05:55.361
- How long you think they'll be here?
- Don't know.

05:55.535 --> 05:56.934
What about the party,
the Drake?

05:57.104 --> 05:59.197
- Oh, screw the Drake!
- I love the Drake.

05:59.373 --> 06:01.204
Let's just take a bus
back into the city.

06:01.375 --> 06:02.637
I can't leave the car here.

06:02.809 --> 06:05.141
- Why not?
- It's my father's car.

06:05.312 --> 06:07.143
- Let's smash it!
- Yeah!

06:07.314 --> 06:09.407
Hey, hey! Leave the car alone!

06:09.583 --> 06:12.916
All right, let's get out of here.
We gotta figure something out.

06:14.154 --> 06:16.145
What are we gonna do?
How will we get out?

06:16.323 --> 06:18.450
Even if we go to the car
and they're not there...

06:18.625 --> 06:20.252
...how do we know
they're not hiding?

06:20.427 --> 06:23.590
They have to give up some time.
They can't stay out there all night.

06:23.764 --> 06:25.322
What are we, John Dillinger?

06:25.499 --> 06:27.797
How did this get to be
the crime of the century?

06:27.968 --> 06:31.597
It's not like we stuck a broomstick
in her spokes and she went flying.

06:32.572 --> 06:35.234
What I don't get is, just because
the batteries went dead...

06:35.409 --> 06:38.435
...you'd think she'd be able to
roll it up the hill with her hands.

06:38.612 --> 06:39.840
You'd think.

06:40.013 --> 06:42.447
Batteries have gone dead before.
Aren't they prepared?

06:42.616 --> 06:44.811
You know, most of them
don't even have batteries.

06:44.985 --> 06:47.317
Must have been a rich, spoiled
handicapped person...

06:47.487 --> 06:49.114
...who didn't want to do any work.

06:49.289 --> 06:51.780
Just wanted to sit in her wheelchair
and take it easy.

06:51.959 --> 06:54.223
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm sorry.

06:54.394 --> 06:57.363
Our big-screen TV is probably
arriving just about now.

06:57.531 --> 06:59.123
How we getting out?
We need a plan.

06:59.399 --> 07:01.959
I got it. We'll give the keys to Elaine.

07:02.135 --> 07:03.727
- Me?
- Yeah.

07:03.904 --> 07:06.304
You're a woman.
Men won't hit a woman.

07:06.473 --> 07:08.065
Oh, they won't?

07:08.241 --> 07:10.334
Not if they don't know you.

07:10.744 --> 07:12.644
I'm not going for this.
Kramer should go.

07:12.813 --> 07:14.178
You know, it was all his idea.

07:14.348 --> 07:16.316
No chance in hell.

07:16.483 --> 07:18.348
What if we created
some sort of diversion?

07:18.518 --> 07:20.418
What if we went over
and started screaming:

07:20.587 --> 07:22.953
"There's the guy that took
the handicapped spot."

07:23.123 --> 07:25.648
When they run the other direction,
we'll jump in the car.

07:25.826 --> 07:27.384
- That's good.
- Let's give it a try.

07:27.561 --> 07:30.029
If that doesn't work,
we'll give them Kramer.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.074

07:46.213 --> 07:48.238
Oh, my God.

08:04.464 --> 08:07.592
You know, a lot of these scratches
will buff right out.

08:12.672 --> 08:15.869
Eight years I had that car,
not a scratch on it.

08:16.043 --> 08:17.533
Eight years.

08:17.711 --> 08:19.736
- Two crack.
- Three dot.

08:19.913 --> 08:23.747
Beautiful Mercury.
I special ordered that bench seat.

08:23.917 --> 08:26.477
Dad, this other car cut us off.

08:26.653 --> 08:29.213
They had swastikas all over it.

08:29.389 --> 08:32.414
They were hurling
racial epithets at us.

08:32.592 --> 08:35.424
- I could have been killed.
- I told you not to give it to him.

08:35.595 --> 08:38.188
- Three crack.
- Four bam.

08:38.365 --> 08:40.890
You know, my insurance
doesn't even cover this.

08:41.068 --> 08:42.558
The whole thing is a total loss.

08:42.736 --> 08:44.829
The important thing
is he didn't get hurt.

08:45.005 --> 08:46.563
No, it isn't.

08:48.308 --> 08:49.969
So, what are you doing now,
Georgie?

08:50.143 --> 08:54.239
- North.
- I'm writing a pilot for NBC.

08:54.414 --> 08:56.974
- Where the hell's my paper?
- You're writing a pilot?

08:57.150 --> 09:00.176
With his friend Jerry Seinfeld,
the comedian.

09:00.353 --> 09:01.843
So, what's it about?

09:02.556 --> 09:07.425
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other
driver doesn't have any insurance...

09:07.594 --> 09:09.994
...so the judge sentences him
to be Jerry's butler.

09:10.163 --> 09:12.188
- It's the same situation.
- Exactly.

09:12.365 --> 09:14.833
Frank, maybe you ought to
make him your butler.

09:16.236 --> 09:17.828
Flower.

09:18.004 --> 09:21.496
Every time you're with that Kramer
something happens.

09:21.675 --> 09:24.838
- He's a real troublemaker.
- He didn't have anything to do with it.

09:25.011 --> 09:27.445
He's all together crazy, that one.

09:27.614 --> 09:30.777
And Jerry I used to think was nice.

09:30.951 --> 09:33.647
I don't know what happened to him.
Nine bam.

09:33.820 --> 09:35.617
- One dot.
- Two crack.

09:35.789 --> 09:38.121
- Three bam.
- Mahjongg.

09:40.460 --> 09:41.791
So it was a good party, huh?

09:41.962 --> 09:45.022
You're welcome. You're welcome.
They loved the TV. Loved it.

09:45.198 --> 09:46.426
Yeah.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.329
Wait. I'll ask her.
That's a great idea.

09:48.502 --> 09:51.835
Drake wants to know if we'll come out
to Mineola since we missed the party.

09:52.005 --> 09:53.336
- Get something to eat.
- Sure.

09:53.507 --> 09:55.532
Sure. Okay.

09:55.709 --> 09:57.700
Don't worry, I'm taking my car.

09:58.211 --> 10:00.645
Okay. All right,
we'll see you later. Bye.

10:00.814 --> 10:02.076
The Drake is great.

10:02.649 --> 10:05.311
He's so nice.
Man, I'm really happy for them.

10:05.485 --> 10:07.544
Yeah. Well, I don't know
if I'm happy for them.

10:07.721 --> 10:11.157
I'm glad they're happy, but frankly
it doesn't do anything for me.

10:15.262 --> 10:16.559
- Yes?
- It's me.

10:16.730 --> 10:18.561
Come on up.

10:20.066 --> 10:21.658
Hey.

10:24.771 --> 10:26.398
I just came from Saint Elizabeth's.

10:26.573 --> 10:28.200
Saint Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?

10:28.775 --> 10:31.369
Well, the handicapped woman,
I went to see her.

10:31.545 --> 10:32.944
- You went to see her?
- Yeah.

10:33.113 --> 10:34.910
Wow, what happened?

10:35.081 --> 10:37.208
I'm in love.

10:39.286 --> 10:40.514
- What?
- Yeah.

10:40.687 --> 10:43.713
She is the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

10:43.890 --> 10:45.915
I love her, Jerry.
I mean, I really love her.

10:46.092 --> 10:47.684
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

10:47.861 --> 10:51.194
She's got everything I've always
wanted in another human being.

10:51.364 --> 10:53.423
Except for the walking.

10:55.502 --> 10:58.232
What's the difference.
You don't go out that much.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.405
- I'm glad you're here.
- Why?

11:01.575 --> 11:03.600
We gotta go out,
we gotta buy a wheelchair.

11:03.777 --> 11:05.039
A wheelchair? What for?

11:05.212 --> 11:07.237
I went to the hospital today.
I saw the woman.

11:07.414 --> 11:09.939
The wheelchair is totaled.
We gotta get her another one.

11:10.617 --> 11:11.879
Doesn't she have collision?

11:12.052 --> 11:15.317
George, I'm in love with her.

11:16.156 --> 11:18.351
Look, my father works
for the United Volunteers.

11:18.525 --> 11:20.925
- Maybe he can get her one.
- No. She needs it now.

11:21.094 --> 11:23.392
What about these two?
Aren't they gonna chip in?

11:23.563 --> 11:25.656
Hey, we told you not to park there.

11:25.832 --> 11:27.424
Can't we just fix the old one?

11:27.601 --> 11:30.092
All right, all right.
Fine, George, don't chip in.

11:30.270 --> 11:31.965
But some day we'll be
driving along...

11:32.138 --> 11:35.574
...we're gonna look out the window,
see her crawling along Fifth Avenue.

11:35.742 --> 11:38.802
- Is that what you want?
- All right! All right!

11:38.979 --> 11:40.970
We'll buy a wheelchair.

11:41.147 --> 11:45.277
Wheelchairs. Engagement presents.
It never ends!

11:49.623 --> 11:52.387
This is our best model,
the Cougar 9000.

11:52.559 --> 11:54.925
It's the Rolls-Royce
of wheelchairs.

11:55.795 --> 12:00.323
This is like you're almost glad
to be handicapped.

12:03.737 --> 12:05.432
So, now, what's this got?

12:05.605 --> 12:09.132
It's got inductive joystick,
dynamic braking, flip-up arms.

12:09.309 --> 12:10.537
It's fully loaded.

12:11.111 --> 12:15.104
I put Stephen Hawking in one of these
two months ago, he's loving it.

12:16.016 --> 12:19.281
It's rated number one by Hospital
Supply and Prosthetic Magazine.

12:19.452 --> 12:22.319
- How much?
- Sixty-two hundred.

12:23.590 --> 12:26.684
Do you have something
a little more...

12:26.860 --> 12:28.919
...less expensive?

12:31.798 --> 12:34.699
- Hi! How you doing?
- Hey, Drake.

12:34.868 --> 12:36.665
- Hi, Drake!
- Hi, Allison.

12:36.836 --> 12:38.565
There's the TV.
Elaine, look at this.

12:38.738 --> 12:40.501
Oh, my God, this is fantastic.

12:40.674 --> 12:43.336
So tell me, were you guys
just blown away or what?

12:43.510 --> 12:45.876
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's fantastic.

12:46.046 --> 12:48.071
I am gonna make good use of this.

12:48.248 --> 12:52.150
I'm watching every Super Bowl here.
Every big fight.

12:52.319 --> 12:56.312
Oh, man, there is nothing
like a really big TV, huh?

12:56.489 --> 12:58.320
So, where are we eating?

12:58.491 --> 13:02.222
- Well, actually, Jerry...
- I'm really hungry.

13:02.395 --> 13:04.260
We just broke up.

13:14.574 --> 13:18.237
- When did this happen?
- About 20 minutes ago.

13:22.415 --> 13:25.680
Hey, I am really sorry
about this, guys.

13:29.055 --> 13:31.853
- Hell of a picture on this thing.
- Crystal clear.

13:34.194 --> 13:35.525
They know how to make them.

13:37.664 --> 13:39.188
Drake?

13:39.599 --> 13:42.659
Are there any good Italian restaurants
around here?

13:43.870 --> 13:47.601
Gagliano's. That's pretty good.

13:48.608 --> 13:50.872
- Well, we should...
- Get moving. Yeah.

13:51.044 --> 13:54.275
Hey, Drake, whatever happens,
I'm sure it'll be for the best.

13:54.447 --> 13:57.939
Yeah. Take it easy.
Bye-bye, Allison.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.985
The remote.

14:03.790 --> 14:08.124
Okay, I'm just gonna put it
on top of the television...

14:08.294 --> 14:10.626
Oh, God!

14:13.400 --> 14:16.164
This one's about 8 years old.
Not a scratch on it.

14:16.336 --> 14:17.598
It was owned by some lady...

14:17.771 --> 14:20.262
...who only used it to go
to the kitchen to feed her cats.

14:20.807 --> 14:22.672
- But this will get you around?
- Oh, sure.

14:22.842 --> 14:25.242
It just doesn't have any of the frills
of the Cougar.

14:25.412 --> 14:27.972
- Like what?
- For example, your tremor-damping.

14:28.148 --> 14:31.015
- Now, what's that?
- It helps to control the direction...

14:31.184 --> 14:33.982
...regardless of the operator's tremors
or "spasticity."

14:34.154 --> 14:36.782
- Well, is it all right if I try it?
- Hop in.

14:38.224 --> 14:40.249
Oh, yeah.

14:42.328 --> 14:44.319
I tell you...

14:44.898 --> 14:48.664
...when I see someone
enjoying themselves like that...

14:48.835 --> 14:51.895
...it reminds me of why I got
into this business in the first place.

14:52.071 --> 14:53.936
How much?

14:54.107 --> 14:56.302
How about $240?

14:56.843 --> 14:58.333
- We'll take it.
- We'll take it.

15:00.513 --> 15:04.609
- Drake gave her the TV?
- Gave her all the gifts. He felt guilty.

15:04.984 --> 15:08.112
Well, she can't keep it.
It's not fair. That's our TV.

15:08.288 --> 15:10.188
I know it is!

15:12.425 --> 15:15.053
Boy, I'm really starting to
dislike the Drake.

15:15.395 --> 15:17.295
Hate the Drake!

15:18.264 --> 15:20.129
Maybe the whole thing
was a scam.

15:20.433 --> 15:23.027
Anybody can just get engaged,
get presents, and keep them.

15:23.203 --> 15:26.604
Maybe they're on the way to Chicago
to do the whole thing all over again.

15:27.540 --> 15:29.167
They don't know anybody in Chicago.

15:29.342 --> 15:33.335
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast
with that nice TV.

15:34.914 --> 15:36.381
- Hey.
- Hey. Guess what?

15:36.549 --> 15:37.811
The Drake broke up.

15:38.151 --> 15:39.982
The Drake broke up!

15:40.153 --> 15:41.677
That's fantastic!

15:41.855 --> 15:45.018
We'll get the TV back. Help defray
some of the cost of the wheelchair.

15:45.191 --> 15:47.989
- I don't know about defraying.
- Why?

15:48.161 --> 15:50.391
We're not getting that TV.

15:50.563 --> 15:52.690
What? The engagement's off.
We get the TV back.

15:52.866 --> 15:54.094
That's business.

15:54.267 --> 15:56.064
The Drakette took it.

15:56.236 --> 15:58.101
She can't take it.

15:58.271 --> 15:59.898
It's not hers. It's theirs.

16:00.073 --> 16:03.531
Once there's no theirs,
there's no hers. It should be ours.

16:04.077 --> 16:05.544
Well, she has it.

16:06.479 --> 16:09.846
I told you the Drake was bad.
I hate the Drake!

16:12.085 --> 16:13.177
Maybe we should call her.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.318
- Oh, come on. Who's gonna call?
- You are.

16:16.489 --> 16:19.356
What? Why is it me who
always has to do these things?

16:19.526 --> 16:21.619
Because that's your thing.

16:21.794 --> 16:23.193
Calling people I hardly know...

16:23.363 --> 16:25.456
...and demanding they return
expensive gifts?

16:25.632 --> 16:27.224
That's my thing?

16:28.301 --> 16:30.166
Yeah, that's your thing.

16:32.171 --> 16:34.662
All right. Give me the phone.

16:35.542 --> 16:37.942
That's my thing.

16:41.481 --> 16:44.143
You know, I'm thinking
about getting a yo-yo.

16:44.551 --> 16:45.950
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:46.119 --> 16:48.053
I could see that.

16:50.690 --> 16:54.353
- Hello?
- Allison. Hi, this is Elaine.

16:54.527 --> 16:56.495
I gave all the gifts to charity.

16:56.663 --> 16:59.655
Oh, okay. Well, thanks a lot.

16:59.832 --> 17:01.527
Sorry again about you
and the Drake.

17:01.701 --> 17:04.329
- I hate the Drake.
- Everybody does.

17:04.503 --> 17:06.563
Bye-bye.

17:06.739 --> 17:11.506
- She gave it to charity.
- Charity? That's appalling.

17:12.011 --> 17:15.446
How could anybody be
so selfish and inconsiderate.

17:16.348 --> 17:18.681
Hey. Well, I gave her
the wheelchair.

17:18.851 --> 17:20.819
You should have seen
the look on her face.

17:20.987 --> 17:24.479
Then she told me the old wheelchair
wasn't any good anyway.

17:24.656 --> 17:29.219
So you see, George, the whole
incident was a God blessing. Yeah.

17:30.463 --> 17:34.194
- You mean a blessing in disguise?
- Yeah.

17:36.269 --> 17:38.066
I would also like to
take this time...

17:38.237 --> 17:42.196
...to personally thank
our gracious host, Frank Costanza...

17:42.408 --> 17:46.401
...who earned the Silver Circle Award
and is our unanimous choice...

17:46.579 --> 17:49.810
...for the United Volunteer
representative of the month.

17:50.450 --> 17:55.888
Due to his tireless effort, he has
personally raised over $22,000.

17:56.055 --> 17:58.615
And that's a lot of wheelchairs.

18:00.960 --> 18:04.521
On behalf of the United Volunteers
of New York, we thank you.

18:04.697 --> 18:07.063
Thank you very much.

18:07.233 --> 18:08.700
Mr. Costanza?

18:08.868 --> 18:10.699
- Yes?
- You're under arrest.

18:10.870 --> 18:12.497
Under arrest? What for?

18:12.672 --> 18:15.140
Reckless endangerment
of public safety...

18:15.308 --> 18:18.300
...in violation of traffic code 342-A.

18:19.245 --> 18:23.306
- What's that?
- Parking in a handicap spot.

18:23.716 --> 18:25.308
Let's go.

18:25.485 --> 18:27.817
George! George!

18:30.390 --> 18:33.018
Your father got arrested.
For what?

18:33.192 --> 18:35.717
Parking in a handicapped spot.

18:35.895 --> 18:39.160
Right in the middle
of his United Volunteer's meeting.

18:39.332 --> 18:42.824
When he got back, he chased
after me with a baseball bat.

18:43.569 --> 18:44.900
Holy...

18:45.071 --> 18:48.006
Between the car being totaled,
the towing charge and the fine...

18:48.174 --> 18:50.108
...there's no way I could ever
pay him back.

18:50.276 --> 18:51.607
So, what are you gonna do?

18:52.345 --> 18:54.813
I agreed to become his butler.

18:56.716 --> 18:58.013
What?

19:00.153 --> 19:02.587
- What's the matter?
- It's over.

19:03.756 --> 19:07.351
- What's over?
- Me and Lola.

19:07.927 --> 19:10.122
- Who we bought the wheelchair for?
- She dumped me.

19:10.296 --> 19:11.854
- She dumped you?
- She dumped me.

19:12.031 --> 19:14.295
She rolled right over me.

19:16.469 --> 19:19.597
Said I was a hipster doofus.

19:19.772 --> 19:21.433
Am I a hipster doofus?

19:22.141 --> 19:23.403
- No.
- No.

19:23.576 --> 19:25.168
Said I'm not good-looking enough.

19:25.344 --> 19:28.802
Not good-looking.
Jerry, look at me. Look at my face.

19:28.981 --> 19:31.950
Am I beautiful?
George, am I beautiful?

19:35.688 --> 19:38.316
- You're very attractive.
- Yeah.

19:38.491 --> 19:41.654
She says she doesn't want to
see me again. Told me to drop dead!

19:41.828 --> 19:45.389
- Drop dead.
- Boy, even I never heard that one.

19:45.565 --> 19:47.396
She's pretty rough.

19:47.567 --> 19:51.333
Well, we just blew
$240 on a wheelchair.

19:51.504 --> 19:55.270
- $240 bucks?
- Well, it was slightly used.

19:55.441 --> 19:57.466
Used?

20:08.054 --> 20:10.887
I don't think you did
such a good job on these.

20:13.826 --> 20:15.987
- What?
- Supposed to see your face there.

20:17.263 --> 20:19.493
Do you see your face in there?

20:24.237 --> 20:25.602
Yeah.

20:27.039 --> 20:29.473
Oh, really?

20:31.344 --> 20:34.006
How about that.
Went right down a hill?

20:34.514 --> 20:38.280
Okay. All right. Bye.

20:38.451 --> 20:41.852
George, forget about the shoes.
I want you to do something for me.

20:42.021 --> 20:44.683
This handicapped woman
had an accident.

20:44.857 --> 20:48.657
Somebody gave her a used wheelchair
with defective brakes.

20:48.828 --> 20:50.989
Sons of bitches!

20:51.164 --> 20:54.133
Pick up this big-screen TV
and deliver it to her.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.666
- Big-screen TV.
- You think you can handle it?

21:00.907 --> 21:04.308
- Yes?
- Hi, we're from the United Volunteers.

21:04.477 --> 21:06.342
We've come to pick up the TV.

21:06.512 --> 21:08.742
Great, it's right over there.

21:08.915 --> 21:10.746
It's a big one.

21:16.656 --> 21:19.090
- Who's got the receipt?
- I do.

21:19.258 --> 21:21.783
- Will they give us cash?
- That's their policy.

21:21.961 --> 21:24.987
I hate this mall. There are never
any spaces here.

21:25.164 --> 21:27.189
Why don't you park
in front of the hydrant?

21:27.366 --> 21:31.735
- What if there's a fire?
- Now what are the chances of that?

21:42.381 --> 21:47.717
The handicapped parking spot
is the mirage of the parking desert.

21:47.887 --> 21:50.617
Do you know that feeling?
You see it there in the distance.

21:50.790 --> 21:53.224
You can't believe your eyes.
It's too good to be true.

21:53.392 --> 21:55.053
It's a big wide spot
by the entrance.

21:55.228 --> 21:57.594
Somehow everybody missed it.

22:01.601 --> 22:07.562
What is the handicapped parking
situation at the Special Olympics?

22:10.409 --> 22:15.210
They must have to just stack, like,
a hundred cars into those two spots.

22:15.381 --> 22:17.906
How else are they gonna do it?

22:18.305 --> 22:24.552
