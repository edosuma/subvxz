00:04.212 --> 00:07.005
This is what all
of human history is about,

00:07.006 --> 00:10.801
this present moment
where we migrate into space.

00:10.802 --> 00:14.930
NARRATOR: It's a special
two-hour Ancient Aliens event.

00:14.931 --> 00:17.182
JOSH RICHARDS: This is very much
about humanity setting up

00:17.183 --> 00:19.893
a permanent outpost
on another planet.

00:19.894 --> 00:23.063
MICHIO KAKU: Either we prepare
to leave the Earth,

00:23.064 --> 00:25.274
or we prepare to die.

00:25.275 --> 00:29.862
NARRATOR: When humans become the
alien visitors on other planets,

00:29.863 --> 00:33.323
what, or whom,
will they encounter?

00:33.324 --> 00:36.368
What if we arrive on Mars,

00:36.369 --> 00:39.747
and there are
artificial structures?

00:39.748 --> 00:42.291
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
There is alien intelligence,

00:42.292 --> 00:44.334
and our government
knows about it.

00:44.335 --> 00:48.881
And that has to break out if
we're going to go beyond Earth.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.967
NARRATOR: As a new generation
of astronauts

00:51.968 --> 00:54.928
prepares for life
on other worlds,

00:54.929 --> 00:58.891
are they simply realizing
mankind's future,

00:58.892 --> 01:03.520
or returning
to its extraterrestrial past?

01:03.521 --> 01:05.814
HENRY:
We're very near a discovery

01:05.815 --> 01:08.525
where we're gonna understand
that everything

01:08.526 --> 01:12.613
that ancient astronaut theorists
have been talking about is true.

NARRATOR:
The Mojave Desert, California.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.941
May 29, 2018.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.110
Virgin Galactic's
SpaceShipTwo Unity

01:52.111 --> 01:54.863
lifts off from
the Mojave Air and Space Port

01:54.864 --> 01:59.409
under the power of a carrier jet
named VMS Eve.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.829
PILOT 1:
Three, two, one. Release.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.164
NARRATOR:
At 50,000 feet above the Earth,

02:04.165 --> 02:06.625
the Unity is dropped

02:06.626 --> 02:09.086
from its mother ship
and rockets upward

02:09.086 --> 02:13.715
to an altitude of 114,500 feet,

02:13.716 --> 02:16.260
before descending back to Earth.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.428
- (applause)
- The Unity is the brainchild

02:18.429 --> 02:22.641
of billionaire entrepreneur
Richard Branson.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.978
It represents a new era
in space exploration,

02:25.979 --> 02:29.982
as it is designed to carry
not only astronauts,

02:29.983 --> 02:33.610
but civilians.

02:33.611 --> 02:37.614
Right now is an amazing time
to see what's happening

02:37.615 --> 02:40.450
with the world's
space exploration.

02:40.451 --> 02:44.955
You have commercial entities
that are building rockets

02:44.956 --> 02:47.124
that we're actually using
to get to the Space Station,

02:47.125 --> 02:49.918
and maybe even to Mars
in the very near future.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.713
We've got people talking about
putting colonies on the Moon

02:52.714 --> 02:54.840
and on Mars.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.676
And we also are now
talking about a Space Force

02:57.677 --> 03:00.888
that's very similar to what you
might have heard in the old days

03:00.889 --> 03:03.015
of, uh, like the
Starfleet Academy in Star Trek

03:03.016 --> 03:04.975
and other
science fiction stories.

03:04.976 --> 03:09.438
Within a few short generations,
we're likely to have people

03:09.439 --> 03:11.607
that are being born as Martians.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.860
We will soon be the Martians.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.112
So we are really reaching
a point where

03:17.113 --> 03:21.910
space is right there, right
for us to reach out and grab.

03:25.079 --> 03:28.540
NARRATOR: Today, a new
21st-century space race

03:28.541 --> 03:32.169
has captured mankind's
collective imagination.

03:32.170 --> 03:36.506
Not since the Apollo program's
history-making Moon landings

03:36.507 --> 03:39.801
has there been such interest in
and hope for

03:39.802 --> 03:42.930
a return to manned missions
to explore other places

03:42.931 --> 03:45.641
in our solar system.

03:45.642 --> 03:50.562
Although only the United States,
Russia and China

03:50.563 --> 03:52.981
currently have human
space flight capabilities,

03:52.982 --> 03:55.233
dozens of other nations,

03:55.234 --> 03:57.945
in addition to
well-funded corporations,

03:57.946 --> 03:59.947
are committing
unprecedented resources

03:59.948 --> 04:02.158
to join this exclusive club.

04:04.494 --> 04:08.121
I'm old enough to remember
that first small step

04:08.122 --> 04:09.915
that Neil Armstrong took.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.876
And, at the time, I think
we all believed it was

04:12.877 --> 04:15.837
the first step on a stairway
to the stars.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.673
NEIL ARMSTRONG (over comm):
That's one small step for man,

04:18.675 --> 04:22.636
one giant leap for mankind.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.346
DAVIES:
And then, after a few years,

04:24.347 --> 04:28.266
everything seemed to stall,
people lost interest.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.352
What we're seeing
in recent years

04:30.353 --> 04:33.563
is other nations
getting into this, and so--

04:33.564 --> 04:36.024
particularly China,
and also India--

04:36.025 --> 04:38.110
with the prospect that we'll be
blazing a new trail

04:38.111 --> 04:40.570
to the stars.

04:40.571 --> 04:44.908
KAKU: We're entering the second
golden age of space exploration.

04:44.909 --> 04:49.246
Even Silicon Valley billionaires
are jumping into the game,

04:49.247 --> 04:52.082
funding their own fleet
of rockets.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.334
FLIGHT DIRECTOR:
...NTS is ready for launch.

04:54.335 --> 04:57.796
- (crowd cheering)
- WOMAN: There's Falcon Heavy.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.717
KAKU: Elon Musk shot that
Falcon Heavy rocket

05:01.718 --> 05:04.052
from Cape Canaveral.

05:04.053 --> 05:07.806
Millions watched it online. Why?

05:07.807 --> 05:11.059
Because that was a Moon rocket.

05:11.060 --> 05:14.062
For the first time in 50 years,

05:14.063 --> 05:17.441
a Moon rocket, capable of
putting astronauts on the Moon,

05:17.442 --> 05:20.694
took off from Cape Canaveral.

05:20.695 --> 05:24.406
And now, Jeff Bezos,
the richest man on the planet,

05:24.407 --> 05:29.119
has funded his own private
space port in Texas,

05:29.120 --> 05:31.788
with a fleet of rockets, one
of which we think is designed

05:31.789 --> 05:33.749
to go to the Moon.

05:33.750 --> 05:38.378
NARRATOR: Many experts have
suggested that space exploration

05:38.379 --> 05:41.339
slowed down after the initial
Apollo Moon missions

05:41.340 --> 05:44.259
because of the staggering costs.

05:44.260 --> 05:48.930
So, what is driving humankind
to once again undertake

05:48.931 --> 05:52.434
such an expensive endeavor?

05:52.435 --> 05:55.187
It is a law of nature

05:55.188 --> 05:59.900
that organisms have to either
leave, adapt or perish.

05:59.901 --> 06:05.113
99.9% of all living forms
on the Earth

06:05.114 --> 06:07.616
have gone extinct.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.744
Extinction is the norm.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.955
If you don't believe me, simply
drill right under your feet

06:13.956 --> 06:16.083
until you hit the bones.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.418
PETER DIAMANDIS: Backing up
the biosphere, so to speak,

06:18.419 --> 06:21.088
backing up humanity into a
multitude of different locations

06:21.089 --> 06:23.131
makes a lot of sense.

06:23.132 --> 06:26.176
One of the quotes I love
comes from Tsiolkovsky,

06:26.177 --> 06:27.761
who's one of the
Russian founders

06:27.762 --> 06:29.221
of the whole space movement,
and he goes,

06:29.222 --> 06:32.390
"Humanity was born
in the cradle of Earth,

06:32.391 --> 06:36.144
and we should not always remain
in the cradle."

06:36.145 --> 06:38.647
I think that it's
an inevitability.

06:38.648 --> 06:42.025
As humans, we love to explore.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.903
We started in the savannahs
of Africa

06:44.904 --> 06:47.572
and moved out throughout
the entire planet,

06:47.573 --> 06:50.158
and that made us
a robust species.

06:50.159 --> 06:53.036
And so that will continue
as we move off the planet.

06:53.037 --> 06:56.206
(man calls contingent to prayer)

06:56.207 --> 06:58.792
STEPHEN PETRANEK:
It would appear

06:58.793 --> 07:03.171
that there is a genetic
survival mechanism we have

07:03.172 --> 07:07.884
which says that we must explore,
and we must move on

07:07.885 --> 07:09.886
beyond the next horizon.

07:09.887 --> 07:13.266
I think that's built into us.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.602
NARRATOR: For humans to thrive
on alien worlds,

07:17.603 --> 07:21.648
they must first learn to
overcome profound technological,

07:21.649 --> 07:26.611
physiological and even
psychological challenges.

07:26.612 --> 07:30.699
But they must also face
something even more daunting:

07:30.700 --> 07:34.036
what if they encounter
other intelligent beings?

07:36.706 --> 07:39.249
The idea of intelligent life,
of sentient life

07:39.250 --> 07:42.878
being confined to the Earth is
just a human-centered,

07:42.879 --> 07:45.840
anthropocentric idea that
we've got to get rid of.

07:48.634 --> 07:51.720
In our Milky Way alone,
there is reckoned to be

07:51.721 --> 07:57.184
140 billion planetary systems

07:57.185 --> 07:59.436
that are not too dissimilar
to the Earth

07:59.437 --> 08:01.397
and the solar system.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.401
KAKU: The Kepler satellite has
allowed us to create a census

08:06.402 --> 08:08.778
of the Milky Way galaxy.

08:08.779 --> 08:12.073
We now know that, on average,
every single star has

08:12.074 --> 08:14.743
a planet going around it.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.621
And of them, we know that
a fraction of them--

08:17.622 --> 08:19.206
maybe one out of 20 or so--

08:19.207 --> 08:23.043
have Earth-like planets
going around them.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.670
In other words, the Earth could
have a doppelganger.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.256
The Earth could have a twin
in outer space.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.883
And how many of them?

08:29.884 --> 08:33.470
Billions. Billions
of Earth-like planets.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.972
And so, for us to assume that
we are the only game in town,

08:36.974 --> 08:39.934
I think, is ridiculous.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.395
NARRATOR: As far as ancient
astronaut theorists

08:42.395 --> 08:45.857
are concerned, evidence that
there is other intelligent life

08:45.858 --> 08:48.318
in the universe
has already been found

08:48.319 --> 08:50.779
on every corner of the globe.

08:50.780 --> 08:55.283
They believe Earth has been
visited by intelligent beings

08:55.284 --> 08:58.870
for thousands of years,
and that it most likely began

08:58.871 --> 09:02.500
during the time of the ancient
Sumerian kings.

09:07.046 --> 09:12.133
Khorsabad, Iraq.
March 23, 1843.

09:12.134 --> 09:15.845
While excavating for
archaeological treasures,

09:15.846 --> 09:20.225
a group of men, led by French
scientist Paul-Emile Botta,

09:20.226 --> 09:23.853
came upon the remains
of a huge Assyrian palace,

09:23.854 --> 09:29.609
and within it, an abundance of
Sumerian cuneiform inscriptions.

09:29.610 --> 09:33.113
When translated,
the inscriptions told

09:33.114 --> 09:34.990
of what archaeologists
believe to be

09:34.991 --> 09:37.242
the world's oldest civilization,

09:37.243 --> 09:41.997
and a group of powerful beings
called the Anunnaki.

09:41.998 --> 09:46.501
ANDREW COLLINS: "Anunnaki" was
a term of the gods

09:46.502 --> 09:49.921
used by the ancient Sumerians.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.132
But the original form of it,
it simply meant,

09:52.133 --> 09:53.967
"the sky people."

09:53.968 --> 09:57.345
It meant those that were
connected with the stars.

09:57.346 --> 10:01.349
The Anunnaki were seen to be

10:01.350 --> 10:05.478
the givers of civilization
to mortal kind.

10:05.479 --> 10:08.732
And they are described as having
these shining eyes,

10:08.733 --> 10:14.030
and having a radiance and an
otherworldly feeling about them.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.532
NARRATOR:
Based on 30 years of studying

10:17.533 --> 10:20.160
the Sumerian cuneiform tablets,

10:20.161 --> 10:24.497
in 1976, author and researcher
Zecharia Sitchin

10:24.498 --> 10:27.709
published a book called
The 12th Planet,

10:27.710 --> 10:31.463
in which he proposed that the
Sumerian gods were, in fact,

10:31.464 --> 10:34.299
refugees from another world.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.927
According to Sitchin's
interpretation of the tablets,

10:37.928 --> 10:42.975
these alien visitors, the
Anunnaki, created humankind.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.437
JASON MARTELL: It appears to be
that gods came down

10:47.438 --> 10:50.023
and literally started
a colonization project

10:50.024 --> 10:52.859
here on Earth,
creating us in their image

10:52.860 --> 10:54.944
and after their likeness.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.739
It also might stand to reason,
then, that they've infused us

10:57.740 --> 11:00.867
with a desire to then spread
this colonization project

11:00.868 --> 11:02.452
beyond Earth.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.163
GEORGE NOORY:
I think if you look

11:05.164 --> 11:07.999
at what we've been doing
in our space program,

11:08.000 --> 11:12.212
it's a blueprint
for what may have happened here

11:12.213 --> 11:14.172
a long time ago
with extraterrestrials.

11:14.173 --> 11:17.467
But I think
we're on the same path.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.803
HOWE:
We're beginning to understand

11:19.804 --> 11:24.057
that the Anunnaki gods
that were actually ETs

11:24.058 --> 11:27.185
could be still out
throughout the universe,

11:27.186 --> 11:29.479
that we could now,

11:29.480 --> 11:32.691
as we are starting
to head out into space,

11:32.692 --> 11:36.986
be encountering
the prime intelligence

11:36.987 --> 11:41.241
that originally had
civilizations on Earth

11:41.242 --> 11:44.035
and were working
throughout this solar system.

11:44.036 --> 11:47.080
NARRATOR: Are today's astronauts
simply repeating

11:47.081 --> 11:48.957
an ancient pattern,

11:48.958 --> 11:50.750
that of exploring the universe

11:50.751 --> 11:53.711
with an eye
toward future colonization?

11:53.712 --> 11:55.422
But, if so,

11:55.423 --> 11:58.842
what will become of the planet
they leave behind?

11:58.843 --> 12:02.178
Perhaps further clues
can be found by taking

12:02.179 --> 12:05.641
a closer look
at our most likely destinations.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.150
RICHARDS:
So, I suppose the biggest thing

12:15.151 --> 12:18.361
June 7, 2017.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.530
At Johnson Space Center,

12:20.531 --> 12:22.740
Vice President Mike Pence

12:22.741 --> 12:27.036
announces NASA's
2017 astronaut class.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.539
As American astronauts,
you may yet return

12:29.540 --> 12:31.124
our nation to the Moon.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.834
You may be the first
to travel to Mars.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.378
You may have experiences that...

12:35.379 --> 12:36.880
we can only imagine,

12:36.881 --> 12:39.632
those of us
who walk on terra firma.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.885
NARRATOR: These 12 men
and women were chosen

12:41.886 --> 12:45.805
from a record 18,300 applicants,

12:45.806 --> 12:48.558
more than doubling
the previous record of 8,000

12:48.559 --> 12:52.479
set four decades earlier
in 1978.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.273
Today,

12:55.274 --> 12:57.901
humankind's desire
to travel to space

12:57.902 --> 13:00.153
has never been greater,

13:00.154 --> 13:01.988
and establishing colonies
off Earth

13:01.989 --> 13:05.575
is not only a possibility
but a priority.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.410
The only question is,

13:07.411 --> 13:10.872
where will we go first?

13:10.873 --> 13:13.541
In the near term,
there are three basic locations:

13:13.542 --> 13:16.419
there is going to the Moon,

13:16.420 --> 13:18.129
there is going to Mars,

13:18.130 --> 13:20.924
and then there is free space.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.550
This is going to the asteroids,

13:22.551 --> 13:27.055
and using the asteroidal
materials to build colonies.

13:27.056 --> 13:30.141
I think you can look
at all three of those as options

13:30.142 --> 13:32.477
in the near term.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.729
I firmly believe that, um,

13:34.730 --> 13:38.691
a single-planet species
is not long to survive

13:38.692 --> 13:40.860
and that we really have
to be able

13:40.861 --> 13:42.404
to move out
into the solar system.

13:44.198 --> 13:47.325
Early on in the evolution
of the solar system,

13:47.326 --> 13:50.453
we believe Venus,
Earth, and Mars

13:50.454 --> 13:52.288
had a significant amount
of water.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.999
And they all evolved
differently.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.044
Venus went through
a runaway greenhouse effect.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.587
The water evaporated,

13:59.588 --> 14:01.965
and now the temperature
is so high

14:01.966 --> 14:03.633
and the pressure is so high,

14:03.634 --> 14:06.177
it's a place
we just can't inhabit.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.887
And when you think about that,

14:07.888 --> 14:10.723
what is the next place
for humankind to go?

14:10.724 --> 14:12.225
It's Mars.

14:12.226 --> 14:15.019
It's smaller than the Earth,

14:15.020 --> 14:18.356
but it's got a lot
of the basic characteristics

14:18.357 --> 14:22.068
and it's a great place
to start and work from.

14:22.069 --> 14:25.196
I think the most common
misconception about Mars

14:25.197 --> 14:28.449
is that it's going to be easier
than it actually is.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.827
Right now,
the International Space Station

14:30.828 --> 14:33.538
is orbiting 250 miles above us.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.124
The Moon is 250,000 miles away,

14:36.125 --> 14:37.584
a factor of a thousand.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.211
The trip to Mars
will take you on a trip

14:40.212 --> 14:44.090
that's 250 million miles away.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.467
This is not
a simple rocket trip.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.220
Wernher von Braun built
the Saturn V rocket

14:49.221 --> 14:52.140
to get astronauts to the Moon.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.852
We took three days to go there
in the Saturn V.

14:55.853 --> 14:59.522
Going to Mars
is at least 240 days,

14:59.523 --> 15:01.608
given current technology.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.444
And that's not an easy trip.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.904
NARRATOR: While a manned mission
to the Red Planet

15:06.905 --> 15:09.157
will be a long
and perilous journey,

15:09.158 --> 15:12.535
experts say
Mars has many advantages

15:12.536 --> 15:14.621
for human colonization.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.874
Temperature fluctuations
are less extreme

15:17.875 --> 15:20.084
than those of the Moon,
for example,

15:20.085 --> 15:23.379
and its gravity
is more Earth-like.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.131
People don't seem
to be terraforming the Moon.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.549
Mars is a little easier.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.384
Mars already has an atmosphere.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.844
There's a lot of real estate.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.555
I mean, you could do this.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.766
NARRATOR:
For thousands of years,

15:34.767 --> 15:38.645
Mars has practically been
a human obsession.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.314
Even before
it was known to be a planet,

15:41.315 --> 15:43.900
it was distinguished
from the other nearby stars

15:43.901 --> 15:46.194
by its deep amber color.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.571
HENRY:
Mars was referred to

15:48.572 --> 15:50.198
as Nergal by the Babylonians,

15:50.199 --> 15:52.784
the great hero,
also a god of war.

15:52.785 --> 15:57.955
In Greece, they referred to Mars
as Ares, the god of war.

15:57.956 --> 16:01.834
The god Mars, the god of war,
the god of aggression

16:01.835 --> 16:06.255
comes from this particularly
visible heavenly body.

16:06.256 --> 16:09.634
And I wonder
if the desire, the quest,

16:09.635 --> 16:12.136
the yearning to explore Mars

16:12.137 --> 16:14.639
has an aggressive
or competitive element to it,

16:14.640 --> 16:19.727
if Mars himself is not somehow
involved in the project.

16:19.728 --> 16:23.147
The ancient Egyptians had a very
particular interest in Mars.

16:23.148 --> 16:27.318
Cairo was named after Mars:
al Qahirah.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.363
It means the vanquisher,
or the conqueror.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.240
Even the Sphinx itself
was believed

16:32.241 --> 16:34.492
to have originally
been painted red,

16:34.493 --> 16:37.787
perhaps an homage to Mars.

16:37.788 --> 16:42.166
NARRATOR: Over the centuries,
humans have conceived numerous--

16:42.167 --> 16:45.378
and often humorous--
notions of what Mars

16:45.379 --> 16:46.796
and its possible
Martian inhabitants

16:46.797 --> 16:49.757
might look like up close.

16:49.758 --> 16:52.552
It has been the subject
of countless books,

16:52.553 --> 16:56.556
motion pictures
and even video games.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.516
But what if some
of the creative depictions

16:58.517 --> 17:00.560
of our interplanetary neighbor

17:00.561 --> 17:02.937
don't come
from human imagination,

17:02.938 --> 17:05.397
but from human memory?

17:05.398 --> 17:07.775
Carl Jung theorized

17:07.776 --> 17:11.028
that mankind had
a collective consciousness,

17:11.029 --> 17:13.990
and this is
a kind of genetic memory,

17:13.991 --> 17:16.409
or inherited memory.

17:16.410 --> 17:20.829
For instance,
if our ancestors perceived

17:20.830 --> 17:24.250
that lightening was dangerous,
we might inherit, then,

17:24.251 --> 17:26.586
a fear of lightening.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.380
And so it's possible
in the same way

17:29.381 --> 17:33.843
that our ancient
associations with Mars

17:33.844 --> 17:39.140
are actually within our genes
and embedded in our neurons

17:39.141 --> 17:43.019
as part of our DNA.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.271
If our ancestors
experienced something,

17:45.272 --> 17:47.482
it goes into our genome.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.735
It goes into our DNA.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.821
What if humanity
originated on Mars

17:53.822 --> 17:57.826
and we are still answering
to that call unknowingly?

17:59.328 --> 18:02.455
NARRATOR: Could there be
a profound connection

18:02.456 --> 18:04.373
that links humans to Mars

18:04.374 --> 18:07.627
deeply embedded
in our subconsciousness?

18:07.628 --> 18:10.838
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

18:10.839 --> 18:14.550
and suggest the answer
is slowly being revealed

18:14.551 --> 18:19.014
as we get closer to colonizing
the so-called Red Planet.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.770
Amersfoort, the Netherlands.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.105
2012.

18:28.106 --> 18:31.901
A private Dutch organization
known as Mars One

18:31.902 --> 18:34.111
announces a global mission

18:34.112 --> 18:37.824
to establish a permanent
human settlement on Mars.

18:37.825 --> 18:41.035
The following year, they
begin accepting applications

18:41.036 --> 18:43.704
from would-be colonists
for a manned expedition

18:43.705 --> 18:46.457
scheduled for 2023.

18:46.458 --> 18:50.711
But while the opportunity to be
among the first humans on Mars

18:50.712 --> 18:52.713
is an exciting one,

18:52.714 --> 18:55.675
one aspect of the mission
seems certain to turn away

18:55.676 --> 18:58.177
many would-be applicants.

18:58.178 --> 19:01.764
It will be a one-way trip.

19:01.765 --> 19:04.935
Nevertheless,
thousands of people apply.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.312
By the time I heard
about Mars One,

19:08.313 --> 19:09.814
I had been telling
all my friends,

19:09.815 --> 19:11.440
"I don't care
what it's gonna take,

19:11.441 --> 19:14.068
I'm gonna make it to space
in my lifetime."

19:14.069 --> 19:17.029
And it felt like there was
a calling, a destiny there.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.949
I get asked
if it's worth the sacrifice

19:19.950 --> 19:22.368
of leaving everything
I've known on Earth--

19:22.369 --> 19:24.996
family, friends, sunshine...
(laughs)

19:24.997 --> 19:29.000
rain, the beach--
and I think...

19:29.001 --> 19:31.419
to live
the first half of my life

19:31.420 --> 19:33.880
as an earthling, and
the second half as a Martian,

19:33.881 --> 19:38.259
what an amazing way
to kind of give your life to...

19:38.260 --> 19:40.261
the greater cause of humanity.

19:40.262 --> 19:46.309
This is a defining point
in the human time line.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.811
So, I suppose the biggest thing
that draws people to Mars One,

19:48.812 --> 19:50.646
the thing that
kind of hooks their attention,

19:50.647 --> 19:52.356
is the fact that it's
a one-way mission.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.734
This is very much about humanity

19:54.735 --> 19:58.738
setting up a permanent outpost
on another planet, and that's...

19:58.739 --> 20:02.116
I suppose, the thing that drew
me to it in the first place.

20:02.117 --> 20:05.369
PETRANEK:
Mars and Earth have to be

20:05.370 --> 20:07.747
in a very synchronous place

20:07.748 --> 20:10.584
in order to make
the shortest trip to Mars.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.544
When you get there,

20:13.545 --> 20:16.589
Earth and Mars
are gonna be very far apart...

20:16.590 --> 20:19.592
and you will not be able
to leave and come back

20:19.593 --> 20:21.719
for at least 400 days.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.764
In fact, it would
take you longer to get back

20:24.765 --> 20:27.016
if you left right away

20:27.017 --> 20:30.519
than if you waited 400 days
to come back.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.564
So once you get there,
you're stuck,

20:33.565 --> 20:36.108
and you have to stay there.

20:36.109 --> 20:39.820
And the truth is that it's so
expensive to get people to Mars

20:39.821 --> 20:41.948
and to establish
the first colonies

20:41.949 --> 20:46.953
that this is always, always
gonna be a one-way trip.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.996
I don't like the idea
that we do the same thing

20:48.997 --> 20:50.581
that we did with the Moon

20:50.582 --> 20:53.376
50 years ago,
where we go there, walk around,

20:53.377 --> 20:55.711
explore it a little bit,
and then come back,

20:55.712 --> 20:57.838
and then
sort of ask the question:

20:57.839 --> 21:01.384
Why bother going there?
We've been there before.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.220
The most common attribute
through all of the candidates

21:04.221 --> 21:07.264
is this idea that we're all
interested in serving something

21:07.265 --> 21:09.225
that's bigger than ourselves
as an individual.

21:09.226 --> 21:12.396
It's very much about doing
something for the species.

21:14.272 --> 21:16.899
PIEN: The journey
to get to Mars is very similar

21:16.900 --> 21:20.320
to the first settlers arriving
in the Americas.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.739
Mars One plans to send

21:23.740 --> 21:26.993
teams of four at a time,
and every two years afterwards,

21:26.994 --> 21:29.578
there will be
a new team to arrive

21:29.579 --> 21:31.872
and join the community.

21:31.873 --> 21:34.375
Eventually, probably,

21:34.376 --> 21:37.586
we're gonna see tens
of thousands of people arrive.

21:37.587 --> 21:40.339
I think for us right now,
if we make the leap

21:40.340 --> 21:43.217
and start to create
colonies off planet,

21:43.218 --> 21:47.263
we're looking at the next
giant leap of humankind.

21:47.264 --> 21:51.392
NARRATOR: Are current efforts to
leave Earth and travel to Mars

21:51.393 --> 21:53.769
simply based on a desire

21:53.770 --> 21:56.564
to explore and colonize
a new world?

21:56.565 --> 22:01.235
Or could it be based
on something even more profound?

22:01.236 --> 22:05.114
Is it possible
that we wish to return home

22:05.115 --> 22:08.034
to humankind's place of origin?

22:08.035 --> 22:11.162
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

22:11.163 --> 22:14.623
further clues
still need to be examined,

22:14.624 --> 22:17.251
starting with recent discoveries
made on Mars

22:17.252 --> 22:19.671
that point to evidence of life.

22:25.677 --> 22:29.597
DAVIES: The first thing to say
about the origin of life

22:29.598 --> 22:32.975
NASA's unmanned Viking 1
orbiter and lander

22:32.976 --> 22:36.020
touches down
on the surface of Mars.

22:36.021 --> 22:39.356
Three weeks later it is joined
by its companion,

22:39.357 --> 22:40.900
the Viking 2.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.194
For the first time ever,

22:43.195 --> 22:46.865
humanity has established
a presence on another planet.

22:48.909 --> 22:52.036
The Viking landers
actually landed on Mars

22:52.037 --> 22:54.663
and took a sample.
But they landed in one spot

22:54.664 --> 22:56.248
and they stayed in one spot.

22:56.249 --> 22:59.585
We've since sent
the Pathfinder Sojourner.

22:59.586 --> 23:03.756
And for the first time,
we have a system on Mars that,

23:03.757 --> 23:06.008
if we see something
shiny over there

23:06.009 --> 23:08.552
and we want to go check it out,
we'll send the rover

23:08.553 --> 23:10.930
and get a very close look
at it, take samples,

23:10.931 --> 23:14.850
get high-definition video
from it. And, uh, that

23:14.851 --> 23:17.770
is a very good start
for figuring out

23:17.771 --> 23:20.397
where people need to go when we
get ready to send them there.

23:20.398 --> 23:23.275
NARRATOR:
In 2012,

23:23.276 --> 23:27.696
the Curiosity rover
landed on Mars' Gale Crater.

23:27.697 --> 23:31.743
It was the most ambitious Mars
mission flown by NASA to date.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.246
(cheering, applause)

23:35.247 --> 23:37.790
One of its objectives
was to gather data

23:37.791 --> 23:40.459
that will help scientists
determine what is needed

23:40.460 --> 23:43.713
to make the planet more
habitable for human exploration.

23:52.264 --> 23:57.017
In June 2018, scientist
and aerospace engineer

23:57.018 --> 24:00.688
Dr. Travis Taylor traveled
to Johnson Space Center

24:00.689 --> 24:02.690
in Houston, Texas.

24:02.691 --> 24:07.153
There, he met with NASA
exploration mission scientist

24:07.154 --> 24:09.321
Dr. Elizabeth Rampe.

24:09.322 --> 24:14.535
Dr. Rampe analyzes data obtained
by the Mars Curiosity rover,

24:14.536 --> 24:17.204
which, six years
into its mission,

24:17.205 --> 24:23.085
is sending back some of its most
extraordinary findings yet.

24:23.086 --> 24:25.421
So there was very late
breaking news recently

24:25.422 --> 24:26.964
from the Curiosity rover,

24:26.965 --> 24:30.301
and some interesting
information came out

24:30.302 --> 24:33.512
of the sample analysis at Mars--
or SAM-- instrument.

24:33.513 --> 24:36.015
- Okay.
- So, SAM can measure gases

24:36.016 --> 24:37.933
in the atmosphere,
and it can also measure gases

24:37.934 --> 24:40.895
that are evolved from samples.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.771
So basically, we drill a rock,

24:42.772 --> 24:46.734
deliver that powder
to the instrument,

24:46.735 --> 24:49.737
and then that instrument
heats up the sample

24:49.738 --> 24:52.156
and measures the gases
that are coming off.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.116
Whatever outgasses,
it can tell you what this...

24:54.117 --> 24:55.743
- what that is, right? Okay.
- Exactly.

24:55.744 --> 24:59.288
So a big piece of information
from the atmosphere

24:59.289 --> 25:01.457
is that we've been
tracking methane

25:01.458 --> 25:04.460
over the last few Martian years.

25:04.461 --> 25:09.340
And what we see is that there is
a cycle to it, where it spikes

25:09.341 --> 25:12.760
late summer, early autumn,
and then dips again.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.012
- Wow. Yeah.
- Yeah, so the big question is:

25:15.013 --> 25:17.306
- Why is that happening?
- Right. (stammers)

25:17.307 --> 25:21.310
So that could possibly be due
to an organic material, right?

25:21.311 --> 25:23.103
- Or a biological source?
- Exactly.

25:23.104 --> 25:24.396
- Meaning life.
- So that's-- right. I know.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.023
- Right. Wow.
- So huge.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.234
I-It's not the only hypothesis
out there.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.236
- Sure.
- But, you know,

25:30.237 --> 25:34.114
there is the possibility that
there is extant life on Mars

25:34.115 --> 25:35.574
that is creating this methane.

25:35.575 --> 25:38.035
Wow.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.246
The fact that NASA has now
released information

25:40.247 --> 25:43.874
that they've measured
a cycle of methane

25:43.875 --> 25:46.752
that goes up in the summer
and down in the winter,

25:46.753 --> 25:48.921
it sounds very similar

25:48.922 --> 25:52.800
to how biological processes
create methane here on Earth.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.510
That could be evidence

25:54.511 --> 25:57.805
that there's life, right now,
on Mars.

25:57.806 --> 26:01.225
NARRATOR:
Life on Mars?

26:01.226 --> 26:03.143
According to NASA,

26:03.144 --> 26:07.189
such a profound notion
is a distinct possibility.

26:07.190 --> 26:10.150
But although the space agency
is still working

26:10.151 --> 26:12.319
to confirm their findings,

26:12.320 --> 26:16.657
ancient astronaut theorists
remain confident of the outcome.

26:16.658 --> 26:19.159
They have maintained for decades

26:19.160 --> 26:22.538
that not only does
the Red Planet contain life,

26:22.539 --> 26:24.331
but that it was once home

26:24.332 --> 26:28.294
to a highly advanced
extraterrestrial civilization.

26:28.295 --> 26:31.297
And for their proof,
they point to the existence

26:31.298 --> 26:36.260
of possible structures found
on its surface.

26:36.261 --> 26:41.015
There are lots of claims
of photographs

26:41.016 --> 26:45.269
showing different features
on the surface of Mars.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.063
These have come
from the orbiters

26:48.064 --> 26:50.607
that are obviously
taking pictures

26:50.608 --> 26:53.193
as they go around, all the time.

26:53.194 --> 26:55.654
And some people will find
different features,

26:55.655 --> 27:00.743
and interpret them as geometric
or rectilinear structures

27:00.744 --> 27:03.287
that suggest civilization.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.456
You see everything
you would expect to see

27:05.457 --> 27:08.584
if you went to someplace
on Planet Earth

27:08.585 --> 27:12.254
50,000 years from now, when the
human race have been wiped out.

27:12.255 --> 27:15.049
They clearly are
technological objects

27:15.050 --> 27:16.884
that have become fossilized.

27:16.885 --> 27:21.013
NARRATOR: While the notion
that an ancient civilization

27:21.014 --> 27:24.183
once existed on Mars
may sound farfetched,

27:24.184 --> 27:27.144
NASA has continued
to make discoveries

27:27.145 --> 27:30.022
that could reveal something
even more incredible:

27:30.023 --> 27:36.445
that life on Earth actually
originated on Mars.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.489
So what is this?
Tell me what this is.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.116
RAMPE: Okay, so this is
a Martian meteorite.

27:41.117 --> 27:44.411
So this is a rock
that came from Mars.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.163
TAYLOR:
How long ago?

27:46.164 --> 27:49.291
The rock itself is about
180 million years old,

27:49.292 --> 27:51.126
so that's when
it crystallized on Mars.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.295
And to give you some context,

27:53.296 --> 27:55.756
180 million years ago, dinosaurs
were roaming the Earth.

27:55.757 --> 27:59.968
Right. Well, we know that
this rock came from Mars.

27:59.969 --> 28:01.845
So if there was
organic material on Mars

28:01.846 --> 28:03.597
three and a half
billion years ago,

28:03.598 --> 28:05.516
something could have caused
that organic material

28:05.517 --> 28:07.559
to go from there to here, right?

28:07.560 --> 28:10.521
Right. And what's interesting
about, you know,

28:10.522 --> 28:12.189
"three and a half
billion years ago"

28:12.190 --> 28:16.276
is that's when life
was taking hold on Earth.

28:16.277 --> 28:18.570
- Right.
- So-- and, and Mars was

28:18.571 --> 28:22.574
once very Earth-like
with, uh, rivers and lakes.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.451
So why not Mars?

28:24.452 --> 28:26.120
We've got
all the building blocks

28:26.121 --> 28:28.163
for life on Mars,
so why couldn't it happen there?

28:28.164 --> 28:31.375
So it's very possible that
we're descendants of Martians.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.377
I, it... I'm not
gonna rule that out.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.129
(both chuckle)

28:35.130 --> 28:38.048
There have been a lot of changes
in my lifetime

28:38.049 --> 28:41.135
about speaking about life
on other planets.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.680
"Is it possible that humanity
evolved from Mars?"

28:44.681 --> 28:46.515
If I would have said that
ten years ago,

28:46.516 --> 28:48.350
people would have thought
I was crazy.

28:48.351 --> 28:51.395
And what that tells me, though,
is the conversation has changed.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.690
NARRATOR: While NASA's most
recent findings suggest

28:54.691 --> 28:57.568
that there may be life on Mars,

28:57.569 --> 28:59.987
and that life has potentially
existed there

28:59.988 --> 29:03.282
for billions of years,
is it also possible

29:03.283 --> 29:07.578
that Mars was the original
source of life here on Earth?

29:07.579 --> 29:13.000
Since 1974,
Dr. Chandra Wickramasinghe

29:13.001 --> 29:17.004
has advanced an intriguing
theory known as panspermia.

29:17.005 --> 29:20.257
He maintains
that carbon-based matter

29:20.258 --> 29:23.510
exists amidst space dust
and can be carried,

29:23.511 --> 29:25.763
via asteroids and comets.

29:30.059 --> 29:32.769
The standard position is that
life started on the Earth

29:32.770 --> 29:34.813
in the very small
primordial soup.

29:34.814 --> 29:37.065
And the Earth
is a very small place,

29:37.066 --> 29:40.694
in terms of cosmic distances
and cosmic sizes.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.738
It's a, a speck of dust.

29:42.739 --> 29:46.325
So to argue that the most
complicated system

29:46.326 --> 29:49.369
that we can ever know about,
which is life,

29:49.370 --> 29:51.246
started here on the Earth,

29:51.247 --> 29:54.082
is almost a travesty
of common sense.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.667
I think the first life
is certainly--

29:55.668 --> 29:57.920
there's no question
that it came from space.

29:57.921 --> 30:01.798
The first thing to say about
the origin of life on Earth

30:01.799 --> 30:06.512
is that we really have no idea
how, where or when it happened.

30:06.513 --> 30:09.014
But there's one scenario
that does work,

30:09.015 --> 30:12.893
in my view, very well,
and that is, uh, impact ejector.

30:12.894 --> 30:16.396
Mars takes a hit,
Mars rocks come here to Earth

30:16.397 --> 30:18.941
and Mars material is raining
down on Earth all the time.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.984
If there were any life on Mars,

30:20.985 --> 30:24.988
it would be conveyed to Earth
in this impact ejector.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.241
And so it's entirely possible,
in my view,

30:27.242 --> 30:31.161
that life started on Mars
and came to Earth only later,

30:31.162 --> 30:32.913
when conditions here
settled down.

30:32.914 --> 30:36.416
NARRATOR:
In 1953,

30:36.417 --> 30:39.127
British geneticist Francis Crick

30:39.128 --> 30:42.422
along with American biologist
James Watson

30:42.423 --> 30:46.009
discovered that the shape
of human DNA resembles that

30:46.010 --> 30:48.887
of a three-dimensional
double helix.

30:48.888 --> 30:52.558
But as Crick learned more
about our genetic code,

30:52.559 --> 30:55.227
he came to the conclusion
that it was so complex,

30:55.228 --> 30:59.565
it could not have developed
by mere evolutionary chance.

30:59.566 --> 31:03.945
He also believed
it did not originate on Earth.

31:05.989 --> 31:08.574
When we hear terms
like panspermia,

31:08.575 --> 31:11.410
this really resonates with
the ancient astronaut theory

31:11.411 --> 31:13.579
because it confirms the idea

31:13.580 --> 31:16.456
that life has arrived on Earth
whole and complete,

31:16.457 --> 31:20.168
and that the evolutionary
process for life even to begin

31:20.169 --> 31:23.005
would take
a much longer lifespan

31:23.006 --> 31:24.590
than even Earth
was able to provide.

31:24.591 --> 31:27.009
This raises the question,
is it possible

31:27.010 --> 31:29.678
that life doesn't
just randomly arrive,

31:29.679 --> 31:31.972
but is actually sent here
to Earth?

31:31.973 --> 31:35.809
NARRATOR: If, as ancient
astronaut theorists believe,

31:35.810 --> 31:39.271
life on Earth was seeded here
by extraterrestrials

31:39.272 --> 31:44.192
millions of years ago, did they
have a plan for humanity?

31:44.193 --> 31:47.529
Perhaps further clues
can be found

31:47.530 --> 31:50.532
by examining the ancient
Sumerian stories

31:50.533 --> 31:55.330
about the earthly activities
of the gods.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.294
CHILDRESS:
These pits might actually be

32:02.295 --> 32:06.632
NASA's Advanced Exploration
Systems division asserted

32:06.633 --> 32:10.552
that identifying and extracting
mineral resources in space--

32:10.553 --> 32:14.723
such as iron, tungsten and
titanium-- would be essential

32:14.724 --> 32:18.101
for future space exploration
and colonization.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.687
The Moon
and the near-Earth objects

32:20.688 --> 32:22.648
that are not too far from Earth,

32:22.649 --> 32:25.817
they're loaded with minerals
and-and raw materials.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.235
You can look at the Moon

32:27.236 --> 32:29.780
and where the, uh,
Sea of Tranquility

32:29.781 --> 32:32.491
and the other seas, they have
a different coloration,

32:32.492 --> 32:34.242
because there's titanium oxide
covering the surface.

32:34.243 --> 32:35.702
We know there's uranium there

32:35.703 --> 32:38.288
because we've detected
radon gas.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.374
So there's all sorts
of materials.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.752
DIAMANDIS: One of the companies
I'm proud of having cofounded,

32:43.753 --> 32:45.712
uh, is a company called
Planetary Resources,

32:45.713 --> 32:48.965
who's got a vision of going
to near-Earth asteroids

32:48.966 --> 32:51.760
to mine those asteroids
for fuel,

32:51.761 --> 32:54.638
and ultimately,
precious metals--

32:54.639 --> 32:57.558
platinum-group metals,
or construction metals.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.561
NARRATOR:
But as NASA makes plans

33:01.562 --> 33:03.814
to mine essential
space minerals,

33:03.815 --> 33:07.025
is it possible that other
advanced civilizations

33:07.026 --> 33:11.071
came to Earth-- centuries ago--
for the same reason?

33:11.072 --> 33:14.700
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

33:14.701 --> 33:16.993
the answer is yes,

33:16.994 --> 33:19.496
and they believe
the evidence can be found

33:19.497 --> 33:22.499
in the Sumerian stories
of the Anunnaki,

33:22.500 --> 33:25.627
written more
than 5,000 years ago.

33:25.628 --> 33:28.505
MARTELL:
When we analyze the story

33:28.506 --> 33:30.966
of the Anunnaki's creation
of humanity,

33:30.967 --> 33:33.218
some very interesting nuances
come out

33:33.219 --> 33:35.053
that might lead
into understanding

33:35.054 --> 33:36.805
what humans might face

33:36.806 --> 33:39.558
in their own eventual
colonization of another planet.

33:39.559 --> 33:42.728
NARRATOR: When famed
ancient astronaut theorist

33:42.729 --> 33:44.855
Zecharia Sitchin

33:44.856 --> 33:47.566
studied the Sumerian tablets
in the 1970s,

33:47.567 --> 33:50.235
he not only
reached the conclusion

33:50.236 --> 33:53.822
that the Anunnaki came to Earth
to escape a dying planet,

33:53.823 --> 33:56.533
but also noted that, while here,

33:56.534 --> 34:00.162
they used humans
to mine for gold.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.247
MARTELL: When we look at
the creation stories

34:02.248 --> 34:04.040
of biblical tales,

34:04.041 --> 34:07.836
we understand that God created
the Earth in seven days.

34:07.837 --> 34:10.005
It turns out that
this consolidated version

34:10.005 --> 34:12.716
of seven days
can be translated to

34:12.717 --> 34:15.302
a much earlier story
in Sumerian form,

34:15.303 --> 34:16.969
called the "Atra-Hasis,"

34:16.971 --> 34:20.056
where there is actually
seven tablets of creation,

34:20.056 --> 34:23.226
telling how the Anunnaki
came to Earth

34:23.226 --> 34:26.146
and genetically engineered us
in their image,

34:26.147 --> 34:29.649
and in their likeness, to mine
the gold for them here on Earth.

34:29.650 --> 34:33.904
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that when the ancient Sumerians

34:33.905 --> 34:37.282
wrote about giant beings
coming down from the sky

34:37.283 --> 34:40.076
and digging for gold,
they were, in fact,

34:40.077 --> 34:42.370
documenting a visitation
by extraterrestrials

34:42.371 --> 34:45.540
who were mining for resources--

34:45.541 --> 34:49.504
just as NASA is planning to do
in the not-too-distant future?

34:51.755 --> 34:56.426
June, 2018.

34:56.427 --> 35:00.096
Scientist and aerospace engineer
Dr. Travis Taylor

35:00.097 --> 35:03.099
is at Johnson Space Center's
Building 9,

35:03.100 --> 35:06.019
the astronaut training facility.

35:06.020 --> 35:09.481
He is meeting with robotics
engineer Lucien Junkin,

35:09.482 --> 35:12.108
who is eager to show him
the latest

35:12.109 --> 35:14.820
in extraterrestrial
transportation.

35:14.821 --> 35:17.739
I see this is a-a rover.
Tell me a little bit about it.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.407
Yeah, this is basically
an off-roading RV

35:19.408 --> 35:21.576
for Moon and Mars.

35:21.577 --> 35:24.204
And what-what is it that makes
this so much better than, say,

35:24.205 --> 35:25.497
the lunar rover?

35:25.498 --> 35:27.082
It can go out and explore.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.751
So the concept is
if you have a habitat,

35:29.752 --> 35:32.128
you're gonna take
two of these rovers

35:32.129 --> 35:36.174
and they'll go out for a week
to two weeks and explore,

35:36.175 --> 35:38.301
come back, refuel and then
we'll be back out exploring.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.220
Can-can we look inside
or maybe go for a ride?

35:40.221 --> 35:41.596
Absolutely. Let's go for a ride.

35:41.597 --> 35:43.598
- Oh, that'll be awesome.
- Okay.

35:43.599 --> 35:45.559
Just put your foot there,
jump on up.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.185
All right.

35:47.186 --> 35:49.896
Pilot's on, power's on.

35:49.897 --> 35:51.273
- Go to low gear.
- Low gear.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.776
Push forward on the stick.

35:57.446 --> 35:58.947
NARRATOR:
The Planetary Analog Test Site,

35:58.948 --> 36:02.701
also known as The Rock Yard,

36:02.702 --> 36:06.496
is a multi-acre simulation
of lunar and Martian terrain.

36:06.497 --> 36:09.541
It is here that
the Space Exploration Vehicle

36:09.542 --> 36:12.794
endures rigorous testing
to determine its readiness

36:12.795 --> 36:15.505
for eventual
off-Earth deployment.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.757
-Let's go through
that crater first.
-Okay.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.634
- Just go up and over?
- Yeah.

36:19.635 --> 36:22.929
TAYLOR: Can it handle
that kind of a...?

36:22.930 --> 36:24.306
-Yeah, if you put your foot
right up there...
-All right.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.891
...that'll brace you
in your seat.

36:25.892 --> 36:28.768
So, like, on a tank,

36:28.769 --> 36:31.062
-you would typically
feel it tip over.
-Yeah.

36:31.063 --> 36:34.399
JUNKIN: So, active suspension,
each one of the wheel modules,

36:34.400 --> 36:35.609
it senses it.

36:35.610 --> 36:36.943
Right. I see that.

36:36.944 --> 36:39.571
How about that?

36:39.572 --> 36:41.448
It's all right
to ride across these?

36:41.449 --> 36:42.825
Yeah, drive over--
across anything.

36:44.493 --> 36:46.912
TAYLOR:
Wow, this is amazing.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.538
When it sees a big rock
like that,

36:48.539 --> 36:50.123
it just goes right over it?

36:50.124 --> 36:53.501
JUNKIN: Yeah,
it just goes right over it.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.670
- Let me show you something.
- All right.

36:55.671 --> 36:57.547
So you're gonna pick out a rock
and we're gonna explore the rock

36:57.548 --> 36:59.966
- in this.
- Okay.

36:59.967 --> 37:02.969
-Yeah, let's look at that rock
right over there.
-Okay, that one.

37:02.970 --> 37:06.097
-So, look at this rock
right here.
-Uh-huh.

37:06.098 --> 37:08.808
We can bow down to it.
And now, another cool feature:

37:08.809 --> 37:12.145
you twist this way...

37:12.146 --> 37:15.815
TAYLOR: Oh, that crabs. Yeah,
yeah. I got you, I got you.

37:15.816 --> 37:17.901
JUNKIN: That crabs.
See how we can just rotate

37:17.902 --> 37:20.528
- all the way around?
- That-that's amazing.

37:20.529 --> 37:22.113
JUNKIN:
You're doing perfect.

37:22.114 --> 37:23.907
And then we're gonna shoot

37:23.908 --> 37:25.241
straight up that hill
right there.

37:25.242 --> 37:26.160
- All right. Straight?
- It'll take you-- yeah.

37:26.161 --> 37:27.703
TAYLOR:
All right.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.998
JUNKIN:
So it is a rock-climbing fool.

37:31.999 --> 37:34.501
-You could climb up a wall
in this thing.
-Yeah.

37:34.502 --> 37:37.212
We want the vehicle to go places
where they're like,

37:37.213 --> 37:39.756
"This is my
life support system."

37:39.757 --> 37:41.299
- Right. Yeah, right.
- "I'm not going there."

37:41.300 --> 37:43.551
- But the vehicle would go...
- Will do it,

37:43.552 --> 37:45.387
- if they had to.
- Will do it, if they have to.

37:45.388 --> 37:49.933
NARRATOR: If ancient astronaut
theorists are correct,

37:49.934 --> 37:52.727
and extraterrestrials
came to our planet

37:52.728 --> 37:55.563
thousands of years ago
in search of gold

37:55.564 --> 37:59.442
and other precious minerals,
wouldn't there be evidence?

37:59.443 --> 38:01.778
Some telltale sign
that the Earth

38:01.779 --> 38:06.324
was once the site of a vast,
global mining operation?

38:06.325 --> 38:09.661
CHILDRESS: There was a place
in Peru called Cajamarquilla,

38:09.662 --> 38:14.916
and at this spot there are
thousands of shallow pits

38:14.917 --> 38:19.546
that are going up the ridge of
a mountain, and they're in-line.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.256
They're quite uniform.

38:21.257 --> 38:25.260
They are only say, two,
three feet deep, these pits.

38:25.261 --> 38:28.513
And they are baffling.

38:28.514 --> 38:31.975
What these pits
might actually be

38:31.976 --> 38:35.228
is the result of
some kind of mining probe

38:35.229 --> 38:38.231
that was going up this mountain,

38:38.232 --> 38:42.152
digging these holes, and then
sampling for valuable minerals.

38:42.153 --> 38:46.281
NARRATOR: Today,
Cajamarquilla is mined for zinc,

38:46.282 --> 38:50.785
a mineral used in metal alloys
and electrical equipment.

38:50.786 --> 38:54.831
But if Earth may have provided a
treasure trove of raw materials

38:54.832 --> 38:56.791
for extraterrestrial
space travelers,

38:56.792 --> 39:00.670
what resources would Mars
have to offer?

39:00.671 --> 39:04.674
Recent NASA findings
suggest the Red Planet

39:04.675 --> 39:07.093
could be capable
of supporting human life,

39:07.094 --> 39:09.847
and in ways
never before imagined.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.355
One of the most fantastic things
that we've discovered

39:19.356 --> 39:21.983
scientists believe they have
recently found something

39:21.984 --> 39:26.363
incredible on Mars: water.

39:26.364 --> 39:30.033
On July 25, 2018,

39:30.034 --> 39:33.578
the European Space Agency's
Mars Express spacecraft

39:33.579 --> 39:36.998
reported the discovery
of a subglacial lake

39:36.999 --> 39:42.337
located a mile or so beneath the
planet's otherwise arid surface.

39:42.338 --> 39:47.092
If confirmed, it would be the
most significant evidence yet

39:47.093 --> 39:50.053
that Mars either did--
or perhaps still does--

39:50.054 --> 39:54.849
provide a habitat
for living organisms.

39:54.850 --> 39:58.728
We know that evidence for life
occurs almost as soon

39:58.729 --> 40:01.773
as you have a liquid water
environment on Earth.

40:01.774 --> 40:04.275
We could anticipate that,
you know,

40:04.276 --> 40:05.777
there would be scenarios
where people

40:05.778 --> 40:07.987
could have seeded the Earth
with life

40:07.988 --> 40:11.908
so that life would develop
very similarly on Mars.

40:11.909 --> 40:14.828
NARRATOR:
The existence of water on Mars

40:14.829 --> 40:19.249
would also be of huge benefit
to colonization efforts.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.627
And while scientists are still
confirming the presence

40:22.628 --> 40:25.004
of this subglacial lake,

40:25.005 --> 40:27.507
they are now certain
that in the distant past,

40:27.508 --> 40:30.260
the Red Planet was once blue,

40:30.261 --> 40:35.390
and boasting
a more robust atmosphere.

40:35.391 --> 40:38.017
One of the most fantastic things
that we've discovered

40:38.018 --> 40:42.605
with our orbiters and our rovers
on Mars is about its history.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.150
And a number of really
spectacular surprises

40:45.151 --> 40:46.860
have come out.

40:46.861 --> 40:51.114
The first one is that Mars,
at one time in its past,

40:51.115 --> 40:53.533
looked more like the Earth.

40:53.534 --> 40:56.911
It was a blue ocean world,

40:56.912 --> 41:00.206
with a significant amount
of water.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.333
We know for a fact
that billions of years ago,

41:02.334 --> 41:06.171
when we were first
getting started here on Earth,

41:06.172 --> 41:08.965
then Mars was a much more
clement place.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.509
We know that it had
a thick atmosphere

41:11.510 --> 41:14.470
to shield and blanket
the planet.

41:14.471 --> 41:16.306
And it would have had
organic molecules,

41:16.307 --> 41:18.850
the building blocks
of all life as we know it.

41:18.851 --> 41:23.021
So it stands to reason that
maybe Mars had its own genesis,

41:23.022 --> 41:24.772
its own origin of life.

41:24.773 --> 41:27.233
NARRATOR:
Was Mars a fertile planet,

41:27.234 --> 41:30.028
teaming with life, thousands--

41:30.029 --> 41:32.447
or perhaps millions--
of years ago?

41:32.448 --> 41:35.992
And if so, could the planet
be modified

41:35.993 --> 41:39.413
in such a way that it could
sustain human life?

41:41.290 --> 41:43.291
It is NASA's stated goal

41:43.292 --> 41:47.086
to send astronauts to Mars
in the 2030s.

41:47.087 --> 41:49.881
But while humanity's efforts
to colonize space

41:49.882 --> 41:52.717
are well underway,
there is still

41:52.718 --> 41:55.303
a tremendous amount of planning
and scientific groundwork

41:55.304 --> 42:00.266
to be done before we can truly
begin to populate alien planets

42:00.267 --> 42:02.311
with large numbers of humans.

42:03.896 --> 42:06.439
Right now, we're...

42:06.440 --> 42:08.524
we're basically just tourists
in the... in space.

42:08.525 --> 42:11.236
We take everything we need
with us.

42:11.237 --> 42:15.031
And in order to make
the next giant leap,

42:15.032 --> 42:17.492
you're gonna actually have
to start using the materials

42:17.493 --> 42:19.702
that you find in space
to help you explore.

42:19.703 --> 42:22.872
Okay? As soon as you make
that step to use the materials

42:22.873 --> 42:24.832
that are available to you
on the surface,

42:24.833 --> 42:26.626
now you're truly a pioneer.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.670
There's a number of resources

42:28.671 --> 42:30.672
that are already
available to us.

42:30.673 --> 42:32.840
And then, of course,
we're going to want

42:32.841 --> 42:34.425
to start planting things.

42:34.426 --> 42:36.469
We're going to have
to grow food.

42:36.470 --> 42:40.807
We're going to have to live
off the land the best we can.

42:40.808 --> 42:43.351
NARRATOR:
Live off the land?

42:43.352 --> 42:45.019
On Mars?

42:45.020 --> 42:48.273
According to NASA,
innovations in technology

42:48.274 --> 42:51.276
will be able to make
the Martian landscape

42:51.277 --> 42:55.405
more hospitable to humans
than was previously believed.

42:55.406 --> 42:59.575
But could this same adjustment
to a planet's environment

42:59.576 --> 43:01.661
be similar to what
extraterrestrials

43:01.662 --> 43:05.248
could have accomplished here
on Earth centuries ago?

43:05.249 --> 43:09.002
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

43:09.003 --> 43:12.380
and suggest that stories from
nearly every ancient culture

43:12.381 --> 43:16.426
prove this audacious notion
to be true.

43:16.427 --> 43:20.471
One of the strangest traditions
in South America

43:20.472 --> 43:23.766
is with the Kayapo people
in Brazil.

43:23.767 --> 43:28.688
And they have this legend
of the Bep-Kororoti,

43:28.689 --> 43:30.982
who came down from the sky

43:30.983 --> 43:33.526
in a lot of noise and wind,

43:33.527 --> 43:36.529
and landed his craft.

43:36.530 --> 43:39.532
He then taught the people
knowledge of civilization,

43:39.533 --> 43:41.659
of herbs and medicine,

43:41.660 --> 43:46.247
of building
and agriculture and crops.

43:46.248 --> 43:49.417
And today, the Kayapo people

43:49.418 --> 43:52.045
celebrate him every year,

43:52.046 --> 43:54.505
and a priest dresses up

43:54.506 --> 43:57.508
in this outlandish outfit

43:57.509 --> 44:00.345
that looks like a spacesuit.

44:00.346 --> 44:02.513
So you have to wonder,
where are they getting

44:02.514 --> 44:05.141
these ideas
of people in spacesuits

44:05.142 --> 44:07.852
if not from
some extraterrestrials

44:07.853 --> 44:10.980
who landed there
in the distant past?

44:10.981 --> 44:15.151
Today we are on the verge
of going to other planets

44:15.152 --> 44:18.071
and seeding them with life.

44:18.072 --> 44:21.074
And it makes complete sense

44:21.075 --> 44:23.409
that something like that
happened on our planet

44:23.410 --> 44:26.621
in the very distant past.

44:26.622 --> 44:28.998
NARRATOR:
At Johnson Space Center

44:28.999 --> 44:31.125
in Houston, Texas,

44:31.126 --> 44:33.419
NASA exploration mission
scientist

44:33.420 --> 44:36.381
Dr. Elizabeth Rampe introduces

44:36.382 --> 44:39.425
-Travis Taylor
to John Gruener...
-Nice to meet you.

44:39.426 --> 44:41.427
...a space scientist with NASA's

44:41.428 --> 44:45.181
Astromaterials Research and
Exploration Science Division.

44:45.182 --> 44:47.392
Gruener is working to determine

44:47.393 --> 44:49.894
what humans will be able
to grow and eat on Mars,

44:49.895 --> 44:54.399
so that they can live off
the planet's resources.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.776
TAYLOR:
So what is this?

44:56.777 --> 44:59.070
GRUENER: It's weathered
volcanic ash, or tephra.

44:59.071 --> 45:01.072
And it's very similar
to what's on Mars.

45:01.073 --> 45:04.283
Everybody thinks of Hawaii
as this paradise, right?

45:04.284 --> 45:05.660
- Warm beaches...
- Right, right.

45:05.661 --> 45:07.703
You get up on top
of these volcanoes,

45:07.704 --> 45:09.914
- and it's cold, it's dry.
- That's right, cold. Right.

45:09.915 --> 45:12.291
And so we've been using this
for a number of decades.

45:12.292 --> 45:14.877
It's kind of our
general-purpose Mars simulant.

45:14.878 --> 45:17.463
Uh, we've tried
growing plants in it.

45:17.464 --> 45:19.632
- Well, have you been able
to grow plants in it? -Sure.

45:19.633 --> 45:22.427
Because people grow in volcanic
soil all over the Earth.

45:22.428 --> 45:23.970
It's full of minerals,
all right?

45:23.971 --> 45:25.763
But what we're lacking
on Mars are

45:25.764 --> 45:28.224
- those biological things...
- Well, at least we think

45:28.225 --> 45:29.851
- we are, right?
- At least we think, yeah.

45:29.852 --> 45:32.437
Maybe not.
We're finding this methane.

45:32.438 --> 45:34.564
Well, will we need some
other things, like bacteria

45:34.565 --> 45:36.441
or something that
you have to mix into the soil

45:36.442 --> 45:38.067
-before seeds
will germinate and grow?
-Yeah.

45:38.068 --> 45:40.111
GRUENER: Yes,
'cause those roots in the soil

45:40.112 --> 45:42.822
don't just suck up the minerals
by themselves.

45:42.823 --> 45:45.700
And, of course, that makes
the planetary protection people

45:45.701 --> 45:49.245
go crazy, because we
want to bring bacteria

45:49.246 --> 45:50.913
and fungi and microbes to Mars,

45:50.914 --> 45:52.498
and, of course,
we're trying to understand...

45:52.499 --> 45:53.875
- If they're already there...
- ...if they're

45:53.876 --> 45:55.501
already there
or if there ever was.

45:55.502 --> 45:57.295
So I have a theory about that.

45:57.296 --> 45:59.881
And I believe that
we've already contaminated

45:59.882 --> 46:02.049
the rest of the solar system

46:02.050 --> 46:03.551
the way Mars
has contaminated Earth

46:03.552 --> 46:05.386
with its organic material.

46:05.387 --> 46:08.639
'Cause we've had
major meteor impacts on Earth,

46:08.640 --> 46:12.518
and it's likely
that an impact meteorite

46:12.519 --> 46:14.770
that's ejected from Earth
with enough escape velocity

46:14.771 --> 46:17.398
to achieve an orbit
that would bring it to Mars.

46:17.399 --> 46:21.986
And absolutely, if a comet
had impacted Mars and Earth,

46:21.987 --> 46:24.030
- we all have the same stuff,
so we're all... -Yes.

46:24.031 --> 46:25.573
I think whatever we find here,

46:25.574 --> 46:28.034
we're likely to find there,
and vice versa.

46:28.035 --> 46:29.911
Yeah. And so this stuff's
just sitting there,

46:29.912 --> 46:31.330
waiting for us to use it.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.709
NARRATOR: If many of
the minerals that exist on Earth

46:36.710 --> 46:39.420
already exist on Mars,

46:39.421 --> 46:43.382
is it possible that not only did
the planet once support life,

46:43.383 --> 46:46.636
but that it does so even today?

46:46.637 --> 46:50.223
There are scientists
who believe the answer is yes,

46:50.224 --> 46:53.768
and they are even willing
to go one step further.

46:53.769 --> 46:56.479
They suggest
we might be able to use

46:56.480 --> 46:59.440
sophisticated
terraforming technology

46:59.441 --> 47:01.484
to transform
the Mars environment

47:01.485 --> 47:05.988
so that it more closely
resembles that of Earth.

47:05.989 --> 47:07.823
DIAMANDIS:
When we go...

47:07.824 --> 47:10.618
off Earth, whether it's
to the Moon, to Mars,

47:10.619 --> 47:13.871
ultimately we have a choice.

47:13.872 --> 47:18.417
We either evolve ourselves
to meet that environment,

47:18.418 --> 47:23.381
or we turn that environment
to an Earth-like environment.

47:23.382 --> 47:28.177
GREEN: As we have evolved on the
planet, so has the biosphere.

47:28.178 --> 47:30.596
And indeed,
that's what will happen on Mars.

47:30.597 --> 47:32.932
We'll be using
the resources there

47:32.933 --> 47:35.810
and changing that environment.

47:35.811 --> 47:38.020
It's fascinating that right now

47:38.021 --> 47:41.732
there are active talks
by scientists

47:41.733 --> 47:46.445
who are proposing
the terraforming of Mars.

47:46.446 --> 47:48.781
It means that we know

47:48.782 --> 47:52.201
that Mars is a great candidate

47:52.202 --> 47:55.746
to, over time,
develop a similar atmosphere

47:55.747 --> 47:58.165
like here on Earth.

47:58.166 --> 48:00.334
Which is incredible, because...

48:00.335 --> 48:03.629
a planet that can sustain life

48:03.630 --> 48:05.881
is a rare thing

48:05.882 --> 48:08.634
in the billions and billions
of celestial bodies

48:08.635 --> 48:11.220
that we have in the universe.

48:11.221 --> 48:13.889
NARRATOR:
When the first Earth pioneers

48:13.890 --> 48:16.560
arrive on Mars,
what will they discover?

48:18.186 --> 48:20.771
A barren world devoid of life?

48:20.772 --> 48:24.442
Or will they confront
a profound reality,

48:24.443 --> 48:26.110
one in which
they encounter evidence

48:26.111 --> 48:28.863
of an advanced
alien civilization

48:28.864 --> 48:31.867
which once existed
thousands of years ago?

48:37.706 --> 48:39.206
CHILDRESS:
If we go to other planets,

48:39.207 --> 48:42.376
the enormous challenge
of colonizing space,

48:42.377 --> 48:45.171
it is widely believed
that robots equipped

48:45.172 --> 48:49.550
with artificial intelligence
will play a critical role.

48:49.551 --> 48:53.304
Even now,
AI technology has been used

48:53.305 --> 48:55.222
to find alien planets...

48:55.223 --> 48:57.141
classify galaxies...

48:57.142 --> 49:02.271
and even create spacecraft
capable of dodging space debris.

49:02.272 --> 49:06.359
Robotic probes, like
NASA's Cassini, for example,

49:06.360 --> 49:08.986
explored space
for nearly 20 years

49:08.987 --> 49:13.324
and was instrumental in the
study of Saturn and its rings.

49:13.325 --> 49:15.576
We always send robots out
ahead of the humans

49:15.577 --> 49:17.870
to find out
a lot of those unknown things,

49:17.871 --> 49:21.791
like, uh, is the radiation,
you know, hazardous to us.

49:21.792 --> 49:24.293
When we get there,
rather than astronauts

49:24.294 --> 49:27.380
going out in spacesuits
by themselves,

49:27.381 --> 49:29.423
it's gonna be astronauts
and robots

49:29.424 --> 49:32.551
going out
and exploring together.

49:32.552 --> 49:35.971
NARRATOR:
Most experts agree

49:35.972 --> 49:39.225
that before travel
into deep space can take place

49:39.226 --> 49:42.520
artificially intelligent robots
will need to be able

49:42.521 --> 49:46.148
to harvest mineral resources
to keep operating.

49:46.149 --> 49:48.818
A version of this idea
was first proposed

49:48.819 --> 49:51.112
by Hungarian scientist
and mathematician

49:51.113 --> 49:54.448
John von Neumann in the 1960s.

49:54.449 --> 49:58.411
He came up with the idea of
a self-replicating robotic probe

49:58.412 --> 50:00.955
that could be built and rebuilt

50:00.956 --> 50:03.207
from materials found
on asteroids.

50:03.208 --> 50:05.418
BRANDENBURG:
Von Neumann envisioned the idea

50:05.419 --> 50:08.629
of self-replicating automatons

50:08.630 --> 50:10.756
using asteroidal rubble

50:10.757 --> 50:12.842
as source material.

50:12.843 --> 50:16.387
Machines could be sent
to another planet,

50:16.388 --> 50:18.597
and it would start
making copies of itself,

50:18.598 --> 50:21.183
and perhaps evolve
from just the original copy

50:21.184 --> 50:23.894
to something more complex.

50:23.895 --> 50:25.813
From one probe,
you get a thousand,

50:25.814 --> 50:27.481
then a million,

50:27.482 --> 50:30.317
then a billion, and a trillion.

50:30.318 --> 50:33.779
And pretty soon you have
a sphere of trillions of probes

50:33.780 --> 50:37.868
colonizing the galaxy
at near the speed of light.

50:39.494 --> 50:41.829
BRANDENBURG:
NASA has proposed the idea

50:41.830 --> 50:44.331
of self-replicating automata

50:44.332 --> 50:46.208
to be sent out
to the asteroid belt,

50:46.209 --> 50:49.754
which is a place rich
in minerals and materials

50:49.755 --> 50:52.882
that are easy to get to
because they have low gravity.

50:52.883 --> 50:56.677
You don't land on an asteroid,
you dock with it.

50:56.678 --> 50:59.805
Is it possible that we
are looking at, in the future,

50:59.806 --> 51:02.183
such self-replicating automata

51:02.184 --> 51:04.935
building spaceships
out of asteroids,

51:04.936 --> 51:09.023
going different places,
doing exploration for us?

51:09.024 --> 51:10.775
It's quite conceivable.

51:10.776 --> 51:13.944
NARRATOR:
But if intelligent space robots

51:13.945 --> 51:17.573
are mankind's best hope
for exploring the galaxy,

51:17.574 --> 51:19.533
is it possible
that Earth was visited

51:19.534 --> 51:21.702
by extraterrestrial robots

51:21.703 --> 51:25.831
hundreds, and perhaps
even thousands, of years ago?

51:25.832 --> 51:29.711
If so, are we likely
to encounter them again?

51:31.421 --> 51:34.089
CHILDRESS:
If we go to other planets,

51:34.090 --> 51:36.884
we would first send
mechanical probes down

51:36.885 --> 51:39.553
to evaluate the climate
and the minerals

51:39.554 --> 51:40.930
and the temperature
and everything.

51:40.931 --> 51:42.765
You would think
that extraterrestrials

51:42.766 --> 51:44.601
would do the same
for our planet.

51:46.436 --> 51:48.979
GREEN: When you think about it,
it's got to be

51:48.980 --> 51:51.982
one of the most fundamental
things that they would do first.

51:51.983 --> 51:56.737
Sending out intelligent
robotic systems to probe.

51:56.738 --> 52:00.866
They're expendable, and you
can send them everywhere.

52:00.867 --> 52:02.785
And perhaps we should be looking

52:02.786 --> 52:06.747
for those systems first
as aliens.

52:06.748 --> 52:09.750
NARRATOR: According
to ancient astronaut theorists,

52:09.751 --> 52:13.003
evidence that extraterrestrials
sent robots to Earth

52:13.004 --> 52:16.632
can be found in the stories
of ancient cultures.

52:16.633 --> 52:19.510
ERICH VON DANIKEN:
In the story of the Argonauts--

52:19.511 --> 52:22.304
that's an old Greek myth--

52:22.305 --> 52:25.808
we for the first time hear
about Talos.

52:25.809 --> 52:28.978
Talos was... today we
would call it a kind of robot.

52:28.979 --> 52:33.274
Talos was always surrounding
the island of Crete.

52:33.275 --> 52:35.943
And whenever someone went
to come close

52:35.944 --> 52:38.737
to the island of Crete,
he shut it down.

52:38.738 --> 52:40.823
Except they had a certain code

52:40.824 --> 52:43.033
on which
he did not shoot anymore.

52:43.034 --> 52:46.745
So for us,
Talos was like a robot.

52:46.746 --> 52:48.622
YOUNG:
An important figure

52:48.623 --> 52:51.542
in early Greek mythology
was Cadmus,

52:51.543 --> 52:54.211
a divine character,
the first hero,

52:54.212 --> 52:58.632
fifth in the lineage
from Zeus of the Greek gods.

52:58.633 --> 53:01.969
It was Cadmus
that started agriculture,

53:01.970 --> 53:04.388
who brought civilization,
and he brought

53:04.389 --> 53:06.181
the making of bronze.

53:06.182 --> 53:09.143
He knew how to make alloys,
special metals,

53:09.144 --> 53:11.937
which, in the early days
of civilization,

53:11.938 --> 53:14.815
was the beginning of technology.

53:14.816 --> 53:16.901
He was a slayer of monsters.

53:16.902 --> 53:20.279
And he killed a water dragon,
and he took the dragon's teeth

53:20.280 --> 53:22.615
and planted them like seeds,

53:22.616 --> 53:26.327
and great, fierce warriors grew
out of the process.

53:26.328 --> 53:28.621
MARTELL: We have to wonder
if a lot of this

53:28.622 --> 53:30.497
is, again, depicting machines

53:30.498 --> 53:33.375
being powered by some type
of extraterrestrial energy.

53:33.376 --> 53:35.336
NOORY:
When you look at the planet,

53:35.337 --> 53:37.880
you try to hypothesize

53:37.881 --> 53:40.424
what came here,
in terms of extraterrestrials,

53:40.425 --> 53:42.092
and what came here first.

53:42.093 --> 53:43.969
Look at what we do to Mars.

53:43.970 --> 53:45.679
We send little rovers
all over the place,

53:45.680 --> 53:47.181
electronic things.

53:47.182 --> 53:49.850
Did they do that
to Planet Earth, too?

53:49.851 --> 53:51.644
Or did they come here directly

53:51.645 --> 53:55.230
and then come down
with occupants?

53:55.231 --> 53:57.524
I think what probably
happened was

53:57.525 --> 53:59.860
the craft came to the planet,

53:59.861 --> 54:03.155
and then they sent down robots
or androids

54:03.156 --> 54:05.991
to explore the planet.

54:05.992 --> 54:07.952
You must be Julie.

54:07.953 --> 54:09.954
- I am.
- I'm Travis.

54:09.955 --> 54:12.081
NARRATOR: During his visit
to the Johnson Space Center,

54:12.082 --> 54:15.334
aerospace engineer
Dr. Travis Taylor

54:15.335 --> 54:17.878
visited NASA's Robotics Lab,

54:17.879 --> 54:21.090
where he was shown the latest
in space-faring robots.

54:21.091 --> 54:24.093
Wow, so this is
the robotics lab, huh?

54:24.094 --> 54:25.928
Well, this is the Dexterous
Robotics Lab,

54:25.929 --> 54:27.638
- and this is Robonaut.
- Oh, wow.

54:27.639 --> 54:29.682
BADGER: A lot of our
future exploration concepts

54:29.683 --> 54:32.142
have us sending our assets,
sending our spacecraft,

54:32.143 --> 54:34.937
sending the food
and logistics first,

54:34.938 --> 54:37.022
and making sure
everything's set up,

54:37.023 --> 54:38.941
and then sending
our crew members.

54:38.942 --> 54:40.985
So it's possible that
the robots could actually

54:40.986 --> 54:43.070
build our habitats and things
before we got there.

54:43.071 --> 54:44.613
That's the--
That's the thought, yes.

54:44.614 --> 54:46.657
And what if you needed
to make repairs

54:46.658 --> 54:48.117
on the outside of the ship?

54:48.118 --> 54:49.702
Could Robonaut do
stuff like that

54:49.703 --> 54:50.744
instead of you having
to go out and do that?

54:50.745 --> 54:52.121
Absolutely.
Robots are great

54:52.122 --> 54:53.622
for the dull, dirty, dangerous,

54:53.623 --> 54:55.958
and the crew members
inside the spacecraft

54:55.959 --> 54:57.918
could basically be the robot,

54:57.919 --> 55:00.379
commanding everything about it.

55:00.380 --> 55:03.173
So, I noticed that Robonaut
looks very human.

55:03.174 --> 55:05.259
Why make it look human?
It doesn't have to have a head.

55:05.260 --> 55:06.969
You could put the sensors
anywhere, right?

55:06.970 --> 55:08.512
BADGER:
Yes. Absolutely.

55:08.513 --> 55:10.764
However, since we were trying
to make it

55:10.765 --> 55:13.183
for a human environment,
and to work with humans,

55:13.184 --> 55:17.479
we thought that, well,
form should follow function.

55:17.480 --> 55:19.940
So, it's an engineering
decision, but it's also

55:19.941 --> 55:24.486
kind of a good
human-interaction decision, too.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.655
We've had one on board
the International Space Station

55:26.656 --> 55:28.240
for many years.

55:28.241 --> 55:30.701
And we always,
always get the crew request

55:30.702 --> 55:33.078
to say, "Hey, can I tweet
this really cool photo

55:33.079 --> 55:34.997
"that I took of me and Robonaut,

55:34.998 --> 55:36.874
and we're doing
Tae Bo together"?

55:36.875 --> 55:40.586
So, it tends to promote bonding
a little bit more.

55:40.587 --> 55:42.713
TAYLOR: There's something
we could learn from that.

55:42.714 --> 55:45.841
If we ever were to, say,
go to another star system,

55:45.842 --> 55:49.011
and we found a culture
that were not bipedal...

55:49.012 --> 55:50.846
- Right.
- We might want to send

55:50.847 --> 55:54.099
our AI that's got, whatever,
if they were quadrupeds,

55:54.100 --> 55:57.061
we might want to make
a quadrupedal robot, right?

55:57.062 --> 55:59.480
Absolutely. I mean, people put
faces on everything, right?

55:59.481 --> 56:00.898
You'd want to do the same thing

56:00.899 --> 56:03.150
for an alien culture,
if you would.

56:03.151 --> 56:06.028
Yeah. And what kind of AI,
or whatever, runs its systems?

56:06.029 --> 56:07.529
We have sound, uh, on board.

56:07.530 --> 56:09.490
So, we do a lot
of vision processing,

56:09.491 --> 56:11.742
and we have used neural nets.

56:11.743 --> 56:13.410
Uh, we're working right now
to connect the Robonaut

56:13.411 --> 56:15.370
to the spacecraft.

56:15.371 --> 56:17.581
So, have a smart spacecraft
that knows what's going on

56:17.582 --> 56:20.959
within its walls
and be able to say,

56:20.960 --> 56:24.838
"Hey, Robonaut, I need you to go
and change this filter out."

56:24.839 --> 56:27.674
Well, the other thing that jumps
out at me is, of course,

56:27.675 --> 56:30.511
the negative scenario, where
they can become smart enough,

56:30.512 --> 56:31.845
and they want to take over.

56:31.846 --> 56:34.139
I'm not worried about that yet.

56:34.140 --> 56:35.891
TAYLOR: You're not worried
about that just yet. Okay.

56:35.892 --> 56:39.478
NARRATOR: Is mankind following
in the footsteps

56:39.479 --> 56:43.190
of its alien ancestors
by using humanoid robots

56:43.191 --> 56:46.902
in the exploration and
colonization of other worlds?

56:46.903 --> 56:50.823
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes.

56:50.824 --> 56:54.827
But how will mankind fulfill
its own extraterrestrial destiny

56:54.828 --> 56:59.081
if only robots are able
to function on other planets?

56:59.082 --> 57:02.584
For many, the answer is simple.

57:02.585 --> 57:06.755
Surviving on Mars will require
not only new technology,

57:06.756 --> 57:10.343
but a new breed of humans.

57:13.680 --> 57:14.805
KAKU: Transhumanism says
that perhaps we should

57:14.806 --> 57:16.932
TAYLOR:
Sure, let's go to Mars.

57:16.933 --> 57:19.184
NARRATOR: At the Johnson Space
Center in Houston, Texas,

57:19.185 --> 57:23.188
aerospace engineer Dr. Travis
Taylor meets with Paul Valle,

57:23.189 --> 57:27.109
the project manager for
the Active Response Gravity

57:27.110 --> 57:30.821
Offload System,
otherwise known as "ARGOS."

57:30.822 --> 57:33.740
Travis is eager
to experience firsthand

57:33.741 --> 57:36.869
how space colonists will be
trained in order to survive

57:36.870 --> 57:40.164
in reduced-gravity environments.

57:40.165 --> 57:42.416
And now you are on Mars.

57:42.417 --> 57:43.667
So this is what Mars is like?

57:43.668 --> 57:44.918
- Yep.
- I can jump...

57:44.919 --> 57:48.172
oh... a lot higher.

57:48.173 --> 57:51.758
So, if I were gonna try
and walk across Mars...

57:51.759 --> 57:54.136
TAYLOR: The ARGOS simulator
is amazing

57:54.137 --> 57:56.847
in giving me some insight
in realizing

57:56.848 --> 57:59.349
it's not easy to work
on a planet

57:59.350 --> 58:01.727
that isn't the planet
I came from.

58:01.728 --> 58:04.980
If I was on Mars or the Moon
or anywhere else,

58:04.981 --> 58:07.232
I would have to completely
retrain my mind and body

58:07.233 --> 58:08.525
for working there.

58:08.526 --> 58:10.861
Wow.

58:10.862 --> 58:12.696
-Whoa, getting up is
the hard part.
-(laughter)

58:12.697 --> 58:15.741
So if any civilizations
have done that,

58:15.742 --> 58:18.577
they would have had to do
the same type of training,

58:18.578 --> 58:20.871
or when they got here,
they'd be extremely clumsy.

58:20.872 --> 58:23.916
Yeah.
Ah, that's almost impossible.

58:23.917 --> 58:26.001
- Yeah, now imagine doing it--
- Uh-oh. There we go.

58:26.002 --> 58:28.712
- (laughter)
- VALLE: Now imagine doing it

58:28.713 --> 58:29.672
with a space suit,
life support...

58:29.673 --> 58:31.173
Yeah, like the Michelin... Yeah.

58:31.174 --> 58:32.841
You don't realize how much

58:32.842 --> 58:35.010
you use gravity
to do everything.

58:35.011 --> 58:37.722
-Yeah, you don't realize
until it's gone.
-Right.

58:40.475 --> 58:43.060
NARRATOR: Although recent NASA
footage of astronauts

58:43.061 --> 58:47.272
doing somersaults in midair
and eating floating M&Ms

58:47.273 --> 58:49.691
paints a whimsical picture
of what it's like to live

58:49.692 --> 58:52.277
in a low-gravity environment,

58:52.278 --> 58:56.323
the lack of gravity can,
over time, have a devastating

58:56.324 --> 58:59.077
and profound impact
on the human body.

59:01.079 --> 59:03.622
What we have to do
when we decide to go to Mars

59:03.623 --> 59:07.876
is really study all aspects
of human physiology,

59:07.877 --> 59:12.172
how we're going to operate
in a gravity

59:12.173 --> 59:13.882
that's much less than the Earth.

59:13.883 --> 59:16.593
Our body will change
because of that environment.

59:16.594 --> 59:19.096
We're doing research
in many ways right now,

59:19.097 --> 59:21.265
studying the effects
of being weightless

59:21.266 --> 59:23.767
and then coming back
to the Earth.

59:23.768 --> 59:29.064
NARRATOR:
March 2, 2016. Kazakhstan.

59:29.065 --> 59:32.567
American Astronaut Scott Kelly
returns to Earth

59:32.568 --> 59:36.905
after a record-setting
360-day mission

59:36.906 --> 59:39.992
aboard the International
Space Station.

59:39.993 --> 59:41.785
The duration of the mission

59:41.786 --> 59:44.246
was intended
to help researchers understand

59:44.247 --> 59:47.207
how prolonged periods of time
in zero gravity

59:47.208 --> 59:50.002
can affect the human body.

59:50.003 --> 59:54.589
Scott's identical twin brother,
Mark, also an astronaut,

59:54.590 --> 59:57.676
served as a control subject.

59:57.677 --> 59:59.761
Because of his twin's DNA,

59:59.762 --> 01:00:02.389
which is, in theory,
identical to his,

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:04.933
they could then determine

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:07.936
what kind of DNA changes
had happened to him.

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:11.273
And what they discovered
was that about seven percent

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:14.152
of his DNA had been altered.

01:00:16.362 --> 01:00:19.364
NARRATOR: Extensive post-mission
lab tests confirmed

01:00:19.365 --> 01:00:23.410
the astonishing changes
that had taken place.

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:27.914
Genes related to Scott Kelly's
immune system, DNA repair,

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:31.209
bone formation networks,
his bloodstream,

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:34.589
and numerous other systems
have all been altered.

01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:41.219
The startling results prompt
scientists around the world

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.472
to ask:
what are the implications

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:46.601
for humans who
leave Earth permanently?

01:00:48.102 --> 01:00:50.729
So, I did a lot of my
early medical work

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.774
and medical research on how
the human body adapts to space

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:55.567
as you go up into orbit.

01:00:55.568 --> 01:00:58.904
So, we are gonna begin
to speciate

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:00.947
and form sub-species of humans

01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:03.575
as we head off towards
the stars.

01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:05.619
Perhaps we should genetically
modify ourselves

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.663
to thrive in outer space.

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:11.792
We're gonna have to modify
ourselves to adjust

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:15.462
to different atmospheres,
cosmic rays,

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:18.673
radiation, you name it.

01:01:18.674 --> 01:01:21.468
DIAMANDIS: Do we want to use
gene editing technology

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:26.181
to evolve ourselves and modify
our DNA, modify our bodies

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:29.434
to meet the needs of space
as the human race is moving

01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:32.230
irreversibly off the planet?

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:37.567
NARRATOR:
February 2017.

01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:42.072
Maverick geneticist Dr. George
Church, of Harvard University,

01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:44.282
makes an announcement
that sounds like

01:01:44.283 --> 01:01:46.535
something out of
a Hollywood movie.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:51.915
Using a genome editing tool
called CRISPR-Cas9,

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:55.419
he and his team have combined
DNA from an Asian elephant

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.422
with genetic material from
a species that's been extinct

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:02.050
for nearly 4,000 years.

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:05.345
With the substitution
of 45 sections

01:02:05.346 --> 01:02:09.433
of the elephant's genome with
the DNA of a woolly mammoth,

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:12.978
they insist that a creature from
ancient times could soon be,

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:15.481
once again, walking the Earth.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:22.779
Once you have the technology
to completely decode DNA

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:26.825
and-and recode it, you also have
the technology, then,

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:31.037
to genetically alter
any human being,

01:02:31.038 --> 01:02:33.540
or any animal or plant.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:37.544
And so, therefore, you're able
to genetically engineer

01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:40.755
a humanoid species that will be

01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:43.508
better adapted to space travel,

01:02:43.509 --> 01:02:47.345
better adapted to life
on a different planet.

01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:50.515
Extraterrestrials coming here
in the ancient past

01:02:50.516 --> 01:02:54.060
could easily have done
exactly the same thing.

01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:57.481
NARRATOR:
Could extraterrestrials,

01:02:57.482 --> 01:02:59.941
in possession of this same
DNA-altering knowledge,

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:02.819
have used it to aid
their colonization efforts

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:06.072
here on Earth
thousands of years ago?

01:03:06.073 --> 01:03:09.659
An idea which once seemed absurd

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:13.497
now seems remarkably--
and eerily-- plausible.

01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:16.666
TAYLOR: Could you go
back in time and look at

01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:19.461
something like
the prehuman creatures,

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:22.464
and genetically modify them
and create

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.591
what has become Homo sapiens?

01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:27.427
With our technology today,
we could pick

01:03:27.428 --> 01:03:30.555
a near-sentient creature,

01:03:30.556 --> 01:03:32.933
and start doing
genetic modifications on it,

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:35.728
and create a new, sentient race.

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:39.189
NARRATOR:
In addition to genetically

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.066
modifying the human body

01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:42.651
in order to make it
better suited

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.903
for space travel
and colonization,

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:48.240
many experts propose that
there will also need to be

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:51.201
a merging of man and machine.

01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:55.038
Genetically modified space
colonists, they argue,

01:03:55.039 --> 01:03:58.500
will have to be fitted
with bio-mechatronic parts

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.503
in order to create a human
that is smarter,

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:05.507
faster, stronger
and more durable.

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:08.510
HOWE: I've been talking
with some scientists,

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:12.055
and they say the next thing
that's going to be coming

01:04:12.056 --> 01:04:16.309
is the cyborg evolution
of humanity

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:19.646
for those that are going
to go into space.

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:22.399
KAKU:
We have this Hollywood image

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.734
that the aliens are gonna land,
and they're gonna come out

01:04:24.735 --> 01:04:26.570
looking somewhat like us.

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:30.240
And they'll say, "Take us
to your leader, Earth man."

01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:32.325
But I think it could be
quite different.

01:04:32.326 --> 01:04:34.244
They could be part robotic.

01:04:34.245 --> 01:04:36.788
Realize that they could be
thousands of years

01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:38.790
more advanced than us.

01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:42.127
TAYLOR: There is a culture out
there that's more advanced

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:45.171
than us, that they've already
built these robotic bodies.

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:47.340
Why wait for them to come to us?

01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:50.594
We have to become
a huge, spacefaring culture,

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:52.887
a civilization to go out
and answer these questions

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:56.725
for ourselves instead of just
sitting on our hands

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:59.603
and waiting for them to give us
the answer someday.

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:03.398
NARRATOR: In finding ways
to modify the human body,

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:06.151
along with developing
highly advanced methods

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:08.361
for terraforming other planets,

01:05:08.362 --> 01:05:13.366
is mankind really going
"where no one has gone before"?

01:05:13.367 --> 01:05:17.245
Or are we simply fulfilling
our destiny,

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:19.789
one that stretches back
to the very beginnings

01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:22.834
of human life here on Earth?

01:05:22.835 --> 01:05:27.464
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:31.009
the more humans venture into
space, the closer they will be

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.094
to discovering
their true origins.

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.221
Not on Earth,

01:05:35.222 --> 01:05:39.101
but on an alien world,
far, far away.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:49.611
BARA:
There are a lot of indications

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:53.573
Noted ecologist Dr. Ellis Silver
publishes his book

01:05:53.574 --> 01:05:56.159
Humans are not from Earth.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.329
In it, he proposes
that humans possess

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:01.581
a multitude of physical
vulnerabilities,

01:06:01.582 --> 01:06:04.459
such as slower
childhood development,

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:08.296
a heightened susceptibility
to illness,

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:11.716
spinal problems
and difficulty giving birth.

01:06:11.717 --> 01:06:14.636
He concludes that they most
likely evolved

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:18.223
on another planet.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.767
There are a lot of indications
that mankind, the human race,

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:23.228
actually did not evolve
on the planet Earth.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.522
For one thing, you know,

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:27.732
if we go out in the sun
too long, we get sunburned.

01:06:27.733 --> 01:06:29.901
And that doesn't make a lot
of sense unless the conditions

01:06:29.902 --> 01:06:31.778
on Planet Earth have changed
very dramatically

01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:33.780
in the last few thousand years.

01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:36.116
You have to wear
sunglasses outdoors.

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:37.784
That also indicates
that our eyes

01:06:37.785 --> 01:06:40.203
are not properly adapted
to the planet.

01:06:40.204 --> 01:06:43.081
Some recent studies
in sports medicine

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:47.669
have shown us that the human
body creates two types of fat.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.797
One is isn't a good type of fat,
and the other one is.

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:53.174
And interestingly enough,
the studies show

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:55.635
that if you bring
the temperature down

01:06:55.636 --> 01:06:58.430
to about 67 degrees Fahrenheit,

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:01.057
you create the good fat
and not the bad fat.

01:07:01.058 --> 01:07:05.145
Near the equator on Mars
in the summertime,

01:07:05.146 --> 01:07:07.564
it's about
67 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:11.359
Now, that's Mars today,
with very little atmosphere.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.529
Imagine, in the past
where Mars had an atmosphere,

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:17.282
the average temperature
on the surface

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:19.994
might be around 67 degrees.

01:07:22.037 --> 01:07:24.164
BARA:
Another factor is that

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:26.708
when astronauts actually go
into space,

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:29.586
their circadian rhythms,
their body clocks,

01:07:29.587 --> 01:07:34.924
change from 24-hour days
to a 24.9-hour day,

01:07:34.925 --> 01:07:37.510
and that happens to be
the exact rotational period

01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:40.430
of a single day
on the planet Mars.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:42.807
Given the fact
that our body clocks

01:07:42.808 --> 01:07:45.351
are tuned to the planet Mars,
not to the planet Earth,

01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:49.647
that indicates to me that we
actually came here from there.

01:07:49.648 --> 01:07:54.944
Some have suggested that at some
point, Mars had an atmosphere,

01:07:54.945 --> 01:08:00.533
and due to some cataclysmic
events on Mars,

01:08:00.534 --> 01:08:05.789
the Martians had to find a new
home within our solar system.

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:07.832
And they came to Earth.

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:10.919
So what if we are the Martians?

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.839
NARRATOR: Could it be
that the human race

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.759
actually evolved on Mars?

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.138
And if so, what might have
caused our ancient ancestors

01:08:22.139 --> 01:08:27.227
to come to Earth
so many years ago?

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:29.312
At some point,
billions of years ago,

01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:34.274
Mars, it suffered a kind
of environmental catastrophe.

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:38.904
Its atmosphere started bleeding
away into outer space

01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:42.075
'cause it had no magnetic field
to help shield the planet.

01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:47.538
NARRATOR: In 1976, author
and researcher Zecharia Sitchin

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:52.001
proposed that a 12th planet once
existed in our solar system

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:55.712
just beyond Mars
that was somehow destroyed.

01:08:55.714 --> 01:08:58.633
Although his declaration
was based on his study

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:01.176
of ancient Sumerian texts,

01:09:01.178 --> 01:09:04.305
it was largely dismissed
by the academic community,

01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:07.015
who thought the idea absurd.

01:09:07.017 --> 01:09:09.685
But recent physical evidence
has come to light

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:11.645
that may prove Sitchin
more correct

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:15.484
than even he believed possible.

01:09:18.112 --> 01:09:21.656
NARRATOR:
October 7, 2008.

01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:24.908
An 80-ton asteroid enters
the Earth's atmosphere

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:30.957
and explodes 23 miles above
the Nubian Desert in Sudan.

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:34.042
That day, an estimated
600 meteorites

01:09:34.044 --> 01:09:38.881
literally showered
the landscape.

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:41.134
But when examined,
the meteorites were found

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:45.054
to contain something
incredible: diamonds.

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:48.390
They also contained
something else:

01:09:48.392 --> 01:09:51.519
evidence that they came from
what scientists now believe

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.356
to have been a lost planet
in our solar system,

01:09:55.357 --> 01:09:59.069
one which was destroyed
thousands of years ago.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:08.620
The asteroid belt in our solar
system, it's a strange thing.

01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:11.748
And some have suggested that
these are the remnants

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:15.877
of a planet that exploded
at some point.

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:18.630
And the inhabitants of that
planet either went to Mars

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:21.424
or they came to Earth.

01:10:21.425 --> 01:10:23.134
I am convinced
that the reason why

01:10:23.135 --> 01:10:26.095
there's such a huge fascination
with space travel

01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:29.183
is because that's
where we come from.

01:10:31.143 --> 01:10:33.436
NARRATOR: If there really were
an additional planet

01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:37.190
in our solar system that was
destroyed by a cosmic collision,

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:41.027
as Zecharia Sitchin suggested,
could its displacement

01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:43.571
have had a calamitous effect
on other,

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:48.076
nearby planets, perhaps Mars?

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:52.538
And how would the ancient
Sumerians have known about it?

01:10:52.539 --> 01:10:56.709
Between Mars and Jupiter today,
we have the asteroid belt,

01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:58.878
and the asteroid belt,
in my opinion,

01:10:58.879 --> 01:11:02.715
was once a planet
which exploded.

01:11:02.716 --> 01:11:05.468
Which exploded
because there was a war.

01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:09.347
There was a war in space,
a war in heaven.

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:12.308
Many mythologies speak about
this war in heaven,

01:11:12.309 --> 01:11:15.269
including
our Christian religion,

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.647
where they speak
that the archangel Lucifer

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:20.274
fighted against
the archangel Michael.

01:11:20.275 --> 01:11:23.528
Greek mythology, every mythology
around the world

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:26.531
begins with the war in space,
the war in heaven.

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:29.618
In my opinion,
Mars was inhabited.

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:35.623
NARRATOR: Could the human race
actually be populated

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:39.210
by the descendants
of refugees from Mars?

01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:41.337
And could this be the basis

01:11:41.338 --> 01:11:44.215
not only for
our longstanding fascination

01:11:44.216 --> 01:11:46.092
with the so-called Red Planet,

01:11:46.093 --> 01:11:49.179
but why we are so compelled
to return there?

01:11:54.601 --> 01:11:58.187
BARA: President Trump
announced a Space Force.

01:11:58.188 --> 01:12:01.399
The White House Office
of Science and Technology

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.110
releases an 18-page report.

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:06.612
It outlines what NASA and FEMA,

01:12:06.613 --> 01:12:08.781
the Federal Emergency
Management Agency,

01:12:08.782 --> 01:12:12.535
must do in the next decade
to prevent deadly asteroids

01:12:12.536 --> 01:12:14.662
from crashing into Earth.

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:19.125
The document covers everything
from earlier detection

01:12:19.126 --> 01:12:21.586
and possible deflection
to ways of dealing

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:26.466
with the fallout
from a catastrophic impact.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:29.761
We have a lot
of these small bodies,

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:33.222
these things that are coming out
of the asteroid belt,

01:12:33.223 --> 01:12:37.643
these rocky meteors
that then impact the Earth.

01:12:37.644 --> 01:12:40.396
So over the last 15 years,

01:12:40.397 --> 01:12:44.233
we've studied how many are
there, how many cross our orbit.

01:12:44.234 --> 01:12:47.153
And we find that there are
some really big ones.

01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:49.113
They are gonna hit the Earth.

01:12:49.114 --> 01:12:52.785
It's not a matter of if,
it's only a matter of when.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.248
We get a single hit
from an asteroid

01:12:59.249 --> 01:13:01.250
that's as big as the one
that took out the dinosaurs--

01:13:01.251 --> 01:13:04.253
and, that by the way,
is a 100% probability

01:13:04.254 --> 01:13:07.256
that that is gonna happen,
sooner or later.

01:13:07.257 --> 01:13:10.718
When that happens, all human
life on Earth comes to a halt

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:13.388
and we go extinct.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.307
All of our proverbial eggs
are in this one basket.

01:13:16.308 --> 01:13:20.561
If anything happens to us, if
there is an asteroid incident,

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:25.775
if there is,
a human disaster created,

01:13:25.776 --> 01:13:31.155
every element of our culture
can get wiped out instantly.

01:13:31.156 --> 01:13:33.282
NARRATOR:
In recent years,

01:13:33.283 --> 01:13:35.785
more and more experts
have come forward

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:38.079
to stress the importance
of establishing

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.623
human settlements off Earth

01:13:40.624 --> 01:13:44.877
in order to insure
the continuation of the species.

01:13:44.878 --> 01:13:49.048
But is humankind still
many years away

01:13:49.049 --> 01:13:53.094
from having the capability
to realize this ambitious goal?

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:57.807
Or could efforts to colonize
Mars be much further along

01:13:57.808 --> 01:14:00.936
than the government
is willing to reveal?

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:07.316
Boulder, Colorado,
August 8, 2018.

01:14:07.317 --> 01:14:11.195
Tech titan and SpaceX founder
Elon Musk

01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:14.365
convenes a secret meeting
of high-level scientists,

01:14:14.366 --> 01:14:18.369
engineers and
space colonization experts.

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:21.289
The 60 attendees are warned

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.624
not to publicize anything
about the meeting

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:26.919
or even acknowledge
their participation.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.463
But news of the meeting leaks,

01:14:29.464 --> 01:14:31.632
sparking widespread speculation.

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:35.136
Why such secrecy
from its organizer,

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:38.389
a man who rarely shies away
from the spotlight?

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:41.309
Some have suggested
there could be a connection

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:44.896
to an event that happened
seven weeks earlier--

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:48.691
President Donald Trump's call
for the establishment

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:51.068
of a new branch
of the U.S. military,

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:55.031
the Space Force.

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:58.075
So, recently, President Trump
announced a Space Force.

01:14:58.076 --> 01:15:01.245
Basically, what he's saying is,
we are going to develop

01:15:01.246 --> 01:15:04.373
an outer space initiative,
a deep space program...

01:15:04.374 --> 01:15:07.126
that's gonna be started
from the military,

01:15:07.127 --> 01:15:08.794
controlled by the military

01:15:08.795 --> 01:15:10.338
and apparently will have
militaristic aims.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.173
Now, some people
may find this alarming,

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:14.550
but others
may look at it and say,

01:15:14.551 --> 01:15:16.260
what's really happening here

01:15:16.261 --> 01:15:18.387
is a very, very crucial moment
in human history

01:15:18.388 --> 01:15:20.264
and in the history
of the United States,

01:15:20.265 --> 01:15:24.602
where we are stepping into space
in a real, real serious way.

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:27.396
NICK POPE: In relation
to the space program,

01:15:27.397 --> 01:15:29.690
the private sector players--

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:32.693
the billionaires,
the Elon Musks--

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:36.197
they're increasingly the people
making the decisions on this.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:40.368
It's almost as if government
is losing control of this.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:45.164
Or it might be now wholly
in the private sector.

01:15:45.165 --> 01:15:47.166
Maybe being deliberately moved.

01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:49.168
It is, I think,
sometimes more difficult

01:15:49.169 --> 01:15:53.005
for people to find out what's
going on in the private sector

01:15:53.006 --> 01:15:55.383
than actually what's
going on in government.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:58.261
I had an interview once
with an astronaut

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:02.390
about the fact that
if we don't get ourselves,

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:05.518
get some contingency
of humans off--

01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:08.354
some on the Moon,

01:16:08.355 --> 01:16:11.440
some on Mars and going beyond--

01:16:11.441 --> 01:16:13.442
that eventually,

01:16:13.443 --> 01:16:16.571
homo sapiens sapiens,
as a species,

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:19.198
if confined only to Earth,

01:16:19.199 --> 01:16:22.326
might face
an existential crisis.

01:16:22.327 --> 01:16:26.163
We deserve to know the truth,

01:16:26.164 --> 01:16:28.457
that there is
alien intelligence,

01:16:28.458 --> 01:16:31.043
and our government
knows about it in great detail.

01:16:31.044 --> 01:16:36.173
And now we're finally
at the intersection, in time,

01:16:36.174 --> 01:16:39.302
where that has to break out

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:42.596
if we're going to grow
and go beyond Earth

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:47.518
and start moving out
into our own solar system.

01:16:47.519 --> 01:16:49.395
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:51.647
that there are people within
the United States government

01:16:51.648 --> 01:16:56.319
who already know that the
first astronauts to land on Mars

01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.698
will encounter intelligent
extraterrestrial life?

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:04.160
And are they secretly working
with billionaires

01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:06.996
in order to help
carry out preparations

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:11.042
for this inevitability
outside of the public eye?

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:15.087
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

01:17:15.088 --> 01:17:18.299
whatever the government does
or does not know,

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.510
as we begin
to migrate off Earth,

01:17:21.511 --> 01:17:24.764
all of humanity
will soon learn the truth:

01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:28.101
that we are not alone
in the universe.

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:35.483
I think what we're very near
is an event, a discovery.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:38.569
Could be on the Moon,
could be Mars,

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:42.823
could be maybe Proxima Centauri
or any of our local stars,

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.700
where we're gonna understand

01:17:44.701 --> 01:17:46.994
that everything
that ancient astronaut theorists

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:50.748
have been talking about is true.

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:54.168
We human beings,
we fancy ourselves as, you know,

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:57.129
being pioneers
and wanting to be the first.

01:17:57.130 --> 01:18:00.341
And that's wonderful.
We are pioneers.

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:02.343
We are the first
on many, many things.

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:04.345
But...

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:08.391
what if we arrive on Mars,

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:11.143
we actually land there,

01:18:11.144 --> 01:18:14.563
and there are
artificial structures?

01:18:14.564 --> 01:18:17.983
It's just the closing
of a gigantic circle.

01:18:17.984 --> 01:18:21.070
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that ancient stories,

01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:23.489
involving everything
from angels and gods

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.282
descending to the Earth

01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:28.911
to miracles and extraordinary
extraterrestrial events,

01:18:28.912 --> 01:18:33.082
were handed down
from generation to generation

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:38.254
in order to prepare mankind
for interplanetary exploration?

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:43.759
Ancient astronaut theorists not
only believe the answer is yes,

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.096
but they also point
to a recent scientific discovery

01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:51.350
that may indicate we are
rapidly approaching an exodus...

01:18:51.351 --> 01:18:53.395
from Planet Earth.

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:03.320
NARRATOR:
The University of Tennessee.

01:19:03.321 --> 01:19:05.906
2012.

01:19:05.907 --> 01:19:09.702
Forensic anthropologists
examining human skulls

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:13.789
dating from the mid-1800s
to the mid-1980s

01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:16.792
find that,
in the past 100 years,

01:19:16.793 --> 01:19:21.422
human skulls have become larger,
taller and narrower.

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:24.884
Although exactly why
these changes have occurred

01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:27.136
is still being debated,

01:19:27.137 --> 01:19:30.139
many scientists believe
that even more rapid changes

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.516
will take place
when future humans

01:19:32.517 --> 01:19:35.060
spend more and more
of their lives

01:19:35.061 --> 01:19:37.688
living in outer space.

01:19:37.689 --> 01:19:41.817
According to them, the human
head will continue to grow wider

01:19:41.818 --> 01:19:43.903
as brain mass increases.

01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:46.280
Decreased access to sunlight

01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:49.116
could lead to the development
of larger eyes.

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:51.619
And nostrils might elongate,

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.914
in order to facilitate breathing
in dusty environments,

01:19:54.915 --> 01:19:58.000
like that of Mars.

01:19:58.001 --> 01:20:01.670
Scientists have suggested
that if beings like us

01:20:01.671 --> 01:20:03.464
were to go into space

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:05.883
and spend long periods in space,

01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:08.844
without normal gravity and such,
that our muscles

01:20:08.845 --> 01:20:10.721
would begin to atrophy,

01:20:10.722 --> 01:20:13.933
we would have
much more longer, spindly arms.

01:20:13.934 --> 01:20:16.185
And this is how, sometimes,

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:18.896
extraterrestrials
are described as well.

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:21.649
If I say that,
somehow or other,

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:25.110
life on Earth came
from an extraterrestrial source,

01:20:25.111 --> 01:20:27.071
your first thought
is immediately:

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:28.864
ooh, little green men
or little grey aliens

01:20:28.865 --> 01:20:30.991
with big bug eyes
or whatever did that.

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:32.826
But it's an interesting parallel

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:36.038
when you hear people talk
about humans' evolution.

01:20:36.039 --> 01:20:39.208
Is it possible that that's
what humanity might become

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:43.338
for spacefaring purposes,
is more like these grey aliens?

01:20:44.756 --> 01:20:46.882
One theory that's been proposed,

01:20:46.883 --> 01:20:49.635
that these are actually
ancestors of humanity

01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:52.346
that left Planet Earth
at some point,

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.807
and over millions
and millions of years

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:57.434
have evolved
into this more spindly-limbed,

01:20:57.435 --> 01:21:00.980
more neuro-focused,
night vision-focused creature,

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:04.692
but actually are tied
to humanity's past.

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:07.278
Some have suggested
that the ancient astronauts

01:21:07.279 --> 01:21:09.905
that our ancestors encountered

01:21:09.906 --> 01:21:14.660
perhaps were us human beings
from the future

01:21:14.661 --> 01:21:17.871
going back in time to teach us.

01:21:17.872 --> 01:21:20.457
That's an interesting idea,

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:23.919
because I think that time travel
is conceivably possible.

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:27.673
However, with the ancient texts
that I'm familiar with,

01:21:27.674 --> 01:21:30.801
I have yet
to come across a passage

01:21:30.802 --> 01:21:33.304
that one of these "gods"

01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:36.265
says to our ancestors,

01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:39.310
"We're the same,
but we are from the future."

01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:42.813
NARRATOR: While ancient
astronaut theorists are divided

01:21:42.814 --> 01:21:45.149
on the question
of whether extraterrestrials,

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:47.151
like the so-called Greys,

01:21:47.152 --> 01:21:50.154
are, in fact,
biologically evolved humans

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:52.740
visiting us from the future,

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:56.327
what they all agree on is
that the day is fast approaching

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:58.537
when we will
finally know the truth

01:21:58.538 --> 01:22:01.540
about mankind's alien origins.

01:22:01.541 --> 01:22:04.043
HENRY:
In creation mythologies,

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:08.005
there's a plan that emerges,
and this plan

01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:10.674
is for people
to become more like the gods,

01:22:10.675 --> 01:22:14.345
so that we could be reunited
with them in the stars.

01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:16.013
We are on the cusp of,

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:18.849
or perhaps even
in the middle of, right now,

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:21.101
this tremendous transformation
that will connect us

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:23.146
with extraterrestrial beings.

01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:26.982
HOWE:
A Gallup poll was done

01:22:26.983 --> 01:22:29.401
to ask questions

01:22:29.402 --> 01:22:31.528
of the population
that would indicate

01:22:31.529 --> 01:22:35.157
whether or not they had
had interactions with...

01:22:35.158 --> 01:22:39.620
biological entities
that were not human.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:42.706
And that Gallup poll
came to the conclusion

01:22:42.707 --> 01:22:46.168
that three to four percent
of the current population

01:22:46.169 --> 01:22:49.046
of our planet
have had an interaction

01:22:49.047 --> 01:22:52.049
with something that's
in the nonhuman category.

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:56.095
So are the nonhumans waiting
for a specific moment

01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:59.223
in which they will say
the human experiment

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:03.143
is beginning to grow up?

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:06.647
We want to go out and explore.

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:10.067
And we think it's the beginning.

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:12.237
It's not the beginning.

01:23:14.447 --> 01:23:17.199
HENRY: I don't think it's
coincidental that at this moment

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.453
we are recording mass sightings
of extraterrestrial craft.

01:23:21.454 --> 01:23:23.038
We're understanding
the ancient world

01:23:23.039 --> 01:23:25.541
and how they interacted
with extraterrestrials.

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:27.960
Science is advancing
to understand this.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:30.170
Communications
are being put in place.

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:32.464
I think all of this
is leading to this moment

01:23:32.465 --> 01:23:34.216
where we're gonna peak,

01:23:34.217 --> 01:23:36.093
where we're gonna experience

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:38.262
this disclosure,
this convergence,

01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:42.015
this return, and it
will forever change humanity.

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:44.768
NARRATOR:
Will humankind succeed

01:23:44.769 --> 01:23:48.772
in establishing new colonies
on other planets?

01:23:48.773 --> 01:23:52.484
And if we do, will we discover

01:23:52.485 --> 01:23:55.237
that we are not
the pinnacle of creation,

01:23:55.238 --> 01:23:59.825
but just the newest members
of an intergalactic society?

01:23:59.826 --> 01:24:02.494
Perhaps as we transition
off of Earth

01:24:02.495 --> 01:24:05.789
and out into the stars,
we will find

01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:09.334
that we are not reaching
the peak of our human evolution,

01:24:09.335 --> 01:24:11.920
but only the beginning
of a destiny

01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:14.590
that's as limitless
as the universe.
