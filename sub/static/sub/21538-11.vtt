00:07.774 --> 00:08.975
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.677
- RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE IN A VERY CRAZY MARKET.

00:10.710 --> 00:11.878
IT'S NOT ABOUT SELLING UNITS.

00:11.911 --> 00:14.114
IT'S ABOUT SELLING THEM
FOR THE TOP DOLLAR.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.582
- [gasps]

00:15.615 --> 00:17.484
"5.350 IS A GO.

00:17.517 --> 00:18.485
WAY TO GO, FREDDY."

00:18.518 --> 00:19.486

YES!

00:25.558 --> 00:26.559

00:26.593 --> 00:27.660
YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR [bleep] DEAL.

00:27.694 --> 00:28.795
- OH, MY GOD.

00:28.828 --> 00:30.563
BIGGEST DEAL OF MY CAREER.
LET'S GO.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.165
YOU ARE NOT GONNA
[bleep] THIS UP FOR ME.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.833
- ARE YOU SURE?
YOU WANT THIS IN YOUR MOUTH?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.468
- I SWEAR TO GOD,
I WILL BREAK YOUR TEETH.

00:35.502 --> 00:37.037
- IT WAS
THE MOST HUMILIATING THING

00:37.070 --> 00:38.038
ANYONE'S EVER DONE TO ME.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.472
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO CRY IN FRONT OF YOU?

00:39.506 --> 00:40.473
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
- NO.

00:40.507 --> 00:41.474
YOU HURT ME.

00:41.508 --> 00:42.575
- FREDRIK HAS TOLD ME

00:42.609 --> 00:44.044
THAT YOU'RE
A LITTLE "MINI" FREDRIK.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.645
- WHAT THE [bleep]
IS THIS GUY'S PROBLEM?

00:45.679 --> 00:47.113
YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOU WANTED TO HELP ME,

00:47.147 --> 00:48.515
AND I SAID
I WANT NEW DEVELOPMENTS.

00:48.548 --> 00:49.582
- YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THAT.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.217
- MAYBE YOU MISS
HAVING CONTROL OVER ME.

00:51.251 --> 00:52.218
[bleep] YOU.

00:52.252 --> 00:53.787
- OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

00:53.820 --> 00:56.990
[upbeat music]

00:57.023 --> 00:58.825
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION...

00:58.858 --> 01:01.828
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

01:01.861 --> 01:05.265
- NEW YORK CITY, IT'S THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

01:05.298 --> 01:06.366
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.702
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.137
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:11.171 --> 01:12.272
[squeals]

01:12.305 --> 01:13.940
- I WILL BREAK YOUR TEETH.
- REACH HIGH.

01:13.973 --> 01:15.275
- CAN YOU TAKE THIS GUY
OUT OF HERE?

01:15.308 --> 01:16.843
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO HELP ME.

01:16.876 --> 01:18.778
- WHAT?
- YOU WANT TO CONTROL ME.

01:18.812 --> 01:22.515

01:22.549 --> 01:25.518
[gentle music]

[cell phone jingling]

01:43.103 --> 01:45.939
- OH, MY GOSH.

01:45.972 --> 01:49.542
[bleep] OFF.

01:49.576 --> 01:50.910
[cell phone dings]

02:14.067 --> 02:15.902
PIECE OF [bleep].

02:15.935 --> 02:16.903
[yells angrily]

02:16.936 --> 02:19.339
RUINS MY DAY.

02:33.420 --> 02:38.625
- YURI, LET'S GO OVER
TO THE ORION ON 42ND AND 9TH.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.227
THE ORION IS
A HIGH-RISE CONDOMINIUM

02:41.261 --> 02:44.931
ON THE EDGE OF TIMES SQUARE
AND HELL'S KITCHEN.

02:44.964 --> 02:49.135
YOU'RE ONE BLOCK AWAY
FROM THE EPICENTER OF MANHATTAN.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.004
[knocking on door]

02:51.104 --> 02:52.105
HEY, MAN.

02:52.138 --> 02:53.306
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
- WHAT'S UP?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.607
YOU LOOK GOOD.
- YEAH, THANK YOU.

02:54.641 --> 02:55.608
- NICE DANCE PANTS.

02:55.642 --> 02:56.843
- [laughs]

02:56.876 --> 02:58.445
- I'VE KNOWN ANDREW
FOR A FEW YEARS.

02:58.478 --> 03:01.681
HE IS A WORLD-FAMOUS
BALLROOM DANCER,

03:01.715 --> 03:03.350
BUT LITTLE DOES HE KNOW

03:03.383 --> 03:06.486
THAT I'M NOT JUST HERE
TO LIST HIS APARTMENT.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.054
AWESOME.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.094
SO THESE ARE THE VIEWS
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.162
- ABSOLUTELY.
- INCREDIBLE.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.764
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE THIS.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.866
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST STAY HERE.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.267
both: NAH.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.469
- [laughs]
- ALL RIGHT.

03:27.073 --> 03:29.075
I JUST HAVE, LIKE,
THIS IMAGE OF YOU, AND, LIKE--

03:29.109 --> 03:31.644
DANCING HERE AND, LIKE,
FLIPPING PANCAKES AND STUFF.

03:31.678 --> 03:33.079
- I DON'T THINK
I DANCE LIKE THAT.

03:33.079 --> 03:35.115
MY DANCING WOULD BE SOMETHING
MUCH MORE...

03:35.148 --> 03:36.516
THAT KIND OF WAY.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.284
- LET'S STICK TO WHAT
I'M GOOD AT FOR A SECOND.

03:38.318 --> 03:39.319
SO KITCHEN LOOKS GOOD.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.126
ALL RIGHT,
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT PRICE?

03:46.159 --> 03:47.127
- OKAY, LET'S DO THAT.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.562
- YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.231
SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
IN TERMS OF PRICE?

03:51.264 --> 03:54.100
- WELL, I KIND OF LOOKED
AT THE COMPS IN THE BUILDING.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.101
- MM-HMM.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.170
- I THINK 1.9 MILLION.

03:57.203 --> 03:59.639
- UH, WHAT COMPS
ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

03:59.673 --> 04:01.775
BECAUSE THE SAME APARTMENT
A FEW FLOORS DOWN

04:01.808 --> 04:03.610
SOLD FOR 1.5, RIGHT,

04:03.643 --> 04:06.079
WHICH IS, LIKE, 1,400 A FOOT.

04:06.112 --> 04:07.414
- IF YOU LOOK
AT THE STOCK MARKET,

04:07.447 --> 04:09.115
WHICH ACTUALLY DRIVES

04:09.149 --> 04:10.650
REAL ESTATE MARKET
IN NEW YORK CITY...

04:10.684 --> 04:11.651
- I AGREE.

04:11.685 --> 04:15.789
- IT WAS ABOUT 1,400
AND DOWN.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.490
NOW IT'S 1,500.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.459
- ARE YOU, LIKE,
DANCING WITH CNBC ON?

04:19.492 --> 04:21.428
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- YEAH, ACTUALLY, I DO.

04:21.461 --> 04:24.197
- RIGHT.

04:24.230 --> 04:26.066
SO LET'S DO THIS, OKAY?

04:26.099 --> 04:28.068
1.725 FOR THE APARTMENT.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.202
THAT'S WHERE WE LIST IT.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.671
THAT'S $225,000 MORE

04:31.705 --> 04:33.973
THAN WHAT THIS APARTMENT
SOLD FOR JUST RECENTLY

04:34.074 --> 04:34.974
A FEW FLOORS BELOW.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.976
BUT I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN

04:37.077 --> 04:40.714
TO GET YOU AS CLOSE
TO 1.9 AS POSSIBLE.

04:44.751 --> 04:46.586
- WELL, OKAY.
I'LL DO IT.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.188
- AND BECAUSE
YOU'RE THE GREATEST DANCER

04:48.221 --> 04:50.156
IN THE WORLD,

04:50.190 --> 04:52.125
I WANT YOU TO TEACH ME TO DANCE.

04:52.158 --> 04:53.426
- DANCE?

04:53.460 --> 04:55.295
- YEAH.
- [laughs]

04:55.328 --> 04:56.863
- I'M TRYING TO BE
A BETTER BOYFRIEND,

04:56.896 --> 04:59.766
AND I THINK
I'M DOING PRETTY WELL.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.868
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
SHE'S ALWAYS WANTED TO DO

05:01.901 --> 05:03.870
THAT I DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.071
- DON'T YOU WANT TO GO OUT?

05:05.105 --> 05:06.406
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

05:06.439 --> 05:07.407
- I DON'T KNOW.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.808
WE COULD GO DANCING.

05:08.842 --> 05:09.809
- NO.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.177
DANCING.

05:11.211 --> 05:14.314
MY GIRLFRIEND WANTS
TO GO DANCING.

05:14.347 --> 05:15.682
I DON'T DANCE.

05:15.715 --> 05:16.816
SERIOUSLY THOUGH.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.251
NOT LIKE--I'M NOT JOKING.
- COME ON.

05:18.284 --> 05:20.153
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES
TO BECOME A DANCER?

05:20.186 --> 05:21.287
IT'S A LOT OF WORK.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.288
- I'VE SEEN
<i>DANCING WITH THE STARS.</i>

05:22.322 --> 05:25.158
- [laughs]
- DEAL?

05:25.191 --> 05:26.726
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.128
- YES.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.497
- YOU BETTER NOT SUCK.

05:30.530 --> 05:31.731
- I WON'T.

05:31.765 --> 05:32.832
- OH, MY GOD.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.167
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT AM I SIGNING FOR.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.502
- YOU'RE GOOD, GOOD.
YOU'RE GOOD.

05:35.535 --> 05:38.138
NOW YOU CAN'T
GET OUT OF IT.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.680
- WE'RE GOING TO THE HAMPTONS.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.181
WE ARE SO EXCITED.

05:48.214 --> 05:50.417
THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
THAT I'M ABOUT TO VISIT

05:50.450 --> 05:52.619
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.488
IT'S OUTSIDE MANHATTAN
IN THE HAMPTONS.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.891
I THINK HE KNOWS
WE'RE GOING TO NATURE.

05:57.924 --> 06:01.394
BEACHES AND WOODS
AND BIG COMMISSIONS.

06:01.428 --> 06:02.796
[both laugh]

06:02.829 --> 06:04.197
I SEE THIS
AS A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

06:04.230 --> 06:05.231
TO BRING DEREK WITH.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.367
I CAN DO SOME BUSINESS,
HE CAN RELAX,

06:07.400 --> 06:09.502
AND IT'S A NICE WEEKEND
TOGETHER.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.708
THE HAMPTONS IS A SERIES
OF SMALL VILLAGES

06:14.741 --> 06:16.109
ALONG LONG ISLAND,

06:16.142 --> 06:19.446
JUST 1 1/2 TO 2 1/2 HOURS
FROM THE CENTER OF MANHATTAN.

06:19.479 --> 06:22.515
MOST WEALTHY PEOPLE IN MANHATTAN

06:22.549 --> 06:25.585
ACTUALLY OWN BIG PROPERTIES
OUT IN THE HAMPTONS,

06:25.618 --> 06:27.520
AND DURING THE WARMER MONTHS
OF THE YEAR,

06:33.226 --> 06:36.763
IT'S LIKE A PLAYGROUND

BABE, WE'RE HERE.

[gasps]

06:45.071 --> 06:46.639
[hip-hop music]

06:46.673 --> 06:48.842
- THE DEVELOPMENT IS CALLED
BARN & VINE.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.910
IT'S COMPRISED OF 37 HOMES

06:50.944 --> 06:53.213
RANGING

07:02.756 --> 07:03.890

THIS IS MY HUSBAND.

07:10.797 --> 07:11.765
THIS IS TERRY.

07:11.798 --> 07:12.766
I'M THE PRIMARY BROKER

07:16.603 --> 07:19.372
ADDED ON TERRY

07:19.406 --> 07:20.774
TO DO SHOWINGS OUT THERE

07:20.807 --> 07:23.843
WHILE I'M BUSY FINDING BUYERS
IN MANHATTAN.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.478
SHE'S GONNA BE DOING ALL
THE SHOWINGS OUT HERE FOR ME.

07:25.512 --> 07:26.680
I'M IN MANHATTAN.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.248
I CAN'T, LIKE,
DO ALL THE SHOWINGS HERE.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.349
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF INTO?

07:29.382 --> 07:32.519

ICONIC DEVELOPERS IN MANHATTAN.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.425
I LOVE HER.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.860
I'VE BEEN DOING A COUPLE OF
SMALLER BOUTIQUE HOMES DOWNTOWN,

07:40.894 --> 07:42.796
AND NOW IT'S TIME
FOR THE BIG ONE:

07:42.829 --> 07:43.797
BRIDGEHAMPTON.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.066
SO THIS IS
THE MOST FINISHED HOUSE.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.534
- RIGHT.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.602
I'M SO EXCITED.
IT IS SO GORGEOUS.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.137
- YOU WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING

07:51.171 --> 07:53.673
- YES, LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS, WALK OUT.

07:56.509 --> 07:59.746
THE HOUSE IS SO DAMN BIG.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.085
- AND I NOTICED
THE OPEN FLOOR PLAN.

08:05.118 --> 08:08.855
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT
FOR ENTERTAINING IN THE SUMMER.

08:08.888 --> 08:11.324
YOUR 16-FOOT DOORS
OPENING WIDE...

08:11.358 --> 08:13.460

GRILLING, BARBECUE,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.161
AND A SWIMMING POOL OF YOUR OWN.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.864
SO WE'RE THINKING SOMEWHERE
IN THE LINES OF 3 MILLION

08:17.897 --> 08:19.632
ALL THE WAY UP TO 4 1/2 MILLION
IN PRICE?

08:19.666 --> 08:20.767
- YES.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.169
- BARN & VINE
IS A GORGEOUS DEVELOPMENT.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.270
AND IT'S UNIQUE,

08:24.304 --> 08:25.672
BECAUSE WE'RE OFFERING
OUR BUYERS

08:25.705 --> 08:28.775
FIVE DIFFERENT STYLE OF HOUSES.

08:30.076 --> 08:32.445

WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THE HOUSE

08:32.479 --> 08:33.880
AND HOW YOU LIKE IT
AND THIS AND THAT.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.048
- LOVE IT, DON'T LIKE IT.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.282
- WHAT'S YOUR MARKETING PLAN
NOW?

08:36.316 --> 08:37.884
- WELL, I THINK--
THIS IS THE THING, GUYS.

08:37.917 --> 08:40.353
WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING
SLIGHTLY UNEXPECTED HERE.

08:40.387 --> 08:41.721
JUST LIKE I DID IN BROOKLYN,

08:41.755 --> 08:43.323
WE'RE GONNA MARKET IT
TO MANHATTANITES.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.391
- OKAY.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.392
- AND ON TOP OF THAT,

08:45.425 --> 08:46.493
IF WE CAN ADD SERVICES,

08:46.526 --> 08:48.628
LIKE CONCIERGE SERVICES,
TO THE PROJECT,

08:48.661 --> 08:51.064
THEN WE REALLY SPEAK TO A LOT
OF THE BUYERS IN MANHATTAN.

08:51.097 --> 08:53.233
'CAUSE THEY'RE USED TO
24-HOUR DOORMEN.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.101
THEY HAVE A GYM IN THE BUILDING.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.103
WE'RE GONNA ADD
ALL THOSE LAYERS TO IT.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.738
I SELL IN NEW YORK,

08:58.772 --> 09:01.374
WHERE WE HAVE
FULL-SERVICE DOORMEN BUILDINGS

09:01.408 --> 09:04.010
WITH SWIMMING POOLS
AND JUICE BARS AND GYMS.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.779
BUT WHEN YOU BUY
A FREESTANDING HOUSE

09:05.812 --> 09:07.781
IN THE HAMPTONS,

09:07.814 --> 09:09.115
YOU DON'T GET ANY OF THAT.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.218
MY IDEA IS TO PROVIDE
FIVE-STAR CONCIERGE SERVICES

09:12.252 --> 09:15.155
TO EVERYONE WHO OWNS
A PROPERTY HERE.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.223
LIKE,
IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.591
- I LIKE IT.
I LIKE IT.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.560
- OKAY.
- ARE WE GONNA DO THIS TOGETHER?

09:20.593 --> 09:21.561
- WE ARE.

09:21.594 --> 09:23.029
MUAH.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.431
- OKAY, TEAM HAMPTONS.
LET'S DO THIS.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.566
- OKAY, LET'S DO IT.
- WE GOT THIS.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.034
- 37 HOMES.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.803
THIS IS GONNA GET REALLY HOT.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.504
SO HOT.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.773
- IT DOESN'T FEEL TO ME
THAT YOU GENUINELY WANT TO HELP.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.609
IT'S DISGUSTING, AND I'VE HAD
ENOUGH OF THIS THING.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.044
YOU.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.820
[phone line ringing]

09:46.853 --> 09:47.821
- HELLO?

09:47.854 --> 09:49.389
- RONITA.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.390
- WHAT'S UP?

09:50.423 --> 09:51.391
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:51.424 --> 09:52.459
LISTEN, CLEAR MY SCHEDULE.

09:52.492 --> 09:53.626
I'M GOING TO 75 WALL.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.061
THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT

09:55.061 --> 09:56.329
IS REALLY
WHERE MY HEART BELONGS,

09:56.363 --> 09:58.665
AND MY NEW PENTHOUSE LISTING
AT 75 WALL STREET

09:58.698 --> 10:00.066
GOT ME EXTREMELY FIRED UP.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.901
BUT THERE'S A CHALLENGE.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.503
IT'S AN UNUSUAL LAYOUT.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.305
THE LAYOUT IS EXTREMELY UNIQUE
AND SPECIFIC,

10:05.338 --> 10:07.374
SO I HIRED
THE BEST INTERIOR DESIGNER

10:07.407 --> 10:08.641
IN NEW YORK CITY
TO MAKE IT LOOK

10:08.675 --> 10:10.810
EXTREMELY SEXY
AND SOPHISTICATED.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.847
- I SEE SIMPLE
BUT EXTREMELY ELEGANT.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.915
MIRROR, LACQUER, LEATHER.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.550
- SO NOW THE PLACE IS ALL DONE.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.652
I AM HEADED TO THE PENTHOUSE
TO SHOW MICHAEL MY MAGIC.

10:19.686 --> 10:22.055
[cell phone jingling]

10:22.088 --> 10:24.190
OH.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.558
JANET.

10:25.592 --> 10:26.626
IT IS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

10:26.659 --> 10:27.894
- HI, LUIS.
HOW ARE YOU?

10:27.927 --> 10:28.995
- JANET.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.600
- I'M VERY WELL.
HOW ARE YOU?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.248
- OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.549
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME, REALLY.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.332
- OH, MY GOD.
- IS THAT AMAZING?

11:06.366 --> 11:08.935
- I WANT TO PRICE THIS UNIT
7.8 MILLION.

11:08.968 --> 11:10.904
- THE TIMING IS UP.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.907
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.676
- WOW, JANET.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.578
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.231
- OKAY.

11:38.264 --> 11:41.001
OKAY, WELL...

11:41.101 --> 11:43.403
8.4 MILLION?

11:43.436 --> 11:45.105
I MEAN,
THE MARKET IS DOING VERY GOOD,

11:45.105 --> 11:46.539
BUT I WASN'T ABLE
TO SELL THIS LISTING

11:46.573 --> 11:48.375
AT $7.8 MILLION
THREE MONTHS AGO.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.777
SO IT'S GOING TO BE
A HUGE CHALLENGE.

11:50.810 --> 11:51.778
THANK YOU SO MUCH, JANET.

11:51.811 --> 11:54.114
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.548
I WILL GO GET THEM.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.919
- TALK TO YOU SOON.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.422
[sighs]

12:02.455 --> 12:03.423
YES!

12:03.456 --> 12:05.558
[laughs]

12:16.736 --> 12:17.704
- HELLO.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.905
- YOU'RE LATE.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.373
- IT'S REALLY HARD
TO FIND THIS PLACE.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.408
I DON'T GO TO A LOT
OF DANCE STUDIOS.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.842
- HOW'S MY APARTMENT GOING?

12:22.876 --> 12:24.177
- APARTMENT'S GOOD.
THAT'S WHY I WAS LATE.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.311
YOUR APARTMENT.
IT'S GOOD.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.780
I'M WORKING
ON MY MARKETING STRATEGY

12:26.813 --> 12:27.781
FOR THE ORION,

12:27.814 --> 12:30.583
BUT TODAY,
MY DANCE LESSONS START.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.419
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY DANCED
BEFORE.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.354
I WENT TO A DANCE
WHEN I WAS IN SEVENTH GRADE,

12:34.387 --> 12:36.690
BUT I ONLY WENT THERE
TO MAKE OUT WITH A GIRL.

12:36.723 --> 12:37.691
AND IT WORKED...

12:37.724 --> 12:39.292
- [laughs]

12:39.325 --> 12:41.461
- BUT I DIDN'T, LIKE, WOO HER
WITH MY DANCE MOVES THOUGH.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.130
- SO WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU WOO HER WITH?

12:44.164 --> 12:45.131
- MY PENIS.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.833
JUST KIDDING.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.368
NOT IN SEVENTH GRADE.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.203
THAT WAS EIGHTH GRADE.

12:50.236 --> 12:51.204
SO LET'S DO THIS.

12:51.237 --> 12:52.205
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

12:52.238 --> 12:53.340
- ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.442
I CAME UP WITH AN IDEA
TO SURPRISE EMILIA

12:55.475 --> 12:57.977
WITH A BIG DANCE NUMBER
IN CENTRAL PARK.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.080
I SPEND SO MUCH TIME WORKING.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.183
IT'S ABOUT TIME
I DO SOMETHING FOR HER.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.718
- WELL, FIRST I WANT TO SEE
HOW YOU MOVE.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.186
TRY IT.
DO IT.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.687
FACE THE MIRROR.

13:07.721 --> 13:08.755
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT IS.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.057
- [laughs]

13:11.057 --> 13:13.226
DA, DA, DA.

13:13.259 --> 13:14.260
[whooshes]

13:16.863 --> 13:18.298
- ANDREW IS AN EXPERT DANCER.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.367
LEGS.
- UH-HUH. MM-HMM.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.368
- YOU SEE THAT?

13:21.401 --> 13:22.669
I DANCE LIKE A BANANA.

13:22.702 --> 13:23.770
- HERE.
- OH.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.071
- THAT GOES HERE,
THAT GOES HERE.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.072
- I'M GOING WHICH WAY?

13:26.106 --> 13:27.173
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- LIKE THIS?

13:27.207 --> 13:28.375
- SHOULDER HERE,
HIP IS HERE.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.510
- I HAD TO PUT MY HIPS
FROM HERE

13:30.543 --> 13:33.079
TO, LIKE, THERE.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.280
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.482
- NOW BRING YOUR FEET TOGETHER.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.483
[both chuckle]

13:36.516 --> 13:37.484
- [grunts]

13:37.517 --> 13:38.685
- I THOUGHT
YOU WENT TO THE GYM.

13:38.718 --> 13:39.753
- THEN MY LEG IS, LIKE, HERE,

13:39.786 --> 13:40.920
AND MY OTHER LEG IS HERE.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.088
AND THEN MY ARMS ARE THIS WAY,

13:42.088 --> 13:43.123
MY SHOULDERS HAVE TO BE BACK,

13:43.156 --> 13:44.424
AND THE BODY HAS TO BE
THIS WAY,

13:44.457 --> 13:46.259
AND...
[stammers]

13:46.292 --> 13:47.260
- SO HOW ABOUT THIS?

13:47.293 --> 13:48.261
WE'RE GONNA GO...

13:48.294 --> 13:49.262
[whooshes]

13:49.295 --> 13:50.930
- [chuckling]
NO.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.098
- COME ON.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

13:52.098 --> 13:53.266
- YEAH.

13:53.299 --> 13:54.768
JUST HAVE TO LOOK COOL
WHILE YOU'RE DOING THIS.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.102
- SO YOU'RE LIKE,
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, RIGHT?

13:56.136 --> 13:57.737
LIKE THAT?
[groans]

13:57.771 --> 14:00.473
- NO.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.742
TURN AND THEN GO DOWN.

14:02.776 --> 14:03.910
- BAM!

14:03.943 --> 14:05.745
- SHE'S NOT GONNA BE IMPRESSED.
AGAIN. GO.

14:05.779 --> 14:07.480
- THIS IS, LIKE,
THE WAX ON, WAX OFF PART

14:07.514 --> 14:09.416
OF<i>KARATE KID,</i>RIGHT?

14:09.449 --> 14:11.317
- ALL RIGHT,
BACK TO THE BEGINNING.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.925
- OKAY,
EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE PERFECT.

14:18.958 --> 14:19.926
WHAT'S THIS?

14:19.959 --> 14:21.294
CAN YOU...

14:21.327 --> 14:22.562
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.663
THE STAKES ARE HIGHER

14:23.697 --> 14:25.065
THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN HIGH,
RIGHT?

14:25.098 --> 14:30.303
WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF BROKERS
COMING FROM ALL OVER MANHATTAN.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.638
BECAUSE I'M MARKETING
BARN & VINE

14:31.671 --> 14:32.772
TO MANHATTANITES,

14:32.806 --> 14:35.442
MY IDEA HERE IS TO THROW
A BIG, SPLASHY PARTY

14:35.475 --> 14:36.810
IN MANHATTAN.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.745
DON'T YOU FEEL IT?
DON'T YOU FEEL YOUR HEART BEAT?

14:38.778 --> 14:40.947
BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM,
BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.082
AND THE GOAL IS SIMPLE:

14:42.115 --> 14:44.384
TO BUILD BUZZ
FOR THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT.

14:46.252 --> 14:47.287
HI, HOW ARE YOU?
WELCOME.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.621
WELCOME TO BRIDGEHAMPTON.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.622

14:49.656 --> 14:52.525
- MUAH.
MUAH, MUAH.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.461
ISN'T THIS EXCITING?
BRIDGEHAMPTON.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.096
WE'RE CALLING IT
BARN & VINE.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.697
WITH 37 LOTS.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.599
THEY'RE BETWEEN 1/2 ACRE
TO 1 ACRE EACH.

14:59.632 --> 15:00.667
- WOW.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.035
- AND IT'S
A REALLY UNIQUE PROJECT

15:02.035 --> 15:03.203
IN THE SENSE
THAT YOU GET TO PICK

15:03.236 --> 15:04.871
BETWEEN FIVE DIFFERENT STYLES
OF HOUSES.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.107
THEY'RE ABOUT 7,000 SQUARE FEET
EACH.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.075
- I'M SO EXCITED.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.410
WHOO!

15:10.443 --> 15:11.611
IT WAS LIKE
I COULD TAKE A KNIFE

15:11.644 --> 15:13.113
AND CUT THE ROOM
WITH ALL THIS HYPE.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.582
- FREDRIK,
I NEED TO INTRODUCE YOU

15:15.615 --> 15:16.883
TO SOME POTENTIAL...

15:16.916 --> 15:18.084

IT'S GREAT TO MEET YOU.

15:19.552 --> 15:20.887

- THEY'RE VERY, VERY INTERESTED
IN LOT EIGHT OR NINE.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.857
- I'M A POTENTIAL SELLER.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.925
AND WE'RE GONNA MAYBE DO
A POTENTIAL DEAL TOGETHER.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.861
- NOW, LISTEN, THEY'VE
BEEN LOOKING FOR ONE YEAR.

15:27.894 --> 15:30.296
- HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED A LOT
ON OUR SITE MAP YET?

15:31.931 --> 15:33.233
- OR NINE.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.368
- WE LIKE THE HIGH TOPOGRAPHY.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.070
- YOU WALKED IT?
- NO, BUT I--

15:37.070 --> 15:38.738
- OKAY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.407
- I'M YOUR HAMPTONS GAL, HONEY.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.542
OF COURSE I WALKED IT WITH THEM.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.277
- OOH.
[exhales]

TERRY'S A VERY AGGRESSIVE,

15:49.649 --> 15:51.384
DO YOU LIKE THE MOST?

15:51.418 --> 15:52.585
I LOVE THE GAMBREL.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.920
- THEY WERE ALL ABOUT,

15:53.953 --> 15:56.556
"I WANT A GAMBREL.
I WANT A GAMBREL."

15:56.589 --> 15:59.259
- SOMETIMES SHE CAN GET
IN MY WAY A LITTLE BIT.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.028
- WE REALLY LOVE THE IDEA
OF THE PRIVATE BEDROOM.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.630
- I CALL IT THE SECOND MASTER.
I LOVE THAT.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.299
- SO MAYBE WE COULD, YOU KNOW,
HAVE SOME TIME OVER THERE.

16:06.332 --> 16:07.600

16:07.634 --> 16:09.903

16:16.443 --> 16:17.610
THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.746
THINK ABOUT THE SERVICES.
YOU HAVE A FAMILY.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.181
YOU NEED HELP IN YOUR LIFE.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.582
- A BABYSITTER.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.751
THERE YOU GO.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.358

16:31.391 --> 16:33.493
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TRYING
TO DO OUT THERE

16:33.526 --> 16:35.395
IS VERY DIFFERENT

16:35.428 --> 16:37.764
THAN ALL THE OTHER
NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.467
SO CHEERS FOR BARN & VINE.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.212
[all cheer]

16:53.380 --> 16:55.849
- TODAY IS THE BIG DAY.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.919
- I AM FREAKING OUT.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.298
- I HAVE PUT A LOT OF WORK
INTO REDESIGNING THE PENTHOUSE

17:12.332 --> 17:13.400
AT 75 WALL STREET.

17:13.433 --> 17:14.934
I DIDN'T JUST FURNISH
THIS APARTMENT.

17:15.035 --> 17:15.935
I WENT ALL-OUT.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.537
I BROUGHT FURNITURE, ART,

17:17.570 --> 17:18.838
CHANDELIERS, DETAILS.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.040
I CREATED A LIFESTYLE.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.143
- WOW.
- OH, THERE HE IS.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.711
- OH, MY GOD.

17:24.744 --> 17:25.812
JEEZ.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.514
IT LOOKS INCREDIBLE.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.224
- YOU SEE,
WE WENT A LITTLE DARK.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.292
- IT'S SEXY.

17:39.325 --> 17:40.627
- IT IS VERY SEXY.
THAT'S THE IDEA.

17:40.660 --> 17:41.761
- I CAN'T GET OVER IT.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.363
IT LOOKS LIKE
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PLACE.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.065
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
I'M ACTUALLY VERY EXCITED.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.066
LET ME SHOW YOU THE REST.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.934
SO THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.969
BOOM.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.406
- WOW, NICE.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.407
LOOK AT THAT.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.408
- IT'S AMAZING, RIGHT?

17:55.442 --> 17:58.078
- I LOVE IT.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.579
- LOOK AT THIS.
THIS IS THE OFFICE.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.448
- WOW.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.684
THIS IS THE ROOM.

18:04.718 --> 18:06.286
- THIS IS THE RISKIEST THING
I'VE DONE,

18:06.319 --> 18:09.089
BECAUSE I TURNED IT
VERY, VERY DARK.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.091
BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE LAYOUT
OF THIS PENTHOUSE,

18:11.124 --> 18:12.859
MY DESIGNER AND I
HAD TO GO TO THE EXTREME.

18:12.892 --> 18:16.329
WE CHOSE VERY DARK WALL COLORS
AND COLORFUL FURNITURE

18:16.363 --> 18:18.465
IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO ENVISION

18:18.498 --> 18:20.133
HOW AWESOME THIS PLACE
REALLY IS.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.134
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.535
- LUIS, I GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.037
YOU MADE THIS LOOK
LIKE A PENTHOUSE.

18:24.037 --> 18:25.605
- OH, WELL, IT IS--
YEAH.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.340
- YOU DID AN AMAZING JOB.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.442
- THIS APARTMENT LOOKS AMAZING.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.444
THIS APARTMENT SMELLS LIKE SEX.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.514
NOW WE JUST GOT TO SELL IT.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.054
- THANK YOU, EVERYONE,
FOR STAYING LATE.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.857
WE JUST LISTED THE ORION 56C.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.426
I FINALIZED MY PLAN
FOR SELLING ANDREW'S APARTMENT,

18:46.459 --> 18:49.095
AND TONIGHT, WE EXECUTE IT.

18:49.129 --> 18:54.634
THE ORION IS SURROUNDED BY CARS
AND TOURISTS AND BUSES.

18:54.668 --> 18:57.404
A REAL NEW YORKER IS NOT
GONNA BUY IN TIMES SQUARE.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.605
BUT YOU KNOW WHO WILL?

18:58.638 --> 18:59.673
FOREIGN INVESTORS.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.307
INSTEAD OF HOSTING THE APARTMENT

19:01.341 --> 19:02.876
ON THE INTERNET
LIKE EVERY OTHER BROKER

19:02.909 --> 19:05.211
AND JUST WAITING FOR SOMEONE
TO COME AND BUY IT,

19:05.245 --> 19:07.147
WE'RE GOING TO ATTACK
THE MARKET

19:07.180 --> 19:08.448
ON THEIR HOME FRONT, RIGHT?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.717
SO WE'RE GONNA CALL
EVERY BROKER THAT WE CAN.

19:10.750 --> 19:14.354
SO WE'RE GONNA HIT
BEIJING, HONG KONG, SHANGHAI.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.690
OBVIOUSLY DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO KNOW MANDARIN.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.091
SO SINCE YOU'RE CALLING
HONG KONG,

19:18.124 --> 19:19.793
THERE'S A LOT
OF ENGLISH SPEAKERS THERE.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.394
AND IF THEY DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH,

19:21.428 --> 19:24.364
ELLA AND YAN ARE HERE
TO HELP TRANSLATE

19:24.397 --> 19:25.665
SO THAT WE CAN GET
AS MANY PEOPLE

19:25.699 --> 19:27.033
ON THE PHONE AS POSSIBLE.

19:27.067 --> 19:28.835
IT'S JUST ABOUT 11:00 P.M. HERE,

19:28.868 --> 19:31.905
SO THAT MEANS THAT IT'S JUST
ABOUT 11:00 A.M. THERE,

19:31.938 --> 19:33.173
SO WE SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.275
- YEAH!
- ALL RIGHT.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.876
I CONVINCED ANDREW
TO LIST IT LOWER

19:36.910 --> 19:39.245
BECAUSE I TOLD HIM
I WAS GONNA BID THE PRICE UP.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.848
I MEAN, I NEED A NUMBER
AS CLOSE TO 1.9 AS POSSIBLE.

19:41.881 --> 19:45.785
THERE ARE SO MANY NUMBERS
TO DIAL.

19:45.819 --> 19:47.787
BUT I DON'T EVEN HAVE
THESE BUYERS IN FRONT OF ME.

19:47.821 --> 19:49.222
WE'RE DOING THIS
ALL OVER THE PHONE.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.890

IS GONNA BE HERE.

20:02.936 --> 20:07.674
- [speaking foreign language]

20:07.707 --> 20:09.509
- I DON'T HEAR
ENOUGH PHONE CALLS OUT THERE.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.877
IS EVERYONE WORKING?

20:10.910 --> 20:15.015
MY OFFICE EXCELS AT TARGETING
SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHICS.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.786
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.221
- SHE SAID SHE'S INTERESTED.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.622
- IT'S LIKE GUERRILLA MARKETING.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.058
OH, HE'S ON TWO PHONES.
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO SEE.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.597

20:34.567 --> 20:37.370

WHAT'S GOING ON.

[both speaking foreign language]

20:43.410 --> 20:44.377
HEY, RYAN.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.847

SHE WOULD BE OUT
IN THE HAMPTONS

21:23.783 --> 21:24.951
DOING THE SHOWINGS,

21:24.984 --> 21:27.387
BUT IN THE EVENT

21:27.420 --> 21:29.122
SHE WILL CALL ME.

21:30.256 --> 21:31.324

21:41.234 --> 21:43.937

WE'RE GONNA GO AT FULL ASK.
WE'RE GONNA GET THIS DONE.

21:46.172 --> 21:47.140
NO.

21:47.173 --> 21:48.875
I AM NOT NEGOTIATING
ON THESE DEALS.

21:48.908 --> 21:52.212
THIS IS THE HAMPTONS,
AND WE ARE NOT NEGOTIATING HERE.

21:57.617 --> 22:00.053
- WAIT, WHAT?
FIVE FIREPLACES IN A HOUSE?

22:00.086 --> 22:01.254
HELLO.

HI, LOVE.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.467

22:14.501 --> 22:15.669
I LOVE YOU,

22:15.702 --> 22:17.137
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE
A LOT OF WRINKLES

22:17.170 --> 22:18.471
IN ALL THESE DEALS.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.340
NO, NO, NO.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.741
TERRY, DON'T FORGET,

22:21.775 --> 22:24.944
FREDRIK EKLUND

SO ARE YOU SITTING DOWN?

22:31.551 --> 22:34.387
YOUR OFFER HAS BEEN ACCEPTED.

22:34.421 --> 22:35.388
I KNOW, IT'S INCREDIBLE.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.456
BUT, YOU KNOW--
ONE THING.

22:36.489 --> 22:37.857
ONE THING.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

22:37.891 --> 22:38.925
BEFORE YOU JUMP UP AND DOWN,

22:38.958 --> 22:40.727
THIS POOL HOUSE--
THINK ABOUT IT.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.262
YOU DON'T WANT A POOL HOUSE,
BECAUSE--

22:42.295 --> 22:43.596
THE REASON
WHY YOU'RE BUYING LOT EIGHT

22:43.630 --> 22:45.532
IS BECAUSE IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
AND BIG.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.300
YOU DON'T NEED
FIVE FIREPLACES.

22:47.334 --> 22:49.002
THE HOUSE COMES
WITH TWO FIREPLACES.

22:49.102 --> 22:50.236
YOU ALSO HAVE CENTRAL HEATING.

22:50.270 --> 22:52.572
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK
INTO A GUESTHOUSE.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.140
YOU'RE RUINING YOUR OWN VIEW.

22:54.174 --> 22:56.743
YOU KNOW,
LAST TIME I CHECKED ON GOOGLE,

22:56.776 --> 22:59.446
CLEANING A CHIMNEY
IN THE HAMPTONS

22:59.479 --> 23:02.515
IS $900

23:02.549 --> 23:03.683
PER HOUR.

23:03.717 --> 23:04.884
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

23:04.918 --> 23:06.419
BUT LET'S NOT TALK TOO MUCH
ABOUT THAT.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.588
LET'S CELEBRATE
THE MOST AMAZING THING HERE.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.124

23:26.306 --> 23:28.274

23:28.308 --> 23:29.275
- FREEZE.

23:29.309 --> 23:31.244
- BUT, LIKE ALL SELLERS,

23:31.277 --> 23:34.881
ANDREW NOW WANTS
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.150
HE WANTS AT LEAST 1.85,

23:37.183 --> 23:38.885
SO I'M WORKING
ON GETTING THAT FOR HIM

23:38.918 --> 23:40.754
WHILE ALSO WORKING
ON MY DANCE ROUTINE.

23:40.787 --> 23:41.755

WHO'S ON MY TEAM,

23:47.427 --> 23:49.295
IS A BIT OF A DANCE MASTER
HIMSELF.

23:49.329 --> 23:50.296

23:50.330 --> 23:52.265

NATALIA.

23:52.298 --> 23:53.800
SO I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO REHEARSE WITH THEM

23:53.833 --> 23:54.968
WHEN ANDREW'S NOT AVAILABLE.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.202
[groans]

23:56.236 --> 23:57.737
- TRY HARDER, RYAN.
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

23:57.771 --> 23:58.838
- I AM TRYING HARDER.
- YEAH.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.040
- A LITTLE BIT HARDER.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.308
- I'M GONNA LIGHT UP
THAT DANCE FLOOR

24:02.342 --> 24:04.044
WITH FIRE UNDER MY FEET.

24:04.044 --> 24:07.213
DID YOU SEND THE EMAIL

TALKING ABOUT THAT.

24:41.214 --> 24:42.515
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOUR RONDE.

24:42.549 --> 24:44.084
YOUR RONDE LOOKS GOOD.

24:44.084 --> 24:45.552

REMEMBER WHEN YOU SAID
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU,

25:20.687 --> 25:21.654
THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU?

25:21.688 --> 25:23.089
SHE HAS NO IDEA

25:23.123 --> 25:24.190
WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

25:24.224 --> 25:25.759
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.

25:25.792 --> 25:26.860
- OH, MY GOD.

"LET'S HUG IT OUT.
I'M SO SORRY."

34:13.486 --> 34:15.822
LISTEN, I'M PAST THAT, YOU KNOW?

34:15.855 --> 34:17.624
YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU--
I'LL BE VERY HONEST.

34:17.657 --> 34:19.159
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS,
FREDRIK?

34:19.192 --> 34:21.361
YOUR PROBLEM--I THINK IT IS
THAT YOU DON'T COME THROUGH.

34:21.394 --> 34:22.962
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS,
WHEN WE HAD THE 50 LISPENARD

34:23.063 --> 34:24.664
AND THEN WE HAD THE THING
IN PARK SLOPE,

34:24.698 --> 34:26.066
YOU NEVER CAME THROUGH
IN THE END.

34:26.066 --> 34:27.567
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS GUY.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.568
- LUIS.
- THIS GUY--

34:28.601 --> 34:29.602
HOLD ON. LET ME SPEAK.

34:29.636 --> 34:31.071
THIS GUY AND I
HAD OUR DIFFERENCES.

34:31.071 --> 34:33.440
HE CAME ALONG WITH A BUYER,
DID A DEAL WITH ME,

34:33.473 --> 34:34.674
AND HE CAME THROUGH.

34:34.708 --> 34:35.742
YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT, TO ME,

34:35.775 --> 34:37.510
MAKES HIM A BETTER BROKER
THAN YOU.

34:37.544 --> 34:39.446
HE CAME THROUGH WITH HIS WORD,
AND YOU NEVER HAVE.

34:39.479 --> 34:41.247
- WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?
WHAT'S--

34:41.281 --> 34:42.315
WHY IS HE EVEN IN THE ROOM?

34:42.349 --> 34:44.150
LAST TIME, YOU TOLD ME
THAT HE PUSHED

34:44.184 --> 34:45.685
A POCKET SQUARE IN YOUR MOUTH.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.754
THAT'S THE LAST TIME
YOU EVER MENTIONED THIS PERSON.

34:47.787 --> 34:48.988
- YEAH, BUT SINCE THE BEGINNING,

34:49.089 --> 34:50.657
YOU HAVE BEGGED ME AND BEGGED ME
TO HELP ME.

34:50.690 --> 34:51.825
I'VE NEVER ASKED YOU FOR HELP.

34:51.858 --> 34:52.826
YOU BEGGED ME TO HELP ME.

34:52.859 --> 34:53.860
IF YOU WERE TO HELP ME,

34:53.893 --> 34:55.261
YOU WOULD NEVER CALL ME
"LITTLE LUIS."

34:55.295 --> 34:56.796
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS A DRAMA.

34:56.830 --> 34:59.099
LISTEN, IT DOESN'T FEEL TO ME
THAT YOU GENUINELY WANT TO HELP,

34:59.099 --> 35:00.066
UNDERSTAND?

35:00.100 --> 35:01.534
AND IT'S DISGUSTING.

35:01.568 --> 35:04.170
IT'S DISGUSTING, AND I'VE HAD
ENOUGH OF THIS THING.

35:04.204 --> 35:05.739
YOU.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.041
- WHOA.

35:08.041 --> 35:09.642
LUIS IS ACTING
LIKE A SPOILED CHILD.

35:09.676 --> 35:12.679
I MEAN, I WORK SO HARD FOR ALL
MY BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS,

35:12.712 --> 35:14.147
AND HE'S ANGRY AT ME

35:14.180 --> 35:17.751
FOR INTRODUCING HIM
TO ONE OF MY DEVELOPERS?

35:17.784 --> 35:20.453
TALK ABOUT ENTITLEMENT.

35:20.487 --> 35:21.688
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?

35:21.721 --> 35:25.759
I MEAN, SINCE YOU'RE
IN THE ROOM, I MEAN--

35:25.792 --> 35:28.762
- THE MORE CONTROL
FREDRIK HAS OVER LUIS,

35:28.795 --> 35:31.731
THE LESS OF A THREAT
LUIS IS TO FREDRIK'S BUSINESS

35:31.765 --> 35:33.333
NOW AND IN THE LONG TERM.

35:33.366 --> 35:34.334
THAT'S IT.

35:34.367 --> 35:35.402
- LET'S NOT CREATE A SCENE.

35:35.435 --> 35:37.270
LET'S GO--
LET'S GO OUTSIDE.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.072
- YOU KNOW WHY
THINGS GO SO SOUTH?

35:39.072 --> 35:42.475
HIS APPROACH IS NOT GENUINE.

35:42.509 --> 35:44.177
'CAUSE IF IT WAS,
I WOULD HAVE FELT THAT,

35:44.210 --> 35:47.881
AND I WOULD'VE NEVER GOTTEN
UPSET TO ANYTHING.

35:47.914 --> 35:49.849
- I DON'T GET YOU, LUIS.
I TRY TO HELP.

35:49.883 --> 35:50.984
YOU HAVE ME.
- [stammers]

35:51.084 --> 35:53.753
- IF I HAD ME 12 YEARS AGO--
YOU HAVE ME.

35:53.787 --> 35:56.089
LIKE, USE ME AS KNOWLEDGE.
I'M NOT TRYING TO--

35:56.122 --> 35:58.391
- YOU ARE SO CAUGHT UP
WITH YOUR OWN [bleep], FREDRIK.

35:58.425 --> 35:59.926
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE BUSINESS.

36:00.026 --> 36:01.828
IT'S THE ESSENCE
OF HOW IT HAPPENED.

36:01.861 --> 36:03.229
YOUR REAL INTENTIONS,
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

36:03.263 --> 36:04.431
- WHAT IS MY REAL INTENTION?

36:04.464 --> 36:06.032
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
YOUR REAL INTENTION IS.

36:06.032 --> 36:07.934
- WHAT IS MY REAL INTENTION?
TELL ME--NO, 'CAUSE I'M SO--

36:08.034 --> 36:09.202
- YOU ARE SO--
LET ME TELL YOU.

36:09.235 --> 36:12.038
YOU ARE SO CAUGHT UP
WITH YOUR SUCCESS IN REAL ESTATE

36:12.038 --> 36:13.573
THAT YOU WANT TO "HELP"

36:13.606 --> 36:15.642
JUST TO CONVINCE YOURSELF
THAT YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

36:15.675 --> 36:17.444
BUT YOU'RE DOING IT FOR YOU.

36:17.477 --> 36:19.479
I DON'T EVEN KNOW--
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW

36:19.512 --> 36:22.382
IF THAT'S HOW YOU TREAT DEREK.

36:22.415 --> 36:24.417
IF THAT'S THE REASON WHY
YOU'RE EVEN WITH HIM,

36:24.451 --> 36:27.454
I FEEL BAD FOR HIM TOO.

36:29.856 --> 36:32.058
- IT'S ONE THING TO SAY,
"I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP."

36:32.058 --> 36:33.393
THIS IS SOMETHING
VERY DIFFERENT.

36:33.426 --> 36:36.730
THIS IS A PERSONAL ATTACK
AGAINST ME, MY FAMILY.

36:39.299 --> 36:40.467
I WONDER--

36:40.500 --> 36:42.402
I WONDER WHERE
ALL THIS IS COMING FROM,

36:42.435 --> 36:45.872
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE LUIS.

36:45.905 --> 36:46.873
- IT'S SO SWEET AND TANGY.

36:46.906 --> 36:48.775
- YEAH?

36:48.808 --> 36:50.176
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

36:50.210 --> 36:51.845
WE WERE GONNA START AND DO
THIS FREAKING THING TOGETHER.

36:51.878 --> 36:53.713
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TRYING TO TEACH YOU.

36:53.747 --> 36:55.682
- YOU'RE NOT HELPING ME
YOU'RE DIS-HELPING ME.

36:55.715 --> 36:57.484
- THE PROBLEM WITH YOU,
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

36:57.517 --> 36:58.585
YOU WANT TO MAKE IT.

36:58.618 --> 36:59.919
YOU WANT TO JUMP FROM HERE
UP TO HERE.

37:00.020 --> 37:01.755
GO JUMP.
DO IT.

37:01.788 --> 37:03.123
I'M NOT GONNA BE YOUR PARTNER.

37:03.156 --> 37:05.091
I'M GONNA BE YOUR COMPETITOR.

37:05.125 --> 37:06.459
THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT IT?

37:06.493 --> 37:10.230
THAT'S THE WAY
YOU WANT IT.

37:11.331 --> 37:13.667
- WHAT A WEAK PIECE OF [bleep].

37:13.700 --> 37:15.902
FREDRIK IS THE TOP BROKER
IN THE WORLD,

37:15.935 --> 37:18.738
BUT TO ME,
HE IS THE BIGGEST BITCH.

37:18.772 --> 37:20.707
AND IT'LL GROW INTO SOMETHING
THAT ONE DAY

37:20.740 --> 37:23.710
WILL MAKE ME GO CRAZY.

37:23.743 --> 37:26.379
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I AM WHEN I GO CRAZY.

37:26.413 --> 37:29.049
GET YOUR [bleep] TOGETHER.
GET YOUR [bleep] TOGETHER.

37:29.082 --> 37:30.383
[bleep] THIS GUY.

37:30.417 --> 37:32.385
- IT'S NOT VERY WISE,
WHAT HE DID TONIGHT.

37:32.419 --> 37:34.320
HE WANTS TO MAKE ME AN ENEMY?

37:34.354 --> 37:36.589
LIKE, WITH HIM, RYAN,
THE TWO OF THEM?

37:36.623 --> 37:37.590
SO BE IT.

37:37.624 --> 37:39.559
HE JUST MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE

37:39.592 --> 37:41.795
OF HIS ENTIRE CAREER.

37:41.828 --> 37:45.598
I THINK HE'S GONNA BE SURPRISED.

37:45.632 --> 37:47.834
[sighs]
THIS DOESN'T END HERE.

37:47.867 --> 37:50.870
IT'S ACTUALLY
JUST THE BEGINNING.

38:03.616 --> 38:05.785
- THEY'RE BUYING THE BORDEAUX,
LOT 27.

38:05.819 --> 38:06.853
$4 MILLION, RIGHT?

38:06.886 --> 38:08.021
YEAH.

38:08.021 --> 38:09.823
LUIS REALLY CROSSED A LINE
LAST NIGHT

38:09.856 --> 38:10.824
OUTSIDE HIS PARTY.

38:10.857 --> 38:12.425
BUT I CAN'T LET THAT GET TO ME.

38:12.459 --> 38:13.927
I HAVE A NEW DEVELOPMENT
TO SELL,

38:14.027 --> 38:16.262
AND THAT'S WHERE I NEED
TO PUT MY FOCUS.

38:16.296 --> 38:17.831
BUT IT'S NOT DONE
UNTIL IT'S DONE.

38:17.864 --> 38:18.832
BYE, LOVE.

38:18.865 --> 38:20.033
STAY WARM.

38:20.066 --> 38:21.601
AH.

38:21.634 --> 38:23.036
SO, BABE,

38:23.069 --> 38:25.372
WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL
OUT THERE.

38:25.405 --> 38:28.541
I'VE BEEN THINKING...

38:28.575 --> 38:31.845
REMEMBER THAT FIRST HOUSE
WHEN WE CAME TO THE HAMPTONS?

38:31.878 --> 38:33.046
- YEAH.

38:33.079 --> 38:37.117
- WHAT IF YOU AND I
WOULD JUST BUY ONE?

38:37.150 --> 38:38.518
- WHAT?

38:38.551 --> 38:42.856
- TO HAVE A RETREAT
FROM THE CITY.

38:42.889 --> 38:44.257
- ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS?

38:44.290 --> 38:45.558
- THINK ABOUT IT.

38:45.592 --> 38:50.530
THE WHOLE LOWER RECREATION LEVEL
IS 1,884 SQUARE FEET.

38:50.563 --> 38:52.665
THAT WHOLE LEVEL HERE,
YOU COULD JUST PAINT.

38:52.699 --> 38:54.534
- OH, GOD,
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE.

38:54.567 --> 38:56.236
I MEAN, I'M IN SHOCK,

38:56.269 --> 38:57.737
BUT, YEAH, I'D LOVE IT.

38:57.771 --> 38:59.072
I MEAN, DEFINITELY.

38:59.105 --> 39:00.674
- YOU KNOW,
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL,

39:00.707 --> 39:02.642
I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER
WITH DEREK.

39:02.676 --> 39:05.011
LIKE, OUR RELATIONSHIP,
OUR MARRIAGE IS AMAZING.

39:05.045 --> 39:07.580
WE'VE HAD SOME DISAGREEMENTS
THIS YEAR ABOUT HAVING KIDS,

39:07.614 --> 39:10.583
BUT I'M PROUD OF DEREK
AND HIS CAREER.

39:10.617 --> 39:12.519
I'M HERE TODAY IN MY CAREER

39:12.552 --> 39:15.155
BECAUSE I HAD THE FREEDOM
TO BUILD IT THE WAY THAT I DID.

39:15.188 --> 39:17.057
SO IF DEREK NEEDS TIME,

39:17.090 --> 39:19.192
I'M THERE TO HELP HIM
AND SUPPORT HIM

39:19.225 --> 39:20.460
AND GIVE HIM THAT TIME.

39:20.493 --> 39:22.028
AND NOW, WITH THIS HOUSE--

39:22.028 --> 39:24.364
EVEN IF IT'S ONLY ON THE
WEEKENDS, THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.

39:24.397 --> 39:26.499
BECAUSE GOD KNOWS,
MONDAY COMES,

39:26.533 --> 39:29.703
I'M GONNA WANT TO BE IN THE CITY
AND SELL.

39:35.408 --> 39:37.043
- AT THIS POINT IN MY CAREER,

39:37.043 --> 39:39.312
MY BUSINESS IS BIGGER
THAN IT'S EVER BEEN.

39:39.346 --> 39:43.216
BUT MY NUMBER ONE FOCUS
IS THE SKY GARAGE.

39:43.249 --> 39:44.451
- RYAN, THANKS FOR JOINING US.

39:44.484 --> 39:46.953
THAT IS THE MOST UNUSUAL
REAL ESTATE VIDEO

39:47.053 --> 39:47.954
I'VE EVER SEEN.

39:48.054 --> 39:49.356
AND YOU KNOW
THIS IS GONNA GO VIRAL.

39:49.389 --> 39:50.557
I MEAN, IT'S A GREAT VIDEO.

39:50.590 --> 39:52.158
RYAN, THANKS A LOT.

39:52.192 --> 39:53.793
- YOU KNOW,
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR,

39:53.827 --> 39:54.794
I WAS JUST BEING RUTHLESS.

39:54.828 --> 39:55.795
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

39:55.829 --> 39:56.796
- CAN YOU TAKE THIS GUY
OUT OF HERE?

39:56.830 --> 39:58.064
- PUT THAT IN YOUR MOUTH.

39:58.064 --> 39:59.132
- TAKE THIS GUY OUT.
- PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH.

39:59.165 --> 40:00.433
I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,

40:00.467 --> 40:01.534
THAT'S HOW YOU GOT TO DO IT
IN THIS BUSINESS.

40:01.568 --> 40:04.471
AND I SAW MYSELF
JUST GOING DOWN A PATH

40:04.504 --> 40:06.673
THAT I DIDN'T REALLY WANT
TO GO DOWN.

40:06.706 --> 40:08.208
AND AS LIFE CHANGES...

40:08.241 --> 40:09.275
- GREAT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- GREAT TO MEET YOU.

40:09.309 --> 40:10.343
THANKS FOR COMING.
- THANK YOU.

40:10.377 --> 40:12.712
- I'M REALIZING
THAT I THINK YOU CAN BE

40:12.746 --> 40:14.214
A VERY, VERY STRONG BUSINESSMAN

40:14.247 --> 40:17.450
BUT NOT BE
A TOTAL DOUCHE BAG.

40:17.484 --> 40:19.185
THAT'S NOT THE PERSON
THAT I AM.

40:19.219 --> 40:22.255
I HOPE.

40:22.288 --> 40:23.690
- HEY.

40:23.723 --> 40:25.992
- BUT EVEN THOUGH WORK IS
CRAZIER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN,

40:26.026 --> 40:27.293
WHEN I COME HOME
AND I SEE EMILIA,

40:27.327 --> 40:29.729
IT'S INCREDIBLY COMFORTING.

40:29.763 --> 40:30.730
- WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

40:30.764 --> 40:31.731
- [groans]

40:31.765 --> 40:32.732
- OOH!

40:32.766 --> 40:33.867
[chuckles]

40:33.900 --> 40:36.569
- SHE IS HOME TO ME NOW.

40:49.649 --> 40:51.184
- WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN ME AND FREDRIK,

40:51.217 --> 40:52.285
I CANNOT DWELL ON.

40:52.318 --> 40:54.287
MY FOCUS IS ON MY BUSINESS
AND NOT HIM.

40:57.424 --> 40:58.491
JANET.
- HEY THERE.

40:58.525 --> 40:59.959
HOW ARE YOU?
- VERY WELL.

41:00.060 --> 41:02.362
I'VE BEEN WORKING SO HARD
ON SELLING 75 WALL STREET,

41:02.395 --> 41:04.564
AND AT THE SAME TIME,
I'VE BEEN WORKING EQUALLY HARD

41:04.597 --> 41:06.766
ON SELLING 30 LINCOLN PLAZA
FOR JANET AND THE MILSTEINS.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.301
IT'S A 4 BEDROOM,
4 1/2 BATHROOM,

41:08.335 --> 41:09.469
2,700 SQUARE FEET.

41:09.502 --> 41:12.372
WE JUST RAISED THE PRICE
FROM 7.8 TO 8.4 MILLION

41:12.405 --> 41:13.373
BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE

41:13.406 --> 41:14.708
THAT HAS BEEN SOLD
IN THE BUILDING

41:14.741 --> 41:16.443
HAS SOLD FOR OVER $3,100 A FOOT.

41:16.476 --> 41:18.211
- SO THE WEST SIDE'S
COME A LONG WAY.

41:18.244 --> 41:19.512
- OH, YES.

41:19.546 --> 41:21.348
AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,
THEN GIVE ME A CALL.

41:21.381 --> 41:23.083
HOPEFULLY,
WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

41:23.083 --> 41:25.151
-<i>SALUD,</i>GENTLEMEN.
-<i>SALUD.</i>

41:25.185 --> 41:26.586
- AND AFTER ONLY THREE WEEKS,

41:26.619 --> 41:28.621
I HAVE AMAZING NEWS
TO GIVE HER.

41:28.655 --> 41:30.657
IT'S BEEN SUCH A RIDE, YOU KNOW,
WITH UPS AND DOWNS

41:30.690 --> 41:33.193
AND DISAPPOINTMENTS OF MYSELF.

41:33.226 --> 41:36.463
BUT TODAY, I HAVE WHAT I BELIEVE
ARE VERY GOOD NEWS.

41:36.496 --> 41:37.497
- OKAY.
I'M LISTENING.

41:37.530 --> 41:40.200
- AS OF LAST NIGHT,
I GOT AN OFFER

41:40.233 --> 41:43.303
AT $8.5 MILLION,

41:43.336 --> 41:45.772
ALL CASH, CLOSING IN 30 DAYS.

41:45.805 --> 41:47.207
- WOW.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.408
- [laughs]

41:48.441 --> 41:50.543
- WOW, THAT IS AWESOME.

41:50.577 --> 41:53.113
OH, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

41:53.146 --> 41:55.215
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS WAS A HELL OF A YEAR.

41:55.248 --> 41:56.282
- THAT WAS AWESOME.

41:56.316 --> 41:57.751
- I HAVE MET INCREDIBLE PEOPLE,

41:57.784 --> 41:58.852
INCREDIBLE FRIENDS.

41:58.885 --> 42:00.153
- YES!
[both laughing]

42:00.186 --> 42:02.555
- AND THIS YEAR,
I WAS DEDICATED

42:02.589 --> 42:04.157
TO START BUILDING
THAT CREDIBILITY

42:04.190 --> 42:05.692
