00:01.168 --> 00:04.069
- Check it out, romance stories
set in a firehouse.

00:04.071 --> 00:07.339
- Can you imagine the hellfire
of crap I'd get

00:07.341 --> 00:10.242
if anyone around here found out
I was doing this?

00:10.244 --> 00:14.213
- What do you say we write
together and go get published?

00:14.215 --> 00:15.631
- You know I love you

00:15.632 --> 00:17.048
and I support you
no matter what you do.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.051
<i> Maybe I can scale back</i>
<i> at work and--</i>

00:19.053 --> 00:21.754
- no. You can't force yourself
into wanting this right now

00:21.756 --> 00:24.490
just because
of how much I do.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.795
- Okay, stuffed animal,
sippy cup.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.064
You are all set, buddy.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.365
You can take him to lunch
after you pick him up,

00:33.367 --> 00:35.401
but please,
no drive-through.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.137
- What? I'm dropping him off.
Bonnie's picking him up.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.139
- No, no, I told you
that I canceled bonnie

00:40.141 --> 00:42.091
because you're free.

00:42.092 --> 00:44.042
- Uh, you didn't tell me,
and I'm not free.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.045
I took the shift off
to check out this warehouse.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.780
- Well, you told me it would
only take a few hours.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.514
That's plenty of time to pick up
louie at 1:00. Perfect.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.483
- I'm playing golf at 1:00.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.959
What?

00:59.960 --> 01:02.161
- Didn't mean to interrupt.
You ready to go?

01:02.163 --> 01:03.595
- Yeah. Casey was
just about to say

01:03.597 --> 01:05.364
how he's gonna cancel
his golf game

01:05.366 --> 01:07.266
so he can pick louie up
later.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.401
- I'll be in the car.

01:12.373 --> 01:15.374
- Guess I'll play golf
another time.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.508
Better get going.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.158
- Alderman casey.
- Hey.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.861
- Gary melville.
Thanks for coming out.

01:35.863 --> 01:38.263
- Thanks for opening up
your warehouse on a Saturday.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.399
- It's no problem.
Although I thought the contract

01:40.401 --> 01:42.267
was a done deal.
I mean, we do have

01:42.269 --> 01:44.870
the best decontamination
supplies in chicago.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.839
- Vote's all set
for Monday.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.807
I just heard no one had been by
to actually look things over.

01:48.809 --> 01:52.878
- Huh. Well, who better than a
real chicago firefighter, right?

01:52.880 --> 01:55.214
Come on in.

01:56.183 --> 01:57.883
- This way.
Come on.

01:57.885 --> 02:01.520
No, no, hold it there for a sec.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.889
- You machine
your own aluminum?

02:03.890 --> 02:06.257
- Oh, absolutely, we manufacture
all of our decontamination pools

02:06.260 --> 02:08.627
on site, so we can supply
emergency response

02:08.629 --> 02:10.629
to any hazmat situation.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.132
As you can see,
we keep the frames folded

02:13.134 --> 02:15.334
for easy transport--

02:15.336 --> 02:17.302
hey, I've got
all those specs

02:17.304 --> 02:19.605
that you were looking for
over here in my office.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.406
- You always have kids
hanging around here?

02:21.408 --> 02:23.375
- That's laurel;
that's ken's daughter.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.911
- Hi.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.512
- I could've stayed home,
but no.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.581
Stuck here doing
slave labor.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.917
- Don't wanna paint,
don't get grounded.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.219
Get back in the break room.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.355
- Whatever.

02:40.194 --> 02:42.161
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch out!

02:42.163 --> 02:44.163
- Oh, god!

02:49.637 --> 02:52.204
- Milo, look out!

02:52.206 --> 02:54.473
- Ah, ah, ah! Ah!

02:54.475 --> 02:56.308
[screaming]

02:56.310 --> 02:57.409
- what the hell?

02:57.411 --> 03:02.581
- [screaming]

03:03.951 --> 03:05.517
[screaming]

03:05.519 --> 03:06.885
- what the hell?

03:06.887 --> 03:08.687
- [screaming]

03:20.968 --> 03:22.167
.

03:22.168 --> 03:23.367
- [groaning]

03:28.375 --> 03:29.975
- you gotta get away
from these fumes!

03:29.977 --> 03:31.910
Run outside and call 911!

03:31.912 --> 03:33.245
- Right!

03:35.216 --> 03:36.315
- [groans]

03:36.317 --> 03:37.316
- dad?

03:37.318 --> 03:38.984
Wait, what happened?

03:38.986 --> 03:41.220
- An accident.
Your dad inhaled some fumes.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.454
- Huh?

03:42.456 --> 03:44.356
- We gotta block that off,
or we're dead.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.626
Here, use this.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.328
You need to to cut up
this drop cloth

03:49.330 --> 03:53.632
in wide pieces, roll 'em up,
stuff 'em underneath.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.400
Got that?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.436
Here, take it.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.571
Go. Now.
- Okay.

04:04.545 --> 04:05.677
- [mumbles]

04:15.289 --> 04:16.421
[grunts]

04:34.675 --> 04:35.741
- is he okay?

04:35.743 --> 04:38.043
- His acid burns
aren't too bad.

04:38.045 --> 04:41.680
He's breathing on his own,
which is a good sign.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.816
Gary's calling 911,
so the medics will be here soon.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.722
- Wait.
Where's milo?

04:50.724 --> 04:52.624
Is he still out there?

04:52.626 --> 04:56.295
- Your dad's forklift ran
into a tank of something toxic.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.030
My guess is
sulfuric acid.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.798
- Is he--

04:59.800 --> 05:00.999
- he didn't make it.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.734
- Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.336
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey, wait.
- Oh, my god, oh, my god,

05:04.337 --> 05:05.937
oh, my god, oh, my god!
- Hey, hey, hey.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.538
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, laurel.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.341
Right?
- Yeah.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.677
- My name's matt casey.
I'm a firefighter.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.478
I know you're freaked out,
but we're safe in here

05:13.480 --> 05:16.348
for the moment.
What I need you to do

05:16.350 --> 05:19.384
is sit with your dad
and keep an eye on him for me.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.453
Can you do that?

05:24.591 --> 05:26.625
Okay, good.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.561
- Daddy?
[sighs]

05:45.846 --> 05:48.113
- what in god's name
is that?

05:48.115 --> 05:51.116
- This is beef jerky mac.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.051
- That, my friend,
is disgusting.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.354
- Oh, this is the food
of the future.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.689
It's packed
with lean protein.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.460
You just add water.
Best science has to offer.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.561
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

06:02.563 --> 06:06.531
- Mmm. Delicious.
Delicious science.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.517
- Ah, leave him alone.

06:08.518 --> 06:10.502
He wants to eat
slop in a sack, let him.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.803
- Well, that wouldn't be
my choice,

06:11.805 --> 06:13.705
but we could all stand
to be more thoughtful

06:13.707 --> 06:14.906
about the food
that we eat.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.408
Good for you for trying
something new.

06:16.410 --> 06:19.711
- See?
Vision, bifocals.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.847
[phone buzzing]

06:24.485 --> 06:25.617
[presses button]

06:42.469 --> 06:44.136
oh, my breakfast is
a federal case,

06:44.138 --> 06:46.405
but that we're all
just gonna ignore?

06:46.407 --> 06:47.939
- What are those two up to?

06:47.941 --> 06:49.941
- Ignorance is bliss.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.446
- Mr. Morley.
Randy mcholland.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.481
- That is
a great author name.

06:56.483 --> 06:57.849
- [laughs]

06:57.851 --> 06:59.151
- sylvie brett.

06:59.153 --> 07:01.553
- Okay.
Can we sit?

07:06.693 --> 07:08.460
- We haven't discussed
our little project

07:08.462 --> 07:10.595
here at work yet.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.867
- [whispering] we're keeping it
"on the down low," so to speak.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.603
- Oh. Say no more.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.873
Next meeting--maggiano's.
My treat.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.442
- Wow.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.710
- So, this book,
what do you call it?

07:25.712 --> 07:27.746
- "flames of desire."
- "sheets on fire."

07:27.748 --> 07:31.516
- really?
Like "pants on fire?"

07:31.518 --> 07:34.619
- whatever it's called,
it's hot stuff.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.756
Pun intended.
[laughter]

07:37.758 --> 07:39.724
we're ready to publish.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.494
- Oh, my gosh.

07:43.530 --> 07:46.231
- Uh--
I gotta tell you,

07:46.233 --> 07:48.500
I lost track of how many queries
I sent out,

07:48.502 --> 07:51.770
but this--this makes it
all worth it.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.939
- All we need to get started
is you write me

07:53.941 --> 07:56.808
a check for $5,000.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.911
- What?
- Oh, it's totally standard,

07:59.913 --> 08:03.648
covers upfront expenses.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.784
- I'm sorry, what's the name
of your company again?

08:05.786 --> 08:10.989
- Fireworks publishing.
Best vanity press in chicago.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.029
[alarm sounding]

08:17.030 --> 08:18.530
<i> - ambulance 61,</i>
<i> injury from a fall,</i>

08:18.532 --> 08:21.600
<i> 2012 princeton ave.,</i>
<i> apartment 6.</i>

08:25.806 --> 08:30.942
[siren wailing]

08:36.683 --> 08:39.551
- so what's going on
with you and mouch?

08:39.553 --> 08:41.586
- Nothing.
He's just giving me

08:41.588 --> 08:43.688
some advice
on a business matter--

08:43.690 --> 08:46.758
some personal investments.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.793
- Okay.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.831
Pupils are normal.
- I'm fine.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.533
Just one of my dizzy spells.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.700
- Well, you had to go down
pretty hard

08:55.702 --> 08:56.902
to get a scrape
like that.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.538
- I put my hand
out to steady myself.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.706
My skin is so thin now.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.642
- It looks like
your blood pressure's running

09:03.643 --> 09:05.577
on the low end.
Do you drink enough water?

09:05.579 --> 09:07.779
- I try.
- So it's just a fall,

09:07.781 --> 09:09.014
nothing serious?

09:10.684 --> 09:12.250
Courtney jackson.
I work with the city

09:12.252 --> 09:14.619
as a senior advocate.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.955
- Courtney's a huge help.

09:16.957 --> 09:20.058
She gets me discounts
on everything. [laughs]

09:20.060 --> 09:21.760
- well, your scrape's
not too bad,

09:21.762 --> 09:24.663
but it sounds like you have
a lot of these dizzy spells.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.765
What happens when you can't
call for help next time?

09:26.767 --> 09:29.000
- Maybe I should get
one of those alert necklaces.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.803
- Hmm, well, our concern is that
we don't know if these spells

09:31.805 --> 09:33.271
are caused
by your low blood pressure

09:33.273 --> 09:34.673
or something more serious.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.075
We should get you
checked out at chicago med.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.878
- You know,
I'm feeling better.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.614
I don't need to go
to the hospital.

09:42.616 --> 09:45.717
- Can we speak
over here?

09:52.759 --> 09:54.125
I'm here to make sure
our seniors aren't

09:54.127 --> 09:56.995
bullied into something
they don't want.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.397
- Bullied?

09:58.398 --> 09:59.798
- We just want what's best
for the patient.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.900
- I get that, but margot's
mentally competent

10:01.902 --> 10:04.769
to make her own decisions,
and it's my job to support her.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.339
- Are you with her
24 hours a day?

10:07.341 --> 10:09.475
You going to make sure
she's drinking enough water

10:09.476 --> 10:11.610
to keep her blood pressure up?
If this is even because of that.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.079
If she's having multiple falls,
she shouldn't be living alone.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.748
- I'll make a note
of that opinion.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.884
I'm sure margot will call
if she needs help again.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.966
- You can't get
a signal in here.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.801
Trust me, I've tried.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.938
- We should be hearing
sirens by now.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.844
Grounded, huh?

10:45.846 --> 10:48.947
- I snuck out,
stayed out late.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.815
- How late is "late"?

10:50.817 --> 10:51.883
- 1:00 in the morning.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.686
- Yeah.
I'm team dad on that one.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.388
What are you, 14?
- 15.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.923
He's out late
all the time, working.

10:58.925 --> 11:02.694
Can't believe he even noticed
I was gone...Or cared.

11:02.696 --> 11:05.997
- He's your dad.
Of course he cares.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.366
- You know who says
stuff like that?

11:08.368 --> 11:10.368
People whose dads
took them fishing a lot.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.805
- Actually, my dad died when
I was a little older than you.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.740
- Oh.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.912
My mom died last year.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.948
- I'm sorry.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.951
- Whatever. It sucks.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.189
- Yeah. It does.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.741
- What's wrong?

11:49.743 --> 11:52.744
- I was just checking to see
how things were out there.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.080
- I know what it looks like
when grown-ups lie.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.951
- [sighs]

11:59.953 --> 12:01.886
looks like gary tried to go
back to his office

12:01.888 --> 12:03.455
before he went outside.

12:03.457 --> 12:04.489
- Why would he do that?

12:04.491 --> 12:05.790
- Probably to get rid
of the records

12:05.792 --> 12:08.193
of what he was up to here.
The point is

12:08.195 --> 12:10.929
the fumes got him.
He never called 911.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.734
- Nobody's coming.
- Nope.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.337
- Oh, god.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.030
.

12:29.031 --> 12:30.013
- He'll be safer here.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.816
- [moans]
- dad?

12:31.818 --> 12:34.953
- [breathes unevenly]

12:38.058 --> 12:40.091
[breathes unevenly]

12:43.263 --> 12:44.496
- what's that?

12:44.498 --> 12:46.531
- Baking soda helps
neutralize the acid.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.032
- [gasps]
- it won't work for long.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.834
- [coughs]

12:49.836 --> 12:52.036
- dad? Daddy?

12:52.038 --> 12:55.173
- [mumbling]

12:55.175 --> 12:57.108
oh.
- [laughs] dad!

12:57.110 --> 12:59.511
- What happened?
- Forklift pierced a tank.

12:59.513 --> 13:02.313
- Oh! [groans]
- come on.

13:02.315 --> 13:06.818
- Oh, god. Oh, god.
- Easy, take it easy.

13:06.820 --> 13:11.055
- Gary said to stack the drums
high enough to hide the tanks.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.558
- I'm guessing he doesn't have
a permit to store sulfuric acid.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.060
- The guy never met
a corner he couldn't cut.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.563
He's making cash on the side
storing the tanks for a friend.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.465
- And you brought me here?

13:20.467 --> 13:23.568
- What was I supposed to do,
leave you at home alone?

13:23.570 --> 13:26.204
- Guys, what's on the other side
of this vent?

13:26.206 --> 13:28.573
- Office.
- With a landline?

13:28.575 --> 13:29.874
- Yeah.

13:49.563 --> 13:53.531
- [groans]

13:53.533 --> 13:56.835
[exhales sharply]

13:56.837 --> 13:58.102
[inhales]

13:58.104 --> 13:59.204
- what the hell
are you doing?

13:59.206 --> 14:00.305
- [surprised gasp]

14:03.210 --> 14:04.309
how long have you all
been here?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.144
- So, what's going on here?

14:06.146 --> 14:08.847
Are you having
a mental event of some sort?

14:11.184 --> 14:13.318
- [sighs]

14:19.159 --> 14:22.327
I got shortlisted
for mission: Mars.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.598
[laughter]

14:28.201 --> 14:30.501
it's a privately funded project
to train and send civilians

14:30.503 --> 14:35.940
to form the first human habitats
on mars, and I made the top 100.

14:35.942 --> 14:38.443
- Yeah, he did! Ha ha!
- There he is!

14:38.445 --> 14:39.944
- There he is!
- Ah.

14:39.946 --> 14:43.147
- Your application
must have been...Impressive.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.183
- I wrote a great
personal essay, okay?

14:45.185 --> 14:48.653
And cruz here helped me
bring it to tip-top shape.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.954
- You encouraged this?

14:49.956 --> 14:52.123
- He asks, I help.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.325
- Anyway, they sent over
a list of tasks

14:54.327 --> 14:55.960
for ultimate mission fitness.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.962
- And putting together a fan

14:57.964 --> 15:00.131
while holding your breath
was on it?

15:00.133 --> 15:01.599
- Repairing
an oxygen filtration system

15:01.601 --> 15:03.368
in case of critical error.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.504
[laughter]
- okay.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.517
- [grunts]

15:19.519 --> 15:20.585
[groans]

15:20.587 --> 15:22.553
[panting]

15:22.555 --> 15:24.989
we need to widen this up
if I'm gonna get through.

15:24.991 --> 15:27.458
- Or I could go.
- No way.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.927
- I can fit.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.596
All I have to do is call 911,
right?

15:31.598 --> 15:32.997
- Yeah.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.466
- I can do it.

15:37.971 --> 15:41.205
- Okay. Just go in,
use the phone, come back.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.674
- Okay.

15:42.676 --> 15:45.276
- Laurel.
[groans]

15:47.013 --> 15:48.179
- [grunts]

15:48.181 --> 15:49.180
[coughs]

15:49.181 --> 15:50.180
- wait, wait, wait.
- [coughing]

15:50.183 --> 15:52.383
- wait, come back,
come back.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.420
Okay. Hold on.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.389
[camera snap]

15:58.391 --> 16:04.429
the fumes are already in there.
We need to seal this off.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.510
- Mr. Casey.

16:20.714 --> 16:23.448
- Perfect.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.583
Yeah, hold this.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.095
Two more.
Here.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.074
- What is it?
What is it?

16:53.646 --> 16:55.246
- Nothing.
- The hell it is.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.082
What is it?

16:58.084 --> 17:01.386
- The acid's moving toward
a pile of aluminum shavings.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.971
- So?

17:02.972 --> 17:04.555
- When sulfuric acid
touches aluminum,

17:04.557 --> 17:06.024
there's a chemical reaction.

17:08.061 --> 17:11.162
Acid hits those shavings,
there's gonna be an explosion.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.132
We gotta get out of here.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.438
- I mean, golf?
Really?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.540
And then for him to have
the nerve to be annoyed with me,

17:22.542 --> 17:25.276
to tell me I didn't tell him
that I canceled bonnie?

17:25.278 --> 17:27.278
- Dawson, no offense.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.280
Maybe you should be
talking to casey.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.682
- [laughs]
what am I supposed to say?

17:31.684 --> 17:34.385
"I'd rather you not prioritize
a golf game over our kid?"

17:34.387 --> 17:35.420
I mean, I kind of thought
that was implied.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.388
- Okay, take a breath.
Hang on.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.458
- [sighs]

17:40.460 --> 17:42.126
- now, do you really think
that casey cares

17:42.128 --> 17:45.129
more about golf than louie?

17:45.131 --> 17:46.831
- No.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.433
But I did tell him.

17:48.435 --> 17:52.170
- He forgot.
You both have a lot going on.

17:55.842 --> 17:59.710
- This is the first time
that louie saw us fight.

17:59.712 --> 18:04.115
- If that's a fight,
he'll be fine.

18:06.619 --> 18:07.752
- [chuckles]

18:10.490 --> 18:12.523
[alarm blaring]

18:12.525 --> 18:13.958
<i> - ambulance 61.</i>
- Thank you.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.392
<i> - Elderly person injured</i>
<i> from fall,</i>

18:15.395 --> 18:17.762
<i> 2012 princeton ave,</i>
<i> apartment 6.</i>

18:17.764 --> 18:20.731
[siren wailing]

18:24.737 --> 18:27.405
- I heard a thump and I knocked
and I got no answer,

18:27.407 --> 18:29.607
so I used my key.
Is she okay?

18:29.609 --> 18:32.343
- I'm fine.
Just a little bump.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.878
- You're gonna have to get
some stitches.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.814
- Call courtney.
- I already did.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.516
- Just pop a bandage on it.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.585
- You already fell once,
and now you got a head injury.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.619
We gotta take you
to a trauma center.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.521
It's protocol.

18:43.522 --> 18:45.422
- I want to go to northside,
not chicago med.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.858
- Rules are we have to take you
to the nearest hospital.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.360
- I don't want to go
to a strange doctor

18:49.362 --> 18:53.397
who doesn't know my history.
They know me at northside.

18:53.399 --> 18:56.868
They have...All my--my--my--
records.

18:56.870 --> 18:58.402
- Let's just see if we--

18:58.404 --> 18:59.904
- she's out.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.707
- [gagging]

19:07.647 --> 19:09.097
.

19:09.098 --> 19:10.548
- [gagging]

19:16.222 --> 19:19.790
- margot? Margot?

19:19.792 --> 19:24.662
Margot, see if you can follow
my finger with your eyes.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.532
- Try not to talk, sweetie,
just look at gabby's finger.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.168
- Great.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.903
See if you can squeeze
both my hands, honey.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.943
We gotta move.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.645
- What's wrong?
What happened?

19:40.647 --> 19:43.781
- She had a stroke
is what happened.

19:45.418 --> 19:50.621
- She's had a t.I.A. Before.
Her neurologist is at northside.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.857
- Northside is ten minutes
farther away.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.959
- She has a request
on file.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.862
It's my responsibility
to speak for her.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.830
- You can speak for her
at med.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.609
- For you.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.778
My department chief
with a direct order

20:13.780 --> 20:16.447
to transport margot
to northside.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.350
- Oh. Great.
Let me talk to him.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.855
We're going to med.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.767
- What are you doing?

20:36.768 --> 20:38.668
- This pipe goes
clear through to the next room.

20:38.671 --> 20:42.773
[grunts]
if I get a little leverage--

21:02.328 --> 21:04.729
[grunting]

21:09.769 --> 21:10.901
- mr. Casey?

21:12.672 --> 21:14.805
- Give me a hand.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.008
Just hold that.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.776
- [coughs]

21:18.778 --> 21:21.879
- [panting]

21:21.881 --> 21:22.913
- you all right, ken?

21:22.915 --> 21:25.516
- I'm just--[groans]
a little winded.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.818
- Dad?
- Why don't you lie down,

21:27.820 --> 21:29.287
rest for a minute?

21:29.289 --> 21:31.956
- [groans]
[coughs]

21:31.958 --> 21:34.659
- all right.
- Dad? Are you okay?

21:34.661 --> 21:35.926
- [breathing heavily]

21:35.928 --> 21:38.062
- dad?

21:38.064 --> 21:40.598
- Laurel.
Give me your shirt.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.866
- Okay.

21:43.803 --> 21:44.935
- Here.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.638
- [coughs]
- it's okay.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.907
Okay, give me your hand.
- [groans]

21:49.909 --> 21:53.044
- it'll make you
feel better, ken.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.315
- What?

21:57.317 --> 22:00.451
- [panting]

22:02.822 --> 22:04.855
- okay.
I want you to tie this

22:04.857 --> 22:08.726
around your dad's face
and mouth, like a mask.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.094
- Okay.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.329
- Here.
- Okay.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.464
- Oh.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.906
- Lunch already?

22:55.908 --> 22:59.043
- Yeah, lasagna
or chicken à la king.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.462
Frankly, I'm thinking
about doubling up,

23:01.463 --> 23:03.880
because that beef jerky mac
just did not stick to the ribs.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.783
- Funny you should say that.
I've been reading up

23:05.785 --> 23:09.019
on alternate protein sources,
and--

23:09.021 --> 23:11.021
- cricket protein powder.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.723
- It makes any food
more filling,

23:12.725 --> 23:15.459
and I guess you can raise
crickets in zero gravity,

23:15.461 --> 23:17.061
so endless food supply.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.398
- Interesting,
and...Disgusting.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.133
- Nah, man, look.
"virtually tasteless

23:22.135 --> 23:24.068
in a smoothie or shake."
- huh.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.170
- You should give it a try.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.873
- Okay. Thanks.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.976
- No problem.
- [groans]

23:35.047 --> 23:37.047
- you're telling me
that getting treatment started

23:37.049 --> 23:38.983
ten minutes earlier
didn't make a difference?

23:38.985 --> 23:39.984
'cause I heard
she already started

23:39.986 --> 23:41.869
recovering movement.
- No.

23:41.870 --> 23:43.753
What I'm telling you is that
I find it hard to believe

23:43.756 --> 23:45.656
that there's no way
to achieve that result

23:45.658 --> 23:47.658
without destroying
a city employee's property.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.795
- I didn't destroy her property.
I dropped it. It slipped.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.164
- My life was so much easier
when you were a firefighter,

23:53.166 --> 23:55.132
and here you are,
back on ambo,

23:55.134 --> 23:57.468
raising my blood pressure
one shift at a time.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.470
- If doing right by my patient--
- I'm not disputing

23:59.472 --> 24:00.838
your medical judgment.
I'm just saying

24:00.840 --> 24:02.506
there's better ways
to go do things.

24:02.508 --> 24:04.809
- Well, maybe I just don't have
your gift of diplomacy.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.911
- Gabby.

24:06.913 --> 24:10.815
Brett, what's your take
on the situation?

24:14.821 --> 24:16.821
- I stand by my partner.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.924
- This is par for the course
with dawson,

24:19.926 --> 24:22.193
but I expected better
of you, brett.

24:22.195 --> 24:25.062
I'm sorry to hear my confidence
has been misplaced.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.935
You can both go.

24:42.548 --> 24:44.548
- Welcome to the troublemaker
list, girl.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.884
- Don't ever put me
in that position again.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.519
- Oh, come on,
hatcher's just a blowhard

24:48.521 --> 24:50.087
who's pissed he's gotta do
more paperwork.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.857
- Well, I'm not like you, gabby.
I like following the rules.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.191
I like being liked
by my boss.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.627
Showdowns with hatcher
aren't exactly fun for me.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.865
- You're right.
I'm sorry.

25:00.867 --> 25:04.869
It's just...That guy just
really pushes my buttons.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.270
But, you got to admit,
it was kind of fun

25:06.272 --> 25:08.973
watching him get all red.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.542
[text alert chimes]

25:11.544 --> 25:12.877
uh, louie's daycare.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.912
- Go for it.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.748
- Hello?

25:17.750 --> 25:20.885
No, uh, no,
it should've been matt casey.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.022
You couldn't?

25:25.024 --> 25:28.125
[chuckles]
okay, I'm sorry.

25:28.127 --> 25:30.261
I'll call his sitter.
She'll be right there.

25:30.263 --> 25:32.897
[beeps]

25:32.899 --> 25:36.200
bonnie, hey. I'm gonna need you
to pick up louie after all.

25:37.570 --> 25:42.873
- [grunting]

25:57.256 --> 25:58.956
- mr. Casey?

26:00.026 --> 26:02.693
The acid's hitting the shavings.
It's hissing.

26:31.657 --> 26:37.061
- [grunting]

26:38.898 --> 26:42.132
[grunting loudly]

26:53.346 --> 26:55.312
[grunting]

27:00.086 --> 27:04.054
- [gasps]
[coughing]

27:04.056 --> 27:05.689
[grunting]

27:05.691 --> 27:08.392
- dad?
Daddy? Daddy!

27:08.394 --> 27:10.728
- [grunting]

27:15.167 --> 27:16.433
.

27:16.434 --> 27:17.700
- Laurel,
I need you to see

27:17.703 --> 27:19.169
if you can fit
through that hole.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.171
- But--
[pop and air escaping]

27:21.173 --> 27:22.272
is that the explosion?

27:22.274 --> 27:24.408
- No, that would be louder,

27:24.410 --> 27:26.176
but I need you to tell me
what's happening in there.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.344
- [sighs]

27:27.346 --> 27:28.345
- [inhales sharply]

27:28.347 --> 27:29.647
- okay, okay.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.281
- [inhales sharply]

27:34.286 --> 27:36.286
[electrical wires sparking
and popping]

27:36.288 --> 27:38.322
- the box on the wall
is shooting sparks everywhere!

27:38.324 --> 27:40.724
- Laurel, listen,

27:40.726 --> 27:44.161
the acid's hitting the conduit
on the warehouse floor.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.929
I need you to go
through that hole,

27:45.931 --> 27:47.998
go out the door,
and call 911.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.433
- What?

27:49.435 --> 27:51.101
What about my dad?

27:51.103 --> 27:54.304
- I need to stay here
to help him.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.006
It has to be you.
- No, no, no, no.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.441
No, I can't do that,
I can't leave him,

27:57.443 --> 27:59.243
not after my mom--
- laurel.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.345
I'm sorry about your mom.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.681
It's not fair you have to worry
about your dad, too.

28:04.417 --> 28:06.250
Nobody else is dying today.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.355
Not if you do
what I'm asking you.

28:12.291 --> 28:15.025
- [sighs] okay.

28:15.995 --> 28:19.196
- Here, use this.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.330
Cover your head with it,
it'll shield you

28:20.332 --> 28:23.701
from the sparks.
- Okay.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.302
After your dad died,

28:25.304 --> 28:27.337
did your mom still make you
act like a family?

28:27.339 --> 28:30.107
- Not exactly.

28:30.109 --> 28:33.077
- Dad made us have
these family dinners.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.211
God, I hated them.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.980
- Laurel,
we're out of time.

28:36.982 --> 28:40.117
- If he wakes up, can you
tell him dinners weren't so bad?

28:42.455 --> 28:43.487
- I'll tell him.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.423
[explosion]

28:46.425 --> 28:49.093
we're out of time!
Go! Go! Now!

28:49.095 --> 28:52.763
- [sobbing] okay.
Okay, okay.

28:52.765 --> 28:54.331
Okay.

28:57.503 --> 28:58.836
[groans]

29:05.444 --> 29:07.377
[screams]

29:07.379 --> 29:08.812
- how you doing, laurel?

29:11.117 --> 29:13.016
- I'm good!

29:13.018 --> 29:14.218
[electrical wires sparking]

29:15.988 --> 29:18.088
- okay.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.516
- [panting]

29:49.155 --> 29:50.254
[explosion]

29:55.327 --> 29:56.493
[grunts]

30:00.866 --> 30:02.833
- this isn't over.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.801
We just need to do a rewrite,
send more queries.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.804
- Oh, and meet
more scam artists?

30:06.806 --> 30:11.241
- Maybe...We need more...
Interpersonal conflict.

30:11.243 --> 30:14.912
- We're conflicting right now.
You think it's sexy?

30:16.248 --> 30:18.315
- I will quit right now

30:18.317 --> 30:20.250
if you can look me in the eye
and tell me

30:20.252 --> 30:23.387
this hasn't been the most fun
you've had all year.

30:27.459 --> 30:31.195
- Okay, what if the ambo
partners are really different?

30:31.197 --> 30:33.597
One is a wholesome good girl,

30:33.599 --> 30:37.367
and the other's rebellious
and feisty and--

30:37.369 --> 30:38.902
- they make out?

30:38.904 --> 30:40.604
- They clash.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.906
But they ultimately realize
that their differences

30:42.908 --> 30:44.875
make them great.

30:44.877 --> 30:47.477
- And then they make out.

30:47.479 --> 30:48.912
- Hey.
You mind if we go for a ride?

30:48.914 --> 30:51.281
- Sure. Sure,
what is it?

30:51.283 --> 30:52.349
- Probably nothing.
I just want to make sure that--

30:52.351 --> 30:53.917
[alarm blaring]

30:53.918 --> 30:55.484
<i> - truck 81, ambulance 61,</i>
<i> squad 3.</i>

30:55.487 --> 30:58.889
<i> Industrial accident.</i>
<i> Acid spill. 625...</i>

30:59.925 --> 31:05.262
[sirens wailing]

31:20.512 --> 31:22.179
- oh, god,
that's matt's truck.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.365
<i> - Please, hurry!</i>

31:24.366 --> 31:26.550
You guys gotta help! My dad and
mr. Casey are still inside!

31:26.552 --> 31:28.385
- Okay. You tell me
as much as you can.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.520
- There was acid.
We got stuck in the break room.

31:30.522 --> 31:32.322
Mr. Casey blew a hole
in the wall to get out,

31:32.324 --> 31:35.158
but now that room has
sparks and fire and--

31:35.160 --> 31:37.411
[sobs]
- okay, okay.

31:37.412 --> 31:39.663
Battalion 25 to main, requesting
a power shutoff at my location.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.465
Herrmann, find a way
to cut the power on site.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.301
- All right, hey, split up!
Cover the sides!

31:44.303 --> 31:45.636
Find me those meters.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.906
- Everybody mask up.

31:48.908 --> 31:51.141
Tony, capp, grab
your chemical extinguishers.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.644
Cruz, couple sledgehammers.
- On it.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.480
- Come on, let's get you
checked out.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.615
Gabby?

32:00.185 --> 32:02.352
[electrical wires sparking]

32:05.190 --> 32:06.523
- [groans]

32:08.494 --> 32:10.460
- casey!

32:10.462 --> 32:11.695
- Severide?

32:11.697 --> 32:14.164
I got fumes coming in
from the spill area!

32:14.166 --> 32:15.966
One civilian.
I had to improvise a cric!

32:15.968 --> 32:17.467
[coughs]
- all right.

32:18.604 --> 32:19.603
- You gotta make the hole
big enough

32:19.605 --> 32:21.405
to get him out
on a backboard!

32:21.407 --> 32:24.708
- Tony, capp, take
an extinguisher to that panel!

32:24.710 --> 32:27.377
Cruz, we'll use sledges
on this hole!

32:31.450 --> 32:35.585
- [screams] otis, we could
really use that power cutoff!

32:37.656 --> 32:39.022
- Truck's on it.

32:52.271 --> 32:53.470
- Pulling!

32:54.440 --> 32:55.706
- Pulling!

32:57.343 --> 32:58.442
Pulling!

33:00.579 --> 33:01.745
- [groans]

33:03.716 --> 33:06.416
[groans]
[coughs]

33:06.418 --> 33:09.619
ken, I know it's hard, but it's
better if you stay still, huh?

33:09.621 --> 33:11.588
[coughing]

33:11.590 --> 33:14.424
she's okay.
She got out.

33:15.995 --> 33:19.463
She wanted me to tell you,
she didn't mind the dinners.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.398
After we get out of here,
you should try

33:21.400 --> 33:25.135
doing those again, huh?
[coughing]

33:26.772 --> 33:28.305
- pulling!

33:28.307 --> 33:30.040
- Power should be off!

33:31.377 --> 33:33.543
- [grunts]
negative!

33:33.545 --> 33:36.446
It's still hot! We're getting
pinned down in here!

33:43.655 --> 33:45.288
- Yeah, we're gonna have to pull
the main line feed

33:45.290 --> 33:46.456
out of the meter.

34:01.306 --> 34:03.473
- You all ready?
- Yeah.

34:03.475 --> 34:06.076
- One, two, pull!

34:13.552 --> 34:14.802
.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.053
[electrical wires sparking]

34:16.055 --> 34:19.356
- [panting]

34:19.358 --> 34:20.557
- how you doing
in there?

34:21.660 --> 34:23.827
- Power's off.
We're secure.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.596
Capp, grab a backboard!

34:38.677 --> 34:42.579
- Casey, you all right?
- [coughing]

34:44.349 --> 34:47.451
- hazmat on site.
Entering building now.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.586
[sirens wailing in the distance]

34:55.594 --> 34:58.195
- daddy!

35:01.467 --> 35:03.500
- All the way up.

35:03.502 --> 35:04.701
- Pick him up there.
Pick him up.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.470
[all talking at once]
- good.

35:06.472 --> 35:07.571
- Got him?

35:10.642 --> 35:11.808
- You okay?
- I'm good.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.677
- [sighs]
- [groans]

35:13.679 --> 35:15.779
- we should get you checked out.
- I'm fine.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.481
I'm fine.

35:17.483 --> 35:19.616
[clears throat]

35:22.754 --> 35:25.622
hey.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.258
You got a great kid,
you know that?

35:31.630 --> 35:33.763
- Thank you.

35:33.765 --> 35:36.633
- [sighs]

35:36.635 --> 35:38.768
[clears throat]

35:45.577 --> 35:48.712
phew.
[panting]

35:58.223 --> 36:00.490
- what's this?
- Spicy margarita.

36:00.492 --> 36:03.727
I'm trying to convince herrmann
to put it on the menu.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.495
- It's great.
What's in it?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.531
- Right?
- No.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.699
- It's lime, tequila,
jalapeño...

36:09.701 --> 36:12.169
- Mmm.
- Couple of secret ingredients.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.603
- It's awesome.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.939
- Hey, so I have
a little bit of news.

36:15.941 --> 36:19.843
I...Am...Leaving chicago.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.797
- What?
- Yeah.

36:23.798 --> 36:25.815
I found a simulation
mission: Mars capsule

36:25.817 --> 36:27.801
in australia, right?

36:27.802 --> 36:29.786
So I'm gonna go down there
for six months, I'm gonna train.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.855
Sold all my stuff
to some guy online, he agreed

36:31.857 --> 36:33.823
to buy it, 1,500 bucks.
He's gonna come down

36:33.825 --> 36:36.493
with a truck, he's gonna
pick it up tomorrow.

36:36.495 --> 36:37.894
You need a new couch,
by the way.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.563
- Okay, no, wait,
this is nuts, man.

36:39.565 --> 36:41.464
You can't do this.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.934
- We're talking
about my dreams here.

36:43.936 --> 36:45.735
- [sighs]

36:45.737 --> 36:48.605
okay.

36:48.607 --> 36:51.708
Look, otis, I hate to say this,
man, but...

36:51.710 --> 36:53.210
I made it up.

36:53.212 --> 36:54.611
- What?
- The email,

36:54.613 --> 36:57.214
the shortlist,
I made it all up.

36:57.216 --> 36:59.516
Look, I started reading
up on this,

36:59.518 --> 37:03.220
and if you actually go,
it's literally forever.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.854
And if anything goes wrong,

37:04.856 --> 37:07.524
you get, like,
suffocated to death.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.926
Like, I thought you were gonna
see how crazy this thing is,

37:09.928 --> 37:12.729
and then just get over it,
not sell our couch--

37:12.731 --> 37:14.531
which we both bought,
by the way--

37:14.533 --> 37:16.666
and move to australia!

37:21.940 --> 37:24.307
You knew.

37:24.309 --> 37:26.876
How long?

37:26.878 --> 37:28.778
- Since the cricket powder.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.647
- [sighs]

37:30.649 --> 37:32.515
good one.

37:32.517 --> 37:34.651
- God, I'm so glad you like it,
by the way.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.656
- [gags]
yeah.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.328
- Hey, hey.
Where is she?

37:45.330 --> 37:48.865
The--that girl.
- Uh, who?

37:48.867 --> 37:51.334
- [sighs]
sylvie brett.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.739
- Huh.

37:56.942 --> 38:00.844
Do you mind explaining this text
you sent to my husband?

38:00.846 --> 38:03.647
"the girls can make out
if you want."

38:03.649 --> 38:05.348
- oh, dear lord.
- That's right, genius.

38:05.350 --> 38:07.651
You grabbed my phone
and left yours at home.

38:07.653 --> 38:11.054
- Trudy, it is--it is not
what you think.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.926
- Uh--

38:18.764 --> 38:22.299
uh, uh--

38:22.301 --> 38:25.435
we--we wrote
a romance novel.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.775
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]

38:31.777 --> 38:36.913
[all laughing]

38:39.818 --> 38:41.885
- w-we were just trying
to figure out

38:41.887 --> 38:46.022
how to spice it up to get
publishers interested.

38:50.729 --> 38:52.696
- Randall?
- Hmm?

38:52.698 --> 38:56.599
- How many times have I told you
about my college roommate lola

38:56.601 --> 39:01.104
and her husband anton's job...
In publishing?

39:01.106 --> 39:02.572
- A lot?

39:02.574 --> 39:05.675
- I can get you a read,
like that.

39:06.912 --> 39:09.112
- Well, that'd be great.

39:09.114 --> 39:13.049
Ah! Mmm. This one.

39:13.051 --> 39:16.586
- This one,
he's an idiot.

39:16.588 --> 39:17.954
- Such an idiot.

39:17.956 --> 39:23.393
<i> - Dr. Bruce, telephone please.</i>
<i> Dr. Bruce, telephone please.</i>

39:23.395 --> 39:25.695
- We're gonna screw up.

39:27.933 --> 39:32.068
You know,
the both of us.

39:32.070 --> 39:36.005
I mean, this is all
still really new.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.875
- I know.

39:38.877 --> 39:42.045
But I love you.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.382
And I'm not going
anywhere.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.919
- I love you too.

39:53.425 --> 39:56.159
You know, there are easier ways
to get me to let you play golf.
