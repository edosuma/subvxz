09:35.666 --> 09:37.000
I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE

09:37.066 --> 09:38.300
PERSPECTIVE, I THINK YOU AND I

09:38.366 --> 09:40.500
AGREE ON SO MANY THINGS, LIKE

09:40.566 --> 09:42.133
WHO IS CRAZIER, THE LEFT OR THE

09:42.200 --> 09:42.900
RIGHT?

09:42.966 --> 09:43.266
OF THE RIGHT.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.233
RIGHT THERE, YOU SHOULD BE

09:44.300 --> 09:51.300
ALLOWED IN THE NEWSROOM.

09:51.366 --> 09:51.566
[APPLAUSE]

09:51.633 --> 09:53.900
>> IT'S THE EDITORS RESPONDING

09:53.966 --> 09:56.866
TO SOCIAL MEDIA, SOCIAL MEDIA,

09:56.933 --> 09:59.033
TWITTER IS WHAT CREATES THESE

09:59.100 --> 10:00.700
ONLINE MOBS THAT CREATES THIS

10:00.766 --> 10:02.166
PRESSURE ON THE EDITORS TO FIRE

10:02.233 --> 10:02.800
INDIVIDUAL WRITERS EVEN IF THE

10:02.866 --> 10:06.100
EDITORS ARE FINE WITH THE

10:06.166 --> 10:06.666
WRITER.

10:06.733 --> 10:08.233
THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THIS IS

10:08.300 --> 10:10.066
NOT SO MUCH THE WOKE AND ONLINE

10:10.133 --> 10:12.000
MEDIA BECAUSE THEY ARE AWFUL AND

10:12.066 --> 10:13.000
THEY SHOULD BE IGNORED BUT THEY

10:13.066 --> 10:14.866
AREN'T, IT'S THE POINT OF THE

10:14.933 --> 10:16.133
PEOPLE RUNNING THESE

10:16.200 --> 10:16.800
INSTITUTIONS, LIBERAL

10:16.866 --> 10:18.566
INSTITUTIONS, UNIVERSITIES,

10:18.633 --> 10:19.933
MAGAZINES, NEWSPAPERS.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.666
THEY DON'T HAVE THE BALLS TO SAY

10:22.733 --> 10:23.500
NO, WE DO BELIEVE IN A PLURALITY

10:23.566 --> 10:25.566
OF VIEWS, WE ARE GOING TO SPEND

10:25.633 --> 10:27.600
ON POPULAR WRITERS.

10:27.666 --> 10:30.666
FREE SPEECH MEANS NOTHING.

10:30.733 --> 10:34.733
[APPLAUSE]

10:34.800 --> 10:36.666
>> Bill: AND ONE OF YOUR GREAT

10:36.733 --> 10:38.366
ARTICLES IT'S IN THE BOOK, WE

10:38.433 --> 10:40.333
ALL LIVE ON CAMPUS NOW AND YOUR

10:40.400 --> 10:41.766
POINT BEING AND I THINK IT'S

10:41.833 --> 10:42.400
COMPLETELY RIGHT THAT THE IDEAS

10:42.466 --> 10:44.733
THAT ARE COMING OUT OF

10:44.800 --> 10:47.533
ESPECIALLY ELITE UNIVERSITIES

10:47.600 --> 10:48.566
WHICH ALSO DO GOOD STUFF AND

10:48.633 --> 10:53.366
TEACH REAL SUBJECTS STILL, A LOT

10:53.433 --> 10:54.733
OF IT FILTERS DOWN.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.133
TELL US ABOUT THAT, I WOULD LOVE

10:56.200 --> 10:59.100
TO HEAR YOUR WORDS.

10:59.166 --> 11:01.433
>> THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF LOOKING

11:01.500 --> 11:04.133
AT THE WORLD AND ONE OF IT IS AS

11:04.200 --> 11:04.766
INDIVIDUALS COMING AGAINST EACH

11:04.833 --> 11:07.733
OTHER REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
OR SEX AND USING REASON TO

11:08.866 --> 11:10.200
PERSUADE EACH OTHER OR NOT

11:10.266 --> 11:11.733
PERSUADE EACH OTHER,

11:11.800 --> 11:12.800
DELIBERATING THE COMMON GOOD FOR

11:12.866 --> 11:13.266
DEMOCRACY.

11:13.333 --> 11:15.466
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT BUT WHEN

11:15.533 --> 11:17.300
YOU START DEFINING PEOPLE NOT AS

11:17.366 --> 11:19.933
INDIVIDUALS BUT AS MEMBERS OF A

11:20.000 --> 11:21.466
RACE OR AGENDA AND SAY THAT SOME

11:21.533 --> 11:26.133
RACES HAVE TO BE GIVEN MORE

11:26.200 --> 11:26.733
PREFERRED AND A SOME GENDERS

11:26.800 --> 11:28.300
HAVE TO BE MORE PREFERRED, WE

11:28.366 --> 11:29.066
CAN'T HAVE THE CONVERSATION

11:29.133 --> 11:31.133
WITHOUT HAVING THAT ALL SET OUT

11:31.200 --> 11:33.733
IN ADVANCE, THIS STARTED IN THE

11:33.800 --> 11:34.333
UNIVERSITIES, IT BECOMES

11:34.400 --> 11:37.366
OBSESSIVE IN PEOPLE'S MINDS AND

11:37.433 --> 11:39.466
NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES AND

11:39.533 --> 11:40.200
JOURNALISTS WERE DESPERATE FOR

11:40.266 --> 11:41.933
MONEY AND BROUGHT IN A WHOLE

11:42.000 --> 11:42.500
BUNCH OF VERY YOUNG PEOPLE

11:42.566 --> 11:44.266
STRAIGHT OUT OF THESE COLLEGES

11:44.333 --> 11:46.500
AND DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLS TO PUT

11:46.566 --> 11:48.600
UP WITH THEM AND ALL OF US ARE

11:48.666 --> 11:52.200
IN THIS CLIMATE THINGS LIKE DUE

11:52.266 --> 11:52.700
PROCESS, FINDING OUT IF

11:52.766 --> 11:55.366
SOMETHING IS TRUE OR NOT BEFORE

11:55.433 --> 11:56.566
YOU CONDEMN SOMEBODY, TAKING A

11:56.633 --> 11:58.633
PERSON'S WHOLE BODY OF WORK INTO

11:58.700 --> 11:59.333
ACCOUNT INSTEAD OF THINKING ONE

11:59.400 --> 12:04.066
SINGLE THING YOU'RE GOING TO GET

12:04.133 --> 12:04.866
DAMNED FOR FOREVER.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.700
YOU'RE MAKING ME OUT TO BE SOME

12:06.766 --> 12:08.000
SORT OF CRAZY RIGHT WING OR AT

12:08.066 --> 12:10.366
MY WORK.

12:10.433 --> 12:12.466
IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN

12:12.533 --> 12:13.366
THAT AND YOU MIGHT FIND YOU

12:13.433 --> 12:18.133
AGREE WITH LOTS OF IT.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.166
>> Bill: THEY USE TO AGREE

12:19.233 --> 12:20.900
WITH THAT, I KNOW YOU HAVE

12:20.966 --> 12:21.533
WRITTEN A LOT ABOUT HOW WE SEEM

12:21.600 --> 12:25.233
TO BE GIVING UP ON THE IDEA OF A

12:25.300 --> 12:26.066
COLOR-BLIND SOCIETY, WHICH USED

12:26.133 --> 12:27.733
TO BE THE GOAL.

12:27.800 --> 12:32.066
WE DIDN'T CHANGE, YOU CHANGED.

12:32.133 --> 12:33.100
I STILL THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE

12:33.166 --> 12:33.600
GOAL.

12:33.666 --> 12:36.433
>> IT IS THE GOAL, IT MUST BE

12:36.500 --> 12:37.866
THE GOAL, HUMANITY MATTERS MORE

12:37.933 --> 12:39.600
THAN THE PART OF HUMANITY WERE

12:39.666 --> 12:42.466
FROM AND AMERICA OF ALL PLACES,

12:42.533 --> 12:42.933
THE MOST MULTIRACIAL,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.400
MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY ON EARTH

12:45.466 --> 12:47.266
WILL NOT SURVIVE IF WE ARE

12:47.333 --> 12:47.900
CONSTANTLY IN WARFARE BETWEEN

12:48.000 --> 12:50.566
GROUPS OR GENDERS.

12:50.633 --> 12:56.400
[APPLAUSE]

12:56.466 --> 12:59.933
SO FOR EXAMPLE, WE SHOULD

13:00.000 --> 13:00.500
ABSOLUTELY ACKNOWLEDGE THIS

13:00.566 --> 13:04.600
COUNTRY HAS A RACIST HISTORY

13:04.666 --> 13:06.300
THAT NEEDS TO BE CONFRONTED

13:06.366 --> 13:06.866
DIRECTLY.

13:06.933 --> 13:07.333
>> Bill: AND TAUGHT IN

13:07.400 --> 13:07.566
SCHOOLS.

13:07.633 --> 13:10.300
[APPLAUSE]

13:10.366 --> 13:12.866
>> NO ONE IS AGAINST THAT AT

13:12.933 --> 13:13.533
ALL.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.166
>> Bill: THERE ARE SOUTHERN

13:15.233 --> 13:15.700
GOVERNORS.

13:15.766 --> 13:17.100
>> THERE ARE.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.266
>> Bill: BUT NO ONE WE KNOW.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.966
>> THE POINT IS YOU CAN DO THAT,

13:20.033 --> 13:22.300
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS SAY THAT

13:22.366 --> 13:25.500
IS THE SINGLE MEANING OF AMERIC

13:25.566 --> 13:26.933
AMERICA, RACIAL OPPRESSION,

13:27.000 --> 13:28.766
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.

13:28.833 --> 13:31.500
THE COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED IN 1619,

13:31.566 --> 13:33.400
NOT 1776 BECAUSE OF SLAVERY IS

13:33.466 --> 13:34.333
WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS ABOUT.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.066
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THAT,

13:36.133 --> 13:38.333
WE ARE BUT WE ARE ALSO ABOUT SO

13:38.400 --> 13:38.900
MUCH ELSE.

13:38.966 --> 13:41.533
WE ARE ABOUT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM,

13:41.600 --> 13:43.900
FREEDOM OF SPEECH, EMPOWERMENT

13:43.966 --> 13:44.233
OF MINORITIES.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.266
>> Bill: THINGS HAVE CHANGED

13:46.333 --> 13:48.733
GREATLY SINCE 1619.

13:48.800 --> 13:49.000
AND 1919.

13:49.066 --> 13:51.333
>> YOU THINK THE CHINESE ARE

13:51.400 --> 13:52.233
LESS RACIST THAN WE ARE?

13:52.300 --> 13:53.333
YOU THINK THE RUSSIANS ARE?

13:53.400 --> 13:54.166
IT'S A MIRACLE WHAT WE DO IN

13:54.233 --> 13:57.000
THIS COUNTRY.

13:57.066 --> 14:00.733
[APPLAUSE]

14:00.800 --> 14:02.900
>> Bill: WE WANT TO BEAT THEM

14:02.966 --> 14:03.500
NOT JUST AN PING-PONG BUT IN

14:03.566 --> 14:06.500
BEING LESS RACIST.

14:06.566 --> 14:09.866
I LOVE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT

14:09.933 --> 14:10.066
COVID.

14:10.133 --> 14:10.633
THESE VIRUSES CHALLENGE THE

14:10.700 --> 14:12.166
PSYCHE AND THE TRICK IT SEEMS TO

14:12.233 --> 14:14.000
ME AS NOT TO DENY THEIR POWER

14:14.066 --> 14:15.633
AND DANGER BUT TO SEE PAST THEM

14:15.700 --> 14:17.133
TO THE REAL GOAL, THE LIVING OF

14:17.200 --> 14:18.166
YOUR LIFE.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.300
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, THIS ONE

14:20.366 --> 14:22.966
VIRAL THREAT CAN CAUSE YOU TO BE

14:23.033 --> 14:25.366
PARALYZED BY EXCESSIVE FEAR AND

14:25.433 --> 14:28.133
CAUTION -- THANK YOU.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.700
WE NEED TO HEAR THIS MORE AND

14:30.766 --> 14:33.100
MORE.

14:33.166 --> 14:34.866
>> IT'S NOT TO SAY YOU SHOULD

14:34.933 --> 14:36.933
GET VACCINATED OR TAKE

14:37.000 --> 14:37.666
PRECAUTIONS, I'M TRIPLE

14:37.733 --> 14:39.066
VACCINATED, I HAVE HIV.

14:39.133 --> 14:42.400
I HAVE LIVED WITH HIV FOR 28

14:42.466 --> 14:43.700
YEARS, IT'S IN MY BONE MARROW,

14:43.766 --> 14:46.266
IT'S IN ME.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.700
I CAN WANT TO DEFEAT IT, GET RID

14:47.766 --> 14:49.666
OF IT COME OUT OF MY LIFE,

14:49.733 --> 14:50.900
CURATE, GONE FOREVER, BUT I

14:50.966 --> 14:51.633
CAN'T.

14:51.700 --> 14:52.966
SO WHAT DO I DO?

14:53.033 --> 14:54.700
I LIVE WITH IT, I MANAGE IT, I

14:54.766 --> 14:58.233
GET ON WITH MY LIFE, I SEE

14:58.300 --> 15:00.500
PEOPLE.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.433
>> Bill: YOU SHOOK MY HAND,

15:02.500 --> 15:03.500
THAT'S FUCKING RISKY, YOU DON'T

15:03.566 --> 15:07.366
KNOW WHERE MY HAND HAS BEEN.

15:07.433 --> 15:09.766
YOU SAY WE SHOULD HAVE NO -- GET

15:09.833 --> 15:10.866
RID OF ALL MASKS AND SOCIAL

15:10.933 --> 15:12.166
DISTANCING MANDATES AS LONG AS

15:12.233 --> 15:14.033
WE HAVE A VACCINE, RIGHT?

15:14.100 --> 15:15.966
>> PEOPLE SHOULD GET A VACCINE.

15:16.033 --> 15:17.433
IF THEY WANT TO WEAR MASKS,

15:17.500 --> 15:18.600
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE BUT TO BE

15:18.666 --> 15:20.833
IRRATIONAL ABOUT IT -- THE WAY

15:20.900 --> 15:23.600
WE ARE GOING TO GET PAST THIS IS

15:23.666 --> 15:25.233
VACCINES, COVID IS HERE TO STAY,

15:25.300 --> 15:26.466
IT'S ENDEMIC NOW.

15:26.533 --> 15:27.900
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE VACCINES

15:27.966 --> 15:29.500
EVERY SIX MONTHS LIKE WE DO THE

15:29.566 --> 15:29.666
FLU.

15:29.733 --> 15:32.966
IT'S A WAY TO GET US BACK IN

15:33.033 --> 15:33.166
LIFE.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.866
>> Bill: I'M NOT SURE ABOUT

15:34.933 --> 15:35.733
LIVING THAT IDEA.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.966
>> IT'S NOT SO BAD YOU GET A

15:39.033 --> 15:40.600
PRICK TWICE A YEAR, IF YOU'RE

15:40.666 --> 15:43.233
LUCKY.

15:52.533 --> 15:54.700

15:54.766 --> 15:56.166
>> Bill: I'M GOING TO ASK MAX

15:56.233 --> 15:57.433
ON THE PANEL BECAUSE HE WORKED

15:57.500 --> 15:59.233
IN GOVERNMENT ON THAT, THIS IS

15:59.300 --> 15:59.866
SUPPOSED TO BE A DIFFERENT KIND

15:59.933 --> 16:01.033
OF VACCINE.

16:01.100 --> 16:05.300
WILL NOT FIND OUT ABOUT THAT.

16:05.366 --> 16:07.800

THINGS, THE DECISION, BUT FIRST

16:54.566 --> 16:54.966
THE EXECUTION.

16:55.033 --> 16:57.366
THE EXECUTION OF HOW THE PULLOUT

16:57.433 --> 16:58.000
WAS DONE.

16:58.066 --> 17:00.166
BECAUSE WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN A

17:00.233 --> 17:03.666
GUY LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,

17:03.733 --> 17:04.600
DONALD TRUMP DONALD TRUMP GETS

IN OFFICE, THIS BUFFOON, HE'S

17:09.766 --> 17:13.066
BOTH STUPID AND CRAZY.

17:17.566 --> 17:17.933
CRAZY.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.900

17:21.966 --> 17:24.233
WORK, THEN, THANK GOD, WE

17:35.000 --> 17:36.833
DIFFERENT IF IT WAS TRUMP.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.433
HOW COULD IT BE MORE FUCKED UP?

17:39.500 --> 17:41.300
HOW COULD IT BE MORE

17:41.366 --> 17:42.766
INCOMPETENT, HOW COULD IT BE

17:42.833 --> 17:43.500
MORE TRUMP?

17:43.566 --> 17:45.233
WHAT DO I SAY TO MYSELF TO SLEEP

17:45.300 --> 17:46.400
AT NIGHT WHEN THE ADULTS ARE

17:46.466 --> 17:48.100
BACK IN CHARGE AND THEY FUCK IT

17:48.166 --> 17:50.033
UP EXACTLY AS BAD AS TRUMP

17:50.100 --> 17:52.533
WOULD?

17:52.600 --> 17:54.000
>> YOU KNOW HOW YOU ALWAYS SAY I

17:54.066 --> 17:56.166
CAN'T BELIEVE TRUMP DID THAT,

17:56.233 --> 17:56.766
NOTHING HE DID WOULD MAKE YOU

17:56.833 --> 18:00.000
THINK HE HIT BOTTOM?

18:00.066 --> 18:03.366
IT COULD BE WORSE?

18:03.433 --> 18:03.900
>> Bill: HOW?

18:03.966 --> 18:05.366
HOW COULD HE HAD MADE IT WORSE,

18:05.433 --> 18:08.033
WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN WORSE?

18:08.100 --> 18:09.400
THEY GAVE THEMSELVES MONTHS TO

18:09.466 --> 18:11.533
GET OUT, THERE ARE STILL SO MANY

18:11.600 --> 18:12.500
AMERICANS OVER THERE BECAUSE

18:12.566 --> 18:13.833
THEY THOUGHT THE AFGHAN ARMY,

18:13.900 --> 18:15.700
WHICH WE HAVE KNOWN FOR 20

18:15.766 --> 18:17.200
YEARS, WOULD STAND UP AT LEAST

18:17.266 --> 18:18.333
FOR A FEW MONTHS AND IT FOLDED

18:18.400 --> 18:21.266
IN 11 DAYS.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.500
THAT'S LIKE WHEN TYSON KNOCKED

18:22.566 --> 18:24.733
OUT THAT GUY IN 30 SECONDS.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.900
>> I'M NOT DEFENDING BIDEN, WHAT

18:26.966 --> 18:29.800
I WOULD SAY IS THIS HAS GONE TO

18:29.866 --> 18:31.933
HIS DEFINING GOAL OF HIS

18:32.000 --> 18:32.600
PRESIDENCY.

18:32.666 --> 18:36.733
THIS IS ABOUT MAKING US ALL SEE

18:36.800 --> 18:40.833
THAT DEMOCRACIES -- AS

18:40.900 --> 18:42.066
AUTOCRACIES ARE RISING AROUND

18:42.133 --> 18:43.266
THE WORLD, DEMOCRACIES CAN DO

18:43.333 --> 18:44.666
BIG THINGS AND DO THEM WELL.

18:44.733 --> 18:46.633
HE STARTED TO SHOW THAT WITH THE

18:46.700 --> 18:48.733
COVID VACCINATION MOBILIZATION

18:48.800 --> 18:50.900
AND THEN HE'S BLOWN IT IN A

18:50.966 --> 18:51.100
WEEK.

18:51.166 --> 18:53.200
>> LET ME SAY THIS TO START OFF

18:53.266 --> 18:57.000
I SPENT MY LIFE IN AFGHANISTAN

18:57.066 --> 18:57.333
AFGHANISTAN --

18:57.400 --> 19:00.700
[APPLAUSE]

19:00.766 --> 19:02.766
THE SCARS OF THAT WAR ON MY BODY

19:02.833 --> 19:05.300
AND MY SOUL, I'M GETTING TEXT

19:05.366 --> 19:06.933
MESSAGES FROM MY BUDDIES, THIS

19:07.000 --> 19:07.900
IS A LITTLE TRIGGERING.

19:07.966 --> 19:09.833
THERE IS THIS SENSE OF WHAT IS

19:09.900 --> 19:10.833
THIS ALL FOR?

19:10.900 --> 19:12.500
I DO WANT TO ADD A THIRD THING

19:12.566 --> 19:13.500
TO WHAT SHE SAID WHICH IS WE

19:13.566 --> 19:14.933
NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MEN AND

19:15.000 --> 19:16.500
WOMEN WHO SERVED THERE FOR 20

19:16.566 --> 19:18.700
YEARS, THEY DID SOMETHING, THEY

19:18.766 --> 19:19.733
PROTECTED US.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.400
WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE CAN'T

19:21.466 --> 19:23.300
LET THAT BLEED INTO A DEFENSE

19:23.366 --> 19:25.800
FOR SOMETHING THAT IS TOTALLY

19:25.866 --> 19:26.066
UNTENABLE.

19:26.133 --> 19:28.333
THE SCIENTIFIC TERM IS, IT IS A

19:28.400 --> 19:29.766
SHIT SHOW OVER THERE AND I DON'T

19:29.833 --> 19:32.200
CARE IF YOU'RE SMART OR NOT.

19:32.266 --> 19:34.400
THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE AS A

19:34.466 --> 19:35.733
NATION CANNOT SOLVE.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.966
NOW YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE, TWO

19:38.033 --> 19:38.600
SEPARATE CAMPS.

19:38.666 --> 19:39.966
IF YOU HAVE ONE WHO SAY LET'S

19:40.033 --> 19:41.300
GET OUT, A LITTLE SLIVER OF THAT

19:41.366 --> 19:42.633
WHO USED TO SUPPORT IT WHEN

19:42.700 --> 19:44.100
TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT AND NOW THEY

19:44.166 --> 19:45.933
OPPOSE IT, THEY ARE FRAUDS.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.300
BUT THERE'S A THIRD GROUP OF

19:48.366 --> 19:50.100
FOLKS WHO SAY WE SHOULD HAVE

19:50.166 --> 19:51.733
STAYED THERE FOREVER LIKE JAPAN

19:51.800 --> 19:53.266
AND KOREA, RIGHT?

19:53.333 --> 19:53.566
AND GERMANY?

19:53.633 --> 19:56.300
THAT'S ABSURD.

19:56.366 --> 19:57.600
THERE'S NOTHING WE COULD HAVE

19:57.666 --> 19:59.566
DONE TO HAVE FIXED IT OVER

19:59.633 --> 19:59.766
THERE.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.866
THE BETTER ANALOGY IS VIETNAM.

20:01.933 --> 20:03.000
IS THERE ANYONE WHO SENSIBLY

20:03.066 --> 20:08.500
BELIEVES WE SHOULD STILL BE IN

20:08.566 --> 20:08.733
VIETNAM?

20:08.800 --> 20:09.833
ABSENTLY NOT.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.566
THE MILITARY IS WORKING WONDERS,

20:12.633 --> 20:14.166
THE UNDERLYING INTELLIGENCE HERE

20:14.233 --> 20:15.566
WAS DEFINITELY WRONG, NO ONE

20:15.633 --> 20:17.700
SHOULD BE SAYING OTHERWISE, IT

20:17.766 --> 20:18.566
WAS DEFINITELY WRONG.

20:18.633 --> 20:20.500
NOW, THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE

20:20.566 --> 20:21.633
JOB DONE, I HAVE FULL

20:21.700 --> 20:22.100
CONFIDENCE.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.766
>> Bill: GET THE JOB DONE,

20:23.833 --> 20:25.733
GETTING AMERICANS OUT.

20:25.800 --> 20:26.500
[APPLAUSE]

20:26.566 --> 20:27.800
BUT THAT WASN'T THE JOB.

20:27.866 --> 20:30.066
THE JOB WAS FIRST TO GET

20:30.133 --> 20:31.700
BIN LADEN AND STOP THE TALIBAN

20:31.766 --> 20:35.033
AND SECOND TO REBUILD THE

20:35.100 --> 20:35.266
COUNTRY.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.733
>> THE SECOND WE THOUGHT THAT

20:37.800 --> 20:38.933
WAS WHAT WE WERE GOING TO

20:39.000 --> 20:41.100
ACCOMPLISH WE WERE DESTINED FOR

20:41.166 --> 20:42.133
FAILURE, THIS MOVIE WAS

20:42.200 --> 20:42.733
INEVITABLE.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.033
>> Bill: IT'S SO TRUE, I'VE

20:44.100 --> 20:45.266
HEARD PEOPLE SAY THAT AND I'VE

20:45.333 --> 20:46.333
HAD THE SAME THOUGHT -- WHY

20:46.400 --> 20:48.200
DIDN'T WE LEARN FROM THE EXACT

20:48.266 --> 20:49.733
SAME THING THAT HAPPENED IN

20:49.800 --> 20:50.066
VIETNAM?

20:50.133 --> 20:51.466
WE WENT INTO A COUNTRY THAT IS

20:51.533 --> 20:52.766
REALLY DIFFERENT FROM US,

20:52.833 --> 20:54.066
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND US, WE DON'T

20:54.133 --> 20:56.033
UNDERSTAND THEM, ARE NOT WANTED

20:56.100 --> 20:57.100
THERE, AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

20:57.166 --> 21:00.466
TO PUT A PUPPET IN CHARGE TO

21:00.533 --> 21:01.666
KEEP THE SHIT TO SHOE LEVEL AND

21:01.733 --> 21:03.366
THAT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE

21:03.433 --> 21:04.266
CORRUPT AND BREED CORRUPTION.

21:04.333 --> 21:05.666
HOW CAN WE DO THE EXACT SAME

21:05.733 --> 21:06.433
THING AGAIN?

21:06.500 --> 21:08.100
I WAS SAYING LAST WEEK AND I'M

21:08.166 --> 21:12.266
SAYING AGAIN, IT'S THE MONEY.

21:12.333 --> 21:13.933
IT'S THE $2 TRILLION.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.633
IT'S EASY TO GET MONEY LOST IN

21:15.700 --> 21:16.333
THIS COUNTRY WHEN IT'S COMING

21:16.400 --> 21:19.733
FROM GOVERNMENT BUT WHEN YOU ARE

21:19.800 --> 21:20.366
7,000 MILES AWAY, THE PENTAGON

21:20.433 --> 21:23.866
IS NOT AUDITED.

21:23.933 --> 21:26.933
THE PENTAGON, WHICH GETS 700

21:27.000 --> 21:28.433
PLUS BILLION A YEAR AND WE DON'T

21:28.500 --> 21:30.266
KNOW WHERE IT GOES -- WE KNOW A

21:30.333 --> 21:31.966
LITTLE WHERE IT GOES, THE

21:32.033 --> 21:34.100
PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN LEFT

21:34.166 --> 21:35.000
WITH 169 MILLION, THEY COULDN'T

21:35.066 --> 21:36.766
FIT IT IN FOUR CARS, IT WAS

21:36.833 --> 21:40.100
FALLING OFF THE HELICOPTER.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.366
THAT'S JUST ONE DAY IN

21:41.433 --> 21:43.333
AFGHANISTAN, THAT'S WHY.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.500
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY

21:45.566 --> 21:47.266
IS.

21:47.333 --> 21:47.800
DILLINGER SAID I ROB BANKS

21:47.866 --> 21:48.866
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY

21:48.933 --> 21:50.133
IS, WHAT ARE THE BANKS GET THE

21:50.200 --> 21:50.333
MONEY?

21:50.400 --> 21:52.300
FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

21:52.366 --> 21:54.166
>> I'M NOT GOING TO DISAGREE

21:54.233 --> 21:55.700
EXCEPT THAT A LOT OF THAT MONEY

21:55.766 --> 21:57.866
GOES TO THE TROOPS AS YOU KNOW,

21:57.933 --> 21:59.466
IT PAYS FOR THEIR PAY, THEIR

21:59.533 --> 22:00.466
PENSIONS AND THEIR MEDICAL

22:00.533 --> 22:01.133
TREATMENT AND WE ARE GOING TO BE

22:01.200 --> 22:04.300
PAYING A LOT OF MONEY ON MEDICAL

22:04.366 --> 22:07.466
BILLS AND WE ARE STILL PAYING,

22:07.533 --> 22:09.433
RIGHT NOW FOR THE VIETNAM

22:09.500 --> 22:09.733
GENERATION.

22:09.800 --> 22:10.633
>> Bill: IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A

22:10.700 --> 22:13.033
WAR WE WOULDN'T NEED THAT MANY

22:13.100 --> 22:13.666
TROOPS.

22:13.733 --> 22:18.133
[APPLAUSE]

22:18.200 --> 22:20.300
>> REPORTED $90 BILLION INTO A

22:20.366 --> 22:21.733
MILITARY THAT CRUMBLED IN 11

22:21.800 --> 22:24.366
DAYS, IF THAT'S NOT WASTEFUL, I

22:24.433 --> 22:26.300
DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

22:26.366 --> 22:27.166
THERE'S ANOTHER POINT HERE WHICH

22:27.233 --> 22:28.933
IS SHEER UNADULTERATED

22:29.000 --> 22:29.200
ARROGANCE.

22:29.266 --> 22:30.900
WHAT IS ALARMING IS THE VERY

22:30.966 --> 22:33.500
SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING "WE

22:33.566 --> 22:34.300
CAN GO TO AFGHANISTAN FOR

22:34.366 --> 22:35.466
MULTIPLE GENERATIONS AND

22:35.533 --> 22:37.433
TRANSFORM IT INTO DENMARK."

22:37.500 --> 22:38.833
IT'S THOSE SAME PEOPLE WHO BACK

22:38.900 --> 22:40.766
HERE AT HOME ARE SAYING NO TO

22:40.833 --> 22:42.466
UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE, NOTE A

22:42.533 --> 22:44.233
PAID FAMILY LEAVE, NOTATE

22:44.300 --> 22:45.700
UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL, NO TO US

22:45.766 --> 22:50.333
SPENDING ANYTHING TO HELP ANYON

22:50.400 --> 22:50.566
ANYONE.

22:50.633 --> 22:51.600
IT IS A SHOCKING HYPOCRISY.

22:51.666 --> 22:51.866
[APPLAUSE]

22:51.933 --> 22:55.966
>> Bill: TO THAT POINT,

22:56.033 --> 22:57.700
AFGHANISTAN IN A WAY IS LIKE THE

22:57.766 --> 22:58.500
ONLY BIPARTISAN THING WE'VE DONE

22:58.566 --> 23:00.866
IN A VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE AS I

23:00.933 --> 23:01.933
WAS SAYING IN THE MONOLOGUE, FOR

23:02.000 --> 23:02.466
YEARS DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN

23:02.533 --> 23:05.266
WANTING TO GET OUT, THAT HAS

23:05.333 --> 23:06.866
BEEN A LIBERAL POSITION AND THEN

23:06.933 --> 23:08.533
TRUMP GETS IN, HE LITERALLY

23:08.600 --> 23:10.700
MAKES THE DEAL, SETS THE

23:10.766 --> 23:11.833
DEADLINE, IF I DIDN'T KNOW WHO

23:11.900 --> 23:15.500
WAS PRESENT BEFORE BIDEN JUST

23:15.566 --> 23:16.700
FLEW DOWN FROM MARS, I THOUGHT

23:16.766 --> 23:19.200
IT WOULD BE SOMEONE FROM THE

23:19.266 --> 23:20.633
SAME PARTY BECAUSE HE CONTINUED

23:20.700 --> 23:21.500
THE POLICY.

23:21.566 --> 23:22.200
THE ONE THE PRESIDENT SAID A

23:22.266 --> 23:24.633
YEAR AGO, WE WILL GET OUT IN

23:24.700 --> 23:25.233
MAY, THE NEXT PRESIDENT, I'VE

23:25.300 --> 23:31.400
GOT THE BATON, CLOSE TO MAY --

23:31.466 --> 23:32.300
NO.

23:32.366 --> 23:34.333
TRUMPETED IT THIS WEEK, BIDEN

23:34.400 --> 23:37.433
SHOULD RESIGN IN DISGRACE.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.500
RICK SCOTT WANTS TO INVOKE THE

23:40.566 --> 23:41.566
25TH AMENDMENT, THAT'S THE ONE

23:41.633 --> 23:43.300
IF YOU ARE -- WE GOT TO GET YOU

23:43.366 --> 23:47.433
OUT, HE DID WHAT TRUMP --

23:47.500 --> 23:48.833
LINDSEY GRAHAM, IF ONE AMERICAN

23:48.900 --> 23:53.100
IS LEFT BEHIND, BIDEN SHOULD BE

23:53.166 --> 23:53.366
IMPEACHED.

23:53.433 --> 23:57.366
THE WAY THEY TURN ON A DIME, IT

23:57.433 --> 23:58.233
SHOWS NO ISSUE MATTERS, IT'S

23:58.300 --> 24:00.466
JUST WHAT TEAM YOU'RE ON.

24:00.533 --> 24:04.666
[APPLAUSE]

24:04.733 --> 24:07.300
>> BY THE WAY WHEN DONALD TRUMP

24:07.366 --> 24:07.866
WANTED TO GET OUT OF

24:07.933 --> 24:08.966
AFGHANISTAN, THERE WERE SOME OF

24:09.033 --> 24:10.800
MY FORMER COLLEAGUES THAT

24:10.866 --> 24:12.800
OPPOSED IT BECAUSE HE WAS

24:12.866 --> 24:14.766
DONALD TRUMP AND POLITICS, A LOT

24:14.833 --> 24:16.233
OF THESE FOLKS ARE FULL OF IT.

24:16.300 --> 24:18.433
I PROMISE YOU IF DONALD TRUMP

24:18.500 --> 24:20.166
CAME OUT FOR SOCIALISM TOMORROW,

24:20.233 --> 24:21.000
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP WOULD BE

24:21.066 --> 24:25.100
CALLING EACH OTHER COMRADE.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.233
[LAUGHTER]

24:26.300 --> 24:26.733
IT'S THE NATURE OF THIS

24:26.800 --> 24:28.500
BUSINESS, THEY ARE FOR THE MOST

24:28.566 --> 24:29.833
PART ARE OFTEN FULL OF IT.

24:29.900 --> 24:32.566
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THERE

24:32.633 --> 24:33.466
WAS A BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS THAT

24:33.533 --> 24:35.166
THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN, OUR

24:35.233 --> 24:36.533
LONGEST WAR, HAD TO END AND

24:36.600 --> 24:37.900
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED, IT WAS

24:37.966 --> 24:41.000
NEVER GOING TO BE PRETTY.

24:41.066 --> 24:43.100
>> Bill: I BELIEVE IN THE

24:43.166 --> 24:44.500
FUTURE, BIDEN'S DECISION WILL

24:44.566 --> 24:45.766
LOOK GOOD AND BRAVE, IT WAS

24:45.833 --> 24:47.033
GOING TO HAPPEN, IT HAD TO

24:47.100 --> 24:48.866
HAPPEN AND HE WAS THE ONE WHO

24:48.933 --> 24:49.800
FUCKING PULLED THE BAND-AID OFF.

24:49.866 --> 24:52.366
>> 100%.

24:52.433 --> 24:54.866
[APPLAUSE]

24:54.933 --> 24:56.666
>> Bill: YOUR BOOK IS ABOUT

24:56.733 --> 24:57.166
THE SUPREME COURT.

24:57.233 --> 24:59.200
>> AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, HOW

24:59.266 --> 25:01.000
WE GOT HERE.

25:01.066 --> 25:02.500
>> Bill: SO I WANT TO ASK YOU

25:02.566 --> 25:03.833
ABOUT THE COURT, WE ARE TALKING

25:03.900 --> 25:04.666
ABOUT PARTISANSHIP AND THAT'S

25:04.733 --> 25:06.533
THE ONE PLACE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO

25:06.600 --> 25:07.433
NOT HAVE PARTISANSHIP, I DON'T

25:07.500 --> 25:08.466
THINK THAT'S TRUE ANYMORE.

25:08.533 --> 25:10.900
I THINK IT USED TO BE PRETTY

25:10.966 --> 25:11.533
TRUE.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.933
BUT STEPHEN BREYER, HE IS 1 OF 4

25:15.000 --> 25:19.500
LIBERALS LEFT -- THREE.

25:19.566 --> 25:21.000
>> 6-3.

25:21.066 --> 25:22.666
>> Bill: RIGHT.

25:22.733 --> 25:26.033
HE'S 83, TYPICALLY A JUSTICE IF

25:26.100 --> 25:27.666
THEY'RE GOING TO RETIRE THEY'RE

25:27.733 --> 25:28.866
GOING TO RETIRE AT THE END OF

25:28.933 --> 25:31.266
THE TERM IN JUNE OR JULY BUT HE

25:31.333 --> 25:31.833
DIDN'T.

25:31.900 --> 25:33.133
DIDN'T HE WATCH WHAT HAPPENED

25:33.200 --> 25:34.000
WITH RUTH BADER GINSBURG IS MY

25:34.066 --> 25:38.466
QUESTION TO YOU?

25:38.533 --> 25:39.900
WE'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE.

25:39.966 --> 25:41.466
HE IS ROLLING THE DICE.

25:41.533 --> 25:44.466
I HOPE HE LIVES TO 100 BUT SO

25:44.533 --> 25:46.100
DID GINSBURG, SHE THOUGHT SHE

25:46.166 --> 25:47.500
COULD WIN THAT BET AND SHE

25:47.566 --> 25:48.433
DIDN'T AND IT'S A STAIN ON HER

25:48.500 --> 25:50.500
LEGACY.

25:50.566 --> 25:52.866
>> AND HE SAW EVEN WORSE WHAT

25:52.933 --> 25:54.833
HAPPENED TO MERRICK GARLAND, THE

25:54.900 --> 25:57.500
FACT THAT HE'S IN BOTH CASES THE

25:57.566 --> 25:58.633
COMMON THREAD IS MITCH

25:58.700 --> 26:00.100

26:00.166 --> 26:01.100
YOU HAVE MITCH McCONNELL

26:01.166 --> 26:02.700
ESPECIALLY IF REPUBLICANS TAKE

26:02.766 --> 26:04.233
BACK THE SENATE NEXT YEAR AND

26:04.300 --> 26:05.866
HE'S THE MAJORITY LEADER, EVEN

26:05.933 --> 26:06.966
AS MINORITY LEADER HE WOULD TRY

26:07.033 --> 26:11.366
HARD TO PREVENT BIDEN FROM

26:11.433 --> 26:13.900
FILLING A VACANCY.

26:13.966 --> 26:15.333
THIS IS A MAN AFTER

26:15.400 --> 26:18.266
ANTONIN SCALIA DIED IN FEBRUARY

26:18.333 --> 26:19.466
OF 2016 AND MERRICK GARLAND WAS

26:19.533 --> 26:23.300
NOMINATED IN MARCH OF 2016, HE

26:23.366 --> 26:27.100
SAID "LET THE PEOPLE SPEAK."

26:27.166 --> 26:27.733
HE PREVENTED A VOTE ALL THE WAY

26:27.800 --> 26:29.933
THROUGH THE ELECTION SO THAT WE

26:30.000 --> 26:36.166
NOW HAVE NEIL GORSUCH.

26:36.233 --> 26:39.700
STEPHEN BREYER, THIS IS A MAN

26:39.766 --> 26:42.133
WHO USED TO BE A STAFFER ON THE

26:42.200 --> 26:43.533
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, I

26:43.600 --> 26:44.833
CAN'T TELL YOU HOW ANGRY

26:44.900 --> 26:45.900
PRIVATELY DEMOCRATS ARE THAT HE

26:45.966 --> 26:48.866
DID NOT ANNOUNCE HIS RETIREMENT.

26:48.933 --> 26:52.200
>> Bill: HE MUST KNOW THAT,

26:52.266 --> 26:54.133
OBAMA HAD THAT LUNCH GINSBERG

26:54.200 --> 26:58.066
AND THAT WAS WHEN SHE WAS

26:58.133 --> 26:59.766
YOUNGER THAN HE IS NOW, THAT WAS

26:59.833 --> 27:01.266
2009 AND IT WAS HE DIDN'T SAY IT

27:01.333 --> 27:03.600
DIRECTLY BUT IT WAS LIKE "BOY,

27:18.166 --> 27:19.866
>> HE MUST BE HAVING A GOOD

27:19.933 --> 27:20.600
TIME, I HOPE HE RETIRES, DON'T

27:20.666 --> 27:22.933
GET ME WRONG BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

27:23.000 --> 27:25.166
ACKNOWLEDGE THE ABSURDITY OF ALL

34:03.566 --> 34:07.833
STEPHEN BREYER CROAKS.

34:07.900 --> 34:13.100
THEY GET TO PICK THE SUPREME

34:13.166 --> 34:13.433
COURT JUSTICE.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.633
>> THIS IS AN INSANE SYSTEM, I'M

34:15.700 --> 34:18.333
PROUD THAT I'M A NEW YORKER.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.833
THIS IS CRAZY.

34:20.900 --> 34:23.266
YOU ALL, JUST GO VOTE BECAUSE

34:23.333 --> 34:24.466
THIS IS OUT OF THIS WORLD.

34:24.533 --> 34:26.000
I THINK YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE

34:26.066 --> 34:28.466
HEAD, THERE IS A DEEPER POINT

34:28.533 --> 34:31.300
HERE AND WE COULD TIE THIS TO

34:31.366 --> 34:32.433
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH VACCINES.

34:32.500 --> 34:33.033
PEOPLE DON'T THINK ANYTHING OF

34:33.100 --> 34:35.333
THEIR GOVERNMENT ANYMORE, THEY

34:35.400 --> 34:36.633
DON'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT AND

34:36.700 --> 34:37.833
THEY JUST WANT TO KICK FOLKS OUT

34:37.900 --> 34:39.066
AND THEY COULD DO IT BETTER,

34:39.133 --> 34:41.233
THEY DON'T TRUST A THING THEY

34:41.300 --> 34:42.433
WOULD SAY AND IF WE DON'T TAKE A

34:42.500 --> 34:44.366
STEP BACK AS A NATION AND

34:44.433 --> 34:46.166
ACTUALLY TRY TO INVEST IN

34:46.233 --> 34:47.300
TRUSTED BUILDING IN A VERY REAL

34:47.366 --> 34:51.600
WAY MY MAY I ADD IT MEANS BEING

34:51.666 --> 34:52.233
BIPARTISAN.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.000
THE OTHER SIDE IS SAYING IT'S

34:54.066 --> 34:56.066
NOT EVIL, ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET

34:56.133 --> 34:57.033
SOMETHING DONE WHILE BEING TRUE

34:57.100 --> 34:58.700
TO YOUR VALUES, WE CAN'T BECOME

34:58.766 --> 34:59.133
THAT AGAIN.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.100
WE ARE GOING TO BE IN THIS

35:01.166 --> 35:03.633
CONSTANT CYCLE AND IT IS

35:03.700 --> 35:09.666
DANGEROUS.

35:09.733 --> 35:09.933
[APPLAUSE]

35:10.000 --> 35:11.833
>> CAN YOU GET TO THAT POINT

35:11.900 --> 35:14.066
WHERE WE HAVE NOW ARE SEPARATE

35:14.133 --> 35:14.833
INFORMATION ECOSYSTEMS, HOW DO

35:14.900 --> 35:18.400
YOU GET TO A PLACE OF TRUST WHEN

35:18.466 --> 35:20.333
HALF THE PEOPLE -- LET'S JUST

35:20.400 --> 35:22.200
TAKE IT BECAUSE WE HAVE A

35:22.266 --> 35:23.400
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, THEY ARE

35:23.466 --> 35:24.200
HEARING SOMETHING FROM BIDEN,

35:24.266 --> 35:25.800
HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO TRUST

35:25.866 --> 35:28.733
HIM WHEN THEN THEY TUNE IN ON

35:28.800 --> 35:29.500
ONE AMERICA OR NEWSMAX OR

35:29.566 --> 35:29.866
FOX NEWS.

35:29.933 --> 35:31.300
>> Bill: I DON'T TRUST EITHER

35:31.366 --> 35:32.800
OF THEM, EITHER SIDE, YOU SOUND

35:32.866 --> 35:33.900
LIKE YOU TRUST ONE SIDE TO.

35:33.966 --> 35:36.033
>> I TRUST ONE MORE THAN THE

35:36.100 --> 35:36.233
OTHER.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.233
>> Bill: SLIGHTLY.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.900
>> AND A PROUD DEMOCRAT, BUT

35:40.966 --> 35:43.833
BEFORE THAT I'M A PROUD AMERICA

35:43.900 --> 35:44.100
AMERICAN.

35:44.166 --> 35:45.000
I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM

35:45.066 --> 35:46.666
NECESSARILY WITH PICKING A SIDE

35:46.733 --> 35:48.900
BUT ALSO NOT THINKING THAT WE

35:48.966 --> 35:49.700
ARE ENEMIES HERE.

35:49.766 --> 35:50.266
>> Bill: YOU MENTIONED COVID

35:50.333 --> 35:52.600
AND YOU WORKED -- WHAT DO YOU DO

35:52.666 --> 35:55.266
FOR THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT?

35:55.333 --> 35:56.266
>> I ADVISED THE SECRETARY OF

35:56.333 --> 35:59.000
DEFENSE ON COVID MATTERS.

35:59.066 --> 35:59.600
>> Bill: I NOTICED THE

35:59.666 --> 36:03.766
WHITE HOUSE, THIS WAS FROM CNN

36:03.833 --> 36:04.900
JULY 29TH, THE WHITE HOUSE IS

36:04.966 --> 36:08.033
FRUSTRATED WITH WHAT IT VIEWS AS

36:08.100 --> 36:09.933
ALARMIST AND IN SOME CASES FLAT

36:10.000 --> 36:10.966
OUT MISLEADING NEWS COVERAGE

36:11.033 --> 36:13.400
ABOUT THE DELTA VARIANT, THIS IS

36:13.466 --> 36:17.433
WHY DON'T TRUST EITHER SIDE.

36:17.500 --> 36:18.400
AND "THE NEW YORK TIMES" WROTE

36:18.466 --> 36:20.166
THE DELTA VARIANT MAY BE SPREAD

36:20.233 --> 36:22.566
BY VACCINATED PEOPLE AS EASILY

36:22.633 --> 36:24.133
AS THE UNVACCINATED AND THE

36:24.200 --> 36:25.600
WHITE HOUSE FIRED BACK

36:25.666 --> 36:26.500
"VACCINATED PEOPLE DO NOT

36:26.566 --> 36:28.433
TRANSMIT THE VIRUS AT THE SAME

36:28.500 --> 36:29.400
RATE AS AN UNVACCINATED AND IF

36:29.466 --> 36:31.033
YOU FAIL TO INCLUDE THAT

36:31.100 --> 36:36.733
CONTEXT, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG."

36:36.800 --> 36:37.266
SO OBVIOUSLY GOVERNMENT IS

36:37.333 --> 36:40.933
FRUSTRATED WITH MEDIA.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.100
I BROUGHT THIS FACT UP A FEW

36:43.166 --> 36:47.566
MONTHS AGO, DEMOCRATS, 41%

36:47.633 --> 36:49.100
THINK -- OR FOUGHT IN THE POLL,

36:49.166 --> 36:51.500
THIS WAS A FEW MONTHS AGO, SO

36:51.566 --> 36:54.333
THIS MAY HAVE CHANGED -- 41%

36:54.400 --> 36:55.266
THOUGHT THE COVID

36:55.333 --> 36:55.966
HOSPITALIZATION OF PEOPLE WHO

36:56.033 --> 36:58.433
GET COVID, HOW MANY GO TO THE

36:58.500 --> 36:59.533
HOSPITAL, 41% OF DEMOCRATS

36:59.600 --> 37:02.433
THOUGHT IT WAS OVER 50%, IT'S

37:02.500 --> 37:05.166
UNDER FIVE.

37:05.233 --> 37:06.800
>> LET'S FIRST TALK ABOUT ONE

37:06.866 --> 37:09.000
ELEMENT IN THE ROOM, THERE IS A

37:09.066 --> 37:10.333
CERTAIN COVID ELITISM THAT HAS

37:10.400 --> 37:11.700
EMERGED AMONGST THE FAR LEFT,

37:11.766 --> 37:12.300
YOU CAN IMAGINE SOME OF THESE

37:12.366 --> 37:16.666
FOLKS --

37:16.733 --> 37:17.533
>> Bill: COVID ELITISM.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.766
>> YOU CAN IMAGINE SOME OF THESE

37:18.833 --> 37:21.633
FOLKS WEARING A MASK IN THE

37:21.700 --> 37:21.866
BATHTUB.

37:21.933 --> 37:22.133
[LAUGHTER]

37:22.200 --> 37:24.233
WE CAN OPENLY SAY WEARING A MASK

37:24.300 --> 37:26.500
SUCKS, IT'S HORRIBLE BUT THIS IS

37:26.566 --> 37:27.633
A CRISIS OF HOSPITALIZATION AND

37:27.700 --> 37:28.900
HOSPITAL CAPACITY.

37:28.966 --> 37:31.100
WHEN WE GET INTO A PLACE WHERE

37:31.166 --> 37:33.633
99% OF ICU BEDS ARE TAKEN, YOU

37:33.700 --> 37:35.800
GOT TO WEAR A MASK AND WE SHOULD

37:35.866 --> 37:37.200
BE WEARING A MASK BEFORE THAT SO

37:37.266 --> 37:38.266
WE AREN'T GETTING TO THAT PLACE,

37:38.333 --> 37:41.800
ALL WITH THE INTENT, THE UNITED

37:41.866 --> 37:43.433
HOPE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WEAR

37:43.500 --> 37:46.166
THEM ANYMORE OR OUR KIDS SHOULD

37:46.233 --> 37:46.800
BE WEARING MASKS UNTIL THEY CAN

37:46.866 --> 37:49.600
GET VACCINATED IN SCHOOLS.

37:49.666 --> 37:52.366
IF NOT TO SAY WE SHOULD BE DOING

37:52.433 --> 37:55.166
THIS FOREVER, WE'RE NOT TALKING

37:55.233 --> 37:58.466
TALKING ABOUT THAT NEARLY ENOUG

37:58.533 --> 37:59.233
ENOUGH.

37:59.300 --> 38:00.566
FOLKS GOT TO GET VACCINATED GET

38:00.633 --> 38:01.033
VACCINATED.

38:01.100 --> 38:01.866
>> Bill: WE ARE ALSO NOT

38:01.933 --> 38:03.666
ADDRESSING THE ROOT PROBLEMS,

38:03.733 --> 38:04.800
TALKING ABOUT HOSPITALS --

38:04.866 --> 38:05.533
ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN'T LET THE

38:05.600 --> 38:06.966
HOSPITALS BE OVERRUN BUT THE

38:07.033 --> 38:08.166
REASON WHY HOSPITALS GET OVERRUN

38:08.233 --> 38:10.466
IS BECAUSE WE RUN THEM LIKE

38:10.533 --> 38:11.000
AIRLINES.

38:11.066 --> 38:12.633
>> 100%.

38:12.700 --> 38:13.533
>> Bill: THEY ARE FOR-PROFIT,

38:13.600 --> 38:18.766
JUST THE WAY AN AIRLINE --

38:18.833 --> 38:19.733
HOSPITALS DON'T WANT EMPTY BEDS

38:19.800 --> 38:21.833
SO THEY ARE ALWAYS AT ALMOST

38:21.900 --> 38:24.333
CAPACITY, THAT'S NO WAY TO RUN A

38:24.400 --> 38:26.033
HOSPITAL.

38:26.100 --> 38:26.466
[APPLAUSE]

38:26.533 --> 38:30.433
>> ABSOLUTELY, IT'S A FOR-PROFIT

38:30.500 --> 38:32.800
SYSTEM, YOU ARE SEEING A CRISIS

38:32.866 --> 38:33.166
OF OPTIMIZATION.

38:33.233 --> 38:35.866
FOR JUST A SMALL NUMBER OF CASES

38:35.933 --> 38:38.400
WILL TILT OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS

38:38.466 --> 38:39.266
INTO ABJECT CRISIS.

38:39.333 --> 38:40.866
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS NOT DO IT

38:40.933 --> 38:41.500
WE DID AFTER THE SPANISH FLU

38:41.566 --> 38:44.033
WHICH IS FORGET ABOUT IT.

38:44.100 --> 38:45.166
AFTER THIS, WE HAVE TO INVEST IN

38:45.233 --> 38:48.633
A COUNTRY -- WE'VE GOT MISSILES

38:48.700 --> 38:49.600
EVERYWHERE, OUR DEFENSE

38:49.666 --> 38:53.300
INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX IS ONE GIANT

38:53.366 --> 38:54.400
INSURANCE PACKAGE CAN SOMETHING

38:54.466 --> 38:55.366
WE CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE HAPPENING,

38:55.433 --> 38:56.866
WE N NEED TO PANDEMIC INSURANCE

38:56.933 --> 38:59.066
PACKAGE AFTER THIS AND THAT

38:59.133 --> 39:00.733
PACKAGE HAS GOT TO INCLUDE

39:00.800 --> 39:01.366
DRAMATICALLY RE-ENVISIONING OUR

39:01.433 --> 39:02.300
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

39:02.366 --> 39:07.700
[APPLAUSE]

39:07.766 --> 39:08.566
>> Bill: IT ALSO HAS TO

39:08.633 --> 39:11.700
INCLUDE ADDRESSING OBESITY.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.200
THE ULTIMATE THIRD RAIL, I KNOW,

39:13.266 --> 39:15.766
PEOPLE HATE IT WHEN YOU BRING IT

39:15.833 --> 39:18.833
UP BUT IT WAS IN THE PAPER THIS

39:18.900 --> 39:19.833
WEEK.

39:19.900 --> 39:23.000
40% OF COVID DEATHS, PEOPLE HAD

39:23.066 --> 39:26.033
DIABETES.

39:26.100 --> 39:26.933
NAME ANY OTHER AILMENT SOMEONE

39:27.000 --> 39:27.933
WOULD HAVE IT YOU WOULD SAY OH,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.766
MY GOD, THAT IS HUGE.

39:30.833 --> 39:31.666
78% OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED

39:31.733 --> 39:38.900
OR WENT TO THE HOSPITAL, OBESE.

39:38.966 --> 39:40.333
88% OF DEATHS IN THE WORLD WERE

39:40.400 --> 39:42.533
FROM COUNTRIES WITH HIGH OBESITY

39:42.600 --> 39:45.000
RATES.

39:45.066 --> 39:46.066
HOW LONG CAN WE IGNORE WHAT IS

39:46.133 --> 39:48.200
AT THE CORE OF THE PROBLEM,

39:48.266 --> 39:49.800
SOMETHING THAT WAS KILLING US

39:49.866 --> 39:52.966
SLOWLY BEFORE COVID AND WITH

39:53.033 --> 39:54.366
COVID, YOUR BODY CANNOT TAKE THE

39:54.433 --> 39:54.600
STRESS.

39:54.666 --> 39:57.433
IT'S NOT HEALTHY TO BEGIN WITH,

39:57.500 --> 39:59.200
THE LEAST LITTLE THING WILL TAKE

39:59.266 --> 40:01.000
YOU DOWN AND WE STILL DO NOT

40:01.066 --> 40:04.166
HAVE ANY MESSAGING FROM THE

40:04.233 --> 40:06.266
WHITE HOUSE, FROM DR. FAUCI,

40:06.333 --> 40:07.066
FROM ANYBODY.

40:07.133 --> 40:09.200
THEY WILL NOT MENTION IT, WHY?

40:09.266 --> 40:11.266
THEY DON'T WANT TO OFFEND

40:11.333 --> 40:13.800
PEPSI-COLA?

40:13.866 --> 40:15.000
AND McDONALD'S AND ALL THE

40:15.066 --> 40:15.766
SHIT FOOD AND STUFF THAT PEOPLE

40:15.833 --> 40:18.600
PUT IN THEIR BODY?

40:18.666 --> 40:20.666
SHOULDN'T THEY TAKE SOME

40:20.733 --> 40:21.966
RESPONSIBILITY?

40:22.033 --> 40:28.400
[APPLAUSE]

40:28.466 --> 40:30.166
>> I KNOW YOU'RE THE ONE ASKING

40:30.233 --> 40:30.966
THE QUESTIONS BUT WHAT WOULD YOU

40:31.033 --> 40:34.233
HAVE THE GOVERNMENT --

40:34.300 --> 40:37.200
>> Bill: MENTIONED THAT!

40:37.266 --> 40:39.833
>> GIVE TAX SUBSIDIES TO

40:39.900 --> 40:40.266
SUGAR --

40:40.333 --> 40:41.800
>> Bill: LET'S STOP THAT, I

40:41.866 --> 40:43.966
WOULD GET GOOD FOOD IN THE POOR

40:44.033 --> 40:46.266
NEIGHBORHOODS.

40:46.333 --> 40:46.600
[APPLAUSE]

40:46.666 --> 40:48.033
THERE'S A MILLION THINGS YOU

40:48.100 --> 40:50.100
COULD DO IF YOU EVEN ADDRESSED

40:50.166 --> 40:51.633
IT, THEY DON'T EVEN ADDRESS IT.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.866
>> THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T EVEN GET

40:53.933 --> 40:54.933
MANDATES TO WEAR A MASK LET

40:55.000 --> 40:58.500
ALONE TAKE A VACCINE.

40:58.566 --> 41:04.800
>> Bill: YES, DON'T GET FAT.

41:04.866 --> 41:07.000
>> YOU THINK NONCOMPLIANCE WITH

41:07.066 --> 41:08.433
MASKS IS BIG?

41:08.500 --> 41:09.733
WAIT UNTIL YOU START TELLING

41:09.800 --> 41:10.033
PEOPLE --

41:10.100 --> 41:11.066
>> Bill: YOU WOULDN'T WORRY SO

41:11.133 --> 41:13.133
MUCH ABOUT A MASK IF YOU

41:13.200 --> 41:15.466
WEREN'T -- I JUST READ THE

41:15.533 --> 41:15.800
STATISTICS.

41:15.866 --> 41:18.066
4 OUT OF 5 PEOPLE WHO WIND UP

41:18.133 --> 41:21.600
DEAD, THIS IS THE REASON.

41:21.666 --> 41:24.666
>> IT'S --

41:24.733 --> 41:25.200
>> Bill: IS ABOUT LIFE AND

41:25.266 --> 41:26.066
DEATH?

41:26.133 --> 41:29.766
>> I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS A

41:29.833 --> 41:30.700
BELIEVER IN BODY SHAMING.

41:30.766 --> 41:32.400
>> WE'RE NOT CHAINING.

41:32.466 --> 41:34.366
>> OBESITY IS NO DOUBT A PUBLIC

41:34.433 --> 41:36.066
HEALTH CRISIS AND WE HAVE NOT

41:36.133 --> 41:36.633
FORGOTTEN THAT FIRST LADY

41:36.700 --> 41:38.833
MICHELLE OBAMA MADE THIS A HUGE

41:38.900 --> 41:39.700
PRIORITY WITH THE LEFT MOVE

41:39.766 --> 41:42.433
CAMPAIGN SPIRIT >> Bill: AND

41:42.500 --> 41:45.100
THEY HATED HER FOR IT.

41:45.166 --> 41:46.866
>> I THINK WE CAN DEFTLY INVEST

41:46.933 --> 41:50.866
IN PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS,

41:50.933 --> 41:53.633
THERE SHOULD BE NO SHAME IN

41:53.700 --> 41:54.900
THAT, IT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH

41:54.966 --> 41:57.233
CRISIS BUT ON THE SAME HAND --

41:57.300 --> 42:00.600
>> Bill: NOT TRIED, IT SEEMS

42:00.666 --> 42:03.433
LIKE WE GLORIFY GLUTTONY NOW,

42:03.500 --> 42:03.733
YOU KNOW?

42:03.800 --> 42:08.233
FIT SHAMING IS MUCH MORE COMMON.

42:08.300 --> 42:09.766
"YOU SHOULD EAT SOMETHING."

42:09.833 --> 42:13.133
NO, YOU SHOULD NOT EAT SOMETHIN

42:13.200 --> 42:13.400
SOMETHING.

42:13.466 --> 42:16.033
[APPLAUSE]

42:16.100 --> 42:17.200
LIKE NOW THEY WANT US TO DO

42:17.266 --> 42:19.666
THESE BOOSTERS, WE WERE TALKING

42:19.733 --> 42:21.400
ABOUT, I DON'T WANT A BOOSTER.

42:21.466 --> 42:22.600
I NEVER WANTED THE VACCINE, I

42:22.666 --> 42:25.666
TOOK ONE FOR THE TEAM.

42:25.733 --> 42:28.400
BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW WHO DOESN'T

42:28.466 --> 42:29.833
GET A LOT OF VACCINES?

42:29.900 --> 42:31.666
MILLENNIALS, I KNOW A LOT OF

42:31.733 --> 42:32.466
MILLENNIALS, ESPECIALLY 20s,

42:32.533 --> 42:33.433
THEY DON'T WANT TO COME THEY

42:33.500 --> 42:34.533
DON'T THINK THEY NEEDED, THEY'RE

42:34.600 --> 42:35.566
PROBABLY RIGHT BUT I TELL THEM,

42:35.633 --> 42:37.133
I DIDN'T WANT IT EITHER, I TOOK

42:37.200 --> 42:41.366
ONE FOR THE TEAM.

42:41.433 --> 42:42.133
[APPLAUSE]

42:42.200 --> 42:42.900
EVERY EIGHT MONTHS YOU'RE GOING

42:42.966 --> 42:44.433
TO PUT THIS SHIT IN ME?

42:44.500 --> 42:45.866
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT, MAYBE I

42:45.933 --> 42:49.133
DON'T NEED ONE, I DON'T WANT A

42:49.200 --> 42:49.933
ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL.

42:50.033 --> 42:50.600
MY BODY MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM

42:50.666 --> 42:53.433
YOUR BODY.

42:53.500 --> 42:57.266
>> YOU LOST ME, THAT'S CRAZY.

42:57.333 --> 42:59.000
>> Bill: MY BODY ISN'T

42:59.066 --> 42:59.266
DIFFERENT?

42:59.333 --> 43:01.000
I JUST READ THE STATISTICS ABOUT

43:01.066 --> 43:02.100
WHO DIES FROM THIS.

43:02.166 --> 43:03.100
>> YOU'RE TRYING TO BE CUTE AND

43:03.166 --> 43:05.200
ROLLING THE DICE.

43:05.266 --> 43:07.566
I'M IN YOUR HOUSE, I DO WANT TO

43:07.633 --> 43:10.366
STEP OVER THE LINE BUT

43:10.433 --> 43:11.333
GENUINELY, PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE ON

43:11.400 --> 43:13.733
THE LINE.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.166
JUST AS SIGNIFICANTLY, OUR VERY

43:15.233 --> 43:16.666
WAY OF LIFE IS ON THE LINE HERE,

43:16.733 --> 43:19.200
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE

43:19.266 --> 43:22.833
GET VACCINATED, IT'S VERY

43:22.900 --> 43:23.166
IMPORTANT --

43:23.233 --> 43:25.066
>> Bill: I SAID I TOOK ONE FOR

43:25.133 --> 43:25.466
THE TEAM.

43:25.533 --> 43:26.300
I'M SAYING GET VACCINATED TO.

43:26.366 --> 43:29.266
>> IF THERE IS A NEED FOR

43:29.333 --> 43:30.833
BOOSTERS PARTICULARLY AS THE

43:30.900 --> 43:32.266
EVIDENCE IS SHOWING AMONGST

43:32.333 --> 43:33.266
THOSE WHO HAVE UNDERLYING

43:33.333 --> 43:36.866
CONDITIONS, AMONGST THE ELDERLY,

43:36.933 --> 43:38.066
IT'S IMPORTANT THEY TAKE THEM

43:38.133 --> 43:39.700
AND IMPORTANT THEY TRUST THOSE

43:39.766 --> 43:41.633
WHO WERE URGING THEM TO DO IT.

43:41.700 --> 43:43.166
>> Bill: YOU JUST SAID

43:43.233 --> 43:43.700
UNDERLYING CONDITIONS AND

43:43.766 --> 43:45.466
ELDERLY, I DON'T COUNT MYSELF

43:45.533 --> 43:48.633
EITHER, IS MY BODY DIFFERENT?

43:48.700 --> 43:49.500
CAN I HAVE SOME MEDICAL

43:49.566 --> 43:52.000
AUTONOMY?

43:52.066 --> 43:54.933
>> NO ONE IS MANDATING IT FOR

43:55.000 --> 43:56.666
YOU IN YOUR PARTICULAR POSITION,

43:56.733 --> 43:59.633
ALTHOUGH THEY MIGHT.

43:59.700 --> 44:01.266
I DO THINK IT'S VERY DANGEROUS

44:01.333 --> 44:02.466
TO ENTER INTO A CONVERSATION

44:02.533 --> 44:04.633
ABOUT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY

44:04.700 --> 44:07.233
WHEN THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS

44:07.300 --> 44:08.800
THIS IS A MATTER OF COLLECTIVE

44:08.866 --> 44:09.466
RESPONSIBILITY.

44:09.533 --> 44:11.366
IF LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE DO NOT

44:11.433 --> 44:13.066
GET VACCINATED, THEY GO TO

44:13.133 --> 44:15.000
HOSPITAL AND OUR HOSPITALS GET

44:15.066 --> 44:15.433
OVERRUN.

44:15.500 --> 44:17.200
YOU CAN'T GET A MAMMOGRAM,

44:17.266 --> 44:18.933
BIOPSY, SO MANY OTHER THINGS,

44:19.000 --> 44:19.666
LITERALLY SOCIETY AS WE KNOW IT

44:19.733 --> 44:21.066
CANNOT FUNCTION.

44:21.133 --> 44:24.933
THIS IS IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE

44:25.000 --> 44:26.033
ARE URGED TO GET VACCINATED IS

44:26.100 --> 44:27.233
IMPORTANT THEY DO GET

44:27.300 --> 44:29.733
VACCINATED.

44:29.800 --> 44:33.433
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

44:33.500 --> 44:35.600
>> Bill: THAT'S WHY I SAID

44:35.666 --> 44:36.100
"THE TEAM."

44:36.166 --> 44:38.033
>> WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE YOU.

44:38.100 --> 44:38.633
>> Bill: BECAUSE I DID IT FOR

44:38.700 --> 44:39.866
THE TEAM.

44:39.933 --> 44:41.733
[APPLAUSE]

44:41.800 --> 44:46.200
AND THEN I GOT IT!

44:46.266 --> 44:47.200
>> WHEN YOU WORKED IN THE

44:47.266 --> 44:48.100
PENTAGON FOR THOSE MONTHS, WAS

44:48.166 --> 44:50.966
PART OF YOUR JOB GETTING THE

44:51.033 --> 44:53.366
MILITARY MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY

44:53.433 --> 44:54.266
TO GET VACCINATED?

44:54.333 --> 44:57.433
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE MILITARY

44:57.500 --> 44:57.866
RIGHT NOW --

44:57.933 --> 44:58.966
>> A LOT OF RESISTANCE.

44:59.033 --> 45:00.600
>> IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF THAT,

45:00.666 --> 45:02.300
THAT'S FALSE, OVER 80% OF THE

45:02.366 --> 45:05.466
MILITARY UNDER THE AGE OF 35,

45:05.533 --> 45:07.233
OVER 75% OF THE ACTIVE DUTY

45:07.300 --> 45:08.133
FORCE, 1.3 MILLION INDIVIDUALS,

45:08.200 --> 45:10.833
THEY GOT AT LEAST THEIR FIRST

45:10.900 --> 45:11.366
SHOT.

45:11.433 --> 45:13.666
THEY ARE SETTING A GREAT EXAMPLE

45:13.733 --> 45:14.300
FOR HOW WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS.

45:14.366 --> 45:19.100
>> WISE INTO 100%?

45:19.166 --> 45:19.666
>> I DON'T THINK WE'RE EVER

45:19.733 --> 45:23.800
GOING TO GET 100%.

45:23.866 --> 45:25.066
>> 95?

45:25.133 --> 45:27.300
>> THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS

45:27.366 --> 45:27.800
THE NATION HAD WHAT THE

45:27.866 --> 45:28.933
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS

45:29.000 --> 45:31.533
VACCINATION RIGHT NOW, WE WOULD

45:31.600 --> 45:34.500
BE WELL OVER 85, AND POST A 90%.

45:34.566 --> 45:35.466
>> Bill: JUST A BUTTON THIS

45:35.533 --> 45:36.466
UP, WE TALKED ABOUT THE MILITARY

45:36.533 --> 45:38.766
BEFORE WE HAD A VACCINE, IT WENT

45:38.833 --> 45:43.633
THROUGH A WHOLE SHIP, THE

45:43.700 --> 45:44.333
USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT, 4,000

45:44.400 --> 45:45.033
SAILORS, I DON'T THINK THEY ALL

45:45.100 --> 45:46.566
GOT IT BUT ABOUT HALF THE SHIP

45:46.633 --> 45:46.800
GOT IT.

45:46.866 --> 45:48.433
THERE WAS ONE DEATH.

45:48.500 --> 45:51.666
ONE IS TOO MANY, BUT TO THE

45:51.733 --> 45:52.833
POINT WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT,

45:52.900 --> 45:54.833
HEALTHY MILLENNIAL PEOPLE,

45:54.900 --> 45:56.766
DIDN'T DIE FROM IT.

45:56.833 --> 45:59.200
EVERYBODY SHOULD GET THE

45:59.266 --> 45:59.800
VACCINE, I'M NOT ARGUING WITH

45:59.866 --> 46:02.133
THAT BUT NUANCE IS IMPORTANT,

46:02.200 --> 46:04.600
EVEN WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A

46:04.666 --> 46:04.866
PANDEMIC.

46:04.933 --> 46:08.100

46:08.166 --> 46:08.966
TABOO TO AGREE WITH WHAT YOU

46:09.033 --> 46:11.133
JUST SAID AND THAT'S WRONG.

46:11.200 --> 46:11.933

ONLY HUMAN.

46:31.966 --> 46:34.566

APPLE, THE COMPANY THAT MADE IT

POSSIBLE FOR MEN TO SHOW WOMEN

48:27.633 --> 48:28.633
THEIR DICK FROM THOUSANDS OF

IT'S LIKE IF THE COMPANY THAT

49:26.600 --> 49:28.500
WHAT ABOUT THE 4TH AMENDMENT?

49:28.566 --> 49:29.833
THIS IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF

49:29.900 --> 49:31.866
UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND SEIZURE,

49:31.933 --> 49:33.733
WHICH CAN AND WILL BE ABUSED TO

49:33.800 --> 49:35.000
FIND EVIDENCE OF OTHER ILLEGAL

49:35.066 --> 49:36.866
STUFF ON OUR PHONES.

49:36.933 --> 49:42.100
IN MY CASE, DRUGS.

49:42.166 --> 49:42.366
[LAUGHTER]

49:42.433 --> 49:43.366
NOW AGAIN, I THINK CHILD

49:43.433 --> 49:44.100
PORNOGRAPHY IS BAD, AND I DON'T

49:44.166 --> 49:50.066
CARE WHO KNOWS IT.

49:52.200 --> 49:58.300
OUR OTHER RIGHTS DISAPPEAR.

50:01.766 --> 50:01.966
THANK YOU.

50:02.033 --> 50:02.566
AND I DON'T SEE A VERY STRONG

50:02.633 --> 50:03.333
FIGHT BREWING AGAINST THIS

50:03.400 --> 50:04.733
BLATANT CONSTITUTIONAL BREACH,

50:04.800 --> 50:06.600

50:06.666 --> 50:07.933
SO DEPENDENT ON SMART PHONES NOW

50:08.000 --> 50:09.100
THAT WE'LL LET THEM DO ANYTHING

50:09.166 --> 50:11.000
TO US.

50:11.066 --> 50:12.333
APPLE SHOULD ADMIT THAT THE

50:12.400 --> 50:13.833
PROBLEM WITH THEIR PHONES ISN'T

50:13.900 --> 50:15.233
JUST WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT STORE ON

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:28.633 --> 50:30.300

50:30.366 --> 50:31.566
STARTS IN ON HOW EVIL SMART

50:31.633 --> 50:32.766
PHONES ARE, THERE'S A PAT ANSWER

50:32.833 --> 50:34.466
COMING BACK ABOUT HOW PEOPLE

50:34.533 --> 50:35.800
HAVE ALWAYS FREAKED OUT ABOUT

50:35.866 --> 50:37.100
THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY CORRUPTING

50:37.166 --> 50:39.533
YOUNG MINDS.

50:39.600 --> 50:42.700
"C'MON THEY SAID IT ABOUT RADIO

50:42.766 --> 50:45.066
AND THE TELEPHONE AND TV", YEAH,

50:45.133 --> 50:47.133

50:47.200 --> 50:49.366
MIGHT BE RIGHT -- BUT IT'S NOT.

50:49.433 --> 50:50.333
NOT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOR

50:50.400 --> 50:52.266
MORE THAN TWO SECONDS.

50:52.333 --> 50:54.900
I DON'T REMEMBER LUGGING A TV

50:54.966 --> 50:56.100
UNDER MY COVERS SO I COULD WATCH

50:56.166 --> 50:58.933
HUCKLEBERRY HOUND UNTIL THE

50:59.000 --> 50:59.833

50:59.900 --> 51:05.100
WATCHING?"

51:05.166 --> 51:05.366

51:05.433 --> 51:06.066

51:06.133 --> 51:06.766

51:06.833 --> 51:07.566
BUT IT DIDN'T THROW OFF MY

51:07.633 --> 51:11.666
CIRCADIAN RHYTHM.

51:11.733 --> 51:11.933
[LAUGHTER]

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
I LIKED MCHALE'S NAVY, I WASN'T

51:13.066 --> 51:13.900
ADDICTED TO IT; I DIDN'T WATCH

51:13.966 --> 51:18.000
IT WHEN I DROVE.

51:18.066 --> 51:18.266
[LAUGHTER]

51:18.333 --> 51:20.166
RADIO TO TV WAS A DIFFERENCE IN

51:20.233 --> 51:22.333
DEGREE; SMARTPHONES ARE A

51:22.400 --> 51:24.800
DIFFERENCE IN KIND -- LESS LIKE

51:24.866 --> 51:25.966
TV OR RADIO AND MORE LIKE A

51:26.033 --> 51:28.066
PACEMAKER.

51:28.133 --> 51:28.900
SOMETHING YOU CAN'T LIVE

51:28.966 --> 51:31.200

51:31.266 --> 51:32.933

51:34.000 --> 51:36.366
THE WAY THE SMARTPHONE DOES.

51:36.433 --> 51:38.566
OF COURSE WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER

51:38.633 --> 51:45.466
I HAD A PRINCESS PHONE, BUT I

52:12.666 --> 52:14.166
MAN WHO WAS POSING AS ANOTHER

52:14.233 --> 52:18.700
TEENAGER BUT WAS REALLY 50.

52:18.766 --> 52:18.966
[LAUGHTER]

52:19.033 --> 52:19.866
A FORMER VP AT FACEBOOK SAID HE

SOCIETY WORKS."

52:29.533 --> 52:31.866
TV DIDN'T DO THAT.

52:31.933 --> 52:33.600
PSYCHOLOGY TODAY SAYS THE

52:33.666 --> 52:35.866
AVERAGE HIGH SCHOOL KID TODAY

52:35.933 --> 52:37.000
HAS THE SAME LEVEL OF ANXIETY AS

52:37.066 --> 52:38.533
THE AVERAGE PSYCHIATRIC PATIENT

52:38.600 --> 52:41.266
IN THE EARLY 1950S, AND THAT'S

52:41.333 --> 52:42.200

53:37.033 --> 53:37.800

MAYBE IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

ENOUGH?"

53:55.100 --> 53:55.300
[LAUGHTER]

54:22.200 --> 54:22.900
REDUCED FROM A QUEST FOR TRUE

54:22.966 --> 54:25.266
LOVE TO LOOKING AT A MENU.

"I THINK I'LL HAVE THE KELLY

54:30.866 --> 54:32.366

54:32.433 --> 54:34.600
ANGRIER, MORE VITRIOLIC, MORE

54:38.366 --> 54:39.266
TO SAY THOSE THINGS TO SOMEONE'S

54:39.333 --> 54:42.000

54:42.066 --> 54:43.166

54:43.233 --> 54:44.233

54:44.300 --> 54:45.166
HYPER AGGRESSIVE TO TOTAL

54:45.233 --> 54:46.800
STRANGERS.

54:46.866 --> 54:47.866
IT HAS TWO SETTINGS: "I'LL KILL

54:47.933 --> 54:49.333
YOU."

54:49.400 --> 54:58.600
OR "YOU'RE DEAD TO ME."

55:01.300 --> 55:02.733
WAS THE MESSAGE YOU WANTED TO

55:02.800 --> 55:04.200
SEND TO SOMEONE YOU'D EVEN

55:04.266 --> 55:05.800
BOTHER SENDING IT, BECAUSE EVEN

55:05.866 --> 55:07.066
TEXTING IS TOO CONFRONTATIONAL

55:07.133 --> 55:09.333
FOR MOST PEOPLE NOW.

55:09.400 --> 55:10.766
WE DON'T ENGAGE WITH OUR FRIENDS

55:10.833 --> 55:11.633
WHEN WE DISAGREE, WE JUST WALK

55:11.700 --> 55:12.900

55:16.566 --> 55:18.100

55:18.166 --> 55:19.500
GHOSTING -- IT'S THE ELECTRONIC

55:19.566 --> 55:20.366
EQUIVALENT OF GOING OUT FOR A

55:20.433 --> 55:21.266

EATING IN A RESTAURANT AND

THEY'RE ALL STARING DOWN AT

IF, INSTEAD OF A PHONE YOU

55:49.233 --> 55:52.466
BROUGHT A MAGAZINE TO THE TABLE
