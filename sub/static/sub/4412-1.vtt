WEBVTT

00:08.920 --> 00:10.604
Grand Canyon ain't nothin'.

00:11.640 --> 00:17.170
Being a grandfather, or a father, now that's
harder than being the Grand Canyon.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.771
It's just a hole, sitting there,
doing nothing.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.608
Okay, but are you even okay without
havin' a Grand Canyon?

00:25.080 --> 00:30.260
Or should we just kick some sand up all
over it, and fill it up like a cat box?

00:30.360 --> 00:31.361
Shit.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.860
All I'm sayin' is the Grand Canyon is

00:35.960 --> 00:38.780
where Joe was left that very day.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.780
Yo, Ebony, Ivory?
You talkin' about Joe Dirt?

00:41.880 --> 00:44.201
- Yeah.
- I know a little something about Joe Dirt.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.140
Stopped into an old radio station I worked
a few years back.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.050
Stayed for, it must have been a week.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.364
Wove some bat-shit crazy tale.

00:54.560 --> 00:58.360
So bat-shit, he should have hung upside
down from the ceiling when he was telling it.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.922
I remember a big kid, bigger heart.

01:02.160 --> 01:05.607
Sure, you know, I'm not saying the IQ
wasn't subterranean.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.202
I mean, that intellect was barely
skimming the treetops.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.686
Now, I ain't saying that I ain't
in "agree-ence" with you.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.500
But somewhere in there,
the speechifying you making,

01:17.600 --> 01:19.060
it just ain't sounded right.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.367
Hey, John C-minus Reilly.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.731
It's not "agree-ence",
it's "agreematude".

01:24.880 --> 01:27.690
And by the way, what's with the mouth
for God's sakes?

01:27.840 --> 01:31.561
The teeth look like a half-completed
Lego project.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.820
What are you gargling with, M-80s?

01:33.920 --> 01:37.500
Are those deciduous teeth? I'm waiting
for them to change color, fall out

01:37.600 --> 01:41.540
and float down to the Grand. Who's your
orthodontist, Moe Howard with

01:41.640 --> 01:43.060
a ball-peen hammer?

01:43.160 --> 01:47.290
I mean, for God's sakes, man. It looks like
Willie Stargell took a bat to your mouth.

01:49.880 --> 01:52.780
Now listen, JD has got himself in
another bind here.

01:52.880 --> 01:57.180
But, why not let the boy tell ya
his own tale, in his own way?

01:57.280 --> 01:59.009
Let's drop that needle, guys.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.848
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second.

02:08.240 --> 02:11.767
That's a sweet song, I get
the thematics, but this is Joe Dirt.

02:11.960 --> 02:16.363
We're gonna start this puppy off,
we gotta go old school. Try it again, guys.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074

03:02.680 --> 03:03.966
Hello.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.045
I'm Dirt. I'm Joe Dirt.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.729
Those look like pretty comfortable
shoes you got on there.

03:14.280 --> 03:18.444
My boots don't feel so good, but
they're, like, magical or something.

03:19.320 --> 03:22.220
Look, cracker, don't you be talking
no Forrest Gump

03:22.320 --> 03:24.926
crap to me, you little bitch waffle.

03:25.040 --> 03:29.060
Sittin' there talkin' all that honky-ass
whiney crap like,

03:29.160 --> 03:32.767
"Mama said life is like a box
of chocolates."

03:32.920 --> 03:34.220
Boy, sittin' next to you for even

03:34.320 --> 03:38.530
ten seconds makes me feel like I should take
a shower in a bath full of Clorox.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.245
Shit.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.325
Mullet head.

03:49.880 --> 03:54.220
If I said "hi" to you, you're not going to
call me, like, a dumb crap Forrest Gump

03:54.320 --> 03:55.651
or something, will you?

03:56.120 --> 03:59.920
Well, let's play it by ear.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.606
Are you waiting on the seven
cross-town bus?

04:02.720 --> 04:03.767
Fair enough.

04:03.960 --> 04:09.171
No, I'm just waitin' for the concert
to be over, over there. I tidy up after.

04:09.360 --> 04:14.287
- Tidy up?
- Dirty, yeah. I'm sort of, you know, a roadie.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.779
You travel with the bands, and you
pack up their equipment after concerts

04:18.880 --> 04:23.300
- and their amplifiers and stuff?
- Yeah, exactly. But, no, not per Se.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.246
I don't travel with them.
Mostly I mop up after they're done.

04:27.520 --> 04:33.402
Like, I clean up the poop and the barf
and things. And your occasional fart items.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.403
And peepee, you know, whatnot.

04:35.640 --> 04:40.300
So, you don't actually travel with them,
and such. Not a roadie.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.460
No, exactly. I don't know where
that started, yeah.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.780
- Now we're on the same page.
- Why aren't you in there,

04:46.880 --> 04:50.202
- watching them perform?
- Well,

04:51.120 --> 04:56.420
I ain't exactly allowed in the building
during the concerto, if you will.

04:56.520 --> 05:01.060
But, if there is a diarrhea emergency or
something, I get to go in and clean it up.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.401
And I can hear a little bit.
So there are some perks.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.044
I enjoy my job. 'Cause if people have
a hard week, and they wanna rock out

05:08.160 --> 05:12.580
at a concert, I like to help, you know,
picking up their garbage and bodily fluids,

05:12.680 --> 05:15.081
just so they can relax.
They can thank me later.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.801
They don't. But that's cool.

05:17.920 --> 05:23.211
It don't stop me from being All In, All
The Time. You know how it is, yeah.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.891
So much has been happening to me
that I don't even understand it all.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.131
It's all just happening
way above my pay grade.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.900
Above zero? Just kidding.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.765
- Sorry, that was rude.
- That's a good one. You got me.

05:37.920 --> 05:42.020
That's pretty much how it is. See,
my new story picks up after my first story,

05:42.120 --> 05:45.488
and yet it goes back
to the day I was born.

05:46.400 --> 05:51.122
Well, you've got me intrigued.
And I don't see the bus coming nearby, so

05:51.880 --> 05:53.325
start at the beginning.

05:54.280 --> 05:57.284
It starts where every good thing
in my life ever got started.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.610
Silvertown.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.084
Man, that's the greatest town ever.

06:47.040 --> 06:52.171
And today was the best day ever.
Man, I was marrying Brandy.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.004
Hey! Come here, get down!

07:14.200 --> 07:16.089
It was like I was dreamin'.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.687
Brandy knew me better
than I knew myself.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.209
Like, she knew that I didn't know what
seven times seven was.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.523
I mean, yeah,
now I know that it's 77, but still.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.045
She knew me.

07:28.240 --> 07:31.940
And just when I thought it couldn't
get any better, it did.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.041
Joe...

07:33.160 --> 07:34.889
We were gonna have a baby.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.003
Morning sickness came on fast.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.041
Get it out.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.447
But Brandy was a real trooper about it.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.567
And then the big day arrived.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.820
Joe, honey? How are you doing?

07:53.920 --> 07:56.740
Yeah, yeah, I'm doing good, baby.
I'm doing good.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.460
Please make her smart like Brandy.
Please make her smart like Brandy.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.564
- Don't make her dumb like me.
- Joe?

08:03.000 --> 08:03.980
What?

08:04.080 --> 08:06.820
I don't know what to do. Just tell me if
there's something I need to help you with.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.420
- Honey, honey, breathe. Okay?
- Yeah.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.780
- In and out. That's it.
- Oh, man.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.769
We're gonna see our baby real soon.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.331
I hope she looks like you.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.970
Shut up!

08:18.080 --> 08:21.820
I mean, shut up, because, no,
please, she has to look like you, baby.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.922
Don't waste a favor.
What if God listens? You can't...

08:24.040 --> 08:28.045
You are the most handsomest man
that I have ever seen.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.620
Baby, I think them drugs
put your eyeballs to sleep,

08:31.720 --> 08:33.643
because you don't know
what you're saying.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.929
All right, let's take a look.

08:36.760 --> 08:40.924
Centimeter dilation,
looks just about right.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.004
Hey, Doc, are you smoking?

08:43.520 --> 08:46.603
Was it the cigarette that
gave it away, Sherlock?

08:50.200 --> 08:53.124
- Doctor girl?
- Mister, may I call you Brandy?

08:53.280 --> 08:56.220
Because I feel like once I've seen your
muff, we should be on a first name basis.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.700
Okay, this exchange doesn't sound too
"doctorish" to me.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.610
How cool. Did you go to med school?

09:02.120 --> 09:03.406
No, I did not.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.540
So, you don't know how doctors talk.
I thought maybe you did

09:06.640 --> 09:10.611
the way you sounded all confident about our
exchange not sounding doctor-like.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.700
My Joe went to the school of hard knocks

09:12.800 --> 09:15.610
but graduated with honors.
Please treat him with respect.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.690
That's nice, Brandy, ya always say
the nicest stuff about me.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.643
Well, I can't help myself, baby.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.441
Well, well, our little girl is crowning.
You're about to meet your baby.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.689
- Hear that, baby?
- I love her so much already!

09:27.920 --> 09:30.491
Miss? Hold on a second.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.300
Sue, I think there's another baby
up in there.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.643
- Did I hear there's probably another baby?
- Hey, we're in a meeting.

09:35.840 --> 09:41.324
Hey, Doc, I just wanna... Whoa.
Jackpot! Give me some!

09:41.640 --> 09:43.722
- What?
- It's a medical term.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.300
It's a medical term,
it don't sound like one.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.767
Wow! Did you go to med school?

09:48.880 --> 09:53.169
- No, we went over this earlier.
- Hey, Doc, I do see another baby in there.

09:53.280 --> 09:55.009
Although I'm no baby expert.

09:55.160 --> 09:58.130
- You ain't no expert?
- I wanted to get in on this one as soon as

09:58.240 --> 10:01.801
I heard it was gonna be Brandy-Boo
up here in these here stirrups.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.962
- What's that?
- Get out of here, man.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.768
What are you doing? Don't talk that way.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.700
- Oh, shit.
- What now? What's the matter?

10:09.800 --> 10:11.580
- There's three up in there.
- Three what?

10:11.680 --> 10:13.330
Three babies, dumbass.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.180
- I told you. I told you.
- Well, I see them now.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.725
Excuse me.

10:19.880 --> 10:24.283
Today is the day when these tiny
little lives begin their journey

10:25.040 --> 10:28.567
that, God willing, will outlast
everybody in this room.

10:29.760 --> 10:34.322
Joe and I would appreciate it if you would
show the proper reverence.

10:36.160 --> 10:40.700
Baby, that's so good. She got the speeches
down. That's poetry right there.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.201
You're my little MLK, baby.

10:45.880 --> 10:50.090
This Brandy chick is pure gold.
Inside and out.

10:50.760 --> 10:54.560
A woman like that loving a man like him.
I must have misjudged this fool.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.089
What do you say we deliver these babies?

10:59.240 --> 11:03.370
Wow. Martin Scorsese couldn't compose
a better shot.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.562
What more could a guy ask for?

11:07.040 --> 11:08.166
That wasn't it.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.580
Hey, what did Brandy just say?
Let's deliver us some babies.

11:11.680 --> 11:12.920
You got it, Joe Dirt.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.766
Give us some room.
Three babies comin' up.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.860
- Push! Push!
- You got this. Come on. You can do it!

11:18.960 --> 11:19.961
Are they talking?

11:21.280 --> 11:24.124
Congratulations, you have triplets!

11:24.480 --> 11:25.500
What?

11:25.600 --> 11:30.401
Brandy, you hear that? We got us a little
NASCAR pit crew. I'm so happy.

11:33.680 --> 11:38.340
Joe, it's sweet that you wanna name them
Brandy Junior, Brandy Brandy,

11:38.440 --> 11:43.300
and Brandy 2.0 the Special Edition,
but they need real names.

11:43.400 --> 11:47.371
You're right. You're the brains of the outfit.
All right, how about this, I've been thinking

11:48.080 --> 11:52.100
- Def Lep, Skynyrd and Seger.
- Joe! Be serious.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.921
I know. The Def Lep one is wrong.
That's no good. All right, how about this?

11:56.280 --> 12:00.683
383 Magnum, 440 Magnum,
and 426, it's a Hemi.

12:00.840 --> 12:04.049
It's a Hemi. Everyone loves a Hemi.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.260
Joe, I am naming them.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.420
All right, you constructed them,
you did all the work.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.648
You made 'em perfect and amazing.
What do you got?

12:11.000 --> 12:14.686
Cheyenne, Abilene, and Dakota.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.891
So perfect. You're so good at this,
three for three.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.640
- Yeah?
- You did good.

12:21.480 --> 12:22.481
Look at 'em.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.324
So everything was good.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.365
Sure there were some bumps.

12:27.480 --> 12:31.724
Like this local guy, Jimmy Yauch.
Man, he was worse than Robby.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.771
What you doing over there?

12:34.640 --> 12:36.324
Makes the smoke minty fresh.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.967
What, are you a scientist now?

12:40.880 --> 12:44.420
No, I drive a truck for Kipper's tow yard.
I thought you knew that.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.522
And you suck what? I didn't hear that.

12:48.480 --> 12:53.327
First of all, no, and second, who's
feeding you all this false information?

12:53.680 --> 12:55.603
Well, that would be your mother, son.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.940
I think you better stop.
You better stop now.

13:00.040 --> 13:04.602
'Cause like Omar say,
"You come at the king, you best not miss."

13:05.360 --> 13:10.161
- But, I didn't come at you.
- Anyways, boys, I been working on a song.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.845
About the hottest shorty boo that ever
did walk the face of the Earth.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.601
And I'm telling you this right now.
Brandy, one day she will be mine.

13:18.720 --> 13:19.721
Now this I swear.

13:20.880 --> 13:21.881
Check this out.

13:23.640 --> 13:27.361
I'm a son of a gun
not a box of six-gun repeaters

13:29.040 --> 13:33.409
I'm a backdoor man
not just some Walmart greeter

13:34.440 --> 13:37.091
I'm rocking a double five-five wiener

13:38.760 --> 13:41.081
Looking for Brandy's love meter

13:49.840 --> 13:52.605
Damn it, I know I suck.
I ain't got no poetry.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.563
See, with a girl like Brandy,
you got to have some poetry in you.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.123
But it's a catch-22.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.729
Because a woman like that
puts the poetry in you.

14:03.760 --> 14:08.448
Damn it to 'Frisco. I hate poetry.
I can't stand poetry.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.651
Damn Joe Dirt. It ain't right!

14:12.000 --> 14:16.130
It ain't right. It should be me, man.
It should be me and not Joe Dirt.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.126
Sorry about that guitar thing, man.
It got out of hand.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.090
It is what it is.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.803
We all have our cross to bear.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.126
Mine is Joe piece of Dirt.

14:29.320 --> 14:32.847
Jimmy, that dude was trouble
waiting to happen.

14:34.120 --> 14:38.489
But my girls, man, look at them.
They was growing like weeds.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.121
Three beautiful flowers.

14:41.440 --> 14:45.923
Yeah, more flowers than weeds. Forget
weeds. They was growin' like flowers.

14:46.680 --> 14:51.288
But deep down inside, I was feeling like,
who was I to be happy, you know?

14:51.640 --> 14:54.883
'Cause I was always nervous,
feeling like it could all go away.

14:56.280 --> 15:00.330
Turns out I was right to be worried, because
soon it all started unraveling on me.

15:00.760 --> 15:06.085
I got this job as a logger, and one day,
it all started coming crashing down on me.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.020
It came down real bad.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.406
Eleven-footer.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.607
Yeah. Yeah.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.680
Luke, I am your logger.

15:32.480 --> 15:35.245
You can't hear it, but it was funny.
All right, here we go.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.011
It's sticking.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.081
That's lunch.

15:55.200 --> 15:58.204
I think I cut 66 logs so far, man.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.249
Probably get a good price down
at the mill.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.260
- Hey, Dirt?
- Yep.

16:03.360 --> 16:06.045
- You strong?
- You know it.

16:08.600 --> 16:09.601
Pick that up.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.087
Kinda walked into
that one, didn't I? Yeah.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.283
Hey, Dirt. You look like Elmer Fudd
in that hat.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.402
Shit, more like Elmer Fudgepacker.

16:23.240 --> 16:27.564
Yeah, that guy in the cartoons.
Yeah, I guess. Looking stupid, yeah.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.780
I seem to have forgotten my lunch,

16:30.880 --> 16:33.087
maybe you could give me the apple core
when you're done with it?

16:33.920 --> 16:35.490
Nah, you can't have that, boy.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.561
I do have something for ya. Here you go.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.925
Mind if I join ya? I got one for ya.
Come on, dirty Dirt. Come on.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.445
I got one. I got one for a face to
land on, myself.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.608
A little up close and person...

16:57.800 --> 17:01.122
Boy, that one has got sauerkraut.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.842
Hey, little logger boy.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.327
Sexy Joe. These boys giving you trouble?

17:09.240 --> 17:12.084
No, Missy, we're just funning around.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.929
Can you keep a secret?

17:14.560 --> 17:17.689
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Then keep this a secret.

17:26.079 --> 17:29.846
That secret had some secret sauce in it.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.925
How was hers the worst one?
Oh, man, Missy.

17:33.080 --> 17:36.289
I still got some meth gas left inside.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.731
Get this guy a paper towel.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.965
You're right, kraut.
Can you read farts, boy?

17:48.120 --> 17:50.009
Tell me what I had
for supper last night.

17:51.040 --> 17:54.328
All right, that's it, man.
22 times ain't funny no more.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.842
Is this where you wanna be when Jesus
comes back? Fartin' in Joe Dirt's face?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.685
I will take my chances.

18:05.920 --> 18:06.921
Daddy?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.644
Why are they farting on you?

18:12.680 --> 18:16.571
And right there, it started to dawn on them
that their dad,

18:17.120 --> 18:21.728
the dad they used to think was Superman,
wasn't no Superman.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.807
He was a loser. He was just Joe Dirt.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.940
Y'all leave him alone.

18:40.040 --> 18:44.364
Stop farting into his face, or there's more
whoop-ass where that came from.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.331
- Missy!
- What? I have a medical condition.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.851
Scram, girl!

18:49.560 --> 18:50.607
I can't catch a break.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.361
Honey, are you all right?

18:54.520 --> 18:56.820
Yeah, Brandy. I can take care of myself.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.780
I don't need you kicking
these guys' butts for me.

18:58.880 --> 19:02.726
I know you can take care of yourself, baby.
Of course you can.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.722
And that was it.
They saw right through me.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.365
I'm just the boy who was left at
the Grand Canyon.

19:18.600 --> 19:23.401
Like some empty Popsicle wrapper,
you know? Like cherry or lemon-lime.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.604
Orange is another flavor...

19:26.160 --> 19:28.447
You see now, I never invented
something great.

19:28.560 --> 19:32.087
I didn't do anything like that.
I didn't invent antigravity or

19:33.160 --> 19:37.290
Snausages, or them "Back off, Jack!"
Yosemite Sam mud flaps.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.765
Those are cool. I wish I did.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.540
I just thought, if I was rich or famous,
you know, then I could make 'em proud

19:43.640 --> 19:46.340
and then they'd love me for real.

19:46.440 --> 19:51.401
Joe, that's ridiculous! You love them,
they love you. Go tell them, it'll be fine.

19:51.880 --> 19:52.927
I can't.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.761
'Cause everything just went away,
like I knew it would.

19:56.880 --> 20:01.602
You know, one time, when I was growing up,
I was in one of my many foster homes

20:01.880 --> 20:03.450
and they had a guy come speak to us,

20:03.960 --> 20:06.281
and he was super smart,
he was wearing glasses and everything.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.811
He said something that stuck with me,
I'll never forget it.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.740
He said, "Revolutions never happen in
countries where things get so bad

20:13.840 --> 20:15.649
"that people can't take it anymore."

20:16.000 --> 20:19.641
No. "Revolutions happen when things
just get a little bit better."

20:20.640 --> 20:22.847
People get a taste of what
they've been missing.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.441
And I got that.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.487
I got my family, and now it's gone.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.085
- Gone, what happened?
- Well, this is the part of the story

20:32.840 --> 20:34.205
where it gets really weird.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.724
There was a storm coming.
Man, a big storm.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.441
A "mess up your hair really bad" storm.

20:43.320 --> 20:47.100
Get into the basement. Come on!
Cover your eyes!

20:47.200 --> 20:49.328
- It's all going to be okay!
- Cover your eyes!

20:49.440 --> 20:51.820
- Come on, girls.
- Basement. Go, babe.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.900
Come on, babies, hurry.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.140
- Daddy, I'm scared.
- It's just wind. I know, baby, it's just wind.

20:58.240 --> 21:02.020
Daddy, my princess tiara.
I left it in the trailer.

21:02.120 --> 21:06.364
- It's okay. It'll be there tomorrow, honey.
- But it was a birthday present from Daddy.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.580
- I'll go get it.
- No. Don't go.

21:14.680 --> 21:18.002
I'll get it. It's okay, baby.
I'm Superman. I'll be back.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.050
Daddy, be careful. We love you!

21:21.880 --> 21:23.484
Be careful, Joe.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.203
Come on. Hurry!

21:40.640 --> 21:42.642
Dang, that twister's getting close!

21:43.400 --> 21:45.084
Yeah, this one is for real.

21:45.480 --> 21:48.802
Please don't scratch my car!

21:51.440 --> 21:52.726
Hi, Daddy.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.043
Girls, what happened to the storm?

21:57.160 --> 22:02.371
What are you talking about, loser?
Go make us some cash like Kanye.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.244
Treat us like North.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.401
Cow?

22:44.520 --> 22:47.060
Sock him in the jaw. He's all yours.
He's all yours.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.561
Back him up, back him up.
Knock him down.

22:49.680 --> 22:53.924
I'm gonna whup you 'til you ain't nothin'
but loose bones and loose change...

22:58.480 --> 22:59.845
Oh, crap.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.171
You see that? Y'all see what happened?

23:12.440 --> 23:15.887
A trailer come out of the sky,
and lands on Lucky Louie.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.564
Lucky Louie's dead.
That could have been any one of us.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.243
What happened?

23:27.040 --> 23:31.045
You done killed the most vicious leader
to ever head up the Smokin' Jokers.

23:32.320 --> 23:35.847
You killed Lucky Louie,
with just one house.

23:36.600 --> 23:40.571
No, no, man. I didn't kill nobody.
I was spinning in the twister

23:41.160 --> 23:44.369
- and it was a bad storm, it threw me.
- What storm?

23:46.400 --> 23:49.847
It was black clouds, now it's all
tweet-tweet. I don't know what happened.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.682
You killed Lucky Louie, and now you're
our new leader.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.244
Long as you wear these,

23:57.120 --> 24:00.010
we go where you go,
and we ride where you ride.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.322
Oh, man, these are nice. The ruby's
a little fruity, but I'll take them.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.086
Name's Foggle.
What's your name, brother?

24:07.680 --> 24:11.162
Joe. Joe Dirt. Joe Dirtay.

24:11.360 --> 24:12.407
Which is it?

24:12.720 --> 24:15.405
- Joe Dirt.
- You all hear that?

24:15.920 --> 24:19.527
- All hail, Joe Dirt.
- All hail Joe Dirt.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.722
You guys ain't gonna fart
on me, are you?

24:24.880 --> 24:27.940
Long story short, we stomped those three
dudes so bad,

24:28.040 --> 24:30.486
they got to take
their boots off to piss.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.180
Anyway, that kinda ass-kicking fun is
an everyday thing for us

24:36.280 --> 24:39.762
and now you get to tell us who to kick,
and in which ass.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.460
All right, man.

24:43.560 --> 24:46.404
Well, kind of like monkey see,
monkey do, I like that.

24:46.720 --> 24:50.805
Okay. How about this? I need a vet,
'cause these puppies are sick.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.971
I need a vet,
'cause these puppies are sick.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.889
Not bad, I'm a good leader.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.620
But I'm actually not. I'm no good.

24:59.720 --> 25:03.406
I know I couldn't lead a colony of ants
to a melting Hershey Bar to be honest,

25:03.560 --> 25:04.561
believe me, I've tried.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.660
But I do have three daughters I want you
to meet.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.900
I've got a pretty wife, I'll bring her down.
We'll all have fun, maybe brunch.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.420
And by the way, you know,
all the kids stuff, blah blah.

25:12.520 --> 25:15.649
So no talking about fighting,
and drinking, and spitting,

25:15.760 --> 25:18.260
and punching, and kicking, you get it.
'Cause, you know,

25:18.360 --> 25:21.284
that kind of violent imagery
for a child, I don't want.

25:21.480 --> 25:26.460
Besides, this is the year 2015, I don't know
about even a motorcycle "gang" fighting...

25:26.560 --> 25:30.610
"2015"? It's not 2015. It's 1965.

25:31.920 --> 25:35.288
No, I'm sayin' now is 2015, June 2015.

25:35.600 --> 25:40.447
No, it's definitely June,
but it ain't no 2015, Mr. Dirt.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.122
This is June 1965.

25:43.600 --> 25:47.286
June 1965? Well if that's true, I'd be running
around in diapies, that's when I was born.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.205
I don't got no diapies on.

25:49.520 --> 25:52.620
But anyway, I like it here,
and I wanna meet everybody.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.802
And I think as a new leader,
I'm gonna name everybody.

25:55.080 --> 25:59.085
'Cause, you know, gangs have nicknames.
I think that's fun. I'm gonna start in the back.

25:59.640 --> 26:02.883
You think I'm ignoring you?
Back there, you got sort of a beak

26:03.400 --> 26:06.529
on your nose, like,
a little bit like a bird.

26:06.680 --> 26:09.809
What's a funny bird name?
"Bird" is not, that's too uninteresting.

26:10.200 --> 26:15.060
A mean one is vulture. You're Vulture
from now on, if anyone asks you, okay?

26:15.160 --> 26:16.605
Let's look around the room.

26:16.720 --> 26:20.520
All right, here we go,
there's Mean Marvin, No Soap Sam,

26:20.720 --> 26:24.700
Douche Bag, Jolly Mean Giant, Church
Burner, Fruit Loop, Palm Tree,

26:24.800 --> 26:28.691
Crazy Eyes, Dopey,
Inky, more like Stinky.

26:30.400 --> 26:33.882
We got Pillow Biter, Reload, No Nut,

26:34.160 --> 26:38.290
Momma Hates You, Gooey Load, Queefie,

26:38.520 --> 26:41.524
Jock Strap Jonny, okay,
Tea-Bagger Vance,

26:41.680 --> 26:42.681
Nucky Futz,

26:43.000 --> 26:47.483
Charlie Dog, Super Dumb, there's
Going to Hell, there's Gary.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.286
Con Artist Connie, One Eye, Two Eye,

26:52.520 --> 26:54.522
Two Eyes is no good.
Everybody has two eyes, right?

26:54.640 --> 26:58.780
I'm running out. Porn Stash,
Little Killer, Medium Killer,

26:58.880 --> 27:03.740
Flat Ass, Boogie Oogie, Cher,
Mitch the Bitch, Knee Caps, No Teeth.

27:03.840 --> 27:07.780
- Knock knock. Who's there? You're Ugly.
- "Ugly"?

27:07.880 --> 27:09.882
That whole thing is your nickname.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.881
And you are, I forgot you, Foggle.
How about, Lead Singer of Blue Oyster Cult.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.620
You'll get that one. That's funny.
You seen him? You get it good.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.980
Maybe the bass player, it's exact.

27:21.080 --> 27:24.971
Anyway, as your new leader,
I command ye to roll up your sleeves,

27:25.080 --> 27:28.482
and let's do some charity work.
Let's do some good for once, you know?

27:28.720 --> 27:32.770
Let's get out there and help, because that's
where we wanna be when Jesus comes back.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.088
Who's with me?
Come on now, let's do this.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.085
You hear that, everybody?

27:42.920 --> 27:45.764
That little queer wants us to
help people in need.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.081
Yeah?

27:49.360 --> 27:54.002
Is that queer, man? Is that queer?
Think this is queer?

27:54.160 --> 27:55.161
Yes.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.841
What?

27:57.160 --> 27:58.969
Well, next time
don't make it a question.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.850
You're all like, "Is this queer?"

28:01.000 --> 28:03.606
So that just walks you right into
the answer, which is yes.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.684
Just make it a statement, dumbass.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.446
Yeah? What about...

28:10.400 --> 28:13.085
Yeah, hey, Foggle, you're strong.

28:13.680 --> 28:17.480
Strong smellin', yeah.
Got ya, hold 'em up. Hold 'em up.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.689
- Got ya good.
- It took you that long to think of that?

28:20.880 --> 28:23.201
To be honest, I thought of it about
a week ago, and then

28:24.280 --> 28:26.123
I've been waiting to use it.

28:26.280 --> 28:28.180
But I didn't think I would.
It's been in the chamber loaded up,

28:28.280 --> 28:29.964
and guess who got it? You.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.682
Guess what else? I got your boots.

28:32.840 --> 28:35.020
You think you're gonna get 'em back?
Not quite, termite.

28:35.120 --> 28:38.010
- Give us those boots.
- I'm running away. Good luck catching me.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.406
Which way am I going?

28:40.600 --> 28:41.601
Get back here!

28:42.320 --> 28:44.971
You ain't man enough to wear those boots.
You know that, Joe Dirt.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.500
You ain't nothing.
You know that in your heart.

28:47.600 --> 28:51.207
We will track you to the gates of hell.

28:51.920 --> 28:52.967
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

28:55.240 --> 28:56.241
Stupid Foggle.

28:57.280 --> 29:01.285
What a dumb name. He needs a cool name,
like Joe Dirtay.

29:02.360 --> 29:04.169
Hey, Foggle.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.371
Why don't you go play Boggle?

29:06.720 --> 29:09.644
God dang, that's so funny,
why didn't I say it?

29:10.320 --> 29:11.526
I think of all the good ones too late.

29:12.520 --> 29:15.126
Well, I got my tennis shoes,
and his stupid boots!

29:16.000 --> 29:17.445
Well, I don't need
these sneakers no more.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.521
Fetch that, Boggle!

29:21.880 --> 29:24.645
Man, it usually takes me 27 times. Nice.

29:24.920 --> 29:29.847
Hey, how come ya threw your sneakers up
over that power line?

29:31.360 --> 29:34.125
- Why? You've never seen that before?
- No, silly head!

29:35.840 --> 29:37.251
Silly head, 1965.

29:37.520 --> 29:40.888
I must've travelled through some sort of
vortex and tumbled through time,

29:41.320 --> 29:42.321
like a time traveler.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.047
I don't know what's happening.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.801
But I'll tell ya, that happens
in the future.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.940
We find out carbs are bad for ya,
just a heads up.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.884
Hey. You really from the future?

29:53.200 --> 29:54.201
Yeah, man.

29:54.520 --> 29:57.683
Maybe you should move down to Louisiana,
help me start my fishing business!

29:58.120 --> 30:00.441
You and I together, man, we could catch
a lot of shrimp!

30:00.880 --> 30:05.568
I mean, there's rock shrimp, Atlantic shrimp,
salt shrimp, boo-boo shrimp, tater shrimp,

30:05.720 --> 30:09.361
shrimp on a stick, shrimp remoulade, shrimp
in your pasta, you know what, fuck shrimp!

30:09.760 --> 30:12.300
Okay, so, no on the shrimp biz?

30:12.400 --> 30:14.482
What's the situation with your hair?

30:14.640 --> 30:15.880
Did I call your number?

30:16.400 --> 30:17.561
Are we in a deli?

30:17.720 --> 30:20.087
We are not. And I did not. Goodbye.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.963
Did you call number three yet?

30:23.280 --> 30:26.602
Did I call number... No, that was a metaphor,
this ain't really a bakery, man.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.446
Yeah, I know. I was just patiently
waiting my turn.

30:29.640 --> 30:32.086
You see that? He's patiently
waiting his turn, all right?

30:32.400 --> 30:34.607
That's nice, instead
of yelling out nonsense.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.087
Yeah, one day I'm gonna dig a hole.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.161
Well, that's great, man.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.980
See, there you go.
You're gonna have a great, big hole.

30:42.080 --> 30:44.481
It's gonna be the biggest one,
and I'm glad you're setting goals.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.444
It's gonna be in my living room.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.887
Yeah, well, you had me,
then you lost me there.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.540
- Are you married?
- I am married. Now, that's a normal question.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.371
- I'm married to Brandy. She's sweet.
- Wait a minute.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.888
Is she like a great big fat person?

30:58.440 --> 31:02.490
A great big fat person? She is not.
She's about 115, I'm guessing.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.526
I really wish those numbers
were turned around.

31:06.120 --> 31:07.451
Like 511?

31:07.880 --> 31:09.405
Well, then she'd be
a great big fat person.

31:09.560 --> 31:15.540
Yeah, no, I like her 115. Anything over,
like, 400 I'm not super attracted to.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.290
I'd like to cut her skin off,

31:17.720 --> 31:22.760
and then sew it together, so that
I could wear it as a human tracksuit.

31:25.120 --> 31:29.330
Maybe I'm hearing you wrong, it sounds
a little not normal, what you're saying?

31:29.600 --> 31:30.601
My name's Bob.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.643
If I had any friends,
they'd call me Buffalo Bob.

31:35.640 --> 31:39.281
Why don't you give me a call if your wife
ever becomes a great big fat person?

31:39.480 --> 31:41.721
Buffalo Bob, that sounds...

31:42.800 --> 31:45.644
You have no idea what kind of hell
I can bring you!

31:46.560 --> 31:49.380
All right, enough, you broken record!

31:49.480 --> 31:50.820
Does what it's told!

31:50.920 --> 31:53.685
Say it, don't spray it, brother! Dang.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.041
Buffalo Bob!

31:55.480 --> 31:56.481
Man!

31:56.880 --> 31:58.689
Was that all in my living room?

31:58.800 --> 32:00.131
'Cause that's step one.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.570
Gotta run. There's a huge crazy party
behind that shed.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.683
You can go, there's three tickets left.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.081
What are you up to?

32:12.680 --> 32:14.011
"Genghis Khan."

32:15.520 --> 32:16.681
Genghis Khan what?

32:29.240 --> 32:30.890
It's a comic book store?

32:32.280 --> 32:35.204
If I'm back in time,
I could maybe buy...

32:38.880 --> 32:39.881
Is that Brandy?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.001
Brandy!

33:04.720 --> 33:06.245
Like a beaut.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.210
You got that $5 you owe me?

33:13.560 --> 33:16.928
See, I was thinking, you know,
since we're both seniors now,

33:17.840 --> 33:21.287
maybe it's time we, you know...

33:22.080 --> 33:24.560
Wait a second. I think I see Jill.

33:25.240 --> 33:28.403
I've gotta go talk to her.
She needs help with her homework.

33:28.720 --> 33:29.721
All right.

33:30.080 --> 33:33.050
Homework is important.
I'll be here, waiting.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.281
Like always.

33:39.280 --> 33:42.409
Wow. That was a total red light.

33:42.760 --> 33:45.127
She gave you nothing but brake fluid.
You're smothered in it.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.521
So funny I forgot to laugh.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.331
Guess it's time to try the old
"Popcorn Surprise."

33:50.960 --> 33:51.961
What's a "Popcorn Surprise"?

33:52.800 --> 33:53.847
Listen up, here's the skinny.

33:54.840 --> 33:57.605
See, I put a hole through the bottom of
a large tub of popcorn.

33:57.960 --> 33:58.961
Does the popcorn fall out?

33:59.680 --> 34:01.409
I don't know, it doesn't matter,
all right?

34:01.720 --> 34:06.681
After I cut the hole through,
I put my thingy up through the hole.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.440
Wait, hold on now, fella, you lost me.
What's a thingy?

34:09.600 --> 34:11.045
Get smart and get smart fast!

34:11.480 --> 34:13.164
That thing you use to go number one?

34:14.320 --> 34:16.580
So that's what keeps the popcorn
from falling out.

34:16.679 --> 34:17.659
Makes sense.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.205
I guess so, but that's not the point.

34:19.480 --> 34:23.643
All right? Anyways, after I get my thingy
stuck up through the hole,

34:23.960 --> 34:28.170
she reaches to grab the popcorn,
presto! Handful of thingy!

34:29.960 --> 34:31.610
- That's cool.
- Spread the word around.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.260
- It's gonna be classic.
- Yeah, all right, all right!

34:34.360 --> 34:35.360
Go, go, go!

34:36.960 --> 34:38.928
So, he finally made his move on you?

34:39.159 --> 34:45.246
Yeah, he's sweet, but I don't have
those kind of feelings for him.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.820
You need to check
your temperature, girl,

34:47.920 --> 34:50.321
because he's the most
dreamiest boy in school.

34:50.440 --> 34:54.889
Brandy, hey, sorry.
I just ran five miles chasing you!

34:55.560 --> 34:56.561
What are you doing here?

34:57.720 --> 34:59.563
What are you wearing? That looks funny.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.526
I'm sorry, do I know you?

35:02.400 --> 35:04.846
- Brandy!
- And my name isn't Brandy.

35:05.800 --> 35:06.801
I'm Ashleen.

35:07.080 --> 35:09.740
Well, if it's 1965 and you're Ashleen...

35:09.840 --> 35:13.561
Yeah, it's 1965, strange-o.
What about it, you freaky guy?

35:14.280 --> 35:16.681
Oh, my God, are you Brandy's mom?

35:18.800 --> 35:22.566
I don't know what you're sayin', but I have
always liked the name Brandy.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.963
I could see me namin' a daughter that.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.362
Yeah, you can, 'cause you...

35:28.240 --> 35:31.244
Why are you talkin' to our girls, and what's
the deal with your hair, you weirdo?

35:31.600 --> 35:33.170
Yeah, show him your muscles, fellas.

35:33.280 --> 35:35.123
Maybe he'll scram. And scram fast.

35:36.040 --> 35:37.041
Check this out.

35:37.640 --> 35:38.641
Do you even lift?

35:41.760 --> 35:45.367
Listen, I better go, because these guys
are getting a little cranky.

35:45.640 --> 35:49.361
All right? So listen, Ashleen,
I think I came here to the past

35:49.480 --> 35:52.220
to fix something about myself, you know?

35:52.320 --> 35:55.483
So, I deserve the daughter
that you're gonna have one day.

35:57.480 --> 36:00.563
- I don't know what you mean.
- I don't know either.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.930
And by the way, do not eat
Jimmy's popcorn, okay?

36:04.360 --> 36:08.206
"Jimmy"? No, his name is Rory.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.601
Rory Yauch.

36:10.080 --> 36:15.100
Fudge! That's Jimmy's dad!
Man, this shit just got officially weird.

36:15.200 --> 36:18.090
Hey, you watch your language,
buddy boy fella!

36:18.600 --> 36:19.840
You want a big bar of soap
in your mouth?

36:20.280 --> 36:21.281
Hey, are you a vet?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.245
'Cause these puppies are sick.

36:23.840 --> 36:27.447
Yeah, you like that one? Talk to the fist,
'cause the hand is pissed.

36:27.640 --> 36:30.450
Those are from the future!
You just got futurized.

36:30.680 --> 36:33.126
You got a burn, and it came down from
the future and got you.

36:33.400 --> 36:36.961
You're a little dazed right now,
it'll go away. But don't fight it, just...

36:37.440 --> 36:39.329
Hey, he's gonna give you
the "Popcorn Surprise."

36:40.040 --> 36:41.405
What's a "Popcorn Surprise"?

36:41.840 --> 36:44.020
I'll give you a hint, it's more surprise
than popcorn, okay?

36:44.120 --> 36:46.282
Just promise me you don't put your hand
in that cup, all right?

36:47.160 --> 36:48.685
Just think of me as your guardian angel,
all right?

36:49.720 --> 36:51.688
Looking out for the love of my life.

36:52.920 --> 36:53.921
Bye!

37:01.800 --> 37:04.610
How are you, son?
This movie's a hoot, isn't it?

37:04.880 --> 37:06.940
Dad, what are you doin' here? Mom!

37:07.040 --> 37:08.041
I want some popcorn.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.446
No, no!

37:11.120 --> 37:12.451
Don't, stop!

37:15.200 --> 37:16.361
Don't stop, don't stop!

37:17.080 --> 37:18.060
I like it.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.161
Don't stop, don't stop!

37:19.400 --> 37:20.526
It won't come out!

37:21.280 --> 37:22.281
Yeah.

37:22.560 --> 37:23.561
Yeah.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.321
Yeah.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.081
Oh, my God.

37:38.560 --> 37:42.804
Man, old comic books in mint condition
for 10 cents apiece.

37:43.360 --> 37:44.361
Not bad.

37:44.600 --> 37:47.968
Give Joe Dirt lemons,
he gonna make goldenade.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.569
Nah, lemonade, he gonna make lemonade.

37:55.720 --> 37:57.245
This must be why I'm here.

37:58.040 --> 37:59.041
To get rich.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.723
So my girls will love me for real,
instead of the loser that I am.

38:03.920 --> 38:04.921
I'll buy 'em presents.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.500
Yeah.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.285
This one is gonna buy Abilene braces.

38:10.640 --> 38:13.928
This one's gonna buy braces for Dakota.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.883
And this one. What can I get Cheyenne?

38:18.720 --> 38:19.721
I can get braces.

38:20.960 --> 38:26.046
And this, Brandy, you're gonna get
a new used car!

38:29.720 --> 38:33.725
Don't worry, little tree, that won't hurt ya.
You're gonna grow up big and strong.

38:34.640 --> 38:38.087
Pretty nice. Take that, Home Depot.
Life's a garden, dig it!

38:41.400 --> 38:44.882
Well that was easy. Now that I'm rich,
I'm gonna get back to my trailer.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.651
'Cause that's where
this whole thing started,

38:46.760 --> 38:49.047
and maybe that's where
this whole thing ends.

38:52.600 --> 38:53.806
No, no, no.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.762
No, no, no. Crap.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.287
Well, well, well.

39:06.840 --> 39:07.921
If it isn't Joe Dirt.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.481
Hey, Foggle.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.820
Now see, when I ride with a man like this guy,
I got a nice thick phonebook between us.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.763
Like this thing right here.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.127
That way we're not really
touching each other.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.100
Right.

39:21.200 --> 39:24.682
Now, Joe here, if he were to
ride behind a man,

39:25.280 --> 39:29.922
he probably wouldn't have a phonebook
dividing him from the other man.

39:31.560 --> 39:35.940
No, no, no. He would say, "No, I don't need
no phonebook in between us,

39:36.040 --> 39:37.963
"because I'd rather be nice and cozy."

39:41.280 --> 39:44.887
Or if he puts something in between him
and the other man,

39:45.320 --> 39:48.642
he would want it to be a little
bit thinner, like a magazine.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.801
Or like a menu.

39:54.440 --> 39:57.523
- A really thin menu.
- Like a Kleenex.

40:00.560 --> 40:01.971
You wish you'd thought of Kleenex.

40:02.640 --> 40:03.641
I want those boots, Joe.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.371
Foggle, look what I'm doing.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.260
I'm takin' 'em off.

40:07.360 --> 40:08.820
You know you ain't man enough
to wear those boots.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.046
- You give 'em to me, boy.
- No.

40:10.320 --> 40:13.085
What if I unzipped
and rubbed 'em on my private parts?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.126
You wouldn't like that!

40:15.280 --> 40:17.089
You don't put that nowhere
near your thingy!

40:17.840 --> 40:18.900
That scare you?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.731
I'll do it. Yeah, I'm crazy, I do it!

40:22.600 --> 40:27.527
Look, here come the police! Too bad 'cause
you're the bad guy, I'm the good guy.

40:27.680 --> 40:28.681
Hey!

40:30.640 --> 40:31.580
Are you Joe Dirt?

40:31.680 --> 40:35.446
Yeah, hey there, hi there, ho there, Officer,
what is crappenin'?

40:35.880 --> 40:36.881
Figured it was you.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.367
You had that weird hairdo
they said you called a "mullet."

40:39.520 --> 40:40.885
Yeah, that's me.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.491
Did you buy comic books
with this here money?

40:44.600 --> 40:46.568
Yeah, you know I did, that's right.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.140
Well, then, you're under arrest
for using counterfeit money.

40:49.240 --> 40:52.050
What, no! It ain't counterfeit,
it's future money!

40:52.400 --> 40:53.890
From my future pocket!

40:54.000 --> 40:55.729
You just tell that to them
down at the station.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.651
I'm under arrest so those guys
can't kill me now!

40:59.200 --> 41:00.850
- What guys?
- Those guys!

41:02.160 --> 41:03.780
See ya later, I'm innocent, sorry!

41:03.880 --> 41:04.980
Hey, get back here!

41:05.080 --> 41:06.320
I bumped your car, sorry!

41:06.600 --> 41:07.580
Come on, we gotta go get him.

41:07.680 --> 41:10.047
Pursuit on foot going west on Hartford.

41:10.520 --> 41:11.885
It ain't over, Joe Dirt.

41:12.760 --> 41:15.161
We're your personal demons from hell!

41:17.200 --> 41:18.201
Let's go.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.561
Where's my phonebook?

41:22.880 --> 41:26.407
So I was on the lam. They even let the dogs
out on me and everything.

41:26.560 --> 41:29.848
But I got away, man, I pretended to be
a scarecrow in a field.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.929
Them stupid cops, they never caught me.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.401
What about the dogs?

41:34.440 --> 41:36.408
The dogs, I dunno, I don't remember.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.290
Anyway, so there I was, on the run.

41:38.760 --> 41:39.921
Escape from the police.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.322
Police dogs have a real good
sense of smell.

41:42.640 --> 41:45.849
Even if you were a scarecrow,
how could the dogs not find you?

41:46.320 --> 41:47.970
You know, they did find me,

41:48.200 --> 41:50.601
but I got lucky, they just walked away.

41:51.440 --> 41:54.842
How did they just walk away?
I mean, they just walked away?

41:55.040 --> 41:57.930
They knocked me over on the pole on
the ground, and they just walked away!

41:58.040 --> 41:59.180
I dunno, they had dog stuff to do.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.500
You're focusing on the wrong part
of the story.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.420
I can't imagine.
Why would they just walk away?

42:02.520 --> 42:05.603
God dang, with the dogs!
Who gives a care?

42:06.120 --> 42:08.805
The dogs, all right,
you gotta solve the case!

42:09.280 --> 42:11.726
All right, they all humped me,
is that what you wanna know?

42:12.040 --> 42:16.045
You found it out, Nancy Drew,
you solved the case of the horny dogs.

42:17.960 --> 42:18.961
No, no!

42:24.200 --> 42:25.964
Well, glad you got
a good chuckle out of it.

42:27.120 --> 42:29.168
It was terrible,
I was man's best friend!

42:29.880 --> 42:32.121
More like, man's best friend
with benefits.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.330
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42:34.600 --> 42:38.889
I don't know if you started the "dogs like to
hump people's legs" fad,

42:39.480 --> 42:43.326
but think about it, you started
the shoes on the line, and the mullet.

42:44.240 --> 42:49.485
You know, you might be like
the white trash Johnny Appleseed.

42:50.240 --> 42:51.765
Well, maybe.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.563
You know, once I extricated myself from
the dog pile,

42:55.880 --> 42:59.407
they were done, basically,
once they got the money shot,

42:59.720 --> 43:00.801
if you get my drift,

43:01.120 --> 43:02.167
which I hope you don't.

43:02.360 --> 43:04.442
- God.
- Anyway,

43:04.560 --> 43:06.927
so there I was, on the run.
I was runnin' through the night,

43:07.920 --> 43:08.921
and you can't believe what I saw.

43:11.640 --> 43:12.641
Ruby's.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.368
I like any place that sounds
like "boobies."

43:15.680 --> 43:16.681
Man.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.291
Where's the crowd when you need 'em?

43:18.520 --> 43:20.045
I got some LOLs going.

43:41.560 --> 43:44.530
Man, that singer looks like a young
Ronnie Van Zant.

43:49.640 --> 43:52.883
Wait. That's Ronnie. Bob. Gary.

43:53.560 --> 43:55.130
Oh, my God! This is Lynyrd Skynyrd!

43:55.720 --> 43:56.801
Before they were Skynyrd!

43:57.080 --> 43:58.411
What?

43:58.640 --> 43:59.721
Man!

44:09.360 --> 44:11.966
Man, you guys are so good.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.600
So, you really dug our sound?

44:14.920 --> 44:18.242
I do think you guys have potential.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.761
Well, cool, 'cause we're just
barely scratchin' by.

44:21.080 --> 44:22.020
Not makin' a dime.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.282
Well, I think that's all gonna change.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.846
But I have one criticism,
and do not take this the wrong way.

44:29.280 --> 44:33.888
I'm just saying, maybe tinker with the name
of the band, you know?

44:34.200 --> 44:35.201
You don't like "The Wildcats"?

44:36.480 --> 44:38.608
No, yeah, no, I don't.

44:38.760 --> 44:43.641
Actually, because "Wildcats" is too, like,
generic and boring, like any animal.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.651
It's like "meerkat," you know?

44:46.280 --> 44:47.725
You know Meerkat Manor? You don't, no.

44:48.120 --> 44:50.885
But it needs to be
more distinct, I feel.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.380
- Distinct?
- Yeah.

44:52.480 --> 44:55.180
I mean, this is rock and roll.
A name means everything, man.

44:55.280 --> 44:56.805
All the cool bands have cool names.

44:57.200 --> 44:59.168
You wanna kick ass,
you want it to stand out.

44:59.600 --> 45:03.844
Wildcats, I just don't think it does it, man.
Do you got any other ideas?

45:04.600 --> 45:07.922
Yeah, I got one. What about "Wham!"?

45:08.240 --> 45:09.685
"Wham!"? What?

45:09.960 --> 45:11.450
It sounds kickass, right?

45:11.680 --> 45:12.806
It's like, Wham!

45:13.360 --> 45:15.727
It says, if you mess with us,
we'll beat you down!

45:16.280 --> 45:17.441
We'll blow you away!

45:17.760 --> 45:21.128
We don't care where, in a dark alley
or in a public toilet.

45:22.120 --> 45:26.808
I feel like "Wham!" is just, gut instinct,
not the way to go.

45:27.040 --> 45:28.166
What about "Frankie Goes To Hollywood"?

45:28.360 --> 45:29.361
Absolutely not.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.931
- What about "Cher"?
- "Cher"?

45:31.040 --> 45:32.380
What about "Air Supply"?

45:32.480 --> 45:34.164
Oh, my God, be real!

45:34.400 --> 45:35.765
- What about "Kajagoogoo"?
- What?

45:36.000 --> 45:37.001
"New Kids On The Block"?

45:37.160 --> 45:38.321
What, we're getting colder!

45:38.560 --> 45:40.289
Okay, you said
we're gonna be big, right?

45:40.640 --> 45:43.020
Going straight to the top.
All right, then "One Direction"!

45:43.120 --> 45:44.260
What is crappenin'?

45:44.360 --> 45:46.980
Nah, I'd do "Pet Shop Boys," though.

45:47.080 --> 45:50.060
What about "Spice Boys"?
That's pretty good. Yeah.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.845
Come on, man, we need
some contenders here, what is this crap?

45:53.200 --> 45:55.567
I got one. Now get ready for this, okay?

45:56.280 --> 45:57.327
It's a little outta left field.

45:57.840 --> 45:59.251
But be open-minded.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.401
Lynyrd Skynyrd.

46:01.680 --> 46:03.011
No.

46:03.880 --> 46:04.881
- Not that guy.
- That's like our gym coach's name.

46:05.680 --> 46:06.660
We don't even like that guy.

46:06.760 --> 46:09.001
I know legend has it
it's your gym coach.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.201
What legend?

46:11.360 --> 46:12.361
That's a long story.

46:12.480 --> 46:16.769
But seriously, guys, I know he's your coach,
but you change it a little bit.

46:17.080 --> 46:22.220
You add a "D," you add a random "Y,"
another renegade "Y" over here,

46:22.320 --> 46:25.483
and then it's Lynyrd Skynyrd and
presto-change-o, people remember that!

46:26.080 --> 46:28.780
- No, that guy gave me lice...
- I dunno about Lynyrd Skynyrd, man.

46:28.880 --> 46:31.940
You remember that time he chased the other
coach around in his underwear in the gym?

46:32.040 --> 46:33.883
- The guy's just whacked out.
- But you're...

46:42.680 --> 46:44.444
Oh, my God, that's so good.

46:45.600 --> 46:46.601
Man.

46:47.720 --> 46:53.568
Trust me, you guys are gonna be big,
that song is so perfect, I'm telling you,

46:53.680 --> 46:58.004
that's like an anthem, like a Southern
toe-tapper to say the least, man.

46:58.560 --> 47:01.723
On the huge-ometer,
it's gonna break the needle.

47:02.360 --> 47:04.806
- Like a big wedding song?
- More like divorce.

47:04.960 --> 47:07.531
Really? Where does it go, man?
It's too slow.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.171
Too slow, listen to this guy!

47:10.120 --> 47:11.690
Oh, my God, it's gonna be nine minutes!

47:12.000 --> 47:12.980
Nine-minute tune?

47:13.080 --> 47:16.243
Yeah, I know, I mean, it could be.
It could be 9:08.

47:16.800 --> 47:17.801
Nine minutes, eight seconds, yeah.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.004
When you've got it that good,
don't rush it.

47:20.320 --> 47:23.529
What I would do, I would talk
at the beginning, sing sing,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.606
if it's about a bird, you know,
lettin' it go free.

47:26.920 --> 47:29.605
And then maybe just kill some time
in the middle with an instrumental.

47:29.800 --> 47:32.246
Like, anything. I would probably go...

47:42.480 --> 47:43.970
Yeah. Yeah.

47:45.080 --> 47:46.320
Man! You got it!

47:46.600 --> 47:49.540
I kid you not, like I said,
you're gonna be rich and famous,

47:49.640 --> 47:51.608
trust the shit outta me on this one!

47:51.800 --> 47:57.020
Yeah? Big rock stars with a truck full of
money and girls and jammin' into the night,

47:57.120 --> 47:59.487
- livin' the great life?
- You know it, man! Exactly!

47:59.800 --> 48:02.280
Everyone's gonna look up to you,
you're gonna have tons of fans,

48:02.600 --> 48:05.251
your kids are gonna be proud of you,
your family's gonna have so much money.

48:05.600 --> 48:06.540
You could buy anything you want.

48:06.640 --> 48:08.529
- We could buy our own airplane.
- Yeah!

48:14.320 --> 48:15.321
What's the matter?

48:23.000 --> 48:24.445
You guys, it was nice
to meet you, but...

48:28.200 --> 48:30.726
You're gonna be great, man. I gotta go.

48:41.760 --> 48:44.047
I was eight years old when I heard
about that plane crash.

48:46.160 --> 48:49.369
Just goes to show, you never really
know what's going on in people's lives.

48:49.520 --> 48:52.490
You know, everything could look great,
and you could wish you were them,

48:53.800 --> 48:57.168
- but then...
- Sounds like a lesson in there.

48:59.360 --> 49:00.805
Yeah, I know there's a lesson,

49:01.000 --> 49:04.209
and I know I was supposed to walk into that
club and meet Skynyrd that night,

49:04.720 --> 49:06.006
but I ain't real smart,

49:06.200 --> 49:08.521
and my head always feels
all jingly jangly,

49:08.720 --> 49:12.167
which is a Southern term meaning,
gangly wangly.

49:12.360 --> 49:16.180
There's always noise in it, like, if people
are dropping change in there

49:16.280 --> 49:18.089
and not picking up the pennies.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.363
It makes me crazy, man.

49:20.880 --> 49:23.140
But then when I think
I'm startin' to figure stuff out,

49:23.240 --> 49:24.890
along come these assholes.

49:27.600 --> 49:29.250
Let's get us that Joe Dirt!

49:31.520 --> 49:33.170
Get back here with those boots!

49:34.880 --> 49:36.325
You little bitch.

49:37.320 --> 49:38.731
Don't you get on that train!

49:39.000 --> 49:40.843
Don't you get on that train!

49:45.040 --> 49:46.804
Take that, Foggle! What a burn!

49:51.320 --> 49:52.321
Made it.

49:54.080 --> 49:56.811
And so there I was,
just clickety-clackin' through the night.

49:58.640 --> 50:03.521
I got to thinking, how does this Foggle dude
and all of them always know where I am?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.207
It's almost like they're livin'
inside my head, you know?

50:06.680 --> 50:09.047
I mean, there's definitely
a lot of empty space in there.

50:09.240 --> 50:12.940
But where would they put their motorcycles,
where would they go to the bathroom?

50:13.040 --> 50:14.041
Whatever.

50:14.920 --> 50:16.126
I'm sick of being alone.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.569
I wish Brandy was here right now.

50:22.120 --> 50:23.645
I can pretend she's here.

50:25.320 --> 50:26.685
I got a few minutes.

50:29.680 --> 50:32.650
Okay. In the bedroom.

50:33.840 --> 50:37.049
I come up behind. Tickle her back.

50:37.960 --> 50:42.124
Pull that scrunchie out.
Yeah, get the hair down.

50:44.280 --> 50:46.282
Pick up the pace, pick up the pace.

50:47.800 --> 50:48.801
Sorry, buddy.

50:49.800 --> 50:50.801
Had to light my cigar.

50:51.640 --> 50:54.020
Show was just starting. Keep goin'.

50:54.120 --> 50:55.281
Nah, you didn't see nothing.

50:55.440 --> 50:56.521
Yeah, we did.

50:56.640 --> 50:58.940
You over there lookin'
like a paint shaker goin' at it.

50:59.040 --> 51:00.201
Can we get in on that action?

51:00.480 --> 51:03.660
Yeah, maybe we can figure out some kinda
naked pyramid or something.

51:03.760 --> 51:06.220
- I like that idea.
- Come on, little doggy.

51:06.320 --> 51:09.085
I ain't no party boy.

51:12.600 --> 51:15.001
Just a dream. Thank God.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.081
Again?

51:17.760 --> 51:20.843
But this time, not just them.

51:21.480 --> 51:22.527
You get us, too.

51:22.880 --> 51:23.900
Okay.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.161
You like sausages, Joe?

51:25.400 --> 51:28.620
I like sausage, I usually get bacon,
but I mix it up.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.324
I like to have fun
at breakfast, you know?

51:30.560 --> 51:32.688
Maybe you should take
a little nibble off mine.

51:34.320 --> 51:35.845
No, that's not supposed to be there.

51:35.960 --> 51:36.961
Don't walk here!

51:37.160 --> 51:38.366
You guys on Viagra?

51:38.800 --> 51:39.801
No!

51:42.560 --> 51:43.561
It's me, Joe.

51:43.840 --> 51:46.923
Kicking Wing? Holy crap on a crutch!

51:47.480 --> 51:50.165
- What's up?
- I missed you.

51:50.840 --> 51:53.286
But they don't call me
Kicking Wing anymore,

51:53.640 --> 51:54.766
I'm Kicking Ass.

51:55.320 --> 51:58.020
- I took your advice.
- Man! That's a good one.

51:58.120 --> 51:59.724
That's cool, I got tons
of good ideas, man.

52:00.040 --> 52:02.168
So, where have you been,
how's the fireworks game?

52:03.240 --> 52:07.086
I'm not in the fireworks game, Joe.
Growth potential wasn't enough.

52:08.120 --> 52:09.121
I'm a drug dealer now.

52:09.520 --> 52:11.443
What! You don't do drugs.

52:11.720 --> 52:13.290
I don't get high on my supply.

52:13.640 --> 52:14.721
That's catchy.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.246
Baby, who's this clown?

52:16.920 --> 52:19.287
This is the legendary Joe Dirt!

52:19.880 --> 52:20.881
Good friend!

52:21.200 --> 52:22.884
So, you sell heroin
and all that kinda crap?

52:23.240 --> 52:25.561
No. Just aspirin and weed.

52:25.960 --> 52:28.406
What! I can get aspirin from a baby!

52:28.800 --> 52:31.087
I can get weed
in a vending machine in Denver!

52:31.360 --> 52:33.408
'Cause you know what, no one
gives a care about weed any more.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.561
Understand, rubber band?

52:35.080 --> 52:38.402
Well, aspirin and weed
is the ones I like.

52:38.560 --> 52:43.202
Well, that's your problem.
You're not sellin' to the mirror, my man!

52:43.680 --> 52:46.780
You're forgetting
about the consumer! Again.

52:46.880 --> 52:48.245
I'm a really good drug dealer.

52:48.400 --> 52:53.860
Kim Possible, you're gonna stand there,
calling yourself "a really good drug dealer,"

52:53.960 --> 52:55.580
and you ain't got no crystal meth?

52:55.680 --> 52:56.660
No black tar?

52:56.760 --> 52:58.410
These are the basics!

52:58.760 --> 53:03.891
No Xanny bars? White crosses? Special K?
Moon rocks? No zip-its, pop-its, whippits?

53:04.280 --> 53:09.500
Black beauties or cocaine? Also known as yayo,
power flour, talk chalk, devil's dandruff

53:09.600 --> 53:10.886
or sniffy jiffy?

53:11.520 --> 53:13.363
- No.
- No shanaynay?

53:13.600 --> 53:14.601
No vajayjay?

53:14.840 --> 53:17.446
No. Just aspirins and weed.

53:17.640 --> 53:21.201
So, you're supposed to be taken seriously in
your chosen new profession?

53:21.400 --> 53:24.927
And you don't move no purple microdot?
No gold paint to huff?

53:25.320 --> 53:26.300
No angel dust?

53:26.400 --> 53:29.060
PCP? Molly? Charlie? Charlie Car? Crank?

53:29.160 --> 53:31.900
Ice? Crack? Boom? Pow?
Shnizzle? Zoomers?

53:32.000 --> 53:33.126
Boomers? Husker Dus?

53:34.120 --> 53:35.884
Wait, I think that's
a firecracker, isn't it?

53:36.280 --> 53:37.281
No, it's both.

53:37.440 --> 53:42.571
No yellow jackets, morning wood, or one
single bottle of codeine cough syrup?

53:43.120 --> 53:44.804
With or without the Jolly Rancher.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.610
You must get high all the time.

53:46.960 --> 53:47.961
You seem psycho.

53:48.560 --> 53:49.561
Wait, was this a dream?

53:49.800 --> 53:50.961
Yeah, this is gonna be a dream.

53:51.360 --> 53:53.647
Then I can say somethin' mean back.
All right, say it again.

53:54.040 --> 53:55.769
You must get high all the time.
You seem psycho.

53:56.280 --> 53:58.362
You must bone a lot of dudes.
You seem like a whore.

54:04.120 --> 54:06.361
- I do.
- Backfire!

54:07.000 --> 54:09.241
I'm so glad this is a dream
and you ain't a drug dealer!

54:09.600 --> 54:11.180
You're right, Joe, it is a dream.

54:11.280 --> 54:13.851
Come on, Kicking Ass, kick him
off the train, I wanna get high.

54:14.360 --> 54:17.860
Don't you understand, Joe? This whole
dream represents you trying to become

54:17.960 --> 54:19.610
something you shouldn't be.

54:21.960 --> 54:23.200
Think about that, Joe.

54:25.600 --> 54:28.570
Man, it was great to see Kicking Wing,
but not as a drug dealer.

54:29.320 --> 54:32.847
And that's when it hit me.
What he was trying to tell me!

54:33.400 --> 54:36.449
What he wanted me to figure out was...
Then I got sleepy.

54:38.440 --> 54:40.010
Yo! Molly Mulletson.

54:41.480 --> 54:43.881
It's me, the clumsy segue fairy.

54:44.680 --> 54:45.647
You're dreamin'.

54:45.760 --> 54:49.048
We're inside a dream
that's inside a daydream

54:49.520 --> 54:52.888
that's being influenced by
a vague sense of ennui.

54:53.040 --> 54:56.123
And this is Joe Dirt 2, and why have we
overwritten this?

54:56.280 --> 54:59.921
Now go back to sleep, you're gonna wake up
in the middle of nowhere.

55:00.200 --> 55:01.201
REM.

55:01.880 --> 55:05.327
Them dreams is trying to tell me somethin'.
Especially Kicking Wing!

55:05.680 --> 55:07.728
I don't even know what
Zander Kelly was doin' in there.

55:07.920 --> 55:10.685
And I have no idea what
"on we" means either.

55:11.240 --> 55:13.891
All in all, I was startin' to feel like
Alice in Wonderland.

55:14.120 --> 55:15.884
You know, if Alice was a cool dude

55:16.040 --> 55:19.647
and Wonderland was a place where
everyone benches a lot.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.321
You're cool, and...

55:22.160 --> 55:25.243
Yeah, that's a bad comparison, but
things was definitely getting weirder.

55:27.640 --> 55:29.449
Hey, guys, what's crappenin'?

55:30.080 --> 55:31.081
What's your name?

55:31.960 --> 55:36.602
Well, listen, it's a bit unusual
and I've heard all the jokes

55:36.880 --> 55:39.087
and I've heard them about my hair,
so you might as well skip it.

55:39.440 --> 55:40.441
It's Joe Dirt.

55:40.880 --> 55:43.900
Dirt? That's a pretty shitty name,
don't you think?

55:44.000 --> 55:45.140
Yeah, I guess
we're not going to skip it.

55:45.240 --> 55:49.450
Yeah, listen, it could've been Connor or
Willow or Aiden or Jaden

55:49.560 --> 55:51.085
or maybe Colby or Tristan...

55:51.440 --> 55:52.441
How's your health?

55:53.040 --> 55:54.769
That's a bit personal.

55:55.320 --> 55:58.802
My health is good, I feel like it might get
worse in a few minutes...

55:59.360 --> 56:00.361
You ain't a smoker, huh?

56:01.240 --> 56:03.129
No, but I do dip Skoal.

56:03.280 --> 56:04.964
Just a pinch between my cheek and gum.

56:05.240 --> 56:07.561
I've tried Cope, you know, between us.

56:08.080 --> 56:10.526
But it's a little strong. I get dizzy.

56:10.800 --> 56:13.406
I like to call it the poor man's
amusement ride.

56:13.920 --> 56:15.365
You're about to go on a big ride.

56:37.520 --> 56:39.443
Bright light!

56:44.440 --> 56:46.044
Sore to the touch!

56:47.480 --> 56:50.324
Somebody's getting
a bad stitchin' award.

56:50.880 --> 56:51.881
What did they do?

56:56.040 --> 56:59.044
Seashell? I'm at the beach!

57:01.240 --> 57:02.810
Sandcastle time!

57:04.280 --> 57:07.523
- So they harvested me.
- What?

57:08.360 --> 57:09.361
Yeah.

57:09.640 --> 57:13.201
- Harvested you?
- Yeah, they dug deep. They got my kidney,

57:14.000 --> 57:16.002
they got my gallbladder,
they got some liver parts.

57:16.120 --> 57:18.202
I guess they were making some cat food or
something, I dunno.

57:18.480 --> 57:21.370
I thought that was just,
like, an urban legend.

57:21.680 --> 57:23.170
- How creepy.
- Yeah. Yeah.

57:23.280 --> 57:25.123
You know, maybe I started that.

57:25.760 --> 57:29.924
After the surgery, they left all kinds
of crap inside me, like, you know.

57:30.160 --> 57:31.969
- On accident, I'm guessin'.
- What?

57:32.360 --> 57:37.764
They left scissors inside me,
they left a hamburger wrapper,

57:38.680 --> 57:42.140
39 cents in change, and some of those
plastic pluggy things

57:42.240 --> 57:44.242
that you stick in a corn cob
to hold it better?

57:44.840 --> 57:48.003
Also one of them cans that says moo
when you turn it upside down?

57:48.560 --> 57:50.324
- No.
- You say, no?

57:50.880 --> 57:51.881
Hang on.

57:53.680 --> 57:54.681
There we go.

57:58.040 --> 57:59.041
It's nice to see you laughin'.

57:59.320 --> 58:02.927
My little girls would laugh so hard at that.
They'd think it's so funny.

58:04.680 --> 58:05.681
I wish I could hear that.

58:06.240 --> 58:09.722
- So, where was this beach?
- Actually, it was a desert island.

58:10.240 --> 58:11.730
I was there a long time.

58:12.520 --> 58:16.047
About 12 years.

58:20.280 --> 58:23.660
"Dear Whoever Finds This
Message in a Bottle, I'm trapped

58:23.760 --> 58:27.242
"on a desert island, and I'm losing
hope of ever being found, man.

58:28.160 --> 58:33.060
"I probably just wasted time writing the
word 'man,' it wasn't a necessary word

58:33.160 --> 58:35.367
"and I don't have much ink,
so that's dumb.

58:43.800 --> 58:45.325
"I'm using my own blood.

58:45.840 --> 58:48.810
"I'm crossing off 'man.
' Sorry for the mess.

58:48.920 --> 58:51.764
"As I gaze out to sea at
the rocks that look like

58:51.880 --> 58:54.220
"a giant church steeple,
it makes me think of

58:54.320 --> 58:56.641
"the day I married the love
of my life, Brandy.

58:57.840 --> 59:02.687
"I miss her. I miss my girls.
I'm lonely out my ass.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.820
"I hope somebody gets this and replies.

59:05.920 --> 59:09.811
"PS, No smokers. I'm just kidding.

59:10.120 --> 59:13.647
"Signed, Joe Dirtay.

59:19.840 --> 59:24.482
"PPS, AKA Joe Dirt. I ain't foolin' nobody
with the Dirtay thing. I'll give up on it."

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.763
Tastes like jellyfish.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.620
Oh, yeah. You like that, Wilson?

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.405
You're not getting away!
Yeah, take that!

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.740
Okay, this one goes out to all
the angel fish out there.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.411
You know who you are.
Let them in the front. Come on now.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.300
You like that, shell?

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.165
Hey, which way out? I need an exit sign.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.881
There you are.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.406
Sorry for the delay, folks.
I took a crap.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.562
I buried it. I put some sand on it.
It's not totally gone, but...

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.803
Nobody go looking for it.
I didn't think you would.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.610
I hope this is mine.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:53.020
"Dear Joe Dirt,
you sound so lonely and lost.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.140
"And as I gaze out of my
Marriott Hotel window,

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.820
"I can see the same church-steeple rocks
you mention in your letter.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.380
"Anyway, what hotel are you staying in?

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.324
"I'm in room 347.
Write me back or call."

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.291
Marriott?

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.170
What the fuck!

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:31.451
Twelve years I missed going to effing,
freaking, fucking Taco Bell?

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.529
Hey, mister.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.220
Are you Bigfoot?

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.971
What? No, man. No, I'm not Bigfoot.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.367
I'm tired-foot.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.611
Hey, Bigfoot, why did you climb all those
rocks over there instead of using this trail?

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.580
- What year is it?
- It's 1977, Bigfoot.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.921
Man, what city am I in?

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.247
It's Miami, Bigfoot.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.681
Man.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.300
I need to go down just to wipe.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.802
It's rough down there. I've been wiping
with seaweed and clamshells for 12 years.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.331
Gross, Bigfoot.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.727
- Bye, Bigfoot.
- You gotta get going? Okay.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.604
Yeah, see ya later, Bigfoot.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.649
Okay. I'll catch ya later.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.780
Maybe I'll write it in a bottle
and throw it to ya.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.848
I'm kidding. Wait, is this the way down?

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.980
Twenty-seven cents
for all-new JD threads.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.289
Now I just gotta get the bugs
out of my hair.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.085
Skynyrd, man. Those poor guys.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.100
I'm complaining about my stupid problems,
and these guys...

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.409
Screw them, man! I was on an island for
10 years. I'm in Florida!

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.247
What a dumb crap! I just get stupider!

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.764
Wait a second. Is that dude, Clem?

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.326
Wait, that's Clem!

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.721
Hey, Clem!

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.921
I'm sorry, excuse me.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.606
Hey, hey, Clem.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.220
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.367
Clem, hey.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.164
Mr. Bennedetti, I'm sorry. My name's Joe Dirt,
I'm from the future. I know it sounds crazy.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.485
I heard about the future.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.010
Everybody's got a big head, right?
Enlarged. Eat pills to live.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.126
You fly around with a jetpack.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.565
Not quite yet.
I mean, we have a Bedazzler.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.806
Jetpacks are not at the Walmart
just as of now.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.645
But we have the Cronut.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:33.323
It's really doing well. I ate 30 once. I was
drunk. It was like 28, but I brag and say 30.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:37.600
But here's the real thing, in the future, I just
want to tell you, it sounds crazy, I know,

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.721
but we're friends.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.220
You're like a dad to me.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.291
I mean, we hang out and you live
in Silvertown. You save me from bullies.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.929
Vinny, whack this kid.
He's talking nonsense.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.762
Then dump his body in a trunk, then dump
his crazy hair in a different trunk.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.441
- You got it, Uncle Frank.
- No, no, Mr. Vinny, wait one sec...

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.489
I'm telling you I'm from the future.
I'll prove it.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:58.921
There's a TV.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.540
What's that, NASCAR?

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.641
I know NASCAR.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:06.010
That's Daytona 500, I bet.
I can tell you who wins. Is that good?

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.809
If this was true,
you would become very important.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:13.044
You've got five seconds.
I start counting on three.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.646
What? Wait, what happened
to one and two?

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.300
I had them whacked. Four.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.129
Wait. God... Okay, hold on.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.369
Daytona Speedway, 1977.
That's, oh, my God, Richard Petty, I think.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.420
STP car.

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.620
Then you got Darrel Waltrip in Gatorade.
AJ Foyt is third.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.963
- Then Donnie Allison, and who's fifth?
- Five.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.488
Cale Yarborough! Go! Yeah! Yeah!

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.641
Yeah!

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.526
Guys, we just found a goose
that lays the golden eggs.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.520
- I laid 'em.
- This goose's name is, what?

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.001
- I'm Joe Dirt!
- Joe Dirt.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:50.881
Joe Dirt.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:52.681
Okay.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.361
It's all right.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.049
This was all paying off.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.564
We was getting richer.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.724
I was getting richer.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:34.010
- Look, I did a perfect cartwheel.
- Dad, I bet you can't do that.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:37.085
- Daddy...
- But I was missing my family

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.882
Really missing them, something awful.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.644
...a perfect cartwheel.
Dad, have you ever...

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.340
It sounds crazy,
but I recorded a bunch of actresses

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.500
doing a little jibber-jabber,
to remind me of home.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.967
- I can do somersaults.
- Hey, Joe Dirt, watch my cartwheel.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.163
Wait, no, not Joe Dirt.
Daddy, watch my cartwheel!

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.006
Dad, look, I can do a back handspring!
Can you do a flip, too?

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.441
So anyways, that's the whole story.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.126
I know you believe me, 'cause all those races
I predicted and stuff came true.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.768
Anyway, Clem. I know the future,
and I know something about you,

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.609
and I know something about your wife.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.260
We must not know.
We're not supposed to know

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.567
the future that is laid out for us.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.282
Because choices must remain
for us to make.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.020
That's how it must be.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.940
What, are you saying that if you could learn
what's gonna happen in the future,

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.201
you don't even want to know?

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.484
Each day must remain without horizon.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.130
We save it for the now.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:35.700
Okay, yeah. I know what you're saying.
That you never know how hot it is

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.860
until you lose your shade tree.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.203
No. I speak with more elegance
than that.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:46.162
I'm not talking trifles from a calendar
or a bumper sticker or a poster of that cat.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.580
You've seen it. It's everywhere.

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:52.368
A cat hangs upside down from a tree.
Underneath the cat it says, "Hang in there."

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.260
- Right.
- This is nonsense.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.780
The cat must not just hang there.
The cat must go fix its problems.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.168
The cat must find the thing
that gives it trouble

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.285
and smack that thing
in the side of the head with a brick.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:08.363
The cat must ask, "Does your mother sew?

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.450
"Get her to stitch that."

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.049
- You see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, cats are hard to train. I know.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:21.084
But, Clem, I mean, Mr. Bennedetti...

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:24.540
You've convinced me that we are
friends in the future. Call me Clem.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.845
Man.

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:30.020
I love it. Well, Clem, you just turned
my life around, man. You made me rich.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.121
Me, too!

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.819
- Yeah.
- This is like a crazy accident, I saw you.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.340
Because now I'm gonna be able to
buy my kids so much stuff.

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:41.090
I'm gonna be so important to them now.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.245
Joe, I think, you've not learned all
the things you need to know from me,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.100
but, for now, there's something more
important that bothers me.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.201
Concerns me.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.620
- This girl you talk about, this Brandy?
- Yeah.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.688
Something nags me
in the back of my head.

01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:58.011
What if you miss

01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:59.801
the first time you meet her?

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.720
Everything's gonna be off.

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:04.403
The future's gonna be bat-shit crazy.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.844
That's so true. That's so smart.
I didn't think of that.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.571
Clem, I need to make it back to where
I first met Brandy.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.366
To make everything happen.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.929
That's when her dog's balls
got stuck on her porch.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.009
He was licking his balls,
and it was 40 below zero outside.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.765
- What do you expect?
- Yeah.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.481
Joe, let's have one for the road.

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:34.081
I don't even know if I should have a drink
because I got my liver taken out.

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:37.488
- Who gives a shit? Okay.
- Yeah. Okay. Let's do it.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.563
No kidney, no problem.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.809
That's right. Let's do it.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.761
Yeah.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.765
Daddy, where are you?

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.641
Man.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:03.921
You're awake.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.740
- Not feeling good, I bet, huh?
- No.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:10.890
I think I was drunk. 'Cause, you know,
I had some of my innards harvested.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.284
Yeah. That would explain the empty spots
on the X-ray.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.260
But drunk is an understatement.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:19.443
They found you running naked with
a Roman candle sticking out of your ass.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.460
You tried to eat a bunch of pigeons,

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.927
then you climbed onstage at
a Donnie Osmond concert,

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.520
screaming, "What did y'all
do with Van Halen?"

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:31.487
And then this huge guy punched you
incredibly hard directly in your testicles.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.841
Check this out.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.967
You're gonna love this.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.041
That's me!

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.131
Your balls are basically like, "Hey, man,
let's go see what his throat is talking about!"

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.660
There was a tour bus that was driving by.
There was a bunch of Japanese,

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:50.366
and you know how those people
are with their cameras.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.580
My wife is Asian!

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.889
What's up with the jokes? Like, what are you,
like some grand wizard or something?

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.806
- No, man, I didn't say nothing.
- You nodded.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.060
You nodded like a motherfucker.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:06.803
Anyway, the punch was so masterful
that your testicles are up way inside you

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.844
and they would have gone a lot higher
had they not bounced off your heart.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.620
Wait, my ball sack's where?

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:13.960
Your balls are in your stomach

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.402
and your sacks are literally
being digested as we speak.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.980
And that's not fantastic, so what we're gonna
have to do is yank them out.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.163
- You mean, gently extract?
- Yes.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.363
By extract we mean yank.

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:32.820
And so, we have these things that look like
salad tongs. Actually they are salad tongs

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.570
from the Sizzler salad bar.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:37.690
You know, there's always some good pussy
at Sizzler.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:42.250
Sizzler, yeah. I'm usually buried in
cornbread. I don't look up.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.604
I usually say this may hurt a bit,
but this is definitely gonna hurt.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.486
All right, are you ready? Let's breathe.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:50.841
Whoa, is there a parakeet!

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.441
In here?

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.403
Damn, man, why are you yelling?
Why did you yell in my ear?

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.643
Well it hurt, like a mofo!

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.380
Yeah, but what about my ear?

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:05.324
You could've turned your face that way.
You could've screamed at that wall.

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.086
But you wanted to yell in my... Whoa!

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.361
- Whoa, what?
- Whoa.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.721
Whoa, good news?

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.646
You can say that I definitely
extracted your balls.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.811
A lot of credit goes to
the workout regimen I've been on.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.380
They're hanging a little low, man.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.925
They do hang, but how low?

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.121
Remember Clackers?

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.580
Clackers, that's my balls.
That's too far.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.820
Don't worry, balls have a great
healing mechanism.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:31.921
You'll be back May, June.

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.804
Wait, May or June? I've got to go
to Silvertown by tomorrow!

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:39.540
You shouldn't do that.
You shouldn't travel.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.530
See, your balls look like tube socks
with lemons in them.

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:46.242
And that's usually the side effect from
the yankotomy I performed.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.843
But if I don't go to Silvertown,
I don't meet Brandy,

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.089
and my whole future is thrown off.
Do you understand? I gotta go!

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:54.681
Okay.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.020
Good evening, folks,

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:15.220
we'll be starting our descent into Spokane,
Washington, in a few minutes.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:20.645
So, if anyone needs to use the restroom,
please do so now.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.410
Good idea.
I'm gonna take a pee real quick.

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.325
Turbulence, everybody.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.410
Give me a second.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.281
Are those your balls?

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.047
Yeah. Is that an apple?

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.201
Turbulentay.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.324
Dang, too much turb.
Gotta sit down and pee like a little girl.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:58.806
My nuts!

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.966
My balls!

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.091
- Sir, are you okay in there?
- No, look!

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:09.364
- My nuts got sucked in, look!
- Oh, my God!

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:14.242
- What'd you do that for? That's so stupid.
- I'm not on trial here. I did an accident.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.721
What's going on?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.889
- Oh, good, sweet, Lord God.
- I need help.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.300
This man has gotten his ball sack stuck
down the toilet.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.740
I just got sucked. It's an accident.
I pushed the thing.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.890
- I'm sorry. I quit. I hate balls to start off with.
- No, no, no.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.326
- No, I'm...
- Don't quit, I need help!

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.100
You are helping me out with this.
I don't know what to do.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.020
They didn't deal with this in
stewardess school.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.168
Sir, you've got to lift them up
when I flush. Okay?

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.327
That doesn't sound like it's gonna work.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.441
- One, two, three.
- No, no, no!

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.540
It didn't work! It didn't work.

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.060
Well, we're gonna try it again. I'm gonna
try it again. One, two, three.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.161
No, no, no!

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.561
You bitch!

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.687
What're you doing? I'm sorry.
Don't do it! I never say the "B" word.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:53.931
But it hurts too much. You can't do that.
We need to think of a new strategy.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.881
- What is going on out here, ladies?
- Have a look.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:01.529
- What is... What the... Whoa! Whoa!
- Yeah.

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.088
I'm gonna get you guys some help.
Let's clean that up.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.820
You want me to clean this up first
or get the guy's balls out of the toilet?

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.900
- Watch your face, sir. It's coming in!
- Get out of here with your foot!

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.700
I'm gonna get you back to your seat,
you gotta get your nuts up out of that...

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.086
Don't kick me, Jackie Chan!

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.610
- I passed out for a minute.
- Right.

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.729
Not again, you bitch!

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:40.047
Do you really have to parade me
across the tarmac?

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.964
Is there not a shortcut?

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.169
I'm out here on display.

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:45.881
Hey, gals.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.530
I'm usually in a Hemi.

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.810
Man. Is there a second gear on this?

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.885
You see what that is, right? You see it?

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.841
- This is crazy.
- His left nut is right in that one gear.

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:01.289
Right there in the gear box.
And his other one, his other nut...

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.482
- Where'd you take off from? Miami?
- Miami.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.500
- His other nut's probably back in Miami.
- Where?

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.780
- They might have to ship it to you, buddy.
- Are you funning me?

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:11.180
Just hand me pliers and,
what do you think about a saw?

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.380
A saw? Wait, like a hacksaw?

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:17.060
Like to hack it off? No, no.
No saw by my balls. Thanks.

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:20.060
- Hey, buddy, can you let us concentrate?
- How long's this gonna take?

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:22.100
Like four or five hours.
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.204
Four or five hours? No way, man.
I gotta take an airplane to Idaho.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.846
I gotta be honest, man,
planes are out of the question.

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:31.044
- You're gonna have to drive.
- Drive? I can't drive with these balls.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.250
Plus I drive Mopar,
not some crummy rental car.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:36.961
So I rented a car.

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:41.286
And now I was heading home,
but of course I ran out of gas. Typical.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.567
Everyone saw that coming.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.540
And then I hopped a train,

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.007
and that was fun, 'cause the guy
even let me drive it for a second.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.371
Well, I screwed that up fast.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.250
I didn't stick around to fill out no
paperwork, I just started running.

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.045
I'm actually a good runner.

01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.481
I'm actually not.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.567
Man.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.201
If it isn't dirty Joe Dirt.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.251
Man. Hey, Foggle.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.329
Phonebook's looking a little
thinner these days.

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.140
How 'bout you give us them boots.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.449
And we'll kill you only half as slow
as we was gonna.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.406
How did you find me, man?

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:34.121
I met you back in 1965.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.980
Joe Dirt, we're the dream
you can't slip.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.846
The ache in your heart.
The darkness just outside of your light.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.940
We've been hounding you since the day
you was left behind like garbage

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.485
by your ma and pa.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:51.928
We're an allegory and a reality,
and your time is up.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.204
This is gonna be good.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.441
Hey.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.564
I don't like your tone.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.208
You're talking to my boy all wrong.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:06.601
Clem!

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.841
Who are you?

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:16.569
I've come to check on my boy, Joe Dirt.
He's my goose that lays the golden eggs.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:19.763
You don't mess with my goose,
unless you're a gander.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.848
- Tell me, are you a gander?
- No!

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.650
No, I'm not a gander!

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.260
Clem, I'm so glad to see you, man.
But I gotta get out of here.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.930
I've got to get
to Brandy's house right now!

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.969
I want those boots, pissant!

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.963
Joe, go meet your woman.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.602
I will take care of these dunskies.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.980
You know, we're kind of running
the show here.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.780
We've got our chains and knives.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.530
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.049
Especially if I've got the guns.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.481
Not now, darling.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.243
Hey, Clem,
you don't have to do this for me, buddy.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:54.140
Joe Dirt, we may meet again someday.

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.220
I don't know.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.210
But for that to happen,
you must meet your destiny.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.084
You've learned how hot it is
when you lose your shade tree.

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.490
Go get your shade tree back.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:05.921
Thanks, man.

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.170
Hey, by the way, why doesn't it sound
fruity when you say that?

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.482
You don't have time for the explanation.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:15.321
- I don't. Bye, Foggle. I gotta go.
- Joe Dirt.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.521
Joe Dirt!

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.201
And you.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.169
You're done with Joe Dirt.
You must never haunt his dreams again.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.887
You must never be that voice of doubt
that makes him think he's not good.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.728
Your dance with Joe Dirt is done.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.240
I'll let you know when it's over.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:40.689
Hey, does your mother sew?

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.561
Get her to stitch that!

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.521
Charlie!

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.209
We've got to get you unstuck.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.048
Is there anybody out there
that will help me?

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.401
It's you!

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.540
Yeah.

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.860
Thank goodness.
We've gotta help Charlie.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.247
I was born to help Charlie.
What's going on?

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.300
I was thinking maybe
warm water and a spatula?

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:34.811
- That's a great idea.
- Okay.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.329
Man, keep your mouth shut, mutt.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.606
All right. I'm looking at you, too.
He's all good. Come on back.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.441
Charlie!

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.769
- Jimmy, thank you!
- You're welcome.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.020
- It ain't nothing.
- How did you do that?

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:53.930
Don't worry about it.
That's a guy thing, right there.

01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.844
Brandy, hey.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.807
I'm sorry, do I know you?

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.441
It's me, Brandy, Joe Dirt.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:04.921
Joe Dirt?

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.281
What kind of name is that?

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:11.044
It's me. We're supposed to meet here,
right now. Right exactly now, with Charlie.

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:15.088
We become friends,
and eventually we get married.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.964
Boy, what are you talking about?

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.611
Is you wasted or something?

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.566
Mr. Dirt, I can't talk right now.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.243
- Jimmy and I need to tend to my dog.
- Brandy, I'm rich now.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.200
I'm super rich.

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.485
I'm somebody that's worth loving.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:34.321
Mr. Dirt, money doesn't interest me
all that much.

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:38.004
I'm more interested in a man
that is kind.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:42.001
Like somebody that would
help a dog in distress.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:47.060
Well, hell, just yesterday, I saved 15
raccoons by giving them mouth-to-mouth

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.208
'cause they was choking
on garbage and stuff.

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.845
Heck, I'll save anybody.

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.371
Especially you, Brandy.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:55.967
You know, 'cause I am armed!

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.242
A-R-M-D right there.

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.321
Well,

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:02.090
it was nice meeting you, Mr. Dirt.

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.641
Yeah, later, Dirt.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:11.688
- Jimmy, would you like some ice cream?
- Why, hells to the yes. Get on in there!

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.201
And that was it.

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.041
I missed my destiny.

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.121
Just like that it was all gone.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.884
I'm sorry, Joe. I really am.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.940
Thanks for listening. I appreciate it.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.611
Right now you're probably
the only friend I have.

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.810
There's my bus!

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.841
See ya!

01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.201
Wow, where's the fire, lady?

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:05.088
He got kicked to the curb!

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.521
Joe Dirt fucked up a couple things.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.321
Damn, she just left him.

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.843
That boy was left with nothing.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:19.571
But, you know, last time
all he had was his freedom.

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:20.841
And you know what freedom is.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.020
Yeah.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:26.250
Just another word
for nothing left to lose.

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.611
Look at you all growed up
and being Starsky and Putz!

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.444
I had a cousin named Randy.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:41.601
Yeah.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:46.891
But much like Ned Beatty braced against
the shale wall in Deliverance,

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.011
this time he's got shit tons to lose.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:55.687
But, come on, it's Joe Dirt. There's always
one more ace up his wife-beater.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.086
Let's pick this story back up.

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.125
Get out of the road!

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.241
What's up?

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.642
Hey, dude. Where'd you come from?
You scared the crap out of me.

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.280
Looks like you've just
completely given up, huh, Joe?

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.609
Look out...
Man, that car just drove through you!

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.725
Like a car driving through you.
Are you some sort of ghost or something?

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:28.127
Ghost-like. Yeah, check this out.
Put your hand right here. Just touch it.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.211
No, that's your private parts, man.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.620
Private, but you're invited.
Go ahead. Put it right there.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:36.500
It'll go right through me. I won't even
feel it. I won't even feel it. Go ahead.

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:39.331
- Really? All right, I ain't being fruity.
- Yeah. All right.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.966
It did!

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:46.660
- That felt nice.
- No man, don't say that. That's wrong.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:49.366
You could've bought me dinner first.
We just met.

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:51.940
You talk slow, but you move fast.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.884
Yeah, it's like there's a dog whistle
in my pants and only you can hear it.

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.300
Do it again, one more time, I wanna see if
you can get me off again.

01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:00.006
No, I didn't get you off, man,
I ain't no party boy.

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:03.420
Come on, Joe. I'm just messing with you.
I was trying to lighten the mood.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.740
I never figured you for a quitter.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.367
Weren't you the guy who once said,
"Life's a garden, dig it?"

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:14.564
Yeah, I also said, "Say it, don't spray it."
But that Joe's gone, man.

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.406
"Life's a garden, dig it,"
ain't nothing but a bumper sticker.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.042
Well, don't you think that sometimes bumper
stickers have a little bit of truth in them?

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:26.087
Yeah, you know the one that says, "Wrap it in
latex, or she'll get your paychecks."

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.362
- That one's got lots of truth. Yeah.
- Sure.

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:32.201
Sure, and then I remember
that one that said "Coexist."

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.050
Yeah, that's not as funny.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:39.320
And then they took the coexist
and they changed it to "Joe-exist"

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.500
to put his hands on dick.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.940
Come on, Joe. I want you to come with me.
I want to show you something.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.201
I wanna take you to Silvertown.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:50.248
Silvertown? No way, man. That place is
1,000 miles away. Literally and finger...

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.007
And fig...

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.403
Fig Newtonally.

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.420
Were you going for "Figuratively"?

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.620
'Cause I know that you were
just going for some

01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:59.722
homo action in my pants
just a minute ago.

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:02.367
Joe, when you're with me Silvertown
is just a second away.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.281
All right.

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.041
Wait a second, is this Silvertown?

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:16.002
Man, it's all gone to hell.
What happened?

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:19.364
You didn't happen, Joe.
It all went to hell.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:25.085
Although, my guess is you would have
rather had it go to the Thunder Down Under.

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.700
The Thunder Down Under show?
That's a bunch of dudes dancing around.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.007
Why do you keep saying crap like that?

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.129
You couldn't wait
to get your hand on my dick.

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.971
And I get it, you know, we all want
what we can't have.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.807
You want to touch what's on
the other side of the light,

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:41.020
and the closest thing
to you was my dick.

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:43.140
But you wanted to wear it
like a fucking wristwatch,

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.368
which would be great, right?
Then you could say,

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.969
"What time is it?
It's 15 minutes to dick."

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.761
Snapper, 11 o'clock.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.201
Nine o'clock.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.721
Snapper.

01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:59.568
I'd drink a gallon of her piss
just to see where it came from.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.484
That's nice. Yeah, yeah.

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.980
I've got Brandy, she's my girl,
and I don't...

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.260
But I guess, what they say you know,

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.931
"You're on a diet
don't mean you can't look at the menu."

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:11.700
Right?

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:14.300
Just because you're petting the dog
don't mean you can't have sex with it.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:15.890
- Right?
- I don't know.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.686
You're creeping me out.
You're so creepy. You're so creepy.

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.580
My dick had you at hello and now you're

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.780
talking about having sex
with animals and shit.

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.060
I don't get you.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.860
No, dude.
Okay, you're twisting things around.

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.088
I just said Silvertown
looks way different,

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:33.807
but I didn't say sex with animals,
that don't turn me on, man, that's...

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.164
That's weird stuff, I mean...

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.445
Maybe Jessica Rabbit...

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:44.060
It's not called Silvertown anymore.
Jimmy Yauch bought this joint,

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.060
changed its name to Jimmy Town.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.580
What...

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.842
What? Dude, why would he do that?

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.966
Well, he got rich, Joe.
He got rich as hell.

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:57.940
But all he does anymore is sit around
and pop Molly cut with ketamine and shit.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.260
Trip his balls off.

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:02.140
Joe, about what happened back there,
you know when you fisted me?

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.368
I don't want things to get weird
between the two of us.

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:07.530
But if I could just be serious for
a second, "What do balls taste like?"

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.060
You know, did you go to
guardian angel school?

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.527
Because I feel like
maybe you flunked out.

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.449
Hey! Hey, you little punks!

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.000
Come back here!

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.888
Third time this week kids
have ripped me off.

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:24.140
This used to be a town for families,
community.

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:25.300
Yeah.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.970
I don't know, the last few decades,

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:30.882
hell, something's gone missing. It's like...
Well, it's like the glue is gone.

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:33.580
Someone stole Silvertown's glue?

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.780
Wait, is that one of them metaphors
you talked about?

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:40.020
- Who are you talking to?
- Oh, sorry, man. This here is Clair.

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:41.121
He can't see me, Joe.

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:45.761
For Christ's sake,
kids ripping off comic books,

01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:49.930
assholes standing around talking to
themselves. It's all just bullshit!

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:54.881
Man.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:59.202
Joe? Brandy's just outside of town.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:01.447
Brandy lives here?

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.329
This don't seem like her kind
of place at all.

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.488
Well, these days this is
her kind of place.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.367
Her life went down a different path
on the day that she didn't meet you.

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:14.420
She's changed. I mean, she is still cute
as a little puppy.

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:18.260
If that little puppy had great tits
and a nice ass.

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:19.340
Man...

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.206
It's like diarrhea, I can't stop.
You should see for yourself, though.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.860
Hey, man, how did you do that?

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:32.124
Well, because I'm an angel, you moron!

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:42.282
- Joe, I want you to find Brandy.
- Okay.

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:56.722
You hear that? It's poetry.

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:57.820
Poetry?

01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:02.060
Brandy finally gave me the gift
I knew she always had to give.

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.083
All the great words.

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.606
The great magical turns of a phrase.

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:11.481
That lives within me now
and informs my music.

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:14.844
It's all because of her.
So you know what I'm thinking?

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.700
You all want to get wasted?

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.006
- Yeah!
- Get real wasted, real fast!

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:20.140
- Yeah!
- Party like a rock star?

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.260
Well, all right!

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.900
Yeah!

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.923
Here's what I'm thinking, tampons!

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:28.100
Come on, man, hear me out, man.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:31.647
You soak them in vodka, and then
we shove them straight up our asses.

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:35.260
Wait, what?

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.044
No, no, it will get you
hammered ASAP, man.

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:38.740
Mark McGrath does it every night.

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.729
I don't know.
That seems weird, a little.

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:42.683
Do you guys question the iPhone?

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:45.688
Well, yeah, but this seems different
than an iPhone.

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:48.100
You can't compare an iPhone
with a tampon.

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:52.940
Stop being such a bunch of pussies now!
I demand you to stop being pussies.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:56.886
Now start to soaking and get to shoving!

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.340
Or you're out of my entourage!
All of youse!

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.660
Keep soaking and shoving.
Soak and shove.

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.762
- I want to hear you boys say it now.
- Soak and shove.

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.087
You better be right about that.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.931
- All right.
- Oh, yeah.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.660
It's hard to get in there, boss.

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:13.003
Don't worry about it, man. Just keep
shoving, it will get there. It will get there.

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:18.566
How are you doing, Cal?

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:21.405
Eight, nine, 10...

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:26.760
Oh, yeah, 14! These things
are going up, like, easy-peasy.

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.607
- What?
- Fourteen?

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.968
What do you say? What? Who said that?

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:41.322
What are you saying?
I thought I was eating them?

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.820
- I thought you said eat them?
- He wasn't eating them, man.

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:46.140
You said eat them. I had, like, 14.

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.220
I was eating them.
They taste like cotton candy.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.641
Wait a minute, did you say butt, man?

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:54.340
Oh, my God, Jimmy.
He was putting them up his butt.

01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:57.603
This guy! This guy was putting them
up his butt.

01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:59.928
What an idiot! What an idiot!

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.820
They all went up your butt, Cal.
I seen them all go up your butt.

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:07.180
No. No! This sucks!

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:10.443
No! I'm done with this party!
You suck, Jimmy!

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:14.127
No, you don't suck. You're great, man.
I love you. You're awesome. You're the best.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.100
You're the best. He sucks!

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.601
No, I'm out. This is terrible.

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.609
- Dude, stay! Stay! Stay! Hey!
- Jimmy, this is stupid.

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:22.922
No, Jimmy. What a dumb idea!

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.380
Jimmy, we got a situation out here.

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.687
Come on, man.
We're doing a science experiment here.

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:30.008
Yeah, but there's this guy out here.

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:31.860
What's up?

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:34.380
Look, man. We caught this dude
without an invitation.

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:35.845
You want me to throw his ass out?

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:39.020
- I know you, right?
- You know me, yeah!

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.620
It's Joe Dirt. Jimmy, I can't believe
you're such a huge star.

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:43.960
This big house, man.

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.220
It seems like just yesterday we was
hanging out at the gas station...

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.484
Now, hold up a second. I ain't never
hung out with nobody named Joe Dirt.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.643
And I ain't about to start right now.

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.281
Oh, yeah.

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.886
You know,
I think I confused you for somebody.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.140
Yeah, I think you did.

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:04.767
Hey, get this boy a drink.
Maybe clear his head up a little bit.

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:07.008
- Nah, man, I'm cool.
- No, you ain't.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.843
Dang, I walk into that every time.

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:12.288
Hey, is Brandy around?

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.169
- What did you say?
- Is Brandy here?

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:16.169
Oh, you asking about Brandy now?

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:19.682
You coming up in my house,
actin' all buddy-buddy like,

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:21.285
and now you're hitting on my wife?

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:22.460
No, I didn't mean...

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.131
Your wife? Brandy's not your...

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.890
- Yeah.
- What?

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:32.884
Oh, my God! When you took my place on the
porch, saving Charlie's balls, that's right.

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:34.420
Wait a minute.

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:37.900
You're that dude that walked up
on me and Brandy that night on the porch

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.420
when I was saving that stupid mutt,
or something like that.

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.020
And you was talking about,
"Oh, Brandy, I love you.

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:46.980
"I got so much money
it's coming out of my butt."

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:49.260
It's no wonder Colt Ford
wrote a song about you.

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:51.060
Colt Ford wrote a song about me?

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.083
Yeah, man. The Ballad of Joe Dirt.

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:56.724
And here you are, stupid mullet,

01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:00.563
stupid face and all of that.

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:05.082
Hello, ladies!

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.248
Lookey here, lookey here!

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:12.081
Hey, Jimmy, ain't you just say
you married to Brandy now?

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:18.601
She does her thing, I do my thing.
That's the way that thing goes.

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.369
How you doing?
Where are your friends at?

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:24.245
Have you seen the Jacuzzi yet?
You're going to love it.

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:25.980
Come on now. You got a twin sister?

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.206
Not cool.

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:32.881
Hey!

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:34.887
Brandy!

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:39.083
- How do I light this?
- This way, babe.

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:40.921
You do it.

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.330
This way, silly.

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:45.441
Brandy?

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.601
Hey!

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.890
Hey! I remember you.

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:54.260
You're that rich guy.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.700
You were going to help me with Charlie
when he was stuck.

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.900
- Yeah.
- Until Jimmy beat you to it,

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.490
and helped me instead.

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.445
Might have been the last time
Jimmy helped me with anything.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:08.489
Look, it's the moron with
the Tennessee top hat.

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.405
Tennessee top hat.

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.971
That's actually a good one, fellas.
I had not heard that one before.

01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:16.970
- They've got some new stuff.
- Oh, yeah?

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:19.890
I bet you never heard
that you're a winner, either!

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:22.531
Jimmy would have liked that one!

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:24.081
I love Jimmy!

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.606
Where is Jimmy?

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.649
Forget about Jimmy, baby.

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.965
- You're with me now.
- Katrina, you're so sweet.

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.811
- You're such a good friend to me.
- Oh, yeah.

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.531
You look so hot tonight, Brandy.

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.846
- Doesn't she look hot, boys?
- Yeah!

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.248
I don't think she looks that hot.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:46.650
I mean, she's gorgeous,

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.660
but that's not the Brandy I'm used to.
You don't look like that.

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:52.001
I mean, you look slutty hot,
and that's good.

01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:54.925
Slutty hot is good,
it's just not the regular hot.

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.521
But believe me, there's a place
for slutty hot, guys like that.

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.883
But Brandy isn't that kind of hot,
you're innocent, sweet hot.

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:04.647
I mean, sluts are great. You know what?
I'm digging a hole. I can get out of it.

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:07.407
Brandy, what's been happening
in Silvertown?

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.408
Brandy's been happening.

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:20.602
Oh, boy, I didn't think those
M's was ever going to stop.

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:23.008
This girl's got more M's than M&M's.

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.841
'Cause M&M's...

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.685
No laughs. Absolutely zero.

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.370
When Jimmy's here you
laugh at everything...

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.020
He cuts a fart,
everyone cracks up for two hours.

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:34.044
This town is called Jimmy Town now.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:38.521
My husband renamed it.
I kind of miss the old name.

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.245
And all that came with it.

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:43.686
Brandy?

01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:47.407
I'd like to be all that came
with it to you.

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.364
Katrina, that tickles.

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:53.849
Jimmy will get mad. He always gets mad.

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:57.802
No, he'll just grab a camera
and pop a rod.

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:00.402
You're just a lost little girl, Brandy.

01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:02.444
I didn't used to be.

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.163
I used to be a strong,
independent woman.

01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.603
I don't know what happened to me.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.367
- It could be the heroin.
- Heroin, man?

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:14.241
What's going on in this town?
It's all mixed up.

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:17.380
I don't know what is and isn't
mixed up anymore.

01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.100
You're so deep, Brandy.

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.601
You like when I do this to you,
don't you?

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:25.767
I bet you're wearing those silk little
panties I bought for you, ain't you?

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:29.100
Don't say ain't
or your mother will faint.

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:33.000
- Your father will fall into a bucket of paint.
- Your father will fall into a bucket of paint.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.170
Wow. You and me.

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:40.020
We have a connection, Joe Dirt.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.281
We used to always say that.

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:45.286
I say it all the time to our kids...
To my kids.

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:49.523
Kiss me, Brandy. Like you mean it, girl.

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:53.243
Don't be halfway
with me no more, Brandy.

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.967
Okay, that's it. Show's over, everybody.
Stop it right there, that's enough.

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:58.620
- What are you doing?
- What the hell?

01:37:58.720 --> 01:37:59.801
What are you, queer?

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:04.127
Brandy, in another life we get married,
we fall in love.

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:07.403
We have three beautiful kids,
Cheyenne, Abilene and Dakota.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.260
Those are such sweet names.

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:11.740
Well, that's because you picked them.

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:13.330
- I picked dumb names.
- Stay on topic, Joe.

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:16.860
Man, you scare me because you
come out of nowhere sometimes.

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.540
Tell her. Tell her what you've learned.

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:21.483
- Tell her how you feel now.
- Okay.

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:22.761
I think I got it.

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:24.300
- Who's he talking to?
- I don't know.

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:27.006
All right, Brandy.
Me and you was together.

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:29.380
And everything was going great,
and we was really happy.

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:32.540
And then something terrible happened,
and I got taken away from you and the kids,

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:36.565
and then now,
I think I'm sent back to learn a lesson

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.691
- that if I have money...
- What the hell!

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:43.850
Come on! Damn it, Joe,
you still don't get it?

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:47.980
Look, they told me you were dumb,
but it's almost like you're an

01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:50.560
"I'm joking" kind of dumb.
Look, I give up here.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.420
I guess I'm not going to get my wings

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:55.046
and I'm never going to hear
that beautiful sound.

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:56.860
What sound?

01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:00.420
Well, you hear a certain kind of clang
when an angel gets its wings. Whatever.

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.540
- I, look...
- Oh, wait.

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.167
When an angel gets its wings? That's from
a movie or something, like a TV show?

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:07.805
Shut up, dude!

01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.647
You're seriously bumming out the vibe
in this room.

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:14.089
Brandy here had a monsoon in her panties,
thinking about me.

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:17.300
And then you walk in here not remembering
lines from It's a Wonderful Life.

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:18.420
That's it.

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:21.410
I'm trying to get down,
and you're getting me down.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:27.011
Look, this is just too confusing.

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:28.366
I've had too much to drink.

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:30.400
I got to go.

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.205
- I got to go.
- Let me... Can I talk...

01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.441
What did you do?

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:42.140
Brandy, I think I know
what I'm supposed to know now.

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.401
I'm going to be different!

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.403
I don't know what you're saying,
just please stop.

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:47.565
I'm married to Jimmy.

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.566
But he doesn't feel like
he's married to me.

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.529
My life feels like it is spinning
out of control.

01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:58.251
Goodbye, Joe Dirt.

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:04.451
Well, that went great.

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:09.089
I don't know what's going on anymore, man.
I don't know what I'm supposed to learn.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:10.766
Well, you're not very bright.

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:13.242
Come on, I ain't no toaster scientist.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.601
What am I supposed to learn?
I bench 150 on a good day.

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.930
The fact that I'm supposed to memorize
a spark-plug gap

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:20.969
on a Plymouth 383?

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.649
I don't know.
I just want my old life back.

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:24.921
150's not that great.

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.891
Hey, Clair.

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:30.500
Hey, wait, you're that woman that yelled
at me on the bus bench.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.602
That's right. You fart-eater.

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:37.249
I'm the good witch. I'm the one
that sent this hunky angel to you.

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.980
- No offence, Clair.
- No offence? Really? Okay.

01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:44.165
He's like that angel that saved that
cracker-ass Jimmy Stewart.

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.601
And helped that white, racist-ass town.

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.810
Tell me something, how come they don't
ever have any angels to save a black town?

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.526
You don't think black towns could
use some help once in a while?

01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:57.327
You ever seen Detroit?
That town is sucking some misery dick.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:01.366
How come them bitches in Hollywood
don't throw us a bone every once in a while?

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.325
Wait a second, you're the good witch?

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:07.540
Well, maybe you should
work on your, like, presentation,

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.608
because it comes off a little
rough around the edges.

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.645
But I have to say, ma'am,
with all due respect,

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:14.003
this is who I am. I'm Joe Dirt.

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.970
Okay? And I'm fine with it.

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:18.122
I'm not mean to other people
like you are.

01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:21.011
In fact, I made some money
with this guy, Clem,

01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:23.163
and if you need it
for that city, Detroit,

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.961
then you could have it all to help them.
I don't care.

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:30.060
Because I thought it was about being rich,
and showing my family I had a lot of money,

01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:32.162
and being famous like Lynyrd Skynyrd,

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.047
but that don't matter.

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.162
It's about me being me. Just me.

01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.006
And I'm okay with that.

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.121
And they're okay with that.

01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:47.923
- Well I'll be dipped in shit.
- Holy hell, he gets it.

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:49.726
What? What happened?

01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:51.326
You got it, Joe Dirt.

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:54.211
- You learned your lesson.
- Yeah, you're going home, Joe.

01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:56.205
You're going home. You know...

01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:59.408
I was Foggle, did you know that?

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:03.020
You was Foggle?
Wait, you're both sort of, like, homophobic.

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:04.100
Maybe, yeah, I see it.

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:06.726
Well, I was acting,
and I made some interesting choices.

01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.340
Well, a little big at first,

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.620
but I thought I reeled him in.
I had to be convincing.

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:13.326
- Those guy would have raped me...
- Oh, fuck that acting shit!

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:14.885
This boy's going home.

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:18.380
Click those boots together, Joe Dirt,
you know what to say.

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:20.244
I just say,
"There ain't no place like home"?

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.562
Joe, I want to thank you
for giving my wings.

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.406
You got your wings?

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.891
I did. Well, I'm going to get them now.

01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:28.403
- Am I supposed to hear a clang?
- You will.

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.300
Daddy...

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:35.460
You're the most handsomest man
that I have ever seen.

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.881
Your dance with Joe Dirt is done.

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:39.925
Life's a garden, dig it.

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:41.100
When are you coming back?

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.540
- Home is where you make it.
- You like to see homos naked?

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.042
No, no, no, no.
Home is where you make it.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.526
Ain't nothing like home.
Ain't nothing like home.

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.410
Joe! Wake up!

01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:56.601
- Joe?
- Brandy!

01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:58.926
Is this a dream?

01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:00.241
Is this a dream again?

01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:03.160
No, it's real! Get over here. Come on!

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:05.011
Where have you guys been?

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.606
I missed you! Look at you, huh?

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.288
- Hey!
- Hey, baby.

01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:19.322
- I think it's good.
- Oh, my God!

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.201
- I know, I gotta get 'em.
- Get his stick!

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.200
Come on, you little hicks.

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:30.820
So that is the whole story, it's crazy.

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:33.366
Joe, we love you just the way you are.

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:35.165
We do, Daddy!

01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:36.367
We love you!

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:40.180
We wouldn't trade you for any other Daddy
in the whole wide world.

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:42.660
Did you practice that?
It sounds too good.

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:43.740
No.

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.285
Hold up, hold up.

01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:48.203
Wait a second, this looks familiar.

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.641
What's wrong?

01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:51.250
There's no way.

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:54.166
That was all a dream.
It doesn't matter, never mind.

01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.041
What is it, Daddy?

01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:57.486
It...

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:20.328
Babe, we're rich.

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:24.203
Rich? Why, you've always
been rich, Joe Dirt.

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:27.320
You just needed
to find that out for yourself.

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:33.602
Daddy and Mommy!

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.321
That's right!

01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:38.523
Mommy likes me. Come on, let's go.

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:40.480
Come on, babies.

01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:12.220
He's got a backhoe
it's Caterpillar yellow

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:15.540
He's a Heller of a feller
a drinking storyteller, with a DUI

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:17.140
He's illegal to drive

01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:19.891
But he legally drinks
and gets illegally high

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:25.088
One night, while he's up in the sky
he looked at that backhoe, asked himself

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:26.361
"Why not?"

01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.849
I'm going to drive that thing
It's a loophole, man, the DUI don't pertain

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:35.045
I'm only driving to the bar
down on Main Street

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.140
Now he's digging

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:40.940
Got a hot little honey
hanging out of that cab

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:43.060
Just digging

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:46.243
Got the windows tinted
and a bass tune hitting

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.885
Digging!

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:51.580
Creeping past the Po-Po, incognito

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:54.331
Like Joe Dirt, that's how he's living

01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:57.603
Life's a garden, man
and he's just digging

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:09.540
Wearing a cat hat with a meow-meow kitty

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.780
Rolls up in the club, pimpin' like Diddy

01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.804
With the beer tipping
Just sippin' on suds

01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:16.980
Putting shots back
and tripping with his buds

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:18.081
No, thank you.

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:23.931
Old comic books in mint condition
for 10 cents apiece.

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:25.321
Give old...

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:31.700
Well, long story short, we stomped
those three dudes so hard

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:33.689
they got to take
their boots off to piss.

01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:40.121
Anyway, this... Motherfucker!

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.180
Seriously? Seriously?

01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:45.363
- What, is it 2015?
- Oh, my God.

01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:48.929
I thought I had this turned off.
This is embarrassing.

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:53.329
Joe, I want to talk to you.

01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:59.644
I like you. You have funny hair,
but I like you.

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.330
Hey, funny guy.

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:12.525
As a matter of fact, if you want to
stay awake right now,

01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:15.260
you'll still be on the road,
in the middle of nowhere.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:16.725
Your call. REM.

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.051
That's so stupid.

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:25.681
No, thank you.

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:31.367
Man, old comic books in mint condition
for 10 cents apiece.

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:36.724
You give old Joe Dirt lemonade,
he's gonna give you... Fuck you!

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.411
One more, then I gotta go to lunch.

01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:42.300
Wait, you're twisting stuff.
Like I say something,

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:43.540
and then you say it back different.

01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:45.881
You're supposed to be
a nice guardian angel, like...

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:47.730
I don't picture people like you.

01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:50.204
- Anyway, I don't get horny by...
- Let's go.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.684
I don't get horny...
I'm gonna get it out.

01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:58.602
I don't get horny from animal sex.
But I like Jessica Rabbit.

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.044
- Really?
- She's fuckable, yeah.

01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:03.731
- I kind of get a gay vibe from you.
- Yeah, I've heard that.

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.370
Can someone open this for me?

01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:10.525
Did somebody fart on this?

01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.401
What did I do?

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:16.768
What? Those two farts were accidents.
Wait. No. What?

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.846
"Wait. No. What?"

01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:23.969
What? I have a medical condition.
They did it on purpose.

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.489
Fine. I don't even work here.

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:35.820
Stuff you actually made up to sound cool
because you were on shrooms,

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.321
but actually makes you sound
like a dipshit.

01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:39.966
So I'm gonna say no.

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:44.451
Hey, John. I'm up here at Load C.
Some asshole went diarrhea all over the seat.

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:47.286
Copy that. When can you start?

01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:53.124
- Laugh like me.
- Okay.

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:00.441
- All right.
- We're good? Okay.

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:08.282
- That's it. Cut.
- That's a cut.
