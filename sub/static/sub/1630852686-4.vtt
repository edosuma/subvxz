WEBVTT

00:15.933 --> 00:18.393
- Son, 30 is a funny age.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.312
It looks different on everyone.

00:20.312 --> 00:23.023
Some 30-year-olds
are the picture of maturity,

00:23.023 --> 00:25.567
while others are way,
way, way less grown up.

00:27.069 --> 00:28.862
I was more in the latter group.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.948
- What up, my bitches?

00:33.116 --> 00:35.827
- Honored to be
one of your bitches.

00:35.827 --> 00:38.455
- I'm not going to lie.
This dress is Nip Slip City,

00:38.455 --> 00:40.624
but I don't care. I had to level up

00:40.624 --> 00:42.501
because Drew is taking me

00:42.501 --> 00:45.546
to Bocca Partito tonight.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.548
- Bocca Partito!?

00:47.548 --> 00:50.968
Dang, Drew! That's like a "no prices
on the menu" restaurant.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.469
- Alright, I'm calling it now.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.806
You are having the best
birthday weekend ever.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.559
You are snatched and sipping
on some fancy wine

00:58.559 --> 01:00.769
with Drew tonight
to close out your 20s.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.105
And then tomorrow, you turn 30,

01:03.105 --> 01:05.899
and we will be drinking
so many 40s,

01:05.899 --> 01:07.359
you'll be hung over to your 50s.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.489
- Speaking of,
how's my party going, party planner?

01:12.489 --> 01:14.324
- I'm crushing it.
All you have to do

01:14.324 --> 01:16.827
is show up to our apartment tomorrow
night, dressed as Christina Aguilera

01:16.827 --> 01:19.204
from the Dirrty video.
Mm! Mm!

01:19.204 --> 01:20.163
- Wait, why?

01:20.163 --> 01:22.249
- Wait, did you not open my evite?

01:22.249 --> 01:24.084
That's the theme of my party.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.253
It's my favorite music video of all time.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.422
It's so... dirty!
- Dirty!

01:29.840 --> 01:31.967
- Hey, Jess, this is going
to be our first party together

01:31.967 --> 01:33.677
since my birthday at Chuck E. Cheese.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.470
- Oh yeah. You turned 5.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.514
Mom turned out to be boning Chuck.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.309
- Wait, your mum cheated on your dad
with a guy dressed as a mouse?

01:40.309 --> 01:42.936
- No, no, no. Just some random guy
from the neighborhood named Chuck.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.189
No relation to Mr. E. Cheese.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.523
And then she left our dad,

01:46.523 --> 01:48.567
married him, and moved Ellen
halfway across the country.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.820
- But, tomorrow night,
we're going to make up for lost time.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.030
- Yes, yes, we are. In fact,

01:53.030 --> 01:54.865
maybe we can even hit on
some girls together, you know?

01:54.865 --> 01:57.201
The Walker siblings on the prowl?

01:57.201 --> 01:58.952
- Exactly!

01:58.952 --> 02:01.371
Except that's not my last name.
- What?

02:01.371 --> 02:03.707
- I took Mom's last name
after the divorce, remember?

02:03.707 --> 02:06.919
- Right! The Gilbert-hyphen-Walkers
on the prowl.

02:06.919 --> 02:10.589
Siblings and wing people.
One might call us wing sibs.

02:10.589 --> 02:11.673
- Ooh! Trademark!

02:11.673 --> 02:13.634
- You can't call trademark.
I just said it.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.386
- Yeah, and you
should also have said trademark.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.305
- Hey, Jasper.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.558
How about a group shot
for Sophie?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.810
And pour yourself one, too.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.730
Like I said,
I was one kind of grown-up...

02:26.730 --> 02:28.315
ALL:
Shots! Shots! Shots!

02:28.315 --> 02:30.067
FUTURE SOPHIE:
...but Drew was another.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.276
- I was going to get a puppy,

02:31.276 --> 02:33.987
but there's so many senior dogs
who need homes.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.907
You know, as soon as I saw
Rue McClanahan's big brown eyes,

02:36.907 --> 02:38.450
I... I melted.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.744
- Wait, did you name your senior dog

02:40.744 --> 02:42.246
after one of the Golden Girls?

02:42.246 --> 02:45.082
- Oh, not just one of them. The best.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.751
Blanche hive, rise up.

02:48.919 --> 02:50.170
Uh, excuse me. Uh,

02:50.170 --> 02:53.549
can we get a bottle of
the 2016 Montepulciano, please?

02:56.218 --> 02:57.678
FUTURE SOPHIE:
He was a real adult.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.722
And I was real into it.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.352
This should be a workout. Kegfit.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.354
- Trademark!
- Damn it!

03:08.188 --> 03:11.275
- What is that hideous ring?
Are you a youth group minister?

03:11.275 --> 03:13.986
- Man-- No! This is my man-gagement ring.

03:13.986 --> 03:16.446
Trademark! Ha! Got it!

03:16.446 --> 03:17.906
- You can have it.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.993
- Whatever. Isn't this gorgeous
yet masculine?

03:20.993 --> 03:23.954
This is pewter with
real dinosaur bone inlay.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.123
- You're not getting any bone
or lay wearing that.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.375
Hannah got that for you?

03:28.375 --> 03:30.502
- No, she hates it.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.879
- Sorry, I'm late.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.506
I still can't figure out
this dang MetroCard swipes,

03:34.506 --> 03:36.425
so I walked here.
Twenty-six blocks.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.010
- Oh. Well look, the MetroCard
swipe is easy.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.220
You just gotta do it with confidence.
Zing! Like that.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.098
- Uh, no! Don't listen to him.
You got to do it slow,

03:43.098 --> 03:44.349
methodical like, uh!

03:44.349 --> 03:46.059
- You sound so stupid right now.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.145
Obviously, it's a zing! Not an, uh!

03:48.145 --> 03:49.646
- The "uh" works, man.
- No.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.566
Zing! Zing! Zing--
- Uh! Uh!

03:52.566 --> 03:53.817
- Shut the zing up!

03:56.153 --> 03:58.488
- So, tomorrow's a big night for us.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.074
Mum always says
a couple isn't a couple

04:01.074 --> 04:03.160
until they attend a soirée arm-in-arm.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.538
I was wondering,
how should I refer to you at the party?

04:06.538 --> 04:07.915
My boo?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.625
My girlfriend?

04:09.625 --> 04:10.834
Ooh! My wonderwall.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.712
- Interesting.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.297
Look, Charlie,

04:15.297 --> 04:16.548
things are going great between us,

04:16.548 --> 04:18.467
but we haven't decided
to be, like...

04:18.467 --> 04:19.718
together together.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.387
- No, I know.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.307
I guess I thought we're
at least somewhat together.

04:25.307 --> 04:28.018
You know. I did walk away
from generational wealth

04:28.018 --> 04:29.895
and move across an ocean
to be with you.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.523
- And that was so sweet of you.

04:32.523 --> 04:35.108
We definitely are somewhat together,

04:35.108 --> 04:37.694
but we're also young and fun

04:37.694 --> 04:39.613
and spontaneous.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.281
Do I go home with you tomorrow night?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.992
Maybe. Do I go home with Jeff Goldblum

04:43.992 --> 04:46.078
and his hot yoga wife again?

04:46.078 --> 04:47.704
Maybe.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.540
- Fine.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.334
So, I can just canoodle with whomever
I want, and you'll be fine with it.

04:52.334 --> 04:55.712
- Exactly. I'm so glad
you're on board. Mwah!

04:57.506 --> 04:59.091
- That's a no on girlfriend then.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.973
- You live in Queens, right?
- Mm-hmm.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.474
- 'Cause, you know,
the library in Astoria is...

05:09.059 --> 05:12.229
Yeah, you know I'm tipsy when
I start recommending libraries.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.481
One more drink,

05:14.481 --> 05:16.358
I'm going to start listing
my favorite community gardens.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.571
Um... Maybe we should call it a night.

05:20.571 --> 05:23.657
- Really? Oh my god,
I feel like we just sat down.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.576
- Me, too, but, um...

05:25.576 --> 05:28.370
judging by their faces,
we've been here a while.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.586
I had a great time tonight.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.004
- Me, too.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.427
A taxi guy, huh? Wow.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.095
Very retro of you.

05:45.429 --> 05:48.599
- Well, there's something magical
about taxis in this city, you know?

05:49.016 --> 05:51.643
The way you can
just raise your arm and...

05:53.562 --> 05:54.479
Damn.

05:55.147 --> 05:56.815
This would've been so cool

05:56.815 --> 05:58.984
if one showed up just right then.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.653
When you tell this story
of this date in the future,

06:01.653 --> 06:03.947
just promise me
you will change that part.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.616
FUTURE SOPHIE:
Whoops!

06:06.116 --> 06:07.242
- What makes you so sure

06:07.242 --> 06:09.453
I'm going to tell the story
of this date in the future?

06:10.370 --> 06:13.498
- Not sure. Just, um... hopeful.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.583
- Mm.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.383
- Now you show up?

06:23.383 --> 06:26.136
Right now. Hi.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.266
Hey, um, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

06:32.100 --> 06:34.937
- Tomorrow? As in 24 hours from now?

06:35.479 --> 06:37.356
- Uh-- Yeah, I know.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.858
You're not supposed to ask
a girl out two nights in a row,

06:39.858 --> 06:42.152
but, um, I like you, Sophie,

06:42.152 --> 06:44.321
and I want to see you again.

06:45.197 --> 06:46.949
But, if it's too soon...

06:46.949 --> 06:48.951
- No, it's not too soon.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.994
It's just...

06:51.537 --> 06:53.497
Tomorrow night's my birthday party.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.249
I'm turning 30.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.460
Do you want to stop by?

06:58.460 --> 06:59.711
- I'd love to.

07:00.504 --> 07:01.797
What can I bring?

07:01.797 --> 07:03.966
I've got a bottle of Sancerre,

07:03.966 --> 07:05.759
or-or a nice Pouilly-Fuissé,

07:05.759 --> 07:08.345
or, uh, maybe a Beaujolais Nouveau

07:08.345 --> 07:10.889
to celebrate the nouveau
decade of your life.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.850
FUTURE SOPHIE:
And that's when I realized

07:12.850 --> 07:15.310
I had invited a classy-ass man

07:15.310 --> 07:16.979
to a trashy-ass rager.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.189
OVERLAPPING:
Go! Go! Go! Come on, Ellen!

07:19.189 --> 07:20.440
- Hold up!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.109
We're gonna need to 180 this party stat.

07:25.571 --> 07:28.657
- Okay! I know bobbing for apples
in tequila is a little out there,

07:28.657 --> 07:30.909
and sure, if you open your eyes,
you can go blind.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.203
- No, but what a way to go.
- I'm up next!

07:33.203 --> 07:35.581
- Stop! No tequila bobbing, okay?

07:35.581 --> 07:37.708
And we're going to need
to get real cups.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.793
Like, cups made of actual glass.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.712
And we're going to need
to get some real food.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.714
Nothing flavored "nacho cheesier."

07:43.714 --> 07:46.216
- Slow down! Did something
happen on your date?

07:46.216 --> 07:48.677
Did you get hit by another Citi Bike?
Are you concussed?

07:48.677 --> 07:51.096
- No. No, my date was great.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.183
Drew is-- is direct, and he's grown up.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.185
He signals for the check like this.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.271
But, I invited him to this party tomorrow,

07:59.271 --> 08:01.690
so we're going to need to pivot.
- Hold up!

08:01.690 --> 08:03.400
You were all about Dirty 30,

08:03.400 --> 08:05.402
but then Drew signaled
for the check like my grandpa,

08:05.402 --> 08:07.696
and now, you want to change this
into some boring-ass,

08:07.696 --> 08:10.782
mature person party at
the last minute to impress him?

08:11.325 --> 08:12.910
- Correct.
- Okay--

08:12.910 --> 08:14.244
- Great. I'm so glad you understand.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.914
I'm going to update
the invite right now.

08:16.914 --> 08:20.209
No more dirty dress code.
Okay, classy cocktail attire.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.419
Okay!

08:22.419 --> 08:24.713
Keg number two has arrived.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.507
- Ooh, uh, don't hate me,

08:26.507 --> 08:29.134
but could we do cocktails
for the party instead?

08:29.134 --> 08:31.261
- Ooh yes. I've been
noodling with absinthe--

08:39.895 --> 08:41.480
We're going to take that to the grave,

08:41.480 --> 08:43.232
I Know What You Did Last Summer style.

08:48.070 --> 08:51.532
- Okay, we've got a raw bar ready to go.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.033
Candles are being lit.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.452
Valentina,
how are the new books looking?

08:55.452 --> 08:56.787
- Same as they looked at Goodwill

08:56.787 --> 08:58.455
a couple of hours ago
before you bought them.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.874
Why does a party need a book nook?

09:00.874 --> 09:02.501
- So I look like a grown-up.

09:02.501 --> 09:06.129
Quit questioning my classy,
mature choices!

09:06.129 --> 09:07.673
- Ladies?

09:07.673 --> 09:09.675
Care for this evening's
signature cocktail?

09:09.675 --> 09:11.760
The Sophisticated Sophie.

09:12.386 --> 09:13.595
Also, yes,

09:13.595 --> 09:16.265
I did polish my man-gagement ring
for its debut tonight.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.643
- Hm, what did you
polish it with? Dork juice?

09:21.395 --> 09:22.729
- Crap!

09:22.729 --> 09:25.566
Forgot to call to get
the heat pipe fixed! Mitt me.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.821
- Be careful, Soph.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.617
- Ah!

09:37.035 --> 09:38.662
I just made it angrier!

09:38.662 --> 09:40.664
- Mm...

09:40.664 --> 09:41.748
- Seriously?

09:41.748 --> 09:43.417
It's exactly 8:00 PM.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.420
What kind of a serial killer
shows up at the exact--

09:48.088 --> 09:51.925
Hi. Uh, right on time. I love that.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.427
- Happy birthday.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.430
- I was just doing a few,
uh, home improvements.

09:57.181 --> 09:58.640
Come in.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.726
Uh, we have a mixologist over there.

10:00.726 --> 10:01.977
Oh, you know Sid.

10:01.977 --> 10:04.146
And a raw bar over there.

10:04.688 --> 10:08.317
And the book nook is where
it's always been.

10:08.317 --> 10:11.236
Happy birthday, Soph.
What's going on? Hey...

10:11.236 --> 10:13.113
- Was this a costume party?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.407
- No. Mm. No, it's just...

10:15.407 --> 10:18.911
fashion, you know.
The early aughts are back.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.960
- Oh, Valentina. Hello.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.006
- Uh, hi...

10:31.006 --> 10:33.967
You know you don't have
to act like we're strangers?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.386
- Oh, I'm not.
This is just how I treat people

10:36.386 --> 10:38.472
who I'm somewhat together with.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.473
- Charlie...

10:39.890 --> 10:43.268
- If you'll excuse me, I see somebody
that I may go home with.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.270
For sexual intercourse.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.066
- Hey. Sorry that took so long.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.693
Sid keeps trying to get girls
to notice that he's man-gaged.

10:51.693 --> 10:52.986
Here.
- Oh.

10:53.529 --> 10:55.113
- I'm actually allergic to wine.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.366
- What?
- The sulfates make me really...

10:58.534 --> 10:59.910
pretty.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.453
- Hey, she's cute.

11:01.453 --> 11:02.829
- She's beautiful! Like...

11:02.829 --> 11:04.331
- Alright, this is perfect.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.667
It's time for the wing sibs
to take flight, okay?

11:06.667 --> 11:09.753
Follow me.
Hey, have you met Ellen?

11:09.753 --> 11:12.673
I'm Jesse, her big brother.
And you are...

11:12.673 --> 11:14.049
- I'm Holly.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.301
- Holly? Well, deck the halls!

11:16.301 --> 11:18.220
Ellen here just moved to the Big Apple

11:18.220 --> 11:20.514
from a dairy farm. Crazy, right?

11:23.308 --> 11:25.686
- We're not related by blood.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.605
- Hey! How are you?
- Hey.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.525
I'm sorry it's so hot in here.
Do you want me to take your jacket?

11:31.525 --> 11:34.778
- No. I've got pit stains
I'm not sure I can come back from.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.989
But, maybe we can open the window?

11:36.989 --> 11:39.616
It's stuck shut.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.410
Yeah, I've been meaning
to get that fixed.

11:41.410 --> 11:42.536
- It's all good.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.913
- Um, tell me about these books.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.249
Y-You highlighted a lot of this one.
- Yeah.

11:47.249 --> 11:50.002
Well, that's one of my faves.
Um, the...

11:50.002 --> 11:52.379
autobiography of Vanna White.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.382
- Let's see, uh...

11:55.382 --> 11:57.009
The Joy of Gay Sex.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.385
- Yeah.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.805
Just like to know what
everyone's up to... sexually. Hm.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.934
I'm gonna refresh your drink.
I'll be right back.

12:08.604 --> 12:11.023
I told you to screen the Goodwill books.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.818
- I did! This is a great read!

12:24.745 --> 12:27.748
Yes, I saw you looking at me,

12:27.748 --> 12:30.626
while I was talking to her.
- Maybe I was.

12:30.626 --> 12:33.545
- And... how did it feel?

12:33.545 --> 12:36.924
- It felt... extremely...

12:36.924 --> 12:37.925
hot.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.011
How do I explain this?

12:41.011 --> 12:42.888
I could tell you weren't
actually into her,

12:42.888 --> 12:44.848
but she was super into you,

12:44.848 --> 12:47.643
and knowing that
she couldn't have you,

12:47.643 --> 12:49.603
but I could...

12:49.603 --> 12:50.604
Hot.

12:51.897 --> 12:54.483
- Right. I am having a bit
of trouble keeping up here.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.860
I thought you wanted
to talk to other guys tonight.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.111
- I did.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.906
But now, I'd rather
watch you talk to other girls.

13:00.906 --> 13:03.617
- Valentina, you are completely insane.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.079
I'm very into it.

13:07.079 --> 13:08.580
Right.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.082
See that Christina over there?

13:10.082 --> 13:13.126
I'm going to get her genie
all hot and bothered,

13:13.126 --> 13:14.962
and leave it in the bottle.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.674
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

13:18.674 --> 13:20.801
- And I gotta say,
I love that ring you're wearing.

13:20.801 --> 13:21.885
- Thank you. I just got it.

13:21.885 --> 13:25.430
- I think it's awesome that you're
committed to your virginity. So brave.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.601
- Hm...
- Quick. Wine me.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.064
Mm...

13:36.108 --> 13:37.776
You're friends with Drew.
- Mm-hmm.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.444
- Does it seem like
he's having a good time?

13:39.444 --> 13:42.030
- Yeah. Sophie, chill. Drew wanted
to come to your birthday party

13:42.030 --> 13:44.366
after your first date.
That means he's super into you.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.785
- No. That means
he was into me last night,

13:46.785 --> 13:48.871
before he came
to this hot mess of a party.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.372
- Emphasis on hot.

13:51.707 --> 13:54.418
- At least the food looks sophisticated.
- Mm-hmm.

13:54.418 --> 13:57.421
- Look at these adorable
little baby quiches I made!

13:57.421 --> 13:58.797
- Aw.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.299
- No!
- Ew...

14:02.759 --> 14:04.011
Okay.

14:05.179 --> 14:07.181
I mean, look
at the amazing raw bar.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.852
- Uh...

14:12.352 --> 14:13.812
- There's something wrong
with those shrimp!

14:13.812 --> 14:15.522
- Sophie, these are raw.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.149
- Yeah, it's a raw bar.
- Uh-huh.

14:17.149 --> 14:19.401
The oysters are raw. The shrimp
in a raw bar are cooked.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.111
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.906
- I bet that is a very common mistake.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.074
- No, I don't think so.

14:27.451 --> 14:29.203
- So, how's it going with Holly?

14:30.162 --> 14:32.414
- That's how it's going.

14:32.414 --> 14:34.124
Oh...

14:34.124 --> 14:36.043
Well, maybe she's just
a big Christina fan.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.753
Look, you're an amazing girl.
Here's what we're gonna do.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.963
- We're not going to do anything.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.507
I don't wanna talk to you about it, okay?

14:42.174 --> 14:44.760
- We need apps. Now. Please.

14:44.760 --> 14:48.347
Anything fancy. Fancy chips,
fancy crackers, fancy nuts.

14:48.347 --> 14:49.848
Here's 10 bucks.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.851
- I'm sorry, do you think
I'm going shopping in 1962?

14:54.269 --> 14:55.604
- I'll go.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.440
Hey!

14:58.440 --> 15:00.817
Ellen! Hey, wait up!
Look, look, look, look, look.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.361
I know you said you
didn't wanna talk about it,

15:02.361 --> 15:04.321
but I just want you to know
I totally get why you're upset.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.114
It sucks getting
blown off like that.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.991
- I said I didn't want
to talk to you about it.

15:10.452 --> 15:11.495
- Oh.

15:12.371 --> 15:14.289
- How would you know
if I'm an amazing girl?

15:14.289 --> 15:15.707
You don't know anything about me.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.501
You don't know my last name

15:17.501 --> 15:19.711
or about my wine allergy.

15:19.711 --> 15:22.923
I own a produce farm, man, not dairy.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.801
- Wai-- So what, it's just,
like, a field of vegetables,

15:25.801 --> 15:27.219
and you watch them grow?

15:27.219 --> 15:29.263
- Yes! That's what produce farms are!

15:30.764 --> 15:32.474
- Oh.
- Look.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.518
There was a time
I dreamed of having a big brother,

15:34.518 --> 15:36.770
like Matt on 7th Heaven,

15:36.770 --> 15:38.981
who would teach me
how to slide in baseball,

15:38.981 --> 15:41.775
or go to the church social
with me when my date drops out,

15:41.775 --> 15:43.819
or give me a talking to
when I start huffing--

15:43.819 --> 15:45.737
- Wait, what? Y-you huffed paint?

15:45.737 --> 15:47.781
- No! The kids on 7th Heaven did!

15:48.782 --> 15:50.367
Point is

15:50.367 --> 15:51.952
you were there when I was little...

15:53.078 --> 15:54.413
and then you just disappeared.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.916
So, I moved here,
thinking we could reconnect

15:57.916 --> 16:00.752
and pick up where we left off. But...

16:02.087 --> 16:04.089
Now, I don't know if we can.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.717
I think it might be a little
too late for the whole...

16:06.717 --> 16:07.968
sibs thing.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.595
You know?

16:09.595 --> 16:11.930
We're more like...

16:11.930 --> 16:13.432
wing strangers.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.310
Trademark.

16:21.440 --> 16:24.234
- You ever felt the eyes
of your partner on you,

16:24.234 --> 16:27.154
watching, wanting as you
chat someone else up?

16:27.154 --> 16:29.323
'Cause Val and I learned tonight

16:29.323 --> 16:32.117
that it is exhilarating... Oh!

16:32.117 --> 16:35.078
You and Drew simply must try it.
- Ah, yeah.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.706
Sounds great, but we're
playing our own fun game tonight

16:37.706 --> 16:40.417
where I try not to kill him
with uncooked shrimp.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.585
Right now, I'm losing.

16:45.881 --> 16:46.798
Drew!

16:47.758 --> 16:49.593
Watch out for that hot--
- Ow!

16:49.593 --> 16:53.096
- I can still remember
the smell of burnt flesh and shrimp.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.349
Oh, that was a bad party.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.143
- I'm so, so sorry.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.228
- Oh...
- I've been meaning

16:59.228 --> 17:01.396
to get that hot pipe fixed for a while.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.402
I've been meaning
to get that fixed, too.

17:08.445 --> 17:09.488
- Hi...

17:13.367 --> 17:16.119
- This is so embarrassing, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, Sophie.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.664
No, it-it's fine, really.
- No, it's not.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.541
You know what? The truth is, Drew,

17:20.541 --> 17:23.418
we're the same age,
but we're not at the same stage.

17:23.418 --> 17:26.088
Now, I'm rhyming,
and I gotta get out of here.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.089
- Soph...

17:28.340 --> 17:29.466
- Hi.

17:29.466 --> 17:30.801
Uh, this is Charlie.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.219
- Hi, I'm Drew.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.721
- We've heard such fabulous things.
- Thank you.

17:38.392 --> 17:41.186
- You know, I remember the day that Mom
and Dad brought you home from Vietnam.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.607
I was 3, but I remember

17:45.607 --> 17:48.068
'cause it was like the most exciting
thing that had ever happened to me.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.612
I was totally obsessed with you.

17:51.321 --> 17:52.573
And you couldn't even do anything

17:52.573 --> 17:55.659
but poop and cry and look cute.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.661
- Still great at all those things.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.582
- Well, I also remember the day
that Mom and Dad split up.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.836
I was 9, and they told me
I could either stay in our house with Dad,

18:05.836 --> 18:08.755
or move with you and Mom
and her new boyfriend to Iowa.

18:09.548 --> 18:12.217
So, I chose to stay. I mean,
I didn't want Dad to be all alone.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.095
- I know.

18:15.095 --> 18:15.971
I remember.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.765
- I asked about you every day.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.935
"Can I call Ellen? Can we visit Ellen?"

18:23.061 --> 18:26.356
Anyway, I-I could tell it bugged Dad,
asking about you all the time.

18:26.356 --> 18:29.359
I think he thought I was
secretly asking about Mom or...

18:30.360 --> 18:33.113
something, so eventually, I just stopped.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.240
But...

18:35.616 --> 18:37.993
Maybe I should have kept asking...

18:37.993 --> 18:39.244
because...

18:40.954 --> 18:43.207
I'm sorry I missed out
on being your big brother.

18:43.916 --> 18:45.125
Okay?

18:45.125 --> 18:47.920
I also really wanted
to be that for you.

18:50.339 --> 18:51.840
- Were you really only 9?

18:52.758 --> 18:54.718
In my mind,

18:54.718 --> 18:56.345
you were so big.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.306
You were one of the grown-ups

18:59.306 --> 19:01.683
doing this bad thing to our family.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.685
- Ellen, I was 9.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.855
I had a race car bed.

19:09.191 --> 19:10.442
- You were 9.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.115
- Okay, come with me.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.867
Come on.

19:20.369 --> 19:23.914
- Okay, the key to a good
MetroCard swipe is confidence.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.999
You just have to do it fast
and with determination,

19:25.999 --> 19:27.876
like... like ripping off a wax strip.

19:27.876 --> 19:28.710
- You wax?

19:28.710 --> 19:31.964
- No, but I help Sid get beach ready
every summer. Okay, here we go.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.966
Now remember, swipe confident, okay?

19:33.966 --> 19:35.259
Zing!

19:36.343 --> 19:37.344
- Zing!

19:37.344 --> 19:38.804
- Okay, one more time.

19:38.804 --> 19:40.806
- Zing!
- You got it, you got it.

19:40.806 --> 19:42.182
- Zing!

19:42.182 --> 19:43.976
See? The subway hates me.

19:43.976 --> 19:46.395
- Oh, screw it. Let me just show you
how to jump confident.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.231
- No, no...

19:49.231 --> 19:51.149
- Yes, yes. You can do it.
Come on. Time to go.

19:51.149 --> 19:52.359
Time to move.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.610
- Ah!
- Woo!

19:53.610 --> 19:54.695
- I did it! I did it!

19:54.695 --> 19:56.822
I jumped a turnstile!
- Okay, it's still illegal. We gotta move.

19:58.532 --> 20:00.242
- Hey, you know what?

20:00.242 --> 20:02.661
- You wanna go again and do the thing
you like with the loofah?

20:02.661 --> 20:04.538
- No.

20:04.538 --> 20:07.416
I mean, yes, always. But...

20:08.709 --> 20:11.503
getting old and boring has always
scared the shit out of me.

20:12.004 --> 20:13.755
I mean, Sophie's book nook

20:13.755 --> 20:16.300
literally sent shivers
down my spine, and...

20:17.176 --> 20:20.304
I've always put monogamy in that category.

20:20.304 --> 20:23.849
But, with us, it's...
it's actually kind of...

20:25.976 --> 20:27.019
exciting.

20:28.729 --> 20:30.564
- I agree.

20:30.564 --> 20:34.401
We just had sex in the lone
unlocked bathroom of a very crowded party.

20:39.698 --> 20:42.826
So, does this mean that you are
ready to be together together?

20:43.827 --> 20:45.287
You short,

20:45.287 --> 20:47.331
beautiful, maddening woman?

20:49.875 --> 20:51.793
- Oh...

20:51.793 --> 20:53.504
fine!

21:03.931 --> 21:06.433
- Wow. This view is amazing.

21:07.935 --> 21:09.853
Why didn't you have the party up here?

21:10.395 --> 21:12.648
- My neighbor makes her own honey.

21:14.024 --> 21:16.026
Bees are very territorial.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.321
Although, everyone getting stung by bees

21:19.321 --> 21:21.573
probably would have been
less of a disaster.

21:22.157 --> 21:23.617
- And that's when I decided

21:23.617 --> 21:25.786
I wanted to start things off with Drew

21:25.786 --> 21:27.996
by being completely honest.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.332
- Okay. Truth.

21:31.291 --> 21:34.461
I went out and bought all of those books
this morning to impress you.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.463
- Sophie,
you didn't need to do that.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.714
- I know.

21:39.216 --> 21:42.427
It's just... you're so adult and...

21:43.345 --> 21:45.681
together and readery, and...

21:46.515 --> 21:48.183
it just makes me feel...

21:49.309 --> 21:50.519
kind of messy.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.313
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Drew,

21:53.313 --> 21:56.567
please don't do that thing where
you tell me your life's a mess, too.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.318
- Oh no, I wasn't going to say that.

21:58.318 --> 22:01.113
I make Overnight Oats.
I'm an extremely together person.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.992
What I was gonna say is that

22:04.992 --> 22:08.453
this whole, like,
being super mature thing, it's, um...

22:08.453 --> 22:10.289
yeah, it's not all it's cracked up to be.

22:10.956 --> 22:13.166
And sometimes, I feel like I missed out.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.878
You know?
Having those ridiculous nights

22:15.878 --> 22:17.880
that you look back on when you're old.

22:19.381 --> 22:22.634
But I think tonight
is one of those nights.

22:23.385 --> 22:26.597
I mean, I got burned, I...

22:26.597 --> 22:28.098
I caught your roommate having shower sex.

22:29.558 --> 22:31.685
Oh, I saw a bunch of people
inexplicably dressed

22:31.685 --> 22:34.104
as Christina Aguilera
from the Dirrty video.

22:34.104 --> 22:36.773
- Wait, y... You know Dirrty?

22:56.752 --> 22:58.587
- My god! Wow, okay.

22:58.587 --> 23:00.923
I really wish I had known
this side of you sooner.

23:00.923 --> 23:02.841
- Well, you know,
I usually save my renditions

23:02.841 --> 23:05.552
of TRL's greatest hits for the sixth date.

23:07.137 --> 23:08.972
- So, there's going to be a sixth date?

23:08.972 --> 23:10.849
- Oh, I hope so.

23:11.475 --> 23:13.101
- Me, too.

23:16.104 --> 23:18.607
FUTURE SOPHIE:
Son, I learned that night

23:18.607 --> 23:21.026
that 30 really is just a number.

23:21.026 --> 23:23.111
SOPHIE'S SON :
Mom, I never think about turning 30.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.989
That is, like, so old.
- Watch your mouth.

23:27.157 --> 23:28.700
Oh, wait!

23:28.700 --> 23:32.204
I-I forgot to tell you
how my party ended.

23:36.959 --> 23:38.710
- Oh, these are the people we led on

23:38.710 --> 23:40.587
while we were getting
turned on by each other.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.589
They're probably hanging around,
hoping to hook up with us.

23:42.589 --> 23:45.634
- God. We're just too damn desirable.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.055
Attention, please.

23:50.055 --> 23:52.474
Uh, you are all very sexy,

23:52.474 --> 23:55.352
but I am afraid I only have eyes
for this one here.

23:56.186 --> 23:58.146
- Aw, babe! Right back at you.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.690
Sorry, dudes, no hard feelings.

24:00.357 --> 24:02.150
- So rude.
- The rudest.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.987
Why can't everyone in
a relationship just be honest?

24:04.987 --> 24:07.197
The bartender
with the man-gagement ring.

24:07.197 --> 24:09.324
- Love that bartender.
He's so considerate.

24:09.324 --> 24:12.244
If every man were like him,
the world would be a better place.

24:15.873 --> 24:18.250
- Obviously, we can never tell Sid.
- Yeah, we'll take it to the grave.
