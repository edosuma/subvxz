WEBVTT

00:16.975 --> 00:20.145
-It looks like I went missing,

00:20.228 --> 00:23.773
but my parents tried to save money
with discount ad space.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.067
We did an hour photo shoot,
this is the photo you chose?

00:26.151 --> 00:26.985
Yeah, Al.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.903
Why is her picture so small?

00:29.362 --> 00:31.239
And is that a coupon for bacon?

00:31.322 --> 00:33.074
It's 'cause Joelle's new to the show.

00:33.158 --> 00:36.327
You know, like, the new kid
in school, like a kindergartener.

00:37.787 --> 00:40.373
Man, y'all don't appreciate
an artist's attention to detail.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.916
Okay, you know what? It's fine.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.668
Well, it's not fine,

00:43.752 --> 00:47.630
but this has to go up this week,
so we're gonna work on this.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.633
Okay. Just know my rate goes up
to $50 an hour.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.761
From $0 an hour?

00:52.844 --> 00:55.013
Don't exploit me, Jo. I'm an artist.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.014
Debatable.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.643
<i>Joelle Brooks isn't</i>
<i>used to being second string.</i>

01:00.727 --> 01:02.187
And as your valedictorian,

01:02.270 --> 01:04.939
I will take the spirit and determination
of all of us...

01:05.023 --> 01:06.691
<i>2015,</i>

01:06.775 --> 01:08.777

01:19.954 --> 01:24.042
<i>In fact, that's precisely what</i>
<i>Woodlawn was designed to do.</i>

01:24.125 --> 01:25.502
<i>Watch closely.</i>

01:26.002 --> 01:29.714
<i>1840, Spencer Wood,</i>

01:33.259 --> 01:38.223
And so his primitive nature
can be observed by his cranial slope,

01:38.306 --> 01:42.560
which indicates the size
of the underlying brain matter.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.979
<i>Though Spencer was</i>
<i>admitted into Winchester,</i>

01:45.063 --> 01:48.191

<i>Nevertheless, the spirit of Spencer Wood</i>

02:21.015 --> 02:23.268

02:28.314 --> 02:31.693
I'm giving these white boys
a run for their money.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.782
I am done with the Internet.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.492
Lies.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.245
For real. #NoMoreHashtags.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.664
Name one good thing
the Internet's ever given us.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.416
The Arab Spring,

02:46.499 --> 02:47.458
Bossip headlines,

02:47.542 --> 02:48.835
the gif-industrial complex

02:48.918 --> 02:50.712
and access to information.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.046
You mean misinformation.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.631
True. Somebody put on their Insta

02:53.715 --> 02:55.717
Chris Brown and Justin Bieber
were the same person,

02:55.800 --> 02:57.844
and truth be told,
I didn't even question it.

02:57.927 --> 03:01.848
And now they're making black bots
to amp up the bullshit on both sides.

03:01.931 --> 03:05.101
Mm-hmm. I saw some guy
called @ARealBlackPerson...

03:05.184 --> 03:06.644
Totally convincing, B-T-dubs.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.022
Right? Talking some mess about
a white genocide.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.232
Dear White People,
black folks don't have time

03:11.316 --> 03:12.567
for no white genocide. We're--

03:12.650 --> 03:14.277
Exhausted.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.654
And since everyone's anonymous,
who can tell the difference

03:16.738 --> 03:19.157
between a racist algorithm
and the racists among us?

03:19.240 --> 03:22.076
How you gonna be so hateful online,
then be normal to my face?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.661
They got me walking around here like--

03:23.745 --> 03:27.290
-Listen to this lie about me.
-Okay, I'll finish my thought later.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.877
"Sam White is the alien child
of a Zulu sea captain."

03:30.960 --> 03:32.462
Dear White People,

03:32.545 --> 03:34.547
ain't nobody trying
to start a black Scientology.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.508
That is, and always will be, your madness.
Claim it.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.053
Black people been so long done
with sea-crossing ships,

03:40.136 --> 03:41.387
-it's like--
-Hold that thought.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.431
Um, I think it's time for call-ins.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.141
Uh...

03:55.985 --> 03:57.070
Uh...

03:58.029 --> 03:59.822
We gotta stop sneaking around like this.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.325
Who's sneaking? I'm not sneaking.

04:04.786 --> 04:05.787
It's bright in here.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.414
You just walked in here like you're
in witness protection. Can't we just openly be F-R-I--

04:11.709 --> 04:13.920
Fried chicken?

04:14.003 --> 04:17.465
Sure, that sounds like a great lunch,
schoolmate.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.967
What about me says to black women,

04:19.050 --> 04:20.677
"Hide this man at all costs?"

04:20.760 --> 04:21.886
Sorry, but you know Sam.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.680
She does not process change well.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.766
Is that why she shit-talks my doc project
every chance she gets?

04:26.849 --> 04:29.102
This is what I mean.
I'm not about to be in these streets,

04:29.185 --> 04:31.145
playing <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i>
of y'all's cold war.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.023
So let's change topics.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.818
I never had a chance to say it,
but thank you for looking over my doc.

04:36.901 --> 04:40.905
I also cut down the amount of times
I ask if I'm racist by about 50%.

04:40.989 --> 04:44.033
Thank you for being open
to that suggestion

04:44.117 --> 04:46.160
and no worries. I thought it was great.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.914
You just make everything better just
by being around, you know that?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.875
If only I could order you in a Mahershala.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.460
Speaking of Reggie...

04:54.544 --> 04:56.921
Do I look like Sam's
sloppy seconds to you?

04:59.882 --> 05:00.883
Sorry.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.219
I've moved on.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.637
Really.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.224
It's just that when I look in the mirror,
I see someone who's beautiful

05:08.308 --> 05:10.935
and talented and...

05:11.978 --> 05:13.771
always the second one you think of.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.108
This world is not kind to the Kellys.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.485
Yeah, ever since Michael Strahan
left the show, it's just--

05:19.569 --> 05:21.195
Rowland, not Ripa.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.449
-That makes more sense.
-Yeah, come on, Gabe.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.207
Hi. Joelle Brooks.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.793
I'm normally in the Monday lab,
but I missed it.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.378
-Back table.
-Thanks.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.642
J. Brooks?

05:52.518 --> 05:54.270
I've always wondered who that was.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.230
King. Trevor King.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.902
T "Half a point on my heels" King!

06:00.985 --> 06:02.487
Nice to meet you, too.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.198
Hey, pleasure's all mine
now that we've met,

06:05.281 --> 06:07.575
and it's great seeing
a black woman on top.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.213
It's pretty clear, the cause of death.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.589
He couldn't breathe.

06:21.672 --> 06:22.882
The victim was black.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.469
Dark. The joke, not the person.

06:26.552 --> 06:30.056
The lack of oxygen was due
to multiple emboli in the right lung.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.225
However, the fatal event was not emboli,

06:32.308 --> 06:35.812
but rather the thrombosis here
on the large saddle thrombus.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.857
Should I tell 'em to calm down?
The body's dead.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.692
The right leg was swollen,

06:41.776 --> 06:43.444
deep vein thrombosis.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.862
The victim was bedridden.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.366
Knuckles look to be inflamed.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.037
Must be lupus.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.456
Had to have been on anticoagulants.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.084
Unless his antibodies...

06:58.584 --> 07:00.711
Anti-phospholipid syndrome.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.882
-We make a good team.
-That back-and-forth was so good,

07:04.966 --> 07:06.592
I feel like Shonda Rhimes wrote us.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.637
I was thinking that the whole time,
but I didn't think I could say it.

07:13.391 --> 07:16.018
No, not gonna do it.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.480
I can't let Joelle go back
to being J period Brooks.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.232
Go out with me.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.067
Um, okay.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.444
I've got Thursday.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.154
No, like now. Right now.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.115
Oof, I really can't leave campus.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.116
Okay, we don't have to.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.952
Let me show you something
that you've never seen before,

07:33.035 --> 07:34.036
and I promise,

07:34.120 --> 07:35.037
I won't murder you.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.875
I'm pretty sure that's
something murderers say,

07:38.958 --> 07:41.002
more importantly, if it's on campus,
I've seen it.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.254
Are you sure?
'Cause we're in the same anatomy class,

07:43.337 --> 07:44.839
and you're just now seeing me,

07:45.882 --> 07:50.470
and I'm just now seeing you.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.807
Come on.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.486
Where are we?

08:06.569 --> 08:07.945
Food science lab.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.740
They got exams every week.
Can you believe it?

08:10.823 --> 08:12.950
I do food tests every day.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.995
I just tested some
exquisite shoestring fries.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.372
Little Irish place. McDonald's.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.962
Madame.

08:28.090 --> 08:32.053
Kumamoto oyster with passion fruit ice
and Sichuan vinaigrette.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.096
Thank you.

08:35.431 --> 08:38.601
They used to throw this stuff away
until students caught on,

08:38.684 --> 08:40.561
but today, it's just us.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.402
Mmm.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.863
And I'm out here sustaining on nuggets.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.283
I thought I knew all of us here.
What house are you in?

08:54.367 --> 08:55.660
Webster.

08:55.743 --> 08:56.744
Luck of the draw.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.288
Let me guess. You...

09:01.332 --> 09:02.333
A-P girl.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.085
Mm. Obvi.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.920
I won't hold it against you.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.713
What's wrong with A

09:07.797 --> 09:10.299
A little too pop-woke for my taste.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.927
After a day of living
the black experience,

09:13.010 --> 09:15.012
the last thing I want
to do is talk about it.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.348
Sometimes we watch TV together.

09:17.431 --> 09:18.724
Oh, well, in that case... Come on, you should come through.

09:20.184 --> 09:21.936
I think you'd be pleasantly surprised.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.565
Or we could live here
and never leave.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.732
Hmm...

09:28.818 --> 09:31.529
Cheers.

09:33.656 --> 09:34.615
Wow.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.535
Lavender and charcoal ice cream.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.745
-Imagine having the privilege of thinking,

09:39.829 --> 09:41.789
"What's not food and how can I eat it?"

09:44.709 --> 09:47.795
You know, white-watching is one
of my favorite pastimes.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.422
Yeah, it's like watching baseball,

09:49.505 --> 09:51.924
but without the franchise-approved
racist mascots.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.467
Spoke too soon.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.532
Hmm.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.785
Who knew there'd have
been a book in there?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.912
The things our campus security has
to suss out.

10:21.996 --> 10:22.997
Yep.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.291
One day, we won't have to live like this,

10:25.374 --> 10:28.210
'cause as soon as we realize
they're never gonna give it to us,

10:28.294 --> 10:29.295
we have to--

10:32.214 --> 10:34.634
Sorry. I get a little intense
about these things.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.135
I know exactly how you feel.

10:37.053 --> 10:37.887
I'm glad.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.513
Man...

10:40.348 --> 10:42.725
a lot of girls can't handle
real conversations.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.774
-This has been lovely.

10:49.857 --> 10:52.026
-We spent two hours together.

10:52.109 --> 10:55.780
I mean, I really want to spend
a few more together.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.741
Just saying.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.326
Okay.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.495
Thanks to CORE...

11:02.578 --> 11:03.788
And me!

11:03.871 --> 11:05.289
...and its president...

11:05.373 --> 11:06.457
Me!

11:06.540 --> 11:09.627
we've secured Carson Rhodes
to come speak.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.838
Hell yeah! That's my boy.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.760
And with all the bullshit AltIvyW's
unleashed, this is just what we need.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.595
Carson is incredible at starting dialogue.

11:19.678 --> 11:20.888
And ending it.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.349
Anybody see Carson shut down
that Rikki Carter chick?

11:23.432 --> 11:24.975
-Some Fox News pundit.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.352
And my future wife.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.521
She is a brilliant political mind.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.815
Lord, Fox News churns out
conservative nutjobs

11:30.898 --> 11:33.150
almost as fast as
sexual harassment settlements.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.736
Here. I, uh... I got the clip.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.072
<i>At the end of the day,</i>

11:38.155 --> 11:41.450
<i>society's vulnerable need safe spaces</i>
<i>where they can thrive.</i>

11:41.534 --> 11:43.744
A "safe space" does nothing
but coddle people

11:43.828 --> 11:45.246
and put them in a victim mindset.

11:45.329 --> 11:48.624
Really? This entire country
has been a safe space

11:48.707 --> 11:50.668
for the white and privileged
since its founding.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.628
You're saying we should
forever be in a tit-for-tat

11:52.711 --> 11:54.672
because of what happened in the past?
It's regressive.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.799
Their past is our present,
Rikki, and you know that.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.009
Okay, why are you the
highest

11:59.093 --> 12:00.386
You tell me.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.430
Because you're a sideshow, that's why.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.181
Alt-black woman

12:04.265 --> 12:06.016
defends alt-right.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.727
Why you think they pay a premium for it?

12:08.727 --> 12:10.354
Uh, so I'm well-paid because I'm black,

12:10.438 --> 12:11.689
not because I'm talented?

12:11.772 --> 12:13.482
I thought you were for affirmative action.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.817
That's a yes.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.402
I think that's a yes.

12:16.485 --> 12:17.611
Yo, they literally found

12:17.695 --> 12:19.947
a Ladera Heights' Tomi Lahren.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.408
Where is the lie in what she said?

12:22.491 --> 12:25.202
Oh. You guys don't like her
'cause she disagrees with you.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.079
James, just because you like her

12:27.163 --> 12:29.206
doesn't mean she's going to
jump out of your dreams

12:29.290 --> 12:31.542
and fall into your frail, mismatched arms.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.420
-I heard Carson was a hotep.
-No, he supports women's rights.

12:34.503 --> 12:35.463
He just hates Rikki.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.549
Maybe I'm missing something,
but I kind of agree with her.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.050
You might be missing the time

12:40.134 --> 12:42.011
when she advocated
for white history month.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.429
You're taking her out of context.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.598
Hey, Reg, break it down for me.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.641
Isn't she arguing for more diversity?

12:47.725 --> 12:50.603
Don't we want to come together?
-We are together,

12:50.686 --> 12:53.022
24/7, but for some you people,

12:53.105 --> 12:54.064
coming together means

12:54.148 --> 12:56.484
ignoring our experiences.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.568
"You people?"

12:58.861 --> 13:01.363
Yes, you white people.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.158
It feels weird being reduced to a color,
huh?

13:04.241 --> 13:05.743
Yeah, it does.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.537
Some of us
need our own space sometimes.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.165
We've been through a lot.
We go through a lot.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.208
Keep going.

13:12.917 --> 13:16.045
How many bestsellers are being written
about the white working class?

13:16.128 --> 13:17.338
Hm?

13:17.421 --> 13:19.757
They are the ones
that we need to protect.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.717
Let their life expectancy
and income plummet

13:21.800 --> 13:23.552
to where black people have always been,

13:23.636 --> 13:25.930
but now they are in crisis.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.474
You know better than this, Rikki.

13:28.557 --> 13:30.267
You do! Just address it!

13:30.351 --> 13:31.977
Yeah! Whoo!

13:53.832 --> 13:55.334
Ah, shit, Joelle.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.293
What's this?

13:57.336 --> 13:58.712
A little sexting going on?

13:58.796 --> 14:00.047
This is none of your business,

14:00.130 --> 14:02.216
and do not say a word to anyone.

14:02.299 --> 14:05.094
He has a bad habit
of looking over people's shoulders.

14:05.177 --> 14:08.013
That is one of his
many, many shortcomings.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.682
Also...

14:09.765 --> 14:11.559
-body odor.
-Fuck you.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.477
I use Axe body spray.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.562
"Anarchy for Him."

14:14.645 --> 14:17.189
I have never longed more
for the rule of law.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.024
Can you do whatever this is
somewhere else?

14:19.108 --> 14:20.192
All right, later, guys.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.194
They got nachos today,
and I gotta get that <i>queso</i>

14:22.278 --> 14:23.320
before it forms a skin.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.826
So who is this guy
Al was being nosy about?

14:28.909 --> 14:29.952
Why haven't we met him?

14:30.035 --> 14:31.829
I want all of the tea.

14:31.912 --> 14:32.872
Rashid...

14:34.415 --> 14:36.125
Every time I bring a guy around here,

14:36.208 --> 14:39.712
they see my girl Sam and it's like,
"New phone, who dis?"

14:39.795 --> 14:40.963
What do you mean?

14:41.547 --> 14:42.631
Think about it.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.429
If a guy cannot see how beautiful you are,

14:49.096 --> 14:50.389
he is blind.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.687
Al has a good point
about the <i>queso</i> skin.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.105
I'll leave you to your messages.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.112
I think tomorrow has to be
all Rikki Carter.

15:05.195 --> 15:07.197
I gotta break this girl down
before mulatto madness

15:07.281 --> 15:08.741
takes me all the way over.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.911
Yeah, she's... wow.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.248
Um, hey, Jo?

15:17.416 --> 15:19.627
Are you boy

15:19.710 --> 15:21.253
What? No.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.672
You've been humming <i>Weak </i>all day

15:23.756 --> 15:26.133
and SWV is boy-smiling music.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.761
I am not, and black people
are always humming <i>Weak.</i>

15:31.430 --> 15:32.765
Okay, yeah, I hung out with a guy.

15:32.848 --> 15:33.807
Ah!

15:33.891 --> 15:35.935
Jo got a man!

15:36.018 --> 15:37.770
Jo got a man!

15:37.853 --> 15:38.854
Girl!

15:38.938 --> 15:42.024
Why didn't you text me
or FaceTime, livestream? I don't know.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.609
You should've brought him to caucus.

15:43.692 --> 15:48.405
Oh, I'm not ready to bring him
into this... circle just yet.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.074
"Just yet"?

15:50.157 --> 15:52.284
Why? Is he white,

15:52.368 --> 15:53.285
and your TA?

15:53.369 --> 15:55.412
Because that would be unacceptable.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.873
Whenever I bring someone around too soon,
it never works out. I just don't want to jinx it.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.627
I get it. I do.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.088
I'm just so excited for you!

16:04.505 --> 16:06.632
How you walk around with that skin

16:06.715 --> 16:09.385
and all of this and stay single,

16:09.468 --> 16:10.552
I have never understood. Bitch, me neither.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.431
Okay, tell me more, tell me more.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.766
What's his name

16:15.849 --> 16:18.102
-Okay, um, Trevor.
-Uh-huh.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.521
And flirting over a dead body.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.024
No further questions,
except, what's his last name?

16:24.108 --> 16:25.442
Oh, um, Mind-ya.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.986
Trevor Mind-ya...

16:27.069 --> 16:28.946
With a Y.

16:29.029 --> 16:32.533
It's weird. Nothing's coming-- Oh!

16:32.616 --> 16:34.368
-Okay, bitch.
-Okay.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.496
Dad's a doctor. Mom's a lawyer.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.999
They're totes in love, 30 years,

16:40.082 --> 16:41.583
no pressure.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.169
I grew up in, like,
a TV Huxtable paradise,

16:44.253 --> 16:45.546
but now I'm in a different world,

16:45.629 --> 16:47.297
except with lots of white extras.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.842
Well, you're killing it, J period Brooks.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.385
All right, smart lady,

16:51.468 --> 16:53.679
which one of these
are not like the others?

16:54.179 --> 16:57.182
Why do our dates always feel like
something Neil deGrasse Tyson would host?

16:57.266 --> 17:01.395
'Cause nothing enthralls me more than
to see a beautiful woman use her mind.

17:01.478 --> 17:04.940
Well, in that case...

17:06.233 --> 17:07.359
Um...

17:07.443 --> 17:08.360
<i>"Noche te ipsum."</i>

17:08.444 --> 17:10.279
"Know thyself," Winchester's motto.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.405
Duh.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.282
<i>"Ad vitam aeternam."</i>

17:13.365 --> 17:14.533
"To life everlasting,"

17:14.616 --> 17:16.910
that's the School of Humanities...

17:17.870 --> 17:20.748
<i>"Obscuris vera involvens..."</i>

17:20.831 --> 17:22.666
This one doesn't match any
of the schools here.

17:28.630 --> 17:29.757
Whoo!

17:31.383 --> 17:33.719
Library of the damned.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.805
All the banned books
by Winchester professors.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.433
When Winchester discovered that
their history was controversial,

17:39.516 --> 17:40.768
they buried it.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.311
Of course.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.146
What?

17:50.527 --> 17:53.197
-Uh-huh.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.199
So from here, we can see

17:55.282 --> 17:59.286
the meeting places of the most
influential secret societies of the world.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.246
Scribes of Carthage,

18:01.330 --> 18:03.707
home to a third
of the world's billionaires.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.084
The Stonemen:

18:05.167 --> 18:07.086
half of Congress.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.003
The Lavender Gems...

18:08.087 --> 18:09.129
Aww, they sound cute.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.839
They're responsible for several genocides.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.841
-Mm-hmm.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.259
Damn, that's too many.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.095
I can break down the whole world
for you now.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.555
So the power consolidation allows
for the ruling class

18:18.639 --> 18:20.808
to maintain superiority s--

18:21.809 --> 18:22.893
Am I doing too much?

18:23.310 --> 18:24.603
Just enough.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.358
We both know that Ivies all started
as a meet-cute for the wealthy,

18:29.441 --> 18:30.651
but that was the old world.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.569
Some of us are working on
a new one, you know?

18:32.653 --> 18:33.821
Oh.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.281
-That's why I love A-P.

18:36.365 --> 18:40.452
There was a time when the only
black people on this campus were slaves.

18:40.536 --> 18:41.912
Now we got our own house.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.207
Okay, Neil. Now it's my turn to show you something.

18:47.876 --> 18:51.463
Okay. As long as there's
induced intellectual ennui.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.340
My favorite kind of ennui.

19:04.184 --> 19:05.102
You okay?

19:05.185 --> 19:06.395
Yeah.

19:09.064 --> 19:12.151
While all those secret societies
are planning world domination,

19:12.234 --> 19:13.861
this is what our folks were up to.

19:13.944 --> 19:14.945
And what's that?

19:15.028 --> 19:18.198
A-P stands over a stop
on the Underground Railroad.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.783
No way.
Yep.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.618
Over the years, A-P kids came down here

19:21.702 --> 19:23.871
and added art and smoked pot,

19:23.954 --> 19:25.914
and if I'm honest,

19:25.998 --> 19:27.291
probably got it in.

19:28.625 --> 19:29.918
Have they no respect?

19:35.340 --> 19:36.508
What's that?

20:17.007 --> 20:20.093
Oh, man, our people are so obsessed

20:20.177 --> 20:21.553
with dressing the part, huh?

20:21.637 --> 20:23.847
Why am I the only dressed like
an actual student?

20:23.931 --> 20:27.351
Bet they're saying, "Why'd Joelle let
her Lyft driver come inside with her?"

20:27.434 --> 20:30.437
Don't sell yourself short.
You could drive an Uber in that.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.813
Thank you.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.607
So this is our dining hall.

20:33.690 --> 20:37.236
They just started serving grits
and NBD, it's amaze.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.862
And this is our lounge,

20:38.946 --> 20:40.197
where we get our weekly dose

20:40.280 --> 20:42.407
of escapist black fantasy.

20:42.491 --> 20:43.450
Wow.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.621
Of course.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.122
Obviously, you're the draw, right?

20:49.206 --> 20:51.333
That's some bullshit.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.834
See, that's stuff I don't like.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.420
Real sisters getting side-kicked
by these light-skinned chicks.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.589
Sam's not like that on purpose.
She's my girl.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.383
-Mm-hmm.
Yo, Jo.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.344
You still on for... open mic tomorrow?

21:02.803 --> 21:04.012
We've got plans tomorrow.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.265
Hey, I'm Trevor King.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.182
Reggie.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.226
-Pleasure.
-Nice to meet you.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.353
Trevor and I have anatomy together.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.021
Yes, we do.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.692
-Cool, cool. See you around.
-Okay. Yeah.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.610
Jo!

21:18.694 --> 21:20.195
There you are.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.240
Just wanted to update you on
your incredibly urgent matter.

21:23.323 --> 21:25.284
Uh

21:25.367 --> 21:27.244
Davis House kids found out
I'm head of house,

21:27.327 --> 21:28.829
they actually have expectations of me.

21:29.746 --> 21:33.875
Like, did you know we're required to have
two vegan options for every meal?

21:33.959 --> 21:35.168
I've requested it many times.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.337
You're the reason I can't get my life
on track.

21:37.754 --> 21:40.465
How many windows I gotta break
to get these people off my back?

21:40.549 --> 21:42.384
Just keep proving them right, brother.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.136
What's that mean?

21:44.219 --> 21:46.847
Only thing they love more than saying
they gave one of us a chance

21:46.930 --> 21:48.807
is seeing us squander it.

21:52.185 --> 21:53.395
Think I'll wait over there.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.357
Sorry, he's...

21:57.441 --> 21:58.692
Well, he's kind of right, Troy.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.080
Kamal!

22:12.164 --> 22:14.833
Whoo, mama needs you to rub her feet!

22:14.916 --> 22:17.085
I've had to fight in so many elevators...

22:17.169 --> 22:20.881
This fucking show.
-Ugh, so extra, but so fun.

22:20.964 --> 22:23.425
Ooh, this is the one where P Ninny cameos.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.927
Mom, it's not what it looks like.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.429
Mm-hmm.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.222
Just like me catching you
in my red bottoms

22:29.306 --> 22:30.682
ain't what it looked like, neither?

22:30.766 --> 22:31.600
Mom...

22:31.933 --> 22:33.852
You like cock, Kamal.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.609
Cupcake, Kamal, it's me.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.027
P Ninny.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.320
Got some bad news, y'all.

22:43.695 --> 22:44.654
What it is, P?

22:45.238 --> 22:46.364
Well, you know your daddy,

22:46.448 --> 22:47.365
James Prince,

22:47.449 --> 22:48.784
Prince of Pality Records?

22:48.867 --> 22:50.285
He's dead.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.203
Again.

22:51.286 --> 22:53.246
-Oh.

22:54.372 --> 22:56.541
<i>Last year's funeral was so beautiful.</i>

22:56.625 --> 22:59.169
<i>Those holograms of Whitney</i>
<i>and Prince and Michael</i>

22:59.252 --> 23:00.962
<i>singing Destiny's Child's greatest hits?</i>

23:01.588 --> 23:03.548
<i>He ain't coming back, y'all.</i>

23:04.925 --> 23:06.635
This is what I'm talking about.

23:06.718 --> 23:07.928
Another piece of propaganda

23:08.011 --> 23:10.013
designed to erode the black family.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.973
Propaganda might be giving it
too much credit.

23:12.057 --> 23:15.102
You don't think it's a coincidence
that the biggest black show in the country

23:15.185 --> 23:16.478
is about a dysfunctional family

23:16.561 --> 23:18.230
and the only redeeming character's a fag?

23:18.313 --> 23:19.356
Whoa.

23:19.439 --> 23:21.149
Ugh, <i>Prince O'Palities</i> ?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.068
We keep missing <i>That is Them</i>
for this crap,

23:23.151 --> 23:24.778
which I'd like to add,
has a diverse cast.

23:24.861 --> 23:25.862
<i>That is Them?</i>

23:25.946 --> 23:29.116
You mean the show about the noble negro
that gets adopted

23:29.199 --> 23:31.368
into the white fantasy? Oh, I'm sorry.

23:31.451 --> 23:32.410
Family.

23:32.494 --> 23:33.703
It is,

23:33.787 --> 23:36.039
but when you say it like that,
it sounds bad.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.126
Look, I am not a racist.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.961
Nobody here is a racist.

23:41.044 --> 23:44.381
We just want to feel welcomed
into our new home.

23:44.464 --> 23:46.591
What does that have to do
with the lunch menu?

23:46.675 --> 23:49.886
The smell of fried food
makes me gag. It's oppressive.

23:49.970 --> 23:53.849
Oh, the A-P house.
The bastion of black life at Winchester.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.435
Joelle, you know you're a queen,
don't you?

23:57.602 --> 24:00.021
Wait a minute, queen like Nubian queen
or like Queen Latifah?

24:00.105 --> 24:01.231
Nubian.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.941
You are better than this place.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.401
Oh, no.

24:04.484 --> 24:05.777
I can break down the world
for you now.

24:05.861 --> 24:06.778
Keep proving them right.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.072
Soon as you realize
they're never gonna give it to us...

24:09.823 --> 24:11.074
You got more conspiracy theories

24:11.158 --> 24:13.869
than that dude with the hair
who believes aliens built the pyramids.

24:13.952 --> 24:14.911
They might've.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.581
You have an obsession with power
and just threw the "F" word around

24:17.664 --> 24:19.374
like you're in England,
looking for a smoke.

24:19.457 --> 24:20.542
Oh, no.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.752
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.381
Trevor, are you a hotep?

24:26.465 --> 24:28.717
<i>Hotep</i> is Egyptian for "peace."
What I'm trying to say is--

24:28.800 --> 24:30.051
God damn it!

24:30.594 --> 24:32.846
How could I not see this before?
I got got by a hotep?

24:32.929 --> 24:34.806
Hey, Jo, is everything okay?

24:34.890 --> 24:36.683
-Everything's fine.
-I was talking to my friend.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.518
Trying to have a conversation,
halfrican-American.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.730
-Don't talk to her like that!

24:41.813 --> 24:43.481
Whoa, you did not just say that.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.941
Joelle.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.068
Gabe, what are you doing here?

24:47.152 --> 24:49.196
You left this
at the law lounge the other day.

24:49.279 --> 24:51.198
-Thank you.
I tried to text you.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.201
Um... you guys have been hanging out?

24:54.284 --> 24:57.204
He just had some questions,
and we decided to get coffee.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.288
Ten times.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.040
Jo!
-Sam.

25:00.123 --> 25:02.000
The Young Republicans
just booked Rikki Carter.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.210
Get the fuck out of here.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.378
You know what?
I don't think this is gonna work.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.713
You take orders from that one,

25:06.796 --> 25:08.590
sneaking around with this one.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.550
Yeah, I think I misjudged you.

25:10.634 --> 25:11.593
Yo, bro.

25:11.676 --> 25:12.636
What makes you think

25:12.719 --> 25:14.763
you could even step to Joelle
with this shit?

25:14.846 --> 25:16.348
She a real one. She ain't property.

25:16.431 --> 25:17.891
Well, she acts like it.

25:17.974 --> 25:18.892
You all do,

25:18.975 --> 25:21.228
with your skinny jean-wearing,
identity-politicking,

25:21.311 --> 25:23.021
designer shoe-addicted asses.

25:23.104 --> 25:24.648
Okay, listen, you know what, "king,"

25:24.731 --> 25:26.983
let me tell you--
-Sam, I got this.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.526
Ooh, let's take down the black man.

25:28.610 --> 25:31.404
Oh, you think the black man
has a monopoly on suffering?

25:31.488 --> 25:33.240
You have no clue
what black women go through,

25:33.323 --> 25:34.991
probably 'cause
you can't get close to one,

25:35.075 --> 25:36.409
'cause you're fucking whack.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.537
We deal with the same shit
society heaps on you,

25:38.620 --> 25:40.872
then turn around
and deal with the shit you heap on us.

25:40.956 --> 25:44.709
Why don't you take your self-aggrandizing,
overcompensating dusty ass back

25:44.793 --> 25:47.462
Fuck all of this,

25:47.546 --> 25:50.257
'cause all you do is defend fags
and dudes wearing dresses

25:50.340 --> 25:51.466
that want to be called "she,"

25:51.550 --> 25:54.177
and then this uppity bitch wants
to take down black men,

25:54.261 --> 25:56.554
the most disrespected,
disenfranchised group

25:56.638 --> 25:58.598
that constantly takes the back seat.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.935
Take a back seat to this, nigga.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.272
Now get the fuck up and get the fuck out.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.815
-God damn.
-Mother--

26:23.540 --> 26:28.211
I thought you didn't use your fists
to resolve problems.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.046
You resolved it.

26:30.130 --> 26:32.340
-I just cleaned up the mess.

26:32.424 --> 26:36.303
And his mouth just looked
so damn punchable.
