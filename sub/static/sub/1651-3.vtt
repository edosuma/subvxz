00:07.236 --> 00:09.170
CIC, Bridge.
What are we dealing with here?

00:09.205 --> 00:10.805
Sir, EW reports
it's an old version

00:10.840 --> 00:12.640
of a Kirov-class
guided missile cruiser.

00:12.675 --> 00:14.509
<i>Nuclear powered and</i>
<i>possibly carrying warheads.</i>

00:14.543 --> 00:16.644
I thought those were mothballed
in the '90s.

00:16.679 --> 00:19.013
They're old and ugly,
but they're still dangerous.

00:19.048 --> 00:21.249
With whom do I have the pleasure
of speaking?

00:21.283 --> 00:24.085
I am Konstantin
Nicolayevitch Ruskov,

00:24.153 --> 00:25.854
a former vice admiral

00:25.888 --> 00:27.489
<i>of the Red Banner</i>
<i>Northern Fleet</i>

00:27.523 --> 00:28.757
<i>of the Russian Federation.</i>

00:28.791 --> 00:30.592
Messenger of the watch.

00:30.626 --> 00:32.994
Please go to my at-sea cabin and
grab me a book off the shelf,

00:33.028 --> 00:34.062
the one in Russian.

00:34.096 --> 00:34.863
Aye, Captain.

00:37.133 --> 00:39.901
<i>Admiral, I need to advise you</i>

00:39.935 --> 00:42.137
<i>that you are in United States</i>
<i>territorial waters</i>

00:42.171 --> 00:44.005
<i>and are standing into danger.</i>

00:44.073 --> 00:47.776
Withdraw seaward or you will be
subject to defensive action.

00:47.810 --> 00:51.679
Commander Chandler, I have
pursued you across the globe,

00:51.747 --> 00:54.182
<i>but I wish no further conflict.</i>

00:54.216 --> 00:56.151
After you have met my demands,

00:56.185 --> 00:57.519
you and your crew

00:57.586 --> 00:59.587
<i>will be free</i>
<i>to leave the harbor</i>

00:59.622 --> 01:01.723
<i>and travel the Earth</i>
<i>as you please.</i>

01:01.791 --> 01:04.559
And what would
those demands be?

01:04.593 --> 01:06.060
Well, let's not be coy.

01:06.095 --> 01:08.229
<i>You have the primordial strain</i>

01:08.264 --> 01:10.799
<i>of the virus</i>
<i>that is killing the world.</i>

01:10.833 --> 01:13.902
You will hand it over to me,
along with Dr. Rachel Scott

01:13.936 --> 01:15.637
<i>and all of her research.</i>

01:17.039 --> 01:20.975
Sorry, Admiral, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:21.010 --> 01:25.716
<i>And the thing is,</i>
<i>I don't take orders from you.</i>

01:25.717 --> 01:27.981
And now I'm gonna
ask you one more time.

01:27.982 --> 01:29.884
Move your ship.

01:30.081 --> 01:35.152
<i>Your Navy and your country</i>
<i>no longer exist.</i>

01:35.186 --> 01:37.754
<i>There is no higher authority</i>
<i>but me.</i>

01:37.789 --> 01:39.756
If you don't do as I say,

01:39.791 --> 01:42.893
you and your crew
will leave this harbor

01:42.927 --> 01:44.695
atop a mushroom cloud.

01:44.729 --> 01:47.097
You saw what happened
to France.

01:47.131 --> 01:49.967
You know what my ship
is capable of.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:58.042 --> 02:00.978
<i>Admiral Ruskov,</i>

02:01.012 --> 02:04.615
I suggest we meet somewhere
face to face,

02:04.649 --> 02:08.217
negotiate a peaceful solution
to our problem.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.858
It will be my pleasure.

Sync and corrections by n17t01

02:31.376 --> 02:33.677
Who else has been working
on a vaccine?

02:33.711 --> 02:35.879
What, in the world?

02:35.913 --> 02:37.180
Everyone.

02:37.215 --> 02:39.116
What about the Russians?
Were they close?

02:39.150 --> 02:42.819
I mean, nobody was making
any real progress.

02:42.854 --> 02:45.055
And I hate to say it, but they're
probably all dead anyway. Why?

02:45.123 --> 02:47.324
If somebody had the primordial
strain of the virus,

02:47.358 --> 02:50.260
the stuff you found in the ice,
could they make a vaccine?

02:52.363 --> 02:53.997
I suppose, if they had
the right equipment

02:54.032 --> 02:55.232
and someone qualified
to run it.

02:55.266 --> 02:56.466
But they'd be months behind us.

02:56.501 --> 02:57.834
I need to borrow
Dr. Tophet.

02:57.869 --> 03:00.003
Can you spare him?

03:07.345 --> 03:10.847
- Out of the fryin' pan, huh, fellas?
- What?

03:10.915 --> 03:12.049
You joining the team?

03:12.083 --> 03:13.884
Captain thought I'd be useful,

03:13.918 --> 03:15.852
seeing as you're all playing
in my backyard.

03:15.887 --> 03:17.354
And before the plague,

03:17.388 --> 03:19.256
the Fufu Cantina,
that was the place, boy.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.925
Old Juan Carlo, he made
the best mimosas locas.

03:21.959 --> 03:24.127
We got to get some of that.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.129
God help us.

03:26.464 --> 03:29.132
Suppose there's no way
to convince you not to go?

03:29.166 --> 03:31.201
Konstantin Ruskov's
a military genius.

03:31.235 --> 03:33.603
Literally wrote the book
on modern naval warfare.

03:33.638 --> 03:35.772
Maybe you can ask him
to sign your copy.

03:35.806 --> 03:39.042
Seriously, Captain, there's only
one way out of this harbor.

03:39.076 --> 03:41.645
Every minute we sit here gives
that asshole time to dig in.

03:41.679 --> 03:45.281
He's already dug in.
Meeting him is the only way.

03:45.316 --> 03:49.252
I need to look him in the eyes.

04:07.171 --> 04:10.273
Smith, Berchem,
establish the perimeter.

04:13.277 --> 04:15.111
Masks up.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.695
You needn't bother
with the masks.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.329
We're not infected.

04:33.364 --> 04:36.466
Well, we'll
test you just the same.

04:40.504 --> 04:42.605
I'm unarmed.

05:02.159 --> 05:03.860
Make a fist.

05:10.501 --> 05:15.138
How can you wear those costumes
in this heat?

05:15.172 --> 05:16.673
Still, better
than the Arctic, no?

05:16.707 --> 05:19.275
The Arctic was bad
for both of us, Admiral.

05:19.343 --> 05:22.712
As I recall,
you lost five airships.

05:22.747 --> 05:26.182
Helicopters are easy
to replace.

05:26.217 --> 05:27.450
Look around you.

05:27.485 --> 05:30.353
The world is ours
for the taking.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.861
He's clean.

05:37.895 --> 05:40.663
You see? Clean.

05:44.335 --> 05:47.871
XO, take a look.

05:54.278 --> 05:56.813
They're mining the bay.

05:56.847 --> 05:58.815
We could scare 'em off
with the .50-cals.

05:58.849 --> 06:00.517
No.

06:00.551 --> 06:02.418
Can't risk a fire fight
with the CO off the bridge.

06:02.486 --> 06:04.721
TAO, Bridge.
Get the Hunter in the water.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.890
Find me a clear route
out of this harbor.

06:06.924 --> 06:10.426
And spin Tomahawks
one through six.

06:10.461 --> 06:12.195
If I don't hear from the Captain
in one hour,

06:12.229 --> 06:14.597
we're unloading on that Russian
son of a bitch.

06:14.632 --> 06:19.202
Mines.
I hate freakin' mines.

06:19.236 --> 06:21.171
I told Moscow it was suicide

06:21.205 --> 06:23.206
and that we must remain at sea

06:23.240 --> 06:25.575
if we are to survive
this plague,

06:25.609 --> 06:26.910
but they insisted--

06:26.977 --> 06:29.779
"All ships must
return to home ports."

06:29.814 --> 06:32.749
And so I took matters
into my own hands.

06:32.817 --> 06:35.618
You are looking
at the last admiral

06:35.653 --> 06:39.355
of the last ship of
the once great Russian Navy.

06:39.423 --> 06:44.727
So the uniform we wear
matters no more.

06:44.762 --> 06:46.663
Well, it matters to me.

06:46.730 --> 06:48.531
Whether mine is one of a dozen

06:48.566 --> 06:50.266
or the last ship to survive,

06:50.301 --> 06:52.268
we're all sailors
of the United States Navy.

06:52.303 --> 06:53.570
Of course you are.

06:53.604 --> 06:58.675
Still, that we are here
is cause to rejoice, no?

06:58.709 --> 07:00.710
You got a funny way
of celebrating, Admiral--

07:00.778 --> 07:02.512
firing a nuclear weapon
at France.

07:02.546 --> 07:07.550
How many people do you think
you killed-- 5, 10 million?

07:07.585 --> 07:08.918
France was already dead.

07:08.953 --> 07:11.387
That missile
was meant to stop you,

07:11.422 --> 07:13.957
to keep you from refueling
and sneaking home

07:13.991 --> 07:16.002
with the vaccine
in your pocket.

07:16.138 --> 07:19.835
We have no interest in keeping the
vaccine to ourselves. It's for the world.

07:20.254 --> 07:22.222
Do you know what was going on
in the world

07:22.256 --> 07:24.524
while you were playing
your war games in the Arctic?

07:24.592 --> 07:27.561
The virus spread
like an invisible fire,

07:27.595 --> 07:30.297
destroying everything
in its path.

07:30.331 --> 07:32.198
Bodies piled up sky-high.

07:32.266 --> 07:35.936
The fear spread even quicker
than the virus itself--

07:35.970 --> 07:38.204
turned country against country,

07:38.272 --> 07:39.973
brother against brother,

07:40.007 --> 07:42.509
governments
against their own people.

07:42.543 --> 07:45.645
60 million Chinese were murdered
in three days

07:45.680 --> 07:50.250
like they were culling
so many piglets.

07:50.284 --> 07:52.185
The world...

07:52.219 --> 07:54.688
is not worth saving.

07:54.755 --> 07:59.492
So, what? You want to keep
the vaccine for yourself?

07:59.527 --> 08:01.394
What I want
is of no concern to you.

08:01.429 --> 08:03.530
Well, I don't have it.

08:03.564 --> 08:05.065
Not yet, at least.

08:05.099 --> 08:06.933
And you won't,

08:07.001 --> 08:09.102
because you are missing
an ingredient only I possess.

08:09.170 --> 08:13.006
Now, you will give me
what you have--

08:13.040 --> 08:15.642
the primordial sample,

08:15.676 --> 08:19.245
your research,
and Dr. Scott.

08:19.280 --> 08:24.105
Or you die in Cuba.

08:24.139 --> 08:26.160
You won't fire on my ship
as long as we have what you want.

08:26.541 --> 08:29.810
And this little game of chicken
you're playing right now

08:29.845 --> 08:32.380
will only cause millions
more to die.

08:32.414 --> 08:34.881
So why don't I lead
with my best offer?

08:42.256 --> 08:45.259
A sample of
the primordial virus.

08:50.132 --> 08:52.600
With my compliments.

08:57.706 --> 09:00.341
I'm sorry.
That will not do, not at all.

09:00.375 --> 09:02.643
You heard the Captain, Boris.

09:02.678 --> 09:06.547
You ain't getting
our scientist.

09:08.850 --> 09:11.652
Don't be foolish, Captain.

09:11.687 --> 09:13.521
You cannot win.

09:15.891 --> 09:18.392
I'll go.
I'll go with them.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.561
- I can do what's needed. I'm capable...
- No!

09:20.595 --> 09:26.334
Not him. Dr. Rachel Scott.
She is the one I want.

09:26.401 --> 09:28.302
Well, that's not gonna happen.

09:28.337 --> 09:30.575
I can outlast you
and your band of cowboys.

09:30.643 --> 09:34.479
My ship has enough nuclear fuel
to patrol this harbor

09:34.513 --> 09:36.214
for the next 25 years.

09:37.350 --> 09:39.184
Then you get nothing, Admiral.

09:39.252 --> 09:41.720
And while you're sitting
out there,

09:41.787 --> 09:44.522
you can wonder,
"How am I gonna feed my men

09:44.557 --> 09:47.859
when the Americans have all
the food on the island?"

09:54.634 --> 09:57.636
Viktor.

09:59.472 --> 10:02.173
Drop it!

10:02.208 --> 10:03.475
Aah!

10:09.515 --> 10:12.751
One mouth less to feed.

10:22.412 --> 10:23.913
RMS picked up
over a dozen mines

10:23.947 --> 10:25.648
blocking the only channel
out of here.

10:25.715 --> 10:27.016
We can kill the ones we need,

10:27.050 --> 10:28.851
but not without
making a lot of noise.

10:28.885 --> 10:31.787
You were right.

10:31.821 --> 10:34.957
Ruskov was using the extra time
to strengthen his position.

10:35.025 --> 10:38.027
Well, it's not like we could
just sneak out of the harbor.

10:38.061 --> 10:39.628
Even under cover of night,

10:39.663 --> 10:41.864
we're glowing big and bright
on his radar.

10:41.898 --> 10:43.799
We've got the world's
best fighting machine

10:43.833 --> 10:45.668
and an entire naval base
at our disposal.

10:45.702 --> 10:46.602
Gator, find us a way
out of here.

10:46.636 --> 10:47.870
Lieutenant Green,

10:47.904 --> 10:49.538
I want a tactical plan.
Work with Tex.

10:49.573 --> 10:51.707
He's not Navy, but he knows
the island and he can fight.

10:51.741 --> 10:52.641
We need all hands.

10:52.676 --> 10:53.709
Yes, sir.

11:05.055 --> 11:09.458
Doctor, Admiral Ruskov said
he had something you don't,

11:09.492 --> 11:11.460
something you can't make
the vaccine without.

11:11.494 --> 11:13.529
Any idea what
he was talking about?

11:15.332 --> 11:17.666
He's bluffing.

11:22.939 --> 11:24.807
So, what would you like me
to do now?

11:24.841 --> 11:27.743
Well, you said you were close to
a breakthrough on the vaccine.

11:27.777 --> 11:31.146
Keep working.
That's all that matters.

11:59.576 --> 12:02.511
We're at GQ, and the
Russians are having a party.

12:02.579 --> 12:05.714
They must still keep vodka
on their ships.

12:05.749 --> 12:10.919
You know, I wasn't even supposed
to be on this ship.

12:10.987 --> 12:14.690
I was two days from reporting
to shore duty in Portsmouth.

12:14.724 --> 12:20.396
And some last-minute change of
orders put me on <i> Nathan James.</i>

12:20.430 --> 12:24.033
I guess that
makes you lucky, huh?

12:27.671 --> 12:29.352
I think I found a way
out of here.

12:29.456 --> 12:32.415
Navy used to send frigates
through this canal all the time.

12:32.416 --> 12:34.786
Yeah, they stopped dredging that
a while back.

12:34.794 --> 12:36.895
From what I heard, it's all
gunked up with coral and rock.

12:36.963 --> 12:38.997
Well, that's why the Russians
didn't bother mining it.

12:39.031 --> 12:40.665
It's too shallow for us
to get through.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.100
Well, it's too shallow
for a DDG,

12:42.134 --> 12:43.969
but I could mount some GLMs
on a RIB,

12:44.003 --> 12:45.737
sail through it,
sneak up on their 180,

12:45.771 --> 12:47.472
and launch a few HE grenades
over their stern.

12:47.506 --> 12:49.107
A ship that size,
it's gonna take more than that.

12:49.141 --> 12:51.509
Tex, what kind of assets
are available at Gitmo?

12:51.577 --> 12:53.812
Army's facility has mortars,
vehicle-mounted weapons.

12:53.846 --> 12:55.113
I got the keys to the joint.

12:55.147 --> 12:56.815
Hell, I can get y'all
a Bradley tank.

12:56.882 --> 12:58.583
You get us in,
we'll do the rest.

12:58.618 --> 13:01.886
Before we do anything,
I want that canal scouted.

13:01.921 --> 13:03.121
Ruskov's no fool.

13:03.155 --> 13:04.589
He knows we're gonna be looking

13:04.624 --> 13:05.790
for another way
out of this harbor.

13:05.858 --> 13:06.958
Aye, sir.

13:06.993 --> 13:09.561
If we start here...

13:22.975 --> 13:26.611
<i>This is beautiful.</i>

13:26.679 --> 13:28.546
<i>Reminds me of</i>
<i>my honeymoon video--</i>

13:28.581 --> 13:30.582
<i>at least the footage</i>
<i>I let people see.</i>

13:30.616 --> 13:31.883
Too much information.

13:31.917 --> 13:34.619
Berchem, it's probably
comments like that

13:34.654 --> 13:36.121
that led to your divorce.

13:37.223 --> 13:38.690
Tex, how long to get the guns

13:38.758 --> 13:39.791
from the army
to the top of the hill?

13:39.859 --> 13:41.760
- A couple hours, Cap'n.
- Good.

13:41.794 --> 13:44.863
<i>It's not deep, but the canal</i>
<i>looks better than we thought.</i>

13:44.897 --> 13:47.766
<i>Only real problem is that</i>
<i>outcropping, probably coral.</i>

13:47.800 --> 13:49.768
<i>It may give us a tight squeeze.</i>

13:49.802 --> 13:52.837
<i>Yeah, we'll have to blow</i>
<i>the coral to get a clean path.</i>

13:52.872 --> 13:55.206
<i>Hang on.</i>
<i>I'll take you to the surface.</i>

13:58.778 --> 14:02.080
<i>We can blow it, but it'll make</i>
<i>a hell of a boom.</i>

14:03.249 --> 14:05.684
<i>- Contact!</i>
<i>- Dive! Dive!</i>

14:05.718 --> 14:08.586
No.

14:08.621 --> 14:10.055
No! No!

14:15.227 --> 14:16.494
Berchem! Smith!

14:16.529 --> 14:19.064
Berchem, come in!
Berchem!

14:22.101 --> 14:24.669
Berchem, come in.

14:24.704 --> 14:27.939
Berchem!

14:27.973 --> 14:29.207
Smith!

14:45.057 --> 14:46.357
Ruskov!

14:46.391 --> 14:49.994
Have you reconsidered my offer?

14:50.028 --> 14:52.530
Look out your window,
starboard side.

15:01.340 --> 15:03.341
Put 'em in the drink.

15:03.376 --> 15:04.943
TAO, Bridge.

15:04.977 --> 15:07.011
One round,
ten yards off the bow.

15:07.079 --> 15:08.780
- TAO, aye. Break, Surface.
- Surface, aye.

15:08.814 --> 15:11.800
Killing track 81652 with guns,

15:11.835 --> 15:15.065
10 yard forward offset,
one round H-E-P-D.

15:22.345 --> 15:23.612
<i>Consider that a warning,</i>

15:23.646 --> 15:25.680
which is more than you gave
to my men.

15:25.715 --> 15:27.282
Next time, I won't miss.

15:30.286 --> 15:32.888
I am disappointed in you,
Captain.

15:32.955 --> 15:35.757
You're not the leader
I imagined.

15:35.791 --> 15:38.693
_

15:38.694 --> 15:45.707
_

15:45.708 --> 15:48.746
_

15:52.575 --> 15:54.776
I will sink you.

15:54.810 --> 15:56.778
This is an Arleigh Burke
destroyer.

15:56.812 --> 15:59.314
It was built to fight.
You'd better know how.

16:02.051 --> 16:03.818
CIC, this is your Captain.

16:03.853 --> 16:06.054
<i>Prepare to fire again</i>
<i>on my order.</i>

16:06.088 --> 16:07.989
<i>This time, I want a direct hit.</i>

16:08.023 --> 16:09.691
Guns, Surface.

16:09.725 --> 16:10.925
Cover track 85150 with guns.

16:12.728 --> 16:13.761
5...

16:15.931 --> 16:17.357
<i>4...</i>

16:17.462 --> 16:19.999
Guns, aye. Cover track 85150.
Target acquired.

16:23.064 --> 16:24.899
3...

16:24.933 --> 16:27.501
2...

16:29.104 --> 16:30.204
1...

16:30.238 --> 16:31.872
What do you want?

16:40.649 --> 16:42.850
Shut your weapons down.

16:42.884 --> 16:46.020
<i>Back out of the harbor</i>
<i>and over the horizon.</i>

16:46.087 --> 16:47.655
I don't want to see
your ugly-ass ship

16:47.689 --> 16:49.056
out of my front window.

16:52.227 --> 16:53.961
Very well.

16:53.995 --> 16:57.865
<i>You have 24 hours</i>
<i>to turn over the doctor.</i>

16:57.899 --> 16:59.900
<i>If you attempt to leave</i>
<i>or are planning</i>

16:59.935 --> 17:03.704
another brilliant sneak attack,
we will see you.

17:03.738 --> 17:04.939
24 hours, Captain.

17:06.675 --> 17:08.142
CIC, XO.

17:08.209 --> 17:10.778
<i>Cease track.</i>
<i>Train mount 5-1 to ready air.</i>

17:12.279 --> 17:15.323
_

17:15.817 --> 17:17.984
We should have blown them
out of the water.

17:24.893 --> 17:27.094
Soon as they're over
the horizon,

17:27.127 --> 17:30.698
send a search and recovery team
for Smith and Berchem.

17:30.732 --> 17:32.933
They're standing by.

17:45.328 --> 17:47.064
_

17:47.065 --> 17:50.086
_

17:55.090 --> 17:57.324
This new thermal cycler
is a godsend.

17:57.392 --> 18:00.194
We'll absolutely be able
to identify the gene.

18:00.228 --> 18:02.930
How's it coming
with that centrifuge?

18:02.964 --> 18:06.033
I was worried that the humidity
on the isla--

18:06.067 --> 18:09.837
- Quincy, what are you doing?
- I need you to come with me now.

18:11.773 --> 18:14.041
- What are you--
- Just go! Move!

18:14.075 --> 18:16.043
Why are you doing this?!

18:16.077 --> 18:18.946
Get down the stairs.
Now move!

18:18.980 --> 18:22.149
Quincy, have you gone insane?

18:22.183 --> 18:23.250
What is it that you want?

18:23.284 --> 18:24.752
Getting off this ship.
Now shut up!

18:24.819 --> 18:26.887
Quincy, you'll destroy
all the samples!

18:26.921 --> 18:28.722
I said shut up!

18:28.757 --> 18:30.724
Now jump.

18:33.762 --> 18:35.262
You've got to be kidding.

18:35.296 --> 18:37.064
Rachel,
I don't want to hurt you,

18:37.098 --> 18:38.932
but that's exactly what will
happen if you don't do as I say.

18:38.967 --> 18:41.635
Now jump.

18:41.669 --> 18:43.103
Hey!
What are you doing?!

19:00.722 --> 19:02.089
He's got a gun!

19:02.123 --> 19:03.991
Nobody move!
Nobody move!

19:04.025 --> 19:05.292
- Quincy!
- Hands up!

19:05.326 --> 19:06.927
- Stay back!
- Don't shoot!

19:06.961 --> 19:08.362
- Stay back!
- Drop your weapon!

19:08.396 --> 19:10.064
- Stay back!
- Drop the weapon!

19:10.131 --> 19:11.832
Don't shoot him!

19:11.866 --> 19:14.735
Quincy.

19:18.807 --> 19:22.409
Okay.

19:22.444 --> 19:24.244
Okay.

19:35.023 --> 19:35.789
Quincy, no!

19:35.824 --> 19:37.791
If I open this,

19:37.826 --> 19:40.327
the virus will kill everybody
on the ship!

19:40.361 --> 19:42.963
So put your weapons down
and back away!

19:43.031 --> 19:44.865
Look, Doctor.
I don't know why you did this,

19:44.899 --> 19:46.233
but I know
we can talk this through.

19:46.267 --> 19:48.068
We solve problems.
That's what we do.

19:50.071 --> 19:52.806
Rachel,
you have to come with me.

19:52.841 --> 19:55.342
It's you they want.

19:55.376 --> 19:56.777
Just you.

19:58.246 --> 20:01.381
I'm not going anywhere.

20:01.416 --> 20:03.750
You're gonna have
to kill me, too.

20:06.254 --> 20:08.188
Put your weapons down.

20:08.256 --> 20:09.223
Stay back!

20:12.460 --> 20:15.028
Give me the vial, Quincy.

20:15.063 --> 20:18.732
Rachel, they're not
gonna hurt you.

20:18.766 --> 20:20.968
They promised me.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.169
So, please...

20:22.203 --> 20:25.005
Please come with me.

20:25.073 --> 20:28.041
You're not gonna kill
all these people.

20:30.211 --> 20:32.779
It's not who you are.

20:38.486 --> 20:40.187
Give me the vial?

20:53.334 --> 20:55.469
Please.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.202
He must have been talking
to the Russians all along.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.171
That's how they were able
to follow us.

21:21.205 --> 21:23.807
I mean, he was my partner
for almost 10 years.

21:23.841 --> 21:25.875
I'm at a complete loss!

21:25.943 --> 21:27.944
What were his connections
to the Russians?

21:27.978 --> 21:29.212
I don't know.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.880
I mean, he studied there
years ago.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.982
He has friends, he has
colleagues-- We both do.

21:33.050 --> 21:36.619
It doesn't make sense.

21:36.687 --> 21:38.955
I told you, I hadn't met him,
not until yesterday!

21:38.989 --> 21:42.058
So, what were you two,
like, Facebook friends?

21:42.093 --> 21:44.961
I need to see the Captain.
My family is in grave danger.

21:44.995 --> 21:46.496
Yeah, we'll get to that.

21:46.564 --> 21:47.230
First you're gonna tell me
about your relationship

21:47.298 --> 21:49.733
- with the Admiral.
- There is no relationship.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.568
There never was a relationship!

21:51.602 --> 21:53.937
Please, my daughter is
a prisoner on his ship!

21:53.971 --> 21:57.006
You almost killed
my entire crew,

21:57.041 --> 22:00.043
so I recommend
you start talking.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.112
It wasn't supposed to happen
like this.

22:07.051 --> 22:10.086
During the hysteria
of the outbreak,

22:10.154 --> 22:12.555
governments were pressuring
their biologists

22:12.590 --> 22:14.724
to deliberately withhold
vital information,

22:14.759 --> 22:17.227
research that could possibly
contribute to a vaccine.

22:17.294 --> 22:19.095
I disagreed.

22:19.130 --> 22:22.999
And I began sharing information
with another scientist,

22:23.033 --> 22:24.300
Sergei Yumanov.

22:24.335 --> 22:25.802
Sharing?
You mean leaking.

22:25.870 --> 22:27.237
You don't understand!

22:27.271 --> 22:28.972
While governments bickered
amongst themselves,

22:29.006 --> 22:31.074
the virus was winning!
I couldn't let that happen!

22:31.108 --> 22:35.078
Ruskov suggested he had someone
or something on his ship

22:35.112 --> 22:37.280
to help him make a vaccine.
Is that your friend?

22:37.314 --> 22:39.249
Sergei's dead.

22:39.283 --> 22:43.119
I'd been communicating with him
on the sat phone.

22:43.154 --> 22:47.791
Then two weeks before the
Russians attacked us on the ice,

22:47.825 --> 22:49.125
I called Sergei,

22:49.160 --> 22:51.861
and it was Ruskov
on the end of the line.

22:51.896 --> 22:54.631
He'd murdered Sergei

22:54.665 --> 22:56.800
and taken my family--

22:56.834 --> 22:58.268
my daughter and my wife.

22:58.302 --> 23:00.837
It was a Brit that kept us
in the harbor

23:00.871 --> 23:03.706
by pretending to be CO
of that UK destroyer.

23:03.741 --> 23:04.908
Quite a performance
by your wife.

23:04.975 --> 23:06.810
Kelly had nothing to do
with this.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.379
Ruskov is using her
to get to me

23:09.413 --> 23:10.880
and, more importantly, Rachel.

23:10.915 --> 23:12.882
Listen.

23:12.917 --> 23:16.853
I did a stupid, stupid thing.
Do what you want with me,

23:16.887 --> 23:19.856
but please don't make my family
pay for my mistakes.

23:19.890 --> 23:23.259
Ruskov will kill them
if I don't do as he says.

23:23.294 --> 23:24.994
What exactly
was your plan tonight?

23:25.029 --> 23:29.644
I was supposed to take Rachel
and the samples

23:29.679 --> 23:31.085
to the other side of the beach.

23:31.120 --> 23:34.601
There's a boat I can use
to get us to the <i> Vyerni.</i>

23:54.225 --> 23:57.827
Who am I impersonating
at this godforsaken hour,

23:57.862 --> 23:59.662
the Queen of England?

23:59.697 --> 24:01.865
No, your work is done,
duschenka.

24:01.899 --> 24:06.269
Now it's up to your husband,
and we will see.

24:06.303 --> 24:10.106
See... what?

24:10.140 --> 24:13.743
If he loves his family
as much as you say.

24:20.718 --> 24:24.721
I must admit, I have mixed
feelings about his success.

24:24.755 --> 24:28.892
I've come to enjoy
our time together.

24:34.265 --> 24:36.065
The Russians
are expecting Quincy

24:36.100 --> 24:38.268
to show up with Dr. Scott
on the civilian vessel

24:38.302 --> 24:40.270
some time tonight
while there's no moon.

24:40.304 --> 24:42.138
The meeting will go off
as planned

24:42.172 --> 24:43.973
with a few important
differences.

24:44.008 --> 24:45.742
Sir, unless we completely
cripple the <i> Vyerni,</i>

24:45.776 --> 24:47.110
he'll still have
retaliatory capability.

24:47.177 --> 24:50.013
By then, we'll be safely
out of the harbor.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.416
Smith and Berchem
didn't die in vain.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.152
They showed us we can make our
escape through the old canal.

24:56.186 --> 24:58.988
Sir, forgive me, but it's one
thing to send a RHIB through.

24:59.056 --> 25:01.291
This is a destroyer.
The water's not deep enough.

25:01.325 --> 25:02.759
It's not possible.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.227
Exactly why the Russians
won't expect it.

25:04.261 --> 25:06.763
At high tide, we'll have
two, three feet clearance.

25:08.999 --> 25:11.301
That canal is so narrow,

25:11.335 --> 25:12.702
we won't have any margin
for error.

25:12.770 --> 25:14.771
And then there's
the coral growth.

25:14.805 --> 25:16.039
It'll rip our hull apart.

25:16.073 --> 25:17.473
So we blast ourselves a hole.

25:17.541 --> 25:19.075
But, sir, the minute
we move the ship,

25:19.143 --> 25:20.343
Ruskov will see us
on his radar.

25:20.377 --> 25:21.744
He's staring right at us.

25:21.779 --> 25:23.046
He's not looking at us.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.114
He's looking at a red dot
on a radar screen.

25:25.182 --> 25:27.450
On that screen, we could be
any ship in this port.

25:30.187 --> 25:32.188
Let's prepare the Bridge Team.

25:36.827 --> 25:39.128
Lieutenant Foster.

25:39.163 --> 25:41.197
We need a female
for this mission.

25:41.265 --> 25:44.233
You grew up on a farm.
Can you still handle a rifle?

25:44.268 --> 25:48.137
Qualified as expert marksman
last year.

25:48.205 --> 25:50.807
I can knock the nipples
off a chicken

25:50.841 --> 25:52.442
from a thousand yards, sir.

25:52.476 --> 25:55.411
Okay, you're on Alpha Team
with Rowler.

25:55.446 --> 25:56.512
Yes, sir.

26:00.918 --> 26:01.985
Sir?

26:02.019 --> 26:03.286
I don't feel comfortable

26:03.320 --> 26:05.822
having Lieutenant Foster
on this mission.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.191
She's never seen action
like this before.

26:08.225 --> 26:09.826
Objection noted, Lieutenant.

26:09.860 --> 26:13.333
- She's going.
- Then I'm riding Alpha.

26:15.366 --> 26:17.200
Sir, I've...

26:17.267 --> 26:21.204
I've already lost two men while
standing on the sidelines.

26:21.238 --> 26:24.474
Search Team couldn't even
recover their bodies.

26:24.508 --> 26:26.476
I need to be out there
this time.

26:28.379 --> 26:31.214
Thank you, sir.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.372
High tide in exactly
2 hours and 48 minutes.

26:47.407 --> 26:50.709
We're gonna take this ship
through the eye of the needle.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.344
To avoid Russian radar,

26:52.378 --> 26:54.746
we're gonna do it
at EMCON Alpha 1--

26:54.781 --> 26:58.050
no sonar, no radar.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.052
But we're up to the challenge.

27:02.622 --> 27:04.623
Yes, sir!

27:04.691 --> 27:07.259
- Let's get the low-vis watch
team on the bow. - Sir.

27:10.096 --> 27:13.031
Sir, without radar,
we're gonna be awfully close

27:13.099 --> 27:15.500
to that coral
in order to hit the mark.

27:15.535 --> 27:17.502
We won't get a second chance.

27:17.537 --> 27:19.738
We'll just have to get it right
the first time.

27:21.241 --> 27:23.375
Aye, sir.

27:26.964 --> 27:29.925
_

27:30.045 --> 27:38.458
_

27:38.547 --> 27:43.764
_

27:43.865 --> 27:49.933
_

28:05.084 --> 28:07.419
Just keep your head down!

28:07.453 --> 28:10.255
Keeping my head down's kinda
gonna defeat the purpose,

28:10.323 --> 28:11.256
don't you think?

28:20.466 --> 28:21.366
We're good to go.

28:21.401 --> 28:22.634
Next radio click comes

28:22.669 --> 28:24.202
when they're 500 yards
from impact zone.

28:24.237 --> 28:25.771
Single up.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.307
When the Master Chief's back
on board, take in all lines.

28:28.341 --> 28:29.808
Everyone watch the clock.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.576
We're timing this
down to the second.

28:31.611 --> 28:33.445
Aye, sir.

28:36.149 --> 28:37.816
Last time I navigated
by dead reckoning

28:37.850 --> 28:39.618
was the sailing team
at the academy.

28:39.652 --> 28:42.187
I'm more nervous about being
blown out of the water.

28:42.221 --> 28:45.791
On the bright side,
with our radar turned off,

28:45.825 --> 28:47.693
we won't see it coming.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.711
All right, Miller.
Find a spot right here.

29:05.745 --> 29:07.379
All right.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.317
I don't mean to sound dim, sir,

29:12.352 --> 29:14.286
but how's a roll
of aluminum foil

29:14.320 --> 29:16.555
supposed to look like
a 500-foot destroyer?

29:16.589 --> 29:18.557
It's all about reflections,
my man.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.325
The <i> James</i> has low reflectivity,

29:20.360 --> 29:22.227
which makes us hard
to pick up on radar.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.528
In fact, to the Russians,

29:23.563 --> 29:26.431
we look just about the same
as a few square feet

29:26.466 --> 29:29.701
of tin foil,
pointed in the right direction.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.842
Master Chief, you about ready?

29:36.876 --> 29:38.643
Yes, sir.
On your order.

29:44.183 --> 29:45.917
Prepare to go EMCON Alpha 1.

29:45.952 --> 29:50.222
<i>I say again, all radar</i>
<i>and radio transmissions</i>

29:50.256 --> 29:51.423
<i>go down on my count.</i>

29:56.429 --> 29:58.296
3...

29:58.364 --> 29:59.631
2...

30:04.303 --> 30:05.570
1...

30:05.605 --> 30:06.438
now!

30:32.665 --> 30:34.633
Sir, all crew back on board.

30:34.667 --> 30:37.836
Lieutenant Granderson,
all ahead 1/3, 3 knots.

30:37.870 --> 30:41.206
Make your course 1-3-5.
Engage prairie masker.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.441
Aye, sir.

30:42.475 --> 30:44.276
Helmsman,
come to course 1-3-5,

30:44.310 --> 30:45.610
all ahead 1/3 for 3 knots.

30:45.645 --> 30:47.946
Course 1-3-5,
all ahead 1/3 for 3 knots.

30:47.980 --> 30:48.747
Aye.

30:59.492 --> 31:01.726
Time to disappear.

31:16.430 --> 31:18.964
St. Nicholas point channel
light 2-6-2.

31:18.999 --> 31:21.701
St. Nicholas point channel
light 2-6-2.

31:21.735 --> 31:24.403
Corinaso point light 1-9-0.

31:24.438 --> 31:26.405
Corinaso point light
1-9-0, aye.

31:26.440 --> 31:27.707
Gator, I need a report.

31:27.741 --> 31:29.975
Speed over ground 4.6 knots.

31:30.043 --> 31:31.944
Course over ground 112.

31:31.978 --> 31:34.513
I hold you at 50 yards
right of track,

31:34.548 --> 31:36.916
recommend course 1-0-7
to regain track.

31:36.983 --> 31:38.751
Recommended course 1-0-7,
aye.

31:38.819 --> 31:40.886
Helmsman come to left
to course 1-0-7.

31:40.921 --> 31:43.556
My rudder is left,
coming to new course 1-0-7.

31:48.562 --> 31:49.829
What's our depth, Gator?

31:49.863 --> 31:51.864
Four feet clearance
beneath the sonar dome.

31:51.898 --> 31:52.898
To a rocky bottom.

31:52.933 --> 31:54.033
If we're on track,

31:54.067 --> 31:55.801
we should be hearing from them.

31:58.071 --> 31:59.572
That's it.
They're in open water,

31:59.639 --> 32:01.507
500 yards out, 10 knots.

32:01.541 --> 32:02.808
Calculated impact
in five minutes.

32:02.843 --> 32:05.010
We don't blast the coral

32:05.045 --> 32:07.580
until Green and Foster
have reached their target.

32:07.614 --> 32:09.048
We wait until
we see their blast.

32:09.082 --> 32:10.015
Is that clear?

32:10.083 --> 32:12.651
Aye, sir.

32:16.378 --> 32:19.853
_

32:48.688 --> 32:50.589
Ruskov should see them by now.

32:50.657 --> 32:52.358
Let's hope he buys it.

32:52.392 --> 32:54.760
He already thinks he's won.

33:01.467 --> 33:04.386
_

33:07.074 --> 33:08.474
_

33:20.487 --> 33:21.787
We're hot!

33:25.559 --> 33:27.927
Here we go.

33:38.503 --> 33:41.258
_

33:41.259 --> 33:43.836
_

33:45.712 --> 33:47.580
I have the reef visually

33:47.614 --> 33:49.882
at about 800 yards
off the port bow.

33:51.952 --> 33:53.152
OOD, based on a good fix,

33:53.186 --> 33:54.753
holds us at 20 yards
left of track.

33:54.821 --> 33:56.655
Helmsman, come right
five degrees rudder.

33:56.690 --> 33:58.090
Right five degrees rudder, aye.

34:02.529 --> 34:04.563
TAO, I'm gonna need
to blast that coral.

34:04.598 --> 34:05.631
What's your status?

34:05.665 --> 34:07.066
<i>Torpedo is armed and ready.</i>

34:07.100 --> 34:09.635
<i>Firing bearing set.</i>

34:26.518 --> 34:27.620
What are you doing?

34:27.654 --> 34:30.255
Just bail!
I got this!

34:30.290 --> 34:31.991
Danny, not yet!
We're gonna be late!

34:32.025 --> 34:33.592
Speed up!

34:34.661 --> 34:35.661
Something happened.

34:35.661 --> 34:37.862
Impact is overdue, sir.

34:37.898 --> 34:39.764
Why aren't we seeing anything?
Where are they?

34:39.799 --> 34:41.100
Hang on.

34:41.134 --> 34:43.168
Sir, that canal is too tight
to turn around in.

34:43.235 --> 34:44.837
I can't slow down without
losing maneuverability.

34:44.905 --> 34:47.806
We have to blast that coral,
sir, or it'll tear us apart!

34:47.841 --> 34:49.208
Hang on.

34:49.275 --> 34:50.609
You can just bail!

34:50.643 --> 34:51.643
I'm not going anywhere!

34:51.678 --> 34:52.777
We got to go!

35:03.288 --> 35:04.690
Come on.

35:06.960 --> 35:09.628
We're gonna hit the coral
in 15 seconds.

35:09.663 --> 35:10.963
Hang on.

35:16.236 --> 35:17.703
Admiral?

35:17.704 --> 35:20.441
_

35:27.691 --> 35:29.517
_

35:29.916 --> 35:32.284
_

35:32.319 --> 35:33.986
10 seconds, sir.

35:39.125 --> 35:41.046
Come on.

35:56.042 --> 35:57.763
Chyort!

35:59.145 --> 36:00.879
Aah!

36:04.718 --> 36:06.251
Fire torpedoes!

37:08.114 --> 37:11.016
DC Central, Captain.
Damage report.

37:11.051 --> 37:15.354
<i>Bridge, DC Central.</i>
<i>Initial report...</i>

37:15.388 --> 37:17.756
<i>no apparent hull damage.</i>

37:24.364 --> 37:26.899
OOD, let's pick up our cargo
and get the hell out of here.

37:26.933 --> 37:29.068
Aye, sir.
All engines ahead 2/3.

37:29.102 --> 37:30.903
Rescue boat moving to extract.

37:37.203 --> 37:42.382
_

37:42.383 --> 37:46.490
_

37:48.522 --> 37:49.806
_

37:51.840 --> 37:54.834
_

37:55.995 --> 37:57.396
Nice work, Lieutenant.

38:02.769 --> 38:03.836
Danny.

38:03.870 --> 38:05.104
We were late.

38:05.138 --> 38:06.805
I could have blown
the whole mission

38:06.873 --> 38:09.074
and gotten all of us killed,
the whole crew.

38:09.109 --> 38:11.009
But you didn't.
And we got out fine.

38:11.077 --> 38:13.112
I lost my focus because of you.

38:13.146 --> 38:14.079
Because of me?

38:14.114 --> 38:16.081
I didn't do anything.

38:16.116 --> 38:17.316
You throttled down
and wanted me to bail.

38:17.350 --> 38:19.485
- No.
- Danny.

38:19.519 --> 38:23.322
This is-- This is why
we're not supposed to...

38:32.031 --> 38:33.866
I love you.

38:36.402 --> 38:38.504
Just stay away from me.

39:07.233 --> 39:10.869
Did Ruskov have a backup plan?

39:10.904 --> 39:13.839
In case you couldn't get
Dr. Scott off the ship?

39:13.873 --> 39:17.809
I haven't the faintest idea.

39:20.914 --> 39:22.114
So, that's it, then?

39:23.316 --> 39:25.484
They're dead.

39:25.518 --> 39:27.553
You killed my family.

39:27.587 --> 39:29.555
No,<i> you</i> killed your family!

39:29.589 --> 39:31.390
You killed them,
and two of my best men

39:31.424 --> 39:33.058
the minute you took up
with Ruskov!

39:33.092 --> 39:34.092
I had no choice!

39:34.127 --> 39:35.194
You always have a choice!

39:35.228 --> 39:37.396
You could have asked for help!

39:37.430 --> 39:39.965
Instead, you took the fate
of the entire world

39:39.999 --> 39:42.301
in your hands,
and you almost threw it away!

39:42.335 --> 39:43.869
And what would you have done?

39:43.937 --> 39:46.872
If it were your family
on Ruskov's ship,

39:46.906 --> 39:48.807
what would you have done?!

39:53.846 --> 39:57.115
Answer me!
What would you have done?!

40:06.426 --> 40:08.827
This is ridiculous.

40:08.861 --> 40:11.396
Come on.
I can't believe this.

40:11.431 --> 40:14.132
Ah, damn it!

40:14.167 --> 40:15.267
Damn it!

40:15.301 --> 40:16.535
Elva!

40:17.870 --> 40:19.338
Elva, this is ridiculous.

40:23.142 --> 40:24.509
You didn't get her, did you?

40:24.544 --> 40:26.278
No.

40:29.315 --> 40:31.516
I thought we were all dead.

40:31.551 --> 40:33.852
How bad is the ship?

40:33.886 --> 40:35.354
We'll fix it.

40:35.388 --> 40:37.122
Yeah, well...

40:37.156 --> 40:39.524
I mean, I need that woman,
and I need the primordial.

40:39.559 --> 40:42.160
We'll get her and the virus,
I assure you.

40:44.063 --> 40:45.397
No. Damn it!

40:45.431 --> 40:48.267
Do I need to send someone in

40:48.301 --> 40:50.002
to help you...
clean up?

40:50.036 --> 40:53.038
No, please.
I'll do it.

40:53.072 --> 40:55.440
Ah!

40:55.475 --> 40:57.476
I hate how your men look at me.

40:57.510 --> 41:01.579
Like I'm some sort
of circus attraction.

41:10.278 --> 41:12.667
Oh, I'm still waiting
on that microwave oven!

41:12.668 --> 41:14.147
I need mice!
