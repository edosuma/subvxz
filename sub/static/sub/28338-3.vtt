09:34.540 --> 09:36.460
for a wonderful evening.

09:36.460 --> 09:39.290
Unfortunately,
I must be going now.

09:41.670 --> 09:43.080
River.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.080
Yes, dear!

09:45.080 --> 09:46.920
I never liked you.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.710
[panting]

09:48.710 --> 09:51.790
Uh, he was talking
about the broccoli.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.540
Whoa whoa whoa, Mom!

09:55.540 --> 09:57.880
Wait! Where are you going?

09:57.880 --> 10:00.670
Your father and I
are going to take off.

10:00.670 --> 10:02.500
Oh, it was the Globgor
thing, wasn't it?

10:02.500 --> 10:04.460
Ugh! I know I should've
told you earlier.

10:04.460 --> 10:08.290
No, it's not Globgor.
It's Eclipsa.

10:08.290 --> 10:10.880
What? You guys
looked like buds.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.580
You were jamming back there.

10:12.580 --> 10:14.790
I don't trust her.

10:14.790 --> 10:17.960
I guess
you don't think I made
the right decision then.

10:17.960 --> 10:21.290
Look, you were queen,
and you made a decision.

10:21.290 --> 10:23.420
I may not think
it was the right decision,

10:23.420 --> 10:25.420
but that doesn't matter.

10:25.420 --> 10:28.420
Well, so what're
you gonna do?

10:28.420 --> 10:30.290
Your dad and I need
some time alone together,

10:30.290 --> 10:35.500
and he wants to build
something called
a... yurt?

10:35.500 --> 10:36.500
A what?

10:36.500 --> 10:37.880
A yurt, my dear.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.420
It's like a tent,
but round!

10:39.420 --> 10:41.120
I got the plans
right here.

10:41.120 --> 10:44.040
I'm going to use my saliva
to bind the logs together.

10:44.040 --> 10:46.040
That... doesn't sound safe.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.460
Yes, it sounds
pretty dangerous.

10:48.460 --> 10:50.380
Sure you don't
want to come with us?

10:50.380 --> 10:52.000
I feel like I gotta
stay here

10:52.000 --> 10:55.620
and help Eclipsa
figure this out.

10:55.620 --> 10:57.830
I love you, sweetie.

10:57.830 --> 10:59.330
I love you, too.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.580
You okay?

11:06.580 --> 11:08.620
Just kinda feel
so grown up.
