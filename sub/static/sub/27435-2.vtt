WEBVTT

00:05.220 --> 00:07.211
MOREAU: You don't know me.

00:07.310 --> 00:10.529
You may think you do.

00:10.610 --> 00:13.829
You may have heard things,
stories,

00:13.920 --> 00:15.831
about the way I work,

00:15.920 --> 00:17.569
jobs I've done,

00:17.660 --> 00:20.094
and what I'm capable of.

00:20.190 --> 00:22.624
MCMAHON: I know
your reputation,
which is why we hired you.

00:22.710 --> 00:24.758
The incident will appear to be
part of your political agenda.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.841
_No one will know
Its real purpose If
you can get it done.

00:26.930 --> 00:29.194
Everything is on schedule.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.451
I haven't heard from you
in nearly a month.

00:31.550 --> 00:33.893
Not a single word.
I told you,

00:33.990 --> 00:37.858
I couldn't do your job
without making a few changes.

00:37.950 --> 00:40.851
Those changes
have been made.

00:40.950 --> 00:42.986
Target will only be in town
for a day.

00:43.080 --> 00:45.731
He knows about
the coup attempt.
If he tells anyone...

00:45.820 --> 00:48.869
I told you, it's on schedule.
MCMAHON: But you haven't told me how you'll do it.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.689
Will it be
on-SIte?

00:50.780 --> 00:52.566
If so, how do you intend on getting
past security? How will you get out?

00:52.660 --> 00:55.128
Do we have assurances
this won't get back to us?

00:55.220 --> 00:59.395
Are you saying
you want me to call it off?

00:59.490 --> 01:01.799
No, what I'm saying
is that

01:01.880 --> 01:04.485
the fate of an entire country
rests on you doing your job.

01:04.580 --> 01:06.138
MOREAU: So stop talking.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.401
Consider it done.

01:15.510 --> 01:18.411
What is this?
Who are you?

01:18.510 --> 01:21.377
Believe it or not,
I'm you.

01:31.780 --> 01:33.828
Yes, I only need you
to recover the data.

01:33.910 --> 01:36.959
And, no, I already told you.
I can't tell you why.

01:37.050 --> 01:39.917
Buck, did I ask
you questions

01:40.010 --> 01:40.965
when you needed me
to pretend to be
your girlfriend

01:41.050 --> 01:43.701
at the last reunion?

01:43.790 --> 01:46.270
Yes, I...

01:46.360 --> 01:49.090
Yeah, okay, great.
Thank you.

01:49.190 --> 01:51.533
Call me back.

01:51.630 --> 01:53.757
Well?

01:53.850 --> 01:55.272
What did he say?

01:55.370 --> 01:57.065
He asked
a lot of questions.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.890
But can he recover the medical
files Reddington erased,

01:59.980 --> 02:02.119
tell us what he's hiding?
Look, Liz,

02:04.380 --> 02:06.371
I get
that we're on our own

02:06.470 --> 02:08.426
and that Reddington can't
find out what we're doing,

02:08.510 --> 02:10.125
but can you
explain to me again

02:10.210 --> 02:11.859
why we can't just go to
one person in the FBI?

02:11.950 --> 02:13.770
It's too risky.

02:13.870 --> 02:16.646
Because you think
he'll find out?He will.

02:16.740 --> 02:18.298
Anyone
who's ever gotten close

02:18.390 --> 02:19.561
to the truth about
who Reddington was

02:19.660 --> 02:22.083
before he became Reddington
ended up dead.

02:22.180 --> 02:24.045
My husband,
Dr. Koehler.

02:24.140 --> 02:25.437
Ian Garvey.

02:28.230 --> 02:30.278
We can't go to the Bureau,
not yet.

02:30.360 --> 02:31.702
We've got to
stick to the plan

02:31.800 --> 02:33.358
and see if your friend
can restore

02:33.450 --> 02:35.236
the medical files
Reddington erased.

02:41.420 --> 02:42.455
RED: Elizabeth?

02:45.510 --> 02:46.898
Help me pick these up.

02:46.990 --> 02:48.890
You can't
let him in. He can't see me.

02:48.990 --> 02:50.981
No, he can't.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.463
No one else is gonna die.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.164
The friend who wants
to help us
is a really good guy.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.864
We can't let anything happen
to him, please.

02:58.960 --> 03:02.259
Okay. No one.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.667
Bad time?

03:12.750 --> 03:14.968
No.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.096
May we?

03:17.190 --> 03:18.578
Hmm?

03:18.670 --> 03:20.752
As a fugitive
from justice,

03:20.850 --> 03:22.932
I prefer not to linger
in public hallways.

03:23.020 --> 03:25.932
Of course. Come in.

03:26.030 --> 03:26.928
Have you lost weight?

03:27.030 --> 03:29.931
Hmm.
Five pounds.

03:30.030 --> 03:33.989
Oh. Seven pounds
when it's in the morning.

03:35.430 --> 03:37.728
Let me look at you.

03:37.820 --> 03:39.993
Well,
you look fantastic.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.820
Thai chi and spinach
suit you.

03:41.910 --> 03:43.730
I feel
like a different person.

03:43.830 --> 03:46.560
I'm sure you do.

03:48.530 --> 03:51.966
I have news
about the Corsican.

03:52.050 --> 03:54.223
LIZ: According to Reddington,
Moreau wasn't deterred

03:54.320 --> 03:56.129
by the shootout
at Dr. l_<oehler's
operating room

03:56.230 --> 03:58.312
or our near miss
at Reagan National.

03:58.410 --> 04:00.571
Instead, he's reaching out
to arms dealers

04:00.670 --> 04:01.978
about an upcoming job.

04:02.060 --> 04:03.231
What job?
Did he have any details?

04:03.330 --> 04:04.843
Reddington doesn't have any,

04:04.940 --> 04:06.362
but he's reaching out
to his contacts now.

04:06.460 --> 04:08.542
But if he's right
and Moreau is arming up,

04:08.630 --> 04:10.109
that means
he's gomg to work.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.326
Which means _
people are gonna dIe.

04:11.420 --> 04:13.194
What's the latest
on Moreau?

04:13.290 --> 04:15.281
Any hits from the airport
authority or local police?

04:15.380 --> 04:16.688
Well,
we've scoured CCTV feeds,

04:16.770 --> 04:18.772
but he was obviously
avoiding the cameras.

04:18.860 --> 04:19.906
Nothing clearly
shows his face.

04:19.990 --> 04:21.252
So we're hunting
for a killer,

04:21.340 --> 04:22.819
but we have no idea
what he looks like.

04:22.910 --> 04:25.083
Correct, but we do know
that he purchased a ticket

04:25.170 --> 04:27.343
under the name
Dino DiPasquale

04:27.440 --> 04:31.080
and was all set to board
Premium Sky flight number 206
to JFK.

04:31.180 --> 04:33.000
Now, the alias is burned,
but...

04:33.090 --> 04:34.227
He's headed to New York.

04:34.310 --> 04:36.483
No, he's already there.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.229
We put out an alert
on his vehicle,

04:38.320 --> 04:40.880
the one that he stole from
the employee parking
at Reagan.

04:40.970 --> 04:42.278
Port Authority flagged it

04:42.360 --> 04:43.145
passing through
the Holland Tunnel

04:43.230 --> 04:44.367
just after 6:00 pm.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.668
We may not know
who this guy is,

04:46.760 --> 04:49.581
but we know who he was...
A nationalist,

04:49.680 --> 04:52.319
a hit man who
targets globallsm
in all its forms.

04:52.420 --> 04:54.149
NavabL
alert possible targets--

04:54.250 --> 04:56.115
Wall Street,
the media, consulates.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.282
Ressler, Keen,
get to New York.

04:58.380 --> 05:01.554
There's an assassin
in the city, and we need
to find him.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.164
ALBRECHT: I don't know
about the others.

05:03.250 --> 05:04.729
I only know
how it works for me.

05:04.820 --> 05:08.733
The first basement.
Yes, the first basement.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.344
It's a door marked "C2,"
northeast side
of the building.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.567
Once inside,
there's a checkpoint...

05:13.660 --> 05:16.049
I'm not interested
about the first checkpoint.

05:16.140 --> 05:19.917
Tell me about the second one,
where they check your badges.

05:20.010 --> 05:22.478
How do you know that?

05:22.580 --> 05:24.832
Please, why are you asking me
these things?

05:24.930 --> 05:28.058
Talk to me about
the second checkpoint

05:28.150 --> 05:32.325
where they check your badge
and your access code.

05:32.410 --> 05:34.366
How do you know
these things?

05:34.460 --> 05:36.712
The one they sent you
this morning,

05:36.810 --> 05:39.540
I need you
to write it down.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.720
Now.

05:43.250 --> 05:44.376
Now!

05:59.180 --> 06:00.488
You sure?

06:00.570 --> 06:02.652
Yeah.

06:02.750 --> 06:06.049
Now it's time for you
to get into the trunk.

06:06.140 --> 06:07.698
What?

06:07.800 --> 06:10.667
Please, no.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.489
Just...
Wait, quick, quick,

06:12.580 --> 06:13.888
give me your badge.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.469
Now...

06:23.550 --> 06:25.939
Get in the trunk.

06:26.030 --> 06:27.110
Wait, no.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.781
AARON: Are you listening to me?

06:41.870 --> 06:44.430
The network cut my license fee
in half.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.839
I'm paying ICM 10%
off the top,

06:46.920 --> 06:50.139
and now the studio claims
that it's still in deficit?

06:50.230 --> 06:52.698
Yes, I want to sue.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.928
Now.
Yesterday, if possible.

06:58.150 --> 07:00.368
Finally,
people I can trust.

07:00.460 --> 07:03.099
I warned you, Aaron.
How many times?

07:03.200 --> 07:05.851
The arms business is like
Ring Around the Rosie

07:05.940 --> 07:09.023
compared with this business
you call show.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.499
Hand to God, I'd rather
my daughter marry Arafat

07:12.600 --> 07:14.818
than _a network
or studio executive.

07:14.910 --> 07:18.425
At least he paid you the
courtesy of lying
to your face.

07:18.520 --> 07:22.991
I once provided transportation
for a Chinese cobalt magnate

07:23.090 --> 07:26.435
who insisted on funneling
his ill-gotten gains

07:26.530 --> 07:30.000
into a three-picture deal
with Woodman Blake.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.968
Huge hits,
each one bigger
than the last.

07:34.060 --> 07:36.927
Careers were made.
Awards were won.

07:37.020 --> 07:40.626
A single dollar
over a billion in net profits,

07:40.720 --> 07:42.449
and he stood
to double his investment.

07:42.540 --> 07:46.021
The movies grossed
almost $3 billion worldwide.

07:46.110 --> 07:48.499
In anticipation
of his windfall,

07:48.590 --> 07:50.979
my associate purchased
a mansion in Sydney

07:51.070 --> 07:52.890
and a yacht
in Montenegro.

07:52.990 --> 07:54.423
When the studio accountants

07:54.510 --> 07:56.239
were finished
sharpening their pencils,

07:56.340 --> 08:00.208
the net was $999 million
to the crooked penny.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.858
He went into receivership,

08:01.950 --> 08:04.214
and his wife left him
for a talent agent.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.915
Not that
that's gonna happen to you.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.695
I mean, financially,
you're screwed,

08:07.790 --> 08:09.132
but look at
the bright side...

08:09.220 --> 08:11.825
Your wife's dead,
may she rest in peace.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.487
You said you had
a question about Moreau.

08:15.580 --> 08:17.571
Yes, his whereabouts.

08:17.670 --> 08:19.922
I'm told he reached out
to you recently.

08:20.020 --> 08:22.011
Mm, he did, but, um...

08:22.110 --> 08:23.498
Aaron, I wouldn't ask you

08:23.590 --> 08:25.399
to divulge
information about a client

08:25.500 --> 08:26.933
if it weren't urgent.

08:27.020 --> 08:29.580
I appreciate that,
my friend, hmm?

08:29.680 --> 08:31.716
From you,
I have no secrets.

08:31.810 --> 08:34.597
If I knew his whereabouts,
you'd know his whereabouts,

08:34.680 --> 08:35.897
but I don't.

08:35.990 --> 08:37.503
Oh, then how about
the place

08:37.600 --> 08:39.249
where you're sending
the material he ordered?

08:39.340 --> 08:40.944
He didn't order any.

08:41.040 --> 08:45.295
I had a cache of RPGs,
mint condition, no interest.

08:45.390 --> 08:47.563
All he wanted was
a reference for a contractor.

08:47.650 --> 08:49.515
And who was that?

08:49.610 --> 08:52.477
Maxwell Ruddiger.

08:52.570 --> 08:54.618
Name mean anything
to you?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.304
Like a blast
from the past.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.708
Hmm.

09:00.670 --> 09:01.967
RESSLER: If you're
good with it,
I'm good with it.

09:02.060 --> 09:04.187
I already told you,
I'm good with it.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.362
What am I missing?

09:06.450 --> 09:07.849
See, I know you,

09:07.930 --> 09:09.625
and I know there's no way
that you're okay

09:09.720 --> 09:11.415
with Reddington
killing a guy in our custody

09:11.500 --> 09:13.968
so he wouldn't have to
identify that skeleton.

09:14.070 --> 09:16.630
No, you don't want to tell me
what's really going on,

09:16.730 --> 09:18.595
I'm okay with it.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.114
But don't insult me_ _
by saying you're good With It.

09:21.210 --> 09:23.770
Thank you.
For what?

09:23.860 --> 09:25.725
For being okay with it.

09:25.820 --> 09:27.549
What you got for us?

09:27.650 --> 09:29.083
MAN: Charles Albrecht.

09:29.170 --> 09:31.126
He was_a courier
for the Turkish consulate.

09:31.220 --> 09:32.699
When he didn't
show up for work,

09:32.780 --> 09:33.781
the consulate_
reported him missmg.

09:35.220 --> 09:37.211
They were on alert
because we put word out.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.914
Did the consulate say
whether he was in possession

09:39.010 --> 09:41.444
of any privileged
or classified documents?

09:41.530 --> 09:42.872
He was carrying
a diplomatic pouch

09:42.970 --> 09:44.312
that contained
classified information.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.402
Was.

09:46.490 --> 09:47.752
The pouch is missing,
and since the intel
was classified,

09:47.840 --> 09:49.796
the consulate
won't say what it was.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.664
Well, we already know
what it was...

09:51.760 --> 09:53.455
Something Moreau's
willing to kill for.

09:53.540 --> 09:56.714
Even if it was Moreau.
A Turkish courier?

09:56.810 --> 09:59.028
How does that fit into
his nationalist M.O.?

10:00.900 --> 10:02.982
What else
can you tell us?

10:03.080 --> 10:05.548
The diplomatic pouch
wasn't the only thing missing.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.722
His ID. was taken,
too.

10:20.660 --> 10:22.264
ARAM: Okay,
I think we have a problem.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.920
LIZ: Aram, what is it?Okay, it's about Albrecht.

10:25.010 --> 10:27.001
Mr. Cooper spoke to
the ambassador at
the Turkish Embassy,

10:27.100 --> 10:29.091
who confirmed that Albrecht
was headed to a meeting

10:29.190 --> 10:31.886
at... Get this...
The United Nations.

10:31.970 --> 10:34.234
That's how it fits
his MD.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.936
ARAM: All right, UN. Security Police
says Albrecht's badge was swiped

10:37.020 --> 10:39.671
six minutes ago at the first
basement level, entrance C2.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.284
All right, Aram,
coordinate with security,

10:41.370 --> 10:43.156
put that building
on lockdown,

10:43.250 --> 10:44.729
and see if they can't
get a location on that badge.

10:44.810 --> 10:45.765
We're on our way.

10:45.860 --> 10:47.725
Keen.
Elizabeth...

10:47.820 --> 10:50.505
I have news about
the faceless assassm
you seek.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.851
LIZ: He's headed to the UN.

10:51.950 --> 10:53.861
Yes, to deliver a bomb.

10:53.950 --> 10:56.475
A bomb?
You know this because?

10:56.560 --> 10:59.950
The device was purchased
from one Maxwell Ruddiger...

11:00.050 --> 11:02.735
A lush, a scoundrel,
an old friend,

11:02.830 --> 11:05.879
and a consummate tec_hnician
of all things exploswe.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.484
That's why Moreau targeted
the courier.

11:07.570 --> 11:09.094
This was about access.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.316
RESSLER: Moreau simply
needed a way

11:10.400 --> 11:12.356
to get his device
into the building.

11:12.450 --> 11:14.145
LIZ: Well, the badge will get him in, but not the bomb.

11:14.230 --> 11:15.663
They'll scan it at security,
stop it there.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.012
RESSLER: Unless they don't.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.930
Moreau didn't choose
just anybody With
security clearance.

11:20.020 --> 11:23.365
He specifically chose someone
carrying a diplomatic pouch.

11:23.460 --> 11:26.190
LIZ: Which they won't seize
because it's not subject
to search.

11:26.290 --> 11:27.894
Elizabeth, the contraption
you're hunting for

11:27.990 --> 11:29.719
is a binary device

11:29.810 --> 11:32.461
that contains enough
ammonium nitrate and hydrazine

11:32.560 --> 11:34.289
to wipe out the entire
General Assembly

11:34.380 --> 11:36.428
if not take down
the building itself,

11:36.520 --> 11:38.078
and it's volatile.

11:38.170 --> 11:39.899
The slightest bump or jostle

11:40.000 --> 11:41.865
could detonate the thing
without warning.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.564
How do you know this?
I know this because

11:43.650 --> 11:46.392
I'm sitting with the madman
who built the damn thing.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.345
Maxwell Ruddiger
is with you?

11:48.440 --> 11:50.431
We're en route to you
as we speak.

11:50.530 --> 11:52.919
You need to clear
the building,
locate that device,

11:53.010 --> 11:55.137
and find a way
to get us to it,

11:55.230 --> 11:57.790
but do not let anyone near that widowmaker

11:57.890 --> 12:01.018
until I can get Ruddiger
there to undo the devil
he's created.

12:01.110 --> 12:03.362
Understood?
Yes.

12:05.550 --> 12:08.326
Max, perhaps you should
put down the gin and tonics.

12:08.420 --> 12:11.548
You have a job to do,
and you'll need steady hands.

12:11.640 --> 12:16.464
The gin and tonics are exactly
what give me the steady hands.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.334
Better have another.

12:33.660 --> 12:34.649
Crawling

12:36.620 --> 12:38.269
Over your window

12:38.360 --> 12:41.147
You think I'm confused

12:41.230 --> 12:45.269
I'm waiting
for the divergent wasp

12:45.370 --> 12:47.622
To complete
my current ruse

12:49.070 --> 12:50.890
You use
a plate-glass screen

12:53.160 --> 12:56.800
To protect
my chosen target

12:56.900 --> 12:59.892
But there's
an air-pellet hole

12:59.990 --> 13:02.720
I can crawl through to you

13:02.820 --> 13:04.776
Jean Topperwien,
head of security.

13:04.870 --> 13:06.167
Agents Ressler, Keen,
FBI.

13:06.260 --> 13:07.989
You need to evacuate
this building.

13:08.090 --> 13:09.899
We have an evacuation plan,
but there's no guarantee

13:10.000 --> 13:11.820
we won't lose your unsub
in the process.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.171
Well, that's a risk
we're gonna have to take.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.043
You have to
clear this building.

13:14.140 --> 13:15.823
Do you have a location
on Moreau?

13:15.920 --> 13:18.832
MAN: We know where the badge
was last swiped.Take us there, now.

13:18.920 --> 13:22.742
I am the fly, I am the fly,
I am the fly, I am the fly

13:22.840 --> 13:24.398
Fly in the,
fly in the ointment

13:24.490 --> 13:26.230
Attention, all personnel,

13:26.320 --> 13:28.971
this is an emergency.
For your safety,

13:29.060 --> 13:31.972
please immediately locate the nearest
exit. I am the fly, I am the fly

13:32.070 --> 13:34.630
This is not a test.
Fly in the,
fly in the ointment

13:37.990 --> 13:43.724
I am the fly, I am the fly,
I am the fly, I am the fly

13:43.820 --> 13:45.776
Fly in the,
fly in the ointment

13:45.860 --> 13:49.512
Sir! Stop.
Put it down.

13:49.610 --> 13:51.555
Special Agent
Elizabeth Keen, FBI. I am the fly, I am the fly

13:51.650 --> 13:53.436
We have reason to believe
that case contains

13:53.520 --> 13:54.782
an explosive device. I am the fly, I am the fly

13:54.870 --> 13:57.566
I need you
to put it down slowly

13:57.660 --> 13:58.649
and do exactly as I say.
Fly in the,
fly in the ointment

14:02.010 --> 14:04.228
I am the fly

14:09.890 --> 14:12.927
Okay, uh, all right,
I have the feeds up now.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.749
RESSLER:
All right, I'm putting you on
with the head of security now.

14:14.850 --> 14:17.239
MAN OVER INTERCOM: Attention, all personnel...Agent Mojtabai.

14:17.330 --> 14:20.117
Hello_.
Hello, we're holding evacuees
on the north lawn.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.156
I'm trying to get you access
to those feeds now.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.426
Move, move!

14:36.830 --> 14:38.604
MAN OVER INTERCOM: Attention,
all personnel...

14:38.700 --> 14:41.521
My gun, he's...
He 5 got my gun.

14:41.610 --> 14:43.692
Officer down. Repeat,
officer down. North atrium.

14:43.790 --> 14:45.439
Suspect's armed
and on the move.

14:45.530 --> 14:48.055
MAN: Our evacuation protocol
is clear.

14:48.140 --> 14:49.926
I've been authorized
to change it.

14:50.010 --> 14:51.887
The FBI
has no authority here.

14:51.970 --> 14:54.621
Besides, we won't evacuate
emergency personnel...

14:54.710 --> 14:58.100
During an actual emergency.
You need to leave,
including all UN Personnel,

14:58.200 --> 15:03.979
NYPD responders,
NYPD bomb squad,
HDU, everyone.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.549
That_ was _
my superior officer.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.892
The Secretary General
just hung up with Homeland,

15:07.990 --> 15:08.945
and they've requested
we evacuate

15:09.030 --> 15:11.817
all emergency personnel.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.037
Who are you people?

15:14.130 --> 15:16.769
What's going on here?

15:16.870 --> 15:20.124
10-4, we're clear.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.189
This is certainly a first.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.928
Move aside,
and let the man go through

15:37.020 --> 15:38.499
Let the man go through

15:38.580 --> 15:41.367
Move aside,
and let the man go through

15:41.460 --> 15:43.542
Let the man go through

15:43.630 --> 15:45.803
Move aside,
and let the man go through

15:45.900 --> 15:47.765
Let the man go through

15:47.850 --> 15:48.896
Move aside, and let the man go through

15:48.990 --> 15:50.241
ARAM:
Okay, I think I got him.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.376
All right, Aram, talk to me.
Which way?

15:52.470 --> 15:54.813
Let the man go through,
through All right, turn left.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.514
No, right.
No, no, no, your right.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.508
He can't be more than 20 yards
ahead of you, moving west.

16:02.610 --> 16:07.695
If I stole somebody
else's wave to fly up

16:07.790 --> 16:10.782
RUDDIGER: I apologize, it's
probably a silly question...

16:10.880 --> 16:13.656
But why are the police
escorting us, again?

16:13.750 --> 16:16.799
The police and I have a
special kind of relationship.

16:16.880 --> 16:20.099
Yeah, but this,
they treat you like Elvis.

16:20.190 --> 16:24.194
To rise, to rise, to rise
Yes, except the President
gave Elvis a badge,

16:24.280 --> 16:26.805
and I don't
really need one.

16:26.890 --> 16:29.586
Too fat, fat
you must cut lean

16:29.680 --> 16:30.806
You got to take the elevator to the mezzanine

16:30.900 --> 16:33.061
Chump change
Okay, I can't tell.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.116
And it's on, super bon bon
Uh... Come on. Where'd you go?

16:35.210 --> 16:37.508
All right, I, I lost him
on the feed.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.204
Too fat, fat,
you must cut lean I do not have a visual.

16:39.300 --> 16:42.076
You got to take the elevator to the mezzanine

16:42.170 --> 16:45.219
Okay. I just picked him up
again. You're close.

16:45.300 --> 16:46.255
Super bon bon,
super bon bon

16:48.920 --> 16:51.559
Drop the weapon, Moreau.
Don't do this.

16:51.660 --> 16:54.788
You've got bigger problems
than me inside that building.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.575
I'm only worried
about you.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.616
Maybe you should be worried
about my hostage.

17:02.190 --> 17:04.408
You must cut lean

17:04.500 --> 17:07.276
You got to take the elevator to the mezzanineHang on.

17:07.370 --> 17:09.019
Chump change, and it's on, super bon bonHold on. Hold on.

17:09.110 --> 17:10.623
Super bon bon,
super bon bon

17:10.720 --> 17:13.632
Too fat, fat,
you must cut lean

17:13.720 --> 17:15.278
You got to take the elevator to the mezzanineHang on. Hang on.

17:15.380 --> 17:18.110
Chump change, and it's on,
super bon bon

17:18.210 --> 17:19.768
Super bon bon,
super bon bon

17:23.170 --> 17:25.730
LIZ: Your men need to vacate
the premises.

17:34.050 --> 17:36.780
Funny, it's all
so much smaller
than I'd imagined.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.223
A little tacky.

17:39.310 --> 17:40.618
Reminds me of that road trip
we took.

17:40.710 --> 17:41.927
To Memphis.

17:42.010 --> 17:43.921
Yes, exactly, Graceland.

17:44.010 --> 17:46.399
I had the same reaction
at Graceland.

17:46.500 --> 17:51.278
All rather unimpressive,
actually.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.452
It smells
kind of funny.

17:55.810 --> 17:57.937
How much time
before this thing goes off?

17:58.030 --> 18:01.852
I don't have a clue.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.429
Elizabeth, maybe
we should find someone

18:03.510 --> 18:04.636
to get the man a drink.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.473
Tell me
about the perimeter.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.822
We're working with NYPD
to set a line

18:15.920 --> 18:19.139
from Midtown
to the east and 59th
down to 42nd to the south.

18:19.220 --> 18:20.653
Any sightings?
ARAM: Not yet,

18:20.750 --> 18:22.615
but I've got NYPD analyzing
footage of the area

18:22.710 --> 18:24.314
as we speak.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.924
Pull surveillance,
find an image.

18:26.010 --> 18:28.319
I want Moreau's face
on every TV
in the tri-state area.

18:28.410 --> 18:29.752
Any news from Keen?

18:29.840 --> 18:32.149
I'm on my way to her now.

18:35.850 --> 18:37.750
Ahh, honestly,
the suspense.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.499
Shh, quiet.

18:39.590 --> 18:42.320
Do I really need
to be here?

18:42.420 --> 18:44.206
Quiet.

18:46.030 --> 18:47.895
Ugh, I hate needles.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.685
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

18:54.780 --> 18:57.169
I'm going to
smack the lock.

18:57.260 --> 18:59.171
I'm going to
whack it to pieces

18:59.260 --> 19:00.568
and pray
that opens the case

19:00.660 --> 19:03.618
without tripping the secondary
in-line bypass switch.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.656
You're gonna pray?

19:05.750 --> 19:07.786
Okay, I really don't need
to stay for this part.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.313
All of the smacking
and the whacking and...

19:10.490 --> 19:11.798
Are you okay?

19:11.880 --> 19:14.269
What is it?

19:14.370 --> 19:16.361
Oh, okay.

19:16.450 --> 19:19.237
Ruddiger, if there's nothing
else I can do for you,

19:19.330 --> 19:20.103
I think
I'll go exploring.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.883
Wait, wait.

19:21.980 --> 19:23.459
You're gonna leave me here
with him and the bomb?

19:23.550 --> 19:26.451
You can come to the UN.
any day of the week.

19:26.550 --> 19:28.279
For me, this is
once-in-a-lifetime.

19:28.380 --> 19:31.338
The tug of history
and all that.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.519
You should be fine.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.089
Should be?

19:39.170 --> 19:40.296
That's comforting.

20:09.590 --> 20:13.469
Now my bed
don't weigh the same

20:18.730 --> 20:23.087
Change my clothes
and wash my name

20:27.920 --> 20:33.131
Does the well go down
that low?

20:33.230 --> 20:35.186
Oh, my!

20:35.270 --> 20:38.444
Let me breathe,
and I'll let you goOh!

20:43.190 --> 20:47.627
_I knelt down
in desperation

20:47.720 --> 20:52.191
I felt around
for something real

20:52.290 --> 20:56.590
There's a radio station

20:56.690 --> 20:59.773
Playing wrong in my ear

21:02.210 --> 21:05.031
You keep coming alive,
keep coming alive

21:05.130 --> 21:07.690
Keep coming alive,
keep coming alive

21:11.400 --> 21:14.005
You keep coming alive,
keep coming alive

21:14.090 --> 21:17.093
Keep coming alive,
keep coming alive

21:17.180 --> 21:20.661
Mr. Secretary General,
Mr. President,

21:20.750 --> 21:24.663
distinguished members
of the General Assembly...

21:26.760 --> 21:30.719
I come before you
on the 70th anniversary

21:30.810 --> 21:34.371
of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights...

21:34.460 --> 21:36.678
Now my bed don't
weigh the sameHumbled to be the latest

21:36.770 --> 21:41.378
in a long line
of politically questionable,

21:41.470 --> 21:43.722
formerly dashing strong men

21:43.820 --> 21:46.550
to address
this hallowed hall.

21:46.650 --> 21:50.472
Castro, Gadhafi,
and my personal favorite...

21:50.570 --> 21:54.301
Where your cross
and your flowers survive

21:54.400 --> 21:57.267
Ah, Nikita.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.954
You may have helped
the Soviet Union

21:59.050 --> 22:01.223
lose the Cold War...

22:01.320 --> 22:04.266
I knelt down in desperation
But you did it in style.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.409
Today, I want to bring
to your attention

22:07.500 --> 22:09.923
a topic
of great interest to me...

22:10.020 --> 22:11.749
There's a radio station
And I believe to anyone

22:11.850 --> 22:15.365
who cares about
this revered institution...

22:15.460 --> 22:19.544
Playing wrong in my ear
Cary Grant, or, specifically,
his acid trips.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.937
You keep coming alive,
keep coming alive

22:21.030 --> 22:23.590
Moreau?
RESSLER: We lost him.

22:23.690 --> 22:26.909
NYPD's blanketing the city
as we speak.

22:26.990 --> 22:28.776
What is it?

22:28.860 --> 22:31.476
The gel-cap housing is stuck.
I don't think I can remove it.

22:31.560 --> 22:32.515
Keep coming alive,
keep coming aliveWhich means...

22:32.610 --> 22:33.736
I don't know yet.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.479
Here, do me a favor.

22:35.570 --> 22:37.731
Hold this.
Hold what?

22:37.830 --> 22:38.728
Keep coming alive, keep coming aliveThis white wire.

22:38.830 --> 22:41.048
And not the yellow one.

22:41.140 --> 22:42.300
Keep coming alive,
keep coming aliveDon't touch that.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.960
Please.
Steady hands, my friend.

22:45.050 --> 22:48.486
RED: Through five marriages,
numerous lovers,

22:48.580 --> 22:51.447
allegedly both
male and female,

22:51.540 --> 22:55.180
and over 70 films, including
"North by Northwest,"

22:55.280 --> 22:58.841
arguably the greatest work
ever produced here,

22:58.940 --> 23:02.103
he just kept
right on tripping,
and why not?

23:02.200 --> 23:07.069
Before LSD was weighed down
by the countercultural baggage

23:07.160 --> 23:10.459
of Timothy Leary turning on,
tuning in, and dropping out...

23:10.560 --> 23:12.778
Keep coming alive,
keep coming aliveLSD was used

23:12.860 --> 23:14.816
to treat addiction, anxiety,
and depression.

23:19.350 --> 23:21.477
Keep coming alive,
keep coming alive

23:21.570 --> 23:23.265
Keep coming alive,
keep coming alive

23:23.350 --> 23:24.521
Oh, boy.
What do you mean,
"Oh, boy"?

23:24.620 --> 23:27.305
That means
this is not a good thing.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.743
Keep coming alive, keep coming alive Standing here in the heart...

23:29.840 --> 23:33.059
Of an institution
dedicated to diplomacy,

23:33.150 --> 23:35.710
I can say,
from personal experience,

23:35.800 --> 23:40.624
LSD has made me
significantly more
enlightened,

23:40.720 --> 23:44.235
kind, considerate,
and loving,

23:44.330 --> 23:46.855
and if people
are more kind and loving,

23:46.940 --> 23:48.896
then the world will be, too.

23:48.990 --> 23:50.764
Honestly, do you have any idea
what the hell you're doing?

23:50.860 --> 23:53.909
There will be less crime,
fewer acts of terror,

23:53.990 --> 23:57.812
more joy, more diplomacy,
and far more fun.

23:57.910 --> 23:59.423
Ha,ha!

23:59.520 --> 24:01.647
Ha,ha!

24:01.740 --> 24:04.527
Mm!
RED: Cary Grant once said

24:04.610 --> 24:07.693
after a particularly evocative
LSD trip,

24:07.790 --> 24:12.966
"I imagined myself as a giant
penis launching off from Earth

24:13.060 --> 24:15.620
"like a spaceship."
LIZ: We lost Moreau,

24:15.710 --> 24:17.189
but your weird
little German friend did it.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.236
He defused the bomb.

24:19.320 --> 24:21.709
I'm not surprised.
After all, he did build it.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.324
We've notified NYPD.

24:23.410 --> 24:25.230
You got to get out of here
before they arrive.

24:31.290 --> 24:33.599
Does it...

24:33.680 --> 24:36.160
Bother you?
What?

24:36.250 --> 24:40.072
Knowing that a catastrophe at
the United Nations
was averted,

24:40.170 --> 24:43.298
that people's lives were saved
because of you.

24:43.390 --> 24:46.473
That you do...

24:46.570 --> 24:49.130
Good that no one
Will ever know.

24:49.220 --> 24:51.609
Did you know that
Cary Grant's original name

24:51.700 --> 24:54.089
was Archibald Leach?

24:54.180 --> 24:56.182
That he was born
into poverty,

24:56.270 --> 24:58.875
the son of an alcoholic father
and a depressed mother,

24:58.970 --> 25:01.962
and then reinvented himself

25:02.060 --> 25:06.099
as the paragon
of WASP virtue and charm?

25:07.200 --> 25:08.713
Good for you, Archie.

25:08.810 --> 25:12.803
I'm a great fan
of reinvention.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.936
Of keeping your true self
hidden.

25:15.030 --> 25:17.498
Or of becoming
your true self,

25:17.600 --> 25:20.501
even if you have to take on
a new identity to achieve it.

25:30.050 --> 25:33.690
Care to join me and Dembe
and Ruddiger at the
Red Brau Tavern?

25:33.790 --> 25:36.520
Celebrate with a warm pretzel
and a cold beer?

25:36.620 --> 25:39.578
Whatever happened to tai chi
and spinach?

25:39.660 --> 25:43.187
After saving Manhattan,
I feel I deserve a few carbs.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.145
You go.

25:45.230 --> 25:47.926
I got to stay here
and figure out how
to explain this to EOD.

25:48.020 --> 25:49.794
Second thoughts?

25:49.890 --> 25:51.323
LIZ: I just want to talk
about our plan.

25:51.410 --> 25:52.968
What we're doing
is the right thing.

25:53.070 --> 25:54.765
I know.

25:54.850 --> 25:56.158
I do.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.023
It's just, um...

25:59.290 --> 26:01.633
Whoever he is,
he does do a lot of good.

26:01.730 --> 26:04.642
The only thing that you just
said that matters

26:04.730 --> 26:06.595
is "whoever he is."

26:06.690 --> 26:08.385
That's the point,
we don't know,

26:08.470 --> 26:10.609
and this is the only way
we're gonna find out.

26:10.690 --> 26:12.339
But we do know
who he is.

26:12.440 --> 26:15.000
Raymond Reddington.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.558
Not the real one,
the reinvented one.

26:17.660 --> 26:20.265
The one who's been
Raymond Reddington
for 30 years,

26:20.360 --> 26:22.134
longer than anyone else,

26:22.230 --> 26:24.664
and whatever we find out, it's not gonna change that.

26:24.750 --> 26:27.571
This man,
the one we know,

26:27.670 --> 26:30.059
is the concierge
of crime.

26:30.150 --> 26:34.359
A very bad man capable of
an incredible amount of good.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.416
Look, I get it.

26:36.500 --> 26:39.105
I mean, I mean,
I, I don't get it,

26:39.200 --> 26:41.065
but I accept it.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.469
He's part of your life.
He drops by unannounced.

26:43.550 --> 26:45.893
He's like family.

26:45.990 --> 26:50.336
But being like family
isn't family.

26:50.430 --> 26:51.863
We have a plan,

26:51.950 --> 26:53.599
and if we stick to it,
it's gonna work,

26:53.690 --> 26:55.476
but I can't do this
without you.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.606
So what's it gonna be?

26:59.570 --> 27:01.561
Max,
we can fly you tonight,

27:01.660 --> 27:04.356
just as long as we are
back in the hotel in
time for the tennis.

27:04.440 --> 27:08.228
I don't want to miss
a moment of the _women's
doubles, all right?

27:08.320 --> 27:10.447
Go ahead.
I'll meet you inside.

27:10.540 --> 27:13.668
I'll take mine salted.
As if there was
any other way.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.012
Three salted,
two with mustard.

27:16.110 --> 27:18.066
BALDWIN: Excuse me, sir.
Can I help you?

27:18.150 --> 27:20.015
You look lost.

27:20.110 --> 27:23.409
I am, metaphysically,
but aren't_ we all
just a little?

27:23.510 --> 27:25.637
Let me see some ID.

27:25.730 --> 27:29.985
George Murphy,
Senior VP at Fine and Clean.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.241
We sell shower curtains,
curtain rods,

27:32.340 --> 27:34.205
liners, the occasional
soap dish.

27:34.300 --> 27:35.779
What are you looking at?

27:35.870 --> 27:37.826
Is there a problem,
Officer?

27:37.910 --> 27:39.218
Turn around.
Hands on the cart.

27:39.300 --> 27:42.042
You don't want me to do that.
This is my good side.

27:42.130 --> 27:43.859
1085,
officer needs assistance.

27:43.960 --> 27:46.394
Assistance with what?
DeCIding whether to
go salted or unsalted?

27:46.490 --> 27:47.172
I'm not gonna ask you
again.

27:47.270 --> 27:48.965
Fine, salted.

27:49.050 --> 27:50.130
Just don't blame me
for the aneurysm.

27:50.230 --> 27:52.050
Hands on the cart.

27:52.140 --> 27:53.095
Isn't this exactly
the kind of harassment

27:53.190 --> 27:55.408
that makes people
hate the police?

27:55.490 --> 27:58.186
Are you carrying a weapon?
And here I was hoping
to surprise you.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.191
Mr. Murphy, tell me...

28:00.280 --> 28:03.101
What's a curtain-rod
salesman doing carrying
a loaded handgun?

28:03.200 --> 28:06.931
Curtain-rod salesman?
Shower curtains,
mildew-resistant fabrics.

28:07.030 --> 28:09.248
Baldwin, do you have any idea
who this guy is?

28:09.330 --> 28:10.729
I know
he's a Wiseass.

28:10.810 --> 28:12.721
Wiseass?
That's who you think?

28:12.820 --> 28:15.334
This is the most wanted man
in America.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.429
LIZ: Aram, what is it?

28:26.530 --> 28:28.430
He's been arrested.

28:28.530 --> 28:30.225
That's great news.

28:30.310 --> 28:32.574
Great?
Why would you say that?

28:32.660 --> 28:35.527
The guy's a killer.
I know, but, look.

28:35.620 --> 28:37.576
I know theoretically
that I should be happy

28:37.670 --> 28:38.887
that someone who's done
what he's done

28:38.970 --> 28:40.835
has finally been caught,
but I'm not.

28:40.930 --> 28:43.012
I'm sad.

28:43.110 --> 28:45.806
Sad, about Moreau?
Moreau?

28:45.890 --> 28:47.152
You just said
he was arrested.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.196
No.

28:49.290 --> 28:51.372
We haven't found Moreau.
We're still working on that.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.064
Well, then who
are you talking about?

28:53.160 --> 28:54.718
Mr. Reddington.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.242
Mr. Reddington is the one
that's been arrested.

28:56.340 --> 28:59.559
What? When?

28:59.650 --> 29:04.292
Less than an hour ago,
he was, uh, buying a pretzel.

29:04.390 --> 29:05.994
30 years on the run,

29:06.090 --> 29:08.786
and a beat cop
picks him up
at a pretzel cart.

29:08.870 --> 29:11.134
Where is he now?
NYPD is holding him
at the 27th.

29:11.220 --> 29:12.562
Well,
we have to go get him out.

29:12.660 --> 29:14.912
Police precinct,
the most wanted man
in America?

29:15.010 --> 29:17.262
There's no getting him out.
Of course we can.

29:17.360 --> 29:19.351
We... We, the government.
We have an agreement.

29:19.450 --> 29:22.351
Keen,
he's in the system now.

29:22.450 --> 29:23.758
Does Cooper now?

29:23.840 --> 29:26.058
He's in with Panabaker.

29:26.150 --> 29:27.048
She's not gonna
do anything.

29:27.150 --> 29:28.799
Is that what you know
or what you want?

29:28.890 --> 29:31.324
No one wants that.
For Reddington
to get arrested

29:31.420 --> 29:33.194
so we don't have to work
With him anymore?

29:34.590 --> 29:36.194
Go ahead, Keen, say it.

29:36.290 --> 29:38.019
I know it's
What you're thinking.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.634
Thinking what?
That I called it in.

29:40.730 --> 29:42.948
Reddington's whereabouts,
that they arrested him
because of me.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.644
That's crazy.

29:44.730 --> 29:47.290
None of us would betray
Mr. Reddington like that.

29:52.660 --> 29:55.220
I don't believe
you did it,

29:55.310 --> 29:57.961
but I do believe
you're relieved it happened.

29:58.050 --> 30:00.518
Keen, all I do know
is that it's over,

30:00.620 --> 30:02.838
and nothing Cooper says
is gonna change that.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.400
You can't just walk away.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.196
Actually, Harold,
I can't do anything else.

30:12.280 --> 30:14.328
You know the good
this Task Force has done.

30:14.420 --> 30:16.581
Yes, I do, and the bad.

30:16.680 --> 30:19.285
We knew this was a possibility
when we made his deal.

30:19.380 --> 30:21.678
Which is Why the government
lawyers who papered it

30:21.770 --> 30:24.238
were very clear
about What our position
would be if it did.

30:24.340 --> 30:27.468
In the event of Reddington's
arrest, we disavow.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.255
We papered it
five years ago.

30:29.340 --> 30:32.036
Since that time, thanks
to Reddington's blacklist,

30:32.130 --> 30:33.609
this Bureau
has killed or captured

30:33.700 --> 30:35.827
over 100 high-value targets

30:35.920 --> 30:38.138
and saved a tremendous number
of lives in the process.

30:38.220 --> 30:41.519
Harold, I like you,

30:41.620 --> 30:44.487
and I admire the way
you have milked this mad cow,

30:44.580 --> 30:46.445
but you knew from Day One

30:46.540 --> 30:48.667
that the government
would never
publicly acknowledge

30:48.750 --> 30:50.229
having an immunity agreement

30:50.320 --> 30:52.185
with the number-one man
on its most-wanted list.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.793
I'm not asking you
to go public.

30:53.890 --> 30:55.619
He was arrested
in New York.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.063
If you inform
the US. attorney
of the Southern District...

30:58.160 --> 31:00.105
The publicity hound
who wants to run for governor

31:00.200 --> 31:01.588
and, God forbid,
president?

31:01.680 --> 31:05.150
You have any idea how long
she'd sit on that intel?

31:05.250 --> 31:08.162
We'd be in turtle mode
for a month of Sundays.

31:08.250 --> 31:09.808
There must be something
you can do.

31:09.910 --> 31:12.378
There is,
and we are very good at it.

31:12.470 --> 31:14.472
Absolutely nothing.

31:14.560 --> 31:19.122
Cynthia, I know that the
Task Force has crossed lines.

31:19.220 --> 31:21.085
I know that there has been
collateral damage,

31:21.180 --> 31:24.081
that Reddington is a criminal
who someday must answer

31:24.180 --> 31:25.875
for What he has done,
but that day is not today.

31:25.970 --> 31:27.835
Today, because of Reddington,

31:27.920 --> 31:30.923
we stopped a terrorist
from bombing the UN.

31:31.010 --> 31:35.140
You disavow, and, tomorrow,
we may not be so lucky.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.925
And that would be
a tragedy,

31:38.020 --> 31:41.979
but there is nothing
I can do about it.

32:01.700 --> 32:04.476
BALDWIN: One driver's license,

32:04.570 --> 32:07.482
one watch, Rolex.

32:07.570 --> 32:10.130
$2,000 in cash,

32:10.230 --> 32:15.270
no wallet, no credit card,
no keys, no phone.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.759
You travel light.

32:16.840 --> 32:17.829
Trick of the trade.

32:17.930 --> 32:21.457
The soap dish trade.

32:21.540 --> 32:26.022
You know What you fellas
always say, that phrase?

32:26.110 --> 32:29.932
"We can do this the easy way
or the hard way."

32:30.030 --> 32:32.157
Well, that's up to you,
isn't it?

32:32.250 --> 32:35.378
Actually,
it's entirely up to you.

32:35.470 --> 32:38.030
One way or the other,
I'll be set free.

32:38.130 --> 32:41.554
Indictments and trials
are obVIously the hard way.

32:41.650 --> 32:44.471
The easy way is for you
and your family

32:44.570 --> 32:47.607
to suddenly become
grotesquely rich,

32:47.700 --> 32:51.227
buy one of those
offensive mega-yachts,

32:51.310 --> 32:55.519
and _travel the oceans
like a nouveau
Jacques Cousteau.

32:55.620 --> 32:56.928
Is that a bribe?

32:57.010 --> 32:58.966
A statement of fact.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.051
You simply haven't lived

33:01.150 --> 33:03.050
until you've skinny dipped

33:03.150 --> 33:07.234
in the clear blue waters
off the coast of La Ciotat.

33:10.070 --> 33:12.322
_ The ADA
is gonna want a statement.

33:12.420 --> 33:14.285
Hmm.

33:23.820 --> 33:25.162
A phone number.

33:25.260 --> 33:26.602
A pot of gold

33:26.700 --> 33:28.600
waiting at
the end of the rainbow

33:28.700 --> 33:31.863
for anyone smart enough
to make the call.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.182
Let's try that again.

33:53.160 --> 33:56.197
What's this?
My autograph,
and a short dedication.

33:56.290 --> 33:58.201
Something
to make it personal.

33:58.290 --> 34:00.508
If you insist on being
a flatfoot for the
rest of your life,

34:00.600 --> 34:03.376
you should sell it on eBay,
buy some orthotics.

34:08.260 --> 34:10.034
Ah.
We'll take it from here.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.859
Who's "we"?

34:11.960 --> 34:12.949
The prisoner
is now in the custody

34:13.050 --> 34:15.348
of the federal government.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.658
I made the arrest.
You're just gonna take
my collar away from me.

34:17.750 --> 34:20.093
He's facing multiple
outstanding federal
indictments.

34:20.180 --> 34:21.351
That puts us
at the head of the line.

34:21.450 --> 34:23.668
You're a hero,
Officer Baldwin.

34:23.750 --> 34:26.218
I'll be sure to mention your
name at the press conference.

34:28.410 --> 34:30.401
Would've been a nice boat.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.803
Let me be clear.

34:42.900 --> 34:45.812
You will never be free
again.

34:45.900 --> 34:48.039
You'll be tried, convicted,
held in a federal prison

34:48.120 --> 34:51.908
until we execute you.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.513
As pleasant as that sounds,

34:53.610 --> 34:56.511
I'm afraid I've made
other arrangements.

35:01.050 --> 35:02.824
This is gonna be fun.

35:04.970 --> 35:07.313
Winning always is.

35:14.890 --> 35:17.324
Miss Holt.

35:17.410 --> 35:19.458
Harold Cooper.
Hi.

35:19.550 --> 35:22.110
Thank you for coming.
Sure.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.418
When you asked me to
come to your office to
talk about Reddington,

35:24.510 --> 35:25.761
I assumed you meant
the Hoover building.

35:25.860 --> 35:27.725
What is this place?

35:27.820 --> 35:30.459
A blacksite facility for
the Reddington Task Force.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.903
This is Where you've
been hunting him from?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.343
That's What I wanted to
talk with you about.

35:35.430 --> 35:37.421
We haven't been hunting
Reddington...

35:37.520 --> 35:39.124
We've been working
with him.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.733
Say that again.

35:40.830 --> 35:42.343
Several years ago,
the government entered into

35:42.440 --> 35:44.305
an immunity agreement
with Reddington.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.004
Now that
he's been arrested,

35:46.100 --> 35:48.091
I've been instructed
to keep that agreement secret,

35:48.180 --> 35:49.260
but I thought
you should know.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.225
Has the agreement
born fruit?

35:51.320 --> 35:53.402
A cornucopia.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.024
You want to keep it
in place.

36:05.110 --> 36:07.590
Yes, and I think
you'll want to, as well,

36:07.680 --> 36:09.591
after you understand
just how many cases...

36:09.680 --> 36:12.592
Will he be an effective C.I.
from prison?

36:12.690 --> 36:14.248
No.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.467
You want me to kick him.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.778
I want you to know
all the facts.

36:18.870 --> 36:20.599
I want you to...
I came here assuming that

36:20.700 --> 36:22.600
you were going to help
prosecute Reddington.

36:22.700 --> 36:26.693
Instead, you want me
to conspire
with you to let him go.

36:26.790 --> 36:29.873
Once you go public,
all this goes away.

36:29.970 --> 36:31.449
Mr. Cooper, I can protect
the Bureau's relationship

36:31.530 --> 36:32.918
with Mr. Reddington
for now,

36:33.010 --> 36:35.797
_ but the most wanted man
in America, maybe the world,

36:35.880 --> 36:39.236
has been arrested
in New York City,

36:39.320 --> 36:42.448
and I will prosecute him to
the fullest extent of the law,

36:42.540 --> 36:45.543
immunity agreement
or not.

36:45.630 --> 36:48.190
So the rumors are true.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.848
You arerunning
for governor.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.860
Good evening.

37:00.950 --> 37:03.680
Today, I can report to the
American people
and to the world

37:03.780 --> 37:05.862
that earlier this afternoon,

37:05.960 --> 37:08.781
Officer Michael Baldwin
of the New York City
Police Department

37:08.870 --> 37:10.656
_ arrested _ _
international fugitive

37:10.750 --> 37:12.957
and traitor
to the United States,

37:13.050 --> 37:15.837
Mr. Raymond Reddington.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.524
As of this moment,

37:17.620 --> 37:19.668
I cannot speak to the details
of his arrest,

37:19.750 --> 37:21.012
but I can tell you this,

37:21.100 --> 37:22.749
in the coming days and weeks,

37:22.840 --> 37:24.489
my office will be exploring
all options

37:24.590 --> 37:28.060
regarding charges
and sentencing
against Mr. Reddington.

37:28.150 --> 37:30.152
And to_ the_ victims
of his crimes,

37:30.240 --> 37:33.676
I want you to know that
this case is my top priority,

37:33.770 --> 37:36.068
and I will not rest
until Mr. Reddington

37:36.160 --> 37:39.027
is held to account _
for all the pain and suffering

37:39.120 --> 37:42.647
he has inflicted on too many
for too long.

37:42.730 --> 37:44.516
Can we have a minute?

37:46.350 --> 37:48.124
He's my father.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.008
They won't acknowledge
the agreement.

37:56.090 --> 37:58.046
I need you to focus.

37:58.140 --> 38:00.358
They're not
gonna release you.Focus on What happened.

38:00.450 --> 38:01.610
They're gonna put you
on trial.

38:01.710 --> 38:03.223
How it happened.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.015
How?

38:05.100 --> 38:06.408
This wasn't an accident.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.923
My luck
didn't just run out.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.976
Someone tipped them.

38:11.070 --> 38:14.153
Someone close.

38:14.240 --> 38:15.673
What makes you think that?

38:15.770 --> 38:18.113
The cops
were tipped off.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.077
Not specifically about me.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.639
That would've triggered
a larger presence,

38:21.730 --> 38:23.504
and I would've noticed.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.295
Something about
a middle-aged White male

38:29.390 --> 38:30.948
carrying a concealed weapon,

38:31.040 --> 38:33.827
something a couple of cops
could follow up on

38:33.920 --> 38:35.433
quietly, discreetly.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.482
Do you have any idea
who it was?

38:39.570 --> 38:43.267
That's What I need your help
to find out.

38:43.360 --> 38:46.318
Forget about the prosecutor
and all this.

38:46.410 --> 38:48.924
I've been a step ahead of them
for decades.

38:49.020 --> 38:51.659
I'm confident
this won't change that.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.193
How can you say that?

38:53.280 --> 38:56.499
I need to find the person
who betrayed me.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.934
So you can kill him?

39:02.030 --> 39:05.249
I see hard times coming

39:05.340 --> 39:07.160
I'd say that depends.

39:07.250 --> 39:09.468
I feel the flood
in my veins

39:11.820 --> 39:16.951
I hear a warning
in the thunder

39:17.050 --> 39:21.089
I got a sinking
in my chest

39:21.180 --> 39:26.095
These thoughts keep running, running, running, running

39:26.180 --> 39:30.310
These thoughts keep running,
running, running, running

39:37.670 --> 39:41.458
I see hard times coming

39:44.250 --> 39:46.810
Ohhhh

39:46.900 --> 39:49.368
Ohhhh

39:49.470 --> 39:51.722
Ohhhh

39:54.600 --> 39:57.251
Ohhhh

39:57.350 --> 39:59.159
Ohhhh

39:59.260 --> 40:03.219
Ohhhh

40:03.310 --> 40:06.529
I see blood in the river

40:08.880 --> 40:11.838
As the current pulls me down

40:14.100 --> 40:16.227
I slowly fade
into the darkness

40:16.320 --> 40:18.709
JENNIFER: I know you
were having
second thoughts.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.495
And I scream
without a sound

40:20.590 --> 40:22.410
It was
the right thing to do.

40:22.500 --> 40:25.719
These thoughts keep running, running, running, running

40:25.810 --> 40:28.802
What's the biggest obstacle
standing between us

40:28.900 --> 40:30.765
and finding out
who he really is?

40:30.860 --> 40:32.851
It was him.

40:32.950 --> 40:36.681
He deleted his file.
He dropped by unannounced.

40:36.780 --> 40:41.217
Ohhhh, ohhhh
I had to hide in the closet
to keep him from seeing me.

40:41.300 --> 40:44.042
Ohhhh
As long as he's free, we're
never gonna find the truth.

40:44.130 --> 40:45.859
Ohhhh

40:45.960 --> 40:49.043
Ohhhh

40:49.140 --> 40:51.608
Personally, I think
it's cause for celebration.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.871
Ohhhh

40:53.970 --> 40:56.097
Ohhhh

40:56.190 --> 41:00.092
Ohhhh

41:00.190 --> 41:02.454
He asked me to find out
who tipped off the police.

41:05.630 --> 41:08.542
It's all that matters
to him.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.710
Not that
he's been arrested or...

41:10.810 --> 41:12.243
With all these worries
taking over

41:12.330 --> 41:13.979
That he's gonna be
put on trial...

41:15.820 --> 41:17.117
It's getting harder and harder to breathe

41:17.210 --> 41:20.464
And face the death penalty.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.120
I see hard times coming

41:23.210 --> 41:25.861
All he cares about is
finding out who betrayed him.

41:25.960 --> 41:30.829
I see hard times coming

41:30.920 --> 41:32.308
I see hard times coming

41:32.400 --> 41:33.697
I can't imagine
What he'll do...

41:36.100 --> 41:37.522
I see hard times coming

41:37.620 --> 41:39.611
If he ever finds out
that it was me.

41:42.710 --> 41:45.144
Ohhhh

41:45.240 --> 41:48.061
Ohhhh

41:48.150 --> 41:50.368
Ohhhh
