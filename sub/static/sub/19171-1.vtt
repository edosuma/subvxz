Saroo!

03:09.648 --> 03:11.609
Saroo!

03:20.034 --> 03:21.327
Come on, come on!

03:23.162 --> 03:23.913
Get up!

03:24.163 --> 03:25.163
Come on. Quickly!

03:27.625 --> 03:28.625
Hold it properly.

03:33.923 --> 03:34.923
Saroo, catch!

03:40.721 --> 03:44.016
Hey! Hey!

03:45.267 --> 03:46.267
Get down!

03:48.354 --> 03:49.563
Guddu! The guards!

03:50.105 --> 03:51.232
Hey!

03:52.066 --> 03:53.317
Hey, boy, get down!

03:56.695 --> 03:57.947
Go! Get down, boy!

04:10.334 --> 04:13.712
- Saroo!
- Guddu!

04:28.978 --> 04:29.978
Saroo.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.272
I'm here.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.400
We will get a lot of money today.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.277
We've got a lot of coal!

04:36.527 --> 04:37.820
Show me!

04:38.362 --> 04:39.613
Ohhh, so much!

04:40.948 --> 04:43.534
You kept telling me how little I am...

04:43.784 --> 04:45.160
...but see how clever I am?

04:45.661 --> 04:47.871
That's right, you are!

04:48.122 --> 04:50.124
You jumped from so high! What a leap!

04:50.374 --> 04:51.917
Yes great heights!

04:59.258 --> 05:00.926
Give them some milk - two packets.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.686
Guddu, I want some jalebis!

05:14.315 --> 05:16.608
One day I will buy you some jalebis.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.652
We'll buy the whole shop.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.486
Ha, alright.

05:28.787 --> 05:29.827
Which way should I go now?

05:29.913 --> 05:30.913
Left, left!

05:31.457 --> 05:32.583
Which way now?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Right, right.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.342
Do you want to drink some milk?

05:48.932 --> 05:50.100
I got some milk!

05:51.143 --> 05:52.394
Hey.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.862
It's magic.

06:06.784 --> 06:07.785
Tell me now...

06:08.494 --> 06:10.287
...how did you get the milk?

06:11.455 --> 06:12.455
Be honest.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.586
Guddu? Saroo?

06:30.724 --> 06:31.724
No.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.567
Okay, Shekila, I have to work now.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.363
Who's going to look after Shekila?

06:46.198 --> 06:47.198
My Saroo?

06:51.370 --> 06:52.621
Come. Eat.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.625
Sleep... Sleep.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.261
How long will you be away for?

07:07.511 --> 07:08.929
You did a really good job today.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.105
I want to come too.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.650
How many days?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.402
I'm going for a week.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.404
Who's going to look after Shekila?

07:25.821 --> 07:26.947
Kallu will be here.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.241
You're too small to lift bales.

07:29.491 --> 07:30.868
I can lift anything.

07:37.416 --> 07:38.959
Guddu.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.293
Can I come too?

07:40.544 --> 07:42.588
You're too small, you can't do this.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.506
I can lift anything.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.136
Saroo.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.428
I've told you.

07:50.471 --> 07:53.474
It's night work. Not for kids.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.350
Go, go. You're too small.

07:57.478 --> 07:58.562
Saroo, leave it.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.398
I can lift this.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.072
Okay, fine.

08:18.874 --> 08:20.125
Hey, Guddu!

08:20.459 --> 08:22.669
Hey! How are you, Shankar?

09:07.881 --> 09:12.386
Saroo, come on, wake up now!

09:17.599 --> 09:18.599
Saroo, wake up.

09:18.684 --> 09:19.684
I want to sleep.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.104
I want to sleep.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.229
Saroo, wake up

09:23.397 --> 09:25.774
Don't annoy me. I am sleeping.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.066
It's my fault.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.527
I brought you here.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.779
You're too young for the night work.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.448
It's so late.
You will never be able to work.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.249
Saroo,

09:42.457 --> 09:44.257
Saroo, I'm going to find out
about work, okay?

09:44.376 --> 09:46.295
And then I'll come back.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.463
You wait here, don't go anywhere.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.758
Guddu.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.804
Just bring back a hundred jalebis.

09:56.388 --> 09:57.514
You want jalebis?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.349
Bring me two thousand jalebis!

10:00.183 --> 10:00.684
Jalebis?

10:01.018 --> 10:02.853
Just wait there. Don't go anywhere.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.472
Guddu?

10:49.900 --> 10:51.485
Guddu?

11:27.062 --> 11:28.647
Guddu?

11:32.401 --> 11:33.985
Guddu?

12:33.754 --> 12:34.921
Help me!

12:39.885 --> 12:40.885
Guddu!

12:42.304 --> 12:43.889
Guddu!

12:44.139 --> 12:45.139
Help me!

12:45.390 --> 12:46.600
Guddu!

12:46.725 --> 12:47.934
Someone save me!

12:49.811 --> 12:50.811
Guddu!

12:51.938 --> 12:53.940
Help me!

12:55.817 --> 12:56.985
Guddu!

13:39.361 --> 13:42.405
Mum, I love you very much.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.201
Guddu, I miss you very much.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.491
The train on platform two is
a decommissioned train.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.017
It is not taking passengers.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.394
Save me!

14:13.228 --> 14:14.271
Someone help me!

14:15.647 --> 14:17.232
Get me out of here!

14:22.195 --> 14:23.530
Save me...

14:26.950 --> 14:28.285
Get me out of here!

14:28.577 --> 14:29.578
Save me!

14:33.874 --> 14:35.000
Guddu!

14:35.500 --> 14:36.751
Save me!

15:55.956 --> 15:56.956
Open!

16:38.164 --> 16:40.041
Guddu!

16:43.044 --> 16:44.879
Mum!

16:47.590 --> 16:49.300
Guddu!

16:52.387 --> 16:54.097
Mum!

17:03.314 --> 17:04.314
Ganestalay?

17:04.398 --> 17:06.151
Ganestalay?

17:06.526 --> 17:08.611
I want to go home. Ganestalay.

17:12.323 --> 17:13.907
Ganestalay?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.248
Ganestalay?

17:20.415 --> 17:21.415
I don't understand!

17:21.665 --> 17:23.126
I want to go home.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.603
Speak Bengali! I don't understand you.

17:24.627 --> 17:25.627
Move!

17:29.966 --> 17:31.009
Ganestalay?

24:17.290 --> 24:19.876
Don't walk on that, you'll fall off.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.378
What's the matter,
you don't understand Bengali?

24:26.174 --> 24:27.467
Do you understand Hindi?

24:29.218 --> 24:30.344
Yes.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.472
Where are you going?

24:33.681 --> 24:36.267
I have to go home. I am lost.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.037
Did you come from this way or that way?

24:39.854 --> 24:41.189
I don't know which way.

24:41.439 --> 24:42.690
Then how will you go?

24:50.615 --> 24:51.824
What's your name?

24:52.450 --> 24:53.451
Saroo.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.621
My name is Noor.

24:59.874 --> 25:00.958
You're hungry?

25:07.089 --> 25:08.466
Come on...

25:12.053 --> 25:13.471
Come inside.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.143
Come on, come on!

25:32.240 --> 25:35.076
I have to do all this...

25:35.326 --> 25:36.766
...make lunch boxes for all the men.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.330
You have to feed your stomach, you know.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.125
Everybody has to work.

25:43.918 --> 25:46.921
I help my mum...

25:47.213 --> 25:50.633
...to carry rocks.

25:52.093 --> 25:53.094
Your mum carries rocks?

26:04.689 --> 26:05.856
What is this?

26:09.277 --> 26:10.361
Just drink.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.201
Leave some for me!

26:17.451 --> 26:18.911
Huh?

26:45.813 --> 26:48.065
And now a bit of soap...

26:55.823 --> 26:57.700
There is a man...

26:57.992 --> 26:59.869
...and he is called Rama.

27:01.037 --> 27:02.830
He's a very good man.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.915
He helps everyone.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.044
He will help you too.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.423
He's coming tomorrow morning.

27:16.093 --> 27:18.846
Is he going to help me look for my mum?

27:19.180 --> 27:20.306
Mm.

27:21.641 --> 27:27.063
He's going to help you look for your mum.

27:27.605 --> 27:29.065
Hmm?

27:29.440 --> 27:31.484
Close your eyes...

27:32.109 --> 27:33.944
...go to sleep.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.200
Sleep.

27:49.043 --> 27:50.628
Oh, my baby...

27:50.878 --> 27:52.046
...were you sleeping?

27:57.593 --> 28:01.347
I wonder what worlds you've travelled in.

28:01.681 --> 28:03.099
Are you Rama?

28:03.349 --> 28:05.351
Yes, but not the God.

28:17.154 --> 28:18.406
Ah...

28:25.162 --> 28:27.039
Come and lie down.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.334
Come closer.

28:33.087 --> 28:36.173
Do you know, I've come to meet you
from really far away...

28:39.760 --> 28:42.430
...and I want to take you
to a really nice place.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.683
Are you going to take me to Mum?

28:46.100 --> 28:49.478
And from there we're going
to try and look for your mum.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.523
I'll be back tonight...

28:54.442 --> 28:56.152
...and then we'll search.

28:56.444 --> 28:57.695
Huh?

29:10.624 --> 29:11.624
Get up!

29:14.712 --> 29:15.963
Come closer.

29:29.602 --> 29:30.728
Say "thank you".

29:30.936 --> 29:33.439
Thank you.

29:37.902 --> 29:40.112
You've done well.

29:40.654 --> 29:43.657
He's exactly what they're looking for.

34:53.467 --> 34:55.469

34:55.719 --> 34:57.096
...and started talking to him.

34:57.513 --> 34:59.313
I realized he doesn't
speak a word of Bengali.

34:59.389 --> 35:01.266
He only speaks Hindi.

35:01.892 --> 35:04.311
I asked him where he was from.

35:04.895 --> 35:07.981
He replied with only one word...
"Ganestalay".

35:08.232 --> 35:09.858
- Ganestalay?
- Ganestalay.

35:10.192 --> 35:11.902
I've never heard of it.

35:13.987 --> 35:15.489
Ganestalay.

35:18.742 --> 35:21.203
Okay, which district is Ganestalay in?

35:21.453 --> 35:23.580

37:12.272 --> 37:13.565
Amita.

37:16.944 --> 37:20.572

37:27.120 --> 37:28.205
I've seen it.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.708
What are you going to do once you leave?

37:32.459 --> 37:34.378
I'm going to buy a watch.

37:50.519 --> 37:51.895
Did you write it?

37:52.646 --> 37:54.356
Hey, Shondeep! What are you doing?

Hey. Hey.

40:19.292 --> 40:20.419
Yes, Saroo.

40:21.211 --> 40:23.130
My name is Mrs. Sood. Come sit here.

40:25.465 --> 40:27.759
It's my job to make sure that

40:28.260 --> 40:30.887
...there isn't a single kid here

40:31.221 --> 40:33.849
...who should be somewhere else.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.893
That's why I'm here.

40:37.352 --> 40:40.439
People don't like me here.

40:43.984 --> 40:45.360
Look at this.

40:47.362 --> 40:50.282
We have been asking around
about you for a long time.

40:50.574 --> 40:54.035
We have published it in the newspaper.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.663
In all the newspapers in Calcutta.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.666
15 million people read this paper.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.960
That's a lot of people.

41:03.295 --> 41:04.921
But we haven't...

41:05.797 --> 41:07.632
...had a single reply.

41:08.091 --> 41:09.676
My home is really far.

41:11.344 --> 41:14.306
Not one reply.

41:15.015 --> 41:16.850
What about Mum?

41:17.309 --> 41:18.309
No...

41:19.227 --> 41:20.687
...not even Mum.

41:25.859 --> 41:27.152
Guddu?

41:28.904 --> 41:29.904
Saroo.

41:30.530 --> 41:33.909
We have found a family over in Australia...

41:34.409 --> 41:37.120
...who want to look after you.

41:38.371 --> 41:40.790
Do you know where Australia is?

41:41.500 --> 41:42.876
Would you like to see them?

41:44.044 --> 41:44.711
Come.

41:44.878 --> 41:46.046
I'll show you.

41:48.256 --> 41:49.799
Come sit here.

41:53.094 --> 41:54.221
Look.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.515
Look at this. This is John...

41:57.057 --> 41:59.059
...and this is Sue.

42:01.353 --> 42:02.646
This...

42:03.313 --> 42:06.399
...this is their home.

42:07.234 --> 42:08.985
They live in Tasmania...

42:09.361 --> 42:10.695
...a small island...

42:10.820 --> 42:12.300
...and everyone there is really nice.

42:14.241 --> 42:16.368
They are such nice people!

42:16.701 --> 42:17.953
Aren't they?

42:20.163 --> 42:23.208
Keep this with you, and keep it safe.

42:23.500 --> 42:24.500
OK?

42:27.212 --> 42:28.421
Saroo.

42:29.589 --> 42:32.092
Son, you can't stay here.

42:33.927 --> 42:35.303
Hmm?

42:46.398 --> 42:49.192
Did you really look for my mum?

42:52.654 --> 42:55.031
Looked everywhere.

43:30.984 --> 43:33.111
You'll have a nice home.

43:33.445 --> 43:35.822
Australia is a great place.

43:51.838 --> 43:53.298
Does everybody have a napkin?

43:53.590 --> 43:54.924
This is called a "serviette".

43:55.050 --> 43:55.467
Serviette.

43:55.592 --> 43:59.387
Lay it down on your lap like this
so that food doesn't fall on your clothes.

43:59.679 --> 44:01.181
So it doesn't ruin them.

44:01.473 --> 44:04.893
I'm going to teach you
how to eat using cutlery.

44:05.226 --> 44:09.356
I will ask you, and you will tell me
in English... what each thing is called.

44:09.814 --> 44:10.940
What do you call this?

44:11.066 --> 44:12.317
Fork.

44:12.442 --> 44:14.694
Fork. Yes, good.

44:15.153 --> 44:16.404
What do you call this?

44:16.696 --> 44:17.947
- Nice.
- Knife.

44:18.073 --> 44:18.782
Knife.

44:18.907 --> 44:20.367
Not "nice"..."knife".

44:20.575 --> 44:21.451
Okay?

44:21.576 --> 44:22.576
- Good.
- Knife.

44:22.744 --> 44:23.203
And this?

44:23.536 --> 44:25.288
- Spoon.
- Spoon.

44:25.413 --> 44:27.791
- Spoon. Good.
- Spoon.

44:28.416 --> 44:31.127
Okay, Manisha, you tell me... What is this?

44:32.128 --> 44:33.213
Try to remember...

44:34.464 --> 44:35.840
- Salt.
- Salt.

44:35.965 --> 44:37.842
Very good.

44:39.260 --> 44:41.137
Peppa!

44:41.262 --> 44:43.640
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

44:46.351 --> 44:48.103
Pepper.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.086
In here.

45:59.841 --> 46:00.967
Saroo.

46:01.551 --> 46:03.470
This is your mum and dad.

46:04.220 --> 46:05.680
Say hello.

46:12.061 --> 46:14.105
Hello. I'm Swarmina.

46:14.230 --> 46:16.733
Hello. I'm John. This is Sue.

46:19.277 --> 46:20.320
Hello, there.

46:22.614 --> 46:25.992
Hello. Here, that's for you.

46:28.620 --> 46:31.247
Good on the plane?

46:31.372 --> 46:33.541
- Yeah, good?
- He doesn't...

46:33.666 --> 46:35.794
Sue.

46:35.919 --> 46:37.504
Mummy and...

46:37.629 --> 46:39.631
Dad.

46:39.756 --> 46:42.091
And we're so happy to meet you.

46:42.217 --> 46:43.802
Yeah.

46:53.853 --> 46:55.063
A boat.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.868
Amazing.

47:08.993 --> 47:10.954
Gently, gently.

47:19.337 --> 47:21.089
This is where you live.

47:22.715 --> 47:25.510
Down there,
that's the living room.

47:30.890 --> 47:32.392
Television.

47:35.103 --> 47:37.355
Do you know
what a television is?

47:38.815 --> 47:41.150
Pictures.

47:41.276 --> 47:43.236
That's the water.

47:44.445 --> 47:45.780
That's the water.

47:45.905 --> 47:47.282
You see?

47:54.080 --> 47:55.957
You can open it.

48:17.854 --> 48:20.565
Do you want me
to cut it up for him?

48:20.690 --> 48:21.983
Good.

48:30.617 --> 48:32.869
Pepper.

48:32.994 --> 48:35.663
- What was that?
- Pepper.

48:35.788 --> 48:37.206
Oh!

48:37.332 --> 48:38.458
Yes, pepper.

48:38.583 --> 48:40.877
- That's right. And...
- Pepper.

48:42.003 --> 48:43.546
- Sauce.
- Sauce!

48:44.964 --> 48:46.925
- S... Salt.
- Salt.

48:47.050 --> 48:48.843
Very good.

49:04.734 --> 49:06.235
Hi.

49:10.531 --> 49:13.660
So you've come a long way,
haven't you, hmm?

49:16.663 --> 49:18.289
Little one.

49:20.124 --> 49:23.211
I'm sure it hasn't been easy,

49:23.336 --> 49:26.631
and one day you'll tell me
all about it.

49:26.756 --> 49:29.425
You'll tell me everything.
Who you are, everything.

49:31.427 --> 49:33.846
I'll always listen.

49:36.057 --> 49:38.017
Always.

49:54.200 --> 49:55.994
See? Yeah, yeah.

49:58.454 --> 50:00.665
Yeah.

50:03.710 --> 50:05.086
Go easy on me, yeah?

50:05.211 --> 50:06.337
Okay.

50:06.462 --> 50:08.506
- Okay!
- Right.

50:08.631 --> 50:11.050
- Mum, ready?
- Feel the tension.

50:13.678 --> 50:16.180
Here he comes.
Come on, mate, send it down.

50:18.516 --> 50:20.977
- Yeah!
- Go, go, Saroo!

50:21.102 --> 50:22.729
Come on, run in!

50:24.063 --> 50:26.858
Yes, she's out!
Australia wins!

50:26.983 --> 50:30.903
Well done.
How could you do that to me!

50:32.947 --> 50:34.115
All right...

50:34.240 --> 50:37.160
Dad. Mum. Saroo.

50:37.285 --> 50:38.411
Mm-hmm.

50:38.536 --> 50:39.954
- Mantosh.
- Yes.

50:40.079 --> 50:43.249
Yeah...

50:43.374 --> 50:45.043
Hello again.

50:46.335 --> 50:48.337
Oh, Saroo, my goodness.
Look at you!

50:48.463 --> 50:49.797
- Hey.
- Hi.

50:49.922 --> 50:52.675
Oh, my gosh,
we've been so excited.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.677
- This is Mantosh.
- Hi!

50:54.802 --> 50:56.804
Hi, Mantosh.

50:56.929 --> 50:59.682
This is Saroo. I'm Sue.

51:01.017 --> 51:02.351
Hello.

51:02.477 --> 51:04.187
This is Saroo, your brother.

51:04.312 --> 51:06.230
- And John.
- Hello, mate.

51:08.024 --> 51:11.235
Show...
Show Mantosh what you made.

51:11.360 --> 51:12.945
- Oh...
- Oh...

51:13.071 --> 51:15.573
- Saroo did a picture.
- Yeah.

51:22.789 --> 51:26.000
- It's been a long flight.
- Yes, yes, yes.

51:26.125 --> 51:27.752
You must be hungry.

51:27.877 --> 51:29.897
- We're going to go get something to eat.
- Yeah.

51:29.921 --> 51:31.106
- Would you, um...
- Yeah.

51:31.130 --> 51:32.423
Would you like to join us?

51:32.548 --> 51:35.051
Oh, okay. That would be nice.

51:39.222 --> 51:42.809
Hey.

51:42.934 --> 51:44.685
- John, stop him, stop him.
- Hey, hey.

51:44.811 --> 51:46.413
He's hurting his leg.
He's hurting his leg.

51:46.437 --> 51:48.123
No, no, no. No, no, no, gentle.
You're all right.

51:48.147 --> 51:49.625
- No, no, it's okay. It's all right.
- Come on.

51:49.649 --> 51:51.234
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
John, John.

51:51.359 --> 51:52.836
- I know, I know, I know.
- Come on, come on, let's go.

51:52.860 --> 51:55.571
- No, no, no.
- Hey, mate.

51:55.696 --> 51:57.549
- It's all right. Play.
- It's okay, mate.

51:57.573 --> 51:59.450
You just play with your toys.

51:59.575 --> 52:00.803
No, no, no,
don't hit, mate.

52:00.827 --> 52:02.578
Don't-don't hit. Don't hit.

52:02.703 --> 52:04.622
Don't hit yourself.
Don't hit yourself.

52:04.747 --> 52:06.541
No, no, not your head.
Not your head!

52:06.666 --> 52:07.976
- Come on.
- You're right. You're right.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
You're right.

52:10.962 --> 52:12.296
It's okay, it's okay.

52:12.421 --> 52:13.756
Come on.

52:13.881 --> 52:16.259
I know. It's okay, mate.
It's okay.

52:16.384 --> 52:18.344
Hey, look, it's the boats.

52:20.138 --> 52:21.597
It's better now.

52:23.391 --> 52:25.977
Sweetheart. Shh.

52:54.463 --> 52:55.923
I'm okay.

53:13.733 --> 53:15.026
Hey.

53:28.080 --> 53:30.082
I'm all right.

54:10.539 --> 54:13.209
Yes, well, you pay extra for
all the bubbles in this one.

54:13.334 --> 54:14.835
We're going to miss you.

54:14.961 --> 54:16.295
- Okay...
- Yeah.

54:16.420 --> 54:17.755
It's only Melbourne.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.882
- I know.
- No, it's across the water.

54:22.551 --> 54:24.428
Saroo.

54:24.553 --> 54:25.721
Our beautiful boy.

54:27.306 --> 54:29.183
May this bring you
all that you could wish for.

54:29.308 --> 54:30.184
Yeah.

54:30.309 --> 54:31.769
And then some.

54:31.894 --> 54:33.187
Thanks, Mum. Thanks, Dad.

54:33.312 --> 54:35.231
From the moment
you came into our lives...

54:35.356 --> 54:37.149
- Mum.
- No, no, no, let me finish.

54:37.275 --> 54:40.486
From the moment
you came into our lives,

54:40.611 --> 54:42.738
you were all that we could
have hoped for.

54:42.863 --> 54:44.740
Yeah.

54:44.865 --> 54:48.536
More. More than
we hoped for, really.

54:48.661 --> 54:51.038
And, uh... more work,
that's for sure.

54:52.873 --> 54:55.084
You've really embraced
every opportunity.

54:55.209 --> 54:57.503
Yeah, we're very proud
of you, son.

54:57.628 --> 55:00.673
Very proud and very excited
for this next

55:00.798 --> 55:02.341
- chapter in your life.
- Yeah.

55:04.552 --> 55:06.178
- Cheers.
- To success.

55:06.304 --> 55:08.031
Excuse me, guys, are you
still waiting on someone?

55:08.055 --> 55:10.495
- Or can I take this plate away?
- Yeah, you can take it away.

55:10.599 --> 55:13.394
- No, no, no, you can leave it.
- No, take it.

55:13.519 --> 55:16.314
I'd like to keep it.
Thank you.

55:22.611 --> 55:25.072
You don't really think
he'll turn up, do you?

55:25.197 --> 55:26.699
No, just leave it, son.

55:30.703 --> 55:33.122
Mm. That's a nice one.

55:33.247 --> 55:36.375
Yeah, it's a good one,
this one. It's a local one.

55:52.391 --> 55:54.393
Mantosh.

56:13.871 --> 56:16.374
Yeah, sorry
I didn't make lunch.

56:19.168 --> 56:21.170
What's that course again?

56:21.295 --> 56:23.214
Hotel management.

56:24.757 --> 56:27.718
So you're going to go
and learn to what?

56:27.843 --> 56:30.596
Manage a hotel?

56:31.680 --> 56:33.808
Well, have fun.

56:33.933 --> 56:35.434
Any bills you need to pay?

56:35.559 --> 56:37.603
You can give us a job
when you come back.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.730
Please, could you not do
anything while I'm away...

56:39.855 --> 56:41.415
- Yeah, yeah.
- ...that's gonna make Mum

56:41.482 --> 56:44.110
more unhappy
than you already do.

56:44.235 --> 56:45.903
Mate...

56:47.405 --> 56:49.532
Why do you think I stay away?

57:08.134 --> 57:10.177
<i>We see ourselves
as the United Nations</i>

57:10.302 --> 57:11.762
<i>of hospitality schools,</i>

57:11.887 --> 57:14.390
<i>and we like to think
we teach a global</i>

57:14.515 --> 57:16.767
and balanced perspective.

57:16.892 --> 57:19.186
You're here because
you have a dream.

57:19.311 --> 57:22.690
We're here to help make
that dream a reality.

57:40.958 --> 57:42.918
<i>Yeah, and I saw first-hand</i>

57:43.043 --> 57:46.255
how the hospitality industry
can really bring infrastructure

57:46.380 --> 57:48.048
to communities that need it.

57:48.174 --> 57:51.135
But I also saw a lot of
the problems that they cause.

57:51.260 --> 57:53.012
Which is why community groups

57:53.137 --> 57:55.890
need to be involved
every step of the way

57:56.015 --> 57:57.808
and they need to be
taken seriously.

57:57.933 --> 58:01.479
And I guess I want to help
facilitate that

58:01.604 --> 58:03.397
and help give them a voice.

58:03.522 --> 58:04.857
Saroo.

58:04.982 --> 58:06.942
I want to run hotels

58:07.067 --> 58:08.777
that put all the profits
into my pocket.

58:08.903 --> 58:10.446
Well, let's, uh...

58:10.571 --> 58:11.965
start with where you're from,
shall we?

58:11.989 --> 58:13.699
So, born in Australia?

58:13.824 --> 58:16.660
Yeah. No, uh, Calcutta.

58:16.785 --> 58:19.747
I've got family in Kolkata.
My cousins there are quite mad.

58:19.872 --> 58:20.748
Which part?

58:20.873 --> 58:22.082
I'm adopted.

58:22.208 --> 58:25.044
I'm not really Indian.

58:27.421 --> 58:28.821
But you like cricket,
though, right?

58:30.049 --> 58:32.968
Ah, you like cricket.

58:33.093 --> 58:35.095
You go for the Aussies
or the Indians?

58:35.221 --> 58:39.099
- Only the Aussies, mate.
- Oh, only the Aussies, mate!

58:39.225 --> 58:40.702
Yeah, this is going to be
interesting.

58:40.726 --> 58:43.395
Okay, Saroo, um...

58:43.521 --> 58:44.939
why did you choose this course,

58:45.064 --> 58:47.691
and what else
do you want to get out of it?

58:58.702 --> 59:00.120
Hi.

59:34.446 --> 59:36.198
- Hi. How are you?
- Welcome.

59:36.323 --> 59:38.200
- Thanks for coming. Come in.
- Thank you.

59:38.325 --> 59:40.262
- It's so good to see you.
- Mm, smells so good in here.

59:40.286 --> 59:41.370
Hi.

59:41.495 --> 59:43.539
Hi. How are you?

59:43.664 --> 59:47.084
I hope you guys
like Indian food.

59:47.209 --> 59:49.837
'Cause that's all we have.
That's all we have!

59:49.962 --> 59:51.755
Oh, it smells so good.

59:51.880 --> 59:55.175
I tried to copy some
of my mom's recipes.

59:55.301 --> 59:57.386
Have you ever done
any Bollywood dancing?

59:57.511 --> 59:59.722
- Oh, just, like, one leg?
- Yeah, yeah, one leg.

59:59.847 --> 01:00:01.056
That's good!

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:03.350
You're on your way!

01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:06.270
Okay, well, like, I say
flashlight. What do you say?

01:00:06.395 --> 01:00:08.856
<i>- Lampe de poche.
- "Lampe de poche."</i>

01:00:10.566 --> 01:00:12.526
Flashlight is, um... <i>budhi.</i>

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:13.694
- Oh.
- So fancy.

01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:15.446
- What do you say?
- Torch.

01:00:15.571 --> 01:00:17.340
If you want to eat
with your hand, you need to...

01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:20.326
- use the naan like a spoon.
- Use the fork, Saroo.

01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:22.536
- No, let him use the naan.
- No.

01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:24.371
Okay, well,
how do you say taxi?

01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:25.748
- Taxi.
- Taxi.

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:27.666
It's the same
in every language.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.060
- You want a fork, Saroo?
- Let him try.

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:30.544
No, no, no, it's hard for him.

01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:33.589
Just like my father.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:37.718
- Want another beer?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

01:00:37.843 --> 01:00:40.679
I still think you're crazy
for living anywhere in Africa.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:01.992
<i>Guddu...</i>

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:25.683
Saroo...

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:32.773
Are you okay?

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:42.866
Saroo?

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:50.499
I'm not from Calcutta.

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.796
I'm lost.

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:57.464
Howrah Station is enormous.

01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:59.383
You must have been
freaking out.

01:01:59.508 --> 01:02:01.844
I once went through there
on a pilgrimage to Puri,

01:02:01.969 --> 01:02:03.887
and I missed
my connection twice.

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:06.265
And you didn't speak Bengali?

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.434
I didn't even know
it was called that.

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:10.477
How long were you
on the train?

01:02:10.602 --> 01:02:13.647
- A couple of days.
- Couple of days?

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:16.233
Saroo, what was
your hometown again?

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:17.860
Ganestalay.

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:21.947
I must have had it wrong,
'cause it doesn't exist.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.742
But there must be something
else that you do remember.

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:26.994
Oh...

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:30.664
The platform...

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:33.417
I fell asleep on
had this big rain tank.

01:02:33.542 --> 01:02:37.004
- And it was only a few stops from Ganestalay.
- Huh.

01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:39.423
Well, there are thousands
of stations with rain tanks.

01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:41.467
Look, it was a...
a long time ago.

01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:43.677
Have you heard of this
new program, Google Earth?

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.220
- Ah.
- It's incredible.

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:46.740
You can find any place
from anywhere.

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:49.183
Listen to me.
We can find out how fast

01:02:49.308 --> 01:02:51.268
passenger trains went
back then.

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.437
We take that speed,
multiply it by the hours

01:02:53.562 --> 01:02:55.189
that you were on the train.

01:02:55.314 --> 01:02:57.900
That's it.
We create a search radius.

01:02:58.025 --> 01:03:00.569
And inside there, you'll find
the station with the rain tank.

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.414
Yeah, but it would take
a lifetime to search

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.031
all the stations in India.

01:03:04.156 --> 01:03:06.074
You... did I say
all the stations?

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.701
Okay, even half the stations...

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:09.828
Really, guys, I don't want
to talk about this.

01:03:11.205 --> 01:03:13.332
Did your parents try
to find you?

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:15.292
- What?
- Of course they tried to find him.

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:16.543
No, I just mean, like,

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:18.170
you know, if they tried
to find him,

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.898
maybe they left, like,
a paper trail or something.

01:03:19.922 --> 01:03:22.299
What paper trail?
He didn't know his surname.

01:03:22.424 --> 01:03:23.884
My mum couldn't read or write.

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:26.053
What did she do?

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:27.178
A laborer.

01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:28.472
She carried rocks.

01:03:28.597 --> 01:03:29.473
Your mum?

01:03:29.598 --> 01:03:31.391
Hey. Just...

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:38.482
My mom died about, uh,
four years ago now.

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:41.235
I'm sorry.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.112
My dad is just
still so angry at her.

01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:45.823
I mean, not for getting sick,
obviously,

01:03:45.948 --> 01:03:48.367
but just for refusing chemo.

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:52.663
But she just knew herself,
you know?

01:03:52.788 --> 01:03:54.039
She knew what her terms were,

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:56.750
and she knew how
she wanted to live, so...

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:01.046
He just couldn't accept that,
I guess.

01:04:04.383 --> 01:04:06.426
And how do you feel?

01:04:06.552 --> 01:04:08.595
Mm, I just miss her.

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:15.185
What do you think of Bharat's
search radius idea?

01:04:24.236 --> 01:04:25.904
What is that?

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:28.907
Is that your dancing?

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:31.034
Is that how you dance?

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:32.911
Oh, God!

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.015
Hi.

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:38.764
You can't keep
going on like this.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.393
Let me help you.

01:07:47.022 --> 01:07:49.983
Come on, let's go for a run.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:54.404
What?

01:08:00.202 --> 01:08:01.745
Lucy!

01:08:08.627 --> 01:08:10.212
Come on.

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:13.715
Hold on. I've got a cramp.

01:08:16.218 --> 01:08:18.345
You're a... a cheat!

01:08:19.638 --> 01:08:21.932
Whoo! Whoo!

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:25.912
I never show anybody these.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.581
Why? They're beautiful.

01:09:27.706 --> 01:09:29.916
I do enjoy it.

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:32.711
My little hobby.

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:35.380
- Oh, wow, look at Mantosh.
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:38.216
I'm so glad
he's coming tonight.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.886
Cheeky little thing.

01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:43.555
Pure energy...

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.890
but incredible.

01:09:45.974 --> 01:09:48.268
So sweet.

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:50.645
He's been hard to control,
but...

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:54.566
very, very smart and very...

01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:56.401
I mean, he could do anything

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:58.528
if he just learned
to control that energy.

01:09:58.653 --> 01:10:00.447
He could do it, do it all.

01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:03.116
Saroo's very protective of him.

01:10:08.163 --> 01:10:09.539
I've been blessed.

01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:16.213
Very blessed.

01:10:16.338 --> 01:10:19.925
Your mom showed me, um,
all your old little trophies.

01:10:21.051 --> 01:10:22.552
Mum, you didn't.

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:24.054
Mmm.

01:10:24.179 --> 01:10:25.889
I had no idea
you were so athletic.

01:10:26.014 --> 01:10:27.265
Oh, that's only half of them.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:28.710
There's plenty more
in the garage.

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:30.685
- Dad.
- Hey, where you going, mate?

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.063
Just finishing my smoke.

01:10:33.188 --> 01:10:35.065
I can barely get him
off the couch these days.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:36.650
Lucy.

01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:43.966
Why can't you just tell them
what you've been up to?

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.158
Don't.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.245
Tell us.

01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:50.664
They would understand.
They would support you.

01:10:50.789 --> 01:10:53.083
What? Come on.

01:10:53.208 --> 01:10:55.835
Hey, um, dinner. Mmm.

01:10:55.961 --> 01:10:57.837
Well, eat it while it's hot.

01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:02.676
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

01:11:04.386 --> 01:11:05.428
What?

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:10.225
- What have I missed?
- Nothing.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:12.894
- She looks upset.
- She's not upset.

01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:14.521
You don't know how I feel.

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:18.275
Saroo knows everything.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.026
He's an expert.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:21.903
Oh.

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:24.155
He's a manager.

01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:25.699
Why are you here?

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:29.953
He's here
because he's your brother.

01:11:30.078 --> 01:11:32.914
- No, he's not.
- Oh...

01:11:38.503 --> 01:11:40.755
- We're different.
- Hey. Now, now, Saroo!

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.132
Saroo.

01:11:49.556 --> 01:11:51.099
All right.

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:53.810
Hey. Hey, come on.

01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:56.771
It's all right.

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.418
- Hey, hey. Now, now, it's okay.
- All right.

01:12:00.442 --> 01:12:01.651
Hey, it's okay.

01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:03.570
It's okay...

01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:05.881
- It's all right, it's all right.
- Just breathe.

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:08.074
- Stop!
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:12:08.199 --> 01:12:09.451
Don't move.

01:12:09.576 --> 01:12:11.119
It's... it's okay.

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:14.039
Nice one, mate.

01:12:15.707 --> 01:12:17.587
Hey, hey, it's okay, mate.

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:19.044
It's okay.

01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:21.421
Just breathe, mate.
Just breathe. It's okay.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:31.723
I hate what he's done to you.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:06.591
I'm sorry.

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:26.403
Saroo!

01:13:27.487 --> 01:13:29.114
Saroo!

01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:32.826
Saroo!

01:13:55.014 --> 01:13:56.933
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:58.226
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:36.681
Hey.

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:43.062
Be with me.

01:14:46.733 --> 01:14:48.485
Stop. Luce.

01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:50.778
Hey, look at me.

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:55.366
Look at me.

01:14:55.492 --> 01:14:56.868
- Can this wait?
- Where are you?

01:14:56.993 --> 01:15:00.413
Let's go. Can this wait
till we get home, yeah?

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:02.165
Home?

01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:05.043
- Hey.
- What home?

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:06.836
You mean where I'm alone
in one room

01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:09.255
and you're alone
in the other room? Come on.

01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:11.966
Stop it, Luce. Stop it.

01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:14.761
Come on.

01:15:14.886 --> 01:15:16.054
Stop it, Lucy.

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:22.268
Saroo!
You need to face reality!

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:27.190
What do you mean, reality?

01:15:27.315 --> 01:15:30.443
Do you have any idea
what it's like

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:32.695
knowing my real brother
and mother

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:35.990
spend every day of their lives
looking for me?

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:37.700
- What?
- Huh?

01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:40.453
How every day my real brother
screams my name?

01:15:42.664 --> 01:15:44.499
Can you imagine
the pain they must be in

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:46.501
not knowing where I am?
Huh?

01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:49.003
25 years, Luce.

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:50.128
25!

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:54.259
Why didn't you tell me
that was happening for you?

01:15:54.384 --> 01:15:58.096
We swum about
in our privileged lives.

01:16:01.015 --> 01:16:02.559
It makes me sick.

01:16:02.684 --> 01:16:06.980
I have to find home.
They need to know I'm okay.

01:16:07.105 --> 01:16:10.817
I have never stopped you.
I want to help.

01:16:10.942 --> 01:16:12.318
I can't do this anymore.

01:16:12.443 --> 01:16:14.737
You deserve more.

01:16:14.862 --> 01:16:16.281
Don't you do that.

01:16:18.366 --> 01:16:21.911
Don't you dare do that.
This is on you, not on me.

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:30.873
<i>Saroo!</i>

01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:35.211
<i>Saroo!</i>

01:18:52.186 --> 01:18:53.855
Saroo?

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:00.862
Saroo!

01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:27.680
Saroo? You there, mate?

01:19:29.182 --> 01:19:31.184
There's a One Day
International tomorrow.

01:19:31.309 --> 01:19:33.227
You can come over if you like.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:38.483
Oh, I meant to tell you
I fixed the tiller.

01:19:38.608 --> 01:19:42.111
Why don't we take her out?
We can head up the coast.

01:19:45.198 --> 01:19:46.407
Hey, Saroo?

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:50.411
Mate, your mum's not, um...

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:53.164
Look, we've lost track of
Mantosh. He's missing again.

01:19:54.248 --> 01:19:56.542
You know how worried she gets.

01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:06.594
We know you quit your job,
mate.

01:20:07.887 --> 01:20:10.014
Just worried about you, son.

01:20:50.805 --> 01:20:53.182
I've been visiting her.

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:58.104
Every night,
I walk those streets home.

01:21:00.231 --> 01:21:02.316
Home from the dam.

01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:05.486
Home from the station.

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:10.074
And I know every single step
of the way.

01:21:12.493 --> 01:21:14.954
And I imagine that I'm...

01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:18.374
...whispering in her ear,

01:21:18.499 --> 01:21:20.334
<i>"Ammi,</i> it's all right."

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.798
What was she like?

01:21:26.883 --> 01:21:28.342
Beautiful.

01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:34.724
How was New York?

01:21:34.849 --> 01:21:37.435
It was the same.

01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:41.355
So what brings you back?

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.773
Our funding came through.

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:45.109
That's great.

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:46.110
See?

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:48.279
They know how good you are.

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:02.835
I miss you.

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:08.049
I saw your mom.

01:22:08.174 --> 01:22:09.550
She's not doing very well.

01:22:11.677 --> 01:22:14.847
I'm worried it'll kill her
if she knew I was searching.

01:22:14.972 --> 01:22:17.266
You underestimate her.

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:19.185
She needs you.

01:22:30.488 --> 01:22:31.488
No, Give me five rupees.

01:22:31.656 --> 01:22:32.776
...then I'll carry them all.

01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:36.953
Okay, you win, take this.

01:22:45.503 --> 01:22:47.880
He was carrying a watermelon
and didn't see it coming.

01:23:09.527 --> 01:23:10.695
What?

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:15.700
What if you do find home
and they're not even there?

01:23:18.953 --> 01:23:22.999
And you never stop
and you just keep searching?

01:23:23.124 --> 01:23:26.043
You don't know what
happens over time. Things...

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:30.589
...change.
Entire worlds change.

01:23:30.715 --> 01:23:32.842
I don't have a choice.

01:23:47.398 --> 01:23:49.358
Stay.

01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:55.406
I can't.

01:24:16.761 --> 01:24:17.928
Stay right there.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:22.099
Weren't you supposed to look after him?

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.060
Where were you?

01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:26.270
Don't you love him?

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:53.339
John heard Mantosh
is out on the boats.

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:00.971
Doing a lobster run.

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.730
He's due back tomorrow.

01:25:13.651 --> 01:25:16.529
So he'll be flush for cash.
Back on the hard stuff.

01:25:21.951 --> 01:25:24.829
I'm sorry you couldn't have
your own kids.

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:30.251
- What are you saying?
- I mean...

01:25:30.376 --> 01:25:33.796
we...

01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:36.632
weren't blank pages, were we?

01:25:36.757 --> 01:25:40.427
Like your own would have been.

01:25:40.553 --> 01:25:44.014
You weren't just adopting us
but our pasts as well, and...

01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:48.102
And I feel like
we're killing you.

01:25:48.227 --> 01:25:50.229
I could have had kids.

01:25:53.023 --> 01:25:55.776
- What?
- We chose not to have kids.

01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:00.030
We wanted the two of you.

01:26:01.073 --> 01:26:03.617
That's what we wanted.

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:06.787
We wanted the two of you
in our lives.

01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:08.914
That's what we chose.

01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:19.800
That's one of the reasons
I fell in love with your dad.

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:22.887
Because we both felt
that the...

01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:26.557
...the world has
enough people in it.

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:31.288
Have a child,
that wouldn't have guaranteed

01:26:31.312 --> 01:26:33.063
we were going to make
anything better,

01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:36.692
but to take a child that's
suffering like you boys were...

01:26:38.986 --> 01:26:41.030
...give you a chance
in the world...

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.992
...that's something.

01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:47.369
I bet you never imagined it
being this hard.

01:26:47.494 --> 01:26:49.997
It's not a matter of hard.

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:52.583
It's not a matt...

01:26:55.502 --> 01:27:00.049
There's only one path for me,
and that's how I think.

01:27:02.009 --> 01:27:04.345
That's how this happened,
because...

01:27:07.014 --> 01:27:11.310
...when I was 12,
I had a vision.

01:27:18.359 --> 01:27:20.444
Some people would say
that it was a...

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:22.154
it was a breakdown, but it...

01:27:25.199 --> 01:27:28.285
My dad was alcoholic, you know
that, and he was like...

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.496
he was...
he wasn't a good man.

01:27:30.621 --> 01:27:34.458
He was... he was
out of control, and I was...

01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:38.879
I was standing out the back
of our house,

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:41.257
I was looking out
across this field...

01:27:43.259 --> 01:27:47.012
...and I just wanted the earth
to swallow me up, and...

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.474
...and I...

01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:57.398
I felt an electric current.

01:27:57.523 --> 01:27:59.775
It was like a shock,
like a... a jolt,

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:02.111
through my whole body.

01:28:02.236 --> 01:28:07.366
And then I saw a brown-skinned
child across that field.

01:28:13.205 --> 01:28:15.207
And then he was standing
beside me,

01:28:15.332 --> 01:28:19.837
and it was right there, and I
could feel it so strongly.

01:28:22.673 --> 01:28:26.927
And for the first time in
my life, I felt something good.

01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:29.513
I felt... good.

01:28:31.724 --> 01:28:34.351
And I knew it was guiding me,

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:37.730
and I knew that I was
going to be fine.

01:28:40.441 --> 01:28:42.609
It was as if at that moment
I could see it.

01:28:42.735 --> 01:28:45.112
I could see my future
right there.

01:28:46.113 --> 01:28:47.948
Because I always thought

01:28:48.073 --> 01:28:51.035
that I could keep
this family together.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.536
And now...

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:56.957
Now I don't know where...

01:28:57.082 --> 01:28:58.459
- Mum.
- What's happening?

01:28:58.584 --> 01:29:00.377
I don't understand.

01:29:05.174 --> 01:29:07.301
You don't talk to me anymore.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.271
I need you, Saroo.

01:29:57.893 --> 01:29:59.812
Mantosh!

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:11.949
I'm sorry for what I said
at dinner.

01:31:38.243 --> 01:31:39.243
Guddu.

01:35:51.788 --> 01:35:55.125
Ganesh Talai.

01:35:56.418 --> 01:35:58.712
Ganesh Talai.

01:36:01.131 --> 01:36:02.966
Ganestalay.

01:36:56.978 --> 01:36:58.313
Mum.

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.802
I found home.

01:37:30.971 --> 01:37:32.514
What?

01:37:43.441 --> 01:37:45.527
Please wait for me.

01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:51.324
I'll be here.

01:37:58.498 --> 01:38:00.584
So this is where you've been.

01:38:02.627 --> 01:38:05.338
I didn't want you to feel
I was ungrateful.

01:38:07.591 --> 01:38:10.302
There wasn't a day
I didn't want to tell you.

01:38:13.972 --> 01:38:15.724
Saroo.

01:38:17.183 --> 01:38:19.811
I really hope she's there.

01:38:23.315 --> 01:38:26.109
She needs to see
how beautiful you are.

01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.807
Hey.

01:42:25.932 --> 01:42:27.350
I used to live here.

01:42:29.644 --> 01:42:32.522
I used to...

01:42:32.647 --> 01:42:33.731
Can I help?

01:42:34.816 --> 01:42:36.568
Um... uh...

01:42:37.610 --> 01:42:38.486
That's me.

01:42:38.611 --> 01:42:40.071
I'm Saroo.

01:42:40.196 --> 01:42:41.197
I used to live here.

01:42:41.322 --> 01:42:42.532
You lived here?

01:42:42.657 --> 01:42:44.367
Here, yes.
Yeah, I used to live here.

01:42:44.492 --> 01:42:49.164
I'm-I'm looking for, uh...
Guddu, Kallu, uh, Shekila.

01:42:49.289 --> 01:42:50.582
My mother.

01:43:24.490 --> 01:43:25.491
Come.

01:43:25.617 --> 01:43:29.162
- Come where?
- Come with me.

01:43:29.287 --> 01:43:31.372
Just come.

01:45:07.051 --> 01:45:08.428
<i>Ammi?</i>

01:45:09.512 --> 01:45:10.596
Saroo!

01:45:16.102 --> 01:45:18.229
Saroo. Saroo.

01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:27.697
Oh, how I looked for you!

01:45:29.991 --> 01:45:32.702
- Saroo. Saroo. Saroo.
- Sorry.

01:45:33.828 --> 01:45:35.246
Saroo.

01:45:36.873 --> 01:45:38.916
Saroo.

01:45:39.042 --> 01:45:41.002
I'm sorry.

01:45:42.045 --> 01:45:44.339
I'm so sorry.

01:45:51.596 --> 01:45:52.930
It's okay.

01:45:58.353 --> 01:46:00.229
Yeah? The watermelons.

01:46:00.563 --> 01:46:01.647
<i>Watermelon.</i>

01:46:01.773 --> 01:46:02.773
Yeah.

01:46:10.865 --> 01:46:12.408
Saroo.

01:46:24.754 --> 01:46:26.005
And Guddu?

01:46:27.048 --> 01:46:28.048
Where's Guddu?

01:46:31.844 --> 01:46:34.597
- Where is he?
- Guddu...

01:46:38.851 --> 01:46:40.520
Guddu is no more.

01:46:40.645 --> 01:46:43.064
He's with God.

01:46:47.568 --> 01:46:49.362
Guddu.

01:47:34.574 --> 01:47:36.993
- Shekila.
- Shekila?

01:47:37.118 --> 01:47:39.704
Shekila?

01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:42.748
He's your brother!

01:47:42.874 --> 01:47:44.459
She's so big.

01:47:44.584 --> 01:47:45.960
It's me, Saroo.

01:47:47.044 --> 01:47:49.046
She's beautiful.

01:48:44.018 --> 01:48:45.770
<i>Hi, Mum.</i>

01:48:45.895 --> 01:48:47.855
<i>I know you'll be sound asleep.</i>

01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:50.608
<i>I just want to say
that I'm safe.</i>

01:48:50.733 --> 01:48:53.653
<i>I'm safe, and the questions
have been answered.</i>

01:48:55.905 --> 01:48:57.907
<i>There are no more dead ends.</i>

01:48:59.116 --> 01:49:01.410
<i>I've found my mother, and...</i>

01:49:01.536 --> 01:49:04.580
<i>she thanks you both
for raising me.</i>

01:49:04.705 --> 01:49:06.874
<i>She understands
that you're my family.</i>

01:49:06.999 --> 01:49:08.125
<i>She's...</i>

01:49:09.794 --> 01:49:12.380
...happy just knowing I'm alive.

01:49:15.216 --> 01:49:17.885
I've found her, but that
doesn't change who you are.

01:49:19.512 --> 01:49:22.598
I love you, Mum, so much.

01:49:22.723 --> 01:49:25.601
And you, Dad.

01:49:25.726 --> 01:49:27.603
And Mantosh.

01:50:39.342 --> 01:50:40.718
C'mon!

01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:42.928
Let's go!

01:50:45.556 --> 01:50:47.308
Come on!

01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:00.279
Saroo!

01:51:02.281 --> 01:51:03.908
Let's go!

01:51:04.158 --> 01:51:05.701
Walk faster!

01:51:06.786 --> 01:51:11.374
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!

01:51:11.666 --> 01:51:14.251
Oh, you're gonna fall!

01:52:24.321 --> 01:52:27.742
<i>- Saroo!

01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:22.971
<i>- Saroo!
- Guddu!</i>
