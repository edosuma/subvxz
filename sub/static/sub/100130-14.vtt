WEBVTT

00:10.609 --> 00:12.406
- Great party.
- Thanks. Drive carefully.

00:12.609 --> 00:13.803
Good night.

00:17.929 --> 00:20.124
Great party.
We should do this more often.

00:20.289 --> 00:24.043
Yeah, maybe next time
we can trim the guest list by one.

00:24.209 --> 00:27.645
Piper, I had to invite Leo. He was at
the club when I picked up the supplies.

00:27.809 --> 00:29.242
He knew that we were
throwing a party.

00:29.449 --> 00:32.805
Well, didn't you think maybe he'd feel
a little bit awkward because of Dan?

00:33.849 --> 00:36.317
Doesn't look like
he feels too awkward to me.

00:36.729 --> 00:39.960
Look, Piper, he's been mortal for what,
a couple of weeks now?

00:40.129 --> 00:41.801
I felt bad for him.
He doesn't know anybody.

00:41.969 --> 00:43.243
And it's not like there's

00:43.409 --> 00:45.798
a fallen-whitelighter support group
to join or anything.

00:46.009 --> 00:49.684
Prue, I'm not upset with you.
I'm just upset with the whole situation.

00:49.849 --> 00:54.320
Well, Leo is just gonna have to accept
the fact that you're with Dan now.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.639
You are still with Dan, right?

00:56.809 --> 00:59.323
Yes, of course.

01:00.569 --> 01:02.400
What do you think they're
talking about?

01:02.569 --> 01:04.685
- You.
- Great.

01:05.369 --> 01:06.563
Hey, you guys.

01:06.769 --> 01:08.919
Give me a break.
It's after midnight. I have midterms.

01:09.129 --> 01:11.199
Sorry, Pheebs, didn't realize
we were being so loud.

01:11.369 --> 01:13.325
Why don't you take a study break,
clear your head.

01:13.529 --> 01:15.963
I can't, I have too many phobias.

01:16.169 --> 01:17.807
To learn about, for my psych exam.

01:17.969 --> 01:19.322
I had no idea there were so many:

01:19.489 --> 01:24.279
Claustrophobia, arachnophobia,
kleptophobia, phallus-phobia.

01:24.489 --> 01:26.445
- "Relaxaphobia."
- Cute.

01:26.649 --> 01:28.560
- Just trying to help.
- Help by keeping it down.

01:28.729 --> 01:31.562
- Did I mention it's after midnight?
- Twice.

01:31.769 --> 01:34.442
- Party's breaking up anyway.
- Thank you.

01:39.049 --> 01:41.244
What the hell are they talking about?

01:41.449 --> 01:43.644
My favourite ball player?
Joe DiMaggio, hands down.

01:43.849 --> 01:45.168
I meant when you were
growing up.

01:45.609 --> 01:47.679
DiMaggio was...

01:47.889 --> 01:50.722
...my grandfather's favourite.
That's why he's mine too.

01:51.169 --> 01:53.524
You know, Leo,
this is just an observation,

01:53.689 --> 01:55.998
but you don't like to talk about
your past too much, do you?

01:56.369 --> 01:59.281
It's just not all that interesting, really.

01:59.489 --> 02:02.640
Not that interesting? I mean, being
in the Army sounds pretty interesting.

02:02.809 --> 02:05.448
I mean, how long you been out?

02:05.649 --> 02:07.048
- Piper.
- Hi, guys. Having fun?

02:07.209 --> 02:08.687
Not talking about me
too much, I hope.

02:08.889 --> 02:10.208
No, no, not at all.

02:10.929 --> 02:12.521
No?

02:12.729 --> 02:15.846
Actually, Leo was about to fill me in
on his Army experience.

02:16.009 --> 02:17.727
The Army?

02:19.489 --> 02:22.242
Look at the time. Gotta call it a night.
Party's over.

02:23.729 --> 02:26.926
- Goodnight, everybody.
- Finally.

02:30.649 --> 02:33.880
- You guys be safe tonight.
- Thank you.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:49.289 --> 02:52.087
Okay, I asked you guys once
to keep it down...

03:25.089 --> 03:26.078
Phoebe?

03:29.409 --> 03:31.240
Phoebe?

03:32.089 --> 03:34.205
Hey, are you all right?

03:37.569 --> 03:39.799
Yeah. I think so.

03:40.009 --> 03:43.126
- What happened?
- I don't know.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.325
But I'd sure like to find out.

05:12.289 --> 05:14.007
Thanks.

05:14.169 --> 05:16.444
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm fine, really.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.322
You're lucky. Falling down like that,
you could've hurt yourself.

05:19.969 --> 05:22.767
Maybe we should call it a night, huh?
Let her get some rest?

05:24.049 --> 05:26.438
- Okay. I'll walk you out.
- Okay.

05:29.089 --> 05:31.808
Hey, Leo. Coming?

05:31.969 --> 05:34.802
No, he has to stay here and...

05:34.969 --> 05:36.925
Take glasses back to P3.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.006
Now? At this hour?

05:39.169 --> 05:40.761
I'm a tough boss. Ready?

05:40.969 --> 05:44.359
- Nice chatting with you.
- Yeah, you too.

05:53.569 --> 05:54.888
Well, I thought he'd never leave.

05:55.089 --> 05:57.159
What the hell were you two
chatting about all night?

05:57.369 --> 05:58.802
Piper, do you mind?

05:58.969 --> 06:01.927
Phoebe, so, what really happened?

06:02.089 --> 06:04.523
Okay, I heard what I thought
were party noises,

06:04.729 --> 06:09.439
so I came downstairs to check
and to yell at you guys,

06:09.609 --> 06:14.046
and I was attacked
by something invisible.

06:14.209 --> 06:15.642
So, what, like, a ghost?

06:16.809 --> 06:18.640
I didn't sense another being.

06:18.809 --> 06:24.247
It was more, I don't know,
like a daydream, I guess.

06:24.409 --> 06:26.843
A daydream? Since when
do daydreams attack people?

06:27.129 --> 06:31.441
It wasn't really an attack,
it was more...

06:34.489 --> 06:35.638
...of a seduction.

06:35.849 --> 06:37.965
- Interesting daydream.
- Yeah.

06:38.169 --> 06:40.239
So I guess the question is,
what was it?

06:40.729 --> 06:42.959
Have you ever run across
anything like this?

06:43.129 --> 06:45.643
- I mean, as a whitelighter?
- Not really.

06:45.849 --> 06:49.319
Which means we have no idea
if it's going to strike again or not.

06:52.409 --> 06:53.524
This is so embarrassing.

06:53.689 --> 06:55.759
I haven't needed my big sister
to walk me to school

06:55.929 --> 06:57.123
since the first grade.

06:57.289 --> 06:58.324
Yeah, well, get used to it.

06:58.489 --> 07:00.719
Until we figure out what happened,
we're your bodyguards.

07:00.889 --> 07:03.278
How do you know
that you don't need the bodyguard?

07:03.449 --> 07:05.360
How do you know
that he won't come after you next?

07:05.529 --> 07:09.966
Well, because from your description,
it sounded very intimate.

07:10.129 --> 07:13.599
It makes me think that yours
is the only body it's interested in.

07:13.769 --> 07:17.762
Hey, you know, are you sure
that you're up for taking this exam?

07:17.929 --> 07:20.443
I can't let stuff like this
keep me from living my life.

07:20.609 --> 07:22.520
Otherwise I'd never
leave the house, you know?

07:22.689 --> 07:24.486
True.

07:25.449 --> 07:27.963
You're not gonna sit beside me
while I take this test.

07:28.129 --> 07:29.926
- I'm not?
- No, you are not.

07:30.489 --> 07:33.128
You're gonna wait patiently out here
until I'm done. Please?

07:33.369 --> 07:35.929
All right, but if anything
weird happens, yell.

07:36.129 --> 07:37.448
Okay.

07:53.609 --> 07:55.327
- How's Phoebe?
- Fine, so far.

07:55.489 --> 07:57.480
She should be taking her midterm
as we speak.

07:57.689 --> 07:59.088
So no more attacks after I left?

07:59.289 --> 08:01.041
Prue and I took turns
watching her all night.

08:01.209 --> 08:03.962
- Nothing happened.
- Really?

08:04.249 --> 08:06.285
That's good.

08:06.849 --> 08:09.488
Wait a minute. I know that tone.
What's up? What do you know?

08:09.689 --> 08:12.328
- Nothing. Just...
- Just what?

08:12.929 --> 08:15.318
Come on, Leo, if this has anything
to do with what happened...

08:16.089 --> 08:18.478
It may not, I don't know. It's just...

08:18.649 --> 08:22.278
Look, I was up all night
trying to recall a similar situation

08:22.489 --> 08:25.606
another whitelighter had
with one of his charges.

08:27.089 --> 08:33.437
It had something to do with a past life
coming back to haunt her present one.

08:33.609 --> 08:35.565
- What?
- It's obviously very rare.

08:35.729 --> 08:37.481
It doesn't happen to most people.

08:37.649 --> 08:40.607
But if I remember right,
in this particular case,

08:40.769 --> 08:44.159
her past life was trying
to warn her present one.

08:44.329 --> 08:46.638
- Warn her. About what?
- I don't know.

08:46.809 --> 08:48.083
And that's what's so frustrating,

08:48.249 --> 08:50.968
because I don't have any way
of finding out, either.

08:51.129 --> 08:52.847
You miss being a whitelighter,
don't you?

08:53.529 --> 08:55.997
Yeah, at times like this, I do.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.763
When I know I can help.

08:59.849 --> 09:03.842
And also when I think
that I'm never gonna be with you.

09:06.929 --> 09:08.726
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

09:09.809 --> 09:12.164
Dan, hi. No, don't be silly.
We were just...

09:12.369 --> 09:13.848
Finished.

09:19.049 --> 09:21.438
What are you doing here?
I thought you had a job to bid.

09:21.609 --> 09:23.201
Well, I was on my way
back to the office.

09:23.529 --> 09:24.803
You know, crunch some numbers.

09:30.729 --> 09:32.845
If I ask you a question,
you promise you won't get mad?

09:33.009 --> 09:34.124
Depends on the question.

09:34.329 --> 09:37.366
How well do you really know Leo?
About where he's from, I mean.

09:38.009 --> 09:40.682
- Why do you ask?
- Believe me, this isn't a jealousy thing.

09:40.889 --> 09:44.848
I just wanna make sure you know
who's working for you, that's all.

09:45.009 --> 09:47.159
Just call me overprotective.

09:49.329 --> 09:52.082
That's very sweet, Dan, but trust me,

09:52.249 --> 09:54.479
you don't have to worry
about Leo at all.

09:54.649 --> 09:56.605
He's an angel.

10:13.609 --> 10:14.598
Phoebe.

10:15.089 --> 10:16.807
Is she all right?

10:21.929 --> 10:23.681
Are you okay?

10:28.849 --> 10:31.158
- What am I looking for?
- Anything to do with past lives.

10:31.489 --> 10:33.445
Potions, spells, incantations.

10:33.609 --> 10:35.839
There should be something
in the Book of Shadows about it.

10:36.049 --> 10:38.119
You think that this has to do
with Phoebe's past life?

10:38.329 --> 10:40.126
Well, that's how our souls evolve.

10:40.289 --> 10:42.644
How we grow as individuals,
from one lifetime to the next.

10:42.849 --> 10:44.965
Okay, then why is my past love
trying to kill me?

10:45.169 --> 10:47.399
I don't think it is.
I think it's trying to warn you.

10:47.609 --> 10:49.600
To give you a chance
to do something about it.

10:50.369 --> 10:51.882
Maybe it's because
you get premonitions.

10:52.329 --> 10:53.648
Wait, do something about what?

10:53.849 --> 10:57.080
About whatever happened before
that's endangering her now.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.849
Where's Shirley MacLaine
when you need her?

11:01.209 --> 11:03.518
Don't need her. We've got this.

11:03.729 --> 11:07.165
Leo's right. There's a spell
that will take you to that past life.

11:07.329 --> 11:09.684
Wait, we're not doing this.

11:12.409 --> 11:13.762
Looks like you don't have to.

11:14.809 --> 11:16.959
It's written in the first person.
I can do it alone.

11:17.249 --> 11:20.480
No, Phoebe, there's absolutely
no spell to bring you back.

11:20.649 --> 11:23.038
Which means she can probably
come back whenever she wants to.

11:23.209 --> 11:26.918
Probably? That's not good enough.
What if she can't?

11:27.129 --> 11:28.448
She'd be trapped in her past life,

11:28.609 --> 11:30.406
where something awful
may have happened to her.

11:30.609 --> 11:33.919
But if I don't go back, the same awful
thing could happen to me in this life.

11:34.129 --> 11:36.085
Fine, then we're going with you.

11:36.249 --> 11:39.047
We can't. Not according
to the way the spell is written.

11:39.249 --> 11:41.080
Only Phoebe can.

11:41.569 --> 11:44.288
I've just started
to turn my life around.

11:44.449 --> 11:47.009
I really don't want my past life
to ruin it for me now.

11:51.369 --> 11:55.647
Remove the chains of time and space
And make my spirit soar

11:55.849 --> 12:00.877
Let these mortals arms embrace
The life that haunts before

12:19.049 --> 12:21.483
- Did you have fun?
- It was a hoot.

12:28.489 --> 12:31.879
Thanks for the love potion.
Worked wonders.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.408
Welcome back.

13:00.729 --> 13:04.563
- Do you think she's all right?
- She looks all right so far.

13:31.529 --> 13:33.804
Well. I was wondering
where you went off to.

13:34.009 --> 13:35.158
I had to get some herbs.

13:35.329 --> 13:38.526
I can't very well make my potions
without them.

13:38.689 --> 13:41.157
Would you like me
to curse anyone for you?

13:41.329 --> 13:42.921
Maybe later.

13:46.449 --> 13:49.964
Hurry up with that giggle water, Jake,
we have thirsty people waiting.

13:54.249 --> 13:56.638
What's the matter, cousin?
You're not afraid of me, are you?

13:56.929 --> 14:00.717
- Should I be?
- My usual, and bring it to my booth.

14:00.889 --> 14:03.528
Could you tell your husband
to play something different?

14:03.689 --> 14:06.806
I'm bored with this old song.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.520
Don't worry about her, baby,
just keep playing.

14:18.729 --> 14:19.844
Anything for you.

14:40.369 --> 14:43.327
- Hello, cousin.
- We have to talk. Soon.

14:43.529 --> 14:45.485
We're done talking.

14:50.129 --> 14:52.165
Did you find the spell?

14:59.609 --> 15:01.998
Say these words:

15:02.209 --> 15:04.598
Christina Larson,
what in the devil are you doing?

15:04.769 --> 15:06.999
And you, get out of here.

15:07.809 --> 15:10.767
I told you to watch my things,
that's all.

15:11.929 --> 15:13.078
My dolly.

15:13.249 --> 15:16.878
Spells and charms are not toys,
Christina, do you understand me?

15:32.409 --> 15:34.684
I've been looking all over for you.

15:58.369 --> 16:01.088
Why must you tease me, Anton?

16:01.249 --> 16:02.921
Come with me.

16:13.129 --> 16:14.482
- Drink this.
- What is it?

16:14.689 --> 16:16.168
A potion to triple your power,

16:16.369 --> 16:18.678
in case your cousins
are ready for us.

16:19.449 --> 16:22.009
It's the only way for us to succeed.
You do want that, don't you?

16:26.369 --> 16:28.325
That's my girl.

16:32.609 --> 16:34.486
Go ahead, test it.

16:42.529 --> 16:44.599
- Okay, okay.
- Where am I?

16:44.809 --> 16:46.845
You're home, honey, you're home.
You're okay.

16:47.729 --> 16:51.085
- What happened?
- I was bad.

16:51.369 --> 16:54.361
Very, very bad.

17:02.329 --> 17:06.242
Okay, family tree.
I know I saw one someplace.

17:06.409 --> 17:08.127
I still don't understand.

17:08.329 --> 17:10.080
We were all related. Cousins.

17:10.249 --> 17:13.286
And we lived here at the manor
back in the '20s.

17:13.608 --> 17:16.406
Together, here?
So much for evolution.

17:16.569 --> 17:20.323
Wait, so you saw us in our past lives?
I mean, did we look the same?

17:21.729 --> 17:23.845
Yeah. You did, actually. Kind of.

17:25.009 --> 17:26.806
Well, they probably
looked the same to you

17:27.009 --> 17:29.728
because your soul
recognized their souls.

17:29.929 --> 17:32.648
I mean, we all tend to travel
in the same circle of family, friends,

17:32.809 --> 17:35.721
even enemies,
throughout our various lives.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.039
And that's why our souls
kind of recognize each other.

17:38.209 --> 17:40.120
So we can keep finding each other.

17:40.289 --> 17:42.041
That's what soul mates means.

17:42.849 --> 17:44.805
It was really weird
being back like that,

17:45.129 --> 17:47.484
because it wasn't like I had
any control over my actions.

17:47.649 --> 17:51.164
It was more like I was a visitor.
Watching, feeling.

17:51.369 --> 17:55.408
- Feeling bad?
- Feeling very, very bad.

17:56.769 --> 17:59.602
Okay, I admit it. I liked it.

17:59.769 --> 18:04.126
It felt good to be respected
and powerful.

18:04.329 --> 18:06.001
Hey, speaking of powers,

18:06.169 --> 18:09.206
how come I didn't get to keep
that kick-ass power I had back then?

18:09.609 --> 18:11.008
Well, if you screw up, you regress.

18:11.169 --> 18:12.682
Your past self
must've abused the power.

18:12.849 --> 18:14.328
That's why it was
taken away from you.

18:14.529 --> 18:17.248
That's too bad,
because it was hot, literally.

18:17.449 --> 18:20.247
Yeah, apparently that isn't
the only thing that was really hot.

18:21.769 --> 18:23.919
Yeah. Anton was hot too.

18:24.129 --> 18:28.327
Oh, and he was such a good kisser.
And so good with his hands.

18:28.489 --> 18:30.639
Hands that very well
may have killed you.

18:30.809 --> 18:33.482
Maybe. But, you know,
it also could've been past Dan.

18:33.929 --> 18:35.362
Dan? As in my Dan?

18:37.129 --> 18:38.721
- You saw him too?
- He was your husband.

18:39.009 --> 18:40.522
- Sorry, Leo.
- That's okay.

18:40.689 --> 18:42.486
I'm hoping Piper learns
from her past mistakes.

18:46.489 --> 18:49.322
Prue, this was the camera
that you used in your past life.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.643
Wait, l...? I was a photographer?

18:52.809 --> 18:54.800
Yeah, and apparently
a really good one,

18:54.969 --> 18:58.006
because people were lining up
to get their portraits taken.

18:58.169 --> 18:59.397
Really?

18:59.569 --> 19:01.799
So any idea what kind of power I had?

19:01.969 --> 19:05.120
I don't know, but whatever it was,
it must've been pretty powerful,

19:05.289 --> 19:06.802
because Anton had to triple mine.

19:06.969 --> 19:08.800
I found it. The family tree.

19:14.489 --> 19:16.764
And there we are at the bottom.

19:16.969 --> 19:18.800
Right, there's Mom and Grams.

19:19.009 --> 19:21.603
Okay, and this must be us again,
three cousins.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.441
Yeah, but which one is which?

19:24.529 --> 19:26.360
Wait a minute.
What's the date today?

19:26.849 --> 19:29.124
February 17th.

19:29.289 --> 19:31.678
I think that this one is me.

19:31.969 --> 19:35.803
She died February 17th, 1924.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.318
The same age I am, also.

19:38.529 --> 19:41.680
Certainly explains why the warnings
are happening today.

19:43.089 --> 19:47.605
So that doesn't mean
that I'm gonna die today too, right?

19:48.969 --> 19:51.278
We have to figure out
what happened, fast.

19:51.609 --> 19:53.998
Wait, what was
that little girl's name?

19:54.489 --> 19:56.127
Christina... Christina...

19:56.289 --> 19:57.802
Christina Larson.

19:57.969 --> 20:00.085
Christina Larson. Maybe she
can remember what happened.

20:00.249 --> 20:04.037
- Can you say "long shot"?
- Well, it's the only shot I got, Prue.

20:04.249 --> 20:07.446
I will call Darryl, and maybe
the police can track her down.

20:07.649 --> 20:11.039
I just hope she's forgotten
what I did to her doll.

20:11.809 --> 20:14.323
My dolly. You broke my dolly.

20:14.649 --> 20:18.642
No, that wasn't me, it was just
someone that looked like me, sort of.

20:18.849 --> 20:20.077
It's hard to explain.

20:20.289 --> 20:22.405
At least she recognizes your soul.
That's a good sign.

20:22.689 --> 20:25.681
Just let her know that you're
the good Phoebe, not the bad one.

20:30.249 --> 20:32.809
You don't have
to be afraid of me anymore.

20:33.009 --> 20:35.159
I'm not gonna hurt you, I promise.

20:37.409 --> 20:39.001
Ms. Larson, we need your help.

20:41.129 --> 20:45.884
Do you remember, when you were
a little girl, back in 1924,

20:46.449 --> 20:49.088
you used to go to a speakeasy
that was run by three cousins.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.841
Do you remember that?

20:51.009 --> 20:52.567
Daddy was a bartender.

20:52.969 --> 20:55.642
He used to pick me up
after school and take me there.

20:56.329 --> 20:58.718
I liked the piano.

21:07.769 --> 21:10.761
The girl that looked like me,
do you remember her?

21:12.689 --> 21:14.520
She was an evil witch.

21:16.289 --> 21:19.520
I used to hide upstairs
by the landing.

21:19.689 --> 21:21.042
I saw everything.

21:21.769 --> 21:24.283
Did you see anything bad happen
to the evil witch?

21:24.489 --> 21:26.844
Oh, it was scary.

21:27.609 --> 21:30.567
Fire and screaming.

21:31.089 --> 21:32.078
And then...

21:33.449 --> 21:34.643
...you were murdered.

21:35.889 --> 21:37.720
Do you remember
who murdered me?

21:37.929 --> 21:39.203
Was it a man named Anton?

21:41.209 --> 21:43.803
It was such a pretty necklace.

21:44.009 --> 21:47.126
Just ripped it off of the bad witch.

21:47.449 --> 21:48.962
And then strangled her.

21:49.169 --> 21:50.807
Who strangled the evil witch?

21:52.609 --> 21:55.123
That was my favourite dolly.

21:55.529 --> 21:57.406
I'm so sorry.

22:07.569 --> 22:08.922
Well, bright side:

22:09.129 --> 22:10.721
At least I won't worry
about ending up

22:10.889 --> 22:12.402
in a place like this
in my golden years.

22:13.049 --> 22:15.438
Hey, at least we still have time
to figure out what happened.

22:15.649 --> 22:18.038
Not much time. By midnight,
I'll be dead again.

22:18.249 --> 22:19.364
How do you know that?

22:19.569 --> 22:21.321
Midnight, a full moon,
what's the difference?

22:21.489 --> 22:23.480
It's always one or the other, right?

22:23.689 --> 22:26.567
I know I won't make it
till February 18th, unless...

22:26.769 --> 22:28.760
You go back to the past again
and find some answers.

22:35.289 --> 22:36.802
Whatever you do,
make sure you get back

22:36.969 --> 22:38.288
before your past life gets killed,

22:38.449 --> 22:40.246
otherwise we may not be able
to wake you up.

22:40.449 --> 22:43.122
Don't worry, dying is one experience
I don't plan on reliving.

22:43.329 --> 22:44.762
Are you sure you wanna
do this again?

22:45.209 --> 22:46.358
No.

22:48.729 --> 22:50.162
But here goes.

22:50.889 --> 22:53.847
Remove the chains of time and space
And make my spirit soar

22:54.449 --> 22:58.522
Let these mortal arms embrace
The life that haunts before

23:04.889 --> 23:07.323
Feels good to be bad, doesn't it?

23:07.969 --> 23:09.880
Sometimes.

23:11.529 --> 23:13.645
Second thoughts?

23:13.809 --> 23:14.878
They're my cousins, Anton.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.522
They're good witches, my love,

23:16.689 --> 23:18.520
which is why I gave you
this amulet to wear.

23:18.929 --> 23:21.921
It protects you from their witchcraft
so they can never harm you.

23:22.129 --> 23:23.608
Hey.

23:23.769 --> 23:26.329
Killing them is the only way
for me to get their powers.

23:26.489 --> 23:31.119
And once I have them,
together, we will be unstoppable.

23:38.769 --> 23:41.761
First things first.
Are you ready?

23:42.449 --> 23:44.405
Good. Now, remember,

23:44.569 --> 23:46.878
wait until after I lure your cousin
away from her piano man

23:47.049 --> 23:48.243
before you make your move.

23:49.089 --> 23:51.557
- How you gonna do that?
- Easy.

23:51.729 --> 23:54.163
By posing as her former lover.

23:55.369 --> 23:57.439
And fighting through her power.

23:58.689 --> 24:01.157
- Shall we?
- Let's.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.569
What are you doing here?

24:32.449 --> 24:34.041
Just missing you, baby.

24:34.209 --> 24:36.086
Stop it, we can't do this anymore.

24:36.449 --> 24:38.360
What is the matter with you?
This isn't like you.

24:38.569 --> 24:41.083
You're right. It's not.

24:47.649 --> 24:49.640
Do you wanna talk now?

24:49.969 --> 24:51.118
Upstairs?

25:14.889 --> 25:16.402
I'm gonna like having that power.

25:26.409 --> 25:28.639
How does it feel
to be powerless against me?

25:44.009 --> 25:46.045
- Hurry!
- Run!

25:56.809 --> 26:00.722
- We know Anton's a warlock.
- And that he's fallen in love with you.

26:00.889 --> 26:03.084
- And turned you evil.
- We can't have you join forces.

26:03.249 --> 26:05.399
- Not in this life, not in any life.
- God, forgive us.

26:05.569 --> 26:06.797
Evil witch, in my sight

26:07.009 --> 26:09.125
Vanquish thyself
Vanquish thy might

26:09.329 --> 26:11.285
In this and every future life

26:18.089 --> 26:20.444
- Phoebe, what?
- You.

26:22.569 --> 26:25.367
You were the ones
that were trying to kill me.

26:32.569 --> 26:35.447
Phoebe, don't be ridiculous.
You know we'd never hurt you.

26:35.609 --> 26:38.203
No? Tell that to past Phoebe.
You cursed her.

26:38.369 --> 26:39.358
Phoebe, come on.

26:39.609 --> 26:43.363
Hey. They didn't try to kill you, Phoebe.
You know that. It was their past selves.

26:43.529 --> 26:44.678
I know.

26:44.849 --> 26:47.238
And it was my past self
that tried to kill them first.

26:58.849 --> 27:01.522
Phoebe, whatever happened,
you can't blame yourself.

27:01.689 --> 27:03.407
It wasn't really you.

27:03.569 --> 27:05.639
But that's the thing.

27:05.809 --> 27:07.003
It was me.

27:07.169 --> 27:09.729
Or at least a part of me
that I can relate to.

27:10.409 --> 27:13.321
And I don't mean hurting you guys,
I can't even imagine that,

27:13.529 --> 27:15.997
but being in my past life,

27:16.209 --> 27:20.805
that powerful evil feeling, it was...

27:20.969 --> 27:23.005
It was seductive.
And that's what scares me.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.961
I mean, what if
that's who I really am?

27:25.129 --> 27:28.565
But that's not who you are, Phoebe,
not in this life.

27:28.729 --> 27:32.768
I mean, you... You've evolved,
you've grown. You're good now.

27:33.129 --> 27:36.838
I was good then too, before I...

27:37.369 --> 27:40.964
Before she turned.
Before she fell in love with Anton.

27:41.129 --> 27:43.165
Who, surprise, was a warlock.

27:44.449 --> 27:45.882
Oh, and that's not the only surprise.

27:46.049 --> 27:49.405
Anton could glamour into looking like
anyone he wanted to.

27:49.569 --> 27:53.642
That's how he lured past Piper.
He glamoured into her former lover.

27:53.809 --> 27:55.640
Her former lover? Who was that?

27:55.849 --> 27:57.999
It was me.

27:58.209 --> 27:59.961
Or, rather, past me.

28:00.889 --> 28:02.766
- Him?
- Yeah.

28:02.929 --> 28:05.762
- Hey, how did you know that?
- Yeah, how did you know that?

28:05.929 --> 28:07.123
When you become a whitelighter,

28:07.289 --> 28:09.723
they let you see your past lives,
for perspective.

28:09.929 --> 28:12.284
No wonder he knows so much stuff
about this.

28:12.489 --> 28:13.524
Hold it. Wait a minute.

28:13.689 --> 28:16.601
You knew that we were lovers before
and you didn't tell me?

28:17.129 --> 28:18.642
What, did it just slip your mind?

28:18.849 --> 28:20.441
- No, I just...
- You just what?

28:21.449 --> 28:22.438
I'm getting a migraine.

28:22.609 --> 28:25.521
I didn't tell you because I didn't want it
to influence you in the present.

28:25.729 --> 28:28.721
I wanted you to decide whether or not
you wanted me in this life.

28:28.889 --> 28:29.878
I need an aspirin.

28:30.089 --> 28:32.319
Okay, hey, can we get back
to my problem

28:32.529 --> 28:34.599
since, at best, I only have
till midnight to live?

28:34.809 --> 28:36.083
Right, sorry.

28:36.649 --> 28:38.287
We will talk later.

28:38.489 --> 28:40.320
I understand how
past Phoebe was killed,

28:40.489 --> 28:42.366
but not why killing her
is going to kill you.

28:42.529 --> 28:43.803
Because of the curse.

28:43.969 --> 28:47.166
The cousins didn't wanna risk
past Phoebe and Anton

28:47.329 --> 28:50.127
getting back together again
in any lifetime.

28:50.489 --> 28:54.368
Anton was... Is immortal.

28:55.209 --> 28:58.645
And I guess that they thought
that he and Phoebe were soul mates.

28:58.849 --> 29:02.319
So he's still alive, running around
out there somewhere?

29:02.529 --> 29:03.518
The immediate question is

29:03.689 --> 29:05.884
how do we protect Phoebe
from her past life?

29:06.049 --> 29:07.767
The amulet could protect me.

29:07.969 --> 29:11.006
- What amulet?
- The one that Anton gave Phoebe.

29:11.209 --> 29:13.120
I wonder if Christina
knows where it is.

29:13.329 --> 29:15.206
Seventy-six years later?
I don't think so.

29:15.409 --> 29:16.728
We probably have a better chance

29:16.889 --> 29:18.800
of looking in the Book of Shadows
under "Anton"

29:18.969 --> 29:22.359
and seeing where he got
the amulet in the first place.

29:22.529 --> 29:24.360
Yeah, good.
You guys go check that out,

29:24.529 --> 29:27.441
and I'm just gonna run downstairs and
grab something to eat. I'm starving.

29:27.649 --> 29:29.958
Okay, we'll meet you downstairs.

29:32.849 --> 29:34.248
Leo, wait.

29:34.769 --> 29:37.522
I want you to come with me
to the retirement home.

29:37.969 --> 29:40.767
- What about your sisters?
- I don't want them there.

29:42.249 --> 29:45.127
If I don't find the amulet...

29:45.289 --> 29:47.803
...l'm gonna die, Leo.

29:48.009 --> 29:49.840
And I don't want them to see that.

29:52.609 --> 29:55.282
If Anton is still around
and truly in love with Phoebe,

29:55.449 --> 29:56.802
he's going to be looking for her.

29:56.969 --> 29:59.483
Yeah, I know. But right now,
that is the least of our problems.

29:59.649 --> 30:03.324
We need to find something, anything,
to save Phoebe.

30:03.929 --> 30:05.760
Where's Leo?

30:09.169 --> 30:10.841
Christina?

30:11.849 --> 30:13.999
Hi, it's Phoebe.

30:14.169 --> 30:16.524
I'm sorry to bother you again,

30:16.689 --> 30:20.364
but I need your help with something.
It's really important.

30:21.369 --> 30:25.328
I need you to try to remember
back to the day that the bad witch died

30:25.489 --> 30:27.719
and the pretty necklace
was torn off her neck.

30:27.889 --> 30:30.403
Do you remember that day?

30:30.609 --> 30:35.160
Christina, I know this is difficult,
but please try.

30:35.369 --> 30:37.007
Phoebe's life depends on it.

30:37.209 --> 30:40.519
Do you remember what happened
to the necklace, Christina?

30:42.489 --> 30:46.641
I was up on the landing,
watching the whole scary thing.

30:47.409 --> 30:49.445
And the necklace?

30:49.609 --> 30:52.442
It just slid across the floor
into the foyer.

30:54.809 --> 30:58.518
Damn it. We're never
gonna find it this way.

30:58.689 --> 31:01.157
Maybe, maybe not.

31:02.209 --> 31:05.042
Leo, do you think
that I could write a spell

31:05.209 --> 31:06.961
that could not only send me
back to the past,

31:07.129 --> 31:09.404
but give me complete control
over my actions as well?

31:09.569 --> 31:10.558
I don't know, why?

31:10.729 --> 31:11.844
Because if I can,

31:12.009 --> 31:13.840
I could go back to the past
and find the amulet

31:14.009 --> 31:16.921
and hide it someplace safe so I know
where to find it in the present.

31:17.129 --> 31:20.326
The only way to do that would be
to switch life forces with past Phoebe.

31:21.209 --> 31:22.961
In other words,
you would be in 1924

31:23.129 --> 31:25.438
and evil Phoebe would be right here,
in your body.

31:25.649 --> 31:27.958
But long enough for me
to find the amulet and switch back.

31:28.169 --> 31:29.522
Yeah, but if something goes wrong,

31:29.689 --> 31:32.442
we risk unleashing
a powerful evil witch in the present

31:32.609 --> 31:34.008
and losing you in the past.

31:34.529 --> 31:37.885
But if we don't do anything, Leo,
we're gonna lose me anyway.

31:38.769 --> 31:41.203
I have to find the amulet.
It's my only hope.

31:51.289 --> 31:54.167
You do realize you won't look
any different to them.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.604
They'll still think you're evil Phoebe
and try to kill you.

31:57.929 --> 32:00.762
Leo, don't worry so much.

32:00.929 --> 32:04.478
You're mortal now.
You'll get wrinkles.

32:15.929 --> 32:19.444
In this time and in this place
Take the spirit I displace

32:20.129 --> 32:25.249
Bring it forth while I go back
To inhabit a soul so black

32:32.209 --> 32:35.599
No! Wait!

32:44.009 --> 32:46.477
- Where'd she learn that?
- I don't know.

32:47.249 --> 32:49.365
Okay. The amulet.

32:49.529 --> 32:51.485
Where is the amulet?

32:54.249 --> 32:56.809
Why is she running from us?
Why isn't she just using her power?

32:56.969 --> 33:00.518
She's probably trying to lure us
into another trap.

33:04.769 --> 33:06.805
Phoebe, are you all right?

33:09.809 --> 33:14.724
- Are you there?
- Here, there, everywhere.

33:24.769 --> 33:25.884
What?

33:40.169 --> 33:46.039
If you were the only
Girl in the world

33:47.049 --> 33:51.679
And I were the only boy...

34:02.289 --> 34:04.405
Wake up, my sweet.

34:07.209 --> 34:10.679
- Anton, what's going on?
- It's okay.

34:10.889 --> 34:13.880
- Where am I?
- You've been reincarnated.

34:14.049 --> 34:16.483
Reborn.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.246
To me.

34:31.369 --> 34:32.848
I'm not who you think I am.

34:33.009 --> 34:35.364
I'm a different me,
a me from another lifetime

34:35.569 --> 34:40.597
where we've evolved into sisters.
Good sisters, happy sisters.

34:40.809 --> 34:42.925
Must've cut off too much blood
to her brain.

34:43.089 --> 34:45.444
- Must have.
- Screw this.

34:45.649 --> 34:48.721
In this time and in this place
Take the spirit I displace

34:48.889 --> 34:53.121
Bring me forth while she goes back
To a soul so black

35:04.129 --> 35:05.801
Here you go, Ms. Larson,
try taking a sip.

35:08.809 --> 35:10.083
Thank you, my dear.

35:10.929 --> 35:12.885
The nurse will be right in.
Is she okay?

35:13.369 --> 35:15.439
Yeah, I'll be fine, thanks for asking.

35:15.649 --> 35:17.241
You're not getting any sympathy
out of me.

35:17.409 --> 35:19.923
You should never have let Phoebe
cast that spell.

35:21.609 --> 35:23.122
Ms. Larson, can I get you
anything else?

35:23.329 --> 35:27.288
- Some Jell-O would be nice.
- Some Jell-O.

35:27.489 --> 35:29.525
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

35:29.689 --> 35:32.328
Will you excuse me for a second?

35:33.849 --> 35:36.522
I don't think she has any idea
what happened.

35:36.729 --> 35:39.038
Well, that makes two of us.
Do we really believe that Anton

35:39.209 --> 35:42.121
knew all along that Phoebe was gonna
come here looking for Christina?

35:42.289 --> 35:44.564
Well, Christina is the only living link.

35:45.089 --> 35:46.442
It was his only hope.

35:46.849 --> 35:49.317
Who cares how he knew. We need
to get our Phoebe back, and fast.

35:49.489 --> 35:51.923
The problem is she's the only one
who can say the spell.

35:52.089 --> 35:56.241
And also, with evil Phoebe wearing
the amulet, she's protected from it.

35:56.769 --> 35:58.282
We've gotta get the amulet off of her.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.400
But only long enough
for Phoebe to switch lives.

36:00.809 --> 36:02.640
She has to be wearing
the amulet in the present

36:02.809 --> 36:05.562
to protect her
from the past-life curse.

36:05.729 --> 36:08.766
Okay, so bottom line:
Get evil Phoebe, get the amulet.

36:08.929 --> 36:10.442
Any questions?
Okay, good. Let's hurry.

36:10.849 --> 36:12.567
- Hurry where?
- Back to the manor.

36:12.729 --> 36:14.720
If Anton and evil Phoebe reunited,

36:14.889 --> 36:17.847
then I have a feeling they're gonna
wanna pick up right where they left off:

36:18.009 --> 36:19.647
Trying to kill us.

36:34.449 --> 36:36.565
In this time and in this place

36:36.729 --> 36:38.048
There you are.

36:44.049 --> 36:45.607
You are too good to be true.

36:46.529 --> 36:47.723
Thanks for reminding me.

36:53.849 --> 36:55.328
Got her.

36:56.089 --> 36:58.159
Maybe they're not here.

36:58.329 --> 37:00.604
Oh, they're here. Somewhere.

37:02.089 --> 37:04.239
Didn't I tell you they'd come?

37:04.649 --> 37:05.877
Hello, cousins.

37:08.049 --> 37:09.323
Or is it sisters now?

37:14.729 --> 37:16.162
The amulet's protecting
both of them.

37:20.489 --> 37:22.207
It's your turn to die this time.

37:27.529 --> 37:29.838
We have to figure out a way
to get that amulet off of her.

37:30.049 --> 37:31.562
Yeah, great. Any idea how?

37:36.369 --> 37:38.644
In this time and in this place

37:42.809 --> 37:44.765
- Hi. How's it going?
- Behind you.

38:02.169 --> 38:04.729
- Sorry, Pheebs.
- Get the amulet.

38:09.409 --> 38:14.039
She goes back to her soul so black

38:22.049 --> 38:23.607
Piper? Prue?

38:23.809 --> 38:25.959
Okay, it's her. Put it back on, fast.

38:32.809 --> 38:35.039
- It's okay.
- You're safe.

38:37.049 --> 38:41.201
Thank you, guys, for saving my life.

38:42.289 --> 38:44.405
All of them.

38:49.089 --> 38:52.445
So I hope that you're not
still upset with me,

38:52.729 --> 38:56.165
you know, for not telling you
about our past lives together.

38:56.489 --> 38:58.684
I'm not letting you
off the hook for that just yet.

38:58.849 --> 39:00.840
I'm still not quite sure
what it even means.

39:01.969 --> 39:06.406
Well, I like to think it means
we're destined to be together.

39:08.889 --> 39:09.924
Saved by the bell.

39:11.809 --> 39:13.037
Or not.

39:14.649 --> 39:17.959
- Leo. What are you doing here?
- Leo was just leaving.

39:19.889 --> 39:23.598
- Bye.
- Okay, I'll see you at work. Dan.

39:29.649 --> 39:31.480
You know, I'm gonna
come right out and say this,

39:31.689 --> 39:33.168
even if you get mad at me,

39:33.369 --> 39:36.088
but I know in my gut
that something's not right with him.

39:36.249 --> 39:39.286
He worries me, I mean, just for you.

39:39.449 --> 39:42.919
- Are you talking about Leo?
- If Leo is his real name.

39:44.089 --> 39:46.398
I had my brother-in-law who works
for the State Department

39:46.569 --> 39:48.207
check on his Army records,

39:48.369 --> 39:50.360
but the only Leo Wyatt
they came up with

39:50.529 --> 39:52.679
died almost 60 years ago
in World War II.

39:52.889 --> 39:54.607
Well, there must be
some kind of mistake.

39:54.809 --> 39:59.200
Piper, there is no record
of him anywhere, nothing.

39:59.369 --> 40:01.564
It's almost as if he didn't have
any past at all.

40:03.129 --> 40:05.484
I'm sorry, I just...

40:06.969 --> 40:08.607
Just...

40:09.809 --> 40:11.561
Just do me a favour

40:11.729 --> 40:13.685
and watch your back
when you're around him, okay?

40:13.889 --> 40:17.598
At least until I find out
who he really is.

40:18.529 --> 40:22.317
- Okay.
- Well, I gotta go.

40:23.529 --> 40:24.962
Goodbye.

40:30.209 --> 40:32.245
Hey. You all right?

40:32.449 --> 40:36.158
Yeah, I think so. I'm just writing a little
warning in the Book about Anton.

40:36.369 --> 40:38.280
Why, you don't think
we actually vanquished him?

40:38.489 --> 40:40.605
I don't wanna take any chances.

40:40.889 --> 40:44.404
I just hope my future me is somewhere
near this book if he ever strikes again.

40:44.689 --> 40:46.884
Something tells me that we're always
gonna be near it,

40:47.049 --> 40:49.722
always have been, always will be.

40:49.889 --> 40:52.244
Yeah, you're probably right.

40:52.409 --> 40:54.684
Of course, the warning
won't do much good

40:54.849 --> 40:56.282
if the future me turns out to be bad.

40:57.449 --> 41:00.998
It's not just you, you know, I mean...

41:01.169 --> 41:02.488
...we all have a little bad in us.

41:02.689 --> 41:06.443
It's just that when you turn bad,
things tend to catch on fire.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.005
And this is supposed to be
making me feel better?

41:10.369 --> 41:12.644
What I mean is, is that
it's just as natural to be bad

41:12.809 --> 41:13.958
as it is to be good.

41:14.609 --> 41:15.803
That's how we know
what good is.

41:15.969 --> 41:19.086
That's how we're able
to make the choice to be good.

41:19.249 --> 41:22.764
Remember, Anton wouldn't
have needed evil past Phoebe

41:22.929 --> 41:25.204
if you hadn't evolved
into good Phoebe.

41:27.409 --> 41:29.969
Still, it's okay to be bad
every once in a while, isn't it?

41:30.649 --> 41:32.048
Oh, yeah.

41:32.209 --> 41:34.006
A lot.
