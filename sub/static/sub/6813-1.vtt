00:49.765 --> 00:51.790
Thanks for everything.

00:57.506 --> 00:59.599
Guess what I did
last night.

01:00.442 --> 01:01.568
Dude!

01:22.998 --> 01:24.795
Now let's rock
Westside Academy!

01:32.841 --> 01:34.433
<i>Taste the beast!</i>

01:35.177 --> 01:36.769
<i>You can do</i>
<i>anything you want in life</i>

01:36.878 --> 01:39.007
<i>as long as you stay</i>
<i>away from drugs.</i>

01:39.180 --> 01:40.775
<i>Why would a person</i>
<i>use illegal drugs?</i>

01:40.949 --> 01:42.678
<i>Many reasons.</i>

01:42.784 --> 01:45.218
<i>Maybe they're trying to fit in
with a new group of friends.</i>

01:45.320 --> 01:46.617
<i>Maybe they're curious.</i>

01:46.788 --> 01:48.119
<i>Maybe they're just bored.</i>

01:48.223 --> 01:49.190
<i>But whatever the reason,</i>

01:49.291 --> 01:51.418
<i>what should you say when
someone offers you drugs?</i>

01:51.827 --> 01:54.295
<i>Say, " No, thanks.</i>
<i>I'll have a Minotaur. "</i>

01:54.396 --> 01:56.023
Stay off drugs! Minotaur!

01:56.198 --> 01:57.825
<i>Thank you, Minotaur man.</i>

01:59.835 --> 02:01.894
Hey! Nice cow
outfit, homo.

02:02.003 --> 02:04.494
Where can I pick one of
those up, the gay zoo?

02:04.606 --> 02:06.039
Oh, no. It's not a...
It's not a cow.

02:06.141 --> 02:07.165
It's a minotaur.

02:07.275 --> 02:08.333
It's a creature of myth,

02:08.443 --> 02:10.377
and he got this one out
of your mom's closet.

02:10.479 --> 02:13.175
She let me keep it
after I fucked her.

02:14.983 --> 02:17.747
Drugs are bad.
Energy drinks, good.

02:17.853 --> 02:20.378
<i>So whenever you'd like to
taste one, help yourselves.</i>

02:20.489 --> 02:23.117
<i>And for every can sold,</i>
<i>Minotaur will make a donation</i>

02:23.225 --> 02:25.159
<i>to the Keep Kids</i>
<i>Off Drugs foundation.</i>

02:30.098 --> 02:32.225
God, this suit
smells like Tater Tots.

02:32.334 --> 02:34.666
Yeah, I know what you need.

02:34.769 --> 02:37.101
Kiss?
Are you kidding? No. God.

02:38.206 --> 02:39.195
I love Kiss.

02:39.374 --> 02:40.363
No one loves Kiss.

02:40.475 --> 02:41.999
Paul Stanley is
sick of Kiss.

02:42.110 --> 02:44.271
Whoa! Don't dis
the Starchild.

02:44.379 --> 02:45.676
Hey, don't get me
wrong, all right?

02:45.780 --> 02:49.443
I like to "rock 'n' roll all
night and part of every day!"

02:50.051 --> 02:52.679
Party every day. "Rock 'n' roll
all night and party every day!"

02:52.787 --> 02:55.415
I like to rock 'n' roll part
of every day. Party every day.

02:55.524 --> 02:56.889
I usually have errands.
Party.

02:56.992 --> 02:59.483
I can rock 'n' roll from, like,
1:00 to 3:00. You need to party.

03:00.829 --> 03:01.887
<i>Hey, guys.</i>
<i>How's it going?</i>

03:01.997 --> 03:04.056
<i>When someone offers you some
illegal drugs, what do you say?</i>

03:04.165 --> 03:06.793
<i>You say, " No, thanks.</i>
<i>I'll just have a Minotaur. "</i>

03:06.902 --> 03:08.426
<i>I've had so many</i>
<i>of these things.</i>

03:08.603 --> 03:10.161
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

03:10.272 --> 03:11.830
<i>I may wet my pants.</i>
<i>Where's the bathroom?</i>

03:16.111 --> 03:17.135
Holy shit.

03:17.245 --> 03:19.372
Dude, this is like
Shrek's piss.

03:21.416 --> 03:24.783
<i>So remember, stay off drugs,</i>
<i>drink Minotaur and above all...</i>

03:24.886 --> 03:26.148
Taste the beast!

03:33.061 --> 03:34.289
You know what's
great about this job?

03:34.396 --> 03:35.693
You mean,
besides nothing?

03:35.797 --> 03:36.957
We're making
the world a better place.

03:37.065 --> 03:38.157
How?

03:38.266 --> 03:41.292
You know, giving the kids an
energy boost to stay off drugs.

03:41.403 --> 03:44.463
We're selling them nuclear
horse piss for 6 bucks a can.

03:44.573 --> 03:46.336
What an accomplishment.
Feels good, doesn't it?

03:46.441 --> 03:48.705
easy to do hung-over.

03:48.810 --> 03:50.072
I could do
this job forever.

03:50.178 --> 03:52.612
If I had to do this job forever,
I'd put a bullet in my head.

03:52.714 --> 03:54.079
Game face, bro.

03:54.182 --> 03:55.240
Surprise!

03:56.484 --> 03:57.610
Yeah!

03:58.386 --> 04:00.047
Got you, man! Got you!

04:00.155 --> 04:01.179
Happy anniversary!
Did you know?

04:01.289 --> 04:02.278
No.

04:02.390 --> 04:03.857
All right.
That was good!

04:03.959 --> 04:05.085
Oh, my God.
You're here.

04:05.193 --> 04:06.251
Wheeler called me. Hi.

04:06.361 --> 04:07.385
Thank you for warning me.

04:07.495 --> 04:09.622
Hey, I tried to tell them
you don't like surprises,

04:09.731 --> 04:12.131
but they really wanted
to celebrate your milestone.

04:12.233 --> 04:13.757
<i>What's up, mino-tards?</i>

04:15.370 --> 04:16.462
What's up, Wheeler?

04:16.637 --> 04:17.730
<i>My dick!</i>

04:17.839 --> 04:19.067
"My dick!"

04:19.173 --> 04:21.642
<i>Everybody, we're here to
celebrate my best friend, Danny!</i>

04:21.743 --> 04:23.404
We just work together.
Not "best friend."

04:23.511 --> 04:24.637
Be nice.

04:24.746 --> 04:26.441
<i>Danny's been</i>
<i>working here 10 years!</i>

04:26.548 --> 04:28.072
<i>That's almost</i>
<i>a decade of living the dream.</i>

04:28.183 --> 04:29.241
You're the
man, Danny!

04:29.351 --> 04:30.784
<i>I want to grow</i>
<i>old with you, Danny.</i>

04:30.885 --> 04:32.147
<i>Hopefully,</i>
<i>we'll be tasting the beast</i>

04:32.253 --> 04:33.447
<i>for the rest of</i>
<i>our lives together!</i>

04:33.555 --> 04:35.079
Yeah!
- All right!

04:36.291 --> 04:40.057
<i>It's early morning</i>
<i>The sun come out</i>

04:40.195 --> 04:42.356
<i>Last night was shaking</i>
<i>And pretty loud</i>

04:42.464 --> 04:43.624
This is a nightmare.

04:43.732 --> 04:45.495
Come on. I took
the afternoon off.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.659
There's cake! Let's
try and enjoy ourselves.

04:47.769 --> 04:50.237
<i>Mitch from Graphics,</i>
<i>take over!</i>

04:50.338 --> 04:51.737
Do it!
- Let's go next!

04:51.840 --> 04:53.467
Come on. It'll be fun.
No.

04:53.575 --> 04:55.600
Why not? Come on.
We'll do a duet!

04:55.710 --> 04:57.268
Getting up in front
of a group of people

04:57.379 --> 04:59.176
and singing is not my
idea of fun. All right?

04:59.280 --> 05:00.907
It's humiliating.

05:01.016 --> 05:02.449
<i>With another sin</i>

05:02.550 --> 05:03.983
I'm gonna sing.

05:05.787 --> 05:07.414
<i>Here I am</i>

05:07.522 --> 05:08.546
<i>Ow!</i>

05:08.657 --> 05:11.524
<i>Rock you like a hurricane</i>

05:11.760 --> 05:13.591
Come on, come on, come
on, come on! Yeah, yeah!

05:13.695 --> 05:14.889
<i>Here I am</i>

05:14.996 --> 05:16.327
Come on. Sing it!

05:16.464 --> 05:19.024
<i>Rock you like a hurricane</i>

05:19.134 --> 05:20.328
Danny?

05:21.169 --> 05:22.261
What is your problem?

05:22.370 --> 05:23.359
Look, I'm sorry,
all right?

05:23.471 --> 05:26.372
I'm not Wheeler, happy
in some brainless job,

05:26.474 --> 05:27.532
no goals, no ambition.

05:27.642 --> 05:29.234
Hey, you don't know
how Wheeler feels.

05:29.344 --> 05:32.541
For all you know, he hates
his job as much as you do.

05:32.647 --> 05:34.581
I love this job!

05:34.683 --> 05:36.742
Hey, Wheeler!
She's tasting your beast!

05:40.221 --> 05:41.745
Good morning.
Can I take your order?

05:41.856 --> 05:43.187
Can I get a tall chai?

05:43.358 --> 05:44.723
And a large black coffee.

05:44.826 --> 05:45.724
A what?

05:45.894 --> 05:46.826
Large black coffee.

05:46.928 --> 05:47.952
Do you mean a <i>venti?</i>

05:48.063 --> 05:49.052
No, I mean a large.

05:49.164 --> 05:51.223
He means a <i>venti.</i>
Yeah, the biggest one you've got.

05:51.332 --> 05:52.492
<i>Venti</i> is large.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.726
No. <i>Venti</i> is 20.

05:53.835 --> 05:54.859
Danny.

05:54.969 --> 05:58.200
Yeah. "Large" is large.
In fact, "tall" is large.

05:58.306 --> 06:00.274
And <i>grande</i> is
Spanish for large.

06:00.375 --> 06:02.172
<i>Venti</i> is the only one
that doesn't mean large.

06:02.277 --> 06:03.801
It's also the only
one that's Italian.

06:03.912 --> 06:06.403
Congratulations!
You're stupid in three languages.

06:06.514 --> 06:08.914
Look, dick.
<i>Venti</i> is a large coffee.

06:09.017 --> 06:10.450
Really? Says who?
Fellini?

06:10.552 --> 06:11.917
How much is that?
Here's a 10.

06:12.020 --> 06:13.578
Do you accept lira,
or is it all euros now?

06:13.688 --> 06:15.519
You know what,
just keep the change.

06:15.623 --> 06:17.591
Jesus, Dan. You know what
they call the sizes here.

06:17.692 --> 06:19.216
You know what, you've been
picking fights with everybody.

06:19.327 --> 06:21.192
The girl at the party...
She said ASAP.

06:21.296 --> 06:22.991
ASAP, I'm sorry.
Huge crime.

06:23.098 --> 06:26.158
It's like "24/7" or "been there,
done that." You hate that, too.

06:26.267 --> 06:29.464
I don't hate it enough
to let it ruin my day.

06:29.571 --> 06:32.972
It's getting worse.
You know, man? The sun is shining,

06:33.074 --> 06:36.043
but you have lost the ability
to take any joy in life.

06:36.144 --> 06:37.736
I can't stand it anymore!

06:37.912 --> 06:39.504
You're just
a miserable dick now!

06:39.614 --> 06:40.842
You're mean to everybody!

06:40.949 --> 06:44.441
And, FYI, it's called a
<i>venti</i> because it's 20 ounces!

06:44.853 --> 06:46.445
20! <i>Venti!</i>

06:51.860 --> 06:53.293
Is that true?

06:55.530 --> 06:57.828
She says I take
no joy in life.

06:58.833 --> 07:00.357
I can see that.

07:00.969 --> 07:02.197
I gotta talk to her.

07:02.303 --> 07:03.600
Forget her, man.

07:03.705 --> 07:05.502
Let me give you a little
motto I live my life by,

07:05.607 --> 07:07.097
you got to hit
it and quit it.

07:07.208 --> 07:09.073
No ties, tangle free.

07:09.177 --> 07:10.405
Nobody tells me what to do.

07:10.512 --> 07:12.446
I go bang,
bang, bang the drum.

07:12.547 --> 07:13.980
What? That's not a motto.

07:14.082 --> 07:16.448
That's just you
saying a bunch of things.

07:16.551 --> 07:18.576
You know, Beth's right.
I'm a dick.

07:18.686 --> 07:21.211
Hey, I'm in a rut, just
going from school to school

07:21.322 --> 07:23.882
selling poison to
our nation's youth.

07:23.992 --> 07:26.051
It's not poison.
It's got juice in it.

07:26.161 --> 07:27.253
You know, I'm 35 years old.

07:27.362 --> 07:28.386
I got nothing to
show for my life.

07:28.496 --> 07:29.963
I figured I'd be something,

07:30.064 --> 07:32.464
something good,
a professor, engineer.

07:32.567 --> 07:34.000
I don't know.

07:34.102 --> 07:36.332
Figured I'd be
married. I'd...

07:40.508 --> 07:42.169
You know what? We're making a detour.
- What?

07:42.277 --> 07:43.369
We're making a detour.
Where?

07:43.478 --> 07:44.775
We're making a detour.
Why?

07:47.916 --> 07:50.111
Dude, you're too jacked up on
Minotaur. This is a mistake.

07:50.218 --> 07:51.742
It's fine. Look,
I'll be right back.

07:51.853 --> 07:54.117
Hey, we gotta be at the Blue
Valley Middle School by 1:30.

07:54.222 --> 07:55.450
Yep!

07:55.557 --> 07:57.252
No, I don't want
to plea-bargain.

07:57.358 --> 07:58.416
I didn't do it.

07:58.526 --> 08:01.188
Mr. Garvin, I just don't know what
other options we have, you know,

08:01.296 --> 08:04.697
because they have this clear
videotape of you stealing

08:04.799 --> 08:06.426
a lot of TVs.
<i>Guys! Go, go, go.</i>

08:06.534 --> 08:07.933
That could be any bald guy.

08:08.036 --> 08:11.267
<i>Look at me. Me, David Garvin,</i>
<i>stealing TVs.</i>

08:11.372 --> 08:12.805
<i>Who would believe it?</i>

08:12.907 --> 08:14.841
That is not me.

08:16.077 --> 08:17.738
Hey, hi.
I need to talk to you.

08:17.846 --> 08:20.371
Danny, I'm with a client,
so we'll talk later.

08:20.481 --> 08:22.278
I can go.
No, no. You stay.

08:22.383 --> 08:25.409
I'm not going anywhere
until you talk to me.

08:26.221 --> 08:27.552
Excuse me one...

08:27.655 --> 08:29.020
Thank you.
What? Fast.

08:29.123 --> 08:30.112
All right, you were right.

08:30.225 --> 08:31.192
I'm a dick. I'm a dick!

08:31.292 --> 08:32.816
You're dickish.
Yes, I'm dickish.

08:32.927 --> 08:34.554
I'm a dickish dick, and I'm
in a rut. We're in a rut.

08:34.662 --> 08:36.357
Let's shake things up.
I have an idea.

08:36.464 --> 08:37.794
Let's get married.
I don't have a ring.

08:37.899 --> 08:38.923
Are you serious?

08:39.033 --> 08:40.523
<i>Mazel tov!</i>
No.

08:40.635 --> 08:42.261
Never mind.
What?

08:42.370 --> 08:43.394
No.
Why?

08:43.504 --> 08:46.769
Because despite this very well
thought out and romantic proposal,

08:46.875 --> 08:49.105
I'm not that interested in
becoming Mrs. Dick-in-a-rut.

08:49.210 --> 08:50.609
Heard that.
Really?

08:50.712 --> 08:52.043
Did you hear that?
Danny?

08:52.146 --> 08:54.171
Maybe you heard that because
you're 2 feet away from us.

08:54.282 --> 08:55.772
That's another one I hate.
"Heard that!"

08:55.884 --> 08:57.545
You don't get married
to get out of a rut.

08:57.652 --> 08:58.812
You get married
because you love someone

08:58.920 --> 09:00.387
and you don't want to spend
your life without them.

09:00.488 --> 09:02.979
Who is this guy? Thank you, Mr. Garvin.
- He's a thief.

09:03.091 --> 09:04.285
Falsely accused.

09:04.392 --> 09:05.552
Oh, well.
He looks like Phil Collins.

09:05.660 --> 09:06.752
Yeah. I know.

09:06.861 --> 09:08.055
Look, life is hard,
all right?

09:08.162 --> 09:09.629
We've lived together for
seven years... You know what?

09:09.731 --> 09:12.825
Danny, life is hard, and you've
become the hardest part of my life.

09:12.934 --> 09:14.026
I should really go.

09:14.135 --> 09:15.466
No, you sit down.

09:17.705 --> 09:18.763
You know, Danny?

09:18.873 --> 09:19.862
We do need to
shake things up.

09:19.974 --> 09:21.134
I know!
That's what I'm saying!

09:21.242 --> 09:22.732
I'm moving out.

09:23.945 --> 09:26.413
Wait a minute.
Are you breaking up with me?

09:27.515 --> 09:29.005
Yeah.

09:29.117 --> 09:30.084
Really?

09:33.087 --> 09:34.281
Wow.

09:35.590 --> 09:37.057
Today sucks.

09:40.395 --> 09:43.455
Look, Danny, whenever a
door closes, another opens, okay?

09:43.564 --> 09:44.553
You just have
to look for it.

09:44.666 --> 09:45.860
And, seriously,
you're gonna get

09:45.967 --> 09:47.935
the most insane
sympathy-rebound pussy.

09:48.136 --> 09:50.502
And this is a good
month for that, too.

09:50.605 --> 09:51.833
I don't want that.

09:51.940 --> 09:53.771
Look, just keep
it together, bro.

09:53.875 --> 09:55.536
Okay? We got one
more school.

09:55.643 --> 09:57.611
We go out, we'll have a few
brewskis, we'll talk this over.

09:57.712 --> 09:59.976
Just put your
game face on.

10:02.817 --> 10:05.615
Taste the beast!
Stay off drugs!

10:05.720 --> 10:07.017
Minotaur!

10:09.490 --> 10:12.516
<i>Drugs. Why do</i>
<i>kids take drugs?</i>

10:13.127 --> 10:14.617
<i>'Cause they're awesome?</i>

10:16.230 --> 10:18.095
<i>No? Maybe they just
understand that life is pain,</i>

10:18.199 --> 10:21.396
<i>and if you smoke something or take
a pill, it'll go away for a while.</i>

10:21.502 --> 10:23.527
<i>I'll drink to that.</i>

10:23.638 --> 10:25.105
Dude, dude, dude,
dude. Come on.

10:25.273 --> 10:26.740
<i>No, no, no.</i>

10:26.841 --> 10:29.571
<i> People say,</i>
<i>"Embrace life. Enjoy life.</i>

10:30.778 --> 10:33.144
<i>" Just do it!</i>
<i>Live it! Rock it!"</i>

10:33.915 --> 10:36.349
<i>Fuck it,</i>
<i>because life is horrible.</i>

10:36.451 --> 10:39.784
<i>You know, I may not be so
happy-go-lucky, but I'm a realist.</i>

10:39.887 --> 10:41.718
<i>Get ready to have</i>
<i>your dreams dashed, kids,</i>

10:41.823 --> 10:42.949
<i>'cause nothing's</i>
<i>gonna work out</i>

10:43.057 --> 10:45.116
<i>the way you</i>
<i>think it's going to.</i>

10:46.227 --> 10:49.253
<i>Chin-chin. By the way,</i>
<i>this stuff's poison.</i>

10:53.134 --> 10:55.364
Game face, bro.
Game face.

10:55.470 --> 10:57.301
What part of "game face"
do you not understand?

10:57.405 --> 10:58.372
What the...

10:58.473 --> 10:59.405
Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

10:59.507 --> 11:00.838
Dude, I thought we
could park here.

11:00.942 --> 11:02.239
And you thought wrong,
you furry faggot.

11:02.343 --> 11:03.970
Please, just flip
the switch and put it down.

11:04.078 --> 11:05.670
It's too late.
It's already up.

11:05.780 --> 11:06.747
Come on, please.

11:06.848 --> 11:08.042
Put yourself in my shoes,
would you?

11:08.149 --> 11:09.639
Not my problem.

11:10.284 --> 11:11.945
Dude, please,
could you just be decent?

11:12.053 --> 11:13.315
I'm having a terrible day.

11:13.421 --> 11:17.380
Well, since you put it that
way, it's still not my problem.

11:19.060 --> 11:20.027
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:20.595 --> 11:21.926
Hey, man, can I ask
you a question?

11:22.030 --> 11:24.157
Get the fuck out
of the way, asshole!

11:24.265 --> 11:25.357
You want me to move?

11:25.466 --> 11:26.626
Game face, buddy.

11:29.070 --> 11:30.264
Danny?

11:32.106 --> 11:33.232
What's he doing?

11:33.341 --> 11:34.808
He's running.
We're running.

11:34.909 --> 11:36.240
We're running!

11:36.344 --> 11:37.606
No, no.

11:37.712 --> 11:40.806
Hey, what are you...
What are you... Get...

11:42.016 --> 11:43.881
I'm the guy that can't enjoy life?
Wrong!

11:43.985 --> 11:45.543
I'm gonna enjoy this!
Right!

11:45.653 --> 11:47.086
Wait, what?

11:50.324 --> 11:51.313
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:51.426 --> 11:53.121
Hey, man,
what you doing?

11:53.728 --> 11:54.717
Whoa, whoa! Danny!

11:54.862 --> 11:55.829
Hey, man!

11:56.330 --> 11:58.059
Holy shit, man!

12:02.336 --> 12:03.462
Dude!

12:09.710 --> 12:11.803
<i>Taste the beast!</i>

12:14.649 --> 12:15.946
Stay off drugs.

12:16.517 --> 12:17.848
You guys are fucked.

12:17.952 --> 12:19.442
I told you, you asshole!

12:20.388 --> 12:22.015
Beth?
Yes, Wheeler?

12:22.123 --> 12:26.059
I just want to start by saying
I think you're amazing, okay?

12:26.160 --> 12:28.651
You're, like, beauty
and brains incarnate.

12:28.763 --> 12:31.288
So, FYI, there
you go. Okay?

12:31.399 --> 12:35.893
Now, that's that, so as far as this
goes, I didn't do anything here,

12:36.003 --> 12:37.766
so if you wouldn't mind,
you can clear my name,

12:37.872 --> 12:38.896
and I can just walk
right out of here.

12:39.006 --> 12:42.464
Really? Because according to
this, you were a party to...

12:42.577 --> 12:44.442
A party to,
not the party.

12:44.545 --> 12:47.673
...reckless endangerment,
destruction of school property,

12:47.782 --> 12:50.410
obstructing a police officer,
attempted grand theft auto,

12:50.518 --> 12:52.713
disturbing the peace,
parking in a no-parking zone.

12:52.820 --> 12:53.878
Did I ever tell
you you're a dick?

12:53.988 --> 12:54.977
Yeah. Earlier.

12:55.089 --> 12:57.148
And, Danny, they suspended your license.
Did you know that?

12:57.258 --> 12:58.953
Yeah. I figured they
would probably do that.

12:59.060 --> 13:01.426
I mean, did you guys
think this was funny?

13:02.063 --> 13:03.894
You know, if you think about it,
this is kind of your fault.

13:03.998 --> 13:05.090
My... How is
this my fault?

13:05.199 --> 13:06.723
It's your fault because
you just threw it all away,

13:06.834 --> 13:08.233
and I came in here,
I proposed to you...

13:08.336 --> 13:09.803
Your proposal
was bullshit!

13:09.904 --> 13:11.166
But it was real.
It was from the heart!

13:11.272 --> 13:12.967
Shut up! Okay? Shut up!

13:13.574 --> 13:14.734
What's gonna happen?

13:14.842 --> 13:16.707
They wanted to
give you 30 days in jail.

13:16.811 --> 13:17.937
What?

13:18.045 --> 13:19.842
But I worked my
magic on the judge,

13:19.947 --> 13:21.471
and instead,
over the next 30 days,

13:21.582 --> 13:23.846
you have to log 150 hours
of community service.

13:23.951 --> 13:26.249
Community service?
What, we got to clean toilets?

13:26.354 --> 13:27.651
No, you're going
to Sturdy Wings.

13:27.755 --> 13:29.188
It's the judge's
favorite organization.

13:30.458 --> 13:31.550
Yes, Wheeler?

13:31.659 --> 13:33.524
What the fuck
is Sturdy Wings?

13:33.728 --> 13:36.386
<i>Sturdy Wings is</i>
<i>a simple concept.</i>

13:36.497 --> 13:39.227
<i>We bring adults and children
together in a structured format</i>

13:40.949 --> 13:42.075
<i>to enhance the lives</i>
<i>of these children</i>

13:42.184 --> 13:43.515
<i>through</i>
<i>one-on-one friendships.</i>

13:43.619 --> 13:45.678
People ask me,
"Gayle, how did you

13:45.787 --> 13:48.847
"come up with such
a life-altering program?"

13:48.957 --> 13:52.085
And I tell them I spent a
lot of time alone as a kid.

13:52.194 --> 13:54.719
My father was
a traveling salesman.

13:54.830 --> 13:57.560
My mother, out of
necessity, was a whore.

13:57.666 --> 14:00.464
<i>During adolescence,</i>
<i>I hungered for guidance</i>

14:00.569 --> 14:03.265
<i>from a committed,</i>
<i>caring adult.</i>

14:03.405 --> 14:06.533
<i>In my 20s and 30s, I suffered
through an endless cycle</i>

14:06.642 --> 14:10.806
<i>of failed relationships and
constant feelings of inadequacy.</i>

14:11.980 --> 14:15.507
<i>A mere 12 years ago,</i>
<i>I was a raging alcoholic.</i>

14:16.485 --> 14:19.921
<i>To make matters worse, I had
a massive drug addiction,</i>

14:20.022 --> 14:23.458
no money, no job,
no hope.

14:24.292 --> 14:27.193
<i>But at that moment,</i>
<i>I knew what I had to do.</i>

14:27.663 --> 14:29.460
Used to be
addicted to pills.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.431
Now I'm addicted
to helping.

14:32.968 --> 14:34.765
And when you're
addicted to helping,

14:34.936 --> 14:36.403
you don't need
an intervention.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.440
Because sometimes in life,
everybody needs...

14:40.542 --> 14:42.066
Sturdy Wings!
- Sturdy Wings!

14:42.811 --> 14:44.904
<i>A little lovin'</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

14:46.665 --> 14:50.123
<i>We need a little love</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

14:50.668 --> 14:53.193
<i>A little lovin'</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

14:54.539 --> 14:55.528
See, that's me?

15:01.479 --> 15:03.071
Okay, then.

15:03.181 --> 15:05.081
Welcome, everybody.

15:05.183 --> 15:09.643
You know, it's particularly exciting
for me to have a new batch of Bigs

15:09.754 --> 15:12.484
to match up with a new
group of kids, or Littles,

15:12.590 --> 15:14.490
as we call them
here at Sturdy Wings.

15:14.592 --> 15:16.059
I see a familiar face.

15:16.227 --> 15:17.558
Guilty as charged.

15:19.597 --> 15:20.928
I'd already prefer jail.

15:21.032 --> 15:23.398
All right. Let's move
right along here.

15:23.501 --> 15:25.025
Schedule-wise,
you can elect to spend

15:25.203 --> 15:26.727
as much time
with your Little...

15:26.838 --> 15:28.499
Hey.
- or as little time.

15:28.606 --> 15:29.630
It takes a village.

15:29.740 --> 15:30.729
Hmm?

15:30.842 --> 15:33.640
Hillary Clinton.
I'm sort of into politics.

15:33.744 --> 15:35.336
I'm sort of engaged.

15:35.446 --> 15:37.004
I sort of have a boner.

15:37.114 --> 15:38.775
Okay.

15:38.883 --> 15:41.181
Got lots of handouts,
information to cover,

15:41.285 --> 15:43.048
so let's get started.

15:43.154 --> 15:44.553
First time with
the program?

15:44.722 --> 15:46.121
Oh, God, really?

15:46.224 --> 15:47.714
Wheeler, switch with me.
No way, dude.

15:47.825 --> 15:50.885
Martin Gary.
I can always spot a newbie.

15:51.762 --> 15:53.093
It's my fifth
year with Wings.

15:53.197 --> 15:55.324
I guess Paul McCartney's
got nothing on me, huh?

15:55.533 --> 15:57.000
<i>Love, take me down</i>
<i>to the streets</i>

15:59.652 --> 16:00.710
That's not a Wings' song.

16:00.820 --> 16:02.549
Yeah, that's one of
their hits from the '70s.

16:02.655 --> 16:03.986
I'm not sure which one.
It's not a... It's not.

16:05.558 --> 16:06.616
It isn't?
- No.

16:06.726 --> 16:08.421
I think it might be.
- No, it's not. Nobody sings that song.

16:08.528 --> 16:09.859
I don't know about that.
I'll have to google it.

16:09.963 --> 16:13.626
That's right, some kids are
allergic to their own sweat.

16:13.733 --> 16:16.429
So probably best to put the
kibosh on physical activity.

16:16.536 --> 16:20.495
Maybe play a boardgame
or tell a knock, knock joke.

16:20.607 --> 16:21.596
Oh!

16:21.708 --> 16:22.675
Martin!

16:22.775 --> 16:24.470
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

16:24.577 --> 16:25.976
Mike Snifferpipits.

16:26.079 --> 16:27.637
Mike Snifferpipits who?

16:27.747 --> 16:30.545
Mike Snifferpipits who?
How many Mike Snifferpipits do you know?

16:30.650 --> 16:32.811
Come on! Let me in.
It's cold out here!

16:33.152 --> 16:34.517
Jeez.

16:35.421 --> 16:36.649
Martin, come on up here.

16:36.756 --> 16:37.780
Let's do
a little <i>dimostrazione.</i>

16:39.643 --> 16:40.132
This...

16:40.243 --> 16:41.210
Ah!

16:41.310 --> 16:43.540
Perfectly acceptable hug
between a Little and a Big.

16:43.646 --> 16:44.840
Ooh, la la!

16:46.215 --> 16:48.376
This is not.

16:48.484 --> 16:51.282
Well, obviously we're not
supposed to butt-fuck these kids.

16:51.387 --> 16:52.911
Well, it looks like
I'm out of handouts.

16:53.022 --> 16:55.081
So why don't we take a little
break, get a cup of joe?

16:55.191 --> 16:57.125
I know I'm gonna put
mine right in here.

16:57.226 --> 17:01.060
And then when you come back, it'll
be time to meet... Drum roll, please.

17:01.164 --> 17:03.860
...your Little!

17:12.942 --> 17:14.307
I cannot wait
to meet mine.

17:14.510 --> 17:16.102
I'm going to take
them to the zoo,

17:16.212 --> 17:19.079
because I
heard that the giant panda bear

17:19.182 --> 17:21.742
has a little
baby panda bear,

17:21.851 --> 17:23.250
and there's
just nothing cuter

17:23.419 --> 17:24.818
than a little
baby panda bear...

17:24.921 --> 17:25.979
Yeah, I can't do this.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.555
Danny, stop.

17:27.656 --> 17:30.319
We will get raped in jail.
Do you understand?

17:30.426 --> 17:31.916
What's the point?

17:32.195 --> 17:34.493
I mean, I've got
nothing to give a kid.

17:34.597 --> 17:36.258
If you were a kid, would
you want to hang out with me?

17:36.365 --> 17:37.559
Hey, do you want
to get raped?

17:37.667 --> 17:38.827
Hello, gentlemen.

17:38.935 --> 17:40.232
Hey.

17:40.336 --> 17:42.395
You probably heard that out of context.
- Excuse me?

17:42.505 --> 17:45.770
When I asked my friend Danny
if he wanted to get raped.

17:45.875 --> 17:49.311
I want you both to listen
to me, okay? And listen good.

17:50.313 --> 17:54.044
I know why you're here,
so don't BS a BSer.

17:54.150 --> 17:58.314
Okay? Your "presence"
here, court-ordered.

17:59.188 --> 18:01.179
Why did you put
"presence" in quotes?

18:01.290 --> 18:02.621
Are you implying
that we're not here?

18:02.725 --> 18:05.717
You know, one call
to the judge from me,

18:05.828 --> 18:08.262
and you are in the slammer,
like M.C. Hammer.

18:08.364 --> 18:09.592
Did M.C. Hammer
go to prison?

18:09.699 --> 18:11.064
Yes, he did.

18:11.167 --> 18:12.998
Or he came
extremely close.

18:13.102 --> 18:16.401
I'm certain he filed for bankruptcy,
so don't BS me right now, okay?

18:16.506 --> 18:18.167
I don't understand.
How are we BSing you?

18:18.274 --> 18:21.209
Exactly. I'm BS-proof.

18:21.310 --> 18:23.938
Here's a couple
of time sheets.

18:24.046 --> 18:27.379
You'll want your little buddies' parents
to sign them after each outing, okay?

18:27.483 --> 18:31.783
And that way, I can use my BS
flyswatter to swat away the flies

18:32.722 --> 18:34.485
that is your BS.

18:35.324 --> 18:37.189
Okay? Any questions?

18:37.860 --> 18:41.125
Hey, little Littles,
your Bigs are here!

18:47.270 --> 18:49.170
Okay. That's good fun!

18:50.306 --> 18:52.831
Danny, your Little is elsewhere.
Why don't you come with me?

18:52.942 --> 18:55.103
Oh, man.

18:55.711 --> 18:58.942
I've heard of popcorn in the
face, but this is ridiculous.

19:06.822 --> 19:08.983
Brothers in arms,
follow me!

19:11.360 --> 19:14.056
The evil King Argotron
has us cornered.

19:14.530 --> 19:17.966
My fair lady Esplen,
Goddess of Navalore.

19:18.067 --> 19:20.001
I fight for your honor.

19:21.037 --> 19:23.005
You wish to kiss me?

19:23.105 --> 19:25.505
There's precious
little time.

19:25.608 --> 19:27.269
What the hell.

19:33.916 --> 19:37.408
No! No. More later!
Now I must fight!

19:39.989 --> 19:44.221
Your kid's name is Augie Farks,
a little older than most of the kids.

19:49.465 --> 19:50.432
Oh.

19:52.268 --> 19:53.235
Um, that...

19:53.536 --> 19:54.833
I wasn't really 100% yet.

19:54.937 --> 19:56.905
Don't judge me
by that move that...

19:57.006 --> 19:58.166
I'm not gonna get
in trouble, right?

19:58.274 --> 20:01.505
This is just... This is just soft foam
and duct tape. It can't harm anyone.

20:01.611 --> 20:02.578
No worries, my liege.

20:02.678 --> 20:03.770
Okay!

20:03.879 --> 20:06.074
This is Danny.
He wants to be your new friend.

20:06.182 --> 20:07.672
So I'm gonna let you guys
get to know each other,

20:07.783 --> 20:09.910
and I'll fade into the mist.

20:12.488 --> 20:14.012
How's it going?

20:16.192 --> 20:18.092
That's a nice routine
you worked out.

20:18.194 --> 20:21.061
I hope you weren't
planning on slaying me.

20:25.468 --> 20:26.662
Wonderful.

20:26.769 --> 20:29.260
Come on, Wheeler. Let's meet
your kid. His name's Ronnie.

20:29.372 --> 20:31.897
He's one of our youngest.
Single mom, full-time job.

20:32.008 --> 20:35.034
Signed him up about six weeks ago.
Matched him up with eight different Bigs.

20:35.144 --> 20:36.372
No one's lasted
more than a day,

20:36.479 --> 20:39.573
but I think you're perfect
because you're young, you're fun,

20:39.682 --> 20:40.774
and you don't
wanna go to prison.

20:40.883 --> 20:42.350
That's scary!

20:42.752 --> 20:43.719
Oh!

20:44.353 --> 20:47.789
And FYI, you're playing on
this girl's court now, okay?

20:47.890 --> 20:49.653
So you're playing by her rules.
Are you the coach?

20:49.759 --> 20:51.818
I am the coach.
I'm the coach, and I'm the point guard,

20:51.927 --> 20:55.590
I'm the two forwards, the
center, and I'm the other guard.

20:55.698 --> 20:57.928
I'm the entire
organization.

21:01.470 --> 21:04.234
Hey, there, Ronnie. How you doing
today? Doing a little drawing?

21:04.340 --> 21:05.807
That's cool.

21:05.908 --> 21:07.637
I want you to meet
someone really special.

21:07.743 --> 21:11.076
And I think you two dudes
are gonna become real homeys.

21:11.180 --> 21:12.442
Ronnie, this is Anson.

21:12.548 --> 21:13.981
Wheeler's good.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.345
Whatever.

21:18.154 --> 21:20.418
Hey, big guy.
What you doing here?

21:20.523 --> 21:23.458
What up, Ronnie?
It's good to meet you.

21:28.864 --> 21:30.354
What you
drawing there?

21:30.466 --> 21:33.264
Oh. Beyoncé.
She's smoking!

21:33.369 --> 21:34.836
I don't want to
take my pants off!

21:34.937 --> 21:36.700
What? Whoa, whoa!

21:37.106 --> 21:38.869
All right, Ronnie.
That's enough.

21:38.974 --> 21:40.202
This bitch tried
to grab my joint!

21:40.309 --> 21:41.571
Language, Ronnie!

21:41.677 --> 21:43.201
My language is English!

21:43.312 --> 21:46.577
And this motherfucker tried
to grab on my hang-down.

21:46.682 --> 21:48.673
I got my own hang-down
to touch, kid.

21:48.784 --> 21:50.479
Honky-ass wanted
a handful of my balls!

21:50.586 --> 21:52.110
Honky? That's racist.

21:52.221 --> 21:55.088
Well, I trust you two will work
this out. I'm not gonna micromanage.

21:55.191 --> 21:57.216
Not my modus operandi.

21:59.395 --> 22:01.056
I have no idea what I'm
gonna do with this kid.

22:01.163 --> 22:04.792
Me, either. I bet if I suggested a game
of Quidditch, he'd come in his pants.

22:04.900 --> 22:07.130
I've been talking to him for half
an hour. Kid's barely said a word.

22:07.236 --> 22:08.965
Maybe we should just
go to jail. It's 30 days.

22:09.071 --> 22:10.060
Whoa!

22:10.172 --> 22:12.572
I don't know if this is some
kind of joke to you, Danny,

22:12.675 --> 22:14.666
but I actually
like my life, okay?

22:14.777 --> 22:17.371
Now, if I go to jail,
I'm gonna lose my job. Listen.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.607
We go to prison, you're
never gonna get Beth back.

22:19.715 --> 22:22.843
We come home after 30 days, she's
banging her boss. I guarantee it.

22:22.952 --> 22:25.512
Really? She's gonna be
banging Patricia Feingold?

22:25.621 --> 22:26.610
Her boss is a chick?

22:26.722 --> 22:27.950
Oh, Jesus.

22:28.057 --> 22:31.083
Danny, just listen, okay?
We're a team. All right? You and me.

22:31.193 --> 22:33.957
We can do this.
We just got to stick together.

22:34.063 --> 22:35.655
Fine.
Good.

22:35.765 --> 22:38.325
So, what do you
do with kids?

22:38.467 --> 22:43.427
<i>Hey, kids! We Chip Monks just broke our
vow of silence, and we want to sing!</i>

22:43.806 --> 22:46.468
<i>We are the monks</i>
<i>of chip monk Charlie's</i>

22:46.575 --> 22:48.839
<i>We will give you food to eat</i>

22:49.078 --> 22:51.444
<i>And once it's in our tummies</i>

22:51.547 --> 22:54.539
<i>We will move</i>
<i>our chip monk feet</i>

22:56.652 --> 22:58.916
<i>We are the butts</i>
<i>of Chip Monk ass</i>

22:59.021 --> 23:00.079
<i>But we've got the ass...</i>

23:00.189 --> 23:01.213
Come on! Sit down!

23:01.323 --> 23:03.689
All right?
Please. Danny.

23:03.793 --> 23:05.283
I like Ronnie's
version better.

23:05.394 --> 23:08.727
I like how it evokes
the concept of ass and butt.

23:09.698 --> 23:11.029
Okay. Thanks.

23:11.133 --> 23:12.998
Don't throw shit,
Ronnie. Come on.

23:13.102 --> 23:15.502
How many hours
do we have left?

23:16.472 --> 23:18.565
So, do you
like Coca-Cola?

23:18.674 --> 23:21.541
I like the idea of it
more than I actually like it.

23:22.178 --> 23:23.907
Ooh! They got
chicken fingers.

23:24.013 --> 23:26.243
I'm gonna run
a train on these chicken fingers.

23:26.348 --> 23:27.474
I'm just gonna be like...

23:29.351 --> 23:32.718
Let me guess. You're not really rolling
with the ladies in school, are you, Augie?

23:32.822 --> 23:37.122
Oh, no. I'm really good friends with
the school nurse. She's a divorcée.

23:37.226 --> 23:41.492
So, Aug, it's a pretty
interesting cape.

23:41.597 --> 23:43.531
Are you like a
superhero or something?

23:43.632 --> 23:45.224
Yeah, I wish.

23:45.334 --> 23:48.064
No, this is... This is part
of my battle attire for Laire.

23:48.170 --> 23:49.228
What the hell is Laire?

23:49.338 --> 23:51.772
It's this fantasy world
where anything is possible.

23:51.874 --> 23:53.808
One minute you could be
sparring with an elf,

23:53.909 --> 23:57.174
and the next you could be battling
against a troll who wants nothing more

23:57.279 --> 24:00.305
than just to steal your gold
and leave you penniless!

24:00.416 --> 24:01.508
Sounds gay.

24:01.617 --> 24:02.879
No, no.
There's girls there.

24:02.985 --> 24:03.952
Girls can be gay.

24:04.053 --> 24:06.487
If by gay you mean
the old English definition

24:06.589 --> 24:10.821
of "fun, enjoyable and carefree,"
then, yes, it's extremely gay.

24:10.926 --> 24:12.791
I think they meant
the other definition.

24:12.895 --> 24:15.989
I know, but to understand it, you
really have to see it for yourself.

24:16.098 --> 24:17.190
Okay.

24:18.934 --> 24:20.424
Hey, pick us up
in two hours.

24:20.536 --> 24:22.504
Fuck you, Miss Daisy!

24:28.277 --> 24:29.801
So, Augie, why do
they call it Laire?

24:29.912 --> 24:32.346
It's Live Action
Interactive Role-playing Explorers.

24:32.448 --> 24:33.676
We're all divided
into countries,

24:33.782 --> 24:36.273
fighting a never-ending war
to control the realm.

24:36.385 --> 24:39.946
Or until they have to
clear you out for soccer practice.

24:40.656 --> 24:41.623
Oh!

24:41.757 --> 24:43.588
Greetings, nobleman!

24:44.894 --> 24:48.227
Any friend of Blufgan's
is a friend of Kuzzik,

24:48.330 --> 24:51.595
fifth son of Leponius,
earl of Ringor.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.362
Diana has put
her bosom away.

24:54.470 --> 24:57.769
Apollo has lifted his skirt.
The day has been launched.

24:57.873 --> 25:01.673
May I present to you
my vassal, Artonius?

25:01.777 --> 25:02.744
Greetings, friends.

25:02.845 --> 25:03.971
Greetings.

25:04.079 --> 25:09.142
Tell me, Blufgan, art thou
preparing for the Battle Royale?

25:09.752 --> 25:11.117
'Tis a mere month away.

25:11.220 --> 25:12.414
Aye, my lord.

25:12.521 --> 25:13.954
Huzzah, huzzah!

25:14.056 --> 25:17.457
Godspeed, Blufgan,
and all hail Xanthia!

25:17.559 --> 25:19.083
Hail, Xanthia!
Hail, Xanthia!

25:19.762 --> 25:21.627
Rub-a-dub-dub!

25:24.667 --> 25:26.066
What the fuck just
happened there?

25:26.168 --> 25:27.328
They're my kinsmen.

25:27.436 --> 25:28.733
We're all from Xanthia.

25:28.837 --> 25:31.635
We're a smaller country,
but we're no Cacedonia, Danny.

25:31.740 --> 25:33.731
Ow! Don't hit so hard!
Okay.

25:35.077 --> 25:36.101
Hi, Blufgan.

25:36.211 --> 25:37.371
Hey! Hey, Esplen.

25:39.014 --> 25:40.982
Blufgan! Blufgan!
Blufgan!

25:41.083 --> 25:42.710
Blufgan!

25:44.887 --> 25:47.412
All right, Gleebo.
One more.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.260
I should have never started
feeding the goddamn elves.

25:53.362 --> 25:54.590
Jesus Christ.

25:54.697 --> 25:55.925
Hey, master handler.

26:00.002 --> 26:01.526
Whoa! Who's that dork?

26:01.637 --> 26:03.036
That's the king.

26:03.505 --> 26:07.271
Well, I should have guessed. Nothing
says royalty like The Burger Hole.

26:07.376 --> 26:09.867
Yeah, he and his lackeys
eat there before every battle.

26:09.979 --> 26:12.072
His majesty approaches.
Oh, crap!

26:12.181 --> 26:13.546
His royalty approaches!

26:13.649 --> 26:15.173
Long live the king.

26:15.551 --> 26:16.677
What are you doing?

26:16.785 --> 26:18.514
You have to kneel
before the king.

26:18.620 --> 26:22.056
Bow down, little girl.
Little girl, bow down, bow down.

26:22.157 --> 26:23.249
Why?

26:23.359 --> 26:24.826
Because he's the king.
I beg you!

26:29.798 --> 26:31.322
No.

26:31.433 --> 26:32.661
Damn it.

26:36.705 --> 26:39.503
Hey, pull over to the mini-mart
and get me some OJ,

26:39.608 --> 26:41.576
and not that
from-concentrate shit.

26:41.677 --> 26:42.974
Would it kill you
to say please?

26:43.078 --> 26:44.636
It might.

26:44.780 --> 26:48.409
"Concentrate. Not from
concentrate. Pulp. Low pulp.

26:48.517 --> 26:50.041
"Lots of pulp."

26:50.152 --> 26:51.346
Well, well, well.

26:51.453 --> 26:55.048
Hey. Fancy meeting you here.
What, are you stalking me?

26:56.291 --> 26:58.851
Had to get my bagel-dog fix.
So how's little Ronnie?

26:58.961 --> 27:02.021
Oh, you were right about us
being a great match. Yeah.

27:02.131 --> 27:05.328
You know, like at Christmas when you
get a gift? That's what Ronnie is.

27:05.434 --> 27:07.834
A gift. I love him so much.

27:08.137 --> 27:11.231
Wow. Well,
that's very nice.

27:11.974 --> 27:15.307
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gots to get my Slurpee on.

27:15.411 --> 27:17.709
Well, watch this though first.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.376
Look at that.
What does that look like?

27:23.685 --> 27:24.777
Okay.

27:31.560 --> 27:32.584
Open the door, Ronnie.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.753
You forgot to say "please."

27:35.731 --> 27:39.326
Please open the door,
or I'll pour your juice out.

27:39.902 --> 27:42.336
I don't drink
juice, biatch!

27:42.438 --> 27:44.269
Come on. Hey. Ronnie.

27:48.510 --> 27:51.536
Oh, no. Don't turn that
engine on. I swear to God...

27:54.416 --> 27:56.976
Okay. Okay.
Joke's over, buddy.

27:57.086 --> 27:58.713
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

27:58.821 --> 27:59.788
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:00.956 --> 28:04.221
Good one! Good one, Ronnie!
Now open the fucking door!

28:04.326 --> 28:06.191
Ronnie! What are you doing?

28:06.295 --> 28:07.626
Dude, dude, dude, dude,
dude, dude, dude, dude!

28:08.797 --> 28:10.264
What are you doing?

28:13.535 --> 28:15.196
Baby! Yeah!

28:17.272 --> 28:19.137
Don't you run me over!

28:19.241 --> 28:20.469
Oh, no!

28:22.044 --> 28:23.136
Ouch! Watch it!

28:24.346 --> 28:25.711
Hey!

28:25.814 --> 28:28.681
Oh, yeah. So good.
Good times.

28:32.921 --> 28:34.388
You're on
thin ice, buddy.

28:34.490 --> 28:35.684
Then quit.

28:35.791 --> 28:37.224
I never quit.

28:37.326 --> 28:39.294
Give me my
damn juice.

28:39.394 --> 28:41.521
Oh, this juice?
Yeah, that juice.

28:47.069 --> 28:48.263
Fucking asshole.

28:48.370 --> 28:49.701
Punk bitch.

28:49.805 --> 28:53.803
The lad had seasoned his mutton
with wine berry and not mead!

28:56.011 --> 29:00.175
Hey, did you see that spell of
unbreakable madness I casted on those orcs?

29:00.282 --> 29:02.045
I don't think so.

29:02.751 --> 29:04.878
The length of a moon,
hence "honeymoon."

29:06.688 --> 29:09.589
Eight hours down,
142 to go.

29:09.691 --> 29:11.420
This sucks ass.

29:11.527 --> 29:14.553
Dude, I just spent the
afternoon in Middle-earth

29:14.663 --> 29:17.097
with glee-glop and the
floopty-doos, all right?

29:17.199 --> 29:18.257
Give me a fucking break.

29:18.367 --> 29:19.698
I got fucking carjacked.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.200
Yeah? Well, I got dumped.

29:21.303 --> 29:22.736
You deserved it!

29:23.739 --> 29:25.263
I hate your face.

29:25.374 --> 29:27.535
I hate your face.

29:35.617 --> 29:37.209
Ronnie! Ronnie!
Take the wheel!

29:37.319 --> 29:38.411
Yeah.
- What are you doing?

29:38.520 --> 29:40.181
That is not safe!
He can't drive!

29:40.289 --> 29:41.313
This is unsafe.

29:41.423 --> 29:42.617
Okay, stop! Stop! Okay!

29:42.724 --> 29:45.318
What the fuck?
I'm driving! What...

29:47.663 --> 29:48.721
Oh, my God!

29:48.830 --> 29:50.092
Nice. Look what
you started.

29:50.199 --> 29:51.632
Happy now?
- I'm gonna kill you!

29:51.733 --> 29:53.360
What did I do?

30:01.777 --> 30:03.972
So I guess I'll pick you
up tomorrow around 9:00?

30:04.079 --> 30:05.603
Uh, could we make it 10:00?

30:05.714 --> 30:08.308
Kid, you wanna spend
some hours together or not?

30:08.417 --> 30:11.477
Dude, if I'm gonna have to chauffeur
your asses around, let's make it 10:00.

30:11.587 --> 30:12.611
Yeah.

30:12.721 --> 30:15.155
Hey, Danny, you wanna
come see my turtle?

30:15.257 --> 30:16.690
I'm fine.

30:21.763 --> 30:23.890
Of course he
has a turtle.

30:29.571 --> 30:30.970
See you tomorrow, Ronnie.

30:31.073 --> 30:32.438
Fuck you, Anson!

30:32.541 --> 30:33.565
Never gets old.

30:33.675 --> 30:34.903
Wait, wait, wait.

30:35.010 --> 30:36.341
You bitch!

30:50.525 --> 30:52.152
Oh, my God.
She's moving out.

30:52.261 --> 30:54.092
Dude, that's harsh.

30:56.231 --> 30:57.323
Shit.

30:58.567 --> 30:59.659
Wow, you weren't
kidding around.

30:59.768 --> 31:01.065
Yeah, I'm sorry.

31:01.169 --> 31:03.103
I wanted to be gone
by the time you got home.

31:03.205 --> 31:06.140
No, it's all right.
This is better, you know.

31:06.241 --> 31:09.438
Now we get to share the
moment with Wheeler and...

31:10.445 --> 31:11.810
Becca and Sarah.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.107
Yeah, and Becca
and Sarah.

31:13.215 --> 31:15.149
Who you've met,
like, 127 times.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.115
I know.
Keys.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.987
Beth, come on.
You don't have to do this.

31:21.657 --> 31:23.921
I left you the Crock-Pot.

31:24.026 --> 31:26.187
I know you like chili.

31:34.970 --> 31:39.998
I know it's really hard for you right
now, but I just want you to know that

31:40.108 --> 31:42.770
when you love something,
you set it free,

31:42.878 --> 31:45.870
and if it's meant
to be, you just...

31:47.416 --> 31:49.680
You take it back,
and it comes...

31:49.785 --> 31:51.616
Yeah, I know where
you're going with it.

31:51.720 --> 31:55.679
Yeah, and if she doesn't come back, I'd
go for that friend of hers in the sweater.

31:55.791 --> 31:59.852
I know she's a few pounds overweight,
but, you know, in my experience,

31:59.961 --> 32:03.089
it's the bigger ones that
do way more stuff.

32:03.198 --> 32:04.256
Good talk, Wheeler.

32:04.366 --> 32:05.993
Pick you up at 10:00.

32:16.645 --> 32:17.634
Hi, Ronnie.

32:17.746 --> 32:19.270
How are you today?
What are you doing here?

32:19.381 --> 32:20.678
I told you I'd pick
you up at 10:00, right?

32:20.782 --> 32:22.044
But I thought
you'd pussy out.

32:22.150 --> 32:26.519
Well, you see? It's wonderful. We're
learning so much about each other.

32:32.928 --> 32:34.987
Hey! You must be Wheeler.

32:35.097 --> 32:36.689
I'm Karen.
Hi, Karen.

32:36.798 --> 32:38.663
Wow, you look way too young
to be Ronnie's mother.

32:38.767 --> 32:40.166
What are you,
the babysitter?

32:40.268 --> 32:41.929
You're funny.

32:42.037 --> 32:44.562
You're gonna need that sense of humor
if you're gonna keep up with my son.

32:44.673 --> 32:47.403
It's about time Sturdy Wings
found someone who could.

32:47.509 --> 32:51.570
Yeah, well, I think that
Ronnie's a great little dude.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.342
"A great little dude"?
You're cute.

32:55.917 --> 32:57.077
You ready, pal?

32:57.185 --> 32:58.914
I ain't your pal, vanilla.

32:59.454 --> 33:01.479
Karen, would you mind
signing my hours sheet?

33:01.590 --> 33:03.148
Sure.
Great.

33:04.526 --> 33:05.686
Well.

33:06.762 --> 33:08.354
All right.
You boys have fun.

33:08.463 --> 33:10.954
His idea of fun is a
fucking pottery class, yo.

33:11.066 --> 33:14.627
Hey. Hey, hey.
Watch your mouth, little man.

33:16.571 --> 33:17.538
I love you.

33:17.639 --> 33:18.765
I love you, too.

33:24.279 --> 33:25.769
I got shotgun!

33:28.283 --> 33:30.342
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

33:30.452 --> 33:32.420
Stop. Who are you?
What do you want?

33:32.521 --> 33:35.547
I'm Danny from Sturdy Wings.
I'm here for Augie.

33:35.657 --> 33:38.854
Oh. I'm sorry. Augie, right.
He'll be out in a minute.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.359
Let me ask you something,

33:40.462 --> 33:43.090
because you're one of these guys
that's good with kids, right?

33:43.198 --> 33:45.063
Yeah. Totally.

33:45.167 --> 33:46.828
'Cause, the kid, man,
I don't get it.

33:46.935 --> 33:48.926
He's into dragons
and fairies

33:49.037 --> 33:50.470
and, you know, hoboes.

33:50.572 --> 33:51.630
Right.

33:51.740 --> 33:53.674
So, I mean, what am I
supposed to say to him?

33:53.775 --> 33:54.799
Yeah. I don't know. I don't...

33:54.910 --> 33:57.777
Hey, but while I've got you
here in my personal space,

33:57.879 --> 34:00.541
I was wondering if you could maybe
sign off on my hours from yesterday.

34:00.649 --> 34:02.617
Oh, no, I don't...
I'm not the kid's parent.

34:02.717 --> 34:05.777
No, that's... Parental signatures
are mama's department. One second.

34:05.887 --> 34:09.288
Lynette! Augie's little buddy's here.
He needs your signature.

34:09.391 --> 34:11.916
Oh! Hi!
Hi.

34:12.027 --> 34:13.619
I'm Lynette.
I'm Danny.

34:13.728 --> 34:15.059
So good to meet you.
You, too.

34:15.163 --> 34:18.291
I was wondering if you could maybe
sign my hours sheet from yesterday.

34:18.400 --> 34:19.492
Sure!

34:20.068 --> 34:24.937
You know, we are so thrilled that you are
gonna be spending some time with Augie,

34:25.407 --> 34:29.138
because, you know,
just how he is.

34:30.445 --> 34:31.434
How is he?

34:31.545 --> 34:35.572
I'm just glad you're gonna be getting
him out of his own little world a bit.

34:35.684 --> 34:38.551
It's like, "Get out of here!
Leave home!"

34:39.321 --> 34:41.380
Hey, why don't you come over
for dinner on Saturday night,

34:41.489 --> 34:43.219
and we can get to know you
a little bit better?

34:43.324 --> 34:47.284
I don't think so. It's not you.
I hate having dinner with people.

34:47.395 --> 34:48.487
Hey, Augie, ready to...

34:48.597 --> 34:49.585
Yeah, let's go.
Yeah.

34:56.371 --> 34:57.531
I think
they're over here.

34:57.639 --> 34:59.607
I'm disappointed.
This isn't gonna hurt anybody.

35:01.910 --> 35:03.969
So, your parents... Wow.

35:04.212 --> 35:05.839
Jim is not my dad.

35:06.448 --> 35:09.474
Okay. Well, that's
probably good.

35:10.685 --> 35:13.711
Hey, hey, Odeon.
Make way for King Argotron!

35:17.192 --> 35:18.318
Dude.

35:21.496 --> 35:23.726
Bow as your daughter does.

35:25.066 --> 35:26.397
Xanthians.

35:27.002 --> 35:28.367
Why bother?

35:29.271 --> 35:30.795
Good one, sir.

35:34.009 --> 35:35.601
Man, why do you
bow for that guy?

35:35.710 --> 35:38.144
Because he's the king, and
he rules the entire realm.

35:38.246 --> 35:39.975
He rules the entire realm?
Yeah.

35:40.081 --> 35:44.381
My bad. Is that when he is or isn't
whacking it to <i>The Sims?</i>

35:45.487 --> 35:48.012
You know, Augie, maybe you should
think about losing the cape.

35:48.123 --> 35:49.784
At least in public.

35:49.891 --> 35:52.451
People tend to avoid
people in capes.

35:52.561 --> 35:54.859
I know that's not
the case here.

35:55.564 --> 35:57.429
Look at these people.

36:03.038 --> 36:04.562
I like these people.
No, I know.

36:04.673 --> 36:08.165
But, you know, this isn't reality.
It's not the real world.

36:08.276 --> 36:11.677
I know that, but in this
world, I don't have to be me.

36:12.881 --> 36:14.872
I'm stuck again!

36:14.983 --> 36:17.349
Well, looks like maybe one of
your people could use a hand.

36:17.452 --> 36:20.319
Help! Help! Help!
Her, I don't like.

36:29.230 --> 36:31.130
Okay. This is my place.

36:31.700 --> 36:33.099
Shit hole.

36:34.369 --> 36:38.066
Look, kid, you're obviously not
a big fan of me, and that's okay,

36:38.173 --> 36:39.868
but I think there's
something to be gained

36:39.975 --> 36:43.069
from us spending 139
more hours together.

36:43.912 --> 36:45.072
Yeah.

36:46.815 --> 36:48.908
You know, my dad left me
when I was young,

36:49.017 --> 36:51.008
so I know it sucks,

36:51.119 --> 36:54.350
but what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

36:54.456 --> 36:57.152
Says the punk living
in the shit hole.

36:58.727 --> 36:59.853
Who are these clowns?

36:59.961 --> 37:00.950
Kiss?

37:01.062 --> 37:02.359
You don't know who Kiss is?

37:02.464 --> 37:03.954
No. Never heard of them.

37:04.065 --> 37:05.259
They look like
idiots to me.

37:05.367 --> 37:06.356
No, no, no, dude.

37:06.468 --> 37:08.493
These are four of the
smartest guys who ever lived.

37:08.603 --> 37:10.833
They're these Jewish guys
that grew up in New York,

37:10.939 --> 37:13.032
and they put on guitars
and makeup to get girls,

37:13.141 --> 37:14.836
and all of their songs
are about fucking!

37:14.943 --> 37:16.570
I'm listening.

37:20.682 --> 37:25.016
Seriously, this song is called <i>Love
Gun,</i> and it's about Paul Stanley's dick

37:25.120 --> 37:27.680
and how this girl's gonna
get some of his dick!

37:27.789 --> 37:29.120
Cool.

37:29.224 --> 37:30.555
I didn't know Jews
could sing like that.

37:30.659 --> 37:34.789
No. No. They couldn't at the time.
That's why they had to dress like clowns.

37:34.896 --> 37:36.158
This got them girls?

37:36.264 --> 37:39.700
Get this! They've been getting
pussy nonstop for 30 years!

37:39.801 --> 37:41.962
They're probably fucking right
now, and they're old dudes!

37:42.070 --> 37:43.799
They put makeup on,
and it's all good!

37:43.905 --> 37:45.031
No shit?

37:45.140 --> 37:48.871
<i>You pull the trigger of my</i>

37:50.011 --> 37:51.239
<i>Love gun</i>

37:51.346 --> 37:53.576
You see, Ronnie?
His dick is the gun!

37:56.551 --> 37:58.451
<i>Love gun</i>

37:59.454 --> 38:01.514
<i>Love gun</i>

38:02.957 --> 38:05.391
Okay, we logged 14
hours this weekend.

38:05.493 --> 38:06.892
That's not gonna
be enough.

38:06.995 --> 38:10.089
Somehow we gotta get them
on the weekdays, too.

38:10.198 --> 38:13.224
Hey, we could pretend to be their
uncles, pull them out of school.

38:13.334 --> 38:14.767
That just sounds
kind of creepy.

38:14.869 --> 38:16.063
Yeah, I guess.

38:16.171 --> 38:18.833
Hey! Sexy like a
chocolate strawberry.

38:21.810 --> 38:22.777
What's her problem?

38:22.877 --> 38:23.969
I don't know.

38:24.079 --> 38:25.842
I mean, you laid that
genius line on her.

38:25.947 --> 38:27.346
I can't believe she
didn't take your bait.

38:27.449 --> 38:28.643
I know, right?

38:29.451 --> 38:30.975
Well, well, well.

38:31.086 --> 38:33.680
If it isn't Mr. Bullshit
and Dr. I'm-full-of-shit.

38:33.788 --> 38:34.914
In what way
are we full of shit?

38:35.023 --> 38:36.490
Which one of us
has the Ph. D?

38:36.591 --> 38:38.684
So how was your first
weekend with the boys?

38:38.793 --> 38:42.490
It was great. We did 14 hours.
Will you sign our sheets?

38:42.597 --> 38:45.225
Maybe give us a few more, just
for kicks? Round it up to 50?

38:45.333 --> 38:47.028
Don't you sass me.

38:47.135 --> 38:50.571
What, do you think I'm a pushover? You
know what I used to eat for breakfast?

38:50.672 --> 38:51.900
Cocaine.

38:52.440 --> 38:55.068
You know what I
used to eat for lunch?

38:55.643 --> 38:56.735
Cocaine.

38:56.845 --> 38:58.369
What'd you have for dinner?
Was it cocaine?

38:58.480 --> 39:03.417
I will sign your sheets, but you need to
know I am not here to service your hours.

39:03.518 --> 39:06.180
I'm here to service
these young boys.

39:06.287 --> 39:09.882
Do you think I give a shit
if you guys go to prison?

39:09.991 --> 39:11.959
I've been to prison. I have.

39:12.060 --> 39:13.891
I've been to prison.

39:14.295 --> 39:19.096
A prison of drugs, alcohol
and sick thoughts.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.561
I used to have sick thoughts.

39:21.669 --> 39:23.830
So don't you come in here,

39:23.938 --> 39:26.702
preaching to me about hours

39:27.475 --> 39:31.935
when you're standing over there,
and you're standing over there,

39:32.046 --> 39:34.014
and I don't know
which way is up!

39:34.115 --> 39:35.446
Um...
Should we come back?

39:35.550 --> 39:36.744
We can come back.
Yeah.

39:36.851 --> 39:38.284
Come here.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.855
We're having an overnight camping trip,
Big Bear this weekend.

39:41.956 --> 39:44.891
I suggest that you ask
your Littles to go with you.

39:44.993 --> 39:47.860
Maybe worry a little bit about them
and not so much about your hours.

39:47.962 --> 39:49.862
Overnight?
That's great. Sign us up.

39:49.964 --> 39:51.522
And, fellas,
will you do me a favor?

39:51.633 --> 39:54.033
Next time you
want to bullshit me,

39:54.636 --> 39:57.230
bullshit each
other instead, okay?

39:58.473 --> 40:00.304
See how that feels.

40:01.042 --> 40:02.737
Okay.
Yep.

40:02.844 --> 40:04.436
Okay. Okay.
Okay.

40:05.146 --> 40:06.477
All right.

40:07.582 --> 40:08.674
I hate camping.

40:08.783 --> 40:10.182
You could use a little
dose of the outdoors.

40:10.285 --> 40:13.584
Camping blows. It's dirty, and
I don't like sleeping on rocks.

40:13.688 --> 40:15.622
Bring some Ambien.
You'll sleep like a baby.

40:15.723 --> 40:19.557
There's always a guy with an acoustic guitar
that doesn't quite know how to play it.

40:20.428 --> 40:21.986
<i>Kumbaya, my...</i>

40:22.096 --> 40:23.085
Wait. I know it.

40:23.198 --> 40:24.165
<i>Kumbaya</i>

40:24.299 --> 40:26.631
You know.
Wait. I know it. Wait.

40:26.868 --> 40:29.496
<i>Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

40:31.306 --> 40:33.968
No. Wait.
Oh, yeah, I got it.

40:34.075 --> 40:35.099
This is it.

40:36.144 --> 40:38.169
I think that's got it.

40:39.914 --> 40:41.245
God damn it, Ronnie!

40:41.349 --> 40:43.010
What? 'Cause I'm black,
you think I did it?

40:43.117 --> 40:46.211
No, 'cause you did it
is why I think you did it.

40:47.522 --> 40:49.990
Let me tell you something.
I am not your Big, and I'll hit you.

40:50.091 --> 40:51.058
I will hit a child.

40:51.159 --> 40:53.252
I've never done that before,
but I will punch you in the face.

40:53.361 --> 40:54.623
Let's dance,
Ben Affleck!

40:54.729 --> 40:56.196
Ronnie! Leave him alone.

40:56.297 --> 40:57.286
Fine!

40:57.398 --> 40:59.263
But I'm watching
you, Daredevil.

40:59.367 --> 41:02.302
Looks like you guys
could use a hand up here.

41:04.038 --> 41:05.699
Come on, man!
Just having some fun.

41:05.807 --> 41:07.206
Let's take a hike.
- Thank you.

41:07.308 --> 41:11.176
Don't worry. Once the little ones are
asleep, I'll break out the PG stuff.

41:11.279 --> 41:12.746
<i>Kumbaya,</i> huh?

41:12.847 --> 41:14.075
You don't happen to
know any Wings, do you?

41:14.182 --> 41:15.479
Wings? Yeah.

41:15.884 --> 41:17.852
<i>Love, take me down</i>
<i>to the streets</i>

41:17.952 --> 41:19.317
Yeah!

41:20.088 --> 41:23.148
Man! She got some
boobies on her!

41:23.258 --> 41:24.782
You sure do like
boobies, Ronnie.

41:24.893 --> 41:25.917
I sure do.

41:26.027 --> 41:28.723
Sometimes I call myself
the Booby Watcher.

41:28.830 --> 41:32.163
Even got my own comic book.
<i>Adventures of the Booby Watcher.</i>

41:32.267 --> 41:34.827
Okay. You know,
I got a theory about boobies.

41:34.936 --> 41:36.267
Really?
Yeah.

41:36.371 --> 41:38.339
You see, there are as many women
as there are men on this planet.

41:38.439 --> 41:39.463
True that, true that.

41:39.574 --> 41:43.101
And every woman has two
boobs, for the most part.

41:43.778 --> 41:46.474
So therefore, there's twice
as many boobs as there are men.

41:46.581 --> 41:48.515
We're outnumbered,
and it's overwhelming.

41:48.616 --> 41:50.948
We're powerless.
We have to accept it.

41:51.052 --> 41:53.577
I like your take
on boobies.

41:54.255 --> 41:56.018
And I like boobies.

41:56.124 --> 41:57.648
Kid, you got a lot to learn.

41:57.759 --> 41:58.851
I know what I'm doing.
Really?

41:58.960 --> 42:00.484
So you're aware that you've
committed one of the most

42:00.595 --> 42:01.562
common rookie
boob-watching errors?

42:03.111 --> 42:04.203
What you mean?

42:04.312 --> 42:05.336
Never stare at
the boobies, kid.

42:05.447 --> 42:08.075
Yeah, once you get caught,
the game's over.

42:08.350 --> 42:10.113
But how?
It's called training.

42:10.218 --> 42:12.743
You know, being aware
without drawing attention.

42:12.854 --> 42:15.550
You don't think I've noticed the
34-C's in the camouflage tank top

42:15.657 --> 42:17.352
setting up the tent
directly to the left of us?

42:17.459 --> 42:20.860
How about those twin cannons hiking up
the mountain ridge 50 yards due west?

42:20.962 --> 42:22.190
Or the ridge itself?

42:22.297 --> 42:23.628
Round mounds of
grass shaped like...

42:24.466 --> 42:25.433
Boobies!

42:25.534 --> 42:26.523
Don't look over there.
Look here.

42:27.302 --> 42:29.827
Yeah, focus.
You'll get it.

42:30.172 --> 42:33.198
Too bad old Sweeny herself
couldn't come up here for this trip.

42:33.308 --> 42:34.366
That would have
been fun, huh?

42:34.476 --> 42:35.568
Yeah. A real blast.

42:35.677 --> 42:38.271
Yeah, she probably just
had to hold down the fort.

42:39.481 --> 42:41.278
You got a thing
for Sweeny, Martin?

42:41.616 --> 42:45.575
Sweeney? Me? No.
Now that is a knee slapper.

42:46.021 --> 42:47.283
Your erection is showing.

42:47.489 --> 42:48.456
What?

42:50.992 --> 42:51.959
You okay?

42:55.363 --> 42:57.263
Nature.

42:57.566 --> 43:01.093
Did you know that bald eagles are known
to engage in a bizarre mating ritual

43:01.203 --> 43:03.831
where two eagles fly upwards,
lock talons,

43:04.472 --> 43:07.100
then fall towards the earth
while rotating,

43:07.209 --> 43:09.268
separating moments before
they crash into the ground,

43:09.544 --> 43:12.342
if, and only if, they
consummate their bird fuck?

43:13.048 --> 43:16.848
If they don't, they're willing
to accept death by hard ground.

43:17.586 --> 43:19.451
It's the ultimate race
against the clock.

43:19.554 --> 43:20.885
Why are you
telling me this?

43:20.989 --> 43:22.547
Why would I not?

43:31.548 --> 43:33.243
Hi, Danny.

43:33.350 --> 43:35.341
I forgot to tell you,
they'll be telling

43:36.553 --> 43:37.611
ghost stories later.

43:37.721 --> 43:38.745
You should stop by.

43:40.290 --> 43:44.420
And as the barn door
creaked open, ever so slowly,

43:44.528 --> 43:47.497
standing there with
the moon at his back

43:47.597 --> 43:52.364
and holding the severed head of the
pediatrician's mother in his hand,

43:52.469 --> 43:55.267
was Philip,

43:56.907 --> 43:57.896
the pizza delivery boy

43:58.008 --> 44:00.374
from when they ordered pizza
at the beginning of the story!

44:00.477 --> 44:02.342
Come on, you guys!

44:02.446 --> 44:03.777
All right. Whatever!
Hey, come here.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.347
You guys
are unscareable.

44:05.449 --> 44:07.576
Think you can do better?
Who's got a better story? Come on.

44:07.684 --> 44:09.948
You guys are so smart.
Who's got a scarier story than me?

44:10.053 --> 44:11.953
Yes?
So what's up?

44:12.055 --> 44:14.250
I don't know.
What's up with you?

44:14.358 --> 44:15.882
I know you're engaged.
I haven't forgotten.

44:15.992 --> 44:16.959
Uh-huh.

44:17.094 --> 44:18.254
So what's this?

44:18.362 --> 44:19.329
Ooh.

44:19.596 --> 44:20.722
Those are my testicles.

44:20.831 --> 44:21.957
Yeah.

44:22.065 --> 44:24.124
Listen, I have an
arrangement with my fiancé.

44:24.234 --> 44:28.694
I'm completely faithful to him within
the area codes of greater Los Angeles.

44:28.805 --> 44:32.764
Out here, I'm just another
woman who's ready to cheat.

44:32.876 --> 44:34.639
Give me two minutes.

44:34.745 --> 44:37.509
How about you, Daniel?
You think you can top it?

44:37.647 --> 44:39.205
It's Danny.
Oh.

44:39.316 --> 44:44.549
<i>Oh, Danny boy</i>
<i>The Danny boys are Danny boys</i>

44:45.555 --> 44:48.922
Come on, man! We're on pins
and needles. Give us a story.

44:49.025 --> 44:51.118
Okay, I've got a really
good horror story,

44:51.228 --> 44:54.391
and it's particularly
terrifying because it's true.

44:54.498 --> 44:56.432
Oh, a true story!

44:56.533 --> 45:00.401
In countries all over the
world, including our own,

45:00.537 --> 45:03.199
children, many
of them just like you,

45:04.007 --> 45:06.498
are abducted and sold

45:06.610 --> 45:09.374
into the world of
underground sex trafficking.

45:09.679 --> 45:10.737
What is he saying?
Okay!

45:12.082 --> 45:14.448
I'm gonna stop you there,
Danny boy. That is a scary story.

45:14.551 --> 45:17.486
Story time is over! Everybody,
let's break into our groups.

45:17.587 --> 45:21.216
Group A, come with me for
Martin's midnight mystery hike.

45:21.324 --> 45:23.485
And group B, go with Duane.
What you got on tap, Duane?

45:23.593 --> 45:26.289
We are gonna make some
s'mores using white chocolate.

45:26.396 --> 45:27.385
Oh.

45:27.497 --> 45:30.660
Well, I'm not sure I agree with
that, but to each their own.

45:30.767 --> 45:32.860
Hey, hey, Danny.
Is this all your Ambien?

45:32.969 --> 45:33.958
Yeah.

45:34.070 --> 45:36.197
Okay, 'cause Connie
and I are gonna take some,

45:36.306 --> 45:38.035
and then we're gonna stay up
as late as we can,

45:38.141 --> 45:39.802
because if you fight
the urge to go to sleep,

45:39.910 --> 45:42.174
things start to get all trippy,
and then we're gonna fuck.

45:42.279 --> 45:43.337
Connie who's engaged.

45:43.447 --> 45:44.539
Oh, yeah.

45:44.648 --> 45:48.482
You know what? Don't worry about
it. We'll make do with three each.

45:56.226 --> 45:58.786
Fight it. Come on.
Stay awake.

45:59.563 --> 46:02.430
You know, a lot of people don't
realize that bushes, just like flowers,

46:02.532 --> 46:04.762
emit a wonderful aroma,
especially at night.

46:04.868 --> 46:06.460
Who wants to sniff
this bush?

46:13.577 --> 46:16.045
So Ronnie's out on
some kind of hike.

46:16.146 --> 46:17.204
Where's Wheeler?

46:17.314 --> 46:18.542
He's having sex
with a married lady.

46:18.648 --> 46:19.637
Oh.

46:19.749 --> 46:21.580
Are you sewing?
Yeah.

46:22.052 --> 46:24.282
This is my country's
emblem.

46:26.389 --> 46:29.586
Do you think we can speak
in private for a second?

46:31.428 --> 46:32.793
Yeah. Yeah.

46:34.397 --> 46:36.695
I already talked to Kuzzik
and Artonius,

46:36.800 --> 46:41.828
and we would like to officially invite
you to be a soldier in the Xanthian army.

46:41.938 --> 46:45.499
Well, that's very kind of you, but
I would like to respectfully decline.

46:45.609 --> 46:46.701
I'm kind of a pacifist.

46:46.810 --> 46:48.801
I don't really believe
in imaginary bloodshed.

46:48.912 --> 46:51.938
But there's room in Laire
for all belief systems.

46:52.048 --> 46:55.677
Even early barbaric
modalities have their place.

46:56.953 --> 46:59.319
Augie, look, you're
a good kid. I like you,

46:59.422 --> 47:01.890
but I'm not really into
the whole buddy-buddy,

47:01.992 --> 47:04.290
let's-go-do-stuff-together
kind of thing.

47:04.394 --> 47:06.624
Well, why are you here?

47:09.399 --> 47:11.162
It's court-ordered.

47:11.801 --> 47:13.701
What did you do?

47:14.471 --> 47:17.338
I just had one of those days
where you wake up and say,

47:17.440 --> 47:20.432
"Where did the last
10 years of my life go?"

47:20.544 --> 47:23.741
I asked my girlfriend
to marry me out of impulse.

47:24.414 --> 47:25.904
She dumped me.

47:26.750 --> 47:31.084
And then I ran a truck that looks
like a bull into a statue of a horse.

47:31.788 --> 47:33.551
I'm not here by choice
either, by the way.

47:33.657 --> 47:34.715
No?

47:34.824 --> 47:36.519
My guidance counselor
signed me up.

47:36.626 --> 47:38.287
Really?
Yeah.

47:38.395 --> 47:41.922
Said anyone who wears a cape and
has a sword should have more friends.

47:42.032 --> 47:43.795
Whoop-dee-doo, right?

47:44.601 --> 47:46.262
So both of us don't
want to be here.

47:46.369 --> 47:47.631
No.

47:47.737 --> 47:49.864
Well, we got that in common.

47:51.441 --> 47:52.806
So do you have
a girlfriend?

47:52.909 --> 47:54.035
No. What?

47:54.244 --> 47:57.372
Why would you ask...
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

47:57.480 --> 48:00.415
But what about that girl you're always
looking at, with the cap and the...

48:00.517 --> 48:02.417
I don't know what
you're talking about.

48:02.519 --> 48:04.885
Come on!
Don't bullshit me.

48:04.988 --> 48:06.751
You're always
looking at her.

48:06.856 --> 48:09.347
You mean Esplen,
the Goddess of Navalore?

48:09.459 --> 48:10.483
I don't know. Probably.

48:10.594 --> 48:11.618
Her name's Sarah.

48:11.728 --> 48:12.820
Sarah.

48:13.229 --> 48:14.787
Ah, Sarah.

48:16.166 --> 48:17.224
You ever talk to her?

48:17.334 --> 48:18.392
No.

48:18.501 --> 48:21.163
I've killed her a couple of times in
battle, but that's not really anything.

48:21.271 --> 48:22.203
Talk to her.

48:22.305 --> 48:23.567
No, I can't talk to her.

48:23.673 --> 48:26.506
Romance her. Give her that
patch of yours. She'll love it.

48:26.610 --> 48:27.634
No, I can't give her this.

48:27.744 --> 48:28.938
She'll be flattered!
Why not?

48:29.045 --> 48:30.774
I made it for you.

48:33.183 --> 48:34.150
You made that for me?

48:34.250 --> 48:35.308
Yeah.

48:36.152 --> 48:37.244
Great. Now I gotta do it.

48:37.354 --> 48:38.753
Yeah, that kind
of was my plan.

48:38.855 --> 48:40.379
That was so low, dude.

48:45.362 --> 48:47.887
No. Come on, Connie.
Stay awake.

48:51.234 --> 48:52.326
Fuck.

48:53.903 --> 48:55.268
I gotta pee.

48:56.106 --> 48:57.232
Yep.

48:59.843 --> 49:01.470
Hey! Martin!

49:01.578 --> 49:02.567
Okay.

49:02.679 --> 49:04.704
What are you
doing out here?

49:04.814 --> 49:06.338
I'm just doing my
perimeter check.

49:06.449 --> 49:09.850
Hey, did you know that
dinosaurs are not extinct?

49:09.953 --> 49:13.480
Because birds are dinosaurs,
and they're everywhere.

49:13.690 --> 49:15.715
Okay!

49:16.326 --> 49:18.226
Now, all right.

49:18.862 --> 49:20.955
I gotta pee.
I really gotta pee.

49:25.568 --> 49:27.035
Look at that.

49:27.771 --> 49:29.830
Yo, Wheeler!
You in there?

49:34.444 --> 49:35.809
Oh, my God.

49:37.013 --> 49:38.708
Dude.
- Nice, man.

49:38.815 --> 49:40.373
Oh, boy.

49:40.483 --> 49:43.418
This is a classic case
of guy on the ground.

49:50.627 --> 49:52.117
I'm sorry.
I don't care.

49:52.228 --> 49:53.320
Okay.

49:53.563 --> 49:56.498
So I heard there was
some sex on the trip

49:56.599 --> 49:58.328
and some drugs, too.

49:59.035 --> 50:01.595
Only thing missing
was rock 'n' roll.

50:04.607 --> 50:06.768
What was Danny doing
with those Ambiens?

50:06.876 --> 50:09.276
He has trouble sleeping
outdoors.

50:10.146 --> 50:13.479
How did Wheeler come to be
naked in the center of camp?

50:13.583 --> 50:14.880
He was sleepwalking.

50:14.984 --> 50:16.849
Danny ever offer you drugs?
Well...

50:16.953 --> 50:18.648
Answer me.
No, ma'am.

50:19.022 --> 50:21.354
Did Wheeler ever
expose himself to you?

50:21.458 --> 50:22.720
Hell no!

50:25.128 --> 50:28.655
Fellows? These young gentlemen
here have decided your fates.

50:28.765 --> 50:32.599
If it was up to me, I'd lock you both
up, but the boys are saying you're okay.

50:32.702 --> 50:35.865
This is your last chance.
Start acting like Bigs.

50:38.408 --> 50:39.500
Thanks, guys.

50:39.609 --> 50:41.133
Suck it, <i>Reindeer Games!</i>

50:41.244 --> 50:42.404
I'm not Ben Affleck.

50:42.512 --> 50:44.377
You white?
Then you Ben Affleck.

50:44.481 --> 50:46.278
Right, Wheeler?
Yeah. You are white.

50:46.382 --> 50:47.872
That's true,
I am white.

50:47.984 --> 50:49.178
Let's go.

51:04.334 --> 51:05.392
Ready to go?

51:05.502 --> 51:07.129
Yeah. I'm ready. All right.

51:07.237 --> 51:08.363
Excellent!

51:11.040 --> 51:13.235
You are going down!

51:13.343 --> 51:15.538
Don't you mess
with my dark arts.

51:16.546 --> 51:17.774
You shall be slain.

51:17.881 --> 51:19.712
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.

51:20.617 --> 51:23.313
Fuck my cock! Sorry.

51:26.189 --> 51:28.214
I have a question, Wheeler.
- Yes, JJ.

51:28.324 --> 51:32.317
How many dates do you have to go out
with a girl before you get to touch her...

51:32.428 --> 51:33.895
Boobs?
Yeah.

51:34.731 --> 51:35.720
Good question.

51:35.832 --> 51:36.799
So you get
hit in the arm,

51:36.900 --> 51:38.458
you lose your arm.
Yes.

51:38.568 --> 51:40.035
You gotta put it behind
you, like this.

51:40.136 --> 51:42.104
You get hit in the leg,
you lose the leg.

51:42.205 --> 51:43.194
See you.

51:43.306 --> 51:44.534
So you gotta hop.

51:44.641 --> 51:45.835
You can't use it.
You gotta hop around?

51:45.942 --> 51:47.136
Yeah.
Yeah, you gotta hop.

51:47.243 --> 51:49.711
And if you get hit in
the chest, then you're...

51:51.281 --> 51:53.181
lifestyle you chose

51:53.283 --> 51:55.274
could lead to dying sad and alone?
- What?

51:55.385 --> 51:57.444
What about STDs? No.
Herpes?

51:57.554 --> 52:00.148
Gonorrhea? At the very least, crabs.
- What the hell?

52:00.256 --> 52:03.350
I don't have crabs. What have
you been telling them, Ronnie?

52:03.459 --> 52:04.949
You got crabs.

52:06.596 --> 52:07.620
Hi.

52:17.273 --> 52:20.174
Come on, whitey, dance! Break
it on down! Get it funky!

52:22.111 --> 52:23.373
He's out.

52:43.066 --> 52:44.693
Thank you.
Yep.

52:45.802 --> 52:47.531
Call her. Sweep
her off her feet.

52:47.637 --> 52:48.763
It's not that easy, Augie.

52:48.872 --> 52:50.396
Just let her know
how you feel.

52:50.506 --> 52:51.473
Give her one call.

52:51.574 --> 52:52.768
All right. I'll...

52:52.876 --> 52:54.468
Just get off my back.

52:54.577 --> 52:56.204
Did you know in
the 14th century that

52:56.312 --> 52:59.145
knights used to write love songs
and poems for the women they loved,

52:59.249 --> 53:00.477
even if she was married?

53:00.583 --> 53:01.914
No, I didn't know that.

53:02.018 --> 53:03.042
Well, there you go.

53:03.152 --> 53:04.449
It's her voice mail.

53:04.554 --> 53:06.419
Hey, Beth. How's it going? It's me.

53:06.522 --> 53:08.717
Tell her her hair is like 1,000 suns.
Look, I...

53:08.825 --> 53:10.918
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to get together.

53:11.027 --> 53:12.392
I know there's a lot
of stuff I'd like to say.

53:12.495 --> 53:13.689
Whispering eye.

53:13.796 --> 53:16.560
So, if you get a chance,
give me a call back and...

53:16.666 --> 53:18.725
You long for her whispering eye.
We can...

53:18.835 --> 53:20.166
We can see each other.

53:20.270 --> 53:21.237
I'd love to see you.

53:21.337 --> 53:22.395
And her whispering eye.

53:22.505 --> 53:24.473
And your whispering eye.

53:25.174 --> 53:26.698
All right. Bye.

53:28.177 --> 53:29.701
Whispering eye?

53:30.179 --> 53:31.976
It means vagina.

53:34.751 --> 53:36.343
It means vagina.

53:37.086 --> 53:38.610
That's a classy
move, man.

53:38.721 --> 53:39.915
It means vagina.

53:40.023 --> 53:43.322
Yeah. Get your whispering
eye in the cab, Augie.

53:43.826 --> 53:44.986
Vagina!

53:49.866 --> 53:50.924
Hey.

53:52.669 --> 53:53.693
Hi.

53:54.470 --> 53:55.698
Thanks for meeting me.

53:55.805 --> 53:58.706
I got you a <i>venti</i> chai,

53:59.175 --> 54:02.269
which is what they call
a large here, which I love.

54:02.378 --> 54:03.436
Wow.

54:03.980 --> 54:06.107
There's a transformation.

54:06.215 --> 54:09.378
Yes, well, you know, I've been doing
this community service for almost a month,

54:09.485 --> 54:13.478
and I really feel as if it's given
me some perspective on things.

54:13.589 --> 54:15.523
Well, that's great.
I hope that's true, Danny.

54:15.625 --> 54:17.388
So let's get married.

54:17.760 --> 54:19.751
Okay, I'm gonna leave now.
Wait.

54:19.862 --> 54:22.194
Danny, you are not taking
this breakup seriously.

54:22.298 --> 54:24.459
Yeah, because
I don't want it.

54:26.936 --> 54:28.369
Do you really think
I wanted this?

54:28.471 --> 54:32.066
Look. Hey. This is us.

54:32.175 --> 54:33.870
This is not us.

54:33.977 --> 54:37.174
We have not been us in a
while, because you are not you.

54:37.280 --> 54:39.009
Danny, you're not happy.

54:39.115 --> 54:42.243
I've been with you seven years, and
it's been getting progressively worse.

54:42.352 --> 54:47.221
And it makes me feel bad about
me that I can't make you happier.

54:47.323 --> 54:51.487
Where am I gonna find a girl who
hates all the same things I do?

54:51.594 --> 54:52.959
You're so romantic.

54:53.062 --> 54:54.461
Hey. Hey.

54:55.965 --> 54:57.592
"You complete me."

55:00.303 --> 55:02.396
"You had me at 'hello."'
Oh, God. Danny.

55:02.505 --> 55:03.529
Come on, Beth.
You're not...

55:03.639 --> 55:04.970
You're not hearing
what I'm saying to you.

55:05.074 --> 55:08.771
"I am just a girl standing in front
of a boy, telling her to love her."

55:08.878 --> 55:09.970
You don't even
know that one.

55:10.079 --> 55:11.273
Hey. Come on.

55:11.381 --> 55:13.076
"Who you gonna call?"

55:14.017 --> 55:15.314
"Ghost Busters."
Okay. You know what?

55:15.418 --> 55:19.548
No. I am committing to this breakup.
This is the best thing for us.

55:22.859 --> 55:25.657
You can call me if you
need legal advice.

55:35.405 --> 55:38.101
Come on! Let's kill
some Cacedonians!

55:38.207 --> 55:41.540
And I got a little
something-something for you to wear.

55:43.846 --> 55:45.108
Yeah, I'm not
gonna wear this.

55:45.214 --> 55:46.340
No?

55:47.050 --> 55:50.383
Soon enough.
Soon enough you'll want it.

55:50.486 --> 55:51.475
Yeah.

55:52.188 --> 55:55.385
Yo, Wheeler. What up, dog? You
scoundrel. What are you doing, man?

55:55.491 --> 55:57.891
Yo, Hogan's having another
party tonight, man. You gotta go.

55:57.994 --> 56:00.861
There's gonna be a lot of
sweet-ass pussy there, girl pussy.

56:00.963 --> 56:03.124
Ooh! Uh...

56:04.333 --> 56:06.767
Thanks for the offer.
Maybe some other time.

56:06.869 --> 56:08.962
You're the king, Wheeler.
You're the king.

56:09.072 --> 56:12.098
Dude, don't give up that
sweet-ass pussy on my account.

56:12.208 --> 56:13.334
I'll go with you.

56:13.443 --> 56:14.808
Okay. If you say so.

56:14.911 --> 56:16.606
All right.
You're my PIC, Wheeler.

56:16.712 --> 56:18.612
What's a PIC?
Partner in crime.

56:18.714 --> 56:21.205
You're my PIC. Just don't
cock-block me tonight.

56:21.317 --> 56:23.080
Wouldn't dream of it.
We'll have a great time.

56:23.186 --> 56:24.915
We'll go to the party,
we'll get some zah,

56:25.021 --> 56:25.988
play some Xbox.

56:26.089 --> 56:27.249
Damn straight.

56:27.356 --> 56:31.520
Countrymen, smell
the battle in the air!

56:31.627 --> 56:33.925
Esplen,
Goddess of Navalore.

56:34.030 --> 56:37.397
Venus herself would be jealous.
Braman, good to see you.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.229
Good morrow, sir!
Good morrow to you.

56:39.335 --> 56:40.393
Good morning.

56:40.503 --> 56:43.563
Keep your blades sharp
but your wits sharper.

56:43.673 --> 56:47.700
Ah! Gleebo, look at you.
A visage.

56:47.810 --> 56:50.005
Men, get ready to
dance with swords!

56:51.214 --> 56:56.413
Alack and allay! What lovely vassal
has Mercury delivered upon us today

56:56.519 --> 56:59.147
and in such strange
and frightful attire?

56:59.255 --> 57:00.381
Let us thank the gods

57:00.490 --> 57:03.755
for sending us such a brave
and valiant warrior to Xanthia.

57:03.860 --> 57:04.918
All hail Lunesta.

57:05.027 --> 57:06.324
Hail, Lunesta!

57:06.429 --> 57:07.953
How's it going?
Lunesta?

57:08.064 --> 57:09.827
Isn't that a sleeping pill?

57:09.932 --> 57:12.992
Yeah. It's 'cause I send my enemies
to their eternal resting place.

57:13.102 --> 57:15.366
"To sleep,
perchance to dream."

57:15.471 --> 57:18.872
Well, welcome, Lunesta.
We bid you good battle.

57:18.975 --> 57:21.341
Prepare to have your
worldview rocked.

57:21.444 --> 57:22.809
Let's do this.

57:22.912 --> 57:24.379
Let's do this,
we shall!

57:33.656 --> 57:36.955
The battle begins!

57:53.876 --> 57:55.241
Turn and fight, coward!

57:55.344 --> 57:57.835
You'll never catch me!

58:02.752 --> 58:04.413
What have you got?

58:05.288 --> 58:07.552
The Cacedonians have
our kinsmen surrounded.

58:07.657 --> 58:09.682
Leave them for Davith.

58:11.527 --> 58:14.325
Prepare for
a Glencracken!

58:19.969 --> 58:21.766
Comrades!

58:21.871 --> 58:23.361
Cacedonia!

58:27.543 --> 58:29.534
The king is
unprotected.

58:29.645 --> 58:32.136
I shall approach him
from the rear.

58:33.916 --> 58:35.349
God save you!

58:42.458 --> 58:45.222
Oh, fuck me. All right.
You got it. I got you.

58:45.328 --> 58:46.818
That's...
You look amazing.

58:46.929 --> 58:47.896
Thanks, man.

58:48.231 --> 58:49.562
You're dead.

58:49.665 --> 58:50.654
No way.
I killed you.

58:50.766 --> 58:53.166
You didn't kill me.
Now exeunt this battlefield.

58:53.269 --> 58:54.258
Wait a second.
That's not fair.

58:54.370 --> 58:55.428
Listen,
you little twerp.

58:55.538 --> 58:58.098
You've been slain by the
mighty king. Now get lost,

58:58.207 --> 59:00.072
and take some pride
in dying an honorable death.

59:00.176 --> 59:01.268
No, but I killed you.

59:01.377 --> 59:03.345
You can't kill me after
I already killed you.

59:03.446 --> 59:04.538
Davith of Glencracken.

59:04.647 --> 59:05.807
Yes, my liege.

59:05.915 --> 59:06.973
Didst he slay me?

59:07.083 --> 59:08.345
He doth not slay the king.

59:08.451 --> 59:09.577
You weren't even here
when it happened!

59:09.685 --> 59:10.879
Was too here.

59:10.987 --> 59:13.251
Everyone, I'm telling you
the truth. I killed the king!

59:13.356 --> 59:14.618
I...

59:15.725 --> 59:17.090
Why don't you
believe me? I swear...

59:17.193 --> 59:18.558
Dost the Xanthian
weep like a maiden?

59:19.729 --> 59:21.287
Why are you
laughing at me?

59:22.231 --> 59:23.255
What are you doing?

59:23.366 --> 59:24.526
Danny, I didn't...

59:24.634 --> 59:26.966
I killed the king.
- Oh, my God.

59:27.069 --> 59:28.297
You're lying.

59:28.838 --> 59:30.430
Are you calling me a liar?
You're a liar.

59:30.539 --> 59:32.973
Danny, just drop it. Let's just
get out of here. It doesn't matter.

59:33.075 --> 59:36.238
Are you telling me a kid
could slay the mighty king?

59:36.345 --> 59:39.644
Not a real king,
but you, yeah.

59:39.749 --> 59:41.444
You're lying. I can tell.
Danny, stop.

59:41.550 --> 59:42.847
He killed you.
Give him your hat.

59:42.952 --> 59:44.044
It's a crown.

59:44.153 --> 59:45.142
Give him your hat.
Danny.

59:45.254 --> 59:46.983
It's a crown, dude!

59:48.824 --> 59:49.916
Dude!
You're a liar.

59:50.026 --> 59:51.994
It's a piece of plastic.

59:52.795 --> 59:53.921
Okay, game over.

59:55.264 --> 59:57.664
You both are disqualified
from Laire forever.

59:57.767 --> 59:59.792
What?
Are you kidding me?

01:00:04.006 --> 01:00:05.667
Augie! Augie!

01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:10.373
Augie.

01:00:10.479 --> 01:00:11.639
Leave me alone.

01:00:11.847 --> 01:00:13.439
Look. I'm sorry.

01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:16.313
No, you're not sorry.
You don't care about any of this!

01:00:16.419 --> 01:00:18.216
This is so unfair!

01:00:22.291 --> 01:00:24.486
Hey, come on, buddy.
I'm not your buddy!

01:00:24.593 --> 01:00:26.322
You're only doing this because
the judge is making you.

01:00:26.429 --> 01:00:28.488
And you know what?
That's fine if you don't give a shit,

01:00:28.597 --> 01:00:30.827
but you don't have to ruin it
for me, because I do give a shit!

01:00:30.933 --> 01:00:32.730
I give lots of shits!

01:00:36.572 --> 01:00:37.732
Look, it's gonna be okay.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.239
No, it's not gonna be okay!

01:00:39.342 --> 01:00:43.403
You're the worst mentor ever! No wonder
your girlfriend left you, you asshole!

01:00:56.058 --> 01:00:57.082
Yo, Wheeler.
What's up, man?

01:00:57.193 --> 01:00:58.626
Hey. What's up?

01:00:58.728 --> 01:01:00.821
Okay, kid. Let's mingle.

01:01:01.564 --> 01:01:02.997
Let's do it.

01:01:05.868 --> 01:01:06.994
Yeah.

01:01:10.239 --> 01:01:12.104
Excuse me, miss.
Yes?

01:01:13.542 --> 01:01:15.942
You're sexy like
a chocolate strawberry.

01:01:16.779 --> 01:01:17.871
Who told you to say that?

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.106
That's Wheeler,

01:01:19.215 --> 01:01:20.512
my PIC.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.654
Nice.
Come on, baby!

01:01:26.756 --> 01:01:28.383
Pass it.
No.

01:01:28.491 --> 01:01:29.480
No.
No!

01:01:29.592 --> 01:01:30.923
Hey. I'm gonna
rock a squirt,

01:01:31.026 --> 01:01:32.220
so you watch the kid
for a few minutes?

01:01:32.328 --> 01:01:35.024
Sure thing. You're the king,
Wheeler. You're the king.

01:01:36.565 --> 01:01:37.657
Yeah, okay.

01:01:52.148 --> 01:01:53.274
Long line.

01:01:53.382 --> 01:01:55.350
I've seen longer.

01:01:55.451 --> 01:01:57.976
Have we met?
I don't know. Have we?

01:01:59.789 --> 01:02:01.484
Well, what do you do?

01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:04.184
Well, I'm kind of
on hiatus right now,

01:02:04.293 --> 01:02:07.490
but my job is to dress up like a
minotaur and keep kids off drugs.

01:02:07.596 --> 01:02:10.463
Well, that's how I know you.
I teach at Morgan Elementary.

01:02:10.566 --> 01:02:13.399
That's so funny, 'cause I
think elementary school is hot.

01:02:18.454 --> 01:02:19.546
Hey.

01:02:20.389 --> 01:02:22.220
What are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.

01:02:22.324 --> 01:02:23.848
No, I don't want to
talk to you right now.

01:02:23.959 --> 01:02:25.051
Hey, Danny.

01:02:25.161 --> 01:02:28.255
You decided to come for dinner.
Great. Come on in.

01:02:28.364 --> 01:02:30.764
Thanks.
God damn it!

01:02:32.635 --> 01:02:34.398
What's up his cooz?

01:02:38.941 --> 01:02:40.772
I should take a piss
more often.

01:02:42.778 --> 01:02:44.245
I don't know.
I don't got a raincoat.

01:02:44.447 --> 01:02:46.881
Don't worry.
I'm very pro-choice.

01:02:47.049 --> 01:02:48.346
Okay.

01:02:48.718 --> 01:02:50.481
God, I'm really
kicking your ass.

01:02:50.586 --> 01:02:51.814
That's because
this is soccer.

01:02:51.921 --> 01:02:53.218
Black folks
don't play soccer.

01:02:53.322 --> 01:02:54.880
That guy's black.
Right there.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.090
You sit down,
young man.

01:03:00.196 --> 01:03:02.721
You have
been a bad boy!

01:03:02.832 --> 01:03:03.992
I've been bad.

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.795
And now you're gonna
have to stay after class.

01:03:05.935 --> 01:03:07.698
Oh, man. Look.

01:03:07.803 --> 01:03:10.670
Even though this is one of my top
four all-time fantasies, I can't, okay?

01:03:10.773 --> 01:03:13.298
I want to, but I gotta
go find my friend.

01:03:14.076 --> 01:03:15.338
Oh, yeah?

01:03:16.212 --> 01:03:17.338
You sure?

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.279
Oh, my God.

01:03:20.049 --> 01:03:21.983
Do what you need to do.

01:03:22.084 --> 01:03:24.314
He'll be fine.
He's 10. Come here.

01:03:24.453 --> 01:03:25.420
Let's go.

01:03:27.306 --> 01:03:27.829
Uh-oh!

01:03:27.972 --> 01:03:29.462
This is how it ends.

01:03:29.574 --> 01:03:31.132
Game winner! I win!

01:03:31.242 --> 01:03:32.300
Let's go, Michael.

01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:33.843
Man, forget you, man.

01:03:33.945 --> 01:03:35.537
That's booty, son.

01:03:35.647 --> 01:03:36.875
Let's go. I'm ready.

01:03:38.249 --> 01:03:41.582
They don't call me the king
of this game for nothing!

01:03:45.857 --> 01:03:48.155
Wheeler, where you at?

01:03:53.364 --> 01:03:56.231
Wheeler? Wheeler. Wheeler.

01:03:56.634 --> 01:03:57.623
Wheeler.

01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:02.899
So, Danny, you must be glad
that you're almost done

01:04:03.007 --> 01:04:05.771
with your required
time with Augie.

01:04:06.978 --> 01:04:09.105
How much time
do you have left?

01:04:09.747 --> 01:04:11.647
Eleven, 12 hours or so.

01:04:11.749 --> 01:04:13.512
Jeez, Augie. You're acting
like your goldfish died.

01:04:13.618 --> 01:04:15.586
I don't have a goldfish, Jim.
You know what I mean.

01:04:15.687 --> 01:04:19.384
You're acting like as if you
had a goldfish and it died.

01:04:20.325 --> 01:04:22.919
Augie kind of got
screwed over today.

01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:24.187
I killed the king, Mom.

01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:25.694
Okay.
- He killed the king.

01:04:25.797 --> 01:04:27.992
All right. All right. Don't
encourage him. He did kill the king.

01:04:28.099 --> 01:04:30.226
But he was lying to everyone and
told everyone that he killed me.

01:04:30.335 --> 01:04:32.360
I don't wanna hear any more
about your Dungeons & Dragons

01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:33.732
or your fruity Cocoa Puffs...

01:04:33.838 --> 01:04:35.305
It's all fairyland
with him.

01:04:35.406 --> 01:04:38.307
We're trying to keep it...
We're trying to keep it real.

01:04:38.409 --> 01:04:40.639
The Goddess of Navalore
saw me cry, Mom.

01:04:40.745 --> 01:04:43.179
Hey, Augie, when I was a
little kid, I accidentally

01:04:43.281 --> 01:04:45.306
crapped my pants
in front of a girl I liked,

01:04:45.416 --> 01:04:47.611
so I feel your pain.

01:04:47.719 --> 01:04:50.984
Well, he likes girls. That's a
good thing. That's a surprise to me.

01:04:51.089 --> 01:04:52.954
Doesn't matter anyway.
He got me kicked out.

01:04:53.057 --> 01:04:54.718
What?
- What? You're kidding me.

01:04:54.826 --> 01:04:55.815
They can kick you out?

01:04:55.927 --> 01:04:57.417
Yeah, I'm banned.
This is a great thing.

01:04:57.529 --> 01:04:58.860
Way to go, big guy.
Does this mean

01:04:58.963 --> 01:05:00.055
we can finally get rid
of those boots

01:05:00.165 --> 01:05:04.261
and that God-awful cape that you made
out of my tablecloth? I'm so sick of this.

01:05:04.369 --> 01:05:05.427
I'll burn them up in a...

01:05:05.537 --> 01:05:07.505
We'll have a bonfire.
We'll make a thing of it.

01:05:07.605 --> 01:05:09.698
Don't you want him to wear
what makes him happy?

01:05:11.176 --> 01:05:12.143
Yes. Yes, I do.
Yes.

01:05:12.243 --> 01:05:14.734
You know when I want him to
wear what makes him happy?

01:05:14.846 --> 01:05:18.373
On October 31st.
Halloween, go nuts.

01:05:18.483 --> 01:05:19.745
Wear lipstick.
I don't care.

01:05:19.851 --> 01:05:21.011
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:21.119 --> 01:05:22.916
You know, dress like a nun.
Sure.

01:05:23.021 --> 01:05:24.318
We're gonna have
a celebration

01:05:24.422 --> 01:05:27.448
to celebrate you joining
the rest of the world.

01:05:27.559 --> 01:05:29.550
Becoming a normal kid.
He is a normal kid.

01:05:29.661 --> 01:05:31.288
You think he's normal?
- Yeah, I think he's normal.

01:05:31.396 --> 01:05:32.920
You think he's normal.
He's normal.

01:05:33.031 --> 01:05:34.020
When I was his age,

01:05:34.132 --> 01:05:37.226
I had four, five girlfriends at
one time. Didn't I tell you that?

01:05:37.335 --> 01:05:38.996
He was fucking
his cousin.

01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:40.661
I wasn't fucking
my cousin. I...

01:05:40.772 --> 01:05:43.070
We kissed, because I didn't
know she was my cousin,

01:05:43.174 --> 01:05:46.701
but when I found out, I stopped
kissing her, but I fucked her friends.

01:05:46.811 --> 01:05:48.745
I fucked my
cousin's friends.

01:05:48.846 --> 01:05:52.111
I think that Augie is just having
kind of a tough time in life,

01:05:52.217 --> 01:05:53.878
which sounds pretty normal
to me. Life is tough.

01:05:53.985 --> 01:05:55.782
It is tough. But you know
what? This is my point.

01:05:55.887 --> 01:05:58.754
It's tougher when you...
With parents like you?

01:05:58.856 --> 01:06:01.381
Excuse me?
What did you just say?

01:06:01.492 --> 01:06:04.825
I said it is tough, but I think
it's tougher with parents like you.

01:06:04.929 --> 01:06:06.157
I thought that's
what you just said.

01:06:06.264 --> 01:06:07.424
I don't know
how you do it, kid.

01:06:07.532 --> 01:06:10.524
I mean, I thought my life sucked.
Jesus Christ, I really feel for you.

01:06:10.635 --> 01:06:11.659
Okay. That's enough.

01:06:11.769 --> 01:06:13.066
Don't listen to
them, all right?

01:06:13.171 --> 01:06:15.143
Do what makes you happy.
You want to wear a cape?

01:06:15.144 --> 01:06:15.537
Wear a cape.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.335
You want to wear a suit of armor?
Who gives a shit?

01:06:17.442 --> 01:06:19.842
You know what? I would never
have invited you over for moussaka

01:06:19.944 --> 01:06:23.380
if I'd known you were gonna
be such a prick. Excuse me.

01:06:23.481 --> 01:06:24.778
Augie, screw them.

01:06:24.882 --> 01:06:25.906
Do what makes you happy.
Hey. Whoa!

01:06:26.017 --> 01:06:28.164
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Do what makes you happy.

01:06:28.165 --> 01:06:28.713
Hey, buddy...

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.048
I'd like you to
leave now, please.

01:06:30.154 --> 01:06:31.416
I figure you're probably

01:06:31.522 --> 01:06:33.285
not gonna sign my
hours sheet now.

01:06:33.391 --> 01:06:34.380
Go fuck yourself.

01:06:34.492 --> 01:06:37.188
That's what I thought.
Hey, Augie, I'm sorry.

01:06:37.295 --> 01:06:38.922
Get the hell out.

01:06:40.465 --> 01:06:43.059
I'd be psyched if he was my kid.
Please.

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:47.196
And you know what,
sweetheart?

01:06:47.305 --> 01:06:49.569
It's not that we're not
psyched that you're our kid.

01:06:49.674 --> 01:06:52.643
We're psyched. I'm so
psyched, I can't stand it.

01:06:52.744 --> 01:06:54.735
Your mom's psyched
that you're her kid.

01:06:54.846 --> 01:06:57.041
May I please
be excused, Mom?

01:07:11.629 --> 01:07:13.096
Hey. Where's Ronnie?

01:07:13.197 --> 01:07:14.630
Who's Ronnie, dude?

01:07:14.732 --> 01:07:17.166
Oh, shit. Ronnie!

01:07:17.735 --> 01:07:18.963
Ronnie.

01:07:20.672 --> 01:07:22.731
What's up, man?
Hey. How you doing?

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.364
Ro-Ro.

01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:27.469
Anybody see the
little kid I was with?

01:07:29.714 --> 01:07:31.477
<i> This is Karen,</i>
<i>Ronnie's mother.</i>

01:07:31.582 --> 01:07:34.050
<i>Ronnie was supposed to be</i>
<i>home a few hours ago.</i>

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.309
<i>This is Karen again.</i>

01:07:36.421 --> 01:07:40.050
<i>Can you guys please call me</i>
<i>and let me know where you are?</i>

01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:44.823
<i>Ronnie just got in. He walked all the way home.</i>
<i>What the hell...</i>

01:07:44.996 --> 01:07:46.093
You're out.
Look...

01:07:46.197 --> 01:07:48.825
No, no, no, no. It's over.
You blew it. It's done. Okay?

01:07:48.933 --> 01:07:51.731
I hear what you're saying.
We're very sorry, but we're 11 hours short.

01:07:51.969 --> 01:07:54.631
And you're gonna stay 11 hours
short, okay? I don't know.

01:07:54.739 --> 01:07:57.469
Parents don't want you hanging around
with their kids for some reason.

01:07:57.575 --> 01:08:00.601
So you BSed a BSer.

01:08:00.712 --> 01:08:04.546
Good for you! I hope you feel
good about yourself, God damn it!

01:08:06.117 --> 01:08:09.109
You know, I could be
back in New York

01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:12.280
doing cocaine in the
Village, but I'm not.

01:08:13.458 --> 01:08:16.188
You know why?
Kids come first.

01:08:17.462 --> 01:08:18.952
They don't come
first for you, do they?

01:08:19.063 --> 01:08:21.554
They come second
to your selfishness.

01:08:22.367 --> 01:08:24.698
So why don't you
two guys go home,

01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:27.167
put down some lines
of selfishness,

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:29.033
which is your blow,

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.939
close the shades, take
the phone off the hook,

01:08:33.044 --> 01:08:35.511
grab a straw and snort?

01:08:35.613 --> 01:08:38.741
And don't expect me
to testify on your behalf.

01:08:39.417 --> 01:08:41.817
You're not Sturdy Wings
material.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:51.491
I think you guys are gonna
have to go to jail.

01:08:51.595 --> 01:08:52.823
The only thing we can do now

01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:56.229
is make a case at the hearing
that you did your best.

01:08:56.334 --> 01:08:58.359
It's gonna take some serious
lawyering on my part.

01:08:58.502 --> 01:09:01.495
Yeah. Beth, please.
Lawyer the shit out of it.

01:09:01.606 --> 01:09:04.040
I just can't promise
anything.

01:09:04.142 --> 01:09:05.734
Yes, Wheeler?
Question.

01:09:05.843 --> 01:09:08.277
Maybe a stupid one, but
I'm just spit-balling here.

01:09:08.379 --> 01:09:10.643
The Get Out of Jail Free
card,

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:13.478
is that based on
something that exists or...

01:09:13.584 --> 01:09:15.984
That wasn't
a stupid question.

01:09:16.087 --> 01:09:17.111
That's real.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.483
It's real in the
game of Monopoly.

01:09:18.589 --> 01:09:20.955
Yeah, it's based
on true events.

01:09:21.492 --> 01:09:22.857
How... What do you mean?

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.018
Chance.

01:09:32.737 --> 01:09:33.863
I can't believe
we're going to jail.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:34.960
Believe it.

01:09:35.072 --> 01:09:36.835
Hey, maybe you'll
roll doubles. You know?

01:09:36.941 --> 01:09:38.169
If not, you just
miss three turns.

01:09:38.276 --> 01:09:39.368
Game face, bro.

01:09:39.477 --> 01:09:41.138
I told you.
Game face.

01:09:41.245 --> 01:09:42.906
Enough with the
game face, all right?

01:09:43.014 --> 01:09:44.447
This isn't beach volleyball.

01:09:44.549 --> 01:09:47.814
Is it not? Because,
if you think about it,

01:09:47.919 --> 01:09:51.116
the net is like your goals
in life, and you are the ball.

01:09:51.221 --> 01:09:53.747
And you can spike the ball
down, or you, over the net.

01:09:53.858 --> 01:09:56.383
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Then you go into sidelines.

01:09:56.494 --> 01:09:57.483
It's bad enough
I'm going to jail.

01:09:57.595 --> 01:09:59.460
I can't take it anymore
with you yapping away.

01:09:59.564 --> 01:10:00.553
Yap, yap, yip, yip.

01:10:00.665 --> 01:10:02.428
"Bang your drum, bro."
Maybe I should be like you.

01:10:02.533 --> 01:10:05.024
"I hate myself, yet I'm
better than everyone."

01:10:05.136 --> 01:10:07.036
You're one to talk.
You took a 10-year-old to a party

01:10:07.138 --> 01:10:09.003
and left him so you
could go get a blow job.

01:10:09.106 --> 01:10:10.198
Hey.

01:10:10.308 --> 01:10:11.798
It wasn't a blow job.
We fucked.

01:10:11.909 --> 01:10:13.900
Please! Watch
your language!

01:10:14.011 --> 01:10:15.535
Sorry.
Sorry.

01:10:16.881 --> 01:10:18.849
You are an
S-H-I-T-T-Y friend.

01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:20.542
He can spell.

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.983
I'm not your friend.

01:10:24.622 --> 01:10:25.589
Oh.

01:10:25.857 --> 01:10:27.324
You wanna go?

01:10:30.328 --> 01:10:31.352
Stop it!

01:10:36.934 --> 01:10:39.869
There you go, Danny.
Now you got no friends.

01:10:42.874 --> 01:10:44.034
Sorry.

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:51.480
Hello?
Hey, Ro-Ro. It's Wheeler.

01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:41.191
So you guys have to
be at the courthouse

01:11:41.299 --> 01:11:43.062
no later than
3:00 p.m., okay?

01:11:43.167 --> 01:11:44.156
All right.

01:11:44.268 --> 01:11:46.429
<i>Please, do not be late.</i>
No. I know.

01:11:46.537 --> 01:11:48.164
No, I'll be there.

01:12:38.022 --> 01:12:40.547
You don't always have to get
breakfast this time of day.

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:43.620
Hiya, King.

01:12:43.728 --> 01:12:45.218
No, no, no. I don't
mean to cause trouble.

01:12:45.329 --> 01:12:47.695
I just wanted to come
by and apologize

01:12:47.798 --> 01:12:49.891
for the way that
I behaved last time.

01:12:50.001 --> 01:12:55.064
I... I lost my temper when I saw
you last, and that was regrettable.

01:12:55.172 --> 01:12:57.572
Not to mention highly
illegal, you jackanape.

01:12:58.776 --> 01:13:01.370
I know. It's just that my...
Denver omelet?

01:13:01.479 --> 01:13:03.504
Right here. Thank you.

01:13:04.749 --> 01:13:06.649
It's just my friend
was upset, you see,

01:13:06.751 --> 01:13:08.981
and he thought
he'd stabbed you.

01:13:09.086 --> 01:13:11.247
He hadn't.
Of course he hadn't.

01:13:12.023 --> 01:13:13.047
Go on.

01:13:13.157 --> 01:13:14.249
It's just that...

01:13:15.593 --> 01:13:19.495
I accidentally cast an
unbreakable madness spell on him.

01:13:21.032 --> 01:13:23.000
Well, that was stupid.
- I know, right?

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:24.362
I didn't mean to.

01:13:24.468 --> 01:13:25.628
You guys are reckless
out there.

01:13:25.736 --> 01:13:29.228
Yeah. Unsafe. Okay, I had a
protection spell on me. All right?

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:32.104
But it had faded off when you
touched me, so don't flatter yourself

01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:33.699
thinking you can come
back at me, okay,

01:13:33.811 --> 01:13:36.575
'cause I would love to see
you penetrate me again.

01:13:36.681 --> 01:13:38.308
Anyway, I was
just wondering

01:13:38.416 --> 01:13:40.680
if maybe you could
see it in your heart

01:13:40.785 --> 01:13:44.050
to let him fight today
on the battlefield.

01:13:44.155 --> 01:13:46.749
He loves Laire
more than anything.

01:13:46.857 --> 01:13:50.088
He's just a kid, but he's
got the heart of a lion...

01:13:50.861 --> 01:13:51.828
Hmm.

01:13:53.197 --> 01:13:54.755
...and the eye of the tiger.

01:13:54.865 --> 01:13:55.854
Hmm.

01:13:55.966 --> 01:13:57.194
More coffee?

01:13:57.301 --> 01:13:58.461
No, I'm decaf.

01:13:58.569 --> 01:13:59.695
Okay.

01:13:59.804 --> 01:14:01.203
If he be so brave,

01:14:01.305 --> 01:14:04.297
why doth he not show
his face here today?

01:14:04.408 --> 01:14:06.342
Do you fight
all his battles?

01:14:06.444 --> 01:14:07.411
Hmm.

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.514
He knows not I'm here.

01:14:11.649 --> 01:14:12.638
Hmm.

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:16.345
He hath too
much pride.

01:14:16.954 --> 01:14:17.921
Hmm.

01:14:21.158 --> 01:14:24.355
Magic healing
potion. Wizards...

01:14:25.429 --> 01:14:27.056
How's it going?

01:14:29.867 --> 01:14:31.562
Tell your kinsman

01:14:34.371 --> 01:14:36.965
we shall see him
on the battlefield today.

01:14:37.074 --> 01:14:39.440
Thank you.
Thank you, noble king.

01:14:42.513 --> 01:14:43.537
Really?

01:14:43.647 --> 01:14:44.614
Mmm-hmm.

01:14:45.249 --> 01:14:47.046
You know
you want it.

01:14:51.589 --> 01:14:53.819
Now exit my
Burger Hole, boy.

01:14:55.126 --> 01:14:58.527
Make it known to the Xanthians that
if they let Augie fight with them,

01:14:58.629 --> 01:15:01.996
we'll destroy each and every
one of them, without mercy,

01:15:02.099 --> 01:15:04.567
before the first
apple-cider break.

01:15:14.578 --> 01:15:16.910
Hey, what's up, my PIC?

01:15:23.521 --> 01:15:26.115
Ronnie. Ronnie.

01:15:28.692 --> 01:15:30.887
to listen to me

01:15:30.995 --> 01:15:35.261
and listen good.
I am a very animalistic woman,

01:15:35.366 --> 01:15:37.459
a very animalistic woman,

01:15:37.568 --> 01:15:41.971
and when it comes to my son,
I am a lioness,

01:15:42.072 --> 01:15:43.437
a black Sheba.

01:15:43.541 --> 01:15:45.099
Black Sheba.
Yeah, but listen...

01:15:45.209 --> 01:15:46.301
I am a lioness,

01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:49.174
and that boy is my cub,

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.239
and if you let anything bad
happen to my cub,

01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:57.650
I will claw your ass up
until you shit sideways.

01:15:57.755 --> 01:15:59.780
Do you understand?
Yes.

01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:02.518
You'll tear me up so bad that when
I shit, it'll come out sideways.

01:16:02.626 --> 01:16:04.389
I understand.
Okay.

01:16:07.164 --> 01:16:08.791
It's just, Ronnie looks
up to you. Okay?

01:16:08.899 --> 01:16:11.299
He doesn't need another
man leaving him behind.

01:16:11.402 --> 01:16:13.666
I know. I know.
I fucked up, okay?

01:16:13.771 --> 01:16:15.739
I... The kid acts
so tough,

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.603
I didn't know I could
hurt him, you know?

01:16:17.708 --> 01:16:19.676
I'm determined to make
it up to him. All right?

01:16:19.777 --> 01:16:23.645
What I'm trying to say is that
when I get out of prison,

01:16:23.747 --> 01:16:26.079
could I hang out with
your 10-year-old son?

01:16:26.183 --> 01:16:29.118
Well, you're gonna have
to ask him yourself.

01:16:31.455 --> 01:16:33.184
Hey. Ronnie.

01:16:34.091 --> 01:16:35.058
Um...

01:16:36.093 --> 01:16:38.254
Look. I'm sorry, okay?

01:16:39.363 --> 01:16:41.263
I know I don't deserve it,

01:16:41.365 --> 01:16:44.857
but Sturdy Wings or no Sturdy
Wings, I want to be your Big.

01:16:47.838 --> 01:16:52.275
Okay. I'm your Little, and
you're my Big. I like that.

01:16:55.292 --> 01:16:59.589
Can I tell you how deeply, deeply I
regret this situation with this latest Big?

01:16:59.697 --> 01:17:03.258
It's completely unacceptable,
and at Sturdy Wings,

01:17:03.367 --> 01:17:04.698
it's not how we roll.

01:17:04.802 --> 01:17:08.499
So I'm going to guarantee
you that Mr. Gary

01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:13.367
is our most experienced
and dependable volunteer.

01:17:13.477 --> 01:17:15.035
Let me
put it this way.

01:17:15.145 --> 01:17:17.636
If I had a nickel for every year
that I've been with Sturdy Wings,

01:17:17.748 --> 01:17:20.717
I would have enough
money to

01:17:20.818 --> 01:17:22.285
play a game of <i>Pac-Man.</i>

01:17:23.287 --> 01:17:24.379
Been five years.

01:17:24.488 --> 01:17:26.854
And if I stay with Sturdy
Wings for another five years,

01:17:26.957 --> 01:17:29.357
then I'll have enough
for another round.

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.927
Another round of <i>Pac-Man.</i>
- Right.

01:17:31.028 --> 01:17:33.792
Five cents for every year,
times five...

01:17:33.898 --> 01:17:34.922
That's 25.
We get it.

01:17:35.032 --> 01:17:36.431
That's 25 cents.
- That's a quarter.

01:17:36.534 --> 01:17:38.764
But the <i>Pac-Man</i> here,
I think it's 50 cents.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.801
What are you doing here?
I'm breaking you out.

01:17:44.942 --> 01:17:47.308
There's a nation at war.
Are you in?

01:17:47.411 --> 01:17:48.810
Aye.

01:17:48.913 --> 01:17:51.211
Aye... I am, too.
Come on.

01:17:51.315 --> 01:17:53.749
<i>Wheeler hasn't called me back.
Are you guys gonna make it or what?</i>

01:17:53.851 --> 01:17:56.513
I don't know, Beth. I mean, I can't
speak for Wheeler, but I'll be there.

01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:58.781
<i>You gotta promise me.</i>
Yeah, I promise. I just...

01:17:58.889 --> 01:18:00.823
I'm helping Augie with something,
and then I'm on my way, okay?

01:18:00.925 --> 01:18:03.450
<i>County courthouse, 3:00.</i>
All right.

01:18:04.862 --> 01:18:07.524
Man, I'm gonna kick
some Cacedonian ass.

01:18:07.631 --> 01:18:09.098
Yeah, totally.

01:18:10.501 --> 01:18:11.695
It's Artonius.

01:18:11.802 --> 01:18:13.269
Bid him good morrow.

01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:15.133
Greetings, Artonius.

01:18:15.239 --> 01:18:16.763
Get ready for some pain.

01:18:17.241 --> 01:18:20.005
What? What? Wait. No, no, no.
No, you can't do that.

01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:21.941
<i>You're out of Xanthia.</i>
What are you talking about?

01:18:22.046 --> 01:18:23.445
<i>Sorry, Blufgan.</i>

01:18:23.547 --> 01:18:24.844
Forget it, Danny.

01:18:25.916 --> 01:18:27.543
They said I'm too
much of a liability.

01:18:27.651 --> 01:18:30.176
They're kicking me
out of Xanthia.

01:18:30.287 --> 01:18:32.221
What? Are you serious?

01:18:33.557 --> 01:18:35.184
Screw them. We'll
start our own country.

01:18:35.292 --> 01:18:36.350
We can't.

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:39.725
All my costumes have the same
colors and same symbols as Xanthia.

01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:42.196
And besides, you can't start
a country with two people.

01:18:42.299 --> 01:18:44.859
No? What's the minimum?

01:18:49.039 --> 01:18:50.267
Where you going?

01:18:50.741 --> 01:18:52.003
You can't go anywhere.
Come on.

01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:54.677
What do you want,
asshole?

01:18:54.778 --> 01:18:56.973
Actually, we
need your help.

01:19:38.322 --> 01:19:40.756
I can't believe
my eyes.

01:19:40.958 --> 01:19:42.949
A minotaur!

01:20:05.516 --> 01:20:06.847
Augie?

01:20:07.484 --> 01:20:08.746
Where are you?

01:20:13.924 --> 01:20:15.255
<i>Hear he, hear he.</i>

01:20:16.093 --> 01:20:19.460
This is a battle to the
last man standing,

01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:22.594
and the victor
shall rule the realm.

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:26.466
There'll be no magical
rejuvenation powder today.

01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:29.596
Instead, if you are killed,
you are done!

01:20:30.274 --> 01:20:33.835
Fight well, and may
the best country win!

01:20:37.047 --> 01:20:39.447
Stay close, like
cotton on a lamb.

01:20:41.852 --> 01:20:45.049
Brothers and sisters of the
new nation of Kiss-My-Anthia,

01:20:45.155 --> 01:20:49.717
I stand here before you not as
the Augie Farks you once knew.

01:20:49.827 --> 01:20:52.819
Today I stand before
you a warrior!

01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:54.761
For time eternal,

01:20:54.865 --> 01:20:57.800
I have let the naysayers
of this world bring me down.

01:20:57.901 --> 01:21:00.768
They used to say,
"You shouldn't fight.

01:21:00.871 --> 01:21:03.305
"You should be
embarrassed of yourself.

01:21:03.407 --> 01:21:05.807
"You look like a young
Marvin Hamlisch."

01:21:05.909 --> 01:21:08.275
Well, you know what
I say to those naysayers?

01:21:08.378 --> 01:21:11.279
I say nay! I will fight!

01:21:11.381 --> 01:21:13.008
I will not be embarrassed!

01:21:13.117 --> 01:21:15.312
Who the fuck
is Marvin Hamlisch?

01:21:15.419 --> 01:21:16.647
He wrote the music
to <i>The Sting.</i>

01:21:16.754 --> 01:21:17.948
That's a good movie.

01:21:18.055 --> 01:21:19.682
But I don't care,

01:21:20.157 --> 01:21:22.955
'cause in this moment,
doing what I love,

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.960
I know I have already won.

01:21:25.062 --> 01:21:28.691
An honorable, albeit court-appointed,
friend once said to me,

01:21:28.799 --> 01:21:30.494
"Do what makes you happy."

01:21:30.601 --> 01:21:34.970
And nothing would make me happier
than to fight alongside you brave men.

01:21:35.906 --> 01:21:37.897
When the elders
speak of this day,

01:21:38.008 --> 01:21:40.442
they will speak of the courage
of Kiss-My-Anthia.

01:21:40.544 --> 01:21:42.136
Of the Spaceman.

01:21:43.781 --> 01:21:45.146
The Demon.

01:21:46.784 --> 01:21:48.274
The Starchild.

01:21:49.653 --> 01:21:51.416
And me, the Cat!

01:21:51.522 --> 01:21:54.389
So let us raise
our swords in victory,

01:21:54.491 --> 01:21:56.391
crank this shit up to 11,

01:21:56.493 --> 01:21:58.688
and let's rip this
realm a new asshole!

01:21:58.796 --> 01:21:59.785
Yeah!

01:21:59.897 --> 01:22:02.195
Yeah! What the fuck
are we talking about?

01:22:02.299 --> 01:22:06.395
May Xanthia and
Kiss-My-Anthia be allies.

01:22:06.503 --> 01:22:11.133
King Argotron be damned.
We fight with you.

01:22:11.241 --> 01:22:13.334
Thank you, friends.
Your honor is great.

01:22:13.443 --> 01:22:16.935
Come. Let us gingerly
touch our tips.

01:22:18.348 --> 01:22:20.617
Game on!

01:22:36.633 --> 01:22:37.861
Yeah!

01:22:46.777 --> 01:22:49.644
Once we pass this point,
there's no turning back.

01:22:49.746 --> 01:22:51.338
It's a fight
to the death!

01:22:51.448 --> 01:22:53.348
About time!
Let's rip this shit up!

01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:55.077
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:22:57.654 --> 01:23:00.214
Yeah. Oh, snap! No!

01:23:00.324 --> 01:23:01.916
Come on. No!

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:05.651
Augie, what the hell?
Your boys just killed me!

01:23:05.762 --> 01:23:09.391
Retreat! Go! Like the leopard!
Like the leopard!

01:23:11.368 --> 01:23:13.029
Oh, Saint Venise!

01:23:16.506 --> 01:23:18.201
<i>Et tu,</i> you two?

01:23:19.409 --> 01:23:20.808
What the hell's going on?

01:23:20.911 --> 01:23:23.505
They killed you, so you have to
die an honorable and noble death.

01:23:23.614 --> 01:23:25.548
Okay. I think I can do that.

01:23:35.025 --> 01:23:36.617
Not bad.
Blufgan.

01:23:36.727 --> 01:23:38.251
Kuzzik.

01:23:38.362 --> 01:23:40.057
Fulfill your
destiny, Blufgan.

01:23:40.163 --> 01:23:41.289
Yes.
Kill the king.

01:23:41.398 --> 01:23:42.592
I will.
Kill the king.

01:23:42.699 --> 01:23:43.825
I will, Kuzzik!

01:23:43.934 --> 01:23:45.265
Go. Go.

01:23:45.836 --> 01:23:47.701
Go. Go.

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:56.035
Take that, you
lily-livered coward!

01:23:57.681 --> 01:23:59.581
Hey.
Hey. Where the hell are you guys?

01:23:59.683 --> 01:24:01.173
I cannot stall any longer.

01:24:01.285 --> 01:24:03.583
I'm at Jefferson Park.
Look. I can't talk right now.

01:24:03.687 --> 01:24:06.451
I'm in the middle of
battling a Cacedonian.

01:24:06.556 --> 01:24:08.421
Beth, I gotta help Augie.
I gotta go.

01:24:08.525 --> 01:24:10.220
<i>Fucking Cacedonian ass.</i>

01:24:10.327 --> 01:24:13.262
What? Hello. What?

01:24:19.536 --> 01:24:20.764
Bitch!

01:24:20.871 --> 01:24:22.736
Retreat to the castle!

01:24:26.543 --> 01:24:28.807
Long live Xanthia!

01:24:42.192 --> 01:24:44.092
You lost an arm, honey!

01:24:46.763 --> 01:24:48.321
Nice one, dude.

01:24:48.999 --> 01:24:51.024
Hey, Esplen.
Thanks.

01:24:56.106 --> 01:24:58.574
Okay. See you.
See you.

01:25:01.244 --> 01:25:02.905
Die, coward!

01:25:03.013 --> 01:25:04.878
Cacedonia
is to rule forever!

01:25:06.783 --> 01:25:08.614
What a scene.

01:25:21.832 --> 01:25:24.562
Okay. We lost a man,
but we can still do this.

01:25:24.668 --> 01:25:27.193
It's not the manpower.
It's the power of the man.

01:25:27.337 --> 01:25:28.929
Shit, this kid really
jacks you up.

01:25:29.039 --> 01:25:30.768
I want you to go left
through these trees.

01:25:30.874 --> 01:25:32.000
His lackeys
are pretty strong,

01:25:32.109 --> 01:25:34.339
but Davith of Glencracken
is the one you want.

01:25:34.444 --> 01:25:36.605
He's the one built
like a brick shithouse.

01:25:38.482 --> 01:25:39.779
Leave it to us, Augie.

01:25:39.883 --> 01:25:41.680
Good luck, <i>mi amigos!</i>

01:25:43.353 --> 01:25:47.312
Thanks for doing this.
- I'm doing it for the kids, not for you.

01:25:59.636 --> 01:26:00.864
Come on.

01:26:08.178 --> 01:26:10.476
Feel the steel
of my hammer!

01:26:17.821 --> 01:26:20.255
Hey, hey! Okay! Okay!
I'm dead! I'm dead!

01:26:20.357 --> 01:26:22.484
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
It's fun though, right?

01:26:22.592 --> 01:26:24.423
It's a blast.
It's contagious. I know.

01:26:24.528 --> 01:26:26.120
Totally.
Come back next year.

01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:27.355
I will. Thanks. Okay.

01:26:27.464 --> 01:26:28.829
We need people.
Give me your e-mail.

01:26:37.407 --> 01:26:39.875
Dude, you saved my life.

01:26:39.976 --> 01:26:42.410
I did what any good
coworker would do.

01:26:42.512 --> 01:26:45.640
I honestly can't say
I would do the same for you.

01:26:45.749 --> 01:26:48.809
You would, Danny,
because you're my friend.

01:26:49.619 --> 01:26:51.644
I want to hear you say it.

01:26:52.556 --> 01:26:54.217
Come on.
Say it.

01:26:56.526 --> 01:26:57.857
I'm your friend.

01:26:58.795 --> 01:27:00.820
Will you hold me?
No.

01:27:00.931 --> 01:27:02.262
Kiss on the cheek?
No.

01:27:02.365 --> 01:27:04.765
Hug me. I don't want to
do any of that.

01:27:04.868 --> 01:27:08.031
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:27:08.138 --> 01:27:09.537
Aren't you dead yet?

01:27:09.639 --> 01:27:11.266
Very close, Starchild.

01:27:11.374 --> 01:27:12.966
The end is near.

01:27:19.382 --> 01:27:20.906
Sleep, friend.

01:27:22.886 --> 01:27:24.979
They can't hurt you now.

01:27:29.726 --> 01:27:32.194
Right in the ball
sack. Fuck.

01:27:33.697 --> 01:27:35.597
All right. I'm
gonna get a beer.

01:27:35.732 --> 01:27:37.661
Hold your ground!

01:27:38.435 --> 01:27:39.561
Enclose, stab.

01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:41.136
As you command.

01:27:41.238 --> 01:27:42.762
Yes, my lord.
North.

01:27:43.907 --> 01:27:46.137
Davith is gone.
Nice work.

01:27:46.243 --> 01:27:47.870
Where's Spaceman?

01:27:52.983 --> 01:27:55.281
I don't think there's many
warriors left, you know.

01:27:55.385 --> 01:27:56.579
If I could just get
him one-on-one,

01:27:56.686 --> 01:27:58.483
I swear I could take him.
I could take him down.

01:27:58.588 --> 01:28:01.489
Hold up, dude.
Methinks I have a plan.

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.793
Hey, King! King!

01:28:07.831 --> 01:28:09.856
It's that guy from
The Burger Hole.

01:28:09.966 --> 01:28:12.298
Oh, he seems
to be wounded.

01:28:12.402 --> 01:28:13.630
Shall I take him out, sire?

01:28:13.737 --> 01:28:16.205
Nay. This one is mine.

01:28:26.816 --> 01:28:30.081
Well! Well, well.

01:28:34.357 --> 01:28:38.123
Looks like thou art fell for
the oldest trick in the scroll.

01:28:50.974 --> 01:28:54.535
Now you will kneel
before the king.

01:28:54.644 --> 01:28:58.080
Oh, drag. I really wanted to
win that pointy little hat.

01:28:58.181 --> 01:29:01.446
It's a crown!

01:29:09.392 --> 01:29:11.087
Cacedonia!

01:29:13.296 --> 01:29:14.354
You!

01:29:16.566 --> 01:29:17.692
Shit.

01:29:23.306 --> 01:29:26.139
Argotron. Face me,
if ye be brave enough.

01:29:26.243 --> 01:29:28.370
Didn't I teach you
a lesson the last time?

01:29:28.478 --> 01:29:31.936
I think you're afraid
I'm gonna kill you again.

01:29:33.583 --> 01:29:35.551
Go get them, Augie!

01:29:35.652 --> 01:29:37.984
You shut up, whore!
My mom is not a whore!

01:29:38.088 --> 01:29:39.487
Yes, she is!

01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:48.830
He could actually win.
It's anyone's game.

01:29:48.932 --> 01:29:50.126
Go, Blufgan!

01:29:50.233 --> 01:29:51.666
Yo, Augie! Fuck
his shit up, man!

01:30:11.755 --> 01:30:13.188
Screw it!

01:30:13.290 --> 01:30:14.314
Bad decision.

01:30:14.424 --> 01:30:16.153
No, it's a good decision.

01:30:21.398 --> 01:30:22.797
Oh, shit!

01:30:31.341 --> 01:30:33.434
It's okay.
I don't need it.

01:30:43.086 --> 01:30:44.178
Hey!

01:30:45.055 --> 01:30:46.784
Please. No.

01:31:13.783 --> 01:31:15.114
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:31:15.218 --> 01:31:16.310
That's what
I'm talking about!

01:31:16.419 --> 01:31:17.511
Yes!

01:31:19.089 --> 01:31:21.114
The gods have
played a coup.

01:31:21.224 --> 01:31:24.216
Blufgan is the last man
standing of them all!

01:31:25.428 --> 01:31:29.194
All hail King Blufgan!

01:31:29.933 --> 01:31:31.924
Hail, Blufgan!

01:31:35.405 --> 01:31:36.838
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:31:50.653 --> 01:31:52.746
What? Esplen is still alive?

01:31:54.457 --> 01:31:55.446
Esplen!

01:31:55.558 --> 01:31:57.651
I was hiding in the
bushes the whole time.

01:31:57.761 --> 01:31:59.092
That's a pretty
smart strategy.

01:31:59.195 --> 01:32:02.028
Thanks.
Sorry I killed you.

01:32:02.132 --> 01:32:03.656
It's okay.

01:32:03.767 --> 01:32:07.828
All hail Queen Esplen
of Navalore!

01:32:08.138 --> 01:32:10.436
Hail, Esplen!

01:32:16.646 --> 01:32:20.446
Game end!

01:32:22.419 --> 01:32:26.552
One slice to the king's chest
and down like a sack of elderberries!

01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:30.683
You did good, Augie.

01:32:30.794 --> 01:32:32.386
I mean, a girl did beat you,

01:32:32.495 --> 01:32:35.055
but it's definitely not as
gay as I thought it would be.

01:32:35.165 --> 01:32:38.362
You were incredible.
Second place!

01:32:38.468 --> 01:32:41.232
That's like a silver medal. Kind of
makes you hungry for the gold, huh?

01:32:42.572 --> 01:32:46.167
No, but we...
Serious, we are very, very proud of you.

01:32:46.276 --> 01:32:48.938
Thanks for trying to
be nice, Mom. Jim.

01:33:02.759 --> 01:33:04.420
Hail, Esplen!

01:33:05.195 --> 01:33:06.457
Congratulations.

01:33:06.563 --> 01:33:07.791
I can't believe I won.

01:33:07.897 --> 01:33:10.127
When I killed you,
I was, like, "No way."

01:33:10.233 --> 01:33:13.202
Yeah, well, the crown looks
very good on you, very regal.

01:33:13.303 --> 01:33:15.601
Thanks.
I liked your whiskers.

01:33:15.705 --> 01:33:17.138
Thanks.
Was that eyeliner?

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.367
Yeah, I just drew them on.

01:33:19.476 --> 01:33:20.670
It looked good.

01:33:20.777 --> 01:33:23.143
Thanks.
I have two cats, so...

01:33:23.246 --> 01:33:25.942
Oh. Okay. Cool.

01:33:26.049 --> 01:33:27.573
So, Augie,

01:33:28.651 --> 01:33:32.451
now that I'm queen,
I was wondering if maybe

01:33:33.623 --> 01:33:35.250
you'd wanna be my king?

01:33:35.358 --> 01:33:37.952
Yeah. I'd love that.

01:33:39.395 --> 01:33:41.693
Should...
Should I kiss you now?

01:33:50.006 --> 01:33:51.371
Fuck, yeah.

01:33:57.814 --> 01:34:00.715
Do you know the
song <i>Beth?</i> By Kiss?

01:34:01.150 --> 01:34:03.380
You did a really good
thing tonight, Wheeler.

01:34:03.486 --> 01:34:04.783
Yeah. They'll probably
double our sentence

01:34:04.888 --> 01:34:06.378
for not showing up to the
hearing this afternoon.

01:34:06.489 --> 01:34:09.890
Well, listen. I got a long-standing
relationship with this judge,

01:34:09.993 --> 01:34:13.224
and I don't want to get too graphic,
but I used to suck his dick for drugs.

01:34:13.329 --> 01:34:14.853
Oh.
He got me my junk.

01:34:14.964 --> 01:34:18.229
Long story short, you
guys are not going to jail.

01:34:18.334 --> 01:34:20.734
Are you BSing me?
'Cause I know you're the best BSer.

01:34:20.837 --> 01:34:21.861
No, I'm being straight
with you, man.

01:34:23.237 --> 01:34:24.169
Shit. Thank you.

01:34:24.272 --> 01:34:25.239
Whoa! Okay.

01:34:25.373 --> 01:34:26.362
Thank you so much.
All right.

01:34:26.474 --> 01:34:28.066
Hey, what's going on here?

01:34:29.777 --> 01:34:32.302
So speaking of whatever you
guys were just talking about,

01:34:32.413 --> 01:34:36.907
I happen to know a really nice
Italian restaurant in Manhattan Beach,

01:34:37.018 --> 01:34:39.578
and I would love to take you
if you're interested.

01:34:39.687 --> 01:34:41.177
Sure, Martin.

01:34:41.355 --> 01:34:43.755
I just hope we're talking
pasta and not pussy.

01:34:43.858 --> 01:34:46.827
Well, I was talking about
two adults having some pasta,

01:34:46.928 --> 01:34:50.125
and, yes, I was kinda hoping
that it would lead to some pussy.

01:34:50.231 --> 01:34:52.096
call it out there.

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.758
I mean, what are we after here?
Okay.

01:34:53.868 --> 01:34:57.634
Quiet down! Quiet down!
Gather round, ye nobles!

01:35:13.369 --> 01:35:16.566
<i>Beth, I hear you calling</i>

01:35:16.673 --> 01:35:20.803
<i>But I can't come</i>
<i>home right now</i>

01:35:20.910 --> 01:35:24.437
<i>'Cause me and the</i>
<i>boys are slaying</i>

01:35:24.547 --> 01:35:28.745
<i>And we just can't</i>
<i>find the sound</i>

01:35:29.586 --> 01:35:31.816
<i>None of these lyrics</i>

01:35:32.989 --> 01:35:36.083
<i>Have anything to do</i>
<i>with what I want to say</i>
