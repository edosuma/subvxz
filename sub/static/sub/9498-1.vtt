00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:54.090 --> 00:56.650
Maine Tourist Office,
how can I help you today?

00:57.861 --> 01:00.989
Yes, ma'am, I can connect you
to the Alagash Hotel.

01:08.371 --> 01:11.602
Between us, it's awful busy
that time of year and...

01:11.775 --> 01:13.504
...the Pine Tree in Dawesport...

01:13.677 --> 01:16.942
...it's just a skip up the road
for hardly half the price.

01:20.383 --> 01:21.441
Me, ma'am?

01:21.518 --> 01:25.477
I guess I come up here to stay
going on five years now.

01:26.256 --> 01:29.692
I don't believe I could leave Maine
even if I wanted to.

01:31.561 --> 01:34.189
No, ma'am, there's nothing else
like it nowhere.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.664
When the sugar maples turn scarlet
and the hickories go all gold it's like...

01:43.907 --> 01:46.432
...seeing the colors of paradise
come back to you...

01:46.509 --> 01:48.670
...even if it don't last but a week.

01:52.983 --> 01:55.679
You're welcome. It's been
real nice talking to you.

01:56.052 --> 01:57.485
Have a nice day.

01:57.654 --> 02:00.919
"Like seeing the colors of paradise
come back to you. "

02:01.491 --> 02:03.789
Where you get that
shit from, Percy?

02:03.893 --> 02:07.021
All you seen of Maine
is the inside of this prison.

02:07.564 --> 02:10.499
Most people'd rather hear a good lie
over the truth any day.

02:10.667 --> 02:13.727
Now, you getting out.
You best watch that lying, girl.

02:18.842 --> 02:21.174
Maine Tourist Office,
how can I help you today?

04:45.889 --> 04:48.881
Don't say I told you, but I was there.

04:49.092 --> 04:51.151
And that's what she said, Sarah.

04:52.595 --> 04:54.392
Now, what's this?

05:08.178 --> 05:09.145
Shelby?

05:11.848 --> 05:13.315
I said my blue shirt...

05:13.383 --> 05:14.543
...needed washing.

05:15.185 --> 05:18.518
I did all the white ones, but there
wasn't enough for a colored load.

05:19.255 --> 05:23.214
I'm showing the quarry tomorrow, Shel,
I told you. I need the blue shirt.

05:58.294 --> 06:00.023
Warden Minton said he'd call.

06:00.663 --> 06:04.224
He called, all right. About someone
looking to start fresh here.

06:05.568 --> 06:08.093
Truth be told,
I didn't take him serious.

06:09.405 --> 06:12.238
Nothing much starts
in Gilead these days.

06:12.675 --> 06:13.869
But here you are.

06:14.477 --> 06:15.739
Yes, sir.

06:16.980 --> 06:19.471
Tell me why you chose Gilead.

06:21.417 --> 06:23.112
Something wrong
with this place?

06:23.486 --> 06:25.147
Oh, no, I wouldn't say that.

06:28.324 --> 06:31.760
<i>If you give any account to the
Indian legends, it was here...</i>

06:33.329 --> 06:34.591
Story goes...

06:34.764 --> 06:39.133
...when the gods heard how beautiful
the land was, they left heaven to see it.

06:41.804 --> 06:45.171
I mean, it does have more pegmatite
rock formations than...

06:45.341 --> 06:47.775
...just about any other county
in the country.

06:48.444 --> 06:49.604
Is that right?

06:50.613 --> 06:54.276
<i>Yes, sir. Had a caller once
wanted to know all about...</i>

06:54.350 --> 06:55.681
...stuff like that.

07:04.294 --> 07:07.024
You lost your last
waitress this winter.

07:07.363 --> 07:08.955
<i>With your hip and all...</i>

07:10.233 --> 07:13.464
Another body in here
ain't gonna cure my hip, Gar'.

07:15.872 --> 07:18.864
Hannah, it don't have
to be permanent, and...

07:19.042 --> 07:21.636
...you've got that empty
room upstairs.

07:23.246 --> 07:24.975
And you need the help.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.308
<i>And, Hannah...</i>

07:28.985 --> 07:31.146
You'd be doing me...

07:32.221 --> 07:33.483
...a big favor.

07:33.656 --> 07:35.749
I don't owe you no favors.

07:40.997 --> 07:43.397
Bathroom's at the end of the hall.

07:43.766 --> 07:47.827
There's hot water enough, but not
if you dawdle while you're washing.

07:48.338 --> 07:52.399
There's extra blankets and sheets
in the sideboard.

07:52.775 --> 07:55.005
I give you breakfast at 6:00.

07:55.178 --> 07:57.339
Work starts right at 6:30.

07:58.181 --> 08:01.082
Anything else you need to
know can wait till then.

08:01.284 --> 08:03.081
Lamp's on the right.

09:47.523 --> 09:50.014
Wood's gotta come
in for the stove.

09:50.193 --> 09:52.787
Leave the tending of the fire
to me for now.

09:53.463 --> 09:56.626
Water's gotta be set
to boil for the cereal.

09:56.899 --> 09:59.299
Greens gotta come up
from the root cellar.

09:59.635 --> 10:03.298
If there ain't a gallon of coffee
out there in 15 minutes...

10:03.473 --> 10:05.805
...I'll hear about it
for the whole day.

10:06.309 --> 10:07.799
You got that, have you?

10:07.977 --> 10:09.035
Yep.

10:09.979 --> 10:13.471
I don't allow no smoking
in the kitchen either.

10:15.818 --> 10:19.413
Will you get that hair out of
your face working around food?

10:25.428 --> 10:27.157
I ain't open yet, Effy.

10:27.330 --> 10:29.161
I know what time you open.

10:29.332 --> 10:32.665
Just come to see if there was something
you needed from the store.

10:32.835 --> 10:34.359
Well, I don't.

10:37.940 --> 10:40.067
And her name is Percy.

10:40.743 --> 10:41.710
You happy?

10:55.825 --> 10:58.919
Don't turn around.
She's coming right to his table.

11:00.963 --> 11:02.453
What can I bring for you?

11:02.532 --> 11:04.227
Hannah knows what I'm having.

11:05.034 --> 11:08.470
That one's been real popular today.
You want coffee with that?

11:09.539 --> 11:11.439
<i>She's going to
pour his coffee...</i>

11:11.541 --> 11:13.805
I saw her from the
store last night.

11:23.886 --> 11:25.979
What's she doing
here anyway?

11:26.122 --> 11:28.716
Don't know and don't care.

11:40.236 --> 11:41.498
She came in...

11:41.637 --> 11:44.504
...on the bus last night.
I saw her coming...

11:50.580 --> 11:51.808
<i>Say, Hannah...</i>

11:52.515 --> 11:53.914
Did I forget to mention...

11:53.983 --> 11:57.111
...I been in prison at Windham
for the last five years?

11:57.820 --> 12:00.482
And I only got sent to
solitary three times.

12:02.758 --> 12:03.952
Imagine that.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.062
Percy!

13:09.725 --> 13:11.488
'Evening to you, Hannah.

13:12.328 --> 13:14.421
Brought some supplies
back from Bethel.

13:14.497 --> 13:16.658
Got you a box of
new scrubbing pads.

13:16.832 --> 13:18.663
New scrubbing pads?

13:18.901 --> 13:21.233
I had no complaints
about the old ones.

13:23.005 --> 13:25.906
Talked to those fellows
about the quarry again.

13:26.108 --> 13:27.336
They'll come to...

13:27.510 --> 13:29.705
...look at it anytime now.

13:30.246 --> 13:33.181
Well, you let me know
when the rush starts.

13:33.416 --> 13:34.508
Percy.

13:37.620 --> 13:39.349
I'm Nahum Goddard.

13:39.522 --> 13:40.750
Hannah's my aunt.

13:40.923 --> 13:41.912
You'd be?

13:42.625 --> 13:44.252
Perchance Talbott.

13:44.427 --> 13:45.587
Percy'll do.

13:47.263 --> 13:50.198
I got that real-estate office
across the street.

13:50.533 --> 13:51.727
Where you come from?

13:52.635 --> 13:53.761
Ohio.

13:53.936 --> 13:55.426
Ohio?

13:56.372 --> 13:59.739
I had some clients from Ohio once.
They didn't sound like you.

14:00.943 --> 14:04.401
I wouldn't mind coming from
someplace else if that don't suit you.

14:09.218 --> 14:13.211
I sort of look after Hannah,
so you're apt to be seeing a lot of me.

15:03.439 --> 15:06.203
<i>How much do you
know about this girl?</i>

15:06.342 --> 15:08.333
You've met Henry Minton...

15:08.511 --> 15:10.604
...the warden up
there at Windham?

15:11.447 --> 15:13.847
Short and stout,
kind of balding?

15:14.116 --> 15:15.208
He called...

15:15.351 --> 15:18.252
...and asked if I could
lend her a hand.

15:18.721 --> 15:20.018
That's all it is.

15:20.222 --> 15:21.450
Just the same...

15:21.624 --> 15:24.525
...I think you should have
talked to me about this.

15:24.727 --> 15:27.628
Hannah's a grown woman,
she's got a mind of her own.

15:27.797 --> 15:29.355
She's getting on, Gar'.

15:29.532 --> 15:33.366
I'm not warm to the prospect
of a criminal living with her.

15:33.536 --> 15:36.403
Who do you suppose will
keep an eye on this girl?

15:37.239 --> 15:40.470
Well, if she's working
at the Spitfire...

15:40.643 --> 15:41.974
...who won't?

15:44.313 --> 15:47.248
Did you know we've got
more pegmatite formations...

15:47.383 --> 15:49.977
...around here than
any other county?

15:50.753 --> 15:51.879
Pegmatite.

15:52.755 --> 15:53.813
No.

15:55.491 --> 15:59.325
I just know we got about a million
ton of granite in that hole.

15:59.495 --> 16:01.486
It ain't gonna dig itself out.

16:11.006 --> 16:12.667
What's that you're reading?

16:16.178 --> 16:17.907
"Rosy-fingered Dawn...

16:18.013 --> 16:20.777
"... came upon the sleeping
sailors and they woke...

16:20.850 --> 16:23.011
"... to resume their long journey. "

16:23.853 --> 16:25.912
I don't think I know that one.

16:26.589 --> 16:28.420
It's a pretty old story.

16:31.794 --> 16:33.022
<i>My name is...</i>

16:33.429 --> 16:34.418
Joe.

16:36.298 --> 16:38.789
I was here when Hannah
set you to work.

16:38.934 --> 16:42.495
I'm just guessing, but I bet you already
heard mine more than once.

16:43.806 --> 16:45.034
Percy.

16:47.810 --> 16:48.708
I was...

16:48.777 --> 16:51.507
...thinking I might take a ride
to Millfield later on.

16:52.214 --> 16:54.546
<i>You're welcome
to come along if...</i>

16:55.317 --> 16:57.114
What they got in Millfield?

16:57.319 --> 16:59.378
Nothing much, really, just...

17:00.222 --> 17:02.053
...it's someplace besides Gilead.

17:03.058 --> 17:05.720
I don't know. I gotta finish
a letter to someone.

17:05.895 --> 17:07.829
<i>I could talk to Hannah if...</i>

17:07.963 --> 17:10.157
It's not like she owns
me or something.

17:11.634 --> 17:12.828
I know.

17:13.335 --> 17:14.632
I know that.

17:25.580 --> 17:28.414
I guess this place is starting
to push in on me some.

17:33.088 --> 17:34.077
All right.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.595
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:12.595 --> 18:14.893
Like I said, it ain't Gilead.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:14.893 --> 18:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:22.471 --> 18:24.803
- Hey, Joe.
- How're you doing?

18:27.643 --> 18:29.838
I think I want to stay
here for a minute.

18:31.814 --> 18:33.042
All right.

18:33.215 --> 18:36.707
That's fine. I could run in
and get something for us.

18:37.419 --> 18:38.477
Okay.

18:39.555 --> 18:40.920
I'll be right back.

18:48.364 --> 18:49.991
Where'd you find her?

18:52.668 --> 18:53.999
Come on, honey.

19:02.678 --> 19:04.077
Get off of me!

19:10.019 --> 19:12.180
- Come back here.
- What're you doing?

19:12.454 --> 19:14.820
She just wants to be alone.
Go back inside.

19:15.357 --> 19:16.517
Go on.

19:25.267 --> 19:28.100
Here you are. Will this kind
be okay for you?

19:28.270 --> 19:30.033
I wouldn't know the difference.

19:30.272 --> 19:31.967
<i>No, I guess...</i>

19:33.208 --> 19:36.200
You know, you sound like
you're from the South.

19:37.179 --> 19:38.271
Your accent.

19:38.547 --> 19:41.209
- Things ain't always like they sound.
- I know.

19:41.784 --> 19:44.912
Just about every place else
is South from here.

19:45.621 --> 19:48.283
Flatlanders.
That's what we call them.

19:49.491 --> 19:51.959
You still got family down
there anywhere?

19:52.728 --> 19:56.528
Make a list of all your damn questions
and I'll answer when I got the time.

20:00.903 --> 20:02.200
What's going on?

20:03.305 --> 20:05.136
Manslaughter, all right?

20:05.407 --> 20:06.999
That's why I was in Windham.

20:07.142 --> 20:09.736
Now you got something
to tell all your friends.

20:09.845 --> 20:11.403
You can take me back.

20:12.381 --> 20:13.370
Can we go?

20:16.085 --> 20:17.143
Sure.

21:33.996 --> 21:36.123
Don't touch me.
Just go get help.

21:36.298 --> 21:37.959
But don't touch me.

21:45.874 --> 21:48.035
- Don't touch me.
- I heard you, Hannah.

21:48.210 --> 21:50.701
Joe's bringing the
truck 'round back.

21:50.879 --> 21:53.973
- We'll get you to the hospital in Lewiston.
- Don't touch my leg.

21:54.149 --> 21:56.549
It's the only place
that's got a doctor.

21:56.685 --> 21:57.674
Stay away.

21:57.753 --> 21:59.914
You want to fight me, old woman?
Have at it.

21:59.988 --> 22:03.014
But come hell or high water
that's where you're gonna go.

22:03.091 --> 22:04.149
All right.

22:21.910 --> 22:23.502
<i>Don't take a parade...</i>

22:23.679 --> 22:25.271
...just to get me into bed.

22:25.347 --> 22:26.371
Easy, now.

22:26.515 --> 22:28.244
Shoo, both of you, huh?

22:28.584 --> 22:30.245
We've got it. Thank you.

22:30.419 --> 22:34.355
All this plaster on my leg,
I'm sure I ain't going anywhere.

22:38.360 --> 22:41.523
Now, you care to tell us
what happened here, Hannah?

22:42.197 --> 22:45.928
She didn't push me down the stairs,
if that's what you're thinking.

22:47.469 --> 22:51.462
I was climbing up on the chair
and my hip spasmed on me.

22:53.208 --> 22:56.109
Just the same,
I think it'd be best for...

22:56.278 --> 22:57.939
...Percy to go now.

22:59.548 --> 23:00.606
Go where?

23:05.954 --> 23:08.252
I guess I should probably get going.

23:10.292 --> 23:11.953
I'm heating some coffee.

23:12.127 --> 23:13.958
No, that's all right.

23:14.129 --> 23:16.563
My father will worry
if I don't show up...

23:16.632 --> 23:18.224
...around there pretty soon.

23:18.300 --> 23:21.792
Thanks for helping me get Hannah
into the hospital.

23:22.337 --> 23:24.305
You should be getting the thanks.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.299
You done all right for her, Percy.

23:31.914 --> 23:35.315
Look, I won't tell anyone
why you were at Windham...

23:35.651 --> 23:37.209
...if that's what you want.

23:40.255 --> 23:41.654
Time will tell.

23:43.659 --> 23:45.490
Yes, it will.

23:49.264 --> 23:50.424
Coffee's hot.

23:52.834 --> 23:55.132
We don't know the
first thing about her.

23:55.671 --> 23:59.971
So we just ship her back
to Henry Minton at the prison?

24:00.442 --> 24:03.809
That'll be a fine thank you
for her getting me to Lewiston.

24:04.179 --> 24:08.275
I'm going to need someone around here
until I'm back on my feet.

24:08.784 --> 24:10.547
Shelby can look
after the Grill...

24:10.619 --> 24:11.608
Shelby!

24:12.955 --> 24:16.516
You're always carping
on how numb she is...

24:16.591 --> 24:18.855
...so Shelby'll just
cure everything...

24:19.294 --> 24:20.522
...I'm sure.

24:22.030 --> 24:23.224
<i>Ever since Eli...</i>

24:24.633 --> 24:26.794
I'm responsible for
you now, Hannah.

24:28.203 --> 24:30.296
Well, that's queer...

24:30.539 --> 24:34.475
...'cause I don't recall asking you
or anyone else...

24:34.643 --> 24:37.373
...to take over my life for me.

24:37.813 --> 24:40.475
So until I forget my name...

24:40.983 --> 24:43.645
...or start drooling at the mouth...

24:43.819 --> 24:47.448
...I'll thank you to allow me
to make my own decisions.

24:48.557 --> 24:49.717
I won't be...

24:49.891 --> 24:51.722
...in this bed forever, you know.

24:52.661 --> 24:54.390
Until then...

24:54.663 --> 24:57.154
...Percy can manage things.

25:45.380 --> 25:46.540
Sorry.

25:52.621 --> 25:54.748
Hannah, I was going to head up.

25:54.956 --> 25:58.790
- Can I get you anything before I go?
- No, I'm fine.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.222
But...

26:00.395 --> 26:04.354
...Glacier and I both are
having trouble imagining...

26:04.433 --> 26:07.994
...just who exactly it was
taught you how to cook.

26:08.804 --> 26:11.967
I never really had much more
than fast food growing up...

26:12.140 --> 26:15.576
...and if any of that was really cooked,
you could've fooled me.

26:15.977 --> 26:17.842
I know I'm making a mess of it.

26:19.648 --> 26:22.310
If not for the food,
they'd find something else...

26:22.384 --> 26:23.874
...to complain about.

26:24.152 --> 26:25.244
Right.

26:25.754 --> 26:27.153
Good night, then.

26:27.489 --> 26:28.649
Percy?

26:28.824 --> 26:29.756
Percy?

26:31.927 --> 26:33.827
There might...

26:34.096 --> 26:36.656
...still be one thing
that needs doing.

26:37.833 --> 26:39.824
You'll find a canvas sack...

26:40.001 --> 26:41.332
...in the office.

26:42.003 --> 26:46.269
It needs to have these canned
goods put in it and then...

26:47.275 --> 26:49.766
...placed outside near that stump.

26:50.779 --> 26:53.976
Then you can go on to bed
and get your rest.

26:54.449 --> 26:56.940
Think you can just do that?

26:57.285 --> 26:58.775
I'll see to it.

27:02.958 --> 27:04.016
Not to worry.

27:08.864 --> 27:09.956
<i>Percy...</i>

27:11.199 --> 27:14.032
Make sure that the axe goes
in the stump...

27:14.369 --> 27:17.361
...before someone steps on it
and gets hurt.

27:18.039 --> 27:19.131
Sure.

28:05.754 --> 28:06.743
'Morning.

28:08.423 --> 28:09.515
'Morning.

28:15.263 --> 28:16.753
This is Molly.

28:17.432 --> 28:22.199
I'm afraid Nahum didn't think of all
the details when he asked me in here.

28:22.537 --> 28:24.767
I brought a playpen for her...

28:25.040 --> 28:27.270
...and she shouldn't
be any bother.

28:27.542 --> 28:28.873
Is that okay with you?

28:29.110 --> 28:32.375
Hell, it's gotta be a lot more
your place than mine.

28:32.547 --> 28:34.481
- Set her wherever you like.
- Thanks...

28:35.784 --> 28:37.115
...Percy.

28:40.555 --> 28:42.887
It'll just be a second.

28:43.625 --> 28:44.785
There we go.

28:46.228 --> 28:47.286
There we go.

29:15.156 --> 29:16.487
Bacon.

29:55.463 --> 29:56.930
Damn, this is good.

29:57.866 --> 29:59.857
It's nothing special.

30:00.201 --> 30:02.965
It's a far sight better than
when Hannah makes it.

30:03.705 --> 30:05.639
You just don't know any better.

30:05.807 --> 30:08.970
<i>Anything's gotta taste good
after eating food...</i>

30:11.146 --> 30:12.135
I'm...

30:12.547 --> 30:13.536
...sorry.

30:13.815 --> 30:15.715
I shouldn't have said anything.

30:15.884 --> 30:18.546
I didn't exactly make a secret
of where I've been.

30:19.654 --> 30:21.212
Not exactly.

30:28.730 --> 30:31.563
You saved my bacon
in here today, Shelby.

30:34.169 --> 30:36.831
After things got sorted out...

30:37.005 --> 30:39.496
...it went pretty good, didn't it?
- Yeah.

30:39.674 --> 30:42.040
You can say that twice
and mean it.

30:49.184 --> 30:50.913
I better get going.

30:51.252 --> 30:53.277
Nahum'll be waiting.

31:01.429 --> 31:02.862
Good night.

31:04.199 --> 31:05.530
Good night.

32:21.009 --> 32:22.271
Wait.

32:22.444 --> 32:23.843
Wait!

32:30.185 --> 32:32.278
I don't mean you no harm.

32:35.190 --> 32:39.286
I thought you might want something
different in the bag, that's all.

32:40.462 --> 32:43.795
I know what's it like
eating the same thing every day...

32:43.865 --> 32:46.095
...till you can't stand it no more.

32:47.469 --> 32:49.300
Would you like that maybe?

32:50.371 --> 32:53.135
Something different
in the bag next time?

32:58.146 --> 33:00.080
Okay, then, it's a deal.

33:00.148 --> 33:01.979
We'll try something new.

33:03.718 --> 33:05.208
Maybe next time...

33:05.553 --> 33:09.922
...we won't be so rushed, we'll have
a chance to chat. That'll be okay, right?

33:14.729 --> 33:16.663
Well, it's late, so...

33:16.998 --> 33:18.727
...I'll be getting back.

33:51.533 --> 33:52.761
Hi, Mom.

33:53.768 --> 33:55.531
Hi, sweetheart.

33:56.938 --> 33:58.929
You're right on time.

33:59.707 --> 34:01.937
Look over that, I'll be right back.

34:02.110 --> 34:04.237
What you got for me today?

34:06.214 --> 34:08.273
No lack of odd ducks around here.

34:08.449 --> 34:10.882
You can say that
twice and mean it.

34:11.052 --> 34:12.781
Put your napkin in your lap.

34:14.556 --> 34:16.353
<i>"For Sale" sign
in the window...</i>

34:16.724 --> 34:18.748
Is Hannah really selling
this place?

34:23.063 --> 34:25.089
Did I say something wrong?

34:25.632 --> 34:29.797
Meet me on the back porch.
We'll need more potatoes for supper.

34:32.739 --> 34:35.072
Sorry, I shouldn't be so nosy.

34:36.143 --> 34:37.406
No.

34:38.413 --> 34:40.643
It's not that, it's just...

34:43.083 --> 34:45.746
...I don't know if it's
right for me to say.

34:46.487 --> 34:49.786
But, I can't see how
it's wrong neither.

34:51.592 --> 34:52.753
You see...

34:54.929 --> 34:56.658
...Hannah had a son.

34:57.832 --> 34:59.163
Eli.

35:00.435 --> 35:02.266
And right from the first...

35:02.604 --> 35:05.664
...it was pretty clear he
was something special.

35:06.841 --> 35:08.775
Tall, strong...

35:09.611 --> 35:11.010
...sweet.

35:11.779 --> 35:14.612
All-state champ four
years running.

35:15.316 --> 35:19.082
Somehow it just seemed like
Eli brought out the best in this town...

35:19.187 --> 35:21.747
...like as long as he was here...

35:21.823 --> 35:24.815
...somehow everything would
turn out all right.

35:26.127 --> 35:28.118
Then the war in Vietnam came.

35:28.296 --> 35:29.957
Did he get drafted?

35:30.431 --> 35:31.830
Oh, no.
No.

35:35.536 --> 35:36.867
He enlisted.

35:38.873 --> 35:42.365
His dad, James, was sort of
a big hero in World War II.

35:42.543 --> 35:45.876
I guess that's why they named
this place the Spitfire.

35:46.147 --> 35:50.174
So, when it came Eli's turn to serve,
he was raring to go.

35:51.886 --> 35:53.649
I can still remember...

35:53.888 --> 35:56.686
...walking up the hill
to the bus stop...

35:56.891 --> 35:59.519
...with the whole
town to see him off.

36:03.064 --> 36:06.227
That was the last time
we ever saw Eli.

36:10.571 --> 36:14.166
Hannah never told me what
the official story was but...

36:14.509 --> 36:17.501
...after a few years
it was pretty clear...

36:18.346 --> 36:20.246
...he wasn't coming back.

36:23.217 --> 36:25.310
His dad, James,
took it real hard.

36:25.586 --> 36:28.077
I guess his heart just
gave out from it.

36:28.256 --> 36:31.350
Couple years after
James died, Hannah...

36:31.693 --> 36:34.025
...put the Grill up for sale...

36:34.195 --> 36:37.528
...and asked Nahum to see
if he couldn't find a buyer.

36:38.533 --> 36:39.761
That was almost...

36:40.101 --> 36:41.864
...ten years ago.

36:49.043 --> 36:50.203
You know...

36:50.378 --> 36:53.279
...if Hannah still wants
to sell this place...

36:53.448 --> 36:56.076
...she might try running one
of them essay contests.

36:56.718 --> 36:58.379
Contests?

36:58.553 --> 37:03.456
When I worked at the Tourist Office,
some folks had an inn they couldn't sell.

37:03.791 --> 37:06.123
They ran an essay contest
to raffle it off.

37:06.294 --> 37:09.889
They got more than they could
have sold that place for.

37:10.000 --> 37:10.298
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:10.298 --> 37:11.663
Sounds crazy, huh?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:11.663 --> 37:15.570
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:15.570 --> 37:16.730
Percy!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:16.730 --> 37:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:22.477 --> 37:23.739
What's wrong?

37:23.945 --> 37:26.243
We must be running
short of supplies now.

37:26.581 --> 37:27.707
Supplies?

37:28.316 --> 37:31.410
From the sound of it,
I thought your hair was on fire.

37:31.586 --> 37:33.076
Well, it ain't.

37:33.254 --> 37:37.486
Now, I want you to drive down
to the Discount Mart in Bethel.

37:37.759 --> 37:40.091
I got a list all made
out for you here.

37:40.428 --> 37:42.020
You can drive, can't you?

37:43.264 --> 37:46.825
I've driven some,
but you want me to go?

37:47.835 --> 37:51.965
It's warming up a little.
I thought you could use the fresh air.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.172
Besides, the way
your cooking's...

37:55.343 --> 37:58.608
...improved, I think it's high time
we give Shelby...

37:58.780 --> 38:00.941
...a turn in the kitchen, don't you?

38:02.550 --> 38:04.575
I'm sure she'd welcome
the chance.

38:04.952 --> 38:06.647
Here's the list.

38:07.021 --> 38:10.457
There's $300 here
in the drawer.

38:10.792 --> 38:12.350
The key to the truck.

38:14.729 --> 38:17.960
You won't have any trouble
finding your way back, will you?

38:18.032 --> 38:19.192
No, ma'am.

38:20.034 --> 38:21.126
All right.

38:27.308 --> 38:29.299
What do you think, Glacier?

39:02.009 --> 39:03.340
Hey, mister!

39:03.678 --> 39:05.009
You all right there?

39:07.915 --> 39:09.576
Hey, what y'all doing?

39:10.685 --> 39:11.845
Nothing.

39:14.188 --> 39:15.519
Y'all from Ohio?

39:15.923 --> 39:19.051
'Cause I'm from Ohio.
I'm from Akron.

39:44.919 --> 39:47.752
Is it starting to ache bad again now,
Hannah?

39:49.423 --> 39:54.122
Not as much as trying to figure out
what part of me is going to give out next.

39:54.262 --> 39:56.127
Now, Hannah, don't.

39:56.264 --> 39:58.528
Spare me your milksop, Shelby.

39:58.699 --> 40:02.032
It's not a question
of "if" anymore...

40:02.203 --> 40:04.763
...it's just a question of "when. "

40:06.440 --> 40:11.139
It's high time that Nahum got on the stick
and found me a buyer for this place.

40:11.379 --> 40:13.279
You can tell him
I said so too.

40:13.447 --> 40:15.210
I'll tell him, Hannah...

40:15.383 --> 40:18.784
...but with the real-estate market
being like it is...

40:18.953 --> 40:21.046
<i>...I don't know.
You might...</i>

40:21.222 --> 40:22.382
Might what?

40:24.458 --> 40:28.895
You might want to try one of those
essay contest things to raffle it off.

40:29.063 --> 40:33.056
Some folks in Center Lovell did
real well with an inn they had.

40:33.234 --> 40:35.930
Essay contest?
What kind of nonsense is that?

40:37.738 --> 40:38.966
Nothing.

40:39.674 --> 40:41.471
I was just talking.

41:28.789 --> 41:30.017
So...

41:30.191 --> 41:34.651
...how would one of them essay
contest things work anyway?

41:37.231 --> 41:39.426
You mean like the
one in Center Lovell?

41:40.234 --> 41:43.362
I don't know. You're the one
that brought it up.

41:46.307 --> 41:48.036
The way I heard it...

41:48.242 --> 41:53.077
...first they set a deadline date,
like three or four months from the start.

41:53.147 --> 41:54.580
Then they asked people...

41:54.648 --> 41:58.049
...to send $100 with an essay
saying why they wanted their inn.

41:58.386 --> 42:00.581
They promised if
they got at least...

42:00.888 --> 42:04.483
...2,500 essays by the time
the deadline date rolled around...

42:04.925 --> 42:08.588
...they'd pick the best essay and
give the inn to whoever wrote it.

42:08.662 --> 42:09.856
They got that many?

42:10.164 --> 42:11.825
Even more, I think.

42:11.899 --> 42:13.196
That'd be more...

42:13.267 --> 42:16.327
...than $250,000, wouldn't it?

42:18.706 --> 42:20.037
This is all legal?

42:20.574 --> 42:23.168
Must be if they did it already.

42:27.348 --> 42:30.681
Shelby, see to that pot.
It's about to boil over.

42:37.925 --> 42:41.861
Why don't you go on up to bed?
Shelby and I will finish up here.

42:44.932 --> 42:46.297
Good night, then.

42:47.101 --> 42:48.295
Good night.

42:54.608 --> 42:56.667
Did I do something wrong, Hannah?

43:02.716 --> 43:06.550
What do you really think
of this contest idea?

43:07.621 --> 43:09.054
I don't know.

43:09.223 --> 43:10.656
Maybe you'd better ask...

43:10.724 --> 43:13.625
...Nahum about it.
- When I want Nahum's opinion...

43:13.828 --> 43:16.956
...I'll ask him. Right now
I'm asking you.

43:17.131 --> 43:20.567
- You still got a mind, don't you?
- Yes, Hannah, I do.

43:20.734 --> 43:21.928
Well, then?

43:22.236 --> 43:23.328
Well, then...

43:23.471 --> 43:25.234
...I can't see that...

43:25.639 --> 43:28.130
...you stand to lose
anything by trying.

43:31.846 --> 43:34.246
That's what I've
been thinking too.

43:35.483 --> 43:40.352
'Course I can't imagine that there's
50 people who'd want this place.

43:40.488 --> 43:42.922
Let alone a thousand or more.

43:43.757 --> 43:46.487
But I suppose anything's possible.

43:48.929 --> 43:51.989
Do you think you could see
to all the details for me?

43:52.166 --> 43:53.360
I don't know.

43:53.434 --> 43:55.095
Well, yes or no, Shelby?

43:55.936 --> 43:57.267
Yes.

43:59.106 --> 44:00.437
All right...

44:02.009 --> 44:03.601
...then it's settled.

44:05.179 --> 44:09.946
But you make sure they know it's
for cash only. I don't want to fool with...

44:10.117 --> 44:12.017
...out-of-state checks on this.

44:12.186 --> 44:13.380
All right.

44:15.789 --> 44:16.687
All right.

44:25.032 --> 44:29.196
"Small diner that seats about 40
with house attached. "

44:29.403 --> 44:31.030
How's that sound?

44:31.305 --> 44:32.499
Awful, huh?

44:32.706 --> 44:37.609
It's okay, I guess. But if I gambled $100,
I'd want it to be for someplace...

44:38.412 --> 44:40.209
...you know, special.

44:40.981 --> 44:44.508
It's not just the Spitfire they'd be
getting. They'd get Gilead too.

44:46.053 --> 44:49.352
There's nothing very special
about Gilead that I can see.

44:50.224 --> 44:51.714
Maybe not.

44:53.928 --> 44:57.830
You could say there's enough country
around it to lose yourself in...

44:57.998 --> 45:01.161
...but not so many people
you'd ever feel lost.

45:01.669 --> 45:02.863
I don't know.

45:03.070 --> 45:04.731
No, no, I like that.

45:04.939 --> 45:06.372
Keep going.
What else?

45:09.843 --> 45:11.504
You could say...

45:11.745 --> 45:15.704
...it's a place with roots so deep,
nobody can tear them out from under you.

45:18.018 --> 45:22.284
And customers so loyal they'll keep
coming back even if your cooking stinks.

45:25.693 --> 45:27.684
Loyal customers.

45:28.529 --> 45:31.362
You know what else?
Nahum told me we got...

45:31.532 --> 45:35.491
...more pegmatite rock formations
than any other county in the country.

45:36.971 --> 45:38.302
Did he, now?

45:39.540 --> 45:41.371
But we can't put that.

45:41.875 --> 45:43.365
Oh, I know.

45:45.479 --> 45:48.209
Let's write something
about the Indian River.

45:48.382 --> 45:50.714
They've got all kinds
of history there.

45:51.318 --> 45:53.650
- Maine Tourist Office, can I help you?
- Jolene?

45:53.988 --> 45:56.286
- It's Percy.
- Percy?

45:56.490 --> 45:57.514
I got Percy.

45:58.225 --> 46:01.092
- How're you doing, girl?
- I'm all right.

46:01.395 --> 46:05.798
You remember that essay contest thing
we had all them calls about a while back?

46:06.300 --> 46:08.894
<i>- Yeah. - The woman who
owns the diner...</i>

46:09.069 --> 46:10.730
...she wants to try one.

46:10.804 --> 46:14.797
I hoped you and the girls could help
me out by calling some of the papers...

46:15.075 --> 46:16.804
<i>...to help me spread the word.</i>

46:17.011 --> 46:20.003
Tell me how you want it to read
and I'll make sure...

46:20.147 --> 46:23.639
...that by next month, the whole
damn country's heard about it.

46:23.817 --> 46:25.079
How's that?

46:25.152 --> 46:29.088
Bless you. You got a pen?
I want you to write this down.

46:29.757 --> 46:34.319
I want all the entries to go to
Hannah Ferguson, care of the Spitfire Grill.

46:34.528 --> 46:36.257
<i>That's in Gilead, Maine...</i>

47:18.706 --> 47:21.368
Hannah said you
was out for a walk.

47:23.477 --> 47:27.140
Getting some peace before the
dishes get to rattling in my head.

47:29.717 --> 47:31.582
You like the woods, do you?

47:32.986 --> 47:35.819
My mama said my people come
from the mountains.

47:36.223 --> 47:39.488
Closest I ever been was
a city park in Akron.

47:40.227 --> 47:42.092
You are from Ohio.

47:43.597 --> 47:45.963
When the coal mines in Kentucky
gave out...

47:46.166 --> 47:48.726
...my people went north
looking for work.

47:48.902 --> 47:52.338
Didn't do much good. We're still
just poor white trash there too.

47:52.506 --> 47:55.100
Had us our very own
slum and everything.

47:55.609 --> 47:59.511
I talk country, but the only hills
I've ever seen were in magazines.

48:00.013 --> 48:03.244
You ought to take a ride
out to my land sometime.

48:03.517 --> 48:07.248
We got trees out there
as far as the eye can see.

48:07.521 --> 48:08.613
Yeah?

48:09.022 --> 48:10.182
Oh, yeah.

48:17.931 --> 48:19.193
Percy!

48:20.267 --> 48:22.929
- What? - Come quick,
something's happened.

48:23.203 --> 48:24.932
Where are you pulling me?

48:25.873 --> 48:30.037
I got something to show you and I
wanted someplace extra private.

48:30.210 --> 48:31.643
What, in here?

48:32.146 --> 48:33.443
Don't worry.

48:33.647 --> 48:35.706
Nobody comes here anymore.

48:35.883 --> 48:39.216
Since the quarry closed we
got no money for a minister.

48:39.386 --> 48:43.288
If you want to go to church,
you gotta drive at least to Bethel.

48:44.792 --> 48:47.283
I'm the only one that comes now.

48:48.162 --> 48:49.288
Why?

48:51.064 --> 48:52.895
It's someplace when...

48:53.300 --> 48:55.894
...I need to be by myself where...

48:58.071 --> 48:59.902
...it's quiet.

49:01.742 --> 49:04.302
I've never told anyone
about this before...

49:05.179 --> 49:07.909
...but I won't mind if you
want to come here...

49:08.081 --> 49:09.981
...sometimes by yourself...

49:10.184 --> 49:11.310
...too.

49:19.927 --> 49:22.054
So what's this good
news you got?

49:24.264 --> 49:25.322
Look.

49:26.433 --> 49:29.197
"Restaurant Raffle.
Want the Spitfire Grill?

49:29.336 --> 49:30.928
"Cash Only. "

49:32.506 --> 49:33.939
New York.

49:34.208 --> 49:35.334
Chicago.

49:35.509 --> 49:37.101
San Francisco.

49:37.277 --> 49:38.938
We got an article in each one.

49:39.112 --> 49:41.012
Queen Jolene.

49:41.215 --> 49:44.343
You gotta bake her up something
real nice we can send her.

49:44.518 --> 49:46.008
You betcha.

49:48.288 --> 49:49.619
Gilead Realty.

49:50.858 --> 49:52.621
County Clerk's Office?

49:53.227 --> 49:55.957
Oh, yes, yes, I did call.

49:58.799 --> 49:59.731
Yeah.

49:59.867 --> 50:01.630
Perchance Talbott.

50:02.369 --> 50:03.461
Yes.

50:05.539 --> 50:07.973
And what was the conviction for?

50:13.981 --> 50:15.141
I see.

50:18.385 --> 50:19.545
I see.

50:19.987 --> 50:21.249
Thank you.

50:42.509 --> 50:43.999
You find us all right?

50:44.278 --> 50:45.506
- Yeah.
- Good.

50:52.920 --> 50:54.353
Dad, this is...

50:54.521 --> 50:56.989
...this is my friend, Percy Talbott.

50:57.357 --> 50:58.847
Percy, this is my father...

50:58.926 --> 51:00.018
...Aaron.

51:01.595 --> 51:04.029
I'm just going to
go grab my jacket.

51:10.103 --> 51:11.593
What you watching?

51:16.543 --> 51:20.707
I work at the Spitfire. You should
have Joe bring you by sometime.

51:20.881 --> 51:22.109
It's fun.

51:29.122 --> 51:31.056
- You all set?
- Sure.

51:33.060 --> 51:34.220
'Bye.

52:06.860 --> 52:08.418
Look at them all.

52:08.996 --> 52:11.931
If that ain't beautiful,
I don't know what is.

52:13.100 --> 52:14.158
Yeah.

52:15.602 --> 52:17.968
It's a shame that's all they are.

52:19.373 --> 52:22.433
About 80 years ago,
before anyone knew any better...

52:22.609 --> 52:24.668
...they clear-cut through here.

52:24.945 --> 52:26.310
Took down everything.

52:26.513 --> 52:28.674
This is the stuff you get back.

52:29.116 --> 52:30.515
It's no good for lumber.

52:30.684 --> 52:33.448
It's not even good enough
to pulp for paper.

52:34.955 --> 52:36.946
It's all just worthless.

52:40.127 --> 52:42.960
I don't now nothing
about trees, but...

52:43.463 --> 52:45.021
...if they was mine...

52:45.465 --> 52:48.525
...you couldn't drag me away
with a runaway train.

52:48.702 --> 52:51.466
No matter how worthless
people said it was.

53:02.549 --> 53:03.538
Just...

53:03.717 --> 53:05.651
...roll it out gentle.

53:06.319 --> 53:07.809
That's right.

53:08.555 --> 53:12.218
You can put some more flour
on the pin if you need to.

53:12.726 --> 53:17.561
Cut the butter in, just to pea size,
let the milk sit before you start.

53:18.331 --> 53:20.561
Take the eggs out first.

53:20.834 --> 53:23.428
I'll never be able to
do this on my own.

53:23.570 --> 53:25.060
Ah, you will too.

53:25.739 --> 53:29.004
The way to a man's heart is still
through his stomach.

53:29.176 --> 53:33.078
- At least somewhere in that vicinity.
- Who said I wanted a man?

53:33.246 --> 53:37.444
I guess it wasn't you that went
over to Joe Sperling's farm.

53:37.851 --> 53:40.081
Well, ain't you the busybody.

53:40.353 --> 53:43.015
You been taking gossip
lessons from Effy?

53:43.690 --> 53:48.593
I don't need Effy to see that Joe's got more
than a little thing for you, Miss Talbott.

53:49.529 --> 53:52.862
Right. That boy's just plain lonely,
that's all.

53:53.100 --> 53:58.037
Ever talked to his father? Haven't had
so many laughs since they locked me up.

53:59.773 --> 54:00.967
Serious.

54:01.108 --> 54:03.099
Well, whatever you say.

54:03.276 --> 54:05.870
It doesn't take an
Einstein to picture...

54:06.046 --> 54:09.482
...you and Joe juggling a
truckload of kids someday.

54:12.385 --> 54:13.716
What?

54:14.988 --> 54:17.479
Did I say something wrong?

54:25.799 --> 54:27.562
What is it, Percy?

54:39.312 --> 54:43.510
When I was reading up on this state,
I come across this story.

54:45.085 --> 54:50.022
There was this Indian squaw and she was
rowing a canoe with her baby in it.

54:52.025 --> 54:56.018
Couple sailors who were liquored up
caught sight of them on the river.

55:01.168 --> 55:03.796
They'd heard this story that...

55:04.437 --> 55:07.167
...Indian babies knew
how to swim from birth.

55:07.340 --> 55:10.104
So they decided to
test their theory out.

55:10.544 --> 55:12.205
They capsized the canoe.

55:14.781 --> 55:17.341
The baby went straight
to the bottom.

55:20.187 --> 55:23.122
The story didn't say what
happened to the mother.

55:23.690 --> 55:26.352
I figure it's probably
best if she just...

55:27.961 --> 55:29.690
...drowned too.

55:32.132 --> 55:33.690
Don't you think?

55:39.072 --> 55:42.303
I forgot, Hannah didn't want
me smoking in the kitchen.

55:44.377 --> 55:45.537
Percy.

56:51.544 --> 56:54.206
I guess you got that
food all right.

56:55.282 --> 56:59.378
Shelby sure can work magic
with flour and butter, can't she?

57:08.662 --> 57:10.000
My name's Percy Talbott.

57:10.000 --> 57:10.789
You're Watching 123Movies.to
My name's Percy Talbott.

57:10.789 --> 57:11.231
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:11.231 --> 57:13.392
Well, Percy, at least.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:13.392 --> 57:13.566
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:13.566 --> 57:17.161
Talbott ain't my real name,
belonged to my stepdaddy.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:17.161 --> 57:17.804
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:17.804 --> 57:22.000
Don't know who my real daddy was,
so I don't know what my name should be.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:22.000 --> 57:22.070
Don't know who my real daddy was,
so I don't know what my name should be.

57:22.409 --> 57:24.969
Maybe it weren't meant for me
to have one.

57:26.246 --> 57:27.406
What about you?

57:27.580 --> 57:28.979
You got a name?

57:31.418 --> 57:33.978
Maybe you don't have
a real name either.

57:34.754 --> 57:37.416
Still, it'd be nice to
call you something.

57:37.691 --> 57:41.684
The Indians had a story about a
magic giant who lived in the woods.

57:41.828 --> 57:45.423
Called him Gluskap,
'cause he looked out for them.

57:46.499 --> 57:48.694
Would that be a
good name for you?

57:53.606 --> 57:57.337
I can't imagine anyone
wanting to be called Gluskap.

58:00.280 --> 58:02.009
How about Johnny B?

58:02.949 --> 58:04.780
How'd that be for a name?

58:07.020 --> 58:09.011
Johnny B.
Never knew what hit him.

58:09.222 --> 58:12.714
Wouldn't surprise me none if something
like that happened to you.

58:15.862 --> 58:19.354
Unless you tell me something different,
that's what I'll call you.

58:20.533 --> 58:21.864
Johnny B.

58:30.810 --> 58:32.243
Johnny B!

58:32.979 --> 58:34.810
Johnny B., you there?

59:27.100 --> 59:28.863
Oh, Johnny B.

01:00:08.475 --> 01:00:09.635
Effy.

01:00:16.149 --> 01:00:18.140
A letter come for
you this morning.

01:00:18.918 --> 01:00:21.614
"Hannah Ferguson,
care of the Spitfire Grill. "

01:00:23.156 --> 01:00:25.147
Who do you know from Chicago?

01:00:25.358 --> 01:00:27.656
I'm sure I have no idea.

01:00:39.939 --> 01:00:41.497
$100.

01:00:47.447 --> 01:00:49.506
"Dear Mrs. Ferguson:

01:00:50.383 --> 01:00:54.877
"I saw the article about your contest
last night when I couldn't sleep.

01:00:54.954 --> 01:00:58.355
"I was sick of watching TV
so I picked up the paper.

01:00:58.958 --> 01:01:00.755
"The reason I can't sleep...

01:01:00.894 --> 01:01:04.125
"... is because my family
is falling apart.

01:01:05.398 --> 01:01:07.958
"My wife walked out last year...

01:01:08.301 --> 01:01:11.293
"... and left me with
our two high-school boys.

01:01:12.539 --> 01:01:15.975
"I don't think her leaving us
was all my fault...

01:01:16.042 --> 01:01:18.533
"... but they blame
me for it anyway.

01:01:20.313 --> 01:01:24.977
"The way they're acting now, if I don't do
something soon, they'll leave me too.

01:01:25.418 --> 01:01:29.218
"Maybe if I could take us all
to a place like yours in Gilead...

01:01:29.422 --> 01:01:31.049
"... that won't happen. "

01:01:39.832 --> 01:01:43.461
If they're all going to sound like that,
the hell with it.

01:01:46.573 --> 01:01:48.734
It's just the first one.

01:02:02.689 --> 01:02:04.657
Might work better if
you let me do it.

01:02:08.761 --> 01:02:10.319
Suppose it might.

01:02:12.932 --> 01:02:14.092
Here.

01:02:15.935 --> 01:02:18.096
Just don't press too hard.

01:02:32.452 --> 01:02:34.352
Still pretty tender in there?

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.953
Sore enough...

01:02:36.122 --> 01:02:40.525
...seeing as how the doctor keeps
saying how well I'm healing.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.130
You suppose if a wound
goes real deep...

01:02:50.703 --> 01:02:54.571
...the healing of it can hurt
almost as bad as what caused it?

01:02:58.211 --> 01:02:59.473
Might be.

01:03:10.556 --> 01:03:11.887
Detroit.

01:03:12.058 --> 01:03:13.286
New York.

01:03:13.559 --> 01:03:14.821
Kansas City.

01:03:14.994 --> 01:03:15.983
Boston.

01:03:16.162 --> 01:03:17.129
Memphis.

01:03:18.264 --> 01:03:21.358
As postmistress I've got a
legal right to know...

01:03:21.668 --> 01:03:25.570
...if the mail service is being used
for any irregular purpose.

01:03:25.638 --> 01:03:30.473
Will you tell me what goes on here
or do I have to open these myself?

01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:34.402
Not that it's any of
your business, Effy...

01:03:34.747 --> 01:03:38.239
...but I'm running a contest
to give away the Grill.

01:03:38.851 --> 01:03:40.011
A contest?

01:03:41.254 --> 01:03:43.518
What kind of contest is that?

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:46.354
Some kind of essay thing.

01:03:46.926 --> 01:03:49.952
You know Hannah, you don't know
what she could be up to.

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:54.022
Something about an essay or something.
$100 and a letter.

01:03:56.202 --> 01:03:59.262
Why would you even want
to try such a thing?

01:03:59.539 --> 01:04:01.769
Because no one else is buying.

01:04:02.542 --> 01:04:06.034
Where would my Aunt Hannah
get an idea like that?

01:04:08.548 --> 01:04:09.879
From me.

01:04:10.049 --> 01:04:11.448
Is that right?

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:19.551
I just hope this finally...

01:04:19.625 --> 01:04:22.958
...makes an old sour apple like you happy,
Hannah Ferguson.

01:04:36.909 --> 01:04:39.070
Holy Moses.

01:04:39.245 --> 01:04:40.803
Holy mackerel.

01:04:41.147 --> 01:04:43.081
Holy shit.

01:05:25.391 --> 01:05:26.881
"And I believe...

01:05:27.693 --> 01:05:31.026
"... in time, I could
expand the Spitfire...

01:05:31.297 --> 01:05:34.391
"... into a national chain
of restaurants. "

01:05:37.336 --> 01:05:39.201
Wait, now, listen to this one.

01:05:39.806 --> 01:05:43.765
"The reason I need to have your diner
is because that's where the aliens...

01:05:43.843 --> 01:05:48.075
<i>"... said to wait for them until
their ship comes to take me to... "</i>

01:05:50.316 --> 01:05:54.480
I can't even read that word,
but I'm guessing it's another planet.

01:05:55.221 --> 01:05:57.553
We got to send that
one back tomorrow.

01:05:57.723 --> 01:05:59.156
You read one, Hannah.

01:05:59.325 --> 01:06:00.883
All right, let's see.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.721
"Dear Hannah:

01:06:03.162 --> 01:06:06.427
"I've worked as a cook all my life...

01:06:06.666 --> 01:06:10.227
"... but hard as my husband and I
have worked...

01:06:10.403 --> 01:06:14.533
"... we've never had more than
two nickels to rub together.

01:06:14.907 --> 01:06:18.502
"We talked about having
our own little place someday...

01:06:18.744 --> 01:06:22.840
"... but that don't put bread on
the table. " That's for sure.

01:06:22.915 --> 01:06:25.850
"But now my husband's pretty sick.

01:06:27.086 --> 01:06:31.887
"The doctors say there's not much
more that they can do for him.

01:06:33.192 --> 01:06:37.185
"I'm sure there's a lot
of deserving people out there...

01:06:37.797 --> 01:06:39.788
"... but it would be a true blessing...

01:06:39.866 --> 01:06:43.029
"... if my husband could spend
what's left of his days...

01:06:43.703 --> 01:06:45.694
"... in a place like Gilead.

01:06:47.206 --> 01:06:50.767
"And I could have something
to sustain me when he's gone. "

01:06:55.615 --> 01:06:57.776
Maybe you should
hold onto that one.

01:07:01.721 --> 01:07:04.053
But I don't know
that we should...

01:07:04.790 --> 01:07:06.690
...pick someone out of pity.

01:07:07.126 --> 01:07:10.721
Well, what sort of person
would you want in here?

01:07:11.731 --> 01:07:13.221
I don't know.

01:07:13.566 --> 01:07:16.467
I've always thought it should be
someone younger.

01:07:16.636 --> 01:07:18.729
Someone more your
age than mine.

01:07:19.071 --> 01:07:20.060
Yeah?

01:07:20.406 --> 01:07:22.636
I figured it'd be
somebody like you.

01:07:23.943 --> 01:07:24.932
Me too.

01:07:30.816 --> 01:07:32.977
Whoever gets it...

01:07:33.152 --> 01:07:36.087
...will have their work
cut out for them...

01:07:36.255 --> 01:07:39.156
...trying to run this place
without you two.

01:07:43.996 --> 01:07:47.261
Have you thought what you'll do
with all this money now?

01:07:50.102 --> 01:07:55.005
I've been thinking about that since
the day I first put the Grill up for sale.

01:07:57.677 --> 01:07:59.440
Almost gave up hope.

01:08:01.948 --> 01:08:03.313
<i>But now...</i>

01:08:08.187 --> 01:08:09.518
Where's that jug?

01:08:09.689 --> 01:08:13.022
That applejack ain't doing us
any good in the bottle.

01:08:15.227 --> 01:08:17.491
Well, maybe half a glass.

01:08:18.197 --> 01:08:19.357
More.

01:08:22.201 --> 01:08:25.932
"If I were only one inch tall
I'd sleep in a slipper in the hall

01:08:26.072 --> 01:08:28.233
"And dream all night
of being tall"

01:08:28.307 --> 01:08:29.365
I'm back.

01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:33.042
- That's beautiful.
- And it's bedtime for you, sweets.

01:08:33.312 --> 01:08:35.212
You go on upstairs.

01:08:35.481 --> 01:08:37.573
- I'll be up in a minute.
- Okay.

01:08:52.331 --> 01:08:55.060
Looks like that contest
turned out all right.

01:08:55.234 --> 01:08:56.997
You must be real proud.

01:08:57.837 --> 01:09:00.670
I'm just glad for Hannah, that's all.

01:09:02.174 --> 01:09:03.835
But it was your idea.

01:09:04.076 --> 01:09:05.805
You deserve all the credit.

01:09:06.345 --> 01:09:08.404
We all worked on it together.

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:11.411
"We" means Percy, don't it?

01:09:11.584 --> 01:09:13.108
Well, she did her share.

01:09:13.586 --> 01:09:15.850
If anyone deserves thanking, it's her.

01:09:17.356 --> 01:09:21.725
Like mentioning Center Lovell while
you rubbed elbows in the kitchen.

01:09:23.095 --> 01:09:24.858
Well, what if she did?

01:09:25.031 --> 01:09:28.591
- What would be so terrible
about that? - Nothing.

01:09:28.768 --> 01:09:31.760
Except I knew this could never
have come from you.

01:09:34.774 --> 01:09:35.934
Why not?

01:09:36.942 --> 01:09:38.876
Why couldn't it have
come from me?

01:09:39.944 --> 01:09:42.913
'Cause you're just plain
not smart enough.

01:09:43.381 --> 01:09:44.609
That's why.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:58.963
If you want a clean shirt for yourself
for tomorrow, you can wash it yourself.

01:10:04.837 --> 01:10:06.600
<i>$100? For this place?</i>

01:10:06.806 --> 01:10:08.239
Not from me.

01:10:09.075 --> 01:10:11.066
I wouldn't take it for free.

01:10:12.745 --> 01:10:16.806
- Meeshack, you having the special today?
- Win something if I do?

01:10:16.982 --> 01:10:19.815
You gotta talk real pretty
and it'll cost you.

01:10:20.586 --> 01:10:22.349
All right. That's it.

01:10:23.255 --> 01:10:28.158
You're all so worked up about
this damn contest, be my guest...

01:10:28.594 --> 01:10:29.891
...jump right in.

01:10:30.262 --> 01:10:34.494
I got more reading here than I can
get through in a month of Sundays.

01:10:34.667 --> 01:10:36.464
Here, you take those.

01:10:36.535 --> 01:10:40.471
Effy, you're always reading
everyone's mail anyway.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.000
There.

01:10:42.441 --> 01:10:45.933
Meeshack, get back to me
with the best of this...

01:10:46.445 --> 01:10:48.436
...and then maybe, just maybe...

01:10:48.948 --> 01:10:51.644
...I might put up with
your smart-ass remarks.

01:12:36.388 --> 01:12:37.912
It answers one thing.

01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:39.382
What's that?

01:12:39.558 --> 01:12:42.721
What that Percy Talbott
really came here for.

01:12:45.464 --> 01:12:47.728
Ain't that dog died yet?

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:50.892
Shelby told me this whole thing
was her idea.

01:12:51.237 --> 01:12:55.230
Who's to say it's not a scam she
cooked up with her prison friends?

01:12:55.407 --> 01:12:58.740
If it'll make you feel any better,
I ran her records.

01:12:59.078 --> 01:13:01.444
There's no history of fraud or robbery.

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:04.708
She went to prison for manslaughter,
didn't she, Gar'?

01:13:04.984 --> 01:13:07.646
She paid her debt.
It's all said and done.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.114
There's got to be...

01:13:09.321 --> 01:13:11.789
...over $200,000 in Hannah's
safe by now.

01:13:11.857 --> 01:13:14.917
I hope I'm not the only one
to take that seriously.

01:13:20.266 --> 01:13:22.029
<i>Bring this meeting to order.</i>

01:13:22.167 --> 01:13:25.967
<i>I say it's Hannah's place
to do with as she pleases.</i>

01:13:27.673 --> 01:13:29.334
It'll ruin this place.

01:13:29.675 --> 01:13:31.165
Ruin it? From what?

01:13:31.343 --> 01:13:34.938
We got strangers crawling all over
us now and more coming every day.

01:13:40.286 --> 01:13:41.275
Hey.

01:13:45.958 --> 01:13:49.018
Their bark's a lot worse
than their bite.

01:13:49.695 --> 01:13:52.630
It's not like I came here
looking to start trouble.

01:13:53.365 --> 01:13:54.798
I know, but...

01:13:55.467 --> 01:13:58.959
...they're just not used to change.
It scares them.

01:13:59.204 --> 01:14:02.367
They'll shout it all out
and that'll be that.

01:14:03.309 --> 01:14:08.144
It's not like there's a law that you must
stand round and listen, is there?

01:14:10.983 --> 01:14:12.007
No.

01:14:13.385 --> 01:14:14.374
No.

01:14:15.821 --> 01:14:17.482
You want to get out of here?

01:14:19.325 --> 01:14:20.383
Sure.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:22.822
Yeah.

01:14:27.733 --> 01:14:29.667
What do you want to show me?

01:14:30.336 --> 01:14:31.200
These.

01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:33.898
- Your worthless trees?
- Maybe not anymore.

01:14:34.006 --> 01:14:36.338
I come upon this fellow out here.

01:14:36.508 --> 01:14:39.102
Turns out he's a research scientist.

01:14:39.345 --> 01:14:43.406
He said he looked all over the north
for this medical compound...

01:14:43.582 --> 01:14:46.608
...that can only be found
in the bark of trees.

01:14:47.186 --> 01:14:51.646
He figured it had to be in first-growth
trees but he couldn't find it.

01:14:52.491 --> 01:14:53.890
Then he saw these.

01:14:54.126 --> 01:14:58.062
Turns out this compound only happens
in stump growth like this...

01:14:58.230 --> 01:15:00.095
...when a tree tries
to regenerate itself.

01:15:00.165 --> 01:15:02.360
He said he could kick himself
for being so stupid.

01:15:02.434 --> 01:15:04.766
Hold on. This scientist fellow.

01:15:04.937 --> 01:15:06.268
What's he look like?

01:15:06.438 --> 01:15:08.770
A beard, sort of scrappy looking.

01:15:08.941 --> 01:15:12.206
- Driving a tan compact car?
- That's him.

01:15:12.544 --> 01:15:14.034
I seen that guy!

01:15:14.113 --> 01:15:16.946
Sniffing on trees
and chewing on their bark.

01:15:17.216 --> 01:15:21.482
- Thought he'd gone clear off his rocker.
- Lf he has, I'm going with him.

01:15:21.553 --> 01:15:23.783
He works for this
drug company.

01:15:24.123 --> 01:15:28.116
He wants to set up a project out here,
to harvest all the bark...

01:15:28.293 --> 01:15:30.056
...and stimulate more stump.

01:15:30.129 --> 01:15:31.562
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:15:35.067 --> 01:15:39.231
You know, it's all still in the
talking phase, of course...

01:15:39.405 --> 01:15:42.397
...but if the numbers they talked
about add up by half...

01:15:42.474 --> 01:15:44.806
...this could keep Gilead on the map.

01:15:45.577 --> 01:15:48.239
I'd call that real good
news for y'all.

01:15:48.313 --> 01:15:49.644
Real good news.

01:15:50.249 --> 01:15:51.580
Yeah, and...

01:15:52.651 --> 01:15:54.812
...maybe it could be
good news for us.

01:15:55.821 --> 01:15:57.152
Us?

01:15:59.258 --> 01:16:02.159
Yeah, now, don't ask
me to explain...

01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:07.490
...but that first night
when you come into town...

01:16:10.169 --> 01:16:14.003
...I had this feeling something
really good would happen...

01:16:16.175 --> 01:16:18.405
...and I'll be damned if...

01:16:18.944 --> 01:16:21.674
...it isn't sitting next
to me right now.

01:16:25.851 --> 01:16:28.684
- I don't know what crazy talk...
- No, listen.

01:16:30.022 --> 01:16:34.288
Listen, there's these trees here
and this land.

01:16:36.028 --> 01:16:37.996
You're a big part of that now.

01:16:39.698 --> 01:16:41.029
What do you mean?

01:16:42.634 --> 01:16:43.862
I don't know.

01:16:48.807 --> 01:16:51.139
How about you and
me getting married?

01:17:06.892 --> 01:17:08.154
What?

01:17:09.995 --> 01:17:12.486
You don't want to be
marrying me, Joe.

01:17:13.398 --> 01:17:15.662
I don't care what people think.

01:17:15.834 --> 01:17:17.392
It's not that.

01:17:19.338 --> 01:17:20.999
Well, what then?

01:17:24.176 --> 01:17:26.007
Will you want kids?

01:17:27.079 --> 01:17:28.671
Well, hell, yes.

01:17:28.847 --> 01:17:31.077
Hell, yes.
As many as you want.

01:17:32.184 --> 01:17:34.675
I can't have kids no more, Joe.

01:17:35.521 --> 01:17:36.681
<i>I...</i>

01:17:39.858 --> 01:17:41.758
We don't need to have...

01:17:42.094 --> 01:17:43.254
Please.

01:17:47.533 --> 01:17:51.060
There's a woman that's meant
to be your wife. I know it.

01:17:52.437 --> 01:17:54.200
It's just not me.

01:19:15.187 --> 01:19:16.620
Johnny B!

01:19:17.456 --> 01:19:18.684
You there?

01:19:52.391 --> 01:19:54.655
This is where you live, ain't it?

01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:07.060
Can I go in?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.344
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:12.344 --> 01:20:14.403
You know,
you should have told me.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:14.403 --> 01:20:15.447
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:15.447 --> 01:20:17.779
I'd have made you
something special.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:20.018
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:20.018 --> 01:20:22.009
I can bake a cake now.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:25.357 --> 01:20:27.848
Look at all your birds.

01:20:49.481 --> 01:20:50.709
You there?

01:21:17.743 --> 01:21:21.076
"There is a balm in Gilead

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:25.313
"To make the wounded whole

01:21:25.984 --> 01:21:29.317
"There is a balm in Gilead

01:21:30.155 --> 01:21:32.817
"To heal the worried soul

01:21:36.661 --> 01:21:40.757
"There is a balm in Gilead

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.933
"To make the wounded whole"

01:22:36.988 --> 01:22:39.718
Sorry I'm late. I went out,
lost track of time.

01:22:39.891 --> 01:22:41.222
Where you been?

01:22:41.827 --> 01:22:44.557
- I just went for a walk.
- What for?

01:22:45.564 --> 01:22:46.724
Nothing.

01:22:47.065 --> 01:22:50.330
You don't go sneaking off
at the crack of dawn for nothing.

01:22:50.502 --> 01:22:52.231
What were you out there for?

01:22:53.004 --> 01:22:54.528
Went for a walk with Joe.

01:22:54.606 --> 01:22:56.164
You liar!

01:22:56.241 --> 01:22:59.233
I just sent Joe off not
ten minutes ago.

01:22:59.578 --> 01:23:00.840
You were chasing him!

01:23:01.012 --> 01:23:02.274
It's not like that.

01:23:02.347 --> 01:23:03.371
Shut up!

01:23:03.915 --> 01:23:05.542
You just shut up!

01:23:05.617 --> 01:23:06.811
I should've known...

01:23:07.018 --> 01:23:09.919
...not to trust a piece of
lying trash like you.

01:23:10.188 --> 01:23:11.621
I've done nothing bad.

01:23:11.690 --> 01:23:14.215
You scared away
the only hope I had.

01:23:14.292 --> 01:23:15.122
Damn you!

01:23:15.193 --> 01:23:17.354
If you choose to live
with that hope...

01:23:17.429 --> 01:23:18.453
Shush!

01:23:18.697 --> 01:23:20.597
I lost my son!

01:23:21.099 --> 01:23:23.590
You think I chose that?

01:23:24.269 --> 01:23:26.669
You got no idea what that's like.

01:23:28.106 --> 01:23:30.199
How the hell would you know?

01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:33.803
You didn't kill your boy, did you?
You didn't let your baby die!

01:23:34.613 --> 01:23:36.274
You don't know nothing!

01:23:53.932 --> 01:23:56.400
<i>It's time you stopped
working at the Grill.</i>

01:23:58.003 --> 01:23:59.868
But I like working there.

01:24:00.505 --> 01:24:03.497
Anyway, this is really
about Percy, isn't it?

01:24:03.875 --> 01:24:06.366
You've had it out for that girl
since she got here.

01:24:07.178 --> 01:24:09.976
Because she has no business here.
Never did.

01:24:10.148 --> 01:24:12.878
She may have pulled the wool
over your eyes and Hannah's...

01:24:12.951 --> 01:24:15.613
...but others can see
what's going on.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.950
You think she helped fill that safe...

01:24:18.023 --> 01:24:19.820
...from the goodness
of her heart?

01:24:19.925 --> 01:24:21.324
For your information...

01:24:21.693 --> 01:24:24.890
...Percy is taking Hannah into
Lewiston tomorrow morning...

01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:27.123
...to put the money in the bank.

01:24:30.101 --> 01:24:31.125
Good God!

01:24:31.937 --> 01:24:33.165
What?

01:24:33.238 --> 01:24:34.796
Good God!

01:24:36.207 --> 01:24:39.540
Will it take finding Hannah
dead in a ditch...

01:24:39.711 --> 01:24:41.702
...for you to see the truth?

01:24:41.813 --> 01:24:45.078
Don't you know that girl
went to prison for murder?

01:24:47.819 --> 01:24:51.550
Her coming here has been
a godsend for Hannah.

01:24:51.723 --> 01:24:53.054
And for me.

01:24:53.258 --> 01:24:55.488
That's the reason
you can't stand her.

01:24:55.994 --> 01:24:57.552
You best watch your words.

01:24:58.063 --> 01:25:01.157
No, I won't watch my words.

01:25:01.833 --> 01:25:04.495
Why should I watch my words?

01:25:05.937 --> 01:25:09.839
You have got that same chip
on your shoulder now...

01:25:10.008 --> 01:25:11.976
...that you did when Eli was alive.

01:25:12.744 --> 01:25:14.837
The whole town
looked up to him...

01:25:14.913 --> 01:25:17.939
...and now that anybody sees
that same thing in Percy...

01:25:18.016 --> 01:25:20.507
...you hate her for it
the same way you hated him.

01:25:20.852 --> 01:25:24.253
But she is doing something
that you could never do.

01:25:24.589 --> 01:25:27.683
You are just plain
jealous of that girl.

01:25:29.628 --> 01:25:30.788
God.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.617
Gary!

01:28:18.363 --> 01:28:19.523
Okay.

01:28:24.702 --> 01:28:25.760
'Morning.

01:28:27.872 --> 01:28:29.430
What's wrong?

01:28:30.141 --> 01:28:31.233
It's gone.

01:28:33.244 --> 01:28:36.509
I went to get it out of the safe,
it's all gone.

01:28:37.215 --> 01:28:38.477
Where's Percy?

01:28:42.887 --> 01:28:43.911
No...

01:28:44.155 --> 01:28:45.554
...I checked her room.

01:28:46.724 --> 01:28:48.385
All around the house.

01:28:49.894 --> 01:28:51.452
She's gone too.

01:28:54.232 --> 01:28:56.860
No. I don't believe it.

01:28:58.369 --> 01:29:00.496
Something must have happened.

01:29:01.105 --> 01:29:02.595
What could have happened?

01:29:06.477 --> 01:29:08.468
Don't matter now
what happened.

01:29:08.813 --> 01:29:10.974
Just what's left to be done.

01:29:12.183 --> 01:29:13.582
What do you mean?

01:29:16.421 --> 01:29:18.321
What are you going to do?

01:29:19.924 --> 01:29:21.687
Where are you going?

01:29:27.599 --> 01:29:29.499
You here or there now?

01:29:31.002 --> 01:29:32.560
I came back to get the car.

01:29:33.538 --> 01:29:34.732
What goes on?

01:29:38.209 --> 01:29:42.646
Sorry to barge in so early, but Hannah
tells me the safe's been cleaned out...

01:29:42.747 --> 01:29:44.612
...and there's no sign of Percy.

01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:46.715
What's going on?

01:29:46.784 --> 01:29:49.344
None of your concern.
Go to your store.

01:29:49.587 --> 01:29:53.216
- I'll go when it suits me.
- I don't care what it looks like...

01:29:53.358 --> 01:29:54.950
...she didn't take that money.

01:29:55.026 --> 01:29:57.358
This is past you.
Stay out of it.

01:29:57.595 --> 01:29:59.324
No, not this time.

01:29:59.631 --> 01:30:01.462
So help me, Nahum...

01:30:01.633 --> 01:30:05.797
...if you condemn that girl without proof,
I'll quit you for good...

01:30:06.304 --> 01:30:07.532
...I swear.

01:30:18.483 --> 01:30:21.475
When I was out walking last night
I saw Percy...

01:30:22.887 --> 01:30:25.287
...bring a sack out on
the back porch...

01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:28.482
...then sit there like she
was waiting for someone.

01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:32.824
This morning the sack was gone and
I saw fresh tracks leading into the woods.

01:30:36.267 --> 01:30:38.326
Let's go back to the office.

01:30:38.503 --> 01:30:40.903
Looks like we need to
organize a search.

01:30:41.072 --> 01:30:45.270
Effy, will you watch Molly for a minute?
I'll go find Percy.

01:30:45.343 --> 01:30:46.605
Shelby!

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:52.174
Fred and Willy are
bringing their dogs...

01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:55.183
...and I got Tom coming
from Cumberland.

01:30:55.687 --> 01:30:59.123
If you could send me a couple of
troopers that'd be a great help.

01:31:01.259 --> 01:31:03.193
Great.
Thank you.

01:31:08.032 --> 01:31:09.124
Percy.

01:31:19.544 --> 01:31:24.447
I thought in someplace small like this
there might just be a chance, you know?

01:31:29.954 --> 01:31:33.321
But after what I done,
it don't matter where I go.

01:31:37.462 --> 01:31:39.453
What have you done, Percy?

01:31:44.902 --> 01:31:46.733
Well, I killed somebody.

01:31:55.246 --> 01:31:56.975
Mason Talbott.

01:31:59.851 --> 01:32:03.582
He was set on having me
not a week after he married my mama.

01:32:05.256 --> 01:32:06.689
I was nine.

01:32:09.594 --> 01:32:12.495
I guess she was too
afraid of losing him.

01:32:13.664 --> 01:32:16.656
She'd slap me and tell me,
"Shut up about it. "

01:32:22.106 --> 01:32:24.597
I was 16 when I got pregnant.

01:32:26.978 --> 01:32:29.310
And I hated what
he'd done to me...

01:32:29.881 --> 01:32:32.941
...but I found myself loving
that life inside me.

01:32:34.886 --> 01:32:36.513
Feeling it grow...

01:32:37.722 --> 01:32:39.451
...move, even.

01:32:41.492 --> 01:32:43.483
I got to calling it Johnny B...

01:32:43.795 --> 01:32:45.695
...for that song, you know?

01:32:45.963 --> 01:32:47.794
Johnny B. Goode.

01:32:48.466 --> 01:32:51.196
I figured that'd work
for a boy or a girl.

01:32:54.405 --> 01:32:58.808
And I swore to God that when that
baby came I would protect it...

01:32:59.410 --> 01:33:02.208
...from the likes of Mason,
no matter what.

01:33:04.816 --> 01:33:08.308
I figured since I was pregnant
he'd leave me alone.

01:33:09.654 --> 01:33:12.714
The more I stayed away from him,
the madder he got.

01:33:14.826 --> 01:33:16.054
One night...

01:33:16.127 --> 01:33:17.958
...he was drunk...

01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:20.620
...he come after me again.

01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:24.097
I tried to fight him...

01:33:27.572 --> 01:33:30.564
<i>...and he took to me
with his fist so bad...</i>

01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:40.740
<i>The baby...</i>

01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:47.758
I was in the hospital
for two weeks...

01:33:47.825 --> 01:33:50.817
...thinking about how
I hadn't kept my promise...

01:33:53.598 --> 01:33:56.795
...and I knew God would
never forgive me for that.

01:34:04.408 --> 01:34:06.876
Mason must've been afraid
of the police 'cause...

01:34:06.944 --> 01:34:09.936
...he took me from the hospital
before it was time.

01:34:11.115 --> 01:34:13.106
I don't know where we was going...

01:34:13.217 --> 01:34:16.311
...seemed I was in the back
of that car for days.

01:34:17.388 --> 01:34:21.950
We were in some motel somewhere.
He had a bottle, he was into it real good.

01:34:23.561 --> 01:34:25.552
He started talking...

01:34:26.497 --> 01:34:30.399
...started saying how it was right
that my baby died.

01:34:30.568 --> 01:34:33.059
It weren't never meant to be.

01:34:33.971 --> 01:34:37.338
All he needed was another
mouth to feed.

01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:42.244
And I don't think I said nothing.

01:34:44.815 --> 01:34:47.147
I recall seeing the
straight razor...

01:34:47.318 --> 01:34:50.583
...he had sitting on that
chest of drawers.

01:34:58.930 --> 01:35:01.091
And it was still too late.

01:35:06.170 --> 01:35:08.604
Turns out that motel
was in Maine.

01:35:19.784 --> 01:35:22.048
Frank, you heard we
had trouble here?

01:35:22.119 --> 01:35:23.484
Sure did.

01:35:24.355 --> 01:35:25.947
Shelby's car.

01:35:26.190 --> 01:35:28.852
- Wait a second, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:35:32.196 --> 01:35:33.458
Oh, Percy.

01:35:36.067 --> 01:35:38.297
I knew you didn't
take that money.

01:35:40.204 --> 01:35:41.569
What money?

01:35:43.307 --> 01:35:44.899
Hannah's money?

01:35:47.078 --> 01:35:49.410
I won't let you arrest her, Gar'.

01:35:49.547 --> 01:35:52.414
Shelby, calm down.
Nobody's getting arrested.

01:35:52.717 --> 01:35:54.651
I just want to talk
to Percy alone.

01:35:54.719 --> 01:35:57.119
The sooner you let it go,
the sooner I find out...

01:35:57.388 --> 01:35:59.356
...what's really going
on around here.

01:35:59.490 --> 01:36:01.287
Would you come with me, please?

01:36:04.895 --> 01:36:08.956
Just go and answer their questions
and everything will be all right.

01:36:10.167 --> 01:36:11.498
I promise.

01:36:13.971 --> 01:36:16.269
She hasn't run off
with anything.

01:36:16.907 --> 01:36:19.137
She was over there
in that church...

01:36:19.343 --> 01:36:23.143
...damning herself for a past
that would've killed you or me.

01:36:24.048 --> 01:36:26.846
You can't turn your back on
that girl for no reason.

01:36:26.917 --> 01:36:28.612
What happened here?

01:36:29.287 --> 01:36:30.845
We had a fight.

01:36:31.622 --> 01:36:33.180
I slapped her.

01:36:33.624 --> 01:36:34.784
Why?

01:36:35.092 --> 01:36:37.617
What could she have done
to bring on that?

01:36:37.695 --> 01:36:39.856
Stop it!
Just stop it!

01:36:40.064 --> 01:36:42.089
- You've got no right.
- You stop it!

01:36:42.166 --> 01:36:45.602
- You've got no right.
- That's all I'll say about it.

01:36:46.404 --> 01:36:48.395
The money is gone.

01:36:49.807 --> 01:36:51.798
It's out of my hands.

01:37:07.725 --> 01:37:11.252
When Percy told what happened to her,
there was a child?

01:37:15.733 --> 01:37:16.995
Yes.

01:37:23.908 --> 01:37:25.170
Mr. Boggs, Meeshack.

01:37:27.178 --> 01:37:29.646
I got a crazy message from Shelby.
What's going on?

01:37:29.714 --> 01:37:33.445
The Talbott girl gave Hannah's
money to a partner in the woods.

01:37:33.918 --> 01:37:36.045
We're splitting up
to go after them.

01:37:37.621 --> 01:37:38.679
Shelby?

01:37:39.090 --> 01:37:41.957
What is all this about,
Percy having...

01:37:42.193 --> 01:37:44.559
...some partner in the woods?
- I don't know.

01:37:44.628 --> 01:37:48.689
Nahum saw her leaving a sack
out for someone last night.

01:37:48.866 --> 01:37:51.630
Wait. That's not who
they're running after?

01:37:51.769 --> 01:37:52.861
Yeah, it is.

01:37:53.137 --> 01:37:54.297
But no!

01:38:04.515 --> 01:38:06.881
Have they taken
Percy somewhere?

01:38:07.051 --> 01:38:11.545
I don't know. She was at Gary's before,
but I don't know where she is now.

01:38:18.896 --> 01:38:20.454
Where's Percy?

01:38:22.166 --> 01:38:24.327
- I need your help.
- I can't help you, woman.

01:38:24.802 --> 01:38:26.497
Now just leave me alone.

01:38:33.077 --> 01:38:34.908
It's happening again.

01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:38.574
I'm trying to save him and I can't.

01:38:52.196 --> 01:38:54.494
I tried everything I could...

01:38:54.832 --> 01:38:56.197
...to find him...

01:38:56.834 --> 01:39:01.635
...but short of taking the food I put out
for him, he'd never let me near him.

01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:04.373
See, I thought if...

01:39:04.442 --> 01:39:06.273
...if I sold the Grill...

01:39:06.444 --> 01:39:09.277
...that I could use that
money to get help.

01:39:09.513 --> 01:39:10.775
But you...

01:39:11.348 --> 01:39:13.578
...you've seen him, haven't you?

01:39:14.285 --> 01:39:17.015
- They think I gave him
the money? - Yes.

01:39:17.087 --> 01:39:18.486
They're going after him?

01:39:18.556 --> 01:39:21.923
Yes, and I'm so afraid
of what's going to happen.

01:39:24.028 --> 01:39:26.189
I know I could find him. I could.

01:39:26.363 --> 01:39:30.265
- But they ain't gonna let me go now.
- Yes, they will.

01:39:30.701 --> 01:39:33.864
- Are you on the River Road?
- She's leaving right now...

01:39:34.038 --> 01:39:37.030
...unless you shoot
me to stop her.

01:39:37.107 --> 01:39:38.665
Now, hold on here, Hannah.

01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:17.670
Johnny B!

01:40:37.301 --> 01:40:38.427
Run!

01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:41.804
They're coming after you!

01:40:42.873 --> 01:40:43.862
Run!

01:41:12.403 --> 01:41:13.700
You stop now.

01:42:28.145 --> 01:42:29.203
Eli!

01:43:14.692 --> 01:43:15.852
Lf...

01:43:16.093 --> 01:43:21.030
...anyone's got anything to say about
Percy, now would be the time to do it.

01:44:09.747 --> 01:44:11.578
I never knew...

01:44:12.249 --> 01:44:14.012
...Percy Talbott.

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:18.649
I only thought I did.

01:44:22.593 --> 01:44:25.721
I thought she was a stranger...

01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:29.330
...who could bring no
good to my aunt...

01:44:30.834 --> 01:44:32.324
...to my family...

01:44:33.170 --> 01:44:34.831
...to this town.

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:37.930
And I thought...

01:44:39.176 --> 01:44:41.542
...I knew her so well...

01:44:42.446 --> 01:44:43.970
...that I took that money...

01:44:44.782 --> 01:44:46.215
...out of the safe...

01:44:47.117 --> 01:44:49.051
...to keep her from stealing it.

01:44:51.688 --> 01:44:54.953
I thought I knew her so well...

01:44:55.859 --> 01:44:57.190
...and more...

01:44:58.562 --> 01:44:59.961
...than anyone...

01:45:00.798 --> 01:45:03.198
...I am responsible...

01:45:04.134 --> 01:45:05.761
...for her death.

01:45:14.812 --> 01:45:17.679
I thought I knew Percy Talbott...

01:45:19.650 --> 01:45:22.744
...but I was wrong
as wrong can be.

01:45:25.088 --> 01:45:27.318
I never knew Percy Talbott.

01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:59.580
You know today was...

01:46:01.024 --> 01:46:03.993
...the official end of the contest.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.161
Will you still go through with it?

01:46:16.039 --> 01:46:19.133
Seems only right to let
the Spitfire go now.

01:46:26.717 --> 01:46:28.582
Are you leaving Gilead?

01:46:31.321 --> 01:46:33.221
I don't know about that.

01:46:35.826 --> 01:46:39.125
This new tree business
coming to town...

01:46:39.396 --> 01:46:43.389
...maybe I'll open a hardware store
right across the street...

01:46:44.201 --> 01:46:46.328
...just to rankle Effy.

01:46:49.072 --> 01:46:51.973
Are you sure you don't want me
to stay with you?

01:46:53.243 --> 01:46:54.938
Just for a little while?

01:46:55.746 --> 01:46:57.407
I'll be all right.

01:47:05.789 --> 01:47:07.347
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:47:10.994 --> 01:47:13.155
You go on home to your girls.

01:47:38.322 --> 01:47:39.482
Glacier?

01:48:04.114 --> 01:48:05.206
Glacier?

01:48:23.667 --> 01:48:24.998
We're closed.

01:49:10.447 --> 01:49:11.778
Eli!

01:50:19.449 --> 01:50:21.610
Let's go see your
mom for a second.

01:50:23.053 --> 01:50:24.042
Fine.

01:50:24.187 --> 01:50:26.052
These beans look good.

01:50:32.963 --> 01:50:35.193
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:50:45.142 --> 01:50:46.632
<i>"Dear Mrs. Ferguson:</i>

01:50:46.977 --> 01:50:50.970

01:50:51.481 --> 01:50:55.474

but it's nowhere near $100.</i>

01:50:56.086 --> 01:50:59.249

the rest as I can.</i>

01:50:59.890 --> 01:51:02.017

01:51:03.493 --> 01:51:04.551

01:51:28.718 --> 01:51:30.515
- Welcome to Gilead.
- Thank you.

01:51:30.687 --> 01:51:34.123
- So good to be here.
- Everybody, this is Clare.

01:51:34.191 --> 01:51:36.625
The winner of the essay contest.

01:51:37.661 --> 01:51:40.824
- Do you want to see
your new Grill? - Yeah.

01:51:42.699 --> 01:51:44.394
Shelby, look, it's Clare.

01:51:44.467 --> 01:51:45.695
Hi, Clare.
