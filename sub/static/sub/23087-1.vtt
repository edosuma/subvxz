Hi Barkley.

01:11.338 --> 01:12.371
Hi.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.639
Hi baby.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.340
Good morning.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.842
Hi.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.585
[ringing]

01:26.654 --> 01:30.522
<i>[voice mail] Hi, this is
Victoria, leave a message.</i>

01:30.558 --> 01:32.858
Hey Vicky, it's your sister.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.127
Just a friendly reminder,
you and Heather,

01:35.162 --> 01:36.295
tree lighting ceremony.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.430
10 am sharp.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.036
Good morning, Mrs. Anderson.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.003
Mr. Sims.

01:45.039 --> 01:46.605
We'll be opening up
real soon.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.979
Morning, Tom.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.014
Are we all set to go?

01:55.049 --> 01:55.981
Yes.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.616
Oh, yes.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.084
So uh, who knows?

01:59.120 --> 02:00.986
Only my parents and Craig.

02:01.021 --> 02:03.222
I'm so excited I could
barely sleep last night.

02:03.257 --> 02:06.391
Amanda, when we have a
second we should-oh, later.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.726
Here we are,
reporting for duty.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.695
Oh, mom, dad.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.463
Thank you guys
for everything.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.276
I could never have pulled
this off without you.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.100
Now, I put Craig in charge
of Santa.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.214
And your sister told me
to tell you that she and Heather

02:17.238 --> 02:21.507
will be here at ten and to stop
calling to remind her.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.641
Is everything ok?

02:22.676 --> 02:24.143
Santa is ready when you are.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.611
Thank you, Craig.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.946
Oh, hey, that line up of people
outside is getting longer.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.948
Alright, let's do this.

02:39.994 --> 02:42.828
Sorry we're, what,
15 minutes late?

02:42.897 --> 02:45.130
22 minutes and 30 seconds.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.398
Heather, you look beautiful.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.767
Thanks, Aunt Amanda.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.502
Hi.

02:50.538 --> 02:54.473
So is there anything happening
with Craig?

02:54.508 --> 02:56.341
Uh, no. Nothing.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.644
I mean, not nothing.

02:58.712 --> 02:59.890
But it's not something,
either.

02:59.914 --> 03:02.414
It's just-I'm still
in the thinking phase.

03:02.449 --> 03:06.852
Oh, I think you're overthinking,
as always.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.354
[chuckles]

03:09.423 --> 03:11.223
Sweetie, it's gonna start.

03:11.258 --> 03:13.091
Welcome, everyone.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.697
Next year the museum will be
dedicating a new wing

03:18.732 --> 03:19.998
to honour our veterans.

03:20.034 --> 03:20.966
Oh.

03:21.001 --> 03:24.102
[applause]

03:24.138 --> 03:26.371
Now we have someone
very special

03:26.407 --> 03:28.874
who came from far, far away
to do us the honour

03:28.909 --> 03:30.175
of lighting our Christmas tree.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.310
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:31.345 --> 03:34.179
please put your hands together
for Santa!

03:34.215 --> 03:35.314
[applause]

03:35.349 --> 03:36.615
Ho, ho, ho!

03:36.650 --> 03:38.817
Ho, ho, ho!

03:38.886 --> 03:41.353
Ho, ho, ho!

03:43.090 --> 03:45.023
Daddy?

03:45.059 --> 03:46.792
Oh my god!

03:48.762 --> 03:50.495
Dean!

03:53.000 --> 03:54.533
Oh baby, you're home.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.903
Please welcome home Pinewood's
own Master Sergeant Dean Yates.

03:57.938 --> 04:04.643

<i>[on TV] It's only December 1st,</i>

04:18.659 --> 04:21.860

04:45.185 --> 04:46.663
This homecoming
sure took it to heart.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.986
Yes, sir.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.088
So, Sergeant, want to see
your x-rays?

04:50.124 --> 04:51.623
Yes, sir.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.632
God bless those
combat hospitals.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.800
Yep.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.435
Then they sent me to Germany
for a month.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.770
Just got here last night.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.705
We should have you out of
that cast pretty soon.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.340
Then you can go out dancing.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.908
[laughs]

05:09.977 --> 05:11.710
I'd rather get back
to my unit.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.979
Uh...

05:14.014 --> 05:16.214
You, uh, didn't fill out
the contact sheet.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.360
Are you staying here
on base?

05:17.384 --> 05:18.384
Uh, no.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.018
I- I figured I'd rent
a place in town.

05:20.054 --> 05:22.954
I could use a dose of civilian
life right now.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.773
[sighs]

05:59.626 --> 06:01.059
Amanda?

06:01.095 --> 06:02.327
I hope you realize how much

06:02.363 --> 06:05.564
I appreciate all you've done
for the museum.

06:05.632 --> 06:06.798
Yes, of course.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.000
I mean, this place,
it's a part of who I am.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.136
Where else do I get to spend
the day hanging out

06:11.171 --> 06:13.405
with my great
great-grandfather's milk wagon?

06:13.440 --> 06:15.907
Oh, and just wait until you see
my preliminary designs

06:15.943 --> 06:17.042
for the veteran's wing.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.177
That's the-the thing.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.178
What thing?

06:20.214 --> 06:22.647
I have to cut your hours.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.116
Even more than
you already have?

06:24.151 --> 06:26.084
Yes, I'm sorry, I really am.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.953
Tom, is this place in trouble?

06:28.021 --> 06:31.256
Oh, we just have to tighten
our belts.

06:31.325 --> 06:35.360
Amanda, if we were in any real
trouble I would tell you, ok?

06:35.429 --> 06:36.728
Ok.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.799
<i>[voice mail] You have
one saved message.</i>

07:13.834 --> 07:15.267

07:33.053 --> 07:33.718
Hello?

07:33.754 --> 07:34.386
Hello.

07:34.421 --> 07:35.086
Hey.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.455
Uh, Sergeant Mullins.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.323
Um, how can I help you?

07:38.358 --> 07:40.459
We spoke earlier
on the phone, uh,

07:40.494 --> 07:41.693
about the apartment for rent?

07:41.728 --> 07:43.128
Oh.

07:43.163 --> 07:46.465
Oh, yeah-I didn't-sorry,
I didn't realize you were-

07:46.500 --> 07:47.999
you said your name was Jim.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.367
Oh, it is.

07:49.403 --> 07:51.269
Uh, Master Sergeant
James Q. Mullins.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.238
It's just Jim.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.109
Amanda Edwards.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.244
Nice to meet you, Sergeant.

07:59.279 --> 08:02.047
Uh, just Jim.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.182
Hi just Jim.

08:04.218 --> 08:05.750
Uh, shall we?

08:05.786 --> 08:06.885
Yeah.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.720
The dog's name is Barkley.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.056
It's always good to have
a guard dog.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.325
Oh, no, he's a big baby.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.537
Although it does take him
a little while

08:14.561 --> 08:16.595
to warm up to strangers.

08:16.630 --> 08:20.866
Well, who needs a guard dog with
this high-tech security system?

08:20.901 --> 08:22.834
I know, right?

08:25.873 --> 08:27.606
Come on in.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.573
Do you mind if I just drop
my stuff here?

08:28.609 --> 08:29.441
Uh, yeah, sure.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.876
Here, let me...

08:30.911 --> 08:33.078
I'll show you where
the laundry is first.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.780
The washer and dryer is in here.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.317
Uh, the dryer has seen better
days so it may take a while

08:39.352 --> 08:41.986
to get your clothes dry.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.989
Wow.

08:45.459 --> 08:48.894
Indian Chief 1948, right?

08:48.929 --> 08:51.630
Actually it's a '47.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.331
It belongs to my husband.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.300
Oh. Ok.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.636
Uh, the apartment is around
this way.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.039
You ok?

09:01.074 --> 09:02.207
Yep.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.052
It's a little small, but-

09:14.087 --> 09:15.320
It's perfect. I'll take it.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.889
Oh, you want references.

09:17.958 --> 09:18.890
No, no.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.959
Your uniform is
reference enough.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.461
It's just you are
the first tenant

09:23.497 --> 09:25.297
so I don't really know
how to do this.

09:25.365 --> 09:28.867
So I guess a cheque for first
month's rent and a handshake?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.101
Alright.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.871
Thank you, Amanda.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.277
I never realized
how dark it is in here.

09:39.313 --> 09:41.157
Oh, I'm gonna brighten
this place up with some uh,

09:41.181 --> 09:43.748
Christmas lights
and decorations.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.383
I love Christmas.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.185
It's a magical time of year,
right?

09:47.220 --> 09:50.021
Um, Amanda Edwards?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.222
Yes.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.362
Thank you.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.632
What happened to your leg?

10:00.667 --> 10:04.169
Oh... hazards of the job.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.971
I don't want to talk about it.

10:08.542 --> 10:11.076
There's a shopping centre
down the street

10:11.144 --> 10:14.179
and if you need anything,
just knock.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.717
Thank you.

10:23.724 --> 10:24.322
Hey.

10:24.358 --> 10:25.423
Hi.

10:25.492 --> 10:26.603
Sorry I'm late, I got held
up in court.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.193
Did you win?

10:28.228 --> 10:29.327
Well...

10:29.363 --> 10:30.440
Of course you did.
You're Craig Fletcher.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.730
Yeah.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.065
Hey, Amanda, about the um,
hot water in the shower?

10:34.101 --> 10:37.102
Oh, yeah I'm sorry, it takes
a few minutes to heat up.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.103
I should have told you that.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.215
No, it's ok.
Just-just checking.

10:39.239 --> 10:39.871
How're you doing?

10:39.906 --> 10:40.839
Hey.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.173
I rented that apartment finally.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.475
Right.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.510
You know what?

10:45.579 --> 10:47.412
Uh, just give me a second
and I'll go change.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.079
Sure.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.714
Ok.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.049
You know what? Here.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.652
I'm gonna take the guitar case,
you take your bag,

10:53.687 --> 10:55.453
no negotiation.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.460
The judge won't go for it
but the client pays the bills

11:02.529 --> 11:04.663
so I'll keep trying.

11:05.932 --> 11:06.998
Hey.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.034
I know that look.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.068
Ninth grade.

11:09.136 --> 11:13.138
Right before every
geometry test.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.906
Tom cut my hours again.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.241
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.409
Who knows?

11:17.444 --> 11:18.921
Maybe soon I'll be out
of a job altogether.

11:18.945 --> 11:23.048
So that's why you have a strange
man living in your house?

11:23.116 --> 11:24.616
Craig.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.819
That apartment is not in my
house and Jim is not strange.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.689
How many references
did he give you?

11:30.724 --> 11:32.357
Amanda, you know nothing
about this guy.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.225
I know he's a Master Sergeant
in the army.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.293
Ok.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.462
But honestly you shouldn't
have to...

11:37.497 --> 11:38.463
look, if you need some money-

11:38.498 --> 11:40.265
No. No, thank you.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.811
I am not going to start
borrowing money.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.602
Not even from a really
good friend.

11:44.638 --> 11:45.638
Is that all we are?

11:45.672 --> 11:47.439
Just friends?

11:47.507 --> 11:49.307
[sighs]

11:49.342 --> 11:50.675
Amanda, look.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.777
No one can replace Rick, ok?

11:52.813 --> 11:54.479
We all miss him.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.548
And he would want you
to be happy.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.550
Don't you wanna be?

11:58.585 --> 12:01.319
I just need a little more time.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.420
Ok?

12:05.759 --> 12:06.691
Ok.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.093
Ok.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.612
[knocking]

12:28.415 --> 12:29.415
Hi.

12:29.483 --> 12:30.683
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

12:30.717 --> 12:31.850
Uh, no, no.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.351
Come on in.
It's cold.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.519
Thank you.

12:40.761 --> 12:41.593
Is everything ok?

12:41.661 --> 12:43.728
Is it the shower
or something?

12:43.764 --> 12:44.874
No, no, no, everything's
working just fine.

12:44.898 --> 12:49.100
I just-I um, I got
you something.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.102
I came up to say thank you
for the apartment

12:51.138 --> 12:53.705
and for making it all so easy.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.975
Uh... it's very nice.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.743
Thank you.

13:07.053 --> 13:10.188
That's my husband, Rick.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.223
It's been two years.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.430
I'm sorry for your loss.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.598
Good night.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.367
Night.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.891
[exhales]

14:22.362 --> 14:23.761
Tom?

14:27.500 --> 14:28.867
A passionate collector.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.301
I got us a very good price.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.437
Do you know how long it took
me to find that sleigh?

14:32.505 --> 14:33.505
I'm the curator here.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.806
And I'm the executive
director.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.507
I pay the bills,
we need the money.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.443
End of story.

14:45.619 --> 14:48.052
Cutting my hours
and selling stuff off?

14:48.088 --> 14:49.787
That's not the end
of the story, is it?

14:49.823 --> 14:51.289
Cutbacks.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.502
The town's allocation for
this place is taking a big hit.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.326
$30,000.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.028
I didn't wanna tell you.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.463
Why not?

14:58.531 --> 15:01.165
Because I know what this place
means to you.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.368
I've been trying to balance
things and find a solution

15:03.403 --> 15:05.536
hoping it wouldn't come
to this but...

15:05.605 --> 15:10.742
our history museum could
well become history.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.610
Well, there's gotta be something
we can do.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.746
Like what?

15:14.814 --> 15:17.348
We could raise some money,
for a community fund.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.851
How are we supposed
to do that?

15:19.920 --> 15:21.152
A fundraiser.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.553
A benefit.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.856
People in this town will not let
this place disappear.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.090
It's a part of their story.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.392
But there's not enough time.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.427
The cutbacks take effect
at the first of the year.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.361
It's December 3rd.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.030
There's plenty of time.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.531
Let's look.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.532
December 23rd.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.433
It's a Saturday.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.434
It's perfect.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.902
We'll do a Christmas benefit.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.004
People are always more
generous around the holidays.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.473
It's that Christmas spirit
and all that.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.642
We could make it
an annual event.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.978
How can you be so calm
and confident?

15:47.013 --> 15:49.747
Well, once an army wife,
always an army wife.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.416
We've never put on a fundraiser.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.851
What does it take to do that?

15:53.887 --> 15:57.722
I have no idea but we will
figure it out.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.228
I was told I could
find you here.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.096
Hey.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.230
Hi.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.432
I hope I'm not bothering you.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.434
No, not at all.

16:09.502 --> 16:10.535
What's going on?

16:10.570 --> 16:11.903
Is everything ok?

16:11.972 --> 16:13.705
I didn't know who else
to talk to.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.573
Oh, Lily, we're friends.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.475
You can talk to me
about anything.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.977
Is this about your husband?

16:19.045 --> 16:21.212
Yeah.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.047
Um... this letter.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.850
Some medal ceremony
for Mark.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.318
Silver star.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.853
Purple heart.

16:28.922 --> 16:30.521
Will you be there with me?

16:30.590 --> 16:31.823
I- I can't do this alone.

16:31.891 --> 16:32.790
Yes, of course.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.292
You're not alone.

16:34.361 --> 16:37.328
How can they hand out medals
when they haven't even recovered

16:37.364 --> 16:39.864
his body from the mission?

16:39.899 --> 16:41.099
Amanda, how do you do it?

16:41.134 --> 16:44.769
Deal with all of this
and not go crazy?

16:44.804 --> 16:46.471
One day at a time.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.639
Some days it feels
like three steps forward

16:48.675 --> 16:50.608
and two steps back.

I finished up some laundry so I
thought I'd lend a hand and-

What're you doing?

19:32.105 --> 19:34.038
I didn't mean to upset you.

19:34.073 --> 19:34.872
I apologize.

19:34.908 --> 19:35.640
No.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.874
No, no, no.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.076
No, I-I should be apologizing.

19:39.112 --> 19:40.645
And I wasn't upset.

19:40.713 --> 19:44.081
I don't know what I was.

19:44.117 --> 19:48.152
And it wasn't just seeing
you with the bike.

19:48.188 --> 19:51.189
There's a lot of other stuff,
too.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.423
Like what?

19:52.458 --> 19:54.158
The heritage museum
and community centre

19:54.227 --> 19:56.928
where I work might be closing.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.696
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.631
Yeah, me too.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.000
That building used to belong
to my grandparents.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.336
My grandfather
was the mayor.

20:05.371 --> 20:08.873
But it's more than that.

20:08.908 --> 20:12.877
It's a gathering place
for kids and seniors.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.178
Everyone.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.814
It's where the town
really comes together.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.049
So what're you gonna do?

20:18.117 --> 20:20.451
I'm gonna put on
a fundraiser.

20:20.486 --> 20:21.619
A benefit.

20:21.654 --> 20:25.289
As soon as I figure out
what that entails.

20:25.358 --> 20:28.159
And then I'm gonna make
a plan of action.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.962
Ok, well when you do that
I would like to help.

20:32.665 --> 20:33.631
Really?

20:33.666 --> 20:34.666
Yeah.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.933
Why?

20:35.969 --> 20:37.346
Because history matters
and community matters

20:37.370 --> 20:41.272
and it sounds like it's more
than just a building.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.912
Mmm.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.814
My mom used to make
the best hot chocolate.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.783
Christmas Eve, it was
our own little tradition.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.885
Except for she made it
with um, whipped cream

20:54.921 --> 20:56.320
and marshmallows.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.656
Well, we're all out of whipped
cream and marshmallows.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.325
I'll pick some up at
the store tomorrow.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.863
It sure is peaceful
and quiet here.

21:05.898 --> 21:08.866
That's because someone fixed
the squeaky gate.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.801
Oh.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.470
That must have been
one of Santa's elves.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.739
Oh, yes.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.141
Um, thank you, Santa's elf.

Thank you.

You know, your house is
the only one on the block

21:23.416 --> 21:25.850
that isn't decorated
for Christmas.

21:25.885 --> 21:32.590
I haven't been able to bring
myself to decorate ever since...

21:32.625 --> 21:34.792
You know, this is
gonna sound corny

21:34.861 --> 21:40.131
but I believe in the magic of
Christmas and how it can heal

21:40.166 --> 21:43.968
a broken heart or
a wounded spirit.

21:44.003 --> 21:48.039
I just don't have it in me
to believe anymore.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.241
I'm sorry about your loss.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.076
Your husband.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.016
Ow.

22:02.055 --> 22:03.521
Shouldn't you be using
your crutch?

22:03.556 --> 22:05.823
Ah, yeah, I think
I can manage.

22:05.858 --> 22:06.891
I see.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.093
You're a stubborn one.

22:09.128 --> 22:11.262
You know what I think?

22:11.297 --> 22:12.930
I think you're a
stubborn one, too.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.031
Mmm.

22:14.067 --> 22:15.866
Well, my dad calls it
"hard-headed".

22:15.902 --> 22:17.535
I'll bet he does.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.005
I should turn in.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.473
Thank you for
the hot chocolate.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.008
Yeah, of course.

22:24.077 --> 22:25.643
Good night.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.680
You know, I used to believe.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.817
In the magic of Christmas.

22:32.852 --> 22:36.020
I did.

22:36.055 --> 22:38.155
Good night.

22:38.191 --> 22:40.124
Good night, Amanda.

I'm making a to-do list.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.050
I have to come up with
a brilliant plan fast.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.520
Well, I've done fundraising
for Heather's school.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.555
All those field trips
to New York and D.C.

23:44.624 --> 23:45.734

23:45.758 --> 23:46.624
Thank you, Victoria.

23:46.659 --> 23:47.925
I really appreciate it.

23:53.166 --> 23:55.299
Ok, first thing's first.
Promotion.

23:55.334 --> 23:56.534
Spreading the word.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.668
You get on the phone,

23:57.703 --> 23:59.223
start making calls
and work your magic.

23:59.272 --> 24:00.504
I have magic?

24:00.573 --> 24:02.573
You do when you talk
about this town's heritage.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.442
Now you have to get
other people talking.

24:04.477 --> 24:07.611
Then you'll send out an email
blast to all our past visitors,

24:07.680 --> 24:10.247
contributors, reporters
and community leaders.

24:10.316 --> 24:11.115
Ok.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.616
What's in the email blast?

24:12.652 --> 24:13.417
Check your inbox.

24:13.453 --> 24:14.752
I already put one together.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.921
Who are you and what have
you done to my curator?

24:16.956 --> 24:19.957
This is gonna be an amazing
Christmas celebration.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.993
We're gonna have a pre-event
cocktail reception, gift bags-

24:24.730 --> 24:25.996
Just leave it to me.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.132
Then we'll have the Christmas
heritage auction

24:28.167 --> 24:29.300
which we'll do in two parts.

24:29.335 --> 24:30.768
First, the silent auction.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.404
Then we'll have a live auction
for bigger ticket items.

24:33.439 --> 24:34.817
We'll pull stuff out of
the deep storage

24:34.841 --> 24:36.207
that we very rarely display.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.142
And we'll get other items
donated as well.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.643
I'm impressed.

24:39.679 --> 24:42.079
More than impressed,
really, but...

Except I think it's gonna be
hard for me to ask people

25:40.806 --> 25:42.139
for money and donations.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.008
You do remember I offered
to help, right?

25:44.043 --> 25:45.142
Yes.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.722
Yes, I'm still trying
to figure out how.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.379
Thank you.

25:49.515 --> 25:52.082
I've gotta go get ready
for something special

25:52.118 --> 25:54.585
for a friend's... bye.

25:54.620 --> 25:55.719
Bye.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.121
Thank you.

26:39.665 --> 26:41.065
[car door closes]

27:17.269 --> 27:18.502
Here.

27:29.448 --> 27:30.448
Good morning.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.016
I'm General Frank Sazarro.

27:32.051 --> 27:35.452
I want to welcome you all as we
honour the exceptional heroism

27:35.488 --> 27:37.788
of Specialist Daekwon
Stevens,

27:37.823 --> 27:39.823
Specialist Mark Williams,

27:39.892 --> 27:42.126
<i>Sergeant First Class
Donald Paul,</i>

27:42.194 --> 27:44.228
<i>Staff Sergeant

27:44.263 --> 27:47.631
<i>and Master Sergeant

27:47.667 --> 27:49.578
<i>Having my own son in the
army I know the sacrifices</i>

27:49.602 --> 27:52.002
<i>made by each military family.</i>

27:52.071 --> 27:53.548
Could the wife of Specialist
Mark Williams

27:53.572 --> 27:55.305
please come forward?

27:55.374 --> 27:57.074
Come up with me, please?

27:57.109 --> 27:58.742
Yeah.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.414
<i>Attention to orders.</i>

28:05.151 --> 28:07.551
<i>The president of the United
States of America</i>

28:07.586 --> 28:11.488
<i>has awarded the purple heart

28:11.524 --> 28:15.125
<i>General George Washington

<i>August 7th, 1782, to

28:23.502 --> 28:24.768
Thank you.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.870
Thank you.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.029
Could the mother of Specialist
Daekwon Stevens

28:41.053 --> 28:42.986
please come forward?

28:45.958 --> 28:48.392
<i>Master Sergeant Mullins'
remarkable performance</i>

28:48.427 --> 28:51.295
<i>and selfless commitment to his

28:51.363 --> 28:54.098
<i>saved lives and reflects
the highest standard</i>

28:54.133 --> 28:56.834
<i>in military tradition.</i>

28:56.869 --> 28:58.802
So how's the broken leg?

28:58.838 --> 29:00.738
What broken leg, sir?

29:06.912 --> 29:08.178
Be proud of Mark.

29:08.214 --> 29:09.179
And yourself.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.180
Thank you.

29:10.216 --> 29:13.183
And remember:
one day at a time.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.551
Thanks for the card.

29:14.587 --> 29:15.786
It was so thoughtful.

29:15.821 --> 29:17.554
Daekwon really looked up
to you.

29:17.590 --> 29:18.689
Yeah.

29:18.724 --> 29:20.991
My brother told me
all about you.

29:21.026 --> 29:22.326
I'm sorry for your loss.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.061
Thank you.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.829
Here's my card, sergeant.

29:25.865 --> 29:28.165
Just in case you need anything.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.367
Thank you.

29:32.371 --> 29:33.437
General.

29:33.506 --> 29:35.506
Um, any word from
the recovery team?

29:35.541 --> 29:36.807
You know that train, Jim.

29:36.842 --> 29:38.642
Getting down that ravine
is almost impossible.

29:38.677 --> 29:40.744
Sir, Mark and Daekwon need
to come home.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.479
I said almost impossible.

29:42.515 --> 29:44.114
Nobody gets left behind.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.749
Not on my watch.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.218
Jim!

29:48.254 --> 29:51.955
I want you to meet my friend,
Lily Williams.

29:51.991 --> 29:52.756
Hello.

29:52.792 --> 29:53.924
Hi.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.359
Nice to meet you.

29:55.394 --> 29:58.796
I was hoping you could find
some time to talk with me.

29:58.864 --> 30:00.976
I mean, anything you could
tell me about Mark's last days,

30:01.000 --> 30:02.533
it would mean a lot.

30:02.568 --> 30:03.300
Yeah.

30:03.335 --> 30:04.067
Yeah, of course.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.235
I'll be in touch.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.337
Thank you.

30:07.373 --> 30:08.972
I'm gonna take off.

30:09.008 --> 30:09.740
I can go with you.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.241
No. Thanks.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.442
I think I need to be alone.

30:12.478 --> 30:13.777
Ok.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.045
Nice meeting you.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.647
You too.

30:20.519 --> 30:24.922
So, silver star, purple heart.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.624
When the MP's showed up at the
house this morning I thought-

30:27.693 --> 30:28.659
Thought what?

30:28.694 --> 30:30.427
That I was getting arrested?

30:30.496 --> 30:31.862
Something like that.

30:31.897 --> 30:33.764
I certainly didn't think
it was for this.

30:33.799 --> 30:38.068
Yeah, well, I didn't ask
for this.

30:38.103 --> 30:41.038
Hey, you wanna go grab
a bite to eat?

30:41.073 --> 30:42.372
Yeah.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.374
Ok.

30:50.316 --> 30:51.882
May I take your order?

30:51.917 --> 30:53.984
Uh, burger and a draught?

30:54.019 --> 30:55.586
You know what?
That sound great.

30:55.621 --> 30:56.353
Ok. Two, please.

30:56.388 --> 30:56.887
You bet.

30:56.922 --> 30:57.721
Thank you.

30:57.756 --> 30:59.056
Thank you.

31:01.393 --> 31:04.895
I had no idea that you were
Mark's team sergeant.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.296
Yeah.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.510
Yeah, I was transferred
to the unit a little while back.

31:08.534 --> 31:09.499
I really liked Mark
and Daekwon.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.001
They were good guys.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.703
Good soldiers.

31:12.738 --> 31:13.904
It's a small world,
isn't it?

31:13.973 --> 31:16.206
Because I didn't know
that you knew Mark.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.075
No, I didn't.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.043
I met Lily about nine
months ago.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.512
She was having a hard time
with his deployment.

31:22.548 --> 31:25.716
My mom suggested that
I speak to her.

31:25.751 --> 31:26.817
We're army wives.

31:26.852 --> 31:27.885
We stick together.

31:27.953 --> 31:29.052
Right.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.655
My mom is the poster girl
for army wives.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.124
What about-what about
your dad?

31:34.159 --> 31:35.392
Sergeant Major.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.427
Vietnam, middle east,
Grenada.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.429
The stories he tells.

31:39.498 --> 31:40.898
He's a big history buff.

31:40.966 --> 31:43.800
He's the reason why I have
a bachelor's degree in history.

31:43.836 --> 31:45.269
Ah.

31:45.304 --> 31:49.373
Well, my dad was
a corporal and um,

31:49.408 --> 31:51.275
he taught me to fix things.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.410
He would, uh, take a car
engine apart just

31:53.479 --> 31:55.523
for the challenge of putting
it back together, you know?

31:55.547 --> 31:57.826
He and I, we would do lots
of little things like that just-

31:57.850 --> 31:59.516
just the two of us,
you know?

31:59.585 --> 32:00.751
Mmmhmm.

32:00.786 --> 32:04.354
But he passed away about
five years ago.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.856
Oh, I'm sorry.

32:05.891 --> 32:07.724
It's ok.

32:09.495 --> 32:12.496
I got the feeling that you
weren't too comfortable

32:12.531 --> 32:15.098
talking to Lily about Mark.

32:15.134 --> 32:18.835
You know, if you want I can
come with you.

32:18.871 --> 32:21.872
No, it's-it's more complicated
than that.

32:34.820 --> 32:40.290
You know, Mark and Daekwon,
they deserve to come home.

32:40.326 --> 32:44.394
I am responsible
and I don't deserve that.

32:46.699 --> 32:49.499
Yes, you do.

32:58.043 --> 32:59.543
I love your bistro.

32:59.578 --> 33:02.479
I wish we could afford to have
you cater the event...

33:02.514 --> 33:03.880
Uh, come in.

33:03.916 --> 33:07.951
This is about the Christmas
heritage auction.

33:07.987 --> 33:12.255
You could donate 20 dining
coupons for the silent auction.

33:12.291 --> 33:15.158
How about I give you one.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.227
One coupon.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.663
Uh, yeah.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.932
That sounds great.

33:21.967 --> 33:23.100
Thank you.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.468
Merry Christmas.

33:26.071 --> 33:27.204
Wow.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.516
Who knew there were
so many ways to say no

33:28.540 --> 33:30.240
without actually saying "no"?

33:30.309 --> 33:33.010
But you know, I did manage
to get one dining coupon

33:33.045 --> 33:35.512
and I scored two bowling passes.

33:35.581 --> 33:36.747
Not bad.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.616
I mean, I asked for 20
and then ten and...

33:39.651 --> 33:40.895
well, and just like
everyone else

33:40.919 --> 33:42.853
I got hit with some excuse.

33:42.888 --> 33:44.187
Jim, what if I can't do this?

33:44.223 --> 33:45.355
Can I give you some advice?

33:45.391 --> 33:46.391
Yes, please.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.025
Don't ask questions,
make statements.

33:48.093 --> 33:49.593
Statements?

33:49.628 --> 33:50.805
Yeah. You ask questions, you
give them the power to say no.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.696
Or change the numbers
or the dynamics.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.464
Military training.

33:56.168 --> 34:00.337
Alright, Master Sergeant James
Q. Mullins, get out your phone.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.338
It's show time.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.673
Swag for the gift bags.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.242
Pepe's Pizza.

34:05.277 --> 34:08.045
50 coupons.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.246
Ok.

34:10.114 --> 34:11.815
Pepe, come on.
It's Christmas.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.150
Ok, here's what I need
from you.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.650
<i>50 coupons for a free
small pizza.</i>

34:14.686 --> 34:16.152
Woah, 50?

34:16.188 --> 34:18.621
I know you can do this and I
know you see the wisdom of it,

34:18.657 --> 34:20.056
not just because it's great PR

34:20.092 --> 34:21.425
for the best pizza place
in town

34:21.460 --> 34:23.260
but because
it's for a good cause.

34:23.328 --> 34:25.795
It is the best pizza in town
and a great cause, but-

34:25.831 --> 34:27.308
And this is gonna make
you feel so good,

34:27.331 --> 34:28.510
especially at this time of year,

34:28.534 --> 34:30.766
and do not forget this
is tax deductible.

34:30.803 --> 34:32.601
Ok, 50 coupons.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.071
Pepe, you're a gentleman.

34:34.106 --> 34:35.417
I'm gonna make sure every
soldier on the base

34:35.440 --> 34:36.739
knows about Pepe's Pizza.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.241
I personally guarantee that.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.543
Ok, bye.

34:39.578 --> 34:40.976
Wow.

34:41.013 --> 34:42.312
Uh, alright.

34:42.347 --> 34:44.581
You are now officially
in charge of gift bags.

34:44.616 --> 34:45.916
Ok.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.252
So how does it feel
without the cast?

34:49.288 --> 34:50.899
Uh, a little weird, I guess,
but I'll be fine.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.123
You need some physical
therapy.

34:52.157 --> 34:53.322
Of course.

34:53.358 --> 34:54.835
Um, how soon can I get back
into the field?

34:54.860 --> 34:55.792
What's the matter?

34:55.828 --> 34:57.494
You don't like being stateside?

34:57.529 --> 34:58.829
No, it's not that, I just-

34:58.897 --> 35:00.937
Sergeant. Your unit will
still be there when you get

35:00.966 --> 35:02.199
your strength back.

35:02.234 --> 35:03.633
You need some r&r first.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.080
And Christmas is just
two weeks away.

35:05.104 --> 35:08.071
Go. Have some fun.

35:08.807 --> 35:09.940
Sergeant.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.109
That's an order.

35:20.986 --> 35:21.618
Hey.

35:21.653 --> 35:22.686
Hey.

35:22.754 --> 35:27.924
Red wine and red roses.

35:27.960 --> 35:31.895
Well, delicious dinner,
delicious dessert as always.

35:31.930 --> 35:32.796
My pleasure.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.131
Thank you.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.299
Oh, do you think you could
ask your firm

35:36.335 --> 35:39.136
if they would wanna sponsor
the cocktail reception?

35:39.171 --> 35:40.637
Yeah, I can always ask.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.472
Great. I'd appreciate that.

35:42.541 --> 35:45.275
So how is your
fundraiser going?

35:45.310 --> 35:46.743
Uh... good.

35:46.812 --> 35:47.377
I think.

35:47.412 --> 35:48.111
Good.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.446
[laughs]

35:49.481 --> 35:52.816
Jim has been great
at getting people to say yes.

35:52.851 --> 35:53.583
Jim?

35:53.619 --> 35:54.584
My tenant.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.620
Sergeant Mullins.

35:55.687 --> 35:57.554
It's like people can't say
no to him.

35:57.589 --> 35:58.989
Army training.

35:59.024 --> 35:59.890
Right.

35:59.925 --> 36:00.957
I'm swamped.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.726
I still have so many emails
to send.

36:02.794 --> 36:05.195
Maybe we should
call it a night?

36:05.264 --> 36:06.264
Yeah.

36:06.298 --> 36:09.065
You know, I'll uh...
let me get this.

36:10.235 --> 36:11.601
Alright.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.417
Ok, so you'll have the seating
chart on the day, what else?

36:16.441 --> 36:17.474
Yeah.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.742
Just the uh,
permits for VIP's.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.076
[knocking]

36:20.112 --> 36:21.578
Come on in!

36:22.314 --> 36:23.380
Hey, Jim.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.247
Hi.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.749
Uh, this is my sister, Victoria.

36:25.784 --> 36:26.784
Hi.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.251
It's nice to finally meet you.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.386
You too.

36:29.454 --> 36:30.765
I've heard a lot about
Sergeant Mullins.

36:30.789 --> 36:31.922
My sister goes on and on.

36:31.957 --> 36:35.091
Yeah, and my sister exaggerates.

36:35.127 --> 36:36.526
Please sit, join us.

36:36.562 --> 36:37.761
Oh thanks.

Yeah.

thanks to you.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.972
Now we have to work on
the live auction items.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.552
You know, the 23rd is just
ten days away

36:50.576 --> 36:52.242
and I am doing my best
not to freak out.

36:52.277 --> 36:54.189
Ok, well I might be able to help
with something else.

36:54.213 --> 36:56.146
See, last night I spoke
with Daekwon's mother,

36:56.181 --> 36:57.514
Kendra, on the phone

36:57.549 --> 36:58.993
and you guys said you needed
a caterer, right?

36:59.017 --> 37:00.617
Yeah, but we can't afford
to pay one.

37:00.652 --> 37:01.818
No, no.

37:01.853 --> 37:02.931
Daekwon's mother runs
a catering company.

37:02.955 --> 37:04.120
She doesn't want any money

37:04.156 --> 37:05.400
'cause this town
meant a lot to her son

37:05.424 --> 37:07.224
so she's willing
to provide finger food

37:07.259 --> 37:09.359
and waiters and the works.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.161
That's wonderful.

37:11.196 --> 37:13.363
And Daekwon used to be part
of a quartet.

37:13.432 --> 37:14.432
A singing quartet?

37:14.466 --> 37:15.732
Yep. Acapella.

37:15.767 --> 37:19.402
And since... his brother
Antwon has taken his place

37:19.438 --> 37:22.872
and the quartet would like
to sing at the benefit.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.140
Wow.

37:24.176 --> 37:28.345
Anyway, I just came by
to tell you that, so...

37:28.413 --> 37:30.547
Thank you.

was a week before Christmas.

Ok.

Let's talk.

Sometimes when I look at Jim
I get butterflies in my stomach

42:53.038 --> 42:55.505
and it scares me.

42:55.540 --> 42:56.806
Why?

42:56.841 --> 42:57.941
Rick.

42:57.976 --> 43:00.009
I need to be sure.

You know, that if anything
were to happen with Jim,

43:02.047 --> 43:06.282
not that it will,
but if anything does,

43:06.351 --> 43:09.485
that Rick would be ok with it.

43:09.521 --> 43:10.887
What about you?

43:10.956 --> 43:14.023
Would you be ok with it?

43:14.092 --> 43:16.626
That's a-that's
a good question.

43:16.661 --> 43:17.694
I don't know.

43:17.729 --> 43:20.563
I really don't know.

43:20.599 --> 43:22.398
What's with the boxes?

43:22.434 --> 43:24.233
Uh, I am donating

43:24.302 --> 43:26.169
to the church's Christmas
clothing drive.

43:26.204 --> 43:28.304
I thought I'd drop by, we
could fill a few more boxes

43:28.340 --> 43:30.239
and then go together?

43:30.275 --> 43:31.474
Yeah, ok.

43:31.543 --> 43:33.576
I've got some clothes
I don't wear anymore.

43:33.612 --> 43:34.877
Ok.

43:34.913 --> 43:37.680
Oh, well I think it's time
to let this one go.

43:40.318 --> 43:41.784
It feels good, doesn't it?

43:41.820 --> 43:42.685
Yeah.

43:42.754 --> 43:45.955
Can feel like a fresh start.

43:48.059 --> 43:49.826
So what do you think?

43:49.861 --> 43:52.061
Some of his stuff, too?

43:52.130 --> 43:53.463
No.

43:57.469 --> 43:59.569
Look.

43:59.604 --> 44:01.604
Why don't we just start
with a shirt.

44:01.673 --> 44:02.705

44:02.741 --> 44:04.141
Maybe, like, you know,
a first step.

44:04.175 --> 44:06.142
What do you say?
Just one.

44:07.178 --> 44:08.411
One shirt.

44:08.446 --> 44:09.679
Ok.

44:14.786 --> 44:16.252

44:35.006 --> 44:36.406
It's just a shirt.

44:36.441 --> 44:37.885
Look, I think it's good that
you're questioning things,

44:37.909 --> 44:38.841
I really do.

44:38.910 --> 44:40.476
It's been two years.

44:40.545 --> 44:42.545
Maybe it's time to...
to let go, move on.

44:42.580 --> 44:45.381
Why are you here?

44:45.417 --> 44:47.328
Why all of a sudden are
you so interested in going

44:47.352 --> 44:48.685
through Rick's closet?

44:48.720 --> 44:50.186
Chemistry?

44:50.255 --> 44:52.221
I saw it between you and Jim.

44:52.257 --> 44:55.458
I saw that spark and I know
you felt it.

44:55.527 --> 44:56.859
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

44:56.895 --> 44:58.706
It doesn't take away anything
that you and Rick had.

44:58.730 --> 45:01.464
Nothing can take away that.

45:01.499 --> 45:04.667
But you-you, my sweet sister,
you are still here.

45:04.736 --> 45:08.404
Please just listen
to your heart.

45:09.441 --> 45:11.074
Ok.

45:11.109 --> 45:11.874
Look, I gotta go.

45:11.910 --> 45:12.875
Are you gonna be ok?

45:12.911 --> 45:15.011
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be fine.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.479
Ok.

45:19.417 --> 45:21.551
[knocking]

45:21.586 --> 45:22.318
Hi.

45:22.353 --> 45:24.620
Hi.

45:24.689 --> 45:25.521
Come on in.

45:25.557 --> 45:27.390
Thanks.

45:28.526 --> 45:30.126
Ok, uh, here's the thing.

45:30.161 --> 45:33.663
See, my-my doctor told me
that I... are you ok?

45:33.732 --> 45:35.131
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

45:35.200 --> 45:36.733
Nothing, you just seem
like you're-

45:36.768 --> 45:37.633
What?

45:37.669 --> 45:39.268
Confused?

45:41.673 --> 45:42.371
I'm sorry.

45:42.407 --> 45:43.706
I'm sorry.

45:43.775 --> 45:44.874
Don't be.

45:44.943 --> 45:45.408
Sometimes confusion can be
a good thing.

45:45.443 --> 45:46.242
It can be?

45:46.277 --> 45:47.744
Yeah.

45:47.779 --> 45:48.889
Sometimes when you're confused
it means you're searching

45:48.913 --> 45:50.191
for something and
If you're searching it

45:50.215 --> 45:51.392
usually means you'll
discover something.

45:51.416 --> 45:52.560
And that may not be what you
think you wanted

45:52.584 --> 45:54.517
but it may be what you need.

45:54.552 --> 45:58.454
You know, if I was a soldier
I'd want you as my sergeant.

45:58.490 --> 45:59.622
Um, sorry.

45:59.657 --> 46:01.097
I- I came by 'cause
I need your help.

46:01.126 --> 46:04.193
My doctor told me that
I need to have fun.

46:04.229 --> 46:04.927
Fun?

46:04.963 --> 46:06.729
Yeah. It was an order.

46:06.765 --> 46:10.867
Do you think, uh... do you think
you could help me with that?

46:12.604 --> 46:13.269
No peeking.

46:13.304 --> 46:14.270

01:12:38.221 --> 01:12:39.987
Maybe.

01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:44.258

$15,000, that's...
that's a lot of money.
