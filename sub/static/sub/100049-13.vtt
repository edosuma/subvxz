00:01.330 --> 00:03.620
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:03.620 --> 00:05.290
My son died,
and you're responsible.

00:05.290 --> 00:07.290
You take this
to your grave.

00:07.290 --> 00:09.290
We have to grieve him,
have a funeral.
No!

00:09.290 --> 00:10.620
Sam: Vivian. Please.

00:10.620 --> 00:12.250
I'll do anything
to meet him.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.290
Hey.
I know what you're doing.

00:14.290 --> 00:15.580
Lying about
being at your sister's.

00:15.580 --> 00:16.540
Delete this e-mail.

00:16.540 --> 00:17.830
No other kid

00:17.830 --> 00:19.040
is gonna replace
the one you lost.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.880
You're a better guy
than you think.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.830
What if I know something else
that'll help your case?

00:23.830 --> 00:25.330
Connor: We only signed because
Agent Lanford

00:25.330 --> 00:27.880
used Asher's murder
to coerce us.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.790
Annalise has a recording
of you two claiming

00:29.790 --> 00:32.000
I coerced you into
testifying against her.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.290
Do we need to cuff you?

00:33.290 --> 00:34.920
I know who started
the war against you.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.250
Hannah hating me
isn't news, Vivian.

00:37.250 --> 00:38.580
So you don't know.
Know what?

00:38.580 --> 00:40.000
What happened
with her and Sam.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.330
We found Xavier.

00:41.330 --> 00:42.920
He confessed.
Said it was all the Governor.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.040
I took care of it.

00:47.790 --> 00:49.330
You killed him?

00:49.330 --> 00:51.750
The guy that was the key
to Annalise's whole case?!

00:51.750 --> 00:54.000
Calm down.
We needed Xavier on the stand
to connect the governor --

00:54.000 --> 00:55.210
He was never gonna confess
to that on the stand.

00:55.210 --> 00:56.790
That wasn't your call
to make.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.080
They're all my calls
from now on.

00:58.080 --> 00:59.120
You hear me?
Is that right?

00:59.120 --> 01:00.500
Well, we at least
got to go back

01:00.500 --> 01:02.000
and deal with his body.
No, we'll leave him there.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.460
What?
I got a plan,

01:03.460 --> 01:05.460
and that means you do nothing
until I tell you.

01:05.460 --> 01:07.580
That plan involve framing me
or Annalise for this?

01:07.580 --> 01:09.540
Stop.
You played us before.

01:09.540 --> 01:11.290
And I'll do it again if you
don't follow my lead here.

01:11.290 --> 01:13.040
'Cause right now
I'm focused on the FBI.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.830
Annalise: You're the informants.
Admit it.

01:16.830 --> 01:19.790
Admit that you agreed
to testify against me.

01:19.790 --> 01:22.170
Michaela: Fine, it's us.
Connor: We only signed
because Agent Lanford

01:22.170 --> 01:24.290
used Asher's murder
to coerce us.

01:24.290 --> 01:25.710
And it worked.
We fell for it.

01:27.210 --> 01:28.380
Explain.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.210
She already knew
we were the informants.

01:31.210 --> 01:33.120
How?

01:33.120 --> 01:34.790
She's not an idiot.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.670
That's why she called
Connor and me over.

01:36.670 --> 01:38.920
So we decided to tell her
that you coerced us

01:38.920 --> 01:40.080
to get her trust back.

01:43.540 --> 01:45.620
You said yourself
to stay in her good graces.

01:45.620 --> 01:48.210
And she can't use
that recording at her trial.

01:48.210 --> 01:49.830
Pennsylvania
has two-party consent.

01:49.830 --> 01:51.540
So you want to stay
with your current deal?

01:51.540 --> 01:52.620
Yes, of course.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.380
No.

01:55.380 --> 01:56.670
Why?

01:56.670 --> 01:57.960
You violated the terms

01:57.960 --> 02:00.040
the second you outed yourself
as an informant.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.290
Michaela:
But I'm still agreeing

02:01.290 --> 02:03.120
to testify
against Annalise,

02:03.120 --> 02:04.500
to say everything
you wanted.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.120
How do I know you didn't
tell her other things

02:06.120 --> 02:07.290
that weren't on
the recording?

02:07.290 --> 02:08.790
We didn't tell her
anything else.

02:08.790 --> 02:10.000
How can I be sure?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.420
Because I'm telling you
right now

02:11.420 --> 02:13.080
that I'm sticking
to our deal.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.750
Michaela will, too.

02:14.750 --> 02:17.460
We'll testify to what happened
with Rebecca, ADA Sinclair...

02:17.460 --> 02:18.790
The Hapstalls, Simon Drake.

02:18.790 --> 02:21.580
Even that she coerced us
into Sam's murder.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.170
Okay.

02:23.170 --> 02:26.080
But first we have to
renegotiate new terms.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.790
That means providing
additional testimony.

02:28.790 --> 02:30.960
Michaela: We've already
told you everything we know.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.330
And you don't have
a case without us.

02:32.330 --> 02:33.790
This isn't your decision,
Michaela.

02:33.790 --> 02:35.000
Agree to new terms,

02:35.000 --> 02:36.830
or we'll charge you
with everything,

02:36.830 --> 02:38.420
including
Asher's murder.

02:38.420 --> 02:39.580
We didn't kill Asher.

02:39.580 --> 02:41.670
Says you.

02:41.670 --> 02:44.580
So, are you ready
to hear our new ask?

02:59.290 --> 03:00.790
Annalise:

03:01.830 --> 03:03.040
There whiskey in there?

03:03.040 --> 03:04.460
I'm sober.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.080
And so are you, at least
the last time I checked.

03:07.830 --> 03:09.540
Now talk.

03:09.540 --> 03:11.420
What'd Hannah tell you?

03:13.170 --> 03:15.670
This isn't something
she told me.

03:15.670 --> 03:18.920
But you've been
talking to her.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.120
Hannah called me
after Sam died.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.830
She said you --

03:22.830 --> 03:24.120
she thought
you were involved,

03:24.120 --> 03:26.000
but I wasn't having it.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.920
We haven't spoken since.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.290
Why?

03:29.290 --> 03:32.210
Because she doesn't know
about Gabriel.

03:32.210 --> 03:33.540
And the last thing I wanted

03:33.540 --> 03:35.710
was my son getting pulled
into her mess.

03:35.710 --> 03:37.460
What mess?

03:39.500 --> 03:41.380
Sam: Dear Vivian --

03:41.380 --> 03:43.120
I know I'm the last person

03:43.120 --> 03:45.750
you want to hear from
right now.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.210
I couldn't live with myself

03:47.210 --> 03:49.750
if I didn't at least try
to be in our son's life...

03:49.750 --> 03:51.380
and your life.

03:51.380 --> 03:53.710
So this is me trying.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.120
But please know this.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.580
I've never stopped
loving you.

03:57.580 --> 04:00.000
All my love, Sam.

04:11.500 --> 04:14.380
Can I play on the computer
a little before bed?

04:14.380 --> 04:15.580
You know why you need
to go to sleep?

04:15.580 --> 04:20.380
Because tomorrow
we're playing hooky.

04:20.380 --> 04:21.710
Grandma wouldn't
like that.

04:21.710 --> 04:23.380
I'm your mother --

04:23.380 --> 04:26.210
even if I was gone
for a little bit,

04:26.210 --> 04:27.580
and I'm back now,

04:27.580 --> 04:30.670
and I'm offering you
some fun.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.670
Unless you'd rather
go to school?

04:31.670 --> 04:33.500
No way.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.920
Just don't tell Grandma.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.080
Now go to bed.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.330
Annie?

05:09.960 --> 05:12.540
I got to do
some work downstairs.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.250
For what?

05:14.250 --> 05:16.250
Hannah just e-mailed me
a draft of a speech

05:16.250 --> 05:18.790
for a conference and...

05:18.790 --> 05:20.080
Right.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.580
How about a date night
this weekend?

05:26.580 --> 05:29.040
Go dancing.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.960
Dancing?

05:30.960 --> 05:33.000
I've still got moves.
You'll see.

05:35.620 --> 05:36.830
Sure.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.500
Just don't stay up
too late.

05:44.290 --> 05:47.920
Vivian: He called me that night
and agreed to come visit.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.420
You told me
that you and Sam

05:49.420 --> 05:51.460
only talked on the phone
back then.
I lied.

05:51.460 --> 05:52.790
So, how do I know
you're not lying

05:52.790 --> 05:54.170
about everything else
right now?

05:54.170 --> 05:57.750
Because you helped my son,
we -- we've built trust --

05:57.750 --> 05:58.920
I don't trust you.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.250
I'm telling you the truth now,
Annalise.

06:01.250 --> 06:02.500
You want it or not?

06:18.920 --> 06:20.460
Hi.

06:26.290 --> 06:28.380
Where's Gabriel?

06:28.380 --> 06:30.170
Not here.

06:30.170 --> 06:32.250
My mom took him away
for the weekend.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.540
You invited me here
to meet him.

06:34.540 --> 06:37.210
It's not fair to introduce
a boy to his father

06:37.210 --> 06:39.420
and then take him away
a day later.

06:39.420 --> 06:41.580
I'll stay here as long
as you'll have me.

06:41.580 --> 06:43.670
'Cause we're -- we're about
to be the Brady Bunch

06:43.670 --> 06:44.750
all of a sudden?

06:44.750 --> 06:45.830
No.

06:47.540 --> 06:51.080
How is it possible
you still love me?

06:51.080 --> 06:52.920
You don't even
know me anymore.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.960
That's some memory
you're in love with.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.500
Or it's just a line
to get close to my son.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.670
Our son.

06:57.670 --> 07:00.170
DNA does not
make you a father.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.330
Okay, look.

07:07.330 --> 07:12.540
I'll do anything
to know you again, Viv.

07:12.540 --> 07:15.330
Annalise cheat on you with her
new therapist or something?

07:15.330 --> 07:17.790
This has nothing
to do with her.

07:17.790 --> 07:20.380
It's you, Viv.

07:20.380 --> 07:24.710
I didn't know what we had
until it was too late.

07:24.710 --> 07:29.080
Even now, I...

07:29.080 --> 07:32.170
I still...feel it.

07:34.500 --> 07:38.250
Let me give you
what you want.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.500
Just tell me to stop.

08:06.290 --> 08:08.120
Mm.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.710
We even yet?

08:16.710 --> 08:18.420
This isn't me bragging,
Annalise.

08:18.420 --> 08:21.420
Sam slept with Lila, too.
God knows who else.

08:21.420 --> 08:23.750
There's no surprise there --
"you lose 'em how you got 'em."

08:23.750 --> 08:26.960
Think about how Sam always used
sex to get what he wanted --

08:26.960 --> 08:29.380
Enough.
I'm guessing he did
the same thing with you.

08:29.380 --> 08:31.330
Generous sometimes,
freaky others --

08:31.330 --> 08:32.880
I don't want to do this.
You're --

08:32.880 --> 08:35.710
That's how he played us.

08:35.710 --> 08:38.290
And what woman do you think
he learned that from?

08:41.620 --> 08:42.750
No.
Yes.

08:42.750 --> 08:43.710
Sam told you that?

08:43.710 --> 08:44.920
He didn't need to.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.380
Get out.

08:46.380 --> 08:49.710
Who was Sam closest to
his whole life?

08:49.710 --> 08:52.420
And when their parents ignored
them their whole childhood?

08:52.420 --> 08:56.500
Left them to fend
for themselves?

08:56.500 --> 09:00.380
Hannah and Sam
were desperate for love.

09:00.380 --> 09:02.580
So they found it
in each other.

09:11.170 --> 09:13.380
Nate's probably
at the FBI right now.

09:13.380 --> 09:13.960
Telling Lanford
I killed Xavier.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.330
He won't do that.

09:15.330 --> 09:17.750
Why would he want me to
leave the body there?

09:17.750 --> 09:19.750
I'll talk to him.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.880
Come here.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.380
We should've never let him
see Xavier.

09:26.380 --> 09:29.000
And what was your plan?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.830
Beat him until he agreed
to testify?

09:36.040 --> 09:40.250
When this is all over,

09:40.250 --> 09:41.620
I don't gotta
be this guy anymore.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.830
I just want you
to be you.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.620
You're going to
help me with this.

09:53.620 --> 09:56.500
Frank: Even if Vivian responds,
forget her, the kid.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.420
Hey, it's me.

10:00.420 --> 10:01.670
What's wrong?

10:01.670 --> 10:03.460
I just thought that,
since you're with your sister,

10:03.460 --> 10:04.830
I could talk to her.

10:04.830 --> 10:07.120
Why?
Uh, to thank her.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.960
She's the one that got you
to come see me in jail,

10:08.960 --> 10:11.790
so she's kind of responsible
for getting me out.

10:11.790 --> 10:14.420
Hannah doesn't want
to talk to you, Frank.

10:14.420 --> 10:16.120
Don't call here again.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.920
Who's Frank?

10:23.330 --> 10:25.330
He's a guy
who works for me.

10:25.330 --> 10:27.540
He thinks
you're at Hannah's?

10:27.540 --> 10:29.120
Yeah.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.960
So that's how
this is gonna go?

10:30.960 --> 10:32.330
Now I'm the mistress.

10:32.330 --> 10:35.080
I'm gonna leave Annalise
no matter what happens here.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.920
Then why haven't you?

10:37.920 --> 10:40.210
You just want to make sure
you have me locked down first?

10:40.210 --> 10:41.420
No.

10:44.040 --> 10:46.790
We lost a baby.

10:46.790 --> 10:48.670
He was 8 months along.

10:48.670 --> 10:52.790
It was a car accident,
and, uh, Annie's...

10:52.790 --> 10:55.500
she's still in grief.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.670
When was this?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.750
Did this just happen?

11:00.750 --> 11:02.580
We were broken
before that, Viv.
No, stay there!

11:02.580 --> 11:06.170
All this stuff
about loving me, Gabriel --

11:06.170 --> 11:08.080
it's 'cause
your replacement kid died?

11:08.080 --> 11:11.540
No. I messed up
when I left you, okay?

11:11.540 --> 11:12.670
I'm messed up.

11:12.670 --> 11:14.040
You damn straight.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.040
I-I mean, I just --
I can't...

11:16.040 --> 11:17.330
I-I can't get out of it.

11:17.330 --> 11:19.540
It's...

11:19.540 --> 11:22.380
Maybe it's...

11:22.380 --> 11:23.750
it's still living
in that house.

11:26.540 --> 11:31.170
Is that why you want
to be a father so bad?

11:31.170 --> 11:33.170
So you can correct what happened
to you as a boy?

11:33.170 --> 11:34.290
Is that so wrong?

11:34.290 --> 11:36.420
Your parents neglected you,
Sam, yeah,

11:36.420 --> 11:37.960
but at least
they gave you money.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.420
Money is not love.

11:39.420 --> 11:40.500
It's better
than getting your ass beat.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.170
It wasn't a childhood, Viv.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.670
What happened to me
and Hannah...

11:46.670 --> 11:50.120
We weren't okay.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.500
And now I-I feel like I've done
the same thing to Gabriel.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.250
I neglected him.

11:53.250 --> 11:56.620
So, please --

11:56.620 --> 11:59.210
let me be in
both your lives.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.710
I told him no.

12:06.710 --> 12:08.380
That whatever sickness
he felt inside,

12:08.380 --> 12:09.620
he was not gonna
put on my son.

12:09.620 --> 12:11.880
But the incest?
You just made that story up?

12:11.880 --> 12:13.540
I did my research.

12:13.540 --> 12:16.500
Incest comes out of neglect
a lot of the time.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.420
Then when you think
about both him and Hannah

12:18.420 --> 12:19.540
becoming psychologists,

12:19.540 --> 12:22.620
that's so they could
try to understand it.

12:22.620 --> 12:24.290
And I'm guessing she was
all up in your marriage

12:24.290 --> 12:25.750
like she was in mine.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.920
Wanting to talk
about Sam all the time,

12:27.920 --> 12:29.750
asking questions
she shouldn't be asking --

12:29.750 --> 12:31.290
I never let her anywhere
near my marriage.

12:31.290 --> 12:32.830
Why?
Because you sensed

12:32.830 --> 12:35.210
something extra
between them, right?

12:35.210 --> 12:36.500
"Mistress"?

12:36.500 --> 12:38.250
Is that still how
you see yourself, Annalise?

12:38.250 --> 12:40.210
Better than the sister
obsessing her entire life

12:40.210 --> 12:41.250
over her brother.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.420
How's the saying go?

12:42.420 --> 12:44.500
"Incest is best --
put your brother to the test"?

12:47.460 --> 12:48.500
Go home.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.380
Are you serious?
And take your son with you.

12:50.380 --> 12:52.670
I mean it. I have nothing left
to give either of you.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.500
Oh, boy.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.880
Get out!

13:24.120 --> 13:25.460
Hey.

13:25.460 --> 13:27.580
Hey.

13:27.580 --> 13:29.120
How was Hannah?

13:29.120 --> 13:30.330
Great.

13:30.330 --> 13:32.000
She's gonna bring
the house down

13:32.000 --> 13:34.540
with her talk on Reactive
Attachment Disorder.

13:34.540 --> 13:36.120
Ew.

13:37.790 --> 13:40.290
You two talk about me?

13:40.290 --> 13:42.040
I'd be offended
if you didn't.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.120
I know you two speak
the same quack language.

13:49.460 --> 13:51.670
How many drinks
have you had?

13:51.670 --> 13:52.880
I'm telling you
I want to listen,

13:52.880 --> 13:54.290
and that's your response?

13:54.290 --> 13:55.670
You're a lot more open
after a few drinks.

13:55.670 --> 13:57.080
Who isn't?

13:57.080 --> 13:58.750
I'm sorry, okay?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.210
You don't have to say
what you think I want to hear.

14:00.210 --> 14:03.120
How about we go upstairs
and I'll run a bath,

14:03.120 --> 14:04.710
rub your feet, okay?

14:04.710 --> 14:05.710
Mm.
Hmm?

14:05.710 --> 14:07.670
And then we'll talk.

14:12.710 --> 14:13.710
You're home!

14:13.710 --> 14:15.290
Just now.

14:15.290 --> 14:16.710
Hungry?
We -- We got Lao's.

14:16.710 --> 14:17.960
Annalise: Ooh.
Someone clean the table.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.250
Frank and I got it.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.080
Bonnie, can you, uh, grab
a couple wine glasses for us?

14:22.080 --> 14:23.620
Mm-hmm.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.540
You checking up on me?

14:28.540 --> 14:30.170
I just wanted
to thank Hannah.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.250
In what world
do I introduce my sister

14:32.250 --> 14:34.880
to the man
who killed my son?

14:34.880 --> 14:36.620
I'm sorry.

14:36.620 --> 14:38.380
Everything okay?

14:38.380 --> 14:40.620
Yeah.
Yep.

14:40.620 --> 14:42.620
Let's eat.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.170
Just no one touch
my pork dumplings,

14:44.170 --> 14:45.710
or I'll cut your hand off.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.170
Tell me you don't
believe this.

14:53.170 --> 14:55.330
Anything's possible
at this point.

14:55.330 --> 14:57.500
If Vivian's right,
it could help your case.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.960
How?

14:58.960 --> 15:01.670
Hannah started this whole
conspiracy against me --

15:01.670 --> 15:05.210
getting the FBI or whoever else
to believe that I'm a killer --

15:05.210 --> 15:07.210
because I stole her man.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.290
No one's gonna buy that.

15:08.290 --> 15:11.000
It's a jury trial.
They just need doubt.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.330
No, they need proof
to have doubt.

15:12.330 --> 15:13.750
That's why you're here.

15:13.750 --> 15:15.290
Go to Xavier
and get him to admit

15:15.290 --> 15:16.580
that he's been talking
to Hannah.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.710
What?

15:21.710 --> 15:23.830
Nate kind of screwed
things up with Xavier.

15:29.040 --> 15:31.580
Nate,
Special Agent Pollock --

15:31.580 --> 15:34.250
she runs point in our search
for Xavier Castillo.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.080
She knows you'd like
an update.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.880
As would I,
if I were in your shoes.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.170
Glad to finally meet.

15:39.170 --> 15:40.880
Nate: And the FBI Agent?
Pollock?

15:40.880 --> 15:42.290
She's Birkhead's, too.

15:42.290 --> 15:44.000
Birkhead called
every shot.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.380
What do you have for me?

15:45.380 --> 15:46.540
Let's sit.

15:50.710 --> 15:53.620
Here you can see our phone taps
and PEN registers

15:53.620 --> 15:56.460
on all Xavier's relatives
and associates,

15:56.460 --> 15:58.000
none of whom
he's contacted.

15:59.420 --> 16:00.670
That's all you got?

16:00.670 --> 16:02.880
For now.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.750
Nate,
your Keating testimony

16:04.750 --> 16:06.750
is likely to be
our best card at the trial,

16:06.750 --> 16:08.710
so know that the FBI
is doing everything we can

16:08.710 --> 16:09.920
to get you justice here.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.210
Hey.

16:22.210 --> 16:23.380
Where the hell
have you been?

16:23.380 --> 16:24.670
I went to the gym
for once.

16:24.670 --> 16:26.290
Good morning to you,
too.

16:26.290 --> 16:29.120
Put your best investigator
on Hannah Keating.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.080
Find out
if she's been talking to

16:31.080 --> 16:32.750
Xavier,
the FBI, governor...

16:32.750 --> 16:33.830
Since when do you think
Hannah has that much power?

16:33.830 --> 16:34.830
I don't.

16:34.830 --> 16:36.540
Vivian does.

16:36.540 --> 16:38.290
Vivian-the-junkie
is someone we trust now?

16:38.290 --> 16:39.670
It makes sense.

16:39.670 --> 16:42.250
Okay, I know Hannah thinks
you killed her brother.

16:42.250 --> 16:45.120
No, she thinks
I killed her lover.

16:46.750 --> 16:48.000
Uh, okay.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.080
Is this...
Are you drunk right now?

16:50.080 --> 16:52.330
Tegan, if I were my attorney,
I would hang up this phone

16:52.330 --> 16:53.880
and call my investigator

16:53.880 --> 16:57.000
because I know how good
this would be for the trial.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.620
You're right.
Yeah.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.420
Agent Lanford:
You didn't eat your breakfast.

17:16.790 --> 17:18.710
I want to
speak with Connor.

17:18.710 --> 17:20.210
No.

17:20.210 --> 17:22.830
But I'm here if you want
to talk about the deal.

17:22.830 --> 17:25.790
Are you dirty?

17:25.790 --> 17:30.000
Because this deal
is full of lies.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.170
Lies?
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

17:33.170 --> 17:35.790
And, yes,
I agreed to tell one lie.

17:35.790 --> 17:37.460
No one has ever
asked you to lie.

17:37.460 --> 17:40.210
You're asking me
to commit perjury times ten.

17:43.380 --> 17:45.040
Take more time to think.

17:48.750 --> 17:52.210
Can I have my phone?

17:52.210 --> 17:53.790
I haven't called
my lawyer yet

17:53.790 --> 17:57.880
because I thought
we could fix this in good faith.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.290
I'll call her myself.

18:08.960 --> 18:13.040
Just give me one good reason
why you can't leave.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.210
You think the FBI
can't find me in Chicago?

18:15.210 --> 18:18.120
Of course they can. I just --
I would be there to protect you.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.040
From the Feds?

18:20.040 --> 18:23.460
You came here to find out
what happened to Sam.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.790
But guess what.

18:25.790 --> 18:27.330
We might never know,
baby.

18:27.330 --> 18:32.170
And if there's any wisdom
I've gained in my messy life,

18:32.170 --> 18:36.330
especially
from your father,

18:36.330 --> 18:39.040
it's that you have to
let go of the past.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.460
Is this more about me?

18:49.460 --> 18:50.670
Because I was such
a bad mother?

18:52.880 --> 18:54.380
You weren't a bad mother.

18:54.380 --> 18:56.250
I was an addict, baby.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.290
My sickness hurt you.

18:58.290 --> 19:00.790
But I'm here now.

19:00.790 --> 19:03.500
And I will dive in front
of any bullet headed your way.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.120
I just need you
to give me that chance.

19:07.620 --> 19:11.330
You ever think about what
would've happened if --

19:11.330 --> 19:13.170
if Sam would've
stayed with you?

19:15.790 --> 19:17.420
Where the three of us
would be?

19:17.420 --> 19:22.170
Honestly, I think
we're both lucky he left.

19:22.170 --> 19:25.500
There's just some people
you can't save.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.620
But you're not him, baby.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.210
Hello?
Frank: This Vivian?

19:38.210 --> 19:39.790
Who's this?

19:39.790 --> 19:43.080
Were you with Sam
this weekend?

19:43.080 --> 19:45.540
If you ever
talk to him again,

19:45.540 --> 19:46.750
I'm coming for you

19:46.750 --> 19:48.580
and your kid.

19:52.460 --> 19:54.380
Is this Frank?

19:59.250 --> 20:01.290
Who was that?

20:01.290 --> 20:03.000
Some bookie.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.420
My dad's underwater,

20:04.420 --> 20:06.040
so I had to put
the fear of God in him.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.420
So that has nothing to do
with that conversation

20:08.420 --> 20:10.170
between you and Sam
last night?

20:10.170 --> 20:13.000
Me and Sam
got our own relationship,

20:13.000 --> 20:14.540
just like the two of you.

20:14.540 --> 20:15.790
So that was therapy?

20:15.790 --> 20:18.960
Our version.

20:18.960 --> 20:23.460
Speaking of my messed-up family,
you want to meet 'em Wednesday?

20:23.460 --> 20:25.380
It's ziti night.
They're dying to meet you.

20:45.420 --> 20:46.790
What happened?

20:50.380 --> 20:51.620
Sam:
You knew about this?!

20:51.620 --> 20:53.880
I was suspicious,
but now you got confirmation.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.460
And you're not disturbed?

20:55.460 --> 20:57.790
They're two twenty-somethings
locked in this house all day.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.330
Bonnie is not your typical
20-something.

20:59.330 --> 21:01.830
She's lonely, Sam,
and Frank is good-looking.

21:01.830 --> 21:03.210
He's an ex-con.

21:03.210 --> 21:05.210
Who you encouraged me
to get out of jail.

21:05.210 --> 21:06.670
Who knows,
Bonnie may be good for him.

21:06.670 --> 21:08.830
No, he's not good for her,
is more my concern.

21:08.830 --> 21:10.330
How do you know?
Are you kidding?

21:10.330 --> 21:12.710
She's an abuse survivor, yeah,
but that doesn't mean

21:12.710 --> 21:14.500
that she can't mess around
with a guy every now and then.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.380
She knows herself that Frank
is not right for her.

21:16.380 --> 21:18.790
Well, who's right for her
beside you?

21:20.210 --> 21:21.380
Excuse me?

21:21.380 --> 21:23.000
This isn't you
being jealous?

21:25.620 --> 21:27.620
We're talking about Bonnie.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.540
One bad experience
could set her back decades.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.380
Is that what
your books say?

21:31.380 --> 21:32.880
Which means that you know
more than someone

21:32.880 --> 21:34.790
who's actually experienced
what Bonnie has gone through?

21:34.790 --> 21:36.880
I have personal experience
with this, too, Annie.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.420
Your parents left you
and Hannah alone in a big house

21:39.420 --> 21:40.710
because they didn't
like having kids.

21:40.710 --> 21:42.170
That's not rape.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.500
Look.

21:49.500 --> 21:54.620
All I'm saying is that Bonnie
deserves love, too.

21:54.620 --> 21:57.460
Of course.

21:57.460 --> 22:00.080
But love and abuse often feel
like the same thing.

22:00.080 --> 22:04.120
And these two together...

22:04.120 --> 22:05.750
it's not okay.

22:24.540 --> 22:25.920
Can you sit your ass down?

22:25.920 --> 22:27.500
Know what would help me
not spin out?

22:27.500 --> 22:28.880
If you let me get rid
of Xavier's body.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.290
Do nothing.

22:30.290 --> 22:32.120
And stop leaving
your blood everywhere.

22:34.790 --> 22:36.880
So, maybe Vivian's
not crazy.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.290
Lou dug up
Hannah's phone records.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.580
They place her in Philly

22:39.580 --> 22:41.250
on four occasions
in the past year,

22:41.250 --> 22:42.710
some near
the FBI building.

22:42.710 --> 22:43.920
This isn't enough.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.380
It proves she's probably
hounding the FBI

22:45.380 --> 22:46.460
to come after you.

22:46.460 --> 22:48.790
We need proof
of her and Sam.

22:48.790 --> 22:50.250
And how the hell
do we get that?

22:50.250 --> 22:52.460
What about my Aunt Bev?

22:52.460 --> 22:55.120
Your Aunt Bev knows my sister
Hannah from high school.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.170
I could go talk to her.

22:57.170 --> 23:00.460
And ask her if Hannah
confessed to incest?

23:00.460 --> 23:01.750
Okay.

23:01.750 --> 23:04.120
I'll go back to Lou,
see what else he can dig up.

23:07.580 --> 23:08.960
At least let me
go talk to Nate.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.170
Sit.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.540
I can't stop!
Oh, my God!

23:27.540 --> 23:29.210
Oh, please. Oh!

23:29.210 --> 23:30.250
Help!

23:36.000 --> 23:37.920
It's Lahey.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.880
Yeah, I need to get some
traffic-cam footage from you.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.500
Corner of 21st and Spring.

23:43.210 --> 23:44.210
I'll call you back.

23:50.460 --> 23:52.080
Frank said
you had a plan.

24:05.620 --> 24:07.710
We can put
a deadline on this, Connor.

24:07.710 --> 24:11.170
Would that help you
make a decision?

24:11.170 --> 24:14.790
Me not talking
isn't a strategy.

24:14.790 --> 24:16.750
I just don't care anymore.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.620
Well, here's what I can do
to make you care.

24:18.620 --> 24:20.540
Since you're unhappy
with your current deal,

24:20.540 --> 24:22.210
we can add your husband
as a co-defendant.

24:25.380 --> 24:30.290
Computer trespass and hacking,
cyber fraud, breach of privacy,

24:30.290 --> 24:34.830
forgery, criminal mischief,
destruction of evidence.

24:36.420 --> 24:40.120
I might go to prison,

24:40.120 --> 24:43.710
but the whole time
I'm in there,

24:43.710 --> 24:45.380
I'm gonna work
to expose you

24:45.380 --> 24:47.920
as the corrupt agent
who disgraced the FBI.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.880
This isn't who you are.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.670
I can see it
in your eyes.

24:54.670 --> 24:56.580
And what can you see?

24:56.580 --> 24:59.540
I think you hate the idea
of letting Annalise win.

24:59.540 --> 25:02.290
This ain't got nothing
to do with beating Annalise.

25:02.290 --> 25:04.120
It's about beating
the governor.

25:04.120 --> 25:06.580
Taking out Xavier --
just the start.

25:09.210 --> 25:11.830
You want to be Frank.

25:11.830 --> 25:14.120
You're not.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.250
You're just
destroying yourself.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.750
Nate, it's starting to feel
like I'm working for you.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.330
What's this?

25:31.330 --> 25:32.830
Traffic-cam photo
from the night

25:32.830 --> 25:34.710
of Bonnie Winterbottom's
car accident.

25:34.710 --> 25:40.460
That photo puts Pollock two
blocks away, exact same time.

25:40.460 --> 25:42.830
Winterbottom's part
of our investigation.

25:42.830 --> 25:44.540
It's Pollock's job
to tail her sometimes.

25:44.540 --> 25:46.880
The brakes went out --
According to Winterbottom,

25:46.880 --> 25:49.790
somebody we both know has
a history of suicide ideation.

25:49.790 --> 25:53.620
Or you got a corrupt agent
working for the Castillos.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.830
You in on it, too?

25:58.210 --> 25:59.620
Not everybody here
wanted me to offer you

25:59.620 --> 26:01.380
an immunity deal, Nate.

26:01.380 --> 26:02.420
You want to
change your mind?

26:02.420 --> 26:04.040
Do you?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.920
Because you were at the same
wedding as D.A. Miller

26:05.920 --> 26:07.670
the night he was murdered.

26:07.670 --> 26:09.500
Circumstantial evidence.

26:09.500 --> 26:10.830
I've convicted people
with less.

26:10.830 --> 26:14.170
Not people you need to testify
against Annalise Keating.

26:14.170 --> 26:15.880
Now, if you're as clean
as you claim,

26:15.880 --> 26:17.620
look into Pollock.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.210
Or who knows
what I'll say on the stand.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.750
Nate come to
his senses?

26:31.750 --> 26:33.580
He thinks
he knows better.

26:33.580 --> 26:35.670
Like all the idiot men
in our lives.

26:44.790 --> 26:46.250
Why are we down here?

26:46.250 --> 26:48.830
You and Bonnie are over.

26:51.290 --> 26:53.960
Well, that's not for you
to decide.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.250
Her father raped her,
Frank.

26:58.080 --> 27:02.420
Started when she was 5 --
he'd record it, sell it.

27:02.420 --> 27:03.920
Her mom knew.

27:03.920 --> 27:08.960
They took money from people,
sold her.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.250
Well, you like her, sure,

27:12.250 --> 27:14.960
but do you really have
what it takes

27:14.960 --> 27:16.960
to be there for her?

27:16.960 --> 27:21.540
Now, not for a few months,
a year, but for a life.

27:24.380 --> 27:28.460
Because you know yourself,

27:28.460 --> 27:32.830
what kind of guy you are,
the real you...

27:32.830 --> 27:34.620
and you'll destroy her.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.080
Bonnie:
You leaving already?

27:48.420 --> 27:50.830
I'm not feeling so hot.

27:50.830 --> 27:52.040
Do you have a fever?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.880
Frank?

27:56.880 --> 27:59.250
Them finding out, it --

27:59.250 --> 28:01.330
it makes things
too complicated.

28:06.080 --> 28:09.670
If that's
what this is about,

28:09.670 --> 28:13.460
I don't have
to keep interning here.

28:13.460 --> 28:17.540
I'm not a serious guy, Bon.
You know that.

28:17.540 --> 28:20.250
And I'd probably
eventually cheat, so...

28:22.670 --> 28:25.250
You'll find someone better.
I know it.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.250
Come in.

28:52.170 --> 28:54.790
What happened?

28:54.790 --> 28:55.710
Frank.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.880
I'm so stupid.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.420
No.

29:09.120 --> 29:13.120
It's why
I didn't tell you,

29:13.120 --> 29:15.290
'cause I knew
this would happen.

29:15.290 --> 29:16.290
No.

29:16.290 --> 29:20.080
You're not stupid.
You're brave.

29:22.380 --> 29:24.750
The girl I first met
would've never even let herself

29:24.750 --> 29:28.710
think about
a relationship or love.

29:28.710 --> 29:31.250
'Cause that's
the hardest part,

29:31.250 --> 29:32.790
believing you deserve it.

29:36.790 --> 29:38.880
But you deserve
more than anyone, Bonnie.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.620
And leave Frank's
dumbass to me.

29:44.620 --> 29:45.880
I'll teach him.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.380
Tegan, tell Lou that I said
to do whatever he can

29:58.380 --> 29:59.670
to get his hands on
the yearbooks,

29:59.670 --> 30:02.120
doctor records, whatever.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.580
They found nothing.

30:08.540 --> 30:11.500
Did Sam say anything to you
in your sessions?

30:11.500 --> 30:12.710
No.

30:12.710 --> 30:14.790
You sure?

30:14.790 --> 30:20.790
Look, I know how much
you want to believe Vivian,

30:20.790 --> 30:23.380
but there's a really good chance
none of this is true.

30:23.380 --> 30:26.670
I know.

30:26.670 --> 30:28.920
Problem is
I believe her.

30:32.670 --> 30:36.920
He was so good with us.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.830
That's because he was us.

30:52.710 --> 30:54.790
You okay?

30:54.790 --> 30:56.000
Was it you?

30:58.290 --> 31:02.420
You tell Frank
to break up with Bonnie?

31:04.580 --> 31:07.580
No.

31:07.580 --> 31:09.080
But I'm not gonna
pretend to be upset.

31:15.380 --> 31:17.880
Bonnie...

31:17.880 --> 31:19.170
Bonnie will be okay.

31:19.170 --> 31:21.120
She's strong.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.080
I'll get us a refill.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.960
What's this?

31:34.540 --> 31:37.540
They're his ashes.

31:37.540 --> 31:40.960
I thought we could spread them
at my parents' gravesite.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.670
Just the two of us.

31:42.670 --> 31:44.830
Or...

31:44.830 --> 31:46.290
a minister if you want.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.880
I don't want
any part of it.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.170
Why?

32:01.080 --> 32:03.120
Because every time
you bring him up,

32:03.120 --> 32:04.960
I can feel you blaming me.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.040
You didn't do this!

32:06.040 --> 32:07.080
How many times
can I tell you that?

32:07.080 --> 32:08.580
You don't mean it!

32:08.580 --> 32:10.170
I can feel you
avoiding me.

32:10.170 --> 32:12.000
You can't even stand
to be alone with me.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.670
You blame me for asking you to
have a baby in the first place.

32:13.670 --> 32:14.920
Yeah, I do.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.040
Okay,
so it's my fault

32:16.040 --> 32:17.330
that we're buried
under this grief, okay?

32:17.330 --> 32:18.500
That way, you don't have to
feel anything.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.000
I'm in constant pain.
That's all I feel.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.830
You're not the only one in pain,
though, Annie!

32:21.830 --> 32:23.620
Our son died,
I am his father,

32:23.620 --> 32:25.670
and I failed
to protect him.

32:25.670 --> 32:26.960
Me.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.670
And I...

32:29.670 --> 32:32.500
You what?

32:32.500 --> 32:34.620
You want a hug?

32:34.620 --> 32:35.790
You want Mammy to hold you,

32:35.790 --> 32:36.790
tell you everything's
gonna be okay?

32:36.790 --> 32:38.380
I want my wife to do that!

32:38.380 --> 32:42.210
Well, I'm too tired
holding myself!

32:42.210 --> 32:44.790
I'm alone here trying
to inch my way back to life,

32:44.790 --> 32:46.920
and -- and you keep running off
to cry to your sister.

32:46.920 --> 32:49.250
So I'm the villain now.
No, I --
that's not what I mean.

32:49.250 --> 32:51.580
Because you're perfect,
as always.
No, I'm a mess.

32:51.580 --> 32:53.080
And, apparently, that's why
you fell in love with me,

32:53.080 --> 32:54.120
and now you can't
handle it.

32:54.120 --> 32:55.500
Because I'm not
perfect either!

32:55.500 --> 32:56.750
Well, I don't want you
to be perfect.

32:56.750 --> 32:58.620
I want you to be honest.

33:02.830 --> 33:05.210
And what if there are things
that you don't want to know?

33:05.210 --> 33:06.880
What then?

33:06.880 --> 33:08.120
I want to know.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.040
You say that now,
but what if --

33:10.040 --> 33:12.620
what if there are things
that you can't accept, Annie?

33:12.620 --> 33:14.580
Like what? Huh?
You hate me?

33:14.580 --> 33:16.290
Stop.
What else could there be,
huh?

33:16.290 --> 33:17.750
You're not attracted
to me anymore?

33:17.750 --> 33:18.830
I'm ruined for you,
I'm --

33:18.830 --> 33:21.500
I'm the one
who's ruined, okay?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.330
I'm broken.
We're all broken, Sam.

33:23.330 --> 33:25.670
I'm broken in ways
you can't fix.

33:25.670 --> 33:29.380
I am, too.
And now it...

33:29.380 --> 33:32.380
It feels too late for me,
Annie, I mean it.

33:34.790 --> 33:36.210
Well, if it's too late
for you,

33:36.210 --> 33:38.500
then it's too late
for me, too.

33:38.500 --> 33:42.250
Because all I want to do
is give up.

33:42.250 --> 33:45.460
Die.

33:45.460 --> 33:48.420
I'm fighting to get back
the life we had, Sam.

33:48.420 --> 33:49.960
I...

33:52.170 --> 33:55.170
I can't do it alone.

33:59.040 --> 34:01.120
Or do you not
love me anymore?

34:06.460 --> 34:10.380
All I want to do is love you.

34:16.830 --> 34:18.420
Annalise:
Why did we love him?

34:18.420 --> 34:21.750
Because he understood us.

34:21.750 --> 34:24.290
It was his gift...

34:24.290 --> 34:26.710
getting us to see
that we were just children,

34:26.710 --> 34:30.620
that we weren't to blame.

34:30.620 --> 34:33.250
But it was his trauma,
too.

34:33.250 --> 34:35.580
Hannah was older,
he might've been a boy.

34:37.330 --> 34:40.580
But there was no one
to tell him that.

34:40.580 --> 34:44.210
He could heal others,
but he couldn't heal himself.

34:44.210 --> 34:52.960

34:54.040 --> 35:00.790

35:43.710 --> 35:45.500
I know.

35:48.670 --> 35:50.580
But it makes me see him.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.380

36:09.210 --> 36:11.960
What's going on

36:14.170 --> 36:16.380
I'm leaving here
knowing less than when I came.

36:16.380 --> 36:17.830
Not true.

36:17.830 --> 36:19.420
You know yourself better.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.420
Do I?

36:25.290 --> 36:27.880
What I know about you...

36:27.880 --> 36:32.210
is that you are loyal

36:32.210 --> 36:34.290
and good and strong,

36:34.290 --> 36:35.670
to the point
that you stuck with me

36:35.670 --> 36:37.420
even when
I didn't deserve it.

36:37.420 --> 36:40.830
So thank you.

36:40.830 --> 36:43.040
No, thank you.

36:43.040 --> 36:49.120
Do you think I would be
this loyal or strong or good

36:49.120 --> 36:51.580
if it wasn't for all the
hardship that we went through?

36:58.920 --> 37:01.790
You made me me.

37:01.790 --> 37:03.460
Not him.

37:12.460 --> 37:15.080
You find something?

37:15.080 --> 37:17.330
Sure.
Just not what you want.

37:17.330 --> 37:19.710
Hannah's school records
and yearbooks.

37:19.710 --> 37:22.120
Lou even talked to some of her
friends from field hockey.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.040
All any of it proves
is that she was

37:24.040 --> 37:28.250
an ambitious, normal,
seemingly boring young woman.

37:28.250 --> 37:30.920
What's this?
Her report card --

37:30.920 --> 37:34.170
I mean, why did she miss 83 days
of school in her senior year?

37:34.170 --> 37:37.420
Mono.
Doctor's records verify it.

37:37.420 --> 37:38.880
Unless they were lying.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.460
Lying about what?

37:41.460 --> 37:45.540
Another reason to miss that much
school is if you're --

37:45.540 --> 37:47.000
if you're pregnant.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.540
Oliver:

37:58.540 --> 38:01.120
You don't know how hard it was
for me to not call your father.

38:01.120 --> 38:03.000
I would've killed you.
No, I know.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.460
I just thought the only reason
you'd be held so long

38:05.460 --> 38:07.290
is if you were being
interrogated or tortured --

38:07.290 --> 38:09.290
We were being tortured.
Just not physically.

38:09.290 --> 38:10.920
Mm, true.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.880
But you both got to keep
your original deals.

38:13.880 --> 38:16.120
That just shows
how tough you both are.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.920
Then why do I feel like ass?

38:17.920 --> 38:19.580
Seriously.

38:19.580 --> 38:20.710
I'm going to bed.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.620
Hey.

38:26.670 --> 38:28.460
I'm proud of us.

38:28.460 --> 38:29.790
So am I.

38:41.290 --> 38:42.330
What?

38:46.710 --> 38:48.420
I lied.

38:48.420 --> 38:51.120
About?

38:51.120 --> 38:52.960
I signed a new deal.

38:55.210 --> 38:57.250
Yeah. Okay.
Thanks, Lou.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.880
Nothing ties Hannah
to any local maternity wards

39:00.880 --> 39:02.580
or hospitals
at the time.

39:02.580 --> 39:05.330
Birth certificates?
Nothing.

39:05.330 --> 39:07.460
Unless we're looking
at the wrong month.

39:07.460 --> 39:10.170
She was back in school
March 5th.

39:10.170 --> 39:12.330
So she must've had the baby
in February.

39:12.330 --> 39:14.960
Or March, and then
she went right back.

Of course he was.

So think about how much time
he stole from us.

this sample tested

Mr. Keating's DNA is on file

40:46.750 --> 40:48.960
from the Lila Stangard
murder investigation.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.540

Hey.

I have to apologize.

About?

41:10.920 --> 41:12.080
You were right.

41:14.920 --> 41:16.330
Pollock's been
in direct contact

41:16.330 --> 41:18.620
with the Castillos
for nearly a year.

41:18.620 --> 41:21.080
Which means you clearly have
insight into things I don't.

41:23.420 --> 41:24.830
So, you want to
come down here and tell me

41:24.830 --> 41:26.210
what else I don't know?

41:26.210 --> 41:28.460
I've told you
everything I know.

41:28.460 --> 41:30.710
You gotta do the rest
of the work yourself.

41:48.420 --> 41:49.830
Bonnie: What's wrong?

41:52.960 --> 41:55.540
I have proof that
Hannah and Sam slept together.

41:55.540 --> 41:57.580
What is it?

41:57.580 --> 41:58.750
A child.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.620
I ran a DNA test against Sam,
and the sample was a match.

42:03.620 --> 42:05.540
