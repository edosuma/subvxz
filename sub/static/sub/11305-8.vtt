WEBVTT

00:01.467 --> 00:04.655
Bobo sent me. Name's Bethany.

00:04.803 --> 00:08.537
We're gonna track down the last
of the Seven if it kills me. A spade.

00:08.574 --> 00:10.481
- I'm Dr. Reggie.
- She died because

00:10.506 --> 00:12.108
humans can't survive when their

00:12.133 --> 00:13.762
- organs are removed.
- So what?

00:13.787 --> 00:16.065
In the shape of a
spade, like on a deck of cards.

00:17.546 --> 00:20.051
- I'm shutting your division down.
- I have something else.

00:20.085 --> 00:22.886
Never before documented.

00:22.921 --> 00:25.255
Any idea why your
homestead was targeted?

00:25.290 --> 00:28.525
We should at least get
some breakfast. Then we'll talk.

00:28.560 --> 00:29.962
Wynonna!

00:56.488 --> 00:58.421
Devil's hell.

01:05.063 --> 01:08.064
Plus an angel incarnate.

01:17.609 --> 01:20.110
Waverly?

01:20.145 --> 01:22.679
Doc?

01:28.253 --> 01:31.688
No, no, you're OK. Hey,
lay back. Lay back.

01:31.723 --> 01:34.424
- What happened?
- Deep breaths, Deputy Earp.

01:34.459 --> 01:35.926
You remember me?

01:35.961 --> 01:39.930
Uh... Dr. Ninja.

01:39.965 --> 01:42.057
- Am I in the morgue?
- Thankfully, no.

01:42.082 --> 01:43.433
You're in the hospital.

01:43.468 --> 01:45.888
Do you remember
anything about the accident?

01:46.036 --> 01:47.137
Accident?

01:47.172 --> 01:50.473
I was at the homestead...

01:50.509 --> 01:52.943
Zombie strippers.

01:52.978 --> 01:56.046
Oh, OK. Some memory loss

01:56.081 --> 01:58.148
is totally normal after such a trauma.

01:58.183 --> 02:00.617
Where's Waverly? Where's
my sister? Where's Doc?

02:00.652 --> 02:03.186
No, no, no. We have to
limit your visitors right now,

02:03.221 --> 02:05.221
until...

02:05.257 --> 02:07.190
Wynonna,

02:07.225 --> 02:10.293
I need you to listen to me.

02:10.329 --> 02:13.263
Why can't I move my legs?

02:13.298 --> 02:15.231
There's no easy way to
say this. You suffered

02:15.267 --> 02:16.792
severe damage to your spinal cord,

02:16.817 --> 02:18.535
causing paralysis from the waist down.

- Dolls! Dolls!
- Whoa!

02:49.468 --> 02:52.102
Hold on, son, now
there's no need for hollering.

02:52.137 --> 02:53.903
Wynonna and Officer
Haught, they've been taken.

02:53.939 --> 02:55.605
- What do you mean, taken?
- Abducted,

02:55.641 --> 02:58.121
absconded, whatever the hell
you want to call it, they're gone!

02:58.143 --> 03:00.076
What do you mean, gone?

03:00.112 --> 03:03.346
He's got them, Dolls. The Fiend himself.

03:07.753 --> 03:10.687
You don't understand. I love my legs.

03:10.722 --> 03:13.023
They're what I walk
on. What are you giving me?

03:13.058 --> 03:15.792
- I feel so...
- You feel hungover?

03:15.827 --> 03:19.129
You're very lucky, Ms. Earp.
Lucky you didn't kill anyone.

03:19.164 --> 03:22.132
I wasn't drunk... anymore.

03:22.167 --> 03:25.135
Ask... Nicole.

03:25.170 --> 03:27.570
Nicole was driving. Where's Nicole?

03:27.606 --> 03:29.439
Shh, I have to listen, OK?

03:33.412 --> 03:35.679
So you're like, a full-on doctor?

03:35.714 --> 03:37.714
Morgue duty is just
part of our rotation.

03:39.918 --> 03:41.718
I thought I might go to med school.

03:41.753 --> 03:45.255
My solid D-minus thought otherwise.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.751
- Where'd you go?
- Queens Undergraduate,

03:47.752 --> 03:50.527
Princeton Medical School.

03:50.562 --> 03:53.029
And you chose to
practice here? In Purgatory?

03:54.700 --> 03:57.467
- Lucky for me.
- Indeed. I am actually

03:57.502 --> 04:01.671
pioneering a radical new procedure
at this hospital.

04:01.707 --> 04:03.751
To increase certain brain functions,

04:03.776 --> 04:05.408
and I guess you could say...

04:05.444 --> 04:09.112
shut down others. Certain
areas of emotion

04:09.147 --> 04:11.681
cause a patient to be irrational.

04:11.717 --> 04:13.616
They can be removed.

04:13.652 --> 04:16.519
One question.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.654
Do you only use the cane

04:18.690 --> 04:21.357
as a weapon, or are you hiding
a limp under all that bullshit?

04:21.392 --> 04:23.293
Excuse me?

04:23.328 --> 04:26.129
Princeton doesn't have a
medical school, dickwad.

04:26.164 --> 04:29.566
You're not a doctor, you're
a killer. A revenant.

04:31.570 --> 04:34.838
People think that all it
takes to become a doctor is smarts.

04:34.873 --> 04:36.473
No, no, no, no.

04:36.508 --> 04:38.975
A real doctor pushes boundaries.

04:39.010 --> 04:42.112
Does things that others
find distasteful for the sake

04:42.147 --> 04:46.316
of progress. Take yourself, Wynonna.

04:46.351 --> 04:49.953
You've been a very, very bad girl.

04:49.988 --> 04:52.222
But it's not your fault, is it?

04:52.257 --> 04:55.792
There's something very
wrong, deep inside of you.

04:55.827 --> 04:57.827
And the doctor will search

04:57.863 --> 05:00.697
until he finds it, and cut it

05:00.732 --> 05:04.200
right out.

05:06.505 --> 05:08.738
Off to prep an O.R.

05:08.774 --> 05:10.707
Back in a jiff!

05:21.153 --> 05:23.153
Hello?

05:30.962 --> 05:32.662
Bethany?

05:35.066 --> 05:36.670
I'll call the Feds and I'm gonna make a

05:36.695 --> 05:38.434
discrete request for
additional resources.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.102
- We need boots on the ground.
- No.

05:40.103 --> 05:41.171
No, we need choppers in the air

05:41.206 --> 05:43.940
and jets and drones and cruise missiles

05:43.975 --> 05:46.658
- pointed right at Bobo's head!
- Wasn't Bobo that took 'em.

05:46.865 --> 05:48.429
Wasn't the Stone Witch neither.

05:48.453 --> 05:50.079
And your fancy weapons won't do anything

05:50.115 --> 05:52.015
against Jack and his knives.

05:52.050 --> 05:53.727
- What kind of man...
- To call him

05:53.752 --> 05:55.451
a man would be to speak generously.

05:55.487 --> 05:57.720
In Dodge City there was a schoolteacher

05:57.756 --> 05:59.756
name of Sally. She laughed like a mule,

05:59.791 --> 06:01.558
but her eyes did shine.

06:01.593 --> 06:03.526
I was sweet on her,

06:03.562 --> 06:05.728
but she went missing. Wyatt and me,

06:05.764 --> 06:07.697
we tracked her to a limestone cave

06:07.732 --> 06:10.567
in the hills. That's where we found her,

06:10.602 --> 06:13.636
with three other soiled doves

06:13.672 --> 06:16.039
that had been thought to have run off.

06:16.074 --> 06:19.409
He had taken their insides out.

06:19.444 --> 06:21.377
Spread them around their own bodies

06:21.413 --> 06:23.643
- like a Thanksgiving feast.
- Oh my god.

06:23.668 --> 06:24.814
Papers called him

06:24.850 --> 06:26.666
'the Jack of Knives'
on account of the fact

06:26.667 --> 06:28.510
that's what he called himself in the

06:28.535 --> 06:30.154
letters he sent, taunting them.

06:30.188 --> 06:32.789
Adept at all manner of blade.

06:32.824 --> 06:34.081
- Great.
- Wyatt and me,

06:34.106 --> 06:35.391
we made it our mission

06:35.427 --> 06:37.627
to hunt him down. We tracked him

06:37.662 --> 06:40.096
through the Cumberland
pass, nearly freezing to death,

06:40.131 --> 06:41.998
and then I got sick.

06:42.033 --> 06:44.133
Real sick.

06:44.169 --> 06:47.604
Wyatt never spoke of
Jack again, but I know

06:47.639 --> 06:50.590
he was the one that
haunted him the most.

06:50.615 --> 06:53.643
Well, Wyatt must've got him eventually,
otherwise the creep

06:53.678 --> 06:55.566
wouldn't be a revenant. He was a serial

06:55.591 --> 06:57.313
killer when he was human. Who knows

06:57.349 --> 06:58.603
what he's capable of now?

06:58.628 --> 06:59.983
Or what he's gonna do to Wynonna.

07:00.018 --> 07:02.018
Or Officer Haught.

07:06.758 --> 07:08.691
The spade.

07:08.727 --> 07:10.093
The spade...

07:10.128 --> 07:12.862
once symbolized a sword

07:12.898 --> 07:14.664
- or unsheathed blade...
- Or knife.

07:14.699 --> 07:16.532
He's the last of the Seven.

07:16.568 --> 07:18.601
Come on.

07:18.637 --> 07:20.157
Whoa, whoa, Waverly. Can't go anywhere

07:20.179 --> 07:21.437
with that broken wing of yours.

07:21.473 --> 07:22.954
Besides, I need you to
stay here and dig deep,

07:23.163 --> 07:25.475
find more on this Jack, alright?

07:25.510 --> 07:28.611
Right. Bring them home safe, OK?

07:28.647 --> 07:31.547
Of course. Alright, Holliday,

07:31.583 --> 07:33.395
you said you tracked this
guy before, right?

07:33.420 --> 07:34.684
You think you can do it again?

07:34.719 --> 07:36.886
You want my help? I figured...

07:36.922 --> 07:38.697
That I'd keep you at arms' length?

07:38.722 --> 07:40.523
Yeah, well, not this time, cowboy.

07:40.558 --> 07:42.191
Come on. Saddle up.

07:46.197 --> 07:49.332
We've found her. Officer Haught.

07:49.367 --> 07:51.734
Status?

07:51.770 --> 07:53.803
She's alive. Barely.

07:53.838 --> 07:56.172
Motorist spotted her on
the side of the highway.

07:56.207 --> 07:58.843
- EMS had to resuscitate on site.
- Damn him.

07:58.977 --> 08:01.811
- I'm gonna need access.
- You'll have it. Two conditions.

08:01.846 --> 08:03.359
- Alright, name them.
- Doctor says

08:03.384 --> 08:04.914
she needs a break, you hightail it.

08:04.950 --> 08:06.694
And when you find the bastard who did

08:06.719 --> 08:08.484
this, you make sure no one else does.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.553
And you.

08:10.588 --> 08:14.223
Move your damn horse.

08:14.259 --> 08:17.193
- How long have you been here?
- Couple days.

08:17.228 --> 08:19.529
- Maybe a week?
- You had any visitors?

08:19.564 --> 08:22.765
- Seen any nurses, orderlies?
- Just Dr. Reggie.

08:22.801 --> 08:24.233
He's gonna fix us.

08:24.269 --> 08:26.869
OK, Bethany, we're in serious shit here.

08:26.905 --> 08:29.739
It's OK to feel
nervous before a surgery.

08:29.774 --> 08:32.241
This isn't a real hospital.

08:32.277 --> 08:34.501
- Reggie's not a real doctor.
- He cares about me.

08:34.501 --> 08:35.690
You know how long it's been

08:35.691 --> 08:37.547
since I could
actually say that about a man?

08:37.582 --> 08:39.006
Park your daddy issues, 'cause

08:39.032 --> 08:40.717
it's time to haul ass outta here.

08:40.751 --> 08:42.952
If he's not a doctor, he's...

08:42.988 --> 08:45.688
A serial killer.

08:45.724 --> 08:48.624
The good news is that you're not sick.

08:48.660 --> 08:52.061
The better news... Bethany.

08:52.097 --> 08:54.430
Better news is that we're leaving.

08:54.466 --> 08:57.934
OK? I'll need you to get
me a wheelchair, though.

09:03.141 --> 09:04.706
- Shit.
- He's coming back.

09:04.843 --> 09:07.810
- OK...
- What do I do?

09:07.846 --> 09:10.380
Run. Get help.

09:11.850 --> 09:15.051
Go!

09:15.086 --> 09:17.954
Bethany, no! Bethany!

09:17.989 --> 09:19.989
I'm not like you, Wynonna.

09:20.025 --> 09:22.625
- I'm not brave.
- No...

09:32.303 --> 09:35.805
Time for the doctor to go
to work.

10:32.497 --> 10:34.373
What're you doing?

10:35.934 --> 10:37.952
- Oh God, please don't...
- The doctor is

10:37.977 --> 10:39.893
gonna make you feel better, Bethany.

10:46.411 --> 10:49.145
She won't stabilize. I
can't lose another one!

10:49.180 --> 10:51.647
Come on, come on!

11:21.913 --> 11:24.046
It's OK. It's OK.

11:24.082 --> 11:26.282
I can fix the next one.

11:26.317 --> 11:28.351
I just know I can fix Wynonna.

11:29.826 --> 11:30.779
I know Deputy Earp

11:30.780 --> 11:33.016
is still out there, and we'll
continue the search,

11:33.052 --> 11:35.652
- but we agreed my Officer...
- Is our only witness.

11:35.688 --> 11:38.689
I need to question her before
her memory becomes more clouded

11:38.724 --> 11:40.220
- than it is.
- I'd feel more

11:40.245 --> 11:41.992
comfortable with a greenlight

11:42.027 --> 11:44.227
- from her doctor.
- Sheriff.

11:46.432 --> 11:48.365
I'm good.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.801
- OK? I want to help.
- Well,

11:50.836 --> 11:54.004
I'll swing by and make
sure that cat of yours is fed.

11:54.039 --> 11:56.640
She doesn't really like men.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.942
Well, who does?

12:00.179 --> 12:03.180
OK. So what was the last thing you saw?

12:03.215 --> 12:07.784
Waverly Earp, smiling at
me from her front porch.

12:07.820 --> 12:11.722
And, uh, a man stepping
out on the highway.

12:11.757 --> 12:14.057
- Flagging us down.
- Description?

12:14.093 --> 12:17.361
No. Just a blank space after that.

12:17.396 --> 12:19.696
Until the woods.

12:19.732 --> 12:22.232
- What happened?
- Somebody was carrying me.

12:22.267 --> 12:25.202
I was blindfolded, I think.

12:25.237 --> 12:26.837
Or just really drugged.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.706
Next thing I know I'm freezing cold,

12:29.742 --> 12:31.308
covered in dirt in a ditch

12:31.343 --> 12:33.977
- the side of the road.
- What about Wynonna?

12:34.013 --> 12:36.346
Do you remember anything

12:36.382 --> 12:38.315
- about Wynonna?
- No.

12:38.350 --> 12:41.651
- I couldn't see anything.
- Sight ain't your only sense,

12:41.687 --> 12:44.588
Ms. Haught.

12:46.692 --> 12:49.493
What did he smell like?

12:51.196 --> 12:52.781
Close your eyes. Take a deep

12:52.782 --> 12:55.732
breath in, let the memories come.

12:55.768 --> 12:58.168
Sour.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.453
- Musty.
- Like death?

13:02.478 --> 13:03.206
No.

13:03.242 --> 13:06.743
Spoiled fruit. And gasoline.

13:06.779 --> 13:08.711
- He kicked me.
- What?

13:08.712 --> 13:09.800
I couldn't figure out

13:09.801 --> 13:12.716
why my chest was hurting. He
threw me down and he said

13:12.751 --> 13:15.118
"You're the wrong kind."

13:15.154 --> 13:17.354
You're the wrong
kind. You're the wrong kind.

13:17.389 --> 13:19.389
You're the wrong kind. Uh...

13:19.425 --> 13:22.893
Serial killers, they, um,
often have a type of victim

13:22.928 --> 13:24.694
that they prefer.

13:24.730 --> 13:26.296
And Wynonna?

13:26.331 --> 13:29.266
Must be exactly what Jack's looking for.

13:29.301 --> 13:30.967
Waverly, I'm so sorry.

13:31.003 --> 13:34.171
No, it's fine. I'm just glad you're OK.

14:00.499 --> 14:03.567
Come on, toes... move.

14:42.774 --> 14:45.775
Now, now. You know she's
tougher than a boiled owl.

14:47.713 --> 14:50.180
He's got, like, a shitload of knives.

14:50.215 --> 14:52.449
- And she's got us.
- Ahem!

14:55.320 --> 14:57.120
Initial tests came
back from Nicole's uniform.

14:57.156 --> 14:58.989
Traces of ethyl alcohol.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.497
Yeah, the...
gasoline smell she remembered.

15:01.522 --> 15:02.626
Common by-product

15:02.661 --> 15:05.629
of chemical
manufacture. Like designer drugs.

15:05.664 --> 15:09.166
- Certain types of explosives.
- Sour fruit.

15:09.201 --> 15:11.067
- Excuse me?
- Nicole also said

15:11.103 --> 15:14.571
she smelled sour
fruit. As in fermented fruit.

15:14.606 --> 15:17.407
- Liquor.
- Ethyl isn't in liquor.

15:17.442 --> 15:19.809
Back in my day it
was. Bootleggers used it

15:19.845 --> 15:21.876
- to make moonshine.
- Doc, you're a genius!

15:21.991 --> 15:24.147
- Let's not get carried away.
- OK, I think I know where he has her.

15:24.183 --> 15:27.017
Right. Late 1930s,

15:27.052 --> 15:29.186
Purgatory gets a new
sewage system. Construction crew

15:29.221 --> 15:31.389
hits what they think is a sinkhole.

15:31.390 --> 15:32.884
They actually found a series of tunnels

15:32.909 --> 15:34.509
used during
prohibition to smuggle liquor

15:34.526 --> 15:37.093
- across the border.
- Prohibition?

15:37.129 --> 15:39.671
From 1919 to 1933 the United States

15:39.672 --> 15:40.764
banned the sale, the making

15:40.799 --> 15:43.700
- and consumption of alcohol.
- Lord, I'm almost glad

15:43.735 --> 15:45.902
- I was in the well for that.
- So Jack went from using

15:45.938 --> 15:47.737
caves to using those tunnels.

15:47.773 --> 15:50.774
- Does this map give their location?
- No, unfortunately.

15:50.809 --> 15:53.610
The town just sealed them
up. But I think I have an idea

15:53.645 --> 15:55.378
who might know where they are.

15:55.414 --> 15:58.481
OK, 1884, Wyatt killed

15:58.517 --> 16:00.642
a corrupt saloon
owner named James Byers.

16:00.667 --> 16:01.451
James Byers.

16:01.486 --> 16:03.309
Same name appears again

16:03.436 --> 16:06.456
in 1925 in connection with
a rumored liquor run.

16:06.491 --> 16:08.558
It could be two guys or...

16:08.594 --> 16:11.728
- Or a revenant.
- Aw, hell.

16:14.132 --> 16:16.633
- Let me guess. You knew him?
- I know him.

16:16.668 --> 16:18.568
Runs an operation in town.

16:18.604 --> 16:21.039
What kind of
operation are we talking about?

16:21.064 --> 16:21.972
The best kind,

16:22.007 --> 16:24.874
highly illegal.

16:27.579 --> 16:30.313
There are two rules to this,

16:30.349 --> 16:32.282
- Mr. Dolls.
- Let me guess.

16:32.317 --> 16:35.316
First rule of fight club,
never talk about fight club, right?

16:35.317 --> 16:37.040
Nobody talks about
it, how're fellas gonna

16:37.065 --> 16:38.722
know where it is? No, the first rule is,

16:38.757 --> 16:41.458
You never, ever bring the law.

16:41.493 --> 16:44.294
- And what's the second rule?
- Wait here. Boss is comin'.

16:44.329 --> 16:47.430
Oh...

16:47.466 --> 16:49.733
Ooh!

16:51.136 --> 16:54.137
What d'you think, human or revenant?
Kinda hard to tell.

16:54.172 --> 16:57.181
Well, Whiskey Jim
likes to mix it up. 'Course,

16:57.182 --> 16:58.272
the humans have no idea they're

16:58.297 --> 17:00.033
stepping into the ring with a demon.

17:00.034 --> 17:01.645
Adds a bit of whimsy

17:01.680 --> 17:05.015
to your typical
pugilistic festivities, no?

17:05.050 --> 17:07.483
Look who the cat dragged in.

17:07.519 --> 17:10.987
Whiskey Jim.

17:11.022 --> 17:12.955
Doc Holliday.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.858
You being here means one of two things.

17:15.894 --> 17:17.827
Either you got my 10K,

17:17.863 --> 17:20.763
- or you got a death wish.
- Of course,

17:20.799 --> 17:23.366
you owe him money.

17:23.402 --> 17:26.670
- Did I forget to mention that?
- Listen,

17:26.704 --> 17:29.606
this idiot doesn't have what
he owes you, but my division does.

17:29.641 --> 17:32.275
All in exchange for some information.
Is there a place

17:32.311 --> 17:35.812
- we can talk, Whiskey Jimmy?
- Bloody Black Badge?

17:35.847 --> 17:39.316
Rule number one, moron.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.827
Yo. What up, Doctor Murder?

17:50.862 --> 17:52.796
How are you feeling?

17:52.831 --> 17:56.833
Floaty. These drugs are
hella dope. And coming from me,

17:56.868 --> 17:59.969
- that's saying something.
- I need to ask you some questions

18:00.005 --> 18:02.505
- about your personal history.
- Cut the bullshit.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.407
I know who you are.

18:04.443 --> 18:06.937
The last of the Seven. Which
means I'm sure as shit

18:07.048 --> 18:08.870
- not telling you anything.
- You're awfully

18:08.895 --> 18:10.321
mouthy for a girl who just found out

18:10.322 --> 18:11.952
- she's paralyzed.
- Bethany hasn't come back.

18:11.977 --> 18:13.375
I'm just scared, OK?

18:13.376 --> 18:15.185
That's why it's
important to have a healthy

18:15.220 --> 18:17.754
and open patient-doctor dialogue.

18:21.259 --> 18:25.495
So tell me, Wynonna...

18:25.530 --> 18:28.765
Can you feel this?

18:30.769 --> 18:32.702
Nope.

18:32.738 --> 18:34.738
You could be giving me a pedicure.

18:42.965 --> 18:46.100
Good. Still,

18:46.136 --> 18:49.671
we should up your meds.

18:49.706 --> 18:53.641
The doctor just wants to understand
you. Don't you want

18:53.677 --> 18:57.011
- to be understood?
- I want to be on a beach in Hawaii

18:57.047 --> 18:59.314
with two very
impressionable cabana boys.

18:59.349 --> 19:03.651
Always with the
jokes. Tell me, Wynonna...

19:03.687 --> 19:05.853
What happened after you
killed your own father?

19:05.889 --> 19:08.956
I was committed. Put under
the care of a 'specialist'.

19:08.992 --> 19:11.526
Every time I told the
truth, I got a nice jolt

19:11.561 --> 19:13.161
of electric juice.

19:13.196 --> 19:16.297
- Was the shock therapy effective?
- Yeah.

19:16.333 --> 19:19.701
Made me good at poker and now I
don't have to shave my left leg.

19:19.736 --> 19:22.270
You use humor as a form of self-defence.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.974
I prefer my Buntline special.
What'd you do with Peacemaker?

19:27.010 --> 19:30.878
Get a good grip on it?

19:30.914 --> 19:32.413
Stings a little, don't it, Revenant?

19:42.459 --> 19:45.624
- Hey, that's mine.
- What is it doing over here?

19:45.625 --> 19:47.115
You must've snagged it on something

19:47.140 --> 19:48.730
when you wheeled me in. Give it back.

19:48.765 --> 19:50.832
Answer my questions

19:50.867 --> 19:53.668
- without any more guff.
- And you won't cut me open?

19:53.703 --> 19:57.105
Wynonna, we have to do the surgery.

19:57.140 --> 20:00.241
- For your own good.
- To fix me, yeah. Did you fix Bethany?

20:00.276 --> 20:02.308
The doctor has ensured that
she's in no more pain.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.688
What is with psychos and talking
in the third person?

20:04.689 --> 20:06.748
I'm not psycho!

20:06.783 --> 20:08.816
Fine, you're not
psycho. You're not psycho.

20:08.852 --> 20:11.085
You're delightful. Top notch.

20:11.121 --> 20:13.028
I'll answer whatever, OK?

20:13.189 --> 20:16.357
Just put my necklace back on me, please.

20:25.664 --> 20:28.002
On second thought, you're
not really in a position

20:28.037 --> 20:30.938
to do any bargaining, are you?

20:38.481 --> 20:40.415
OK, look, we just need the entrance

20:40.450 --> 20:42.450
to your old
bootlegging tunnels, that's it.

20:42.485 --> 20:45.486
Let's say I was willing
to help you. And I ain't.

20:45.522 --> 20:48.863
Those tunnels are of no
use to you or anyone.

20:49.013 --> 20:51.125
They were boarded up a long time ago.

20:51.161 --> 20:53.661
- Nobody knows how to find them.
- Well, somebody does.

20:53.696 --> 20:55.696
That 'someone'

20:55.732 --> 20:58.099
has a very sharp
blade and Bobo's backin'.

20:58.134 --> 21:02.336
- Ain't got nothin' to do with me.
- Look, just tell us where they are

21:02.372 --> 21:05.206
and we'll be on our
way, alright, Whiskey?

21:07.844 --> 21:10.344
This is my place.

21:10.380 --> 21:12.313
I do the asking.

21:12.348 --> 21:15.783
And you owe me plenty.

21:15.819 --> 21:18.186
Look, we are all businessmen here.

21:18.221 --> 21:20.154
Can't we come to some
sort of arrangement?

21:20.190 --> 21:22.857
Hmm...

21:24.828 --> 21:27.487
You do look like you
can handle yourself.

21:29.148 --> 21:31.766
Yeah, I do alright.

21:36.105 --> 21:38.039
Alright. You want my help?

21:38.074 --> 21:41.142
You two need to earn it. Here,

21:41.177 --> 21:43.344
now.

21:43.379 --> 21:45.379
In the ring.

21:45.415 --> 21:48.115
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You
really want me to fight him?

21:48.151 --> 21:49.741
- What, you yella?
- No, I'm being

21:49.766 --> 21:51.786
realistic, and let's
be real, you won't get

21:51.821 --> 21:54.088
- your money's worth.
- Oh, I'll take that bet.

21:54.123 --> 21:56.057
- Shut up.
- Whatever.

21:56.092 --> 21:58.092
Just make sure there's blood.

21:58.127 --> 22:00.394
Lots of it. One of you

22:00.430 --> 22:03.130
leaves on a stretcher, or neither
of you leaves at all.

22:03.166 --> 22:05.199
You give me that?

22:05.235 --> 22:08.069
I'll tell you where my tunnels are.

22:08.104 --> 22:09.737
Rule number two,

22:09.772 --> 22:13.407
don't come if you
ain't willing to fight.

22:24.587 --> 22:28.055
Wynonna!

22:28.091 --> 22:31.459
Wynonna!

22:44.474 --> 22:48.142
This fella's been looking for
a chance to give you this.

22:48.177 --> 22:50.611
Boss man sent him.

22:50.647 --> 22:52.780
I guess Bobo wants
you alive for something.

22:52.815 --> 22:55.349
You best read it quick.

22:58.191 --> 22:59.694
_

22:59.695 --> 23:00.877
_

23:00.877 --> 23:02.187
_

23:02.187 --> 23:03.572
_

23:11.267 --> 23:13.134
Dolls,

23:13.169 --> 23:15.870
you slimy motha...

23:15.905 --> 23:17.605
Place your bets, gents!

23:20.810 --> 23:24.078
Alright, let's go!

23:24.113 --> 23:26.681
Come on!

23:31.588 --> 23:34.855
- That's enough. It's showtime.
- Alright.

23:36.159 --> 23:38.893
OK, look, we're running out of time.

23:38.928 --> 23:41.295
Let's just give this guy what he wants.

23:41.331 --> 23:44.532
- We should make it look real.
- Who says it ain't?

23:48.871 --> 23:52.106
- Oof!
- Heh, heh!

23:52.141 --> 23:54.508
Alright, old-timer. Playtime's over.

24:10.860 --> 24:12.960
I see you've found my missing scalpel.

24:12.996 --> 24:14.593
Know how to make someone show you

24:14.618 --> 24:16.330
where something precious is hidden?

24:16.366 --> 24:19.033
Set fire to their house.

24:19.068 --> 24:21.502
It's the first thing they go for.

24:21.537 --> 24:23.638
Wynonna, don't be rash.

24:23.673 --> 24:26.974
You'll never find Officer
Haught without me.

24:27.010 --> 24:29.577
New deal, Reggimite.

24:29.612 --> 24:31.246
Tell me where she is, and I'll make

24:31.271 --> 24:32.880
your trip back to hell an express.

24:32.915 --> 24:35.616
Screw around, and I will have some fun

24:35.652 --> 24:38.453
before I blow your Revenant brains out.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.949
Hell?

24:40.256 --> 24:42.289
You killed Nicole,

24:42.325 --> 24:44.759
- didn't you, you sonuvabitch?
- No.

24:46.529 --> 24:49.563
Red blood? You're human.

24:58.508 --> 25:00.508
I'm sorry, Doctor.

25:00.543 --> 25:02.243
No need to say sorry, Reginald.

25:02.278 --> 25:05.713
You served your purpose.

25:05.748 --> 25:07.882
And now, you are released.

25:09.519 --> 25:11.485
Who are you?

25:11.521 --> 25:13.754
I've had a lot of names.

25:13.790 --> 25:15.923
But you can call me Jack.

26:01.938 --> 26:03.838
What happened to your shoulder, huh?

26:05.842 --> 26:09.210
I'm surprised you don't
know. It wasn't in your report?

26:21.591 --> 26:24.725
Yeah!

26:26.963 --> 26:30.297
How?!

26:32.368 --> 26:33.968
Who told you?

26:34.003 --> 26:36.070
Who gave it to you?

26:39.208 --> 26:41.475
You wanna poke and prod me for science?

26:41.511 --> 26:43.511
You wanna put me back in a cage?

26:43.546 --> 26:45.513
You are a dirty,

26:45.548 --> 26:47.848
two-faced son of a bitch liar.

26:47.884 --> 26:50.718
Ohh!

26:54.557 --> 26:57.258
What're you waiting
for!? Get up! One of you two

26:57.293 --> 27:00.161
needs to eat this
mat, or this deal's off!

27:00.196 --> 27:02.863
Wynonna will never forgive you

27:02.899 --> 27:04.732
if you hand me over to the authorities.

27:07.770 --> 27:09.703
You didn't help her when it mattered.

27:09.739 --> 27:12.339
She's with Jack because of you.

27:14.343 --> 27:16.577
No wonder why Wyatt left you to die.

27:31.661 --> 27:34.028
Winner!

27:39.569 --> 27:42.970
Ohh! You sir did give me

27:43.005 --> 27:46.207
one hell of a show. You killed him!

27:54.231 --> 27:56.098
We'll deal with his corpse.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.300
Much obliged.

27:58.336 --> 28:00.903
Now, I expect Black
Badge will be snooping around,

28:00.938 --> 28:02.905
asking about their missing agent.

28:02.940 --> 28:06.141
- I'd make myself scarce, ASAP.
- The entrance to the tunnels.

28:06.177 --> 28:08.177
Now, I promised him that information.

28:08.212 --> 28:10.613
- Him's dead...
- Now, goddammit!

28:16.988 --> 28:20.189
Well, you did give me
one helluva good show!

28:21.559 --> 28:24.560
That file Dolls had was classified.

28:24.595 --> 28:26.795
- How'd Bobo get it?
- We revenants

28:26.831 --> 28:29.098
are trapped inside the
Ghost River Triangle.

28:29.133 --> 28:32.768
But Bobo, his reach extends
far beyond that.

28:32.803 --> 28:35.604
He's got friends in
high places, that one.

28:37.441 --> 28:39.375
Oh, oh, oh!

28:39.410 --> 28:41.277
I, uh,

28:41.312 --> 28:43.245
got these off your dead friend.

28:43.281 --> 28:46.015
Don't think he'll be
needing them anymore.

29:02.300 --> 29:05.267
You needed a human to
handle Peacemaker for you.

29:18.382 --> 29:20.349
Somebody lost their head.

29:44.909 --> 29:47.710
- Jesus H. Christ!
- Nope.

29:47.745 --> 29:51.046
You weren't leaving without me, were ya?

29:54.852 --> 29:56.018
Never touch my stuff.

30:11.969 --> 30:13.936
Your nose is bleeding.

30:13.971 --> 30:15.971
Got a tampon?

30:16.007 --> 30:17.973
Or, you know,

30:18.009 --> 30:19.742
an inkling to get me to a real hospital?

30:19.777 --> 30:22.111
Wyatt's nose bled like
that when I first met him.

30:22.146 --> 30:25.447
I've been studying you for a long while.

30:25.483 --> 30:27.416
We are so alike.

30:27.451 --> 30:29.318
- Insane?
- No.

30:29.353 --> 30:31.037
You work with a team, not because you

30:31.062 --> 30:32.588
want to, but because you have to.

30:32.623 --> 30:36.125
Like me. And you prefer to hunt alone.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.526
Like me.

30:40.498 --> 30:42.498
This is a trick that Reginald taught me.

30:42.533 --> 30:44.500
Surgeons today

30:44.535 --> 30:46.298
like to draw a map on their patients

30:46.323 --> 30:47.870
for where they're going to cut.

30:47.905 --> 30:51.273
- Any chance this surgery is elective?
- It's mandatory, I'm afraid.

30:51.308 --> 30:54.943
Thought doctors had to
take an oath to do no harm.

30:54.979 --> 30:58.180
I've never really been a doctor.

30:58.215 --> 30:59.948
But I did study surgery.

30:59.984 --> 31:03.318
And by study, I mean, I
love to cut open bodies.

31:03.354 --> 31:05.187
I like to see what
makes people... people.

31:05.222 --> 31:07.523
See, even when I was human,

31:07.558 --> 31:09.491
I wasn't.

31:09.527 --> 31:11.593
Not way down deep.
- I owe Reggie

31:11.629 --> 31:13.896
an apology. You're the
sickest puppy in the litter.

31:13.931 --> 31:16.832
- Flattery's not gonna save you.
- What is your damage?

31:16.867 --> 31:19.535
Mommy didn't love you enough?

31:19.570 --> 31:21.810
Or is this because every
woman you ever met rejected you?

31:21.839 --> 31:24.873
Maybe.

31:24.909 --> 31:27.743
Your dime-store psychology

31:27.778 --> 31:30.212
is adorable, Wynonna.

31:30.247 --> 31:32.181
I love women.

31:32.216 --> 31:34.717
Can't you tell?

31:34.752 --> 31:37.853
Feast for the eyes. And every man

31:37.888 --> 31:39.888
has a favorite body part

31:39.924 --> 31:41.890
upon which to gaze.

31:41.926 --> 31:44.526
I love to
look at your organs.

31:44.562 --> 31:46.729
And I'm gonna keep you alive

31:46.764 --> 31:49.398
just long enough

31:49.433 --> 31:51.433
that you can look at them too.

31:54.313 --> 31:58.348
You dead, and now you are nuts.

31:58.349 --> 32:00.927
Oh, how the tables and have turned.

32:02.417 --> 32:05.565
Army Night Rangers. Elite
paramilitary unit.

32:05.600 --> 32:08.868
They train us in how to lower our
pulse, control our breathing.

32:08.904 --> 32:11.771
- Make the enemy think you're dead.
- Oh, aren't you

32:11.806 --> 32:13.791
- the master of deception.
- Here we go.

32:13.816 --> 32:14.707
If your bosses

32:14.743 --> 32:16.876
have no compunction about
turning a person

32:16.912 --> 32:19.412
into a pin cushion, how are
they better than the demons?

32:19.447 --> 32:22.115
Your body is a
treasure trove for science.

32:22.150 --> 32:24.083
Think about what the
military could do with soldiers

32:24.119 --> 32:26.953
who didn't get sick, didn't age?

32:26.988 --> 32:29.155
It was a decision made for
the good of the many.

32:29.190 --> 32:31.958
I get to choose who I share
my treasure trove with,

32:31.993 --> 32:33.927
not the goddamn government.

32:33.962 --> 32:35.828
If Wynonna

32:35.864 --> 32:38.498
wasn't in danger, I
would shoot you right now.

32:38.533 --> 32:40.226
Yeah. If Wynonna wasn't in danger,

32:40.251 --> 32:41.968
you would be in the back of a van.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.670
Hey, hey, hey! Watch it!

32:43.705 --> 32:45.687
Ooh! Easy now.

32:45.873 --> 32:50.843
I'm just gettin' ready.
But once Wynonna is safe...

32:50.879 --> 32:53.346
Yeah. Once Wynonna's safe.

32:54.683 --> 32:56.916
Now.

32:58.920 --> 33:01.487
How the hell do we get in there?

33:01.523 --> 33:04.357
Reginald always used antiseptic

33:04.392 --> 33:06.392
because he thought that there
was a chance that the patients

33:06.428 --> 33:08.361
would survive the procedure, but...

33:08.396 --> 33:10.563
let's not kid ourselves.

33:12.534 --> 33:14.000
You're not gonna survive this.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.603
Now...

33:16.638 --> 33:19.906
only the best for the heir.

33:19.941 --> 33:21.874
Wait!

33:21.910 --> 33:24.877
Before I die, just tell me.

33:24.913 --> 33:27.680
- Tell you what?
- Why.

33:27.716 --> 33:28.965
Why send the posse of seven?

33:28.990 --> 33:30.430
If Bobo really wanted my daddy dead,

33:30.452 --> 33:32.385
- he could've done it himself.
- Don't forget,

33:32.420 --> 33:35.321
it wasn't the posse that
killed dear old Ward.

33:35.357 --> 33:37.790
It was a scared and
confused little girl.

33:37.826 --> 33:41.394
- It was an accident.
- I know, I was there.

33:41.429 --> 33:44.163
I know you're not gonna believe this,
but I really liked your father.

33:44.199 --> 33:46.466
He wasn't like the other Earp heirs.

33:46.501 --> 33:49.669
He wasn't ambitious like Edwin,

33:49.704 --> 33:51.704
or courageous like Josiah,

33:51.740 --> 33:53.840
but he had something
that they didn't have.

33:53.875 --> 33:55.808
Wits.

33:55.844 --> 33:57.877
When Ward started his little ride,

33:57.912 --> 34:00.847
he realized that in order to survive,

34:00.882 --> 34:02.882
he was gonna have to
make certain alliances.

34:02.917 --> 34:05.485
- With who? Black Badge?
- Don't be daft.

34:05.520 --> 34:08.087
He made a pact with the big man himself.

34:08.123 --> 34:10.123
Bobo Del Rey.

34:12.761 --> 34:15.995
No. My daddy would never make a deal

34:16.031 --> 34:19.532
- with a demon. Never.
- They were very close friends.

34:19.567 --> 34:22.402
Liar.

34:23.804 --> 34:26.272
I'm sorry, Wynonna, that
I break your heart.

34:27.409 --> 34:29.275
Now I'm going to cut it out.

34:29.310 --> 34:31.678
No! No!

34:34.049 --> 34:36.303
- Took you long enough.
- You're welcome.

34:36.328 --> 34:37.216
Doc Holliday.

34:37.252 --> 34:39.518
I always hoped that I'd
have this pleasure.

34:48.429 --> 34:50.929
Where did you get the
Stone Witch's trinket?

34:56.004 --> 34:58.071
Normally I just carve up women,

34:58.106 --> 35:00.406
but, Doctor, in your case I'm
gonna make an exception.

35:00.442 --> 35:03.843
Looks like it's just
me and you, Jackie Boy.

35:18.359 --> 35:20.535
- Go! Go get it.
- Peacemaker?

35:20.560 --> 35:21.260
Yeah.

35:21.296 --> 35:22.962
It's across the hall. Whisky barrels.

35:22.997 --> 35:25.698
Quick! OK.

35:51.359 --> 35:53.192
Did I get him?

35:53.228 --> 35:54.794
Not your job.

35:54.829 --> 35:57.330
Oh!

35:57.365 --> 35:59.599
It just got a little wet.

35:59.634 --> 36:03.469
Mmm. Oak-aged.

36:03.505 --> 36:06.706
Thank you. Don't kill each other.

36:08.977 --> 36:10.343
Alright...

36:12.447 --> 36:14.213
- So.
- Yep.

36:14.249 --> 36:17.416
- Good talk.
- Oh, we are done talkin'.

36:20.784 --> 36:23.703
I think this would be a
good juncture to remind you

36:23.704 --> 36:27.755
that I am the fastest
gunslinger that ever walked the earth.

36:27.790 --> 36:29.824
Hm. Debatable. What about Billy the Kid?

36:29.859 --> 36:31.792
Ooh, I should shoot you right now,

36:31.828 --> 36:34.428
just for being such an
obstreperous jackass.

36:34.464 --> 36:37.098
So go ahead. Take me out.

36:37.133 --> 36:40.028
Just know they've got satellites.
Predator drones.

36:40.153 --> 36:41.554
You look like you just came out of the

36:41.579 --> 36:43.171
Grand Ole Opry, so
they will find you, Doc.

36:43.206 --> 36:45.973
And you, sir, are an asshole.

36:46.009 --> 36:48.442
But you are not a villain.

36:48.478 --> 36:50.912
So why, Dolls?

36:52.916 --> 36:56.017
It was you. Or her.

36:59.589 --> 37:01.589
I see.

37:03.593 --> 37:06.360
D'you know what Wyatt used
to say? He used to say,

37:06.396 --> 37:09.664
'Doc, well, if you stand for nothing,

37:09.699 --> 37:12.200
you are sure to fall.'

37:12.235 --> 37:13.868
What was I supposed to do?

37:13.903 --> 37:16.971
You do what you do best, Deputy
Marshal Dolls, you fight.

37:21.377 --> 37:23.377
OK.

37:28.851 --> 37:32.320
Well, that was easy.

38:08.124 --> 38:11.926
Just think about it. Think about it.

38:11.961 --> 38:13.861
Think about it.

38:13.896 --> 38:15.930
I'm the last of the Seven.

38:15.965 --> 38:19.133
What happens when you kill me?

38:19.168 --> 38:21.535
Order too much Thai

38:21.571 --> 38:23.904
and open a bottle of wine?

38:23.940 --> 38:25.940
Once I'm gone,

38:25.975 --> 38:28.542
you'll have to deal with
the puppet master.

38:28.578 --> 38:31.302
And Bobo Del Rey

38:31.498 --> 38:34.436
makes the rest of us
look like choir boys.

38:34.462 --> 38:35.416
Yeah.

38:35.451 --> 38:38.719
But he'll still make the
same pathetic hissing sound

38:38.755 --> 38:42.056
- when I shoot him between the eyes.
- You're talking tough,

38:42.091 --> 38:45.593
but you're just like me. You're broken.

38:45.628 --> 38:48.829
I can hear the fear in your voice.

38:55.204 --> 38:58.172
Oh, I wish I could stay!

39:00.176 --> 39:02.510
Watch what's coming next.

39:02.545 --> 39:04.578
A reunion...

39:04.614 --> 39:06.647
an escape.

39:06.683 --> 39:08.716
So much blood.

39:08.751 --> 39:10.951
You attacked my home

39:10.987 --> 39:14.155
and killed my sister.

39:14.190 --> 39:17.291
- Now make your peace.
- What's the hurry, little girl?

39:17.327 --> 39:20.828
Enjoy the moment.

39:20.863 --> 39:22.663
- Savor the kill.
- Who's this,

39:22.699 --> 39:25.032
you do impressions now?
Who is that, Judi Dench?

39:25.068 --> 39:27.568
You've solved a great mystery.

39:27.603 --> 39:29.637
Succeeded where Scotland Yard failed,

39:29.672 --> 39:31.909
and all

39:32.016 --> 39:34.275
by your lonesome.

39:36.512 --> 39:38.713
I ain't interested.

39:38.748 --> 39:41.849
And I'm not lonesome.

39:41.884 --> 39:45.586
I just prefer to hunt alone.

40:43.246 --> 40:46.213
You have to let go sometime, Waves.

40:48.184 --> 40:50.985
Maybe tomorrow.

40:57.627 --> 40:59.627
Well,

40:59.662 --> 41:01.796
just like that, the Seven are gone.

41:01.831 --> 41:04.732
Just like that, huh?

41:07.003 --> 41:09.303
So what now?

41:12.108 --> 41:14.341
Wynonna?

41:23.986 --> 41:25.508
You stand by this report?

41:25.643 --> 41:27.590
That your Deputy possibly dispatched

41:27.591 --> 41:29.757
the most notorious serial
killer in history?

41:29.898 --> 41:32.126
I said possibly. There's no way
to prove it without a body.

41:32.161 --> 41:35.362
How convenient. Where's my delivery?

41:35.398 --> 41:39.009
Oh yeah. I will be formally withdrawing
the report I filed

41:39.010 --> 41:40.723
on the alleged target. Henry is nothing

41:40.724 --> 41:43.070
but a con artist. A good one, but...

41:43.105 --> 41:45.506
- the real Doc Holliday is dead.
- You continue

41:45.541 --> 41:46.807
to disappoint me.

41:55.518 --> 41:58.115
As long as I keep surprising you.

41:58.487 --> 42:01.088
Always.

42:07.964 --> 42:09.930
I've acquired a local asset.

42:09.966 --> 42:12.700
A revenant from within Bobo
Del Rey's inner circle.

42:12.735 --> 42:16.537
Trusted lieutenant.

42:17.236 --> 42:20.990
I will test the limits of
his physical body. And his mind.

42:20.991 --> 42:22.977
No method will be spared.

42:23.012 --> 42:26.146
After all, there's no danger
of him dying on me... at least,

42:26.182 --> 42:27.948
not permanently.

42:31.187 --> 42:33.621
Seems there's a mole in
my organization, Jim.

42:33.656 --> 42:36.095
And you are going to help me find them.
