01:01.570 --> 01:03.570
<i>On days like this,</i>

01:03.572 --> 01:06.740
<i>I feel like the luckiest dog
in the world.</i>

01:06.742 --> 01:08.709
<i>I got the sun on my back.</i>

01:08.711 --> 01:10.878
<i>I got the wind in my face.</i>

01:10.880 --> 01:12.880
<i>I get to ride in this car</i>

01:12.882 --> 01:15.551
<i>where the windows are
always rolled down.</i>

01:19.588 --> 01:22.723
<i>My name is Bailey.</i>

01:22.725 --> 01:24.858
You enjoying the breeze, boy?

01:24.860 --> 01:27.061
- <i>I love my boy Ethan.</i>
- Boss Dog.

01:27.063 --> 01:29.530
<i>And I love my girl Hannah, too.</i>

01:29.532 --> 01:30.864
Boss Dog. Boss Man.

01:30.866 --> 01:32.566
<i>I've lived a lot of lives,</i>

01:32.568 --> 01:34.735
<i>and I've peed
on a lot of stuff.</i>

01:34.737 --> 01:36.303
<i>There is one thing</i>

01:36.305 --> 01:38.672
<i>I've never been able
to figure out, though:</i>

01:38.674 --> 01:40.874
<i>Why does it always itch
right here?</i>

01:42.611 --> 01:43.877
Baby can come up.

01:43.879 --> 01:45.746
Baby can come up here.

01:45.748 --> 01:47.681
That's my cue.

01:47.683 --> 01:52.052
I'll meet you in the kitchen
after I do the chores.

02:02.765 --> 02:05.799
You as creaky as me, Boss Dog?

02:05.801 --> 02:07.901
Let's go.

02:07.903 --> 02:10.770
- Come on.
- <i>Mornings had the best smells.</i>

02:14.944 --> 02:17.678
<i>Sure, we had to do
our chores...</i>

02:19.648 --> 02:21.782
Come on, Bailey.

02:23.786 --> 02:25.052
<i>...but it always ended
with an egg.</i>

02:26.355 --> 02:28.057
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:36.599 --> 02:38.034
Seriously?

02:44.673 --> 02:45.941
Hey, buddy.

02:47.977 --> 02:50.944
Still think you got one in you,
Boss Dog?

02:57.219 --> 02:59.155
Okay.

03:07.163 --> 03:08.829
You ready?

03:08.831 --> 03:10.097
<i>Born ready.</i>

03:10.099 --> 03:11.899
One.

03:11.901 --> 03:13.167
Two.

03:14.637 --> 03:15.638
Three. Go!

03:21.844 --> 03:23.744
Way to go, Boss Dog.

03:23.746 --> 03:26.013
<i>Ugh, that isn't
getting any easier.</i>

03:26.015 --> 03:28.816
That isn't getting any easier.

03:34.857 --> 03:35.989
Hey.

03:35.991 --> 03:37.925
You still got it, Boss Dog.

03:37.927 --> 03:39.993
Yeah. Yeah.

03:39.995 --> 03:41.664
Good boy.

03:42.798 --> 03:45.866
Come on, let's go to the house.

03:45.868 --> 03:48.202
Come on, buddy. Come on.

03:48.204 --> 03:50.003
Come on.

03:50.005 --> 03:52.673
<i>Come on, bacon. Come on, bacon.</i>

03:54.877 --> 03:57.277
<i>Eh, it's not bacon,
but I'll take it.</i>

03:59.882 --> 04:01.682
- Morning.
- Morning.

04:01.684 --> 04:03.984
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi.

04:03.986 --> 04:06.019
Morning, Gloria.

04:06.021 --> 04:08.021
What time did she wake up,
Hannah?

04:08.023 --> 04:09.756
Oh, wasn't looking
at the clock.

04:09.758 --> 04:10.991
Doesn't matter, though.

04:10.993 --> 04:12.960
We're having fun
with our granddaughter.

04:12.962 --> 04:15.129
<i>Hannah used to have
a boy named Henry.</i>

04:15.131 --> 04:17.029
<i>He brought Gloria
into our pack.</i>

04:17.031 --> 04:21.168
We keep feeding her pancakes,
she's gonna get chubby.

04:21.170 --> 04:24.104
<i>Maybe this time
she'll give me a treat.</i>

04:24.106 --> 04:26.206
<i>No? No treat? Okay.</i>

04:26.208 --> 04:29.977
I thought little babies
were supposed to be chubby.

04:29.979 --> 04:32.913
Ethan, shh.

04:32.915 --> 04:35.949
<i>Hannah made that
"shh" sound a lot lately.</i>

04:35.951 --> 04:37.251
- Who's that?
- Daddy.

04:37.253 --> 04:39.987
Daddy. You know, I think
she has Henry's eyes.

04:39.989 --> 04:42.189
<i>Henry went away
and never came back.</i>

04:42.191 --> 04:44.291
<i>Hannah cried a lot.</i>

04:44.293 --> 04:46.026
<i>I licked her face a lot.</i>

04:46.028 --> 04:47.794
I wish my son was alive

04:47.796 --> 04:49.263
to see his adorable daughter.

04:49.265 --> 04:50.797
Aw.

04:50.799 --> 04:51.899
Oh...

04:51.901 --> 04:53.967
<i>She drops it, I eat it.</i>

04:53.969 --> 04:55.969
- <i>That's our deal.</i>
- Oh, it fell.

04:58.274 --> 05:01.141
Orange. Purple.

05:01.143 --> 05:04.011
<i>Gloria liked
to wear food on her face.</i>

05:05.848 --> 05:08.182
- <i>But not good food.</i>
- Hello?

05:08.184 --> 05:11.519
A... a gross dog
just licked my face.

05:11.521 --> 05:12.986
No, no,
that's-that's how it goes

05:12.988 --> 05:14.188
when you're stuck on a farm.

05:14.190 --> 05:15.523
<i>CJ, where are you going?</i>

05:15.525 --> 05:17.525
<i>We're supposed to play here.</i>

05:17.527 --> 05:19.326
What's happening in Chicago?

05:19.328 --> 05:21.030
Tell me everything.
Go away.

05:22.331 --> 05:24.965
Are you guys going out?

05:31.974 --> 05:33.776
I see the horsey.

05:44.253 --> 05:45.553
<i>No, don't go in there.</i>

05:55.331 --> 05:57.231
<i>CJ, stop.</i>

06:05.808 --> 06:07.941
He's scary.

06:10.145 --> 06:11.245
Whoa, boy. Whoa.

06:18.354 --> 06:20.153
<i>From the way he was breathing,</i>

06:20.155 --> 06:21.589
<i>I knew Ethan was scared.</i>

06:21.591 --> 06:23.023
Yeah.

06:23.025 --> 06:24.358
I don't know. I feel like...

06:24.360 --> 06:25.926
What are you doing?

06:25.928 --> 06:27.595
Hey, let me call you back.

06:27.597 --> 06:30.397
CJ just got in with Linus.

06:30.399 --> 06:32.266
Hey, come here.

06:32.268 --> 06:34.201
She could have been hurt,
Gloria.

06:34.203 --> 06:36.604
Bailey saved her.

06:36.606 --> 06:38.138
Let me get this straight.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.274
It's one of those hero dogs
you see on TV?

06:40.276 --> 06:42.276
Its name is Bailey.

06:42.278 --> 06:45.045
<i>I love when my boy Ethan says my name.</i>

06:45.047 --> 06:47.116
Go inside.

06:48.317 --> 06:51.020
I know what you did, Boss Dog.

06:52.354 --> 06:54.156
Come on.

06:58.193 --> 07:01.194
<i>I don't know where
Gloria found this baby,</i>

07:01.196 --> 07:03.297
<i>but it is a great addition.</i>

07:03.299 --> 07:05.032
CJ is smart and curious.

07:05.034 --> 07:07.334
We just have to keep
an eye on her.

07:07.336 --> 07:09.369
Well, I turned my back
for two seconds.

07:09.371 --> 07:11.204
More like two years.

07:11.206 --> 07:13.073
CJ.

07:13.075 --> 07:14.374
- Come on, CJ.
- No.

07:14.376 --> 07:17.077
- Clarity. Clarity June.
- Nana, Nana.

07:17.079 --> 07:19.379
Hey, Mama's here now.
Can you say "Mama"?

07:19.381 --> 07:20.648
Nana, Nana.

07:20.650 --> 07:22.916
All right.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.955
Oh, Clarity June,
that is not funny.

07:28.957 --> 07:30.658
It's kind of funny.

07:30.660 --> 07:33.226
<i>Why doesn't anyone
ever wipe food on my face?</i>

07:37.232 --> 07:40.100
<i>After all
the excitement of the day,</i>

07:40.102 --> 07:43.337
<i>I had to cool off
in the big water bowl.</i>

07:43.339 --> 07:44.971
- Hey.
- You know what that is.

07:44.973 --> 07:46.373
You having fun yet?

07:46.375 --> 07:48.241
Oh! Grand...

07:48.243 --> 07:50.243
Grandpa.
Oh... oh, my goodness.

07:50.245 --> 07:52.212
I-I leave her with you
for a couple hours,

07:52.214 --> 07:54.414
and you have Clarity bathing
with a filthy dog?

07:54.416 --> 07:56.450
<i>Finally, Gloria wants to play.</i>

07:56.452 --> 07:58.485
Well, they're just playing.

07:58.487 --> 08:00.120
All right, get-get out.
Get out, dog.

08:00.122 --> 08:01.188
Oh, come on.

08:01.190 --> 08:02.989
They're just having fun.

08:02.991 --> 08:04.191
You know what?

08:04.193 --> 08:05.526
Don't worry, honey.
Mommy's here.

08:05.528 --> 08:06.561
Come on. It's okay.

08:06.563 --> 08:08.997
<i>Oh, I get what
you want me to do.</i>

08:10.933 --> 08:13.033
Oh!

08:14.236 --> 08:16.937
This is why I don't like dogs.

08:16.939 --> 08:20.042
<i>Maybe you wanted
to stick your nose in my butt?</i>

08:22.444 --> 08:25.011
Gloria is just
so young to be a widow.

08:25.013 --> 08:28.048
Eight months pregnant when
Henry was in that car accident.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.016
I know, honey. I know.

08:30.018 --> 08:33.520
But, Hannah,
where's her maternal instinct?

08:33.523 --> 08:35.523
Gloria's just trying
to figure out

08:35.525 --> 08:38.191
how she's gonna make a life
for herself and CJ.

08:38.193 --> 08:40.528
But she's got Henry's
insurance settlement.

08:40.530 --> 08:43.429
Well, that money's been set
aside for CJ's college fund.

08:43.432 --> 08:46.433
You're the one that raised
two kids, not me.

08:46.435 --> 08:49.236
So, if you're not worried
about it,

08:49.238 --> 08:51.271
I'm not worried about it.

08:51.273 --> 08:53.273
I'd be worried
if they weren't here.

08:53.275 --> 08:55.308
- Yeah.
- <i>Mm-hmm. Yeah.</i>

08:55.310 --> 08:56.577
<i>Up, up, up. There we go.</i>

08:56.579 --> 08:58.211
<i>Yeah, right in the middle.</i>

08:58.213 --> 09:00.280
<i>Now slide it down.
Slide it down. Yeah.</i>

09:00.282 --> 09:02.215
Between the three of us,
I think we can

09:02.217 --> 09:04.453
give that little girl
the love that she needs.

09:05.555 --> 09:07.022
<i>Ouch!</i>

09:08.190 --> 09:11.024
- What is that?
- What?

09:11.026 --> 09:12.560
It's a lump.

09:12.562 --> 09:14.461
Big lump.

09:14.463 --> 09:17.330
<i>Oh, please stop poking
that spot on my belly.</i>

09:17.332 --> 09:19.032
I'm gonna take him to the vet.

09:19.034 --> 09:20.601
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

09:20.603 --> 09:23.236
Hey, buddy. Hi, Bailey.

09:25.775 --> 09:28.074
<i>Somehow, Ethan always knows</i>

09:28.076 --> 09:30.145
<i>when I want to take a car ride.</i>

09:47.296 --> 09:49.364
Hey, Boss Dog.

09:51.433 --> 09:55.235
I want you to stay put,
okay, buddy?

09:55.237 --> 09:58.575
Dr. Deb said we should just
keep you comfortable.

10:00.643 --> 10:03.178
I can handle all the chores.

10:35.277 --> 10:38.546
<i>I had bad days,
and I had good days.</i>

10:38.548 --> 10:40.413
- <i>Today was a good day.</i>
- Well, me, too.

10:40.415 --> 10:43.684
Well, I finally got a call from
the, um... the cruise line.

10:43.686 --> 10:46.587
<i>Gloria spent a lot
of time talking to her hand.</i>

10:46.589 --> 10:49.557
And they needed a singer
for their Stagecoach Lounge.

10:49.559 --> 10:51.458
- Doggy, doggy, doggy.
- I know.

10:51.460 --> 10:54.294
<i>Um...
there's nothing in that cup.</i>

10:54.296 --> 10:55.563
Oh, did you make me a cup?

10:55.565 --> 10:57.565
- Here, Nana.
- Thank you.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.266
Well, it's perfect
for me, right?

10:59.268 --> 11:01.101
Mm!

11:01.103 --> 11:03.303
- Delicious.
- That delicious?

11:03.305 --> 11:05.171
<i>Wait, there was
something in that cup?</i>

11:05.173 --> 11:06.607
Yeah, they went with
a singer who, uh,

11:06.609 --> 11:08.441
does not have a toddler.

11:08.443 --> 11:10.176
I don't know.

11:10.178 --> 11:12.312
Maybe I should come back
to Chicago.

11:12.314 --> 11:13.548
- More?
- Yeah, but I don't

11:13.550 --> 11:15.083
really know what more I can do.

11:16.184 --> 11:18.586
Hey.

11:18.588 --> 11:21.288
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:23.458 --> 11:28.261
Getting her to go down
for her nap took forever.

11:28.263 --> 11:29.630
- You know, Gloria...
- Mm-hmm?

11:29.632 --> 11:33.601
Um, if-if you want
to pursue your career,

11:33.603 --> 11:36.573
you could leave Clarity
here with us.

11:38.741 --> 11:41.174
You think I'm a bad mother?

11:41.176 --> 11:42.743
What?

11:42.745 --> 11:46.446
Gloria... no, that's not
what I'm saying.

11:46.448 --> 11:48.415
Are you trying to take
my-my baby from me?

11:48.417 --> 11:50.383
'Cause my baby is all I have.

11:50.385 --> 11:52.620
Gloria, she's making you
an incredible offer.

11:52.622 --> 11:54.722
I know what this is about.

11:54.724 --> 11:56.222
You want Henry's settlement.

11:56.224 --> 11:57.625
I-I-I knew you wanted
that money

11:57.627 --> 12:00.260
so you can fix
this crumbling farm.

12:00.262 --> 12:01.494
This farm is not crumbling.

12:01.496 --> 12:02.630
<i>Ethan was mad.</i>

12:02.632 --> 12:05.933
<i>I hadn't heard him talk
like that in a long time.</i>

12:05.935 --> 12:07.568
It has nothing to do
with the money.

12:07.570 --> 12:10.203
It has to do with providing
a loving home for CJ.

12:10.205 --> 12:11.739
Well, Hannah, I am her mother.

12:11.741 --> 12:13.641
So, wherever I am,
that is her home.

12:13.643 --> 12:17.377
And okay, wow, obviously,
I'm not welcome here.

12:17.379 --> 12:18.946
You are always welcome here.

12:18.948 --> 12:20.514
So you can keep telling me
all the things

12:20.516 --> 12:21.682
I'm doing wrong
every single day?

12:21.684 --> 12:24.384
No, thank you. It's actually
not what I need right now.

12:24.386 --> 12:25.720
Well, what about CJ?
What about what she needs?

12:25.722 --> 12:26.687
Do you ever think about that?

12:26.689 --> 12:28.457
Does anyone ever think
about what I need?!

12:33.395 --> 12:36.296
<i>There was trouble in the pack.</i>

12:36.298 --> 12:39.265
<i>Somebody must have eaten
Gloria's food.</i>

12:39.267 --> 12:41.267
Gloria, please don't leave.

12:41.269 --> 12:43.604
Let's talk about this.
We can work it out.

12:43.606 --> 12:45.673
Whatever it takes.
Please, we can work this out.

12:45.675 --> 12:49.476
You don't seem to understand.
She's my baby, not yours.

12:49.478 --> 12:52.580
Ethan, what are we gonna do?

12:52.582 --> 12:55.315
Gloria.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.784
Hey, Gloria.

12:56.786 --> 12:58.819
<i>Such sadness from Hannah.</i>

12:58.821 --> 13:00.688
- Nana.
- Love you.

13:00.690 --> 13:03.758
<i>Sad like she was after
her boy stopped coming around.</i>

13:03.760 --> 13:07.260
Listen, we want you
to have some money.

13:07.262 --> 13:08.796
No, thanks.

13:08.798 --> 13:11.364
It's for CJ.
Would you just take it?

13:14.504 --> 13:16.537
And let us know
where you wind up.

13:16.539 --> 13:19.174
It's the least you could do.

13:21.010 --> 13:22.645
Gloria.

13:25.347 --> 13:27.615
Bye-bye, CJ!

13:27.617 --> 13:29.382
Love you!

13:29.384 --> 13:31.351
<i>I wanted to chase the car</i>

13:31.353 --> 13:33.353
<i>for Hannah and Ethan, but...</i>

13:33.355 --> 13:37.625
<i>but I just didn't have
the energy.</i>

13:37.627 --> 13:39.595
I know.

13:49.806 --> 13:53.607
<i>I wanted to eat
to make Ethan happy,</i>

13:53.609 --> 13:55.843
<i>but I wasn't hungry anymore.</i>

13:55.845 --> 14:00.313
<i>It was really quiet
after CJ left.</i>

14:00.315 --> 14:02.750
She'll get in touch with us.

14:02.752 --> 14:04.484
Eventually.

14:04.486 --> 14:06.587
It's a little cool

15:17.660 --> 15:18.959
Hey.

15:18.961 --> 15:23.496
I came out here
and found him laying here.

15:23.498 --> 15:25.433
He's in a lot of pain.

15:26.536 --> 15:29.970
I think it's time.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.675
You've done everything
you could for him.

15:35.144 --> 15:36.846
Do you want a moment?

15:45.154 --> 15:46.854
Bailey.

15:46.856 --> 15:48.823
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

15:48.825 --> 15:51.625
You're my good boy.

15:51.627 --> 15:54.829
We had such good times
together, didn't we?

15:54.831 --> 15:57.565
Mm, mm.

15:57.567 --> 16:00.935
You've done so much for me.

16:00.937 --> 16:05.573
You think maybe
next time you... you come back,

16:05.575 --> 16:08.609
you can come back for CJ,
you think?

16:09.946 --> 16:13.413
She needs you
like I needed you.

16:13.415 --> 16:15.883
You can protect her.

16:15.885 --> 16:21.421
And you make her feel happy
like you made me feel happy.

16:21.423 --> 16:23.958
<i>I didn't understand
all the words,</i>

16:23.960 --> 16:27.597
<i>but somehow,
I knew what Ethan meant.</i>

16:34.003 --> 16:36.503
- Are you ready, Ethan?
- Yeah.

16:36.505 --> 16:39.039
- All right, champ. Here we go.
- Yeah.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.542
- Good boy.
- You're not gonna hurt anymore.

16:41.544 --> 16:44.444
<i>I remember this from before.</i>

16:44.446 --> 16:47.781
<i>A tiny sting...</i>

16:47.783 --> 16:49.917
<i>and then my pain melted away.</i>

16:49.919 --> 16:52.922
Yeah, Boss Dog. Yeah, bud.

17:06.702 --> 17:09.737
Who's the Boss Dog, hmm?

17:09.739 --> 17:11.574
You the Boss Dog?

17:13.541 --> 17:15.910
I love you, Bailey.

17:15.912 --> 17:19.515
Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.887
<i>All my pain was gone.</i>

17:26.888 --> 17:30.557
<i>I was in this place,
and it was wonderful.</i>

17:30.559 --> 17:33.894
<i>Ethan gave me a new purpose.</i>

17:33.896 --> 17:36.830
<i>I was going to protect CJ.</i>

17:36.832 --> 17:41.003
<i>And I would never stop looking
until I found her.</i>

17:47.576 --> 17:49.944
<i>I was a puppy again.</i>

17:49.946 --> 17:52.112
<i>I had a mother
and brothers and sisters.</i>

17:52.114 --> 17:55.983
<i>Ugh, why are there always
seven puppies and six nipples?</i>

17:55.985 --> 17:57.851
Don't you worry, mama dog.

17:57.853 --> 17:59.687
I'm finding good homes for

17:59.689 --> 18:02.990
every single one
of your cuties.

18:02.992 --> 18:04.558
<i>But it felt like something</i>

18:04.560 --> 18:05.859
<i>was missing this time.</i>

18:05.861 --> 18:06.994
<i>Let's see.</i>

18:06.996 --> 18:08.796
<i>I have ears, pretty long ones.</i>

18:08.798 --> 18:10.831
<i>I have a tail.
I have a snout.</i>

18:10.833 --> 18:13.300
<i>I wonder if I have a...</i>

18:13.302 --> 18:16.537
<i>Nope.
I'm a girl this time.</i>

18:16.539 --> 18:18.539
<i>It was so great
being a puppy again.</i>

18:18.541 --> 18:21.075
<i>I got to play and play
and-and play.</i>

18:22.878 --> 18:25.312
<i>There was an old dog
named Mr. Churchill.</i>

18:25.314 --> 18:26.981
<i>He was a lot of fun.</i>

18:27.917 --> 18:31.652
They're a real handful,
eh, Mr. Churchill?

18:31.654 --> 18:35.589
<i>One by one, people took
my brothers and sisters away.</i>

18:35.591 --> 18:38.625
<i>All that was left
was my favorite brother.</i>

18:38.627 --> 18:42.029
<i>I was called Molly,
and he was called Rocky.</i>

18:49.939 --> 18:53.674
<i>Then, one day,
the worst thing happened.</i>

18:53.676 --> 18:55.709
<i>Rocky was going away.</i>

18:55.711 --> 18:57.711
<i>Who was I gonna play with?</i>

18:57.713 --> 19:01.015
- Aw.
- You look perfect together.

19:01.017 --> 19:02.518
<i>Huh?</i>

19:04.020 --> 19:05.652
<i>That girl.</i>

19:05.654 --> 19:08.956
<i>There's something
about that girl.</i>

19:08.958 --> 19:12.659
<i>I smell something familiar.</i>

19:12.661 --> 19:14.995
<i>It smells like...</i>

19:16.365 --> 19:17.965
<i>CJ!</i>

19:17.967 --> 19:20.067
<i>I remember my purpose!
CJ is my purpose!</i>

19:20.069 --> 19:22.169
<i>I can't let her get away.</i>

19:22.171 --> 19:23.804
<i>I'm coming, CJ!</i>

19:27.777 --> 19:29.678
<i>I can't let Ethan down.</i>

19:30.980 --> 19:32.980
<i>Got to get to CJ.</i>

19:34.150 --> 19:35.949
<i>I got this.</i>

19:35.951 --> 19:37.951
<i>I got this.
I got this. I got this.</i>

19:37.953 --> 19:40.020
<i>Oh, I don't got this.</i>

19:40.022 --> 19:42.656
I'm so happy you and Rocky
are a good match.

19:42.658 --> 19:44.224
He's already my best friend.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.994
<i>I'm coming, CJ!</i>

19:46.996 --> 19:49.196
<i>Ugh, this house has
too many fences.</i>

19:49.198 --> 19:51.165
<i>CJ, it's me!</i>

19:51.167 --> 19:52.733
<i>I-I'm here to protect you.</i>

19:54.203 --> 19:55.969
Whoa, psycho puppy.

19:55.971 --> 19:58.674
<i>CJ was a gigantic baby now.</i>

19:59.942 --> 20:02.876
This puppy is insane.

20:02.878 --> 20:04.244
That's Molly.

20:04.246 --> 20:07.014
She and her brother
are inseparable.

20:07.016 --> 20:09.685
Would your family consider
adopting both of them?

20:10.753 --> 20:11.985
I got this.

20:20.996 --> 20:22.796
Think I better get out of here

20:22.798 --> 20:25.666
before they change their minds
about getting one dog.

20:25.668 --> 20:27.801
<i>Mm, salt, milk.</i>

20:27.803 --> 20:30.003
- <i>Oh, hamburger. Mm.</i>
- How about you?

20:30.005 --> 20:32.239
Do you think your parents
would let you have a puppy?

20:32.241 --> 20:35.776
My mom does love dogs.

20:35.778 --> 20:36.879
She does?

20:38.047 --> 20:40.747
I'm gonna stop talking.

20:40.749 --> 20:43.717
I know what to do.
I'll take Molly home,

20:43.719 --> 20:47.754
my mom will go crazy for her,
and then she can call you.

20:47.756 --> 20:49.191
- Well...
- Well...

21:02.204 --> 21:03.971
- Shh.
- <i>Ah, that's the same</i>

21:03.973 --> 21:05.472
<i>"shh" sound Hannah always made.</i>

21:05.474 --> 21:07.174
<i>I never know what it means.</i>

21:07.176 --> 21:08.976
Clarity, is that you?

21:08.978 --> 21:10.310
Uh, hey, Mom.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.946
<i>That voice. It was Gloria.</i>

21:12.948 --> 21:15.115
Hey, did you, um...
did you move that box

21:15.117 --> 21:16.950
that had my demos in it?

21:16.952 --> 21:19.052
- Didn't touch it.
- So, I met a, um...

21:19.054 --> 21:23.957
this, like... a producer that
really wants to hear my music.

21:23.959 --> 21:27.161
Got to do homework!

21:27.163 --> 21:28.929
- Your new home.
- <i>Okay, CJ,</i>

21:28.931 --> 21:30.931
<i>you've got nothing to fear.</i>

21:30.933 --> 21:33.000
<i>I'm here to protect you.
Oh, cat!</i>

21:33.002 --> 21:35.202
Molly, no!

21:35.204 --> 21:38.906
Molly! Molly!

21:38.908 --> 21:41.909
No, no! No!

21:41.911 --> 21:44.278
- <i>Great. You love playing chase, too.</i>
- No!

21:44.280 --> 21:46.280
Stop!

21:46.282 --> 21:47.848
Not my homework!

21:47.850 --> 21:50.083
No, Molly!

21:50.085 --> 21:52.786
Molly, no. Molly!

21:52.788 --> 21:54.955
No!

21:54.957 --> 21:56.089
No, Molly, no!

21:56.091 --> 21:57.958
Slow down, Molly!

21:57.960 --> 21:59.860
Please. Molly.

21:59.862 --> 22:01.995
<i>There's so much
to chew on under here.</i>

22:01.997 --> 22:04.031
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

22:04.033 --> 22:05.999
<i>That was fun.</i>

22:06.001 --> 22:08.268
- <i>What's the next game?</i>
- Molly.

22:09.838 --> 22:12.172
You're Destructo-Dog.
Yes, you are.

22:12.174 --> 22:14.341
<i>Oh, I love my new bed.</i>

22:14.343 --> 22:18.245
- <i>Where do you sleep?</i>
- Here you go, Molly.

22:18.247 --> 22:20.781
Hilda said you were
mostly house-trained,

22:20.783 --> 22:22.382
so for now,
I'll just put a towel

22:22.384 --> 22:24.184
down here, just in case.

22:24.186 --> 22:26.554
<i>When you got to go,
you got to go.</i>

22:26.556 --> 22:28.922
No, Molly, no.

22:28.924 --> 22:30.891
CJ, I need to talk to you.

22:30.893 --> 22:32.159
Changing.

22:32.161 --> 22:34.228
Hello? Why's this door locked?

22:34.230 --> 22:35.796
CJ.

22:35.798 --> 22:37.364
Hey, come on.

22:37.366 --> 22:39.099
Just a minute.

22:39.101 --> 22:41.001
<i>Yeah, don't know this game.</i>

22:41.003 --> 22:42.302
<i>I will give it a try.</i>

22:42.304 --> 22:44.938
What's... what is with
all this noise?

22:44.940 --> 22:47.241
Uh, CJ, it looks like a bomb
went off in here.

22:47.243 --> 22:49.309
Um, I've been doing
a little rearranging.

22:49.311 --> 22:51.812
It smells terrible. Will you
at least open a window?

22:51.814 --> 22:53.213
I love your outfit.
Is it new?

22:53.215 --> 22:54.815
Do you love, love, love it?

22:54.817 --> 22:56.049
Mm, I have a date tonight.

22:56.051 --> 22:57.251
You're going out!

22:57.253 --> 22:58.986
Ow... How is he?

22:58.988 --> 23:00.287
Is he nice?

23:00.289 --> 23:03.123
Well, CJ, they always
start out nice.

23:03.125 --> 23:06.260
Um, so can you figure out
your-your dinner tonight?

23:06.262 --> 23:08.128
Again?

23:08.130 --> 23:09.965
Yeah.

23:15.304 --> 23:17.137
I think hiding you might be

23:17.139 --> 23:19.106
a little more difficult
than I thought.

23:30.919 --> 23:33.420
Hey, babe. You ready?

23:33.422 --> 23:35.224
- Whoo!
- Let's go.

23:46.902 --> 23:48.101
<i>Ow.</i>

23:48.103 --> 23:49.303
CJ?

23:49.305 --> 23:51.405
- Are you ready?
- What do I say?

23:51.407 --> 23:53.342
Ask a question
and keep calling back.

23:56.178 --> 23:59.114
Don't laugh.
I need to get into character.

24:03.352 --> 24:06.153
- <i>Uh, where did CJ go?</i>
- Wish me luck.

24:06.155 --> 24:07.655
<i>Oh, hi, CJ.</i>

24:13.095 --> 24:15.362
Hello?

24:15.364 --> 24:17.364
Hello? Is this Hilda?

24:17.366 --> 24:19.266
This is Gloria Mitchell.

24:19.268 --> 24:21.335
Hello.
I've been expecting your call.

24:21.337 --> 24:23.170
Wonderful, wonderful.

24:23.172 --> 24:27.374
My daughter, Clarity, brought
home that sweet dog today.

24:27.376 --> 24:30.377
We just adore her to pieces.

24:30.379 --> 24:32.379
Clarity, honey,
I'm telling Hilda

24:32.381 --> 24:34.981
how much we love Molly.

24:34.983 --> 24:38.686
Oh, uh, can you hold on for a sec?

24:38.688 --> 24:40.120
Right on time, Trent.

24:40.122 --> 24:42.122
Hello? This is Trent.

24:42.124 --> 24:44.458
How much kibble
should I feed Rocky?

24:44.460 --> 24:46.960
Half a cup.
Uh, I got to go.

24:48.297 --> 24:52.099
As I was saying, we'd love
to be her forever home.

24:52.101 --> 24:54.334
Oh, uh, can you hold on for a sec?

24:54.336 --> 24:55.335
Good work, Trent.

24:55.337 --> 24:58.138
Is that half a cup U.S.
or half a cup imperial?

24:58.140 --> 24:59.473
It's just half a cup.

24:59.475 --> 25:01.274
Maybe I should do it by weight.

25:01.276 --> 25:03.009
Y-You can do it
however you want.

25:03.011 --> 25:05.011
Uh, I got to go.

25:05.013 --> 25:07.047
- I'm sorry for all of these...
- And right now,

25:07.049 --> 25:09.182
I'm looking out
at our ginormously huge,

25:09.184 --> 25:12.319
grassy backyard,
and Molly and Clarity

25:12.321 --> 25:14.388
are rolling all around.

25:14.390 --> 25:16.423
Oh, dear.
Um, can you excuse me?

25:16.425 --> 25:18.058
I forgot to tell you,

25:18.060 --> 25:19.426
I gave Rocky a middle name.

25:19.428 --> 25:21.061
I'm really busy at the moment.

25:21.063 --> 25:22.295
Cliff. Get it?

25:22.297 --> 25:24.164
Rocky Cliff.
Pretty funny, right?

25:24.166 --> 25:26.166
Can I call you later
about this?

25:26.168 --> 25:28.034
Don't call me too late,
because I have school tomorrow

25:28.036 --> 25:29.302
and I need to go to bed early.

25:30.573 --> 25:32.973
Sounds like
a wonderful situation.

25:32.975 --> 25:34.742
I'm so glad it worked out.

25:34.744 --> 25:38.046
Well, then I'll leave you
alone, and thank you.

25:44.453 --> 25:46.219
- Well?
- We did it!

25:46.221 --> 25:47.387
That was amazing.

25:47.389 --> 25:48.989
I've never done
anything bad before.

25:48.991 --> 25:50.056
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

25:50.058 --> 25:53.193
<i>I can make noise, too!</i>

25:53.195 --> 25:54.562
Whoo! Let's go.
Come on, Rocky.

25:54.564 --> 25:56.062
High five.

25:56.064 --> 25:57.364
I love you, girl.

25:57.366 --> 25:59.199
Whoo! We did it!

26:21.490 --> 26:23.490
<i>I knew my purpose
was to protect CJ,</i>

26:23.492 --> 26:25.225
<i>but since she was safe,</i>

26:25.227 --> 26:28.094
<i>I thought it was okay
to play with Rocky.</i>

26:28.096 --> 26:30.397
Rocky destroyed
all the slippers in the house.

26:30.399 --> 26:32.633
My dad's doing a lot
of swearing in Mandarin.

26:32.635 --> 26:35.235
I had to take Molly out twice
last night.

26:35.237 --> 26:37.304
She still peed on my bed.

26:37.306 --> 26:39.507
I can't believe you managed
to hide a crazy puppy

26:39.509 --> 26:41.241
for even one day.

26:44.213 --> 26:45.981
We should train them together.

26:47.149 --> 26:49.082
You guys are going
to puppy school.

26:52.087 --> 26:53.453
- Rocky, come on! No!
- No, Molly, no!

26:53.455 --> 26:56.122
<i>Oh, why are they
walking so slow?</i>

26:56.124 --> 26:57.157
Rocky, slow down!

26:57.159 --> 26:59.159
Sit. Sit.

26:59.161 --> 27:01.294
Sit.

27:01.296 --> 27:04.130
Okay, then stand.

27:04.132 --> 27:05.633
Good dog.

27:05.635 --> 27:07.267
No, you have to be
the authority.

27:07.269 --> 27:08.268
Watch and learn.

27:08.270 --> 27:10.838
Lie down. Lie down.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.405
- Lie down.
- <i>I'll wait till you come up</i>

27:12.407 --> 27:14.407
<i>with a better game.</i>

27:14.409 --> 27:16.443
You see? Good girl.

27:19.549 --> 27:21.516
Stay. Wait.

27:21.518 --> 27:24.150
Wait. No, Rocky. Stop! Rocky!

27:24.152 --> 27:25.620
Paw. Paw. Come on, girl.

27:25.622 --> 27:27.287
Let's go, girl.

27:27.289 --> 27:29.155
- <i>Mm, what is a paw?</i>
- Paw. Come on.

27:29.157 --> 27:30.525
Paw. Come on.

27:30.527 --> 27:32.492
- Let's go.
- <i>Maybe this is a paw?</i>

27:32.494 --> 27:34.529
Good girl. Good, good girl!

27:34.531 --> 27:37.297
<i>I can do paw!
I-I-I can do paw!</i>

27:37.299 --> 27:41.368
It's a deal. You have graduated
puppy school right now.

27:41.370 --> 27:42.670
- Rocky, come back!
- Good, good girl.

27:42.672 --> 27:44.607
- Rocky! Rocky!
- Good girl. Mwah.

27:56.318 --> 27:58.686
You can stay here
while I'm at school.

27:58.688 --> 28:02.188
No barking, okay?

28:02.190 --> 28:06.594
<i>Don't really
understand what's happening.</i>

28:09.164 --> 28:11.666
<i>Can't wait to show this to CJ.</i>

28:11.668 --> 28:14.200
<i>Uh, is that
supposed to be food?</i>

28:14.202 --> 28:16.336
Maybe if I wasn't
going commando...

28:19.576 --> 28:21.609
<i>Where'd that great smell
come from?</i>

28:21.611 --> 28:23.209
<i>I love it.</i>

28:25.314 --> 28:26.479
<i>CJ?</i>

28:27.917 --> 28:29.517
Clarity, did you hear that?

28:29.519 --> 28:33.353
I think it came
from the basement. I'll check.

28:33.355 --> 28:34.622
<i>I, uh... I'm here, CJ!</i>

28:34.624 --> 28:36.557
<i>You-you remembered!</i>

28:36.559 --> 28:38.191
Shh.

28:38.193 --> 28:40.528
Molly, shh.

28:40.530 --> 28:42.395
Shh.

28:42.397 --> 28:45.566
<i>Again with the "shh."
What does "shh" mean?</i>

28:45.568 --> 28:49.235
Nothing here, Mom.
I think it was next door.

28:52.174 --> 28:53.507
<i>Belly rub, please.</i>

28:53.509 --> 28:56.644
Gonna have to tell her
about you, Molly.

28:56.646 --> 29:00.246
Mom, there's something
I want to tell you.

29:00.248 --> 29:03.684
Hey, so if you, uh,
order a pizza for dinner,

29:03.686 --> 29:06.286
do not eat the whole thing,
okay?

29:06.288 --> 29:08.355
Life is harder
when you're chubby.

29:08.357 --> 29:10.423
Plus, you claim you want
to be a singer.

29:10.425 --> 29:12.526
Got to look good.

29:12.528 --> 29:14.394
<i>It felt like CJ got hit,</i>

29:14.396 --> 29:16.296
<i>but I didn't see what hit her.</i>

29:16.298 --> 29:17.965
Mm, what'd you want to tell me?

29:17.967 --> 29:21.267
Just wanted to know
what time you'll be home.

29:21.269 --> 29:23.205
Not too late.

29:28.745 --> 29:31.277
Mommy!

29:31.279 --> 29:32.780
Mommy, I'm scared!

29:32.782 --> 29:34.582
<i>Wait for me, CJ!</i>

29:34.584 --> 29:37.283
<i>CJ was afraid.</i>

29:37.285 --> 29:39.285
<i>Uh, I was afraid.</i>

29:39.287 --> 29:43.356
<i>Maybe if I protect her,
she'll protect me.</i>

29:47.429 --> 29:50.731
I used to hate it
when my mom stayed out late.

29:52.602 --> 29:55.002
And now I have you.

29:55.004 --> 29:57.838
I don't have to be scared
anymore.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.775
I know you'll protect me.

30:00.777 --> 30:03.010
<i>Make that noise stop.</i>

30:03.012 --> 30:05.180
<i>I'm really, really scared.</i>

30:16.726 --> 30:19.259
Knock, knock.

30:19.261 --> 30:21.261
Hey, morning, sweetie.

30:21.263 --> 30:22.630
Good morning.

30:22.632 --> 30:24.431
Um, so I thought
it might be nice

30:24.433 --> 30:25.700
if I cooked you some breakfast.

30:25.702 --> 30:28.368
What? Do you even know
how to do that?

30:28.370 --> 30:30.470
You silly. Of course I do.

30:30.472 --> 30:32.472
<i>I need to get outside.
I need to go.</i>

30:32.474 --> 30:34.340
Wh-What... what is that?

30:34.342 --> 30:36.711
This is, um... this is...

30:36.713 --> 30:37.845
Hi.

30:37.847 --> 30:39.448
You must be Clarity.
I'm Paul.

30:40.616 --> 30:41.882
And who's that little fella?

30:41.884 --> 30:43.684
Little gal.

30:43.686 --> 30:45.586
- Her name's Molly.
- <i>Are we getting up?</i>

30:45.588 --> 30:47.521
<i>I seriously need to go.</i>

30:47.523 --> 30:49.289
Oh, what a sweetie.

30:49.291 --> 30:51.458
- I love dogs.
- Oh, yeah?

30:51.460 --> 30:52.626
Me and my mom do, too.

30:52.628 --> 30:54.762
I have to take Molly out
for a walk,

30:54.764 --> 30:56.496
but we'll be back
for breakfast.

30:56.498 --> 30:57.765
Okay.

30:57.767 --> 30:59.800
Um, I'll go start
those mimosas.

30:59.802 --> 31:01.637
Great.

31:10.513 --> 31:13.649
We're in trouble, Molly.
Yes, we are.

31:27.597 --> 31:30.097
You went behind my back
and you got a dog?

31:30.099 --> 31:31.632
You're not allowed
to have a dog.

31:31.634 --> 31:32.800
You understand me?

31:32.802 --> 31:34.400
<i>Gloria sounded angry.</i>

31:34.402 --> 31:35.703
<i>Smelled pretty strong, too.</i>

31:35.705 --> 31:37.905
Hey, babe,
you want another mimosa?

31:37.907 --> 31:40.406
Oh, yeah, that'd be lovely.

31:40.408 --> 31:42.408
I'm keeping her.

31:42.410 --> 31:45.378
<i>Maybe if she plays,
she will feel happy.</i>

31:45.380 --> 31:46.446
I'm keeping Molly.

31:46.448 --> 31:48.649
I am your mother,
and I am the boss.

31:48.651 --> 31:50.551
And you're not supposed
to leave your 11-year-old

31:50.553 --> 31:52.920
alone at night,
almost every night,

31:52.922 --> 31:54.922
during terrifying
thunderstorms.

31:54.924 --> 31:57.658
I'm sure my teacher
would be very interested

31:57.660 --> 31:59.827
in a mother who did that.

31:59.829 --> 32:01.394
Are you threatening me?

32:01.396 --> 32:03.764
I get scared.

32:04.934 --> 32:07.467
Molly protects me.

32:07.469 --> 32:09.435
You can't make me
get rid of her.

32:09.437 --> 32:10.704
See?

32:10.706 --> 32:12.773
She's my best friend.

32:12.775 --> 32:14.842
And I'll do everything for her.

32:14.844 --> 32:17.445
You didn't even know
she was here.

32:23.820 --> 32:25.820
That dog needs a bath.

32:25.822 --> 32:27.521
You're staying with me.

32:27.523 --> 32:28.823
You get to stay with me.

32:28.825 --> 32:30.991
<i>Good girl, CJ.
You're a good girl.</i>

32:30.993 --> 32:33.459
Yep, you do need a bath.

32:33.461 --> 32:34.895
Yep. You do.

32:34.897 --> 32:36.864
Look, Molly, my charm bracelet.

32:36.866 --> 32:39.533
It has my two favorite things
in the whole world:

32:39.535 --> 32:40.768
you and my guitar.

32:40.770 --> 32:43.170
<i>Thank you for
showing me whatever that is.</i>

32:43.172 --> 32:45.172
<i>Uh, I will be going back
to sleep now.</i>

33:21.443 --> 33:24.511
♪ I'll be here ♪

33:24.513 --> 33:26.749
♪ With you ♪

33:29.685 --> 33:33.520
♪ Near or far ♪

33:33.522 --> 33:36.924
♪ The end or the start... ♪

33:36.926 --> 33:38.792
Hey.

33:38.794 --> 33:42.529
Good old Trent, always on time.

33:42.531 --> 33:45.032
<i>Good old Rocky,
always on time.</i>

33:45.034 --> 33:46.800
Hey.

33:46.802 --> 33:48.669
Hey.

33:48.671 --> 33:50.504
<i>First,
I'm gonna pull the stick,</i>

33:50.506 --> 33:52.940
<i>then you pull the stick,
then I'll pull the stick.</i>

33:52.942 --> 33:54.642
Look at our babies.

33:54.644 --> 33:56.810
Yep. All grown-up.

33:56.812 --> 33:58.812
Hey, should we start
saving for college?

33:58.814 --> 34:02.850
Molly and I aren't exactly
on the college track, Trent.

34:02.852 --> 34:05.653
I'm actually thinking about
dropping out of school.

34:05.655 --> 34:07.955
If I told my parents I was
dropping out of high school,

34:07.957 --> 34:09.790
they would
spontaneously combust.

34:11.960 --> 34:16.096
Yeah, well, as soon as I can,
I'm getting out of here.

34:16.098 --> 34:18.032
I'm gonna move
to New York City.

34:18.034 --> 34:19.766
And how are you gonna do that?

34:19.768 --> 34:24.538
There was this insurance
settlement when my dad died.

34:24.540 --> 34:27.107
I finally get the money
when I'm 18, so...

34:27.109 --> 34:29.275
I'm gonna use it to move
to New York,

34:29.277 --> 34:32.980
make a demo and get my career
started as a musician.

34:32.982 --> 34:35.952
You hardly ever talk
about your dad.

34:38.987 --> 34:40.821
<i>I-I can tell when CJ needs me.</i>

34:40.822 --> 34:42.623
<i>Uh, hold on, Rocky.
I'll be right back.</i>

34:42.625 --> 34:44.792
Hey, Molly.

34:44.793 --> 34:47.795
Want to sit? Come on.

34:47.797 --> 34:48.996
Hey.

34:48.998 --> 34:51.098
Yeah, well...

34:51.100 --> 34:53.801
died right before
I was born, so...

34:53.803 --> 34:55.735
I don't really know
anything about him.

34:55.737 --> 34:59.106
Well, except Gloria said
his parents tried to steal

34:59.108 --> 35:01.942
that money from me
when I was a baby.

35:01.944 --> 35:03.944
So... I don't know.

35:03.946 --> 35:06.780
Maybe she's drunk
half the time, but...

35:06.782 --> 35:09.116
she did do
one good thing for me.

35:09.118 --> 35:11.618
<i>Sometimes
CJ squeezed me so tight,</i>

35:11.620 --> 35:13.020
<i>I could barely breathe.</i>

35:13.022 --> 35:15.589
<i>I loved it.</i>

35:23.032 --> 35:25.899
Hey. Uh, are you gonna
buy something?

35:25.901 --> 35:28.035
'Cause if you are,
I got to go back in.

35:28.037 --> 35:29.737
Oh. Guess I was.

35:29.739 --> 35:31.907
I'm not, like, in a hurry
or anything, though.

35:34.043 --> 35:36.076
Let me guess.

35:36.078 --> 35:38.045
A bag of pretzels and a Sprite.

35:39.982 --> 35:42.783
Okay, I guess I'm
pretty predictable.

35:42.785 --> 35:44.918
Shane.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.354
CJ.

35:47.356 --> 35:49.957
Um, that's Molly.

35:49.959 --> 35:52.092
<i>I'm getting a bad
feeling about this person.</i>

35:52.094 --> 35:53.627
What's it doing?

35:53.629 --> 35:54.928
Getting ready to pee on me?

35:54.930 --> 35:56.797
Cool it, Molly.

35:58.968 --> 36:00.936
Sorry.

36:02.938 --> 36:04.671
- So, you like motorcycles?
- Kind of.

36:04.673 --> 36:05.739
- Yeah?
- Cool it, Molly.

36:05.741 --> 36:08.142
<i>You're supposed
to throw the ball.</i>

36:09.812 --> 36:11.078
<i>You pick it up and throw it.</i>

36:11.080 --> 36:13.747
<i>And then I get it
and you throw it again.</i>

36:13.749 --> 36:14.982
No, thanks, doggy.

36:14.984 --> 36:16.183
<i>He doesn't understand.</i>

36:16.185 --> 36:18.020
<i>Mm, he's not too smart.</i>

36:20.656 --> 36:21.822
You want this, Molly?

36:21.824 --> 36:23.157
You want to go get it?

36:23.159 --> 36:24.093
Go get it.

36:26.796 --> 36:28.929
<i>Rocky! Trent!</i>

36:30.666 --> 36:32.199
<i>Ooh, a quick sniff
of Rocky's butt</i>

36:32.201 --> 36:35.936
<i>told me everything
was going great for Rocky.</i>

36:35.938 --> 36:37.706
Come on, let's go.

36:39.775 --> 36:40.974
Hey, Trent.

36:40.976 --> 36:42.843
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

36:42.845 --> 36:44.845
This is Shane.

36:44.847 --> 36:46.146
Oh, hey.

36:46.148 --> 36:48.082
Hey.

36:48.084 --> 36:50.851
<i>Hmm. Both of them
want to be in CJ's pack.</i>

36:50.853 --> 36:52.953
Hey, what's up?
Uh, you didn't return my call.

36:52.955 --> 36:55.956
Oh, right. Sorry.
I've... been kind of busy.

36:55.958 --> 36:59.059
Who is this, your mother?

36:59.061 --> 37:00.127
<i>They weren't
growling at each other</i>

37:00.129 --> 37:02.262
<i>on the outside,
but they were still growling.</i>

37:02.264 --> 37:03.997
Check it out.

37:03.999 --> 37:06.100
Talent show, next week.

37:06.102 --> 37:07.968
This is a chance for you

37:07.970 --> 37:10.137
to actually perform
in front of an audience.

37:10.139 --> 37:12.139
Wow.

37:12.141 --> 37:13.841
I bet you'd be great.

37:13.843 --> 37:15.742
Oh, come on. You haven't
heard me sing in years.

37:15.744 --> 37:18.278
I know, but you have to perform
in front of people someday.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.280
Plus, the winner gets $500.

37:20.282 --> 37:23.016
Yeah, do it, CJ.
I mean, you can sing a song

37:23.018 --> 37:25.018
between the magician
and the mime.

37:27.923 --> 37:29.756
Does look kind of lame, Trent.

37:31.093 --> 37:32.459
Thanks, though.

37:32.461 --> 37:35.229
Let's hit it.

37:35.231 --> 37:37.965
Maybe I'll see you later?

40:00.976 --> 40:03.176
- <i>Trent!</i>
- Hey, girl.

40:03.178 --> 40:06.313
<i>I need to find CJ.</i>

40:06.315 --> 40:08.415
<i>I don't smell her.</i>

40:08.417 --> 40:11.051
<i>Uh, keep going.
I'll bark if I smell her.</i>

40:13.055 --> 40:14.622
<i>Uh, th-there she is!</i>

40:14.624 --> 40:16.056
<i>S-Stop! I said stop!</i>

40:19.629 --> 40:21.194
Molly.

40:21.196 --> 40:22.963
<i>CJ, I'm back!</i>

40:22.965 --> 40:24.632
- <i>I found you.</i>
- Hey.

40:26.935 --> 40:28.869
Hey.

40:28.871 --> 40:30.638
Thank you.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.074
Thank you.

40:34.376 --> 40:36.977
<i>Trent got that
other guy out of the pack.</i>

40:36.979 --> 40:38.412
<i>I'm guessing
he finally bit him.</i>

40:38.414 --> 40:40.213
I was such an idiot.

40:40.215 --> 40:42.015
Hey, it happens.

40:43.185 --> 40:45.185
You never make bad choices.

40:45.187 --> 40:48.055
I'm too afraid of my parents.

40:48.057 --> 40:49.356
At least you don't have to do

40:49.358 --> 40:51.291
a hundred hours
of community service.

40:51.293 --> 40:53.226
Wait, so you're gonna be
one of those people

40:53.228 --> 40:55.195
picking up trash
on the side of the highway?

40:55.197 --> 40:58.499
No, actually,
I got assigned to this program

40:58.501 --> 41:01.335
that trains dogs
to sniff cancer.

41:01.337 --> 41:03.070
- Cancer?
- Yeah.

41:03.072 --> 41:05.072
Sounds pretty wacky, but...

41:05.074 --> 41:08.010
at least I get
to take Molly with me.

41:12.448 --> 41:14.981
So, we're a pilot program,
which is very exciting

41:14.983 --> 41:17.250
because we've been getting
amazing results.

41:17.252 --> 41:19.052
Wait, so you're telling me

41:19.054 --> 41:22.022
these dogs know people
have cancer before doctors do?

41:22.024 --> 41:24.491
We see the world.
Dogs smell it.

41:24.493 --> 41:27.994
Their sense of smell is
100,000 times as acute as ours.

41:27.996 --> 41:30.997
So, we're working on trying
to get the dogs to recognize

41:30.999 --> 41:34.301
the difference between cancer
samples and benign samples.

41:34.303 --> 41:36.136
If we successfully
scent-train a dog,

41:36.138 --> 41:38.506
it can make the difference
between life and death.

41:38.508 --> 41:41.174
Wait, so I get
to scent-train a dog?

41:41.176 --> 41:42.476
That's so cool.

41:42.478 --> 41:44.980
I love the enthusiasm,
but first...

41:49.284 --> 41:51.418
<i>I hope this isn't CJ's purpose.</i>

42:00.129 --> 42:01.962
<i>We went every day.</i>

42:01.964 --> 42:04.131
<i>CJ was happy,
and that made me happy.</i>

42:11.541 --> 42:13.306
<i>Why is he getting treats?</i>

42:13.308 --> 42:15.344
<i>I want treats, too.</i>

42:20.249 --> 42:22.583
- Good dog, Bode.
- <i>Okay.</i>

42:22.585 --> 42:25.185
<i>If Bode gets one more treat
and I get nothing,</i>

42:25.187 --> 42:28.056
<i>I'm gonna go nuts.</i>

42:29.258 --> 42:32.194
Good boy. Good boy, Bode.

42:38.333 --> 42:40.066
<i>Mm, that smell.</i>

42:40.068 --> 42:42.335
<i>Is that why Bode gets treats?</i>

42:42.337 --> 42:44.440
<i>Maybe if I...</i>

42:48.110 --> 42:50.345
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

42:52.114 --> 42:53.447
Good girl.

42:53.449 --> 42:54.414
<i>That's it.</i>

42:54.416 --> 42:57.585
<i>If you smell the smell,
you get a treat.</i>

42:57.587 --> 43:01.087
CJ, do you mind if I start
training Molly, too?

43:02.592 --> 43:05.961
Good girl, Molly.

<i>I know that smell.</i>

43:26.583 --> 43:28.415
Hi, Gloria.

43:28.417 --> 43:30.183
It's good to see you.

43:30.185 --> 43:32.252
<i>Ethan and Hannah! Finally!</i>

43:32.254 --> 43:33.821
Why, hello.

43:33.823 --> 43:36.122
Who is this? Hello.

43:36.124 --> 43:37.825
- <i>Ethan! It's me, Bailey!</i>
- Hey. Who are you?

43:37.827 --> 43:39.259
<i>I'm a girl now.</i>

43:39.261 --> 43:40.329
- This is a surprise.
- Gloria.

43:43.198 --> 43:46.333
We sent a note saying
we're going to be in the area

43:46.335 --> 43:48.569
and we hoped it'd be okay
to stop by.

43:48.571 --> 43:49.670
Did you? Okay.

43:49.672 --> 43:51.404
Must have missed that.

43:51.406 --> 43:52.472
<i>Look, Ethan, look!</i>

43:52.474 --> 43:55.075
We were cleaning out the barn,
and we found a...

43:55.077 --> 43:56.409
a-a lot of Henry's things.

43:56.411 --> 43:57.845
- We thought that...
- Yes.

43:57.847 --> 44:00.480
We thought that you and CJ
might like to see it.

44:00.482 --> 44:02.617
<i>Is anyone seeing
what I'm doing here?</i>

44:02.619 --> 44:04.451
Yeah, you could have sent
whatever that is.

44:04.453 --> 44:06.186
Well, we wanted to see you.

44:06.188 --> 44:08.288
We want to see CJ.

44:08.290 --> 44:10.190
Well, we don't want
to see you, which is why...

44:10.192 --> 44:12.125
<i>Ethan, it's me, Bailey!</i>

44:12.127 --> 44:13.426
<i>Can't you tell it's me?</i>

44:13.428 --> 44:15.295
Is that you, Boss Dog?

44:15.297 --> 44:17.598
<i>It's me, it's me, it's me!</i>

44:17.600 --> 44:19.301
Quiet!

44:20.670 --> 44:23.336
Gloria, we just want to see CJ.

44:23.338 --> 44:26.139
What makes you think
you can just show up like this?

44:26.141 --> 44:28.308
Okay, I-I-I'm not
a little kid anymore,

44:28.310 --> 44:30.578
so you can't...
you can't push me around.

44:30.580 --> 44:32.112
We want to see
our granddaughter,

44:32.114 --> 44:33.446
just to see how she's doing.

44:33.448 --> 44:34.615
<i>Ooh, I'll go
tell CJ you're here.</i>

44:34.617 --> 44:36.884
Well, she doesn't want
to see you.

44:36.886 --> 44:39.219
- Is she home?
- That is none of your business!

44:39.221 --> 44:40.655
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>

44:40.657 --> 44:42.557
<i>Ethan and Hannah are here,</i>

44:42.559 --> 44:44.124
<i>and they smell
better than ever.</i>

44:44.126 --> 44:45.425
- <i>Come! Come now!</i>
- Hey. What you doing?

44:45.427 --> 44:47.227
<i>Let's go. Follow me.</i>

44:47.229 --> 44:50.363
We have a whole life without you.

44:50.365 --> 44:52.500
- I really don't appreciate this ambush.
- "Ambush"?

44:52.502 --> 44:55.201
Oh, oh, Gloria, we're family.

44:55.203 --> 44:56.571
Gloria.

44:56.573 --> 44:58.271
Can't we just start again?
Please.

44:58.273 --> 44:59.607
- Let's just start over.
- Glo...

44:59.609 --> 45:02.077
Gloria, Gloria, please.

45:06.716 --> 45:08.348
<i>Y-You forgot
Ethan and Hannah.</i>

45:08.350 --> 45:10.183
Don't look at me like that.

45:10.185 --> 45:12.385
All these years later, they
still want to take her from me.

45:15.257 --> 45:16.624
<i>Gloria!</i>

45:16.626 --> 45:19.560
<i>L-Let them in.
It's Ethan and Hannah.</i>

45:19.562 --> 45:21.762
I'll just leave it here.

45:27.235 --> 45:29.770
I know that's you, Boss Dog.

45:29.772 --> 45:32.238
<i>I love it when he
calls me "Boss Dog."</i>

45:32.240 --> 45:33.641
You just keep looking after CJ.

45:33.643 --> 45:35.511
Okay.

45:41.450 --> 45:42.950
<i>No, don't leave!</i>

45:42.952 --> 45:45.120
<i>CJ's here.</i>

45:47.657 --> 45:49.525
Come on, Molly. Come on.

45:50.693 --> 45:53.694
Okay.

45:53.696 --> 45:56.296
Good job, Molly.

45:56.298 --> 45:58.532
Andi says you've really taken
to scent training.

45:58.534 --> 45:59.533
<i>Food, please.</i>

45:59.535 --> 46:01.267
Yo.

46:01.269 --> 46:02.503
<i>Leave us alone.</i>

46:02.505 --> 46:04.672
What are you doing here?

46:04.674 --> 46:06.272
You don't answer my calls.

46:06.274 --> 46:07.608
Yeah, because I don't want
to talk to you, Shane.

46:07.610 --> 46:10.243
Come on, CJ. You're not still
mad about the party?

46:10.245 --> 46:12.345
Don't walk away from me.

46:12.347 --> 46:13.446
Whoa, get off. Shane!

46:13.448 --> 46:14.447
What are you doing?

46:14.449 --> 46:16.383
- I thought you were cooler than this.
- Shane!

46:16.385 --> 46:18.786
Aah! It bit me!

46:18.788 --> 46:21.221
<i>Go away. CJ doesn't like you.</i>

46:21.223 --> 46:23.423
I'm gonna kill that stupid dog!

46:24.594 --> 46:26.729
<i>I don't like you, either.</i>

46:30.399 --> 46:31.699
Richard, if that's you,

46:31.701 --> 46:34.300
why don't you come get
your junk?

46:34.302 --> 46:36.003
Oh, it's you.

46:36.005 --> 46:38.340
Richard left.

46:39.709 --> 46:42.375
Shane just attacked me.

46:48.584 --> 46:52.720
<i>Gloria smelled
stronger than usual.</i>

46:52.722 --> 46:54.722
Well...

46:54.724 --> 46:57.625
looks like today's not
a good day for us and men.

47:00.596 --> 47:02.395
Right.

47:02.397 --> 47:04.332
You're drunk.

47:07.570 --> 47:09.469
Yeah.

47:09.471 --> 47:11.706
Adults are allowed to get drunk

47:11.708 --> 47:14.508
when they get dumped
by their boyfriend

47:14.510 --> 47:17.511
who borrowed money
they will never see again.

47:17.513 --> 47:19.680
I just told you that some guy
attacked me, Mom.

47:19.682 --> 47:22.516
It was really scary.
Do you even care?

47:22.518 --> 47:25.519
Well, what did you do?
Did you... did you lead him on?

47:25.521 --> 47:28.356
Did you provoke him
or something?

47:32.360 --> 47:34.530
I cannot believe
you just said that.

47:36.498 --> 47:38.699
You are literally
the worst mother in the world.

47:38.701 --> 47:40.603
No, that was my mother.

47:46.441 --> 47:47.742
I'm leaving.

47:47.744 --> 47:49.643
I don't want to be here
anymore.

47:49.645 --> 47:52.713
I'm taking my money,
and I'm moving out.

47:52.715 --> 47:54.648
- Ooh, what money?
- The money from Dad's settlement.

47:54.650 --> 47:56.652
Oh, Clarity, that money's gone.

47:58.855 --> 48:00.621
What?

48:00.623 --> 48:04.792
How do you think
we have a house?

48:04.794 --> 48:07.429
And a car?

48:09.632 --> 48:12.432
But... but that money
was for me.

48:12.434 --> 48:13.801
Well, it's been for you, CJ!

48:13.803 --> 48:15.603
I am alone.

48:15.605 --> 48:18.404
How do you expect me to do...
to do this on my own?

48:18.406 --> 48:20.674
W-Wait.

48:20.676 --> 48:22.943
So, all of the...

48:22.945 --> 48:25.546
all of the travel, Mom,

48:25.548 --> 48:28.916
the-the closet
full of designer clothes,

48:28.918 --> 48:32.887
the cases of wine...

48:32.889 --> 48:36.324
that... that's all been
my inheritance?

48:37.693 --> 48:40.563
I deserve nice things, too.

48:42.532 --> 48:45.733
Mom, that money
was the only thing

48:45.735 --> 48:47.703
I ever got from my dad.

48:51.808 --> 48:55.943
That was the only thing
that made me feel like,

48:55.945 --> 48:58.746
somewhere in the world,
there might actually be

48:58.748 --> 49:00.616
someone looking out for me.

49:02.384 --> 49:04.518
But I guess that was
really stupid, wasn't it?

49:04.520 --> 49:06.153
You cannot take the car.

49:06.155 --> 49:08.423
Why not? I paid for it.

49:23.706 --> 49:25.172
<i>I never knew there could be</i>

49:25.174 --> 49:27.342
<i>such a thing as a sad car ride.</i>

49:32.882 --> 49:34.482
What?

49:35.751 --> 49:36.786
Shane?

49:38.855 --> 49:40.890
Ugh, leave me alone.

49:57.840 --> 49:58.774
What are you doing?

50:02.712 --> 50:04.645
<i>All I wanted to do was stay</i>

50:04.647 --> 50:06.580
<i>on my seat, but the car
kept pushing me off.</i>

50:06.582 --> 50:07.516
Sorry, Molly.

50:11.821 --> 50:13.623
Oh, God.

50:16.893 --> 50:18.491
What?

50:21.864 --> 50:23.463
<i>The car's gone crazy.</i>

50:57.867 --> 50:59.533
Molly?

50:59.535 --> 51:02.703
<i>The car finally stopped.</i>

51:02.705 --> 51:04.738
<i>Are you okay, CJ?</i>

51:04.740 --> 51:07.977
Molly? Molly?

51:12.581 --> 51:14.815
<i>Oh, I love that sound.</i>

51:14.817 --> 51:16.784
<i>It means CJ's nearby.</i>

51:16.786 --> 51:19.922
Molly. Molly?

51:21.824 --> 51:22.990
Molly?

51:22.992 --> 51:25.559
<i>But now I know I'm leaving her.</i>

51:25.561 --> 51:27.628
- <i>I don't want to.</i>
- Molly.

51:27.630 --> 51:28.963
<i>But I have no choice.</i>

51:28.965 --> 51:30.700
Molly.

51:32.001 --> 51:33.968
Molly.

51:33.970 --> 51:37.538
- No, Molly.
- <i>I remembered baby CJ on the farm</i>

51:37.540 --> 51:40.607
<i>and how much I wanted
to protect her.</i>

51:40.609 --> 51:43.844
<i>How much she needed me.</i>

51:43.846 --> 51:45.846
<i>Her journey...</i>

51:45.848 --> 51:47.848
<i>is not over.</i>

51:57.760 --> 52:00.096
Come on.

52:02.064 --> 52:04.765
<i>CJ was so sad.</i>

52:04.767 --> 52:06.502
<i>She still needs me.</i>

52:08.637 --> 52:12.039
<i>CJ, wherever you are,
I promise...</i>

52:12.041 --> 52:14.043
<i>I'll find you.</i>

52:19.749 --> 52:22.783
<i>But first, I need to get
a few things out of the way.</i>

52:22.785 --> 52:24.918
<i>I need to play.
I need to wrestle.</i>

52:24.920 --> 52:26.787
<i>I need to bite a few faces.</i>

52:26.789 --> 52:27.788
<i>I need to bark.</i>

52:27.790 --> 52:28.989
<i>I need to play with a blanket.</i>

52:28.991 --> 52:31.527
<i>I need to bite some ears.</i>

52:33.796 --> 52:36.797
<i>And, unfortunately,
I still have to take baths.</i>

52:45.041 --> 52:48.108
<i>I knew my journey
was with CJ, but...</i>

52:48.110 --> 52:50.077
<i>I couldn't find her scent
anywhere.</i>

52:50.079 --> 52:51.879
Come on, Big Dog.

52:51.881 --> 52:53.714
- Yeah.
- <i>Now I lived with Joe.</i>

52:53.716 --> 52:56.183
- Ready for another day?
- <i>He was good to me.</i>

52:56.185 --> 52:59.086
<i>He lived in a house
made out of snacks.</i>

52:59.088 --> 53:01.622
Just for you.

53:01.624 --> 53:04.925
Okay, bon appétit.

53:06.729 --> 53:09.165
<i>Ah, these are my favorite.</i>

53:13.135 --> 53:15.169
- Enjoy it.
- <i>I forgot about these.</i>

53:15.171 --> 53:17.106
<i>No, these are definitely
my favorite.</i>

53:18.674 --> 53:20.707
Oh, no ice cream for you.

53:20.709 --> 53:22.176
How about a Slim Jim? Huh?

53:22.178 --> 53:23.644
- <i>That's the one.</i>
- Yeah.

53:23.646 --> 53:24.711
<i>We have a winner.</i>

53:24.713 --> 53:25.846
<i>My favorite.</i>

53:35.024 --> 53:36.990
<i>Then, one day,</i>

53:36.992 --> 53:39.793
<i>I heard something
that reminded me of...</i>

53:39.795 --> 53:41.730
<i>Huh?</i>

53:45.101 --> 53:47.103
<i>That sound.</i>

53:48.804 --> 53:50.070
Morning.

53:50.072 --> 53:52.973
Hi.

53:54.143 --> 53:55.744
<i>Huh?</i>

53:59.115 --> 54:01.016
<i>Could it be?</i>

54:03.018 --> 54:06.987
<i>Maybe one more sniff,
just to be sure.</i>

54:06.989 --> 54:08.155
How's your day going?

54:08.157 --> 54:09.690
Um, pretty good, thanks.

54:09.692 --> 54:10.791
That'll be $4.50.

54:10.793 --> 54:11.959
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

54:11.961 --> 54:14.161
<i>It's my CJ. I found you!</i>

54:14.163 --> 54:16.163
Big Dog.

54:16.165 --> 54:18.198
He never gets up for anything.

54:18.200 --> 54:20.968
"Big Dog"? How'd you ever
come up with that name?

54:20.970 --> 54:23.036
Just sort of came to me.

54:23.038 --> 54:25.105
Hey there, Big Dog. Hey.

54:25.107 --> 54:27.107
- <i>Now I can go with you.</i>
- How you doing?

54:27.109 --> 54:28.475
<i>Where are we going?</i>

54:28.477 --> 54:29.877
Must smell a dog on you.

54:29.879 --> 54:31.745
Oh, I don't have a dog.

54:31.747 --> 54:33.147
Used to, though.

54:33.149 --> 54:36.049
Her name was Molly.
She was the best.

54:36.051 --> 54:38.654
<i>Oh, she knows it's me.
We're finally back together.</i>

54:40.823 --> 54:42.856
- Oh.
- Oh, paw.

54:42.858 --> 54:44.791
That is so sweet.

54:44.793 --> 54:47.494
I, um...
I trained my dog to shake.

54:47.496 --> 54:49.930
He's never done that before.

54:49.932 --> 54:52.166
Really? Huh.

54:52.168 --> 54:55.936
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Big Dog.

54:55.938 --> 54:58.805
Um, oh, can I also get
a lottery scratch card?

54:58.807 --> 54:59.940
Mm-hmm.

54:59.942 --> 55:01.208
So, where you headed?

55:01.210 --> 55:02.809
Uh, New York City.

55:02.811 --> 55:04.044
<i>I hope Joe tells her about</i>

55:04.046 --> 55:05.179
<i>how much I love meat sticks.</i>

55:05.181 --> 55:07.214
Oh, you got a job or something?

55:07.216 --> 55:09.082
Well, I'm a singer-songwriter.

55:09.084 --> 55:12.219
Trying to be
a singer-songwriter, so...

55:12.221 --> 55:14.821
- Oh, no way. 50 bucks.
- Ah.

55:14.823 --> 55:17.090
- Congratulations.
- Wow.

55:17.092 --> 55:19.159
Never won anything before
in my life.

55:19.161 --> 55:21.028
You must be a lucky dog.

55:21.030 --> 55:22.829
<i>And I hope Joe tells her about</i>

55:22.831 --> 55:24.532
<i>the crunchy, salty things, too.
Oh, they're so good.</i>

55:24.534 --> 55:26.099
Thank you.

55:26.101 --> 55:28.268
Okay. See ya.

55:28.270 --> 55:30.971
- Travel safe.
- <i>I wished I could thank Joe for taking</i>

55:30.973 --> 55:32.206
<i>such good care of me
all this time.</i>

55:32.208 --> 55:33.840
<i>I hoped he knew
how grateful I was.</i>

55:33.842 --> 55:36.243
Oh, no, no.
You have to stay here, Big Dog.

55:36.245 --> 55:38.981
<i>CJ, no. I'm supposed to come with you.</i>

55:52.995 --> 55:55.030
<i>CJ, wait. What are you doing?</i>

55:57.967 --> 55:59.066
<i>No! No, you can't leave me.</i>

55:59.068 --> 56:01.201
<i>I told Ethan I would protect you.</i>

56:01.203 --> 56:02.369
Big Dog.

56:02.371 --> 56:03.937
<i>CJ, come back.</i>

56:03.939 --> 56:05.872
<i>I need to help you.</i>

56:05.874 --> 56:07.407
Big Dog!

56:07.409 --> 56:09.876
<i>Please, take me with you.</i>

56:11.947 --> 56:13.581
<i>No! No!
I can't lose you.</i>

56:13.583 --> 56:16.852
<i>I will never stop.
I will never stop.</i>

56:18.588 --> 56:21.021
<i>Slow... slow down.</i>

56:21.023 --> 56:24.157
<i>I'm sorry, I...
I just can't run any faster.</i>

56:29.231 --> 56:31.298
Come on, Big Dog.

56:31.300 --> 56:34.134
Big Dog.

56:34.136 --> 56:37.170
Come on. Come on.

56:37.172 --> 56:39.906
<i>I will never stop.</i>

56:39.908 --> 56:42.311
<i>I will never stop
looking for you.</i>

56:58.027 --> 57:01.964
<i>Day after day passed,
but no CJ.</i>

57:04.033 --> 57:07.301
<i>I don't know why
she left me behind.</i>

57:10.205 --> 57:12.906
<i>I waited so long.</i>

57:12.908 --> 57:16.343
<i>I got older and older.</i>

57:16.345 --> 57:20.215
<i>And when it was time, I knew.</i>

57:31.927 --> 57:36.865
<i>I guess I wasn't gonna be
with CJ in this life.</i>

57:47.476 --> 57:50.243
<i>I had a good life with Joe.</i>

57:50.245 --> 57:53.382
<i>But it was really hard knowing
CJ was out there without me.</i>

57:55.685 --> 57:58.854
<i>I knew our journey wasn't over.</i>

58:04.960 --> 58:06.960
<i>I came back small,</i>

58:06.962 --> 58:08.995
<i>but I was not gonna
let that stop me.</i>

58:08.997 --> 58:11.398
<i>I've been born
enough times now to know</i>

58:11.400 --> 58:15.202
<i>that when you're hungry,
you have got to fight for it.</i>

58:18.140 --> 58:20.374
<i>So, apparently,
my growing phase was over.</i>

58:20.376 --> 58:22.175
<i>I was gonna remain small.</i>

58:22.177 --> 58:24.144
<i>Cat-sized.</i>

58:24.146 --> 58:27.147
<i>If I was gonna find CJ,</i>

58:27.149 --> 58:30.317
<i>I was gonna need
a new strategy.</i>

58:30.319 --> 58:33.086
Look at you.
You are so cute.

58:33.088 --> 58:35.155
<i>Hey! I already belong to somebody.</i>

58:36.458 --> 58:38.959
We're really looking
for an older dog.

58:38.961 --> 58:40.561
I have the perfect dog for you.

58:40.563 --> 58:41.696
Mm.

58:41.698 --> 58:44.030
<i>Sorry about that.
Nothing personal.</i>

58:44.032 --> 58:45.566
Aw, how sweet.

58:45.568 --> 58:48.135
This little cutie
would fit in my purse.

58:48.137 --> 58:49.537
<i>Nope.</i>

58:49.539 --> 58:51.173
<i>Keep moving.</i>

58:53.108 --> 58:56.042
<i>Good going, old guy.</i>

58:56.044 --> 58:58.178
<i>Oh, she's gonna be tricky.</i>

58:59.516 --> 59:02.149
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

59:02.151 --> 59:04.519
<i>I know that sound.</i>

59:04.521 --> 59:06.054
<i>Could it be?</i>

59:08.390 --> 59:10.025
<i>I think it might be.</i>

59:11.493 --> 59:13.460
<i>What if it is?</i>

59:13.462 --> 59:15.295
I'm sorry, Max, but I'm gonna

59:15.297 --> 59:17.130
have to take you back
to the shelter.

59:17.132 --> 59:19.332
<i>I have to find out.</i>

59:19.334 --> 59:22.235
<i>I don't want to have
to do this, but...</i>

59:22.237 --> 59:24.572
- Ow! Oh, oh! Max!
- <i>Sorry. You've been great.</i>

59:24.574 --> 59:27.075
- <i>Thanks for all the food and water.</i>
- Max, Max!

59:37.486 --> 59:39.419
<i>Whoa. This place is huge.</i>

59:44.159 --> 59:46.359
<i>Out of my way.
Dog coming through.</i>

59:46.361 --> 59:48.028
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

01:00:00.476 --> 01:00:03.578
<i>Being small does have
some advantages.</i>

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:06.112
<i>Wow, that smells good.
Maybe just one lick.</i>

01:00:06.114 --> 01:00:07.314
<i>No, forget that.</i>

01:00:07.316 --> 01:00:09.416
<i>I cannot let her get away this time.</i>

01:00:09.418 --> 01:00:10.651
<i>I can't see a thing.</i>

01:00:10.653 --> 01:00:12.419
<i>I need to get to higher ground.</i>

01:00:12.421 --> 01:00:14.622
...Square
Park is a 9.7-acre park...

01:00:14.624 --> 01:00:16.557
<i>Oh, yeah! There she is!</i>

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:26.066
Afternoon.

01:00:26.068 --> 01:00:27.234
<i>My legs are short but fast.</i>

01:00:27.236 --> 01:00:28.268
<i>I'm not gonna lose you
this time.</i>

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.340
Hey.

01:00:33.342 --> 01:00:36.142
<i>CJ. My CJ.</i>

01:00:36.144 --> 01:00:37.177
<i>I found you.</i>

01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:38.278
Oh, hello.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.446
What you doing?

01:00:44.152 --> 01:00:45.418
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Come here.

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.256
Ugh, how do you get
this thing off?

01:00:53.161 --> 01:00:54.562
<i>Here I am.</i>

01:00:54.564 --> 01:00:55.565
<i>Here to protect you.</i>

01:00:57.165 --> 01:00:59.399
<i>Still delicious.</i>

01:00:59.401 --> 01:01:01.336
Where did you come from?

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.507
Ah, thank you.

01:01:06.509 --> 01:01:08.341
- Hey.
- Oh. -

01:01:08.343 --> 01:01:10.878
Think there was a jailbreak.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.245
Is that Max?

01:01:12.247 --> 01:01:13.514
Oh, Max.

01:01:13.516 --> 01:01:15.248
You are such a love dog, Max.

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:16.584
You're the only person
in the world

01:01:16.586 --> 01:01:17.885
he hasn't tried to bite.

01:01:17.887 --> 01:01:20.220
It's like he chose you.

01:01:20.222 --> 01:01:22.289
I can't.
I-I live with my boyfriend,

01:01:22.291 --> 01:01:24.291
and he already has a dog.
I...

01:01:24.293 --> 01:01:27.127
I really can't bring home
another one.

01:01:27.129 --> 01:01:28.529
That's too bad.

01:01:28.531 --> 01:01:30.598
He's scheduled
to be put down tomorrow.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.599
Wait, are you serious?

01:01:31.601 --> 01:01:33.466
W-We do our best to foster out

01:01:33.468 --> 01:01:35.536
to no-kill shelters,
but they're full.

01:01:35.538 --> 01:01:37.203
We're full.

01:01:37.205 --> 01:01:39.507
Max is taking a place
that could go to another dog.

01:01:39.509 --> 01:01:41.509
- Oh, but you can't...
- Rescue's like a river.

01:01:41.511 --> 01:01:43.478

or it backs up.

Duke?

Ah-ah-ah-ah. Sit.

01:01:57.627 --> 01:01:59.094
Okay.

01:02:00.495 --> 01:02:03.229
Sit, Max.

01:02:03.231 --> 01:02:05.566
<i>Yeah.
You sit, and you stay that way.</i>

01:02:05.568 --> 01:02:06.703
<i>Get me?</i>

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:09.704
This is Max.

01:02:09.706 --> 01:02:12.405
You two are gonna be
very good friends.

01:02:12.407 --> 01:02:13.774

Great personality.

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:56.784
He just needs a minute
to warm up.

01:02:56.786 --> 01:02:59.553
And Duke loves
having a playmate.

01:02:59.555 --> 01:03:01.589
And I guess playing your music
for two dogs is

01:03:01.591 --> 01:03:03.390
better than one dog, right?

01:03:03.392 --> 01:03:05.559
Right.
They're a good audience.

01:03:05.561 --> 01:03:07.728
Too bad dogs don't buy records.

01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:10.700
Look, I'm gonna play for people
when I'm ready. All right?

01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:22.308

- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:30.586 --> 01:03:33.654
- Whoa.
- Uh, so Ringo had a great time.

01:03:33.656 --> 01:03:35.756
- He, um, peed twice.
- Oh, great.

01:03:35.758 --> 01:03:37.290
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:03:37.292 --> 01:03:38.695

Hey!

01:03:47.704 --> 01:03:49.335
Sorry.

01:03:51.339 --> 01:03:54.340
Max, come back.

01:03:54.342 --> 01:03:55.377
Max.

01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:02.552
Max.

01:04:04.754 --> 01:04:06.620
<i>Trent!</i>

- Trent?

<i>Where's Rocky?</i>

01:04:09.659 --> 01:04:11.625
- Wow. What are you...?
- What are you...? I...

01:04:11.627 --> 01:04:14.360
This is so weird.

01:04:14.362 --> 01:04:17.297
My dog just dragged me here.

01:04:17.299 --> 01:04:18.599
But I don't know...

01:04:18.601 --> 01:04:20.634
Um, do you live here?

01:04:20.636 --> 01:04:22.603
Yeah, I just moved in. Uh...

01:04:22.605 --> 01:04:24.572
Who's this little guy?

01:04:24.574 --> 01:04:26.507
Oh, um, that's Max.
Be careful.

01:04:26.509 --> 01:04:27.842
He's not very friendly.

01:04:27.844 --> 01:04:30.343
<i>Oh, Trent,
I'm so glad to see you.</i>

01:04:30.345 --> 01:04:31.679
<i>Where's Rocky?</i>

01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:33.750
He seems pretty friendly to me.

01:04:36.786 --> 01:04:40.420
I can't believe
you're in New York.

01:04:40.422 --> 01:04:43.557
I never saw you
as a big-city guy.

01:04:43.559 --> 01:04:45.659
Well, I was in London
for a while.

01:04:45.661 --> 01:04:47.595
And when the opportunity
came up here,

01:04:47.597 --> 01:04:50.430
I thought to myself,
"Why not give it a try?"

01:04:50.432 --> 01:04:52.533
<i>My nose told me Rocky was gone.</i>

01:04:52.535 --> 01:04:53.901
<i>Poor Trent.</i>

01:04:53.903 --> 01:04:56.670
<i>A person can't be happy
without a dog.</i>

01:04:56.672 --> 01:04:58.939
Well, it's a pretty nice place.

01:04:58.941 --> 01:05:00.306
You must be doing okay.

01:05:00.308 --> 01:05:03.511
<i>I wonder what the snack
situation is here.</i>

01:05:03.513 --> 01:05:05.378
Sorry.

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.380
You know me.
I follow the rules.

01:05:07.382 --> 01:05:10.350
I always admired how you
didn't care about the rules.

01:05:10.352 --> 01:05:12.452
Mm. Yeah, well,
Gloria didn't exactly

01:05:12.454 --> 01:05:14.454
teach me to follow rules.

01:05:14.456 --> 01:05:15.689
How is your mom?

01:05:15.691 --> 01:05:17.691
Oh, I don't know.

01:05:17.693 --> 01:05:20.360
I haven't spoken to her
in years.

01:05:20.362 --> 01:05:21.562
Mm.

01:05:21.564 --> 01:05:23.130
How's the music career?

01:05:23.132 --> 01:05:24.665
Good. Yeah.

01:05:24.667 --> 01:05:26.500
I mean, it's hard.

01:05:26.502 --> 01:05:28.702
Plus, I'm walking
all these dogs now

01:05:28.704 --> 01:05:30.370
just to pay the bills.

01:05:30.372 --> 01:05:31.572
So it's...

01:05:31.574 --> 01:05:32.840
That's a relief.

01:05:32.842 --> 01:05:34.642
Uh, for a second,
I thought you'd become

01:05:34.644 --> 01:05:36.710
one of those
out-of-control dog ladies.

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.648
<i>CJ was happy,
and it made her laugh.</i>

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:42.550
<i>She never laughs with Barry.</i>

01:05:42.552 --> 01:05:44.652
All right, well,
I should probably get going.

01:05:44.654 --> 01:05:46.354
Yeah.

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:51.625
Hey, uh, my girlfriend
is coming in next weekend.

01:05:51.627 --> 01:05:53.727
Uh, maybe we could do
a double date

01:05:53.729 --> 01:05:54.995
with you and your boyfriend?

01:05:54.997 --> 01:05:56.931
Yeah, sure, we'd love that.

01:05:56.933 --> 01:05:58.464
Okay.

01:05:58.466 --> 01:06:00.668
Okay.

01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:04.404
<i>CJ seemed sad
after we left Trent.</i>

01:06:04.406 --> 01:06:06.607
<i>I could tell she wanted Trent
in our pack.</i>

01:06:06.609 --> 01:06:08.175
<i>So did I.</i>

01:06:08.177 --> 01:06:10.410
<i>Which meant...</i>

01:06:10.412 --> 01:06:13.747
<i>Barry had to go.</i>

01:06:13.749 --> 01:06:17.753
Hey. Hey, hey, hey! CJ!

01:06:22.625 --> 01:06:25.928
<i>Barry's.</i>

01:06:31.534 --> 01:06:32.967

01:06:32.969 --> 01:06:35.769
<i>I've been
holding this in all day,</i>

01:06:35.771 --> 01:06:37.605
<i>and it's go time.</i>

01:06:46.949 --> 01:06:48.549
CJ!

01:06:48.551 --> 01:06:49.719
<i>Yes!</i>

01:06:52.655 --> 01:06:54.855
<i>Just saying,
if I have to bite this guy</i>

01:06:54.857 --> 01:06:56.824
<i>to get rid of him,
I absolutely will.</i>

01:06:56.826 --> 01:06:59.894
Adopting a dog
was such a stupid decision.

01:06:59.896 --> 01:07:01.530
Why are you saying that?

01:07:02.665 --> 01:07:04.531
Look at you, CJ.

01:07:04.533 --> 01:07:06.466
Your career is nowhere.

01:07:06.468 --> 01:07:07.534
Okay, thanks, Barry.

01:07:07.536 --> 01:07:09.637
I don't need any help
feeling bad about myself.

01:07:09.639 --> 01:07:12.541
Yeah, well, I just don't think
you have what it takes.

01:07:14.677 --> 01:07:16.812
I don't want to be here
anymore.

01:07:17.914 --> 01:07:19.613
Where are you gonna go?

01:07:19.615 --> 01:07:21.715
You gave up your apartment.
You have no money.

01:07:21.717 --> 01:07:23.951
Yeah, well,
I will figure something out.

01:07:23.953 --> 01:07:26.553
- Don't walk away from me.
- Don't touch me.

01:07:30.526 --> 01:07:34.528
<i>We... don't... like... you.</i>

01:07:35.698 --> 01:07:37.097

Amanda comes back next Tuesday.

01:07:52.748 --> 01:07:54.748
She said it would be okay.

Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:09:35.818 --> 01:09:37.885
Um, hey, so I left you
a bunch of messages.

01:09:37.886 --> 01:09:39.086
You didn't get back.

01:09:39.087 --> 01:09:41.087
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yeah.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:44.625
Yeah, sorry.
Um, everything's great.

01:09:44.627 --> 01:09:46.060
Really great, actually.

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:10.017
Ah. You can stay right here

01:10:10.019 --> 01:10:12.953
in the guest bedroom
until you find your own place.

01:10:14.190 --> 01:10:18.025
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be such a pain.

01:10:18.027 --> 01:10:19.860
You're not being a pain.

01:10:19.862 --> 01:10:22.930
I just need a little time
to get back on my feet.

01:10:22.932 --> 01:10:24.865
Um, Trent?

01:10:24.867 --> 01:10:26.867
Can I speak with you
for a second?

01:10:28.871 --> 01:10:31.138
Okay.

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:33.107
<i>Hmm.</i>

01:10:33.109 --> 01:10:35.878
<i>I guess that dog
doesn't know how to walk.</i>

01:10:37.913 --> 01:10:40.080
Feel like maybe
I'm getting you into trouble.

01:10:40.082 --> 01:10:41.882
It's fine.

01:10:41.884 --> 01:10:44.053
Liesl can be a little jealous.

01:10:46.722 --> 01:10:48.722
Hey, is it okay if we sit down?

01:10:48.724 --> 01:10:50.023
I'm exhausted.

01:10:50.025 --> 01:10:51.758
Yeah, sure.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.727
You okay?

01:10:53.729 --> 01:10:55.963
Yeah. Yeah, just, uh...

01:10:55.965 --> 01:10:58.232
think I'm working too much.

01:10:58.234 --> 01:11:00.067
- Oh.
- Excuse me.

01:11:00.069 --> 01:11:03.170
So, Trent tells me that you're
a professional dog walker.

01:11:03.172 --> 01:11:04.738
<i>What happened to you?</i>

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.173
Oh, yeah.

01:11:06.175 --> 01:11:07.774
Uh, just on the side.

01:11:07.776 --> 01:11:10.210
Um, music is what
I really care about.

01:11:10.212 --> 01:11:12.045
Oh, so you have a band?

01:11:12.047 --> 01:11:13.313
Nope. No band.

01:11:13.315 --> 01:11:15.215
Just me and my guitar.

01:11:15.217 --> 01:11:16.917
- Oh, where do you play?
- Uh, well,

01:11:16.919 --> 01:11:18.919
I haven't exactly
booked a gig yet.

01:11:18.921 --> 01:11:20.787
Kind of just been working
on my songs.

01:11:20.789 --> 01:11:22.156
I wanted to have a whole set

01:11:22.158 --> 01:11:23.790
before I started playing
in public.

01:11:23.792 --> 01:11:26.326
Oh. So, I mean,
music is on the side,

01:11:26.328 --> 01:11:30.166
and dog walking is
your real job, then, right?

01:11:33.936 --> 01:11:35.269
<i>Liesl didn't pee on anything,</i>

01:11:35.271 --> 01:11:38.338
<i>but she was definitely
marking her territory.</i>

01:11:43.145 --> 01:11:44.278
<i>Ready for food here.</i>

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.280
<i>Let's go. Put the bowl down.</i>

01:11:46.282 --> 01:11:48.115
Okay, okay.

01:11:48.117 --> 01:11:50.184
Ah. Sit.

01:11:50.186 --> 01:11:51.952
Good boy.

01:11:53.989 --> 01:11:56.757
<i>Oh, this is delicious.
Best meal ever.</i>

01:11:56.759 --> 01:11:58.025
Whoa. Slow down, Max.

01:11:58.027 --> 01:11:59.092
<i>I'm done.</i>

01:12:00.796 --> 01:12:02.930
<i>Trent!</i>

01:12:02.932 --> 01:12:04.532
Tough day?

01:12:04.534 --> 01:12:06.802
Not too bad.

01:12:09.038 --> 01:12:11.238
Think I just need some sleep.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.841
- Yeah, I bet.
- Oh, hey, little guy.

01:12:14.843 --> 01:12:17.044
<i>I literally just had
the best meal of my life.</i>

01:12:17.947 --> 01:12:20.347
<i>Good to have Trent back
in the pack.</i>

01:12:20.349 --> 01:12:22.985
Can I say something
you may not want to hear?

01:12:24.119 --> 01:12:25.319
Sure.

01:12:25.321 --> 01:12:27.555
I think you have stage fright.

01:12:27.557 --> 01:12:29.957
<i>Wait, that smell.</i>

01:12:29.959 --> 01:12:31.825
I...

01:12:32.861 --> 01:12:34.361
Okay, fine.

01:12:34.363 --> 01:12:38.999
Maybe I have
a little stage fright.

01:12:39.001 --> 01:12:40.834
But... well, I don't know.

01:12:40.836 --> 01:12:43.170
Maybe my songs
just aren't ready yet.

01:12:43.172 --> 01:12:45.239
Hmm. Well...

01:12:45.241 --> 01:12:48.942
<i>I remember that smell
from when I was Molly.</i>

01:12:48.944 --> 01:12:50.344
How will you know
whether they're ready

01:12:50.346 --> 01:12:52.145
if you don't play them?

01:12:52.147 --> 01:12:53.581
Right?

01:12:57.152 --> 01:12:58.819
Oh.

01:12:58.821 --> 01:13:00.988
That's a cute little trick.

01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:02.889
<i>I smelled the smell.
Now I get a treat.</i>

01:13:02.891 --> 01:13:04.293
You see that?

01:13:11.934 --> 01:13:13.902
Wow.

01:13:18.007 --> 01:13:21.977
Trent, how long have you
been wiped out like this?

01:13:23.045 --> 01:13:24.980
"Wiped out"?

01:13:26.616 --> 01:13:28.616
Um...

01:13:28.618 --> 01:13:30.618
actually...

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.855
since I moved back from London.

01:13:34.923 --> 01:13:38.125
I guess I'm...
I'm just jet-lagged.

01:13:38.127 --> 01:13:40.861
You... do you think maybe
you should see a doctor?

01:13:40.863 --> 01:13:43.063
Just to make sure
everything's okay?

01:13:43.065 --> 01:13:45.932
You're changing the subject
from your musical career.

01:13:45.934 --> 01:13:48.201
I am gonna think
about that, okay?

01:13:48.203 --> 01:13:50.806
Will you just please
go see a doctor?

01:13:52.875 --> 01:13:55.242
- Okay.
- <i>Excuse me.</i>

01:13:55.244 --> 01:13:57.913
<i>You owe me a treat.</i>

01:14:04.219 --> 01:14:07.890
Gloria, stop calling me.

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:13.226
♪ There's a girl... ♪

01:14:13.228 --> 01:14:15.663
Come in.

01:14:15.665 --> 01:14:17.898
Hey, uh, Liesl's here.

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:19.099
Could you come out?

01:14:19.101 --> 01:14:20.934
I want to tell you both
something.

01:14:20.936 --> 01:14:22.838
Sure.

01:14:28.077 --> 01:14:31.013
And they're sure it's cancer?

01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:34.114
They're sure.

01:14:34.116 --> 01:14:38.251
What did they tell you
about treatment options?

01:14:38.253 --> 01:14:41.522
Well, the good news is, uh,
they caught it early.

01:14:41.524 --> 01:14:43.459
But I'll have to do chemo.

01:14:46.328 --> 01:14:48.395
Do you have to go
to the hospital?

01:14:48.397 --> 01:14:50.130
I hate hospitals.
They terrify me.

01:14:50.132 --> 01:14:52.199
You know that.

01:14:52.201 --> 01:14:54.368
Then definitely
don't get cancer.

01:14:56.539 --> 01:14:59.039
Why are you laughing?

01:14:59.041 --> 01:15:02.309
Hey, hey, it was...
it was just a joke.

01:15:02.311 --> 01:15:05.080
Do you really think that this
is the time to joke?

01:15:07.116 --> 01:15:10.052
I... I need some air.

01:15:14.524 --> 01:15:16.458
It'll be okay.

01:15:29.739 --> 01:15:32.172
Thanks.

01:15:32.174 --> 01:15:34.975
And what did she say?

01:15:34.977 --> 01:15:38.147
She said she's not up
for being a nurse.

01:15:40.182 --> 01:15:42.349
Wow.

01:15:42.351 --> 01:15:45.053
That is pretty cold.

01:15:48.457 --> 01:15:51.057
Ugh. Sorry.

01:15:51.059 --> 01:15:53.126
Maybe it's for the better.

01:15:53.128 --> 01:15:56.298
She'd probably find some way of
making it about herself anyway.

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.601
Hey.

01:16:04.273 --> 01:16:06.275
You know you're gonna
beat this.

01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:09.546
Right?

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:13.146
Definitely.

01:16:13.148 --> 01:16:15.083
I-I think.

01:16:17.152 --> 01:16:19.354
I-I still can't believe this.

01:16:21.423 --> 01:16:23.358
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

01:16:25.093 --> 01:16:26.563
Thanks, CJ.

01:16:28.063 --> 01:16:30.098
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:16:40.409 --> 01:16:41.676
<i>Hmm.</i>

01:16:41.678 --> 01:16:44.277
<i>They remind me of Ethan and
Hannah when they were young.</i>

01:16:44.279 --> 01:16:47.115
<i>Ooh, do they want
to lick each other?</i>

01:16:52.154 --> 01:16:54.555
Hey, I got to go
to the hospital, Max.

01:16:54.557 --> 01:16:57.390
When I get back,
we'll go on a long walk, okay?

01:16:57.392 --> 01:17:00.126
<i>Trent went away,
and then CJ was gone a lot.</i>

01:17:01.396 --> 01:17:03.631
Ah. Stay, Max.

01:17:03.633 --> 01:17:06.567
<i>Why say "walk"
if you don't mean "walk"?</i>

01:17:09.404 --> 01:17:11.572
<i>Trent came home,
and he slept a lot.</i>

01:17:11.574 --> 01:17:15.043
<i>He slept even more than me.</i>

01:17:16.411 --> 01:17:18.546
Thank you.

01:17:18.548 --> 01:17:22.082
<i>And I'd been biting
at this itch for a long time.</i>

01:17:22.084 --> 01:17:24.685
Boy, you're really chewing
that spot, aren't you?

01:17:24.687 --> 01:17:28.321
Maybe I should take you
to the vet.

01:17:28.323 --> 01:17:30.058
Okay.

01:17:35.097 --> 01:17:36.396
So?

01:17:36.398 --> 01:17:38.398
It's really good.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.567
Really?

01:17:39.569 --> 01:17:41.468
No, it's horrible.

01:17:44.574 --> 01:17:47.075
- Here, I'm gonna try it.
- Uh...

01:17:51.446 --> 01:17:53.179
Oh, it's really bad.

01:17:53.181 --> 01:17:55.448
<i>Trent wore clothes for outside</i>

01:17:55.450 --> 01:17:56.817
<i>even though he always
stayed inside.</i>

01:17:56.819 --> 01:17:59.288
- It's healthy. Tastes healthy.
- <i>He looked ridiculous.</i>

01:18:01.524 --> 01:18:03.456
Aw, I'm sorry, Max.

01:18:03.458 --> 01:18:07.595
As soon as your leg heals,
we'll take it off, okay?

01:18:14.202 --> 01:18:17.672
I don't know, Max.

01:18:17.674 --> 01:18:20.206
Every time I think about
playing in public,

01:18:20.208 --> 01:18:23.476
my heart just starts racing.

01:18:23.478 --> 01:18:25.345
I don't know.

01:18:25.347 --> 01:18:28.083
Maybe I don't have
what it takes.

01:18:31.921 --> 01:18:36.323
<i>I wish this bed
was made out of bacon.</i>

01:18:39.394 --> 01:18:41.596
You accidentally
gave someone your key?

01:18:41.598 --> 01:18:44.464
<i>Does life get
any better than this?</i>

01:18:46.468 --> 01:18:48.303
It's the doctor.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.506
Hi, Dr. Robbins.

01:18:52.508 --> 01:18:55.342
Mm-hmm.

01:18:55.344 --> 01:18:57.513
Okay, so what does that mean?

01:19:00.650 --> 01:19:02.315
Okay.

01:19:02.317 --> 01:19:04.252
Thank you. Will do.

01:19:07.322 --> 01:19:09.422
What did she say?

01:19:09.424 --> 01:19:12.361
Sh-Sh-She said my...
my scans were clean.

01:19:15.263 --> 01:19:17.263
I'm cancer-free.

01:19:17.265 --> 01:19:18.633
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:19:18.635 --> 01:19:19.667
Oh, my God.

01:19:29.378 --> 01:19:30.511
<i>I don't know why we're happy,</i>

01:19:30.513 --> 01:19:31.646
<i>but it makes me happy.</i>

01:19:37.285 --> 01:19:39.520
Come here. Come here.

01:19:44.994 --> 01:19:45.860
Right, right.

01:19:45.862 --> 01:19:47.561
<i>Trent came on our walks again.</i>

01:19:47.563 --> 01:19:50.330
<i>It was so great
having him back.</i>

01:19:50.332 --> 01:19:52.800
Gloria keeps texting me.

01:19:52.802 --> 01:19:54.669
She's coming to New York.

01:19:54.671 --> 01:19:56.336
You're gonna go see her?

01:19:56.338 --> 01:19:58.238
Ugh, I don't know.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.007
It's been years, you know?

01:20:00.009 --> 01:20:02.543
Plus, she makes me feel
terrible about myself.

01:20:02.545 --> 01:20:04.377
She still has too much power
over you.

01:20:04.379 --> 01:20:05.780
If you see her up close,

01:20:05.782 --> 01:20:08.683
you'll just realize
she's just another person.

01:20:08.685 --> 01:20:10.452
Yeah, maybe you're right.

01:20:14.524 --> 01:20:16.423
You just got me through cancer.

01:20:16.425 --> 01:20:18.391
You can face Gloria.

01:20:18.393 --> 01:20:20.697
Hey, now I can be here for you.

01:20:24.299 --> 01:20:25.599
<i>Come on, lick faces.</i>

01:20:25.601 --> 01:20:28.336
Trent...

01:20:30.573 --> 01:20:33.176
<i>Do it. You both want to.</i>

01:20:36.546 --> 01:20:38.480
You're a really good friend.

01:20:42.051 --> 01:20:43.617
<i>Are they ever going to...</i>

01:20:43.619 --> 01:20:46.787
<i>I smell fresh poop!</i>

01:20:46.789 --> 01:20:48.756
Right this way.

01:20:48.758 --> 01:20:50.825
<i>I didn't understand</i>

01:20:50.827 --> 01:20:52.593
- <i>why CJ was trembling.</i>
- Thank you.

01:20:52.595 --> 01:20:55.696
<i>It wasn't windy or cold.</i>

01:20:55.698 --> 01:20:57.700
Hi.

01:20:58.768 --> 01:21:01.403
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:21:04.306 --> 01:21:05.474
Please, sit down.

01:21:08.343 --> 01:21:10.711
I'm sorry I had
to bring him with me.

01:21:10.713 --> 01:21:12.648
Oh, of course. That's okay.

01:21:15.518 --> 01:21:17.084
Oh, you're so beautiful.

01:21:17.086 --> 01:21:20.420
- Some water.
- Thank you.

01:21:20.422 --> 01:21:23.858
So, you've...
you've been living with Trent?

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:26.459
Is that...
Are you two... are you dating?

01:21:26.461 --> 01:21:27.561
Oh.

01:21:27.563 --> 01:21:29.930
Well, he always had
such a thing for you.

01:21:29.932 --> 01:21:33.636
No, we're, um...
we're just friends.

01:21:35.805 --> 01:21:38.873
And what is going on
with your music?

01:21:38.875 --> 01:21:42.676
Uh, just writing songs and...

01:21:42.678 --> 01:21:45.813
you know, thinking about
maybe making a demo.

01:21:45.815 --> 01:21:48.649
It's gonna be...

01:21:48.651 --> 01:21:51.417
scary to get up
in front of an audience.

01:21:51.419 --> 01:21:54.955
Yeah. Kind of wondering
if I'm cut out for it.

01:21:54.957 --> 01:21:57.392
Well, if you don't try,
you'll never know.

01:21:58.594 --> 01:22:00.561
So, what are you doing here,
Gloria?

01:22:00.563 --> 01:22:02.863
Just so you know,
I don't have any money.

01:22:02.865 --> 01:22:06.734
No, I don't want money
from you.

01:22:06.736 --> 01:22:09.136
<i>I felt a different
feeling from Gloria.</i>

01:22:09.138 --> 01:22:11.505
<i>Not angry. Sad.</i>

01:22:11.507 --> 01:22:13.574
- Max, she hates dogs.
- Oh, God.

01:22:13.576 --> 01:22:16.311
Can I... can I hold him?

01:22:17.547 --> 01:22:19.647
Yeah.

01:22:19.649 --> 01:22:22.683
Ah. Hey.
Want to come s-sit with me?

01:22:22.685 --> 01:22:25.686
<i>If anybody ever needed a dog,</i>

01:22:25.688 --> 01:22:26.921
- <i>it was Gloria.</i>
- Oh. Ah!

01:22:26.923 --> 01:22:28.490
<i>She needed love.</i>

01:22:30.726 --> 01:22:33.459
It must be nice to have...

01:22:33.461 --> 01:22:37.497
something that loves you
like this, without conditions.

01:22:37.499 --> 01:22:39.869
Because you probably
really needed that.

01:22:42.572 --> 01:22:44.839
Yeah, I did.

01:22:44.841 --> 01:22:47.942
So, Clarity, I...

01:22:47.944 --> 01:22:51.477
I have been sober for, um,

01:22:51.479 --> 01:22:55.182
nine months and 13 days.

01:22:55.184 --> 01:22:57.417
And...

01:22:57.419 --> 01:22:59.655
I was not a good mother.

01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:05.895
And I am s-so sorry, Clarity.

01:23:07.563 --> 01:23:09.563
And...

01:23:09.565 --> 01:23:12.633
if you'd let me, I'd...

01:23:12.635 --> 01:23:15.538
really like to be
a part of your life.

01:23:18.507 --> 01:23:20.776
I really want to trust you,
Gloria.

01:23:24.614 --> 01:23:26.782
I just don't know if I can.

01:23:29.652 --> 01:23:32.720
So, it's your father's birthday
next week.

01:23:32.722 --> 01:23:34.622
I don't know if you knew that.

01:23:34.624 --> 01:23:37.825
Um, and you are about
to turn the age

01:23:37.827 --> 01:23:40.594
that he was when he died.

01:23:40.596 --> 01:23:43.030
Which is so crazy.

01:23:43.032 --> 01:23:45.666
Um...

01:23:50.706 --> 01:23:54.942
I have some, uh,
letters from him

01:23:54.944 --> 01:23:58.512
that he wrote to me
when I was pregnant...

01:23:58.514 --> 01:23:59.813
with you.

01:23:59.815 --> 01:24:01.815
Um...

01:24:01.817 --> 01:24:03.951
and your grandparents
gave them to me.

01:24:03.953 --> 01:24:07.788
And I...
I think you should have them.

01:24:13.663 --> 01:24:15.963
I was so angry when he died.

01:24:15.965 --> 01:24:18.532
And... scared.

01:24:18.534 --> 01:24:21.635
And I was just... lost.

01:24:21.637 --> 01:24:24.972
But, um, I realize now

01:24:24.974 --> 01:24:27.741
it is so important
that you know who he was.

01:24:27.743 --> 01:24:30.780
Because he was...

01:24:33.683 --> 01:24:35.883
I don't want to read these,
Gloria.

01:24:35.885 --> 01:24:37.685
Oh, yes, you do.

01:24:37.687 --> 01:24:39.119
Yeah.

01:24:39.121 --> 01:24:41.691
Just trust me
on that one thing.

01:24:43.759 --> 01:24:46.694
And, um...

01:24:46.696 --> 01:24:48.798
I know it-it may take time.

01:24:50.866 --> 01:24:54.969
I do hope that someday
you can forgive me.

01:24:58.007 --> 01:25:01.075
<i>Turns out Gloria's a
pretty good ear scratcher, too.</i>

01:25:01.077 --> 01:25:04.513
<i>Maybe there is hope for her,
after all.</i>

01:25:06.582 --> 01:25:08.849
<i>The papers smelled
like Hannah's boy.</i>

01:25:08.851 --> 01:25:12.888
<i>They made me think of Ethan
and Hannah and the farm.</i>

01:25:14.724 --> 01:25:17.858
<i>Gloria, I miss you.</i>

01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:20.761
<i>I think I'm gonna get
the Motorola job.</i>

01:25:20.763 --> 01:25:23.063
<i>I saw an apartment
next to a park</i>

01:25:23.065 --> 01:25:25.833
<i>that would be perfect
for the baby.</i>

01:25:25.835 --> 01:25:27.601
<i>I know we're both scared,</i>

01:25:27.603 --> 01:25:29.670
<i>but I finally have
some clarity.</i>

01:25:29.672 --> 01:25:32.106
<i>We're so young, and we don't
know what we're doing.</i>

01:25:32.108 --> 01:25:33.907
<i>But we have each other,</i>

01:25:33.909 --> 01:25:36.710
<i>and we will figure it out
together.</i>

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:40.047
<i>We can spend the summer
with my mom and Ethan</i>

01:25:40.049 --> 01:25:41.081
<i>at the farm in Michigan.</i>

01:25:41.083 --> 01:25:44.918
<i>I know my mom will be
super helpful to us.</i>

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:49.023
<i>She is so excited
to be a grandmother.</i>

01:25:49.025 --> 01:25:53.127
<i>I cannot wait to meet
our little girl.</i>

01:25:53.129 --> 01:25:56.764
<i>How do you raise a child
to be strong and bold?</i>

01:25:56.766 --> 01:25:58.932
<i>To believe in herself?</i>

01:25:58.934 --> 01:26:01.969
<i>She'll have a good start
with you as her mom.</i>

01:26:01.971 --> 01:26:05.773
<i>I have so many dreams for her and for us.</i>

01:26:05.775 --> 01:26:08.909
Can't believe I'm taking
my mother's advice, but...

01:26:10.746 --> 01:26:14.214
...if I don't try it,
I'll never know, will I, Max?

01:26:14.216 --> 01:26:16.717
- Will I?
- <i>Sometimes the best thing you can do</i>

01:26:16.719 --> 01:26:18.052
<i>is just be there.</i>

01:26:18.054 --> 01:26:19.186
<i>Even if your ribs get</i>

01:26:19.188 --> 01:26:22.056

01:27:58.787 --> 01:27:59.820
Oh!

01:27:59.822 --> 01:28:01.188
You did it.

01:28:02.825 --> 01:28:04.491
I'm so proud of you.

01:28:04.493 --> 01:28:06.059
Hey, don't you feel good?

01:28:06.061 --> 01:28:09.163
I, uh... I feel relieved.

01:28:09.165 --> 01:28:10.831
That song about
your grandparents' farm

01:28:10.833 --> 01:28:12.266
really got to me.

01:28:12.268 --> 01:28:14.134
Uh, have you even been there?

01:28:14.136 --> 01:28:17.037
Just when I was a baby, but...

01:28:17.039 --> 01:28:18.939
I don't know.
Reading my dad's letters,

01:28:18.941 --> 01:28:20.941
I kind of felt like
I remembered it.

01:28:20.943 --> 01:28:23.944
I've been trying to think
of a way to repay you and Max.

01:28:23.946 --> 01:28:26.213
Tonight just gave me
this crazy idea.

01:28:26.215 --> 01:28:28.918
Would you be up
for a road trip?

01:28:34.089 --> 01:28:37.057
<i>I love car rides,
but why am I tied down?</i>

01:28:37.059 --> 01:28:39.295
<i>I really would like to put
my head out the window.</i>

01:28:40.996 --> 01:28:44.033
He loves car rides.

01:28:50.272 --> 01:28:51.539
<i>These smells.</i>

01:28:51.541 --> 01:28:52.806
<i>Could it be?</i>

01:28:56.946 --> 01:28:58.812
Can't believe I said yes
to this.

01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:04.284
I think it's best to say yes
whenever possible.

01:29:04.286 --> 01:29:05.886
Don't you think?

01:29:07.056 --> 01:29:08.889
Okay.

01:29:08.891 --> 01:29:10.891
Well, I wonder what
a city dog's

01:29:10.893 --> 01:29:12.259
gonna make of this place.

01:29:12.261 --> 01:29:14.261
<i>The farm! I'm back!</i>

01:29:14.263 --> 01:29:16.096
Should we check it out?

01:29:16.098 --> 01:29:17.231
Whoa.

01:29:17.233 --> 01:29:19.266
<i>I smell horse-dogs!</i>

01:29:19.268 --> 01:29:23.003
<i>I smell Hannah!
I smell my boy!</i>

01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:36.083
Hello.

01:29:36.085 --> 01:29:38.120
Where'd you come from?

01:29:41.123 --> 01:29:43.123
<i>Ethan, it's me!</i>

01:29:43.125 --> 01:29:44.424
<i>It's Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, Bailey.</i>

01:29:44.426 --> 01:29:46.994
Ethan, wh-what's
going on out here?

01:29:46.996 --> 01:29:48.328
- What...?
- Look at this.

01:29:50.165 --> 01:29:52.332
Aren't you a cutie pie?

01:29:55.204 --> 01:29:56.972
Who is your owner?

01:30:00.242 --> 01:30:02.044
Hi.

01:30:05.247 --> 01:30:07.314
I think...

01:30:07.316 --> 01:30:10.786
you might be my Grandma Hannah?

01:30:12.054 --> 01:30:13.320
I am.

01:30:13.322 --> 01:30:14.888
CJ?

01:30:18.927 --> 01:30:21.128
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:30:30.105 --> 01:30:33.340
God, I feel like
I know this place.

01:30:33.342 --> 01:30:35.075
Of course you do.

01:30:35.077 --> 01:30:37.311
It's home.

01:30:37.313 --> 01:30:38.445
CJ?

01:30:38.447 --> 01:30:40.414
Y-You grew up.

01:30:43.118 --> 01:30:45.419
I-Is that... is that your dog?

01:30:45.421 --> 01:30:48.088
- Oh, yeah, that's, um... this is Max.
- Good.

01:30:48.090 --> 01:30:50.157
Oh, be careful.
He's not very friendly.

01:30:50.159 --> 01:30:52.959
Ooh.
Oh, yeah, you're a killer.

01:30:52.961 --> 01:30:55.195
- Oh. Wow. Okay.
- Oh... oh, yeah, yeah.

01:30:55.197 --> 01:30:56.330
Wow.

01:30:56.332 --> 01:30:57.497
<i>I did what you told me, Ethan.</i>

01:30:57.499 --> 01:31:00.067
<i>It was not easy. It took
a long time, but I did it.</i>

01:31:00.069 --> 01:31:01.268
<i>I brought CJ home.</i>

01:31:02.371 --> 01:31:04.338
Aw.

01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:07.374
- Aw.
- Hello.

01:31:07.376 --> 01:31:10.043
Oh. Hi.

01:31:10.045 --> 01:31:11.947
Nice to meet you.

01:31:15.417 --> 01:31:17.217
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, that's beautiful.

01:31:17.219 --> 01:31:18.985
Look at that.

01:31:18.987 --> 01:31:20.320
Look at this one.

01:31:22.257 --> 01:31:24.491
Oh, wow.

01:31:24.493 --> 01:31:27.961
So, how long have you two
known each other?

01:31:27.963 --> 01:31:29.463
- Oh, um...
- Uh...

01:31:29.465 --> 01:31:31.264
Best friends
since we were ten years old.

01:31:31.266 --> 01:31:32.332
Mm-hmm.

01:31:32.334 --> 01:31:34.935
- Oh.
- So, you're not, uh...

01:31:34.937 --> 01:31:37.003
Oh, no. No.

01:31:37.005 --> 01:31:39.007
We're, um...
we're just friends.

01:31:40.275 --> 01:31:41.410
Mm.

01:31:44.012 --> 01:31:46.514
Gosh, I look so happy.

01:31:46.516 --> 01:31:50.150
Why did my mother
keep me away from you?

01:31:50.152 --> 01:31:52.419
Oh...

01:31:52.421 --> 01:31:55.422
When your father died,
Gloria was so young,

01:31:55.424 --> 01:31:59.960
and I think she thought
that the world was against her.

01:31:59.962 --> 01:32:04.030
And she couldn't see
that we were on her side.

01:32:04.032 --> 01:32:06.168
Right?

01:32:07.436 --> 01:32:10.370
I'm gonna get
some more photo albums.

01:32:10.372 --> 01:32:12.305
- Here. Take Bailey.
- Oh.

01:32:12.307 --> 01:32:15.976
- His-his name's Max.
- Oh.

01:32:15.978 --> 01:32:18.513
Okay... Max.

01:32:18.515 --> 01:32:22.215
You know,
his real name is Bailey.

01:32:22.217 --> 01:32:24.451
Ain't that right, Boss Dog?

01:32:24.453 --> 01:32:26.253
That's right.

01:32:26.255 --> 01:32:29.089
<i>I love when he
calls me "Boss Dog."</i>

01:32:29.091 --> 01:32:30.424
The only thing I can't figure

01:32:30.426 --> 01:32:33.193
is how Boss Dog can be
such a little guy.

01:32:33.195 --> 01:32:35.362
Mm-hmm.

01:32:35.364 --> 01:32:38.064
Wait, so, my dog
is actually your dog?

01:32:38.066 --> 01:32:40.768
He's on permanent loan.

01:32:40.770 --> 01:32:42.402
To you.

01:32:42.404 --> 01:32:44.106
Okay.

01:32:48.010 --> 01:32:51.478
Bailey was Ethan's dog
when he was a kid,

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:55.616
and he always said that Bailey
came back as a different dog

01:32:55.618 --> 01:32:59.252
and brought us back together
after many years apart.

01:32:59.254 --> 01:33:02.590
And now he thinks
that Max is Bailey

01:33:02.592 --> 01:33:05.258
and Bailey's brought you to us.

01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:06.561
She thinks I lost my marbles.

01:33:06.563 --> 01:33:09.262
Oh, well...

01:33:09.264 --> 01:33:10.798
Yeah, you do.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:14.802
- I know what I'm talking about on this one.
- Mm-hmm. Sure.

01:33:14.804 --> 01:33:17.572
You don't believe me,
either, CJ, do you?

01:33:20.476 --> 01:33:23.111
There's a lot you don't know
about that dog.

01:33:25.815 --> 01:33:27.983
I could show you.

01:33:30.653 --> 01:33:34.154
- Come on, Bailey.
- <i>Coming.</i>

01:33:34.156 --> 01:33:36.091
Okay.

01:33:41.263 --> 01:33:43.296
Yeah, it's been
a while since I've done this.

01:33:43.298 --> 01:33:45.533
I used to do it standing up.

01:33:45.535 --> 01:33:47.535
All right, you...

01:33:47.537 --> 01:33:49.236
Okay, you ready?

01:33:49.238 --> 01:33:51.839
<i>Let's do it
just like we used to.</i>

01:33:51.841 --> 01:33:53.406
Huh? Okay.

01:33:53.408 --> 01:33:54.609
One.

01:33:56.178 --> 01:33:58.144
Two.

01:33:58.146 --> 01:33:59.549
Three. Go!

01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:09.557
<i>When did this thing get so big?</i>

01:34:15.130 --> 01:34:16.697
Pr-Pretty great, right?

01:34:16.699 --> 01:34:19.199
Wha...?

01:34:19.201 --> 01:34:21.334
Only... only now the...

01:34:21.336 --> 01:34:24.505
The football
weighs more than he does.

01:34:24.507 --> 01:34:25.673
Wait.

01:34:25.675 --> 01:34:27.240
How did...

01:34:27.242 --> 01:34:30.312
I don't know how or what.

01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:33.380
When Bailey died,

01:34:33.382 --> 01:34:35.716
I told him to take care of you.

01:34:35.718 --> 01:34:38.418
To protect you.

01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:41.290
And I believe
that's what he did.

01:34:43.191 --> 01:34:46.295
Ain't that right, Boss Dog?

01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:51.433
It's kind of weird
when you finally get it, right?

01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.441
Trent?

01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:01.909
Trent!

01:35:01.911 --> 01:35:03.176
<i>He's over there.</i>

01:35:03.178 --> 01:35:04.477
<i>Uh, uh, I got to go, Ethan.</i>

01:35:04.479 --> 01:35:06.481
<i>You told me to protect her.</i>

01:35:27.436 --> 01:35:29.672
Trent. Trent!

01:35:31.373 --> 01:35:33.708
Wh-What is it? What's wrong?

01:35:36.378 --> 01:35:37.580
Nothing.

01:35:38.948 --> 01:35:40.282
Nothing's wrong.

01:35:49.324 --> 01:35:51.759
Max was Molly, Trent.

01:35:51.761 --> 01:35:53.527
That's how he knew
you were sick.

01:35:53.529 --> 01:35:56.597
- What?
- Max was Molly.

01:35:56.599 --> 01:35:59.567
And before Molly,
he was Ethan's dog, Bailey.

01:35:59.569 --> 01:36:02.503
And I think he was also
Big Dog,

01:36:02.505 --> 01:36:05.773
who gave me its paw
and helped me win 50 dollars.

01:36:05.775 --> 01:36:07.541
Uh, okay.

01:36:09.311 --> 01:36:11.413
Max brought us together, Trent.

01:36:12.815 --> 01:36:16.517
He found me,
and then he found you,

01:36:16.519 --> 01:36:20.420
and then he saved your life.

01:36:20.422 --> 01:36:22.422
All so we could be together.

01:36:22.424 --> 01:36:23.658
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:25.793
<i>Would you just
lick faces already?</i>

01:36:25.795 --> 01:36:28.361
Is it possible?

01:36:28.363 --> 01:36:29.563
No.

01:36:29.565 --> 01:36:31.701
No, it's utterly impossible.

01:36:33.235 --> 01:36:35.237
But I guess it's true.

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.242
I love you, Trent.

01:36:42.011 --> 01:36:45.345
I've always loved you.

01:36:45.347 --> 01:36:47.717
I've loved you forever.

01:36:54.557 --> 01:36:56.224
<i>Finally.</i>

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.840
Hey.

01:37:12.842 --> 01:37:14.608
Thank you, Max.

01:37:14.610 --> 01:37:16.476
And Molly.

01:37:16.478 --> 01:37:18.779
And Bailey, and Big Dog.

01:37:18.781 --> 01:37:20.817
<i>Those are all me.</i>

01:37:24.587 --> 01:37:26.421
Yeah.

01:37:29.792 --> 01:37:32.358
<i>I did what Ethan asked.</i>

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:35.629
<i>I watched after CJ so that
she would have a good life,</i>

01:37:35.631 --> 01:37:38.532
- <i>with a good pack.</i>
- Wow.

01:37:38.534 --> 01:37:40.768
It looks great.

01:37:40.770 --> 01:37:42.870
Hey, you want to hear a song
I wrote about you, Max?

01:37:42.872 --> 01:37:46.372
<i>I never got tired
of hearing CJ say my name.</i>

01:37:48.343 --> 01:37:50.911
<i>I had a lot of lives.</i>

01:37:50.913 --> 01:37:52.680
<i>All different.</i>

01:37:52.682 --> 01:37:54.682
<i>Sometimes I was big,</i>

01:37:54.684 --> 01:37:57.685
<i>and sometimes I was small.</i>

01:37:57.687 --> 01:38:00.554
Oh. Oh, here's Mama.

01:38:00.556 --> 01:38:03.389
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, hey. How you doing?

01:38:03.391 --> 01:38:04.658
- How you doing?
- Come here.

01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:06.660
- Kiss.
- Hey, there.

01:38:06.662 --> 01:38:07.895
Let's go see the dog.

01:38:07.897 --> 01:38:10.564
<i>So many ups and downs.</i>

01:38:10.566 --> 01:38:13.534
- <i>Even Gloria came around once in a while.</i>
- Yes.

01:38:13.536 --> 01:38:15.772
<i>I trained her to play.</i>

01:38:18.406 --> 01:38:20.841
Yeah. That's the puppy.

01:38:20.843 --> 01:38:23.476
Oh.

01:38:24.747 --> 01:38:27.415
<i>So many good-byes.</i>

01:38:36.692 --> 01:38:40.728
<i>He'd been with me so many times
when I had to leave.</i>

01:38:40.730 --> 01:38:44.732
<i>Now I got to be with him.</i>

01:38:44.734 --> 01:38:48.569
We release Ethan
Montgomery into your care.

01:38:48.571 --> 01:38:50.604
May the Lord bless you
and keep you.

01:38:50.606 --> 01:38:53.774
May the Lord's face shine
upon you and give you peace...

01:38:58.981 --> 01:39:02.516
<i>So many people.</i>

01:39:02.518 --> 01:39:05.853
<i>Through it all,
I let the people I loved</i>

01:39:05.855 --> 01:39:08.556
<i>know just how much
I loved them.</i>

01:39:08.558 --> 01:39:11.625
Hey. How's he doing?

01:39:11.627 --> 01:39:14.462
He's just been lying there
all day.

01:39:16.532 --> 01:39:18.701
You're a good boy, Max.

01:39:19.836 --> 01:39:22.603
The best.

01:39:22.605 --> 01:39:24.874
Where would we be without you?

01:39:30.746 --> 01:39:33.381
You're a good dog, Molly Max.

01:39:36.652 --> 01:39:39.589
You're such a good dog.

01:39:42.625 --> 01:39:45.491
<i>Lying there
with my girl holding me,</i>

01:39:45.493 --> 01:39:47.895
<i>I can feel it happening again.</i>

01:39:47.897 --> 01:39:50.564
<i>I knew I was saying good-bye,</i>

01:39:50.566 --> 01:39:52.766

<i>My name was Bailey.</i>

01:41:06.809 --> 01:41:11.712

and Big Dog, and Max.</i>

Hello, Boss Dog.

01:41:40.042 --> 01:41:41.775
Come on, boy.

01:41:41.777 --> 01:41:43.010
Come on.
Come on, buddy.

01:41:43.012 --> 01:41:44.979
Hey.

01:41:47.316 --> 01:41:49.083
All right. Ready?

01:41:49.085 --> 01:41:51.318
Ready? Go!

01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:54.822
Way to go, Boss Dog!
