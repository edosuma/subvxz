00:06.272 --> 00:07.762
Tssh!

00:10.343 --> 00:13.210
<i>Mirror, mirror on the wall
I ain't too short, I ain't too tall</i>

00:13.380 --> 00:14.677
<i>Damn, if I don't have it all</i>

00:14.848 --> 00:16.543
Come here.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.445
Where are you going?

00:20.620 --> 00:24.215
Oh, I finally got a date with Lori Williams
and I am on my way. How I look, huh?

00:24.391 --> 00:25.949
Uh, uh, boom!

00:26.126 --> 00:28.594
Uh... Fine.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.829
Uh... Fine?

00:32.332 --> 00:36.063
Well, I don't know.
I think it's that suit. It's kind of...

00:36.236 --> 00:37.430
Kind of what?

00:38.238 --> 00:42.402
It just has way too many buttons
and the color is very '95.

00:44.677 --> 00:47.168
Girl, you must be crazy. I look great.

00:47.347 --> 00:51.113
I'm the man when it comes to fashion.
I know when I look good. Shoot, girl, l...

00:51.284 --> 00:52.444
Hey, guys.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:01.194 --> 01:02.627
I'm gonna go ahead and change.

02:19.906 --> 02:25.242
Come on, everybody, your dad's on TV.
The jury's about to announce the verdict.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.077
Do you think she's innocent or guilty?

02:29.249 --> 02:33.208
Oh, please, that woman turned
more tricks than David Copperfield.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.454
She'll probably get off
with community service.

02:36.623 --> 02:40.889
Seems to me, community service is what
got her in this mess in the first place.

02:41.261 --> 02:42.387
Serving the community.

02:42.562 --> 02:45.725
- Y'all know what I'm talking about, right?
- Hey, hey, hey. Shh, shh, shh.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.560
<i>Has the jury reached a verdict?</i>

02:47.734 --> 02:49.361
<i>Yes, we have, Your Honor.</i>

02:55.842 --> 02:56.866
What is your verdict?

02:57.043 --> 03:01.810
We find the defendant, Tanya Bain, guilty
of all 23 counts of pandering.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.117
Order. Order.

03:06.152 --> 03:07.312
Mm, mm, mm.

03:07.487 --> 03:10.923
Boy, are there gonna be
a lot of Ionely guys this Friday night.

03:11.424 --> 03:14.655
<i>Miss Bain will be held at the
correctional facility until tomorrow...</i>

03:14.827 --> 03:18.285
<i>... when she will be returned here at 9:30
in the morning for sentencing.</i>

03:18.464 --> 03:20.557
<i>Court is adjourned.</i>

03:21.100 --> 03:22.863
Dad's liable to give her life.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.971
I got grounded for a whole month
just because I came home late.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.107
Well, you deserved it.

03:28.274 --> 03:32.472
I mean, getting everybody's hopes up
like that and then showing up again.

03:36.082 --> 03:38.778
This fax just came in.

03:38.952 --> 03:39.976
Oh, my God.

03:40.453 --> 03:41.545
What? What does it say?

03:41.721 --> 03:44.588
It says, "I'm gonna kill you, Banks."

03:44.824 --> 03:47.588
- Yo. It's a death threat against Uncle Phil.
What?

03:47.760 --> 03:49.421
- What?
Dad?

03:49.596 --> 03:52.759
Oh, thank God. I thought it was for me.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.063
The fax came
right after the verdict was announced.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.971
And they haven't stopped since.

04:04.143 --> 04:07.010
Oh, half of them wanna hang me,
half of them wanna hug me.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.841
There's a dude here from Appalachia.

04:09.015 --> 04:12.178
He says he thinks
your mouth is kind of pretty.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.582
Guess I'll put this in the hug pile.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.689
Whenever there's a high-profile case
like this...

04:19.858 --> 04:21.724
...every wacko
comes out of the woodwork.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.226
I say we treat this as a code-one priority.

04:24.397 --> 04:27.833
We need to seal the perimeter.
I want four cars on 24-hour surveillance...

04:28.001 --> 04:30.196
...sharpshooters on the roof,
and a canine team.

04:30.370 --> 04:34.067
And remember,
we're working with a nut here.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.342
And who are you?

04:37.744 --> 04:40.178
He's the nut we working with.
Heh-heh-heh.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.381
Carlton Banks. I'll be your point man
on this little operation.

04:43.549 --> 04:49.078
I'll tell you what, you let us do our job,
and we'll let you do whatever it is you do.

04:49.255 --> 04:52.850
And we'll send a extra car by, Mr. Banks,
just to make sure everything's safe.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.654
- Thank you, officer.
- Come on, guys.

04:56.095 --> 05:01.362
That's it? They're done? They're leaving?
Well, I, for one, am not gonna stand here...

05:01.534 --> 05:04.059
...and do nothing
while your life hangs in the balance.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.762
Son, my life is not hanging
in the balance.

05:06.939 --> 05:08.406
Now, wait a minute, Uncle Phil.

05:08.574 --> 05:11.702
I don't usually say this,
but I agree with the little squidget.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.542
Come on, you can't go down
to that courthouse by yourself.

05:16.716 --> 05:19.685
You need a bodyguard.
Hey, I'm your man.

05:19.852 --> 05:21.114
I'll be fine, Will.

05:21.287 --> 05:23.585
Uh-huh.
That's just what Bobo Anderson said.

05:23.756 --> 05:26.247
- Who?
- Bobo Anderson.

05:26.426 --> 05:28.417
One of my boys from back in Philly.

05:28.594 --> 05:31.563
Bobo started getting all these
threatening letters. Everybody was like:

05:31.731 --> 05:34.700
"You need to
watch your back. Brothers be tripping."

05:34.867 --> 05:37.802
He's like, "No, man,
I'm cool. I'm all right." Then, bam!

05:41.207 --> 05:43.437
One day he just up and disappeared.

05:43.609 --> 05:45.042
He was killed?

05:45.645 --> 05:49.103
No, his family moved out of town.
I ain't seen him since third grade.

05:50.817 --> 05:53.843
Will, what has all this got to do
with your being my bodyguard?

05:54.020 --> 05:57.547
Oh. I figure if you let me slide down
to that courtroom with you, you know...

05:57.724 --> 06:00.693
...I might get to console some of them
show-biz madam girls.

06:00.860 --> 06:04.421
You know, it won't be just your body
I'm guarding, you know what I'm saying?

06:04.597 --> 06:08.089
You know what I'm talking about, dawg.
You know what I'm saying, right?

06:08.267 --> 06:10.132
You know. You know what I'm saying.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.430
You know what I'm saying, right?
You know.

06:12.605 --> 06:15.369
You know what I'm saying, boy?
You know...

06:15.541 --> 06:18.237
Damn, I miss Bobo.

06:24.550 --> 06:29.578
Oh, Carlton, I still think it was a little early
to give up on the dating service.

06:30.523 --> 06:33.822
Will, meet Safety Guy.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.517
Safety Guy, what's up, bro?
What's going on, boy?

06:45.605 --> 06:48.938
Look, this happens to be the latest
in home and personal security.

06:49.108 --> 06:53.306
"Designed as a visual deterrent,
Safety Guy is a life-size simulated male."

06:53.479 --> 06:56.812
Hmm.
And you're a pint-size simulated male.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.107
Very funny.

06:58.284 --> 07:00.844
He's gonna protect the Big Guy
when we're not around.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.420
You mean to tell me
this thing can protect somebody?

07:03.589 --> 07:06.524
- Oh, absolutely.
- Hmm.

07:09.829 --> 07:13.128
Huh. He must be on a break, huh?

07:14.233 --> 07:16.531
Will, this is no time for tomfoolery.

07:16.702 --> 07:20.468
Now, take your walkie-talkie
and infrared goggles.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.536
Damn.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.176
Oh, my God.

07:25.344 --> 07:28.438
Yo, I can see right through your clothes
with these things.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.809
No wonder you're so shy.

07:36.823 --> 07:39.917
Ashley's out in the decoy vehicle
and this will be command central.

07:40.092 --> 07:42.526
This baby right here
will monitor all our activities.

07:42.695 --> 07:46.131
Your assignment is to be on this
24 hours a day. Have you read the manual?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.324
- Committed the frequency to memory?
- Check.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.163
- Now, what do you do if we get caught?
- Laugh.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.037
Oh, I see we have company.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.115
Who's your friend?

08:04.650 --> 08:07.813
- Hilary, he's a dummy.
- Heh.

08:07.987 --> 08:11.081
Who needs brains
when you got a body like that?

08:14.427 --> 08:17.726
Hey, Uncle Phil,
we are here to protect you.

08:17.897 --> 08:19.364
I don't need your protection.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.659
Negatory.
Until we get you to the courthouse...

08:21.834 --> 08:24.962
...we'll be watching your every move
and protecting you at all cost.

08:25.137 --> 08:28.004
Trust me, we are a well-oiled machine.

08:30.776 --> 08:35.337
Looks like your well-oiled machine
just ran out of gas.

08:43.121 --> 08:46.558
Biggest day of my professional career
and now I'm gonna be late.

08:46.726 --> 08:49.422
You should've stayed in the car.
We could've protected you.

08:49.595 --> 08:54.726
The only person who's gonna need
protection now is you, if you don't back off!

08:57.003 --> 08:59.528
He's just a little tense about the trial.

08:59.705 --> 09:03.266
Just let him bang down
a couple Ding Dongs. He'll be all right.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.135
Will...

09:07.446 --> 09:09.437
...get a load of the clown in the corner.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.083
We'd better check him out.

09:14.253 --> 09:16.278
Carlton, come on, he's a clown.

09:16.455 --> 09:19.322
He's probably going
to some kid's birthday party or something.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.483
We'll see about that.

09:21.661 --> 09:24.630
Okay, pal, state your business.

09:24.931 --> 09:25.955
Who are you?

09:26.132 --> 09:30.967
Never mind who I am. And wipe that smile
off your face and tell me your name.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.932
Juggles.

09:34.807 --> 09:39.210
Well, look, Juggles,
get what you're after and get out of here.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.074
Who are you?

09:41.247 --> 09:43.715
Carlton Banks.
And that's my father, Judge Banks.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.544
I'm the head of his security team...

09:45.718 --> 09:49.245
...and my job is to check out
suspicious people like you.

09:49.422 --> 09:53.222
So come on, let's go. Move it along.

09:54.493 --> 09:57.155
Judge Banks
from the Show-Biz Madam Trial?

09:57.830 --> 09:59.764
Pretty impressed, huh?

10:00.266 --> 10:02.700
More than you can imagine.

10:02.868 --> 10:08.602
All right! Nobody moves
and nobody gets blown up!

10:25.992 --> 10:27.983
- Excuse...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:29.295 --> 10:30.421
Mr. Juggles?

10:30.596 --> 10:35.260
Hey, hey, hey.
It's not Mr. Juggles, it's Juggles.

10:36.902 --> 10:39.496
All right, Will, I got a plan.

10:39.672 --> 10:44.371
You create a diversion
while Dad and I slip out the back.

10:47.246 --> 10:49.680
Hey, yo.
Hey, man, where does that leave me?

10:49.849 --> 10:52.340
You are so selfish.

10:53.119 --> 10:54.711
What do you hope to accomplish...

10:54.887 --> 10:58.015
...by strapping a bomb to your chest
and blowing up a gas station?

10:59.992 --> 11:02.324
I'm on my way down
to one of the networks...

11:02.495 --> 11:04.656
...and I'm gonna make them
put me on TV.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.789
And then the whole world is gonna see
my talent to entertain.

11:09.035 --> 11:13.301
Um... Wouldn't it be easier
to just get a agent?

11:14.707 --> 11:18.609
I had an agent and then he had my wife.
Heh.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.641
That's a joke!

11:28.187 --> 11:29.984
There's gotta be a better way.

11:30.156 --> 11:34.559
Yeah, well, I tried all the other ways,
but it's always Bozo this or Coco that.

11:34.727 --> 11:38.219
Never any jobs for Juggles, oh, no.
And I'll tell you another thing...

11:38.397 --> 11:43.699
...I could've sold twice as many hamburgers
as that Ronald guy. That no-act clown.

11:43.869 --> 11:49.102
No. No. Nobody wants
to give Juggles a chance. Mm-mm.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.972
One little tent fire.
One little elephant stampede.

11:53.145 --> 11:57.548
A couple of kids end up in the hospital
and, all of a sudden, Juggles is poison.

11:59.652 --> 12:05.318
As if they even saw me smoking that cigar.
It's harassment, I tell you!

12:07.626 --> 12:11.323
Well, you're probably in a hurry
to get down to that network, you know.

12:11.497 --> 12:12.657
So don't let us stop you.

12:12.832 --> 12:15.960
Grab your little seltzer bottle,
hop in your little miniature car.

12:16.135 --> 12:18.228
If you go right now,
you could beat rush hour.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.601
No! No, no, no. Oh, no.

12:21.774 --> 12:24.766
Now that I got myself
a big celebrity judge hostage...

12:24.944 --> 12:27.242
...I'm gonna make the network people
come here.

12:28.647 --> 12:32.583
I'll be a bigger celebrity
than I even thought.

12:36.922 --> 12:40.050
Now, I've heard enough.
This plan's never gonna work.

12:40.226 --> 12:43.320
Listen, clown, there are not gonna be
any news stations down here.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.988
Every station in the world is gonna be
at the courthouse waiting for my Dad.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.293
- Carlton...
- It's gonna be a media circus there.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.902
If you think any news camera people
are coming here...

12:52.071 --> 12:55.507
- Carlton...
- No, no, no. He should hear this.

12:56.342 --> 12:59.937
I mean, even the tabloids
are gonna be down at the courthouse.

13:00.379 --> 13:04.110
You know, he's right. This won't work.

13:06.919 --> 13:11.379
Yeah, you guys are going down
to the courthouse.

13:11.557 --> 13:14.549
Thank you. Thank you very much.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.257
- But I'm coming with you.
- Aah!

13:17.429 --> 13:20.023
Juggles, no!

13:22.535 --> 13:24.594
<i>What are we, Driving Miss Daisy?</i>

13:24.770 --> 13:29.002
Come on, speed it up a little.
I have a date with destiny.

13:29.241 --> 13:33.871
I'm trying to obey the law,
unlike someone else in this car.

13:34.046 --> 13:37.072
Pedal to the metal, Tattoo.

13:37.683 --> 13:40.379
And if I don't,
I suppose you'll throw me out the window...

13:40.553 --> 13:43.147
...just like you did Safety Guy.

13:43.923 --> 13:46.517
Oh, the sight of that
perfectly chiseled foam body...

13:46.692 --> 13:49.923
...being mutilated by that 18-wheeler.

13:50.429 --> 13:52.954
You bastard.

13:55.501 --> 13:59.130
All right, look, you know what?
I have had about enough of this.

13:59.305 --> 14:02.832
Why don't you just give it up, man?
You're going to jail anyway.

14:04.643 --> 14:08.409
Hey, hey, hey.
But who am I to be dissing jail, you know?

14:08.581 --> 14:11.106
I hear there's a lot of fascinating criminals
in there.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.883
Look, Jugs... Can I call you Jugs?

14:18.657 --> 14:21.524
You are going about this
all the wrong way, man.

14:21.694 --> 14:25.994
Dude, let me tell you. It is gonna be plenty
of honeys down at that courthouse.

14:26.165 --> 14:29.134
And you know how the ladies
feel about clowns, huh?

14:29.335 --> 14:33.795
Huh? Ha-ha. Oh. You look like you
might've had a little freaky rendezvous...

14:33.973 --> 14:36.874
...with the bearded lady
or something down there, huh? Yeah.

14:39.678 --> 14:42.909
So listen,
if we go up in there holding hands, man...

14:43.082 --> 14:45.380
...we gonna be sending
the wrong message.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.884
So why don't you pop these cuffs off
and throw that bomb out the window?

14:49.054 --> 14:52.490
Let's go to that jail and get our party on,
you know what I'm saying?

14:54.360 --> 14:56.487
You know,
you got a bit of the clown in you.

14:56.662 --> 14:59.426
- Oh, yeah?
- You might even have your own act. Ha-ha.

15:00.099 --> 15:02.033
But I work alone!

15:08.207 --> 15:11.938
Okay. This is it. How do I look?

15:12.111 --> 15:15.842
Oh, my God. Key? Key? Key?
Oh, where is it? Where's...? Oh, here it is.

15:16.015 --> 15:20.076
Oh, my God. Look, my hands are shaking.
I'm never gonna be able to do this.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.619
No, no, no. Hey, no, no. Relax, man.
Listen, you can do it.

15:23.789 --> 15:27.020
Will, if he doesn't think he can do it,
let's not make him.

15:27.192 --> 15:30.889
Oh, he dragged us all the way down here.
He's doing it.

15:31.830 --> 15:34.025
Court is in session.
The Honorable Judge Banks...

15:34.199 --> 15:36.599
Stop, stop, stop. Sit, sit, sit. Sit down.

15:37.136 --> 15:38.831
Come on.

15:39.004 --> 15:42.940
Somebody dim the lights.
It's my damn courtroom, dim the lights.

15:51.884 --> 15:55.115
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages...

15:55.287 --> 15:58.518
...presenting the hardest-working clown
in show business.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.717
I give you Juggles.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.790
Where's the music?

16:16.909 --> 16:19.400
Thank you, Judge Banks.

16:19.878 --> 16:20.936
Ow!

16:22.715 --> 16:25.445
Your Honor, what is going on in here?
This is ridiculous.

16:26.385 --> 16:30.947
That's the general idea. Ha.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.355
Clean him up.

16:39.598 --> 16:40.826
I'm sorry, bro.

16:46.138 --> 16:49.073
<i>It's not exactly clear
what's happening in the courtroom...</i>

16:49.241 --> 16:52.210
<i>... but it appears Judge Banks
has lost control.</i>

16:52.811 --> 16:55.803
This is better than Benny Hill.

16:56.749 --> 17:00.776
<i>This wouldn't be the first time that a judge
has succumbed to the stress of a trial.</i>

17:00.953 --> 17:03.421
<i>We all remember
when Judge Lance Peterson cracked...</i>

17:03.589 --> 17:07.116
<i>... and rendered a verdict with the aide
of a sock puppet named Randy.</i>

17:09.127 --> 17:11.061
Uh, uh, uh.

17:11.230 --> 17:15.257
Ooh.
Gee, Juggles, I could really use a hanky.

17:15.701 --> 17:19.933
Well, my able assistant,
let me see what I have here. Whoa!

17:20.105 --> 17:23.665
Ha-ha-ha. Hey, hey.
You never know when it's gonna end. Oh.

17:23.842 --> 17:25.742
That's the end.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.506
Move on to the next trick.

17:28.680 --> 17:33.379
Oh! And now for the magic pan trick.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.593
Remove the lid.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.264
Um...

17:48.667 --> 17:50.567
We should move on to the next trick.

17:52.204 --> 17:55.571
I said, remove the lid.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.003
Ernie!

18:07.186 --> 18:09.882
They're not laughing.
They're all against me.

18:10.055 --> 18:12.615
Hey, hey, hey, now, wait a minute.
Juggles. Juggles.

18:12.791 --> 18:16.227
Now listen,
these people are not all against you.

18:16.395 --> 18:19.660
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, come here. Come here.

18:19.865 --> 18:21.389
Listen...

18:21.767 --> 18:24.668
...let me say something to you
as a friend.

18:26.505 --> 18:27.529
You suck.

18:29.908 --> 18:31.000
All right?

18:31.443 --> 18:33.502
The reason you can't get work...

18:33.679 --> 18:36.307
It's not because
people don't like you, man...

18:36.482 --> 18:39.713
...you know, it's not because people
don't wanna give you a chance.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.409
It's because you suck.

18:44.423 --> 18:46.118
You know?

18:46.592 --> 18:48.753
You're not funny.

18:50.028 --> 18:52.087
You suck.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.463
Will, are you crazy?

18:54.633 --> 18:57.431
Juggles, he doesn't know what he's saying.
You're very funny.

18:58.937 --> 19:01.371
This crowd is just dead.

19:01.940 --> 19:04.875
Carlton, Ernie is dead.

19:06.378 --> 19:09.347
All right, so you didn't like that one.

19:09.515 --> 19:12.643
Well, maybe you'll like the grand finale.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.252
- Juggles. Wait, wait, Juggles...
He's got a bomb!

19:22.661 --> 19:24.856
Ta-da.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.257
Ta-da?

19:30.335 --> 19:31.825
Wait.

19:32.337 --> 19:35.067
You mean, that's your big finale?

19:40.112 --> 19:42.603
Will was right. You do suck.

19:43.715 --> 19:45.979
Bailiff, get him out of here.
Get him out of here.

19:46.151 --> 19:50.281
Whoa, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I do this thing with dolls.

19:52.891 --> 19:57.157
<i>Sentencing for Tanya Bain, the show-biz
madam was postponed until tomorrow...</i>

19:57.329 --> 19:59.854
<i>... after a dangerously insane man
in a clown costume...</i>

20:00.032 --> 20:02.398
<i>... held the entire proceedings hostage.</i>

20:02.568 --> 20:06.629
Oh, please. That ain't even right.
I mean, he ain't insane.

20:06.805 --> 20:09.831
You know, he's just a clown
that likes to make people laugh...

20:10.008 --> 20:12.738
...and, I don't know,
take some pictures or something...

20:12.911 --> 20:14.208
Will, that's evidence.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.246
Come on. Well, who says it can't be fun
to play with evidence?

20:17.416 --> 20:19.611
Come on, Uncle Phil,
a couple pictures. Smile.

20:23.589 --> 20:26.251
This is evidence.
We shouldn't be playing with this stuff.

20:27.559 --> 20:31.051
- Hey, look, everyone. Look who I found.
- Hey.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.720
Hey, it's the dummy.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.731
Oh, yeah, and he found Safety Guy.

20:37.903 --> 20:41.498
Can you believe no one stole him?
Listen, everyone, we were lucky this time...

20:41.673 --> 20:45.541
...but if we've learned anything from
this crisis, is that in the face of danger...

20:45.711 --> 20:47.906
You scream like a girl?

20:49.348 --> 20:51.612
No. Is that preparation is everything.

20:51.783 --> 20:54.718
Mom, you're the upstairs lookout.
Ashley, man the decoy vehicle.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.684
- Will, secure the perimeter.
- You all want something to eat?

20:57.856 --> 21:00.791
Hilary, upstairs on the roof.
Geoffrey, in the kitchen.

21:00.959 --> 21:04.258
Discipline, people. Discipline.

21:05.831 --> 21:10.791
Well, buddy, looks like the security
of the Banks family rests on our shoulders.
