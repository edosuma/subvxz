00:01.030 --> 00:03.328
(engine revs)
(tires screech)

00:07.070 --> 00:08.628
WOMAN (announcing):
Archer. All new.

00:08.670 --> 00:10.729
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.010 --> 00:15.332
FX presents The Americans.

00:18.910 --> 00:20.673
Previously on
"The Americans"...

00:20.720 --> 00:23.041
MARTHA: I'm in love with you,
and I would do anything for you.

00:23.090 --> 00:26.548
They want reports
and assignments

00:26.590 --> 00:29.320
for a particular
surveillance team.

00:29.360 --> 00:33.524
STAN: You know, I think we
should keep an eye on Martha.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.893
Hi. Clark?

00:36.930 --> 00:38.659
She may not be blown.
PHILIP: No.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.089
If she's blown, the next
operational act she does,

00:41.140 --> 00:43.563
they are putting handcuffs
on her.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.237
Can you come tomorrow night?

00:45.270 --> 00:47.272
I think we should stick
to Tuesday.

00:47.310 --> 00:49.073
(voice breaking) Well,
then you've got to be there.

00:49.110 --> 00:51.169
I-I will. I will.

00:51.210 --> 00:52.609
I love you.

00:52.650 --> 00:55.039
ELIZABETH: We'll do everything
we can for her.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.480
(both breathing heavily)

01:09.060 --> 01:13.793
(inhales, exhales deeply)

01:15.670 --> 01:17.206
What?

01:17.240 --> 01:20.368
One's bigger than the other.

01:20.410 --> 01:22.241
What?

01:22.280 --> 01:25.249
(laughs)

01:25.280 --> 01:26.941
I never noticed that before.

01:38.530 --> 01:39.849
(sighs)

01:42.670 --> 01:43.989
(whispers) Martha's okay.

01:47.270 --> 01:49.807
Nothing's changed.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.262
Nothing has happened.

01:54.980 --> 01:57.744
You think I'm being stupid?

01:57.780 --> 01:59.577
No.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.645
I don't.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.841
Definitely not stupid.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.892
I think you want to do
the right thing.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.122
I brought her into this.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.707
MAN ON TV:
What some Australians want

02:31.750 --> 02:34.014
is for their country
to become a Republic,

02:34.050 --> 02:36.484
farther removed
from the British monarchy.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.886
But Charles wants friends,
with a reference to

02:38.920 --> 02:41.889
his son Prince William,
in Australia for the tour

02:41.920 --> 02:45.026
and a favorite here.
PRINCE CHARLES: But I'm so...

02:45.060 --> 02:47.551
...series, in which we will
meet three women --

02:47.600 --> 02:50.489
one single, one divorced,
one widowed.

02:50.530 --> 02:53.738
All three lead full lives,
which they like very much.

02:53.770 --> 02:56.034
We begin
with Linda Silverstein

02:56.070 --> 02:57.332
of South Miami, Florida.

02:57.370 --> 03:00.168
32 years old, never married.

03:00.210 --> 03:01.871
The nice thing about
where I am now

03:01.910 --> 03:03.207
is I don't feel the need
to be marr--

03:03.250 --> 03:04.547
(switch clicks)

03:05.580 --> 03:09.118
**

04:00.500 --> 04:03.765
Only child, never married,
close to her parents.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.801
She was engaged to
her high-school sweetheart.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.900
A shoe for every foot.

04:08.940 --> 04:10.874
He dumped her.

04:10.910 --> 04:12.673
After she got pregnant.

04:18.790 --> 04:23.124
She had an abortion
in 1964.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.628
Back when it was dangerous.
And illegal.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.599
You find Martha attractive?

04:31.630 --> 04:35.930
(inhales deeply) There's
something sexy about her.

04:35.970 --> 04:38.131
Not much
of a romantic life.

04:40.140 --> 04:41.801
Except for that thing
with Amador.

04:43.610 --> 04:46.170
Who was murdered.

04:46.210 --> 04:48.349
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that, too.

04:52.220 --> 04:54.017
A lonely existence.

04:55.890 --> 04:58.654
A few scattered relationships,
nothing long term.

04:58.690 --> 05:00.157
And then
this new boyfriend.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.761
Her "married" boyfriend.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.324
Who _she can never
bring around.

05:19.350 --> 05:22.046
We need
another glanders sample.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.048
That's not gonna happen.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.854
You've done it once,
you can do it again.

05:26.890 --> 05:29.427
Yeah. I really want to
do that again.

05:32.030 --> 05:35.921
You've been waiting 25 years
for this, William.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.368
It's why you came here,
to make a difference.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.867
And now's your chance.

05:41.900 --> 05:45.666
And when this is over,
you'll return a hero.

05:45.710 --> 05:48.406
(snorts) In a coffin.

05:57.250 --> 06:00.151
(sighs)

06:00.190 --> 06:02.249
Lookit,

06:02.290 --> 06:03.985
there's no way
I can get my hands

06:04.030 --> 06:06.180
on more glanders bacteria.

06:06.230 --> 06:08.050
They're almost finished
their work on it.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.863
_ What else
IS coming In then?

06:12.270 --> 06:13.635
Tularemia.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.235
Easily weaponized.

06:19.910 --> 06:21.730
Nasty stuff.

06:21.780 --> 06:23.771
Sounds good.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.176
(sighs) Yeah.

06:29.220 --> 06:31.211
(indistinct conversations)

06:48.170 --> 06:49.967
(typewriter roller clicks)

06:54.780 --> 06:56.998
PHILIP: I've been running an
agent for a couple of years...

06:58.850 --> 07:01.739
and I think she's in danger.

07:01.780 --> 07:03.816
You "think"?

07:03.850 --> 07:05.579
It's a feeling.

07:05.620 --> 07:08.384
"Feelings."

07:08.420 --> 07:11.150
Little buggers.

07:11.190 --> 07:12.498
So?

07:12.530 --> 07:14.293
So I think we should
get her out.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.636
And they don't want to.

07:22.140 --> 07:25.337
It eats you up...
what we do.

07:29.380 --> 07:32.042
Our bosses don't know
what they're doing.

07:34.650 --> 07:36.811
You figured that out,
right?

07:36.850 --> 07:38.181
She trusts me.

07:40.190 --> 07:41.555
Yeah.

07:43.190 --> 07:45.488
That's always a problem.

07:58.010 --> 08:01.776
**

08:01.810 --> 08:03.869
(sighs)

08:24.200 --> 08:26.020
Martha. Get in.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.701
What's going on, Clark?

08:33.740 --> 08:37.847
I think they may know, Martha,
about you.

08:40.050 --> 08:41.369
How?
I don't know,

08:41.420 --> 08:42.580
but I have to get you
off the street.

08:43.850 --> 08:46.341
Well...where are we going?

08:46.390 --> 08:47.755
I have a place.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.353
Everything's gonna be okay,
Martha, I promise.

09:04.370 --> 09:05.701
Come on in.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.142
(switch clicks)

09:14.980 --> 09:16.618
Does someone live here?

09:16.650 --> 09:19.210
No.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.956
It -- It's okay.

09:29.460 --> 09:30.791
I don't understand
what's happening.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.491
I know.
Clark, I'm scared.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.601
What am I doing here?
Martha, it's gonna be
all right.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.198
I promise you,
everything --

09:39.240 --> 09:42.129
everything is gonna be
all right. I promise.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.889
(door opens)

09:49.920 --> 09:51.239
(door closes)

09:52.590 --> 09:55.252
This is Gabriel. I called him.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.587
He's a good friend.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.121
It's a great pleasure
to meet you, Martha.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.924
Clark has told me
so much about you.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.723
I, um...

10:03.770 --> 10:06.739
I have to talk with him now,
so...

10:06.770 --> 10:08.397
Maybe you could go
into the kitchen

10:08.440 --> 10:11.102
and, uh, make some tea
for yourself?

10:11.140 --> 10:13.700
I'll be in in a few minutes.
I promise.

10:16.140 --> 10:17.471
I promise.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.292
Gabriel.

10:39.330 --> 10:40.934
I don't know what you were --
I didn't have a choice.

10:40.970 --> 10:42.528
She needs to get out now.

10:42.570 --> 10:44.504
You're acting impulsively,
Philip.

10:47.310 --> 10:50.700
I've been handling Martha
for three years.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.446
Three years.
She marri me.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.845
I'm not talking about Martha.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.472
I'm talking about you.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.408
You promised me
this would never happen.

10:59.720 --> 11:03.053
I know the things that we do
are complicated,

11:03.090 --> 11:05.524
but we can fix this.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.324
Have Martha return to work
tomorrow.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.691
This never happened.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.538
That's your plan?
Yes.

11:13.570 --> 11:15.333
We can go back
to the way we were.

11:30.550 --> 11:32.347
Gabriel, Martha's seen me.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.226
(sighs)

11:38.260 --> 11:39.579
How?

11:41.130 --> 11:43.166
It happened.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.065
What we had wasn't working.

11:45.100 --> 11:48.558
So you just decided,
on your own,

11:48.600 --> 11:51.205
that you were going to show her
what you really look like?

11:51.240 --> 11:54.676
If the FBI gets to her,

11:54.710 --> 11:57.178
if they break --
What you did

11:57.210 --> 11:58.871
was flat-out wrong.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.969
You don't know
because I was there.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.757
How long has she known?

12:08.790 --> 12:10.257
You'd have to ask her.

12:10.290 --> 12:11.848
You've risked lives.

12:11.890 --> 12:14.222
When were you going
to tell me?

12:14.260 --> 12:17.093
Or were you
going to tell me?

12:17.130 --> 12:19.860
Losing Martha now
when we need her intelligence

12:19.900 --> 12:22.801
to meet with William...
I don't give a Goddamn --

12:22.840 --> 12:24.432
Will you listen to me?

12:24.470 --> 12:27.837
Stop handling me, Gabriel,
because Martha is done.

12:30.110 --> 12:32.578
(teakettle whistling)

12:47.130 --> 12:50.293
(laughter on TV)

12:50.330 --> 12:52.935
(telephone rings)

12:54.940 --> 12:56.908
MAN ON TV: Hello?

12:56.940 --> 12:59.306
No, sorry,
Gracie's not home right now.

13:03.650 --> 13:06.642
(TV continues indistinctly)

13:16.890 --> 13:18.983
(faucet turns on)

13:25.230 --> 13:27.266
(door opens)

13:27.300 --> 13:29.268
ELIZABETH: Hello?

13:29.300 --> 13:30.858
PHILIP: We're in here.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.673
I'll be in in just a sec.

13:40.380 --> 13:42.610
I brought you some things.

13:42.650 --> 13:45.517
Some clothes, toothbrush.

13:47.190 --> 13:50.182
MAN: No_w wait_a_minute.
(speaking Indlstlnctly)

13:50.690 --> 13:52.749
You're part of all this?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.319
It's going to be all right.

14:00.670 --> 14:02.490
I'm here for you.

14:02.540 --> 14:03.859
We all are.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.405
(laughter on TV)

14:10.450 --> 14:12.805
Something smells good.

14:12.850 --> 14:15.842
Gabriel
is a fabulous cook.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.541
Why don't I go check on
the boys?

14:19.960 --> 14:21.712
Let me refresh your glass.

14:21.760 --> 14:26.049
(TV continues indistinctly)

14:26.530 --> 14:29.328
GIRL: ...all asked me.
I couldn't say no to them all.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.363
(laughter)

14:43.480 --> 14:45.778
She'd already seen me.

14:45.810 --> 14:47.812
VVhen?

14:50.320 --> 14:51.878
About three weeks ago.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.724
She was falling apart.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.625
I had to.

15:11.140 --> 15:12.505
Did you want her to?

15:15.110 --> 15:16.429
To see you.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.386
I-I didn't know
what else to do.

15:23.420 --> 15:24.739
She needed...

15:27.260 --> 15:28.488
I don't know.

15:57.350 --> 15:59.147
You should've told me
you were brIngIng her In.

16:04.190 --> 16:06.522
I-I couldn't just let her...

16:06.560 --> 16:07.857
(wine pours)

16:19.710 --> 16:23.146
It's my shift, so you should
probably get back home.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.685
Um...

16:30.720 --> 16:33.848
I-I think it's better
if I stay the night.

16:46.830 --> 16:49.230
I'll, um, bring that in
to Martha.

17:03.850 --> 17:05.215
Tell her
I'll see her tomorrow.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.849
(door opens)

17:14.900 --> 17:18.063
I'm making sundubu jjigae.
It's Korean.

17:18.100 --> 17:21.069
My friend gave me this pot,

17:21.100 --> 17:23.409
and so I'm following her
instructions.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.861
Who is she?

17:26.910 --> 17:29.333
Someone I met through work.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.439
And she cooks Korean food?

17:32.750 --> 17:34.115
She's Korean.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.081
You wanna be my Guinea pig?

17:42.120 --> 17:43.883
Sure.

17:45.590 --> 17:46.921
Be brave. Come on.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.697
Too much pepper?

17:52.730 --> 17:54.869
Um, the chicken is
a little...

17:54.900 --> 17:56.788
Rubbery?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.808
It's tofu.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.705
Yeah, it's made
from soy milk,

18:00.740 --> 18:02.776
an excellent source
of "rubbery" protein,

18:02.810 --> 18:05.404
or so I'm told.

18:05.450 --> 18:06.747
Henry?

18:06.780 --> 18:08.975
In a sec.
(video game beeping)

18:09.020 --> 18:11.386
Will you please
set the table?

18:11.420 --> 18:14.412
(utensils clattering)

18:15.790 --> 18:17.781
Will you show me how
to write my papers on that?

18:17.830 --> 18:19.457
Yeah, sure.

18:19.490 --> 18:21.299
You can't print it
'cause we don't have a printer.

18:21.330 --> 18:22.649
You can use
the one at work.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.258
We're not giving up
on Epcot, are we?

18:24.300 --> 18:26.268
(sighs heavily)

18:26.300 --> 18:27.665
We'll get there.

18:32.540 --> 18:33.939
HENRY: Smells good.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.130
We're having sundubu jjigae
tonight.

18:36.180 --> 18:37.579
Sounds like baby talk.

18:37.610 --> 18:39.805
(Elizabeth laughs)
It's Korean.

18:39.850 --> 18:41.772
Oh. Cool.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.084
Epcot.
Don't kill the dream.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.281
(Elizabeth laughs)

18:46.320 --> 18:49.812
Finish what you're doing
and please sit at the table.

18:49.860 --> 18:51.885
Wait. Where's dad?

18:53.830 --> 18:55.149
He's working.

19:16.220 --> 19:19.018
There's only one change
of clothes in here, Clark.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.355
It won't be long, Martha.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.191
What will happen?

19:30.370 --> 19:31.689
Where will we go?

19:36.370 --> 19:37.769
You have to trust me.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.008
Jennifer's not your sister.

19:49.180 --> 19:50.511
(sighs)

19:53.090 --> 19:54.409
No.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.759
You work together.

20:06.570 --> 20:07.889
Yes.

20:11.570 --> 20:13.299
Are you involved
with her?

20:17.910 --> 20:20.105
We've worked together
for a long time.

20:26.620 --> 20:27.951
For who?

20:37.730 --> 20:39.129
(sighs heavily)

20:39.170 --> 20:41.559
For the KGB.

21:01.790 --> 21:05.157
(gasps) I...

21:05.190 --> 21:06.555
I...

21:06.590 --> 21:09.650
Martha.
(sniffles)

21:09.700 --> 21:11.019
Martha...

21:15.200 --> 21:18.306
You don't have to do
anything,

21:18.340 --> 21:19.967
not ever again.

21:21.640 --> 21:24.746
All you have to do --
Just breathe.

21:24.780 --> 21:26.099
Breathe.
(sniffles)

21:31.790 --> 21:33.451
Okay?
Okay.

21:33.490 --> 21:35.310
Everything is gonna be okay.

21:36.290 --> 21:38.349
You said you need to know
everything.

21:43.370 --> 21:46.589
I never thought
that I would...

21:46.630 --> 21:48.166
know whalifit was like --

21:50.840 --> 21:52.239
If there was another way...

21:56.380 --> 21:57.779
I don't care.

21:57.810 --> 22:01.439
Doesn't matter,
not anymore.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.038
As long as we're together.

22:26.670 --> 22:29.707
(cries) We can run away.

22:29.740 --> 22:33.198
We can run far away
somewhere.

22:33.250 --> 22:36.174
There are places
where no one can find us.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.551
I need you inside me.

22:46.590 --> 22:48.558
Come inside me.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.592
(breathing heavily)

22:56.640 --> 22:58.039
(unzips pants)

23:10.890 --> 23:12.539
(gasps and sniffles)

23:14.290 --> 23:17.282
(gasping)

23:54.430 --> 23:55.988
Morning, Stan.

23:56.030 --> 23:58.089
Where's Martha?
She called in sick.

24:00.370 --> 24:01.894
Martha's sick.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.601
So I hear.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.835
Let's say we give her a call,
make sure she's okay.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.549
(telephone rings)

24:27.390 --> 24:29.893
(ﬁng)

24:31.800 --> 24:34.530
(ring, beep)
Hello, this is Martha.

24:34.570 --> 24:36.299
I can't come to the phone
right now.

24:36.340 --> 24:37.602
Please leave a message
at the sound of the beep.

24:37.640 --> 24:39.460
Answering machine.
(beep)

24:51.490 --> 24:52.980
What happens next?

24:53.020 --> 24:55.511
We'll, um --
We'll find a good place.

24:57.490 --> 24:58.923
Won't be easy, but...

25:02.730 --> 25:04.288
The person
who was watching me,

25:04.330 --> 25:06.992
he just thinks that I was
being followed?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.536
He's very good.

25:11.570 --> 25:13.367
Oh, I know.

25:13.410 --> 25:15.332
But, um, if he was mistaken...

25:17.410 --> 25:19.549
if he's wrong...
Martha...

25:19.580 --> 25:21.719
...then we could go back
to the way things were.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.239
We could.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.251
Couldn't we?

25:34.460 --> 25:36.223
I wish we could.

25:49.580 --> 25:51.207
I'm never going home,
am I?

26:28.180 --> 26:31.183
(drawers opening and closing)

26:50.810 --> 26:52.129
(door closes)

27:21.140 --> 27:23.597
Where is she?

27:23.640 --> 27:25.130
She's resting.

27:25.170 --> 27:27.604
I just had an emergency signal
from William.

27:27.640 --> 27:30.302
Not a good time for me
to leave, Gabriel.

27:30.340 --> 27:34.219
I wouldn't send you out there
to see just anyone.

27:34.250 --> 27:37.071
But you know what he has
access to right now.

27:39.390 --> 27:41.255
There's always some reason.

27:43.690 --> 27:45.021
Oh, Philip.

27:55.670 --> 27:58.059
There's not just some reason.

27:59.770 --> 28:03.069
If they target
our nuclear capacity

28:03.110 --> 28:04.407
in a first strike,

28:04.450 --> 28:06.179
our people back home
will have nothing

28:06.210 --> 28:10.010
to defend themselves with
but these weapons.

28:10.050 --> 28:13.645
I've been there when we couldn't
defend ourselves.

28:13.690 --> 28:15.009
You know what happened.

28:17.020 --> 28:20.353
We can't trust Martha's
surveillance reports anymore.

28:20.390 --> 28:22.096
She called in sick.

28:22.130 --> 28:24.098
They could already
be suspicious.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.242
I'll let her know
I'll be gone for a while.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.053
Thank you.

28:53.630 --> 28:54.892
Be careful.

29:06.670 --> 29:08.001
(door closes)

29:09.240 --> 29:10.571
Martha?

29:15.350 --> 29:16.669
(whispers) Martha.

29:37.700 --> 29:39.031
(pills rattle)

30:16.540 --> 30:17.871
(cylinder clicks)

30:56.920 --> 31:00.014
And does this look like
Mr. Westerfeld?

31:06.090 --> 31:07.421
MAN: Not really.

31:10.430 --> 31:11.692
Did he sign a lease?

31:11.730 --> 31:14.290
(scoffs)
This isn't a flophouse.

31:16.270 --> 31:18.830
ADERHOLT: There's
no answering machine tape.

31:18.870 --> 31:20.735
No photos.

31:20.770 --> 31:23.273
No mementos.

31:23.310 --> 31:24.641
Nothing personal.

31:26.810 --> 31:28.368
We should get forensics
in here.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.083
Let's have a look
at that lease.

32:14.830 --> 32:16.457
(door opens)

33:05.380 --> 33:07.644
I just talked to forensics,
they got some prints.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.545
They know it's a rush?
Yeah.

33:09.580 --> 33:11.138
The name check
on Clark Westerfeld

33:11.190 --> 33:13.112
turned up
an 85-year-old gun salesman

33:13.150 --> 33:16.278
living in a retirement community
in Haley, Idaho,

33:16.320 --> 33:18.629
and a 35-year-old attorney
in Atlanta.

33:18.660 --> 33:20.287
Less than a 2-hour flight.

33:20.330 --> 33:22.457
He could fly up
a couple of nights a week.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.956
Yeah, have the Atlanta
field office

33:24.000 --> 33:25.297
check out the lavwer.

33:25.330 --> 33:27.321
This guy --
he married with kids?

33:27.370 --> 33:29.930
All we have right now
are names and dates of birth.

33:31.610 --> 33:32.907
Send a teletype
to all field offices

33:32.940 --> 33:34.407
around the country.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.032
Have 'em check courthouses
for death certificates

33:36.080 --> 33:38.776
for any other Clark Westerfelds.
Will do.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.760
Martha said her boyfriend's
a businessman, right?

34:00.800 --> 34:02.995
Yeah.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.031
Are lawyers businessmen?

34:17.980 --> 34:20.619
(men speaking indistinctly)

34:28.560 --> 34:29.891
We need to talk.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.514
I think Martha's bad.

34:51.850 --> 34:54.455
Martha.

34:54.490 --> 34:57.084
I know.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.281
She called in sick today.

34:59.330 --> 35:01.821
We went to her place.
She's not there.

35:03.330 --> 35:04.627
All right.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.165
What do you have?

35:09.200 --> 35:12.567
Well, Martha told me
she's seeing someone --

35:12.610 --> 35:14.931
a businessman,
couple of nights a week.

35:14.980 --> 35:19.098
He's married with kids,
so she had to keep it secret.

35:19.150 --> 35:23.769
We went to the apartment
where they meet.

35:23.820 --> 35:26.015
Answering machine tape
is gone.

35:26.050 --> 35:28.257
No photos.

35:28.290 --> 35:29.757
Prints?

35:29.790 --> 35:31.109
Forensics is on it.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.321
You got a name?

35:33.360 --> 35:35.658
Clark Westerfeld.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.656
Two guys turned up.

35:37.700 --> 35:40.794
One in Atlanta
could be a maybe.

35:40.830 --> 35:42.491
Death certificates?

35:42.540 --> 35:43.893
We're working on it.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.700
Martha's worked here
over 10 years.

35:57.380 --> 35:58.711
That's...

36:01.520 --> 36:03.715
That's crazy.

36:09.860 --> 36:13.068
**

37:28.980 --> 37:30.299
BROOKS: Okay.

37:32.350 --> 37:33.749
Thank you.

37:36.580 --> 37:37.672
Nothing yet.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.360
Do you have it?

38:00.640 --> 38:02.301
I had to improvise.

38:05.980 --> 38:08.517
I couldn't get to
a tularemia culture,

38:08.550 --> 38:10.745
but I was able to recover
one of the dead rats

38:10.780 --> 38:12.316
they tested it on.

38:12.350 --> 38:14.887
They can get a sample
from its tissue.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.828
Hey, what'd you do?

38:21.860 --> 38:23.396
With your agent?

38:26.370 --> 38:28.065
I'm bringing her in.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.604
Good for you.

38:32.640 --> 38:37.179
When Eliza, my wife,
was sent back...

38:37.210 --> 38:38.541
I stayed quiet.

38:41.150 --> 38:44.381
I didn't think I could
take them on.

38:44.420 --> 38:47.082
I wanted to,
but I didn't.

39:09.010 --> 39:10.875
(engine starts)

39:36.300 --> 39:39.030
(exhales)

39:39.070 --> 39:41.777
(caps bottle)

39:41.810 --> 39:43.835
Well, hello.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.199
You slept well, I hope.

39:47.710 --> 39:49.439
Where's Clark?

39:49.480 --> 39:51.880
Well, he didn't want
to leave you,

39:51.920 --> 39:53.945
but something unexpected
came up that couldn't wait.

39:53.990 --> 39:55.787
He'll be back shortly.

39:55.820 --> 39:58.254
It's a lovely day.

39:58.290 --> 40:00.349
Can I make you
something to eat?

40:00.390 --> 40:01.721
An omelet?

40:19.410 --> 40:20.968
(knock on door, door opens)

40:25.990 --> 40:27.309
(door closes)

40:30.290 --> 40:33.555
Martha was here
when I took over the division.

40:33.590 --> 40:35.296
I could've requested
someone else.

40:35.330 --> 40:38.595
My old secretary, Janine,
asked if she could come back.

40:38.630 --> 40:40.427
Hmm.

40:40.470 --> 40:43.291
But I felt bad about kicking
Martha off the desk.

40:47.540 --> 40:49.201
No good deed...

40:56.950 --> 40:59.487
Maybe I got it wrong.

40:59.520 --> 41:02.080
Maybe she took a sick day,

41:02.120 --> 41:06.124
and she's off with a perfectly
legitimate Clark Westerfeld

41:06.160 --> 41:09.095
in some hotel somewhere.

41:09.130 --> 41:10.449
You believe that?

41:19.740 --> 41:23.198
Nobody could've put that pen
there more easily than Martha.

41:24.910 --> 41:27.549
How could I not see it?

41:27.580 --> 41:30.048
We trust each other.

41:31.550 --> 41:35.179
She could've been
working with Gene.

41:35.220 --> 41:38.883
Or...they could've killed him
to protect her.

41:45.330 --> 41:48.424
She had access
to everything.

42:04.350 --> 42:05.578
(sighs)

42:21.640 --> 42:22.959
Martha?

42:24.810 --> 42:26.107
(door opens)

42:31.240 --> 42:33.071
Martha, come back
to the house now.

42:35.050 --> 42:37.177
Martha, listen to me.

42:37.220 --> 42:39.518
Where's Clark?
He had to step out.

42:39.550 --> 42:40.949
Where is he?

42:40.990 --> 42:44.414
Let's talk about this
lnSIde, please.

42:44.460 --> 42:45.757
What have you done to him?

42:45.790 --> 42:47.428
Nothing.

42:47.460 --> 42:50.349
Clark is all right.
He will be here very soon.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.288
I don't believe you.

42:52.330 --> 42:54.764
What is happening to me?!

42:54.800 --> 42:57.928
Martha, will you please
come back to the house?

42:57.970 --> 43:00.939
We are all working very hard
to get you to a safe place.

43:00.970 --> 43:03.234
Why would he leave me here
with you?

43:06.150 --> 43:07.742
Because you can trust me.

43:07.780 --> 43:09.441
Trust you.

43:09.480 --> 43:10.913
I don't know you.

43:10.950 --> 43:13.646
No. No!

43:13.690 --> 43:16.318
Get away from me.
I know what you are.

43:16.360 --> 43:17.782
Martha...

43:17.820 --> 43:19.924
No, you stay away from me.

43:19.960 --> 43:22.497
I'll scream,

43:22.530 --> 43:25.499
and everybo will know
that you're KGB.

44:24.260 --> 44:26.251
(woman whispering)

44:45.110 --> 44:47.578
-(silenced gunshot)
-(silenced gunshots)

44:47.610 --> 44:49.111
(door opens)

44:58.730 --> 45:00.254
ANNOUNCER:

45:00.290 --> 45:03.088
All new,

45:04.900 --> 45:06.993
-Thursdays.
-Why the hell are you naked?

45:07.030 --> 45:10.090
It's after Labor Day!

45:10.140 --> 45:14.429
WOMAN (announcing):

Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

45:15.910 --> 45:17.332
(crowd cheering)

45:17.380 --> 45:18.904
MAN:
* Yeah

45:18.950 --> 45:23.319
* Sex and drugs
and rock and roll, all right *

45:24.220 --> 45:25.619
* All right
