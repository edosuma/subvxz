WEBVTT

00:00.046 --> 00:01.787
Previously on 'The Last Ship'.

00:02.607 --> 00:05.674
You all have saved the
world three times now,

00:05.720 --> 00:07.380
how on earth do you do it?

00:07.405 --> 00:09.718
I can't promise the
fight won't be hard.

00:09.769 --> 00:11.796
But I can say we will prevail.

00:11.821 --> 00:15.087
- Gustavo's Chief War Strategist.
- Find out what he knows.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.187
You know his next moves.
Help me stop him.

00:19.215 --> 00:21.542
If I help you, will it save my nation?

00:21.567 --> 00:24.158
If you don't, will your
nation still be worth saving?

00:24.717 --> 00:26.757
Dr. Montano just gave us the key.

00:26.782 --> 00:29.863
- We take Cuba,
- we can win this war.

Simon.

02:53.934 --> 02:55.650
The C-130 Liberty One

02:55.681 --> 02:59.367
will depart Naval Air Station
Key West at 2200 hours.

02:59.467 --> 03:01.826
Lima team, partnered Navy/Marine Corps,

03:01.851 --> 03:05.959
will air-drop 13 miles off the
Cuban coast, landing at Guines,

03:05.984 --> 03:07.589
which, according to intel

03:07.614 --> 03:10.081
Admiral Chandler obtained
from Dr. Montano...

03:10.187 --> 03:12.057
is the home
to a hidden rebel stronghold.

03:12.217 --> 03:14.287
What kind of numbers can we expect?

03:14.384 --> 03:19.346
The rebel force is somewhere
between 500 and 5,000.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.441
Our team's
dropping in with a 2-ton gift

03:22.466 --> 03:24.466
of small arms and light weapons.

03:24.627 --> 03:26.150
Whatever their size, I promise you,

03:26.175 --> 03:28.183
that militia will be well-outfitted.

03:28.410 --> 03:30.210
Now, once Lima team makes contact

03:30.235 --> 03:31.693
with El Gallo and his men...

03:31.718 --> 03:33.135
I'm sorry, Admiral.

03:33.160 --> 03:36.094
How confident are you in this El Gallo?

03:36.307 --> 03:39.082
This unknown leader of Free Cuba?

03:40.023 --> 03:42.049
You think he's more inclined
to join our cause

03:42.074 --> 03:46.144
than, say, the Chinese or the
Indians or the Brits right now?

03:46.247 --> 03:48.312
How confident are you
that when our team lands,

03:48.337 --> 03:50.262
they find themselves met
by friendly interests

03:50.287 --> 03:53.887
and not, say, indifference
or hostility... 1 to 10?

03:54.323 --> 03:55.750
- One being...
- Well...

03:55.775 --> 03:59.054
they slit our throats soon
as we hit the beach.

04:08.193 --> 04:10.687
Six, sir.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.660
General, you signed off on this?

04:14.747 --> 04:16.147
I did, sir.

04:16.247 --> 04:18.540
Though, to be frank, I have concerns.

04:18.620 --> 04:21.551
General's worried the intel
I got from Dr. Montano

04:21.576 --> 04:22.776
may not be trustworthy.

04:22.804 --> 04:26.381
I've lost a lot of Marines
already, Mr. President.

04:26.887 --> 04:29.148
Trust in anything
coming out of Gustavo's camp

04:29.173 --> 04:31.001
is in short supply.

04:32.027 --> 04:33.584
But you trust it, Admiral.

04:33.670 --> 04:35.340
I was with the man.

04:35.568 --> 04:37.105
He lost faith in Gustavo

04:37.130 --> 04:39.105
and gave his life
to stop the bloodshed.

04:42.012 --> 04:44.044
I've had the country
running at full tilt

04:44.069 --> 04:45.265
for the last three months

04:45.290 --> 04:47.560
to put us in a position
to take back Mexico,

04:47.597 --> 04:49.250
and now...

04:49.437 --> 04:51.761
you wanna air-drop a
dozen of our finest

04:51.786 --> 04:54.605
into the lion's den
before we can back 'em up?

04:54.731 --> 04:56.131
Gustavo's preoccupied

04:56.156 --> 04:58.286
with shoring up support from his base.

04:58.587 --> 05:02.315
Now is the best time for us
to make our move on Cuba.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.103
And we need it, sir...

05:04.128 --> 05:06.258
not just as a buffer
against another major attack,

05:06.287 --> 05:09.227
but as a staging area to launch
our own invasion south.

05:17.937 --> 05:19.584
Please continue, Admiral.

05:19.674 --> 05:21.213
Thank you, sir.

05:53.247 --> 05:54.533
Señor Barros.

05:54.586 --> 05:56.140
Gustavo.

05:56.777 --> 06:00.047
Tell me, what's a win?

06:00.746 --> 06:02.657
Jumping to the end already?

06:02.739 --> 06:04.832
Doesn't feel like a jump to me.

06:04.969 --> 06:07.269
In your speeches, you promised
your people a quick victory.

06:07.294 --> 06:08.462
But, from what I've seen,

06:08.487 --> 06:10.957
you've been stuck in place
for some time now.

06:11.107 --> 06:13.211
I'm curious
if your thinking has changed

06:13.236 --> 06:15.976
or if you regret starting
a war with the United States.

06:16.064 --> 06:17.795
We didn't start this war.

06:17.874 --> 06:19.554
You sank a U.S. fleet in Mayport

06:19.584 --> 06:20.934
on the very day that your loyalists

06:20.959 --> 06:23.089
murdered the duly-elected
leader of Panama.

06:23.537 --> 06:24.926
That sounds textbook.

06:25.007 --> 06:28.147
Mayport wasn't an attack,
nor was it the beginning.

06:28.812 --> 06:32.715
You're young, but smart enough
to know the U.S.'s history

06:32.740 --> 06:35.534
of murder and political
insurrection in Latin America.

06:35.977 --> 06:38.786
Guatemala '54, Cuba '61,

06:38.811 --> 06:41.471
D.R. '65, Chile '73,

06:41.496 --> 06:44.026
Nicaragua '82, Grenada '83.

06:44.227 --> 06:46.697
This war is a battle for the survival

06:46.746 --> 06:48.886
of the people of Gran Colombia.

06:49.643 --> 06:53.351
So, is this your justification
for the forced conscription,

06:53.376 --> 06:55.028
the purges, the death squads?

06:55.077 --> 06:57.312
<i>Where do you get this information from?</i>

06:57.336 --> 06:58.811
<i>Several accounts from defectors...</i>

06:58.836 --> 07:00.504
<i>Defectors from what?</i>

07:00.937 --> 07:02.764
Our borders are not closed.

07:02.917 --> 07:04.959
People are free
to come and go as they wish.

07:05.061 --> 07:07.005
Their accounts
are remarkably consistent.

07:07.030 --> 07:10.331
This isn't a war of public opinion.

07:10.453 --> 07:13.776
This is about taking
a fresh look at the world...

07:15.001 --> 07:17.644
post-virus, post-famine.

07:17.794 --> 07:21.794
It's about adjusting the balance.

07:22.419 --> 07:25.846
United States have been
bullies for too long.

07:28.477 --> 07:30.537
This movement is a rebirth.

07:30.905 --> 07:32.495
Take your camera and your notepad

07:32.520 --> 07:33.790
and go to the countryside.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.578
Go to the cities
of Central and South America

07:37.603 --> 07:40.203
and see the pride in people's faces.

07:40.901 --> 07:43.408
Freedom from tyranny
is what they demanded.

07:43.557 --> 07:45.611
And it's what I'm giving them.

07:45.827 --> 07:49.627
And I'm inviting the people
of all of the Americas to join.

08:06.856 --> 08:08.533
Ensign Swain. Any news?

08:08.580 --> 08:10.705
- No, sir.
- No surprise there.

08:10.730 --> 08:12.052
She's probably hiding
in a hole somewhere,

08:12.076 --> 08:13.245
hoping we give up looking.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.520
No chance of that, sir.

08:14.743 --> 08:16.873
I've been monitoring
cell activity for Colombia

08:16.898 --> 08:18.828
and the United States for months.

08:18.927 --> 08:21.291
If Kelsi's still in contact
with anyone down south,

08:21.316 --> 08:23.246
- we'll know it.
- Well, good.

08:23.271 --> 08:24.811
Till then, I have another job for you.

08:25.143 --> 08:27.344
- Sir, I...
- Radio jammers aboard the <i> James</i>

08:27.369 --> 08:28.639
were fried in the attack.

08:28.664 --> 08:30.664
I need you to reprogram
her electric grid.

08:30.867 --> 08:32.652
I want to make sure those
Cuban artillery batteries

08:32.677 --> 08:35.029
don't use our Herc as target practice.

08:35.996 --> 08:37.527
Where do you need me?

08:41.357 --> 08:43.397
$1.25.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.040
Um...

08:50.067 --> 08:52.327
I only got $1.15.

08:54.099 --> 08:55.427
Are you kidding?

08:55.481 --> 08:56.651
No. Beat it.

08:58.427 --> 09:00.140
Hey! Stop!

09:00.773 --> 09:02.273
Get back here!

09:08.881 --> 09:11.409
Zoey? It's getting late, sweetie.

09:11.434 --> 09:13.404
Time to come in.

09:15.115 --> 09:17.663
But, Mom! Aunt Kelsi's here.

09:17.688 --> 09:19.013
Just a few more pushes?

09:19.138 --> 09:21.491
Yeah, Mom.

09:21.577 --> 09:23.670
Just a few more?

09:28.233 --> 09:31.225
Yeah, I heard rumors
that you were in Carta-geena?

09:31.272 --> 09:33.542
Mm, Cartagena.

09:34.114 --> 09:35.244
Yeah, right.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.808
You didn't leave the country?

09:37.971 --> 09:39.371
You just disappeared.

09:39.688 --> 09:41.618
If you wanna ask, ask.

09:42.089 --> 09:43.968
Just stop, please.

09:44.449 --> 09:46.119
Oh, go ahead. Ask me.

09:46.144 --> 09:47.684
I don't need to ask.

09:48.108 --> 09:49.492
'Cause you know
everything about me, right?

09:49.516 --> 09:51.145
I know what kind of person you are.

09:51.195 --> 09:53.371
- Oh, what kind of a pers...
- The kind who runs off

09:53.396 --> 09:55.507
with any loser promising adventure.

09:55.532 --> 09:56.656
The kind who makes a mess

09:56.681 --> 09:58.481
and leaves the rest of us
to clean it up.

09:58.758 --> 10:00.191
The kind who hasn't even bothered

10:00.216 --> 10:01.897
to come see her own daughter.

10:02.761 --> 10:04.161
Mom?

10:04.254 --> 10:06.724
Can you read me
"The Paper Bag Princess"?

10:06.858 --> 10:08.858
Uh... did you brush your teeth?

10:09.485 --> 10:11.825
Okay, I'll be in in a sec.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.528
Night, Aunt Kelsi.

10:16.591 --> 10:18.251
Night.

10:18.338 --> 10:19.465
Sleep tight.

10:19.490 --> 10:21.890
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

10:26.723 --> 10:28.463
Remember when you used to
read that to me?

10:29.120 --> 10:30.880
You need to turn yourself in.

10:31.111 --> 10:32.641
I know.

10:32.862 --> 10:35.132
No, you don't know.

10:35.820 --> 10:37.229
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

10:37.254 --> 10:39.383
Putting me in danger.
Putting Zoey in danger.

10:39.408 --> 10:41.208
No one's in danger.
It's not like I'm...

10:41.233 --> 10:42.350
A what?

10:42.442 --> 10:44.025
A murderer?

10:44.201 --> 10:46.001
A terrorist?

10:46.154 --> 10:48.967
Go ahead. Tell me you're not.

10:49.538 --> 10:52.093
Look me in the eye
and tell me the cops,

10:52.175 --> 10:54.168
the Navy, and the goddamn FBI

10:54.220 --> 10:55.890
tore my house apart for three weeks

10:55.915 --> 10:58.115
because you didn't kill that woman.

11:00.677 --> 11:03.290
I don't know where else to go.

11:07.248 --> 11:09.518
Police station would be a start.

11:10.723 --> 11:12.530
And say what?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.571
- The truth.
- The truth?

11:14.758 --> 11:16.853
What's the truth, Elli?

11:17.311 --> 11:19.051
That I'm an idiot?

11:19.398 --> 11:22.643
That I thought I was helping?

11:23.027 --> 11:27.903
That it turns out I am just
a piece of Florida white trash

11:27.928 --> 11:30.643
thinking I could solve
the world's problems?

11:31.618 --> 11:33.381
I know what I did.

11:34.835 --> 11:37.171
And I know what's coming for me.

11:37.388 --> 11:39.188
God knows I deserve it.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.395
You're not trash,

11:50.458 --> 11:52.988
and you're not a monster.

11:53.516 --> 11:55.709
And, I mean, at this point,
according to the U.S. government,

11:55.734 --> 11:56.905
you're basically the most

11:56.930 --> 11:58.410
important human being
on the planet, right?

12:00.014 --> 12:01.769
Just tell them something.

12:02.588 --> 12:05.118
Cut a deal. It won't be so bad.

12:07.190 --> 12:08.648
Yeah.

12:10.431 --> 12:12.496
We're gonna get you a good deal.

12:13.841 --> 12:15.841
And we're gonna make it through this.

12:16.188 --> 12:17.975
You, me, and Zoey.

12:31.031 --> 12:33.874
On course, 2-1-0, making 16 knots.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.893
Estimated time of arrival
based on current speed...

12:36.994 --> 12:38.999
3 hours and 45 minutes.

12:39.538 --> 12:40.933
Anything pop up in the shakedown?

12:40.958 --> 12:42.398
Well, some trouble out of two gen,

12:42.423 --> 12:44.079
but we'll have it online in the hour.

12:44.104 --> 12:47.243
And we haven't sprung any leaks,
so that's a good thing.

12:47.418 --> 12:48.726
Roger that.

12:48.828 --> 12:50.838
CIC, Bridge. Report your status.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.347
Sub-surface clear. All systems go.

12:53.801 --> 12:56.207
Surface clear. All systems go.

12:56.271 --> 12:58.470
Bridge, T.A.O. Testing is complete.

12:58.604 --> 13:01.135
All combat systems
are up and ready to go.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.968
- It's good to be back, ma'am.
- Glad to hear it.

13:03.993 --> 13:06.247
After three months of dry dock,
I think we set a record.

13:06.348 --> 13:08.048
Captain, Radio. All circuits up.

13:08.073 --> 13:10.135
HF Channel is encrypted and secure.

13:10.271 --> 13:11.541
Who else do we have on the line?

13:11.566 --> 13:13.565
Patching through Command now.

13:14.262 --> 13:16.764
<i>Nathan James,</i>
we hear you loud and clear.

13:17.277 --> 13:19.299
Much as I enjoyed Moby Dick,

13:19.448 --> 13:21.117
it's a pleasure to hear your voice.

13:21.332 --> 13:23.569
Admiral Chandler, how's the Herc?

13:23.854 --> 13:27.016
Weapons supply is currently
being loaded and on schedule.

13:27.041 --> 13:28.771
Hitting Cuban airspace in 3 hours.

13:28.796 --> 13:30.465
Sound about right, Captain Green?

13:30.631 --> 13:33.810
We'll be waiting.
Have a safe flight, Admiral.

13:34.601 --> 13:36.036
Go ahead.

13:42.601 --> 13:44.085
Watch it, Marine.

13:44.325 --> 13:47.007
Sorry, Chief. My bad.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.407
Excuse the fellas, Admiral.

13:49.528 --> 13:51.747
The Marines have been grounded
since the Mayport attack.

13:51.813 --> 13:53.648
They're angry
and ready to hook and jab.

13:53.742 --> 13:55.201
They'll get their chance.

13:55.388 --> 13:57.727
Thank you, sir,
for everything you've done.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.320
All loaded up.

14:01.428 --> 14:03.259
When's the last time you jumped?

14:03.458 --> 14:05.057
On purpose? I don't know.

14:05.082 --> 14:07.760
- Six or seven years.
- Like falling off a bike.

14:08.368 --> 14:09.949
Sure you don't want
to join in the fun, Professor?

14:09.973 --> 14:13.372
Someone's gotta stay on
the plane and do the hard work.

14:14.002 --> 14:15.848
Gunny, check the palletized
gear and equipment.

14:15.873 --> 14:18.055
Lima team, load up. Let's go get some.

14:18.105 --> 14:19.983
Oo-rah.

14:20.065 --> 14:22.240
Boo-yah! Boo-yah.

15:22.193 --> 15:23.659
Hector.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.012
Okay.

15:30.939 --> 15:32.409
Octavio.

15:44.572 --> 15:46.369
Hector...

17:57.886 --> 17:59.686
You know, I always wondered
why Navy corpsman

17:59.711 --> 18:01.250
deploy with the Marines.

18:01.896 --> 18:04.766
'Cause the Marines like to fight, sir.

18:06.913 --> 18:08.519
I-I mean, I...

18:08.544 --> 18:10.472
I'm... I'm not saying
that y'all don't, sir.

18:10.497 --> 18:12.096
I was just, um...

18:12.286 --> 18:13.955
You know, I meant that, um...

18:14.203 --> 18:16.451
I was saying that we...

18:16.732 --> 18:18.593
Take it easy, corpsman.

18:18.696 --> 18:20.059
Save your energy.

18:20.122 --> 18:21.333
Yes, sir.

18:23.659 --> 18:25.866
So, you guys work out?

18:26.833 --> 18:30.143
C'mon. Thought you bastards
were supposed to be fun.

18:30.469 --> 18:32.348
We've been waiting like 50 years

18:32.373 --> 18:35.361
to invade this shit-box
island, am I right?

18:36.306 --> 18:38.262
My mother's Cuban.

18:43.970 --> 18:45.265
Command, this is Liberty One.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.550
We're leaving American airspace

18:46.575 --> 18:48.451
and proceeding on schedule. Over.

18:48.646 --> 18:50.139
Copy that, Liberty One.

18:50.199 --> 18:52.043
<i>Nathan James</i>
is in range to jam the radar

18:52.068 --> 18:53.349
in the Cuban artillery batteries.

18:53.374 --> 18:54.938
Stand by.

18:55.824 --> 18:57.597
HF feed is holding up.

18:57.925 --> 18:59.900
Wish we had better eyes
on the battlefield.

19:00.027 --> 19:01.082
Yes, sir.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.526
Without satellites,
this will have to do.

19:04.113 --> 19:05.520
Ensign, we ready?

19:05.827 --> 19:07.182
All set, Admiral.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.433
Okay.

19:09.986 --> 19:11.586
Liberty One, Command.

19:11.879 --> 19:13.840
You are clear to proceed.

19:14.469 --> 19:18.190
Navy Spear, sending jam package now.

19:18.899 --> 19:21.298
Commence jamming sequence on your end.

19:23.609 --> 19:25.079
Aye.

19:27.273 --> 19:29.118
Jamming sequence initiated.

19:29.592 --> 19:31.398
Liberty One, Navy Spear.

19:31.543 --> 19:33.062
Cuba's blind, and they don't know it.

19:33.087 --> 19:34.947
Copy that, Navy Spear.

19:35.126 --> 19:37.168
Ground winds out of the northwest...

19:37.258 --> 19:38.783
1-5 knots.

19:38.884 --> 19:41.171
Deploy chutes 9,000.

19:41.646 --> 19:44.274
Jump Team, Flight Lead.
2-minute warning.

19:44.493 --> 19:47.915
Lima team, stand by.
2 minutes, 2 minutes.

19:48.849 --> 19:50.148
2 minutes.

19:50.233 --> 19:51.762
2 minutes.

19:57.872 --> 19:59.157
Good luck.

20:00.736 --> 20:02.139
Oo-rah.

20:04.889 --> 20:06.758
All right, go!

20:12.925 --> 20:14.299
Go!

20:20.102 --> 20:21.542
Go!

20:23.953 --> 20:25.553
Go!

20:30.916 --> 20:33.393
All teams, Command. Jamming's holding.

20:33.446 --> 20:34.845
You have another 40 seconds.

20:34.906 --> 20:36.436
Navy Spear, roger that.

20:43.391 --> 20:45.352
- <i>We're good. Let's go.</i>
- Weapons supply away.

20:45.399 --> 20:47.702
Uplink confirmed. Nav system engaged.

20:49.926 --> 20:52.085
Aye, sir. I have control of the cache.

20:52.157 --> 20:53.626
Deploying the chute now.

21:02.319 --> 21:04.718
Unknown air track.
Inbound, Liberty One.

21:24.193 --> 21:25.740
What the hell is going on over there?

21:25.813 --> 21:27.219
- Flight Lead, come in. Come in.
- Liberty One,

21:27.243 --> 21:29.224
Liberty One, this is Command.

21:36.785 --> 21:38.265
We have a missile detonation.

21:38.290 --> 21:41.113
Target's trajectory leading
back to the north side of Cuba.

21:41.266 --> 21:44.465
Liberty One is hit and going down.

21:58.259 --> 22:00.259
Flight Lead, what's your status?

22:02.506 --> 22:04.706
Flight Lead, do you copy?!

22:30.658 --> 22:31.988
What the hell?!

22:32.105 --> 22:33.634
Did everyone egress?

22:36.955 --> 22:38.596
No.

22:38.692 --> 22:40.016
No.

22:40.671 --> 22:41.931
No.

22:42.108 --> 22:43.368
No, no.

22:43.801 --> 22:45.287
Lima, Command.

22:45.385 --> 22:46.718
What is your status?

22:47.026 --> 22:49.749
Our status is goddamn livid, Admiral.

22:49.828 --> 22:52.525
Why weren't we jamming
those artillery batteries?

22:57.043 --> 22:58.290
We're gonna get you some answers.

22:58.315 --> 23:00.545
This is Dufine.
I wanna speak to Captain Utt.

23:02.472 --> 23:05.141
Command, Utt. Lima team has landed.

23:05.295 --> 23:09.862
No sign of Bowen, Lin, Murphy,
Weeks, Santora, or Hird.

23:11.179 --> 23:13.318
Mostly likely they were K.I.A.

23:13.665 --> 23:16.489
Looks like Liberty One
was shot out of the sky.

23:16.815 --> 23:18.415
Pilots were on course.

23:18.658 --> 23:20.434
Jamming was set.

23:20.638 --> 23:22.837
We had no early warning.

23:24.065 --> 23:26.690
Admiral Chandler
was also on board, ma'am.

23:30.952 --> 23:32.267
Command, Navy Spear.

23:32.317 --> 23:34.517
Commencing search and rescue now.

23:35.801 --> 23:37.600
Helm, all ahead, 2/3.

23:40.178 --> 23:41.763
Gear is off target.

23:41.931 --> 23:43.261
No confirm on beacon.

23:43.558 --> 23:45.287
It must be out of range.

23:56.047 --> 23:58.382
Mother, can we get a fix
on that weapons supply?

23:59.260 --> 24:01.526
We were tracking it using
a radar relay from the plane.

24:01.551 --> 24:04.501
Last position, supply was off-course,

24:04.575 --> 24:07.978
headed west on a path toward
the north shore of Havana.

24:09.238 --> 24:11.262
That's Gustavo country.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.545
The rebel camp is 3 miles
in the other direction.

24:14.701 --> 24:16.087
Why don't we go there first?

24:16.112 --> 24:19.711
No. We secure the gear.
Then we find the rebels.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.198
You wanna walk into Havana

24:21.245 --> 24:23.856
with half our team and no firepower?

24:23.945 --> 24:25.260
We can't risk letting those weapons

24:25.285 --> 24:26.753
fall into the wrong hands.

24:26.820 --> 24:27.938
I agree.

24:28.022 --> 24:29.426
We don't have a choice.

24:29.588 --> 24:31.621
They know we're here,
so we have to move fast.

24:31.694 --> 24:33.133
That beacon has a 2-mile range.

24:33.158 --> 24:36.348
If we can get in the area,
I know we can find it.

24:40.098 --> 24:41.928
Mission hasn't changed.

24:45.864 --> 24:47.437
Roger that.

24:48.444 --> 24:49.677
Command, Utt.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.736
We are proceeding feet dry
in search of weapons supply.

24:52.984 --> 24:54.914
Update when we arrive.

24:56.857 --> 24:58.181
Copy all.

25:07.257 --> 25:09.838
Ma'am, based on its speed
and trajectory,

25:09.863 --> 25:11.482
the plane could have
gone down anywhere here.

25:11.622 --> 25:14.762
If we're looking for a debris
field, it could be miles long.

25:17.132 --> 25:18.493
Let's get that bird in the air.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.366
Aye, ma'am. I'm going to CIC.

25:20.391 --> 25:21.591
The bridge is yours.

25:21.635 --> 25:23.019
Roger.

25:41.914 --> 25:43.848
Aah!

26:05.624 --> 26:08.357
This entire borough's
a hotbed for Cuban military.

26:09.222 --> 26:10.746
Just that kinda day.

26:10.912 --> 26:12.711
Gear's close.

26:12.955 --> 26:14.885
Whole thing could've
been picked over by now.

26:15.222 --> 26:17.477
Barco, take Green and see
if you can get eyes on.

26:17.558 --> 26:19.687
- Aye, sir.
- Let's go.

26:20.399 --> 26:21.661
Let's do it.

26:25.182 --> 26:26.388
Hey, ma'am.

26:26.413 --> 26:27.843
Ma'am, your neck is bleeding.

26:29.975 --> 26:31.035
It's... It's nothing.

26:31.060 --> 26:32.295
- I didn't even feel it.
- No.

26:32.408 --> 26:34.832
You probably just got nicked
by the shrapnel from the blast.

26:35.096 --> 26:37.300
Here, just apply pressure. Okay?

26:59.516 --> 27:00.964
Aah!

27:05.827 --> 27:08.137
Aaaahhh!

28:06.679 --> 28:09.018
Package is across
the street behind the bar.

28:09.186 --> 28:11.191
Can't get eyes on it yet,
but it's there.

28:11.316 --> 28:13.053
Could be on the rooftop.

28:13.250 --> 28:14.351
Half the city's awake,

28:14.376 --> 28:16.323
and the other half will be up soon.

28:16.716 --> 28:17.985
Let's move.

28:36.722 --> 28:38.391
Debris field scattered.

28:38.546 --> 28:40.267
No sign of life.

28:41.947 --> 28:43.581
Hell.

28:53.072 --> 28:54.612
Anyone else hearing that?

28:56.526 --> 28:59.147
Mother, I'm picking up
something strong here.

28:59.309 --> 29:01.918
Copy that, Brawler. We see it.

29:02.788 --> 29:05.218
Looks like it's headed
to the port at Matanzas.

29:05.436 --> 29:07.175
Navy Spear, what do you see?

29:07.373 --> 29:09.808
We don't have an I.D. yet, sir,
but it's huge.

29:09.862 --> 29:10.992
It's got the same signature

29:11.017 --> 29:12.546
as the ship we fought
at the Yucatán Strait.

29:13.972 --> 29:16.188
You said you hit
that battleship pretty hard.

29:16.392 --> 29:17.521
Yeah.

29:17.802 --> 29:19.459
No worse than she hit <i> Nathan James.</i>

29:19.484 --> 29:21.367
She's a monster.

29:23.018 --> 29:27.056
The radar jamming was focused
on the artillery batteries.

29:27.883 --> 29:29.456
If that ship was patrolling the waters

29:29.481 --> 29:31.771
over the horizon from the <i> Nathan James,</i>

29:33.481 --> 29:35.781
it would have had
a clear look at Liberty One.

29:41.346 --> 29:43.061
This wasn't on you, Ensign.

29:46.462 --> 29:49.028
Bridge, Captain. Set course to 2-4-5.

29:49.095 --> 29:51.386
Course 2-4-5, aye.

29:54.372 --> 29:55.771
This time, we sink her.

29:55.973 --> 29:57.430
Ready all VLS.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.496
Aye, ma'am.

30:23.716 --> 30:25.315
Vamos.

30:47.419 --> 30:48.768
Hector...

31:12.176 --> 31:13.487
Hmm?

32:08.192 --> 32:10.319
Looks like we're in over our heads.

32:12.543 --> 32:14.495
Have to take it piece by piece.

32:15.136 --> 32:16.406
Toone, cut her down.

32:16.486 --> 32:17.885
Yes, sir.

32:17.966 --> 32:19.765
The rest of us, underneath.

32:34.316 --> 32:35.941
El Gallo.

32:53.252 --> 32:54.651
Fuentes.

32:56.048 --> 32:57.511
Admiral.

32:57.734 --> 32:59.669
Leader of the Cuban rebels.

33:00.352 --> 33:02.021
We have a lot to discuss.

33:07.974 --> 33:09.373
Closing in on the target, ma'am.

33:09.398 --> 33:11.099
1,500 yards.

33:11.962 --> 33:14.462
We should see them
when we get around the bend.

33:18.752 --> 33:20.322
We lost the signature.

33:20.496 --> 33:22.896
It's okay.
She's trapped in the bay now.

33:24.171 --> 33:26.688
OOD, slow to 3 knots.
Stand by to maneuver.

33:26.819 --> 33:29.760
Aye, ma'am.
Helm, all ahead 1/3 for 3 knots.

33:29.875 --> 33:31.207
Helm, aye.

33:56.016 --> 33:57.071
Prepare to fire

33:57.096 --> 33:59.165
as soon as we get eyes on that ship.

33:59.289 --> 34:01.018
Aye.

34:16.266 --> 34:17.726
Where the hell'd it go?

34:17.886 --> 34:19.885
There's no other way
out of this harbor.

34:34.538 --> 34:36.366
We got the weight, Toone. Cut it.

34:36.417 --> 34:37.842
Yep.

34:40.449 --> 34:42.786
Bring it up. Careful.

34:43.505 --> 34:45.005
Set it down.

35:10.294 --> 35:11.424
Hey!

35:16.687 --> 35:18.287
Oh!

35:45.888 --> 35:46.956
Aye.

36:27.990 --> 36:30.690
Americanos! Americanos!

36:37.550 --> 36:39.019
Holy shit!

36:44.121 --> 36:46.238
I need some help here!

36:52.304 --> 36:53.552
Mother, Lima.

36:53.577 --> 36:55.681
We're trapped in the courtyard,
and contact is imminent.

36:55.706 --> 36:58.105
Request emergency evac
at my location. Over.

36:58.130 --> 36:59.869
Lima, Navy Spear.

36:59.941 --> 37:02.740
Helo is 20 mikes from your posit. Over.

37:05.642 --> 37:07.441
Push!

37:08.284 --> 37:10.354
Push!

37:10.588 --> 37:12.028
They're gonna ram it!

37:12.091 --> 37:14.420
Kandie, set a claymore on that door.

37:17.551 --> 37:19.139
Hold it. Push.

37:19.286 --> 37:20.774
Push!

37:27.799 --> 37:28.996
We're set.

37:29.070 --> 37:30.999
Lima team, on my command, drop back.

37:31.046 --> 37:32.171
All guns on the door.

37:32.204 --> 37:33.803
When they breach, give 'em hell.

37:38.706 --> 37:40.435
Drop back, drop back!

37:48.143 --> 37:49.750
I didn't jump out of a plane

37:49.775 --> 37:51.904
to get killed by friendly fire.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.716
You guys wanna lower your weapons?

37:59.959 --> 38:01.686
You're clear.

38:05.326 --> 38:06.793
Package secure?

38:16.476 --> 38:19.709
The street's contained,
but we need to leave... now.

38:20.883 --> 38:23.015
Welcome to Cuba.

38:23.309 --> 38:25.220
Vámonos.

38:45.899 --> 38:48.853
Smokes, thermites, and frags.

38:48.929 --> 38:50.313
You got it all.

39:00.066 --> 39:01.395
Systems check.

39:02.225 --> 39:03.694
Got that?

39:03.766 --> 39:06.973
You know, for a Navy man,
you're not bad with a rifle.

39:08.769 --> 39:11.639
Yeah, well, for a Marine,
you're not bad as a doorstop.

39:13.009 --> 39:14.349
Get a room.

39:17.123 --> 39:20.475
Then we'll have to take the
airfield, the capital building,

39:20.635 --> 39:23.503
the presidential palace,
and then the radio station.

39:23.746 --> 39:26.206
Sounds like you got
everything under control.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.415
It's been a difficult few months,

39:28.713 --> 39:30.716
but the worst is still ahead.

39:31.923 --> 39:34.438
Thank you for living up to your end,

39:34.737 --> 39:36.931
even though you had
no reason to trust me.

39:42.315 --> 39:43.925
Disparen.

39:48.156 --> 39:49.356
Disparen.

40:14.276 --> 40:15.415
Disparen!

40:15.576 --> 40:17.645
Viva Tavo!

41:14.731 --> 41:16.555
<i>Coming in from the west side,</i>

41:16.580 --> 41:18.510
<i>- as well as from the center.
- That's great.</i>

41:45.324 --> 41:46.838
Hey, Kelsi?
