(Grunts)

00:20.313 --> 00:21.928
(Bleep)

00:22.523 --> 00:24.388
(Over phone) Batiste, this is Thaddeus, man.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.858
I'm fining Mario, 'cause he took a gig
with Shannon Powell tonight,

00:27.987 --> 00:31.946
and | only found out when
I ran into Shannon at Dizzy's. A'ight?

00:32.074 --> 00:33.234
— A'ight.

(Female voice) Message deleted.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.692
(Over phone) Yo, this is Herman, man.

00:36.829 --> 00:40.617
Some motherfucker stole my hi—hat cymbals
out of the back of the van last night.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.583
Cornell was supposed to lock that shit up
when we went back into the bar,

00:43.711 --> 00:47.545
so tell Cornell -
unless he kicks out for that shit, I'm out.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.755

00:49.884 --> 00:52.967
(Mario over phone) Antoine, I told you about
the gig with Shannon Powell last week.

00:53.095 --> 00:57.088
You remember? What the fuck, man?
You gonna fine me 'cause you didn't tell Thad?

00:57.225 --> 00:58.931
— Crazy!

00:59.060 --> 01:00.675

01:00.811 --> 01:05.054
(Cornell) Yo, Batiste. You tell Herman Jackson
my heart pumps purple piss for him.

01:05.191 --> 01:09.434
l locked that god damn van.
Sucker probably left that tin in the club, man.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.525
(Beep)

01:10.655 --> 01:12.020
Message deleted.

01:12.156 --> 01:14.272
(Over phone) This is Wanda, Antoine,

01:14.408 --> 01:19.198
and you ain't got no business even thinking
about asking me back into that band,

01:19.330 --> 01:21.571
not the way you carry on. Huh!

01:21.707 --> 01:22.696
I'm out.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.414
Next message.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.454
Hey, Batiste. lt's Tim.

01:26.587 --> 01:31.251
I'm touring with Irma in May, and you're
gonna need to get a tenor for at least that long.

01:31.384 --> 01:34.046
Sorry, man.
lrma's paying real money on it.

01:34.178 --> 01:35.884
- (Beep)
— Message deleted.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.219
(Wanda) And another thing —

01:37.348 --> 01:39.555
if I was to come back and sing some,

01:39.684 --> 01:43.427
then you need to shut your hole
while I'm doing it.

01:43.562 --> 01:47.601
And if Cornell and Thad think
they sing background harmony with me

01:47.733 --> 01:48.893
on Do Right Woman,

01:49.026 --> 01:52.234
they're gonna have to pick one key
and stick with it.

01:52.363 --> 01:55.150
Those two get a half step
near each other and, ooh, Lord...

01:56.534 --> 01:58.070
(Sighs)

03:34.965 --> 03:36.580
(Janette) Not bad, right?

03:38.135 --> 03:41.298
— And you like the lawyer?
— I do. Knows her stuff, I think.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.341
Good. Great.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.727
So how's business?

03:50.856 --> 03:54.690
lt's picking up now that Jazz Fest is coming,
but still not what it was.

03:54.819 --> 03:56.775
— How's New York?
- Crazy.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.270
Sometimes bad crazy, sometimes good.

03:59.407 --> 04:02.149
Lately it's been good.
I've been cooking for David Chang.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.820
— Lucky Peach?
- Uh-huh.

04:03.953 --> 04:06.695
Just when you think you've seen it all,
that guy shows you something new.

04:06.831 --> 04:09.197
— He's amazing, really.
— Yes, totally.

04:09.333 --> 04:12.825
— But New York's been good for me, I think.
- (Bell clanging)

04:12.962 --> 04:16.375
— What the fuck? They're back?
- (Bell continues)

04:16.507 --> 04:18.372
— When did they come back?
— December.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.500
Butjust from here on Canal up to Lee Circle.

04:20.636 --> 04:25.221
— Beyond that, the rest of the line's still closed.
— How much time do we have?

04:25.349 --> 04:26.429
Come on!

04:39.655 --> 04:41.646
(Bell clanging)

04:56.464 --> 04:59.046
- You OK?
— I'm fine, yeah.

05:03.888 --> 05:06.425
Which is why I need to see that homicide file.

05:06.557 --> 05:08.718
See what isn't there, what they didn't do.

05:08.851 --> 05:11.137
Public Records Act request will be denied.

05:11.270 --> 05:13.477
— Open investigation.
— Of course.

05:13.606 --> 05:16.393
Besides, by asking for it,
you're telegraphing them.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.561
Whatever isn't sanitized in that file right now,

05:18.694 --> 05:21.481
they're gonna start cleaning up
right after you make the request, right?

05:21.614 --> 05:23.229
I might have fucked that up already.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.903
- How so?
— I thought I had a friend in Homicide.

05:27.036 --> 05:29.322
You already asked for the file?

05:29.455 --> 05:31.161
Yeah, maybe you tipped your hand.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.997
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.411
If I could see that file,

05:35.544 --> 05:39.537
I'd be able to start picking apart
their investigation, or non—investigation.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.129
But without it...

05:46.639 --> 05:48.220
Maybe I'll go see Judge Prieur.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.009
—(Laughs)
- What?

05:50.142 --> 05:52.349
The man mentored me.
Raised me from a pup, he did.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.594
If there's a move to be made...

05:55.606 --> 05:57.642
Toni, l, um...

05:58.817 --> 06:02.355
I need you to take some of my casework.
The civil rights stuff, anyway.

06:02.488 --> 06:04.524
Why?

06:04.657 --> 06:08.070
Barry was able to wrangle a transfer
to the Birmingham office.

06:08.202 --> 06:11.114
We're, um... We're leaving.

06:11.247 --> 06:12.828
Birmingham, Alabama?

06:12.957 --> 06:16.165
Two more houses on our block
were burglarized last week.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.875
If it was just me and Barry, maybe.
But the kids...

06:19.004 --> 06:22.292
We can't live like this, not anymore.

06:22.424 --> 06:26.087
We've been thinking about it since Helen Hill,
but after last week...

06:27.513 --> 06:29.299
You do what's right for you.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.137
lam.

06:33.602 --> 06:34.808
All rise.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.643
This Court of Immigration review,

06:36.772 --> 06:39.354
Judge Roland Turnwell presiding,
is now in session.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.394
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.

06:42.653 --> 06:44.109
All right. Bail reviews.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.819
Who's first up, Miss Boyer?

06:45.948 --> 06:48.109
Case number 07078, Your Honor.

06:48.242 --> 06:51.905
All right, here it is.
The defendant on hand, I hope?

06:53.414 --> 06:55.575
(Chains rattling)

07:11.432 --> 07:15.300
Nine lands and grooves
with a left twist on a .380 slug.

07:16.604 --> 07:19.471
You're looking for a Hi—Point.
Model CF-380.

07:19.607 --> 07:22.314
— Manufactured after 2000.
- That's pretty specific.

07:22.443 --> 07:25.685
Nine L&G with a left twist — that's kinda rare.

07:27.364 --> 07:30.822
Forgive the dumb question —
ljust got to Homicide.

07:30.951 --> 07:35.240
Any way to compare that bullet with casings,
if we had casings?

07:35.372 --> 07:39.786
No way could I compare casings to slugs
and tell you it's the same gun.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.658
Best I could do is tell you the same model.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.162
To say it's the same gun,
I would need to compare slug to slug

07:45.299 --> 07:46.960
— or casing to casing?
- Exactly.

07:47.092 --> 07:51.131
And that other bullet — too mutilated
to say what she is, sorry to say.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.722
(Quiet chatter, laughter)

07:57.144 --> 08:01.057
All right, look, make sure you call me
the day before any court date.

08:01.190 --> 08:04.148
We don't want to mess up
and have them issue a retake warrant.

08:04.276 --> 08:08.189
If that happens, you're gonna lose that house
you put up for the surety bond,

08:08.322 --> 08:10.108
and you're gonna lose a grill man.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.367
No, l... lwill be careful.

08:12.493 --> 08:16.987
Until the next hearing, stay out of trouble
and stay in touch with my office.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.704
— Yeah, lwill. Thank you.
— Take care.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.868
- Bye.
— Bye. Thank you.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.708
Whew. Welcome home, Jacques.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.799
— Do I still have a job?
- You kidding?

08:27.925 --> 08:30.291
— You're on the grill tomorrow night.
— Thank you.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.294
— Congrats. Janette.
- Bye, Susan.

08:35.474 --> 08:39.012
— Well, that you offered your house...
- (Streetcar bell)

08:39.144 --> 08:40.884
Why not? It's an empty wreck.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.262
Oh, but still, thank you.

08:45.776 --> 08:48.859
— When do you go back to New York?
— I got a morning flight.

08:48.987 --> 08:52.479
I gotta be back for service tomorrow.
But hey, I'm in New Orleans now.

08:52.616 --> 08:56.108
What do you wanna do?
Your first day back in the world? Huh?

08:56.245 --> 08:58.281
Uh...

09:07.131 --> 09:09.122
(Tran) Hey, Don.
(Don) Tran, what's up?

09:10.926 --> 09:12.837
(Tran) Everything OK?

09:18.142 --> 09:20.224
(Chatting quietly)

09:28.193 --> 09:30.184
(Tap squeaks, water stops)

09:33.490 --> 09:35.776
— The fuck did I do?
— You tell me.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.743
He wants you on his shrimp boat
tomorrow morning. 6:00am out of Chalmette.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.535
— I'm here with you, brah.
- No, you ain't.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.249
| just traded you to Tran.
For the week, anyway.

09:46.378 --> 09:47.754
You traded me?

09:47.880 --> 09:48.995
(Laughs)

09:49.131 --> 09:51.463
— What did you get in return?
— Two new air hose,

09:51.592 --> 09:55.335
a half—dozen crab traps
and a player to be named later.

09:55.471 --> 09:56.836
(Laughs)

09:59.183 --> 10:00.844
(Don continues laughing)

10:40.265 --> 10:41.471
I'm really busy today.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.808
I need the casings that you have,
the ones from the Seals crime scene.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.394
— I'm working the case, Toni.
— Oh, you are, huh?

10:47.523 --> 10:50.515
Shouldn't I worry that they're gonna disappear
like every piece of evidence

10:50.651 --> 10:53.393
that's ever handed over to you people?

10:54.738 --> 10:56.319
Receipt for evidence.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.439
Two casings, signed and dated.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.487
You're covered.
l'm responsible, all right?

11:03.705 --> 11:06.788
If the receipt isn't enough,
she's a witness to whatever you hand me.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.077
That's first of all.

11:08.210 --> 11:12.294
Second of all, you're withholding evidence
in an ongoing homicide investigation,

11:12.422 --> 11:14.959
and you're an officer of the court.
And more than that,

11:15.092 --> 11:18.676
you're fucking up whatever weak—ass chain
of custody those casings might have.

11:18.804 --> 11:22.092
Are you really gonna make me call
for a warrant on this fucking office?

11:22.224 --> 11:24.340
Is that where we're going, Toni?

11:28.981 --> 11:32.439
(Metal drawer sliding and banging)

11:59.970 --> 12:01.426
(Door closes)

12:02.431 --> 12:04.422
And the taxes are quite low.

12:04.558 --> 12:08.551
Well, the real value is the liquor license,
if it conveys.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.598
Of course it does.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.939
Unusual shelf work back there.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.938
Top shelf to bottom, nothing's level.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.113
My father built those.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.453
'67, I think.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.283
Just before he went off to Vietnam.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.202
Let me show you the roof.

12:35.339 --> 12:38.001
Brand—new. 20—year seal tab.

12:39.343 --> 12:40.753
Motherfuckers.

12:40.886 --> 12:43.047
Wanda, Thad, Herman — all of them.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.216
One after the next with excuses and bitching.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.089
And all of them either late or missing.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.965
And Thad is the fucking straw boss!

12:49.102 --> 12:52.139
— Can't get none of them on the phone?
- Nah, they all ducking me, brah.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.649
Most of them making
more money elsewhere, bro.

12:54.775 --> 12:58.768
- Shut up. Shit.
— Trombone, trumpet, guitar, bass.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.440
We can't do the gig like that, man.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.984
Yeah, I know that.
We got a good crowd too.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.368
— So, uh, this is the gig?
— Huh?

13:05.494 --> 13:07.860
Thad called me,
asked to sub for him on keyboard tonight.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.578
He said he's feeling sick.
Y'all play R&B, right?

13:10.707 --> 13:13.790
- Where's your fucking ax?
— I got all my shit set up by the Hi Ho.

13:13.919 --> 13:16.205
I gotta play there at eleven,
but I can give you one set at least.

13:16.338 --> 13:19.080
— What?
— You don't have Thad's keyboard?

13:19.216 --> 13:21.798
Hell, no! Fuck!

13:22.594 --> 13:26.633
See, that's it. See? It's gonna end right here.
I'm sick of this shit, all of it.

13:26.765 --> 13:30.053
So fuck all of y'all and fuck
being the fucking sad ass in charge.

13:30.185 --> 13:32.847
Dealing with this shit is like raking leaves
on a windy fucking day.

13:32.980 --> 13:36.097
But you know what? The motherfucking
leaves are always talking shit back to you.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.724
So fuck it. I'm done! We done!

13:38.860 --> 13:41.567
I quit! Shit.

13:41.697 --> 13:44.029
And, miss, you need to get that law degree,

13:44.157 --> 13:47.194
'cause this here is for suckers, chumps.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.033
And a law degree isn't?

13:49.162 --> 13:52.495
When I can start charging for this
in billable hours, we can talk.

13:52.624 --> 13:56.583
Until then, baby,
you've got a better future elsewhere.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.792
See y'all around.

14:00.924 --> 14:03.381
You'll see me tomorrow, right?
For your boy at the school.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.966
Yeah, yeah, cool.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.677
Shit.

14:11.601 --> 14:12.727
Fuck.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.468
So no gig?

14:17.024 --> 14:18.605
(Sighs)

14:22.529 --> 14:25.441
— How do you feel?
- Strange.

14:25.574 --> 14:28.657
- I bet.
— Like a mistake has been made.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.070
No mistake.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.910
- (Band playing)
— (Crowd cheering)

14:38.795 --> 14:40.831
J‘ What you gonna do
when the well runs dry?

14:40.964 --> 14:42.955
J‘ Are you gonna run away and hide?

14:43.091 --> 14:45.173
J‘ I'm gonna be right by your side

14:45.302 --> 14:46.963
J‘ Pack your bags

15:04.404 --> 15:05.393
(J‘ Jazz playing)

15:05.530 --> 15:08.363
- Where's he at tonight?
— (Delmond) Using my hotel room.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.483
Probably ordering room service for two.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.860
He's doing work with
the documentary lady tonight?

15:12.996 --> 15:15.282
Yeah, they're gonna be up late, editing.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.371
(Laughs)

15:19.503 --> 15:22.995
How long...
has he been living here like this?

15:23.131 --> 15:25.543
Since fall.
Before that, he was in the bar.

15:25.675 --> 15:28.337
— The bar?
— Long story.

15:31.515 --> 15:33.005
Well...

15:33.141 --> 15:36.850
you all cooked a hell of a meal
with a grill and a hotplate.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.185
Just roll me back to my hotel.

15:40.398 --> 15:43.561
We still got dessert coming.
Strap on that helmet, get back in the game.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.184
— (Cheri) That's right.
- No!

15:47.531 --> 15:49.863
Anyway, before this one keels over...

15:57.707 --> 15:59.447
Thank you.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.373
15 thou. Is that enough?

16:09.177 --> 16:11.668
Yeah, fix up the roof,
get some electrical in here.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.547
Get that much done,
place might almost be livable again.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.852
- Think he'll believe it?
— We'll just dress it up some,

16:17.978 --> 16:20.390
tell him it's selling big in Sweden,
Switzerland or some shit.

16:20.522 --> 16:24.390
Now, I know where me and Cheri
got our part from, but...

16:24.526 --> 16:26.517
where you get $5,000 from, Delmond?

16:26.653 --> 16:29.190
l'm—a have to pack up
the New York apartment.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.779
I've given my notice,
I'll be out by the end of the month.

16:31.908 --> 16:35.742
I'll save money living here,
helping Daddy fix up the house.

16:35.871 --> 16:37.987
(Woodrow) Hmm.

16:39.249 --> 16:42.036
I'd like to kick in some of my own.

16:43.211 --> 16:44.792
We'll take it up to an even 20.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.877
(Cheri) Wow.
(Davina) Woodrow.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.122
Thank you.

16:50.886 --> 16:54.595
Just don't tell anyone. Word gets around,
I'll get laughed out of the music business.

16:54.723 --> 16:57.715
No problem. I'll tell people
you fucked me on my royalties

16:57.851 --> 17:00.092
and took off with my publishing
like every other cat out there.

17:00.228 --> 17:03.095
- I appreciate it.
— Anything for you, brah.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.311
(All laugh)

17:04.441 --> 17:06.648
— (Tuning guitar)
— (Crowd cheering)

17:06.776 --> 17:08.061
Hey, man.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.778
Uh, guys, what the fuck?

17:15.911 --> 17:18.698
— The fuck are you doing here?
- They didn't tell you?

17:18.830 --> 17:20.866
- Tell me what?
— I thought you told him.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.910
Alex is in the band, man.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.203
— He's good.
— What?

17:24.336 --> 17:27.043
I mean, Davis, this dude be killing it, man.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.584
— You can't fight his funk.
- Yeah, I can.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.707
l... I can fight it.

17:31.843 --> 17:35.802
Brah, our shit's stronger with Alex
and you're still fronting with Calliope, right?

17:35.931 --> 17:37.887
— Fuck!
— Come on.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.507
You know, just fuck it, all right?

17:40.644 --> 17:43.977
Liza Jane, Wolf, Not One Word,
Road Home, Nagin's Lament.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.094
Cool.

17:45.232 --> 17:48.349
— And save The True for the second set.
— OK.

17:48.485 --> 17:51.443
Plus me and Ty worked up something new.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.404
— Really? Great, I can't wait to hear it.
- Don't be like that.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.899
OK, any more surprises?
Somebody fucking my girlfriend?

17:58.036 --> 17:59.276
Don't be like that.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.073
Come on. Come here.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.954
(Crowd cheering)

18:15.303 --> 18:17.385
(Both vocalizing)

18:23.270 --> 18:25.761
J‘ Name of that girl Miss Liza Jane

18:25.897 --> 18:28.183
J‘ That girl with the big behind

18:28.316 --> 18:30.147
J‘ Little Liza Jane

18:30.277 --> 18:33.144
J‘ When that starts a—shaking,
she blows my mind now

18:33.280 --> 18:34.986
J‘ Little Liza Jane

18:35.615 --> 18:37.947
J‘ I got a girl who broke my heart

18:38.076 --> 18:40.032
J‘ Little Liza Jane

18:40.161 --> 18:42.823
J‘ And she made me suffer
on account of my art now

18:42.956 --> 18:45.698
— J‘ Little Liza Jane
— J‘ Oh, don't you know

18:45.834 --> 18:50.828
— J‘ Oh, Little Liza, Little Liza Jane
— J‘ And away we go

18:50.964 --> 18:55.754
— J‘ Oh, Little Liza, Little Liza Jane
- J‘ Flowing out your nose

18:55.885 --> 18:59.548
J‘ Oh, Little Liza, Little Liza Jane

18:59.681 --> 19:00.966
J‘ And away we go now

19:01.099 --> 19:05.012
J‘ Oh, Little Liza, Little Liza Jane

19:05.145 --> 19:08.103
— J‘ Say I met this girl in Baltimore...
— (Crowd cheering loudly)

19:08.231 --> 19:09.971
J‘ Little Liza Jane

19:10.108 --> 19:12.941
J‘ You see, her brother's on the level,
won't see her no more now

19:13.069 --> 19:14.855
J‘ Little Liza Jane

19:14.988 --> 19:17.730
J‘ Then I came down south
to New Orleans

19:17.866 --> 19:19.697
J‘ Little Liza Jane

19:19.826 --> 19:22.693
J‘ She was the prettiest thing
that you ever could see

19:22.829 --> 19:25.536
- J‘ Little Liza Jane
— J‘ Ooh, Little Liza Jane

19:25.665 --> 19:29.249
J‘ Oh, Little Liza, Little Liza Jane

19:29.377 --> 19:34.167
— J‘ Little Liza Jane
— J‘ Oh, Little Liza, Little Liza Jane

19:34.299 --> 19:39.089
— J‘ Yadda, yadda, yadda, yo!
— J‘ Oh, Little Liza, Little Liza Jane

19:39.220 --> 19:44.806
- J‘ Oodley, oodley, oodley, oh
— J‘ Oh, Little Liza, Little Liza Jane

19:44.934 --> 19:46.799
J‘ I say, OK, I got a girl,
probably wouldn't understand...

19:46.936 --> 19:49.723
— (Loud cheering)
— J‘ She's 5'7", blonde hair, no tan

19:49.856 --> 19:52.393
J‘ She's a crazy mother mother,
she's a little insane

19:52.525 --> 19:54.686
— J‘ What's the name of that girl?
— J‘ Miss Liza Jane

19:54.819 --> 19:57.435
J‘ I say, I met her hanging
out by the HOB

19:57.572 --> 19:59.858
J‘ She was drinking and dancing
like nobody could see

19:59.991 --> 20:02.528
J‘ But I saw your feet bopping
on the top of that car

20:05.663 --> 20:10.407
— J‘ Oh, Little Liza, Little Liza Jane
— J‘ Baby, don't you go

20:10.543 --> 20:14.286
— J‘ Oh, Little Liza, Little Liza Jane
- J‘ Hey, hey... J‘

20:14.422 --> 20:16.413
(Gulls calling)

20:24.849 --> 20:27.261
Man, I told you not to ask that girl out.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.477
Really? I remember you telling me
l was hopeless if I didn't.

20:30.605 --> 20:34.644
Well, that too,
but at least you'd be hopeless and living.

20:34.776 --> 20:37.813
Now you're getting ready to go out
with these Vietnamese cats,

20:37.946 --> 20:40.904
— you might not come back.
- What you mean, man?

20:41.032 --> 20:43.944
Shrimp boat, baby.
They ain't oystermen.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.942
They going way the fuck out in the Gulf.

20:46.079 --> 20:49.162
Gone for three, four days, usually.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.123
Where the hell you been?
Let's go! It's late!

20:52.252 --> 20:54.459
— Just how pretty is she to you?
— (Chuckles)

20:56.840 --> 20:59.627
Yo, you don't come back,
| get your guitar, right?

21:00.468 --> 21:02.049
Hey, this one time...

21:02.178 --> 21:03.839
(Laughs)

21:04.973 --> 21:07.180
— You got it? Go to work.
- Yes.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.390
Let's move! (Shouts in Vietnamese)

21:10.520 --> 21:12.602
(Shouts in Vietnamese)

21:24.284 --> 21:26.946
(Traffic passing, people chatting outside)

21:46.431 --> 21:47.637
(Sighs)

21:47.765 --> 21:49.847
(Dog barking outside)

21:52.729 --> 21:54.970
One, two, three...

21:56.232 --> 21:58.097
(Plays scale)

22:03.114 --> 22:05.491
That's it. Better.

22:06.534 --> 22:07.910
Better. Can you feel it?

22:09.245 --> 22:10.701
So what do you think?

22:10.830 --> 22:13.287
I can work with him if he's willing to work.

22:14.876 --> 22:17.162
Antoine, for you...40.

22:17.295 --> 22:18.831
30.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.374
45.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.174
Two lessons in advance.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.092
— Thanks, Mr. Batiste.
— Mm—hm.

22:30.225 --> 22:33.763
Y'all playing anywhere this week?
I'm-a come see you if I can.

22:36.981 --> 22:40.269
Me and my boy Denard,
we wanna start our own band, like y'all.

22:40.401 --> 22:43.188
— Yeah? Who the band leader?
- Me.

22:43.321 --> 22:46.529
Boy...you don't know what you getting into.

22:46.658 --> 22:48.569
(Giggling)

22:48.701 --> 22:51.989
Bad.Bad.Bad.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.279
— It was bad?
- No.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.202
You were good.

22:57.335 --> 22:58.791
We were good.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.332
It was good, but this is bad.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.754
It's the first rule.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.508
Do not fuck the floor.

23:07.637 --> 23:10.299
No, the first, first rule...

23:10.431 --> 23:13.423
Never ever fuck your sous—chef.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.642
| work for Susan now.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.101
Ripert said it —

23:17.230 --> 23:22.224
friends and lovers come and go,
but your sous—chef is for life.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.525
For life.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.570
But this...
If I have a restaurant again...

23:29.284 --> 23:32.401
I mean, ljust fucked myself here,
you know?

23:34.163 --> 23:36.154
I will cook for you.

23:36.291 --> 23:40.079
No, this messes everything... OK.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.997
It's a one—off.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.591
| go back to New York and that's it.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.542
And if we work together again —

23:48.678 --> 23:50.543
and I know we will —

23:50.680 --> 23:53.513
then you promise to act
like this never happened.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.177
Vraiment?

23:55.310 --> 23:57.050
Oui. Vraiment.

24:01.065 --> 24:02.601
(Buzzer)

24:13.119 --> 24:16.987
— Your Honor.
— Toni, you look great.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.363
Come here.

24:18.499 --> 24:21.662
— Great to see you.
- Sit down. Sit, sit.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.958
l was sorry to hear about Cray.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.342
Yeah. How are they treating you?

24:28.468 --> 24:32.461
Oh, what does it matter?
l'm busting out of this place night after next.

24:32.597 --> 24:35.509
This tinhorn joint can't hold me, see?

24:36.559 --> 24:40.598
We better get started. They're only
gonna give us about an hour or so.

24:40.730 --> 24:44.564
That's all I got on the one,
and this is what I have on the other.

25:09.467 --> 25:12.709
Son...you take care
of my business so well...

25:13.638 --> 25:15.879
I sometimes forget you exist.

25:16.766 --> 25:20.429
— What's left on the current contract?
— Not more than a day.

25:20.561 --> 25:21.812
That's why I called.

25:21.938 --> 25:24.350
— There's a problem.
- Say what?

25:24.482 --> 25:26.689
I called P&J in Florida about the re—up.

25:26.818 --> 25:29.525
Eighth time,
and I'm not expecting anything

25:29.654 --> 25:31.235
— but more of the same.
- And?

25:31.364 --> 25:34.902
They say we ain't on the list
of approved contractors no more.

25:36.786 --> 25:39.823
— Who you piss off, boss man?
— Nobody.

25:40.957 --> 25:42.948
I love everybody.
Everybody loves me.

25:43.084 --> 25:46.292
What the fuck?
l'll sort it out. Don't worry.

25:50.466 --> 25:55.005
I don't worry. Worrying's above
my motherfucking pay grade.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.795
(Buzzer)

26:02.145 --> 26:03.510
They're not gonna hand you the file.

26:03.646 --> 26:06.638
— Get that thought out of your mind.
- Course not.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.482
I'm thinking you call the federales.

26:10.611 --> 26:12.863
DOJ is not gonna do shit about this.

26:12.989 --> 26:15.605
- Oh, yeah.
— Republican White House.

26:15.742 --> 26:20.736
There isn't a US Attorney in the country
who'll bring a civil rights case to save his life.

26:20.872 --> 26:24.114
Have you read the papers?
They're firing everyone who won't toe the line.

26:24.250 --> 26:28.664
That's true enough, but I think
if you got the right FBI agent interested,

26:28.796 --> 26:30.661
I think somebody'd do the legwork here.

26:30.798 --> 26:36.418
On the premise that Hillary or somebody
wins next year and changes the game.

26:36.554 --> 26:39.045
Try Collington, Squad 6.

26:39.182 --> 26:41.548
Of course, he's probably up to his ass
in Morial stuff.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.640
It seems all the Feds
give a shit about these days

26:43.770 --> 26:45.226
is running down Morial and his people.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.481
— Sti||?
— Yeah. Yeah.

26:47.607 --> 26:50.849
— Hey, did you hear they got Pampy Barre?
—Mmm.

26:52.695 --> 26:55.232
- They flipped his ass.
— Where did you hear that?

26:55.364 --> 26:57.650
What do you mean?
Prison grapevine, darling.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.651
Come on. The Feds were down here
talking to some guys,

27:00.787 --> 27:03.904
trying to firm up some of the stuff
Pampy had given up.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.953
- Like what?
— Oh, Oliver Thomas for one.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.289
- Oliver? No way.
— What do you mean, no way?

27:11.422 --> 27:14.880
We're talking about the same Oliver Thomas
who came up under Singleton's machine.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.215
Oliver's not Singleton,

27:16.344 --> 27:18.835
and ever since the storm
he has been a voice for this city.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.804
— He's a good man.
— Yeah, well, we're all good men.

27:21.933 --> 27:23.673
We all love our mamas.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.641
We all root for the Saints.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.887
Last time I checked, Toni,
this is still Louisiana.

27:29.607 --> 27:31.347
Oliver likes the ponies, I hear.

27:31.484 --> 27:34.601
What does a councilman make?
What, 40 thou a year?

27:34.737 --> 27:39.902
And Oliver - he isn't rich to begin with,
like some of them on the council, right?

27:41.369 --> 27:43.735
I can see you think well of the guy.

27:43.871 --> 27:48.661
But, Toni, you haven't always been
a great judge of character.

27:48.793 --> 27:50.749
(Both laugh)

27:51.838 --> 27:54.170
Yeah, yeah. OK.

27:54.298 --> 27:56.334
— Good luck with the case.
— Thank you.

27:56.467 --> 28:00.210
— Come see me again sometime.
- You bet. Thank you.

28:02.431 --> 28:04.467
(Buzzer)

28:04.892 --> 28:05.972
(Phone ringing)

28:06.102 --> 28:08.468
(Man) Homicide. How can I help you?

28:42.889 --> 28:46.507
But the record don't come out
till next fall, right?

28:46.642 --> 28:48.974
Advance orders on this, crazy good.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.932
Advanced orders?

28:52.982 --> 28:54.222
From where?

28:54.358 --> 28:56.735
Sweden, Switzerland...

28:56.861 --> 28:58.817
Brazil, Japan.

29:01.115 --> 29:02.480
Japan loves jazz.

29:02.617 --> 29:05.734
And New Orleans stuff...
since the storm...

29:07.330 --> 29:09.867
$20,000?

29:12.960 --> 29:15.076
Whew. You get one of these too?

29:15.212 --> 29:19.251
Yeah, and Don, Mac and them
already been paid for the session.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.843
We gotta out another record.

29:27.975 --> 29:29.511
Um, yeah.

29:33.356 --> 29:37.190
— You ever catch that witness at home?
- I'll get to it, Lieutenant.

29:37.318 --> 29:38.273
VVhen?

29:38.402 --> 29:41.485
Don't worry, LT. You're covered.

29:42.156 --> 29:45.239
— Fine. Luis.
— Hey, Lieutenant.

29:50.915 --> 29:53.406
Something interesting
in a couple of cases, Captain.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.578
Possible break in the Abreu thing.

29:57.171 --> 29:58.707
Abreu?

29:59.757 --> 30:03.249
- Refresh my memory.
— Kid found shot inside Robideaux's.

30:03.386 --> 30:05.377
One in the head, close range.

30:05.513 --> 30:06.878
What about it?

30:07.014 --> 30:09.847
Well, I got a tip from a Legal Aid lawyer that...

30:09.976 --> 30:14.345
it might be connected to another shooting
in the lberville projects.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.938
Same week after the storm,
maybe the same day.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.308
Second vic is Leon Seals.

30:20.444 --> 30:23.060
— A Legal Aid lawyer?
— Yeah, cold—called me a week ago.

30:23.197 --> 30:24.607
Can I?

30:24.740 --> 30:28.198
Yeah, so I'm... I'm working the...
working the ballistics,

30:28.327 --> 30:29.612
and it shouldn't matter,

30:29.745 --> 30:33.283
because the Abreu casings
recovered by the first officer went missing.

30:33.416 --> 30:34.576
So?

30:34.709 --> 30:37.416
It turns out that the detectives
working the cases,

30:37.545 --> 30:40.036
they never went out to Saint Gabriel
to recover evidence.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.834
The shit's just sitting there, all bagged up.

30:42.967 --> 30:45.128
Until DMORT closes
and they send it all back

30:45.261 --> 30:47.001
to Temporary Evidence,
so I went over to see.

30:47.138 --> 30:48.753
— You did, huh?
- Yeah.

30:48.889 --> 30:52.347
And it turns out that we got
a good bullet out of the Abreu kid

30:52.476 --> 30:54.888
but a mutilated slug from Seals,

30:55.021 --> 30:57.683
so...there's no comparison there.

30:57.815 --> 30:59.305
But casings...

31:00.651 --> 31:02.983
We got casings from both the shootings.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.693
You just said the casings from Abreu
went missing.

31:07.825 --> 31:09.315
The ones from the scene did,

31:09.452 --> 31:12.285
but when the morgue guys
went through the kid's bloody clothes,

31:12.413 --> 31:14.449
they found...

31:14.582 --> 31:16.413
this right here...

31:18.294 --> 31:19.784
..in one of the pants cuffs.

31:23.007 --> 31:25.339
It's a clean .380 shell.

31:25.468 --> 31:27.504
And guess what? That Legal Aid guy?

31:27.636 --> 31:30.628
He goes to the Seals scene,
with a witness,

31:30.765 --> 31:33.256
and he recovers...this.

31:36.187 --> 31:39.350
It's amazing how anyone working
that crime scene would miss it, right?

31:39.482 --> 31:42.690
— A Legal Aid lawyer recovered those?
- Yeah.

31:42.818 --> 31:43.978
Fuck it.

31:44.111 --> 31:45.942
No clean chain of custody.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.858
Well, the lawyers can argue about it, sure,

31:48.991 --> 31:51.403
but for right now...

31:51.535 --> 31:54.072
we've got good casings from both scenes.

31:54.205 --> 31:56.446
So I'm gonna send 'em over for comparison.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.163
I mean, if the casings are the same,

31:58.292 --> 32:01.955
then we should be proceeding
as if the cases are linked, right?

32:03.214 --> 32:05.205
Gives us something to go on, anyway.

32:11.180 --> 32:12.636
That's good work, Lieutenant.

32:12.765 --> 32:15.507
No, it's shit that should
have been done months ago,

32:15.643 --> 32:17.679
but neither of those cases got worked at all.

32:17.812 --> 32:22.021
Yeah, well, the stuff right after the storm...
kinda got dumped.

32:22.149 --> 32:23.855
Now, too many new cases.

32:29.198 --> 32:32.440
Oh, yeah, that, um...
that Legal Aid guy,

32:32.576 --> 32:36.489
he says that he has witnesses
putting police at both the scenes.

32:36.622 --> 32:37.828
— Police?
— Yeah.

32:37.957 --> 32:40.494
He's saying the witnesses
are lDing cops as the shooters.

32:40.626 --> 32:43.663
Not that anyone's
coming fonNard on it or anything, but...

32:43.796 --> 32:46.503
It's probably bullshit, I know.

33:05.401 --> 33:06.766
(J‘ Punk playing)

33:06.902 --> 33:08.017
Hey.

33:09.822 --> 33:12.108
— Oh! Hi, buddy.
- Hi.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.903
— Mm, how was it?
- It was OK.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.696
Rough flight coming back, though.

33:16.829 --> 33:19.741
It felt like we fell onto La Guardia
more than we landed.

33:19.874 --> 33:22.456
- What's up, gator?
— Hey, Chef. Thanks for the day.

33:22.585 --> 33:27.249
- No worries. Your friend, he's OK?
— My sous—chef? Yup, he's out ofjail.

33:27.381 --> 33:29.337
They lock up sous—chefs down there?

33:29.466 --> 33:32.629
It's a tough town. Saucier gets in trouble,
they shoot him on the spot.

33:32.761 --> 33:36.299
As they should,
what with their saucy, fake personalities

33:36.432 --> 33:38.764
and their buttery, unctuous way of talking.

33:38.893 --> 33:42.351
— They're an untrustworthy bunch...
- Hey, dickface, shut it.

33:42.479 --> 33:45.812
Donald Link called me after he came in
for your last Southern night.

33:45.941 --> 33:47.932
- Yeah?
— He seems to think you can cook.

33:50.487 --> 33:52.193
I can cook.

33:52.323 --> 33:54.188
(Chuckles) Did you hear that, Nicky?

33:54.325 --> 33:55.781
- (Splash)
— I can... Oh, shit!

33:55.910 --> 33:58.777
(Men chatting in Vietnamese)

34:06.795 --> 34:08.877
All right, young boy, come help me.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.665
Come help me, come help me.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.010
Go, go, go!

34:18.140 --> 34:20.347
You need to pull, pull harder!

34:20.476 --> 34:22.091
Pull harder. Go!

34:38.327 --> 34:41.865
(Shouting in Vietnamese)

34:41.997 --> 34:44.579
Two hands, v6 dung.

34:44.708 --> 34:49.919
Two hands, like me.
If you work like that, you're v6 dung, man.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.537
— V6 dung?
- Yeah.

34:51.674 --> 34:53.005
Yeah, that's me, right?

34:53.133 --> 34:54.088
Yeah.

34:54.218 --> 34:57.051
—Vo dung.
—Vo dung...

34:58.847 --> 35:02.214
Mr. Tran...
what does "v6 dung" mean?

35:02.851 --> 35:03.977
Useless.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.343
(Laughs)

35:07.815 --> 35:09.555
V6 dung, v6 dung, v6 dung!

35:13.070 --> 35:15.277
(J‘ Guardians Coming Through playing)

35:29.712 --> 35:32.203
- (Song ends)
— Wow. You got something there.

35:32.339 --> 35:34.375
- Hell, yes.
— (Don) That will stand.

35:34.508 --> 35:36.544
That will stand up most definitely.

35:36.677 --> 35:39.669
- Congratulations, man.
— I couldn't have done it without you, man.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.888
I'm thinking I'd like to run some of these charts

35:43.017 --> 35:45.929
— past my guys and play 'em for Jazz Fest.
- Yeah?

35:46.061 --> 35:50.179
Yeah, and bring you and your father up
and we could share the set together.

35:50.316 --> 35:52.477
— We're doing the first Friday.
— Yeah.

35:52.609 --> 35:55.772
But I gotta run back to New York,
handle some things. What time's the set?

35:55.904 --> 35:59.692
— 3:15 at the Jazz Tent.
— That'll work. I'll be back before then.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.406
One love.

36:02.703 --> 36:03.692
Yes!

36:03.829 --> 36:06.115
(J‘ Jazz playing)

36:09.543 --> 36:11.204
(Gasps)

36:15.924 --> 36:17.380
(Moans)

36:23.057 --> 36:26.891
— l'm dreaming...again.
- I know.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.885
I know.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.818
I'm scared of my fucking dreams.

36:43.827 --> 36:47.570
I know. I know.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.247
(Phone ringing)

36:51.877 --> 36:53.378
(Woman) Homicide.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.453
(Ringing tone)

36:56.590 --> 36:58.581
— (Woman over phone) Crime lab.
- Ballistics, please.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.332
l'll transfer you.

37:00.928 --> 37:04.091
- (Man) Ballistics.
— Hey, this is Lieutenant Colson over at NOPD.

37:04.223 --> 37:08.512
I'm wondering if you got
to that priority comparison yet today.

37:08.644 --> 37:10.009
I sent it yesterday.

37:10.145 --> 37:12.306
(Man) Comparison?
You only sent one over.

37:12.439 --> 37:15.977
No, there were definitely two submissions.
Both bagged, one casing in each.

37:16.110 --> 37:19.022
(Man) I assumed you made
some sort of mistake.

37:19.154 --> 37:22.612
All right. I'll look into it on my end.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.242
(Man) Sure you didn't...?

37:24.368 --> 37:26.029
No. OK.

37:44.263 --> 37:47.676
Called my guy in Baton Rouge.
He gives me the bad news.

37:47.808 --> 37:50.720
Tells me I'm cutoff,
tells me I should see my friend.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.387
I would have called you,
but I don't want to use your phone.

37:54.523 --> 37:56.730
My phone?

37:56.859 --> 38:00.772
A fella named Pampy Barre
got indicted federally last year. He's flipped.

38:00.904 --> 38:03.611
Word is he's flipped on Thomas.

38:03.740 --> 38:04.900
Oh, Jesus.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.695
Something to do with a contract
on a downtown parking lot.

38:07.828 --> 38:10.160
Sounds like penny—ante shit, but who knows?

38:10.289 --> 38:13.122
In any event, I know you and Oliver
had done some business.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.616
— Well, just...
— I don't want to know,

38:15.752 --> 38:19.040
but what I'm telling you now
is that we're gonna have to take you

38:19.173 --> 38:20.834
and your chips off the table for a while.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.048
Demo contracts, mid—city real estate —

38:23.177 --> 38:25.259
I'm gonna shift that to other people for a while

38:25.387 --> 38:27.548
— until we see where all this is going.
— Even if...

38:27.681 --> 38:30.969
Nelson, your value to me
on the real-estate side

38:31.101 --> 38:33.683
was your anonymity in this town.

38:34.855 --> 38:37.016
If your name comes up
in a federal investigation,

38:37.149 --> 38:39.310
that's no longer the case.

38:39.443 --> 38:41.900
So be patient on this, please.

38:42.029 --> 38:44.270
I need you to back away
from the table for a while.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.648
lf Thomas walks up to you
wanting to talk,

38:47.784 --> 38:50.912
remember he could be a walking microphone,
you understand?

38:53.916 --> 38:56.248
We need to talk about anything,
l'll reach out.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.835
OthenNise, this could be
a good time for you to go home,

39:00.964 --> 39:05.253
— see family and friends back in Dallas.
— (Ship's horn sounding)

39:05.385 --> 39:07.296
(J‘ Jazz playing)

39:25.864 --> 39:27.274
I got out of prison, bro.

39:27.407 --> 39:30.240
Now today, back to the money.
I gotta do what I gotta do.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.075
I had to come up, bro.

39:33.497 --> 39:35.783
You know what I'm saying?

39:45.801 --> 39:47.917
- Hey.
— Hey, you.

39:48.929 --> 39:51.341
- Ernest here?
— Should be by later.

39:51.473 --> 39:53.464
Can I help you?

39:56.478 --> 39:58.685
OK, I'm gonna leave this list with you.

40:00.649 --> 40:04.562
Refrigerator, beer cooler, jukebox, register.

40:04.695 --> 40:06.686
Good prices on all of 'em.

40:12.452 --> 40:14.909
I'm asking best—price offer, OK?

40:15.038 --> 40:16.824
I'll let him know.

40:17.874 --> 40:20.001
(Men laughing)

40:20.127 --> 40:24.712
(Man) I'm telling you. I don't know...
I don't know what it is.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.626
We need to try to come up off of somethin'.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.716
You know what I'm saying? It's crazy, brah.

40:29.845 --> 40:32.211
(Man laughs)

40:38.645 --> 40:42.103
l'm hurting, lil' bro. I'm telling you.
I'm telling you.

40:58.707 --> 41:00.993
(Woman over phone)
Operator 205, what is your report?

41:01.126 --> 41:04.118
- Yes, emergency.
— Which department?

41:04.254 --> 41:07.712
Police. I need the god damn police,
right away.

41:07.841 --> 41:10.173
— So how'd you find me?
— Donald Link.

41:10.302 --> 41:12.918
So he really is singing my praises, huh?

41:13.055 --> 41:16.297
Can't stop talking about what you're doing
with Chang's Southern cooking night.

41:16.433 --> 41:18.549
He is not the only one.

41:19.353 --> 41:21.560
So...what do you think?

41:21.688 --> 41:24.930
What do I think?
I think it's a lot to think about.

41:25.067 --> 41:29.106
Yeah. I'm talking about giving you
a fat salary — week in, week out —

41:29.237 --> 41:30.522
and 25% share of the place.

41:30.656 --> 41:33.523
I know you've had your own restaurant,
you're used to being the boss,

41:33.659 --> 41:35.991
but for all intents and purposes
this will be yours,

41:36.119 --> 41:40.237
with your name on the menu
under "executive chef," your crew.

41:40.374 --> 41:43.582
Equipment is a half—million—dollar build—out
on my part.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.826
And guess what? Link, Spicer, Besh —

41:45.962 --> 41:49.625
they're willing to back
an additional quarter—mil loan.

41:49.758 --> 41:54.468
If we start turning a profit,
they'll let you buy them out over time.

41:55.597 --> 41:57.713
We have friends who want you home.

41:59.393 --> 42:03.261
What about you? | get a chance
to buy you out if we turn the corner?

42:03.397 --> 42:05.604
I'm here for the money.

42:05.732 --> 42:08.690
So, no. We turn the corner,
I turn the corner with you.

42:08.819 --> 42:09.934
Oh, it's just...

42:12.155 --> 42:15.238
— I'm just hitting my stride here.
— Hitting your stride.

42:15.367 --> 42:18.825
- I'm happy at the Peach.
— Chef, you hit your stride.

42:18.954 --> 42:19.989
You're there.

42:20.122 --> 42:23.831
— Let me think about it.
- Well, think fast.

42:23.959 --> 42:28.453
There's a couple of properties in the CBD
that are up for auction.

42:28.588 --> 42:30.579
I'm going down tomorrow.
You should too.

42:30.716 --> 42:33.332
| just took time off.
| just got back from New Orleans.

42:33.468 --> 42:35.129
It's your call.

42:38.432 --> 42:41.845
God damn it, the man gon' roll out
if they don't fucking show up!

42:41.977 --> 42:44.969
(Woman over phone) I understand, ma'am.
The officers are on...

42:51.903 --> 42:55.691
The man who beat and raped me
is inside that bar.

42:55.824 --> 42:59.316
— He just sitting in there, pulling on a beer.
— Hold on. Raped you when?

42:59.453 --> 43:01.660
Five months ago.
He been locked up for it.

43:01.788 --> 43:04.700
He been locked up all this time,
God damn it.

43:04.833 --> 43:08.621
- So he's been charged?
— He been in jail! Both of 'em, they been in jail!

43:08.754 --> 43:10.710
— Maybe he made bail.
- Uh-uh. Ain't no bail.

43:10.839 --> 43:13.376
| just talked to the District Attorney yesterday.

43:13.508 --> 43:15.419
Now that boy supposed to be locked up,

43:15.552 --> 43:18.760
so go in there
and lock him the fuck up!

43:18.889 --> 43:22.381
He got a yellow and white T—shirt, yellow cap.

43:22.517 --> 43:25.350
He's sitting at that table by the window.

43:36.615 --> 43:38.731
(Bottles clanging)

43:38.867 --> 43:43.281
— (Man) Hey, stop. Stop.
— Fuck y'all, man. This is bullshit!

43:43.413 --> 43:44.823
Get down.

43:47.042 --> 43:49.533
— Stay down.
- Yeah.

43:49.669 --> 43:51.284
It's me.

43:53.298 --> 43:55.209
Hey!

43:55.342 --> 43:58.505
- Me!
— Whoa! You're both going to OPP

43:58.637 --> 44:02.676
— if you keep this shit up!
— It's me! Me, motherfucker! Me!

44:02.808 --> 44:04.298
It's me!

44:05.310 --> 44:06.390
Me!

44:06.520 --> 44:10.058
It's me! It's me!

44:12.567 --> 44:14.432
(Sobbing) It's me.

44:19.533 --> 44:21.615
(Pump whirring)

44:43.431 --> 44:47.344
- Oil from the rig.
— Was there a spill?

44:47.477 --> 44:49.513
No, no spill.

44:50.981 --> 44:52.437
But they leak slow.

44:52.566 --> 44:55.649
Slow leaks? All of them?

44:56.695 --> 44:57.901
Most.

44:59.030 --> 45:00.770
How many of these are out here?

45:00.907 --> 45:03.614
Pump stations? Some.

45:03.743 --> 45:05.279
Dead rigs?

45:06.329 --> 45:09.162
A thousand? Ten thousand?

45:09.291 --> 45:10.747
Crazy.

45:13.295 --> 45:15.911
People do what they want...

45:16.047 --> 45:18.163
take what they want...

45:19.509 --> 45:21.500
and then they move on.

45:37.193 --> 45:40.651
I guess you wanna dump those off at home
before we go to dinner.

45:40.780 --> 45:43.647
We can go back to your place,
grab a bite to eat in Brooklyn.

45:43.783 --> 45:47.275
You wanna lug those all the way out
to Brooklyn then back again?

45:47.412 --> 45:51.746
Uh, actually, I was kinda thinking you
could hold onto these for me for a while.

45:51.875 --> 45:53.911
You wanna bring
your turntables over too

45:54.044 --> 45:57.787
and school me on ancient African—American
music of the 20th century?

45:57.923 --> 46:02.417
Yeah, uh, my turntables
and all the rest of my shit.

46:03.637 --> 46:04.968
Say what?

46:05.096 --> 46:07.473
I decided I gotta give up my apartment.

46:07.599 --> 46:09.931
- Seriously?
— Yeah, I got to.

46:10.060 --> 46:13.518
I gotta go down to New Orleans for as long
as it's gonna take my father

46:13.647 --> 46:15.228
to get the house back together.

46:15.357 --> 46:18.394
I can't let him go on living
how he been living any longer.

46:18.526 --> 46:20.266
So you're moving back?

46:21.529 --> 46:24.771
No, just for a few months, probably.
I'll be in and out on gigs.

46:24.908 --> 46:29.402
So you want me to make a nice home for
your record collection and your winter clothes?

46:29.537 --> 46:33.280
— Is that the plan?
— No, it's not forever. It's just...

46:33.416 --> 46:37.705
I can't keep the apartment and give my father
enough money to rebuild the house.

46:37.837 --> 46:40.374
I gotta give it up, at least for a while.

46:40.507 --> 46:43.965
OK, | get that.
Your father needs your help.

46:44.094 --> 46:48.463
So why don't you just rent storage space,
like everybody else in New York?

46:48.598 --> 46:51.305
l was just trying to lower my overhead.
Forget | asked.

46:51.434 --> 46:56.724
Delmond, is this your passive—aggressive way
of asking to move in with me...

46:56.856 --> 47:00.895
in stages? Like, first your shit,
and then you every time you're in town?

47:01.027 --> 47:03.268
Cheaper and friendlier than a hotel,

47:03.405 --> 47:06.192
get laid, look at your records,
then "See you next month"?

47:06.324 --> 47:09.111
- No. It ain't like that.
— Because moving in together...

47:09.244 --> 47:13.613
that's a full—time,
one—man—one—woman type of moment,

47:13.748 --> 47:16.740
and you're not exactly
having that moment, are you?

47:20.130 --> 47:21.336
Jill...

47:22.966 --> 47:25.207
I'm out.

47:32.392 --> 47:34.053
(Oliver) You need a ride?

47:34.185 --> 47:35.925
No, my mom's picking me up.

47:46.906 --> 47:48.737
Are you all right?

47:51.911 --> 47:53.742
It's bad, isn't it?

47:55.749 --> 47:57.159
What?

48:00.879 --> 48:04.087
- What have you heard?
— My mom heard something.

48:05.383 --> 48:07.339
It gets around, huh?

48:10.597 --> 48:13.304
Why? Why did you...

48:13.433 --> 48:15.719
I can't really say.

48:15.852 --> 48:18.013
I don't think I've figured it out.

48:19.939 --> 48:22.897
But what I do know is,
everything we do counts.

48:23.693 --> 48:25.934
Everything. It all plays out.

48:26.946 --> 48:28.322
(Horn beeps)

48:31.451 --> 48:33.191
Hey, look, your mom's here.

48:35.371 --> 48:36.577
Tell her hi for me.

48:55.391 --> 48:59.430
For me to walk into a god damn bar
five blocks from my own

48:59.562 --> 49:02.804
and see this motherfucker sitting there
drinking a Heineken?

49:02.941 --> 49:04.477
Like any other person?

49:04.609 --> 49:06.645
There was a clerical mistake, Mrs. Williams.

49:06.778 --> 49:08.939
When we dropped the charges
on the other case,

49:09.072 --> 49:11.905
the jail failed to note the detainer
for your charges as well.

49:12.033 --> 49:14.615
The fuck is wrong with you people?

49:14.744 --> 49:17.952
You lose my brother
in the damn jail for months...

49:18.081 --> 49:23.997
and then you let this vicious little
motherfucker go, the first chance you get.

49:25.213 --> 49:27.078
We trying to live in this city.

49:27.215 --> 49:29.547
We trying to come back here,

49:29.676 --> 49:33.635
put what little shit we got
back together and live.

49:33.763 --> 49:36.926
And all y'all manage to bring to that is nothing.

49:38.309 --> 49:40.721
Rebuild a house? Hell, no.

49:40.854 --> 49:42.890
"Fill out these forms and wait."

49:43.022 --> 49:44.978
Get your child back in school? Which one?

49:45.108 --> 49:46.894
You got three different school systems.

49:47.026 --> 49:50.268
Two of 'em ain't teaching shit
and the third one can only hold but so many.

49:50.405 --> 49:53.192
Open the hospital back up? Hell no.

49:53.324 --> 49:56.191
Let's tear down some more
neighborhoods instead.

49:56.327 --> 49:58.443
Solve a crime or two?

49:58.580 --> 50:00.866
Oh, hell the fuck no!

50:02.458 --> 50:04.414
I don't blame you for being upset.

50:05.336 --> 50:06.416
U pset?

50:06.546 --> 50:08.411
Bitch, I'm past upset.

50:08.548 --> 50:11.460
I'm all the way to lost—my—fucking—mind.

50:20.852 --> 50:24.515
I'll tell you one thing —
we ain't selling that damn bar.

50:25.690 --> 50:28.306
Look at you.
This is who I married.

50:28.443 --> 50:30.900
You went away. Now you back.

50:31.029 --> 50:34.897
The hell are you talking about, Larry?
You hate the bar. You always did.

50:35.033 --> 50:38.366
Hate it to death.
But we ain't selling it.

50:38.494 --> 50:43.113
And we ain't staying in Baton Rouge, neither.
We coming home - all of us.

50:44.042 --> 50:47.785
You ain't gonna be who you are othenNise.
| see it now.

50:53.218 --> 50:54.628
Come on, baby.

51:08.858 --> 51:14.069
Davis, you yourself said
he was a better guitarist.

51:14.197 --> 51:16.279
— He is, definitely.
— Mm.

51:17.033 --> 51:20.946
But you're still singing or rapping
or whatever it is you do.

51:24.249 --> 51:30.165
Well, I can see there is nothing I can say
to crash your pity party, but...

51:30.964 --> 51:33.376
(Chuckles)

51:33.508 --> 51:36.170
— ..this is for you.
— What's this?

51:36.302 --> 51:38.964
Oh...it's just half the proceeds

51:39.097 --> 51:43.340
from selling Lil Calliope's contract
to this other local label...

51:43.476 --> 51:45.387
Cash something.

51:46.145 --> 51:47.521
Cash Mon...

51:47.647 --> 51:53.768
You... You sold Calliope's contract to
Cash Money for eight thousand, 45...

51:53.903 --> 51:56.861
Of course not! I sold it for $30,000,

51:56.990 --> 52:01.575
which means I am already in the black
from this wonderful little adventure of yours,

52:01.703 --> 52:04.536
and we hadn't even
released the sampler yet.

52:04.664 --> 52:07.280
Whoo! I love the music business.

52:07.417 --> 52:09.328
— (Davis) Um...
- Mmm.

52:09.460 --> 52:13.419
OK. If you sold that for 30,000,

52:13.548 --> 52:19.544
— then why is mine $4,267.95?
- Davis...

52:19.679 --> 52:23.843
you are aware that you have
been charging a variety of expenses

52:23.975 --> 52:26.466
to my credit card
for the last several months?

52:26.602 --> 52:31.392
- Honey, it goes without saying...
— Never mind, I... Never mind, I got it.

52:32.692 --> 52:36.810
— So, Calliope, my band...
- Mm-mm. Not the band.

52:36.946 --> 52:39.437
They just wanted the contract on Calliope.

52:44.495 --> 52:47.157
Honey, don't look so glum.

52:48.249 --> 52:52.117
You just make yourself a new band.
That's easy for you.

52:52.253 --> 52:56.121
Listen here, you do what you do again,
I'll do what I do,

52:56.257 --> 52:59.670
and everything will be
peaches and cream, won't it?

52:59.802 --> 53:01.633
Again, please.

53:21.074 --> 53:24.487
So what's so secret you won't
even come to the field office?

53:24.619 --> 53:26.985
They still make you sign in
at the front desk, right?

53:27.121 --> 53:29.612
Or is the FBI doing away with the formalities?

53:29.749 --> 53:31.159
That bad?

53:37.131 --> 53:40.669
That's everything we have
on the Danziger shooting.

53:40.802 --> 53:44.294
You might as well start saving string
for when Eddie screws up the state case.

53:44.430 --> 53:48.014
Also this kid Abreu from First District, and...

53:48.976 --> 53:50.432
another one — Seals.

53:52.146 --> 53:53.647
Couple more as well.

53:57.527 --> 53:59.734
— And?
— All of it's been dumped.

54:00.863 --> 54:02.399
Every case.

54:03.408 --> 54:06.900
Witnesses blocked, evidence missing,

54:07.036 --> 54:10.244
no follow—up, no real investigative response.

54:10.373 --> 54:14.992
And all of them, I'm beginning to believe,
are police-involved.

54:15.128 --> 54:18.416
— In your opinion.
— Let me tell you what I just did.

54:18.548 --> 54:21.290
I fucking lied to my captain.

54:21.426 --> 54:26.420
I told him that I had spent casings that could
link two of those cases - Abreu and Seals.

54:26.556 --> 54:30.014
I told him that I had a witness
saying that the shooters were police.

54:30.143 --> 54:31.679
And you know what happened?

54:32.895 --> 54:35.181
They lost one of the casings.

54:35.314 --> 54:37.851
They lost it on the way over
to Jeff Parish ballistics lab.

54:37.984 --> 54:39.690
— What do you mean?
— It didn't get there.

54:39.819 --> 54:42.526
They disappeared the motherfucker.

54:43.948 --> 54:47.861
The funny thing is, it wasn't from Abreu.
I lied to him.

54:47.994 --> 54:50.235
Both casings were from Seals,

54:50.371 --> 54:54.705
but they thought I was going somewhere with it
and so they disappeared the shit.

54:54.834 --> 54:58.201
Like they've been doing all along,
the motherfuckers.

55:00.381 --> 55:03.168
Jimmy...you guys gotta come in...

55:04.427 --> 55:06.418
and clean house.

55:09.891 --> 55:11.472
I'll do what I can.

55:13.352 --> 55:14.341
(Engine starts)

55:14.479 --> 55:16.561
(J‘ Slowjazz)

55:19.275 --> 55:21.140
What the fuck?

55:21.277 --> 55:23.359
I come to town...

55:23.488 --> 55:25.069
make friends...

55:25.198 --> 55:27.405
I've got a kind word for everybody...

55:27.533 --> 55:30.991
doing what I do, making what I can,
getting it done.

55:32.330 --> 55:35.242
And now, cuz, I could go to fucking jail.

55:35.374 --> 55:37.285
What? Why?

55:38.294 --> 55:39.784
Don't you get it?

55:41.047 --> 55:44.210
The Feds rolled somebody up
on Oliver Thomas —

55:44.342 --> 55:47.004
the council guy I was working with.

55:47.136 --> 55:48.842
Now, Thomas, he could roll me up.

55:48.971 --> 55:51.462
- For what?
— For bullshit.

55:52.558 --> 55:56.471
I threw the guy a little cash.
For the cable thing, remember?

55:56.604 --> 55:58.595
I did right by him.

56:01.651 --> 56:03.107
That how you do it in Dallas?

56:04.904 --> 56:07.520
Everywhere, cuz. Everywhere.

56:09.575 --> 56:12.282
Nelson, man, let me ask you something...

56:12.411 --> 56:13.617
what do you do?

56:15.540 --> 56:18.532
What do I do? What do you mean?

56:18.668 --> 56:20.374
What is it that you do?

56:23.839 --> 56:25.670
I do deals. | make money.

56:25.800 --> 56:28.007
But what do you make?
What is it that you do?

56:28.928 --> 56:31.510
When I'm a bouncer,
I'm making sure the club gets paid its cover,

56:31.639 --> 56:34.756
I'm keeping the drunks from grabbing the girls
or fighting each other.

56:34.892 --> 56:37.133
And when I'm up on a house,
I'm putting on a roof.

56:37.270 --> 56:39.636
I do a deal, something gets done.

56:39.772 --> 56:41.387
Like what?

56:42.608 --> 56:44.564
This real—estate thing...

56:44.694 --> 56:49.654
I'll let you in on a secret -
they're gonna build a new hospital there.

56:49.782 --> 56:52.398
That's why we're buying up the houses.

56:52.535 --> 56:56.949
Cuz, everyone I talk to says there's
a hospital already they won't reopen.

56:57.081 --> 56:59.322
OK. Well, this'll be a new hospital.

56:59.458 --> 57:02.325
— A better hospital, maybe.
— But you ain't gonna build it.

57:02.461 --> 57:05.453
You bought land to sell land
to make money before they build it,

57:05.590 --> 57:07.455
just like you didn't do no hauling.

57:07.592 --> 57:09.173
— So?
— So I put a roof up,

57:09.302 --> 57:12.214
it won't rain in some
poor motherfucker's house.

57:14.765 --> 57:16.380
I gotta go.

57:24.859 --> 57:26.941
(I Rock music playing)

57:30.573 --> 57:32.859
— Hey, Chef?
— Yes?

57:32.992 --> 57:34.573
I can't believe I gotta ask,

57:34.702 --> 57:37.535
but I need to go back to New Orleans
for a couple of days.

57:37.663 --> 57:41.201
- Back to New Orleans?
— I know. I'm an asshole.

57:41.334 --> 57:45.122
If you're doing this to help out your sous—chef,
you're doing what you need to do.

57:45.254 --> 57:48.087
On the other hand, if you're going
because there's some dudes

57:48.215 --> 57:51.207
trying to poach you from my kitchen
to help you set up your own shop,

57:51.344 --> 57:52.584
then yes, you're an asshole.

57:52.720 --> 57:54.802
- You've heard.
— It's a small world, Chef.

57:54.930 --> 57:58.297
I don't know that I'm gonna jump, I really don't.
I'm happy here.

57:58.434 --> 58:01.676
— In your kitchen, I am. I'm happy.
— But homesick.

58:02.521 --> 58:06.264
That too. Look, this guy
wants to show me a couple of locations.

58:06.400 --> 58:08.436
He says they're not
gonna stay on the market long,

58:08.569 --> 58:11.732
but I don't know what I wanna do.
I really don't.

58:11.864 --> 58:15.231
Well, if you go home, go with God.

58:15.368 --> 58:17.154
I'm sure you'll knock 'em dead.

58:17.286 --> 58:19.402
But if you're gonna stay here,

58:19.538 --> 58:21.449
be happy with your work.

58:22.333 --> 58:24.574
Either way, I'm holding on to that chicken dish.

58:24.710 --> 58:26.826
— Cheers.
— It's yours.

58:26.962 --> 58:28.793
(J‘ Band playing)

58:28.923 --> 58:31.209
— J‘ Well, now, ferryman
— J‘ Oh, ferryman

58:31.342 --> 58:33.628
— J‘ Oh, ferryman
— J‘ Oh, ferryman

58:33.761 --> 58:36.298
J‘ Take me across the way tonight

58:36.972 --> 58:40.510
J‘ Those golden fields
are calling out to me

58:41.352 --> 58:44.014
J‘ A shore along the beach of night

58:44.146 --> 58:46.523
— J‘ Yes, now, ferryman
- J‘ Oh, ferryman

58:46.649 --> 58:48.765
— J‘ Oh, ferryman
— J‘ Oh, ferryman

58:48.901 --> 58:52.189
J‘ Won't you please take my fee?

58:52.321 --> 58:56.030
J‘ l've kissed a coin for heaven
and a coin for me

58:56.158 --> 58:59.742
J‘ Oh, ferryman, set me free

59:30.276 --> 59:31.891
(Laughs)

59:32.027 --> 59:33.563
Who is that in the Blues Tent?

59:33.696 --> 59:36.062
I'm gonna say Deacon John and his band.

59:37.450 --> 59:39.315
Ding! Correct answer.

59:39.452 --> 59:43.320
Let's catch that first and then Subdudes.
I wanna watch their set.

59:43.456 --> 59:46.698
Subdudes till half past two,
then I wanna go over to the Jazz Tent

59:46.834 --> 59:50.668
and catch the Guardians doing whatever
they're doing with Donald Harrison.

59:50.796 --> 59:53.082
Supposedly they're working on a CD together.

59:53.215 --> 59:55.467
— All right, cool.
— Oh, fuck!

59:55.593 --> 59:58.380
—What?
— I... Can we...

59:58.512 --> 1:00:01.879
— | forgot something. Can we go back?
- No, no way.

1:00:02.016 --> 1:00:05.679
- Oh, fuck.
— Davis, no, no, no, no, no.

1:00:07.688 --> 1:00:12.398
You didn't remember your weed
because you already smoked some of it today.

1:00:12.526 --> 1:00:15.108
It's almost poetic. Come on.

1:00:15.237 --> 1:00:17.023
I'm going to Jazz Fest weedless?

1:00:17.156 --> 1:00:19.693
— You're gonna be OK.
— It's gonna be weird.

1:00:19.825 --> 1:00:22.362
- (She laughs)
— I don't know if I can do this.

1:00:24.038 --> 1:00:26.700
- Shorty! Brah!
— Batiste, my man.

1:00:26.832 --> 1:00:27.821
What's going on?

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.869
— How you doing, darling?
- Hey, Troy.

1:00:30.002 --> 1:00:32.789
— Looks like we got a little drummer here.
- You think?

1:00:32.922 --> 1:00:35.914
Look at her go.
Everything on the one, like a little Willie Green.

1:00:36.050 --> 1:00:39.508
l was hoping for piano, actually,
have her learn that theory first.

1:00:39.637 --> 1:00:43.425
Piano's always on time,
especially if she wanna do a little composing.

1:00:43.557 --> 1:00:45.934
- You playing today?
— No, tomorrow, at Jazz Tent.

1:00:46.060 --> 1:00:48.642
— I'm just out enjoying the day.
- Cool. What else you up to?

1:00:48.771 --> 1:00:51.433
Nothing much.
Catch a little taste of home before I roll out.

1:00:51.565 --> 1:00:52.771
— Roll out where?
- Japan.

1:00:52.900 --> 1:00:57.360
Henry Butler needed a bone player,
plus I ain't never been to Japan, so you know.

1:00:57.488 --> 1:00:59.274
Henry Butler, huh?

1:00:59.406 --> 1:01:02.068
You playing anywhere this week, Antoine?

1:01:02.201 --> 1:01:04.317
Man...this week? No.

1:01:04.453 --> 1:01:07.786
Well, y'all enjoy Jazz Fest.
Have a good time.

1:01:07.915 --> 1:01:08.995
All right.

1:01:11.585 --> 1:01:14.827
— Henry Butler, huh?
- Japan Japan?

1:01:14.964 --> 1:01:19.754
Needless to say, given the open investigation
exclusion in the Public Records law,

1:01:19.885 --> 1:01:22.797
I can't go much further,
but...you all can.

1:01:23.681 --> 1:01:26.423
(Man) Thank you
for bringing this to our attention.

1:01:26.559 --> 1:01:29.471
We will certainly review your allegations.

1:01:29.603 --> 1:01:31.980
And the witness you interviewed,

1:01:32.106 --> 1:01:35.314
is he willing to be identified,
go to grand jury on it?

1:01:35.442 --> 1:01:38.104
If it's clear you guys are bringing
a real investigation,

1:01:38.237 --> 1:01:42.105
and you can ensure his safety,
I think he will come fonNard, yes.

1:01:43.576 --> 1:01:47.034
At this point, anything we say further
would be...premature.

1:01:47.955 --> 1:01:51.118
As you know,
this office has a lot on its plate,

1:01:51.250 --> 1:01:55.869
and this is the first we're hearing of
any civil rights issues involving the NOPD.

1:01:57.590 --> 1:01:58.830
Well, then...

1:02:01.886 --> 1:02:03.592
Maybe after the next election.

1:02:12.646 --> 1:02:17.436
All right, everybody, get on up off your seat!
We're gonna party up in here!

1:02:28.245 --> 1:02:30.110
Play it, boy!

1:02:32.583 --> 1:02:34.323

1:03:34.478 --> 1:03:36.218
(Man) Whoo!

1:03:45.990 --> 1:03:47.196
Hey.

1:03:51.328 --> 1:03:53.740
— Hey, Mama.
- Oh!

1:03:54.665 --> 1:03:56.656
lt's first day of Jazz Fest, eh?

1:03:58.711 --> 1:04:00.326
A shame you're grounded, huh?

1:04:00.462 --> 1:04:02.453
I did what I did.

1:04:02.589 --> 1:04:04.875
What happened to the blue?

1:04:05.009 --> 1:04:08.126
Hmm? I was kinda getting used to it.

1:04:10.264 --> 1:04:12.801
— You got homework?
- Some.

1:04:16.854 --> 1:04:18.640
I'm really sad about Oliver.

1:04:18.772 --> 1:04:21.149
He would have been a good mayor.

1:04:21.275 --> 1:04:22.515
Maybe.

1:04:23.569 --> 1:04:25.901
Then again, he did take the money, right?

1:04:26.030 --> 1:04:28.271
Seems so.

1:04:38.167 --> 1:04:40.533
You know, folks just are, Sof.

1:04:41.712 --> 1:04:45.830
Sometimes we're better than ourselves
and sometimes we're worse.

1:04:46.759 --> 1:04:48.841
Sometimes we please and...

1:04:50.679 --> 1:04:53.011
sometimes we disappoint.

1:04:59.772 --> 1:05:01.228
I don't know.

1:05:03.025 --> 1:05:06.142
I guess we're not really talking
about Oliver Thomas anymore, right?

1:05:14.453 --> 1:05:16.614
I still love him.

1:05:18.624 --> 1:05:20.330
| always will.

1:05:22.795 --> 1:05:26.128
But I can't forgive him.

1:05:29.009 --> 1:05:30.624
I know.

1:05:33.806 --> 1:05:36.047
Not yet, anyway, huh?

1:05:50.823 --> 1:05:55.066
J‘ I'm all dressed up in
the grand marshal suit, yeah, oh!

1:05:55.202 --> 1:05:58.945
J‘ Ready to buck jump and party too

1:06:00.290 --> 1:06:02.622
J‘ 'Cause everybody wanna live here

1:06:02.751 --> 1:06:04.958
J‘ Everybody wanna be here!

1:07:18.118 --> 1:07:19.858
See you.

1:07:22.664 --> 1:07:24.746
(Crowd chattering)

1:07:28.420 --> 1:07:31.082
— What the fuck are you wearing, son?
- OK, change of set.

1:07:31.215 --> 1:07:33.672

Yeah, OK. Kurt, bring your Bootsy.

1:07:40.807 --> 1:07:43.423

1:07:53.862 --> 1:07:55.853
(Whooping)

1:07:57.366 --> 1:07:59.948
— (Woman calls out)
— (Wolf—whistling)

1:08:00.077 --> 1:08:03.114
Excuse me.
It has come to my attention...

1:08:03.247 --> 1:08:04.783
that there are some among you

1:08:04.915 --> 1:08:07.782
who feel that someone of my disposition

1:08:07.918 --> 1:08:11.331
cannot, in fact...bring the funk.

1:08:11.463 --> 1:08:13.920
— (Man) You mean, your complexion!
- (People calling out)

1:08:14.049 --> 1:08:15.585
Yes, I know.

1:08:15.717 --> 1:08:17.332
There are those who say...

1:08:17.469 --> 1:08:21.257
"Davis...are you not aware
that you are from...

1:08:22.808 --> 1:08:25.595
— "uptown?"
— (Laughter, shouting)

1:08:25.727 --> 1:08:27.058
Well, then...

1:08:29.690 --> 1:08:32.102
In my final performance with the Brassy Knoll,

1:08:32.234 --> 1:08:35.601
which will no doubt go on to great things
in my absence,

1:08:35.737 --> 1:08:39.855

the following in my defense.

1:08:39.992 --> 1:08:42.153
