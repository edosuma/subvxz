of your part.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.006
Oh, my God, you're right.

00:41.008 --> 00:42.841
You know, I don't mind
so much that you're aging,

00:42.843 --> 00:45.176
it's just the way you're
shoving it down my throat.

00:45.178 --> 00:47.445
Screw you, Peter.
Not today.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.147
(laughing):
Oh, wow!

00:49.149 --> 00:51.916
Mom, Dad, is it okay if I
invite my new boyfriend

00:51.918 --> 00:53.385
over for dinner tonight?

00:53.387 --> 00:54.185
Your what?!

00:54.187 --> 00:56.287
Yes, I share your
mother's skepticism.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.323
No, really, I have a boyfriend.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.457
His name is Anthony.

00:59.459 --> 01:01.826
Well, Meg,
if you're telling us the truth,

01:01.828 --> 01:02.494
I just hope to God

01:02.496 --> 01:04.062
he's an improvement
over the last one.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.297
Thanks, Mrs. Griffin,
that was delicious.

01:06.299 --> 01:07.432
You're welcome, Justin.

01:07.434 --> 01:09.067
It was a pleasure
to meet you.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.802
Come on.
I'll take you home.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.237
Okay, babe.

01:16.442 --> 01:18.410
He ain't got no legs.

01:26.118 --> 01:26.751
<i>Jolly Farm?</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:29.821
I can't believe
you still watch this crap.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.957
Man, how can you
still watch this, huh?

01:32.959 --> 01:33.892
Huh?

01:33.894 --> 01:36.061
You know, I can tell you've
already been drinking,

01:36.063 --> 01:38.897
and I, I just don't
want to engage.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.131
Besides, you can
learn a lot

01:40.133 --> 01:41.099

01:53.046 --> 01:54.179
Oh, didn't know that.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.547
Ooh, ooh, this next
one's my favorite.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.348
It's about the Pan Am
flight from Lockerbie.

01:57.350 --> 02:01.086

02:01.088 --> 02:04.022

02:06.326 --> 02:07.258
Hey, did you read this?

02:07.260 --> 02:08.993
They're gonna be making
an American version

02:08.995 --> 02:11.029
of <i>Jolly Farm</i>
<i>right here in Quahog.</i>

02:11.031 --> 02:13.131
Oh, my God, I didn't
see that. Gimme!

02:13.133 --> 02:17.202
Good Lord, you're right,
an American <i>Jolly Farm!</i>

02:17.204 --> 02:18.236
Oh, there's no picture.

02:18.238 --> 02:20.305
I like the stories
that have pictures.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.439
Ooh, like this one.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.541
"Seven Dead in Mumbai."

02:23.543 --> 02:25.844
I like their hats.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.423
Lois, get in here.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.959
Shh-- Meg's boyfriend.

02:41.794 --> 02:44.195
But there's, there's
nothing wrong with him.

02:44.197 --> 02:45.663
Mom, where's my...?

02:45.665 --> 02:47.132
BOTH:
Shh...

02:47.134 --> 02:48.166
(gasps)

02:48.168 --> 02:49.367
(dialing)

02:49.369 --> 02:52.837
Quagmire, get over here,
you got to see this.

02:56.408 --> 02:58.543
He seems to be
completely normal.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.245
ALL:
Oh...!

03:00.247 --> 03:02.413
I can honestly say
for the first time

03:02.415 --> 03:05.183
that I am attracted
to our daughter.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.851
This must be what
other fathers feel like.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.221
This was worth
the 500-mile drive.

03:11.590 --> 03:14.559
Well, it was very nice
meeting you, Anthony.

03:14.561 --> 03:15.527
You, too,
Mrs. Griffin.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.228
Thanks for having me over
for dinner.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.329
Come on, Peter.

03:18.331 --> 03:20.265
I think Anthony wants
some time alone with Meg.

03:20.267 --> 03:24.135
Who doesn't want some time alone
with Meg these days?

03:24.137 --> 03:25.069
Right, Meg?

03:25.071 --> 03:27.038
Has anybody ever told you
you're pretty enough

03:27.040 --> 03:28.973
to be a movie star,
Mrs. Griffin?

03:28.975 --> 03:31.609
Oh, my goodness. Well,
I don't know about that.

03:31.611 --> 03:34.379
Penelope Ann Miller,
Nancy Travis--

03:34.381 --> 03:36.147
now, those are movie stars.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.382
Look, Anthony, trust me,

03:37.384 --> 03:39.050
she ain't what she used
to be, all right?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.385
Once you get those pants off,

03:40.387 --> 03:43.254
it's like two sagging pressed
hams and a slice of pizza.

03:43.256 --> 03:44.689
Oh, thank you, Peter,

03:44.691 --> 03:46.090
that makes me
feel terrific.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.192
Anyway,
good night, kids.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.527
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

03:49.529 --> 03:52.197
Ah-ah-ah,
on the lips.

03:53.732 --> 03:54.999
Yes!

03:56.435 --> 03:58.503
Do you think
your parents liked me?

03:58.505 --> 04:01.105
Yeah. Can we
make out now?

04:02.274 --> 04:03.975
Oh, I forgot my...

04:03.977 --> 04:05.476
(chuckles)

04:12.284 --> 04:15.386
Oh, my God, that's kind of hot.

04:18.357 --> 04:19.591
(pen scratching)

04:19.593 --> 04:25.496
Mmm, I bet you taste like
Mountain Dew and Starburst.

04:29.468 --> 04:31.736
All right, wish me luck
on my audition, Brian.

04:31.738 --> 04:35.039
If anyone deserves to be
on Jolly Farm, it's me.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.608
Sorry, all the boys
can go home.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.444
We only have one part
left for a little girl.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.545
What?

04:40.547 --> 04:41.646
No! No, that's impossible!

04:41.648 --> 04:42.947
Oh, that's too bad,
Stewie.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.616
Well, I guess
we can go home now.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.050
But I don't want
to go home.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.318
I want to be
on <i>Jolly Farm!</i>

04:47.320 --> 04:48.419
Well, you heard her.

04:48.421 --> 04:49.554
They're only auditioning
little girls.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.322
Now, come on,
let's get out of here.

04:51.324 --> 04:53.691
I suppose you're right;
nothing I can do.

04:53.693 --> 04:58.296
Okay, our next young actress
on the audition list is

04:58.298 --> 05:00.131
Karina Smirnoff.

05:00.733 --> 05:04.369
(girlish English accent):
Hello, everyone!

05:09.408 --> 05:11.042
(girlish English accent):
Thank you all so much

05:11.044 --> 05:13.011
for squeezing me in
for an audition.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.646
So, should we
just jump in?

05:14.648 --> 05:15.680
Sure.
When you're ready.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.082
All right, let me
just get into character.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.317
I'm a bit distracted.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.152
I wasn't expecting
we'd do this today

05:21.154 --> 05:22.654
in light of the circumstances.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.554
What circumstances?

05:23.556 --> 05:26.624
Oh, dear God, didn't you hear?
The bomb.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.793
The bomb that went off
in Times Square.

05:28.795 --> 05:31.696
(choking up):
All those poor people... dead!

05:31.698 --> 05:34.299
Oh, my God, my cousin
works in Times Square.

05:34.301 --> 05:38.236
Well, your cousin is fine
because I was <i>acting!</i>

05:38.238 --> 05:40.838
That's impressive.
Oh, wow.
Risky, very risky.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.874
All right, fun's over.
What do you want me to read?

05:42.876 --> 05:45.677
We want you to read
your new contract.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.412
(gasps)
You mean it?

05:47.414 --> 05:49.580
Absolutely.
You're hired.

05:49.582 --> 05:51.983
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh!

05:51.985 --> 05:54.986
Well, I guess sometimes
you're just right for the part.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.455
Like James Earl Jones
playing Darth Vader.

05:57.457 --> 06:03.928
So, James, we just want
you to do the voice.

06:06.231 --> 06:08.499
Thanks for taking time
for me today, Bonnie.

06:08.501 --> 06:10.468
I just didn't know
who else to talk to.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.137
Oh, that's okay, Lois.
What's on your mind?

06:13.139 --> 06:15.340
Well, you're going to
think I'm an awful person,

06:15.342 --> 06:19.110
but I'm attracted
to another man.

06:19.112 --> 06:19.677
Giggity?

06:19.679 --> 06:21.846
It's Meg's boyfriend
Anthony.

06:21.848 --> 06:22.714
(sadly):
Giggity.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.348
It's just that, lately,

06:23.350 --> 06:26.718
Peter's been making me feel
so crappy about my age, and...

06:26.720 --> 06:28.186
Well, then I'm around Anthony,

06:28.188 --> 06:30.788
and he looks at me like
I'm young and attractive.

06:30.790 --> 06:33.391
I'm going to tell you
a secret, Lois.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.093
I had an affair once.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.861
(gasps)
You had an affair?

06:36.863 --> 06:39.697
Mm-hmm. It wasn't
anything sordid.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.299
Just some guys I met
on the Internet.

06:41.301 --> 06:45.436
The point is, it's healthy
to explore your sexuality.

06:45.438 --> 06:47.338
Oh, I don't know.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.607
It just feels like
I'm lying to Peter...

06:49.609 --> 06:52.110
like Jesus lied
to the meek.

06:53.479 --> 06:54.512
All right.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.547
Jesus and the jocks
win again.

06:56.549 --> 06:59.784
Hey, you said we were gonna
inherit the earth.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.153
Yeah, when we're done with it.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.489
(boy grunts, jocks chuckle)

07:13.165 --> 07:14.332
Hello there.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.066
Hello.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.502
Um, I'm new in town
and I'm awfully lonely.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.671
I'm wondering if you wouldn't
mind buying me a drink?

07:20.673 --> 07:21.939
Well, that'd
be my pleasure.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.875
And maybe later
I can show you some

07:23.877 --> 07:25.510
of the local points
of interest.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.578
There's one right
below the table.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.147
Oh, my, you're very bold.

07:29.149 --> 07:32.283
Well, when your life span
is 13 years, you got
to be direct.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.653
Lucky for you,
I like bold men.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.355
Karina, Karina Smirnoff.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.857
Brian, Brian Steel.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.626
Ooh, good heavens.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.161
Man, your accent
is sexy.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.329
Oh, this is all moving
very quickly.

07:45.331 --> 07:47.131
I'm afraid
I'm a little light-headed.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.499
You must think
I'm a fool.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.402
I'm-I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to come on too strong.

07:51.404 --> 07:52.437
Oh, that's all right.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.405
I've been missing
a man's touch

07:54.407 --> 07:55.740
lo these many months.

07:55.742 --> 07:59.410
And I've been missing
a woman's touch.

08:01.213 --> 08:04.715
(normal voice):
Brian, Brian, it's me, Stewie.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.851
Oh, my God,
that was hilarious.

08:06.853 --> 08:07.685
You really fell for it.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.854
I-I was, like,
"Is he gonna fall for this?"

08:09.856 --> 08:11.556
And then when you did,
I was like,

08:11.558 --> 08:13.624
"I guess I should see
how far I can take it

08:13.626 --> 08:15.259
'cause, you know,
it'll be funnier."

08:15.261 --> 08:16.227
I'm gonna kill you!

08:16.229 --> 08:17.495
Why are you dressed
like that?!

08:17.497 --> 08:19.630
Uh, because I'm the star
of <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

08:19.632 --> 08:22.500
Remember how they only
needed little girls?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.801
Oh, my God.

08:23.803 --> 08:24.702
I'm telling Lois.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.737
You're not telling
anybody, friend.

08:26.739 --> 08:29.774
No, no, you're gonna
be my on-set guardian.

08:29.776 --> 08:30.842
You're out of your mind.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.276
Brian, we both know
I touched it.

08:32.278 --> 08:33.644
Now, if you'd like
to keep that just between us,

08:33.646 --> 08:37.815
I suggest you sit back down and
order me some chicken fingers.

08:39.218 --> 08:42.320
See? We're having
a nice time.

08:43.922 --> 08:46.390
All right, first scene up
is on page 12.

08:46.392 --> 08:49.494
Everybody, this is
our new Jolly Farm resident,

08:49.496 --> 08:50.461
Karina Smirnoff.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.063
She'll be playing
the role of Mary.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.333
Hello.
Hi, I'm Julie.

08:58.370 --> 08:59.770
(normal voice):
Oh, hello, I'm Stew...

08:59.772 --> 09:00.972
(girlishly):
Uh, I'm Karina.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.540
Can we get some
quiet on the set?

09:02.542 --> 09:03.774
I'm trying
to rehearse.

09:03.776 --> 09:04.976
STAGEHAND:
Quiet on the set!

09:04.978 --> 09:05.977
Don't mind Randall.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.645
He's getting
into character.

09:07.647 --> 09:08.846
Is he playing a dick?

09:08.848 --> 09:10.281
All right, everybody,
here we go.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.517
Scene ten.
Places, please.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.784
And... action!

09:13.786 --> 09:16.454
Oh, it's so great being here
on Jolly Farm.

09:16.456 --> 09:19.190
Let's go to the barn
and meet the animals.

09:19.192 --> 09:19.891
Yeah! Hey, Mary,

09:19.893 --> 09:22.460
bet I'll beat you
to the barn.

09:22.462 --> 09:23.594
That sounds like

09:23.596 --> 09:24.896
a really chauvinistic
presumption.

09:24.898 --> 09:28.399
I mean, because I'm a woman,
you think you'll beat me?

09:28.401 --> 09:30.601
A man is automatically
better than a woman

09:30.603 --> 09:31.536
at any physical challenge?

09:31.538 --> 09:35.406
Well, here are a few women
who might beat you to the barn:

09:35.408 --> 09:37.308
Joanie Benoit,
Jackie Joyner-Kersee,

09:37.310 --> 09:40.244
Babe Didrikson Zaharias,
Mary Decker, Zola Budd...

09:40.246 --> 09:40.778
Cut!

09:40.780 --> 09:43.814
Karina, your line is,
"That sounds fun."

09:43.816 --> 09:44.949
Well, yes, Dan,
but I felt

09:44.951 --> 09:46.417
that just because
we're on a farm,

09:46.419 --> 09:49.387
it doesn't mean we have
to be stuck in the 19th century

09:49.389 --> 09:50.521
with our value system.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.123
Mary needs to stand up
for herself.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.560
Hmm... interesting.
I suppose we don't really have

09:55.562 --> 09:57.595
an outspoken female character
on the show.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.597
All right, Karina,
we'll try it your way

09:59.599 --> 10:01.866
and see what
happens.
Good luck.

10:01.868 --> 10:04.569
She'll be gone
in three episodes.

10:06.471 --> 10:11.409
♪ Go, Stewie, go!

10:12.711 --> 10:17.915
♪ Roll, Stewie, roll!

10:19.051 --> 10:24.655
♪ Sweet Stewie roll...!

10:32.231 --> 10:35.032
(flirtatiously):
Hi, Anthony.
Hi, Mrs. Griffin.

10:35.034 --> 10:36.667
You know, we've
enjoyed having you

10:36.669 --> 10:39.003
around so much lately,
so we got a little

10:39.005 --> 10:42.773
"welcome to the family"
present for you.

10:42.775 --> 10:45.676
Your husband's work
and poker game schedule?

10:45.678 --> 10:47.912
(whispering):
My menstrual cycle's
on there, too,

10:47.914 --> 10:50.014
but I don't mind
if you don't.

10:50.016 --> 10:50.815
Uh, thanks.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.883
Oh, by the way, Meg,
I forgot to tell you,

10:52.885 --> 10:55.620
your grandfather needs you to
pick him up at the airport.

10:55.622 --> 10:59.690
Ugh, Grandpa always makes me
so nervous when I'm driving.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.494
(clicks empty)

11:03.496 --> 11:05.830
Okay, now me.

11:05.832 --> 11:06.998
That's a stop sign.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.766
Anthony, you want
to come with me?

11:08.768 --> 11:09.800
Sure.

11:09.802 --> 11:10.835
Oh, don't be ridiculous,

11:10.837 --> 11:12.903
I'll keep him company
till you get back.

11:12.905 --> 11:14.739
Good-bye, Meg.

11:15.407 --> 11:16.607
Let's not play games.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.042
The other day, you
said I was attractive.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.044
Now, what are we
gonna do about it?

11:20.046 --> 11:21.279
Oh, my God.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.413
Wow, this is so cool.

11:22.415 --> 11:25.383
I've never had a MILF
come on to me before.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.351
Can I, can I kiss you?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.519
Let me ask you this:

11:28.521 --> 11:30.521
Do my gray hairs
bother you?

11:30.523 --> 11:31.956
What gray hairs?

11:31.958 --> 11:34.392
Oh, kiss me.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.693
(moaning)

11:35.695 --> 11:36.994
Mom, I forgot my keys.

11:36.996 --> 11:38.663
Do you know where...?

11:38.665 --> 11:41.198
Um... rape?

11:41.200 --> 11:46.370
(Seinfeld transitional cue
plays)

11:51.109 --> 11:53.944
Hey, another batch
of fan mail, Karina.

11:53.946 --> 11:55.012
Oh, careful, Sam,

11:55.014 --> 11:57.248
you're emptying
your sack all over me.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.083
(laughing):
What?!

11:59.085 --> 12:00.151
Stewie, how
the hell long

12:00.153 --> 12:02.119
do you think you can
keep up this charade?

12:02.121 --> 12:04.355
I will keep up
this "cha-rahd"--

12:04.357 --> 12:06.957
as it's pronounced, Brian--
as long as I see fit.

12:06.959 --> 12:08.459
Ooh, ooh, shh, shh, shh.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.293
Hi, Karina.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.661
(girlish voice):
Oh, hi, Julie.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.029
God, I love
your makeup.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.898
You know, I'm thinking
of asking them

12:13.900 --> 12:15.166
to do my makeup
like yours.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.701
Oh, you don't
need makeup.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.102
I mean, I need all
the help I can get,

12:18.104 --> 12:20.037
but you have such a
youthful look,

12:20.039 --> 12:21.706
you could pass
for 11 months.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.808
Ugh, then why do I feel
like 40 months?

12:23.810 --> 12:26.077
You've got to stop
doing that to yourself.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.278
You're fantastic.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.648
Oh, I think you're the nicest
person I've ever met.

12:30.650 --> 12:33.517
Hey, baby, you ready
to go take a nap?

12:33.519 --> 12:35.853
Oh, okay, Randall.

12:36.955 --> 12:38.823
I don't think
that guy is right for her.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.491
Do you see the way
he treats her?

12:40.493 --> 12:41.058
Why do you care?

12:41.060 --> 12:44.362
Because... I think
I'm in love with her.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.162
Whenever I talk to her,

12:45.164 --> 12:47.465
it makes my Band-Aid
start to peel off.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.566
What are you
talking about?

12:48.568 --> 12:50.000
I'm talking
about my thing.

12:50.002 --> 12:51.168
Got to hide it
for the cameras.

12:51.170 --> 12:52.770
Instead of tucking,
I just push it in

12:52.772 --> 12:54.538
like a button and put
a Band-Aid over it.

12:54.540 --> 12:55.673
What kind of Band-Aid?

12:55.675 --> 12:57.708
Big one, big giant one.

12:57.710 --> 13:01.479
Nah, just one of those
little dots you put on a shot.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.953
Okay, Brian, watch,
here comes my big part.

13:08.955 --> 13:13.958
Oh, here comes Large Bird and
Moody Green Garbage Creature.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.793
Wow, you're a big bird.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.995
And I'm grouchy,
so get out of my way!

13:17.997 --> 13:20.331
You watch that tone,
Moody Green Garbage Creature,

13:20.333 --> 13:24.068
or I'll get Bernie and Gert
over here to kick your butt.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.569
Is there a problem here?

13:25.571 --> 13:28.072
Yeah, you need us
to use our fists?

13:28.074 --> 13:29.540
Look at Julie, Brian.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.510
She's absolutely beautiful.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.978
(doorbell rings)

13:35.180 --> 13:38.582
Julie, hi, w-we were
just talking about you.

13:38.584 --> 13:39.717
Oh, hi, do I know you?

13:39.719 --> 13:43.154
Oh, right, yeah--
no, you don't, you know Karina.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.021
I'm her brother Stewie.

13:44.023 --> 13:45.823
It's nice to meet you.
Is she home?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.658
Oh, yeah, yeah,
she's upstairs.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.259
Come in.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.394
Brian, you've met
Julie, right?

13:50.396 --> 13:53.264
Julie's my sister's
costar on <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

13:53.266 --> 13:54.064
Hi, Brian.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.666
Why don't you
keep her company

13:55.668 --> 13:56.867
while I go fetch Karina?

13:56.869 --> 13:58.969
Just make sure
you get her fast.

13:58.971 --> 14:00.137
Karina?
(as Karina):
Yes?

14:00.139 --> 14:01.739
(as Stewie):
You have a visitor.
Who is it?

14:01.741 --> 14:03.974
It's that nice girl,
Julie, from your show.

14:03.976 --> 14:06.043
Oh, Julie-- did she
say what she wanted?

14:06.045 --> 14:07.278
Just go see for yourself.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.846
I'm not your
secretary, Karina.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.880
Why are you
so cruel to me?

14:09.882 --> 14:11.015
Is it because
I'm the pretty one?

14:11.017 --> 14:12.850
The talented one?
Oh, for God's sakes.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.185
You know, we're
all sick of you.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.286
That's right, all of us.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.688
Sick of me?!
Oh, that's rich.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.523
You know, I wasn't
going to say this,

14:19.525 --> 14:20.758
but Mother hates you.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.593
That's not true,
you take that back!

14:22.595 --> 14:23.861
It is true, she hates you!

14:23.863 --> 14:26.030
She told me, it was
the Christmas we all went

14:26.032 --> 14:27.731
to Edaville Railroad,
and you cried

14:27.733 --> 14:30.034
because you were afraid
because one of Santa's elves

14:30.036 --> 14:31.669
was a real midget,
and father said,

14:31.671 --> 14:33.938
"That's it, I can't
take this anymore,"

14:33.940 --> 14:35.105
and he left that very night

14:35.107 --> 14:37.842
and all you cared about was
ice cream on the way home

14:37.844 --> 14:40.044
and Mother said you didn't
appreciate anything!

14:40.046 --> 14:41.579
BRIAN:
Karina!
Coming!

14:41.581 --> 14:43.514
Hello, Julie.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.216
So nice to see you.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.183
Please.

14:46.185 --> 14:47.218
Two lemonades, Brian.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.053
Oh, yeah, I'll go
make you a lemonade.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.688
I'll make you
a fresh one.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.056
So, what brings you here?

14:52.058 --> 14:53.958
Well, I wanted to see
if you could come over

14:53.960 --> 14:55.826
to my house tonight
and run lines with me.

14:55.828 --> 14:58.095
Don't you usually
do that with Randall?

14:58.097 --> 14:59.797
We kind of had a fight.

14:59.799 --> 15:00.831
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.601
I thought maybe you and I
could have a sleepover tonight.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.102
You know, a little girl time.

15:05.104 --> 15:06.337
Oh, that would be so fun.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.138
Yes, let's.
Terrific.

15:08.140 --> 15:09.006
I can't wait.

15:09.008 --> 15:11.342
Hey, do you mind if I say
good-bye to your brother?

15:11.344 --> 15:13.978
(sighs)
Fine.

15:13.980 --> 15:14.879
Stewie!

15:14.881 --> 15:16.013
(as Stewie):
What?

15:16.015 --> 15:17.948
Julie would like to
say good-bye to you.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.049
Well? Answer me.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.084
I'm not talking to you.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.019
You're being a baby.
Go say good-bye.

15:22.021 --> 15:23.120
Why? She's
your friend.

15:23.122 --> 15:24.288
And why should
I do you any favors

15:24.290 --> 15:26.056
after the terrible things
you said to me earlier?

15:26.058 --> 15:28.158
Well, at least I didn't bring
up that time at Brigham's

15:28.160 --> 15:30.494
when you showed your fanny to
that girl in the wheelchair.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.396
Julie's gone.
(as Stewie):
That's fine, Brian,

15:32.398 --> 15:34.064
we're having a
conversation up here.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.699
That girl in the wheelchair
called me a name.

15:35.701 --> 15:39.570
(as Karina):
Yes, well, that gives you
no right to be a blackguard!

15:45.110 --> 15:47.211
Meg, honey, I think
we need to talk.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.346
I don't want to talk to you.
Get out!

15:49.348 --> 15:52.049
Look, I understand
that you're upset.

15:52.051 --> 15:54.285
You made out
with my boyfriend.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.219
How could you do that?

15:55.221 --> 15:58.923
I don't know, sweetheart,
but I am so, so sorry.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.658
It was an awful thing
that I did.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.626
I never meant to
steal him from you.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.194
Is that what you think?

16:04.196 --> 16:05.829
You stole him from me?

16:05.831 --> 16:06.764
Are you kidding?

16:06.766 --> 16:08.232
You couldn't steal him from me.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.768
Well, I do know
a few things, Meg,

16:10.770 --> 16:13.003
and clearly, if I wanted him,
I could have him.

16:13.005 --> 16:15.139
You really think
you stand a chance?

16:15.141 --> 16:17.808
Look at you, you're old,
you're nothing.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.444
You couldn't even imagine
the things I do for him.

16:20.446 --> 16:24.214
And this isn't about making out;
this is about power tools.

16:24.216 --> 16:27.284
Yeah, I go to places
you couldn't get back from.

16:27.286 --> 16:28.686
I'll do anything.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.220
You don't know me.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.257
Oh, my God!

16:33.259 --> 16:34.358
He hangs me from
the shower rod

16:34.360 --> 16:36.794
with your old bras, and
then we laugh at you.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.762
Now get out of my room.

16:38.764 --> 16:42.766
Well, when you're
ready to talk...

16:44.836 --> 16:47.037
Are you okay in there, Karina?

16:47.039 --> 16:48.172
Be right out.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.740
Just rinsing off
my Noxzema.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.075
I'm so glad you came over.

16:51.077 --> 16:53.277
Oh, so am I, Jules;
it's been so fun.

16:53.279 --> 16:57.114
So, I guess I sleep
in the guest room or whatnot?

16:57.116 --> 16:58.248
No, you can sleep
in here with me.

16:58.250 --> 17:02.953
Oh, well, my goodness, I hope
there's room for both of us.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.322
I'll just have to
squeeze in here.

17:05.324 --> 17:07.057
Well, good night, Karina.

17:07.059 --> 17:12.062
You know, I really like
spending time with you, Julie.

17:12.064 --> 17:12.997
Me, too.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.298
Why couldn't we just
have girlfriends

17:14.300 --> 17:16.000
instead of boyfriends?
I know.

17:16.002 --> 17:19.236
It's all just one big,
confusing mess.

17:19.238 --> 17:21.171
Can I snuggle with you?

17:21.173 --> 17:22.906
Uh-huh.

17:22.908 --> 17:25.275
(sweet melody plays)

17:27.078 --> 17:30.180
Good night, Julie.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.422
Well, I hope you're
happy, Peter.

17:38.424 --> 17:41.392
Our daughter hates me and
it's all because of you.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.459
Me? What the hell did I do?

17:42.461 --> 17:44.294
You've made me feel
so unattractive lately

17:44.296 --> 17:45.396
that I went and
did something

17:45.398 --> 17:48.632
disgusting and abhorrent
and I'm ashamed of myself.

17:48.634 --> 17:51.035
Peter, I made out
with Meg's boyfriend.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.103
You made out
with Meg's boyfriend?

17:53.105 --> 17:54.538
How the hell could
you do that to me?

17:54.540 --> 17:57.508
Because, Peter, you've been
making me feel old and fat

17:57.510 --> 17:59.843
and unattractive
and worthless.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.178
How do you expect me
to respond?

18:01.180 --> 18:04.748
Lois, I think you're
the most beautiful woman

18:04.750 --> 18:05.983
I ever seen in my life.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.185
Well, but then why
have you been saying

18:08.187 --> 18:09.219
all these horrible things?

18:09.221 --> 18:13.157
Because I'm old and fat and
unattractive and worthless.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.292
I guess I thought that
if I could bring you down,

18:15.294 --> 18:18.128
you wouldn't start to notice
that you're too good for me

18:18.130 --> 18:20.097
and run off looking
for another fella.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.833
Peter, that's
ridiculous.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.101
I love you.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.436
Why?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.504
Maybe I like fat guys.

18:27.506 --> 18:28.305
You do?

18:28.307 --> 18:31.275
Maybe I like having
sex with fat guys.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.242
Yeah?

18:32.244 --> 18:35.245
Maybe I want to have sex
with a fat guy right now.

18:35.247 --> 18:39.116
Well, maybe I want to have sex
with an ugly, old broad.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.584
Peter!
Gotcha!

18:40.586 --> 18:42.419
(laughing):
Wow!

18:42.421 --> 18:45.889
(both moaning)

18:48.093 --> 18:49.793
I'm going insane, Brian.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.995
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

18:51.997 --> 18:54.865
I've got to tell Julie
my true feelings.

18:54.867 --> 18:55.933
So, tell her.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.234
Have you heard, Karina?

18:57.236 --> 18:58.969
We're gonna be doing
the show live today.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.070
I'm so nervous.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.172
I've never been on
live TV before.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.308
Would you give me
a hug for luck?

19:07.112 --> 19:10.013
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm not done yet.

19:10.015 --> 19:11.882
Karina, what are you...

19:11.884 --> 19:13.283
(moaning)

19:13.285 --> 19:15.319
Oh, oh, I'm not...

19:15.321 --> 19:16.754
I'm not a lesbian.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.322
No, no, I'm not either.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.556
What are you exactly?

19:19.558 --> 19:21.291
I'm sorry, Karina.

19:21.293 --> 19:24.328
If only you were a boy.

19:25.029 --> 19:27.498
But... I am a boy.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.900
DIRECTOR:
Okay, everybody,
we're live in five.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.269
You'd better
get out there.

19:33.438 --> 19:36.206
Four, three, two...

19:36.208 --> 19:40.077
Good morning and welcome
to <i>Jolly Farm.</i>

19:40.079 --> 19:43.313
Today we're going to learn
about the letter "T."

19:43.315 --> 19:46.517
I've got something
to say, Mother Maggie.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.484
You do?

19:47.486 --> 19:49.286
Well, maybe that can wait
till later, Mary.

19:49.288 --> 19:51.588
No, I think this needs
to come out now.

19:51.590 --> 19:55.893
You see, I didn't move
to Jolly Farm from the big city

19:55.895 --> 19:57.227
to be around animals.

19:57.229 --> 20:01.031
I moved here because my uncle
was molesting my sister,

20:01.033 --> 20:03.567
and my parents wanted her
to start a new life.

20:03.569 --> 20:05.736
But my sister Mary
shot herself in the face,

20:05.738 --> 20:09.540
and that's when I decided that
she would live on through me.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.442
For I am not who you think I am.

20:12.444 --> 20:15.112
I am not little Mary Sunflower,

20:15.114 --> 20:18.916
daughter of Bradley
and Theresa Sunflower.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.384
No, I'm not.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.186
(as Stewie):
I'm Desmond Sunflower!

20:22.188 --> 20:25.088
Desmond Sunflower,
and I'm a boy!

20:25.090 --> 20:27.624
(all gasping)

20:27.626 --> 20:30.194
A perfectly normal little boy.

20:30.196 --> 20:33.564
Who also happens
to be a transvestite.

20:33.566 --> 20:37.501
Which begins
with the letter "T."

20:44.242 --> 20:45.609
I'm ready.

20:45.611 --> 20:46.543
Did you talk to Julie?

20:46.545 --> 20:48.145
Her mother won't
let me see her.

20:48.147 --> 20:50.948
It doesn't matter anyway;
she's back with Randall.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.149
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:52.151 --> 20:53.984
Hey, why were they
shooting that scene live?

20:53.986 --> 20:55.552
Convenience.
Yeah, but why'd they...?

20:55.554 --> 20:58.021
Let's not start pulling
threads on this one.

20:58.023 --> 21:00.390
Can we go home?
Sure.

21:02.493 --> 21:04.928
You want to get
some ice cream?

21:04.930 --> 21:05.596
Well, why not?

21:05.598 --> 21:08.098
I don't have to fit
in that dress anymore.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.567
Hey, can I
borrow the dress?

21:10.569 --> 21:12.002
What?
Nah, I'm
just kidding.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.203
I'm just
doing some playful

21:13.205 --> 21:15.472
walking-away banter
during the music.

21:15.474 --> 21:16.540
Can we not do that?

21:16.542 --> 21:18.141
I have such a headache.

21:18.143 --> 21:18.709
Sorry.

21:18.711 --> 21:23.046

21:23.048 --> 21:28.118
