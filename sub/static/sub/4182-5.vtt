52:39.448 --> 52:40.904
It wasn't an overdose.

52:43.494 --> 52:44.859
Why?

52:45.079 --> 52:46.785
Jax's order.

52:47.248 --> 52:49.864
That's what you do
when someone's a threat.

52:52.711 --> 52:57.876
That night I almost OD'd at Diosa...

52:59.552 --> 53:02.259
...Nero was trying to help me.

53:03.889 --> 53:06.505
I was in such bad shape.

53:08.394 --> 53:09.759
I confessed.

53:11.564 --> 53:13.520
Told him the truth.

53:14.692 --> 53:17.149
Jax lied about Darvany.

53:19.363 --> 53:21.854
That's why
the club wants me dead.

53:22.449 --> 53:24.861
I betrayed our king.

53:29.123 --> 53:30.363
I'm sorry.

53:30.583 --> 53:33.165
Yeah. Me too.

53:34.295 --> 53:37.958
Because that's also how I know
you're lying to me, Gem.

53:41.218 --> 53:42.628
Nero would never help me.

53:46.265 --> 53:48.301
GEMMA:
Damn it. No!

53:48.559 --> 53:49.969
[GUNSHOT]

53:58.861 --> 54:02.979
Let the sunshine

54:03.991 --> 54:05.231
Stop running.

54:05.409 --> 54:08.071
[GUNSHOTS AND GEMMA SCREAMS]

54:10.789 --> 54:13.121
You were gonna kill me?
NO. I don't know.

54:13.334 --> 54:16.121
I don't know.

54:16.337 --> 54:18.419
I didn't know what else to do.

54:18.631 --> 54:20.838
I saved you.

54:22.343 --> 54:24.504
I trusted you.

54:25.471 --> 54:29.430
But I couldn't trust you. |--

54:30.059 --> 54:31.265
I'm sorry.

54:32.728 --> 54:37.518
Please. Please.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please

54:37.733 --> 54:40.190
I'm sorry.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.395
Please, sweetheart.

54:46.825 --> 54:50.738
Please, sweetheart.
I'm sorry. Please.

54:51.288 --> 54:53.279
GEMMA:
Don 't kill me.

54:53.874 --> 54:57.867
Let the sunshine

54:58.379 --> 55:02.292
Let the sunshine in

55:02.466 --> 55:06.425
Let the sunshine in

55:07.721 --> 55:11.555
Let the sunshine
