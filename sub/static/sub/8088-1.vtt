02:06.927 --> 02:09.884
I'm telling you, Arnold,
your ball is flat.

02:10.047 --> 02:13.801
It's not flat.
It's just a little low on air.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.039
Like I said, your ball is flat.

02:17.207 --> 02:20.358
I can't believe
we let those fifth graders beat us.

02:20.527 --> 02:25.157
- The thing is we tried our best.
- We got our buns whupped.

02:25.327 --> 02:28.285
Come on, we had fun.
And we almost beat 'em.

02:28.447 --> 02:32.599
Why do you always have
to look on the bright side?

02:32.767 --> 02:34.485
Somebody has to.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.841
- Mr Green, what's going on?
- It's Scheck.

02:43.007 --> 02:47.125
He wants to knock down the whole
neighborhood and put up a fancy mall.

02:47.287 --> 02:48.925
Who's Scheck?

02:49.087 --> 02:51.760
<i>The plan, approved</i>
<i>by the mayor moments ago,</i>

02:51.927 --> 02:54.885
<i>would allow Future Tech Industries</i>
<i>to redevelop</i>

02:55.047 --> 02:59.438
<i>a six-square-block area</i>
<i>between 33rd and 39th Streets.</i>

02:59.607 --> 03:02.758
I understand the president and CEO
of Future Tech Industries,

03:02.927 --> 03:06.556
Mr Scheck,
is about to make a statement.

03:07.047 --> 03:11.677
I'm delighted at the mayor's
support of our renewal plan.

03:11.847 --> 03:13.724
- Nice suit.
- Sh!

03:13.887 --> 03:17.562
I am behind
Mr Scheck's project 100%.

03:18.927 --> 03:21.964
Although some of you
may have concerns

03:22.127 --> 03:25.199
about how this plan will impact
your homes and businesses,

03:25.367 --> 03:27.927
I assure you, change is good.

03:28.087 --> 03:31.124
This plan represents
the end of urban decay,

03:31.287 --> 03:34.643
the end of your broken-down shops
and apartment buildings,

03:34.807 --> 03:37.924
the end of antiquated
and dilapidated storefronts.

03:38.087 --> 03:42.239
It's time for a new world.
Out with the old, in with the new.

03:42.407 --> 03:45.205
What's wrong with old things?
Some are great.

03:45.367 --> 03:48.006
- Yeah, like Mrs Vitello.
- Whippersnapper.

03:48.967 --> 03:54.325
The city council are against it,
but the mayor's lettin' him do it.

03:54.487 --> 03:57.923
- I never figured he'd pull it off.
- What does it mean?

03:58.087 --> 04:03.241
They want us to move away
so Scheck's corporation can move in.

04:03.407 --> 04:06.319
- No!
- No way!

04:07.087 --> 04:09.362
It's time to put the past behind us.

04:09.527 --> 04:14.157
I have seen the future,
and it's Future Tech Industries.

04:14.327 --> 04:19.003
- But this is our neighborhood.
- They can't just tear it down.

04:19.286 --> 04:21.846
<i>This is our neighborhood</i>

04:22.007 --> 04:25.204
<i>How can they tear it down</i>

04:25.367 --> 04:28.803
<i>How can they turn our smile</i>

04:28.967 --> 04:31.197
<i>Into a frown</i>

04:33.047 --> 04:35.686
<i>We may be just a few</i>

04:35.847 --> 04:38.645
<i>But if me and you and you</i>

04:38.807 --> 04:43.403
- No. No singing, Eugene.
- I thought the occasion called for it.

04:43.567 --> 04:48.038
- <i>We may be just a few...</i>
- No. This is serious.

04:50.567 --> 04:52.080
Oh, my...

04:54.327 --> 04:56.887
We can't take this lying down.
We should do something.

04:57.047 --> 05:01.518
- Yeah, but what can we do?
- We can refuse to sell our houses.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.599
Sign a petition!

05:04.767 --> 05:10.922
This is our neighborhood and
we're not giving it up without a fight!

05:11.087 --> 05:14.318
Arnold! What an annoying
little goody two-shoes.

05:14.847 --> 05:18.556
What a dopey little dreamer.
What a corny little cornball.

05:18.727 --> 05:23.323
Always trying to get everyone
to look on the bright side.

05:23.487 --> 05:27.275
How I despise him. And yet...

05:27.927 --> 05:33.365
I love him! I love his unerring sense
of right and wrong.

05:33.527 --> 05:37.361
I love his insistence on the needs of
the many over the needs of the few.

05:37.847 --> 05:40.759
I love most how
his hair smells up close,

05:40.927 --> 05:45.239
then he looks at me and
I make an excuse for being so close.

05:45.407 --> 05:48.683
Then I insult him to cover up
the secret, adoring feelings

05:48.847 --> 05:53.523
which I have so long
and painfully harbored. Oh, Arnold!

05:53.687 --> 05:57.475
- Mr Green can write the petition.
- Say no more. I'm already on it.

05:57.647 --> 05:59.638
If only I had the guts to tell you.

05:59.807 --> 06:03.516
If only I weren't such a coward
and had your strength.

06:03.687 --> 06:05.643
We'll get everybody to sign.

06:05.807 --> 06:08.401
What if you lose
and the neighborhood is torn down,

06:08.567 --> 06:11.559
you move away
and we never see each other again

06:11.727 --> 06:16.084
and I never tell you
how I really feel about you?

06:16.247 --> 06:18.966
Oh, Arnold, how I love you.

06:26.127 --> 06:27.526
Dad!

06:28.247 --> 06:31.205
- How's it going, Miriam?
- Molasses, it's you.

06:31.607 --> 06:35.441
- Great, but where does the store go?
- Here. Big Bob's Beeper Emporium.

06:35.607 --> 06:39.759
Big sign, can't miss it, and the overpass
drops you right in the parkin' lot.

06:39.927 --> 06:43.203
- That's good. Right in the stinkin' lot.
- Dad?

06:43.367 --> 06:45.801
- What, Olga?
- It's Helga, Dad.

06:45.967 --> 06:48.322
- That's what I said.
- Could we talk?

06:48.487 --> 06:51.126
- We gotta split. We'll talk.
- Right.

06:51.327 --> 06:54.080
Send me the paperwork.
I can't wait to start.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.841
- Can I keep this pop-up thing?
- You got it.

06:57.007 --> 06:59.123
Know what this is? It's our future.

06:59.287 --> 07:02.245
Here's where my new Super
Beeper Emporium is gonna go up,

07:02.407 --> 07:06.639
right after we rip down the flower shop,
Green Meats and the rest.

07:06.807 --> 07:10.641
Yeah, about all that... Lots of people
will have to sell up and move.

07:10.807 --> 07:12.240
What's your point?

07:12.407 --> 07:14.921
I was just wondering if this whole
tear-down-the-neighborhood

07:15.087 --> 07:16.725
Future Tech thing is really necessary.

07:16.887 --> 07:19.879
It's more than necessary.
It's progress.

07:20.047 --> 07:22.800
You can't have progress without pain.
No pain, no gain.

07:22.967 --> 07:26.437
What's wrong with leaving things
the way they are?

07:26.607 --> 07:30.486
Leave things the way they are and
Big Bob's Emporium doesn't happen.

07:30.647 --> 07:32.239
But, Dad...

07:32.407 --> 07:36.446
I'll say this once, and I want
you to hear it. Change is good.

07:36.607 --> 07:39.246
When the new Big Bob's
Super Beeper Emporium goes up,

07:39.407 --> 07:42.797
the cash will roll in and
you'll forget the old neighborhood.

07:42.967 --> 07:47.438
And do you know why?
Because we'll be rich.

07:47.607 --> 07:51.122
That means you'll be rich.
You can have that pony.

07:51.287 --> 07:54.279
- I wanted a pony when I was five.
- What do you want now?

07:54.447 --> 07:56.881
- I don't know.
- Make up your mind,

07:57.047 --> 08:01.518
'cause once my store goes up,
you can have anything you want.

08:05.087 --> 08:07.362
- Anything?
- That's what I said.

08:07.527 --> 08:11.076
We're gonna be
stinkin' rich, girl. Rich.

08:11.247 --> 08:14.603
What's more important
than that, huh?

08:29.207 --> 08:31.767
- Grandpa?
- That's my name. Don't wear it out.

08:35.727 --> 08:38.719
- Grandpa, I'm worried.
- Oh, don't worry, Arnold.

08:38.886 --> 08:42.482
We won't sell up.
We're right behind you. Right, pookie?

08:45.207 --> 08:47.846
Home team, home team, woo!

08:49.567 --> 08:51.398
What if Scheck
makes everyone else sell?

08:51.567 --> 08:55.116
Then I guess they'll bulldoze
down the neighborhood.

08:55.287 --> 08:58.563
We'll have to move
to an old folks' home

08:58.727 --> 09:00.524
and who knows
what'll happen to you.

09:00.687 --> 09:02.518
You'll probably be sent
to a foster home

09:02.687 --> 09:05.838
in some Midwestern state
like Manitoba or...

09:06.007 --> 09:08.316
Wait. No, that's not a state,
that's a province.

09:08.487 --> 09:10.637
Oh, no, Arnold!
You'll be a Canadian!

09:10.807 --> 09:14.959
- Grandpa, I'm serious.
- I know, but we're not cooked yet.

09:15.127 --> 09:17.482
Whatever happens, we'll all be OK,

09:17.647 --> 09:19.524
even if we have to become Canadians.

09:19.687 --> 09:22.440
They have very good bacon there.

09:25.567 --> 09:29.480
Canadian. Bacon. This thing on?
Come on, Arnold. Work with me.

09:29.647 --> 09:31.399
Goodnight, Grandpa.

09:31.567 --> 09:35.082
- Goodnight, Grandma.
- Go, team!

09:47.007 --> 09:48.326
Awesome!

09:49.967 --> 09:51.286
Release.

09:54.327 --> 09:57.524
- What's going on?
- You must be a sound sleeper.

09:57.687 --> 09:59.757
They've been hammering
on it all morning.

09:59.927 --> 10:01.645
- Look!
- Willikers!

10:01.807 --> 10:04.526
- It's so wicked awesome.
- It's not awesome.

10:04.687 --> 10:08.566
It's terrible. Read it. We've got
30 days to save the neighborhood.

10:08.727 --> 10:10.638
Look, it's that Scheck fella.

10:10.807 --> 10:15.403
<i>It's time for a new world.</i>
<i>Out with the old, in with the new.</i>

10:15.567 --> 10:19.276
<i>I have seen the future</i>
<i>and it's Future Tech Industries.</i>

10:19.447 --> 10:21.802
He sure gives me the willies.

10:21.967 --> 10:24.356
But he looks good in a suit.

10:24.527 --> 10:27.405
- Gerald.
- I know. I'm just saying.

10:27.567 --> 10:29.205
Come on!

10:52.567 --> 10:53.886
Monkeyman!

10:56.887 --> 11:00.721
Yeah, six days to go,
and then sayonara, suckers!

11:00.887 --> 11:05.881
Six days. Enough time to try
maybe one last big thing.

11:06.047 --> 11:08.402
- But what?
- How about a party?

11:08.567 --> 11:11.081
You always throw the most
<i>outr√©</i> parties, Arnold.

11:11.247 --> 11:14.478
Yeah, a party. A block party.
With music and food.

11:14.647 --> 11:17.525
- And finger sandwiches.
- And food!

11:17.687 --> 11:21.077
We'll have a concert so loud
we'll get on the news.

11:21.247 --> 11:24.239
Then people would get excited and
the mayor will have to change her mind.

11:24.407 --> 11:26.716
And she'll stop the bulldozers.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.559
What do we call it?

11:28.727 --> 11:31.287
Save the Neighborhood
Debutante Ball.

11:31.447 --> 11:32.800
Block Power, baby.

11:32.967 --> 11:35.117
- Blockenanny.
- Block Till You Drop.

11:35.287 --> 11:37.676
It's a Block Thing.
Y'all wouldn't know.

11:37.847 --> 11:39.997
A Block Party... Party?

11:40.167 --> 11:43.443
- How about Blockapalooza?
- Yeah!

11:43.607 --> 11:47.441
- Blockapalooza.
- This Saturday is the day.

11:47.607 --> 11:51.077
- Blockapalooza!
- Get your tickets while they're hot!

11:51.247 --> 11:55.286
"Save the neighborhood"?
"Blockapalooza"? This we don't need.

11:55.447 --> 11:58.200
It's Nick. I think we got a problem.

12:23.327 --> 12:26.000
Blockapalooza, hah! Please.

12:27.247 --> 12:31.035
It's called Blockapalooza,
a last-ditch effort to save

12:31.207 --> 12:33.880
a forgotten neighborhood
from the wrecking ball.

12:34.047 --> 12:38.165
A classic story of the little guy
pitted against the corporate giant.

12:38.327 --> 12:42.559
- They'll mess up the deal!
- Forget it. It's all taken care of.

12:42.727 --> 12:45.639
<i>This is our last chance to stand up</i>

12:45.807 --> 12:48.367
<i>and tell Future Tech Industries</i>
<i>we won't sell.</i>

12:48.527 --> 12:51.405
<i>We won't let 'em tear down</i>
<i>our neighborhood.</i>

12:51.567 --> 12:55.355
We intercepted their permit,
making the whole assemblage illegal.

13:02.327 --> 13:04.443
Go, go, go.

13:07.167 --> 13:09.920
- What's going on?
- This whole assemblage is illegal.

13:10.087 --> 13:14.160
- But we filed a permit.
- We never got any permit.

13:17.727 --> 13:20.878
<i>Disperse from this area at once.</i>

13:21.447 --> 13:23.961
- Grandma?
- Bring on your worst.

13:24.127 --> 13:27.881
- We shall not be moved.
- Come on. Nice and easy.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.761
Stop! That's a frail old lady.

13:31.927 --> 13:34.487
Never give up. Never give in.

13:34.647 --> 13:39.084
Save the neighborhood.
One if by land, two if by sea.

13:39.247 --> 13:42.922
Put the lime in the coconut.
Mix it all up.

13:50.927 --> 13:54.476
Well, that's it.
This place belongs to Scheck now.

13:54.647 --> 13:57.366
They've got the cops
on their side. I give up.

13:57.527 --> 14:00.246
Me too. I'm selling my place.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.762
Goodbye, old neighborhood.
I'll miss you.

14:02.927 --> 14:04.246
Selling?

14:04.407 --> 14:07.285
I'll go try
and get Grandma out of jail.

14:07.447 --> 14:12.760
- Then we'd better get packing.
- We can't give up. It's not over.

14:12.927 --> 14:17.603
That Scheck character has us
covered from every angle, short man.

14:17.767 --> 14:20.235
Wait! Where are you all going?

14:21.087 --> 14:24.079
Come back. Come back.

14:24.247 --> 14:31.358
<i>Out with the old, in with the new.</i>
<i>I've seen the future. Change is good.</i>

14:39.767 --> 14:41.644
Only two more days.

14:41.807 --> 14:44.685
There's gotta be some way
to stop the bulldozers.

14:44.847 --> 14:46.883
There's nothing more we can do.

14:47.047 --> 14:50.642
Face it. In two days,
this neighborhood is coming down

14:50.807 --> 14:53.640
and we'll just have to move on.

14:55.527 --> 14:58.644
I just want to do something.
Baby carriage!

14:58.807 --> 15:02.163
I see it. Saving the neighborhood
isn't a game.

15:02.327 --> 15:06.206
It's real life. And in real life,
you can't always win.

15:08.487 --> 15:13.561
I can win Runaway Bus every time
but that's because it's a game.

15:13.727 --> 15:18.517
- I guess.
- You did your best, buddy.

15:27.607 --> 15:29.518
What are you guys doing?

15:29.687 --> 15:32.076
Just looking at a piece of history.

15:32.247 --> 15:36.081
Four years ago, we made
these handprints in the cement.

15:36.247 --> 15:38.397
"Sid and Stink."

15:38.567 --> 15:41.525
- Sid and Stink?
- It only says Stink

15:41.687 --> 15:45.202
because just when
I was fixing to write the Y,

15:45.367 --> 15:49.485
Sid's old man came along,
and we had to hightail it.

15:49.647 --> 15:52.525
I always thought
that made it even cooler.

15:52.687 --> 15:56.600
We thought it'd be there forever, but
after they tear down the neighborhood,

15:56.767 --> 15:59.122
I reckon nobody'll even remember.

15:59.287 --> 16:00.686
Yeah.

16:09.487 --> 16:13.366
- Hi, Mr Green.
- Look, that was me, aged four.

16:13.527 --> 16:16.200
My grandfather did it.
He was proud of me.

16:16.367 --> 16:20.599
He used to say, "One day,
Green Meats will be your shop."

16:20.767 --> 16:26.478
<i>Sure enough, my father took it over</i>
<i>and then he passed it on to me.</i>

16:26.647 --> 16:30.401
<i>That was the proudest day of my life.</i>

16:31.127 --> 16:35.439
<i>I always knew one day I'd pass</i>
<i>the shop on to my own son.</i>

16:35.967 --> 16:39.801
I guess now that's never gonna happen.

16:40.607 --> 16:43.280
Because they're tearing
down the neighborhood?

16:43.447 --> 16:47.201
No. Because my son hates meat.
He's a vegetarian.

16:47.367 --> 16:49.323
We haven't spoken in years.

16:50.407 --> 16:55.242
Still, I never thought I'd be
the last Green to run Green Meats.

16:55.407 --> 17:01.516
Another couple of days,
it's all gonna be just a pile of bricks.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.598
Excuse me, Arnold.

17:12.926 --> 17:14.758
- Grandma?
- Still in jail.

17:14.926 --> 17:18.521
- I thought it was just one night.
- She keeps trying to escape.

17:18.686 --> 17:22.156
Thinks it's a game.
Fourth time they put her back.

17:35.327 --> 17:37.204
Hi. Have you seen Grandpa?

17:37.367 --> 17:41.042
Oh, Arnold. We may never
see each other again.

17:42.167 --> 17:45.523
Mr Hyunh, can I help you
clean out your refrigiterator?

17:51.367 --> 17:54.916
- Grandpa, what are you doing?
- Packing your stuff.

17:55.087 --> 17:56.839
You haven't sold the house yet.

17:57.007 --> 18:00.716
It's only a matter of time.
Everyone else has sold.

18:00.887 --> 18:05.085
Scheck owns the whole block now,
except for us. I have to sell.

18:05.247 --> 18:07.966
- I can't believe this.
- Me neither.

18:08.127 --> 18:09.924
I was born in this house.

18:10.087 --> 18:13.841
My dad got it in the 1890s,
over a hundred years ago.

18:14.007 --> 18:18.478
Won it in a card game from a man his
dad had fought in the Tomato Incident.

18:18.647 --> 18:22.003
- The Tomato Incident?
- Yes, the Tomato Incident.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.362
Now, that was a good story.

18:24.527 --> 18:28.406
<i>The Yanks won rights</i>
<i>to this land after the Pig War.</i>

18:28.567 --> 18:31.445
<i>But we still paid</i>
<i>taxes to the British</i>

18:31.607 --> 18:35.680
<i>on all sorts of goods, including</i>
<i>tobacco, meats and vegetables.</i>

18:35.847 --> 18:39.442
<i>The whole town was in a snit</i>
<i>over a new tomato tax.</i>

18:39.607 --> 18:42.485
<i>The Brits were adding a nickel</i>
<i>on every tomato.</i>

18:42.647 --> 18:45.366
<i>People were spoiling for a fight.</i>

18:45.527 --> 18:47.722
- What happened?
- The Tomato Incident.

18:47.887 --> 18:50.162
My grandpa and his neighbors
overturned a cart

18:50.327 --> 18:53.046
of British tomatoes on this very street.

18:53.207 --> 18:56.916
Soldiers were sent to arrest him
by order of the colonial governor,

18:57.087 --> 18:59.442
Archibald Von Scheck.

18:59.607 --> 19:03.077
- Von Scheck?
- I wonder if he's any relation.

19:03.247 --> 19:05.124
Von Scheck's men
attacked the neighborhood

19:05.287 --> 19:07.596
but the locals used
guerrilla warfare.

19:07.767 --> 19:10.156
They made a barricade
of vegetable carts

19:10.327 --> 19:14.525
and fought with whatever they had.
They had lots of tomatoes.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.645
<i>They were British tomatoes,</i>
<i>which were small and hard</i>

19:17.807 --> 19:21.197
<i>and really hurt</i>
<i>if you got hit with one.</i>

19:22.727 --> 19:24.160
Let her rip.

19:25.167 --> 19:30.605
<i>That did it. The redcoats were</i>
<i>in full, ignominious retreat.</i>

19:30.767 --> 19:34.396
That's why we eat
American tomatoes, Arnold.

19:34.567 --> 19:37.764
Although I had one recently
from Chile. Very juicy.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.395
- Did that actually happen?
- Of course.

19:40.567 --> 19:44.401
- I sliced it up and put it in a sandwich.
- No. Don't you see?

19:44.567 --> 19:46.956
- This is our answer.
- Yes!

19:47.127 --> 19:50.437
Juicy tomatoes from Chile.
Why didn't I think of that?

19:50.607 --> 19:52.165
No, the Tomato Incident.

19:52.327 --> 19:55.319
If that battle happened right here,
this whole neighborhood

19:55.487 --> 19:57.205
should be a national landmark.

19:57.367 --> 20:01.645
There probably was a document that
declared this block a historic site once.

20:01.807 --> 20:07.404
Maybe I can find it. I show it to the
mayor, and she'll stop the bulldozers.

20:07.567 --> 20:09.603
They couldn't tear down
these buildings ever!

20:09.767 --> 20:12.327
Mr Green and Mrs Vitello
could keep their shops,

20:12.487 --> 20:14.955
Sid and Stinky's
handprints would stay,

20:15.127 --> 20:18.722
and you, Grandma, and me
could keep living like before.

20:18.887 --> 20:22.800
Nothing would change. Grandpa,
don't sell the boarding house.

20:22.967 --> 20:25.356
I'll find that document
and save the neighborhood.

20:25.527 --> 20:28.087
You're a bold kid. I'm with you!

20:28.247 --> 20:33.116
But you better hurry before the
bulldozers knock down the whole thing.

20:34.647 --> 20:39.641
<i>Change is good. I've seen the future</i>
<i>and the future is FTI.</i>

20:42.527 --> 20:46.805
My Emporium goes here where
we're knocking down these old shops?

20:46.967 --> 20:49.117
- Right.
- That's in the contract?

20:49.287 --> 20:52.040
- Absolutely.
- There's no funny business?

20:52.207 --> 20:57.520
Am I a rat fink? It's all on the up-and-up.
Trust me. All you gotta do is sign.

20:59.127 --> 21:04.963
Big... Bob... Pataki!

21:05.127 --> 21:06.958
Beautiful. It's all settled.

21:07.127 --> 21:10.961
In two days, we'll tear down the old
and make way for the new.

21:11.127 --> 21:15.757
Then all we gotta do is sit back
and watch the moolah roll in.

21:15.927 --> 21:19.840
- You've got a way with words.
- Can I keep the pen?

21:29.327 --> 21:31.682
Oh, Arnold,
another moral dilemma...

21:31.847 --> 21:36.079
Stick with Big Bob and get rich
or find some way to help you,

21:36.247 --> 21:40.160
my beloved, noble Arnold,
whom I have so long adored.

21:40.327 --> 21:44.559
If only I knew what to do.
If only I had a sign.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.558
Perfect.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.922
OK, Arnold, you convinced me.

21:54.087 --> 21:57.636
We find that document, show the
mayor, prove that the neighborhood

21:57.807 --> 22:02.085
is a legal national landmark
and stop the bulldozers.

22:02.247 --> 22:07.560
And we're gonna do it all
in the next 46 hours and 19 minutes.

22:07.727 --> 22:11.117
- Right.
- Should be plenty of time.

22:15.127 --> 22:18.961
Arnold! I mean, watch where
you're going, football head.

22:19.127 --> 22:20.958
Sorry. We're in a hurry.

22:21.127 --> 22:24.164
We've gotta find a document
to save the neighborhood.

22:24.327 --> 22:28.081
If you think you're gonna save it
you're dopier than I thought.

22:28.247 --> 22:29.805
All the papers are signed.

22:29.967 --> 22:33.198
In two days,
this place is gonna be a parking lot.

22:33.367 --> 22:35.278
End of story. Any questions?

22:35.447 --> 22:39.281
Yeah. Do you think you could
lend us bus fare?

22:39.447 --> 22:43.918
- We're a little short, Helga.
- It's like I'm living in Loser City.

22:44.087 --> 22:47.397
Since my dad's Super Emporium
is gonna be built

22:47.567 --> 22:51.196
on the ashes of your old lives,
and I'm gonna get rich,

22:51.367 --> 22:54.484
I guess I can give you
change for the bus.

22:54.647 --> 22:55.966
Thanks.

22:56.127 --> 23:00.006
Good luck.
You're gonna need it, losers.

23:00.167 --> 23:02.886
Where are we going?

23:03.047 --> 23:06.323
To the one person
that can help us: Mr Bailey.

23:06.487 --> 23:10.765
- At the Federal Office of Information?
- Right. I know he can help us.

23:11.407 --> 23:15.446
I can't help you.
C-A-N, apostrophe, T. Can't.

23:15.607 --> 23:17.325
But this is important.

23:17.487 --> 23:20.843
So is my job.
Look at all this work I got.

23:21.007 --> 23:25.842
I have no time to check on a document
that was probably lost 50 years ago.

23:26.007 --> 23:29.204
Leave me alone. I don't know
how you got in here anyway.

23:29.367 --> 23:33.360
But if we don't find that document,
everything's gonna be torn down:

23:33.527 --> 23:36.485
Mr Green's butcher shop,
Mrs Vitello's flower shop.

23:36.647 --> 23:38.638
The video store, the arcade.

23:38.807 --> 23:41.765
How many ways can I say it?
I can't help you.

23:41.927 --> 23:44.566
Bowling alley. Slausen's ice cream.

23:44.727 --> 23:48.117
- I don't want to lose my patience.
- Dolly's Donuts.

23:48.287 --> 23:52.963
- Dolly's Donuts?
- Yeah. That great donut shop.

23:53.127 --> 23:56.563
- What did you say?
- Just that it's a shame

23:56.727 --> 23:59.287
they're gonna tear down
Dolly's Donuts.

23:59.447 --> 24:03.520
Yeah. Dolly's Donuts.
Two days from now, they're history.

24:03.687 --> 24:06.485
No more Dolly's Donuts, Mr Bailey.

24:06.647 --> 24:10.401
But I love those donuts.
Nobody makes a cruller like Dolly.

24:10.567 --> 24:15.402
I've been going to Dolly's every day for
30 years. I couldn't survive without 'em.

24:15.567 --> 24:20.357
How can they tear down an institution
like Dolly's? That's just savage.

24:20.527 --> 24:26.124
- I know. But, hey, what can you do?
- Right. See you, Mr Bailey.

24:26.287 --> 24:29.996
Where are you going?
You want to save your neighborhood?

24:30.167 --> 24:33.159
Come on, then.
We've got a document to find.

24:46.847 --> 24:50.157
This is it. When the computer stops,
it'll spit out a card

24:50.327 --> 24:52.443
telling us everything the system knows

24:52.607 --> 24:55.405
about where
your tomato document is.

24:57.007 --> 25:00.841
"The location of your document
is unknown."

25:01.007 --> 25:02.725
I'm sorry, boys.

25:02.887 --> 25:06.800
- It's all right. Thanks for your help.
- You did your best.

25:09.167 --> 25:10.998
What do we do now?

25:11.167 --> 25:15.843
It's probably not worth mentioning,
but I know a guy, the city coroner...

25:16.007 --> 25:19.238
He's kind of, well, a nut.

25:19.407 --> 25:21.477
But he's a well-known history buff

25:21.647 --> 25:25.276
and keeps all kinds of records
on old historical papers.

25:25.447 --> 25:27.517
- Maybe he could help you.
- Where is he?

25:31.607 --> 25:35.316
They look like they're closed.
Let's come back later.

25:35.487 --> 25:38.479
- We don't have time. Come on.
- You first.

25:41.047 --> 25:42.765
Hello?

25:56.247 --> 26:00.160
Hello! I was just taking a nap.
Did I scare you?

26:01.047 --> 26:04.164
I scare most people.
Not intentionally, you understand.

26:04.327 --> 26:10.243
Just the nature of the job.
Anyhoo, what can I do for you?

26:10.407 --> 26:14.036
The Tomato Incident
did indeed happen.

26:14.207 --> 26:20.077
In fact, it was a major historical
turning point in the birth of the country.

26:20.247 --> 26:21.965
What about the document?

26:22.647 --> 26:26.606
There was, as I recall, a document
stating that your neighborhood

26:26.767 --> 26:30.077
was officially declared
a national landmark.

26:30.247 --> 26:33.603
Not an especially well-known document,
but official nonetheless.

26:33.767 --> 26:39.524
And I just may have a file on it.
I keep my historical records in here.

26:39.687 --> 26:41.279
Wrong drawer.

26:43.847 --> 26:45.963
Here we go. Tomato Incident...

26:46.127 --> 26:48.721
Tomato Incident, Tomato Incident,
Tomato, Tomato, Tomato.

26:48.887 --> 26:50.764
Tomato Incident! Here it is.

26:50.927 --> 26:53.839
According to my records,
there was a document

26:54.007 --> 26:58.717
detailing the official status of your
neighborhood as a national landmark.

26:58.887 --> 27:01.526
- What happened to it?
- Let's see.

27:01.687 --> 27:05.646
It was contained in a collection
of local historical papers

27:05.807 --> 27:11.723
which were sold at auction five years
ago to a private corporation.

27:12.127 --> 27:16.040
There's no record of a name,
but there is an address.

27:16.767 --> 27:21.921
66613 Riverside Highway.

27:22.807 --> 27:26.561
It's out on the peninsula.

27:30.767 --> 27:32.325
Going to the peninsula?

27:32.487 --> 27:35.797
Don't talk to the driver
while the bus is in motion.

27:35.967 --> 27:41.166
- But the bus isn't in motion.
- Now it is. Get behind the yellow line.

27:45.847 --> 27:49.920
66590, 66600.
We're close, Gerald.

27:59.407 --> 28:01.523
Future Tech Industries.

28:01.687 --> 28:04.520
- Future Tech Industries?
- They've got the document?

28:06.247 --> 28:11.162
Future Tech has the document that
could save the neighborhood.

28:11.327 --> 28:13.841
- Now what?
- We'll talk to Mr Scheck.

28:14.007 --> 28:17.044
You can't talk to Mr Scheck
without an appointment.

28:17.207 --> 28:20.165
- Then we'll make one.
- He doesn't make appointments.

28:21.447 --> 28:23.915
All righty, then. Have a nice day.

28:24.087 --> 28:25.759
Right. Goodbye.

28:32.327 --> 28:35.285
- There's cameras everywhere.
- I think they're watching us.

28:37.887 --> 28:41.277
Man, this is creepy.
Let's get away from here.

28:43.767 --> 28:45.962
- Security?
- <i>Yes, Mr Scheck?</i>

28:46.127 --> 28:50.166
<i>There are two boys in the hallway,</i>
<i>40 feet from your security desk.</i>

28:50.327 --> 28:53.524
- <i>What? Sir, I...</i>
- Apprehend them

28:53.687 --> 28:55.564
and bring them to my office.

28:55.727 --> 28:59.356
<i>Life is just a bowl of cherries</i>

29:05.287 --> 29:07.676
We found these boys
wandering the halls unescorted.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.645
- Without security clearance?
- That's right, sir.

29:10.807 --> 29:12.479
This is serious, isn't it?

29:12.647 --> 29:16.083
We can't have young boys wandering
around Future Tech Industries

29:16.247 --> 29:18.841
unescorted without security
clearance, now, can we?

29:19.007 --> 29:21.202
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

29:21.367 --> 29:24.245
And these small boys
just snuck past security

29:24.407 --> 29:27.843
and wandered about the building
unescorted. Right?

29:28.007 --> 29:31.317
- Yes, sir.
- Who's responsible for that?

29:31.487 --> 29:33.205
Aren't you head of security?

29:33.367 --> 29:36.359
- Sir, yes, sir.
- "Sir. Yes, sir."

29:36.527 --> 29:39.803
- Is that all you can say?
- No, sir. I mean, yes, sir.

29:39.967 --> 29:44.199
There he goes again.
Why don't you just go now.

29:44.367 --> 29:46.642
Go back to being head of security.

29:46.807 --> 29:51.278
How many others are wandering
around Future Tech unescorted

29:51.447 --> 29:56.521
while you stand here like a big,
dumb stiff repeating "Sir, yes, sir."

29:56.687 --> 29:58.484
Yes, sir!

29:59.607 --> 30:02.963
What can you do with him?
He's like a wind-up doll.

30:03.127 --> 30:05.516
"Yes, sir. Sir, yes, sir."

30:05.687 --> 30:09.282
I'll tell you, it's hard
to get good help nowadays.

30:09.447 --> 30:12.519
It must be upsetting to be
dragged unceremoniously

30:12.687 --> 30:15.918
into my office like this,
but I can't have boys

30:16.087 --> 30:19.602
wandering the halls of my company
unescorted. You understand?

30:19.767 --> 30:21.758
My name is Scheck.
Who are you?

30:21.927 --> 30:25.397
We live in the neighborhood
you want to tear down.

30:25.567 --> 30:28.798
- That I'm going to tear down.
- We heard there's a document

30:28.967 --> 30:33.119
saying it's a national landmark
and can't be torn down by anybody.

30:33.287 --> 30:36.996
I've heard about that, too.
I had my people investigate.

30:37.167 --> 30:40.682
You know what they found?
The document doesn't exist.

30:40.847 --> 30:43.600
The whole thing's
just a rumor, bogus.

30:43.767 --> 30:47.840
If there were such a document,
I'd never go through with my plan.

30:48.007 --> 30:52.125
But it must exist. It was
part of a historical paper collection.

30:52.287 --> 30:55.324
Look, as much
as I admire your thoroughness

30:55.487 --> 31:01.198
and direct approach, the fact remains,
neither you nor I have the document.

31:01.367 --> 31:03.597
So the neighborhood's coming down.
Any questions?

31:03.767 --> 31:07.601
What if we said
we don't buy your story?

31:07.767 --> 31:09.519
Security.

31:12.367 --> 31:13.686
That went well.

31:13.847 --> 31:16.566
Scheck is not a good man.
But he's a natty dresser.

31:27.207 --> 31:30.244
- What's wrong?
- I just had an interesting conversation

31:30.407 --> 31:33.843
with two young boys:
One had a weird stack of hair,

31:34.007 --> 31:35.963
the other was a football-headed kid.

31:36.127 --> 31:40.166
Bob, know anything
about a football-headed kid?

31:40.327 --> 31:43.160
I don't know nothing about
no football-headed kid.

31:43.327 --> 31:47.684
Are you sure? Because
there was one nosing around here

31:47.927 --> 31:51.283
asking about that document.
You know the one I mean.

31:51.447 --> 31:54.359
The document that could
mess up our whole operation?

31:54.527 --> 31:57.883
It's locked in the records room.
Nobody has a key except us.

31:58.047 --> 32:03.599
I haven't seen a kid like that around,
but I will keep my eyes open.

32:05.447 --> 32:08.007
I'm not ready to give up yet.

32:08.167 --> 32:12.604
You're gonna have to face the facts:
There's nothing we can do.

32:12.767 --> 32:16.476
- There's gotta be something.
- It would take a miracle.

32:18.047 --> 32:20.686
- Hello?
- <i>The document you seek exists.</i>

32:20.847 --> 32:23.281
- <i>They're hiding it from you.</i>
- Who is this?

32:23.447 --> 32:25.278
- <i>Call me Deep Voice.</i>
- Who are you?

32:25.447 --> 32:29.235
<i>I can't say, but I can tell you</i>
<i>that Scheck is up to no good.</i>

32:29.407 --> 32:32.080
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>that can stop him is that document.</i>

32:32.247 --> 32:35.364
- <i>How do you know about it?</i>
- Let's just say I know.

32:35.527 --> 32:39.236
- Where is the document?
- At FTI in a safe deposit box.

32:39.407 --> 32:42.126
- Nick Vermicelli has the key.
- But how?

32:42.287 --> 32:45.199
<i>Follow Nick and you'll find the key.</i>
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

32:45.367 --> 32:47.517
<i>But wait! Who are you?</i>

32:47.687 --> 32:54.957
That is too freaky. I'm sorry I ever
doubted you. I'm in. What's the plan?

32:55.127 --> 32:58.756
We find Nick Vermicelli.
Then we spy on him,

32:58.927 --> 33:03.045
until we find out where he's hiding
the key to the safe deposit box.

33:03.207 --> 33:08.235
We steal the key, sneak in to FTI
and get the document.

33:08.407 --> 33:10.477
We evade the security guards,

33:10.647 --> 33:14.686
then all we have to do is
deliver the document to the mayor,

33:14.847 --> 33:18.317
who declares the neighborhood
a landmark and stops the bulldozers.

33:18.487 --> 33:20.762
Arnold, that's a long plan.

33:20.927 --> 33:23.441
I know. But we gotta do it.

33:23.607 --> 33:25.359
We'll need some special equipment.

33:25.527 --> 33:28.997
This may sound crazy,
but I've heard of this girl, Bridget,

33:29.167 --> 33:33.718
who lives across town,
kind of an equipment specialist.

33:36.847 --> 33:40.237
- Is this right?
- It's the address Fuzzy Slippers gave.

33:40.407 --> 33:44.525
- How do you know she'll help?
- Because Bridget helps people.

33:44.687 --> 33:46.564
That's how the legend goes.

33:47.487 --> 33:51.002
- Maybe she's not home.
- What's this button?

33:51.167 --> 33:54.796
- You shouldn't touch that.
- What could happen?

34:03.767 --> 34:10.002
- Which one of you touched my button?
- Me.

34:22.887 --> 34:27.277
If you're gonna save the neighborhood,
you're gonna need some equipment.

34:28.246 --> 34:30.966
State of the art.
Mini condenser microphone

34:31.127 --> 34:32.879
for the ultimate concealed surveillance.

34:33.047 --> 34:34.958
Headphones and micro-radar
tracking dish.

34:35.127 --> 34:39.643
400:1 zoom lens binoculars with
infrared capability for night vision.

34:39.806 --> 34:42.844
High tension, plastic wire, anodized
steel pulleys and nylon straps

34:43.007 --> 34:45.760
for maneuvering in
vertically-challenging situations.

34:45.927 --> 34:48.760
A two-way secure walkie-talkie
for maintaining communication.

34:48.927 --> 34:51.487
And a synchronized, programmable,

34:51.647 --> 34:53.842
glow-in-the-dark watch
set to Greenwich time

34:54.007 --> 34:56.315
and accurate
within 1/10,000th of a second.

34:56.487 --> 35:00.116
It all fits into this cool
AS-47 Junior Secret Agent utility belt.

35:00.287 --> 35:02.198
How much does this cost?

35:02.367 --> 35:05.677
Since it's for a good cause,
it's on the house.

35:05.847 --> 35:10.125
- I figure it's my contribution.
- Great. We'll take two.

35:10.287 --> 35:12.801
- Do they come in other colors?
- Black or pink.

35:12.967 --> 35:15.606
- We'll take black.
- What about this?

35:15.767 --> 35:18.998
- Why do we need a remote-control car?
- You never know.

35:19.167 --> 35:21.522
Whatever you say.

35:27.607 --> 35:30.724
The neighborhood is counting on you.
Good luck, boys.

35:42.727 --> 35:47.323
- What are you doing here?
- Walking, until you knocked me down.

35:47.487 --> 35:49.045
Sorry. We were just...

35:49.207 --> 35:53.405
Out playing your dumb secret agent
game. Aren't you a little old for that?

35:53.567 --> 35:55.444
Come on. We got things to do.

35:55.607 --> 35:58.519
What, some new plan
to save the neighborhood?

35:58.687 --> 36:00.279
- That's right.
- Let's roll.

36:00.447 --> 36:04.076
Take off those lame shades
so you can see where you're walking.

36:04.247 --> 36:08.081
Good luck, Hardy Boys.
You're gonna need it.

36:08.247 --> 36:10.920
Oh, my brave little
football-headed hero

36:11.087 --> 36:12.839
on yet another absurd quest,

36:13.007 --> 36:15.237
to save the only home
you've ever known,

36:15.407 --> 36:20.435
armed with nothing but your best friend
and your sporty utility belt.

36:20.607 --> 36:24.725
Godspeed, my steed,
my only, my love.

36:30.127 --> 36:32.402
This is the place.

36:35.447 --> 36:38.837
Could you open the door?
We need to get out really bad.

36:39.007 --> 36:43.797
- We gotta follow him. He's got a key.
- The bus stops at the corner of 43rd.

36:48.167 --> 36:49.566
Juvenile delinquents.

36:57.487 --> 37:01.526
- We're way under 21.
- Maybe we can get in around back.

37:02.927 --> 37:05.122
<i>Ain't this a great old block</i>

37:05.287 --> 37:08.757
<i>Don't you wish we could</i>
<i>roll back the clock</i>

37:08.927 --> 37:12.237
<i>Oh, the windows we busted</i>
<i>The hubcaps we stole</i>

37:12.407 --> 37:15.558
<i>The apples we boosted</i>
<i>The bums that we rolled</i>

37:15.727 --> 37:18.799
<i>The fun that we had</i>
<i>violating parole</i>

37:18.967 --> 37:23.916
- <i>Ain't this a great old block, Doc</i>
- Got her.

37:24.087 --> 37:27.284
- What are they saying?
- So, is the key safe?

37:27.447 --> 37:29.358
Course it's safe. I got it right here.

37:29.527 --> 37:33.281
Good. We wouldn't want it
to fall into the wrong hands.

37:33.447 --> 37:35.324
They're talking about a key.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.842
Maybe it's the key
Deep Voice mentioned.

37:40.047 --> 37:41.765
<i>Don't worry about the key.</i>

37:42.927 --> 37:44.997
- What key?
- What's goin' on?

37:45.167 --> 37:48.079
- What happened? Did I do that?
- Who's doing that?

37:49.687 --> 37:52.360
This thing on?
Sorry about that, folks.

37:52.527 --> 37:55.678
- <i>Hit it, Tony.</i>
- Get a busboy over here.

37:55.847 --> 38:00.557
Clean this up. Get us more drinks.
Yo, busboys! What are you, deaf?

38:02.047 --> 38:04.845
Clean up this mess
or I'll make you wear it.

38:05.967 --> 38:08.083
Look. The key. It's around his neck.

38:08.247 --> 38:13.002
And get us two more Bartletts.
No ice this time. And no lipstick.

38:13.167 --> 38:18.446
- We'll get those for you right away.
- Right away.

38:18.607 --> 38:21.997
Football-headed kid!

38:23.927 --> 38:26.964
Here's the deal.
The boys are risking their life

38:27.127 --> 38:31.917
with some crazy plan to get a rare
historic document from Scheck

38:32.087 --> 38:33.839
and they don't stand a chance.

38:34.007 --> 38:37.522
We must think of a back-up scheme
that'll bail us out

38:37.687 --> 38:40.247
when their crazy,
lamebrained plan fizzles.

38:40.407 --> 38:45.606
So come on. Think of a plan.
It's got to be smart, logical and feasible.

38:45.767 --> 38:48.725
We could paint the house
with vanishing cream.

38:48.887 --> 38:53.722
- Then it would be invisible.
- That is the stupidest idea ever.

38:53.887 --> 38:57.562
What if it rains? Ding-dong.
You ever think about that?

38:57.727 --> 39:02.482
It'll wash the vanishing cream off,
and then everyone'll see us.

39:02.647 --> 39:07.038
What we gotta do is build a dummy
neighborhood one block over.

39:07.207 --> 39:09.437
You're the dummy.
That will never work!

39:09.607 --> 39:12.679
Yeah? I don't see you
coming up with anything.

39:12.847 --> 39:16.601
Dig a little deeper
into the caverns of your puny mind.

39:16.767 --> 39:19.839
Digging? Caverns?
Hey, wait a minute.

39:20.007 --> 39:24.398
- That reminds me! The secret tunnels!
- What secret tunnels?

39:26.167 --> 39:31.116
Pretty impressive, eh? A network
of tunnels that honeycomb the block

39:31.287 --> 39:33.881
and possibly lead
to the rest of the neighborhood.

39:34.047 --> 39:36.959
I hate it. It's dark, and it smells.

39:37.127 --> 39:39.357
- It's very creepy.
- Let's go back.

39:39.527 --> 39:41.199
Wait, wait. Listen.

39:41.367 --> 39:45.645
One tunnel goes under the street
from our house to the one opposite.

39:45.807 --> 39:49.846
If we wire it with explosives,
we'll blow a hole in the street

39:50.007 --> 39:52.043
that the bulldozers can't cross.

39:52.207 --> 39:56.962
Yeah? Just one little detail.
Where you gonna get the explosives?

39:57.127 --> 40:00.722
From you, of course.
Just go down to your job site

40:00.887 --> 40:04.880
and lift a couple hundred pounds
of explosives when no one's looking.

40:06.487 --> 40:08.762
That's the craziest thing I ever heard,

40:08.927 --> 40:12.886
especially considering
I got twice that much under my bed.

40:13.047 --> 40:15.925
What? We all got
our little peccadilloes.

40:42.167 --> 40:44.806
- Finally.
- Let's hope he's ready for bed.

40:44.967 --> 40:46.764
He should be. It's midnight.

40:46.927 --> 40:51.318
As soon as he's asleep,
we can get the key off him.

40:51.927 --> 40:56.478
As soon as he falls asleep? What
if he keeps watching TV for hours?

40:56.647 --> 40:59.684
Maybe there's nothing good on.

41:00.247 --> 41:02.477
Someone's calling him. Quick!

41:02.647 --> 41:05.923
Last time we nearly got killed
using that thing.

41:06.087 --> 41:08.476
We gotta find out who's calling him.

41:08.647 --> 41:12.242
- It might be a clue.
- All right.

41:14.727 --> 41:18.561
- That's Big Bob.
- Yeah, Bob. You're a full partner.

41:18.727 --> 41:21.036
What're you calling for?
What about your contract?

41:21.207 --> 41:26.520
You got a problem with the contract?
Quit reading it and get some rest.

41:26.687 --> 41:29.679
- Stinkin' pain in the...
- That no-good runt!

41:29.847 --> 41:33.203
"Party of the first part,
party of the second part..."

41:33.367 --> 41:35.278
Yada, yada, yada, yada.

41:35.447 --> 41:37.756
Wait a minute. What the heck!

41:41.367 --> 41:43.756
I think he's finally asleep, Gerald.

41:44.727 --> 41:48.720
Give me that key!
I was just resting my eye.

41:48.887 --> 41:50.718
- Time to go in.
- Wait.

41:50.887 --> 41:52.798
You're not gonna hang from that?

41:52.967 --> 41:55.765
- Not unless you want to.
- It's not my size.

42:12.327 --> 42:15.125
No problem. I'll fix it.

42:16.007 --> 42:18.885
Come on.
Almost there. You can do it.

42:19.047 --> 42:21.607
What is that? Who's going?

42:27.807 --> 42:30.480
It's an angel.

42:48.487 --> 42:52.241
- <i>Good job getting the key.</i>
- Deep Voice. Where are you?

42:52.407 --> 42:55.126
<i>Never mind.</i>
<i>I'm watching all your movements.</i>

42:55.287 --> 42:58.040
I'm everywhere and nowhere,
but mostly I'm everywhere.

42:58.207 --> 43:01.085
Come on,
cut the voodoo dolly mumbo jumbo.

43:01.247 --> 43:03.124
Why must you be so mysterious?

43:03.287 --> 43:06.597
You seem confused
about who's calling the shots. I am.

43:06.767 --> 43:09.565
<i>Without me,</i>
<i>you'll never get the document.</i>

43:09.727 --> 43:13.515
You must get into Scheck's office.
His safe deposits are behind his desk.

43:13.687 --> 43:18.078
- We have to get back into his office?
- Only this time, don't get caught.

43:18.247 --> 43:21.796
<i>Find a way to distract security</i>
<i>away from the main entrance.</i>

43:21.967 --> 43:25.642
Now, it's exactly two a.m.
The bulldozers roll at seven.

43:25.807 --> 43:27.525
What are you waiting for?

43:28.167 --> 43:31.125
Man, that Deep Voice
is a pain in the...

43:33.527 --> 43:35.358
Come on.

43:35.527 --> 43:37.438
It's us. How you been?

43:37.607 --> 43:41.077
So it's the two juvenile delinquents
who busted my door.

43:41.247 --> 43:45.286
Think you can make up your own rules,
come and go as you please?

43:45.447 --> 43:47.802
Couple of renaissance men.

43:47.967 --> 43:52.199
- Sorry about that.
- But we're kinda in a hurry... Murray.

43:52.367 --> 43:56.042
Don't talk to the driver
while the vehicle's in motion.

43:57.207 --> 43:59.437
The stinkin' bus is fallin' apart.

44:01.087 --> 44:04.124
I know we're not supposed
to talk to you,

44:04.287 --> 44:06.164
but could you drive a little faster?

44:06.327 --> 44:10.161
I drive 25 miles an hour,
no exceptions, no discussion.

44:10.327 --> 44:13.524
- I wonder what bee got in his boxers.
- You'd have one too

44:13.687 --> 44:15.279
if you were in my moccasins.

44:15.447 --> 44:19.122
My girlfriend left me two weeks ago.
Her name is Mona.

44:21.287 --> 44:25.838
- She said she wanted a whole man.
- What's that mean?

44:26.007 --> 44:31.479
I lost the real one in the war.
She thought it was cool at first.

44:31.647 --> 44:35.276
In walks Johnny Come Lately
and I'm out the doggie door.

44:35.447 --> 44:39.759
You meet a girl. You think it's forever,
then the whole thing goes kablooey.

44:39.927 --> 44:42.964
She broke my heart,
and although I still love her,

44:43.127 --> 44:47.279
I made up my mind that from now on,
I ain't gonna care about nothin'

44:47.447 --> 44:49.517
or stick my neck out for nobody.

44:49.687 --> 44:54.636
- I'm only looking out for number one.
- That was an inspiring story.

44:54.807 --> 44:58.163
Isn't there another bus
we can take to FTI?

45:19.647 --> 45:23.686
Those cameras detect any motion.
If we move, they'll see us.

45:23.847 --> 45:26.236
This is no time
for playing with toy cars.

45:26.407 --> 45:28.716
I'm not playing, Gerald.

45:38.927 --> 45:40.485
What was that?

45:40.647 --> 45:44.037
We can get to Scheck's office
this way. Come on.

45:50.887 --> 45:54.243
Deep Voice said to look
in the room behind his desk.

46:03.607 --> 46:05.199
What are you waiting for?

46:12.887 --> 46:14.320
We'd better get started.

46:23.647 --> 46:26.161
That's the last of it, Gramps.

46:26.327 --> 46:29.239
Now all we do
is run this wire up to the street

46:29.407 --> 46:31.682
and wait for the bulldozers to come.

46:31.847 --> 46:35.283
Then we blow a huge hole,
and they fall right in.

46:35.447 --> 46:38.280
Sounds great.
Now, let's get out of here.

46:38.447 --> 46:40.802
Yes, it is still very creepy.

46:49.807 --> 46:52.401
Wake up!
I've just read the fine print.

46:52.567 --> 46:56.401
So it's Scheck's Beeper Emporium, is it?
You're trying to double-cross me.

46:56.567 --> 46:59.400
- I don't know what you mean.
- I read the contract!

46:59.567 --> 47:03.924
I get a new Beeper Emporium,
but Scheck gets 51% of my company!

47:04.087 --> 47:07.477
It's true, but you signed a contract.
There's nothing you can do.

47:07.647 --> 47:10.002
- The ink's dry.
- You were in on it!

47:10.167 --> 47:14.399
- You knew he was gonna shaft me!
- So what? It's a free country.

47:14.567 --> 47:19.322
If it's a free country, I guess I'm free
to beat the living snot out of ya!

47:19.487 --> 47:22.559
- Bob, don't get crazy.
- Too late!

48:06.447 --> 48:11.840
The key. What happened?
Oh, no. That dream I had, that angel...

48:12.007 --> 48:15.363
That wasn't no angel.
It was that football-headed kid!

48:15.527 --> 48:20.726
It was really happening!
He must've stole the stinkin' key!

48:20.887 --> 48:22.878
Yeah, Mr Scheck, it's me, Nick.

48:23.047 --> 48:25.515
Bad news. I think I lost the key.

48:25.687 --> 48:29.999
Yeah, the key. I think
that football-headed kid took it.

48:30.167 --> 48:33.204
I was asleep.
I think he snuck in and stole it.

48:33.367 --> 48:35.597
Yeah, I know.
I'm stupid, stupid.

48:35.767 --> 48:38.440
997.

48:38.607 --> 48:40.962
998.

48:42.727 --> 48:44.957
999.

48:47.287 --> 48:49.357
- Empty?
- Where's the document?

48:49.527 --> 48:53.440
Looking for something?
Here you are, back again.

48:53.607 --> 48:57.202
After I'd patiently explained
that your mission is hopeless.

48:57.367 --> 49:00.086
It still is,
though I'm less inclined to entertain you

49:00.247 --> 49:02.442
after you broke into my building again.

49:02.607 --> 49:04.723
You thought
you could get away with this?

49:04.887 --> 49:08.323
There are cameras everywhere.
I record everything that goes on.

49:08.487 --> 49:12.036
Did you think I'd let
you save your little neighborhood?

49:12.207 --> 49:15.995
Don't you realize who I am?
Alphonse Perrier De Von Scheck.

49:16.167 --> 49:18.806
I can trace my ancestry
to the founding fathers.

49:18.967 --> 49:21.197
Do you know when we lost control
of this city?

49:21.367 --> 49:25.360
When that ridiculous Tomato Incident
took place in your neighborhood.

49:25.527 --> 49:30.442
Tearing it down and putting my name in
its place will be the sweetest revenge.

49:30.607 --> 49:33.360
But the document.
Where's the document?

49:33.527 --> 49:38.442
Unfortunately, like your little plan,
it's about to go up in smoke.

49:44.247 --> 49:48.843
My guards will now lock you away
where you won't cause more trouble.

49:57.487 --> 49:58.806
Run!

50:00.407 --> 50:04.002
Get them, for heaven's sake.

50:08.247 --> 50:09.839
They went thataway. Come on.

50:13.207 --> 50:14.640
There they are!

50:14.807 --> 50:17.685
I'll lose them on the stairway.
Head for the garage.

50:17.847 --> 50:20.566
Find a way out.
Call me on the walkie.

50:35.927 --> 50:37.519
<i>Arnold, what happened?</i>

50:37.687 --> 50:39.962
- Where are you?
- <i>Where's the document?</i>

50:40.127 --> 50:42.402
- Scheck burned it.
- Burned it?

50:42.567 --> 50:45.206
Right in front of us.
He laughed at us.

50:45.367 --> 50:48.006
He said we never had a chance.
He's gonna win.

50:48.167 --> 50:51.000
- Don't give up.
- Why not? It's over.

50:51.167 --> 50:53.078
It's not. There must be something.

50:53.247 --> 50:58.002
- Aren't there any other copies?
- No. He wouldn't make a copy.

50:58.167 --> 51:01.443
There were video cameras
all over the place.

51:01.607 --> 51:04.883
They record everything
that goes on in Scheck's building.

51:05.047 --> 51:08.562
- Scheck said so himself.
- <i>The document must be on videotape.</i>

51:08.727 --> 51:11.321
Get to the room
with the video recorders,

51:11.487 --> 51:13.523
find the tape and catch him
burning the document.

51:13.687 --> 51:15.757
We can show the tape to the police

51:15.927 --> 51:17.804
and it'll be as good
as the document itself.

51:17.967 --> 51:21.926
We can win, Deep Voice.
We can save the neighborhood.

52:26.647 --> 52:28.399
Down here.

52:36.727 --> 52:38.319
What the?

52:49.047 --> 52:51.845
<i>Warning: Intruder, level five.</i>

52:52.007 --> 52:54.840
<i>Warning: Intruder, level five.</i>

53:09.527 --> 53:12.439
- I got it!
- I thought he burned it.

53:12.607 --> 53:17.886
And I got it all on videotape for the
police. It's just as good, maybe better.

53:18.047 --> 53:21.198
I am moved by your greatness.
Get out of there!

53:21.367 --> 53:22.959
I'll wait till the guards are gone.

53:23.127 --> 53:26.563
I'm on the street.
I'll get a cab and meet you out front.

53:26.727 --> 53:29.560
We've got 24 minutes
before the bulldozers roll.

53:29.727 --> 53:33.083
We can make it.
See you in two, Gerald.

53:36.487 --> 53:39.240
<i>Don't go out yet.</i>
<i>It's swarming with guards.</i>

53:39.407 --> 53:41.159
How do you know I'm here?

53:41.327 --> 53:44.558
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>You've got the evidence you need.</i>

53:44.727 --> 53:46.763
<i>We've got to get you out of the building.</i>

53:46.927 --> 53:50.886
- If you're caught now, all is lost.
- How can I get out of here?

53:51.047 --> 53:55.404
Wait until the guards go
to the other side of the building.

53:55.567 --> 53:58.320
I'll distract them,
but it'll only buy you a few minutes.

53:58.487 --> 54:01.047
They're covering the elevators
and the stairs.

54:03.207 --> 54:06.165
Don't come any closer.
Ignore that man with the voice box.

54:06.327 --> 54:08.761
- Who are you?
- No one.

54:08.927 --> 54:12.761
No more games. I'm not doing
anything until I know who you are.

54:16.087 --> 54:18.521
You? You're Deep Voice?

54:18.687 --> 54:21.918
- Looks like it.
- But I don't get it.

54:22.087 --> 54:24.362
Why couldn't you just tell me?

54:24.527 --> 54:27.758
- Why the secret identity?
- No reason.

54:27.927 --> 54:30.760
You just risked everything to help me.

54:30.927 --> 54:34.806
- So? What's your point?
- Pretty amazing thing to do.

54:34.967 --> 54:39.438
- I'm a pretty amazing person.
- I thought you were on your dad's side.

54:39.607 --> 54:42.246
- You were gonna get rich.
- Money isn't everything.

54:42.407 --> 54:45.046
- Why'd you do it?
- It's my civic duty.

54:45.207 --> 54:48.563
- 'Cause I love a good mystery.
- Come on. Why?

54:48.727 --> 54:52.720
I don't know. Maybe I just took pity
on you and your stupid friends.

54:52.887 --> 54:55.162
- Why?
- 'Cause...

54:55.327 --> 54:57.682
...maybe I don't
hate you as much as I thought.

54:57.847 --> 55:02.796
Maybe I even like you a little.
You might even say I like you a lot.

55:02.967 --> 55:04.605
You did this for me?

55:04.767 --> 55:09.557
That's right. What do you do
when someone you love is in trouble?

55:09.727 --> 55:12.924
- Love?
- You heard me. I love you.

55:13.087 --> 55:15.237
Who else has been stalking you,

55:15.407 --> 55:18.479
building shrines to you,
filling books with poems about you?

55:18.647 --> 55:20.524
I love you.
I've always loved you

55:20.687 --> 55:23.360
since I first saw
your stupid football head.

55:23.527 --> 55:26.405
From that moment,
I've lived and breathed for you,

55:26.567 --> 55:29.035
dreamed of telling
you my secret feelings,

55:29.207 --> 55:31.675
and grabbing you and kissing you!

55:31.847 --> 55:33.758
Come here, you big lug!

55:42.327 --> 55:45.364
I'm confused.
Did you just say you loved me?

55:45.527 --> 55:47.085
Are you deaf?

55:47.247 --> 55:49.078
- Not now!
- Not now?

55:49.247 --> 55:51.363
Oh, Arnold, just hold me.

55:51.527 --> 55:57.716
- I need to think.
- Do the thinking for both of us now.

55:57.887 --> 56:02.483
This is all happening too fast.
I feel dizzy. I need to lie down.

56:02.647 --> 56:05.115
- Wonderful. I'll go with you.
- No.

56:05.287 --> 56:09.565
There's no time. We've got
20 minutes before the bulldozers roll.

56:09.727 --> 56:11.604
- Bulldozers?
- The neighborhood.

56:11.767 --> 56:15.646
We have to save the neighborhood.
Come on. Let's roll.

56:27.207 --> 56:28.526
Oh no.

56:28.687 --> 56:31.281
I couldn't find a cab. Come on.

56:31.447 --> 56:33.358
- What's she doing here?
- No time to explain.

56:33.527 --> 56:36.883
We got exactly 16 minutes
to stop the bulldozers.

56:37.047 --> 56:38.958
Behind the yellow line.

56:43.047 --> 56:45.686
That football-headed kid
and his little pals

56:45.847 --> 56:48.236
have the document on videotape
and they're headed uptown

56:48.407 --> 56:50.716
on city bus number 13.

56:50.887 --> 56:54.596
- Get 'em!
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

56:54.767 --> 56:57.600
All right, everybody, listen.
There's a bus headed uptown.

56:57.767 --> 57:00.725
<i>Your job is to stop it.</i>

57:03.807 --> 57:09.518
- Couldn't you go a little faster?
- 25 mph. No exceptions, no discussion.

57:09.687 --> 57:12.247
- But lives are at stake.
- Not my problem.

57:12.407 --> 57:15.524
The thing is, Murray,
we're in a hurry.

57:15.687 --> 57:19.396
A neighborhood's about to be
torn down and we can stop 'em.

57:19.567 --> 57:22.001
We have to get there in 14 minutes.

57:22.167 --> 57:24.203
I'll get you there
when I get you there,

57:24.367 --> 57:28.076
which, according to my schedule,
will be in about 44 minutes.

57:28.247 --> 57:31.922
- That'll be too late.
- We have to get there in 14 minutes.

57:32.087 --> 57:35.443
Then you're gonna have
to sprout wings and fly.

57:35.607 --> 57:38.963
- Don't you wanna save people's homes?
- Not my problem.

57:39.127 --> 57:41.721
Don't you care that every building
from 33rd to 39th Street

57:41.887 --> 57:43.479
will be demolished?

57:43.647 --> 57:46.320
- 33rd to 39th Street?
- Right.

57:46.487 --> 57:49.718
That's where Mona lives.

57:49.887 --> 57:53.675
Hang on to your goodies.
We got a neighborhood to save.

58:04.247 --> 58:06.363
- Is there anything we can do?
- Yeah.

58:06.527 --> 58:08.677
Pray this hunk of junk

58:08.847 --> 58:12.601
holds together long enough
to get us uptown in one piece.

58:22.807 --> 58:25.924
- Where's Arnold?
- Look!

58:27.767 --> 58:29.883
- In position.
- Do it.

58:30.047 --> 58:32.322
Roger that.

58:38.807 --> 58:42.004
- I didn't know you were religious.
- Neither did I.

59:02.287 --> 59:04.243
His fake leg's stuck. I can't budge it.

59:04.407 --> 59:06.523
Gerald, you'll have to drive.

59:06.687 --> 59:08.405
- Him?
- Are you crazy?

59:08.567 --> 59:12.162
You're the top-scoring Runaway Bus
player at the arcade.

59:12.327 --> 59:15.046
That's a game. This is real life.

59:15.207 --> 59:17.482
I know you can do it.

59:17.647 --> 59:21.162
Why do you always
have to look on the bright side?

59:21.327 --> 59:23.682
"We can save the neighborhood
and find the document."

59:23.847 --> 59:26.520
- "You can drive the bus."
- Somebody has to.

59:26.687 --> 59:29.599
Get on the floor. You too, Helga.

59:29.767 --> 59:33.203
- Why?
- Because I'm driving the bus, OK?

59:33.367 --> 59:36.404
And because I'm nine,
and I can't reach the pedals.

59:36.567 --> 59:40.560
Arnold, you work the clutch.
Helga, you work the brakes.

59:40.727 --> 59:45.278
And try to get Murray's
fake leg off the stinking gas pedal!

59:57.487 --> 59:59.443
Brake!

01:00:06.287 --> 01:00:08.278
My cans!

01:00:08.447 --> 01:00:09.766
Clutch!

01:00:19.967 --> 01:00:25.041
<i>You take the high road</i>
<i>and I'll take the low road</i>

01:00:37.647 --> 01:00:39.956
What are those guys up to?

01:00:40.847 --> 01:00:42.519
- Is the overpass wired?
- Yes.

01:00:42.687 --> 01:00:46.475
- Blow it.
- Boss, this is pretty serious.

01:00:46.647 --> 01:00:49.764
- Serious?
- As in 15 to life.

01:00:49.927 --> 01:00:52.885
Just do it, you incompetent moron!

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:17.682
All right. It's seven o'clock.
Time to take it all down.

01:01:27.287 --> 01:01:31.803
- Why'd I eat chilli for breakfast?
- Easy, Gramps. Don't blow yet.

01:01:31.967 --> 01:01:34.686
As soon as I push down this plunger,

01:01:34.847 --> 01:01:37.759
we'll commence
Operation Stop the Bulldozer.

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:43.445
What's goin' on? 286-DX plunger,
high-gauge wire, C-47 tubing.

01:01:43.607 --> 01:01:46.326
I know, you're planning
to blow the street up,

01:01:46.487 --> 01:01:50.082
make a hole big enough
to stop the bulldozers.

01:01:50.247 --> 01:01:53.557
- You could do serious jail time.
- Well, I...

01:01:53.727 --> 01:01:55.604
You need any help?

01:02:01.807 --> 01:02:04.002
- We can't make it!
- Let's jump out.

01:02:04.167 --> 01:02:07.603
No. Use the truck.
We can jump the hole!

01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:11.043
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard! Let's do it!

01:02:11.207 --> 01:02:14.802
- What happened?
- It's OK. We're jumping the ramp.

01:02:14.967 --> 01:02:16.400
What ramp?

01:02:47.927 --> 01:02:51.636
- What smells so rank?
- Get out.

01:02:58.567 --> 01:03:00.239
- Now what?
- Grandma!

01:03:00.407 --> 01:03:03.604
- What about her? She's in jail.
- She was.

01:03:15.047 --> 01:03:16.446
Yea, Grandma!

01:03:16.607 --> 01:03:18.962
- She's going back to jail.
- I know.

01:03:22.287 --> 01:03:23.845
Hang on!

01:04:03.287 --> 01:04:08.077
- I got it! I got the tape!
- That's wonderful. What tape?

01:04:08.247 --> 01:04:11.284
The tape that'll prove this neighborhood
is a historic landmark

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:13.358
and can never be destroyed.

01:04:13.527 --> 01:04:16.360
All I need is a VCR,
and I can show you.

01:04:16.527 --> 01:04:18.518
- I'm way ahead of you.
- Bridget?

01:04:18.687 --> 01:04:20.120
Up here.

01:04:21.287 --> 01:04:23.118
Tape her.

01:04:27.927 --> 01:04:29.246
Wow.

01:04:30.647 --> 01:04:32.922
Who does she think she is?
Catwoman?

01:04:44.567 --> 01:04:47.320
Oh, my word! That's enough for me.

01:04:47.487 --> 01:04:50.524
As your mayor, I reclaim
this entire neighborhood

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:54.077
as a national historic landmark
never to be torn down.

01:05:02.567 --> 01:05:06.958
It's after seven o'clock. What are you
idiots waiting for? Knock it down!

01:05:10.487 --> 01:05:14.526
It's that lying crook, Scheck!
Come on! Let's get the car!

01:05:14.687 --> 01:05:17.076
I got the hubcap!

01:05:33.287 --> 01:05:37.883
I would've gotten away with it if it
wasn't for that meddling football head,

01:05:38.047 --> 01:05:41.403
the kid with the weird hair
and that one-eyebrowed brat.

01:05:41.567 --> 01:05:44.365
Tell it to the judge,
you big donut-hole!

01:05:45.847 --> 01:05:49.317
Tell it to your cell mate in Folsom.

01:05:54.727 --> 01:05:57.366
- Where are you going?
- I'll make it up to you.

01:05:57.527 --> 01:06:00.883
I'll buy you breakfast.
We'll talk. They have a special.

01:06:01.967 --> 01:06:03.958
Willikers, what a day!

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:07.437
Fistfights, car chases
and political intrigue.

01:06:07.607 --> 01:06:09.643
Don't forget
about the overpass blowin' up!

01:06:09.807 --> 01:06:12.401
And it's only 7.30 in the morning!

01:06:12.567 --> 01:06:17.163
I wanna go back to bed.
I'm exhausted.

01:06:28.127 --> 01:06:30.277
<i>Change is good.</i>
<i>Change is good.</i>

01:06:34.687 --> 01:06:40.045
I thought we set the explosion
down the middle of the street.

01:06:40.207 --> 01:06:41.799
You didn't see nothing. Scatter.

01:06:47.447 --> 01:06:50.325
What happened? We made it!

01:06:51.087 --> 01:06:52.566
Mona?

01:06:53.087 --> 01:06:55.043
You saved the neighborhood!

01:06:55.207 --> 01:06:59.678
You're my hero.
I'm so sorry I made fun of your leg.

01:06:59.847 --> 01:07:03.601
- I don't care. I love you, baby.
- I love you too, Murray.

01:07:03.767 --> 01:07:07.840
I love you just the way you are.

01:07:10.647 --> 01:07:14.720
- Pretty crazy day.
- Yeah, we said a lot of nutty things.

01:07:14.887 --> 01:07:17.355
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:07:17.527 --> 01:07:21.236
About all that stuff I said, Arnold, I...

01:07:21.407 --> 01:07:26.879
- It was crazy back there...
- With all the excitement we just...

01:07:27.047 --> 01:07:30.437
- Got carried away?
- You didn't really mean all that?

01:07:30.607 --> 01:07:32.518
You don't really love me?

01:07:32.687 --> 01:07:35.918
- Right.
- You were caught up in the moment.

01:07:36.087 --> 01:07:40.558
- Right.
- You actually hate me, don't you?

01:07:40.727 --> 01:07:46.518
Of course I hate you, you stupid
football head, and don't ever forget it!

01:07:49.247 --> 01:07:50.566
Yes!

01:07:56.687 --> 01:07:59.201
I guess we did it, Arnold.

01:08:00.727 --> 01:08:04.402
- We saved the neighborhood.
- Yep. Everything's back to normal.

01:08:04.567 --> 01:08:07.206
Shall we go shoot some hoops?

01:08:07.367 --> 01:08:09.756
Gerald, our ball's flat, remember?

01:08:09.927 --> 01:08:13.124
- No. Just a little low on air.
- Wait.

01:08:13.287 --> 01:08:17.758
- You're looking on the bright side?
- Somebody has to.

01:08:19.647 --> 01:08:22.604
<i>We saved our neighborhood</i>

01:08:22.767 --> 01:08:25.679
<i>They could not tear it down</i>

01:08:25.846 --> 01:08:29.157
<i>They could not turn our smile</i>

01:08:29.327 --> 01:08:33.115
- <i>Into a frown</i>
- The show's over, Eugene.
