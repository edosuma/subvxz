WEBVTT

00:00.007 --> 00:04.797
[Laughter]
The Avengers have fallen.

00:05.093 --> 00:09.308
Through the genius of my intellect
and well-calculated plans,

00:09.468 --> 00:11.750
I have subdued
the great Black Widow,

00:11.859 --> 00:16.315
Falcon, Hawkeye, Captain
America, Hulk, and Thor.

00:16.546 --> 00:20.390
And with this device
I'm calling the Static Expander,

00:20.488 --> 00:22.851
I will do away
with them forever!

00:23.039 --> 00:24.356
[growls]

00:24.601 --> 00:28.226
So, what leads you
to believe, Black Panther,

00:28.329 --> 00:30.710
one single man
can stand against

00:30.859 --> 00:33.132
my new and powerful Cabal?

00:33.300 --> 00:37.539
For a man of supposed intellect,
you have much to learn, Leader.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.606
One person can
always make a difference.

00:42.548 --> 00:45.750
Also, you talk too much.

00:46.132 --> 00:47.867
I'll try to be less wordy.

00:47.992 --> 00:51.257
Cabal, destroy him.

01:09.520 --> 01:12.054
[grunting]

01:12.184 --> 01:16.051
He has spirit.
I'll crush it out of him.

01:16.457 --> 01:18.338

01:18.429 --> 01:20.362

[grunts]

01:26.137 --> 01:28.337

01:35.499 --> 01:36.565
Hmm.

[grunting]

01:47.158 --> 01:48.423
[clattering]

01:48.598 --> 01:50.082
Quit toying with him.

01:50.130 --> 01:52.738
Enchantress, finish him.

01:55.408 --> 01:56.574
[yells]

01:59.987 --> 02:02.821
[grunting]

02:06.750 --> 02:09.562
Foolish.
Absolutely foolish.

02:09.618 --> 02:11.641
What could you hope
to accomplish?

02:15.186 --> 02:18.061
Just taking back
the Vibranium you stole.

02:18.122 --> 02:20.644
I gather your device
will not work without it?

02:20.701 --> 02:24.050
What? Stop him!

02:24.691 --> 02:25.832
[Skurge yells]

02:27.164 --> 02:28.253
[grunts]

02:31.422 --> 02:32.977
Going somewhere?

02:33.156 --> 02:36.104
You underestimate
the power of Arnim Zola.

02:36.253 --> 02:39.128
I am stronger than
you could possibly imagine.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.376
You won't get past me.

02:41.914 --> 02:43.539
I am not going past you.

02:43.695 --> 02:45.805
- I am going through you.
- What?

02:45.899 --> 02:49.742
No! What do you think
you're doing?

02:50.274 --> 02:51.422
[grunting]

02:52.242 --> 02:54.122
[grunts]
Aah!

02:55.000 --> 02:56.191
[grunts]

02:56.578 --> 02:59.977
I will easily transfer my
consciousness to another body.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.219
How do you expect
to survive this?

03:02.297 --> 03:04.366
You're going too fast!

03:05.770 --> 03:09.195
Not if I do this.
[grunts] [yells]

03:09.320 --> 03:13.578
You dare?
This ridiculousness won't kill me.

03:13.664 --> 03:16.328
No, but it will hurt.

03:18.438 --> 03:19.481
[grunts]

03:19.914 --> 03:21.625
[screaming]

03:23.360 --> 03:25.120
[screaming continues]
Pepperoni and...

03:25.235 --> 03:26.641
[people gasping, exclaiming]

03:27.269 --> 03:28.641
[grunts]
Wha...

03:33.406 --> 03:36.098
That was awesome!

03:45.492 --> 03:48.023
<i>He managed
to escape my grasp.</i>

03:48.226 --> 03:50.796
<i>But you would not believe
what he had the gall to...</i>

03:51.343 --> 03:54.820
Imbecile.
No wonder Hydra always fails.

03:55.062 --> 03:57.789
I'll retrieve
our escaped Panther.

03:58.062 --> 04:01.156
Send me.
I'll bring back our prey.

04:01.437 --> 04:04.101
And toy with him
while I do it.

04:04.523 --> 04:06.679
Black Panther
is a wounded animal.

04:06.898 --> 04:11.640
To catch a panther, we'll
send our best hunter, Skurge.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.085
To the hunt, with pleasure.

04:22.132 --> 04:24.398
I cannot fight
this battle alone.

04:24.749 --> 04:27.718
My only chance
is with a team.

04:28.867 --> 04:31.031
[grunting]

04:32.007 --> 04:34.648
Now comes the fun.
[grunts]

04:35.640 --> 04:38.193
[grunting]

04:42.562 --> 04:43.843
[laughing]

04:44.124 --> 04:45.976
Here, kitty, kitty.

04:46.062 --> 04:48.036
Need to buy myself
some time.

04:51.304 --> 04:53.866
You can't evade me
forever, mortal.

04:56.228 --> 04:57.601
[bell on door jingles]

05:02.491 --> 05:05.296
Uh, is there
anything else today, sir?

05:05.648 --> 05:08.226
Yes.
How much for your headphones?

05:08.827 --> 05:11.273
No use hiding,
Black Panther.

05:11.382 --> 05:15.030
I can track you across galaxies,
if need be. [door opens]

05:17.874 --> 05:21.046
[laughs]
And the hunt resumes.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.920
[laughing]
A magnet?

05:26.151 --> 05:28.991
My ax is enchanted
Asgardian steel.

05:29.131 --> 05:31.717
It cannot be stifled
by your science.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.889
I was not aiming
for the ax.

05:44.534 --> 05:45.767
Ugh!

05:49.016 --> 05:51.859
Did you think that
you could get rid of me?

05:51.976 --> 05:53.750
Accept your defeat!

05:53.875 --> 05:56.289
It was useless
to retreat here.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.804
We have the Avengers.

05:59.624 --> 06:01.226
Not all of them.

06:06.674 --> 06:09.627
Who, or what, is this?

06:09.736 --> 06:12.182
His name is Vision.

06:16.841 --> 06:19.208
Assessing Skurge
in the Avengers Compound.

06:19.309 --> 06:21.654
May I be of some assistance,
Black Panther?

06:21.740 --> 06:23.451
Most certainly, my friend.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.161
Apologies for interrupting
your sleep mode.

06:27.426 --> 06:28.544
[grunts]

06:30.193 --> 06:31.591
No apology needed.

06:31.646 --> 06:34.388
My systems are updated
and ready for a challenge.

06:34.516 --> 06:37.482
[groans]
You woke up your pet.

06:37.935 --> 06:39.789
Then I'll wake mine!

06:44.289 --> 06:46.546
[growling]

06:46.665 --> 06:49.992
Vision, you said something
about wanting a challenge.

06:50.101 --> 06:51.634
[growling continues]

06:53.882 --> 06:55.585
[growling]
Look out!

06:56.035 --> 06:57.179
[grunting]

06:59.953 --> 07:01.328
[grunts]

07:01.960 --> 07:05.507
This magnificent creature
is an Asgardian dire wolf.

07:05.617 --> 07:08.257
It'll make quick work
of you, mortals.

07:08.370 --> 07:09.953
It is indeed fierce.

07:10.001 --> 07:12.429
However, so am I!

07:12.531 --> 07:14.304
[yells, grunts]

07:14.529 --> 07:15.796
[yells]
Huh?

07:16.062 --> 07:17.664
[yells]

07:18.515 --> 07:21.015
Huh?
You have intangibility?

07:21.159 --> 07:24.114
Aaahh!
[grunts]

07:24.304 --> 07:27.507
[growling] Vision, the
Avengers have been captured.

07:28.007 --> 07:30.593
[grunts]
Contact the others.

07:30.703 --> 07:32.625
Tell them it is time
to assemble.

07:32.764 --> 07:34.331
[roars]
[grunts]

07:34.429 --> 07:36.189
[whimpering]
[grunts]

07:36.798 --> 07:37.953
[grunts]

07:38.281 --> 07:39.617
Connected.

07:40.132 --> 07:42.749
Transmitting. Contact.

07:48.089 --> 07:50.178
<i>Captain Marvel,
you are needed.</i>

07:50.589 --> 07:53.780
My first day off in months,
and now I get the call.

07:53.889 --> 07:56.092
Oh, well.
What's a gal to do?

08:01.165 --> 08:03.623
[ringing, vibrating]

08:06.072 --> 08:07.593
You've gotta
be kidding me.

08:07.931 --> 08:09.695
Eighty-two new messages?

08:09.939 --> 08:11.970
<i>[Vision]
Ms. Marvel, you are needed.</i>

08:12.204 --> 08:15.462
This is the greatest moment
of my life.

08:15.822 --> 08:17.806
Okay, say something cool.

08:18.181 --> 08:19.837
Whoo-hoo!

08:27.720 --> 08:30.986
Careful, Ant-Man. T
he laser beams are live. Stay sharp.

08:31.095 --> 08:33.751
Oh, please. This is your
standard security vault.

08:33.845 --> 08:35.789
I'm the master of...
[phone ringing]

08:35.947 --> 08:37.557
Did we just trip the alarm?
[beeps]

08:37.592 --> 08:39.947
Or did you forget
to put your phone on "silent"?

08:40.048 --> 08:41.736
<i>Wasp, you are needed.</i>

08:41.884 --> 08:43.629
It's about dang time.

08:43.806 --> 08:46.632
- Who is it? What's going on?
- Forget this security test.

08:46.696 --> 08:48.415
- It's the Avengers!
- Hey, wait.

08:48.502 --> 08:50.673
They didn't call me.
[sighs]

08:50.868 --> 08:53.399
Maybe I missed it.
Do I have a signal right now?

08:53.517 --> 08:55.630
Oh, it must be that I don't have
a signal, and they couldn't...

08:55.677 --> 08:57.509
Scott.
Uh, yeah.

08:57.757 --> 08:58.790
[grunts]

09:01.220 --> 09:02.360
[grunts]

09:02.540 --> 09:05.798
[growls]
Getting tired, robot-man?

09:05.946 --> 09:08.548
I could do this all day.
[crash]

09:10.462 --> 09:13.426
Oh, good. Looks like I
didn't miss all the fun.

09:13.634 --> 09:16.946
Another combatant.
Welcome!

09:17.321 --> 09:19.540
Thanks.
Right back at ya.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.462
- [grunting]
- [grunts, yells]

09:23.470 --> 09:25.009
[grunts]
[grunts]

09:27.782 --> 09:29.251
[groaning]

09:29.306 --> 09:32.407
- [sniffing] [laughing]
- Oop, got your nose!

09:32.514 --> 09:34.118
[laughing]

09:34.294 --> 09:36.248
Oh, oh, oh! Got your tail!
[growls]

09:36.417 --> 09:38.313
[laughs, yells]

09:39.654 --> 09:42.336
Hey, how's it going? Whoa!

09:42.758 --> 09:44.586
[growling bark]

09:45.242 --> 09:47.493
Don't bark at me.
Bad dog.

09:47.541 --> 09:49.270
[roars]
[Ms. Marvel grunts]

09:49.398 --> 09:50.633
[whimpers]

09:51.421 --> 09:52.484
Sorry I'm late.

09:52.567 --> 09:55.157
I had to take two buses
and a subway transfer.

09:55.227 --> 09:57.375
We need to get you
a Sky-cycle, kid.

09:57.572 --> 10:00.321
Wait. Is she even old enough
for a driver's license?

10:00.475 --> 10:02.946
[Ant-Man] You can't expect me
to remember everyone's ages.

10:02.994 --> 10:04.726
It took me forever
just to learn your names.

10:04.774 --> 10:06.821
Thank you, everyone,
for your swift response.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.774
Thank <i> you!</i>
I can't believe <i> you</i> called <i> me.</i>

10:09.867 --> 10:12.008
Speaking of which,
what happened to my call?

10:12.102 --> 10:14.720
What, you lose my number
or something?

10:15.082 --> 10:17.992
So, Vision, you're the one who called.
What's this all about?

10:18.117 --> 10:19.917
I didn't call for you.
[footsteps approaching]

10:19.977 --> 10:21.258
He did.

10:21.429 --> 10:24.985
Whoa. Must be bad if you're
calling in reinforcements.

10:25.149 --> 10:29.117
Indeed. I would prefer
to handle things on my own.

10:29.289 --> 10:31.404
But this will
take all of us.

10:31.589 --> 10:35.719
The Avengers have been captured by
the Leader and a powerful new Cabal.

10:35.867 --> 10:38.227
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go bust 'em out.

10:38.336 --> 10:40.860
Wait a minute.
All of them got captured?

10:40.969 --> 10:42.328
Thor? The Hulk?

10:42.430 --> 10:45.551
If they got captured,
then what chance do we have?

10:48.282 --> 10:50.690
- Who's the new girl?
- [Black Panther] The Enchantress.

10:50.766 --> 10:54.560
She is a member of the Leader's Cabal.
And another Asgardian.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.680
[Enchantress]
Poor Skurge.

10:56.836 --> 10:59.532
Of course the Leader
would send muscle,

10:59.586 --> 11:02.117
when all that's needed
is a little finesse.

11:04.472 --> 11:06.282
Hold it right there.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.641
I didn't even notice
you there.

11:08.774 --> 11:11.774
You little humans
and your little games.

11:11.941 --> 11:13.297
But first...

11:14.703 --> 11:15.930
the Vibranium.

11:16.332 --> 11:17.680
Stop her!

11:24.969 --> 11:27.125
This has been
mildly amusing.

11:27.328 --> 11:29.495
The Leader
sends his regards.

11:29.543 --> 11:31.597
[laughing]

11:36.915 --> 11:38.172
The Leader.

11:38.344 --> 11:40.085
[Ant-Man]
Okay, then. Well, at least

11:40.133 --> 11:42.360
we don't have to go
that far to find them.

11:45.027 --> 11:46.760
If we survive.

11:54.657 --> 11:57.274
I hope you weren't
ur base.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.071
Or your friends.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.008
Oh, poor Avengers.

12:07.391 --> 12:09.797
We've eliminated
the problem below,

12:09.977 --> 12:13.430
and now with this,
we eliminate the Avengers.

12:13.508 --> 12:15.458
[evil laughter]

12:22.508 --> 12:24.749
We've only been Avengers
for, like, five minutes,

12:24.797 --> 12:27.110
and now the entire
compound's gone.

12:27.438 --> 12:29.282
We should get
our stories straight.

12:29.485 --> 12:31.750
One problem at a time,
Ms. Marvel.

12:31.852 --> 12:35.422
First, we must stop the Cabal
and rescue the Avengers.

12:35.742 --> 12:37.703
Then it's time to hit back.

12:37.836 --> 12:39.415
Let's get to work.

12:44.047 --> 12:46.032
[beeping]

12:46.141 --> 12:48.157
[whirring]

12:48.367 --> 12:50.326
[footsteps approaching]

12:50.500 --> 12:54.363
Took ages to load my
consciousness to this new body.

12:54.476 --> 12:57.273
If I ever get my hands
on that Panther again...

12:57.321 --> 12:59.938
[beeping]

13:00.196 --> 13:04.164
Something is on a direct course,
coming straight towards us.

13:06.914 --> 13:08.594
Fire all forward cannons.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.094
Everything!
Fire everything!

13:14.692 --> 13:18.782
A direct assault, with no
attempt to disguise themselves.

13:19.002 --> 13:20.423
What are they up to?

13:21.189 --> 13:23.494
[Wasp] Scott, this plan
of yours better be good.

13:23.580 --> 13:25.861
Wait for it.

13:26.676 --> 13:28.041
Okay, now.

13:37.470 --> 13:40.158
- All too easy.
- [laughing]

13:43.712 --> 13:44.978
Hmm.

13:47.166 --> 13:48.494
Not again.

13:48.606 --> 13:50.127
[all grunt, yell]

13:52.852 --> 13:54.314
[thudding]

13:55.009 --> 13:57.759
Everyone,
remember where we parked.

13:59.096 --> 14:00.384
[grunts]
[ax clangs]

14:00.432 --> 14:04.315
I do not get an ax?
Then you do not get an ax.

14:04.682 --> 14:07.494
If you can fly,
you can crash.

14:08.752 --> 14:09.752
[grunts]

14:09.994 --> 14:11.440
[grunts]

14:12.143 --> 14:14.119
I walk away from crashes.

14:14.195 --> 14:16.276
But you ain't
walking away from me.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.473
[grunting]

14:22.850 --> 14:25.684
[grunting]

14:27.199 --> 14:29.504
I let you off easy
last time, mortal.

14:29.629 --> 14:32.371
It won't happen again.
[yells]

14:39.541 --> 14:43.105
Your friends will fall.
Then you will be gone,

14:43.494 --> 14:47.697
and soon I will be left
to control everything.

14:47.770 --> 14:51.244
Oh, no, not everything!
[grunting]

14:51.481 --> 14:52.822
[groans]

14:55.583 --> 14:57.483
[grunting]

15:01.611 --> 15:04.643
Hey! Do not step
on my friends!

15:04.751 --> 15:07.214
Yeah, don't step on me!
[grunts]

15:07.284 --> 15:10.346
No way we're getting beat
by a walking television.

15:10.484 --> 15:12.550
Annoying pests.

15:12.624 --> 15:16.167
But big or small
matters little to fire.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.210
[grunts]

15:21.245 --> 15:23.620
[yells, grunts]

15:23.721 --> 15:24.893
[grunts]

15:25.045 --> 15:26.362
We are losing.

15:26.433 --> 15:29.104
They have momentum,
but we can turn it around.

15:29.253 --> 15:32.620
We just need a game changer.
Some way to mix things up.

15:32.693 --> 15:34.323
Mix things up?

15:35.027 --> 15:36.860
Switch!
[yells]

15:37.705 --> 15:39.678
[grunts]

15:40.043 --> 15:41.268
[grunts]

15:41.911 --> 15:44.252
Enchantress,
I hear you're Asgardian.

15:44.362 --> 15:47.557
Great.
Then I don't have to hold back.

15:48.305 --> 15:50.084
Who dares?

15:50.151 --> 15:51.784
My friends call me Carol,

15:51.950 --> 15:55.017
but you can call me Captain Marvel!
[grunts]

15:55.268 --> 15:57.549
Avengers,
keep them off balance.

15:57.612 --> 15:59.112
Change opponents.

15:59.612 --> 16:01.198
[grunting]

16:03.596 --> 16:06.463
I think I am starting to enjoy
being part of a team.

16:07.552 --> 16:11.520
Nowhere left to run,
insects.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.479
"Vas" is the meaning of this?

16:13.621 --> 16:15.526
Hey, guys.
Wanna trade?

16:15.909 --> 16:19.026
Looks like a fair trade to me.
[grunting]

16:19.862 --> 16:21.776
[yells, grunts]

16:22.193 --> 16:24.126
[straining]

16:24.456 --> 16:25.901
[grunts]

16:30.968 --> 16:32.385
Thanks, Viz.

16:32.521 --> 16:35.825
Improbability, variance, and
odds are turning in our favor.

16:35.981 --> 16:37.920
[huffing]

16:41.108 --> 16:42.137
Ugh!

16:42.254 --> 16:46.020
Infuriating,
but ultimately inconsequential.

16:46.145 --> 16:48.246
Nothing will save you now.

16:48.999 --> 16:50.279
[grunts]

16:51.963 --> 16:55.145
Forget the Cabal!
Get the Leader!

16:55.973 --> 16:57.306
Aahh!

16:58.129 --> 16:59.426
[grunts]

17:04.294 --> 17:06.945
[grunts]
Cabal, to me!

17:07.079 --> 17:09.188
We can still destroy them!

17:12.056 --> 17:14.021
[exhales]
No, Leader.

17:14.156 --> 17:16.759
I'm afraid
that time has passed.

17:17.023 --> 17:18.060
Huh?

17:18.762 --> 17:19.848
Did you really think

17:19.963 --> 17:22.321
<i>you</i> were our true leader?

17:22.369 --> 17:23.401
Huh?

17:23.744 --> 17:26.167
You're just like the Avengers.

17:26.291 --> 17:29.503
Pawns in a chess game
larger than yourselves.

17:29.614 --> 17:33.104
And by the time you realize
what you're up against...

17:33.231 --> 17:35.628
Checkmate.
[beeps]

17:37.822 --> 17:39.815
[beeping]

17:40.291 --> 17:42.565
[Ms. Marvel]
That looks baddish.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.712
[yells]

17:44.840 --> 17:49.432
Avengers no more!
[laughing]

17:49.708 --> 17:51.690
The cannon's
been restarted!

17:51.775 --> 17:54.743
[beeping continues]
[grunting]

17:56.262 --> 17:58.755
Can't get through
the force field.

18:03.010 --> 18:06.949
You can hack the controls, right?
Trying, but access is encrypted.

18:09.113 --> 18:11.046
[grunting]

18:11.240 --> 18:14.355
Army, we can't stop it!
What do we do?

18:14.558 --> 18:17.363
[grunts]
Do what you do best.

18:17.511 --> 18:20.464
Carry on. Avenge!

18:32.192 --> 18:33.988
[whirring]

18:46.440 --> 18:48.089
We lost them.

18:54.439 --> 18:58.053
Sensors indicate that all onboard
systems have lost power.

19:01.701 --> 19:06.068
This carrier will either crash into the
city beneath us, or it will explode.

19:06.225 --> 19:09.071
Either way,
the city is now in immediate danger.

19:09.209 --> 19:11.451
Go! I can fly
any ship in the galaxy.

19:11.521 --> 19:14.412
Should be no problem
crashing this somewhere safe.

19:14.467 --> 19:17.154
[Black Panther]
Everyone, evacuate to my jet.

19:18.154 --> 19:19.678
Good luck, Captain.

19:19.957 --> 19:21.324
[grunts]

19:27.826 --> 19:31.052
[alarm buzzing]
[grunting]

19:31.840 --> 19:35.286
[grunting]
Come on, baby.

19:35.396 --> 19:38.349
Hold together
just a little longer.

19:40.393 --> 19:43.044
[alarm continues buzzing]
[straining]

19:55.052 --> 19:56.284
[grunts]

20:04.027 --> 20:07.403
The Avengers are gone.
That we know.

20:07.661 --> 20:10.177
What we don't know
is if they're alive or not.

20:10.786 --> 20:12.013
The numbers say they're not,

20:12.061 --> 20:15.192
but... my gut tells me they are.

20:15.435 --> 20:19.908
But, Dr. Foster,
if they are alive, where are they?

20:20.036 --> 20:21.552
Leader's not talking.

20:21.639 --> 20:25.013
The way the Cabal tricked him,
he probably doesn't even know.

20:25.192 --> 20:28.513
I've started to rebuild the technology
I used to look for Tony Stark.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.982
Once it's running,
if they're out there,

20:31.209 --> 20:32.716
I'll find them.

20:37.630 --> 20:39.630
So, now what?

20:39.950 --> 20:44.199
"Do what you do best.
Carry on. Avenge."

20:44.544 --> 20:47.310
Those were Captain America's
last words to me.

20:47.450 --> 20:50.216
We defeated the Leader,
but we still have work to do.

20:50.310 --> 20:54.200
Until Dr. Foster finds them,
<i>we</i> are the Avengers.

20:54.349 --> 20:55.692
We're not the regular team.

20:55.826 --> 20:59.217
We're like All-New,
All-Different, or...

20:59.295 --> 21:00.970
Or nothing. That's it.

21:01.143 --> 21:03.811
All-New, All-Different Avengers.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.608
One person
can make a difference.

21:06.794 --> 21:10.217
One team can make
a world of difference.

21:10.350 --> 21:13.225
And I am honored
to call you my teammates.

21:16.131 --> 21:18.178
Avengers Assemble!
