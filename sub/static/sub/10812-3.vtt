WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.436
- WELL, NOT TO BE
TOO FORWARD,

00:02.469 --> 00:04.905
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO BE INCLUDED
IN YOUR WILL.

00:06.974 --> 00:08.074
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:08.108 --> 00:10.644
- MY NAME
IS NATHAN FIELDER,

00:10.677 --> 00:13.380
AND I GRADUATED FROM ONE
OF CANADA'S TOP BUSINESS SCHOOLS

00:13.413 --> 00:15.282
WITH REALLY GOOD GRADES.

00:15.315 --> 00:16.950
NOW I'M USING MY KNOWLEDGE

00:16.984 --> 00:19.887
TO HELP STRUGGLING
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS MAKE IT

00:19.920 --> 00:20.954
IN THIS COMPETITIVE WORLD.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

00:29.530 --> 00:31.431
THIS...

00:31.465 --> 00:33.300
IS NATHAN FOR YOU.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.103
FASHION IS A
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY,

00:36.136 --> 00:38.805
BUT SADLY, OUR OBSESSION
WITH CLOTHING OFTEN MEANS

00:38.839 --> 00:40.807
THAT PEOPLE WILL GO
AS FAR AS STEALING

00:40.841 --> 00:43.477
JUST TO GET THEIR HANDS
ON THAT HOT NEW STYLE.

00:43.510 --> 00:45.979
AND NO ONE KNOWS THIS BETTER
THAN GABRIELLE ROMERO,

00:46.013 --> 00:47.748
MANAGER OF HARDWEAR CLOTHING

00:47.781 --> 00:49.116
IN LARCHMONT VILLAGE,
CALIFORNIA.

00:49.149 --> 00:51.618
- OFTENTIMES WHEN SHOPLIFTING,
THEY COME IN TEAMS,

00:51.652 --> 00:53.453
USUALLY MORE THAN ONE PERSON,

00:53.487 --> 00:55.088
USUALLY ABOUT THREE PEOPLE.

00:55.122 --> 00:58.025
- IT'S THE REAL DARK SIDE
OF RUNNING A CLOTHING STORE,

00:58.058 --> 00:59.626
BUT OFTEN IN BUSINESS,
A NEGATIVE LIKE THIS

00:59.660 --> 01:01.695
CAN ACTUALLY BE TURNED
INTO A POSITIVE.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.697
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.199
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TRICKS
PEOPLE DO

01:05.232 --> 01:07.201
TO STEAL STUFF?

01:07.234 --> 01:09.636
- UM, DEFINITELY, THEY C--
THEY TRAVEL IN PACKS.

01:09.670 --> 01:10.804
- SORRY, YOU WERE LOOKING
AT MY HAT.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.273
- OH, IT'S OKAY.
- OH, OKAY. IS IT--

01:13.307 --> 01:14.474
IS IT OK--
IS IT WEIRD, OR--

01:14.508 --> 01:15.542
- NO. YOUR HAT?
- I DON'T NORMALLY WEAR...

01:15.576 --> 01:16.543
- NO, IT LOOKS GOOD.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.711
- THIS TYPE OF HAT.
- I LIKE IT.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.846
- OH, IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T HAVE TO WEAR IT.

01:18.879 --> 01:19.847
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.448
- BETTER?
- SORRY, YEAH.

01:21.481 --> 01:22.716
SO WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
ABOUT SHOPLIFTING?

01:22.749 --> 01:24.952
- I DON'T REMEMBER.
IT HAPPENS.

01:24.985 --> 01:27.588
- BUT MAYBE SHOPLIFTING
ISN'T SUCH A BAD THING.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.456
YOU SEE, IN FASHION,
GOOD-LOOKING PEOPLE

01:29.489 --> 01:30.657
ARE TRENDSETTERS.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.093
SO RATHER THAN TRYING TO STOP
ALL SHOPLIFTERS,

01:33.093 --> 01:35.696
HARDWEAR CAN BENEFIT
BY LETTING ATTRACTIVE THIEVES

01:35.729 --> 01:36.763
GO FREE,

01:36.797 --> 01:38.498
BECAUSE IF ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE
WEAR IT,

01:38.532 --> 01:41.535
THEIR LESS ATTRACTIVE FRIENDS
WILL COME AND BUY IT.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.573
- OH.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.809
OKAY.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.177
- WHAT--WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:50.210 --> 01:51.378
- SO WE JUST WAIT
FOR AN ATTRACTIVE PERSON

01:51.411 --> 01:52.546
TO COME IN?

01:52.579 --> 01:53.881
DO I HAVE TO THINK
THEY'RE ATTRACTIVE?

01:53.914 --> 01:55.115
WHO'S THE JUDGE?

01:55.115 --> 01:57.217
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE
HAVE TO DECIDE.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.419
- OKAY. OKAY.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.755
- I NEEDED TO PROVE TO GABRIELLE
THAT THIS WOULD WORK,

02:01.788 --> 02:04.057
SO FIRST, I HAD HER
AND HER STAFF

02:04.091 --> 02:05.492
EACH COME UP WITH A LIST
OF TRAITS

02:05.526 --> 02:07.928
THAT THEY FIND ATTRACTIVE.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.395
THEN LATER,
I COMPILED ALL THE TRAITS

02:09.429 --> 02:11.365
INTO A MASTER LIST.

02:11.398 --> 02:13.367
NOW I NEEDED SOMEONE
TO ENFORCE IT,

02:13.400 --> 02:14.635
SO I HIRED
A SECURITY GUARD.

02:14.668 --> 02:15.769
SIMON?
- HI, GOOD TO MEET YOU.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.337
- THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT.
- OKAY.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.705
- SO WE'RE DOING
THIS THING HERE

02:18.739 --> 02:21.175
WHERE WE'RE ALLOWING PEOPLE
TO SHOPLIFT ONE ITEM,

02:21.208 --> 02:22.576
BUT ONLY
IF THEY'RE ATTRACTIVE.

02:22.609 --> 02:23.744
- OKAY.
- SO THE STAFF AND I

02:23.777 --> 02:26.113
CAME UP WITH A LIST
OF, UH, SOME TRAITS

02:26.146 --> 02:27.748
THAT QUALIFY A PERSON
AS ATTRACTIVE.

02:27.781 --> 02:28.749
- RIGHT.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.083
- SO, BASICALLY,
IF SOMEONE MEETS

02:30.083 --> 02:31.718
ALL THESE TRAITS,

02:31.752 --> 02:33.554
YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO SHOPLIFT.

02:33.587 --> 02:34.621
OTHERWISE,
YOU HAVE TO STOP THEM.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.889
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.091
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY,
THINGS LIKE "BIG PENIS"

02:38.091 --> 02:39.393
JUST APPLY TO MEN.

02:39.426 --> 02:40.460
- RIGHT.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.695
- WITH EVERYTHING IN PLACE,

02:41.728 --> 02:43.130
WE WERE READY TO OPEN OUR DOORS
TO CUSTOMERS.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.403
THE NORMAL TRAFFIC
WAS COMING IN,

02:49.436 --> 02:52.139
BUT I REALIZED THAT PEOPLE
WERE MISSING THE SIGN OUT FRONT.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.641
SO JUST TO BE SAFE,
I WENT UP TO EACH PERSON

02:54.675 --> 02:56.109
AND TOLD THEM
ABOUT THE PROMOTION.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.878
WE'RE DOING
A SPECIAL PROMOTION TODAY

02:57.911 --> 03:00.781
WHERE ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE ARE
ALLOWED TO STEAL ONE ITEM.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.783
TO SHOPLIFT ONE ITEM.

03:02.816 --> 03:03.917
- YOU WORK HERE?

03:03.951 --> 03:05.452
- I'M REPRESENTING
THE BUSINESS.

03:05.485 --> 03:07.120
- WHY WOULD YOU TELL ME
TO STEAL SOMETHING?

03:07.154 --> 03:09.122
- IT'S A SPECIAL PROMOTION.
- OKAY.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.858
- IT WAS WORKING GREAT,
AS SEVERAL WOMEN

03:10.891 --> 03:12.526
WERE SHOPLIFTING ITEMS.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.133
- BUT ACCORDING TO SIMON,

03:20.167 --> 03:22.135
THE FIRST FEW WOMEN
JUST DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.737
- SHE DIDN'T PAY
FOR THE ITEM.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.974
- IT WAS STRANGE BECAUSE THESE
WOMEN WERE ATTRACTIVE,

03:27.074 --> 03:29.409
BUT THEN I BEGAN TO SUSPECT
THAT OUR SECURITY GUARD

03:29.443 --> 03:30.911
ONLY CARED
ABOUT ONE THING.

03:30.944 --> 03:35.082
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.
- THANK YOU, YOU TOO.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.517
- WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF HER?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.986
- SHE WAS, UH,
SHE WAS RATHER PRETTY.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.454
- WHAT DID YOU LIKE
ABOUT HER THE MOST?

03:40.487 --> 03:41.722
- UH, HER FIGURE.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.091
SHE HAD, YOU KNOW,
A PRETTY--PRETTY GOOD BUILD.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.092
- OH. DO YOU LIKE THAT?

03:45.125 --> 03:46.860
- YES.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.462
- WAIT, WHAT DO YOU LIKE?

03:48.495 --> 03:50.998
- UM, YOU KNOW,
THE WAY HER--

03:51.098 --> 03:52.499
THE WAY HER B--
HER CHEST WAS.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.468
- IS THAT WHAT YOU
WERE LOOKING AT THE MOST?

03:54.501 --> 03:56.537
- UM, YEAH.
AND ALSO SHE WAS--

03:56.570 --> 03:58.105
HER F--HER FACE
WAS SORT OF PRETTY,

03:58.138 --> 04:01.475
BUT, YOU KNOW, NOT--
NOT, LIKE, TOTALLY PRETTY.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.477
- THE PART YOU LIKED WAS--
- YEAH.

04:03.510 --> 04:04.478
IT WAS--
- YEAH.

04:04.511 --> 04:05.546
- YEAH.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.114
- BIG BOOBS
WASN'T ON THE LIST.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.749
AND CLEARLY, SIMON HAD
AN OBSESSION.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.351
AND AFTER STOPPING
SEVERAL MORE ATTRACTIVE WOMEN

04:11.385 --> 04:12.653
WITH MODEST CHESTS...

04:12.686 --> 04:14.888
- YOU HAVE TO--YOU HAVE TO PAY
FOR ALL YOUR ITEMS.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.790
- OKAY.
- I HAD TO INTERVENE.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.825
LET'S SAY THERE'S NO LIST.
YOU JUST SEE HER ON THE STREET.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.060
WHAT DO YOU--
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER?

04:21.060 --> 04:22.729
- SHE IS SOMEWHAT PRETTY,

04:22.763 --> 04:25.065
BUT SHE COULD BE PRETTIER.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.366
- AND WHAT WOULD MAKE HER
PRETTIER?

04:26.400 --> 04:28.702
- UH, TO LET HER HAIR DOWN
AND, YOU KNOW...

04:28.735 --> 04:30.237
MAYBE SMI--
- AND WHAT WAS THAT?

04:30.270 --> 04:33.073
YOU DID THAT AFTER.
TO LET HER HAIR DOWN AND WHAT?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.141
"AND, YOU KNOW--"

04:34.174 --> 04:35.976
I HAD TO TAKE SIMON ASIDE.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.711
SO YOU'RE SAYING
DOUBLE "D" BREASTS

04:37.744 --> 04:39.112
ARE ESSENTIAL FOR YOU?

04:39.146 --> 04:41.582
- IT'S GOTTA BE--
IT'S GOTTA BE SUBSTANTIAL.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.219
- ALL RIGHT.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.087
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
STICK TO THE LIST THEN, FOR NOW.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.522
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL STICK TO THE LIST.

04:48.555 --> 04:49.756
- THANKS.
- YEAH.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.358
- WITH SIMON BACK ON TRACK,

04:51.391 --> 04:53.694
WE HAD A LOT
OF WOMEN SHOPLIFTING.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.162
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING

04:55.195 --> 04:56.930
UNLESS THEIR FRIENDS
ARE ACTUALLY COMING IN

04:56.964 --> 04:58.098
TO BUY THE STUFF.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.433
SO, TO BE SURE
THIS WAS HAPPENING,

04:59.466 --> 05:01.435
A WEEK LATER,
I USED THE PHONE NUMBER

05:01.468 --> 05:02.703
ON THE APPEARANCE RELEASE

05:02.736 --> 05:04.671
TO CONTACT ONE OF THE MOST
ATTRACTIVE SHOPLIFTERS

05:04.705 --> 05:06.240
OF THE DAY

05:06.273 --> 05:09.276
TO GET PROOF
THAT THE CONCEPT WORKED.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.644
HI, NATALIE. UH,

05:10.677 --> 05:15.048
YOU SHOPLIFTED AN ITEM
FROM HARDWEAR, UH, LAST WEEK.

05:15.082 --> 05:19.419
IS THAT CORRECT?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.655
YES, YES, YOU'RE ALLOWED.
YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE.

05:21.688 --> 05:22.689
AFTER SOME CONVINCING,

05:22.723 --> 05:24.258
SHE AGREED
TO MEET WITH ME.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.159
I KNEW THAT IF IT DIDN'T WORK
WITH HER,

05:26.193 --> 05:27.561
IT WOULDN'T WORK
WITH ANYONE.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.530
WHO ARE--
WHO ARE THOSE GUYS?

05:29.563 --> 05:32.099
- OH, MY FRIENDS--MY FIANCE
AND THE GUY I'M STAYING WITH.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.936
- OH, OKAY.
THANKS FOR COMING OUT.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.805
SO WHAT WAS IT
THAT YOU SHOPLIFTED?

05:38.839 --> 05:40.107
- A LITTLE BLACK DRESS,

05:40.140 --> 05:41.575
SHORT IN THE FRONT,
LONG IN THE BACK,

05:41.608 --> 05:43.477
WITH A WHITE SKULL ON IT.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.678
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.079
- AND HAS ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS
SEEN YOU IN IT?

05:46.079 --> 05:47.181
- YEAH, THESE GUYS HAVE,
BUT NONE OF MY--

05:47.214 --> 05:49.183
- ANY GIRLS?
- NO.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.151
- NO GIRLS.
- NO, NO GIRLS.

05:51.185 --> 05:54.588
ALL RIGHT, WELL,

05:54.621 --> 05:56.590
YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE A FRIEND
TO BUY SOMETHING FROM THERE.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.091
- OH, THAT--I--

05:58.091 --> 05:59.126
NOBODY SAID THAT TO ME.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.028
- WELL, YOU KIND OF HAVE TO.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.697
YOU KNOW, I--

06:03.730 --> 06:06.600
I'D HATE TO SHOW THE POLICE
THAT FOOTAGE

06:06.633 --> 06:09.503
OF YOU STEALING.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.572
- OKAY, WELL, I CAN TRY,

06:11.605 --> 06:13.507
AND IF SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO BUY ANYTHING,

06:13.540 --> 06:15.142
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE DRESS BACK.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.178
HEY, JULIE, HOW ARE YOU?

06:20.180 --> 06:21.815
- I'M A NICE GUY.
- I'VE GOTTA SHOW YOU

06:21.849 --> 06:23.217
THIS REALLY CUTE
LITTLE OUTFIT.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.786
- NATALIE'S FRIEND AGREED
TO MEET HER AT HARDWEAR.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.120
BUT JUST TO GUARANTEE
IT WOULD WORK,

06:27.154 --> 06:29.423
BEFORE SHE ARRIVED,
I GAVE HER A HIDDEN EARPIECE

06:29.456 --> 06:30.490
SO I COULD TELL HER
WHAT TO SAY.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.792
HOT DOG.

06:31.825 --> 06:32.960
- GOT IT.
- WHAT'D I SAY?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.761
- HOT DOG.
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.064
- HI.
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

06:37.064 --> 06:38.465
- MWAH. GOOD, THANKS.

06:38.498 --> 06:39.533
DO YOU LIKE IT?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.134
- YEAH, I LOVE IT.
- NICE.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.070
- HI, LADIES.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.104
- HELLO.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.073
- ASK HER IF SHE LIKES
WEARING SKULLS.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.075
- DO YOU LIKE SKULLS?

06:48.108 --> 06:49.309
- YEAH, I LOVE SKULLS.
- YOU DO?

06:49.343 --> 06:50.310
- YEAH.

06:50.344 --> 06:51.778
- EVERYONE'S WEARING SKULLS.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.280
- EVERYONE'S
WEARING SKULLS.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.083
WE MUST FIND SOMETHING
WITH SKULLS ON IT FOR YOU.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.719
- THESE WERE ALL DESIGNED
BY GERALDO RIVERA.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.755
- THESE WERE ALL DESIGNED
BY GERALDO RIVERA.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.790
- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.026
OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.294
- MAKE HER BUY THE SHIRT.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.929
- I THINK YOU
SHOULD BUY IT NOW.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.464
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.235
- $79.33.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.137
- AND WITH THOSE
FEW LITTLE WORDS...

07:17.171 --> 07:18.739
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.808
- THE STRENGTH OF MY CONCEPT
WAS UNDENIABLE.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.243
- SEE YOU LATER.
THANK YOU.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.279
- AND LATER THAT DAY,
I PAID GABRIELLE A VISIT

07:25.312 --> 07:27.915
TO ACCEPT
MY WELL-DESERVED PRAISE.

07:27.948 --> 07:28.949
HOW'S BUSINESS?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.651
- UH, BUSINESS IS GOOD.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.319
- GOOD.
- YEAH.

07:32.352 --> 07:34.588
- SO, JUST WONDERING,
HAS ANYONE, UH,

07:34.621 --> 07:37.391
COME IN BECAUSE OF AN ITEM

07:37.424 --> 07:38.659
THEIR FRIEND SHOPLIFTED
OR ANYTHING?

07:38.692 --> 07:41.662
- YEAH, ACTUALLY, ONE--
ONE GIRL DID COME BACK.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.463
- REALLY?
- YEAH, SHE BROUGHT A FRIEND.

07:43.497 --> 07:44.498
- OH, MY GOD.
- YEAH, YEAH.

07:44.531 --> 07:45.499
- HUH.

07:45.532 --> 07:46.800
- HER FRIEND BOUGHT A TOP.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.702
- SO IT WORKED.
- I MEAN,

07:48.735 --> 07:50.404
IT'S JUST ONE.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.705
- HUH.

07:51.738 --> 07:52.940
- BUT IT'S NOT GUARANTEED
TO CONTINUALLY WORK.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.074
- HUH.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.642
BUT IT DID WORK.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.177
- YEAH, IT WORKED WITH THE ONE,
LIKE I SAID.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.712
- HUH.
- BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE

07:58.745 --> 08:00.047
KIND OF A RISK,
MORE THAN--

08:00.080 --> 08:01.715
- HMM.
- MM-HMM.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.417
- HUH.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.352
ALL RIGHT, UM--
- IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.920
- WELL, GOOD LUCK...
- THANK YOU.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.021
WITH YOUR BUSINESS, GABRIELLE.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.423
- THANK YOU.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.024
- I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK.
- THANK YOU.

08:11.058 --> 08:14.061
- OKAY.
- SEE YOU LATER.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.701
- WHOOP.

08:20.734 --> 08:21.835
FROM DOING THIS SHOW,

08:21.868 --> 08:23.170
ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS
I GET IS,

08:23.203 --> 08:25.339
"HOW DO YOU COME UP
WITH YOUR IDEAS?"

08:25.372 --> 08:28.108
THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE--
RESEARCH.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.277
WHEN I WANT TO GET A SNEAK PEEK
AT A BUSINESS,

08:30.310 --> 08:32.611
I'LL OFTEN GO AHEAD OF TIME
IN DISGUISE.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.114
THIS ALLOWS ME
TO TAKE A QUICK LOOK

08:34.147 --> 08:35.248
AT HOW THE PLACE IS RUN

08:35.282 --> 08:37.351
AND HELPS ME COME UP
WITH IDEAS.

08:37.384 --> 08:38.919
BUT IF I WANT TO OBSERVE
A BUSINESS

08:38.952 --> 08:41.154
FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME
WITHOUT AROUSING SUSPICION,

08:41.188 --> 08:44.124
I'LL USE
THE LIBRARIAN'S QUEST.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.259
DESIGNED TO LOOK LIKE
A BORING '80s ARCADE GAME,

08:46.293 --> 08:48.562
THE BODY HAS BEEN
COMPLETELY GUTTED OUT

08:48.595 --> 08:51.531
AND REBUILT TO FIT A MAN
OF MY PROPORTIONS.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.333
TO GET INSIDE THE BUSINESS,

08:53.367 --> 08:54.801
I HAVE MY CREW SAY
THEY'RE A MOVING COMPANY

08:54.835 --> 08:55.802
WHOSE TRUCK BROKE DOWN.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.037
- HEY, DO YOU MIND

08:57.070 --> 08:58.238
IF WE JUST KEEP THIS HERE
FOR A FEW MINUTES?

08:58.271 --> 08:59.439
OUR TRUCK BROKE DOWN.

08:59.473 --> 09:01.241
- MORE OFTEN THAN NOT,
STORE EMPLOYEES

09:01.274 --> 09:03.510
WILL AGREE TO LET THEM LEAVE
THE GAME,

09:03.543 --> 09:04.745
ALLOWING ME
TO SECRETLY OBSERVE

09:04.778 --> 09:06.480
HOW THE BUSINESS IS RUN
WHEN THEY THINK

09:06.513 --> 09:08.148
NO ONE IS WATCHING.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.250
BECAUSE I'M OFTEN IN THERE
FOR LONG STRETCHES,

09:10.283 --> 09:13.120
THE GAME'S POWER CORD
IS CONVENIENTLY A STRAW,

09:13.153 --> 09:16.123
WHICH ENABLES MY CREW
TO DISCREETLY DROP OFF DRINKS

09:16.156 --> 09:17.824
TO KEEP ME HYDRATED.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.661
AND WITH AN EXORBITANT PRICE
AND BORING MOVES,

09:20.694 --> 09:23.797
I CAN ALSO FEEL SAFE
THAT NO ONE WILL TRY TO PLAY IT.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.365
THEN, WHEN I'VE SEEN ENOUGH,

09:25.399 --> 09:27.534
MY CREW COMES BACK
AND RETRIEVES ME.

09:27.534 --> 09:28.902
- THANKS AGAIN.
- OH, NO PROBLEM.

09:28.935 --> 09:29.970
- BYE.
- THANKS.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.005
- IT MAY SEEM LIKE
A LONG WAY TO GO

09:32.039 --> 09:33.340
JUST FOR RESEARCH,

09:33.373 --> 09:34.675
BUT IT WAS THIS EXACT METHOD
THAT HELPED ME

09:34.708 --> 09:37.744
COME UP WITH MY IDEA
FOR BILLY'S DELI.

09:37.778 --> 09:41.048
SMACK-DAB IN THE MIDDLE
OF GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA,

09:41.081 --> 09:42.549
RESTAURATEUR GLORIA PIKE
IS SICK AND TIRED

09:42.549 --> 09:44.785
OF HER DINER BEING EMPTY.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.354
- THE ECONOMY OR SOMETHING
AFFECTING A LITTLE BIT.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.956
BUT LITTLE BIT,
KIND OF SLOW.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.159
- PRIOR TO MY VISIT,
I USED THE ARCADE GAME

09:52.192 --> 09:54.561
TO OBSERVE BILLY'S DELI.

09:54.561 --> 09:57.064
SURPRISINGLY, I SAW NOTHING
WRONG WITH THE BUSINESS

09:57.097 --> 09:58.999
OR THE FOOD.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.403
BUT AFTER BEING IN THERE
FOR SO LONG,

10:03.437 --> 10:05.205
I REALLY HAD TO GO PEE,

10:05.238 --> 10:07.341
AND IT WAS ONLY ONCE I TRIED
TO USE THE BATHROOM

10:07.374 --> 10:09.042
AT SOME OF THE NEIGHBORING
BUSINESSES...

10:09.076 --> 10:12.412
HEY, DO YOU GUYS HAVE
A BATHROOM I COULD USE?

10:12.446 --> 10:15.649
THAT I REALIZED THERE WAS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR BILLY'S.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.751
SO WHILE I WAS HIDING
IN THE ARCADE GAME,

10:17.784 --> 10:19.586
I NOTICED THAT YOU GUYS
HAVE A STRICT

10:19.619 --> 10:22.222
"BATHROOMS FOR CUSTOMERS ONLY"
POLICY.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.557
- MM-HMM.
- AND FOR THAT,

10:23.590 --> 10:25.258
I CONGRATULATE YOU.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.261
- THANK YOU.
- CONGRATULATIONS...

10:28.295 --> 10:29.696
ON LOSING MONEY.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.365
- LOSING MONEY?

10:31.398 --> 10:34.768
- THE PLAN: AN "ANYONE CAN USE
OUR BATHROOM" POLICY.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.037
IN AN AREA
WHERE BATHROOMS ARE SCARCE,

10:37.070 --> 10:38.839
BILLY'S HAS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO ATTRACT

10:38.872 --> 10:41.274
A SLEW OF BATHROOM-GOERS
THAT CAN THEN BE CONVERTED

10:41.308 --> 10:42.776
TO CUSTOMERS.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.044
ONCE THEY USE THE BATHROOM,

10:44.077 --> 10:46.279
THEN WE SELL THEM
ON EATING HERE.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.280
- MM-HMM.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.548
- YOU GUYS COULD BECOME

10:48.548 --> 10:52.152
THE NEIGHBORHOOD TOILET.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.887
- YEAH, I GUESS
IT'S GOOD IDEA.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.589
- AND WHERE BETTER TO MARKET
TO THEM

10:55.622 --> 10:58.725
THAN WHERE WE HAVE THEIR
COMPLETE, UNDIVIDED ATTENTION?

10:58.759 --> 11:00.260
WE PUT TOGETHER
A SHORT COMMERCIAL

11:00.293 --> 11:01.561
FEATURING GLORIA,

11:01.595 --> 11:02.696
AND ONCE IT WAS DONE,

11:02.729 --> 11:04.564
I INSTALLED
MOTION-ACTIVATED MONITORS

11:04.564 --> 11:07.367
IN EVERY BATHROOM STALL
AND URINAL AT BILLY'S.

11:07.401 --> 11:08.568
WITH THE AD IN PLACE,

11:08.568 --> 11:10.270
IT WAS TIME
TO START SPREADING THE WORD

11:10.304 --> 11:12.272
THAT BILLY'S BATHROOMS
WERE FOR EVERYONE.

11:12.306 --> 11:15.175
THE WINDOW SIGNS WOULD WORK
GREAT FOR PASSERS-BY,

11:15.208 --> 11:16.276
BUT I ALSO WANTED
TO SPREAD AWARENESS

11:16.310 --> 11:18.245
TO OTHER BUSINESSES
IN THE AREA.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.148
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY CUSTOMERS
THAT NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM,

11:21.181 --> 11:23.383
YOU CAN SEND THEM
TO BILLY'S DOWN THE BLOCK.

11:23.417 --> 11:24.518
- OH, OKAY.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.786
- NOW I WAS READY
TO CONVINCE PEOPLE

11:25.819 --> 11:27.587
WHO CAME FOR THE BATHROOM

11:27.621 --> 11:28.588
TO STAY FOR THE FOOD.

11:28.622 --> 11:29.589
HI, THERE.

11:29.623 --> 11:31.925
ARE YOU HERE
TO USE THE BATHROOM?

11:31.958 --> 11:33.226
OH, TO EAT? OKAY.
- YEAH.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.729
- ARE YOU HERE
TO USE THE BATHROOM?

11:35.762 --> 11:37.764
HERE TO EAT.

11:37.798 --> 11:38.765
THREE?
- YES.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.201
- FOR THE BATHROOM
OR FOR A TABLE?

11:41.234 --> 11:43.403
OKAY, UM, YEAH,
SHE CAN HELP YOU.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.939
AT FIRST, IT WAS LOOKING
LIKE MY SIGNS WEREN'T WORKING,

11:45.973 --> 11:48.575
BUT THEN THE BATHROOM CROWD
STARTED TO ARRIVE.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.210
HI.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.745
FOR THE RESTROOM?
- YEAH.

11:51.778 --> 11:52.913
YES, IT'S RIGHT AT THE BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.214
- OKAY.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.382
- THEY WERE ABOUT TO SEE
OUR COMMERCIAL,

11:55.415 --> 11:56.817
AND I WANTED TO SHOW GLORIA
THEIR REACTIONS.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.019
SO IT'S NOT ENTIRELY LEGAL,

11:59.052 --> 12:00.554
BUT WE SET UP
A COUPLE HIDDEN CAMERAS

12:00.554 --> 12:01.922
INSIDE THE BATHROOM.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.991
I'LL JUST NEED TO GET PEOPLE
TO SIGN A RELEASE

12:04.024 --> 12:05.158
CONSENTING TO THE USE
OF THE FOOTAGE

12:05.192 --> 12:06.259
ONCE THEY GET OUT,

12:06.293 --> 12:08.562
WHICH I DON'T FORESEE
BEING AN ISSUE.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.030
- HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?

12:10.063 --> 12:11.765
WELCOME TO BILLY'S.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.967
PLEASE ENJOY THIS MESSAGE.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.036
- YOU MAY NOT BE A CUSTOMER,

12:16.069 --> 12:18.372
BUT AT BILLY'S,
YOU'RE STILL WELCOME

12:18.405 --> 12:19.973
TO USE THE BATHROOM.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.175
AND WHILE YOU'RE DOING
YOUR THING,

12:22.209 --> 12:25.512
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU A BIT
ABOUT OUR THING--

12:25.545 --> 12:27.547
MAKING DELICIOUS FOOD.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.915
JUST LOOK
AT THESE FINE DISHES.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.752
YOU CAN ALMOST SMELL
THE QUALITY FOOD,

12:31.785 --> 12:34.521
MADE FROM THE FINEST
INGREDIENTS AVAILABLE,

12:34.554 --> 12:36.556
LIKE OUR FAMOUS
PASTRAMI SANDWICH,

12:36.590 --> 12:38.158
FRESH COBB SALAD,

12:38.191 --> 12:41.662
OR OUR RICH HOMEMADE CHILI.

12:41.695 --> 12:44.931
MM-MM, LOOK AT THAT CHILI.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.300
PEOPLE COME
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD

12:46.333 --> 12:48.035
TO EAT AT BILLY'S.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.070
SO WHY NOT STICK AROUND
FOR A MINUTE?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.539
YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID.

12:52.572 --> 12:55.842
- BILLY'S DELI,
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD TOILET.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.444
- NOW I NEEDED TO SEE
IF THE COMMERCIAL

12:57.544 --> 12:58.712
DID ITS JOB.

12:58.745 --> 12:59.913
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

12:59.946 --> 13:02.382
- UH, A LITTLE BIT.

13:02.416 --> 13:03.917
- SO WE HAVE A FULL MENU.
- YEAH.

13:03.950 --> 13:04.918
- YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.821
ALSO, UH,
WE NEED YOU TO SIGN, UH,

13:07.854 --> 13:10.457
IF YOU WOULD,
A-AN APPEARANCE RELEASE.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.159
WE WERE FILMING YOU
IN THE BATHROOM

13:12.192 --> 13:13.560
WITH A HIDDEN CAMERA...
- OH, REALLY?

13:13.593 --> 13:15.228
- TO SHOW
THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.197
- WHICH PART OF ME
WAS BEING FILMED?

13:17.230 --> 13:18.832
- JUST YOU
WATCHING THE VIDEO.

13:18.865 --> 13:21.201
- OH, OKAY,
BECAUSE I'M USING THE RESTROOM.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.503
SO I'M WONDERING
WHAT PART OF IT--

13:23.537 --> 13:24.871
- YEAH, YOUR PRIVATE PARTS
WON'T BE SHOWN.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.006
- OH, OKAY.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.240
- YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME
THAT YOU GUYS

13:27.274 --> 13:28.809
ARE GOING TO FILM.
YOU DIDN'T.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.711
NOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DELETE THIS THING.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.512
AND I DON'T CARE
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO USE.

13:32.546 --> 13:33.780
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

13:33.814 --> 13:35.115
- THE IMPORTANT THING IS--
I JUST WANT TO KNOW--

13:35.148 --> 13:36.516
- THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING
FOR ME.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.218
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA EAT
TODAY AT BILLY'S, BECAUSE--

13:38.251 --> 13:39.319
- AND IT'S A--
YOU'RE PLAYING

13:39.353 --> 13:41.021
REALLY A DANGEROUS GAME
RIGHT NOW.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.089
- OKAY, I'M SORRY.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.123
WE WERE FILMING YOU

13:43.156 --> 13:44.157
WHILE YOU WERE USING
THE BATHROOM.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.292
- OH, OKAY.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.893
- SO WE NEED TO, UH,
GET YOU TO SIGN

13:46.927 --> 13:48.695
THIS RELEASE SO WE CAN USE
THE FOOTAGE

13:48.729 --> 13:49.796
ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

13:49.830 --> 13:50.797
- OH.
- IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

13:50.831 --> 13:51.965
- SURE.
- IS THAT OKAY?

13:51.999 --> 13:54.067
- OKAY, YEAH, SURE.
- OKAY, THANKS SO MUCH.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.636
I MEAN, IT BASICALLY SAYS
WE CAN DO ANYTHING WE WANT

13:55.669 --> 13:57.704
WITH THE FOOTAGE
AND USE IT FOR ANYTHING.

13:57.738 --> 13:58.872
- OH, OKAY, RIGHT.
- OKAY.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.040
FOR THE MOST PART,

14:00.073 --> 14:02.275
THE IN-BATHROOM FILMING
WASN'T A PROBLEM,

14:02.309 --> 14:04.578
AND PEOPLE WERE HAPPY
TO SIGN THE RELEASE.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.247
AND I WAS SO EXCITED
TO SHOW GLORIA MY RESULTS.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.682
THIS MAN...

14:08.715 --> 14:11.251
YOU CAN SEE HIM
IN THE BATHROOM.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.587
- MM-HMM.
- NOW LOOK OVER THERE.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.322
- UH-HUH.
- HE'S EATING.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.590
- OH, YEAH.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.991
- SEE THIS MAN HERE?
- THIS MAN, MM-HMM.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.726
- HE'S AT THE URINAL.
- MM-HMM.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.894
- LOOK RIGHT THERE.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.062
- UH-HUH.
- HE'S EATING A MEAL.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.231
- YES, MM-HMM.
- PRETTY AMAZING.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.301
- UH-HUH, THAT'S GOOD.
- MY IDEA WAS A SUCCESS.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.504
EVERYTHING GOOD?
UP TO YOUR STANDARDS?

14:30.504 --> 14:31.605
GOOD.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.774
AND SEEING THAT SMILE
ON GLORIA'S FACE

14:33.807 --> 14:35.776
MADE IT ALL WORTH IT
FOR ME.

14:35.809 --> 14:38.211
WELL, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT EVERYTHING?

14:42.616 --> 14:44.284
- I MEAN, WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER
SO MUCH THIS WEEK, RIGHT?

14:44.318 --> 14:45.852
- UH-HUH, YES.
- AND IN A WAY,

14:45.886 --> 14:48.855
YOU PROBABLY SEE ME
AS A SON.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.424
I MEAN,
WE'RE KIND OF LIKE FAMILY.

14:50.524 --> 14:54.995
I'M LIKE YOUR SON.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.263
- YES, IT'S LIKE THAT.
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.764
- YES.
- YES.

14:57.798 --> 14:59.132
- WELL, NOT TO BE
TOO FORWARD,

14:59.166 --> 15:02.169
BUT I WOULD LOVE
TO BE INCLUDED IN YOUR WILL.

15:04.638 --> 15:06.106
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.874
- YOU THINK IT'S A POSSIBILITY
THAT YOU--

15:07.908 --> 15:09.710
- UM...

15:09.743 --> 15:10.711
- YOUR DAUGHTER?

15:10.744 --> 15:11.812
OF COURSE,
SHE HAS TO COME FIRST.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.213
- SHE IS STARTING.
SHE'S YOUNG.

15:17.751 --> 15:18.986
- MAYBE? YOU'LL THINK ABOUT IT?
- YEAH, YES.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.921
- OKAY, I'LL GIVE YOU
SOME TIME TO THINK.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.689
I DON'T WANT TO PRESSURE YOU.
- OKAY.

15:22.723 --> 15:24.391
- I'M VERY EXCITED.
- OKAY.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.826
- I MEAN, I MIGHT BE
THE NEW OWNER.

15:25.859 --> 15:26.994
- I KNOW.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.295
- I WAS SO EXCITED,

15:28.328 --> 15:29.863
AND I COULDN'T WAIT
TO FIND OUT

15:29.896 --> 15:32.532
IF I'D BE INCLUDED
IN GLORIA'S WILL.

15:36.460 --> 15:37.600
- EARLIER TONIGHT,

15:37.630 --> 15:40.170
I SHOWED YOU
HOW I RESEARCH BUSINESSES,

15:40.200 --> 15:42.500
A PROCESS THAT INVOLVES
A LOT OF WAITING AND WATCHING.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.270
IT CAN BE
KIND OF TEDIOUS,

15:44.310 --> 15:45.970
SO I'D BEEN THINKING
OF GETTING SOMEONE

15:46.010 --> 15:47.070
TO HELP ME OUT,

15:47.110 --> 15:48.280
AND I RECENTLY MET SOMEONE

15:48.310 --> 15:51.210
WHO BASICALLY WATCHES BUSINESSES
FOR A LIVING.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.410
SO I CALLED SIMON
INTO MY OFFICE

15:52.450 --> 15:54.180
TO SEE IF HE'D BE WILLING
TO TAKE ON

15:54.220 --> 15:55.280
A SECOND JOB.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.520
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
TO HELP OUT

15:57.550 --> 15:59.090
WITH SOME OF THE RESEARCHING
TASKS...

15:59.120 --> 16:00.720
- OH, OKAY.
- OF MY SHOW.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.090
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S YOUR SKILL SET?

16:02.120 --> 16:03.090
- UH, YES.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.630
- NOW, I DO KNOW YOU HAVE
A VICE.

16:05.660 --> 16:06.630
- MM-HMM.
- RIGHT?

16:06.660 --> 16:08.060
- YEAH.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.460
- WOMEN WITH--

16:09.500 --> 16:10.600
- WITH, UH,
WITH--WITH LARGE--

16:10.630 --> 16:11.970
LARGE CHESTS, YEAH.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.100
- I MEAN, YOU LOVE THAT.
- RIGHT.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.300
- I MEAN, HOW MUCH?

16:15.340 --> 16:18.210
- UM, JUST--I WOULD SAY
THAT I DREAM ABOUT IT

16:18.240 --> 16:19.310
OR THINK ABOUT IT,
YOU KNOW,

16:19.340 --> 16:20.910
LIKE, ALMOST EVERY DAY
OF THE WEEK.

16:20.940 --> 16:23.140
- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT?

16:23.180 --> 16:25.310
- I JUST THINK ABOUT, LIKE,
FONDLING OR TOUCHING.

16:25.350 --> 16:27.250
YEAH.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.380
- SO IF I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THIS JOB,

16:29.420 --> 16:32.420
I NEED TO KNOW
THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE--

16:32.450 --> 16:34.290
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET YOURSELF
GET DISTRACTED BY THAT.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.920
- NO, I WON'T.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.390
- OKAY, GREAT.
- OKAY. COOL.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.460
- LET'S DO IT.
- THANKS, NATHAN.

16:38.490 --> 16:39.460
- THANKS, SIMON.

16:39.490 --> 16:41.160
I TOLD SIMON
THAT I WANTED HIM

16:41.200 --> 16:42.830
TO COVERTLY RESEARCH
A BUSINESS

16:42.830 --> 16:45.630
I WAS PLANNING ON HELPING
FOR MY SHOW.

16:45.670 --> 16:48.600
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S LOCK IT UP.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.970
WHAT SIMON DIDN'T KNOW

16:50.000 --> 16:52.870
IS THAT THIS WAS A TEST.

16:52.910 --> 16:53.870
- OH, YOU OKAY?

16:53.910 --> 16:55.010
- SORRY.
- I'M ALL RIGHT.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.840
- I HAD A LOCAL
CONVENIENCE STORE OWNER

16:56.840 --> 16:58.850
IN ON IT,
SO I COULD OBSERVE SIMON

16:58.850 --> 17:00.650
AND SEE WHAT HE WOULD DO.

17:00.680 --> 17:01.920
OBSERVE THE BUSINESS.

17:01.950 --> 17:03.620
LOOK FOR ANY PROBLEMS
OR ANYTHING THAT YOU SEE.

17:03.650 --> 17:04.990
- RIGHT.
- YOU GOT IT?

17:05.020 --> 17:06.750
- I GOT IT.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

17:06.849 --> 17:09.589
SIMON THOUGHT I WAS JUST
DROPPING HIM OFF AND LEAVING,

17:09.619 --> 17:12.690
BUT REALLY I HAD A PLAN
TO COVERTLY RE-ENTER THE STORE

17:12.730 --> 17:16.000
AND WATCH MY TEST UNFOLD.

17:16.030 --> 17:17.130
I NEVER REALLY USE IT

17:17.160 --> 17:18.700
BECAUSE THE ARCADE
IS MORE COMFORTABLE,

17:18.730 --> 17:20.970
BUT THIS CUSTOM-MADE
CIGAR STORE INDIAN

17:21.000 --> 17:22.700
HAS A HOLLOWED-OUT INTERIOR

17:22.740 --> 17:25.170
JUST BIG ENOUGH
TO FIT MY BODY.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.830
AFTER 30 MINUTES
IN THE ARCADE,

17:46.830 --> 17:48.130
HE SEEMED
TO BE DOING GREAT.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.660
BUT I WANTED TO TEST
SIMON'S FOCUS

17:49.700 --> 17:52.230
WITH A TRUE DISTRACTION:

17:52.270 --> 17:55.270
A PAIR OF HIS COVETED
DOUBLE D's.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.050
I COULDN'T BLAME SIMON
FOR TAKING A PEEK.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.050
BUT I WAS PLEASED HE QUICKLY GOT
BACK TO HIS DUTIES

18:07.080 --> 18:09.920
WITHOUT BLOWING HIS COVER
OR MASTURBATING.

18:09.950 --> 18:12.350
BUT I HAD ONE MORE TEST
IN STORE.

18:12.390 --> 18:14.220
I NEEDED TO KNOW THAT SIMON
WOULDN'T BLOW HIS COVER

18:14.260 --> 18:17.260
EVEN IN THE FACE OF DEATH.

18:19.430 --> 18:20.930
- I HAD ONE MORE TEST
OF SIMON'S LOYALTY,

18:20.960 --> 18:22.560
A LIFE-OR-DEATH SCENARIO

18:22.600 --> 18:25.070
PLANNED OUT
WITH A PROFESSIONAL ACTOR.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.370
- THE LIBRARIAN'S QUEST?

18:26.400 --> 18:27.700
I BEEN LOOKING
FOR ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

18:27.730 --> 18:29.540
- OH, YOU HAVE?
- HOW MUCH YOU WANT FOR IT?

18:32.140 --> 18:36.080
- WELL, COULD I HAVE IT?

18:36.110 --> 18:37.440
YEAH?

18:38.750 --> 18:40.480
YOU KNOW, IT'S A LITTLE BIG
FOR MY CAR,

18:40.510 --> 18:42.420
SO I MIGHT HAVE TO CUT IT
IN HALF.

18:42.450 --> 18:45.920
DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE
A SAW?

18:45.950 --> 18:46.950
- THERE YOU GO.

18:46.990 --> 18:48.260
YEAH.

18:48.290 --> 18:49.420
THAT'LL WORK. THANKS.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:49.460 --> 18:50.420
- GEEZ.

18:53.730 --> 18:55.300
TIME TO CUT THIS BABY
IN HALF.

18:55.330 --> 18:56.330
- UH-HUH.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.950
- THANK YOU.

19:11.980 --> 19:13.980
THANK YOU.

19:14.010 --> 19:15.020
THANK YOU, DON.

19:15.050 --> 19:16.150
- YEAH, MY PLEASURE, MAN.

19:16.180 --> 19:17.920
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
ALL RIGHT, SIMON?

19:17.950 --> 19:19.820
- YEAH.
- HOW YOU DOING IN THERE?

19:19.850 --> 19:21.460
- I'M OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

19:21.490 --> 19:23.690
THAT WAS A TEST,
AND YOU PASSED.

19:23.720 --> 19:24.990
- OKAY.

19:25.030 --> 19:26.060
- SIMON DID AMAZING.

19:26.090 --> 19:27.630
ANY OTHER MAN
UNDER THAT CIRCUMSTANCE

19:27.660 --> 19:29.330
WOULD'VE BLOWN HIS COVER.

19:29.330 --> 19:30.460
YOU'RE PROBABLY NERVOUS
RIGHT NOW.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.500
- OH.
- YOU PROBABLY NEED A HUG.

19:31.530 --> 19:32.570
- YEAH.
- YOU OKAY?

19:32.600 --> 19:33.970
- IT'S--IT WAS--
IT WAS A LITTLE--

19:34.000 --> 19:35.600
IT WAS A LITTLE NERVE-WRACKING,
BUT YEAH, I'M OKAY.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.070
- WELL, YOU DID GREAT, MAN.
- OKAY.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.810
- CONGRATS.
- COOL. YEAH.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.670
ALL RIGHT.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.610
- I WAS TRULY IMPRESSED
BY SIMON,

19:42.640 --> 19:45.610
AND IT FELT GOOD KNOWING
I HAD SOMEONE I COULD COUNT ON.

19:45.650 --> 19:47.910
UNFORTUNATELY, I COULDN'T SAY
THE SAME FOR GLORIA,

19:47.950 --> 19:50.420
AS SHE CHOSE NOT TO INCLUDE ME
IN HER WILL.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.930
- BUT UNLIKE GLORIA,
I NEVER FORGET TO REWARD THOSE

20:01.960 --> 20:03.000
THAT HELP ME OUT.

20:03.030 --> 20:04.660
BECAUSE YOU WERE SO GREAT,

20:04.700 --> 20:06.070
I HAVE A SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.170
- OH.
- YEAH.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.370
- OKAY.

20:08.370 --> 20:09.970
- I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO SOMEONE.

20:10.000 --> 20:10.970
- OKAY.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.610
- BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME

20:12.640 --> 20:13.670
TO BE A GENTLEMAN.

20:13.710 --> 20:14.780
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

20:14.810 --> 20:16.780
- YES.

20:16.810 --> 20:19.810
- TRISHA.

20:21.880 --> 20:22.850
- HI.
- HI.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.790
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. GOOD.

20:25.820 --> 20:26.820
- HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.520
- NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.320
- VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.690
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

20:32.730 --> 20:34.130
- WOW.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.700
- HEY.

20:35.730 --> 20:38.970
- OKAY.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.740
- I WAS SO HAPPY
FOR SIMON.

20:43.770 --> 20:46.840
BUT WHILE I WAS WATCHING HIM
CONNECT WITH TRISHA,

20:46.870 --> 20:47.870
I COULDN'T HELP
BUT FEEL JEALOUS

20:47.910 --> 20:49.410
BECAUSE I WANTED
THAT SAME CONNECTION

20:49.440 --> 20:51.410
IN MY OWN LIFE.

20:51.450 --> 20:54.820
OH, WELL.
MORE BUSINESSES NEXT WEEK.

20:54.850 --> 20:57.180
- AB-SO-LUTELY.

21:01.290 --> 21:02.390
- MOST OF THE GIRLS
I'VE BEEN WITH

21:02.420 --> 21:03.520
HAVEN'T BEEN THAT--
THAT LARGE.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.790
- HAVE YOU EVER TALKED

21:04.820 --> 21:07.230
ABOUT ASKING THEM
TO GET IMPLANTS OR ANYTHING?

21:07.260 --> 21:09.000
- IF WE WERE WATCHING TV
AND THERE WAS A TV COMMERCIAL,

21:09.030 --> 21:10.400
LIKE, FOR--FOR IMPLANTS,
I WOULD SAY,

21:10.430 --> 21:11.800
"HEY, LOOK AT THAT,"
YOU KNOW.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.200
"THAT--THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD."

21:13.230 --> 21:15.170
- AND DID THEY EVER DO IT?
- NO.
