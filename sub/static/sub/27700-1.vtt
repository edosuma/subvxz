[Michael]
<i>Joe?</i>

02:59.944 --> 03:02.181
<i>Joe?</i>

03:03.248 --> 03:04.680
Joe?

03:04.682 --> 03:06.451
Have a seat.

03:16.895 --> 03:19.829
Do you think those shoes
are appropriate for a funeral?

03:19.831 --> 03:22.031
Well, they're black, Joe.

03:22.033 --> 03:23.834
As are my pants and shirt.

03:23.836 --> 03:25.602
- You're not working out?
- You know I'm not.

03:25.604 --> 03:27.671
If you worked out,
you would dress better.

03:27.673 --> 03:30.440
Put on a tie.
Better shoes.

03:30.442 --> 03:34.710
Workouts build
self-respect.

03:34.712 --> 03:36.613
Are you saying
I don't have self-respect?

03:36.615 --> 03:38.548
I'm saying you dress
like someone

03:38.550 --> 03:41.050
who has no respect
for their appearance.

03:41.052 --> 03:42.985
Appearance isn't everything,
Joe. I'm a writer.

03:42.987 --> 03:45.858
Let's hope you write
better than you look.

03:47.759 --> 03:51.394
Well, Joe, I know you must
be devastated.

03:51.396 --> 03:52.895
This must be very hard
for you.

03:52.897 --> 03:57.601
My brother was my best friend
for more than 80 years.

03:57.603 --> 04:00.671
He was nominated
for the Nobel Peace Prize.

04:00.673 --> 04:04.541
Received the Order of Canada,
French Legion of Honor.

04:04.543 --> 04:07.610
And he figured out that
Napoleon was poisoned.

04:07.612 --> 04:10.513
All that genius, and he always
kept up with his workouts.

04:10.515 --> 04:15.484
Joe, respectfully,
can we move on?

04:15.486 --> 04:16.853
Yes.

04:16.855 --> 04:19.492
- I believe we should.
- Good.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.433
Joe, I got to tell you,

04:29.435 --> 04:30.733
I'm puzzled
by something.

04:30.735 --> 04:32.635
I spent a month straight
at your house,

04:32.637 --> 04:35.438
listening to you talk about
the right ratio

04:35.440 --> 04:36.906
of egg whites to egg yolks.

04:36.908 --> 04:37.940
Multivitamins.

04:37.942 --> 04:39.476
Watching the damn
History Channel.

04:39.478 --> 04:41.610
And then today,
today of all days,

04:41.612 --> 04:45.414
the day of your brother's
funeral...

04:45.416 --> 04:46.916
you want to work.

04:46.918 --> 04:48.854
Why is that?

04:50.622 --> 04:52.522
Bennie's gone now.

04:52.524 --> 04:54.894
That's why.

04:55.793 --> 04:58.430
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

04:59.497 --> 05:00.563
Let's...

05:00.565 --> 05:02.598
let's start
with your childhood.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.401
You and Ben growing up
in the Jewish ghetto, Montreal.

05:05.403 --> 05:06.635
Mm.

05:06.637 --> 05:08.671
Not "our" beginning.

05:08.673 --> 05:10.574
Let's start with mine.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.976
- [screaming]
- [doctor] Push! Push!

05:12.978 --> 05:14.678
- God!
- [doctor] Push. Harder. Harder.

05:14.680 --> 05:16.680
- Come, come.
- [groaning]

05:16.682 --> 05:19.416
Harder. Harder.
Push, push.

05:19.418 --> 05:21.418
- [gasps]
- [cries]

05:21.420 --> 05:24.557
[laughs]

05:25.456 --> 05:27.858
Oh, baby.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.026
Congratulations.

05:30.028 --> 05:33.430
- [cries]
- What is this?

05:33.432 --> 05:34.563
A penis.

05:34.565 --> 05:37.000
This is not my baby.

05:37.002 --> 05:39.435
- This is not my baby.
- Anna, please.

05:39.437 --> 05:40.437
Give me my baby girl.

05:40.439 --> 05:45.142
Give me my baby girl.
Give me my baby girl.

05:45.144 --> 05:47.944
Give me my baby girl!

05:47.946 --> 05:49.478
She was my mother,

05:49.480 --> 05:52.815
and we were stuck together,
for better or for worse.

05:52.817 --> 05:56.519
Some say that she was
just mean,

05:56.521 --> 05:58.721
but she had a hard life.

05:58.723 --> 06:02.625
She certainly wasn't making mine
any easier.

06:02.627 --> 06:04.928
And then my brother Bennie
came along.

06:04.930 --> 06:08.764
<i>And having him on my side
changed everything for me.</i>

06:08.766 --> 06:11.570
- [indistinct chatter]
- [elephant trumpets]

06:19.177 --> 06:21.680
[cheers and applause]

06:30.588 --> 06:33.658
[woman]
He's so strong.

07:01.519 --> 07:03.887
[sobs softly]

07:03.889 --> 07:05.591
[laughing]

07:07.559 --> 07:09.962
What have you done?

07:11.062 --> 07:13.128
Get here now.

07:13.130 --> 07:15.999
Both of you!

07:18.202 --> 07:20.103
Come here.

07:20.105 --> 07:22.040
Turn around.

07:23.675 --> 07:27.013
How dare you come
back to me so dirty.

07:29.781 --> 07:32.515
- [belt slaps]
- [whimpering]

07:32.517 --> 07:35.187
[grunts and sobs]

07:46.531 --> 07:48.964
You still look good, Ben.

07:48.966 --> 07:52.836
Better than a lot of our
friends still mulling around.

07:52.838 --> 07:56.075
We did all right, Ben.

08:05.716 --> 08:07.651
Pretty good tri's,
young man.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.819
You do parallel
bar dips,

08:09.821 --> 08:12.923
French presses
or barbell extensions?

08:12.925 --> 08:16.192
I just fold and unfold a lot
of chairs here every day, sir.

08:16.194 --> 08:18.127
Really? Interesting.

08:18.129 --> 08:20.065
Show me.

08:23.302 --> 08:24.700
Yeah.

08:24.702 --> 08:26.670
You got pretty good
genetics.

08:26.672 --> 08:27.937
Imagine what
you'd look like

08:27.939 --> 08:30.642
if your legs caught up
with your arms.

08:32.177 --> 08:34.945
So you said you called
yourselves the "alley rats".

08:34.947 --> 08:36.645
That's who we were.

08:36.648 --> 08:39.715
We would do any job
we could find for a nickel.

08:39.717 --> 08:41.217
We were like alley rats,

08:41.219 --> 08:46.323
scampered from one dingy house
to another dingy house.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.728
Alley rats.

08:55.299 --> 08:57.235
[in French]

08:59.303 --> 09:01.673

[boys laugh]

09:34.873 --> 09:37.043
Where are you going?

09:40.177 --> 09:41.746
Hmm?

09:50.389 --> 09:51.820
Where is the rest?

09:51.822 --> 09:54.757
Kids stole it.

09:54.759 --> 09:57.326
You let them take it?
Look at me.

09:57.328 --> 09:58.862
Look at me.

09:58.864 --> 10:00.729
You let them take it?

10:00.731 --> 10:01.830
Hmm?

10:01.832 --> 10:04.903
Hey, I'm talking
to you.

10:06.705 --> 10:09.075
I've got nothing to add.

10:13.378 --> 10:15.177
Oh! Ugh!

10:15.179 --> 10:17.946
[sniffles]

10:17.948 --> 10:21.886
I should toss you away
like this.

10:24.255 --> 10:25.821
Get out of here.

10:25.823 --> 10:28.293
Get out. Go.

10:55.986 --> 10:58.954
They say if you are born
to the iron,

10:58.956 --> 11:02.061
you know it
the first time you lift.

11:15.373 --> 11:16.739
You want to try it?

11:16.741 --> 11:17.940
What for?

11:17.942 --> 11:19.743
This is how you get bigger.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.143
Why would I want
to get bigger?

11:21.145 --> 11:23.912
Because when you're big,
nobody puts their hands on you.

11:23.914 --> 11:26.015
Why not take up boxing?

11:26.017 --> 11:29.221
Because I'm tired
of getting hit.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.836
[strains and grunts]

11:51.076 --> 11:51.775
Good.

11:51.777 --> 11:54.410
Good? I barely
did it once.

11:54.412 --> 11:59.418
That's one more time than
you've ever done before, Bennie.

12:18.169 --> 12:20.205
[grunts]

12:23.307 --> 12:24.507
[laughs]

12:24.509 --> 12:26.946
[spectators clap]

12:33.918 --> 12:35.584
[Louis]
Your brother.

12:35.586 --> 12:37.286
Look at your brother!

12:37.288 --> 12:42.392
Anna, Joseph has worked
so hard for us, for this.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.026
He won something.

12:44.028 --> 12:46.262
He won something
for us!

12:46.264 --> 12:47.964
No.

12:47.966 --> 12:50.032
This is embarrassing.

12:50.034 --> 12:52.234
He spends his time lifting
a bunch of junk in the air

12:52.236 --> 12:54.036
again and again
for bumps on his arms?

12:54.038 --> 12:55.238
[Louis]
Don't say that.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.141
If our son continues like this,
he will amount to nothing.

12:58.143 --> 12:59.541
- No.
- And you want to encourage him!

12:59.543 --> 13:02.478
No, no, I... that is not true.
Please, don't do this.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.147
[Anna]
You know what Stella Vernieu

13:04.149 --> 13:05.382
said to me in the market
last week?

13:05.384 --> 13:08.884
She said, "I saw your son, Joe,
and he looked like Tarzan."

13:08.886 --> 13:10.288
Tarzan!

13:25.604 --> 13:27.439
[sobs]

13:29.975 --> 13:32.941
Oh, I tried.

13:32.943 --> 13:34.579
It's not your fault, Pa.

13:39.017 --> 13:40.552
[sighs]

13:41.919 --> 13:43.521
Yours.

13:45.990 --> 13:48.026
No, you...
you keep it.

13:49.094 --> 13:51.129
It's for you.

13:52.931 --> 13:54.600
Come.

13:56.934 --> 13:58.503
[sighs]

14:04.142 --> 14:06.579
You take care
of your brother.

14:13.585 --> 14:16.088
[car starts]

14:24.129 --> 14:26.197
[wind whistling]

14:27.197 --> 14:30.101
[laughter and indistinct
chatter]

14:38.943 --> 14:41.012
[laughter continuous]

14:43.414 --> 14:46.517
- [boy 1] Go, go, go.
- [boy 2] Ready? Let's go.

14:59.264 --> 15:02.234
[object dragging
and scraping]

15:03.969 --> 15:07.172
[Joe grunting]

15:10.075 --> 15:11.974
So big Joe
needs some help, huh?

15:11.976 --> 15:13.475
So you're a funny man now
with the jokes.

15:13.477 --> 15:16.244
- Come on, help me with this.
- Why do need an icebox?

15:16.246 --> 15:18.547
So we don't have to keep food
in the snow to keep it cold.

15:18.549 --> 15:22.153
- Come on, help me.
- [sighs]

15:24.522 --> 15:25.988
Up.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.659
[grunts]

15:29.660 --> 15:32.027
That's good.
Get some exercise.

15:32.029 --> 15:33.729
Yeah, at 3:00
in the morning.

15:33.731 --> 15:35.430
[both muttering]

15:35.432 --> 15:38.700
It's always a good time.
Never a bad time.

15:38.702 --> 15:40.069
[grunts]

15:40.071 --> 15:41.473
Okay...

15:45.442 --> 15:47.346
[inaudible]

16:18.176 --> 16:19.711
[clears throat]

16:20.778 --> 16:22.310
I'm sorry.

16:22.312 --> 16:25.317
I've been...
I've been watching you.

16:26.183 --> 16:27.783
What are you drawing?

16:27.785 --> 16:29.786
Oh, um...

16:29.788 --> 16:32.291
the human figure.

16:33.357 --> 16:35.690
- Do you mind if I...?
- Of course.

16:35.692 --> 16:37.660
Okay.

16:37.662 --> 16:39.161
Wow.

16:39.163 --> 16:41.699
That is very impressive.

16:44.068 --> 16:45.267
Has anyone
ever told you

16:45.269 --> 16:48.307
that you have
a nice chin?

16:49.173 --> 16:50.506
- Chin?
- Mm-hmm.

16:50.508 --> 16:51.706
No.

16:51.708 --> 16:54.209
It comes to a perfect point
when you smile.

16:54.211 --> 16:56.278
- Oh, thank you.
- You don't smoke, do you?

16:56.280 --> 16:58.080
- No.
- No, no, I could tell.

16:58.082 --> 17:01.316
You have beautiful skin,
and you smell very good too.

17:01.318 --> 17:06.189
Oh, my. Thank you again,
I guess.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.123
Would you like
to get some coffee?

17:08.125 --> 17:09.257
- Now?
- Sure, now.

17:09.259 --> 17:13.296
I... I don't get off
until 8:00.

17:13.298 --> 17:16.431
What is your name,
by the way?

17:16.433 --> 17:18.237
I'm Joe.

17:19.203 --> 17:21.103
Joe.

17:21.105 --> 17:23.275
I'm Kathy.

17:25.276 --> 17:27.246
I will wait outside.

17:28.113 --> 17:30.179
- Okay.
- 8:00.

17:30.181 --> 17:31.713
8:00.

17:31.715 --> 17:33.584
I'll see you then.

17:38.222 --> 17:40.526
- [Kathy] Hi.
- [Joe] Hi.

17:41.726 --> 17:43.625
Do you like to walk?

17:43.627 --> 17:44.826
Yes.

17:44.828 --> 17:46.261
I love to walk.

17:46.263 --> 17:49.431
All right.

17:49.433 --> 17:51.433
I see you studying
at the library all the time.

17:51.435 --> 17:53.736
Do you go
to the university?

17:53.738 --> 17:55.203
No, no. You?

17:55.205 --> 17:56.404
- No.
- No.

17:56.406 --> 17:59.674
And I'm not studying.
I'm creating.

17:59.676 --> 18:01.309
Creating what?

18:01.311 --> 18:04.380
The path to a perfect
physique.

18:04.382 --> 18:07.753
Looks like you've already
done that.

18:09.453 --> 18:12.154
All right, what do you
do for fun?

18:12.156 --> 18:14.323
Oh. Fun.

18:14.325 --> 18:15.557
It's not a foreign word.

18:15.559 --> 18:19.364
No, no, but...
no, I just told you.

18:20.365 --> 18:22.331
So for fun,
you draw and write

18:22.333 --> 18:24.299
about how to have
a nice physique?

18:24.301 --> 18:25.334
Oh, no, no.
Not nice.

18:25.336 --> 18:29.238
More powerful,
more beautiful.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.405
The human body
is incredible.

18:30.407 --> 18:32.807
And most people,
they do nothing with it.

18:32.809 --> 18:36.312
They treat it like junk.

18:36.314 --> 18:37.813
So that's your hobby?

18:37.815 --> 18:39.949
The body?

18:39.951 --> 18:42.285
Who has time for hobbies?

18:42.287 --> 18:43.419
The body is
the ultimate machine.

18:43.421 --> 18:44.953
You have the power
to make it perfect.

18:44.955 --> 18:48.257
You have to work it right,
treat it right, feed it right.

18:48.259 --> 18:50.192
Same as you would
a racehorse.

18:50.194 --> 18:51.393
[laughs]

18:51.395 --> 18:53.461
What? What's funny?

18:53.463 --> 18:55.965
You eat the same
as a racehorse?

18:55.967 --> 18:57.100
- No. Well...
- [laughs]

18:57.102 --> 19:02.341
...maybe not exactly the same,
but probably as often.

19:04.209 --> 19:05.440
Is that a smile?

19:05.442 --> 19:08.411
The best I can do.
I...

19:08.413 --> 19:11.383
I've been told
I need practice.

19:20.924 --> 19:22.693
Well, look at that.

19:31.368 --> 19:33.936
<i>♪ Do I want you? ♪</i>

19:33.938 --> 19:37.239

20:03.367 --> 20:07.269

20:10.474 --> 20:12.877
I'll get a coffee.

20:17.481 --> 20:19.649
Have you been there before?

20:19.651 --> 20:21.017
Joe.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.884
Can we get some water?

20:22.886 --> 20:24.855
Come here.

20:27.357 --> 20:28.894
Sit down.

20:30.595 --> 20:32.495
You didn't fill out
your application completely.

20:32.497 --> 20:34.363
Oh, I believe
that I did.

20:34.365 --> 20:35.331
Religious affiliation.

20:35.333 --> 20:36.565
Oh, um...

20:36.567 --> 20:39.605
I didn't think
that one mattered.

20:41.071 --> 20:42.840
Weider?

20:45.309 --> 20:46.842
You're not a Jew,
are you?

20:46.844 --> 20:48.510
Murray's policy
is no Jews.

20:48.512 --> 20:52.914
Oh, I did not know
about that policy.

20:52.916 --> 20:54.519
Damn.

20:57.387 --> 20:58.821
All right,
I'm going to keep you,

20:58.823 --> 21:01.356
but only because
you work as hard as three guys.

21:01.358 --> 21:04.927
But I am going to list you down
here as Roman Catholic.

21:04.929 --> 21:06.528
You can write down
anything you want

21:06.530 --> 21:09.364
if it means I, you know,
come back tomorrow.

21:09.366 --> 21:11.467
For now.

21:11.469 --> 21:14.402
Wait, Joe.
Another thing.

21:14.404 --> 21:15.470
Huh?

21:15.472 --> 21:16.838
Sit down, sit.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.475
These drawings that you've been
doing on your breaks,

21:19.477 --> 21:22.944
these weird body pictures
that people are talking about...

21:22.946 --> 21:24.846
what are you,
like a Michelangelo?

21:24.848 --> 21:25.980
No, no. I wish.

21:25.982 --> 21:29.553
You wish?
Michelangelo was a buggerer.

21:32.490 --> 21:35.091
You're not a buggerer,
are you?

21:35.093 --> 21:37.559
- No. No, I'm not.
- Good.

21:37.561 --> 21:40.830
Because the only thing worse
than a Jew is a buggerer.

21:40.832 --> 21:43.399
And the only thing
worse than a buggerer

21:43.401 --> 21:45.133
is a Jew buggerer.

21:45.135 --> 21:46.501
Got it, yeah.

21:46.503 --> 21:48.504
Good thing I'm not
colored then, huh?

21:48.506 --> 21:50.005
- You being a swellhead with me?
- No.

21:50.007 --> 21:52.674
Just don't do your pictures
around here no more,

21:52.676 --> 21:54.376
and don't bring them in
to work.

21:54.378 --> 21:55.510
You got it?

21:55.512 --> 21:56.478
I'm doing the sketches

21:56.480 --> 21:58.646
because I'm putting
together a newsletter

21:58.648 --> 22:00.449
about the human physique.

22:00.451 --> 22:01.650
- About what?
- The physiques.

22:01.652 --> 22:03.552
The art and science
of the body.

22:03.554 --> 22:05.153
Just keep it to yourself.
Period.

22:05.155 --> 22:07.088
All right.

22:07.090 --> 22:09.093
Go.

22:12.963 --> 22:15.597
Hey, Weider.

22:15.599 --> 22:17.533
I got a pie that didn't
sell today.

22:17.535 --> 22:19.067
You want it?

22:19.069 --> 22:20.536
- Uh...
- Oh, come on.

22:20.538 --> 22:22.438
It's a perk for being
a non-Jew.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.573
[chuckles]

22:23.575 --> 22:26.478
Seriously, you can give it
to your wife or something.

22:35.586 --> 22:37.819
Oh! Oh, shit.
That's my fault.

22:37.821 --> 22:41.659
Oh, well. You can still
have it if you want it.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.427
No. No, thank you.

22:44.429 --> 22:46.665
"N-N-N-No, thank you."

23:03.448 --> 23:05.517
Hey. Hey. Hey!

23:09.653 --> 23:13.622
The only thing worse
than a bastard

23:13.624 --> 23:15.857
is an anti-Semite bastard.

23:15.859 --> 23:21.463
And I don't work
for Jew-hating bastards.

23:21.465 --> 23:22.664
And you...

23:22.666 --> 23:24.699
you need to exercise,

23:24.701 --> 23:27.169
because you are a soft,
flabby man

23:27.171 --> 23:28.571
with no muscle tone.

23:28.573 --> 23:29.705
No strength at all.

23:29.707 --> 23:31.574
If you had any
self-respect,

23:31.576 --> 23:35.579
you'd find an activity for your
body and keep a proper diet.

23:36.646 --> 23:38.948
You're welcome.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.149
[door opens]

23:40.151 --> 23:41.584
[Ben]
I don't know why we can't focus

23:41.586 --> 23:42.518
on what we're doing here,

23:42.520 --> 23:44.119
and work on your dreams
in our spare time.

23:44.121 --> 23:46.488
We're doing terrific business.
Just look.

23:46.490 --> 23:48.192
Did you hear me, Joe?

23:51.628 --> 23:54.863
What is this?
Did you make this?

23:54.865 --> 23:57.266
How you put something
like this together?

23:57.268 --> 23:58.867
I saved up seven dollars.

23:58.869 --> 24:00.736
Most of that I spent
to send out postcards

24:00.738 --> 24:01.871
to people whose names
I got from the back of

24:01.873 --> 24:04.539
- <i>Strength and Health</i> magazine.
- What for?

24:04.541 --> 24:05.774
To get ideas and advice.

24:05.776 --> 24:06.709
I want to have a magazine
devoted to those

24:06.711 --> 24:08.710
- who build their bodies.
- You want to have

24:08.712 --> 24:10.613
a magazine about muscles?

24:10.615 --> 24:12.547
[laughs]

24:12.549 --> 24:14.517
Does Bill Hauk know?

24:14.519 --> 24:15.817
Bill Hauk's magazines

24:15.819 --> 24:17.620
are about feats of strength
and weight-lifting.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.521
Mine focuses on sculpting
the body, health and nutrition.

24:19.523 --> 24:22.190
Look at the publishers' names
on my rack.

24:22.192 --> 24:24.893
Bill Hauk. He has
all the great strongmen.

24:24.895 --> 24:28.296
The big-name guys.
They all work for him.

24:28.298 --> 24:29.632
My magazine is different.

24:29.634 --> 24:31.699
It's just better,
Mr. Young.

24:31.701 --> 24:33.001
It shows exercises
for everybody.

24:33.003 --> 24:35.136
Who's going to buy it?
And what makes you think

24:35.138 --> 24:37.539
that Bill Hauk's going to let
a young pisher like you

24:37.541 --> 24:39.741
make a magazine that will
compete with his?

24:39.743 --> 24:40.876
I have essays and pictures of
men training

24:40.878 --> 24:43.845
specific muscle groups,
isolation therapy, weight gain.

24:43.847 --> 24:46.849
Everything you need
to help yourself train.

24:46.851 --> 24:48.150
People need to work
on their own bodies.

24:48.152 --> 24:50.920
Boychick, you got
a lot of nerve picking names

24:50.922 --> 24:54.222
from the muscle king's
magazines.

24:54.224 --> 24:55.891
So who's going to read
about all this?

24:55.893 --> 24:58.294
Someday, everybody will.
I tell you what,

24:58.296 --> 25:00.828
keep the first 20 copies
of the magazine for free.

25:00.830 --> 25:01.665
Free?

25:03.701 --> 25:05.269
Nothing wrong with free.

25:07.805 --> 25:10.674
I'll bring back the rest.

25:28.792 --> 25:29.792
Joe?

25:29.794 --> 25:31.326
Where are we
supposed to eat?

25:31.328 --> 25:33.761
We can eat at the desk.

25:33.763 --> 25:35.096
You mean what used to be
my dining table?

25:35.098 --> 25:37.632
Yeah, yeah, it's perfect.
Everything fits.

25:37.634 --> 25:38.866
Hey, Bennie,
what's the situation

25:38.868 --> 25:41.036
with the strongman
here in Montreal?

25:41.038 --> 25:44.038
Claude Regine.
He's in Bill Hauk's magazine.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.841
I think he has
a contract with him.

25:45.843 --> 25:48.344
What about the weight-lifting
king, Jerry George?

25:48.346 --> 25:50.778
Called him already.
He's a partner of Hauk's.

25:50.780 --> 25:51.779
[Joe]
What is this, a damn union?

25:51.781 --> 25:53.815
Only one man is allowed
to publish his opinions

25:53.817 --> 25:54.816
on building muscle?

25:54.818 --> 25:56.785
Have you lost
your mind, Joe?

25:56.787 --> 25:59.156
I want all of this stuff
out of here!

26:04.394 --> 26:06.163
[door opens]

26:14.005 --> 26:15.138
What?

26:15.140 --> 26:17.271
We're making a magazine, Kathy.
This is what we wanted.

26:17.273 --> 26:20.042
"We"? What happened to the job
at Murray's, Joe?

26:20.044 --> 26:22.911
I can better people's lives
by bringing fitness into it.

26:22.913 --> 26:26.382
And you want me to serve
terrible food

26:26.384 --> 26:27.749
for an anti-Semite?

26:27.751 --> 26:28.917
Murray's isn't terrible food.

26:28.919 --> 26:30.853
It's normal food
for normal people!

26:30.855 --> 26:32.755
Normal people
who aren't obsessed

26:32.757 --> 26:34.323
with having a tight tummy.

26:34.325 --> 26:35.891
Well, someday,
because of our magazine,

26:35.893 --> 26:36.926
those will be
the normal people.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.798
This is pipe dreams
and a puff of smoke, Joe.

26:40.830 --> 26:42.698
You sound like my mother.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.769
Well, maybe she was
a realist.

26:46.804 --> 26:47.769
[sighs]

26:47.771 --> 26:50.773
Joe! Please, can we talk?

26:50.775 --> 26:52.908
I can go and get
some coffee.

26:52.910 --> 26:54.375
No.

26:54.377 --> 26:56.313
We'll talk outside.

27:02.686 --> 27:05.019
Joe...

27:05.021 --> 27:06.857
she's a good girl.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.267
Joe, you don't need to work
day and night on some magazine,

27:19.269 --> 27:22.874
or your research,
or even lift weights for me.

27:23.874 --> 27:26.874
I married you.

27:26.876 --> 27:30.080
I love you just the way
you are.

27:41.025 --> 27:45.864
That is the worst thing
you could ever say to me.

27:47.765 --> 27:49.864
[Joe] <i>Sad to say,
I didn't want to be loved</i>

27:49.866 --> 27:50.999
<i>for the person I was.</i>

27:51.001 --> 27:53.367
I wanted to be loved for
the person I wanted to become.

27:53.369 --> 27:56.971
I had big dreams.
I wanted to...

27:56.973 --> 27:59.343
I wanted something bigger.

28:00.810 --> 28:03.947
And so I knew...

28:06.450 --> 28:08.886
you know, the marriage...

28:09.953 --> 28:13.287
the marriage had to end.

28:13.289 --> 28:16.057
The whole point of marriage
is that two people come together

28:16.059 --> 28:18.126
and create
something special.

28:18.128 --> 28:21.796
Strive for something...
a life that's worth living.

28:21.798 --> 28:25.801
People who get together
and drop their dreams and hopes,

28:25.803 --> 28:27.839
that just wasn't for me.

28:32.876 --> 28:35.145
[men shouting indistinctly]

28:44.020 --> 28:46.324
[cameraman]
Three, two, one.

28:48.057 --> 28:50.526
They told me I could not get
the great Claude Regine

28:50.528 --> 28:51.959
to do <i>Your Physique,</i>

28:51.961 --> 28:54.429
because he was under contract
with Bill Hauk.

28:54.431 --> 28:56.230
[Claude]
Well, Bill ended my contract.

28:56.232 --> 28:59.802
My doctor told me weight-lifting
is bad for me, Joe.

28:59.804 --> 29:02.270
He said I could get
athlete's heart and die from it.

29:02.272 --> 29:04.972
Your doctor says this?
Well, you can tell your doctor

29:04.974 --> 29:06.174
that Joe Weider
said "nonsense".

29:06.176 --> 29:08.075
He doesn't know
what he is talking about.

29:08.077 --> 29:10.312
[cameraman]
Three, two, one.

29:10.314 --> 29:11.546
What?

29:11.548 --> 29:13.047
Bennie, we cannot allow
these people's ignorance

29:13.049 --> 29:14.882
to make us look like
the bums. Mm-mm.

29:14.884 --> 29:16.988
It's your turn, Joe.

29:22.826 --> 29:25.427
Good. Sit still, please.

29:25.429 --> 29:28.330
Three, two...

29:28.332 --> 29:29.597
one.

29:29.599 --> 29:31.967
[camera clicks]

29:31.969 --> 29:33.267
That's the one.

29:33.269 --> 29:34.972
Of course it is.

29:42.579 --> 29:45.113
[Bill] Who the hell you think
you're posing in front of?

29:45.115 --> 29:50.017
Huh? I'm Bill Hauk,
damn it.

29:50.019 --> 29:52.453
Is there any way that you could
look intense and manly

29:52.455 --> 29:55.090
without looking like
you're taking a shit?

29:55.092 --> 29:57.092
What, did you grow
a vagina last night?

29:57.094 --> 29:59.995
I told you, you had
to man it up, intensify.

29:59.997 --> 30:02.029
Now, come on. Show it to me.

30:02.031 --> 30:03.599
Hey, Jerry.

30:03.601 --> 30:05.436
What's this?

30:11.075 --> 30:13.040
Copycats from Canada, huh?

30:13.042 --> 30:15.911
They're interested in the size
and shape of muscles.

30:15.913 --> 30:18.180
Ha! Poofters.

30:18.182 --> 30:20.615
Muscles should be useful,
not for display.

30:20.617 --> 30:24.652
This... this magazine is made
for faggots.

30:24.654 --> 30:26.520
[laughs]

30:26.522 --> 30:27.588
Come on, now.

30:27.590 --> 30:29.391
They say it's for
bodybuilders.

30:29.393 --> 30:32.960
Oh, yeah? Well, how about if
they try and build that, Jerry?

30:32.962 --> 30:34.129
Good luck, faggots!

30:34.131 --> 30:35.631
You know, I remember
this Weider kid.

30:35.633 --> 30:38.933
Little guy bought a weight set
from me on layaway

30:38.935 --> 30:40.035
when he was 13.

30:40.037 --> 30:42.103
Wrote me a dozen letters.

30:42.105 --> 30:43.572
Yeah, well, every kid
wrote to you, Jerry.

30:43.574 --> 30:45.239
- You're a legend.
- Point, taken, William.

30:45.241 --> 30:49.944
But this kid, I remember,
he was persistent.

30:49.946 --> 30:51.179
Begged me to help him.

30:51.181 --> 30:53.515
Paid me 15 cents a week,
on time.

30:53.517 --> 30:55.049
[groans]

30:55.051 --> 30:57.219
Okay, okay.
So what, Jerry?

30:57.221 --> 31:00.490
So maybe he should
be taken seriously.

31:01.557 --> 31:03.260
Uh-uh.

31:05.296 --> 31:07.062
Hey, Jerry,

31:07.064 --> 31:08.930
what kind of name
is Weider anyway?

31:08.932 --> 31:09.931
Huh?

31:09.933 --> 31:12.034
[laughs]
"Weid..."

31:12.036 --> 31:14.072
Sounds like a pig in heat.

31:15.138 --> 31:16.470
"Weider!"

31:16.472 --> 31:18.507
You know? Right?

31:18.509 --> 31:20.478
Weider, my ass.

31:25.214 --> 31:28.316
Dr. Braddock
will see you now.

31:28.318 --> 31:30.187
Sir?

31:34.357 --> 31:36.991
So, you didn't fill
out your paperwork?

31:36.993 --> 31:38.227
That's because I'm not here
as a patient.

31:38.229 --> 31:43.097
I came here to hire you as a
consultant for Weider Nutrition.

31:43.099 --> 31:45.167
And what is
Weider Nutrition?

31:45.169 --> 31:47.071
Uh, it's...

31:48.137 --> 31:50.540
Weider Nutrition.

31:56.279 --> 31:58.081
Hmm.

32:03.287 --> 32:06.153
"An open letter
from your publisher.

32:06.155 --> 32:08.190
Eating fatty foods
like french fries

32:08.192 --> 32:09.324
is bad for your heart.

32:09.326 --> 32:13.128
Sitting all day without
exercise is bad for your heart.

32:13.130 --> 32:14.595
Weight-lifting
and daily exercise

32:14.597 --> 32:17.632
is actually what your heart
needs to remain healthy.

32:17.634 --> 32:20.334
We here at Weider Publications
live by this

32:20.336 --> 32:23.138
and will challenge all those
that say building the body

32:23.140 --> 32:24.038
is bad for you.

32:24.040 --> 32:28.278
Sincerely, your publisher,
Joe Weider."

32:31.647 --> 32:33.648
Ben.

32:33.650 --> 32:36.187
Bennie.

32:40.758 --> 32:42.224
[door closes]

32:42.226 --> 32:46.193
[car engine starts]

32:46.195 --> 32:47.661
[vehicle drives away]

32:47.663 --> 32:49.264
I enlisted.

32:49.266 --> 32:50.699
I can't stand
on the sidelines any longer.

32:50.701 --> 32:54.036
Bennie, you... you know
better than anyone

32:54.038 --> 32:55.237
what's going on over there.

32:55.239 --> 32:56.638
I know, which is why
I had to enlist.

32:56.640 --> 32:59.173
I'd never be able
to forgive myself, Joe.

32:59.175 --> 33:00.609
Oh, my brother.

33:00.611 --> 33:05.212
Oh, my brother, you...
you <i>meshuggener</i> bastard.

33:05.214 --> 33:07.048
We have important
work here.

33:07.050 --> 33:09.217
No, you have
important work here.

33:09.219 --> 33:10.352
Oh, no, no.

33:10.354 --> 33:11.452
I'm coming with you.

33:11.454 --> 33:13.154
Joe, they just told me
the authorities

33:13.156 --> 33:14.756
would never allow you
to join up.

33:14.758 --> 33:15.824
What are you talking about?

33:15.826 --> 33:18.226
They want you to keep
putting out the magazines.

33:18.228 --> 33:19.393
For what?

33:19.395 --> 33:21.328
The country needs strong,
young men Joe,

33:21.330 --> 33:25.333
and you show the guys how
to get fit and ready to fight.

33:25.335 --> 33:27.201
You're training
our troops.

33:27.203 --> 33:28.636
You're already
in the fight.

33:28.638 --> 33:30.671
What if we agreed to do
instructional seminars together?

33:30.673 --> 33:35.579
You're doing your duty.
Now let me do mine, over there.

33:40.817 --> 33:42.452
Hmm.

33:44.288 --> 33:46.287
Well, look at you.

33:46.289 --> 33:48.222
All grown up, huh?

33:48.224 --> 33:50.292
I'm serious, Joe.

33:50.294 --> 33:52.296
Yeah, so am I.

33:54.464 --> 33:56.166
Come on.

34:02.338 --> 34:05.106
You... you watch your butt,
Bennie.

34:05.108 --> 34:07.209
- I will.
- If you don't come back,

34:07.211 --> 34:10.744
I'm going to have to go over
there and find you, understand?

34:10.746 --> 34:13.250
I'll be back.

34:30.733 --> 34:33.737
[traffic ambience]

[car horns honk]

34:44.748 --> 34:47.351
[indistinct chatter]

35:00.329 --> 35:02.799
Mr. Hawkins
will see you now.

35:06.235 --> 35:07.871
Have a seat.

35:08.938 --> 35:10.738
Becky, hit me.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.376
[clears throat]

35:14.210 --> 35:16.480
[lighter scratches]

35:19.215 --> 35:20.382
You Weider Publications?

35:20.384 --> 35:22.918
Yes, sir, yes.
Young, but very focused.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.552
Yeah. Becky, two Scotches.

35:24.554 --> 35:27.755
- Yes, Mr. Hawkins.
- [Hawkins] You like Scotch, Joe?

35:27.757 --> 35:29.423
I don't...
I don't drink.

35:29.425 --> 35:30.458
- It's poison.
- What's that?

35:30.460 --> 35:32.394
Don't partake,
but thank you.

35:32.396 --> 35:34.496
I am glad that you asked
to see me, though, Mr. Hawkins,

35:34.498 --> 35:37.365
because my publication
is real news, sir.

35:37.367 --> 35:39.266
And with the war on,

35:39.268 --> 35:40.936
both Canadian
and American troops

35:40.938 --> 35:44.606
are really getting
inspired by my magazine.

35:44.608 --> 35:45.407
Importance of health and fitness

35:45.409 --> 35:47.641
is critical for
their development.

35:47.643 --> 35:48.842
No longer will the benefits
of weight-lifting,

35:48.844 --> 35:51.378
bodybuilding,
nutrition for all,

35:51.380 --> 35:52.380
including women,
be overlooked.

35:52.382 --> 35:54.416
- And we want to...
- Okay, take a breath, Joe.

35:54.418 --> 35:57.519
I'm sorry, but one last thing
I do have to tell you...

35:57.521 --> 35:58.920
- Sweet Jesus, son.
- Yes.

35:58.922 --> 36:00.921
- Take a break.
- I'm sorry. Yes, sir.

36:00.923 --> 36:02.523
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

36:02.525 --> 36:05.626
Joe, you're here because
I like your magazine.

36:05.628 --> 36:07.494
I read the article
on athlete's heart.

36:07.496 --> 36:09.898
No, no, there's no such thing
as "athlete's heart".

36:09.900 --> 36:11.432
- I agree, Joe.
- Okay.

36:11.434 --> 36:13.367
And soldiers out there have been
reading it too,

36:13.369 --> 36:14.436
and it's raised morale.

36:14.438 --> 36:15.604
And that's why
I want to tell you,

36:15.606 --> 36:17.472
you found a real
distributor in us.

36:17.474 --> 36:19.307
We're the biggest
and the best, Joe.

36:19.309 --> 36:22.811
And we want to publish
your magazine.

36:22.813 --> 36:24.746
- Joe, stay with me.
- Yes, yes. Yes, sir.

36:24.748 --> 36:27.282
Yeah, yeah. We're going to take
your magazine globally.

36:27.284 --> 36:29.416
Fifty thousand copies
a month.

36:29.418 --> 36:31.418
Headquarters in New Jersey,

36:31.420 --> 36:33.021
close to our
New York office.

36:33.023 --> 36:36.992
Kid, welcome to
the big-time.

36:36.994 --> 36:38.459
- Ice!
- Um, thank...

36:38.461 --> 36:40.461
- Becky!
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.

36:40.463 --> 36:43.398
Yeah. What do you think
of the good old U.S.A.?

36:43.400 --> 36:45.032
Exciting, right?

36:45.034 --> 36:46.436
Becky!

36:47.637 --> 36:49.570
Is that a smile?
You call that a smile?

36:49.572 --> 36:52.474
- I'm not very good at it.
- You'd better get good at it,

36:52.476 --> 36:53.941
because this is just
the beginning, Joe.

36:53.943 --> 36:56.845
I've taken the liberty to
draw up a little contract here.

36:56.847 --> 36:59.481
I just need you to sign it,
and then we'll be on our way.

36:59.483 --> 37:02.653
There you go, buddy.
There you go.

37:04.820 --> 37:06.688
Well... well, this...

37:06.690 --> 37:08.523
this certainly is a dream
come true, sir,

37:08.525 --> 37:11.293
It is a dream come true.
I love making dreams come true.

37:11.295 --> 37:12.594
Sign your name on there.

37:12.596 --> 37:15.664
Yes, but I'm going to need
a $5,000 advance.

37:15.666 --> 37:18.766
And a New Jersey office
is nice,

37:18.768 --> 37:20.434
but Los Angels,
in particular, Hollywood,

37:20.436 --> 37:21.936
would be much better.

37:21.938 --> 37:24.438
I'm offering you
the whole golden calf, Joe,

37:24.440 --> 37:25.606
and you want to negotiate
with me?

37:25.608 --> 37:28.376
Well, I do have some other
projects that need funding.

37:28.378 --> 37:29.443
Weider Weights
in particular.

37:29.445 --> 37:33.014
And the physiques are just
better in Los Angeles.

37:33.016 --> 37:34.215
Better than in New Jersey?

37:34.217 --> 37:36.985
Are there better physiques
in Los Angeles than New Jersey?

37:36.987 --> 37:38.452
Of course there are.

37:38.454 --> 37:39.820
It's got movie stars
and suntanned bodies.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.889
Everything that dreams
are made of.

37:41.891 --> 37:45.562
Dreams that I can sell
better than anybody.

37:46.429 --> 37:47.998
[sighs]

37:51.467 --> 37:54.635
You sell 50,000 copies
a month for a year, Joe,

37:54.637 --> 37:57.604
and I'll build you
a headquarters on the moon.

37:57.606 --> 38:00.041
Yes, yes, I accept
that challenge.

38:00.043 --> 38:03.545
- And the $5,000?
- Yeah, that's crazy.

38:03.547 --> 38:07.014
I was thinking
more like... that.

38:07.016 --> 38:08.483
Oh, no, no.

38:08.485 --> 38:09.818
It must be 5,000.
5,000 minimum.

38:09.820 --> 38:12.454
Can I move seats,
because the sun is in my eyes.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.421
Very, very bright.

38:14.423 --> 38:16.490
Thank you. I'm sorry.

38:16.492 --> 38:17.525
You're relentless, Joe.

38:17.527 --> 38:19.829
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

38:21.530 --> 38:23.601
Checkbook!

38:33.110 --> 38:35.075
[man]
Hey, whoa!

38:35.077 --> 38:36.980
[pants]

38:51.527 --> 38:54.429
Joe, hi. Just the man
I'm looking for.

38:54.431 --> 38:57.699
Do you prefer the 3x5's
or the 5x7's of Reg Park?

38:57.701 --> 38:59.534
Oh, you know me, Kate.
The bigger the better,

38:59.536 --> 39:01.135
especially when it comes
to Reg Park.

39:01.137 --> 39:03.438
Will you be at the Regine photo
shoot later this afternoon?

39:03.440 --> 39:05.407
No. No, I'll be
at Modell's Sporting Goods

39:05.409 --> 39:06.541
in Manhattan
this afternoon.

39:06.543 --> 39:08.776
But please make sure that Claude
is in the green trunks

39:08.778 --> 39:10.912
- and have Tony shave his abs.
- You got it.

39:10.914 --> 39:12.579
Thank you.

39:12.581 --> 39:14.449
One... one second.

39:14.451 --> 39:17.552
Dolph, up.
Leg... leg up. Yeah.

39:17.554 --> 39:20.054
And better. Much better.

39:20.056 --> 39:23.425
Oh, help me out, Dolph.
Give me a flex. Give me a flex.

39:23.427 --> 39:25.659
Thank you. Good, good.

39:25.661 --> 39:27.595
Well done, Dolph.
Well done.

39:27.597 --> 39:28.563
Tony, about this afternoon...

39:28.565 --> 39:30.597
You want Regine
in the green string trunks,

39:30.599 --> 39:32.566
and you want me
to shave his abs.

39:32.568 --> 39:33.767
What are you,
a mind-reader?

39:33.769 --> 39:36.170
No, I heard you tell Kate
in the hallway.

39:36.172 --> 39:38.572
Oh, well, you have phenomenal
hearing then, very good.

39:38.574 --> 39:40.108
Very good.

39:40.110 --> 39:41.812
Acoustics echo.

39:47.583 --> 39:49.784
Wow. Weider.

39:49.786 --> 39:51.588
Yes.

39:53.088 --> 39:54.287
[Bill]
"I, Joe Weider,

39:54.289 --> 39:56.825
predict that civilization
will speed up in every phase,

39:56.827 --> 39:59.626
and that the stresses
and strains on mankind

39:59.628 --> 40:01.128
will continue to increase.

40:01.130 --> 40:02.597
Because of this,

40:02.599 --> 40:03.630
I predict that
the resulting increase

40:03.632 --> 40:05.133
in mental and physical illness

40:05.135 --> 40:07.469
will force the world
to recognize the importance

40:07.471 --> 40:11.472
of systemic exercise
and physical activities."

40:11.474 --> 40:13.608
[laughs]

40:13.610 --> 40:14.675
Fancies himself
a prophet, eh?

40:14.677 --> 40:16.110
"I predict that bodybuilding

40:16.112 --> 40:19.646
will become the chief form
of systemic exercise

40:19.648 --> 40:20.715
and physical activity.

40:20.717 --> 40:21.950
It will become a necessary
habit for all athletes

40:21.952 --> 40:26.220
who wish to keep their bodies
functioning at their best."

40:26.222 --> 40:29.958
He sure is
a lyrical fella.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.693
His magazine is filled
with this garbage.

40:31.695 --> 40:34.595
And, of course,
advertisements for his weights.

40:34.597 --> 40:36.731
And you believe that this
dirty, little Jew

40:36.733 --> 40:40.438
is selling dumbbells
and barbells now, hmm?

40:42.072 --> 40:44.738
Are you trying to be me?
Huh?

40:44.740 --> 40:46.039
He's trying to be me,

40:46.041 --> 40:48.612
and I'm not going
to tolerate it!

40:50.280 --> 40:52.450
Um...

40:53.650 --> 40:56.717
I created an illustration.

40:56.719 --> 40:57.851
It better be good.

40:57.853 --> 40:59.621
[chuckles]

40:59.623 --> 41:02.891
That's... that's youse
and that's him.

41:02.893 --> 41:05.693
[Bill]
That's me?

41:05.695 --> 41:08.795
[cackles]

41:08.797 --> 41:09.731
[laughs]

41:09.733 --> 41:12.733
All right, you put that
in the next issue.

41:12.735 --> 41:13.934
Okay? You know what?

41:13.936 --> 41:15.936
You put it in every issue.

41:15.938 --> 41:17.539
Okay?

41:17.541 --> 41:18.805
Ma'am, ma'am?

41:18.807 --> 41:20.708
Weider Weights
are on special today.

41:20.710 --> 41:23.811
Take a look at this
"before and after".

41:23.813 --> 41:24.945
Remarkable.

41:24.947 --> 41:26.581
What's the secret?

41:26.583 --> 41:27.949
Just what he's doing here.
Repetition.

41:27.951 --> 41:29.684
That is all.
Anyone can do it.

41:29.686 --> 41:31.586
Weider Weights come
with a set of instructions

41:31.588 --> 41:34.155
and a list of 10
of my favorite exercises.

41:34.157 --> 41:36.990
These exercises will tone
and shape your body,

41:36.992 --> 41:38.626
which will in turn
free your spirit,

41:38.628 --> 41:40.193
which will in turn
free your mind

41:40.195 --> 41:43.130
and give you
a new passion for life.

41:43.132 --> 41:45.766
Oh. It will do all that,
will it?

41:45.768 --> 41:46.800
Mm-hmm.

41:46.802 --> 41:47.869
Con man.

41:47.871 --> 41:50.304
What? Con man?
No, no.

41:50.306 --> 41:53.009
I see you still have
the touch.

41:53.876 --> 41:55.677
Bennie.

41:55.679 --> 41:56.811
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie.

41:56.813 --> 41:58.947
- [grunts]
- Ah, put me down.

41:58.949 --> 42:02.686
- Good to see you.
- Got a gift for you, from Egypt.

42:03.987 --> 42:05.753
- It's a hat.
- Yeah.

42:05.755 --> 42:07.688
- It's a nice hat.
- It's yours.

42:07.690 --> 42:10.758
I went by your fancy
new offices.

42:10.760 --> 42:12.760
They said you were here.

42:12.762 --> 42:16.898
Regine was doing
a shoot in a G-string.

42:16.900 --> 42:18.733
I have to say,
his abs looked amazing.

42:18.735 --> 42:19.900
What are you doing
to these guys?

42:19.902 --> 42:22.202
Our new offices, Bennie.
Our.

42:22.204 --> 42:24.005
And we now have
so many new techniques

42:24.007 --> 42:26.074
for training every muscle
in the body.

42:26.076 --> 42:29.242
We've made training a system,
a science.

42:29.244 --> 42:32.713
And it never hurts to show
as much muscle as possible.

42:32.715 --> 42:34.782
We have female readers,

42:34.784 --> 42:35.650
as well as certain males
who appreciate

42:35.652 --> 42:39.086
the more revealing
photographic arts.

42:39.088 --> 42:40.621
Fans are fans.

42:40.623 --> 42:43.124
Joe, how'd you get these
manufactured so quickly?

42:43.126 --> 42:45.892
Well, I used the advance we got
from American News Company,

42:45.894 --> 42:47.862
as well as an additional
few thousand

42:47.864 --> 42:49.764
from our <i>Physique</i> salary.

42:49.766 --> 42:52.633
Oh. And are we selling
a lot of them?

42:52.635 --> 42:54.702
No. Not yet.

42:54.704 --> 42:56.804
But we will.

42:56.806 --> 42:58.673
[Ben] Yeah, well,
it's too much too fast.

42:58.675 --> 43:00.874
You're sinking every dime
into other Weider enterprises.

43:00.876 --> 43:03.344
Some is money
we haven't even made yet.

43:03.346 --> 43:04.845
And tell me, exactly,

43:04.847 --> 43:07.081
what are these other
enterprises?

43:07.083 --> 43:09.316
Well, we're publishing
another magazine.

43:09.318 --> 43:11.318
Dr. Braddock and I have been
working on some formulas

43:11.320 --> 43:14.822
for vitamins, anti-aging pills,
protein powders.

43:14.824 --> 43:16.057
Oh, and the gym equipment,
Bennie.

43:16.059 --> 43:17.891
The gym equipment,
because someday, you know,

43:17.893 --> 43:19.159
we're going to open
our own gym.

43:19.161 --> 43:20.795
Joe, how are we going
to do all this?

43:20.797 --> 43:22.362
That's going to spread us
way too thin.

43:22.364 --> 43:24.831
Bennie, no, we have more
than 50,000 readers every month,

43:24.833 --> 43:26.200
and all of our advertising
is free.

43:26.202 --> 43:28.403
Come on, look.
All free, huh?

43:28.405 --> 43:32.206
Yeah, 50,000 readers,
with nothing in reserve. Why?

43:32.208 --> 43:34.374
Because you're throwing our
profits right back out there.

43:34.376 --> 43:37.077
What if one of these
other enterprises

43:37.079 --> 43:40.947
needs more time or, in fact,
simply fails?

43:40.949 --> 43:43.885
We'll go under.
It's basic economics.

43:43.887 --> 43:45.253
Joe, are you
listening to me,

43:45.255 --> 43:47.854
or has Betty the pin-up's gaze
put a spell on you?

43:47.856 --> 43:49.090
Of course.
Of course, I'm listening.

43:49.092 --> 43:50.825
You, suddenly you're
a financial wizard, huh?

43:50.827 --> 43:52.226
I studied whilst
I was away, Joe.

43:52.228 --> 43:54.061
If you insist on expanding
this aggressively,

43:54.063 --> 43:56.930
then we're going to leave
ourselves exposed.

43:56.932 --> 43:59.833
Nonsense. Nonsense, no.
Strike while the iron is hot.

43:59.835 --> 44:02.336
That's what we'll do.

44:02.338 --> 44:03.336
[knocking]

44:03.338 --> 44:05.840
- Joe.
- [Joe] Mm, what?

44:05.842 --> 44:08.846
You're going to want
to see this.

44:18.320 --> 44:19.954
Bastard.

44:19.956 --> 44:21.289
He writes a lot of trash
about you in this issue.

44:21.291 --> 44:23.356
- You know he's a Nazi.
- That's not proven, Joe.

44:23.358 --> 44:25.760
- You can't write it.
- No, that bastard

44:25.762 --> 44:26.827
is a renowned anti-Semite.

44:26.829 --> 44:29.896
Ask Claude, Reg, Jack LaLanne.
They all know it.

44:29.898 --> 44:31.032
You can't print it, Joe.

44:31.034 --> 44:32.967
Now I'm forced to use
valuable space in our magazine

44:32.969 --> 44:35.970
to defend against his lies,
space that could be used

44:35.972 --> 44:37.037
for constructive
weight-training advice.

44:37.039 --> 44:39.941
What, does he not care
about health and fitness?

44:39.943 --> 44:41.909
He cares about his power
and money, Joe.

44:41.911 --> 44:44.479
He sees us infringing
on his empire and he's worried.

44:44.481 --> 44:46.481
He knows the Weider methods
work better,

44:46.483 --> 44:49.050
so he tries to pull us down
any way he can.

44:49.052 --> 44:52.753
We will show him just how well
our methods work.

44:52.755 --> 44:56.025
Our bodybuilders will crush his
at Mr. Universe.

44:57.260 --> 44:58.896
Trash.

45:00.396 --> 45:01.595
I need to walk.

45:01.597 --> 45:04.065
[announcer] <i>Here we are,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

45:04.067 --> 45:07.834
<i>The candidates
for Mr. Universe.</i>

45:07.836 --> 45:09.972
[applause]

45:30.326 --> 45:31.425
Mr. Weider,

45:31.427 --> 45:33.528
may I have a word
with you, please?

45:33.530 --> 45:35.061
What, now? No, no.

45:35.063 --> 45:35.996
We are watching
this incredible show.

45:35.998 --> 45:37.967
Come on,
you should join us.

45:41.070 --> 45:43.436
A chief representative
of the Amateur Athletic Union,

45:43.438 --> 45:45.873
I am afraid I am forced
to disqualify

45:45.875 --> 45:48.208
your contestants
from any weight-lifting

45:48.210 --> 45:50.378
and bodybuilding events
in the United States,

45:50.380 --> 45:51.878
unless you withdraw.

45:51.880 --> 45:53.079
Now, if you would please
leave the stage.

45:53.081 --> 45:56.016
- On what grounds?
- What are you people trying to pull?

45:56.018 --> 45:57.552
Your sanction
will be withdrawn.

45:57.554 --> 46:00.121
- Under whose authority?
- The AAU Weightlifting Committee

46:00.123 --> 46:01.988
in the United States,
from the highest level.

46:01.990 --> 46:03.925
Look, these men
work for you.

46:03.927 --> 46:05.092
They're paid
by your magazine.

46:05.094 --> 46:07.094
Therefore,
they are not amateurs.

46:07.096 --> 46:09.130
No, no, they are paid
as fitness models

46:09.132 --> 46:09.930
and experts on training.

46:09.932 --> 46:12.133
The AAU controls
all amateur sports

46:12.135 --> 46:13.934
in North America,
Mr. Weider.

46:13.936 --> 46:15.836
So, if you'd like to participate
in a sporting event,

46:15.838 --> 46:18.005
I suggest you adhere
to our rules and regulations.

46:18.007 --> 46:21.041
You, you're a hypocrite
and a liar.

46:21.043 --> 46:22.142
You gave us a sanction,

46:22.144 --> 46:23.878
and now you let Hauk
take it away.

46:23.880 --> 46:25.213
Look, there's no
going around us.

46:25.215 --> 46:27.315
Either you work with us
or there's nothing.

46:27.317 --> 46:30.550
Well, what if our contestants
denounce the AAU completely?

46:30.552 --> 46:32.153
Then you would never
be able to compete

46:32.155 --> 46:33.887
in one of our competitions
ever again.

46:33.889 --> 46:37.490
But they would be allowed
to compete in their own.

46:37.492 --> 46:39.392
I implore you gentlemen,
don't listen to the Weiders.

46:39.394 --> 46:41.461
They do not have your best
interest in mind.

46:41.463 --> 46:44.130
You are the one trying to take
away what is rightfully theirs.

46:44.132 --> 46:45.999
They do not need the AAU.

46:46.001 --> 46:47.367
- You... you screw them anyway.
- Yeah.

46:47.369 --> 46:50.470
You take this away and you'll
find yourself in court.

46:50.472 --> 46:52.440
- We don't need the AAU.
- [Joe] These men will agree

46:52.442 --> 46:54.374
to never participate in another
AAU-sanctioned event.

46:54.376 --> 46:56.978
That what you want?
From now on, they will compete

46:56.980 --> 47:00.014
only in...
IFBB-sanctioned events,

47:00.016 --> 47:01.648
and that will be
the end of this.

47:01.650 --> 47:03.117
What the hell is the IFBB?

47:03.119 --> 47:05.119
International Federation
of Bodybuilders.

47:05.121 --> 47:07.121
I've never heard of any IFBB.
Are you nuts?

47:07.123 --> 47:09.423
Are you?
Because the IFBB not only has

47:09.425 --> 47:11.525
the best bodybuilders in
the world, these men right here,

47:11.527 --> 47:13.927
but we will attract
every man worth his salt,

47:13.929 --> 47:17.197
Because what you and Bill Hauk
do not realize is...

47:17.199 --> 47:22.036
all these men want is to compete
against the very best.

47:22.038 --> 47:24.137
- Damn right.
- [Joe] We are here.

47:24.139 --> 47:25.173
They are here.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.909
The champion bodybuilders
people came to see.

47:27.911 --> 47:30.945
We are the IFBB.

47:30.947 --> 47:32.146
We came to compete, Harry.

47:32.148 --> 47:36.186
You take this away,
I'll make you regret it.

47:39.322 --> 47:40.153
Fine.

47:40.155 --> 47:42.123
Fine, this competition
will go on.

47:42.125 --> 47:46.059
We will discuss rules
and regulations with you...

47:46.061 --> 47:48.929
with the IFBB,
at a later time.

47:48.931 --> 47:50.500
Good luck.

47:52.235 --> 47:55.436
[audience applauding]

47:55.438 --> 47:58.606
I wonder when he'll figure out
there is no organization

47:58.608 --> 48:00.206
called the IFBB.

48:00.208 --> 48:02.543
He won't.
We just created it.

48:02.545 --> 48:04.979
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

48:04.981 --> 48:06.981
the winner of Mr. Universe...

48:06.983 --> 48:08.548
Reg Park!

48:08.550 --> 48:10.583
[audience cheers]

48:10.585 --> 48:12.555
Let's hear it for Reg.

48:18.994 --> 48:20.695
Oh!

48:20.697 --> 48:23.563
- Congratulations, Mr. Weider.
- Thank you.

48:23.565 --> 48:25.666
- It's all thanks to you, Joe.
- We're going to up your protein.

48:25.668 --> 48:28.436
- 200 grams a day.
- Do you ever stop?

48:28.438 --> 48:29.104
No, I do not.

48:29.106 --> 48:31.104
- Well done.
- Gravy, Joe.

48:31.106 --> 48:32.273
Well done.

48:32.275 --> 48:34.342
Hey, you know what
your problem is?

48:34.344 --> 48:35.242
Hmm?

48:35.244 --> 48:39.181
You think that what you do
is a sport.

48:40.048 --> 48:41.282
You know what I think?

48:41.284 --> 48:45.251
No, and I do not care.

48:45.253 --> 48:47.220
Because I don't think
that you think, Bill.

48:47.222 --> 48:50.691
Your mind is like your magazine:
fixed in cement.

48:50.693 --> 48:53.130
[laughs]

48:55.231 --> 48:57.234
That was a good one.

48:59.101 --> 49:01.437
Okay, well, congrats.

49:04.007 --> 49:06.106
[both grunt]

49:06.108 --> 49:08.075
I create impeccable men.

49:08.077 --> 49:09.443
I teach greatness.

49:09.445 --> 49:13.179
You... you just got lucky today,
didn't you?

49:13.181 --> 49:15.217
[grunts]

49:17.152 --> 49:18.318
What the hell
is going on here?

49:18.320 --> 49:21.488
Oh, it seems your brother
just had a little accident.

49:21.490 --> 49:24.124
I think you should
probably tell him

49:24.126 --> 49:26.159
that it's time
to settle down.

49:26.161 --> 49:28.162
- [grunts]
- Joe! Joe!

49:28.164 --> 49:29.796
We've already beaten
this bum.

49:29.798 --> 49:34.168
Let's not snatch defeat
from the jaws of victory, huh?

49:34.170 --> 49:36.269
[groaning]

49:36.271 --> 49:38.338
- [Ben] Come on.
- [Joe] I need a doctor.

They don't cover themselves up
in sweaters and coats.

They don't have to.

50:11.373 --> 50:13.173
Well, I'm told
the California crowd,

50:13.175 --> 50:15.242
they don't welcome
outsiders.

I'm sorry, Mr. Weider,

50:34.563 --> 50:37.498
but I'm just
completely lost here.

50:37.500 --> 50:40.233
You and your partner,
Mr. Nasium,

50:40.235 --> 50:42.369
will have to educate me.

50:42.371 --> 50:45.206
Mr. Nasium?
Who... who is Mr. Nasium?

50:45.208 --> 50:47.240
That's what I want to know,
and why hasn't he joined us?

50:47.242 --> 50:49.342
There is no Mr. Nasium.

50:49.344 --> 50:51.612
- You said Mr. Nasium.
- No, no, I did not.

50:51.614 --> 50:54.248
Mr. Weider,
you mentioned a "Jim Nasium"

50:54.250 --> 50:56.150
several times on the phone.

50:56.152 --> 50:59.253
Jim Nas...

50:59.255 --> 51:01.322
Gymnasium.
Gymnasium is not the person.

51:01.324 --> 51:03.324
- It's a place.
- It's a place?

51:03.326 --> 51:05.226
The place of business
we were talking about?

51:05.228 --> 51:06.526
- Ah, I see.
- Yes. "Gym" for short.

51:06.528 --> 51:10.396
Well, these "gyms" are not
what we invest in.

51:10.398 --> 51:13.266
Well, Mr. Hochberg,
I'd be happy to show you one.

51:13.268 --> 51:15.436
In fact, if you
approve this loan,

51:15.438 --> 51:17.371
we will train you
for free.

51:17.373 --> 51:20.307
- We could change your life.
- I don't want my life changed.

51:20.309 --> 51:21.407
I like my life.

51:21.409 --> 51:24.278
What goes on
in these gymnasiums?

51:24.280 --> 51:26.646
Exercise, Mr. Hochberg.
Exercise.

51:26.648 --> 51:29.150
What are people paying for
then, exactly?

51:29.152 --> 51:31.151
Have you heard
of weight-lifting,

51:31.153 --> 51:35.222
jumping rope, barbells?

51:35.224 --> 51:36.856
Why would anyone...

51:36.858 --> 51:38.425
a normal person...

51:38.427 --> 51:40.293
pay to go to a strange place
like that?

51:40.295 --> 51:43.296
To look good
and to feel good.

51:43.298 --> 51:44.498
[laughs]

51:44.500 --> 51:46.266
[coughs]

51:46.268 --> 51:47.867
You think real people,

51:47.869 --> 51:49.436
grownups,

51:49.438 --> 51:51.371
will pay good money
to go to a place

51:51.373 --> 51:53.606
to pick up weights
and sweat together?

51:53.608 --> 51:55.842
And open themselves up
to athlete's heart

51:55.844 --> 51:57.478
- and heart attacks.
- Mr. Hochberg,

51:57.480 --> 51:59.345
athlete's heart
is not real.

51:59.347 --> 52:00.813
As you strengthen
your muscles,

52:00.815 --> 52:03.284
you also strengthen the most
important muscle of your body:

52:03.286 --> 52:04.385
the heart.

52:04.387 --> 52:06.186
It brings more oxygen
to the blood,

52:06.188 --> 52:07.287
which goes to your brain.

52:07.289 --> 52:08.722
Allows them to think
more clearly.

52:08.724 --> 52:10.191
Gyms are the future.

52:10.193 --> 52:11.358
They're good for people.

52:11.360 --> 52:13.793
They're good for the body
for the mind and the spirit.

52:13.795 --> 52:16.329
People, if they choose
to exercise,

52:16.331 --> 52:18.465
can play sports, box, row.

52:18.467 --> 52:20.568
Any number of vigorous
activities.

52:20.570 --> 52:24.470
One thing they do not need
is a public sweathouse

52:24.472 --> 52:26.240
with heavy weights in it.

52:26.242 --> 52:27.441
No, but... but... but...

52:27.443 --> 52:29.742
but this is Hollywood.

52:29.744 --> 52:30.844
Yes, it is.

52:30.846 --> 52:35.583
You can always take your ideas
back up to New York.

52:35.585 --> 52:39.353
Evidently, up there,
the banks are run by lunatics,

52:39.355 --> 52:41.925
if they would fund an idea
like this.

52:49.231 --> 52:51.467
[Joe]
Those are bad for you.

53:04.547 --> 53:07.416
[man]
I got this. I got it.

53:14.289 --> 53:15.521
Joe Weider.

53:15.523 --> 53:16.956
Thanks for making trek in,
buddy.

53:16.958 --> 53:18.758
Jack, it's good to see you.
Good to see you.

53:18.760 --> 53:21.494
My God, what an oasis
you have here, huh?

53:21.496 --> 53:22.996
- Oh, yeah.
- Is it always busy like this?

53:22.998 --> 53:26.333
It just keeps getting bigger
and bigger, thanks to you.

53:26.335 --> 53:27.967
I cannot believe
you're here.

53:27.969 --> 53:30.970
Thank you for all this.
It's all because of you.

53:30.972 --> 53:32.572
- Mm-hmm.
- Can you believe

53:32.574 --> 53:34.677
that people still don't
even know what a gym is?

53:36.445 --> 53:37.677
Hey, guys, look who it is.

53:37.679 --> 53:39.512
It's the one and only
Joe Weider.

53:39.514 --> 53:41.981
Joe Weider,
the real deal.

53:41.983 --> 53:43.816
- It is so great to meet you.
- Yes, yes. You know,

53:43.818 --> 53:45.952
sometime I'd like
to do a story on you guys,

53:45.954 --> 53:47.621
on the streamlined
West Coast physique.

53:47.623 --> 53:50.356
- That would be out of sight.
- Keep up the good work.

53:50.358 --> 53:52.525
Good job, guys.

53:52.527 --> 53:53.693
Jack, how in the world
did you get a bank

53:53.695 --> 53:55.461
to help you buy
all this equipment?

53:55.463 --> 53:57.930
I didn't. There's no way
they would lend me the money.

53:57.932 --> 53:59.566
They all think
we're loonies.

53:59.568 --> 54:01.367
You know, I learned that
the hard way.

54:01.369 --> 54:02.635
Come on, why are you
even thinking

54:02.637 --> 54:05.438
about building another gym
in the first place?

54:05.440 --> 54:06.539
And don't be so hasty.

54:06.541 --> 54:10.911
I'm your friend.
I'm not Bill Hauk.

54:10.913 --> 54:11.878
I have all of your work.

54:11.880 --> 54:13.746
I have your weights.
I have your magazines.

54:13.748 --> 54:16.852
You have too much
on your plate.

54:19.322 --> 54:20.920
Oh, my.

54:20.922 --> 54:24.391
Oh, you didn't hear a single
word that I just said, did you?

54:24.393 --> 54:27.061
Jack, is that
who I think it is?

54:27.063 --> 54:30.731
Well, if you think
that's Betty Brosmer, then yeah.

54:30.733 --> 54:33.032
She is so much more
beautiful in person, Jack.

54:33.034 --> 54:35.068
You have to introduce me.

54:35.070 --> 54:36.137
[laughs]

54:36.139 --> 54:39.340
Come on, why would I introduce
a palooka like you

54:39.342 --> 54:41.641
to the most beautiful woman
in the entire world?

54:41.643 --> 54:43.677
- It doesn't make any sense.
- I see your point.

54:43.679 --> 54:47.550
I see your point, but please.
Anything... anything helpful.

54:48.717 --> 54:51.617
Okay, well, don't open
a gym here then.

54:51.619 --> 54:54.454
- What?
- If you don't start a gym,

54:54.456 --> 54:56.759
then I'll introduce you
to her.

55:00.528 --> 55:02.729
Fine. Fine, yes. Deal.

55:02.731 --> 55:06.099
But when you introduce us,
you tell her I'm your mentor.

55:06.101 --> 55:07.367
[laughs]

55:07.369 --> 55:08.501
- My mentor?
- Mm-hmm.

55:08.503 --> 55:10.970
You're a publisher
from New York.

55:10.972 --> 55:13.407
Isn't that good enough?

55:13.409 --> 55:15.809
You're right, a simple
introduction will be fine.

55:15.811 --> 55:18.479
- [camera snaps]
- [cameraman] Okay.

55:18.481 --> 55:20.850
How about a little
more shoulder?

55:22.485 --> 55:25.088
- [camera snaps]
- Even more playful.

55:27.389 --> 55:29.523
- [camera snaps]
- Perfect.

55:29.525 --> 55:31.628
Take a break, doll.

55:33.596 --> 55:36.829
- Hi, Betty.
- Lonnie, what a nice surprise.

55:36.831 --> 55:40.666
Yes, I came down with a magazine
publisher, Joe Weider,

55:40.668 --> 55:42.702
who wants you
for a photo shoot.

55:42.704 --> 55:44.604
Weider. Weider.
That name sounds familiar.

55:44.606 --> 55:47.007
You met him a few months back
with Jack LaLanne.

55:47.009 --> 55:51.681
He's got those muscle and
exercise magazines and pulps.

55:53.516 --> 55:57.184
Of course. I remember you.
Jack LaLanne's friend.

55:57.186 --> 55:59.052
Yes, yes, we met at the gym.

55:59.054 --> 56:02.722
I remember you mentioning your
fondness for philosophy and art.

56:02.724 --> 56:04.191
You have an excellent memory,
Joe.

56:04.193 --> 56:06.559
And you also said you love
<i>A Farewell to Arms</i>

56:06.561 --> 56:08.595
and Fats Waller's piano.

56:08.597 --> 56:11.601
Yes. I certainly do.

56:13.101 --> 56:15.568
Joe, about the photo shoot
you'd like Betty to do.

56:15.570 --> 56:17.771
Oh, yeah, no,
not "like". Need.

56:17.773 --> 56:20.206
I need Betty for the cover
of my newest magazine,

56:20.208 --> 56:21.708
<i>American Manhood.</i>

56:21.710 --> 56:22.909
- [laughs]
- Look at that smile. Incredible.

56:22.911 --> 56:26.146
Betty, you will make my magazine
fly right off the stands,

56:26.148 --> 56:27.713
all over the world.

56:27.715 --> 56:29.182
You put women on the cover
of your muscle magazines?

56:29.184 --> 56:31.552
Well... Well, we do as of now,
Miss Brosmer, yes.

56:31.554 --> 56:34.521
I'd like to put you on the cover
with the great Earl Clark.

56:34.523 --> 56:36.557
Who's Earl Clark?

56:36.559 --> 56:37.691
He is Mr. Universe.

56:37.693 --> 56:40.193
Would you prefer
Reg Park?

56:40.195 --> 56:41.695
Who's Reg Park?

56:41.697 --> 56:44.164
Reg Park?
Well, he is also Mr. Universe.

56:44.166 --> 56:48.068
I'm sorry, I don't follow your
muscle competitions so closely.

56:48.070 --> 56:53.606
What about a cover
with Tony Curtis?

56:53.608 --> 56:55.608
- Who is Tony Curtis?
- [laughs]

56:55.610 --> 56:57.610
Well, he's an actor,
Mr. Weider.

56:57.612 --> 56:59.912
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

56:59.914 --> 57:01.849
A woman like you
has too fine a physique

57:01.851 --> 57:03.650
to share the cover
with an actor.

57:03.652 --> 57:06.787
All those guys are either
too scrawny or too flabby.

57:06.789 --> 57:08.188
And you would only
make them look worse.

57:08.190 --> 57:11.724
No, you need to be on the cover
with a real bodybuilder.

57:11.726 --> 57:12.860
[Lonnie]
Betty's time is not cheap, Joe.

57:12.862 --> 57:15.965
I'll pay her 15% more
than she is being paid today.

57:17.599 --> 57:19.166
Why, thank you.

57:19.168 --> 57:22.568
I look forward to working
with whomever you decide.

57:22.570 --> 57:24.973
Great.

57:34.682 --> 57:35.715
[camera snaps]

57:35.717 --> 57:38.651
- [cameraman] Good.
- Can I get more oil, please?

57:38.653 --> 57:41.822
Just a little bit more
right here.

57:41.824 --> 57:44.092
And for Betty too.
Betty too.

57:47.228 --> 57:48.795
And... wait, hold on.

57:48.797 --> 57:51.298
Everything...
everything's smooth.

57:51.300 --> 57:52.699
Perfect. No streaks.

57:52.701 --> 57:54.568
No streaks.
There we go.

57:54.570 --> 57:56.168
- Very nice.
- Good? Great.

57:56.170 --> 57:59.171
Maybe a leg up.
A little sexy. Yes.

57:59.173 --> 58:01.240
[camera snaps]

58:01.242 --> 58:02.642
And, why not?

58:02.644 --> 58:04.947
- There we go.
- [laughs]

58:06.181 --> 58:07.680
[camera snaps]

58:07.682 --> 58:08.682
Can we dance?
Would you like to dance?

58:08.684 --> 58:10.684
- [laughs]
- You want to dance?

58:10.686 --> 58:12.655
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

58:13.722 --> 58:15.725
[clears throat]

58:17.559 --> 58:19.659
[camera snaps]

58:19.661 --> 58:21.161
I'd like a break.
A little break.

58:21.163 --> 58:23.630
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.

58:23.632 --> 58:24.597
- You look beautiful.
- Are you happy?

58:24.599 --> 58:26.766
Very nice. Love it.
The outfit is gorgeous.

58:26.768 --> 58:28.735
With your eyes, the hair,
everything.

58:28.737 --> 58:30.670
- Perfect.
- Wonderful.

58:30.672 --> 58:32.773
Perfect. Let's take a walk.
You want to take a walk?

58:32.775 --> 58:35.878
- Sure. Yeah.
- Let's take a walk. Come on.

58:58.701 --> 59:00.766
Say, fella...

59:00.768 --> 59:03.269
- you mind standing up?
- What?

59:03.271 --> 59:04.838
Your transverse abdominus.

59:04.840 --> 59:06.807
- Beautiful stuff.
- What?

59:06.809 --> 59:08.809
A sculptor couldn't make
a more defined V-cut.

59:08.811 --> 59:10.811
- [man] Whoa, hey, I'm not queer.
- [Joe] No, neither am I.

59:10.813 --> 59:13.780
It's my business.
How hard are your abdominals?

59:13.782 --> 59:14.581
I don't know what that is.

59:14.583 --> 59:16.782
Your stomach muscles.
The bumps.

59:16.784 --> 59:19.686
I guess they're pretty hard.

59:19.688 --> 59:23.757
You mind flexing
your lowers?

59:23.759 --> 59:24.925
I don't really like this.

59:24.927 --> 59:26.193
I'm a publisher
for a muscle magazine.

59:26.195 --> 59:28.965
Please, I just want to see.
Please.

59:31.666 --> 59:32.865
Wow. Bravo.

59:32.867 --> 59:34.101
Really, really nice.

59:34.103 --> 59:36.802
Nice work. How do you suppose
you got those?

59:36.804 --> 59:39.373
- Surfing, I guess.
- Uh-huh.

59:39.375 --> 59:41.775
Would you mind?
I'd like to see that.

59:41.777 --> 59:43.043
Would you mind?
Would you show me?

59:43.045 --> 59:46.278
- In the sand right here?
- Yeah. That's fine.

59:46.280 --> 59:48.851
Just take it slow.

59:54.989 --> 59:56.625
Huh.

01:00:00.695 --> 01:00:03.231
Come here. Come on.

01:00:23.751 --> 01:00:27.253
- Hey! What?
- [laughs]

01:00:27.255 --> 01:00:28.789
Oh, really?

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:29.889
Really?
Think that's funny?

01:00:29.891 --> 01:00:31.994
- [laughing]
- Is that funny?

01:00:34.963 --> 01:00:37.834
Try that one next, okay?

01:00:40.436 --> 01:00:42.769
- [laughs]
- We're fine, we're fine.

01:00:42.771 --> 01:00:44.704
All right.

01:00:44.706 --> 01:00:47.109
Are we fine?
Here we go.

01:00:57.885 --> 01:01:00.956
[Betty squeals excitedly]

01:01:20.876 --> 01:01:22.412
[soft panting]

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:28.351
[sighs]

01:01:29.418 --> 01:01:30.916
How do you feel about

01:01:30.918 --> 01:01:35.387
doing a risqué cover
with Leroy Colbert?

01:01:35.389 --> 01:01:37.824
Who is Leroy Colbert?

01:01:37.826 --> 01:01:39.959
He's the next
Mr. Universe.

01:01:39.961 --> 01:01:43.963
He's the only man in the world
with 21-inch arms.

01:01:43.965 --> 01:01:46.999
And he's a colored guy.

01:01:47.001 --> 01:01:50.003
Why does that matter?

01:01:50.005 --> 01:01:52.438
That he's got
21-inch arms?

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.074
That he's a colored guy.

01:01:54.076 --> 01:01:57.276
Oh, well, there's never been
a colored bodybuilder

01:01:57.278 --> 01:02:01.014
on the cover of
a muscle magazine before.

01:02:01.016 --> 01:02:02.481
We would be the first.

01:02:02.483 --> 01:02:07.920
And I want you to hang
from one of those massive biceps

01:02:07.922 --> 01:02:10.058
right on the cover.

01:02:12.027 --> 01:02:15.228
Well, if the point of it
is to be the first

01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:19.132
to show a colored man's muscular
body on the cover of a magazine,

01:02:19.134 --> 01:02:21.200
well, then,
let that be the point.

01:02:21.202 --> 01:02:25.307
It seems to me that I would
only undermine that, Joe.

01:02:30.112 --> 01:02:34.414
Well, I have to say
that you are 100% right.

01:02:34.416 --> 01:02:35.981
And I was wrong.

01:02:35.983 --> 01:02:40.019
You don't hear that often,
I know.

01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:42.424
- What? What?
- [laughs]

01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:46.059
Did you just say
that I was right?

01:02:46.061 --> 01:02:48.327
Mm-hmm. Maybe.

01:02:48.329 --> 01:02:50.266
I might have.

01:02:52.434 --> 01:02:56.072
Can we talk
about something else?

01:02:58.005 --> 01:03:00.440
Like what?

01:03:00.442 --> 01:03:02.976
Anything.

01:03:02.978 --> 01:03:05.047
Anything else.

01:03:07.949 --> 01:03:10.349
All right.

01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:13.119
Let's talk about
our lovemaking then.

01:03:13.121 --> 01:03:19.262
You have such
precise movements.

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:21.994
Perfectly timed.

01:03:21.996 --> 01:03:25.100
Powerful hip thrusts.

01:03:26.268 --> 01:03:29.369
It's got to be
the glute raises.

01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:32.037
And we should really do a piece
on that for women,

01:03:32.039 --> 01:03:35.443
because our readers
would definitely benefit.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.380
You're so stupid, Joe.

01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:42.414
What?

01:03:42.416 --> 01:03:44.150
- You don't have a clue.
- What?

01:03:44.152 --> 01:03:46.119
- Where are you going?
- Home.

01:03:46.121 --> 01:03:48.021
- No, you can't go.
- Why can't I go?

01:03:48.023 --> 01:03:49.923
Well, because you don't
have your car,

01:03:49.925 --> 01:03:51.891
and because I need you.

01:03:51.893 --> 01:03:54.260
I don't think you need me, Joe.
You need subjects

01:03:54.262 --> 01:03:55.628
for your readers to admire
and learn from.

01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:58.231
Well, then you are the one
who is clueless.

01:03:58.233 --> 01:04:00.032
- You have no idea.
- I don't.

01:04:00.034 --> 01:04:02.501
Because you don't share
anything about you,

01:04:02.503 --> 01:04:03.936
about your family,

01:04:03.938 --> 01:04:05.237
about Canada,
what you really feel.

01:04:05.239 --> 01:04:08.041
I don't like to talk
about my childhood, Betty.

01:04:08.043 --> 01:04:10.276
- You know that.
- Give me something.

01:04:10.278 --> 01:04:11.411
Anything.

01:04:11.413 --> 01:04:14.914
What?

01:04:14.916 --> 01:04:16.249
What is your happiest
memory?

01:04:16.251 --> 01:04:21.153
Tell me you happiest memory
of you growing up.

01:04:21.155 --> 01:04:22.923
My happiest memory?
Why? For what?

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:25.561
Because I want to know.

01:04:29.965 --> 01:04:35.034
I am not just a thing
or a shape

01:04:35.036 --> 01:04:37.070
that you can just have.

01:04:37.072 --> 01:04:39.305
I don't even know
what that means.

01:04:39.307 --> 01:04:42.175
I'm right here.
I just want you to talk to me.

01:04:42.177 --> 01:04:44.276
I need to know
who you really are, Joe.

01:04:44.278 --> 01:04:47.479
Who am I? I'm just...
I'm me, I'm Joe.

01:04:47.481 --> 01:04:49.983
- The guy who's crazy about you.
- Give me something!

01:04:49.985 --> 01:04:52.021
Something! Anything!

01:04:53.088 --> 01:04:54.220
[sighs]

01:04:54.222 --> 01:04:56.222
Your first day of school.

01:04:56.224 --> 01:04:57.990
That was a happy memory,
right?

01:04:57.992 --> 01:04:59.025
No.

01:04:59.027 --> 01:05:00.726
Where did you sit?

01:05:00.728 --> 01:05:02.195
Was there a window?

01:05:02.197 --> 01:05:05.097
Did you look outside?
What did you see?

01:05:05.099 --> 01:05:07.032
I... I don't know.

01:05:07.034 --> 01:05:08.367
I don't know. I...

01:05:08.369 --> 01:05:10.269
Maybe there's something
wrong with me.

01:05:10.271 --> 01:05:12.271
I... I can't remember
anything

01:05:12.273 --> 01:05:15.310
before I started writing
for the magazine.

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:22.685
Okay.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.123
Okay.

01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:30.425
I'll start.

01:05:32.126 --> 01:05:36.262
I had an aunt
in San Francisco

01:05:36.264 --> 01:05:41.166
who collected
these antiques.

01:05:41.168 --> 01:05:44.204
China, glass and wood.

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:47.139
And she would display
her favorites,

01:05:47.141 --> 01:05:51.478
just so,
behind glass.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.447
Once, when I was a little girl,
I stayed with her.

01:05:54.449 --> 01:05:59.151
And she saw me staring
at these beautiful,

01:05:59.153 --> 01:06:02.789
beautiful glass figurines.

01:06:02.791 --> 01:06:05.224
My aunt,
she opened the glass

01:06:05.226 --> 01:06:10.162
and she let me hold
my favorites.

01:06:10.164 --> 01:06:12.264
I felt this power,

01:06:12.266 --> 01:06:15.200
like I had never
felt before.

01:06:15.202 --> 01:06:18.170
Like I had held something
truly important

01:06:18.172 --> 01:06:21.176
for the very first time.

01:06:24.278 --> 01:06:26.614
That's a happy memory, Joe.

01:06:31.219 --> 01:06:33.787
Yeah, no, I...

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:36.088
I... I don't...

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:38.193
got nothing like that.

01:06:39.094 --> 01:06:42.061
What about your birthdays?

01:06:42.063 --> 01:06:44.199
Your favorite
birthday cake?

01:06:47.202 --> 01:06:50.606
We never celebrated
birthdays.

01:06:52.106 --> 01:06:54.710
Never had a birthday cake.

01:06:57.478 --> 01:06:59.447
Never?

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.186
Betty, please, please, I...

01:07:07.188 --> 01:07:09.856
I don't have
a happiest memory,

01:07:09.858 --> 01:07:11.590
and I never had
a birthday cake,

01:07:11.592 --> 01:07:14.860
and if I ever opened a glass
door then take out a figurine,

01:07:14.862 --> 01:07:16.628
my mother probably
would have made me eat one

01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:19.335
to make damn sure
I never did it again.

01:07:24.271 --> 01:07:25.304
I'm sorry.

01:07:25.306 --> 01:07:26.405
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:07:26.407 --> 01:07:28.273
Look, I don't want you
to think...

01:07:28.275 --> 01:07:30.178
that I'm strange, or...

01:07:33.715 --> 01:07:36.749
You're the strangest man
I've ever met, Joe.

01:07:36.751 --> 01:07:38.387
[laughs]

01:07:41.155 --> 01:07:43.525
And you should know...

01:07:46.293 --> 01:07:49.896
I'm falling madly in love
with you.

01:07:49.898 --> 01:07:52.334
[sighs]

01:08:04.211 --> 01:08:06.479
[bells tolling distantly]

01:08:06.481 --> 01:08:08.548
[sighs]

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:10.519
Sweet Jesus.

01:08:14.222 --> 01:08:16.292
Career suicide.

01:08:19.661 --> 01:08:23.328
I wonder what my friends down
south are saying about Weedy

01:08:23.331 --> 01:08:27.433
and his new dark,
oiled-up friend.

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:29.268
Down there they'd lynch
them both.

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:31.340
[laughs]

01:08:34.943 --> 01:08:36.608
Oh!

01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:37.809
Hmm.

01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:39.245
That kike.

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:40.379
[laughs]

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:42.247
What do you think, Jerry?

01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:44.286
[laughing]

01:08:45.353 --> 01:08:47.823
Oh, it's good to be king.

01:08:49.323 --> 01:08:50.490
Mm-hmm.

01:08:50.492 --> 01:08:52.258
[Joe]
There's three articles in here

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.893
that were featured in one
of our publications first.

01:08:53.895 --> 01:08:56.629
And then, of course,
there's this.

01:08:56.631 --> 01:08:58.464
And this.

01:08:58.466 --> 01:09:00.899
[Kate] You know Lucky Strike and
Miller have contacted us too.

01:09:00.902 --> 01:09:04.636
I mean, with all our
new magazines sucking money,

01:09:04.639 --> 01:09:06.371
it's hard to make
our profit margins.

01:09:06.372 --> 01:09:08.441
Did Bennie tell you
to say that?

01:09:08.443 --> 01:09:09.942
Margins pay all our salaries,
Joe.

01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:11.743
And alcohol and cigarettes
kill people.

01:09:11.746 --> 01:09:13.513
They go against everything
we stand for and believe in.

01:09:13.515 --> 01:09:16.448
Yeah, I'm not so sure
it's that black and white.

01:09:16.451 --> 01:09:18.283
There are people
who like to exercise

01:09:18.286 --> 01:09:19.952
and also have
an occasional drink.

01:09:19.953 --> 01:09:21.620
Even a smoke.

01:09:21.622 --> 01:09:24.357
It's 1957, Joe. It's...
It's the modern world.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:25.924
No, it's not.

01:09:25.926 --> 01:09:29.294
The modern world is what
we sell in our magazine.

01:09:29.296 --> 01:09:31.964
A world of vitamins,
protein shakes,

01:09:31.966 --> 01:09:34.000
vegetable juice,
vitality.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:35.367
[scoffs]

01:09:35.368 --> 01:09:36.402
Now I need a drink.

01:09:36.404 --> 01:09:37.437
Well, then have a protein shake.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.839
I'm going to need
a martini.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.541
You know, if the day comes where
the world is getting together

01:09:42.542 --> 01:09:43.675
over a protein shake,

01:09:43.676 --> 01:09:47.346
I do believe
that I will be long dead.

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:48.548
Ah, yes, Barton,

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:50.782
from all the liquor
and the cigarettes.

01:09:50.783 --> 01:09:51.917
[laughs]

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.254
Hey, the Weider way
is the honest way.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:56.321
We practice what we preach.

01:09:56.323 --> 01:09:58.290
I like that.
Write that down.

01:09:58.292 --> 01:10:00.727
That will be on the next cover.
She's a sharp gal. I told you.

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:04.796
You know,
I'm a sharp gal, too, Joe.

01:10:04.798 --> 01:10:09.568
And, unfortunately, we will need
some of those sinful ads,

01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:11.937
or there will be no way
to deliver

01:10:11.939 --> 01:10:15.877
our prophet's message
at all.

01:10:18.546 --> 01:10:20.545
Leave the anti-body ads
to Bill Hauk.

01:10:20.547 --> 01:10:24.349
We're in the health
business.

01:10:24.351 --> 01:10:25.852
What's next?

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:28.521
[phone ringing]

01:10:28.523 --> 01:10:30.859
[Joe]
Betty, can you get that?

01:10:35.462 --> 01:10:37.030
Hello?

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:39.932
Hello, Mr. Hawkins.

01:10:39.934 --> 01:10:42.371
Joe.

01:10:43.438 --> 01:10:44.974
Just a moment.

01:10:48.976 --> 01:10:50.543
Hello, Roy.

01:10:50.545 --> 01:10:51.443
<i>How's the weather
in New York?</i>

01:10:51.445 --> 01:10:53.345
Oh, the bitter cold
is not comforting,

01:10:53.347 --> 01:10:56.449
but I'm sorry to say, Joe,

01:10:56.451 --> 01:10:58.520
it's the least
of my problems.

01:10:59.587 --> 01:11:01.387
I'm finished, Joe.

01:11:01.389 --> 01:11:03.656
American News is bankrupt.

01:11:03.658 --> 01:11:05.357
Huh.

01:11:05.359 --> 01:11:07.427
Call his writers.

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:10.495
See who needs
a paying job.

01:11:10.497 --> 01:11:13.398
I want them all, Jerry.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.037
Jerry...

01:11:16.404 --> 01:11:17.873
all of them.

01:11:28.615 --> 01:11:30.985
You've got new competition.

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:39.560
Screw that bastard,
Hauk.

01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:44.996
It's mine, Joe.

01:11:44.998 --> 01:11:47.769
I'm sorry.
I got kids to feed.

01:11:55.409 --> 01:11:58.678
Katie's coming with me as well.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.883
[breathing heavily]

01:12:09.157 --> 01:12:11.694
[panting]

01:12:20.568 --> 01:12:23.436
The one who should have
left first.

01:12:23.438 --> 01:12:26.041
Me? Why in the world
would I leave?

01:12:27.475 --> 01:12:28.508
Because I'm broke.

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:30.543
No, no, no.
Not broke, no.

01:12:30.545 --> 01:12:32.648
A million dollars in debt.

01:12:34.515 --> 01:12:37.683
A new kind
of millionaire.

01:12:37.685 --> 01:12:40.589
The regular ones are boring,
Joe, believe me.

01:12:42.122 --> 01:12:44.557
Hey...

01:12:44.559 --> 01:12:48.593
any pretty gal can find herself
a rich man, Joe.

01:12:48.595 --> 01:12:50.562
This gal?

01:12:50.564 --> 01:12:53.965
This gal needs more.

01:12:53.967 --> 01:12:56.936
You're not the only big dreamer
that needs to build something.

01:12:56.938 --> 01:13:00.943
Hey. You're stuck with me.

01:13:06.514 --> 01:13:07.580
Betty, how...

01:13:07.582 --> 01:13:10.916
how would you like
to get stuck, like, officially?

01:13:10.918 --> 01:13:12.184
For good?

01:13:12.186 --> 01:13:17.693
Make me the richest
broke man in the world?

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.630
Richer or poorer, yes?

01:13:23.765 --> 01:13:28.468
Wait, wait, wait, was that yes
a "yes" or was that a question?

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:30.606
I thought you'd never ask.

01:13:34.742 --> 01:13:36.945
[cheers and applause]

01:13:42.516 --> 01:13:44.619
In all the world.

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:47.055
In all the world.

01:13:51.592 --> 01:13:53.729
[cameras snap]

01:13:58.765 --> 01:14:01.500
Please don't stop.
Wait a sec, stop.

01:14:01.502 --> 01:14:02.567
Stop.

01:14:02.569 --> 01:14:05.071
Now these
are Hauk men.

01:14:05.073 --> 01:14:07.572
[all cheer]

01:14:07.574 --> 01:14:09.208
[laughs]

01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:13.646
Now, their builds are merely
by-products of their strength,

01:14:13.648 --> 01:14:14.914
not the other way around.

01:14:14.916 --> 01:14:19.619
These world-class athletes seek
my experience, little old me.

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.987
While other so-called trainers
are busy

01:14:21.989 --> 01:14:25.625
putting loincloths
on greased-up Negroes.

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:26.692
[laughter]

01:14:26.694 --> 01:14:29.829

don't you?

01:14:29.831 --> 01:14:33.665
I deal in champions,
while my competitor deals

01:14:33.667 --> 01:14:36.102
in Negro homo smut.

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:38.137

[Jimmy] The Weider brothers say
that the IFBB

01:14:40.574 --> 01:14:43.675
is looking to make bodybuilding
an Olympic event.

01:14:43.677 --> 01:14:45.277
[Bill] Do they say that?
Is that right?

01:14:45.279 --> 01:14:47.679
Hmm, well, I believe that
they're focused

01:14:47.681 --> 01:14:48.815
on filing for bankruptcy
right now,

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:53.251
because they and their
disgusting magazines are done.

01:14:53.253 --> 01:14:55.220
[Bronson] Joe Weider says
he's boycotting the AAU

01:14:55.222 --> 01:14:57.557
and this competition.
What you say about that?

01:14:57.559 --> 01:15:01.093
Weedy is not here, because he
doesn't dare to show his face.

01:15:01.095 --> 01:15:03.862
Okay? That, and also,
he can't afford a ticket.

01:15:03.864 --> 01:15:06.264
- [laughter]
- I don't think any of us here

01:15:06.266 --> 01:15:08.867

federation of his

01:15:08.869 --> 01:15:10.969
and his little
blonde bombshell.

01:15:10.971 --> 01:15:12.772
- I mean, honestly...
- Can I print that?

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:15.741
You don't have to.
I'll do it myself.

01:15:15.743 --> 01:15:18.311
- [laughter]
- I shall call the piece,

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:20.845
"Where, oh, where is Weedy?"

01:15:20.847 --> 01:15:22.315
His name is Joe Weider,

01:15:22.317 --> 01:15:25.851
and I'm here in his place,
you lowlife son of a bitch.

01:15:25.853 --> 01:15:29.821
Well, well,
lookit who we have here.

01:15:29.823 --> 01:15:32.325
It's little Weedy.

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:33.793
What's the problem?

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:36.262
Would you rather
that I call him...

01:15:36.264 --> 01:15:37.362
the Jew?

01:15:37.364 --> 01:15:38.363
[all gasp]

01:15:38.365 --> 01:15:41.032
- What did you say?
- [Bill] Why all the gasps?

01:15:41.034 --> 01:15:43.235
He is J-E-W.

01:15:43.237 --> 01:15:45.204
Joseph Edward Weider.

01:15:45.206 --> 01:15:46.606
Isn't that right?

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:48.844
Huh?

01:15:51.212 --> 01:15:52.915
Get off!

01:15:54.314 --> 01:15:56.949
[screams]

01:15:56.951 --> 01:15:59.218
Hey, I got him.
Let him go. Let him go.

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:02.220
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Come here.

01:16:02.222 --> 01:16:05.790
Why you got to go
and destroy all the fun, Jerry?

01:16:05.792 --> 01:16:07.293
Huh?

01:16:07.295 --> 01:16:08.960
Ooh!

01:16:08.962 --> 01:16:12.665
These Jews are so sensitive
these days, aren't they?

01:16:12.667 --> 01:16:14.232
[laughter]

01:16:14.234 --> 01:16:16.268
Get off me!

01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:18.236
What are you,
trying to get yourself killed?

01:16:18.238 --> 01:16:20.839
- If it isn't Jerry George.
- Hey, you're better than that.

01:16:20.841 --> 01:16:23.308
That lowlife son of a bitch
crossed the line, you know it.

01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:27.013
And to think my brother and I used
to look up to you when we were kids.

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:29.648
I sold your brother
his first weight set.

01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:30.650
And me too.

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:32.817
And now you stand
with this pig anti-Semite,

01:16:32.819 --> 01:16:34.285
basking in his glory.

01:16:34.287 --> 01:16:35.754
Shame on you.

01:16:35.756 --> 01:16:37.822
Hey, wait, Ben. Wait a second.

01:16:37.824 --> 01:16:39.791
Look, maybe Hauk's right.

01:16:39.793 --> 01:16:43.795
Maybe there's Hauk men
and there's Weider men.

01:16:43.797 --> 01:16:45.764
But I am not a Hauk man.

01:16:45.766 --> 01:16:47.732
No, you're his puppet.

01:16:47.734 --> 01:16:49.835
You watch your mouth
if you want to keep your teeth.

01:16:49.837 --> 01:16:51.937
- [scoffs]
- The truth is,

01:16:51.939 --> 01:16:54.839
I would rather
be a Weider man.

01:16:54.841 --> 01:16:57.009
I admire you
and your brother.

01:16:57.011 --> 01:17:00.845
Hauk's an embarrassment,
and he's outdated,

01:17:00.847 --> 01:17:04.282
and so is his branch
of the damn AAU.

01:17:04.284 --> 01:17:06.419
We have nothing
to offer you.

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:07.887
Oh, but you do.

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:11.991
I want to make bodybuilding
stand on its own,

01:17:11.993 --> 01:17:15.428
take its rightful place
as a legitimate sport.

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:16.463
In order for that to happen,

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.798
you need to make the IFBB
stand for something.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.733
Give it an official standing.

01:17:21.735 --> 01:17:24.870
I've traveled all over
the world getting signatures...

01:17:24.872 --> 01:17:26.772
There'll be time for that.

01:17:26.774 --> 01:17:27.906
Look, right now,

01:17:27.908 --> 01:17:30.942
focus on your stature
in the bodybuilding community.

01:17:30.944 --> 01:17:34.879
And you and Joe need to mount
a serious challenge to Hauk.

01:17:34.881 --> 01:17:38.352
The IFBB can win.

01:17:40.454 --> 01:17:41.687
It will win.

01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:45.458
Nobody cares about this sport
more than my brother and I.

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.927
You do that,

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:50.899
then you can
count on me to help.

01:17:56.369 --> 01:17:57.236
Welcome back,
Bennie.

01:17:57.238 --> 01:17:59.839
Fancy man,
ride in the back now, huh?

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.473
You look good. You look good.

01:18:01.475 --> 01:18:03.476
Don't worry,
we'll get your bags.

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:04.876
Come on.

01:18:04.878 --> 01:18:06.012
It will be
a cold day in hell

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:09.882
if they think they can
snatch away what we've built.

01:18:09.884 --> 01:18:12.220
I've missed you too,
Bennie.

01:18:13.921 --> 01:18:15.321
We'll get another
distributor.

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:18.057
That will be easy
when the IFBB is recognized

01:18:18.059 --> 01:18:19.791
as the governing body
of our sport,

01:18:19.793 --> 01:18:23.394
with the only democratically
elected governing council.

01:18:23.396 --> 01:18:24.228
What's the plan?

01:18:24.230 --> 01:18:26.464
We make Mr. Universe
look penny ante.

01:18:26.466 --> 01:18:28.366
We reach out to every
bodybuilder we know

01:18:28.368 --> 01:18:30.870
and we ask them to join us
in building the largest, fairest

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:35.007
and most globally recognized
bodybuilding contest in history.

01:18:35.009 --> 01:18:37.041
Jerry George has agreed
to travel the world

01:18:37.043 --> 01:18:38.811
and bring in talent
from everywhere.

01:18:38.813 --> 01:18:40.912
You reach out
to the bodybuilders,

01:18:40.914 --> 01:18:42.248
get them in
the Weider program,

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.049
and I'll get their countries
to join the IFBB later.

01:18:44.051 --> 01:18:47.085
I have not lost sight
of the bigger picture, Joe.

01:18:47.087 --> 01:18:49.220
I'm going to get us
into the Olympics.

01:18:49.222 --> 01:18:52.124
Bodybuilding is essential
to nation building.

01:18:52.126 --> 01:18:56.064
And this competition
is essential to bodybuilding.

01:18:57.297 --> 01:18:59.098
Since when are you
the idea man, hmm?

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.901
You know, you... you're supposed
to be the realist.

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:03.001
Yeah, well,
some guys have it all.

01:19:03.003 --> 01:19:05.970
- Oh.
- We have to be married to this.

01:19:05.972 --> 01:19:06.938
You were always
right about that.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.808
Well, Bennie,
I am married.

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:10.108
Not now, Joe.

01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:11.910
- What?
- I'm serious. Cut the crap.

01:19:11.912 --> 01:19:14.014
We got a lot of work to do.

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:30.528
[Jerry] Never thought I'd see
Joe Weider drinking a beer.

01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:34.532
Only for very special occasions,
and tonight: special occasion.

01:19:34.534 --> 01:19:36.936
Larry, I have to say,
you really wowed them

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:38.137
with those guns
at Mr. Universe.

01:19:38.139 --> 01:19:40.004
[Larry] Well, I have
to thank you for that.

01:19:40.006 --> 01:19:43.142
I actually used the Weider
arm method from your magazine.

01:19:43.144 --> 01:19:45.577
Mm, yes, but the real
question is,

01:19:45.579 --> 01:19:47.245
where do you go from here.

01:19:47.247 --> 01:19:50.049
Because, you know, once you're
Mr. Universe, you're done.

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:51.616
Well, I have given that
some thought, Joe.

01:19:51.618 --> 01:19:55.486
And I think I have to get out
of competitive bodybuilding.

01:19:55.488 --> 01:19:57.223
I just hope I can still
do some work modeling.

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:59.325
- Well, that is a damn shame.
- [Larry] What is?

01:19:59.327 --> 01:20:01.994
[Joe] After you become Mr. Universe,
you cannot go any higher.

01:20:01.996 --> 01:20:03.963
You get punished
for your greatness.

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:05.964
But what if I told you

01:20:05.966 --> 01:20:07.000
the IFBB is creating

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:09.468
a world professional
bodybuilding championship

01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:13.037
you can compete as many times
as you want, defend your title.

01:20:13.039 --> 01:20:14.039
[laughs]

01:20:14.041 --> 01:20:17.009
I'd say, where do I sign up?

01:20:17.011 --> 01:20:19.911
So, what's this competition
going to called?

01:20:19.913 --> 01:20:22.149
Well, we're working
on that.

01:20:23.016 --> 01:20:26.487
What about Mr. Olympia?

01:20:28.488 --> 01:20:29.988
Olympia. That's...

01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:32.057
that's perfect.

01:20:32.059 --> 01:20:33.125
Betty you're full
of surprises.

01:20:33.127 --> 01:20:36.961

with that?

to be Mr. Olympia.

01:21:53.006 --> 01:21:55.206
[whistles blowing]

01:21:55.208 --> 01:21:57.444
[indistinct shouting]

01:22:00.314 --> 01:22:02.417
[yells]

01:22:08.756 --> 01:22:10.254
Sir, this is Ben Weider,

01:22:10.256 --> 01:22:12.523
president of the IFBB
and Mr. Olympia.

01:22:12.525 --> 01:22:14.259
If I could have
a moment of your time,

01:22:14.261 --> 01:22:17.062
I'd like to bring something
to your attention.

01:22:17.064 --> 01:22:19.063
Well, I'm glad you asked.

01:22:19.065 --> 01:22:21.200
Bodybuilding belongs
in the Olympics.

01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:24.135
Yes, sir,
we think it does.

01:22:24.137 --> 01:22:25.004
No, I agree.

01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:26.705
You cannot see yellow
clearly on red.

01:22:26.707 --> 01:22:29.208
- Do you not know that?
- I'll fix it, Mr. Weider.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:30.709
And reverse-print
the title.

01:22:30.711 --> 01:22:33.178
It needs to be white on a dark
background so it pops.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.713
Your color schemes
are awful today.

01:22:34.715 --> 01:22:37.249
- It's just a mistake, Joe.
- I don't have time for mistakes.

01:22:37.251 --> 01:22:39.518
- It needs to be perfect.
- Yes, Mr. Weider.

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.385
[Jerry]
Joe.

01:22:40.387 --> 01:22:42.220
Hello, Jerry.
How was the world tour?

01:22:42.222 --> 01:22:44.223
Some exciting
new talent out there.

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:46.625
I'll tell you about it.

01:22:46.627 --> 01:22:48.794
Norwegians.

01:22:48.796 --> 01:22:50.396
Hungarians.

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:51.363
Austrians.

01:22:51.365 --> 01:22:55.233
So many impressive hopefuls
I lost count.

01:22:55.235 --> 01:22:56.768
Let's see.
Let's see some of these bodies.

01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:59.303
What are we...?
Hmm, that's good, that's good.

01:22:59.305 --> 01:23:01.373
Wait, hold on.
Who... who is this?

01:23:01.375 --> 01:23:03.208
[Jerry]
Arnold Schwarz... Schwarz...

01:23:03.210 --> 01:23:05.244
I couldn't pronounce
his last name if you paid me.

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:07.379
Everyone in the gym
calls him the Oak.

01:23:07.381 --> 01:23:09.415
There's another photo of him
at the end.

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:12.084
My God. Betty, look.
Look at his face.

01:23:12.086 --> 01:23:13.285
Pure determination.

01:23:13.287 --> 01:23:15.120
What a specimen.
Where's he from?

01:23:15.122 --> 01:23:16.354
Austria.

01:23:16.356 --> 01:23:17.455
[Joe]
Do you see it? See the look?

01:23:17.457 --> 01:23:20.125
- Fire in his eyes. The steel.
- I saw it in person.

01:23:20.127 --> 01:23:22.326
See, that is what the tough guys
in the movies should look like,

01:23:22.328 --> 01:23:23.695
- you ask me.
- Are you kidding me?

01:23:23.697 --> 01:23:26.464
- His biceps would fill a screen.
- Nonsense.

01:23:26.466 --> 01:23:28.135
Wait.

01:23:29.203 --> 01:23:30.572
Hold on.

01:23:41.314 --> 01:23:42.680
Look at that. Go.
Tell Molly to book us

01:23:42.682 --> 01:23:44.282
two plane tickets
to Austria right now.

01:23:44.284 --> 01:23:46.518
Will do. Oh, and Joe?

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:50.358
- Hauk passed on him.
- Even better.

01:23:52.126 --> 01:23:53.724
Oh, my God.

01:23:53.726 --> 01:23:55.630
We found him.

01:24:24.257 --> 01:24:26.226
[Joe] Hello, Arnold?

01:24:29.195 --> 01:24:31.196
My name is Joe Weider.

01:24:31.198 --> 01:24:33.298
I know.
I read the books.

01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.901
- Yes, those are my magazines.
- IFBB.

01:24:35.903 --> 01:24:38.236
- That is my federation.
- I've seen your picture.

01:24:38.238 --> 01:24:39.905
And I have pictures of you.

01:24:39.907 --> 01:24:41.643
Come look.

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:50.618
It's me.

01:24:51.918 --> 01:24:53.485
Who made it?

01:24:53.487 --> 01:24:55.320
I did.

01:24:55.322 --> 01:24:58.490
I've been drawing it
my entire life.

01:24:58.492 --> 01:25:01.425
How would you like to be
the face of bodybuilding?

01:25:01.427 --> 01:25:03.495
I want to compete
in Mr. Olympia.

01:25:03.497 --> 01:25:06.430
You train with me,
you will win Mr. Olympia.

01:25:06.432 --> 01:25:08.634
I want to win
Mr. Olympia.

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:10.235
Only once?

01:25:10.237 --> 01:25:11.436
[laughs]

01:25:11.438 --> 01:25:12.637
If you're going to win,

01:25:12.639 --> 01:25:14.873
we're going to need to catch
those legs up to that chest.

01:25:14.875 --> 01:25:17.442
It's too big. The States
is all about proportion.

01:25:17.444 --> 01:25:18.276
You must get bigger.

01:25:18.278 --> 01:25:20.211
Do you have
a power squatter here?

01:25:20.213 --> 01:25:22.446
No, no, no.
I do wine barrels.

01:25:22.448 --> 01:25:25.317
Wine barrels?

01:25:25.319 --> 01:25:28.187
That's creative,
but we can do better.

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:29.554
Much better.

01:25:29.556 --> 01:25:30.488
Okay.

01:25:30.490 --> 01:25:32.793
That's not bad,
though.

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.227
I like that.

01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:36.928
I made it.

01:25:36.930 --> 01:25:39.867
Go on.
I'll wait for you.

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:49.444
- [grunts]
- Good. Rack it.

01:25:53.279 --> 01:25:55.649
Not bad, huh?

01:25:57.283 --> 01:25:59.351
I read your articles.

01:25:59.353 --> 01:26:00.518
You used to compete.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.388
Mm-hmm, when I was younger.
But after my shoulder, no.

01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:05.257
What happened?

01:26:05.259 --> 01:26:07.326
Bill Hauk happened.

01:26:07.328 --> 01:26:08.460
Long story.

01:26:08.462 --> 01:26:10.428
He said to me
that I'm useless

01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:15.500
and that Americans never
would get past my ugly face.

01:26:15.502 --> 01:26:18.373
That sounds like Hauk.
Come on.

01:26:19.239 --> 01:26:21.376
[grunts]

01:26:22.542 --> 01:26:26.445
Use some of that anger, huh?
Come on.

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:29.313
Yes, that... that is how a man
channels his anger.

01:26:29.315 --> 01:26:30.882
- Come on.
- [grunts]

01:26:30.884 --> 01:26:33.418
Let's go. Two more.

01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:36.388
- One more. One more.
- [grunting]

01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:38.423
One more. Last one.
Come on.

01:26:38.425 --> 01:26:40.992
- Rack it.
- [yells]

01:26:40.994 --> 01:26:42.893
Good. Good.

01:26:42.895 --> 01:26:45.597
- You said only two more.
- I know. I lied.

01:26:45.599 --> 01:26:47.933
Arnold, I am training you
to be the best in the world.

01:26:47.935 --> 01:26:50.872
Nothing less.
Are we on the same page?

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:53.338
Yes.

01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.741
Joe, I'll give you my best.

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:56.875
Good.

01:26:56.877 --> 01:27:00.745
Steep mountain to climb,
but we will get there together.

01:27:00.747 --> 01:27:02.916
Twenty seconds.

01:27:06.319 --> 01:27:08.586
Jack, meet the Oak.

01:27:08.588 --> 01:27:10.421
Arnold, Jack LaLanne.

01:27:10.423 --> 01:27:12.958
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:17.396
Wow. American gyms
really are the best.

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:18.530
Yeah? You like my place?

01:27:18.532 --> 01:27:21.299
Yeah. Let's party.

01:27:21.301 --> 01:27:23.438
[laughs]
Okay.

01:27:24.305 --> 01:27:25.536
Wow.

01:27:25.538 --> 01:27:27.505
I think you found
another new species.

01:27:27.507 --> 01:27:29.743
[cheers and applause]

01:27:35.548 --> 01:27:37.516
I'm listed as the favorite
to win Olympia,

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:39.518
and then this happens.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.553
Can you get me as big as him?

01:27:41.555 --> 01:27:44.623
[Joe]
Frank, you're an Aston Martin.

01:27:44.625 --> 01:27:46.491
Like James Bond drives.

01:27:46.493 --> 01:27:48.527
But him...

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:50.094
he is more Mack truck.

01:27:50.096 --> 01:27:51.562
You're a good sport, Frank.

01:27:51.564 --> 01:27:53.365
[Frank]
I don't have a choice, Joe.

01:27:53.367 --> 01:27:54.936
That guy's incredible.

01:28:03.377 --> 01:28:04.543
- [chair cracks]
- Oh! Arnold.

01:28:04.545 --> 01:28:06.577
- [Betty laughs]
- Are you all right?

01:28:06.579 --> 01:28:09.880
Sure. I didn't mean
to break the damn chair.

01:28:09.882 --> 01:28:11.383
[laughs]

01:28:11.385 --> 01:28:12.317
That's my favorite chair.

01:28:12.319 --> 01:28:14.018
Betty, you know how much
I love that chair.

01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:15.689
[Ben]
Joe...

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:19.527
we need to talk.

01:28:27.467 --> 01:28:30.070
[Hebrew chanting]

01:29:44.645 --> 01:29:48.946
[Joe] <i>All my life,
people asked me what drove me?</i>

01:29:48.948 --> 01:29:53.120
<i>It wasn't until she died
I realized...</i>

01:29:54.188 --> 01:29:55.653
<i>she did.</i>

01:29:55.655 --> 01:29:59.191
What the child needs
and doesn't get,

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:02.930
he searches for
his whole life.

01:30:09.036 --> 01:30:11.105
As it turns out...

01:30:12.639 --> 01:30:14.238
Arnold had needs too,

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:19.044
and he was searching also.

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:21.615
[Arnold grunting]

01:30:22.682 --> 01:30:25.683
[Joe]
Come on.

01:30:25.685 --> 01:30:27.818
Come on, you can do it.
Come on.

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:28.687
Five more.

01:30:28.689 --> 01:30:30.789
The other guy,
he just did two more.

01:30:30.791 --> 01:30:32.059
Come on.

01:30:33.126 --> 01:30:34.526
Push.

01:30:34.528 --> 01:30:36.061
Come on, last one.
One more.

01:30:36.063 --> 01:30:37.896
[grunts]

01:30:37.898 --> 01:30:39.734
Good. Rack it.

01:30:47.173 --> 01:30:48.876
Showoff.

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.049
Keep the arms up.

01:30:58.051 --> 01:30:59.518
Yes...

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.589
[indistinct chatter]

01:31:07.961 --> 01:31:11.696
Arnold, I want you to do one
important thing for me tonight.

01:31:11.698 --> 01:31:13.665
All right?

01:31:13.667 --> 01:31:15.099
Have fun.
Do what you do best.

01:31:15.101 --> 01:31:17.669
You make them laugh
and they'll love you.

01:31:17.671 --> 01:31:19.838
[Bill]
Why, hello, Joe.

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.673
[Joe] I apologize.

01:31:21.675 --> 01:31:23.674
I do not believe
we allow convicts backstage.

01:31:23.676 --> 01:31:27.278
Well, I trained
Sergio here.

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:30.682
He is sanctioned,
and he is competing here today.

01:31:30.684 --> 01:31:32.717
Well, you can still wait outside
like everybody else.

01:31:32.719 --> 01:31:35.152
Another low blow
from Joe Schmo, huh?

01:31:35.154 --> 01:31:39.758
Have you even taken a look
at this Cuban god?

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.927
His waist is actually
smaller than his thighs.

01:31:41.929 --> 01:31:44.728
He's just going to wipe
the floor with your guy.

01:31:44.730 --> 01:31:45.796
So there you go.

01:31:45.798 --> 01:31:49.034
Maybe I'll let him
wipe my ass.

01:31:49.036 --> 01:31:50.634
Get a good seat.

01:31:50.636 --> 01:31:52.003
[scoffs]

01:31:52.005 --> 01:31:53.138
Look at you.

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.706
It seems you've made
some progress

01:31:55.708 --> 01:31:57.875
in spite of Weedy here.

01:31:57.877 --> 01:31:59.744
I knew you had it in you.

01:31:59.746 --> 01:32:01.745
Break a leg, Arnold.

01:32:01.747 --> 01:32:03.750
Maybe I'll break
your jaw instead.

01:32:06.686 --> 01:32:08.989
You show them what you got.

01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:16.861
Well, I believe that you handled
that quite well.

01:32:16.863 --> 01:32:18.662
You might have a future
in the pictures.

01:32:18.664 --> 01:32:19.998
Nobody understands me.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.601
I believe that Hauk
understood you loud and clear.

01:32:22.603 --> 01:32:24.902
Hmm? Come on. Pump.

01:32:24.904 --> 01:32:27.638
[Betty] Why, yes, I did
create the title "Mr. Olympia"

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:28.807
a few years ago, actually,

01:32:28.809 --> 01:32:30.709
when we were just all
sitting around...

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:32.611
[clearing throat]

01:32:32.613 --> 01:32:35.013
Mrs. Weedy,
don't you look nice.

01:32:35.015 --> 01:32:37.949
Would you like to join me
in the winner's section?

01:32:37.951 --> 01:32:38.916
[laughs]

01:32:38.918 --> 01:32:42.387
You do create strong
competitors, Mr. Hauk.

01:32:42.389 --> 01:32:43.921
- Thank you.
- But to create

01:32:43.923 --> 01:32:48.660
an impeccable man,
it takes dignity and grace.

01:32:48.662 --> 01:32:51.295
Qualities you know
nothing about.

01:32:51.297 --> 01:32:53.067
Good luck.

01:33:04.677 --> 01:33:06.247
As we were saying.

01:33:12.386 --> 01:33:14.055
[inhales and exhales]

01:33:21.328 --> 01:33:23.695
[sighs]

01:33:23.697 --> 01:33:24.928
[applause]

01:33:24.930 --> 01:33:26.363
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:33:26.365 --> 01:33:28.767
welcome to the premiere event
in men's bodybuilding.

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:29.601
Good luck.

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:33.838
[announcer]
The IFBB Mr. Olympia.

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:38.043
Remember, have fun
and make them laugh.

01:33:38.045 --> 01:33:39.814
Go on.

01:33:41.213 --> 01:33:42.746
[applause]

01:33:42.748 --> 01:33:48.221
Here they are, the best
bodybuilders in the world.

01:33:54.927 --> 01:33:57.995
[commentator 1] What do you think
they're looking for out there this year?

01:33:57.997 --> 01:33:59.930
[commentator 2] They're looking
for three things.

01:33:59.932 --> 01:34:01.965
Mass, symmetry, and they're
looking for definition.

01:34:01.967 --> 01:34:04.268
And it looks like we've got
all three of those

01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:05.870
in spades tonight.

01:34:05.872 --> 01:34:08.772
These physiques are among
the best we've ever seen.

01:34:08.774 --> 01:34:10.008
They sure are.
I tell you what,

01:34:10.010 --> 01:34:12.009
these are not just bodybuilders,
they're artists.

01:34:12.011 --> 01:34:13.144
They have been working all year,

01:34:13.146 --> 01:34:15.446
carving, sculpting their
physiques just for this moment.

01:34:15.448 --> 01:34:18.817
[commentator 2] Human sculptures
like we've never seen before.

01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:22.019
These should be in the halls
of every museum, everywhere.

01:34:22.021 --> 01:34:27.060
This is what Joe Weider has
been picturing his entire life.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.769
<i>♪ I can turn
Your gray sky blue ♪</i>

01:34:38.771 --> 01:34:41.906
<i>♪ I can make it rain
Whenever I want it to ♪</i>

01:34:41.908 --> 01:34:43.942
[commentator 1]
This contest really comes down

01:34:43.944 --> 01:34:45.777
to Sergio and Arnold.

01:34:45.779 --> 01:34:46.910
<i>♪ From a single grain of sand ♪</i>

01:34:46.912 --> 01:34:49.947
<i>♪ I can make a ship sail... ♪</i>

01:34:49.949 --> 01:34:52.016
[commentator 2] Is it just me,
or does Arnold look like

01:34:52.018 --> 01:34:53.751
he's actually having fun
on that stage?

01:34:53.753 --> 01:34:56.353
I mean, this is big time.
This is for the title

01:34:56.355 --> 01:34:58.356
or Mr. Olympia,

01:34:58.358 --> 01:35:00.224
and Arnold has turned this
into his own playground.

01:35:00.226 --> 01:35:02.893
I mean, he's mocking Sergio
on stage.

01:35:02.895 --> 01:35:03.995
[commentator 1]
This in incredible.

01:35:03.997 --> 01:35:05.463
We've never seen
anything like this.

01:35:05.465 --> 01:35:06.930
<i>♪ I can't get next

01:35:06.932 --> 01:35:09.800

01:35:09.802 --> 01:35:10.902
[commentator 2]
All right,

01:35:10.904 --> 01:35:13.004
it looks like the boys are done
with their pose now.

01:35:13.006 --> 01:35:14.839
Arnold leaning over
and telling Sergio something.

01:35:14.841 --> 01:35:16.941
It looks like they're ready
to call it a day.

01:35:16.943 --> 01:35:19.376
Sergio is making his way
off the stage.

01:35:19.378 --> 01:35:24.018
Arnold making his way...
wait a minute.

01:35:26.086 --> 01:35:27.451
Arnold is not making his way
off the stage.

01:35:27.453 --> 01:35:29.888
Arnold turned around
and came back.

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:32.924
He is playing to the crowd.
He's starting to hit poses.

01:35:32.926 --> 01:35:33.791
[all cheering]

01:35:33.793 --> 01:35:36.494
The crowd is going
absolutely crazy.

01:35:36.496 --> 01:35:38.428
He is whipping them up
into a frenzy.

01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:42.400
We have never, ever seen
anything like this onstage.

01:35:42.402 --> 01:35:45.035
Arnold just completely pulling
the wool over Sergio's eyes.

01:35:45.037 --> 01:35:48.839
The crowd is absolutely nuts
at this point.

01:35:48.841 --> 01:35:50.241
And here comes Sergio.

01:35:50.243 --> 01:35:53.980
[commentator 1] Tell you this right
now: he does not look too happy.

01:36:01.287 --> 01:36:03.423
[drumroll]

01:36:06.859 --> 01:36:07.991
Your winner,

01:36:07.993 --> 01:36:11.062
and your 1970
Mr. Olympia...

01:36:11.064 --> 01:36:12.996
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

01:36:12.998 --> 01:36:15.967
[crowd cheers]

01:36:15.969 --> 01:36:17.402
[commentator 1]
And that's it.

01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:21.438
Arnold Schwarzenegger,
your new Mr. Olympia.

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:24.010
We have a new champion.

01:36:33.619 --> 01:36:35.452
[cheers]

01:36:35.454 --> 01:36:38.156
I don't think Joe could be
any happier right now.

01:36:38.158 --> 01:36:39.991
What a long road getting here.

01:36:39.993 --> 01:36:40.991
[commentator 2]
All their hard work,

01:36:40.993 --> 01:36:42.527
all their determination.

01:36:42.529 --> 01:36:43.861
They took a chance,

01:36:43.863 --> 01:36:46.567
and it's really
paying off.

01:36:50.403 --> 01:36:53.937
I think we'll all be hearing
a lot from the new champ,

01:36:53.939 --> 01:36:57.110
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

01:36:58.377 --> 01:37:00.044
So, Hercules,
who are they going to get?

01:37:00.046 --> 01:37:01.979
- Yul Brynner?
- You're the only one

01:37:01.981 --> 01:37:02.848
who understands
my English, Joe.

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:04.982
Look, nobody cares
about your accent.

01:37:04.984 --> 01:37:05.851
Have you heard mine?

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:07.485
Just say the lines
the way you want.

01:37:07.487 --> 01:37:09.586
You're making him
more nervous, Joe.

01:37:09.588 --> 01:37:11.155
- What?
- I cannot act.

01:37:11.157 --> 01:37:13.357
- Then don't act.
- Just be yourself, Arnold.

01:37:13.359 --> 01:37:17.294
You told them I was a German
Shakespearian actor.

01:37:17.296 --> 01:37:19.263
- I'm so screwed.
- Arnold, Arnold, it's Hollywood.

01:37:19.265 --> 01:37:22.032
Nobody knows whether you've
done Shakespeare in the Park,

01:37:22.034 --> 01:37:23.168
or your own damn garage.

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:26.603
Just give a good flex,
nice smile, we'll all be fine.

01:37:26.605 --> 01:37:28.071
I'm freaking out!

01:37:28.073 --> 01:37:29.509
[fabric rips]

01:37:30.577 --> 01:37:32.076
[snickers]

01:37:32.078 --> 01:37:33.577
[Joe] You ripped it.
You ripped the jacket.

01:37:33.579 --> 01:37:34.646
[Betty]
He did.

01:37:34.648 --> 01:37:36.113
[Joe]
He did. All right.

01:37:36.115 --> 01:37:38.484
Can we fix that?
We need a whole new...

01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:45.993
[shuts ignition off]

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:15.119
What do you think?

01:38:15.121 --> 01:38:17.254
Well, I love it.

01:38:17.256 --> 01:38:19.324
Hmm.

01:38:19.326 --> 01:38:20.991
No.

01:38:20.993 --> 01:38:24.161
No, it's silly. It's weird.
We should get rid of it.

01:38:24.163 --> 01:38:25.996
It's not silly.

01:38:25.998 --> 01:38:28.199
I think it's perfect.

01:38:28.201 --> 01:38:32.038
It's perfectly you.

01:38:36.676 --> 01:38:38.612
Hmm.

01:38:42.548 --> 01:38:45.586
What? What is it?

01:38:52.225 --> 01:38:57.298
Do you remember you once asked
me about my happiest memory?

01:38:59.064 --> 01:39:03.136
And now I have one.

01:39:04.003 --> 01:39:06.536
You...

01:39:06.538 --> 01:39:11.377
The first time that I saw you
at Jack LaLanne's gym.

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.549
Thank you.

01:39:18.118 --> 01:39:20.018
Thank you for showing me
how it feels

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:23.557
to be so deeply loved.

01:39:26.059 --> 01:39:28.429
You've always deserved it.

01:39:33.666 --> 01:39:35.735
My love.

01:39:46.512 --> 01:39:52.383
[Joe] So many old friends
and wonderful faces here today.

01:39:52.385 --> 01:39:58.488
My brother Ben would have
enjoyed this reunion.

01:39:58.490 --> 01:40:02.559
The history of what we did
together is a great story.

01:40:02.561 --> 01:40:05.095
But no matter how many times
I tell it,

01:40:05.097 --> 01:40:08.732
it'll never tell
the entire tale.

01:40:08.734 --> 01:40:12.769
We were two poor kids

01:40:12.771 --> 01:40:14.472
chasing big dreams.

01:40:14.474 --> 01:40:19.811
There is simply no Joe Weider
without Ben Weider.

01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:24.449
We didn't start out
to change the world.

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:30.388
Oddly, that's exactly
what we did, Bennie.

01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:34.357
People often called us
"Brothers of Iron".

01:40:34.359 --> 01:40:37.663
More importantly
we were brothers in life.

01:40:39.131 --> 01:40:41.264
I'll see you soon, Ben.

01:40:41.266 --> 01:40:44.701
And when we reunite up there,

01:40:44.703 --> 01:40:47.737
we will be looking down
on all of you,

01:40:47.739 --> 01:40:53.678
making sure that you do every
last rep of every damn set...

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.545
[laughter]

01:40:54.547 --> 01:40:57.180
...so that you can get
the very best

01:40:57.182 --> 01:40:58.316
out of your bodies,

01:40:58.318 --> 01:41:02.186
and get the best
out of your lives.

01:41:02.188 --> 01:41:05.822
Believe me,
I will be watching you.

01:41:05.824 --> 01:41:08.459
Of this,
you can be sure.

01:41:08.461 --> 01:41:10.463
