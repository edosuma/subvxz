WEBVTT

00:06.207 --> 00:07.741
WOMAN:
Where you at, New Orleans?

00:07.775 --> 00:11.045
I'll tell you where I am--
I'm right here, standing watch

00:11.079 --> 00:12.813
over your a.m. commute.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.682
As you loyal listeners know,

00:14.715 --> 00:16.784
I served seven years
in the Navy.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.752
Shaped me
into the adorable deejay

00:18.786 --> 00:20.688
that y'all know and love.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.323
That's why I founded
Youth Stripes.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.425
Work with at-risk kids,
help them find

00:24.458 --> 00:26.094
a path to success,

00:26.127 --> 00:28.762
which for some
includes military service.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.631
We're gonna be fund-raising
all week.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.466
Phone lines are open.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.403
Come on, New Orleans,
show me some love.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.105
This is Kayla.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.572
You ready to go all in

00:38.606 --> 00:40.674
for Youth Stripes?
I would follow you anywhere,

00:40.708 --> 00:42.143
Petty Officer Anderson.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.545
This is my good friend
Captain Jim Grant,

00:44.578 --> 00:46.414
a real American hero.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.681
I want to tell you
I'm impressed

00:47.715 --> 00:49.150
with all the good work
you're doing.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.851
Aw, Captain, I'm blushing.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.453
GRANT:
And I'm hoping to give

00:52.486 --> 00:54.455
your fund-raiser
a jump-start this morning.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.190
What do you say?

00:56.224 --> 00:58.526
What the hell?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.128
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

01:01.695 --> 01:02.563
Captain, you there?

01:02.596 --> 01:04.798
Jim?

01:04.832 --> 01:06.200
Jim!

01:08.836 --> 01:11.539
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:11.572 --> 01:14.142
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:14.175 --> 01:16.577
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:16.610 --> 01:17.711
* How, how, how, how

01:17.745 --> 01:19.847
* Hey, hey

01:26.154 --> 01:27.588
* You gotta come on.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.160
Good morning.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.528
Morning, Christopher.
I hope you didn't eat yet.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.164
I got inspired this morning.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.898
Eggs Florentine.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.568
Well, I hope
you got enough for three.
What do you mean?

01:40.601 --> 01:42.503
Yeah.
Hey, Dad!

01:42.536 --> 01:44.238
Come on. Laurel?

01:44.272 --> 01:45.639
What a surprise!

01:45.673 --> 01:46.907
Oh, my God,
this is great!

01:46.940 --> 01:48.442
Oh.
Hey!

01:48.476 --> 01:50.444
Hi. Yeah, I just felt
like coming home.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.546
Microwave mac and cheese
does get pretty old.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.715
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Sit down. Come on.

01:54.748 --> 01:55.749
I'll get that.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.720
Eggs Florentine.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.656
I tweaked the sauce
a little bit,

02:02.690 --> 02:05.859
and, uh, well, you know,
spiced it up.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.596
I hope you like it.
I'm sure it'll be great.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.565
And I was hoping that you
might have some time to talk?

02:11.599 --> 02:14.468
Well, sure, I always got time
for you, baby girl.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.204
Come on.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.239
What's on your mind?

02:18.272 --> 02:20.208
That was NOPD, King.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.675
Got a dead Navy captain.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.680
Well,
what are you waiting for? Go.

02:26.714 --> 02:27.881
Well...
I'll clean up.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.483
Thanks.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.619
I'll be back
in a little bit.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.222
Turn off the gas.
:
I will.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.860
LASALLE:
So...

02:39.893 --> 02:42.263
Laurel's in town,
middle of the week,

02:42.296 --> 02:44.198
middle of the semester...

02:44.232 --> 02:46.767
You are always so suspicious,
Christopher.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.537
You think too much like a cop.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.239
And you don't?

02:51.272 --> 02:53.307
First thing that flashed
through my head.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.209
Something's up.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.811
Well, when we get back,
we'll eat and we'll talk.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.313
We'll get down to it.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.748
Until then...

03:00.781 --> 03:02.216
We work.

03:09.823 --> 03:10.924
No Sonja?

03:10.958 --> 03:12.626
She's with DEA
closing out

03:12.660 --> 03:13.994
the Payton
Kirk case.
Right. Well,

03:14.027 --> 03:16.664
911 received a call
8:30 this morning, shots fired.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.831
Our victim

03:17.865 --> 03:19.533
is Captain James Grant,

03:19.567 --> 03:21.735
public liaison
to Belle Chasse.

03:21.769 --> 03:22.903
He live alone?

03:22.936 --> 03:24.738
His wife Rachel's in Pensacola.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.274
Vacation?
Not sure.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.542
CACO's making
the notification right now.

03:28.576 --> 03:29.777
I'm checking outside.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.979
Morning, Loretta.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.947
It's not a particularly good one
for Captain Grant.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.649
Cause of death
appears to be

03:35.683 --> 03:37.017
three gunshot wounds
to the chest.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.286
The captain was also

03:38.319 --> 03:39.920
on the receiving end
of a beating.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.289
Contusions to the head.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.825
Significant bruising
to his body.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.862
Any witnesses?
Next-door
neighbor's place

03:48.896 --> 03:50.831
is vacant, and the rest
of the neighbors were working.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.000
PRIDE:
Who called 911?

03:53.033 --> 03:55.703
Radio deejay Kayla Anderson
at Hot NOLA FM.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.970
She was on live
with him

03:57.004 --> 03:58.672
when he was killed--
she made the call

03:58.706 --> 03:59.840
along with most
of her listeners.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.642
Check it out, King.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.877
NOPD found it outside
in the bushes

04:03.911 --> 04:06.847
next to Captain Grant's
bedroom window.
Nine

04:06.880 --> 04:08.716
Yep.
That could be
our murder weapon.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.983
Yeah. Get it to Sebastian.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.753
I'll go chat with our deejay.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.723
KAYLA:
I heard those gunshots,

04:15.756 --> 04:17.658
and the line went dead.
I just...

04:17.691 --> 04:20.594
I called 911 right away.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.029
You knew Captain Grant?

04:22.062 --> 04:25.032
We served together in Iraq,
two tours.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.900
He was your commanding officer?

04:26.934 --> 04:29.036
And my friend.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.874
Do you have any idea why he
called your show this morning?

04:33.907 --> 04:37.378
He was making a donation
to a charity that I run.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.780
Did you hear anything
besides the shots?

04:39.813 --> 04:41.749
Voices, maybe, or...?
Sorry to interrupt, Kayla.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.784
Uh, this is Tyson Reed.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.319
Helps me run Youth Stripes,
my nonprofit.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.887
I'm working the phone bank.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.689
There's a call that you
both need to take.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.760
Guy called a few minutes ago,
said he had info

04:52.793 --> 04:55.729
on Captain Grant's murder,
will only talk to Kayla.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.631
Hello?
:
Is this Kayla?

04:57.665 --> 05:00.901
Yes. You have information
on Captain Grant?

05:00.934 --> 05:02.970
I do. And you better watch
your back, Kayla,

05:03.003 --> 05:04.972
because you're next.

05:18.586 --> 05:19.453
Captain Jim Grant,

05:19.487 --> 05:21.555
public affairs officer
out of Belle Chasse,

05:21.589 --> 05:23.391
is beaten and shot to death
by an intruder,

05:23.424 --> 05:26.427
all the while live on air
with deejay Kayla Anderson.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.363
A few hours later,
Kayla receives a call

05:29.397 --> 05:30.631
that she's next.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.666
No luck tracing
the call.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.437
Grant and Kayla served
in Iraq together.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.905
What else connects them?

05:37.938 --> 05:39.840
Well, Grant was calling in
to make a donation

05:39.873 --> 05:42.776
to Kayla's charity.
According to financials,

05:42.810 --> 05:46.414
$200,000 was wired
from his bank account

05:46.447 --> 05:47.515
to the Youth Stripes.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.983
That's a lot of dough
for a career naval officer.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.786
Well, his wife Rachel is on
her way in now from Pensacola.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.422
Hopefully,
she can shed some light.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.590
I'll sit back down
with Kayla.

05:58.826 --> 06:02.396
You're gonna wear out
the terra cotta.

06:02.430 --> 06:05.799
Patton Plame?
You got to be kidding me!

06:05.833 --> 06:07.968
As handsome and as
dashing as ever.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.671
If you don't say so
yourself.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.573
You're a federal agent?

06:12.606 --> 06:15.709
Well, I like to think of it
more like... superhero.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.812
When NCIS needs me,
I swoop in to save the day.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.548
So... Batman.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.683
Yeah. You said it;
I'm just living it.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.686
I'm gonna deduce

06:25.719 --> 06:27.688
that the two of you
know each other.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.023
We go way back.
Yeah.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.626
My dangerous days.
Yeah, well,

06:32.660 --> 06:34.628
these days seem
pretty dangerous, too.

06:34.662 --> 06:35.729
That phone call?

06:35.763 --> 06:37.431
Coffee?

06:37.465 --> 06:39.500
I'm a deejay.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.502
People hear my voice every day.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.437
It's an intimate relationship.

06:43.471 --> 06:46.474
Some fans take it too far--
weird phone calls, e-mails.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.477
It's more than a
random occurrence, Kayla.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.446
This caller knew about
Captain Grant's murder.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.915
PATTON: Any of your
creepier correspondence

06:54.948 --> 06:56.550
stand out recently?

06:56.584 --> 06:59.853
Some guy came by
the station last week,

06:59.887 --> 07:02.623
said that he had to talk to me,

07:02.656 --> 07:04.658
that it was
life and death.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.894
Security escorted him out.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.963
I'm gonna request surveillance
footage from the station.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.799
Yeah. Good idea.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.635
Something else.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.738
The donation Grant
was making to your charity.

07:17.771 --> 07:21.008
Money was transferred
to Youth Stripes yesterday.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.043
$200,000.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.945
What?

07:24.978 --> 07:26.547
Uh...
You didn't know

07:26.580 --> 07:29.483
it was gonna be that...
generous?

07:29.517 --> 07:32.986
Tyson Reed handles the
financials for Youth Stripes.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.489
I had no idea.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.124
Well, given everything
that's gone on today,

07:37.157 --> 07:40.961
I think maybe... we should
have NOPD escort you.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.129
Is that necessary?

07:42.162 --> 07:43.096
I'd say so.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.198
We need to keep you safe.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.503
The whole drive
from Florida...

07:49.537 --> 07:51.605
I just, I kept expecting
Jim to call

07:51.639 --> 07:53.674
and say that it was
just a misunderstanding

07:53.707 --> 07:56.043
and he was fine.
May I ask why

07:56.076 --> 07:58.679
your husband lived here

07:58.712 --> 08:00.113
when you're
in Pensacola?

08:00.147 --> 08:03.016
Jim was 90 days from retirement.

08:03.050 --> 08:07.521
After years of deployments
and all the posts and...

08:07.555 --> 08:08.956
we're finally
settling down,

08:08.989 --> 08:10.524
I was getting our
new home ready.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.660
You just bought a house?

08:12.693 --> 08:15.295
Put every penny
we had into it.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.697
Are you aware
your husband

08:16.730 --> 08:19.032
made a very large donation

08:19.066 --> 08:21.134
to Youth Stripes before he died?

08:21.168 --> 08:24.071
I don't know what you think
my husband was into, but...

08:24.104 --> 08:26.974
that money was an inheritance.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.576
His father died
a few months ago.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.977
And he decided
to donate

08:30.010 --> 08:31.211
all the money
to Kayla's charity?

08:31.244 --> 08:32.546
We decided.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.047
His father was a bastard.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.549
Jim didn't want his money.

08:35.583 --> 08:39.252
My husband was
an honorable man,

08:39.286 --> 08:41.288
to a fault.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.558
I... I just can't imagine

08:44.592 --> 08:47.561
that anyone would
want to kill him.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.797
*

08:51.364 --> 08:52.566
Talk to me.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.134
Yeah, hey, I got a hit

08:54.167 --> 08:57.270
off the radio station's
surveillance cameras.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.973
This is the guy who tried
to get in to see Kayla?
Yeah.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.175
He ran off
before NOPD could arrive.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.977
And that's not the only
time he showed up.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.145
And here's the money shot.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.648
PRIDE:
Winner is...

09:08.649 --> 09:10.718
Brandon Pierce.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.620
Ex-Delta Force.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.588
Knows his way around firearms.
Yep.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.758
Discharged after he took some
shrapnel to the head in Iraq.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.760
Yeah, he frequents
a boarding house on the Westbank

09:19.793 --> 09:22.329
called the Duke
and the Dauphin.
I know that.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.064
Lasalle and Brody's
looking into it.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.132
All right, good work, P.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.234
Yeah.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.743
"Things to Shout
Out Loud at Parties."

09:35.776 --> 09:37.077
Enlightening?

09:37.110 --> 09:38.178
It's pretty good.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.146
Yeah?

09:39.179 --> 09:40.614
I got you some coffee.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.016
Thank you.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.653
You know, I'm, uh,
I'm waiting on autopsy results.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.788
You, uh--
got a couple of minutes--

09:47.821 --> 09:50.157
you want to talk now?
Not sure this is

09:50.190 --> 09:52.025
a few minutes kind
of conversation, Dad.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.694
Okay. Um...

09:53.727 --> 09:56.029
ride with me to Loretta's.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.397
All right?
Give me a preview.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.035
You're busy with a case.

10:02.069 --> 10:05.038
Maybe... I-I'll just head out.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.740
Back to Baton Rouge?

10:06.774 --> 10:08.375
No.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.778
Stay for dinner, okay?

10:10.811 --> 10:12.646
We'll get into it,
and you can go back

10:12.680 --> 10:14.114
in the morning to school.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.050
No.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.652
I'm not going back to school.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.257
This is about midterm recital?

10:24.291 --> 10:26.426
'Cause you
always do great.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.762
It's about a lot of things.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.331
Okay. Hey, I'm listening.

10:31.364 --> 10:34.334
Well, it's kind of a long story,
and it's not gonna fit

10:34.367 --> 10:36.103
between a call and a text.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.371
And... another call.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.342
Go ahead already--
it's your job.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.344
Text me about tonight.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.686
WADE:
Dropping out of school--

10:52.720 --> 10:54.121
that's not like Laurel.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.823
I've been racking
my brain.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.324
Is it... workload?

10:57.357 --> 10:59.827
Problems with
the boyfriend?

10:59.860 --> 11:01.862
You know, anything
like that...

11:01.895 --> 11:04.832
Agent Dwayne Pride
would have surely picked up on.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.299
Well, always have in the past.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.801
Your work,

11:07.835 --> 11:09.202
the bar...

11:09.236 --> 11:11.404
your daughter...

11:11.438 --> 11:14.174
Not to mention
the bounty on your head.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.243
I'm not gonna make excuses.
Maybe I haven't been there

11:16.276 --> 11:17.711
for her like I want.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.713
You have always been there
for Laurel.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.215
Look, it's not easy

11:22.249 --> 11:25.318
to stay on top of everything--
as I'm finding with the boys.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.721
I'm lucky if I get
two words and a grunt

11:27.755 --> 11:28.922
out of them to figure out

11:28.956 --> 11:31.258
what went wrong sometimes.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.793
And girls are
a little more complicated.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.427
Yeah, don't I know it.
Just...

11:34.461 --> 11:37.898
stay out of your own way,
hear what's on her mind,

11:37.931 --> 11:40.734
and maybe you'll figure out
what she really means.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.271
Awful wise for a new parent.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.239
Mm.

11:46.273 --> 11:49.142
As for Captain Grant...
I've confirmed

11:49.176 --> 11:51.912
C.O.D. from multiple
gunshot wounds.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.480
After taking a beating?

11:53.513 --> 11:55.182
Well, yes and no.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.384
Captain Grant was beaten--

11:57.417 --> 11:59.419
but after he was killed.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.790
When someone suffers injuries
from a beating,

12:02.823 --> 12:05.258
there's swelling and damage
to the epithelium,

12:05.292 --> 12:07.227
blood rushes
to the tissues,

12:07.260 --> 12:08.962
changes the color
of the skin.

12:08.996 --> 12:12.165
But... if the victim
is already dead,

12:12.199 --> 12:14.234
the blood's no longer rushing.

12:14.267 --> 12:18.205
Then the suspect isn't
just a random intruder.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.940
He inflicted the wounds,
ransacked the house

12:19.973 --> 12:22.810
to make it look like
the captain put up a fight.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.778
Oh, like Gone Girl.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.246
The movie?

12:26.279 --> 12:27.480
I actually prefer the book.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.216
It is not for the faint
of heart, though.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.918
Makes relationships
look pretty scary.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.519
It's probably why I'm single,
if you really want

12:32.552 --> 12:33.787
to break it down.
Why don't we

12:33.821 --> 12:35.823
save it for the book club, dear.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.457
Right. Sorry.
Okay, so I can confirm

12:37.490 --> 12:39.960
that the gun found at the scene
was the murder weapon.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.328
No match in IBIS,
but I found

12:41.361 --> 12:42.562
a print on the inside

12:42.595 --> 12:43.997
of the weapon's magazine.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.298
I'm running it now;
no hits yet.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.834
Keep me posted.
Will do.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.802
Oh, and if either of you
want in on that book club,

12:48.836 --> 12:49.970
I'm totally down.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.242
BOLO's out on Brandon Pierce.
Nothing yet.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.810
Yeah, waste of resources.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.345
Seeing as Triple P
already got a line on them.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.546
When you speak in third person,

12:59.579 --> 13:01.281
that means
you're onto something.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.216
Yeah. Figured out that
Pierce's cell phone was used

13:03.250 --> 13:05.218
to call in the threat
to Kayla this morning.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.220
Can you trace it?
Eh, bad news.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.989
The phone is powered down.

13:09.022 --> 13:12.225
But the good news is I could
power it back up remotely.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.527
'Cause I am Batman!

13:14.561 --> 13:16.563
So, you and Kayla Anderson.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.231
Yeah, old friends.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.867
Friends friends,
or friends with benefits?

13:19.900 --> 13:22.235
Because Pride said you guys
were looking pretty cozy.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.371
D-Man has never used the word
"cozy" a day in his life.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.239
That's not a denial.
Look, you want

13:26.273 --> 13:28.308
to gossip, or do you want
to find a suspected murderer?

13:28.341 --> 13:30.377
Suspected murderer.
Thank you.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.414
All right, I got
his phone back up.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.851
Accessing his GPS.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.988
He's in the Tremé.
Broad and Dumaine.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.555
That's five minutes
away from Kayla.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.924
He's going after her.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.059
I'll call Pride.

13:46.093 --> 13:49.496
*

13:49.529 --> 13:51.865
Back gate.

13:51.899 --> 13:52.933
Brody.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.068
KAYLA:
Get back!

13:56.369 --> 13:58.005
Shh...
Pierce! NCIS!

13:58.038 --> 13:59.272
Stay away from her!
Back off! Back off!

13:59.306 --> 14:00.440
Easy, easy. Pierce!
Put the weapon down.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.474
Stay away!
Get your hands up.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.876
Kayla, stay behind me!

14:02.910 --> 14:04.077
Put the weapon down.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.545
Easy, Pierce.
Pierce, listen to me.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.481
I will shoot you.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.482
You need to drop it.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.323
On your knees.
Cross your ankles.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.325
You have to let me
talk to Kayla. Please.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.293
Kayla, you're not safe.
Her life is in danger.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.029
You have to listen
to me right now.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.563
Kayla! You're in danger!

14:31.671 --> 14:33.907
Ma'am, I need to talk to Kayla.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.442
You need to talk
to me, Brandon.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.910
You don't understand.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.211
I do.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.580
It's a matter of life and death.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.049
That's what you told
the security guard

14:42.082 --> 14:43.150
at the radio station.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.484
Are you making fun of me?

14:44.517 --> 14:48.521
I promise I am taking you
very seriously.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.291
We found these in your place.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.494
Kayla is my friend.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.229
Kayla doesn't know you, Brandon.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.231
She'd never seen you
before today.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.000
How could you be connected?

15:00.033 --> 15:02.569
I can't tell you,
but will you listen to me?

15:02.602 --> 15:04.237
She's in danger.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.473
That's why I called
the radio station.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.608
To warn her somebody's
been following her.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.477
That would be you.
No.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.479
Somebody else.
I was there to protect her.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.346
What about Captain Grant?

15:13.380 --> 15:16.516
You trying to protect him,
too, Brandon?

15:16.549 --> 15:19.519
But I swear I didn't do it.

15:19.552 --> 15:23.056
I could never,
ever hurt this man.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.958
We served in Iraq together.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.659
He's like a brother to me.

15:29.329 --> 15:33.300
Captain Grant ran
a radio station in Baghdad.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.235
You were Delta Force
in Ramadi.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.237
You didn't serve together.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.272
You don't know.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.311
But you can't.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.983
*

15:50.017 --> 15:53.253
Fine.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.522
Sonic Boom.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.291
We were all part
of it, okay?

15:58.325 --> 16:01.694
You have created a relationship
that doesn't exist.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.730
You're presenting
paranoid delusions.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.632
Why should I believe
a word you say?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.667
Because it's the truth.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.270
PRIDE:
What do you think?

16:10.303 --> 16:13.073
Brandon suffers from
obsessive personality disorder,

16:13.106 --> 16:15.275
possibly paranoid
schizophrenia.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.610
In other words,
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.746
Not exactly the clinical term.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.181
Well, whatever
term you use

16:21.214 --> 16:23.050
doesn't make him sound
any less guilty.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.185
It's likely
he killed Captain Grant,

16:25.218 --> 16:28.121
was planning
on killing Kayla, too.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.357
I have my doubts.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.292
You caught Brandon
two seconds away

16:32.325 --> 16:34.594
from splaying Kayla alive.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.563
Where's the doubt in that?

16:36.596 --> 16:39.132
I don't know.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.335
Something is just...
is not right.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.304
We got a maniac
with a knife in custody.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.139
My girl Kayla's safe and sound.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.108
I say everything
is A-Okay.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.678
Just friends, he says.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.613
LASALLE:
So, I forwarded Brandon's prints

16:53.646 --> 16:55.115
to Sebastian,
guessing they'll match

16:55.148 --> 16:56.716
the one he pulled
off the murder weapon,

16:56.749 --> 16:58.185
and we can close this up.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.587
Until then, have him sit tight.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.090
I got
an important dinner date.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.058
Lasalle, you still
on good terms

17:05.092 --> 17:06.793
with your friend
from Naval Intelligence?

17:06.826 --> 17:10.330
Gloria? Yeah, she still answers
my phone calls. Why?

17:10.363 --> 17:13.200
Okay, Brandon mentioned this
top secret operation in Iraq

17:13.233 --> 17:14.667
called Sonic Boom.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.803
Well, it sounds like crazy talk.
Maybe.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.338
But would you
look into it for me?

17:18.371 --> 17:19.806
You got it.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.348
*

17:28.381 --> 17:31.318
All I've done
my whole life is piano.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.353
Practice, recital,
more practice.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.389
Total focus, and never knowing
if I'm actually good enough.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.825
You're the best damn musician
at that school.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.094
Says my father.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.729
And even if that
were the case,

17:42.762 --> 17:44.231
what does that even mean?

17:44.264 --> 17:47.167
Am I gonna do this
from now until... I die?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.202
Sacrifice all my time
in front of a piano?

17:49.236 --> 17:52.372
Time with my friends,
my family?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.374
You know,
sometimes I wonder

17:54.407 --> 17:55.875
what our lives
might have been like

17:55.908 --> 17:57.277
if you'd been...

17:57.310 --> 17:59.412
a car salesman or something?

17:59.446 --> 18:01.214
:
A wh...? A car salesman!

18:03.250 --> 18:05.885
Look, music's what you love.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.256
No, Dad. Music is
what you love.

18:09.289 --> 18:13.126
It's just... what I do.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.728
And what you do
is important.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.265
It's your calling.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.401
I'm just... looking for mine.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.440
Cue the man's calling.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.445
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.
I'm not sure

18:32.479 --> 18:33.880
I was making
much progress anyway.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.415
Talk to me
about Brandon Pierce.
Okay.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.150
Ran his fingerprints
against the ones found

18:37.184 --> 18:38.818
on the weapon
that killed Captain Grant.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.687
Not a match.
Not a match?

18:40.720 --> 18:43.423
Not only that. Lasalle checked
with Naval Intelligence--

18:43.456 --> 18:45.858
Sonic Boom was real.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.164
BRANDON: So you don't think
I'm crazy anymore?

18:51.198 --> 18:53.500
Let's stay on topic.
Sonic Boom.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.302
A series
of surgical bomb strikes

18:55.335 --> 18:56.836
on militants in Ramadi.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.271
What was your part?

18:58.305 --> 19:00.707
I was in hostile territory
doing recon

19:00.740 --> 19:04.711
on enemy activity,
damage reports after strikes.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.846
I understand Delta Force
being there.

19:06.879 --> 19:10.950
But a U.S. Military Radio
producer and deejay?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.719
The enemy wasn't isolated.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.755
These cowards lived
among the population,

19:15.788 --> 19:17.957
so we needed to warn
the friendlies

19:17.990 --> 19:20.327
when the next strike
was imminent,

19:20.360 --> 19:23.330
and it wasn't exactly like
we could go door to door.

19:23.363 --> 19:26.199
But you could get a message
to them over the airwaves.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.268
Correct.
Encoded, of course.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.737
But we could tell them
exactly when and where

19:30.770 --> 19:34.807
the next strike would be,
and it saved a lot of lives.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.409
Including mine.

19:36.443 --> 19:37.477
Tell us how.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.280
I was always at ground zero

19:40.313 --> 19:42.882
when the bombs dropped.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.752
And if I didn't get blown up,

19:45.785 --> 19:47.320
I was pretty damn sure

19:47.354 --> 19:48.988
I was gonna get picked off
by a sniper,

19:49.021 --> 19:51.258
or, even worse, captured.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.527
But Kayla was
always there with me.

19:54.561 --> 19:58.998
She was the calm voice
inside my head.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.501
She's about the only thing
that keeps me calm

20:01.534 --> 20:03.836
these days, and...

20:03.870 --> 20:06.906
I just wanted
to be close to her.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.375
So you came to New Orleans.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.777
Yeah.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.213
I finally got to put
a face to the voice.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.917
But I wasn't the only one

20:17.950 --> 20:19.919
that was keeping tabs on her.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.921
For the past few weeks,

20:21.954 --> 20:24.424
whenever Kayla left
the radio station,

20:24.457 --> 20:25.892
some car was following.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.327
You get a description?

20:27.360 --> 20:28.027
License plate?

20:28.060 --> 20:29.362
Yes.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.464
It-it was a green car...

20:31.498 --> 20:33.400
with, uh...

20:33.433 --> 20:35.268
had a busted taillight,

20:35.302 --> 20:38.438
Louisiana plates:

20:38.471 --> 20:40.473
K...

20:40.507 --> 20:42.041
I think maybe it was a seven.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.911
Um, no, it was...
maybe it was a four.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.979
I don't know.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.551
I get numbers mixed up.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.453
It's okay, Brandon.
Take your time.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.522
Mystery green car,
busted taillight--

20:55.555 --> 20:57.290
it's kind of hard
to believe, Brandon.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.959
Have I lied to you
about anything else?

20:59.992 --> 21:02.429
Why do you think
this was about Sonic Boom?

21:02.462 --> 21:05.432
'Cause it wasn't just Kayla
they were following.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.534
It was also
Captain Grant.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.369
BRODY: Brandon,
how can one car

21:09.402 --> 21:12.439
follow two people
simultaneously?

21:12.472 --> 21:14.641
When they were together.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.976
Which was a lot.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.648
KAYLA:
You think Iraqi insurgents

21:21.681 --> 21:23.850
came to New Orleans
to get revenge

21:23.883 --> 21:26.453
for classified
radio broadcasts?
I'm thinking Brandon

21:26.486 --> 21:28.555
saw someone in a green car

21:28.588 --> 21:31.958
following you
and Captain Grant.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.561
That's news to me.
Well...

21:34.594 --> 21:36.529
I'm just trying to understand

21:36.563 --> 21:38.598
your relationship
with Captain Grant.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.032
We were friends.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.468
And he was picking you up

21:41.501 --> 21:43.636
at the station
three times a week?

21:43.670 --> 21:45.638
We were good friends.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.007
Only two people
at U.S. Military Radio

21:48.040 --> 21:50.443
that knew about Sonic Boom.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.579
Sworn to secrecy
to this day.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.047
Bonded us.
And that bond
stayed strong?

21:55.081 --> 21:56.683
When he got assigned
to Belle Chasse,

21:56.716 --> 21:58.017
we reconnected.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.886
I told him
about Youth Stripes.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.354
He wanted to help.

22:01.388 --> 22:03.523
So we'd see
each other regularly.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.692
That's the whole story.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.895
Look, I don't know
what else to tell you.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.030
You can think what
you want to think, but...

22:11.063 --> 22:12.565
I got 20 minutes till air,

22:12.599 --> 22:14.667
and I got to talk to Tyson
about fund-raising.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.506
Kayla!

22:51.438 --> 22:53.406
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.475
NOFD finished
their initial assessment.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.944
No deaths and no suspicious
activity on surveillance.

22:57.977 --> 23:01.414
So whoever did this knew
the lay of the land.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.716
Yeah, and there's a couple
of people unaccounted for,

23:03.750 --> 23:05.585
including Tyson Reed.

23:05.618 --> 23:06.953
Youth Stripes
financial director?

23:06.986 --> 23:08.955
Yeah, Brody's trying
to track him down now.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.458
Fire investigators
did confirm it was arson.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.693
Point of origin?
Kayla's office.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.563
Flames hit the gas line,
set off the explosion.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.798
Sebastian-- he's in there now
doing his thing.

23:18.831 --> 23:19.966
Brandon Pierce
is still in custody,

23:19.999 --> 23:21.634
so he's not responsible.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.770
Kayla tell you anything more
about her relationship

23:23.803 --> 23:25.938
with Captain Grant?
Nothing satisfying.

23:25.972 --> 23:29.742
Think she's hiding something?
I think someone wants
her and Grant dead.

23:29.776 --> 23:32.479
We're no closer
to figuring out who.

23:32.512 --> 23:35.482
Find out if Sebastian
knows anything.

23:38.818 --> 23:42.455
:
Okay, so, your arsonist

23:42.489 --> 23:44.457
was no kind of
a criminal mastermind.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.459
He took all this accelerant
and spread it...
Sebastian?

23:46.493 --> 23:48.595
I can't understand
what you're saying.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.931
: I said...

23:51.964 --> 23:54.701
I said that your arsonist was
no kind of criminal mastermind.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.803
In fact, I was able to deter...

23:56.836 --> 23:59.472
Bless you.
Thank you. Sorry.

23:59.506 --> 24:01.474
I was able to determine

24:01.508 --> 24:04.544
that the accelerator used
was C12-H23.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.779
It's just your standard
diesel fuel.
Oh.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.549
Available at most gas stations
in town. What about the fuse?

24:09.582 --> 24:10.850
Ye old Zippo lighter.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.752
Wonder if this
is actually covered

24:12.785 --> 24:14.821
under its lifetime guarantee.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.989
So the suspect pours diesel
all over Kayla's office,

24:17.023 --> 24:19.826
lights it up and hopes
she gets caught in the blast

24:19.859 --> 24:21.561
when the gas line ignites?

24:21.594 --> 24:23.696
Well, that's where things get
a little interesting.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.031
You see this burn pattern
along here?

24:25.064 --> 24:27.634
This is where the fire bug
poured the accelerant.

24:27.667 --> 24:31.504
Well, why ignite a desk
when a chair is more flammable?

24:31.538 --> 24:33.540
Well, 'cause it wasn't the desk
that he was after.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.041
The splash marks
from the accelerant suggest

24:35.074 --> 24:37.544
that it was the computer
on the desk.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.546
So this wasn't
about killing Kayla?

24:39.579 --> 24:42.549
Not homicide. Compu-cide.

24:45.552 --> 24:47.720
The only difference
between this computer

24:47.754 --> 24:50.089
and one of those nasty zombies
on The Walkin Dead

24:50.122 --> 24:52.659
is this thing is
actually deceased.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.827
Well, can't you
recover the data,

24:54.861 --> 24:57.797
or-or clone
the hard drive, or...?

24:57.830 --> 24:59.932
Even Triple P
can't resurrect the dead.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.535
But I'm not gonna
let that stop me. I'm gonna

25:02.569 --> 25:04.136
go back through the files
on Captain Grant's computer

25:04.170 --> 25:05.805
and see if
there's anything of interest.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.540
Tyson Reed is officially
in the wind.

25:07.574 --> 25:08.808
The guy who helps Kayla

25:08.841 --> 25:10.643
with the Youth Stripes
financials?

25:10.677 --> 25:12.779
He's gone?
Not at home,
not answering his cell.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.013
Had access to the station,

25:14.046 --> 25:16.816
and he's the only one still
unaccounted for after the fire.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.050
Well, I don't know
about finding

25:18.084 --> 25:19.819
this Tyson Reed dude,
but I think

25:19.852 --> 25:21.621
I may have found something

25:21.654 --> 25:23.556
on the captain's computer.

25:23.590 --> 25:26.593
It's a receipt from
a forensic accounting firm.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.695
Why would Captain Grant
hire forensic accountants?

25:28.728 --> 25:30.763
I know someone we can ask.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.098
RACHEL:
Thank you

25:32.131 --> 25:34.033
for letting me do this.

25:34.066 --> 25:37.837
I just want to gather a few
things for Jim's memorial.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.572
Anything to help.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.974
Actually, we were hoping
you could help us, too.

25:42.008 --> 25:44.076
We found an invoice from

25:44.110 --> 25:46.112
a forensic accountant
on your husband's hard drive.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.648
Are you aware of that?

25:49.949 --> 25:51.951
Uh, Jim hired him
a few days ago

25:51.984 --> 25:54.153
to audit Youth Stripes.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.823
Was he worried something
was wrong with the charity?

25:56.856 --> 25:58.991
Well, if you donate $200,000,

25:59.025 --> 26:01.127
you want to be sure
it's being used properly.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.663
Jim was thorough that way.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.732
Audit flag any discrepancies?

26:05.765 --> 26:08.835
I don't know.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.937
You willing
to give us permission

26:10.970 --> 26:12.605
to look at the report?

26:13.940 --> 26:16.743
Yeah, sure,
anything you need.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.211
Your husband
and Kayla were close?

26:19.245 --> 26:20.847
War buddies.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.815
A special bond, right?

26:25.785 --> 26:28.120
You're suggesting that they were
romantically involved?

26:30.056 --> 26:32.759
Marriages can be complicated.

26:32.792 --> 26:36.763
Yeah, maybe so,
but my husband was not.

26:36.796 --> 26:40.066
He was the most loyal man
that I've ever known.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.968
If you don't mind,

26:42.001 --> 26:44.804
I need to get Jim's dress blues
for his casket.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.042
Hey, Pride.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.178
I was looking at the audit

26:52.211 --> 26:56.816
forensic accountants prepared
on Youth Stripes.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.885
There were some questionable
transfers of cash.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.653
Questionable

27:00.687 --> 27:03.990
as in bad bookkeeping,
or questionable like fraud?

27:04.023 --> 27:07.126
Fraud.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.261
Last few weeks.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.030
Small amounts at first.

27:11.063 --> 27:14.934
A few thousand here and there,
and then, yesterday,

27:14.967 --> 27:17.003
after Captain Grant was killed,

27:17.036 --> 27:20.072
the entire account
was cleaned out.

27:20.106 --> 27:21.808
A million dollars.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.209
You think Tyson Reed stole it?

27:23.242 --> 27:26.713
It was Kayla's pin code
that was used

27:26.746 --> 27:27.980
to clear it out.

27:28.014 --> 27:30.216
Not possible, man.
Well,

27:30.249 --> 27:33.119
I know
she's your friend, Patton.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.887
Whether she's my friend or not.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.856
You're accusing her
of theft.
No, no.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.091
I'm just following the evidence.
The evidence is

27:39.125 --> 27:40.760
Tyson Reed going underground

27:40.793 --> 27:42.261
after possibly shooting
Captain Grant

27:42.294 --> 27:44.697
and trying to burn down
the radio station.

27:44.731 --> 27:46.198
And we're looking for him.

27:46.232 --> 27:49.135
But it's possible that he
and Kayla are working together.

27:49.168 --> 27:52.805
I know this woman, Pride.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.708
She leave socks
on the floor? Yes.

27:55.742 --> 27:58.711
She cheat on Sunday crosswords?
Regularly.

27:58.745 --> 28:01.914
But she would never steal money
from her own charity.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.315
And she damn sure
wasn't involved

28:03.349 --> 28:05.017
in trying to kill anyone.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.720
Patton, you're too close.
Come on!

28:07.754 --> 28:09.856
You got to admit there are
a lot of unanswered questions.

28:09.889 --> 28:12.759
We need to check Kayla out.
That's just what we do.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.829
We need to look
into her personal computer.

28:16.863 --> 28:19.265
No, we don't.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.901
'Cause I already did.

28:25.805 --> 28:29.776
I found some e-mails
that Captain Grant sent to Kayla

28:29.809 --> 28:31.110
that seemed kind of hinky.

28:31.143 --> 28:33.245
There was an argument
that they were having,

28:33.279 --> 28:35.882
but it was
only his side,

28:35.915 --> 28:38.818
so I went ahead and hacked
her e-mails.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.820
You find something?
Yeah.

28:40.853 --> 28:43.189
But not what you think.

28:46.826 --> 28:50.062
These are love letters, Kayla.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.164
They go back
a lot of years.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.300
Until right after
you left the Navy.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.202
When we knew each other.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.805
I know what they are.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.339
I wrote half of them.

29:00.372 --> 29:03.776
You and Captain Grant
were having an affair.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.044
Not technically.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.146
What does that mean?

29:07.179 --> 29:09.115
It means we never acted on it.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.382
We just talked about it.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.785
Jim was married,

29:12.819 --> 29:14.787
and neither one of us wanted to
start a relationship with a lie.

29:14.821 --> 29:16.255
According

29:16.288 --> 29:18.891
to the e-mails, you two were
planning a life together.

29:18.925 --> 29:21.227
But only
after Jim got a divorce.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.932
You know, I can't believe
you hacked me.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.134
Because I was trying
to clear you of embezzlement.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.336
What are you talking about?

29:30.369 --> 29:33.940
Someone's been emptying
the Youth Stripes account.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.207
We think
that Jim found out.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.043
And we think
that's why he was killed.

29:37.076 --> 29:39.245
Well, talk to Tyson Reed.
He handles our accounts.

29:39.278 --> 29:42.081
Tyson's missing, Kayla.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.885
Missing?

29:48.187 --> 29:50.923
Jim and I were supposed
to get a fresh start,

29:50.957 --> 29:53.225
do things right.

29:54.994 --> 29:56.996
He was gonna leave Rachel

29:57.029 --> 29:59.298
and come work with me
at Youth Stripes.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.972
A whole new life.

30:07.373 --> 30:10.376
Now it's gone.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.081
King, we got
something.

30:26.392 --> 30:28.928
Pulled Tyson Reed's
credit card charges.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.362
He used the Youth Stripes card

30:30.396 --> 30:32.098
to purchase
a five-gallon gas can

30:32.131 --> 30:33.966
at a hardware store
two days ago.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.136
And five gallons of diesel
from a gas station yesterday.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.438
Enough to start the fire
at the radio station.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.140
That same card was used

30:41.173 --> 30:42.441
to book a room
at the Bridgeview Motel.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.043
Room 104.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.344
He's not exactly
the criminal mastermind,

30:45.377 --> 30:47.279
so he could still
be at the motel.

30:47.313 --> 30:50.382
Chris, you're with me.

30:50.416 --> 30:54.486
Brody, tell Laurel
I'll be back as soon as I can.

30:59.025 --> 31:01.160
King!

31:01.193 --> 31:03.462
Oh, God.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.267
Thanks.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.203
Distracted.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.373
Case or other stuff?

31:14.406 --> 31:17.043
Uh, it's something
Laurel said.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.945
About her wanting
to take time off school?

31:18.978 --> 31:21.513
You think I pushed her
into music?

31:21.547 --> 31:24.984
Well, I think music's
sort of in the Pride blood.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.953
Why, is that what
Laurel thinks?

31:26.986 --> 31:28.921
I honestly can't tell.

31:28.955 --> 31:30.456
All I know right now is

31:30.489 --> 31:33.059
she used to wish
that I was a car salesman.

31:35.027 --> 31:37.396
Two things
I've been sure of my whole life.

31:37.429 --> 31:40.266
I know my job,
and I know my daughter.

31:42.268 --> 31:45.171
Right now, I'm not so sure
about the second one.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.940
Well, my dad made
it clear to me

31:47.974 --> 31:50.042
I was meant
for the oil business,

31:50.076 --> 31:51.177
just like him.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.045
Hmm.
He reminded me

31:53.079 --> 31:56.482
every day where I belonged
as his son.

31:56.515 --> 32:00.419
All right, but he
didn't know me one bit.

32:00.452 --> 32:03.355
All right,
that's not like you, King.

32:03.389 --> 32:05.124
You're in the clear.

32:21.007 --> 32:24.376
Green car, broken tail light,
just like Brandon Pierce said.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.178
Yeah, room 104.

32:26.212 --> 32:28.414
Cold.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.422
Tyson Reed,
federal agents!

32:36.455 --> 32:39.291
Gonna need you to open up,
answer some questions.

32:54.106 --> 32:57.409
Looks like our pal opted out of
answering questions for good.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.227
The blood in the eyes is
brought about by hemorrhaging

33:15.261 --> 33:18.730
due to high levels of carbon
dioxide in the blood stream.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.667
Tyson Reed's cause
of death was suffocation.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.470
I also found these contusions
around his neck.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.338
From the bag taped
over his head?

33:26.372 --> 33:28.174
Well, that's what I
thought initially,

33:28.207 --> 33:31.410
but you see these
tiny spots of blood?

33:31.443 --> 33:34.213
They're from burst
superficial blood vessels.

33:34.246 --> 33:37.216
Caused by someone suckling
on his skin.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.085
LASALLE:
So you're saying Reed

33:39.118 --> 33:40.752
had a hickey?

33:40.786 --> 33:42.821
Well, there are a variety
of medical terms for it,

33:42.854 --> 33:45.091
but, uh, yes, a hickey.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.126
Based on color,

33:47.159 --> 33:50.529
I'd say it was inflicted
within a few hours of his death.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.764
Reed had company
before his final exit.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.233
SEBASTIAN:
Well, about that

33:54.266 --> 33:56.235
fine farewell--
I, uh, ran the print

33:56.268 --> 33:57.503
from the gun that killed
Captain Grant

33:57.536 --> 33:59.271
against Tyson Reed,

33:59.305 --> 34:01.773
and it rendered
a perfect match.

34:01.807 --> 34:05.511
So Grant figured out Reed was
stealing from Youth Stripes.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.846
Reed murdered Grant

34:07.879 --> 34:09.548
before he could
expose him,

34:09.581 --> 34:13.385
burned Kayla's computer
to cover his tracks,

34:13.419 --> 34:15.854
and then kills himself.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.290
Well, at least that's what
someone wants us to think.

34:18.324 --> 34:21.093
See, at Captain Grant's
crime scene, there wasn't

34:21.127 --> 34:23.329
a single trace
of forensic anything

34:23.362 --> 34:24.863
except for one
impeccable fingerprint

34:24.896 --> 34:26.432
all wrapped up in a bow.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.600
That's...
that's really weird, okay?

34:28.634 --> 34:31.237
So I took a closer look
at Reed's tox screen...

34:31.270 --> 34:33.872
and found this.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.542
Guy had benzodiazepine
in his system.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.477
That makes sense.
If you're about to off yourself,

34:38.510 --> 34:40.512
you might want some kind
of anxiety relief,

34:40.546 --> 34:42.514
but his dose,
it's off the chart.

34:42.548 --> 34:44.883
Levels that high,
Reed would have been

34:44.916 --> 34:47.453
too impaired
to tape a bag over his head.

34:47.486 --> 34:49.355
He'd barely be able
to stand up.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.190
SEBASTIAN:
Which means we've

34:51.223 --> 34:52.558
officially moved
from weird evidence

34:52.591 --> 34:55.327
to staged suicide.

34:55.361 --> 34:59.165
So someone had to get close
enough to Reed to drug him.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.500
Someone he trusted.
My money is on

35:01.533 --> 35:03.169
whoever left those behind.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.436
Once you let someone
get close enough

35:04.470 --> 35:06.172
to suck on your neck,

35:06.205 --> 35:08.174
nabbing fingerprints
is not gonna be a problem.

35:08.207 --> 35:10.509
PATTON:
I checked all of Reed's data.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.645
No incriminating e-mails,
calls or texts.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.914
And no trace
of the missing money, either.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.217
So he wasn't embezzling
from Youth Stripes?

35:18.250 --> 35:20.586
Oh, yeah, he was.
He just was savvy about it.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.588
He created
a fake online persona,

35:22.621 --> 35:24.590
and he used various aliases.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.858
Used them to set up accounts
in the Caymans

35:26.892 --> 35:29.195
and to communicate
with his partner in crime.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.596
Could be Kayla.
They embezzle

35:30.629 --> 35:32.231
the money together,

35:32.264 --> 35:34.333
and she sets him up
to take the fall solo.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.202
It's not Kayla!

35:36.235 --> 35:40.272
Patton, maybe you don't know
Kayla as well as you think.

35:40.306 --> 35:42.274
You're right about that one.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.210
We was together seven years ago.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.877
I was smitten.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.214
Triple P does not
get smitten.

35:48.247 --> 35:51.483
But now I realize

35:51.517 --> 35:53.285
Kayla never felt
like that for me.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.521
She was in love
with Captain Grant.

35:55.554 --> 35:58.390
I always thought one day
we'd get back together.

35:58.424 --> 35:59.891
Guess not.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.493
I'm sorry, Patton.

36:01.527 --> 36:04.263
I feel worse for her.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.498
Waiting all those years
to be with Captain Grant.

36:06.532 --> 36:09.401
Just as he was about to leave
his wife, start fresh...

36:09.435 --> 36:11.503
Wait a minute.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.939
Kayla said Grant

36:13.972 --> 36:17.343
was going to leave his wife,
and Rachel denies

36:17.376 --> 36:20.579
they were even involved.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.648
One of them got
to be lying to us.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.717
And if it's Rachel that's lying,

36:25.751 --> 36:27.519
Grant had to be in touch
with a divorce lawyer.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.255
Well, either way,
we all know

36:29.288 --> 36:30.656
there's nothing scarier
than a woman scorned.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.360
Ask all my ex-wives.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.569
Anyway, excuse me.

36:48.274 --> 36:49.941
Can I have another, please?

36:49.975 --> 36:53.612
Rachel, I'm so sorry.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.014
Jim was a wonderful man.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.516
Yes.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.585
So everyone
keeps telling me.

36:59.618 --> 37:03.489
What he did in Iraq
was heroic.

37:03.522 --> 37:04.556
Yes.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.458
He was brave.
And the money

37:06.492 --> 37:07.759
that he donated
to Youth Stripes

37:07.793 --> 37:09.595
is gonna help
so many people.

37:09.628 --> 37:12.531
How is that going to work?

37:12.564 --> 37:14.666
I heard the money was missing.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.968
That's so sad.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.638
All those at-risk kids
betrayed. Ugh.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.740
I know how they feel.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.642
You think you
were betrayed?

37:23.675 --> 37:25.411
No.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.446
Jim wouldn't betray me.

37:27.479 --> 37:29.415
He was too loyal.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.717
Too honorable.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.320
Denied--

37:34.353 --> 37:36.655
that's maybe
a more accurate term.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.790
Anyway...

37:38.824 --> 37:40.659
...we all have
our cross to bear.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.594
And mourning Jim--

37:42.628 --> 37:45.030
well, that's your job, not mine.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.065
Oh.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.434
Thank you

37:48.467 --> 37:49.735
so much for coming
to show your respects.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.737
Jim would have
appreciated that.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.440
Agent Pride,
what are you doing here?

37:54.473 --> 37:58.644
We're here in a more, uh,
official capacity.

37:58.677 --> 38:01.012
RACHEL:
Did you catch the suspect?

38:01.046 --> 38:03.014
The man who works
for Kayla's charity?

38:03.048 --> 38:05.317
Well, it turns out
it wasn't him.

38:05.351 --> 38:07.018
Someone set him up.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.087
RACHEL:
You should probably

38:09.120 --> 38:12.491
talk more with Kayla here then.

38:12.524 --> 38:15.026
You murdered your husband,
Mrs. Grant.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.628
Framed Tyson Reed.

38:16.662 --> 38:20.666
Staged his death to make
it look like suicide.

38:20.699 --> 38:24.636
It was almost...
the perfect crime.

38:24.670 --> 38:28.507
Almost, 'cause you left
a little something behind.

38:28.540 --> 38:32.678
DNA... on Tyson Reed's neck.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.783
Hope it was a good drink.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.819
'Cause it's the last one you're
gonna be having for a while.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.416
Stormy chords.

39:15.921 --> 39:19.625
Your grandmother used to get up
on this stage and start singing,

39:19.658 --> 39:21.092
and whatever was worrying you

39:21.126 --> 39:23.795
just wouldn't seem
to matter anymore.

39:23.829 --> 39:26.398
It was a gift.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.534
Came from your grandma,

39:28.567 --> 39:30.702
skipped a generation,

39:30.736 --> 39:31.903
went right into you.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.839
You're good, Dad.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.475
Yeah, I'm good, but you,
you're something special.

39:37.909 --> 39:41.447
What I can never do on the piano
just comes natural to you.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.850
It's not easy.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.151
You make it look like it is.

39:47.819 --> 39:50.388
Here's the deal.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.961
Never occurred to me that
I was putting pressure on you.

39:59.465 --> 40:01.867
Just, I love what you do
when you're doing it.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.706
Why is it so important to you?

40:07.739 --> 40:09.908
I thought it was important
to you, too.

40:12.711 --> 40:16.548
And it reminds me of my mother
and your mama.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.886
During the good times.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.725
I didn't pick
an easy career, Laurel. I...

40:26.758 --> 40:29.928
Whole family's
made sacrifices for it.

40:29.961 --> 40:32.163
And I want the same
thing for you, baby girl.

40:32.197 --> 40:35.634
Whatever it is,
whatever's right.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.503
Car salesman if you want.

40:40.672 --> 40:43.542
So you're okay
with me taking some time off?

40:46.945 --> 40:48.714
No, I'm not.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.749
What?

40:50.782 --> 40:54.553
You're a grown woman,
and you made a commitment.

40:54.586 --> 40:57.589
So,

40:57.623 --> 41:00.559
let's finish
this semester,

41:00.592 --> 41:03.862
and then we'll talk about it,
we'll figure it out.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.667
Deal.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.936
Quick.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.604
Deal.

41:12.638 --> 41:15.541
Oh, hey, wait a second.
Wait a second.

41:15.574 --> 41:17.643
Okay, what you got?

41:20.011 --> 41:22.848
Remember this one?
Oh, yeah.

41:22.881 --> 41:25.551
Too on the nose?
No, it's perfect.

41:25.584 --> 41:27.786
You sure?
Mm-hmm.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.589
Oh.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.591
Not bad.

41:32.624 --> 41:35.761
Right?

41:35.794 --> 41:37.796
* Pressure

41:37.829 --> 41:41.933
* Pushing down on me,
pressing down on you *

41:41.967 --> 41:43.969
* No man ask for

41:44.002 --> 41:45.904
* Under pressure

41:45.937 --> 41:48.707
* That brings a building down

41:48.740 --> 41:49.941
* That strips a family...

41:51.643 --> 41:53.645
* Puts people on streets
Here we go.

41:53.679 --> 41:55.714
* Mm, ba-ba-bay

41:55.747 --> 41:57.649
* Mm, ba-ba-bay

41:57.683 --> 42:00.285
* Be-better

42:00.318 --> 42:02.988
* That's okay

42:03.021 --> 42:06.592
* It's a terror knowing
what this world is about *

42:06.625 --> 42:09.628
* Watching
a good friend screaming *

42:09.661 --> 42:11.563
* Get me out

42:11.597 --> 42:15.000
* Pray tomorrow
takes me higher *

42:15.033 --> 42:17.268
* Pressure on people

42:17.302 --> 42:19.605
* People on streets

42:19.638 --> 42:20.872
* Pressure.
