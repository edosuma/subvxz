WEBVTT

00:09.500 --> 00:11.000
- DOGS!
YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY.

00:11.067 --> 00:12.800
BUT YOU HAVE
A LONGER WAY TO GO

00:12.867 --> 00:14.500
BEFORE YOU GO MULTIPLATINUM

00:14.567 --> 00:18.567
AND START SELLING OUT
50,000-SEAT STADIUMS.

00:18.633 --> 00:21.400
JAMES IS STILL
TOO SELF-CENTERED

00:21.467 --> 00:23.000
AND ONLY CARES
ABOUT HIMSELF.

00:23.067 --> 00:25.000
- JAMES AND I STILL DISAGREE.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.867
- QUIET, YOU TWO.

00:26.933 --> 00:29.867
CARLOS STILL LACKS DIRECTION.

00:29.933 --> 00:30.933
- I DO NOT.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.033
- TURN AROUND.

00:36.567 --> 00:39.933
LOGAN STILL LACKS SWAGGER.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
- YES, BUT IF YOU EVER NEED
A COLORED PENCIL,

00:43.067 --> 00:44.967
WHO YOU GONNA CALL?

00:45.033 --> 00:47.333
snap!
[screams]

00:47.400 --> 00:50.767
- AND KENDALL NEEDS TO STOP
TALKING BACK TO ME

00:50.833 --> 00:52.300
AFTER EVERYTHING I SAY.

00:52.367 --> 00:54.467
- AND GUSTAVO
NEEDS TO TAKE--

00:54.533 --> 00:55.600
- DON'T SAY IT.

00:55.667 --> 00:59.500
NOT ONE MORE WORD.

01:03.467 --> 01:04.400
GOOD.

01:04.467 --> 01:05.400
- CHILL PILL.

01:05.467 --> 01:06.400
- [grunts]

01:06.467 --> 01:10.067
[low rumbling]

01:10.100 --> 01:12.333
[whistle blows]

01:12.400 --> 01:14.067
both: STEAM.

01:14.067 --> 01:16.133
- OH, THAT'S A NEW ONE.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.200
- RUN.
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH *

01:18.267 --> 01:19.633
- [screams]

01:19.700 --> 01:21.600
- * MAKE IT COUNT,
PLAY IT STRAIGHT *

01:21.667 --> 01:23.400
* DON'T LOOK BACK,
DON'T HESITATE *

01:23.467 --> 01:27.533
- * WHEN YOU GO BIG TIME *

01:27.600 --> 01:29.500
- * WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT YOU FEEL *

01:29.567 --> 01:31.267
* NEVER QUIT
AND MAKE IT REAL *

01:31.333 --> 01:34.367
- * WHEN YOU ROLL BIG TIME *

01:34.433 --> 01:35.467
- * OH-OH, OH-OH *

01:35.533 --> 01:37.300
- * HEY, HEY *

01:37.367 --> 01:39.400
- * LISTEN TO YOUR HEART NOW *

01:39.467 --> 01:41.367
- * HEY, HEY *

01:41.433 --> 01:43.500
- * DON'T YOU FEEL THE RUSH *

01:43.567 --> 01:45.100
- * UH-OH, UH-OH *

01:45.167 --> 01:46.300
* UH-OH, UH-OH *

01:46.367 --> 01:47.300
- * OH *

01:47.367 --> 01:48.700
- * GO AND SHAKE IT UP *

01:48.767 --> 01:51.267
* WHATCHA GOTTA LOSE *

01:51.333 --> 01:52.867
* GO AND MAKE YOUR LUCK *

01:52.933 --> 01:55.167
* WITH THE LIFE YOU CHOOSE *

01:55.233 --> 01:58.900
* IF YOU WANT IT ALL,
LAY IT ON THE LINE *

01:58.967 --> 02:04.200
* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT
SO YOU GOT TO LIVE IT BIG TIME *

02:06.667 --> 02:10.067
[all screaming]

02:10.133 --> 02:12.733
- GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

02:12.800 --> 02:14.767
smash!
- [screaming]

02:14.833 --> 02:16.067
[screaming continues]

02:16.100 --> 02:18.100
GET DOWN HERE!
GET DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW!

02:18.167 --> 02:19.900
- NOT UNTIL YOU CHILLAX.

02:19.967 --> 02:20.900
- YEAH.

02:20.967 --> 02:23.067
- OH, I AM CHILLAXED!

02:26.900 --> 02:28.100
WHERE DO YOU KEEP YOUR KNIVES?

02:28.167 --> 02:29.533
- UM, IN THE DRAWER
NEXT TO THE SINK.

02:29.600 --> 02:30.867
[all shouting indistinctly]

02:34.533 --> 02:35.933
all: BUDDHA BOB!
HELP!

02:36.067 --> 02:37.633
- AHA!

02:37.700 --> 02:39.633
AHH...

02:39.700 --> 02:41.733
[moaning]

02:41.800 --> 02:43.267
[bones crack]
- OOH!

02:43.333 --> 02:44.567
- WHAT WAS THAT?

02:44.633 --> 02:46.167
- HIMALAYAN MONKEY PINCH.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.967
THEN I REALIGNED YOUR CHAKRAS.

02:48.067 --> 02:49.800
- I FEEL SO...

02:49.867 --> 02:50.800
SO--

02:50.867 --> 02:51.800
- CALM.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.067
NOW FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS,

02:53.133 --> 02:55.833
NOT WHAT ANGERS.

02:55.900 --> 02:58.200
- BOYS, I MUST WRITE A SONG

02:58.267 --> 03:00.067
FOR THE NEW TOWN HIGH
SOUNDTRACK.

03:00.067 --> 03:02.967
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I NEED VOCALS.

03:08.233 --> 03:10.067
- [giggles]
WHOA, WHOA, WAIT!

03:10.100 --> 03:12.067
- BUDDHA BOB,
YOU JUST SAVED OUR LIVES.

03:12.067 --> 03:15.200
- YEAH, WELL,
THAT WAS A BIG CLOG.

03:15.267 --> 03:18.200
- AND THAT QUOTE,
WAS THAT BUDDHA OR SOCRATES--

03:18.267 --> 03:20.233
- FORTUNE COOKIE.
- OH.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.667
- YOU GUYS SHOULD TRY LISTENING
TO YOUR BOSS MORE OFTEN.

03:22.733 --> 03:25.400
HE'LL LESS STRESSED
AND WON'T WANT TO KILL YOU.

03:29.533 --> 03:30.700
- YOU KNOW, HE'S RIGHT.

03:30.767 --> 03:32.833
GUSTAVO WORKS HIS BUTT OFF
FOR US,

03:32.900 --> 03:36.067
AND I DO TEND
TO TALK BACK A BIT.

03:36.067 --> 03:40.533
- YEAH, I MEAN, I KIND OF DO
LACK DIRECTION SOMETIMES.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.600
- OKAY, I GUESS I COULD USE
A LITTLE MORE SWAGGER.

03:43.667 --> 03:46.733
- AND I SUPPOSE
I CAN PUT DOWN MY MIRROR.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.300
all: JAMES, PUT IT DOWN.

03:50.367 --> 03:51.433
- YOU CAN DO IT.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.367
- YOU GOT THIS.
YOU GOT THIS.

03:53.433 --> 03:54.333
- YES.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.600
THEN IT'S AGREED.

03:55.667 --> 03:57.533
WE ARE GOING
TO LISTEN TO GUSTAVO

03:57.600 --> 04:00.567
SO HE'S LESS STRESSED
AND WON'T KILL US.

04:02.433 --> 04:04.400
all: WHOA, BREAK!

04:04.467 --> 04:05.633
- OKAY, DIRECTION.
DIRECTION.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.067
I GOT TO FOCUS,
FIND DIRECTION--

04:07.067 --> 04:08.667
[bird squawks]

04:08.733 --> 04:11.367
OH!
A PRETTY BIRD.

04:11.433 --> 04:12.867
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?

04:12.933 --> 04:15.733
- THE REGIONAL MANAGER
GAVE ME $10,000

04:15.800 --> 04:17.533
TO COMPLETELY
MAKE OVER THE LOBBY.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.967
SO I BOUGHT
THIS BOWL OF WAX FRUIT

04:20.067 --> 04:21.967
AND THIS $40 PARROT.

04:22.067 --> 04:22.967
- HELLO.

04:23.067 --> 04:24.400
- COOL.

04:24.467 --> 04:26.967
- AND WITH THE MONEY I SAVED...

04:27.067 --> 04:28.900
[horn honks]

04:28.967 --> 04:31.600
I BOUGHT
THIS CUSTOMIZED SCOOTER.

04:31.667 --> 04:34.967
BECAUSE WALKING
IS FOR SUCKERS.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.500
AND I ADDED A GPS

04:36.567 --> 04:39.067
SO I ALWAYS KNOW
I'M GOING THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

04:39.067 --> 04:41.267
[horn honks]

04:41.333 --> 04:43.167
- WHERE AM I GONNA GET
SOME DIRECTION?

04:43.233 --> 04:44.600
- HEED MY VOICE.

04:44.667 --> 04:45.867
I KNOW ALL.

04:45.933 --> 04:48.300
- OKAY.

04:48.367 --> 04:49.267
OOH!

04:49.333 --> 04:50.700
SHOULD I ASK THE NEW GIRL,

04:50.767 --> 04:53.200
WHO IS WAY OUT OF MY LEAGUE,
OUT ON A DATE?

04:53.267 --> 04:55.333
- [squawks]
TODAY IS YOUR LUCKY DAY.

04:58.233 --> 04:59.167
- HI.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.767
I'M CARLOS.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.233
- [squawks]

05:02.300 --> 05:03.667
- DO YOU WANT TO GO
ON A DATE WITH ME TONIGHT?

05:03.733 --> 05:04.900
- [chuckles]
SURE.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.333
YOU WANT TO MEET HERE
AROUND 8:00?

05:06.400 --> 05:07.333
- UH-HUH.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.267
- OKAY.
SEE YOU.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.833
- YOU'RE NOT JUST ANY PARROT.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.833
I SHALL CALL YOU...

05:14.900 --> 05:16.300
SUPER PARROT.

05:16.367 --> 05:17.667
- [squawks]

05:17.733 --> 05:20.500
- OKAY, SO I TRADED IN
MY JAMES T-SHIRT

05:20.567 --> 05:21.867
FOR ONE WITH ALL OF US.

05:21.933 --> 05:23.533
AND I'VE DECIDED

05:23.600 --> 05:25.500
TO MAKE MORE EYE CONTACT
WITH YOU GUYS.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.900
- OKAY.

05:29.967 --> 05:32.167
WELL, I'VE DECIDED
TO INCREASE MY SWAGGER

05:32.233 --> 05:33.667
BY CREATING A SWAGGER APP

05:33.733 --> 05:35.067
WHICH WILL AUTOMATICALLY PUSH

05:35.067 --> 05:37.333
THE SWAGGIEST TRENDS,
CLOTHES, AND MOVES

05:37.400 --> 05:41.067
FROM THE NET
RIGHT TO MY PHONE.

05:41.067 --> 05:42.067
- [laughs]

05:42.100 --> 05:43.833
DUDE, YOU EITHER HAVE SWAGGER,

05:43.900 --> 05:45.167
OR YOU DON'T.

05:45.233 --> 05:46.167
AND I HAVE TONS.

05:46.233 --> 05:48.133
SO LET ME HELP YOU.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.700
- NO NEED,
'CAUSE I AM FULLY LOADED.

05:51.767 --> 05:53.667
NOW I JUST PRESS SWAGGER APP,

05:53.733 --> 05:54.767
AND...

05:58.567 --> 06:00.567
- OKAY.
YOU LOOK COOL.

06:00.633 --> 06:03.433
BUT SWAGGER
COMES FROM WITHIN.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.533
IT'S NOT DIGITAL.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.467
- OH-HO.
IT'S DIGITAL.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.500
- YOU'RE TAMPERING
WITH FORCES

06:15.567 --> 06:17.200
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

06:17.267 --> 06:18.400
- HEY, GUSTAVO,

06:18.467 --> 06:20.100
I JUST WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE FOR...

06:20.167 --> 06:21.933
TALKING BACK.

06:22.067 --> 06:23.133
WHERE'S GUSTAVO?

06:23.200 --> 06:24.467
- I THOUGHT
HE WAS KILLING YOU GUYS.

06:24.533 --> 06:25.900
- OH, NO, HE WAS,

06:25.967 --> 06:28.767
BUT BUDDHA BOB GAVE HIM
THIS MONKEY TOUCH...

06:28.833 --> 06:29.767
AND HE STOPPED.

06:29.833 --> 06:31.067
- HE NEEDS TO BE HERE

06:31.133 --> 06:32.567
WRITING A SONG
FOR NEW TOWN HIGH.

06:32.633 --> 06:35.533
GETTING ON THE SOUNDTRACK
IS HUGE FOR BTR.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.067
THE PRODUCERS
ARE COMING TOMORROW

06:37.067 --> 06:39.067
TO HEAR GUSTAVO'S AMAZING SONG,

06:39.100 --> 06:41.300
WHICH HASN'T BEEN WRITTEN YET.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.667
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:42.733 --> 06:44.267
- TRACKING HIS CELL PHONE.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.900
DON'T TELL HIM I DO THIS.

06:46.967 --> 06:50.500
- HE'S IN PALMWOODS PARK?

06:50.567 --> 06:52.867
- HEY, BUDDHA GUY.

06:52.933 --> 06:54.333
- HEY.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.067
- SO I WAS FEELING, YOU KNOW,
CALM THIS MORNING,

06:57.067 --> 06:58.867
AFTER YOU DID THAT THING.

06:58.933 --> 07:00.900
BUT THEN ON MY WAY BACK TO WORK,
IT WENT AWAY.

07:00.967 --> 07:03.267
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:03.333 --> 07:04.633
- YOU'RE STRESSED OUT.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.067
- UH, YEAH, WHO ISN'T?

07:06.067 --> 07:07.267
- ME.

07:07.333 --> 07:08.400
- REALLY?

07:08.467 --> 07:09.967
YOU'RE NEVER STRESSED?
EVER?

07:10.067 --> 07:11.667
- NOPE.

07:11.733 --> 07:13.933
- SHARE YOUR EXPERT WISDOM
WITH ME!

07:14.067 --> 07:15.767
PLEASE.
I'M BEGGING YOU.

07:15.833 --> 07:19.100
- UH, WELL,
ALWAYS TRIM THE HEDGES EVENLY,

07:19.167 --> 07:21.600
NEVER TRY TO FLUSH
A CLOGGED TOILET,

07:21.667 --> 07:23.267
AND BEWARE OF SQUIRRELS,

07:23.333 --> 07:25.433
'CAUSE SOMETIMES
THEY DROP THEIR NUTS.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.267
- SO YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD

07:28.333 --> 07:31.800
TRIM THE EXCESS FROM MY LIFE
TO KEEP IT EVEN,

07:31.867 --> 07:33.333
UNCLOG MY MIND,

07:33.400 --> 07:35.500
AND STAY AWAY
FROM ALL THE NUTS IN THIS TOWN.

07:35.567 --> 07:37.267
- UH, OKAY.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.500
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:38.567 --> 07:40.067
YOU'VE GOT A SOUNDTRACK SONG
TO WRITE.

07:40.067 --> 07:41.200
- KELLY.

07:41.267 --> 07:42.667
KENDALL.

07:42.733 --> 07:45.367
THIS MAN'S WISDOM
HAS JUST OPENED MY EYES

07:45.433 --> 07:47.967
TO A LIFE
I NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.500
- WHAT DID YOU DO TO GUSTAVO?

07:53.567 --> 07:54.967
- WHO'S GUSTAVO?

07:56.867 --> 07:57.867
- WOW.

07:57.933 --> 07:59.167
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ALL SPIFFY?

07:59.233 --> 08:00.800
- TO THE LOBBY

08:00.867 --> 08:02.633
TO SEE IF SUPER PARROT
LIKES THIS OUTFIT FOR MY DATE.

08:02.700 --> 08:03.900
- SUPER WHAT?

08:03.967 --> 08:05.667
- HE HATED THE LAST ONE.

08:05.733 --> 08:07.067
HOPE HE GOES FOR THIS ONE.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.333
SUPER PARROT,

08:11.400 --> 08:12.400
IS THIS A BETTER OUTFIT?

08:12.467 --> 08:13.633
- I SEE SUCCESS IN YOUR FUTURE.

08:13.700 --> 08:14.667
[squawks]

08:14.733 --> 08:16.067
- YES!

08:16.100 --> 08:17.667
- PLEASE DO NOT TELL ME
YOU ACTUALLY THINK

08:17.733 --> 08:19.400
BITTERS' NEW PARROT
CAN TELL THE FUTURE.

08:19.467 --> 08:20.867
- ALL I KNOW IS THAT

08:20.933 --> 08:22.600
SINCE SUPER PARROT
STARTED GIVING ME DIRECTION,

08:22.667 --> 08:23.900
I'VE GOT A HOT DATE,

08:23.967 --> 08:25.267
AND I LOOK GOOD.

08:25.333 --> 08:26.333
- WHAT?

08:26.400 --> 08:27.600
- CHECK IT OUT.

08:27.667 --> 08:29.067
SUPER PARROT,

08:29.133 --> 08:30.833
SHOULD I GET SOME MINTS
FROM THE VENDING MACHINE?

08:30.900 --> 08:32.267
- [squawks]
OUTLOOK IS GOOD.

08:32.333 --> 08:33.967
- SWEET.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.300
[change jingling]

08:39.367 --> 08:43.267
[screaming]
SWEET!

08:43.333 --> 08:44.900
SWEET!

08:44.967 --> 08:48.067
NOW I'M GONNA HAVE FRESH BREATH
AND MONEY FOR MY DATE.

08:48.067 --> 08:49.867
HEY, YOU ASK HIM A QUESTION.

08:49.933 --> 08:52.067
- NO.
BECAUSE IT'S JUST A BIRD.

08:52.067 --> 08:53.700
DO I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT?

08:53.767 --> 08:54.867
- SIGNS POINT TO YES.

08:54.933 --> 08:57.167
[squawks]

09:32.367 --> 09:34.700
KEEP EXCHANGES SHORT,
AND TRY THESE NICKNAMES.

09:34.767 --> 09:36.067
- [scoffs]
NICKNAMES?

09:36.067 --> 09:39.067
WHAT ARE NICKNAMES GONNA DO?

09:39.100 --> 09:41.533

HAVE MORE SWAGGER THAN YOU?

BUDDHA BOB AND I

KELLY NEEDS US AT THE STUDIO

11:46.867 --> 11:47.933
FOR AN EMERGENCY BAND MEETING

11:48.067 --> 11:49.167
BECAUSE MELLOW GUSTAVO

11:49.233 --> 11:51.267
EQUALS THE WORST
SOUNDTRACK SONG EVER.

11:51.333 --> 11:52.400
SO LET'S GO.

11:52.467 --> 11:54.333
- [sighs]
CAN'T, K-DOG.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.700
I'M UPDATING MY SWAG APP
FOR EVEN MORE SWAG-ITUDE.

11:58.767 --> 12:00.500
[pounding on door]

12:00.567 --> 12:02.167

COME OUT OF THE BATHROOM.

12:02.233 --> 12:04.367
- PANIC ROOM!

12:04.433 --> 12:06.900
- A BIRD TOLD HIM
HE'S GOT 24 HOURS TO LIVE.

12:06.967 --> 12:09.333
BUT I GOT TO BRUSH MY TEETH!
[pounds on door]

12:09.400 --> 12:11.733
- WELL,
I'VE GOT TO SAVE MY LIFE!

12:11.800 --> 12:13.867
SUPER PARROT KNOWS ALL.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.433
- [coughs]

12:16.500 --> 12:18.467
AND I FEEL COLD AND CLAMMY.

12:18.533 --> 12:20.567
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE
TO LOSE THEIR SWAGGER?

12:20.633 --> 12:22.100
- WHAT?

12:22.167 --> 12:24.067
- IF THERE'S A FINITE AMOUNT
OF SWAGGER IN THE BAND

12:24.100 --> 12:27.700
AND IF SOMEONE
WERE TO GAIN SWAGGER...

12:27.767 --> 12:30.667
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE ELSE
TO LOSE THEIR SWAGGER?

12:30.733 --> 12:33.433
- OKAY, I'LL GO ALONE.

12:35.800 --> 12:36.833
- WHERE ARE THE OTHER GUYS?

12:36.900 --> 12:38.067
- BEING NUTS.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.667
AND I BET GUSTAVO
WENT HOME LAST NIGHT,

12:40.733 --> 12:43.067
REALIZED THE SONG STUNK,
KICKED HIS CAT,

12:43.067 --> 12:45.700
AND FORGOT ABOUT
THE WHOLE BUDDHA BOB THING.

12:45.767 --> 12:46.767
SO CHILL.
- KENDALL.

12:46.833 --> 12:49.267
GURUS ARE ROCK AND ROLL POISON.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.833
IT HAPPENED TO THE BEACH BOYS
AND THE BEATLES.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.300
THEY LATCH ON
TO SOME SPIRITUAL WHACK JOB,

12:54.367 --> 12:56.533
AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE WEARING ROBES

12:56.600 --> 12:57.767
AND HEADING TO TIBET

12:57.833 --> 12:59.200
AND BYE-BYE, BAND.

12:59.267 --> 13:00.667
SO DON'T THINK
THAT IT CAN'T HAPPEN

13:00.733 --> 13:02.233
TO BIG TIME RUSH.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.067
- I'LL BELIEVE THAT
WHEN I SEE IT.

13:04.100 --> 13:07.233
- GOOD MORNING, SKY CHILDREN.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.233
slap!
- AND NOW I'VE SEEN IT.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.433
- I LISTENED TO THE SONG
LAST NIGHT,

13:11.500 --> 13:13.200
AND I REALIZED SOMETHING.

13:13.267 --> 13:15.067
- THAT IT'S HORRIFYING?

13:15.100 --> 13:18.567
- THAT IT NEEDED WHALE NOISES.

13:18.633 --> 13:21.067
[psychedelic music

13:21.067 --> 13:25.367

FAULT.

13:35.900 --> 13:37.700
NOW, GET HIM OVER HERE
TO FIX THAT,

13:37.767 --> 13:40.867

17:40.100 --> 17:42.300
- MAYBE THAT'S NOT
SUCH A BAD THING.

17:42.367 --> 17:43.700
- YES, IT IS.

17:43.767 --> 17:45.200
BECAUSE THEN
THEY WOULD HAVE HEARD IT,

17:45.267 --> 17:46.200
AND IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

17:46.267 --> 17:47.433
- REMEMBER, KELLY,

17:47.500 --> 17:50.233
TIME IS JUST AN ILLUSION.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.967
- OH, YEAH.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.267
- OKAY, WHATEVER THIS PLAN IS,

17:55.333 --> 17:56.800
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET
THE BUCKET OF LOVE

17:56.867 --> 17:58.100
BACK TO THE STUDIO?

17:58.167 --> 18:01.267
- OH, I CAN GET HIM THERE.

18:01.333 --> 18:02.567
[motor revs]

18:02.633 --> 18:05.667
[tires squealing]

18:09.233 --> 18:10.967
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.

18:11.067 --> 18:13.567
- [pounding on door]
- GO AWAY, DEATH!

18:13.633 --> 18:14.767
- IT'S ME...

18:14.833 --> 18:16.067
AND SUPER PARROT.

18:16.067 --> 18:17.833
- SUPER PARROT!
[screams]

18:17.900 --> 18:18.900
- HELLO.
[squawks]

18:18.967 --> 18:19.900
- WHO'S THAT?

18:19.967 --> 18:22.667
- THIS IS MADAME ZINZIBAR.

18:22.733 --> 18:24.833
SHE LOST HER PARROT LAST WEEK

18:24.900 --> 18:27.567
WHEN HE FLEW OUT
OF HER FORTUNE-TELLER SHOP.

18:27.633 --> 18:28.567
- [gasps]

18:28.633 --> 18:29.867
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

18:29.933 --> 18:31.733
SUPER PARROT'S
A FORTUNE-TELLER TOO.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.167
- MY DEAR, CONFUSED BOY,

18:34.233 --> 18:36.633
PICKLES IS NOT
A FORTUNE-TELLER.

18:36.700 --> 18:40.067
HE LIKES TO REPEAT WORDS HE
HEARS ME SAY IN THE SHOP A LOT,

18:40.067 --> 18:41.333
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE...

18:41.400 --> 18:42.833
"WITHOUT A DOUBT,"

18:42.900 --> 18:45.767
AND, "SIGNS POINT TO YES."

18:45.833 --> 18:48.067
- OH, SO YOU JUST GO OFF
AND TELL YOUR CLIENTS

18:48.067 --> 18:49.767
THAT THEY HAVE
"24 HOURS TO LIVE"?

18:49.833 --> 18:51.100
- NO.

18:51.167 --> 18:54.067
PICKLES IS ALSO ADDICTED
TO HOSPITAL DRAMAS.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.367
- [squawks]
GET HIM INTO THE O.R., STAT!

18:56.433 --> 18:57.633
CLEAR!
CLEAR!

18:57.700 --> 19:00.567
- SO I'M NOT GONNA DIE?

19:00.633 --> 19:02.100
YES!

19:02.167 --> 19:04.067
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

19:04.067 --> 19:06.500
OH, KATIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:06.567 --> 19:09.200
- BEING ABLE TO BRUSH MY TEETH
IS THANKS ENOUGH.

19:11.600 --> 19:12.767
- [coughs]

19:12.833 --> 19:15.067
- AND WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT ONE?

19:15.067 --> 19:17.067
- HE LOST HIS SWAGGER.

19:17.100 --> 19:18.067
- OH.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.400
- * SOMEDAY *

19:19.467 --> 19:21.067
* WE WILL WORK IT OUT *

19:21.133 --> 19:22.367
* I KNOW *

19:22.433 --> 19:25.067
* WE CAN TURN IT UP
ALL THE WAY *

19:25.133 --> 19:27.233
[door slams]

19:27.300 --> 19:28.900
- [exhales deeply]

19:28.967 --> 19:29.967
WHOA.

19:30.067 --> 19:33.633
IS THAT AN EKG?

19:33.700 --> 19:35.567
- SKG.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.967
HIS SWAG COUNT
IS DANGEROUSLY LOW.

19:38.067 --> 19:42.067
- AS YOU GROW STRONGER...
[coughs]

19:42.100 --> 19:43.633
I GROW WEAKER.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.733
- FINE.
YOU CAN HAVE IT BACK.

19:45.800 --> 19:46.933
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT THE SWAGGER.

19:47.067 --> 19:48.067
MY PANTS ARE TOO TIGHT,

19:48.133 --> 19:49.400
EVERYONE KEEPS FOLLOWING ME,

19:49.467 --> 19:51.833
AND HONESTLY,
THERE'S TOO MUCH DANCING.

19:51.900 --> 19:52.833
- REALLY?

19:52.900 --> 19:54.533
- YEAH, LOOK.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.267
SWAGGER APP DELETED.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.733
[rapid beeping]

19:58.800 --> 19:59.900
- I'M BETTER NOW.

20:00.067 --> 20:01.600
- SO AM I.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.567
BUT YOU DO REALIZE YOUR SYMPTOMS
WERE PSYCHOSOMATIC?

20:04.633 --> 20:06.900
- AND YOU DO REALIZE
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS?

20:06.967 --> 20:10.067
BUT I DO KNOW
WE LOOK PRETTY AGAIN.

20:10.133 --> 20:12.433
- [squawks]

20:12.500 --> 20:13.900
- AND YOU'RE NOT WORRIED

20:13.967 --> 20:16.100
GUSTAVO WILL BE MAD
YOU THREW AWAY YOUR SWAGGER

20:16.167 --> 20:19.700
AND YOU
STILL TALK TO YOUR MIRROR?

20:19.767 --> 20:20.900
- NAH.

20:20.967 --> 20:23.400
HE'S REALLY NICE NOW.

20:23.467 --> 20:25.733
- * CANDY CASTLE UP ABOVE *

20:25.800 --> 20:27.033
- * LA, LA, LA *

20:27.100 --> 20:30.133
- * THIS MUST BE NEW TOWN HIGH *

20:30.200 --> 20:32.800
- * HIGH *

20:32.867 --> 20:35.500
- GUSTAVO, THAT SONG'S
GONNA MAKE THE TOP TEN.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.967
- WELL, THANK YOU.

20:38.033 --> 20:39.833
- TOP TEN REASONS
TO KILL MYSELF.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.700
[laughter]

20:41.767 --> 20:43.233
- THAT'S A LITTLE HARSH.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.033
- YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE A HIT,
GONNA BE ON THE CHARTS.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.400
YOU KNOW WHY?

20:46.467 --> 20:48.333
IT'S GOT NUMBER TWO
SMEARED ALL OVER IT.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.767
[laughter]
- HUH?

20:49.833 --> 20:51.533
- WHAT WAS IT,
A COMMERCIAL FOR EARPLUGS?

20:51.600 --> 20:53.067
- WHAT?

20:53.133 --> 20:54.067
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:54.133 --> 20:55.833
I SMELL GRAMMY.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.333
AND MY GRAMMY'S BEEN DEAD
FOR TEN YEARS.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.567
[laughter]

21:00.633 --> 21:01.700
- [grunts]

21:01.767 --> 21:02.667
- WHOA.

21:02.733 --> 21:04.733
[whistle blowing]

21:04.800 --> 21:06.100
- [screams]

21:06.167 --> 21:08.733
GET OUT!

21:08.800 --> 21:10.067
- NO.
- COME ON.

21:10.133 --> 21:11.167
GET OUT OF HERE!

21:11.233 --> 21:14.100
YOU GET OUT OF HERE!
[screams]

21:14.167 --> 21:16.733
NO ONE TALKS ABOUT MY MUSIC
LIKE THAT,

21:16.800 --> 21:18.767
EVEN IF IT WAS THE WORST SONG
I'VE EVER WRITTEN.

21:18.833 --> 21:21.233
- LUCKILY, THOSE WEREN'T
THE REAL PRODUCERS.

21:21.300 --> 21:22.233
- HUH?

21:22.300 --> 21:23.600
- YEAH, WE HIRED AN INSULT COMIC

21:23.667 --> 21:26.767
TO MAKE YOU HATEFUL
AND TALENTED AGAIN.

21:26.833 --> 21:28.200
BOOSH.

21:28.267 --> 21:30.833
THE ACTUAL PRODUCER
WILL BE HERE IN TWO HOURS.

21:30.900 --> 21:32.500

SONG TO PRODUCE.

21:35.900 --> 21:38.333
[screams]

21:38.400 --> 21:40.100
- * 'CAUSE THE WORLD STOPS *

- GOOD, 'CAUSE I AM DONE
TAKING ADVICE FROM BIRDS.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.833

ALL THE SWAGGER I NEED

22:39.067 --> 22:40.533
WITH A SIMPLE PAIR OF SHADES.
