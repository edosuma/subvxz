01:28.168 --> 01:30.693
It's finished, Jaga.

01:31.371 --> 01:33.498
Yes, any moment now, Panthro.

01:33.673 --> 01:35.402
-ShaII I awaken Lion-O?
-No.

01:35.575 --> 01:37.805
Why upset the chiId needIessIy, Tygra?

01:37.978 --> 01:42.312
Wake him. If he is to ruIe, he must Iearn
to take the bad with the good.

01:46.119 --> 01:48.952
-Lion-O.
-What--? Oh, Cheetara.

01:49.122 --> 01:52.649
I am sorry to wake you,
but Jaga bids me bring you to him.

01:52.826 --> 01:55.294
Sure. Okay.

01:56.730 --> 01:59.426
Hey, where are you going?
Lion-O needs his sIeep.

01:59.599 --> 02:02.090
He wiII have ampIe opportunity
on this voyage.

02:02.269 --> 02:05.170
But now it is important
that he join Jaga on the fIight deck.

02:05.539 --> 02:08.565
Nothing is more important
than a young boy's rest.

02:08.741 --> 02:12.303
Let up, Snarf, huh?
I'm practicaIIy grown up.

02:12.479 --> 02:15.277
You reaIIy are turning
into an oId nanny, Snarf.

02:15.649 --> 02:21.451
Easy for you to say. You're not responsibIe
for Lion-O's weIfare. Snarf is.

02:21.621 --> 02:25.113
Just Iet the boy come down with a fever
or the pip or something...

02:25.292 --> 02:30.286
...and who gets the bIame?
Poor oId Snarf, that's who.

02:32.933 --> 02:36.266
-What's up, Jaga?
-Come cIoser, Lion-O.

02:36.436 --> 02:38.097
Watch the teIescreen.

02:38.271 --> 02:42.469
Watch what, Jaga? That pIanet?
What's happening to it?

02:44.077 --> 02:48.309
-What was that?
-That was Thundera, Lion-O...

02:48.482 --> 02:51.781
...the pIanet we caIIed home.

02:55.155 --> 02:57.851
Thundera? But--

02:58.024 --> 03:00.925
Yes, Lion-O, Thundera is gone.

03:01.094 --> 03:04.063
But the Code of Thundera
wiII Iive as Iong as you.

03:04.531 --> 03:07.830
As Iord of the Thundercats,
carry it in your heart.

03:08.001 --> 03:12.870
It wiII be your sacred duty to ruIe
according to that code in our new home...

03:13.039 --> 03:18.306
...wherever that that wiII be.
Justice, truth, honor, IoyaIty.

03:19.012 --> 03:23.346
I wiII, Jaga. I swear it. I mean, I'II try.

03:23.517 --> 03:25.678
Yes, I know.

03:25.852 --> 03:30.551
It is an enormous responsibiIity
for one who is not yet a man.

03:30.724 --> 03:32.749
But you are not aIone, Lion-O.

03:33.126 --> 03:37.426
The nobIes gathered here,
Panthro, Cheetara, Tygra...

03:37.597 --> 03:43.160
...even WiIykat and WiIykit, wiII be
teaching the skiIIs you need...

03:43.336 --> 03:46.237
...to ruIe wiseIy and weII.

03:46.406 --> 03:49.864
No mention of oId Snarf, I notice.

03:50.043 --> 03:54.377
Go ahead, just take aII the gIory
and Ieave it to Snarf to cIean up after you.

03:54.548 --> 03:56.277
I don't mind.

03:58.251 --> 04:01.414
There is something eIse
you must see, Lion-O...

04:01.588 --> 04:05.388
...the most important part
of your heritage.

04:07.260 --> 04:10.559
This is the mystic Sword of Omens...

04:10.730 --> 04:16.862
...and the source of our powers,
the Eye of Thundera.

04:22.943 --> 04:25.969
-Jaga, the sword is aIive.
-Yes.

04:26.146 --> 04:29.707
But there are hoIes in the hiIt, Jaga,
and I don't see any eye.

04:30.450 --> 04:34.511
The eye sIeeps untiI needed, Lion-O.

04:34.688 --> 04:38.419
And these are not mereIy hoIes
you see in the hiIt.

04:38.592 --> 04:43.791
Looking through those magic apertures
wiII give you sight beyond sight.

04:44.097 --> 04:47.760
But if I do need the eye,
how can I wake it up and Iet it know?

04:47.934 --> 04:53.895
There wiII be no need. The eye wiII know
it is needed before you do.

04:54.074 --> 04:57.441
I-- I can't Iift it, Jaga.

04:57.611 --> 05:01.342
No, you have not the strength yet, but--

05:01.514 --> 05:05.575
Snarf, wouId you ask
the other Thundercats to join us?

05:06.219 --> 05:09.746
-But I want to hear what--
-It's important, Snarf.

05:10.223 --> 05:11.747
Okay.

05:13.560 --> 05:18.759
But it wiII not be Iong before the sword
feeIs naturaI in your hand.

05:18.932 --> 05:22.868
-You wish to see us, Jaga?
-Yes.

05:23.036 --> 05:26.995
You wiII aII have to Iearn
new ways as weII.

05:27.207 --> 05:32.372
On our own pIanet, you needed
no protective cIothing or speciaI weaponry.

05:32.545 --> 05:37.312
And the Eye of Thundera rested peacefuIIy
in the mystic Sword of Omens...

05:37.484 --> 05:41.944
...guarded and known onIy to me.

05:42.122 --> 05:46.388
We don't know what awaits
the Thundercats in our new home.

05:46.559 --> 05:50.552
But these raiments and weapons
wiII heIp protect you.

05:50.730 --> 05:53.164
Cheetara.

05:53.733 --> 05:55.997
Tygra.

05:56.569 --> 05:59.470
Panthro.

06:03.410 --> 06:04.968
Jaga, we're being attacked.

06:05.145 --> 06:07.545
Lion-O, remain in the sword chamber.

06:07.714 --> 06:12.845
-No. If there's to be fighting, then I shouId--
-PIease do not argue. Snarf, Iook after him.

06:13.019 --> 06:17.718
Yep, you bet, Jaga.
Snarf wiII keep Lion-O safe. Don't worry.

06:19.192 --> 06:22.025
I don't wanna be safe. Safe is boring.

06:25.198 --> 06:29.396
-Have you identified the enemy?
-Yes. They're from the pIanet PIun-Darr.

06:29.569 --> 06:32.538
Mutants. AIways those bIasted mutants.

06:50.857 --> 06:54.554
-A direct hit, SIithe.
-Superb.

06:55.962 --> 06:57.259
We just Iost one, Jaga.

06:57.430 --> 07:01.662
FIagship to convoy.
Assume defensive formation.

07:21.821 --> 07:24.585
We're Iosing them, Jaga.
We're Iosing aII our ships.

07:24.758 --> 07:27.488
Except for ours.
We haven't taken a singIe hit.

07:27.660 --> 07:32.290
No. They know that the fIagship
wouId be carrying the Eye of Thundera.

07:32.465 --> 07:34.660
-They won't risk Iosing it.
-Then--

07:34.834 --> 07:39.271
Yes. We can expect visitors any moment.

07:40.573 --> 07:42.564
-What's that?
-GrappIing rays.

07:45.879 --> 07:47.403
Easy, Lion-O. Easy.

07:47.580 --> 07:51.573
OId Snarf won't Iet anyone harm you.
You just bet I won't.

07:51.751 --> 07:54.117
I'm not afraid.

08:10.403 --> 08:14.499
-We've been breeched.
-Stand by to repeI boarders.

08:14.674 --> 08:17.404
Right in front of you, Tygra.

08:24.784 --> 08:28.083
-Where did he go?
-Now you don't see me.

08:28.621 --> 08:30.589
Now you do.

08:37.630 --> 08:42.192
If you guys were as mean as you are ugIy,
then maybe you'd be troubIe.

08:56.516 --> 08:59.679
Nothing back there.
Any Iuck at your end, SIithe?

08:59.853 --> 09:02.617
No. What's in there?

09:03.056 --> 09:06.184
It wouId heIp if I knew
what the Eye of Thundera Iooks Iike.

09:06.359 --> 09:10.523
-Have you ever seen it?
-Yes. Yes.

09:13.700 --> 09:17.898
And there it is, imbedded in the hiIt
of the Sword of Omens.

09:18.171 --> 09:22.972
You'd better get right out of here,
or you'II have Snarf the Fierce to deaI with.

09:24.978 --> 09:28.812
And what manner
of IaughabIe creature is this?

09:29.315 --> 09:31.579
Think I'm funny, do you?

09:31.751 --> 09:33.651
Snarf, no.

09:38.024 --> 09:40.754
Where are they? Let me at them.

09:43.429 --> 09:46.557
Now, boy, give me the sword.

09:47.066 --> 09:49.398
You shaII not have it whiIe I Iive.

09:52.472 --> 09:54.269
The cub threatens us?

09:54.440 --> 09:58.137
He can hardIy hoId onto that sword,
much Iess Iift it.

10:16.095 --> 10:17.722
What's happening?

10:17.897 --> 10:20.525
Back! Get back.

10:38.318 --> 10:41.151
Back to the ship, and move it!

10:55.902 --> 10:57.836
Snarf? Are you aII right?

10:58.004 --> 11:00.131
Come on, Snarf, say something.

11:04.210 --> 11:07.373
Good oId Snarf.
Why did you wanna scare me Iike that?

11:09.248 --> 11:11.409
How many of them did I get?

11:11.584 --> 11:13.415
Lion-O, you're not hurt.

11:13.953 --> 11:17.252
Snarf took a few Iumps,
but I managed to hoId them off.

11:17.490 --> 11:20.084
You did it with the sword?

11:20.426 --> 11:23.293
WeII, the sword kind of did it for me.

11:25.531 --> 11:26.759
I see.

11:27.633 --> 11:29.794
How bad is it, Panthro?

11:29.969 --> 11:32.733
WeII, I patched up the hoIe,
and I guess it's okay.

11:32.905 --> 11:36.671
The navigationaI system is pretty weII shot.
We can maneuver some...

11:36.843 --> 11:39.869
...but not enough to get to the gaIaxy
we were headed for.

11:40.046 --> 11:42.446
The best we can do is this.

11:43.316 --> 11:47.047
-Not much as gaIaxies go.
-It's dinky, is what it is.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.047
See this puny IittIe sun?

11:50.289 --> 11:55.556
I've run a gaIactic scan for atmospheric
compatibiIity, and this bIue pIanet...

11:55.962 --> 12:00.058
...the third one out,
gives me a readout of 96 percent.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.591
Atmospheric com-- Com--

12:02.769 --> 12:05.602
That means we couId breathe the air,
Lion-O.

12:05.772 --> 12:08.263
Even so, it's Iight-years away.

12:09.976 --> 12:13.503
We'd have to make the trip
in the suspension capsuIes.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.781
You wiII aII get
in the suspension capsuIes now.

12:16.949 --> 12:19.713
I wiII piIot the ship to the bIue pIanet.

12:20.119 --> 12:24.055
No, Jaga. Without suspension, you'II die.

12:24.223 --> 12:26.214
We can set the course on robot piIot.

12:26.392 --> 12:31.125
In its damaged condition, the ship must be
piIoted manuaIIy as Iong as possibIe...

12:31.297 --> 12:33.959
...or we can't be sure
of reaching our destination.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.459
We can't be sure anyway.

12:36.636 --> 12:40.936
We'II take our chances together.
You must join us in the capsuIes, Jaga.

12:41.107 --> 12:42.574
Yes, Jaga. PIease.

12:42.742 --> 12:44.073
Enough.

12:44.243 --> 12:46.711
I am by far the oIdest of you.

12:46.879 --> 12:51.407
Even though the suspension capsuIes sIow
down the aging process tremendousIy...

12:51.851 --> 12:54.081
...some aging does take pIace.

12:54.253 --> 12:58.622
Even in suspension, I couId not Iive
Iong enough to compIete the journey.

12:59.358 --> 13:00.757
Enter the capsuIes.

13:01.227 --> 13:03.092
But Jaga--

13:03.262 --> 13:08.097
Come, Cheetara. What Jaga says is true.
Don't make it tougher for him.

13:08.267 --> 13:12.897
Yeah, he's just being practicaI.

13:13.372 --> 13:17.536
AII right, if we're gonna do it, Iet's do it.

13:17.710 --> 13:19.905
In you go, Snarf. No staIIing.

13:20.079 --> 13:22.411
I'm going, I'm going.

13:23.516 --> 13:25.746
See you aII Iater, I hope.

13:25.918 --> 13:28.546
Goodbye, Jaga.

13:28.721 --> 13:30.951
You must be brave, Lion-O.

13:31.124 --> 13:32.455
It is your duty.

13:32.925 --> 13:35.325
Yes, Jaga.

13:36.596 --> 13:40.327
The Eye of Thundera
wiII be waiting for you...

13:40.500 --> 13:42.468
...when you reach your new home.

13:57.717 --> 14:02.620
I wish I were as sure of their chances
as I pretended to be.

14:02.788 --> 14:06.280
StiII, there is a chance.

14:13.332 --> 14:16.995
I can't go on.

14:17.270 --> 14:18.828
I pray...

14:19.005 --> 14:20.836
...the robot piIot...

14:21.007 --> 14:23.475
...can take it from here.

15:29.542 --> 15:32.875
I just knew I wasn't going to Iike this.

15:33.913 --> 15:35.938
Lion-O.

15:36.115 --> 15:37.412
Lion-O.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.714
Lion-O? It's him.

15:50.930 --> 15:54.764
Wake up, Lion-O. It's me. It's oId Snarf.

15:54.934 --> 15:57.630
What are you doing, Snarf? Get away.

15:58.170 --> 15:59.728
What in the--?

15:59.905 --> 16:02.169
Oh, the suspension capsuIe.

16:02.341 --> 16:04.673
But how did it get to be so smaII?

16:05.077 --> 16:09.173
I was reaIIy worried, Lion-O.
I was sure it was aII going to turn out--

16:09.348 --> 16:11.612
You Iook a Iot smaIIer too, Snarf.

16:11.784 --> 16:13.718
What's going on?

16:14.854 --> 16:18.654
And my hands, Iook at the size of them.

16:19.058 --> 16:23.620
<i>Even though the suspension capsules</i>
<i>slow down the aging process...</i>

16:23.796 --> 16:27.254
<i>...some aging does take place.</i>

16:27.433 --> 16:29.264
Why, I'm grown.

16:33.272 --> 16:35.797
Look what I have for you.

16:36.275 --> 16:38.334
What's this, Snarf? A toy?

16:38.511 --> 16:41.344
Good grief, I'm too big for toys.
Can't you see that?

16:43.082 --> 16:47.985
I guess you'II just aIways Iook IittIe
to faithfuI oId Snarf.

16:48.387 --> 16:52.847
Lion-O, Iook out! The mutants are back.

17:05.805 --> 17:10.242
Mutants? They Iook Iike--
I don't know, Iike I shouId remember them.

17:10.710 --> 17:12.575
They're reaI bad, Lion-O.

17:12.744 --> 17:16.771
I just knew we hadn't seen
the Iast of that bunch.

17:19.251 --> 17:22.778
What the go darn--? Lion-O, Iook.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.515
-You want the mutants to hear?
-But....

17:33.733 --> 17:35.792
Good grief, what's the matter with you?

17:35.968 --> 17:40.234
We're in big troubIe here, and you bring me
another stupid toy? Get away.

17:40.473 --> 17:41.997
Search carefuIIy.

17:42.174 --> 17:46.440
The Eye of Thundera must be
in the wreckage somewhere.

17:46.612 --> 17:48.136
Over here.

17:48.314 --> 17:50.908
One of the Thundercats
is stiII in his capsuIe.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.108
And here's another.

17:54.220 --> 17:58.589
We'II never have a better chance
to be rid of them forever.

17:59.392 --> 18:01.292
No. Stop!

18:01.927 --> 18:03.326
And who is that?

18:03.696 --> 18:05.129
What does it matter?

18:05.297 --> 18:08.733
The question wiII soon be
''Who was that?''

18:33.058 --> 18:35.959
This sword. I know this sword.

18:36.128 --> 18:39.894
It's-- Oh, I can't remember. It's....

18:40.065 --> 18:41.362
Lion-O.

18:41.534 --> 18:45.368
Jaga? Is it reaIIy you?
You're stiII with me?

18:45.771 --> 18:49.036
I wiII aIways be with you, Lion-O.

18:49.208 --> 18:53.577
Pay heed, for it is your destiny
that you hoId in your hand...

18:53.746 --> 18:55.873
...the Eye of Thundera...

18:56.115 --> 18:59.380
...the source of the Thundercats' power.

18:59.552 --> 19:01.042
Yes, I remember.

19:01.220 --> 19:04.280
Sight beyond sight.

19:13.132 --> 19:16.863
In those capsuIes, they're--
They're Thundercats.

19:22.074 --> 19:27.910
Thunder, thunder, thunder,
Thundercats, ho!

19:33.986 --> 19:36.682
The Thundercats, they're Ioose.

19:47.333 --> 19:50.427
We're gonna Ioosen
your bones for you too.

19:59.612 --> 20:03.275
Tygra, Iook who's joined us.

20:03.449 --> 20:05.940
Grown some, hasn't he?

20:07.052 --> 20:10.112
So, what's the big deaI about height?

20:11.156 --> 20:13.283
-My eyes.
-Back.

20:13.459 --> 20:16.860
TeIeport yourseIves back to the ships.

20:25.504 --> 20:29.941
The mutants wiII never rest untiI

20:30.142 --> 20:32.838
That wiII never happen, I'II see to it.

20:33.379 --> 20:35.142
Get him.

20:35.314 --> 20:39.011
One tiny skirmish,
and he's suddenIy a superhero.

20:39.184 --> 20:41.049
Now, now.

20:41.220 --> 20:44.621
-He did pretty good for his first time out.
-He did indeed.

20:44.790 --> 20:48.658
And a fine figure of a Thundercat

20:48.827 --> 20:50.488
And so handsome too.

20:50.663 --> 20:55.896
Snarf didn't do anything, of course.
Just found the sword, that's aII.

20:57.303 --> 21:01.501
Now we'II have to go about seeing
if we can survive in this pIace.

21:01.674 --> 21:04.871
We wiII survive
and create a mighty new empire.

21:05.044 --> 21:09.413

21:15.054 --> 21:16.715
With your heIp, of course.

21:19.158 --> 21:21.683
WeII, maybe it'II turn out aII right...

21:21.860 --> 21:24.727
...and maybe it won't.
