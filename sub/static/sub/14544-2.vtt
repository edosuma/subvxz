00:32.785 --> 00:35.527
Thanks, next!

01:08.988 --> 01:11.628
Thanks, next!

02:02.175 --> 02:04.849
Today I'm...

02:04.944 --> 02:07.891
Today I'm...

02:07.980 --> 02:09.960
Tomorrow I'm...

02:10.049 --> 02:11.687
Tomorrow I'm...

03:09.375 --> 03:10.115
Wow!

03:11.477 --> 03:12.217
Hello!

03:18.920 --> 03:22.160
LEARN  THE  LANGUAGE

03:40.406 --> 03:44.513
There, now we've got
fresh cinnamon buns.

03:50.917 --> 03:53.329
Really.

03:54.954 --> 03:59.061
I'm not quite following.
You can't hate a spice.

03:59.158 --> 04:02.162
- No.
- One can hate murders and Hitler...

04:02.261 --> 04:05.071
You sure can hate Hitler.
But cinnamon buns?

04:10.269 --> 04:13.978
Honey, that's a great name
for the club!

04:14.073 --> 04:15.916
Gustaf is opening a...

06:31.310 --> 06:32.186
What happened?

06:35.848 --> 06:37.657
What's going on, Birger?

06:37.750 --> 06:39.923
The young ones broke the bed!

06:40.019 --> 06:42.329
- No?
- Too bad.

07:04.443 --> 07:09.324
Don't you ever feel like you and Dad
want some alone time?

07:09.415 --> 07:13.659
Maybe go to the movies or something,
just the two of you?

07:15.855 --> 07:18.267
Birger and I?

07:18.357 --> 07:22.669
- No. Do you want to get rid of us?
- No, that's not what I meant.

07:23.529 --> 07:28.171
It's just, like, we live so close
to each other now.

07:29.235 --> 07:31.511
Dad and I haven't been
to the movies together

07:31.604 --> 07:35.882
since we saw that movie
about ghosts...

07:35.975 --> 07:37.545
what's it called...

07:37.643 --> 07:40.021
Are you talking about
"The Sixth Sense" now?

07:41.447 --> 07:44.656
That was really a long time ago.

07:45.918 --> 07:51.027
No, it's not the same as it was before.

07:54.994 --> 07:56.667
How was it before?

07:56.762 --> 07:59.208
Your Dad was so handsome...

07:59.298 --> 08:00.368
and tall...

08:00.466 --> 08:06.075
and had a captain's hat.

08:06.172 --> 08:10.518
He was so sexy.

08:10.609 --> 08:12.953
So handsome.

08:15.414 --> 08:17.758
- Mom...
- Where is that hat now?

08:20.152 --> 08:22.792
Stop it now!

08:39.839 --> 08:41.045
Thanks!

08:44.610 --> 08:46.021
We are going to pick
some blueberries for a pie.

08:46.111 --> 08:48.387
- Do you want to join us?
- Oh, yes.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.256
Blueberries seem wonderful!

09:13.839 --> 09:16.115
- I love you.
- I love you.

09:21.046 --> 09:22.821
- Should we get going?
- Yes.

09:28.921 --> 09:30.298
Stop it.

12:13.619 --> 12:15.496
What are you doing?

12:15.587 --> 12:17.157
Nothing.

12:27.032 --> 12:28.340
Hello!

12:37.042 --> 12:39.989
We have to go now.

17:45.617 --> 17:47.563
I know we have a rental contract,

17:47.652 --> 17:49.097
but I just want
to access the apartment

17:49.187 --> 17:51.827
two or three days earlier.

17:56.061 --> 18:00.009
Well, because we are three grown-ups
living in a small summer house, okay?

18:00.832 --> 18:05.338
You obviously haven't met my Mom.
She can drive anyone mad...

18:05.937 --> 18:07.780
with her charm.

18:58.690 --> 19:03.139
Well, now you don't have to live
in that small summer house.

19:03.228 --> 19:06.698
Mom, that's not what I meant,
and you know it.

19:06.798 --> 19:10.143
I understand you need
some alone time.

19:10.235 --> 19:12.841
We did, too...

19:12.938 --> 19:15.942
a hundred years ago.

19:16.041 --> 19:18.351
- Sleep well!
- Good night. Thanks for today.

19:18.443 --> 19:19.683
Thanks.

19:58.583 --> 19:59.755
It must be on!

19:59.851 --> 20:01.489
Shouldn't we try without
just one time?

20:01.586 --> 20:04.032
Come on now!

20:44.162 --> 20:46.608
...now I want to sleep with you.
