['80s hip-hop song playing]

00:13.972 --> 00:18.268
That was a song I didn't pay for,
because I am Harris Burrows,

00:18.351 --> 00:20.854
Seattle's onliest
pirate radio practitioner.

00:20.937 --> 00:23.022
-[telephone ringing]
-The best to DIY it

00:23.106 --> 00:25.150
since Christian Slater.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.944
Ahoy-hoy. We've got a caller.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.738
Caller, go!

00:29.988 --> 00:35.785
-[man]<i> Whoo! Harris! You rock!</i>
-As do you, brother. We should party.

00:36.161 --> 00:40.832
How's tonight? My place?
And you know what? Bring everyone.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.000
[crowd cheering audio plays]

00:42.083 --> 00:47.297
And what the hell. For the 27th time
in a row, let's make it '80s-themed.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.676
-Harris, out.
-[music playing]

01:01.811 --> 01:04.355
Harris! What up?

01:09.944 --> 01:14.324
Begging your pardon, milady,
but I believe you're off-theme.

01:14.699 --> 01:17.952
You said '80s.
You never specified the century.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.454
I stand corrected.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.289
[woman] Bring 'em in.

01:27.086 --> 01:28.755
[Burrows] I don't mind your ex showing up.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.591
Can he at least make an effort
to look like he doesn't want to murder me?

01:32.091 --> 01:34.552
Didn't he get the memo? People love me.

01:37.305 --> 01:41.184
Last question. By your own account,
you've had a checkered past.

01:41.267 --> 01:45.063
So, what's the difference between
who you were then and who you are now?

01:46.272 --> 01:48.775
You held that one
until I was half a bottle deep.

01:50.276 --> 01:54.155
Now? I'm needed. I'm appreciated.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.742
People stop me on the street
just to shake my hand,

01:59.160 --> 02:01.371
and that kind of thing never happened
to the man I was before.

02:02.163 --> 02:03.164
It's not bad.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.711
So, what's next? Politics?

02:08.837 --> 02:09.963
[laughs]

02:10.755 --> 02:13.633
-Do I really seem that depraved?
-Mmm...

02:13.883 --> 02:15.009
Jury's out.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.846
Speaking of depravity and politics,

02:18.638 --> 02:20.431
word around the campfire is
that Mayor Baracus

02:20.515 --> 02:23.226
was a frequent guest of yours
at The Scratching Post.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.396
What happened to "last question"?

02:27.021 --> 02:29.274
Yeah. The man liked to party.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.151
You know who killed him?

02:31.568 --> 02:35.071
I wish I did. Baracus left a huge tab.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.282
Whoever did owes me.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.577
If I may turn the tables for a sec,

02:40.660 --> 02:43.830
are we ever gonna be anything more
than just journalist-subject?

02:44.581 --> 02:46.749
Well, I turn in the story on Thursday.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.710
You won't be my subject after that.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.462
Great. Thursday, then.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.883
Say 8:00? Bring an appetite.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.051
-You cooking?
-Food?

02:57.594 --> 02:58.845
I hadn't considered it.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.680
Yeah.

03:01.222 --> 03:04.309
Sure. Why not.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.439
Someone's blocking me in.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.816
[Blaine] Yeah.
It's the brat from next door.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.570
Always trying to out-soiree me.
Hang tight.

-[indistinct conversations]

03:23.411 --> 03:25.038
Yo, there's someone at the door.

03:25.246 --> 03:28.875
You're killing me, Hamm-bone.
You know this is a party, right?

03:28.958 --> 03:31.127
You know I hate
your punny little nicknames, right?

03:31.210 --> 03:33.713
Do you find them too Hamm-fisted?

03:34.422 --> 03:36.299
It's some old dude. He seems pissed.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.182
Hi. Is this your party?

03:44.474 --> 03:45.850
And I'll cry if I want to.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.353
Great. I'm gonna need the owner
of the black Jeep

03:48.436 --> 03:50.855
to go ahead and move it
from in front of my driveway.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.566
Mmm-mmm-hmm.
Lot of people here, old timer.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.860
You're asking me to find
a Jeep in a haystack.

03:55.944 --> 03:59.239
If you really gotta get somewhere,
I suggest a cab.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.367
You can bill me. I'm good for it.

04:07.038 --> 04:10.124
Let's try this again.
Perhaps I should introduce myself--

04:10.208 --> 04:13.044
No, no, no. I know who you are, man.
You used to play Doogie Howser.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.003
[laughter]

04:14.087 --> 04:17.507
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
You know what I enjoy?

04:18.800 --> 04:22.553
Killing people who piss me off.
And that's not hyperbole.

04:23.346 --> 04:27.475
If you don't get that car moved,
I will literally end your life.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.560
Nod if you understand.

04:33.982 --> 04:34.899

Now, these brains have to
go directly into the tubes,

05:26.034 --> 05:28.328
not the mixing vats. Are we clear?

05:29.078 --> 05:32.832
I've worked at the plant since day one.
I know what I'm doing.

Hey.

06:04.989 --> 06:05.865
Hey.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.076
Hey, what are you doing?

06:08.618 --> 06:09.911
Hey, let me out!

06:10.286 --> 06:13.956
Hey. Hey, let me out! Hey!

06:14.332 --> 06:17.960
I'm a little foggy on the details,
but she heads to D.C. on Friday.

06:18.086 --> 06:21.255
If anyone can talk the Pentagon
out of nuking us, it's Peyton.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.341
Are we going in circles?

06:23.424 --> 06:25.676
We've passed four bedrooms,
three bathrooms,

06:25.760 --> 06:30.181
an arcade room, a darkroom,
and a radio room, but no steam room.

06:30.598 --> 06:31.682
Oh...

06:31.974 --> 06:36.062
This might be my dream house.
I wonder what his parents do.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.814
[Harris] This isn't his parents' place.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.526
Victim is Harris Burrows, 19.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.278
Mom's deceased,
Dad lives outside the wall.

06:44.362 --> 06:47.532
The kid was independently wealthy.
This place is his.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.243
Body's down there.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.914
Oh. Watch your step.
Somebody spilled slippery nipple.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.458
Thanks.

06:59.293 --> 07:02.880
Severe hyperthermia.
Poor kid was cooked alive.

07:02.964 --> 07:06.467
Screwed the door shut, sealed him in.
What an awful way to go.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.344

-[thudding]

07:12.390 --> 07:14.475
Hold up, hold up.

07:14.851 --> 07:19.188
[groans] So, anyone this rich,
you've got to assume money's a motive.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.483
Clive, you may have a fractured vertebra.

07:22.567 --> 07:26.737
You can't keep detective-ing through
a broken back. You're not Batman.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.698
You don't know that.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.199
[groaning]

07:31.367 --> 07:33.411
Eileen. Who's that?

07:33.744 --> 07:37.498
Amy O'Neill, victim's girlfriend.
Came over this morning and found him.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.209
She claims last night a neighbor,
some old guy, came by,

07:40.293 --> 07:42.420
complained about the party,
and threatened Harris' life.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.133
Which neighbor?
Can you guys wheel me over?

07:47.592 --> 07:52.221
No, no. No one's wheeling you anywhere.
You need medical attention. We'll go.

07:53.222 --> 07:57.518
Liv's an OG zombie.
I once took a kickboxing class, yeah?

07:57.602 --> 07:58.811
Between the two of us,
I think we can handle

07:58.895 --> 08:00.480
some doddering old crank.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.647
[doorbell ringing]

08:07.653 --> 08:10.865
And they say nobody just drops by anymore.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.619
Did you threaten
your neighbor's life last night?

08:14.702 --> 08:19.081
I sure did. He was being, um... Insolent.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.959
Well, he's dead now. So...

08:22.335 --> 08:25.171
You're under arrest for murder.

08:33.012 --> 08:34.931
Of course I don't seem upset.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.850
I abhorred that kid.
Doesn't mean I killed him.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.229
Well, it doesn't mean you didn't, either.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.565
Now wait a minute.

08:44.649 --> 08:49.362
From a strictly rhetorical standpoint,
I believe you're correct. He's good.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.240
You realize that I'm going to eat
the murder victim's brain, right?

08:52.323 --> 08:53.866
I'll find out if you killed him.

08:53.950 --> 08:57.870
So, the brain's still in his skull.
That really sound like my style to you?

08:57.954 --> 08:59.664
[Ravi] You're a teen murderer, Blaine.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.249
That's exactly your style.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.875
Either way, what difference does it make?

09:03.167 --> 09:05.044
We all know you can't lock me up.

09:05.127 --> 09:08.589
Not when I'm the only thing
keeping the city's zombies from starving.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.551
I'm untouchable.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.470
Guess again.
If you did this, you will pay for it.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.764
-Will I, though?
-Yeah, you will.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.058
Yeah, but... Will I?

09:19.141 --> 09:21.310
-[footsteps approaching]
-Ah.

09:21.602 --> 09:25.147
There she is.
Al Bronson of <i>Bluster </i>magazine.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.650
Meet Liv and Ravi from the Seattle PD.

09:27.733 --> 09:30.236
They just popped by to
see if I committed a murder.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.488
We do this every few months.

09:32.572 --> 09:36.909
Al is short for Alice. And alibi.

09:37.285 --> 09:40.454
She was here all night
and can confirm that so, too, was I.

09:40.788 --> 09:43.249
-Is that true?
-Yep.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.714
You'll show yourselves out?

09:52.466 --> 09:57.805
Sir, with all due respect, rumors persist
on anti-zombie message boards

09:57.888 --> 10:02.101
that CHICS is planning
a coordinated blockade

10:02.184 --> 10:03.686
of our dispensaries.

10:03.769 --> 10:08.149
If this comes to pass,
how do we intend to respond?

10:08.899 --> 10:10.026
Machetes.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.486
Hand grenades.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.157
-Excellent, Commander.
-That was a joke.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.493
We'll have Lieutenant Collins
prep the trucks

10:19.577 --> 10:22.955
for mobile brain tube delivery.
And I'll get Captain...

10:24.624 --> 10:26.917
Um... Uh...

10:28.502 --> 10:29.629
Uh...

10:29.712 --> 10:31.631
-Hobbs?
-Hobbs, yes.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.924
I'll get him to draw up
prospective routes, and--

10:34.008 --> 10:36.052
<i>Mon dieu,</i> this is our food supply.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.055
Any attempt to interfere
with zombies receiving

10:39.138 --> 10:41.724
that which sustains us
must be put down by force.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.726
An example must be made.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.103
How about we don't seek out confrontation?

10:46.896 --> 10:49.774
If the intel changes, we can reassess.

10:59.825 --> 11:00.910
[timer dings]

11:13.339 --> 11:14.632
Why so glum, chum?

11:17.760 --> 11:21.389
-Aw, Isobel.
-Paragraph four.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.603
[Liv] "Her mother, however,
finds a silver lining in Isobel's death

11:27.686 --> 11:30.773
from Freylich Syndrome.
Her death saved a life.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.234
Isobel's brain made a zombie human again."

11:34.568 --> 11:37.071
Oh, no. This isn't your fault, Ravi.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.990
You worked hard
so that this wouldn't become public.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.993
Didn't think to warn Isobel's mom,
though, did I?

11:43.369 --> 11:46.997
Now Freylich kids across the country
have a price on their head.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.083
CDC brass are going to
try to kill the story, but--

11:49.166 --> 11:52.294
[Liv] Okay, then. It's a local paper.
No one's gonna pick it up.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.339
How many brain dealers live in Boise?

11:57.508 --> 11:58.592
[sniffs]

12:01.178 --> 12:03.556
Knock, knock. Sorry to barge in.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.851
I thought you should know I'm not really
an alibi for Blaine last night.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.272
I did sleep there,
but only because my car was blocked in.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.190
We stayed in separate rooms.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.818
I have no idea if he got up in the middle
of the night to kill someone.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.697
While I'm here,
did I overhear you right earlier?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.157
Blaine's killed teens before?

12:22.783 --> 12:25.661
Oh. Ish. That was a metaphor.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.664
As I'm sure you know, once upon a time,
Blaine was a drug dealer.

12:28.747 --> 12:31.000
And, as we all know, drugs kill teens.

12:31.709 --> 12:32.918
That they do.

12:33.961 --> 12:37.465
You were the coroners who examined
Mayor Baracus when he was murdered, right?

12:39.341 --> 12:41.635
Wasn't Blaine under investigation
for that murder, too?

12:43.095 --> 12:45.723
Only because Baracus
was always at Blaine's club.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.058
Blaine was never linked
to the murder itself.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.143
Hmm.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.770
Okay.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.190
Thank you for your time.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.658
[footsteps receding]

13:06.368 --> 13:10.289
-I told you Blaine killed Baracus.
-I told you I thought so, too.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.541
-That means he also stole my cures.
-Probably.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.835
But unless you want all the brains
to stop coming into Seattle,

13:14.919 --> 13:16.670
there's nothing you can do about it.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.633
-That's not how it's supposed to work.
-[sighs]

13:21.592 --> 13:26.180
Blaine lies, cheats, steals,
kills, and prospers.

13:27.181 --> 13:31.519
Meanwhile, I can't even prevent a bunch
of dying kids from being hunted like dogs.

13:31.602 --> 13:35.731
I'll be in my office, beating myself up
mentally and emotionally.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.109
What? What's that look?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.237
I'm hatching a scheme.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.867
-I'm not in the mood, Liv.
-I didn't ask. Because guess what?

13:47.284 --> 13:51.038
I know how to heal your Chakra, Barti.
We're gonna solve the case.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.374
First of all, there'll be no
further wordplay with my name.

13:53.457 --> 13:56.544
And second, I'm not really
in the mood to play cop right now.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.878
[exclaiming]

13:58.212 --> 14:00.506
You're gonna want in on this. Okay?

14:00.839 --> 14:03.926
Clive's out this week with his back.
And you know what that means?

14:04.009 --> 14:07.304
-That this is Cavanaugh's case.
-It means we can do whatever we want.

14:07.388 --> 14:10.266
Like police-harass the crap out of Blaine.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.477
We can get a warrant
for his big fancy house.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.853
We can ransack it.

14:14.937 --> 14:19.275
Can I be the guy that takes a knife
and rips into his couch cushions?

14:19.441 --> 14:23.404
Sure. And after that,
I'll pull him in for an interrogation,

14:23.946 --> 14:26.615
and you can beat him
with a phone book. You in?

14:26.991 --> 14:27.825
Fine.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.035
This is gonna be fun.

14:31.912 --> 14:32.997
[sniffles]

14:35.791 --> 14:37.251
Take your time.

14:39.628 --> 14:40.671
[cell phone vibrating]

14:44.049 --> 14:45.968
You know when you think
you have a great idea,

14:46.051 --> 14:48.554
and then you do it,
and it's not so great after all?

14:48.804 --> 14:51.891
-That's kinda what's happening here.
<i>-I see you.</i>

14:51.974 --> 14:55.436
I see you, too, big guy.
You got some pain meds, did you?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.813
<i>-Mmm-hmm.</i>
-You earned 'em.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.274
We're just interviewing
Harris' best friend, Hamm.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.484
-You want in?
<i>-Yes!</i>

15:04.612 --> 15:08.282
Hamm, this is Detective Babineaux.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.993
He'll be joining us.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.037
Okay.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.583
Hamm was just telling me how Harris
came to be independently wealthy so young.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.168
-Bitcoin.
<i>-Bitcoin?</i>

15:19.251 --> 15:20.377
[scoffs]

15:22.671 --> 15:25.049
Um... [clears throat] Yeah.

15:25.132 --> 15:29.637
Our freshman econ teacher
bought some to prove that it was a scam.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.180
Harris disagreed.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.058
So Mr. Mooney dared Harris

15:34.141 --> 15:36.602
to put his money where his mouth was,
and Harris did.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.605
He took the cash that he was saving up
to buy a car,

15:39.688 --> 15:41.482
went all-in on Bitcoin instead.

15:41.815 --> 15:44.485
Mooney cashed out early, made a few bucks.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.695
Harris cashed out at the peak.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.988
-Made a mint.
<i>-Ooh.</i>

15:48.072 --> 15:52.201
That's how life was for Harris.
Things just worked out for him.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.495
Except, you know, getting murdered.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.788
[Clive] <i>Ooh.</i>

15:55.996 --> 16:00.542
Can you think of anyone else
that might've wanted to do Harris harm?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.336
Well, the neighbor threatened to kill him.

16:02.419 --> 16:03.796
We're all over that one.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.507
-Anyone else?
-No.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.677
Everyone loved him.

16:11.595 --> 16:14.932
Except maybe Amy's ex, Jamie.

16:15.182 --> 16:18.936
Harris kind of stole her from him.
Jamie didn't take it so well.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.062
<i>Ooh.</i>

16:21.105 --> 16:22.147
<i>Ooh.</i>

16:22.231 --> 16:24.650
He have a last name or an address?

16:25.442 --> 16:27.695
Jamie Ross. I don't know where he lives,

16:27.778 --> 16:30.906
but there's a vigil
at the high school later today.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.283
Amy will be there,
so he probably will, too.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.205
Brain plant key-cards
do not just go missing.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.915
Find out who took them.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.960
Are we missing any brains?

16:45.462 --> 16:49.675
More tubes than normal? How can that be?
Just fix it.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.387
Sir. Field report for J sector.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.306
No suspicious human activity as of yet,

16:56.390 --> 16:58.726
but there has been
some odd zombie activity, sir.

16:58.809 --> 17:02.604
-What activity?
-Confusion, disorientation, memory loss.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.773
Reports are coming in
from across the city.

17:05.274 --> 17:10.487
One of my guys can't even do simple math,
like one digit addition. It's weird.

17:13.198 --> 17:19.538
How long before his memory lapse
did he last eat a brain tube?

17:20.039 --> 17:21.457
An hour, maybe?

17:21.999 --> 17:23.125
Huh.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.419
Inspector, are we just gonna
let CHICS get away

17:25.502 --> 17:27.004
with blockading our brain dispensaries?

17:27.463 --> 17:28.922
Perhaps not.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.300
Dismissed.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.066
[Hamm] I'm not sure
what happens after you die,

17:47.149 --> 17:48.484
but I'm sure wherever Harris is,

17:48.567 --> 17:51.945
he's partying hard,
cooking up his next big scheme,

17:52.029 --> 17:54.156
cheering up someone who needs cheering up.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.534
Hey, if the Freylich story
hasn't broken wide by now,

17:57.618 --> 17:58.869
it's not going to.

17:58.952 --> 18:01.955
So, buck up, buttercup.
You're bumming these kids out.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.166
We're at a memorial.

18:04.249 --> 18:07.711
And memorials are for celebrating
the lives of those you've lost.

18:07.795 --> 18:12.257
And sometimes also for interrogating
the jealous ex of the victim's girlfriend.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.267
Excuse me there, young fellow.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.812
You aren't a teacher here
by any chance, are you?

18:24.895 --> 18:26.730
I'm the Vice Principal, actually.
Lee Mooney.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.942
Mooney? I thought Mooney
was an econ teacher.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.527
Used to be.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.196
So we hear Harris had you to thank
for his cryptocurrency windfall.

18:34.279 --> 18:37.866
I decided that if I could be out-invested
by a 15-year-old,

18:37.950 --> 18:40.369
I shouldn't be teaching economics.
[snickering]

18:42.121 --> 18:44.748
We're with the Seattle PD.
We're looking for a Jamie Ross.

18:45.207 --> 18:48.127
Jamie, yeah, I saw him earlier.

18:49.711 --> 18:50.879
There he is.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.757
[Hamm] ...'cause he never wanted to let
anyone take themselves too seriously.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.676
Hey, Mr. Mooney, where you at?

18:57.386 --> 19:01.056
You remember the time
Harris put up a $1,000 prize

19:01.140 --> 19:03.142
for best impersonation of you?

19:10.399 --> 19:11.859
Thank you.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.905
Jamie, talk to me. What's going on?

19:17.156 --> 19:19.783
-Who are you?
-Jamie. Hi.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.995
I'm lead detective Moore
with the Seattle PD, and I...

19:24.663 --> 19:26.957
-Everything okay?
-I don't know.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.127
He was fine a half hour ago.
Now he says he doesn't know me.

19:32.754 --> 19:36.383
Jamie, I'm a doctor.
I'm gonna take a look at you, okay?

19:42.973 --> 19:44.474
All right. Stay right there, mate.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.440
Pupils appear normal.
No signs of head trauma,

19:51.857 --> 19:54.067
but if he's got an alibi,
we're not going to hear it tonight.

19:54.151 --> 19:57.446
-We should probably get him to a hospital.
-Can they help him? He's a zombie.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.699
Wait, isn't he your ex-boyfriend?

20:00.782 --> 20:05.579
As in, before you started dating Harris,
who, you know, isn't a zombie?

20:05.746 --> 20:08.040
-I used to be a zombie, too.
-Used to be?

20:08.540 --> 20:10.751
Harris got me
one of those black market cures.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.713
Harris and I were together
before the Aleutian Flu outbreak.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.173
The cure brought us back together.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.675
How long before taking the cure
did you break up with Jamie?

20:19.176 --> 20:22.179
A couple weeks. After I took the cure.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.932
[Liv] And that must've taken
your zombie boyfriend by surprise.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.099
What is that?

20:32.522 --> 20:35.108
Harris, I'm going to end you!

20:35.192 --> 20:36.318
[Burrows laughing]

20:37.027 --> 20:38.111
You're gonna get us killed.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.951
Harris painted those flames
on Mooney's car.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.120
I don't think he took Harris' pranks
as lightly as he let on.

20:47.204 --> 20:50.415
I mean, pardon my French,
but dude was pissed.

20:54.670 --> 20:55.504
[Enzo] Commander.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.842
I have an issue
that requires immediate attention.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.388
Hey... you.

21:07.557 --> 21:13.397
Guard gate requested we send them
six more soldiers.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.357
They called back later,

21:15.440 --> 21:18.944
asked for two additional soldiers.

21:19.569 --> 21:22.572
I cannot determine
how many to send them total.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.744
-I--
-That's six plus two.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.292
You figure that out.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.753
You know, I think I have.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.436
One doesn't catch dementia.
It's not like a cold.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.396
And zombies don't catch anything anyway.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.190

to avoid questioning? That's what I'd--

-Just send it to Clive.

-I don't work for Clive.
-You do, actually.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.013

23:21.108 --> 23:22.984
do that very thing?

when I got here.

Those grave robberies from the news?

24:09.489 --> 24:11.449
We assumed hungry zombies.

24:11.533 --> 24:15.620
But I looked up the records.
Alzheimer patients, every one.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.498
My guess? Humans poisoning
the zombie food supply.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.250
Dead Enders, I bet.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.963

the bad brains before there's a crisis.

Stevie Wonder, are there no depths
to your hidden talents?

27:58.301 --> 28:01.012
Not even
when I'm murderer bait, evidently.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.932
The only way the killer gets in
is through that door.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.393
I'm a zombie, and Ravi is heavily armed.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.437
With this.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.315
Which I have never used before.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.901

in this closet, keeping watch.

28:16.027 --> 28:16.903
Comforting.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.572

outside manning the perimeter.

28:19.656 --> 28:22.450
Nobody's getting to you.
You're doing great!

28:22.534 --> 28:24.536
Double-O Steven, nobody does it better.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.373
What if it's Blaine?

28:29.499 --> 28:30.417
Huh?

28:30.500 --> 28:33.670
What if it's not a teenager
or a middle-aged man?

28:33.753 --> 28:36.214
What if Blaine and his goons
walk through the door?

28:36.297 --> 28:38.675
-Trained killers.
-I'd forgotten about Blaine.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.510

28:50.770 --> 28:53.022
We're pretending Harris is still alive

Don't worry, it's under control.

Did I mean for Steve to get shot?
Of course not.

29:15.086 --> 29:18.089
Could the plan have gone better? Sure.
But ask yourself,

29:18.548 --> 29:21.509
-could it also have gone worse?
<i>-Yes! That's the point.</i>

29:22.260 --> 29:24.971
<i>Vampire Steve could be dead,</i>
<i>and the killer's still in the wind.</i>

29:28.600 --> 29:30.393
[Eileen] We got the shooter.

29:30.477 --> 29:33.521
Caught him climbing down a drainpipe
on the Victorian next door.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.524
Had this on him.

29:36.858 --> 29:39.569
-Ouch.
-Hamm!

29:39.652 --> 29:43.281
What'd you do, cut together old clips
of Harris' broadcasts?

29:43.364 --> 29:44.824
Yeah, we did.

29:46.409 --> 29:47.577
So Harris really is dead, then?

29:48.703 --> 29:50.497
[exhales] Well, at least there's that.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.415
-He was your best friend.
-I was his sidekick.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.501
Do you have any idea how exhausting it is

29:54.584 --> 29:56.544
being dragged along
on every one of his little pranks?

29:57.170 --> 29:58.004
Some, yes.

29:58.087 --> 29:59.881
[Hamm] Harris never took no for an answer.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.090
Like when he convinced me to steal

30:01.174 --> 30:03.009
golf carts from my dad's club
in the middle of the night

30:03.092 --> 30:04.469
and do donuts on the greens.

30:04.886 --> 30:08.223
When we got busted,
his dad laughed, wrote him a check.

30:08.723 --> 30:10.433
My parents took away my college fund.

30:10.517 --> 30:11.559
[groans]

30:12.310 --> 30:14.187
He could've easily paid for my tuition.

30:15.271 --> 30:17.273
Way less than what he paid for Amy's cure.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.859
But he wanted to keep me around
as his lackey.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.946
I was supposed to be visiting colleges
when the wall went up.

30:23.029 --> 30:24.906
I would've been out there
instead of in here.

-Got it.

[Ravi]<i> What'd you see?</i>

31:23.172 --> 31:24.883
Someone holding a giant sweepstakes check?

31:24.966 --> 31:27.719
Don E in a wig,
delivering a cure to Harris.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.929
So Don E stole them?

31:30.013 --> 31:32.307
It could've been Blaine,
and Don E was just the delivery boy.

31:35.143 --> 31:36.978
What haven't Blaine and I done?

31:37.061 --> 31:39.606
I got a million stories
where that came from.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.233
I got to tell you something.

31:42.942 --> 31:44.652
You know that kid who got murdered?

31:45.111 --> 31:46.154
Mmm.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.822
-That neighbor kid?
-Mmm.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.867
I ate some of his brain.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.286
No!

31:54.287 --> 31:59.042
Sure did. And I had a vision of
you delivering the zombie cure to him.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.921
-No.
-Mmm-hmm.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.632
And since you do Blaine's bidding,

32:05.715 --> 32:06.841
that means Blaine was selling the cure,

32:06.925 --> 32:10.136
and whoever was selling the cure
killed the mayor, so...

32:10.219 --> 32:11.179
The mayor?

32:11.554 --> 32:13.765
Blaine would never kill her.

32:13.848 --> 32:17.101
He loves her. They used to be a thing.

32:20.146 --> 32:22.357
Tell me more about Blaine
and Peyton Charles.

32:26.569 --> 32:28.863

having sex at Blaine's?

32:30.031 --> 32:31.157

Blaine DeBeers. Interesting life, I bet.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.057
I look forward to reading it.

32:56.599 --> 32:59.143
Posting it tonight.
All that's left is some housekeeping.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.688
Can I run a few things by you for comment?

33:03.272 --> 33:04.107
Of course.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.111
Did local authorities know of
Blaine's checkered past

33:08.194 --> 33:10.321
before asking him to
smuggle brains for the city?

33:14.450 --> 33:18.079
That was a Fillmore Graves decision,
but, yes, of course they did.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.039
He had the know-how.

33:20.707 --> 33:23.042
-So it was known he was a smuggler?
-Of course.

33:23.209 --> 33:25.211
-And a drug dealer before that?
-Yes.

33:26.587 --> 33:29.257
But, I mean, all of the good
that he's doing now kinda--

33:29.340 --> 33:31.384
-What about the murders?
-What?

33:32.176 --> 33:35.596
-Well, he murdered your boss, for one.
-That's a...

33:36.556 --> 33:37.974
That's a crazy accusation.

33:38.307 --> 33:41.602
Plus, a bunch of runaways, winos,
streetwalkers, you name it,

33:41.686 --> 33:43.896
all at a butcher shop he owned
called Meat Cute.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.774
We were forced to drop those charges

33:46.858 --> 33:49.527
because we didn't have
the evidence to convict. So...

33:50.403 --> 33:53.364
So were you sleeping with Blaine
at this time, or did that come later?

33:59.912 --> 34:03.583
All right, then. I think
that's all the confirmation I need.

34:06.753 --> 34:11.466
If you run a story
that says those things...

34:14.677 --> 34:18.639
10,000 zombies depend on
the brains Blaine delivers into the city.

34:20.558 --> 34:21.642

34:24.520 --> 34:28.691
Do you think he murdered the mayor
at least in part

34:29.067 --> 34:30.318
as a love letter to you?

34:32.945 --> 34:35.031
I mean, that's why
you're in charge around here, right?

34:39.535 --> 34:41.370
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

34:42.872 --> 34:43.706
Now.
