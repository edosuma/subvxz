00:11.520 --> 00:13.780
LET'S HAVE YOU PICK UP TRASH
OVER BY THE SNACK BAR.

00:13.880 --> 00:14.820
( GROANS ) AGAIN?

00:14.920 --> 00:16.700
DON'T WORRY,
THIS IS THE LAST TIME

00:16.800 --> 00:18.660
YOU'LL BE ON TRASH DUTY
FOR A WHILE.

00:18.760 --> 00:21.420
AWESOME. WAIT, WE'RE NOT GETTING
ANOTHER INTERN, ARE WE?

00:21.520 --> 00:23.520
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN HANDLE

00:22.600 --> 00:23.860
ANOTHER SPY SITUATION.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.740
NO, I'VE ACTUALLY GOT
SOME PRETTY BIG NEWS

00:26.840 --> 00:29.080
ABOUT YOUR
DOMEâESTIC SITUATION.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.080
HOPEFULLY IT WON'T CAUSE
TOO MUCH PANâDOMEâMONIUM.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.920
"DOME" YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

00:38.480 --> 00:39.620
NO ONE, HUH?

00:39.720 --> 00:41.620
WELL, SINCE I HAVE TO
SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU,

00:41.720 --> 00:43.740
MAELARD'S DECIDED TO SEAL OFF
THE PARK IN A DOME

00:43.840 --> 00:45.620
TO CREATE
A CONTAINED ECOSYSTEM.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.720
A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS
FROM THE GOVERNMENT

00:47.280 --> 00:49.100
IS GONNA STUDY IT
FOR A WHOLE MONTH!

00:49.200 --> 00:51.380
BRO, HOW WOULD WE EVER
HAVE GUESSED THAT?

00:51.480 --> 00:53.620
A WHOLE MONTH?
WHERE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GO?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.720
YOU'LL HAVE TO
MOVE OUT.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.800
THE DOME'S
DROPPING TOMORROW.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.500
ISN'T THAT EXCITING?

00:57.600 --> 01:00.340
WHY AREN'T YOU MORE UPSET
ABOUT THE INCONVENIENCE?

01:00.440 --> 01:02.440
BECAUSE I DON'T
LIVE AT THE PARK.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.540
SO, WE CAN STAY
AT YOUR PLACE?

01:03.640 --> 01:06.580
( CHUCKLES )
WELL...MY PLACE,

01:06.680 --> 01:08.740
WHILE OFFICIALLY
A ONE BEDROOM,

01:08.840 --> 01:11.100
( WIND GUSTING )
FEELS MORE LIKE A STUDIO.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.200
SO, THERE ISN'T REALLY
ANY ROOM ââ

01:16.920 --> 01:18.820
IT'S NOT TOMORROW,
IT'S TODAY!

01:18.920 --> 01:20.580
THEY'RE SEALING
THE PARK TODAY!

01:53.400 --> 01:54.460
( ALL SHOUTING )

01:54.560 --> 01:55.540
IT'S NOT FAIR!

01:55.640 --> 01:58.860
HEY, GUYS,
LET'S RELAX, OKAY?

01:58.960 --> 02:02.140
LIKE I SAID, THEY'RE NOT
SEALING THE DOME TILL TOMORROW.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.820
ARE YOU BLIND, MAN?

02:03.920 --> 02:06.780
CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT THE DOME
HAS BEEN SEALED TODAY?

02:06.880 --> 02:09.380
CALM DOWN.
LOOK, HERE COMES MAELARD NOW.

02:09.480 --> 02:11.480
I'M SURE HE'LL
CLEAR THIS WHOLE THING UP.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.520
( Muffled ) MAELARD.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.260
OH. OKAY.

02:18.360 --> 02:19.460
( CELLPHONE RINGS )

02:19.560 --> 02:21.180
MAELARD.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.980
SO, THE TEST RUN'S LOOKING
PRETTY SUCCESSFUL ON OUR END.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.220
GOOD FIT.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.700
YEP, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
IN GOOD SHAPE FOR TOMORROW.

02:29.800 --> 02:30.940

SEE?

02:31.040 --> 02:32.020
SO, YOU CAN ALL ââ

02:32.120 --> 02:33.940
( CELLPHONE RINGING )

02:34.040 --> 02:35.420
MAELARD AGAIN.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.260
BENSON SPEAKING.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.600
OH, BUT I DON'T
GET DATES WRONG.

02:43.240 --> 02:48.280
AND THE DOME IS GONNA STAY WHERE
IT IS FOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.060
( CELLPHONE BEEPS )

02:56.160 --> 02:57.620
SO...

02:57.720 --> 02:59.500
WE FIGURED IT OUT.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.500
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

03:00.600 --> 03:02.600
( ALL SHOUTING )

03:04.600 --> 03:06.620
GOT THE DATE WRONG?

03:06.720 --> 03:10.060
BUT I'M ME, BENSON.

03:10.160 --> 03:13.100
EMERGENCY MEETING,
MY OFFICE, NOW!

03:13.200 --> 03:15.340
SO, I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.820
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SURVIVE
IN A DOME FOR A MONTH.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.500
TO LOOK AT THE EâMAIL
I GOT FROM THE DOME GUYS

03:21.600 --> 03:23.860
AND PROVE I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THE DROP DATE.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.340
( ALL GROAN )

03:25.440 --> 03:27.700
YOU WON'T BE GROANING
WHEN YOU SEE THIS.

( LOUD THUD )

03:29.240 --> 03:30.500
( ALL GROAN )

03:30.600 --> 03:32.600
IT'S OKAY. I'VE GOT
A PRINTED BACKUP VERSION.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.460
THAT'S NOT
WHAT WE'RE MAD ABOUT.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.660
YOU REALLY PRINT
EVERY EâMAIL?

03:36.760 --> 03:39.220
YES, I DO FOR THIS EXACT
TYPE OF SITUATION.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.320
SO, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN MAKE
FUN OF ME,

03:40.800 --> 03:42.060
BECAUSE I WAS PREPARED.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.500
YEP, YOU CAN'T CUT OFF THE POWER
TO MY PHYSICAL MAIL,

03:44.600 --> 03:46.540
OR AS I CALL IT,
MY PâMAIL.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.340
WE DON'T CARE.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.540
IS YOUR PâMAIL GONNA FEED US
FOR A MONTH?

ABOUT THE DATE.

NOW CAN YOU PLEASE
JUST HELP US?

04:00.880 --> 04:02.660
WE REALLY NEED LEADERSHIP
RIGHT NOW.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.100
NO, THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.780
IT'S ALL WRONG.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.740
DO NOT GO INTO
THE BATHROOM.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.620

A MUCH FINER TOOTH THAN MINE.

TO BOOT.

TO MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.700
I'VE BEEN SO BLIND.

04:55.800 --> 05:00.460

PRETTY SHARP.

KEEP THINGS RATIONED,

FOR THE MONTH.

BUT IN THE DOME ââ

THEY'RE FOR PLANTING, DUDE.

WHY THEY'RE UNSALTED.

DON'T BELIEVE ME.

HEY, UH,
SO I WAS THINKING,

05:40.640 --> 05:43.020
WE SHOULD WRITE UP A FULL
INVENTORY OF THESE SUPPLIES.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.260
COME BACK WITH US
TO THE CAMP,

09:21.360 --> 09:23.520
AND WE'LL SET YOU UP A HAMMOCK
IN THE MEDITATION TENT.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.420
I DON'T NEED
YOUR PITY HAMMOCKS.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.940
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

09:27.040 --> 09:29.140
WHY ARE YOU BEING
ALL WEIRD AND SUPPORTIVE?

DID THE DOME PEOPLE
GET TO YOU?

09:31.160 --> 09:31.980

09:37.480 --> 09:38.700
LET HIM GO.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.740

IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.540
THEY'LL SEE.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.460
THESE DOME GUYS
ARE UP TO SOMETHING,

09:44.560 --> 09:47.260
AND I'LL PROVE IT,
EVEN IF IT TAKES ALL MONTH.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.420

11:47.440 --> 11:49.440

11:50.160 --> 11:51.900
IT'S TRUE.
IT MUST ALL BE TRUE.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.460

12:06.120 --> 12:07.300
I DON'T CARE
WHO YOU ARE.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.780
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HERE.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.340
I CAN SEE YOU'VE
ACCURATELY SURMISED OUR PLANS.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.580
IS THAT MY PâMAIL?

12:20.680 --> 12:21.820
OUR PLANS HAVE SURELY

12:21.920 --> 12:23.740
BEEN MADE APPARENT TO YOU
BY THIS POINT ââ

12:23.840 --> 12:25.340
WHY WE PUT A DOME
OVER THE PARK

12:25.440 --> 12:27.100
AND PUMPED IT
FULL OF OXYGEN.

12:27.200 --> 12:30.220
WHY WE CREATED A SELFâSUSTAINING
ENVIRONMENT WITHIN IT.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.300
WHY WE SWITCHED THE DATE
ON YOUR EâMAIL.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.020
WHY WE ââ
AHA!!

12:34.120 --> 12:36.740
SO, YOU ADMIT
YOU <i>DIDCHANGE THE DATES!</i>

12:36.840 --> 12:39.100

12:42.080 --> 12:43.780

OF COURSE WE DID.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.880
AS YOU KNOW,
THAT'S PART OF THE TEST.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.360
PERHAPS THE DATA
ISN'T AS COMPROMISED

12:48.960 --> 12:50.460
AS WE INITIALLY THOUGHT.

12:50.560 --> 12:53.140
YEAH, WAIT, WHAT <i>ARE</i>
ALL THESE BLUEPRINTS FOR?

12:53.240 --> 12:54.420

13:01.920 --> 13:02.860
WHAT THE?

13:02.960 --> 13:04.820
STEFFEN, COME ON.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.060
IT IS A VERY SIMPLE
USER INTERFACE.

13:07.160 --> 13:10.700
ANTIDOTE DART,
KNOCKOUT DART.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.520
REMEMBER WHAT I JUST SHOWED YOU
BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT.

13:14.680 --> 13:16.140
( GROANS )

13:16.240 --> 13:18.240

13:17.720 --> 13:20.040

TO FIND OUT.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.580
OH, BE CAREFUL UP THERE.
HOW YOU GUYS DOING?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.680
WELL, WE
JUST ABOUT FINISHED

13:26.720 --> 13:28.720
WITH THE NEW
IRRIGATION SYSTEM.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.780
GREAT. YOU GUYS ARE DOING
GREAT WORK.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.260
HERE. I DON'T WANT YOU GUYS
TO GET DEHYDRATED.

13:32.360 --> 13:33.300

13:33.400 --> 13:34.540

13:34.640 --> 13:36.820
THANK YOU.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.580
GOOD, YOU'RE BACK.
ANY LUCK?

13:38.680 --> 13:40.020
YEAH,
BAD LUCK.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.020
WE COULDN'T
FIND HIM.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.340
( SIPS )
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.780
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO?

13:43.880 --> 13:45.420
HMM...YEP, OKAY.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.980
LET'S ALL GO OUT
IN AN ORGANIZED SEARCH PARTY.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.120
HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND HIM
AND TALK TO HIM CALMLY.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.940
NOW, REMEMBER OUR MANTRA.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.980
Together: THE DOME AFFECTS
US ALL IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.380
GREAT. LET'S GO.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.740

PLEASE STICK TOGETHER.

WHERE...AM I?

14:10.800 --> 14:12.140
HE'S STILL UNSTABLE.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.580
BENSON,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:13.680 --> 14:15.680
WE FOUND YOU PASSED OUT
IN THE FOREST.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.180
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:16.280 --> 14:17.780
WHAT?
YEAH, I'M...

14:21.040 --> 14:22.780
REALLY COOL HEADBAND,
BENSON.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.740
SEEMS LIKE
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.060
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:26.160 --> 14:28.140
WELL (COUGHS)
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

14:28.240 --> 14:29.860
IâI WAS DOING
SOME RECON.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.120
ACTUALLY CAME ACROSS
SOME VERY EARTHâSHATTERING ââ

14:32.200 --> 14:35.300
HEY, HAS THAT MIRROR
ALWAYS BEEN THERE?

14:35.400 --> 14:37.220
OH, THAT OLD THING?
NEVER MIND THAT.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.380
NOW, YOU WERE SAYING
ABOUT YOUR TIME IN THE FOREST?

14:40.480 --> 14:41.860
YEAH, TELL US

14:50.120 --> 14:52.220
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
LIE BACK DOWN.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.260
WOULD YOU LIKE
A POPSICLE?

14:54.360 --> 14:56.340
SORRY, GUYS.

14:56.440 --> 14:59.020
THINK I'M STILL FEELING
A BIT RATTLED FROM EVERYTHING.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.220
SAY, REMEMBER THAT GAME
WE USED TO PLAY

15:01.320 --> 15:03.320
THAT ALWAYS MADE ME
REALLY COMFORTABLE

15:03.120 --> 15:04.460
AND LET MY GUARD DOWN?

15:04.560 --> 15:05.900
OF COURSE.
WHAT WAS IT AGAIN?

15:06.000 --> 15:09.620
THE CLOSE OUR EYES GAME
WHERE WE ALL CLOSE OUR EYES.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.460
I'M YOUR GIRLFRIEND

THERE MAY BE ANOTHER LAYER
OF DOME AROUND THIS ONE.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.500
EVERYBODY WEAPON UP.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.600
( SHING! )

19:57.720 --> 19:59.300
CONGRATULATIONS.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.420
MAELARD?

20:00.520 --> 20:02.300
YOU FINISHED
THE EXPERIMENT.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.820
BUT JUST BARELY.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.540
IF YOU'D ESCAPED
EVEN A MINUTE SOONER,

20:05.640 --> 20:07.640
WE'D HAVE HAD TO
START ALL OVER AGAIN.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.740
SO, THE PLAN WAS
TO TRAP US IN THERE

20:08.840 --> 20:10.500
WITH NO WARNING
ALL ALONG?

20:10.600 --> 20:13.420
I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO HARM
IN ADMITTING NOW THAT YES,

20:13.520 --> 20:15.460
I PLAYED YOU
FOR FOOLS AND WON.

20:15.560 --> 20:17.180
BUT WHY?

20:17.280 --> 20:19.280
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DIVULGE
THE GOAL OF THE EXPERIMENT.

20:19.240 --> 20:20.340
NO, MAELARD.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.220
YOU TELL US
WHAT THIS WAS ALL FOR.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.860
YOU TELL US RIGHT NOW!
TELL US!!

20:24.960 --> 20:26.260
AYEâYIâYIâYIâ
YIâYIâYIâYIâYI!

20:26.360 --> 20:27.820
ALL RIGHT!

20:27.920 --> 20:29.920
THE EXPERIMENT WAS A TEST
TO SEE HOW THE PARK

20:29.840 --> 20:32.580
AND ITS EMPLOYEES WOULD DO
IN A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.380
A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE?

20:34.480 --> 20:35.540
SERIOUSLY?

20:35.640 --> 20:37.460
THAT'S TOO COOL
TO BE TRUE.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.100
HE THINKS HE CAN
STILL PLAY US FOR FOOLS.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.420
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

20:41.520 --> 20:43.500
HOW MUCH WE'VE ALL GROWN
FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.300
THE TRUTH THIS TIME,
MAELARD.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.860
YOU OWE US THE TRUTH.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.140
I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH!

20:48.240 --> 20:49.940
PAPA, PLEASE.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.300
EH, FINE.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.780
I JUST FELT LIKE
BUYING A BIG DOME

20:53.880 --> 20:55.780
TO PUT ON THE PARK
BECAUSE I'M RICH.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.540
FINALLY ââ
AN HONEST ANSWER.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.820
I'D PROBABLY HAVE DONE
TWO DOMES.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.740
YOU KNOW, SO IT WOULD LOOK
LIKE A HUGE BUTT.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.500
WELL, BACK
TO MY MANSION.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.260
Benson: YOU'RE
NOT DONE HERE, MAELARD.

21:06.360 --> 21:07.540
THE EâMAIL.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.340
ADMIT TO EVERYONE
THAT YOU CHANGED THE DATE!

21:10.440 --> 21:12.340
YEAH,
I CHANGED THE DATE.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.740
SO, I WAS RIGHT,
EVERYONE!

21:14.840 --> 21:17.940
( LAUGHS MANIACALLY )

21:18.040 --> 21:20.120
I WAS RIGHT!!
