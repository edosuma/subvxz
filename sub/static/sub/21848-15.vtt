(THIS HEART'S ON FIRE
BY WOLF PARADE PLAYING)

00:08.676 --> 00:12.546
* Sometimes we rock and roll

00:12.613 --> 00:17.751
* Sometimes we stay at home,
and it's just fine

00:19.019 --> 00:21.055
* This heart's on fire

00:21.122 --> 00:22.790
* This heart's on fire

00:22.856 --> 00:25.326
* This heart's on fire

00:25.393 --> 00:27.528
* This heart's on fire

00:35.469 --> 00:37.638
* I am my mother's hen

00:37.705 --> 00:39.640
MAN: Please walk around
the other way.

00:39.707 --> 00:43.043
(PLAYING THROUGH HEADPHONES)
* And left the body in
the bed all day *

00:45.546 --> 00:47.148
What happened?
Nothing.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.717
They're just getting the lobby
ready for the big party.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.286
(MUSIC CONTINUES
THROUGH HEADPHONES)

00:52.353 --> 00:54.188
CLAIRE:
It's an annual fundraiser.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.923
Like a carnival?

00:55.989 --> 00:59.193
No, it's a swanky,
black-tie ball.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.929
You think a hospital
lobby is swanky?

01:01.995 --> 01:04.098
Not yet,
but add some lights,
a few decorations,

01:04.165 --> 01:05.666
and, most importantly,
alcohol...

01:05.733 --> 01:07.968
It becomes a streamer
and balloon-infested
hospital lobby

01:08.035 --> 01:09.203
with a cash bar.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.372
(SCOFFS)
It's for charity.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.341
Better to spend the money
for the cause.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.808
Actually, it's worse.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.777
You need to spend money
to make money.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.446
I don't like parties.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.182
Doesn't matter.
All residents will be
expected to attend

01:21.249 --> 01:22.916
and make a donation.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.084
This is Dr. Alex Park.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.353
He's the last
of Coyle's residents

01:25.419 --> 01:27.621
to be reassigned
to our team.

01:27.688 --> 01:31.359
Meet doctors Jared Kalu,
Claire Browne,
and Shaun Murphy.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.993
Nice to meet you.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.329
Welcome back.
How was Costa Rica?

01:35.396 --> 01:36.997
Beaches were awesome.
Monkeys were horrible.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.399
Little bastards stole
my new camera
and a pair of...

01:38.466 --> 01:40.134
How old are you?

01:40.201 --> 01:41.502
Forty-five.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.172
That's even older
than Dr. Melendez.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.640
DR. MELENDEZ: Dr. Murphy
is a talented doctor
who has autism,

01:46.707 --> 01:49.810
which sometimes
causes him to ask
inappropriate questions.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.879
No worries.
Inappropriate questions
can be very revealing.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.314
I'm a late bloomer.

01:53.381 --> 01:56.049
Park's being modest,
which is very unlike him.

01:56.116 --> 01:59.019
He was a cop for 15 years
before he went to med school.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.356
DR. MELENDEZ:
Now that we all
know each other,

02:02.423 --> 02:04.692
Reznick and Browne
have dibs on cases
this week.

02:04.758 --> 02:05.959
You make your picks?

02:06.026 --> 02:07.395
Yes.
Definitely.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.530
Is there karaoke?

02:09.597 --> 02:12.166
And now,
our all-star lineup!

02:12.233 --> 02:14.335
Playing center,
out of Moose Jaw,
Saskatchewan.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.036
Whoo!

02:16.103 --> 02:18.439
Spirit, stop it.
They don't have time
to fool around.

02:18.506 --> 02:19.707
I'm not fooling around.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.142
I need to document
the momentous event.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.244
Then at least
get it right.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.878
I'm from Taipei, Taiwan.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.814
SPIRIT:
Co-o-orrection!

02:26.880 --> 02:28.216
From Taipei, Taiwan,

02:28.282 --> 02:30.518
which I believe
is a suburb of Moose Jaw...

02:30.584 --> 02:31.919
Dr. Audrey Lim!

02:31.985 --> 02:33.887
* Bam, bam-bam, bawr *

02:33.954 --> 02:37.425
And assisting Dr. Lim
are

02:37.491 --> 02:39.427
two docs
I've never met.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.195
Hello.

02:41.262 --> 02:44.465
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy
from Casper, Wyoming.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.400
SPIRIT: And...

02:46.467 --> 02:49.203
Dr. Morgan Reznick,
Mill Valley, California.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.404
Represent!

02:50.471 --> 02:51.605
(WHOOPING)

02:51.672 --> 02:53.607
Okay, Spirit,
that's enough.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.577
All right,
put your phone away,
or it becomes my phone.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.879
Well, folks,
looks like the suits
are shuttin' me down.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.248
Thanks for all your support.

03:00.314 --> 03:03.083
Love you! Bye!
(CELLPHONE CHIMES)

03:03.150 --> 03:05.619
Sorry, but my friends insist
I keep them up to date.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.221
It's all right.
It's a big day.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.723
Spirit was born
with ectopia cordis.
She's been...

03:09.790 --> 03:12.626
Why didn't they repair it
when she was an infant?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.662
They couldn't.
Her rib cage
was too small.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.898
But after 14 years
of slow and steady growth...

03:17.965 --> 03:19.933
It's time to put this baby
where it belongs.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.341
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

03:37.818 --> 03:39.653
This is an
interesting view.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.789
I can see
the aortic arch.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.624
DR. REZNICK: Murphy.
Oh, it's all right.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.426
I'm used to
people being curious.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.960
I'm sure
you're looking forward

03:47.027 --> 03:48.429
to when there's nothing
to be curious about.

03:48.496 --> 03:52.500
Mm, what I'm really looking
forward to is...crowds.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.702
You like crowds?

03:55.336 --> 03:56.337
I don't know.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.805
I've never been in one.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.307
I can't go
to a normal school,

03:59.373 --> 04:02.009
and my parents barely ever
let me leave our house.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.678
Well, when a small bump
could stop your heart,
it makes sense.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.281
But you still have
a lot of friends?

04:07.348 --> 04:08.649
Yeah, of course.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.418
I mean, I just can't do
anything fun with them.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.986
If you can't
do anything fun,

04:13.053 --> 04:16.690
then how did you get them
to be your friend?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.359
Well, in case
you haven't noticed,

04:18.426 --> 04:19.527
I like to talk.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.028
Mm, yes.
And, uh...

04:21.094 --> 04:23.731
We all do everything
online now anyway.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.699
The first thing I'm gonna do
when I get out of here

04:25.766 --> 04:27.435
is take all my friends
to a concert.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.437
Like, general admission,
on the floor.

04:29.503 --> 04:30.571
I don't even care
who the band is,

04:30.638 --> 04:32.373
just as long
as the place is packed.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.207
Oh, and I'm
gonna hug everyone.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.576
You've never hugged anyone?

04:35.643 --> 04:36.744
Not even your parents?

04:36.810 --> 04:39.447
Kissed by my parents,
high-fived by my friends,

04:39.513 --> 04:41.682
but, nope, no hugs.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.351
It's just too risky.

04:44.552 --> 04:47.655
Hugs make me
feel trapped.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.758
Agh!
Sorry.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.225
Almost done.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.994
Pain in the
upper-right quadrant.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.396
It's jaundice.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.164
Bilirubin's off the chart.

04:57.230 --> 05:00.334
That doesn't make sense.
He's been doing so well
since the transplant.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.135
Yeah, every check-up
this year's been perfect.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.137
Well, it could just be
a temporary flare-up.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.606
We'll increase
his anti-rejection meds

05:05.673 --> 05:06.940
and do a full liver exam.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.008
We'll know more then.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.151
You two,
do the work-up.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.687
And you find
a new liver.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.054
Shouldn't we wait
for the biopsy result?

05:21.121 --> 05:22.956
Not when I already know
what it's gonna say.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.559
He needs
a new liver ASAP.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.094
I mean,
that's gonna be hard.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.261
He's Blood Type O.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.630
It's gonna be impossible.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.031
He's lucky they were able
to find the first one.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.199
DR. MELENDEZ: Well,
he better get lucky again,

05:32.265 --> 05:34.267
because it's our only way
to keep him alive.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.205
DR. LIM: We're screwed.

05:38.271 --> 05:41.041
Barbara Boxer got
ear barotrauma
scuba-diving in Cozumel

05:41.108 --> 05:42.510
and cannot fly
for two weeks,

05:42.576 --> 05:45.513
which means we don't have
a keynote speaker
for our gala.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.647
(CHUCKLES)

05:46.714 --> 05:47.981
You think
this is funny?

05:48.048 --> 05:51.084
I've just never
seen you anxious,

05:51.151 --> 05:54.388
and I seriously doubt
Barbara Boxer scuba-dives.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.723
It's just an excuse.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.057
She sent me a picture
from the hospital.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.392
Oh, really?
Yeah.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.627
Anyone can fake
a photograph.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.828
What are you doing?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.463
I am doing a search

06:02.530 --> 06:04.565
to see if our
esteemed senator

06:04.632 --> 06:05.766
from the great state
of California

06:05.833 --> 06:07.735
ever once, once

06:07.801 --> 06:09.803
talked about scuba-diving
in an interview.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.004
It doesn't matter
if it's true.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.574
What matters is that
we find a replacement.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.643
I need you to get me
a meeting with Aiden Coulter.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.077
Oh, Aiden Coulter?
Yes.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.547
Oh. What?
I sat next to him once

06:19.613 --> 06:20.848
at an A's game.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.149
And the story I remember
is that you two

06:22.215 --> 06:24.317
were talking smack
that entire game,

06:24.384 --> 06:26.086
and after he spilled
his beer on you

06:26.153 --> 06:28.221
and insisted on buying you
a new jacket,

06:28.288 --> 06:29.389
you refused him.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.091
So he owes you.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.494
Just get me a meeting.
I'll handle everything
from there.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.329
Okay.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.131
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.

06:38.198 --> 06:39.500
You're welcome.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.409
Huh.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.245
JARED:
You'll be fine.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.881
You've had
liver biopsies before.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.416
And they've always
hurt a lot.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.452
Please,
isn't there another way?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.621
Well, the other way, Eric,
would going through your neck,

07:00.688 --> 07:02.322
and I don't think
you'd like that anymore.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.357
Eric, do you know
why NBA players

07:04.424 --> 07:05.993
all wear headphones
before games?

07:06.059 --> 07:07.661
Don't look at him.
Look at me.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.196
I need you to answer me.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.865
Why do NBA players wear
headphones before games?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.534
I don't know.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.168
I guess they like music.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.804
No, they need music.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.006
Music helps them forget
about everything else

07:19.072 --> 07:20.508
and focus
on what's important...

07:20.574 --> 07:22.676
The game.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.011
Who's your favorite player?

07:24.077 --> 07:25.078
Curry.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.814
Okay.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.050
This is the song he listens to
before every game.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.019
How do you know?

07:32.085 --> 07:34.655
Because he's my favorite
player, too.

07:34.722 --> 07:38.692
I want you to close your eyes
and focus on this.

07:38.759 --> 07:39.793
Just this.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.396
It's cold.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.465
Yeah, now it is,
but if you stay focused,

07:45.533 --> 07:47.000
pretty soon,
it'll stop feeling cold

07:47.067 --> 07:48.268
and start to feel warm.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.237
When that happens,
I want you to nod your head,

07:50.303 --> 07:53.574
and you'll feel some pressure
and a small pinch.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.875
What if it does...

07:54.942 --> 07:57.444
Then close your eyes
and focus.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.284
You ready?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.432
Two minutes
and he'll be good to go.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.101
How'd you know
he was a basketball fan?

08:22.035 --> 08:23.904
His shoes.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.405
He's not wearing
any shoes.

08:25.472 --> 08:26.940
Yeah, they're in
a backpack in his room.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.143
You searched
his backpack?

08:30.210 --> 08:33.380
Well, it's, um,
less invasive
than a rectal,

08:33.446 --> 08:35.282
and most of the time
more useful.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.788
Okay, Spirit,
just keep still and...

08:40.854 --> 08:42.956
And during a few parts
of the exam,

08:43.023 --> 08:44.157
we may ask you
to hold your breath,

08:44.224 --> 08:45.893
but it'll only be
a few seconds.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.728
You got it.

08:47.795 --> 08:50.631
(WHIRRING)

08:50.698 --> 08:52.666
You gonna buy a tux
or rent one?

08:54.067 --> 08:55.936
The fundraiser
is black tie.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.304
I have a suit.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.739
It's new.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.441
I bought it
for my resident interviews.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.243
It doesn't matter
how new it is.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.779
It's not a tux.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.816
Wearing a uniform at work
reassures patients.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.751
Wearing a uniform
at a party

09:10.818 --> 09:13.286
does nothing but make you
hot and uncomfortable.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.288
This party is work.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.556
Get a tux.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.659
And not a crappy one
from some outlet store.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.094
Get fitted by a pro and
spend a minimum of two grand.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.163
You're gonna meet rich people
who can help your career,

09:23.230 --> 09:24.598
and they're not gonna want
to help some slob in a...

09:24.665 --> 09:26.366
I'm not a slob.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.301
No, I am very clean

09:28.368 --> 09:30.370
and make sure my clothes
are never wrinkled.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.072
And it's too big.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.175
Her heart.

09:35.242 --> 09:39.346
It's enlarged 53%
since her last exam.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.349
Her last exam was only
six months ago.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.184
It won't fit.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.353
Too big.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.856
The biopsy confirmed
acute cellular rejection.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.758
We maximized his
immuno-suppressives,
but, uh...

09:50.824 --> 09:53.160
I found one.
A Type-O liver.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.762
Are you sure?

09:54.828 --> 09:56.764
Park and I
checked the registry,
and there weren't any.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.398
I found it online.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.200
He, uh...
He already tried
to make a direct donation

10:00.267 --> 10:01.301
a few months ago,

10:01.368 --> 10:03.036
but the patient died
before the surgery.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.939
I contacted him,
which wasn't easy,

10:06.006 --> 10:08.041
but he still wants
to be a donor.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.376
That's amazing.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.443
Great job.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.713
What's the catch?

10:12.780 --> 10:14.581
He wants to be a donor,
but he's not on the registry?

10:14.648 --> 10:16.884
I mean, there's got
to be a catch.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.820
He, uh... He can't
be on the registry

10:19.887 --> 10:21.755
because he is in prison.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.357
For murder.

10:24.424 --> 10:27.294
Actually, um,
seven murders.

10:33.266 --> 10:37.504
Boris Tirayan was
a Russian Mafia enforcer
convicted of seven murders.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.272
Who now wants
to make amends.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.041
He tried to be a donor
a few months ago,

10:41.108 --> 10:43.744
but the patient died
before the red tape
could be worked out.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.512
But now that it has...

10:45.578 --> 10:48.415
Are there any laws against
an inmate becoming a donor?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.918
No, but there is
a ton of liability.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.252
What if he attacks
someone here?

10:52.319 --> 10:53.620
He'll be guarded
by state prison guards

10:53.687 --> 10:54.855
on a separate level,

10:54.922 --> 10:56.724
away from patients
and all non-essential staff.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.992
Everyone deserves the chance
to turn their life around.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.460
The guy wants
to do something decent,

11:00.527 --> 11:01.762
we should let him.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.164
I don't think we owe
a murderer anything.

11:04.231 --> 11:07.067
But maybe
he owes us something.
He has a debt to society.

11:07.134 --> 11:10.704
Which he would repay by
donating his inner organs.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.039
Isn't it
a slippery slope

11:12.105 --> 11:13.606
between a guy
who wants to make amends

11:13.673 --> 11:14.875
and turning
our prison system

11:14.942 --> 11:16.643
into a superstore
for body parts?

11:16.710 --> 11:19.847
A slippery slope that
saves a child's life.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.282
It'll never happen.
He's just trying
to get a hospital,

11:22.349 --> 11:23.751
where it'll be
easier to escape.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.053
You have no idea
what his motivation is.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.121
I know he's a
lying sociopath

11:28.188 --> 11:29.289
who doesn't care
about anyone but himself.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.658
He's been a model inmate
for nine years.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.326
Tutors other prisoners
in the library...

11:33.393 --> 11:35.028
Yeah, because he's trying
to get someone to trust him,

11:35.095 --> 11:36.964
to give him an inch,
and as soon as they do...

11:37.697 --> 11:39.266
We got approval.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.068
He's gonna stall,
make excuses,

11:41.134 --> 11:42.936
and when he sees his chance,
someone's gonna get hurt.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.405
I think it's worth
taking that chance.

11:45.472 --> 11:48.708
Anybody who doesn't agree,
feel free to sit this one out.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.281
DR. REZNICK:
When you started
menstruating,

11:54.347 --> 11:57.217
the increased estrogen
caused pulmonary hypertension,

11:57.284 --> 11:59.452
which isn't a surgical issue
in itself,

11:59.519 --> 12:01.588
but along with your
atypical vascular system...

12:01.654 --> 12:04.224
Your heart's
grown too big.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.359
DR. LIM: We will control
your blood pressure

12:06.426 --> 12:09.229
so that you will keep growing
but your heart won't,

12:09.296 --> 12:10.831
and then,
by the time you're 18,
we'll able to...

12:10.898 --> 12:11.932
No.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.767
I'm not waiting
any longer.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.102
Spirit, honey,
it will be okay.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.503
No, it won't!

12:16.569 --> 12:18.872
I'm sick of being stuck inside
all the time.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.374
I'm sick of this!

12:23.143 --> 12:26.646
I don't ever want to text,
call, or video chat again.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.415
Mom,
I want to be touched.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.185
I want to be shoved.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.323
I want to be punched.
I don't even care, just...

12:36.389 --> 12:37.424
Please.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.228
Please.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.331
I want this surgery now.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.172
I need it.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.177
I'm sorry.
We can't.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.486
We need to get rid of
all the furniture and artwork.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.222
I get removing the paintings,
but the furniture?

13:09.289 --> 13:11.825
Don't want the prison guards
sitting down on the job.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.660
He's gonna be
in full restraints,

13:13.726 --> 13:14.862
cuffed to the bed.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.363
Well, that's our plan,

13:16.429 --> 13:19.532
but we also need to be
prepared for his plan.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.902
Okay, we need to get
rid of the window blinds,
curtain rods,

13:21.969 --> 13:23.670
jacket hooks, and make sure
there's no metal rivets

13:23.736 --> 13:25.372
or eyelets
on the mattress.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.407
Um, what's he gonna do
with a metal eyelet?

13:27.474 --> 13:29.342
Tear it off the mattress
and file it down

13:29.409 --> 13:31.311
to cut your jugular, or
bend it into a handcuff key,

13:31.378 --> 13:33.480
or shove it into
an electric socket

13:33.546 --> 13:36.316
to create a spark
and start a fire.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.719
I've seen knives made out of
toilet paper, soap, and salt

13:39.786 --> 13:41.688
that could amputate
a fat guy's femur.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.800
Not quite sure he
needed the part about
the guy being fat.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.436
(BOTH LAUGH)

13:56.503 --> 13:59.739
So, I've been thinking.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.441
You want to go to
the fundraiser together?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.911
It's not a prom.
We don't have to bring a date.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.446
Yeah, we don't have to.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.883
But we can,
if we want.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.384
Everyone basically knows
we're seeing each other,

14:11.451 --> 14:13.286
but still...

14:13.353 --> 14:15.222
I think it might be
a nice opportunity

14:15.288 --> 14:18.658
to take our relationship
out into the open.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.429
Unless
you don't want to.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.998
No, it's a good idea.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.199
Are you sure?

14:26.266 --> 14:27.667
Because, you know,
we don't have to.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.970
Yeah.
Let's do it.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.272
(CELLPHONES CHIME)

14:35.842 --> 14:37.377
Let's go.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.578
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

14:38.645 --> 14:40.080
What's wrong?

14:40.147 --> 14:41.648
WALLACE: It's fine.
He'll be all right.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.316
No, I won't. I don't
want a murderer's liver!

14:43.383 --> 14:44.684
It's evil!

14:44.751 --> 14:46.753
(SIGHS) Eric,
there's no such thing

14:46.819 --> 14:47.820
as a good
or bad liver.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.990
It's just a...
Just an organ.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.992
CLAIRE: Eric,
this is your only choice.

14:52.059 --> 14:55.095
If we don't
do the transplant,
you will die.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.696
ERIC: I don't want him
to be a part of me,

14:56.763 --> 14:58.631
inside me forever,
all right?

14:58.698 --> 15:00.667
I don't care what you
or anybody else says, okay?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.835
It's my body,
and I don't want it!

15:07.540 --> 15:08.976
That's ridiculous.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.344
Personality traits
aren't transferred in
an organ transplant.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.545
It's also irrelevant.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.880
Children don't consent
to surgeries,

15:13.947 --> 15:15.582
their parents do.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.517
But if he doesn't cooperate
with the anti-rejection
regimen,

15:17.584 --> 15:19.819
we could be wasting a liver
that could save
someone else's life.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.454
DR. PARK: No one's
getting saved by Tirayan.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.889
I found a Type-A donor.
It's not a perfect match,
but...

15:22.956 --> 15:25.158
His body's already
rejected a perfect match.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.360
There's no way it can tolerate
an incompatible blood type.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.162
CLAIRE:
No, the only way
to save Eric

15:29.229 --> 15:31.031
is to do the transplant
with Tirayan's liver.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.165
That is it.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.967
We have
no other option.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.772
Let the O.R. know we're gonna
need more restraints.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.676
Dr. Clinton Ford
out of Alberta

15:43.743 --> 15:46.379
developed an experimental
resorbable material.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.448
It would allow us
to expand her rib cage

15:48.515 --> 15:50.650
and create room
to fit her heart inside.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.219
DR. LIM:
An artificial sternum.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.787
DR. REZNICK:
That would actually
grow along with the patient.

15:54.854 --> 15:57.490
The surgery
isn't reversible.

15:57.557 --> 15:58.925
If it doesn't work,

15:58.992 --> 16:01.494
we can't just move her heart
back to where it was.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.196
It would allow her
to have a life.

16:03.263 --> 16:06.033
She has a life,
and she'll be healthy

16:06.099 --> 16:07.667
as long as she stays
out of crowds,

16:07.734 --> 16:08.835
doesn't hug anyone,

16:08.901 --> 16:10.470
or do anything
where she might fall.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.406
I get you're autistic,
but I know even you realize

16:13.473 --> 16:16.109
when a patient
cries and throws
her phone against the wall,

16:16.176 --> 16:18.178
they're not happy
with their current health.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.879
There's no reason
to make this personal.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.814
DR. REZNICK:
There is if his medical
judgment is biased.

16:21.881 --> 16:25.018
I saw she was upset.

16:25.085 --> 16:28.221
You saw it,
but you didn't understand it.

16:28.288 --> 16:31.091
You're very competitive.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.227
Are you trying to make
Dr. Lim think I'm biased,

16:34.294 --> 16:37.297
or are you trying
to undermine my confidence?

16:37.364 --> 16:39.532
I'm actually trying
to help you and the patient.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.234
She wants to be able
to rub elbows,

16:41.301 --> 16:44.271
and you need to learn
how to trade elbows.

16:44.337 --> 16:48.675
DR. LIM: The resorbable plate
is experimental and risky.

16:48.741 --> 16:52.679
But my medical judgment
is that it's worth it.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.283
Make sure she agrees
and then get her prepped.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.623
Why me?

17:03.690 --> 17:06.426
I'm not famous, I don't know
anything about medicine,

17:06.493 --> 17:08.795
and giving the keynote speech
at your fundraiser

17:08.861 --> 17:11.231
is a steep price to pay
for a beer-stained jacket.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.804
You grew up
in San Jose.

17:17.870 --> 17:23.076
You went to San Jose State
despite being accepted
by both Princeton and MIT,

17:23.143 --> 17:24.744
and you headquartered
your company here,

17:24.811 --> 17:28.081
despite huge tax breaks
offered by Chicago
and Minneapolis.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.549
And it was
his favorite jacket.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.284
Well, when I offered
to have it cleaned,

17:31.351 --> 17:33.153
he said not to bother
because he didn't
even like the jacket.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.322
He was being polite.
Polite?

17:35.388 --> 17:36.856
I take it you've never been
to a game with him.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.761
You did some homework,
but not enough.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.596
I love this city,
but I have giving speeches.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.998
So don't give a speech.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.034
Tell us a story.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.669
Like the one you told
at the wrap party

17:49.736 --> 17:51.003
at the Youth Dance company's
fall musical.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.005
The one where you got lost
at the Paris catacombs.

17:55.975 --> 17:56.976
I stand corrected.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.612
Your success
is inspiring, Aiden,

17:59.679 --> 18:02.682
as well as your loyalty
to this city.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.485
And the fact that
you're young,
apparently very funny...

18:05.552 --> 18:07.520
I'm in.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.955
Actually, I was in
as soon as Aaron told me

18:09.021 --> 18:11.358
what you wanted
to meet about.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.993
But I was curious what
your attack strategy would be.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.495
So, how was it?

18:15.562 --> 18:17.029
It was very effective.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.363
DR. PARK:
Now, don't worry.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.898
He's been a model inmate
for nine years

18:51.964 --> 18:54.501
and tutors
the other prisoners
in the library.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.416
Coke nail come in handy
up at Pelican Bay?

19:09.482 --> 19:10.750
I make jewelry.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.052
Helps me
pick up the beads.

19:13.119 --> 19:16.289
Is there a history of cancer
or liver disease
in your family?

19:16.356 --> 19:17.824
I went through this
a couple of months ago.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.692
You have my file.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.494
We need to do
our own exam.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.596
CLAIRE: And there's nothing
about your family
in previous records.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.731
Are they still alive?

19:24.797 --> 19:26.032
They're dead to me.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.167
Quit stalling, or we'll
send you back right now.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.741
I haven't spoken to anyone
in my family since
I was 15 years old.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.644
Last I know, uh,
both my parents
were healthy enough

19:37.710 --> 19:40.447
to kick the crap out of me
on a daily basis.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.583
Any other questions?

19:43.650 --> 19:45.184
Why do you want
to do this?

19:45.252 --> 19:48.120
Maybe I just like, uh,
cute nurses and bad Jell-o.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.223
Why do you care?
We don't.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.124
As long as you do
what you're told.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.761
Don't worry.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.129
I'm very good
at following orders.

20:04.937 --> 20:08.741
Councilman Burns must be
very happy with his facelift.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.643
He just bought another table
for the fundraiser.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.580
I aim to please,
but you already knew that.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.615
And I need to
get into surgery,
so stop being so coy.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.883
What's up?

20:18.751 --> 20:21.321
You and Isabel always
seem very happy,

20:21.388 --> 20:24.056
able to manage both
your professional
and personal lives.

20:24.123 --> 20:27.960
I'm flattered you think so,
but still a bit coy.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.263
When I met with Aiden Coulter
about being our keynote,

20:30.330 --> 20:31.531
I thought there was a spark.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.833
Okay, so now we're
getting somewhere.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.603
Surgery can wait
a few minutes.

20:36.669 --> 20:40.773
Is it unprofessional of me
to explore it?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.141
He's not
a hospital employee,

20:42.208 --> 20:44.944
but potentially
a significant donor

20:45.011 --> 20:46.913
and younger.

20:46.979 --> 20:47.980
Quite a bit.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.248
Mm-hmm.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.952
I don't know, maybe I'm
just imagining something

20:53.019 --> 20:54.354
that doesn't even exist.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.555
Oh, I doubt that.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.524
You're an attractive, smart,
interesting woman.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.526
I'm sure
there was a spark.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.228
But you can't date a donor
like Coulter.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.464
Sorry.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.366
There's no actual policy
against it.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.101
I'm not talking policy,
I'm talking optics.

21:09.168 --> 21:11.003
The last thing you want
is someone thinking

21:11.070 --> 21:13.540
you'd use sex
to get a big donation.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.310
It's a double standard,
I know,

21:17.377 --> 21:19.446
but it's the world
we live in.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.548
I said no!
I don't want it!

21:23.350 --> 21:24.884
I thought you gave him
something to calm him.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.486
We did,
but he's too agitated.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.555
I'm gonna start him
on IV midazolam now.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.858
Eric. Eric, remember
what Dr. Park said
earlier about focusing?

21:31.924 --> 21:33.660
I know you can do that.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.927
How about we get those earbuds
you had earlier?

21:34.994 --> 21:37.530
No! Leave me alone!
Eric! Stop it.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.298
Look at me!

21:39.366 --> 21:41.100
Do not move.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.686
SHAUN: You wear
very stylish clothes.

22:00.553 --> 22:01.954
Um, thank you.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.156
I assume you mean
when I'm not in surgery.

22:04.223 --> 22:07.694
Yes. Do you think people
believe you're a better doctor

22:07.760 --> 22:08.761
because of that?

22:10.397 --> 22:11.998
Some people.

22:12.064 --> 22:15.334
Others probably just think
I'm a show-off or arrogant,
gay.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.970
I don't care.
I do it for myself.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.238
You look good,
you feel good.

22:19.305 --> 22:21.307
Does it help you
make friends?

22:23.242 --> 22:26.012
Feeling good about yourself
helps with everything.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.617
Do you know where I can buy
a stylish tuxedo?

22:30.683 --> 22:33.052
I can pay $2,000.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.654
Okay.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.723
Dr. Reznick says

22:36.789 --> 22:39.191
if I want people who matter
to help my career,

22:39.258 --> 22:43.262
I need to wear a tuxedo
that costs $2,000
to the fundraiser.

22:43.329 --> 22:45.264
Have you talked
to Glassman about this?

22:45.331 --> 22:48.034
No. I make
my own decisions now.

22:50.503 --> 22:53.540
Murphy, people who matter
will help your career

22:53.606 --> 22:55.241
because they're impressed
with your talent

22:55.307 --> 22:56.943
and potential
as a surgeon.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.078
And I could send you
to my tailor,

22:59.145 --> 23:01.481
where you'll definitely
spend two grand.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.550
But my advice would be
just rent one.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.117
Make sure you get fitted
by the manager,

23:05.184 --> 23:07.353
and for a
couple-hundred bucks,
you'll be fine.

23:15.294 --> 23:18.064
I'm gonna need you to count
backwards from 10.

I said he'll do anything
to convince us to trust him,

23:34.046 --> 23:35.047
to let our guard down.

they're swelling up.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.626

He's having an
allergic reaction.

23:46.693 --> 23:47.960
Stop the anesthesia.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.229

and give you steroids.

they're extremely grateful
for everything you did.

He's the Chief of Surgery.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.910
What's happening?
Did you find
a new liver donor?

31:17.977 --> 31:20.179
Actually, it's,
it's the same one.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.049
The circumstances
have changed.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.985
This is incredible.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.453
No, I don't want it.

31:27.519 --> 31:31.423
Eric,
when the donor found out

31:31.490 --> 31:34.626
that he couldn't do
the surgery to help you,

31:34.693 --> 31:37.096
he became incredibly sad

31:37.163 --> 31:41.867
because he wanted you to live
more than he wanted to live.

31:44.103 --> 31:48.574
He ended his life so that
you could have his liver.

31:49.775 --> 31:53.980
He... He knew he'd done
some bad things,

31:54.046 --> 31:57.216
and I think that
this was the only way

31:57.283 --> 31:59.185
he knew
how to make amends.

32:01.187 --> 32:03.589
I think we should try
and help him.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.459
Do you think
you can do that?

32:07.526 --> 32:10.396

do something good?

32:19.838 --> 32:21.040
Yeah.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.712
Everything looks good.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.014
Remember to take
deep breaths

32:28.080 --> 32:30.349
so you don't develop
any lung complications,

32:30.416 --> 32:33.619
and, obviously, avoid
lifting anything too heavy

32:33.685 --> 32:35.121
for the next
few weeks.

He's an assassin who
murdered people for money.

35:12.010 --> 35:14.880
Today was just one more
cold-blooded killing.
