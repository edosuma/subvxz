[Lucy VO] I have a theory:

disturbingly like falling in

think could help moving forward.

it again, okay?

31:22.141 --> 31:23.446

sent me flowers,

31:23.490 --> 31:26.667

a very classy move.

a lot in common.

Good morning, Josh.

put little clues inside.

[Lucy] Ow.

39:39.028 --> 39:40.378
Sorry.

39:42.118 --> 39:43.642
Ugh.

39:47.036 --> 39:48.516
[knocking]

39:48.560 --> 39:50.562
-[Josh] Still alive in there?
-[Lucy] [mumbling] Yeah.

39:50.605 --> 39:52.346
[Josh] All right, sit up.

39:52.999 --> 39:54.740
Time to take your temp.

40:00.180 --> 40:01.747
Open up, Rambo.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.531
There you go.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.143
You're in my bedroom.

40:09.232 --> 40:10.973
I'm wearing Sleepysaurus.

40:11.017 --> 40:12.627
[Josh] Try not to
talk, Shortcake.

40:12.671 --> 40:15.021
I know that's hard for you.

40:17.545 --> 40:19.286
Here we go.

40:20.156 --> 40:21.375
102.8.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.596
Ooh, that's not very
nice, Mr. Thermometer.

40:24.639 --> 40:26.772
[laughs]

40:27.207 --> 40:29.209
Are you laughing?

40:30.210 --> 40:32.865
Oh, I must be hallucinating.

40:33.213 --> 40:34.432
Sit tight.

40:34.475 --> 40:36.216
I'll be back.

40:42.265 --> 40:44.050
[Lucy] [mumbling]
No, there's two of you.

40:44.093 --> 40:48.097
[sighs] Josh must have
gotten wet after midnight.

40:49.621 --> 40:51.231
-Lucy?
-Mm.

40:51.274 --> 40:51.927
[Patrick] I'm a doctor.

40:51.971 --> 40:52.972
How are you feeling?

40:53.015 --> 40:54.016
Not so good.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.105
She's got a fever of 103.

40:56.628 --> 40:58.151
All right, let's sit you up.

40:58.194 --> 40:59.587
Okay.

40:59.631 --> 41:01.110
[groans]

41:02.851 --> 41:04.636
[sighs]

41:07.160 --> 41:09.597
You are really handsome.

41:09.641 --> 41:11.599
[laughs] Thank you.

41:11.643 --> 41:15.081
People always say Josh
is the good-looking one.

41:15.560 --> 41:18.040
Oh, you're his brother.

41:18.084 --> 41:21.087
Oh, you must've wanted to beat
him up so much when you were a

41:21.130 --> 41:23.132
-kid.
-[laughs]

41:23.176 --> 41:23.916
I like her.

41:23.959 --> 41:25.395
Oh, she's very special.

41:25.439 --> 41:26.832
Wait, can you tell me
embarrassing things about him?

41:26.875 --> 41:28.529
You must know all
the best stuff.

41:28.573 --> 41:30.270
Well, um...

41:30.313 --> 41:31.880
He used to dress
up like a dog--

41:31.924 --> 41:33.273
No...

41:33.316 --> 41:34.840
Make our mom walk him
around the block. [laughs]

41:34.883 --> 41:36.711
[laughing] Oh, my God, this
is the best day of my life.

41:36.755 --> 41:38.496
I was a kid, thank you.

41:38.539 --> 41:39.540
He was 12.

41:39.584 --> 41:40.367
[gasp] No!

41:40.410 --> 41:41.977
Oh, Josh, that's too old.

41:42.021 --> 41:43.718
All right, thank you very much
for the house call, Doctor.

41:43.762 --> 41:45.154
Time to go.

41:45.198 --> 41:46.895
Laughter's the
best medicine, right?

41:46.939 --> 41:48.636
[laughs]

41:51.291 --> 41:53.162
[groaning] No...

41:53.772 --> 41:55.774
You did all the right things.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.124
You would've been good at this.

41:59.212 --> 42:01.954
I'm not trying to
be a dick, come on.

42:02.345 --> 42:04.347
I'm just saying, you did good.

42:07.133 --> 42:09.135
So...

42:09.178 --> 42:11.354
you ever gonna RSVP?

42:11.398 --> 42:14.270
It's just that, you know, Mindy
and I need a final head count.

42:14.314 --> 42:16.359
Yeah, yeah, uh...

42:16.403 --> 42:18.057
I've just been slammed at work.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.319
Sorry.

42:19.841 --> 42:21.451
Look, man...

42:21.495 --> 42:23.758
it's awkward, I get it.

42:23.802 --> 42:26.979
But when your brother
gets married, you show up.

42:27.022 --> 42:28.415
Bring a plus one.

42:28.458 --> 42:30.112
[Josh] Oh yeah, right,
'cause that's what we need:

42:30.156 --> 42:33.551
more witnesses to our
absurd family drama.

42:34.247 --> 42:36.031
[Patrick] Keep her fluids up.

42:37.119 --> 42:39.731
Call me if the fever gets worse.

42:40.166 --> 42:41.254
Thank you, Pat.

42:41.297 --> 42:42.951
[Patrick] Thank
you, little brother.

42:42.995 --> 42:44.823
[door opens]

42:50.219 --> 42:52.613
-[Josh] How are we doin'?
-Hey.

42:53.135 --> 42:55.268
I brought you a little water.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.185
N-- I'm not a baby.

42:59.228 --> 43:00.621
You already broke
two glasses earlier,

43:00.665 --> 43:03.276
so better safe than sorry.

43:03.842 --> 43:05.844
There you go.

43:07.454 --> 43:09.543
My mom always gave me
strawberry juice when I was

43:09.587 --> 43:11.197
sick.

43:11.676 --> 43:13.112
What did yours do?

43:13.155 --> 43:15.723
Oh, they were always too
busy treating other people.

43:15.767 --> 43:17.116
If you weren't in
cardiac arrest,

43:17.159 --> 43:19.814
your ailment
didn't exactly rank.

43:19.858 --> 43:21.424
Is your whole family doctors?

43:21.468 --> 43:23.165
And surgeons.

43:23.644 --> 43:25.298
Except me.

43:27.387 --> 43:30.042
Has anyone ever told you that
you look like a young Dennis

43:30.085 --> 43:31.043
Quaid?

43:31.086 --> 43:32.566
[laughs]

43:32.610 --> 43:34.263
I think it's time to take
your temp again, Shortcake.

43:34.307 --> 43:36.048
No, stop calling me that.

43:36.091 --> 43:37.658
Oh, not a chance.

43:37.702 --> 43:40.052
Watching you pretend to hate
that nickname is the best part

43:40.095 --> 43:41.619
of my day.

43:42.010 --> 43:44.012
You changed shirts.

43:44.317 --> 43:46.406
You look like an Old Navy model.

43:46.449 --> 43:47.842
My brother brought it for me.

43:47.886 --> 43:49.757
You puked on the
other one, remember?

43:49.801 --> 43:51.759
-Oh, yeah.
-Mm.

43:52.934 --> 43:57.765
Dove gray, white, powder
blue, window pane, true blue.

43:57.809 --> 44:00.159
-[Josh] What's that?
-Your shirts.

44:00.202 --> 44:03.205
Always in the same order.

44:04.598 --> 44:06.948
I guess I am that predictable.

44:06.992 --> 44:09.690
Yeah, you only
surprised me once.

44:09.734 --> 44:12.345
-[Josh] When was that?
-The elevator.

44:13.215 --> 44:15.000
And...

44:15.043 --> 44:17.089
what did you think about that?

44:17.132 --> 44:18.917
[sighs]

44:20.309 --> 44:23.225
Yeah, I thought
it was really hot.

44:30.232 --> 44:32.278
Are we playing the staring game?

44:32.321 --> 44:34.280
It's my favorite.

44:35.455 --> 44:38.240
I like the way you look at me.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.724
[Josh] Get some rest.

44:48.294 --> 44:50.339
[sighs]

45:02.351 --> 45:03.483
Josh?

45:03.526 --> 45:06.355
Oh, she lives!

45:07.356 --> 45:09.358
Why are you
cleaning my apartment?

45:09.402 --> 45:10.969
Oh, actually, I
didn't clean it.

45:11.012 --> 45:12.710
I demoed the whole thing and
rebuilt it from the ground up

45:12.753 --> 45:13.798
with a team of elves.

45:13.841 --> 45:15.277
Figured it was easier.

45:15.321 --> 45:17.932
Okay, just 'cause I'm not
turned on by the smell of

45:17.976 --> 45:19.151
cleaning supplies--

45:19.194 --> 45:21.544
Weird, that doesn't
sound like "Thank you"--

45:21.588 --> 45:23.024
-[Lucy] No--
-But you're very welcome.

45:23.068 --> 45:24.156
Thank you.

45:24.199 --> 45:25.461
Seriously, thank
you for everything.

45:25.505 --> 45:27.463
But just-- would
you-- stop, stop.

45:27.507 --> 45:28.203
This is weird.

45:28.247 --> 45:29.770
This is way too weird.

45:30.118 --> 45:32.773
Oh, and if you use any
of this against me--

45:32.817 --> 45:35.863
Oh, right, because knowing
the consistency of your vomit's

45:35.907 --> 45:37.517
really gonna give me
a competitive edge.

45:37.560 --> 45:38.561
No, Josh, stop.

45:38.605 --> 45:40.041
No, I get it, it's fine.

45:40.085 --> 45:42.478
My brother left a prescription
for you on the table.

45:42.522 --> 45:44.132
See you at the office.

45:46.221 --> 45:48.093
[Lucy] [sighs]

45:51.792 --> 45:53.315
Shit.

45:57.580 --> 45:58.930
[Danny] Did you know daisies
are found on every continent

45:58.973 --> 46:01.541
except Antartica-arctica?

46:01.584 --> 46:02.890
Oh, gotta go.

46:02.934 --> 46:03.935
Lucy!

46:03.978 --> 46:05.414
-[clears throat]
-[Lucy] Hi!

46:05.458 --> 46:06.372
What are you doing here?

46:06.415 --> 46:08.417
I got you these.

46:08.809 --> 46:09.592
Always with the flowers.

46:09.636 --> 46:10.898
You're very sweet.

46:10.942 --> 46:12.204
How are you feeling?

46:12.247 --> 46:15.207
Like my body survived a
violent alien abduction.

46:15.250 --> 46:17.949
Fun fact about alien
abductions: not violent.

46:17.992 --> 46:20.560
They get a bad rep 'cause of all
the probe stuff but my personal

46:20.603 --> 46:22.780
feelings are that aliens
are actually people from,

46:22.823 --> 46:25.304
like, a million years from
now just checkin' in on their

46:25.347 --> 46:26.827
ancestors.

46:26.871 --> 46:28.437
I don't know if you've read
Nick Bostrom's 'Simulation

46:28.481 --> 46:30.526
Hypothesis,' but if you build a
quantum computer the size of a

46:30.570 --> 46:31.397
planet...

46:31.440 --> 46:32.833
[ding]

46:33.878 --> 46:35.314
And after you.

46:35.357 --> 46:36.576
If you think about the
exponential rate of computing

46:36.619 --> 46:38.926
power alone from, like,
40 years ago 'til now,

46:38.970 --> 46:41.755
and then you do that from, like,
4,000 years or four million

46:41.799 --> 46:44.453
years, there's basically
no way we're not aliens.

46:44.497 --> 46:45.454
[chuckles]

46:45.498 --> 46:46.716
That's-- that's cool.

46:46.760 --> 46:47.717
-[Danny] It's crazy, right?
-[Lucy] Yeah.

46:47.761 --> 46:49.589
[both chuckle]

46:50.024 --> 46:52.287
Hey, so you wanna
get dinner tonight?

46:53.201 --> 46:54.376
Maybe.

46:54.420 --> 46:56.422
I'll-- I'll have to
see how I'm feeling.

46:57.031 --> 46:58.772
[Danny] Hey, JTT!

46:58.816 --> 47:00.034
Temple-man.

47:00.078 --> 47:01.775
What's up, dude bro?

47:01.819 --> 47:03.559
You don't work here anymore.

47:03.603 --> 47:04.734
Yeah.

47:04.778 --> 47:06.475
Just checkin' in on my girl.

47:06.519 --> 47:08.564
The old Lucy Goose.

47:08.608 --> 47:11.045
Lucille Ball 'n' Chain.

47:11.089 --> 47:14.396
Lucy in the Sky with Danny.

47:16.181 --> 47:17.530
Wow.

47:17.573 --> 47:18.748
Okay.

47:18.792 --> 47:20.707
No vibe, huh?

47:22.100 --> 47:23.318
[Helen] Lucy?

47:23.362 --> 47:24.885
Can you come see me
when you get settled?

47:24.929 --> 47:26.626
Yeah, yeah, just one second.

47:26.669 --> 47:28.846
-Um--
-Guess that's my cue.

47:29.934 --> 47:30.978
Oh.

47:31.022 --> 47:32.110
Thanks.

47:32.153 --> 47:33.459
-Yeah, I'll email you.
-[Danny] Okay.

47:33.502 --> 47:35.287
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

47:37.115 --> 47:38.333
Oh.

47:40.553 --> 47:41.423
[chuckles]

47:41.467 --> 47:42.685
[ding]

47:42.729 --> 47:44.426
Strawberry juice.

47:50.519 --> 47:53.087
You sent the roses.

47:53.871 --> 47:58.440
[phone rings]

47:58.484 --> 48:00.573
Joshua Templeman.

48:01.487 --> 48:02.923
Yes, I'll be right there.

48:02.967 --> 48:04.359
Thank you.

48:06.144 --> 48:08.363
Glad you're feeling better.

48:10.670 --> 48:12.150
Crap.

48:15.501 --> 48:17.416
[knocking]

48:17.459 --> 48:18.591
Oh.

48:18.634 --> 48:20.680
I saw you
submitted your application.

48:20.723 --> 48:21.855
I know, it's a long-shot.

48:21.899 --> 48:23.030
Are you kidding me?

48:23.074 --> 48:25.119
I'm counting on you
getting this job.

48:25.163 --> 48:27.513
We can't let Bexley turn
this place into some kind of--

48:27.556 --> 48:28.949
Commercial shit house?

48:28.993 --> 48:31.038
[laughs] I was
gonna say "factory."

48:31.082 --> 48:32.126
But yeah.

48:32.170 --> 48:33.867
Josh submitted his
application too.

48:33.911 --> 48:34.999
I know.

48:35.042 --> 48:37.218
His Harvard MBA
won't hurt his chances.

48:37.262 --> 48:39.829
I have a Master's
in Victorian Lit.

48:39.873 --> 48:40.656
Does that count?

48:40.700 --> 48:42.006
For me, it does.

48:42.049 --> 48:44.356
Not so much for
the money people.

48:44.399 --> 48:47.011
There are a lot of
good candidates, Lucy.

48:47.054 --> 48:48.969
Will you be honest with me?

48:49.013 --> 48:50.536
How much of a shot do I have?

48:50.579 --> 48:52.451
Because I really want this
job and I-- I need to prepare

48:52.494 --> 48:53.365
myself--

48:53.408 --> 48:55.062
Don't underestimate yourself.

48:55.106 --> 48:58.500
You already coordinate
every department on my behalf.

48:58.544 --> 49:00.546
You know this company
from the bottom up.

49:00.589 --> 49:02.069
You have fantastic instincts.

49:02.113 --> 49:03.723
Frankly...

49:03.766 --> 49:07.161
I should have promoted
you to editorial years ago.

49:07.553 --> 49:10.121
Why didn't you?

49:10.948 --> 49:13.559
You never asked.

49:13.863 --> 49:17.171
And I rely on you to do the
parts of my job that I hate

49:17.215 --> 49:22.220
doing, which is why you'd
make a great managing director.

49:31.969 --> 49:33.971
I'm trying to say thank you.

49:34.014 --> 49:34.710
No need.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.820
Josh is a Harvard

01:00:06.864 --> 01:00:08.039
Ah, a few decades after me,
but the crimson runs deep,

01:00:08.082 --> 01:00:08.735
-am I right?

Oh.

01:00:12.217 --> 01:00:14.436
Simon knows half the
hiring panel personally.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.961
I'm sure that he'd be willing
to write you one hell of a

01:00:17.004 --> 01:00:17.918
recommendation.

01:00:17.962 --> 01:00:19.093
I'd appreciate that.

01:00:19.137 --> 01:00:20.399
[Simon] Let's talk
about it over lunch.

01:00:20.442 --> 01:00:21.313
[Josh] I'll clear my schedule.

01:00:21.356 --> 01:00:24.185
Oh, hey, this is Lucy Hinton.

01:00:24.229 --> 01:00:25.534
No, it's Hutton.

01:00:25.578 --> 01:00:26.753
You sure?

01:00:26.797 --> 01:00:29.103
Uh, yeah.

01:00:32.977 --> 01:00:38.025
Yeah, so I thought maybe you
could write me a recommendation.

01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:41.333
Yes, it was 10 years ago.

can remember anything at all,

01:01:03.007 --> 01:01:05.836
[sighs] So I really need
to nail this presentation.

01:01:05.879 --> 01:01:07.838
I'm thinking I can
probably pay you...

01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:09.187

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.579

01:01:10.623 --> 01:01:12.190

Hey, so...

01:01:18.718 --> 01:01:21.503
just to be totally clear,
there's no chance for anything

01:01:21.547 --> 01:01:24.289
else, right?

01:01:24.332 --> 01:01:25.464
Yeah.

I'm so sorry that we missed
your son's rehearsal dinner.

I'll just text them that we
hit traffic and we'll see them

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.046
Yeah, but what if they
know we already checked in?

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.265
Why do you care so much
what my parents think?

01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:18.920
Well, it's people-pleasing
101: they are people,

01:08:18.964 --> 01:08:20.313
thus I want to please them.

01:08:20.357 --> 01:08:21.836

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.707
Well, I already explained
the totality of that logic.

01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:26.798
Also, why don't you
care what people think?

01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:29.540

it's impossible to make people

him grow into the man he is

01:16:53.826 --> 01:16:55.436
today, hm?

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.265
A son a father can be proud of.

01:16:59.049 --> 01:17:01.442
But [clears throat] of all the
good decisions that Patrick has

01:17:01.486 --> 01:17:05.316
made, marrying Mindy
is definitely his best.

01:17:05.359 --> 01:17:07.361
Welcome to the family.

01:17:07.405 --> 01:17:09.799
-Hear, hear!
-[guests] Cheers!

01:17:09.842 --> 01:17:11.627
Cheers.

01:17:12.453 --> 01:17:17.197
♪smooth jazzy music

01:17:23.377 --> 01:17:25.292
[Jaffrey] It's for Christmas.

01:17:26.337 --> 01:17:27.599
The tree?

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:28.948
Oh, you don't say.

01:17:28.992 --> 01:17:31.081
I brought it in from outside.

01:17:31.429 --> 01:17:33.474
It looks like it
grew in here but...

01:17:33.518 --> 01:17:35.651
that tree grew outside.

01:17:36.913 --> 01:17:37.783
[Lucy] Elaine!

01:17:37.827 --> 01:17:39.263
-Hi.
-[Lucy] Hi!

01:17:39.306 --> 01:17:40.612
[Elaine] Have you seen Josh?

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:43.049
I think he went to
go find an Aspirin.

01:17:43.093 --> 01:17:44.398
He said he had a
bit of a headache.

01:17:44.442 --> 01:17:46.009
Ah.

01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:48.359
Anthony probably should have
gone with my prepared remarks.

01:17:48.402 --> 01:17:49.795
Mm.

01:17:49.839 --> 01:17:51.362
[Elaine] I'm glad you're here.

01:17:51.405 --> 01:17:53.190
Josh has been talking
about you for months.

01:17:53.233 --> 01:17:54.452
[Lucy] Oh, God.

01:17:54.495 --> 01:17:55.975
I cannot even imagine
what he's told you.

01:17:56.019 --> 01:17:58.456
I swear I am not that bad.

01:17:58.499 --> 01:18:03.243
He told me that you
drive him crazy...

01:18:03.287 --> 01:18:06.420
and that you
challenge him and that...

01:18:06.464 --> 01:18:08.945
you're as
strong-willed as he is.

01:18:09.249 --> 01:18:11.904
You know, I thought when Mindy
left him and he took that job at

01:18:11.948 --> 01:18:16.256
B&G that he had hit
rock bottom but...

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.606
now, I think it might be the
best thing that ever happened to

01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:20.434
him.

01:18:20.478 --> 01:18:22.088
[chuckles]

01:18:22.132 --> 01:18:24.743
And for what it's worth, I've
never seen him look at anyone

01:18:24.787 --> 01:18:27.267
the way he looks at you.

01:18:28.355 --> 01:18:29.356
-Ah!
-Hi!

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.837
There's my
beautiful groom, aww.

01:18:31.881 --> 01:18:32.925
Have you already lost your wife?

01:18:32.969 --> 01:18:34.318
[laughs] No, not yet.

01:18:34.361 --> 01:18:36.755
She's hiding in the
kitchen, eating in peace.

01:18:36.799 --> 01:18:38.322
[Elaine] Mm.

01:18:38.365 --> 01:18:40.454
Mom, you may need to head
back into the reception room.

01:18:40.498 --> 01:18:43.153
I think Dad's maybe
had one too many.

01:18:43.196 --> 01:18:44.067
Oh.

01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:46.417
Once more, unto the breach.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.332
If you ask me,
it's a Goddamn waste.

01:18:48.375 --> 01:18:51.074
MBA from Harvard and you spend
your days running errands and

01:18:51.117 --> 01:18:54.381
licking stamps so you can
flirt with some little intern.

01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:55.295
Intern?

01:18:55.339 --> 01:18:57.297
Maybe you should take a walk.

01:18:57.341 --> 01:18:58.516
"I don't want to be a doctor."

01:18:58.559 --> 01:19:00.474
At least do
something marginally noble.

01:19:00.518 --> 01:19:02.520
-[Elaine] Anthony...
-[Anthony] Join the Peace Corps.

01:19:02.563 --> 01:19:04.522
Go build wells in Nigeria.

01:19:04.565 --> 01:19:06.829
You don't think that
publishing is noble?

01:19:06.872 --> 01:19:08.352
Contributing to culture?

01:19:08.395 --> 01:19:10.397
I-- I don't think that he's
making books, Sweetheart.

01:19:10.441 --> 01:19:13.400
I think he's making coffee for
somebody who's making books.

01:19:13.444 --> 01:19:15.098
And by the way, it's
none of your business.

01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:17.448
Don't speak to her that way.

01:19:17.491 --> 01:19:19.929
Okay, well since you
know nothing about your son,

01:19:19.972 --> 01:19:21.713
I'll just-- I'll-- I'll
fill you in real quick.

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:24.760
Josh is the person that our
sales and finance divisions

01:19:24.803 --> 01:19:25.673
report to.

01:19:25.717 --> 01:19:27.588
They are scared shitless of him.

01:19:27.632 --> 01:19:30.374
I have seen grown men run around
like ants triple-checking their

01:19:30.417 --> 01:19:32.898
numbers because Josh
always finds their mistakes.

01:19:32.942 --> 01:19:33.986
Lucy, you don't have to.

01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:35.596
It's fine.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.989
I'm sorry, I know I'm making a
really big scene and I'm sorry.

01:19:37.033 --> 01:19:38.686
I-- I like all of you. [laughs]

01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:40.166
Um, except you.

01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:42.386
But I-- I can't listen to this.

01:19:42.429 --> 01:19:44.040
Oh, and for the
record, Josh's boss,

01:19:44.083 --> 01:19:47.217
who is CEO in title only, is a
sleazy toad who can barely tie

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:48.218
his own shoelaces.

01:19:48.261 --> 01:19:50.176
Josh runs that place.

01:19:50.568 --> 01:19:52.091
Actually, we both do.

01:19:52.135 --> 01:19:54.441
And the only reason that B&G
didn't completely implode after

01:19:54.485 --> 01:19:57.183
the merger is because Josh
oversaw a reduction of the

01:19:57.227 --> 01:19:59.577
workforce by 35
percent, and because of him,

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.187
200 people kept their jobs.

01:20:01.231 --> 01:20:02.362
And so he's not a doctor.

01:20:02.406 --> 01:20:03.842
Who the fuck cares?

01:20:03.886 --> 01:20:05.409
He's smart.

01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:07.628
Your son is tough and he has
made me a lot better at my job

01:20:07.672 --> 01:20:09.326
by having to compete with him.

01:20:09.369 --> 01:20:11.328
Don't get me wrong, he
drives me absolutely insane,

01:20:11.371 --> 01:20:12.851
which is apparently hereditary.

01:20:12.895 --> 01:20:14.940
But your son is amazing.

01:20:14.984 --> 01:20:15.898
And the fact that
you can't see that,

01:20:15.941 --> 01:20:18.248
that is a goddamn shame.

01:20:21.425 --> 01:20:24.471
In conclusion, uh,
congratulations to the bride and

01:20:24.515 --> 01:20:25.603
groom!

01:20:25.646 --> 01:20:27.823
Just amazing.

01:20:27.866 --> 01:20:30.390
Um, let's go home.

01:20:30.434 --> 01:20:32.740
Anthony, sir, it's
been a real treat.

01:20:32.784 --> 01:20:35.569
Elaine, it was
lovely meeting you.

01:20:36.614 --> 01:20:38.398
[whispering] I'll call you.

01:20:48.887 --> 01:20:51.411
[chuckles]

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.546
So, what now?

01:20:55.589 --> 01:20:57.591
-Naked time?
-[Josh] [laughs]

01:20:57.635 --> 01:20:59.071
After naked time?

01:20:59.115 --> 01:21:01.117
Rehydration.

01:21:05.338 --> 01:21:07.427
Lucy, I've had a
lot of women...

01:21:07.471 --> 01:21:10.561
I seriously hope there's
an end to that sentence.

01:21:10.604 --> 01:21:12.345
[laughs]

01:21:13.085 --> 01:21:15.827
I've had a lot of women tell me
that I'm-- I'm not the kind of

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:17.916
guy you settle down with.

01:21:18.482 --> 01:21:20.919
I'm the one-night-stand.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.183
And you think
that's what I'm doing?

01:21:24.227 --> 01:21:26.229
I hope not.

01:21:29.449 --> 01:21:31.495
I don't understand you.

01:21:31.538 --> 01:21:34.280
I seriously
thought you hated me.

01:21:34.672 --> 01:21:36.021
Never.

01:21:36.369 --> 01:21:39.068
Never, not for one second.

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:42.114
And I can prove it to you.

01:21:43.681 --> 01:21:45.465
All right, you
have to come in here.

01:21:45.509 --> 01:21:46.858
Okay.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.469
And I'm gonna need to take this.

01:21:49.513 --> 01:21:51.558
I thought you
weren't feeling naked time.

01:21:51.602 --> 01:21:53.038
[chuckles]

01:21:53.082 --> 01:21:54.170
You're kinda giving me
mixed signals here, Templeman.

01:21:54.213 --> 01:21:55.519
[laughs] We're not
going to the bed.

01:21:55.562 --> 01:21:59.044
You have to stand...right here.

01:21:59.088 --> 01:22:01.351
-[laughs] Okay.
-Now...

01:22:02.743 --> 01:22:04.745
tell me what you see.

01:22:04.789 --> 01:22:07.487
Um, well...

01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:10.751
my hair's a little scraggly
and my lipstick's faded.

01:22:10.795 --> 01:22:12.710
-You're perfect.
-[laughs]

01:22:12.753 --> 01:22:14.494
Guess again.

01:22:14.973 --> 01:22:16.932
[sighs] Oh!

01:22:17.584 --> 01:22:18.846
My dress!

01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:20.587
Look.

01:22:21.284 --> 01:22:22.894
Like a tree frog.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:24.591
[laughs]

01:22:24.635 --> 01:22:26.289
What exactly does that prove?

01:22:26.332 --> 01:22:29.553
Your dress isn't the only
thing that matches your eyes.

01:22:32.686 --> 01:22:34.601
Oh, my God.

01:22:34.645 --> 01:22:35.515
Wait, did you--

01:22:35.559 --> 01:22:36.777
How about this?

01:22:36.821 --> 01:22:38.954
Let's play a different game.

01:22:38.997 --> 01:22:40.912
The "Starting Over" game.

01:22:41.608 --> 01:22:42.783
Hi.

01:22:42.827 --> 01:22:45.003
I'm Joshua
Templeman, nice to meet you.

01:22:45.047 --> 01:22:46.918
Hi. [laughs]

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:48.528
Um...

01:22:48.572 --> 01:22:50.356
I'm Lucy Hutton.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:54.317
I'm from Charlotte, Vermont,
where they grow strawberries.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.189
And because of that, I'm
gonna call you "Shortcake."

01:22:57.233 --> 01:23:00.236
It'll be a dead
giveaway that I love you.

01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:03.717
You're freaking out.

01:23:03.761 --> 01:23:04.805
No.

01:23:04.849 --> 01:23:07.765
-[Josh] Don't freak out.
-No, I just...

01:23:08.331 --> 01:23:10.202
I just...

01:23:10.246 --> 01:23:12.291
I-- I am not-- I am
not prepared for this.

01:23:12.335 --> 01:23:13.771
What do you mean?

01:23:13.814 --> 01:23:15.381
After New Year's, one of
us is gonna be out of a job.

01:23:15.425 --> 01:23:18.428
Any relationship we tried, it
would be over before it started.

01:23:18.471 --> 01:23:19.559
Well, maybe not.

01:23:19.603 --> 01:23:20.996
Maybe nobody has to quit.

01:23:21.039 --> 01:23:22.432
No, this would never work.

01:23:22.475 --> 01:23:23.563
You know that, okay?

01:23:23.607 --> 01:23:24.825
We would kill each other.

01:23:24.869 --> 01:23:26.523
[Josh] [laughs]

01:23:26.566 --> 01:23:28.612
Luce, I know you.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:31.789
I know that you blot your
lips twice before you throw your

01:23:31.832 --> 01:23:33.704
tissue away.

01:23:34.444 --> 01:23:38.013
I know that your voice drops
an octave when you get upset.

01:23:38.274 --> 01:23:40.363
I know you chew your lower lip
when you're doing something you

01:23:40.406 --> 01:23:42.452
don't wanna do.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.846
And I know that
you're scared right now.

01:23:46.412 --> 01:23:48.675
But you don't have to be.

01:23:50.416 --> 01:23:52.418
I'm in this.

01:23:52.462 --> 01:23:54.594

[Richard] It's a dangerous
time for men these days, Josh.

01:25:21.464 --> 01:25:24.771
If we don't stick together,
manic pixie twits like Lucy

01:25:24.815 --> 01:25:27.861
Hutton, they're gonna be running
this country on lipstick and

01:25:27.905 --> 01:25:29.515
feelings.

01:25:29.559 --> 01:25:31.561
I can tell you I didn't start
this company to have my balls

01:25:31.604 --> 01:25:34.172
crushed by some
nitwit in a push-up bra.

01:25:34.216 --> 01:25:35.217
Do you hear me?

01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:36.305
Loud and clear.

01:25:36.348 --> 01:25:37.958
I have a vision
for this company,

01:25:38.002 --> 01:25:40.787
and I'm counting on
you to make it happen.

01:25:40.831 --> 01:25:42.659
So, do you have a strategy?

01:25:42.702 --> 01:25:43.921
-Do you have a plan?
-I do.

01:25:43.964 --> 01:25:46.010
It's already underway.

01:25:46.315 --> 01:25:48.491
I told her she'd back off if
you let her think that she could

01:25:48.534 --> 01:25:50.362
pet the pony. [laughs]

01:25:50.406 --> 01:25:52.190
I'm glad you took my advice.

01:25:52.234 --> 01:25:54.714
Is there anything else I can do
to help you cinch this thing?

01:25:54.758 --> 01:25:56.151
No.

01:25:56.194 --> 01:25:57.978
No, no, no, I-- I don't
need any help beating her.

01:25:58.022 --> 01:25:59.284
[Richard] All right,
I'm sure you don't.

01:25:59.328 --> 01:26:00.938
Get on it, then.

01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:05.334
Hey, are you free?

01:26:06.073 --> 01:26:08.641
I'm heading to the
coffeeshop right now.

01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:11.862
[ding]

01:26:17.128 --> 01:26:18.999
[Danny] So he's
sexually gaslighting you?

01:26:19.043 --> 01:26:21.219
That is diabolical.

01:26:21.263 --> 01:26:23.003
I guess it makes sense; you're
not gonna work as hard if you're

01:26:23.047 --> 01:26:24.918
crushing on him.

01:26:24.962 --> 01:26:27.747
I wonder what it's like to be
a dude who uses his raw animal

01:26:27.791 --> 01:26:29.967
magnetism as a weapon.

01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:31.969
Yeah, but it's
one thing to flirt.

01:26:32.012 --> 01:26:34.276
It's a whole other thing to
pretend like you have actual

01:26:34.319 --> 01:26:35.407
feelings.

01:26:35.451 --> 01:26:37.844
I just-- I feel
like such an idiot.

01:26:39.063 --> 01:26:40.978
Are you sure it's okay that
we're talking about all this?

01:26:41.021 --> 01:26:42.414
Yeah.

01:26:42.458 --> 01:26:44.808
I mean, I'm basically the
mayor of the Friendzone,

01:26:44.851 --> 01:26:48.855
so I'm hip, safe
space, carry on.

01:26:50.248 --> 01:26:53.773
I just cannot believe I let
myself get played like this.

01:26:54.905 --> 01:26:57.647
I mean, he seemed so sincere.

01:26:58.343 --> 01:27:00.780
Well, fear not,
my sweet friend.

01:27:00.824 --> 01:27:02.434
You are going to
nail that interview,

01:27:02.478 --> 01:27:06.046
get the job, and then order will
be restored to the universe.

01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:07.570
Yes.

01:27:07.613 --> 01:27:09.789
Well, justice demands that
Josh live a long life alone,

01:27:09.833 --> 01:27:11.574
sucking on Bexley's nasty nuts.

01:27:11.617 --> 01:27:13.271
-[laughs]
-[Lucy] So...

01:27:14.794 --> 01:27:17.057
-Oh, hey, Josh.
-What are you doing here?

01:27:17.101 --> 01:27:18.842
I was looking for you.

01:27:18.885 --> 01:27:21.279
Thought I'd join
you for a coffee.

01:27:21.627 --> 01:27:24.848
I don't like you enough
to get a coffee with you.

01:27:26.719 --> 01:27:28.678
My mistake.

01:27:31.376 --> 01:27:33.857
[whispering] Solid burn.

01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.380
[chuckles]

01:27:37.077 --> 01:27:38.905
[sighs]

01:27:38.949 --> 01:27:41.560
Do we have confirmation that
the London Review is featuring

01:27:41.604 --> 01:27:42.474
'Stripping Time?'

01:27:42.518 --> 01:27:44.084
CC'd you on the email.

01:27:44.128 --> 01:27:46.826
No, I'm looking at my inbox and
it's not here, you sociopath.

01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:50.482
Well, then you're either
blind or just lying, as usual.

01:27:50.526 --> 01:27:51.570
I don't lie.

01:27:51.614 --> 01:27:53.180
You lie all the time.

01:27:53.224 --> 01:27:55.270
You just don't see it as lying
because you tell people what

01:27:55.313 --> 01:27:56.445
they wanna hear.

01:27:56.488 --> 01:27:57.359
What?

01:27:57.402 --> 01:27:58.708
Name one time I've done that.

01:27:58.751 --> 01:28:01.885
You told me you
weren't interested in Danny.

01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:03.669
Wow.

01:28:04.322 --> 01:28:05.889
Wow.

01:28:05.932 --> 01:28:07.456
That is amazing.

01:28:07.499 --> 01:28:09.501
You are actually gonna play
this thing all the way through,

01:28:09.545 --> 01:28:10.894
aren't you?

01:28:10.937 --> 01:28:11.895
And see, that's
what I don't get.

01:28:11.938 --> 01:28:13.418
Throw me off my game, fine.

01:28:13.462 --> 01:28:15.028
Flirt with me, mess
with my head, whatever.

01:28:15.072 --> 01:28:17.466
But why would you want to keep
me from dating someone else?

01:28:17.509 --> 01:28:19.032
Danny is nice!

01:28:19.076 --> 01:28:19.946
And I'm not.

01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:22.035
I thought you were...

01:28:22.079 --> 01:28:24.299
somewhere under the
layers of psychological damage.

01:28:24.342 --> 01:28:27.650
But it turns out you would just
do whatever it takes to win and

01:28:27.693 --> 01:28:28.868
make your daddy proud.

01:28:28.912 --> 01:28:30.522
And you know what?

01:28:30.566 --> 01:28:33.308
I am so glad that I threw up all
over you 'cause I am this close

01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:34.091
to doing it again!

01:28:34.134 --> 01:28:35.440
What is wrong with you?!

01:28:35.484 --> 01:28:37.007
[whispering] I
heard you with Bexley!

01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:38.617
And?

01:28:38.661 --> 01:28:40.227
And I bet if he knew you'd had
a hand all the way up my skirt,

01:28:40.271 --> 01:28:41.925
he'd throw a
parade in your honor!

01:28:41.968 --> 01:28:44.406
-That's not--
-Hey, Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh!

01:28:44.449 --> 01:28:46.538
I'm gonna need those projections
on my desk by Friday.

01:28:46.582 --> 01:28:47.539
I don't have the time.

01:28:47.583 --> 01:28:48.671
Lucy can do it.

01:28:48.714 --> 01:28:50.063
[Richard] Hutton!

01:28:50.107 --> 01:28:51.978
Care to grow some hair
on your nuts and step up?

01:28:52.022 --> 01:28:53.632
You know,
Richard, I would love to,

01:28:53.676 --> 01:28:56.069
but I doubt a nitwit in a
push-up bra would be much help

01:28:56.113 --> 01:28:57.593
to you.

01:28:58.985 --> 01:29:02.989
Josh, projections,
on my desk Friday.

01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:06.297
There is no way in hell I am
letting you and Bexley destroy

You have a call at two with TLS,

I haven't seen
him since yesterday.

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.767
That's weird, right?

01:30:24.810 --> 01:30:25.985
The week of the presentation?

01:30:26.029 --> 01:30:28.379
He's-- he's up to something.

01:30:28.423 --> 01:30:30.903
I wouldn't put it past him.

01:30:31.513 --> 01:30:32.427
You ready for this?

01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:33.863
Hell yes.

01:30:33.906 --> 01:30:35.517
I will bring my A game.

[laughs]

01:31:05.895 --> 01:31:07.462
[Julie] Lucy!

01:31:07.505 --> 01:31:09.115
This is my boyfriend's niece,
Daisy -- the one I told you

01:31:09.159 --> 01:31:11.248
about for the internship.

01:31:11.901 --> 01:31:13.206
This is Daisy?

01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:15.208
Like the flower.

01:31:19.691 --> 01:31:21.476
[sighs]

01:31:23.129 --> 01:31:24.870
No.

01:31:26.219 --> 01:31:27.307
Absolutely not.

01:31:27.351 --> 01:31:28.395
No, but you said that--

01:31:28.439 --> 01:31:30.397
I got steamrolled
and you know it.

01:31:30.441 --> 01:31:32.791
I'm sorry, you seem
like a lovely girl,

01:31:32.835 --> 01:31:34.619
but you actually couldn't
have picked a worse time.

01:31:34.663 --> 01:31:37.143
And you still haven't
turned in your monthly report.

01:31:37.187 --> 01:31:38.188
Oh, yes, I wanted to
talk to you about that--

01:31:38.231 --> 01:31:39.406
[Lucy] No, don't
worry about it.

01:31:39.450 --> 01:31:40.538
I already talked to
Alan, I got the numbers,

01:31:40.582 --> 01:31:42.279
and I did the
report myself...again.

01:31:42.322 --> 01:31:43.846
[sighs] You're such an angel.

01:31:43.889 --> 01:31:45.412
No, I'm not an angel.

01:31:45.456 --> 01:31:47.676
I'm a patsy and I am done.

01:31:47.719 --> 01:31:49.286
It's a migraine or
a sprained wrist.

01:31:49.329 --> 01:31:51.680
I mean, three months ago, you
couldn't turn in the report

01:31:51.723 --> 01:31:54.204
because a bird flew in your face
coming off the subway and you

01:31:54.247 --> 01:31:55.945
were too
distraught to concentrate.

01:31:55.988 --> 01:31:57.381
It was a big bird...

01:31:57.424 --> 01:31:59.078
And while I sympathize
with your various plights--

01:31:59.122 --> 01:32:00.819
You don't sound sympathetic.

01:32:00.863 --> 01:32:02.125
She doesn't sound sympathetic.

01:32:02.168 --> 01:32:04.736
I'm gonna have to
ask you to do your job.

01:32:07.173 --> 01:32:09.567
I'm disappointed in you.

01:32:09.611 --> 01:32:11.221
Well...

01:32:13.919 --> 01:32:15.660
[Josh] Impressive.

01:32:15.704 --> 01:32:16.966
[Lucy] Thank you.

01:32:17.009 --> 01:32:19.229
Not that I...need
your validation.

01:32:19.272 --> 01:32:20.883
[woman] Thank you for coming.

01:32:20.926 --> 01:32:21.884
Lucy Hutton?

01:32:21.927 --> 01:32:23.189
You're up next.

01:32:23.233 --> 01:32:24.887
Okay. [sighs]

01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:30.414
One thing...

01:32:31.023 --> 01:32:34.157
If you get this job, are you
actually gonna let Bexley gut

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.333
the literary department?

01:32:36.986 --> 01:32:38.553
It's his business.

01:32:38.596 --> 01:32:40.163
He can do what he wants with it.

01:32:40.206 --> 01:32:41.599
[scoffs]

01:32:41.643 --> 01:32:42.861
Okay.

01:32:42.905 --> 01:32:45.124
That's all I needed to know.

01:32:46.648 --> 01:32:49.868
This is the first chapter of
a new book from best-selling

01:32:49.912 --> 01:32:52.479
author Emily Powery.

01:32:52.523 --> 01:32:57.180
I propose creating a cross-media
platform so that people can

01:32:57.223 --> 01:33:00.749
download e-books or audiobooks
and then have conversations with

01:33:00.792 --> 01:33:03.186
other readers and the writer.

01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:04.361
How would that work?

01:33:04.404 --> 01:33:06.319
Well, once you
finished a chapter,

01:33:06.363 --> 01:33:09.148
you are then directed to a
community group to discuss the

01:33:09.192 --> 01:33:10.323
story.

01:33:10.367 --> 01:33:12.630
And the writer is
part of that community.

01:33:12.674 --> 01:33:14.589
They publish a
chapter at a time,

01:33:14.632 --> 01:33:16.373
like the old 19th
century serials,

01:33:16.416 --> 01:33:19.158
and then join the conversation
with the readers before they

01:33:19.202 --> 01:33:21.160
write the next chapter.

01:33:21.204 --> 01:33:22.814
Interesting.

01:33:22.858 --> 01:33:24.773
If you turn to section two of
the document in front of you,

01:33:24.816 --> 01:33:27.993
you will see the
budget that I'm proposing.

01:33:29.299 --> 01:33:30.648
[exhales deeply]

01:33:30.692 --> 01:33:34.434
They seriously grilled
me on the numbers but...

01:33:34.478 --> 01:33:35.914
I think I held my own.

01:33:35.958 --> 01:33:37.307
I'm sure you blew them away.

01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:39.265
And I have to say,
whether or not I get this job,

01:33:39.309 --> 01:33:41.398
this whole thing, it...

01:33:41.441 --> 01:33:43.879
it did kinda wake me up.

01:33:45.184 --> 01:33:46.969
Well, here's a
little something.

01:33:47.012 --> 01:33:48.361
Oh, my God.

01:33:48.405 --> 01:33:49.406
A Peacock edition?

01:33:49.449 --> 01:33:50.886
Helen!

01:33:51.364 --> 01:33:54.019
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:33:54.063 --> 01:33:58.197
Mr. Darcy was such a
great romantic hero:

01:33:58.241 --> 01:34:00.373
inscrutable, misunderstood.

01:34:00.417 --> 01:34:01.766
I don't know.

01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:04.029
I think she might be
setting up a false expectation.

01:34:04.073 --> 01:34:05.770
Sometimes...

01:34:05.814 --> 01:34:07.337
guy's just an asshole.

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:09.426
[Helen] [laughs] That has
certainly been my experience.

01:34:09.469 --> 01:34:10.732
[ding]

01:34:10.775 --> 01:34:13.648
And it's gonna look
nice in your library.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.392
[laughter]

01:34:19.436 --> 01:34:21.438
It's a great promotion for you.

[Josh] Thank you.

01:34:23.353 --> 01:34:24.441
Lucy!

01:34:24.484 --> 01:34:26.312
We were just about
to come find you.

01:34:29.098 --> 01:34:30.926
Congratulations.

01:34:31.491 --> 01:34:33.232
You earned it.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.757
Well...

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:38.977
we've all had a big
decision to make today.

01:34:39.021 --> 01:34:41.632
I think it goes without saying
that this merger has been a

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:46.768
little bumpy, but I think that
B&G is positioned now to become

01:34:46.811 --> 01:34:49.771
a major literary powerhouse.

01:34:49.814 --> 01:34:54.036
I know first-hand that no one is
more savvy or tenacious than its

01:34:54.079 --> 01:34:56.647
new managing director...

01:34:58.693 --> 01:35:00.303
Lucy Hutton.

01:35:00.346 --> 01:35:02.609
-Congratulations, Lucy.
-What?

01:35:02.653 --> 01:35:04.873
[cheers and applause]

01:35:04.916 --> 01:35:07.136
[Carl] Way to go, Luce.

01:35:07.702 --> 01:35:08.833
[Lucy] What?

01:35:08.877 --> 01:35:10.443
Wait, but she just said that--

01:35:10.487 --> 01:35:12.445
I took a job as acquisitions
editor at Harper Collins last

01:35:12.489 --> 01:35:13.055
week.

01:35:13.098 --> 01:35:14.491
Son of a bitch.

01:35:14.534 --> 01:35:16.493
So when you said you
didn't need help beating me--

01:35:16.536 --> 01:35:19.235
It's because I had
decided to resign.

01:35:19.278 --> 01:35:20.453
Why didn't you tell me?

01:35:20.497 --> 01:35:22.673
[Helen] That would be my fault.

01:35:22.717 --> 01:35:24.327
I begged him not
to say anything.

01:35:24.370 --> 01:35:25.763
I am sorry, Lucy.

01:35:25.807 --> 01:35:29.245
Just fighting with Josh
lit such a fire under you,

01:35:29.288 --> 01:35:32.509
I knew if you kept that drive,
you'd beat everyone else and get

01:35:32.552 --> 01:35:33.945
the job.

01:35:33.989 --> 01:35:34.859
[Annabelle] She would've
kicked your ass too, Josh!

01:35:34.903 --> 01:35:35.947
[laughter]

01:35:35.991 --> 01:35:37.557
[Josh] Fair enough.

01:35:37.819 --> 01:35:41.910
Luce, you are the heart and
soul of this place and everybody

01:35:41.953 --> 01:35:43.346
knows it.

01:35:43.389 --> 01:35:45.914

needs: more heart and soul.

01:35:47.567 --> 01:35:48.786
shut up.

01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:50.788
In fact, always just
keep your mouth shut,

01:35:50.832 --> 01:35:52.094
as a general rule.

You're fired!

01:35:56.533 --> 01:35:58.274

What's that?

You are the nice guy.

01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:14.594

No, no, no, we have a
contract with O'Brien,

01:36:39.228 --> 01:36:40.577
so if he wants to
switch publishers,

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:41.404
you're gonna have
to buy him out.

[Lucy VO] So, it turns out love
and hate aren't as similar as I

01:36:55.157 --> 01:36:55.679
thought.

[Lucy VO] Sure, they both get
your blood pumping and make you

want to do crazy things
to someone else's body.

01:37:03.252 --> 01:37:04.644
