00:04.000 --> 00:07.457
<i>Ladies and Gentleman,</i>
<i>welcome to violence...</i>

00:07.917 --> 00:09.157
<i>the word and the act.</i>

00:09.795 --> 00:13.595
<i>While violence cloaks itself</i>
<i>in a plethora of disguises,</i>

00:13.961 --> 00:17.091
<i>its favorite mantle still remains sex.</i>

00:18.048 --> 00:20.390
<i>Violence devours all it touches,</i>

00:20.662 --> 00:23.437
<i>it's voracious appetite rarely fulfilled.</i>

00:23.791 --> 00:27.626
<i>Yet violence doesn't only destroy,</i>
<i>it creates and molds as well.</i>

00:27.943 --> 00:31.291
<i>Let's examine closely then this</i>
<i>dangerously evil creation,</i>

00:31.481 --> 00:36.345
<i>this new breed, encased and contained</i>
<i>within the supple skin of woman.</i>

00:37.259 --> 00:40.389
<i>The softness is there, the</i>
<i>unmistakable smell of female.</i>

00:41.287 --> 00:43.501
<i>The surface, shiny and silken.</i>

00:43.882 --> 00:45.954
<i>The body yielding yet wanton.</i>

00:46.382 --> 00:49.822
<i>But a word of caution...</i>
<i>handle with care and don't drop your guard.</i>

00:50.130 --> 00:53.974
<i>This rapacious new breed</i>
<i>prowls both alone and in packs,</i>

00:54.282 --> 00:57.631
<i>operating at any level, any time,</i>
<i>anywhere, and with anybody!</i>

00:57.993 --> 00:59.007
<i>Who are they?</i>

00:59.479 --> 01:01.446
<i>One might be your secretary,</i>

01:01.806 --> 01:03.472
<i>your doctor's receptionist...</i>

01:03.758 --> 01:05.775
<i>or a dancer in a Go-Go club!</i>

01:36.465 --> 01:38.319
Go baby, go!

01:38.539 --> 01:40.382
Go, go, go!

01:44.181 --> 01:45.513
Go, baby, go!

01:48.023 --> 01:49.600
- Come on, let's go!
- Go baby!

01:50.984 --> 01:51.984
Yeeeoww!

01:53.716 --> 01:56.224
Girly, let's go!
Let's go, girl! Harder! Faster!

03:45.237 --> 03:47.450
Woooo!
Ah, this is a gas!

03:48.630 --> 03:51.477
Aaaah! Ooooh!

04:05.191 --> 04:06.232
Wooo!

04:12.158 --> 04:15.413
How long you going to let that
kooky broad showboat like that?

04:22.326 --> 04:23.392
Go get her.

04:24.230 --> 04:27.729
So I gotta get wet because
Lady Godiva wants to swim?

04:50.351 --> 04:53.989
Hey Rosie baby!
I got it all warmed up for ya!

04:54.089 --> 05:00.571
Go ahead, the sponge, soak it up.
I'm gonna love squeezing you out.

05:21.043 --> 05:23.164
You'll never make the Olympics, baby!

05:23.264 --> 05:25.945
You got a real problem, eh?

05:26.045 --> 05:27.635
She wears the pants alright,

05:27.735 --> 05:30.205
but somehow she always
strips her gears.

05:30.305 --> 05:34.896
Alright!
You washed, now I'm a gonna spin dry you!

05:50.182 --> 05:51.604
- Ooh!
- Get off!

06:10.211 --> 06:14.306
Now! Natural, huh?
You on your back, huh?

06:16.938 --> 06:19.933
Your heels didn't get round from walkin'!

06:20.289 --> 06:23.817
Alright, knock it off!
I've seen better fights on a light show!

06:24.782 --> 06:26.762
You wanna prove something chickies?

06:28.437 --> 06:30.780
Let's see who the real chicken is.

07:42.561 --> 07:47.587
You know, you sure do have a funny way
of gettin' your kicks... real funny.

07:47.942 --> 07:50.278
But then you never were dull, Varla.

07:56.370 --> 07:58.851
Easy baby, you're almost a fire hazard.

08:03.833 --> 08:06.422
Break out some sauce so
Rosie can clear her throat.

08:09.494 --> 08:11.318
You're all shook up, aren't ya baby?

08:22.491 --> 08:26.381
Here Rosie baby,
pop the top before you blow your own.

08:26.527 --> 08:29.042
Hey, don't you get enough
of that at the joint?

08:29.142 --> 08:32.789
There's no audience here,
give your hips a rest.

08:32.890 --> 08:35.018
My motor never runs
down, baby...

08:35.138 --> 08:38.058
And besides, you're such
a wonderful audience.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.018
We just got out of that place

08:40.118 --> 08:42.578
and she's still got to go
into her routine, eh?

08:44.957 --> 08:47.237
So? Working up a new routine.

08:49.957 --> 08:53.500
Hey, can't be my agent,
he couldn't afford the gas.

08:54.527 --> 08:57.632
My desert fan club, no doubt.

09:02.193 --> 09:05.401
Uh, they went that-a-way, partner.

09:07.574 --> 09:08.838
How could they with you here?

09:08.938 --> 09:12.220
I told you girls I had a fan club out here.

09:13.616 --> 09:16.332
These things just are
not made for long rides.

09:16.961 --> 09:17.961
Nice set of wheels.

09:18.133 --> 09:20.165
Would you like to look under my hood?

09:22.409 --> 09:23.795
Been running some timing trials?

09:23.895 --> 09:25.656
We know how fast we can go.

09:26.131 --> 09:28.136
You could time that heap
with an hourglass.

09:29.964 --> 09:31.710
Someone mention my figure?

09:32.477 --> 09:34.305
In that outfit, what's to mention?

09:34.787 --> 09:36.617
Shall I set up shop here, Tommy?

09:37.368 --> 09:39.286
Do you girls mind if we run
some timing trials?

09:39.386 --> 09:41.216
This is about the best measured
strip around.

09:41.835 --> 09:45.524
Be our guest...
might be kind of interesting.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.251
Okay.

10:02.494 --> 10:05.071
You're sure we're not,
uh, crowding you, eh?

10:05.171 --> 10:08.103
Oh no, I'm glad you're here.
Uh, would you like a soft drink?

10:08.647 --> 10:10.337
You're putting me on, no?

10:10.935 --> 10:12.174
A soft drinks yet.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.534
Honey, we don't like
nothing soft.

10:15.814 --> 10:17.734
Everything we touch is hard.

10:19.033 --> 10:20.257
All set hon.

10:20.759 --> 10:24.541
Clock me from when I hit that marker
there, 'til I finish at that one.

10:24.939 --> 10:27.943
You'll see a puff of smoke from my
exhaust when I cut in the motor.

10:28.043 --> 10:29.491
That's when you hit the
magic button.

10:39.003 --> 10:41.550
He's such a nut about
that car and driving fast...

10:41.650 --> 10:43.572
Driving fast is fun, honey.

10:43.672 --> 10:45.582
I don't know why I worry
about him,

10:45.682 --> 10:49.372
he's the champion of our car club
and first in safety points too!

10:49.926 --> 10:53.332
I'm sorry... I seem to be using
up all the oxygen.

10:53.632 --> 10:54.767
What's your story?

10:54.867 --> 10:56.856
You heard the questions girls.

10:56.956 --> 11:00.742
Uh, this is what we do, at a
hundred and twenty five per,

11:00.842 --> 11:03.227
less taxes and social security.

11:03.327 --> 11:06.020
Really? You got it made. I do that for fun.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.163
Well then let's have fun, baby.

11:10.741 --> 11:13.001
Hey, the kid's alright!

11:13.123 --> 11:16.182
If I ever get a severe case of
love sickness,

11:16.282 --> 11:18.890
you know who can fill in for
me at the club.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.738
Oh, I forgot to time him, he'll be
so disappointed.

11:23.838 --> 11:27.726
Well, make up a time. You know,
a time like you know. A record.

11:28.922 --> 11:32.394
How'd it go babe?
It felt fast, real fast.

11:32.494 --> 11:34.814
I forgot, honey. I didn't clock you.

11:35.314 --> 11:39.807
We all started talking... or I guess I did.
I forgot, I'm sorry.

11:40.931 --> 11:45.867
Oh... okay, forget it.
I didn't hurt anything except my motor.

11:47.270 --> 11:53.413
Here buddy, relax...
The sun's still high, you can try it again.

11:53.540 --> 11:57.850
I'll even time you this time...
and I got a perfect movement.

11:59.023 --> 12:03.037
What's so exciting about racing against
a clock anyway? What's it prove?

12:03.137 --> 12:06.258
Well, it's like a runner
trying to improve his time.

12:06.389 --> 12:08.314
He trains his body
to get the most out of it.

12:08.414 --> 12:10.192
I work on this baby the
same way...

12:10.292 --> 12:11.650
trying to get maximum
performance.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.838
What's it mean if you don't beat anybody?

12:13.938 --> 12:15.752
But I do, I beat their time.

12:15.958 --> 12:18.030
Is that how you got cutie pie
over there?

12:18.130 --> 12:20.169
By beating some guy's time?

12:20.659 --> 12:23.646
No, you're not the type.

12:24.136 --> 12:29.028
You're, uh, the All-American boy.
A safety-first Clyde.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.497
Are you trying to say something?

12:30.597 --> 12:33.623
I never <b>try</b> anything... I just do it.

12:33.723 --> 12:38.313
Like I don't beat clocks... just people.
Wanna try me?

12:38.413 --> 12:39.929
I don't have to prove anything.

12:47.863 --> 12:52.483
His car is okay, just the color
needs changing.

12:53.321 --> 12:55.048
Like maybe yellow?

12:55.369 --> 12:56.608
I think you're all being unfair.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.650
What's so important about
beating people?

12:58.750 --> 13:00.838
And what's so wrong with a friendly race?

13:01.165 --> 13:02.917
Now she makes sense.

13:03.094 --> 13:06.261
How 'bout it kids?
A nice friendly little rally,

13:06.362 --> 13:10.126
just once around the circular marker.
Just three little curves.

13:10.226 --> 13:13.165
Sounds like fun, I'll be the starter.
No gun, but I got a whistle.

13:14.086 --> 13:19.226
How 'bout it, handsome?
I'll bet you're a real tiger in disguise.

13:19.444 --> 13:20.717
You got a deal.

14:00.763 --> 14:02.661
C'mon! Hurry!

14:40.520 --> 14:42.981
C'mon Tommy, hurry!
Just a little more, c'mon!

15:47.461 --> 15:49.212
Tommy, Tommy!

15:57.031 --> 15:58.774
What happened out there, is he alright?

15:58.874 --> 16:02.280
He's alright, he just
lost control of his bomb.

16:02.380 --> 16:04.021
Nearly creamed us both.

16:04.122 --> 16:07.220
What's, uh, our hero doing out there?
Saying his prayers?

16:07.320 --> 16:09.517
He should, he's got
a lot to be thankful for!

16:09.617 --> 16:10.678
Look, I better go!

16:13.077 --> 16:15.196
What's your hurry, honey?
He's not gonna run away!

16:15.296 --> 16:17.230
There's no hurry, only
I belong with him now.

16:17.330 --> 16:19.298
It's all my fault, he didn't
even want to race.

16:19.398 --> 16:20.562
Look, I better go!

16:20.845 --> 16:22.570
I know, honey, we understand.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.649
You wanna take your little
stopwatch and go home.

16:24.853 --> 16:27.949
Those are very sensitive, they break
out of balance very easy!

16:28.049 --> 16:29.574
Like Clyde lost control?

16:29.674 --> 16:30.767
You're overdressed!

16:30.867 --> 16:32.289
You won't be needing
this anymore

16:32.389 --> 16:34.719
and I think your boyfriend's had
his gut full of races!

16:34.829 --> 16:36.745
Listen!
Give it back!

16:37.114 --> 16:39.504
That's Tommy's, he values that.
He won it!

16:39.696 --> 16:41.353
Good! Now let him win it back!

16:42.165 --> 16:44.450
Tommy! Tommy!

16:47.800 --> 16:51.665
Let's just time Lancelot as he
comes charging to the rescue!

16:53.207 --> 16:54.248
What's going on here?

16:54.348 --> 16:56.611
Three and a half seconds, champ,
you were great!

16:56.711 --> 16:57.584
What's the matter?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.680
The watch, she won't
give it back to me!

16:59.903 --> 17:00.903
Let's have it.

17:04.910 --> 17:06.686
You've got a weird sense of humor.

17:06.787 --> 17:08.479
Try again, I get funnier.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.887
Look, I don't know what the
hell your point is, but I don't...

17:10.988 --> 17:13.448
The point is of no return...
and you've reached it!

17:13.674 --> 17:16.318
You can still climb in that kiddie car
and take a hike...

17:16.612 --> 17:19.151
unless you can fight better
than you can drive!

17:45.069 --> 17:46.069
Ha!

17:47.370 --> 17:48.370
Ha!

17:48.470 --> 17:50.070
You'll kill him, stop!

17:51.821 --> 17:54.156
You can still drive away, buster!

17:55.857 --> 17:58.878
Yeah... maybe you're right.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.294
Stop it! Stop it!

18:04.680 --> 18:06.163
C'mon babe, let's get out of here.

18:06.585 --> 18:07.585
Turn around!

18:09.387 --> 18:12.282
Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha!

18:17.434 --> 18:20.874
Plot this stiff in his heap.
He's had a bad accident.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.991
Go help her.
We've gotta move, and fast.

18:51.114 --> 18:53.480
Yes, ma'am!
What can I do for you today?

18:53.683 --> 18:56.038
Just your job, squirrel.
Fill it up!

18:56.380 --> 18:57.491
Yes, ma'am.

19:14.443 --> 19:17.494
Right fender, Einstein!

19:17.609 --> 19:18.789
Oh! Yes, ma'am.

19:20.007 --> 19:22.649
I, I ain't never seen one
of these kind before, heh.

19:57.983 --> 19:59.070
Just passin' through, huh?

19:59.170 --> 20:00.345
Boy, that motor's sure hot,

20:00.445 --> 20:02.621
you gals really must've been movin'
on these little machines.

20:02.721 --> 20:04.661
Yes sir, the thrill of the
open road.

20:04.761 --> 20:07.782
New places, new people and
new sites of interest.

20:07.985 --> 20:11.029
You know, that's what I believe in,
seein' America first.

20:11.129 --> 20:13.270
You won't find it down there, Columbus.

20:16.692 --> 20:19.611
Heavy sleeper, huh?
Boy, she's sure got a nice tan.

20:19.997 --> 20:21.431
You know, with them new
suits they're makin',

20:21.531 --> 20:23.749
I bet they helpin' the
sun tan oil sales...

20:23.850 --> 20:25.150
all that skin to cover.

20:25.982 --> 20:28.572
Yes sir. Man, the world's
sure movin' fast.

20:29.110 --> 20:31.491
Topless suits and pop top cans...

20:31.663 --> 20:35.724
We got two more cars to go, eightball,
don't make a career out of it.

20:51.107 --> 20:53.931
When the Goldilocks wakes up,
we're in trouble.

20:54.138 --> 20:56.449
We're in trouble whether
she wakes up or not.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.196
What's keepin' her out?

20:58.296 --> 21:01.673
I gave her a pill,
she's good for another two hours.

21:01.773 --> 21:04.415
Ah, you should have stuffed her
in the car with the friend.

21:05.029 --> 21:06.449
She's the only eyewitness.

21:06.649 --> 21:08.137
Not the only witness.

21:08.539 --> 21:11.367
But then you two couldn't really
be called witnesses.

21:11.521 --> 21:13.225
Willing, helpful witnesses.

21:13.325 --> 21:14.598
People who could have
stopped something

21:14.698 --> 21:16.277
from happening but didn't!

21:16.498 --> 21:19.073
In California they're called
accessories to the crime!

21:19.173 --> 21:23.696
Oh, you're cute.
Like a velvet glove cast in iron,

21:23.796 --> 21:27.193
and like the gas chamber, Varla,
a real fun gal.

21:27.293 --> 21:31.236
Not so loud, eh?
Chester's dense, but not dead.

21:32.753 --> 21:35.026
What now?
We've got gas, where do we go?

21:35.435 --> 21:37.084
That'll be $13.50.

21:37.184 --> 21:38.244
You can leave the oil.

21:41.127 --> 21:44.431
What a hunk of stuff! Woof!

21:44.531 --> 21:47.286
Hey, he's a big one, ain't he?
Got muscles all the way to his ears.

21:47.386 --> 21:48.497
They call him "the Vegetable",

21:48.597 --> 21:50.768
he's kind of a nut, and his
old man's a bigger one.

21:50.868 --> 21:52.426
Hey, there's the old man now!
That's him.

21:52.526 --> 21:53.867
The old man, he's a cripple.

21:53.967 --> 21:56.471
Railroad accident, sliced him
up real bad.

21:56.571 --> 21:59.097
Tried to save a girl, kind of
queered his mind too.

21:59.197 --> 22:00.307
Specially about women.

22:00.492 --> 22:02.537
Course they gave him a big hunk
of money for a settlement.

22:02.637 --> 22:04.407
Don't nobody know how
much it was.

22:04.825 --> 22:05.791
Never has deposited it.

22:05.891 --> 22:08.506
Like I say, he's a nut.
Don't believe in banks.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.402
My guess is he hid it out there
in the desert someplace.

22:11.532 --> 22:13.345
Hates everybody though,
hates everybody.

22:13.445 --> 22:15.141
Course with all that money
he can afford to.

22:15.241 --> 22:16.745
Don't nobody like him
neither.

22:17.193 --> 22:19.705
Why he could leave town tomorrow
and nobody'd even stir.

22:21.052 --> 22:24.325
It's kind of sad, though.
All that money and nobody to enjoy it.

22:24.631 --> 22:26.936
Let's split, but don't follow too close.

22:41.715 --> 22:43.162
Hey! Hey!

22:44.533 --> 22:46.156
You forgot your stamps!

22:52.422 --> 22:57.935
Oh well.
297 more books and I'll own the station.

24:05.512 --> 24:08.277
You dig the muscle or the scratch, Varla?

24:09.092 --> 24:10.305
I'll never knock muscle,

24:11.019 --> 24:13.245
but it's even better when
you've got bread to enjoy it.

24:13.641 --> 24:14.701
And it's in there...

24:14.941 --> 24:18.101
enough to buy ourselves
a lot of swingin' miles.

24:18.329 --> 24:20.665
Enough money to lose somebody, eh?

24:20.789 --> 24:25.589
A perfect place to lose anybody,
but this little doll's our cover story.

24:26.503 --> 24:28.591
Her boyfriend was killed
in a racing accident.

24:28.691 --> 24:31.326
She flipped...
ran away from home.

24:31.936 --> 24:34.753
Her family's big socially, and
doesn't want any publicity,

24:34.853 --> 24:36.541
so they asked us to
find the girl.

24:36.956 --> 24:37.956
We found her...

24:38.713 --> 24:41.780
Just like we're gonna find a big
hunk of that long green.

24:42.396 --> 24:46.749
Oh, that is so phony,
it's almost believable.

24:46.849 --> 24:49.933
You don't have to believe it,
honey, just act it.

24:50.619 --> 24:53.843
Now let's move,
but let's take the back door.

26:18.602 --> 26:19.602
Cool it!

26:19.702 --> 26:22.156
Or you're gonna get the same
thing your boyfriend got.

26:28.970 --> 26:31.279
There slim, now you can
get as vocal as you want.

26:43.530 --> 26:46.094
Boy, that old character must be a kook.

26:46.996 --> 26:49.242
All that bread and livin' in
a dump like this.

26:49.648 --> 26:52.466
Smashed cars, busted-out buses...

26:53.151 --> 26:57.030
but all good stashes.
Great place to hide a hunk of loot.

26:57.416 --> 27:00.966
I'm gonna start checkin' it out.
You keep an eye on sweetie pie.

27:01.066 --> 27:02.905
She gets too physical,
give her a pill.

27:03.005 --> 27:04.625
They're in the glove compartment
of my bomber.

27:04.725 --> 27:09.201
White ones for the nod off, and yellow
ones for the big wake up.

27:10.057 --> 27:12.184
Ah, what you got for sin, Varla?

27:12.322 --> 27:15.845
That depends, boom boom, on
what you got in mind.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.294
When you decide, let me know.

27:32.142 --> 27:33.920
You'll go too far.

27:34.020 --> 27:40.173
Just once you'll go too far and you'll
find your hide tacked to a tree.

27:41.502 --> 27:44.013
Sometimes I see her try
and figure me.

27:44.378 --> 27:46.738
I can't even figure myself.

27:56.994 --> 28:00.000
Your brother Kurt's
growin' away from us, boy.

28:00.852 --> 28:03.082
Cooks a meal, and then to readin'.

28:05.193 --> 28:07.852
Fifty bucks for three
lousy books...

28:08.645 --> 28:10.492
There ain't a picture in
one of 'em.

28:12.225 --> 28:13.307
Yeah...

28:14.560 --> 28:18.026
He forgets easy what that money cost me.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.277
Just waitin' for me to die...
or maybe just kill me and take it.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.282
But we won't let him though, will we boy?

28:27.735 --> 28:28.913
Boy.

28:32.177 --> 28:34.335
Wh... what do you want me to do, pa?

28:36.467 --> 28:38.066
Git another girl?

28:38.580 --> 28:40.048
No, it's too soon for that.

28:41.138 --> 28:43.140
You were too rough the last time!

28:44.235 --> 28:46.849
You gotta be more careful, boy!

28:47.320 --> 28:51.131
When you hurt somebody
the authorities get aroused.

28:54.439 --> 28:57.589
What do they know about hurtin' and pain?

29:01.319 --> 29:03.595
We're payin' 'em back, boy.

29:06.155 --> 29:08.083
Each woman a payment.

29:08.731 --> 29:10.457
You see anything interesting?

29:10.832 --> 29:13.783
What's with the strong arm bit?
Or couldn't you tell I was a girl?

29:13.883 --> 29:17.286
Ain't no doubt about your gender, girly.

29:18.123 --> 29:20.125
The question is what are you doing here?

29:21.322 --> 29:25.413
Seems like a week can't go by
without somebody messin' around.

29:27.313 --> 29:30.639
Well alright, what are you doing here?
'Sides trespassin'.

29:30.753 --> 29:33.202
My girlfriends and I have
been driving all day.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.410
We thought this was a deserted ranch.

29:35.510 --> 29:38.268
Spotted the water tower and
we were running a little hot,

29:38.368 --> 29:40.208
so we thought we'd take
on a little water.

29:40.564 --> 29:42.455
We're not used to this desert driving.

29:44.090 --> 29:48.433
They let 'em vote, smoke, and drive,
even put 'em in pants.

29:48.533 --> 29:51.688
So what do you get?
A Democrat for President.

29:51.936 --> 29:55.238
A lot of smoke up your chimney,
Russian roulette on the highway.

29:55.338 --> 29:57.888
You can't even tell brother
from sister...

29:58.231 --> 30:00.179
...'less you meet 'em head on.

30:00.279 --> 30:02.088
I've been gone a long time.

30:02.608 --> 30:06.087
If I'm not back soon my friends'll start
worrying and go looking for law.

30:06.187 --> 30:08.697
Well, they're gonna have to
yell damn loud.

30:08.797 --> 30:11.007
There ain't a phone within
five miles.

30:11.911 --> 30:16.490
'Side, uh, if anybody's gonna
notify any law, it's gonna be me.

30:17.168 --> 30:18.637
You best be movin' along.

30:18.737 --> 30:21.027
The desert's not a safe place
for girls alone.

30:21.814 --> 30:23.286
We'll be out in a hurry.

30:24.276 --> 30:25.966
But could we use a little
of your water?

30:26.231 --> 30:27.454
Help yourself.

30:27.714 --> 30:31.942
Just remember, uh, there's a meter on
that tank and it's still workin'.

30:36.342 --> 30:38.478
Boy, she's a cold one alright...

30:38.923 --> 30:43.700
More stallion than mare.
It's too much for one man to handle.

30:44.026 --> 30:45.656
Then again, you never can tell.

30:45.756 --> 30:50.606
She might just gentle down real nice
with the right halter.

30:54.746 --> 30:56.634
Oh, this is such a gas!

30:57.733 --> 30:58.815
Okay cupcake.

30:58.915 --> 31:01.125
We're gonna let you have a little freedom
so you can wash up.

31:01.795 --> 31:04.663
Any tricks and I'll be massaging
your back with a club.

31:04.763 --> 31:08.203
Why do you bother with her, eh?
She's nothing but trouble.

31:08.303 --> 31:09.622
I got my reasons!

31:09.893 --> 31:11.195
I'm gonna take the gag out.

31:11.295 --> 31:13.615
One loud sound you get enough
pills stuffed down you

31:13.715 --> 31:15.096
to sleep a week, you
understand?

31:16.620 --> 31:17.895
There.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.843
What're you gonna do with me?

31:20.453 --> 31:21.675
Nothing if you're smart.

31:21.775 --> 31:25.885
All I wanna do is go home.
Oh please let me go home!

31:26.164 --> 31:28.114
Oh I bet you do...

31:28.214 --> 31:31.604
and then ten minutes later every cop
in the state'd be after us.

31:32.028 --> 31:37.146
Plus the FBI.
A small matter of, um, kidnapping, eh?

31:37.410 --> 31:40.227
Oh god, I promise I won't say anything.

31:40.327 --> 31:42.124
I'll tell 'em it was an accident.

31:42.309 --> 31:44.324
That's it, I'll tell 'em it
was an accident!

31:44.771 --> 31:47.194
Oh, but please just let me go home.

31:47.294 --> 31:48.807
I'll tell them anything!

31:50.331 --> 31:53.986
Sure kid, we understand...
and we believe her.

31:55.611 --> 31:57.921
As soon as we finish a
little business here,

31:58.124 --> 32:00.603
we'll drop you at the nearest bus.
Okay?

32:01.119 --> 32:03.003
Why don't you clean up
if you want to?

32:03.423 --> 32:04.423
Billie!

32:04.597 --> 32:06.477
Oh, it's wonderful!

32:06.577 --> 32:08.005
Take care of the girl!

32:08.354 --> 32:10.105
Oh, I needed that.

32:20.513 --> 32:22.364
So what happens now, eh?

32:27.062 --> 32:29.060
I think the kid will go along to a point.

32:30.418 --> 32:32.512
We've gotta keep her thinkin'
she's got a chance.

32:32.748 --> 32:35.082
The moment she comes out of
shock, she'll wise up.

32:35.236 --> 32:38.002
So why don't we get the hell out
of here before she does.

32:38.257 --> 32:40.694
Before the old man blows
the whistle, eh?

32:41.379 --> 32:44.481
That old man is a sick character.

32:45.381 --> 32:48.121
He ain't blowing the whistle
on any broad under fifty.

32:48.817 --> 32:51.015
He's got a thing for women.

32:52.481 --> 32:56.153
And here's where our screenplay
starts to unfold right now.

32:56.483 --> 32:58.636
Hey girls, we got company comin'!

32:59.272 --> 33:02.398
Billie! Watch that sweet young thing.

33:04.505 --> 33:06.080
Let's meet the enemy halfway.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.080
The less the girl hears,
the better.

33:14.887 --> 33:17.476
Just cool it, honey.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

33:18.177 --> 33:20.130
As for that lecherous
old creep out there,

33:20.230 --> 33:21.792
he wouldn't help you if he could.

33:21.995 --> 33:23.585
You're safer with us.

33:26.647 --> 33:29.864
Well, I see you've
made yourselves at home.

33:29.964 --> 33:33.143
We used a few gallons of water and
20 square feet of sand.

33:33.475 --> 33:35.220
That isn't exactly living it up.

33:35.423 --> 33:39.485
You girls a bunch of nudists?
Or you just, uh, short of clothes?

33:42.988 --> 33:45.552
Why'd you have
that girl tied n' gagged?

33:45.652 --> 33:47.620
You get around on
those wheels pretty good.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.223
Anybody uses my land and my water,

33:50.969 --> 33:51.822
I'm around.

33:51.922 --> 33:53.396
Nobody's tied now.

33:53.496 --> 33:55.016
You didn't answer my question.

33:56.747 --> 33:57.943
Should I ask the girl?

33:58.321 --> 34:00.986
Her boyfriend was killed in
a racing accident.

34:01.198 --> 34:03.118
She flipped and tried
to kill herself.

34:03.804 --> 34:06.638
Her family's big socially, and
doesn't want any publicity.

34:07.002 --> 34:08.322
We're takin' her home.

34:08.839 --> 34:12.900
Sounds, uh, like a matter
for the police to handle.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.860
Her old man's a politician.
They don't want any publicity.

34:17.004 --> 34:18.867
We're just following their instructions.

34:19.288 --> 34:21.472
Besides, we're all members of
the same car club.

34:21.572 --> 34:23.553
They asked us to bring
her home and,

34:24.010 --> 34:25.567
sort of like friends of the family.

34:25.965 --> 34:28.808
Sort of takin' the long way, aren't ya?

34:28.908 --> 34:30.206
Bringin' her home in the
middle of the night

34:30.306 --> 34:32.076
wouldn't help anybody,
especially her.

34:34.215 --> 34:37.385
My son Kirk's gone
to town for supplies.

34:38.402 --> 34:40.246
Might as well all have
lunch together

34:40.346 --> 34:41.855
before you fix to leave.

34:42.768 --> 34:45.714
I wouldn't want anybody to think
I wasn't hospitable.

34:45.813 --> 34:48.018
Oh, now who would think that?

34:48.659 --> 34:49.926
See you at lunch, sweetheart.

34:50.025 --> 34:53.476
Oh, is it formal, or can we
stay comfortable?

34:55.462 --> 34:57.956
We never was one to stand
on formality.

34:59.376 --> 35:00.376
Let's go boy.

35:09.220 --> 35:13.947
That big phony.
He'd take any story I laid down.

35:14.047 --> 35:17.642
He wants company...
Our kind of company.

35:17.742 --> 35:19.876
I don't trust him.

35:20.756 --> 35:23.844
Just one call and we got
our ticket punched for the joint.

35:23.944 --> 35:26.253
Look around, dummy.
You see any wires?

35:26.710 --> 35:29.046
He told me there's no phone
within five miles.

35:29.194 --> 35:30.596
We lucked out like mad.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.094
Now don't panic and blow it.

35:32.320 --> 35:35.570
Right now we gotta start checkin' the
back roads for a way outta here.

35:35.697 --> 35:39.047
And just maybe we might run
across the old man's stash.

35:39.147 --> 35:42.022
If it ain't in the house,
it's out here somewhere.

35:42.122 --> 35:44.454
And we may just have to
make him tell us.

35:44.554 --> 35:46.314
And I'll take care of that problem.

35:46.469 --> 35:49.736
So who do I get to take care of,
the muscle man?

35:49.836 --> 35:51.314
Rosie and I are gonna take a walk.

35:51.414 --> 35:53.821
As soon as we get back, we're
all havin' lunch at the house.

35:53.948 --> 35:58.061
Crazy. Like what's the old man
plannin' for the main course... us?

35:58.169 --> 36:00.614
Knock it off!
And you watch that girl!

36:00.714 --> 36:03.620
She's liable to go any time.
If she gives you any hint,

36:04.001 --> 36:06.420
you tie her up and gag her again,
you understand?!

36:06.590 --> 36:09.063
Alright already, I'm hip!

36:17.489 --> 36:21.344
Jack and Jill. They make the
mafia look like Brownies.

36:21.444 --> 36:23.445
You really don't like them, do you?

36:23.545 --> 36:26.466
It's kicks, but I'm not under
contract to 'em

36:26.566 --> 36:30.312
and I got a strong feeling option time
is right around the corner.

36:31.238 --> 36:32.588
Don't let it bug ya.

36:32.792 --> 36:36.712
You just be a good kid,
otherwise we're both in big trouble.

36:36.823 --> 36:38.905
What do you think of our guests, boy?

36:39.285 --> 36:40.605
Boy, listen to me!

36:41.595 --> 36:43.472
Fate threw us this package.

36:44.142 --> 36:47.182
Now all we gotta do is untie
them pretty ribbons.

36:47.586 --> 36:50.404
And we know how to do that, don't we boy?

36:51.136 --> 36:54.298
Yeah, all that land to hide them ribbons in
when we're done with 'em.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.400
That young 'un...

36:57.515 --> 36:59.339
Tender as a cottontail.

36:59.541 --> 37:02.451
And we gotta save her from those girls,
boy, you hear me now?

37:02.551 --> 37:03.758
We got to save her!

37:03.858 --> 37:05.021
Save who?

37:06.361 --> 37:10.712
Well... the young ladies.
You're, uh, early.

37:10.812 --> 37:13.859
It's, it's two hours yet 'til feeding time.

37:13.959 --> 37:17.870
We ain't hungry... not food
hungry anyway.

37:18.505 --> 37:20.917
Uh, we're just lookin' around.

37:21.500 --> 37:22.557
Lookin' for what?

37:23.069 --> 37:25.714
Oh you know, checkin' the lay of the land.

37:26.323 --> 37:32.289
He's really fantastic.
Now he just wasn't hatched that way, was he?

37:33.152 --> 37:36.427
He's always been big. Always.

37:37.315 --> 37:39.522
I mean he must work out a lot, huh?

37:39.854 --> 37:44.651
Yeah. Yeah, he does a lot of that.
Show her, son.

37:45.387 --> 37:47.362
Show her how you stay strong.

37:47.621 --> 37:49.195
Maybe some other time.

37:49.295 --> 37:50.997
I gotta stay with her.

37:51.327 --> 37:52.776
But thanks anyway.

37:52.901 --> 37:57.318
Well, I reckon the little lady
and I'll be safe together.

37:57.418 --> 37:59.359
Hey, it ain't all that nervous.

37:59.780 --> 38:02.903
She ain't going nowhere.
Are you, baby?

38:04.274 --> 38:05.648
Then you'll be okay.

38:09.198 --> 38:10.900
So show me already, huh?

38:35.269 --> 38:37.325
C'mon, rest awhile girl.

38:39.965 --> 38:41.335
That's better.

38:41.945 --> 38:44.847
Now we can converse
a mite together...

38:44.947 --> 38:48.131
and you can tell me all
about your friends.

38:48.231 --> 38:51.037
You got yourself quite a
playroom here, buster.

38:51.137 --> 38:53.317
What you need now is a playmate.

38:53.448 --> 38:55.703
I may not be much in the
muscle department,

38:56.096 --> 38:58.673
but I got a few things goin'
for me too, you know.

38:59.714 --> 39:02.151
What you need is a manager.

39:02.432 --> 39:07.659
Yeah. Ten percent of your action
be enough for anyone.

39:07.888 --> 39:12.221
I never took no course in anatomy,
but from what I can see...

39:13.803 --> 39:17.534
you got two of everything,
and some left over.

39:18.626 --> 39:20.316
I don't know what you're trainin' for,

39:20.736 --> 39:24.033
but as far as I'm concerned,
you're ready.

39:25.911 --> 39:30.328
Look! Me Jane, you Tarzan.

39:30.547 --> 39:32.925
Now why don't you drop that
tree you're holding

39:33.025 --> 39:35.430
and let's grab a vine and
swing a little, huh?

39:38.268 --> 39:39.467
What the hell was that?!

39:41.341 --> 39:42.381
Boy!

39:43.097 --> 39:44.206
What happened?

39:45.254 --> 39:47.517
- Where is she?
- Ah, she's gone.

39:53.098 --> 39:57.541
Ah, that little girl is dangerous!
She nearly tried to kill me!

39:57.641 --> 40:00.131
Oh, I'll bet.
She's real dangerous.

40:00.231 --> 40:03.279
You got a shotgun in her belly
and she's dangerous!

40:03.379 --> 40:06.958
C'mon, I gotta find her
or I'm in big trouble! C'mon!

40:07.058 --> 40:09.928
Yeah, you bring her back now, you hear me?
You bring her back!

40:10.106 --> 40:15.538
Yeah. Yeah, we got unfinished business!
Her and me.

40:29.830 --> 40:31.938
Thank you for stopping,
you saved my life!

40:32.038 --> 40:34.729
Take it easy now, girl, easy.
You're gonna be alright.

40:35.925 --> 40:38.233
So who's after you, huh?
The cottontails, maybe?

40:38.333 --> 40:40.712
Or did your boyfriend make
you walk home?

40:40.812 --> 40:44.731
My boyfriend is dead!
He's dead!

40:44.990 --> 40:47.193
Just relax for a minute and
then tell me all about it.

40:47.345 --> 40:50.200
Please just get me out of here.
Help me!

40:50.323 --> 40:51.912
Of course I'll help you.

40:52.012 --> 40:55.212
Now grab a hold of yourself so
I can understand how I can help.

40:55.320 --> 40:58.159
Just get me out of here
before they get me, please!

40:58.453 --> 41:01.028
Look, I don't see anyone,
so relax!

41:01.212 --> 41:03.615
You're safe here, believe me,
I know.

41:03.715 --> 41:05.791
Now what's the matter?
What are you running away from?

41:05.891 --> 41:08.460
Don't you understand?!
They're murderers!

41:08.560 --> 41:11.969
They kidnapped me, and
killed my boyfriend!

41:12.131 --> 41:13.611
They're vicious killers!

41:13.719 --> 41:15.472
Wait a minute! Who are vicious killers?

41:15.599 --> 41:19.153
Those girls! Wild drivers, sports cars!

41:19.253 --> 41:21.082
Well how did these girls kill your friend?

41:21.182 --> 41:24.890
With her bare hands,
she just chopped him down!

41:25.448 --> 41:27.531
And then she grabbed him by his neck!

41:28.131 --> 41:33.063
And then she pulled... the noise it made
...and it snapped!

41:37.353 --> 41:38.435
There, that's right...

41:39.690 --> 41:41.720
Just let it all out and
then we'll see

41:41.820 --> 41:43.598
about getting you
where you want to be.

41:48.326 --> 41:50.706
Where is everyone?!
Billie and the other girl's missing!

41:51.010 --> 41:54.660
The girl escaped... the other one
and my son are looking for her.

41:54.760 --> 41:55.929
She won't get far.

41:56.063 --> 41:58.958
She won't get far?!
What the hell happened?!

41:59.058 --> 42:01.209
She damn near killed me,
that's how!

42:01.309 --> 42:02.561
She's a demon, that one.

42:02.661 --> 42:05.216
She knocked me over!
Me, a cripple.

42:05.316 --> 42:07.409
And what caused that?
Her pushin' you out of your chair.

42:07.509 --> 42:08.832
Nothin' you did of course!

42:08.932 --> 42:10.686
Nothin' gave her no reason.

42:11.538 --> 42:17.031
What could I do?
I am tied to this chair for life!

42:17.131 --> 42:19.086
Better you should be nailed to it!

42:19.529 --> 42:21.068
How long has she been gone?!

42:21.168 --> 42:22.310
How long?!

42:27.133 --> 42:28.707
That's my other son...

42:30.128 --> 42:32.464
He knows this country best.
He can help us.

42:33.172 --> 42:34.926
But I just escaped from here!

42:35.459 --> 42:37.668
Don't you understand?
Those girls, they're in there!

42:37.779 --> 42:39.825
Look... I told you to
just trust me.

42:39.925 --> 42:42.262
I promise you'll be safe,
I promise.

42:46.476 --> 42:47.771
That's them!

42:47.923 --> 42:49.651
Please turn around before they...

42:49.751 --> 42:50.842
- Please!
- Look...

42:50.969 --> 42:52.975
I live here, do you understand?

42:53.075 --> 42:54.574
This is my home.

42:57.163 --> 42:59.192
You... you live here?

43:02.439 --> 43:04.061
And that old man?

43:04.161 --> 43:05.202
Is my father.

43:06.216 --> 43:07.767
You're one of them, let me out!

43:10.240 --> 43:12.648
You're crazy! All of you!

43:13.029 --> 43:15.263
Nice of you to bring her back,
we've been worried.

43:15.491 --> 43:19.070
She's a sick girl. You need rest,
honey, a lot of rest.

43:19.243 --> 43:20.226
Don't you understand?

43:20.326 --> 43:23.766
They'll kill me! I'm alone!
Help! Help!

43:32.935 --> 43:34.910
Do you tell me?
Or do I ask them?

43:35.837 --> 43:37.423
What's to tell, son?

43:37.523 --> 43:39.353
Don't be foolish, old man.

43:39.733 --> 43:42.703
I wanna know what's going on.
Who are they?

43:43.262 --> 43:47.730
Well, it's a simple story...
it ain't an easy one to believe.

43:48.886 --> 43:51.026
But then the truth ain't never easy.

43:55.066 --> 43:58.427
You're wasting yourself on this kid,
then hanging us up for nothing.

43:58.527 --> 43:59.593
For nothin'?!

43:59.693 --> 44:01.392
She's got nothing to do with the money!

44:01.492 --> 44:02.657
She is the money!

44:02.757 --> 44:04.763
Didn't you see the look
on the old man's face?!

44:04.930 --> 44:06.695
And what do you figure
the old man's layin' down

44:06.795 --> 44:08.520
to number one son right now?

44:08.620 --> 44:12.277
It's a political thing...
her folks are nervous about publicity.

44:12.404 --> 44:14.004
They want her back quiet-like.

44:14.684 --> 44:15.974
Now she's going back today,

44:16.074 --> 44:18.928
soon as we give 'em a full
stomach to travel on.

44:19.613 --> 44:21.274
So why don't you and
the Vegetable

44:21.374 --> 44:24.258
fry us up a nice batch of chicken?

44:24.538 --> 44:25.538
Yeah.

44:29.056 --> 44:31.011
Well I guess I better
unload the supplies.

44:31.203 --> 44:32.179
Where's brother?

44:32.279 --> 44:34.158
Lookin' for that girl yet, I reckon.

44:34.258 --> 44:36.519
You know he's not supposed to be alone.

44:36.619 --> 44:38.272
Oh, he ain't alone.

44:38.372 --> 44:40.523
Now you reckon he needs
some chaperonin'?

44:48.810 --> 44:51.223
Hey... It's only a choo choo.

44:51.323 --> 44:52.883
Don't lose the beat, hon.

44:55.902 --> 44:59.243
C'mon, don't like it drive you
off the track, Atlas.

44:59.403 --> 45:01.853
We aren't even halfway home yet.

45:06.575 --> 45:08.582
What ya got, some big
thing for trains?

45:08.682 --> 45:10.256
I'll buy you one.

45:10.504 --> 45:13.759
C'mon, we've got our own
schedule to meet.

45:14.353 --> 45:17.008
It's a b..b..bad thing!

45:17.699 --> 45:20.409
You really are afraid, aren't you?

45:21.526 --> 45:25.156
They make him..him angry.
He gets crazy when they go by.

45:25.256 --> 45:28.128
Oh, your old man,
he's nuts anyway.

45:28.228 --> 45:30.310
Why should a train flip him out?

45:30.600 --> 45:32.086
There are... reasons.

45:34.128 --> 45:35.412
I gotta go!

45:36.778 --> 45:38.571
You better straighten
your tie, Samson!

45:38.671 --> 45:40.819
Or poppa'll spank you!

45:41.211 --> 45:44.398
You thought you done good,
she'll get us all killed.

45:45.341 --> 45:46.441
Did you hear me?!

45:46.541 --> 45:48.463
Yeah, but you aren't sayin' anything!

45:48.563 --> 45:50.592
And you're not doin' anything!

45:50.692 --> 45:54.654
The water's great! You oughtta
try it, it might clear your head.

46:04.579 --> 46:06.661
She's gagged, but that
don't mean she's deaf.

46:06.839 --> 46:09.109
We're gonna dump her, but it's
gotta be miles from here...

46:09.209 --> 46:10.820
one stiff is enough in this area.

46:10.920 --> 46:11.920
When, eh?

46:12.020 --> 46:13.567
I want a crack at Kirk first.

46:13.667 --> 46:16.230
He's no idiot, he should know
where the bread is.

46:16.662 --> 46:18.288
We'll be in the house
having lunch,

46:18.388 --> 46:19.835
but we won't all be eating.

46:21.801 --> 46:24.785
- You were a long time coming!
- You're telling me.

46:24.885 --> 46:26.208
Did you have fun?

46:26.308 --> 46:29.229
Or did you wear yourself out
looking for our girl

46:29.329 --> 46:32.629
Both. Where did you find her?

46:32.729 --> 46:33.585
We didn't.

46:33.685 --> 46:36.183
The old man's son ran across
her driving into the ranch.

46:36.440 --> 46:39.331
One more slider, flake, and it's wipeout!

46:40.168 --> 46:42.455
- What's next on the agenda?
- Lunch!

46:42.555 --> 46:43.951
Plus I'm gonna work on Kirk!

46:44.109 --> 46:45.524
Well what're you gonna do with her?

46:45.624 --> 46:48.520
Take her with us!
She can keep the old man occupied.

46:48.662 --> 46:50.297
The sacrificial lamb...

46:51.837 --> 46:54.739
You really do have the hots
for the long green.

47:05.858 --> 47:07.819
It's a little early for that, isn't it?

47:13.232 --> 47:14.463
The train's late.

47:14.692 --> 47:16.189
What's that got to do with it?

47:16.748 --> 47:18.812
Nothin's on schedule today!

47:25.429 --> 47:27.744
Some..some things never change!

47:36.040 --> 47:40.051
Sound your warnin'.
Send your message.

47:41.143 --> 47:45.661
Huff and puff and belch
your smoke... and kill!

47:45.864 --> 47:49.367
And maim!
And run off unpunished.

47:52.185 --> 47:53.360
Who you talkin' to?

47:53.784 --> 47:54.784
Ghosts!

47:57.084 --> 48:01.218
50 ton highballin' ghosts.

48:05.588 --> 48:07.771
And runnin' late as usual.

48:10.319 --> 48:11.452
I though it was brother.

48:12.264 --> 48:15.869
Brother...
Brother to what?

48:17.291 --> 48:21.098
You proud to have that animal for kin?

48:21.946 --> 48:24.703
What he is now, you manufactured.

48:24.906 --> 48:26.835
What he could be is your son.

48:26.935 --> 48:31.633
Yeah, he's my seedlin'... I can't deny that.

48:32.374 --> 48:34.476
But he ain't no son to me.

48:35.034 --> 48:39.020
He's a... a piece of mutton,
a blob of flesh.

48:39.233 --> 48:40.670
He's no use to no one!

48:40.770 --> 48:42.015
Well you seem to find him useful.

48:42.115 --> 48:43.643
Hell, he's an instrument,
he's a means!

48:43.743 --> 48:45.883
He's for usin' in things that
humans can't do...

48:45.983 --> 48:46.733
Or won't do!

48:46.833 --> 48:48.818
Alright, have it any way
you want!

48:49.788 --> 48:53.616
I'm not for talkin' anymore.
I'm for eatin'.

48:53.751 --> 48:55.715
Well if you don't see it, we ain't got it.

48:55.816 --> 48:57.963
Everything we're gonna be
eatin' is on this table.

48:58.063 --> 49:00.241
When it's gone we're done feedin'.

49:00.341 --> 49:01.326
- Pass the chicken.
- Alright son.

49:01.426 --> 49:03.633
Start passin' that chicken
'fore it loses its juice!

49:03.733 --> 49:06.537
What you got, another shift
comin' on when we're done?

49:07.756 --> 49:09.486
Breast or thigh, darlin'?

49:09.586 --> 49:11.213
Why don't you take
on of each, son?

49:11.313 --> 49:13.518
They, uh, both look tender.

49:14.026 --> 49:17.348
Forget about the other shift,
I didn't know about Goliath here.

49:17.503 --> 49:20.195
Oh, he's got a big motor to feed!

49:21.143 --> 49:25.014
You done real good, son.
He cooks better than his ma!

49:25.114 --> 49:29.256
- He doesn't sew too, does he?
- Only his wild oats, honey!

49:32.575 --> 49:34.581
Hey, you better eat somethin'...

49:34.681 --> 49:38.369
all that runnin' you did this mornin'
must of made you weak.

49:39.080 --> 49:41.670
And you might, uh, wanna run again.

49:43.279 --> 49:45.914
She's had her exercise for today.

49:47.117 --> 49:50.537
Nice of you to pick her up for us.
Her parents will be grateful.

49:51.556 --> 49:52.889
Oh, it was a lucky accident.

49:54.132 --> 49:56.921
I guess it was lucky...
she doesn't seem to think so.

49:57.021 --> 49:58.601
She's not really thinking...

49:59.490 --> 50:01.317
but once she's home
she'll come around.

50:01.930 --> 50:04.643
Doesn't seem to pleased
about going home...

50:04.911 --> 50:06.122
if that's where she's going.

50:06.222 --> 50:09.669
Oh, she's the quiet type,
you know how they are.

50:09.847 --> 50:11.598
You're kinda that type yourself.

50:12.360 --> 50:16.339
Quiet types interest me.
Are you really that quiet?

50:17.868 --> 50:19.016
Only when I'm eating.

50:19.116 --> 50:21.194
I like men with big appetites...

50:21.294 --> 50:23.921
Only I could never find one
to match mine.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.149
Uh honey, you uh...

50:25.433 --> 50:28.377
what you eat seems to settle
in the right places.

50:29.418 --> 50:30.578
But then, uh...

50:32.464 --> 50:35.739
You look to me like a gal with
a big appetite for everything.

50:36.044 --> 50:38.201
I try to think big.

50:39.833 --> 50:46.124
Mister host... I'm of legal age for
whiskey, votin', and lovin'.

50:46.439 --> 50:48.662
Now the next election's
two years away,

50:48.762 --> 50:51.048
and my love life ain't
gettin' much better,

50:51.148 --> 50:53.809
so how 'bout some of that
good one hundred percent?

50:53.909 --> 50:55.615
I'm glad for the company.

50:56.179 --> 50:58.230
Good whiskey's meant
to be shared.

50:58.668 --> 51:00.007
What'll we drink to?

51:00.464 --> 51:02.724
Oh, let's drink to trains.

51:02.824 --> 51:08.282
They're big, fast, and strong.
And they make a lot of noise.

51:10.707 --> 51:12.928
That's a mighty strange kind of toast.

51:13.028 --> 51:14.806
She's a strange girl, pop.

51:15.822 --> 51:21.127
I've got a toast...
let's drink to, uh, making new friends.

51:21.584 --> 51:23.107
Crazy, Varla.

51:23.207 --> 51:25.772
I'd rather make 'em than
kill 'em any day.

51:26.077 --> 51:28.877
Old show biz saying... you know,
when you got 'em in Frisco,

51:28.977 --> 51:30.477
it don't mean you got 'em
in Debuque.

51:30.577 --> 51:31.761
Could I have some more food?

51:31.941 --> 51:33.946
He must keep you on overtime.

51:34.770 --> 51:36.916
Well he works hard, he eats big.

51:40.013 --> 51:42.628
You haven't touched a thing.
Is something wrong?

51:43.750 --> 51:49.406
She's, uh, in great shock.
She's had a terrible experience.

51:50.878 --> 51:53.086
Uh, it's an interesting case.

51:57.366 --> 51:59.813
I'd appreciate your advice before we leave.

52:00.321 --> 52:03.190
Oh, well I'm no psychiatrist...

52:04.506 --> 52:06.896
She looks to me like she
needs professional help.

52:06.996 --> 52:08.405
I think he's right...

52:08.698 --> 52:10.931
and we should get her home
where she can get it.

52:11.031 --> 52:13.775
Her parents will certainly be
looking for her by now.

52:14.003 --> 52:18.342
They know she's safe.
I'm sure they're not too worried.

52:18.442 --> 52:21.295
Probably not, hon, but somebody
else's folks will be...

52:21.395 --> 52:23.523
all that sand to brush off.

52:26.725 --> 52:29.045
Don't! Oh, God, don't!

52:29.145 --> 52:32.798
She'll kill you! She'll kill you!
She killed him! She will!

52:32.898 --> 52:34.793
You're listening to a sick girl!

52:35.304 --> 52:38.235
She's lost her fiancÃ©,
she's a long way from home.

52:38.335 --> 52:40.294
She lies. She killed!

52:40.394 --> 52:43.171
She killed with her
bare hands! She did!

52:43.627 --> 52:46.369
Oh, she did! She did!

52:49.482 --> 52:52.077
Oh, she did, she did!

53:01.817 --> 53:04.494
This house knows what
killin' can do.

53:04.743 --> 53:07.464
And how easy it can happen
accidentally.

53:09.586 --> 53:14.394
He killed when he was born...
without knowin' it.

53:16.871 --> 53:18.989
You see he was big then,
even then...

53:19.203 --> 53:22.999
and he killed his mother,
and he doesn't even know it.

53:25.182 --> 53:27.340
And I can't tell him or explain it.

53:30.364 --> 53:34.222
I just hate him... and he's my blood.

53:36.310 --> 53:37.413
My son.

53:52.039 --> 53:54.375
Brother, take him to his room.

54:05.240 --> 54:08.086
Well, I think lunch is over.

54:08.256 --> 54:11.332
I want to talk to you.
It's important.

54:11.890 --> 54:14.429
Let's try some of that
clean desert air.

54:20.064 --> 54:21.130
Excuse me.

54:24.329 --> 54:26.497
That was a short lunch.

54:26.597 --> 54:29.025
Whaddya tryin' to do, make it a short day?

54:29.420 --> 54:32.073
Leave the juice alone,
we got a lot to do yet.

54:32.173 --> 54:34.331
Look at you, you're
already stone.

54:35.727 --> 54:39.976
Yeah, that's right...
I'm drunk.

54:41.004 --> 54:45.703
And it feels good, Rosie.
That's why I do things...

54:46.541 --> 54:52.498
to feel good. I can turn myself
on a dozen different ways.

54:53.141 --> 54:57.448
But you?
You've only got one channel.

54:58.899 --> 55:02.301
And your channel's busy tunin' in outside.

55:03.125 --> 55:05.757
You really should
be AM and FM...

55:07.052 --> 55:09.581
you one-band broads
are a drag.

55:09.681 --> 55:12.511
You're a fool, you're bagged-out with sauce.

55:14.616 --> 55:17.535
But I always leave myself a choice.

55:19.109 --> 55:21.292
Oh, I've made some
bad picks,

55:22.105 --> 55:24.719
but that could even happen
with the horses.

55:26.166 --> 55:29.884
Nobody owns me... yet.

55:29.984 --> 55:32.514
If the money's here,
the son knows.

55:32.614 --> 55:35.381
And if he knows,
Varla will know soon.

55:36.574 --> 55:37.665
Whoops.

55:38.353 --> 55:42.920
Oh, she'll know somethin', son.
That's for sure.

55:44.025 --> 55:47.515
You watch the girl.
I'm getting our things ready to move.

55:47.997 --> 55:53.133
Ya know, Tiny Tim?
When I've had enough of this stuff,

55:54.217 --> 55:57.564
it's been known to be passin' out time...

55:59.250 --> 56:02.594
and it's just about passin' out time!

56:14.245 --> 56:16.098
I knew you were more than you looked.

56:17.824 --> 56:21.430
And you... I didn't think that you could...

56:22.343 --> 56:24.137
Why do you stay here?

56:30.187 --> 56:31.391
It's home...

56:32.903 --> 56:37.785
My father likes it here.
This is where he wants to die.

56:39.097 --> 56:42.295
Will he ever?
He seems indestructible.

56:45.875 --> 56:47.067
You hate him...

56:51.084 --> 56:52.952
But you're like him in most ways.

56:55.343 --> 56:59.125
If you believe that,
how could you be with me like this?

57:00.556 --> 57:04.405
'Cause you're a beautiful animal...
and I'm weak.

57:06.151 --> 57:07.477
And I want you.

57:18.646 --> 57:20.322
Badly I want you.

57:23.561 --> 57:25.245
What's weak about wanting?

57:26.383 --> 57:30.145
Everybody wants...
that's what makes things run.

57:31.186 --> 57:34.712
Your father, he wants revenge.
You want me.

57:34.812 --> 57:37.718
And you... what do you want?

57:38.798 --> 57:42.367
Everything... Or as much as I can get.

57:47.698 --> 57:52.191
Right now you're first on my list...
and I always start at the top.

58:09.920 --> 58:11.421
You did want.

58:12.434 --> 58:14.166
You wanted big...

58:15.380 --> 58:17.013
real big.

58:19.464 --> 58:21.452
Oh, you're unbelievable, you're...

58:22.562 --> 58:26.666
Whatever you want. Your cup to fill.

58:27.769 --> 58:29.379
To overflow.

58:33.522 --> 58:37.567
So much of you...
so damn awful much.

58:39.668 --> 58:45.843
Don't talk it, do it.
Just do it.

58:49.427 --> 58:51.121
Where are you going?
What's your hurry?

58:51.221 --> 58:53.915
The girl's gone.
Your friend passed out in there.

58:54.018 --> 58:54.889
But how could...

58:54.989 --> 58:57.241
How ain't important,
but catchin' her is!

58:57.384 --> 58:59.170
Move it, boy!

59:17.860 --> 59:20.163
Seems like an awful lot
of action around here.

59:21.197 --> 59:22.888
Sounds like my motor
being revved up...

59:22.988 --> 59:24.732
which makes twice today.

59:32.246 --> 59:33.358
Somethin' wrong
with your car?

59:33.458 --> 59:35.214
It's not as fast, and
we need speed!

59:35.314 --> 59:36.286
What's your hurry?

59:36.386 --> 59:38.958
Your little playmate's gone,
and I suggest we do the same.

59:39.058 --> 59:39.931
How long?

59:40.031 --> 59:42.654
I don't know, the old man and the
kid are already looking for her.

59:42.788 --> 59:43.981
Billie's passed out.

59:44.081 --> 59:45.473
Passed out?!

59:45.573 --> 59:47.579
Get her sobered up and ready to go!

59:47.737 --> 59:48.906
What're you gonna do?

59:49.234 --> 59:52.046
C'mon Kirk, we gotta find her
before the old lech does.

59:54.322 --> 59:55.940
Oh, you know about that too, huh?

01:00:12.507 --> 01:00:15.300
Old man, I hope you
get there first.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.837
You'll save us a lot of
grief if you do.

01:00:18.253 --> 01:00:19.538
Keep watchin'.

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:23.131
She's on foot, she can't be far.

01:00:23.701 --> 01:00:26.367
We don't wanna miss her, boy,
we wanna get there first.

01:00:26.976 --> 01:00:30.301
Oh, I tell you, boy,
she's so like the one I...

01:00:30.428 --> 01:00:32.096
saved that day I got hurt,

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:34.490
I thought it was a ghost
when I first seen her!

01:00:35.021 --> 01:00:38.107
She's just as pretty, boy,
only I ain't savin' this one.

01:00:42.917 --> 01:00:46.074
She should be easy to spot,
it's awful bare country around here.

01:00:46.174 --> 01:00:48.638
Not necessarily, this country
plays tricks with the eyes.

01:00:48.738 --> 01:00:50.325
I hope it dulls your old man.

01:00:50.425 --> 01:00:53.579
What's with him?
The revenge bit, the hatred for women?

01:00:54.113 --> 01:00:56.600
Young girl was trying to make the
platform of a moving train.

01:00:56.793 --> 01:00:57.793
She was late.

01:00:58.207 --> 01:01:00.636
My father tried to help her.
They both fell.

01:01:00.864 --> 01:01:05.307
Did something to his spine.
The girl caught the next train.

01:01:10.387 --> 01:01:12.592
That's her! That's her.

01:01:13.476 --> 01:01:17.884
Yeah, I knew if we kept our eyes
peeled we'd spot her.

01:01:17.984 --> 01:01:20.792
C'mon boy, let's get her,
don't let her get away this time.

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:24.549
C'mon boy, you know
what to do now.

01:01:24.904 --> 01:01:26.655
Just like before!

01:01:27.173 --> 01:01:29.194
That's it boy, we got her now.

01:01:29.702 --> 01:01:32.519
Go on boy, get her! Get her good!

01:01:34.405 --> 01:01:35.844
That's it, boy! Get her!

01:01:37.544 --> 01:01:38.916
Cover up her mouth!

01:01:39.942 --> 01:01:43.136
Are you with me, boy?
Your daddy tells you!

01:01:45.262 --> 01:01:49.426
Go on boy! Don't let her
scream again, cover her mouth!

01:01:49.654 --> 01:01:50.892
You hear me boy?

01:01:51.101 --> 01:01:55.264
It's your daddy tellin' ya,
your daddy in pain, boy!

01:01:58.945 --> 01:02:00.831
Boy! Go on!

01:02:04.022 --> 01:02:05.886
There they are, they must have found her!

01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:07.708
I wonder how we'll find her.

01:02:08.528 --> 01:02:09.937
Don't tell me you're worried...

01:02:10.502 --> 01:02:12.712
Why do you stay with a freak like that
when you know what he is?

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.101
Everyone has problems.

01:02:14.201 --> 01:02:16.337
My brother means a good deal
to me, he can be helped.

01:02:16.437 --> 01:02:18.466
Not as long's your old man's alive.

01:02:18.654 --> 01:02:20.400
- Now there's a thought...
- What?

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.894
Hey, like he's sitting on
some bread.

01:02:21.994 --> 01:02:23.213
You know, money?

01:02:23.313 --> 01:02:25.202
He's of no use to no one,
including himself.

01:02:25.302 --> 01:02:26.614
So? So what?

01:02:27.436 --> 01:02:28.403
So look out there!

01:02:28.503 --> 01:02:31.167
That's what you're living with,
a couple of real Boy Scouts!

01:02:31.267 --> 01:02:35.067
Go ahead, I don't care!
Go ahead, get it over with!

01:02:35.299 --> 01:02:39.900
Just leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

01:02:42.402 --> 01:02:43.597
Brother!

01:02:49.258 --> 01:02:52.722
Pa... Pa... I can't do it...

01:02:58.193 --> 01:03:01.251
I'm... I no m... mean to.

01:03:02.483 --> 01:03:06.189
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:03:14.202 --> 01:03:17.485
Easy, brother. Easy now,
everything's gonna be alright.

01:03:17.773 --> 01:03:19.567
You're doin' fine, you're doin' just fine.

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:23.222
I'm... s... sorry.

01:03:24.035 --> 01:03:27.309
You... believe me?

01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:31.610
I...

01:03:32.846 --> 01:03:35.838
I... don't know.

01:03:37.445 --> 01:03:39.596
Nothing's... right.

01:03:41.697 --> 01:03:44.038
Nothing's... ever right.

01:03:44.749 --> 01:03:45.891
You're gonna be alright.

01:03:47.287 --> 01:03:48.886
Everybody's sorry...

01:03:49.851 --> 01:03:52.948
I've made some funny scenes
before, but this cops it.

01:03:53.099 --> 01:03:55.588
You got to win it, the big award!

01:03:56.045 --> 01:03:59.243
What's it called, Gulliver?
"I love everybody?"

01:03:59.343 --> 01:04:01.706
Or "something from my childhood?"

01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:07.050
Are you nuts?!
Protecting two kooks?!

01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:09.150
They tried to rape this girl!
Do you hear me?!

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:12.644
I can't help but hear you!
It's over now, nobody's hurt!

01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:15.616
You alright?

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:21.429
After I take her home,
I'll tend to my problems.

01:04:21.836 --> 01:04:23.536
He'll have to be committed...

01:04:24.106 --> 01:04:26.811
He can be a person yet, it'll take time.

01:04:28.207 --> 01:04:32.015
Too much time! We could have made it.

01:04:32.167 --> 01:04:33.464
I don't think so.

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:36.272
Come on, Linda.

01:04:47.626 --> 01:04:49.734
It ain't all that easy, son...

01:04:50.657 --> 01:04:53.627
You're gonna have to walk a bit,
where you're goin'.

01:04:54.379 --> 01:04:56.148
I mean you're gonna
find it kind of hard

01:04:56.248 --> 01:04:58.313
to drive without any keys.

01:05:05.091 --> 01:05:06.558
Where's the keys, old man?

01:05:08.061 --> 01:05:10.118
Old man, give me the keys!

01:05:11.006 --> 01:05:12.478
I threw them away.

01:05:15.433 --> 01:05:18.725
You fool! You miserable fool.

01:05:19.256 --> 01:05:22.296
You'd destroy us all to
satisfy your hunger for revenge.

01:05:23.064 --> 01:05:25.657
Well I've had enough of your self-pity.

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:29.389
You can rot for all I care.

01:05:35.088 --> 01:05:38.161
C'mon, Linda. We're gonna walk.

01:05:44.202 --> 01:05:45.558
Wait a minute, hero.

01:05:45.658 --> 01:05:47.476
I don't care if you wanna walk
yourself into a sweat

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:49.532
in the desert, but what
about the frail?

01:05:49.743 --> 01:05:52.892
C'mon, use your noodle.
I'll drive you both back.

01:05:53.043 --> 01:05:54.465
You must be beat, honey.

01:05:54.897 --> 01:05:56.472
Don't you touch me!

01:05:56.572 --> 01:06:01.598
I don't care how long or far it takes,
I'd rather crawl than...

01:06:02.378 --> 01:06:03.629
Please, let's go.

01:06:03.772 --> 01:06:05.326
C'mon, pop,
I'll give you a lift.

01:06:05.426 --> 01:06:08.222
You too, buster, no sense
in us all goin' noble.

01:06:08.322 --> 01:06:09.636
That is unless you've
got somethin' else

01:06:09.736 --> 01:06:12.209
in mind besides walkin', stud!

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:14.120
You're a very sick girl.

01:06:14.226 --> 01:06:16.297
I was healthy enough
a half hour ago...

01:06:16.397 --> 01:06:19.393
or do people look different to you
when they're not horizontal?

01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:24.292
It's an awful big desert!

01:06:26.603 --> 01:06:28.100
What's he tryin' to prove?

01:06:29.741 --> 01:06:32.466
Maybe that everybody
in this world ain't as...

01:06:33.144 --> 01:06:34.904
twisted up as we are?

01:06:35.004 --> 01:06:36.275
You comin' or not?

01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:39.853
No... I'll take the scenic
route by foot.

01:06:40.284 --> 01:06:43.504
My son here needs the exercise,
but thanks for offerin'.

01:06:43.863 --> 01:06:48.662
You're a real bunch of kooks.
I'll see you again, old man.

01:06:49.168 --> 01:06:51.860
Yeah, in hell you'll see me...

01:06:52.544 --> 01:06:54.652
and we're both better than
even money to make it!

01:06:57.927 --> 01:07:00.024
Alright, c'mon son, let's get movin'.

01:07:00.124 --> 01:07:03.181
I don't aim to have that threesome
prowlin' my property no longer.

01:07:17.327 --> 01:07:18.739
Alright, here's how it works...

01:07:18.839 --> 01:07:19.933
Everybody's gotta go.

01:07:20.033 --> 01:07:22.947
This way we're all safe and we
can all go back to our gigs.

01:07:23.047 --> 01:07:25.342
This'll be just another
deserted ranch house.

01:07:25.442 --> 01:07:28.322
Deserted?!
With all these stiffs layin' around?

01:07:28.422 --> 01:07:29.988
You must be kiddin'.

01:07:30.191 --> 01:07:31.968
Kill four people for what?!

01:07:32.068 --> 01:07:34.672
For mister big pill
they give you in the state.

01:07:34.772 --> 01:07:37.042
I'll take my chances
with the gas.

01:07:37.142 --> 01:07:38.742
I ain't sleeping good as it is,

01:07:38.862 --> 01:07:41.335
and a girl's gotta have that
good eight hours.

01:07:41.485 --> 01:07:43.365
You'd rather have a permanent rest, then?

01:07:43.465 --> 01:07:46.132
Not really, but I'll take the gamble.

01:07:46.232 --> 01:07:49.331
Who knows? I might get a judge
with a thing for blondes.

01:07:49.431 --> 01:07:52.859
Get out then. Get your car and split!

01:07:53.218 --> 01:07:55.931
Well, I hate to break up
the act, girls,

01:07:56.083 --> 01:07:58.216
but I always did wanna
do a single.

01:07:58.672 --> 01:07:59.942
See you in church, huh?

01:08:02.658 --> 01:08:03.778
Let's have it.

01:08:05.653 --> 01:08:06.930
Give it to me!

01:08:16.424 --> 01:08:17.750
Much later, Billie!

01:08:23.069 --> 01:08:26.443
Let her be. Looks like act two's arriving.

01:08:26.542 --> 01:08:27.787
What now?

01:08:27.888 --> 01:08:31.571
Just like we planned...
only there's just the two of us.

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:37.866
Alright, you gals had better make tracks.

01:08:37.966 --> 01:08:39.957
We can tell when we're not wanted.

01:08:40.413 --> 01:08:41.834
You drive, and don't miss.

01:08:41.934 --> 01:08:45.162
Besides, this desert climate's not
too good on a girl's complexion.

01:08:49.385 --> 01:08:50.803
What do you mean?

01:08:51.444 --> 01:08:54.011
I mean nail the old crud
right where he sits.

01:08:54.111 --> 01:08:55.282
Are you out of your skull?

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:57.438
You wanna get the same as Billie?
Move!

01:09:04.825 --> 01:09:06.660
Alright, boy, get me that shotgun.

01:09:08.741 --> 01:09:11.279
Boy, you in a trance?
Get me that shotgun!

01:09:32.658 --> 01:09:36.225
She weren't a bad little blossom,
kinda full of life.

01:09:36.581 --> 01:09:38.296
Treat her gently, son.

01:09:39.424 --> 01:09:40.721
Put her in the house.

01:09:45.993 --> 01:09:49.247
And you!
You better be movin' fast.

01:09:49.348 --> 01:09:52.549
'Cause I'm gonna be notifyin'
the Sheriff real soon.

01:11:05.587 --> 01:11:08.170
So that's where the
old raunch kept his stash!

01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.354
Get the knife while I collect the scratch!

01:11:10.454 --> 01:11:11.454
What about him?!

01:11:11.554 --> 01:11:14.618
Don't sweat it!
Just get the knife and follow my dust!

01:11:17.334 --> 01:11:19.517
Go on! Go back and get the knife!

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:40.053
Don't you think we should
take that knife out of her?

01:11:45.308 --> 01:11:50.213
Ya... you... want... the knife?

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:58.330
Sh..she... doesn't...

01:11:59.752 --> 01:12:04.080
move... or laugh... anymore.

01:12:05.846 --> 01:12:08.735
Yeah, too bad.

01:12:10.015 --> 01:12:11.182
The knife.

01:12:12.835 --> 01:12:16.709
Is... the knife... yours?

01:12:16.809 --> 01:12:20.899
Oh, no no... but we
should pull it out.

01:12:20.999 --> 01:12:22.954
It's not right to leave
it in there.

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:59.647
I'll... give... you the knife.

01:13:22.811 --> 01:13:24.004
The knife...

01:13:26.745 --> 01:13:30.646
Is..is yours... to... keep now.

01:13:42.078 --> 01:13:43.626
Rosie!

01:16:09.436 --> 01:16:11.822
That's two out of three falls.

01:16:32.102 --> 01:16:33.476
That's our truck.

01:16:34.288 --> 01:16:36.128
My brother must've found the keys.

01:16:37.016 --> 01:16:38.426
What does he want?

01:16:38.806 --> 01:16:40.674
Relax, he'll give us a lift.

01:16:43.525 --> 01:16:46.624
That's strange,
my brother can't drive like that.

01:16:50.889 --> 01:16:52.100
It's her!

01:16:52.819 --> 01:16:54.799
We've really gotta make
tracks or we're dead!

01:16:55.017 --> 01:16:56.017
C'mon!

01:18:49.563 --> 01:18:52.610
Your old man's been
blasted out of his wheels.

01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:56.392
And your king-sized brother's
been twisted like a pretzel.

01:18:56.862 --> 01:18:58.347
You're all that's left, lover,

01:18:58.515 --> 01:19:00.571
and you ain't gonna be
around for long.

01:19:00.671 --> 01:19:01.878
I don't believe it!

01:19:01.978 --> 01:19:04.614
You'd better believe it.
Ha!

01:19:25.629 --> 01:19:26.638
She'll get you!

01:19:26.738 --> 01:19:27.810
Ha!

01:19:41.524 --> 01:19:42.659
No!

01:19:44.268 --> 01:19:45.390
Ha!

01:19:50.614 --> 01:19:51.722
Watch out!

01:20:34.504 --> 01:20:35.624
Ha!

01:21:23.522 --> 01:21:26.151
Easy. Easy now, it's okay.

01:21:28.598 --> 01:21:33.194
I killed her! I killed her like
she was an animal.

01:21:33.625 --> 01:21:35.504
Like she was nothing!

01:21:40.174 --> 01:21:43.525
She was nothing... nothing human.

01:21:44.515 --> 01:21:45.962
A real Jekyll and Hyde.

01:21:46.749 --> 01:21:49.008
Hey you saved my life,
so stop crying, huh?

01:21:49.872 --> 01:21:55.232
Me to... I guess I saved my own.

01:21:57.741 --> 01:22:00.185
C'mon. Let's go.

01:22:02.805 --> 01:22:04.870
Are you gonna just leave her there?

01:22:07.123 --> 01:22:08.809
Well, she's not goin' anywhere.

01:22:09.305 --> 01:22:15.579
