00:00.125 --> 00:02.500
(Oliver) Previously on Mighty Med...

00:02.583 --> 00:04.959
It's all the superheroes' powers
the Annihilator has stolen.

00:05.041 --> 00:06.375
What are you doing here?

00:07.417 --> 00:09.000
He's absorbing the power!

00:09.083 --> 00:10.542
Tell us where Mighty Med is.

00:10.625 --> 00:13.291
Wallace and Clyde were Catastrophe?

00:13.375 --> 00:15.166
It's time to make the supernova.

00:17.208 --> 00:19.125
(Oliver) I promised you
the first day I met you

00:19.208 --> 00:21.125
that I'd get your powers back.

00:21.208 --> 00:22.583
I need to run some tests on you.

00:22.667 --> 00:24.458
You tampered with her powers?

00:24.542 --> 00:26.417
She's evil and under my command.

00:26.500 --> 00:30.417
There is a storm coming--
Skylar Storm.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.041
Time to get rid of these
Normos once and for all.

00:36.834 --> 00:37.792
Skylar, stop!

00:37.875 --> 00:41.166
Look, I know deep down
you don't want to do this.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.792
I mean, you and I are BFFs,

00:43.875 --> 00:46.583
we watch movies together,
we help each other with our homework.

00:46.667 --> 00:49.458
And I listen from the other
room and copy your answers.

00:50.875 --> 00:55.083
Sorry, but now the Annihilator
and I are BEFFs--

00:55.166 --> 00:57.208
Best Evil Friends Forever.

01:01.417 --> 01:03.375
Yes, and once we eliminate you two,

01:03.458 --> 01:05.875
we'll turn the rest
of the superheroes evil

01:05.959 --> 01:09.000
and make the world suffer
just as it made me suffer!

01:09.083 --> 01:10.583
There's no way
that plan will ever work.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.417
Actually, it would be pretty easy.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.542
If they locate all the
superheroes' secret files here,

01:14.625 --> 01:16.291
they'd have access
to their hideouts,

01:16.375 --> 01:18.250
their alter egos
and all their weaknesses.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.375
Even better than what I had in mind.

01:20.458 --> 01:22.583
Good plan, Kaz. Thanks.

01:22.667 --> 01:25.625
Kaz, could you please maybe
not help the villains out?

01:26.583 --> 01:29.083
I don't know what's wrong.
Usually I'm no help at all.

Now where are the superhero files?

02:19.834 --> 02:21.250
We don't know.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.667
It's all my fault Skylar's evil.

02:24.750 --> 02:27.083
I should have guessed
the Annihilator would taint her powers.

02:27.166 --> 02:30.166
-Why didn't I test them first?
-You shouldn't blame yourself.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.709
Let me blame you.
This is all your fault!

02:34.083 --> 02:37.917
It is. I wish I could go back in time
and do everything differently.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.834
-Like the superhero Rewind.
-Nuh-uh.

02:40.917 --> 02:43.333
Rewind can only travel
5 seconds into the past.

02:43.417 --> 02:45.834
Uh-huh. In Issue 72, Rewind
discovered that if his powers

02:45.917 --> 02:48.083
were amplified with electrical force,

02:48.166 --> 02:50.458
he could travel back to whatever
time he was thinking about.

02:50.542 --> 02:53.792
-Nuh-uh. It was in Issue 73--
-Quiet!

02:53.875 --> 02:55.333
Are they always like this?

02:55.417 --> 02:56.959
Are you kidding? This is nothing.

02:57.709 --> 03:01.041
Well, shut them up --permanently!

03:03.875 --> 03:05.208
Boys, watch out!

03:10.417 --> 03:12.792
My power is weakened.
It didn't freeze her.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.083
It only slowed her down.

03:22.125 --> 03:24.583
Oh, right, he can do that.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.333
Boys, get help!

03:28.583 --> 03:31.583
And shut those doors!
Were you raised in a barn?

03:35.667 --> 03:36.959
Alan, what are you doing?

03:37.041 --> 03:39.250
I'm running as fast as I can.

03:39.333 --> 03:41.500
Why did I have to morph into a snail?

03:42.375 --> 03:44.208
Alan, you're not a snail anymore.

03:46.417 --> 03:48.375
That would explain the trail of slime.

03:48.458 --> 03:51.125
Yeah, slime, that's what that is.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.417
Alan, look we need to
get to the escape pod.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.166
Great idea! It's right over here.

03:59.542 --> 04:01.333
(beeping)

04:04.709 --> 04:07.208
I forgot-- it'll only fit one person.

04:07.291 --> 04:08.709
How do we decide who goes?

04:08.792 --> 04:13.375
-Uh, we can play rock-paper-scissors.
-Or rock-paper-suckers.

04:13.458 --> 04:15.417
-How do you play that?
-Like this.

04:17.667 --> 04:20.291
I win, suckers!

04:24.083 --> 04:24.917
Wallace?

04:25.667 --> 04:26.750
Clyde?

04:26.834 --> 04:28.291
Yoo-hoo!

04:28.375 --> 04:30.208
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

04:35.625 --> 04:37.083
They must not be here.

04:37.166 --> 04:39.041
I just broke every rule in the store.

04:41.375 --> 04:44.041
-Hey, Jordan.
-Where are Wallace and Clyde?

04:47.041 --> 04:49.625
Irish dancing won't work.
I already tried that.

04:50.959 --> 04:53.000
Then I don't know where they are.

04:53.083 --> 04:54.542
And where is that kid Alan?

04:54.625 --> 04:56.834
He left his rope. He loved that thing.

04:56.917 --> 04:59.375
He had it wrapped around
himself like a big hug.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.917
We need to stay here
and run the store

05:02.000 --> 05:04.083
until Wallace and Clyde get back.

05:04.166 --> 05:06.834
So until then, I'm in charge
and you work for me.

05:06.917 --> 05:08.625
Why do you get to be in charge?

05:08.709 --> 05:09.750
Because.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.750
Well, I can't argue
with that logic. You win.

05:18.333 --> 05:19.625
This is insane.

05:19.709 --> 05:21.458
10 minutes ago Skylar
kissed me on the cheek,

05:21.542 --> 05:23.417
and now she's trying to kill us.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.583
Women.

05:26.166 --> 05:28.917
There has to be something I can do
to make Skylar not evil.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.667
I just need to think.

05:30.750 --> 05:33.792
We don't have time.
Besides, thinking is for nerds.

05:35.625 --> 05:39.542
Wait. I think there's a remote in here
that contacts the League of Heroes.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.625
If we can find it, we can call for help.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.625
Okay. Ah...

05:44.750 --> 05:46.542
-Yes!
-You got it?

05:46.625 --> 05:48.000
No! I found a potato chip.

05:49.458 --> 05:52.041
-Halfsies?
-That's disgusting.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.583
-(sniffs) Sour cream and onion.
-Ooh, gimme.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.125
Oh! I found it.

05:59.208 --> 06:00.291
I found 12.

06:04.291 --> 06:05.792
Well, which one is it?

06:05.875 --> 06:07.250
There's only one way to find out.

06:08.291 --> 06:10.583
-(alarm blares)
-(voice) The hospital will self-destruct

06:10.667 --> 06:12.333
- in three, two--
-Turn it off!

06:13.959 --> 06:15.792
Self-destruct aborted.

06:16.458 --> 06:18.959
And they really need to allow
more than 3 seconds.

06:20.917 --> 06:22.291
Ah, let me try this one.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.625
Okay, I'll push it again.
Maybe they'll all disappear.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.125
Yeah, I should have seen that coming.

06:38.041 --> 06:39.959
Attention, everyone!

06:43.750 --> 06:45.417
I have an announcement to make.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.291
As temporary store manager

06:47.375 --> 06:50.375
I've decided who to name
as Employee of the Hour.

06:50.458 --> 06:52.375
Ta-da!

06:54.291 --> 06:56.291
Wait, that's not fair.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.542
Why do you get to be Employee
of the Hour and not me?

06:59.291 --> 07:00.125
Because.

07:00.959 --> 07:01.959
D'ah!

07:02.041 --> 07:04.583
You and your
rebuttal-proof arguments.

07:09.125 --> 07:10.542
Uh, it's a little crooked.

07:10.625 --> 07:13.583
-Oh.
-Oh-- no, not the picture-- your face.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.709
I just noticed your face
is a little crooked.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.834
I have an important task for you.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.583
Go stand over there,

07:21.667 --> 07:24.250
be quiet, and do absolutely nothing.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.750
Okay. Doing nothing runs in my family.

07:30.834 --> 07:33.291
(water running)

07:36.458 --> 07:38.375
(thinking) Uh-oh, a leak.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.959
She must have hit a pipe,

07:40.041 --> 07:42.375
and water is getting
on that valuable painting.

07:42.458 --> 07:46.041
But she told me to do nothing,
so I'll do nothing.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.375
Wait, now I'm thinking.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.250
Can she hear me thinking?

07:51.291 --> 07:52.667
Are you thinking?

07:54.458 --> 07:55.709
Man, she's good.

07:55.792 --> 07:58.500
No wonder old Crooked Face
got Employee of the Hour.

08:08.542 --> 08:09.709
For the last time,

08:09.792 --> 08:11.750
where are all the superhero files?

08:11.834 --> 08:14.291
I transferred them all
to a quantum chip,

08:14.375 --> 08:16.125
which I've hidden, so you--

08:19.333 --> 08:20.625
What are you doing?

08:20.709 --> 08:23.166
Sorry, I can see my reflection
in your helmet.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.667
My hair is cuckoo!

08:26.375 --> 08:28.625
I'll never tell you the location
of the quantum chip.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.417
I don't care what you do to me.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.333
Fine. Then I'll just torture
your beloved nephew instead.

08:33.417 --> 08:35.792
Zachary? Why?

08:35.875 --> 08:38.333
What has Zachary Diaz
ever done to you?

08:38.417 --> 08:40.041
Alan! I meant Alan.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.375
Oh. Well, these things happen.

08:44.083 --> 08:47.333
I suppose a little suffering
will build Alan's character.

08:47.417 --> 08:48.291
I'll go find him.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.333
You're not going anywhere.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.125
I'm going to immobilize you
with your own power.

08:57.458 --> 08:58.667
And when I find Alan,

08:58.750 --> 09:01.000
I'll bring him here
and torture him in front of you.

09:03.208 --> 09:07.875
(Horace) He forgot that my powers
are weakened and I can still move.

09:07.959 --> 09:10.917
If I can only reach this.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.792
Oh, my hair!

09:17.458 --> 09:18.875
Only two left.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.375
Ohh! This one also does nothing.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.875
This is the League of Heroes.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.625
Hi! Hi, uh,
we're calling from Mighty Med.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.333
We're under attack from the Annihilator,
and the fate of the world--

09:38.417 --> 09:40.750
Please listen carefully
as our menu options have changed.

09:40.834 --> 09:42.792
For English, press one.

09:42.875 --> 09:46.041
For Gorgolblarn, press...
(gibbers, blows raspberry)

09:54.500 --> 09:55.917
Don't bother calling for help.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I eliminated the guards

09:58.083 --> 10:00.417
and I put up an energy barrier
around the building,

10:00.500 --> 10:03.542
so no one is getting in or out.

10:03.625 --> 10:05.208
And now to destroy

10:05.291 --> 10:07.750
the only people
left standing in my way.

10:11.417 --> 10:14.083
Are you gonna tell us who?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.625
She means us!

10:20.291 --> 10:22.667
Wait. Why would you get rid of us?

10:22.750 --> 10:26.834
You know, we have a ton of valuable
information about superheroes,

10:26.917 --> 10:29.542
and you could torture us slowly
over a long period of time

10:29.625 --> 10:31.834
to get us to talk,
and then get rid of us.

10:31.917 --> 10:34.417
That's even better
than what I had in mind.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.291
Good plan, Kaz. Thanks.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.667
What is wrong with you?

10:40.333 --> 10:42.542
I was trying to buy us some time.

10:42.625 --> 10:45.750
But you have to admit,
I am on fire with ideas today.

11:01.208 --> 11:02.709
This is not good, okay?

11:02.792 --> 11:06.083
There is no bathroom
and I had a bran muffin this morning,

11:06.166 --> 11:08.083
so things are about to
get real up in here!

11:08.959 --> 11:10.166
Wait.

11:10.750 --> 11:13.291
We're forgetting about Alan.
He used the escape pod.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.667
He's probably out contacting
a ton of superheroes

11:15.750 --> 11:17.959
who can figure out a way
to break in and save us.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.291
Or he was immediately
captured by Skylar.

11:21.792 --> 11:23.792
Yeah, that's probably more likely.

11:24.834 --> 11:27.625
Alan, what happened
with the escape pod?

11:27.709 --> 11:32.250
Well, I got in, sat down,
and then I fell asleep.

11:32.375 --> 11:34.834
Oh, the seats are so comfortable!

11:34.917 --> 11:36.667
I mean, talk about escape --

11:36.750 --> 11:39.458
escape from your worries.

11:40.875 --> 11:43.625
And then Skylar woke me up
and attacked me.

11:43.709 --> 11:45.875
What a scaredy-cat.

11:45.959 --> 11:46.875
I'm not name-calling.

11:46.959 --> 11:48.500
He got scared
and turned into a cat.

11:52.917 --> 11:54.083
This is not good.

11:54.166 --> 11:55.709
I just had a bowl of cream.

11:55.792 --> 11:57.542
And there's no litter box.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.417
Things are about to
get real up in here.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.709
(footsteps approaching)

12:13.333 --> 12:14.709
I can't find Alan,

12:14.792 --> 12:17.083
so I'll just have
to torture you instead.

12:19.750 --> 12:22.417
Now where is the quantum chip?

12:22.500 --> 12:23.875
I'll never tell you.

12:24.542 --> 12:26.667
Hey, is that
someone over your shoulder

12:26.750 --> 12:28.792
you should turn around
and look at?

12:29.709 --> 12:31.083
Aha!

12:31.166 --> 12:34.250
It was a trick,
a ruse, a gambit, a ploy.

12:35.417 --> 12:37.792
Sorry, I'm halfway
through this thesaurus

12:37.875 --> 12:40.208
I'm reading, studying,
analyzing, perusing.

12:41.834 --> 12:45.041
If you fire that weapon at me,
I'll just absorb its power.

12:45.125 --> 12:46.625
Oh, it's not a weapon.

12:46.709 --> 12:50.333
It's a linguistic scrambler,
and I won't be firing it at you!

12:53.166 --> 12:54.792
What did you just do?

12:55.750 --> 12:58.041
(gibberish)
You can't understand me.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.417
I LOVE BRIDGES!

13:00.500 --> 13:02.542
(roars)

13:02.625 --> 13:06.625
Do you know Wallace and Clyde
sleep in twin racing car bunk beds?

13:06.709 --> 13:10.709
Their pillows say,
"Ready, set, go! ... to sleep."

13:12.542 --> 13:14.583
What are you staring at?

13:14.667 --> 13:16.250
Ohh!

13:18.583 --> 13:21.041
-What happened to this painting?
-There was a leak.

13:21.125 --> 13:23.083
Well then,
why didn't you do something?

13:23.166 --> 13:24.959
You told me to do nothing.

13:25.041 --> 13:26.208
You're welcome.

13:27.542 --> 13:30.417
Okay, maybe this painting
isn't worth that much.

13:31.959 --> 13:32.917
Are you kidding me?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.500
It cost $6,000!
What are we gonna do?

13:40.041 --> 13:42.667
There. Now it only costs 99 cents.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.625
You can't just change the price.

13:46.709 --> 13:49.083
This is the most valuable item
in the store.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.125
Wallace and Clyde
are going to kill me.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.041
They wouldn't dare kill you

13:53.125 --> 13:56.041
if you were worth... a million dollars.

13:57.792 --> 13:58.834
Gimme that!

14:01.500 --> 14:03.208
Now remember what I told you.

14:04.583 --> 14:05.667
It's not going to work.

14:05.750 --> 14:08.875
We can do this. Just concentrate.

14:08.959 --> 14:10.041
Ready?

14:12.792 --> 14:15.625
("Chopsticks" plays)

14:18.166 --> 14:19.625
Would you stop?

14:21.709 --> 14:24.375
That sounds terrible.
It's completely out of tune.

14:25.500 --> 14:29.458
But more importantly,
we have to stop the Annihilator

14:29.542 --> 14:31.375
from getting
that superhero information.

14:31.458 --> 14:32.458
But we're trapped.

14:32.542 --> 14:35.542
And no heroes can get in
because of Skylar's energy barrier.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.458
And the only thing
that can break that barrier

14:37.542 --> 14:38.709
is the Crystal of Kreln...

14:38.792 --> 14:40.709
which was lost
in the battle of Kreln

14:40.792 --> 14:43.750
during the Kreln rebellion
on the planet Kreln

14:43.834 --> 14:47.250
during the year 2165 BK --
before Kreln.

14:48.542 --> 14:50.250
This crystal of...

14:50.333 --> 14:51.834
What's it called again?

14:53.667 --> 14:56.125
Kreln. I just said it like five times.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.291
Right.

14:57.375 --> 15:00.166
I've seen it. It's in the Domain.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.583
That's a toy.

15:02.417 --> 15:03.250
Wait.

15:03.333 --> 15:04.750
What if it's not a toy?

15:04.834 --> 15:06.333
I mean, Wallace and Clyde

15:06.417 --> 15:08.208
did have half
of the real Dyad of Nebulon.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.375
Maybe they have
the real crystal of Kreln.

15:10.458 --> 15:13.667
They did tell me they have
lots of real devices in the store.

15:13.750 --> 15:16.500
I thought they were just
trying to overcharge me.

15:19.041 --> 15:21.667
Better be real, because this is
the only chance we have.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.625
Right, now we have
to contact a superhero

15:23.709 --> 15:26.041
who can get the crystal
and then storm Mighty Med.

15:26.125 --> 15:29.000
We can call Henry Tidwell,
Titanio's alter ego.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.041
There's no reception.

15:32.125 --> 15:35.125
That's because we're 300 feet
below Mighty Med.

15:35.792 --> 15:38.375
And I may have dropped
your phone in the toilet yesterday.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.625
We're never gonna get out of here.

15:49.667 --> 15:50.709
Whoa.

15:52.417 --> 15:54.250
Someone must have tunneled
out of here.

15:54.333 --> 15:56.166
I hope this leads to an art store

15:56.250 --> 16:00.375
because Oliver ripped
our one nice decoration.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.750
I need a plan.

16:06.834 --> 16:10.041
If I were in charge
I'd dry the painting with that rag.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.834
It was tied around
Alan's mouth like a big kiss.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.458
Oh, no, I made it worse!

16:23.542 --> 16:25.750
Yes, you did.

16:26.834 --> 16:27.792
But I can fix it.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.917
I just took a course in portrait painting.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.959
You won't be able to tell the difference.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.750
Did I not mention it was
a course on self portraits?

16:37.125 --> 16:38.375
(roars)

16:38.458 --> 16:41.667
Come here! Come here!

16:42.500 --> 16:43.542
Wait, wait.

16:43.625 --> 16:45.000
I just realized something.

16:45.083 --> 16:46.750
We could just leave the store,

16:46.834 --> 16:49.750
take that stuff and no one will
ever know this is our fault.

16:49.834 --> 16:50.834
You're right.

16:50.917 --> 16:53.792
There's nobody here
but you and me

16:53.875 --> 16:57.041
and that security camera that's filmed
everything we've done.

16:57.875 --> 16:59.625
Well, now what do we do?

16:59.709 --> 17:04.250
Well, given that there's a camera,
there's only one thing to do.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.750
I've always wanted
my own talk show.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.041
(gibberish) Hey there Skylar.

17:14.125 --> 17:16.250
Does my hair still look cuckoo?

17:18.083 --> 17:19.291
What's going on?

17:19.375 --> 17:22.166
Have you tortured Horace and learnt
the location of the quantum chip?

17:22.250 --> 17:24.375
Torturing him won't do any good.

17:24.458 --> 17:27.250
He blasted himself with a device
and now his speech is scrambled.

17:27.333 --> 17:31.291
That is correct. You will ...

17:31.375 --> 17:33.250
never understand a single word
I say until the effect wears off--

17:34.166 --> 17:35.250
Never mind.

17:36.375 --> 17:37.625
Oh, no more, please!

17:37.709 --> 17:39.583
Please! I'll tell you everything.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.250
We haven't even started
torturing you yet.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.417
But you pinched my skin a little

17:44.500 --> 17:46.458
when you grabbed my arm
and it really hurts.

17:47.458 --> 17:50.375
Just let me go and I'll take you
to the quantum chip.

17:59.792 --> 18:01.166
Bub-bub-bub --don't look.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.750
(beeping)

18:10.625 --> 18:12.417
What was that pill? Tell us.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.750
(Kaz) Oliver, get in the tunnel.

18:22.834 --> 18:25.875
I can't. I have a fear
of dark, cramped spaces.

18:25.959 --> 18:28.166
-(Kaz) Get in here!
-Fine.

18:28.250 --> 18:31.083
I'll just close my eyes.
We'll probably be killed anyway.

18:31.834 --> 18:34.375
(Alan) Stop being
such a Chicken Little.

18:34.458 --> 18:38.250
(mimicking) Oh, the sky is falling!
The sky is falling!

18:43.875 --> 18:46.291
Great, we're in another cell.

18:49.250 --> 18:51.792
-Oh, no.
-Uhhh!

18:51.875 --> 18:54.667
(Oliver) I have to admit, when you close
your eyes it's really not so bad.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.500
(screaming)

19:01.291 --> 19:03.125
Oh, no.

19:05.208 --> 19:08.792
Oliver, I believe you've met Megahertz.

19:12.291 --> 19:13.709
Enchanté.

19:15.333 --> 19:19.125
We've got to get to that
camera and erase the video. But how?

19:19.208 --> 19:22.792
There's no ladder. Maybe you could reach
it with that grappling hook.

19:23.750 --> 19:24.583
Okay.

19:36.166 --> 19:38.625
I destroyed the display case!

19:38.709 --> 19:40.500
Yes, you did.

19:40.583 --> 19:42.625
This is a nightmare!

19:42.709 --> 19:45.166
Wait.
I have a great idea.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.792
Why don't we make
a staircase

19:46.875 --> 19:49.917
using all these boxes of novelty
fake security cameras?

19:53.792 --> 19:56.333
They're fake. There's no camera.

19:56.417 --> 19:57.709
There's no recording.

19:57.792 --> 19:59.917
So no one saw my talk show?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.208
Now I know how Arsenio Hall feels.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.709
Do you know what this means?

20:06.792 --> 20:09.542
We're not gonna get in trouble
for ruining the painting

20:09.625 --> 20:11.041
or wrecking the store.

20:11.125 --> 20:12.667
We're home free.

20:16.125 --> 20:19.458
You just heard everything
we said, didn't you?

20:21.625 --> 20:22.500
Okay.

20:23.458 --> 20:26.625
Well, it's all his fault. He's in charge.

20:29.125 --> 20:31.834
Hey, Megahertz, old buddy,

20:31.917 --> 20:33.834
I love what you've
done with the cell.

20:33.917 --> 20:36.250
Ah! (tone plays)

20:36.333 --> 20:38.750
And your force field
is perfectly in tune.

20:40.208 --> 20:42.375
This isn't my cell.

20:42.458 --> 20:45.375
This is the Chamber
of Certain Destruction.

20:45.458 --> 20:48.250
Hey, but at least they
let you bring some toys

20:48.333 --> 20:49.667
to entertain yourself.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.375
Those aren't toys!

20:51.458 --> 20:53.542
The punishment for repeat
offenders is to be turned

20:53.625 --> 20:58.250
into an action figure and sold
as a limited edition collectible.

20:59.709 --> 21:02.166
So that's the real Blood Chef
and Black Falcon?

21:02.250 --> 21:03.166
Yup.

21:03.250 --> 21:04.667
Cool!

21:05.625 --> 21:08.125
Hey, hey, look, look, they're kissing.

21:11.417 --> 21:14.125
(alarm blares)

21:14.208 --> 21:15.417
(Alan sniffs)

21:15.500 --> 21:18.542
Ooh, is somebody making
microwave popcorn?

21:19.500 --> 21:21.417
Yeah, but we're the popcorn!

21:21.500 --> 21:23.166
Oh, don't worry.

21:23.250 --> 21:28.458
It'll be over quickly, if you consider
4 minutes of complete agony "quickly".

21:28.542 --> 21:30.375
(alarm continues)

21:33.083 --> 21:35.667
(theme music playing)
