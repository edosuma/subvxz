00:14.890 --> 00:16.934
<i>Take wing and gather together.</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:19.520
<i>-The festival of stars is nigh.
<i>-You're amazing!</i></i>

00:19.603 --> 00:21.647
<i>It's the rookie we've been hoping for.</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:23.690
<i>-Keith.
<i>-Didn't you even know that?</i></i>

00:23.774 --> 00:26.026
IN CREMONA,
THERE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF MURDERS.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.362
DUE TO THE MARK LEFT BEHIND,
HE'S CALLED KILLER B.

01:12.656 --> 01:13.490
<i>Is she dead?</i>

01:16.952 --> 01:19.162
Nope, she's still alive!

01:19.246 --> 01:21.623
Then hurry up and get started!

01:22.291 --> 01:23.125
Sure.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.962
Let's clean our kill.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.900
Henry! Richard!

02:15.802 --> 02:20.599
KINGDOM OF CREMONA, OLD TOWN

02:39.701 --> 02:42.079
Hey! Freshly baked buns!

02:54.299 --> 02:57.177
Oh crap!

02:57.844 --> 02:59.721
Good morning, Lily.

02:59.805 --> 03:00.931
Morning, Koku!

03:01.014 --> 03:03.892
-Um, would you--
-Sorry, I'm running late!

03:03.975 --> 03:05.268
Maybe next time!

03:07.729 --> 03:10.857
But these are freshly baked red bean buns.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.703
Mom! Mom! I forgot my ID!

03:23.787 --> 03:26.123
What are you doing, you idiot?

03:32.254 --> 03:35.799
<i>This is 105. Homeless man's tent
<i>located off the forest road.</i></i>

03:35.882 --> 03:36.842
<i>This is 112.</i>

03:37.050 --> 03:40.220
<i>Bloodstains found in parking lot.
<i>Leaving them for the CSI.</i></i>

03:43.807 --> 03:46.143
-Good morning, ma'am!
-Shh!

03:50.021 --> 03:51.606
Good morning!

03:52.190 --> 03:54.317
Hey. You're late.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.944
Er, sorry about that.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.573
Want a red bean bun? Freshly baked!

04:00.115 --> 04:02.993
You can eat at a crime scene?
How impudent.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.372
So, are the victims more... you know?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.712
We linked our vics to multiple murders
in our jurisdiction.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.589
We had them pegged as serial killers,

04:18.675 --> 04:23.930
but before we could get an arrest warrant,
our misguided pal got to them.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.934
Killer B.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.862
-I'm sorry, sir, this area is--
-It's fine, shut up.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.072
-Shoo.
-Sir, I insist...

04:42.157 --> 04:43.784
Hey! Who the heck is that?

04:44.075 --> 04:45.786
Er, he said he's with the RIS.

04:45.869 --> 04:46.870
I don't know him!

04:47.037 --> 04:49.039
You can't let an outsider in here!

04:49.873 --> 04:51.875
Excuse me. I need your attention.

04:52.751 --> 04:57.172
This area is currently off-limits to all
but authorized personnel.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.969
Mister? Are you drunk?

05:03.470 --> 05:05.847
Civilians aren't allowed in--

05:08.183 --> 05:12.145
How have you been, Genie!
It's been a while!

05:12.687 --> 05:13.730
"Genie"?

05:14.189 --> 05:17.108
Eric and Jean are dying to see you!

05:17.651 --> 05:19.528
You should go see them!

05:28.954 --> 05:29.871
Hey.

05:31.289 --> 05:36.169
ROYAL POLICE, COASTAL BRANCH

05:38.630 --> 05:44.094
That covers pretty much all of the intel
we have so far. As for the rest...

05:44.177 --> 05:48.431
Wow. It's really Keith Flick, Mario!

05:52.727 --> 05:56.147
He's just an old has-been
who's been gone for 10 years.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.943
-Eric, everything's ready.
-Good.

06:01.194 --> 06:06.408
Before we begin, let me introduce someone.
Everyone, look to your two o'clock.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.746
The man standing next to Jean
is Keith Flick.

06:11.830 --> 06:16.459
As of today, he's rejoined our unit from
the Archives Division. Let's welcome him.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.877
Hey.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.671
Okay, Kaela. Begin.

06:22.757 --> 06:26.386
Early this morning, multiple bodies
were found in the forest area.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.055
The victims are the Crouse Brothers,
Henry and Richard.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.183
Both were killed
with a sharp, bladed weapon.

06:32.267 --> 06:37.105
An unconscious woman was also found.
She's been hospitalized for her injuries.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.067
We've confirmed that the Crouse Brothers,
including the youngest, Julian,

06:41.526 --> 06:44.321
-abducted, imprisoned, and raped her.
-Another psychopath, huh?

06:44.779 --> 06:48.116
Speaking of whom,
Julian Crouse's whereabouts are unknown.

06:54.080 --> 06:54.914
Kill!

06:55.915 --> 06:56.875
Kill!

06:57.459 --> 06:59.502
Kill! I'm gonna kill him!

07:03.506 --> 07:07.427
Kill! Kill! I'm definitely gonna--

07:07.510 --> 07:09.471
I can arrange a meeting.

07:10.931 --> 07:15.101
If you help me out
with one teeny, tiny thing.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.689
So, who killed these criminals?

07:20.357 --> 07:22.859
The RIS's job will be to focus on this.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.820
Commonly known as "Killer B."

07:26.154 --> 07:28.990
This is the lead suspect
we will be pursuing.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.203
I wish they'd call him
"The lousy misguided scumbag pal."

07:33.286 --> 07:34.913
You added "lousy" and "scumbag."

07:35.622 --> 07:39.626
We believe he has been involved
in 15 killings over the past few years.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.128
Mario, present your report.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.174
We've gone over this before,

07:46.257 --> 07:49.427
but since we have a newcomer,
I'll run through it again.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.723
Cause of death,
single blow from sharp blade.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.308
No defensive wounds.

07:55.934 --> 08:00.772
This means our perp sneaks up and
cuts his victims before they can cry out.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.817
It's certain that this guy is no amateur.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.694
Brandon. Do you have a profile?

08:05.777 --> 08:08.196
I've been working it from various angles,

08:08.279 --> 08:10.699
but without any keywords
to narrow it down,

08:10.782 --> 08:13.368
there's no way
to make it any more accurate.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.911
How about the mark?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.913
Kaela, can you put it up?

08:17.288 --> 08:18.373
Hang on.

08:19.541 --> 08:23.336
There's a countless number
of similar ones. It's just a "B."

08:24.462 --> 08:26.256
My eyes are dazzled.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.135
He's even got fan sites?

08:30.385 --> 08:31.720
I guess he's popular.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.097
I've got a whole lot more.

08:35.807 --> 08:36.640
Keith.

08:39.144 --> 08:42.397
When you look at this,
does anything jump out at you?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.443
Asleep, weren't you?

08:48.987 --> 08:52.824
-Kaela, put up those other images.
-Sure. Want them all?

08:52.991 --> 08:56.786
-Just don't dazzle Boris' eyes.
-I don't think that's possible.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.835
ARMY TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT DIVISION,
SECRET TRANSPORT

09:07.547 --> 09:09.007
What happened? Hey!

09:17.891 --> 09:22.020
COASTAL BRANCH, FORENSICS LAB

09:27.942 --> 09:28.777
I agree.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.530
You sure got old.

09:34.866 --> 09:35.700
Genie.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.245
There aren't any ashtrays.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.581
Everywhere's no-smoking these days.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.292
I quit smoking, too. Quite a while ago.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.548
This bitter swill sure takes me back.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.925
Don't drink it, then.

09:57.514 --> 10:01.142
It's the anniversary of her death, huh?
The year flew by.

10:01.476 --> 10:02.310
Yeah.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.406
Hard at work right after getting back,
I see.

10:15.490 --> 10:18.201
If you ever want bad coffee,
come by anytime.

10:18.993 --> 10:19.828
Sure.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.499
Oh, almost forgot.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.931
He knew I was lying?

10:45.353 --> 10:47.355
Assistance requested
by army and municipal police!

10:47.939 --> 10:50.024
Someone's attacking an army convoy!

10:50.650 --> 10:55.280
They've stolen an IFV and are now fleeing
towards the capital on the Aqua Line!

10:55.405 --> 10:57.574
The royal family has declared martial law!

10:57.657 --> 11:00.243
-We're to obey Gen. Bern's instructions!
-What's this?

11:00.702 --> 11:02.036
Is this a revolution?

11:02.537 --> 11:03.997
Everyone, get there ASAP!

11:04.080 --> 11:06.207
-Mario! Take command on scene!
-Roger!

11:06.457 --> 11:09.085
<i>Brandon, you're our liaison
<i>with the local cops!</i></i>

11:09.169 --> 11:10.128
<i>-Roger!
<i>-Boris!</i></i>

11:10.378 --> 11:13.590
<i>Could you handle the army?
<i>Please oversee our unit placement!</i></i>

11:13.882 --> 11:16.259
<i>-Wait, you want me to do it?
<i>-Yes, you!</i></i>

11:16.342 --> 11:17.844
<i>All right, fine.</i>

11:17.927 --> 11:19.220
<i>-Keith.
<i>-What?</i></i>

11:19.429 --> 11:22.307
<i>There's an emergency.
<i>I'd like your assistance.</i></i>

11:45.288 --> 11:47.832
You flies are getting on my nerves!

11:50.126 --> 11:51.753
This looks like trouble.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.838
Lily! We're gonna get behind it!

11:54.297 --> 11:56.716
<i>-Can you get ahead of or next to it?
-Uh...</i>

11:56.799 --> 11:58.051
Cut through the park!

11:58.676 --> 11:59.802
Rodger Dodger!

12:00.345 --> 12:02.138
W-Wait, Lily! Don't--

12:03.181 --> 12:08.019
I didn't mean it literally!
Use the road! The road!

12:08.811 --> 12:09.729
Target acquired!

12:10.897 --> 12:11.731
Lily!

12:12.982 --> 12:13.816
Here we come!

12:26.496 --> 12:29.207
-Lily! It's firing at us!
-Sorry! Falling back!

12:31.084 --> 12:31.918
Lily!

12:35.630 --> 12:38.841
We can't get near it with this car!
You get ahead of it!

12:39.175 --> 12:41.386
Where is he? Come on out!

12:41.803 --> 12:47.392
Show yourself, you monster!

12:57.402 --> 12:59.988
Die!

13:00.279 --> 13:03.157
I'll crush you all!

13:03.491 --> 13:06.744
This guy is nuts.
I have no idea what his objective is!

13:06.828 --> 13:08.621
We're not letting him get away!

13:10.540 --> 13:13.543
Julian, I hate to interrupt
while you're having fun,

13:14.419 --> 13:16.087
but it's time to lose them.

13:23.928 --> 13:24.971
Hey, Mario!

13:25.054 --> 13:26.180
Watch the sensors!

13:28.516 --> 13:30.560
A smoke screen and an APS?

13:31.519 --> 13:33.271
This isn't an ordinary IFV?

13:33.354 --> 13:35.356
It probably contains
carbon fiber particles.

13:36.024 --> 13:39.277
Radar waves are being jammed.
Unable to monitor situation.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.320
-Anything on thermal?
-Not a thing.

13:42.905 --> 13:46.576
Seal off all areas immediately.
Just get that thing contained.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.287
This is Alpha!

13:49.704 --> 13:52.832
Eric! Where'd the IFV go?
Requesting instructions!

13:58.379 --> 13:59.213
Damn it.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.924
Who are these people?

14:12.310 --> 14:13.561
Who were they?

14:14.395 --> 14:16.272
Hey, where are you taking me?

14:18.691 --> 14:19.901
Changing rides.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.987
The fun is just beginning.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.407
-Any sign of the IFV?
-Nothing yet.

14:26.949 --> 14:30.453
-Where did it vanish to?
-I'll boost the satellite's sensitivity.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.414
It's pointless. Pointless.

14:35.083 --> 14:38.336
I don't think you'll find them. Probably.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.715
Kaela, can we see
when the IFV entered the tunnel?

14:42.799 --> 14:43.883
Sure.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.220
Show me again.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.556
Let it loop for a while.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.313
Oh, I get it. That's...

14:59.690 --> 15:02.944
It's a hybrid IFV
that hasn't been made public yet.

15:03.027 --> 15:06.364
That sound is the high-pitched tone
an inverter makes.

15:06.447 --> 15:09.325
That's why it suddenly vanished
from the thermal.

15:09.575 --> 15:13.287
It's a new IFV with stealth capabilities
pushed to the limit.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.457
I remember reading about this somewhere.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.836
It's a cutting-edge IFV made
by our undeveloped military,

15:19.919 --> 15:21.879
independently and in top secret,

15:21.963 --> 15:24.465
free from meddling from other countries.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.467
Known as the 5-0.

15:28.678 --> 15:33.975
They effortlessly steal a top-secret item,
and after causing a childish ruckus,

15:34.225 --> 15:37.645
they exploited its capabilities
and vanished.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.524
A fool's prattling, or a wise man's words?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.943
A) INTELLECT, B) IMPULSE
A (WISE MAN) IS EXPLOITING B (FOOL)

15:44.026 --> 15:45.528
Either way, this is tricky.

15:46.654 --> 15:47.488
Now then.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.245
Which one is the real objective?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.138
What is that man doing?

16:13.514 --> 16:16.017
What are all those weird squares
and triangles?

16:16.225 --> 16:20.229
As I recall, he called it something like
the variable separation method.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.856
If you don't know, fine.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.276
I've known him for 20 years now.

16:26.110 --> 16:29.071
And I've never known what was going on
in his head!

16:29.155 --> 16:30.948
That's nothing to brag about.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.533
It's just...

16:33.075 --> 16:35.870
if you give him time, he'll show the way.

16:36.996 --> 16:37.830
To what?

16:38.414 --> 16:39.248
The answer.

16:41.876 --> 16:47.006
Diversion or robbery? Neither.
A diversion to facilitate a robbery.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.925
"WAYS TO AVOID THERMAL DETECTION"

16:49.008 --> 16:51.219
Two above, below, one above...

16:53.596 --> 16:54.430
Eric.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.557
-Remember this place?
-Hey! The monitor!

16:56.641 --> 16:58.518
That's a monitor! It's expensive!

17:00.228 --> 17:02.271
The grounds of Oris Heavy Industries?

17:02.939 --> 17:05.233
And what's beneath it?

17:05.650 --> 17:07.902
The abandoned Alpine Metro line.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.155
It connects to the trans-island railway!

17:15.785 --> 17:18.746
The summit's station
is now the Museum of Flight.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.554
<i>Alpha! Go to the old Alpine Metro line's
<i>starting station.</i></i>

17:34.971 --> 17:37.139
<i>Beta! Get to the Museum of Flight!</i>

17:38.224 --> 17:42.061
Kaela, alert the military, too.
Have them keep an eye on the skies!

17:42.144 --> 17:42.979
Roger that!

17:49.569 --> 17:50.444
<i>Please respond.</i>

17:50.987 --> 17:53.573
<i>Train 645, this is railway police!</i>

17:54.407 --> 17:55.866
<i>Please respond, train 645!</i>

17:59.912 --> 18:02.582
He's really going to show up, right?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.668
Because if you're lying...

18:09.338 --> 18:10.965
Message from railway police!

18:11.048 --> 18:13.926
Runaway freight train
on National Rail loop line two!

18:14.010 --> 18:15.219
Shall I divert Alpha?

18:15.428 --> 18:19.181
Ignore it. The police and army
will home in on that, anyway.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.809
The IFV isn't on it.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.062
The fool who's hard at work
on that freight train

18:25.146 --> 18:28.190
will be made out to be the perpetrator
when it's over.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.651
Just wait for it to stop.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.653
He's here.

18:39.827 --> 18:40.786
You!

18:42.079 --> 18:43.164
Is it you?

18:43.581 --> 18:45.458
You really came!

18:45.791 --> 18:46.709
Hey, you--

18:50.713 --> 18:52.923
Thank you for your hard work.

19:04.101 --> 19:04.935
He showed up?

19:05.102 --> 19:05.936
Yes.

19:07.063 --> 19:07.897
Is it him?

19:08.522 --> 19:11.359
If Quinn doesn't return,
we'll know for sure.

19:20.076 --> 19:23.704
I've been ordered
to offer you an invitation.

19:25.414 --> 19:29.669
This is a human that I'm allowed to kill.
He deserves to die.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.881
Oh, I understand! It's sudden,
and now's not a good time for you!

19:34.340 --> 19:36.342
So that's why...

19:37.343 --> 19:39.845
I'm gonna "invite" you
in my own special way!

19:40.346 --> 19:43.557
They found us sooner than expected.
We'll leave that behind.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.393
Huh? After all this trouble?

19:46.143 --> 19:46.977
The gas?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.020
Got it all.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.232
We're switching to plan B.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.858
Minatsuki. What about Quinn?

19:53.859 --> 19:55.277
Plan B, he said.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.157
In other words, we abandon Quinn.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.035
Understood.

20:05.079 --> 20:08.958
Hey! What's the matter?
Show me your skills! Your power!

20:09.041 --> 20:11.085
The real you! Come on!

20:19.176 --> 20:23.514
If you have no penitence in your heart,
atone for your sins with your death.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.401
Lohengrin.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.154
The black-winged king.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.158
He exists.

20:44.285 --> 20:48.330
He really exists, Minatsuki!

20:51.167 --> 20:54.211
-Li-Li-Lily!
-Don't talk, you'll bite your tongue off!

21:01.218 --> 21:02.052
Boris, sorry!

21:06.182 --> 21:07.016
Don't move!

21:15.483 --> 21:16.942
What's going on?

21:20.154 --> 21:23.324
Don't be in such a rush!
Let's enjoy ourselves a little!

21:24.950 --> 21:26.327
Oh, wow!

21:27.411 --> 21:31.081
Still, I just need to make sure
you don't hit me!

21:31.499 --> 21:34.251
I'll take that arm of yours!

22:45.364 --> 22:47.449
I guess I misread this.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.495
This was the main objective.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.846
"Case is closed," huh?

23:09.722 --> 23:10.806
Like hell it is!

23:11.098 --> 23:13.183
They're gonna say the train overturned

23:13.267 --> 23:16.020
and the IFV was ditched
in the mountains!

23:16.312 --> 23:17.396
I don't doubt it.

23:17.479 --> 23:20.107
That story is more convenient
for all involved.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.109
-This is so damn fishy!
-Ow!

23:22.610 --> 23:24.111
What are you doing, Bran?

23:24.194 --> 23:25.029
Look at this!

23:27.781 --> 23:28.616
Hey, that's...

23:29.116 --> 23:29.950
It can't be.

23:31.702 --> 23:33.912
Come on, it's just a coincidence.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.956
Yeah, it must be.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.629
Are you seeing my marks?

23:45.799 --> 23:47.134
I'll keep on killing.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.513
Until you find me.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.270
I found you.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.608
<i>I'll find you.</i>

24:04.777 --> 24:05.611
I'm...

24:08.822 --> 24:09.657
right here.
