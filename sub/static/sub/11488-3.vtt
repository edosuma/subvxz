00:01.665 --> 00:03.947
Yo, dude!
What up?

00:05.202 --> 00:06.761
Just follow my lead.

00:07.594 --> 00:09.807
Oh... This is awesome.

00:10.361 --> 00:14.524
Just a little surf shack,
where I keep my board, beer and brother.

00:16.261 --> 00:18.553
How are they breaking today, broheim?

00:20.236 --> 00:21.709
How are what breaking?

00:22.176 --> 00:24.927
Dude smokes way too much weed.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.321
The waves, Poindexter!

00:28.342 --> 00:32.079
Oh, the waves, the uh...
the waves are...

00:33.375 --> 00:34.665
early?

00:36.223 --> 00:38.081
Alright!
Let's hit it!

00:38.407 --> 00:40.513
Oh, I intend to.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.519
Why don't you head out,
I'll throw on my suit and meet you there.

00:44.561 --> 00:45.914
Awesome!

00:49.101 --> 00:52.591
Hmm, bodacious and tubular.

00:54.599 --> 00:57.584
Uh, excuse me,
moon doggie,

00:57.652 --> 00:58.685
quick question.

00:58.687 --> 00:59.446
Yeah?

00:59.457 --> 01:01.051
You don't surf, do you?

01:01.059 --> 01:02.569
Not a bit.

01:02.902 --> 01:06.609
Well how did Gidget get the idea
you are the big Kahuna?

01:06.627 --> 01:10.008
I told her I hang ten,
and I guess she misunderstood.

01:10.712 --> 01:12.456
You're going to hell, you know?

01:12.468 --> 01:16.157
I don't think so, I believe in a loving
God who forgives little fibs

01:16.158 --> 01:18.967
as long as they lead to recreational sex.

01:19.549 --> 01:21.721
You really want to drag God into this?

01:21.726 --> 01:23.868
He gave me the penis, Alan.

01:25.736 --> 01:27.624
Since when do you have a wetsuit?

01:27.656 --> 01:32.206
Since I moved to the beach,
and noticed it was full of hot surfer chicks.

01:35.098 --> 01:39.974
If I lived next to Jellystone Park,
I'd have a bear suit and a pic-a-nic basket.

01:41.696 --> 01:43.257
Would you get the door?

01:47.544 --> 01:48.957
Oopsie...

01:49.105 --> 01:52.759
Smooth. So...
just out of curiosity,

01:53.643 --> 01:55.769
how exactly do you plan
to pull this off?

01:55.788 --> 01:56.953
Simple...

01:57.625 --> 02:00.613
Paddle out, yell "shark", and paddle in.

02:00.641 --> 02:01.771
So you thought this through?

02:01.781 --> 02:03.976
I'm not an idiot.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.699
Oopsie.

02:10.662 --> 02:12.333
Over here.

02:12.530 --> 02:13.948
Careful.

02:13.970 --> 02:15.575
What happened?

02:15.578 --> 02:16.881
I don't know!

02:16.884 --> 02:19.152
This tiny wave came at us,
I let it go,

02:19.158 --> 02:22.236
he screamed like a girl
and fell off his board.

02:22.753 --> 02:26.032
I had to give him mouth to mouth,
he swallowed a lot of water.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.028
He's gonna be okay?

02:28.034 --> 02:31.451
I think so,
he tried slipping me the tongue.

02:31.773 --> 02:34.452
Charlie, can you hear me?

02:36.315 --> 02:37.803
Sha...

02:37.804 --> 02:38.816
What?

02:39.085 --> 02:40.675
Shaa...

02:40.811 --> 02:43.080
I think he's trying to say "shark".

02:45.488 --> 02:48.167
Episode 4x03
"The Sea is a Harsh Mistress"

02:48.206 --> 02:50.974
Transcript/Synchro: Porkepick
Corrections: Bouliii

02:51.014 --> 02:53.895
http://z11.invisionfree.com/taahm/

02:57.473 --> 02:58.894
Want something to drink?

02:58.906 --> 03:00.812
Oh, yeah...

03:07.848 --> 03:08.934
What is this?

03:08.935 --> 03:10.104
Water.

03:10.115 --> 03:13.474
You're crazy?
I almost drowned in that stuff!

03:17.874 --> 03:19.580
Where is my little hard body?

03:19.600 --> 03:21.907
He took off with
that girl you brought home.

03:24.956 --> 03:27.456
Other than that,
your plan worked like a charm.

03:27.527 --> 03:30.181
Fine, go ahead and mock me,

03:30.313 --> 03:31.773
but I could have died out there.

03:31.787 --> 03:34.555
Well, the Sea is a harsh mistress,

03:35.195 --> 03:36.406
and...

03:36.413 --> 03:37.832
you're a moron.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.347
What? You said to mock you.

03:41.896 --> 03:43.071
It's no joke, Alan.

03:43.085 --> 03:46.366
Oh, come on! You try to scam
your way into a surfbunny shorts,

03:46.367 --> 03:49.721
and ended up french-kissing
a handsome young life-guard.

03:50.576 --> 03:52.550
How is that not a joke?

03:53.871 --> 03:56.332
It's not a joke, because...

03:57.749 --> 03:59.125
Something...

03:59.136 --> 04:01.193
happened out there
while I was drowning.

04:01.214 --> 04:05.591
What? Did your entire, sordid,
degenerate life flash before your eyes?

04:05.615 --> 04:07.093
I wish...

04:09.141 --> 04:11.470
No! No, no, it was...

04:12.143 --> 04:13.938
ah, you're not gonna believe me.

04:14.037 --> 04:15.387
Try me.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.091
I saw Dad.

04:19.107 --> 04:20.947
Oh baloney.

04:22.005 --> 04:23.603
You know what?
Just forget it.

04:23.609 --> 04:27.594
Oh, come on! It was probably just
a hallucination caused by, you know,

04:27.601 --> 04:29.287
brain cells dying.

04:31.281 --> 04:33.471
No, I'm used to that.

04:35.186 --> 04:37.932
This, was no hallucination.

04:37.969 --> 04:40.320
Dad was right there
in the water with me.

04:40.679 --> 04:42.772
Alright, for the sake of argument,

04:42.774 --> 04:46.951
let's assume that you saw the spirit of
our dead father, what did he do,

04:46.965 --> 04:49.526
reach a hand out
to guide you to the great beyond?

04:49.527 --> 04:51.601
Don't be ridiculous...

04:52.728 --> 04:54.996
He didn't have hands.

04:56.338 --> 05:01.139
It was just his head, kinda...
floating there, like...

05:01.151 --> 05:04.121
the great powerful Oz.

05:05.633 --> 05:08.135
Or one of the Pep Boys.

05:11.438 --> 05:13.044
Manny, Moe or Jack?

05:13.053 --> 05:14.541
Manny.

05:18.077 --> 05:19.390
And he spoke to me...

05:19.404 --> 05:23.624
Oh! You were able to hear him,
under water? How weird.

05:23.636 --> 05:26.123
Oh that's the part that bumps you?

05:26.736 --> 05:28.605
I'm just saying that
you were able to hear him

05:28.622 --> 05:30.731
because you were imagining him,
it was in your head.

05:30.732 --> 05:32.421
No, oh no...

05:32.776 --> 05:36.497
In a million years, my mind could not
have made up what he said to me.

05:36.498 --> 05:37.873
What did he say?

05:39.106 --> 05:42.482
Something that made my blood run cold.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.800
What?

05:45.564 --> 05:47.232
Never mind, I probably heard him wrong.

05:47.245 --> 05:49.855
-Charlie!
-Please don't make me say it!

05:49.856 --> 05:53.115
Come on Charlie, I am your brother.
Whatever it was,

05:53.141 --> 05:55.149
we'll deal with it together.

05:57.061 --> 05:58.675
He said:

05:59.073 --> 06:02.547
"Take care of your mother."

06:07.545 --> 06:09.571
Well good luck with that.

06:15.573 --> 06:16.911
Hey.

06:16.998 --> 06:18.247
Hey.

06:18.249 --> 06:20.432
Dad said you almost drowned today.

06:21.016 --> 06:22.187
Yep...

06:22.331 --> 06:23.947
Are you okay now?

06:23.974 --> 06:25.353
I'm fine.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.549
Can I ask you a question?

06:27.689 --> 06:28.796
Sure.

06:28.797 --> 06:31.017
It's about what happens when you die.

06:31.061 --> 06:32.407
OK.

06:32.565 --> 06:34.332
Who gets your car?

06:37.251 --> 06:38.920
Go away.

06:39.818 --> 06:42.405
You're right,
it's not a good time to ask.

06:44.087 --> 06:45.565
So...

06:45.829 --> 06:47.171
what 'you doing?

06:48.430 --> 06:50.159
Thinking about Dad.

06:50.721 --> 06:51.915
Yeah...

06:51.965 --> 06:53.055
About that,

06:53.081 --> 06:54.589
I was wondering,

06:54.814 --> 06:56.025
when you saw him,

06:56.041 --> 06:58.080
assuming you saw him...

06:58.127 --> 06:59.317
Did he...

06:59.715 --> 07:01.190
ask about me?

07:01.962 --> 07:03.052
No.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.738
He just said:
"Take care of your mother".

07:05.754 --> 07:06.924
Huh...

07:06.930 --> 07:08.662
Didn't... didn't mention me at all?

07:08.688 --> 07:09.964
No...

07:09.965 --> 07:11.514
Typical.

07:12.929 --> 07:14.128
Oh here we go.

07:14.130 --> 07:16.653
I'm just saying, the guy
doesn't get in touch for 30 years,

07:16.659 --> 07:19.614
it wouldn't kill him
to throw in a quick "Hello Alan!"

07:19.865 --> 07:22.104
Dead or alive,
that's just rude.

07:22.198 --> 07:23.399
I'll tell you what...

07:23.408 --> 07:24.863
Why don't you go fill up the tub,

07:24.871 --> 07:27.049
I'll hold your head under the water
until the bubbles stop,

07:27.050 --> 07:30.089
and then you can tell him
how offended you are.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.125
Oh no, I have nothing
to say to him now.

07:37.287 --> 07:40.080
How does he expect me
to take care of her?

07:40.102 --> 07:43.504
I don't know, why don't you try
treating her like a human being?

07:44.380 --> 07:46.387
Nah, that can't be it.

07:47.033 --> 07:49.696
What if I put her in
an assisted living facility?

07:50.037 --> 07:51.928
That's ridiculous,
she's a healthy woman.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.627
I'm not saying she wouldn't put up a fight...

07:54.643 --> 07:56.892
But hey, crumble up
a few Xanax in her mermosa,

07:56.897 --> 08:00.533
and we could probably coax her
into a cave full of bats.

08:01.437 --> 08:03.747
I don't think that's what Dad meant.

08:03.847 --> 08:04.876
How do you know?

08:04.880 --> 08:08.170
Did he talk to you?
No! He talked to me.

08:08.504 --> 08:10.438
Sure, rub my nose in it.

08:10.905 --> 08:12.105
How about this...

08:12.106 --> 08:15.966
When was the last time you called her,
just to see how she was doing?

08:16.001 --> 08:17.515
Uh...

08:17.546 --> 08:19.140
What's today, Sunday?

08:19.141 --> 08:21.114
Then... never.

08:21.759 --> 08:23.309
Why don't you start with that?

08:25.047 --> 08:27.298
OK, fine.

08:27.745 --> 08:29.444
Remember her number?

08:29.483 --> 08:31.415
I've got it on speed dial...

08:31.445 --> 08:33.815
666.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.734
Cute, uh?

08:38.283 --> 08:40.061
Hey Mom, it's Charlie.

08:40.691 --> 08:43.888
Nothing's the matter,
I just called to see how you're doing.

08:44.564 --> 08:49.271
No, I'm not drunk, I was just thinking
about you and thought I'd call.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.608
I swear to God,
I'm not drunk!

08:52.615 --> 08:56.311
Peter Piper picked a peck of
pickled peppers! Are you happy?

08:57.118 --> 09:00.133
So, what's going on?
I haven't talked to you in a while...

09:00.577 --> 09:03.696
Well, I'm talking to you now!

09:05.532 --> 09:08.835
OK, OK, OK.

09:08.926 --> 09:11.038
OK, excuse me?

09:11.513 --> 09:14.829
OK, OK, OK...

09:15.542 --> 09:16.766
So...

09:17.167 --> 09:19.007
Everything OK?

09:20.466 --> 09:22.624
I'm taking her to lunch tomorrow.

09:22.935 --> 09:24.762
Voluntarily?

09:25.012 --> 09:28.478
Wow, you must have really had
a spiritual experience out there...

09:28.490 --> 09:31.107
Let's face it Alan.
When Dad was alive,

09:31.140 --> 09:32.723
I was a rotten son.

09:32.732 --> 09:35.129
Oh, you sure were,
you were horrible.

09:35.145 --> 09:38.262
-Boy, I remember the time...
-The point is...

09:38.424 --> 09:41.177
Maybe I've got a chance
to make up for it now.

09:41.575 --> 09:45.517
He wants me to take care of mom,
then... that's what we're gonna do.

09:45.639 --> 09:48.592
Well, that's...
Wait a minute, did you say "we"?

09:49.358 --> 09:51.494
-I'm not going.
-Fine.

09:51.525 --> 09:55.887
Next time I see our father's floating head,
I'm gonna tell him you refused to help.

09:56.126 --> 09:59.721
I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna tell him...
God, you're such a child...

09:59.747 --> 10:02.053
-So you're coming?
-Yeah...

10:04.727 --> 10:09.457
I can't tell you what a treat it is
to have lunch with my two favorite sons!

10:09.486 --> 10:11.075
You have others?

10:11.581 --> 10:13.455
It's an expression, Charlie...

10:13.754 --> 10:16.405
Although I do sponsor
a little boy in Africa.

10:16.413 --> 10:19.648
-No kidding?
-Oh yes, little Mabutu!

10:20.606 --> 10:24.471
He's in a middle of a civil war,
and I still hear from him more than you.

10:25.834 --> 10:29.039
Hey Alan, tell mom what that
little rascal Jake's been up to.

10:30.142 --> 10:32.801
He hasn't been up to anything.

10:36.459 --> 10:39.028
OK... So...

10:41.455 --> 10:43.218
I think I'll go to the bathroom.

10:43.256 --> 10:44.535
Why?

10:44.693 --> 10:46.596
What do you mean "why"?
I have to go.

10:46.597 --> 10:49.140
When was the last time
you had a prostate exam?

10:49.153 --> 10:51.048
It feels like I'm having one now.

10:51.103 --> 10:54.911
I'm just expressing concern for
your health, you don't have to get snippy.

10:54.924 --> 10:56.723
I'm not being snippy.

10:56.738 --> 10:59.572
Is it just me or is he snippy?

11:00.227 --> 11:01.710
Try living with him.

11:01.717 --> 11:03.099
Charming.

11:03.561 --> 11:05.125
Alright, what's going on?

11:05.192 --> 11:07.322
What makes you think
something's going on?

11:07.424 --> 11:11.727
When one of my sons calls me for
no reason and agrees to take me to lunch,

11:11.730 --> 11:13.707
something heinous is going on.

11:13.723 --> 11:17.492
Hey, I took you to lunch two weeks ago
for no reason other than I love you.

11:17.493 --> 11:20.439
Oh yes, the tacky little
chain restaurant in the valley,

11:20.451 --> 11:23.605
That fish shot out of me
like there was a fire drill.

11:25.444 --> 11:28.135
The point is, I love you.

11:28.166 --> 11:31.487
The point is, I lost 4 pounds in 2 days.

11:32.867 --> 11:34.168
Well, you do look thinner.

11:34.176 --> 11:39.132
It's too late for flattery darling,
now what is going on with your brother?

11:39.275 --> 11:41.734
I don't think he'd be very happy
with me if I told you.

11:41.745 --> 11:45.354
Sweetheart, you're not
his favorite person now...

11:46.274 --> 11:47.286
OK.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.686
Here's the thing...

11:49.507 --> 11:51.498
Charlie almost drowned yesterday.

11:51.518 --> 11:55.147
Oh, dear Lord,
I told him over and over again.

11:55.211 --> 11:57.301
2 drinks max in the hot tub.

11:57.355 --> 11:58.644
No, he was surfing.

11:58.679 --> 12:00.712
-In the hot tub?
-In the ocean.

12:00.737 --> 12:02.309
Start again.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.880
He was trying to impress some girl...

12:04.882 --> 12:06.266
Oh, OK.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.940
Like the time he broke
his nose playing taboo.

12:08.968 --> 12:10.231
Exactly.

12:10.234 --> 12:14.622
Anyway... He was convinced
he was near death, and...

12:15.217 --> 12:16.926
that he saw dad.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.093
He saw your father?

12:20.353 --> 12:21.653
Wow...

12:22.881 --> 12:24.342
How did he look?

12:24.612 --> 12:26.688
He was just kind of a floating head.

12:26.696 --> 12:29.232
Yeah, that's pretty much
how I remember him.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.440
Fairly useless from the neck down.

12:31.443 --> 12:32.779
Anyway...

12:32.789 --> 12:36.363
Dad told Charlie to take care of you.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.700
Really?

12:41.612 --> 12:42.693
Anything else?

12:42.709 --> 12:45.290
No that's it,
just for him to take care of you.

12:45.294 --> 12:47.535
It's like I might as well not even exist.

12:47.546 --> 12:53.685
Oh Alan, you can't take that personally.
First of all, Charlie was a planned baby.

12:53.885 --> 12:55.514
What was I?

12:55.524 --> 12:59.633
Well dear, you were a pitcher of
margaritas and a gas station condom.

13:03.022 --> 13:07.183
I had a nice solid stream of urine,
thank you very much.

13:07.189 --> 13:08.155
What?

13:08.181 --> 13:12.202
-My prostate is fine.
-What kind of table talk is that?

13:12.213 --> 13:13.394
You're the one that brought it up!

13:13.399 --> 13:16.986
It doesn't matter who brought it up, I don't
want to hear about it while I'm eating!

13:18.059 --> 13:20.543
You know what,
this lunch was a bad idea...

13:20.569 --> 13:23.693
No, don't say that darling,
it was a wonderful idea.

13:23.694 --> 13:26.518
If I'm being ungracious, I apologize.

13:26.526 --> 13:29.452
Alright, let's call it "ungracious".

13:29.467 --> 13:31.728
Now we all know what we're thinking.

13:32.508 --> 13:35.712
I guess... I'm just a little edgy because...

13:35.723 --> 13:36.829
well...

13:38.979 --> 13:40.067
Never mind.

13:40.068 --> 13:40.933
What?

13:40.935 --> 13:43.995
Forget it, my problems are my problems.

13:44.011 --> 13:45.951
I don't expect you to...

13:46.200 --> 13:47.942
take care of me.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.635
Mom,

13:51.651 --> 13:53.342
just for the sake of argument,

13:53.345 --> 13:57.627
let's say that I wanted
to take care of you, what's going on?

13:57.662 --> 13:59.400
Nothing.

13:59.497 --> 14:02.360
I'm just having a little
minor surgery tomorrow.

14:02.370 --> 14:03.640
What kind of surgery?

14:03.646 --> 14:04.941
It's a woman thing...

14:04.957 --> 14:06.641
Is there anything I can do?

14:06.861 --> 14:09.620
Just keep me in your prayers.

14:10.108 --> 14:11.559
No, no, no...

14:11.572 --> 14:14.954
I will drive you there, and then take you
back to my place so you can recuperate.

14:14.955 --> 14:18.915
Oh sweetheart, that's very generous,
but I don't want to be a burden.

14:18.930 --> 14:20.754
Mom please...

14:20.757 --> 14:23.050
That ship has sailed.

14:23.978 --> 14:26.628
Well then, I accept.

14:26.647 --> 14:28.048
Thank you.

14:31.985 --> 14:34.811
Who buys condoms at a gas station!

14:42.879 --> 14:44.767

14:54.903 --> 14:56.637
Thank you darling.

15:03.985 --> 15:05.251
What happened to your mouth?

15:05.264 --> 15:07.690
I just had a little procedure.

15:08.292 --> 15:09.491
What kind of procedure?

15:09.494 --> 15:13.255
They sucked some fat out of her ass,
and shot it into her lips.

15:16.150 --> 15:18.803
What did they do,
use the whole ass?

15:20.922 --> 15:24.134
They're just a little swollen,
in 2 days they'll be plump,

15:24.139 --> 15:26.758
luscious and ready for action.

15:27.535 --> 15:30.253
What boy doesn't like
hearing that from his mother?

15:31.082 --> 15:33.606
Charlie, I need to sit down.

15:33.611 --> 15:35.059
I got you covered.

15:35.077 --> 15:37.672
I thought you said
it was a woman thing?

15:37.679 --> 15:40.373
You know any guys
dumb enough to do this?

15:42.047 --> 15:43.790
Good Lord!

15:43.791 --> 15:46.518
What did you do,
fellate a bee hive?

15:48.219 --> 15:49.588
Fellate?

15:49.602 --> 15:52.170
I read, I can conjugate.

15:53.296 --> 15:58.558
Man the last time I saw a mouth like that,
it was "tourné Jacques Cousteau."

16:05.178 --> 16:06.611
There you go, Mom.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.890
-Nice bite size pieces.
-Thank you, darling.

16:10.064 --> 16:13.237
Dad says you got your butt in your lips.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.835
Just eat your dinner.

16:19.836 --> 16:20.991
Hang on...

16:20.993 --> 16:24.675
So, if you burp now,
it'd really be a fart, right?

16:29.688 --> 16:30.958
Eat.

16:33.477 --> 16:37.362
Charlie, my donut's too soft.

16:38.864 --> 16:42.759
So Jake, has your mother succeeded
in turning you against me yet?

16:42.775 --> 16:44.075
Mom...

16:44.118 --> 16:46.317
What...
You don't think she talks?

16:46.319 --> 16:48.840
You don't think he listens?
Trust me Alan,

16:48.917 --> 16:53.238
even the mind of a dull child
can be forced in by a malicious parent.

16:53.239 --> 16:55.059
Can we just please change the subject?

16:55.060 --> 16:56.547
Although I must say,

16:56.565 --> 17:01.944
I prefer your mother to that post-pubescent
knucklehead your father replaced her with.

17:01.948 --> 17:03.458
OK, OK, that's it.

17:03.474 --> 17:05.041
What, I changed the subject!

17:05.042 --> 17:06.301
Come on Jake, we're going to the movies.

17:06.303 --> 17:07.344
On a school night?

17:07.345 --> 17:09.501
Why not, you're flunking anyway.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.587
Wait, wait,
you're just leaving me?

17:11.588 --> 17:13.755
You're taking care of Mom, remember?

17:13.768 --> 17:14.912
That's not fair.

17:14.915 --> 17:17.530
You got a complaint?
Take it to the floating head.

17:24.125 --> 17:25.579
So how is work?

17:25.924 --> 17:26.834
Fine.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.693
Are you seeing anybody special?

17:28.706 --> 17:29.799
Nope.

17:31.059 --> 17:33.856
Charlie, did you ever stop to think

17:33.878 --> 17:38.988
that our relationship is strained
because you won't let me, you won't share.

17:38.996 --> 17:40.932
You know why I won't share with you, Mom?

17:40.939 --> 17:43.363
Because anything I say
will be used against me.

17:43.364 --> 17:44.557
Oh please...

17:44.559 --> 17:47.687
I have to go to the bathroom,
maybe I have a prostate problem.

17:47.688 --> 17:51.708
I buy a new Mercedes,
you call it a Nazi phallic symbol.

17:51.974 --> 17:56.715
I'm seeing someone new, you ask if I'm
paying her by the hour, or per schtup!

17:57.313 --> 18:00.242
Charlie, when I say those things,
it's because I want to help you.

18:00.243 --> 18:04.108
You're my son, I want you
to be the best you can be.

18:04.109 --> 18:06.619
I appreciate that,
but you can stop worrying,

18:06.623 --> 18:10.499
I'm doing fine.
I am the best I can be.

18:10.836 --> 18:14.012
Oh darling, that just breaks my heart.

18:23.415 --> 18:25.600
Why would he do this to me?

18:25.685 --> 18:28.034
Take care of your mother...

18:28.406 --> 18:30.511
Not like she ever took care of him.

18:30.587 --> 18:35.179
She nagged him,
humiliated him, emasculated him.

18:35.554 --> 18:39.180
Maybe the reason he died so young
is because he wanted to.

18:39.876 --> 18:43.375
Charlie! My donut's soft again!

18:43.465 --> 18:45.113
Be right there!

18:46.541 --> 18:47.661
Why?

18:47.687 --> 18:50.149
Why do you want me
to take care of her?

18:50.150 --> 18:51.568
Charlie!

18:52.590 --> 18:54.302
I'm coming!

18:54.313 --> 18:57.846
Come on, talk to me!
Give me a sign!

18:57.847 --> 19:01.816
* Marry that cute girl down the beach. *

19:03.139 --> 19:04.035
Rose...

19:04.036 --> 19:06.600
* Yes, that's her name. *

19:08.771 --> 19:09.880
You know what,

19:09.881 --> 19:10.933
you can tell me in person,

19:10.950 --> 19:14.710
because I am this close
to sticking my tongue in a light socket.

19:15.683 --> 19:19.171
* Why don't you stick
your tongue in my mouth instead? *

19:19.723 --> 19:23.122
* I mean, Rose's mouth. *

19:32.030 --> 19:33.046
What are you watching?

19:33.048 --> 19:35.248
Some old gangster movie.

19:37.929 --> 19:39.078
Any good?

19:39.536 --> 19:40.658
Not really.

19:41.424 --> 19:43.074
It just gives me a warm feeling

19:43.078 --> 19:47.590
to know that all those young,
beautiful actors are now dead.

19:49.148 --> 19:51.138
"Dana knows too much."

19:51.194 --> 19:53.241
"You want I should
take care of her, boss?"

19:58.397 --> 20:00.724
"Yeah, take care of her."

20:00.751 --> 20:03.042
"But make it look like an accident."

20:05.471 --> 20:07.237
"Don't worry about a thing."

20:07.249 --> 20:09.039
"I'll take care of her."

20:10.522 --> 20:11.422
Sorry.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.311
I misunderstood.

20:16.052 --> 20:18.026
What's that, dear?

20:18.458 --> 20:19.728
Nothing.

20:34.550 --> 20:35.627
Hi.

20:36.541 --> 20:37.674
Hello.

20:38.550 --> 20:39.894
I don't know if you remember me,

20:39.896 --> 20:42.209
but I'm the one who pulled you out
of the ocean the other day.

20:42.227 --> 20:44.065
Oh, right! Right, right...

20:44.166 --> 20:44.715
Thanks!

20:44.723 --> 20:46.455
It's OK, it's my job.

20:46.636 --> 20:48.791
Well, I'm-I'm... glad you did it!

20:48.898 --> 20:51.855
Anyway, I was just checking in on you,
see how you're doing.

20:51.888 --> 20:52.997
I'm doing fine.

20:53.014 --> 20:54.100
Good...

20:55.298 --> 20:56.478
So...

20:56.655 --> 20:58.574
you want to walk down to the pier?

20:58.592 --> 21:00.786
Maybe grab a cup of coffee...

21:09.037 --> 21:11.293
Gee, I don't know...

21:11.294 --> 21:15.691
Charlie, it's time
to change my butt dressing.

21:18.125 --> 21:19.962
Eh, what the hell,
let's go.
