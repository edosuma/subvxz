WEBVTT

02:25.712 --> 02:27.055
We are on the premises.

02:27.113 --> 02:29.491
We need an alarm reset
from the security company.

02:29.549 --> 02:31.222
WOMAN ON RADIO: Copy that,
Sergeant.

02:32.051 --> 02:34.031
We are going to check the
perimeter of the house.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.058
Notifying the alarm company now.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.660
Dispatch, we have a break-in.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.170
We don't know if there
are suspects inside.

02:40.226 --> 02:41.637
We are entering the premises.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.302
Advise if you need additional.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.053
Oh, man, I recognize that name.

02:59.812 --> 03:01.553
He's a state judge.

03:06.452 --> 03:07.863
Not anymore.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.364
Dispatch, we have an
aggravated homicide.

03:12.425 --> 03:14.530
Special circumstance,
victim is a state official,

03:14.594 --> 03:16.164
Judge Logan Patterson.

03:16.229 --> 03:17.264
Copy that, Sergeant.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.469
Looks like a B and
E gone very wrong.

03:56.536 --> 04:00.006
Damn shame for him to die like
this He was a great judge.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.245
What time did he enter the house?

04:01.307 --> 04:02.342
10:22 p.m.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.853
The alarm went off at 10:13.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.713
Gives us a good estimate
of time of death.

04:05.778 --> 04:07.382
Any witnesses?
Nobody's come forward.

04:07.447 --> 04:10.121
We talked to neighbors on both
sides and across the street.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.184
Nobody heard anything.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.992
Now what about wife? Children?

04:13.152 --> 04:14.927
Anybody live with him?
Judge lived alone.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.594
His wife died three
years ago. No kids.

04:17.724 --> 04:21.297
Found a gun on the floor over here.
We haven't touched it.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.838
Walther .32.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.569
Ran the serial number,
registered to the judge.

04:25.632 --> 04:28.875
He purchased it in 1995.
Had a license to carry it.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.243
You find any casings?

04:30.303 --> 04:32.112
One. Under the chair.

04:33.139 --> 04:34.413
At least he got off one shot.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.314
You find the bullet?

04:36.376 --> 04:38.481
Nothing in the walls
or the ceiling.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.820
Windows are intact,
so unless it went out the door...

04:40.880 --> 04:42.052
Our killer might have been hit.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.185
Any blood trail?

04:43.249 --> 04:45.195
Plenty of blood.
But it's all around the judge.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.857
Well, if our perp took a shot,
he'd need medical attention.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.730
Let's get an APB out to all
the hospitals, clinics.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.703
Also, tap the snitches for any
surgeons working off the grid.

04:53.760 --> 04:54.932
On it.

04:58.264 --> 05:00.301
Unbelievable.

05:01.901 --> 05:03.346
This is going to make
a lot of people angry.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.576
I think it was more than just
a random act of violence.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.777
Yeah, there's a lot easier
way to kill somebody

05:07.840 --> 05:09.478
than to shove a gavel
down his throat.

05:09.542 --> 05:12.853
Patterson was one of
the best judges we had.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.419
I worked a lot of cases
that wound up in his court.

05:15.515 --> 05:18.519
He had over 30 years on the bench.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.791
We requested all of the
judge's case files.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.191
Start with the most recent,

05:22.255 --> 05:23.996
see if there were any
registered threats.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.003
I'm sure he made a lot of
enemies in all those years.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.705
Sir, we have a print off the gavel.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.232
Let's find out who it belongs to.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.004
Any luck? Nah.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.733
Nothing to write home about yet.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.835
We've been doing a cross-check
on the judge's cases

06:07.900 --> 06:09.811
against any recent parolees.

06:09.969 --> 06:12.677
So far we've got three released
in the last six months.

06:13.606 --> 06:15.711
Lester Cambridge,
paroled from Powder River.

06:15.775 --> 06:18.415
Scott Teller, released
from Santiam six weeks ago

06:18.478 --> 06:20.549
and Jamal Shutter,
just got out of Eastern.

06:20.613 --> 06:21.887
Any of them back here in Portland?

06:21.948 --> 06:23.018
All three of them.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.117
Nick's checking alibis.

06:27.086 --> 06:28.326
Griffin.

06:30.289 --> 06:31.768
I'm at my computer.
Send it through.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.061
Thanks.

06:33.493 --> 06:35.973
Got an ID on the print
from the judge's house.

06:36.028 --> 06:37.268
A match from the Navy.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.365
One of your parolees?

06:38.431 --> 06:39.535
Nope.

06:39.699 --> 06:42.680
Name's Vince Chilton.
Got no record at all.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.045
See if you can get a match
on a driver's license.

06:46.205 --> 06:47.445
Renewed it two months ago.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.247
Got an address here in Portland.

06:49.308 --> 06:51.049
All right, let's go.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.652
Go, go, go.

06:59.986 --> 07:02.193
Portland Police! Go, go, go!

07:02.355 --> 07:03.766
Go, go, go.

07:04.991 --> 07:06.265
Kitchen, clear!

07:06.793 --> 07:07.965
Bedroom, clear!

07:09.495 --> 07:11.031
We're clear.

07:11.631 --> 07:12.632
We're clear.

07:12.698 --> 07:14.735
We secured the premises but
you got a body in there.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.640
Phew! Man.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.145
Vince Chilton?

07:26.245 --> 07:27.918
Umm... Looks like.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.189
Which hand did the
fingerprint come from?

07:31.250 --> 07:32.320
The one he doesn't have.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.029
So our killer needed a helping hand,
he got it from Chilton.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.569
Yeah, he wanted us to find him.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.104
Means our killer is
connected to both of them.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.099
Woman's watch.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.766
Wearing it back side out.

07:44.931 --> 07:47.411
It looks pretty old. Antique maybe.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.169
Doesn't seem like Chilton
would be the kind of guy

07:49.235 --> 07:51.146
interested in women's
antique watches, huh?

07:51.237 --> 07:52.545
It's engraved.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.778
"To Mary, Love, Mom." Huh.

07:54.841 --> 07:55.945
It's definitely not Chilton's.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.348
Yeah, we got to find Mary.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.855
Let's hope Mary's not
connected to this.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.719
Maybe we can trace the watch.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.055
You know, Nick knows a watch guy.

08:12.525 --> 08:14.095
This is awful early.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.969
Can you trace an antique watch?

08:16.028 --> 08:18.770
Wow. You're actually
calling me for what I do?

08:19.098 --> 08:20.441
Might have to charge you for this.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.343
Yeah, we found one
on a murder victim.

08:22.401 --> 08:23.402
I'm with my partner.

08:23.469 --> 08:24.470
We're coming over.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.210
I get it. Be cool.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.008
Wear pants.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.516
Good morning.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.818
Well, not that good if
somebody died, I guess,

08:33.880 --> 08:36.292
but, yeah, come on in.

08:40.753 --> 08:41.754
Thanks for helping us out.

08:41.821 --> 08:42.856
Not a problem.

08:42.922 --> 08:45.960
I like to help the
police whenever I can.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.867
This is the watch we need to trace.

08:48.828 --> 08:51.274
Vintage Lusina. Very nice.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.609
I'm going to have to get in
there and check a few details.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.540
You mind if I...
Forensics cleared it.

08:56.802 --> 08:58.076
Go ahead.

08:58.671 --> 08:59.672
Okay.

08:59.939 --> 09:03.386
Valjoux movement, 72 C to be exact.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.147
Triple calendar.

09:05.978 --> 09:08.788
Wow. Just pure beauty.

09:09.815 --> 09:11.556
Here. Check it out.

09:12.184 --> 09:13.424
Triple complications.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.092
That's day, date,
month to the layman.

09:16.622 --> 09:17.828
Probably made in the '30s.

09:17.890 --> 09:18.891
What about the engraving?

09:19.158 --> 09:20.193
Professional.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.863
Could have been done by any engraver,
anytime, anywhere.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.745
Oh, this is tragic.

09:30.803 --> 09:31.804
What?

09:31.871 --> 09:34.408
Some jerk put glue in the movement.

09:35.341 --> 09:37.617
This watch is destroyed.
I want to weep.

09:37.677 --> 09:38.849
Why would somebody do that?

09:38.911 --> 09:40.117
To stop it from working.

09:40.179 --> 09:42.659
Maybe they wanted to stop it
on a specific time and date.

09:42.715 --> 09:45.218
Glue would certainly
guarantee that.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.022
10:15, March 11th.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.760
Any way you can tell
us who the owner is?

09:49.822 --> 09:52.769
Original movement number, maybe.
Or a service mark.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.772
I'll make some calls. Whoever serviced
this will definitely remember it.

09:55.828 --> 09:56.863
How long would that take?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.840
A couple of minutes if
they got the paperwork.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.536
There's coffee in the kitchen.
Help yourselves.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.307
Nick, you know where it is.

10:04.637 --> 10:07.777
From the time you guys
both searched my house.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.346
Remember?

10:09.408 --> 10:10.478
I mean, if you don't remember,

10:10.543 --> 10:11.647
it's right down that hall there.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.189
Yeah. I think I remember.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.889
Just right in the kitchen there.

10:24.590 --> 10:25.967
He's a little weird, isn't he?

10:26.058 --> 10:27.662
He spends his life fixing clocks.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.899
I wonder where he
keeps his coffee cups.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.375
You think March 11th has something
to do with Vince Chilton?

10:33.432 --> 10:34.877
Maybe. Or the judge.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.470
What about Mary,
the name on the watch?

10:36.702 --> 10:39.080
Maybe March 11th connects all
three of them together somehow.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.445
Maybe all four of them,
killer included.

10:42.508 --> 10:43.782
But March 11th of what year?

10:43.843 --> 10:46.346
Maybe we're looking at some
kind of Zodiac killer here.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.449
Hey, I got something, actually.

10:49.348 --> 10:54.627
Turns out the watch was first purchased
in 1933 by a Steven Armstrong.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.860
He gave it to his wife as
a wedding present. She...

10:56.922 --> 10:58.629
1933? Who owns it now?

10:58.691 --> 10:59.692
Yeah, man, I got the whole history.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.365
And that's great, really,
but we just need to know who owns it now.

11:02.928 --> 11:05.204
Oh, I get it. Okay.

11:05.264 --> 11:06.743
Just the facts, right? Okay.

11:06.799 --> 11:10.576
Let's see. The watch was serviced
last here in Portland, actually,

11:10.636 --> 11:13.082
two months ago for a Mary Robinson.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.213
Mary Robinson? You know her?

11:15.274 --> 11:17.345
If it's the same
Mary Robinson, I do.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.890
Assistant D.A.
Retired about a year ago.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.481
I worked a lot of cases with her.

11:23.115 --> 11:24.617
I got a bad feeling about this.

11:27.586 --> 11:28.792
Thanks.

11:29.555 --> 11:30.761
Anytime.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.299
Come on, let's go.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.011
You find her?

11:41.400 --> 11:42.936
Found her body.

11:58.484 --> 12:02.057
Killer cut out her tongue
and put it on the scale.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.330
What's the message this time?

12:07.626 --> 12:08.661
Scales of justice?

12:08.728 --> 12:09.763
No.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.438
She's the message.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.579
Mary Robinson herself.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.153
I know who the killer is.

12:31.450 --> 12:33.657
It was a triple
homicide five years ago.

12:33.719 --> 12:35.960
Jack Lambert, his wife and
seven-year-old daughter

12:36.021 --> 12:37.523
were abducted from their home

12:37.590 --> 12:39.627
and taken to an abandoned
quarry near Tigard

12:39.692 --> 12:41.000
and tortured for two days.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.164
I'll never forget the crime scene.

12:42.228 --> 12:43.832
Yeah, I remember the case.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.341
Oleg Stark was a contract killer.

12:45.397 --> 12:48.139
He was suspected of murders in Illinois,
Kansas and Colorado.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.770
But this time it was personal.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.872
Jack Lambert was a business
associate of Stark's

12:51.937 --> 12:54.315
who knew that Stark
demanded to be paid in gold.

12:54.373 --> 12:57.513
Apparently Jack found out where
Stark stashed his gold and stole it.

12:57.576 --> 12:58.714
It was a revenge killing.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.950
That's why he got sloppy.

13:00.012 --> 13:01.047
He was angry.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.354
All the other people he killed,
he didn't give a damn about.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.152
Stark left a gold coin behind,

13:05.217 --> 13:06.821
that's how I knew it was him.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.092
He was tried here in Portland,

13:08.154 --> 13:10.464
but sentenced to a California
ADX facility in Pelican Bay.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.558
How'd he get out?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.069
24 hours ago, Stark escaped.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.162
He was on medical transfer
when he got his chance.

13:15.227 --> 13:17.605
Broke the doctor's legs and
beat two guards into a coma.

13:17.663 --> 13:19.438
Why didn't we know
that Stark escaped?

13:19.498 --> 13:21.739
Bulletin hit California
state agency first.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.041
They thought they had him trapped,

13:23.102 --> 13:25.241
so they didn't go wide with
it until he was long gone.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.306
Now this is from Stark's
medical records.

13:27.373 --> 13:30.013
"Convict displays signs
of congenital analgesia,

13:30.075 --> 13:32.282
"a rare genetic disorder which
deadens the nerve endings,

13:32.344 --> 13:34.051
"making it difficult
to process pain.

13:34.113 --> 13:37.959
"In addition, Stark's bone structure
appears abnormally dense."

13:38.017 --> 13:40.725
Which basically makes this guy
very unpleasant to deal with.

13:40.786 --> 13:42.697
So what's Stark's connection
to Judge Patterson,

13:42.755 --> 13:44.291
Vince Chilton and Mary Robinson?

13:44.356 --> 13:45.733
Judge presided over the trial.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.361
Mary Robinson prosecuted the case,

13:47.526 --> 13:50.507
Vince Chilton was the jury foreman
who handed the verdict to the judge.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.467
Remember the time and
date on the watch?

13:52.531 --> 13:54.204
10:15, March 11th.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.609
That was the moment Stark was
sentenced to 300 years in prison.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.775
I knew it was something,
but I didn't put it together

13:59.839 --> 14:01.318
until I saw Mary Robinson's body.

14:01.373 --> 14:04.786
That would mean, as the arresting officer,
he's coming after you next.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.118
I'm going to take
this bastard down.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.247
No. No. No, you're going
into protective custody.

14:08.781 --> 14:09.816
I'm not running.

14:09.882 --> 14:10.986
He's already killed three people.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.051
I'm not about to lose a cop.

14:12.117 --> 14:13.425
He's killed a lot more than that.

14:13.485 --> 14:15.158
I'm not going to risk it.
Neither are you.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.930
I understand why you want to get him.
I feel the same way.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.696
But protective custody,
that's my call. Not yours.

14:22.061 --> 14:24.871
When Stark escaped,
he had to move fast.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.376
We need to check for stolen vehicles,
assaults and B and Es

14:27.433 --> 14:28.639
from here to the state line.

14:30.302 --> 14:31.645
Then get on it.

14:40.913 --> 14:44.190
You know this guy's been shot three
times and stabbed twice, right?

14:44.516 --> 14:46.393
Yeah, I know.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.897
Hank, the Captain's just doing
what he thinks is right.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.801
What's right for him
is not right for me.

14:56.862 --> 14:59.843
Give us 24 hours,
see if we can't get it done.

15:00.499 --> 15:02.308
I think I got what
you're looking for.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.574
68-year-old man
reported his car stolen

15:05.638 --> 15:08.175
from a rest stop on I-5,
near the California border.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.016
The perp, fitting Stark's
description, drove off

15:11.076 --> 15:15.547
in his blue '92 Cadillac Coupe de Ville,
license plate 8-0-7-I-H-O.

15:15.614 --> 15:18.561
Hmm. If that Caddy's in
Portland we'll find it.

15:57.389 --> 15:58.561
Hey, lady!

16:00.626 --> 16:01.627
What are you doing?

16:01.694 --> 16:03.002
Helping you cross the street.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.906
Oh, thank you, young man,
you're very kind.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.017
Nothing. Let's go.

16:20.779 --> 16:23.760
So, what do you know about Stark?

16:24.183 --> 16:25.594
What do you mean? Where is he from?

16:25.851 --> 16:27.330
Does he have any family?

16:27.386 --> 16:28.888
Maybe we can get ahead of this guy.

16:29.088 --> 16:30.624
You know, that was one of
the weird things about him.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.032
He didn't seem to
be from any place.

16:32.458 --> 16:35.064
No record of where he was born.
No record of a family.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.164
It's like this guy just
fell out of the sky.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.368
Found the Caddy.
Or what's left of it.

16:39.431 --> 16:41.775
Blown up in a parking lot across
from the city rec facility.

16:41.834 --> 16:42.835
Twentieth and Belmont.

16:43.702 --> 16:46.342
Wait a minute. Isn't
that near your old place?

16:46.638 --> 16:49.448
I lived a block away when
I worked Stark's case.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.749
I guess this is my wakeup call.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.119
Hank, you're not going
anywhere. Captain!

16:54.179 --> 16:56.216
Right now, the safest place for
you is here at the precinct.

16:57.082 --> 16:58.356
Let's go.

17:14.465 --> 17:15.501
Any witnesses?

17:15.567 --> 17:17.410
FIRE CAPTAIN: We had some people
on scene when we got here.

17:17.469 --> 17:18.811
Quite a few of them in the park.

17:18.904 --> 17:20.041
Nobody said anything to us.

17:20.105 --> 17:21.482
You make a determination
on the cause?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.645
It's obviously somebody
meant to do this.

17:23.709 --> 17:24.743
No attempt to hide it.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.917
Opened gas tank,
stuffed something inside,

17:28.313 --> 17:30.589
lit a match, walked away.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.059
Plates on the Caddy are a match
for the one that was stolen.

17:33.252 --> 17:34.356
Then it's Stark.

17:34.853 --> 17:35.991
Thank you.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.090
FIRE CAPTAIN: Need
anything else, let us know.

17:37.156 --> 17:38.157
Sure.

17:55.007 --> 17:59.387
Congenital analgesia,
abnormally dense bones.

19:24.663 --> 19:25.835
Honey?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.279
Juliette?

19:38.210 --> 19:39.951
Hey. Where are you?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.787
Hey, on my way home
with fresh ravioli.

19:41.847 --> 19:42.848
Where are you?

19:42.915 --> 19:43.916
Oh, I'm in the kitchen.

19:43.982 --> 19:46.428
Good. Boil the water on the stove.
I'll be right there.

19:46.485 --> 19:47.725
Will do.

20:08.674 --> 20:10.745
Damn raccoons.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.039
Where is he?

20:42.841 --> 20:44.115
Where is he?

21:00.525 --> 21:01.936
Where is he?

21:14.706 --> 21:15.878
Grimm.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.870
Nick!

21:36.628 --> 21:37.902
Run! Run!

22:00.886 --> 22:01.990
Nick.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.164
Call Hank.

22:04.456 --> 22:06.026
You have to call Hank.

22:07.959 --> 22:11.031
He has three bruised ribs
and a dislocated shoulder

22:11.096 --> 22:12.871
to go along with a mild concussion.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.211
Nothing broken, however.
He's very lucky.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.843
Thank you.

22:18.036 --> 22:19.777
I'll get units posted
here at the hospital

22:19.838 --> 22:22.114
and outside your house
around the clock.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.518
And I'll have an
escort take you home.

22:24.576 --> 22:26.112
This guy won't get anywhere
near you, I promise.

22:27.579 --> 22:28.580
You know who did this?

22:28.647 --> 22:29.682
Yeah.

22:29.881 --> 22:32.020
I've got every cop in the
city looking for him.

22:32.484 --> 22:35.795
Trust me, he'll pay
for what he's done.

22:45.931 --> 22:47.535
Juliette.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.174
Hey.

22:53.939 --> 22:55.009
Hey.

22:56.408 --> 22:58.115
Where's my ravioli?

22:58.176 --> 23:00.417
I spilled the water.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.381
Yeah, you did.

23:04.316 --> 23:05.989
You probably saved my life.

23:13.992 --> 23:15.232
I'm sorry.

23:16.261 --> 23:17.831
It's not your fault.

23:17.896 --> 23:20.103
I'm so sorry, Juliette. It is.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.272
It happened in our house...

23:26.605 --> 23:27.879
With you.

23:28.673 --> 23:30.983
I'll be fine. So will the house.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.487
Nick, you need to rest.

23:38.984 --> 23:40.827
I love you so much.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.029
I love you, too.

23:48.794 --> 23:51.775
Go to sleep. I'll be
back in the morning.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.261
Hey! I'm actually glad you called.

24:20.325 --> 24:22.828
I found out a whole bunch more
information about that watch.

24:22.894 --> 24:24.430
Yeah, it was...

24:26.765 --> 24:27.869
What?

24:30.602 --> 24:31.706
What?

24:38.310 --> 24:39.755
Would you like me to
stay inside with you?

24:39.811 --> 24:43.486
No, no. I'm... I'm fine.
I have a lot to do.

24:45.016 --> 24:46.825
Well, we'll be right outside.

24:47.018 --> 24:51.091
We'll have two cars. One on each
street with all entrances covered.

24:52.290 --> 24:53.792
Good night.

24:55.861 --> 24:56.931
Run!

25:32.163 --> 25:33.870
Stark went after Nick at his house.

25:33.932 --> 25:36.173
He must have followed him home
some time after he blew up the car.

25:36.234 --> 25:38.271
He was probably watching the
whole thing waiting for me.

25:38.336 --> 25:39.679
When I didn't show,
he took my partner.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.411
Yeah, that's kind of
what we were thinking.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.381
Was Juliette there? Yeah,
for part of it.

25:43.441 --> 25:45.011
Good thing, too.
If she hadn't come home...

25:45.777 --> 25:46.778
Who knows.

25:46.845 --> 25:47.846
Is she okay?

25:48.113 --> 25:49.114
She didn't get hurt.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.823
That son of a bitch.

25:57.088 --> 25:58.294
Hank.

25:58.356 --> 25:59.357
I'm going to see Nick.

25:59.424 --> 26:00.528
Hank. He's going to be fine.

26:00.592 --> 26:02.401
You can't do him
any good right now.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.269
I'm not staying here.

26:05.430 --> 26:06.773
This is my responsibility.

26:06.831 --> 26:09.641
The safety of my men
is my responsibility.

26:09.801 --> 26:11.075
Look, I want to get
Stark as much as you do,

26:11.136 --> 26:12.547
but I'm not going to lose
another man doing it.

26:12.871 --> 26:15.112
He won't stop until he gets me.

26:15.540 --> 26:18.487
The only way nobody else gets
hurt is if I do this alone.

26:18.543 --> 26:19.988
What if he just
thinks you're alone?

26:20.545 --> 26:21.717
What are you talking about?

26:21.780 --> 26:24.226
Set a trap. With you as bait.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.417
HOW?

26:25.483 --> 26:30.091
Roadblocks, spike strips, SWAT units all
around. Pick a place we can control.

26:30.155 --> 26:31.793
Ridge Crest Pass.

26:31.990 --> 26:35.836
Two-lane road, one way in,
one way out. Could work.

26:36.061 --> 26:37.233
But I'll have to get him there.

26:37.295 --> 26:39.536
Stark attacked Nick for a reason.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.906
Not to kill him,
but to draw you out.

26:41.967 --> 26:43.139
He knows you're
going to go see him.

26:43.201 --> 26:44.305
Okay.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.680
Then we'll let him
think it's worked.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.150
Like I said, I'm going to see Nick.

27:09.094 --> 27:10.300
Where is he?

27:15.233 --> 27:16.735
I don't know what you
were just dreaming about

27:16.801 --> 27:18.075
but it couldn't have been good.

27:19.104 --> 27:20.879
Who did this to you?

27:21.039 --> 27:22.416
He was big.

27:23.441 --> 27:26.149
And he has a rare genetic disorder

27:27.345 --> 27:29.450
that would deaden the nerves

27:29.948 --> 27:32.724
and abnormally dense bones.

27:32.784 --> 27:33.819
Siegbarste.

27:35.053 --> 27:36.361
Your basic ogre.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.060
You're saying you saw
one here in Portland?

27:40.125 --> 27:41.195
Yeah.

27:41.259 --> 27:44.570
Oh, man. I just got a
knot in my stomach.

27:45.897 --> 27:47.240
Siegbarstes are the worst.

27:47.298 --> 27:48.868
I mean, fortunately,
they're very rare,

27:48.933 --> 27:50.606
but if you ever run across one...

27:51.803 --> 27:53.714
Well, I guess you have.

27:53.805 --> 27:54.943
You've dealt with one before?

27:55.006 --> 27:56.508
Yeah. When I was a kid.

27:56.574 --> 27:57.848
I mean, I didn't deal
with him directly.

27:57.909 --> 28:00.048
He came after a neighbor of mine,
two doors down.

28:00.111 --> 28:02.057
Their son Freddy was
a buddy of mine.

28:02.113 --> 28:05.219
This guy beat Freddy's dad
to death in his own garage.

28:05.283 --> 28:07.820
And then used his tools to,
you know.

28:08.887 --> 28:12.391
Trust me, you're lucky to be alive.

28:12.624 --> 28:13.762
He's after Hank.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.196
Hank? Why?

28:16.327 --> 28:17.635
He put him in prison.

28:17.762 --> 28:19.742
Oh, yeah, that'll do it.

28:19.931 --> 28:23.208
These guys carry
grudges to the grave.

28:24.269 --> 28:25.805
And usually it's your grave.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.076
I have to stop him.

28:27.138 --> 28:28.913
Good luck with that.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.411
Look at you. He already put
you in the hospital, man.

28:31.476 --> 28:33.615
Siegbarstes are hard to kill.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.589
Not only do they have
really dense bones,

28:35.647 --> 28:38.526
they have thick skin and body
odor that could stop a train.

28:38.583 --> 28:39.857
They're not immortal.

28:39.918 --> 28:44.060
No, they're not immortal,
but in order to take one down,

28:44.122 --> 28:45.965
you got to get close
enough to do it

28:46.024 --> 28:48.368
before they knock your block off.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.967
Unless of course,
you have some Siegbarste Gift.

28:51.029 --> 28:52.474
What? Gift.

28:53.364 --> 28:54.570
German word for poison,

28:54.632 --> 28:56.737
which I always found kind of
weird at Christmas, but...

28:57.102 --> 28:58.979
That stuff is so rare.

28:59.070 --> 29:02.142
I mean you could search your
entire life and never find any.

29:02.207 --> 29:04.448
It literally grows on
the north side of trees

29:04.509 --> 29:07.285
just below the timber line
in Romania or something.

29:07.445 --> 29:08.515
I think I have some.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.856
What kind of meds
they got you on, man?

29:10.982 --> 29:12.017
From my aunt.

29:12.917 --> 29:13.952
Oh.

29:14.452 --> 29:15.487
What's it do?

29:15.553 --> 29:17.157
Calcifies their bones.

29:17.655 --> 29:20.966
So you sort of shatter the
ogre from the inside out.

29:21.459 --> 29:22.836
The trick is getting
the poison in them.

29:23.128 --> 29:24.436
I think I know how to do that.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.702
There's a rifle.

29:29.734 --> 29:30.769
It's made for it.

29:32.403 --> 29:34.110
I need you to get it for me.

29:34.439 --> 29:35.543
Um...

29:37.475 --> 29:38.579
Okay.

29:38.943 --> 29:41.480
He said somewhat tenuously.

29:43.748 --> 29:45.318
All right, there's a trailer.

30:26.157 --> 30:27.727
Oh, man.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.903
Dad?

30:37.268 --> 30:40.078
I swear to God,
I'm doing the right thing.

30:40.572 --> 30:41.676
Okay.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.142
Where is this?

30:44.809 --> 30:46.482
Siegbarste. Siegbarste

30:47.245 --> 30:48.918
Oh, that's not it.

30:49.747 --> 30:51.249
That's not it.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.155
Ah!

30:58.022 --> 30:59.524
There you are.

31:07.165 --> 31:08.235
Ooh!

31:11.936 --> 31:14.746
That's going to stick
with me for awhile.

31:17.942 --> 31:19.478
Okay, big cabinet.

31:24.983 --> 31:28.021
This is awesome.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.110
This is a total freak show.

32:07.725 --> 32:09.705
Oh. This is a big rifle.

32:17.502 --> 32:19.413
Big rifle, big bullets.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.267
Ooh!

33:17.862 --> 33:19.535
I don't even know where to start.

33:19.630 --> 33:22.509
You can start by telling me
what the hell you're doing here.

33:22.567 --> 33:24.274
You're supposed to be on lockdown.

33:24.335 --> 33:25.678
Didn't work out.

33:28.973 --> 33:30.179
How you doing?

33:30.408 --> 33:32.820
It would make me feel
a hell of a lot better

33:32.877 --> 33:33.947
if you were back at the precinct.

33:34.212 --> 33:36.920
It's all right,
we're bringing Stark in.

33:38.349 --> 33:39.419
HOW?

33:39.684 --> 33:42.255
Just throwing out a little bait.

33:42.653 --> 33:44.599
I think I know how we
can bring this guy down.

33:44.655 --> 33:46.066
Captain's already got a plan.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.830
I'm supposed to lead Stark to a
road block out on Ridge Crest.

33:49.827 --> 33:52.967
Everyone will be there waiting
for him and it's done.

33:53.398 --> 33:54.604
Simple.

33:54.832 --> 33:57.142
Hank, listen to me.

33:59.337 --> 34:00.611
This guy.

34:01.939 --> 34:02.974
He's not normal.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.652
I know what I'm doing.

34:07.111 --> 34:08.784
But there's something
you don't know.

34:10.313 --> 34:12.920
During Stark's trial,
I did something.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.360
He had a good lawyer.

34:17.088 --> 34:18.623
All the jury needed
was reasonable doubt

34:18.688 --> 34:21.135
and that monster was going to walk.

34:23.194 --> 34:25.731
I followed through on a lead,

34:25.830 --> 34:29.277
a surveillance tape from a
fast food joint across town.

34:30.902 --> 34:34.940
The guy looked just enough like
Stark to maybe give him an alibi.

34:36.340 --> 34:37.819
It was bogus.

34:38.509 --> 34:40.716
Stark planted the guy himself.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.148
If one juror decided it was Stark,

34:43.214 --> 34:45.820
the whole case would
have been tossed.

34:48.453 --> 34:50.558
I couldn't let that happen.

34:52.857 --> 34:54.268
And neither could Mary Robinson.

34:54.324 --> 34:56.134
And you lost the tape.

34:56.194 --> 34:59.732
It somehow got misplaced on
the way to the D.A.'s office.

35:03.468 --> 35:06.312
Neither of us ever spoke
anything about it.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.109
But now you know, too.

35:13.544 --> 35:15.751
I'm the last one Stark blames,

35:15.847 --> 35:17.884
so I'm going to end
it where it started.

35:18.349 --> 35:20.795
Then you're going to the
quarry instead of Ridge Crest.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.229
At least no one else will get hurt.

35:22.286 --> 35:25.062
So if anyone asks, you can say
you tried to stop me, all right?

35:25.123 --> 35:26.602
Hank. Hank!

35:34.432 --> 35:35.672
Hey, Nick.

35:35.733 --> 35:37.770
Whoa, whoa, man, slow down.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.446
Yeah, I'm bringing you
the gun right now.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.743
What do you mean,
"Hank's leaving the hospital"?

35:43.207 --> 35:46.154
Oh, yeah. Hank's
leaving the hospital.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.223
Looks like he's going to his car.

35:49.313 --> 35:50.724
You want me to give him the gun?

35:50.781 --> 35:52.351
Does he even know about the gun?

35:52.416 --> 35:54.760
If he doesn't know about
the gun, I'm not...

35:55.086 --> 35:58.898
He's already leaving, how am I
supposed to give him the gun now?

35:59.056 --> 36:01.036
All right, okay. All right.
I'll do my best.

37:04.822 --> 37:06.961
What am I supposed to do now?

37:38.055 --> 37:40.501
Stark! You are under arrest!

37:40.558 --> 37:43.767
Place your hands behind your head,
face down on the ground.

37:44.395 --> 37:46.534
Really like the place you picked.

37:46.897 --> 37:48.501
A lot of fond memories here.

37:48.733 --> 37:51.179
Shut up and get down!

37:51.502 --> 37:53.311
Do you hear me?

37:53.638 --> 37:54.878
Oh, man.

37:59.477 --> 38:01.354
You owe me five years!

38:01.679 --> 38:04.990
I'm going to say this one last time.
Get down on the ground!

38:05.216 --> 38:07.218
Let's get this over with.

38:07.485 --> 38:08.657
Stay where you are.

38:11.722 --> 38:13.463
Stay where you are!

38:27.238 --> 38:28.478
Oh, man.

38:33.244 --> 38:34.484
Come on.

39:42.313 --> 39:43.553
Oh, wow.

39:43.814 --> 39:46.556
Okay, time to go. Time to go.

40:00.030 --> 40:02.067
This is Detective Griffin.

40:03.701 --> 40:07.012
I want to report a shooting.

40:34.698 --> 40:36.041
It's done.

40:36.934 --> 40:38.413
Hank is okay.

40:39.537 --> 40:40.572
Me?

40:41.639 --> 40:42.982
I'll live.

40:43.874 --> 40:45.547
Yep. I'll see you.

40:50.915 --> 40:52.121
Stark is dead.

40:54.919 --> 40:55.954
You killed him?

40:56.086 --> 40:58.123
Somebody did, but it wasn't me.

40:59.156 --> 41:00.226
Who?

41:01.358 --> 41:02.860
I wish I knew.

41:03.961 --> 41:04.962
I owe him one.

41:14.171 --> 41:15.980
I'm glad you're okay.

41:18.042 --> 41:19.316
You, too.

41:31.222 --> 41:33.202
You're lucky to be alive.

41:33.791 --> 41:36.362
Pulling a stunt like that,
I should have your badge.

41:36.427 --> 41:38.737
If you want it, you can have it.

41:40.130 --> 41:42.872
I'd rather have you
alive and wearing it.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.977
Look, don't get me wrong.
I wanted Stark dead, too.

41:46.036 --> 41:47.572
But that's not the way
this department works.

41:48.205 --> 41:49.616
You insulted every cop in this city

41:49.673 --> 41:51.846
and we had just as much right
to be there as you did.

41:52.209 --> 41:53.313
Okay.

41:54.278 --> 41:55.382
I get it.

41:55.679 --> 41:57.556
You're a good detective, Hank,

41:57.615 --> 42:01.085
but you're a lot better when
we're all working together.

42:02.686 --> 42:03.960
Now these

42:05.256 --> 42:08.066
are the bullets pulled
out of Stark's body.

42:08.325 --> 42:10.271
According to ballistics,

42:10.327 --> 42:15.037
one 577 and two 600 caliber
nitro-express rifle bullets,

42:15.099 --> 42:17.602
made in England over
one hundred years ago.

42:19.003 --> 42:20.311
What kind of rifle is that?

42:20.504 --> 42:21.915
Triple barrel.

42:21.972 --> 42:23.007
Very rare.

42:23.307 --> 42:25.480
Made mostly for royalty
for their African safaris.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.080
Commonly known as an elephant gun.

42:30.648 --> 42:32.821
Who the hell would
have a gun like that?

42:32.950 --> 42:35.123
That is something I'd
very much like to know.
