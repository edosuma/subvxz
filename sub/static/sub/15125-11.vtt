WEBVTT

00:02.703 --> 00:03.871
You take that back!

00:03.904 --> 00:05.173
I will not!
Not after what you said

00:05.206 --> 00:06.707
about me in front
of the manager.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.076
Well, you deserved it!

00:08.109 --> 00:09.743
Especially after
what you wrote

00:09.777 --> 00:11.912
about me in my peer evaluation.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.013
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, ladies!

00:13.047 --> 00:14.182
Back off.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.583
She had the nerve

00:15.616 --> 00:16.684
to tell the manager that I was

00:16.717 --> 00:17.985
the best damn maid

00:18.018 --> 00:19.720
who ever worked
for Knock Knock Knock.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.689
Well, she deserves
that promotion.

00:21.722 --> 00:25.093
How dare you lie
to make me look good!

00:25.126 --> 00:27.161
I thought we were friends.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.662
Besides, you've
worked here longer.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.398
You should get the promotion!

00:30.431 --> 00:33.434
You know I need to concentrate
on rewriting my telenovela.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.936
It's about a sexy maid
who is constantly fending off

00:35.969 --> 00:38.239
the advances of her blond
coworker's husband

00:38.272 --> 00:41.209
who can't keep his rough
gardener hands off her.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.013
I'm not saying
you should take it.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.381
I'm saying you should
think about it.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.350
Uh, I don't want
to take the job, Burt.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.519
Crew chief has to take
to take crap from everyone.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.588
The boss, your coworkers,
the customers.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.857
And you know taking crap
pisses me off.

00:56.890 --> 00:57.958
You just need to relax.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.059
Close your eyes,

00:59.093 --> 01:00.228
take a deep breath,

01:00.261 --> 01:01.462
and think about
a special place.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.197
I'm not going
to some fantasy place.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.898
I've told you
a million times.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.401
I handle my own stressful
situations my own way.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.370
Did you see
what I just saw?

01:09.403 --> 01:11.839
(mumbles)

01:13.274 --> 01:16.710
Delilah's back.

01:16.744 --> 01:17.745
Surprise!

01:17.778 --> 01:20.614
The rivalry between my mom

01:20.648 --> 01:22.116
and her cousin Delilah
started years ago.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.251
when Maw Maw let
Delilah treat Mom

01:23.284 --> 01:25.085
like a servant.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.287
For years, Delilah took
full advantage.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.821
You're stupid.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.957
And I hate you.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.660
Until my mom
finally had enough...
Ginny!

01:32.693 --> 01:34.662
...and figured out
how to stop her visits.
Maw Maw's dead.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.031
Ghost!

01:38.966 --> 01:40.468
I cast you out,

01:40.501 --> 01:42.136
foul spirit!

01:42.170 --> 01:43.604
(moaning)

01:44.505 --> 01:47.175
No? Not buying it?

01:47.208 --> 01:49.109
Whoo!

01:49.143 --> 01:50.411
* Here we go

01:50.444 --> 01:53.547
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:57.017 --> 01:58.619
I can't believe you two.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.155
Keeping me from my beloved
Delilah just so you two can

02:01.189 --> 02:03.991
keep living in my house,
just leeching off of me.

02:04.024 --> 02:07.361
Yes, we live in your house.
Yes, we leech off you.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.297
Yes, I thought I would come up
with an excuse

02:09.330 --> 02:10.931
so it would make this
all seem okay

02:10.964 --> 02:13.467
by the end of this sentence,
but, no, I have not.

02:13.501 --> 02:17.305
Maw Maw, we do not leech off
of you. We take care of you.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.007
We even got you one of those
custom necklaces so people know

02:20.040 --> 02:22.009
who to call when
you get lost.

02:22.042 --> 02:24.178
Considering what you two did,
it's a miracle

02:24.212 --> 02:25.646
Maw Maw even found me.

02:25.679 --> 02:26.980
I read the wrong number
in my address book,

02:27.014 --> 02:28.849
and I called Delilah

02:28.882 --> 02:30.318
instead of Dr. Delaney,

02:30.351 --> 02:32.052
the euthanasianist.

02:32.085 --> 02:35.323
Sometimes I get a pretty
serious case of the Mondays.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.890
Well, not anymore, Maw Maw,
'cause you got

02:36.924 --> 02:38.626
a new light
in your life.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.561
Unlike the darkness
you've been living with.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.630
Things must not be
that sunny in Florida

02:42.663 --> 02:44.965
if you could just pick up and
come all the way to Natesville.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.700
Actually,
they've been pretty good.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.069
I've opened up a chain
of solar-powered tanning beds

02:49.102 --> 02:50.804
called "Sun Tan."

02:50.838 --> 02:54.141
What we do is we harness the
power of the sun to tan people.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.810
Damn. I got to hand it to her.
That's pretty revolutionary.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.380
Well, Delilah,
it's been nice catching up,

02:59.413 --> 03:00.914
but you probably want
to beat the traffic

03:00.948 --> 03:03.317
getting back
to the Hell Away from Us.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.353
Oh. (chuckles)
I'm not leaving.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.588
At least not
until I help Maw Maw

03:07.621 --> 03:11.859
finalize the details
of her reverse mortgage.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.094
Reverse mortgage.
So that would be what?

03:14.127 --> 03:15.696
E-gag-trom?

03:15.729 --> 03:17.931
Oh, Burt.
(grunts)

03:17.965 --> 03:19.867
You handsome simpleton you.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.336
A reverse mortgage is a
financially sound way

03:22.370 --> 03:24.405
for Maw Maw to get money
out of her house now,

03:24.438 --> 03:26.206
so she can live it up
while she's still alive.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.376
Fonzie told me about it on TV.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.678
I'm gonna get a nice fat check
every month

03:30.711 --> 03:32.946
while I'm living it up
down in Daytona

03:32.980 --> 03:35.549
with Delilah
and her husband.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.886
What? Maw Maw, you can't
leave us. We love you.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.922
Oh, drop the lovey-dovey
act, Ginny. You two
will be just fine.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.791
That's the beauty of
the reverse mortgage.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.059
While Maw Maw gets to travel
and do all the things she wants

03:46.093 --> 03:47.895
to do, you get to stay
in the house

03:47.928 --> 03:49.730
for the life of the mortgage.
Or Maw Maw.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.131
Whichever ends first.

03:51.164 --> 03:54.067
You belong here
with your family, not in some

03:54.101 --> 03:55.536
spring break
swamp town

03:55.569 --> 03:56.970
full of nothing
but drunk college kids

03:57.004 --> 03:58.572
having casual sex.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.574
Drunk college kids
and casual sex?

04:00.608 --> 04:02.610
What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.416
Thank you so much for coming.
This is actually

04:08.449 --> 04:10.050
our first time
interviewing babysitters,

04:10.083 --> 04:12.653
but you came
very highly recommended.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.823
You're too kind. It's easy to be
good when you love your work.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.057
What we really need...

04:17.090 --> 04:18.592
We don't speak

04:18.626 --> 04:20.428
unless spoken to, child.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.463
We have tickets to
CoverFest this Saturday.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.931
This year it's all

04:23.964 --> 04:26.667
hybrid cover bands.
The headliners are N.W.AC/DC

04:26.700 --> 04:28.636
and Red Hot Chili Vanilli.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.605
(quietly):
It's written in blood.
It's written in blood.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.974
You never have to worry

04:34.007 --> 04:36.577
about your child's safety
as long as I'm here.

04:36.610 --> 04:41.515
I customized it so there's
no safety to slow me down.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.453
TWINS:
We'd be happy to play
with Hope forever.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.854
And ever
And ever

04:46.887 --> 04:48.589
and ever
and ever

04:48.622 --> 04:50.123
and ever.
and ever.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.692
I love kids.

04:51.725 --> 04:54.127
I have four younger siblings
who I basically raised.

04:54.161 --> 04:57.598
I have a degree in Early
Childhood Development

04:57.631 --> 05:00.601
and I'm getting my master's
in Child Psychology.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.636
Wow. You seem...

05:02.670 --> 05:04.104
really qualified.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.706
Pass.

05:05.739 --> 05:06.774
(crickets chirping)

05:06.807 --> 05:08.342
I'm telling you, Burt.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.378
The reverse mortgage,

05:10.411 --> 05:11.845
moving Maw Maw down to Florida.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.481
I don't like any of this.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.216
Delilah's never looking out
for anyone but herself.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.651
Virginia, you're too stressed.
(sighs)

05:17.685 --> 05:19.219
I've told you,
when you get like this,

05:19.252 --> 05:20.554
you got to do what I do.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.523
I just close my eyes...

05:22.556 --> 05:26.159
and I drift off to a little
tropical paradise in my head

05:26.193 --> 05:29.229
that I like to call
Burt Island.

05:29.262 --> 05:32.533
There, I'm a millionaire
because I'm the only one

05:32.566 --> 05:35.068
who knows how to clean
and filter the ocean.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.138
A place where your cinnamon
toast Italian hoagies

05:38.171 --> 05:40.207
grow on trees.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.009
And there's a friendly islander

05:42.042 --> 05:44.412
who's just a little bit worse
than me at foosball,

05:44.445 --> 05:46.046
so I always win.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.048
Got you again,
Pupukaka!

05:48.081 --> 05:51.218
And all the women are the most
beautiful women I've ever
seen.

05:51.251 --> 05:52.886
Hi, Virginias.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.922
VIRGINIAS:
Hello, Burt.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.225
And aloha to you, Pupukaka.

05:58.258 --> 06:01.395
(chuckles)

06:03.296 --> 06:05.833
(chuckles)
And some of you are easy,

06:05.866 --> 06:07.367
some of you are too good for me.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.569
(sighs)
Now you try.

06:08.602 --> 06:09.770
You go to Virginia Island.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.773
Okay, fine.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.208
(sighs)

06:15.242 --> 06:17.445
(gulls squawking)

06:17.478 --> 06:20.080
Mmm.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.284
Hey, Ginny. I thought being
on a deserted island

06:24.317 --> 06:26.353
was supposed
to make you lose weight.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.354
(cackles)

06:27.387 --> 06:28.756
(groans)

06:28.789 --> 06:31.124
God. I can't do it, Burt.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.761
It may work for you, but my head
just won't let me go there.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.729
It just takes practice.
You stick with it.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.298
Here, have something sweet.
Help you calm down.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.100
(sniffs)

06:40.133 --> 06:42.402
Where'd you get these?

06:42.436 --> 06:43.937
Out of the trash can.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.139
Delilah threw them away,
but they taste fine to me.

06:46.173 --> 06:49.242
Burt... remember
when Jimmy needed braces

06:49.276 --> 06:50.978
and we didn't have any money?

06:51.011 --> 06:52.713
What did we do to get it?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.114
We sold our blood
every Wednesday

06:54.147 --> 06:55.649
for two years straight.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.118
The only good thing
about it was the delicious...

06:58.151 --> 06:59.620
Oh, my God.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.989
These are blood bank cookies.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.427
Aha. Look.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.229
Blood bank recovery juice.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.998
She's selling her blood.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.100
What kind of wealthy
suntan mogul needs

07:13.133 --> 07:14.802
to sell her own blood?

07:14.835 --> 07:16.970
See, I was gonna say Delilah,
but that's too obvious.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.439
Uh... think, think,
think, think, think.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.474
No, it's Delilah.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.575
Oh, damn it.

07:21.609 --> 07:24.144
I was really close that time.

07:28.482 --> 07:31.485
CPR training? President
of the Nutrition Club?

07:31.519 --> 07:34.021
Internship at a Danish
interlocking toy block company?

07:34.054 --> 07:37.024
You're perfect.
(groans) You have no idea
how many people we've seen.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.191
(chuckles)

07:38.225 --> 07:39.292
You're hired.
Oh.

07:39.326 --> 07:41.695
That's so cool of you, but...

07:41.729 --> 07:43.597
I got to ask you
a few questions

07:43.631 --> 07:45.265
because I only sit
for one family at a time,

07:45.298 --> 07:47.535
and I'm in, like,
really high demand.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.302
But you have to pick us.

07:49.336 --> 07:52.372
Our only other option is a woman
that has two hooks for hands.

07:52.405 --> 07:53.507
Oh, I know Claire.
She's awesome.

07:53.541 --> 07:54.675
We went zip-lining together.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.009
Oh, yeah?
Okay.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.779
I'm texting you
your first question now.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.514
Oh...

08:02.082 --> 08:04.885
Those Daytona spring breakers

08:04.918 --> 08:07.521
have no idea
who they'll be messing with.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.456
Okay, Maw Maw,
one more initial

08:09.489 --> 08:12.292
and you've got yourself
a reverse mortgage. Mmm.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.027
Put the pen down, Maw Maw.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.063
Why don't you ask Delilah here
about how she's broke

08:16.096 --> 08:18.666
and just came here to scam you
out of all your money.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.334
I don't know what you're
talking about. I don't
need Maw Maw's money.

08:21.368 --> 08:25.505
Oh, really? Then how come
you're selling your blood?

08:25.539 --> 08:27.841
Oh.
BURT:
Oh, we got to quit

08:27.875 --> 08:29.643
ripping people's clothes off
to prove they're liars.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.311
This is like when you thought
the mailman was a woman

08:31.344 --> 08:32.345
all over again.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.147
Except this time

08:34.181 --> 08:36.216
I'm... right!

08:36.249 --> 08:38.752
Oh, thank God.

08:38.786 --> 08:41.188
What do you have to say
for yourself now, Delilah?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.756
Suck it, Ginny.

08:42.790 --> 08:43.356
(shouts)

08:43.390 --> 08:45.392
(grunting)

08:47.360 --> 08:49.697
(grunts)
(Delilah shouts)

08:49.730 --> 08:51.699
(yelling)

08:53.200 --> 08:55.235
(grunting)

08:57.638 --> 08:58.706
(yells)

08:58.739 --> 08:59.973
(choking)

09:01.041 --> 09:02.442
(grunting)

09:03.410 --> 09:05.445
(stifled moan)

09:05.478 --> 09:06.413
I can't believe you two!

09:06.446 --> 09:07.915
Here you are,
grown women,

09:07.948 --> 09:09.016
and you're still fighting

09:09.049 --> 09:10.450
like when you were teenagers!

09:10.483 --> 09:11.619
Delilah started it

09:11.652 --> 09:12.853
when she came here trying

09:12.886 --> 09:14.554
to reverse cowgirl
your mortgage!

09:14.588 --> 09:16.757
Oh, I had to! I got nothing!

09:16.790 --> 09:18.926
It turns out
in the tanning bed industry

09:18.959 --> 09:20.594
you're always
one irregular mole away

09:20.628 --> 09:22.229
from being Yelp'd out
of the business.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.864
(grunts)
BURT:
Well, at least

09:23.897 --> 09:24.932
you've still got your husband.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.734
No, he left me
and re-enlisted.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.737
He said he'd rather go back to
clearing mines in Afghanistan.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.039
That it's easier on his nerves.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.573
Well, I'm done
with this fighting.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.643
You can both stay here,
but the first one of you

09:35.676 --> 09:38.145
who's not nice
to the other is out.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.412
Of the house?

09:39.446 --> 09:40.413
And my will.

09:40.447 --> 09:41.214
(gasps)

09:41.248 --> 09:42.115
The one who is

09:42.149 --> 09:43.416
nicest longest gets...

09:43.450 --> 09:44.818
all of this.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.454
(grunting)

09:49.489 --> 09:52.325
Now hug it out, bitches.

09:58.866 --> 10:02.135
...and, well, that's
when I realized that

10:02.169 --> 10:04.404
I just really love
this family and...

10:04.437 --> 10:06.640
I wanted to be Hope's
mother forever,

10:06.674 --> 10:08.642
so I adopted her
immediately.

10:08.676 --> 10:11.278
That's a nice story.
So, a minute ago,

10:11.311 --> 10:13.280
you mentioned
you have some licorice?

10:13.313 --> 10:16.416
Yeah, it's, uh...
it's just in the cupboard.

10:16.449 --> 10:20.220
Okay, here's the last question:
red or black?

10:21.454 --> 10:22.589
Red?

10:22.622 --> 10:23.957
Final answer?

10:24.825 --> 10:26.426
Yeah?

10:26.459 --> 10:27.961
Congratulations. I'm hired.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.097
Really? (chuckles)
That's amazing!

10:30.130 --> 10:32.833
Mmm!
All right, so, uh...

10:32.866 --> 10:35.035
I guess we will see
you on Saturday.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.870
Oh, this Saturday?
I can't do that.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.806
The concert is this Saturday.
That's...

10:38.839 --> 10:40.640
why we wanted you
in the first place.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.943
I'm sorry. I have a history
project that's due on Monday,

10:42.976 --> 10:45.045
and I have to spend
the weekend working on it.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.146
History?

10:46.179 --> 10:47.781
We'll do it for you.

10:47.815 --> 10:48.615
What?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.350
I need this, Jimmy.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.120
I'm sorry. You know how much
I love that little girl,

10:53.153 --> 10:56.957
but I need some adult time alone
with my adult husband

10:56.990 --> 10:58.625
so I can have
adult drinks

10:58.658 --> 10:59.960
(quietly):
and do the adult things.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.395
So, what are we doing
this project on?

11:03.731 --> 11:07.334
Who wants the last piece of pie?

11:07.367 --> 11:08.702
You take it,
Virginia.

11:08.736 --> 11:11.872
It's obvious
you're a big fan of pie.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.140
Yes, I am.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.076
I eat it with my
husband all the time.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.515
MAN (over television):
In local weather,

11:22.549 --> 11:24.818
lots of sunshine coming our way
for the next few days.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.020
Oh, I put some glue
on the remote

11:27.054 --> 11:28.655
because you said
next time you lost it,

11:28.688 --> 11:30.590
you would just glue it
to your hand.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.760
Oh, was that in jest?

11:32.793 --> 11:33.894
Because you might not want
to touch

11:33.927 --> 11:36.696
your wallet, keys, or tampons.

11:36.730 --> 11:37.597
(sighs)

11:37.630 --> 11:40.067
(sniffs)

11:40.100 --> 11:41.701
Oh, my Lord.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.604
Why the heck does my room
smell like a cow's dumper?

11:44.637 --> 11:45.906
Oh, I wanted
to brighten up the room

11:45.939 --> 11:47.340
for you
with some flowers.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.541
Don't worry,

11:48.575 --> 11:50.577
they're going
to live a long time.

11:50.610 --> 11:53.213
I used a lot
of fertilizer.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.448
No.
(groans)

12:00.220 --> 12:02.089
You know, they're not
going to pay you extra

12:02.122 --> 12:03.891
if they can drink
out of the bowl.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.760
Sorry, I'd rather be
here than at home.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.295
Thanks to my
cousin Delilah,

12:08.328 --> 12:10.630
cleaning toilets is now
the best part of my day.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.800
(chuckles)
I know where you're at.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.534
Try being married
to a guy who decided

12:14.567 --> 12:17.370
to become a Cher impersonator
at age 50.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.272
Knock, knock, knock.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.707
BOTH:
Who's there?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.042
Your new crew member.

12:22.075 --> 12:26.313
Well, if it isn't
Slumdog Nothingaire.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.480
Maw Maw insisted

12:27.514 --> 12:29.950
I take a job here
alongside my new

12:29.983 --> 12:31.118
best friend.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.485
Oh, my God.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.487
We're gonna be together
24 hours a day.

12:34.521 --> 12:38.959
Virginia Island, Virginia
Island, Virginia Island.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.930
Ah, that's nice.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.300
What?

12:47.334 --> 12:49.602
(mouthing)

12:49.636 --> 12:51.771
No, no.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.373
No.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.476
I can't get it to work.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.649
Maw Maw wants her eggs the way
you were in high school--

13:02.682 --> 13:03.851
over easy.

13:03.884 --> 13:07.354
I mean, bent over easy.
(chuckles)

13:07.387 --> 13:10.190
We're not having eggs,
Delilah, it's dinnertime.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.092
Oh, good, I love your cooking.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.327
It's never rich-- like you.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.629
That's it.
Oh, Virginia, no, no, no, no!

13:16.663 --> 13:20.067
God.
She wants you to hit her
so she'll get the house.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.970
What's that I hear?

13:23.003 --> 13:24.204
Oh, it's a bird only
found on Virginia Island.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.039
Koo-la-roo, koo-la-roo.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.040
(exhales)

13:27.074 --> 13:28.942
Now just take it all in.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.643
I'm there serving you
a drink buck naked--

13:30.677 --> 13:32.112
just a suggestion.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.613
I don't know what game
you two are playing,

13:33.646 --> 13:37.284
but if Burt's naked, I'm all in.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.786
Oh, God, I can't do
the island thing, okay?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.688
I've never been
a beach person.

13:41.721 --> 13:44.024
Sand, sunscreen,
and brightly colored towels--

13:44.057 --> 13:45.358
it just stresses me out.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.327
It doesn't have to
be an actual island,

13:47.360 --> 13:48.828
just anyplace
that relaxes you.

13:48.862 --> 13:51.231
What makes you happier
than anything else?

13:51.264 --> 13:52.365
Okay.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.400
Okay.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.335
Okay, it's working.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.804
I'm on Virginia Island.
Yeah,

13:57.837 --> 14:00.573
it's working for me, too,
only I'm on Burt Peninsula.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.175
It's a lot like Florida,

14:02.209 --> 14:05.212
only Burt's naked and doing me
like I owe him money.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.846
Cha-ching.
(chuckles)

14:06.880 --> 14:08.348
Virginia can't
hear you, Delilah,

14:08.381 --> 14:09.482
'cause Virginia
Island is surrounded

14:09.516 --> 14:11.351
by a soundproof bitch bubble.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.220
(doorbell rings)

14:13.253 --> 14:15.655
SABRINA:
Oh, good, you're here.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.524
We can go over
your project together.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.193
So, um, that is your visual aid
and here are your note cards.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.361
I can't do this right now.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.495
What do you mean?
You said you had

14:22.529 --> 14:23.830
to finish your project
by tonight

14:23.863 --> 14:25.498
so you could babysit
for us tomorrow.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.367
I'm sorry, I can't concentrate.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.369
I was going to break
up with my boyfriend
on the way over here,

14:29.402 --> 14:32.906
but I lost my nerve and now
he's waiting for me outside.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.442
Okay, yeah, yeah,
we can help you with that.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.244
Jimmy, go break up with him.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.411
Huh?
Really?

14:38.445 --> 14:39.512
That would be great.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.413
I don't think that...

14:40.447 --> 14:41.748
Jimmy.
Hmm?

14:41.781 --> 14:43.516
I hope I never have
to say this to you

14:43.550 --> 14:45.785
ever again, but I need you
to go outside and break up

14:45.818 --> 14:47.754
with that teenage boy
for the sake of our marriage.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.923
Is he a crier?

14:49.957 --> 14:51.358
A little bit.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.493
I'll do anything.

14:54.794 --> 14:58.631
It's not you,
it's her.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.436
(high-pitched sobbing)

15:04.904 --> 15:06.873
Wow.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.243
You were right, Burt,
that was fantastic.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.779
What me and Burt just
did was fantastic, too.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.281
He twisted me up
like a little,

15:14.314 --> 15:15.382
soft pretzel.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.649
Introduced my ankles to my ears.

15:16.683 --> 15:17.951
(chuckles)

15:17.985 --> 15:19.819
I did not make
any such introductions.

15:19.852 --> 15:23.490
Oh, Delilah, I'm sorry you're
having such a hard time.

15:23.523 --> 15:24.657
I'm not having
a hard time.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.093
Your face is
having a hard time

15:26.126 --> 15:28.228
distinguishing itself
from your behind.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.329
You are ugly,

15:29.362 --> 15:32.665
fat, poor, poor, fat, ugly.

15:32.699 --> 15:33.800
You said that one already.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.102
You live with
your grandma.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.104
This is just getting sad.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.106
No, what's sad is that you
think you have won this house.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.708
You have no idea who you
are messing with, sister.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.712
(screaming)

15:46.479 --> 15:49.649
(all screaming)

15:57.124 --> 16:02.029
Maw Maw, Virginia
just broke my arm!

16:02.062 --> 16:05.999
(screams)

16:09.536 --> 16:11.471
Mmm.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.173
Don't worry, Ginny,

16:13.206 --> 16:14.874
no one's pressing
charges here.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.776
Maw Maw,
she did it to herself.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.211
You got to believe me.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.446
Stop lying, Virginia.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.813
I couldn't break my own arm,

16:20.847 --> 16:22.315
and my bones are like
blackboard chalk.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.384
The rules were clear.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.652
Delilah gets
the house.

16:25.685 --> 16:26.719
(gasps)
What?

16:26.753 --> 16:28.055
Thank you, Maw Maw.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.289
Don't worry, Ginny,

16:29.322 --> 16:30.723
I just want
you to know

16:30.757 --> 16:32.225
that you and Burt
are welcome to live here

16:32.259 --> 16:34.061
as long as you want, assuming
you sleep in Jimmy's room,

16:34.094 --> 16:36.663
pay rent, and live by my rules.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.398
(sighs)
Another piña colada?

16:38.431 --> 16:39.999
Thank you, Virginia
Number Seven.

16:40.033 --> 16:43.036
Need you
on the mainland, Burt.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.875
Oh, man, van living
was much easier

16:48.908 --> 16:50.910
when we were
in our 20s.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.813
(grunts)

16:53.846 --> 16:55.415
I want to do it, Burt.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.218
Okay, but you're going to
have to do most of the work.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.486
I can barely move.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.654
No, not that.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.156
I want to take the promotion.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.824
Are you sure?
Yeah,

17:04.857 --> 17:06.226
we're too old for you
to be driving me

17:06.259 --> 17:07.994
to work in our house.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.262
Well, I'm proud of you.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.064
You know, this
wouldn't be our house

17:11.098 --> 17:12.932
if we just stayed with
Jimmy and Sabrina.

17:12.965 --> 17:14.334
No way.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.602
It's one thing to mooch
off my grandmother.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.537
I'm not about to mooch
off my own son.

17:17.570 --> 17:20.039
I have pride, Burt.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.274
Car wash is open.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.076
Let's go sneak a shower.

17:26.313 --> 17:29.382
Okay, Ashley, uh, we'll
be home around 1:00.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.517
You guys have fun.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.352
And, Hope,
Ashley's in charge,

17:32.385 --> 17:33.720
so you got to listen
to her, all right?

17:33.753 --> 17:35.888
You got to go to bed
when she tells you to.

17:35.922 --> 17:36.756
Yeah.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.891
Mwah.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.560
She feels a little bit warm.
Nah, she's fine.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.862
She's just running around
outside for the last hour.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.197
You're right, you're
totally right.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.965
So, Ashley,
you have our numbers.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.368
Please feel free to call
with absolutely anything.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.369
Don't worry, have fun.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.104
CoverFest!

17:51.138 --> 17:53.806
Ooh, you know what?

17:53.840 --> 17:56.143
Maybe I should just show
her where the chewable
aspirin is just in case.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.378
Oh, I think after the charts
and the second walk-through,

17:58.411 --> 18:00.780
she knows where more stuff
in our house is than I do.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.416
You're right, I'm
sorry, let's just go

18:03.450 --> 18:06.153
because CoverFest only
happens once a year.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.955
CoverFest!

18:08.988 --> 18:10.490
I don't know.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.924
Sabrina, let's not overreact.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.626
When I was a kid, my parents
went to Lollapalooza

18:13.660 --> 18:15.395
even after I swallowed
a jar of pennies.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.729
And I was fine,

18:16.763 --> 18:17.930
although when I pooped,
it sounded

18:17.964 --> 18:19.599
like the jackpot
from a slot machine.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.834
(sighs)

18:22.802 --> 18:24.537
Yeah, I heard it
as I said it.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.541
Hey, Ashley.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.878
Do you like
Maroon Five for Fighting?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.982
Look who it is.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.684
I guess a week of
living in the van

18:37.717 --> 18:40.353
was enough to force these two
to come crawling back.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.654
Don't worry.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.323
We're just here
to pick up some things.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.824
Then we're gonna go look
at apartments.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.093
I hear they have
exposed brick and high ceilings

18:47.126 --> 18:48.528
under the 8th Street Bridge.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.829
For your information,

18:49.862 --> 18:52.999
we're looking for
a real apartment.

18:53.032 --> 18:55.034
The kind of apartment you can
afford when you're married

18:55.067 --> 18:57.504
to the new
Knock Knock Knock crew chief.

18:57.537 --> 18:58.438
You actually went

18:58.471 --> 19:00.273
after that promotion?

19:00.307 --> 19:02.342
I thought you were afraid
you couldn't deal with people.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.844
Yeah, after Burt taught me
his trick for taking crap,

19:04.877 --> 19:06.546
I wasn't scared
anymore.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.015
Funny thing is, once I started,

19:09.048 --> 19:11.184
I never even needed
Virginia Island.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.019
I gave the clients
a cleaning form

19:13.052 --> 19:15.822
so we wouldn't miss things
they wanted us to do.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.958
And I got Knock Knock Knock

19:18.991 --> 19:21.294
to give everyone
an extra 15 minutes at lunch

19:21.328 --> 19:23.396
to take care
of personal matters.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.999
And then the handsome gardener
turned to the sexy maid

19:27.033 --> 19:29.736
and said,
"Take me, take me now."

19:29.769 --> 19:33.039
(sighing)

19:33.072 --> 19:35.041
Turns out,
if the clients aren't mad

19:35.074 --> 19:38.511
and the workers aren't mad,
the bosses aren't mad.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.880
So you're going
to keep the job?

19:40.913 --> 19:42.582
Yeah, I'm pretty
good at it

19:42.615 --> 19:44.551
and I actually kind
of like it, too.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.719
Good.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.355
Get out.
What?

19:48.388 --> 19:51.791
I only invited you here
to light a fire under Virginia.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.660
You planned this?

19:53.693 --> 19:54.994
Of course.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.430
When you're lucid,
you are scary lucid.

19:57.464 --> 19:58.898
Wait a minute,
so you just

19:58.931 --> 20:01.534
used me so this one
could become a better maid?

20:01.568 --> 20:03.270
Yep, I always knew
she could do it.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.604
Someone just
needed to push her

20:04.637 --> 20:07.106
so she could find out
for herself.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.409
Information I could have used

20:09.442 --> 20:11.043
before I broke my own arm.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.447
Just so you know,

20:14.481 --> 20:17.584
if I catch you getting
lazy again, I'm telling her

20:17.617 --> 20:22.689
about the Nazi gold
Wilfred buried in the yard.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.024
Wow.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.360
Maw Maw's just an eye patch
and a Persian cat away

20:27.394 --> 20:28.761
from being
a supervillain.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.564
I'm glad we take such
good care of her.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.966
Keeps us on
her good side.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.302
So you never told me

20:35.335 --> 20:37.103
how you finally got
Virginia Island to work?

20:37.136 --> 20:41.441
Well, it's not
actually an island.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.744
It's more of a
place where...

20:44.777 --> 20:49.248
you see nothing but the most
beautiful sky full of stars,

20:49.282 --> 20:51.918
and the only sounds you hear
are crickets,

20:51.951 --> 20:53.386
and when you take a breath,

20:53.420 --> 20:56.789
you smell
the most delicious barbecue,

20:56.823 --> 20:58.825
and all my favorite people
are there

20:58.858 --> 21:01.260
just doing what we always do.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.599
That sounds like our backyard
on a Saturday night.

21:06.633 --> 21:10.470
There is one difference.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.076
Hey, what's wrong with you?

21:17.109 --> 21:20.012
Even in your fantasies you can't
go to a nice restaurant?

21:20.046 --> 21:21.681
Hey, why don't you hand me down
a straw

21:21.714 --> 21:23.750
so I can pole-vault up there
and slap you in the face?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.151
(chuckles)
No.

21:25.184 --> 21:27.286
Hey, not cool, cuz.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.955
Let me out of here.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.823
My voice is bouncing
off the walls.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.459
Is this
what I really sound like?

21:32.492 --> 21:34.126
Aah!

21:34.160 --> 21:35.695
(laughs)

21:35.728 --> 21:38.698
(boat horn blows)
MAN: What's a second second?
