WEBVTT

00:12.846 --> 00:14.848
[siren wailing in the distance]

00:15.849 --> 00:18.560
-I really don't think I bit him.
-But what if you did?

00:18.643 --> 00:20.937
And what if that makes him turn,
and then he bites someone,

00:21.021 --> 00:23.982
and they bite someone, and pretty soon,
we're like the biggest assholes ever.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.652
No, we're gonna be fine.
I didn't bite him.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.864
Because if I had,
I'd have gotten the tingle.

00:30.947 --> 00:32.532
-Right.
-In my vagina.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.950
-No, I got it.
-[sighs]

00:34.034 --> 00:36.494
That first moment
when I tear into living flesh is like--

00:36.578 --> 00:37.912
Totally up to speed, honey.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.543
I should have killed him.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.880
Sweetheart, it's not your fault
that Loki got away.

00:46.963 --> 00:50.800
You only had the one shoe on
and you had a very light breakfast.

00:50.884 --> 00:55.638
I used to be the guy, you know.
Crunch time? Give Ice the ball.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.807
"Ice"? When did they call you "Ice"?

00:58.641 --> 01:01.478
There was a guy.
It was an away game. You didn't go.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.605
-So there was one guy once.
-My point is--

01:03.688 --> 01:06.483
Didn't they always give you the ball?
You were the quarterback.

01:07.442 --> 01:11.279
All I'm saying is, if I had stopped Loki,
we wouldn't be in a car

01:11.362 --> 01:14.240
for the better part of two days
waiting for him to return.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.743
-So you're not a killer.
-[sighs]

01:16.826 --> 01:19.829
I love you for who you are,
not who you think you should be.

01:21.706 --> 01:22.999
He's not coming home.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.710
A guy like that, two strangers show up,

01:25.794 --> 01:28.546
you don't know who sent them
or when they're coming back?

01:28.630 --> 01:30.757
You don't return home. You skip town.

01:31.591 --> 01:32.592
Maybe.

01:32.675 --> 01:37.096
Come on, Ice. Ice. Baby?

01:37.889 --> 01:39.641
[chuckles]

01:39.724 --> 01:41.100
You're lucky you're cute

01:41.184 --> 01:43.770
and that's my favorite song
in the entire world.

01:43.853 --> 01:47.065
Come on, let's go home.
I promised Lisa we'd go to their barbecue.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.400
-You clicked "yes" on the Evite?
-I did.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.487
-I told you to click "maybe."
-Only douches click "maybe."

01:52.570 --> 01:55.365
It's like saying, "Yes,
unless something better comes along."

01:55.448 --> 01:58.993
Or, "Yes, unless I fail to pull off
a murder for your husband

01:59.077 --> 02:01.913
and he gets back from his alibi trip
and wants to know how it went."

02:02.497 --> 02:05.625
Just tell Dan you took care of it.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.212
[chuckles]

02:11.047 --> 02:15.301
[Sheila] <i>Loki's gone,</i>
<i>and we covered our tracks.</i>

02:15.385 --> 02:22.058
<i>There's nothing to tie us to anything.</i>
<i>It's like we were never there.</i>

02:27.397 --> 02:30.400
[instrumental theme music playing]

02:34.237 --> 02:36.531
-Pretty good, huh?
-Yeah, it's amazing.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.283
-I know.
-Hi, Amy.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.784
-Hi, Sheila.
-Love your sandals.

02:40.743 --> 02:44.205
Hey, Ed. Got a beer. All right.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.666
Is small talk harder for you
ever since we started killing people?

02:46.749 --> 02:47.750
Yeah. A little bit.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.712
-Hey, Sheila!
-Hey, Kelly!

02:51.504 --> 02:52.589
Look at your hat!

02:52.672 --> 02:54.507
-I know!
-[Dan] Joel!

02:55.675 --> 02:57.552
Excuse me, I gotta go lie to a cop

02:57.635 --> 03:00.346
and tell him I murdered somebody
so I don't get in trouble.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.223
Okay, I'll be over there with the girls

03:02.307 --> 03:04.100
drinking some guy from Vegas
out of a straw,

03:04.183 --> 03:07.020
so I don't think anyone's getting
a merit badge for honesty.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.480
Anyway, the trick to planting rosebushes

03:09.564 --> 03:12.275
is you gotta get a little bone meal
in there to nourish the root system.

03:12.358 --> 03:16.279
Without bone meal, flowers are shit.
You didn't know that, did you?

03:16.362 --> 03:17.989
I don't think I'm ever gonna like you.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.950
-Here comes someone who likes me.
-You think so, huh?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.578
Maybe you didn't hear, Rick,
but Joel and I are best friends now.

03:23.661 --> 03:26.706
-Right, Joel?
-Yes. We are best friends now.

03:26.789 --> 03:27.957
Thank God.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.294
This "will they, won't they" thing
has been going on too long.

03:35.548 --> 03:40.470
-So, I paid a visit to your friend Loki.
-Not even gonna ask me about my trip?

03:40.553 --> 03:45.475
-Okay, sure. How was your trip?
-Who gives a shit? You did it.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.060
I thought you were too much of a pussy,

03:47.143 --> 03:49.354
but my CI said
he missed his last two drops.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.397
You fucking killed that...

03:51.981 --> 03:53.733
What kind of a name is Loki, anyway?

03:53.816 --> 03:57.320
I didn't ask before I fucking killed him.

03:58.029 --> 04:01.532
But I'm pretty sure Loki's
the trickster god from Norse mythology.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.035
I took a class in junior college
on folk and fables.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.371
Credits didn't transfer,
but it's paying off now. [chuckles]

04:06.454 --> 04:09.332
Yeah, big time.
So, what'd you do with the body?

04:09.415 --> 04:11.584
What didn't I do with the body?

04:13.002 --> 04:16.714
That sounded more sexual than I intended.
I disposed of him respectfully.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.634
-Dan.
-I'm talking with my friend.

04:19.717 --> 04:23.221
-We need more meat.
-I'll get it, my love.

04:23.304 --> 04:25.765
Stay here. There's something else
that we need to discuss.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.728
I can't believe you're not eating
any of this food. You're so good.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.272
Oh, no. It all looks amazing.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.399
I'm just straight-up addicted
to these smoothies.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.025
I am so impressed with your willpower.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.403
I can't even get it together
to end my affair.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.489
Or at least stop talking about it
with your husband 15 feet away.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.950
Uh, the danger is part
of what makes it so hot.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.702
That and the filthy, filthy sex.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.913
I mean, it's so crazy.
It's, like, feral, like street cats.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.834
And the stamina.
Just fucking and fucking, fucking--

04:52.917 --> 04:55.420
Please, I'm not getting the picture,
more detail.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.505
-Okay. His dick--
-Oh, my God.

04:57.588 --> 05:00.550
Oh, I'm sorry. But you don't know
what it's like to be trapped

05:00.633 --> 05:02.302
in an unloving third marriage.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.053
You guys never have problems.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.015
-I wouldn't say that.
-What? Tell me.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.685
What is it? Did you catch Joel
drawing pictures of another woman?

05:10.768 --> 05:12.186
It just happened to my sister.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.647
Yeah, no, that wasn't it.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.775
Just, Joel and I do this thing together
and I'm way better at it

05:17.859 --> 05:19.277
and I think he's feeling inadequate.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.903
-Is it oral?
-No.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.031
-It's, um...
-Oral?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.783
No. It's bowling.

05:25.867 --> 05:29.454
And the last time we tried it together,
I'm getting really good at it

05:29.537 --> 05:32.707
-and Joel couldn't even finish the game.
-You know what it sounds like?

05:33.916 --> 05:34.876
Oral.

05:35.376 --> 05:39.505
Well, maybe you should just keep
doing your thing, whatever it is.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.382
It might be bowling, we don't know.

05:41.466 --> 05:45.344
But do it by yourself and encourage Joel
to find something that he's good at.

05:46.345 --> 05:48.264
-Huh.
-Yeah, like hand stuff.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.058
Joel played trumpet in high school,

05:50.141 --> 05:52.894
so he's really good
with his lips and his hands.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.188
Plus, he can keep a beat.

05:55.271 --> 05:59.192
-But thanks, Alondra, for your advice.
-You may not take it. Most people don't.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.569
My sister didn't listen to me
and now she's getting divorced.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.988
But we're super competitive,
so I'm okay with it.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.783
Anyway, she needs to sell her house.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.953
-Do you have a card?
-No, but I have a pen.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.706
It has all our information on it, so...

06:13.790 --> 06:15.541
[items rattling]

06:15.625 --> 06:18.086
anyone can find us.

06:18.169 --> 06:21.839
Oh, my God, it was in my purse.
I can't find it. Oh, fuck!

06:24.592 --> 06:27.053
Damn it, damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

06:32.683 --> 06:36.062
-Nice buns.
-[chuckles] Nice icebreaker.

06:36.145 --> 06:38.106
I haven't seen you around
in a couple days.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.607
I've been kind of busy.

06:39.690 --> 06:42.902
Robots don't build themselves. Yet.

06:44.737 --> 06:48.366
Are we cool?
I mean, after what happened the other day?

06:48.449 --> 06:49.992
The other day?

06:50.076 --> 06:52.286
Oh, when I tried to kiss you
and you pulled away, horrified.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.331
-No, I totally forgot about that.
-Totally. Me too.

06:55.414 --> 06:57.291
I just don't want things
to be awkward between us.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.876
In case we ever do remember it.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.420
I won't be awkward...

07:02.463 --> 07:05.049
-Princess Leia.
-Yeah, like this.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.676
-Hoo-ahh!
-[yelps]

07:06.759 --> 07:09.929
There he is. Love that sound. All man.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.642
So I guess now
you really want to kiss me.

07:16.185 --> 07:19.313
This barbecue's boring.
Let's get out of here, do something fun.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.482
Oh, I don't know.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.406
Help me, Eric-wan Kenobi,
you're my only hope.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.116
Nerd.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.536
You stayed. Good boy.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.914
You know,
we've been best friends for 48 hours,

07:36.998 --> 07:38.708
so I feel like I can make a suggestion.

07:38.791 --> 07:43.254
Maybe you don't be a dick to everybody,
including your stepson.

07:44.672 --> 07:48.134
Food for thought. So, killer,
I got another guy who needs to go.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.969
-What?
-He's a sex trafficker.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.679
You want me to kill again?

07:51.762 --> 07:54.223
I've spent two years chasing this scumbag.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.350
Every time I get close,
he bribes someone, leaves town.

07:56.434 --> 08:01.814
He's back for a few days to sell
his product. Girls, Joel. He sells girls.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.900
What kind of asshole
doesn't kill a guy like that?

08:03.983 --> 08:04.984
You're worse than he is.

08:05.067 --> 08:08.279
First of all, no, I'm not.
And I thought we were done.

08:08.362 --> 08:11.157
We're not done, buddy.
I've got two murders on you.

08:13.159 --> 08:17.371
You know what you need?
Some of Lisa's coleslaw. It's wonderful.

08:20.124 --> 08:22.585
Hey, Joel, I brought you
one of these beers I've been drinking.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.669
It's got honey in it.

08:24.295 --> 08:28.257
Honey? Jesus Christ, Ed,
that's such fucking good news.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.761
When we borrowed your stepdad's tear gas,

08:31.844 --> 08:34.764
I saw these other things
that looked kind of fun.

08:35.473 --> 08:36.516
Here they are.

08:37.850 --> 08:41.145
-These explode, right?
-Uh, kind of. They're flash bang grenades.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.565
-They're super loud and super bright.
-You know what'd be cool?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.984
Taking a bunch to the desert
and setting 'em off.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.861
Oh, you know what'd be even cooler?

08:48.945 --> 08:51.531
Putting them back and then not
having Dan find out I took his stuff.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.241
That'd be crazy, right?

08:53.824 --> 08:55.826
-[yelps]
-[clattering]

09:00.790 --> 09:03.000
-I yipped again, huh?
-Barely.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.419
-Where'd it go?
-There.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.796
I think it rolled under those shelves.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.257
Oh, I see it.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.679
[Eric] Can you get it?

09:15.471 --> 09:17.056
[hollow thump]

09:18.182 --> 09:19.183
What the...?

09:20.935 --> 09:23.688
-Part of the wall just opened.
-What? What are you talking about?

09:23.771 --> 09:25.189
Help me. Come on.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.616
-[gasps] Fuck.
-Whoa.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.827
-Look at all this stuff.
-Yeah.

09:37.910 --> 09:41.038
It's gotta be Dan's. He's a crooked cop.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.376
He's got a closet full of illegal shit

09:45.459 --> 09:48.087
but he chews me out
for riding my bike on the sidewalk.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.300
What do you say we forget the flash bangs
and have some real fun today?

09:52.925 --> 09:54.093
I'm not doing cocaine, Abby.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.345
I just have a feeling
I would be unbearable.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.639
I'm not talking about drugs.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.100
Okay, that's an even worse idea.

10:01.183 --> 10:04.937
Dan is definitely gonna notice
if I steal $20,000 from him.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.772
-He'll kill me.
-[sighs]

10:06.856 --> 10:10.901
You're right, it's insane.
Let's start with a thousand.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.113
[door opens, shuts]

10:15.489 --> 10:18.576
-We have a problem.
-I know. I can't find my pen.

10:18.659 --> 10:19.994
I'm gonna say my problem's bigger.

10:20.077 --> 10:24.165
Bigger than I left my pen
with our names on it at Loki's apartment?

10:24.957 --> 10:26.125
Damn it.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.294
Why can't we ever have
one easy fucking day?

10:28.377 --> 10:31.130
-I know!
-Dan wants me to kill again.

10:31.213 --> 10:34.383
Oh, really?
Who does he want us to kill this time?

10:34.467 --> 10:37.720
-Sex trafficker.
-[chuckles] Nice and bad.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.097
No. We can't keep doing this for him.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.224
Well, I'm almost finished
with the guy in the freezer.

10:42.308 --> 10:46.437
It's just thighs and giblets.
And what's worse than a sex trafficker?

10:46.520 --> 10:49.732
Maybe we need to change
our perspective on this.

10:49.815 --> 10:53.361
Maybe Dan is working for us.

10:53.444 --> 10:57.239
And he's like our little truffle pig
just leading us to tasty morsels.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.491
[nibbling]

11:00.826 --> 11:04.330
That may be the most beautiful thing
anyone's ever said about Dan,

11:04.413 --> 11:06.499
but I'm sorry, honey,
I'm just not doing it.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.293
Okay.

11:11.128 --> 11:12.129
I'm serious.

11:12.797 --> 11:16.842
I thought about what you said in the car,
and you're right, I'm not a killer.

11:17.426 --> 11:19.470
All right. I can do this alone.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.847
I got a new kill poncho.

11:23.557 --> 11:26.644
It's pink, you know, because why not?

11:26.727 --> 11:28.771
You know, I'm not just talking about Dan.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.773
I'm saying I'm not going with you
at all anymore.

11:30.856 --> 11:31.732
Got it.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.568
-Ever.
-Roger that.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.573
-Okay, what's your game?
-No game, honey.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.617
You're just being really straightforward
and honest with me

11:41.700 --> 11:43.953
and I truly appreciate that,
so let's try your plan.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.538
Good. Let's.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.332
And what's my role in my plan?

11:49.542 --> 11:50.668
It's getting the pen, isn't it?

11:51.544 --> 11:56.924
Sneaking into a criminal's apartment
at night, not getting caught.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.718
-Sneaking back out--
-With a pen. I get it.

11:59.802 --> 12:03.389
-I'm in charge of pens.
-Said the brutally handsome man.

12:03.472 --> 12:06.725
-Now you're just making it worse.
-Am I, stud?

12:11.730 --> 12:15.067
"A branch from Groot.
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy,</i> 2014."

12:15.151 --> 12:17.528
Wow, I've never been this close
to a celebrity.

12:17.611 --> 12:18.446
You should buy it.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.323
It's $1,000. If we get this,
we won't have anything left for you.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.616
I don't care.

12:23.826 --> 12:28.748
Wait... are you just doing this
because you feel bad about not kissing me?

12:28.831 --> 12:29.832
No.

12:30.875 --> 12:31.709
A little.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.922
So much stuff has happened to me
over the past couple of weeks

12:37.006 --> 12:39.550
but it's been okay
because I've had you to talk to.

12:40.301 --> 12:43.971
So when I see how
your shitty stepdad treats you, I...

12:44.805 --> 12:48.350
I just want to make you happy.
'Cause you deserve to be happy.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.228
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.606
Let's buy you that stick.

12:53.689 --> 12:54.899
First, Groot's not a stick.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.151
He's a plant that believes
in the power of community.

12:57.234 --> 13:00.112
But even still, that's not gonna do it.

13:00.196 --> 13:04.283
Okay, how about a communicator
from <i>Star Trek</i>?

13:04.366 --> 13:08.078
A wand from <i>Now You See Me 2</i>?
Kevin Bacon's hat from <i>Tremors</i>?

13:08.162 --> 13:11.624
I like the hat but none of that's
gonna make me happy.

13:11.707 --> 13:12.958
Then what will?

13:13.334 --> 13:15.336
-It's dumb.
-What?

13:16.045 --> 13:20.883
Every day,
Dan makes me feel small and stupid.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.637
I'd like to make him feel that way.
Just once.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.518
-What if we made him yip?
-[chuckles]

13:30.601 --> 13:33.437
-That'd be sweet. But how?
-I don't know.

13:34.730 --> 13:39.568
But however we do it,
you're gonna do it in Kevin Bacon's hat.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.280
-All set.
-Do you have your poncho?

13:43.364 --> 13:44.698
-Yep.
-Christmas tree bag?

13:44.782 --> 13:46.367
-Got it.
-Did you remember a snack?

13:47.535 --> 13:50.037
-Fingers.
-That's fun.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.248
Now if you have any problem
killing this guy,

13:52.331 --> 13:54.375
any problem at all, you call me, okay?

13:54.458 --> 13:56.877
And if you have any problems
finding that pen...

13:56.961 --> 13:58.170
Yes, I'll call.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.713
Look at us.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.466
Dividing up tasks, nobody doing
what they don't want to do.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.552
-This is good for us.
-I guess.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.929
Although I feel like
I'm not really holding up my end.

14:07.012 --> 14:10.182
Well, honey, we shouldn't force each other
to do something

14:10.266 --> 14:12.017
the other person doesn't want to do.

14:12.101 --> 14:16.021
Like when I dragged you to see
the World Famous Lipizzaner Stallions.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.606
It was eight horses walking sideways.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.400
They don't even try
to make it entertaining.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.611
Larry King said it was the best show
he'd ever seen.

14:22.695 --> 14:26.115
Maybe, maybe for 30 seconds
it's a little interesting.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.784
Okay, I see your point.
We don't have to do everything together.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.077
Exactly.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.706
Like, when we're out of toilet paper,
we don't have to both go run to the store.

14:33.789 --> 14:37.626
-You want me to get toilet paper?
-Not if you don't want to.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.461
There is a Rite Aid on your way home

14:39.545 --> 14:42.131
and you are looking for more ways
to hold up your end.

14:46.760 --> 14:47.928
[sultry meow]

14:53.309 --> 14:57.605
[sighs] Where are you,
you sex-trafficking son of a bitch?

15:05.237 --> 15:06.655
[elevator bell dings]

15:09.241 --> 15:11.702
Oh, there he... is.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.832
It's okay. You can do this solo.

15:19.793 --> 15:20.878
-[horn honks]
-[gasps]

15:32.932 --> 15:34.892
[dog barking in the distance]

15:45.069 --> 15:47.071
Loki? Hello?

15:47.154 --> 15:49.156
[siren blaring in the distance]

15:57.665 --> 15:59.917
-[gasping] Gah!
-[hissing]

16:00.376 --> 16:02.461
[exhaling sharply]

16:04.797 --> 16:07.716
-Yo, who the fuck are you?
-Joel. [grunts]

16:07.800 --> 16:09.969
What's going on? Where's Loki?

16:10.052 --> 16:11.762
-I don't know.
-Get the fuck off his sofa.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.806
You know how he feels
about shoes on his furniture.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.726
-There's a snake.
-Did you hurt Baby?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.895
That snake's a rescue.
He's already been through a lot.

16:19.979 --> 16:20.980
Yo, there's blood.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.315
[man] What the fuck is going on, Joel?

16:23.399 --> 16:25.734
I mean, we're here to party
with our boy Loki,

16:25.818 --> 16:29.321
everything's trashed
and you're disrespecting the man's sofa.

16:29.405 --> 16:34.284
Okay, I'll be honest.
Joel isn't my real name, it's Buck.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.495
I came here to purchase cocaine.

16:36.578 --> 16:39.623
Loki wasn't home
and the place was in disarray.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.209
I was starting to leave
when I was startled by the snake,

16:42.292 --> 16:43.669
Baby, a rescue.

16:43.752 --> 16:49.925
Now having explained myself, I'll go.
No cocaine for Buck. Oh, well.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.762
-Hey, Joel!
-Mm-hmm, yeah?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.973
-[groans]
-You're not going anywhere.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.434
Not until Marcus gets here.
He'll know what to do with you.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.854
Siri, call Marcus, mobile.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.457
There it is.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.543
The second Dan digs too close,
boom and yip.

17:24.626 --> 17:27.004
I love this idea. You're an evil genius.

17:27.087 --> 17:31.425
Well, according to my SAT scores
I'm just evil, but thank you.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.929
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Dan's gonna figure out it's you.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.097
I know.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.100
-You're not scared of him?
-Oh, I'm terrified.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.895
But having you around makes it okay.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.024
Oh, no, don't get all excited,
I was talking to the hat.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.442
Of course.

18:16.762 --> 18:17.846
[elevator bell dings]

18:23.602 --> 18:27.314
-Sheila?
-Hi. Yep, it's me.

18:27.397 --> 18:30.609
What are you doing here?
And why are you dressed like that?

18:31.318 --> 18:32.861
Oh, this?

18:33.779 --> 18:39.827
I was just on my way
to a charity watermelon eating contest.

18:39.910 --> 18:40.994
The mayor's gonna be there.

18:42.412 --> 18:48.043
But how are you and what are you
doing here? And who is your friend?

18:48.127 --> 18:52.214
Oh. This is Bob,
the guy I'm having an affair with.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.258
And, Bob, this is Sheila.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.385
She's the one who told me
to have an affair.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.428
Oh. Hey, thank you so much.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.556
[chuckles] You're welcome.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.933
Actually, that wasn't at all
what I said, but...

19:03.851 --> 19:05.602
So, what do you do, Bob?

19:05.686 --> 19:08.313
-Me. In a doorway.
-Babe.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.149
[all laughing]

19:10.232 --> 19:12.609
That is true,
but that's not what pays the bills.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.279
-I'm a pediatric oncologist.
-Oh.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.156
Yeah, I was doing
my whole pharma rep thing

19:17.239 --> 19:19.074
and I stopped by his office upstairs...

19:19.158 --> 19:22.786
I didn't even really need her samples,
but I just didn't want her to leave.

19:22.870 --> 19:26.790
He donated them to a clinic
he volunteers at. Isn't he so sweet?

19:27.457 --> 19:30.919
-Oh, my God. You're a good person.
-[Bob] I was.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.088
-Till I met this hot cup of coffee.
-[laughs]

19:33.755 --> 19:36.008
Well, have fun with your watermelon.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.510
Hey, I'd love to make a donation.
What's your charity for?

19:39.469 --> 19:43.015
Blind... ness. They wanna stop it.

19:43.098 --> 19:47.519
Well, I don't have my checkbook,
but I do have... $200. Is that...?

19:47.603 --> 19:49.146
Oh, my God.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.232
[soul music playing]

19:52.316 --> 19:54.902
Are you sure you don't want
the other half of my Molly?

19:54.985 --> 19:56.153
It'll relax you.

19:56.236 --> 20:00.949
You've been a great hostess, Eva,
but no, thank you. I'd really like to go.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.912
Sorry, not until Marcus gets here.
He really wants to talk to you.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.246
[buzzing]

20:06.330 --> 20:07.998
Can I at least check my phone?

20:08.081 --> 20:10.918
My wife is doing this thing tonight
and I'm a little bit worried about her.

20:11.001 --> 20:15.130
Ah, you love her, that's sweet.
I'm rooting for Marcus not to hurt you.

20:15.756 --> 20:16.673
Me too.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.133
What you worried about?

20:18.217 --> 20:21.386
Little bit Marcus, but mostly
because this thing my wife is doing

20:21.470 --> 20:24.056
is kind of dangerous
and we usually do it together.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.767
Aww, you wanna be with her
because you love her.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.186
That's beautiful. Could I kiss your chest?

20:29.269 --> 20:30.562
I don't think so.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.065
-Can I rub your hair?
-I guess.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.823
You know, my man is always making me
do all this dangerous stuff by myself.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.493
-Really?
-Yeah. Why is he doing that to me, Joel?

20:44.576 --> 20:45.953
I don't know.

20:46.036 --> 20:49.248
Maybe he's not great at danger
and thinks he would just get in your way.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.875
You know, I never told him,
but I want him with me.

20:51.959 --> 20:56.129
-Having him there makes me feel better.
-Of course it does.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.883
And he should wanna make you feel better.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.387
He needs to stop only thinking
about himself,

21:03.470 --> 21:05.764
put his issues aside,
and be there for his wife.

21:05.847 --> 21:06.890
We're not even married.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.351
And I got a ton of shit
to say about that, too.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.269
[door opens]

21:11.019 --> 21:13.647
-What the fuck?
-Yo, this is Joel.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.524
And he didn't do nothing to Loki.

21:15.607 --> 21:18.235
And he says you need
to stop being a fucking pussy

21:18.318 --> 21:21.738
and come with me when I do my drops,
and fucking put a ring on it, Marcus!

21:23.532 --> 21:26.952
Marcus is your boyfriend?
Would've been good to know.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.039
And I didn't call you a pussy.
She was being hyperbolic.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.208
Oh, yeah, Eva's hyperbolic as shit.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.379
But if she says you're cool,
you can go.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.172
-Really?
-Nope.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.011
[groans]

21:46.596 --> 21:47.639
Huh.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.232
Excellent news. I got the pen.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.776
Oh, my God.
I was so worried about you. [sighs]

22:00.736 --> 22:03.196
-What are you wearing?
-Some of Loki's friends came by.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.949
We hung out for a while,
then they knocked me out.

22:06.033 --> 22:08.535
When I woke up, they were gone,
along with my money and phone,

22:08.618 --> 22:10.120
and for some reason all my clothes.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.706
-Which... [chuckles] I guess is funny.
-Oh, my God.

22:12.789 --> 22:15.834
Honey, thank God you're okay.

22:15.917 --> 22:18.170
How was your night
with the sex trafficker?

22:18.253 --> 22:20.213
A question I never thought
I'd ask my wife.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.632
Awful.
It turns out he wasn't a trafficker.

22:22.716 --> 22:26.928
He was Lisa's boyfriend.
A nice pediatrician who gave me $200.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.930
I almost killed an innocent man.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.850
And even if I find a worthy charity
to donate the money to,

22:31.933 --> 22:33.685
I'm still gonna get the tax write-off.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.605
-Oh, sweetheart, it's okay.
-Ohh.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.775
And I hated being there without you.
I was wrong.

22:39.858 --> 22:44.112
I don't wanna do this alone.
It was like when I gave birth to Abby.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.574
I did the messy parts,
but I needed you to get me through it.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.451
You're never gonna be alone again.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.328
As much as I complain
about Loki's friends,

22:51.411 --> 22:54.122
they made me realize
I want to be there for you.

22:55.415 --> 23:00.212
-I love that. Thank you, Loki's friends.
-No more doing things separately.

23:00.295 --> 23:04.007
From now on,
we fuck everything up together.

23:04.716 --> 23:05.926
Good.

23:06.009 --> 23:08.303
Now what are we gonna do about Dan?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.931
We have some stuff on him now.

23:11.014 --> 23:14.059
I'll go over there tomorrow
and tell him we're out.

23:16.269 --> 23:17.270
Thank you.

23:18.021 --> 23:22.776
You know, when I was about
to kill that guy today, I got the tingle.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.779
-Down there.
-I know where the tingle lives, honey.

23:25.862 --> 23:28.156
Then why don't you go visit it.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.950
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.034
I'd love to.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.756
-[Joel] Hey, Dan.
-Hey, buddy.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.886
-I knocked on your door, no one answered.
-So you trespassed. I could shoot you.

23:51.304 --> 23:54.141
[laughs] I'm just kidding!
Why would I shoot my friend?

23:56.393 --> 23:59.104
So you, uh, do that thing
we talked about yesterday?

24:00.188 --> 24:04.317
No, and I'm not going to. It's over, Dan.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.778
And if you turn me in,
I'll turn you in too.

24:06.862 --> 24:11.741
-Into what?
-No. I'll turn you in... too.

24:12.450 --> 24:14.327
In... to... what?

24:14.411 --> 24:16.163
I'll turn you in also.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.292
I have two files
with your fingerprints all over them.

24:20.375 --> 24:24.296
People you blackmailed me to kill,
including your wife's boyfriend.

24:25.505 --> 24:28.049
That's right. I know everything.

24:28.758 --> 24:33.180
Whoa, you hear that?
That's the sound of the tables turning.

24:34.055 --> 24:39.311
So let me get this straight:
you have a file on a guy who's not dead,

24:39.394 --> 24:44.232
and another file on an active case
that you must've stolen from my house?

24:45.609 --> 24:48.069
Well, that's another way of looking at it.

24:49.487 --> 24:50.947
Joel, you just had your little moment,

24:51.031 --> 24:53.325
but let me tell you
how this is gonna go down.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.620
You're gonna keep doing
what I tell you to, because if you don't,

24:56.703 --> 25:00.415
I'm not only gonna put you away,
I'm gonna put your wife away too.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.211
-She has nothing to do with this.
-Really?

25:04.294 --> 25:08.215
I saw her with you the night you sprayed
your lawn where you killed Gary.

25:08.298 --> 25:11.968
I can build off of that.
Or I'll just plant some evidence.

25:12.052 --> 25:15.305
I'm an LA Sheriff's Deputy,
it's literally what we do.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.016
You're the worst fucking neighbor.

25:18.099 --> 25:21.519
You know what'd be fun?
If I just arrested Sheila.

25:23.146 --> 25:26.107
What would you do then, Joel?
She's the one with the balls.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.194
She sells the houses.
She's the closer, isn't she?

25:30.278 --> 25:31.613
You know what you are?

25:32.530 --> 25:36.117
You're my bitch.
Because that's what <i>you're </i>good at.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.412
Unless I'm missing something.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.164
Is there anything else
you're good at, Joel?

25:42.165 --> 25:43.375
Anything at all?

25:47.837 --> 25:49.714
I'm pretty good with a shovel.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.426
[muffled explosion, hissing]

26:05.772 --> 26:08.775
[instrumental theme music playing]
