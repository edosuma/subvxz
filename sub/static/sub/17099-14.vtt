00:48.439 --> 00:50.871
What's this presentation
supposed to be about anyway?

00:50.991 --> 00:54.469
I don't know, Higgins, but if
Detective Murdoch invited us,

00:54.470 --> 00:56.306
I'm sure it's something worthwhile.

00:56.359 --> 00:58.585
It's probably about
fingermarks or something boring.

00:59.317 --> 01:02.174
Higgins, fingermarks have allowed us

01:02.208 --> 01:03.969
to catch more criminals than you...

01:04.022 --> 01:06.308
Oh, shh, there's the Detective now.

01:07.310 --> 01:08.836
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:09.205 --> 01:13.327
You are about to be the first to witness

01:13.447 --> 01:17.838
the most revolutionary
development in human history.

01:18.234 --> 01:21.146
- I knew it. Fingermarks.
- That's right,

01:21.193 --> 01:23.800
an invention so incredible

01:24.037 --> 01:29.710
that it will irrevocably change
life on Earth as we know it.

01:30.449 --> 01:33.377
But before I get too far,

01:33.838 --> 01:37.993
allow me to pay tribute to
the man who's creation it is,

01:38.510 --> 01:42.093
a man who unfortunately
cannot be with us here, today,

01:42.213 --> 01:46.664
due to his... most unfortunate demise.

01:47.115 --> 01:49.515
That's right, none of us
would be able to be here today

01:49.548 --> 01:51.457
were it not for the brilliance

01:51.733 --> 01:54.624
of the late James Pendrick.

01:55.410 --> 01:58.301
- Late?
- Is Mr. Pendrick dead?

01:58.421 --> 02:01.339
If he's dead and the Inspector
was traveling with him, then...

02:01.393 --> 02:04.526
James Pendrick was an
inventor of the highest order.

02:04.810 --> 02:06.469
Before he expired,

02:06.589 --> 02:08.687
he had nearly perfected

02:08.808 --> 02:11.586
a powerful potion of guarana.

02:12.056 --> 02:15.700
Sadly, it was left incomplete.

02:15.916 --> 02:17.434
Until now.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.660
But I, William Murdoch,

02:20.780 --> 02:24.271
have taken that dream to reality.

02:29.742 --> 02:32.922
I have created an additive...

02:35.154 --> 02:38.361
... which will unlock

02:38.414 --> 02:40.888
Mr. Pendrick's formulation.

02:43.167 --> 02:44.787
The result...

02:45.991 --> 02:49.353
will be the most incredible innovation

02:49.393 --> 02:53.843
the world has ever seen... "Pendrimine!"

02:54.623 --> 02:57.352
My God!

02:57.352 --> 03:00.337
- He hasn't even told us what it does yet.
- Now,

03:00.734 --> 03:04.511
some of you may know
my friend and colleague,

03:04.631 --> 03:07.038
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

03:07.872 --> 03:09.574
Now, as you can see,

03:10.164 --> 03:13.653
his best days have passed behind him.

03:13.773 --> 03:16.376
Time had taken its toll.

03:16.389 --> 03:19.912
But, after imbibing

03:20.362 --> 03:23.724
just one dose of Pendrimine,

03:24.389 --> 03:27.381
this is him today!

03:31.091 --> 03:32.806
- It can't be...
- That's right!

03:32.926 --> 03:34.668
I'm a young man again!

03:34.788 --> 03:38.661
James Pendrick has given me the
gift of eternal bloody youth!

03:48.947 --> 03:51.421
It was like nothing
I'd ever experienced.

03:51.461 --> 03:53.297
I could feel myself changing.

03:53.310 --> 03:55.926
In a matter of minutes it
was done. I was young again.

03:56.046 --> 04:00.511
Sir, how do we actually
know that... you're you?

04:00.551 --> 04:03.004
Bloody hell, Higgins,
who else would I be?

04:04.174 --> 04:08.059
- So, sir, what happens now?
- Will you ever grow old again?

04:08.113 --> 04:10.772
Not if I keep drinking
the stuff, Crabtree.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.793
OY!

04:12.827 --> 04:14.627
You'll get yours in due time!

04:14.654 --> 04:16.415
Besides, this is only the additive

04:16.442 --> 04:18.983
won't do a thing without
Pendrick's formula.

04:19.024 --> 04:22.062
So... where is the actual formula, then?

04:22.083 --> 04:24.691
Ah, Murdoch's squirreled it
away where it can't be touched.

04:24.704 --> 04:26.533
So, how did all this come to pass?

04:26.559 --> 04:28.610
I mean, what happened in Panama?

04:28.644 --> 04:30.580
What happened to James Pendrick?

04:30.700 --> 04:32.409
Agh, we journeyed south

04:32.443 --> 04:34.648
and reclaimed his stolen
formula from Ashmi.

04:34.768 --> 04:37.115
As he toiled, I adventured,

04:37.148 --> 04:39.508
in search of the critical ingredient:

04:39.569 --> 04:42.023
the super guarana of Panama.

04:42.056 --> 04:44.160
But one day I returned

04:44.174 --> 04:45.969
to a commotion in our laboratory.

04:46.433 --> 04:49.753
We'd been ransacked,
the formula stolen and...

04:49.753 --> 04:52.899
James Pendrick was dead.

04:55.716 --> 04:59.077
Now, I must remind
you to prepare yourself

04:59.111 --> 05:00.610
for a bit of a shock.

05:00.630 --> 05:02.446
Where has Thomas been all this time,

05:02.486 --> 05:04.019
and why didn't he come home

05:04.052 --> 05:05.115
when he came back from Panama?

05:05.235 --> 05:07.885
We've had to keep him
under close observation.

05:07.918 --> 05:11.518
I remind you this is a highly
experimental drug, Mrs. Brackenreid.

05:11.552 --> 05:14.164
We all will, Crabtree.

05:15.159 --> 05:17.081
Margaret!

05:19.488 --> 05:21.982
- No...
- It's true, Margaret.

05:22.036 --> 05:23.616
- It's me.
- Ah...

05:23.636 --> 05:26.540
I don't believe it. You're
not Thomas. Look at you!

05:26.547 --> 05:28.668
I am, Margaret. I swear it.

05:28.788 --> 05:31.538
- Impossible.
- Let me prove it.

05:31.572 --> 05:34.614
- Ask me anything. Go on.
- Uh...

05:35.209 --> 05:36.704
Alright.

05:36.824 --> 05:38.926
Where were you when John was born?

05:38.943 --> 05:40.724
I was right here, in Station Four,

05:40.724 --> 05:43.931
trapped under three feet of
snow. But when I heard the news,

05:43.964 --> 05:45.800
I dug my way out with a latrine bucket,

05:45.820 --> 05:48.778
and was there before the
midwife handed him back to you.

05:48.818 --> 05:52.425
Oh, Thomas! It really is you!

05:53.195 --> 05:54.459
Ah...

05:54.579 --> 05:56.139
- Ooh...
- Ooh...

05:58.223 --> 05:59.877
Sir.

05:59.898 --> 06:02.956
Another message for you. This
one couriered over locally.

06:05.605 --> 06:07.354
"Mr. X."

06:07.474 --> 06:09.843
Must be another potential buyer.

06:10.405 --> 06:12.079
Word is spreading, George.

06:12.086 --> 06:15.649
People from all over the world
are interested in my Pendrimine.

06:15.850 --> 06:18.332
I'll be inviting them all
to a special meeting soon

06:18.358 --> 06:20.737
to entertain their official offers.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.207
Sir...

06:24.691 --> 06:26.983
I don't mean to speak
out of turn, but...

06:27.649 --> 06:29.625
it seems to me that you're not...

06:30.177 --> 06:32.926
overly concerned with
Mr. Pendrick's murder.

06:33.451 --> 06:35.797
Well, what can we do from here, George?

06:35.917 --> 06:38.170
We know nothing of the circumstances,

06:38.445 --> 06:41.477
we have no access to the
body, to the police report...

06:41.597 --> 06:45.357
We have little choice but to leave
the investigation to the Panamanians.

06:46.714 --> 06:48.379
Yes, I suppose so.

06:49.686 --> 06:53.386
Although, it also surprises
me somewhat that you seem...

06:53.988 --> 06:57.639
so intent on... selling
the Pendrimine. Only because

06:57.759 --> 07:00.021
I've tried to monetize
your inventions in the past,

07:00.027 --> 07:01.500
you've always declined.

07:02.329 --> 07:04.647
This one is different, George.

07:05.077 --> 07:09.009
Alone, I could create a few
doses of Pendrimine a month.

07:09.444 --> 07:11.902
But someone with sufficient capital

07:11.918 --> 07:14.511
could make enough for the entire world!

07:16.178 --> 07:19.820
- So it's not really the money that you're after.
- Not in the least.

07:20.105 --> 07:21.487
The bidding will begin

07:21.530 --> 07:23.605
at one hundred million dollars.

07:26.397 --> 07:29.070
Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please.

07:29.452 --> 07:31.410
Consider what's on offer here.

07:32.125 --> 07:34.663
Most would give their entire fortunes

07:34.706 --> 07:37.094
in exchange for eternal youth!

07:37.380 --> 07:40.482
And I am not just selling one dose, no.

07:40.701 --> 07:42.951
The formula itself,

07:43.306 --> 07:44.812
to one buyer.

07:45.091 --> 07:47.550
The value is limitless.

07:47.980 --> 07:49.792
I await your bids.

08:01.576 --> 08:04.540
Henry, have you noticed something
about the Detective is different?

08:04.583 --> 08:05.889
The Detective?

08:06.353 --> 08:08.052
Yes. He's not himself.

08:08.407 --> 08:10.279
The Detective, not the Inspector?

08:10.639 --> 08:12.339
No, the Inspector seems fine.

08:12.566 --> 08:13.984
He's thirty years younger.

08:14.017 --> 08:16.152
Well that's just because
he's taken the Pendrimine.

08:16.201 --> 08:18.110
He still acts like the Inspector.

08:18.159 --> 08:20.751
To me, the Detective is acting
like somebody else altogether.

08:21.386 --> 08:23.721
- I don't know what to say to that, George.
- Well,

08:24.078 --> 08:26.524
I've got proof. Look.

08:27.185 --> 08:29.282
Detective Murdoch told
me he didn't know anything

08:29.292 --> 08:32.250
about the police investigation
in Panama into Pendrick's death.

08:32.298 --> 08:35.078
I found this police report in his files.

08:35.116 --> 08:37.772
- You went through his files?
- Unfortunately, it's in Spanish,

08:37.794 --> 08:40.188
I can't make out a word of it.
You don't speak Spanish, do you?

08:40.221 --> 08:42.645
You stole this from the Detective?

08:42.765 --> 08:44.712
Well he wasn't doing anything with it.

08:44.792 --> 08:48.122
I'm telling you, Detective Murdoch
has become a money-hungry madman

08:48.144 --> 08:49.832
who's turned his back on the law!

08:50.015 --> 08:52.140
He's still our boss, George.

08:53.775 --> 08:55.850
Now remember,

08:55.877 --> 08:58.830
- this is strictly off the record.
- Si, claro.

08:59.513 --> 09:01.606
How do you know how to
speak Spanish, anyway?

09:01.622 --> 09:03.408
Te lo dije: soy castellana!

09:03.430 --> 09:05.812
CrecÃ¬a hablando
español todos los dias.

09:05.849 --> 09:08.963
Y mi abuela no hablÃ²
una palabra de Ingles.

09:10.367 --> 09:12.013
My grandmother is Spanish.

09:12.061 --> 09:14.375
- Ah.
- Come on, vamos a ver.

09:15.058 --> 09:18.452
Panama City police report.

09:18.667 --> 09:21.646
Dr. James Pendrick. Homicide.

09:22.356 --> 09:25.852
Inyectado con veneno... he was poisoned.

09:25.972 --> 09:27.208
Poisoned with what?

09:28.014 --> 09:29.450
No identificado.

09:29.677 --> 09:31.596
- Unidentified.
- Muy bien.

09:32.128 --> 09:34.748
It says here he had
a number of symptoms:

09:34.782 --> 09:38.754
vomiting, convulsions,
excessive slavering,

09:38.786 --> 09:41.276
and near instant hair loss.

09:41.396 --> 09:43.745
He was believed to be dead
within ten to twenty minutes.

09:43.772 --> 09:46.822
My God! What kind of
poison does all that?

09:47.763 --> 09:49.763
The case remains open.

09:49.797 --> 09:52.092
But they were able to trace the man

09:52.130 --> 09:53.953
they believe was the
murderer back to a ship

09:54.073 --> 09:57.401
which fled Panama under the alias...

09:57.675 --> 10:00.881
- "P.D. Lion."
- P.D. Lion?

10:01.295 --> 10:03.586
Oh! P.D. Lion!

10:03.759 --> 10:06.379
- That's quite clever.
- How so?

10:06.728 --> 10:09.115
Lion in Spanish is Leon.

10:09.352 --> 10:12.246
P.D. Leon. Ponce de Leon. Of course.

10:12.366 --> 10:13.773
If you're gonna chase
the fountain of youth,

10:13.806 --> 10:15.596
you might as well name
yourself after the most famous

10:15.623 --> 10:17.511
fountain hunter in history.

10:19.259 --> 10:21.319
Don't worry, I won't write anything.

10:21.929 --> 10:23.669
I'll save this one for my memoirs.

10:24.115 --> 10:26.105
No, it's not that, it's just...

10:26.955 --> 10:29.337
I have no idea what I'm
going to do with this.

10:29.735 --> 10:31.677
Detective Murdoch lied to me.

10:35.776 --> 10:38.921
- Dr. Ogden.
- Oh, George!

10:38.970 --> 10:41.557
What a pleasant surprise!
What can I help you with?

10:41.677 --> 10:43.934
It's a personal matter.
It's about the Detective.

10:43.989 --> 10:46.527
- Oh?
- Have you noticed that he's been...

10:46.549 --> 10:48.465
acting strange lately?

10:49.186 --> 10:50.923
Not particularly.

10:51.687 --> 10:52.925
Perhaps a small shift.

10:52.952 --> 10:55.404
We have recently learned
that we'll live forever.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.372
Rather a big revelation in one's life!

10:57.372 --> 10:59.943
Right, it's just he seems very...

10:59.997 --> 11:01.986
focused on selling this Pendrimine.

11:02.389 --> 11:05.863
Yes. To a buyer who can
deliver it to the world.

11:06.192 --> 11:07.611
Right, yes, he did say that.

11:08.128 --> 11:09.424
Thank you, Doctor.

11:09.643 --> 11:11.878
Um, while I have you,

11:12.059 --> 11:15.517
do you know of a poison
that could cause hair loss,

11:15.539 --> 11:18.201
- vomiting, and convulsions?
- Uh...

11:18.255 --> 11:21.331
Oh, and excessive saliva.

11:22.176 --> 11:24.719
I can't say that I do.

11:29.259 --> 11:32.690
- He asked about the symptoms?
- He knows something.

11:32.916 --> 11:34.439
It could be a problem.

11:34.977 --> 11:37.924
If all goes according to
plan, it will be over tonight.

12:37.636 --> 12:39.465
Wait!

12:39.500 --> 12:41.444
Toronto Constabulary!

12:42.854 --> 12:45.575
- Sir, are you all right?
- What's going on?

12:45.967 --> 12:48.270
- George?
- Sir? I was just...

12:48.313 --> 12:49.743
Bloody hell, Crabtree.

12:49.786 --> 12:52.755
You just let James
Pendrick's killer get away!

12:59.808 --> 13:01.351
I don't understand.

13:01.566 --> 13:03.583
If you're both the Inspector, then

13:03.583 --> 13:06.524
- who took the Pendrimine?
- No one, George.

13:06.868 --> 13:10.283
This man isn't the Inspector.
The Pendrimine is a ruse.

13:10.531 --> 13:12.612
It doesn't work? At all?

13:14.032 --> 13:15.655
I'd best start at the beginning.

13:15.775 --> 13:18.658
Everything you heard about
what happened in Panama is true.

13:18.952 --> 13:21.733
We caught Ashmi and resumed
work on the formulation.

13:22.158 --> 13:24.793
Then there was an attack.
James' work was stolen.

13:24.999 --> 13:27.434
- So he really was killed.
- Poisoned.

13:28.278 --> 13:30.092
I tried to save him.

13:31.138 --> 13:32.813
He died in my arms.

13:33.141 --> 13:35.212
Murdered for a potion
that doesn't even work.

13:36.519 --> 13:38.244
So why pretend that it did?

13:38.279 --> 13:41.112
That was my idea. After the attack,

13:41.612 --> 13:43.892
I thought I'd track the
killer down as best I could.

13:44.155 --> 13:45.968
But he fled the country using an alias.

13:45.986 --> 13:49.194
- P.D. Lion.
- Precisely.

13:49.565 --> 13:52.125
I found out that he'd traveled
to Toronto, so I followed.

13:52.159 --> 13:54.561
On the boat, I met this actor.

13:54.954 --> 13:57.864
Very good looking young lad.
The best mimic I'd ever heard.

13:58.079 --> 14:00.640
Quinton Prout. Good
to meet you, Constable.

14:00.845 --> 14:02.366
Yes, you as well.

14:02.485 --> 14:04.330
The Inspector's plan was simple.

14:04.588 --> 14:07.718
Pretend that I'd created
the key "additive."

14:07.788 --> 14:11.505
And that the formula that the
thief stole actually worked.

14:12.516 --> 14:15.646
Pendrimine as a whole would
be valuable to everyone.

14:16.496 --> 14:18.206
But the additive alone

14:18.243 --> 14:20.061
would only be worth
something to the person

14:20.078 --> 14:22.896
- who'd stolen the formula.
- Pendrick's killer.

14:22.923 --> 14:25.170
One of the buyers sent
a messenger to tell me

14:25.192 --> 14:28.193
that he was intent on seeing
the additive in person.

14:28.403 --> 14:30.683
- We were to meet him tonight.
- Ambush him,

14:30.710 --> 14:32.038
and when he made a grab for it,

14:32.496 --> 14:33.926
we were to arrest him.

14:34.259 --> 14:36.269
And I scared him off.

14:36.303 --> 14:37.950
Hm...

14:38.358 --> 14:40.843
All we can hope for now
is that he'll resurface.

14:40.891 --> 14:44.290
I'll find him. I can track
down that motorized bicycle.

14:44.338 --> 14:46.412
I'll do it first thing
tomorrow, I swear.

14:51.085 --> 14:53.789
- Hey, George.
- Samuel. I could use some help.

14:54.106 --> 14:55.386
I could use some myself.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.844
Business has really picked up
since we've been in the paper.

14:57.964 --> 15:01.140
Listen, I'm looking for
an electric motorized

15:01.156 --> 15:05.419
bicycle. Unusual design. Thick
wheels, brass trimmed battery packs...

15:05.539 --> 15:08.081
Ah, you haven't seen anything
like that around here. But...

15:08.113 --> 15:10.447
I do know a man who knows every
motorized bicycle in the city.

15:10.635 --> 15:13.273
- I'll get back to you in an hour?
- I'll be at Station House Four.

15:13.307 --> 15:16.158
Oh, George. Nina left this for you.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.401
Some of your things, I gather?

15:19.600 --> 15:20.746
How is she?

15:21.402 --> 15:23.596
She's well, as far as I can see.

15:25.129 --> 15:26.517
Right.

15:30.991 --> 15:32.084
Higgins!

15:32.579 --> 15:34.542
The stables are a right mess.

15:34.575 --> 15:37.511
- Get out there!
- Sir, perhaps you've forgotten,

15:37.516 --> 15:39.603
- but I'm a Constable First Class.
- I haven't forgotten

15:39.636 --> 15:41.911
a bloody thing, Higgins! Go!

15:42.653 --> 15:43.783
Sir.

15:44.025 --> 15:46.794
Oh Thomas... I packed us a lunch.

15:46.807 --> 15:49.688
I thought maybe we could take
it to the park for a picnic.

15:49.710 --> 15:53.210
Or perhaps dine in your office.

15:53.247 --> 15:54.883
Draw the blinds...

15:56.125 --> 15:58.621
Well, it's a lovely day
for the park, sweetheart.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.731
Detective Murdoch.

16:09.851 --> 16:12.463
My name is Tanner.
Canadian Intelligence.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.458
What can I do for you, Mr. Tanner?

16:14.485 --> 16:16.970
The Prime Minister has
heard tell of your invention.

16:17.004 --> 16:19.008
He has sent me to obtain it on behalf

16:19.041 --> 16:20.896
of the federal government of Canada.

16:21.016 --> 16:23.477
Well, you are more than
welcome to make a bid for it.

16:23.493 --> 16:25.878
Hm. Think this through, Detective.

16:25.913 --> 16:28.064
Capitalism has its limits.

16:28.282 --> 16:31.584
Even the wealthiest company in
the world could not pay your price.

16:31.619 --> 16:34.390
With all due respect, Agent Tanner...

16:34.622 --> 16:38.031
- Hm
- ... my formula will change life as we know it.

16:38.541 --> 16:40.701
- No price is too high.
- Oh, I agree.

16:40.731 --> 16:43.984
Can you imagine if, say, the Americans

16:44.243 --> 16:45.563
were to live forever?

16:46.425 --> 16:50.436
Their eternal strength
would render Canada helpless.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.955
Our nation would be
cast into grave peril.

16:55.568 --> 16:56.751
Hm!

16:57.418 --> 16:58.859
Very well, then.

16:58.979 --> 17:02.780
- What's Canada's offer?
- Canada's offer is zero.

17:03.065 --> 17:06.400
We simply hope that you
will do the right thing.

17:06.814 --> 17:10.477
It would be a shame if you were
to be convicted of... treason.

17:11.472 --> 17:13.457
Good day.

17:16.839 --> 17:19.898
"Nina, you'll be in my
heart until the day I die.

17:19.933 --> 17:22.660
Or, if I turn into a mummy, much longer.

17:22.696 --> 17:24.251
Love, George."

17:24.771 --> 17:26.779
- What's all this?
- Uh, what's what?

17:26.843 --> 17:29.909
- The book. Worth reading?
- Oh, no, it's nothing really.

17:30.623 --> 17:32.613
"By George Crabtree?!"

17:32.909 --> 17:34.593
George, have you written a novel?

17:34.878 --> 17:38.484
- Well, yes I did actually.
- "The Curse of the Pharaohs."

17:38.648 --> 17:40.504
Sounds marvelous, I'll read it tonight.

17:40.521 --> 17:42.907
No, I really don't think you'd
like it. I mean, it's full of...

17:42.924 --> 17:44.290
flights of fancy, which...

17:44.553 --> 17:46.569
- which really is its strength, but...
- Perfect!

17:46.575 --> 17:48.382
I just finished the
interminable new Henry James,

17:48.392 --> 17:51.318
- I need something more lively.
- I don't know...

17:51.438 --> 17:53.689
George, do you not want me to read it?

17:54.463 --> 17:56.308
Come on, I won't be mean.

17:56.835 --> 17:59.105
Of course I want you to read it.

17:59.132 --> 18:02.940
I would like to get you a new
copy, this is... very worn. It's...

18:03.204 --> 18:05.845
Fine. But get it for me soon, will you?

18:05.879 --> 18:07.356
I don't like the idea
of spending a night

18:07.388 --> 18:09.313
without George Crabtree by my bedside.

18:15.681 --> 18:18.746
I'm not quite sure how
to say this, Inspector.

18:18.763 --> 18:21.151
- It's about your wife.
- Margaret?

18:21.271 --> 18:23.495
- Has she figured it out?
- No, sir,

18:23.533 --> 18:25.980
- quite to the contrary.
- How's that?

18:26.475 --> 18:28.319
Well, last night

18:28.325 --> 18:30.600
she expected I would
be doing the same things

18:30.621 --> 18:33.079
you yourself would do
upon your return home.

18:33.106 --> 18:34.795
Ah. The gate needs mending.

18:35.091 --> 18:37.156
Yes, no I've seen to the gate.

18:37.188 --> 18:39.078
But there were other,

18:39.113 --> 18:41.959
shall we say, expectations...

18:43.089 --> 18:46.353
She was rather insistent
that I resume my...

18:46.380 --> 18:50.463
or rather, that I resume your, uh...

18:51.172 --> 18:52.286
Ahem!

18:52.512 --> 18:54.932
- ... husbandly duties.
- Did you?

18:55.052 --> 18:57.089
- No!
- Well then, what's the problem?

18:57.126 --> 18:59.732
Well, she was rather demanding, sir.

19:00.020 --> 19:02.368
A woman has needs, Mr. Prout.

19:02.548 --> 19:05.247
- And Margaret is very much a woman.
- Oh!

19:05.301 --> 19:07.824
I'm not sure I can keep
her at bay much longer.

19:08.146 --> 19:09.733
Have an extra whiskey with supper.

19:09.738 --> 19:10.813
Once she's clearing the dishes,

19:10.831 --> 19:12.607
go straight to the
bedroom and start snoring.

19:12.616 --> 19:14.048
It always works for me!

19:15.313 --> 19:18.045
Sir. Sirs. No. Sir.

19:18.695 --> 19:20.480
We have an address for the motorbike.

19:20.528 --> 19:22.030
Right. then. Let's get to it.

19:22.043 --> 19:24.475
- Actually, sir, I wasn't sent to fetch you.
- What?

19:24.491 --> 19:26.759
You're to stay in hiding just
in case this isn't our man.

19:26.794 --> 19:29.428
We can't risk exposing
the ruse. Mr. Prout.

19:29.659 --> 19:30.918
Ahem!

19:33.660 --> 19:35.236
Bollocks.

19:36.381 --> 19:38.016
Let's hope this is our man.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.339
I don't care much for
being accused of treason.

19:40.459 --> 19:43.975
- Sir, it is a hangable offense.
- Thank you, George.

19:44.195 --> 19:47.191
This should be it.

19:50.557 --> 19:53.693
You there! Stop! Toronto Constabulary!

19:59.910 --> 20:02.061
Who are you? Identify yourself.

20:03.653 --> 20:04.730
You!

20:05.003 --> 20:07.800
- Pendrick's assistant.
- The name is Ashmi,

20:08.154 --> 20:09.547
Detective.

20:11.144 --> 20:14.403
When did you last see Mr. Pendrick?

20:14.435 --> 20:16.146
When he found me in Panama.

20:16.705 --> 20:19.645
He and your Inspector
reclaimed what I had stolen.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.960
I stayed for a time but
could not regain James' trust.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.216
I returned to Canada some weeks ago.

20:25.259 --> 20:27.028
Then why were you after the additive?

20:27.050 --> 20:30.432
And you specifically requested
that our Inspector bring it to you.

20:30.508 --> 20:32.267
- Alone.
- But while in Panama

20:32.283 --> 20:33.886
I heard tell of a man.

20:34.006 --> 20:36.329
Another who was after James' work.

20:36.639 --> 20:38.618
I'd hoped to sell it to him.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.100
You believe this man stole the formula?

20:41.134 --> 20:44.068
- That he killed Mr. Pendrick?
- Who is this man?

20:44.396 --> 20:45.902
He came from Asia.

20:45.977 --> 20:47.967
Or possibly the skies themselves.

20:47.972 --> 20:49.634
Some called him a God.

20:49.924 --> 20:52.920
Have you ever heard the name P.D. Lion?

20:53.614 --> 20:55.882
The man of whom I speak had no name.

20:55.916 --> 20:57.883
- Only a letter.
- A letter?

20:58.674 --> 21:01.320
They called him Senor Equis.

21:01.675 --> 21:04.241
George, the card we received.

21:05.574 --> 21:06.817
Mr. X.

21:07.339 --> 21:08.861
He's tried to contact us.

21:08.896 --> 21:11.248
Sir, we have an address.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.529
Mr. X?

21:18.841 --> 21:20.460
Senor Equis?

21:26.128 --> 21:27.645
Gentlemen.

21:28.361 --> 21:30.283
What took you so long?

21:38.058 --> 21:40.220
Terrence Meyers?

21:41.645 --> 21:44.962
The great rocket shook us and
blastered throught the atmosphere.

21:45.559 --> 21:48.808
The azure globe shimmering beneath me,

21:49.195 --> 21:53.260
vast oceans roiling, entire
continents within my view.

21:54.099 --> 21:57.934
I had flown higher than any
living thing ever had. It was the

21:57.956 --> 22:01.167
greatest adventure ever known to man.

22:02.264 --> 22:04.462
And then, nothing.

22:05.285 --> 22:06.909
Blackness.

22:07.990 --> 22:10.610
Not only had I touched
the face of God...

22:11.250 --> 22:13.359
I became God.

22:16.075 --> 22:17.217
God?

22:17.337 --> 22:20.523
Hm. I recall nothing of the descent.

22:20.899 --> 22:25.058
All I know is I awoke to the
smiling faces of the Murut.

22:25.836 --> 22:27.875
I was now in Sabah,

22:27.995 --> 22:30.150
near the village of Nabawan.

22:30.892 --> 22:34.075
And in that village,
I was no longer human.

22:34.435 --> 22:36.372
I was Ranying.

22:37.114 --> 22:40.218
Supreme God, fallen from above.

22:40.954 --> 22:42.713
Good Lord!

22:43.244 --> 22:45.424
These people believed you to be God.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.663
I tried to convince them otherwise,

22:48.673 --> 22:50.599
but these people had
not seen a tin opener,

22:50.636 --> 22:52.852
let alone a flying
rocket. I had, after all,

22:52.884 --> 22:54.717
descended upon them as if...

22:54.922 --> 22:56.702
by magic. I...

22:57.885 --> 23:01.209
I lived among the Murut
for many, many months.

23:01.827 --> 23:06.324
My soul, purified. My
mind, cleared. My powers...

23:06.613 --> 23:07.867
limitless.

23:08.486 --> 23:11.487
My... tumpas, my tattoos,

23:11.869 --> 23:13.880
symbols of my status.

23:14.499 --> 23:17.210
Then how did you end up in Panama?

23:17.244 --> 23:19.237
I was en route to America when...

23:19.285 --> 23:20.920
word came from the Prime Minister.

23:20.953 --> 23:23.378
Rumours had surfaced about
the possible existence

23:23.868 --> 23:25.427
of a "Fountain of Youth"

23:25.444 --> 23:28.731
invented by none other
than James Pendrick.

23:30.554 --> 23:32.544
But now, thanks to you, Murdoch,

23:32.737 --> 23:35.710
eternal life may be Canada's after all.

23:35.830 --> 23:39.099
Mr. Meyers, the Pendrimine
doesn't actually do anything.

23:39.133 --> 23:40.509
- You see...
- You see,

23:41.058 --> 23:45.091
it's useless unless
it is mixed properly.

23:45.366 --> 23:47.796
The Pendrimine has no effect

23:47.802 --> 23:51.271
unless it is combined with my additive

23:51.491 --> 23:54.447
using specialized equipment, of course.

23:54.804 --> 23:56.396
What equipment?

23:57.187 --> 23:59.532
Chemical synthesizers that can be found

23:59.569 --> 24:01.952
in James Pendrick's
laboratory, here, in Toronto.

24:02.689 --> 24:03.920
I see.

24:04.668 --> 24:07.330
Well, hand it all over.

24:07.820 --> 24:09.944
The Canadian government insists on it.

24:10.261 --> 24:11.461
I will.

24:11.670 --> 24:13.199
But not yet.

24:13.234 --> 24:16.369
Murdoch, you can't sell it.

24:16.404 --> 24:18.845
My only aim is to find and apprehend

24:18.888 --> 24:20.689
James Pendrick's killer.

24:21.017 --> 24:23.297
After that, the Pendrimine is yours.

24:23.911 --> 24:25.718
Bloody Meyers. I thought he was dead!

24:25.750 --> 24:28.449
It seems Pendrick's rocket was
safer than it appeared to be.

24:28.471 --> 24:31.063
Why did you lie to Mr. Meyers?

24:31.085 --> 24:33.172
Why would you tell him
the truth about anything?

24:33.387 --> 24:36.523
- The man is quite strange.
- Oh, those tattoos!

24:36.557 --> 24:39.829
Why write a cryptic note when he
could have called on us directly?

24:39.949 --> 24:42.443
Maybe he's not working
for the government at all.

24:42.563 --> 24:45.532
Still, it doesn't hurt to
have him in step with our goal.

24:45.566 --> 24:46.956
He now believes the only way

24:46.972 --> 24:49.140
to get the Pendrimine
is to work with us.

24:49.213 --> 24:51.515
It may be our only hope
of catching the killer.

24:51.635 --> 24:53.297
Well, let's do it quickly.

24:53.574 --> 24:56.009
I can't keep Margaret in the
dark about this much longer.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.245
The woman has needs.

25:00.816 --> 25:03.608
China. Japan. Russia. America.

25:03.973 --> 25:06.619
And of course, the Ottoman Empire.

25:06.654 --> 25:08.593
An international agent
from any one of those

25:08.604 --> 25:10.185
governments could be your killer.

25:10.305 --> 25:13.660
How exactly do we know
that the killer is a spy?

25:14.369 --> 25:16.730
Have you identified the
poison that killed him?

25:16.764 --> 25:19.672
No. Its symptoms are not known to...

25:20.118 --> 25:21.694
Polonium.

25:22.036 --> 25:24.904
Its devastating effects were
discovered by the Germans.

25:24.939 --> 25:27.588
Highly radioactive.
Unclear why it's so deadly.

25:28.239 --> 25:30.870
And this poison is only
known to the spy community?

25:30.897 --> 25:34.323
- Exactly.
- Mr. Meyers.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.716
I've been looking for you.

25:38.619 --> 25:40.137
Busy doing your job for you, Tanner.

25:40.158 --> 25:42.713
You know you're not supposed to
go anywhere without my knowledge.

25:44.127 --> 25:45.354
Dismissed.

25:45.474 --> 25:46.876
Ah!

25:57.605 --> 25:59.030
Detective.

26:00.106 --> 26:02.623
I must warn you that that is not

26:02.645 --> 26:04.839
the Terrence Meyers of old.

26:05.608 --> 26:08.158
The man I admired as a trainee was

26:08.190 --> 26:10.933
lost somewhere in the Bornean jungle.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.670
But he's returned.

26:12.734 --> 26:14.746
- He asked to be brought back.
- Hm.

26:14.772 --> 26:16.386
Is that what he told you?

26:17.160 --> 26:20.689
The moment Terrence Meyers
disappeared into low earth orbit,

26:20.705 --> 26:22.643
the government began its search.

26:22.763 --> 26:25.598
Meyers knows far, far too much.

26:26.739 --> 26:29.595
- You were the one who found him.
- Yes. Eventually.

26:29.644 --> 26:32.973
Only he did not want to be retrieved.

26:33.344 --> 26:35.842
He had become one of the savages.

26:36.533 --> 26:39.412
Meyers cannot be trusted.

26:39.717 --> 26:43.116
Eternal life is at
stake, as well you know.

26:43.701 --> 26:46.085
Put your faith where it belongs:

26:46.120 --> 26:49.088
in the capable hands of
the Canadian government.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.622
- Mr. Tanner...
- I already know you

26:51.659 --> 26:53.133
intend to hand over
the Pendrimine as soon

26:53.144 --> 26:55.866
as you have caught your killer. Oh,

26:55.898 --> 26:58.832
I have microphones in Meyers' room.

26:59.260 --> 27:00.529
Of course.

27:00.551 --> 27:02.869
Yes, well, I have confidence

27:03.035 --> 27:04.611
that you will find your man.

27:04.885 --> 27:06.482
If you don't trust me, well,

27:06.602 --> 27:09.623
you can take it straight to
the Prime Minister himself.

27:12.017 --> 27:14.581
So Terrence Meyers is alive.

27:14.932 --> 27:17.126
I never expected to see him again.

27:17.707 --> 27:20.887
I fear the old Terrence
Meyers may be gone forever.

27:21.164 --> 27:23.606
Julia, the man is deranged.

27:23.982 --> 27:26.725
Do you believe his theory
about Pendrick's killer?

27:27.069 --> 27:29.027
I have no reason to doubt it.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.474
So you'll work with him?

27:30.673 --> 27:32.404
I don't see the harm in it.

27:32.589 --> 27:35.783
So long as I don't allow him
to skew our investigation.

27:36.466 --> 27:40.206
Although, truth be told, nothing
we've tried thus far has worked.

27:41.515 --> 27:44.611
If the killer is a spy,
they may sense a trap.

27:46.006 --> 27:47.572
You may be right.

27:48.266 --> 27:50.048
And if that is the case,

27:50.384 --> 27:52.809
we need to make him feel desperate.

27:55.789 --> 27:58.506
We give the Pendrimine to
the government of Canada.

27:58.936 --> 28:01.054
Wonderful. Hand it over.

28:01.093 --> 28:03.360
At least that's what we
want the killer to believe.

28:04.049 --> 28:05.290
I see.

28:05.318 --> 28:07.121
If the killer thinks that Canada

28:07.123 --> 28:08.609
has the key to eternal youth,

28:08.620 --> 28:11.154
he'll be desperate to
get it for his country.

28:11.154 --> 28:13.706
Lest his nation be
left behind and so on.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.261
And if he's more desperate,

28:16.277 --> 28:18.635
he'll be more likely to make
a mistake, I see that, but

28:19.039 --> 28:21.026
why lie about it? Just give it to us,

28:21.066 --> 28:24.484
- the result is the same.
- I can't do that until the killer is caught.

28:24.748 --> 28:26.655
And how exactly are we supposed to prove

28:26.683 --> 28:28.214
the Canadian government has it?

28:28.254 --> 28:30.998
By giving a second man
a dose of Pendrimine.

28:31.055 --> 28:32.695
Sir Wilfrid Laurier.

28:33.600 --> 28:34.989
Laurier?

28:35.109 --> 28:38.103
All he has to do is stay
out of sight for a few days.

28:38.223 --> 28:39.726
Can you contact him?

28:39.846 --> 28:41.849
Or have Agent Tanner do it?

28:42.572 --> 28:45.619
Well, I suppose but how do
we find someone who looks

28:45.652 --> 28:47.462
exactly like a young Laurier?

28:47.514 --> 28:49.893
Few people have even seen a photograph

28:49.921 --> 28:51.606
of Laurier as a young man.

28:51.851 --> 28:54.128
All we have to do is find someone who

28:54.140 --> 28:55.967
looks like a Prime Minister.

28:56.189 --> 28:58.699
The newspapers will
run wild with the story

28:58.705 --> 29:00.709
and soon the whole world will know!

29:00.977 --> 29:02.218
Murdoch.

29:02.719 --> 29:05.239
Your Laurier gambit may have worked.

29:05.359 --> 29:07.575
We've had contact from
six foreign diplomats,

29:07.592 --> 29:10.239
all desperate to obtain
the drug for their country.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.455
Let's hope one of them is
the man we're looking for.

29:13.485 --> 29:16.804
Hm.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.073
Hm...

29:29.117 --> 29:30.469
Sir.

29:30.860 --> 29:33.728
There's no evidence that any
of these men are P.D. Lion.

29:33.771 --> 29:35.588
And what of Pendrick's formula?

29:35.622 --> 29:37.857
Their rooms are being searched now.

29:38.025 --> 29:40.702
Sir! It's the Inspector.

29:41.334 --> 29:43.286
He's been attacked.

29:47.835 --> 29:49.350
Sir.

29:49.691 --> 29:51.986
He's still alive, but unconscious.

29:52.106 --> 29:53.772
It seems he was able to
fight off his attacker,

29:53.795 --> 29:56.243
and perhaps the entire dose of
the poison wasn't administered.

29:56.271 --> 29:57.666
Any symptoms?

29:57.734 --> 30:00.188
The same reportedly
suffered by Mr. Pendrick.

30:00.376 --> 30:02.595
He had a bottle of the
additive. Where is it now?

30:02.607 --> 30:04.207
Stolen, it would seem, sir.

30:04.646 --> 30:05.790
Hm...

30:06.109 --> 30:09.389
- When did the attack occur?
- An hour ago, maybe less.

30:09.423 --> 30:12.091
All the diplomats were at
Station House Number Four.

30:12.281 --> 30:14.360
If one of them did kill Mr. Pendrick,

30:14.395 --> 30:16.614
I suppose he could have sent
someone after the additive.

30:16.637 --> 30:19.005
Indeed. It would be an
excellent opportunity,

30:19.056 --> 30:21.601
to strike while establishing
an iron-clad alibi.

30:25.307 --> 30:26.773
Sir.

30:29.213 --> 30:31.110
One of Meyers' bracelets?

30:36.107 --> 30:39.085
- Murdoch. What's going on?
- Sir.

30:39.119 --> 30:40.639
The empty vial.

30:40.759 --> 30:43.554
Terrence Meyers, you are under
arrest for the attempted murder

30:43.565 --> 30:46.269
of Thomas Brackenreid and for
the murder of James Pendrick.

30:53.619 --> 30:57.006
Oh, this is preposterous.
Clearly I was set up.

30:57.063 --> 30:59.483
You had the empty vial
of additive in your hand.

30:59.500 --> 31:02.306
Which I found in my room
shortly before you arrived.

31:02.700 --> 31:05.700
We also found one of your
bracelets at the scene.

31:07.442 --> 31:09.139
I have all my tumpas.

31:09.810 --> 31:11.313
Six on the right.

31:11.342 --> 31:14.091
- Five on the left.
- Yes, precisely!

31:15.588 --> 31:17.872
There isn't one missing, Murdoch.

31:17.923 --> 31:19.488
I am Ranying.

31:19.608 --> 31:23.115
My people festooned me with one
ring for every head which I...

31:24.071 --> 31:26.545
It doesn't matter. The point
is whatever it is you found

31:26.577 --> 31:27.898
did not belong to me.

31:28.091 --> 31:29.515
Who put it there then?

31:29.554 --> 31:32.247
I assume any one of those
so-called "diplomats."

31:32.565 --> 31:34.934
The Turks have especially
had it in for me.

31:34.985 --> 31:36.818
- The Turks.
- The culprit is likely

31:36.846 --> 31:39.055
spiriting the Pendrimine
away to his homeland

31:39.072 --> 31:41.497
while you're sitting here
wasting your time with me.

31:43.290 --> 31:45.920
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Brackenreid.

31:46.153 --> 31:48.817
They say he should
regain consciousness soon.

31:49.530 --> 31:51.191
Did you catch him?

31:51.487 --> 31:53.115
Whoever did this?

31:53.734 --> 31:55.261
We did.

32:03.831 --> 32:05.561
Mrs. Brackenreid!

32:06.614 --> 32:08.129
Stay with him.

32:08.180 --> 32:10.936
I'll return as soon
as I'm able, I have...

32:11.368 --> 32:14.362
Oh, did his eyes just open?

32:17.693 --> 32:19.720
I have to tell her! This
has gone on long enough.

32:19.742 --> 32:22.515
Sir, we need to maintain
the ruse just a bit longer.

32:22.563 --> 32:25.829
- She was kissing another man!
- One she believes to be you.

32:25.949 --> 32:28.390
- What's your point?
- Well sir, it can hardly be characterized

32:28.413 --> 32:31.339
- as an infidelity if she believes...
- Oh, bloody hell, Murdoch!

32:31.345 --> 32:33.741
I don't care what you
characterize it as!

32:34.075 --> 32:36.451
Do you know what it's like seeing
your wife kissing another man?

32:36.497 --> 32:39.189
Actually sir, James
Pendrick kissed Julia

32:39.203 --> 32:42.057
in the days leading up to
your departure for Panama...

32:42.690 --> 32:45.607
- Right. Well then, you know what I'm saying.
- I do,

32:45.727 --> 32:48.658
but I was able to subsume those feelings

32:48.726 --> 32:52.137
knowing that Julia herself
clearly had nothing to do

32:52.154 --> 32:55.280
in the matter and obviously has no...

32:55.576 --> 32:58.809
feelings for James
Pendrick or any other man.

32:58.929 --> 33:01.246
- You've thought this through.
- I have.

33:01.263 --> 33:04.816
- Have you talked with her about it?
- Well, that would imply that it bothers me.

33:05.180 --> 33:06.956
Which it doesn't.

33:07.308 --> 33:09.934
Right. But...

33:12.200 --> 33:14.392
Why are we wasting time,
anyway? We've arrested Meyers.

33:14.415 --> 33:16.943
Sir, something just doesn't seem right.

33:17.063 --> 33:20.200
Why would Terrance Meyers
tell us that he was in Toronto

33:20.217 --> 33:22.655
if he intended to steal
the additive all along?

33:22.690 --> 33:26.073
The man's out of his mind! He
got a taste for power in Borneo

33:26.080 --> 33:28.254
and now he won't stop
until he achieves more.

33:28.311 --> 33:31.398
All the same, sir, if we could
wait another twenty-four hours.

33:31.437 --> 33:34.113
Just to be sure we have the right man.

33:34.142 --> 33:35.531
Fine.

33:35.651 --> 33:38.144
Another day rotting
away in Pendrick's study.

33:45.538 --> 33:47.046
Hello, Constable!

33:47.496 --> 33:49.482
Any good crimes lately?

33:50.041 --> 33:51.995
I'm writing a report on a lady

33:52.001 --> 33:54.728
who says her neighbour's
horse walks too loudly.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.775
"Nina, you'll be in my
heart until the day I die.

34:19.792 --> 34:22.114
Or, if I turn into a mummy, much longer.

34:22.125 --> 34:23.239
Love, George."

34:23.268 --> 34:24.607
Louise!

34:26.463 --> 34:28.541
- Louise, let me just say...
- I'm sorry, George.

34:28.552 --> 34:30.665
I had no intention of
going through your things.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.857
I understand why you wouldn't
want to give away this copy.

34:32.875 --> 34:34.132
Louise, please...

34:35.246 --> 34:37.175
Look, I didn't intend for any of this.

34:37.244 --> 34:38.842
The man I own the garage with

34:39.056 --> 34:40.783
happens to be Nina's brother.

34:40.813 --> 34:43.420
I was there, he gave me
some things that she'd left.

34:43.638 --> 34:45.873
I guess she didn't want this anymore.

34:46.553 --> 34:49.782
- Why would you keep that from me?
- I don't know, I... I...

34:50.009 --> 34:51.822
For a moment, I suppose I felt guilty.

34:51.835 --> 34:53.790
The past came rushing back and I...

34:53.804 --> 34:55.953
And you thought you'd made a mistake.

35:06.906 --> 35:09.321
It would mean the world to me
if you'd read my book, Louise.

35:12.869 --> 35:14.035
Then I will.

35:18.417 --> 35:21.572
You have accused Mr. Meyers
of murder in the past.

35:21.586 --> 35:23.267
This is different.

35:23.436 --> 35:26.527
Meyers has been in the
far east for too long.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.680
What is his story?
Does it seem rational?

35:30.327 --> 35:32.891
He claims that he's been set up.

35:33.011 --> 35:36.326
That a foreign agent
has stolen the additive.

35:36.590 --> 35:39.879
But... why bother setting up Meyers?

35:39.920 --> 35:41.792
Why not simply steal the additive

35:41.846 --> 35:43.909
and then vanish into thin air?

35:44.465 --> 35:47.133
Well, if you're unswayed
by the alternatives,

35:47.184 --> 35:49.816
you have to assume you have
your killer behind bars.

35:50.222 --> 35:51.534
I suppose.

35:52.130 --> 35:53.514
And what about the Inspector?

35:53.551 --> 35:55.063
Has he told Margaret yet?

35:55.400 --> 35:56.544
Not yet.

35:57.646 --> 36:01.877
Julia, the last time
we saw James Pendrick...

36:02.442 --> 36:04.756
Does any of that bother you?

36:06.555 --> 36:08.195
- The kiss?
- Hm.

36:08.315 --> 36:10.924
No!

36:11.170 --> 36:13.487
I haven't thought about it for a moment.

36:13.742 --> 36:15.809
- Does it bother you?
- Of course not.

36:16.037 --> 36:17.576
He was out of his mind.

36:18.432 --> 36:20.009
And now he's dead.

36:21.671 --> 36:23.128
Indeed.

36:34.074 --> 36:35.550
Oh my God.

36:45.315 --> 36:46.654
It's time, Mr. Meyers.

36:46.868 --> 36:48.444
We have to hand you over.

36:49.706 --> 36:52.976
How long have we known
each other, Murdoch? Hm?

36:53.534 --> 36:55.177
Ten years, I suppose.

36:56.201 --> 36:58.028
That sounds about right.

36:59.043 --> 37:01.857
Do you honestly consider
me a threat to this country?

37:01.889 --> 37:03.269
To my fellow man?

37:03.816 --> 37:06.139
Come on, you know me.

37:07.692 --> 37:09.855
You know they're gonna
consider this treason.

37:10.620 --> 37:11.699
I'll be hanged.

37:12.779 --> 37:14.004
Let me go.

37:15.785 --> 37:17.939
It's not up to me, Mr. Meyers.

37:17.976 --> 37:20.176
Sure it is. Just open
the door, turn your back.

37:20.296 --> 37:23.842
You'll never see me again, I
swear. I'll return to my people.

37:23.869 --> 37:25.322
You would go back to Borneo?

37:25.354 --> 37:27.553
I will never set foot
in this country again.

37:28.933 --> 37:31.510
So, what difference does it
make if they hang me or...

37:31.738 --> 37:33.601
if I simply vanish forever?

37:39.881 --> 37:41.985
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

37:43.770 --> 37:46.262
Ah! Thank you, Detective.

37:49.428 --> 37:51.651
All ready, are we, Meyers?

37:52.033 --> 37:53.796
The Prime Minister awaits.

37:53.969 --> 37:55.227
And I assure you

37:55.983 --> 37:58.734
he is not in a merciful mood.

38:09.234 --> 38:10.523
Murdoch!

38:11.382 --> 38:13.461
Where's Murdoch? Murdoch!

38:13.515 --> 38:14.647
- Sir?
- Oh!

38:14.767 --> 38:16.353
No, sir, why are you so old again?

38:16.399 --> 38:19.191
Oh my God, sir, what's happened?

38:19.311 --> 38:22.252
- Just yesterday you were a young man!
- Oh, get off, Crabtree.

38:22.283 --> 38:24.196
- Where's Murdoch?
- Sir?

38:24.387 --> 38:25.530
The place has been ransacked.

38:25.567 --> 38:27.598
All Pendrick's equipment's been stolen.

38:27.794 --> 38:29.024
Of course.

38:29.238 --> 38:31.388
Meyers believed Pendrick's
equipment was crucial

38:31.402 --> 38:34.253
- in synthesizing the Pendrimine.
- But I was there.

38:34.373 --> 38:36.584
The place hadn't been robbed yet
when Mr. Prout was attacked...

38:36.616 --> 38:38.807
- when Meyers was arrested.
- Who's Mr. Prout?

38:38.825 --> 38:40.492
- Young me!
- But you're young you.

38:40.501 --> 38:42.846
- Oh, shut up, Higgins.
- Then it couldn't be Meyers.

38:42.855 --> 38:43.812
Then who?

38:43.816 --> 38:46.084
Did you tell anyone the
lie about the laboratory?

38:46.262 --> 38:47.032
No.

38:47.697 --> 38:51.080
But someone else was listening
in on the conversation.

38:51.773 --> 38:53.052
But...

38:54.455 --> 38:55.658
Stop!

38:55.818 --> 38:57.316
Driver, stop!

38:58.382 --> 39:01.270
What's the problem? What's going on?

39:04.348 --> 39:05.373
Wait a minute...

39:05.493 --> 39:08.648
Agent Tanner, you are under arrest
for the murder of James Pendrick

39:08.693 --> 39:11.021
- and the attempted murder...
- Me? I think not.

39:11.053 --> 39:13.358
We know it was you. You're P.D. Lion.

39:13.478 --> 39:16.259
What of it? You can't prove
that I killed Pendrick.

39:16.300 --> 39:18.386
You poisoned a man here, in Toronto.

39:18.468 --> 39:20.305
When he recovers, he'll identify you.

39:20.332 --> 39:23.005
So? If the Inspector survives,

39:23.024 --> 39:24.544
what will you charge me with?

39:24.664 --> 39:27.908
Attempted murder?

39:28.534 --> 39:30.089
It's enough to lock you up.

39:30.209 --> 39:32.817
And stop you from taking the
Pendrimine back to Ottawa.

39:32.845 --> 39:34.974
Ottawa? No, no, no.

39:35.362 --> 39:37.599
In the hands of the masses,

39:37.605 --> 39:41.105
eternal life would cause an
epidemic of overpopulation.

39:41.293 --> 39:43.764
I took it for myself...
well, myself and...

39:43.980 --> 39:46.627
a handful of the wealthiest
buyers in the world, so...

39:46.696 --> 39:48.836
lock me up. Five years, ten, twenty.

39:48.876 --> 39:52.337
Time matters not in the face of...

39:52.992 --> 39:55.269
... eternal life.

39:59.499 --> 40:01.059
Ah!

40:01.913 --> 40:03.547
Second ever dose of Pendrimine,

40:03.558 --> 40:05.665
mixed by my own hand.

40:05.938 --> 40:08.500
Everlasting youth... is mine.

40:08.790 --> 40:10.584
I don't believe we've met.

40:10.868 --> 40:12.980
Inspector Thomas C. Brackenreid.

40:13.048 --> 40:14.637
You've been had.

40:15.178 --> 40:16.846
No...

40:28.192 --> 40:29.337
Margaret.

40:29.980 --> 40:31.284
It's me.

40:31.945 --> 40:34.131
But... but...

40:34.392 --> 40:36.315
he's you.

40:36.349 --> 40:39.505
I'm sorry but no. I'm me, warts and all.

40:39.693 --> 40:42.312
So it was all a lie?

40:43.314 --> 40:46.303
I didn't want to hide it
from you. But I had to.

40:46.348 --> 40:48.511
It was the only way to
catch Pendrick's killer.

40:48.568 --> 40:49.871
It had to seem real.

40:49.928 --> 40:51.625
People had to see that you believed it.

40:53.560 --> 40:56.162
Uh, people believed it,
because I played the part.

40:56.282 --> 40:59.242
I didn't believe for one second
that this young man was you.

40:59.248 --> 41:01.377
- You didn't?
- Of course not!

41:01.388 --> 41:03.552
He was far too considerate, for one.

41:03.700 --> 41:05.987
I assumed you were up
to some kind of nonsense

41:06.107 --> 41:07.860
and I went along with it.

41:07.980 --> 41:10.610
You had your fun, and I had mine.

41:11.082 --> 41:13.558
Bloody hell! Margaret,
who is this imposter?

41:13.587 --> 41:15.022
Oh, It's all right,
Quentin, I think the horse

41:15.062 --> 41:16.997
has left the barn on that one.

41:18.079 --> 41:19.892
I'll tell you this, Margaret.

41:20.173 --> 41:21.927
It was no fun for one single second

41:21.933 --> 41:24.865
- being locked away in that laboratory.
- Oh, uncomfortable, was it?

41:25.189 --> 41:27.291
Or did you run out of scotch?

41:28.603 --> 41:30.429
The problem wasn't where I was.

41:30.630 --> 41:32.024
It was where I wasn't.

41:32.839 --> 41:34.451
Kept away from my family.

41:35.303 --> 41:36.587
Kept away from you.

41:37.799 --> 41:39.557
Oh Thomas.

41:46.257 --> 41:49.012
Full reinstatement from
Prime Minister Laurier.

41:49.039 --> 41:52.710
Oh, and he sends his thanks
for exposing Agent Tanner.

41:52.778 --> 41:55.378
I wasn't sure you'd welcome
a return to your old position,

41:55.383 --> 41:57.110
Mr. Meyers.

41:58.326 --> 42:01.450
Well, they do say the
trappings make the man.

42:02.170 --> 42:04.187
Once I was back in my old habiliments,

42:04.206 --> 42:05.818
I found I wanted nothing more

42:05.850 --> 42:07.193
than to be in the civilized company

42:07.216 --> 42:08.774
of the Canadian federal government.

42:10.310 --> 42:12.030
What about the Pendrimine?

42:12.076 --> 42:15.236
I mean, I know it didn't work,
but according to the Inspector,

42:15.259 --> 42:16.898
Mr. Pendrick was really
getting somewhere with it.

42:17.139 --> 42:18.875
Yes. We found the stolen formula.

42:18.903 --> 42:22.114
But any further work on his research
would be fruitless, I'm afraid.

42:22.234 --> 42:23.995
Perhaps the Detective
could do something with it.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.318
I know your additive was a
fake, sir, but that's not to say

42:26.327 --> 42:27.848
you couldn't make it work if you tried.

42:27.912 --> 42:29.561
I don't know that I could but I suppose

42:29.570 --> 42:31.392
do anything, it wouldn't hurt to try.

42:31.533 --> 42:34.352
It's not the research itself
that would be fruitless.

42:34.584 --> 42:36.566
It's the Panamanian guarana.

42:36.789 --> 42:37.760
The...

42:37.787 --> 42:40.829
Oh! Uh, Pendrick's active ingredient.

42:40.843 --> 42:41.931
Hm.

42:42.446 --> 42:44.686
The Americans are building
a canal down there.

42:44.700 --> 42:46.736
Our sources tell us
that every last trace

42:46.745 --> 42:49.847
of Panamanian guarana
has been destroyed.

42:50.726 --> 42:53.540
The Americans have ruined
any chance the world had

42:53.576 --> 42:54.937
at eternal life.

42:55.333 --> 42:56.675
Ah well, there's nothing to say

42:56.686 --> 42:58.144
that it would have amounted to anything.

42:58.180 --> 43:00.753
Maybe there is. Look at this postcard.

43:00.941 --> 43:03.037
Dropped at the front desk. Unsigned.

43:03.060 --> 43:06.521
"Thanks for saving my life."
Sir, whose life did you save?

43:06.530 --> 43:07.819
You tell me.

43:08.456 --> 43:09.527
Is that... ?

43:11.963 --> 43:13.589
Could it really be him?

43:16.194 --> 43:17.875
James bloody Pendrick.

43:18.052 --> 43:19.842
He's still alive.

43:20.406 --> 43:22.055
On an all new Murdoch.

43:22.078 --> 43:23.939
It appears to have originated here.

43:23.985 --> 43:26.321
- Perhaps she triggered it?
- It's a man's world

43:26.328 --> 43:28.894
- where women seek refuge.
- No men allowed!

43:28.905 --> 43:30.670
With explosive consequences.

43:30.693 --> 43:32.561
- We need a man on the inside.
- You mean a woman.

43:32.578 --> 43:35.647

Monday at 8:00 on CBC.
