Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express.

00:06.920 --> 00:10.919
Come and watch pikeys making a mess
of the lives they were given

00:12.040 --> 00:14.399
by 'im upstairs...

00:14.400 --> 00:17.879
and kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:17.880 --> 00:18.919
Stay away!

00:18.920 --> 00:22.719
Stay away!
What sounds on earth
could ever replace

00:22.720 --> 00:25.599
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:25.600 --> 00:28.239
Because this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:28.240 --> 00:32.238
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented -

00:33.160 --> 00:36.879
to calm us all down,
to stop us going mental.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.879
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.360 --> 00:45.079
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.879
You shit on our head.

00:47.880 --> 00:51.879
But you pay the taxes!

00:53.360 --> 00:56.799
Imagine a Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers,

00:56.800 --> 00:59.239
who'd cum on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.679
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:02.680 --> 01:06.679
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:08.960 --> 01:12.959
Scatter. Party!

(LIAM) 'Some old fella
was found dead in his bed.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.519
'Nothing unusual in that.

01:25.520 --> 01:29.519
'Apart from the fact he'd snuffed it
at least six months previous.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.479
'Nothing unusual in that,
apart from the fact

01:33.480 --> 01:35.199
'that he lived in a busy street

01:35.200 --> 01:39.199
'that prides itself on Neighbourhood
Watch and community spirit.

01:40.720 --> 01:44.719
'But somewhere amongst all that
bonhomie, a human being had died

01:45.080 --> 01:48.359
'and no-one even noticed,
because they were all too busy,

01:48.360 --> 01:50.159
'too selfish to clock it.'

01:50.160 --> 01:52.199
All right, babes.

01:52.200 --> 01:55.919
'What we need is for someone to
shake us out of this sleep we're in,

01:55.920 --> 01:59.439
'to remind us that we're all cogs
in a big machine

01:59.440 --> 02:02.719
'and if we don't start looking after
each other,then we're doomed.

02:02.720 --> 02:06.719

to show us the way, set an example.

'But where are you going to find
one of them around here, eh?'

02:16.520 --> 02:20.519
Hey...the one thing I do not need
when I'm in this much of a hurry,

02:20.720 --> 02:22.239
is one of your floozies
taking space in the bathroom.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.959
is one of your floozies
taking space in the bathroom.
Yeah, happy 50th birthday,
you miserable bastard.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.959
And I didn't pull a floozy last
night. I'm very happy with Maxine.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.159
15 minutes she was in there,
with her ablutions.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.719
I'm outside, bladder's busting.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.159
Had to take a piss
in the sink in the end.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.959
Why bring her back here.
What if Maxine finds out?!

02:38.960 --> 02:42.799
Why bring her back here.
What if Maxine finds out?!
Finds out what, Frank?

02:42.800 --> 02:44.359
Oh, my dad was just asking me

02:44.360 --> 02:47.559
how I think you'd react if
you caught me with this lady here.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.959
I'd rip his balls off.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.959
I wouldn't blame you.
Hey, morning, Frank. Remember me?

02:53.800 --> 02:56.079
Yeah, we met
in The Jockey last night.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.119
Yeah, we had a few drinks,
got chatting

02:59.120 --> 03:02.679
and before long,
we found ourselves back here,

03:02.680 --> 03:05.319
one thing led to another
and, er, here she is...

03:05.320 --> 03:09.319
We are.
Isn't that right? Enjoy it?

03:14.560 --> 03:18.559
Happy birthday, mate!

03:19.600 --> 03:23.599
None of this would've happened if I'd
got my alarm call like I asked for.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.199
Where've you been,
you selfish little shit?

03:27.200 --> 03:29.639
Out earning a living,
so don't wag a finger at me,

03:29.640 --> 03:33.639
you job-shy, sponging
waste of space!

03:34.120 --> 03:38.119
Don't talk to me like that. I've
got a job, and all. I contribute!

03:38.840 --> 03:40.079
I've got a job.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.439
I've got a job.
Wouldn't really call it a job.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.319
Oh, well what would you call it,
then, smartarse?

03:44.320 --> 03:47.679
Community service?

03:47.680 --> 03:49.399
# My boy lollipop... #

03:49.400 --> 03:51.119
Come on.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.439
# You make my heart
go giddy-up... #

03:52.440 --> 03:56.439
# You make my heart

HORN TOOTS

04:01.800 --> 04:04.999
Nice to see you paying your debt
to society, Gallagher.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.039
POP!

04:06.040 --> 04:10.039
POP!
(LAUGHS)

04:15.840 --> 04:17.478
Not long now.

04:17.480 --> 04:19.199
Half of me can't wait.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.879
The other half
doesn't want it to happen at all.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.799
They say you forget the pain,
though.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.279
How could you forget the sensation

04:26.280 --> 04:30.279
of having an eight-pound bundle
of flesh and bone trying
to fight it's way out you

04:31.360 --> 04:34.919
Seven I've had. There's more scar
tissue down there than fanny now.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.559
I remember Paddy telling me
he'd finished.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.119
I didn't even know he'd started.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.519
Like chucking a chipolata
up the Mersey tunnel.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.959
All sense of grip gone.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.439
Worth it, though.

04:45.440 --> 04:49.319
When you've got that little bundle
in your arms, it's all worth it.

04:49.320 --> 04:53.319
I just want it out now.
I mean, two weeks overdue.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.879
I was three weeks over
carrying our Jamie.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.279
A few tricks you might want to try.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.839
Me and Paddy were at it 24/7
to try and budge him.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.599
Tried that.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.399
I love you.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.399
God, I love you.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.399
Curry?

05:13.400 --> 05:14.799
Heartburn.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.159
Get a few gins down your neck.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.599
Might that damage the baby?

05:18.600 --> 05:21.279
Nah, I did it with all of mine.
They turned out OK.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.639
Where do you want these, Mam?

05:27.840 --> 05:31.839
TINNY MUSIC

05:32.080 --> 05:33.759
All this is for Liam, is it?

05:33.760 --> 05:35.839
His birthday party tonight as well.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.239
Oh...

05:37.240 --> 05:40.199
I feel sorry for Liam having
to share a birthday with you.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.879
He'd have been better off born with
the number of the beast on his head.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.639
He'd have been better off born with
the number of the beast on his head.
Oh, well...

05:45.640 --> 05:47.039
Nin!

05:47.040 --> 05:48.399
All right, Nin!

05:48.400 --> 05:52.319
How's my second favourite
great-grandson?

05:52.320 --> 05:55.999
Yeah, I'm cool. This is
my girlfriend, Max. This is Nin.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.439
Hiya. Fancy a brew?

05:57.440 --> 06:01.439
Oh, that would be lovely.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.319
Happy birthday, Liam.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.559
Happy birthday, Liam.
Nin!

06:05.560 --> 06:07.319
And happy birthday, Vernon.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.919
Oh, cheers, Nin.

06:08.920 --> 06:12.799
I would've been round sooner
but Jonty went hypoglycemic

06:12.800 --> 06:16.799
so I've spent half the morning
force-feeding him Mars Bars.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.799
Sister.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.959
Thank Christ for that.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.519
Well, I've come round
to offer my services.

06:30.520 --> 06:34.519
I heard Monica had
popped out for a loaf again.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.679
Oh, I wonder
where you heard that from(!)

06:36.680 --> 06:40.679
Thanks, love. Well, I love cooking,
cleaning, ironing's a doddle,

06:41.120 --> 06:45.119
babies need a mother,
so do young boys.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.039
And with Debbie in the Army now...

06:47.040 --> 06:49.399
I don't think
that's going to work, Nin.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.799
It can't be easy,
with Monica leaving.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.239
Well, we've all adapted.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.479
Well, we've all adapted.
Nin could come
a couple of nights a week, maybe.

06:56.480 --> 07:00.119
You could stay over.
Liam'd bunk in Stella's room.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.319
Yes, you could go out
for a pint, I could babysit.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.439
No. No, it's too much.
Much too much.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.919
No way.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.639
..hell.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.119
All right.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.919
It was just a thought.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.079
I've got to get off now. >

07:16.080 --> 07:17.799
Jonty'll be needing a feed.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.919
Yeah... Eh, don't be a stranger.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.559
I'll pop round when I can.
Bye, darling.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.759
I'll pop round when I can.
Bye, darling.
Nice to meet ya.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.799
You're welcome to come round
whenever you want.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.239
You're welcome to come round
whenever you want.
Yeah, whenever.

07:28.240 --> 07:32.239
OK, bye-bye.

07:33.640 --> 07:34.399
You piece of shit.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.399
You piece of shit.
That was horrible. She's lonely.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.599
I'm lonely.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.879
I'm lonely.
You're a sociopath, she's an OAP.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.999
It's not always about you,
you know. >

07:42.000 --> 07:42.759
It's not...

07:42.760 --> 07:43.879
It's not...
What about us and Liam? >

07:43.880 --> 07:44.919
It's not...
What about us and Liam? >
Oh.

07:44.920 --> 07:47.319
Nin wanted to help -
we could have done with it!

07:47.320 --> 07:50.839
You better have remembered
Liam's present. You promised him!

07:50.840 --> 07:52.319
Yeah, course I remembered!

07:52.320 --> 07:55.439
Not every day your youngest lad
reaches his teens, is it?

07:55.440 --> 07:59.439
He's 11.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.399
Get off me fuckin' case!

08:01.400 --> 08:03.639
Get out!

08:03.640 --> 08:07.639
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

08:07.760 --> 08:11.759

your contacts in the underworld

08:40.039 --> 08:41.479
Go on, kids.
Liam told me about Nin.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.039
Wait there.Nice one(!)

08:43.039 --> 08:44.519
Just what I need another -
Esther fuckin' Rantzen!

08:44.520 --> 08:47.719
Just what I need another -
Esther fuckin' Rantzen!
All that shit you fed us about
how Nin was the one that saved you

08:47.720 --> 08:49.479
when you were little
and yourmum died

08:49.480 --> 08:53.479
and how you were living
with your bastard of a father,
that was all bollocks?

08:53.800 --> 08:56.679
So she moves in and it's all
cottage pies and starched shirts.

08:56.680 --> 09:00.679
But you know yourself, within weeks
it'll be sponging her women's bits
and wiping her arse!

09:01.280 --> 09:05.279
I'm a single parent now,
got two kids under...

09:06.080 --> 09:07.719
12.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.599
At the age of 50,
I'd like a little bit of colour
in my otherwise monochrome life!

09:11.600 --> 09:15.599
Selfish! Left the upbringing of his
kids to anyone that'd take 'em on,

09:15.920 --> 09:17.319
and I should know -
I'm one of them!

09:17.320 --> 09:19.759
and I should know -
I'm one of them!
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I made mistakes!

09:19.760 --> 09:21.519
Oh, I'm fallible!

09:21.520 --> 09:24.079
Let he who is without sin
cast the first st...

09:24.080 --> 09:26.119
Oh!

09:26.120 --> 09:29.799
Not funny son, not fuckin'...

09:29.800 --> 09:33.799
OK, OK, OK. Contrition you want,
and contrition you shall have!

09:47.080 --> 09:49.439
N-o-o-o!

HORN BLARES

09:51.640 --> 09:53.799
Oh!

09:53.800 --> 09:55.319
(MAN) Dozy bastard!

09:55.320 --> 09:59.159
I shouldn't wear these things.
You saved my life.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.759
Just doing my duty, Mrs...?

10:00.760 --> 10:04.759
Miss. Miss Croker.Libby Croker.

10:06.800 --> 10:10.799
Thank you.

10:12.240 --> 10:16.239
Hey...

10:28.000 --> 10:28.999
What you after, Lillian?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.559
Can't I wish a friend and neighbour
all the best on his big one?

10:31.560 --> 10:33.879
Well, you could if I was
your friend and neighbour.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.879
And you're getting
nowhere near my big one.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.919
Your survival's been
a combination of advance medical

10:38.920 --> 10:41.239
science and sheer bloody-mindedness.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.719
You can go when you've finished.

10:43.720 --> 10:47.399
Half a century, eh? Wish I'd had
a bet on that. Imagine the odds!

10:47.400 --> 10:48.399
Of what?

10:48.400 --> 10:49.759
You still being here.

10:49.760 --> 10:53.119
And when it is your turn
to meet your maker,

10:53.120 --> 10:57.119
it'll be sudden.
Like the flicking of a switch.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.679

10:59.680 --> 11:03.679

11:08.640 --> 11:12.639
What the fuck?

11:38.120 --> 11:41.399
Happy birthday, Dad.

11:41.400 --> 11:45.399
I'm sorry.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.439
Well, if you're wondering
why they all left,

11:49.440 --> 11:52.399
I'll enlighten you.
You're not worth hanging around for.

11:52.400 --> 11:56.399
I had something good, something
special with each of these women.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.279
They haven't had something good
with you though, have they?

12:00.280 --> 12:03.039
Cos the minute they woke up to
what you were, they were gone.

12:03.040 --> 12:07.039
And I don't blame them. Cos
the minute I can get out, I will.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.399
Well, why wait?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.439
'Libby Crocker.

12:22.440 --> 12:26.439
'Miss Crocker.'

12:36.560 --> 12:39.519
Could this get any better?

12:39.520 --> 12:43.519
I think it could.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.239
There's no need to apologise
for your father.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.439
He always was a selfish little shit.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.079
Just like his mother.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.079
Was she as bad?

12:57.080 --> 13:00.399
Yeah, but at least she was sober.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.279
Well, some of the time.

13:02.280 --> 13:06.279
Now, you've had your birthday treat,
I want you and me to have a talk.

13:08.280 --> 13:12.279
If it's the birds and bees thing,
it's about six weeks too late.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.639
You're full of promise, Liam.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.759
I want you to fulfil your potential.

13:17.760 --> 13:18.759
Go for it.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.359
Give me a hand.

13:20.360 --> 13:23.639
Someday you're going to be faced with
a situation where

13:23.640 --> 13:27.239
to get what you want you have to
tread on someone's head.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.679
And when that situation arises...

13:29.680 --> 13:31.959
I know, do the right thing.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.279
No, none of that
touchy-feely bollocks.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.159
Go for the jugular. The kill.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.679
What kind of advice is that?

13:38.680 --> 13:41.399
Good advice. Carry no passengers.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.959
Bit rich, coming from you.

13:42.960 --> 13:46.519
Jonty? I hate
the fucking sight of him.

13:46.520 --> 13:50.519
If I'd known he was going to cabbage
within six months of our marriage,

13:51.360 --> 13:54.559
I'd have steered well clear.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.879
Look at him, useless.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.879
An endless drain on my time,
energy and resources.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.599
Oh, you don't mean that.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.919
I do.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.199
He'd be better off dead.

14:10.200 --> 14:14.199
Me and him both.

14:16.400 --> 14:20.399
Here. You finish up and get off home.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.679
SQUELCHING

14:22.680 --> 14:24.719
Oh, God.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.599
His bag's burst again.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.599
I'll get the bucket,
you open the windows.

14:31.680 --> 14:35.039
DANCE MUSIC THUMPS

14:35.040 --> 14:37.799
Weirdest place you've ever done it.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.359
Llandudno.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.999
(BOTH) Bog on a train.

14:42.000 --> 14:42.559
Together?

14:42.560 --> 14:44.239
(BOTH) No!

14:44.240 --> 14:46.199
Back of a police bike.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.039
It were parked up. Spain.

14:48.040 --> 14:48.719
What, was it a copper?

14:48.720 --> 14:49.759
Yeah.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.999
Uniform, boots, tache?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.639
Uh-huh.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.319
Lillian, weirdest place
you've ever done it.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.319
Up the bum.
Brendan was a bugger for it.

14:57.320 --> 15:01.319
(ALL GIGGLE)

15:09.160 --> 15:10.599
Jamie!

15:10.600 --> 15:14.199
He's at Frank's party
with his ma and pa.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.039
Get out.

15:16.040 --> 15:20.039
The day of judgement looms, eh?

15:20.440 --> 15:23.439
Pritchard Junior's gonna pop
out and then you've got

15:23.440 --> 15:25.599
some explaining to do, haven't you?

15:25.600 --> 15:27.239
Well, I'll tell him if you want.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.799
Get out.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.999
Sorry, Jamie.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.959
Thing is, me and your missus,
we just couldn't help ourselves.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.959
Some sort of attraction
going on and try as we might...

15:41.840 --> 15:43.599
..we just can't fight it.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.679
I love Jamie.

15:44.680 --> 15:48.679
But you want me.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.279
He's reliable,

15:58.280 --> 16:02.279
solid, trustworthy, loyal, gentle.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.959
He'll make a lovely dad.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.159
And he bores
the fuckin' arse off ya.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.679
Get out... AHH!

16:10.680 --> 16:13.119
Shit!

16:13.120 --> 16:17.119
Get an ambulance!

16:17.160 --> 16:19.959
Oh, brilliant(!)

16:19.960 --> 16:23.559
Jamie's gonna love this one!

16:23.560 --> 16:25.439
Big daddy's gonna miss it!

16:25.440 --> 16:26.599
Please!

16:26.600 --> 16:30.599
All these months of antenatal
and birth partner classes

16:30.880 --> 16:34.319
and he's necking it
round the Gallaghers' when
the big moment comes.

16:34.320 --> 16:38.319
Priceless, Karen!

16:38.840 --> 16:42.839
(GROANS)

16:46.200 --> 16:48.039
Right, come here.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.719
Fuck off!

16:50.720 --> 16:52.479
I don't want you

16:52.480 --> 16:56.479
anywhere near us!

16:58.040 --> 17:01.159
Your call.

17:01.160 --> 17:05.159
Joe!

17:06.520 --> 17:08.199
I need you to hold me.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.719
Being a dad was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.759
He used to say
marrying me was the best thing
that ever happened to him.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.479
Yeah, he'd be lying.

17:16.480 --> 17:20.479
Just wait till the time comes, son.
This surge, this wall of emotion

17:21.680 --> 17:24.319
like you've never experienced
before in your life.

17:24.319 --> 17:27.279
It'll happen the second
you clap eyes on them.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.559
It was three months before
I had the courage

17:29.560 --> 17:31.119
to even squint at my Rodney.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.879
The midwife gasped when he came out.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.719
I'll just give Karen
a call, see if she's OK.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.599
Hey, make the most of it,
son, while you can.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.679
It'll be your last party
you go to for a few years.

17:39.680 --> 17:43.679
Karen'd call if she needed ya.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.439
Right, drop 'em!

18:00.440 --> 18:03.519
Where the fuck is the ambulance!?

18:03.520 --> 18:06.399
Come on, come on, come on,
come on try and stay calm.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.479
What... What did they tell
you to do in your classes?

18:09.480 --> 18:10.959
I'll go see where they are.

18:10.960 --> 18:14.959
Don't leave me!

18:16.080 --> 18:18.879
It's coming!

18:18.880 --> 18:22.239
I'm scared, Joe.

18:22.240 --> 18:26.239
I'm scared. I'm scared!

18:29.880 --> 18:33.719
This is your last chance.
This is your last chance.

18:33.720 --> 18:37.719
You say the word and we disappear.
You, me, and baby.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.599
We get away from this place,
get away from them.

18:40.600 --> 18:44.599
You deserve better than this,
Karen, and you know it!

18:51.240 --> 18:53.439
Jamie!

18:53.440 --> 18:57.439
(GROANS)

19:04.840 --> 19:08.839
What the fuck?

19:17.320 --> 19:21.319
Meet your son.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.999
Joe.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.999
Thank you.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.039
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.

19:47.040 --> 19:51.039
BABY GURGLES

20:04.120 --> 20:05.439
Where's Stella?

20:05.440 --> 20:08.679
I'm not her father.
I'm the 11-year-old kid, remember?

20:08.680 --> 20:09.839
Well, when did you last have her?

20:09.840 --> 20:13.839
Kelly's got her.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.399
Eh?

20:16.400 --> 20:19.479
Happy belated birthday.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.599
There's mud on the wheels.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.239
Yeah, I had to ride it.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.479
Delivery van broke down.

20:25.480 --> 20:28.919
All right, it's knock-off. But if
you scratch off the serial number

20:28.920 --> 20:31.839
and give it a re-spray,
be as good as new.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.399
How can I afford a new one?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.999
Do what every other parent
around here does.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.479
Catalogue, borrow,
could even try getting a job.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.159
I've got a...

20:39.160 --> 20:39.559
It's community...

20:39.560 --> 20:41.319
..fuckin' service, yeah.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.639
Do you want this or what?

20:42.640 --> 20:43.359
Yeah.

20:43.360 --> 20:47.359
Yeah, well, "Thank you, Dad."

20:47.840 --> 20:49.319
What's in for breakfast?

20:49.320 --> 20:53.319
I've had mine.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.879
Byron.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.879
Mad, bad and dangerous to know.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.719
Good to see you again. You all right?

21:20.720 --> 21:24.719
There aren't enough men
like you in the world.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.119
Your wife's a very lucky lady.

21:27.120 --> 21:31.119
She's dead.
Dead... Dead... Dead impressed.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.959
Well, she was, when we were together.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.159
Torn asunder.

21:35.160 --> 21:39.159
Buggered off, yeah.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.599
Not seen you in here before.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.839
Well, I'm just, um...
Helping me son with his revision.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.919
Getting a few research books,
you know.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.559
I'd tell your son to make
the most of this place.

21:55.560 --> 21:58.159
Might not be here much longer if
local government get their way.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.279
Oh.

22:00.280 --> 22:04.279
Well, get most stuff
online now though, eh?

22:04.840 --> 22:08.559
That's no substitute for books.

22:08.560 --> 22:12.559
Opening, inviting you to turn,
explore, experience. Virginal.

22:15.280 --> 22:18.239
Never forget a good one, do you?

22:18.240 --> 22:21.359
The majority of the internet's
used for porn, did you know that?

22:21.360 --> 22:25.039
People would rather watch other
people making love than make love
themselves,

22:25.040 --> 22:28.199
experience all that
life has to offer via a third party.

22:28.200 --> 22:31.959
Anything to stop them engaging.

22:31.960 --> 22:35.959
You're not one of them, are you?

22:36.280 --> 22:40.279
Frank.

22:40.480 --> 22:44.159
Are you a doer
or a watcher, Francis?

22:44.160 --> 22:47.559
A doer, definitely. Always doing, me.

22:47.560 --> 22:51.559
Do you like to
feel the paper, Frank?

22:52.360 --> 22:56.359
Are you a page turner
or a mouse scroller?

22:57.120 --> 22:59.759
Well, let me show you.
What you doing tonight?

22:59.760 --> 23:01.959
Tonight's an empty page.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.439
I've got a cracking quill.
Plenty of ink.

23:04.440 --> 23:08.439
This lady doesn't surrender
her favours so easily.

23:09.600 --> 23:13.519
The thrill of the chase, eh?

23:13.520 --> 23:16.039
You try to pass yourself off
as a man of integrity but,

23:16.040 --> 23:17.959
for all I know,
you might be a charlatan.

23:17.960 --> 23:21.479
Oh, heaven forfend.

23:21.480 --> 23:25.479
So, prove yourself.

23:29.200 --> 23:33.199
Frank.

23:37.200 --> 23:41.199
(Down! Down! Down!)

23:41.320 --> 23:43.159
Thank you all so much.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.399
It's great, cheers.

23:45.400 --> 23:49.399
Where did you get it from?

23:51.280 --> 23:53.759
Here and there.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.639
We're wetting the baby's head
tonight if you're up for it?

23:56.640 --> 23:57.879
We'll see how we go, eh?

23:57.880 --> 23:59.959
I'll be there.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.359
Maybe you should get some rest.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.959
And maybe you should stop
telling me what I can and can't do.

24:03.960 --> 24:07.959
If I can't celebrate him
coming into the world, who can?

24:09.400 --> 24:11.719
I just came to drop a present off.

24:11.720 --> 24:15.719
Cheers.

24:16.520 --> 24:20.519
There's a party later to celebrate
the arrival of the little fella.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.679
You'll be there.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.999
I don't know, Paddy, uh...

24:25.000 --> 24:28.959
I do. You brought my grandson
into the world safe and sound.

24:28.960 --> 24:32.959
Who knows what might've
happened if you hadn't been there?

24:34.400 --> 24:35.119
Sure.

24:35.120 --> 24:39.119
Cheers, mate. I'll be there.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.919
OK, everybody.
And before our star turn,

24:43.920 --> 24:47.919
we can announce the winner
of the guess the weight competition.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.199
It's Micky Maguire.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.319
Yesss! in your face!

24:54.320 --> 24:57.679
Seven pound, four ounces.

24:57.680 --> 24:58.839
Well done.

24:58.840 --> 25:02.279
There's your 50 quid.

25:02.280 --> 25:06.279
APPLAUSE

25:57.240 --> 26:00.039
That's exactly
the reaction I was after.

26:00.040 --> 26:00.759
Don't know what you mean.

26:00.760 --> 26:04.119
You were out after me
in less than a minute.

26:04.120 --> 26:08.119
Don't flatter yourself.

26:11.680 --> 26:14.959
Karen?

26:14.960 --> 26:18.959
Come on, just about to do the toast.

26:24.320 --> 26:25.919
To our son.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.399
Connor Joseph Maguire.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.679
Connor Joseph Maguire!

26:30.680 --> 26:33.359
Connor...Joseph Maguire.

26:33.360 --> 26:37.359
# SHANE MACGOWAN & THE POPES:
Donegal Express

26:48.900 --> 26:49.419
Nin rang.

26:49.420 --> 26:50.459
Nin rang.
Hey, what the fuck?!

26:50.460 --> 26:51.459
She wants to see you.

26:51.460 --> 26:52.419
I don't want to seeher,
the whingeing old bitch.

26:52.910 --> 26:54.909
She asked me to bring ya,

26:54.910 --> 26:56.629
and I'm bringing ya.

26:56.630 --> 26:58.989
All right.
Liam, Liam, wait, wait, wait.

26:58.990 --> 27:01.189
Look, I can't stand it over there.

27:01.190 --> 27:03.909
The sight of Jonty
makes me fucking heave

27:03.910 --> 27:05.869
and there's this, like, this smell...

27:05.870 --> 27:09.869
She's giving me a lecture on how
to succeed in life, and I've got
to sit there listening to that.

27:09.900 --> 27:11.619
If I've got to suffer, so have you.

27:11.620 --> 27:12.699
I've got a date - I'm on a promise.

27:12.700 --> 27:15.419
I've got a date - I'm on a promise.
She can wait.

27:15.420 --> 27:18.539
Fuck!

27:18.540 --> 27:21.099
I was hasty when I saw you last time,

27:21.100 --> 27:24.699
unfeeling...
And for that, I apologise.

27:24.700 --> 27:27.059
I just... Oh, it was like

27:27.060 --> 27:30.779
me whole life was crashing in
around me.

27:30.780 --> 27:32.899
I'm not interested
in your sob stories, Vernon.

27:32.900 --> 27:36.379
Nothing you can say
I haven't heard before.

27:36.380 --> 27:39.419
No, but life's on the up now, Nin.

27:39.420 --> 27:43.419
Yeah!

27:43.700 --> 27:45.539
I met someone.

27:45.540 --> 27:48.899
Someone special, you know, decent,

27:48.900 --> 27:52.459
and she makes me feel
like I want to change.

27:52.460 --> 27:54.019
Be a better man, you know?

27:54.020 --> 27:55.939
Has he dropped any Es lately?

27:55.940 --> 27:59.939
Clean as a whistle.
Got a date later.

28:01.380 --> 28:05.059
Pass me my bag, will you, Liam?

28:05.060 --> 28:06.739
Ta. >

28:06.740 --> 28:09.419
So...you think she's the one, eh?

28:09.420 --> 28:11.059
She'soneof the ones.

28:11.060 --> 28:13.539
I have never felt this way before.

28:13.540 --> 28:15.539
I feel younger.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.099
You know, optimistic.

28:17.100 --> 28:20.259
Energised. Positive. You know?

28:20.260 --> 28:24.019
Take her somewhere special.

28:24.020 --> 28:28.019
Go on.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.579
Cheers, Nin. I will.

28:29.580 --> 28:33.579
Liam, get me a glass
of water, will you,
and the tablets on my bedside table?

28:36.660 --> 28:38.939
Thank you so much for this, Nin.

28:38.940 --> 28:40.659
Think of the cash as payment.

28:40.660 --> 28:42.499
For what?

28:42.500 --> 28:46.139
For being my witness.

28:46.140 --> 28:50.139
Fucking hell! No! No!

28:50.980 --> 28:54.979
They're going to ask who did it, and
you're going to tell 'em it was me.

28:56.060 --> 28:59.899
You just...

28:59.900 --> 29:03.899
Fucking selfish...or what?!
I'm going to be late for Libby now.

29:06.380 --> 29:07.859
Is Liam OK?

29:07.860 --> 29:11.659
He's ten, for God's sake.
He shouldn't be here.

29:11.660 --> 29:13.579
He's fine. And he's 11.

29:13.580 --> 29:14.819
I need to see him, check he's OK.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.579
You're going nowhere.

29:17.580 --> 29:19.699
Look, I've been through
a nightmare here.

29:19.700 --> 29:21.379
My son...

29:21.380 --> 29:25.379
my te...eleven-year-old son has
seen things no kid should see.

29:26.220 --> 29:30.219
You're expecting us to believe
that a frail old lady in her 80s
killed her own husband?

29:31.140 --> 29:34.059
Look, Nin...

29:34.060 --> 29:38.059
She was under an incredible amount
of strain, looking after a man

29:38.660 --> 29:42.659
who didn't know his arse from his
elbow and couldn't wipe either
if he wanted to. Right?

29:43.620 --> 29:47.139
She tried, with no back-up

29:47.140 --> 29:49.579
from anti-social services,

29:49.580 --> 29:53.579
no meals on wheels,
no help at all and...

29:57.700 --> 29:59.899
You're not thinking Liam did it?

29:59.900 --> 30:03.899
We're thinkingyoudid.

30:07.620 --> 30:11.579
So where did Joseph come from?

30:11.580 --> 30:14.259
Grandad.

30:14.260 --> 30:15.859
Grandad Joey.

30:15.860 --> 30:17.419
Treated me like a princess.

30:17.420 --> 30:20.899
When Mum and Dad
were at each other's throats...

30:20.900 --> 30:23.579
I dunno,
it must have been a telepathy.

30:23.580 --> 30:27.059
He'd come round and
he'd take me away from it all.

30:27.060 --> 30:29.619
He made me feel special.

30:29.620 --> 30:33.619
I just thought that'd be nice.

30:48.180 --> 30:52.179
If I ever find out you're lying,
Karen...

31:04.140 --> 31:05.859
About fuckin' time!

31:05.860 --> 31:09.859
They had to wait for forensic
before they could release you.
Had to check the gun for prints.

31:10.340 --> 31:14.139
They're building the gallows,
giving pissin' Pierrepoint a ring!

31:14.140 --> 31:18.139
And you... Why were you so slow
in telling them what happened,
you selfish little twat?!

31:18.340 --> 31:22.339
Hang on a minute!

31:27.660 --> 31:31.659
Bus fare?

31:45.140 --> 31:47.459
She walks in beauty

31:47.460 --> 31:51.459
Like the night of cloudless climes
and starry skies...

31:53.860 --> 31:57.859
(BOTH) And all that's best of dark
and bright meet in her aspect

32:01.060 --> 32:05.059
And her eyes thus mellowed
to that tender night

32:07.140 --> 32:11.139
which heaven to gaudy day denies.

32:16.860 --> 32:18.859
Hardly a glass slipper.

32:18.860 --> 32:21.979
I'm hardly Prince Charming.

32:21.980 --> 32:25.499
It doesn't bother you, does it,
that...that I've got kids?

32:25.500 --> 32:27.619
I mean, I can always trace their mum.

32:27.620 --> 32:30.339
You're all give, give, give,

32:30.340 --> 32:31.939
just like me.

32:31.940 --> 32:34.099
Wouldn't mind a turn at taking.

32:34.100 --> 32:38.099
Hey, how about we learn together?

32:39.220 --> 32:41.419
I want passion, Frank.

32:41.420 --> 32:43.459
Excitement, adrenalin.

32:43.460 --> 32:46.539
I want to wake up in the morning not
knowing what the day has to offer,

32:46.540 --> 32:50.259
and if you can't give me that,
then you're not the man for me.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.219
I am that man.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.779
Talk's cheap.

32:53.780 --> 32:57.779
How about we dance naked
till the sun comes up?

32:58.540 --> 33:00.059
I'm due at work at eight.

33:00.060 --> 33:03.259
Then there's the protest
straight after tea.

33:03.260 --> 33:05.099
Oh, the library protest, yeah.

33:05.100 --> 33:08.259
I will not be ignored, Frank.
Not this time.

33:08.260 --> 33:11.219
Let's make the bastards
sit up and take notice.

33:11.220 --> 33:14.819
Let's not wave our banners
but set the place alight.

33:14.820 --> 33:18.819
Ask for them to leave our
library alone? No, wetellthem!

33:19.780 --> 33:22.139
We dictate the conditions.

33:22.140 --> 33:26.139
This is our moment to shape history,
Libby. You with me?

33:27.100 --> 33:31.099
I want you. Now.

33:31.100 --> 33:35.099
Toilet. Two minutes.

33:43.180 --> 33:47.179
You want adrenalin, excitement...?

33:48.140 --> 33:52.139
Leg it?

33:57.460 --> 33:59.299
No-one in? Husband?

33:59.300 --> 34:01.819
Not married.

34:01.820 --> 34:02.099
Kids?

34:02.100 --> 34:04.699
Kids?
No.

34:04.700 --> 34:07.739
Is that biology or opportunity?

34:07.740 --> 34:10.219
Combination of the two.

34:10.219 --> 34:14.219
What the fuck is this?
Feckin' hell...

34:20.820 --> 34:24.418
I'm not your first, am I? Cos
I don't think I've got the time to...

34:24.420 --> 34:28.418
No, no, it's just that this
particular book's not had
its spine bent in quite a while.

34:31.620 --> 34:34.659
One shade the more, one ray the less

34:34.659 --> 34:38.659
Had half impaired
the nameless grace
Which waves with every raven tress,
or softly lightens o'er her...face.

34:46.820 --> 34:48.018
Look, just...

34:48.020 --> 34:51.018
I thought you were
a man of passion, Frank?

34:51.020 --> 34:52.819
Well, I've had my moments, yeah.

34:52.820 --> 34:54.418
So, surrender.

34:54.420 --> 34:58.419
Well, it's pretty hard
waving the white flag when you're
concentration's being tes

35:00.860 --> 35:04.739
Where thoughts serenely
sweet express...

35:04.740 --> 35:08.339
how pure, how dear their resting.

35:08.340 --> 35:11.819
Hang on.

35:11.820 --> 35:14.379
I'm sorry, it's just not happening.

35:14.380 --> 35:17.579
It's hard for me to maintain,
you know, interest

35:17.580 --> 35:19.739
with you droning on Byronically...

35:19.740 --> 35:23.739
Please, Frank.

35:24.340 --> 35:28.339
Please.

35:33.300 --> 35:36.059
Ooooh, yes. Oh, let me have it!

35:36.060 --> 35:39.099
Let me grab your soul away!
Let me have it!

35:39.100 --> 35:40.779
Oh, for fuck's sake!

35:40.780 --> 35:43.539
You know it's me...

35:43.540 --> 35:45.059
Cathy!

35:45.060 --> 35:49.059
(SQUEALS)

35:52.020 --> 35:56.019
Oh, fuck!

36:03.180 --> 36:07.179
(GROWLS)

36:09.940 --> 36:12.139
I thought she'd died.

36:12.140 --> 36:13.939
She's narcoleptic.

36:13.940 --> 36:16.979
Nod off at the drop of a hat.

36:16.980 --> 36:20.899
There are certain triggers,
excitement being one of them.

36:20.900 --> 36:22.419
But don't flatter yourself.

36:22.420 --> 36:25.619
She passes out on a regular basis
watching Britain's Got Talent.

36:25.620 --> 36:26.819
Get that drunk and go.

36:26.820 --> 36:28.619
I wouldn't mind seeing how she is.

36:28.620 --> 36:31.379
No, you won't be seeing her again.
You're no good for her

36:31.380 --> 36:32.659
and she's no good for you.

36:32.660 --> 36:33.899
I like her.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.059
You don't know her.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.299
I like what I know.

36:36.300 --> 36:38.779
She'd shag anything.
You're not that special,

36:38.780 --> 36:40.219
no matter what she told you.

36:40.220 --> 36:41.899
It smacks of sincerity to me.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.939
Did she tell you of
her broken engagement?

36:44.940 --> 36:48.379
The half-caste lad from Liverpool,
who married another woman

36:48.380 --> 36:51.499
so he could inherit a fortune,
broke our Libby's heart?

36:51.500 --> 36:54.139
Yeah, she told me on
the way over here.

36:54.140 --> 36:55.739
That's Scousers for ya.

36:55.740 --> 36:58.659
It's the plot of Wuthering Heights.

36:58.660 --> 37:01.459
Hasn't got a life of her own,
so she lives other people's.

37:01.460 --> 37:04.059
Told me once she was up the duff.

37:04.060 --> 37:08.059
Taken advantage of by a local
landowner after a charity dance.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.619
I said, "You stop
right there, lady."

37:11.620 --> 37:13.939
Tess Of The D'Urbervilles
had been on the telly

37:13.940 --> 37:17.939
the week before and it
had addled her brain.

37:19.100 --> 37:20.459
Thanks for the tea.

37:20.460 --> 37:22.619
Forget her. Move on.
It'll end in tears.

37:22.620 --> 37:25.259
Oh, yeah and what's
that the plot of, then?

37:25.260 --> 37:27.419
I want better for my daughter.

37:27.420 --> 37:30.379
You want better for yourself,
cos you know if she actually

37:30.380 --> 37:32.659
got a life of her own,
yours is as good as over.

37:32.660 --> 37:33.659
I'm her anchor.

37:33.660 --> 37:34.579
I'm her anchor.
Millstone.

37:34.580 --> 37:36.499
I'm her anchor.
Millstone.
She'd be lost without me.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.339
She'd thrive without you!

37:38.340 --> 37:41.299
I'm warning you!

37:41.300 --> 37:44.859
She's the first bit of light
I have had in my grey life

37:44.860 --> 37:48.859
for a very long time, and if you
think I'm going to let you cast

37:50.340 --> 37:54.339
your wizened, selfish, gnarled,
bitter little shadow over this,

37:54.340 --> 37:56.219
you are sadly mistaken.

37:56.220 --> 37:58.619
You don't scare me.

37:58.620 --> 38:01.099
Ditto. Now fuck off, Ironside.

38:01.100 --> 38:05.099
Ooh!

38:09.620 --> 38:13.459
Oh, how are you?
I haven't seen you for donkey's.

38:13.460 --> 38:15.739
I'm great, Nin.
It's you I'm worried about.

38:15.740 --> 38:18.979
Oh, me?
Don't you worry about me.

38:18.980 --> 38:20.779
I know what I'm doing.

38:20.780 --> 38:22.939
We just wanted to make
sure you were OK.

38:22.940 --> 38:24.939
Fine.

38:24.940 --> 38:28.939
I'm fine. Oh, I know some people
think what I did was wrong but...

38:30.780 --> 38:34.779
Jonty had no real quality of life,
which meant I didn't either.

38:35.460 --> 38:37.139
We had a word with your lawyer.

38:37.140 --> 38:40.859
He reckons you could be out in two
years. Extenuating circumstances.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.979
You can come and stay with us.

38:42.980 --> 38:45.299
I like it here.

38:45.300 --> 38:48.939
It's warm.
My room mate's very nice.

38:48.940 --> 38:50.979
And they do courses! Imagine!

38:50.980 --> 38:54.419
Nin, you don't have to stay.
With good behaviour...

38:54.420 --> 38:58.419
I'm a Gallagher.
We've never been one for behaving.

38:59.260 --> 39:03.259
All I've got to do is make sure
I never get out. Never.

39:08.900 --> 39:10.819
Now that's your cue to get out.

39:10.820 --> 39:14.819
ALARM BELLS

39:42.000 --> 39:44.319
No credit.

39:44.320 --> 39:45.799
Explain.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.079
The only time I see you
with a smile on your face

39:48.080 --> 39:49.639
is when you're after something.

39:49.640 --> 39:52.359
And aren't we a proper
little ray of fuckin' sunshine?

39:52.360 --> 39:53.479
What are you on?

39:53.480 --> 39:54.639
Nothing.

39:54.640 --> 39:55.719
High on something.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.359
Life. Love.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.919
Should try it.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.719
Seven seventy-five.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.199
You may not have the empire
of a Shirley Porter,

40:03.200 --> 40:05.359
the business acumen
of a Lord Sainsbury,

40:05.360 --> 40:09.359
your establishment has the aesthetic
appeal of the Beirut branch of Netto

40:09.680 --> 40:13.679
but...you still have
the love of a good man, agreed?

40:16.400 --> 40:17.319
Well. Yeah.

40:17.320 --> 40:21.319
What more do you need?

40:22.320 --> 40:26.319
Thank you.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.479
Oh. You. Fucking cu...

40:34.480 --> 40:38.479
PASSIONATE GROANING

40:55.480 --> 40:56.679
Sorry about the bike.

40:56.680 --> 40:59.119
Put the feelers out
for another one, eh?

40:59.120 --> 41:02.399
Does nothing ever
trouble your conscience?

41:02.400 --> 41:06.399
Eh, listen, son, I negotiate my way
through life's moral maze with ease.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.919
So...

41:13.920 --> 41:15.119
For the demo.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.919
All this effort.

41:16.920 --> 41:20.919
Hope she's worth it.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.399
Yeah, yeah, she is.

41:23.400 --> 41:26.399
Makes little Frank feel
like he's 17 again.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.559
You know what I mean?

41:28.560 --> 41:30.199
Hang on, hang on!

41:30.200 --> 41:33.639
Something you don't know
anything about yet, sunshine,

41:33.640 --> 41:36.079
is the union between
a man and a woman.

41:36.080 --> 41:39.799
I've known about it for years, the
walls in this house are paper thin.

41:39.800 --> 41:42.319
Yeah, but you never experienced it.

41:42.320 --> 41:45.959
Came close.
When we shared that bunk in Pwhelli.

41:45.960 --> 41:49.559
You see, I've met someone

41:49.560 --> 41:52.959
who inspires, ignites,

41:52.960 --> 41:56.839
lights a flamein my soul.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.399
And goes like a rabbit.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.959
Yeah, that too, yeah.

41:59.960 --> 42:03.239
But, you know, this is different.

42:03.240 --> 42:07.239
You know, it's in it's infancy...

42:07.880 --> 42:11.359
..but I know that it's something

42:11.360 --> 42:15.359
that I want to pursue,
you know, nurture.

42:20.080 --> 42:22.759
How do I look?

42:22.760 --> 42:26.759
Desperate.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.799
BICYCLE BELL

42:30.800 --> 42:32.279
What do you think?

42:32.280 --> 42:36.279
35, like we said?

42:41.760 --> 42:44.799
(ALL)What do we want? Libraries.
When do we want them? Now!

42:44.800 --> 42:47.839
What do we want? Libraries.
When do we want them? Now!

42:47.840 --> 42:51.839
More reading, less breeding!
More reading, less breeding!

42:54.760 --> 42:57.119
The rover returns!

42:57.120 --> 43:01.119
You can't get rid of me that easily,
Miss Croker, I know where you live.

43:01.720 --> 43:05.519
What do we want? Libraries.
When do we want them? Now!

43:05.520 --> 43:09.039
I knew the second from I set eyes
on you. I knew you were the one.

43:09.040 --> 43:11.239
Do you believe in destiny, Frank?

43:11.240 --> 43:15.239
Well, I'm more of a random
sequence of events man, meself,

43:15.880 --> 43:19.879
but I can see the attraction
of believing that certain happenings

43:20.600 --> 43:23.999
are preordained, yeah.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.279
GLASS BREAKS

43:25.280 --> 43:26.959
Fucking bastard!

43:26.960 --> 43:28.759
Shit.

43:28.760 --> 43:32.759
Send for backup.
Get the TAU now!

43:51.880 --> 43:55.479
Listen to me, Frank. This is it,
our moment to shape history!

43:55.480 --> 43:57.239
It's our moment to do a runner.

43:57.240 --> 44:01.079
Take this time and shape it, Frank.
Make a stand, make a mark,

44:01.080 --> 44:04.719
do something that matters.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.479
Stay, Frank.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.999
I'll make it worth your while.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.999
Oh!

44:14.360 --> 44:18.359
MOURNFUL MUSIC

44:30.280 --> 44:34.279
POLICE SIRENS

44:39.760 --> 44:41.159
No!

44:41.160 --> 44:45.159
No!

44:47.680 --> 44:50.079
Libby!

44:50.080 --> 44:52.799
Frank!

44:52.800 --> 44:56.799
Libby...

45:00.440 --> 45:04.279
Fuck's sake, Dad. Apologising to
coppers and assuring them you'll

45:04.280 --> 45:06.039
keep out of trouble in the future?

45:06.040 --> 45:09.239
Well, I am sorry for having a pulse.
Thinking there's a cause

45:09.240 --> 45:11.999
worth fighting for,
not thinking about myself

45:12.000 --> 45:14.039
for once but for the greater good.

45:14.040 --> 45:17.759
So did you get your end away?

45:17.760 --> 45:18.799
It was a bit public.

45:18.800 --> 45:22.799
Where is she?

45:22.880 --> 45:26.559
She won't get bail.
She won't get out.

45:26.560 --> 45:30.559
At least not for a good few months.

45:34.440 --> 45:38.439
Is she worth waiting for?

45:47.320 --> 45:48.959
Come on.

45:48.960 --> 45:50.639
On reflection,

45:50.640 --> 45:54.639
I'd say there's a certain amount of
selfishness necessary for survival.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.359
Like when you're flying
and they say in the safety demo,

45:58.360 --> 46:00.159
"In the event of a decompression,

46:00.160 --> 46:04.159
"help children and others only after
you've put on your own oxygen mask."

46:04.360 --> 46:06.319
You've got to look after yourself

46:06.320 --> 46:08.919
before you can even begin
to look after others.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.759
It's all about balance.

46:10.760 --> 46:12.679
That's the trick.

46:12.680 --> 46:14.959
Get that right
and you've cracked it.

46:14.960 --> 46:18.239
Once upon a time,
there was a king...

46:18.240 --> 46:22.199
I want Manchester to know
that Maguire and Sons
are back in business.

46:22.200 --> 46:24.839
This is Back Door Bertie.

46:24.840 --> 46:26.479
Our mutual fuck buddy.

46:26.480 --> 46:28.319
Start small. Work your way up.

46:28.320 --> 46:31.599
Heard the latest from your mother?
We've been dumped as godparents.

46:31.600 --> 46:35.519
I didn't do it to hurt Kelly, son.

46:35.520 --> 46:36.879
Who the fuck am I?

46:36.880 --> 46:39.959
I'm here about my dad. He's missing.

46:39.960 --> 46:41.759
HOOTER BLOWS

46:41.760 --> 46:45.759
I'm a prostitute, Father.
I don't actually believe in God.

46:46.400 --> 46:47.519
You've got...

46:47.520 --> 46:51.519
GUN FIRES

47:34.320 --> 47:36.279
Lamb stew, lamb hotpot, lambcurry.

47:36.280 --> 47:38.879
Don't you think we should
have a bit more variety?

47:38.880 --> 47:40.919
I'm trying to make
sure that they have

47:40.920 --> 47:44.919
a bit of meat and
twoveg inside them.
