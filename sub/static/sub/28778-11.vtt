WEBVTT

00:00.430 --> 00:02.252
My name is Danny McNamara.

00:02.258 --> 00:03.719
When I left the FBI, I thought

00:03.726 --> 00:06.080
my crime-fighting days were
over, but then I learned

00:06.086 --> 00:08.603
that terrorist Karim Farouk
was on the hunt for Cleopatra,

00:08.609 --> 00:10.677
one of the world's
most valuable treasures,

00:10.683 --> 00:12.418
lost for over 2,000 years,

00:12.424 --> 00:14.488
to use her as part of a
massive terror attack.

00:14.494 --> 00:16.450
To find him, I needed some help,

00:16.456 --> 00:18.599
so I went to Lexi Vaziri, a thief.

00:18.605 --> 00:21.240
Excuse me, a master thief.

00:21.246 --> 00:23.499
And my father was killed by Farouk.

00:23.505 --> 00:24.852
I wanted justice.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.103
Lexi wanted revenge.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.444
But neither of us got what we wanted.

00:28.450 --> 00:30.464
Farouk was killed before
we could catch him.

00:30.470 --> 00:33.186
Farouk may be dead,

00:33.192 --> 00:35.405
but his plan for a
massive attack lives on.

00:35.411 --> 00:37.897
And his crew is still out there.

00:40.106 --> 00:42.200
Previously on Blood & Treasure...

00:42.206 --> 00:44.472
This means your mother
was a direct descendant

00:44.478 --> 00:46.444
in the bloodline of Cleopatra.

00:46.450 --> 00:47.617
And so are you.

00:47.623 --> 00:49.951
Your future is our future.

00:49.957 --> 00:51.224
No, thanks.

00:51.553 --> 00:53.287
Just tell us where Cleopatra is.

00:53.293 --> 00:55.053
Ask Everado Sanchez.

00:55.059 --> 00:56.626
He has her, and good riddance.

00:56.632 --> 00:57.732
The narco.

00:59.030 --> 01:00.629
The death of Captain Fabi

01:00.635 --> 01:01.849
is carabinieri business.

01:01.855 --> 01:03.022
We will take care of it.

01:03.028 --> 01:04.569
I broke into Fabi's apartment

01:04.575 --> 01:06.860
and I stole a bunch of
secret files from his office.

01:06.866 --> 01:09.780
Fabi was investigating
something before he died.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.886
A different angle on Farouk.

01:11.954 --> 01:13.254
I think he found something out.

01:13.260 --> 01:14.660
They tracked Farouk's men.

01:14.666 --> 01:16.801
So we have to assume that Farouk's crew

01:16.807 --> 01:18.154
is carrying on with his plan.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.628
And now they've got a biological weapon.

01:27.874 --> 01:30.166
_

01:30.172 --> 01:34.075
This is not goodbye, my love. Hmm?

01:34.413 --> 01:36.748
Papa, I'm scared.

01:36.754 --> 01:37.968
Mira...

01:38.132 --> 01:41.449
everything I do,
everything I've ever done,

01:41.455 --> 01:43.089
is for this family.

01:45.087 --> 01:46.988
Don Everado... the soldiers are coming.

01:46.994 --> 01:48.394
We have to leave now.

01:48.710 --> 01:49.849
Start the plane.

01:49.855 --> 01:50.913
Sí, padrón.

01:54.223 --> 01:56.759
Will you be leaving us forever, papa?

01:56.765 --> 01:58.933
This is only a short trip for business.

01:58.939 --> 02:00.573
I will be back very soon.

02:00.579 --> 02:01.906
Promise?

02:04.029 --> 02:06.062
Sí, mi corazón.

02:12.214 --> 02:15.183
Papa, who is she?

02:15.251 --> 02:17.352
Her name is Cleopatra.

02:17.358 --> 02:20.461
Once she was the greatest
queen in all the world.

02:20.467 --> 02:22.769
As beautiful as you.

02:23.974 --> 02:25.576
I will protect her.

02:25.582 --> 02:28.396
And one day, she will be yours.

02:28.464 --> 02:30.832
Queen Soledad!

02:35.271 --> 02:37.839
I will return soon!

02:37.907 --> 02:39.707
I promise!

_

03:15.266 --> 03:17.627
Be very careful with that.

03:17.633 --> 03:19.567
It's highly toxic.

03:26.578 --> 03:29.213
We barely escaped in time.
They're closing in.

03:29.219 --> 03:31.287
We should go underground.

03:31.293 --> 03:33.557
Come out of hiding when the heat is off.

03:33.563 --> 03:35.425
The plan doesn't change.

03:35.431 --> 03:37.865
I followed Farouk. Not you!

03:44.822 --> 03:46.723
Farouk is dead.

03:47.276 --> 03:49.244
But the attack will proceed.

03:49.373 --> 03:51.374
You're being paid by the
same person as before.

03:51.380 --> 03:53.114
Nothing changes.

03:53.182 --> 03:54.315
Get moving.

03:58.985 --> 04:01.025
_

04:01.031 --> 04:03.124
I've never been in a museum off hours

04:03.130 --> 04:05.097
when I wasn't stealing from it.

04:05.103 --> 04:06.594
It's rather peaceful.

04:06.662 --> 04:08.830
Yeah, it's amazing how
much you can enjoy a place

04:08.897 --> 04:10.765
when you're not running
from security guards.

04:10.771 --> 04:12.988
If you do it right, the guards
never know you're there.

04:12.994 --> 04:14.530
But point taken.

04:14.536 --> 04:16.022
Speaking of guards, does Reece

04:16.028 --> 04:17.810
already know about the bio-threat?

04:17.873 --> 04:19.850
No, no, this is standard for protecting

04:19.856 --> 04:21.781
an antiquity as important as Antony.

04:21.786 --> 04:23.112
But we need to warn him about

04:23.118 --> 04:24.702
Farouk's men making a move.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.274
Let them pass, they're with us.

04:27.618 --> 04:29.617
Well, you've had an
interesting few weeks.

04:29.685 --> 04:31.119
Hey, tell me about it, man.

04:31.186 --> 04:32.520
Lexi, this is Rick Yates,

04:32.533 --> 04:33.967
Reece's head of security.

04:33.973 --> 04:36.041
Rick, this is... Lexi Vaziri.

04:36.138 --> 04:37.838
Mr. Reece mentioned me.

04:37.844 --> 04:39.527
More like warned me about...

04:39.595 --> 04:41.963
but he has come around on you, somewhat.

04:41.969 --> 04:43.259
As have I, him.

04:45.095 --> 04:47.363
You know, when you're in a relationship,

04:47.369 --> 04:49.358
friends and family are
part of the package.

04:49.364 --> 04:50.838
Kind of like cousins

04:50.844 --> 04:52.368
who visit each other at holidays.

04:52.374 --> 04:54.003
I don't need to check
my cousins' pockets

04:54.009 --> 04:55.547
when they leave the room.

04:56.023 --> 04:58.646
Well, if it isn't our
heroes of the hour.

04:58.714 --> 05:00.198
Great to have you back, Danny.

05:00.204 --> 05:01.347
Dr. Castillo.

05:01.353 --> 05:02.620
- Danny.
- Hey.

05:02.751 --> 05:06.187
Oh... Jay called me the moment
Antony was recovered.

05:06.193 --> 05:08.017
Actually, more begged than just called.

05:08.023 --> 05:09.390
I had to see him for myself.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.353
The two of you are
going down in history.

05:11.359 --> 05:13.821
- Dr. Castillo.
- Oh, looks like I'm needed.

05:13.827 --> 05:16.331
This is so exciting.

05:16.398 --> 05:19.634
I've convinced Ana to stay,
oversee the restoration.

05:19.640 --> 05:20.897
Arrangements are underway

05:20.903 --> 05:24.205
for a public unveiling
in Cairo next week.

05:26.892 --> 05:29.744
Um... okay, so I've
worked my entire life

05:29.812 --> 05:31.312
for this very moment,

05:31.318 --> 05:34.318
and you two look like I've
just run over your dog.

05:34.324 --> 05:35.557
What's going on?

05:35.563 --> 05:38.486
Jay, we need to move Antony
to a secure location.

05:39.163 --> 05:41.656
See... uh, I'm not sure you've noticed,

05:41.662 --> 05:44.734
but we are surrounded
literally by an army.

05:44.740 --> 05:46.361
Farouk's latest base of operations

05:46.367 --> 05:48.104
had traces of a bio-agent.

05:48.831 --> 05:50.345
He was developing a weapon.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.104
His crew is still out there.

05:52.110 --> 05:53.401
They're not giving up on his plan,

05:53.407 --> 05:54.540
and as far as we know,

05:54.546 --> 05:56.780
that means they want
Antony and Cleopatra.

05:56.972 --> 05:58.873
They're coming for Antony.

06:00.943 --> 06:04.112
Double our security immediately
and call the prime minister.

06:04.118 --> 06:05.842
Make sure that we're
all in communication

06:05.848 --> 06:09.248
about any threats in the
area, I do not care how small.

06:09.845 --> 06:10.978
Okay, kid, don't worry.

06:10.984 --> 06:12.673
We'll put Antony on lockdown.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.189
Meanwhile, any leads on Cleopatra?

06:15.195 --> 06:16.915
Well, the last of the Nazis sold her off

06:16.921 --> 06:18.621
to a drug dealer in the '90s.

06:18.627 --> 06:20.762
I just said that out loud.

06:20.768 --> 06:22.273
Everado Sanchez disappeared,

06:22.279 --> 06:23.993
but I have a friend in the FBI

06:23.999 --> 06:25.651
that can help us track him down.

06:25.657 --> 06:26.925
Then keep me posted.

06:26.931 --> 06:29.499
But... just be careful.

06:29.505 --> 06:31.406
- Yeah.
- Both of you.

06:41.312 --> 06:42.862
How long you gonna keep me here?

06:42.868 --> 06:44.113
I want to go home.

06:44.119 --> 06:46.387
I'm sorry for the delay, Mr. Hardwick.

06:46.455 --> 06:48.156
You'll be on your way
as soon as possible.

06:48.162 --> 06:49.396
And will you be supplying me

06:49.402 --> 06:51.953
with any form of police
protection when you let me go?

06:53.095 --> 06:55.563
I mean, Farouk's men are
still out there, aren't they?

06:55.631 --> 06:57.231
I've got more than a sneaking suspicion

06:57.237 --> 06:59.572
that they're gonna come after
me because I killed him.

06:59.578 --> 07:01.053
No one outside this building knows your

07:01.059 --> 07:02.565
involvement apart from Danny and Lexi.

07:02.571 --> 07:04.027
We're keeping it out of the news.

07:04.033 --> 07:06.502
The Italians have offered
you a hotel room here in Rome

07:06.508 --> 07:08.609
with a police detail
until this is resolved.

07:08.615 --> 07:09.814
How comforting.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.913
I don't suppose I could put in a request

07:11.919 --> 07:13.720
for the Palazzo Naiadi, could I?

07:13.849 --> 07:16.150
We'll see what can be arranged.

07:18.654 --> 07:21.248
Now, I need to talk to you
about another matter...

07:22.658 --> 07:24.740
Related to the Farouk case.

07:25.861 --> 07:29.430
This check was written out

07:29.436 --> 07:30.936
to a Zara Farouk.

07:32.017 --> 07:33.801
Is that a name you ever heard of,

07:33.869 --> 07:35.970
perhaps in your time in captivity?

07:36.038 --> 07:37.638
I don't understand.

07:37.706 --> 07:41.008
I... I thought "Karim Farouk"
was just a nom de guerre

07:41.076 --> 07:43.311
for Rasheed Hegazi.

07:45.865 --> 07:48.066
Look, I want to help you.

07:48.517 --> 07:50.980
I really do, but I'm afraid.

07:52.254 --> 07:55.156
And I'm afraid because
in my year of captivity,

07:55.224 --> 07:57.492
it seemed to me that Karim Farouk

07:57.498 --> 07:59.233
was protected by some very

07:59.239 --> 08:01.440
powerful people in high places.

08:01.563 --> 08:04.198
Anybody that got too close
to the truth about him

08:04.266 --> 08:06.667
or his past were dealt with severely.

08:06.735 --> 08:08.135
Before they were killed.

08:08.203 --> 08:10.505
He may be dead...

08:10.572 --> 08:13.536
But the people protecting
him are still out there.

08:13.816 --> 08:15.340
So...

08:16.845 --> 08:18.563
If I were you...

08:19.948 --> 08:21.349
I'd be very careful

08:21.676 --> 08:23.421
about opening any doors,

08:23.427 --> 08:25.057
because you have no idea

08:25.063 --> 08:27.264
who may be standing on the other side.

08:29.591 --> 08:32.527
I had to pull a few strings
at the FBI to get that.

08:32.594 --> 08:34.861
The United States government
isn't exactly too keen

08:34.868 --> 08:36.424
on discussing Sanchez.

08:36.431 --> 08:37.899
Why is that?

08:37.966 --> 08:39.833
Sanchez was the biggest
narco in the world.

08:39.902 --> 08:42.035
Worth billions with
a rap sheet for days.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.837
DEA spent millions of dollars,

08:43.842 --> 08:45.973
thousands of man-hours finding him.

08:45.979 --> 08:47.603
Just as they had him cornered,

08:47.609 --> 08:49.176
vanished into thin air.

08:49.244 --> 08:51.012
Biggest botch in DEA history.

08:51.079 --> 08:53.347
I think I might have an idea

08:53.642 --> 08:55.510
what might've been there.

08:57.065 --> 08:59.132
Cleopatra's coffin.

08:59.138 --> 09:00.546
Given his appetite for

09:00.552 --> 09:02.141
anything he could make money on,

09:02.147 --> 09:04.014
and his connection to
Steiner, it's not a leap.

09:04.020 --> 09:06.455
Where was the last place
Sanchez was known to be?

09:06.461 --> 09:07.862
He switched off his transponder

09:07.930 --> 09:09.764
when he stopped to refuel in Panama.

09:09.831 --> 09:11.265
Wherever he was headed...

09:11.333 --> 09:13.267
No one's ever seen him
or his plane again.

09:13.724 --> 09:15.692
But I do have this:

09:15.698 --> 09:19.140
DEA wiretaps of Sanchez. All of them.

09:19.207 --> 09:20.975
Including his final call from Panama

09:21.043 --> 09:24.245
to his lieutenant
Miguel Navarro in 1993.

09:24.251 --> 09:25.688
How's your Spanish?

09:25.694 --> 09:27.949
Better than her Serbian,
worse than her Italian.

09:30.592 --> 09:32.557
_

09:32.565 --> 09:34.034
_

09:34.059 --> 09:36.809
_

09:36.815 --> 09:38.687
_

09:38.693 --> 09:41.797
_

09:41.803 --> 09:44.141
_

09:44.147 --> 09:46.565
_

09:46.584 --> 09:49.321
_

09:49.337 --> 09:53.526
_

09:53.784 --> 09:58.268
_

09:58.274 --> 10:01.460
_

10:01.466 --> 10:03.666
_

10:03.719 --> 10:06.855
Miguel! Miguel!

10:07.004 --> 10:08.689
What the hell happened?

10:08.695 --> 10:10.481
Once Everado fled, the rival cartels

10:10.487 --> 10:12.321
took out the rest of his crew.

10:12.327 --> 10:14.295
That's the last we heard of him.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.150
And what happened to his family?

10:16.156 --> 10:18.766
They fled to Europe,
living off a nice nest egg

10:18.772 --> 10:20.005
Sanchez left for them.

10:20.011 --> 10:21.678
Wife died a few years back.

10:21.870 --> 10:24.705
Last I heard, his daughter
Soledad was living in Italy.

10:24.773 --> 10:26.371
Exact address is unknown.

10:26.377 --> 10:28.537
She kept a low profile
from rival cartels.

10:28.543 --> 10:30.311
It looks like Carlo Velardi

10:30.317 --> 10:32.742
used to do business with
Sanchez back in the '80s.

10:32.748 --> 10:34.438
Wouldn't be surprised if that's

10:34.444 --> 10:36.188
why Soledad ended up in Italy.

10:36.251 --> 10:39.720
Carlo was offering her
protection, which means

10:39.788 --> 10:41.288
he might know where she is.

10:41.356 --> 10:42.657
Worth a shot.

10:42.663 --> 10:44.742
He said he owed us for helping
catch his son's killer.

10:44.748 --> 10:47.302
Calling in favors from
convicted mobsters

10:47.308 --> 10:49.688
is where I get off the train,

10:49.694 --> 10:51.516
but you kids knock yourselves out.

10:51.522 --> 10:52.789
Thanks, Harper.

10:52.795 --> 10:56.837
Oh, and try not to leave too
much destruction in your wake.

11:01.178 --> 11:03.112
Gwen? Hi.

11:03.118 --> 11:05.452
Does the name Zara Farouk ring a bell?

11:05.458 --> 11:07.252
Besides the obvious part,

11:07.258 --> 11:10.124
- about her last name?
- No, never heard it. Why?

11:10.130 --> 11:12.856
Fabi was looking into a money
trail from a shell company

11:12.862 --> 11:14.396
to somebody by that name.

11:14.402 --> 11:16.563
I called the bank listed
on the transactions,

11:16.569 --> 11:18.437
but they wouldn't give
out any information,

11:18.443 --> 11:21.045
and I can't get a warrant
because the documents

11:21.051 --> 11:22.503
were procured illegally.

11:22.509 --> 11:24.443
Were they ever.

11:24.449 --> 11:26.501
I stole them, and then you did,

11:26.507 --> 11:28.816
which is, like, doubly illegal.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.292
Yes, thank you.

11:30.298 --> 11:33.367
Gwen, I just knew we
could be friends one day.

11:33.373 --> 11:34.866
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

11:34.872 --> 11:36.508
Let us know if you find anything.

11:36.514 --> 11:38.014
All right.

12:22.735 --> 12:25.602
_

12:35.007 --> 12:36.968
Look at McNamara.

12:36.974 --> 12:39.842
He doesn't even know
how to wear a shirt.

12:39.910 --> 12:42.044
Did you hear what happened to his dad?

12:42.050 --> 12:43.289
He's in jail.

12:55.459 --> 12:58.433
Yeah. I hate these things, too, huh?

13:00.427 --> 13:02.328
H-Hey...

13:02.733 --> 13:05.034
Don't let your suit define you.

13:05.102 --> 13:08.104
Okay? Not tonight. Not ever.

13:09.506 --> 13:12.903
Yeah. The Romans said
the clothes make the man.

13:15.705 --> 13:18.080
Um, and how did that work out for them?

13:20.884 --> 13:22.985
See you around, kid.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.689
The proceeds from tonight's auction

13:26.757 --> 13:29.692
go towards scholarships
for those students who have

13:29.760 --> 13:33.262
demonstrated exceptional
academic achievement.

13:33.268 --> 13:35.794
And while those students
have earned their place here,

13:35.800 --> 13:38.468
it would only be fair to say
that none of us would be here

13:38.474 --> 13:41.558
if not for the generosity of our host,

13:41.564 --> 13:43.458
the man who donated

13:43.464 --> 13:46.533
this incredible array of auction items

13:46.743 --> 13:48.811
from his own private collection.

13:48.879 --> 13:52.515
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jacob Reece.

14:08.641 --> 14:11.422
_

14:54.344 --> 14:57.513
Carlo Velardi says it's this way.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.514
Señora Soledad.

15:33.216 --> 15:35.418
I was told you have some information

15:35.424 --> 15:37.270
about my father's whereabouts.

15:37.276 --> 15:39.768
Carlo assured me you
wouldn't waste my time.

15:39.963 --> 15:42.291
We're here to prevent a terrorist group

15:42.297 --> 15:44.161
from carrying out a deadly attack.

15:44.229 --> 15:45.928
But to do that, we need to find out

15:45.934 --> 15:47.384
what happened to your father.

15:47.390 --> 15:49.799
With your help, we think we can.

15:50.901 --> 15:52.301
You have five minutes.

15:53.087 --> 15:56.572
We have the last known
recording of your father,

15:56.578 --> 15:58.497
courtesy of the DEA.

16:00.108 --> 16:02.640
_

16:07.614 --> 16:08.947
Sí.

16:10.153 --> 16:13.022
This man says that he is with you.

16:13.028 --> 16:14.459
Shaw?

16:14.465 --> 16:16.396
- Oh, God.
- What the hell are you doing here?

16:16.402 --> 16:18.522
I could ask you two the same damn thing.

16:18.528 --> 16:21.400
That doesn't make sense.
You followed us.

16:21.406 --> 16:22.539
So he is with you?

16:22.545 --> 16:23.648
- Yes.
- No.

16:23.654 --> 16:25.168
- We are done here.
- Oh, hold up...

16:25.174 --> 16:27.436
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
We know him.

16:27.442 --> 16:29.576
He just didn't come with us.

16:29.932 --> 16:31.333
Espera.

16:32.152 --> 16:33.709
And whose fault is that?

16:33.715 --> 16:36.784
You two found Antony and didn't
even bother to reach out?

16:36.790 --> 16:38.055
Antony?

16:38.316 --> 16:40.068
As in Antony and Cleopatra?

16:40.074 --> 16:42.351
- Yeah.
- Yes. That's why we're here.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.954
The terrorists we're after
are looking for Cleopatra.

16:45.021 --> 16:46.956
Now, if we can find her before they do,

16:46.962 --> 16:48.547
we can stop their attack.

16:48.553 --> 16:49.976
We have reason to suspect your

16:49.982 --> 16:51.589
father was in possession of her.

16:51.595 --> 16:53.028
He was.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.798
He was... I remember
seeing a golden coffin.

16:55.804 --> 17:00.474
Soledad, can you, can you help
us figure out where he went?

17:01.598 --> 17:04.540
You said, uh, that you had a recording?

17:06.776 --> 17:11.112
_

17:11.464 --> 17:14.124
_

17:14.147 --> 17:18.250
_

17:18.273 --> 17:23.211
_

17:23.217 --> 17:26.459
_

17:26.464 --> 17:28.800
His voice.

17:28.806 --> 17:31.532
It's been a very long time.

17:33.984 --> 17:35.671
When he was gone,

17:35.739 --> 17:38.043
his enemies tried to take out

17:38.049 --> 17:40.748
their revenge on him through us.

17:40.811 --> 17:42.574
And my mother thought that he had

17:42.580 --> 17:44.585
abandoned us like a coward.

17:44.648 --> 17:47.583
I know this doesn't answer
what happened to him,

17:47.651 --> 17:49.952
but at least you know
he was thinking of you.

17:50.887 --> 17:53.584
Do you know the book of
poems he was talking about?

17:53.590 --> 17:55.892
Of course. I have it right here.

18:03.533 --> 18:06.268
He gave it as a gift to my
mother when they first met,

18:06.274 --> 18:07.998
and he would always read

18:08.004 --> 18:11.607
to us from it and I,
I kept it all these years.

18:11.613 --> 18:12.895
The title...

18:14.277 --> 18:15.811
Deseado?

18:15.879 --> 18:18.247
It means, um, "I have desired."

18:18.315 --> 18:20.467
Deseado is also a small island

18:20.473 --> 18:22.242
in the western Sargasso Sea.

18:22.248 --> 18:24.954
Cortés discovered it on
his way to the New World.

18:26.275 --> 18:28.815
What? I-I watch a lot
of Discovery Channel.

18:28.821 --> 18:30.354
So you think Sanchez

18:30.360 --> 18:32.161
took Cleopatra to...

18:32.167 --> 18:34.101
The Bermuda Triangle.

18:34.231 --> 18:37.633
Yep. As if having a mummy's
curse on me wasn't enough.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.835
No one is asking you to go, Shaw.

18:39.841 --> 18:42.676
How do you know that this
is where my father went?

18:42.682 --> 18:45.650
Your father knew the DEA was listening.

18:45.903 --> 18:48.405
When he said you can find
me in the book of poems,

18:48.411 --> 18:50.546
he meant you can find him in Deseado.

18:50.552 --> 18:52.476
He was trying to tell you
where he was going.

18:52.482 --> 18:54.126
But if he's been alive all these years,

18:54.132 --> 18:55.770
how come he didn't try to contact us?

18:55.776 --> 18:58.069
I don't know. But whatever
happened to him,

18:58.075 --> 19:00.912
the answers are on this island.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.693
My father, he made a lot of enemies

19:04.761 --> 19:06.328
in this part of the world.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.831
It's not safe for me to join you.

19:08.899 --> 19:12.034
But should you find any information

19:12.102 --> 19:15.704
about what happened
to my father, good or bad,

19:15.772 --> 19:17.706
please, let me know.

19:17.774 --> 19:19.275
Promise.

19:19.342 --> 19:20.609
Come on!

19:20.615 --> 19:21.748
You owe me.

19:21.754 --> 19:23.445
I brought your friend
from the refugee camp

19:23.451 --> 19:26.286
all the way to Norway to
reunite with her family.

19:26.292 --> 19:28.350
And then I got snowed in for a week.

19:28.356 --> 19:29.619
Froze my ass off.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.592
Look here, see? Ooh...

19:31.598 --> 19:33.365
Hey, what are you hiding?

19:33.597 --> 19:36.184
I told you, if anything
happened to Aya, I would...

19:38.868 --> 19:41.563
Why do you look so happy?

19:42.337 --> 19:44.856
They were lovely people
and we got along very well.

19:44.862 --> 19:46.363
Is that what you wanted to hear?

19:46.369 --> 19:49.004
Fine, it was nice. And
it got me thinking about

19:49.010 --> 19:51.411
the future, building a
nest egg so maybe one day,

19:51.417 --> 19:53.718
I can settle down and
have a family, too.

19:53.724 --> 19:56.115
Shaw, what does that have
to do with going with us?

19:56.121 --> 19:58.981
I missed out on my slice of
the finder's fee for Antony,

19:58.987 --> 20:01.209
and I'll be damned if I
get cut out of Cleo, too.

20:01.215 --> 20:03.148
You had nothing to
do with finding Antony.

20:03.154 --> 20:05.828
Uh... I won't even dignify that.

20:05.834 --> 20:08.002
Bottom line, you need me.

20:08.008 --> 20:10.526
I've spent many years in
the import/export business.

20:10.532 --> 20:12.419
Much of it in the Caribbean.

20:12.425 --> 20:14.159
Got a lot of contacts down there,

20:14.165 --> 20:17.114
including one Enrique Vega in Deseado.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.402
Been there for decades,
knows every island for miles.

20:20.408 --> 20:22.803
If Sanchez went there, Vega would know.

20:22.809 --> 20:24.951
- I think he's making it up.
- Hundred percent.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.559
Need I remind you that if it weren't for

20:26.565 --> 20:28.322
my relationship with
Le Mer in Casablanca,

20:28.328 --> 20:30.346
he would've turned
you in for that bounty

20:30.352 --> 20:32.510
and you two would be sleeping
with the fishes right now.

20:32.516 --> 20:35.584
But instead, I led you
directly to Cleopatra.

20:35.590 --> 20:37.691
Go ahead. Try and deny it.

20:38.393 --> 20:40.516
- Mm-hmm. That's what I thought.
- All right.

20:40.522 --> 20:43.157
You can come along.
But I'm telling you right now,

20:43.163 --> 20:44.593
you follow our lead.

20:44.599 --> 20:46.999
- One false step, and I will...
- You won't regret it.

20:47.005 --> 20:48.639
You'll see.

20:48.645 --> 20:50.879
Hey, amigo, plane almost ready?

20:51.301 --> 20:54.470
Sí, signore. Just routine maintenance.

20:54.537 --> 20:57.443
Anybody know the snack
situation on this flight?

20:57.849 --> 21:00.401
Shaw, don't steal anything, okay?

21:00.407 --> 21:02.108
Never.

21:10.393 --> 21:13.089
_

21:26.761 --> 21:28.963
CCTV caught this outside my building.

21:28.995 --> 21:30.682
I ran it through facial recognition.

21:30.688 --> 21:33.794
Inconclusive, but I managed
to get the number plate.

21:34.067 --> 21:35.958
Put out an alert, will you?

21:36.369 --> 21:38.437
The general would like
to speak with you.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.573
I'll see him when I have a moment.

21:40.640 --> 21:41.907
It is not a request.

21:51.388 --> 21:54.023
I prefer to stand, if it's all the same.

21:54.084 --> 21:55.952
You might as well.

21:56.020 --> 21:58.254
You've been recalled to Lyon.

21:58.260 --> 21:59.677
The order came from Interpol.

21:59.683 --> 22:02.136
You leave tonight. It's out of my hands.

22:02.142 --> 22:03.593
But you could stop it.

22:03.661 --> 22:05.546
Unless you're eager
to get me out of here.

22:05.552 --> 22:07.821
Maybe because you're a
double agent of Serapis,

22:07.827 --> 22:09.494
just like Captain Fabi was.

22:09.561 --> 22:10.828
Agent Karlsson,

22:10.834 --> 22:13.136
this crazy talk about secret societies

22:13.142 --> 22:14.805
is not helping ingratiate you.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.164
Not to the carabinieri
and not to Interpol.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.805
You're becoming a laughingstock.

22:18.945 --> 22:20.505
Fabi was a corrupt cop.

22:20.511 --> 22:21.833
Nothing more.

22:21.839 --> 22:25.214
Fabi was running a parallel
investigation into Farouk.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.484
Aren't you at least a bit
curious to find out why,

22:28.552 --> 22:30.553
or what was in his secret files?

22:30.621 --> 22:32.689
The ones you stole from his apartment?

22:32.756 --> 22:36.393
Hmm? Why are you so
obsessed with Captain Fabi?

22:36.399 --> 22:37.699
Were you in love with him?

22:37.705 --> 22:40.897
No, you idiot. Fabi was my partner.

22:40.903 --> 22:43.061
And I believe Fabi found
something out about Farouk,

22:43.067 --> 22:45.368
and I want to know what it is.

22:45.374 --> 22:48.576
'Cause Karim Farouk's men are
still out there, and a threat.

22:48.582 --> 22:50.108
And following up on the evidence

22:50.114 --> 22:52.177
that Fabi found nearly got me killed.

22:52.411 --> 22:54.906
So, clearly, someone
doesn't want it out there.

22:54.912 --> 22:58.514
Maybe that means nothing to
you, but if that's the case,

22:59.499 --> 23:01.702
I don't know what the hell
you're doing in here all day,

23:01.708 --> 23:03.913
because it sure isn't police work.

23:06.398 --> 23:09.084
_

23:09.090 --> 23:10.381
Ah.

23:10.387 --> 23:11.994
The most connected man in Deseado

23:12.000 --> 23:13.453
works out of a bait shop.

23:13.459 --> 23:15.560
It's also a bar, so one way or another,

23:15.566 --> 23:17.166
everybody comes through here.

23:17.296 --> 23:20.098
Just remember, we have
to play our cards close.

23:20.104 --> 23:22.559
No one needs to know
we're looking for Sanchez.

23:23.369 --> 23:26.237
If he's still around, last
thing we want is to tip him off.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.985
Chill, man.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.742
I wasn't born yesterday.

23:39.185 --> 23:40.652
Vega.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.295
You got old, tío.

23:50.362 --> 23:53.331
You got round, hermano.

23:57.872 --> 24:00.007
What brings you back
to my little island, huh?

24:00.013 --> 24:01.747
Well, I need your help.

24:01.753 --> 24:03.422
Meet Danny and Lexi.

24:03.428 --> 24:06.385
They're bounty hunters
looking for Everado Sanchez.

24:06.453 --> 24:09.121
Everado Sanchez? Here?

24:09.189 --> 24:12.758
It's just a theory.

24:12.764 --> 24:14.822
A man like Sanchez would stick out here

24:14.828 --> 24:16.936
like a cockeyed giraffe, huh?

24:17.464 --> 24:20.733
I mean, he disappeared in, what, '92?

24:20.739 --> 24:22.015
'93.

24:22.842 --> 24:25.104
The biggest thing to
hit Deseado in the '90s

24:25.110 --> 24:26.562
were the Spice Girls.

24:26.568 --> 24:28.836
- And that mess with the money.
- What mess?

24:28.842 --> 24:31.344
One day, out of nowhere,

24:31.411 --> 24:34.480
stacks of U.S. dollars
washed up on the shore.

24:34.548 --> 24:36.551
The locals swarmed the beach,

24:36.557 --> 24:38.489
grabbing fistfuls of cash.

24:38.552 --> 24:40.393
Old people knocking down kids,

24:40.399 --> 24:42.360
kids knocking down old people.

24:42.422 --> 24:44.757
Mayhem. A local tabloid said

24:44.763 --> 24:46.661
the source of the money was

24:46.667 --> 24:48.704
the lost city of El Dorado.

24:48.829 --> 24:51.831
We had turistas coming in
from all over the world.

24:51.898 --> 24:53.966
Didn't you run the local tabloid?

24:54.034 --> 24:55.134
Made a killing.

24:55.202 --> 24:56.302
I bet you did.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.104
- Business is business.
- Yeah.

24:58.916 --> 25:00.735
Wait, yeah, wait.

25:00.741 --> 25:02.608
Uh, hey, I'll be back in a minute.

25:02.676 --> 25:04.176
Make yourself comfortable.

25:04.244 --> 25:06.054
Don't mind if I do.

25:08.849 --> 25:11.617
What part of "keep your cards close"

25:11.685 --> 25:12.952
did you not grasp?

25:12.958 --> 25:14.425
It's called trust.

25:14.431 --> 25:15.688
You should try it sometime.

25:15.694 --> 25:17.618
And what makes you
think you can trust him?

25:17.624 --> 25:20.192
Well, he happens to be my friend.

25:20.260 --> 25:23.229
A friend, who doesn't
even know your real name.

25:23.235 --> 25:25.059
Listen, he knows what he needs to know.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.033
And I know we can't make
a move in the Triangle

25:27.100 --> 25:28.334
without him hearing about it.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.870
And if he starts to
think I am withholding,

25:30.937 --> 25:32.738
he starts sniffing around,

25:32.806 --> 25:34.640
maybe he starts looking himself

25:34.708 --> 25:36.642
and finds Cleopatra before we do.

25:36.710 --> 25:38.811
I hate to admit it
but I agree with Shaw.

25:38.879 --> 25:41.547
See? Shaw knows what he's doing.

25:41.615 --> 25:42.915
B-But why do you agree?

25:42.921 --> 25:45.810
Sanchez's plane went down
in the Bermuda Triangle.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.154
We'll need to search hundreds of islands

25:48.221 --> 25:50.823
scattered across thousands of miles.

25:50.891 --> 25:52.324
We need a guide.

25:52.392 --> 25:56.228
You mean someone who's
familiar with the entire area.

25:56.296 --> 25:58.364
Someone who knows every island

25:58.432 --> 25:59.765
from here to Miami.

25:59.771 --> 26:01.261
Now, where on earth are we going to

26:01.267 --> 26:02.963
find this person on such short notice?

26:02.969 --> 26:06.423
Oh, I'm gonna remember that smug look...

26:06.429 --> 26:09.108
When this blows up in our faces.

26:09.215 --> 26:10.408
Come on, guys.

26:10.641 --> 26:12.515
It's gonna be great.

26:18.418 --> 26:21.353
So, there are a dozen
islands stretched across

26:21.421 --> 26:22.955
a gajillion kilometers.

26:22.961 --> 26:24.995
How are we gonna narrow it down?

26:25.001 --> 26:26.559
If the plane crashed nearby,

26:26.565 --> 26:28.312
the wreckage would have been found.

26:28.554 --> 26:30.491
Well, it would have
needed to have crashed

26:30.497 --> 26:32.765
somewhere uninhabited, where
no one could hear or see it,

26:32.833 --> 26:34.800
yet somewhere close enough that any cash

26:34.868 --> 26:36.268
would wash back up at Deseado.

26:36.336 --> 26:39.138
These islands are all
listed as deserted.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.640
That entire island chain was a hideout

26:41.708 --> 26:45.211
for a South American
revolutionary group in the '70s.

26:45.278 --> 26:47.379
The waters all around there are mined.

26:47.447 --> 26:49.782
No one goes there.

26:49.850 --> 26:51.973
But one of those rebels

26:51.979 --> 26:53.830
traded me a map to the mines

26:53.836 --> 26:55.488
for an outboard motor.

26:55.494 --> 26:57.662
I just hope it's still accurate.

26:58.041 --> 27:00.121
Boat's ready.

27:00.127 --> 27:02.595
Let's move. Come on,
we're burning daylight.

27:02.601 --> 27:05.603
Yeah, let's not be in
too much of a rush.

27:05.609 --> 27:07.361
Got to be on the lookout for mines.

27:08.439 --> 27:09.935
- For what?
- Hey,

27:10.003 --> 27:12.905
you were the one who
wanted to come with.

27:14.517 --> 27:16.652
It's gonna be great.

27:23.413 --> 27:25.558
This is the last beach on the island.

27:25.626 --> 27:27.894
We'd better hurry up,
the sun will be setting soon.

27:34.902 --> 27:36.836
I found something!

27:36.904 --> 27:39.906
What a find, moldy porn.

27:39.973 --> 27:42.341
Think I'll call the
National Geographic Society.

27:42.533 --> 27:43.867
Definitely makes the trip

27:43.873 --> 27:45.640
through mine-infested waters worth it.

27:45.646 --> 27:47.747
Look, March 1993.

27:48.048 --> 27:49.982
That's right when Sanchez went missing.

27:51.285 --> 27:53.252
This has to be the place.

27:59.993 --> 28:01.694
I found a wing!

28:08.602 --> 28:11.104
I think I found a piece of landing gear.

28:11.171 --> 28:14.307
There's debris scattered everywhere.

28:14.313 --> 28:17.140
Everado Sanchez's plane crashed here.

28:17.179 --> 28:19.507
If I were marooned,
the first thing I'd do

28:19.513 --> 28:21.781
would be to find shelter.

28:21.849 --> 28:24.784
Come on. Follow me.

28:27.619 --> 28:30.054
Do try and keep up, gentlemen.

29:13.767 --> 29:15.566
Maldito.

29:16.036 --> 29:17.409
Cursed.

29:18.038 --> 29:21.274
Wow, that's a lot of money.

29:35.455 --> 29:39.025
Sanchez was trapped.

29:39.092 --> 29:42.228
He couldn't get through the
minefield around the island.

29:45.766 --> 29:48.134
Couldn't get back to them.

29:53.073 --> 29:55.007
Lexi.

30:08.922 --> 30:10.723
It's her.

30:10.791 --> 30:13.159
It's really her.

30:13.165 --> 30:15.917
You know, I couldn't take it in before,

30:16.964 --> 30:19.198
but I'm somehow part of a bloodline

30:19.204 --> 30:21.906
that goes over 2,000 years.

30:23.437 --> 30:25.705
I feel it now.

30:29.109 --> 30:30.710
We did it.

30:35.949 --> 30:37.850
Well, well...

30:37.918 --> 30:39.886
Who do we have here?

30:49.677 --> 30:52.615
_

31:00.993 --> 31:03.104
_

31:06.708 --> 31:08.770
I need to make this right.

31:09.944 --> 31:12.412
She just lost her father.
Give her some time.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.948
I can give her justice.

31:15.016 --> 31:16.950
I can find Farouk.

31:17.079 --> 31:19.681
And how do you expect to do
that? The guy's a ghost now.

31:19.687 --> 31:21.224
First thing tomorrow morning,

31:21.230 --> 31:23.137
I'll go back to the crime scene,

31:23.291 --> 31:25.626
I'll comb over every last inch.

31:28.062 --> 31:30.797
Your boss, old friend of mine,

31:30.865 --> 31:35.135
told me that they're gonna
need to find a fall guy

31:35.203 --> 31:37.437
for the botched Farouk investigation.

31:37.505 --> 31:39.439
I'm sorry, Danny,

31:39.507 --> 31:41.909
but you're through there.

31:49.984 --> 31:52.452
If I'm not FBI,

31:52.520 --> 31:53.821
who am I?

31:54.656 --> 31:58.091
Hey, kid, don't let
your suit define you.

31:58.159 --> 32:00.139
You can work anywhere you want...

32:01.396 --> 32:03.330
Including for me.

32:04.971 --> 32:07.506
Come on, let's get out of here.

32:15.986 --> 32:17.606
_

32:17.612 --> 32:20.332
Yeah, that's the plate. Good work, Enzo.

32:21.636 --> 32:23.278
Is the team ready?

32:23.284 --> 32:25.285
Yes, everyone is in position.

32:25.353 --> 32:26.920
There she is.

32:29.223 --> 32:30.624
Who is she?

32:30.692 --> 32:32.192
Mercenary, probably.

32:32.260 --> 32:33.994
I'm more interested in who hired her.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.319
You recognize him?

32:35.325 --> 32:37.291
No.

32:37.297 --> 32:38.965
Go, go, go, go, go!

33:12.619 --> 33:15.270
You're making a huge mistake.

33:15.276 --> 33:17.632
Terrorists are after Cleopatra.

33:17.638 --> 33:19.006
You take her now,

33:19.012 --> 33:20.737
they're just gonna come after you.

33:20.804 --> 33:22.971
This is my world.

33:22.977 --> 33:25.512
I know this area better than anyone.

33:25.702 --> 33:27.336
I'm not so worried.

33:27.342 --> 33:30.278
- And here I thought we were friends.
- We are.

33:30.431 --> 33:32.866
Which is why I'm going to let you live.

33:32.872 --> 33:34.074
But...

33:34.922 --> 33:36.423
Business is business.

33:36.429 --> 33:38.011
Goodbye, my friend.

33:38.017 --> 33:40.927
Live a long, pleasant
life on the island.

33:43.450 --> 33:46.461
Your friend is so delightful, Shaw.

33:46.467 --> 33:48.769
Thank you very much for introducing us.

33:48.836 --> 33:50.404
You're welcome.

33:50.410 --> 33:51.748
This...

33:51.754 --> 33:53.413
Won't take but a minute.

33:54.826 --> 33:56.967
We can still catch up to them.

33:58.697 --> 34:01.064
_

35:18.793 --> 35:20.160
Holy crap.

35:20.228 --> 35:21.628
Oh, no.

35:23.731 --> 35:25.031
Cleopatra's gone.

35:31.806 --> 35:33.039
Well...

35:33.443 --> 35:35.511
At least we got a map and a boat.

35:36.845 --> 35:38.412
Could be worse.

36:00.350 --> 36:02.019
You know, for a priest,

36:02.025 --> 36:03.959
this Father Chuck sure does live large.

36:03.965 --> 36:05.933
Yeah, this used to be
a cardinal's palace.

36:06.001 --> 36:08.288
They subdivided it into apartments

36:08.294 --> 36:09.896
for priests who work in Rome.

36:09.902 --> 36:12.247
Huh, who would've thought
the clergy was where it was at?

36:12.253 --> 36:14.061
Maybe you should try your hand at it.

36:14.067 --> 36:15.381
Couldn't really get any worse.

36:15.387 --> 36:18.379
Look, I'm sorry for the mess with Vega.

36:18.385 --> 36:20.038
You think you know a guy.

36:20.044 --> 36:22.168
Everyone always lets
you down in the end.

36:25.159 --> 36:26.812
Except you two.

36:27.795 --> 36:30.526
You just might be
the only real friends I got.

36:31.794 --> 36:33.896
I'm gonna make things right, you'll see.

36:33.963 --> 36:36.198
I'll help you find Antony and Cleopatra.

36:36.204 --> 36:37.504
And I'll even throw in

36:37.510 --> 36:39.677
a 50% off friends and family discount.

36:39.683 --> 36:41.502
Of course.

36:42.263 --> 36:44.698
I'll let you two work out those details.

36:44.704 --> 36:45.937
I've got to call Soledad,

36:45.943 --> 36:47.974
let her know what we
found about her father.

36:47.980 --> 36:49.101
Yeah.

36:53.883 --> 36:55.751
Lexi, thanks for calling.

36:55.818 --> 36:58.086
I heard from the police about my father.

36:58.092 --> 36:59.759
He never abandoned you.

37:00.184 --> 37:02.152
He just couldn't get
through the minefield

37:02.158 --> 37:03.668
around the island. Eventually...

37:04.803 --> 37:06.704
Well, eventually, he just gave up.

37:06.857 --> 37:09.092
I thought that recording
you played for me

37:09.098 --> 37:12.034
would be the last
thing I hear about him.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.541
Thank you.

37:13.547 --> 37:15.904
I will make sure that he is brought back

37:15.910 --> 37:18.211
to be reunited with his family.

37:18.341 --> 37:20.075
Muchas gracias.

37:28.653 --> 37:29.920
How'd it go?

37:29.988 --> 37:31.288
Oh, she, uh...

37:31.294 --> 37:33.161
Appreciated the closure.

37:33.456 --> 37:36.358
She also got me thinking
about something.

37:36.426 --> 37:37.960
Recordings.

37:38.027 --> 37:40.762
- What the DEA had on Sanchez?
- No.

37:40.830 --> 37:43.598
What Simon Hardwick
has on the Brotherhood.

37:54.644 --> 37:56.578
Oh, yes.

38:01.384 --> 38:02.784
Hi.

38:04.244 --> 38:06.716
Shall I just assume you're
always gonna bring a group

38:06.722 --> 38:08.552
that gets larger every time?

38:08.558 --> 38:09.725
Aiden Shaw.

38:09.792 --> 38:11.278
I know who you are.

38:11.284 --> 38:12.823
Please, uh...

38:12.829 --> 38:14.463
Make yourselves at home, why don't you?

38:16.666 --> 38:19.501
Uh... well, I don't suppose

38:19.507 --> 38:21.365
I could offer anybody a drink, could I?

38:21.371 --> 38:22.904
Are you okay?

38:22.972 --> 38:24.172
I killed a man.

38:24.240 --> 38:26.174
- But otherwise, fine.
- Look, I know

38:26.180 --> 38:29.193
it's tough, Simon, but
you didn't have a choice.

38:29.261 --> 38:30.741
Farouk would have killed you.

38:30.747 --> 38:31.947
It'll get easier.

38:32.015 --> 38:33.582
You know, on second thought,

38:33.588 --> 38:35.456
I will take you up on that drink.

38:36.867 --> 38:38.643
Well, you're obviously
not here to inquire

38:38.649 --> 38:39.950
on my welfare, are you?

38:39.956 --> 38:42.190
We actually came for some information.

38:42.258 --> 38:44.659
The night we got Farouk,
you said you had a bug

38:44.665 --> 38:46.266
inside the Serapis crypt.

38:46.458 --> 38:48.025
Any chance you've heard them talk

38:48.031 --> 38:49.765
about Cleopatra's location

38:49.771 --> 38:52.211
- in the last couple days?
- I-I don't th-think...

38:52.217 --> 38:54.391
When would I have had the t...?

38:56.241 --> 38:57.808
Why? What is it?

38:57.814 --> 38:59.941
Oh, we found Cleopatra.

39:00.009 --> 39:01.643
Well, that's great, right?

39:01.711 --> 39:03.645
And then she was stolen from us.

39:03.651 --> 39:05.083
Not so great.

39:05.089 --> 39:06.794
I think the Brotherhood is behind it.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.245
It could have been Farouk's crew.

39:08.251 --> 39:10.042
I'm just saying, we
shouldn't assume anything.

39:10.048 --> 39:12.605
Right. But then why are
you so sure it's Serapis?

39:12.611 --> 39:14.228
If you have the recordings, we might

39:14.234 --> 39:16.029
be able to tell, one way or the other.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.659
I thought I was done with all of this.

39:20.096 --> 39:21.797
Look, I suppo... If I can help

39:21.803 --> 39:23.554
in any way, then, then, then I will.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.595
You know, it'll take me a day or so.

39:25.601 --> 39:27.669
I'll, uh, I'll have to go through

39:27.675 --> 39:29.428
the recording... I'm
not promising anything.

39:29.434 --> 39:31.268
The recordings might
be fruitless, right?

39:31.274 --> 39:34.009
Just get us something
as soon as you can.

39:34.015 --> 39:35.871
What happened?

39:36.133 --> 39:38.241
I don't get it. It's right here.

39:38.247 --> 39:40.148
Yes, and it's empty.

39:40.154 --> 39:41.488
No way.

39:41.494 --> 39:43.486
All the surveillance footage was blank.

39:43.492 --> 39:44.948
They must've had a man on the inside,

39:44.954 --> 39:46.618
turned off all the cameras.

39:46.624 --> 39:48.741
Theft wasn't even discovered
till the morning shift.

39:48.747 --> 39:50.358
News hasn't been alerted yet.

39:50.364 --> 39:52.899
This building is surrounded
by soldiers. I...

39:52.905 --> 39:54.209
How could they get enough people

39:54.215 --> 39:55.568
in here without anybody noticing?

39:55.574 --> 39:57.875
Good question. One among many.

39:57.881 --> 39:59.734
How many of the guards were knocked out?

39:59.802 --> 40:01.336
Just the four in this room.

40:01.404 --> 40:02.737
None of them saw anything.

40:02.805 --> 40:04.506
If they did have an inside man,

40:04.512 --> 40:06.915
they could have had more
people hidden in the room

40:06.921 --> 40:08.877
waiting for the place to close.

40:08.883 --> 40:10.594
But then they would still have needed

40:10.600 --> 40:12.567
to get past a hundred soldiers.

40:14.517 --> 40:17.085
What's on the other side of this wall?

40:24.699 --> 40:26.634
Blimey.

40:27.813 --> 40:30.961
- They didn't go out; they went down.
- Great.

40:30.967 --> 40:32.367
Of course.

40:32.435 --> 40:34.035
Get on the phones.

40:34.103 --> 40:36.071
Now Farouk's crew has
everything they need

40:36.139 --> 40:38.073
- for the attack.
- Unless...

40:38.079 --> 40:40.313
Serapis took Antony and Cleopatra.

40:42.145 --> 40:44.305
Come on, look at the coordination.

40:44.311 --> 40:46.504
Having an inside man at the museum?

40:46.510 --> 40:48.112
Not blowing the place up like

40:48.118 --> 40:49.713
the pyramids to cover their tracks.

40:49.719 --> 40:52.523
That sounds a lot more like Serapis
than Farouk's crew.

40:52.529 --> 40:54.823
Anybody would've been trying
not to draw attention.

40:54.829 --> 40:56.229
They didn't want to go to battle

40:56.235 --> 40:57.687
against his whole bloody army.

40:57.693 --> 40:59.804
Why are you so sure it isn't Serapis?

40:59.810 --> 41:02.392
We find Cleopatra, and
suddenly they're family?

41:02.398 --> 41:03.789
Well, technically they are.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.562
Oh, so you're gonna join
the Brotherhood now?

41:05.568 --> 41:08.606
I didn't say that. Can we
please focus on the issue?

41:08.612 --> 41:09.845
I am.

41:09.851 --> 41:11.919
And I'm not related to
any of the suspects.

41:12.875 --> 41:14.676
I need to talk to the two of you.

41:18.181 --> 41:20.682
Whoever attacked me after
looking into Zara Farouk

41:20.750 --> 41:22.184
is getting desperate.

41:22.251 --> 41:24.498
Do you know anything about... who it is?

41:24.504 --> 41:26.683
No, but I know this belongs to him.

41:26.689 --> 41:28.623
And I know who's been
pulling the strings

41:28.629 --> 41:30.563
behind Farouk's organization.

41:33.523 --> 41:35.433
Reece gives these to...

41:35.439 --> 41:37.139
His family and friends.

41:37.145 --> 41:39.267
And people high up in his organization.

41:41.318 --> 41:42.785
That's him.

41:43.220 --> 41:45.402
I saw him at the silo.

41:45.408 --> 41:47.943
There must be some explanation.

41:48.010 --> 41:50.445
Danny, his sleeves are rolled up,

41:50.513 --> 41:52.614
like he lost a cuff link.

41:52.682 --> 41:54.495
But Yates?

41:54.769 --> 41:58.276
Yates is more the kind to
take orders than give them.

41:58.282 --> 42:00.855
It's hard to picture him
bossing Farouk around.

42:03.142 --> 42:04.717
Maybe...

42:05.674 --> 42:09.286
The real bad guy has been in
front of us all this time.
