00:02.437 --> 00:05.875
Previously, onCharmed...So, now that we'’re in the clear,
can I take you out

00:05.918 --> 00:07.877
on a proper date?

00:09.618 --> 00:12.142
I have a rare
autoimmune disorder.

00:12.186 --> 00:15.232
My family doesn'’t
want anyone to know.I'’m here.

00:15.276 --> 00:16.886
GALVIN: Look, I should
probably explain... MACY: How you

00:16.929 --> 00:18.844
got together with someone else
like a minute after we kissed?

00:18.888 --> 00:20.672
You mean after
you blew me off several times.

00:20.716 --> 00:23.327
MACY:
I think it'’s some kind
of protection mark.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.459
Oh, no. Stay away from him.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.767
MAMA ROZ:
You'’ve got darkness inside you.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.248
What'’s the Scythe
of Tartarus?

00:31.292 --> 00:32.554
You can strike it
on the ground

00:32.597 --> 00:34.034
and set any prisoner
in Tartarus free.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.562
I'’ll take that.

00:40.605 --> 00:42.781
Thanks.

00:42.825 --> 00:44.000
You!

00:46.785 --> 00:48.396
♪

00:51.964 --> 00:53.096
Oh!

00:53.140 --> 00:55.185
MEL:
She'’s getting away
with the Scythe!

00:57.100 --> 00:58.536
Incinti!

01:00.495 --> 01:02.584
JADA: Behind you.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.935
JADA:
Too slow.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.634
Damn, she'’s good.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.114
Mel, we should
get out of here.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.985
That demon probably killed
Mom and the other Elders

01:13.029 --> 01:14.639
and we'’re just
letting her get away?

01:14.683 --> 01:16.554
No, we aren'’t letting her
get away with anything.

01:16.598 --> 01:19.296
We need to regroup.
Mel, we'’ll get her.

01:27.304 --> 01:30.438
Oh Hehkatay, ahstaythi.

01:59.423 --> 02:02.252
HARRY:
If this lodestone is broken,

02:02.296 --> 02:03.775
then so is the Scythe.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.342
Which means it was used.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.779
To release some demon from
the prison of Hell or whatever.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.477
Tartarus.CHARITY: I'’m afraid so.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.566
You did the right thing,
summoning the Elders.

02:11.609 --> 02:15.004
Creatures held in Tartarus
are the worst of the worst.

02:15.047 --> 02:17.659
The type of evil that gives
other demons nightmares.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.139
Which means
this demon we'’re after

02:19.182 --> 02:20.662
was looking for something
even more powerful

02:20.705 --> 02:22.751
and more evil.MAGGIE: So,

02:22.794 --> 02:24.622
should we just retire
to the Apocalypse bunker

02:24.666 --> 02:26.015
Mom hopefully built
under this house?

02:26.058 --> 02:27.190
CHARITY:
There is a window.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.279
The released demon
will be weakened

02:29.323 --> 02:31.673
from years, decades or
millennia of captivity.

02:31.716 --> 02:34.284
It will need time
to recover to full strength.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.286
So let'’s stay
above ground for now.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.114
That reminds me
of the time

02:38.158 --> 02:40.334
the demon Mammon
was pursuing us and...Oh.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.466
remember, we hid in...That fetid crypt.

02:42.510 --> 02:44.816
HARRY: Well, we made
the best of it.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.862
Where were we? Right.
What else do we know

02:46.905 --> 02:48.342
about this demon
with the Scythe?

02:48.385 --> 02:49.473
She teleports.

02:49.517 --> 02:50.779
Teleports?I'’ve checked the book

02:50.822 --> 02:53.173
for electricity demons
with that power, but...

02:53.216 --> 02:54.783
Well, I'’m happy to
lend my knowledge

02:54.826 --> 02:56.611
to help narrow
the search.Okay, so, since we

02:56.654 --> 02:58.526
have some time, should
I head off to work?

02:58.569 --> 03:00.484
I have to stay late
at the lab again.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.921
Again? You'’ve had
to work insane hours

03:02.965 --> 03:05.185
since your promotion.Yes.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.490
I am a supervisor now.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.318
Yeah, and I'’m supposed
to be checking out

03:08.362 --> 03:09.754
this summer job
recruitment thing.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.626
You know, in case we
do prevent the Apocalypse

03:11.669 --> 03:13.236
and there is
a summer next year.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.543
Carry on. Harry and I will hold
things down here with Mel.

03:15.586 --> 03:16.544
Thanks.

been on terrible dates.

I don'’t know about you, ladies,
but I consider myself a queen.

03:33.343 --> 03:37.129
One who doesn'’t have time to
wade through garbagedudes.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.132
a matchmaker

combining psychology and
a cutting-edge data analysis,

03:42.874 --> 03:46.138
coded by Lainey here,
for maximum compatibility.

03:46.182 --> 03:48.750
The on-campus recruiter who
registers the most new users

03:48.793 --> 03:50.447
by the end of winter break

03:50.491 --> 03:52.232
will join us in
Chicago this summer

03:52.275 --> 03:54.799
for a fabulous and
fun internship.

Hey.Hey.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.247
What are you doing here?

04:07.290 --> 04:09.031
Well, I couldn'’t
let you walk home

04:09.074 --> 04:11.207
in this weather when
my ride has heated seats.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.166
Well, seeing as I'’ve clearly
found my perfect match...

04:14.210 --> 04:17.169
this job is my chance
to pay it forward. Plus,

04:17.213 --> 04:19.259
if I'’m the best recruiter,
I get to go to Chicago

04:19.302 --> 04:20.738
for an internship this summer.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.044
Chicago, huh?

04:22.087 --> 04:24.046
Meaning I'’d finally
get to see someplace

04:24.089 --> 04:25.395
other than Hilltowne.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.832
Or you could come work

04:27.876 --> 04:30.574
for my dad'’s company with me
in Chicago this summer.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.750
It pays above
industry standard.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.666
And comes with
built-in make-out breaks.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.716
We can spend
the summer together.

04:41.759 --> 04:44.849
Weekends sailing on Lake Geneva.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.851
That'’s my literal
dream summer.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.201
Plus, I bet you'’re
even hotter with a tan.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.596
But...

04:52.640 --> 04:54.337
this internship

04:54.381 --> 04:56.383
earns me class credit
for my major.

04:56.426 --> 04:59.081
Besides, I want to get
to Chicago on my own.

04:59.124 --> 05:02.954
And if I do get it, that still
puts us in the same city.

05:02.998 --> 05:05.435
So, that lake offer...?

05:05.479 --> 05:08.046
Is always open.
Of course.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.658
You'’re gonna make
a top

05:20.755 --> 05:23.192
ALISTAIR:
This should have been easy.

05:23.235 --> 05:25.803
You dangle the offer
of the paid internship with us,

05:25.847 --> 05:28.719
she takes a mandatory drug
test, we get her plasma!

05:28.763 --> 05:31.548
She'’s a townie who
has never even been on a plane,

05:31.592 --> 05:34.464
and yet you can'’t convince her
to work for us.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.858
She wants to get her own job,
not work for you.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.382
Is his boyish charm supposed
to work like mind control?

05:39.426 --> 05:41.166
You stay out of this, Hunter.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.998
You'’re getting worse,
aren'’t you?

05:50.262 --> 05:53.788
Well, I think I know
what might help that.

05:55.529 --> 05:58.880
Doing what I damn well
tell you to do!

05:58.923 --> 06:02.840
That weak human half of you

06:02.884 --> 06:04.451
is being killed
every passing minute

06:04.494 --> 06:05.843
by your demonic side.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.454
He knows, Dad.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.456
No need to twist the knife.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.980
This serum
we'’re trying to create--

06:12.023 --> 06:15.244
it'’s the only hope you have
of surviving.

06:15.287 --> 06:18.813
The injections, they'’re...

06:18.856 --> 06:21.990
they'’re a clumsy Band-Aid,
at best.

06:24.427 --> 06:27.778
And I don'’t give a damn
if you'’re not a mesmerist!

06:27.822 --> 06:31.173
Manipulate the witch'’s
mind-reading abilities

06:31.216 --> 06:34.437
and get the job done.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.483
I'’ll take care of it.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.228
Wait, I-I can'’t do this
right now.

06:43.272 --> 06:44.316
I'’ll call you later.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.538
Hey...

06:48.582 --> 06:50.192
you okay?

06:50.235 --> 06:52.455
Walking on air.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.462
Why don'’t you head out?

06:59.506 --> 07:01.290
I can finish up here.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.728
Thanks.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.688
Sure.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.220
Dr. Vaughn.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.918
You'’re still here.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.312
Just, uh, finishing up
a couple extractions.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.532
Macy, you don'’t have to keep
auditioning-- you have the job.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.534
:
Oh, no, I... I promise,

07:27.577 --> 07:29.710
I'’m truly enjoying myself.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.102
I know you are.

07:31.146 --> 07:33.235
And work can be
a great escape, believe me.

07:33.278 --> 07:34.715
But it'’s important that you fill

07:34.758 --> 07:36.543
other cups in your life.

07:36.586 --> 07:39.589
Hang out with your friends.
Go out on a date.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.286
You'’ve got
all the time in the world

07:41.330 --> 07:42.418
to become a workaholic like me.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.248
Yeah, you got it.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.642
So you'’re heading out?

07:48.685 --> 07:49.904
Yeah.

07:49.947 --> 07:52.428
I'’ll just... clean up here.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.343
Good night.

08:04.135 --> 08:05.833
MAN:
Tonight was perfect.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.748
Yeah, big shout-out
to AptitudeMatch.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.619
Would it be cheesy
of me to say that

08:09.663 --> 08:11.403
this is too good
to be true?

08:11.447 --> 08:13.884
Cheesy, yes, but also accurate.

08:13.928 --> 08:16.017
I'’ll call you later.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.608
What about an Ekrixeis?Not powerful enough
to kill Marisol.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.610
That'’s static electricity
more so than bursts.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.829
A Shokravus demon?Impossible.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.483
We destroyed
that entire species in '’07.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.441
Oh, yes.
How could I forget?

08:51.879 --> 08:54.577
Oh, my God.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.623
A man went missing
in Ferrer Township.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.886
That'’s where we lost the demon
who stole the Scythe.

08:58.929 --> 09:00.191
The police found

09:00.235 --> 09:02.324
his car but no body.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.935
Could this have anything to do
with what the demon released?

09:04.979 --> 09:06.415
Let'’s go find out.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.033
Now, we need to determine
if the perpetrator

09:16.077 --> 09:18.862
was mortal or monster.
This could just be a regular

09:18.906 --> 09:22.039
human crime, in which case
it does not concern us.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.475
It'’s a missing person--

09:23.519 --> 09:26.348
either way,
wouldn'’t we try to help?

09:26.391 --> 09:28.611
Wait. We wouldn'’t?Mel, you know we
don'’t intervene

09:28.655 --> 09:29.830
in human-on-human
affairs.

09:29.873 --> 09:32.702
Those are to be
left to the police.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.965
If we took the time
to sort out every human crime

09:35.009 --> 09:37.968
among a global population
of seven billion,

09:38.012 --> 09:40.405
what room would that leave us
to do our actual jobs?

09:40.449 --> 09:41.711
Which is to save

09:41.755 --> 09:44.627
the world from
supernatural peril.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.368
Charity, here.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.205
Hmm. Oh...

09:57.248 --> 09:59.468
Now, that'’s demonic.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.822
Let'’s get out of here.

10:22.317 --> 10:25.189
Of course Dr. Wagner
can say don'’t burn out.

10:25.233 --> 10:28.453
She'’s already
hugely successful.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.281
Extra hours at the lab

10:30.325 --> 10:34.721
are precisely what I need
to become a Dr. Wagner.

10:34.764 --> 10:37.419
I'’m with Dr. Boss Lady
on this one.

10:37.462 --> 10:38.899
You need to slow down.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.291
Shake out that gorgeous hair
of yours and live a little.

10:40.335 --> 10:42.032
Oh, we talked about that.Sorry.

10:42.076 --> 10:44.600
But I'’m serious.
For starters...

10:44.644 --> 10:46.080
download Aptitude.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.604
If I get the most people
to sign up for the app,

10:48.648 --> 10:50.475
I get to go to Chicago
for the summer.

10:50.519 --> 10:52.216
Chicago?

10:52.260 --> 10:53.740
Oh, I-I just thought we'’d all

10:53.783 --> 10:55.916
hang out together this summer.

10:55.959 --> 10:58.483
It'’s your first time out
of school since I moved here.

10:58.527 --> 10:59.963
Well, I'’ll come back
on weekends,

11:00.007 --> 11:02.270
and we can hang out then.
It'’s just,

11:02.313 --> 11:04.141
you'’ve gotten to live
in these exciting places

11:04.185 --> 11:07.362
like New York City,
and I never have.

11:07.405 --> 11:09.581
What about the
Power of Three?

11:09.625 --> 11:12.236
Kind of hard to enact
when you'’re in another state.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.369
Well, it'’s only
a two-hour drive.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.327
And if it'’s more time-pressing,
then Harry can just...

11:16.371 --> 11:17.981
"poof" me or whatever.

11:18.025 --> 11:20.505
We can'’t keep doing that to him.
Teleporting people

11:20.549 --> 11:22.246
massively depletes
his magical energy.

11:22.290 --> 11:25.815
I'’ll find a way.
So will you please register?

11:25.859 --> 11:27.730
You know, studies have
unanimously found

11:27.774 --> 11:30.341
black women and Asian men are
not only the least swiped on,

11:30.385 --> 11:31.691
they'’re the least matched.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.518
Okay, well, first of all,
I find it...

11:33.562 --> 11:35.695
absolutely impossible
to believe that someone

11:35.738 --> 11:37.522
as gorgeous as you are
wouldn'’t get any matches.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.350
In which case I'’d likely
be fetishized

11:39.394 --> 11:40.743
by those matches.

11:40.787 --> 11:43.224
And the last thing I want
is some guy I just met

11:43.267 --> 11:46.531
telling me how exotic I am
and how cute our babies will be.

11:46.575 --> 11:50.187
Will you please
just sign up for it?

11:50.231 --> 11:52.537
You don'’t even
have to swipe.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.887
I'’ll take your
dish duty all week.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.717
Deal.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.772
You'’re kind of a one-trick pony,
but nice reflexes.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.556
Oh, it makes jokes.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.820
Who are you? And what the hell
did you release from Tartarus?

12:13.863 --> 12:16.170
I'’m Jada, and I've
been watching you.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.867
From what I'’ve seen,
you got potential.

12:17.911 --> 12:18.999
Then why are you trying
to kill me?

12:19.042 --> 12:20.478
I'’m not here to kill you, Mel.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.741
I'’m trying to recruit you.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.265
For what?The Sarcana.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.528
We'’re a rogue group of witches

12:26.571 --> 12:27.659
who don'’t follow
the Elders'’

12:27.703 --> 12:30.532
arbitrary rules or general B.S.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.447
You'’re a witch?

12:32.490 --> 12:34.318
I don'’t believe you.

12:34.362 --> 12:35.624
Well, if we'’re gonna
get technical with it,

12:35.667 --> 12:37.844
I'’m half witch...

12:37.887 --> 12:41.412
half Whitelighter.And that'’s why you can teleport.

12:41.456 --> 12:44.328
And according
to your precious Elders,

12:44.372 --> 12:46.200
because I'’m the child
of a forbidden

12:46.243 --> 12:49.812
Whitelighter-witch relationship,
I'’m a--

12:49.856 --> 12:51.640
what they call it--

12:51.683 --> 12:53.120
An abomination.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.122
And that'’s why
you killed my mother?

12:55.165 --> 12:56.688
Because she was an Elder?

12:56.732 --> 12:58.342
Please.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.431
Marisol was an ally
of the Sarcana.

13:00.475 --> 13:03.173
You'’re a Charmed One.
You could be doing so much more,

13:03.217 --> 13:07.090
not letting the Elders
and their rules hold you back.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.266
The Sarcana help all
of humankind,

13:09.310 --> 13:11.921
not just people
in supernatural danger.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.794
Magic can change the world.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.621
Why should we limit ourselves?

13:16.665 --> 13:18.754
How do I know
any of this is true?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.843
Your Book of Shadows.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.453
The Desenmascarar spell.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.064
Should be page 672.

13:24.107 --> 13:26.066
I helped Marisol write it.

13:26.109 --> 13:28.155
Pretty dope spell,
if I say so myself.

13:28.198 --> 13:30.200
Here.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.813
A shard of the Scythe.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.815
All yours.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.817
Was Marisol'’s anyway.

13:37.860 --> 13:41.472
Just needed to borrow it
for a little bit.What did you release?

13:41.516 --> 13:45.259
One of the greatest witches
in recent history

13:45.302 --> 13:48.088
from the prison
your Elders placed her in.

13:48.131 --> 13:50.655
That'’s right.
Charmed or not,

13:50.699 --> 13:52.309
break the wrong rule,

13:52.353 --> 13:55.095
don'’t think
they won'’t turn on you, too.

14:07.411 --> 14:10.632
Her name is Jada, and she'’s not
a demon. She'’s a witch.

14:10.675 --> 14:13.853
And she called herself
a Sarcana or something.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.637
No, that-that'’s not possible.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.813
So she was telling the truth--

14:17.857 --> 14:19.336
the Sarcana are a thing?

14:19.380 --> 14:23.253
The Sisters of Arcana
are terrorists, Mel.

14:23.297 --> 14:26.778
They practice unsanctioned magic

14:26.822 --> 14:29.390
in pursuit of vigilante justice.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.045
They mounted an
insurrection decades ago,

14:32.088 --> 14:34.177
resulting in many deaths, but...

14:34.221 --> 14:35.962
they were all defeated.

14:36.005 --> 14:38.181
Jada...

14:38.225 --> 14:40.880
she gave me a shard
of the Scythe of Tartarus.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.272
So she did use it.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.708
Apparently,
to release

14:43.752 --> 14:45.580
a witch from Hell'’s prison.

14:45.623 --> 14:48.061
A witch put there
by the Elders?No.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.759
Thi-This Jada
is manipulating you.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.761
But some
of what she told me was true,

14:52.804 --> 14:56.069
like the Desenmascarar spell.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.071
I checked The Book of Shadows,

14:58.114 --> 15:00.856
and it was exactly
where she said it would be,

15:00.900 --> 15:02.902
down to the page number.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.034
How?

15:05.078 --> 15:07.732
Because...

15:07.776 --> 15:09.734
the Sarcana were started

15:09.778 --> 15:11.867
by an Elder.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.739
An Elder who chafed

15:14.783 --> 15:16.393
against the established rules
of witchcraft

15:16.437 --> 15:19.179
and took matters
into her own hands.

15:19.222 --> 15:21.746
Wait, what did you do
with the shard? The Elders...

15:21.790 --> 15:24.140
I destroyed it.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.229
No one should have
that much power.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.536
If the Sarcana
have truly reassembled,

15:28.579 --> 15:31.147
they will be looking
to add power to their ranks.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.670
Who better than a Charmed One?

15:34.281 --> 15:36.500
You have no idea

15:36.544 --> 15:39.939
what these witches
are capable of.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.825
You all right?

16:04.311 --> 16:06.269
Mel told me.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.492
Oh, it all just...

16:13.929 --> 16:16.279
...brings everything back.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.325
I know.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.414
I feel it, too.

16:23.330 --> 16:26.289
I think about her all the time.

16:39.607 --> 16:42.001
No. No, no.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.090
We-we can'’t go there again.

16:49.269 --> 16:52.141
I'’ll need to discuss this
with the Elders in person.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.143
It'’s, um...

16:54.187 --> 16:56.841
it'’s far too big a deal
for a group text.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.889
Good night, Harry.

17:17.688 --> 17:21.431
Hey. Just checking in
on those lab report revisions.

17:21.475 --> 17:23.433
I already e-mailed it to you.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.000
Maybe check your inbox

17:25.044 --> 17:26.741
before you start
asking people for things.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.396
Look, I don'’t know what's

17:29.439 --> 17:31.006
going on with you.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.008
Let me be clear.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.618
There'’s no version
of this relationship

17:34.662 --> 17:37.752
where you ever
get to talk to me like that.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.797
Look, Macy...

17:42.452 --> 17:45.020
Full disclosure: I was
short with you the other day

17:45.064 --> 17:48.067
because Summer and I broke up,

17:48.110 --> 17:50.112
maybe 30 seconds before
you approached me.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.896
Oh.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.550
Add to that,
about an hour ago,

17:53.594 --> 17:56.988
Dr. Wagner just completely
cut my genetics research

17:57.032 --> 17:58.555
of the last three years

17:58.599 --> 18:00.905
due to "more pressing
budget concerns," and

18:00.949 --> 18:04.126
I guess I'’m just
not taking it well.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.129
But n-none of that
is-is an excuse for me

18:07.173 --> 18:09.566
disrespecting you.
I'’m....

18:09.610 --> 18:11.525
I'’m really sorry.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.268
I-I had no idea
about the funding.

18:15.311 --> 18:17.444
She didn'’t tell me.Yeah.

18:17.487 --> 18:20.795
It'’s one of those
moments where...

18:20.838 --> 18:24.364
hard work just doesn'’t
seem worth it, you know?

18:24.407 --> 18:26.105
I'’m really sorry.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.716
Yeah.

18:28.759 --> 18:32.589
Well, look, you don'’t need
to hear my whole sob story.

18:32.633 --> 18:36.202
And... and I don'’t think
I'’ve mentioned this

18:36.245 --> 18:38.726
since you got your
promotion, but you...

18:38.769 --> 18:40.989
you'’re doing a fantastic job.

18:42.817 --> 18:45.559
I really appreciate that.

18:46.995 --> 18:49.171
And it'’s not a sob story.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.913
Your passion is
the best thing about you.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.746
MAGGIE:
Galvin is single?

18:58.789 --> 19:00.748
Macy, climb that
like a tree!

19:00.791 --> 19:02.619
Maggie, that ship had sailed.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.230
Besides, there'’s that
little protection mark

19:04.273 --> 19:06.623
getting in our way--
the one his grandma put on him.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.191
I'’ve resigned myself
to marrying my work.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.541
Hmm. Fine.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.848
So what does your husband,
Science, say about

19:13.891 --> 19:15.371
the residue found
at the crime scene?

19:15.415 --> 19:16.938
It'’s an epidermal layer.

19:16.981 --> 19:19.375
I'’ll need a higher magnification
just to be sure.

19:19.419 --> 19:21.464
Hey.

19:21.508 --> 19:24.119
Sorry, but you and Science need
to explore an open relationship.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.599
I mean, have you even
checked Aptitude?

19:25.642 --> 19:27.209
There are plenty
of non-Galvins on here.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.645
I signed up to that thing

19:28.689 --> 19:30.299
as a favor to you.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.040
But you have a match.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.085
He is trescute,
and he messaged you.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.958
"How about you and me be
the control group,

19:37.001 --> 19:39.830
and we let wine be our variable
one night this week?"

19:39.874 --> 19:41.963
Wow. It'’s almost clever.

19:42.006 --> 19:44.052
So are you gonna
message him back or what?

19:44.095 --> 19:46.141
Probably not.Oh.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.926
Fine. You know what?
Use the app or don'’t.

19:48.970 --> 19:52.669
And maybe the mark means
Galvin is a no-go, but...

19:52.713 --> 19:53.975
that doesn'’t change the fact
that you don'’t

19:54.018 --> 19:56.107
put yourself out there
with anyone.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.762
Macy, you'’re amazing.

19:58.806 --> 20:00.764
And you have to start letting
other people see that, too.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.334
Okay, I have a date with Parker.

20:05.378 --> 20:06.944
Text me if you need me.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.990
Okay.Okay. Have fun.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.340
Hey.So what do you
think it is?

20:11.384 --> 20:13.995
It'’s a calcium carbonate
exoskeleton.

20:14.038 --> 20:16.606
We'’re looking for a bug demon.

20:20.044 --> 20:22.786
Mmm. Delicious.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.354
How is everything?

20:25.398 --> 20:26.964
It'’s perfect.
Thanks so much.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.357
Thank you.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.445
Mmm.

20:30.707 --> 20:31.969
How cute are they?

20:33.232 --> 20:36.060
Yeah, we'’re, like...
30% cuter.

20:36.104 --> 20:37.366
'’Cause of my, uh,
amazing bravery

20:37.410 --> 20:38.759
in the face of spicy food?

20:38.802 --> 20:40.674
Are you
actually sweating right now?

20:40.717 --> 20:43.546
Wasabi'’s maybe a three
on the heat scale.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.592
Speak for yourself.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.162
Hey, are you okay?

20:51.206 --> 20:52.990
You know, we can always take
this to go or rain check.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.731
I'’m fine. I'm just...

20:54.775 --> 20:56.255
Excuse me.

21:06.221 --> 21:07.831
WAITRESS:
Oh, Parker.

21:07.875 --> 21:08.832
Can I help you?

21:08.876 --> 21:11.270
You'’re so sexy

21:11.313 --> 21:14.273
with your diseased,
wracking cough.

21:14.316 --> 21:15.665
What are you doing here, Hunter?

21:15.709 --> 21:17.232
Boop.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.888
Making sure you
stay on task.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.498
What'’s happening
out there?

21:22.542 --> 21:24.195
If I didn'’t know any better,
I'’d think you were actually

21:24.239 --> 21:25.196
falling for the witch.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.415
Please.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.417
Never.You sure?

21:28.461 --> 21:30.941
'’Cause, Park, that's not us.

21:30.985 --> 21:33.596
Feelings are for people.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.859
No offense. I know
you'’re half human.

21:35.903 --> 21:38.775
But we both know that you'’re
full demon at your core.

21:38.819 --> 21:39.907
Yeah, tell that to Dad.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.125
Screw Dad.

21:41.169 --> 21:44.303
He'’s a 3,000-year-old douche.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.957
You know I always got your back.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.743
Just keep it together.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.701
Finish the job.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.971
You feeling
any better?

22:01.015 --> 22:02.799
Yeah, I'’m fine.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.671
At least for tonight.

22:06.586 --> 22:08.849
Parker, you know if
there'’s anything wrong,

22:08.892 --> 22:10.851
you can tell me.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.855
Honestly,

22:14.898 --> 22:18.032
I just found out
I need a plasma transfusion.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.342
I know we'’ve only been dating
for, like, five minutes,

22:23.385 --> 22:24.821
and, normally,
I would never ask you

22:24.865 --> 22:26.170
to do something this big, but...

22:26.214 --> 22:28.825
you'’re the only person

22:28.869 --> 22:31.001
outside my family who knows.

22:31.045 --> 22:32.916
And I'’ve already asked
all of them to get tested

22:32.960 --> 22:34.004
to see if they'’re a match.

22:34.048 --> 22:35.832
Say no more.

22:35.876 --> 22:38.400
I'’ll get tested
first thing tomorrow.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.576
Really?

22:40.620 --> 22:42.099
Yeah.

22:42.143 --> 22:44.188
It'’s... a lot.

22:44.232 --> 22:46.016
They have to draw
your blood,

22:46.060 --> 22:49.019
which requires
needles.

22:49.063 --> 22:51.282
You once told me
you passed out

22:51.326 --> 22:53.459
at the sight
of a particularly sharp pencil.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.723
I will get over it.

22:56.766 --> 22:59.029
This is too important.

22:59.073 --> 23:01.641
You have no idea
how much this means to me.

23:05.296 --> 23:08.648
I know we just met, but I think
Aptitude actually found me

23:08.691 --> 23:10.563
my perfect match.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.913
Me, too.

23:33.281 --> 23:35.457
First, bees,
then these nasty buggers.

23:35.501 --> 23:38.112
Just reading about them
makes my skin crawl.

23:40.201 --> 23:42.072
Oh, don'’t tell me you're
still considering what that

23:42.116 --> 23:43.465
so-called witch said.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.162
Charity cautioned you.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.990
I know.

23:47.034 --> 23:49.384
But if I'’m ever gonna find
Mom'’s killer...Mel,

23:49.428 --> 23:51.952
you have no idea
what they are capable of.

23:54.302 --> 23:57.871
You remember... Fiona?

23:57.914 --> 23:58.872
The charge I lost.

23:58.915 --> 24:00.090
The one who died.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.310
Because she came out as a witch.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.705
That'’s not
the full story.

24:07.968 --> 24:10.492
Fiona was
Charity'’s younger sister.

24:12.276 --> 24:14.061
It was the Sarcana
who encouraged Fiona

24:14.104 --> 24:15.454
to flaunt her powers,

24:15.497 --> 24:17.543
then refused to use theirs
to save her

24:17.586 --> 24:18.761
when things
went south.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.589
Fiona was
just left out to dry

24:20.633 --> 24:22.156
when she was declared
criminally insane

24:22.199 --> 24:24.071
and committed
to a mental institution.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.510
And then she killed herself.

24:36.344 --> 24:40.304
Is that why you and
Charity broke up?

24:40.348 --> 24:44.657
Harry, we all know
you two were a thing.

24:46.789 --> 24:50.053
We let our feelings distract us.

24:51.359 --> 24:54.667
And we couldn'’t get
past that guilt.

24:55.885 --> 24:59.846
That said,
the Sarcana are dangerous.

24:59.889 --> 25:03.023
They spread false hope
and cause untold suffering.

25:03.066 --> 25:05.329
And they will do anything
to recruit you.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.418
You guys, I need to get past
my fear of needles stat.

25:07.462 --> 25:08.855
Is there a spell in...

25:08.898 --> 25:10.552
Did I interrupt something?

25:10.596 --> 25:14.077
No. It'’s fine.

25:18.386 --> 25:19.343
Wait.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.869
Look at this.

25:22.912 --> 25:25.567
Could our demon be
an endothermal?

25:25.611 --> 25:27.961
A cicada demon.

25:28.004 --> 25:29.310
Of course.

25:29.353 --> 25:31.747
Cicadas shed exoskeletons.

25:31.791 --> 25:33.053
Hey, where'’s Macy?

25:33.096 --> 25:34.576
Oh, she'’s getting
her date on.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.578
Shut the front door.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.537
She said yes to that date?

25:38.580 --> 25:40.800
How did you know
I was allergic to shellfish?

25:40.843 --> 25:42.671
Oh, you wrote it
in your profile.

25:42.715 --> 25:46.240
Along with your love of
small dogs and prime numbers.

25:46.283 --> 25:49.722
I didn'’t think people paid
attention on these dating apps.

25:49.765 --> 25:52.725
I didn'’t know
what to expect, really.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.596
What, did you think I'’d be
some three

25:54.640 --> 25:57.207
No, I hear what
you'’re saying, though.

25:57.251 --> 26:00.210
You know, how accurate can
these algorithms really be?

26:00.254 --> 26:02.822
Especially when
you'’re considered...

26:02.865 --> 26:05.085
less desirable,
statistically.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.173
You know?

26:06.216 --> 26:07.566
What even is that?

26:07.609 --> 26:09.568
Oh, I know.

26:11.221 --> 26:13.006
Uh, well...

26:13.049 --> 26:16.139
here'’s to... taking a chance.

26:17.445 --> 26:19.534
♪ It'’s just geometry. ♪

26:19.578 --> 26:24.017
These endothermal cicada demons
come out every 17 years to mate.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.235
Oh, good God.

26:25.279 --> 26:26.802
According
to these university archives,

26:26.846 --> 26:28.238
some students
from Hilltowne

26:28.282 --> 26:30.676
went missing at this time
17 years ago.

26:30.719 --> 26:32.068
No bodies
were ever found.

26:32.112 --> 26:34.157
Maybe because those bodies
went underground.

26:34.201 --> 26:36.203
To gestate the next generation.

26:36.246 --> 26:38.205
Wait, are you saying...

26:38.248 --> 26:41.425
These cicada demons
are mating with humans.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.079
Ew!Gross.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.733
It'’s possible.

26:44.777 --> 26:46.082
But they would need
to find the perfect match

26:46.126 --> 26:48.084
for their reproductive needs.

26:48.128 --> 26:49.651
Hold up.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.740
You said Sam Arnold was the name
of the guy who went missing?

26:51.784 --> 26:54.743
Yes. That'’s the guy
whose car we found.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.658
Oh, God.

26:56.702 --> 26:59.400
I knew he sounded familiar.

27:00.401 --> 27:04.013
I registered Sam
for Aptitude.

27:04.057 --> 27:07.016
Wait, who else is on this
missing persons report?

27:07.060 --> 27:09.932
This guy Trevor, Blair,

27:09.976 --> 27:12.456
Kelsey.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.588
All of these people are missing,

27:13.632 --> 27:15.155
and they all signed up
for Aptitude.

27:15.198 --> 27:18.637

through that infernal app.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.248

Macy.

27:21.291 --> 27:24.555
You know what, I thought
tonight was gonna be a disaster.

27:24.599 --> 27:27.210
But I actually had
a really nice time.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.212
I did, too.

27:29.256 --> 27:31.388
Thank you for not
being a catfish.

27:31.432 --> 27:34.043
Or racist.

do this again sometime?

27:42.530 --> 27:45.533
Why end things now?

28:27.662 --> 28:30.578
Still no answer.
This is all my fault.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.145
I'’m the one
who convinced her to sign up

28:32.188 --> 28:33.624
for that stupid dating app.

28:33.668 --> 28:35.626
"The endothermal queen
can lay her eggs

28:35.670 --> 28:37.106
in host bodies
at any time."

28:37.150 --> 28:39.239
I wanted to get Macy laid,
but not like this.

28:39.282 --> 28:41.197
HARRY: The hatchlings then feed
on the bodies of their hosts.

28:41.241 --> 28:45.506
If we can just find the birthing
chamber before the eggs hatch,

28:45.549 --> 28:47.943
we can then use this
fumigation spell

28:47.987 --> 28:49.466
and save Macy
and any others.

28:49.510 --> 28:50.946
Destroy the queen,
take down the colony.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.643
HARRY:
Exactly.

28:52.687 --> 28:53.819
The queen.

28:54.863 --> 28:57.474
I think I know where they are.

Ready to find your perfect...?

29:05.439 --> 29:07.615
Thanks, but I'’m still getting
over my ex.

29:07.658 --> 29:08.834
Macy could be anywhere.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.400
Maggie, how well
do you know this building?

29:10.444 --> 29:13.012
Not very well. But let'’s ask
someone who knows.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.754
Oh, my God.
I can hear all of them.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.103
The whole colony--

29:17.146 --> 29:18.408
their thoughts are connected,
like a...

29:18.452 --> 29:19.932
Hive mind.

29:19.975 --> 29:22.238
I think they'’re in the basement.

29:22.282 --> 29:24.937
It'’s on Level P3,
but it'’s a secured area.

29:26.634 --> 29:27.591
Not anymore.

29:27.635 --> 29:28.810
Come on, let'’s hurry.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.769
The queen is ready to...
mate or whatever.

29:34.424 --> 29:35.817
Oh, my God.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.605
HARRY:
As I'’ve mentioned, I don't do

29:41.649 --> 29:43.129
particularly well with insects.

29:44.173 --> 29:45.958
Pull it together, Har.

29:51.702 --> 29:54.444

30:00.015 --> 30:02.670

30:02.713 --> 30:05.238

plenty of demons there,

35:38.701 --> 35:40.616
In my living room?

35:40.660 --> 35:42.270
We can congregate anywhere,

35:42.314 --> 35:44.446
including duplicate dimensions
of our world.

35:44.490 --> 35:46.927
This is your home as it exists
in another dimension.

35:46.970 --> 35:50.409
Sure. That makes
total sense.

35:50.452 --> 35:52.976
What'’s with
their faces?

35:53.020 --> 35:55.849
I do apologize for
the unnerving disguises,

35:55.892 --> 35:59.287
but with whoever'’s hunting us
still at large,

35:59.331 --> 36:02.769
all other Elders'’ identities
must remain protected for now.

36:02.812 --> 36:06.860
What aren'’t you telling me
about the Sarcana?

36:06.903 --> 36:11.386
If they'’re so evil, then why are
they using magic to help people?

36:11.430 --> 36:14.520
We are responsible
for the safety

36:14.563 --> 36:17.523
of a global population.

36:17.566 --> 36:20.961
The Sarcana only think
of themselves.

36:21.004 --> 36:23.224
And they are more than willing
to risk

36:23.268 --> 36:26.140
or harm innocents
in service of their whims.

36:26.184 --> 36:30.188
Innocents... like
your sister Fiona?

36:34.104 --> 36:36.063
Yes, like Fiona.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.764
Mel, we believe the newly formed
Sisters of Arcana

36:41.808 --> 36:43.288
are responsible for the death
of your mother

36:43.331 --> 36:44.898
and the other Elders.

36:44.941 --> 36:46.029
And we have no reason to believe

36:46.073 --> 36:47.596
they plan to stop killing,

36:47.640 --> 36:50.643
especially if they have summoned
something from Tartarus.

36:50.686 --> 36:52.775
Which is why you'’re here.

36:52.819 --> 36:55.038
You want us to fight
the Sarcana?

36:55.082 --> 36:57.040
No.

36:58.694 --> 37:03.133
We want you, Mel...
to join them.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.358
Hey.Hey.

37:10.402 --> 37:11.707
How are you feeling?

37:11.751 --> 37:13.883
A little better.

37:13.927 --> 37:15.885
Brought sugar.
Oh.

37:15.929 --> 37:18.540
Because the Internet says
low blood sugar is common, um,

37:18.584 --> 37:20.629
after a plasma transfusion.

37:20.673 --> 37:23.545
How are you so incredible,
like, all the time?

37:23.589 --> 37:25.721
I'’m just glad I could help.

37:25.765 --> 37:27.680
The needles weren'’t that bad.

37:27.723 --> 37:30.073
Mel came with me to make sure
I didn'’t have a panic attack.

37:30.117 --> 37:33.076
And since she was there,
she banked some plasma

37:33.120 --> 37:36.079
for whoever needs it.Someone'’s really gonna
appreciate that.

37:36.123 --> 37:38.212
Thank her for me.

37:39.779 --> 37:41.259

37:41.302 --> 37:43.913
