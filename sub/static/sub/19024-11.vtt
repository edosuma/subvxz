00:02.240 --> 00:05.516
<i>Since she lost her apartment,</i>
<i>I let Elliot crash on my floor.</i>

00:05.600 --> 00:07.909
How did this happen?

00:08.000 --> 00:12.676
JD, I'm homeless. I have no money and
everything I own is outside in a truck.

00:12.760 --> 00:18.437
My life's a mess. Plus, you were
going through a lot, too.

00:18.520 --> 00:21.990
My peep was on the fritz.
Much better now, thank you for asking.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.594
We were vulnerable
and we made a mistake.

00:24.680 --> 00:28.116
Four times. And a half,
if you count that last thing.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.351
By the way, that third time, wow!
Where did you learn that?

00:34.520 --> 00:37.034
- What are you watching, buddy?
- <i>Animal Planet.</i>

00:37.120 --> 00:40.192
Why does that monkey keep
biting the other one on the ass?

00:40.280 --> 00:43.078
I don't know,
but she seems to love it.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.873
The Congo. But, look, Elliot,
I think... I think you're right.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.952
Last night was great,
but we can't keep doing this.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.952
- Dr Reid.
- Dr Dorian.

00:56.520 --> 01:00.752
<i>Mistake or not, one cool thing about sex</i>
<i>is it always puts you in a good mood.</i>

01:01.920 --> 01:05.674
<i>Hell, I think it even cheers up</i>
<i>the people around you.</i>

01:05.760 --> 01:10.515
Oh, joy. I get to work on Mrs Creeden
with the Wonder Twins.

01:10.600 --> 01:14.798
Dear Lord, what in Thy most holy name
have I done to offend Thee so?

01:14.880 --> 01:17.713
My brother and I would pretend
we were the Wonder Twins.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.588
He would become "form of a dragon"
and I had to be something made of water,

01:21.680 --> 01:23.591
so I'd say "shape of an ice dragon."

01:23.680 --> 01:27.434
He would say I was copying him and
he'd breathe on me and I'd have to melt,

01:27.520 --> 01:29.511
but it was still so awesome.

01:29.600 --> 01:35.869
That's funny, I don't recall asking for
a really, really, really, really,

01:35.960 --> 01:38.235
really boring story.

01:38.320 --> 01:41.198
My God, Barbie,
don't you understand no one cares?

01:41.280 --> 01:43.840
- I care.
- Correction. No one important cares.

01:43.920 --> 01:49.790
Mrs Creeden is in post-op, so let's
start by CAT-scanning her abdomen.

01:49.880 --> 01:54.954
And gosh, all kidding aside, I'd like to
see us work together on this one.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.196
Come on, now.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.631
Hands in.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.513
Please.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.628
Congratulations again.
He is beautiful.

02:08.759 --> 02:11.274
I was wondering about circumcision.

02:11.400 --> 02:16.599
You're a little old, but my roommate
is a surgeon, he owes me a favour...

02:16.680 --> 02:18.910
Talking about their son, Bambi.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.115
Well, now, see,
that we're set up for.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.033
We wanted to know
how you felt about it, Carla.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.109
Me?

02:26.200 --> 02:30.512
<i>Carla loves her patients. But she also</i>
<i>loves how much they love her.</i>

02:30.600 --> 02:32.431
To be honest, I'm not a big fan.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.751
I've always wonder what the kid
would say if it were up to him.

02:35.840 --> 02:39.753
You want to do what, now?
I just got this thing.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.033
There are no medical advantages
to circumcision.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.918
- I told you.
- Not medical, personal.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.389
<i>That's just great.</i>

02:51.160 --> 02:52.957
What a day.

02:54.080 --> 02:58.949
I am as stressed out
and vulnerable as I was last night.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.712
- Me too.
- What to do?

03:00.800 --> 03:05.510
- What to do? What to do?
- I don't feel like doing anything.

03:05.600 --> 03:11.709
Come on, we could rent a movie.
Got a fresh pack of Uno cards.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.918
You know what we could do?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.798
We could have sex again.
I'm throwing it out there.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.678
- Bite me.
- Oh, come on, I'm sorry.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.751
I was kidding. It's a joke.

03:25.200 --> 03:29.876
No, I mean it. Like you did last night.
Come bite me.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.951
<i>Stay calm.</i>

03:50.520 --> 03:53.956
I'm so relaxed.
I totally forgot about being a doctor.

03:54.040 --> 03:55.439
You're a doctor?

03:55.520 --> 03:58.273
The problem is we know
that we don't work as a couple.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.750
- We're a train wreck.
- So we can't keep doing this.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.950
- Hello and whoa.
- JD, it's just sex.

04:08.040 --> 04:13.114
We're adults. I don't think we have to
apologise for enjoying what we're doing.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.636
<i>That's when she said the words</i>
<i>every man is dying to hear.</i>

04:16.720 --> 04:18.471
We could just be sex buddies.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.031
If you want.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.119
My wife won't listen to reason.

04:29.200 --> 04:34.877
Mr Marrick, even if your son isn't
circumcised, he'll still look like you.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.191
Of course, he'll have to put on
a couple of hundred pounds.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.477
I kid. You're a dashing man.
Have you modelled?

04:41.560 --> 04:45.473
- What's all that about?
- I can't tell you.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.791
It's, you know,
doctor-patient confidentiality.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.758
Oh, right. Tell me.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.752
No, no, I'm not kidding. I can't.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.308
Can't. Or won't.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.676
- Can't.
- Won't!

05:05.280 --> 05:09.956
- Are they still going at it?
- No, Kelso calmed them down.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.713
- I think we're OK.
- We're not OK.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.598
What're you talking about?

05:19.840 --> 05:23.310
You were gonna get that CAT scan
on Mrs Creeden's abdomen.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.597
I have been crazy busy
on the phone with bill collectors,

05:26.680 --> 05:29.148
who, by the way,
are obsessed with money.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.879
I spent an hour in my truck
looking for clean bras.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.315
All I've got
is this date-night push-up one.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.392
I don't like working with these
under my chin all day.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.516
I am walking
someplace right now,

05:39.600 --> 05:42.353
and for the life of me
I can't remember where.

05:42.440 --> 05:46.513
- Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
- Thanks. Bathroom!

05:48.080 --> 05:50.799
Does this name-tag say
"Chief of Medicine"?

05:50.880 --> 05:52.472
- Yes, sir.
- Funny.

05:52.560 --> 05:57.270
That couple thought it said "I'm Bob.
Ask me about your baby's Johnson."

05:57.360 --> 06:02.275
Dammit, In my hospital we do not
go out on a limb with our opinions.

06:02.360 --> 06:06.797
So if a patient has questions
in your hospital, you just ignore them?

06:06.880 --> 06:12.796
Look, stay away from definite answers.
Leave yourself some wiggle room.

06:12.880 --> 06:16.555
Say things like "We'll do what we can"
or "We'll get back to you on that"

06:16.640 --> 06:19.837
- Or "Hell, I don't know."
- Couldn't think of a third one?

06:19.920 --> 06:22.718
That was the third one.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.596
Assface.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.956
Hey, chum. What do you say?

06:29.040 --> 06:33.795
I wanted to tell you not to worry about
getting that CAT scan on Mrs Creeden.

06:33.880 --> 06:38.158
I'll just rip her stitches open, jam
my head in and have a look for myself.

06:38.240 --> 06:41.550
When I tell you to do something,
you better get it done!

06:41.640 --> 06:45.952
<i>It sucks being yelled at, especially</i>
<i>when it's someone else's fault.</i>

06:46.040 --> 06:48.110
That was big of you to cover for Elliot.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.430
I had a good mind
to spank her yesterday.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.636
She screw up
with your patients, too?

06:52.720 --> 06:55.188
- No.
- Elliot seems so frazzled.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.714
She keeps making
one mistake after another.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.519
I mean, I wish I could help her out.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.160
I have no idea how that woman
handles the stress.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.717
I feel so much better.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.916
- See ya, bud.
- Later, dude.

07:10.440 --> 07:14.672
Mr Woodbury's son is getting married.
He's asking if he's gonna be able to go.

07:14.760 --> 07:18.116
He's got a nasty case of pneumonia.
Let's see.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.670
His leukocytosis has resolved.
His blood cultures are negative.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.512
Tell him we'll do the best we can.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.750
Can't we just tell him
that he can go?

07:25.840 --> 07:28.638
Where's the wiggle room in that?
There's no wiggle.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.635
Fine, let me just tell him with you
so I can enjoy it too.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.757
- Thank so you much.
- Oh, you're so very welcome.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.956
- It's my pleasure.
- This is great.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.554
<i>OK, just give her a casual nod.</i>

07:41.640 --> 07:44.359
<i>You don't want Turk</i>
<i>to know what's going on.</i>

07:44.440 --> 07:46.749
- You're hitting that.
- How do you do that?

07:46.840 --> 07:49.638
It's a gift. Remember last time
you two got together?

07:49.720 --> 07:51.517
Relax. We're just having fun.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.795
What, are you guys just sex buddies?

07:56.160 --> 07:57.878
Fa-shizzle.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.712
I don't wanna
get Dr Phil on you,

07:59.800 --> 08:03.349
but women have a hard time
separating sex from emotions.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.908
You may think you're
tapping that right now,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.470
but pretty soon she's gonna be
like, "JD, I need you."

08:09.560 --> 08:11.790
If it got that emotional,
I'd break it off.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.235
OK. Oh, by the way,
dude right there

08:14.320 --> 08:17.756
is totally hitting that dude,
he's totally hitting him.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.957
- You are good.
- I know.

08:21.040 --> 08:24.316
I'm so glad
Esteban found someone.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.157
What's up, Laverne?

08:27.240 --> 08:31.199
This Friday my church group's doing
a production of <i>Rent</i> if you wanna go.

08:31.280 --> 08:34.158
"What's up" that doesn't
make me want to shoot myself?

08:34.240 --> 08:36.434
How's Mr Lawrence doing?

08:36.520 --> 08:38.794
That's no longer any of your business.

08:38.880 --> 08:42.030
He's not your patient
as of two o'clock this afternoon.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.837
He asked for a new doctor.

08:43.919 --> 08:47.071
The second to switch off of
my service today. Why?

08:47.160 --> 08:50.516
They were so overwhelmed
by the high quality of your care

08:50.600 --> 08:52.909
they couldn't stand it another second?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.309
I won't let you
make me feel like crap today.

08:55.400 --> 08:59.154
Every doctor has had patients switch off
of them for no reason at all,

08:59.240 --> 09:01.276
and it is just some
dumb coinkydink

09:01.360 --> 09:03.476
it happened to me
twice on the same day.

09:03.560 --> 09:07.792
If you will excuse me, I have to
check on Mrs Finnegan's chest X-rays.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.270
No, you don't.
She switched off too.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.114
<i>Around here things</i>
<i>can turn bad in a heartbeat.</i>

09:15.200 --> 09:17.839
Mr Woodbury
is still requiring a lot of O2.

09:17.920 --> 09:22.436
We have to keep him here over the
weekend. Give him the skinny, will you?

09:25.200 --> 09:28.715
<i>I guess when you work</i>
<i>in a world of uncertainty,</i>

09:28.800 --> 09:31.678
<i>it's great to have something</i>
<i>at home you can count on.</i>

09:33.120 --> 09:35.918
Elliot, what are you doing?

09:36.000 --> 09:40.437
Just sitting in the dark, crying,
so, you know, the usual.

09:43.200 --> 09:48.957
JD, I had such a crappy day. I really
need you right now. Come here.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.077
<i>She "needs"you?</i>
<i>Oh, my God, Turk was right.</i>

09:52.160 --> 09:56.517
<i>Stop kissing her and put an end to this</i>
<i>before she gets hurt.</i>

09:56.600 --> 09:58.431
Is there something wrong?

09:58.520 --> 10:00.875
<i>Ah, she's a tough kid.</i>
<i>You can tell her later.</i>

10:00.960 --> 10:02.871
Nope.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.115
<i>What did you do?</i>
<i>All right, don't panic.</i>

10:12.200 --> 10:16.318
<i>Maybe she didn't enjoy it.</i>
<i>Oh, come on, who're you kidding?</i>

10:16.400 --> 10:19.836
I don't get it. Why are so many
patients switching off on me?

10:19.920 --> 10:22.036
Are my hands that cold?

10:22.120 --> 10:24.759
- You didn't tell anyone I'm Republican?
- No.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.310
This can't be happening.
I'm a doctor.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.790
What use is being a doctor
if nobody lets you treat them?

10:31.880 --> 10:34.758
What is going on with my life?

10:37.600 --> 10:39.431
<i>This is not the time to talk it out.</i>

10:39.520 --> 10:44.389
<i>Get out of the situation</i>
<i>without making her suspicious.</i>

10:44.480 --> 10:45.993
Hello?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.957
Hi, Mom.

10:48.040 --> 10:53.273
Yeah, I miss you too.
I haven't spoken to you in so long.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.590
Hi, Mr Turk.
No, Chris isn't here.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.671
No, no, sir. I didn't say "Mom."

11:00.760 --> 11:04.719
I said, "mon" like,
"Hey, mon, we be jamming."

11:06.320 --> 11:09.915
No, sir, I don't think
all black people are Jamaican.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.150
I love you too, Mommy.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.198
Sir, could you call back later?
Chris will be home.

11:18.440 --> 11:22.228
There's been some break-ins. I had to
change the locks on these lockers.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.959
You should've gotten
your new combination.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.679
Well, I didn't.
Do you know what it is?

11:27.760 --> 11:30.911
- Yeah.
- But you're not gonna tell me.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.310
Can't. Janitor-locker confidentiality.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.551
<i>He made that up.</i>

11:40.840 --> 11:42.671
Are you watching <i>Sesame Street?</i>

11:42.760 --> 11:47.470
When I was a kid, I had
my first sex dream about Mr Hooper.

11:47.560 --> 11:50.199
At least, I think it was a sex dream.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.750
- He was trying to choke me.
- Yeah, that's sweet.

11:53.840 --> 11:57.116
- Are you on a break?
- I have nothing else to do.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.031
None of my patients wanna see me.

11:59.120 --> 12:03.477
That's a good thing. Now you have time
to take care of your life.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.710
Why are you being so weird?

12:05.800 --> 12:09.759
Well, of course, that could be because
he's shaving his dome so much lately

12:09.840 --> 12:14.550
that the hair's starting to grow inward.
It's an affliction known as the "infro."

12:14.640 --> 12:16.676
But if I were to guess
just exactly why

12:16.760 --> 12:20.912
he's been acting weird lately,
I would say it's because...

12:21.000 --> 12:24.879
he's the one who's been steering
your patients away from you.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.360
Discuss.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.398
<i>Carla has to give</i>
<i>Mr Woodbury the bad news.</i>

12:32.480 --> 12:34.675
- How bad could it be?
- Here she is.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.159
<i>I wonder how he'll take it.</i>

12:37.200 --> 12:41.193
Take her! Out the window!
Throw her out the window!

12:43.120 --> 12:44.314
Here goes.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.995
Mr Woodbury's doing
well enough to be discharged.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.594
I don't mind standing up
to Kelso on this one.

12:50.680 --> 12:55.356
Time to take the "GR" off my "gratitude"
and give him some attitude, JD style.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.796
- His office is that way.
- I have to throw up first.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.791
- What the hell, Turk?
- Good, Barbie.

13:02.880 --> 13:06.589
- Now really access the anger.
- How could you do that to me?

13:06.680 --> 13:08.398
Yeah, honestly, how could you?

13:08.480 --> 13:10.755
I wanted to protect you,
give you a break.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.435
The old "I'm trying to help you" gambit.
Barbie, see through that.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.670
Yo kick him right now.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.588
Elliot, I am sorry!

13:22.440 --> 13:25.876
<i>Now's your chance. You're at work.</i>
<i>She won't get emotional.</i>

13:25.960 --> 13:30.590
<i>Walk in and tell her things are getting</i>
<i>too serious. Just butter her up first.</i>

13:30.680 --> 13:34.559
Look at you, Miss "No one wants me
to be their doctor again."

13:34.640 --> 13:37.518
I don't see
Mr Ellis here complaining.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.592
- He's in a coma.
- Elliot, we should talk.

13:40.680 --> 13:43.956
Turk was telling my patients
to switch off of my service.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.837
What?

13:45.960 --> 13:48.110
Yeah, he said
he was trying to protect me.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.714
I'll go talk to him.

13:50.800 --> 13:55.954
That IV looks like it's infiltrating.
The nurse must have screwed up.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.070
I did that.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.958
What's with the mouthful of Chicklets,
sweetheart?

14:03.040 --> 14:04.758
- No special reason.
- Really?

14:04.840 --> 14:07.559
I thought it might be because
Dr Dorian came to see me

14:07.640 --> 14:10.359
with his feathers all up,
and his voice a-crackin',

14:10.440 --> 14:12.829
and told me he was letting
Mr Woodbury go.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.558
- Oh, did he?
- Yup.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.791
His knees were knocking
so loud I almost didn't see you

14:17.880 --> 14:19.836
above him pulling the strings.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.390
- Look, Dr Kelso...
- Maybe Mr Woodbury will be fine.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.278
Maybe he'll be back
in a few days even worse for wear

14:26.360 --> 14:29.238
because you rushed him out.
Who knows?

14:29.320 --> 14:32.915
But darn it all if what I don't
think is the bigger question

14:33.000 --> 14:35.275
is why you even give a hoot.

14:35.360 --> 14:39.797
Well, actually, sir, I have this little
problem with caring for my patients.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.589
Still, if you decide later
that what you really care about

14:43.680 --> 14:45.875
is how much your patients like you,

14:45.960 --> 14:49.555
you can change your mind
about letting Mr Woodbury leave.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.200
Hell, I'll even back you up.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.317
- Apologise.
- Apologise to you?

15:05.400 --> 15:07.516
To Richard.
That was his basketball.

15:07.600 --> 15:13.232
Hello, Richard. Tomorrow at lunch
I'll bring you a new basketball.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.673
And a hoagie.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.357
This is about Elliot?

15:20.440 --> 15:24.319
Don't you wanna hear my side
of the story with your sex buddy?

15:25.680 --> 15:27.716
- No.
- Come on, where's the love?

15:27.800 --> 15:30.951
Where's the loyalty?
Where's the automatically

15:31.080 --> 15:33.594
siding with the person
you care about the most?

15:35.280 --> 15:40.115
Oh, my God. That's what
you're doing, isn't it? Isn't it?

15:43.680 --> 15:46.592
<i>Some realisations</i>
<i>stop you in your tracks.</i>

15:47.960 --> 15:50.713
<i>Others can lead you</i>
<i>in new directions.</i>

15:50.800 --> 15:53.268
Dr Cox. I just wanted
to let you know that Turk

15:53.360 --> 15:56.477
did the right thing by taking
my patients off of my service.

15:56.560 --> 16:00.155
No. What that yellow-bellied
scalpel jock should have done

16:00.240 --> 16:04.677
was go to surgery and schedule himself
for an early-morning add-a-pair-domy.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.115
That way, if it took,
he'd have the stones

16:07.200 --> 16:09.873
to come and talk to you
next time he had a problem.

16:09.960 --> 16:14.238
I can't seem to stop letting my
life out there affect my life in here.

16:14.320 --> 16:18.598
Well, hell, Barbie, look at me.
It's not like I've always been

16:18.680 --> 16:23.196
the well-adjusted Guy Smiley you see
walking down the halls of this dump.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.829
Stuff like that takes time,
but eventually you learn

16:26.920 --> 16:31.675
to keep your personal problems
separate from this place.

16:31.760 --> 16:35.673
- So, what do I do until then?
- Get your damn life in order.

16:38.920 --> 16:45.189
And, Barbie, let's say word got out that
Uncle Cox was doling out the feel-goods,

16:46.880 --> 16:50.509
I'll make you pay.
You have no idea.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.431
Huge.

16:52.520 --> 16:56.832
<i>It's a funny thing when we're</i>
<i>forced to see ourselves in a new light.</i>

16:56.920 --> 16:58.478
Mr Woodbury! Hold on a sec.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.358
<i>Hopefully, you see yourself</i>
<i>in time to make a change.</i>

17:01.440 --> 17:05.637
We're not comfortable discharging you
just yet. I'm really, really sorry.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.790
<i>Hopefully</i>
<i>you'll be respected for it.</i>

17:07.880 --> 17:10.348
You evil little witch.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.590
Let me see that chart, Nurse.

17:16.800 --> 17:20.315
Well, I see no reason we should
keep Mr Woodbury any longer.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.118
Enjoy your son's wedding.
Cherish the moments.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.031
Thank you so much, Dr...?

17:25.119 --> 17:27.429
Kelso. Bob Kelso.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.557
- Bye, Bob!
- Glad I could help.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.429
<i>Sometimes</i>
<i>the new light opens your eyes</i>

17:36.520 --> 17:40.798
<i>to something you've known</i>
<i>in your heart all along.</i>

17:40.880 --> 17:43.917
It just feels like every day
keeps getting worse.

17:45.320 --> 17:49.711
- What's all this?
- I just felt like taking care of you.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.711
This is so nice.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.951
<i>It's nice because</i>
<i>it's the beginning of something.</i>

18:03.520 --> 18:05.556
- I can't do this.
- OK, less tongue.

18:05.640 --> 18:09.918
No, this.
You know, sex buddies.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.154
Dr Cox and I were talking and my life is
just so scattered right now. I just...

18:19.240 --> 18:21.629
I just can't seem to grab
a toehold, you know?

18:21.720 --> 18:24.712
And I know myself,
and if we keep doing this,

18:24.800 --> 18:27.678
I'm won't be able to separate
the sex from my feelings,

18:27.760 --> 18:29.876
and we'll end up
being a couple again.

18:29.960 --> 18:32.952
And neither one of us
wants that, right?

18:35.240 --> 18:37.879
I mean, I know I don't.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.996
Me neither.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.913
So, what do we do?

18:47.720 --> 18:53.113
It's no big deal. You get your stuff out
of my room and you crash on the couch.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.431
Thanks.
