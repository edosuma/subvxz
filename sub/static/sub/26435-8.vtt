00:02.640 --> 00:05.996
[Growling]

00:22.240 --> 00:26.359
It's about 130, 140 of them.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.558
You ever see them do this before?

00:29.640 --> 00:31.233
No.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.550
Never.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.154
Rosita's back trail goes
right through 'em.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.517
We should get the horses, circle around,

00:39.640 --> 00:41.711
then we'll pick it up on foot.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.950
- What about them?
- What about 'em?

00:44.040 --> 00:45.519
They're just milling around.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.150
That's not normal.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.595
No.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.956
No, it ain't.

00:55.040 --> 00:57.395
[Wind rushing]

00:57.480 --> 00:58.629
We should go.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.597
There's a storm coming.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.034
Dog!

01:02.120 --> 01:06.591
[Dog barks, panting]

[Growling]

02:19.880 --> 02:22.269
[indistinct conversations, hoof beats]

02:22.360 --> 02:24.317
Gabriel: You are here.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.834
Aware of yourself.

02:25.920 --> 02:27.672
Can't get me!

02:27.760 --> 02:28.795
Just let it go.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.870
-[Laughs]
- Better watch out!

02:30.000 --> 02:31.434
Girl: Hey, wait for me!

02:31.520 --> 02:34.478
- Gabriel: Don't judge the distraction.
- Boy: There it is!

02:34.560 --> 02:36.312
Girl: [Singsong voice]
Scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat.

02:36.400 --> 02:41.793
Gabriel: Accept it, consider it,
and then release it.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.349
Just let it wash over you.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.317
[Laughter in distance]

02:46.400 --> 02:47.913
It's all right--

02:48.000 --> 02:49.718
You know what? Screw it.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.030
Screw it. My mind never
"empties," anyway.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.713
Generally goes straight to that place

02:53.800 --> 02:56.314
that would blush the collar
right off of you.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.959
[Sighs]

02:58.040 --> 03:01.556
Although, now that
you and Rosita are a thing,

03:01.640 --> 03:02.914
maybe I'm wrong.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.514
- I mean...
-[Ball bouncing]

03:05.600 --> 03:07.113
...hot damn.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.795
I want to understand
why you do this.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.713
You clearly want help.
I can see you trying.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.950
Yeah. [Chuckles]

03:16.040 --> 03:18.953
Maybe we cooked it up, chewed it up,

03:19.040 --> 03:20.997
and shat it out already.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.037
Maybe this is all we get.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.078
You don't feel like
you're getting any benefit

03:26.160 --> 03:27.594
to our sessions?

03:27.680 --> 03:30.559
Well, I am reminded
that another week has passed,

03:30.640 --> 03:32.039
but other than that?

03:32.120 --> 03:33.633
[Ball bouncing]

03:33.720 --> 03:35.711
-[Sighs]
-[Chuckles]

03:35.800 --> 03:39.031
Ah, don't take it personally, Gabe.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.556
I know I'm never getting out of here.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.758
I do appreciate you coming
down here and helping me

03:45.840 --> 03:49.037
when that was touch and go for me.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.999
But now I got everything I need.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.833
This little window right here--

03:54.960 --> 03:56.997
it's as good as a TV.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.991
And I loved the shit outta TV

03:59.080 --> 04:00.753
back when that was a thing.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.195
Acceptance is an important first step.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.429
[Ball bouncing]

04:04.520 --> 04:06.352
But a life needs to have meaning.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.829
Funny thing about this window here.

04:08.920 --> 04:12.151
People stand out there, and they talk.

04:12.240 --> 04:15.790
And it's like they don't
remember I'm here.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.233
And that--

04:17.360 --> 04:20.796
well, that is when
I get the really good shit.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.154
[Ball bouncing]

04:22.280 --> 04:23.600
You know, just the other day,

04:23.680 --> 04:26.559
Rosita was out there chatting up a storm.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.392
She said some things

04:28.480 --> 04:30.198
that you would find very interesting.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.918
[Ball bouncing]

04:32.040 --> 04:34.395
I don't need you to tell me
how Rosita feels about me.

04:35.520 --> 04:39.514
Now, who said
she was talking about you?

04:39.600 --> 04:41.034
[Ball bouncing]

04:41.120 --> 04:43.031
We'll try this again next week.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.839
It's your world, boss.

04:45.920 --> 04:48.196

[Hoof beats]

05:08.200 --> 05:10.237
Who are those men?

05:10.320 --> 05:11.515
Messengers.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.749
Came all the way from Hilltop.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.239
They found Rosita.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.640
She's hurt.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.469
Riders!

05:20.560 --> 05:22.949
Riders are coming!

05:23.040 --> 05:26.112
- Go, quick!
- Riders are coming!

05:26.200 --> 05:27.429
Riders!

05:27.520 --> 05:30.353
- Riders are coming!
- Oh!

Riders are coming!

<i>H9'!-</i>

06:02.360 --> 06:04.556
You guys seeing this?

06:39.080 --> 06:41.196
How many?

06:41.280 --> 06:43.032
Six.

06:43.120 --> 06:47.273
No, wait...

07:04.960 --> 07:06.359
Be ready.

07:06.440 --> 07:07.953
Be patient.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.951
If it were me,
I'd have you up on that wall

07:10.040 --> 07:11.360
ready to shoot an arrow

07:11.440 --> 07:13.238
at anyone I didn't like the looks of.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.516
What's not to like about us?

07:15.600 --> 07:17.750
We're a solid-looking group.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.070
We're scrappy-

07:24.680 --> 07:27.354
State your business.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.795
We're here for Rosita.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.394
We met your messengers on the road.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.710
They told us what happened.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.074
And the others?

07:36.160 --> 07:38.720
They're good people
looking for a home.

07:38.800 --> 07:42.350
I told them Hilltop
would consider taking them in.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.118
[Birds chirping]

08:39.159 --> 08:41.275
Out with the search party
looking for Eugene.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.828
Eugene's missing? Since when?

08:43.960 --> 08:45.678
I dunno. Thought you would.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.114
He went out with Rosita,

08:47.200 --> 08:48.952
but wasn't with her
when we found her.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.276
How is she?

08:53.360 --> 08:55.317
She was unconscious
when she got here,

08:55.400 --> 08:56.754
but she'll be fine.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.558
It's dehydration
and heat exhaustion, mainly.

08:58.680 --> 08:59.909
She should wake up soon.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.149
If she's been out the entire time,

09:01.240 --> 09:02.389
how do you know
Eugene was with her?

09:02.520 --> 09:05.399
- Aaron told us.
- Aaron's here?

09:05.520 --> 09:07.193
No, he's with Jesus and Daryl.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.078
Daryl came down from his mountain

09:09.160 --> 09:10.878
with Carol and Henry.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.634
It's like the old gang's back together.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.040
Which way were they headed?

09:15.120 --> 09:16.713
Alden: You can pick up their trail,

09:16.800 --> 09:18.552
but you're not gonna catch them
before nightfall.

09:18.640 --> 09:19.835
Tara: It's Daryl.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.150
Probably on their way back already.

09:22.240 --> 09:25.198
You can have your weapons back
when you leave tomorrow.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.550
As for the rest of you,

09:28.640 --> 09:31.234
you're gonna have to wait
until Jesus gets back.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.072
And if you want to stay, stay,

09:33.160 --> 09:34.833
I'm gonna have to talk to him.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.560
And you're gonna have to earn your keep.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.910
[Footsteps approach]

09:44.400 --> 09:46.789
She says, "Thank you."

09:48.000 --> 09:49.957
We all do.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.155
Okay.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.679
It's good we're here.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.149
Yeah...

10:15.600 --> 10:19.195
[Gate creaks]

10:24.360 --> 10:26.829
[Gate closes]

10:36.400 --> 10:38.755
So, the guy running things here

10:38.840 --> 10:40.114
calls himself "Jesus"?

10:40.240 --> 10:41.913
Sounds like a cult to me.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.873
Well, let's assume that [Chuckling] it is.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.394
If we plan on staying awhile,

10:48.480 --> 10:50.198
we should be thinking about
how to prove our worth.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.714
Michonne: So, what else don't I know?

10:51.800 --> 10:53.677
I didn't know anything about
Eugene and Rosita--

10:53.760 --> 10:55.558
But you knew Aaron
was working a backchannel--

10:55.640 --> 10:57.995
Hilltop is not a backchannel, Michonne.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.674
We're talking about our friends here.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.320
Hi, Carol.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.754
Siddiq.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.877
.H6Y-
.H6Y-

11:15.280 --> 11:16.839
I didn't expect to see you here.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.719
Same.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.438
Who are your friends?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.238
We're not friends yet.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.799
<i>I'm Magma.</i>

11:24.880 --> 11:26.598
This is Yumiko and Connie.

11:32.160 --> 11:34.993
Sorry. That's all I know. [Chuckles]

11:35.080 --> 11:37.071
It's nice to meet you, too.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.436
Come on, let's figure out
where they're putting us up.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.477
- How's--
-lS--

11:47.600 --> 11:48.954
You first.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.270
How's Judith and RJ?

11:51.360 --> 11:53.795
Good. Really good.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.919
RJ's gonna be as tall as Judith
any minute now.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.993
Is Ezekiel here, too?

12:01.080 --> 12:02.275
No. Just me.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.636
I'm dropping off Henry.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.870
He's gonna be apprenticing
with the blacksmith.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.359
- Good for him.
- Mm-hmm.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.477
He's a good kid.
He's got a big heart.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.631
And he sees his home falling apart,

12:12.720 --> 12:14.757
and he wants to help out.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.070
I read Ezekiel's letter.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.231
And I'm sorry for your troubles.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.880
You can still help.
We really need this fair.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.633
If Alexandria could just send
a delegation--

12:23.760 --> 12:25.717
I'm sorry.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.029
I am.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.077
I didn't want to turn you down.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.958
You of all people.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.474
But we've had our troubles, too.

12:32.560 --> 12:33.675
You know that.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.195
I know what you went through.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.079
And I get why this is hard for you.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.549
But we've all lost something.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.075
You and me, we both lost children.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.077
And we kept going.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.952
For each other.
We've always been a family.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.873
And we still are.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.315
But Kingdom is Kingdom,

12:53.400 --> 12:57.394
Hilltop is here,
and Alexandria is there,

12:57.480 --> 13:01.360
and in between,
there's a whole lot of broken world,

13:01.440 --> 13:04.000
and we cannot pretend otherwise.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.959
We've got to take care of our own now.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.111
It's just the way it is.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.316
That's a shame.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.549
It is.

13:12.640 --> 13:15.792
It was good to see you.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.999
Give Ezekiel and Henry my best.

13:34.240 --> 13:37.710
Aaron: Daryl says he's been
trading with Hilltop again.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.191
Jesus: He used to come like
clockwork a couple times a year.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.793
Never stayed, though.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.599
The gaps between the trips
got longer and longer.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.751
Prefers it out here, I suppose.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.275
Sounds like somebody else I know.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.954
[Chuckles] We used to be explorers.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.951
The whole world was ours to rediscover.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.951
Well, we were out looking for people.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.759
Offering them a chance to be
a part of something bigger.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.399
Because of you,

14:02.480 --> 14:03.675
we were able to find each other.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.230
Maybe showing those people
a way forward

14:07.320 --> 14:08.754
is the next step in that.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.877
- I just don't think that I'm--
- I do.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.758
I think you'd be a damn good leader

14:12.840 --> 14:15.229
if you'd just stop fighting it.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.596
You think that's what I'm doing?

14:17.680 --> 14:21.071
He's spent a long time
keeping people away,

14:21.160 --> 14:22.594
but finding them...

14:22.680 --> 14:24.398
it's kind of his thing.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.800
Stay.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.440
Maybe one day,
he'll stop fighting it, too.

Let's put some ground
between us and them.

Yeah.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.956
Mind if I hitch a ride?

15:12.040 --> 15:13.917
Back to Kingdom?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.673
I talked to Tara.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.400
The Kingdom needs me now
more than Hilltop does.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.955
I'd like the company.

an advance on my pay.

for you to take home.

You didn't have to do that.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.475
We'll take good care of him.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.119
It's all right.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.555
I wouldn't be leaving
if I didn't trust him.

Mm-hmm.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.399
I'm gonna make you proud.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.354
Yeah.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.636
Looks like more than double that now.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.836
Could be a different herd.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.270
Or it merged with another one.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.034
Ain't gonna be there very long.

It's good.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.233
Good.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.118
Yeah, um, Alden is showing me
how to make a spearhead.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.998
He's picking it up fast.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.514
Well, of course he is.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.193
Maybe we should keep him

17:54.280 --> 17:56.191
and send you back to the Kingdom.

[Chuckles] You got a sec?

After dinner.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.831
Thought you might like to come over

18:13.920 --> 18:15.399
and spend the evening
with Tammy and me.

18:15.480 --> 18:19.235

I read something fascinating

18:26.520 --> 18:27.749
the other day.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.229
You know what a smell
is?

18:30.320 --> 18:32.038
It's when odor molecules

18:32.120 --> 18:35.112
activate neurons in your nasal passages.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.634
So every time you come in here

18:36.760 --> 18:39.673
to change my bedpan and smell my shit,

18:39.760 --> 18:42.434
something that was actually in my ass

18:42.520 --> 18:44.796
goes right up your nose.

Shut up.

I'm sorry.

I never know exactly which eye
I'm supposed to look at.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.240
It's a little bit distracting.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.874
Just. Shut. Up.

For once in your life,
shut your damn mouth.

I keep scratching at you.

I keep trying to figure out
what's underneath it all,

19:07.360 --> 19:09.078
'cause I think, if I dig deep enough,

19:09.160 --> 19:10.878
I'll find a person.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.274
Someone I can help.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.318
But I never do. All I find is more--

19:16.440 --> 19:18.795
What happened?

19:21.280 --> 19:24.079
Rosita's at Hilltop.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.278
I sent her out, and she got hurt.

The messenger doesn't know

19:28.640 --> 19:29.914
what happened or how bad it is.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.709
And I can't go to help her

19:33.800 --> 19:36.713
because I have to be here with you.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.314
Because somebody has to stay behind

19:39.400 --> 19:41.994
to be responsible for you.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.711
I'm sorry, man. I didn't know.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.154
Don't.

for fun around here.

be angry, but...

that doesn't make it any easier.

No.

No, but it's not too late

23:02.400 --> 23:03.993

23:04.080 --> 23:05.798
because I thought they'd be easy.

so they can hate me for it.

going on, they can handle it.
