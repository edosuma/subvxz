01:58.118 --> 01:59.995
<i>Five years.</i>

02:00.854 --> 02:03.562
<i>I remember when I
couldn't get five days.</i>

02:17.804 --> 02:19.442
<i>What's your name?</i>

02:20.039 --> 02:22.781
<i>Hey. Adam. Sex addict.</i>

02:23.376 --> 02:25.083
<i>- Hi, Adam.
- Hi, Adam.</i>

02:29.782 --> 02:31.591
<i>I never want to get cocky
about this, you know?</i>

02:31.651 --> 02:33.858
I never want to be,
like, "Yo, look at me.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.992
"I got it all. I got five years.
I got it all figured out."

02:37.056 --> 02:38.831
<i>I've had to make it
a practice.</i>

02:38.892 --> 02:44.706
<i>I have to remind myself every day
where this disease could take me.</i>

02:49.569 --> 02:54.951
I have to remember jonesing, feeling like I
was gonna fucking die if I didn't have sex.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.618
I've got to be vigilant, you know?
I can't...

02:59.212 --> 03:02.216
I can't be easy with
myself in this program.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.567
<i>So, yeah.</i>

03:12.659 --> 03:15.469
<i>lam grateful to be
sober today.</i>

03:15.528 --> 03:16.529
<i>Thanks.</i>

03:17.197 --> 03:19.473
Thanks for letting me share.

03:51.364 --> 03:52.843
What are you doing?

03:53.333 --> 03:56.143
Hey, I'm Neil. I'm a sexy...

03:56.202 --> 03:58.045
I'm a sex addict.

03:58.104 --> 03:59.845
- Hi, Neil.
- Hi, Neil.

04:00.440 --> 04:04.911
Thanks so much for your share, Adam.
That's some powerful shit, man. Damn.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.617
All right, so let me check in.

04:07.513 --> 04:09.322
How am I doing?

04:11.217 --> 04:13.219
You know, I'm good, actually.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.328
I'm feeling pretty good.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.426
Work's good. Work's great.

04:19.024 --> 04:20.402
All right, what do we got?

04:20.459 --> 04:22.701
Twenty-something male
presenting polysubstance OD.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.208
We gave him the Narcan, then he 
woke up, starting pulling everything,

04:25.265 --> 04:26.505
- and then went out again.
- Got it.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.404
Sir? Can you hear me?

04:30.903 --> 04:32.541
Can you tell me your name, bud?

04:32.605 --> 04:33.879
All right, belly's distended.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.942
Let's get an IV set up
and then put a Foley in.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.420
Put it in what?

04:39.379 --> 04:40.881
Damn.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.893
Looks like a bird egg in a nest.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.789
Poor guy probably
needs a squirrel to jerk him off.

04:45.852 --> 04:46.956
Don't you think?

04:47.020 --> 04:49.762
It kind of looks like
an elevator button.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.824
Third floor. Beep.

04:53.926 --> 04:55.564
Dr. Garalla?

04:55.628 --> 04:58.404
Can I see you over here
for a second, please?

04:59.132 --> 05:02.602
<i>You know, but I gotta say it's working.
Totally working.</i>

05:03.036 --> 05:07.542
I haven't touched myself in
about a month, which is crazy,

05:08.574 --> 05:12.647
'cause I remember, you know, when I first
heard about the no masturbation rule,

05:12.712 --> 05:16.683
I was, like, "Okay, should I
not breathe while I'm at it?"

05:17.116 --> 05:19.221
Should I not breathe while I'm at it?

05:19.452 --> 05:22.592
All right, well, that wraps it up.

05:22.789 --> 05:24.268
Thanks for letting me share.

05:25.992 --> 05:26.993
Yeah.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.636
Thanks. I'm Mike,
gratefully recovering sex addict.

05:30.697 --> 05:31.971
- Hi, Mike.
- Hi, Mike.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.568
I'm proud of you, birthday boy.

05:34.634 --> 05:35.704
- Really proud.
- Thanks.

05:35.802 --> 05:37.475
And I'm proud to be your sponsor.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.883
<i>So, what's going on with me?Let's see.</i>

05:41.774 --> 05:45.654
<i>Well, I'm grateful to be sober.</i>

05:47.547 --> 05:51.996
<i>Been taking
some visual drinks on the streets.</i>

05:53.419 --> 05:57.333
<i>Is it me, or is Manhattan</i>
<i>just one big fucking catwalk?</i>

05:59.425 --> 06:00.836
Hey.

06:01.394 --> 06:02.930
Hey.

06:03.863 --> 06:09.745
I'm really embarrassed to say this,
but I forgot your name.

06:10.670 --> 06:15.710
You guys have heard me say this before.
This disease is a fucking bitch.

06:16.809 --> 06:21.758
Now I have been sober
15 years in the beverage program.

06:21.814 --> 06:23.384
No problem.

06:23.483 --> 06:26.760
This thing is a whole
different animal.

06:27.086 --> 06:32.126
It's like trying to quit crack while
the pipe's attached to your body.

06:37.363 --> 06:40.435
Who serves stale bread?
It's completely stale.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.606
- Have you decided yet?
- Yeah, just one moment.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.307
What's tempeh again?

06:45.371 --> 06:48.511
- Just order the pancakes, Mike.
- Maybe I want to try something different.

06:48.574 --> 06:53.922
You know what you should get?
It's the salmon scramble. It's so good.

06:53.980 --> 06:57.621
This time I'm going to go for the

06:58.718 --> 06:59.958
pancakes.

07:02.321 --> 07:04.164
Get off my back.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.631
How's work?

07:08.094 --> 07:11.041
It's pretty good.
We just landed the postal service.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.098
What?

07:12.165 --> 07:14.372
Yup, we're going to be helping
them green all their packaging.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.004
- That's huge. The postal service.
- Right. Yeah.

07:16.068 --> 07:19.709
That's an oxymoron, right?
The postal service.

07:19.772 --> 07:24.482
It's like jumbo shrimp
or military intelligence.

07:24.577 --> 07:28.115
No. It's actually not
an oxymoron at all.

07:28.214 --> 07:31.423
They actually deliver the mail.
Postal service.

07:31.484 --> 07:34.090
- But the...
- See, there's no... There's actually no...

07:34.153 --> 07:37.999
- No, but there is. They're having issues.
- Not at all. Not an oxymoron.

07:41.761 --> 07:44.537
So how's the dating?

07:47.166 --> 07:48.736
- What?
- it's...

07:49.068 --> 07:50.945
Come on, you got five years.
It's time.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.745
The point isn't to live like a monk.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.354
- It's easy to be skinny on a desert island.
- I know. I know. I know.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.890
It's not like booze or drugs.
You don't have to shut it off completely.

07:59.946 --> 08:00.981
Jesus, I'll start dating.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.391
- Don't just say that to shut me up.
- What do you want me to say?

08:03.516 --> 08:04.859
I don't want you to say anything.
I want you to do.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.487
- Okay, fine. I'll do it.
- Do. Date.

08:06.552 --> 08:07.929
- You are?
- Yes. I'm doing it.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.022
Yeah? Good.

08:09.088 --> 08:10.761
Why couldn't I have
picked an easy sponsor?

08:10.823 --> 08:11.137
Why?

08:11.163 --> 08:12.418
I don't know. Maybe
you wanted to recover.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.404
Why are you riding me?

08:14.894 --> 08:16.965
Here. This is for you.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.075
- Subtle.
- If you want to bust my balls...

08:24.136 --> 08:26.275
No! No, no, no! I love it!
Are you kidding me?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.376
I always wanted
one of your touchy-feely rocks.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.443
I want one.
I want a touchy-feely rock, too.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.750
So fucking earn it.

08:38.551 --> 08:41.929
So I'm going to hear your
first step after this, right?

08:42.255 --> 08:43.756
Oh, shit.

08:44.155 --> 08:45.157
Neil.

08:45.224 --> 08:47.602
Dude, I've been working
on it all week.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.571
I totally, totally forgot
that we were doing that today.

08:49.629 --> 08:52.303
You do remember
why you're in this program, right?

08:52.832 --> 08:55.540
- Free bagels?
- You were court ordered.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.639
- Frottage.
- I know.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.708
- Unconsensual touching of other people.
- I know.

09:01.774 --> 09:04.414
Listen, Neil, you gotta do the work.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.320
You have to do whatever it takes.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.417
You think I like
not having a television or a laptop?

09:09.482 --> 09:13.089
It fucking blows. But guess what?
It's saving my life, so I do it.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.533
- Is any of this of interest to you, Neil?
- Yes, it's all of interest to me.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.093
Can we please move on?
I'll get it done this week. Thank you.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.166
What happened to your face?

09:23.296 --> 09:24.775
Nothing.

11:21.047 --> 11:23.084
My fellow gastronauts.

11:23.149 --> 11:26.562
I bring you good tidings
and good eatings.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.661
Let's bug out.

11:42.535 --> 11:47.211
No, Pinocch, don't do it!
It's me, Jimmy. Put the stick down!

11:48.274 --> 11:52.120
Well, you should have thought about that
before you ratted me out to Geppetto.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.887
That's not my real voice.

11:56.949 --> 11:59.225
Well, then sorry, I'm...

11:59.318 --> 12:01.924
No! Come back! I'm Adam.

12:01.987 --> 12:04.092
- I'm Phoebe.
- Hi, Phoebe.

12:04.690 --> 12:07.136
You are a very cruel man, Adam.

12:07.293 --> 12:10.297
Believe me, it hurts them
far more than it hurts me.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.642
Don't you mean that
the other way around?

12:12.765 --> 12:14.836
No, Phoebe, I don't.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.471
So what you making?

12:58.677 --> 13:00.748
- Flip phone, huh?
- Yeah.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.584
You ever carbon dated this thing?

13:03.349 --> 13:04.760
What are you doing?

13:05.284 --> 13:07.560
Don't be so slow, Pinocchio.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.119
Mike.

13:37.116 --> 13:39.995
Mike, there's someone downstairs.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.325
What?

13:42.454 --> 13:45.162
There's someone downstairs. Get up.

14:08.714 --> 14:10.785
Dad! It's me.

14:10.883 --> 14:12.055
Danny?

14:12.418 --> 14:13.954
I used the Hide-a-Key.

14:14.119 --> 14:18.363
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I wanted to come see you guys.

14:18.757 --> 14:22.637
So you just decided
you'd stop by for a midnight chat?

14:23.162 --> 14:24.800
I've been driving all day.
I didn't have a chance...

14:24.864 --> 14:26.138
So you're hungry.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.940
So you figured
you'd eat our food and then rob us.

14:31.403 --> 14:35.283
I'm not going to rob you, Dad.
I haven't used in eight months.

14:35.341 --> 14:36.684
Yeah, right.

14:37.509 --> 14:39.955
I wouldn't believe me either,
I guess, but it's true.

14:40.646 --> 14:43.490
You know how I know
an addict is lying?

14:43.782 --> 14:45.762
His lips are moving.

14:47.653 --> 14:49.257
Mom up there?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.497
She's sleeping.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.035
Danny?

14:55.561 --> 14:56.869
Hey, Mom.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.198
Danny!

15:00.165 --> 15:01.542
Hey.

15:05.504 --> 15:07.211
Oh, my...

15:08.641 --> 15:10.814
Look at you!

15:12.077 --> 15:17.959
Kid's stolen money,
sports equipment, his mom's necklace.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.995
Never once said he's sorry.

15:22.821 --> 15:25.927
You know, I've tried to
get him in the rooms.

15:26.025 --> 15:28.767
And you know what they say,

15:28.827 --> 15:32.365
"This is a program for people that
want it, not for people who need it."

15:36.468 --> 15:40.177
Hi. Dede. New to the program.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.042
- Hi, Dede.
- Hi, Dede.

15:44.643 --> 15:46.384
There's a lot of dudes in here.

15:47.513 --> 15:50.357
Sorry, my other program
isn't such a sausage fest.

15:53.986 --> 15:59.129
My NA sponsor said I needed
to come here because...

16:00.159 --> 16:02.332
"Tell the truth and tell it fast."

16:02.528 --> 16:06.203
The only way
I know how to relate to men is sex.

16:06.665 --> 16:09.145
It's been that way forever.

16:09.835 --> 16:14.250
I can remember my mom screaming at me

16:14.306 --> 16:17.879
for grinding on my cousin
when I was, like, four years old.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.551
I took my neighbor's virginity by force
when I was 12,

16:22.848 --> 16:27.456
seduced my high school English teacher, got
him fired when he tried to break it off.

16:27.886 --> 16:29.422
My 20s,

16:30.322 --> 16:35.567
two abortions,
one long game of musical fuck chairs.

16:37.696 --> 16:43.271
So now I'm 30, single,
no dude, no kids.

16:47.106 --> 16:51.987
And I just lost my best friend in the
whole world because I fucked her old man.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.758
I didn't even like the douchebag.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.561
But that's what I do.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.361
There's gotta be another way.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.942
There has to be,
or I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.310
So that's what I got.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.009
Thanks.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.384
- Keep coming back.
- Keep coming back.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.092
At this meeting, we give out chips

17:29.148 --> 17:32.857
to recognize and celebrate sexual
sobriety and to help us in our recovery.

17:32.918 --> 17:35.296
We have found through
our experience that sobriety

17:35.354 --> 17:39.234
includes freedom from masturbation and
sex outside of a committed relationship.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.971
Is anybody celebrating 30 days?

17:50.202 --> 17:52.182
Good for you. Good going.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.985
Anybody else, 30 days?

17:58.877 --> 18:01.323
All right, all right!

18:11.523 --> 18:14.026
Anybody else? Anybody else?
Thirty days?

18:17.229 --> 18:19.539
Hey, Friar Tuck. What's going on?

18:20.165 --> 18:22.202
Friar Tuck is going on a date.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.213
- Yeah.
- Way to go!

18:26.305 --> 18:29.684
Well, so what are we talking?
Male, female or shemale?

18:29.741 --> 18:32.312
Hey, babe, you told
me to get out there.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.350
Well, I'm proud of you.
That's good news. That's good news.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.292
- You going to fellowship?
- No, I can't.

18:39.351 --> 18:42.821
I'm meeting up with my sponsee
to go over his first step.

18:42.888 --> 18:44.060
Who, Shecky Greene?

18:47.693 --> 18:50.640
So let's get started. Got your book?

18:51.263 --> 18:55.109
Yeah, my book. So here's the deal.
I didn't really get to...

18:55.167 --> 18:57.044
It's okay. Just let me see it.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.877
I'm operating on, like,
four hours of sleep.

18:58.937 --> 19:01.213
It's fine. We'll just... We'll get it.
We'll get started.

19:01.273 --> 19:04.152
I just... I would have liked
a little bit more time.

19:04.209 --> 19:05.586
Is this it?

19:07.546 --> 19:09.958
I didn't get a chance
to do what I wanted to do.

19:10.349 --> 19:11.521
So, no.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.187
I'm gonna have a lot more time
this week to work on it.

19:13.252 --> 19:15.721
No, man.
This isn't gonna work for me. No.

19:15.747 --> 19:16.952
What do you want?

19:17.322 --> 19:22.237
Look, you're wasting my time.
This is a complete waste of my time.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.637
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
I can't work with you.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.733
Take it. Take the book.

19:26.798 --> 19:28.744
You can't... 
What, are you dropping me?

19:28.800 --> 19:32.111
I am sorry. What else...
What other choice do I have, really?

19:32.171 --> 19:35.152
I just got a 30-day chip in there,
and you're firing me?

19:35.207 --> 19:37.710
- Neil...
- No, that is all sorts of fucked up, man.

19:37.776 --> 19:41.189
Neil, I told you from the beginning
that you had to do the work.

19:41.246 --> 19:43.385
You haven't done
a single thing in this book.

19:43.448 --> 19:44.950
- Try doing my job.
- What are you talking about?

19:45.017 --> 19:47.327
- This is bullshit.
- Are you out of your mind?

19:47.386 --> 19:49.195
I need this, okay?

19:49.388 --> 19:51.368
I need you to sign my court card.

19:52.391 --> 19:56.134
- There it is. That's what this is about?
- That's not what this is about.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.176
Don't worry, Neil.
The chairperson can sign your card.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.734
You don't need me and
I don't need this.

20:08.840 --> 20:13.789
The pages are all stuck fucking together.
If it wasn't you, then who?

20:16.081 --> 20:21.258
Who the fuck brought my book outside?
Who the fuck left my book outside?

20:21.353 --> 20:22.798
Who?

20:23.188 --> 20:24.394
Who?

20:25.090 --> 20:27.263
Just tell me who.

20:27.326 --> 20:29.636
If it wasn't you, then who?

20:29.695 --> 20:31.003
Who?

20:31.496 --> 20:34.204
- Who? You know what...
- Shut the fuck up!

20:35.100 --> 20:36.477
Asshole.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.310
What's all this?

20:41.707 --> 20:43.778
Danny's making us breakfast.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.816
This will be interesting.

20:47.079 --> 20:51.186
I have not seen my son in years.
Can you try not chasing him away?

20:53.285 --> 20:54.491
Here we go.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.325
Breakfast a la Danny.

20:57.389 --> 21:00.700
Look at this. It's so fancy.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.098
What's this gonna cost us?

21:05.063 --> 21:07.976
- Nothing.
- Okay.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.637
There's some butter there
if you want it, Ma.

21:09.701 --> 21:11.339
Thank you.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.713
This is really good.

21:19.911 --> 21:22.619
I tried to get yours back, but...

21:24.216 --> 21:26.628
- Oh, honey.
- it's the best I could do.

21:33.425 --> 21:36.304
- Will you put it on me?
- Yeah, of course.

21:37.829 --> 21:42.938
So, yeah, I mean, after my
stretch, I bounced around a lot.

21:43.068 --> 21:48.450
I worked an oil rig off the Gulf of Mexico,
picked spinach in Central Valley, California.

21:48.507 --> 21:51.647
- Really?
- Yeah. Just basically saw the country.

21:52.210 --> 21:54.554
And you've been sober the whole time?

21:55.147 --> 21:56.455
Yeah.

21:56.548 --> 21:58.425
Just white-knuckling it?

22:02.988 --> 22:05.559
Yeah, you know, not everybody
needs to go with AA, Dad.

22:05.724 --> 22:06.794
Is that right?

22:07.759 --> 22:11.104
Yeah, some people
don't need a group to lean on.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.665
Some people can do it on their own.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.609
Hasn't been my experience.

22:19.104 --> 22:21.516
- You want more coffee?
- Yes, please.

22:25.877 --> 22:27.322
What?

22:42.594 --> 22:43.868
Hey.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.875
- Hello.
- Hello.

22:50.369 --> 22:54.647
If I knew we were gonna be racing, I
would have worn my Livestrong bracelet.

22:55.674 --> 22:57.654
You know,
this actually might be a good time

22:57.709 --> 23:01.555
to tell you that
I had breast cancer five years ago.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.488
Oh, God, really?

23:06.284 --> 23:07.763
Yeah.

23:11.022 --> 23:14.299
- That's a tough break. I'm sorry.
- Yeah, it was.

23:14.359 --> 23:18.102
But it's fine. I'm fine now, so...

23:18.163 --> 23:20.074
I'm glad to hear that.

23:21.933 --> 23:25.346
So I see you're perspiring a tad.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.907
I just ran 10K.

23:29.307 --> 23:33.551
Okay, my initial reaction is to say,
"Well, I just ran a marathon."

23:33.612 --> 23:36.115
But I can't tell
if you're joking or if you're serious.

23:36.181 --> 23:38.161
I'm as serious as cancer.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.655
Wait, you just ran a 10K?

23:42.421 --> 23:45.459
I'm training for the
New York Triathlon.

23:48.193 --> 23:54.769
Okay, we need a system here,
some signs to signify.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.904
So when we're serious,
we have to do this.

23:56.968 --> 24:01.474
I love that. Okay. Yes, Adam, I'm serious.
I'm training for a triathlon.

24:01.540 --> 24:05.010
Okay.
Okay, you seriously scare/impress me.

24:05.076 --> 24:06.146
Thank you.

24:06.745 --> 24:09.885
And when we're joking,
we can do that.

24:10.315 --> 24:12.522
Did you just pay homage to The Sting?

24:12.984 --> 24:15.487
- My God, you're hot.
- No, you're hot.

24:17.055 --> 24:19.763
What? No, you are.
You're actually very hot.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.862
- Thanks.
- You're extremely hot.

24:26.064 --> 24:28.101
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

24:28.166 --> 24:32.774
I'm just getting warmed up here.
I'm ready to go now.

24:43.014 --> 24:45.324
How you doing back there?

24:45.383 --> 24:48.125
I'm fine. I'm just drafting.

24:48.186 --> 24:49.460
Okay.

25:10.942 --> 25:12.012
Doctor.

25:12.677 --> 25:16.147
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.487
Yeah, you know, I just...

25:18.583 --> 25:21.058
I really wanted to
apologize for all the

25:21.084 --> 25:23.921
joking around and stuff
that I do around here.

25:23.955 --> 25:29.303
You know, I think it's really, to be
honest, like, a defense mechanism.

25:29.494 --> 25:32.737
You know, for all the pressures
we have here as doctors.

25:32.797 --> 25:35.073
Thank you.
Thank you, that's good to hear.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.543
I think it's also a...

25:37.602 --> 25:41.049
I think it's also
kind of a product of my childhood.

25:41.172 --> 25:42.583
My mom, God bless her,

25:42.641 --> 25:47.147
she's still alive, but, you know, she was
really sick a lot when I was growing up.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.919
She had IBS, bad,

25:48.980 --> 25:53.326
and the only thing that really made her feel
better was when I would make her laugh.

25:53.385 --> 25:56.161
Apology accepted, okay?
Now if you'll excuse me...

26:01.059 --> 26:02.470
Wait...

26:12.771 --> 26:16.082
So I think we can go ahead
and untuck that now.

26:16.141 --> 26:19.054
But that's part of my
intended ensemble.

26:19.110 --> 26:21.886
Okay. And then I'll tuck it back in.

26:22.013 --> 26:23.720
Nice re-tucking.

26:25.116 --> 26:27.118
Would you care for a little GU?

26:27.586 --> 26:28.792
Goo?

26:30.188 --> 26:32.464
I'm new to goo. I...

26:34.659 --> 26:36.366
Oh, dear.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.306
You kind of got some
on your face there.

26:41.366 --> 26:43.903
- Did I get it?
- Lower. Lower.

26:43.969 --> 26:46.313
- It's still there?
- Nope. It's on your chin.

26:46.371 --> 26:47.816
My Shin?

26:48.073 --> 26:49.984
It's on your chin.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.248
My chin. Which one?

26:52.611 --> 26:55.888
Just... Right...

26:55.947 --> 26:57.585
- That...
- Right there.

27:21.406 --> 27:24.478
- I think I need a drink.
- I think I need one, too.

27:25.677 --> 27:28.180
Wait, you're not an
alcoholic, are you?

27:29.381 --> 27:31.759
- No. Why?
- Okay.

27:32.183 --> 27:34.424
No, because
my last boyfriend was an alcoholic,

27:34.486 --> 27:37.262
and I promised myself
I'd never date an addict again.

27:40.225 --> 27:44.867
Well, I'm not an alcoholic.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.207
Great.

27:55.106 --> 27:58.610
So my son got really
upset the other day

27:58.677 --> 28:01.749
'cause I told him he had to
stop playing and do his homework.

28:02.047 --> 28:04.152
And I understand how he feels,

28:04.215 --> 28:07.628
but I couldn't say to him,
like, you know, "Don't you think

28:07.686 --> 28:11.691
"I'd rather be alone with ajar of blow
and a couple of transsexual hookers?"

28:16.027 --> 28:17.062
Not that he would know...

28:17.128 --> 28:20.268
I mean, he doesn't know
what the word "jar" means, but...

28:24.069 --> 28:25.275
Neil.

28:27.072 --> 28:29.552
Hey. Neil. Sex addict.

28:29.607 --> 28:30.950
- Hi, Neil.
- Hi, Neil.

28:31.009 --> 28:32.181
Hey.

28:33.645 --> 28:38.458
I dreamed of being a doctor
since I was 10 years old.

28:39.284 --> 28:41.594
It all started with ER.

28:42.654 --> 28:45.999
I knew I could never be George Clooney,
but Anthony Edwards...

28:46.658 --> 28:51.505
Bald, glasses, saving lives like
a superhero, that I could do.

28:53.331 --> 28:59.577
So I worked nonstop for many years with
no social life, and I finally did it.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.609
I became a doctor.

29:03.842 --> 29:06.049
I was really good at it, too.

29:06.711 --> 29:12.161
Until I got fired yesterday
for filming up my boss' skirt.

29:15.453 --> 29:18.923
I told her it was for a documentary
called What the Ground Sees.

29:19.791 --> 29:21.964
Oddly enough, she didn't buy it.

29:23.795 --> 29:26.401
Stop fucking around, asshole!

29:29.534 --> 29:32.811
It's not funny anymore, is it? Nope.

29:36.808 --> 29:40.346
I've been lying about my day count
this entire time.

29:41.813 --> 29:44.293
I've never actually
even gotten one day.

29:48.419 --> 29:50.330
I can't lie anymore.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.834
Not to you, not to myself.

29:57.595 --> 30:01.975
So from now on, no more bullshit.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.611
Just the truth.

30:07.972 --> 30:10.145
And the truth is...

30:13.678 --> 30:15.988
I'm out of control.

30:18.716 --> 30:20.491
I'm scared.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.763
And I need help.

30:27.759 --> 30:29.670
I need help.

30:30.829 --> 30:34.072
Okay, Neil, if we're gonna do this again,
then you gotta give me 150%.

30:34.132 --> 30:35.133
Okay.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.147
And since you're not working,
you have to do a 90 in 90.

30:38.203 --> 30:40.444
- What is that?
- Ninety meetings in 90 days.

30:40.505 --> 30:41.643
Okay.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.117
- Call me every day.
- Fine.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.585
You pray every day.

30:44.943 --> 30:46.752
- I'm kind of an atheist.
- All right.

30:46.811 --> 30:50.759
Okay! All right, fine.
Dude, I'll do whatever I gotta do.

30:50.882 --> 30:51.883
Listen to me.

30:51.983 --> 30:55.055
Higher power doesn't have to be some
old dude with a beard in the sky, okay?

30:55.119 --> 30:56.894
It just has to be something
that's bigger than you.

30:57.055 --> 30:58.363
I'm pretty big.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.801
- And no more lame jokes, all right?
- Okay.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.499
- Stop that shit.
- Okay.

31:03.561 --> 31:04.801
No subway, no Internet.

31:04.863 --> 31:08.174
- Are you fucking serious, dude?
- I am serious, are you?

31:08.233 --> 31:09.507
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

31:09.567 --> 31:11.012
- No. No worries.
- Not a problem.

31:11.069 --> 31:14.710
- I can... I'll talk to you later.
- We'll talk and I'll... You can call me.

31:14.772 --> 31:18.310
- That was a stupid share, dude.
- Thanks.

31:18.376 --> 31:21.755
I love when people just bring it.

31:21.813 --> 31:24.123
It was... You were, like,
an open wound out there.

31:24.182 --> 31:27.891
It was... Your guts
were flopping out all over the place.

31:27.952 --> 31:28.987
Thanks.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.761
- That was some inspiring shit, yo.
- Yeah.

31:31.823 --> 31:32.824
I'm Dede.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.599
- I know who you are.
- Can I get your number?

31:35.660 --> 31:39.369
My sponsor told me to get numbers, but
I'm not good at that reaching out shit.

31:39.430 --> 31:40.534
It's...

31:41.332 --> 31:43.710
- You ready?
- Yeah. Okay.

31:44.836 --> 31:46.611
- 6-4-6.
- Okay.

31:46.671 --> 31:48.708
- 5-5-5.
- Yeah.

31:48.773 --> 31:52.050
<i>Zero-uno-cuatro-niner.</i>

31:53.111 --> 31:56.558
646-555-0149.

31:57.148 --> 32:00.721
Dude, you're a doorbell. Ding dong.

32:00.785 --> 32:04.597
- I'm gonna call you.
- I'm gonna friggin' answer.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.068
How's it going with the girl?

32:07.125 --> 32:10.572
- Good. We had our first date.
- Nice.

32:10.695 --> 32:12.197
Is she a friend of Bill?

32:12.263 --> 32:16.370
No, she's a civilian. She's
great, she's funny, she's smart.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.573
And you're a shallow prick,
so she must be gorgeous.

32:19.671 --> 32:23.619
No, man, at this point in my sobriety, I
don't even notice the externals of a woman.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.154
Yeah, fuck you, Deepak.

32:25.209 --> 32:27.189
I'm just focused
right in on her heart and soul.

32:27.245 --> 32:28.553
- Yeah, right.
- I swear.

32:28.613 --> 32:29.648
Yeah.

32:29.714 --> 32:32.285
You know if it keeps going well,
you got to tell her, right?

32:32.350 --> 32:33.556
- Yeah.
- Full disclosure.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.393
I'm a little worried about that.

32:35.453 --> 32:38.263
Well, worry is just a
meditation on shit.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.180
Good morning.

33:03.748 --> 33:05.193
Morning.

33:05.583 --> 33:06.789
So...

33:08.786 --> 33:10.197
What the fuck, Danny?

33:10.588 --> 33:12.158
Building you guys a koi pond.

33:12.957 --> 33:14.334
Koi pond?

33:14.625 --> 33:15.695
Yeah.

33:15.760 --> 33:20.505
Thought it would go good with the whole,
you know, Zen vibe you guys got going on.

33:21.466 --> 33:25.243
Just curious, you ever think about
running the idea by someone first?

33:25.303 --> 33:27.977
Like, I don't know,
maybe the guy who owns the backyard?

33:28.606 --> 33:31.086
Well, you know, I wanted
it to be a surprise.

33:31.509 --> 33:32.886
It is.

33:35.079 --> 33:38.151
- So fish go in there?
- Yeah.

33:38.816 --> 33:43.060
- You know, koi, those big orange carp.
- I know what koi are.

33:44.255 --> 33:47.896
So what happens in the winter when
they freeze their little koi nuts off?

33:48.226 --> 33:50.706
No, look, I built one
for a guy in Michigan.

33:50.762 --> 33:53.743
You just poke a hole in the ice.
It's no problem.

33:53.798 --> 33:54.799
You sure about that?

33:56.367 --> 33:59.041
Trust me.
You're gonna love it, Dad.

34:02.640 --> 34:03.983
God.

34:28.599 --> 34:33.480
Yeah, can I get someone to remove
this television from my room, please?

34:34.839 --> 34:38.377
No, it's not broken.
I just don't want it here. Thanks.

34:46.784 --> 34:48.092
Here you go.

34:48.152 --> 34:49.824
- Did you block the...
- Yeah, boss.

34:49.887 --> 34:52.663
You're all good. You're blocked.
So you want to go get dinner?

34:52.723 --> 34:55.329
No, I've got to make a call.

34:58.129 --> 35:00.370
<i>Nice flourish.</i>

35:00.832 --> 35:03.073
Wait, what are you eating?

35:03.267 --> 35:05.645
Just a little healthy
plate of veggies.

35:05.703 --> 35:08.309
<i>- Hold up your plate again.
- What?</i>

35:08.439 --> 35:09.975
I just want to see something.

35:13.311 --> 35:17.589
Look at your cute little plate with
your vegetables all segregated and such.

35:17.648 --> 35:20.891
<i>Yeah, I just don't think that
foods of different color should mix.</i>

35:20.952 --> 35:24.525
Hey, I hear you. Separate
but equal. Plessy v. Ferguson.

35:25.490 --> 35:29.233
God, I really like you.
And I don't like anybody.

35:29.293 --> 35:32.001
I know, right?
I hate everyone except for you.

35:32.063 --> 35:33.235
<i>Me, too.</i>

35:36.167 --> 35:38.613
<i>I thought about you fast night.</i>

35:39.604 --> 35:40.912
Yeah?

35:41.772 --> 35:46.744
Actually, I thought
about you three times.

35:48.913 --> 35:52.986
<i>Have you ever
"thought" about me?</i>

35:58.789 --> 36:00.496
Hold on a second.

36:05.796 --> 36:08.174
<i>Yeah. Hey, come on in.</i>

36:11.102 --> 36:12.604
<i>I unplugged it already.</i>

36:13.604 --> 36:16.414
<i>Okay. Sorry about that.</i>

36:16.474 --> 36:18.579
Where did we leave off?

36:19.911 --> 36:22.619
Are they taking the
TV out of your room?

36:22.680 --> 36:23.988
<i>What?</i>

36:24.048 --> 36:25.584
What are you, Amish?

36:26.150 --> 36:30.724
<i>Yes, and I was hoping to escort you
to a barn raising upon my return.</i>

36:31.889 --> 36:36.360
Oh, my God, seriously, why are
they taking the TV out of your room?

36:39.230 --> 36:41.608
I just can't have it in my room.

36:41.799 --> 36:43.403
<i>And why not?</i>

36:46.003 --> 36:47.448
You...

36:48.239 --> 36:51.118
You know when you don't
have control over something?

36:52.677 --> 36:56.318
<i>No. I have control over
everything in my life.</i>

36:57.014 --> 36:59.494
<i>I'm kidding. I'm sorry.
Go ahead.</i>

37:00.585 --> 37:01.859
Well...

37:08.726 --> 37:09.898
I just...

37:09.961 --> 37:12.874
I can't have any distractions
on these business trips.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.540
Like me?

37:16.000 --> 37:17.843
No. Like TV.

37:22.373 --> 37:24.080
Hey, what's going on?

37:27.311 --> 37:31.555
Owner said my seams suck.
Been sanding this shit for two days.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.554
Welcome to residential construction.

37:34.819 --> 37:36.992
Hey, I'm not complaining though.

37:37.054 --> 37:40.433
I mean, I know
you're taking a flyer on me and all.

37:41.025 --> 37:46.873
No, seriously, I just want to say how much
I appreciate what you're doing for me.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.604
Hey. United, we stand.
Divided, we stagger.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.414
- It's just that...
- Hey, hey, hey.

37:55.473 --> 37:57.214
Ever since I put the liquor down,

37:58.142 --> 38:01.123
the slightest thing makes me start
crying like a little bitch.

38:01.279 --> 38:07.025
I get these feelings
coming up inside of me, you know?

38:08.386 --> 38:09.729
Feelings are like children.

38:09.787 --> 38:13.360
You don't want them driving the car, but you
don't want to stuff them in the trunk, either.

38:14.492 --> 38:15.903
Where do you get this shit?

38:16.961 --> 38:18.235
Meetings.

38:18.629 --> 38:21.735
Lots and lots and lots of meetings.

38:33.678 --> 38:36.784
- Hey, Mom. I'm kind of busy right now.
- That's funny.

38:36.847 --> 38:40.556
I wasn't too busy
to give birth to you 28 years ago.

38:40.851 --> 38:42.296
I'm sorry. How are you?

38:42.353 --> 38:46.392
So Judy Berger's son, Howard,
is doing his premed at Tufts,

38:46.457 --> 38:49.529
<i>and he's thinking about
going into emergency medicine.</i>

38:49.593 --> 38:54.133
<i>So I told her that you would take him around
one day next week, show him the ropes.</i>

38:54.198 --> 38:56.542
- No! I can't.
- Why not?

38:56.600 --> 39:00.412
We're gearing up for our yearly reviews.
It's just a really bad time.

39:00.471 --> 39:03.475
- Yeah, but I promised her. I promised her.
<i>- Hang on, Mom.</i>

39:03.541 --> 39:05.316
<i>- What? Code blue?
- She's counting on...</i>

39:05.376 --> 39:07.982
Get him into trauma room three stat!
I'll be right there!

39:08.045 --> 39:09.615
I gotta go, Mom!

39:48.619 --> 39:50.860
Hold on.

39:50.921 --> 39:52.093
Hey, Neil.

39:52.156 --> 39:54.762
Where have you been, man?
Dude, I'm losing it.

39:54.825 --> 39:55.997
What's happening?

39:56.060 --> 39:59.064
Everything in this goddamn city
makes me want to act out.

39:59.130 --> 40:03.135
- Get to a meeting.
- Yeah, I am, I am. I'm going right now.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.440
Good.

40:04.502 --> 40:06.607
Neil, how are you getting there?

40:21.919 --> 40:23.660
That's good.

40:44.975 --> 40:46.477
Good to see you, brother.

40:58.222 --> 41:00.224
It's looking good.

41:02.326 --> 41:05.830
Can I get you some iced tea?
Hungry?

41:06.230 --> 41:08.005
Yeah. Tea sounds good.

41:08.065 --> 41:09.738
David, what's up?

41:11.702 --> 41:12.703
Oh, shit.

41:14.171 --> 41:16.560
All right. Well, don't
get into it with him.

41:16.586 --> 41:20.886
I'll be right there.
All right. I'm sorry. Okay.

41:21.178 --> 41:23.249
Guy on the job just slipped.
I gotta go.

41:23.314 --> 41:26.420
Come on, you guys are having fun.
Stay and finish.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.464
It's all right, Ma.
If he's gotta go, he's gotta go.

41:28.786 --> 41:31.027
He doesn't have to go.
He wants to go.

41:31.088 --> 41:34.126
Don't make a thing of this, okay?

41:34.191 --> 41:36.831
The guy's having a nervous breakdown.

41:39.096 --> 41:40.939
You wanna go with me?

41:46.003 --> 41:47.311
Chuck!

41:48.506 --> 41:50.816
Put this down.
Put that down! Put that down!

41:50.875 --> 41:53.754
Thinks he can talk to me like that?
Fuck you!

41:53.811 --> 41:57.520
David, I'm sorry. He's off the job.
This is coming out of my pocket.

41:57.581 --> 41:58.685
Yeah, no shit it will.

41:58.749 --> 42:01.161
- You got a new window now, bitch!
- Okay. All right.

42:01.218 --> 42:02.390
- Fuck you!
- Give me a hand here?

42:03.521 --> 42:05.432
Look at me! Stop it!

42:05.589 --> 42:06.897
Stop it!

42:08.092 --> 42:11.130
Hey. Look at me. We're gonna go now.

42:11.595 --> 42:13.233
You okay to go?

42:14.365 --> 42:16.402
You okay to go?

42:16.500 --> 42:17.877
Yeah.

42:20.437 --> 42:22.314
All right, come on.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.115
We're not gonna do anything stupid.
We're gonna walk out of here, okay?

42:25.175 --> 42:26.176
Yeah.

42:26.243 --> 42:29.952
All right? Look at me.
We're gonna do this, all right?

43:16.794 --> 43:18.467
Now he's all right?

43:20.931 --> 43:22.239
Yeah.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.175
Sorry I've been a shitty son, Dad.

43:31.575 --> 43:35.990
Sorry for all the lying
and the stealing...

43:38.415 --> 43:40.292
The worry and all the bullshit.

43:41.785 --> 43:43.389
I don't...

43:45.322 --> 43:48.235
I don't want to disappoint you
anymore, Pop.

43:50.961 --> 43:52.941
I want you to be proud of me.

44:02.706 --> 44:04.014
Hey.

44:04.675 --> 44:06.279
Jesus, you're beautiful.

44:07.311 --> 44:09.222
What time is our reservation?

44:10.114 --> 44:11.855
About a half an hour.

44:12.683 --> 44:14.162
Plenty of time.

44:35.172 --> 44:37.152
Yes, my tits are fake.

44:37.408 --> 44:40.582
That's what happens
when your real ones try to kill you.

44:41.278 --> 44:43.451
Is that what they mean
by a booby prize?

45:06.303 --> 45:09.216
I have been wanting to do that
since the bug party.

45:09.306 --> 45:11.149
Oh, God. Me, too.

45:13.510 --> 45:16.320
I'm really sorry for my brevity.

45:17.347 --> 45:20.817
- It's just been a really long time for me.
- Yeah, right.

45:20.884 --> 45:25.560
A gorgeous, single hetero
with a job in Manhattan?

45:25.656 --> 45:29.069
No, I'm serious.
It's been really long.

45:31.962 --> 45:33.100
Hey.

45:34.665 --> 45:36.372
Will you go with me?

45:36.633 --> 45:38.169
Where?

45:38.235 --> 45:41.239
You know, like, exclusively?
You and me?

45:43.507 --> 45:44.747
Yeah.

45:45.309 --> 45:46.379
Totally.

45:46.443 --> 45:47.615
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:47.678 --> 45:49.555
That's awesome.

45:50.280 --> 45:52.487
No, our reservation.

45:52.549 --> 45:56.622
It's fine. We still
have, like, 28 minutes.

46:55.712 --> 46:57.089
Hey.

47:03.587 --> 47:05.726
Is that a sobriety medallion?

47:18.502 --> 47:19.810
Yeah.

47:23.340 --> 47:25.752
I had been in recovery
for five years.

47:25.809 --> 47:27.049
For what?

47:31.415 --> 47:32.894
Sex addiction.

47:35.118 --> 47:36.392
What?

47:36.720 --> 47:40.668
I'm sorry. I know I should have told you.
I've been meaning to tell you for a long time.

47:40.724 --> 47:42.328
Is that even a thing? Is that like...

47:42.392 --> 47:46.033
Isn't that something that guys just say as
an excuse when they get caught cheating?

47:46.096 --> 47:49.475
No. No. It's not an
excuse, it's a disease.

47:53.237 --> 47:56.980
I don't understand
why you didn't just tell me.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.383
I don't understand.

47:58.442 --> 48:00.752
I told you right away
that I had had cancer.

48:00.811 --> 48:03.815
- Why didn't you tell me?
- it's different. There's a stigma.

48:03.881 --> 48:05.417
There's no stigma to cancer?

48:05.482 --> 48:09.055
Cancer gets you sympathy.
My thing gets you judgment.

48:10.520 --> 48:13.626
Okay, do you remember when on our
first date, when you said to me

48:13.690 --> 48:16.466
that you couldn't date another addict
and you wouldn't date another addict?

48:17.427 --> 48:20.931
So there I am, I'm having a great time
with a woman that I really like,

48:20.998 --> 48:23.501
and I'm thinking, "Fuck!

48:24.334 --> 48:27.907
"I don't want this to be over
before it even gets to be started."

48:29.706 --> 48:30.844
Phoebe, I'm sorry.

48:30.908 --> 48:32.910
I should have told you sooner.
I know I should have.

48:32.976 --> 48:38.517
But I'm telling you now, and I promise you
from now on, it'll be full disclosure, okay?

48:40.918 --> 48:42.420
I just...

48:46.456 --> 48:50.404
I need some time to just
think about all this.

48:54.731 --> 48:56.677
Okay, I understand.

49:02.005 --> 49:03.985
Just get a pen, douchebag.

49:04.808 --> 49:07.812
Just get a fucking pen
and a piece of paper.

49:08.845 --> 49:10.586
Get a pen.

49:11.882 --> 49:13.793
- Get a pen.
- This guy...

49:13.850 --> 49:17.263
Hey, pal! Take it inside, will you?
We're trying to meditate here.

49:17.321 --> 49:19.733
- Yeah? Fuck you!
- What'd you say?

49:19.790 --> 49:22.703
Why don't you come over the fence?
I'll shove that fucking thing up your ass!

49:22.759 --> 49:24.170
Take it inside!

49:33.136 --> 49:34.274
What?

49:34.338 --> 49:39.014
I was just remembering how when you were
a kid, you used to love to wrestle me.

49:39.509 --> 49:40.817
Yeah.

49:40.877 --> 49:43.517
Cute little honey badger
hanging on my leg.

49:45.816 --> 49:48.558
You used to pin me in,
like, one move every damn time.

49:48.618 --> 49:50.620
Yeah, I could probably
still do that.

49:50.687 --> 49:53.531
Maybe... I don't know,
maybe take me two, three moves.

49:53.590 --> 49:55.297
- Yeah? You think so? Two or three?
- You know, I'm...

49:55.359 --> 49:56.963
- Well, I'm getting old. So...
- Yeah.

49:57.027 --> 49:59.098
- I can't do the one anymore.
- Yeah, all right.

50:01.465 --> 50:03.445
You motherfucker!

50:05.435 --> 50:07.381
Shit! You're big!

50:12.709 --> 50:13.710
Shit.

50:13.844 --> 50:15.289
- You okay?
- Fuck.

50:15.412 --> 50:17.358
- You all right?
- My God.

50:21.918 --> 50:23.556
One! Two!

50:23.687 --> 50:25.689
- -Three!
- All right, all right, all right.

50:25.756 --> 50:28.430
Winner and still champion!

50:28.492 --> 50:30.631
You fucking sandbagged me.
That's bullshit.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.571
I'm too fast. I'm too pretty.

50:33.196 --> 50:35.938
All right, that's it. Round two, let's go.
You're going down, old man.

50:36.266 --> 50:38.337
- Come on.
- Shit.

50:38.635 --> 50:40.637
- You got a phone call.
- Yeah.

50:42.572 --> 50:44.074
My sponsee.

50:44.574 --> 50:46.315
Hey, Adam, what's up?

50:48.812 --> 50:51.019
Let me go somewhere I can talk.

50:52.115 --> 50:53.617
Rain check.

50:57.454 --> 51:01.766
It's just all so fucking complicated,
man. I just... I really am feeling

51:01.824 --> 51:05.431
like just grabbing a fuck-it bucket
and going down in a blaze of glory.

51:05.495 --> 51:08.135
- You know what I'm saying?
- Hold on. Hold on.

51:08.432 --> 51:10.036
Listen, Adam.

51:10.167 --> 51:16.277
If I may, you have a slight tendency to
live in the, shall we say, extremes.

51:16.873 --> 51:19.911
Look, life is gonna
throw shit at you.

51:19.976 --> 51:22.479
There's gonna be disappointments,
betrayals,

51:22.612 --> 51:25.684
and I know it hurts
like a back alley colonoscopy.

51:25.749 --> 51:28.628
<i>But look, whether it's this
girl or the next girl,</i>

51:28.952 --> 51:34.197
you need to find someone that accepts
the whole you, warts and all.

51:35.292 --> 51:39.672
Listen, I gave Katie Hep C, and she
stuck it out with my sorry ass.

51:39.796 --> 51:43.039
You really are a lucky son of a bitch.
You do know that, don't you?

51:43.300 --> 51:45.109
I do know that.

51:45.168 --> 51:47.307
And I'm grateful for it every day.

51:47.704 --> 51:49.581
And you will be, too.

52:47.330 --> 52:48.866
Yeah, hello?

52:48.932 --> 52:52.778
Hey, Neil, it's Dede.
I met you the other day at the meeting.

52:53.203 --> 52:56.013
<i>- Yeah. Hey, how...
- Can you talk? Is this a bad time?</i>

52:56.072 --> 53:00.953
No, no. Now's a good time.
What's going on?

53:01.011 --> 53:03.855
My sponsor's not calling me back,
and I'm freaking the fuck out.

53:04.080 --> 53:07.823
Okay, okay. Well, what's happening?

53:07.884 --> 53:10.490
<i>My ex just called.
He wants me to come over.</i>

53:10.554 --> 53:17.563
The guy is a total lying, toxic sack of
shit, but I really wanna go fuck him.

53:17.761 --> 53:22.301
Well, you know, that's maybe not good.
That's not good, I think.

53:22.365 --> 53:24.845
So let's just...

53:24.901 --> 53:27.006
Let's talk this through.

53:27.871 --> 53:30.374
All right, what would happen
if you went over there?

53:30.473 --> 53:32.214
It would be a shit show.

53:32.275 --> 53:35.518
Be specific now.
What would happen?

53:35.845 --> 53:38.451
I'd get inside and he'd attack me.

53:38.515 --> 53:39.892
Right. And after that?

53:39.950 --> 53:41.896
<i>He'd rip my pants off
and start eating me out.</i>

53:41.952 --> 53:43.363
- Wait. What? What?
<i>- 'Cause that's his thing.</i>

53:43.420 --> 53:45.297
I mean, the guy's,
like, a fucking pussy fanatic.

53:45.355 --> 53:46.925
No, after that, skipping ahead.

53:47.090 --> 53:48.501
We'd fuck like animals.

53:48.558 --> 53:51.664
No, I'm talking after all of that,
after you finish.

53:51.728 --> 53:53.298
How would you feel?

53:53.730 --> 53:55.209
You mean, like, emotionally?

53:55.265 --> 53:56.266
Yes.

53:56.800 --> 53:59.303
I'd be all open and
vulnerable and shit,

53:59.369 --> 54:02.179
and he'd be a million miles away,
back with his family.

54:02.672 --> 54:03.810
And then?

54:04.407 --> 54:06.614
Then I'd be so depressed,
I'd call up my guy.

54:06.977 --> 54:07.978
And?

54:08.745 --> 54:10.816
And a half hour later, I'm using.

54:12.816 --> 54:16.093
- See where this goes?
- Yeah.

54:16.152 --> 54:17.290
Good.

54:18.021 --> 54:20.001
But I want to so bad.

54:20.056 --> 54:22.161
No, Dede, don't.
Where are you?

54:23.927 --> 54:25.497
Outside his place.

54:25.562 --> 54:27.564
<i>- What? No!
- I can't help it.</i>

54:27.631 --> 54:29.406
All right. Listen to me, okay?

54:29.466 --> 54:31.742
I want you to turn around
and go someplace safe.

54:31.801 --> 54:33.007
What's near you?

54:33.069 --> 54:34.377
<i>- I don't know.
- Think!</i>

54:34.437 --> 54:37.646
Okay, fuck! The salon where
I work is pretty close.

54:37.707 --> 54:38.742
<i>Where is it?</i>

54:38.808 --> 54:39.912
Tell me!

54:39.976 --> 54:42.752
Damn, dude.
You just got all Jack Bauer on me.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.121
Seriously?

54:52.856 --> 54:55.063
You know what? Forget it.
I'm just gonna get out here.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.435
Thank you. How much?
Yeah. Here you go.

55:38.068 --> 55:41.311
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Dede. Where's Dede?

55:41.371 --> 55:42.748
Do you have an appointment?

55:43.039 --> 55:45.110
Holy shit, Neil.

55:45.442 --> 55:47.513
- I made it.
- Are you okay?

55:47.577 --> 55:50.080
- Lester hands paper.
- What?

55:54.417 --> 55:56.192
You seem better.

55:58.955 --> 56:00.263
Trade ya.

56:00.323 --> 56:04.100
Sorry I went all Linda Blair on you.
Here you go. Thank you.

56:04.361 --> 56:07.342
It's the least I can do.
You saved my ass.

56:07.497 --> 56:09.875
Come on.
I'll give you a shave while you wait.

56:13.269 --> 56:16.478
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

56:16.539 --> 56:19.110
So, what are your, like,
you know, I don't know...

56:19.175 --> 56:20.745
What's your big trigger?

56:20.810 --> 56:22.050
I don't know.

56:22.112 --> 56:26.492
For me, it's, like, when I'm sad,
I wanna have sex...

56:26.549 --> 56:32.295
- So if you...
- Or if I'm happy, or tired, or bored.

56:32.655 --> 56:36.432
- So pretty much just emotions?
- You get the point.

56:36.593 --> 56:40.131
- What about you?
- Me, yeah, you know...

56:40.296 --> 56:44.335
- I'd say my big thing is anxiety.
- Yeah, that's a big one.

56:44.401 --> 56:48.076
Yeah, I'm pretty much anxious all
the time, so it's just, like...

56:48.371 --> 56:50.977
Hey. What are you doing?

56:51.307 --> 56:52.911
Am I making you anxious?

56:52.976 --> 56:55.943
No, seriously, what
the fuck are you doing?

56:55.969 --> 56:56.710
Relax.

56:56.746 --> 56:59.886
I'm about to give you
the best shave of your life.

56:59.949 --> 57:02.657
- Please don't hurt me.
- Don't make me laugh.

57:02.719 --> 57:05.495
You got a weapon to my throat.
Why would I do that?

57:07.223 --> 57:13.174
You know, it's weird, but from the moment
you answered, I started to feel better.

57:14.531 --> 57:15.686
Come on. Don't...

57:15.712 --> 57:18.971
I'm completely serious.
I swear, it's true.

57:21.971 --> 57:27.649
You know, when you called,
I was this close to losing my day count.

57:27.977 --> 57:29.388
Really?

57:31.881 --> 57:34.487
Sounds like we both had a God shot.

57:34.884 --> 57:38.559
Yeah, you know, the whole higher power
thing kind of trips me up a little bit.

57:38.621 --> 57:41.295
I mean, I don't know if I believe it.

57:41.658 --> 57:46.698
You know, my sponsor tells me that it's just
gotta be about something bigger than me,

57:46.763 --> 57:49.676
but I don't know what that means.

57:49.732 --> 57:51.939
Well, don't over-think it.
It could be anything.

57:52.001 --> 57:55.107
It's, like, service, like coming
here right now, helping me.

57:55.171 --> 57:56.445
That's higher power.

58:02.545 --> 58:06.049
You, like, literally
transplanted a baby's butt on my face.

58:06.115 --> 58:09.187
That was so solid of you
to come all this way for me.

58:09.252 --> 58:10.287
Thank you.

58:10.720 --> 58:13.599
God. That's right.
I almost forgot.

58:13.656 --> 58:15.829
I have to get home
without using the subway.

58:16.292 --> 58:17.965
Why don't you just use my bike?

58:18.027 --> 58:21.406
- No, I can't.
- It's okay. I have another one.

58:21.531 --> 58:23.670
No, I mean, I literally can't.

58:24.200 --> 58:27.409
I'm not a good rider of bikes.

58:44.521 --> 58:48.162
- Hey, move your shit, fat girl.
- I'm a guy, asshole!

58:48.558 --> 58:50.595
I'm a fat guy!

58:51.261 --> 58:53.070
Yield, please.

58:53.663 --> 58:55.506
Who lives like this?

59:00.870 --> 59:02.406
Hey, sorry.

59:05.808 --> 59:07.810
Hey. How's it going?

59:08.678 --> 59:11.081
I'm gonna finish this
90 in 90 if it kills me.

59:11.107 --> 59:11.707
Good.

59:11.748 --> 59:15.195
But just remember, one day at a time.

59:15.585 --> 59:17.462
Biking now?

59:18.121 --> 59:20.965
- Can't forget to tuck in the cuff, man.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

59:21.024 --> 59:22.970
- That's a nice helmet you got there.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

59:23.026 --> 59:25.370
- What shade of pink is that again?
- I'm gonna get a new one, okay?

59:25.428 --> 59:27.704
- It matches your shirt.
- Fuck you, dude.

59:27.764 --> 59:30.244
You're the one who told me
I couldn't take the subway anymore,

59:30.300 --> 59:34.544
so now I'm out there in the streets, biking
for my life like fuckin' <i>Il Postino.</i>

59:35.371 --> 59:37.510
Okay. I'm sorry.

59:37.574 --> 59:40.077
- Why are you riding me?
- I'm sorry.

59:40.143 --> 59:42.384
I'm just... I'm going through
some stuff right now.

59:42.946 --> 59:45.426
It's fine. I'm sorry.

59:45.481 --> 59:48.291
I just haven't jerked
off in over a week.

59:48.351 --> 59:50.888
You know, I just feel like
one giant blue ball right now.

59:50.954 --> 59:51.955
Right.

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:05.405
Yo, two after.
Can we do this?

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:16.747
Okay, Adam, I'm gonna need, like, some
specifics here, so that I can understand.

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:20.419
You really wanna look
under that rock?

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:24.595
I mean, if we're gonna do this,
you know, I gotta know.

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:26.957
Oh, God...

01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:32.331
Compulsive masturbation.

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:37.868
Hitting on every girl
that I come across.

01:00:38.868 --> 01:00:41.246
Lots of one-night stands.

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:43.873
Juggling multiple girlfriends.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.380
Prostitutes?

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:48.383
Prostitutes, yeah.

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:52.024
I'm sorry.

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:56.393
- It's hard for me to picture you like that.
- That's it. That's the disease.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:01:02.429
It makes you do things that violate
everything that you believe in.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.301
I wanted to stop so badly,
I can't tell you, but I couldn't.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.901
I understand. I just...

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:14.308
The thing that scares
me, if I'm honest,

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:18.950
is how do you know
you're not gonna fall off the wagon?

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:22.247
All I can say to you is this.

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:26.125
I have been sober for five years.

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:29.220
It is the most important
thing in my life.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:33.259
And I am not planning
to let anything fuck that up.

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:38.964
Okay.

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:48.540
I'm just gonna go in there, pick up
my laundry and tell her my truth.

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.543
Fuckin' A you are.

01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:54.855
<i>- Thanks for bookending this with me, Dede.</i>
- Thanks for letting me be of service.

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:57.454
Now, go tell Mommy
you're a sex addict.

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.231
- Hi.
- Hi, Mom.

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:11.499
- Honey.
- Hey.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.598
What's... Okay.

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:17.267
- Why are you so sweaty?
- I rode my bike here. Can I...

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:20.177
- Since when do you bike?
- Since yesterday...

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.806
Can I come in for a second?
Can we talk about something?

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.852
Yeah, sure. But I just need you
to change one light bulb first.

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:30.514
I mean, why should I even have this
big house if you're never gonna be home?

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.821
Okay, so, Mom, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:34.486
What's going on back here?

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:35.585
What?

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:39.758
All this sweat and schmutz
in your tuchus. What is it?

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:43.235
- It's from the bike seat.
- Well, I can't take it. It's disgusting.

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:44.293
Mom!

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.203
What? You're, like, a
homeless in these pants.

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.070
Okay, can you please just
listen to me for one second?

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:50.907
No. Take them off.
Just take them off.

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:56.709
Okay, take these off.
I'll wash 'em for you.

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:07.885
Okay, so it was one of those things where
you work out, and then you're perspiring,

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.726
and you take a shower,
but not for long enough, apparently.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.528
'Cause I'm giving this presentation,

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:16.092
and I was, like,
schvitzing like a Russian gangster.

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:17.570
It was...

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:19.905
What?

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:21.571
Nothing.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.269
This is nice.

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:30.850
- No PDA?
- No. Yes. Yes, on the PDA.

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:32.250
- Yes?
- Most definitely, yes.

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:34.982
Okay. Well, what about if I do this?

01:03:35.711 --> 01:03:37.213
Yeah, always.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.691
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:43.163
What if I just wanna
kind of upgrade it to, like...

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:44.823
- Yeah.
- Like a TMJ.

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:46.161
Yeah...

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:53.169
What if I... But what if I go like this?
Is that...

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:56.699
- Yeah, do that forever.
- Really?

01:03:56.766 --> 01:04:02.079
Even when I'm an old, stinking man
with claw-like, arthritic claw hands?

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:03.742
Will you love me then?

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.278
Adam.

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:08.117
You're killing me.

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:11.320
Hey.

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:14.294
Becky.

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.587
Yeah, I know.
I remember.

01:04:18.387 --> 01:04:19.491
Oh, my God.

01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:21.865
It's been years. How are you?

01:04:23.392 --> 01:04:25.804
Do you still have
that great apartment downtown?

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:28.993
Yep. Still in the same place.
This is Phoebe.

01:04:29.019 --> 01:04:29.801
Hello.

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:35.009
- Have you seen his place?
- Yes, I have, and it is great.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:41.046
Great. Good.
Good seeing you, Becky.

01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.660
"Hint, hint, Becky, leave now."

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:55.234
It's nice to see you, too, Adam.

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:07.505
Here we are.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:10.574
Make yourself at home.
I'm gonna go change.

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:29.662
Hey, baby.

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:34.140
You want a dance?

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:55.589
Yeah.

01:05:59.822 --> 01:06:01.460
Hey, let's ease...

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:04.301
Just kiss me, okay?

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:06.370
You know the rules.

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:08.074
No touching.

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:20.247
Hey.

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:23.122
What's wrong?

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:28.023
Listen, I...

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:32.324
This is taking me to places
where I've been in the past,

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:34.891
where I just don't
wanna go right now.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.464
I'm sorry.

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:42.669
It's all right. I know you...
I mean, you gotta be careful, I get that.

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:45.736
But, I mean, aren't we allowed
to be a little playful?

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:47.144
Absolutely.

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:52.911
Adam, I am a very sexual person,

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:56.548
and I'm gonna need to be able to
express that side of myself with you.

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:58.922
And I want you to, believe me.

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:02.485
I just would like to take it
a little bit more slowly.

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:05.063
Did Becky go slow?

01:07:58.774 --> 01:08:00.219
Oh, shit!

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:04.251
- Yeah, it's looking good.
- Yeah.

01:08:04.313 --> 01:08:06.884
Yeah, there it goes. Finish it up.

01:08:06.982 --> 01:08:11.522
Hey, so you really want me there?
I mean, I can find somewhere else...

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:12.691
No, I want you to meet Adam.

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.792
He's a good guy.
He's got a good head. He's smart.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:17.131
Smart? Like, I'm gonna
need a thesaurus to...

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:20.697
No, I'm just saying that
he's been through some hard times,

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.640
- and now he's doing great.
- Hard times.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.734
And he's bringing his new lady friend over.
You'll like him.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.837
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I get it. Positive role model.

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:32.352
Jesus, Danny, it's just dinner.
Just show up and eat the food.

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:35.654
God, this house is amazing.

01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:39.215
I love all the woodwork and stuff.
It's so beautiful.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:44.595
- When was the house built?
- 1898.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:47.390
I've been renovating it since then.

01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:54.167
You've done a really great job.
It's very homey. It's nice.

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:56.437
- We like it.
- Thank you.

01:08:59.268 --> 01:09:03.876
You know, let's start. It's, you
know, family style. Here we go.

01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:09.385
That's... No, that's way too much for me.
Here, babe, let's...

01:09:09.444 --> 01:09:14.053
- How much do you want?
- I'll just serve myself, it's fine. I just...

01:09:21.055 --> 01:09:22.466
What are you, a smurf?

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:25.828
Here we go.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:30.571
First off, you could not
pay me enough to do a triathlon.

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.305
Secondly, and furthermore,

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:36.506
I cannot believe you are voluntarily going
to swim in the Hudson fuckin' River.

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:39.984
- Mike.
- What? Honey, she's a big girl.

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:44.354
- Sorry about the language.
- That's okay. I accept your fucking apology.

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:48.658
Now you owe me an apology.

01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:52.964
Sorry I'm late. There was
an accident on the BQE.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:56.660
- The food was getting cold, so we started.
- I'll make you a plate.

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:58.261
That's all right.

01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:01.701
Don't worry about it.
I'm not hungry anyway.

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:10.842
So Adam told me that you guys
were high school sweethearts.

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:12.146
Yeah.

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:14.447
God, we were stupid.

01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:18.352
What?

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:20.690
I was just thinking about
what my life would've been like

01:10:20.749 --> 01:10:23.025
if I had married my
high school sweetheart.

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:24.564
Scary, huh?

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:27.194
Horror movie scary.

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:33.205
Yeah, Mike and I, we just got lucky.

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:35.733
Lucky's good.

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:38.744
Well, you may be getting lucky.

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:42.312
Adam is a good guy.

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:46.882
Yeah, he is.

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:54.184
Hey.

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:57.456
What's wrong?

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:06.901
I just think I'm worried about
this whole addict thing, you know?

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:09.370
I mean, I just...

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:13.406
Do you ever worry
that you'll be just humming along,

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:17.076
and then he's just gonna
veer off back into the darkness?

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.083
In my experience,

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:25.082
the only way that I can do this
is just to keep the focus on myself.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.056
Meaning?

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:30.127
Meaning...

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.131
What about my side of the street?

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:36.135
What are my issues that
I have to deal with?

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:40.470
After all, I picked an addict,
that says something.

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:49.639
Yeah, so, I mean, it's pretty
much self-sustaining, you know?

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:54.120
The fish, they do their thing
in the water, and that...

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:56.952
Yeah, and then the phytoplankton
eat the fish's waste,

01:11:57.012 --> 01:12:00.255
and then they create oxygen,
which the fish use,

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:01.920
so it's, like, a closed loop, right?

01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:04.898
Yeah. Exactly.

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:07.560
Adam's an environmental wizard.

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:09.434
Is that right?

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.937
You know, I had a cell mate once
who thought he was a warlock.

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:14.438
So...

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.769
So nice job on the girl.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.205
- I like her a lot.
- Yeah.

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:24.507
I really like her.
I think this might have legs.

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:27.244
Hey, listen, if it works out,
no one will be happier than me.

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:29.846
And if you don't make me the best man,
I will fuck up your wedding.

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:32.252
Mike, you're the best, man.

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:34.620
What are you saying?
I'm the best man, or I'm, like...

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:36.458
You're the best...

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:37.954
Man.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.728
That's not a committal.
You're not committing.

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:42.359
- I will fuck up your wedding.
- You're the best man.

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:44.734
- I will fall into the wedding cake.
- You are the best, man.

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:47.467
I will be the one
that will not forever hold his peace.

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.438
Hey.

01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:52.940
You think I could be your best man
when you two get married?

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:57.917
Nothing? All right.

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:17.097
A lot of smells going on in here.
You getting that?

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:21.201
It's like patchouli mixed
with BO and hugs.

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.833
Hey, Judgie Judgerstein,
I'm glad you could make it.

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:26.903
You know, I'm not really a
dancer so much as a walker.

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:30.507
- You gotta let your spontanuity go.
- I don't think that's actually a word.

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:31.949
Relax.

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:34.782
Ecstatic dancing is not
about looking good.

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:37.649
It's about getting in touch
with your higher power.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:40.852
You're gonna make me find this higher
power even if it kills ya, huh?

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:43.954
Relax, babe.
Let your inhibitions run wild.

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:46.226
I don't think inhibitions can...

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.585
I like that Phoebe, babe.

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:19.427
And I like her for him.
I think they could make it.

01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:22.430
What do you think?

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:24.737
I'm not so sure.

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:30.232
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know. I'm just not so sure.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.869
Are you kidding me?

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:33.538
You didn't see
how they were looking at each other?

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:38.745
That's the same kind of look we used to
give each other, like, 30 years ago.

01:14:40.742 --> 01:14:42.415
Have you seen my pain pills?

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:44.914
They're not in the cabinet?

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.789
No. Weird.

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:51.859
I don't fuckin' believe it.

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:54.831
Mike, you don't know that.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:03.208
Gotta tell you, Mike
really liked you.

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:05.174
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:08.939
Believe me, he's a hard sell.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.242
I'm glad I passed the test.

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:15.148
Come on, I didn't mean it like that.

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:17.550
What's the matter?

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:20.457
Nothing.
I'm just cranky. I missed my run.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.325
I know that's your drug.

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:24.589
What? Nothing.

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.867
I know another way
to get endorphins going.

01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:32.201
God, I'm about to crash.

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:35.765
I have a 7:30 breakfast.

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:41.504
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:45.548
You don't have to promise me sex.

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:24.608
Sounds like you had
a really good time.

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:30.748
You know, I don't know
if I could approve

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:36.228
of you grinding up against
a bunch of sweaty undulating bodies.

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:39.862
No, no, no, I'm in for the night.

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:46.198
Maybe I could get away
for a few minutes tomorrow at lunch.

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:48.465
Sounds like fun.

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:51.770
Okay, good. Good night.

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:54.743
Hey. Did I wake you up?

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:58.847
Who was that?
Who are you talking to?

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:00.250
What?

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:02.879
- Who are you on the phone with?
- My sponsee.

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:06.587
Really? At 2:00 in the morning?

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:09.162
Yeah, he was calling to check in.

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:14.091
Can I see your phone?

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:15.928
Are you serious?

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:20.997
- You don't want me to see your phone?
- No, and I resent you asking me to see it.

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:23.576
Which makes me think
that you're hiding something.

01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:24.838
You know what, Phoebe?

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.777
This isn't gonna work
without a little bit of trust.

01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:30.340
- Let me see your phone.
- No.

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:31.849
- Give me your phone.
- No.

01:18:31.907 --> 01:18:33.215
- Just give me your phone.
- I'm not letting you...

01:18:33.275 --> 01:18:34.948
Just give me the fuckin' phone.

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:42.523
Happy?

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:49.067
- What's going on with you?
- What's going on with you, Adam?

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:50.535
What is going on?

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:54.001
I feel like you're starting
to pull away from me.

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:55.900
I mean, am I crazy?

01:18:58.033 --> 01:18:59.876
Yeah, you're right, I know.

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:03.681
So are you gonna
talk to me about it?

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:06.211
Yeah.

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:11.691
I guess, you know...

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:17.597
For me, for so long,
you know,

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:24.727
sex was, like, this secretive
chase for a fix, right?

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:27.532
And now, with us,

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:31.144
it's really hard for
me to connect that

01:19:31.199 --> 01:19:35.477
to something that's
loving and intimate and real.

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:37.483
And it's not you.

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.048
What?

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:42.651
- What?
- I just don't...

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:45.216
I don't know if I can do this.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.055
Why? Why not? What do you mean?

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:49.354
We can do it.
We just have to do the work.

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:51.761
Do the work? Adam, we just met.

01:19:51.887 --> 01:19:56.427
I mean, this is crazy.
We should be in the honeymoon phase.

01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:58.471
What do you mean honeymoon?
Where do you get that from?

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:00.564
What, did you read that in a book?

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:05.538
I think that I might...

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:10.945
- What?
- Need someone who's healthier.

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.815
- Healthier?
- Or not healthier, but...

01:20:12.874 --> 01:20:16.321
No. Because I'm sick,
and you, you're healthy

01:20:16.378 --> 01:20:21.123
with your compulsive exercising
and your crazy fucking food bullshit?

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:25.155
I think you're a really
great guy, Adam.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:28.951
No, you think that I'm a sick 
piece of shit. But don't worry.

01:20:28.977 --> 01:20:30.661
You, you're perfect, right?

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:52.481
What's up?

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:54.623
Honey, sit down.

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:57.258
What happened?

01:20:58.453 --> 01:21:00.296
Did you take your mom's pain pills?

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:04.103
- Did I what?
- Simple question.

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:07.436
Did you go into our bathroom
and steal your mother's pills?

01:21:08.129 --> 01:21:10.040
No. I told you guys, I'm clean.

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:13.341
Then what happened?
Did they just sprout wings and fly away?

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:14.675
Mike, come on.

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:18.607
I'm never gonna be anything
but a fuck-up to you, am I?

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:20.710
Honey, we won't be mad.

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:24.080
Give us the goddamn pills.

01:21:24.145 --> 01:21:25.556
What pills?

01:21:25.614 --> 01:21:28.458
You mean the pills she has to take
'cause of what you gave her?

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:30.359
- Those pills?
- You watch your tone.

01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:32.193
What tone, huh? The
tone I learned from you

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:35.030
when you used to come into my room
at night with your fuckin' Jameson's breath

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:36.967
- and smack me around? That tone?
- What are you talking about?

01:21:37.025 --> 01:21:38.470
- Right, Ma?
- What are you talking about?

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:39.766
Say something!

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:41.271
Yeah, take his side
like you always fuckin' did.

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:43.434
- Stop talking ancient history!
- That always fuckin' worked.

01:21:43.498 --> 01:21:46.741
- We're talking about right now.
- Good. Fine. Right now, I want an apology.

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:48.041
- You want an apology?
- Yeah.

01:21:48.103 --> 01:21:51.141
You got some fuckin' stones, kid.
Apology for what?

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:53.413
For accusing me
of something I didn't fuckin' do!

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:55.421
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

01:21:56.444 --> 01:21:59.914
That's right, 'cause that would mean
admitting that you're wrong, wouldn't it?

01:21:59.981 --> 01:22:01.289
Big Mike's never wrong.

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:04.796
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you, Mr. 12-Step.

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:06.730
You can go pretend that
you're Mr. Recovery

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:10.098
to all your sponsees who think
you're Jesus fucking Christ.

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:11.761
Guess what, Dad?

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:14.932
I know the truth about you.
You were a monster then.

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:18.637
You're a goddamn hypocrite now,
telling them to go make amends.

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.873
You've never even
made amends to your own son

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.542
for all the shit that you did to me,
all the shit that you put me through.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:24.845
Yes, I did, I did.

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:27.216
You did? When did you ever
make an amends to me?

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:28.879
- When?

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:32.854
That's right, never.
You never did. You can start right now.

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:36.588
- Dad, say you're sorry to me.
- I'm not saying I'm sorry to you.

01:22:37.385 --> 01:22:40.423
- Say you're sorry to me.
- I am not saying I'm sorry to you.

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:43.332
- Say you're fucking sorry to me!
- I am not saying I'm sorry to you!

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:45.735
That's right, 'cause you're
a fuckin' coward!

01:22:49.998 --> 01:22:51.443
Stop it!

01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:56.711
Stop it! Stop it!

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:16.218
Hey, Mike, it's Adam.

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:20.323
Yeah, I'm in DC
for this postal service meeting,

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:24.560
and I'm not doing so good, man.

01:24:24.826 --> 01:24:26.828
Yeah, it's over with Phoebe.

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:30.502
And I'm having some really
dark thoughts here, brother.

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:33.469
So, can you give me a call
when you get this, please?

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:35.071
Okay, thanks, man. Bye.

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:39.243
Come on, come on.

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:42.154
Hey, Margo. Hey, it's Adam.

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:43.780
How you doing?

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:45.051
I'm great.

01:24:45.113 --> 01:24:49.323
Hey, listen. Do you think I could
swing by there and grab the computer?

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:51.921
There's a couple edits
I wanna make on the...

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:57.897
You know what? I'm fine. Let's just...
We'll bang it out in the morning.

01:24:57.959 --> 01:24:59.996
Okay, good night. Thanks, bye.

01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:02.537
Fucking idiot.

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:35.000
Yeah.

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:38.210
Yeah.

01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:22.414
Adam?

01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:32.556
Yeah, slow.

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:34.628
Yeah, slow.

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:58.388
- Hey.
- Hi, baby.

01:26:58.479 --> 01:27:00.982
I am so happy to see you.

01:27:01.182 --> 01:27:03.719
Thanks for coming.
I was seriously bugging out.

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:06.924
Jesus. There's more
shit than air in here.

01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:08.190
Yeah, I know.

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:11.634
You gotta do something about this, dude.
This is not conclusive to your sobriety.

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:14.105
- I think you mean conducive.
- You got any garbage bags?

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:17.237
Yes. Yes, I do. Hang on.

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:29.248
Dude, explain this to me.

01:27:29.644 --> 01:27:32.454
You're trying to stay sober and you
still have your porn collection?

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:36.427
Yeah, I'm really just stashing it up here.
I don't actually watch any of it anymore.

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:38.861
- We need to get rid of this.
- I know.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.059
No. We need to get rid of this now.

01:28:01.342 --> 01:28:03.151
You okay with this?

01:28:03.745 --> 01:28:06.021
It's like burying an old friend.

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:20.803
<i>Burning porn, My Lord</i>

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.836
<i>Kumbaya</i>

01:28:22.897 --> 01:28:24.137
Really?

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:26.374
<i>Neil's shit's burning, My Lord</i>

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:27.708
Okay.

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.843
<i>Kumbaya</i>

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:36.384
<i>How am I gonna jack
off now, My Lord?</i>

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:39.149
<i>Kumbaya</i>

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:44.291
<i>Oh, Lord, Kumbaya</i>

01:28:45.586 --> 01:28:47.463
You were a little high.

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:51.435
What's wrong?

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:57.041
I've never been just friends
with a guy before.

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:58.472
It's so...

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.279
What?

01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:02.876
Hot.

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:08.945
I love you, big man.

01:29:09.477 --> 01:29:12.253
I love you, too, small
tattooed woman.

01:29:41.409 --> 01:29:42.945
I fucked up.

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:58.766
You always have to be right,
don't you, Mike?

01:29:58.826 --> 01:30:00.999
- Always.
- Really? You gonna start this?

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:02.735
Just get out.

01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:11.246
Fuck it. I'm gonna go.

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.790
Danny, come on, call us.

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:21.217
Your mom is worried.

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:24.723
Really? Really?

01:31:01.255 --> 01:31:02.734
Hey, it's Adam.

01:31:03.624 --> 01:31:05.433
You wanna come by?

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:23.022
Give me a five scratches.

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:31.694
3 Musketeers bar.

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.391
Is that it?

01:31:38.759 --> 01:31:40.636
Yeah. Let me have...

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:45.704
A bottle of bourbon,
fifth of bourbon.

01:31:46.734 --> 01:31:47.906
Yeah.

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.437
Hey.

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:17.041
What happened?

01:32:17.265 --> 01:32:18.505
Where is he?

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:20.170
Katie, breathe.

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:37.653
<i>And then at the last minute, this guy just,
like, jumps in front of me and takes my cab.</i>

01:32:37.718 --> 01:32:38.788
<i>I go down to the subway.</i>

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:40.799
<i>I'm waiting for the subway for,
like, 20 minutes.</i>

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:45.167
<i>I get on, and after two stops, they stop it,
and they say it's 'cause of a sick passenger.</i>

01:32:45.226 --> 01:32:48.833
Like, how much of a diva do you
have to be to stop a whole train?

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:51.103
The gumption, it's crazy.

01:32:51.766 --> 01:32:54.406
I remember this place.

01:32:54.969 --> 01:32:57.347
Oh, my God. I love this rug.

01:32:57.872 --> 01:32:59.852
Are you sure you're not gay?

01:33:00.508 --> 01:33:01.953
Pretty sure.

01:33:03.511 --> 01:33:05.616
Okay.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.818
Give it a second.

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:09.885
- You're so fucking hot.
- Thank you.

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:12.264
Time out.

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.856
Why don't you
make me a drink or something?

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:17.926
Of course. I'm sorry. How rude of me.
What would the lady like?

01:33:17.992 --> 01:33:22.065
The lady would like a glass of red
wine if the gentleman has one.

01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:23.767
The lady's in luck.

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:30.709
I was so surprised
when you called me.

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:33.976
It's been a very long time.

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:36.043
I'm glad you picked up.

01:33:38.412 --> 01:33:41.393
So what was the deal
with that girl?

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:43.156
Is she your girlfriend?

01:33:43.217 --> 01:33:45.561
Yeah, that's pretty much over.

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:50.101
Well, I'm glad you called.

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:55.198
Gives me an excuse to wear this
brand-new little dress I bought.

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:56.934
I know.

01:33:58.232 --> 01:34:00.473
Yeah, I love this dress.

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:02.243
Yeah.

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:05.481
You don't think it's too short?

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:07.452
Not at all.

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:09.617
Really?

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:15.988
You don't think it's,
like, a little naughty?

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:18.953
I don't know.

01:34:21.389 --> 01:34:22.697
I do.

01:34:25.459 --> 01:34:30.340
I don't think I should be allowed
to go out like this, right?

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:35.339
No, you shouldn't.

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:37.110
Go on.

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:38.616
Go change your dress.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.815
But I don't wanna change.

01:34:41.776 --> 01:34:45.588
Becky, did you hear me?
I told you to go change, now.

01:34:45.646 --> 01:34:48.252
- Or what?
- Becky, I said change your dress.

01:34:48.315 --> 01:34:49.851
Fuck you. I'm not a child anymore.

01:34:49.917 --> 01:34:53.091
Hey, this is my house.
You're ruled by my rules.

01:34:53.154 --> 01:34:55.225
Daddy, stop it! You're hurting me.

01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:57.769
Becky, you gonna change your dress?

01:34:57.825 --> 01:34:58.929
No.

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:02.670
You wanna be a big girl?
Fine. I'll treat you like a big girl.

01:35:03.564 --> 01:35:05.601
- No, Daddy!
- Yeah.

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:07.577
- What are you doing? Stop.
- Yeah.

01:35:07.635 --> 01:35:09.444
You want me to stop, huh?

01:35:09.503 --> 01:35:13.110
Just say it. I'll stop.
Go ahead, tell me to stop.

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:16.920
Fuck me.

01:35:27.988 --> 01:35:29.331
Yeah.

01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:31.594
Okay, now.

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:35.797
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:38.002
Come on, slap me.

01:35:39.333 --> 01:35:41.244
I'm not gonna slap you.

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:44.544
- Fuckin' slap me.
- I said I'm not gonna slap you.

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:46.050
Come on, fuckin' slap me,
you fucking pussy.

01:35:46.107 --> 01:35:48.451
I'm not into that.
I'm not into that.

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:50.918
Okay?

01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:52.418
Becky.

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.824
- Fuckin' slap me. Come on!
- Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:56.418
- You know you want to. Fuckin' slap me!
- Hey, hey.

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:58.020
- Come on, fuckin' slap me!
- Hey!

01:35:58.085 --> 01:36:00.929
Fuckin' slap me!
Come on, fuckin' slap me!

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:02.399
- Listen to me.
- Fuckin' slap me!

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:03.764
- Stop it.
- Fuckin' slap me!

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:05.428
- Hey, hey.
- Fuckin' slap me!

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:07.097
Stop, stop.

01:36:08.462 --> 01:36:09.770
Stop.

01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:15.376
Stop.

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:20.317
It's okay.

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:22.048
All right?

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:24.089
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:36:25.146 --> 01:36:26.887
- Come on, talk to me.
- Don't touch me!

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:34.065
- Hey, I...
- Don't fucking touch me!

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:43.435
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

01:36:45.366 --> 01:36:46.936
Jesus Christ.

01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:48.173
Becky?

01:36:49.403 --> 01:36:50.711
Hey, Becky.

01:36:54.508 --> 01:36:57.546
It's all right. It's okay.
It's okay.

01:36:57.945 --> 01:37:00.619
Get away from me!

01:37:07.655 --> 01:37:08.861
What?

01:37:09.256 --> 01:37:11.497
Becky, hey.

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:13.571
Becky, come on.

01:37:13.627 --> 01:37:15.368
Get away from me!

01:37:15.429 --> 01:37:19.275
Open the door, okay?
Come on. Come on out of there.

01:37:20.134 --> 01:37:21.579
Fuck.

01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:23.637
Hey, come on.
Talk to me.

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:26.282
Get away from me!

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:30.550
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing in there?
What are you doing in there?

01:37:30.611 --> 01:37:32.113
Hey, hey!

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:36.158
You know what? Becky, 
this isn't funny. Come on now.

01:37:38.919 --> 01:37:41.627
I can't take it.

01:37:45.192 --> 01:37:50.266
Mike, I need your help.
Call me ASAP, man, seriously.

01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:03.253
Dude, where have you been?
I've been trying to call you.

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:06.452
Who?

01:38:07.414 --> 01:38:08.757
What girl?

01:38:10.618 --> 01:38:12.620
All right. Text me
your address. I'm on my way.

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:18.397
No!

01:38:19.493 --> 01:38:21.370
Fuckin' animals!

01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:24.604
You see who did this?

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:26.367
Fuck!

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:14.617
- Dude.
- Hey.

01:39:14.682 --> 01:39:15.717
Where is she?

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:19.424
Right here, in the bathroom.
She's right there on the left.

01:39:19.553 --> 01:39:20.657
- Hey...
- Becky.

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:23.292
Becky, listen. My name is Neil.
I'm friends with Adam.

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:25.268
We're worried about you, sweetie.
How about you open the door?

01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:30.307
Becky! Hey!

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:32.772
Becky!

01:39:32.967 --> 01:39:35.311
- Adam, move!
- Shit!

01:39:38.572 --> 01:39:39.915
- Becky. Come on.
- No.

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:41.247
Talk to me, sweetie.

01:39:42.343 --> 01:39:44.721
Come on. You talk to me here.

01:39:44.778 --> 01:39:45.848
Call 9-1-1.

01:39:47.414 --> 01:39:48.950
Adam, 9-1-1!

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:59.728
Yeah, we need an ambulance quick
at 135 West 3rd Street, apartment 2B.

01:39:59.793 --> 01:40:02.171
Young female,
polysubstance overdose.

01:40:02.363 --> 01:40:06.436
- Did you get that? Okay. Please hurry.
- Stay with me, Becky.

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:09.175
Oh, man.

01:40:09.803 --> 01:40:12.113
Dude, it's all right.
She's gonna be okay.

01:40:20.547 --> 01:40:24.324
Dude, you really are
Anthony Edwards.

01:40:25.552 --> 01:40:27.122
Fuck that.

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:29.162
I'm George Clooney.

01:40:35.295 --> 01:40:39.334
We're looking for our son, Danny Burns.
We've heard he's on the fifth floor.

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:47.352
Baby.

01:40:55.315 --> 01:40:56.919
Are you okay?

01:40:57.017 --> 01:41:00.055
Yeah, I'm fine, Ma.
Are you all right?

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.622
Yeah, I'm...

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:03.827
Are you in pain?

01:41:04.124 --> 01:41:05.432
No.

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:08.634
They got me on the good stuff.

01:41:11.331 --> 01:41:13.436
I didn't even have to steal it.

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:18.411
We know that you
didn't take the pills.

01:41:19.406 --> 01:41:21.181
Right, Mike?

01:41:23.143 --> 01:41:24.952
Will you tell him?

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:28.554
Fuckin' hysterical.

01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:33.498
First drink or drug in
eight months.

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:36.530
I total the car.
I get arrested for DUI.

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:42.570
You must be fuckin' loving this.

01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:46.074
Look at you.

01:41:47.634 --> 01:41:49.580
What's on your mind, Pop?

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:53.680
Why don't you tell me?

01:41:54.341 --> 01:41:57.447
Tell me this is what I get
for white-knuckling it.

01:42:12.059 --> 01:42:13.561
I'm sorry.

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:16.500
I'm so sorry.

01:42:18.298 --> 01:42:19.971
I'm sorry.

01:42:53.167 --> 01:42:56.148
Thanks for meeting me.
It's really good to see you.

01:42:56.203 --> 01:42:57.773
Yeah, you, too.

01:42:57.938 --> 01:43:03.320
I thought a lot about what happened,
and I wanted to clear the air between us.

01:43:07.781 --> 01:43:12.491
I just wanna say that I really regret some
of the things I said to you that night.

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:15.532
I'm sorry.

01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:17.533
I'm not.

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:20.363
It was good. I...

01:43:20.427 --> 01:43:23.704
You forced me to look at myself.
I needed to hear it.

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:26.403
How'd that go?

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:29.404
Not so good, yeah.

01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:32.583
Turns out, I'm not perfect.

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:36.019
No, but you're pretty
fuckin' awesome.

01:43:39.446 --> 01:43:42.620
Oh, God. It's not fair, you know?

01:43:43.283 --> 01:43:44.728
What?

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:48.860
I still hate everybody but you.

01:44:11.612 --> 01:44:15.992
I'm gonna ask you to sit
and listen to me for one second.

01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:20.425
Things are going to
change between us.

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:26.033
From now on, I'm going to be a son.

01:44:27.127 --> 01:44:31.371
I should do something for myself
to show that I love myself.

01:44:31.732 --> 01:44:36.203
Give me the most damaged guy you could
find and I was, like, in heaven.

01:44:36.603 --> 01:44:39.846
I'm halfway through
my ninth step list.

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:42.113
Just did my first wife.

01:44:42.175 --> 01:44:43.745
That was fun.

01:44:44.611 --> 01:44:47.251
I miss acting out.

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:49.953
I do, I'm serious.

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:53.221
This disease won't let
me take a compliment

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:59.393
unless it comes from, like, I don't 
know, a muscley, tattooed Latino man.

01:44:59.626 --> 01:45:03.506
My wife would ask where I was, and I
would say I was at meetings at work,

01:45:03.563 --> 01:45:05.634
and I led a double
life for a long time.

01:45:05.932 --> 01:45:07.434
There are keep-coming-back chips

01:45:07.501 --> 01:45:11.415
for newcomers and members wishing to
reaffirm their commitment to sobriety.

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:14.778
Is anyone celebrating 30 days?

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:54.719
You're welcome.
