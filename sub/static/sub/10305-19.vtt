WEBVTT

00:09.800 --> 00:10.869
Okay.

00:11.080 --> 00:14.197
Somebody broke
into my piggy bank again.

00:14.640 --> 00:18.553
The long strand of red hair...

00:19.080 --> 00:20.752
...and these bonbon wrappers...

00:20.960 --> 00:25.351
...clearly indicate that you, Mother,
saw who did it.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.109
Now, who was it?

00:29.320 --> 00:32.470
Oh, gee, honey, I really don't know.

00:32.680 --> 00:34.875
Hey, look at
this lovely Don Knotts hologram...

00:35.080 --> 00:36.479
<i>...I got from QVC.</i>

00:36.680 --> 00:38.671
Don't try to distract me, Mom.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.792
It's shiny.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.398
Mr. Furley.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.511
Barney Fife.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.399
Furley...

00:50.600 --> 00:51.999
...Fife. Did you see that?

00:52.720 --> 00:54.153
Peg?

01:02.560 --> 01:04.516
I hope one of these bills is
for a coffin...

01:04.720 --> 01:07.712
...because your shopping is
killing me.

01:11.880 --> 01:13.632
Something shiny.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.189
- I got you one, Al.
- I'm not interested in that...

01:17.440 --> 01:18.873
...Pe-

01:21.000 --> 01:22.558
Ginger.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.432
Mary Ann.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.949
Ginger.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.276
Oh, cut this out.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.630
<i>Not only is this QVC thing useless...</i>

01:30.840 --> 01:34.515
...but you've bought a membership
to the Buff and Tuff Health Club.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.030
Well, how else am I supposed
to stay young and attractive for you?

01:38.240 --> 01:39.753
Buy a time machine.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.834
Peg, I'm cutting off your shopping
cold turkey.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.792
Right now.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.592
Traitor.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.950
Oh, Al, don't make me stop shopping.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.912
You'll destroy my life.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.190
Good, then we'll be even.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.560 --> 02:42.391
Yeah, I like this one
even better than...

02:42.600 --> 02:45.398
...that clog cabin we built last week.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.229
It is stunning.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.953
We ought to go into business.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.878
Oh, what business would that be,
Griff?

02:53.080 --> 02:56.197
The shoe box lid
house-building business?

02:56.840 --> 02:59.638
- Not much demand for that.
- Well, I beg to differ.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.593
I think you're overlooking
the homeless dwarf problem.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.513
Now, somebody has got
to clean that up.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.239
Hey, guys.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.799
Hey.

03:21.360 --> 03:26.195
Well, Jefferson, I see you're having
your typically hard day at the office.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.834
You know, looking this good is
a full-time job.

03:29.040 --> 03:32.669
You think these pores
just exfoliate themselves?

03:33.520 --> 03:34.953
You better watch out, Jefferson.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.037
Now you're heading
for the big 4-0...

03:37.240 --> 03:40.550
...Marcie might trade you in
for a new model.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.672
Yeah, when you hit 40,
everything starts going to hell.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.678
Your alignment gets all out of whack...

03:46.880 --> 03:49.394
...then your tyre start
to get a little bald and then...

03:49.960 --> 03:51.996
...comes that horrible day
when you realise...

03:52.200 --> 03:54.077
...no matter how hard you turn
that knob...

03:54.280 --> 03:56.669
...that antenna
is only coming half way up.

04:00.480 --> 04:04.234
Then you start getting
that uncontrollable backfiring.

04:06.880 --> 04:10.429
Well, don't tell me you don't have
that problem!

04:10.760 --> 04:13.877
Well, that may hold true
for you old clunkers...

04:14.080 --> 04:17.231
...but I look the same today
as I did 20 years ago.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.000
I've been looking for you forever.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.914
And I hope I was worth the wait.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.992
Sorry, sir,
I thought you were my dad.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.955
Hey, hey.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.595
Happy birthday, Mr. D'Arcy,
happy birthday.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.394
Oh, sure, rub it in, you brats.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.914
Gee, old man D'Arcy is getting
pretty cranky, huh?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.439
Dad, guess what?

04:48.640 --> 04:51.313
Gary hired us to shoot a commercial
for the store.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.078
Well, why would she hire you two?

04:53.280 --> 04:56.352
Well, because she wanted somebody
fast and cheap.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.110
Which explains our actress.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.837
I, on the other hand, will be directing.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.110
It will be 30 seconds of pure magic.

05:06.320 --> 05:09.835
Oh, now, Bud, don't waste
your best pick-up lines on dad.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.196
We've got the setting.
We've got the customer.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.914
Now, all we need is
a shoe salesman.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.633
Well, how much does it pay?

05:17.840 --> 05:19.398
Four hundred dollars a day.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.397
Earth days?

05:22.520 --> 05:26.308
Hey, I'm your man for the job.
Nobody sells shoes better than me.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.071
Bud, did I ever mention to you
that I played Dorothy...

05:30.280 --> 05:32.669
<i>...in my high school production
of The Wiz?</i>

05:33.800 --> 05:35.950
- All-male school?
- No.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.439
You want to see great acting?

05:39.640 --> 05:42.552
How about those seizures
I used to throw at IHOP?

05:44.400 --> 05:45.992
All right, Dad, so you scammed us...

05:46.200 --> 05:48.919
...a few Rooty Tooty
Fresh 'N Fruity breakfasts.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.475
It doesn't exactly make you
Oscar material.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.716
Hey, you didn't seem to mind
my performance...

05:53.920 --> 05:56.559
...when you were shoving pancakes
in your pockets.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.554
I'm really good.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.830
<i>Hoover High School Gazette says
my Dorothy was...</i>

06:01.040 --> 06:05.318
..."captivating, charming
and strangely intimidating. "

06:05.840 --> 06:08.513
Oh, Griff, how pathetic are you?

06:08.720 --> 06:12.793
A man your age hanging on
to faded high school glory.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.673
What?

06:18.960 --> 06:21.713
Frankly, I don't buy either one of you
as a shoe salesman...

06:21.920 --> 06:24.992
- ... but if you want to try out for the part-
- Listen, Mr. Director.

06:25.200 --> 06:29.876
I think that you and I should see
eye to eye on this thing.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.989
I think we found our star.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.396
So...

06:48.080 --> 06:52.437
What do you want for your birthday,
my little boy toy?

06:54.520 --> 06:58.195
Is that all I am to you, a boy toy?

06:59.040 --> 07:01.918
Jefferson, it's just an expression.

07:02.120 --> 07:05.032
Like, freeloader...

07:06.840 --> 07:08.558
...or trophy husband.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.793
Honey...

07:13.000 --> 07:17.391
Do you notice any little lines
around my eyes?

07:17.600 --> 07:19.272
You have to come in close to see.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.357
You mean, those crow's feet?

07:24.760 --> 07:26.591
They are not crow's feet.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.677
They are laugh lines.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.829
Honey, nothing is that funny.

07:36.400 --> 07:40.029
Oh, don't pout.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.470
I know something...

07:43.800 --> 07:46.633
...that will make you feel a lot better.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.838
I don't feel like playing Hop on Pop.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.436
<i>No, I'm talking
about the perfect birthday gift:</i>

07:56.640 --> 07:59.029
A health club membership, huh?

07:59.680 --> 08:00.635
Night-night.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.598
Do you really think I need it?

08:03.800 --> 08:07.952
I'm sure my thighs jiggle a little
when I settle into the tanning bed...

08:08.160 --> 08:10.116
...but whose don't?

08:11.560 --> 08:13.994
I'm just worrying over nothing,
right?

08:14.200 --> 08:15.758
I mean-

08:16.360 --> 08:19.158
I still turn you on, don't I, Marcie?

08:23.920 --> 08:26.878
<i>Last chance to buy
this lovely Tom Jones lock et...</i>

08:27.080 --> 08:30.356
<i>...containing his actual chest hair.</i>

08:31.160 --> 08:34.436
Well, if that's not unusual.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.229
<i>Twenty-five seconds.</i>

08:39.280 --> 08:41.510
<i>Twenty-two seconds.</i>

08:43.200 --> 08:44.918
Damn you, Al.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.438
Hey, Peggy.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.473
I brought over Marcie's tool belt
like you asked.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.989
Oh, you're a life saviour.
Needle nose.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.439
Hey...

08:55.640 --> 08:57.119
Peggy.

08:58.240 --> 09:02.870
Do you ever have a fear
that Al is gonna leave you?

09:03.080 --> 09:06.993
Well, I wouldn't call it a fear
so much as a fantasy.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.672
Screwdriver. Why do you ask?

09:09.880 --> 09:12.952
Well, I know that-

09:13.360 --> 09:15.396
You know, I haven't confided
in you much.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.750
And I appreciate that.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.712
But lately I'm just feeling so old
and unattractive...

09:21.920 --> 09:24.798
...and unloved and I just wondered-

09:25.000 --> 09:26.638
How do you handle it?

09:30.720 --> 09:32.278
Well, usually I just thank God...

09:32.480 --> 09:35.074
...I'm not that aging gigolo
that lives next door.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.316
See, if Marcie thinks
I'm losing my looks...

09:39.520 --> 09:41.875
...it's just a matter of time
before she dumps me...

09:42.080 --> 09:43.672
...for some younger guy.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.269
- Stripper.
- Maybe.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.398
With her money
she could have anyone.

09:55.640 --> 09:56.868
Well, I tell you what.

09:57.080 --> 10:00.356
Why don't you just spend
all her money...

10:00.560 --> 10:02.869
...and then she can't afford
to trade you in?

10:03.080 --> 10:06.277
- Think that would work?
- Absolutely.

10:06.480 --> 10:10.029
- Do you have a credit card?
- Yeah, I have one right-

10:12.320 --> 10:14.197
Oh, platinum.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.229
The good stuff.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.839
What's Marcie's limit?

10:19.040 --> 10:21.838
On a good night, six or seven.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.952
The card.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.474
It doesn't have a limit.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.632
Let's do some home shopping.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.558
Wait a minute. Isn't that addictive?

10:33.760 --> 10:37.389
Oh, no. You can stop
any time you want.

10:39.040 --> 10:39.995
What's that for?

10:40.200 --> 10:42.794
So we don't drop the phone.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.631
Hi, baby, mama's back.

10:48.320 --> 10:52.108
"Gary's Shoes," take 28.

10:53.240 --> 10:56.152
And action.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.513
Excuse me, kind sir.

10:59.720 --> 11:02.188
Do you have any purple pumps?

11:05.880 --> 11:08.997
Certainly, we have purple pimps.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.119
At Gary's Shoes, we feet your treat.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.878
Cut.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.916
Okay, Dad, that was-

11:18.120 --> 11:20.554
It was good
but you're still a little stiff.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.799
Any stiffer, you could wax him
and use him as a toboggan.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.673
Could you keep the gofer quiet?

11:28.040 --> 11:30.998
All right. Look, let's just try it again,
all right?

11:32.520 --> 11:33.714
Take 29.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.434
If anybody's still counting.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.519
And action.

11:40.880 --> 11:41.835
Excuse me, kind sir-

11:42.040 --> 11:43.598
Certainly, we pump your purple...

11:43.800 --> 11:47.190
...at Gary's Shoes,
where we treat your feet.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.674
- Cut.
- What?

11:48.880 --> 11:50.313
Those are the right words.

11:50.520 --> 11:51.999
But they were in the wrong order.

11:52.200 --> 11:56.432
Well, can you edit them together?
What kind of a director are you?

11:57.800 --> 12:00.633
You know, I give up.
Okay? You talk to him.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.114
Okay.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.753
So-

12:03.960 --> 12:06.520
Nice weather we're having, Daddy?

12:06.720 --> 12:08.517
I mean, about the part.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.597
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. Okay.

12:10.800 --> 12:11.994
That was perfect, Daddy.

12:12.200 --> 12:16.432
But I think that you need
to emphasise certain words. Like this.

12:16.640 --> 12:20.315
Here at Gary's Shoes,
we treat your feet.

12:20.520 --> 12:21.953
- See what I'm saying?
- Like this.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.229
Okay.

12:23.520 --> 12:28.116
Here at Gary's Shoes,
we treat your feet.

12:30.440 --> 12:33.955
That's- It's much, much better,
Daddy. Really.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.597
Can his ass.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.753
Bud, I'm starting to get the hang of it.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.837
I'm rolling with it.
I'm grooving with it.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.918
- Dad, you're fired.
- I know. Fired up, ready to go.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.917
No, Dad, it's over.

12:52.120 --> 12:56.272
Over, my stage fright is over.
I'm ready to go. Action. Roll them.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.589
Listen to me.

12:58.800 --> 13:03.316
<i>You're fired. You're out.
You're finished. You must flee TV.</i>

13:04.920 --> 13:07.593
Wow, that came out of nowhere.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.038
Why the sudden change of heart?

13:10.240 --> 13:13.471
No, no, it's not sudden.
Your acting sucks.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.639
It sucked when we started.
It sucks now. It will always suck.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.673
Well, that's just one person's opinion,
isn't it?

13:23.880 --> 13:25.916
- It sucks.
- It sucks.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.670
It sucks.

13:30.400 --> 13:34.837
<i>Attention, shoppers,
Al Bundy sucks.</i>

13:39.400 --> 13:42.233
Oh, look.
A genuine faux leopard muff.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.237
Let's not wait for the price.
Just dial.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.668
Okay. Okay, but-

13:45.880 --> 13:49.236
Tell me again how this stuff is going
to keep Marcie from leaving me.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.238
- Is that a liver spot?
- Okay...

13:58.480 --> 13:59.879
What?

14:01.080 --> 14:03.878
Don't you play dumb with me,
Peggy Bundy.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.435
You've always been
a shopping junky.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.269
But now you've turned into a pusher
and corrupted my innocent Jefferson.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.198
Innocent?

14:12.400 --> 14:14.630
<i>Yeah, I may have provided
the TV and the phone...</i>

14:14.840 --> 14:17.274
...but he did his own dialling.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.590
Jefferson, is that true?

14:21.800 --> 14:24.030
- Yes.
- Well, that's it, mister.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.071
Your freeloading days are over.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.748
And you're going to pay back
every cent.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.478
How am I supposed to do that?

14:31.680 --> 14:33.159
Three little words.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.476
I love you?

14:37.160 --> 14:38.559
Try again.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.591
Hop on Pop?

14:50.920 --> 14:52.751
Get a job.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.837
You know, this exercise stuff
is really challenging. Yeah.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.828
I think I'm starting to "feel the burn. "

15:14.400 --> 15:16.436
That's heartburn.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.229
You think you could stop chewing
for one second...

15:19.440 --> 15:21.351
...and help me out of this mess
you got me into?

15:21.560 --> 15:25.599
Oh, yeah, like it's my fault
you're not aging well.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.117
Don't get your varicose veins
in a knot.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.914
There must be some job
that you're qualified for.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.111
I'm just not good at anything.

15:33.320 --> 15:37.871
All right. And launch and twirl.
And launch and-

15:40.280 --> 15:42.919
All right. Fine. Stay fat.

15:50.680 --> 15:54.116
At Gary's Shoes, we treat your-

15:57.120 --> 15:58.792
Cut.

16:00.840 --> 16:01.795
Dad...

16:02.000 --> 16:03.513
...we're trying to work here.

16:03.720 --> 16:04.869
So am I.

16:05.080 --> 16:08.390
Al, you haven't vacuumed
in 25 years.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.955
Then it's high time, isn't it?

16:11.160 --> 16:12.673
Anyway, that was great, Griff.

16:12.880 --> 16:17.112
Great. Great.
You couldn't even tell he was acting.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.556
Let's just do it one more time.
Okay?

16:20.760 --> 16:22.671
Fine. Fine.

16:22.960 --> 16:26.157
Take 32, which is three more
than it took me by the way.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.430
That's because you've ruined
every one of mine.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.471
It's because we had a couple
of accidents.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.592
Oh, dropping a light on Griff's head?

16:34.600 --> 16:36.431
Freak occurrence.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.551
The fire in the stock room?

16:38.760 --> 16:40.796
Act of God.

16:41.360 --> 16:45.433
Rollerblading through here
with your pants down, playing a tuba?

16:46.240 --> 16:48.754
Hey, what I do on my break
is my business.

16:48.960 --> 16:52.191
Admit it, Dad. You're trying
to sabotage the commercial.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.389
Get out of here.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.795
- Don't come back until we're finished.
- Fine.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.434
You Hollywood types are so touchy.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.953
- Ready?
- Yes.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.799
And action.

17:05.440 --> 17:09.069
Excuse me, kind sir,
do you have any-?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.118
Peggy?

17:16.319 --> 17:17.958
What in the world are you doing
here?

17:19.319 --> 17:20.958
Working out.

17:22.440 --> 17:27.275
Excuse me, you can't just walk
into a Jefferson D'Arcy class.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.232
Are you on the list?

17:29.440 --> 17:31.158
Well, no...

17:31.360 --> 17:32.679
...but I'm his wife.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.630
Nice try, honey.
We get four wives a day...

17:35.840 --> 17:38.035
...and a couple of husbands.

17:39.400 --> 17:43.712
Well, maybe if you gave up your spot
they'd all fit.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.995
You just better be glad
I am weak from dieting...

17:52.320 --> 17:53.719
There he is.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.469
Jeffersize. Jeffersize.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.910
Hello, all you lovely ladies.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.839
Are you ready to get hot
and bothered?

18:04.200 --> 18:05.997
Okay, here we go and on our right-

18:06.200 --> 18:07.394
Jefferson. Hi, honey.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.712
Oh, hey, Marcie. Gee, what a surprise.
Okay. Here we go and-

18:10.920 --> 18:13.992
Bend and stretch.
Reach for me, ladies. That's it.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.839
Okay, here we go, grapevine and...

18:17.200 --> 18:19.236
That's it. Beautiful.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.238
That's it.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.238
She won't let me through.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.159
Hey, Marcie, I have a secret weapon.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.193
My Snickers slipped.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.838
Here we go.

18:33.720 --> 18:34.789
One, two-

18:35.440 --> 18:39.149
Hey, Marcie, thank you so much
for making me get this job.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.112
I'll be able to pay you back
in no time.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.197
Well, honey,
you don't have to pay me back.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.118
Consider it a birthday present.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.117
It's Jeffie's birthday.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.038
Spanking machine.

18:49.240 --> 18:52.391
Oh, no. Oh, no- Okay.

18:56.440 --> 18:59.318
Yes, yes, yes.

19:01.040 --> 19:06.034
Jefferson, I hate to see you like this,
slaving away at a job you hate.

19:09.520 --> 19:13.559
Jeffie, can you massage
my cramp again?

19:14.760 --> 19:16.352
I'll give you a cramp.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.708
Jefferson.

19:19.920 --> 19:22.229
I want you to quit your job.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.635
But why, Marcie?
If I keep working here...

19:24.840 --> 19:27.991
...I'm going to have the body
that you've always wanted me to.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.191
- That I've always wanted?
- Yeah.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.630
Jefferson, I love the way you look.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.796
The reason I sent you
to a health club is...

19:35.000 --> 19:38.037
...that I thought you were feeling
insecure about yourself.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.910
Well, I was. I'm-

19:41.120 --> 19:42.838
I'm getting older. I just-

19:43.840 --> 19:45.751
I thought you were gonna...

19:45.960 --> 19:47.712
...trade me in for someone new.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.151
Oh, booberry.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.357
I don't want anybody new.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.279
It took me years to break you in.

19:57.120 --> 20:01.352
You mean, you'll still love me
even when I'm old and grey?

20:01.680 --> 20:05.798
Of course, just like you'll still love me
even if I lose all my money?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.678
Right.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.159
You know, this is great.

20:14.360 --> 20:18.148
I always wanted
my own personal trainer.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.029
Well, well, well.

20:22.240 --> 20:27.030
Looks like my commercial
has made me a few fans.

20:29.280 --> 20:33.478
<i>Yeah, I knew TV added 10 pounds.
I didn't realise it all went to your head.</i>

20:34.680 --> 20:37.797
<i>You're even cuter in person
than you are on TV.</i>

20:38.000 --> 20:39.752
You're a shoe hunk.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.632
Al, help me.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.359
Yeah, they are all yours, shoe hunk.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.710
Think I'll just ease on down the road.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.799
Ladies, please, please.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.596
Hey, hey, that is not for sale.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.638
<i>Don't go away we'll be right back.</i>

21:12.840 --> 21:15.070
Oh, I don't believe this.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.033
- We'll take it.
- We'll take it.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.435
I told you so.

21:25.640 --> 21:28.393
<i>Hey, weren't you Dorothy
in The Wiz?</i>

21:28.600 --> 21:29.874
Yes, I was.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.311
I was the mayor of Munchkin Land.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.475
Your honour.
