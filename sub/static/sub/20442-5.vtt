WEBVTT

00:00.093 --> 00:02.095
- Previously on Good Witch.
- What is it?

00:02.129 --> 00:04.780
A bank account that everybody
seems to have forgotten about.

00:04.812 --> 00:07.033
I've been told "I love
you" by so many people

00:07.058 --> 00:08.739
that those words don't
mean anything anymore.

00:08.772 --> 00:11.037
I look forward to every minute
whenever I'm with you.

00:11.070 --> 00:13.173
- I love you.
- I love you too.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:25.351 --> 00:27.320
Where do you want me to put these?

00:27.354 --> 00:29.624
Right over there is fine.
We'll see if there's anything

00:29.656 --> 00:32.459
we want to put out on the shelves later.

00:37.764 --> 00:39.834
Sorry, we're closing up.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.904
But I'm sure you can make
an exception for the mayor.

00:45.939 --> 00:49.077
Oh my. What's going on here?

00:49.110 --> 00:50.610
Oh, just taking a few days

00:50.644 --> 00:52.680
without customers
to re-arrange some things,

00:52.713 --> 00:55.228
put out some new items
to replace the older ones.

00:55.253 --> 00:57.890
Not change just
for change's sake, I hope.

00:57.923 --> 00:59.892
- Of course not.
- Oh, Cassie,

00:59.924 --> 01:01.760
if only more people
thought the way you do.

01:01.793 --> 01:04.031
I have been trying to explain

01:04.063 --> 01:05.954
to some of the younger members
of the city council

01:05.961 --> 01:08.231
that Middleton's history
should be built upon,

01:08.264 --> 01:10.467
not tossed away and discarded.

01:10.499 --> 01:13.641
Which is why I came in.
Now, you used to have

01:13.674 --> 01:15.456
a map of historic Middleton.

01:15.489 --> 01:17.139
Oh yes, it's, uh, it's right over here.

01:17.172 --> 01:18.604
Oh!

01:20.856 --> 01:22.245
Oh...

01:22.858 --> 01:24.822
it's older than I remembered.

01:24.855 --> 01:26.416
I was hoping to use this to make

01:26.448 --> 01:30.252
the case that things built
in the past should be preserved

01:30.285 --> 01:32.855
rather than replaced. But I suspect

01:32.889 --> 01:35.325
that the younger generation
will see this as ancient history

01:35.358 --> 01:37.887
without any relevance for today.

01:38.447 --> 01:40.685
Well, maybe you can find
a more recent reminder

01:40.717 --> 01:42.298
of all the good that's come before.

01:42.332 --> 01:44.868
I don't know where.

01:44.901 --> 01:46.937
They're closed!

01:46.969 --> 01:48.948
Oh, Dr. Radford! Hello.

01:48.982 --> 01:51.141
Hey. You're done with work early.

01:51.174 --> 01:53.043
I'm heading back.

01:53.076 --> 01:55.044
But I remembered that you said
you needed some empty boxes.

01:55.077 --> 01:57.568
Mmm-hmm. Most of these things
are coming off the shelves.

01:57.601 --> 01:59.559
Well, these were just
lying around the office

01:59.584 --> 02:00.792
and I thought maybe you could use 'em.

02:00.825 --> 02:02.517
We definitely can use them.

02:02.550 --> 02:03.703
- Thank you.
- Sure.

02:04.395 --> 02:06.255
Well, I'll let you get back to work.

02:06.288 --> 02:09.363
Yeah, thanks for coming by.
Don't leave quite so soon.

02:16.715 --> 02:18.651
That was worth the trip.

02:21.353 --> 02:23.222
My goodness!

02:23.254 --> 02:25.424
- You two are getting along well.
- We've been

02:25.456 --> 02:27.393
"getting along well"
for quite some time now.

02:27.425 --> 02:29.494
Well, yes, but... I don't know,

02:29.527 --> 02:32.764
it just seems like there's
something different, that's all.

02:32.798 --> 02:35.366
But I suppose that everything changes,

02:35.400 --> 02:37.436
just like all the items
in your shop. And because

02:37.468 --> 02:39.572
you don't have what I need,
I will get out of your way

02:39.604 --> 02:42.874
so you can make all things new. Oh!

02:42.907 --> 02:44.776
Oh my.

02:50.862 --> 02:53.918
Is this for sale?
It's a meditation stone.

02:54.366 --> 02:57.288
You can take it. It's one
less thing to find a place for.

02:57.322 --> 02:59.913
Then you're welcome. Ta-ta!

03:09.668 --> 03:11.637
Oh, so you do live here.

03:11.669 --> 03:14.973
I know. I'm sorry that I came
home so late last night.

03:15.007 --> 03:17.643
Did you and Courtney get
your history presentation ready?

03:17.675 --> 03:19.944
Yeah. About half of it.

03:19.978 --> 03:22.615
But now I have to worry
about this science project, too.

03:22.647 --> 03:25.683
I'm supposed to be growing
crystals on this string.

03:25.717 --> 03:27.853
And I have to put sugar in there
a couple of times a day.

03:27.885 --> 03:29.754
Hm, 'cause your life wasn't busy enough.

03:29.788 --> 03:31.890
Yeah. Well, maybe they'll just appear,

03:31.923 --> 03:33.925
and I'll be done with it.

03:33.959 --> 03:36.427
So, have you given any more
thought to what you want to do

03:36.461 --> 03:39.598
- for your birthday?
- No. But I will.

03:39.630 --> 03:42.867
Once upon a time, all you wanted to do
was rummage through my jewelry box.

03:42.901 --> 03:45.838
Yeah, the younger version of
me was a lot easier to please.

03:45.871 --> 03:48.439
I just want to make sure
that, this year especially,

03:48.473 --> 03:50.643
you get exactly what you want.

03:50.675 --> 03:52.877
Then I will be sure

03:52.911 --> 03:54.913
to think of something good.

03:58.849 --> 04:00.551
Let us know if you have any more pain;

04:00.585 --> 04:02.655
otherwise, we'll see you in six months.

04:02.687 --> 04:04.789
Thank you. Hi,

04:04.823 --> 04:06.859
- can I help you?
- Hi. Yeah, I hope so.

04:06.891 --> 04:09.627
I'm from out of town and I think
I need to see a doctor,

04:09.661 --> 04:11.597
but I've heard some
sketchy things about this one.

04:11.629 --> 04:13.498
Uh... No.

04:13.532 --> 04:16.401
Dr. Radford is as good
of a doctor as there is.

04:16.435 --> 04:18.971
Well then, you obviously don't
know the man as well as I do.

04:19.004 --> 04:22.840
- Huh?
- Haha! Hey, you made it!

04:22.873 --> 04:24.842
Dr. Sam Radford, look at you!

04:24.874 --> 04:27.077
Hahaha! Yeah!

04:27.111 --> 04:29.080
Eve, this is my buddy Liam
from New York.

04:29.112 --> 04:32.482
Oh! Liam, I've heard a lot
about you. Nice to meet you.

04:32.515 --> 04:34.518
- Nice to meet you.
- Liam's in town

04:34.551 --> 04:36.646
to check out some investment
opportunities.

04:36.671 --> 04:37.888
And to see a friend.

04:37.922 --> 04:39.857
- How's Noah?
- Uh, yeah, he's...

04:39.890 --> 04:41.793
he's good. He's starting
to look into some colleges.

04:41.825 --> 04:43.861
Trying to get Nick to do the same thing.

04:43.893 --> 04:46.364
- Oh yeah. And how's he doing?
- Better, better. Moving here

04:46.397 --> 04:48.700
- was definitely the right thing.
- Good. Well,

04:48.732 --> 04:50.901
driving in, I got a pretty good
sense of why you like it here.

04:50.934 --> 04:54.007
We try to keep the place a secret;
otherwise, everybody would move here.

04:54.041 --> 04:56.827
Oh! Here, let me give you
a key to the house.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.757
Oh, great, I'll just
drop my stuff off there

04:58.782 --> 05:00.011
- before my meeting.
- Who are you meeting with?

05:00.044 --> 05:02.080
There's this equity firm
that reached out to me

05:02.112 --> 05:04.848
a few weeks ago. They said
Middleton's a growing town

05:04.881 --> 05:05.799
with a lot to offer,

05:05.824 --> 05:08.018
and I've been looking for somewhere
to put some retirement funds,

05:08.051 --> 05:10.754
so I figure this way I see you
and write off the trip.

05:10.787 --> 05:13.890
- Oh, so I'm a business deduction now?
- A little bit, yeah.

05:13.924 --> 05:16.060
Well, you picked a good time to come.

05:16.092 --> 05:19.763
There's actually somebody
I'd really like you to meet.

05:20.470 --> 05:21.866
You made it sound
like you're dating someone.

05:21.898 --> 05:25.136
He definitely is.

05:25.169 --> 05:27.038
And why am I not hearing
about this till now?

05:27.071 --> 05:29.474
I was just waiting for it
to get more serious.

05:29.506 --> 05:31.458
So now they're serious?

05:31.491 --> 05:33.316
They definitely are.

05:34.412 --> 05:36.513
Yeah, I guess they are.

05:36.547 --> 05:39.015
Well, OK, great. I'm looking
forward to meeting her,

05:39.049 --> 05:41.386
telling her all
about the Sam Radford I know.

05:41.419 --> 05:44.981
- OK, now I don't want you to meet her.
- Ha! Alright, see you later.

05:54.498 --> 05:56.667
Hey, when did you get here?

05:56.700 --> 05:59.937
Uh, a lot later than I thought I would.

05:59.970 --> 06:01.972
Courtney and I finally finished
that thing for history.

06:02.006 --> 06:04.809
- Oh, that's good.
- Yes, but now I have

06:04.842 --> 06:07.412
to write my English essay
tomorrow morning.

06:07.445 --> 06:09.447
- Then you better get some rest.
- That is my plan.

06:09.479 --> 06:12.484
And don't forget to tell me what you
want to do for your birthday.

06:19.237 --> 06:22.126
What is this?

06:24.727 --> 06:27.164
That's the Merriwick Wish Book.

06:27.662 --> 06:29.929
- How did it get here?
- Well,

06:29.961 --> 06:31.663
that's always a bit of a mystery,

06:31.696 --> 06:34.839
but this book has been passed
down for hundreds of years

06:34.871 --> 06:36.973
to every Merriwick girl
when she turns a certain age.

06:37.006 --> 06:40.143
You're supposed to write
your deepest wish

06:40.176 --> 06:42.580
on one of the pages inside.

06:42.612 --> 06:46.097
So this is full
of what people my age wrote?

06:47.251 --> 06:49.554
I can't wait to see
what they wished for!

06:49.587 --> 06:51.656
Yeah. Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait! Just a minute.

06:51.688 --> 06:54.025
- No, no, I want to read it.
- And you will.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.494
You're not supposed
to open it until your birthday.

06:56.527 --> 06:59.063
- Is that a Merriwick rule?
- You'll just have to wait

06:59.095 --> 07:01.665
a few more days. And then,

07:01.698 --> 07:04.001
well, you'll have time to
come up with the perfect wish.

07:04.034 --> 07:07.805
- And then what happens?
- And then...

07:07.837 --> 07:09.739
your wish comes true.

07:23.943 --> 07:31.988
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

07:39.770 --> 07:41.906
- Good morning.
- Oh, hey.

07:41.938 --> 07:44.040
So...

07:44.073 --> 07:46.710
- did you read it?
- What?

07:46.744 --> 07:49.212
The Wish Book. I put it under
your pillow so you'd find it.

07:49.246 --> 07:51.816
- That was from you?
- Mmm-hmm.

07:51.849 --> 07:54.018
I was the last Merriwick to
have it, and I've been waiting

07:54.051 --> 07:56.888
for this birthday since you were
born so I could give it to you.

07:56.921 --> 07:58.962
I figured you were the one
to keep that tradition alive.

07:59.689 --> 08:03.026
Wasn't it fun reading all the
wishes from through the years?

08:03.059 --> 08:05.996
Mom said that I can't open it
until my birthday.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.902
- Is that what she said?
- Yeah. It's a rule,

08:10.934 --> 08:13.069
I guess.

08:13.102 --> 08:15.038
Maybe so.

08:15.071 --> 08:17.319
What are you gonna wish for?

08:17.914 --> 08:20.143
I don't know.
But if it's going to come true,

08:20.176 --> 08:22.246
I better take it pretty seriously.

08:22.861 --> 08:24.748
Make sure that you do.

08:30.688 --> 08:32.924
Make sure the sous-chefs know exactly

08:32.957 --> 08:34.957
how long it takes
for those soufflés to rise.

08:34.991 --> 08:37.059
And tell the servers they need
to mention the specials

08:37.092 --> 08:39.063
after the diners have sat down.

08:39.096 --> 08:41.265
Oh.

08:44.902 --> 08:48.005
Welcome to Grey House.

08:48.039 --> 08:49.741
Oh! Hello.

08:49.773 --> 08:52.677
You must be Constance. I'm
Cassie. I've been expecting you.

08:52.710 --> 08:55.618
I've been looking forward to
getting away from my restaurants

08:56.011 --> 08:58.083
and thinking about things
other than my kitchen.

08:58.116 --> 09:00.151
Grey House is the perfect place to think

09:00.185 --> 09:03.255
about other things. I have
your room all ready for you.

09:03.287 --> 09:04.901
It's at the top of the stairs,
to the right,

09:04.934 --> 09:06.488
and I'll get your bag up there.

09:06.521 --> 09:08.782
I already feel like I'm relaxing.

09:11.630 --> 09:14.066
- Good morning.
- Hey.

09:14.098 --> 09:17.102
- Do you need any more of these?
- I can always use an extra.

09:17.135 --> 09:19.771
Thanks. I notice

09:19.804 --> 09:22.040
you have an extra car outside;
do you have a friend in town?

09:22.073 --> 09:24.034
Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you.
Liam got in last night.

09:24.059 --> 09:25.611
Your friend from New York.

09:25.643 --> 09:27.244
I really want you guys
to meet, but he had an early

09:27.277 --> 09:29.890
business meeting. Maybe we can
all get together tonight?

09:29.923 --> 09:32.818
Yeah, if I can get enough work
done at the store before then.

09:32.851 --> 09:34.820
OK, well, then I'll let you get to it.

09:49.531 --> 09:51.003
Oh, what's in here?

09:51.036 --> 09:52.938
Uhhh, paintbrushes, I think.

09:52.970 --> 09:56.207
Oh. Should I put them on the shelf?

09:56.241 --> 09:58.644
No, I think they should go
by the front door.

10:01.279 --> 10:03.749
Oh, I'm sorry, we're closed.

10:03.781 --> 10:05.379
Yes, I know, dear. For everyone else,

10:05.412 --> 10:06.756
never for me.

10:08.053 --> 10:11.189
Still replacing the old
with the new, I see.

10:11.222 --> 10:12.991
Oh, rediscovering things we might have

10:13.023 --> 10:14.628
forgotten were already there.

10:14.662 --> 10:17.295
Well, your meditation stone reminded me

10:17.328 --> 10:20.132
of a local tradition I wanted
to share with your daughter.

10:20.165 --> 10:22.434
An activity that you would have
done when you were her age if

10:22.467 --> 10:26.304
- you lived here but you were...
- Living somewhere else.

10:26.337 --> 10:28.840
Yes. Do you happen to know

10:28.872 --> 10:30.675
if Grace is free tomorrow afternoon?

10:30.709 --> 10:33.111
Well, she's been really busy,
but I can try to ask.

10:33.143 --> 10:36.177
You know what? I'll call her myself.

10:36.211 --> 10:38.849
What teenager would
turn down an invitation

10:38.882 --> 10:41.954
to spend an entire afternoon
with their city's own mayor?

10:43.918 --> 10:46.858
Ooh! Are these for sale?

10:46.891 --> 10:49.761
Hmmm... I can spare one.

10:49.794 --> 10:51.730
Which is all that I need.

10:51.762 --> 10:54.098
Excuse me, are you open?

10:54.132 --> 10:56.767
- Not according to the sign!
- I just need some directions.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.170
- We're open for directions.
- OK, great.

10:59.204 --> 11:02.074
- What is it you're looking for?
- Middleton Commercial Investments.

11:02.107 --> 11:05.043
- Oh yeah. Two blocks that way.
- Right.

11:05.075 --> 11:07.045
Good thing I found you
'cause I was headed that way.

11:07.078 --> 11:09.747
No, it's around the corner,
past the second light.

11:09.781 --> 11:12.279
And if you get to the microbrewery,
you've gone too far.

11:12.312 --> 11:13.498
Microbrewery?

11:13.531 --> 11:15.488
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh.

11:15.489 --> 11:17.524
I looked at all of the business
listings, I didn't see that one.

11:17.557 --> 11:19.059
It's one of our many hidden gems.

11:19.093 --> 11:21.529
Oh, well, great. Well,
I'll check that place out.

11:21.561 --> 11:23.597
- OK.
- Thanks.

11:23.630 --> 11:26.100
Sure.

11:44.484 --> 11:48.235
If you were looking for your teacups,
I've moved them over here.

11:48.260 --> 11:50.475
Oh, you rearranged my cupboards?

11:50.500 --> 11:52.469
I'm a well-known executive chef.

11:52.501 --> 11:54.330
I find it difficult to be in a place

11:54.363 --> 11:57.941
- that isn't very well-organized.
- Except you're on vacation.

11:57.975 --> 12:00.344
Mm-hmm. And I want to be able
to have a good time,

12:00.376 --> 12:03.313
so I just did a little bit
of work to make things better.

12:03.347 --> 12:06.482
Hmm. Well, if that's what it
takes to get what you came for.

12:06.515 --> 12:09.786
Actually, I could use your help.

12:12.824 --> 12:15.358
There is absolutely
nothing in this cupboard

12:15.391 --> 12:16.923
that I would ever use in a recipe.

12:16.957 --> 12:19.763
Oh, well, there's organic wheat germ.

12:19.796 --> 12:21.608
And coconut palm syrup right there.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.984
Mmm-hmm. And I don't know
what anyone would ever do

12:23.998 --> 12:26.369
with any of that. Could you

12:26.403 --> 12:28.639
clear out a space

12:28.672 --> 12:30.641
for me in this cupboard?

12:30.674 --> 12:32.363
And we'll just move all of that

12:32.363 --> 12:33.945
way into the back here.

12:34.743 --> 12:37.615
Thanks.

12:46.914 --> 12:49.651
Thank you so much
for coming here, Grace.

12:49.684 --> 12:52.153
Now that we're in the privacy
of my office

12:52.185 --> 12:54.888
I can let you in on a secret
regarding just how special

12:54.921 --> 12:56.891
this upcoming birthday of yours is.

12:56.924 --> 13:00.895
Ooh! And present you with this!

13:00.927 --> 13:04.031
I'm getting a birthday rock?

13:04.065 --> 13:06.066
It's a foundational stone.

13:06.099 --> 13:10.671
Because I've chosen you as one
of "Middleton's Foundations."

13:11.065 --> 13:13.340
That sounds like an honour?

13:13.373 --> 13:15.609
- Indeed, it is.
- Oh.

13:15.642 --> 13:18.211
A select few girls
in Middleton, when they reach

13:18.244 --> 13:20.214
a certain age, your age, are invited

13:20.247 --> 13:22.183
to do something that establishes

13:22.215 --> 13:24.185
their presence in this town forever.

13:24.621 --> 13:26.621
So, pick a colour.

13:28.022 --> 13:31.325
Um... I like blue.

13:31.358 --> 13:35.195
And now paint your name
on the bottom of the stone.

13:35.228 --> 13:38.232
So it's like an art project?

13:38.265 --> 13:41.369
It's to show that you've left
your mark on this town.

13:41.401 --> 13:44.906
Because your presence here
will be remembered.

13:44.939 --> 13:47.308
- Always.
- Wow!

13:47.340 --> 13:48.937
Thank you.

13:49.676 --> 13:51.311
And once you've painted your stone,

13:51.689 --> 13:54.081
I'll show you where I've left my mark.

13:54.114 --> 13:56.149
So...

13:56.819 --> 13:58.819
I'll get to work.

14:00.688 --> 14:02.533
Careful of the rug!

14:09.016 --> 14:10.932
Oh, you're still at it.

14:10.964 --> 14:13.667
Aaah, and I thought you were
going to be at work all day.

14:13.700 --> 14:15.235
Well, I'm supposed to be,
but I thought I'd come home

14:15.268 --> 14:17.238
for a bit in case my daughter decided

14:17.271 --> 14:19.841
- to stop in.
- Ah, well, she hasn't,

14:19.873 --> 14:22.109
and I would have put her
to work if she had.

14:22.142 --> 14:25.779
I just finished clearing out
the last of these cupboards

14:25.813 --> 14:28.416
before I put everything back
the way I think they should be.

14:28.449 --> 14:32.085
- Then, you'll be able to relax?
- Once everything is in its place.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.723
Now, this one is empty so I guess
I can start finally reorganizing.

14:36.757 --> 14:38.792
Are you sure it's completely empty?

14:39.153 --> 14:41.614
I just finished taking everything out.

14:42.063 --> 14:44.832
Oh! It's weird.

14:44.864 --> 14:47.768
There is one more thing. Ohhh.

14:49.790 --> 14:52.826
- Look at all these recipes!
- Here, I can take that.

14:52.860 --> 14:54.829
You're not gonna want to cook
while you're on vacation.

14:54.862 --> 14:57.732
Except I'm always interested
in finding and trying out

14:57.765 --> 15:00.802
- a new recipe.
- Hmm...

15:02.837 --> 15:05.640
Oh! This one looks interesting.

15:05.673 --> 15:08.676
You're welcome to use
my kitchen while I'm gone.

15:08.708 --> 15:12.613
You know what? I think that I will.

15:13.271 --> 15:16.150
- But first, here.
- Oh! What's that for?

15:16.184 --> 15:19.120
It's your shopping list. Believe me,
I've been through your entire kitchen,

15:19.152 --> 15:21.422
and you don't have a single
ingredient that's on there.

15:22.277 --> 15:24.793
- Then I'll be right back.
- Great!

15:32.033 --> 15:35.804
This park is where I placed
my foundational stone.

15:35.837 --> 15:37.806
Oh, you did this when you were my age?

15:37.838 --> 15:41.208
I did! Oh, I had such dreams

15:41.242 --> 15:43.844
of changing the world
and leaving my mark

15:43.877 --> 15:45.847
in so many different places.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.816
Oh, but you decided
to stay in Middleton.

15:47.848 --> 15:49.950
Well, that's the choice
that I made, yes,

15:49.983 --> 15:52.351
but you can do anything you wish to do.

15:53.144 --> 15:56.590
Yeah, once I figure out what I want.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.828
- Cassie!
- Mom!

16:00.862 --> 16:03.631
Hi. What sort of adventure
does the mayor have you on?

16:03.664 --> 16:06.668
I've chosen Grace
as my Middleton Foundation.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.702
Oh. That sounds like quite an honour.

16:08.736 --> 16:10.672
It means I'm leaving my mark.

16:10.704 --> 16:13.174
Hmm. Well, I wish I could join you,

16:13.207 --> 16:15.843
but I was sent out for
some very specific ingredients

16:15.876 --> 16:19.680
by a guest who wants to spend
some time in my kitchen.

16:19.713 --> 16:21.583
Can't wait to see what she makes.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.885
Then I'll see you later?

16:23.918 --> 16:25.687
I hope so.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.888
Ta-ta!

16:27.921 --> 16:30.757
Now, I remember placing my stone

16:30.790 --> 16:33.193
right next to the tallest tree
in the park so that I would

16:33.227 --> 16:35.863
always know where it was
whenever I came back to find it.

16:41.669 --> 16:44.672
Martha, what's wrong?

16:44.704 --> 16:47.841
Well, it's been so long
since I came here looking,

16:47.875 --> 16:50.211
I didn't realize how tall
these other trees had grown.

16:50.243 --> 16:53.046
My foundational stone
could literally be anywhere.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.049
I don't know how I'm ever gonna find it.

16:55.873 --> 16:59.587
Well, I'll always remember
that I placed mine right here.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.724
No! You need to give this
much more thought,

17:02.756 --> 17:05.660
so that you don't forget
where you left your mark.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.262
I guess I could think about it
for another day or two.

17:08.295 --> 17:11.599
While I try to find where I put mine.

17:13.034 --> 17:15.770
Perhaps, possibly,
we should have painted

17:15.803 --> 17:18.573
our names on the top sides
of boulders, instead.

17:21.675 --> 17:23.645
So, am I ever gonna get to meet

17:23.678 --> 17:25.646
this neighbour lady
you claim to be dating?

17:25.679 --> 17:27.714
Ah, she had to go back

17:27.747 --> 17:30.004
- to work. She's been pretty busy.
- Oh yeah?

17:30.036 --> 17:32.252
I'm beginning to wonder
if she even exists.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.972
Haha! I am pretty sure she does.

17:35.452 --> 17:36.924
Well, I hope so,

17:36.958 --> 17:39.285
because you seem pretty in love.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.630
Hate to find out the whole thing
is just in your imagination.

17:43.229 --> 17:46.199
I didn't realize
I was acting that differently.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.070
Yeah. But hey,
it's a good thing I'm here

17:49.102 --> 17:51.906
to let you know you are.

17:52.597 --> 17:54.042
D'oh! Ugh!

18:01.301 --> 18:04.238
Excuse me. They tell me
that you're the owner.

18:04.271 --> 18:06.374
Stephanie Borden.
Yeah. What can I do for you?

18:06.406 --> 18:10.110
- I need a Danish dough whisk.
- Excuse me?

18:10.144 --> 18:12.881
I'm staying at Grey House and
I found an interesting recipe,

18:12.914 --> 18:14.915
but it calls for a Danish dough whisk

18:14.949 --> 18:16.551
and Cassie said you might have one.

18:16.584 --> 18:19.187
- I actually have a couple.
- Can I borrow one, please?

18:19.220 --> 18:21.256
I like to follow the recipe exactly,

18:21.289 --> 18:24.593
- and the card says that I need one.
- Of course. I'll be right back.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.895
- You need to decide.
- OK, honestly,

18:27.929 --> 18:31.132
the biggest thing I want for my birthday
is for my science project to work.

18:31.164 --> 18:33.000
That makes you way too easy to buy for.

18:33.033 --> 18:34.869
No, no. You don't need
to get me anything.

18:34.903 --> 18:37.005
- But we want to do something.
- Yeah,

18:37.038 --> 18:39.007
it's an important birthday
and we want you to remember it.

18:39.039 --> 18:41.343
OK, fine, then you can surprise me.

18:41.375 --> 18:44.578
Ah! Challenge. I like it.

18:44.612 --> 18:46.548
No...

18:46.580 --> 18:50.050
- Take good care of it.
- I certainly will.

18:50.084 --> 18:53.154
- Hey, it's the birthday girl!
- In a couple of days, yes.

18:53.186 --> 18:56.156
I want to do something special for you.
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?

18:56.190 --> 18:58.593
I was thinking about
hanging out with my mom,

18:58.625 --> 19:00.561
maybe helping her out at her shop.

19:00.595 --> 19:02.963
Oh come on, you need to do
something better than that

19:02.997 --> 19:06.534
for your birthday week.
Let me take you to the day spa.

19:06.567 --> 19:09.203
- We'll get our nails done, top to bottom.
- Oh!

19:09.237 --> 19:11.673
The day spa? That sounds fun.

19:11.705 --> 19:14.408
I'm sure wherever you're going
can add one more.

19:14.442 --> 19:17.679
Ahem! It was actually my gift to Grace.

19:17.712 --> 19:20.382
We'll just add me
and we can call it a party.

19:22.450 --> 19:25.086
Sure. I guess you could join us.

19:25.118 --> 19:28.423
- Can we pick you up from school?
- Yes. I will tell my mom.

19:28.455 --> 19:30.324
Sounds great!

19:31.617 --> 19:34.462
Have you decided what
your Merriwick birthday wish

19:34.494 --> 19:37.698
- is gonna be?
- Nope. What did you wish for, anyway?

19:37.731 --> 19:40.301
This isn't about me. It's your birthday.

19:40.335 --> 19:42.569
OK. I'll find out
when I finally get to open it.

19:42.603 --> 19:44.572
And what my mom wrote, too.

19:45.293 --> 19:48.242
- So she hasn't told you?
- Told me what?

19:50.345 --> 19:53.414
Grace, your mom was in foster
care when she turned your age.

19:53.446 --> 19:57.920
- Nobody knew where she was, so...
- So she never got the book?

20:00.654 --> 20:03.959
Which means that she never got
to make her birthday wish.

20:11.527 --> 20:13.850
Mom? Oh!

20:13.883 --> 20:16.353
Um, hi, do you know if my mom's around?

20:16.387 --> 20:18.690
No. She dropped off
the ingredients that I needed

20:18.723 --> 20:22.240
for this and then she said she
had work to do back at her shop.

20:22.273 --> 20:26.055
Oh. Um, where's the sugar?

20:26.088 --> 20:27.865
I put it over there.

20:30.555 --> 20:31.847
Where are my crystals?

20:31.881 --> 20:34.438
Oh, that jar that had nothing inside it?

20:34.472 --> 20:37.642
I moved it out of the way.
I need to have the space

20:37.675 --> 20:39.677
so that I can start in

20:39.709 --> 20:42.346
on this recipe when the mood strikes me.

20:42.379 --> 20:46.771
Oh, could you give your mother a call
and have her pick up what I need?

20:47.885 --> 20:49.921
She probably has what you need

20:49.954 --> 20:51.923
for just about everything.

20:52.651 --> 20:54.125
Except she didn't have

20:54.158 --> 20:57.661
anything that I needed for this,
so I can't imagine

20:57.695 --> 21:00.678
that she would have
the South American vanilla bean

21:00.711 --> 21:03.958
or the Mediterranean sea salt
that I need for that.

21:03.990 --> 21:06.003
Have you

21:06.035 --> 21:08.806
looked in all the right places?

21:14.110 --> 21:17.499
She got these vanilla beans
when she was in South America

21:17.533 --> 21:20.137
last year. And, um...

21:21.485 --> 21:24.642
...salt from the Mediterranean Sea.

21:26.122 --> 21:28.024
- Here you go.
- Oh.

21:28.058 --> 21:31.805
So I guess I can get
started whenever I like.

21:31.837 --> 21:33.736
Then I will leave you

21:33.770 --> 21:35.500
to yourself.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.198
- Got a good grip?
- Yeah, I think so.

21:46.232 --> 21:47.498
Alright!

21:48.234 --> 21:51.471
It's heavier than it looks.

21:51.504 --> 21:53.506
We might need someone
who can give us a hand.

21:53.540 --> 21:56.408
Oh, Cassie!

21:56.441 --> 21:58.356
Thank goodness you're here.

21:58.381 --> 22:00.312
Well, I'll be here
until everything's in its place.

22:00.345 --> 22:04.016
That map of old Middleton,
was that before or after

22:04.050 --> 22:06.052
- the park was built?
- Uh, several years before.

22:06.084 --> 22:08.954
Ugh, then I've wasted
a trip. I was hoping

22:08.987 --> 22:11.857
that seeing the boundary
from a bird's-eye-view might

22:11.890 --> 22:14.427
help jog my memory as to where
I placed my foundational stone.

22:14.459 --> 22:17.296
Hmm, sorry. But since you're here,

22:17.330 --> 22:19.032
do you think you could
help us move this?

22:19.064 --> 22:21.234
Oh! Alright.

22:21.266 --> 22:23.937
It just needs to go
a little bit that way.

22:23.969 --> 22:25.411
Here we go.

22:26.505 --> 22:29.074
Oh, dear. What's this?

22:29.108 --> 22:31.945
Oh, that's the frame
the old map of Middleton was in.

22:31.977 --> 22:34.413
Cassie had me put
something different in it.

22:34.447 --> 22:37.117
- Is this a picture of the park?
- Yeah, it's from right around

22:37.149 --> 22:40.553
- the time you were Grace's age.
- When there were fewer trees...

22:40.587 --> 22:44.090
- Could I get a photo of this?
- Sure. Um, here.

22:44.122 --> 22:47.293
- Use your tablet.
- Here.

22:47.326 --> 22:50.296
- Alright.
- Look at that.

22:50.330 --> 22:53.166
Yeah. You can see every detail.

22:53.198 --> 22:55.267
Middleton was very different back then.

22:55.301 --> 22:57.571
As was this park. You know,

22:57.603 --> 22:59.572
I think I might be able to remember

22:59.606 --> 23:02.309
where my stone is
by using this photo as a map.

23:02.341 --> 23:04.311
Hmm... Well,

23:04.343 --> 23:06.045
thanks for coming in.
I really needed your help.

23:06.079 --> 23:08.248
Yes, well, you girls
are lucky that you have

23:08.281 --> 23:10.851
a mayor who doesn't mind
getting her hands dirty.

23:10.883 --> 23:14.554
Ta-ta!

23:33.062 --> 23:35.609
- Isn't this fantastic?
- Uh, yeah,

23:35.641 --> 23:39.345
except I could have done without
all those people touching my feet.

23:39.379 --> 23:41.348
That's what happens with a pedicure.

23:41.380 --> 23:44.016
Well, I like a manicure better.

23:44.050 --> 23:46.019
You know, you should get
a flower on one of your nails.

23:46.052 --> 23:49.022
- I should?
- Yeah. An amazing artist works

23:49.054 --> 23:51.091
here. I'm gonna go find her. OK.

23:52.039 --> 23:54.428
I can't tell if you're having fun.

23:57.296 --> 23:59.498
It's just I haven't spent that
much time with my mom this week.

23:59.532 --> 24:02.615
I'm sure you'll see her all day
on your birthday.

24:02.647 --> 24:05.971
Yeah. And that's when I'll be able
to read what you wished for,

24:06.004 --> 24:08.007
so you might as well tell me now.

24:09.542 --> 24:12.411
I wished for the best-looking
guy at school to ask me out.

24:14.447 --> 24:18.083
Really? Did it come true?

24:18.117 --> 24:20.353
Yeah, of course it came true.
That's what the book does.

24:21.277 --> 24:23.056
So what happened?

24:23.612 --> 24:25.091
Shawn McLaughlin

24:25.123 --> 24:27.259
called me the next day
and asked me to the prom.

24:27.293 --> 24:30.463
- Oh, that's amazing!
- You'd think so.

24:30.495 --> 24:33.999
Except he was a complete jerk,
we never went out again,

24:34.033 --> 24:37.918
and I feel like I wasted my wish.

24:39.572 --> 24:41.541
But you got what you wanted.

24:41.964 --> 24:44.476
Except maybe I've always
wanted the wrong thing.

24:45.426 --> 24:47.447
Maybe my life would be
completely different

24:47.479 --> 24:49.716
if I wasn't always chasing
the Shawn McLaughlins

24:49.748 --> 24:51.450
of the world.

24:51.849 --> 24:55.088
Maybe I'm supposed to be
looking for something else.

24:56.145 --> 24:58.057
Well, I hope you find it.

24:58.091 --> 25:00.360
And I hope your wish

25:00.392 --> 25:03.129
is a whole lot better
than mine turned out to be.

25:05.430 --> 25:08.000
Thank you.

25:18.042 --> 25:20.480
Mayor Tinsdale?

25:21.331 --> 25:22.649
It's Beverly.

25:22.681 --> 25:24.650
Beverly Todd. You visited

25:24.684 --> 25:27.387
- my kindergarten class last year.
- Oh, Beverly! Yes of course!

25:27.419 --> 25:30.289
Does this look
like the same tree to you?

25:33.098 --> 25:35.261
Um, it's hard to say.

25:35.293 --> 25:38.630
Ugh! Yes, I know.
Everything's changed so much.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.302
I bring my kids here at least
once a month for a field trip.

25:42.334 --> 25:44.370
They just love running around
and exploring the pathways.

25:44.404 --> 25:47.540
Actually, the pathways were my idea.

25:47.572 --> 25:50.176
Now, while they're exploring,

25:50.208 --> 25:52.211
could you have those kids
look for a rock

25:52.245 --> 25:54.613
signed by "Martha E"? Thanks so much.

26:02.086 --> 26:03.656
Are you sure you don't want me to stay?

26:03.688 --> 26:05.624
Oh, no. You should go home to Brandon.

26:05.658 --> 26:07.627
I'm just gonna get a few more
things done here tonight.

26:07.659 --> 26:10.197
- OK. Good-night.
- Ah, good-night.

26:17.518 --> 26:19.072
Hi, Sam.

26:21.073 --> 26:23.043
Do you need any help?

26:23.075 --> 26:26.712
Uh, no. I'm just
about done for the night.

26:26.745 --> 26:29.748
Well, then, I can help you
get you home quicker.

26:29.782 --> 26:31.585
Hmm...

26:52.338 --> 26:54.407
Oh! I didn't realize you were up.

26:54.439 --> 26:57.509
Well, I wanted to get
an early start on this recipe,

26:57.543 --> 27:00.713
and I thought that I could toss
everything together quickly,

27:00.745 --> 27:02.748
but I just found this second card

27:02.782 --> 27:06.119
stuck to the first one
with the final instruction:

27:06.151 --> 27:08.420
"Stir all day."

27:08.454 --> 27:11.257
There must be a very good
reason for doing that.

27:11.290 --> 27:14.094
Well, these recipes are
so interesting and so unique,

27:14.127 --> 27:16.262
I feel like I need
to follow them exactly.

27:16.294 --> 27:18.163
Well, then you're going to need a spoon.

27:18.197 --> 27:20.199
Oh. It's not over there. I moved it.

27:20.233 --> 27:23.136
I needed to rearrange the space
so it worked more efficient.

27:23.168 --> 27:24.704
Oh!

27:27.340 --> 27:29.742
- Thanks.
- Sure.

27:29.774 --> 27:31.878
Oh! Happy Birthday!

27:31.910 --> 27:34.546
Thanks, Mom. It's finally here!

27:34.580 --> 27:36.749
- Oh, it's your birthday?
- Yes.

27:36.782 --> 27:39.218
Why not tell me? I would
have made you something special.

27:39.252 --> 27:41.354
It's OK, thank you.

27:41.387 --> 27:43.456
Hey, I wanted to talk
to you about something.

27:43.488 --> 27:46.226
- Of course.
- So, I woke up this morning

27:46.258 --> 27:49.261
and I went through all these birthday
wishes before I wrote my own.

27:49.294 --> 27:51.630
- You read all the wishes?
- Yeah.

27:53.399 --> 27:55.834
And I want to talk to you
about what was on your page.

27:55.868 --> 27:58.571
Surprise!

27:58.603 --> 28:01.173
- What are you guys doing here?
- Excuse me, but we're gonna

28:01.206 --> 28:03.376
- need to borrow your daughter.
- Just for the day.

28:03.408 --> 28:05.712
But don't worry, we brought
everything she's gonna need.

28:05.745 --> 28:07.714
- Yeah. Some goggles...
- A poncho...

28:07.746 --> 28:10.416
- And some colourful socks!
- Why?

28:10.448 --> 28:12.552
Hey, you didn't have
any plans today, did you?

28:12.584 --> 28:14.319
Oh, wha...?

28:14.352 --> 28:16.656
No. No, no, I guess not.

28:16.688 --> 28:20.526
- Good, because we do. Let's go.
- Where are you taking me?

28:20.560 --> 28:21.860
- Find out when we get there.
- What does that mean?

28:21.893 --> 28:23.695
Try to bring her back in one piece.

28:23.728 --> 28:27.332
- Not a promise we can make.
- Please help me! Love you!

28:27.366 --> 28:29.402
- Let's go!
- Love you!

28:34.639 --> 28:36.809
You went on it how many times?

28:36.841 --> 28:39.211
Grace, I can hardly hear you

28:39.245 --> 28:41.414
over the sound of the rollercoaster.

28:41.447 --> 28:43.850
OK, have fun.

28:43.882 --> 28:45.784
FUN!

28:45.818 --> 28:48.454
Hey!

28:48.486 --> 28:50.822
Hey. I saw your car.
What are you doing not at work?

28:50.856 --> 28:52.892
Well, I had planned to spend the day

28:52.925 --> 28:56.560
with Grace, and then your son
came by and dragged her away.

28:56.592 --> 28:59.242
I should probably head back
there and get the job done.

29:00.162 --> 29:01.839
Uh, Constance, do you need

29:01.871 --> 29:03.706
- anything before I head out?
- No. Thanks.

29:03.740 --> 29:05.943
I just need this sauce to thicken,

29:05.975 --> 29:08.445
if I can ever get it to turn.

29:08.814 --> 29:10.513
I think that moment
will come, eventually.

29:10.547 --> 29:12.616
- Hmm!
- You'll get to that point

29:12.648 --> 29:16.049
where the whole thing changes,
almost in an instant,

29:16.081 --> 29:18.621
and then it's all suddenly different,

29:19.183 --> 29:21.118
except you realize that...

29:22.160 --> 29:24.127
it's exactly the way
it's supposed to be.

29:26.647 --> 29:29.031
- I'll see you later.
- I'll be right here.

29:29.064 --> 29:31.501
OK.

29:33.502 --> 29:36.406
Help me! Shh! Shh! Guys, calm down.

29:36.439 --> 29:38.408
I am so sorry.

29:38.442 --> 29:40.577
Wow! Where did you get all that?

29:40.609 --> 29:42.579
Yeah. Well, my friends took me

29:42.611 --> 29:44.814
to a whole bunch of places
for my birthday.

29:44.848 --> 29:47.618
We thought she'd like getting
out of her house for the day.

29:47.650 --> 29:50.420
- Yes.
- And it turns out

29:50.454 --> 29:52.089
she's a lot better
of a bowler than we knew.

29:52.121 --> 29:54.757
Yeah, seriously. OK, next up,

29:54.791 --> 29:58.060
- cookies and ice cream.
- Ah! Well, I have both.

29:58.093 --> 30:00.157
Except...

30:00.797 --> 30:03.434
I'm kind of still full
from that cotton candy.

30:03.466 --> 30:06.536
Cotton candy's just air;
how can you be full on that?

30:08.104 --> 30:10.207
Actually, I kind of want to go home.

30:11.209 --> 30:13.743
She tires out so easily
now that she's getting

30:13.777 --> 30:16.814
- so old!
- No. Stop. I...

30:16.847 --> 30:20.969
I-I had a really great time. I did!

30:22.018 --> 30:24.087
I just kind of wanna spend the last part

30:24.119 --> 30:26.016
of my birthday with my mom.

30:26.622 --> 30:30.646
- Then you should go.
- Yeah. Happy birthday, Grace.

30:43.939 --> 30:46.389
Hey. What can I get for you?

30:46.422 --> 30:48.151
Could you give me a minute?

30:48.176 --> 30:49.705
- I'm just waiting on a friend.
- Sure.

30:49.737 --> 30:52.049
- It's a nice place.
- Yeah.

30:52.081 --> 30:54.150
I just hope the new owner
doesn't make too many changes.

30:54.184 --> 30:57.380
- There's a new owner?
- Signed the deal today.

30:57.412 --> 30:59.723
- Hey!
- They'll let anybody in here.

30:59.755 --> 31:02.925
Hope so, or else I'm gonna be
out of business.

31:02.958 --> 31:06.929
- I decided to buy this place.
- You're the new owner?!

31:06.963 --> 31:09.066
Yeah.

31:09.099 --> 31:11.635
Did I ever tell you
how much I wanted to own

31:11.667 --> 31:13.770
- my own microbrewery some day?
- Um, no.

31:13.802 --> 31:15.638
Right. Because I didn't
know that I did either.

31:15.672 --> 31:18.541
But then I came and saw
this place and thought,

31:18.575 --> 31:20.677
instead of only investing in it,

31:20.710 --> 31:22.579
why don't I try and run the whole thing?

31:22.611 --> 31:24.192
Well, it'll get you
off from behind that desk.

31:24.217 --> 31:25.548
Exactly.

31:25.581 --> 31:27.418
I guess I didn't realize how
much of a change I was really

31:27.451 --> 31:30.516
looking for until I walked past
all those shops on Main Street

31:30.548 --> 31:33.923
and I thought I can see myself
walking past these every day.

31:34.459 --> 31:36.826
Wait. So you're moving to Middleton?

31:36.859 --> 31:38.794
Just like that?!

31:38.828 --> 31:41.831
It's sudden, I know,
but... I like it here.

31:41.865 --> 31:45.987
I think it'd be great for Noah.
I got a business to run, so why wait?

31:46.020 --> 31:49.224
I just hope I can find a decent doctor.

31:50.072 --> 31:52.208
Two beers over here.

31:52.242 --> 31:53.603
On him.

31:58.915 --> 32:01.585
Martha!

32:01.618 --> 32:03.287
Oh!

32:04.954 --> 32:06.857
What are you doing moving around rocks?

32:06.889 --> 32:08.824
I'm looking for where I made my mark.

32:08.858 --> 32:10.793
But it doesn't seem
like I'm gonna find it.

32:10.827 --> 32:12.796
I guess I'm just going
to have to accept the fact

32:12.829 --> 32:14.964
that all the things I did in the
past are going to be forgotten.

32:14.997 --> 32:17.967
How could anything that
you've done ever be forgotten?

32:18.001 --> 32:20.037
Because I can't find any evidence

32:20.070 --> 32:23.773
- that I was actually here.
- Have you looked around?

32:23.807 --> 32:26.108
- Pardon me?
- I was here

32:26.141 --> 32:28.644
when they rededicated
this park in honour of you.

32:28.677 --> 32:31.982
Oh, yes, I was very impressed
by the turn-out.

32:32.014 --> 32:33.617
And they talked
about all the other things

32:33.649 --> 32:36.352
that happened because of you,
like the fountain

32:36.386 --> 32:38.355
that you had restored
or the clock that finally works

32:38.387 --> 32:40.590
on Main Street.
Even the "Welcome to Middleton"

32:40.624 --> 32:42.159
sign that hadn't been there in years.

32:42.192 --> 32:45.329
Changes to all the older
things that I made new,

32:45.361 --> 32:47.363
just like Cassie said.

32:47.397 --> 32:50.166
You're everywhere.
It's like Martha Tinsdale

32:50.200 --> 32:52.612
was the past, the present,
and the future.

32:53.430 --> 32:54.738
Which I suppose

32:54.771 --> 32:57.174
makes my search for a stone
with my name on it

32:57.206 --> 32:59.175
all the less important.

32:59.208 --> 33:02.211
- You put your name on a stone?
- Oh, yes.

33:02.244 --> 33:04.214
When I turned Grace's age.

33:04.246 --> 33:07.116
It's a long-standing tradition
to take a stone,

33:07.149 --> 33:08.884
well, like this one for instance,

33:08.917 --> 33:10.353
and paint your name on the bottom of it,

33:10.387 --> 33:12.822
so that...

33:12.856 --> 33:16.225
Oh my.

33:16.259 --> 33:18.127
It's my foundation stone.

33:21.431 --> 33:24.067
Look at that. You really

33:24.099 --> 33:27.971
- are a part of this town.
- I guess I am.

33:28.003 --> 33:30.240
It is nice to see it so clearly.

33:31.493 --> 33:34.011
You know, you should put it
underneath that little tree.

33:34.043 --> 33:36.879
That way, you can watch it
grow along with Middleton

33:36.913 --> 33:41.084
- and always know where it is.
- That is an excellent idea.

33:48.301 --> 33:50.926
- Looks good there.
- Yes.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.263
Yes, it does.

33:56.066 --> 33:58.702
- OK.
- Oh!

34:01.737 --> 34:05.307
- Hi there.
- Hey, um, what are you making?

34:05.340 --> 34:09.045
The same thing that I've been making
all day. But it's almost finished.

34:09.079 --> 34:11.781
Is there anything that I can do to help?

34:11.813 --> 34:14.449
No. I think I just have to stand here

34:14.484 --> 34:17.487
until it's done. Oh!

34:18.659 --> 34:20.024
Happy birthday.

34:21.858 --> 34:23.085
Thanks.

34:28.496 --> 34:30.466
Oh! Hey, Grandpa.

34:30.498 --> 34:33.704
- Hey, it's the birthday girl.
- What are you doing?

34:33.735 --> 34:36.438
Oh, your mother mentioned
this old jewelry box

34:36.472 --> 34:38.741
of hers was broken so I was

34:38.774 --> 34:40.275
fixing the hinge.

34:40.309 --> 34:42.445
There.

34:42.478 --> 34:45.147
That should keep
things from falling out.

34:45.179 --> 34:48.150
Hey, I've got a gift for you later.

34:48.652 --> 34:50.699
I hope it's the right size.

34:50.732 --> 34:52.987
Wait. You bought me clothes?

34:53.021 --> 34:55.123
It's money. About this big!

34:55.158 --> 34:57.194
Oh, that is the perfect size.

34:57.227 --> 35:00.931
Thank you.

35:29.636 --> 35:31.873
_

35:52.115 --> 35:54.084
- You know? Haha!
- Not bad.

35:54.117 --> 35:55.986
- Abigail!
- Sam.

35:56.019 --> 35:57.953
- Hey, this is my friend, Liam.
- Hi.

35:57.986 --> 36:00.991
- Abigail is Cassie's cousin.
- Oh, so you've actually

36:01.024 --> 36:03.026
- seen her, huh?
- Every now and then.

36:03.059 --> 36:05.015
Liam just bought this place.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.275
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:06.308 --> 36:08.801
As one Middleton business
owner to another: welcome.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.167
- Thanks.
- Abigail owns a flower shop.

36:11.200 --> 36:14.470
- OK.
- I'm meeting a salesperson here.

36:14.504 --> 36:16.339
Every time he comes
to my store, all he does

36:16.372 --> 36:18.241
is look around and tell me
everything he'd do differently.

36:18.274 --> 36:21.478
- Neutral territory; that's smart.
- Thank you.

36:23.546 --> 36:25.881
Oh, there he is.

36:25.914 --> 36:28.517
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

36:28.551 --> 36:31.288
See you.

36:31.321 --> 36:34.089
I left you some sauce in the kitchen.

36:34.122 --> 36:36.542
So things turned out the way you wanted.

36:37.108 --> 36:38.870
They did.

36:38.903 --> 36:41.914
And not just with the recipe.

36:41.947 --> 36:44.266
You know, I was standing
in your kitchen in silence

36:44.300 --> 36:47.336
with nothing but the sound
of the wooden spoon hitting the bottom

36:47.370 --> 36:49.642
of the pot, and I realized

36:49.675 --> 36:53.109
that this is the way life could be,

36:53.142 --> 36:55.245
if only I would just let it be

36:55.278 --> 36:57.414
- that way.
- Sometimes, it's in the quiet

36:57.446 --> 36:59.416
that we hear the loudest things.

36:59.448 --> 37:02.586
Yes. I'm going to try
and do that more often.

37:03.429 --> 37:04.486
And I'm gonna

37:04.519 --> 37:07.375
give the people that work for me
the same chance.

37:08.191 --> 37:10.227
- Thank you, Cassie.
- Aww...

37:10.260 --> 37:13.330
Come back any time.

37:13.363 --> 37:16.131
- The kitchen can be all yours.
- When I come back,

37:16.164 --> 37:20.002
- I'm going to leave the cooking to you.
- OK.

37:28.343 --> 37:30.412
- Cassie!
- Sam.

37:30.446 --> 37:34.253
- This is Liam!
- Actually, we sort of already met.

37:34.285 --> 37:36.185
Yeah. Did you find
the place you were looking for?

37:36.218 --> 37:38.521
Yeah. Thanks to you.
Cassie's the one who told me

37:38.553 --> 37:41.423
that the microbrewery was there.

37:42.642 --> 37:44.160
And did you end up checking it out?

37:44.193 --> 37:46.714
He ended up buying it.
And he's moving here.

37:46.746 --> 37:49.231
Yeah. So it turns out you give
pretty good directions.

37:49.265 --> 37:51.635
- Hmm.
- Do you want to come in for a minute?

37:51.667 --> 37:54.570
I would love to, but it's
my daughter's birthday.

37:54.604 --> 37:56.673
Oh, nice! I've got a son.
He's the same age as Nick.

37:56.705 --> 37:58.908
I look forward to getting
to know both of you.

37:58.941 --> 38:01.377
- Thanks. You too. Good night.
- Good night.

38:04.948 --> 38:07.017
- I love you.
- I love you more.

38:14.356 --> 38:17.026
- Thank you.
- Well, I always take

38:17.059 --> 38:19.028
extra effort for the people
I like the best.

38:19.062 --> 38:21.031
- Stephanie.
- Grace,

38:21.064 --> 38:23.433
- I didn't know you were home.
- For a while, yeah.

38:25.367 --> 38:27.570
Your mom ordered it special for you.

38:27.602 --> 38:31.073
- Oh, it's beautiful!
- I made your favourite kind.

38:31.106 --> 38:33.642
Well, any day that ends
with cake is a perfect day.

38:33.676 --> 38:35.578
Do you want to stay
and have a piece with us?

38:35.611 --> 38:39.449
Ah, no, it's family time, so
get to it. But enjoy the cake,

38:39.481 --> 38:42.251
- 'cause it is really good.
- Oh, I bet.

38:42.285 --> 38:44.254
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

38:44.287 --> 38:45.433
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.624
Bye.

38:47.656 --> 38:51.160
- Ooh, is there ice cream, too?
- Of course.

38:51.193 --> 38:53.195
And caramel sauce

38:53.229 --> 38:56.031
- made fresh all day.
- Wait. This is

38:56.064 --> 38:57.733
what Constance was making in here.

38:57.767 --> 39:00.035
It's my favourite!

39:00.068 --> 39:03.072
And I happen to know that
she followed the recipe exactly.

39:03.106 --> 39:06.176
Hmm.

39:06.209 --> 39:09.446
- Aah...
- Mm-hmm!

39:09.479 --> 39:11.013
- Gonna eat?
- Let's eat.

39:13.048 --> 39:15.751
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

39:15.785 --> 39:18.187
Thank you for making
everything so special.

39:18.220 --> 39:19.711
Except I didn't make
the sauce or the cake.

39:19.744 --> 39:21.790
I know. But you knew
how much I'd like each.

39:21.824 --> 39:23.603
I know my daughter a little bit.

39:23.636 --> 39:25.729
- Just a little.
- Yeah.

39:25.762 --> 39:27.664
Ooh, I, um, I have something for you.

39:27.696 --> 39:30.233
- On your birthday?
- Well, it's for both of us,

39:30.265 --> 39:33.068
- kind of.
- OK.

39:33.102 --> 39:35.538
Martha wants me to put this
in the right place,

39:35.571 --> 39:38.341
but the only place that I want it to be

39:38.374 --> 39:42.279
next to is yours, so...

39:44.213 --> 39:46.182
I made you this.

39:46.214 --> 39:49.551
So can we go out tomorrow
and find a spot together?

39:50.121 --> 39:52.121
So we'll always be connected.

39:52.155 --> 39:53.656
Forever.

39:53.689 --> 39:56.259
Yeah.

39:56.292 --> 39:58.595
You want to show me
what you wrote in there?

39:58.627 --> 40:01.296
I do. Except

40:01.330 --> 40:04.067
I'm sorry that you never got
to write in yours.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.469
Hmm.

40:07.119 --> 40:09.772
This is where it would have gone.

40:09.805 --> 40:12.208
Well, then, it's good that
there's still room in there.

40:14.209 --> 40:16.311
I grew up knowing about this book,

40:16.345 --> 40:19.381
but when it didn't show up
on my special birthday,

40:19.414 --> 40:21.483
I wrote down my wish anyway.

40:22.028 --> 40:23.586
Kept it in my jewelry box.

40:24.239 --> 40:26.455
In the envelope.

40:28.191 --> 40:30.426
So this is what you wished
for when you were my age?

40:30.459 --> 40:33.095
It's everything I hoped for.

40:39.501 --> 40:41.637
"A life filled with love."

40:43.238 --> 40:45.074
Is that a wish that's come true?

40:45.551 --> 40:47.577
It comes true every single day.

40:54.716 --> 40:58.354
Look. This is what I wrote this morning.

40:58.387 --> 41:00.946
It's the only thing that I wanted.

41:00.979 --> 41:03.392
"A perfect moment

41:03.426 --> 41:05.905
with just me and my mom."

41:07.573 --> 41:09.265
And that's a wish

41:09.298 --> 41:11.434
that's coming true right now.
