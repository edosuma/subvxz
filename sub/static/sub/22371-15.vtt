WEBVTT

00:08.592 --> 00:11.960
(hammers pounding in distance)

00:21.688 --> 00:24.100
<i>Carl: I remember my 8th birthday
at the KCC</i>

00:24.191 --> 00:25.807
<i>with that giant cake</i>

00:25.901 --> 00:29.940
<i>and Aunt Evie showing up
on leave, surprising all of us.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:32.146
<i>I remember Mom.</i>

00:32.241 --> 00:34.949
<i>I remember Codger.</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:39.154
<i>I remember school
and going to the movies</i>

00:39.248 --> 00:42.616
<i>and Friday-night pizza
and cartoons</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:45.167
<i>and Grandma and Grandpa
and church,</i>

00:45.254 --> 00:48.622
<i>those summer barbecues
in the kiddie pool you got me.</i>

00:48.715 --> 00:50.956
<i>Could've used that
at the prison.</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:52.712
<i>(chuckles)</i>

00:52.803 --> 00:55.170
<i>You told me about the walks
we'd take when I was three,</i>

00:55.264 --> 00:58.302
<i>you holding my hand,
around the neighborhood,</i>

00:58.392 --> 01:00.224
<i>all the way to Ross' farm.</i>

01:00.310 --> 01:03.177
<i>I didn't know that
I remembered them, but I do.</i>

01:03.272 --> 01:05.639
<i>'Cause I see the sun
and the corn</i>

01:05.732 --> 01:07.393
<i>and that cow
that walked up to the fence</i>

01:07.484 --> 01:08.849
<i>and looked me in the eye.</i>

01:08.944 --> 01:10.400
<i>And you told me about
all that stuff,</i>

01:10.487 --> 01:12.979
<i>but it isn't just that stuff.</i>

01:13.073 --> 01:15.405
<i>It's how I felt.</i>

01:15.492 --> 01:18.985
<i>Holding your hand,
I felt happy and special.</i>

01:19.079 --> 01:21.320
<i>I felt safe.</i>

01:22.916 --> 01:26.034
<i>I thought growing up
was about getting a job</i>

01:26.128 --> 01:28.836
<i>and maybe a family,
being an adult,</i>

01:28.922 --> 01:31.380
<i>but growing up
is making yourself</i>

01:31.466 --> 01:33.753
<i>and the people you love safe--</i>

01:33.844 --> 01:36.836
<i>as safe as you can,
because things happen.</i>

01:36.930 --> 01:38.512
<i>They happened before.</i>

01:38.599 --> 01:41.387
<i>You were shot
before things went bad.</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:45.515
<i>Kind of felt like things
went bad because you were shot.</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:48.223
<i>I want to make you feel safe,
Dad.</i>

01:48.317 --> 01:51.605
<i>I want you to feel just like
I felt when you held my hand.</i>

01:51.695 --> 01:54.687
<i>Just to feel that way
for five minutes.</i>

01:54.781 --> 01:57.864
<i>I'd give anything
to make you feel that way now.</i>

01:59.286 --> 02:02.449
<i>I wanted to kill Negan.</i>

02:02.539 --> 02:06.123
<i>I wish I did.
Maybe it would've been done.</i>

02:06.209 --> 02:08.371
<i>I don't think it's done now.
You went out there again,</i>

02:08.461 --> 02:10.044
<i>but I don't think
they surrendered.</i>

02:10.130 --> 02:12.792
<i>I don't think
they</i> will <i>surrender.</i>

02:12.883 --> 02:14.089
<i>Maybe they'll get out somehow.</i>

02:14.176 --> 02:15.917
<i>But if they don't...</i>

02:16.011 --> 02:18.298
<i>There are workers in there, Dad.</i>

02:18.388 --> 02:20.299
<i>They're just regular people--</i>

02:20.390 --> 02:23.098
<i>old people,
young people, families.</i>

02:23.185 --> 02:25.677
<i>You don't want them to die,
Dad.</i>

02:25.771 --> 02:27.808
<i>We're so close
to starting everything over,</i>

02:27.898 --> 02:29.480
<i>and we have friends now.</i>

02:29.566 --> 02:31.853
<i>It's that bigger world
Jesus talked about--</i>

02:31.943 --> 02:33.399
<i>the Kingdom, the Hilltop--</i>

02:33.487 --> 02:35.979
<i>there's-- there's got to be
more places,</i>

02:36.073 --> 02:37.734
<i>more people out there,</i>

02:37.824 --> 02:41.442
a <i>chance for everything
to change and keep changing,</i>

02:41.536 --> 02:42.742
<i>people's lives getting better,</i>

02:42.829 --> 02:45.412
<i>the bigger world
getting better and better,</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:47.490
<i>growing food for each other,
protecting each other,</i>

02:47.584 --> 02:49.200
<i>keeping everyone healthy,</i>

02:49.294 --> 02:52.252
<i>everyone giving everyone
the opportunity to have a life--</i>

02:52.339 --> 02:54.250
a real life.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.083
<i>So if they won't end it,
you have to.</i>

02:57.177 --> 02:59.418
<i>You have to give them
a way out.</i>

02:59.513 --> 03:01.880
You have to find peace
with Negan,

03:01.973 --> 03:04.260
<i>find a way forward somehow.</i>

03:04.351 --> 03:06.558
<i>We don't have to forget
what happened,</i>

03:06.645 --> 03:09.262
<i>but you can make it so that
it won't happen again,</i>

03:09.356 --> 03:11.393
<i>that nobody has to live
this way,</i>

03:11.483 --> 03:13.770
<i>that every life
is worth something.</i>

03:13.860 --> 03:15.726
<i>Start everything over.</i>

03:15.821 --> 03:18.734
<i>Show everyone that they can
be safe again without killing,</i>

03:18.824 --> 03:20.280
<i>that it can feel safe again,</i>

03:20.367 --> 03:22.734
<i>that it could go back
to being birthdays</i>

03:22.828 --> 03:26.492
<i>and school and jobs and even
Friday-night pizza somehow.</i>

03:26.581 --> 03:30.119
<i>And walks with a dad
and a three-year-old holding hands.</i>

03:30.210 --> 03:32.292
<i>Make that come back, Dad.</i>

03:32.379 --> 03:34.871
<i>And go on those walks
with Judith.</i>

03:34.965 --> 03:37.127
<i>She'll remember them.</i>

03:37.217 --> 03:38.833
<i>I love you.</i>

03:38.927 --> 03:40.668
<i>Carl.</i>

03:56.862 --> 03:59.274
(sighs)

04:04.828 --> 04:07.411
(bed creaks)

04:34.441 --> 04:37.183
(papers rustling)

04:42.240 --> 04:45.107
(theme music playing)

05:22.280 --> 05:28.276
I came back here
to make amends.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.579
We got things done.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.406
We were good together,
Simon.

05:35.252 --> 05:39.917
As I said, we stood on
the precipice of greatness,

05:40.006 --> 05:42.668
and we tripped.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.922
I let my fondness for you
cloud my vision,

05:46.012 --> 05:47.377
which is a credit to you,

05:47.472 --> 05:50.635
because I'm quite
a pragmatic man.

05:50.725 --> 05:54.810
Yeah, got to trust
your gut, Simon.

05:54.896 --> 05:58.184
Don't throw this away
on a setback.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.765
(scoffs)

05:59.860 --> 06:02.648
"Setback"?

06:02.737 --> 06:05.024
You made me
look like an ass.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.277
My intel wasn't current.

06:07.367 --> 06:12.828
You know, things changed
at Alexandria.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.200
Juice.

06:14.291 --> 06:18.376
Juice and momentum
can change the game.

06:18.461 --> 06:22.250
They had it, and they did it.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.458
Margaret had the Hilltop
by the nuts.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.792
I didn't know it.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.845
And, yes, we paid a price.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.923
But let me make it right
with Negan, hmm?

06:34.436 --> 06:37.053
I'm Negan.

06:37.147 --> 06:41.436
And not in a collective,
"We're all Negan" sense.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.143
I have assumed control
of the Saviors.

06:44.237 --> 06:48.151
Negan is no longer
on the field of play.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.403
You're the man now?

06:50.493 --> 06:52.404
I am.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.951
(glasses clink)

06:54.039 --> 06:55.621
I knew it.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.950
I knew you could do it.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.833
Negan was a big personality,
I get it,

07:03.924 --> 07:05.540
but, uh...

07:05.634 --> 07:07.295
too unconventional.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.376
Pulled his punches.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.632
Exactly.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.759
Whereas you
are the kind of man

07:12.849 --> 07:16.592
people can look at and say,
"Now there is a leader."

07:16.686 --> 07:18.768
Which is why

07:18.855 --> 07:23.190
I can't be seen
going easy on you.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.267
Optics.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.649
See, if the Saviors
are gonna win this thing,

07:27.739 --> 07:31.698
I can't be stepping into
the role with... baggage.

07:31.785 --> 07:35.403
Not "if" you win.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.408
It's "when."

07:37.499 --> 07:38.864
And after that,

07:38.959 --> 07:41.826
you're gonna need someone
at the Hilltop who can produce.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.129
We won't need anyone there
until we re-staff

07:45.215 --> 07:46.956
the entirety of the colony.

07:47.050 --> 07:50.213
We're going
for full turnover there.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.293
Everyone?

07:51.388 --> 07:55.302
Everyone-- civies to sargies.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.266
Listen...

08:02.357 --> 08:05.019
You don't have to worry
about optics now.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.817
- 'Cause you--
- Oh, I know.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.315
I have that juice.

08:09.406 --> 08:12.944
I have that momentum.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.741
I want to keep it.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.035
ETQO, you go.

08:17.747 --> 08:18.862
(glass thuds)

08:18.957 --> 08:20.868
Well, that is just
breathlessly stupid.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.074
Yep.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.408
You think
these Troglodytes here

08:23.503 --> 08:26.712
are gonna advise you
in managing communities,

08:26.798 --> 08:29.039
in resource reallocations?

08:29.134 --> 08:30.750
In politics?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.255
That's right, yeah,

08:32.345 --> 08:35.633
the bare-knuckle gnad mash
of politics?

08:35.724 --> 08:38.842
It is ended,
Gregory.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.427
No!
I've achieved too much!

08:41.520 --> 08:43.432
L-I-I've suffered too much!

08:43.523 --> 08:46.436
I've survived too much
for it to end like this!

08:46.526 --> 08:48.563
I've lashed myself
to the bow,

08:48.653 --> 08:50.269
seen through the storm,

08:50.363 --> 08:54.072
and I have been reborn
as a-a certified shit kicker!

08:54.159 --> 08:56.275
I make things happen!

08:56.369 --> 08:58.656
I've always
made things happen.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.988
And it's not
gonna end with me

09:01.082 --> 09:03.494
wandering off
into the wilderness

09:03.585 --> 09:05.542
with my dick in my hand.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.586
I put things together
when everything fell apart,

09:08.673 --> 09:10.209
and I can do it again.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.836
<i>I will</i> do it again.

09:11.926 --> 09:15.464
You know, who the hell
are you to tell me I'm done?

09:15.555 --> 09:18.092
Yeah, you think
you have the juice?

09:18.183 --> 09:20.140
Well, I am the juice!

09:20.226 --> 09:22.183
- No!
- Whoa!

09:26.733 --> 09:30.101
(breathing heavily)

09:30.195 --> 09:31.606
(groans)

09:31.696 --> 09:33.107
First...

09:33.198 --> 09:36.316
I wasn't gonna
send you away.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.491
I was gonna kill you.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.696
(breathing heavily)

09:41.790 --> 09:43.497
Second...

09:43.583 --> 09:45.915
do you make coffee?

09:49.923 --> 09:53.006
Best in the land.

09:54.552 --> 09:59.422
We'll start with coffee
and see where it goes.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.223
Rachel:
He's still out here.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.050
Didn't see him
when we left.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.726
Maybe he finally
gave up.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.429
Nope. He won't.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.981
Not unless we make him.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.024
We should just kill him.

10:11.111 --> 10:16.026
(walker growling)

10:16.116 --> 10:17.857
I got it.

10:17.951 --> 10:21.364
(growling continues)

10:21.454 --> 10:23.536
(grunts)

10:25.625 --> 10:28.208
Told ya.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.334
Kathy:
Has he eaten?

10:33.424 --> 10:38.544
(breathing heavily)

10:38.638 --> 10:40.003
We made our choice.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.214
He wants to die
in the woods,

10:42.308 --> 10:44.390
hoping we
change our minds.

10:44.477 --> 10:48.015
That's his choice.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.393
Find yourself some water.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.777
Seems like a waste
of good garlic to me.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.779
And everything else.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.612
That sardine mac-and-cheese
recipe I gave you

11:04.706 --> 11:06.413
was a staple
from my college days

11:06.499 --> 11:08.786
when,
as a cash-strapped student,

11:08.877 --> 11:11.790
I had to pad out
the budget-minded goodness

11:11.880 --> 11:13.462
of M-and-powdered-C

11:13.548 --> 11:17.212
with the protein power
of canned sardines...

11:17.302 --> 11:20.044
which provided
a longer-lasting energy source

11:20.138 --> 11:21.424
than pure carbohydrates.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.596
The garlic sauté
alleys what originated

11:23.683 --> 11:26.095
as a purely "oops" dish.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.808
Mmm.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.231
Takes me back.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.104
Start plating it up.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.606
This is all that's on the menu

11:36.696 --> 11:40.064
for the rest of the time
till this order's complete.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.399
(spoon tapping)

11:42.493 --> 11:46.452
(tapping continues)

11:49.042 --> 11:52.330
I'd like to remind everyone
that our lives are not on lock.

11:54.339 --> 11:58.458
Out of personal respect
to the mutual nature with Negan,

11:58.551 --> 12:00.383
but Negan is MIA.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.632
Simon has taken over,
and he has requested

12:02.722 --> 12:05.430
an exponential acceleration
of production.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.724
More shots on the lickety-quick.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.271
Even if we're double-timing it
around the clock

12:16.361 --> 12:19.319
with nary a carey
for workplace safety,

12:19.405 --> 12:23.490
it isn't gonna prevent us
from meeting our quixotic quota

12:23.576 --> 12:26.113
by the proverbial crap-ton.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.662
The best that we can hope for

12:28.748 --> 12:31.615
is that we somehow manage
to squeeze out

12:31.709 --> 12:34.041
the bare minimum
number of rounds necessary

12:34.128 --> 12:36.119
to avoid the consequences
of Simon

12:36.214 --> 12:38.205
finding out how short we are.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.131
(Gabriel coughing)

12:44.222 --> 12:47.305
(coughing continues)

12:51.145 --> 12:53.011
- No.
- (sniffles, coughs)

12:53.106 --> 12:55.222
Put that mask back on now.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.693
The last thing we can afford
is for yours truly

13:00.780 --> 13:03.317
to contract whatever
kind of nasty infected you

13:03.408 --> 13:05.399
with your improper
guthandfing.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.326
My current theory is that
it's either influenza

13:08.413 --> 13:10.404
or cryptococcosis
and therefore airborne.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.159
If it was
of the blood variety,

13:12.250 --> 13:13.866
you would've already
been dead.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.167
But the fact remains
you're packing pathogens

13:16.254 --> 13:17.710
that can sting with a sneeze,

13:17.797 --> 13:19.913
making it imperative
that you maintain your PPE

13:20.008 --> 13:22.249
at all times while your meds
run their course.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.799
Now hold out your hand.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.427
Feel that.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.731
Primers aren't flush.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.185
The finished rounds
pose the deadly risk

13:41.279 --> 13:43.566
of slam-firing as soon as
they're loaded into the chamber.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.193
Given that this imperfection
is readily evident to the touch,

13:46.284 --> 13:47.900
I can only assume
that this oversight

13:47.994 --> 13:49.359
was purely intentional.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.195
No.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.451
I didn't know.

13:54.792 --> 13:55.907
I just wanted to make it

13:56.002 --> 13:57.959
so that the bullets didn't work.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.959
I wasn't trying to hurt anyone.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.381
I don't want
any of my people to die.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.425
If you cannot accept
that we're your people now,

14:05.511 --> 14:06.751
you may as well
cut to the chase

14:06.846 --> 14:09.383
and chew the next bullet
coming off that line.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.215
Is that what you want?

14:11.309 --> 14:12.845
No.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.599
That's not what I want.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.977
I don't want that.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.685
I don't want to help you.

14:22.779 --> 14:26.738
But...

14:26.824 --> 14:28.781
I do fear death.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.784
Maybe all this--
Maybe this is just His way

14:34.874 --> 14:38.242
of showing me
that I haven't changed...

14:38.336 --> 14:40.418
a way of showing me
that I'm still

14:40.505 --> 14:46.000
the same person who locked
my parishioners out so long ago.

14:46.094 --> 14:49.428
I'm still
the same scared animal,

14:49.514 --> 14:52.882
doing what I must to survive
just like you.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.136
Being alive
may be something

14:54.227 --> 14:57.515
we don't have in common
for much longer.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.814
You are hereby suspended
from the line.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.267
Go find an unobtrusive corner

15:03.361 --> 15:06.274
and stow your load
and keep your mitts to yourself.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.277
(crying)

15:10.368 --> 15:12.655
And try not to cry too loud.

15:15.123 --> 15:18.661
I want to go outside and test-fire
some of these rounds

15:18.751 --> 15:21.664
that you didn't compromise
with your chicanery.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.751
(door creaks)

15:49.449 --> 15:52.692
(walkers growling)

15:52.785 --> 15:58.030
(whistles)

15:58.124 --> 16:00.331
Surprised to see me?

16:00.418 --> 16:02.534
Shouldn't be.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.497
(chuckles)

16:07.592 --> 16:09.708
Hell yeah,
I'm surprised.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.089
We found your car,
and Simon thought that--

16:12.180 --> 16:13.841
Give me a hand with this,
will you?

16:23.149 --> 16:26.517
Not gonna lie--
a real punch in the dick

16:26.611 --> 16:28.352
when Rick cornered me
in the basement

16:28.446 --> 16:30.528
with those
decomposing assholes

16:30.615 --> 16:32.947
and you fellas
never showed up.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.529
Simon thought--

16:39.624 --> 16:42.992
I want to know
what you were thinking.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.123
(growling continues)

16:46.214 --> 16:50.299
See, I want to know
if you remember who you are.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.757
This little talk
is just between me and you.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.558
Simon's your number two.

17:00.645 --> 17:03.387
I thought
you wanted him calling it.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.768
I remember who I am.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.098
I'm Negan.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.146
Good.

17:13.241 --> 17:16.575
That's what I like to hear.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.777
Now do me a favor.

17:18.871 --> 17:23.616
Put that smoke out
right there.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.580
See, when the time comes--

17:30.675 --> 17:32.416
and you will know
when it comes--

17:32.510 --> 17:35.423
I want you to remember
this little talk.

17:35.513 --> 17:39.381
I want you to remember
what we've done

17:39.475 --> 17:44.185
and what
we can still do together.

17:44.272 --> 17:47.515
(growling continues)

17:51.153 --> 17:53.315
(growling)

18:04.375 --> 18:09.040
I thought they killed you
and that you were gone, like--

18:09.130 --> 18:11.838
like that.

18:11.924 --> 18:16.509
I think it ginned me good,
ginned us all good.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.088
That they did this to you?

18:19.181 --> 18:23.550
That they did this to us?
No.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.635
I wasn't good with it.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.858
I lacked discipline.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.812
And I made it personal.

18:35.906 --> 18:40.946
And that's why I moved things
from infection to extermination

18:41.037 --> 18:42.778
at the Hilltop.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.739
Yes...

18:45.833 --> 18:49.292
things went bad.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.962
Though I think it's possible
we may have found ourselves

18:53.049 --> 18:55.131
in a similar
tactical situation,

18:55.217 --> 18:56.582
regardless of approach.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.133
We don't know that.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.929
So I'll own it.

19:03.476 --> 19:08.266
I just ask that you give me
a pass on this one.

19:08.356 --> 19:11.064
I'll make it up to you.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.232
I promise you that.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.188
(chuckles)

19:18.282 --> 19:21.400
You know, I remember
when I took this place.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.701
(grunts)

19:27.500 --> 19:31.789
When you helped me
take this place.

19:31.879 --> 19:35.622
Wasn't sure I wanted
to keep you on board.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.627
I mean, before me,

19:37.718 --> 19:40.085
before there was
a system in place,

19:40.179 --> 19:45.219
what you did,
killing all those men,

19:45.309 --> 19:48.518
those boys in that settlement
so long ago,

19:48.604 --> 19:50.436
a lot of people
would think

19:50.523 --> 19:54.232
that is some psychotic shit.

19:54.318 --> 19:58.653
Like that is the work
of a demented,

19:58.739 --> 20:01.697
broken,
goddamn ghoul.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.991
Like that's not someone
that you want to work with,

20:04.078 --> 20:07.571
let alone stand next to.

20:07.665 --> 20:11.454
So I figured
I'd keep my eye on you.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.455
And I did.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.254
And everything
seemed to work out

20:16.340 --> 20:19.549
right up until this point.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.141
I'm gonna need you
on your knees.

20:51.584 --> 20:55.122
You gonna make a move,
or is that it?

20:59.884 --> 21:03.297
No move to make.

21:03.387 --> 21:06.095
No.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.298
There isn't.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.933
All is forgiven.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.769
Get your ass up.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.025
We're good.

21:35.169 --> 21:38.127
I won't let you down.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.830
Not you.

21:39.924 --> 21:43.007
I appreciate the hell
out of that.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.145
This is where we start--

21:56.232 --> 21:58.644
the first
of our new staging posts.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.567
See, we do not have to take
the Hilltop.

22:01.654 --> 22:05.192
We just have to make sure
that the farmers can't leave.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.148
We stay nimble. We stay light.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.825
We plink their asses

22:08.911 --> 22:11.573
every time one of them
tries to poke their head out.

22:11.664 --> 22:15.578
Sometimes right in front,
sometimes from a mile away,

22:15.668 --> 22:19.662
but every goddamn time.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.837
From here on out,

22:21.924 --> 22:26.839
it is death by a thousand cuts
to these assholes.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.717
War of attrition.

22:29.807 --> 22:32.390
Attrition?

22:32.476 --> 22:33.682
Piece by piece.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.760
(chuckles)

22:35.855 --> 22:38.267
(sighs)

22:38.357 --> 22:39.813
Tomorrow afternoon,

22:39.900 --> 22:43.188
I am going to take
a 10-head team to this spot.

22:43.279 --> 22:46.112
I am stocking it
with supplies and ammo

22:46.198 --> 22:49.111
that Dr. Smartypants are making.

22:49.201 --> 22:53.536
Everyone else here
is gonna do the same thing,

22:53.622 --> 22:56.080
same time, different spot.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.533
End of day tomorrow,
we will have cache after cache

22:58.627 --> 23:00.334
around that Hilltop

23:00.421 --> 23:04.460
and always be spitting distance
from a reload.

23:04.550 --> 23:09.135
There will be teams
24/7 around that place...

23:09.221 --> 23:13.135
snipin' them,
one by one, day after day,

23:13.225 --> 23:16.343
until we have full...

23:16.437 --> 23:18.223
attrition.

23:18.314 --> 23:22.308
If you feel
this is the correct course,

23:22.401 --> 23:24.768
it's the course we'll tread.

23:24.862 --> 23:29.151
It's an ambitious plan
with testicular heft,

23:29.241 --> 23:31.983
I'll give you that.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.160
Very happy to have you back,
boss man.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.579
Damn good to be back.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.374
All right, everybody,
clear out.

23:40.461 --> 23:42.919
Except for you, Dwight.

23:43.005 --> 23:46.498
Got a few things
we need to kick around.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.925
(door closes)

24:00.648 --> 24:03.766
You have anything
you want to tell me?

24:06.236 --> 24:08.227
I don't think so.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.819
Are you sure?

24:17.289 --> 24:19.155
Yeah.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.661
100 percent.

24:25.047 --> 24:28.085
(chuckles)

24:28.175 --> 24:29.757
Oh, you are smart as hell.

24:29.843 --> 24:33.006
You know that?

24:33.097 --> 24:34.178
I mean, after everything--

24:34.264 --> 24:38.724
after Sherry and the sizzle...

24:38.811 --> 24:42.145
you didn't stew,
you didn't do anything stupid.

24:42.231 --> 24:46.270
You just went about the business
of getting yours.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.732
Nothing shook you.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.734
You kept your eyes

24:52.825 --> 24:56.363
on what could keep you
alive and well.

24:59.415 --> 25:04.251
You keep on
keeping that shit clear.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.751
(sighs)

25:17.850 --> 25:21.388
(door opens)

25:36.493 --> 25:38.484
(grunts)

25:46.712 --> 25:48.123
Hello.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.624
We need to talk.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.959
You need to eat.

25:55.054 --> 25:59.139
So here's some dried fish,
black walnuts, and water.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.555
It's yours if you leave

26:00.642 --> 26:02.553
and promise me
that you'll never come back.

26:04.146 --> 26:07.104
I can't do that.

26:07.191 --> 26:08.647
But thanks.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.278
What that tells me, though,

26:14.364 --> 26:17.527
is you don't want
people to die.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.450
Same as me.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.324
Same reason why we all
need to fight the Saviors.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.451
We're not fighting.

26:28.879 --> 26:31.166
In that case...

26:31.256 --> 26:36.001
how about
I make you an offer?

26:36.095 --> 26:39.008
I'll eat...
if you invite me inside,

26:39.098 --> 26:42.090
and we can all just...
talk.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.636
No.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.596
You're gonna get sick.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.647
Or starve or worse.

26:50.734 --> 26:54.102
No.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.608
I'm gonna
change your mind.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.991
(scoffs)

27:06.542 --> 27:08.533
I'm aware that,
under the circumstances,

27:08.627 --> 27:12.040
I can never expect
to regain your respect.

27:12.131 --> 27:17.717
Or your trust
or your friendship.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.385
And in case
it wasn't readily apparent,

27:19.471 --> 27:20.882
I have no loyalty
to the Saviors.

27:20.973 --> 27:24.216
I'm loyal only
to my continued survival,

27:24.309 --> 27:27.142
a lone wolf, as it were.

27:27.229 --> 27:28.936
And, therefore,
now that I am in your custody,

27:29.022 --> 27:32.811
I will work just as hard for you
as I ever did.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.359
I can't help but suspect

27:35.445 --> 27:39.063
that the reason I'm being taken
alive is, despite...

27:39.158 --> 27:42.651
what completely warranted
bad blood exists between us,

27:42.744 --> 27:44.655
you still harbor
a vestigial nostalgia

27:44.746 --> 27:46.578
for our
erstwhile camaraderie.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.871
And in light of that,

27:47.958 --> 27:49.869
I'm willing
to just shut my grub flap

27:49.960 --> 27:51.667
and give you your space

27:51.753 --> 27:54.666
until you see such a time as
you're ready to break the ice,

27:54.756 --> 27:56.246
one traveling companion--

27:56.341 --> 27:58.878
Shut your mouth
before I cut your tongue out!

27:58.969 --> 28:00.209
All right!

28:01.305 --> 28:03.296
We got to keep going.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.472
They have to be
out looking for him by now.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.733
- Thank you. I--
- Shut up.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.567
- Let's go.
- (grunts)

28:22.910 --> 28:25.493
You helped us,
but you never cared about us.

28:25.579 --> 28:28.788
You're not a "lone wolf,"
you're a parasite.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.582
Well, technically,
that relationship

28:31.668 --> 28:32.954
would better be described
as symbiotic

28:33.045 --> 28:34.035
as opposed to parasitic,

28:34.129 --> 28:35.415
in that there
was mutual benefit involved.

28:35.505 --> 28:36.540
Knowledge for safety.

28:36.632 --> 28:38.293
What the hell
is wrong with you?

28:38.383 --> 28:39.794
How can you talk about
everything we've been through

28:39.885 --> 28:42.673
like it was some kind
of science experiment?

28:42.763 --> 28:45.380
We weren't just your friends,
we were family.

28:45.474 --> 28:46.464
And then you just
turn on us,

28:46.558 --> 28:48.515
like we meant nothing to you.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.930
When I told Negan
I made the bullet,

28:54.024 --> 28:56.015
it was to save your life.

28:57.319 --> 29:00.528
I didn't think.
I just acted on your behalf.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.696
And I fully expected
the crack of the bat

29:02.783 --> 29:03.944
to be the last thing I heard,

29:04.034 --> 29:06.321
but that didn't happen.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.153
And then I thought
they would torture me.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.034
But they didn't.

29:12.334 --> 29:14.996
They gave me
a chance to live.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.169
And I tried to resist.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.167
I tried to rise above
my biological imperative,

29:19.258 --> 29:20.589
but that is not who I am.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.166
I know who you are.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.548
You're the reason they were able
to escape the Sanctuary.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.549
Everything that's happened
since then,

29:26.640 --> 29:28.847
everyone who's died,
that's on you.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.482
Rick's the one who pushed us all
to take the Saviors on.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.354
He's the one

29:40.445 --> 29:42.186
who jumped headlong into
this shit-storm with no waders.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.363
(gasps)

29:44.449 --> 29:46.611
- (breathing heavily)
- You're selfish,

29:46.702 --> 29:49.990
and you're a coward,
and you're a traitor.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.287
You turned you back on
the only friends you ever had.

29:52.374 --> 29:53.956
Shooting you in the head
right here

29:54.042 --> 29:56.249
would actually make the world
a better place.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.002
But we're not gonna kill you,

30:02.092 --> 30:03.833
not because
we give a rat's ass about you.

30:03.927 --> 30:05.713
We just need
what's in there!

30:07.806 --> 30:09.922
We're gonna stick you in
the darkest hole we can find,

30:10.017 --> 30:11.803
and the only time
you'll see the light of day

30:11.893 --> 30:14.476
is when we need you
to teach us how to do something.

30:17.024 --> 30:18.606
So don't worry--
you'll get what you want.

30:18.692 --> 30:20.023
You'll live.

30:20.110 --> 30:23.023
But we're gonna force you
to do something useful

30:23.113 --> 30:25.400
with your pathetic life.

30:44.134 --> 30:46.341
(knock on door)

30:49.931 --> 30:52.719
(knock on door)

30:59.232 --> 31:01.314
(Pounding on door)

31:05.572 --> 31:08.189
(scoffs)
Meeting went well.

31:08.283 --> 31:11.275
Status quo
has been re-achieved.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.782
What'd he hold you back for?

31:13.872 --> 31:17.081
You know, a...
pep talk.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.909
Mm.
We need to talk.

31:20.003 --> 31:23.086
A serious talk with the others

31:23.173 --> 31:26.541
who are less than thrilled
with the current management,

31:26.635 --> 31:28.967
who, like you,
engaged in activity

31:29.054 --> 31:30.544
said management
would frown on.

31:30.639 --> 31:33.051
Maybe we don't need to talk.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.382
Maybe we just go back
to how things were.

31:35.477 --> 31:37.059
No.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.887
We've crossed
some thresholds here, Dwight.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.096
We're transformed.

31:41.191 --> 31:43.808
You know
you can't ever go back.

31:55.580 --> 31:59.869
- So this is it?
- You deliver or get shipped.

32:02.587 --> 32:07.002
He hasn't delivered,
and that saddens me.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.175
But the time has come.

32:10.262 --> 32:14.597
Let us gather
our like-minded individuals,

32:14.683 --> 32:17.675
draw strength
from each other...

32:17.769 --> 32:20.261
and do
what we need to do.

32:22.524 --> 32:24.185
Come on.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.358
I gotta sell this to you?

32:26.445 --> 32:28.607
Think about everything
he's done to you,

32:28.697 --> 32:30.608
every little indignity,

32:30.699 --> 32:33.031
everything he's extracted
from you.

32:33.118 --> 32:36.327
Think about it, Dwight!
You know what you have to do.

32:38.582 --> 32:42.120
You have to meet us
in the courtyard after rounds,

32:42.210 --> 32:44.042
and we begin what's next.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.712
I mean, Jesus, right?

32:52.929 --> 32:54.886
Right.

32:58.101 --> 33:01.219
<i>Yes. m'! “W-</i>

33:01.313 --> 33:03.429
Yes.

33:10.155 --> 33:13.068
(door opens, closes)

33:38.308 --> 33:43.178
(walkers growling)

33:47.442 --> 33:49.479
They must've
heard us pull up.

33:49.569 --> 33:51.185
I got it.

33:51.279 --> 33:54.397
Watch him.
(growling continues)

33:55.534 --> 33:56.649
(body thuds)

33:56.743 --> 33:58.609
(growling continues)

34:04.793 --> 34:06.375
(growling continues)

34:06.461 --> 34:14.460
(crossbow fires, body thuds)

34:24.396 --> 34:26.808
(gags)

34:31.485 --> 34:33.318
Shit.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.818
(grunting)

34:38.409 --> 34:40.321
(gunshots)

34:48.545 --> 34:50.411
He couldn't have got far.

34:50.505 --> 34:51.745
Come on.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.172
We can't let him
get back to them!

34:54.259 --> 34:57.092
If you see him,
blow that pig's head off!

35:22.829 --> 35:25.070
(grunting)

35:25.165 --> 35:28.408
(walkers growling)

35:37.886 --> 35:40.469
(walker growling)

35:44.059 --> 35:46.266
(grunting)

35:51.358 --> 35:54.441
(walkers growling)

35:56.488 --> 35:59.697
(grunting)

36:07.332 --> 36:10.620
(grunting)

36:13.880 --> 36:16.497
(panting)

36:16.591 --> 36:19.834
(walkers growling)

36:27.727 --> 36:29.934
Oh, God.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.934
(growling continues)

36:45.745 --> 36:48.863
(grunting)

36:48.957 --> 36:51.039
Aah!

36:51.126 --> 36:53.493
(growling continues)

36:56.214 --> 36:58.000
(grunts)

36:58.091 --> 37:01.629
(growling continues)

37:01.720 --> 37:05.884
(branch thudding)

37:08.977 --> 37:12.311
(panting)

37:19.988 --> 37:21.524
Rachel:
Is he dead?

37:21.614 --> 37:25.027
(thunder rumbles)

37:38.590 --> 37:41.173
You...

37:41.259 --> 37:44.342
You blamed Enid...

37:44.429 --> 37:48.172
for Natania's death.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.507
But it's really the Saviors.

37:50.602 --> 37:54.937
What they did to you,
what they turned you into...

37:55.023 --> 37:56.934
it's their fault.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.936
You hide.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.189
You don't trust.

38:01.279 --> 38:06.274
You don't live the life the way
you want to because of them.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.734
They hurt you,

38:08.828 --> 38:12.662
and they're gonna
keep on hurting you.

38:14.209 --> 38:18.203
Unless you do one thing!

38:18.296 --> 38:20.253
Fight.

38:35.814 --> 38:39.523
(walkers growling)

38:43.071 --> 38:45.483
(door opens)

38:50.537 --> 38:52.995
H9)!-

38:53.081 --> 38:54.992
Some shit, huh?

38:55.083 --> 38:57.700
Yeah.

38:59.087 --> 39:01.419
Got to think, uh...

39:01.506 --> 39:03.873
you wanted this
before we did.

39:05.260 --> 39:08.844
(growling continues)

39:22.402 --> 39:26.817
If you're here right now,
you're in.

39:26.906 --> 39:32.618
We can talk about approaches
and finesses, but you are in.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.116
No takebacks.

39:40.128 --> 39:44.622
We need to make this quick,
quiet, and respectful.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.832
Man's done a lot for us.

39:46.926 --> 39:49.338
He deserves that.

39:49.429 --> 39:52.296
(growling continues)

39:52.390 --> 39:55.132
We had a lot of good times.

39:55.226 --> 39:59.311
A lot of hills taken.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.637
But this all happened

40:00.732 --> 40:03.224
because he didn't know
when to cut bait.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.810
But we did.

40:05.904 --> 40:09.238
We do.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.736
(growling continues)

40:11.826 --> 40:14.113
You...

40:14.203 --> 40:18.618
have some legitimate
personal issues with the man.

40:18.708 --> 40:21.120
The kill is yours
if you want it.

40:21.210 --> 40:22.621
Something quiet.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.703
I mean, not a knife.

40:24.797 --> 40:25.958
(chuckles)

40:26.049 --> 40:28.541
Can't make it that personal.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.672
A silencer.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.884
We call a meeting.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.137
And that's it.

40:38.227 --> 40:42.141
The next order of business
is to set the break,

40:42.231 --> 40:43.721
to start the healing.

40:43.816 --> 40:46.729
The catalyzing event
to facilitate that

40:46.819 --> 40:50.562
is the destruction of
the Hilltop and its residents.

40:50.657 --> 40:53.900
We'll make it
a monument of compliance.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.324
Sorry, Gregvfy-

40:55.411 --> 40:58.699
And then...

40:58.790 --> 41:01.578
we get on with our lives.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.659
Right, Dwight?

41:03.753 --> 41:07.087
(growling continues)

41:07.632 --> 41:10.124
(Negan whistles)

41:10.218 --> 41:14.212
(whistling continues)

41:19.060 --> 41:22.178
(sighs)
Thank you, D.

41:22.271 --> 41:24.512
I'll take it from here.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.729
Three...

41:32.824 --> 41:35.191
two...

41:35.284 --> 41:36.820
one.

41:37.787 --> 41:38.902
(silenced gunshots)

41:56.055 --> 41:57.170
Dwight!

41:57.265 --> 42:00.508
(groans)

42:03.688 --> 42:08.023
Now there is the Simon
that I know.

42:08.109 --> 42:13.229
He comes right at you instead
of that backstabby bullshit.

42:13.322 --> 42:15.233
Why?

42:15.324 --> 42:17.531
After everything
he did to you, huh?

42:17.618 --> 42:20.531
Why do this?

42:20.621 --> 42:23.033
He'd win.

42:27.545 --> 42:32.665
You killed
all the garbage people, Simon.

42:32.759 --> 42:33.920
(Lucille thuds)

42:34.010 --> 42:36.047
(grunts)

42:36.137 --> 42:41.007
After I specifically told you
not to do that shit.

42:43.227 --> 42:44.717
(grunts, Lucille thuds)

42:44.812 --> 42:49.522
I got a sneakin' suspicion
that you were hopin' I was dead...

42:49.609 --> 42:50.724
(grunts, Lucille thuds)

42:50.818 --> 42:54.527
when Rick kamikazed
that convoy.

42:55.740 --> 42:56.946
(sighs)

42:57.033 --> 42:59.240
And the Hilltop?

42:59.327 --> 43:01.113
Yeah.

43:01.204 --> 43:02.365
(grunts, Lucille thuds)

43:02.455 --> 43:04.742
All is not forgiven.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.331
But...

43:11.422 --> 43:15.461
after all this,
and me being me...

43:18.012 --> 43:20.549
I'm still gonna give you
your shot.

43:29.482 --> 43:33.350
You want to be the man,
you got to beat the man.

43:33.444 --> 43:36.357
If you can do that...

43:36.447 --> 43:38.313
then,heH...

43:38.407 --> 43:41.365
you should be the man.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.850
Simon: Everyone!

44:07.937 --> 44:12.181
After this is done,
we get to work.

44:14.068 --> 44:17.606
Just know
that I didn't want this.

44:17.697 --> 44:21.531
But the Sanctuary must stand.

44:23.661 --> 44:29.327
This is not the man
to prosecute this conflict.

44:29.417 --> 44:32.000
Just wanted to say...

44:32.086 --> 44:34.418
a grateful enclave--

44:34.505 --> 44:35.586
unh!-- thanks you!

44:35.673 --> 44:38.665
(grunts)

44:38.759 --> 44:44.505
(both grunting)

44:51.772 --> 44:54.935
(punches landing)

44:55.026 --> 44:57.859
(both grunting)

44:57.945 --> 45:01.313
(groans)

45:12.335 --> 45:15.248
(both grunting)

45:39.654 --> 45:41.486
You need
to get out of here now.

45:41.572 --> 45:43.483
No shit.

45:43.574 --> 45:44.860
Give this to Rick

45:44.951 --> 45:47.192
and tell him
about tomorrow.

45:47.286 --> 45:49.493
It's the only move
you got.

45:49.580 --> 45:52.288
I left a car for you
behind the coal chutes.

45:52.375 --> 45:54.412
Go.

45:59.507 --> 46:02.374
You went for it all
at the Hilltop.

46:02.468 --> 46:04.505
You got Saviors killed,

46:04.595 --> 46:07.087
and then you ran away
like a coward!

46:07.181 --> 46:11.266
You got shown up
one too many times.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.093
Those people,
they are always gonna know

46:13.187 --> 46:16.521
that there's a loophole,
a way to skate.

46:16.607 --> 46:20.521
They are always gonna be looking
for that chance to push back,

46:20.611 --> 46:23.524
so now
I gotta kill all of 'em

46:23.614 --> 46:26.026
just like
I'm gonna kill you!

46:26.117 --> 46:27.824
(choking)

46:27.910 --> 46:29.901
(windpipe cracks)

46:29.996 --> 46:31.532
(grunts)

46:31.622 --> 46:33.363
(panting)

46:55.563 --> 46:57.850
What an asshole.

47:20.796 --> 47:24.380
(chains rattling, lock clicks)

47:40.441 --> 47:43.229
What're we gonna do?

47:49.784 --> 47:52.401
Such a damn shame--
a waste--

47:52.495 --> 47:56.614
slinking behind my back
like some kind of dickless worm.

47:56.707 --> 47:58.823
Planning on killing me...

47:58.918 --> 48:00.625
Like,
what else am I gonna do

48:00.711 --> 48:03.624
besides crush the guy's throat?

48:03.714 --> 48:05.625
Yeah.

48:05.716 --> 48:07.047
Eh, you know,

48:07.134 --> 48:10.422
what's bad for Simon,
it's good for you.

48:10.513 --> 48:13.221
And I know we've had
our ups and downs, D,

48:13.307 --> 48:16.220
but I've always been able
to count on you.

48:16.310 --> 48:18.221
So...

48:18.312 --> 48:19.848
congratulations.

48:19.939 --> 48:22.852
You are
my new right-hand man.

48:22.942 --> 48:25.434
That is,
if you accept the promotion.

48:25.528 --> 48:28.236
I do.

48:28.322 --> 48:31.235
And I'll help you
finish this thing with Rick.

48:31.325 --> 48:34.238
Don't sell yourself short,
D.

48:34.328 --> 48:36.410
You already have.

48:52.555 --> 48:58.267
Well, you look surprised,
Dwight.

48:58.352 --> 49:02.016
Yeah, see, I found her
on the side of the road.

49:02.106 --> 49:06.065
Laura, why don't you tell D
what you told me?

49:06.152 --> 49:09.690
That night in Alexandria,
he turned on us.

49:09.780 --> 49:12.693
He killed our team.

49:12.783 --> 49:15.275
I ran,
and I kept on running.

49:15.369 --> 49:16.905
I was hurt.

49:16.996 --> 49:18.282
But what kept me alive

49:18.372 --> 49:19.703
was the thought
of getting back here

49:19.790 --> 49:23.203
and exposing you
for the scum weasel you are.

49:28.382 --> 49:30.919
(chuckles)

49:31.010 --> 49:34.128
It all makes sense now.

49:34.221 --> 49:38.089
You told Rick when to attack.

49:38.184 --> 49:40.846
How to get
to the outposts...

49:40.936 --> 49:44.474
You keep us locked in here,

49:44.565 --> 49:47.523
slipping them workers guns.

49:47.610 --> 49:51.319
Maybe you even lied to me
about killing Sherry.

49:51.405 --> 49:54.113
Oh, hell.

49:54.200 --> 49:58.159
You, for sure,
lied to me about that.

49:58.245 --> 50:00.953
So, what? Hmm?

50:01.040 --> 50:04.954
You think you're some sort
of a (inhales sharply) hero?

50:05.044 --> 50:07.957
No.
You are nothing.

50:08.047 --> 50:11.540
A nobody
in way over your head.

50:11.634 --> 50:13.545
But when I said

50:13.636 --> 50:15.877
that you would come through
for me when I needed it,

50:15.971 --> 50:19.839
oh, I meant that 110%.

50:19.934 --> 50:21.971
See, I knew
that I could count on you

50:22.061 --> 50:23.768
to deliver my plan
to Rick,

50:23.854 --> 50:27.142
my brilliant,
if I do say so myself,

50:27.233 --> 50:29.019
fake-ass plan.

50:29.109 --> 50:31.976
(sighs)

50:32.071 --> 50:35.780
You used Gregory
for that, right?

50:35.866 --> 50:37.732
I mean, I was thinking

50:37.826 --> 50:39.988
maybe you'd take some kind of
field trip or something, but...

50:40.079 --> 50:43.788
no, you got yourself
a little delivery boy.

50:43.874 --> 50:45.364
Good for you.

50:45.459 --> 50:47.791
To deliver
all that intel to Rick

50:47.878 --> 50:49.494
and the piss patrol

50:49.588 --> 50:52.546
that's gonna lead them
directly into the line of fire.

50:52.633 --> 50:56.171
They are not gonna know
what hit 'em,

50:56.262 --> 51:01.928
aHthanks
to my new right-hand man.

51:03.561 --> 51:05.097
(lips squeak)

51:05.187 --> 51:08.179
Now, see, I-- I thought about
killing you, and then...

51:08.274 --> 51:09.764
(inhales sharply)

51:09.858 --> 51:13.396
I thought maybe that'd be
too dignified for a...

51:13.487 --> 51:18.573
backstabbing, double-crossing
dirtbag such as yourself.

51:20.703 --> 51:27.416
No, Dwighty boy,
I got plans for you.

51:30.713 --> 51:32.420
(chuckles)

51:37.928 --> 51:42.593
(tools clanging)

51:42.683 --> 51:44.845
What the hell happened?

51:44.935 --> 51:47.643
We need preparations
to defend this place

51:47.730 --> 51:49.312
in case
of another incursion.

51:49.398 --> 51:50.934
We've established
a perimeter.

51:51.025 --> 51:53.392
We just got a message
from the Sanctuary.

51:53.485 --> 51:54.771
Negan's back,

51:54.862 --> 51:56.478
and he has plans
to finish the Hilltop.

51:56.572 --> 51:58.233
Rick's walking into a trap.

51:58.324 --> 52:01.316
We'll need that bullet order
filled by tomorrow morning.

52:11.211 --> 52:12.747
Kindly convey to Negan

52:12.838 --> 52:15.705
my personal congratulations
on the occasion of his return,

52:15.799 --> 52:17.881
and assure him
that his request

52:17.968 --> 52:21.552
will be fulfilled
in its entirety and on time.

52:26.268 --> 52:28.009
That's right.

52:28.103 --> 52:30.686
If Negan needs bullets
to end this war,

52:30.773 --> 52:32.684
then, by ginger,
he's gonna get 'em.

52:32.775 --> 52:33.936
All of 'em.

52:34.026 --> 52:36.267
Scotch my talk
of a bare minimum.

52:36.362 --> 52:37.898
No, sirs and madams,

52:37.988 --> 52:40.901
we shall rise to the occasion
with the ammunition.

52:40.991 --> 52:44.905
We will blow them away with
every trigger pull they require.

52:44.995 --> 52:48.909
We shall, we will.

52:48.999 --> 52:52.492
Oh, trip not, colleagues.

52:52.586 --> 52:56.750
We will change
Savior history evermore.

53:00.803 --> 53:03.670
Gabriel.

53:03.764 --> 53:06.301
It's all hands
on deck,

53:06.392 --> 53:09.510
and yours
are sorting shells.

53:09.603 --> 53:13.722
Listen, you follow my lead
to the letter on the lead,

53:13.816 --> 53:15.853
or you can cry and die.

53:21.990 --> 53:24.402
(fist pounds)

53:33.377 --> 53:34.867
Here we go.

53:34.962 --> 53:38.045
Time to do something useful
with our pathetic lives.

53:44.096 --> 53:47.430
(Simon growling)

53:52.938 --> 53:54.099
(walkie-talkie clicks)

53:54.189 --> 53:56.271
Michonne:
Negan, <i>it's</i> Michonne.

54:03.866 --> 54:06.073
(walkie-talkie clicks)
I'll <i>wait.</i>

54:10.581 --> 54:14.199
(walkie-talkie clicks)
The one with the dreads, the sword?

54:14.293 --> 54:16.204
Is that you?

54:16.295 --> 54:18.377
Rick there with you?

54:18.464 --> 54:20.922
Why don't you put him on?

54:21.008 --> 54:22.544
(walkie-talkie clicks)

54:22.634 --> 54:25.171
This isn't about Rick.
It's about Carl.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.799
(walkers growling)

54:27.890 --> 54:30.222
He wrote you a letter.

54:30.309 --> 54:34.018
And I'm delivering it
because that's what he wanted.

54:34.104 --> 54:37.392
(walkie-talkie clicks)

54:37.483 --> 54:40.316
Well, I can't promise
not to kill the messenger.

54:40.402 --> 54:41.767
(walkie-talkie clicks)

54:41.862 --> 54:44.103
(walkie-talkie clicks)
Just shut up and listen.

54:53.123 --> 54:54.409
(walkie-talkie clicks)

54:54.500 --> 54:57.288
"Negan, this is Carl."

55:00.422 --> 55:02.413
<i>"I was helping someone.</i>

55:02.508 --> 55:04.624
<i>I got bit.</i>

55:04.718 --> 55:07.631
<i>We didn't even have to be doing
what we were doing.</i>

55:07.721 --> 55:09.632
<i>I was just helping someone,</i>

55:09.723 --> 55:11.259
<i>and now I'm gone.</i>

55:11.350 --> 55:13.432
<i>You might be gone.</i>

55:13.519 --> 55:16.853
<i>Maybe my Dad made your people
give you up and he killed you,</i>

55:16.939 --> 55:20.182
<i>but I don't think so.</i>

55:20.275 --> 55:23.859
<i>I think you're still around
and you're working on a way out.</i>

55:23.946 --> 55:25.857
<i>Maybe you got out.</i>

55:25.948 --> 55:28.280
<i>Maybe you think
we're a lost cause</i>

55:28.367 --> 55:30.483
<i>and you just want
to kill all of us.</i>

55:30.577 --> 55:33.035
<i>I think you think
you have to be who you are.</i>

55:33.121 --> 55:36.785
I just wonder
if this is what you wanted.

55:36.875 --> 55:38.536
I wanted to ask you.

55:38.627 --> 55:42.495
<i>I wish I could've.</i>

55:42.589 --> 55:44.956
Maybe you'll beat us.

55:45.050 --> 55:48.759
And if you do, there'll just be
someone else to fight.

55:48.846 --> 55:51.804
<i>The way out is working together.</i>

55:51.890 --> 55:53.801
<i>It's forgiveness."</i>

55:56.353 --> 56:00.392
<i>"It's believing that it doesn't
have to be a fight anymore.</i>

56:00.482 --> 56:02.393
<i>Because it doesn't."</i>

56:04.486 --> 56:07.979
"I hope my dad offers you peace.

56:08.073 --> 56:10.405
I hope you take it.

56:10.492 --> 56:14.451
I hope everything can change.

56:14.538 --> 56:16.654
It did for me.

56:16.748 --> 56:18.614
Start over.

56:18.709 --> 56:21.792
<i>You still can.</i>

56:21.879 --> 56:23.995
<i>Carl."</i>

56:24.089 --> 56:28.003
(walkie-talkie clicks)

56:28.093 --> 56:30.425
All this...

56:30.512 --> 56:34.426
there is no
getting out of it now.

56:34.516 --> 56:37.474
I wouldn't
accept your surrender

56:37.561 --> 56:41.270
if you came to me
on your knees.

56:41.356 --> 56:44.815
See, winning isn't about
beating you.

56:44.902 --> 56:50.022
Winning is about killing
every last one of you.

56:50.115 --> 56:53.324
That is starting over.

56:55.871 --> 56:58.033
I never wanted this.

56:58.123 --> 57:01.832
Rick made this happen.

57:01.919 --> 57:04.286
You tell him that.

57:04.379 --> 57:06.495
No more talk.

57:06.590 --> 57:08.001
(walkie-talkie clicks)

57:19.686 --> 57:21.893
(theme music playing)
