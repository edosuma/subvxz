43:43.951 --> 43:46.579
And, of course, I was standing
on the fault, so that made it easier.

43:46.654 --> 43:50.181
- What instrumentation did you use?
- Just me.

43:50.257 --> 43:53.488
If you think that's something,
you should see him move stuff
with his brain.

43:53.560 --> 43:57.758
Nate! Never mind that. You see,
I felt the ultralow frequency waves.

43:57.831 --> 44:01.790
And they kind of made me dizzy
and nauseous, right? And
that's how I perceived all this.

44:01.869 --> 44:05.999
We've been studying quake
prediction for ten years.

44:06.073 --> 44:10.100
There's no record of any person
ever feeling the prequake activity.

44:10.177 --> 44:12.270
Now there is.

44:14.081 --> 44:17.278
We have some ULF equipment
in our labs.

44:17.351 --> 44:19.285
Could you come in
for an experiment?

44:19.353 --> 44:21.287
- Come to Berkeley?
- Yes.

44:21.355 --> 44:24.017
[ Laughs ]
Yes.

44:24.091 --> 44:26.821
Well, my department would like
to interview you and clear this up.

44:26.894 --> 44:30.091
I-I would be-- I would be
so glad to come to Berkeley.

44:30.164 --> 44:33.133
D-Do you think that I could meet with--
with some other departments as well?

44:33.200 --> 44:36.658
I-I have some experiments that
I'd like to show you. Come with me.

44:37.971 --> 44:40.405
They're nice.

44:42.042 --> 44:44.013
All right.
Well, uh, let's see.

44:44.146 --> 44:48.082
Um. Oh, oh, yes, here.
Okay, now, look, um--

44:48.150 --> 44:51.085
I've taken solar panels, and I've
actually germinated the seeds...

44:51.153 --> 44:53.314
th-that made these--
th-th-these plants grow.

44:53.389 --> 44:55.380
I'm trying to change the
electromagnetic field, right?

44:55.457 --> 44:58.620
- Uh, Mr.Malley?
- I took, uh, incandescent light...

44:58.694 --> 45:00.628
- Mr.Malley.
- and turned it into sunlight,

45:00.696 --> 45:02.630
which actually made these--
these plants grow.

45:02.698 --> 45:05.997
- Mr.Malley.
- Oh. Now look,
I-I-I took pig manure...

45:06.068 --> 45:10.027
and I turned it into a fuel, which I-I
believe will actually run an automobile.

45:10.105 --> 45:12.300
All I'm interested in
is the earthquake.

45:12.374 --> 45:15.366
We need to know
if that was a fluke.

45:15.444 --> 45:17.378
A coincidence.

45:17.446 --> 45:20.381
A fluke?

45:20.449 --> 45:23.577
George, why don't you move
something with your mind?

45:25.421 --> 45:29.084
Maybe move his, uh-- [ Mouthing Word ]
or something like that?

45:29.158 --> 45:31.456
- Look, Mr.Ringold.
- Doctor.

45:31.527 --> 45:33.552
D-Dr.Ringold, uh, look--
I--

45:33.629 --> 45:38.566
Look. I-- I've got-- I've
got my garden out there, and
that acts like a lab, right?

45:38.634 --> 45:40.568
- And I've got-- And I've got
everything that you see here.
- [ Vehicle Approaching ]

45:40.636 --> 45:43.196
- But I-- I really need to talk
to people like you, okay?
- [ Tito ] Hey, George!

45:43.272 --> 45:45.832
- [ Horn Honking ]
- [ Shouting ] George! Are you home?

45:45.908 --> 45:48.672
- Please don't go, okay?
Just please don't go.
- George, get out here!

45:48.744 --> 45:51.907
- [ Honking ]
- Hey, George!

45:51.980 --> 45:54.346
George! Doc says
you better come right now!

45:54.416 --> 45:57.647
- What's the matter?
- Come on, man! It's an emergency!

45:57.719 --> 46:00.017
You gotta learn how to talk Portuguese
on the way over there.

46:00.089 --> 46:02.557
I gotta go.

46:02.624 --> 46:04.489
Portuguese?

46:04.560 --> 46:09.190
- Learn Portuguese?
- Why don't you go along, Professor?

46:27.516 --> 46:30.883
George! Doc's inside.
He thinks it's food poisoning.

46:30.953 --> 46:32.887
[ Man ]
Hey, George.

46:33.956 --> 46:36.083
- Hey, Doc. George is here.
- [ Sighs ]

46:36.158 --> 46:38.092
He's gonna be fine, George,
but his grandson is missing.

46:38.160 --> 46:40.560
Now, if they ate the same thing,
the boy could be a lot worse off.

46:40.629 --> 46:42.893
- You brought the book?
- Yeah, I have it.

46:42.965 --> 46:46.059
Okay. Ask him
where the boy is.

46:46.135 --> 46:48.501
Onde esta o menino?

46:48.570 --> 46:51.403
- Va ao pomar.
- He's in orchard.
He said, 'He's in the orchard.'

46:51.473 --> 46:53.236
- Right. Okay.
- [ George ] Diga.

46:53.308 --> 46:56.334
[ Patient ]
Meu neto, Alberto.

46:56.411 --> 46:58.345
- Uma coisa que eu comi.
- Mmm.

46:58.413 --> 47:02.315
Eu tenho medo. Vao depressa achar
o Alberto. Depressa!

47:02.384 --> 47:05.478
He said that they ate something
bad, and he thinks the boy--
the boy is sick.

47:05.554 --> 47:09.615
Calma. Eles irao
encontrar o menino.

47:09.691 --> 47:14.151
O doutor vai dar uma coisa
para ficar melhor.

47:14.229 --> 47:16.527
Calma, calma.

47:16.598 --> 47:18.862
Obrigado. Obrigado.

47:24.206 --> 47:26.697
Tito drove the truck
while I-I read the book.

47:26.775 --> 47:31.303
George Malley! You learned
the Portuguese language in 20 minutes?

47:31.380 --> 47:34.747
Not all of it.

47:34.850 --> 47:37.375
- What are we lookin' for here? A kid?
- [ Tito ] What's the kid's name?

47:37.452 --> 47:40.615
- Alberto.
- Berto. Alberto. Yeah.

Now, let's spread out
and comb these-- comb these trees.

47:46.195 --> 47:48.288
- Everybody, let's go.
Look real careful.
- Okay.

- Call out his name.
- [ All Shouting ] Alberto!

Where are you, kid?

48:03.946 --> 48:06.574
Alberto? Wherever
you are, we're coming.

[ Moans ]

48:53.862 --> 48:55.921
George, what you got?

48:55.998 --> 48:58.330
- [ Moans ]
- Huh? What?

48:58.400 --> 49:00.925
- He's not in the orchard.
- Oh.

- He's sick, Doc.
- Oh.

- Oh. Ohh.
- [ Doc ] You okay, George?

It's not me, it's him.

Tell me where he is.

get up here fast.

Good work, George.

So is, uh, Wednesday
good for you? Say 2:00?

50:46.041 --> 50:48.532
- Sure, Wednesday is good.
- Should I send a car?

50:48.610 --> 50:50.544
No, no, John.
I'll get there on my own.

50:50.612 --> 50:52.876
And I'll have somebody
from solar energy there.

50:52.948 --> 50:57.681

- Yeah, automotive.

here earlier, huh?

for work, man.

a very special guy.

who found your son. Okay?

- Do you know what kind
of work she was lookin' for?

- All right, Nate.
- Thanks, George.

Portuguese food, George.

anything you want, Nate.

- Oh, a bit. But, uh--

- Yeah. You got a problem with that?

if that's gonna work, George.

52:45.694 --> 52:50.158

'Can you come twice a week?'

twice a week?

Ah, no, no, no.

I'm jumpin' out of my skin here.

They want to feel safe.

01:09:43.426 --> 01:09:45.724
They don't feel safe
with you out there.

01:09:45.795 --> 01:09:50.095
Whoa. Why would they? They've been
havin' me break codes all night.

01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:52.100

I mean-- There--

01:09:52.167 --> 01:09:54.898
I shouldn't be listening to a code
from Britain to Saudi Arabia.

These are our allies! I-If you guys
are gonna accuse me of a crime...

01:09:59.008 --> 01:10:02.375
or keep me here,
uh, I'll tell the press.

01:10:02.445 --> 01:10:04.879
Or I'll call London
or Riyadh.

capitals now, by the way.

My interest in Mr.Malley has to do
with seismology and geology.

01:10:16.259 --> 01:10:19.387
It has nothing to do
with security issues.

01:10:19.462 --> 01:10:22.920
Oh, I know. But that's
not the point. Mr.Malley has
been released without charges.

01:10:22.999 --> 01:10:26.230
But he is considered
a security risk.

01:10:26.302 --> 01:10:28.930
I'll be frank with you.
He's an unknown quantity.

01:10:29.005 --> 01:10:31.997
We'd feel better,
for the time being,

to the institutions...

- Yeah, well, they had no choice.

I am really sorry

01:12:38.501 --> 01:12:41.368
I told them everything, George.

01:12:41.437 --> 01:12:45.498
I told them everything
about you. Everything.

- You just think you're
not gonna be so scared.

and nobody gets fender benders.

It's a new route for her mail, okay?

gets their mail by 3:00.

with it, huh?

could get my life back together.

to do this operation, wouldn't
it most likely kill me...

and I just wanted to finish this up.

01:49:29.483 --> 01:49:33.579
- Finish what?
- Ah, just some possibilities.

01:49:35.756 --> 01:49:37.883
Hey, come sit by me.

01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:42.224
Hmm?

01:49:42.296 --> 01:49:44.264
You scared?

01:49:44.331 --> 01:49:46.356
No.

01:49:46.433 --> 01:49:49.630
I wish I knew
what you feel.

01:49:49.703 --> 01:49:54.367
Oh, you do.
You've always known it, Lace.

01:49:54.441 --> 01:49:56.739
I'll show you.

01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:59.540
When your children were babies,
how did you hold them?

01:49:59.613 --> 01:50:01.547
[ Chuckles ]

01:50:04.151 --> 01:50:08.815
And if they had a hard time sleeping
and you had to rock them to sleep,

01:50:08.889 --> 01:50:10.948
well, how did you do it?

01:50:31.178 --> 01:50:34.306
- [ Laughs ]
- See?

01:50:37.918 --> 01:50:41.264
Hey. Look what I made
back there.

01:50:42.265 --> 01:50:44.597
Ah, that looks like
a bed.

01:50:46.035 --> 01:50:48.094
Are you expecting
to get lucky?

01:50:48.170 --> 01:50:51.469
No. Just hoping.

01:51:00.116 --> 01:51:05.053
When the road gets dark

01:51:06.689 --> 01:51:10.318
You can no longer see

01:51:12.895 --> 01:51:15.125
Just let my love

01:51:15.197 --> 01:51:19.497
Throw a spark, baby

01:51:19.568 --> 01:51:23.766
And have a little faith in me

01:51:26.309 --> 01:51:31.406
And when the tears you cry

01:51:32.615 --> 01:51:38.281
Are all you can believe

01:51:38.354 --> 01:51:44.953
Just give these lovin' arms
a try, baby

01:51:45.027 --> 01:51:49.396
And have a little faith in me

01:51:49.465 --> 01:51:55.062
Have a little faith in me

01:51:56.138 --> 01:52:00.541
Have a little faith in me

01:52:02.345 --> 01:52:07.408
Have a little faith in me

01:52:08.751 --> 01:52:13.654
Have a little faith in me

01:52:24.834 --> 01:52:27.997
- Hey, I never kissed you there.
- Mm. No.

01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:30.004
- Keeping track?
- Mm-hmm.

01:52:36.412 --> 01:52:38.380
You going to sleep?

01:52:38.447 --> 01:52:41.575
Huh-uh.
Are you?

01:52:41.650 --> 01:52:46.144
No. And I don't want to sleep
unless you're sleeping.

01:52:46.222 --> 01:52:48.588
I don't want to--

01:52:55.398 --> 01:52:57.866
- Lace.
- What?

01:52:57.933 --> 01:53:02.336
- Sweetheart.
- What?

01:53:04.673 --> 01:53:07.039
Now, you have to listen to me now.

01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:09.043
What?

01:53:12.782 --> 01:53:14.716
It's happening.

01:53:14.784 --> 01:53:17.184
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

01:53:17.253 --> 01:53:20.086
No. Wait, George. Wait.

01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:25.117
- No.
- And it's gonna be okay.

01:53:26.195 --> 01:53:29.562
- George.
- It's okay.

01:53:29.632 --> 01:53:32.226
It's gonna be okay.

01:53:33.302 --> 01:53:35.236
Okay.

01:53:38.073 --> 01:53:42.567
- Good-bye, honey.
- No.

01:53:55.524 --> 01:53:57.458
Oh.

01:54:01.063 --> 01:54:02.997
Oh.

01:54:27.857 --> 01:54:31.588
Hello. I'm John Ringold.
I'm here to see George Malley.

01:54:33.829 --> 01:54:36.320
Oh! I'm sorry, John.

01:54:36.398 --> 01:54:40.027
George Malley
passed away last night.

01:54:41.437 --> 01:54:44.964
Wh--
I-I'm sorry.

01:54:50.713 --> 01:54:53.238
He left these for you.

01:54:57.753 --> 01:55:00.847
He said they're not finished.

01:55:00.923 --> 01:55:02.857
You'll have to do it.

01:55:07.229 --> 01:55:09.356
I'll do my best.

01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:13.800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:55:16.972 --> 01:55:21.136

01:56:11.694 --> 01:56:15.494
[ Wind Whistling ]

01:56:20.002 --> 01:56:21.936
[ Sighs ]

01:56:45.628 --> 01:56:47.562
Thank you, sweetie.

- [ Speaking Portuguese ]
- [ Chuckles ]

01:57:37.317 --> 01:57:40.150
- Nate, they'll be waiting for you.
- We're comin'. We're comin'.

01:57:44.123 --> 01:57:47.718
If I could reach the stars

01:57:49.062 --> 01:57:52.225
Pull one down for you

01:57:53.933 --> 01:57:56.959
Shine it on my heart

01:57:58.871 --> 01:58:02.898
So you could see the truth

01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:08.709
That this love
I have inside

01:58:08.781 --> 01:58:12.123
- Is everything it seems
- [ Nate ] Beautiful.

01:58:12.123 --> 01:58:12.612
- Is everything it seems
- [ Nate ] Beautiful.

01:58:13.757 --> 01:58:16.248
But for now I find

01:58:16.327 --> 01:58:19.592
- Whoo. Whoo.
- [ Speaking Portuguese ]

01:58:19.663 --> 01:58:22.655
- It's only in my dreams
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:58:22.733 --> 01:58:27.136
- But I can't change the world
- [ Jimmy ] Hey, Nate!

01:58:27.204 --> 01:58:31.504
- Hi, Ella!
- You look beautiful.
What am I gonna do with this?

01:58:31.575 --> 01:58:37.275
- What am I gonna do?
- You would think my love
was really something good

01:58:37.348 --> 01:58:40.545
- [ Everyone Chattering ]
- Baby, if you knew that I

01:58:40.618 --> 01:58:44.076
- Could change
- Not here.

01:58:44.155 --> 01:58:46.089
- The world
- It's not here.
Tell you where it is.

01:58:46.157 --> 01:58:49.786
- It's right there!
- How did you do that?

01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:52.328
- How did I do that? It's magic.
- [ Bonnie ] Good job.

01:58:52.396 --> 01:58:54.330
Can you hear her?
She just kicked.

01:58:54.398 --> 01:58:56.332
- [ Tito ] Baby, huh?
- Yeah.

01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:59.233
- Change the world
- Have a cold one.

01:58:59.303 --> 01:59:01.931
- You gettin' any rest?
- [ Sighs ] Not much.

01:59:02.006 --> 01:59:05.442
Well, get it now, because there's
no sleepin' once the baby gets here.

01:59:05.509 --> 01:59:09.468
- You would think my love
was really something good
- Check.

01:59:09.547 --> 01:59:12.778
Baby, if I could

01:59:12.850 --> 01:59:17.651
- Change
- Go on now. Think it through.
Think it through.

Ah, ah

I was thinkin' out loud

02:00:01.865 --> 02:00:06.768
One life's such a short time
for love

02:00:06.836 --> 02:00:11.170
When a match made in heaven
arrives

02:00:11.241 --> 02:00:15.337
Eternity is never enough

02:00:17.847 --> 02:00:20.975
I need to dance

02:00:21.051 --> 02:00:22.985

into the night

When there is no one else around

I will make every day count

And leave a brilliant light

how I feel

This special moment
I love you

02:01:15.271 --> 02:01:19.173
You seem to cover me up

02:01:19.242 --> 02:01:22.211
And hide me deep

02:01:22.278 --> 02:01:24.803
Deep in me

02:01:24.881 --> 02:01:28.339

02:01:42.365 --> 02:01:47.393
And make every second
your last

02:01:47.470 --> 02:01:51.839
And I'll touch you
A full moon shall wake you

02:01:51.908 --> 02:01:56.277
Make the most of the present
and the past

02:01:58.515 --> 02:02:01.609
I need to dance
