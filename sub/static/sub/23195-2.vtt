01:20.251 --> 01:22.397
Am I getting through to you, Brian D.?

01:22.347 --> 01:23.998
Huh? Oh. Uh...

01:23.998 --> 01:25.826
Yes sir. Straight through.

01:25.826 --> 01:28.096
I swear, every year it's the same damn cutscene.

01:28.096 --> 01:30.500
Some media darling with a five-second kill reel

01:30.500 --> 01:33.367
breezes into school on a golden ticket.

01:34.489 --> 01:37.989
Buckle up, kid. Cuz this ticket puts you on a plane straight to hell.

01:37.989 --> 01:39.884
And the in-flight movie?

01:39.984 --> 01:41.385
Super hell.

01:43.307 --> 01:46.382
Understood, sir. I know it will be rough here, but...

01:46.344 --> 01:48.563
I did get some practice at the Milwaukee Invitational, so...

01:48.662 --> 01:50.162
Oh, really?

01:54.793 --> 01:57.018
Still feeling cocky, Mr. Milwaukee?

01:56.977 --> 01:59.777
You're the lowest-ranked player in the school!

01:59.772 --> 02:02.548
Well I should probably go get some practice then...

02:03.328 --> 02:07.478
And as for you, Ki Swan. I don't care what game your parents developed.

02:07.822 --> 02:09.502
What the frag are you doing?

02:09.981 --> 02:12.757
Well sir, you cut such an imposing figure

02:12.951 --> 02:14.901
I thought I'd make a game about you.

02:20.068 --> 02:21.043
Haha, awesome!

02:21.769 --> 02:23.169
What are my moves?

02:29.368 --> 02:31.343
Calhoun always wins.

02:31.544 --> 02:32.394
Acceptable.

02:32.943 --> 02:34.268
Now scram, you scrubs.

02:34.414 --> 02:35.728
Ah, don't we get a welcome buddy?

02:35.729 --> 02:38.954
Cool your jets, Miss Swan! I was just getting to that.

02:40.192 --> 02:43.367
Your orientation guide is...

02:45.033 --> 02:48.933
Jenny Matrix. 5,031 points. JV FPS captain.

02:49.085 --> 02:50.485
You must be pretty nervous.

02:50.849 --> 02:55.025
Of course I'm nervous. Did you see her 1080 no-scope NattyICE?

03:08.274 --> 03:10.498
Hahaha, not even close, son!

03:11.383 --> 03:12.783
Who's next?

03:12.962 --> 03:15.763
But don't worry. I've got a secret weapon.

03:17.957 --> 03:19.082
Hey, Jenny.

03:19.191 --> 03:21.415
Nice moves. I'm Brian D.

03:21.140 --> 03:23.240
Ahh, Mr. Law-killer, huh.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.040
You saw that?

03:25.591 --> 03:27.411
I mean-- yes. I am.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.765
ColdTurkey, get Brian D. here a drink.

03:30.038 --> 03:31.043
What? No! I--

03:31.141 --> 03:32.262
Who's Brian D., the kid with the lame hat?

03:32.549 --> 03:36.274
Lame hat? Only cool hats for this noggin.

03:36.348 --> 03:38.024
I guess that's cool...

03:39.049 --> 03:41.149
Hey, check out the cool kid with the cool hat!

03:45.010 --> 03:47.786
Hey, sweet hat, frosh!

03:48.816 --> 03:50.381
The name's Games...

03:50.631 --> 03:51.756
Games Dean.

03:54.031 --> 03:55.431
So cool.

03:57.854 --> 03:59.957
Brian, your secret weapon seems to have misfired.

03:59.957 --> 04:02.733
Hey! Come on, we doin' this or what, D.?

04:02.733 --> 04:07.432
Oh! No, I'm not here to fight. You're our welcome buddy.

04:09.133 --> 04:13.283
What? She's supposed to show us around and... stuff.

04:13.557 --> 04:16.608
Alright, sorry guys. Duty calls.

04:16.747 --> 04:18.146
Let's go.

04:33.202 --> 04:36.252
And this concludes your tour of VGHS.

04:36.802 --> 04:38.752
You took us in a straight line and said nothing.

04:38.752 --> 04:41.527
Hey, Jenny doesn't have time to show us noobs around.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.855
She's got the whole JV team to worry about.

04:44.129 --> 04:44.980
Speaking of which...

04:44.985 --> 04:47.785
Give me five reasons I should put you on my team.

04:49.685 --> 04:52.485
That was pretty transparent, wasn't it...?

04:52.685 --> 04:54.085
Yeah, a bit.

04:56.286 --> 04:59.086
Reason number one, I'm honest to a fault!

04:59.456 --> 05:01.956
You probably shouldn't list one of your faults as a reason.

05:02.255 --> 05:04.205
It's okay, Ki, she's gone.

05:04.206 --> 05:06.980
Wait, that's not okay, I don't know where my room is!

05:06.706 --> 05:09.506
Seriously, guys, fun's over, right?

05:09.480 --> 05:11.300
What's wrong, baby Wong?

05:11.156 --> 05:13.105
Thought you rockstars knew how to party.

05:12.922 --> 05:15.422
Yeah, totally, Annihilist! Totally, yeah!

05:15.146 --> 05:16.546
Okay, you guys got me.

05:19.846 --> 05:21.666
Oh, hey! Ted Wong.

05:22.221 --> 05:25.085
Ki Swan. 1360 points. Fighter.

05:25.136 --> 05:27.086
Welcome to the Frag Floor, Ki--

05:27.911 --> 05:29.730
Hey, leave him alone.

05:31.235 --> 05:33.336
What're you gonna do about it?

05:33.735 --> 05:35.135
Stop us?

05:35.411 --> 05:38.185
Nope. You're not.

05:38.526 --> 05:40.225
Brian, maybe we should get the R.A.

05:40.201 --> 05:42.301
Did your girlfriend just get here?

05:42.151 --> 05:44.376
This loser is the R.A.

05:44.401 --> 05:45.526
Are you really his girlfriend? Because--

05:46.076 --> 05:47.196
Nice.

05:47.750 --> 05:48.600
What do we got here?

05:48.875 --> 05:50.695
Hey, give that back!

05:51.100 --> 05:51.951
What's this?

05:51.475 --> 05:53.576
I don't know. Something stupid.

05:53.574 --> 05:54.694
Chiba?

05:55.550 --> 05:59.700
Hanzo? Where'd you get this, the poor store?

05:59.975 --> 06:02.201
Where'd you get your manners? The... rude store?

06:02.141 --> 06:03.961
Oh my goodness!

06:03.543 --> 06:05.192
Aw, sweet burn dude!

06:06.593 --> 06:10.069
Nobody... insults my manners.

06:10.192 --> 06:12.668
Well nobody makes fun of my gear.

06:12.968 --> 06:16.843
And no one insults my new best friend.

06:20.605 --> 06:21.730
This sounds like a challenge.

06:21.730 --> 06:25.331
Woah, woah... you guys can't fight in my hallway.

06:28.355 --> 06:31.156
Rumble in the Rumpus Room!

06:33.059 --> 06:39.134
Ladies and gentlemen! I present to you a match-up of epic proportions.

06:39.242 --> 06:44.492
In the cool corner we got, Brian D.!

06:44.916 --> 06:48.491
And in the other corner we have some loser that was hardcore guffin' me.

06:48.541 --> 06:52.041
Alright, y'all know the rules! Single life, no respawns.

06:52.692 --> 06:54.641
Player one, are you ready?

06:54.641 --> 06:55.766
Let's do it!

06:55.766 --> 06:57.166
New best friend, are you ready?

06:57.442 --> 06:59.391
Brian, I just looked at the official rulebook.

06:59.391 --> 07:01.891
I really think that you should look at paragraphs 12 through 90.

07:02.166 --> 07:03.441
Any chance you could paraphrase?

07:03.416 --> 07:05.216
Oh okay, um.

07:05.242 --> 07:06.982
Read rules. Important.

07:06.982 --> 07:08.053
That's not what I meant, Ki!

07:10.959 --> 07:12.779
Alright, let's get it on!!

07:55.380 --> 07:58.880
You can't hide from me! You're like a minnow, and I'm a shark, I'm gonna eat 'cha.

08:03.074 --> 08:04.624
Great timing, Chiba.

08:24.920 --> 08:28.245
Yes! Yes! Ha ha!

08:29.346 --> 08:32.145
Who's working at the poor store now?

08:40.014 --> 08:41.364
Wait, what just happened?

08:41.364 --> 08:44.163
Oh, Brian. Paragraph 90, Section 3.

08:44.153 --> 08:48.110
Should a student's rank fall below zero, then they are automatically, ruthlessly and instantly--

08:48.159 --> 08:49.559
Expelled.

08:54.748 --> 08:56.848
Annihilist, dude, I didn't know...

09:02.464 --> 09:04.564
Four more reasons, Brian.

09:04.596 --> 09:06.416
Welcome to VGHS.

09:07.921 --> 09:10.021
Jenny, wait! Where's my room?!

09:12.071 --> 09:13.465
On the plus side, dude...

09:13.495 --> 09:15.237
That guy was supposed to be your roommate.

09:15.238 --> 09:18.738
Dude, I just got a kid expelled. How is that a plus side?

09:20.313 --> 09:23.113
YEAH!! Best roommate friends forever!!

09:26.114 --> 09:27.514
I'm okay.

10:01.471 --> 10:03.291
The one-shot wonder.

10:05.192 --> 10:06.788
We meet at last.

10:07.068 --> 10:10.866
Hey! Uh, the, uh... the Law...

10:12.336 --> 10:14.437
It's just Law around here, Brian.

10:16.255 --> 10:18.355
I don't mean to pry, Bri-guy, but, uh...

10:18.921 --> 10:21.721
Are you okay? What're doing here?

10:23.923 --> 10:25.743
Just gettin some air...

10:26.538 --> 10:29.338
You were gonna throw your gear out, weren't you.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.230
I dunno.

10:31.405 --> 10:33.328
VGHS is a little bit different than I thought.

10:33.328 --> 10:36.625
Chiba and Hanzo just kinda feel out of place.

10:36.947 --> 10:38.148
Brian...

10:38.148 --> 10:43.644
Look, who are we talkin about here. Your gear? Or you.

10:47.019 --> 10:50.315
I know, right? Stupid.

10:52.592 --> 10:53.713
Listen.

10:55.316 --> 10:58.362
Oh. Old school. Nice.

10:58.369 --> 11:01.115
Let me tell you something I've always kind of told myself.

11:00.840 --> 11:03.561
Fitting in at VGHS is hard, but...

11:03.660 --> 11:08.213
You can't be the best, unless you be yourself.

11:08.606 --> 11:09.726
Okay?

11:10.253 --> 11:12.353
Never... never forget that.

11:12.749 --> 11:14.849
Never let anyone break you.

11:15.794 --> 11:17.615
Do you really mean that?

11:18.164 --> 11:20.264
More than anything in the world.

11:22.561 --> 11:23.681
Chiba!!

11:23.956 --> 11:26.756
Too bad you're in my world now, Brian.

11:27.552 --> 11:29.224
Don't you get it, Brian!?

11:28.948 --> 11:31.169
I am VGHS!

11:34.195 --> 11:38.316
Welcome... to me!
