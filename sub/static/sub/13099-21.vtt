[instrumental music]

00:10.333 --> 00:13.750
(G'Kar)
'Does anyone here truly believe
the Centauri will stop'

00:13.833 --> 00:16.125
'now that they've seized
our territory?'

00:16.208 --> 00:18.083
'We are only the beginning!'

00:18.167 --> 00:20.375
You...all of you are next!

00:20.458 --> 00:23.917
Look, what happened was between
you and the Centauri.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.958
- It has nothing to do with us.
- Not now, but soon it will!

00:27.042 --> 00:29.542
Yes, for a moment,
their guns are silent

00:29.625 --> 00:32.583
but when they realize they've
been able to do this to us

00:32.667 --> 00:36.000
without interference,
their eye will turn to you!

00:36.083 --> 00:40.042
You sit in silence today
but tomorrow that will change!

00:40.125 --> 00:43.458
Are you willing to sacrifice
all that you are

00:43.542 --> 00:45.917
to keep all that you have?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.125
G'Kar, this is pointless.

00:48.208 --> 00:50.292
Why do you embarrass yourself
like this in public?

00:50.375 --> 00:53.125
They must know that our voice
can still be heard

00:53.208 --> 00:54.792
in the streets, in their sleep.

00:54.875 --> 00:58.083
We must keep reminding
the others that we exist!

00:58.167 --> 01:00.167
We are still here!

01:00.250 --> 01:03.667
If they forget about us,
then we are truly beyond rescue.

01:03.750 --> 01:07.208
G'Kar, please come.
There is a meeting.

01:07.292 --> 01:08.875
Alright.

01:09.875 --> 01:11.917
[indistinct chatter]

01:15.167 --> 01:18.208
[instrumental music]

01:47.542 --> 01:50.167
Lennier said you were
calling for me.

01:51.167 --> 01:52.667
Yes.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.750
Is there something wrong?

01:55.333 --> 01:58.125
You, perhaps.

01:58.208 --> 02:01.000
We have sent for an inquisitor.

02:03.583 --> 02:05.667
An inquisitor.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.208
Why?

02:08.292 --> 02:11.333
To be sure about you.

02:11.417 --> 02:14.333
You will submit
to his authority.

02:16.042 --> 02:18.708
How will I know who it is?

02:18.792 --> 02:20.708
You will know..

02:20.792 --> 02:23.000
...if you survive.

02:29.875 --> 02:34.042
(male narrator)
The Babylon project was our
last best hope for peace.

02:35.250 --> 02:38.083
A self-contained world
five miles long

02:38.167 --> 02:40.917
located in neutral territory.

02:43.833 --> 02:45.792
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

02:45.875 --> 02:49.750
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

02:49.833 --> 02:52.750
A shining beacon in space

02:52.833 --> 02:55.000
all alone in the night.

02:55.083 --> 02:58.458
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind.

02:58.542 --> 03:02.750
The year the Great War
came upon us all.

03:02.833 --> 03:06.917
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
The year is 2259.

03:09.083 --> 03:12.542
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:13.708 --> 03:16.750
[theme music]

03:46.375 --> 03:49.417
[music continues]

03:58.708 --> 04:01.833
I'm not entirely sure
I understand, Delenn.

04:01.917 --> 04:05.958
You can tell me that someone
is coming to see you

04:06.042 --> 04:07.583
and that you have
business together

04:07.667 --> 04:09.375
and that you want him
passed through customs

04:09.458 --> 04:10.917
without incident.

04:11.042 --> 04:15.167
But you can't tell me who it is
or why he's coming.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.333
I know it's asking
much of you, captain.

04:17.417 --> 04:21.167
Delenn. Asking is not a problem.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.042
Not for you.

04:23.125 --> 04:25.833
'Not after everything
that we've gone through lately.'

04:25.917 --> 04:28.792
I'm just, you know,
trying to understand.

04:35.917 --> 04:37.792
Ambassador Kosh has doubts.

04:37.875 --> 04:41.500
- About what?
- Doubt is the wrong word.

04:41.583 --> 04:44.417
- He wishes confirmation.
- It's the same thing.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.208
Excuse me.

04:47.917 --> 04:51.333
As I understand it
Ambassador Kosh and the Vorlons

04:51.417 --> 04:54.708
are crucial to the big war
that's coming.

04:54.792 --> 04:56.333
Now, if he's worried
about something

04:56.417 --> 04:58.625
I wanna hear about it.

05:03.958 --> 05:07.917
Ambassador Kosh
is unsure about me.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.833
You, why on Earth--

05:10.917 --> 05:13.417
By aligning myself
with you and with Kosh

05:13.500 --> 05:17.042
I have placed myself at
the center of the coming storm.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.917
Kosh must be certain that
my choice was correct

05:20.000 --> 05:21.708
and made for the right reasons.

05:21.792 --> 05:24.500
If you do the right thing
for the wrong reasons

05:24.583 --> 05:26.750
the work becomes
corrupted, impure

05:26.833 --> 05:28.958
'and ultimately
self-destructive.'

05:29.042 --> 05:32.042
Ambassador Kosh
wishes confirmation

05:32.125 --> 05:34.083
that the right people

05:34.167 --> 05:36.833
are in the right place
at the right time.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.750
And whoever's coming here
will help him decide

05:38.833 --> 05:41.833
if you're one of these
right people?

05:41.917 --> 05:44.208
How?

05:44.292 --> 05:47.292
Delenn, if there's anything
that I can do..

05:47.375 --> 05:49.083
No.

05:49.167 --> 05:51.917
What I must do, I must do alone.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.625
I have agreed to this
of my own free will.

05:55.708 --> 05:59.333
Please do not interfere.
No matter what happens.

06:00.083 --> 06:02.750
[instrumental music]

06:02.833 --> 06:04.833
Ah.

06:04.917 --> 06:07.417
What do you have
for me, Mr. Chase?

06:07.500 --> 06:09.750
What I have is what you want.

06:09.833 --> 06:11.500
Provided the money's right.

06:11.583 --> 06:15.000
I need weapons, light munitions
that can be smuggled in

06:15.083 --> 06:17.250
or dropped from
low-altitude shuttles.

06:17.333 --> 06:20.875
Rifles, mines, pulse guns,
PPGs, jamming equipment.

06:20.958 --> 06:24.250
- I thought the war was over.
- You were misinformed.

06:24.333 --> 06:27.208
Our tactics have changed,
but the fight continues.

06:27.292 --> 06:29.958
An underground resistance.

06:30.042 --> 06:32.375
Good luck, G'Kar.
You're gonna need it.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.833
My luck is my concern.

06:34.917 --> 06:36.417
I told you what I want.

06:36.500 --> 06:40.167
Can you provide it,
or shall I inquire elsewhere?

06:40.250 --> 06:41.625
I can handle it.

06:41.708 --> 06:44.167
But these things
don't come cheap.

06:48.792 --> 06:51.000
That's the best I can do.

06:53.042 --> 06:57.000
- Too high.
- Suit yourself.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.583
There's a lot of risk involved,
you know.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.333
I note that many
of these weapons

07:01.417 --> 07:03.083
are the very ones
we sold Earth

07:03.167 --> 07:05.833
during your war
with the Minbari.

07:05.917 --> 07:07.500
Our asking price was far less

07:07.583 --> 07:10.458
than what you're charging me
to buy them back.

07:10.542 --> 07:14.208
Things are getting
very tense out there.

07:14.292 --> 07:17.333
Right now,
it's a seller's market.

07:17.417 --> 07:21.875
But don't ever let it be said
that I'm unsympathetic.

07:21.958 --> 07:24.833
Knock 10% off the top.

07:24.917 --> 07:28.292
- Let me think about it.
- Suit yourself.

07:28.375 --> 07:31.583
But when I come back tomorrow
it'll be full price.

07:35.917 --> 07:38.500
I'll put 50% of the fee

07:38.583 --> 07:41.708
into your account as a deposit.

07:41.792 --> 07:44.208
The rest payable upon delivery.

07:45.292 --> 07:46.958
Done.

07:47.042 --> 07:49.583
Good doing business with you.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.583
'Mr. Chase.'

07:52.500 --> 07:54.208
The money to buy these weapons

07:54.292 --> 07:56.417
comes from the life savings
of those Narn

07:56.500 --> 08:00.042
who were able to escape
the Centauri occupation.

08:00.125 --> 08:03.875
It is a limited resource
purchased with blood.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.208
If it should be squandered..

08:07.292 --> 08:09.083
...stolen..

08:09.167 --> 08:13.583
...be assured that while your
body might one day be found..

08:13.667 --> 08:17.000
...it could never be identified
from what's left.

08:18.125 --> 08:20.417
[dramatic music]

08:22.042 --> 08:25.250
Jumpgate sequence activated.
We've got a ship coming in.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.583
'Signature and frequency.'

08:27.667 --> 08:30.250
'It's a Vorlon transport.'

08:30.333 --> 08:32.583
I didn't know
Ambassador Kosh had left.

08:32.667 --> 08:34.250
He didn't.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.375
[whirring]

08:41.667 --> 08:44.542
- Ivanova to Sheridan.
- 'Sheridan here.'

08:44.625 --> 08:47.542
Captain, have I got
something for you.

08:50.708 --> 08:53.750
[intense music]

08:57.333 --> 08:58.625
You're sure you don't
want me to wait.

08:58.708 --> 09:01.875
No, no, it's fine.
I'll take care of the paperwork.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.542
Thanks.

09:23.042 --> 09:25.125
[walking stick tapping]

09:59.000 --> 10:02.042
[intense music]

10:04.000 --> 10:06.917
I believe I am expected.

10:13.417 --> 10:15.458
[indistinct chatter]

10:18.333 --> 10:19.833
(Captain Sheridan)
'I don't suppose
you'd mind telling me'

10:19.917 --> 10:22.000
'what you were doing
on a Vorlon transport.'

10:22.083 --> 10:24.000
I would, actually.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.667
Aside from Babylon 5,
I didn't know the Vorlons

10:26.750 --> 10:28.417
had any contact with humans.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.708
No, I'm sure you didn't.

10:30.792 --> 10:32.708
Where is Delenn?

10:33.958 --> 10:36.833
I'll send for her
when we're finished.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.292
(Sebastian)
'Nothing changes.'

10:45.375 --> 10:46.708
'Corruption.'

10:46.792 --> 10:48.667
'Immorality.'

10:48.750 --> 10:51.167
'Chaos.'

10:51.250 --> 10:54.125
(Captain Sheridan)
When were you last on Earth?

10:54.208 --> 10:55.917
Long ago.

10:56.958 --> 10:58.917
Long ago.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.458
You've been to their
home planet then.

11:00.542 --> 11:02.125
- Who? Yes.
- The Vorlons.

11:02.208 --> 11:03.542
You've seen them.
What they really look like.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.000
- Yes.
- Damn it!

11:05.083 --> 11:07.042
- Stand still for a second.
- I don't have time.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.083
- I wanna know--
- The truth?

11:09.167 --> 11:10.667
You're not ready for the truth.

11:10.750 --> 11:13.667
The facts, if that's the only
way to get to my work?

11:13.750 --> 11:15.833
Yes, the Vorlons
have been to Earth.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.250
The Vorlons have
been everywhere.

11:17.333 --> 11:20.583
The Vorlons are.
My name is Sebastian.

11:20.667 --> 11:23.083
I resided at 14B Heresford Lane
in London

11:23.167 --> 11:25.250
in the year of our Lord 1888.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.250
I was found by the Vorlons.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.250
Taken, transported,
and brought into their service.

11:30.333 --> 11:31.917
They told me everything
about everything.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.833
And the scales
fell from my eyes.

11:33.917 --> 11:37.000
And they were open to a universe
of majesty and terror

11:37.083 --> 11:38.833
that you will never imagine.

11:38.917 --> 11:40.792
They call upon me
when I'm needed

11:40.875 --> 11:42.417
and preserve me when I'm not.

11:42.500 --> 11:46.583
And they have called upon me now
for this interrogation.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.750
You will allow me to finish
the work that's brought me here

11:49.833 --> 11:53.042
or you will let me leave...
because either way

11:53.125 --> 11:56.250
I have told you all
that I intend to.

11:59.292 --> 12:01.333
If you'll follow me.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.458
Listen, uh,
word's getting around

12:05.542 --> 12:07.750
that you've been buying weapons
for use back home.

12:07.833 --> 12:10.458
- Is this true?
- Mr. Garibaldi.

12:10.542 --> 12:12.708
I have been on this station
long enough to know

12:12.792 --> 12:14.375
that you don't ask
leading questions

12:14.458 --> 12:16.583
unless you already
know the answers.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.958
So why don't we just pretend
I've lied about it

12:19.042 --> 12:22.083
you've caught me in your web
of ineluctable logic

12:22.167 --> 12:24.125
and cut to the point?

12:24.208 --> 12:26.917
Look, I know the captain's given
his promise of support

12:27.000 --> 12:28.625
but I also know
he doesn't wanna compromise

12:28.708 --> 12:30.875
the security of Babylon 5
in the process.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.583
Now, you wanna outfit an army,
that's fine

12:32.667 --> 12:34.500
you knock yourself out,
but I don't want those weapons

12:34.583 --> 12:35.833
coming through this station.

12:35.917 --> 12:38.375
Otherwise this place
is gonna go straight to hell.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.792
We are already,
as you so quaintly put it

12:40.875 --> 12:43.083
going straight to hell.

12:43.167 --> 12:45.333
You cannot escape what's coming.

12:45.417 --> 12:47.417
Well, maybe not,
but there's nothing wrong

12:47.500 --> 12:50.875
with getting
a good head start, huh?

12:50.958 --> 12:52.625
I mean it, G'Kar.

12:52.708 --> 12:55.167
I appreciate what
you're going through

12:55.250 --> 12:58.000
but don't go up
against me on this.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.917
You'll lose.

13:03.167 --> 13:04.583
Thanks.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.708
By the way, uh..

13:08.000 --> 13:10.625
I think you might find
this of interest.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.125
What is it?

13:12.208 --> 13:14.250
Well, I've got an old buddy
that runs a transfer station

13:14.333 --> 13:15.875
in sector 90.

13:15.958 --> 13:18.792
It's all by itself,
right near a jumpgate.

13:18.875 --> 13:20.583
Half the stuff he handles
is illegal goods

13:20.667 --> 13:23.792
but he manages to pay off
all the right people.

13:23.875 --> 13:25.583
I figure with all
that traffic, uh

13:25.667 --> 13:27.833
who'll notice a few more crates?

13:27.917 --> 13:29.208
I've already spoken to him.

13:29.292 --> 13:31.125
He'll bring through
whatever you need.

13:31.208 --> 13:33.250
No charge.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.042
Why?

13:35.125 --> 13:37.375
Eh, because he owes me a favor.
Now we're even.

13:37.458 --> 13:40.375
I meant why are you doing this?

13:40.458 --> 13:42.375
Because you didn't lie to me.

13:42.458 --> 13:45.208
But you must've known that
ahead of time.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.167
Like you said, uh,
I never start a conversation

13:48.250 --> 13:50.083
unless I know where it's going.

13:50.167 --> 13:53.458
But I always leave a little room
for someone to disappoint me.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.667
Thanks for not doing it.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.958
[instrumental music]

14:07.000 --> 14:11.083
(Sheridan)
The, uh, one you've been
waiting for is here.

14:11.167 --> 14:13.250
It took us a while
to find what he wanted.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.042
A place where you two
wouldn't be disturbed.

14:16.125 --> 14:19.083
He's waiting for you now
in Grey 19.

14:19.167 --> 14:20.250
(Delenn)
Thank you, captain.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.875
Delenn.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.125
Are you sure you wanna go
through with this?

14:25.208 --> 14:28.125
I've just spent
some time with him, and..

14:28.208 --> 14:30.750
...I don't like what I see.

14:30.833 --> 14:33.750
(Delenn)
I'm sure it will be fine,
captain.

14:33.833 --> 14:36.167
Thank you for your help.

14:37.250 --> 14:40.333
[instrumental music]

14:44.833 --> 14:46.667
[clangs]

15:08.583 --> 15:10.833
(Sebastian)
'That's far enough.'

15:14.750 --> 15:18.250
[scraping]

15:18.333 --> 15:20.292
'Put them on.'

15:23.083 --> 15:25.500
'The manacles are made for you.'

15:25.583 --> 15:27.458
'You can remove them
at any time.'

15:27.542 --> 15:31.375
'But if you do so,
you admit failure and defeat'

15:31.458 --> 15:33.083
'and will stand
before the Vorlon'

15:33.167 --> 15:36.000
'as inadequate
for the task ahead.'

15:37.083 --> 15:39.083
'Do you understand?'

15:40.417 --> 15:42.042
Yes.

15:42.125 --> 15:44.208
[walking stick tapping]

15:53.417 --> 15:55.250
Who are you?

15:56.750 --> 15:59.833
- I'm Delenn.
- Unacceptable answer.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.667
I already know your name.

16:03.625 --> 16:06.208
Who are you?

16:06.292 --> 16:07.917
'Delenn.'

16:08.000 --> 16:10.375
[groaning]

16:10.458 --> 16:12.750
'If you repeat
an unacceptable answer'

16:12.833 --> 16:15.625
the penalty will be increased.

16:17.792 --> 16:19.667
Who are you?

16:20.667 --> 16:22.917
I, uh..

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I'm the ambassador for Minbar.

16:25.083 --> 16:26.542
Unacceptable!

16:26.625 --> 16:28.167
That is only your title.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.417
What other people call you

16:29.500 --> 16:32.417
when you choose to hide
behind formalities.

16:33.542 --> 16:35.458
Who are you?

16:35.542 --> 16:37.292
I, uh..

16:37.375 --> 16:38.417
I..

16:38.500 --> 16:39.833
I'm the daughter of--

16:39.917 --> 16:42.875
- Unacceptable!
- Ohh!

16:47.792 --> 16:50.250
What a sad thing you are.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.208
Unable to answer even
such a simple question

16:53.292 --> 16:55.833
without falling back
on references

16:55.917 --> 16:59.667
and genealogies
and what other people call you.

17:00.875 --> 17:03.625
Have you nothing of your own?

17:03.708 --> 17:07.750
Nothing to...stand on
that is not provided?

17:07.833 --> 17:09.917
Defined? Delineated?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.625
'Stamped? Sanctioned?'

17:11.708 --> 17:14.667
'Numbered and approved
by others?'

17:17.833 --> 17:21.083
'How can you be expected
to fight for someone else'

17:21.167 --> 17:23.750
when you haven't
the fairest idea

17:23.833 --> 17:26.042
who you are?

17:29.250 --> 17:32.625
Do you know how many
have stood before me

17:32.708 --> 17:35.417
as you stand now?

17:35.500 --> 17:36.792
Proud.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.583
Defiant.

17:38.667 --> 17:41.917
Full of their own
bloated self-importance.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.708
Confident that they are chosen.

17:44.792 --> 17:46.500
Special.

17:46.583 --> 17:48.917
Favored of God?

17:51.208 --> 17:54.208
All of them have broken.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.125
And better for everyone
that they did.

17:58.208 --> 18:00.625
Better to spare others

18:00.708 --> 18:04.625
the illusion
of false hope.

18:07.042 --> 18:10.208
You have the audacity to presume

18:10.292 --> 18:12.458
that you are
on a mission from God.

18:12.542 --> 18:16.042
Embarked upon a holy cause!

18:16.125 --> 18:19.500
I...don't...believe it.

18:21.750 --> 18:24.375
And by the time you leave here..

18:25.208 --> 18:27.458
...neither will you.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.708
It is even possible..

18:31.792 --> 18:33.917
'...that you may die here.'

18:35.917 --> 18:39.125
What purpose will be served
by killing me?

18:40.000 --> 18:43.458
Oh. I would not kill you.

18:43.542 --> 18:45.833
You can remove the manacles
at any time.

18:45.917 --> 18:49.875
But that would mean
admitting your error

18:49.958 --> 18:51.833
admitting that you are not
worthy enough

18:51.917 --> 18:54.458
or strong enough
for the task ahead.

18:54.542 --> 18:58.542
And pride will prevent you
from doing that.

18:58.625 --> 19:00.792
If you believe
you are the chosen

19:00.875 --> 19:03.292
then you must risk everything
on the premise

19:03.375 --> 19:07.000
that the universe
will not let you die.

19:11.583 --> 19:14.458
Unless...you're wrong.

19:16.708 --> 19:18.875
'And here..'

19:18.958 --> 19:20.458
'...now..'

19:20.542 --> 19:22.708
...together..

19:22.792 --> 19:25.042
...we will find out.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.250
Once..

19:28.208 --> 19:30.208
...and for all.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.417
Ah. Mr. Cotto. There you are.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.792
I have a message for
Ambassador Mollari, a favor.

19:38.875 --> 19:40.542
I've already told you
the ambassador

19:40.625 --> 19:42.250
can do nothing for you.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.500
I don't think you understand.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.250
There really is nothing
more to say.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.708
- Good day.
- Please reconsider.

19:48.458 --> 19:49.917
Green 5.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.083
[instrumental music]

20:43.042 --> 20:44.917
I'm sorry.

20:46.958 --> 20:48.583
'I wish, um'

20:48.667 --> 20:51.500
...there was something
that I could do, but..

20:54.542 --> 20:56.250
I tried telling them, but..

20:56.333 --> 20:58.083
they, they wouldn't listen.

20:58.167 --> 21:00.625
Th-they never listen. I..

21:06.917 --> 21:08.625
I'm sorry.

21:20.583 --> 21:23.667
Dead. Dead. Dead.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.875
Dead. Dead. Dead.

21:26.958 --> 21:30.625
Dead. Dead. Dead.

21:30.708 --> 21:33.542
Dead. Dead.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.333
How do you apologize to them?

21:36.417 --> 21:38.500
I can't.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.750
Then I cannot forgive.

21:42.833 --> 21:44.875
[intense music]

21:56.708 --> 21:58.542
(Sebastian)
You don't like it here, do you?

21:58.625 --> 22:01.000
You'd rather you were back
in your quarters asleep

22:01.083 --> 22:03.583
dreaming dreams of glory.

22:04.625 --> 22:06.708
I will go where I must.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.167
And why not?

22:08.250 --> 22:10.542
You are Delenn, the chosen.

22:10.625 --> 22:13.375
You tolerate all this
only by your whim.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.958
At a word from you
all the hosts of heaven

22:16.042 --> 22:17.917
would descend and carry you up

22:18.000 --> 22:21.125
away from harm,
away from this place.

22:21.208 --> 22:23.792
Because you have a destiny.

22:23.875 --> 22:26.417
We all have a destiny.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.583
Do we?

22:28.667 --> 22:30.083
How magnanimous of you.

22:30.167 --> 22:31.417
Sometimes we do not see it

22:31.500 --> 22:32.917
because we have been taught
to believe

22:33.000 --> 22:34.583
that we are not important.

22:34.667 --> 22:37.167
Taught by people like me?

22:38.708 --> 22:40.250
Perhaps.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.125
But are we destroyers of dreams

22:42.208 --> 22:44.625
or protectors
of the public good?

22:45.958 --> 22:47.875
Call out, Delenn!

22:47.958 --> 22:49.417
Call out to the universe!

22:49.500 --> 22:53.083
If it hears you,
surely it will respond.

22:53.167 --> 22:54.833
Call out!

22:54.917 --> 22:56.625
[screaming]

22:56.708 --> 22:59.708
Ah, yes, now. There we are.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.083
Let us see if
the universe responds.

23:07.292 --> 23:09.333
[whimpering]

23:14.208 --> 23:16.250
[breathes deeply]

23:19.000 --> 23:21.083
Silence.

23:24.292 --> 23:26.958
A silence as profound

23:27.042 --> 23:30.292
as when the whale
swallowed Jonah.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.500
Do you know why you're here?

23:39.583 --> 23:41.375
- Here?
- Here, now, yes.

23:41.458 --> 23:43.000
- I was sent.
- Here?

23:43.083 --> 23:44.333
Yes, by Kosh.

23:44.417 --> 23:46.000
No. You've answered
the wrong question.

23:46.083 --> 23:49.000
Why are you here now?
In this place, in this life?

23:49.083 --> 23:51.542
- I was meant to be here. Yes.
- Meant? By whom?

23:51.625 --> 23:53.250
- I don't know.
- Then how can you be sure?

23:53.333 --> 23:54.667
- I don't know.
- No, you don't!

23:54.750 --> 23:56.583
- Does it matter?
- What do you mean?

23:56.667 --> 23:58.208
If I believe
I'm here for a reason--

23:58.292 --> 24:00.333
And if the world says otherwise?

24:00.417 --> 24:03.375
- Then the world is wrong.
- And Delenn is right?

24:03.458 --> 24:06.458
Or perhaps, the world is right
and Delenn is wrong!

24:06.542 --> 24:09.250
Have you ever considered that?
Have you?

24:11.417 --> 24:12.792
Yes.

24:13.542 --> 24:15.042
Sometimes.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.042
Then there may yet
be hope for you.

24:21.125 --> 24:24.167
[instrumental music]

24:27.667 --> 24:29.542
As a reward..

24:31.125 --> 24:33.625
...I allow you ten minutes rest.

24:38.458 --> 24:40.292
And we are in the process
of developing

24:40.375 --> 24:43.333
an underground communications
net to homeworld

24:43.417 --> 24:46.708
so we can coordinate
the drops, time, location.

24:46.792 --> 24:48.208
What about the weapons?

24:48.292 --> 24:50.667
(G'Kar)
'The weapons have proven
to be more expensive'

24:50.750 --> 24:52.333
'than we had anticipated.'

24:52.417 --> 24:56.208
'Five hundred thousand credits
for the initial shipment.'

24:56.958 --> 24:58.375
I know it's a lot.

24:58.458 --> 25:01.583
But until we can find
alternate resources

25:01.667 --> 25:03.500
we must all sacrifice.

25:03.583 --> 25:06.750
How do we know the weapons
will reach Narn?

25:06.833 --> 25:08.417
I have given my word.

25:08.500 --> 25:11.958
It's not your word
we question, G'Kar.

25:12.042 --> 25:16.125
It's your ability to deliver
on your promises.

25:16.208 --> 25:20.000
Perhaps, someone else
might do a better job.

25:20.083 --> 25:23.500
If my word is not sufficient..

25:23.583 --> 25:24.500
...what is?

25:24.583 --> 25:26.750
Ever since homeworld fell

25:26.833 --> 25:30.083
we've not been able
to reach anyone back home.

25:30.167 --> 25:33.500
We don't know if our
families are dead...or alive.

25:33.583 --> 25:36.375
All communication
has been cut off

25:36.458 --> 25:38.750
except for official
Centauri channels.

25:38.833 --> 25:41.583
But if you can't
get a message through

25:41.667 --> 25:45.208
why should we believe
you can get weapons through?

25:52.167 --> 25:55.875
If we are ever
to win back our world

25:55.958 --> 25:58.083
we must be united!

25:58.167 --> 26:01.458
We cannot afford
the luxury of conflict.

26:03.375 --> 26:06.750
If I can get word
from your family

26:06.833 --> 26:10.125
will you and the others
accept my leadership?

26:13.042 --> 26:14.625
Yes.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.583
And if you can't..

26:16.667 --> 26:19.458
...will you step aside
for another?

26:25.750 --> 26:29.583
You will have the message
within 24 standard hours.

26:33.125 --> 26:36.083
Do you know what
your problem is, Delenn?

26:36.167 --> 26:37.500
You are a piece of the machine

26:37.583 --> 26:40.083
that thinks it is the whole
of the machine.

26:40.167 --> 26:44.083
The flute that believes
itself the symphony.

26:44.167 --> 26:46.250
You have malfunctioned.

26:47.417 --> 26:50.750
Admit it,
and you will feel better.

26:52.708 --> 26:56.208
Your only destiny
is to be the nail

26:56.292 --> 26:58.875
that gets hammered down.

26:58.958 --> 27:01.333
Bang. Bang.

27:01.417 --> 27:02.917
Bang.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.625
[grunting]

27:09.708 --> 27:11.958
You're being a fool.

27:13.542 --> 27:16.042
Then I'm a fool.

27:16.125 --> 27:19.750
But it's better to be what I am
than what you are.

27:21.917 --> 27:25.125
And what...am I?

27:25.208 --> 27:28.125
Please. Tell me.

27:29.667 --> 27:32.083
You are a creature

27:32.167 --> 27:34.250
who has received pain

27:34.333 --> 27:35.708
and given pain

27:35.792 --> 27:39.708
and taken too much joy
in its application.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.500
You have aspired to dreams

27:42.583 --> 27:44.583
and been disappointed

27:44.667 --> 27:46.875
because you were
not strong enough

27:46.958 --> 27:48.667
or worthy enough

27:48.750 --> 27:50.708
or right enough.

27:50.792 --> 27:52.625
So you lash out
at anyone who believes

27:52.708 --> 27:54.250
they can make a difference

27:54.333 --> 27:57.417
because it reminds you
of your own failure.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.042
You have to prove
they're just as bad

28:00.125 --> 28:02.667
just as flawed as you are!

28:03.917 --> 28:06.375
Am I close, Mr. Sebastian?

28:07.125 --> 28:08.458
Bang.

28:08.542 --> 28:10.583
[groaning]

28:10.667 --> 28:14.417
- 'Who are you?'
- I am Delenn!

28:14.500 --> 28:16.500
'And you have a destiny?'

28:16.583 --> 28:18.750
- Yes.
- No!

28:18.833 --> 28:21.500
Be a nice Minbari. Conform!

28:21.583 --> 28:24.208
Be quiet!
Admit you are inadequate!

28:24.292 --> 28:26.083
- No.
- Bang!

28:26.167 --> 28:27.750
[screams]

28:27.833 --> 28:32.833
I can feel your heart, Delenn.
I can hold it here in my hand.

28:32.917 --> 28:35.417
I can close my fist around it.

28:35.500 --> 28:38.000
Do you feel your heart, Delenn?

28:38.083 --> 28:40.917
Feel it slowing.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.042
Slowing?

28:43.125 --> 28:45.792
I can stop it.

28:45.875 --> 28:50.125
Another inch...and I will.

28:50.208 --> 28:52.250
[screaming]

28:56.083 --> 28:57.417
I know it is much to ask,
captain

28:57.500 --> 28:59.917
but time is short
and my resources few.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.833
A word from home,
once the simplest convenience.

29:02.917 --> 29:04.625
Now the only hope I have
of retaining

29:04.708 --> 29:06.917
control over my people.

29:08.833 --> 29:11.125
What you're asking is..

29:11.208 --> 29:13.375
...difficult at best.

29:13.458 --> 29:15.500
We haven't heard anything
directly from Narn

29:15.583 --> 29:17.708
since the Centauri took over.

29:17.792 --> 29:20.375
They say they'll open up regular
channels within a few weeks.

29:20.458 --> 29:23.500
Not soon enough.
I need this now.

29:23.583 --> 29:25.500
Here is all the information
on the family

29:25.583 --> 29:27.292
that needs to be contacted.

29:27.375 --> 29:29.917
If there is any way
you can help.

29:32.667 --> 29:34.833
I'll do what I can.

29:36.917 --> 29:39.542
- So what do you think?
- I think he's in trouble.

29:39.625 --> 29:42.167
No, I meant about using
the Rangers for this job.

29:42.250 --> 29:43.625
Send them into a war zone?

29:43.708 --> 29:45.375
Captain, I don't think
they're ready.

29:45.458 --> 29:46.708
Then it's time they got ready.

29:46.792 --> 29:51.167
We can't just keep planning
and watching forever.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.667
G'Kar is a known quantity.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.375
If he loses credibility,
we have no idea

29:56.458 --> 29:58.958
who the local Narns
might put up as a leader.

30:00.625 --> 30:03.750
I have a vested interest
in keeping him where he is.

30:07.125 --> 30:09.042
Tell the Rangers
to find these people

30:09.125 --> 30:11.042
get a message from them.

30:11.958 --> 30:13.833
I'll do my best.

30:13.917 --> 30:16.000
That's all I want.

30:19.458 --> 30:21.208
Delenn? Delenn.

30:21.292 --> 30:24.792
No, no, no.
No, you shouldn't be here.

30:24.875 --> 30:26.625
He'll be back soon.

30:26.708 --> 30:27.708
If he finds you, I--

30:27.792 --> 30:29.125
I've got to get you out of here.

30:29.208 --> 30:31.333
This is insane.
What does he want?

30:31.417 --> 30:33.042
I don't know.
I don't know.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.000
He asks the same question
over and over

30:35.083 --> 30:37.625
and I still don't know
why or what he wants.

30:37.708 --> 30:40.167
This doesn't make any sense,
how can I pass the test

30:40.250 --> 30:42.458
if I do not understand
the rules?

30:42.542 --> 30:44.208
[gasps]

30:44.292 --> 30:46.583
Please, you have to go, quickly.

30:46.667 --> 30:47.958
Not without you.

30:48.042 --> 30:50.542
If I leave, I will have failed
you and Kosh

30:50.625 --> 30:52.625
and I will have failed everyone.

30:52.708 --> 30:55.250
If you care for me,
you can't let that happen.

30:55.333 --> 30:56.750
Please, go.

30:56.833 --> 31:00.250
Please, go.
Go. Go. Quickly.

31:00.333 --> 31:03.375
[intense music]

31:05.500 --> 31:08.292
Captain! Captain Sheridan.

31:08.375 --> 31:10.083
Mr. Lennier,
what can I do for you?

31:10.167 --> 31:12.208
Defy Kosh.
You're the only one who can.

31:12.292 --> 31:14.167
You're the only one
he'll listen to.

31:14.250 --> 31:17.000
- Why, w-what's--
- It's Ambassador Delenn.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.083
The-the inquisitor..

31:20.375 --> 31:22.417
...I think he's killing her.

31:24.667 --> 31:26.667
[zapping]

31:35.458 --> 31:37.500
[screaming]

31:37.583 --> 31:40.625
[dramatic music]

31:50.292 --> 31:53.292
I'm afraid this isn't going
to work out for you, Delenn.

31:54.875 --> 31:56.917
'It's not really your fault.'

31:57.000 --> 32:00.167
'Your fate was dictated
long ago.'

32:00.250 --> 32:02.500
It's all in the hands of others.

32:04.125 --> 32:07.500
You were doomed from
the moment of your birth.

32:07.583 --> 32:09.625
[door opens]

32:11.833 --> 32:15.083
And the final player
in our little drama

32:15.167 --> 32:17.458
arrives at last.

32:17.542 --> 32:19.583
Leave her alone.

32:19.667 --> 32:23.083
- Why?
- Just do it!

32:23.167 --> 32:25.542
What is she to you?

32:27.250 --> 32:29.542
I don't have to answer
your questions.

32:29.625 --> 32:32.167
No, you don't.

32:34.292 --> 32:37.000
[grunting]

32:37.083 --> 32:39.125
[coughing]

32:42.750 --> 32:44.542
Your turn now.

32:44.625 --> 32:47.625
[dramatic music]

32:52.792 --> 32:55.750
'You said you didn't have to
answer any of my questions.'

32:59.292 --> 33:01.083
'But there's no reason
to exclude you'

33:01.167 --> 33:03.417
from our deliberations.

33:03.500 --> 33:06.000
You're linked at the hip.

33:06.083 --> 33:09.083
Just as bad as she is.

33:09.167 --> 33:11.333
But you're not just a dreamer.

33:11.417 --> 33:13.333
You're a soldier.

33:13.417 --> 33:16.000
How far are you prepared to go?

33:16.083 --> 33:18.042
How much are you
prepared to risk?

33:18.125 --> 33:21.417
How many people are you prepared
to sacrifice for victory?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.542
Are you willing
to die friendless

33:23.625 --> 33:26.083
alone, deserted by everyone?

33:26.167 --> 33:27.625
Because that's what
may be required of you

33:27.708 --> 33:29.083
in the war that is to come.

33:29.167 --> 33:33.250
- Go to hell.
- This is hell, captain.

33:33.333 --> 33:36.333
And you are its
chief damned soul.

33:38.125 --> 33:40.792
What about the people
you work with?

33:40.875 --> 33:43.333
The people you call friends?

33:43.417 --> 33:46.958
Are you willing
to sacrifice them?

33:47.042 --> 33:49.208
What about your family?

33:49.292 --> 33:51.000
What about your God, huh?

33:51.083 --> 33:54.375
What about truth?
What about blood?

33:54.458 --> 33:57.000
What about right?
What about wrong?

33:57.083 --> 33:59.583
What about your future?
What about faith?

33:59.667 --> 34:02.167
What about sin? What about hell?
What about death?

34:02.250 --> 34:04.292
- What about life?
- Enough!

34:04.375 --> 34:06.333
Your quarrel is with me.

34:06.417 --> 34:10.208
You were sent to investigate me!
Let him go!

34:10.292 --> 34:13.333
If you want to take someone
then take me.

34:16.375 --> 34:18.500
Well, well.

34:18.583 --> 34:22.500
A mutual admiration
and sacrificial society.

34:24.542 --> 34:28.083
- And what is he to you?
- None of your concern.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.458
Don't listen to him, Delenn.

34:29.542 --> 34:32.167
Just get the hell out
of here now! Go on!

34:32.250 --> 34:35.333
One single move,
a gesture..

34:35.417 --> 34:38.833
...and his life is snuffed out..

34:38.917 --> 34:40.792
...or yours.

34:41.875 --> 34:44.750
You would trade
your life for his?

34:44.833 --> 34:46.500
I thought you had a destiny.

34:46.583 --> 34:49.750
Is that destiny
not worth one life?

34:49.833 --> 34:51.667
If I fall..

34:51.750 --> 34:54.750
...another would take my place..

34:54.833 --> 34:56.917
...and another..

34:57.000 --> 34:58.125
...and another!

34:58.208 --> 35:01.917
- But your great cause?
- This is my cause!

35:02.000 --> 35:03.167
Life!

35:03.250 --> 35:06.542
One life or a billion,
it's all the same.

35:07.625 --> 35:10.875
Then you make
the sacrifice willingly?

35:10.958 --> 35:14.000
- Yes.
- No fame.

35:14.083 --> 35:16.667
No armies or banners or cities

35:16.750 --> 35:18.750
to celebrate your name?

35:18.833 --> 35:22.333
You will die alone
and unremarked..

35:23.458 --> 35:25.375
...and forgotten.

35:26.833 --> 35:29.333
This body is only a shell.

35:30.125 --> 35:32.792
You cannot touch me.

35:32.875 --> 35:35.208
You cannot harm me.

35:35.833 --> 35:37.792
I'm not afraid.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.875
[intense music]

35:50.042 --> 35:52.542
Delenn. Are you alright?

35:52.625 --> 35:54.917
Huh? Huh?

35:55.000 --> 35:58.625
I'm very good. Yeah.
What-what happened?

35:59.792 --> 36:03.167
- I-I'm not entirely sure.
- What?

36:03.250 --> 36:05.292
[door opens]

36:06.333 --> 36:08.042
Come on.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.750
You can go.

36:20.833 --> 36:22.875
You've passed.

36:22.958 --> 36:24.750
'Both of you.'

36:24.833 --> 36:26.583
Passed what?

36:26.667 --> 36:30.083
How do you know
the chosen ones?

36:30.167 --> 36:32.167
No greater love hath a man

36:32.250 --> 36:35.250
than he lay down his life
for his brother.

36:36.667 --> 36:39.250
Not for millions.

36:39.333 --> 36:42.208
Not for glory, not for fame.

36:42.292 --> 36:45.125
For one person.

36:45.208 --> 36:46.958
'In the dark..'

36:47.042 --> 36:49.292
'...where no one
will ever know..'

36:49.375 --> 36:51.375
...or see.

36:51.458 --> 36:54.583
I have been in the service
of the Vorlons for centuries

36:54.667 --> 36:56.625
looking for you.

36:56.708 --> 37:00.333
Diogenes with his lamp,
looking for an honest man

37:00.417 --> 37:03.292
willing to die for
all the wrong reasons.

37:05.208 --> 37:06.833
At last..

37:07.833 --> 37:10.292
...my job is finished.

37:11.083 --> 37:12.792
'Yours..'

37:12.875 --> 37:14.958
'...is just beginning.'

37:15.042 --> 37:18.667
When the darkness comes,
know this..

37:20.375 --> 37:22.958
...you are the right people..

37:23.042 --> 37:25.167
...in the right place..

37:25.958 --> 37:28.042
...at the right time.

37:32.125 --> 37:35.250
[instrumental music]

37:43.250 --> 37:45.292
[controls beeping]

37:52.875 --> 37:54.583
Captain, I just checked in
with Bay 25.

37:54.667 --> 37:57.000
The Vorlon ship can leave
in a couple of hours.

37:57.083 --> 37:58.458
Ivanova?

37:58.542 --> 38:00.958
How extensive
are our history files?

38:01.042 --> 38:02.625
- Earth or alien?
- 'Earth.'

38:02.708 --> 38:05.708
- Nineteenth century, England.
- Not a problem.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.167
What're you looking for?

38:11.250 --> 38:14.167
I wanna verify
a name and an address.

38:16.083 --> 38:17.625
14..

38:18.250 --> 38:19.917
14 B

38:20.000 --> 38:22.375
Heresford Lane, London.

38:22.458 --> 38:24.875
Around 1888.

38:24.958 --> 38:26.833
'Name?'

38:26.917 --> 38:30.042
- Sebastian.
- 'First or last?'

38:33.875 --> 38:35.792
I don't know.

38:37.292 --> 38:39.708
This may take a while.

38:39.792 --> 38:42.833
We've kept everyone together.

38:42.917 --> 38:45.500
Nala was hurt during the attack.

38:47.042 --> 38:49.583
'But she's fine now.'

38:49.667 --> 38:53.125
'We just found out today
that your father is alive.'

38:53.208 --> 38:55.792
'Thank G'Quan.'

38:55.875 --> 38:57.750
'We miss you.'

38:57.833 --> 39:00.333
'And hope you are well.'

39:00.417 --> 39:02.750
'Try not to worry.'

39:02.833 --> 39:04.958
'We will survive.'

39:07.875 --> 39:09.958
[indistinct whispering]

39:17.750 --> 39:20.000
You've kept your promise.

39:20.083 --> 39:23.917
My family...is alive.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.583
Thank you.

39:27.042 --> 39:29.583
We will not
question you, G'Kar.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.792
We are with you.

39:36.917 --> 39:40.042
[instrumental music]

39:47.875 --> 39:49.125
Your ship's ready to go.

39:49.208 --> 39:50.958
I've taken care
of all the clearances.

39:51.042 --> 39:53.000
Thank you.

39:53.083 --> 39:55.250
Mr. Sebastian?

39:57.708 --> 40:00.958
I did a little digging
based on what you told me.

40:02.583 --> 40:04.958
The records confirm..

40:05.042 --> 40:06.917
...you lived on Earth.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.667
In London, in the year 1888.

40:11.333 --> 40:14.917
But the records also indicate

40:15.000 --> 40:18.917
that you vanished suddenly
without a trace..

40:19.000 --> 40:22.125
...on November 11, 1888.

40:24.250 --> 40:26.875
That's a very interesting date..

40:26.958 --> 40:28.833
...Mr. Sebastian.

40:28.917 --> 40:31.333
The morning after the last
in a string of murders

40:31.417 --> 40:33.375
on the West End.

40:45.083 --> 40:48.167
The city was drowning in decay.

40:48.250 --> 40:51.167
Chaos. Immorality.

40:51.250 --> 40:53.333
A message needed to be sent

40:53.417 --> 40:56.500
etched in blood
for all the world to see

40:56.583 --> 40:58.250
a warning.

40:59.333 --> 41:03.208
In the pursuit of my holy cause

41:03.292 --> 41:05.208
I..

41:05.292 --> 41:07.417
...did things.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.375
Terrible things.

41:09.458 --> 41:11.583
Unspeakable things.

41:11.667 --> 41:14.292
The world condemned me,
but it didn't matter

41:14.375 --> 41:17.125
because I believed I was right
and the world was wrong!

41:17.208 --> 41:19.708
I believed I was
the divine messenger!

41:19.792 --> 41:22.333
- I believed I was--
- Chosen?

41:30.667 --> 41:32.250
I was..

41:33.125 --> 41:35.833
...found...by the Vorlons.

41:38.500 --> 41:41.958
They showed me the terrible
depth of my mistake.

41:43.208 --> 41:44.750
My crimes.

41:44.833 --> 41:46.250
My..

41:48.417 --> 41:50.375
...presumption.

41:54.500 --> 41:58.875
I have done 400 years of penance
in their service.

41:58.958 --> 42:02.333
A job for which they said
I was ideally suited.

42:05.292 --> 42:07.083
Now..

42:07.167 --> 42:08.750
...perhaps..

42:10.000 --> 42:12.750
...they will finally let me die.

42:13.708 --> 42:16.125
I think that might be wise.

42:24.208 --> 42:27.750
Good luck...to you
in your holy cause

42:27.833 --> 42:29.583
Captain Sheridan.

42:29.667 --> 42:33.750
May your choices have
better results than mine.

42:33.833 --> 42:37.417
Remembered not as a messenger.

42:37.500 --> 42:39.625
Remembered not as a reformer.

42:39.708 --> 42:44.042
Not as a prophet.
Not as a hero.

42:44.125 --> 42:45.625
Not even..

42:45.708 --> 42:47.833
...as Sebastian.

42:49.750 --> 42:52.208
Remembered only..

42:53.833 --> 42:56.167
...as Jack.

42:58.875 --> 43:01.917
[intense music]

43:06.625 --> 43:08.833
[theme music]
