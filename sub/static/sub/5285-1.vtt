# Oh, oh, oh #

01:37.097 --> 01:38.792
# Woke up today #

01:38.832 --> 01:40.265
# Feeling the way #

01:40.300 --> 01:42.461
# I always do #

01:42.502 --> 01:44.197
# Oh, oh, oh #

01:44.237 --> 01:47.536
# Hungry for something
that I can't eat #

01:47.574 --> 01:49.337
# Then I hear that beat #

01:49.375 --> 01:53.106
# That rhythm of town
starts calling me down #

01:53.146 --> 01:57.139
# It's like a message 
from high above #

01:57.183 --> 01:58.616
# Oh, oh, oh #

01:58.651 --> 02:02.985
# Pulling me out to the smiles
and the streets that I love #

02:03.022 --> 02:06.150
- Good morning, Baltimore!
- # Good morning, Baltimore #

02:06.192 --> 02:09.457
# Every day's like an open door #

02:09.496 --> 02:13.159
# Every night is a fantasy #

02:13.199 --> 02:17.135
# Every sound's like a symphony #

02:17.170 --> 02:20.833
# Good morning, Baltimore #

02:20.874 --> 02:24.037
# And someday when 
I take to the floor #

02:24.077 --> 02:27.706
# The world's gonna 
wake up and see #

02:27.747 --> 02:31.183
# Baltimore and me #

02:40.560 --> 02:41.891
# Oh, oh, oh #

02:41.928 --> 02:43.555
# Look at my hair #

02:43.596 --> 02:47.657
# What 'do can compare
with mine today? #

02:47.700 --> 02:49.099
# Oh, oh, oh #

02:49.135 --> 02:52.536
# I've got my hairspray and radio #

02:52.572 --> 02:54.335
# I'm ready to go #

02:54.374 --> 02:56.308
# The rats on the street #

02:56.342 --> 02:57.969
# All dance around my feet #

02:58.011 --> 03:02.141
# They seem to say:
"Tracy, it's up to you" #

03:02.182 --> 03:04.844
# So oh, oh, don't hold me back #

03:04.884 --> 03:07.785
# 'Cause today all
my dreams will come true #

03:07.820 --> 03:11.187
# Good morning, Baltimore #

03:11.224 --> 03:14.751
# There's the flasher
who lives next door #

03:14.794 --> 03:18.161
# There's the bum on 
his barroom stool #

03:18.198 --> 03:22.362
# They wish me luck
on my way to school #

03:22.402 --> 03:25.371
# Good morning, Baltimore #

03:25.405 --> 03:28.533
# And someday when 
I take to the floor #

03:28.575 --> 03:32.705
# The world's gonna 
wake up and see #

03:32.745 --> 03:35.339
# Baltimore and me #

03:38.051 --> 03:39.575
# I know every step #

03:39.619 --> 03:41.314
# I know every song #

03:41.354 --> 03:45.347
# I know there's a place where I belong #

03:45.391 --> 03:48.417
# I see all those party lights
shining ahead #

03:48.461 --> 03:52.591
# So someone invite me
before I drop dead #

03:52.632 --> 03:54.623
# Before she drops dead #

03:54.667 --> 03:57.636
# So oh, oh, give me a chance #

03:57.670 --> 04:01.663
# 'Cause when I start
to dance I'm a movie star #

04:01.708 --> 04:03.175
# Oh, oh, oh #

04:03.209 --> 04:06.440
# Something inside
of me makes me move #

04:06.479 --> 04:08.413
# When I hear that groove #

04:08.448 --> 04:10.211
# My ma tells me no #

04:10.250 --> 04:12.150
# But my feet tell me "go" #

04:12.185 --> 04:16.451
# It's like a drummer inside my heart #

04:21.827 --> 04:24.422
# So oh, oh, don't make me wait #

04:24.464 --> 04:32.564
# One more moment for my life to start #

04:32.605 --> 04:36.166
# I love you, Baltimore #

04:36.209 --> 04:39.701
# Every day's like an open door #

04:39.746 --> 04:43.147
# Every night is a fantasy #

04:43.182 --> 04:46.913
# Every sound's like a symphony #

04:46.953 --> 04:50.320
# And I promise, Baltimore #

04:50.356 --> 04:53.484
# That someday when I take to the floor #

04:53.526 --> 04:57.860
# The world's gonna wake up and see #

04:57.897 --> 05:01.424
# Gonna wake up and see #

05:01.467 --> 05:03.628
# Baltimore and me #

05:03.670 --> 05:05.137
# Yes, more or less, we all agree #

05:05.171 --> 05:07.105
# Baltimore and me #

05:07.140 --> 05:08.732
# Someday the world is gonna see #

05:08.775 --> 05:17.240
# Baltimore and me #

05:22.388 --> 05:26.085
Mount Everest is the most
famous, but not the highest...

05:26.125 --> 05:28.355
geographical point on this earth.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.885
Now, who can tell me what that is?

05:30.930 --> 05:33.125
Um, excuse me, Miss Whimsy?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.531
I can't see the board again.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.866
Tracy Turnblad.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.371
If I have to write you up...

05:39.405 --> 05:42.431
for inappropriate hair height
one more time...

05:42.475 --> 05:44.443
you will be removed to detention.

05:44.477 --> 05:46.877
Miss Wimsey, what am I supposed to do?

05:46.913 --> 05:50.041
Hair can't just hang there like a dead thing
on your cheeks.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.678
I mean, well... Uh-you know what I mean.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.154
I... Ahh.

05:56.189 --> 06:01.252
As I said, it is not Mount Everest.

06:01.294 --> 06:04.058
Now, next week we will be talking...

06:04.097 --> 06:07.032
about earthquakes and volcanoes.

06:07.066 --> 06:09.193
And as exciting as that might sound...

06:09.235 --> 06:13.331
we have to look back approximately
60 million years.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.840
Now, if you turn your pages...

06:14.874 --> 06:16.865
we are going to start
with the Ring of Fire.

06:16.909 --> 06:18.877
I want you to contemplate what causes...

06:18.911 --> 06:21.243
the separation of the two components.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.752
Penny, come on, hurry!

06:38.231 --> 06:39.528
Outta my way!

06:40.633 --> 06:41.861
Push! We're late.

06:51.944 --> 06:53.241
Ahh!

06:54.247 --> 06:56.738
- One minute to air.
- OK.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.419
40 to go!

07:04.457 --> 07:06.254
Don't change that channel.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.658
<i>Coming up next: The Corny Collins Show.</i>

07:08.694 --> 07:09.820
30 seconds.

07:18.204 --> 07:20.263
- Hiya, Dad!
- Goodbye!

07:20.306 --> 07:21.603
Hi.

07:21.641 --> 07:22.630
It's my daughter.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.644
10 seconds. Places, everyone.

07:26.813 --> 07:28.280
Hurry up, Penny, we're missing it!

07:28.314 --> 07:30.839
My mom says I'm not
allowed to perspire!

07:33.486 --> 07:36.114
Hey there, teenage Baltimore!

07:36.155 --> 07:38.282
Don't change that
channel 'cause it's time...

07:38.324 --> 07:40.792
<i>for The Corny Collins Show...</i>

07:40.827 --> 07:43.762
Brought to you by Ultra Clutch hairspray.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.493

07:56.943 --> 07:58.604

07:58.644 --> 07:59.838
# And then they shake it,

09:29.335 --> 09:30.632
Aah!

09:30.670 --> 09:31.637
# So, if every night you're shakin' #

09:31.671 --> 09:33.730
# As you lie in bed #

09:33.773 --> 09:34.740

# Mony, mony, ooh, mony, mony #

09:41.480 --> 09:44.278
# Who cares about sleep when

09:44.317 --> 09:47.150
# You'll never get to college

# Don't need a cap or a gown #

09:48.955 --> 09:51.981
# When you're the nicest kids in town #

09:52.024 --> 09:54.584
They must think my ears
are garbage cans.

09:54.627 --> 09:58.256
Would you turn that racket down?

09:58.297 --> 10:00.162
I'm tryin' to iron here.

10:00.199 --> 10:01.928
# Nicest kids in #

10:05.137 --> 10:07.230
# Kids in town, whoo! #

10:08.741 --> 10:11.608
<i>Ma, it's not racket.
It's The Corny Collins Show.</i>

10:11.644 --> 10:13.509
Well, it's turning your brains into mud.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.571
Mrs. Turnblad, it's a new dance!

10:15.615 --> 10:17.014
The Stricken Chicken.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.108
Well, I can't hear myself think.

10:19.151 --> 10:21.915
How am I supposed to negotiate pleats?

10:21.954 --> 10:22.921
Edna?

10:22.955 --> 10:24.650
I'm in here, Prudy.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.920
What's that racket?

10:26.959 --> 10:29.291
Ohh, Tracy.

10:29.328 --> 10:30.795
Edna, is my laundry ready?

10:30.830 --> 10:32.457
Yep.

10:32.498 --> 10:34.432
That'll be $3.00, hon.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.958
That's pretty pricey
for a pair of petty pants.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.027
Well, I'm sorry, Prudy...

10:38.070 --> 10:39.503
but some-a your personal stains...

10:39.538 --> 10:41.665
required poundin' with a rock.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.107
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

10:45.511 --> 10:48.810
You're letting her listen
to that race music again?

10:48.848 --> 10:51.646
My daughter spends every afternoon
at the Stamp and Coin Club.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.982
Oh, really? Well, your daughter hap-

10:54.020 --> 10:55.817
Ohh, ohh.

10:55.855 --> 10:58.449
Oh, what is that? The Wavin' Raven?

10:58.491 --> 11:00.356
It's a little twitchy.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.761
Oh, you wanna play Charades now.
All right.

11:04.797 --> 11:06.321
OK, go ahead.

11:06.365 --> 11:07.662
You.

11:07.700 --> 11:08.724
Penny.

11:09.769 --> 11:11.327
No. Ahh!

11:12.371 --> 11:15.067
Tracy Turnblad, are you tryin' to tell me...

11:15.107 --> 11:16.301
that-that Penny didn't get permission...

11:16.342 --> 11:17.673
from her mother to be here?

11:17.710 --> 11:18.836
What?

11:18.878 --> 11:20.072
Penny.

11:20.112 --> 11:23.013
You are banned from this house.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.983
You will never watch that show again!

11:25.017 --> 11:28.544
- Without that show I have nothing!
- Having nothing builds character!

11:29.555 --> 11:31.079
Toodle-oo, Edna!

11:38.764 --> 11:41.892
Give 'em a hand, folks.
All right, all right.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.970
And, once again,
that's the Stricken Chicken.

11:47.006 --> 11:50.134
We will be right back
for some more of that hot Detroit sound.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.676
And we're off!

11:53.713 --> 11:55.237
Corny.

11:56.782 --> 11:58.181
"Detroit sound"?

11:58.217 --> 12:00.481
What's that, the cries
of people being mugged?

12:00.519 --> 12:02.453
Aw, velma, the kids dig
the rhythm and blues.

12:02.488 --> 12:03.887
Yeah, they're kids, Corny.

12:03.923 --> 12:06.551
That's why we have to steer
them in the white direction.

12:06.592 --> 12:07.581
Right direction?

12:08.761 --> 12:10.251
Didn't I say that?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.935
I'll do it.

12:23.309 --> 12:26.244
You try that again and there'll be stumps
where your feet should be.

12:26.278 --> 12:27.802
You got that? You little whor-

12:27.847 --> 12:29.041
Amber.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.413
...holy moly. Baby.

12:31.450 --> 12:32.849
Good job dancing today.

12:32.885 --> 12:34.819
- It's time.
- Ah!

12:34.854 --> 12:35.821
Link.

12:35.855 --> 12:36.822
Amber.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.084
Ah!

12:38.124 --> 12:40.285
- Amber.
- Amber, Amber, Amber.

12:41.627 --> 12:43.720
Save your personal life
for the cameras, sweetie.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.628
Oh! Shiny.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.627
Tammy, Lou Ann,
you're gonna die.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.828
Speaking of cameras,
did you have a nice nap?

12:50.870 --> 12:53.771
If you'd do your job, my daughter wouldn't
have to fight to be visible.

12:53.806 --> 12:56.240
I gotta show some of the
other kids once in a while.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.709
You know, this is a small city.

12:58.744 --> 13:00.302
There aren't that many stations.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.177
This time next year
you could be wearing...

13:02.214 --> 13:04.842
an ill-fitting tux,
snapping bar mitzvah photos.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.312
I don't know.

13:08.087 --> 13:12.786
# It takes two, baby... #

13:14.326 --> 13:15.293
Show Link.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.659
This is nuts. She can't even dance.

13:17.696 --> 13:19.687
Plastic little spastic.

13:19.732 --> 13:23.634
Oh, Link. I can dance
so much better than her.

13:23.669 --> 13:25.796
Why don't you notice me at school?

13:25.838 --> 13:26.930
Mm-hmm.

13:29.074 --> 13:30.166
# Ooh #

13:32.311 --> 13:36.543
<i>Hey, that was our very own Link Larkin
singin' It Takes Two.</i>

13:36.582 --> 13:38.675
And I'm Motormouth Maybelle remindin'...

13:38.717 --> 13:41.743
the last Tuesday of this month's
your rhythm and blues day.

13:41.787 --> 13:44.483
That's right! Negro Day
will be comin' your way.

13:44.523 --> 13:48.823
So don't-uh... Uh... Over here.

13:48.861 --> 13:50.294
Thank you.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.890
So, catch all the croonin'
when y'all set and tune in.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.423
Thank you, Motormouth.
And now it's time to...

13:55.467 --> 13:57.162
Owner's coming. He'll call
my mother again, let's go.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.170
...very own fun-lovin'...

13:58.204 --> 13:59.501
Hey!

13:59.538 --> 14:00.527
Come on up here, Brenda.

14:00.573 --> 14:01.870
What?

14:01.907 --> 14:03.340
Brenda will be taking a leave of absence
from the show.

14:03.375 --> 14:04.842
How long you gonna be gone, Brenda?

14:04.877 --> 14:06.538
Just nine months.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.139
Seems like we'll have an opening
here on the show for a girl...

14:09.181 --> 14:12.582
just as fun-lovin' but maybe
not quite as freewheelin'.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.848
Wanna be one-a
the nicest kids in town?

14:14.887 --> 14:18.084
<i>Cut school tomorrow and come down
to station WYZT to audition.</i>

14:23.329 --> 14:25.058
- No.
- But, Ma.

14:25.097 --> 14:26.758
Don't test me, Tracy Turnblad.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.266
My diet pill's wearin' off.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.029
But come on.

14:30.069 --> 14:32.867
No one is auditioning for
anything in this household.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.930
But why not? Why not?!

14:34.974 --> 14:36.566
Because dancing is not your future.

14:36.609 --> 14:40.545
One day you're gonna own
Edna's Occidental Laundry.

14:40.579 --> 14:42.513
I don't wanna be a laundress.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.776
I wanna be famous!

14:43.816 --> 14:45.078
Look, if you wanna be famous...

14:45.117 --> 14:46.778
learn how to take blood
outta car upholstery.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.810
That's a skill you can take right to the bank.

14:48.854 --> 14:51.482
- Hey, hey. What's all this ruckus in here?
- Not a word.

14:51.523 --> 14:54.390
Daddy, tomorrow I'm auditioning
to dance on a Tv show.

14:54.426 --> 14:55.586
- No, she is not.
- You are?

14:55.628 --> 14:57.289
First the hair, now this?

14:57.329 --> 14:59.354
But all the kids are battin' up
their hair now, hon.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.422
You're no help.

15:00.466 --> 15:01.558
It's "ratting," Daddy.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.397
And our first lady,
Jacqueline Kennedy, does it.

15:03.435 --> 15:04.493
I don't believe that.

15:04.536 --> 15:05.560
What do you mean,
you don't believe that?!

15:05.604 --> 15:07.731
- I don't.
- How else would it look that way?

15:07.773 --> 15:09.638
I believe that it is naturally stiff.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.508
She doesn't understand anything.

15:12.544 --> 15:15.342
- Dancing on that show is my dream.
- I know.

15:15.381 --> 15:18.646
Just because she wouldn't know
a dream if it bit her on the nose.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.549
Well, I have information for you, missy.

15:20.586 --> 15:24.044
I once had a dream that I owned
a coin-operated laundromat...

15:24.089 --> 15:27.149
and I came down from that cloud
real quickly, I'll tell you that.

15:27.192 --> 15:28.454
No!

15:28.494 --> 15:31.088
- Oh, Wilbur.
- Fine! I'm going to my room!

15:31.130 --> 15:32.893
She thinks I'm bein' mean
but I'm not. Those Tv people...

15:32.932 --> 15:37.426
they don't pick people like Tracy,
or girls like us.

15:37.469 --> 15:39.460
They're gonna hurt her, Wilbur.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.099
I'll talk to her.

15:42.141 --> 15:43.574
Ooh.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.305
'K. Talk to her.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.908
I'll talk to her.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.313
Don't you worry.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.407
OK.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.145
What?

15:58.357 --> 16:00.985
Tracy, this Tv thing.

16:01.026 --> 16:02.789
You really want it?

16:02.828 --> 16:03.817
With all my heart.

16:03.862 --> 16:05.352
Then you go for it!

16:06.365 --> 16:07.855
This is America, babe.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.595
You gotta think big to be big.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.798
Big ain't the problem
in this family, Wilbur.

16:12.838 --> 16:15.466
You follow your dream.

16:15.507 --> 16:19.967
Mine came true, and now I have the most
precious thing in the world.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.507
The Taj Mahal of joke shops.

16:23.549 --> 16:27.485
Heh heh heh heh!

16:29.021 --> 16:30.613
Back step, cha-cha-cha.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.317
Side step, front step.

16:32.358 --> 16:34.326
Back and turn.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.123
Front step, cha-cha-cha.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.788
Tammy, sharper.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.695
Side step, front step.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.529
Back, again.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.626
Oh, my God, Penny, there's Link.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.159
Link!

16:45.204 --> 16:46.501
Penny, pinch me!

16:46.538 --> 16:48.506
Ow!

16:48.540 --> 16:49.837
You told me to.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.173
I can't believe I'm really here auditioning.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.701
Side step, front step.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.577
I can't believe I'm really
here watching you audition.

16:55.614 --> 16:57.479
Front step, cha-cha-cha.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.313
Back step, cha-cha-cha.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.285
Side step, front step.

17:01.320 --> 17:05.415
Back and t-oh, Amber.
Look at this motley crew.

17:05.457 --> 17:07.686
Oh! This town sure has gone downhill...

17:07.726 --> 17:09.125
since I was crowned
Miss Baltimore Crabs.

17:09.161 --> 17:10.185
Ugh.

17:10.229 --> 17:13.561
# Oh, my God,
how times have changed #

17:13.598 --> 17:17.262
# These girls must be blind
or completely deranged #

17:17.301 --> 17:19.031
# But time seemed to halt #

17:19.070 --> 17:22.199
# When I was Miss Baltimore Crabs #

17:22.241 --> 17:23.935
Amber, that move is far too dirty.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.240
Mother, wake up from
that dream of yours.

17:26.278 --> 17:28.246
- This isn't 1930.
- Ha ha ha.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.272
# You can laugh but life's a test #

17:31.316 --> 17:33.045
# Don't do this, don't do that #

17:33.085 --> 17:34.916
# Remember, Mother knows best #

17:34.953 --> 17:36.853
# For the crown's in the vault #

17:36.889 --> 17:40.586
# From when I won Miss Baltimore Crabs #

17:40.626 --> 17:41.923
# These steps are perfect ammunition #

17:41.960 --> 17:45.726
# Let me show you how your mommy
dear took out the competition #

17:45.764 --> 17:48.198
Girls, go get 'em.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.461
Boys, let's rumba.

17:49.501 --> 17:53.028
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.530
# Those poor runner-ups might
still hold some grudges #

17:56.575 --> 18:00.272
# They padded their cups
but I screwed the judges #

18:00.312 --> 18:02.906
# Those broads thought
they'd win if a plate #

18:02.948 --> 18:05.246
# They would spin in their dance #

18:05.284 --> 18:06.251
Aah!

18:06.285 --> 18:09.254
# Not a chance
Boys, put me down #

18:09.288 --> 18:11.222
Oh, good morning, ladies.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.621
Let's see what you got.

18:12.658 --> 18:16.594
# Twist, twist, twist, twist
mashed potato, mambo #

18:16.628 --> 18:17.822
# Ready, begin #

18:17.863 --> 18:19.728
# On my show you'll never find #

18:19.765 --> 18:21.426
# A thrusting hip or bump and grind #

18:21.467 --> 18:23.298
# What's that?
A dance for fleas and ticks? #

18:23.335 --> 18:25.200
# Oh, you should-a seen my bag of tricks #

18:25.237 --> 18:29.037
# Oh, I hit the stage batons ablaze #

18:29.074 --> 18:32.237
<i># While belting Aida
and preparing soufflés #</i>

18:32.277 --> 18:34.336
# But that triple somersault #

18:34.379 --> 18:39.646
# Is how I clinched
Miss Baltimore Crabs #

19:07.179 --> 19:08.305
Proceed.

19:08.347 --> 19:09.837
# Are you scared we're on live? #

19:09.882 --> 19:11.679
# No, I'm sure I can cope #

19:11.717 --> 19:14.311
# Well, this show isn't broadcast in #

19:14.353 --> 19:15.547
# Cinemascope #

19:15.587 --> 19:17.350
# I never drank one chocolate malt #

19:17.389 --> 19:22.326
# No desserts for Miss Baltimore Crabs #

19:22.361 --> 19:24.022
# This one will never get a date #

19:24.062 --> 19:26.053
# In those hand-me-down clothes #

19:26.098 --> 19:30.057
# Ha! Kid, she'll never get a date
till Daddy buys her a new nose #

19:30.102 --> 19:31.399
<i># I would say "Oy, gevalt" #</i>

19:31.436 --> 19:34.837
# If I wasn't Miss Baltimore Crabs #

19:36.875 --> 19:38.308
# Do you dance like you dress? #

19:38.343 --> 19:40.402
# Amber, there's no need to be cruel #

19:40.445 --> 19:43.744
# Would you swim
in an integrated pool? #

19:43.782 --> 19:44.840
I sure would.

19:44.883 --> 19:46.350
I'm all for integration.

19:46.385 --> 19:48.410
It's the new frontier!

19:48.453 --> 19:50.284
Not in Baltimore, it isn't.

19:50.322 --> 19:51.846
And may I be frank?

19:51.890 --> 19:54.051
# First impressions can be tough #

19:54.092 --> 19:55.650
# And when I saw you, I knew it #

19:55.694 --> 19:57.161
# If your size weren't enough #

19:57.196 --> 19:59.096
# Your last answer just blew it #

19:59.131 --> 20:02.931
# And so, my dear,
so short and stout #

20:02.968 --> 20:04.526
# You'll never be in #

20:04.570 --> 20:06.765
# So we're kicking you out #

20:06.805 --> 20:08.238
# With your form and your face #

20:08.273 --> 20:10.104
# Aw, well, it isn't your fault #

20:10.142 --> 20:11.507
# You're just down with a case #

20:11.543 --> 20:19.882
# Of Miss Baltimore Crabs #

20:19.918 --> 20:22.079
Uh, you may go.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.918
Um... Thank you?

20:28.927 --> 20:30.724
I think they secretly liked you.

20:43.508 --> 20:45.806
Cutting my class, Tracy Turnblad?

20:45.844 --> 20:48.904
I trust it was something really important.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.437
It should've been.

20:58.890 --> 21:02.348
# Gimme a break, yeah.
Right now! #

21:02.394 --> 21:04.954
# Got a brand-new sound,
so scream and shout #

21:04.997 --> 21:06.191
Hey! Hey!

21:06.231 --> 21:08.495
# With a funky rhythm #

21:10.168 --> 21:11.601
# It's a brand-new look that you can... #

21:11.637 --> 21:13.298
Whoo!

21:14.072 --> 21:17.269
# There's a party groovin'
let's get down #

21:17.309 --> 21:18.276
What you lookin' at?

21:18.310 --> 21:20.744
Nothing. Not you.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.081
Can I help you?

21:26.118 --> 21:27.551
That move's swish.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.213
Ya got that right.

21:29.254 --> 21:31.245
The man can dine me
on a diet of detention...

21:31.290 --> 21:33.758
so long as he don't starve
me of my tunes, baby.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.556
- Does that dance have a name?
- Oh, this?

21:36.595 --> 21:38.563
Call it the "Peyton Place After Midnight. "

21:38.597 --> 21:42.260
I use it to attract, uh, the opposite sex.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.428
Wow.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.131
That is so groovy.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.945
You're really good.

21:54.980 --> 21:55.969
Why, thank you.

21:56.014 --> 21:59.677
So would it be kinda like this?

22:00.852 --> 22:01.944
You can't do that dance.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.477
Hello, now.

22:03.522 --> 22:04.853
Not bad for a white chick.

22:06.658 --> 22:09.024
- Hey, I know where I've seen you before.
- Where?

22:09.061 --> 22:10.824
On Corny's show on Negro Day.

22:10.862 --> 22:11.988
Negro Day's the best.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.793
I wish every day were Negro Day.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.426
At our house, it is.

22:18.537 --> 22:21.199
Hey. Show me another one?

22:21.239 --> 22:23.264
You wanna see another one.

22:23.308 --> 22:26.038
Well-well, here's a little
something signified to say...

22:26.078 --> 22:28.740
Hello, my name is Seaweed...

22:28.780 --> 22:30.008
Oh, oh, oh!

22:30.048 --> 22:31.709
J...

22:31.750 --> 22:33.217
Stubbs.

22:33.251 --> 22:34.445
What's yours, baby?

22:35.954 --> 22:39.355
I'm Tra-cy Turn-blad!

22:40.392 --> 22:42.360
You're gonna get it, white girl!

22:42.394 --> 22:44.862
Well, Tracy, you got it goin' on, girl.

22:44.896 --> 22:46.158
You one of us.

22:46.198 --> 22:50.692
You're joinin' this program already
in progress!

22:50.736 --> 22:52.203
Well, let's go.

22:52.237 --> 22:54.205
# Whoo! #

22:54.239 --> 22:56.207
# Yeah! #

22:56.241 --> 22:58.573
# Got a brand-new sound,
so scream and shout #

22:59.911 --> 23:03.711
# Hey, a funky beat,
now let's be hurrying #

23:03.749 --> 23:05.216
Whoa!

23:05.250 --> 23:07.013
# We can't wait now #

23:07.052 --> 23:08.076
# Have some fun #

23:08.120 --> 23:11.419
# This party now has just begun #

23:11.456 --> 23:13.321
No, I get who Caesar is.

23:13.358 --> 23:15.258
But what's the "Ideas of March"?

23:15.293 --> 23:18.194
I mean, how can
a month have an idea?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.356
Hold on.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.763
Come on.

23:23.301 --> 23:26.566
# Come on and watch me strut my stuff #

23:27.939 --> 23:29.406
# Watch me #

23:29.441 --> 23:30.567
# Come on and watch me #

23:30.609 --> 23:31.974
How you likin' detention now?

23:32.010 --> 23:35.946
I'm a bad, bad girl who
needs to be punished.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.453
# Ohh #

23:42.487 --> 23:44.250
Hey.

23:44.289 --> 23:48.282
You know, Corny's hosting
the hop tomorrow.

23:49.628 --> 23:51.027
If he saw you dancin' like that...

23:51.062 --> 23:52.290
he'd put you on the show.

23:52.330 --> 23:53.820
Mmm...

23:53.865 --> 23:55.230
- See ya.
- Mm.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.064
Ah, whoa. Sorry, little darlin'.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.297
Hope I didn't dent your 'do.

24:02.574 --> 24:04.303
See y'all later.

24:04.342 --> 24:06.401
Hey, Trace. I was looking for you.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.810
What?

24:09.347 --> 24:11.440
# I can hear the bells #

24:11.483 --> 24:14.008
What? What are you talking about?

24:14.052 --> 24:17.488
# Well, don't-cha hear 'em chime? #

24:17.522 --> 24:19.251
Chime's not exactly how I'd put it.

24:19.291 --> 24:26.493
# Can't you feel my heartbeat
keeping perfect time? #

24:26.531 --> 24:31.867
# And all because he #

24:31.903 --> 24:33.165
# Touched me #

24:33.205 --> 24:35.264
# He looked at me and stared #

24:35.307 --> 24:37.434
# Yes, he bumped me #

24:37.476 --> 24:39.467
# My heart was unprepared #

24:39.511 --> 24:41.638
# When he tapped me #

24:41.680 --> 24:43.705
# And knocked me off my feet #

24:43.748 --> 24:47.980
# One little touch now my life's complete #

24:48.019 --> 24:50.214
- # 'Cause when he nudged me #
- Oh!

24:50.255 --> 24:52.382
# Love put me in a fix #

24:52.424 --> 24:54.324
# Yes, it hit me #

24:54.359 --> 24:56.384
# Just like a ton-a bricks #

24:56.428 --> 24:58.953
# Yes, my heart burst #

24:58.997 --> 25:01.056
# Now I know what life's about #

25:01.099 --> 25:05.001
# One little touch and
love's knocked me out #

25:05.036 --> 25:08.005
# And I can hear the bells #

25:08.039 --> 25:09.870
# My head is spinning #

25:09.908 --> 25:11.808
# I can hear the bells #

25:11.843 --> 25:14.505
# Something's beginning #

25:14.546 --> 25:18.073
# Everybody says that
a girl who looks like me #

25:18.116 --> 25:20.050
# Can't win his love #

25:20.085 --> 25:22.280
# Well, just wait and see #

25:22.320 --> 25:25.187
# 'Cause I can hear the bells #

25:25.223 --> 25:27.054
# Just hear them chiming #

25:27.092 --> 25:28.889
# I can hear the bells #

25:28.927 --> 25:31.487
# My temperature's climbing #

25:31.530 --> 25:33.259
# I can't contain my joy #

25:33.298 --> 25:35.459
# 'Cause I finally found the boy #

25:35.500 --> 25:37.730
# I've been missin' #

25:37.769 --> 25:44.675
# Listen, I can hear the bells #

25:44.709 --> 25:46.108
# Round one #

25:46.144 --> 25:48.612
# He'll ask me on a date and then #

25:48.647 --> 25:50.512
# Round two #

25:50.549 --> 25:52.881
# I'll primp but won't be late because #

25:52.918 --> 25:54.510
# Round three #

25:54.553 --> 25:56.714
# Is when we kiss inside his car #

25:56.755 --> 26:01.590
# Won't go all the way
but I'll go pretty fa-ar #

26:01.626 --> 26:03.218
# Round four #

26:03.261 --> 26:05.957
# He'll ask me for my hand and then #

26:05.997 --> 26:07.897
# Round five #

26:07.933 --> 26:10.265
# We'll book the wedding band so by #

26:10.302 --> 26:11.701
# Round six #

26:11.736 --> 26:14.432
# Amber, much to your surprise #

26:14.472 --> 26:18.499
# This heavyweight
champion takes the prize #

26:18.543 --> 26:20.807
# And I can hear the bells #

26:20.845 --> 26:22.574
# My ears are ringing #

26:22.614 --> 26:24.775
# I can hear the bells #

26:24.816 --> 26:27.216
# The bridesmaids are singing #

26:27.252 --> 26:31.120
# Everybody says that
a guy who's such a gem #

26:31.156 --> 26:32.919
# Won't look my way #

26:32.958 --> 26:35.392
# Well, the laugh's on them #

26:35.427 --> 26:37.725
# 'Cause I can hear the bells #

26:37.762 --> 26:39.957
# My father will smile #

26:39.998 --> 26:41.693
# I can hear the bells #

26:41.733 --> 26:44.133
# As he walks me down the aisle #

26:44.169 --> 26:45.932
# My mother starts to cry #

26:45.971 --> 26:50.533
# But I can't see 'cause Link
and I are French kissin' #

26:50.575 --> 26:55.569
# Listen, I can hear the bells #

26:57.749 --> 27:01.412
# Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh #

27:01.453 --> 27:03.512
# I can hear the bells #

27:03.555 --> 27:05.682
# My head is reeling #

27:05.724 --> 27:07.624
# I can hear the bells #

27:07.659 --> 27:09.991
# I can't stop the pealing #

27:10.028 --> 27:14.055
# Everybody warns
that he won't like what he'll see #

27:14.099 --> 27:18.559
# But I know that he'll
look inside of me #

27:18.603 --> 27:20.662
# Yeah, I can hear the bells #

27:20.705 --> 27:23.196
# Today's just the start 'cause #

27:23.241 --> 27:24.606
# I can hear the bells #

27:24.643 --> 27:27.441
# Until death do us part and #

27:27.479 --> 27:31.040
# Even when we die
we'll look down from up above #

27:31.082 --> 27:35.314
# Remembering the night
that we two fell in love #

27:35.353 --> 27:37.344
# We both will shed a tear #

27:37.389 --> 27:42.190
# And he'll whisper as we're reminiscin' #

27:42.227 --> 27:45.856
# Listen, I can hear the bells #

27:45.897 --> 27:47.865
# She can hear the bells #

27:47.899 --> 27:50.959
# I can hear the bells #

27:51.002 --> 27:53.835
# She can hear the bells #

27:53.872 --> 27:59.674
# I can hear the bells #

27:59.711 --> 28:05.377
# Bum, bum, bum #

28:13.925 --> 28:15.051
# Whoa! #

28:15.093 --> 28:18.392
# Hey, little girl with the cash to burn #

28:18.430 --> 28:21.422
# Well, I'm sellin' somethin'
you won't return #

28:22.767 --> 28:26.567
# Hey, little girl, take me off the shelf #

28:26.604 --> 28:31.098
# 'Cause it's hard havin'
fun playin' with yourself #

28:31.142 --> 28:33.133
# Once you bounce through
the whole selection #

28:33.178 --> 28:35.146
# Shake those hips in my direction #

28:35.180 --> 28:37.205
# Bringing back gifts
she never did see #

28:37.248 --> 28:39.079
# Take me home and then unwrap me #

28:39.117 --> 28:42.211
# Shop around but, little darlin',
I've got to be #

28:42.253 --> 28:45.086
# The ladies' choice #

28:45.123 --> 28:46.715
# Ladies' choice #

28:46.758 --> 28:48.589
# The ladies' choice #

28:50.695 --> 28:52.322
Go on. Get out there and show 'em.

28:52.363 --> 28:53.955
It's packed pretty tight.

28:53.998 --> 28:55.590
OK. I'll go in front of you and I'll push.

28:55.633 --> 28:57.726
# Test drive this American male #

28:57.769 --> 28:59.464
Wait.

28:59.504 --> 29:03.602
# It's gonna take cash to fill my tank #

29:03.641 --> 29:05.575
# So let's crack open your piggy bank #

29:05.610 --> 29:06.599
Hey, Seaweed!

29:06.644 --> 29:08.077
Wanna do Peyton Place for Corny?

29:08.113 --> 29:09.444
Are you crazy? You gotta
dance with your crowd...

29:09.481 --> 29:10.573
and I gotta dance with mine.

29:10.615 --> 29:11.673
Why?

29:11.716 --> 29:13.047
It's just the way it is, Tracy.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.381
But it's your dance.

29:14.419 --> 29:16.011
Well, how 'bout you go
borrow it for a second.

29:16.054 --> 29:18.215
- Really?
- Go get it, girl.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.953
# I'm the ladies' choice #

29:21.993 --> 29:26.127
# Ladies' choice #

29:27.832 --> 29:29.163
Whoo!

29:34.139 --> 29:36.164
All right! Yeah!

29:43.815 --> 29:44.975
Whoa!

29:45.016 --> 29:46.643
# Hey, little girl on a spendin' spree #

29:46.684 --> 29:48.675
# I don't come cheap
but the kisses come free #

29:48.720 --> 29:52.781
# On closer inspection
I'm sure that you'll agree #

29:52.824 --> 29:54.985
# Oh, hey, little girl, listen to my plea #

29:55.026 --> 29:57.290
# I come with a lifetime guarantee #

29:57.328 --> 30:00.422
# One day maybe we'll find
that baby makes three #

30:00.465 --> 30:01.454
Link!

30:01.499 --> 30:02.989
# It's the ladies' choice #

30:04.169 --> 30:06.865
# I'm the ladies' choice #

30:08.773 --> 30:10.570
# I'm the ladies' choice #

30:13.111 --> 30:15.204
# I'm the ladies' choice-choice-choice #

30:15.246 --> 30:17.407
# I'm the ladies' choice #

30:17.448 --> 30:20.178
Mr. And Mrs. Turnblad!

30:22.554 --> 30:23.714
Hey, look out!

30:23.755 --> 30:24.722
Ah!

30:25.623 --> 30:27.853
Mrs. Turnblad!

30:29.027 --> 30:30.995
Mr. Turnblad, come quick!

30:31.029 --> 30:32.360
- Me?
- Come on.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.631
Mrs. Turnblad! Come quick!

30:36.668 --> 30:38.033
You gotta see this!

30:38.069 --> 30:39.297
Oh, I read all about it.

30:39.337 --> 30:41.100
It's a big fake Hollywood set.

30:41.139 --> 30:42.504
No, Mrs. -

30:42.540 --> 30:44.371
You think I'm gonna think
that he's really up there?

30:44.409 --> 30:46.309
It's not John Glenn, Mrs. Turnblad!

30:46.344 --> 30:47.743
Well, why are we watchin' this?

30:47.779 --> 30:48.803
Just watch.

30:48.847 --> 30:49.836
- Lou Ann!
- Joey!

30:49.881 --> 30:50.848
Mikey! vicki! Becky!

30:50.882 --> 30:51.849
Bix! Jesse! Darla!

30:51.883 --> 30:53.612
- Paulie!
- Noreen!

30:53.651 --> 30:54.675
- Doreen!
- Link!

30:54.719 --> 30:55.913
And I'm Tracy!

30:55.954 --> 30:56.921
Aah!

30:56.955 --> 30:59.048
Oh! Oh, my!

31:00.225 --> 31:02.090
# Oh, yeah! #

31:02.126 --> 31:05.220
# And the bass and drums
are poundin' in your head #

31:05.263 --> 31:06.230
Go, Tracy!

31:06.264 --> 31:07.595
- Go, go, Tracy!
- Go, go, Tracy!

31:07.632 --> 31:10.362
# Who cares about sleep when
you can snooze in school? #

31:10.401 --> 31:13.097
# You'll never get to college
but you sure look cool #

31:13.137 --> 31:14.468
# Don't need a cap and a gown #

31:14.505 --> 31:17.099
# When you're the nicest kids in town #

31:17.141 --> 31:19.268
# Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo #

31:22.680 --> 31:25.114
# Kids in town, woo! #

31:25.149 --> 31:27.208
Yeah! That was the dance of the week...

31:27.252 --> 31:29.311
I don't know what happened, Mr. Spritzer.

31:29.354 --> 31:32.187
Corny had some sort
of aneurysm or something...

31:32.223 --> 31:34.191
and... picked her.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.921
...by our brand-new Council Member,
Miss Tracy Turnblad.

31:36.961 --> 31:40.226
So, Trace, come on, cozy up to old Corny
and tell us about yourself.

31:40.265 --> 31:42.563
<i>Well, I watch The Corny Collins Show...</i>

31:42.600 --> 31:44.568
and I do absolutely nothing else!

31:44.602 --> 31:46.229
Ooh! I sure like the way you talk.

31:46.271 --> 31:48.432
Oh, Wilbur, to think that
I almost stopped her...

31:48.473 --> 31:49.997
from reaching for the stars.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.874
And now here she
is on local daytime TV.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.640
She's gonna be a regular.

31:54.679 --> 31:58.911
Imagine, my little girl, regular at last.

31:58.950 --> 32:02.078
I also hope to be the first woman president
or a Rockette.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.883
And if you were president, Tracy...

32:03.922 --> 32:05.822
what would your first official act be?

32:05.857 --> 32:07.586
Hmm.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.820
I'd make every day Negro Day.

32:11.296 --> 32:13.992
I read you like tomorrow's
headlines, Tracy.

32:14.032 --> 32:15.090
What do you think, kids?

32:15.133 --> 32:16.600
You think we might
have a hot new candidate...

32:16.634 --> 32:17.828
for Miss Teenage Hairspray?

32:17.869 --> 32:19.996
That's only the dream of my life.

32:20.038 --> 32:21.733
But Miss Hairspray is mine.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.240
Uh, we're on the air.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.105
And your dream will be
comin' to you, sweetheart...

32:25.143 --> 32:28.510
<i>Saturday, June 2nd,
right here on WYZT.</i>

32:28.546 --> 32:31.242
You have to vote for a person, Corny,
not one of the Himalayas.

32:31.282 --> 32:32.271
Hi, Penny.

32:32.317 --> 32:33.648
Always the charmer, Amber.

32:35.353 --> 32:38.811
I want that chubby communist
girl off the show.

32:38.856 --> 32:41.347
Well, let me be the first
to toss the harpoon.

32:41.392 --> 32:42.620
She's a corrupting influence!

32:42.660 --> 32:46.289
I agree. We don't want our dancers
thrusting like savages!

32:46.331 --> 32:47.730
Hey, speak for yourself.

32:47.765 --> 32:48.959
Don't get flip with me.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.331
I'm not.

32:50.368 --> 32:52.131
Look, now I got some
new ideas for the show.

32:52.170 --> 32:53.535
First, we get rid-a Negro Day.

32:53.571 --> 32:55.801
Finally, some sense outta you.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.535
And we mix those kids in
with the rest-a the Council.

32:57.575 --> 32:59.042
Mix those kids?

32:59.077 --> 33:00.101
That's right, I said it.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.907
This is not a black-and-tan cocktail!

33:01.946 --> 33:03.345
Well, why couldn't it be?

33:03.381 --> 33:05.508
velma, isn't this where
it's all headin' anyway?

33:05.550 --> 33:08.314
Now, you can fight it
or you can rock out to it.

33:08.353 --> 33:10.617
Maybe it is time for some fresh ideas...

33:10.655 --> 33:13.681
like-like a nice, fresh new host!

33:14.759 --> 33:15.817
Heh.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.919
Gee, velma,
how do you fire Corny Collins...

33:17.962 --> 33:19.691
<i>from The Corny Collins Show?</i>

33:21.199 --> 33:23.759
<i>They do it all the time on Lassie!</i>

33:23.801 --> 33:25.826
velma, you've let this go too far!

33:25.870 --> 33:26.859
Me?

33:26.904 --> 33:27.996
- Fix it!
- What?

33:28.039 --> 33:29.165
Fix it!

33:30.775 --> 33:31.764
Ohh!

33:32.910 --> 33:34.741
# Hey, look out for that movin' van #

33:34.779 --> 33:36.406
# Drivin' down our streets #

33:36.447 --> 33:38.677
# You better lock up your man #

33:38.716 --> 33:41.742
# Before he meets the new girl in town #

33:41.786 --> 33:43.811
# Who just came on the scene... #

33:43.855 --> 33:45.618
Tracyface whoopee cushion.

33:45.656 --> 33:46.680
Good choice.

33:46.724 --> 33:48.954
We got your Tracy souvenirs for days.

33:48.993 --> 33:52.360
Here, your signed photos.

33:52.397 --> 33:53.557
Tracy wigs.

33:53.598 --> 33:55.156
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa #

33:55.199 --> 34:00.569
# We don't know what to do
'bout the new girl in town #

34:02.306 --> 34:04.035
# The new girl in town #

34:04.075 --> 34:05.940
# Seems to dance on air #

34:05.977 --> 34:07.342
# The new girl in town #

34:07.378 --> 34:09.777
# She's got the coolest hair #

34:09.813 --> 34:14.877
# You better tell the homecoming queen
to hold onto her crown #

34:14.918 --> 34:17.045
# Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa #

34:17.088 --> 34:19.818
# Or she's gonna lose it to #

34:19.857 --> 34:21.380
# The new girl in town #

34:21.426 --> 34:24.395
That big little girl is sending
my sales through the roof.

34:24.429 --> 34:27.556
More people are breathing
aerosol than oxygen!

34:27.598 --> 34:29.225
Do you think you could show us
some of those new dance moves?

34:29.266 --> 34:30.234
Yeah, sure.

34:30.268 --> 34:31.235
Ooh, pretty flowers.

34:31.268 --> 34:33.965
Tracy, wait up!

34:34.005 --> 34:35.438
# She's hip #

34:35.473 --> 34:37.907
# So cool #

34:37.942 --> 34:41.742
# I'm gonna get her after school #

34:41.779 --> 34:44.509
# And yet we'd like to be like her #

34:44.549 --> 34:48.746
# 'Cause she's the kitten
that the cats prefer #

34:48.786 --> 34:50.650
# The new girl in town #

34:50.688 --> 34:52.451
# Has my guy on a string #

34:52.489 --> 34:54.150
# The new girl in town #

34:54.192 --> 34:56.251
# Hey, look, she's wearin' his ring #

34:56.293 --> 34:59.752
# I can't stop cryin' and
so in my own tears #

34:59.797 --> 35:01.731
# I'm gonna drown #

35:01.766 --> 35:03.757
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa #

35:03.801 --> 35:06.497
# 'Cause he wants to rendezvous #

35:06.537 --> 35:07.731
# With the new girl #

35:07.772 --> 35:09.831
# We're kinda sad and blue #

35:09.874 --> 35:11.364
# Yes, it's true, girl #

35:11.409 --> 35:13.434
# We'd like to say #

35:13.478 --> 35:17.414
# To the new girl in town #

35:17.448 --> 35:20.713
# The new girl in town #

35:23.821 --> 35:25.584
Hi, I'm here to see Tracy Turnblad.

35:26.657 --> 35:28.056
Where's her write-up?

35:28.092 --> 35:30.652
She doesn't need a detention slip,
she's with me.

35:33.531 --> 35:34.520
Penny, this is Seaweed.

35:34.565 --> 35:35.532
Seaweed, this is Penny.

35:35.566 --> 35:38.262
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa #

35:42.440 --> 35:43.771
Huh.

35:46.711 --> 35:50.647
# To the new girl in town #

35:50.681 --> 35:53.912
# The new girl in town #

35:53.951 --> 35:55.851
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa #

35:55.887 --> 35:57.650
# From out of the blue, girl #

35:57.688 --> 35:59.622
# Hey, this town's in a stew, girl #

35:59.657 --> 36:01.557
# Ohh, what a hullabaloo, girl #

36:01.592 --> 36:03.389
# She ain't just passing through, girl #

36:03.427 --> 36:05.156
# Ohh, she's sticking like glue, girl #

36:05.196 --> 36:06.720
# Woo, to the man
I thought I knew, girl #

36:06.764 --> 36:08.493
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa #

36:08.533 --> 36:10.467
# Hey, look out for that movin' van #

36:10.501 --> 36:13.493
# Look out, look out,
look out, look out #

36:13.538 --> 36:18.976
# She was the new girl in #

36:19.010 --> 36:21.501
# Town #

36:26.717 --> 36:28.378
That's the way you do it.

36:28.419 --> 36:31.047
And I'm your fabled
Miss Motormouth Maybelle...

36:31.088 --> 36:34.319
<i>your DJ du jour,
pitchin' rhythm your way.</i>

36:34.358 --> 36:37.191
So, hey, better stay
and shimmy and sway.

36:37.228 --> 36:39.753
We'll be right back with more Negro Day.

36:39.797 --> 36:41.594
Brought to you by...

36:41.632 --> 36:44.897
Nap-a-Way, for stubborn hair.

36:46.304 --> 36:50.104
Every kink will be gone in a blink.

36:51.242 --> 36:52.334
We're off.

36:58.583 --> 36:59.675
Girls, that was great.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.845
How dare you pick the same song?

37:02.887 --> 37:04.377
They wrote it.

37:04.422 --> 37:05.684
You watch yourself.

37:05.723 --> 37:08.453
You are one inch from being canceled.

37:08.492 --> 37:10.551
You know what your demographic is?

37:10.595 --> 37:12.722
Cleaning ladies and lawn jockeys.

37:19.804 --> 37:22.068
A foot in the door, that's all it is.

37:22.106 --> 37:23.835
One toe at a time.

37:27.378 --> 37:28.572
Eh.

37:28.613 --> 37:29.705
Hello?

37:29.747 --> 37:32.443
Is this the Turnblad residence?

37:32.483 --> 37:33.450
Yes.

37:33.484 --> 37:35.611
Mr. Pinky speakin'.

37:35.653 --> 37:38.952
Mr. Pinky from-from the dress shop?

37:38.990 --> 37:40.218
Uh-huh.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.555
I'd like Tracy
for our spokesgirl.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.082
You want Tracy to do what?

37:43.127 --> 37:44.094
Be our spokesgirl.

37:44.128 --> 37:45.095
Be a spokesgirl?

37:45.129 --> 37:48.292
I think she'd be perfect.
I'd like to meet her...

37:48.332 --> 37:49.765
and discuss the details.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.097
As soon as possible.

37:51.135 --> 37:54.263
OK, um, well, we'll have send
someone down to meet you.

37:54.305 --> 37:55.272
Tonight, if you can.

37:55.306 --> 37:58.434
So, um, oh, OK.
Bye-bye, Mr. Pinky.

37:58.476 --> 37:59.443
Bye-bye.

37:59.477 --> 38:00.501
The Mr. Pinky?

38:00.544 --> 38:02.535
From Mr. Pinky's hefty hideaway!

38:02.580 --> 38:03.604
A spokesgirl?!

38:03.648 --> 38:06.981
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, tell me I get a free caftan, tell me!

38:07.018 --> 38:10.112
Oh, Tracy, I think perks like
caftans have to be negotiated.

38:10.154 --> 38:12.247
Maybe we should get you an agent.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.281
OK. You be my agent.

38:14.325 --> 38:16.293
What? Tracy Turnblad...

38:16.327 --> 38:19.125
has fame gone to your head
and made you wacky?

38:19.163 --> 38:20.289
Well, why not?

38:20.331 --> 38:21.298
Who's goin' to look out for me...

38:21.332 --> 38:22.321
better than my mom?

38:22.366 --> 38:24.300
Me, an agent?

38:24.335 --> 38:26.667
You see me hobnobbin'
and drinkin' rum and cokes...

38:26.704 --> 38:28.331
with all those hoi pollois?

38:28.372 --> 38:29.464
And out-negotiating them.

38:29.507 --> 38:30.804
Oh, you're crazy.

38:31.942 --> 38:35.275
Oh, Tracy, I haven't left
this house in-in years.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.541
Then isn't it time you did?

38:36.580 --> 38:38.138
Oh, no, Tracy.

38:38.182 --> 38:40.241
We'll have your father meet with him.

38:40.284 --> 38:42.809
L- I don't wanna be seen like this.

38:42.853 --> 38:43.820
Why not?

38:43.854 --> 38:46.118
I'll do it after my next diet.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.647
That's when I'll do it.

38:47.692 --> 38:50.160
Ya see, the neighbors haven't
seen me since I was a size 10.

38:50.194 --> 38:51.627
Don't make me do it, Tracy.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.995
Ma, it's changing out there.

38:55.032 --> 38:56.329
You'll like it.

38:56.367 --> 38:58.062
People who are different.

38:58.102 --> 39:00.366
Their time is coming.

39:02.373 --> 39:05.137
# Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, look around #

39:05.176 --> 39:08.236
# Everybody's groovin'
to a brand-new sound #

39:08.279 --> 39:11.214
# Hey, Mama, hey, Mama follow me #

39:11.248 --> 39:14.046
# I know somethin's in ya
that you wanna set free #

39:14.085 --> 39:17.020
# So let go, go, go of the past now #

39:17.054 --> 39:20.046
# Say hello to the love in your heart #

39:20.091 --> 39:22.924
# Yes, I know that
the world's spinning fast now #

39:22.960 --> 39:25.224
# You gotta get yourself
a brand-new start #

39:25.262 --> 39:28.060
# Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

39:28.099 --> 39:30.863
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

39:30.901 --> 39:33.927
# Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

39:33.971 --> 39:36.997
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

39:37.041 --> 39:39.942
# Go, Mama, go, go, go #

39:40.978 --> 39:42.809
# Welcome to the sixties #

39:42.847 --> 39:44.280
# Oh-o-o-o-o oh #

39:44.315 --> 39:48.877
# Hey, Mama, yeah, yeah, yeah #

39:48.919 --> 39:50.784
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

39:50.821 --> 39:53.289
# Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, have some fun #

39:53.324 --> 39:56.657
# I haven't left this house since 1951 #

39:56.694 --> 39:59.185
# Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, take a chance #

39:59.230 --> 40:02.427
# Oh, Tracy, it's been years
since someone asked me to dance #

40:02.466 --> 40:05.196
# So let go, go, go of the past now #

40:05.236 --> 40:08.399
# Say hello to the light in your eyes #

40:08.439 --> 40:11.135
# Yes, I know that the world's
spinning fast now #

40:11.175 --> 40:13.871
# But you gotta run
the race to win the prize #

40:13.911 --> 40:16.209
# Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

40:16.247 --> 40:19.273
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

40:19.316 --> 40:22.285
# Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

40:22.319 --> 40:25.311
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

40:25.356 --> 40:28.018
# Go, Mama, go, go, go #

40:29.293 --> 40:31.056
# Welcome to the sixties #

40:31.095 --> 40:32.562
Ma, you did it!

40:32.596 --> 40:34.427
Oh, Tracy, I'm a little lightheaded.

40:34.465 --> 40:37.059
There's so much air out here.

40:37.101 --> 40:39.228
Can't we go someplace that's stuffy?

40:39.270 --> 40:41.295
No, Ma, you're on your way.

40:43.607 --> 40:46.508
# Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

40:46.544 --> 40:49.775
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

40:49.814 --> 40:52.612
# Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

40:52.650 --> 40:55.710
# Oh-o-o-o-o-o #

40:55.753 --> 40:58.278
# Go, Mama, go, go, go #

40:58.322 --> 41:00.517
Oh. They're so glamorous.

41:00.558 --> 41:01.650
Wow.

41:03.761 --> 41:05.456
It kicked.

41:05.496 --> 41:06.622
Let's toast to that.

41:06.664 --> 41:07.756
To a boy!

41:07.798 --> 41:09.425
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

41:09.467 --> 41:11.833
# Welcome to the rhythm
of a brand-new day #

41:11.869 --> 41:13.700
# Take your old-fashioned fears #

41:13.737 --> 41:15.295
# And just throw them away #

41:15.339 --> 41:17.864
# You should add some color
and a fresh new 'do #

41:17.908 --> 41:19.569
# 'Cause it's time for a star #

41:19.610 --> 41:22.204
# Who looks just like you #

41:25.349 --> 41:26.680
Ohh.

41:27.251 --> 41:29.048
Ah!

41:29.086 --> 41:30.212
Oh!

41:33.691 --> 41:35.420
I thought we marked these down.

41:35.459 --> 41:36.483
What?

41:37.561 --> 41:38.653
Ohh.

41:42.132 --> 41:44.066
Thank you, Nadine.

41:47.872 --> 41:49.669
There's my shining star!

41:49.707 --> 41:51.299
Fantastic to meet you!

41:51.342 --> 41:52.832
I'm Mr. Pinky.

41:52.877 --> 41:54.139
It's so nice to meet you.

41:54.178 --> 41:58.740
Ha ha! Tracy, is this your older sister?

41:58.782 --> 42:00.682
Oh, my.

42:00.718 --> 42:03.687
Perhaps she'd like some
complimentary couture.

42:03.721 --> 42:04.745
Couture?

42:04.788 --> 42:07.518
Now, if you'll just sign here.

42:07.558 --> 42:11.358
Flattery will not distract
Miss Turnblad's agent...

42:11.395 --> 42:13.295
from reading the fine print.

42:13.330 --> 42:15.059
Her agent?

42:15.099 --> 42:17.192
Tracy, eat your donuts.

42:17.234 --> 42:18.496
Let's talk.

42:18.536 --> 42:19.525
Mm-hmm.

42:19.570 --> 42:21.162
All right, let's see here.

42:22.673 --> 42:23.662
All right. Now...

42:23.707 --> 42:24.674
Mmm.

42:24.708 --> 42:28.542
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No!

42:28.579 --> 42:30.945
I want a non-exclusive contract.

42:30.981 --> 42:33.506
Extensions by mutual option.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.917
And I want you to absorb
my 15 percent commission.

42:35.953 --> 42:37.352
Not a dime over 10!

42:38.389 --> 42:39.788
Throw in a bustier?

42:42.259 --> 42:43.226
Hmm.

42:43.260 --> 42:45.751
54 double D?

42:45.796 --> 42:47.388
Triple E.

42:47.431 --> 42:48.898
I hit the mother lode!

42:48.933 --> 42:50.560
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

42:50.601 --> 42:52.762
Care for a Baby Ruth?
I got one right here.

42:52.803 --> 42:55.237
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

42:55.272 --> 42:58.332
# Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

42:58.375 --> 43:01.503
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

43:01.545 --> 43:04.105
# Go, Mama, go, go, go #

43:05.950 --> 43:08.748
# Don't-cha let nobody
try to steal your fun #

43:08.786 --> 43:11.846
# 'Cause a little touch of
lipstick never hurt no one #

43:11.889 --> 43:14.722
# The future's got a million
roads for you to choose #

43:14.758 --> 43:18.125
# But you'll walk a little taller
in some high-heeled shoes #

43:18.162 --> 43:20.824
# And once you find the style
that makes you feel like you #

43:20.864 --> 43:22.388
# Something fresh,
something new #

43:22.433 --> 43:23.695
# Step on out, hear us shout #

43:23.734 --> 43:25.793
# Mama, that's your cue #

43:29.974 --> 43:31.464
# Ba da ba da-ba-da #

43:36.780 --> 43:37.974
# Step on out, hear us shout #

43:38.015 --> 43:40.108
# Mama, that's your cue #

43:40.150 --> 43:42.584
# Hey, Tracy, hey, baby, look at me #

43:42.620 --> 43:46.249
# I'm the cutest chickie
that you ever did see #

43:46.290 --> 43:48.884
# Hey, Tracy, hey, baby, look at us #

43:48.926 --> 43:51.793
# Where is there a team
that's half as fabulous #

43:51.829 --> 43:54.525
# I let go, go, go of the past now #

43:54.565 --> 43:57.625
# Said hello to this red carpet ride #

43:57.668 --> 44:00.796
# Yes, I know that the world's
spinning fast now #

44:00.838 --> 44:03.102
# Tell Lollobrigida to step aside #

44:03.140 --> 44:05.472
# Your Mama's welcoming the sixties #

44:05.509 --> 44:08.501
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

44:08.545 --> 44:11.639
# Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baby #

44:11.682 --> 44:14.617
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

44:14.652 --> 44:18.315
# Go, Mama, go, go, go #

44:18.355 --> 44:22.189
# Welcome to the sixties #

44:22.226 --> 44:24.820
# Open the door to the girl who has more #

44:24.862 --> 44:28.559
# She's a star, Tracy, go, go, go #

44:31.802 --> 44:33.326
# Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

44:33.370 --> 44:34.564
# Your mama's hip, your mama's in #

44:34.605 --> 44:36.368
# Hey, Mama #

44:36.407 --> 44:38.807
# Your mama's lookin' at herself
and wonderin' "Where you been?" #

44:38.842 --> 44:40.002
# Where you been? #

44:40.044 --> 44:42.069
# Your mama's lit, she's all aglow #

44:42.112 --> 44:43.773
# Your mama, what she's holdin' back #

44:43.814 --> 44:45.475
# Your mama's gotta let go, go, go #

44:45.516 --> 44:48.007
# Welcome to the "six", to the "O" #

44:48.052 --> 44:52.682
# To the apostrophe "s"
hey-yay, baby, yeah #

44:52.723 --> 44:53.883
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

44:57.861 --> 45:01.729
# Oh, yeah #

45:01.765 --> 45:03.926
# Go, Mama, go, go, go #

45:03.967 --> 45:06.868
# Oh-o-o-o-o-o,
oh-o-o-o-o-o #

45:06.904 --> 45:11.273
# Oh-o-o-o-o go,
go, Mama, go, go, go! #

45:13.310 --> 45:15.210
Mmm. Mmm.

45:15.245 --> 45:17.713
Wait till Dad sees you.

45:17.748 --> 45:19.215
Sees me?

45:19.249 --> 45:21.547
He never notices what I wear.

45:21.585 --> 45:25.214
In 20 years, he's never even said to me,
"nice muumuu" or nothin'.

45:25.255 --> 45:26.552
Now he will.

45:26.590 --> 45:30.048
Well, maybe, if he leaves
that shop for 5 minutes.

45:30.094 --> 45:32.585
I swear, I don't know
what goes on down there.

45:32.629 --> 45:33.926
Well.

45:33.964 --> 45:37.092
Mrs. Turnblad.

45:37.134 --> 45:39.659
I'd know whose mother
you were anywhere.

45:39.703 --> 45:41.432
Really?

45:41.472 --> 45:42.598
Hello, Amber.

45:42.639 --> 45:44.368
Hello, Tracy.

45:44.408 --> 45:47.844
Ma, this is Amber and Mrs. von Tussle.

45:47.878 --> 45:50.506
Mrs. von Tussle is the station's manager.

45:50.547 --> 45:52.742
Oh, the station manager.

45:52.783 --> 45:56.378
Oh! Oh, it was so nice-a
you let her on that show.

45:56.420 --> 46:00.447
Well, Tracy certainly has...
redefined our standards. Ha ha!

46:00.491 --> 46:01.685
That's for sure.

46:01.725 --> 46:03.488
Let me guess...

46:03.527 --> 46:05.518
brand-new dress?

46:05.562 --> 46:06.961
Oh, yes.

46:06.997 --> 46:08.692
Well, you'll stop traffic.

46:08.732 --> 46:10.063
Ha ha ha.

46:11.168 --> 46:13.033
It was nice meeting you. Tracy.

46:16.740 --> 46:17.934
Bye, Tracy.

46:19.176 --> 46:20.404
Ugh.

46:20.444 --> 46:23.607
Ma, don't listen to a word she says!

46:23.647 --> 46:25.046
I'm takin' this back.

46:25.082 --> 46:26.106
Don't you dare.

46:26.150 --> 46:28.243
- I am.
- Don't you dare.

46:28.285 --> 46:29.843
Don't you know why she hates us?

46:29.887 --> 46:32.617
She's afraid I'll beat Amber
for Miss Teenage Hairspray.

46:34.224 --> 46:35.213
Really?

46:35.259 --> 46:37.693
They can't put Tracy in special ed.

46:37.728 --> 46:38.786
I won't have it.

46:38.829 --> 46:41.161
I mean, even if I have to tutor her myself...

46:41.198 --> 46:42.893
they cannot hold my friend back.

46:42.933 --> 46:44.798
- You're a saint.
- Mm.

46:44.835 --> 46:48.271
Oh, and it's totally not true about her
and the entire football team.

46:48.305 --> 46:49.602
I mean, please.

46:49.640 --> 46:52.666
Anybody can get grass stains
all over their back.

46:53.610 --> 46:55.134
Amber, stop it.

46:55.179 --> 46:56.578
I'm sick-a you doin' that.

46:56.613 --> 46:58.342
Just because she's a good dancer.

46:58.382 --> 47:00.179
Uh! I'm sorry.

47:00.217 --> 47:02.082
You think that she can dance?

47:02.119 --> 47:04.280
Well, maybe you'd rather
have her as your partner.

47:04.321 --> 47:06.118
You could get sponsored by Goodyear.

47:06.156 --> 47:09.683
Excuse me. What is
going on back there?

47:12.095 --> 47:13.790
Tracy, that's horrible.

47:13.831 --> 47:16.664
Mr. Flak does not have breasts.

47:16.700 --> 47:19.863
What? No. I would-I would never.

47:19.903 --> 47:21.495
What... Oh.

47:34.318 --> 47:37.253
Oh, and Mr. Larkin,
perhaps you'd like to share...

47:37.287 --> 47:40.882
with the rest of the class Patrick Henry's
immortal last words.

47:42.159 --> 47:43.524
"Kiss my ass"?

47:53.403 --> 47:55.234
You didn't have to do that, Link.

47:55.272 --> 47:56.569
Hey, no prob.

47:56.607 --> 47:59.508
Besides, looks like
a cool scene down here.

47:59.543 --> 48:00.840
Right.

48:00.878 --> 48:02.869
Hey, cool.

48:04.014 --> 48:06.039
Hey, Tracy!

48:10.988 --> 48:12.012
Not quite, huh?

48:13.390 --> 48:15.255
Ah, damn. Just when I was gettin' it.

48:15.292 --> 48:17.760
Listen, man,
you ain't gotta stop now.

48:17.794 --> 48:19.819
My mom's havin' a platter party tonight.

48:19.863 --> 48:21.160
Y'all wanna come check it out?

48:21.198 --> 48:22.859
Now?!

48:22.900 --> 48:25.061
Would you mind if I, too, checked it out?

48:25.102 --> 48:27.070
I've never been to North Avenue before.

48:27.104 --> 48:28.696
Uh, well, would it be safe?

48:28.739 --> 48:30.331
You know, for us?

48:30.374 --> 48:32.535
Calm down, cracker boy.

48:32.576 --> 48:33.543
It's cool.

48:33.577 --> 48:34.703
Wow.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.770
Being invited places by colored people!

48:36.813 --> 48:38.474
It feels so hip!

48:38.515 --> 48:42.451
I'm glad y'all feel that way
'cause, uh, not many people do.

48:42.486 --> 48:44.750
- Y'all know what I'm sayin'?
- Yeah, that's right.

48:44.788 --> 48:47.154
# Hey! #

48:47.190 --> 48:49.886
# I can't see why people look at me #

48:49.927 --> 48:52.725
# And only see the color of my face #

48:52.763 --> 48:56.392
# Ah, yeah, then there's those that try
to help, God knows #

48:56.433 --> 48:59.732
# But always have to put me in my place #

48:59.770 --> 49:02.739
# But I won't ask you to be color-blind #

49:02.773 --> 49:06.140
# 'Cause if you pick the fruit then, girl,
you're sure to find #

49:06.176 --> 49:09.543
# The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice #

49:09.579 --> 49:12.605
# I could say it ain't so but, darlin',
what's the use? #

49:12.649 --> 49:15.777
# The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste #

49:15.819 --> 49:17.912
# And that's where it's at #

49:17.955 --> 49:20.321
# Now, baby, run and tell that #

49:20.357 --> 49:21.688
# Now run and tell that #

49:21.725 --> 49:24.591
# Run and tell that #

49:24.628 --> 49:25.925
# Hey, yeah! #

49:25.963 --> 49:28.261
# I can't see why people disagree #

49:28.298 --> 49:32.098
# Each time I tell 'em what
I know is true, oh, no #

49:32.135 --> 49:33.102
# And if you come #

49:33.136 --> 49:35.070
# And see the world I'm from #

49:35.105 --> 49:38.632
# I bet your heart is
gonna feel it, too, yeah #

49:38.675 --> 49:41.542
# I could lie but, baby, let's be bold #

49:41.578 --> 49:42.977
# vanilla can be nice #

49:43.013 --> 49:44.981
# But if the truth be told #

49:45.015 --> 49:47.609
# Blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice #

49:47.651 --> 49:50.882
# I could say it ain't so but, darlin',
what's the use? #

49:50.921 --> 49:54.152
# The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste #

49:54.191 --> 49:56.022
# And that's where it's at #

49:56.059 --> 49:58.357
# Oh, baby, baby, run and tell that #

49:58.395 --> 50:00.090
# Run and tell that #

50:00.130 --> 50:01.620
# Go run and tell that #

50:01.665 --> 50:02.962
# Run and tell that #

50:03.000 --> 50:04.968
# Come on and run and tell that #

50:05.002 --> 50:06.128
# Run and tell that #

50:06.169 --> 50:07.636
# Hey, run and tell #

50:07.671 --> 50:08.865
# Go tell #

50:08.905 --> 50:11.169
# Run and tell that #

50:13.844 --> 50:14.811
Link!

50:14.845 --> 50:16.403
Link Larkin!

50:18.415 --> 50:20.645
# Hey, yeah! #

50:20.684 --> 50:24.347
# Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah #

50:24.388 --> 50:25.480
- Whoo!
- Hey!

50:25.522 --> 50:26.614
Whoo!

50:28.058 --> 50:29.787
# Whoo! #

50:29.826 --> 50:31.384
Come here, girl.

50:31.428 --> 50:33.362
This is my sister, Little Inez.

50:33.397 --> 50:35.024
Oh, I know Tracy Turnblad.

50:35.065 --> 50:36.760
Good for you, girl.
You got on the show.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.529
- Well, you better be next.
- Ya got that right.

50:38.568 --> 50:40.661
Oh, you know she is.
You better show 'em, girl.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.331
Yeah!

50:42.372 --> 50:45.671
# I'm tired of coverin' up all my pride #

50:45.709 --> 50:48.405
# So give me five on the black hand side #

50:48.445 --> 50:52.108
# I got a new way of movin'
and I got my own voice #

50:52.149 --> 50:54.879
# So how can I help but
to shout and rejoice #

50:54.918 --> 50:58.581
# Oh, the people 'round here
can barely pay their rent #

50:58.622 --> 51:01.648
# They try to make a dollar
outta fifteen cent #

51:01.691 --> 51:04.785
# But we got a spirit
money just can't buy #

51:04.828 --> 51:09.322
# It's deep as a river
and soars to the sky, to the sky! #

51:09.366 --> 51:12.767
# Hey, I can't see the reason it can't be #

51:12.803 --> 51:14.896
# The kinda world where
we all get our chance #

51:14.938 --> 51:15.962
# Aw, yeah #

51:16.006 --> 51:17.303
# The time is now #

51:17.340 --> 51:19.900
# So we can show 'em how
just turn the music up #

51:19.943 --> 51:22.309
# And let's all dance, yeah, yeah #

51:22.345 --> 51:25.610
# 'Cause all things are equal
when it comes to love #

51:25.649 --> 51:28.743
# Well, that ain't quite true
'cause when push comes to shove #

51:28.785 --> 51:31.754
# The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice #

51:31.788 --> 51:35.451
# They say it ain't so but, darlin',
what's the use? #

51:35.492 --> 51:38.359
# The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste #

51:38.395 --> 51:39.862
# And that's where it's at #

51:39.896 --> 51:42.490
# Now, baby, baby, baby,
run and tell that #

51:42.532 --> 51:45.699
# Run and tell that #

51:45.735 --> 51:47.100
# Ah yeah, baby#
# Run and tell that #

51:47.137 --> 51:49.037
# Go run and tell that #

51:49.072 --> 51:55.341
# G-g-g-g-go home
and run and tell that #

51:55.378 --> 52:02.443
# Yeah, yeah #

52:02.486 --> 52:09.756
# Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah #

52:09.793 --> 52:11.590
# Whoo! #

52:11.628 --> 52:14.426
- Go, baby!
- Whoo!

52:16.366 --> 52:17.856
It was horrible.

52:17.901 --> 52:19.994
Mom, he just danced on that bus...

52:20.036 --> 52:21.560
with that great white whale
and those negroes.

52:21.605 --> 52:22.867
No, honey.

52:22.906 --> 52:25.807
Reeling him back in is
the easiest thing in the world.

52:25.842 --> 52:28.276
Remember, I control his career.

52:30.347 --> 52:31.314
Ohh.

52:31.348 --> 52:33.009
Now, don't worry.

52:33.049 --> 52:35.017
Mommy will take care of everything.

52:59.376 --> 53:02.641
Are you all hungry
for some good fun?

53:04.447 --> 53:05.436
# Yeah #

53:06.483 --> 53:09.941
# Bring on that pecan pie #

53:09.986 --> 53:14.821
# Pour some sugar on it,
sugar, don't be shy #

53:14.858 --> 53:19.818
# Scoop me up a mess
of that chocolate swirl #

53:19.863 --> 53:23.697
# Don't be stingy,
I'm a growin' girl #

53:23.733 --> 53:29.194
# I offer big love with no apology #

53:29.239 --> 53:33.573
# How can I deny
the world the most of me? #

53:33.610 --> 53:38.377
# I am not afraid
to throw my weight around #

53:38.415 --> 53:42.044
# Pound by pound by pound #

53:42.085 --> 53:47.819
# Because I'm big,
blonde and beautiful #

53:47.857 --> 53:52.453
# Face the fact,
it's simply irrefutable #

53:52.495 --> 53:56.829
# No one wants a meal
that only offers the least #

53:56.866 --> 54:00.768
# When, girl, we're servin'
up the whole damn feast #

54:02.939 --> 54:06.568
Well, looks like y'all
took a step outta bounds.

54:06.610 --> 54:07.634
Now, who we got here?

54:07.677 --> 54:09.611
Mom, I want you to meet my new friends.

54:09.646 --> 54:12.240
This here is Link. Tracy Turnblad.

54:12.282 --> 54:15.547
This is just so afro-tastic!

54:15.585 --> 54:17.382
And this young lady right here...

54:17.420 --> 54:19.320
is Penny Pingleton.

54:21.324 --> 54:23.417
I'm very pleased
and scared to be here.

54:23.460 --> 54:27.920
Oh, now, honey. We got more reason
to be scared on your street.

54:27.964 --> 54:29.829
Latoya, put that record down.

54:29.866 --> 54:31.094
You gonna scratch it.

54:31.134 --> 54:32.101
Can't you keep your little girl...

54:32.135 --> 54:33.102
Shall we dance?

54:33.136 --> 54:34.330
Come on.

54:35.605 --> 54:37.129
My name is Mike.

54:37.173 --> 54:38.265
Mike?

54:38.308 --> 54:40.003
Yes, Mike.

54:40.043 --> 54:41.101
Mike who?

54:41.144 --> 54:42.270
It's Mike.

54:42.312 --> 54:44.280
Anyway, ahem...

54:44.314 --> 54:46.214
I'm calling because
I have some information...

54:46.249 --> 54:47.910
about your daughter's whereabouts.

54:47.951 --> 54:49.714
- What?
- Right now, as we speak...

54:49.753 --> 54:53.280
your daughter has entered
a hotbed of moral...

54:53.323 --> 54:55.188
turpentine.

54:55.225 --> 54:57.693
# Baby don't sleep #

54:57.727 --> 54:59.854
# Baby don't eat #

54:59.896 --> 55:04.799
# Baby just like another boink-boink #

55:04.834 --> 55:07.735
Link, aren't you gonna get
in awful trouble for this?

55:07.771 --> 55:09.568
I'm not plannin' on tellin' my dad.

55:09.606 --> 55:12.074
No, I mean in trouble
with someone else.

55:12.108 --> 55:14.804
Hmm. Maybe.

55:14.844 --> 55:16.812
Maybe it's worth it.

55:16.846 --> 55:20.111
I think knowin' you's the start
of a pretty big adventure.

55:20.150 --> 55:21.139
Ahh!

55:23.019 --> 55:25.681
Tracy Edna Turnblad!

55:26.856 --> 55:28.949
Ooh, we get any more
white people in here...

55:28.992 --> 55:30.482
this gonna be a suburb.

55:32.862 --> 55:34.762
Do you know what I had to pay a cab...

55:34.798 --> 55:36.265
just to consider comin' down here?

55:36.299 --> 55:37.789
Oh, uh, Mom-

55:37.834 --> 55:39.995
No call. You just disappear.

55:40.036 --> 55:42.504
And all mashed up against a crooner?

55:42.539 --> 55:45.997
Um, Edna Turnblad, this is Link.

55:47.210 --> 55:48.837
Come on, we're goin'.

55:48.878 --> 55:51.312
And, Penny, go home before
your mother shoots you.

55:51.348 --> 55:52.542
Miss Edna, is it?

55:52.582 --> 55:54.846
Hi, I mean, you don't
have to rush off, you know.

55:54.884 --> 55:57.045
Well, I do. I left my iron on.

55:57.087 --> 55:58.748
Oh, your iron.

55:58.788 --> 56:00.119
Well, before you go...

56:00.156 --> 56:01.817
you sure you
wouldn't like to have...

56:01.858 --> 56:04.520
a little somethin' to eat?

56:04.561 --> 56:06.722
Mmm-mmm.

56:14.671 --> 56:16.400
Is that braised?

56:16.439 --> 56:20.702
# Whoa oh oh oh oh oh #

56:20.744 --> 56:24.475
# Slice me off a piece
of that hogshead cheese #

56:24.514 --> 56:25.503
# Whoo! #

56:25.548 --> 56:26.776
# And take a look inside #

56:26.816 --> 56:29.649
# My book of recipes #

56:29.686 --> 56:34.453
# Now, don't-cha sniff around
for somethin' fluffy and light #

56:34.491 --> 56:39.121
# We need a man who brings
a man-size appetite #

56:39.162 --> 56:44.293
# We'll use a pinch-a sugar
and a dash-a spice #

56:44.334 --> 56:48.862
# I'll let you lick the spoon
because it tastes so nice #

56:48.905 --> 56:53.035
# We keep it in the oven
till it's good and hot #

56:53.076 --> 56:57.376
# Keep on stirrin' till it hits the spot #

56:57.414 --> 57:02.852
# Because I'm big,
blonde and beautiful #

57:02.886 --> 57:07.550
# There is nothin' 'bout us
that's unsuitable #

57:07.590 --> 57:11.492
# Why sit in the bleachers
timid and afraid #

57:11.528 --> 57:16.397
# When, Edna, you look
like the whole parade? #

57:16.433 --> 57:19.402
# They say that white
has might and thin is in #

57:19.436 --> 57:20.960
# Well, that's just bull #

57:21.004 --> 57:22.938
# 'Cause, ladies, big is back #

57:22.972 --> 57:26.271
# And as for black, it's beautiful #

57:26.309 --> 57:28.174
# All shapes and sizes follow me #

57:28.211 --> 57:35.447
# Who wants a twig when
you can climb a whole tree #

57:35.601 --> 57:37.068
# Yeah, yeah #

57:37.102 --> 57:43.041
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #

57:43.075 --> 57:45.566
Groovy, baby. Groovy.

57:54.620 --> 57:56.087
Hello?

58:20.346 --> 58:21.711
Hello?!

58:31.890 --> 58:33.289
- Graah!
- Oh, my God!

58:33.325 --> 58:36.055
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Ah! You got me.

58:36.095 --> 58:37.585
Ha ha ha!

58:37.630 --> 58:41.066
Welcome, mmm,
to the Hardy-Har Hut.

58:41.100 --> 58:44.092
If we can't put a smile on your face,
your skin's too tight.

58:44.136 --> 58:46.104
- Oh!
- Bop, bop.

58:46.138 --> 58:48.265
- Oh.
- I got somethin' for ya. Yeah.

58:48.307 --> 58:49.604
It's just in.

58:49.642 --> 58:50.939
You're gonna love it.

58:50.976 --> 58:52.273
Huh?

58:52.311 --> 58:53.972
Oh.

58:54.013 --> 58:55.878
Cigarette?

58:57.149 --> 58:58.776
Ha ha ha.

58:58.817 --> 59:02.685
Tempting but, uh... no, thanks.

59:02.721 --> 59:03.949
- Ha ha ha!
- Oh.

59:03.989 --> 59:05.786
Well, eh.

59:07.393 --> 59:08.917
What can I do you for?

59:08.961 --> 59:10.189
Something for the mister?

59:10.229 --> 59:14.256
Sadly, there is no mister at the moment.

59:14.299 --> 59:16.164
Beautiful woman like yourself?

59:16.201 --> 59:18.328
My husband...

59:21.106 --> 59:23.370
...accidentally suffocated.

59:23.409 --> 59:24.808
You need a fella.

59:24.843 --> 59:28.711
I do. I do need a fella.

59:28.747 --> 59:33.514
And the way to a man's heart
is through his funny bone.

59:33.552 --> 59:35.850
Now here's an icebreaker for ya.

59:38.190 --> 59:40.886
Oh, Miss Maybelle,
you do throw a lovely party.

59:40.926 --> 59:42.894
But what are you celebratin'?

59:43.862 --> 59:45.659
Well, it's kind of an ending.

59:45.698 --> 59:48.132
But it deserved to go out with a bang.

59:48.167 --> 59:49.964
What ended?

59:51.537 --> 59:52.697
Negro Day.

59:52.738 --> 59:54.330
What?

59:54.373 --> 59:57.467
All right. Time y'all knew.

59:57.509 --> 01:00:01.570
velma von Tussle just told me
we have had our last show.

01:00:01.613 --> 01:00:03.103
No.

01:00:03.148 --> 01:00:05.514
Yeah, it seems our little show
was a nice little placeholder...

01:00:05.551 --> 01:00:07.712
- but it was time to get some ratings.
- Aww!

01:00:07.753 --> 01:00:10.051
I didn't wanna tell y'all up front.

01:00:10.089 --> 01:00:12.717
I just wanted to have a little fun tonight.

01:00:12.758 --> 01:00:15.056
But I practiced so hard.

01:00:15.094 --> 01:00:17.654
Now I'll never get a chance
to be on the show.

01:00:17.696 --> 01:00:19.391
Oh, you will be seen, baby.

01:00:19.431 --> 01:00:20.420
I promise.

01:00:20.466 --> 01:00:22.093
You can't have your own show?

01:00:22.134 --> 01:00:23.601
Fine, you'll come dance with us.

01:00:23.635 --> 01:00:25.227
Hmm. Honey.

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:27.067
You been dozin' off durin' history?

01:00:27.106 --> 01:00:29.233
Yes, always.

01:00:29.274 --> 01:00:32.243
Trace, black and whites ain't never danced
on Tv together.

01:00:32.277 --> 01:00:34.768
Well, if we can't dance...

01:00:34.813 --> 01:00:37.941
maybe we should just march.

01:00:40.252 --> 01:00:42.243
Ooh, that'd get some big ol' ratin's.

01:00:42.287 --> 01:00:43.879
Better time slot, too.

01:00:43.922 --> 01:00:44.911
Mm-hmm.

01:00:44.957 --> 01:00:47.016
Like on the 11:00 news.

01:00:47.059 --> 01:00:48.026
Ahh!

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.391
What y'all say?

01:00:49.428 --> 01:00:50.986
Should we give this fine woman...

01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:52.257
all the ratings she deserves?

01:00:52.297 --> 01:00:54.026
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:00:54.066 --> 01:00:55.397
Hey, hey!

01:00:55.434 --> 01:00:57.800
Well, it is a school night...

01:00:57.836 --> 01:00:59.360
and I think we oughta call it a night.

01:00:59.404 --> 01:01:02.305
Tell you what.
We meet up at the church Friday, 4:00...

01:01:02.341 --> 01:01:05.469
<i>and we will march on WYZT.</i>

01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:07.741
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:08.769
Yeah!

01:01:08.814 --> 01:01:10.577
Tracy, you can't protest, hon.

01:01:10.616 --> 01:01:12.607
I mean, these are lovely people...

01:01:12.651 --> 01:01:14.414
but if you protest, you'll be on lists.

01:01:14.453 --> 01:01:16.011
You'll be on files.

01:01:16.054 --> 01:01:18.215
J. Edgar Hoover'll be still wiretappin'...

01:01:18.257 --> 01:01:20.088
your cold, dead body in the grave.

01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:21.251
Oh, Mother.

01:01:21.293 --> 01:01:24.262
Link, we're going with them, right?

01:01:24.296 --> 01:01:26.526
Walk with me.

01:01:26.565 --> 01:01:30.331
You want your Belgian chocolate
animal droppings.

01:01:32.304 --> 01:01:34.602
Dot dot. This store's for you.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.804
- Oh! What a treasure trove.
- Huh?

01:01:38.844 --> 01:01:41.506
Come here, baby.

01:01:41.547 --> 01:01:43.276
Don't be sad.

01:01:43.315 --> 01:01:45.146
We gonna make it happen, OK?

01:01:45.184 --> 01:01:46.276
Can I go?

01:01:46.318 --> 01:01:47.649
Now, come on, now.

01:01:47.686 --> 01:01:49.017
I can't be worried about you out there.

01:01:50.556 --> 01:01:52.456
Trace...

01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:55.153
I been smilin' and dancin'
on this show for 3 years.

01:01:56.328 --> 01:01:57.556
Mrs. von Tussle just promised...

01:01:57.596 --> 01:01:59.291
I could sing at the Miss Hairspray pageant.

01:01:59.331 --> 01:02:02.300
She's-she invited agents.

01:02:02.334 --> 01:02:04.632
That's my shot, Trace.

01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:06.365
I can't jeopardize that.

01:02:06.405 --> 01:02:08.600
But it's what's right.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.471
I'm sorry, Trace.

01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:13.307
I just think this adventure's...

01:02:13.345 --> 01:02:14.642
a little...

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.977
too big for me.

01:02:18.717 --> 01:02:20.378
Oh, God. No, no, no.
That's not what I-

01:02:20.419 --> 01:02:22.478
I get it, Link. It's your shot.

01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:23.920
No, Trace, that's not what I-

01:02:23.956 --> 01:02:24.945
It's fine.

01:02:27.893 --> 01:02:29.360
Oh, hon.

01:02:32.998 --> 01:02:35.057
I should go.

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.658
Give him time.

01:02:36.702 --> 01:02:38.727
He'll figure out he's crazy 'bout you.

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:42.001
You have to say that,
you're my mother.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:45.271
Well, I know a little
somethin' about men.

01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:49.542
And, my personal favorite,
x- ray specs.

01:02:49.581 --> 01:02:51.276
You can see through anything.

01:02:51.316 --> 01:02:54.877
Skin, clothes, you name it.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.251
Now, take your father.

01:02:56.288 --> 01:02:59.121
And he's always downstairs
in that shop workin' late.

01:02:59.157 --> 01:03:01.557
Do I take it personal? No.

01:03:01.593 --> 01:03:04.221
Men always put their career first.

01:03:04.263 --> 01:03:05.457
Remember that.

01:03:05.497 --> 01:03:06.589
OK.

01:03:06.632 --> 01:03:08.725
I'm really tired, I'm gonna go to bed.

01:03:08.767 --> 01:03:09.893
All right, hon.

01:03:09.935 --> 01:03:10.902
Night.

01:03:10.936 --> 01:03:13.063
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:03:13.105 --> 01:03:15.130
I think I'm gonna go to bed, too.

01:03:15.173 --> 01:03:17.107
Oh, I'm so tired.

01:03:22.781 --> 01:03:26.080
You don't need those...

01:03:26.118 --> 01:03:29.246
to see what's under these clothes.

01:03:29.288 --> 01:03:31.984
There's a product that really works...

01:03:32.024 --> 01:03:34.618
'cause these are phony
as a three dollar bill.

01:03:38.664 --> 01:03:40.564
Incredible!

01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:42.464
I could do a fan dance with a lettuce leaf...

01:03:42.501 --> 01:03:45.664
and you would remain completely obtuse.

01:03:45.704 --> 01:03:46.671
Obtuse.

01:03:46.705 --> 01:03:48.229
Yes, obtuse.

01:03:48.273 --> 01:03:50.002
I flunked geometry.

01:03:50.042 --> 01:03:52.738
Yeah, well-and biology too, no doubt!

01:03:52.778 --> 01:03:54.370
Yeah.

01:03:55.814 --> 01:03:57.805
Wait! How 'bout this?

01:03:57.849 --> 01:03:59.316
OK.

01:04:01.887 --> 01:04:04.253
# Those lips, those eyes #

01:04:04.289 --> 01:04:05.620
# That food #

01:04:05.657 --> 01:04:07.989
# Well, there ain't nothin' like a spread #

01:04:08.026 --> 01:04:09.926
# To get ya in the mood #

01:04:09.962 --> 01:04:14.399
# Wilbur, can't ya feel the
burnin' flame of hot desire #

01:04:14.433 --> 01:04:16.924
# You're gonna need
more than some seltzer #

01:04:16.969 --> 01:04:19.437
# To put out this fire #

01:04:19.471 --> 01:04:22.963
# I'm wailin': "look out, old Balti- #

01:04:23.008 --> 01:04:24.999
# "- more" I'm sellin' somethin' #

01:04:25.043 --> 01:04:28.376
# You can't purchase
at a ten-cent store #

01:04:28.413 --> 01:04:30.847
# Oh, Wilbur, I feel like a princess #

01:04:30.882 --> 01:04:32.543
# Come on and take me to the ball #

01:04:32.584 --> 01:04:35.382
# I bet you're tired of heavy lifting #

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.581
# Get your hands on somethin' small #

01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:40.317
# Because I'm a-big- #

01:04:40.359 --> 01:04:41.553
# -blonde- #

01:04:41.593 --> 01:04:43.686
# -and beautiful #

01:04:43.729 --> 01:04:45.788
# It's time to face the facts #

01:04:45.831 --> 01:04:48.356
# It's irrefutable #

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.300
# Why waste one more minute #

01:04:50.335 --> 01:04:52.530
# Now I feel brand spankin' new #

01:04:52.571 --> 01:04:54.129
# Hey, Wilbur, take a look #

01:04:54.172 --> 01:04:55.230
# It's all for #

01:04:55.273 --> 01:04:56.535
You!

01:04:56.575 --> 01:04:58.873
You?!

01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:59.877
Ohh!

01:04:59.911 --> 01:05:01.003
Edna.

01:05:01.046 --> 01:05:04.641
Your wife! You said she was out! Oh!
Wait a minute!

01:05:04.683 --> 01:05:05.877
Hi, hon.

01:05:07.552 --> 01:05:10.749
Ma, you don't really believe
that he would do that.

01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:13.223
You are never setting foot
on that show again.

01:05:13.258 --> 01:05:14.850
You hear me?

01:05:14.893 --> 01:05:18.556
I heard you the first 400 times, Ma.

01:05:41.186 --> 01:05:43.347
- Hey.
- Huh.

01:05:43.388 --> 01:05:44.650
Oh.

01:05:49.094 --> 01:05:50.061
Daddy.

01:05:51.096 --> 01:05:53.257
It wasn't me.

01:05:53.298 --> 01:05:56.165
I had to improvise
a bed out of something.

01:05:56.201 --> 01:05:57.600
Whoopee cushions?

01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:00.929
That will play heck with my sciatica.

01:06:01.973 --> 01:06:04.168
Oop. That one was me.

01:06:04.209 --> 01:06:06.404
Oh. Oh.

01:06:06.445 --> 01:06:08.777
Daddy, are you OK?

01:06:08.814 --> 01:06:10.577
Ohh.

01:06:10.615 --> 01:06:13.812
Tracy, you know...

01:06:13.852 --> 01:06:18.789
these peepers have never
looked at another woman.

01:06:18.824 --> 01:06:22.191
This heart only beats for size 60.

01:06:22.227 --> 01:06:25.594
Daddy, you know what velma wanted.

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:27.757
She wanted me off the show.

01:06:27.799 --> 01:06:32.133
And I knew that,
but how could she go that far?

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:35.435
Come here. Come here, little girl.

01:06:35.474 --> 01:06:37.772
Little girl.

01:06:37.809 --> 01:06:41.472
And then to just cancel
Negro Day like that.

01:06:41.513 --> 01:06:44.380
Just to make sure that
nobody who's different...

01:06:44.416 --> 01:06:46.577
or who's black or Chinese...

01:06:46.618 --> 01:06:49.246
or maybe who needs to lose a few pounds.

01:06:49.287 --> 01:06:51.255
What are you talking? Stop it.

01:06:51.289 --> 01:06:53.951
What are you talking?

01:06:53.992 --> 01:06:56.222
I think I've been in a bubble or something.

01:06:56.261 --> 01:06:59.958
Thinking that fairness
was just going to happen.

01:06:59.998 --> 01:07:01.522
It's not.

01:07:01.566 --> 01:07:04.797
I think people like me
are gonna have to get up...

01:07:04.836 --> 01:07:09.170
off their father's laps and go
out there and fight for it.

01:07:16.681 --> 01:07:19.115
Ahh. Your mother and I...

01:07:19.151 --> 01:07:21.483
We don't see too far
past our front door.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.081
But you... see all the way to Schenectady.

01:07:25.123 --> 01:07:28.991
So, if there's something
you need to stand up for...

01:07:29.027 --> 01:07:32.554
don't ya listen to old dogs like us.

01:07:32.597 --> 01:07:35.828
We need to learn some new tricks...

01:07:35.867 --> 01:07:37.266
from you.

01:07:37.302 --> 01:07:40.169
You don't need new tricks, Dad.

01:07:40.205 --> 01:07:42.139
You need Mom.

01:07:48.213 --> 01:07:50.511
She changed the locks.

01:07:56.288 --> 01:07:57.812
Oh.

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:03.721
Good night, Daddy.

01:08:12.404 --> 01:08:15.896
Aw, wow.

01:08:15.941 --> 01:08:17.738
Come on, baby.

01:08:22.113 --> 01:08:23.876
Honey, took me 5 years...

01:08:23.915 --> 01:08:26.076
to figure out you were flirting.

01:08:26.117 --> 01:08:28.415
How could I ever?

01:08:30.087 --> 01:08:32.420
Well, she is very glamorous.

01:08:32.457 --> 01:08:34.823
Edna.

01:08:38.897 --> 01:08:42.060
She just makes me feel old.

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.590
Nonsense.

01:08:43.635 --> 01:08:45.466
Doll!

01:08:45.502 --> 01:08:47.437
You're spry as a Slinky.

01:08:49.573 --> 01:08:51.837
I'm not talkin' to you.

01:08:51.876 --> 01:08:56.245
# Styles keep a-changin',
the world's rearrangin' #

01:08:56.281 --> 01:09:00.411
# But, Edna,
you're timeless to me #

01:09:00.452 --> 01:09:04.081
# Hemlines are shorter,
a beer costs a quarter #

01:09:04.122 --> 01:09:09.252
# But time cannot take what comes free #

01:09:09.294 --> 01:09:12.593
# You're like a stinky old cheese, babe #

01:09:12.631 --> 01:09:17.261
# Just gettin' riper with age #

01:09:17.301 --> 01:09:19.770
# You're like a fatal disease, babe #

01:09:19.804 --> 01:09:21.066
What?

01:09:21.106 --> 01:09:24.939
# But there's no cure,
so let this fever rage #

01:09:24.975 --> 01:09:28.969
# Some folks can't stand it,
say time is a bandit #

01:09:29.014 --> 01:09:32.779
# But I take the opposite view #

01:09:32.817 --> 01:09:35.411
# 'Cause when I need a lift #

01:09:35.453 --> 01:09:37.216
# Time brings a gift #

01:09:37.255 --> 01:09:41.316
# Another day with you #

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:43.122
# A twist or a waltz #

01:09:43.161 --> 01:09:45.287
# It's all the same schmaltz #

01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:48.959
# With just a change in the scenery #

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.332
# You'll never be old hat #

01:09:51.368 --> 01:09:52.358
# That's that #

01:09:52.404 --> 01:09:55.339
# You're timeless to me #

01:09:58.009 --> 01:09:59.806
# Fads keep a-fadin' #

01:09:59.844 --> 01:10:02.005
# Castro's invadin' #

01:10:02.047 --> 01:10:05.915
# But, Wilbur,
you're timeless to me #

01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:07.645
# Hairdos are higher #

01:10:07.686 --> 01:10:09.813
# Mine feels like barbed wire #

01:10:09.854 --> 01:10:14.052
# But you say I'm chic as can be #

01:10:14.092 --> 01:10:17.186
# You're like a rare vintage ripple #

01:10:17.228 --> 01:10:18.286
Thank you.

01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:22.323
# A vintage they'll never forget #

01:10:22.367 --> 01:10:25.928
# So pour me a teeny-weeny triple #

01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:27.494
Any time!

01:10:27.539 --> 01:10:29.837
# And we can toast the fact
we ain't dead yet #

01:10:29.874 --> 01:10:30.841
What?

01:10:30.875 --> 01:10:32.502
# I can't stop eating #

01:10:32.544 --> 01:10:34.239
# Your hairline's receding #

01:10:34.279 --> 01:10:35.405
Hey.

01:10:35.447 --> 01:10:37.506
# And soon
you'll have nothing at all #

01:10:37.549 --> 01:10:38.811
Never.

01:10:38.850 --> 01:10:41.080
# So you'll wear a wig #

01:10:41.119 --> 01:10:42.643
# While I roast a pig #

01:10:42.687 --> 01:10:45.554
# Hey! Pass that Geritol #

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:46.852
I love pig.

01:10:46.891 --> 01:10:48.984
# Glenn Miller had brass #

01:10:49.027 --> 01:10:51.052
# That Chubby Checker's a gas #

01:10:51.096 --> 01:10:54.691
# But they all pass eventually #

01:10:54.733 --> 01:10:58.032
# You'll never be passé, hip-hooray #

01:10:58.069 --> 01:11:01.232
# You're timeless to me #

01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:14.743
Heh heh heh!

01:11:23.128 --> 01:11:24.425
Grrr!

01:11:52.857 --> 01:11:56.258
# You're like a broken-down Chevy #

01:11:56.294 --> 01:12:00.287
# All I need is a fresh coat of paint #

01:12:00.331 --> 01:12:04.734
# And, Edna, ya got me
goin' hot and heavy #

01:12:04.769 --> 01:12:06.566
# You're fat and old #

01:12:06.604 --> 01:12:09.266
- What?
- # But, baby, boring you ain't #

01:12:09.307 --> 01:12:11.172
# Some folks don't get it #

01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:13.200
# But we never fret it #

01:12:13.244 --> 01:12:16.771
# 'Cause we know
that time is our friend #

01:12:16.815 --> 01:12:19.113
# Yeah, it's plain to see #

01:12:19.150 --> 01:12:21.380
# That you're stuck with me #

01:12:21.419 --> 01:12:25.355
# Until the bitter end #

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:29.292
# And we got a kid who's blowin' the lid #

01:12:29.327 --> 01:12:32.785
# Off the Turnblad family tree #

01:12:32.831 --> 01:12:35.197
# You'll always hit the spot #

01:12:35.233 --> 01:12:36.860
# Big shot #

01:12:36.901 --> 01:12:39.529
# You're timeless to me #

01:12:41.172 --> 01:12:45.131
<i># You'll always be du jour, mon amour #</i>

01:12:45.176 --> 01:12:47.644
# You're timeless to me #

01:12:52.684 --> 01:12:57.121
# You'll always be first string #

01:12:57.155 --> 01:13:00.420
# Ring-a-ding-ding #

# You're timeless #

01:13:18.543 --> 01:13:27.679
# To me #

01:13:27.719 --> 01:13:29.050
Oh, Wilbur.

01:13:34.325 --> 01:13:36.122
Tracy.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.559
Wake up, hon.

01:13:37.595 --> 01:13:41.031
Wake up. Everything's good again.

01:13:42.767 --> 01:13:45.065
Wilbur! Wilbur!

01:13:45.103 --> 01:13:46.229
Uhh!

01:13:47.572 --> 01:13:51.030
Seaweed, help pass
those signs out.

01:13:51.075 --> 01:13:52.542
Give her one.

01:13:52.577 --> 01:13:54.374
Hey, Jackie, we're over here.

01:13:54.412 --> 01:13:57.074
Aw, you
lookin' good, Gertrude.

01:13:57.115 --> 01:13:59.083
C'mon, y'all.
Here we go now.

01:14:01.786 --> 01:14:02.946
Tracy!

01:14:04.756 --> 01:14:06.883
You're gonna pay a heavy price.

01:14:06.925 --> 01:14:08.256
I know.

01:14:08.293 --> 01:14:10.193
You'll never dance on Tv again.

01:14:10.228 --> 01:14:12.526
If I can't dance
with Seaweed and Little Inez...

01:14:12.564 --> 01:14:15.032
then I don't wanna dance on Tv at all.

01:14:15.066 --> 01:14:18.399
I just want tomorrow to be better.

01:14:18.436 --> 01:14:21.872
# There's a light #

01:14:21.906 --> 01:14:26.605
# In the darkness #

01:14:26.644 --> 01:14:34.107
# Though the night
is black as my skin #

01:14:34.152 --> 01:14:39.385
# There's a light burnin' bright #

01:14:39.424 --> 01:14:43.258
# Showing me the way #

01:14:45.463 --> 01:14:50.127
# But I know where I've been #

01:14:51.302 --> 01:14:55.602
# There's a cry #

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.973
# In the distance #

01:14:59.010 --> 01:15:05.745
# It's a voice that comes
from deep within #

01:15:05.783 --> 01:15:08.274
# Hey, yeah #

01:15:08.319 --> 01:15:11.948
# There's a cry askin' why #

01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:16.324
# I pray the answer's up ahead #

01:15:18.496 --> 01:15:24.264
# 'Cause I know where I've been #

01:15:28.873 --> 01:15:32.707
# There's a road #

01:15:32.744 --> 01:15:36.908
# We been travelin' #

01:15:36.948 --> 01:15:41.146
# Lost so many #

01:15:41.185 --> 01:15:43.847
# On the way #

01:15:45.523 --> 01:15:53.225
# But the riches will be plenty #

01:15:53.264 --> 01:15:55.892
# Worth the price #

01:15:55.933 --> 01:16:01.838
# The price we had to pay #

01:16:01.873 --> 01:16:05.832
# There's a dream #

01:16:05.877 --> 01:16:09.813
- # In the future #
- # Ooh-ooh #

01:16:09.847 --> 01:16:12.441
# There's a struggle #

01:16:12.483 --> 01:16:16.613
# That we have yet to win #

01:16:18.389 --> 01:16:22.348
# And there's pride in my heart #

01:16:22.393 --> 01:16:27.023
# 'Cause I know where I'm goin' #

01:16:27.065 --> 01:16:29.033
# Yes, I do #

01:16:29.067 --> 01:16:34.198
# And I know where I've been #

01:16:34.238 --> 01:16:35.205
# Yeah #

01:16:35.239 --> 01:16:38.800
# There's a road #

01:16:38.843 --> 01:16:43.206
# We must travel #

01:16:43.247 --> 01:16:45.374
# There's a promise #

01:16:45.416 --> 01:16:47.714
# There is a promise #

01:16:47.752 --> 01:16:49.117
# We must make #

01:16:49.153 --> 01:16:51.383
# That we must make #

01:16:51.422 --> 01:16:53.390
# But the riches #

01:16:53.424 --> 01:16:55.619
# Oh, but the riches #

01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:56.718
# Will be plenty #

01:16:56.761 --> 01:16:59.730
# The riches will be plenty, yeah #

01:16:59.764 --> 01:17:01.891
# Worth the risk #

01:17:01.933 --> 01:17:04.060
# And the chances that we take #

01:17:04.102 --> 01:17:08.061
# And the chances we take #

01:17:08.106 --> 01:17:10.836
# There's a dream #

01:17:10.875 --> 01:17:16.745
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, in the future #

01:17:16.781 --> 01:17:18.078
# There's a struggle #

01:17:18.116 --> 01:17:19.083
# Struggle #

01:17:19.117 --> 01:17:21.847
# That we have yet to win #

01:17:21.886 --> 01:17:24.582
# We have yet to win #

01:17:24.622 --> 01:17:26.419
# Use that pride #

01:17:26.457 --> 01:17:27.424
# Pride #

01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:29.426
# In our hearts #

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.427
# To lift us up #

01:17:30.461 --> 01:17:31.428
# Lift us up #

01:17:31.462 --> 01:17:33.521
# Until tomorrow #

01:17:33.564 --> 01:17:34.758
# Oooh #

01:17:34.799 --> 01:17:40.396
# 'Cause just to sit
still would be a sin #

01:17:40.438 --> 01:17:44.101
# I know it, I know it,
I know where I'm goin' #

01:17:44.142 --> 01:17:52.277
# Lord knows I know #

01:17:52.316 --> 01:17:56.616
# Where I've been #

01:17:56.654 --> 01:17:58.622
# Oh, when we win #

01:17:58.656 --> 01:18:02.285
# Yeah, I'll give thanks to my God #

01:18:02.326 --> 01:18:07.127
# 'Cause I know where I've been #

01:18:07.165 --> 01:18:12.296
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

01:18:12.336 --> 01:18:14.634
Oh, yeah, amen!

01:18:14.672 --> 01:18:15.639
Amen, amen!

01:18:15.673 --> 01:18:16.867
That's right.

01:18:16.908 --> 01:18:19.877
Tracy, hon, you don't
know what you're doing.

01:18:19.911 --> 01:18:21.401
Yes, I do, Ma.

01:18:21.445 --> 01:18:22.434
Hello, Miss Maybelle.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.469
Well, good evening, Miss Edna.

01:18:23.514 --> 01:18:24.572
Nice-a you to join us.

01:18:24.615 --> 01:18:25.809
She's got a lovely turnout.

01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:27.545
Now I really think they
don't need you anymore.

01:18:27.585 --> 01:18:28.745
You come home with me.

01:18:28.786 --> 01:18:31.380
Oh.

01:18:31.422 --> 01:18:33.652
No, we are not sending a camera crew.

01:18:33.691 --> 01:18:37.024
They're protesting
our own station, dimwit.

01:18:38.196 --> 01:18:39.857
Why is Channel Five there?

01:18:41.199 --> 01:18:43.667
Well, of course they're all Negroes.

01:18:43.701 --> 01:18:45.134
And why would-?

01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:48.332
Ahh! Ohh.

01:18:48.372 --> 01:18:49.703
I know who would.

01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:51.833
Oh, I know exactly who would.

01:18:51.876 --> 01:18:53.844
2, 4, 6, 8!

01:18:53.878 --> 01:18:55.903
Tv's got to integrate!

01:18:55.947 --> 01:18:59.747
2, 4, 6, 8! Tv's got to integrate!

01:18:59.784 --> 01:19:00.751
2, 4, 6, 8!

01:19:00.785 --> 01:19:02.184
Oh, my God, no!

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:03.346
Tv's got to integrate!

01:19:03.387 --> 01:19:04.479
- No!
- Ma, come on.

01:19:04.522 --> 01:19:05.648
The sound's not working.

01:19:05.690 --> 01:19:06.884
You knew there'd be police.

01:19:06.924 --> 01:19:09.552
- But I didn't know there'd be cameras.
- So?

01:19:09.594 --> 01:19:12.062
Oh, I cannot be seen on television
at this present weight.

01:19:12.096 --> 01:19:13.563
2, 4, 6, 8!

01:19:13.598 --> 01:19:15.498
Tv's got to integrate!

01:19:15.533 --> 01:19:17.364
2, 4, 6, 8!

01:19:17.401 --> 01:19:19.494
Tv's got to integrate!

01:19:19.537 --> 01:19:21.334
2, 4, 6, 8!

01:19:21.372 --> 01:19:22.339
Tv's got to integrate!

01:19:22.373 --> 01:19:23.567
Excuse me.

01:19:23.608 --> 01:19:25.769
Is there some reason
we can't pass by peacefully?

01:19:25.810 --> 01:19:28.142
I strongly suggest you
and your little friends...

01:19:28.179 --> 01:19:30.909
head back to where you come from.

01:19:30.948 --> 01:19:32.074
Hey, you don't have to be so rude.

01:19:32.116 --> 01:19:33.174
Tracy!

01:19:33.217 --> 01:19:35.208
It's all right, Tracy.
I can handle this.

01:19:35.253 --> 01:19:37.221
'Scuse me. She was talking to you.

01:19:37.255 --> 01:19:39.052
- Oh, Tracy!
- Oh!

01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:40.887
Tracy, no.

01:19:40.925 --> 01:19:42.859
You just assaulted a police officer, miss.

01:19:42.894 --> 01:19:44.919
- No!
- I what?!

01:19:44.962 --> 01:19:45.929
Assaulted?!

01:19:45.963 --> 01:19:48.591
Enough! Hey!

01:19:50.234 --> 01:19:51.895
All right, boys.

01:19:51.936 --> 01:19:54.097
Let's take the whole lot in.

01:19:54.138 --> 01:19:56.072
- No!
- Run, Tracy! Run!

01:19:56.107 --> 01:19:59.736
2, 4, 6, 8! Tv's got to integrate!

01:19:59.777 --> 01:20:02.905
2, 4, 6, 8!
Tv's got to integrate!

01:20:02.947 --> 01:20:06.075
2, 4, 6, 8! Tv's got to integrate!

01:20:06.117 --> 01:20:09.109
2, 4, 6, 8!
Tv's got to integrate!

01:20:09.153 --> 01:20:11.621
And our cameras also
caught Tracy Turnblad...

01:20:11.656 --> 01:20:14.750
the teenage Tv personality
and rabble-rouser.

01:20:14.792 --> 01:20:16.589
Miss Turnblad brutally
attacked a sergeant...

01:20:16.627 --> 01:20:18.151
with a blunt instrument
before fleeing the scene...

01:20:18.195 --> 01:20:20.925
You see? You see?

01:20:20.965 --> 01:20:23.024
If I let you leave the house...

01:20:23.067 --> 01:20:25.592
right now you'd be in prison
fighting whores for cigarettes.

01:20:25.636 --> 01:20:27.934
That Tracy Turnblad always
was a bad influence.

01:20:27.972 --> 01:20:31.373
Well, you are never, ever gonna see that
beehived harlot again.

01:20:31.409 --> 01:20:33.309
OK, Mother. Excuse me.

01:20:33.344 --> 01:20:34.436
Penny?

01:20:34.478 --> 01:20:36.207
Pray for her.

01:20:36.247 --> 01:20:38.875
She's gonna need it.

01:20:40.217 --> 01:20:42.014
Tracy! Tracy!

01:20:42.053 --> 01:20:44.920
She's not here, I told you.

01:20:44.956 --> 01:20:46.617
Hon, she knows...

01:20:46.657 --> 01:20:48.090
if the cops are lookin' for her...

01:20:48.125 --> 01:20:50.491
this is the first place they'll come.

01:20:52.997 --> 01:20:55.966
What this must-a put you through, Wilbur.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.433
I'm so sorry.

01:20:57.468 --> 01:20:58.457
I'm not.

01:20:58.502 --> 01:20:59.469
You're not?

01:20:59.503 --> 01:21:00.470
I'm proud-a you.

01:21:00.504 --> 01:21:01.630
You are?

01:21:01.672 --> 01:21:04.334
Baby, somebody had to do somethin'.

01:21:04.375 --> 01:21:08.311
'Course, we may be eating beans
for the next 10 years.

01:21:09.513 --> 01:21:11.174
Bail for 20's kind of pricey.

01:21:11.215 --> 01:21:13.149
You bailed all those people out?

01:21:13.184 --> 01:21:14.651
Ya upset with me?

01:21:14.685 --> 01:21:15.811
I'm sorry.

01:21:15.853 --> 01:21:18.617
Hon, it just seemed like the right thing.

01:21:18.656 --> 01:21:21.716
Oh, Wilbur, it was the right thing.

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:26.728
Knights in armor
don't come any shinier than you.

01:21:26.764 --> 01:21:28.732
But where's our little girl?

01:21:31.502 --> 01:21:32.833
Are you OK, Trace?

01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:34.701
Oh, you have no idea.

01:21:35.906 --> 01:21:36.998
Come on.

01:21:37.041 --> 01:21:38.008
Thank you so much.

01:21:38.042 --> 01:21:39.839
You're such a great friend.

01:21:39.877 --> 01:21:41.674
Thanks.

01:21:41.712 --> 01:21:44.180
Penny, the cops are looking for me
everywhere.

01:21:44.215 --> 01:21:46.149
You could go to jail for helping me.

01:21:46.183 --> 01:21:48.811
Tracy, I'm already in jail. Come on.

01:21:51.522 --> 01:21:52.511
Oh, no.

01:21:52.556 --> 01:21:54.023
- What?
- Your hair deflated.

01:21:54.058 --> 01:21:55.355
Oh, let it.

01:21:55.393 --> 01:21:58.021
It was just a symbol
of my conformity to the man.

01:21:58.062 --> 01:21:59.222
You are so tough.

01:21:59.263 --> 01:22:01.231
So, what do ya think?

01:22:01.265 --> 01:22:02.755
Maybe you could live down here.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.927
I don't even know why we
have this room down here...

01:22:04.969 --> 01:22:06.561
but there's food, water...

01:22:06.604 --> 01:22:10.335
first aid kit, gas mask,
Russian-language books.

01:22:10.374 --> 01:22:11.864
It's very well-insulated.

01:22:11.909 --> 01:22:13.604
It won't be where you're going.

01:22:13.644 --> 01:22:15.202
The police are on their way.

01:22:15.246 --> 01:22:17.043
Mom, please don't send my best friend
to the big house.

01:22:17.081 --> 01:22:18.378
Penny, hush.

01:22:18.416 --> 01:22:20.316
You haven't heard the last
of me, Mrs. Pingleton.

01:22:20.351 --> 01:22:21.511
Things need to change...

01:22:21.552 --> 01:22:23.577
and I won't stop tryin' to change them.

01:22:23.621 --> 01:22:25.054
I don't care how long it takes.

01:22:25.089 --> 01:22:27.057
Good, you'll be waiting 20 to life.

01:22:27.091 --> 01:22:28.217
Get the jump rope, Penny.

01:22:28.259 --> 01:22:29.556
Mom, not the jump rope!

01:22:29.593 --> 01:22:31.083
Don't you touch my canned tuna.

01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:34.754
You wait till your father
gets out of prison.

01:22:34.799 --> 01:22:37.199
You'll see more than a jump rope, missy!

01:22:37.234 --> 01:22:40.533
A massive manhunt is
underway for Miss Turnblad...

01:22:40.571 --> 01:22:43.597
who bludgeoned sergeant and
decorated Korean war veteran...

01:22:43.641 --> 01:22:46.235
Mike Morris with a crowbar,
shattering his jaw...

01:22:46.277 --> 01:22:47.904
That is a lie.

01:22:47.945 --> 01:22:50.675
They're talkin' about our baby, Wilbur.

01:22:50.714 --> 01:22:51.908
They're tellin' lies.

01:22:51.949 --> 01:22:53.246
Sergeant Morris is in critical condition.

01:22:53.284 --> 01:22:54.751
This is such a Midol moment.

01:22:55.786 --> 01:22:58.414
Wilbur, that-Oh! Maybe that's her.
Oh, that's her.

01:22:58.456 --> 01:23:00.947
Is that you, Tracy?

01:23:02.126 --> 01:23:04.424
Oh, Link. I thought you'd be Tracy.

01:23:04.462 --> 01:23:06.430
Uh, no. L-I was just at home, uh...

01:23:06.464 --> 01:23:08.227
practicing my new twist on the twist...

01:23:08.265 --> 01:23:10.290
and I overheard it on the news.

01:23:10.334 --> 01:23:13.599
I can't believe Tracy savagely bludgeoned
an Eagle Scout.

01:23:13.637 --> 01:23:15.229
That's just not like her.

01:23:15.272 --> 01:23:16.432
Well, it's not true, I was there.

01:23:16.474 --> 01:23:17.771
He didn't even bleed.

01:23:17.808 --> 01:23:19.105
I shoulda been there...

01:23:19.143 --> 01:23:20.940
beside her.

01:23:20.978 --> 01:23:23.071
I can't sleep, I can't eat.

01:23:23.114 --> 01:23:24.206
You can't eat?

01:23:24.248 --> 01:23:26.409
Well, come on in and worry with us.

01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:28.077
I'll make you some pork.

01:23:28.119 --> 01:23:31.247
Penny Lou Pingleton, you are absolutely...

01:23:31.288 --> 01:23:33.688
positively, permanently punished.

01:23:33.724 --> 01:23:37.182
You will live on a diet
of saltines and Tang...

01:23:37.228 --> 01:23:40.720
and you will never leave
this room again.

01:23:43.501 --> 01:23:45.969
Devil child! Devil child!

01:23:53.711 --> 01:23:56.236
Seaweed. Shh, don't let her hear you.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.872
Penny, what happened to you?

01:23:57.915 --> 01:23:59.678
She's punishing me
for harboring a fugitive...

01:23:59.717 --> 01:24:00.706
without her permission.

01:24:00.751 --> 01:24:02.343
What are you doing?

01:24:02.386 --> 01:24:05.184
I'm here to rescue the fair maiden, baby.

01:24:10.728 --> 01:24:12.696
Oh, Seaweed, you do care.

01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:15.790
I was afraid the colors of
our skin would keep us apart.

01:24:15.833 --> 01:24:18.165
No. These knots might.

01:24:18.202 --> 01:24:20.329
W- Was your mom in the navy?

01:24:25.176 --> 01:24:29.943
# Once I was a selfish fool
who never understood #

01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:32.141
# Never looked inside myself #

01:24:32.183 --> 01:24:35.016
# Though on the outside, I looked good #

01:24:35.052 --> 01:24:39.887
# Then we met and you made me
the man I am today #

01:24:39.924 --> 01:24:44.224
# Tracy, I'm in love with you,
no matter what you weigh #

01:24:44.261 --> 01:24:45.888
# 'Cause without love #

01:24:45.930 --> 01:24:49.229
# Life is like the seasons
with no summer #

01:24:49.266 --> 01:24:51.029
# Without love #

01:24:51.068 --> 01:24:54.196
# Life is rock 'n' roll without a drummer #

01:24:54.238 --> 01:24:56.502
# Tracy, I'll be yours forever #

01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:58.906
# 'Cause I never wanna be #

01:24:58.943 --> 01:25:02.811
# Without love #

01:25:02.846 --> 01:25:04.780
# Tracy, never set me free #

01:25:06.116 --> 01:25:08.243
# No, I ain't lyin' #

01:25:08.285 --> 01:25:09.775
# Never set me free #

01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:12.721
# Tracy, no, no, no #

01:25:14.291 --> 01:25:18.887
# Livin' in the ghetto,
black is everywhere ya go #

01:25:18.929 --> 01:25:21.329
# Who'd've thought I'd love a girl #

01:25:21.365 --> 01:25:24.232
# Whose skin was white
as winter snow? #

01:25:24.268 --> 01:25:25.929
# In my ivory tower #

01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:28.666
# Life was just a hostess snack #

01:25:28.706 --> 01:25:30.731
# But now I've tasted chocolate #

01:25:30.774 --> 01:25:33.072
# And I'm never going back #

01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:34.941
# 'Cause without love #

01:25:34.979 --> 01:25:38.415
# Life is like a beat
that you can't follow #

01:25:38.449 --> 01:25:40.110
# Without love #

01:25:40.150 --> 01:25:43.347
# Life is Doris Day at the Apollo #

01:25:43.387 --> 01:25:45.617
# Darling, I'll be yours forever #

01:25:45.656 --> 01:25:48.056
# 'Cause I never wanna be #

01:25:48.092 --> 01:25:51.459
# Without love #

01:25:51.495 --> 01:25:55.090
# So, darling, never set me free, no #

01:25:55.132 --> 01:25:59.466
# I'm yours forever,
never set me free #

01:25:59.503 --> 01:26:01.994
# No, no, no #

01:26:05.075 --> 01:26:08.044
# If I'm left without my baby doll #

01:26:08.078 --> 01:26:10.911
# I don't know what I'll do #

01:26:10.948 --> 01:26:12.575
# Link, I've got to break out #

01:26:12.616 --> 01:26:15.744
# So that I can get my hands on you #

01:26:15.786 --> 01:26:20.246
# Girl, if I can't touch you,
then I'm gonna lose control #

01:26:20.291 --> 01:26:22.851
# Seaweed, you're
my black white knight #

01:26:22.893 --> 01:26:24.884
# I've found my blue-eyed soul #

01:26:24.928 --> 01:26:27.658
# Sweet freedom is our goal #

01:26:27.698 --> 01:26:30.064
# Trace, I wanna kiss ya! #

01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:32.227
# Let me out at the next toll! #

01:26:32.269 --> 01:26:34.032
# Without love #

01:26:34.071 --> 01:26:37.006
# Life is like a prom that won't invite us #

01:26:37.041 --> 01:26:38.338
# Without love #

01:26:38.375 --> 01:26:42.175
# It's like getting my big break
and laryngitis #

01:26:42.212 --> 01:26:43.645
# Without love #

01:26:43.681 --> 01:26:46.912
# Life's a 45 when you can't buy it #

01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:48.508
# Without love #

01:26:48.552 --> 01:26:51.851
# Life is like my mother on a diet #

01:26:51.889 --> 01:26:54.221
# Like a week that's only Mondays #

01:26:54.258 --> 01:26:56.624
# Only ice cream, never sundaes #

01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:59.288
# Like a circle with no center #

01:26:59.330 --> 01:27:01.321
# Like a door marked "do not enter" #

01:27:01.365 --> 01:27:04.232
# Darling, I'll be yours forever #

01:27:04.268 --> 01:27:06.327
# 'Cause I never wanna be #

01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:10.033
# Without love #

01:27:10.074 --> 01:27:11.701
# Yes, now you've captured me #

01:27:11.742 --> 01:27:14.540
# Without love #

01:27:14.578 --> 01:27:16.842
# I surrender happily #

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:19.542
# Without love #

01:27:19.583 --> 01:27:22.051
# Oh, Seaweed, never set me free #

01:27:22.086 --> 01:27:23.246
# No, no, no #

01:27:23.287 --> 01:27:25.050
# I ain't lyin' #

01:27:25.089 --> 01:27:27.853
# Never set me free #

01:27:27.891 --> 01:27:29.722
# No, no, no #

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.421
# No, I don't wanna live without #

01:27:31.462 --> 01:27:33.828
# Love, love, love #

01:27:33.864 --> 01:27:35.559
# Pretty Penny little #

01:27:35.599 --> 01:27:38.796
# Darling, you had best believe me #

01:27:38.836 --> 01:27:42.533
# Never leave me without love #

01:27:43.607 --> 01:27:44.574
Link.

01:27:44.608 --> 01:27:46.075
Your pork is ready.

01:27:46.110 --> 01:27:47.077
Uh, Mama, I-

01:27:47.111 --> 01:27:48.442
You tryin' to hide her here?

01:27:48.479 --> 01:27:50.413
Uh.

01:27:51.715 --> 01:27:53.580
Why you ain't think-a that before?

01:27:53.617 --> 01:27:54.914
Everything she done for us.

01:27:54.952 --> 01:27:56.078
Where your manners at, boy?

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.246
Ow! Well, I don't know.

01:27:58.956 --> 01:28:00.514
And what about this one?

01:28:00.557 --> 01:28:02.923
Seaweed's got a girlfriend.

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.086
Inez, shut up.

01:28:04.128 --> 01:28:05.595
- You.
- Oh.

01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:07.927
So this is love.

01:28:07.965 --> 01:28:09.830
Well, love is a gift.

01:28:09.867 --> 01:28:11.698
Lotta people don't remember that.

01:28:11.735 --> 01:28:14.101
So you two better brace yourselves...

01:28:14.138 --> 01:28:16.163
for a whole lotta ugly comin' at you...

01:28:16.206 --> 01:28:18.299
from a never-ending parade of stupid.

01:28:18.342 --> 01:28:19.969
So you met my mom?

01:28:23.814 --> 01:28:24.872
Hello?

01:28:24.915 --> 01:28:26.644
- Mom?
- Tracy, are you OK?

01:28:26.683 --> 01:28:27.945
- Yes, I'm safe.
- Oh, my God.

01:28:27.985 --> 01:28:29.077
- Mom, listen.
- Where are you?

01:28:29.119 --> 01:28:30.313
- I need your help.
- What?

01:28:30.354 --> 01:28:32.618
Tomorrow's the Miss
Teenage Hairspray pageant.

01:28:32.656 --> 01:28:33.623
Tracy, you-

01:28:33.657 --> 01:28:34.919
I need you to come down to the station.

01:28:34.958 --> 01:28:35.925
Well-well, Tracy-

01:28:35.959 --> 01:28:37.119
- Dress nice.
- What?

01:28:37.161 --> 01:28:38.128
Penny will meet you out front.

01:28:38.162 --> 01:28:39.220
Now let me talk to Dad.

01:28:39.263 --> 01:28:41.060
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:28:41.098 --> 01:28:42.759
Turn your face this way.

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.062
The other way. Go.

01:28:44.101 --> 01:28:46.626
Everybody,
please take your seats.

01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:50.003
The Miss Teenage Hairspray
pageant is about to begin.

01:28:55.345 --> 01:28:57.813
Oh, you've come on a very exciting day.

01:28:57.848 --> 01:29:00.715
It's our first live show.

01:29:00.751 --> 01:29:02.150
<i>Oh! Bye Bye, Birdie.</i>

01:29:02.186 --> 01:29:04.416
Oh, my Amber is perfect for that.

01:29:04.455 --> 01:29:06.923
She's the pretty little blonde. Ha ha!

01:29:08.192 --> 01:29:14.290
And we're live in 5, 4, 3...

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.663
And now, broadcast live
in front of a live studio audience...

01:29:20.704 --> 01:29:22.968
for the first time from the certified...

01:29:23.006 --> 01:29:25.167
<i>up-to-code WYZT studio...</i>

01:29:25.209 --> 01:29:28.838
<i>it's the Corny Collins Miss Hairspray
spectacular.</i>

01:29:28.879 --> 01:29:30.744

Brought to you by Ultra Clutch hairspray.

01:29:34.151 --> 01:29:37.245
# What gives a girl power and punch #

01:29:37.287 --> 01:29:38.811
# Is it charm, is it poise #

01:29:38.856 --> 01:29:40.790
# No, it's hairspray #

01:29:40.824 --> 01:29:44.191
# What gets a gal asked out to lunch #

01:29:44.228 --> 01:29:48.255
# Is it brains, is it dough
No, it's hairspray #

01:29:48.298 --> 01:29:50.960
# If you take a ride with
no can at your side... #

01:29:51.001 --> 01:29:53.834
"and preserve our family
through our father. " Hmm.

01:29:53.871 --> 01:29:56.738
"Let us make our father drink
wine, and let us lie with him. "

01:29:56.773 --> 01:29:58.741
# You can take off in a rocket #

01:29:58.775 --> 01:30:01.869
# And in outer space each
hair will be in place... #

01:30:01.912 --> 01:30:03.539
Link, the agents are here. Look.

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.741
# Why take a chance when
you get up and dance? #

01:30:05.782 --> 01:30:07.477
# If you twist, I insist #

01:30:07.518 --> 01:30:10.419
# You use hairspray
and tell your mother... #

01:30:10.454 --> 01:30:12.081
Maybe they'll sign us together.

01:30:12.122 --> 01:30:13.214
# Her head she should smother #

01:30:13.257 --> 01:30:16.158
# With Ultra Clutch faithfully #

01:30:16.193 --> 01:30:17.353
Well?

01:30:17.394 --> 01:30:20.625
There's no sign of her.
We're on every door. She's not inside.

01:30:20.664 --> 01:30:22.894
Doesn't mean she won't try.

01:30:22.933 --> 01:30:25.128
velma, I seriously doubt
this girl's gonna risk...

01:30:25.168 --> 01:30:26.931
incarceration to win a pageant.

01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:28.028
# That's me! #

01:30:28.071 --> 01:30:29.902
I risked communicable diseases.

01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:32.408
She'll certainly risk jail.

01:30:32.442 --> 01:30:35.240
# Better than hairspray #

01:30:35.279 --> 01:30:38.373
# That's me #

01:30:38.415 --> 01:30:43.782
# Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh,
ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh #

01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:47.153
# Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh #

01:30:47.190 --> 01:30:50.387
# What makes a man
reach out and touch? #

01:30:50.427 --> 01:30:52.190
# Ultra Clutch #

01:30:53.964 --> 01:30:57.730
# So if you're a redhead,
a blonde, or brunette #

01:30:57.768 --> 01:30:59.065
Whoo!

01:30:59.102 --> 01:31:02.833
# Just take my advice
and you might just get #

01:31:02.873 --> 01:31:06.707
# The only thing better

01:31:06.743 --> 01:31:09.576
# That's me #

01:31:09.613 --> 01:31:10.580
Ah!

01:31:10.614 --> 01:31:11.740
# He's Corny Collins #

01:31:11.782 --> 01:31:15.377
# The only thing better
than hairspray #

01:31:15.419 --> 01:31:17.250
- # Hairspray #
- Wow!

01:31:17.287 --> 01:31:20.085
# That's me #

01:31:22.726 --> 01:31:25.286
Hey, baby, you look like
you could use a stiff one.

01:31:27.297 --> 01:31:32.098
# Whoo-ooo #

01:31:32.135 --> 01:31:34.433
And we are out.

01:31:35.639 --> 01:31:37.266
Link, you sprayed it right in my face!

01:31:37.307 --> 01:31:39.002
What'd I tell you about that?

01:31:39.042 --> 01:31:41.101
Stop! You guys.

01:31:41.144 --> 01:31:42.111
Uh, powder.

01:31:42.145 --> 01:31:43.339
And we're back.

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:44.904
5, 4.

01:31:44.948 --> 01:31:45.915
Here?

01:31:45.949 --> 01:31:47.109
3.

01:31:48.986 --> 01:31:51.352
And now for the talent
portion of our competition...

01:31:51.388 --> 01:31:52.616
our Councilettes...

01:31:52.656 --> 01:31:55.454
in their Miss Teenage Hairspray
official dance-off.

01:31:55.492 --> 01:31:56.459
Uh!

01:31:59.997 --> 01:32:04.161
First off, we have the sunny
pride of Highlandtown, Darla.

01:32:08.839 --> 01:32:11.171
Hello, Darla.

01:32:11.208 --> 01:32:12.766
Miss Teenage Hairspray.

01:32:12.809 --> 01:32:14.401
Your vote is for?

01:32:14.444 --> 01:32:16.105
This little girl could power...

01:32:16.146 --> 01:32:17.738
all of greater downtown Baltimore...

01:32:17.781 --> 01:32:20.306
with her energy-Lou Ann.

01:32:24.187 --> 01:32:25.984
Who are you voting for?
Lou Ann?

01:32:26.023 --> 01:32:27.957
very good, thank you.

01:32:30.661 --> 01:32:33.323
All right.

01:32:33.363 --> 01:32:37.026
Ladies and gentlemen,
the almost too happy Tammy.

01:32:47.544 --> 01:32:50.445
And thank you, Tammy.

01:32:57.721 --> 01:32:59.120
Confirmed sighting.

01:32:59.156 --> 01:33:00.123
What?

01:33:00.157 --> 01:33:02.022
You three: Outside, now.

01:33:02.059 --> 01:33:03.026
We can't go out th-

01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:04.027
No, no. No buts. Out, out!

01:33:04.061 --> 01:33:05.028
Out! Out, out, out, out!

01:33:05.062 --> 01:33:06.689
Whatever you say, Mrs. von Tussle.

01:33:06.730 --> 01:33:08.220
Whoo!

01:33:11.902 --> 01:33:14.462
Aw, she's too cute, isn't she?

01:33:14.504 --> 01:33:15.903
Hold it right there, Tracy.

01:33:16.907 --> 01:33:18.465
Looking for someone?

01:33:18.508 --> 01:33:20.703
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

01:33:20.744 --> 01:33:22.712
- Ha.
- A what?

01:33:22.746 --> 01:33:24.043
It was a diversion.

01:33:24.081 --> 01:33:26.049
Oh, please, these people are
not capable of a diversion.

01:33:26.083 --> 01:33:27.778
It's beyond their mental capacity.

01:33:27.818 --> 01:33:28.910
I wouldn't be so sure, velma.

01:33:28.952 --> 01:33:30.044
Oh, my God.

01:33:30.087 --> 01:33:31.213
What if she's already in the building?

01:33:31.254 --> 01:33:33.222
What if she's been here for hours...

01:33:33.256 --> 01:33:34.723
and you've locked yourselves out?

01:33:34.758 --> 01:33:35.884
What?

01:33:35.926 --> 01:33:37.553
- Check the doors!
- Let's go!

01:33:37.594 --> 01:33:39.221
It's locked!

01:33:39.262 --> 01:33:40.422
They're all locked!

01:33:40.464 --> 01:33:43.490
And now a fast girl
who loves to slow dance...

01:33:43.533 --> 01:33:46.001
our own smooth-as-silk Shelley.

01:33:47.437 --> 01:33:48.563
Ohh!

01:33:48.605 --> 01:33:50.937
Keep goin'. Keep goin'. That's it.

01:33:50.974 --> 01:33:52.100
Come on.

01:33:52.142 --> 01:33:53.234
Put your backs into it, men.

01:33:53.276 --> 01:33:54.538
Put your backs into it this time.

01:33:56.213 --> 01:33:58.579
Come on, one more time.
One more time.

01:33:58.615 --> 01:34:01.277
Come on, come on, come on.

01:34:08.258 --> 01:34:10.453
Here's our little dynamic
duo from Conkling Street.

01:34:11.995 --> 01:34:13.963
Double your fun
with Noreen and Doreen.

01:34:13.997 --> 01:34:15.123
What is with you people?

01:34:15.165 --> 01:34:16.928
I mean, how hard is it
to beat down a door?

01:34:16.967 --> 01:34:19.231
That hairspray battering ram was heavy.

01:34:19.269 --> 01:34:20.429
Heavy?

01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:23.030
How could they be heavy, they're...

01:34:23.073 --> 01:34:24.165
hollow.

01:34:26.143 --> 01:34:27.474
Move it.

01:34:27.511 --> 01:34:28.910
Let's get 'em. Let's go.

01:34:48.298 --> 01:34:49.526
And, of course...

01:34:49.566 --> 01:34:52.057
our three-time
Miss Hairspray champion...

01:34:52.102 --> 01:34:55.071
the ever-charming, Amber.

01:34:56.673 --> 01:34:57.640
Oh, my God.

01:34:57.674 --> 01:35:00.336
You carried her in!

01:35:00.377 --> 01:35:01.674
Go!

01:35:10.387 --> 01:35:12.048
Ow!

01:35:12.088 --> 01:35:13.146
It's locked.

01:35:13.190 --> 01:35:14.157
Open it!

01:35:15.525 --> 01:35:16.651
Let's give
a final round of applause...

01:35:16.693 --> 01:35:19.253
to our Miss Teenage
Hairspray contestants.

01:35:24.234 --> 01:35:25.201
Hey.

01:35:33.043 --> 01:35:34.476
All right, all right.

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:39.012
We are so close to announcing...

01:35:39.049 --> 01:35:40.516
the new Miss Teenage Hairspray.

01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:41.608
Look at that board.

01:35:41.651 --> 01:35:44.677
What a nail-biter this one is turning into.

01:35:46.022 --> 01:35:47.956
Ladies and gentlemen, the final tally.

01:35:57.968 --> 01:35:59.367
It is my...

01:35:59.402 --> 01:36:00.664
obligation...

01:36:01.771 --> 01:36:03.830
to announce that Amber von Tussle...

01:36:03.874 --> 01:36:05.865
Is about to get out-danced.

01:36:07.410 --> 01:36:09.344
Tracy Turnblad!

01:36:14.517 --> 01:36:15.779
What!?

01:36:17.087 --> 01:36:19.715
# You can't stop an avalanche #

01:36:19.756 --> 01:36:22.384
# As it races down the hill #

01:36:22.425 --> 01:36:25.258
# You can try to stop the seasons, girl #

01:36:25.295 --> 01:36:27.957
# But 'cha know you never will #

01:36:27.998 --> 01:36:30.831
# And you can try
to stop my dancin' feet #

01:36:30.867 --> 01:36:34.064
# But I just cannot stand still #

01:36:34.104 --> 01:36:36.937
# 'Cause the world keeps
spinnin' round and round #

01:36:36.973 --> 01:36:39.305
# And my heart's keepin' time
to the speed of sound #

01:36:39.342 --> 01:36:41.503
# I was lost till I heard the drums #

01:36:41.544 --> 01:36:43.910
- # Then I found my way #
- No.

01:36:43.947 --> 01:36:45.744
- # 'Cause you can't stop the beat #
- Link!

01:36:45.782 --> 01:36:47.807
# Ever since this old world began #

01:36:47.851 --> 01:36:49.409
# A woman found out if she shook it #

01:36:49.452 --> 01:36:50.749
# She could shake up a man #

01:36:50.787 --> 01:36:51.754
# And so I'm gonna
shake and shimmy it #

01:36:51.788 --> 01:36:53.085
This throne is mine!

01:36:53.123 --> 01:36:54.920
# The best that I can today #

01:36:54.958 --> 01:36:56.755
# 'Cause you can't stop #

01:36:56.793 --> 01:36:57.987
Aah! Let me down!

01:36:58.028 --> 01:36:59.290
# The motion of the ocean
or the sun in the sky #

01:36:59.329 --> 01:37:01.923
# You can wonder if you wanna
but I never ask why #

01:37:01.965 --> 01:37:03.592
# And if you try to hold me down #

01:37:03.633 --> 01:37:04.827
# I'm gonna spit in your eye #

01:37:04.868 --> 01:37:06.495
# And say #

01:37:06.536 --> 01:37:09.630
# That you can't stop the beat #

01:37:13.209 --> 01:37:14.574
They love you, Link.

01:37:18.682 --> 01:37:19.671
Yeah?

01:37:19.716 --> 01:37:20.808
Not for long.

01:37:22.185 --> 01:37:24.346
Inez, come on!

01:37:26.022 --> 01:37:27.284
Let's dance.

01:37:31.661 --> 01:37:33.822
Little Miss Inez Stubbs!

01:37:33.863 --> 01:37:35.160
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:37:35.198 --> 01:37:36.495
Look at my baby go.

01:37:44.708 --> 01:37:45.970
- Inez.
- Inez?

01:37:52.048 --> 01:37:53.640
- Mm.
- Come on.

01:37:59.556 --> 01:38:01.023
Oh! There you go!

01:38:01.057 --> 01:38:02.024
Give her a hand, folks!

01:38:02.058 --> 01:38:03.958
Little Miss Inez Stubbs!

01:38:03.994 --> 01:38:06.053
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:38:10.233 --> 01:38:15.865
# You can't stop a river
as it rushes to the sea #

01:38:15.905 --> 01:38:18.703
# You can try to stop
the hands of time #

01:38:18.742 --> 01:38:21.404
# But 'cha know it just can't be #

01:38:21.444 --> 01:38:24.277
# And if they try to stop us, Seaweed #

01:38:24.314 --> 01:38:27.147
# We'll call the N-double-A-C-P #

01:38:27.183 --> 01:38:30.050
# 'Cause the world keeps
spinnin' round and round #

01:38:30.086 --> 01:38:32.816
# And my heart's keepin' time
to the speed of sound #

01:38:32.856 --> 01:38:35.017
# I was lost till I heard the drums #

01:38:35.058 --> 01:38:37.458
# Then I found my way #

01:38:37.494 --> 01:38:38.984
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

01:38:39.029 --> 01:38:41.293
# Ever since we first saw the light #

01:38:41.331 --> 01:38:42.923
# A man and woman liked to shake it #

01:38:42.966 --> 01:38:44.331
# On a Saturday night #

01:38:44.367 --> 01:38:45.959
# And so I'm gonna
shake and shimmy it #

01:38:46.002 --> 01:38:47.196
- # With all of my might #
- Mother!

01:38:47.237 --> 01:38:48.829
# Today #

01:38:48.872 --> 01:38:51.340
# 'Cause you can't stop
the motion of the ocean #

01:38:51.374 --> 01:38:52.671
# Or the rain from above #

01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:54.074
# They can try to stop the paradise #

01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:55.338
Hello?! Hello?!

01:38:55.378 --> 01:38:56.709
# We're dreamin' of
but you cannot stop #

01:38:56.746 --> 01:38:58.145
# The rhythm of two hearts in love #

01:38:58.181 --> 01:38:59.876
# To stay #

01:38:59.916 --> 01:39:01.281
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

01:39:01.317 --> 01:39:03.251
Aah! Aah!

01:39:03.286 --> 01:39:04.878
Ahh!

01:39:04.921 --> 01:39:05.979
Amen.

01:39:06.022 --> 01:39:08.650
I am now a checkerboard chick.

01:39:09.759 --> 01:39:10.953
Penny!

01:39:10.994 --> 01:39:12.256
No!

01:39:15.732 --> 01:39:16.824
Aah!

01:39:17.834 --> 01:39:18.823
Mommy.

01:39:22.505 --> 01:39:23.733
Ow.

01:39:28.478 --> 01:39:31.140
Live television: There's nothin' like it.

01:39:31.181 --> 01:39:32.773
Penny!

01:39:39.823 --> 01:39:42.314
And now, it's the moment
you've all been craving for.

01:39:42.358 --> 01:39:44.155
We have to wait till
they go to commercial.

01:39:44.194 --> 01:39:46.253
As you know, we've kept the lines open up
to the last minute.

01:39:46.296 --> 01:39:48.594
And those lines have been
burnin' up our switchboard.

01:39:48.631 --> 01:39:49.962
Never in the history of this pageant...

01:39:49.999 --> 01:39:52.593
has there been such a surge of late voting.

01:39:54.170 --> 01:39:55.637
Baltimore, you've picked a winner.

01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:00.799
And the new Miss Hairspray is...

01:40:00.844 --> 01:40:02.402
- Inez Stubbs!
- What?!

01:40:02.445 --> 01:40:05.243
Inez, you done it! You did it!

01:40:05.281 --> 01:40:06.942
How about that?

01:40:06.983 --> 01:40:08.280
Yes!

01:40:08.318 --> 01:40:09.751
Come on over here, Little Inez.

01:40:09.786 --> 01:40:11.549
Go, babe!

01:40:11.588 --> 01:40:12.816
Oh! Inez!

01:40:12.856 --> 01:40:13.845
Oh, my God!

01:40:13.890 --> 01:40:16.290
Ohh!

01:40:16.326 --> 01:40:17.657
That's my baby!

01:40:17.694 --> 01:40:19.127
That's my baby girl!

01:40:24.634 --> 01:40:26.659
But... She's...

01:40:26.703 --> 01:40:28.193
she's not even a candidate.

01:40:28.238 --> 01:40:30.832
She just got a tidal wave
of calls, velma.

01:40:30.874 --> 01:40:32.842
But this is invalid.
This is impossible.

01:40:32.876 --> 01:40:34.673
Well, anyone who dances
for it is eligible.

01:40:34.711 --> 01:40:37.771
Rule 30, paragraph 5, asterisk,
down at the bottom. OK.

01:40:37.814 --> 01:40:41.147
<i>Well, this also makes you the lead dancer
on The Corny Collins Show.</i>

01:40:43.186 --> 01:40:44.813
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
The Corny Collins Show...</i>

01:40:44.854 --> 01:40:47.322
is now and forever officially integrated!

01:40:51.461 --> 01:40:53.156
Oh, oh! Oh!

01:40:56.866 --> 01:40:58.697
All right. Yeah.

01:41:01.371 --> 01:41:06.707
<i>Interracial dancing has broken out
at the WYZT stage.</i>

01:41:06.743 --> 01:41:09.371
Just look at the crowd's reaction.

01:41:09.412 --> 01:41:11.141
Back to you, Steve.

01:41:11.181 --> 01:41:12.443
# I was lost till I heard the drums #

01:41:12.482 --> 01:41:14.746
# Then I found my way #

01:41:14.784 --> 01:41:17.378
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

01:41:18.388 --> 01:41:20.413
Amber, stop it!

01:41:23.126 --> 01:41:25.356
I lost, Mom.
Let's just deal with it.

01:41:25.395 --> 01:41:26.521
No, you did not lose.

01:41:26.563 --> 01:41:28.554
You cannot have lost...

01:41:28.598 --> 01:41:30.725
because I switched the damn tallies.

01:41:30.767 --> 01:41:32.166
Smile, Miss Crabmeat.

01:41:32.202 --> 01:41:34.432
<i>You're on Candid Camera.</i>

01:41:36.239 --> 01:41:38.207
That was a good shot, don't you think?

01:41:38.241 --> 01:41:39.265
Not bad.

01:41:41.044 --> 01:41:43.774
Ha ha ha! What are you doing?

01:41:43.813 --> 01:41:46.077
Get that away from me!

01:41:46.115 --> 01:41:47.742
Go to commercial!

01:41:47.784 --> 01:41:49.547
Go!

01:41:49.586 --> 01:41:50.644
velma!

01:41:58.494 --> 01:42:00.086
Pack your desk.

01:42:00.129 --> 01:42:01.892
You've tainted the name of Ultra Clutch.

01:42:01.931 --> 01:42:03.421
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:42:03.466 --> 01:42:06.594
How can you taint a cancerous
can-a chemicals?

01:42:06.636 --> 01:42:08.035
You're fired!

01:42:08.071 --> 01:42:10.232
I ca-I can't be fired.

01:42:10.273 --> 01:42:11.467
Oh, yeah?

01:42:14.110 --> 01:42:16.237
Last chance
to join the dance, folks.

01:42:16.279 --> 01:42:17.769
Everyone is welcome!

01:42:17.814 --> 01:42:19.611
Wilbur.

01:42:19.649 --> 01:42:23.107
Do it now, or forever wish you had.

01:42:23.152 --> 01:42:24.278
Really?

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:25.810
Show 'em, baby.

01:42:29.158 --> 01:42:31.126
Nobody can dance like you.

01:42:38.968 --> 01:42:41.300
# You can't stop my happiness #

01:42:41.337 --> 01:42:43.931
# 'Cause I like the way I am #

01:42:43.973 --> 01:42:46.806
# And ya just can't stop
my knife and fork #

01:42:46.843 --> 01:42:49.812
# When I see a Christmas ham #

01:42:49.846 --> 01:42:52.644
# So if you don't like the way I look #

01:42:52.682 --> 01:42:55.583
# Well, I just don't give a damn #

01:42:55.618 --> 01:42:58.178
# 'Cause the world keeps spinnin'
round and round #

01:42:58.221 --> 01:43:01.122
# And my heart's keepin' time
to the speed of sound #

01:43:01.157 --> 01:43:03.091
# I was lost till I heard the drums #

01:43:03.126 --> 01:43:05.788

01:43:39.595 --> 01:43:40.857
Whoa!

01:44:00.249 --> 01:44:01.580
Oh! I love you!

01:44:04.654 --> 01:44:05.416
You did great!

01:44:07.423 --> 01:44:09.391
Corny, do something.

01:44:09.425 --> 01:44:11.518
The show is turning to gumbo.

01:44:11.561 --> 01:44:13.256
Not a chance, velma.

01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:15.920
This is the future.

01:44:17.867 --> 01:44:20.062
Maybelle, let's go.

01:44:20.103 --> 01:44:21.866
This is your time.

01:44:27.276 --> 01:44:28.607
Yeah.

01:44:28.644 --> 01:44:29.941
All right, Miss buttercup.

01:44:29.979 --> 01:44:32.004
It's time to wrap this mutha up.

01:44:32.048 --> 01:44:33.345
# Oh, oh, oh #

01:44:33.383 --> 01:44:34.941
- # You can't stop today #
- No!

01:44:34.984 --> 01:44:38.181
# As it comes speedin' down the tracks #

01:44:38.221 --> 01:44:39.245
# Ooh, child, yes #

01:44:39.288 --> 01:44:40.880
# Child, yesterday is history #

01:44:40.923 --> 01:44:41.947
Be gone!

01:44:41.991 --> 01:44:43.618
# And it's never comin' back #

01:44:43.659 --> 01:44:44.751
# Look ahead! #

01:44:44.794 --> 01:44:46.989
# 'Cause tomorrow is a brand-new day #

01:44:47.029 --> 01:44:49.224
# And it don't know white from black #

01:44:49.265 --> 01:44:50.755
Yeah!

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:52.768
# 'Cause the world keeps
spinnin' round and round #

01:44:52.802 --> 01:44:55.566
# And my heart's keepin'
time to the speed of sound #

01:44:55.605 --> 01:44:57.732
# I was lost till I heard the drums #

01:44:57.774 --> 01:45:00.004
# Then I found my way #

01:45:00.042 --> 01:45:01.805
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

01:45:01.844 --> 01:45:03.812
# Ever since we first saw the light #

01:45:03.846 --> 01:45:05.541
# A man and woman
liked to shake it #

01:45:05.581 --> 01:45:06.946
# On a Saturday night #

01:45:06.983 --> 01:45:08.575
# And so I'm gonna
shake and shimmy it #

01:45:08.618 --> 01:45:09.676
# With all of my might #

01:45:09.719 --> 01:45:11.584
# Today #

01:45:11.621 --> 01:45:14.055
# 'Cause you can't stop
the motion of the ocean #

01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:15.455
# Or the rain from above #

01:45:15.491 --> 01:45:17.186
# They can try to stop the paradise #

01:45:17.226 --> 01:45:18.215
# We're dreamin' of #

01:45:18.261 --> 01:45:19.319
# But you cannot stop #

01:45:19.362 --> 01:45:21.125
# The rhythm of two hearts in love #

01:45:21.164 --> 01:45:22.631
# To stay #

01:45:22.665 --> 01:45:25.133
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

01:45:25.168 --> 01:45:32.572
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa #

01:45:32.608 --> 01:45:35.304
# Ever since we first saw the sun #

01:45:35.344 --> 01:45:38.142
# A man and woman liked to shake it
when the day is done #

01:45:38.181 --> 01:45:39.739
# And so we're gonna shake
and shimmy it #

01:45:39.782 --> 01:45:42.546
# And have some fun today #

01:45:42.585 --> 01:45:44.018
# 'Cause you can't stop #

01:45:44.053 --> 01:45:46.487
# The motion of the ocean
or the rain from above #

01:45:46.522 --> 01:45:49.116
# They can try to stop the
paradise we're dreamin' of #

01:45:49.158 --> 01:45:50.682
# But you'll never stop the rhythm #

01:45:50.726 --> 01:45:53.490
# Of two hearts in love to stay #

01:45:53.529 --> 01:45:55.429
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

01:45:55.465 --> 01:46:06.700
# You can't stop the beat #

01:46:25.094 --> 01:46:27.562
# Ooh, ooh #

01:46:31.067 --> 01:46:33.297
# Hey, old friend, let's look back #

01:46:33.336 --> 01:46:36.703
# On the crazy clothes we wore #

01:46:36.739 --> 01:46:39.367
# Ain't it fun to look back #

01:46:39.408 --> 01:46:42.866
# To see it's all been done before #

01:46:42.912 --> 01:46:45.380
# All those nights together #

01:46:45.414 --> 01:46:48.042
# Are a special memory #

01:46:48.084 --> 01:46:50.951
# And I can't wait for tomorrow #

01:46:50.987 --> 01:46:54.047
# Just as long as you're
dancin' next to me #

01:46:54.090 --> 01:46:56.888
# 'Cause it's so clear, every year #

01:46:56.926 --> 01:46:58.484
# We get stronger #

01:46:58.528 --> 01:46:59.961
# Stronger #

01:46:59.996 --> 01:47:02.897
# 'Cause what's gone is gone,
the past is the past #

01:47:02.932 --> 01:47:04.229
# Turn the radio up #

01:47:04.267 --> 01:47:05.564
# And then hit the gas #

01:47:05.601 --> 01:47:08.502
# 'Cause I know we've come so far #

01:47:08.538 --> 01:47:11.905
# But we've got so far to go #

01:47:11.941 --> 01:47:14.409
# I know the road seems long #

01:47:14.443 --> 01:47:17.139
# But it won't be long
till it's time to go #

01:47:17.179 --> 01:47:20.046
# So, most days, we'll take it fast #

01:47:20.082 --> 01:47:23.745
# And some nights, we'll take it slow #

01:47:23.786 --> 01:47:25.913
# I know we've come so far #

01:47:25.955 --> 01:47:31.587
# But, baby, baby,
we've got so far to go #

01:47:31.627 --> 01:47:33.754
# Oh, yeah #

01:47:33.796 --> 01:47:35.161
# Baby #

01:47:35.197 --> 01:47:37.097
# Hey, old friend, together #

01:47:37.133 --> 01:47:40.762
# Side by side and year by year #

01:47:40.803 --> 01:47:43.271
# The road was filled
with twists and turns #

01:47:43.306 --> 01:47:46.434
# Oh, but that's the road
that got us here #

01:47:46.475 --> 01:47:49.205
# Let's move past the bad times #

01:47:49.245 --> 01:47:52.612
# But before those memories fade #

01:47:52.648 --> 01:47:55.048
# Let's forgive but not forget #

01:47:55.084 --> 01:47:57.917
# And learn from all
the mistakes we made #

01:47:57.954 --> 01:48:00.616
# 'Cause it's so clear, every year #

01:48:00.656 --> 01:48:02.521
# We get stronger #

01:48:02.558 --> 01:48:03.786
# Stronger #

01:48:03.826 --> 01:48:06.624
# So don't give up and don't say when #

01:48:06.662 --> 01:48:09.256
# And just get back
on the road again #

01:48:09.298 --> 01:48:12.165
# 'Cause I know we've come so far #

01:48:12.201 --> 01:48:15.967
# But we've got so far to go #

01:48:16.005 --> 01:48:18.030
# I know the road seems long #

01:48:18.074 --> 01:48:20.872
# But it won't be long
till it's time to go #

01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:23.970
# So, most days, we'll take it fast #

01:48:24.013 --> 01:48:27.574
# And some nights, we'll take it slow #

01:48:27.617 --> 01:48:29.608
# I know we've come so far #

01:48:29.652 --> 01:48:34.885
# But, baby, baby,
we've got so far to go #

01:48:34.924 --> 01:48:35.982
# Oh, yeah #

01:48:36.025 --> 01:48:37.356
# Baby #

01:48:37.393 --> 01:48:38.826
# Uh, uh, uh, uh #

01:48:38.861 --> 01:48:41.591
# Hey, old friend, come
along for the ride #

01:48:41.631 --> 01:48:44.259
# There's plenty of room so jump inside #

01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:47.167
# The highway's bumpy
every now and then #

01:48:47.203 --> 01:48:50.172
# But it's so much better
than where I've been #

01:48:50.206 --> 01:48:53.107
# Just keep moving at your own speed #

01:48:53.142 --> 01:48:55.667
# Your heart is all the compass
you'll ever need #

01:48:55.711 --> 01:48:58.874
# Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on #

01:48:58.914 --> 01:49:01.246
# 'Cause the rearview mirror
only shows what's #

01:49:01.283 --> 01:49:03.683
# Gone, gone, gone #

01:49:03.719 --> 01:49:06.620
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

01:49:06.656 --> 01:49:09.386
# Got so far to go #

01:49:09.425 --> 01:49:10.483
# Ohh #
# Yeah #

01:49:10.526 --> 01:49:13.689
# Ohh #

01:49:13.729 --> 01:49:16.391
# 'Cause it's so clear, every year #

01:49:16.432 --> 01:49:18.024
# We get stronger #

01:49:18.067 --> 01:49:19.364
# Stronger #

01:49:19.402 --> 01:49:21.165
# So shine that light #

01:49:21.203 --> 01:49:22.534
# Take my hand #

01:49:22.571 --> 01:49:24.903
# And let's dance
into the promised land #

01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:27.807
# 'Cause I know we've come so far #

01:49:27.843 --> 01:49:31.472
# But we've got so far to go #

01:49:31.514 --> 01:49:33.539
# I know the road seems long #

01:49:33.582 --> 01:49:36.449
# But it won't be long
till it's time to go #

01:49:36.485 --> 01:49:39.386

# I know we've come so far #

01:49:45.294 --> 01:49:50.357
# But, baby, baby,
we've got so far to go #

01:49:50.399 --> 01:49:52.390
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

01:49:52.435 --> 01:49:54.062
# Yeah, yeah #

01:49:54.103 --> 01:49:55.900
# Welcome to the sixties #

01:49:55.938 --> 01:49:56.905
Stop!

01:49:56.939 --> 01:50:00.431
# Stop telling me what to do #

01:50:00.476 --> 01:50:01.738
Don't!

01:50:01.777 --> 01:50:05.042
# Don't treat me like a child of two #

01:50:05.081 --> 01:50:06.275
No!

01:50:06.315 --> 01:50:09.910
# I know that you want what's best #

01:50:09.952 --> 01:50:10.919
Please!

01:50:10.953 --> 01:50:12.750
# But, Mother, please #

01:50:12.788 --> 01:50:18.749
# Give it a rest! #

01:50:18.794 --> 01:50:28.560
# Stop! Don't! No! Please! #

01:50:28.604 --> 01:50:31.937
# Mama, I'm a big girl now #

01:50:31.974 --> 01:50:35.307
# Once upon a time
when I was just a kid #

01:50:35.344 --> 01:50:38.609
# You never let me do
just what the older kids did #

01:50:38.647 --> 01:50:42.048
# But lose that laundry list
of what you won't allow #

01:50:42.084 --> 01:50:45.611
# 'Cause, Mama,
I'm a big girl now #

01:50:45.654 --> 01:50:49.112
# Once upon a time
I played with childhood toys #

01:50:49.158 --> 01:50:52.321
# But now I'd rather play around
with older boys #

01:50:52.361 --> 01:50:55.762
# So, if I get a hickey,
please don't have a cow #

01:50:55.798 --> 01:50:57.823
# 'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now #

01:50:59.168 --> 01:51:02.103
# Ma, I gotta tell you
that without a doubt #

01:51:02.138 --> 01:51:05.801
# I get my best dancing lessons
from you #

01:51:05.841 --> 01:51:08.901
# You're the one who taught me
how to twist and shout #

01:51:08.944 --> 01:51:13.142
# Because you shout non-stop
and you're so twisted, too! #

01:51:13.182 --> 01:51:14.877
# Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh #

01:51:14.917 --> 01:51:17.715
# Once I used to fidget
'cause I just sat home #

01:51:17.753 --> 01:51:21.211
# But now I'm just like Gidget
and I gotta get to Rome! #

01:51:21.257 --> 01:51:22.485
<i># So say, arrivederci! #</i>

01:51:22.525 --> 01:51:23.492
# Toodle-loo! #

01:51:23.526 --> 01:51:24.925
<i># And ciao! #</i>

01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:27.827
# 'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now #

01:51:27.863 --> 01:51:31.856
# Ohh, stop! Don't! No! Please! #

01:51:31.901 --> 01:51:38.237
# Stop! Don't! No! Please! #

01:51:38.274 --> 01:51:40.435
# Mama, I'm a big girl now #

01:51:40.476 --> 01:51:42.034
# Hey, Mama, say, Mama #

01:51:42.077 --> 01:51:45.046
# Once upon a time
I was a shy young thing #

01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:48.413
# Could barely walk and talk
so much as dance and sing #

01:51:48.450 --> 01:51:51.851
# But let me hit that stage,
I wanna take my bow #

01:51:51.887 --> 01:51:54.185
# 'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now #

01:51:54.223 --> 01:51:55.690
# Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh #

01:51:55.724 --> 01:51:58.750
# Once upon a time
I used to dress up Ken #

01:51:58.794 --> 01:52:02.025
# But now that I'm a woman,
I like bigger men #

01:52:02.064 --> 01:52:05.522
# And I don't need a Barbie doll
to show me how #

01:52:05.568 --> 01:52:07.798
# 'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now #

01:52:07.837 --> 01:52:09.327
# Ooh, ooh, ah #

01:52:09.371 --> 01:52:12.135
# Ma, you always taught me
what was right from wrong #

01:52:12.174 --> 01:52:15.871
# And now I just wanna give it a try #

01:52:15.911 --> 01:52:18.937
# Mama, I've been in the nest
for far too long #

01:52:18.981 --> 01:52:23.042
# So please give a push
and, Mama, watch me fly #

01:52:23.085 --> 01:52:25.451
# Watch me fly #

01:52:25.487 --> 01:52:26.579
Show off.

01:52:26.622 --> 01:52:29.716
# Someday I will meet
a man you won't condemn #

01:52:29.758 --> 01:52:32.852
# And we will have some kids
and you can torture them #

01:52:32.895 --> 01:52:36.092
# But let me be a star
before I take that vow #

01:52:36.131 --> 01:52:38.326
# 'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now #

01:52:38.367 --> 01:52:39.800
# Whoa-oh-oh #

01:52:39.835 --> 01:52:41.700
# Mama, I'm a big girl now #

01:52:41.737 --> 01:52:43.068
# Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! #

01:52:43.105 --> 01:52:46.472
# Mama, I'm a big girl #

01:52:46.508 --> 01:52:48.772
Ooh, such a big, big girl!

01:52:48.811 --> 01:52:52.178
# I'm a big girl now #

01:52:52.214 --> 01:52:59.418
# Whoa-oh-oh, whoaaaa! #

01:52:59.455 --> 01:53:02.447
# Please, Mama, I'm a big girl now #

01:53:04.793 --> 01:53:07.921
# They came from way
far out in outer space #

01:53:07.963 --> 01:53:11.558
# She's hard to miss
and so they landed on her face #

01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:13.659
# She's got cooties! #

01:53:13.702 --> 01:53:15.169
# They've found a place to nest #

01:53:15.204 --> 01:53:16.262
# She's got cooties #

01:53:16.305 --> 01:53:17.431
# Cooties #

01:53:17.473 --> 01:53:19.065
# If I were her, I'd be depressed #

01:53:19.108 --> 01:53:21.042
# Long tailed, sharp nailed #

01:53:21.076 --> 01:53:23.101
# Fuzzy legs, laying eggs #
