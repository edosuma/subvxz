00:01.170 --> 00:03.299
On this episode of "MythBusters"...

00:03.300 --> 00:04.530
Usually, you fill potholes.

00:04.531 --> 00:07.010
I'm digging them, what are you gonna do?

00:07.440 --> 00:10.610
...Adam and Jamie get
punctures on purpose...

00:10.660 --> 00:12.889
I have always wanted to do that!

00:12.890 --> 00:16.390
...as they test mythical
ways of fixing a flat...

00:16.420 --> 00:18.509
I thought with a flat in the wild,

00:18.510 --> 00:20.149
we'd be grasping at straws.

00:20.150 --> 00:24.550
...from mother nature, to the urban sprawl.

00:25.390 --> 00:25.980
Yeah baby.

00:26.950 --> 00:30.109
Can you really improvise
your way out of a jam?

00:30.110 --> 00:33.160
Test time. Manhole cover wheel. Go.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.080
Meanwhile,

00:35.081 --> 00:37.439
Kari, Grant and Tory

00:37.440 --> 00:39.010
reel in a fishy fable,

00:40.910 --> 00:43.780
as they test this viral video.

00:44.650 --> 00:48.440
If you catch a fast enough fish,

00:49.680 --> 00:52.789
can it ever set your reel aflame?

00:52.790 --> 00:55.179
It's getting too hot to hold!

00:55.180 --> 00:56.640
312.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.170
Who are the MythBusters?

01:01.620 --> 01:02.799
Adam Savage...

01:02.800 --> 01:04.560
Three, two, one.

01:05.470 --> 01:08.109
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.430
We are just gonna have
to crash it to find out.

01:09.431 --> 01:13.769
Between them, more than 30 years
of special effects experience.

01:13.770 --> 01:14.510
Joining them,

01:15.660 --> 01:16.779
Tory Belleci...

01:16.780 --> 01:17.940
Time to go diving.

01:18.330 --> 01:20.259
...Grant Imahara...

01:20.260 --> 01:21.230
44 Magnum, baby.

01:21.231 --> 01:22.700
...and Kari Byron.

01:23.540 --> 01:25.860
They don't just tell the myths,

01:26.360 --> 01:29.190
they put them to the test.

01:29.215 --> 01:33.215
MythBusters 9x09 - Fixing A Flat

01:38.820 --> 01:40.890
All right, Jamie, I'm gonna
paint you a picture.

01:41.010 --> 01:42.918
You've driven out to the middle of nowhere

01:42.919 --> 01:43.788
to go backwoods camping.

01:43.789 --> 01:45.100
You've hiked out into the wilderness,

01:45.101 --> 01:47.789
and at the end of the weekend
you hike back to your car

01:47.890 --> 01:49.790
to find... oh! you got a flat tyre.

01:49.990 --> 01:51.940
- What do you do?
- I put on the spare.

01:51.941 --> 01:53.280
You don't have a spare.

01:53.340 --> 01:54.430
I call a tow truck.

01:54.540 --> 01:57.469
- No, no cell phone reception.
- I walk out.

01:57.470 --> 01:59.359
No, walking is not an option.

01:59.360 --> 02:01.610
You have to somehow

02:01.640 --> 02:06.180
make that flat tire into a workable wheel.
What do you do?

02:06.360 --> 02:07.989
I improvise.

02:07.990 --> 02:09.810
Exactly. That's what this story's about.

02:09.811 --> 02:12.719
Improvised solutions to making a flat tyre

02:12.720 --> 02:14.910
into a workable wheel in the wilderness.

02:16.740 --> 02:20.550
Under normal circumstances,
fixing a flat is simple.

02:20.860 --> 02:23.230
Unpack the jack, prepare the spare

02:23.240 --> 02:24.820
and you're good to go.

02:27.400 --> 02:31.179
But if you're in the middle of
nowhere and the spare's not there,

02:31.180 --> 02:33.020
can you improvise your way out?

02:33.340 --> 02:36.580
Can mother nature really
come to the rescue?

02:36.970 --> 02:39.780
Or will this myth hit the hay?

02:41.010 --> 02:42.060
So what's the plan?

02:42.061 --> 02:44.619
Well, we got a whole bunch of
suggestions from the fan site

02:44.620 --> 02:47.030
for things people claim to have
tried that got them out of jams.

02:47.031 --> 02:49.800
I think we should choose
the three best to test.

02:49.840 --> 02:53.129
What say we go to the great
outdoors and set up a course then?

02:53.130 --> 02:55.729
A course that would include
all the different obstacles

02:55.730 --> 02:58.419
one might encounter trying to
get themselves out of a jam.

02:58.420 --> 02:59.420
Exactly.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.119
So to put this tyre trilogy to the test,

03:04.120 --> 03:06.400
the team heads for the hills.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.678
In order to run our tyre
fixes through their paces,

03:10.679 --> 03:12.600
we've chosen a course in
this off-road facility

03:12.601 --> 03:16.239
that will give us the widest range
of standard road hazards

03:16.240 --> 03:19.210
you might encounter in
just this kind of setting.

03:19.530 --> 03:21.360
And that setting isn't the only thing

03:21.361 --> 03:23.190
they've settled on.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.049
This is our test car.

03:25.050 --> 03:27.279
It is an average, ordinary,
everyday standard

03:27.280 --> 03:28.458
and that's the point.

03:28.459 --> 03:30.408
This story is about an ordinary car

03:30.409 --> 03:31.660
out for an ordinary drive

03:31.661 --> 03:33.119
when things go sour

03:33.120 --> 03:36.290
and an extraordinary solution is required.

03:37.130 --> 03:40.250
With the car sorted and
a two-mile lap lined up,

03:40.290 --> 03:41.900
things are looking good.

03:43.020 --> 03:46.460
So all they need now is
to acquire a flat tire.

03:48.990 --> 03:51.590
I have always wanted to do that.

03:52.930 --> 03:55.120
What are we going to do?
We've got a flat tire!

03:55.330 --> 03:56.040
So, here is the drill.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.349
You're out in nature

03:57.350 --> 03:59.130
miles from the road with a flat tire

03:59.190 --> 04:02.480
and no spare.
Pop quiz, hot shot, what do you do?

04:02.540 --> 04:05.929
What you do is improvise.
And so that's what we're gonna do.

04:05.930 --> 04:09.109
We're going to make our
equivalent of a run flat tire

04:09.110 --> 04:14.040
out of stuff at hand,
like vegetation or straw.

04:14.940 --> 04:16.190
Yep, you heard right.

04:16.190 --> 04:20.529
Fan fix number one involves
first removing the wheel...

04:21.000 --> 04:23.680
I just happen to have a lovely garage jack.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.030
...then stuffing the
cut-open tire with straw...

04:27.530 --> 04:28.960
That's what I'm thinking.

04:28.961 --> 04:31.089
Well, let's just see
how far we get with that.

04:31.090 --> 04:34.429
...before delivering
a collection of bad puns.

04:34.430 --> 04:36.360
I thought with a flat in the wild

04:36.470 --> 04:37.960
we'd be grasping at straws,

04:37.961 --> 04:39.540
but this is giving me high hopes.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.910
Well, hey, if it works.

04:41.940 --> 04:44.289
With Mark Twain turning in his grave,

04:44.290 --> 04:46.430
the guys reattach the wheel...

04:47.090 --> 04:48.160
Hey, that's not bad.

04:48.161 --> 04:51.239
...before stuffing in more
straw, until the tire

04:51.240 --> 04:53.310
is literally fit to burst.

04:53.390 --> 04:55.110
Well, that's the last straw.

04:55.370 --> 04:58.130
Now it's time for our
straw-filled tire test.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.810
How do I think it's going to go?

04:59.910 --> 05:04.539
Well, I'm positive that having straw
in this tire is going to be better

05:04.540 --> 05:07.840
than if we just had a normal flat tire.

05:07.980 --> 05:09.370
How long it actually lasts

05:09.371 --> 05:11.769
and whether the straw stays in there

05:11.770 --> 05:13.509
is the only worry that I have.

05:13.510 --> 05:16.590
And the only way to find
that out is to test it.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.790
Sensibly, Jamie starts slow.

05:20.990 --> 05:22.370
How does it feel?

05:22.760 --> 05:25.060
It feels a little spongy,

05:25.380 --> 05:27.289
but... seems like it's working.

05:27.290 --> 05:29.730
But once they survive the speed bump...

05:29.740 --> 05:31.450
You bottomed out there.

05:31.550 --> 05:34.700
...and the pothole...

05:34.730 --> 05:37.419
- Fine two.
- Totally flown.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.649
...he's confident enough to speed up.

05:39.650 --> 05:41.229
Through the pothole!

05:41.230 --> 05:43.660
And by the time he's half way around,

05:43.670 --> 05:47.430
you might say he's making
hay while the sun shines.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.270
Definitely a very reasonable
escape plan so far.

05:51.290 --> 05:52.470
Let's go uphill.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.819
Amazingly, the straw tire stands up

05:54.820 --> 05:57.650
to whatever stands in its way...

05:58.050 --> 06:00.060
- No problem.
- We can make it home.

06:00.290 --> 06:03.510
...at least until Jamie tries
to end with a bang.

06:06.010 --> 06:08.270
Very, very well done.

06:12.140 --> 06:14.170
It looks a little different.

06:15.550 --> 06:19.489
I had high hopes for the day and
my hopes were not misplaced.

06:19.490 --> 06:21.949
It performed fantastically.

06:21.950 --> 06:24.549
It went through the obstacle course
pretty much without a hitch.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.700
You could feel it deteriorating.

06:26.890 --> 06:30.150
My feeling is, you're using this
to get out of a jam, okay?

06:30.160 --> 06:31.679
In this case would absolutely

06:31.680 --> 06:34.480
get you out of this jam.

06:36.770 --> 06:39.070
Very nicely done.

06:39.330 --> 06:42.500
Well, as a fix, I'm calling hay plausible.

06:42.580 --> 06:44.789
Yeah. Only a short-term one, though.

06:44.790 --> 06:46.979
Agreed. What's next?

06:46.980 --> 06:49.159
Well, I think nature may have

06:49.160 --> 06:51.750
some more surprises in store for us.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.080
Next up, something fishy.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.769
All right, so this next myth
is an old fishing myth.

07:03.770 --> 07:05.670
And it's not about the
big one that got away,

07:05.671 --> 07:07.509
this one is about flaming reels.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.778
Okay, flaming reels,

07:08.779 --> 07:09.630
you're gonna have to
give me more than that.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.290
All right, you know,
as every fisherman knows,

07:11.291 --> 07:12.909
once the fish is on the line,

07:12.910 --> 07:14.679
all it wants to do is get away.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.080
You're meaning it takes off
in the opposite direction.

07:17.130 --> 07:20.779
Exactly. As it's taking off, it's
pulling a lot of line off that reel.

07:20.780 --> 07:21.978
Okay, I see where you're going with this.

07:21.979 --> 07:23.968
If the line's coming off fast
enough, it generates friction

07:23.969 --> 07:24.938
which creates heat.

07:24.939 --> 07:26.340
And if it generated enough heat,

07:26.341 --> 07:29.560
it could burst into flame,
hence the name flaming reel.

07:29.570 --> 07:30.880
And that's the myth.

07:30.890 --> 07:33.070
Can a fish cause a reel to catch on fire?

07:33.410 --> 07:37.980
And it's a myth that's perfectly
portrayed in this viral video.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.099
When the hooked fish flees,

07:40.100 --> 07:44.010
the friction on the spool
causes the reel to first smoke,

07:44.580 --> 07:47.000
and then catch fire.

07:47.590 --> 07:49.890
But is this really real?

07:51.410 --> 07:52.800
All right, so I got to say,
right off the bat,

07:52.801 --> 07:54.769
the physics of this myth add up.

07:54.770 --> 07:56.419
I mean a spinning reel

07:56.420 --> 07:58.698
will experience friction and
that will generate heat.

07:58.699 --> 08:01.080
But to generate enough heat
to actually combust,

08:01.081 --> 08:03.360
we're talking about a pretty big fish.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.629
Well, we do have big fish in our bay,

08:05.630 --> 08:07.290
I mean we have sturgeon, we have shark.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.660
Maybe we charter a boat
and see if we get lucky.

08:09.850 --> 08:12.900
Yeah, who knows?
We could catch a giant monster fish

08:12.940 --> 08:15.249
that would fight the line
and confirm the myth.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.850
All right, let's hit the high seas.

08:16.870 --> 08:19.790
- Don't forget to pack your seasick pills.
- No, I won't.

08:19.850 --> 08:21.340
And your alarm clock,

08:21.780 --> 08:24.690
because this is a myth that starts early.

08:24.780 --> 08:26.569
You guys ready to catch a fish?

08:26.570 --> 08:28.510
- This is our boat.
- You bet.

08:28.860 --> 08:30.680
To put the flaming reel myth to the test,

08:30.681 --> 08:33.120
we got up at the crack of dawn

08:33.130 --> 08:36.179
and strolled down Fisherman
Wharf to get on to this boat.

08:36.220 --> 08:38.929
Wacky Jacky, the saltiest
sailor I have ever met,

08:38.929 --> 08:40.289
is gonna take us out sport fishing,

08:40.291 --> 08:42.570
so that we can see if we
can catch a reel on fire.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.490
Now, this whole myth

08:44.491 --> 08:46.749
is to see whether or not you can create

08:46.750 --> 08:48.560
enough friction on your reel

08:48.620 --> 08:52.259
that it gets so hot, that it
actually bursts into flames.

08:52.260 --> 08:54.220
And that's why we're out here on the bay,

08:54.330 --> 08:57.760
to see if we can catch a big
fish and make that happen.

08:57.910 --> 09:01.709
A strong, fast fish like
a sturgeon or a shark

09:01.710 --> 09:04.950
could easily create friction
to heat up the reel.

09:04.980 --> 09:06.820
Catch me a big one!

09:06.850 --> 09:10.270
But will it be enough to set it on fire?

09:11.420 --> 09:13.059
I got...

09:13.060 --> 09:15.110
I got nothing.

09:16.640 --> 09:20.590
Well, so far nothing's
taking the bait to find out.

09:21.370 --> 09:23.630
Is fishing always this much fun?

09:24.500 --> 09:27.010
After eight hours without a single bite,

09:27.380 --> 09:29.860
the team decides to head on home.

09:29.980 --> 09:30.920
So, how we do test this myth

09:30.930 --> 09:32.350
if we can't catch any fish?

09:32.351 --> 09:34.559
I don't know.
I mean we've been out here all day

09:34.560 --> 09:36.950
and all we have to show for is bait.

09:36.970 --> 09:39.809
Yeah, apparently we are terrible fishermen.

09:39.810 --> 09:40.828
So you want to go back to the shop

09:40.829 --> 09:41.968
and figure out a way to do this

09:41.969 --> 09:43.110
without actually fishing?

09:43.130 --> 09:44.840
That sounds like a great idea.

09:45.410 --> 09:48.370
Later, Tory catches the one that got away.

09:48.420 --> 09:52.230
That is a fast fish!
We got ourselves a big one!

09:52.350 --> 09:55.709
But next, will there be tire fix trouble?

09:55.710 --> 09:58.270
Jamie's baby carriage had
wheels just like this.

10:06.060 --> 10:09.290
Since its creation thousands of years ago,

10:09.420 --> 10:12.650
the wheel has never really been improved...

10:15.300 --> 10:18.899
...until now. As Adam
and Jamie reinvent it,

10:18.900 --> 10:22.200
testing mythical methods for fixing a flat.

10:23.190 --> 10:26.540
And with hay a success, what's next?

10:26.940 --> 10:30.950
Next up, we're branching out to
other solutions for a flat tire.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.640
Yep, next up is surely a "clutching
at straws" type solution.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.810
- Uh-huh.
- I will try not to hurt you.

10:40.170 --> 10:42.610
That's a lovely little ski there.

10:42.640 --> 10:46.840
A branch forced under and
then tied to the flat tire.

10:48.700 --> 10:52.950
It's not pretty, but fans have
said that this really works.

10:53.430 --> 10:55.430
If you want to move something
heavy across the ground,

10:55.431 --> 10:57.579
you got a couple of basic choices really.

10:57.580 --> 11:01.089
You can do it with a wheel or
you can do it with a sled.

11:01.090 --> 11:03.829
And what we've got here is a makeshift sled

11:03.830 --> 11:06.400
built out of a tree branch and some rope.

11:06.490 --> 11:09.570
It ought to work. At least for a while.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.790
But it will last for a
full lap of their course?

11:13.990 --> 11:15.150
Go!

11:19.750 --> 11:24.220
Well, to say it's a slow start
would be an understatement.

11:25.660 --> 11:28.010
Eventually Jamie does get a grip.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.835
Yes, yes!

11:29.920 --> 11:32.270
But they're certainly not
out of the woods yet.

11:32.470 --> 11:34.870
All right. Here we go.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.950
We're on the road.

11:37.300 --> 11:41.360
Oh, don't slow down for anything.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.610
After slipping and sliding their way

11:43.611 --> 11:45.620
through the first 200 yards of their lap...

11:46.900 --> 11:48.630
- The control is a little rough, huh?
- Yeah.

11:49.340 --> 11:52.720
...they meet the first major
obstacle, the speed bump...

11:53.680 --> 11:55.210
Go, go, go!

11:55.230 --> 11:58.890
...which causes their car
to come to a standstill.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.099
- Come on!
- The log came out.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.540
- No!
- Yeah.

12:04.310 --> 12:06.430
There's your problem.

12:06.570 --> 12:09.409
- It came out? Oh, it came out.
- Yeah.

12:09.410 --> 12:10.350
It abraded through all

12:10.351 --> 12:12.810
of the tie ropes up there
close to the wheel.

12:12.840 --> 12:16.100
That was pretty interesting, though,
going down the road sideways.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.860
This track here pretty much
tells the whole story.

12:20.861 --> 12:23.110
You can see the log's still in place,

12:23.180 --> 12:25.679
and then it hits this bump.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.550
It sort of digs in and
gets yanked out of place,

12:28.800 --> 12:32.870
and from here on in, it's
pretty much just momentum.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.559
With the branch busted
literally and metaphorically,

12:36.560 --> 12:39.240
it's on to the final forest fix.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.760
You may see a couple of logs here.

12:42.770 --> 12:44.460
I see a tire.

12:44.470 --> 12:46.310
Once Jamie's got the good wood,

12:46.350 --> 12:49.500
his next job is to make
it as circular as he can...

12:51.240 --> 12:52.850
Looks very round to me.

12:54.770 --> 12:56.869
...before the guys jump cut their way

12:56.870 --> 13:00.130
through the rest of their final
improvisation technique.

13:01.870 --> 13:05.080
That is, without a doubt, the ugliest
tire change I've ever seen.

13:05.210 --> 13:08.010
If you saw somebody doing
this on the side of the road...

13:08.020 --> 13:10.400
You'd be like, "can I help you in any way"?

13:10.510 --> 13:13.400
No, I think I'll just leave... quickly.

13:13.410 --> 13:16.559
Will it work?
I don't think I'd want to go very fast

13:16.560 --> 13:18.010
on this particular wheel.

13:18.090 --> 13:21.340
But it seems like it's pretty solid.

13:21.570 --> 13:23.720
I think it's going to be the best one yet.

13:23.740 --> 13:26.540
Well, there's only one way to find out.

13:28.410 --> 13:30.740
Roll along, little wheel.

13:31.540 --> 13:33.370
It's working good.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.469
Remember, it's only the wheel
that they've tinkered with.

13:36.470 --> 13:38.949
The suspension, brakes and steering

13:38.950 --> 13:41.730
are all completely untouched.

13:42.470 --> 13:44.340
Okay, here we go. Speed bump!

13:44.390 --> 13:47.450
So will the log help or hinder?

13:47.530 --> 13:50.090
Oh, yeah! It made it.

13:51.240 --> 13:54.240
- That did fine.
- It did totally perfectly.

13:54.310 --> 13:57.430
It's certainly a case of so far so good,

13:57.470 --> 13:59.840
but how will the potholes fare?

13:59.860 --> 14:02.840
I'm nervous about the pothole.

14:02.930 --> 14:05.160
Back wheel, back wheel's good.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.720
- Not a problem.
- Not a problem.

14:07.850 --> 14:11.160
With both the potholes
and the puddles passed...

14:11.660 --> 14:14.770
Oh, yeah. No problem.

14:14.930 --> 14:18.770
...it's not long before the
MythBusters come full circle.

14:19.060 --> 14:22.990
Hey, hey. It's beautiful!

14:24.300 --> 14:26.270
Well, with our first
prototype fully tested,

14:26.271 --> 14:28.899
the "MythBusters" Tire Company is ready

14:28.900 --> 14:30.740
to open its doors for business.

14:30.750 --> 14:34.330
This little baby worked
magnificently on our course.

14:34.340 --> 14:38.690
It was, in fact, the best of all impromptu
solutions that we have yet tried.

14:39.490 --> 14:40.770
So, log wheel.

14:41.020 --> 14:43.150
- Totally confirmed.
- Yep.

14:43.310 --> 14:44.530
- Let's go.
- All right.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.549
As the guys head on home,

14:46.550 --> 14:50.080
the fixing a flat myth
is far from finished.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.389
Later, Adam and Jamie hit the town

14:55.390 --> 14:57.570
for more fabled fixes.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.400
Check out your dubs, homey.

15:00.420 --> 15:01.110
But next...

15:01.111 --> 15:02.950
All right. We're at maximum speed.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.590
...the guys focus on the friction factors.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.010
Getting red hot.

15:07.011 --> 15:09.380
Starting to smoke. It's smoking.

15:15.400 --> 15:20.000
Can a super fast fish ever
set a fishing reel a blames?

15:21.110 --> 15:24.120
Well, not if the MythBusters
are anything to go by.

15:24.530 --> 15:26.650
Is fishing always this much fun?

15:27.200 --> 15:29.019
So based on our fishing trip,

15:29.020 --> 15:31.899
I think the only realistic way
to actually test this myth

15:31.900 --> 15:33.700
is if we build a fake fish.

15:33.790 --> 15:35.728
Well, this is just about a spinning reel

15:35.729 --> 15:37.340
creating enough heat to catch on fire.

15:37.341 --> 15:39.499
I mean we don't technically
need a real fish.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.799
I mean we just need a fish substitute

15:41.800 --> 15:43.570
that will pull the line out quick enough.

15:43.730 --> 15:46.779
Okay. How about this? We get a go-cart.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.178
If we're going to give this
a good chance to work,

15:48.179 --> 15:49.670
we should use something really fast.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.798
You know, the sail fish goes
about 70 miles an hour.

15:51.799 --> 15:52.990
It's the fastest fish,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.379
and a go-cart could
totally handle that speed.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.549
All right, I'm all in, except
for one exception.

15:57.550 --> 15:59.619
If we're going straight
to the extreme scenario,

15:59.620 --> 16:01.510
why don't we load our other bases too?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.620
Let's find the best reel
line combination that will

16:03.621 --> 16:05.600
generate the most amount of heat,

16:05.630 --> 16:07.170
and we use that for our go-cart test.

16:07.380 --> 16:08.179
Agreed.

16:08.180 --> 16:11.529
So, looks like we're starting out with
some bench tests in the shop.

16:11.530 --> 16:12.320
Awesome.

16:14.410 --> 16:17.610
So, with real fish proving too unreliable,

16:17.630 --> 16:20.130
the MythBusters are going
to build their own.

16:22.120 --> 16:25.490
But first, they're focusing
on the friction factors.

16:26.070 --> 16:28.550
We're going to start out
by testing the line.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.760
Now, for this experiment,

16:29.761 --> 16:33.829
the reel, the washers, and the
lube will all remain the same.

16:33.830 --> 16:35.829
The only thing that's gonna
change is the line.

16:35.830 --> 16:37.499
And the lines that we're gonna be testing

16:37.500 --> 16:39.169
are monofilament, dacron,

16:39.170 --> 16:42.480
steel cable and braided solid spectra.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.499
Whichever line generates the highest heat

16:45.500 --> 16:48.450
is the one they'll use for
their full scale test.

16:49.060 --> 16:52.579
So this machine will be simulating
the fish at the end of the line.

16:52.580 --> 16:55.070
I'm bringing up the speed
using the foot pedal,

16:55.220 --> 16:56.940
and guide it on to the reel.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.719
And Tory will apply drag,

16:58.720 --> 17:01.820
and Kari will see how much
temperature we actually get.

17:01.920 --> 17:05.660
All right. Let's begin with the
80 pound monofilament test.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.810
Okay. All right, hold on.
We're missing one thing.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.000
- Yes!
- Just in case this myth is true,

17:12.069 --> 17:13.800
we've just got to be prepared.

17:13.810 --> 17:14.770
All right. Let's do it.

17:14.780 --> 17:16.550
With the safety set,

17:16.770 --> 17:19.189
the guys pull the 400 yards of line

17:19.190 --> 17:21.000
at 20 miles an hour...

17:21.550 --> 17:23.719
All right. We're at maximum speed.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.709
...before Tory engages the drag,

17:25.710 --> 17:28.060
a kind of braking system...

17:28.069 --> 17:30.040
All right, go into full drag.

17:30.420 --> 17:33.410
...which will take the friction
up to the max.

17:33.890 --> 17:36.820
Stop. Okay. We're at the end of our line.

17:36.850 --> 17:38.030
All right, what do you got, Byron?

17:38.680 --> 17:40.189
Oh, look at that things' glowing.

17:40.190 --> 17:43.920
Looks like we're maxing out at 105 degrees.

17:44.370 --> 17:47.550
So the good news is that the
friction did heat up the reel,

17:47.780 --> 17:51.640
but the bad news is it's nowhere
near enough for a flame.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.570
Can dacron do any better?

17:55.110 --> 17:56.699
Crank her up.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.230
To maximum drag. Here we go.

17:59.540 --> 18:00.810
Okay. We're at...

18:00.811 --> 18:02.429
You can see the heat as it spools.

18:02.430 --> 18:03.370
- Look at that.
- Wow.

18:03.371 --> 18:05.670
Well, in a word, no.

18:05.730 --> 18:07.309
Because neither it...

18:07.310 --> 18:09.030
We peaked at 112.

18:09.050 --> 18:11.910
...nor the next fine line, the steel...

18:12.000 --> 18:13.600
All right, throw it into drag.

18:13.620 --> 18:16.260
...are close to setting the world on fire.

18:16.410 --> 18:18.120
118 degrees.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.280
Which doesn't bode well.

18:22.040 --> 18:25.749
The final fishing line
is 500 yards of spectra.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.540
- We're at full speed.
- We're at full drag.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.559
Having a very narrow diameter

18:30.560 --> 18:32.870
means more line can fit on the reel,

18:32.880 --> 18:35.110
which should mean more heat.

18:35.470 --> 18:38.200
I don't see any smoke,
that would mean no fire.

18:38.220 --> 18:40.489
Stop, that's the end of the line.

18:40.490 --> 18:41.320
What do you got?

18:41.460 --> 18:43.589
158 degrees.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.010
- I think we have a winner.
- That's pretty hot.

18:46.430 --> 18:49.320
Peaking at an impressive 158,

18:49.360 --> 18:52.520
it's this last line that will
be their weapon of choice.

18:52.570 --> 18:56.770
But the line's not the
only thing in this lineup.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.499
Now, the type of reel
that we've been using so far

18:59.500 --> 19:01.119
is a modern lever drag.

19:01.120 --> 19:02.770
What we're moving on to

19:02.840 --> 19:06.019
is an older type of reel,
called a star drag.

19:06.020 --> 19:09.940
Now, the reason we think that
this might burst into flames is this.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.839
The drag, all of the plates and washers,

19:12.840 --> 19:15.829
are encapsulated in this
tiny metal cylinder.

19:15.830 --> 19:18.470
So, there's no heat sink
to draw the heat away.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.449
It's gonna build up inside of here

19:20.450 --> 19:22.810
and we just might see some flames.

19:23.130 --> 19:24.489
That's the theory.

19:24.490 --> 19:25.100
Wind her up.

19:25.130 --> 19:27.520
A theory that their first new reel...

19:27.740 --> 19:30.010
Ok, we're at maximum speed.

19:30.210 --> 19:34.270
...a star drag 4/O
rapidly proves in practice.

19:35.410 --> 19:39.339
- 171, 172, 173, 174.
- Wow, that is hot. Wow.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.630
- The star drag is hot.
- 175.

19:41.640 --> 19:42.690
Stop.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.490
Oh, you guys, we got all the way to 182.

19:46.860 --> 19:49.730
It's a good start in this reel ordeal,

19:49.770 --> 19:53.590
but can the 4/O's big brother
beat that benchmark?

19:55.510 --> 19:56.810
Drag is on.

19:57.710 --> 20:00.730
Get the net ready. We got a big one.

20:00.940 --> 20:02.709
At just 20 miles an hour,

20:02.710 --> 20:06.310
the star drag rapidly reaches 180 degrees

20:06.360 --> 20:08.080
before this happens.

20:08.190 --> 20:11.119
- Getting red hot.
- It started to smoke. It's smoking!

20:11.120 --> 20:12.709
- Oh, my God.
- Keep going.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.479
We got smoke.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.429
Wow! 187.

20:16.430 --> 20:19.629
Get the fire extinguisher ready.

20:19.630 --> 20:21.749
- 223.
- That is incredible.

20:21.750 --> 20:22.820
230.

20:22.845 --> 20:25.149
All right, put more... Ow!

20:25.150 --> 20:26.530
Too much drag.

20:26.630 --> 20:30.520
You guys, we got this up to 245 degrees.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.260
So we've completed our reel comparison,

20:33.370 --> 20:35.320
and this is the winner.

20:35.380 --> 20:37.639
The limiting factor, though, in our tests

20:37.640 --> 20:40.879
was the amount of speed that we
could get pulling the line off

20:40.880 --> 20:42.540
and the amount of line we had.

20:42.610 --> 20:46.029
Now what we've got to do is
find some way to get more line

20:46.030 --> 20:48.570
off this spool a lot faster.

20:49.140 --> 20:51.740
And to do that, take one marlin,

20:52.470 --> 20:54.110
mounted on a go-cart,

20:56.660 --> 20:58.390
and head out to Alameda...

20:58.420 --> 21:00.370
All right, first mate, you
ready for your fishing trip?

21:00.371 --> 21:02.249
This's gonna be the best trip ever.

21:02.250 --> 21:05.620
...for extreme fishing,
"MythBusters" style.

21:05.850 --> 21:07.810
Coming up on MythBusters,
we answer the question

21:08.010 --> 21:09.600
if you ended up with one of these,

21:10.210 --> 21:13.460
could you replace it with one of these?

21:20.870 --> 21:22.050
In "Fixing A Flat",

21:22.240 --> 21:24.320
Adam and Jamie just hit pay dirt...

21:24.520 --> 21:26.250
Don't slow down for anything!

21:26.730 --> 21:27.970
...and that's got them thinking.

21:29.420 --> 21:31.320
Dude, I don't think we're
done fixing flats.

21:31.530 --> 21:32.550
What do you have in mind?

21:32.750 --> 21:36.430
I would like to redo this test,
but in an urban environment.

21:36.610 --> 21:37.280
Go on.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.420
Well, imagine you're in a
city and you got a flat tire,

21:39.610 --> 21:41.960
calling a mechanic
is totally not an option,

21:42.150 --> 21:43.560
but around you you've got all the things

21:43.770 --> 21:45.479
you might find in a city,

21:45.480 --> 21:46.909
metal, glass and wood,

21:46.910 --> 21:50.550
and you've got to use those
to improvise a working wheel.

21:51.140 --> 21:51.870
I like it.

21:52.050 --> 21:53.020
- Let's set it up.
- Ok.

21:54.240 --> 21:55.860
Well, at a rainy runway,

21:56.980 --> 21:58.530
it's time to find out.

22:01.200 --> 22:01.950
Look at that.

22:02.130 --> 22:04.430
Our backwoods solution lasted
all the way to the city.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.800
Well, now it's time for
some urban solutions.

22:07.970 --> 22:08.970
Absolutely.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.720
While you may see a lovely
view of San Francisco

22:11.930 --> 22:13.449
behind me through the fog,

22:13.450 --> 22:16.289
an empty runway and 100 or so cones,

22:16.290 --> 22:19.230
I see an urban obstacle
course and potential.

22:19.450 --> 22:22.520
Adam and Jamie will each focus
on their own urban fix.

22:24.160 --> 22:28.190
But first, they need to conjure
up a cityscape crash course.

22:29.470 --> 22:32.750
And with everything set, the
urban fixing can commence.

22:32.940 --> 22:34.150
Starting with Jamie.

22:35.780 --> 22:37.200
Technically there's nothing stopping you

22:37.201 --> 22:38.840
from rolling on a flat tire,

22:39.040 --> 22:41.150
other than sooner or later
you're going to cut through it

22:41.340 --> 22:42.860
and you'll end up on the steel rim.

22:43.600 --> 22:47.030
So I figure, let's just try
rolling on the steel rim.

22:47.460 --> 22:50.310
It's a typically simple
solution from the Hyneman,

22:50.560 --> 22:53.270
that begins with him
removing their log jam...

22:56.360 --> 22:58.750
- Wow!
- Well, that worked pretty well. Sort of.

22:59.140 --> 23:02.650
...and ends with him first
wrenching a tire from its rim,

23:03.300 --> 23:06.100
and then attaching that
rim to the wheelbase.

23:07.660 --> 23:08.440
Job done,

23:08.830 --> 23:10.899
in theory.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.750
As far as riding on a
steel rim is concerned,

23:13.130 --> 23:14.900
we've got a couple of things
to be concerned about.

23:15.460 --> 23:16.910
And the first is balance.

23:17.290 --> 23:20.140
This steel rim is a lot
smaller than a normal tire,

23:20.630 --> 23:22.830
and so it makes the car kind of lopsided.

23:23.550 --> 23:27.170
The other thing is that the steel
is not going to grip the road

23:27.390 --> 23:28.510
as well as a rubber tire will,

23:28.710 --> 23:30.610
and so we've got traction issues.

23:30.990 --> 23:33.320
Whether either of these things
turn out to be a problem

23:33.520 --> 23:34.550
as far as handling,

23:35.060 --> 23:37.160
that's what we're going to
run the course to find out.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.170
Steel rim, no tire,

23:40.680 --> 23:44.070
in three, two, one...!

23:46.290 --> 23:47.950
As per Jamie's prediction,

23:48.150 --> 23:53.130
the terrible traction
makes for a slow start...

23:53.930 --> 23:55.250
Feel that acceleration.

23:55.450 --> 23:57.450
...which means reaching
the required speed...

23:58.090 --> 23:59.710
Come on, you got to get
to 40 miles an hour.

24:00.210 --> 24:02.780
...before braking ahead of the wall...

24:02.805 --> 24:04.305
C'mon, almost there!

24:04.330 --> 24:06.230
...is seriously challenging.

24:06.850 --> 24:07.650
Stop, stop!

24:11.270 --> 24:12.140
Nice.

24:12.410 --> 24:12.920
All right.

24:13.110 --> 24:13.880
Right turn.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.360
But having not hit the wall...

24:15.630 --> 24:16.810
Into the slalom.

24:17.090 --> 24:19.600
...Jamie scrapes towards the slalom.

24:20.340 --> 24:21.730
You can do it faster than that.

24:22.490 --> 24:23.460
Faster!

24:24.720 --> 24:25.630
Yeah!

24:26.090 --> 24:28.510
...where despite trying to stay on track,

24:28.900 --> 24:30.610
he soon gets into a spin.

24:34.080 --> 24:35.020
Oh, yes. Yes!

24:41.770 --> 24:43.140
But after a quick recovery,

24:43.510 --> 24:46.820
all that's left is the parallel park,

24:47.930 --> 24:50.130
where slow and steady...

24:50.480 --> 24:51.720
You park like my grandmother.

24:53.690 --> 24:56.520
...puts Jamie's rim back
on the road to success.

24:57.460 --> 24:58.310
Nice.

25:00.020 --> 25:03.050
Handling on the steel rim
turned out to be not half bad,

25:03.490 --> 25:05.470
you just can't accelerate very fast.

25:05.690 --> 25:07.650
But I reckon you can go
a fair distance on it.

25:08.390 --> 25:09.800
Well, somewhere there's probably a law

25:10.000 --> 25:12.890
against leaving massive
scratches in the road,

25:13.120 --> 25:15.140
but as far as getting
yourself out of the jam,

25:15.440 --> 25:17.900
I'm thinking that the steel
rim worked pretty great.

25:18.220 --> 25:19.490
I'd totally go with it.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.830
With Jamie's rim firing
on nearly all cylinders,

25:24.060 --> 25:26.520
can Adam's mythical fix do any better?

25:29.110 --> 25:32.710
It's round, it's metal,
I think it's perfect.

25:34.010 --> 25:37.760
Without a mechanic to call or
a genuine spare to prepare...

25:38.480 --> 25:39.750
It's freaking heavy.

25:40.650 --> 25:41.840
...Adam's adamant

25:42.050 --> 25:45.270
that this manhole is the
perfect wheel stand-in.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.340
Look at it. Well, that size matches!

25:47.620 --> 25:49.320
I have a good feeling
about the manhole cover.

25:50.610 --> 25:53.400
Being almost identical
in size to a real wheel,

25:53.830 --> 25:55.440
all Adam has to do is

25:55.450 --> 25:58.040
cut out some bolt holes
and then bolt it on.

26:00.770 --> 26:02.930
But will it be better than Jamie's rim?

26:05.730 --> 26:06.650
That's tight.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.760
Check out your dubs, homey.

26:08.990 --> 26:10.060
What do you think of that?

26:10.580 --> 26:11.410
I like it.

26:11.810 --> 26:14.240
The manhole cover seems
like it's a perfect fit,

26:14.440 --> 26:16.670
but the problem is it's only an inch wide,

26:16.890 --> 26:18.370
therefore it's not gonna get traction.

26:18.590 --> 26:21.130
The other thing is that
it's made out of cast iron,

26:21.570 --> 26:24.220
and that is inherently kind of brittle.

26:24.440 --> 26:28.130
So if this puppy hits some kind
of a rock or a serious bump,

26:28.620 --> 26:30.080
we've got a big problem.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.140
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.190
All right.

26:33.380 --> 26:34.310
Here we go.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.580
Cast iron, manhole cover wheel

26:36.790 --> 26:40.590
in three, two, one, go!

26:43.280 --> 26:45.940
Despite a fire and brimstone start...

26:46.800 --> 26:47.560
Oh, yeah.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.680
Burn again. You know,
you're really losing energy.

26:49.870 --> 26:51.040
Here we go. Come on.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.590
...it's clear that this time, the traction

26:53.800 --> 26:57.630
is actually less tragic,
as Adam gets up to speed...

26:57.880 --> 26:59.030
You're going 40.

26:59.230 --> 27:04.280
...and back with relative ease.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.520
And, the slalom.

27:06.330 --> 27:07.640
Oh, yeah. Now we got it.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.550
Because the manhole
is such a good sized fit,

27:10.760 --> 27:12.550
the car's balance is much better...

27:14.540 --> 27:16.830
- Well, actually, it corners really well.
- Yeah, it does, it does.

27:17.110 --> 27:19.860
...making its handling
much less of a handful.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.220
That's it.

27:22.800 --> 27:23.660
Come on, baby.

27:23.880 --> 27:24.610
And when Adam

27:24.810 --> 27:26.460
messes up the parallel park...

27:27.720 --> 27:29.800
What was that you said
about my parallel parking?

27:30.140 --> 27:31.650
...it's operator error...

27:32.200 --> 27:33.140
Sorry.

27:34.460 --> 27:36.450
...rather than a manhole mishap.

27:37.330 --> 27:38.470
And we're done!

27:40.220 --> 27:41.240
Check out this wheel.

27:43.510 --> 27:44.680
Ha! It's perfect.

27:45.810 --> 27:47.550
I abused the crap out of that thing

27:47.750 --> 27:48.820
and there's not a thing wrong with it.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.460
I am really impressed
with the manhole cover.

27:51.650 --> 27:55.540
I expected the one place I'd
have a problem were with traction

27:55.780 --> 27:58.740
and the fact that it's cast iron
that it might actually crack

27:58.950 --> 28:02.010
when I was skidding to the
side like in the slalom.

28:02.710 --> 28:04.270
Traction was a problem,

28:04.480 --> 28:07.860
but this thing held up to the most
abuse I could throw at it in the slalom

28:08.070 --> 28:09.320
and came back for more.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.510
I like the manhole cover.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.580
It's got style.

28:12.840 --> 28:15.399
- It worked great, I'd say it's plausible.
- Plausible it is.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.440
And you know what?
It's given me some ideas.

28:17.720 --> 28:18.520
All right.

28:20.170 --> 28:24.010
Next on flaming reel, the
world's fastest fish.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.720
She drives like a maniac.

28:29.400 --> 28:32.580
Known as the cheetah
of the sea, the sailfish

28:32.800 --> 28:35.600
has been clocked at an
impressive 68 miles an hour.

28:38.040 --> 28:41.720
And it's speeds like that
that may be able to do this.

28:44.170 --> 28:47.830
Well, at Alameda, the MythBusters
are set to find out.

28:48.520 --> 28:49.310
We're here.

28:49.640 --> 28:50.680
I'll drop the anchor.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.160
Now it's time to ramp this myth up.

28:54.370 --> 28:56.650
We were not able to get the
speeds that we were looking for

28:56.870 --> 28:58.360
in our small scale test.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.210
- We got smoke!
- Wow.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.370
Hey, get the fire extinguisher ready!

29:02.710 --> 29:07.380
So we have a much faster fish, capable
of going up to 68 miles an hour,

29:07.600 --> 29:09.360
and we have a much longer run.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.459
With the same top speed,

29:13.460 --> 29:16.470
and mask, as record breaking sailfish,

29:16.750 --> 29:19.600
Kari's car is the perfect fish replacement.

29:21.950 --> 29:23.580
She drives like a maniac.

29:25.170 --> 29:27.840
And that means it's time to go fishing.

29:29.390 --> 29:30.540
So Kari is hooked.

29:30.760 --> 29:34.240
She's gonna take off down the
runway going 68 miles an hour.

29:34.450 --> 29:37.600
At that point I'm gonna
start adding drag to the reel.

29:37.830 --> 29:39.580
I don't know if this thing's
gonna catch on fire,

29:39.810 --> 29:43.260
but this fish is going three times
as fast as we did in the shop.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.780
This thing is definitely gonna smoke.

29:45.560 --> 29:48.290
But upping the speed
is not the only change...

29:49.150 --> 29:51.380
All right, Kari, you're
hooked, are you ready?

29:51.710 --> 29:54.490
...because they're also doubling
the length of the line.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.770
Go for it, Kari!

29:57.600 --> 30:00.470
Will this be the perfect storm they need?

30:02.000 --> 30:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

30:09.450 --> 30:10.680
Okay.

30:12.904 --> 30:14.904
All right. Applying the drag!

30:14.930 --> 30:16.510
All right. 86 degrees.

30:17.830 --> 30:19.700
Look at her go. 130 degrees.

30:20.060 --> 30:21.490
Started spewing oil!

30:21.700 --> 30:22.880
160.

30:23.960 --> 30:25.490
187 deg...

30:25.680 --> 30:27.230
190 degrees.

30:27.480 --> 30:28.470
Over 200.

30:28.670 --> 30:29.690
228.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.190
It's getting too hot to hold!

30:31.420 --> 30:32.950
Three hundred and twelve.

30:33.590 --> 30:35.560
With Kari sailing at 70,

30:35.780 --> 30:37.310
the temperature is soaring.

30:37.570 --> 30:39.140
480.

30:39.350 --> 30:40.670
480 degrees.

30:41.090 --> 30:41.910
White hot.

30:42.220 --> 30:45.550
We've got nothing but smoke pouring off.

30:45.770 --> 30:47.250
530 degrees.

30:48.260 --> 30:50.380
The reel's smoking like a chimney.

30:50.630 --> 30:52.910
Man, that's 530 degrees.

30:53.420 --> 30:55.210
But despite her best efforts,

30:55.430 --> 30:59.640
Kari reaches the end of the line
before the smoke turns to fire.

30:59.870 --> 31:01.870
So next step, we're gonna add more lube.

31:02.090 --> 31:04.460
Now, this is not as crazy a
scenario as you might think.

31:04.740 --> 31:06.170
Let's look at the components of the reel.

31:06.550 --> 31:07.620
The spindle is steel,

31:07.820 --> 31:10.459
there are brass gears inside,
the washers are asbestos.

31:10.460 --> 31:13.620
All these things have a fairly
high ignition temperature.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.510
However, the lube that goes inside...

31:16.920 --> 31:18.290
That's right, get it all in there.

31:18.770 --> 31:20.690
...has a fairly low ignition temperature,

31:20.890 --> 31:22.240
200 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.

31:22.500 --> 31:25.520
I think this really increases our
chances of getting ignition,

31:25.730 --> 31:28.330
particularly if we add a lot of it.

31:29.410 --> 31:32.320
So, with a significant
amount of lubrication...

31:32.550 --> 31:34.490
That's gonna be a slippery
deck of your boat, isn't it?

31:34.860 --> 31:37.850
...it really is now or never for this myth.

31:42.120 --> 31:42.870
80 degrees.

31:43.080 --> 31:43.980
Taking off!

31:44.400 --> 31:45.700
99 degrees.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.110
120 degrees.

31:47.310 --> 31:48.770
- It's spewing out oil!
- 150.

31:49.210 --> 31:50.860
200 degrees.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.500
We're getting smoking from
all over right now.

31:53.730 --> 31:54.820
238.

31:55.560 --> 31:56.910
266.

31:57.140 --> 31:57.910
Come on, get hotter!

31:58.120 --> 31:59.160
2... 300!

31:59.510 --> 32:02.270
Like last time, the temperature
of the reel rockets.

32:03.790 --> 32:07.420
That is the most amount of smoke
we have seen on this reel.

32:07.710 --> 32:09.570
But even with Tory spraying oil

32:09.790 --> 32:11.440
directly on to the hottest part,

32:11.660 --> 32:13.790
by the time Kari's motored her mile,

32:14.100 --> 32:15.870
there's still no ignition.

32:17.790 --> 32:19.910
Well, we got a lot of smoke,

32:20.270 --> 32:21.420
but still no fire.

32:21.620 --> 32:22.230
No fire?

32:22.430 --> 32:23.480
No fire at all.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.590
And that was with a long line,

32:25.820 --> 32:28.430
the best reel, and a lot of lube.

32:28.910 --> 32:30.430
And the fastest fish we could find.

32:30.630 --> 32:31.330
But you know what?

32:31.550 --> 32:33.190
This myth is totally busted.

32:34.110 --> 32:35.750
We really gave this myth a chance.

32:35.980 --> 32:38.520
We used the star drag reel
which generated the most heat,

32:38.760 --> 32:44.170
we let line run out for over
a mile, at 68 miles per hour.

32:44.450 --> 32:47.150
And then, we put a flammable
lubricant on the wheel.

32:47.420 --> 32:50.000
If this isn't gonna cause
some sort of flame,

32:50.240 --> 32:51.370
this myth is busted.

32:51.710 --> 32:54.070
Kari's right, even with the deck loaded...

32:54.300 --> 32:56.100
I'm getting smoking
from all over right now.

32:56.310 --> 32:58.920
...there was still no sign of a simmer.

32:58.921 --> 33:00.194
It's busted.

33:00.220 --> 33:02.550
Without doubt, it's myth busted.

33:02.950 --> 33:06.790
But as the saying goes, there's
plenty more fish in the sea.

33:07.010 --> 33:08.670
Maybe there's an even faster fish,

33:08.880 --> 33:10.310
maybe there's a monster fish,

33:10.510 --> 33:11.920
maybe there's some fish out there

33:12.130 --> 33:15.450
that is beyond what we know.

33:16.050 --> 33:18.830
And that is what we're going to do next.

33:19.110 --> 33:22.850
Find a really, really, really fast fish.

33:29.270 --> 33:29.990
Welcome back.

33:30.200 --> 33:33.270
Now, all this episode we have
been looking at innovative ways

33:33.480 --> 33:34.990
to replace one of your tires

33:35.180 --> 33:37.250
if yours goes flat or missing.

33:37.460 --> 33:40.650
And, we've tried some backward fixes,
those worked out pretty good.

33:42.910 --> 33:45.730
We tried a single manhole cover
as a replacement for a tire,

33:45.930 --> 33:48.080
we tried a straight rim as a replacement.

33:48.740 --> 33:49.720
And they worked pretty good.

33:49.960 --> 33:51.200
But we're not gonna leave it there, no.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.930
Actually, Jamie is interested in what it's
like to drive in a car on all four rims,

33:55.370 --> 33:57.290
I'm interested in what it's
like to drive in a car

33:57.400 --> 34:00.589
that has all four tires
replaced by manhole covers,

34:00.590 --> 34:02.070
so get ready for the race-off.

34:02.390 --> 34:04.249
You've heard of shirts versus skins?

34:04.250 --> 34:06.790
Now it's time for the hole
covers versus the rims.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.810
In the one wheel deal...

34:10.110 --> 34:11.530
Feel that acceleration!

34:11.659 --> 34:14.880
...there was little to separate
their two urban fixes.

34:15.405 --> 34:17.505
That's it. C'mon, baby!

34:17.580 --> 34:20.090
So now Jamie, in his original car,

34:22.139 --> 34:25.100
and Adam, in a car of his own design...

34:25.370 --> 34:26.300
It's done!

34:27.530 --> 34:31.010
...are going head-to-head
in a four-wheel fix finale.

34:31.300 --> 34:35.400
The goal? To see whose
urban solution is superior.

34:36.420 --> 34:37.880
Shall we change these puppies out?

34:37.905 --> 34:39.105
Yeah.

34:40.310 --> 34:41.190
You like my paint job?

34:42.130 --> 34:44.290
You know how I love a good flame pattern.

34:46.690 --> 34:47.370
The plan is simple.

34:47.580 --> 34:49.350
I'm gonna put four steel rims on my car,

34:50.120 --> 34:52.690
Adam's gonna put four
manhole covers on his car,

34:53.170 --> 34:54.310
and we're gonna race.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.170
We'll just see who does better.

34:56.929 --> 35:00.060
With a "winner takes all"
course featuring slaloms,

35:00.280 --> 35:01.999
barriers and bunting...

35:02.000 --> 35:04.310
Oh! That's a proper speed way.

35:04.530 --> 35:05.920
...Adam's confident.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.900
This contest is pretty simple.

35:09.140 --> 35:12.890
The low rider versus the knight rider.

35:12.915 --> 35:14.115
Slicing through the night.

35:14.130 --> 35:16.500
I think the outcome
is gonna be pretty simple too.

35:16.720 --> 35:21.210
I'm the guy in the flaming car, I'm
gonna smoke the hoosier.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.620
But Jamie's the man with a plan.

35:24.180 --> 35:25.600
Just like with rubber tires,

35:25.810 --> 35:28.730
these steel wheels will lose
traction if they break free.

35:28.970 --> 35:33.069
So, the key to success here is gonna
be for me to ride the accelerator

35:33.070 --> 35:36.840
so that I don't lose traction, but
I actually do get up speed.

35:37.700 --> 35:41.280
Jamie's right, this track
race is all about traction.

35:43.410 --> 35:46.420
Okay. Rims versus manhole covers.

35:46.620 --> 35:48.940
Whoever has more will take the title.

35:49.430 --> 35:52.980
In three, two, one...

35:59.650 --> 36:01.590
And right from the word "go"...

36:01.960 --> 36:03.640
He's already ahead of me, come on!

36:03.950 --> 36:05.800
...Jamie takes a commanding lead...

36:06.925 --> 36:08.125
Yeah, baby!

36:08.780 --> 36:11.670
...while Adam has just a
fraction of the traction.

36:12.810 --> 36:13.850
Oh, no!

36:14.530 --> 36:17.170
And although Jamie doesn't
have enough control

36:17.370 --> 36:19.650
to steer clear of the crash barrier,

36:21.470 --> 36:24.410
he is beating Adam hands down.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.060
Well, that didn't go
at all like I expected.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.770
Not only did I get no traction

36:32.980 --> 36:34.180
and couldn't get up to speed,

36:34.540 --> 36:37.030
but once I did, I had very little control,

36:37.260 --> 36:39.460
careening right into the water pyramid.

36:41.740 --> 36:45.740
And on the slalom, I'm spinning 360, 720s.

36:45.960 --> 36:49.580
I have absolutely no traction
with these manhole covers.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.080
No!

36:51.410 --> 36:52.300
No!

36:52.590 --> 36:53.520
As I'm doing this,

36:53.740 --> 36:55.589
I'm watching Jamie serenely,

36:55.590 --> 37:00.029
like the turtle from that
cartoon, slow and steady,

37:00.030 --> 37:03.250
making his way unnervingly
around all of the slalom cones,

37:03.660 --> 37:05.620
and then he goes through the finish line,

37:05.820 --> 37:08.740
and incessantly turns
around and waits for me...

37:09.810 --> 37:10.630
I won!

37:12.820 --> 37:14.870
...watches me spin out

37:15.110 --> 37:16.880
and slowly making my way all the way

37:17.110 --> 37:20.060
to the finish line 19 seconds later.

37:21.300 --> 37:22.950
Adam said he was gonna smoke me,

37:23.140 --> 37:25.079
but I don't think so.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.080
I actually whooped it.

37:27.180 --> 37:28.530
I also was really surprised,

37:28.740 --> 37:31.530
because I thought he had
more traction than I did.

37:31.960 --> 37:32.910
Turns out he didn't.

37:33.240 --> 37:34.520
Ain't that the truth?

37:35.300 --> 37:39.820
The manholes, impeded by their
narrow nature, were next to useless.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.330
So rims win.

37:42.760 --> 37:43.810
What did we learn?

37:44.030 --> 37:46.900
Well, I think throughout this
whole episode we've learned

37:47.120 --> 37:49.749
that a flat tire does not
necessarily incapacitate you,

37:49.750 --> 37:51.889
pretty much every last thing we tried

37:51.890 --> 37:54.030
worked to some degree, albeit it slowly.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.320
Just goes to show a little ingenuity
will take you a long way.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.320
It sure will. Let's get out of here.

38:03.530 --> 38:04.910
All right. This myth is busted.

38:05.120 --> 38:06.390
We went 70 miles an hour,

38:06.580 --> 38:08.580
the fastest a fish can go for over a mile,

38:08.760 --> 38:10.080
and all we got was smoke.

38:10.340 --> 38:13.390
And that was giving it the best
possible chances of it working.

38:13.690 --> 38:16.390
But I'm still curious, can
you set a reel on fire

38:16.600 --> 38:18.110
by just spinning it fast enough?

38:18.300 --> 38:20.600
I think it's time we replicate the results.

38:20.990 --> 38:22.250
Well, you know what that means.

38:22.460 --> 38:26.250
We need something that goes faster
than any fish ever recorded.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.280
We need a superfish.

38:29.650 --> 38:31.010
So, back at the runway,

38:32.490 --> 38:36.800
it's time for "MythBusters
Extreme Fishing", take two.

38:37.020 --> 38:38.080
Towards my favorite time of the myth,

38:38.320 --> 38:39.680
where we replicate the results.

38:39.880 --> 38:42.539
We got our boat, we got
our reel, we got our line,

38:42.540 --> 38:45.200
and we got a really big fast fish.

38:49.050 --> 38:53.599
My friends, let me present
this motorcycle side car

38:53.600 --> 38:58.510
professional racing rig, otherwise
known as "Sharkus Maximus".

38:59.220 --> 39:01.870
With a top speed of 200 miles an hour,

39:02.500 --> 39:06.980
this road racing side car,
piloted by pro driver Mike Jones

39:07.690 --> 39:11.770
and his counterbalancing
assistant, is the real deal.

39:12.570 --> 39:16.540
But, upping the speed of the fish
isn't the only switcheroo.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.380
So far we've exhausted everything,

39:19.600 --> 39:22.020
and we have not been able
to get a reel to catch on fire,

39:22.240 --> 39:25.810
so we decided to switch to a
more flammable lubricant.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.650
Engine starting fluid.

39:27.870 --> 39:30.480
Now, this proved to be the most
effective back at the shop.

39:30.700 --> 39:31.990
It is basically ether.

39:32.220 --> 39:34.900
It is very flammable, has
a low ignition temperature,

39:35.140 --> 39:37.780
the only problem is it makes you
dizzy and it evaporates quickly.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.070
But we're gonna see how this does
on our fishing reel.

39:40.510 --> 39:41.450
And with that...

39:41.910 --> 39:43.220
All right. You're all hooked up.

39:43.460 --> 39:47.150
...it's time for this finale
to shape up or ship out.

39:48.120 --> 39:49.070
Ready to go fishing?

39:49.620 --> 39:50.450
I'm ready.

39:50.740 --> 39:51.650
Is the shark ready?

39:53.530 --> 39:57.000
Yeah. All right. Here we go.

39:57.210 --> 40:00.790
Shark's away, in three, two, one, go!

40:03.730 --> 40:05.110
All right. Putting the drag on.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.710
We're on to... 245, 300.

40:07.930 --> 40:08.750
Putting on the drag.

40:08.970 --> 40:10.890
We're up to 475!

40:11.110 --> 40:12.510
600.

40:12.730 --> 40:14.330
700!

40:15.050 --> 40:16.030
Oh, my gosh.

40:16.760 --> 40:17.970
700 degrees.

40:20.514 --> 40:22.514
- Oh, man!
- Wow!

40:22.540 --> 40:26.630
- How much?
- We got up to 700 degrees red hot.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.500
We broke the line.

40:28.550 --> 40:29.570
We broke the line!

40:30.690 --> 40:34.620
Despite the daring duo
hitting 140 miles an hour,

40:34.870 --> 40:37.710
the reel hitting 700 degrees,

40:37.740 --> 40:40.530
and Tory adding close to a cup of ether,

40:40.960 --> 40:42.930
there was still no ignition,

40:43.260 --> 40:45.540
which leaves just one thing left to try:

40:48.130 --> 40:49.250
more speed.

40:49.910 --> 40:52.830
And for that, Kari's taking no chances.

40:54.090 --> 40:56.250
Kari, don't you think
that's a little overkill?

40:56.760 --> 40:57.980
Oh, my God.

40:58.180 --> 40:59.730
- Ready?
- That is hilarious.

41:00.820 --> 41:02.990
Okay. I'll spray the starter fluid.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.290
Let's get our reel on.

41:05.190 --> 41:06.900
In three, two, one...

41:07.110 --> 41:07.990
...hit it!

41:09.940 --> 41:12.010
Both racer Mike and his mate

41:12.180 --> 41:15.260
and the temperature of the reel rocket up.

41:15.470 --> 41:16.990
We got ourselves a big one this time.

41:17.170 --> 41:18.480
95, 100.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.800
Holy crap. He's flying.

41:23.660 --> 41:25.099
I'm on full drag right now.

41:25.100 --> 41:26.100
200.

41:26.125 --> 41:27.325
380.

41:28.440 --> 41:29.410
400!

41:29.650 --> 41:33.250
This time, the shark's speeding
at 180 miles an hour.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.090
600.

41:35.370 --> 41:37.760
But when the temperature passes 700...

41:40.470 --> 41:41.370
This is ridiculous.

41:41.590 --> 41:43.870
...the line melts, but doesn't ignite.

41:44.350 --> 41:45.750
There is no way this myth is true,

41:45.940 --> 41:47.350
but we need to see this
thing catch on fire.

41:47.790 --> 41:50.850
Without doubt, they got the
hottest reel possible.

41:51.080 --> 41:54.640
But that heat within the
reel was still not enough

41:54.860 --> 41:56.870
to ignite their fuel on the line.

41:57.120 --> 42:00.990
So, as a last resort, Tory
adds one final ingredient.

42:01.210 --> 42:03.849
A 1200 degree flame and...

42:03.850 --> 42:09.370
Finally. You know how long I've been
waiting to see a flaming reel?

42:10.920 --> 42:12.680
Now this is MythBusters fishing!

42:13.550 --> 42:16.090
Finally, there's fire in the hole.

42:16.330 --> 42:19.760
But only thanks to a naked
flame burning 500 degrees

42:19.990 --> 42:22.670
hotter than anything
their fish could create.

42:24.360 --> 42:27.470
It wasn't until we introduced
an open flame to the reel

42:27.690 --> 42:29.390
did we ever see a flaming reel.

42:29.650 --> 42:32.400
This one is busted on every level.

42:32.910 --> 42:35.589
In fact, you might say it's busted

42:35.590 --> 42:38.000
hook, line and sinker.

42:38.220 --> 42:40.800
Well, I have to say we've tested
this one thoroughly.

42:41.020 --> 42:42.470
Yeah, that was a great fishing trip.
