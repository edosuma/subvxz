BARRY: Previously on The Flash...

00:03.719 --> 00:04.721
<i>BARRY". We just beat Zoom.</i>

00:04.880 --> 00:06.370
Why does it feel like I just lost?

00:06.560 --> 00:08.562
I feel more broken than I've ever felt.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.764
Wherever you need to go,
whatever you need to do, do it.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.001
I'll be here.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.727
(GRUNTS)

00:16.920 --> 00:18.001
You're safe.

00:18.280 --> 00:21.284
So, what should we call
this brave new world?

00:21.440 --> 00:23.283
I was thinking "Flashpoint."

00:23.520 --> 00:25.124
My name is Edward Clariss.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.567
<i>Rivals should know each other's names.</i>

00:29.800 --> 00:32.531
It's like I'll be thinking of a
moment from my past and it vanishes.

00:32.759 --> 00:34.285
<i>EOBARD: This isn't your home, Barry.</i>

00:34.440 --> 00:35.885
It's a mirage.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.124
<i>Things are back to how they should be.</i>

00:39.720 --> 00:41.961
Well, for me, anyway. For you...

00:42.120 --> 00:43.724
I guess you'll just have
to wait and find out.

00:43.920 --> 00:44.967
Where's Iris?

00:45.200 --> 00:46.804
<i>WALLY: You know Iris isn't here.</i>

00:47.080 --> 00:48.127
They don't talk, Barry.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.130
Oh, God, What did I do?

00:51.960 --> 00:54.804
<i>BARRY: I made a big mistake.
I just couldn't take it anymore, you know?</i>

00:55.040 --> 00:58.442
<i>What happened with Zoom,
my dad dying, my mother's death.</i>

00:58.640 --> 01:01.086
<i>Me becoming the Flash, all of it.</i>

01:01.280 --> 01:03.328
<i>I wanted a new life,
I wanted to start over</i>

01:03.560 --> 01:05.483
<i>and that's what I did!</i>

01:05.640 --> 01:08.007
<i>But somehow I made things worse.</i>

01:14.400 --> 01:15.401
No.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.171
So I reset everything. I put everything
back to the way that it was before.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.607
Except some things weren't the same
anymore. Not even a little bit.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.410
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.529
-(SIGHS)
-Take a breath.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.329
-(SIGHS) You were talking way too fast.
-Yeah.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.000
- What happened?
-I really screwed up, Felicity.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.846
And this time,
I don't know if I can fix it.

01:36.440 --> 01:40.365
Okay, let me get this straight.
You ran back in time.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.601
Yeah.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.330
Stopped Reverse-Flash
from killing your mom,

01:43.520 --> 01:46.126
and then lived in an alternate reality
where both your parents were alive.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.321
Yeah.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.603
And then you restored the timeline,
came back to the moment you left

01:50.800 --> 01:53.121
-and noticed that things were different?
-Exactly.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.482
Does that just happen
when you travel through time?

01:55.680 --> 01:57.170
Do things just change like that?

01:57.360 --> 02:01.046
No. I mean, not like this.
I don't know, I don't know, Felicity.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.691
I don't know what I'm going to do.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.282
Okay, why don't you just run me through,
walk me through, what happened

02:06.520 --> 02:08.681
and we'll, uh, try and figure it out.

02:09.520 --> 02:10.520
So what changed?

02:13.800 --> 02:16.565
BARRY: <i>I knew once I got back last night
some things had changed,</i>

02:16.800 --> 02:18.245
<i>but before I could figure out
exactly how much,</i>

02:18.480 --> 02:20.721
<i>I had to deal with someone this morning.</i>

02:33.040 --> 02:36.408
You are not gonna get too far
on that thing anymore, are you?

02:36.640 --> 02:40.201
I will be taking these back to
the jewelry store you stole them from.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.880
But, uh, you can keep these if you'd like.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.320
(SIREN WAILING)

02:44.560 --> 02:46.324
Good luck with that. (CLICKS TONGUE)

02:48.400 --> 02:50.721
<i>BARRY". After he was taken care of,
I went to S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

02:50.920 --> 02:54.367
<i>and that's when I found out
a lot more had changed than I realized.</i>

02:54.560 --> 02:56.847
What kind of idiot still thinks
I can't outrun bullets?

02:57.040 --> 02:59.930
That guy should be the criminal poster boy
for what not to do against the Flash.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.282
- So what are we gonna call him?
-You mean, like, a nickname?

03:02.520 --> 03:05.126
Yeah, Cisco does it for all of them.
He's like the master of it.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.284
Can'tjust call him, "Suspect
on a motorcycle." What do you think?

03:08.520 --> 03:09.521
I don't know.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.889
I'll take this one. Uh, "The crook"?

03:13.440 --> 03:16.489
- Lame, that five fingered--
-How about, "Thief."

03:17.440 --> 03:20.011
He robs stuff.
Let's just call him, "Thief."

03:22.800 --> 03:25.087
Gotta get to the gym. Excuse me.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.806
The gym? What, is he, like, working out
now, or...

03:31.640 --> 03:34.484
You know, Barry, sometimes
your jokes just aren't very funny.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.761
I should get back to the paper.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.201
It's okay. I was just leaving.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.643
Hey, guys. Hey, Joe, look, hey, I'm sorry.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.650
Look, I know you guys aren't
speaking to each other right now.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.610
But I was just thinking
maybe we could talk about

03:52.680 --> 03:54.284
why that is, for a minute.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.641
- No. No, we can't.
-Dude.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.165
Okay, I'm sorry, look, I'm sorry.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.330
I just thought, I don't know,
maybe it would be good for you guys.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.329
Just to hear it said out loud.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.165
This is because of what he did, Barry.
Not me.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.885
-Iris...
-What?

04:07.960 --> 04:10.008
What could you possibly have to say?

04:11.160 --> 04:12.844
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

04:14.960 --> 04:16.370
I'll just see you at the station,
all right?

04:16.519 --> 04:19.125
Nicejob with, uh, "Thief."

04:20.519 --> 04:22.363
- Uh, give me a lift to CCU?
-JOE: Sure.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.006
So you're still
taking engineering classes?

04:25.520 --> 04:26.567
Yeah.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.810
Yeah. Cool.
All right, well, good luck with that.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.522
- What is wrong with you?
-Nothing.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.041
Are you trying to make me
as mad at you as I am at him?

04:37.200 --> 04:39.885
No, no. Look, I'm sorry. I...

04:41.200 --> 04:45.000
Guess I don't fully understand
why you're so upset at him.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.370
(SIGHS)

04:47.680 --> 04:49.489
Then maybe
you shouldn't bring it up again.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.401
Yeah.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.766
How about we talk about us instead?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.765
"Us"? You mean, you and me,
like, trying this thing?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.606
I just thought with everything
that's happened lately,

05:01.840 --> 05:03.888
and everything that you've been through,

05:04.040 --> 05:06.930
I wanted to make sure
that you still felt the same.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.687
Well, Iris, I did what you said.

05:09.880 --> 05:13.248
I went where I needed to go,
I did what I needed to do.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.408
And I'm ready.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.769
I never told you to do that.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.570
Yeah, no, you did.
Right there, on the porch,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.529
right after we beat Zoom, right before...

05:21.800 --> 05:23.564
- You kissed Iris?
-Well, not anymore!

05:23.800 --> 05:24.801
I've kissed Iris West twice

05:25.080 --> 05:27.242
and I have managed
to erase both times from existence.

05:27.440 --> 05:28.771
Man, I hate it when that happens.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.247
It's just the least of my problems today.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.089
Joe, hey. Hey, man,
um, can we talk for a second?

05:36.280 --> 05:37.725
Yeah. I just gotta drop this off
for Singh.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.447
Oh, Captain Singh's back.
That's just terrific.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.130
Yeah, why, did he go somewhere?

05:43.400 --> 05:45.482
Oh, no, maybe, I don't know, I--

05:45.920 --> 05:48.605
Is that cowl cutting off
all the oxygen in your brain?

05:48.800 --> 05:50.165
What? No, I'm fine, why?

05:50.400 --> 05:51.765
Because you've been acting
real odd lately.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.769
Asking why Iris wasn't at the house
last night

05:53.920 --> 05:55.445
and that stunt you pulled at S.T.A.R. Labs
this morning.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.483
You know damn well
why she's not talking to me.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.927
Of course. Because she...

06:00.120 --> 06:03.647
Because I should've told her
her mother was alive. But I didn't.

06:03.920 --> 06:07.447
Yeah, but she forgave you for that.
One would think that she would've.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.568
I don't know if she ever will. Or not.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.406
But you sticking your nose into it,
isn't helping, Barr.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.801
Good intentions and all.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.161
I was... Okay.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.131
- We found another husk this morning.
-Husk?

06:18.320 --> 06:20.448
Singh wants this processed ASAP.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.247
Yes, the skin husks
we've been finding around the city?

06:24.480 --> 06:26.164
The ones we think are attached
to the meta-humans.

06:26.440 --> 06:27.680
<i>This is now the fourth one.</i>

06:28.520 --> 06:30.966
Well, let's figure out what's
happening before there's a fifth.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.446
Yes, sir.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.327
- What... (MUMBLES)
-Deep breaths.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.162
Um, hello?

06:41.360 --> 06:44.489
Yes, hello, Mr. Allen,
I can still see you're there.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.047
And no, I don't want your help, thank you.

06:47.280 --> 06:51.842
What are you doing here? "Julian Albert,
Meta-Human CSI specialist"?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.526
I did tell you the meta-human conference
was only for two days.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.330
Okay. But this is--

06:56.560 --> 06:59.006
Still our lab, unfortunately.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.483
Yes, County forgot to mention
that significant detail

07:01.680 --> 07:03.682
before assigning me but...

07:04.040 --> 07:05.963
Here we are. Looks like
you and I get to be roomies

07:06.160 --> 07:08.401
for a little longer than we'd hoped.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.041
Roomies...

07:12.360 --> 07:14.362
There's a whole new guy at work
that you didn't even know about?

07:14.520 --> 07:16.204
Yeah, and he's worked there
for almost a year.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.885
And he doesn't like me very much,
apparently.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.049
Oh, that's impossible.
Everybody likes Barry Allen.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.049
You're like pudding.
Everybody likes pudding.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.005
Not everyone.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.367
Thirty-seven.

07:27.560 --> 07:30.484
<i>USCG". I hated that we never spoke.</i>

07:31.960 --> 07:33.246
<i>I think the thing that haunts me the most</i>

07:33.440 --> 07:36.410
<i>is the fact that I never told him
I loved him.</i>

07:37.280 --> 07:38.964
Or that I idolized him.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.484
<i>I have memories of Dante all the time.</i>

07:43.280 --> 07:45.442
<i>But they don't feel like gifts.</i>

07:45.640 --> 07:50.601
They feel like reminders
of what I did wrong.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.248
<i>I will never make
another memory with Dante again.</i>

07:59.080 --> 08:00.445
Excuse me.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.161
What are you doing here?

08:08.280 --> 08:10.931
Oh, I see. Now you wanna be there for me.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.085
I'm just trying to understand.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.121
My brother's dead.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.131
There's nothing to understand.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.000
Exit's that way.

08:20.520 --> 08:23.524
So you altered the timeline,
Joe and Iris don't talk anymore,

08:23.760 --> 08:27.003
there's a guy at work, new guy,
who doesn't like you.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.528
You never kissed Iris.
And Cisco's brother is dead.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.683
Admittedly, that is an issue.

08:32.919 --> 08:33.967
And what if there's more?

08:34.200 --> 08:35.611
Well, has anything here changed?

08:35.799 --> 08:39.441
(SIGHS) No, I don't know.
Everything seems the same, I think.

08:39.640 --> 08:40.765
Good.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.280
- Can I use... Hold on.
-(STAMMERS)

08:42.480 --> 08:43.686
- I'll be real careful.
-Uh...

08:57.160 --> 08:58.650

08:59.720 --> 09:02.326
He had a kid. He has a kid, yeah.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.725

09:05.320 --> 09:06.890
No. Are you...

09:08.040 --> 09:09.644
Oh, my God. it really can affect us.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.325
Okay, you know what,
I don't want to know anymore.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.370
Okay, I know this is a lot of pressure,
but everything's gonna be all right.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.961
- I screwed up everyone's life.
-Yeah, well, maybe you should tell them.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.810
I'm not going to tell them.
I mean, how's that gonna help?

09:18.960 --> 09:21.247
That's just gonna make everything worse.
I don't know how to fix this.

09:21.480 --> 09:22.481
Okay, well, you're gonna figure it out.

09:22.640 --> 09:26.690
If there's one thing I've learned from you
is that, with you anything is possible.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.570
Why, 'cause I'm the Flash?

09:28.800 --> 09:31.087
No. Because you are Barry Allen.

that everybody likes.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.411
The Barry Allen who's just like pudding

09:37.720 --> 09:38.881
can fix this.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.201
So go and fix this.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.247
Yeah. Okay, you're right, yeah.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.201
Now!

09:48.600 --> 09:49.601
- Right now?
-Yes.

Is that what you really want?

10:50.640 --> 10:52.608
<i>To make the visions stop?</i>

10:52.800 --> 10:55.246
Or do you want them to come true?

10:55.560 --> 10:57.324
<i>To be fast again?</i>

10:58.000 --> 11:00.241
<i>To have speed?</i>

11:00.560 --> 11:01.561
Yes.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.081
Do you want that other life?

11:06.080 --> 11:07.764
That's what I want.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.641
Once again you will have power

11:11.760 --> 11:15.321

JOE: Julian, I thought you could use
some help on this one.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.681
You know, the two heads thing and all.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.447
I don't need any help, detective.
Especially from him.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.047
What is that?

11:43.280 --> 11:45.282
Another epidermal husk, Allen.

11:46.040 --> 11:49.931
<i>A fully intact human pelt comprised
of nothing but the stratum corneum.</i>

11:51.480 --> 11:52.561
You see what I mean?

11:54.320 --> 11:56.641
Do we have any theories
as to what's causing them?

11:56.840 --> 11:58.444
Well, I'll take a wild guess at it.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.246
And say it's the same thing
that created the last four husks.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.449
Spalling could be caused
from toxic epidermal necrolysis

12:07.640 --> 12:11.087
maybe some kind of moist desquamation
from intense radiation exposure.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.281
We've had a lot of--

12:12.480 --> 12:15.165
Radioactive metas, yes, thank you, Allen.
I read all the case studies.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.685
I'll tell you what. When I figure it out,
I'll enlighten you then, shall I?

12:19.400 --> 12:20.686
Thanks.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.047
How have I worked with this guy
for the past year?

12:27.240 --> 12:29.971
- Yeah, you say that all the time.
-I'm sure I do.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.560
Julian,

12:32.560 --> 12:34.722
are you certain that
Barry can't take a sample or something

12:34.920 --> 12:37.002
-to speed things along?
-Ah...

12:37.480 --> 12:39.847
I'm sure, detective. Quite sure.

12:48.520 --> 12:49.681
You might want to get that
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

12:49.880 --> 12:50.961
Yeah.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.210
CAITLIN: You know there's really
not that much here.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.489
Yeah. No, I know
it's basically touched DNA.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.011
I had to steal a sample

13:04.200 --> 13:07.124
because our meta-human expert
wouldn't let me take one.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.810
Oh, you mean Julian Albert?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.604
Yeah, you know him?

13:11.320 --> 13:15.530
Yeah. We've known him for a while.
He's the best.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.442
- Um, you need me?
-No. I think I got this, but thank you.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.721
Okay.

13:23.560 --> 13:26.643
Cisco told me you showed up
to his bereavement group last night.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.367
Yeah, I did. He also tell you
it didn't go so well?

13:31.520 --> 13:34.364
It's only been a few months since
Dante was killed by that drunk driver.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.284
I'm sure he just needs
a little bit more time.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.369
Wait, but why is he so mad at me?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.128
Oh, no. I'm staying out of that.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.882
Cait, he'll barely look at me
unless other people are in the room.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.811
Maybe it's just easier
when the rest of us are around.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.121
Do you think maybe you could convince him

13:52.320 --> 13:54.163
to come with you to my house
for dinner tonight?

13:54.360 --> 13:55.361
Why?

13:55.560 --> 13:57.927
So I can try to fix things between us.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.690
Maybe between Joe and Iris, too.

13:59.880 --> 14:04.886
Just all of us together again in one room
and try to work this out once and for all.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.046
Think you can do that?

14:09.240 --> 14:12.687
Okay. But how are you gonna
get Joe and Iris there?

14:14.680 --> 14:18.127
Joe? Hey, Joe, um, so I talked to Iris

14:18.320 --> 14:20.243
and she just has a few things
that she wants to say to you.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.930
Barr, I thought I told you
to stay out of this.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.690
Oh, no, no, no. This was all her. I swear.

14:23.920 --> 14:28.005
So she just, out of the blue, decided
now she wants to talk to me.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.765
Hey, um, so Joe said that he'd give you

14:30.960 --> 14:32.769
what you needed
about the husk for a story.

14:33.560 --> 14:34.766
- Hi.
-Hi.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.241
Uh, what? He just decided
out of the blue to tell me?

14:37.480 --> 14:39.448
No one at the precinct will say anything.
Even Julian.

14:39.640 --> 14:40.641
Oh, I hate that guy.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.600
Yeah, you always say that.
Um, when does he wanna do it?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.962
Uh, tonight. At the house.
He said he's making your favorite.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.446
Okay, he's out of his mind.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.721
He knows I will not go back there,

14:49.920 --> 14:52.207
even if he does make
one of Grandma Esther's recipes so...

14:53.520 --> 14:54.931
- When?
-Uh, tonight.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.446
Tonight, yeah, at the house.

14:56.640 --> 14:59.883
At the house? She vowed
she'd never set foot in the house again.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.929
- Unless you made dinner.
-(CHUCKLES) Dinner?

15:02.120 --> 15:03.451
Yeah, like old times.
Or one of her favorites.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.449
Like Grandma Esther's recipes, maybe?

15:06.400 --> 15:09.131
Okay. I suppose I could make something.
Which dish?

15:10.080 --> 15:11.684
He said he'd make the chicken.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.451
- I hate the chicken. I like the noodles.
-Noodles, okay.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.681
Why are you out of breath?

15:15.840 --> 15:16.841
I'm not out of breath.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.411
Joe also thought
maybe just to take some pressure off

15:18.640 --> 15:20.881
that he'd invite Caitlin and Cisco.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.289
Okay, um, what time?

15:24.520 --> 15:25.646
7200.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.006
All right.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.968
Um, 7:00 will work by the way.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.281
Okay. But which dish?

15:32.480 --> 15:33.720
And I was thinking maybe
to take some pressure off,

15:33.920 --> 15:34.921
you can invite Caitlin and Cisco?

15:35.120 --> 15:37.361
That's a good idea. 'Cause if
we're gonna do this I gotta get started.

15:37.560 --> 15:38.766
Yeah. I got it. No problem. Yeah.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.047
- Barr...
-Yep.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.287
Which dish?

15:41.480 --> 15:43.801
Noodle dish, yeah. Noodle dish.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.090
This hits the spot, huh?

15:58.280 --> 16:00.009
You can thank Grandma Esther.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.806
No, I mean it's good, I just meant, um...

16:03.600 --> 16:06.285
All of us actuallyjust here together.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.880
I was actually thinking, um, that

16:10.560 --> 16:13.803
maybe it'd be fun if we all went away
together for a few days.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.411
Just, like, a little Team Flash vacay.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.761

16:17.000 --> 16:19.651

that's a good idea?

showing up all over town.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.127
I'm glad you're finally ready
to open up about them.

16:55.360 --> 16:59.410
Iris, I already told you
I can't tell you anything about this case.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.923
Really? Because
that's not what I was told.

17:03.680 --> 17:08.242
Strange. I was under the impression
you had some things to say to me, too.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.766
Isn't that right, Barr?

17:10.960 --> 17:12.803
Told you, epic fail.

17:13.480 --> 17:16.050
Okay, look, yeah. I arranged this.
I put all this together.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.720
I'm sorry, guys. Look, I just--
We're not acting like a team

17:18.920 --> 17:21.491
and I just wanted things
back to how they were. Just fixed.

17:21.720 --> 17:22.721
If you wanted things fixed

17:22.880 --> 17:25.770
maybe you should have gone back in time
and stopped my brother from dying.

17:29.560 --> 17:32.291
You want me to change the timeline
to save Dante?

17:32.840 --> 17:34.968

and stole everything from me.

with Zoom and your mom and your dad.

-think of it as the space-time continuum.
-Yeah. (SCOFFS)

23:51.280 --> 23:55.001
Whenever you go back in time, it breaks.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.690
- Now--
-For real, I mean--

23:59.840 --> 24:02.844
You can reset the timeline,
you can try to fix it,

24:03.120 --> 24:05.885
but no matter how hard you try,

24:07.320 --> 24:09.368
it's never going to be exactly how it was.

24:10.160 --> 24:14.529
Look, I've learned all this stuff
that I didn't know before, okay?

24:14.800 --> 24:16.450
- I'm not gonna make the same mistakes.
-Mistakes...

24:16.680 --> 24:18.045
Yeah, what you just said right there,

24:18.840 --> 24:21.366
that is the paradox of time travel
and also the paradox of life,

24:21.640 --> 24:23.563
I mean, if I only knew then
what I know now.

24:23.720 --> 24:28.328
Why have these powers
if I can't go back and fix what I broke?

24:28.520 --> 24:30.568
We're not gods. We're men.

24:31.040 --> 24:34.169
Who for whatever reason,
have been given extraordinary abilities.

24:35.880 --> 24:39.089
The question you need to ask yourself is,

24:40.080 --> 24:42.845
what kind of hero are you going to be?

24:43.320 --> 24:47.006
Are you just going to take a do-over
every time you make a mistake?

24:47.200 --> 24:48.725
<i>Or will you live with them</i>

24:49.560 --> 24:51.244
and move forward?

25:04.840 --> 25:05.921
Where's Barry?

25:08.440 --> 25:10.568
I need to tell you all something.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.046
The truth.

25:13.400 --> 25:14.606
The truth about what?

25:15.720 --> 25:19.281
(SIGHS) Okay,
uh, after Zoom killed my dad,

25:19.880 --> 25:22.406
after we defeated him, um...

25:24.120 --> 25:26.122
I wasn't in a great space

25:26.280 --> 25:28.760
and I felt like
the only way I could fix that

25:29.040 --> 25:34.080
was to run back in time and save my mom.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.965
You stopped the Reverse-Flash
from killing your mom?

25:37.200 --> 25:38.281
Yeah.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.802
Wait, so, is she alive?

25:41.120 --> 25:43.805
She was, for a few months.

25:44.800 --> 25:48.088
I lived with her and my dad.
I had a completely different life.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.089
I wasn't even the Flash for most of it.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.441
I don't understand.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.803
You created a whole other existence?
How is that possible?

25:58.480 --> 25:59.720
Um...

26:01.800 --> 26:04.610
This is the timeline.

26:05.760 --> 26:09.003
This is the point that we exist on it
right now.

26:09.640 --> 26:12.644
This past point is where
my mom was murdered.

26:13.160 --> 26:18.166
So when I saved her,
I created a new reality.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.640
A new timeline. I was living in...

26:21.840 --> 26:22.841
A mirror universe.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.685
It's called a Flashpoint, apparently.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.843
But you decided to leave it. Why?

26:28.320 --> 26:30.129
Life started to spin out of control.

26:30.320 --> 26:33.642
This guy, Clariss,
he was a speedster there, too.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.371
He was known as "The Rival."

26:35.680 --> 26:38.126
He caused a lot of problems. So, um...

26:38.480 --> 26:39.925
(CHUCKLES)

26:40.360 --> 26:44.206
I decided to run back in time again.

26:44.360 --> 26:47.364
<i>And let things happen
as they were supposed to,</i>

26:47.680 --> 26:50.445
in hopes of resetting the timeline.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.883
- But...
-But what?

26:53.160 --> 26:56.164
But, um, when I came back

26:58.040 --> 26:59.201
things weren't the same.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.205
You mean people. Like us.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.451
Yeah, yeah.

27:05.840 --> 27:09.731
Uh, I created another timeline.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.164
Uh, this is the one we're living in now.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.971
It's not as different as the last one.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.481
Not in large ways,
but in some ways and smaller ways,

27:17.680 --> 27:22.004
and, uh, meaningful ways for all of you
or anybody that's close to me,

27:22.960 --> 27:26.169
and I can't ever really
put it back together.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.929
Barry, that's a lot to take in.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.210
Yeah, it is.

27:38.360 --> 27:42.001
We got along in that other life,
my dad and I, didn't we?

27:43.560 --> 27:46.609
That's why you've been working so hard
to get us talking again.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.524
Okay, here's the thing, um,

27:48.760 --> 27:52.685
I will tell you what's different,
all of you, if you want to know.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.247
But you have to live
with those differences

27:55.440 --> 27:57.568
because I can't change it again.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.762
But at least you'll know.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.287
And you all deserve that choice.

28:02.560 --> 28:08.124
So you decided it was okay to change
things when someone in your family dies.

28:10.040 --> 28:12.122
But when it's someone in my family...

28:19.600 --> 28:21.443
I'm gonna go talk to him.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.121
<i>H9)'-</i>

28:31.240 --> 28:33.208
What are you working on?

28:35.640 --> 28:38.325
These are the gauntlets from my suit.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.805
And you probably
know nothing about that, do you?

28:42.320 --> 28:44.129
I'm really trying here, Cisco.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.971
Barry, I'm the one who's been trying,

28:47.720 --> 28:51.566
I've been trying this whole time
to get you to do this one thing for me.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.004
<i>But you kept saying, "No, Cisco."</i>

28:54.240 --> 28:57.323
"I can't, Cisco.
I would never do that, Cisco."

28:57.560 --> 28:59.403
And now you're telling me
you went and did it for yourself?

28:59.920 --> 29:02.651
Were you listening?
it went bad. it went really bad.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.445
I don't care!

29:05.800 --> 29:08.007
At least I'd have my brother back.

29:08.320 --> 29:10.004
Yeah, you would have him back. But...

29:11.000 --> 29:13.844
Because of it, somebody might have
something happen to them

29:14.000 --> 29:16.128
that's just as awful
as what happened to Dante.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.800
<i>Trust me, you don't want that
on your conscience.</i>

29:20.480 --> 29:22.608
It's a heavy burden to bear.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.447
And I don't know
how many times I've said this,

29:32.480 --> 29:35.211
but I'm really sorry about Dante, man.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.284
Sorry doesn't change anything.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.681
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

29:39.880 --> 29:43.851
But I can't go back. I can't change it.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.727
All I can do is move forward.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.207
I really hope you can, too.

30:07.560 --> 30:09.847
Hey, um, I need your help.

30:10.560 --> 30:14.360
It's the four words I seem to hear you
most often say, Barry.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.247
That and, "I hate that guy."

30:17.400 --> 30:18.731
Which the feeling's mutual, so.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.844
Mmm-mmm.
Okay, um, this is gonna be hard for you,

30:22.240 --> 30:26.086
but I just, for a second, need you
to imagine that we're actually friends.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.401
Can't do it.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.046
Friendly.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.687
- Equally as challenging, Barry.
-(INHALES DEEPLY)

30:32.240 --> 30:34.208
But I'll give it a whirl.
What are you after?

30:34.400 --> 30:36.084
I need to read your report
on one of the husks.

30:36.240 --> 30:37.241
Which one?

30:37.520 --> 30:39.568
The one from this morning. Edward Clariss.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.603
- Edward Clariss?
-Yeah.

30:41.920 --> 30:42.921
Why?

30:43.400 --> 30:46.449
It may help me figure out
a case I'm working on.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.287
Well, the nutshell is,

30:51.720 --> 30:54.564
the hyaluronic acids were found
to be above normal.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.286
- Androgen degradation atypically low.
-Mmm-hmm.

30:57.600 --> 30:58.601
<i>Cellular regeneration</i>

30:58.800 --> 31:00.564
<i>-seemed to occur at</i> a <i>staggering rate.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

31:00.920 --> 31:03.605
It's quite a bit different from the
previous husks that we found. About it.

31:03.960 --> 31:05.962
Could I maybe just take a peek at it?

31:06.160 --> 31:07.605
I'm sorry,
it's just something I need to see

31:07.840 --> 31:10.127
-to know what I'm looking for.
-(SCOFFS)

31:10.440 --> 31:12.966
- Sure.
-Great. Thank you.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.763
Wait, why does this say the body's
place of discovery was Williamson

31:18.960 --> 31:21.645
when it was found
on the waterfront in Leawood?

31:21.960 --> 31:23.962
The body ended up in Leawood.

31:24.160 --> 31:25.241
There was a strong current this morning,

31:25.480 --> 31:27.960
so chances are that it originated
from Williamson.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.963
Somewhere near the old Prescott sawmill.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.281
- You <i>done?</i>
- Yeah.

31:32.480 --> 31:34.130
Uh, yes. Thank you.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.005
<i>CLARISS: You found me again, Flash.</i>

31:39.160 --> 31:42.164
I wondered how long it'd take you
this time to figure it out.

31:42.480 --> 31:43.481
Wasn't too hard.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.211
See you didn't bring your sidekick
with you, though.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.488
Nope. Just me.

31:48.880 --> 31:51.724
That's too bad. I brought one.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.001
(GRUNTS)

31:58.840 --> 32:01.684
Oh, and, Flash,
a little, uh, quaking in your boots

32:01.840 --> 32:03.171
wouldn't be inappropriate.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.006
So?

32:12.000 --> 32:15.402
He changed our lives, Iris.
And he kept that secret from us.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.489
You really just want us
to be okay with that?

32:17.680 --> 32:20.081
All I'm saying, Wally,
is that he made a mistake.

32:20.360 --> 32:21.850
Yeah. He did.

32:22.200 --> 32:26.171
Cisco, we all make mistakes
to protect the people that we love.

32:26.720 --> 32:29.883
I mean, you told Captain Cold
that Barry was the Flash

32:30.080 --> 32:31.650
in order to protect your brother.

32:31.880 --> 32:34.326
Okay, not my finest moment.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.521
That's my point.

32:35.720 --> 32:41.727
It was one decision made in one moment.
One very heart-wrenching moment.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.048
Look, guys, we're like a family here,
okay?

32:44.240 --> 32:47.210
And sometimes families get mad
at each other for screwing up.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.566
<i>I know that all too well.</i>

32:49.880 --> 32:51.211
But they also forgive.

32:52.760 --> 32:56.890
Because after a while it just seems silly
when you stop and think about it.

32:59.840 --> 33:00.841
(IRIS CHUCKLES)

33:04.080 --> 33:06.082
Guys, Iris is right.

33:07.760 --> 33:11.082
We all have secrets, we've all screwed up.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.251
But this is Barry we're talking about.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.041
(MONITOR BEEPING)

33:17.240 --> 33:18.924

33:29.240 --> 33:31.083

33:31.760 --> 33:34.331

33:35.600 --> 33:37.602
Okay, well, what do you want?

33:38.240 --> 33:41.881
To help people
achieve their true potential.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.804
Such as he has.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.486
And why are you doing this?

33:45.720 --> 33:48.291
Because I'm preparing this world.

33:49.960 --> 33:51.291
(GASPING)

33:51.840 --> 33:54.446
Remember what happened here last time,

33:55.760 --> 33:57.285
It's where I died.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.121
(GRUNTS)

34:01.280 --> 34:04.250
And I'm not going to waste
this second chance I've been given.

34:05.240 --> 34:08.801
This time I'm going to show you
who's the fastest man alive.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.440
Barry!

34:14.960 --> 34:16.962
- Barry!
-His comms aren't working.

34:18.159 --> 34:19.525
<i>He's at the Prescott Mill.</i>

34:20.480 --> 34:21.811
That's right around the corner.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.324
We gotta do something.

34:35.120 --> 34:36.121

34:38.880 --> 34:40.803
Having fun yet, Flash?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.650
(GRUNTING)

35:04.360 --> 35:06.522
Time to look for a new rival.

Thank you.

35:46.360 --> 35:47.725
Sorry it took so long.

You're just in time.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.686
(EXHALES)

35:57.200 --> 35:59.601
Nothing, no mention of Alchemy anywhere,

35:59.880 --> 36:01.928
no mask-wearing monk metas,
not even close.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.523
I didn't find any known aliases
in any of the records at C.C.P.D.

36:05.760 --> 36:08.206
And Clariss won't say anything, either.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.609
All right, well, keep at him. Alchemy's
the one that gave Clariss back his speed.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.723
He's kind of like a doctor that way,
don't you think?

36:14.400 --> 36:15.401
Come on, don't pretend like

36:15.560 --> 36:17.722
"Doctor Alchemy"
doesn't have a nice ring to it.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.485
Okay, well, that explains

36:19.720 --> 36:21.722
why he didn't have
any traces of dark matter in his cells.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.888
He didn't get his powers
from the particle accelerator,

36:24.080 --> 36:26.321
he got them from Alchemy.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.722
- What's that?
-Doctor Alchemy.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.251
(CHUCKUNG)

36:30.440 --> 36:32.124
How could he do that?

36:32.400 --> 36:34.289
I don't know,
but we need to figure it out,

36:34.480 --> 36:35.811
there's going to be more.

36:36.080 --> 36:40.563
Alchemy... Doctor Alchemy has said
that he is preparing this world.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.006
- Preparing the world?
-Mmm-hmm.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.924
For what, like, the second coming
or something?

36:44.120 --> 36:48.921
I think that everyone that had powers
in Flashpoint is going to get them back.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.443
<i>JOE: Well, we already found
four other husks.</i>

36:51.640 --> 36:54.803
Which means there's at least that many
running around Central City right now.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.526
We need to find him
before he changes more people's lives.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.649
<i>IRIS: Speaking of changing lives.</i>

36:59.840 --> 37:02.286
We all talked about it, Barry. And...

37:02.480 --> 37:05.165
We don't want to know
what our lives were like in Flashpoint.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.650
You're sure?

37:07.800 --> 37:11.327
To quote the wise words of Harry,
"What's the point, Allen?"

37:12.440 --> 37:13.601
I gotta get to the precinct.

37:14.120 --> 37:15.804
Uh, stop by Jitters on the way?

37:16.320 --> 37:17.481
Yeah. It's on me.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.608
Oh, good. Then I'm coming, too.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.327
Yo.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.166
Um, I've just been thinking.

37:27.320 --> 37:31.689
It was pretty cool having someone
out there with me last night.

37:32.120 --> 37:34.566
Maybe we could make that a thing
every once in a while.

37:35.640 --> 37:39.850
I got some things to work on
before I start doing that.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.521
Yeah.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.527
Maybe someday.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.809
That'd be pretty bitchin'.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.166
Glad to see everything
starting to get back to the way it was.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.407
Yeah.

37:59.680 --> 38:02.365
I mean, mostly.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.560
You have nothing to worry about, Cait.

38:04.840 --> 38:09.209
I think out of everyone, actually, you're
the only one that wasn't really affected

38:09.360 --> 38:10.771
<i>when I messed with the timeline.</i>

38:11.000 --> 38:15.005
I mean, unless you're secretly
moonlighting as an ophthalmologist.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.565
A what?

38:16.880 --> 38:18.848
Kidding, nothing. Just a Flashpoint joke.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.081
I'll see you later.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.121
What's that?

38:36.280 --> 38:37.884
It's the finished Edward Clariss report.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.764
<i>Or should I say "The Rival?"</i>

38:41.040 --> 38:42.565
At least that's what the Flash called him
last night

38:42.720 --> 38:44.085
when he took him in to Iron Heights.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.403
<i>- Hmm.
- I thought you might want to see it.</i>

38:46.720 --> 38:47.926
You know, to do with your other case.

38:48.440 --> 38:51.887
Ah. Actually it turns out
there was no connection.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.640
(CHUCKLES)

38:54.040 --> 38:55.769
<i>- You know I have to ask you...</i>
- Hmm.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.722
- How did you know his name?
-What?

38:59.240 --> 39:02.483
Yesterday, you came in
and you asked for Edward Clariss's report.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.291
But I didn't tell you
who that husk belonged to.

39:05.440 --> 39:10.606
So that means you stole a sample,
when you showed up to my crime scene.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.645
How did you do that?

39:15.640 --> 39:16.766
<i>' 'L</i>

39:17.000 --> 39:19.082
(CHUCKLING) on, wow.

39:20.640 --> 39:23.962
You've really got this good guy
routine thing down, haven't you?

39:24.240 --> 39:26.322
And everyone just buys it.

39:27.800 --> 39:31.600
There is something not right about you,
Allen.

39:33.080 --> 39:36.607
They don't see it, but I do.

39:38.120 --> 39:39.326
- Is that right?
-Yes.

39:40.280 --> 39:41.281
(CHUCKLES)

39:41.520 --> 39:43.841
You know why I don't actually like you,
don't you?

39:44.800 --> 39:45.961
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

39:47.080 --> 39:48.764
I don't trust you.

39:49.440 --> 39:52.284
And I don't like things
that I don't trust.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.684
See you tomorrow... Roomie.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.291
- BARRY: Hey.
-Hey.

40:08.880 --> 40:09.881
Hi.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.803
I was hoping you'd be here.

40:14.800 --> 40:19.442
Yeah. Dad and I just polished off
Grandma Esther's noodle dish.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.330
Oh, did you leave me some?

40:21.640 --> 40:22.880
Too slow, Flash.

40:23.160 --> 40:25.367
- Oh...
-(BOTH CHUCKLING)

40:29.360 --> 40:30.691
3° YOU guys are...

40:34.000 --> 40:36.162
- We're good.
-(INHALES DEEPLY)

40:39.240 --> 40:43.040
Are you sure you don't wanna know
about the other timeline?

40:43.800 --> 40:46.246
No. I guess, in my mind,

40:47.520 --> 40:50.330
wherever you go, you'll always be Barry.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.529
And I'll always be Iris.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.363
And we always find each other.

41:32.560 --> 41:33.891
<i>ALCHEMY'. You failed.</i>

41:40.400 --> 41:42.801
<i>You failed, Clariss.</i>

41:43.760 --> 41:45.444
I'm sorry, please.

41:46.360 --> 41:47.930
Let me try again.

41:48.120 --> 41:49.485
(PANTING)

41:50.320 --> 41:51.560
Alchemy?

41:53.440 --> 41:55.249
No,no,no,no,no.

41:57.920 --> 41:58.921

42:27.520 --> 42:28.521
