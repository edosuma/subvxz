WEBVTT

01:12.407 --> 01:13.825
WE LOVE YOU!

01:31.468 --> 01:32.761
Present arms!

01:45.940 --> 01:49.152
I am responsible
for the death of those men, Eduardo.

01:51.279 --> 01:56.284
And if Escobar is using their deaths
to send me a message, then I will respond.

01:57.202 --> 01:59.037
I agree completely.

01:59.662 --> 02:01.498
We have to go in full force.

02:02.123 --> 02:06.377
Keep in mind... bringing him back
won't be a popular decision.

02:08.713 --> 02:11.341
But since when do we care
about being popular?

02:31.903 --> 02:33.404
Colonel Carrillo.

02:36.241 --> 02:37.992
Yes, Mr. President.

05:13.690 --> 05:16.985
Boss, they're all saying
they don't know anything.

05:17.068 --> 05:18.987
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

05:20.071 --> 05:23.574
You gentlemen are under the impression
that you work for the Moncadas.

05:23.658 --> 05:28.329
Allow me to clarify.
You have never worked for the Moncadas.

05:28.413 --> 05:31.582
You work for me,
and you have always worked for me.

05:31.708 --> 05:32.834
- Blackie.
- Yes, boss.

05:32.917 --> 05:36.170
Who gave Judy Moncada
the cash to buy this house?

05:36.254 --> 05:37.255
You, Don Pablo.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.506
- Jairo.
- Yes, Don Pablo.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.843
The money that puts food on the table
for these men, where does it come from?

05:41.926 --> 05:44.721
- From your pocket.
- Everything you see here is mine.

05:46.597 --> 05:51.728
Everything you have
is because I allow you to have it.

05:54.397 --> 05:59.110
Everything you think you are protecting,
you are protecting for me.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.613
Are we clear on this?

06:05.033 --> 06:09.120
You're going to tell me the location
of every safe house, every lab,

06:09.245 --> 06:11.706
every office,
every account of the Moncadas.

06:11.789 --> 06:13.041
And look...

06:14.584 --> 06:17.920
that doesn't make you gentlemen traitors.

06:19.589 --> 06:21.257
Certainly not.

06:22.050 --> 06:28.222
You simply didn't know
who you were really working for.

06:30.725 --> 06:32.435
So let's begin...

06:33.478 --> 06:35.313
with what's most important.

06:37.231 --> 06:42.653
You're... going to tell me right now...

06:44.572 --> 06:51.329
where that bitch Judy Moncada is hiding.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.809
- Ms. Judy, welcome.
- Thank you.

07:14.519 --> 07:15.686
Pardon me.

07:15.770 --> 07:18.106
- Hey!
- Navegante!

07:18.189 --> 07:21.526
- Watch yourself.
- Mrs. Moncada is our guest.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.820
We treat our guests with respect.

07:24.529 --> 07:27.365
Even the ones who invite themselves.

07:30.827 --> 07:35.957
Listen, Pacho,
are you sure you have enough men?

07:36.040 --> 07:38.668
One might get the impression
you're scared of someone.

07:42.004 --> 07:46.134
Perhaps if you took security
more seriously...

07:46.968 --> 07:50.805
just maybe your husband
would still be alive...

07:51.681 --> 07:54.392
and you wouldn't be coming to us for help.

07:55.643 --> 08:00.314
Listen to this guy.
Who told you I was coming here for help?

08:02.483 --> 08:04.235
Where's your boss?

08:06.362 --> 08:08.322
You mean my partner.

08:08.406 --> 08:11.576
- Handling the business.
- Is that right?

08:11.701 --> 08:15.413
So he's still trying to pretend
he isn't a drug trafficker?

08:15.496 --> 08:19.667
Mrs. Moncada...
why don't you go look around?

08:19.750 --> 08:22.670
I don't know, pet the horses.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.882
Or rehearse whatever it is
you came to say.

08:26.591 --> 08:28.926
Gilberto will be here shortly.

08:30.178 --> 08:32.513
Thank you, Pacho.

08:44.192 --> 08:46.569
Ma'am? Here's what you asked for.

08:50.406 --> 08:51.406
Who's that?

08:53.201 --> 08:55.203
He's one of the new guys.

08:58.122 --> 08:59.248
Excuse me.

09:04.795 --> 09:08.216
POLICE STATION ATTACKED IN MEDELLÍN

09:15.765 --> 09:18.643
What a hideous painting.

09:48.256 --> 09:50.091
What a lovely surprise.

09:50.174 --> 09:53.469
- To what do we owe the pleasure?
- Business.

09:57.848 --> 10:02.520
"And one by one, the nights
between our separated cities,

10:02.603 --> 10:05.606
they are added to the night
that unites us."

10:05.690 --> 10:09.610
It's the middle of the fucking day,
Gilberto.

10:09.694 --> 10:12.113
Not a fan of Neruda?

10:12.196 --> 10:16.867
The only thing that unites us in this life
is a desire to see Pablo dead.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.133
Gentlemen.

12:41.512 --> 12:44.849
So tell me, Mrs. Moncada,
why did you come all this way?

12:44.932 --> 12:49.270
To help you kill the man
who murdered my husband and brother

12:49.353 --> 12:52.940
by offering very important information
that only I possess.

12:53.023 --> 12:56.277
- And what is this information?
- Targets.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.612
The location of every one of his labs.

12:58.696 --> 13:04.785
Going after Pablo's infrastructure
will cripple him, force him to surface.

13:04.869 --> 13:09.790
When he does, we put a bullet in his head
and we take turns shitting on him.

13:09.874 --> 13:13.627
What's valuable isn't knowing
what Pablo has,

13:13.711 --> 13:15.796
but what he wants to acquire.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.965
Because that's where he'll be next.

13:18.048 --> 13:21.552
Pablo is picking apart your operation
piece by piece.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.805
Knowing what remains
tells us where he's going.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.686
You want me to tell you where my labs are?

13:32.480 --> 13:35.900
Well... let's say...

13:36.734 --> 13:40.237
that I share that information.

13:41.739 --> 13:43.073
What happens to my labs?

13:43.908 --> 13:45.493
Oh, Judy.

13:45.576 --> 13:48.329
Your sense of vengeance is heartwarming.

13:48.412 --> 13:51.373
Kiko would be so proud of your priorities.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.752
You're right.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.755
He would be very proud of me.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.842
I built the business by his side, Pacho.

14:01.926 --> 14:05.262
I'm from the Medellín cartel.
I know what I am.

14:05.346 --> 14:10.351
I don't need bullshit art
hanging on my wall to prove any different.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.394
Wait.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.064
Hold on.

14:15.940 --> 14:21.695
Confronting Pablo directly
won't help us maintain a low profile.

14:22.613 --> 14:23.697
But...

14:25.908 --> 14:31.121
what if the Search Bloc were to learn
the location of your labs?

14:32.206 --> 14:35.125
What good is it if he's arrested?

14:35.793 --> 14:39.630
He's already shown
he can fuck us from prison.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.091
This won't end with Pablo in a cell.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.593
You think the police will kill him?

14:45.970 --> 14:49.223
There is one officer
that seems particularly determined.

14:49.306 --> 14:52.309
And President Gaviria
has arranged for his return.

15:32.850 --> 15:36.854
Assemble the Search Bloc outside.
I want 100 men and six trucks.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.773
- Tell them we're moving out. Got it?
- On it, Colonel.

16:07.301 --> 16:10.304
- What's up?
- They just left. Four motorcycles,

16:10.387 --> 16:14.391
<i>five pickups, and a truck.
It's a large convoy.</i>

16:31.742 --> 16:33.577
They're heading to Barrio Escobar.

16:34.328 --> 16:35.996
<i>It's going to get crowded.</i>

16:46.048 --> 16:47.424
The convoy has arrived.

17:02.398 --> 17:03.857
We're in position.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.361
A MAN, A NEIGHBORHOOD, A COUNTRY!

17:24.461 --> 17:27.631
Look. Look up there.

17:27.756 --> 17:31.468
There's something weird happening.
What do you see?

17:31.552 --> 17:33.804
- They're clouds.
- No, not clouds.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.640
Because clouds form shapes.

17:37.599 --> 17:42.146
- What I see is a turtle.
- Boss!

17:42.271 --> 17:45.733
- Excuse me. I need to talk to you.
- Keep looking.

17:48.986 --> 17:50.821
Keep looking at the clouds.

17:53.323 --> 17:56.493
Sir, sorry to interrupt,
but it's very important.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.913
- What's going on?
- Carrillo is back.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.666
And he's here in Medellín.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.927
What else?

18:17.848 --> 18:21.143
That son of a bitch filled
Barrio Escobar with police and...

18:22.811 --> 18:25.147
he pissed on your mural, sir.

18:53.550 --> 18:57.721
<i>Those fucking cops
are going up 26th Street.</i>

18:58.305 --> 19:00.057
<i>Copy that, brother. All good.</i>

19:16.240 --> 19:20.744
Trujillo, load up six unmarked cars,
four men per car.

19:20.828 --> 19:24.414
Instruct them to leave in 20-minute
intervals to avoid attention. Clear?

19:24.540 --> 19:25.749
- Yes, Colonel.
- Okay.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.607
Freeze! Don't move!

19:53.527 --> 19:57.364
Relax. Everything's good.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.949
What is this?

19:59.616 --> 20:00.616
<i>Piraña down.</i>

20:07.416 --> 20:08.542
Son of a bitch.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.214
Where are you going?

20:15.090 --> 20:19.887
Get him!

20:19.970 --> 20:21.263
Don't move!

20:22.931 --> 20:23.724
Don't move!

20:23.807 --> 20:25.142
- Good evening.
- Yes?

20:25.267 --> 20:28.729
Would you allow me to search your house?
We're looking for--

20:28.812 --> 20:30.397
Stop! Stop, boy!

20:30.480 --> 20:31.607
Stop!

20:32.274 --> 20:33.442
Get on the floor!

20:44.578 --> 20:45.621
Show me your hands.

20:48.248 --> 20:51.084
You think you're slick?
Why were you running?

20:51.168 --> 20:54.004
No! What did I do wrong?

20:54.087 --> 20:55.672
You tell me what you did.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.701
Do you know who I am?

21:27.037 --> 21:29.289
My name is Colonel Horacio Carrillo.

21:30.290 --> 21:35.796
Last week...
30 police officers were murdered.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.215
Those pigs probably deserved it.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.221
Many of them were my friends.

21:45.222 --> 21:50.811
A person perched on rooftops,
guiding murderers with radios...

21:51.478 --> 21:53.647
are assassins themselves.

21:53.730 --> 21:58.151
I hope after this encounter,
you'll reconsider

21:58.235 --> 22:04.574
working with someone
who thinks he's above the law.

22:08.245 --> 22:11.999
What? Am I supposed to
shit in my pants in fear?

22:13.667 --> 22:15.043
No.

22:21.258 --> 22:22.843
Do I make myself clear?

22:22.926 --> 22:24.594
I want you to tell your friends,

22:24.720 --> 22:28.098
that this is what happens
when you work for Pablo Escobar!

22:51.121 --> 22:52.247
Take it.

22:53.457 --> 22:54.708
Take it.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.217
Tell them this is for Pablo.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.141
Remember what you saw.

23:13.477 --> 23:17.564
And know what will happen to you
if I see you on a rooftop.

23:17.647 --> 23:19.399
You can leave.

23:20.984 --> 23:22.319
Leave!

23:42.172 --> 23:46.176
So, what book shall we read
before bed tonight?

23:46.301 --> 23:47.844
<i>The Witch.</i>

23:47.969 --> 23:49.679
No, my love. No scary stories.

23:49.763 --> 23:52.349
<i>The Witch?</i> What's that? I don't know it.

23:52.432 --> 23:55.018
Dad reads it to us. Right, Dad?

23:55.102 --> 23:58.355
- The bad witch and the good witch, right?
- Yes.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.357
Not <i>The Witch,</i> Pablo.

24:00.482 --> 24:03.360
I don't want any more scary stories
in this house.

24:08.615 --> 24:11.451
Love, take your sister
and brush your teeth.

24:11.535 --> 24:13.286
And go straight to bed.

24:15.372 --> 24:18.125
Listen, where's my kiss?

24:18.875 --> 24:20.293
Good night.

24:20.836 --> 24:24.381
- Good night, my love.
- Straight to bed, Manuela, please.

24:41.898 --> 24:44.192
I heard a scary story, Pablo.

24:45.902 --> 24:48.572
The man who killed Gustavo
is back in Medellín.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.158
Is that story true?

24:53.243 --> 24:54.494
Yes.

24:58.165 --> 25:02.002
Does that sound like the government
is trying to negotiate?

25:06.256 --> 25:07.549
Good night.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.608
Someone has to tell you
how things are, Pablo.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.863
That man is here to kill you.

26:02.479 --> 26:04.397
I'm scared, Pablo.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.779
I promise you one thing:

26:11.780 --> 26:15.617
if things get out of hand
and I can't control it...

26:16.576 --> 26:18.245
we'll leave the country.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.124
Okay?

27:24.728 --> 27:27.856
- Have you seen this woman?
- No.

27:29.149 --> 27:31.234
She works at the market.

27:32.902 --> 27:34.195
Sweetheart?

27:38.366 --> 27:39.909
- Are you sure?
- No.

27:50.587 --> 27:52.589
Nobody's seen the bitch.

27:53.423 --> 27:54.841
I'm pissed off, brother.

28:03.391 --> 28:05.852
Let's go for some ice cream.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.187
Something cold.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.839
You were different this time, Javi.

29:21.428 --> 29:25.348
I always know when my clients
are trying to forget something.

29:29.269 --> 29:31.354
You know what I do to relax?

29:33.606 --> 29:36.025
- I write.
- You write?

29:38.945 --> 29:41.698
- What do you write?
- Letters.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.867
For my family, but I never send them.

29:45.326 --> 29:46.953
It's good to forget.

30:00.717 --> 30:02.886
What do you want to forget?

30:09.058 --> 30:10.852
Why don't you stop?

30:14.564 --> 30:16.149
Why don't you?

30:39.589 --> 30:41.925
Welcome, brother.

30:43.426 --> 30:44.761
This way.

30:56.606 --> 30:58.608
- What is your name?
- David.

30:58.733 --> 31:03.196
- I'm Pablo. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you, too.

31:03.279 --> 31:04.531
Follow me.

31:07.367 --> 31:10.036
They told me you like soccer.

31:11.120 --> 31:14.374
- I play defense.
- Of course.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.293
Those are the real men.

31:21.214 --> 31:23.132
You're very brave, David.

31:25.301 --> 31:27.136
I'm sorry for what you witnessed.

31:27.971 --> 31:31.057
The people we're fighting
are very bad people.

31:31.140 --> 31:33.810
Tell me about the man who did that.

31:37.647 --> 31:39.566
He said this bullet is for you.

31:52.912 --> 31:55.665
I need you to do one last favor for me.

31:57.584 --> 31:59.669
It's very important.

32:00.837 --> 32:02.297
You think you can do it?

32:08.845 --> 32:10.513
Thank you, David.

32:17.145 --> 32:20.857
<i>Agent Peña. This is Don Berna.</i>

32:20.940 --> 32:24.027
<i>I have a proposition
you might be interested in.</i>

32:25.945 --> 32:27.697
What a surprise.

32:33.536 --> 32:36.122
What's up, Peña?
Are you expecting anyone else?

32:36.205 --> 32:38.875
No. Are you?

32:38.958 --> 32:41.377
No, it's not necessary.

32:41.461 --> 32:44.631
Everywhere I go in this town,
I'm surrounded by friends.

32:44.714 --> 32:48.718
Sit down. Sit so you can taste
the best coffee in Medellín.

32:48.843 --> 32:52.472
Doña Luz! Bring my friend a coffee.

32:53.640 --> 32:56.017
You have something
other than coffee for me?

32:58.186 --> 33:01.898
Look, Agent... I'm not one of those
street-corner informants

33:01.981 --> 33:05.068
that you slip a few gringo dollars
for a tip. No, sir.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.569
Then why are we here?

33:13.242 --> 33:16.746
Agent, you and I
are like the snake and the cat.

33:17.914 --> 33:21.000
If the snake has the chance,
it will kill the cat.

33:21.084 --> 33:24.337
And if the cat has the chance,
it will kill the snake.

33:25.546 --> 33:30.426
But there are times
when they see a big rat,

33:30.551 --> 33:32.887
and they both want to eat it.

35:25.041 --> 35:26.334
Gato!

35:27.835 --> 35:32.215
No! Calm down.
Okay, relax. Don't kill me--

35:33.382 --> 35:35.676
Relax!

35:39.347 --> 35:40.807
Detaining the prisoners.

35:46.229 --> 35:47.980
We captured about 45 of them.

36:44.787 --> 36:46.122
Approaching.

36:56.465 --> 36:58.217
We're locking you up.

36:58.301 --> 36:59.468
Move it!

37:48.017 --> 37:49.602
Hello, Valeria.

37:52.521 --> 37:57.443
- I didn't realize you'd be here.
- I wanted to be sure it went well.

37:57.526 --> 38:02.323
- People need to hear the truth, right?
- Yes, it's important.

38:03.199 --> 38:06.786
They forced this boy
to watch his friend get shot.

38:06.869 --> 38:10.623
When the country hears this story,
they'll turn on that son of a bitch

38:10.706 --> 38:13.209
who's murdering children
for the Americans.

38:14.710 --> 38:18.464
Well... that's what I hope.

38:21.050 --> 38:22.885
I'm glad you came.

38:24.553 --> 38:26.722
It's good to see you again.

38:35.856 --> 38:38.526
Are all eyes still on you?

38:40.861 --> 38:42.571
Except yours.

38:55.334 --> 38:56.752
Let's begin.

38:58.587 --> 39:00.172
Yes.

39:00.256 --> 39:02.091
<i>- How old are you?
- Ten.</i>

39:03.050 --> 39:05.428
I understand you're quite a soccer player.

39:06.512 --> 39:09.390
Thank you for being brave enough
to tell us your story, David.

39:10.433 --> 39:14.020
Tell me, who were the men
who brought you to the building that day?

39:14.103 --> 39:16.022
They were Search Bloc policemen.

39:17.773 --> 39:19.692
<i>Do you know why they brought you there?</i>

39:19.775 --> 39:22.695
<i>He said they were going
to send a message to other kids.</i>

39:22.778 --> 39:25.281
<i>Who is "he"? Do you remember his name?</i>

39:25.364 --> 39:27.283
<i>Colonel Carrillo.</i>

39:27.408 --> 39:29.285
Relax, gentlemen, everything's fine.

39:30.119 --> 39:32.788
- Where are you taking us?
- Bogotá.

39:34.540 --> 39:37.460
You're going to jail
until this gets resolved.

39:37.585 --> 39:41.922
But look...
if you help me, I can help you.

39:42.965 --> 39:47.636
Give me Pablo, or Blackie or someone else,
then I'll help you.

39:47.762 --> 39:50.389
I don't know where they are.
I don't know them.

39:50.473 --> 39:53.392
- So you don't know anything?
- No, sir.

39:56.729 --> 39:57.772
What about you, Gato?

40:02.068 --> 40:03.319
All right.

40:04.737 --> 40:06.781
If it's going to be like this...

40:13.996 --> 40:16.499
<i>Who else was there
besides Colonel Carrillo?</i>

40:16.624 --> 40:17.750
<i>A bunch of men.</i>

40:17.833 --> 40:22.838
Some I heard speaking English.
Americans. Like in the movies.

40:22.922 --> 40:24.965
Are you sure they were police?

40:26.008 --> 40:27.676
Yes.

40:27.802 --> 40:29.178
What now?

40:31.013 --> 40:34.016
You think Pablo is going to reward you
for being brave?

40:34.683 --> 40:37.520
Asshole, he doesn't even know you exist.
Do you know that?

40:38.521 --> 40:40.689
It's your last chance, Gato.

40:40.815 --> 40:43.359
Ask your mother, you son of bitch!

41:46.255 --> 41:48.174
- Hello.
<i>- Everything is good.</i>

41:48.757 --> 41:51.343
- It worked.
<i>- Very well.</i>

41:53.846 --> 41:54.889
It worked.

41:57.516 --> 42:01.437
- They took my lab.
- And a bunch of Escobar's men.

42:01.562 --> 42:04.440
It's for a noble cause, Mrs. Moncada.

42:09.528 --> 42:11.530
Boss, forgive me, but there's bad news.

42:12.615 --> 42:16.368
Search Bloc took down the Moncadas'
biggest lab before we could take it apart.

42:16.452 --> 42:20.956
Carrillo got Gato. We don't know where
they are or what they're doing to him.
