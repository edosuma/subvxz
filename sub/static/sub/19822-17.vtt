WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.301
You tell him. No, please tell him.

00:02.370 --> 00:03.802
No, you tell him. Oh, come on.

00:03.871 --> 00:05.371
I don't wanna tell him, you have to...

00:06.974 --> 00:07.906
(Sal) Guys!

00:07.975 --> 00:10.342
We don't think this
is such a good idea.

00:10.411 --> 00:12.144
Detaining a person against their will

00:12.213 --> 00:13.946
is awfully close to kidnapping.

00:14.015 --> 00:15.214
Okay, she broke into our house.

00:15.282 --> 00:16.515
We have the right to defend ourselves.

00:16.584 --> 00:17.649
Yeah, but we're not exactly

00:17.718 --> 00:19.485
defending ourselves anymore.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.321
Look, we're not
kidnapping anybody, okay?

00:22.390 --> 00:26.392
Look at it as a, uh...
citizen's arrest.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.761
A citizen's arrest? What's that?

00:28.829 --> 00:32.430
A citizen's arrest is
when anybody, at all,

00:32.500 --> 00:34.433
arrests somebody for breaking the law.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.202
Can't believe you don't know that.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.971
Do you watch, like, zero television?

00:39.040 --> 00:40.172
(knocking on door)

00:40.241 --> 00:42.207
Hello?

00:42.276 --> 00:44.576
My name is Daniel Hunter.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.712
I'm going to open the door now.

00:48.616 --> 00:49.882
I need you to stay calm.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.551
Don't try any funny business, okay?

00:52.620 --> 00:54.553
(banging)

00:57.124 --> 00:58.857
We're not gonna hurt you.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.360
We just wanna talk.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.128
Okay?

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.673 --> 01:14.106
What's your name?

01:16.177 --> 01:18.110
(record scratching) This
is a citizen's arrest!

01:18.179 --> 01:19.244
A what arrest?

01:19.313 --> 01:20.479
Citizen's arrest. It's when some...

01:20.548 --> 01:21.947
Never mind! Okay, just...

01:25.386 --> 01:26.552
You guys should know that you're way

01:26.620 --> 01:28.187
in over your heads here.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.321
If you let me go, this problem

01:29.390 --> 01:31.990
doesn't have to get any bigger for you.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.192
(Sal) Yep, sounds reasonable!

01:33.260 --> 01:34.393
Help me with the ropes.

01:34.462 --> 01:35.561
Nobody's going anywhere

01:35.629 --> 01:37.629
until you tell us what
you're doing here.

01:37.698 --> 01:38.997
Who are you?

01:39.066 --> 01:40.933
Are you working for Saganash?

01:41.001 --> 01:42.868
We have ways of making
you talk, you know.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.038
How's she supposed to talk

01:46.107 --> 01:48.173
if you taped her mouth closed, genius?

01:48.242 --> 01:50.209
I once heard about a guy
who accidentally glued

01:50.277 --> 01:51.577
his mouth shut with über glue.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.645
Now he has to eat through
a tube in his nose.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.081
(loud ripping) Ow!

01:56.150 --> 01:57.683
Be careful!

01:59.286 --> 02:00.486
We don't want to hurt you.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.087
We're polite to all our guests.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.590
That's the way we were raised.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.392
She's not exactly a guest.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.561
She's a visitor. Same thing.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.463
Wow, Nika, why don't you
offer her tea and cake

02:11.532 --> 02:13.098
while you're at it? Good idea!

02:13.167 --> 02:14.099
No, no, no, no, don't...

02:16.170 --> 02:17.169
This is a mistake, okay?

02:17.238 --> 02:18.337
We shouldn't give her anything...

02:18.405 --> 02:20.005
nothing, no food... until she talks.

02:20.074 --> 02:21.473
If she's anything like
you, she'll be singing

02:21.542 --> 02:23.509
like a bird in under an hour.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.244
Yeah, can you imagine
an hour without food?

02:25.312 --> 02:27.546
I think feeding her's the right move.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.780
Studies have shown

02:28.849 --> 02:30.415
that police get more confessions

02:30.484 --> 02:32.017
when they treat suspects well,

02:32.086 --> 02:34.520
as opposed to treating
them like criminals.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.655
Guys, maybe this is all
a misunderstanding.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.558
I mean, how do we even know
she works for Saganash?

02:39.627 --> 02:41.960
She seems too... sweet.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.762
Try not to drool on your shoes.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.564
And cute...

02:45.633 --> 02:46.732
when she smiles...

02:46.800 --> 02:49.268
Yeah, she was smiling
at you, wasn't she?

02:49.336 --> 02:52.437
You noticed it, too? I
wasn't imagining it!

02:52.506 --> 02:54.406
Do you think she likes me?

02:54.475 --> 02:57.209
Eh... dude! She is a criminal!

02:57.278 --> 02:59.211
Wake up. She broke into our house!

03:02.116 --> 03:03.849
Why haven't we called the police?

03:03.918 --> 03:05.817
Keeping her prisoner is illegal.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.953
I don't wanna go to prison.
School's bad enough.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.154
Nobody's going to prison!

03:09.223 --> 03:10.856
We just need to figure
out what she knows.

03:10.925 --> 03:13.091
(Sal) How? She won't tell us anything.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.360
Oh, I know!

03:15.429 --> 03:17.696
Good cop/bad cop. Works every time.

03:17.765 --> 03:18.830
Works where?

03:18.899 --> 03:21.800
Um, I dunno... only every
detective movie ever!

03:21.869 --> 03:24.670
Sal, you be the good cop,
I'll be the bad cop.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.938
Wait, why can't I be the good cop?

03:26.006 --> 03:27.573
Do I really need to answer that?

03:28.776 --> 03:30.442
Well, w-what do I have to do?

03:30.511 --> 03:31.543
It's easy.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.478
So you will be the good cop,

03:33.547 --> 03:35.013
and you'll be really nice to her.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.816
I'll be the bad cop, and
I'll be a real jerk.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.185
The suspect feels like
you're on her side,

03:40.254 --> 03:41.587
and she'll form a bond with you.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.689
Eventually, she'll tell you everything.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.159
♪♪

04:00.341 --> 04:02.307
The way you broke into our house

04:02.376 --> 04:04.943
is really... impressive.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.946
Very professional. I wish

04:08.015 --> 04:09.581
I could do stuff like that.

04:12.553 --> 04:15.320
And, um, your coat!

04:15.389 --> 04:17.856
It's very functional.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.291
And you have a great smile!

04:20.928 --> 04:22.561
Your coat smells like cheese.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.463
And your feet are way
too big for your body.

04:24.531 --> 04:25.897
Now start talking, or
I'll bring the duct tape,

04:25.966 --> 04:27.332
and this time...

04:27.401 --> 04:29.501
some might get stuck in your hair.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.737
No! Not my hair!

04:31.805 --> 04:33.639
Stop it! We're not monsters!

04:33.707 --> 04:35.540
Sorry about him.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.209
He's always been sort of a jerk.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.210
Bah!

04:39.747 --> 04:40.912
So...

04:40.981 --> 04:44.283
would you be so kind
to please tell me, uh,

04:44.351 --> 04:46.585
what your name is? Please.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.788
Sophie.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.892
And, uh, Sophie...

04:53.961 --> 04:56.128
why did you break into our house?

04:59.133 --> 05:00.599
Tell us why!

05:00.668 --> 05:02.934
(laughing)

05:03.003 --> 05:03.935
What's so funny?

05:04.004 --> 05:06.738
Good cop/bad cop. Really?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.508
You think I've never seen
a detective movie before?

05:09.576 --> 05:13.478
You're gonna have to try a
lot harder than that, Max.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.546
You too, Sal.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.316
How do you know our names?

05:17.384 --> 05:19.017
I know more than you think,

05:19.086 --> 05:20.952
and you can do whatever you want to me,

05:21.021 --> 05:22.321
I'm not telling you anything.

05:22.389 --> 05:25.557
So, either call the cops or let me go.

05:27.461 --> 05:30.162
So how'd it go?

05:30.230 --> 05:31.296
Good.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.664
Well, what did she tell you?

05:32.733 --> 05:33.832
Her name is Sophie.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.401
Sophie?

05:36.470 --> 05:39.071
Sophie... Hunter.

05:39.139 --> 05:42.441
Mrs. Daniel... Hunter.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.643
Okay, well, what else?

05:44.712 --> 05:47.312
Oh, just... this and that, really.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.915
What kind of this and that?

05:49.983 --> 05:51.950
Nothing, okay? She
didn't tell us anything.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.786
There, I said it. I'm
a lousy detective.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.488
Happy? I am!

05:56.557 --> 05:57.856
The pressure was killing me.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.525
Maybe I should try.
She likes me, right?

06:00.594 --> 06:01.626
(all) No!

06:02.930 --> 06:05.030
Maybe we should just
give her more food.

06:05.099 --> 06:06.398
I'll go see if she likes goulash.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.100
Hey, n-no more food!

06:12.306 --> 06:13.839
Oh, no.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.174
What do we do?

06:16.243 --> 06:17.175
Think somebody better let them in.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.210
(Sal) Yeah.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.612
(Tim) Open the door. Yeah.

06:20.681 --> 06:21.813
Hey. Hey!

06:21.882 --> 06:23.548
Here we are. 7:00 on the dot.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.050
What about 7:00 on the dot?

06:25.119 --> 06:27.552
You invited us for dinner. Remember?

06:27.621 --> 06:29.988
Of course I remember!

06:30.057 --> 06:31.656
Hey, welcome, welcome.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.325
Hey, guys.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.193
Why did you say "Oh,
no" when you saw us?

06:35.262 --> 06:36.261
Wait, you heard that?

06:36.330 --> 06:37.629
Lip reader.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.565
I didn't say "Oh, no." I said...

06:41.735 --> 06:43.535
Fro yo.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.070
Frozen yogurt.

06:45.139 --> 06:46.938
It's what's for dessert.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.374
Think again. We brought an apple pie.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.309
Oh, ooh. Yummy!

06:52.479 --> 06:53.945
Hi.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.580
Max doesn't want to
give you any more food,

06:55.649 --> 06:56.948
but I think that's mean.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.884
Daniel's making goulash.
Do you like that?

06:58.952 --> 07:00.051
I like goulash.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.820
So do you want it with
meat or vegetarian?

07:01.889 --> 07:04.523
Goulash without meat isn't
really goulash, right?

07:04.591 --> 07:05.924
I know what you mean.

07:05.993 --> 07:06.958
I'm a vegetarian

07:07.027 --> 07:08.460
because I feel sad for all the animals,

07:08.529 --> 07:10.996
but when I'm eating goulash, I'm not.

07:11.064 --> 07:14.666
'Cause without the meat, I
just feel sad for myself.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.334
Does that make me a hypnotist?

07:16.403 --> 07:18.036
I think you mean a hypocrite.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.473
And no, it just means you like goulash.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.075
One meat goulash coming up, then.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.078
Bye.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.553
Oh, no.

07:34.621 --> 07:38.190
This time I distinctly heard
"Oh, no," and not "fro yo."

07:38.258 --> 07:40.725
Oh, sh-she said "Oh, no" because, um...

07:40.794 --> 07:42.527
she, uh, saw the apple pie.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.563
And she's... she really
loves apple pie,

07:44.631 --> 07:46.198
but she's not supposed to have it

07:46.266 --> 07:48.900
because she's allergic...

07:48.969 --> 07:50.469
to... to nutmeg.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.103
No, I'm... Poor Anika.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.272
Maybe we have some ice cream for you.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.509
Simone brought pie because
they're here for dinner.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.878
Oh, great!

08:01.682 --> 08:04.616
So... how are you guys doing?

08:04.685 --> 08:05.884
Anything going on?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.721
Nah, it's just a boring day.

08:09.790 --> 08:14.159
No burglars or kidnapping or anything.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.496
(chuckles)

08:17.564 --> 08:19.030
(all laughing)

08:19.099 --> 08:20.298
(Anika) It was a joke.

08:20.367 --> 08:23.001
(laughing continues)

08:23.070 --> 08:24.469
Crazy. (Anika) It's a joke.

08:24.538 --> 08:27.072
(laughing continues)

08:27.140 --> 08:30.609
(chattering)

08:30.677 --> 08:33.745
For you, and...

08:33.813 --> 08:36.648
another for you.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.650
(whispering) She wants hers with meat.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.385
Okay, thanks.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.988
I think I'll go, uh, eat in my room.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.188
In your room?

08:44.258 --> 08:46.157
Why? Yeah...

08:46.226 --> 08:47.425
(coughing) I should have told you.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.595
I, uh... (coughing)

08:50.664 --> 08:53.431
(hoarse) ...have strep throat.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.000
I, uh, don't wanna infect you.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.172
(coughing)

09:07.214 --> 09:09.948
Isn't strep throat really contagious?

09:10.017 --> 09:11.583
I think it is.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.052
Do you think he infected the goulash?

09:16.356 --> 09:19.157
Actually, strep is no longer contagious

09:19.226 --> 09:20.592
if you start taking antibiotics,

09:20.661 --> 09:22.360
which Daniel is, so...

09:22.429 --> 09:25.263
And luckily he still has his appetite.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.866
Two plates of goulash. Ooh.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.401
Must be really good goulash then.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.974
I brought you some goulash.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.742
With meat. Oh, thanks.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.979
Are you okay? Um... are
the ropes too tight?

09:41.048 --> 09:42.881
Well, I'm a lot better, actually,

09:42.950 --> 09:44.249
now that you're here.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.752
That smells really good.

09:47.821 --> 09:48.887
Enjoy.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.790
Oh, Daniel?

09:51.858 --> 09:56.194
It's kind of impossible to
eat with my arms tied up.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.496
Do you think you could feed me?

09:58.565 --> 10:00.265
Yeah, yeah, sure.

10:00.334 --> 10:02.233
(silverware clanking)

10:04.705 --> 10:06.137
Here you go.

10:08.342 --> 10:09.908
Oh, no. What?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.142
I was just thinking,

10:11.211 --> 10:14.312
if you have to feed me,
then you can't eat yours.

10:14.381 --> 10:17.549
It'll get cold, and who
likes cold goulash?

10:17.618 --> 10:20.318
Yeah, that's gross. Um...

10:20.387 --> 10:23.622
If you untie me, then
we could eat together.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.795
What? I won't run away.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.665
Plus, you're way stronger than I am.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.507
Thank you.

10:42.576 --> 10:44.075
(shivering)

10:44.144 --> 10:45.276
Are you okay?

10:45.345 --> 10:47.779
I'm fine, it's... it's just a bit cold.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.814
Oh, I'll... I'll turn up the heat.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.383
No, that's okay.

10:51.451 --> 10:54.586
Do you have a blanket,
maybe, or something?

10:54.655 --> 10:55.587
Yeah, of course.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.022
Yeah, be right back. Okay.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.893

11:03.363 --> 11:04.396
(silverware clanking)

11:07.901 --> 11:08.967
What was that?

11:11.538 --> 11:13.038
(door creaking)

11:16.576 --> 11:17.575
I'll go check it out.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.210
I'll come with you.

11:24.418 --> 11:25.450

11:29.089 --> 11:30.889
See? Nothing. Right?

11:35.796 --> 11:37.762
What happened here?

11:37.831 --> 11:38.897
Little accident?

11:38.965 --> 11:40.532
Um...

11:40.600 --> 11:41.966
Oh, I guess playing baseball

11:42.035 --> 11:43.168
in a house that's also a museum

11:43.236 --> 11:45.070
is not the best idea in the world.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.905

11:49.009 --> 11:51.443
Hi. Are you okay?

11:57.984 --> 11:59.150
Uh...

11:59.219 --> 12:02.320
I, uh... I think he's sleepwalking.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.555
Um...

12:06.393 --> 12:07.859
Daniel?

12:07.928 --> 12:09.661
This is Max.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.362
You need to go to bed.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.298
Right now.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.133
D-d-do you hear me?

12:15.202 --> 12:20.004
You need to turn around and go to bed

12:20.073 --> 12:22.006
where it's warm and it's nice.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.742
There you go. That's good.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.948
I guess having strep throat
can make you a little...

12:30.016 --> 12:32.250
a little delirious.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.452
Right.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.421
Come on. Let's finish eating.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.056
Come on.

12:39.559 --> 12:40.759
(nervous chuckling)

12:46.833 --> 12:48.333

12:48.401 --> 12:50.702
I know, I love goulash.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.804
I'm a vegetarian, but not
when I'm eating goulash.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.439
'Cause I don't really
like it without the meat.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.441
Sophie says that goulash

12:56.510 --> 12:58.143
isn't really goulash without the...

12:59.980 --> 13:00.979
Who's Sophie?

13:02.516 --> 13:03.848
Her new friend from school.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.350
Right, Nika? Right.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.252
(Anika) It was her first day today.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.853
She's really nice and
she has long hair...

13:08.922 --> 13:10.922
I thought you were on
a break from school.

13:12.225 --> 13:15.193
She had a holiday
make-up day at school.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.495
Yeah, it's for kids who
miss school too much.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.297
(Tess) Yeah. Like Nika.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.698
I missed school too,

13:20.767 --> 13:21.933
but I didn't get a make-up day.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.136
They don't let you go
if you get all "A's."

13:25.205 --> 13:27.005
Too bad, Sal.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.274
Yeah, really is.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.576
Ooh, well, speaking of breaks

13:31.645 --> 13:33.478
I could use a bathroom break.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.321
(Sophie) I think you're the
coolest one in your family.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.857
That was easy to see.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.193
Thanks.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.830
So, what do you like to
do in your free time?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.266
You know, the usual stuff.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.534
Hang out with friends,
play video games...

13:56.603 --> 13:58.469
(door opening)

13:58.538 --> 13:59.470
Dude! (record scratching)

14:01.107 --> 14:02.974
Why did you untie her?

14:03.043 --> 14:04.142
She had to eat.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.277
What is...

14:06.346 --> 14:07.278
Come on!

14:07.347 --> 14:09.080
You gotta go to bed. Come on.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.182
You're supposed to be
sick, remember? Why?

14:11.251 --> 14:12.517
Let's find out.

14:15.922 --> 14:18.289
Fun's over. Fun is over.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.561
Time to start talking.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.931
How's it going?

14:30.070 --> 14:31.269
You get anything out of her yet?

14:31.338 --> 14:32.470
Nada.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.005
(Max) She's one tough nut to crack.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.773
Well, I don't think I'd
talk to you either

14:35.842 --> 14:37.041
if you tied me to a chair.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.145
What? Are you on her side right now?

14:41.214 --> 14:42.647
Could you give us a minute?

14:42.716 --> 14:44.082
Give you a minute?

14:44.150 --> 14:45.149
If you're gonna let her go...

14:45.218 --> 14:46.351

(Tim) There you go.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.564
Hey.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.733
What happened to you?

15:01.801 --> 15:02.967
Did you get locked in the bathroom?

15:03.036 --> 15:04.869
Yes. Yes. Uh...

15:04.938 --> 15:07.672
the doorknob actually
fell off into my hand.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.274
Yeah, lucky I got out.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.575
And where did Tess go?

15:12.479 --> 15:16.381
Oh, um, she wasn't feeling great.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.382
Think she's coming
down with a little...

15:17.450 --> 15:18.583
Strep throat? Yeah.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.551
Mm-hmm. Good try,

15:20.620 --> 15:22.153
but I'm not buying it.

15:22.222 --> 15:25.189
Why don't you just tell
me what's going on?

15:26.826 --> 15:29.928
Nobody's talking? Fine.

15:29.996 --> 15:32.196
Then I'll just have
to go see for myself.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.172
(knocking on door)

15:41.241 --> 15:42.340

15:46.680 --> 15:47.845
How are you feeling?

15:47.914 --> 15:49.647
(hoarse) Bad.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.883
Really, really bad.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.251
It hurts to talk.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.053
Really? Or are you faking?

15:55.121 --> 15:56.254
(normal) Excuse me?

15:57.557 --> 15:59.390
Isn't one of the symptoms

15:59.459 --> 16:02.460
of a strep throat a high fever?

16:05.432 --> 16:06.731
I, uh, I...

16:06.800 --> 16:09.067
Why don't we see how
sick you really are?

16:13.340 --> 16:14.439
If there's anything
you want to tell me,

16:14.507 --> 16:15.807
now would be a good time.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.042

Oh, for crying out loud, Tim!

you need another piece of apple pie,

Okay, thanks!

So, let's see what you got, Mr. Strep.

you to a hospital.

Wait... What's going on?

20:49.849 --> 20:50.781
Sophie's gone!

20:50.850 --> 20:51.882
What do you mean she's gone?

20:51.951 --> 20:52.950
Where did she go? The door was locked.

20:53.019 --> 20:53.951
I have no idea!

20:54.020 --> 20:55.753
You let her out, didn't you?

20:55.822 --> 20:57.388
I did not!

20:57.457 --> 20:58.389
You did! Didn't you?

20:58.458 --> 21:00.558
I was sick in bed.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.660
I-I mean, I was in bed.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.030
You did, didn't you?

21:06.099 --> 21:08.065
You were afraid we'd get put in jail.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.400
Admit it!

21:09.469 --> 21:10.501
Definitely.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.604
But I'm also afraid of
everybody being ma...

21:21.581 --> 21:24.482
I felt sorry for her.

21:24.550 --> 21:27.251
She missed her dad. I
know what that's like.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.889
Sorry. Are you mad?

21:33.426 --> 21:35.593
No, we're not mad at you, Anika.

21:39.165 --> 21:40.831
How could you do that?

21:40.900 --> 21:42.800
Now we'll never find
out about the truth.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.403
Maybe we will. Maybe
there's some other way.

21:47.373 --> 21:48.539
(doorbell ringing)

21:48.608 --> 21:49.940
I'll get it.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.283
I'll tell you everything I know.
