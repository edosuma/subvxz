WEBVTT

00:00.840 --> 00:02.468
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.492 --> 00:05.076
The name Sebastien
Valet has been forgotten.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.635
They took him and I
couldn't do anything.

00:06.659 --> 00:07.535
We can find him.

00:07.591 --> 00:10.578
True evil only comes by corrupting

00:10.606 --> 00:13.571
- something truly good.
- Mason!

00:15.401 --> 00:16.681
Who the hell was that?

00:17.051 --> 00:18.631
Sebastien Valet.

00:41.492 --> 00:43.164
You knew, didn't you?

00:43.526 --> 00:46.575
I wasn't certain, but I suspected.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.906
Although, it makes sense
that Marie-Jeanne's pike

00:49.930 --> 00:52.949
would be reforged into
something that could appear

00:52.973 --> 00:55.008
as innocuous as a cane.

00:56.871 --> 00:58.458
But will it kill him?

00:59.851 --> 01:01.459
You're damn right it will.

01:03.552 --> 01:05.946
Vanishing twin syndrome...

01:06.519 --> 01:08.261
This is part of your expertise, right?

01:08.846 --> 01:10.712
Not particularly, no.

01:16.063 --> 01:17.415
He's still alive.

01:33.854 --> 01:35.739
This looks bad, Theo.

01:37.773 --> 01:39.037
I'll be fine.

02:16.659 --> 02:18.775
Maybe we need to stop.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.812
Or figure out another plan.

02:20.836 --> 02:23.049
Just take a couple more
days to think about it.

02:23.734 --> 02:26.934
Days? You want to wait days?

02:27.152 --> 02:29.502
You're hurt. You need time to heal.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.535
And I'm not like the others.

02:32.655 --> 02:34.344
I can't take your pain.

02:35.621 --> 02:37.160
I know,

02:37.629 --> 02:39.162
and that's okay.

02:40.146 --> 02:42.549
Because you can do
something else for me.

02:45.111 --> 02:46.712
You can give me your power.

02:52.037 --> 02:53.135
Theo...

02:59.854 --> 03:01.711
Theo, stop...

03:31.641 --> 03:33.722
And then there were none.

05:18.847 --> 05:21.075
Who are you calling, Malia?

05:21.718 --> 05:24.172
Is it Stiles, your boyfriend?

05:28.122 --> 05:30.089
Tell him to come.

05:30.402 --> 05:32.664
Bring all your friends, if you want.

05:34.729 --> 05:36.737
Go ahead, Malia.

05:37.112 --> 05:42.139
You tell me how many people
I'm gonna have to kill tonight.

05:53.340 --> 05:55.059
Can you keep him alive?

05:55.094 --> 05:57.050
I'm not sure he technically is alive.

05:57.074 --> 05:59.951
Screw keeping him alive.
How do we get him to talk?

06:00.071 --> 06:02.729
Personally, I don't think we
utilize torture nearly enough.

06:03.092 --> 06:04.677
Come...

06:06.094 --> 06:07.505
Did you hear that?

06:08.615 --> 06:11.031
Come to me...

06:11.841 --> 06:13.202
To me.

06:28.874 --> 06:30.473
Liam, wait!

06:56.485 --> 06:57.952
Stop.

07:01.143 --> 07:02.734
It's electrified.

07:26.230 --> 07:28.067
Marcel...

07:29.628 --> 07:32.639
If this is what immortality looks like,

07:34.057 --> 07:36.563
I think you might have been misled.

07:37.616 --> 07:40.126
For you...

07:42.350 --> 07:44.395
All for you...

07:45.831 --> 07:48.460
What did you do with it, Marcel?

07:48.949 --> 07:52.381
Where is the pike?

07:53.110 --> 07:55.050
The Argents...

07:56.818 --> 08:00.037
The Argents...

08:01.764 --> 08:03.322
The cane.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.602
But they took it.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.856
They took the cane.

08:24.061 --> 08:25.722
I lost him.

08:25.842 --> 08:27.696
Sebastien's going to
know we have the pike.

08:27.722 --> 08:30.133
And if he doesn't, he's going
to figure it out soon enough.

08:30.742 --> 08:32.456
Then what do we do?

08:32.788 --> 08:34.770
We stop chasing him.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.724
And make him come to us.

08:50.805 --> 08:52.431
Almost, Braeden.

08:52.752 --> 08:54.455
But not quite.

08:55.309 --> 08:56.955
You'll get another chance.

08:57.075 --> 08:59.559
But you better make
sure it's a head shot.

09:09.823 --> 09:11.489
Coming down, Malia?

09:12.348 --> 09:14.051
Malia, don't move!

09:18.890 --> 09:20.223
Maybe there's something in here.

09:20.247 --> 09:22.170
Something about how he
was a Genetic Chimera.

09:22.194 --> 09:23.938
Mason had a vanishing twin.

09:23.962 --> 09:25.560
Now we've got a vanishing Mason.

09:25.645 --> 09:28.699
What does that have to do with him
turning into a 250-year-old French guy?

09:28.723 --> 09:30.143
- How does that even happen?
- Hold on,

09:30.167 --> 09:31.881
Scott might have something.

09:33.017 --> 09:35.279
Mason's twin wasn't entirely gone.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.630
That's what made him a Genetic Chimera.

09:38.970 --> 09:40.521
The DNA was still there.

09:40.568 --> 09:42.896
Metaphorically speaking,
the DNA of Mason

09:42.920 --> 09:44.875
could still be inside Sebastien as well.

09:45.277 --> 09:46.472
How?

09:46.802 --> 09:48.779
Life is energy.

09:49.648 --> 09:51.725
Energy doesn't just disappear.

09:51.845 --> 09:55.144
The Dread Doctors may have found a way to
break the rules of the supernatural world

09:55.182 --> 09:57.718
but there are some rules
that simply won't break.

09:58.044 --> 09:59.640
So Mason can't just be gone?

09:59.776 --> 10:03.382
Somewhere in Sebastien he has
to still exist in some form.

10:03.813 --> 10:06.647
A spark of energy, a flicker of memory.

10:06.733 --> 10:07.811
Hang on...

10:08.451 --> 10:10.261
Liam, you said Mason said something

10:10.285 --> 10:11.406
right before he turned.

10:11.430 --> 10:13.530
He said, "That's not my name."

10:14.821 --> 10:16.429
He finally remembered his name.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.401
Damnatio Memoriae.

10:18.795 --> 10:20.456
That's what they wanted.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.970
They wanted Sebastien
to remember his name.

10:24.718 --> 10:27.094
Scott, you know the myth of what happens

10:27.118 --> 10:28.984
when you call a werewolf
by its given name?

10:30.006 --> 10:31.422
It turns back to human.

10:31.508 --> 10:32.872
What does that mean?

10:33.536 --> 10:35.195
Someone can just walk up to the Beast,

10:35.220 --> 10:37.100
yell Mason's name and turn him back?

10:37.220 --> 10:38.392
Not someone...

10:39.736 --> 10:41.026
Lydia.

10:42.065 --> 10:43.719
Who did you say you were looking for?

10:44.082 --> 10:45.852
The man's name is Argent.

10:46.402 --> 10:48.237
Did you say Argent?

10:49.618 --> 10:51.444
Sorry. My son likes to leave...

10:51.489 --> 10:54.627
incredibly long and
incredibly confusing messages.

10:56.621 --> 10:58.698
Maybe I should just
turn the damn thing...

11:06.537 --> 11:08.204
So...

11:10.500 --> 11:12.758
You're looking for one of the Argents?

11:18.769 --> 11:20.672
You seem to know who I am.

11:22.656 --> 11:26.353
That means you know what I'm capable of.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.524
I've got some experience.

11:29.863 --> 11:34.166
Your weapons may be more
sophisticated than the arrows

11:34.535 --> 11:36.624
and the bullets of my time,

11:37.671 --> 11:39.880
but they still won't kill me.

11:48.721 --> 11:51.049
I'm pretty sure a
nine millimeter Beretta

11:51.090 --> 11:54.779
will do more damage than
an 18th century musket.

11:59.450 --> 12:01.042
Are you certain?

12:03.695 --> 12:06.526
I can walk out of this
place with my hands clean.

12:07.565 --> 12:08.805
Or,

12:09.291 --> 12:12.793
I can walk out with
them drenched in blood.

12:18.759 --> 12:20.166
Your choice.

12:37.985 --> 12:39.113
Sir?

12:39.152 --> 12:40.666
Clark, don't.

12:42.868 --> 12:44.454
Stop where you are.

12:46.795 --> 12:48.772
Let him go.

12:49.370 --> 12:50.906
No!

13:34.548 --> 13:35.681
Hayden.

13:37.199 --> 13:38.800
Your name is Hayden.

13:58.216 --> 13:59.303
Melissa...

13:59.891 --> 14:01.206
Melissa!

14:03.976 --> 14:05.360
Malia. Come down.

14:05.411 --> 14:07.129
Don't listen to her.

14:10.175 --> 14:12.208
I'm not going to stop, Malia.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.732
I'm taking back what you stole from me.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.056
I didn't steal anything.

14:20.872 --> 14:22.514
But you did.

14:24.118 --> 14:27.475
And I don't care if you were
a willing participant or not.

14:28.682 --> 14:30.908
Talia Hale spent nine months

14:30.932 --> 14:34.412
trying to convince me of
the miracle of childbirth.

14:36.255 --> 14:38.472
You know what it really felt like?

14:40.728 --> 14:41.951
A parasite.

14:45.265 --> 14:47.801
Talia said it was a gift...

14:48.405 --> 14:52.990
That the coyote passes down part
of her power to her daughter.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.593
She called it beautiful.

14:58.044 --> 15:00.005
I call it theft.

15:32.369 --> 15:33.638
Where is it?

15:42.796 --> 15:44.731
I brought you here like you wanted.

15:44.798 --> 15:46.289
How about letting me go now?

16:04.220 --> 16:06.019
This demon, on the left.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.745
What is he?

16:09.649 --> 16:11.236
He's called a Hellhound.

16:18.217 --> 16:19.440
Parrish...

16:21.323 --> 16:23.384
His name is Parrish, isn't it?

16:24.044 --> 16:27.663
And the Argents will try to
put the pike in his hands.

16:36.148 --> 16:39.800
When did young people
become so confident?

17:00.032 --> 17:01.640
I know that sound.

17:02.383 --> 17:04.115
It's the Argents, isn't it?

17:04.160 --> 17:06.553
Drawing the Beast to
them. Corralling it.

17:06.577 --> 17:08.762
You'll need to be back at full capacity.

17:11.351 --> 17:12.599
Let's find out.

17:22.661 --> 17:24.191
Looks like it worked.

17:24.241 --> 17:26.252
You know, Theo,

17:26.372 --> 17:29.492
someday your willingness to stab

17:29.536 --> 17:31.774
anyone and everyone in the back

17:31.798 --> 17:34.697
might turn out to be your downfall.

17:37.033 --> 17:39.474
Don't worry. You can
still have Scott's eyes.

17:40.524 --> 17:42.608
I'll just be bringing them to you.

17:56.029 --> 17:57.118
Hey.

17:57.626 --> 17:58.799
You all right?

17:59.900 --> 18:01.291
Did...

18:01.721 --> 18:03.899
Did you find something?

18:05.173 --> 18:06.692
A solution?

18:08.222 --> 18:09.898
Yeah. It was you.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.428
It was you, Lydia.

18:36.011 --> 18:37.575
Lydia's been hurt.

18:37.625 --> 18:39.653
Badly.

18:41.139 --> 18:42.902
It doesn't change anything.

18:43.149 --> 18:44.467
What if she's dying?

18:45.192 --> 18:48.231
If we don't stop
Sebastien, she will die.

18:48.292 --> 18:49.928
He's not just coming for the pike.

18:50.048 --> 18:52.082
He's coming for anything
that stands in his way.

18:52.106 --> 18:54.396
Right now, that's all of us.

19:03.930 --> 19:05.483
What are you doing?

19:05.969 --> 19:07.885
You saved my life once.

19:08.387 --> 19:10.074
Now, I'm going to save yours.

19:15.610 --> 19:17.375
I'm not sure I'm getting
the strategy here.

19:17.436 --> 19:19.268
You're the strategy, Parrish.

19:19.313 --> 19:21.072
You're the one in the fresco.

19:21.192 --> 19:25.413
Put there as a reminder that
the Beast isn't unstoppable.

19:26.445 --> 19:27.784
Whoever painted it...

19:27.808 --> 19:30.886
They didn't see a guy with
a gun facing down the Beast.

19:31.991 --> 19:33.376
They saw you.

19:35.454 --> 19:37.482
They saw a Hellhound.

20:05.094 --> 20:06.350
Is she okay?

20:06.596 --> 20:08.382
She's gonna be fine, but...

20:08.406 --> 20:09.998
She can't really talk.

20:10.807 --> 20:12.354
Then it's over, isn't it?

20:18.461 --> 20:19.981
There's nothing we can do to save him.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.404
Give me a second.

20:33.748 --> 20:36.978
Hey, it's me. Oh, God, I
wish you just picked up.

20:37.002 --> 20:38.551
I hate leaving messages.

20:38.596 --> 20:40.562
I always ramble. I
always say stupid things

20:40.596 --> 20:42.409
and when I finally get to
the super important thing

20:42.433 --> 20:44.753
that I'm supposed to say, the
voice-mail cuts me off and...

20:50.915 --> 20:52.769
Me again.

20:53.417 --> 20:54.875
I have to leave.

20:54.903 --> 20:57.076
But I'm coming back to help. I promise.

20:57.316 --> 21:00.250
Because you're right, Scott.
If anyone's going to save Mason,

21:00.629 --> 21:01.903
it's you.

21:02.775 --> 21:04.994
It's us.

21:09.303 --> 21:10.398
Get up.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.638
Why?

21:11.758 --> 21:13.727
Because I've got an idea.

21:14.335 --> 21:16.413
And because this isn't over.

21:24.996 --> 21:26.989
Lydia, this is gonna have
to be just between us,

21:27.013 --> 21:28.530
since I can get fired for it.

21:28.554 --> 21:29.687
It's a cortisone shot.

21:29.711 --> 21:31.582
It's gonna bring the inflammation down.

21:36.414 --> 21:37.659
Not there.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.226
Oh, yeah, okay, I'm gonna need to leave.

21:42.254 --> 21:43.617
You're not going anywhere.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.716
Hold her hand.

21:45.951 --> 21:48.386
Okay, fine. I'm not leaving,
but I still might faint.

21:48.911 --> 21:51.642
Okay. Here we go.

21:57.294 --> 21:59.422
Okay, Lydia, this is
gonna hurt like a bitch.

22:07.939 --> 22:09.220
Okay. I'll get Malia.

22:09.254 --> 22:11.136
- Text me when you find Parrish.
- Hold on.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.928
- What is this?
- Something I've been working on for a while.

22:17.048 --> 22:18.658
Just make sure Malia gets it.

22:18.682 --> 22:21.273
- Is it plan B?
- It was plan A.

22:21.313 --> 22:22.698
Plan A never works.

22:23.298 --> 22:24.636
This one will.

22:24.898 --> 22:25.915
Okay.

22:30.422 --> 22:31.450
Hayden?

22:34.378 --> 22:37.154
They said that you can
help us when we get hurt.

22:38.282 --> 22:40.732
Well, I think I'm pretty hurt.

22:56.453 --> 22:58.592
He's not slowing down.

22:58.712 --> 23:01.553
Oh, he will. They both will.

23:20.362 --> 23:21.817
Oh, damn.

23:32.650 --> 23:34.060
Scott?

23:35.284 --> 23:36.702
You hear that?

23:37.227 --> 23:38.361
I heard that.

23:38.791 --> 23:40.322
Lydia, save your voice.

23:45.123 --> 23:47.284
Hey... Lydia, get out of the water!

23:51.422 --> 23:53.969
Sorry, Lydia.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.614
Feel that, Scott?

24:14.865 --> 24:16.501
Kanima venom.

24:18.362 --> 24:20.171
Just let it happen. Let it go.

24:24.091 --> 24:25.750
Let everything go.

24:28.451 --> 24:30.372
No!

25:04.123 --> 25:05.162
Stiles?

25:17.682 --> 25:18.925
You hear that?

25:22.343 --> 25:24.080
That's the sound of real power.

25:38.079 --> 25:40.576
Another arrogant youth.

25:40.766 --> 25:43.290
A contender to steal my name?

25:43.899 --> 25:46.301
You think you can take it from me?

25:47.564 --> 25:49.077
I just want your power.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.269
No!

26:28.389 --> 26:29.855
No!

26:40.534 --> 26:42.210
You lied to me.

26:43.299 --> 26:45.220
You and Scott...

26:46.166 --> 26:47.819
That's right, Theo.

26:49.305 --> 26:50.807
The whole time.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.734
It would've never worked.

26:59.690 --> 27:01.053
It could have worked.

27:02.265 --> 27:04.449
With Belasko's talons.

27:28.832 --> 27:30.593
You broke my neck.

27:31.907 --> 27:33.629
And good luck with that.

27:34.648 --> 27:36.629
There's an access grate
that leads to the sublevel.

27:36.653 --> 27:37.936
I think we can get to Lydia there.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.161
What about Mason?

27:39.281 --> 27:40.853
We can still save your friend.

27:40.972 --> 27:42.195
Let's go.

27:49.246 --> 27:50.967
This just isn't my day.

27:51.921 --> 27:55.272
This is a surprising alliance, Scott.

27:55.392 --> 27:56.973
You and Deucalion?

27:59.561 --> 28:04.734
How long have you been planning
this clever little double cross?

28:04.854 --> 28:07.451
About as long as he and I
have been planning this one.

28:09.254 --> 28:10.756
What are you doing?

28:10.841 --> 28:12.469
I knew when I brought you back,

28:12.493 --> 28:14.609
it would never be about saving lives.

28:15.875 --> 28:18.533
Only about immortalizing your own.

28:20.930 --> 28:22.142
Scott,

28:22.656 --> 28:23.656
go.

28:29.072 --> 28:30.458
Go, now!

29:18.052 --> 29:20.141
It's not the full moon, Malia.

29:21.039 --> 29:23.581
But you know what? It's close enough.

29:23.609 --> 29:24.860
Stop...

29:34.633 --> 29:36.258
Malia.

29:47.687 --> 29:50.193
I want my power back.

29:57.947 --> 30:00.276
I want my family back.

30:25.302 --> 30:26.429
Can someone please come and take this

30:26.453 --> 30:28.514
gigantic shard of glass
out of my chest? Please?

30:34.568 --> 30:35.641
Scott.

30:37.828 --> 30:39.420
I'll do it.

30:40.247 --> 30:41.247
Liam...

30:41.283 --> 30:42.915
It should be me.

30:43.637 --> 30:46.228
If you get me close enough, I'll do it.

30:47.267 --> 30:49.367
We're not killing your best friend.

30:49.585 --> 30:51.640
That belongs to me.

30:57.410 --> 30:59.097
It's a family heirloom.

31:00.957 --> 31:02.778
I'd like it back, please.

31:04.593 --> 31:07.129
It's all yours. Just give us Mason.

31:08.478 --> 31:10.932
Unfortunately, I would
not know where to begin.

31:12.732 --> 31:15.294
And while I've benefited
from his memories,

31:15.562 --> 31:18.097
I don't have much use for an alter ego.

31:26.980 --> 31:28.502
You want it?

31:30.517 --> 31:31.898
Come and get it.

31:50.374 --> 31:51.819
Sorry I'm late.

32:49.138 --> 32:51.264
You're strong. There's no doubt in that.

32:53.427 --> 32:56.432
But neither of you fight
with a killer instinct.

32:57.939 --> 33:00.212
Let me show you how
to go for the throat.

33:13.401 --> 33:15.216
Liam, wait.

33:15.255 --> 33:16.931
We can still save Mason.

33:17.355 --> 33:18.659
Who's going to save you?

33:18.687 --> 33:20.983
What kind of werewolves are you?

33:22.860 --> 33:24.022
No!

34:04.725 --> 34:05.974
Marie-Jeanne?

34:11.288 --> 34:12.947
Mason!

34:20.824 --> 34:22.991
I think you're gonna need
to try it a little louder.

34:32.407 --> 34:35.842
Mason!

35:19.255 --> 35:20.685
Scott!

35:22.146 --> 35:23.595
No!

35:47.398 --> 35:48.670
Is everyone okay?

35:48.862 --> 35:50.672
Not everyone.

36:04.918 --> 36:06.890
The Skinwalkers have a
message for you, Theo.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.397
Your sister wants to see you.

36:31.736 --> 36:33.143
Scott, help me!

36:33.171 --> 36:34.372
No! No!

36:34.492 --> 36:35.852
Scott! Help me, Scott!

36:35.885 --> 36:37.030
No! Scott!

36:37.089 --> 36:38.332
Help me!

37:00.152 --> 37:02.899
Hayden, I've managed
to stabilize the injury.

37:02.923 --> 37:04.559
But considering you're a Chimera,

37:04.588 --> 37:07.224
I don't know how, or if, you'll heal.

37:07.257 --> 37:09.458
We can still take you to the hospital.

37:09.726 --> 37:11.340
I've already died there once.

37:11.675 --> 37:13.178
It's your choice.

37:13.263 --> 37:14.423
I know.

37:50.429 --> 37:51.799
You saved their lives.

37:51.844 --> 37:53.552
Mason. Malia.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.848
Half the population of Beacon Hills.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.138
That's got to feel pretty good.

37:59.258 --> 38:00.998
It did. For a while.

38:03.461 --> 38:05.324
But it's something
you want to feel again.

38:05.444 --> 38:06.600
Yeah.

38:07.363 --> 38:09.203
Yeah, I think so.

38:09.940 --> 38:12.565
Welcome to your future
career in law enforcement.

38:45.854 --> 38:47.441
You don't have to do this.

38:49.028 --> 38:50.706
I made a deal with them.

38:51.736 --> 38:53.072
And I need to.

38:53.412 --> 38:55.168
It's not for my parents.

38:55.288 --> 38:56.548
It's not for you.

38:57.299 --> 38:58.438
It's for me.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.212
How long is it going to take?

39:01.834 --> 39:03.577
As long as it takes.

39:12.554 --> 39:14.140
Keep it for me.

39:14.842 --> 39:16.223
Keep it safe.

39:42.836 --> 39:45.111
But she'll be back. She
still has to graduate.

39:45.135 --> 39:46.735
That's the thing,
though, I don't know...

39:46.835 --> 39:48.032
When we started this school year,

39:48.056 --> 39:49.636
I was so stressed
about everyone ending up

39:49.660 --> 39:51.428
in the same place after we graduate.

39:51.548 --> 39:53.150
But I don't think it matters.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.920
You know? We always seem
to find each other anyway.

39:56.586 --> 39:57.890
Even Allison.

40:01.988 --> 40:03.181
He didn't tell you.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.451
It was in the tunnels...

40:06.568 --> 40:08.789
When Sebastien had his
hands around Scott's throat.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.158
The guy probably didn't
even know what he was doing.

40:14.163 --> 40:16.000
His claws got into Scott's neck.

40:17.135 --> 40:18.940
He was going to kill him,

40:19.835 --> 40:21.398
but then he stopped

40:25.549 --> 40:26.689
and he said a name...

40:27.099 --> 40:28.221
Marie-Jeanne.

40:29.964 --> 40:31.484
He saw Scott's memories.

40:31.570 --> 40:33.015
He saw Allison.

40:35.073 --> 40:37.153
They must have looked like each other.

40:37.952 --> 40:40.193
I mean, maybe exactly like each other.

40:41.993 --> 40:44.289
It gave Scott a chance to break free.

40:45.546 --> 40:46.818
She saved him.

40:47.993 --> 40:49.669
Allison saved his life.
