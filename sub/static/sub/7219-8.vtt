WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.448
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.604 --> 00:05.606
Hey, Uncle Jack? It's Kendal.

00:05.973 --> 00:09.011
You cared so much about Kendal,
he'd be back in Miami with you right now.

00:09.109 --> 00:12.454
Just like how you're down in Florida
with your little girl right now, you mean?

00:12.946 --> 00:14.323
Help me get Darryl.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.788
You really think I'd betray my family?

00:17.384 --> 00:20.854
Sorry you wasted your time coming all
the way up from Harlan just to give me shit.

00:20.954 --> 00:24.731
I didn't come up here to talk to you, Alison.
I came to talk to your boss.

00:24.825 --> 00:25.963
<i>Two weeks, huh?</i>

00:26.226 --> 00:28.638
- Yeah.
- I could use two weeks off.

00:28.695 --> 00:32.232
I got some vacation time.
I'm gonna go down to Florida, see my kid.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.039
Going on your own dime this time?

00:34.167 --> 00:36.738
No, Chief. I won it on a radio contest.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.143
That's why you
ought to rely on the Heavenly Mother.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.047
I'm not interested in religion, Penny.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.415
You interested in staying alive?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.318
You saying you can get heroin?

00:44.378 --> 00:45.686
That's what I'm saying.

00:45.746 --> 00:49.319
The hardest part ain't getting the drugs.
It's getting them inside.

00:49.416 --> 00:50.417
What do you want to do?

00:50.517 --> 00:54.158
I'm gonna book a one-way ticket to Mexico
and bring back my 25 kilos of heroin.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.598
Don't do it!

00:57.858 --> 01:00.031
- What the hell are you doing?
- He pulled on me!

01:01.562 --> 01:03.098
Good luck getting that shit out of Mexico.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.172
Tell Mr Yoon we have a problem.

01:19.379 --> 01:22.121
I hope they're talking about breakfast.
I'm starving.

01:22.215 --> 01:24.092
He's bitching about having to bury us.

01:28.221 --> 01:29.757
Alberio.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.197
While your demeanour
is cause for some relief,

01:32.259 --> 01:34.296
I take it there's more to the story.

01:35.228 --> 01:36.366
You keep your lives.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.440
You forfeit the shipment and the cash.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.103
The business relationship is over.

01:41.201 --> 01:43.112
Hey, come on, man. That is some bullshit.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.809
You agreed not to spill blood,
yet there are four bodies.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.247
Well, I don't see any bodies.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.215
I don't see any bodies
'cause my boys picked them up

01:52.279 --> 01:54.589
and hauled them back
across the border, Alberto.

01:55.882 --> 01:59.056
There will be no headlines
in your local paper.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.894
Now, I know I'm not in a position
to negotiate,

02:00.954 --> 02:02.900
but when I make a new friend,
I generally like to keep him.

02:02.990 --> 02:06.130
So, will you please
call Mr Yoon one more time?

02:11.598 --> 02:12.906
That's gonna look awful bad,

02:12.966 --> 02:15.674
we get pulled over
with a load of dead dudes in the truck.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.510
You ain't got to worry, cousin Dewey.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.615
We'll hide them underneath all that heroin.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.655
Okay.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.457
The bodies disappear, all is well.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.364
Boys, you heard him. Let's go!

02:39.192 --> 02:41.832
So, we get 'em in the truck,
but without Hot Rod's connection,

02:41.928 --> 02:44.340
how in the goddamn hell we supposed to
get four bodies across the fence?

02:44.431 --> 02:47.139
Jimmy, do I have to have an answer
for everything?

02:47.200 --> 02:50.511
Well, it ain't like
we ain't smuggled shit before.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.208
But through Texas?

02:52.305 --> 02:54.182
Who? Flores?

02:54.274 --> 02:55.514
He hates my ass.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.953
- He's over that shit.
- He ain't over it.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.957
Over what?
What, you kill his dog or something?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.959
His sister's definitely a dog.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.494
We didn't kill her.

03:03.550 --> 03:06.030
Except make her a little bowlegged
for a day or two.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.292
It ain't happening, man. We ain't calling him.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.699
She took a lot of dick for a little lady.

03:10.791 --> 03:11.861
The answer's no.

03:11.958 --> 03:17.135
Only thing that Flores loves more
than his ugly sister, is green gringo cash.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.144
He got that shrimp boat down in Matamoros.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.911
Come on.
What else are we gonna do? Think about it.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.840
Could be worth a shot.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.743
Well, then I suggest you take it

03:28.475 --> 03:31.422
'cause I don't care if it's up your ass
or on your back.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.492
You're responsible
for getting my dope across that border.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.760
Now, you shot 'em,
so you put 'em in the back of the truck.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.558
Okay.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.863
Let's go, y'all.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.004
Hey, little boy. Want a lollipop?

03:55.335 --> 03:56.712
I don't like candy.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.006
What kid don't like candy?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.687
You know, I lost a puppy near here.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.121
Real cute, just like you.
Want to help me find him?

04:05.212 --> 04:06.782
Don't like dogs.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.526
Get in.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.352
You're such an asshole, Uncle Jack.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.909
- You got big.
- You've gotten old.

04:25.365 --> 04:28.903
What do you say, grab your sister?
Get some breakfast?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.482
You'd be surprised.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.578
All that's sprung up in the north country...

04:38.645 --> 04:41.558
Every one of them,
bona fide American boomtown.

04:42.382 --> 04:43.452
You mark my words.

04:43.550 --> 04:47.430
Five, 10 years tops,
fracking is gonna wean us off the Iraqi oil tit,

04:47.487 --> 04:49.626
keep the jobs and the money right
here in the good old US of A.

04:49.723 --> 04:54.638
Wait. So you're sayin' you're in the
shale oil hydraulic fracturing business?

04:54.728 --> 04:56.639
No. Well, see, what I do,
I was moving around a bit,

04:56.730 --> 04:58.937
put down in Williston,
set up a regular game of Hold 'em.

04:59.399 --> 05:02.107
You know how it is with those roughnecks.
They get their 1st and 15th.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.477
Starts burning a hole in their pocket.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.345
It's been good for me.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.745
That's why I'm down here.
I wanted to take a few days off.

05:08.341 --> 05:09.479
Can I get another cocoa?

05:09.576 --> 05:11.146
It costs for refills.

05:11.411 --> 05:14.585
Shit. Are you serious?
What is it, a buck? Go on, man. It's on me.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.429
So, how is it that you actually got prettier?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.430
- Please, Jack.
What?

05:23.523 --> 05:26.299
You are just gonna
blow his hopes all out of whack,

05:26.426 --> 05:28.337
and I'm gonna have to stop it. Again.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.635
You just always do this.
You make me out to be the villain.

05:30.697 --> 05:33.177
No, I don't. That's not true, is it?

05:33.266 --> 05:34.802
Why are you really here? You need money?

05:34.935 --> 05:37.609
No, I don't need... I'm not here for money.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.185
The boy called me. A few times.

05:42.676 --> 05:46.453
Well, he probably just thought it was best
you visit while his brothers are gone.

05:47.948 --> 05:51.020
- How is Danny?
- He still wants to cut off your dick.

05:52.719 --> 05:55.325
So, is that really what this is, a visit?

05:55.388 --> 05:57.868
Is that so inconceivable?

05:57.958 --> 05:59.164
Hey, you know what I was thinking?

05:59.226 --> 06:02.036
Come this weekend,
how about I take you both to Cedar Point?

06:02.195 --> 06:03.970
- Where's that?
- Ohio.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.507
They got rally-coasters there.
One's called the Millennium Force.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.840
- Dude, ifs a face-melter.
- Let's do it.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.581
Actually, you know what?
I have a better idea.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.845
We'll go on your holiday break,
take a whole week.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.682
Do a whole rally-coaster tour.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.153
Yeah. Okay.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.819
Look, let's finish up and get you back
to school before you miss an entire day.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.652
Excuse me.

06:40.567 --> 06:41.705
So, you like it here?

06:42.369 --> 06:43.905
I hate it here.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.425
Shit!

06:57.350 --> 07:00.524
- Finally!
- God almighty. Stop freaking out.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.461
I'm not freaking out.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.967
You've left me, like, 800 messages.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.561
Would you put your Uncle Jack on the phone
right now?

07:07.627 --> 07:09.038
Okay.

07:09.863 --> 07:10.898
Yello?

07:11.064 --> 07:13.544
You listen to me.
You need to turn that car around.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.236
Wen, babe, we'll call you from Ohio.

07:15.302 --> 07:18.408
You asshole.
Turn around and get back here right now.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.083
Who were you talking to?

07:25.545 --> 07:26.888
I'm sorry. What?

07:27.314 --> 07:29.726
On the phone, all agitated. Who with?

07:30.550 --> 07:33.656
I don't work here.
I'm more of a silent partner.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.925
If you're looking for some action,
the girls don't get in till later. It's early still.

07:38.491 --> 07:39.561
Who was on the phone?

07:40.160 --> 07:43.437
You keep asking me that
like it's somehow your business.

07:47.267 --> 07:50.578
I apologise. That was rude of me.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.511
My name's Michael.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.817
I'm looking for a man named Jack Anderson.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.582
Heard he might be found here.

07:59.479 --> 08:03.518
I mean, Teena's got a regular
by the name of Jack Macy, I think,

08:03.616 --> 08:06.187
but I don't know any Jack Anderson.
He a local?

08:06.619 --> 08:08.462
He's from North Dakota. Why?

08:08.755 --> 08:11.668
Well, the guys around here
don't always volunteer their name,

08:11.758 --> 08:13.760
but sometimes where they're from.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.297
I don't really remember
anybody from North Dakota, though.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.504
Anyway...

08:20.600 --> 08:22.273
Can I get you a drink?

08:23.036 --> 08:24.174
I'm not hereto drink.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.475
You a cop?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.107
Do I look like a cop?

08:27.607 --> 08:29.609
I'd have believed you if you said you were.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.184
What you got back there?

08:36.515 --> 08:38.518
Somebody asleep on the job.

08:38.717 --> 08:41.664
Yeah. Well, good help's hard to find.

08:41.988 --> 08:43.797
Think I changed my mind.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.666
I'll have that drink.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.466
Rum and Coke.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.807
You got it.
I'll get it for you when I come back.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.429
Said I'd pay you back
for those drinks the other night,

09:47.520 --> 09:49.864
so I bought you something.

09:52.959 --> 09:55.405
- Lingerie? Really?
- A bathing suit.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.098
A nice one. Least, I think.

09:57.864 --> 10:02.973
Well, you know I don't have a pool
or a lake house or a membership at the Y.

10:03.069 --> 10:04.639
Funny story.

10:04.737 --> 10:07.081
I recently won some money
in a radio contest.

10:07.373 --> 10:08.374
What?

10:08.441 --> 10:09.442
Caller number seven.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.385
That's the craziest thing.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.583
And plus, I've been thinking about
what you asked me.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.418
I kind of forget.
Short-term memory is a casualty of my habit.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.727
On vacation.

10:21.988 --> 10:25.561
I was thinking take my winnings
and go down to Florida

10:25.625 --> 10:27.832
and see my baby girl, check in with the ex.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.463
That. Yeah.

10:29.562 --> 10:33.237
And I bought you that bikini
thinking you might want to come with.

10:33.666 --> 10:37.113
You want me to parade around
in front of your ex-wife?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.081
What, show off my body, make her jealous?

10:39.272 --> 10:42.151
No. I didn't suppose
you two would even meet.

10:42.242 --> 10:45.086
But I thought, hell, you're suspended.
Flights are cheap.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.285
We could blow the 2 grand on a nice motel.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.348
Really?

10:49.916 --> 10:50.986
Yeah.

10:51.084 --> 10:54.497
You could hang out at the spa
while I spend a little quality time

10:55.321 --> 10:57.801
and then we can meet up later
and have a meal or two.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.870
Still, taking a girl with you
to visit your semi-estranged family...

11:02.095 --> 11:03.096
It's a weird scenario.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.842
I didn't say it wasn't.

11:05.765 --> 11:06.766
But I'm trying.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.438
So, what do you say?
Will you come with me to Florida?

11:14.641 --> 11:15.779
All right.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.352
Cool. Well, pack a bag.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.292
You should grab that.
It's obviously something.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.663
- Givens.
- <i>Hi. It's Wendy Crowe. I need your help.</i>

11:27.720 --> 11:29.358
That's putting the shoe on the other foot.

11:29.889 --> 11:31.459
<i>Kendal's been abducted.</i>

11:31.658 --> 11:34.571
Well, then, you do need help, but not mine.
Call the police.

11:34.961 --> 11:38.807
Okay, not abducted abducted,
but he's gone. With his Uncle Jack.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.167
I thought our relationship was adversarial.

11:41.467 --> 11:42.810
Now you're reaching out?

11:43.536 --> 11:44.537
I'm on vacation.

11:44.804 --> 11:48.047
There's someone after Jack,
and I fear for Kendal's safety.

11:48.474 --> 11:49.976
Dial 911.

11:50.143 --> 11:53.022
You wanted something on my brothers.
I'm gonna give you something, okay?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.692
<i>They're in Mexico.</i>

11:54.914 --> 11:57.326
- And?
- And you'll get the rest later.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.821
You know that T-shirt, "I think
you've mistaken me for someone who..."

12:00.920 --> 12:04.697
I'll call your girlfriend's boss,
get her off her suspension.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.662
She's on paid leave.

12:06.926 --> 12:08.496
- She's fine with it.
- Who is it?

12:08.995 --> 12:11.669
Wendy Crowe. Kendal's run off with an uncle.

12:11.864 --> 12:15.539
She wants him back, and she's worried
there's this bad man that's after the uncle.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.516
Where are you?

12:24.677 --> 12:26.088
I know what you thinking.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.416
Well, I'll wager you a crisp Ben Franklin
you do not.

12:29.782 --> 12:33.753
You wondering,
"Can I trust these dusty-ass Crowe boys?"

12:34.087 --> 12:35.862
I owe you $100.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.529
You keep that money, Boyd.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.299
Time we get to Harlan with all them drugs,

12:41.394 --> 12:45.706
you'll realise you can make
so much more with us than without.

12:45.965 --> 12:51.972
Well, Darryl Jr., needing you and trusting you
are two altogether different things.

12:52.639 --> 12:57.213
I hope one day you stop
thinking of us as partners, but family.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.885
You sure about that?

12:58.945 --> 13:03.052
Yeah, man. I don't want all this mistrust
to go and poison the well.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.124
Well, I'll bear that in mind.

13:06.085 --> 13:10.727
And you bear in mind that I just executed
the last blood relative that I had.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.170
Hey!

13:15.828 --> 13:16.898
Hey!

13:17.964 --> 13:18.999
Shit.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.943
Hey!

13:22.468 --> 13:23.674
- Hey!
- What is y'all doing?

13:23.903 --> 13:24.973
Hey!

13:27.173 --> 13:28.481
Hey!

13:30.076 --> 13:31.919
Get out! Get out!

13:32.645 --> 13:35.489
Do you know we got 25 kilos of heroin
in the back of this truck?

13:35.581 --> 13:37.322
It's hot' man. it's goddamn hot.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.421
I can't take much more
riding back there with them corpses.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.490
The dude I was on,
I could feel his insides letting go.

13:43.589 --> 13:45.660
Couple more hours like that,
it's gonna be seven bodies.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.366
You better sleep with your eyes open!

13:51.464 --> 13:53.034
What's wrong with you, man?

13:53.132 --> 13:55.009
We gonna have to get another car.

13:55.134 --> 13:57.512
Well, can I request we get one with AC?

14:02.208 --> 14:03.778
Hello?

14:05.478 --> 14:07.116
Yeah.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.793
Well, can't be.
I know for a fact that card expires 2015.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.054
Well, it's not my fault it didn't clear.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.023
Wait.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.999
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What did you just say?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.732
Well, what did he look like?

14:24.564 --> 14:26.703
- Is that Wendy?
- No.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.310
I was at a motel last couple nights.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.645
Manager just called
and says I charged a bunch of stuff,

14:31.704 --> 14:34.082
but I didn't charge that stuff.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.016
So I didn't pay for it.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.021
But I was in there. I was thinking,

14:38.077 --> 14:39.852
I've rode all that shit at Cedar Point.

14:39.912 --> 14:42.483
What we should do is go hit Six Flags Texas.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.387
You know, I'm not a kid any more, okay?

14:46.986 --> 14:48.761
Tell me the truth. Are you in trouble?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.664
All right.

14:52.759 --> 14:57.572
I was at a bar back in Williston
with a buddy of mine and his sister.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.734
She heads into the can.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.778
And a few minutes later,
we start hearing this screaming.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.781
So I charge in there.
And I see her about to get raped.

15:05.004 --> 15:08.281
I had this pool cue in my hand,
and I just went off.

15:08.374 --> 15:12.117
I put the dude in the hospital.
And I just got out of Dodge.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.217
That was my buddy calling,

15:15.548 --> 15:18.688
saying the dude's out of his coma.
He's gunning for me.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.360
That's the truth.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.365
Think maybe you should go home.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.928
I bet you can handle him.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.542
Either way, I think you should go.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.548
Where?

15:48.114 --> 15:49.718
Hold on tight.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.599
Ready?

15:59.659 --> 16:01.969
One, two, three.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.776
Help! Guard!

16:08.835 --> 16:10.940
We need medical help!

16:11.237 --> 16:12.580
She's hurt.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.702
Any news?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.328
They were here. Now they're gone.

16:34.427 --> 16:37.533
Got a general heading
based on Kendall's cell pinging the towers,

16:37.630 --> 16:39.166
but not much more since we spoke.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.835
What about this Michael person?

16:41.100 --> 16:43.046
I can't pin him clown based on your story.

16:43.135 --> 16:45.809
Could be an old friend,
could be Jack's banging his wife.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.510
I don't know. He seemed to mean business.

16:47.773 --> 16:49.343
You shot his car full of buckshot.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.614
You think I provoked him?

16:50.977 --> 16:52.615
Well, I don't know, do I?

16:53.112 --> 16:56.719
See, this is that attitude you have had right
from the very beginning, this antagonism.

16:57.116 --> 16:59.289
I approached you, attempted to bargain.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.298
After considerable unpleasantness.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.294
Anyway, I'm here now.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.295
- To help.
- You've got your reasons.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.305
You are obsessed with my family' after all.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.704
No.

17:09.795 --> 17:13.902
I think of them like cancer,
and I'm just a doctor working on a cure.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.174
- I am deeply offended by that.
- You ain't offended.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.483
You're conflicted about helping me.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.175
All I want is to get Kendal back home safely.

17:22.742 --> 17:27.213
And yet, you were the one who took him
out of a good, Christian foster home,

17:27.313 --> 17:28.553
threw him back to those wolves.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.025
Time is wasting. Can we go?

17:33.586 --> 17:36.658
All right, come here.
Can you squeeze your fingers down in there?

17:36.722 --> 17:38.531
These things are a jiff to get started.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.931
We're stealing a car now?

17:40.393 --> 17:41.997
That wasn't clear?

17:43.162 --> 17:44.573
How much trouble are you in?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.666
Well, he's a very angry man,
and he knows my car.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.541
- You're lying.
- No. I'm not.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.104
Yes, you are. You lie about everything,
and you always have.

17:51.203 --> 17:52.375
Name one lie.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.844
You're my dad and Wendy's my mom.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.356
- How long have you known?
- A longtime.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.019
- Wendy told you.
- No, I figured it out, okay?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.891
Now cut the shit. What did you really do?

18:04.951 --> 18:07.192
'Cause I don't think you're some hero
that stopped a rape.

18:09.555 --> 18:12.126
I followed the workers, the money.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.599
North Dakota, Montana.
I was running poker games.

18:14.860 --> 18:18.239
And I had an idea that
I was gonna buy into this fracking operation.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.535
Coming through.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.877
Shit. Come on.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.475
I was gonna buy into this fracking operation
in Mexico.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.954
So I started skimming from my regular game.

18:30.042 --> 18:31.783
Heavy-duty player in particular.

18:32.411 --> 18:35.620
It was a good hustle, till the guy found out.
It's mostly his money in the bag.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.095
- How much?
- About $35,000.

18:39.585 --> 18:41.087
Trouble is, he wants it back, bad.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.735
So, you were trucking down to Mexico,
gonna lay low and start your own thing.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.630
And you got my call,
and you came back for me?

18:48.728 --> 18:49.968
That's exactly right.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.236
Why didn't you tell me that from the start?

19:02.608 --> 19:04.246
What a pussy.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.524
Crowder, Ava?

19:10.616 --> 19:12.027
Says the shoulder's dislocated?

19:12.118 --> 19:14.189
- Yes.
- Have a seat.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.766
Happened before. The coach just

19:17.923 --> 19:20.267
yanked it out and pushed it back in.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.705
Hurt like hell.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.469
Unless this was back before the Civil War,
your coach was a fool.

19:25.531 --> 19:26.942
Lay down. There you go.

19:27.767 --> 19:31.214
Wasn't quite that far back.
Going on 20 years now.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.277
All right.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.150
All right. Now it should feel better.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.785
All right, sit up.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.153
It does. It feels better.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.955
It'll be sore again later.
I can give you some aspirin.

19:46.118 --> 19:50.464
I was told that you might have a way
to bring in some more powerful painkillers.

19:51.223 --> 19:52.531
Don't lay on that side.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.469
And don't lift anything
more than five pounds.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.529
I said, I was told...

19:56.629 --> 19:58.540
You can't get more powerful pain meds,
all right?

19:59.131 --> 20:01.805
If you dislocated your own shoulder
just for that, you're an idiot.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.314
Get your aspirin from the dispensary.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.081
This mess.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.489
You don't see how trouble
follows your family?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.152
The men, mostly.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.490
What are they up to in Mexico?

20:19.985 --> 20:21.692
Kendal's not my brother.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.233
See? Now, that doesn't get me anywhere.

20:23.322 --> 20:26.360
He's my son. Jack is his father.

20:26.659 --> 20:27.933
Just thought you should understand.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.506
- Good lord. Why?
- I don't know.

20:32.364 --> 20:35.607
I was 22 when I met him.
I was studying for my LSATs.

20:36.068 --> 20:40.016
He was a real hustler
and an asshole piece of shit,

20:40.072 --> 20:43.383
but I found him intoxicating,
for some unknown reason.

20:43.442 --> 20:48.551
So I got pregnant, and, of course, the
thought of being a dad scared him shitless.

20:49.849 --> 20:50.953
So...

20:52.885 --> 20:55.695
As much as it might benefit you
to unburden yourself,

20:55.755 --> 20:57.234
I'd like to get back to Darryl

20:57.289 --> 21:00.099
and what criminal activity
he might be engaged in.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.036
Not until you get Kendal back.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.645
It's Jack. Where are you?

21:10.069 --> 21:11.878
Can we put aside the bad blood?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.780
- Can we do that?
- All right.

21:13.873 --> 21:14.977
'Cause I need your help.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.485
<i>All right. I'm listening.</i>

21:16.575 --> 21:18.054
We got to be smart about this.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.781
We got to scare up one of your brothers.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.156
Darryl, Dilly, Danny, whoever.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.123
I messed up, bad.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.630
Really, really bad.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.400
He's got Kendal.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.503
Sometimes shooting out a man's tyres
ain't enough.

21:37.596 --> 21:39.473
Maybe he had a second car
stashed somewhere

21:39.565 --> 21:41.977
or a second driver
keeping tabs on the situation.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.240
Or maybe he's just a bad dude
who's good at hunting people down.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.340
I just don't get it.
He found them before you did.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.281
But isn't that what Marshals
are supposed to do?

21:48.340 --> 21:51.412
Again' Wendy, I don't know
how the man beat me to the punch,

21:51.477 --> 21:52.820
and I don't give a shit.

21:53.245 --> 21:57.489
The important thing is not how
we arrived at this sad state of affairs.

21:57.583 --> 22:01.929
It's how we get Kendal back safe
so you can live up to your side of the deal.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.344
It's coming.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.307
Not here about that.

22:19.638 --> 22:21.777
You go to church as a girl?

22:22.208 --> 22:23.778
I did.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.985
But it didn't take, huh?

22:30.683 --> 22:32.458
Not for me, neither.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.339
But what me and my girls got going on here

22:46.966 --> 22:50.413
ain't about no Good Book
or the Holy Ghost feeling.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.515
It's about prayer.

22:53.806 --> 22:57.652
Pretty much every girl in here
is in here because of a man.

22:58.544 --> 22:59.682
You any different?

23:03.983 --> 23:07.260
Pretty girl like you, growing up in Harlan.

23:07.353 --> 23:09.856
You're in good shape still.

23:09.922 --> 23:12.493
Probably a cheerleader back in school.

23:13.325 --> 23:17.364
Probably went outwith the quarterback,
got married, had it good for a minute.

23:17.429 --> 23:19.375
Things got ugly, and you got divorced.

23:19.431 --> 23:20.569
How am I doing?

23:22.735 --> 23:26.080
Well, he wasn't a quarterback.
He was a running back.

23:26.171 --> 23:28.242
We didn't get divorced.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.842
I shot him.

23:31.877 --> 23:33.857
Good for you, sister.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.526
Who do you pray to?

23:39.184 --> 23:40.595
God.

23:41.787 --> 23:43.266
As I see her.

23:43.522 --> 23:45.433
For guidance.

23:45.524 --> 23:46.628
Strength.

23:47.026 --> 23:50.371
No man to come save us,
not even our release.

23:50.863 --> 23:54.538
Not even to find a way to get drugs in.

23:55.534 --> 23:59.038
Ain't none of that
our mother gods responsibility.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.442
That shit's on you.

24:14.553 --> 24:16.726
Tell me Kendal's all right.

24:16.789 --> 24:20.066
Come to the far end of the lot,
and I'll give you the dough.

24:21.393 --> 24:22.929
I don't feel comfortable
being the goddamn bait.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.908
You're only the bait if we're looking to catch
what's-his-name, which I'm not.

24:26.498 --> 24:29.411
What? Why are you even here?
What the hell? This is the bad guy in all this.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.811
That's how you see it, huh?

24:30.903 --> 24:33.315
I'm telling you, he's a heavy dude.
He's definitely wanted for something.

24:33.405 --> 24:34.748
Why you took the money and ran.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.788
You're such an unbelievable chicken shit.
Even I stood up to him.

24:37.843 --> 24:39.789
With a pump gun. All I had was this.

24:39.845 --> 24:42.655
Which, incidentally,
is just gonna piss him off.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.150
Because now what?

24:44.249 --> 24:46.593
'Cause he's expecting $35,000.
All I have is $20,000 in here.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.757
I bought that Chevelle,
which I hated to leave.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.528
Yeah, but leaving your son,
that you were fine with.

24:50.622 --> 24:51.999
I get it. I panicked and ran.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.593
Don't you think I feel shitty about it?
Jesus, Wendy.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.161
Let's not get bogged down in the past.

24:55.260 --> 24:56.671
- Focus on the plan.
- I feel shitty about it all.

24:56.762 --> 24:59.265
I should have never come got him.
I should have just blasted down south...

24:59.331 --> 25:01.333
- Don't you dare blame Kendal for this, Jack.
- What'd I just say?

25:01.433 --> 25:02.377
This whole thing is your own goddamn...

25:02.468 --> 25:05.039
But I'm not the one that makes him
want to leave his own family and escape.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.138
They're a bunch of psychos...

25:06.205 --> 25:08.776
When you knocked me up, you ran then, too,
didn't you? Story of your life.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.981
I do not want to hear another word
of this story.

25:12.277 --> 25:16.191
What's gonna happen is, when he comes,
you tell him all you got is the $20,000.

25:16.281 --> 25:19.888
He'll take it, even if I have to persuade him.
We'll take Kendal.

25:19.985 --> 25:22.158
And that's it? He just goes?

25:22.454 --> 25:24.695
Yeah, Jack. You, too.

25:24.790 --> 25:27.964
I want you to find a hole somewhere,
crawl in it, and stay there forever.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.299
Hey, how about a little respect?

25:30.629 --> 25:32.472
You know what your deal is?

25:32.798 --> 25:34.471
You're born to lose.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.206
Lose well for once.

25:36.301 --> 25:38.406
You might earn some respect.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.577
So, do we need 10 call for a backup?

25:41.673 --> 25:45.052
- I can handle one guy.
- Yeah, but what about Kendal?

25:45.144 --> 25:46.646
He'll be fine.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.214
Yeah. And if not, what do you care?

25:48.313 --> 25:51.226
You're clearly not legit.
What kind of trouble can you get in?

25:51.316 --> 25:53.091
I care. To a point.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.687
You balling Wendy? You owe her a favour?

25:54.753 --> 25:56.755
Your ex-wife and I have an agreement.

25:56.855 --> 26:00.166
What she's gonna tell me when this is over,
that's what I care about.

26:00.225 --> 26:03.035
Yeah. He's got a problem
with Darryl and Danny, too.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.668
So, he's not a total asshole?

26:25.584 --> 26:27.120
Shit.

26:33.725 --> 26:35.432
Not unless you have to.

26:35.527 --> 26:39.475
But if you have to,
you make every shot count.

26:47.739 --> 26:48.774
Boys.

26:53.545 --> 26:56.048
Well, I'm sorry,
but that's all the Spanish I know.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.219
Jimmy?

27:01.720 --> 27:03.063
Better I speak English, no?

27:03.422 --> 27:04.799
Well, it would help.

27:05.390 --> 27:08.394
- What are you carrying?
- Bibles.

27:08.460 --> 27:12.237
We're missionaries, here to spread the word
to the far-flung citizenry.

27:12.564 --> 27:16.842
Have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your lord and personal saviour?

27:21.807 --> 27:24.651
You do realise that this country
is 80% Catholic, right, gringo?

27:24.743 --> 27:26.780
Well, we're here for the other 20%.

27:28.914 --> 27:32.088
You think that people look at you
and you move them into conversion?

27:32.417 --> 27:35.523
Well, I do admit
we are a little rough around the edges.

27:35.921 --> 27:40.802
We have all done some time,
but have been saved by his personal light.

27:40.859 --> 27:42.998
For all have sinned
and fall short of the glory of God.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.836
That's Romans. It's in the Bible.

27:44.930 --> 27:46.000
Preach.

27:46.265 --> 27:49.109
You know, it's a dangerous road
to be travelling at night.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.341
You know
what happens around here, missionaries?

27:51.436 --> 27:55.441
We're just trying to make Reynosa,
hop across the border by sunrise.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.884
Yes, yes.

27:56.975 --> 27:59.455
But who will protect you lambs
in your journey, huh?

27:59.511 --> 28:00.888
Who but us?

28:02.181 --> 28:05.628
And unfortunately
protection does not come free, my friend.

28:05.984 --> 28:07.554
I'm sorry.

28:07.653 --> 28:10.862
Are you attempting to extort
servants of the lord?

28:14.193 --> 28:15.968
Let me tell you something, gringo.

28:16.295 --> 28:19.208
White people come to this country
for two reasons.

28:19.298 --> 28:22.074
One is for margaritas.
The other one is for <i>drogas.</i>

28:25.003 --> 28:26.209
How much?

28:26.305 --> 28:30.151
Now, that's better?
Now it's all out in the open, right?

28:30.209 --> 28:33.349
Let's call it 1,000.

28:33.478 --> 28:35.822
Pesos? <i>No problemo, mi amigo.</i>

28:36.014 --> 28:38.051
$2,000, <i>pendejo.</i>

28:38.217 --> 28:40.219
- Hell no!
- Darryl.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.993
No problem, amigo.

28:57.936 --> 28:59.745
And we will also lake the truck.

28:59.838 --> 29:01.181
- Man, we ain't giving up the...
- Hey!

29:03.909 --> 29:05.183
How we gonna give up the truck?

29:07.879 --> 29:09.881
The truck ain't for sale.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.635
Let me tell you something, my friend.

29:19.725 --> 29:22.365
In Mexico, everything's for sale.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.196
Everything-

29:29.801 --> 29:32.714
- God.
- Goodness. This is some bullshit, man.

29:33.939 --> 29:37.079
You gentlemen
have a pleasant night, safe trip.

29:37.309 --> 29:38.583
Enjoy Mexico.

29:53.258 --> 29:54.896
Can't clean up your own mess?

29:56.228 --> 29:58.572
Got to bring your girlfriend
and his big brother?

29:58.730 --> 30:00.403
Let's not escalate the situation.

30:00.832 --> 30:04.302
Well, I think that ship sailed
when ginger over here shot my car to shit.

30:04.403 --> 30:05.939
Mistakes were made.

30:06.004 --> 30:09.178
My experience, best to accept and move on.

30:09.274 --> 30:11.515
- I'm prepared to act in kind.
- Is that right?

30:13.145 --> 30:15.989
You'll never hear
the word "kidnapping" from me.

30:16.081 --> 30:17.424
I just want the boy home safe.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.257
Kendal, get out of the car.

30:20.585 --> 30:22.462
Take the money, Michael.

30:22.521 --> 30:25.092
You think that's what I want?
A couple of thousand dollars?

30:25.190 --> 30:26.931
I want to break this asshole in two.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.662
- Not gonna happen.
Punishment ought to fit the crime.

30:29.761 --> 30:31.172
Shit, Jack. What'd you do?

30:31.263 --> 30:32.606
He put my son in a coma.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.105
- The rapist?
- What?

30:34.700 --> 30:37.374
Well, he said he put a rapist in a coma,
but I didn't believe him.

30:37.636 --> 30:41.709
He was ripping off my son,
his partner in staking a weekly craps game.

30:41.873 --> 30:43.318
Shut up. Come on, man.

30:43.608 --> 30:45.884
My son found out
he was skimming every week.

30:46.611 --> 30:49.285
Instead of sitting down,
owning up, face-to-face,

30:49.348 --> 30:51.624
he hit him in the head with a brick
and ran like a pussy.

30:51.683 --> 30:52.684
New deal.

30:52.784 --> 30:54.991
You're both under arrest,
since you're a fugitive.

30:55.053 --> 30:56.157
You're a dick.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.462
Let KSP send you back to North Dakota,
work it out.

31:00.459 --> 31:01.802
Get off!

31:04.529 --> 31:06.873
Stay down. You, too.

31:06.965 --> 31:08.535
Man, Jack. Jesus.

31:15.841 --> 31:17.684
All right, I'll let him know.

31:19.144 --> 31:20.179
Hey.

31:22.848 --> 31:25.886
So, I've been thinking,
you know, this whole ordeal.

31:26.852 --> 31:29.492
Well, you and I have always had
a really shitty relationship.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.001
I've been a bad person.

31:35.494 --> 31:36.939
A bad mother.

31:37.763 --> 31:40.209
Yeah. There, I said it.

31:40.832 --> 31:42.743
I know you probably already suspected it,

31:42.834 --> 31:45.610
but I thought it was probably time
you heard it from me.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.581
So, there you go.

31:49.775 --> 31:52.517
- Pretty messed up, huh?
- Compared to what?

31:54.346 --> 31:56.053
Good point.

31:56.882 --> 31:58.520
Anyway,

32:03.388 --> 32:05.527
on the bright side,

32:06.091 --> 32:09.595
you only got half a dose
of the Crows-family DNA.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.708
Yeah, 'cause Dad's such a prize.

32:14.466 --> 32:17.310
I actually thought he was, once upon a time.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.147
Crazy, right?

32:26.745 --> 32:28.383
Anyway,

32:29.915 --> 32:31.553
how you want it to go now?

32:33.652 --> 32:35.222
I don't care,

32:36.221 --> 32:37.427
sis.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.341
This the one you talking about?

32:55.941 --> 32:58.148
Just need to check on your shoulder,
see how it's doing.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.822
You a fool coming to me like that.

33:02.914 --> 33:05.758
You don't speak about this shit
in the infirmary with other people around.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.955
You got it?

33:11.022 --> 33:12.160
I will help you.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.000
Two conditions.

33:14.092 --> 33:16.766
You don't let Judith know
I'm the way in on this shit.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.863
And your man outside...

33:19.764 --> 33:21.107
You got a man outside?

33:21.199 --> 33:22.269
Yes.

33:22.534 --> 33:23.808
He gonna have to do something for me.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.177
What's that?
- Not saying.

33:26.271 --> 33:27.375
Can you count on him?

33:29.641 --> 33:31.643
Okay, then. That's what ifs gonna take.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.986
- You in or you out?
- I'm in.

33:35.881 --> 33:37.656
Shoulder looks good.

33:38.283 --> 33:40.024
Stay out of trouble.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.168
How you doing?

33:50.228 --> 33:51.400
Who gives a shit?

33:51.730 --> 33:53.232
Think you'll survive three more years?

33:54.299 --> 33:56.506
- No.
- I bet you will.

33:57.302 --> 34:00.215
You know, turn 18,
can get the hell out of this mess.

34:00.305 --> 34:02.012
Join the Navy, make a life for yourself.

34:02.073 --> 34:05.384
Shit, strap on a backpack
and bum around France.

34:05.477 --> 34:06.979
It's not very likely.

34:08.413 --> 34:09.858
It gets better, Kendal.

34:09.915 --> 34:11.656
Man, I ain't gay.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.686
Same principle applies.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.891
Keep your head down,
think about the road ahead.

34:16.987 --> 34:18.262
You'll make it through okay.

34:18.723 --> 34:19.860
What the hell you know about it?

34:20.324 --> 34:22.202
More than you'd guess.

34:22.726 --> 34:25.833
I mean, I didn't grow up
with a whole family full of trouble, just one.

34:26.531 --> 34:29.068
But he was the asshole king of them all.

34:29.167 --> 34:30.771
Kept my head down, boy.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.775
And you grew up and become a cop.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.678
Big victory there.

34:35.940 --> 34:38.922
A lot of my friends
grew up with the same insanity in the home.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.385
Got caught up in it.

34:41.446 --> 34:44.552
Said, "Hell with tomorrow,"
and that was that.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.687
Very few of them living today.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.757
Trying to scare me straight?

34:48.853 --> 34:50.127
Just like a cop.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.228
- Here.
- What the hell?

34:55.293 --> 34:57.295
It's some money I won in a contest.

34:57.862 --> 34:59.808
It's not like it's mine, even, really.

35:02.534 --> 35:05.447
Man, you some kind of pervert or something?

35:05.537 --> 35:08.882
I don't want nothing from you, Kendal.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.544
Save it.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.616
For the future.

35:14.879 --> 35:16.825
Rather buy an ATV or a gun.

35:17.616 --> 35:22.122
So, I guess this is where
I'm supposed to be grateful.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.093
Or, if that's uncomfortable for you,

35:24.155 --> 35:26.260
you can just tell me
about your brothers' activities.

35:26.725 --> 35:31.731
I don't really know
what my brothers are up to in Mexico.

35:32.230 --> 35:33.607
You got to be kidding me.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.641
Mexico was kind of all I had.

35:35.734 --> 35:38.078
I needed to keep stringing you along.

35:38.269 --> 35:41.910
You... This... Lady, you are something.

35:43.008 --> 35:45.147
Can't you even tell me
where they are in Mexico?

35:45.243 --> 35:46.313
No.

35:46.411 --> 35:50.018
But isn't that what you Marshals do,
find people?

35:50.115 --> 35:51.992
I'd be in Florida about now.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.756
What?

35:53.818 --> 35:56.492
Nothing. Never mind.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.832
I got the kid.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.334
That's the important thing.

36:00.425 --> 36:02.769
Hey. Thanks again, Marshal.

36:03.628 --> 36:05.801
That was your first "thank you."

36:15.106 --> 36:16.346
It's coming.

36:16.941 --> 36:18.181
How?

36:18.276 --> 36:19.812
Not saying.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.884
You gave me your story,
but I still don't know you.

36:25.216 --> 36:28.663
Who's to say I tell you how,
you don't just go and out me out?

36:29.020 --> 36:30.363
You don't trust me.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.530
I don't understand you, either.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.971
Your whole God story, it don't add up.

36:41.900 --> 36:45.541
I'll admit, I'm disappointed.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.686
Where'd you learn all that Spanish?

36:53.411 --> 36:57.882
Cramming all the dope in this shit heap,
leaving them bodies in the back of the truck?

36:57.982 --> 37:01.395
That's a two-bird/one-stone
stroke of goddamn genius.

37:01.486 --> 37:03.397
I'd love to see their face
when they open the truck.

37:03.488 --> 37:04.523
Smell probably killed them.

37:04.656 --> 37:07.398
I'll bet they're scouring the countryside
for the likes of us,

37:08.226 --> 37:13.073
make us into heroes of legend and lore,
like Butch and Sundance.

37:13.164 --> 37:14.507
And their four redneck friends.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.069
Hey, man. To success, all right?

37:19.604 --> 37:21.584
Well, we ain't succeeded yet.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.711
Come on, Boyd. The way we played
them greedy-ass federales?

37:24.776 --> 37:27.620
You and me is working together,
ain't no mountain high enough.

37:27.712 --> 37:29.385
Easy, Tammi Terrell.

37:29.514 --> 37:32.222
- Your man was supposed to be here by now.
- He's coming, man.

37:32.283 --> 37:34.854
Everything last-minute
like this takes a little time, man.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.694
Come on, man.

37:36.755 --> 37:37.927
Let's go.

37:38.022 --> 37:40.059
Got to trust me, man.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.763
There it is.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.862
Look at that.

37:45.063 --> 37:46.542
And there he is.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.276
Hey!

37:49.901 --> 37:50.902
Shit.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.380
Hey, y'all wait right here.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.542
Where you go, I go.

38:03.214 --> 38:04.625
Darryl.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.290
Who are your friends?

38:08.419 --> 38:09.921
Question is, where's your boat?

38:10.221 --> 38:11.894
No. The question is, where's my money?

38:11.956 --> 38:14.095
I got 50 bricks in the trunk of the car.

38:14.159 --> 38:16.833
You take one for your troubles.
That'll more than cover it.

38:17.762 --> 38:19.799
- Okay. We take the car, too.
- All right.

38:20.498 --> 38:23.138
Take the truck. Drive into Matamoros,
cross the bridge into Brownsville.

38:23.234 --> 38:24.736
I'll see you in Galveston.

38:24.903 --> 38:25.904
That's awfully forgiving of you.

38:27.472 --> 38:28.576
Yeah, how's that?

38:28.907 --> 38:30.079
Well, I heard the story.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.245
Hey, Boyd, man.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.355
Now, these two boys
double-teamed my sister,

38:33.444 --> 38:36.254
I don't think I could
let the water go under that bridge.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.990
Why you got to bring that story up?
I mean, look.

38:40.084 --> 38:42.462
I told him the story of your sister, man.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.628
I wasn't saying it in a bragging way.
It just came out, man.

38:47.792 --> 38:49.703
It's a long time ago. We good, though, right?

38:50.962 --> 38:52.032
We good?

38:53.765 --> 38:55.438
If I went after every white boy
got with my sister,

38:55.500 --> 38:56.979
I'd have blisters on my gun hand.

38:57.368 --> 38:59.814
There it is. We good, man.

39:00.638 --> 39:02.276
Yeah, we good.

39:04.108 --> 39:06.145
I'll see you in Galveston.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.951
Let's go, man! Let's go home!

39:22.360 --> 39:25.705
Hey, Boyd. You got any money?
I was gonna get a bottle for the road.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.173
Hey, ponytail just said
something to the other one

39:31.236 --> 39:32.874
about Darryl calling his boss on Manes.

39:33.071 --> 39:35.415
You don't even have to tell me
what that means.

39:35.506 --> 39:38.077
- Darryl had this planned the whole time.
- Yes, sir.

39:38.676 --> 39:39.984
Y'all want to go home?

39:40.211 --> 39:41.849
What do you want to do?

39:41.913 --> 39:43.586
You heard the man.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.225
Let's go home!

39:47.318 --> 39:48.922
Shotgun!

39:54.492 --> 39:55.527
You find Kendal?

39:56.094 --> 39:57.095
I did.

39:57.662 --> 39:59.335
- Safe and sound.
- That's a relief.

39:59.864 --> 40:01.935
You gonna invite me in
or keep me out in the hallway all night?

40:04.602 --> 40:05.740
Sure. Come on.

40:06.437 --> 40:08.439
- Something the matter?
- No.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.182
Want me to open a bottle of wine for you?

40:12.176 --> 40:13.211
Nah.

40:13.278 --> 40:15.087
Well, I'm gonna get a beer.

40:15.179 --> 40:16.249
All right.

40:16.347 --> 40:18.418
I'm sorry about all this, by the way.

40:18.516 --> 40:20.587
You understand
why I hesitated to get involved.

40:20.685 --> 40:22.892
Don't... Don't apologise, please.

40:22.954 --> 40:25.935
Miss Crowe's gonna keep her word,
nullify your suspension.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.095
You may have your boss
watching your every move for a while,

40:28.192 --> 40:30.194
but you'll be back at work.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.265
Good, 'cause I cannot waste another day
stuck in this place.

40:33.631 --> 40:35.474
- About Florida...
- Yeah.

40:35.566 --> 40:36.806
I'm good. I'm ready.

40:37.435 --> 40:40.644
We might want to scale back
the extravagance a bit.

40:40.738 --> 40:43.947
I gave away the contest money to charity...

40:44.242 --> 40:46.882
Well, Kendal, on a whim.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.424
Really? That's unexpected.

40:48.479 --> 40:50.288
You're telling me.

40:50.381 --> 40:52.452
Us going wasn't tied to that money, though.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.791
I mean, we can go tomorrow morning.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.229
But now I'm due back at work.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.260
Right.

41:00.325 --> 41:03.966
Well, I can always enter another contest,
if you don't mind waiting.

41:04.062 --> 41:06.599
That way' we can plan it out, do it up right.

41:06.664 --> 41:08.166
Go, say, end of next month.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.247
We're not going to Florida, Raylan.

41:13.071 --> 41:14.607
You seem very sure about that.

41:15.406 --> 41:17.010
Yeah, unfortunately.

41:18.409 --> 41:19.513
So...

41:19.777 --> 41:21.313
Yeah.

41:22.580 --> 41:24.025
I'm breaking it off.

41:26.351 --> 41:28.921
How about that.
