[Crowd groans]

00:03.757 --> 00:04.856
I fucked your girlfriend.

00:04.858 --> 00:06.157
Everyone is talking about you.

00:06.159 --> 00:07.191
Your secret blog...

00:07.193 --> 00:08.959
Not so secret anymore.

00:08.961 --> 00:10.461
You humiliated me.

00:10.463 --> 00:11.696
[Horn honks, brakes screech]

00:11.698 --> 00:13.531
Jenna Hamilton tried to kill herself!

00:13.533 --> 00:14.465
Again!

00:16.001 --> 00:17.802
I was dead.

00:17.804 --> 00:19.537
Metaphorically speaking.

00:19.539 --> 00:22.273
Like Sylvia Plath, I'd taken my own life.

00:22.275 --> 00:25.075
Except while hers ended in an oven,

00:25.077 --> 00:26.778
mine ended on the internet.

00:26.780 --> 00:29.246
My blog was no longer a safe haven,

00:29.248 --> 00:31.549
so there was only one way
I could take refuge

00:31.551 --> 00:33.851
from the internal slaughter in my head.

00:33.853 --> 00:36.721
I had to put pen to paper.

00:36.723 --> 00:39.089
Turns out, releasing my blog to the public

00:39.091 --> 00:41.225
was not the answer to my problems.

00:41.227 --> 00:43.060
Once again, I was a pariah.

00:43.062 --> 00:45.062
And even though I hadn't forgiven

00:45.064 --> 00:46.631
my mom for writing the letter,

00:46.633 --> 00:48.599
she was wise to my guilt trips.

00:48.601 --> 00:50.535
So I couldn't expect
she would let me stay home,

00:50.537 --> 00:53.103
which meant I had to ensure it.

00:56.809 --> 01:00.778
Mom, I have a fever!

01:03.181 --> 01:06.050
My hand wasn't the only thing
getting hot and bothered.

01:06.052 --> 01:07.685
[Lacey giggling]

01:07.687 --> 01:09.854
My mom was too.

01:09.856 --> 01:12.523
Suddenly I didn't need
to play sick anymore.

01:12.525 --> 01:14.692
I was sick, and I needed to escape

01:14.694 --> 01:18.396
before I was confronted
with what I expected to see...

01:18.398 --> 01:22.967
My mother with a...

01:22.969 --> 01:24.134

01:29.675 --> 01:31.308
How are you feeling?

01:31.310 --> 01:33.410
- Uncomfortable.
- Understandable.

01:33.412 --> 01:35.412
It's probably a little shocking

01:35.414 --> 01:36.647
to see us together.

01:36.649 --> 01:38.649
Seeing you together, not so shocking.

01:38.651 --> 01:41.786
It's more of where and how.

01:41.788 --> 01:42.987
Mm-hmm.

01:42.989 --> 01:44.655
Just talk to us.

01:44.657 --> 01:46.090
What's going through your head?

01:46.092 --> 01:47.391
Your boobs.

01:47.393 --> 01:49.626
Might want to belt up.

01:49.628 --> 01:51.929
I thought you were dating Hannah.

01:51.931 --> 01:53.064
So did I.

01:53.066 --> 01:54.531
I wasn't.

01:54.533 --> 01:56.567
Which is why I came over
to clear things up.

01:56.569 --> 02:00.204
- And you did.
- [Growls softly]

02:00.206 --> 02:03.107
Are you guys back together?

02:03.109 --> 02:05.542
We're working it out.

02:05.544 --> 02:08.812
Right, there's still work to do.

02:08.815 --> 02:11.716
And if that work was gonna
happen in the house,

02:11.718 --> 02:13.650
I had to vacate the premises.

02:13.652 --> 02:17.788
Right, well, I am feeling much better now,

02:17.790 --> 02:19.556
so I'm gonna head to school.

02:19.558 --> 02:21.759
- Well, let me get dressed.
- She can drive herself.

02:21.761 --> 02:23.260
She is not driving
the slut-wagon.

02:23.262 --> 02:25.229
The thing will only
bring her negative attention.

02:25.231 --> 02:26.630
Car or no car,

02:26.632 --> 02:29.333
negative attention
was about the only attention

02:29.335 --> 02:31.702
I could expect.

02:33.371 --> 02:36.306
You sure you're feeling okay?

02:36.308 --> 02:37.474
You don't look so good.

02:37.476 --> 02:38.843
I'm fine.

02:38.845 --> 02:40.577
I wasn't, but how do you tell your mom

02:40.579 --> 02:41.946
you're about to walk into
a public lynching?

02:41.948 --> 02:43.080
Really?

02:43.082 --> 02:44.882
Well, there are a couple small things

02:44.884 --> 02:46.583
that happened recently which are making me

02:46.585 --> 02:48.552
a wee bit apprehensive.

02:48.554 --> 02:50.587
- Bitch!
- Like that.

02:50.589 --> 02:52.022
Don't call my daughter a bitch!

02:52.024 --> 02:54.458
Not her, you.

02:56.762 --> 02:58.095
What's going on?

02:58.097 --> 02:59.363
So Jake broke up with me

02:59.365 --> 03:00.697
and then caught me making out with Matty,

03:00.699 --> 03:01.999
which shouldn't have been a thing,

03:02.001 --> 03:03.868
'cause I was technically single,

03:03.870 --> 03:05.535
but he thinks I'm a cheater
because he didn't know

03:05.537 --> 03:06.937
that I was with Matty
before I was with him,

03:06.939 --> 03:08.705
so he thought that we
were seeing each other

03:08.707 --> 03:10.407
while I was seeing him,
that "him" being Jake.

03:10.409 --> 03:11.441
Following?

03:11.443 --> 03:12.709
So I exposed my blog

03:12.711 --> 03:14.411
and basically everything about myself,

03:14.413 --> 03:16.246
and I didn't realize that there
would be collateral damage,

03:16.248 --> 03:18.382
which I guess sort of
definitely involves you

03:18.384 --> 03:21.886
and the letter.

03:21.888 --> 03:25.256
Everyone knows I wrote the letter?

03:25.258 --> 03:27.792
You're disgusting.

03:27.794 --> 03:29.626
I know it seems like I did this on purpose

03:29.628 --> 03:31.495
because things aren't resolved between us.

03:31.497 --> 03:33.497
I didn't mean to hurt you.

03:33.499 --> 03:36.700
Have a nice day, honey.

03:43.942 --> 03:45.176
We need to talk.

03:45.178 --> 03:46.610
I can't.
Not now.

03:46.612 --> 03:48.745
Please, let me say my piece.

03:48.747 --> 03:51.215
Writing that letter to Jenna was terrible.

03:51.217 --> 03:52.749
- Agreed.
- And cruel.

03:52.751 --> 03:54.819
- I get it.
- No, you don't.

03:54.821 --> 03:57.822
But I do, because despite
how together I may seem

03:57.824 --> 03:59.556
I was once a misfit too.

03:59.558 --> 04:01.725
Yeah, I know it's hard to believe,

04:01.727 --> 04:03.160
but things weren't always smooth sailing

04:03.162 --> 04:04.494
for this old kimosabe.

04:04.496 --> 04:07.764
And do you know who always lifted me up?

04:07.766 --> 04:09.666
- Your mother.
- That's right.

04:09.668 --> 04:11.802
And let me tell you,
I was pretty heavy back then.

04:11.804 --> 04:13.904
I had a tendency to eat my feelings,

04:13.906 --> 04:17.440
but no matter how heavy my load

04:17.442 --> 04:18.774
or my ass,

04:18.777 --> 04:20.410
my mother could always lighten it

04:20.411 --> 04:22.379
with her unconditional love

04:22.381 --> 04:24.715
because that is what good mothers do.

04:24.717 --> 04:28.118
They love their kids.
They don't tear them down.

04:28.120 --> 04:31.388
L-Dawg, I really expected

04:31.390 --> 04:33.390
we were on the road to being besties,

04:33.392 --> 04:35.993
but now I...

04:35.995 --> 04:38.863
I don't think I can even be your friend.

04:45.003 --> 04:46.603
[Sighs]

04:46.605 --> 04:48.239
What kinda day are we looking at,

04:48.241 --> 04:49.606
lunch in the bathroom?

04:49.608 --> 04:51.175
Nope, I'm clear for quad exposure.

04:51.177 --> 04:53.677
I'm back in with the mafia, big time.

04:53.679 --> 04:56.380
They got my parents to buy me a car.

04:56.382 --> 04:58.148
You're kidding.
Why?

04:58.150 --> 04:59.449
It's a peace offering.

04:59.451 --> 05:01.318
Becca's scared shitless of you,

05:01.320 --> 05:02.686
and by proxy, now me.

05:02.688 --> 05:04.321
Why is she scared of me?

05:04.323 --> 05:05.922
'Cause putting yourself up
for public consumption

05:05.924 --> 05:07.524
is, like, batshizat on crack.

05:07.526 --> 05:10.227
You're the scariest kind
of loose cannon, Jenna.

05:10.229 --> 05:11.561
You're a suicide bomber.

05:11.563 --> 05:12.696
I wasn't trying to blow myself up.

05:12.698 --> 05:14.098
Motive doesn't matter

05:14.100 --> 05:15.499
but mission accomplished.

05:15.501 --> 05:17.834
Your social suicide scared everyone silent.

05:17.836 --> 05:20.704
I assumed it was merely
the calm before the storm,

05:20.706 --> 05:23.908
and as such I was
battening down the hatches.

05:23.910 --> 05:26.476
Watch it!

05:26.478 --> 05:28.112
- Jenna.
- Sorry, Julie.

05:28.114 --> 05:29.780
Julie.

05:29.782 --> 05:32.149
I had hit the hornets nest...
The Julies.

05:32.151 --> 05:33.717
They were power brokers,

05:33.719 --> 05:36.287
the kind of girls who could
make or break a reputation

05:36.289 --> 05:38.722
with a simple smile or a smirk.

05:38.724 --> 05:40.291
Nobody wanted to mess with them,

05:40.293 --> 05:42.927
and I definitely didn't want
them to mess with me.

05:42.929 --> 05:45.095
- What you did was ballsy.
- And psychotic.

05:45.097 --> 05:46.530
It was a mistake.

05:46.532 --> 05:48.432
No, the mistake was ditching
Matty for Jake.

05:48.434 --> 05:49.967
Team Jake all the way!

05:49.969 --> 05:52.136
Seriously, when Matty
showed up at the dance,

05:52.138 --> 05:53.537
total panty drop.

05:53.539 --> 05:54.738
Forget you.

05:54.740 --> 05:56.106
Nothing trumps the bit with Jake

05:56.108 --> 05:57.541
when he decked out his mom's minivan.

05:57.543 --> 05:59.643
It wasn't really a bit.

05:59.645 --> 06:01.211
That actually happened.

06:01.213 --> 06:03.948
Whatever.
I just loved it.

06:03.950 --> 06:05.215
Anyhoo, gotta go.

06:05.217 --> 06:06.984
Back-up pants a-calling.

06:09.220 --> 06:11.355
That was strange.

06:11.357 --> 06:12.556
And unexpected.

06:12.558 --> 06:13.757
She just said
"back-up pants."

06:13.759 --> 06:15.025
That was her quoting you quoting me.

06:15.027 --> 06:17.594
Do you realize what just happened?

06:17.596 --> 06:19.763
You've just been bitch-backed
by the Julies.

- Okay.
- You don't get it.

You may not have a budget or marketing,

but you're interesting

and you're catching on
with the right peeps.

06:27.506 --> 06:29.673
Peeps that get you and care what you think.

06:29.675 --> 06:31.108
Nobody cares what I think.

06:31.110 --> 06:33.110
But ironically, they did.

[Overlapping talking]

06:48.594 --> 06:51.028

Suddenly everyone needed
my opinion on their life

06:53.966 --> 06:55.265
and to weigh in on mine.

06:55.267 --> 06:57.167
It was overwhelming

and exhilarating.

Ho and tell?

Look, I know Jenna's blog

07:19.792 --> 07:21.190
didn't paint you in the best light.

07:21.192 --> 07:23.460
But you gotta give her credit.
She can spell.

07:23.462 --> 07:24.994
I'm not going to give her credit

07:24.996 --> 07:27.631
for anything except inducing my stress.

07:27.633 --> 07:30.834
She totally exaggerated
Ricky's past indiscretions

07:30.836 --> 07:32.368
on that retarded blog,

You've been making out.
That is a kiss blister.

This is not that.

It's a zit.

Maybe it is a good time to talk.

08:24.389 --> 08:26.255
'Cause my new positive approval rating

- I don't know about them.

my slanguage left and right.

08:59.256 --> 09:01.625
Turns out my great expectations,

09:01.627 --> 09:03.192
not so great.

09:09.984 --> 09:11.418
Hey, do you mind if we switch seats?

09:11.420 --> 09:13.787
I do.
I'm not on your team.

09:13.789 --> 09:15.622
I am.
You could switch with me.

09:15.624 --> 09:19.526
Thanks, but my objective
is to get further from someone,

09:19.528 --> 09:20.560
not closer.

09:20.562 --> 09:23.030
- Can we trade?
- No.

09:23.032 --> 09:25.532
You're lame.
No wonder Jenna dumped you.

09:25.534 --> 09:27.634
All right, frenchies,

09:27.636 --> 09:30.837
Miss Kang had an emergency
and had to go home,

09:30.839 --> 09:34.174
probably 'cause she ate some
bad creme fraiche this morning.

09:34.176 --> 09:37.444
Some creme not-so-fraiche,
huh?

09:39.013 --> 09:40.513
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

09:40.515 --> 09:42.316
Well, I didn't have time to call in a sub,

09:42.318 --> 09:43.984
so you're watching a movie.

09:43.986 --> 09:45.485
It's called <i>Jules and Jim.</i>

09:45.487 --> 09:47.720
So in case you wanna tune out
and take a napster,

09:47.722 --> 09:49.256
here are the highlights.

09:49.258 --> 09:52.092
"Two best friends fall in love
with the same woman,

09:52.094 --> 09:54.294
who leaves the insecure one
for the passionate one,

09:54.296 --> 09:56.163
causing friction between them.

09:56.165 --> 09:58.631
Then the woman drives
one of them off a bridge."

09:58.633 --> 10:01.634
A stupid suicidal girl
comes in between two friends.

10:01.636 --> 10:03.270
That sounds familiar.

10:03.272 --> 10:05.839
Oh, it's just like Jenna Hamilton's life.

10:05.841 --> 10:07.640
Except the movie is better

10:07.642 --> 10:10.910
because the girl actually dies.

10:10.912 --> 10:12.612
I hope you're taking notes,

10:12.614 --> 10:15.082
'cause Matty's
not in the wrong... You are.

10:15.084 --> 10:16.450
Listen, I appreciate your opinion,

10:16.452 --> 10:18.118
but you don't have all the information.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.053
Actually, I do.
I read the blog.

10:20.055 --> 10:21.621
Good for you, but there's no way

10:21.623 --> 10:24.091
a stupid movie's gonna
give me a new perspective.

10:24.093 --> 10:27.894
I'm never talking to that asshole again.

10:27.896 --> 10:30.897
[Speaking French]

10:34.002 --> 10:37.270
We should talk.

10:37.272 --> 10:39.706
Why didn't you just tell me
that the camp girl was Jenna?

10:39.708 --> 10:40.907
I don't know, man.

10:40.909 --> 10:42.309
I was still figuring it all out

10:42.311 --> 10:44.378
when suddenly you were into her,

10:44.380 --> 10:46.446
and every time I tried to tell you,

10:46.448 --> 10:47.780
it got more complicated.

10:47.782 --> 10:49.383
More complicated than this?

10:49.385 --> 10:52.252
Dude, I don't want our
friendship to go out this way.

10:52.254 --> 10:54.687
- Neither do I.
- So what do we do?

10:54.689 --> 10:56.089
We just move on.

10:56.091 --> 10:57.790
And we tell each other the truth, okay?

10:57.792 --> 10:59.759
About everything.

10:59.761 --> 11:01.228
Yeah.
Good for me.

11:01.230 --> 11:03.296
Me too.

11:03.298 --> 11:04.131
Well...

11:04.133 --> 11:07.967
- So you should know...
- So you should know...

11:07.969 --> 11:11.438
- I still love Jenna.
- I still love Jenna.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.174
[Overlapping chatter]

11:14.176 --> 11:15.542
Can you help get me somewhere safe

11:15.544 --> 11:16.609
and out of the spotlight?

11:16.611 --> 11:17.911
I got you, J.

11:17.913 --> 11:19.312
Back off, sycophants.

11:19.314 --> 11:21.048
Jenna doesn't have all the answers.

11:21.050 --> 11:22.982
But you do have all the answers.

11:22.984 --> 11:24.717
Have you read my blog?

11:24.719 --> 11:26.520
I don't.
My life is a mess.

11:26.522 --> 11:27.921
<i>Au contraire.</i>

11:27.923 --> 11:29.356
That's French for
"on the contrary."

11:29.358 --> 11:30.623
I gathered.

11:30.625 --> 11:32.392
Your life isn't a mess.
It's amazing.

11:32.394 --> 11:34.761
You have friends,
a bro-down,

11:34.763 --> 11:36.263
and a very nice way with words,

11:36.265 --> 11:38.932
which I know because I devoured
every last one of them,

11:38.934 --> 11:40.767
virtually speaking of course.

11:40.769 --> 11:42.135
Of course.

11:42.137 --> 11:43.803
So here's what I need to know.

11:43.805 --> 11:45.738
I was bracing myself.

11:45.740 --> 11:48.708
Will you help me write my memoir?

11:48.710 --> 11:50.243
[Toilet flushes]

11:50.245 --> 11:52.011
This is getting insane.
I'm not a role model.

11:52.013 --> 11:54.114
No, you're a Lifetime movie.

11:54.116 --> 11:57.317
Seriously, we should think
about adapting your blog.

11:57.319 --> 11:58.985
This isn't a movie, this is my life,

11:58.987 --> 12:00.554
and I don't have a remote to take control

12:00.556 --> 12:03.457
or delete the traumatic episodes
involving Matty and Jake.

12:03.459 --> 12:05.625
They're never gonna talk to me again.

12:05.627 --> 12:07.394
That's so major!

12:07.396 --> 12:08.728
May-jer!

12:08.730 --> 12:10.230
May-jor!

12:12.366 --> 12:13.433
May-jer, may-jor.

12:13.435 --> 12:15.702
Lose the E and stress the O.

12:15.704 --> 12:17.170
Amazeballs.
And so are you.

12:17.172 --> 12:19.139
You really dodged a bullet
with that Ricky reject.

12:19.141 --> 12:21.575
Rumor has it he's rocking some nasty STDs

12:21.577 --> 12:23.410
in his sex-cretins.

12:23.412 --> 12:24.511
Sex-cretions.

12:24.513 --> 12:26.246
But he is a cretin, that's for sure.

12:26.248 --> 12:27.247
[Giggling]

12:27.249 --> 12:30.049
See, Jenna?
Nothing to worry about.

12:30.051 --> 12:31.985
You're on a positively positive upswing.

12:31.987 --> 12:33.620
The boys are bound to come around.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.088
No doubt.

12:35.090 --> 12:37.224
I mean, it's not like you gave them herpes.

12:43.331 --> 12:44.897
Shit.

12:44.899 --> 12:47.033
[Bell rings]

12:58.179 --> 13:00.213
Finally, the tide had turned,

13:00.215 --> 13:02.048
and I was about to get the smackdown

13:02.050 --> 13:03.583
I had anticipated.

13:03.585 --> 13:06.953
Okay, here we go.

13:06.955 --> 13:09.189
Lay it on me.
I'm ready.

13:09.191 --> 13:12.592
We've decided not to let
a girl come between us.

13:12.594 --> 13:13.760
I understand.

13:13.762 --> 13:16.396
So you need to choose.

13:16.398 --> 13:19.399
Him or me.

13:19.401 --> 13:20.833
Team Jake!

13:20.835 --> 13:22.369

I know!
Just let me be!

13:37.636 --> 13:39.269

13:42.006 --> 13:44.040
- Please don't.
- Hello.

13:44.042 --> 13:47.244
I'm fine.

13:47.246 --> 13:51.080
My mother is not a monster.

13:51.082 --> 13:52.415
Has this been happening all day?

13:52.417 --> 13:54.317
Honey, don't worry about it.

13:54.319 --> 13:55.752
How 'bout a snack?

13:55.754 --> 13:58.788
Apparently my stigma hadn't disappeared.

13:58.790 --> 14:00.923
It transferred to my mother.

14:00.925 --> 14:02.659
Mom, I'm so sorry.

14:02.661 --> 14:05.228
You have nothing to apologize for.

14:05.230 --> 14:06.463
I deserve this.

14:06.465 --> 14:08.298
This isn't tit for tat, I swear.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.699
I know.

14:09.701 --> 14:11.401
Because even though
you haven't forgiven me,

14:11.403 --> 14:13.936
you have never been cruel.

14:13.938 --> 14:15.605
But I have.

14:15.607 --> 14:19.008
That letter was cruel.

14:19.010 --> 14:21.311
So why did you write it?

14:24.014 --> 14:27.317
[Sighs]

14:27.319 --> 14:28.551
The day I wrote it,

14:28.553 --> 14:30.520
my mother laid into me,

14:30.522 --> 14:33.456
telling me that I wasn't raising you right.

14:33.458 --> 14:36.726
And instead of tuning her out,

14:36.728 --> 14:38.828
I tuned her in.

14:38.830 --> 14:42.599
And I did what I never wanted to do.

14:42.601 --> 14:46.703
I attacked you the way that
she has always attacked me,

14:46.705 --> 14:50.139
and it wasn't right or fair.

14:50.141 --> 14:51.775
It was just a family pattern

14:51.777 --> 14:53.943
that apparently I couldn't break.

14:53.945 --> 14:55.111
We need to call dad.

14:55.113 --> 14:56.346
No, please don't call him.

14:56.348 --> 14:57.814
He can fix this.

14:57.816 --> 14:59.949
I know, but he can't fix me.

14:59.951 --> 15:01.951
I'm a monster.

15:01.953 --> 15:04.020
That's not true.

15:04.022 --> 15:06.790
Jenna.

15:06.792 --> 15:10.460
Your dad didn't stay with me for me.

15:10.462 --> 15:11.828
He stayed for you.

15:11.830 --> 15:15.031
And while I will always be your mother

15:15.033 --> 15:19.103
and I will always love you,

15:19.104 --> 15:22.972
you have a choice.

15:22.974 --> 15:27.544
You don't have to love me.

15:27.546 --> 15:30.380
Again, my life was full
of unexpected choices.

15:30.382 --> 15:34.251
Choices that I didn't want to make.

15:34.553 --> 15:37.720
You can handle this with medication.

15:37.722 --> 15:39.889
I don't want to take medication.

15:39.891 --> 15:42.559
I want to wring Ricky's neck.

15:42.561 --> 15:43.860
And you should.

15:43.862 --> 15:45.728
A real man would have disclosed.

15:45.730 --> 15:46.930
He's branded you for life.

15:46.932 --> 15:48.297
So should I break up with him?

15:48.299 --> 15:49.498
I don't know.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.701
Who else is gonna want you now?

15:51.703 --> 15:54.871
Actually, a lot of guys.

15:54.873 --> 15:56.573

one out of every four.

16:03.832 --> 16:04.955
Hi.

16:06.824 --> 16:07.889
Yes, this is Sadie.

16:10.869 --> 16:12.071
It's not herpes.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.605
- So it's nothing.
- I told you so.

16:16.422 --> 16:20.117
I was just about to break up
with Ricky thanks to you...

16:20.731 --> 16:24.343
I'm gonna go before I wring your neck.

16:26.604 --> 16:28.204
Dropped a new word today.

16:28.206 --> 16:31.207
"Adora-whore-able."

16:31.209 --> 16:32.675
Adora-whore-able?
What's it mean?

16:32.677 --> 16:34.077
Slutty yet sweet.

16:34.079 --> 16:35.344
You've heard it?

16:35.346 --> 16:36.779
Unfortunately.

16:36.781 --> 16:38.648
Amanda Shillingford
said it in reference to me

16:38.650 --> 16:40.149
on my way out of Geometry.

16:40.151 --> 16:43.019
God, I'm so on fire!
I'm trendsetting.

16:43.021 --> 16:45.254
And I'm trending in two categories,

16:45.256 --> 16:47.757
hashtag Jenna-pick-Jake
and Jenna-pick-Matty.

16:47.759 --> 16:49.291
Why can't everyone
just mind their own business?

16:49.293 --> 16:50.827
You need to breathe.

16:50.829 --> 16:54.130
And then tell us, who's it gonna be?

16:54.132 --> 16:56.733
- Is it Matty or me?
- No pressure or anything.

16:56.735 --> 16:58.200
I appreciate that.

16:58.202 --> 16:59.636
But we need to know.

16:59.638 --> 17:03.039
And so did everyone else.

17:03.041 --> 17:05.008
I just... I can't think
like this.

17:05.010 --> 17:07.542
Then don't.
We'll do it for you.

17:07.545 --> 17:09.244
I can vouch for Matty.

17:09.247 --> 17:11.748
He's a good-looking guy
with a great head of hair

17:11.750 --> 17:13.415
and a really big heart.

17:13.416 --> 17:14.784
Wow.
That means a lot, man.

17:14.786 --> 17:16.452
And see, it's that kind of thoughtfulness

17:16.454 --> 17:18.220
that makes Jake the better contender.

17:18.222 --> 17:20.321
He's about the best kind
of friend to have around

17:20.324 --> 17:21.991
when the going gets tough.

17:21.992 --> 17:24.093
Well, you're no slouch
in that department either, man.

17:24.095 --> 17:25.662
I don't know, what would
I have done without you

17:25.664 --> 17:27.563
when my brother went to rehab last year?

17:27.565 --> 17:29.032
And when my mom had that cancer scare,

17:29.034 --> 17:30.399
you were right by my side.

17:30.401 --> 17:31.968
And I'll be there again.

17:33.804 --> 17:36.305
So?

17:36.307 --> 17:39.308
I've made a decision.

17:39.310 --> 17:40.609
You should date each other.

17:40.611 --> 17:42.712
[Onlookers gasp]

17:53.024 --> 17:54.690
Is mom coming to dinner?

17:54.692 --> 17:56.426
She went to bed.

17:56.428 --> 17:57.894
It's 6:00.

17:57.896 --> 17:59.496
She's had a rough couple of days,

17:59.498 --> 18:02.298
and she's gonna get through it.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.634
With you?

18:04.636 --> 18:07.037
I'm not going anywhere.

18:12.076 --> 18:15.811
Did you only stay with mom for me?

18:15.813 --> 18:17.680
Your mom tell you that?

18:17.682 --> 18:20.716
Yeah.

18:20.718 --> 18:23.420
Uh, when we were younger,

18:23.422 --> 18:26.722
I did and said
a lot of awful things to her,

18:26.724 --> 18:32.662
things she's forgiven
but clearly hasn't forgotten.

18:32.664 --> 18:35.631
I... I wasn't always
the best guy.

18:37.668 --> 18:39.069
Let's be real,

18:39.071 --> 18:41.171
she hasn't always been the best either.

18:41.173 --> 18:42.305
No, I know.

18:42.307 --> 18:44.307
But you've got to cut her some slack.

18:44.309 --> 18:47.777
Because what you don't know
is that I wasn't always around

18:47.779 --> 18:50.080
as much as I should have been.

18:50.082 --> 18:52.348
And when I was,

18:52.350 --> 18:54.384
you didn't want me to hold you.

18:54.386 --> 18:55.851
That's not true.

18:55.853 --> 18:57.787
You were the only one
who could put me to sleep.

18:57.789 --> 18:59.389
With your mom's song.

18:59.391 --> 19:02.058
Singing that lullaby

19:02.060 --> 19:05.661
was the only way to get you to calm down.

19:05.663 --> 19:08.998
So your mom taught it to me.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.367
She wanted me to be your hero.

19:11.369 --> 19:13.636
You are my hero, dad.

19:13.638 --> 19:16.939
And your mom is mine.

19:22.613 --> 19:24.847
In an unexpected turn of events,

19:24.849 --> 19:27.683
I was neither a winner nor a loser.

19:27.685 --> 19:29.352
I was a chooser.

19:29.354 --> 19:30.520
But someone had to win.

19:30.522 --> 19:31.988
Someone had to lose.

19:31.990 --> 19:33.823
And I was still left to choose.

19:33.825 --> 19:35.391
It was a big decision

19:35.393 --> 19:37.527
and not an easy one to make.

19:37.529 --> 19:38.694
[Computer beeps]

19:44.568 --> 19:47.270
So I had chosen...

19:49.640 --> 19:52.275
my mom.

19:55.179 --> 20:00.517
Â♪ Special wonderful surprise Â ♪

20:30.659 --> 20:31.945
Next on Awkward...

20:32.091 --> 20:34.150
"If you had to do-over,
how would you handle it?"

20:34.152 --> 20:36.018
A do-over... It was
an interesting concept.

20:36.020 --> 20:37.520
I was afraid you weren't gonna show.

20:37.522 --> 20:39.556
Wait.

20:39.558 --> 20:41.224
"Enough about Matty.
I'm pro-Jake."

20:41.226 --> 20:42.792
So I'll break it off with Matty,

20:42.794 --> 20:44.626
you get rid of Lissa,
and we can be together.

20:44.628 --> 20:45.461
Cool.

20:45.463 --> 20:47.329
I didn't have to choose
between Matty or Jake,

20:47.331 --> 20:48.198
but I wanted to.

20:48.200 --> 20:52.000
And I finally knew who it would be with.

20:53.305 --> 20:59.888
