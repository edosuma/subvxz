00:34.201 --> 00:37.204
Okay, everybody! Hello!

00:37.504 --> 00:39.140
Hi!

00:40.040 --> 00:41.475
Thanks for coming.

00:43.664 --> 00:46.480
So this is a really big day for me.

00:47.280 --> 00:52.485
I guess. Well, duh.
'Cause it's my only son's baptism.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.959
I love paper.

01:01.428 --> 01:04.230
I do. It's, like, my passion.

01:04.331 --> 01:07.768
And I've always wanted
to own my own <i>papiere.</i>

01:08.561 --> 01:10.404
Not that you care,
because I don't... You know what?

01:10.504 --> 01:13.040
I don't tell people that,
because people steal ideas all the time.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.411
It's happened to me numerous
occasions with... what?

01:16.806 --> 01:17.811
What did you say?

01:17.911 --> 01:20.014
- You just said something. What?
- I didn't say anything.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.416
Yes, you did. You made,
like, a noise or something.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.416
Whatever.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.091
Great.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.592
- God...
- You were saying?

01:31.692 --> 01:35.563
I know what I'm saying! I know what
I'm saying. Just let me say it.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.766
I had this whole thing prepared
about God and paper and love

01:38.866 --> 01:42.539
and godparents, and it was all tied
in together. Now I can't do it now.

01:42.639 --> 01:44.705
I can't do it now. So...

01:44.805 --> 01:47.174
You know what? You can say something.

01:47.463 --> 01:49.441
Ward!

01:50.478 --> 01:52.644
- Say it.
- Okay. Okay.

01:53.846 --> 01:55.580
I'll just plate the cake.

01:59.852 --> 02:01.288
- We would like to thank...
- No, not "we," Ward.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.658
I wanted to say something, and you
ruined it. You didn't let me say it,

02:03.758 --> 02:08.060
so now it's on you. You can
fucking say something, you asshole.

02:15.735 --> 02:17.938
Thank you all for coming.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.343
- We've got cake!
- Right.

02:25.646 --> 02:30.518
I just wanna smash her fucking
face right in that fucking cake.

02:30.618 --> 02:33.787
I worked on that speech. I put my heart
into that speech, and you ruined it.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.357
You gonna let her up?

02:36.457 --> 02:39.291
- I wouldn't.
- Fuck her.

02:52.538 --> 02:54.008
Are you sure it's not in your bag?

02:54.108 --> 02:56.543
Yeah, honey, I'm sure.
You said you saw it in the bathroom?

02:56.643 --> 02:59.980
I never said that. You're nervous.

03:00.080 --> 03:05.419
No, I'm not... I'm not nervous, I'm excited.
I mean, it's Robin Peters, you know?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.921
I don't even remember the
last thing she was in.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.923
- How does she look these days?
- Well, here.

03:13.726 --> 03:14.860
Pretty good.

03:19.832 --> 03:23.971
Do you think she has implants?
Maybe I should get implants.

03:24.071 --> 03:28.209
- Maybe her, not you.
- Well, it looks like it.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.544
See if you can tell,
but don't be obvious.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.944
Can you give me a break?

03:36.482 --> 03:38.634
Babe, I checked there.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.691
Well, thank you.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.292
All right.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.762
- I love you. I will see you later.
- I love you too.

03:48.862 --> 03:52.399
Maybe we can do some loving tonight?

03:52.499 --> 03:55.936
Yeah. Okay.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.372
Lily, come on, honey. We gotta move.

03:58.472 --> 04:02.042
Hello? Y... Oh. Sorry. Hey.

04:02.742 --> 04:06.880
Yeah, yeah. I got it all.
Got her lunch, her snack, got all her shit.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.917
What? She can't hear me.
She's in the other room.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.719
I'm right here.

04:11.819 --> 04:15.956
She just rounded the corner.
We got it. We'll be there.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.923
- Traitor.
- Potty mouth.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.296
- Honey...
- Again!

04:22.696 --> 04:27.201
Chicken wrap, all white,
no tomato, salsa... extra salsa.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.069
On the side!

04:29.169 --> 04:33.407
- Christ! On the side!
- On the side. I got it, babe.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.043
Morning. Morning, Stacy.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.640
Apparently I'm your number one neighbor.
You got a tough one there, my friend.

04:38.740 --> 04:41.348
Well... Late start for you?

04:41.448 --> 04:43.450
- Nah, I just forgot my shades.
- Oh, there you go.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.387
You know, you got a brake
light out there, Ward.

04:47.273 --> 04:49.267
- Really?
- Yep. Brake light is out.

04:49.367 --> 04:52.125
I'm gonna need to see you
driver's license and registration.

04:52.225 --> 04:55.195
Okay. I got... hold it.
Give me a second.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.330
- Ward.
- Yeah?

04:56.430 --> 05:00.368
I'm kidding. I'm your neighbor.
You have a good day, my friend.

05:02.752 --> 05:05.072
- Thanks, Bruce.
- Yeah!

05:06.288 --> 05:07.441
Hello.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.477
- <i>You know what the fucking problem is?</i>
- Good morning.

05:10.677 --> 05:14.490
Every fucking morning, I spend nearly
$3 for my iced coffee, mind you,

05:14.590 --> 05:17.718
which is the same as the drip, which is
given to you at the counter, where you pay.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.620
But is my iced coffee
given to me at the counter?

05:19.720 --> 05:21.054
I am guessing no.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.923
Do you know how long it takes
to make a blended drink?

05:23.916 --> 05:26.660
- Seven hours.
- Fuck you. A long fucking time.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.227
These people move with
the urgency of a glacier.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.833
Hold on. Hey, you need a hand?

05:32.933 --> 05:34.535
- Oh, I got it.
- You sure?

05:35.235 --> 05:36.670
How's your iced coffee?

05:36.770 --> 05:39.671
- It's the best one yet.
- You like it creamy?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.644
I'll see you tomorrow.

05:43.744 --> 05:46.580
- <i>Who was that?</i>
- The chick that works the counter.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.616
- <i>Wow. You really let her know how you feel.</i>
- Fuck you. She's cute.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.819
She sucks at her job,
but she's fucking cute.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.922
- Hey, are we still on for Sunday?
- <i>Yeah, we better be.</i>

05:55.022 --> 05:57.291
Good. A father's day golf is
just what the doctor ordered.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.026
Of course, I'll spend my day
hitting tour-quality shots

05:59.126 --> 06:02.429
while pussy Ward thins every iron and
somehow manages to end up on the green.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.965
Oh, hey, I'm pulling up to Robin Peters.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.867
- Oh, dude, that's today?
- <i>Yeah. I'll fill you in later.</i>

06:06.967 --> 06:09.668
Wait. Tell her she
sucked in <i>Prairie Girl.</i>

06:15.407 --> 06:18.045
Ms. Peters, I'm so sorry I'm late.
Tom Bradford, <i>Ego</i> magazine.

06:18.245 --> 06:22.916
Mr. Bradford, I've been doing
interviews for over two decades now,

06:23.016 --> 06:26.084
and not once have I had to
wait for the interviewer.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.321
I'm... I'm so sorry I'm late.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.593
You are seven minutes late.

06:35.928 --> 06:38.799
Relax. Sit down.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.602
Thank you.

06:42.787 --> 06:43.837
Hey.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.206
Sorry. We... we were...
we just got a muffin.

06:46.306 --> 06:49.610
We stopped, and the line was...
I've actually never seen a line that long.

06:49.710 --> 06:50.846
- Sure.
- Sorry.

06:50.946 --> 06:54.348
Hey, tootsie. Why don't you go into your
classroom, and we'll be right there, okay?

06:54.448 --> 06:58.285
Go on inside, okay? Go on. Run, run.

06:58.485 --> 07:01.255
- What does that mean, "sure"?
- Nothing.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.924
Can you take Lily this weekend?

07:04.224 --> 07:05.526
You can't do this weekend?

07:05.626 --> 07:07.795
I was just hoping we could
switch weekends is all.

07:07.895 --> 07:11.565
- I mean, if it's a big deal, then...
- No. I can help you out.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.667
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.618
You got a hot date? Or... no? Nothing?

07:16.718 --> 07:19.273
You just... you just wanna be alone?
Get some alone time?

07:19.373 --> 07:22.342
- It's not like a Vegas girl's weekend...
- Can you switch with me or not?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.711
Look, I'm just trying to have
an adult conversation here.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.115
- Is that what this is?
- You're being super defensive, so...

07:28.215 --> 07:31.218
so I guess I'll take that
as you have a new lover.

07:31.518 --> 07:34.454
- I will hit you.
- Oh, that's vile.

07:34.854 --> 07:37.624
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
- Mom!

07:37.724 --> 07:40.027
Hi. I am so sorry.
I don't mean to bother you.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.162
- It's okay.
- Is it okay if I take a picture with you?

07:42.262 --> 07:43.497
- Sure.
- You don't mind?

07:43.597 --> 07:45.766
- No, not at all.
- Would you mind?

07:45.866 --> 07:48.300
- I'm coming in.
- Okay.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.439
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Sure.

07:52.539 --> 07:54.808
I'm just such a huge
fan of <i>West End Medical.</i>

07:54.908 --> 07:56.510
- Oh, yeah?
- I miss Bryce.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.711
- Yeah. Me too.
- So what are you up to now?

08:06.718 --> 08:08.053
Not ripe yet.

08:10.289 --> 08:11.956
Oh, yeah! Oh, shit.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.727
Oh, God.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.863
Oh, God.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.707
Crabgrass?

08:27.707 --> 08:30.811
- Robin Peters.
- Hey! How'd it go?

08:30.911 --> 08:33.145
She is fantastic.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.746
- Really?
- Fantastic.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.817
- The interview, however...
- Why?

08:40.385 --> 08:42.155
A two-time academy award nominee, right?

08:42.255 --> 08:44.425
Couldn't get arrested after <i>Pole Dance.</i>
She claws her way back.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.360
Bit part here, supporting part there.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.929
- Oh, man, but her tits in <i>Brick Layer.</i>
- I know.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.912
I know. Real, I think.
That reminds me. I gotta call Geena.

08:52.012 --> 08:53.900
- Hey, remind me to call Geena.
- All right, boss.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.802
- Okay, so she claws her way back.
- Yes. Right.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.937
And so, this movie now is
getting some real traction.

08:58.037 --> 09:03.074
So I show up and ask her what the readers
of our magazine really wanna know.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.516
- You are cute and easy to talk to.
- Oh, thank you.

09:10.316 --> 09:12.719
- You must be good at your job.
- Oh, please.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.421
Well, you can put me at ease.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.636
- Well, you're easy.
- Am I?

09:17.991 --> 09:20.728
Okay, on that note,
I do have some questions for you.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.664
We have some business.
There's some business we have to attend to.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.967
- Business.
- Business, yes. Very serious stuff here.

09:27.939 --> 09:32.437
All right. Well, the readers of
the magazine would like to know...

09:35.775 --> 09:38.042
What would your readers like to know?

09:40.980 --> 09:44.883
They wanna know about your dog.
About Sloopy.

09:51.056 --> 09:55.894
It's a puggle, right?
Her dog? It's a pug?

10:01.800 --> 10:04.905
You know who it is.
Just give me a second, all right?

10:05.205 --> 10:06.905
Hey, babe.

10:08.307 --> 10:12.377
Around 5:00. So how...
how... how's the baby?

10:14.046 --> 10:17.582
Oh, really. So, look,
what I think you should...

10:18.451 --> 10:21.388
Yeah, you do whatever you think.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.791
At the end of the day, you're the mommy.
Whatever you wanna do.

10:24.191 --> 10:28.129
I love you. Hello? Hello?

10:29.029 --> 10:32.264
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She's...

10:33.007 --> 10:36.169
She's just a little upset 'cause the
baby's cranky, and I'm not around.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.638
- Because you're working.
- Yeah.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.807
But I'm not there for
her and the baby either.

10:40.907 --> 10:44.111
- Because you're at work.
- I know.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.244
Just a really tough time right now.

10:47.646 --> 10:50.818
Maybe you can have Stacy call Geena.
Maybe they can go to the park or something,

10:50.918 --> 10:52.467
get the kids out of the
house for a little while.

10:52.567 --> 10:54.856
Really? That'd be okay with Geena?

10:56.356 --> 11:00.160
Are you kidding? Oh, she'd love that.

11:00.360 --> 11:04.431
Maybe... maybe Sunday
while we're at golf.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.549
You didn't tell her about golf?

11:07.349 --> 11:10.026
I'm gonna. I promise. I am. It's...

11:10.126 --> 11:12.405
It's really rough
right now with the kid.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.244
You know I have a baby, too, right?
David... he's got a kid.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.142
I'll tell her tonight.

11:27.886 --> 11:30.421
Do these go with your pants,
or are they workout gear?

11:34.827 --> 11:37.896
- So pants?
- That's what they are.

11:44.003 --> 11:47.507
Hey, honey? Honey?

11:48.207 --> 11:49.109
What?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.478
So the guys are going
golfing for father's day,

11:51.578 --> 11:54.412
and I was wondering if
I could go with them?

11:57.249 --> 11:59.620
If you don't wanna spend father's
day with your son, that's up to you.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.264
- No, I always wanna spend time with him.
- Obviously you don't, Ward.

12:03.364 --> 12:06.493
You just told me you wanna spend
it with the guys playing golf.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.395
I'm stuck here every day, but...

12:08.495 --> 12:11.231
I'm sure Tom wants to spend
it with his wife and child.

12:11.331 --> 12:16.002
No, babe. Tom's going. Yeah,
it was his idea. He's playing golf.

12:16.102 --> 12:20.707
Don't pass the blame. You're responsible
for your own actions. All right?

12:20.807 --> 12:24.342
Not Tom or Ronnie or any
of your other idiot friends.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.644
How's he doing?

12:29.850 --> 12:32.650
Yeah. He's such a good boy.

12:34.386 --> 12:38.658
Man, if I'm exhausted, you've just
gotta be beat? He's a full-time job.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.892
I'm okay.

12:43.929 --> 12:48.733
- I'm almost back to my pre-baby weight.
- I know, and you look great.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.445
You want a piece of this?

12:54.107 --> 12:57.777
Yeah. Yeah, you know I do.
I'm just so tired, babe.

12:58.377 --> 13:00.811
Come on. I'm so tired.

13:01.547 --> 13:03.648
- Okay?
- Yeah.

13:07.252 --> 13:09.721
- Night.
- Night.

13:28.206 --> 13:30.277
You don't have a
cappuccino machine, do you?

13:30.677 --> 13:34.679
- Big D! What'd you get?
- Wow. You look like a fool.

13:36.949 --> 13:41.988
Hey, can I get a, breakfast Sandy,
no mayo? Reminds me of cum.

13:42.088 --> 13:45.258
You know, make that two,
and a froot loops.

13:46.086 --> 13:47.762
Lily!

13:48.160 --> 13:49.313
Brought your kid?

13:49.413 --> 13:53.591
Yeah. Amanda needed... I don't know.
Something. Whatever.

13:53.991 --> 13:57.270
- You know, I'm not pulling my punches.
- She's heard it all before.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.271
- Oh, I've got some new shit.
- I doubt that.

14:04.776 --> 14:06.146
Yeah. Where you at?

14:06.546 --> 14:09.950
- Hey, man, how's it going?
- You here?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.384
<i>No.</i>

14:11.484 --> 14:14.687
Look, I'm not gonna make it today.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.356
What are you talking about?
It's fucking father's day.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.491
That's the thing.

14:18.591 --> 14:19.632
What a pussy.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.227
Sorry. Christ. Hit another.

14:24.897 --> 14:28.433
She says her relationship
with her father is strained.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.605
- You're hitting three.
- Shut up.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.640
- Dad.
- Sorry, honey.

14:42.547 --> 14:44.651
- Fuck!
- Dad!

14:44.851 --> 14:45.921
Sorry.

14:46.021 --> 14:48.355
You know what? I'm just gonna go ahead
and talk in your back swing from now on

14:48.455 --> 14:50.455
if it doesn't make any difference.

14:51.991 --> 14:55.428
- I mean, do they even talk?
- What's that mean, "strained"?

14:55.528 --> 14:57.996
- I don't know.
- It means he's a fucking pussy.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.404
Tour quality.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.222
She says that father's day

15:06.322 --> 15:10.176
reminds her of how bad her relationship
is with her father, and that she needs him.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.344
- Needs him?
- Yep.

15:11.444 --> 15:15.482
She hates him. She spends her whole
day terrorizing and berating that pussy.

15:15.582 --> 15:19.017
I mean, not that he doesn't
deserve some of it, but fuck.

15:21.186 --> 15:23.089
- Not bad. You'll be okay.
- Yeah.

15:23.489 --> 15:25.723
At least he's laying one.

16:00.859 --> 16:02.929
Did you tell her she
sucked in <i>Prairie Girl?</i>

16:03.029 --> 16:06.766
Yeah, Ronnie, I did. I told Robin
Peters that she sucked in <i>Prairie Girl.</i>

16:07.566 --> 16:09.369
You know what? She's top three for me.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.705
You just put me in a room with her,
I would close that deal so fast.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.575
I met her a couple times.
We used to have the same publicist.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.577
I think last time I saw
her was in a gifting suite.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.313
- What the fuck is that?
- That's my point, Ron.

16:20.413 --> 16:21.815
You'll never close with
somebody like that

16:21.915 --> 16:24.017
because you need a connection,
an introduction.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.819
- Tom, buddy?
- No way. Never.

16:26.919 --> 16:30.790
All right. How about this?
If I sink this putt, it'll happen.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.191
You sink this putt,
I will shit in the cup.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.599
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na... Oh, God.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.435
Hey, I think you owe me some poo.

16:47.839 --> 16:49.774
Is that good?

16:51.877 --> 16:54.725
- Ward. He wants to know who's ahead.
- Radio silence.

16:54.825 --> 16:58.586
- No way. No sac, no scores.
- Daddy, what's a sack?

17:00.439 --> 17:05.724
It's a bag of doughnuts. Ward didn't
show up with the bag of doughnuts, so...

17:05.925 --> 17:08.294
I mean, seriously, Tom, you know,
there's not rocking the boat,

17:08.394 --> 17:10.797
and then there's sacrificing
your entire fucking...

17:10.896 --> 17:12.799
Sorry. Your entire existence.

17:12.898 --> 17:15.667
I get it. Which sometimes has
to occur when you have a kid.

17:15.768 --> 17:21.241
Yeah. Little bit. Christ, we haven't
seen him since the christening.

17:21.840 --> 17:22.742
- What?
- Me neither.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.810
Yeah. He won't let us come over. Germs.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.489
I miss that pussy.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.240
- Daddy.
- I know. I know, honey.

17:31.917 --> 17:35.221
Just... can you go get us some M&M's?

17:35.667 --> 17:37.056
Terrible.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.549
I mean, come on. We joke about it,
right? We joke about it,

17:39.649 --> 17:43.396
but Ward's always been easy to
be bullied. She's a fucking bully!

17:43.496 --> 17:47.439
I mean, ever since she got pregnant,
she's got him. He's fucking trapped.

17:47.539 --> 17:50.568
He called me before the baby was born.
She was, like, four or five months pregnant.

17:50.668 --> 17:55.241
He was in tears. "I'm a horrible husband.
I can't make her happy. I treat her badly."

17:55.341 --> 17:57.044
- What?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.612
Yeah, she's got him believing that
all of her problems stem from him.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.348
How his parents hate her
and all this fucking bullshit.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.815
We should just kill her.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.549
Sure.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.924
But you gotta think about the
kid growing up without a mother.

18:11.024 --> 18:12.391
I wouldn't do that to a kid.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.527
It's better than growing up
with that troll as your mother.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.129
- That's so true.
- That's true.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.431
- Or we could kill him.
- Ramone?

18:18.531 --> 18:20.200
- What?
- Dude.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.434
No, War... you don't kill
a fucking baby. Ward.

18:23.534 --> 18:26.372
I'd do that for him. I'd do that
for him. It's a mercy killing.

18:27.127 --> 18:29.542
Fuck that, because then the
kid's gotta grow up with her.

18:29.642 --> 18:33.146
I wouldn't do that to the kid.
Not even one I'm not allowed to see.

18:33.246 --> 18:37.250
Besides, if Ward's not here, who am
I gonna wreck on the golf course?

18:37.850 --> 18:40.320
- David.
- It's too easy.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.055
Oh, yeah?

18:42.155 --> 18:45.458
- How's being separated?
- Go fuck yourself.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.391
Point made.

18:48.860 --> 18:51.431
There's a theory that
everybody gets one.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.066
- One what?
- One murder.

18:54.166 --> 18:57.270
Okay. How do you do
it and not get caught?

18:57.370 --> 19:02.183
Well, she's got no friends. Mom died.

19:02.383 --> 19:06.277
- Dad doesn't seem to care, I'm sure.
- It's true... no one would miss her.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.319
- What'd you do, eat me for breakfast?
- You should think of murder at every address.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.719
Daddy!

19:17.956 --> 19:20.593
So what's the distance?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.860
I don't know. 180, 190.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.848
I should go pro.

20:01.185 --> 20:04.535
Do you hear that? Do you hear it?

20:30.962 --> 20:33.967
Now that you woke our baby up,
you're gonna get me a foot-long sub.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.202
Double meat, double cheese.

20:36.302 --> 20:39.405
Or are you gonna keep doing nothing for
your family because it's father's day?

20:39.505 --> 20:42.039
Jesus! Are you sick?

20:44.075 --> 20:45.978
- Good times today, boys.
- It was.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.480
- Definitely.
- Lovely.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.494
- I miss our black friend.
- We could kill her, you know?

20:50.594 --> 20:52.952
Sure, buddy. You know what?
That sounds like a plan.

20:53.052 --> 20:56.472
Now that you've been killed off your last
three TV shows and your wife moved out,

20:56.572 --> 20:58.758
you got all the time in
the world to plan it out.

20:58.858 --> 21:02.603
All right. A: that's just a trial separation.
We're just trying to work things out.

21:02.703 --> 21:05.332
Okay. Sure, sure. What's B?

21:08.033 --> 21:09.266
Nobody loves you.

21:22.113 --> 21:23.416
Hey, there he is.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.318
- Hi, Bruce.
- How are ya?

21:25.418 --> 21:28.655
- Good. How are you?
- Good. How was golf?

21:28.755 --> 21:33.092
I didn't make it today. It's father's day,
so I'm gonna spend it with my family.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.895
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
My kids called me earlier.

21:36.895 --> 21:38.197
They're in Arizona, right?

21:38.297 --> 21:40.667
Very good. Scottsdale.
With their mother.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.769
Hey, I was thinking, next time
you guys go hit the links,

21:42.869 --> 21:45.104
maybe I could dust off my clubs
and play a round with you?

21:45.504 --> 21:46.839
- I'll let you know.
- All righty.

21:46.939 --> 21:50.510
You know, I got a badge. I flash that thing,
we're gonna get a hell of a discount.

21:51.110 --> 21:54.278
- Okay.
- All right. I will see you later.

22:00.919 --> 22:04.123
- Good times, man.
- I know.

22:04.223 --> 22:08.427
It's okay to have a life, you know. I mean,
have something outside of your family.

22:08.527 --> 22:11.798
- That balance is important.
- I know. I just wish...

22:11.898 --> 22:15.902
I wish Stacy had something else to
focus on other than just Ramone.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.235
Like a hobby or a friend.
Just something.

22:20.539 --> 22:22.542
- Please.
- She's a dick.

22:22.642 --> 22:25.178
Yes, I know. I know she is.

22:26.078 --> 22:29.947
- I'll need backup.
- Okay. Great idea.

22:32.117 --> 22:33.519
Hey!

22:33.619 --> 22:37.256
- Oh, my God. You look great.
- Who picked this place? The parking sucks!

22:37.356 --> 22:40.827
- Really? I found a spot right away.
- It doesn't seem that full.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.329
Yeah, well, it was full for me,
and he hates elevators,

22:43.429 --> 22:45.863
and the stairs smell like piss, and...

22:46.431 --> 22:48.108
Where's Larry?

22:49.135 --> 22:50.870
Your kid.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.638
Charlie.

22:52.738 --> 22:55.908
I-I thought you said you didn't
want us to bring the kids.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.244
Yeah, like a girls' lunch.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.713
- Should we go home now?
- No.

23:00.813 --> 23:04.014
- No!
- Yes.

23:44.523 --> 23:47.026
And just know, it does
get better every day.

23:47.126 --> 23:50.062
I know everybody
says that, but it's true.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.365
And when they start
to talk, it's so cute.

23:52.465 --> 23:56.200
Yeah, but when they start to talk,
they don't shut up, right?

23:57.936 --> 23:59.639
I... I know for me,

23:59.739 --> 24:03.876
once Charlie started sleeping in his
own room, things got a little better.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.845
Oh, Ramone doesn't
sleep in his own room.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.314
No, the only place he can
fall asleep is here, on me.

24:08.514 --> 24:11.517
Yeah, but then you put him in
his bed after he's asleep, right?

24:11.617 --> 24:14.153
Yeah, so he can wake up and cry? No.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.790
You're not afraid you're gonna roll
over on him in his sleep or something?

24:18.190 --> 24:20.492
Some days I wish I would.

24:21.192 --> 24:23.729
I'm kidding. God.

24:24.029 --> 24:26.499
No. Years ago, I trained myself
to be a back sleeper, you know?

24:26.599 --> 24:31.504
'Cause Ward's a spooner, and... I can't
even stand the thought of him touching me.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.940
I miss spooning.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.576
I'm sorry you guys are
having such a tough time.

24:36.676 --> 24:40.380
It's just hard for me to be with someone
who has no direction or no passion.

24:40.480 --> 24:44.350
We don't connect, and... whatever.
It's tough. On me, on Lily.

24:44.450 --> 24:48.721
I know how you feel. I mean,
it's different. We connect. We just...

24:48.821 --> 24:52.592
We don't... have that spark, you know?

24:53.192 --> 24:57.029
- What's that smell? Do we smell that?
- I think it's...

24:57.129 --> 25:01.300
Yeah, it's not me who took the
big dump in his pants, it's Ramone.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.269
- Do you wanna go change him?
- Yeah.

25:03.369 --> 25:06.770
He doesn't mind a dirty diaper.
Unless you do?

25:12.644 --> 25:14.845
- What's up?
- Hey.

25:16.649 --> 25:19.451
- So I've been looking into it.
- Into what?

25:19.551 --> 25:20.987
- What's up, Ken?
- What's up, Ron?

25:21.087 --> 25:23.923
What we were talking
about with Ward's wife.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.125
- I don't know.
- You know.

25:26.225 --> 25:29.895
No, I don't know. If I knew,
I would've said, "oh, yeah, right. I know."

25:29.995 --> 25:33.032
- What the fuck you talking about?
- About killing her.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.999
- Hey, Ashley.
- Hi, Ronnie.

25:37.602 --> 25:41.441
Do you have a fucking wire loose?
We were kidding.

25:41.541 --> 25:45.711
I'm just saying that... that,
the conversation inspired me.

25:45.811 --> 25:49.348
That kind of shit fascinates me, you know?
The mind of a serial killer.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.451
- Bro, she's an asshole, right?
- Yeah.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.121
Yeah. And when people are assholes,
we talk about wanting them dead,

25:55.221 --> 25:58.024
but we don't actually
want them fucking dead.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.226
What the fuck is wrong with you?

26:00.626 --> 26:01.927
- Hey, Tina.
- Hi, Ron.

26:02.127 --> 26:05.565
- Do you know everyone here? Is that...
- How do you think I make a living?

26:05.665 --> 26:08.868
I train all these people.
I'm at work right now, bro.

26:08.968 --> 26:12.805
- You train all these people?
- Not yet. That's how it starts.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.474
I do a couple push-ups,
I sit here in a beater.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.044
They're like, "Oh, hey, hi.
You're a trainer?

26:18.144 --> 26:21.618
Oh, my God, I'm so fat. I totally
needed a trainer." Next thing you know,

26:21.718 --> 26:25.883
they're paying me two hundo an hour to
basically teabag them while they bench press.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.322
And there's something wrong with me?

26:30.422 --> 26:33.859
Hey, man, I'm a pervert. I'm not talking
about trying to fucking kill somebody.

26:33.959 --> 26:37.563
Oh, shit. It's not like
I'd do it. It just...

26:37.663 --> 26:42.366
it's just interesting to think about
how you'd get away with it.

26:43.968 --> 26:45.805
That's all.

27:01.220 --> 27:04.356
- Hi, daddy.
- Hello. Hello.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.792
Can you believe it?
Like, it's been a year. It's crazy.

27:06.892 --> 27:10.697
I know. It's crazy, right?
It's like he was born last week.

27:11.697 --> 27:15.000
Time flies when you're not stuck
at home every day for the baby.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.303
Yeah, but... but it's fun.

27:17.403 --> 27:21.905
Sure. We have fun when daddy
abandons us. Right? We have fun.

27:23.842 --> 27:26.021
- What's wrong with you? Are you sick?
- No, I'm fine.

27:26.121 --> 27:29.014
- You make my baby sick, and...
- I'm not sick.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.984
It's cake time, Ward. Wrap it up.

27:32.784 --> 27:34.220
It's cake time, guys, so...

27:34.320 --> 27:35.988
- Dude, what the hell?
- What?

27:36.088 --> 27:39.058
She's just worried about
the baby, that's all.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.828
- Howdy, neighbor.
- Hey, Bruce, how's it going?

27:41.928 --> 27:43.362
- Good.
- Thank you for coming.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.264
- Thank you for having me.
- Yeah.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.233
- I'm sorry. Tom.
- Good to see you, man.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.634
- Hey, guys. How are you?
- Ronnie.

27:48.734 --> 27:51.536
- You met Geena, right?
- Yes, yes. Good to see you.

27:51.636 --> 27:53.906
Ward keeps threatening to
take me golfing with you guys.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.342
- Next time you go out, let me know.
- Yeah. We'll do that.

27:56.642 --> 27:57.977
I play from the tips.

27:58.831 --> 27:59.979
Okay.

28:02.147 --> 28:05.284
Yeah, yeah. Cake time.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.653
Stop it. It's half a Benadryl.
He'll be fine.

28:07.753 --> 28:09.655
- I understand that.
- I've done it before. He'll be fine.

28:09.755 --> 28:11.989
I just don't think it's really...

28:13.291 --> 28:14.858
Tom?

28:17.563 --> 28:18.931
- Hello?
- <i>Is this Tom?</i>

28:19.031 --> 28:20.633
- Speaking.
- <i>Hey.</i>

28:20.733 --> 28:22.535
- Hey.
- <i>You don't know who this is.</i>

28:22.635 --> 28:23.936
No, I'm sorry. I don't.

28:24.036 --> 28:28.174
<i>Well, we had a really nice meal
together a little while ago,</i>

28:28.274 --> 28:32.945
the result of which was a fairly
bland article in your magazine.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.647
Yeah, of course. It's work.

28:39.984 --> 28:42.454
- Robin? Robin Peters?
- Am I interrupting something?

28:42.554 --> 28:45.725
No, you're not interrupting anything.
Hi. How are you?

28:45.825 --> 28:48.594
A little out of my
comfort zone, actually.

28:48.694 --> 28:51.330
I was waiting for you to call me,

28:51.430 --> 28:55.201
- and when the call never came...
- Well, I-I...

28:55.501 --> 28:57.636
I thought that we had a
really nice time together.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.673
We did have a nice time.
Yeah, I enjoyed it.

29:00.773 --> 29:03.909
- <i>You enjoyed it?</i>
- I really liked it, actually.

29:04.009 --> 29:06.912
Did you think about it afterwards?

29:07.412 --> 29:09.782
Of course. Yeah. I mean...

29:09.882 --> 29:15.120
- I thought that we made a real connection.
- Yeah. I felt it. The connection.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.022
Well, I think we should
see each other again.

29:17.222 --> 29:19.825
I'd like that... to see you again, yeah.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.828
<i>Maybe for a more in-depth interview?</i>

29:22.928 --> 29:25.097
Definitely. Something deeper.

29:25.197 --> 29:28.234
<i>This is my cell. Call me on Tuesday.</i>

29:28.334 --> 29:30.703
Okay. I will. I'll...
I'll call you Tuesday.

29:30.803 --> 29:33.337
- <i>Good-bye, Tom.</i>
- Good-bye.

29:34.305 --> 29:38.211
- You got a hot date, Tom?
- You scared the shit out of me.

29:40.207 --> 29:41.313
I'm sorry. What'd you say?

29:41.413 --> 29:45.452
- A hot date. Tuesday, was it?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

29:46.752 --> 29:50.456
I wouldn't blame you. I never thought
you and Geena would make it, you know.

29:50.556 --> 29:53.325
She's too, boring and desperate.

29:53.425 --> 29:58.096
- Not that those are bad qualities, but...
- Okay. Time out. That was work.

29:59.172 --> 30:02.101
You're just different.
Not good different.

30:02.201 --> 30:05.405
Not like me and Ward.
We're good different. We make it work.

30:05.505 --> 30:08.173
But, you know, maybe that's
because he's not a cheater.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.911
Ward's too much of a pussy to be
a cheater. But what do I know?

30:12.311 --> 30:14.814
I never thought you
were a cheater either.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.415
Okay. Thank you.

30:16.515 --> 30:19.018
Listen. Come here. Come here.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.486
Look...

30:20.586 --> 30:22.788
I thought about cheating too.

30:22.888 --> 30:27.126
And you know what?
Maybe I've already done it.

30:27.226 --> 30:31.530
It's fun, right? Secret phone calls...

30:31.630 --> 30:34.564
"I'll see you Tuesday"...

30:35.533 --> 30:37.737
We're a lot alike.

30:37.837 --> 30:42.607
You and me, Tom... we could
do it now. We could cheat now.

30:44.809 --> 30:48.882
Maybe... maybe there's some
advantages to being with people as naive,

30:48.982 --> 30:53.285
stupid as Geena and my little Ward.

30:53.885 --> 30:56.086
I wonder what Geena would
think of that phone call.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.161
What the fuck?

31:08.900 --> 31:10.636
Fuck.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.472
Oh, fuck.

31:24.015 --> 31:25.618
Okay.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.718
Okay.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.898
Oh, shit.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.701
Oh, shit.

32:20.638 --> 32:24.243
Okay. Okay.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.376
Oh, shit.

32:31.349 --> 32:34.051
Okay. Okay.

32:37.688 --> 32:39.591
Let me ask you a question...

32:39.691 --> 32:42.127
- That was quite a call.
- Yeah.

32:42.227 --> 32:44.363
Your wife says you're
almost out of diapers.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.265
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.500
Okay. You guys will be here
when I get back, right?

32:48.600 --> 32:50.970
- You know I will be.
- We should probably get going.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.404
Yeah. We'll be here. We'll be here.

32:52.504 --> 32:55.405
- All right. See you in a sec.
- Yep.

32:57.575 --> 33:00.512
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.946
- You're lying.
- Big-time.

33:04.049 --> 33:05.952
I just wanted to mash her
face in the cake, you know?

33:06.052 --> 33:08.587
But then she slipped, and...
I don't know.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.589
- Tom!
- Holy shit, dude.

33:10.689 --> 33:12.291
- Yeah, I know.
- She's dead?

33:12.391 --> 33:13.859
Yeah.

33:13.959 --> 33:16.244
But... but it was an
accident, right? I mean...

33:16.344 --> 33:19.398
Wait. Is that icing on her neck?

33:19.598 --> 33:22.820
Well, yeah. She was bleeding all over,
and she still had a pulse, so I...

33:22.920 --> 33:25.270
So you strangled her?

33:25.570 --> 33:28.271
I don't know. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah.

33:30.475 --> 33:34.580
I think she's probably put on six or
seven pounds since I saw her last.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.773
No, I think that's just the cake...

33:36.873 --> 33:40.652
- No, I... I thought that earlier.
- ...on her face.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.855
So what do we do?

33:42.955 --> 33:47.259
Well, we could've called 911 and said she
slipped but now that you strangled her...

33:47.359 --> 33:50.195
No. I couldn't risk her waking up and
saying I smashed her face in the cake.

33:50.295 --> 33:53.432
- No, I know. I know that.
- They'd know that she was strangled?

33:53.532 --> 33:56.135
Yeah. Look at her neck.
That'll tell everything.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.637
- I'm an idiot. Fuck!
- Hey.

33:58.737 --> 34:01.206
- So I'm sorry...
- Can we just focus for a second, please?

34:01.306 --> 34:03.175
My best friend's dead wife
is lying in a pool of blood,

34:03.275 --> 34:05.611
covered with cake on his kitchen floor!

34:05.711 --> 34:09.281
I got diapers! Got the last pack.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.215
Hey, man.

34:21.192 --> 34:23.129
You?

34:23.629 --> 34:25.089
No.

34:28.866 --> 34:30.373
Yeah.

34:32.637 --> 34:34.938
Dude, we didn't need diapers.

34:36.541 --> 34:39.275
- Where's Ramone?
- Fuck!

34:40.645 --> 34:43.248
You killed my wife,
and you left my baby outside?

34:43.447 --> 34:47.516
- I did not leave your kid outside.
- Oh, my God!

34:48.485 --> 34:50.889
I'll take a look.

34:51.789 --> 34:53.822
I know what to do.

35:00.597 --> 35:02.698
We're in the kitchen!

35:05.036 --> 35:06.134
What?

35:06.234 --> 35:08.026
- Holy shit!
- I know.

35:08.226 --> 35:10.275
- Jesus!
- Right?

35:10.575 --> 35:13.879
- She dead?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

35:15.213 --> 35:16.448
Your hair looks great!

35:16.548 --> 35:20.219
- You like it? I'm not sure.
- Yeah! Really great.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.424
All right, we need your help.

35:26.957 --> 35:28.360
Okay.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.194
This is crazy.

35:32.530 --> 35:35.534
Anyway... when I was researching
how to dispose of her body,

35:35.634 --> 35:38.303
I came up with a bunch
of possible solutions.

35:38.403 --> 35:40.039
- When?
- What?

35:40.139 --> 35:43.340
When were you researching
how to dispose of her body?

35:46.611 --> 35:47.832
Just when Ron called.

35:47.932 --> 35:51.283
No. No. You didn't know she
was dead when he called.

35:51.383 --> 35:54.686
I-I knew that... I knew that...

35:55.486 --> 35:57.889
Not her... body. Not your lovely wife.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.459
I... that's what was so
crazy about all this,

36:00.559 --> 36:03.362
is I... have been
doing all this research

36:03.462 --> 36:06.196
about how to get away with murder.
For a role that I'm preparing for.

36:08.532 --> 36:09.935
You guys planned this.

36:10.035 --> 36:13.905
No, I never intended to
kill your wife. I did not.

36:14.005 --> 36:18.176
We had talked not seriously about
Stacy dying, about killing her.

36:18.276 --> 36:19.444
- You serious?
- Gross!

36:19.544 --> 36:22.514
- Fuck, dude, shut up!
- Well, we had. We had talked about it.

36:22.614 --> 36:26.085
- What the fuck?
- Look, I...

36:26.185 --> 36:29.054
No, it's... I'm sor...

36:29.154 --> 36:32.601
We were passing time on the golf course.
It wasn't serious! It was guys talking.

36:32.901 --> 36:37.362
Obviously, it was serious.
Because fucking Harvey Keitel here has...

36:38.251 --> 36:41.272
- Thank you.
- ...researched and compiled what...

36:41.372 --> 36:46.571
What is this? Three pages of copious
notes on how to kill my wife?

36:46.671 --> 36:48.774
Not how to kill your wife.
How to dispose of her body.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.096
- That's completely different!
- Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

36:53.511 --> 36:56.782
I'm sorry that we...
we talked about killing your wife.

36:56.882 --> 37:00.052
- Even as a joke, it's not cool.
- Yeah.

37:00.352 --> 37:03.019
- Yeah, me too.
- Right.

37:06.490 --> 37:10.762
Okay, let's get started. I got a few options.
A few different ways of doing this.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.698
Of course I have my favorite,
but I think ultimately

37:12.798 --> 37:15.534
this is a decision that we
should come to as a group.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.599
- Agreed.
- If it's cool with Ward?

37:17.699 --> 37:19.126
Sure. Why not? Fuck it.

37:19.226 --> 37:23.709
Beautiful! There is the basic burial method.
Either whole or dismembered.

37:23.809 --> 37:28.146
We take the body to a remote location,
dig a hole, or holes, and bury this bitch.

37:29.803 --> 37:31.049
I'm sorry.

37:33.187 --> 37:36.588
If we do choose this way, it is better
to dismember the body into six pieces.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.857
We want to go head, torso, four limbs,

37:38.957 --> 37:41.360
put each in a garbage bag,
fill them with bleach.

37:41.560 --> 37:46.098
Now, the bleach not only disguises any
scent for any wandering animals, or...

37:46.198 --> 37:50.535
or search parties, but it also begins
the breakdown process of the flesh.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.216
Okay, then we just...
we just go to different locations,

37:54.316 --> 37:57.172
- and we just bury her there.
- That makes sense.

37:57.272 --> 38:00.467
- I think so.
- Yeah, that sounds about right. But...

38:00.567 --> 38:05.250
What about DNA? What about... what about
dental records? What about fingerprints?

38:05.350 --> 38:08.053
- Good question!
- Thank you.

38:08.153 --> 38:10.522
Regardless of any method,
and I got a few more,

38:10.622 --> 38:13.415
we want to cut off and burn the tips
of her fingers, pull out her teeth...

38:13.515 --> 38:16.094
if we can't pull them out,
grind them all the way down.

38:16.194 --> 38:18.630
We just want to get rid
of any easy identifiers.

38:18.730 --> 38:19.848
What about her face?

38:19.948 --> 38:22.148
That too. We got to make
it totally unrecognizable.

38:22.260 --> 38:25.170
- All right.
- I'm gonna need some more wine.

38:25.370 --> 38:27.706
- Will you get wine?
- Yeah.

38:27.806 --> 38:31.109
I'm just gonna keep going.
Here's the guy Ritchie method. Now.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.446
I looked this up, and I couldn't really
find any concrete documentation on it,

38:34.546 --> 38:37.949
but it sounds really cool.
Having her eaten by pigs.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.587
Now we'd have to get her weight right

38:41.687 --> 38:44.523
so that I can get the
appropriate number of swine.

38:44.623 --> 38:47.191
Well, did you know what she weighed?

38:47.586 --> 38:49.894
Between 133 and 134.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.898
- That is way low!
- Yeah, way low.

38:53.398 --> 38:56.501
- Women are brutal.
- We don't have any fucking pigs.

38:56.601 --> 39:00.372
I know. That's why there's the ocean.
We weigh her down, take her out to sea.

39:00.472 --> 39:03.074
Now, you do run the risk
of her washing ashore

39:03.174 --> 39:05.744
unless you just jam her into an oil
drum and just pack it with concrete.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.780
- Yeah, but we don't have a boat.
- We can always rent a boat.

39:07.880 --> 39:12.356
- I'd love to go on a boat.
- Me, too. A cruise.

39:12.456 --> 39:13.218
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:13.318 --> 39:15.053
What, and then at some point
we just tell the captain,

39:15.153 --> 39:18.557
"Hey, can you stop for a second while
we just drop some shit overboard?"

39:19.821 --> 39:22.830
What we could do is chop
her up into tiny pieces,

39:22.930 --> 39:25.251
and throw her over bit by bit.
He'd never see that.

39:25.351 --> 39:27.359
- What, like Chum?
- Yeah. It'd be like <i>Shawshank,</i>

39:27.459 --> 39:30.687
when... when Andy would take
pieces from his cell wall

39:30.787 --> 39:33.339
- and sprinkle 'em in the yard.
- I love that movie.

39:33.439 --> 39:35.540
You know? There's no women in
that movie. Isn't that weird?

39:36.240 --> 39:38.343
We could go big and do a wood chipper.

39:38.443 --> 39:40.745
- <i>Fargo!</i>
- Oh, I love that movie, too.

39:40.945 --> 39:44.383
I mean, you shove her right into the teeth,
it's almost impossible to trace.

39:44.483 --> 39:48.180
Yeah, but well, no. You could trace the
wood chipper through the rental, though.

39:48.280 --> 39:52.391
Yeah. You would have to use cash,
use a fake name or a disguise.

39:52.491 --> 39:55.494
- That's a pain in the ass.
- It is.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.381
Oh! This is good. All right.

39:57.481 --> 40:00.049
Now, depending on what type of
equipment you've got here in the house,

40:01.049 --> 40:02.585
we could...

40:02.685 --> 40:05.871
grind her almost completely down.

40:05.971 --> 40:08.407
Like just, send her on down the sewer.

40:08.507 --> 40:11.343
Right down into the drain.
It's gonna take a little longer.

40:11.443 --> 40:13.878
You do run the risk of alerting
the neighbors to the noise,

40:14.578 --> 40:17.749
of the machinery, or the smell...

40:17.849 --> 40:19.882
but, we would keep it all in the house.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.120
- You don't like that one.
- No.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.689
- He doesn't like that.
- All right.

40:24.789 --> 40:25.736
Is that it?

40:25.836 --> 40:28.470
I mean, unless anybody knows anyone
with access to an incinerator.

40:28.770 --> 40:30.161
No, I don't.

40:30.461 --> 40:32.497
I... no.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.608
Well, then, that's it.

40:34.908 --> 40:38.778
I am partial to dismembering and burying.
I think it's the easiest,

40:38.878 --> 40:42.941
especially if we separate the pieces.
It will just be the hardest to trace.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.409
I agree. I agree. Ladies?

40:44.509 --> 40:46.111
- Go with the first choice.
- Oh, good.

40:46.211 --> 40:48.713
- Ward?
- Yeah. Totally agree.

40:48.813 --> 40:52.317
- We should chop her up and bury her.
- Great. That's what I wanted to hear. Okay.

40:52.417 --> 40:55.487
So tomorrow we're gonna
reconvene here before golf...

40:55.587 --> 40:58.223
- Wait.
- You're playing golf tomorrow?

40:58.323 --> 41:01.960
We have a 3:00 tee time.
Everything needs to appear completely normal

41:02.060 --> 41:05.797
so that when we alert the police to
the fact that Stacy's disappeared,

41:05.897 --> 41:08.033
we'll have no questions.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.735
I can't remember the last time
I played golf with these guys.

41:10.835 --> 41:13.338
- It is gonna be fun.
- Cool.

41:13.438 --> 41:15.507
Right, now Tom, you go buy some bleach.

41:15.607 --> 41:19.144
The more the better. Pay with
cash and throw away the receipt.

41:19.344 --> 41:22.548
We'll move Stacy into the bathtub,
bleed her out, then clean this place up.

41:22.648 --> 41:26.351
Tomorrow we'll cut her up and bag
her before golf. You ladies will do...

41:26.451 --> 41:30.068
whatever it is that you do while
we're at golf. We'll each take a bag.

41:31.222 --> 41:33.759
Fuck! Get me out! Fuck!

41:33.859 --> 41:35.325
Get me up!

41:36.295 --> 41:38.327
Fuck, man!

41:39.396 --> 41:41.209
I'm out of shape.

41:46.151 --> 41:48.607
- I'll rinse these.
- Okay.

41:49.136 --> 41:50.473
Kitchen.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.751
Got to make sure there's no
trace of anything in there.

41:59.851 --> 42:03.221
Got to get on our knees,
scrub-a-dub-dub.

42:03.321 --> 42:07.423
No blood, no anything that could
point a finger in our direction.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.697
Just keep your eyes
on the task at hand...

42:12.897 --> 42:14.831
and you should be golden.

42:27.944 --> 42:29.281
Looks pretty great!

42:29.381 --> 42:32.958
Definitely doesn't look like somebody
was killed in here, that's for sure.

42:34.052 --> 42:37.063
Hey, man. I'm really
sorry I killed your wife.

42:38.656 --> 42:41.426
I know. I know you are.

42:41.526 --> 42:43.195
You guys are like family to me.

42:43.295 --> 42:46.264
- We always have been.
- Ramone, too.

42:46.364 --> 42:48.431
We love you guys.

42:50.467 --> 42:52.969
I haven't seen your kid in months, man!

42:56.740 --> 42:58.610
There he is.

42:58.710 --> 43:00.276
Yeah.

43:02.313 --> 43:05.617
- He's beautiful.
- So beautiful.

43:05.717 --> 43:09.752
- Thanks.
- So peaceful. So innocent.

43:10.788 --> 43:12.591
- Fuck!
- What?

43:12.691 --> 43:14.826
We forgot to bleed her out.

43:15.526 --> 43:17.226
Come on, come on.

43:26.536 --> 43:28.231
Okay.

43:29.374 --> 43:32.241
Oh. Honey, could you go in the
kitchen and grab me a knife?

43:34.511 --> 43:38.207
Okay, guys, we have to remember that
we need to bury all our clothes in a bag.

43:38.307 --> 43:39.672
What?

43:40.991 --> 43:43.085
I love these shoes.

43:44.855 --> 43:46.825
- This good?
- That's perfect. Thank you.

43:47.653 --> 43:50.301
Yeah. Tom. Take it.

43:50.901 --> 43:56.067
So what I need you to do is,
"cut the thigh diagonally...?"

43:56.167 --> 43:59.070
Now make sure you get deep
enough to hit the femoral artery,

43:59.170 --> 44:02.040
so you gotta go in pretty good.
Give it a good whack.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.042
You can do it, honey.

44:04.142 --> 44:07.310
Come on. You strangled her with your
bare hands, you can cut her fuckin' thigh.

44:10.480 --> 44:14.786
- I thought you said she hit her head.
- She did hit her head. Yes. And then...

44:14.886 --> 44:16.287
I did. I strangled her. Yes.

44:17.360 --> 44:21.457
- What the fuck, Tom?
- I know. I know, I'm so sorry. I am.

44:23.994 --> 44:26.696
Go ahead. Cut her up.

44:30.400 --> 44:32.101
You can do it.

44:35.038 --> 44:37.173
Sorry. Sorry.

44:45.316 --> 44:47.018
- Oh, fuck!
- Yeah.

44:47.118 --> 44:48.987
Yeah, that's not a really sharp knife.

44:49.087 --> 44:52.569
- We don't have a sharpener.
- That's really dangerous, you know?

44:52.669 --> 44:55.226
Dull knives? The number one
cause of injuries in the kitchen.

44:55.326 --> 44:56.759
Okay, be careful, honey.

44:58.662 --> 45:01.308
Okay... okay, I just...

45:03.101 --> 45:04.852
Oh, no!

45:05.770 --> 45:09.040
- I think you got to go deeper.
- That's a big fucking thigh.

45:09.140 --> 45:11.410
Maybe try... try the other one.

45:11.510 --> 45:13.745
Pretty fuckin' deep here, man!

45:14.945 --> 45:19.384
I'm an idiot! I'm a total idiot. We got
to pump it out. Do chest compressions.

45:19.484 --> 45:23.588
Apply suction to the atria using
the spring from the ribcage.

45:24.689 --> 45:26.622
- Okay.
- Yeah.

45:29.126 --> 45:32.032
- Like CPR?
- I think so.

45:36.034 --> 45:39.169
- Harder.
- I'm pushing pretty hard here.

45:39.629 --> 45:40.639
You got to do it harder.

45:40.839 --> 45:43.472
I'm pushing pretty hard here, man.
If you want to give it a shot, be my guest.

45:46.276 --> 45:47.125
Fuck it.

45:50.982 --> 45:52.663
- Jesus!
- That's it.

45:54.565 --> 45:56.462
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

45:58.756 --> 46:00.825
Okay, okay! That's enough,
that's enough!

46:01.025 --> 46:03.626
And that's how you bleed a body out!

46:11.468 --> 46:13.939
All right. Tomorrow mo...

46:14.339 --> 46:15.974
- What?
- Who the fuck is that?

46:16.174 --> 46:18.978
Hide. Hide! Come on.

46:19.878 --> 46:22.818
- Go! Hide, hide!
- They can see the fireplace.

46:27.451 --> 46:29.187
Hey, Ward, it's Bruce!

46:29.287 --> 46:30.689
- Ward!
- What?

46:30.789 --> 46:34.490
- Get the door. Deal with it.
- Yeah.

46:42.432 --> 46:44.970
- Hey, Ward!
- Hey, Bruce.

46:45.270 --> 46:47.138
- Hey, buddy. How are you?
- I'm great.

46:48.062 --> 46:49.137
What's goin' on?

46:50.174 --> 46:53.511
- Oh, I was getting ready for bed.
- Oh. Okay.

46:53.611 --> 46:57.215
I believe that I left my shades
in your backyard earlier.

46:57.315 --> 46:59.984
I was gonna go around
myself and, check it out,

47:00.084 --> 47:02.120
- but trespassing is illegal, so...
- Yeah, it is.

47:02.220 --> 47:05.089
I thought I'd knock. All right?
So if you wouldn't mind...

47:05.189 --> 47:09.019
- You want to go through the house?
- Well, that's how you get to the back yard.

47:10.161 --> 47:11.390
Right.

47:12.579 --> 47:16.635
- What's goin' on? You okay?
- Everything's fine. Look...

47:17.535 --> 47:19.163
What was that?

47:24.374 --> 47:26.277
- Nothing.
- Okay.

47:26.377 --> 47:28.713
You should probably go
around the side of the house.

47:28.813 --> 47:32.050
Around the side?
What's going on? You okay?

47:32.150 --> 47:35.019
Everything's fine. It's just that
Ramone is sleeping right now.

47:35.119 --> 47:38.856
And Stacy gets really weird when
I have company while he's asleep.

47:38.956 --> 47:40.558
She doesn't want anybody
to come in the house.

47:40.658 --> 47:42.994
I get that. Right. I understand.

47:44.140 --> 47:45.797
We're playing golf tomorrow.

47:45.897 --> 47:48.978
- Yeah?
- I was wondering if you were interested.

47:49.467 --> 47:52.494
Yes. Yes! I would love
to join you. Absolutely!

47:52.594 --> 47:54.439
Are you kidding me?
I could dust off the old clubs.

47:55.092 --> 47:59.110
- That would be great!
- Okay? So, tee time is 3:00.

47:59.210 --> 48:00.545
- 3:00 p.m.
- 3:00 p.m.

48:00.645 --> 48:02.969
Right. So you could come back tomorrow.

48:03.069 --> 48:04.582
- Great. 3:00 p.m.
- Okay.

48:04.682 --> 48:06.241
And I didn't see your
shades around back,

48:06.341 --> 48:08.784
but you're more than welcome to look.
I just need you to go around.

48:08.984 --> 48:11.622
Okay. I'll do that. Hey, you know,
I play from the tips.

48:12.222 --> 48:15.326
- That's wonderful.
- From the tips! Okay.

48:22.065 --> 48:24.233
Oh, shit. Blinds.

48:40.217 --> 48:42.020
Holy shit!

48:42.120 --> 48:43.488
- Dude, what the fuck?
- What?

48:43.588 --> 48:45.156
You invited him to play golf?

48:45.256 --> 48:48.259
What was I supposed to do?
I'm sorry. I panicked. I panicked!

48:48.359 --> 48:52.324
It's fine. We'll deal with
him tomorrow. Be here, 9:30.

48:52.424 --> 48:54.897
We'll finish the job, we play golf.

48:58.235 --> 49:00.302
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Yeah.

49:01.838 --> 49:03.272
I got it.

49:18.088 --> 49:20.444
I don't blame you, you know.

49:21.292 --> 49:22.711
No?

49:24.796 --> 49:28.330
I wanted to just mush her fucking
face in that cake all day long.

49:30.567 --> 49:32.237
What did it feel like?

49:32.837 --> 49:34.628
I don't know.

49:35.473 --> 49:38.774
I mean, I was nervous. But...

49:41.846 --> 49:44.221
Did it feel good?

49:46.550 --> 49:48.753
I watched you today.

49:48.853 --> 49:51.253
What do you mean? When?

49:52.122 --> 49:54.259
You were cleaning in the kitchen.

49:54.359 --> 49:57.128
With your hands on your knees.

49:57.228 --> 49:59.361
And your jeans were
pulling around your...

50:00.931 --> 50:02.975
Around my pussy?

50:04.102 --> 50:05.717
Yeah.

50:06.371 --> 50:09.671
- That's hot.
- It was hot.

50:12.609 --> 50:16.412
You talked about putting
your hands around her neck.

50:17.447 --> 50:19.756
I got jealous...

50:20.951 --> 50:24.200
- And wet.
- Really?

50:33.429 --> 50:34.565
Really?

50:34.665 --> 50:36.865
You said pussy, and I
went hard in a second.

50:39.937 --> 50:41.903
Oh, God!

50:49.646 --> 50:51.981
Squeeze...

50:59.188 --> 51:03.094
I was impressed.
You took control of that situation,

51:03.194 --> 51:05.830
and things could have
gotten really hysterical,

51:05.930 --> 51:08.266
but they didn't, and it just...

51:08.366 --> 51:10.699
<i>You did good.</i>

51:11.668 --> 51:13.035
Lily asleep?

51:14.371 --> 51:18.112
She's right here, next to me. Bad dream.

51:19.143 --> 51:21.812
<i>You don't mind taking her
while I golf tomorrow?</i>

51:21.912 --> 51:24.781
- Of course.
- And maybe afterwards,

51:24.881 --> 51:29.385
we could take Lily to a mini-golf.
With all of us.

51:30.854 --> 51:31.956
Maybe.

51:32.456 --> 51:34.458
<i>I should get to bed.</i>

51:34.858 --> 51:36.356
Good job today.

51:36.556 --> 51:40.398
- Thanks. Good night.
- Good night.

53:12.245 --> 53:14.722
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:15.458 --> 53:17.662
You look like shit. You okay?

53:17.762 --> 53:21.830
I hated her as much as anybody, okay?
But this is way fucked up, you know?

53:22.932 --> 53:24.735
- Yeah.
- Morning!

53:24.835 --> 53:25.869
Morning.

53:28.605 --> 53:31.311
- What's up?
- This is fucked up.

53:32.209 --> 53:34.734
This is way fucked up.

53:36.079 --> 53:37.815
It is. It's totally fucked up.

53:37.915 --> 53:40.551
- And hey, it's all my fault.
- Yeah, no shit.

53:40.651 --> 53:43.554
But look. After today, it's done.
Right? Right?

53:43.654 --> 53:46.190
Right. Right! Done.

53:46.290 --> 53:49.093
And I feel horrible.
I mean, look, I never wanted...

53:49.193 --> 53:52.196
Well, I wanted to, but...

53:52.296 --> 53:54.290
He feels really bad.

53:55.165 --> 53:57.868
- You do?
- I do. Yeah.

53:58.268 --> 53:59.999
Me too.

54:00.504 --> 54:01.770
I feel really bad.

54:03.340 --> 54:05.132
I know you do.

54:06.277 --> 54:08.110
Let's go cut her up.

54:09.913 --> 54:11.509
Come on!

54:16.052 --> 54:18.756
- Hello?
- Hey, we're in here, guys.

54:19.156 --> 54:21.325
Good morning. How was the night?

54:21.425 --> 54:24.529
Slept till seven! Pretty impressive.

54:27.461 --> 54:31.144
Just finished our first egg, and...
Where's Amanda?

54:31.244 --> 54:34.372
She's with Lily. She didn't
want to bring her. You know.

54:34.472 --> 54:37.527
She sends her love,
wishes us all the best.

54:38.075 --> 54:40.578
Listen. We were talking outside.

54:40.678 --> 54:44.849
Yeah, I just... This is really fucked up,
man, you know? It's...

54:44.949 --> 54:47.818
- Really fucked up!
- It is. I mean...

54:47.918 --> 54:50.054
- I killed your wife.
- I know.

54:50.154 --> 54:52.723
And you guys have all been great,
and especially you, Ward.

54:52.823 --> 54:54.858
- Thanks.
- No, thank you.

54:56.053 --> 55:00.498
Stacy and I hooked up, and she
got pregnant, but thank God.

55:00.998 --> 55:04.669
Although I hate his name. Ramone's the
best thing that's ever happened to me.

55:04.769 --> 55:08.305
That name is awful.
It's like a busboy pimp.

55:08.405 --> 55:12.176
- Yeah, it's really bad.
- But it's just a name.

55:12.476 --> 55:14.111
At the end of the day, it's just a name.

55:14.211 --> 55:17.848
And... she was a not-nice person

55:17.948 --> 55:21.118
whose only happiness came
from her being not-nice.

55:21.218 --> 55:26.625
- She was a bad mom, too.
- Yeah. She was selfish, and she was mean.

55:27.325 --> 55:31.467
I'm gonna be honest with you guys.
I'm... I'm glad she's...

55:36.132 --> 55:38.426
I just want to be happy.

55:40.236 --> 55:41.904
Power tools in the garage?

56:10.134 --> 56:11.836
- Really?
- What, what, what?

56:11.936 --> 56:13.738
I snapped a blade.

56:13.838 --> 56:16.638
All right. I got another one in
the garage. I'll be right back.

56:24.881 --> 56:26.915
You ready? Here we go.

56:30.019 --> 56:31.655
Hey, man. How's it goin' in there?

56:31.855 --> 56:35.848
We snapped a blade, but we're
almost done. How's it goin' here?

56:35.948 --> 56:38.060
- It's good.
- All right.

56:47.972 --> 56:50.906
I haven't had a cigarette
in seven years.

56:52.509 --> 56:54.912
I started again last week.

56:55.012 --> 56:58.347
- It's my first one.
- Ever?

57:00.550 --> 57:02.920
I feel like Denzel Washington.

57:03.120 --> 57:06.117
All right, okay, all right...

57:08.891 --> 57:11.095
- That tastes so good.
- Tastes so good.

57:11.195 --> 57:13.629
Do you guys know what that
shit does to your body?

57:14.764 --> 57:16.698
Fuck it, give me one.

57:19.602 --> 57:21.298
Assholes.

57:22.139 --> 57:24.208
So Amanda and I were talking last night.

57:24.835 --> 57:26.041
Yeah?

57:28.878 --> 57:30.532
Yeah.

57:31.214 --> 57:32.614
Good for you guys.

57:35.518 --> 57:36.552
Yeah.

57:38.555 --> 57:39.601
Okay.

57:40.958 --> 57:43.594
Tee time is 3:00, that gives us...

57:43.694 --> 57:48.165
a little over two hours to find a place,
bury the body, get to the course. Right?

57:48.265 --> 57:50.945
We don't tell each other where we're going.
The less each of us knows, the better.

57:51.045 --> 57:52.771
Geena's going to stay with the kids.
Thank you very much.

57:52.871 --> 57:54.841
Ward, when you get home, call the cops.

57:54.941 --> 57:57.474
Say that you came home to find
the baby, but Stacy was gone.

57:57.574 --> 58:00.310
Say that she's been gone a day or
two before, but never without Ramone.

58:00.410 --> 58:02.934
Can't file a missing persons
report for 48 hours. So.

58:03.034 --> 58:04.515
You guys think this is gonna work?

58:04.615 --> 58:06.784
Yeah. They'll just... they'll just
think that she's left for a little bit.

58:06.884 --> 58:09.820
She doesn't come back, you file it,
police won't make any mention of it.

58:09.920 --> 58:12.089
Hey buddy, I can watch
Ramone whenever you need.

58:12.589 --> 58:14.858
Yeah. Me-me too.

58:15.058 --> 58:17.261
- Appreciate it.
- Well, well, well. Howdy, howdy.

58:17.361 --> 58:18.629
Nosey fucker.

58:18.829 --> 58:22.099
You guys are already dressed
for golf. Interesting.

58:22.199 --> 58:24.964
- I thought we weren't leaving till 3:00.
- Yeah, 3:00.

58:25.064 --> 58:27.805
We just... we came by to help
clean up after the party.

58:28.205 --> 58:31.285
Oh, that's right. Yeah, I saw that.

58:33.599 --> 58:36.415
So I was thinking maybe,
I'd grab my clubs,

58:36.515 --> 58:40.752
throw 'em in your trunk, Ward. The two
of us drive together. Why take two cars?

58:41.652 --> 58:44.188
That makes perfect sense,
what with you guys being neighbors.

58:44.288 --> 58:47.858
- That's what I was thinking.
- Yeah. Sure.

58:48.176 --> 58:50.761
I got a couple errands I
need to run, but absolutely.

58:50.861 --> 58:53.564
- 2:30?
- 2:30. Yeah. Sure. 2:30.

58:53.964 --> 58:55.666
- All right. I'll be here.
- See you there.

58:55.766 --> 58:57.267
- See you then.
- Okay.

58:57.367 --> 58:59.203
- From the tip!
- Yeah!

58:59.603 --> 59:01.271
- What the fuck?
- Don't worry about it.

59:01.371 --> 59:03.736
All it means is you gotta double
back and pick him up.

59:04.236 --> 59:06.744
It's fine. Listen to me.
Hey, you'll be fine.

59:07.519 --> 59:08.479
Come here.

59:09.570 --> 59:11.312
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Let's do this.

59:12.682 --> 59:15.450
- You wanna fuck?
- Yeah.

59:17.820 --> 59:19.208
Yeah.

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:23.383
Fuck.

01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:26.059
Fuck!

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:28.323
Fuck!

01:00:29.992 --> 01:00:31.593
Stupid...

01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:35.463
Piece of shit.

01:01:44.866 --> 01:01:48.539
- I like the new you.
- All it took was a murder.

01:01:48.939 --> 01:01:51.247
So where are you gonna bury them?

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:56.678
- I was thinking along the Ridge?
- Good idea.

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:01.714
Hey. See you later.

01:02:02.387 --> 01:02:03.086
Yo.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:05.522
- <i>Did you do yours yet?</i>
- Almost. I...

01:02:05.622 --> 01:02:07.835
- I just remembered. Do you have the head?
- What?

01:02:07.935 --> 01:02:09.177
The head. Do you have the beast's head?

01:02:09.277 --> 01:02:10.962
- We forgot to disfigure it.
- Hold on.

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:19.837
No. I got a torso and an arm. Left arm.

01:02:19.937 --> 01:02:23.875
Shit. All right. Damn it.
I gotta call Ronnie. Get it done.

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:48.866
What?

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:51.335
- <i>Yo, do have the head?</i>
- What?

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:54.571
- <i>The head. Do you have the head?</i>
- I don't fucking know.

01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:59.474
Well, check, all right? We gotta disfigure
the face in case anybody finds it.

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:05.080
<i>What? What's the problem?
Are you crying?</i>

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:08.986
This isn't my responsibility, David.

01:03:09.586 --> 01:03:11.555
<i>This is not my responsibility.</i>

01:03:11.655 --> 01:03:15.025
Okay, look, all right, Ronnie?
Nobody likes this, okay?

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:18.128
But there was a situation here. There was
an accident, kind of, but we can help.

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:21.331
We can help everybody out here.
We can help Tom. We can help Ward.

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:23.469
We can help Ramone, all right?
Just check the bag.

01:03:25.569 --> 01:03:28.305
- <i>Check the fucking bag.</i>
- Okay.

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:31.673
Okay, okay. Okay.

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:50.594
Please, please, David,
don't make me do this.

01:03:50.694 --> 01:03:54.398
<i>Look... Jesus fucking Christ.
Check the fucking bag.</i>

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:56.615
All right. Fuck!

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:07.776
Fuck.

01:04:13.181 --> 01:04:17.132
- Yeah, I have it.
- Okay. All right. Well, you got to...

01:04:17.532 --> 01:04:18.608
you know.

01:04:20.469 --> 01:04:21.091
What?

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.925
You gotta cut her face
off or something, man.

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:27.197
Fuck you!

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:28.899
<i>What do you mean?
You have to do this, Ronnie.</i>

01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:31.101
- No. No, please!
- <i>You have to do this.</i>

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:34.037
- <i>No fucking way, man.</i>
- All right. Where are you?

01:04:34.873 --> 01:04:36.706
God! Fuck! I'm not supposed to say.

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:40.143
No. If you did what you were
supposed to do, then you don't say.

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:43.664
If I have to come finish your fucking job,
then you have to say! Now, where are you?

01:04:43.964 --> 01:04:47.517
- I'm at the Ridge.
- <i>Great. I'm coming.</i>

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:49.651
The Ridge.

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:42.069
No way. I thought for sure
I'd be the only one here.

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:50.021
This is crazy.

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:56.384
You okay? What happened?

01:05:57.353 --> 01:06:00.855
- I can't fucking do this.
- What are you talking about?

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:04.494
What am I talking about?

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:06.830
You killed her.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:11.401
We cut her up into
little fucking pieces.

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:15.071
What... what do you mean,
what am I talking about?

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:17.174
Yeah. Look, I know this sucks, right?
But we gotta do this.

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:21.169
We have to do this now, okay?
You know what? Look, it's all right.

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.981
I'll take yours. You already dug a hole.
I'll just put her in and cover it up.

01:06:24.081 --> 01:06:25.449
- No, you can't.
- Yeah, I can.

01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:28.151
No. It's... it's... it's the head.

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:30.287
All right. Well,
whatever it is, I'll just...

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:33.757
David said you gotta cut the
fucking face off or something.

01:06:33.857 --> 01:06:37.994
Shit. Right. Right. Okay, okay.

01:06:39.648 --> 01:06:40.797
Okay.

01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:43.700
You know what, man?
This is fucking bullshit.

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:46.870
This is all my fault.

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:50.138
I shouldn't have called
David in the first place.

01:06:53.575 --> 01:06:56.713
You should've taken it. For all of us.

01:06:57.213 --> 01:07:01.451
I didn't do this. I didn't...
I-I didn't fucking do this.

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:05.055
- I have a kid, Ron.
- She had a fucking kid, Tom!

01:07:05.155 --> 01:07:07.624
Hey, she wasn't doing the right things.

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:09.959
That kid would be a lot
further along developmentally

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:12.195
if she had been a better mother.

01:07:12.295 --> 01:07:14.531
All right. You don't understand this
because you don't have a kid yet.

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:18.168
But Ramone is almost one,
and he's barely crawling.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.946
- What?
- Yeah. She was still breast-feeding.

01:07:21.046 --> 01:07:24.741
- Exclusively, Ronnie. It's a huge thing.
- What does that even mean?

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:28.045
It means she was a shitty mom, not to
mention the kind of wife she was, all right?

01:07:28.145 --> 01:07:30.547
You said it yourself,
probably more than anyone.

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.799
But you don't do that to somebody, Tom.

01:07:32.899 --> 01:07:35.562
You don't fucking kill somebody
because they're a fucking bitch.

01:07:35.662 --> 01:07:38.519
I mean, that doesn't
make any fucking sense.

01:07:39.788 --> 01:07:41.243
Fuck.

01:07:44.359 --> 01:07:47.564
Is that why you killed her?
'Cause she's a bitch?

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:50.701
No, I didn't...
I didn't kill her because...

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:53.801
That's not it. No.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.948
- Really? You're both here?
- Why'd you kill her?

01:07:59.609 --> 01:08:01.778
Who gives a shit why you killed her?

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:05.915
Everybody wanted her dead. Ward most
of all. What's fucking done is fucking done.

01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:07.949
- This it?
- Yeah.

01:08:10.085 --> 01:08:11.855
All right.

01:08:12.155 --> 01:08:13.988
Oh, here we go.

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:17.727
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Wait for what, dude?

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:20.798
We got a 3:00 tee time. I gotta tell the
starter that we're gonna play as a five-some.

01:08:20.898 --> 01:08:23.332
- I know.
- What...

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:27.252
No fucking way, man.
I am not fucking doing this!

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.706
- No, no. We don't have time for this shit.
- No, he's doing it. You're doing it.

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:32.532
No, just give me the club
and let me beat the bag.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:35.478
No. I killed her.

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:38.814
You cut her up. You came up with
the plan. He hasn't done anything.

01:08:38.915 --> 01:08:40.783
Are you crazy?

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:45.188
I cleaned up blood and fucking cake
for three fucking hours last night!

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:48.189
I'm as much of an
accomplice in this as he is.

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:53.560
He's right, man.
You gotta do it, Ronnie.

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:01.571
I don't know if I can trust you
to keep your mouth shut.

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:04.005
- I got a family, Ron.
- Me too.

01:09:05.607 --> 01:09:08.278
We've been friends for 20 years.

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:10.978
You really think that I'm...

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:19.316
Fine. Give it to me.

01:09:26.261 --> 01:09:28.231
You might wanna turn it
over so you get the...

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:30.531
He knows how to hit a 7 iron.

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:36.238
Fuck!

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:40.075
Oh, no. You gotta... you gotta hit
the bag. Come on. You can do it.

01:09:52.515 --> 01:09:53.621
Okay?

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:57.325
Again, dude.
We really gotta fuck her face up.

01:10:03.231 --> 01:10:04.267
Oh, God.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:06.867
I think it got caught in her mouth.
Just pull it out and do it again.

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:27.891
- That's good, Ronnie. You got it.
- Yeah, that's good.

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:31.228
Ronnie! Ronnie! You're good.

01:10:31.328 --> 01:10:33.269
- Ronnie, you got it. Ronnie?
- No! Fuck!

01:10:33.904 --> 01:10:35.663
That's good.

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:43.338
You owe me.

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:48.117
I owe you.

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:51.871
- That was dramatic.
- Yeah.

01:10:51.971 --> 01:10:53.250
All right. Let's bury
the rest of this shit.

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:57.253
- Yeah. I'll go get the bags from my car.
- You know what? Give me a couple gloves.

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:58.755
- I don't have any gloves.
- Golf gloves.

01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:00.855
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:18.092 --> 01:11:19.160
Hey.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.144
Not a word, you hear me? Not a word.

01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:38.793
We got a real problem here, Ward.

01:11:45.335 --> 01:11:46.928
This is not smart, Ward.

01:11:47.028 --> 01:11:50.005
You are all over this.
Do you understand me?

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:14.063
Look, I get it, right? You had a party.
Your trash was overflowing.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.824
Right? The trash trucks don't
come for three days. I get that.

01:12:16.924 --> 01:12:21.172
But, hey, if somebody wants to look
in here, your name is all over this.

01:12:22.372 --> 01:12:24.305
Is that smart?

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:28.545
It's against the law, Ward.

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:32.315
Ward, if you need to use some cans,
you can use my cans.

01:12:32.415 --> 01:12:33.680
You and your kinky friends.

01:12:35.418 --> 01:12:37.285
Lesson learned?

01:12:40.145 --> 01:12:41.491
Lesson learned.

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:45.059
All right. That's good cake.

01:12:58.775 --> 01:13:01.208
- Oh, yeah.
- That was...

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:04.078
- Money.
- Yeah.

01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:10.520
I'm gonna take a leak.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:13.556
Hey, Ward. Come here.

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:16.139
The fucker followed me! He followed me!

01:13:16.239 --> 01:13:18.133
- I know, I know, I know. I saw him.
- He pulled the bags...

01:13:18.233 --> 01:13:20.163
It's okay. It's okay. Relax. Relax.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:25.057
<i>He was watching us last night when we
left your house. I think he's a pervert.</i>

01:13:25.457 --> 01:13:29.105
<i>I thought he might... I don't know.
But I got to your place early this morning,</i>

01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:32.008
<i>and just in case, I took a
couple of bags from your trash.</i>

01:13:32.108 --> 01:13:34.778
<i>I switched them out.
I put them in your trunk.</i>

01:13:34.878 --> 01:13:37.781
<i>I figured if he tried something,
if he followed one of us,</i>

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:39.849
<i>it'd most likely be you.</i>

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.285
- Where's your phone?
- It's in the cart. I'll go get it.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.318
Tthat's perfect.

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:50.126
Hey, it's me. Yeah. Thanks.

01:13:50.226 --> 01:13:53.035
Hey. I'll see you later.

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:55.350
Who the hell was that?

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:03.838
That's Stacy's ringer.

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.977
Ward! Your phone's ringing!
It's your wife!

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:09.979
Tell him to answer it.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:13.180
Could you answer that for me?
I'll be right out!

01:14:14.995 --> 01:14:15.683
Good.

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.208
Much better.

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:23.526
I told her you'd be right out.
She hung up on me.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:27.130
- Really?
- Yeah. She sounded pissed too.

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:30.297
You got your hands full with that one.

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.179
I snapped a blade.

01:14:57.225 --> 01:14:59.260
There you go. Thanks for doing this.

01:15:02.333 --> 01:15:04.000
Mommy!

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.834
You ready to go eat?

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:16.811
- My ball's back there.
- Sorry.

01:15:21.012 --> 01:15:22.685
Ron hasn't said one word all day.

01:15:22.785 --> 01:15:25.221
- He'll be fine.
- He'll be great.

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:26.621
- Take a little time.
- Yeah.

01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:32.328
Nice.

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:34.161
That's tour quality.

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:38.835
Second best 7 iron he's hit all day.

01:15:41.637 --> 01:15:44.138
- Come on.
- Still hitting!

01:15:45.782 --> 01:15:48.311
Great shot, buddy. Great shot.

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:53.348
Thanks for waiting. I don't think I'm
gonna play from my tips next time.

01:16:01.923 --> 01:16:04.060
When did you, speak to her last?

01:16:05.882 --> 01:16:06.929
Earlier today.

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:10.366
I think I was actually probably
the last person to speak with her.

01:16:10.466 --> 01:16:14.137
I picked up his phone when we were
on the golf course earlier today.

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:18.951
- It was a little after 3:00.
- So you spoke to her this afternoon?

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:21.509
I did.

01:16:37.193 --> 01:16:39.409
I want a cigarette.

01:16:40.069 --> 01:16:41.931
Me too.

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:44.565
I'll go get 'em.

01:16:52.575 --> 01:16:54.576
You look fucking great.

01:17:00.318 --> 01:17:01.851
Okay, just keep your shoulders...

01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:04.754
Move your shoulders back.
Hit is straight. Go.

01:17:04.854 --> 01:17:06.389
- Hit it. Hit it.
- Hard. Go.

01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:07.890
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:09.692
- Yeah!
- That was awesome.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:11.527
- See?
- Wait.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.262
Give me five. Give me ten.

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:19.900
- You're not gonna give me a lesson?
- Sure.

01:17:25.373 --> 01:17:30.412
- Yeah.
- You need to... keep your body still.

01:17:32.949 --> 01:17:35.084
You guys! Mom, just hit.

01:17:35.184 --> 01:17:38.121
- Okay, okay.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just hit, just hit.

01:17:38.782 --> 01:17:41.631
- Yes! Did you see that?
- No, we missed it.

01:17:41.731 --> 01:17:44.058
- I did it.
- I don't believe you.

01:18:30.139 --> 01:18:31.994
There you go.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:34.076
Thank you.

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:44.045
Miss Peters?

01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:50.324
Hi.

01:18:51.659 --> 01:18:53.062
- May I?
- Please.

01:18:53.162 --> 01:18:55.062
Thank you.
