    a test screening can be.

     that word properly, johnny.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.651
  - really?                     
  - whatever.  just pray this   
    test screening goes well.   

03:39.686 --> 03:42.271
 'cause charlie really needs it 
  and so does the murphy group.

    do that cameo they

                  unbelievable. 

11:23.082 --> 11:25.083
        jamie:                  
        well, you deserve       
        everything.             

11:26.402 --> 11:28.103
  why do you guys think         
  I'm such a loser?             

11:28.137 --> 11:30.205
        loser?  what are you    
        talking about?          

11:30.239 --> 11:31.773
        I knew you              
        didn't have a car.      

11:31.807 --> 11:33.625
    - I can buy my own car.     
    - how?                      

11:37.279 --> 11:39.647
         but I thought          
         you'd really like it.  

11:39.665 --> 11:41.482
  I do like it.                 
  of course I like it.          

11:41.500 --> 11:43.651
             then enjoy it.     

11:43.669 --> 11:45.587
        come on, you want       
        to take me for a spin?  

11:45.621 --> 11:49.157
yeah.                           
there's something               
I got to do real quick.         

11:49.175 --> 11:51.009
can I drop you at home          
and then see you at dinner?     

11:51.043 --> 11:52.811
         - yeah, sure.          
         - okay.                

11:54.847 --> 11:57.248
 enjoy your new car.            

11:58.918 --> 12:01.636
            yo, e, it's vince.  
            I haven't heard     
            from you all day    

12:01.670 --> 12:03.888
and charlie called.             
where you at?  call me.         

12:03.923 --> 12:05.507
                no answer.      

12:05.541 --> 12:08.309
        ( phone ringing )       

12:08.344 --> 12:10.895
            oh, jeez.           

12:10.930 --> 12:13.348
            ( sighs )           

12:13.382 --> 12:17.185
renoir, man.                    
today is your lucky day.        

12:17.203 --> 12:19.287
i'm parting with one            
of my favorite decks.           

12:19.321 --> 12:22.524
     - <i>giving grassers</i>          
      <i> first shot at it.</i>        
     - <i>let me check it out.</i>     

12:22.558 --> 12:24.743
                      hello?    
                      eric.     

12:24.794 --> 12:26.795
            you scared the shit 
            out of me.          

12:26.829 --> 12:28.747
me too.                         
what are you                    
still doing here?               

12:28.798 --> 12:32.133
         oh, I'm sorry.         
your bed was just so comfortable
     I didn't want to leave.    

12:32.168 --> 12:33.902
     oh, it's 3:00.             

12:33.936 --> 12:36.104
        I didn't know you had   
        a check-out time.       

12:36.138 --> 12:37.872
    - no, I don't.  I just--    
    - I can go.                 

12:37.907 --> 12:39.774
      no, it's okay.            
      I'm just gonna watch      
      the pilot again.          

12:39.809 --> 12:41.910
    oh, did you get any word    
    on the screening?           

12:41.944 --> 12:44.712
        yeah, they hated him    
        just like you did.      

12:44.747 --> 12:47.182
oh, god, I'm so sorry.          
I feel bad.                     

12:47.216 --> 12:49.684
I shouldn't have put that       
out there in the universe.      

12:49.718 --> 12:52.587
          well, I don't think   
          that's why they hated 
          him, but thanks.      

12:52.621 --> 12:54.823
  okay, well, why do you        
  think they hated him?         

12:54.857 --> 12:57.075
         I don't know.          
         that's what I'm gonna  
         try to figure out.     

12:57.109 --> 12:59.527
      - well, do you want       
        a second eye?           
      - sure.                   

13:08.170 --> 13:10.588
        - ashley.               
        - hmm?                  

13:12.441 --> 13:14.759
  ( laughs )                    
  I'm sorry.                    

13:14.794 --> 13:17.445
    - I'll go put pants on.     
    - thank you.                

13:20.816 --> 13:23.818
        or we could watch       
          it upstairs.          

13:23.853 --> 13:26.855
        - I'll cover up.        
        - I can't focus.        

13:26.889 --> 13:30.308
          so just don't         
      let me distract you.      

13:32.928 --> 13:35.396
    we get that, all right?     
    give it to them.            

13:35.430 --> 13:38.783
    but at the same time,       
    we've got to give them--    

13:38.818 --> 13:40.935
excuse me, everybody.           
i'll be right back.             

13:44.507 --> 13:46.991
turtle, what's up?              
everything okay with vince?     

13:47.042 --> 13:49.294
- oh yeah, vince is fine.       
- oh, thank god.                

13:49.328 --> 13:51.863
I thought you were              
gonna tell me you ran           
over him with the ferrari.      

13:51.897 --> 13:53.832
    - no.                       
    - then what are you         
      doing here?               

13:53.883 --> 13:56.117
     I was wondering if I could 
     talk to you for a minute.  

13:56.135 --> 13:58.786
    - talk to me about what?    
    - career advice.            

13:58.804 --> 14:00.471
          - for who?            
          - for me.             

14:00.506 --> 14:03.124
 - but you don't have a career. 
 - five minutes.                

14:03.142 --> 14:05.343
      - I'm in a meeting.       
      - come on, ari.           

14:05.394 --> 14:07.028
        it's my birthday.       

14:07.062 --> 14:09.463
    five minutes.               

14:09.481 --> 14:12.400
lloyd, tell them                
i'll be right back.             

14:12.434 --> 14:15.353
    - what's up, lloyd?         
    - hello, mr.... Turtle.     

14:15.404 --> 14:17.655
                  what's up?    

14:17.690 --> 14:20.275
i'm looking for funding         
for a business idea             
that I have.                    

14:20.309 --> 14:21.943
    - did you go to a bank?     
    - yeah.                     

14:21.977 --> 14:23.778
they laughed in my face         
'cause I have no collateral.    

14:23.812 --> 14:26.314
  - did you tell them about     
    your hat collection?        
  - come on, ari.               

14:26.332 --> 14:28.700
    you live with a guy         
    who just gave you a quarter-
    of-a-million-dollar car.    

14:28.751 --> 14:31.319
 - you need money, go to him.   
 - I'm trying to do this        
   on my own.                   

14:31.337 --> 14:34.055
         coming here asking     
         me for money is not    
         doing it on your own.  

14:34.089 --> 14:36.157
no no no, I'm not               
asking you for money.           
i'm asking you                  

14:36.175 --> 14:38.492
to put me in touch              
with people who invest          
in businesses                   

14:38.510 --> 14:40.345
and I know you know             
those kinds of people.          

14:40.379 --> 14:42.931
you've stuck with vince         
through all the rough times.    

14:42.965 --> 14:46.384
      now he's on easy street   
      and you want to branch    
      out on your own?          

14:46.435 --> 14:48.770
    - you two have a fight?     
    - no.                       

14:48.804 --> 14:52.357
  I just think it's time        
  for me to make something      
  of myself.                    

14:52.391 --> 14:54.642
            turtle, do you know 
            what it takes       

14:54.676 --> 14:56.311
            to make something   
            of yourself?        

14:56.345 --> 14:59.013
            I mean, come on.    
            I worked a job      

14:59.031 --> 15:01.866
            through college     
            and grad school.    
            lloyd!              

15:03.118 --> 15:04.652
    - <i>yes, Mr. Gold?</i>            
    - hit the stack.            

15:04.687 --> 15:06.788
        in front of people?     
        I'm not performing.     

15:06.822 --> 15:10.375
  - "the kingdom of foibles."   
  - "the kingdom of foibles"

           <i>a man awakes</i>         
           <i>in the midst of--</i>    

15:15.648 --> 15:17.582
this man can quote              
from the entire stack.          

15:17.633 --> 15:20.468
that is what                    
he's willing to put in          
for his own success.            

15:20.502 --> 15:23.054
he's paying his dues.           
when have you paid yours?       

15:23.088 --> 15:25.673
i'm willing to pay them now.    
and I have a great idea.        

15:25.708 --> 15:28.726
so do all these idiots.         
can you execute it?             

15:28.761 --> 15:30.261
             I think I can.     

15:30.312 --> 15:33.765
in this life,                   
no one is going                 
to invest                       

15:33.816 --> 15:35.717
          because you think     
          you can.              

15:35.751 --> 15:37.402
          do you have           
          a business plan?      

15:37.436 --> 15:39.120
          no.  I mean,          
  I haven't sat down and put--  

15:39.154 --> 15:42.740
       <i>what do you need?</i>        
       <i>office space, insurance?</i> 
       <i>how many employees?</i>      

15:42.775 --> 15:45.593
what do you project to earn?    
what do you need to break even? 

15:45.628 --> 15:48.079
at what point                   
can your investors              

15:48.113 --> 15:50.481
    - see some profit?          
    - I don't know!             

15:51.784 --> 15:54.035
              I don't know.     

15:54.069 --> 15:56.587
    look...                     

15:56.622 --> 15:58.923
      when my son was born,     

15:58.958 --> 16:01.742
    my greatest fear was having 
    this conversation.          

16:01.760 --> 16:05.213
        I knew that I would give
        him anything he wanted  

16:05.247 --> 16:07.932
         because he was my son  
         and I couldn't say no. 

16:07.967 --> 16:09.968
         which sucks, 'cause it 
         wouldn't help him      

16:10.019 --> 16:12.753
     and he'd just end up       
     on the street doing heroin 
     with the two coreys        

16:12.771 --> 16:15.356
          because I was too much
          of a pussy to teach   
          him a lesson.         

16:15.391 --> 16:18.409
            I won't make that   
            mistake with you.   
            just say no.        

16:19.695 --> 16:21.479
I can pull this off, ari.       

16:21.530 --> 16:24.048
        come back to me         
        when you can prove it.  

16:26.735 --> 16:29.320
    ( bird squawking )          

16:29.371 --> 16:32.056
         um, no, ma'am.         
      I don't think that's      
            the case.           

16:32.091 --> 16:34.075
 why?                           

16:34.109 --> 16:37.778
well, because skateboards       
don't get flat tires.           

16:37.796 --> 16:39.113
                ( laughs )      

16:39.131 --> 16:41.666
    no, I'm not calling         
your son a liar whatsoever.     

16:41.717 --> 16:43.918
            hold on.            
          can you quiet         
         that damn bird?        

16:43.952 --> 16:45.386
             what, you don't    
             like birds?        

16:45.421 --> 16:47.672
      no, I just don't like     
 anything that talks that much. 

16:47.723 --> 16:49.457
            ( laughs )          

16:49.475 --> 16:52.977
              <i>hello?</i>            
       <i>no, Mrs. Henderson,</i>      
     <i>i wasn't talking to you.</i>   

16:53.012 --> 16:55.046
  what?                         

16:55.080 --> 16:57.465
  why does he have to keep      
  yellinat the bird?            

16:57.483 --> 16:59.467
        because it's funny.     

16:59.485 --> 17:02.236
     - not to me it isn't.      
     - you think that's one     
       of the reasons           

17:02.271 --> 17:04.805
          people don't like him,
          'cause he yelled      
          at the bird?          

17:04.823 --> 17:06.773
it's one of the reasons         
I don't like him.               

17:06.808 --> 17:08.943
but I'm a big                   
animal lover, so...             

17:08.977 --> 17:10.645
        what are some of        
        the other reasons?      

17:10.679 --> 17:12.530
    I don't know.               

17:12.580 --> 17:14.281
            you don't know?     

17:14.316 --> 17:16.117
I don't want to say it.         

17:16.151 --> 17:18.752
    you're gonna hold back now? 
    you already told me         
    you hate him.               

17:18.787 --> 17:20.338
        so what specifically    
        about him do you hate?  

17:20.372 --> 17:23.174
      - I think he sucks.       
      - you think he sucks?     

17:23.208 --> 17:27.045
yes, and you have tohink        
      he sucks also, eric.      

17:27.096 --> 17:29.714
            because he          
            really does suck.   

17:29.765 --> 17:32.266
        I mean, he seems nervous
        and uncomfortable.      

17:32.301 --> 17:36.504
            it makes me nervous 
            and uncomfortable   
            just to watch him.  

17:36.522 --> 17:40.341
      - are you mad?            
      - no.  I'm not mad.       

17:40.359 --> 17:44.678
I guess that's probably why     
I didn't fight more when they   
said they wanted to replace him.

17:44.696 --> 17:47.281
    - so he sucks.              
    - yeah, okay, he sucks.     

17:47.316 --> 17:50.818
      - well, doesn't that      
        feel better?            
      - no.                     

17:50.852 --> 17:52.820
    it doesn't.                 
    I found him.                

17:52.855 --> 17:54.855
              I sold this show--
              his show.         

17:54.873 --> 17:57.825
          he put a year of work 
          into it and I can't do
          anything to help him. 

17:57.859 --> 18:00.745
but you can try.                
you're very persuasive          
when you want to be.            

18:00.796 --> 18:04.649
 - you think?                   
 - I wanted to go home          
   with drama the night we met. 

18:06.885 --> 18:10.505
    what am I supposed to do?   
    tell him I think he's great?

18:10.539 --> 18:13.524
You're in sales--               
that's what you do.             

18:15.794 --> 18:18.312
    wow, it's been              
    a whole 10 minutes          
    since I've been called      

18:18.347 --> 18:20.314
by one of the jonas brothers.   
what's up, e?                   

18:20.349 --> 18:21.983
     when you told me to get    
         rid of charlie,        

18:22.017 --> 18:24.585
was that your honest answer     
  or were you just looking out  
        for vince?              

18:24.620 --> 18:26.938
    vince is my client who is   
    producing the show with you.

18:26.989 --> 18:29.657
     - so of course I'm         
       looking out for him.     
     - <i>oh, come on, ari.</i>        

18:29.691 --> 18:33.161
    vince doesn't care about    
    the show, you know that.    
  he's a producer in name only. 

18:33.195 --> 18:35.329
    but charlie is my client    
      who I do care about.      

18:35.364 --> 18:38.366
   <i>so if you pretended to care</i>  
 <i>about him and you were me,</i>     
     <i>what would you do?</i>         

18:38.400 --> 18:41.102
    - what's the difference?    
    - I'd like to try to        
      do something.             

18:41.136 --> 18:44.205
what I'm capable of doing       
and what you're capable of doing

18:44.239 --> 18:46.007
are two totally                 
different things.               

18:46.041 --> 18:49.544
- what would you do?            
- I would make a scene          
  of biblical proportions.      

18:49.578 --> 18:53.181
      I would lie, scream,      
     beg, borrow and steal.     

18:53.215 --> 18:55.550
 <i>and if that somehow didn't</i>     
     <i>part amy miller's legs,</i>    

18:55.584 --> 18:59.387
    then I would call racism.   
        and I would yell        
        for all to hear,        

18:59.421 --> 19:03.757
      "you're really gonna      
    fire my poor black client   
    off the show he created?!   

19:03.775 --> 19:06.944
    I'm calling naacp,          
    the reverend al sharpton    

19:06.979 --> 19:09.263
          and the ghost         
      of my man malcolm x."     

19:09.298 --> 19:11.399
            awesome.            

19:11.433 --> 19:13.384
             I guess            
     I'll try my own thing.     

19:14.570 --> 19:16.454
        good luck.              

19:16.488 --> 19:18.806
     <i>( techno music playing )</i>   

19:28.851 --> 19:31.469
     - is she in?               
     - <i>yes, let me tell her</i>     
      <i> you're here.</i>             

19:31.503 --> 19:33.254
        - I'll tell her.        
        - <i>mr. Murphy--</i>          

19:33.288 --> 19:36.224
I just want you                 
to know that what you guys      
are doing is disgusting.        

19:36.258 --> 19:39.460
charlie busted his ass          
for you and you guys are        
gonna toss him because, what?   

19:39.478 --> 19:42.346
40 idiots from modesto          
who had nothing better          
to do today                     

19:42.397 --> 19:44.798
than to watch a pilot           
in order to get a free lunch    

19:44.816 --> 19:47.301
claim they didn't like him?     
I liked him!                    

19:47.319 --> 19:50.388
that's why I signed him.        
and you liked him,              
that's why you cast him.        

19:50.422 --> 19:52.523
you were right.                 
don't doubt yourself now.       

19:52.574 --> 19:55.910
charlie williams is this        
network's next superstar.       

19:55.944 --> 19:58.746
 - do you really believe that?  
 - yeah.                        

19:58.780 --> 20:00.147
        I do.                   

20:00.165 --> 20:04.252
              okay.             
        well, I'm sorry.        
            we don't.           

20:04.286 --> 20:07.171
      there is no way that      
    charlie williams is going   
to be acting in this show.      

20:07.206 --> 20:08.522
            ( sighs )           

20:08.557 --> 20:10.558
        well, then maybe        
        you're a racist.        

20:14.763 --> 20:16.764
( laughs )                      

20:16.798 --> 20:19.884
I can't believe                 
you actually said that.         

20:19.918 --> 20:23.204
        yeah, me either.        
  you should have seen the look 
      on amy miller's face.     

20:23.238 --> 20:26.057
( laughs )                      
I can only imagine.             

20:26.108 --> 20:29.360
- now I've gotta                
  go see charlie's face.        
- I had to fire my brother once.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.913
     - <i>really?</i>                  
     - <i>from a paper route.</i>      
      <i> it was rough.</i>            

20:31.947 --> 20:35.349
  - my parents wouldn't         
    talk to me for a week.      
  - that's a good story, ari.   

20:35.367 --> 20:36.534
            - e.                
            - <i>yeah?</i>             

20:36.568 --> 20:39.070
  - at least you went for it.   
  - so what?                    

20:39.121 --> 20:42.373
     - where did it get me?     
     - some much needed         
       lying experience.        

20:42.407 --> 20:47.161
 - so?                          
 - so next time you'll come up  
   with a better lie.           

20:47.195 --> 20:48.963
         you're the one         
    that told me to say that.   

20:48.997 --> 20:51.549
    yeah, but I can't believe   
        you actually did.       

20:51.583 --> 20:53.834
          - me either.          
          - <i>listen, e,</i>          

20:53.869 --> 20:57.004
      - I'm proud of you.       
      - thanks, ari.            

20:57.038 --> 20:59.173
        - <i>later.</i>                
        - later.                

21:00.759 --> 21:03.344
         are you trying to teach
         someone how to lie?    

21:03.378 --> 21:05.179
      what?                     
      no!                       

21:05.213 --> 21:07.848
          and how could you fire
          uncle howard?         

21:09.318 --> 21:11.385
             turtle:            
     you're really not going    
        to get me a gift?       

21:11.420 --> 21:15.406
no, I'm really not.             
because grown men shouldn't buy 
other grown men birthday gifts  

21:15.440 --> 21:17.558
- unless they're fucking.       
- ( laughter )                  

21:17.576 --> 21:19.727
  - no offense, bro.            
  - no offense taken, johnny.   

21:19.745 --> 21:21.746
but come on!                    
it's the kid's                  
30th birthday.                  

21:21.780 --> 21:24.332
e got him something.            
you gotta get him something.    

21:24.366 --> 21:26.400
      with the mood             
      he was in all day?        
      no way.                   

21:26.418 --> 21:28.402
 - he's not in a mood anymore.  
 - huh-uh.                      

21:28.420 --> 21:30.621
- why not?  what happened?      
- tell them.                    

21:30.672 --> 21:33.874
            I was gonna wait    
            till we sat down,   
            until e comes.      

21:33.909 --> 21:36.210
no one knows where e is.        
come on, speak up.              

21:37.763 --> 21:39.447
            I'm going           
            back to school.     

21:39.481 --> 21:40.631
        ( unison )              
              what?             

21:40.682 --> 21:42.350
    - yep.                      
    - <i>get out of here.</i>          
     <i> really?</i>                   

21:42.384 --> 21:45.436
        it was my idea--        
    so he can learn how         
    to really run a business.   

21:45.470 --> 21:48.522
      - wow, impressive!        
      - really impressive.      

21:48.557 --> 21:51.058
- thanks.

21:51.092 --> 21:54.979
    - get us the best bottle    
      of wine in the house.     
    - you got it, vince.        

21:55.030 --> 21:58.265
 - jamie: very nice.            
 - you know, I saw on cnn that  
   sending a child to school    

21:58.283 --> 22:00.534
            should run          
            around $200,000.    

22:00.569 --> 22:02.653
         this is a birthday gift
         I'd be proud to give.  

22:02.704 --> 22:05.956
     - <i>i got you covered.</i>       
     - jesus, johnny!           

22:05.991 --> 22:09.377
            that' great, drama, 
            but this is ucla    
            extension--

            courses-- $1292.    

22:12.247 --> 22:15.115
    - oh.  it's the thought     
      that counts.              
    - yeah.                     

22:15.133 --> 22:18.252
johnny, did you                 
know that?                      

22:18.286 --> 22:20.721
          - I did.              
          - oh my god.          

22:20.756 --> 22:23.257
             of course he did.  
             I should've let him
             write the check.   

22:23.291 --> 22:26.093
     - seriously.               
     - vince, are you guys

22:26.127 --> 22:27.461

22:27.479 --> 22:30.431
    - oh, look at here.         
    - vince: <i>where the hell</i>     
     <i> have you been?</i>            

22:30.465 --> 22:32.550
they fired charlie              
off the pilot today.            

22:32.584 --> 22:34.602
    - ow.                       
    - oh man, that's awful.     

22:34.636 --> 22:36.470
I had to tell him.              
that was really awful.          

22:36.488 --> 22:39.473
     oh, that poor bastard.     
    I cried every time I got    
    fired from a pilot.         

22:39.491 --> 22:42.827
and we're off                   
the show too, vince.            
I can't do this without charlie.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.363
      - no, of course not.      
      - you're not mad?         

22:45.414 --> 22:47.815
              mad?              
              no, I just feel   
              sorry for charlie.

22:47.833 --> 22:50.785
     - I mean, you and me,      
       we're okay.              
     - yeah.                    

22:50.819 --> 22:53.254
            - no?               
            - yeah.             

22:53.288 --> 22:56.574
- yo, we'll meet you guys       
  over in a sec.                
- yeah.                         

23:00.429 --> 23:02.630
    - what up?                  
    - I would have              
      liked this for me too.    

23:02.664 --> 23:05.165
you know, prove I could pull    
my own weight on this deal.     

23:05.183 --> 23:07.885
     you have                   
     pulled your own weight.    
     that's why I am where I am.

23:07.936 --> 23:10.971
  - the team is all good,       
    so what's really going on?  
  - what do you mean?           

23:11.005 --> 23:12.807
      - is it about sloan?      
      - what?                   

23:12.841 --> 23:15.976
      want to prove             
      you can get out from under
      the vincent chase shadow? 

23:16.010 --> 23:17.978
              hey, look,        
              I'll support you  
              all I can,        

23:18.012 --> 23:20.531
        but I can't help it     
        if the shadow just keeps
        growing larger.         

23:20.565 --> 23:23.567
it's actually                   
not about sloan.                
I like ashley.                  

23:23.618 --> 23:26.954

23:30.375 --> 23:33.461
- really?

  their own man, I guess.       

23:33.495 --> 23:36.046
