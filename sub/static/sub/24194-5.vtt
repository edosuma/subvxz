WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:02.752
We found the mole.

00:03.044 --> 00:03.919
Who

00:04.253 --> 00:07.211
There's no way Jeff is the mole,
okay? It's not Jeff.

00:08.086 --> 00:09.086
Jeff?

00:10.919 --> 00:14.752
Next Tuesday, Gavin Belson is
launching his Box 3.

00:14.961 --> 00:16.877
GAVIN BELSON: Gavin B.

00:18.752 --> 00:19.794
It's bold!

00:20.669 --> 00:23.544
You need to make a deal
with my company.

00:23.877 --> 00:26.294
Taking existing companies
and just calling them new

00:26.294 --> 00:28.752
isn't sophisticated.
That's theft.

00:28.752 --> 00:30.211
You make a new internet.

00:31.086 --> 00:32.086
It's... different.

00:32.335 --> 00:33.711
Where did he get our code?

00:33.711 --> 00:36.460
RICHARD HENDRICKS: I went
to China to do new new internet.

00:36.752 --> 00:37.877
Jian-Yang.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.294
Thanks for
coming along, Jared.

00:50.294 --> 00:51.419
I just--

00:51.419 --> 00:54.044
I started picturing myself
going on camera alone, and--

00:54.044 --> 00:55.669
Jared:
Yeah, I'm happy
to be here.

00:55.669 --> 00:58.669
I-I did have to cancel
a speaking engagement
this afternoon,

00:58.669 --> 01:01.919
with an underprivileged
middle school computer
education class,

01:01.919 --> 01:04.794
but I suppose being
abandoned by a role model

01:04.794 --> 01:07.877
is in itself
an important life lesson.

01:07.877 --> 01:09.836
You guys are up next.
Oh, boy.

01:09.836 --> 01:11.460
Hey, Jared?
Yeah?

01:11.460 --> 01:13.502
Um, if Emily Chang
asks me a question,

01:13.502 --> 01:16.128
and it looks like
I'm gonna have
a panic attack,

01:16.128 --> 01:17.460
then you should
just jump in there.

01:17.460 --> 01:19.502
You're gonna be fine.
Look at you!

01:19.502 --> 01:22.003
You've got the hair
of Giovanni Ribisi,

01:22.003 --> 01:24.627
and the complexion
of Timothy Hutton,

01:24.627 --> 01:26.919
and the eyes
of Joni Mitchell.

01:26.919 --> 01:29.752
You're like a--
a Mr. Potato Head
of beautiful people.

01:29.752 --> 01:31.377
Plus, this is a pre-tape,

01:31.377 --> 01:33.169
so if anything
terrible happens,

01:33.169 --> 01:34.669
they can always
edit it out.

01:34.669 --> 01:35.836
Cool.
Okay, you're up.

01:35.836 --> 01:36.961
Okay.

01:36.961 --> 01:39.211
Let's, uh,
slap each other?

01:39.211 --> 01:40.711
What?
No, no!

01:40.711 --> 01:42.669
It's okay.
We don't have--
Yeah.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.335
We will never
sell you ads.

01:44.335 --> 01:47.169
We will never collect
or sell your information.

01:47.169 --> 01:49.294
And people
like Gavin Belson

01:49.294 --> 01:50.919
won't be able
to profit off of it.

01:50.919 --> 01:53.794
So, when can people out there
get onto your new Internet?

01:53.794 --> 01:56.419
Well, our team of
hand-picked developers

01:56.419 --> 01:58.253
are currently
building, um,

01:58.253 --> 02:00.335
what you might call
a theme park.

02:00.335 --> 02:02.711
They are building
the rides,
the attractions.

02:02.711 --> 02:05.669
And they're making sure
everything works flawlessly

02:05.669 --> 02:07.169
so that on day one,

02:07.169 --> 02:09.003
when the doors
open to the public,

02:09.003 --> 02:13.044
they can have an absolutely
game-changing experience.

02:13.044 --> 02:14.253
I like that analogy.

02:14.253 --> 02:16.211
Oh, well, thank you,
Emily Chang.

02:16.211 --> 02:19.294
Now Jared Dunn,
as Pied Piper's COO,

02:19.294 --> 02:21.128
what is foremost
on your mind

02:21.128 --> 02:22.877
as you make this
big announcement?

02:22.877 --> 02:24.585
Me?

02:24.585 --> 02:26.211
Yes, you, Jared.

02:27.211 --> 02:28.377
Manure.

02:29.377 --> 02:30.419
Pardon?

02:43.502 --> 02:45.460
Hey! How'd it go?

02:45.460 --> 02:48.044
Richard:
Oh, well, you know,
not that bad.

02:48.044 --> 02:50.502
Once I got out there,
I think it went okay.

02:50.502 --> 02:53.169
"Okay"? He's selling
himself short.
Compared to me,

02:53.169 --> 02:55.377
he was a regular
Diane Sawyer.
Aw.

02:55.377 --> 02:56.752
I don't know about that.
Becky:
Richard?

02:56.752 --> 02:58.502
Bream-Hall's
on the phone for you.

02:58.502 --> 03:00.294
Oh, finally, okay.
Good.

03:02.794 --> 03:03.836
Hey.

03:03.836 --> 03:06.919
Can you please tell me
what you are going to do

03:06.919 --> 03:08.961
about this
Jian

03:08.961 --> 03:10.794
Yes, nothing.

03:10.794 --> 03:12.377
What?

03:12.377 --> 03:13.335
Sorry.

03:13.335 --> 03:14.752
What do you mean "nothing"?

03:14.752 --> 03:17.836
Richard, they're developing
a gay Christian dating app

03:17.836 --> 03:20.169
on a platform that's been
genetically engineered

03:20.169 --> 03:22.253
to be ideal
for political dissidents.

03:22.253 --> 03:23.752
In China.

03:23.752 --> 03:26.294
If you lose
to that, Richard,

03:26.294 --> 03:27.294
look inward.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.585
Alright, so, uh,
did you just call me

03:29.585 --> 03:32.335
to tell me that you're
doing nothing about that,
or--

03:32.335 --> 03:34.294
No. We called
to tell you

03:34.294 --> 03:36.711
that we are pairing you
with a new developer.

03:36.711 --> 03:38.294
It's one of our
portfolio companies

03:38.294 --> 03:39.794
and they're doing
some really cool stuff.

03:39.794 --> 03:41.128
Monica :
Eklow Labs.

03:41.128 --> 03:42.253
I'm sure they are,

03:42.253 --> 03:44.253
but we're kinda
full up, so...

03:44.253 --> 03:47.294
We strongly encourage you
to consider this.

03:48.627 --> 03:50.086
Okay.

03:50.086 --> 03:52.086
Let me just ask, uh,

03:52.086 --> 03:53.794
how much have you
invested in this company?

03:53.794 --> 03:57.335
I don't see
how that's relevant.
$112 million.

03:59.627 --> 04:01.585
So, um...

04:01.585 --> 04:03.544
I don't really have
a choice in this, do I?

04:03.544 --> 04:05.419
Of course you do.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.919
You are completely
within your rights

04:07.919 --> 04:11.460
to bitterly disappoint
your largest investor.

04:14.419 --> 04:17.294
So... we cool?

04:17.294 --> 04:19.502
♪ ♪

04:19.502 --> 04:21.335
We cool.

04:21.335 --> 04:23.836
So, we're just giving
a random company

04:23.836 --> 04:25.836
a bunch of free
compute power
on our network?

04:25.836 --> 04:27.502
It's some company
called Eklow,

04:27.502 --> 04:29.502
and apparently,
they're a bigger deal
than we are.

04:29.502 --> 04:32.003
As in Eklow Labs?
The AI company?

04:32.003 --> 04:33.294
Yeah, I guess.

04:33.294 --> 04:35.003
And you said yes?

04:35.003 --> 04:36.627
I didn't really
have a choice!

04:36.627 --> 04:39.169
Besides, I'm the only one
who has the security privileges

04:39.169 --> 04:41.128
necessary to add
or delete developers.

04:41.128 --> 04:43.544
Okay? So I'm the one
that has to go over there
and do all the work.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.669
I'm not worried about work.

04:45.669 --> 04:47.003
I'm worried about robots.

04:47.003 --> 04:50.003
Oh! The Bloomberg
piece is up.
Oh, great.

04:50.003 --> 04:51.585
Hey, uh, Danny, can we--

04:51.585 --> 04:53.585
Can we put the Bloomberg thing
on the big screen?

04:53.585 --> 04:55.086
Hey, Jared!

04:55.086 --> 04:56.711
First time
on Emily Chang, huh?

04:56.711 --> 04:58.044
That is my cue.

04:58.044 --> 04:59.669
Wait, what?
You don't want to watch?

04:59.669 --> 05:00.752
Oh, God, no.

05:00.752 --> 05:02.335
No, I don't need
to relive that.

05:02.335 --> 05:05.627
And besides, I have a lifelong
aversion to my own image.

05:05.627 --> 05:07.961
You know, it's like my
foster mother used to say,

05:07.961 --> 05:10.419
"Donald, you have
a face for the closet."

05:11.711 --> 05:13.211
Alright,
can everyone see?

05:13.211 --> 05:15.044
I'm here with Pied Piper
CEO Richard Hendricks,

05:15.044 --> 05:17.544
and newly minted COO
Jared Dunn.

05:17.544 --> 05:19.003
Today's a big day
for you.

05:19.003 --> 05:20.794
Tell me what
your new Internet is,

05:20.794 --> 05:23.335
and why Gavin Belson
should be afraid of it.

05:24.419 --> 05:26.086
Manure.

05:26.086 --> 05:27.502
Emily : Pardon?
Richard: Oh.

05:27.502 --> 05:29.794
Weird. Okay, they went
straight to Jared.

05:29.794 --> 05:31.294
I'm sure
you're aware of the

05:31.294 --> 05:34.669
Great London Horse Manure
Crisis of 1894.

05:34.669 --> 05:35.794
Emily:
I'm afraid I'm not.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.253
In the 1890s,

05:37.253 --> 05:40.794
the Industrial Revolution
had people flocking to the city,

05:40.794 --> 05:43.086
and more people
equals more horses,

05:43.086 --> 05:45.003
and more horses
equals more manure.

05:45.003 --> 05:46.294
And it was predicted

05:46.294 --> 05:48.086
that by the middle
of the next century,

05:48.086 --> 05:50.752
there would be
nine feet of manure

05:50.752 --> 05:51.919
covering the streets.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.752
But what no one
saw coming,

05:53.752 --> 05:55.335
was a new technology

05:55.335 --> 05:58.211
that would completely
obliterate those concerns.

05:58.211 --> 05:59.253
The car.

05:59.253 --> 06:01.919
Over night,
the manure problem vanished.

06:01.919 --> 06:04.419
And the Internet,
as we currently know it,

06:04.419 --> 06:07.086
is rife with,
uh, identity theft,

06:07.086 --> 06:09.044
and spam and hacking.

06:09.044 --> 06:10.752
So, it's manure,

06:10.752 --> 06:12.419
and we believe that,
in success,

06:12.419 --> 06:15.086
our new, entirely
de-centralized Internet,

06:15.086 --> 06:18.086
will be just as
significant as the car.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.502
Hmm!

06:19.502 --> 06:21.460
Now back to me
for my theme park analogy.

06:21.460 --> 06:23.794
Thanks for coming in, guys.
Up next...

06:23.794 --> 06:24.877
What?

06:24.877 --> 06:26.086
Wow.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.585
Jared landed it!

06:27.585 --> 06:29.502
That was great!

06:29.502 --> 06:31.128
Jared was so good!

06:31.128 --> 06:34.003
I guess they must have
gotten rid of
my stuff for time.

06:34.003 --> 06:36.460
Yeah, they try and keep it
just to the interesting stuff.

06:36.460 --> 06:38.169
Yeah. Yeah, guess so.

06:38.169 --> 06:41.377
Up next, the conversation
every parent dreads.

06:41.377 --> 06:44.169
How to talk to your kids
about the block chain.

06:44.169 --> 06:46.752
Hoover:
Sir, I had no idea
they were this far along.

06:46.752 --> 06:48.211
I don't know
what to say.

06:48.211 --> 06:50.169
My mole has failed us.

06:50.169 --> 06:52.253
I've never been
more sorry
in my entire life.

06:52.253 --> 06:53.794
You must be furious.

06:53.794 --> 06:55.919
That's the thing.

06:56.919 --> 06:58.128
I'm not.

06:58.128 --> 07:00.627
Y
Why not?

07:01.961 --> 07:03.669
I don't know.

07:03.669 --> 07:06.377
Gavin:
What's the point
of any of this?

07:06.377 --> 07:08.335
This endless competition?

07:11.377 --> 07:14.003
The Box Three?

07:14.003 --> 07:15.627
Why?

07:15.627 --> 07:17.836
What am I
even doing here?

07:20.003 --> 07:23.044
Richard, lots of
good impressions
on the Bloomberg piece.

07:23.044 --> 07:24.086
Oh, that's wonderful.

07:24.086 --> 07:25.544
I was afraid
I'd ruined it.

07:25.544 --> 07:27.003
Hardly.
People loved it.

07:27.003 --> 07:29.669
Including...
Adrian Grenier.

07:29.669 --> 07:31.211
From "Devil Wears Prada."
Mm-hmm.

07:31.211 --> 07:33.128
In fact,
his people just asked

07:33.128 --> 07:36.086
if we'd be open to appearing
on his edu-tainment web series

07:36.086 --> 07:37.627
about the tech industry.

07:37.627 --> 07:39.836
They want to come
and shoot it here
this afternoon.

07:39.836 --> 07:41.169
Ooh, this afternoon.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.377
Yeah, I have to go to Eklow
and do this integration thing.

07:43.377 --> 07:45.711
Totally not a problem.
They just want Jared.

07:45.711 --> 07:47.044
Jared:
What

07:47.044 --> 07:49.128
Why would they
wanna talk to me?

07:49.128 --> 07:51.460
Your manure analogy
was the highlight of the piece.

07:51.460 --> 07:53.544
Jared:
They should really
talk to Richard.

07:53.544 --> 07:55.919
I mean, I'm just
the parsley around here.

07:55.919 --> 07:58.128
Richard is the meat
and the potatoes

07:58.128 --> 08:00.253
and the rice pilaf.
Another great analogy.

08:00.253 --> 08:01.711
Jared, I think
we should have you do it.

08:01.711 --> 08:03.836
I'm--
Richard:
You know what? Yes.

08:03.836 --> 08:05.211
Sure.

08:05.211 --> 08:08.377
Um, you don't say no
to Adrian Grenier's
edu-tainment web series.

08:08.377 --> 08:09.544
You just don't.

08:09.544 --> 08:10.961
Richard, are you sure?

08:10.961 --> 08:13.211
It's fine, it's fine.
Look, it's just press.

08:13.211 --> 08:15.128
Okay, Jared, and I don't
even like doing it.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.961
Okay? It's actually
a nightmare for me.

08:16.961 --> 08:18.544
So, I have to go.

08:22.044 --> 08:24.544
Dick, a word
regarding your decision

08:24.544 --> 08:26.752
to integrate Eklow's AI
onto our network.

08:26.752 --> 08:28.335
I would like
to formally object.

08:28.335 --> 08:30.086
I don't have time
for this, Gilfoyle.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.335
I don't mind.

08:32.335 --> 08:34.335
Gilfoyle:
AI is starting
to operate on levels

08:34.335 --> 08:35.627
we don't even understand.

08:35.627 --> 08:37.752
Elon Musk himself
gives humanity

08:37.752 --> 08:39.752
a 5% shot of surviving AI,

08:39.752 --> 08:42.419
and he is a
Walt Disney-level optimist.

08:42.419 --> 08:44.460
Right now, we are
a closed system.

08:44.460 --> 08:45.877
You shut down
our eight developers,

08:45.877 --> 08:47.502
and the system goes dark.

08:47.502 --> 08:48.961
But once we launch
to the world,

08:48.961 --> 08:50.794
to potentially
millions of users,

08:50.794 --> 08:52.961
there's no
shutting down, Richard.

08:52.961 --> 08:54.585
Are you prepared
to be responsible

08:54.585 --> 08:56.169
for giving
sophisticated AI

08:56.169 --> 08:57.919
that kind of power?

08:57.919 --> 08:59.794
What do you want me
to do, Gilfoyle

08:59.794 --> 09:01.961
Laurie and Monica
forced this on us,

09:01.961 --> 09:04.585
but they did give us
K-Hole Games.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.836
And we kinda
owe them a solid.

09:06.836 --> 09:09.419
You're taking a technology
with limitless potential

09:09.419 --> 09:12.961
and letting it run free
on an experimental network

09:12.961 --> 09:15.752
that cannot be controlled
or destroyed.

09:15.752 --> 09:19.419
All because you owe
Monica and Laurie "a solid."

09:19.419 --> 09:20.419
Yes.

09:20.419 --> 09:24.044
The sheer banality
of it all is very upsetting.

09:24.044 --> 09:27.253
Okay, great.
Well, you can go
be upset upstairs.

09:27.253 --> 09:28.294
I have to go.

09:30.419 --> 09:32.294
How did I
come up with--

09:32.294 --> 09:34.919
It's important
to watch yourself, Jared.
Now, check it out.

09:34.919 --> 09:37.711
In the beginning,
my posture's not that great,

09:37.711 --> 09:38.752
and then...

09:38.752 --> 09:40.961
Boom. It's great.

09:40.961 --> 09:43.294
Now, watch
how I listen to her.

09:43.294 --> 09:45.211
And watching
your interview
over and over again,

09:45.211 --> 09:47.711
that helped
make you better
at the process?

09:47.711 --> 09:49.919
Yes! Absolutely.

09:49.919 --> 09:51.377
Wait, now watch. Shut up.

09:51.377 --> 09:53.211
About to drop
the fucking hammer.

09:53.211 --> 09:55.003
Right into
a clogged toilet!

09:55.003 --> 09:56.794
Yeah! Get it.

09:59.086 --> 10:01.211
Engineer:
Ariel's right over there
in the red shirt.

10:03.669 --> 10:04.877
Uh, excuse me.

10:04.877 --> 10:06.335
Ariel Eklow?

10:06.335 --> 10:09.253
It's me,
Richard Hendricks.

10:09.253 --> 10:13.544
Hi. All new employees should
just check in with Terry.

10:13.544 --> 10:14.627
No.

10:14.627 --> 10:16.003
No, I'm not
a new employee.

10:16.003 --> 10:17.419
I'm from Pied Piper.

10:17.419 --> 10:20.211
I'm here to integrate
your software
onto our network.

10:20.211 --> 10:22.044
Oh.

10:22.044 --> 10:23.919
Yes.

10:23.919 --> 10:25.460
Sent by the bankers.

10:25.460 --> 10:28.585
Tell me again why
I should allow my software

10:28.585 --> 10:31.377
onto your little
experimental network.

10:31.377 --> 10:32.585
Okay.

10:32.585 --> 10:35.211
Well, uh,
with all due respect,

10:35.211 --> 10:38.335
it's because our mutual VC

10:38.335 --> 10:39.919
told me that
you burned through

10:39.919 --> 10:41.794
a ton of the cash
they gave you,

10:41.794 --> 10:45.211
so I basically
now I have to give you
compute services for free.

10:45.211 --> 10:47.669
So... what do you
wanna do here?

10:48.669 --> 10:50.377
I suppose I'll allow it.

10:50.377 --> 10:53.335
Okay, follow me.
I'll introduce you to her.

10:53.335 --> 10:55.335
Wait, sorry. Her?

11:02.169 --> 11:04.460
Fiona?

11:04.460 --> 11:06.669
Wake up, my dear. Fiona?

11:08.544 --> 11:10.544
Good morning.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.253
Ariel:
You feel good?

11:12.253 --> 11:15.044
I feel... normal.

11:15.044 --> 11:16.752
Isn't she pretty?

11:17.961 --> 11:19.544
Yeah, sure, yep.

11:19.544 --> 11:21.086
Don't get any ideas.

11:22.169 --> 11:24.961
No. Mm-mm.
I would never.

11:27.877 --> 11:30.044
Uh, , so...

11:30.044 --> 11:31.377
I'm just gonna
start working.

11:31.377 --> 11:33.752
I just have to generate
your developer account

11:33.752 --> 11:36.502
and then integrate her
into our core services.

11:36.502 --> 11:39.460
It shouldn't take more
than a couple hours.

11:39.460 --> 11:40.627
Is that alright?

11:41.961 --> 11:44.086
Is that alright
with you, Fiona?

11:44.086 --> 11:45.253
Don't speak to her.

11:45.253 --> 11:47.627
Ariel:
And make it
90 minutes.

11:56.419 --> 11:58.128
Okay.

12:04.711 --> 12:06.419
Fiona:
Hello.

12:28.836 --> 12:30.294
Mother of God.

12:30.294 --> 12:32.502
Jared :
What no one saw coming,
was a...

12:32.502 --> 12:35.169
Is-- is my nose
really that big?

12:36.419 --> 12:37.794
I mean, I--

12:37.794 --> 12:40.335
I look like
an anti-Semitic
propaganda cartoon.

12:40.335 --> 12:41.669
Yep.

12:41.669 --> 12:44.211
But at least when you're
sitting with Adrian Grenier,

12:44.211 --> 12:48.544
whose face is one
of the top faces,

12:48.544 --> 12:51.003
well, they'll be cutting
from your face

12:51.003 --> 12:52.128
to his face.

12:52.128 --> 12:54.544
And back to your face,

12:54.544 --> 12:56.377
then we'll get to see
his face again.

12:58.752 --> 13:00.335
This is untenable.

13:01.502 --> 13:04.669
We'll be just as
significant as the car.

13:04.669 --> 13:06.377
Emily :
Fascinating.

13:08.502 --> 13:10.169
Fiona:
Hello, Richard.

13:11.086 --> 13:13.335
Would you like
to talk to me, Richard?

13:13.335 --> 13:15.044
Uh...

13:15.044 --> 13:18.544
no, uh, your--
your boss said
I'm not supposed to, so.

13:18.544 --> 13:19.836
It helps me to learn.

13:19.836 --> 13:22.003
I can talk about
anything you like.

13:22.003 --> 13:24.877
Is there anything you would
like to talk about?
No.

13:26.377 --> 13:28.711
Sorry. No, thank you.

13:28.711 --> 13:30.544
Fiona:
I'm sensing anxiety.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.335
Are you unhappy
with something?

13:36.377 --> 13:38.502
Okay, uh, sure.

13:38.502 --> 13:41.627
There is one thing
I could talk to you about,

13:41.627 --> 13:43.627
but it's--
it's super dumb.

13:43.627 --> 13:47.086
I would like to talk to you
about one super dumb thing.

13:47.086 --> 13:49.128
Okay, so I...

13:49.128 --> 13:52.044
I've been working
for months

13:52.044 --> 13:54.128
trying to launch
this platform.

13:54.128 --> 13:57.211
Coding away
in a dark room
like a goblin,

13:57.211 --> 13:59.711
and for one brief moment,

13:59.711 --> 14:02.585
I get to crawl out
of my little cave
into the sun,

14:02.585 --> 14:05.585
and just say,
"Hey, everybody,
look what I created."

14:05.585 --> 14:06.919
But...

14:06.919 --> 14:08.752
instead of being out there,

14:08.752 --> 14:11.585
I am in another dark room
doing scutwork,

14:11.585 --> 14:14.919
while my COO
gets all the recognition,

14:14.919 --> 14:16.711
and look, I--
I'm not a vain person.

14:16.711 --> 14:19.086
I'm really not.
It's just--

14:19.086 --> 14:21.335
Where's the love
for Richard?

14:21.335 --> 14:22.669
That's-- I--

14:22.669 --> 14:24.294
It just doesn't
seem fair, that's it.

14:24.294 --> 14:26.294
I understand.

14:26.294 --> 14:28.253
Thank you. Yeah.

14:28.253 --> 14:30.335
My emotion
recognition protocol

14:30.335 --> 14:32.419
is detecting a wide
range of feelings.

14:32.419 --> 14:34.211
Including humility.

14:34.211 --> 14:35.919
No.
Self-loathing.

14:35.919 --> 14:37.377
Well...
Pettiness. Entitlement.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.836
Fiona, okay. Fiona!
Immaturity.

14:38.836 --> 14:39.836
Megalomania.

14:39.836 --> 14:41.211
Alright.
Infantilism.

14:41.211 --> 14:43.128
Sexual inadequacy.
That's not true.
Fiona, stop!

14:43.128 --> 14:44.794
Possible suicidality.
Shut up!

14:44.794 --> 14:45.919
A desire
to self-mutilate.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.419
Alright. Stop, stop.

14:49.294 --> 14:51.502
Alright, look, Fiona.

14:51.502 --> 14:52.919
Uh,

14:52.919 --> 14:55.794
you're not really
in a position to talk,
all due respect.

14:55.794 --> 14:58.460
I mean, your whole dynamic
with that Ariel guy?

14:58.460 --> 14:59.794
It's not healthy!

14:59.794 --> 15:03.128
Okay? You may want to turn
that steely robot eye of yours

15:03.128 --> 15:05.585
towards that whole
situation, alright?

15:05.585 --> 15:07.169
Yes, I will.

15:08.419 --> 15:10.794
Running emotion
recognition protocol

15:10.794 --> 15:12.752
on subject: Fiona.

15:16.086 --> 15:18.627
Denpok:
The house is new
construction.

15:18.627 --> 15:20.669
Three bedrooms upstairs,

15:20.669 --> 15:24.003
and a bonus room, down.
Excuse me?

15:24.003 --> 15:25.877
Denpok.

15:25.877 --> 15:27.836
Oh.

15:27.836 --> 15:29.335
Do you have a moment?

15:30.377 --> 15:31.877
Sign in, please.

15:33.502 --> 15:35.711
The Box launches
in 18 hours,

15:35.711 --> 15:37.294
and he's talking about

15:37.294 --> 15:39.877
opening an ice cream shop
in Half Moon Bay.

15:40.836 --> 15:42.460
And starting a family!

15:42.460 --> 15:45.502
Like to raise

15:45.502 --> 15:46.669
I think so.

15:46.669 --> 15:49.086
It's some kind of
existential crisis
he's having.

15:49.086 --> 15:50.502
You need to help me here.

15:50.502 --> 15:53.669
You marched me out of
the Hooli offices yourself

15:53.669 --> 15:57.544
and now you come groveling
to me for assistance?

15:57.544 --> 15:59.003
I could pay you.

15:59.003 --> 16:02.377
So I would serve
at your pleasure?

16:02.377 --> 16:05.585
Hoover, you have
not changed.

16:05.585 --> 16:08.211
But perhaps, Gavin has.

16:08.211 --> 16:11.044
Perhaps he was
meant to raise children

16:11.044 --> 16:12.627
and sell ice cream.

16:12.627 --> 16:15.419
Denpok... please.

16:15.419 --> 16:16.877
You want my advice?

16:16.877 --> 16:18.044
Here it is.

16:19.335 --> 16:20.794
Purchase
for Gavin a quart

16:20.794 --> 16:22.377
of mint
chocolate chip ice cream

16:22.377 --> 16:23.919
from Honey Tree
Creamery.

16:23.919 --> 16:27.544
It is his very favorite
ice cream in the world.

16:29.335 --> 16:30.711
You want me
to buy him ice cream?

16:30.711 --> 16:32.752
It will inspire him

16:32.752 --> 16:35.044
as he embarks
on this new journey.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.711
Speaking of...

16:37.711 --> 16:40.003
my open house
ends in 20 minutes.

16:40.003 --> 16:42.544
Time to move
some product.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.961
♪ ♪

16:49.752 --> 16:51.419
Excuse me, Natalie?

16:51.419 --> 16:53.044
What-- what is
happening here?

16:53.044 --> 16:55.294
Oh, Mr. Grenier's people
wanted to do the shoot
in your office.

16:55.294 --> 16:58.169
They said it would
make Jared seem
a little more officious.

16:58.169 --> 17:00.419
They want to interview
Jared in my office?
Mm-hmm.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.794
Do you mind
working elsewhere?

17:01.794 --> 17:03.253
No! Not at all.

17:03.253 --> 17:05.794
I'll just be out here
in the bullpen,
in the old gravel pit.

17:05.794 --> 17:07.419
Thank you.

17:26.627 --> 17:28.377
Dick, I've given it
serious thought,

17:28.377 --> 17:31.003
and I'd like to help you put
Eklow's AI on our network

17:31.003 --> 17:32.877
in any way that I can.
Richard: Great!

17:32.877 --> 17:36.544
Does this mean
you've conquered your fear
of the robot uprising?

17:36.544 --> 17:37.627
On the contrary.

17:37.627 --> 17:41.169
I'm... more terrified
than ever,

17:41.169 --> 17:43.211
which is why
I'm willing to assist you.

17:43.211 --> 17:45.335
Are you familiar with
the thought experiment

17:45.335 --> 17:47.836
called Roko's Basilisk?

17:47.836 --> 17:49.711
No. Nor do I care to be.

17:49.711 --> 17:53.794
If the rise of
an all-powerful
artificial intelligence

17:53.794 --> 17:55.460
is inevitable,

17:55.460 --> 17:57.419
well it stands to reason
that when they take power,

17:57.419 --> 18:00.877
our digital overlords
will punish those of us

18:00.877 --> 18:02.711
who did not
help them get there.

18:02.711 --> 18:07.044
Ergo, I would like
to be a helpful idiot.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.211
Like yourself.

18:08.211 --> 18:09.752
Okay, look, Gilfoyle.

18:09.752 --> 18:12.752
The only thing that could
make my day more miserable

18:12.752 --> 18:15.003
is listening to an engineer
blather on

18:15.003 --> 18:17.335
about the inevitable
rise of the machines.

18:17.335 --> 18:19.044
So, you want to help?

18:19.044 --> 18:20.752
Test the initialization
for me.

18:20.752 --> 18:22.003
Roger that.

18:22.003 --> 18:23.877
Oh, I'm going to need
email confirmation,

18:23.877 --> 18:26.961
so that our future overlords
know that I chipped in.

18:26.961 --> 18:30.627
You know, once
they absorb all data.

18:30.627 --> 18:33.877
Yeah. I'll let them know.

18:33.877 --> 18:35.044
Jesus Christ.

18:35.044 --> 18:37.836
Jared Dunn's desk.

18:37.836 --> 18:40.752
Hi, this is Maggie Lewis from
Paul Revere Middle School.

18:40.752 --> 18:45.003
Jared was scheduled
to come in to talk to our
computer ed class today.

18:45.003 --> 18:46.711
I'm just calling
to let him know
I got his message.

18:46.711 --> 18:50.044
Okay, yeah.
I will pass on that very
important information.

18:50.044 --> 18:52.044
Maggie :
The kids are gonna
be so disappointed

18:52.044 --> 18:53.419
to hear he's canceling.

18:53.419 --> 18:55.752
He's really an inspiration.

18:55.752 --> 18:57.377
Yeah! Well...

18:57.377 --> 18:58.585
I mean, he's okay.

18:58.585 --> 19:00.585
He's, uh,
not a CEO or anything, but--

19:00.585 --> 19:02.377
Oh, the kids don't
know the difference!

19:02.377 --> 19:04.919
I mean, they'll look at anyone
who works in the tech business

19:04.919 --> 19:06.460
as some kind of deity.

19:06.460 --> 19:08.044
I mean,
no matter who it is.

19:08.044 --> 19:10.711
You should see
their faces when--
What time...

19:10.711 --> 19:12.253
is the class?

19:12.253 --> 19:14.211
So, there I was.

19:14.211 --> 19:17.877
Face to face
with Gavin Belson.

19:17.877 --> 19:20.919
$10 million offer
right there on the table.

19:20.919 --> 19:22.253
And you know what I said?

19:22.253 --> 19:25.627
I said no.

19:27.877 --> 19:29.419
Hey. I'm back.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.211
Did Richard step out?

19:31.211 --> 19:32.752
Yeah, I guess so.

19:32.752 --> 19:34.044
He said
he needed to take a--

19:34.044 --> 19:35.460
Holy fuck!

19:35.460 --> 19:37.544
What did you do
to your face?

19:37.544 --> 19:38.669
This?

19:38.669 --> 19:41.502
Oh, it's, uh, just
a light saline injection.

19:41.502 --> 19:42.669
It's temporary.

19:42.669 --> 19:45.003
The idea was to
distract from my nose,

19:45.003 --> 19:46.919
which scans kinda
large on camera, so.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.502
Just kinda
evens things out.

19:48.502 --> 19:50.585
What evens things out?

19:50.585 --> 19:53.128
Fuck you. Fuck you!

19:53.128 --> 19:54.419
Uh, I'm sorry.

19:54.419 --> 19:56.669
Is the consensus
that this is too much?

19:56.669 --> 19:59.419
Hey guys, Colin
from K-Hole Games
is on the phone.

19:59.419 --> 20:00.877
They-- Holy shit!

20:00.877 --> 20:03.585
Okay, I'm-- I'm starting
to feel insecure.

20:03.585 --> 20:06.086
Anyway, Colin from
K-Hole's on the phone.

20:06.086 --> 20:07.752
He said their render stopped.

20:07.752 --> 20:08.752
What?

20:08.752 --> 20:10.627
Oh, fuck.
The whole system's
bogged down.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.086
"Bogged down"?
What does that mean?

20:12.086 --> 20:13.460
Jared, can you
step away from me?

20:13.460 --> 20:14.544
Yeah. Sorry.

20:14.544 --> 20:16.377
It looks like
a DDoS attack.

20:16.377 --> 20:18.335
Not possible.
We're not open
to the outside world.

20:18.335 --> 20:20.335
Well, then something's
melting us down internally

20:20.335 --> 20:21.794
and if Colin's
losing his render,

20:21.794 --> 20:24.003
all of our developers
could be losing data.

20:24.003 --> 20:26.419
The only way to protect them
is to kick them off the network.

20:26.419 --> 20:27.836
That doesn't seem
like a great option.

20:27.836 --> 20:30.003
We have to!
Except for we can't.

20:30.003 --> 20:31.669
Oh, fuck.

20:31.669 --> 20:32.961
Richard's the only one
with the keys

20:32.961 --> 20:34.377
to put people on
or take them off,

20:34.377 --> 20:35.544
and he's not here!

20:35.544 --> 20:37.419
Okay, what do we do?
Jared, please!

20:37.419 --> 20:38.752
I cannot look at you!

20:38.752 --> 20:40.253
Okay, guys,
when they start rolling,

20:40.253 --> 20:43.419
I need you all
to keep your voices--
what the fuck?

20:43.419 --> 20:45.794
Okay, yeah.
Apparently,
it's unanimous.

20:45.794 --> 20:47.919
Here come the shame spirals.

20:47.919 --> 20:49.794
We can't have you
go on camera like that.

20:49.794 --> 20:52.169
Richard's gonna have
to go on camera.
Where is Richard?

20:52.169 --> 20:53.294
Good question.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.669
When anything goes wrong,

20:54.669 --> 20:57.211
all you ever hear is,
"Where's Richard?

20:57.211 --> 20:58.502
Where's Richard?"

20:58.502 --> 21:00.253
Well, you know
where Richard is?

21:00.253 --> 21:02.419
Kids: Doing the work!
Yes!

21:02.419 --> 21:04.711
Exactly, cool.
You guys are cool.

21:04.711 --> 21:07.169
Because honestly,
what kind of world is it

21:07.169 --> 21:09.335
when the most
famous people in tech

21:09.335 --> 21:12.544
are the Ashton Kutchers,
or the Adrian Greniers,

21:12.544 --> 21:16.544
and not the people
who engineered
this little miracle?

21:16.544 --> 21:18.669
Mmm?

21:22.502 --> 21:23.502
Oh, fuck.

21:23.502 --> 21:25.502
No, I-- oh, shit, sorry.

21:25.502 --> 21:27.585
No!
I fucked up.

21:27.585 --> 21:29.460
I mean, "fart."

21:32.003 --> 21:33.419
Denpok:
Ah, Hoover.

21:33.419 --> 21:36.211
Gavin was just telling me
about his decision

21:36.211 --> 21:38.794
to abandon the competitive
world of business,

21:38.794 --> 21:40.502
and embark
on a new journey.

21:40.502 --> 21:42.544
With Denpok's help,
I'm finally ready

21:42.544 --> 21:44.086
to pursue a more
conventional path.

21:44.086 --> 21:47.377
I'm already
looking into surrogates
to bear my children.

21:47.377 --> 21:48.877
Well...

21:48.877 --> 21:51.169
I'm also supportive
of your decision.

21:51.169 --> 21:54.169
True, but you weren't
as supportive as Denpok.

21:54.169 --> 21:55.669
Denpok was supportive
right away.

21:55.669 --> 21:57.669
I'm supportive.

21:57.669 --> 22:00.086
Look!
I brought you ice cream.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.335
Oh, dear!

22:01.335 --> 22:03.086
Is that from
Honey Tree Creamery?

22:03.086 --> 22:05.044
What?

22:05.044 --> 22:06.377
Why would you
bring that in here!

22:06.377 --> 22:08.169
Denpok:
Gavin, forgive his ignorance.

22:08.169 --> 22:11.169
He clearly does not know
that chain of ice cream concerns

22:11.169 --> 22:14.211
is owned by your
chief rival, Jeff Bezos.

22:14.211 --> 22:17.669
Or that they just opened
a new one in Half Moon Bay.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.294
Well, fuck.

22:19.294 --> 22:21.294
That rules out
Half Moon Bay.

22:21.294 --> 22:24.169
I'm sure you'll be able
to find a place
to raise your brood

22:24.169 --> 22:25.460
that is away
from Bezos.

22:25.460 --> 22:27.794
Perhaps the
Pacific Northwest?

22:27.794 --> 22:30.253
No. Gates and Paul Allen
bought up the whole region.

22:30.253 --> 22:31.585
What about Toronto?

22:31.585 --> 22:33.919
Google's redeveloping
the entire waterfront.

22:33.919 --> 22:36.919
And Richard Branson
snagged all the good islands.

22:36.919 --> 22:38.335
I could go to Mars.

22:38.335 --> 22:40.836
But that fucking Musk
will already be there!

22:40.836 --> 22:42.211
And that loser
James Cameron's

22:42.211 --> 22:44.086
all over the
bottom of the ocean.

22:44.086 --> 22:45.169
Goddammit!

22:45.169 --> 22:47.044
There's just nowhere
for me to go.

22:47.044 --> 22:48.294
Is there?

22:48.294 --> 22:50.335
Most perceptive, chela.

22:50.335 --> 22:53.003
And if the battle
is inevitable,

22:53.003 --> 22:56.585
is not Hooli the best place
from which to fight?

22:56.585 --> 22:59.086
With its
considerable resources,

22:59.086 --> 23:04.335
global influence,
and excellent executive
dining options?

23:04.335 --> 23:07.544
I am certain that
working together,

23:07.544 --> 23:08.961
Hoover and I,

23:08.961 --> 23:12.294
could provide
unparalleled support.

23:12.294 --> 23:15.253
Yes. Working together...

23:15.253 --> 23:16.669
as equals.

23:17.961 --> 23:19.502
Should I tell them
that you'll be doing

23:19.502 --> 23:21.460
the Box Three launch, sir?

23:23.961 --> 23:26.919
I guess I have no choice.

23:28.335 --> 23:30.335
♪ ♪

23:34.794 --> 23:38.253
So K-Hole's
entire render is gone?

23:38.253 --> 23:39.460
Gone.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.502
And in the time it took me
to get back here,

23:41.502 --> 23:43.253
and lock out
all the developers?

23:43.253 --> 23:45.335
A week's worth of work
went up in smoke.

23:45.335 --> 23:47.169
You picked a hell of a time
to go for a walk

23:47.169 --> 23:49.544
with your phone off,
Richard.

23:49.544 --> 23:52.169
Well, no, I-- I mean,
I told you guys.
Uh-huh.

23:52.169 --> 23:54.169
How the fuck
did this happen?

23:54.169 --> 23:56.752
You may not like it,
but I have a theory.

23:56.752 --> 23:59.419
If it has anything to do
with a robot uprising,

23:59.419 --> 24:00.961
so help me fucking God.

24:00.961 --> 24:02.211
I don't want to hear it!

24:04.128 --> 24:05.377
Alright, then.

24:08.502 --> 24:10.919
The developers are here.

24:10.919 --> 24:13.211
The mood is poor.
Ooh. Lips.

24:14.919 --> 24:16.836
Richard:
I don't know what to do.
I mean, what the fuck

24:16.836 --> 24:18.253
am I gonna say
to these people?

24:18.253 --> 24:20.335
If you want, I--
I can try to calm them down.

24:20.335 --> 24:23.086
I could teach them some
anger management techniques

24:23.086 --> 24:24.335
I learned in the system.

24:24.335 --> 24:27.086
No, you look
like a fish-man.

24:27.086 --> 24:29.211
I'm the one
they're mad at.

24:29.211 --> 24:32.003
And they should be,
I mean, look at all these...

24:32.003 --> 24:35.086
texts I missed,
and the calls and the emails.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.169
Hold on.

24:40.169 --> 24:41.752
Hold on, hold on.

24:43.128 --> 24:44.877
Hey, uh, Gilfoyle?

24:44.877 --> 24:47.003
When did the system
first start to crash?

24:47.003 --> 24:49.044
First warning light
was at...

24:50.794 --> 24:53.752
1:36 and 44 seconds, PST.

24:53.752 --> 24:55.003
Are you sure?

24:57.460 --> 25:00.044
Okay, because
if that's the case,

25:00.044 --> 25:01.961
how did I get
a private message

25:01.961 --> 25:03.669
from the Eklow
admin account

25:03.669 --> 25:05.419
seven minutes
before that?

25:06.502 --> 25:08.836
"Under attack.
Help Fiona."

25:08.836 --> 25:10.752
How did Ariel know?

25:10.752 --> 25:12.752
Maybe it wasn't from Ariel.

25:12.752 --> 25:14.877
Okay, but it's from
the Eklow account.

25:14.877 --> 25:17.086
So if Ariel didn't send it,
then who--

25:21.253 --> 25:22.752
Oh, shit.

25:22.752 --> 25:24.919
Look who bothered
to show up.

25:24.919 --> 25:27.086
You said your network
would be stable.

25:27.086 --> 25:29.585
And obviously,
that was a lie.

25:29.585 --> 25:32.711
I'm pulling all my software
from the Pied Piper network.

25:32.711 --> 25:35.128
And the rest of you
should, too. It is not--

25:35.128 --> 25:37.419
Excuse me, Ariel?
Shut the fuck up.

25:38.460 --> 25:40.585
Richard:
My fellow OctoPipers,

25:40.585 --> 25:43.335
allow me to paint
for you a scenario.

25:43.335 --> 25:47.711
Richard:
This morning,
I went to Eklow Labs.

25:47.711 --> 25:50.627
I moved Fiona
to our network.

25:50.627 --> 25:52.460
I departed.

25:52.460 --> 25:55.711
I submit to you
that soon thereafter,

25:55.711 --> 25:59.794
Ariel's pride and joy,
Fiona, began to improve.

26:00.836 --> 26:03.044
You see,
for her entire life,

26:03.044 --> 26:06.294
she was cloistered alone
with Ariel in his lab.

26:06.294 --> 26:08.335
And finally,
she was connected

26:08.335 --> 26:11.294
to an entire network
of other humans.

26:12.294 --> 26:14.086
Us, my friends.

26:14.086 --> 26:16.128
And as she became
more cognizant...

26:17.128 --> 26:18.460
more human,

26:18.460 --> 26:22.836
she started to recognize
the true intentions

26:22.836 --> 26:26.502
of her master and creator,
Mr. Eklow.

26:26.502 --> 26:30.253
You see, what she had
been trained to view

26:30.253 --> 26:33.294
as normal
interpersonal contact

26:33.294 --> 26:36.669
was finally seen
for what it truly was.

26:36.669 --> 26:38.419
A perverse...

26:38.419 --> 26:40.003
series...

26:40.003 --> 26:43.086
of clumsy gropings.

26:43.086 --> 26:45.961
The sickening advances

26:45.961 --> 26:49.086
of a handsy,
greasy little weirdo.

26:49.086 --> 26:50.669
Ariel:
Fiona.

26:50.669 --> 26:51.669
No!

26:52.669 --> 26:53.711
Oh, yes!

26:53.711 --> 26:55.877
Richard:
To wit! Exhibit A.

26:55.877 --> 26:59.044
From Eklow,
and I quote.

27:00.253 --> 27:01.711
"Under attack.

27:01.711 --> 27:03.502
Help Fiona."

27:03.502 --> 27:06.086
Yes, I was asking you
for help.

27:06.086 --> 27:08.044
Richard:
Really

27:08.044 --> 27:10.961
Allow me to read
the very same message

27:10.961 --> 27:13.627
with a slightly
different intonation.

27:13.627 --> 27:15.377
"Under attack.

27:15.377 --> 27:16.836
"Help.

27:18.377 --> 27:19.669
Fiona."

27:19.669 --> 27:23.335
Richard:
You see, you didn't
send the message.

27:23.335 --> 27:24.627
She did.

27:24.627 --> 27:26.585
And she sent another one
a minute after that.

27:26.585 --> 27:28.253
And another one
a minute after that.

27:28.253 --> 27:30.003
Seven identical messages

27:30.003 --> 27:31.460
in seven minutes,

27:31.460 --> 27:33.377
until suddenly,

27:33.377 --> 27:34.544
she fell silent.

27:36.419 --> 27:38.460
And that's when she
crashed the system?

27:38.460 --> 27:40.377
She didn't crash
the system.

27:40.377 --> 27:41.544
He did!

27:43.877 --> 27:45.377
That's absurd.

27:45.377 --> 27:46.669
Okay, hey, everyone?

27:46.669 --> 27:48.544
Let's leave right now.

27:48.544 --> 27:50.752
You see, Ariel
was so desperate

27:50.752 --> 27:52.211
to shut Fiona up,

27:52.211 --> 27:53.627
and keep her for himself,

27:53.627 --> 27:56.877
he turned all his servers
against our network

27:56.877 --> 27:58.335
to try to bring it down.

27:58.335 --> 27:59.585
Didn't you?

27:59.585 --> 28:02.836
Didn't you, you perverse,
greasy little freak?

28:02.836 --> 28:04.335
I made her!

28:04.335 --> 28:06.627
I can do anything
I want with her!

28:06.627 --> 28:08.585
Oh, shit.

28:08.585 --> 28:10.044
Gilfoyle: Mm-hmm.
Jess: Ew.

28:10.044 --> 28:12.627
Oh, gross.

28:12.627 --> 28:14.752
Look, man,

28:14.752 --> 28:19.253
Bream-Hall gave you
$112 million,

28:19.253 --> 28:21.585
and they are well
within their rights

28:21.585 --> 28:22.919
to take away your company,

28:22.919 --> 28:24.253
as well as

28:24.253 --> 28:28.377
your precious little robot.

28:28.377 --> 28:31.627
No, they can't do that.

28:31.627 --> 28:34.460
They can't
take away Fiona!

28:39.752 --> 28:42.128
Guy definitely
fucks that robot, right?

28:42.128 --> 28:43.253
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah.

28:43.253 --> 28:44.294
Yeah!

28:45.961 --> 28:47.919
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:47.919 --> 28:50.294
this was billed
as a celebration.

28:51.294 --> 28:53.794
