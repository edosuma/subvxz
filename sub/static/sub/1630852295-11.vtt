It's finally 9:00 a.m.,
Pajamas.

00:37.010 --> 00:38.023
And you know
what that means.

00:39.001 --> 00:42.015
Time to put on your Pajamas
and go back to bed?

00:42.017 --> 00:45.009
Nope, it's the local
firefighters' breakfast.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.014
Oh.

00:46.016 --> 00:49.019
I'm gonna have an omelet
with fresh herbs,

00:49.021 --> 00:51.005
and this might sound
bonkers,

00:51.007 --> 00:53.022
but I'm gonna brûlée
a grapefruit.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.009
First,
you chop it in half.

00:55.011 --> 00:57.018
Then --
-Hey, guys, just FYI.

00:57.020 --> 00:59.013
I tried something new
with my hair this morning.

00:59.015 --> 01:02.020
It was ambitious,
but ultimately, it failed.

01:02.022 --> 01:05.022
Anyway, I have to let the pomade
settle before I can emerge.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.011
So, 9:00 a.m.
firefighters' breakfast

01:08.013 --> 01:11.014
is now 10:00 a.m.
firefighters' brunch.

01:11.016 --> 01:13.011
10:00 a.m.?

01:13.013 --> 01:14.020
Alright, that's all.

01:14.022 --> 01:16.007
Ciao.

01:16.009 --> 01:19.003
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:19.005 --> 01:20.010
I called the mess hall.

01:20.012 --> 01:22.005
They are closed, so
I don't have any food.

01:22.007 --> 01:24.018
But I did write you
this comforting letter.

01:24.020 --> 01:26.015
Unless you can turn
that comforting letter

01:26.017 --> 01:31.000
into comfort food,
I'll be in my cubby.

01:33.001 --> 01:34.012
What's happening?

01:34.014 --> 01:36.017
If Oscar doesn't eat
before 9:30 a.m.,

01:36.019 --> 01:38.016
he thinks something
bad will happen.

01:38.018 --> 01:40.006
It's his superstition.

01:40.008 --> 01:43.005
Oscar, for once,
resist the cubby.

01:43.007 --> 01:45.015
Superstitions are
irrational fears.

01:45.017 --> 01:47.020
You're gonna have to face
this one day!

01:47.022 --> 01:50.007
One day, but not today.

01:54.017 --> 01:55.019
Listen, kid.

01:55.021 --> 01:57.005
Not that you asked,

01:57.007 --> 01:59.003
but I think
you're doing the right thing.

01:59.005 --> 02:02.012
Uh, people might say I'm
"superstitious" or whatever,

02:02.014 --> 02:05.011
but if I don't eat a fly
by 7:00 a.m.,

02:05.013 --> 02:08.002
I gotta stay inside
for a week.

02:08.004 --> 02:09.012
Oh, yeah?

02:09.014 --> 02:11.010
Well,
it started off as a day.

02:11.012 --> 02:12.020
Then it was two days.

02:12.022 --> 02:15.014
Then just to be safe,
I rounded it up to a week.

02:15.016 --> 02:19.005
So don't worry, kid.
We'll be safe in here together.

02:19.007 --> 02:21.014
You're in good company.

02:21.016 --> 02:24.018
You know, uh, I think I feel
my dust allergies coming on.

02:24.020 --> 02:27.006
Um, Hedgehog, uh, wait up.

02:30.021 --> 02:33.012
Sometimes life
holds you up a mirror,

02:33.014 --> 02:35.009
and you don't love
what you see.

02:35.011 --> 02:36.020
You know what I mean,
Hedgehog?

02:36.022 --> 02:39.012
Oh, you don't usually
have revelations in the cubby.

02:39.014 --> 02:40.022
This is different.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.015
You know what, Hedgehog?
This <i>is</i> <i>different.</i>

02:43.017 --> 02:45.013
Today I change my fate.

02:45.015 --> 02:47.019
Today I eat breakfast...

02:47.021 --> 02:50.008
after 9:30!

02:53.019 --> 02:55.018
Come with me
if you want to nosh.

02:55.020 --> 02:57.005
Okay.

02:57.007 --> 03:00.009
It's 9:31 a.m.
I'm officially in it now.

03:00.011 --> 03:03.016
Hedgehog, I'm going to need you
at a 3-foot distance.

03:03.018 --> 03:06.002
I could get bonked on the head
at any moment.

03:07.014 --> 03:10.001
Oscar, why do you have
this superstition anyway?

03:10.003 --> 03:12.001
No idea. I've just always
had --

03:12.003 --> 03:13.013
Incoming!

03:14.016 --> 03:17.003
Aaahh! Oof!

03:17.005 --> 03:19.002
That was totally meant
for my head.

03:19.004 --> 03:20.009
Oh, c'mon, Oscar.

03:20.011 --> 03:22.014
Somebody's probably just
playing football nearby.

03:22.016 --> 03:26.005
When have we ever seen someone
playing football on this island?

03:26.007 --> 03:28.022
Alexa plays football
literally all the time.

03:29.001 --> 03:30.011
You watched her play.

03:30.013 --> 03:33.003
You did a little cheerleading
routine for her once.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.014
Oh, yeah.

03:39.018 --> 03:40.017
What is it now?

03:40.019 --> 03:42.023
My shoelaces are loosening.

03:44.010 --> 03:46.001
Okay.

03:47.023 --> 03:49.022
Holy Arbor Day.

03:52.010 --> 03:53.007
Oh, right.

03:53.009 --> 03:54.016
It's sloughing season.

03:54.018 --> 03:57.002
Perfectly
natural.

03:57.004 --> 04:00.008
Oh, Hedgehog, if only
it were that simple.

04:06.005 --> 04:08.006
Oh, man, I'm so hungry.

04:08.008 --> 04:09.018
Hey, Oscar!

04:09.020 --> 04:11.015
Since I almost hit you
with that football,

04:11.017 --> 04:13.003
do you guys
want first dibs?

04:13.005 --> 04:15.007
Mm...may we?

04:15.009 --> 04:18.000
I have deep respect
for queue jumpers.

04:18.002 --> 04:19.007
Take what's yours.

04:20.021 --> 04:23.002
Great spiral,
by the way.

04:23.004 --> 04:24.014
Did you see that?

04:24.016 --> 04:27.019
We got to cut the line,
and Susie was nice to us?

04:27.021 --> 04:30.001
Does this mean
I faced my superstition?

04:30.003 --> 04:31.005
Did I beat it?

04:31.007 --> 04:32.011
Oh, Oscar.

04:32.013 --> 04:34.006
That's so great.

04:37.022 --> 04:39.003
Oh!

04:39.005 --> 04:42.000
Uh-oh, Hedgehog.

04:42.002 --> 04:43.009
Uh-oh nothing!

04:43.011 --> 04:45.022
We're done with this
superstition business.

04:47.013 --> 04:49.019
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

04:51.012 --> 04:54.000
Ow!

04:54.002 --> 04:55.008
That's just chance.

04:55.010 --> 04:56.015
Pinecones hit
the average person

04:56.017 --> 04:58.006
on the head
3 times a year.

04:58.008 --> 05:00.008
Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!

05:04.000 --> 05:06.001
O-M-G.
It's...

05:06.003 --> 05:07.010
Boy Band!

05:07.012 --> 05:10.016
-Oh, my gosh, Boy Band!
-Gosh, it's Boy Band!

05:10.018 --> 05:13.009
-I'm so excited.
-Yes!

05:17.009 --> 05:18.020
Thanks so much
for having us here.

05:18.022 --> 05:21.015
We're honored to be supporting
local firefighters.

05:21.017 --> 05:23.003
Ohhhh! Heh.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.010
Mm.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.016
Hm.

05:37.018 --> 05:40.022
Dang,
that tuba solo was fire.

05:42.018 --> 05:45.020
We have been looking
for some spicy beats.

05:45.022 --> 05:48.022
And, boy, you can
drop the bass.

05:51.001 --> 05:53.009
Okay, your superstition
is definitely real,

05:53.011 --> 05:56.003
and I definitely have it,
and I just ruined my life.

05:56.005 --> 05:57.009
Let's go!

05:59.018 --> 06:02.022
Since when are
superstitions contagious?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.014
This just makes no sense.

06:04.016 --> 06:06.005
It's totally illo-- Aah!

06:06.007 --> 06:07.013
Hedgehog!

06:07.015 --> 06:09.004
Aw, c'mon.

06:09.006 --> 06:12.018
Is this gonna happen every time
I don't eat breakfast by 9:30?

06:12.020 --> 06:14.000
What if I'm on the West Coast?

06:14.002 --> 06:15.010
I'm planning on going
to college.

06:15.012 --> 06:17.003
Does it adjust
from Pacific Standard

06:17.005 --> 06:18.014
to Eastern Standard Time?

06:18.016 --> 06:20.011
What if I go to Oxford?

06:20.013 --> 06:23.018
I gotta eat breakfast
by midnight.

06:23.020 --> 06:25.004
We need help.

06:25.006 --> 06:26.016
Witch help.

06:28.002 --> 06:30.013
Oscar, you and Hedgehog
are so close

06:30.015 --> 06:33.003
that you must have transferred
your superstition

06:33.005 --> 06:35.022
temporarily to Hedgehog
in your attempts to face it.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Checks out.

06:37.002 --> 06:39.011
So how do
we get rid of it?

06:39.013 --> 06:42.010
First, you gotta understand
it's not an "it."

06:42.012 --> 06:44.020
A superstition is a magical
being,

06:44.022 --> 06:46.003
just like the rest of us.

06:46.005 --> 06:48.018
Now, Hedgehog,
give me your hand.

06:50.021 --> 06:54.005
Oscar, give your superstition
a name so you understand

06:54.007 --> 06:57.003
he's someone else
totally outside of you.

06:57.005 --> 06:58.023
Um, Gerald?

06:59.001 --> 07:01.014
Perfect!
Hedgehog, you chant with me,

07:01.016 --> 07:05.017
and, Oscar,
repeat Gerald's name.

07:05.019 --> 07:09.008
Gerald.

07:09.010 --> 07:13.006
Gerald. Gerald.

07:13.008 --> 07:15.000
Gerald.

07:18.013 --> 07:19.020
Hi. I'm Gerald.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.023
Oh, it's you!
How's the gas going?

07:23.013 --> 07:27.011
Now that Gerald's out,
to get rid of him for good,

07:27.013 --> 07:30.000
all you need to do
is look him in the eye

07:30.002 --> 07:31.019
and ask him to leave.

07:31.021 --> 07:32.023
That's it?

07:33.001 --> 07:35.011
Well, you have to
butter him up first.

07:35.013 --> 07:37.010
We're talking
spaghetti dinner,

07:37.012 --> 07:40.014
cloth napkins,
Parmesan, the works.

07:40.016 --> 07:43.019
Then you pop the question,
and the next thing you know,

07:43.021 --> 07:46.021
you'll be eating breakfast
at noon if you want.

07:46.023 --> 07:49.022
Let's not get silly,
but whatever works.

07:56.003 --> 07:58.004
Perfect.
Hmm.

07:58.006 --> 08:00.001
Still missing something.

08:01.016 --> 08:03.010
Ah! That's it!

08:06.003 --> 08:07.015
Now it's perfect.

08:07.017 --> 08:09.015
Oh!
Here they come.

08:09.017 --> 08:13.000
Uh-oh,
watch the crack!

08:13.002 --> 08:14.012
Butter him up.

08:14.014 --> 08:16.019
Ask him to leave.
Ha ha.

08:25.019 --> 08:27.011
Here, Gerald,
let me butter you up.

08:27.013 --> 08:28.014
I mean...

08:28.016 --> 08:31.016
butter you up some bread!

08:31.018 --> 08:33.000
Is that salted butter?

08:33.002 --> 08:34.011
Salted butter,
heart aflutter.

08:34.013 --> 08:37.011
Oh, I'm already flirting
with high blood pressure.

08:37.013 --> 08:39.000
Can't risk it.

08:39.002 --> 08:41.013
Who needs butter?

08:41.015 --> 08:43.001
Who needs bread even?

08:43.022 --> 08:47.005
Bread on
the floor, ants galore!

08:47.007 --> 08:49.005
That's not even
a real superstition.

08:49.007 --> 08:50.020
That's just ants
doing their job.

08:50.022 --> 08:52.011
I wasn't finished.
Ants galore,

08:52.013 --> 08:54.008
your mother gets a phone call
she's been dreading.

08:54.010 --> 08:55.018
I have to sit still.

08:55.020 --> 08:57.015
As long as I sit still,
the ants can't bite me.

08:57.017 --> 09:00.004
But I didn't bring a shawl
to cover up my shoulders.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.009
I have to stand up
and clap five times,

09:02.011 --> 09:03.017
or I'll catch a cold.

09:03.019 --> 09:05.009
Oh.

09:05.011 --> 09:08.010
Gerald, stop!
This stuff's all in your head.

09:08.012 --> 09:10.022
Mm...

09:11.000 --> 09:14.006
Look, Gerald,
I'm sorry I yelled.

09:14.008 --> 09:15.010
The truth is...

09:15.012 --> 09:17.015
the reason I asked you
to dinner is...

09:17.017 --> 09:19.014
I'm asking you to leave.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.018
Leave?

09:20.020 --> 09:22.014
Yeah, I wanna wake up
in the morning

09:22.016 --> 09:24.016
and not feel terrified.

09:24.018 --> 09:25.022
Well, I'm not leaving.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.002
Why not?
You're being rude.

09:28.004 --> 09:31.006
You didn't ask me nicely.

09:31.008 --> 09:32.018
Well, how 'bout this?

09:32.020 --> 09:35.012
If you're so superstitious,
Gerald,

09:35.014 --> 09:40.000
if you don't leave me alone
by 8:15 p.m., something bad

09:40.002 --> 09:41.022
will happen to you.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.014
8:15 Eastern Time?

09:43.016 --> 09:46.003
Time zones
are always a factor.

09:46.005 --> 09:47.015
Gerald! Just do what I --

09:51.013 --> 09:52.020
Young elephant!

09:52.022 --> 09:54.004
If you don't eat your gruel

09:54.006 --> 09:57.007
by 9:30 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time,

09:57.009 --> 09:59.021
something bad
will happen to you!

10:05.023 --> 10:07.023
Great-Aunt Marianne.

10:08.001 --> 10:09.008
Who's great now?

10:09.010 --> 10:11.002
That's where you came from.

10:11.004 --> 10:13.003
You're just a tool to get me
to eat my breakfast

10:13.005 --> 10:15.008
every morning
so I don't get yelled at.

10:15.010 --> 10:16.022
I get it.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.021
She was impatient and probably
had her own agenda,

10:19.023 --> 10:21.015
just like I do right now.

10:21.017 --> 10:23.003
You know what this means,
right?

10:23.005 --> 10:24.011
No.

10:24.013 --> 10:26.022
It means you don't
have to leave!

10:27.000 --> 10:29.017
Good, 'cause I don't have
anywhere to go!

10:32.018 --> 10:35.010
So I realized I can just let
the scary and not scary

10:35.012 --> 10:37.023
live together, as long
as we understand each other.

10:38.001 --> 10:41.015
Wait, are you saying Gerald
is living with you now?

10:41.017 --> 10:45.006
Well, technically
he's not living with <i>me.</i>

10:47.012 --> 10:49.016
Well, it's just my thing,
but if the corners of a rug

10:49.018 --> 10:51.000
aren't touching both walls,

10:51.002 --> 10:53.017
then it's hard for me
to sleep at night.

10:53.019 --> 10:55.002
Hmm.

10:55.004 --> 10:58.007
Because if the corners of arug are touching both walls,

10:58.009 --> 11:01.010
it throws off my chi
for a whole room.

11:01.012 --> 11:03.016
Huh? What's chi?

11:18.007 --> 11:20.020
Salted butter, heart aflutter.
Oh.
