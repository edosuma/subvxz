00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:06.507 --> 00:09.875
Oh! Extra-thick gym socks?

00:09.877 --> 00:11.410
Thank you, dad!

00:12.880 --> 00:15.681
Okay, so somebody else
open a present.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.116
It's christmas eve
and momma's got

00:17.118 --> 00:18.217
A family newsletter to write

00:18.219 --> 00:20.219
And a big meal to cook,
so let's get this

00:20.221 --> 00:22.187
Wonderful family tradition
over with.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.691
And also,
merry christmas.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.994
It is a rooney custom
to open one gift

00:28.996 --> 00:31.296
On the morning
of christmas eve.

00:31.298 --> 00:32.331
Yeah.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.199
When joey was five,
he whined and whined

00:34.201 --> 00:37.002
And whined until mom
and dad finally let him

00:37.004 --> 00:39.171
Open one present
a day early. Hmph.

00:39.173 --> 00:42.508
He also whined when he was
six, seven, eight, and nine.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.310
And by the time
I was 13,

00:45.312 --> 00:49.048
A christmas tradition was born.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.016
I've got my own tradition.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.018
I always get mom
a book of coupons

00:53.020 --> 00:54.420
She can redeem
for cutesy things,

00:54.422 --> 00:58.257
Like smiles and hugs,
none of which cost me a dime.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.259
Christmas is a cow,
and I milk it

01:00.261 --> 01:02.361
For all it's worth.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.729
Christmas milk.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.598
<i>Feliz navidad, mis amigos.</i>

01:06.600 --> 01:08.400
Here, mommy!
Open my present!

01:08.402 --> 01:09.368
No! No, no, no, no, no!

01:09.370 --> 01:10.402
I wanna go next!

01:10.404 --> 01:12.771
I wanna see what
my little bro gave me!

01:12.773 --> 01:16.275
Momma! Momma, pleeeeease?

01:16.277 --> 01:18.911
Okay, whiney.
I mean, joey.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.679
(chuckles)

01:23.350 --> 01:24.683
(gasps)

01:24.685 --> 01:28.620
A handmade parker coupon book?!

01:28.622 --> 01:30.089
Sickness!

01:31.459 --> 01:33.625
That wasn't for joey!
That was for mom!

01:33.627 --> 01:35.527
I must've switched the boxes!

01:35.529 --> 01:37.796
-No! Joey, you got
the wrong gift.
-Wait.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.566
Okay, hold on.
A foot massage...

01:40.568 --> 01:44.470
A ten-second nose nuzzle...

01:44.472 --> 01:47.473
"parky's hug-tacular
love-a-thon"?

01:48.742 --> 01:50.809
What?

01:50.811 --> 01:53.779
You seriously gave
these coupons to joey?

01:53.781 --> 01:57.916
Okay, there is no way
parker gave me a book

01:57.918 --> 02:01.086
Full of coupons
for free snuggles on purpose.

02:01.088 --> 02:04.389
But I am not
passing up a christmas

02:04.391 --> 02:07.126
With parker as
my personal play toy.

02:08.963 --> 02:12.397
I will take the "one-minute
hug of joy," please.

02:12.399 --> 02:15.334
Joey, I'm not doing any
of those coupons for you.

02:15.336 --> 02:16.802
It's a stupid, meaningless book.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.270
Really, parker?

02:18.272 --> 02:20.405
Was it stupid and meaningless
when you gave it to me

02:20.407 --> 02:21.740
For the past eight years?

02:24.512 --> 02:27.579
Well, uh, what had--
what had happened was--

02:27.581 --> 02:30.749
Then you will have no problem
honoring those coupons.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.017
And if not...

02:32.019 --> 02:34.353
No presents
for you this christmas.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.787
-What?
-(gasps)

02:35.789 --> 02:37.356
Parker:
Fine.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.292
One "hug of joy" coming up.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.628
Father, will you time this?

02:42.630 --> 02:44.830
I wanna get
my full 60 seconds.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.167
-And go.
-(timer beeps)

02:48.169 --> 02:50.002
-Mm!

04:19.593 --> 04:21.426
-And cut!
-(ringing)

04:21.428 --> 04:23.262
That's a wrap
for the holidays.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.465
That was fantastic, liv.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.434
Ah, nothing says christmas
like a glowing alien relic!

04:30.738 --> 04:33.038
Pretty sure christmas
has never said that.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.374
(sighs)
doesn't say a lot
of things, kid.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.875
Never said I'd be
spending christmas eve

04:36.877 --> 04:38.377
Here in stevens point.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.811
Oh, what?
I thought you were

04:39.813 --> 04:41.546
Flying back to la
to see your mom.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.315
Ah, no flights until tomorrow,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.651
So what's left of the crew
is stuck here...

04:45.653 --> 04:46.818
(chuckles)

04:46.820 --> 04:49.221
Away from friends and family.

04:51.091 --> 04:54.092
No! Gemma, I'm so sorry.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.294
(sighs)

04:55.296 --> 04:57.396
Liv rooney, look at me.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.897
Closer.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.566
Gemma will be okay.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.635
Mccorky's 24-hour diner
is open, and they sell

05:03.637 --> 05:05.504
Something called
a garbage plate.

05:05.506 --> 05:09.241
Nothing says christmas
like dumpster fries!

05:10.311 --> 05:13.378
Christmas speaks way differently
to you than everyone else.

05:14.948 --> 05:18.483
Hey, why don't you guys
all have dinner at my house?

05:18.485 --> 05:19.951
Are you sure?

05:19.953 --> 05:21.753
I come to eat.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.190
Yeah. I mean,
my mom always makes

05:25.192 --> 05:27.626
The most amazing
christmas eve dinner,

05:27.628 --> 05:29.761
And I would love to share it
with my new <i> voltage </i> family.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.630
Thanks, liv!

05:31.632 --> 05:34.966
Nothing says christmas like
kindness and goodwill to others!

05:34.968 --> 05:36.668
-Was that better?
-Nailed it!

05:43.477 --> 05:47.479
Ho, ho, hello,
stevens point!

05:47.481 --> 05:49.681
It's your ol' pal,
johnny nimbus,

05:49.683 --> 05:51.783
Spreading christmas cheer
here at the ridgewood

05:51.785 --> 05:53.518
Porcu-present giveaway!

05:53.520 --> 05:54.886
Look who've I found!

05:54.888 --> 05:57.189
Hey there, santa!
How you feelin'?

06:01.662 --> 06:03.462
Christmas.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.631
Ha! We are crushing
this present wrapping, maddie!

06:06.633 --> 06:08.367
I can feel
the christmas spirit

06:08.369 --> 06:10.369
Just oozing
out of my eyeballs!

06:11.572 --> 06:13.372
Um...

06:13.374 --> 06:14.873
So hey...

06:14.875 --> 06:17.743
Before we hand out
all these presents to the kids,

06:17.745 --> 06:19.745
I got you something.

06:19.747 --> 06:20.746
Oh!

06:23.550 --> 06:25.150
(stifles laugh)

06:29.256 --> 06:30.822
What is this?

06:30.824 --> 06:32.457
(stifles laugh)

06:34.161 --> 06:36.628
That is a lump of coal.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.668
But that's what
santa gives kids
on the naughty list.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.203
I've been a good girl.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.571
Why are you giving me this?!

06:48.675 --> 06:50.275
(chortles)

06:50.277 --> 06:52.844
W... Willow, relax.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.546
It's-- it's just a joke.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.847
-It's not your real present.
-(scoffs)

06:55.849 --> 06:56.882
No.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.617
Jokes make you laugh
and feel like you have

06:58.619 --> 07:00.619
An ice cream sandwich
in your tummy.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.354
This feels like
a rotten, old shoe!

07:04.091 --> 07:05.857
No.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.427
I just like you so much

07:08.429 --> 07:10.195
That I felt comfortable
giving you a gift

07:10.197 --> 07:12.130
With an itty-bitty
mean component

07:12.132 --> 07:14.299
To its overall
hilarious makeup.

07:14.301 --> 07:16.902
Oh. Oh.

07:16.904 --> 07:20.138
-Well, then let me show you
how much I like you.
-All right.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.942
I bought you a piece
of the court

07:23.944 --> 07:25.944
Where we won
the state championship.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.680
-Aww...
-(mockingly) aww...

07:30.651 --> 07:32.384
Get it?

07:32.386 --> 07:33.952
Hilarious!

07:36.423 --> 07:38.490
(sighs)
here.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.658
Your coupon is honored.

07:39.660 --> 07:43.028
One "this is how much
I love you" bulletin board.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.831
Karen:
Oh...

07:45.833 --> 07:49.000
I don't know how
I'm gonna get everything done.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.470
I haven't even started
cooking momma's famous

07:51.472 --> 07:53.004
Christmas eve dinner yet.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.072
Well...

07:54.074 --> 07:56.842
I'd offer you my
"draw me a bath" coupon...

07:56.844 --> 07:57.776
Oh.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.945
But I kinda need it for myself.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.480
(chuckles)

08:01.482 --> 08:04.149
Double bubble me, bro.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.084
You don't have to use
all the coupons

08:06.086 --> 08:07.285
In the same day, munch.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.254
You're supposed
to spread them out!

08:09.256 --> 08:11.623
Hey, I don't know
if I'll be here tomorrow.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.258
I could get hit by a bus.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.760
Don't tease me.

08:20.501 --> 08:21.700
Hey, mom!

08:21.702 --> 08:24.703
Oh, your hair looks amazing!
Merry christmas!

08:24.705 --> 08:26.438
I invited gemma
and some of the <i> voltage </i> crew

08:26.440 --> 08:27.772
Over for dinner tonight.
Is that okay?

08:27.774 --> 08:29.374
Did I mention
your hair looks amazing?

08:29.376 --> 08:31.009
Please, please, please.
Thank you. I love you.
Hair looks great.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.677
Okay.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.980
It's going to be tough,
but there is always room

08:34.982 --> 08:37.148
For more at momma's
famous christmas eve dinner.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.884
So, now keep out
of the kitchen.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.720
Oh, and-- and tell joey to
put out the fancy toilet paper.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.355
We have guests now.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.890
(doorbell)

08:51.532 --> 08:52.831
Hello, artie.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.767
Your lord of leaping is here.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.739
What do you want?

09:00.741 --> 09:03.875
Well, I made you
a seasonal treat.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.544
Minions, reveal.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.986
An exact replica
of our future home.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.591
A gingerbread house

09:19.593 --> 09:22.093
From your ginger-haired suitor.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.830
Minions, we ride!

09:25.832 --> 09:28.333
There are stockings to be hung
by the chimney with care

09:28.335 --> 09:30.835
In hopes that
liv rooney soon will be there.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.842
All right, here are
your presents, coach santa.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.444
Watch out for lap tinklers.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.948
Where were you an hour go?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.352
Uh, hey, willow,
do you mind if you

09:47.354 --> 09:48.420
Give me back that coal?

09:48.422 --> 09:50.455
'cause I really wanna--
wanna give it to liv.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.523
Yeah, sure.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.124
And after that,
you can spit in her face

09:53.126 --> 09:54.192
And say "merry christmas."

09:55.395 --> 09:57.262
Hilarious!

10:00.867 --> 10:02.601
The coal was right here.

10:03.604 --> 10:04.936
(gasps)

10:06.707 --> 10:09.140
You don't think
we accidentally
wrapped it, do you?

10:09.142 --> 10:10.775
I hope not, or some kid
is gonna think

10:10.777 --> 10:12.877
Santa's given them coal
for christmas!

10:12.879 --> 10:13.945
(gasps)

10:13.947 --> 10:16.448
This is so bad.
We gotta find it.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.882
'cause, I mean, anyone
who gets a lump of coal

10:17.884 --> 10:19.551
Is just gonna burst
into tears.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.991
Do you even hear yourself?

10:29.830 --> 10:31.029
(phone rings)

10:34.101 --> 10:35.634
(beep)

10:35.636 --> 10:38.536
North pole,
liv rooney speaking.
(chuckles)

10:40.407 --> 10:44.876
No. Um, we did not order dinner
from wishnefsky's deli.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.979
Okay. Thank you.
Happy holidays.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.648
Watch out for reindeer!
(chuckles)

10:51.652 --> 10:53.118
Who was on the phone, honey?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.953
Um, wishnefsky's deli.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.154
They thought we ordered
dinner from them,

10:56.156 --> 10:58.189
-But I told them
we didn't need it.
-(chuckles)

10:58.191 --> 11:00.859
Take-out from a deli
on christmas eve?

11:00.861 --> 11:02.360
Who would do such a thing?

11:02.362 --> 11:03.762
What have you done?!
Give me the phone!

11:05.365 --> 11:07.499
What-- what--
mom, mom, mom!

11:07.501 --> 11:08.967
Why are you freaking out?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.502
Why would we order
dinner from a deli

11:10.504 --> 11:12.337
When you're in the kitchen
with a turkey in the oven

11:12.339 --> 11:14.339
And gravy bubbling
on the stove and--

11:14.341 --> 11:15.373
(gasps)

11:15.375 --> 11:16.741
(clatters)

11:18.945 --> 11:20.879
Oh, mother, no.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.651
Mother...

11:26.653 --> 11:28.319
Where's the turkey?

11:28.321 --> 11:29.521
Where's the bubbling gravy?

11:29.523 --> 11:30.889
Why-- why aren't you cooking?

11:30.891 --> 11:33.692
What's going on?
(laughs nervously)

11:34.861 --> 11:37.929
I hate to pull the curtain off
your childhood innocence, but...

11:39.299 --> 11:42.634
Momma's famous
christmas eve dinner...

11:42.636 --> 11:43.702
Isn't real.

11:48.709 --> 11:51.876
Oh, the deli is not answering!

11:51.878 --> 11:54.212
-The message says that
they closed early for christmas.
-(beep)

11:54.214 --> 11:55.547
Yeah, well, they
probably went home

11:55.549 --> 11:56.748
To make dinner
for their families,

11:56.750 --> 11:59.017
Unlike you,
you holiday hoodwinker!

11:59.019 --> 12:02.053
Liv, I am sorry.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.155
There are just
so many things to do

12:04.157 --> 12:07.225
This time of year,
that I... I always order dinner

12:07.227 --> 12:09.594
And pretend to cook when
I'm actually wrapping presents

12:09.596 --> 12:11.763
And-- and writing
the family newsletter.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.933
Mom, but my crew
is coming over

12:14.935 --> 12:16.434
For momma's famous
christmas eve dinner,

12:16.436 --> 12:19.104
And we don't have any food
and we don't have any time

12:19.106 --> 12:20.572
And all the stores are closed.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.107
I mean, what are
we gonna do, momma?

12:22.109 --> 12:23.558
Oh.

12:23.559 --> 12:25.008
Oh, if only there were someone
who knew their way

12:25.011 --> 12:26.945
Around a kitchen who would
do anything for you.

12:28.381 --> 12:29.447
(gasps)

12:30.784 --> 12:33.084
-Artie!
-No!

12:33.086 --> 12:36.121
-Yes!
-Wha--

12:36.123 --> 12:38.022

So, the coal...

13:04.885 --> 13:07.819
-Is in one of those presents.
-(willow sighs)

13:07.821 --> 13:09.087
What do we do?

13:09.089 --> 13:11.122
We're gonna do what
any good elf would do.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.825
We go out there
and we take presents
away from children!

13:18.064 --> 13:19.631
We need your present!
(laughs nervously)

13:19.633 --> 13:22.534
It's official elf business!

13:25.138 --> 13:26.971

Ho, ho, hold it right there!

13:32.913 --> 13:35.513
All right, let's take a trip
over to santa's workshop,

13:35.515 --> 13:36.581
Where the--

13:36.583 --> 13:39.117
What in the name
of rudolph's rosy red nose

13:39.119 --> 13:40.652
Is going on here?!

13:42.022 --> 13:46.224
Are you stealing presents
from children?!

13:47.327 --> 13:50.028
Santa gave me coal!
(cries)

13:53.600 --> 13:56.134
I didn't give
anybody coal!

13:56.136 --> 13:57.836
Maddie:
No, no, no, no, no, no,

13:57.838 --> 13:59.037
No, no, it wasn't--
that wasn't--

13:59.039 --> 14:01.039
Hi. That wasn't santa, right?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.007
Because, I mean,
santa would never do that!

14:03.009 --> 14:06.845
That-- it was--
um... Uh...

14:07.781 --> 14:09.848
-It was me.
-(gasps)

14:09.850 --> 14:11.349
You heard it here first!

14:11.351 --> 14:13.284
Maddie rooney has
ruined christmas!

14:13.286 --> 14:15.086
I...

14:18.491 --> 14:22.093
Minions, show me what you found
in the rooney cupboards.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.565
Eight cans
of yellow wax beans

14:27.567 --> 14:29.100
And a bag
of oyster crackers?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.137
For shame, mrs. Rooney!

14:33.139 --> 14:34.239
(clicks)

14:34.241 --> 14:36.708
Holiday newsletter.
No time to listen.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.476
Liv, when did
they offer you <i> voltage</i> ?

14:38.478 --> 14:40.178
Was it September or August?

14:40.180 --> 14:41.813
And when did I buy
that dead guy suit

14:41.815 --> 14:43.581
That turned joey cool
for a day?

14:48.054 --> 14:49.988
So, artie,
do you think that

14:49.990 --> 14:51.923
You could pull off
christmas eve dinner?

14:51.925 --> 14:56.327
Well, this is a tall order
and I'm a short man...

14:58.231 --> 15:00.865
But there is one thing
that would put a lift

15:00.867 --> 15:02.133
In my shoes...

15:03.536 --> 15:06.905
A holiday card picture
with you on my arm.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.776
We can look back on it fondly
years from now...

15:11.778 --> 15:13.511
When we're married.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.780
Fine.

15:15.782 --> 15:18.116
-She said yes!
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.752
To the-- to the one--
the one photo. Not the...

15:20.754 --> 15:22.086
Not the marriage.

15:22.088 --> 15:25.089
Well, I have
a holiday miracle
to make.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.157
Taylor minion.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.193
Go to my root cellar
and get me everything

15:29.195 --> 15:30.295
We don't need
for new year's eve.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.463
Joel minion.

15:32.465 --> 15:36.634
Fetch me the finest turkey
in stevens point.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.436
Other one.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.171

16:04.097 --> 16:06.130
Season's greetings,

16:06.132 --> 16:07.432
(both chuckle)

16:07.434 --> 16:11.069
Oh, you guys are in
for such a treat!

16:12.639 --> 16:16.107
I just cashed in a coupon

16:16.109 --> 16:20.078
For "parker's christmas
candy cane cavalcade"!

16:21.181 --> 16:24.148
I have no idea
what you're taking about,

16:24.150 --> 16:26.217
But I am in.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.319
Parker!

16:29.823 --> 16:31.155
It's showtime.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.780
Oh. Huh.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.683
Well, who could that be?

17:01.321 --> 17:02.387
(gasps)

17:04.824 --> 17:06.124
What?!

17:06.126 --> 17:09.360
I invited the girls
from your class

17:09.362 --> 17:12.330
To come watch
you dance whilst dressed

17:12.332 --> 17:14.265
Like a cute,
little candy cane!

17:15.335 --> 17:16.401
(giggling)

17:16.403 --> 17:17.735
Joey!

17:17.737 --> 17:22.373
I am not dancing
in front of kristin alvez!

17:22.375 --> 17:23.541
Hey, kristin.

17:25.211 --> 17:28.112
Nothing under that tree
is worth humiliating myself.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.555
(crying)

17:37.557 --> 17:41.159
Hey, little girl...

17:41.161 --> 17:42.593
Don't be sad.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.296
But santa gave me coal.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.200
Um... You know what?

17:49.202 --> 17:51.169
Actually, can I take
a look at this?

17:52.672 --> 17:54.772
Uh-huh... Oh.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.207
Wow.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.209
Just as I suspected.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.211
This is not actually coal.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.880
This is the...

18:02.882 --> 18:06.017
Merry magic...

18:06.019 --> 18:07.518
-Christmas rock!
-(gasps)

18:10.023 --> 18:11.289
What's that?

18:11.291 --> 18:13.191
(chuckles)
what's that?

18:13.193 --> 18:16.360
Obviously, it means
you win a prize.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.696
Yeah.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.731
The biggest prize of all!

18:20.733 --> 18:22.733
A prize?

18:22.735 --> 18:24.335
What prize?

18:25.572 --> 18:27.872
Both:
Um...

18:29.275 --> 18:30.541
-It, uh, you...
-Um...

18:30.543 --> 18:31.809
You win a...

18:31.811 --> 18:33.277
-Um...
-You, um...

18:33.279 --> 18:34.345
Both:
Santa?

18:35.949 --> 18:38.116
Oh. Uh...

18:38.118 --> 18:39.217
Uh...

18:39.219 --> 18:42.453
You get to do the weather
with johnny nimbus!

18:43.790 --> 18:45.123
Yay!

18:45.125 --> 18:47.492
I'm gonna make it
sunny all week!

18:47.494 --> 18:49.594
(chuckles)
go ahead, kid.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.162
I make it up
all the time.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.500
Hello, stevens point!

18:55.502 --> 18:58.302
This is your ol' pal, raina,
with the weather.

19:01.941 --> 19:04.775
Hey, girls, can you
hold down the throne
for a minute?

19:04.777 --> 19:07.111
Santa sees some cookies
with his name on it.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.846
Yeah. Hey, save some room

19:08.848 --> 19:11.816
-For momma's famous
christmas eve dinner!
-(sighs)

19:11.818 --> 19:14.585
Ah, dinner with
family and friends.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.953
That sounds a whole lot better

19:15.955 --> 19:17.321
Than reheating a burrito

19:17.323 --> 19:18.456
And acting surprised
when you open

19:18.458 --> 19:20.258
A present you gave
to yourself.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.428
Well, johnny,
why don't you come
to my house for dinner?

19:24.430 --> 19:27.298
I mean, my mom always makes
the most amazing meal.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.367
You'd do that for me?

19:29.369 --> 19:30.801
Yeah. I mean...

19:30.803 --> 19:32.103
I mean, it's christmas, right?

19:32.105 --> 19:35.439
Oh, and johnny, I got you
a little somethin'.

19:35.441 --> 19:38.442
Oh, you elves are
gonna make me cry.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.812
This is too much.
Really, I-- (gasps)

19:41.814 --> 19:43.181
(giggles)

19:44.350 --> 19:45.416
Coal?!

19:46.452 --> 19:48.386
I'm already in
an emotional state!

19:48.388 --> 19:50.454
(both laugh)

19:52.325 --> 19:53.691
I get it now!

19:53.693 --> 19:55.293
-It's hilarious!
-Right?!

20:01.668 --> 20:02.967
(overlapping chatter)

20:08.741 --> 20:11.542
Oh, you did it, artie!

20:11.544 --> 20:13.544
Dinner looks amazing.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.381
I'll see you tomorrow for
our holiday card photo shoot.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.549
Artie, wait.

20:25.658 --> 20:29.093
You really saved me today...

20:29.095 --> 20:33.864
And I was wondering
if you might want to join

20:33.866 --> 20:36.267
Me and my family
for dinner tonight.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.403
Thank you, liv.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.571
That means a lot.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.976
I'd love to, but I'm not
dressed for dinner.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.413
And now I am!

20:53.086 --> 20:55.253
Minions, leave us.

20:55.255 --> 20:57.622
We'll do christmas bonuses
tomorrow with my family

20:57.624 --> 20:59.590
While opening presents
in our pjs.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.295
(sighs)
okay.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.030
Smells great, kiddies.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.432
Okay, now out of my way.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.568
I swear,
I have worked so hard.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.636
(chuckles)

21:13.873 --> 21:17.675
Here comes momma's famous
christmas eve dinner!

21:21.214 --> 21:23.247
Thanks for having us, liv.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.649
Can someone please
pass the gravy?

21:24.651 --> 21:25.783
Oh.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.218
I like to start
with that as a base

21:27.220 --> 21:28.886
And then pile
the food on top.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.188
Told you.
I come to eat.

21:33.326 --> 21:37.061
-The gravy is on its way-vy.
-Oh.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.630
Many thanks again
for having me.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.766
Haven't had this much
fun on christmas eve

21:41.768 --> 21:44.402
Since I covered
that torrential rainstorm

21:44.404 --> 21:45.936
In fond du lac.

21:45.938 --> 21:48.172
I used to be a storm chaser.

21:48.174 --> 21:49.674
Tell me everything.

21:50.777 --> 21:53.811
Did you just ask johnny nimbus
to talk about the weather?

21:53.813 --> 21:56.113
'cause it's 82
and sunny in cancun,

21:56.115 --> 21:57.481
And we can be there
by new year's.

22:00.353 --> 22:01.686
<i>-Muy caliente.</i>
-Oh.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.626
Weird.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.294
Anyway...

22:10.296 --> 22:13.297
I'm sorry I got
so carried away
with those coupons.

22:13.299 --> 22:16.167
I told mom to give you
all your presents.

22:16.169 --> 22:17.668
Thanks, but I get it.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.338
I'm too old to still be giving
coupon books as gifts.

22:20.340 --> 22:23.040
Maybe, but I got you something
to make it up to you.

22:26.012 --> 22:29.380
A "free hugs from joey
for life" coupon?
