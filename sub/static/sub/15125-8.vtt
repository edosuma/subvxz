WEBVTT

00:04.272 --> 00:05.406
Grandma!

00:07.075 --> 00:08.909
(screams)

00:08.942 --> 00:10.010
Oh, it's just Grandma.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.145
It's okay, it's just Grandma.

00:11.179 --> 00:12.580
I'm sorry, honey.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.915
There's nothing to be
scared of, I promise.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.884
Except the inevitable
march of time.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.652
I just forgot you
were coming over.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.721
I really need to start
writing things down.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.656
No, she wasn't
supposed to come over.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.992
Good, 'cause I wasn't about
to start writing things down.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.394
Why the special visit?

00:26.427 --> 00:27.528
We got a problem.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.762
Jimmy fell asleep
at work today.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.964
*

00:37.138 --> 00:39.207
Jimmy!

00:40.141 --> 00:41.375
Jimmy!

00:41.409 --> 00:43.611
Wake up! Jimmy!

00:43.644 --> 00:45.546
I guess Hope's been going
into their bed at night.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.781
So I brought her here so Jimmy
could go home and take a nap.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.184
Hope's been sleeping
in their bed?

00:50.218 --> 00:52.753
That's gotta put a real
damper on the old S-E...

00:53.587 --> 00:54.555
Can she spell yet?

00:54.588 --> 00:55.889
Uh, I don't know.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.425
Better safe than sorry.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.560
Look! (mock gasps)

00:59.593 --> 01:02.396
Pennies!
Pennies!

01:02.430 --> 01:04.132
They're not
having sex.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.633
Trouble in
the bedroom

01:05.666 --> 01:07.568
is the number one
sign for divorce.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.271
According to Oprah's
O magazine, by Oprah.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.473
Divorce? You really think
it could be that serious?

01:12.506 --> 01:13.941
If they're sleeping
with the baby

01:13.974 --> 01:16.076
in the room, it's
only a matter of time

01:16.110 --> 01:18.912
before Jimmy's just
another loser divorcÃ©

01:18.946 --> 01:20.981
who's picking up women
at the ice cream parlor

01:21.014 --> 01:22.550
next to the
fat ladies' gym.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.051
Oh, we can't have that.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.453
We've worked too hard
to get Sabrina to believe

01:25.486 --> 01:26.820
that Jimmy's the best
she could do.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.722
Mmm...
I'll tell you
how you fix it.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.058
You keep the sex poison here

01:31.091 --> 01:32.793
as long as you can.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.262
"Sex poison"?

01:34.295 --> 01:35.896
That's what I call children.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.798
She's right. Maybe we
should keep Hope overnight

01:37.831 --> 01:40.168
to give Jimmy and Sabrina
some alone time.
You're right.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.402
We should.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.736
It's what good
parents would do.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.272
Me and my big mouth.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.640
Now Paw Paw and I
will have to sneak a quickie

01:46.674 --> 01:48.809
in the rumble seat tonight.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.012
Whoo!

01:52.045 --> 01:53.414
* Here we go

01:53.447 --> 01:56.417
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:56.450 --> 01:58.586
So...

01:58.619 --> 01:59.853
did you
and Sabrina

01:59.887 --> 02:00.954
enjoy your night
alone last night?

02:00.988 --> 02:02.156
Yeah, it was great.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.258
I think
I tweaked my neck.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.594
Sabrina had me doing
all sorts of crazy stuff.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.795
Really?

02:07.828 --> 02:09.663
Well, with Hope
out of the house,

02:09.697 --> 02:12.366
we could get down to all
the dirty stuff on our list.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.367
You have a list?

02:13.401 --> 02:14.502
It was
exhausting.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.103
We did it all.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.172
You know, I shampooed the carpet
for, like, an hour.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.674
She cleaned
the chimney.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.476
It was filthy.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.478
We were both pretty
sore this morning,

02:24.512 --> 02:27.648
but, uh, she still had me
mulch her flower box.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.016
Wow.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.518
Yeah, well, next time
you guys take Hope,

02:30.551 --> 02:32.486
I'm gonna oil up her chest
in our bedroom.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.687
Now you're talking.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.022
It takes a while.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.690
She hasn't really taken
care of it in years.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.826
It's kind of gross
underneath.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.895
Well, still,
a chest is a chest.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.497
It is a nice chest.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.866
It's not as old
or as beautiful as Maw Maw's.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.668
(gags quietly)

02:47.701 --> 02:48.736
I'm sorry...

02:48.769 --> 02:50.838
when you say "oil up her chest,"

02:50.871 --> 02:52.240
what exactly do you mean?

02:52.273 --> 02:53.807
I mean just get some
linseed oil and polish up

02:53.841 --> 02:55.676
the antique chest
that Sabrina's uncle left us.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.311
Oh...
What did you think?

02:57.345 --> 02:58.679
I thought you were talking about

02:58.712 --> 03:00.548
you and Sabrina
having weird sex,

03:00.581 --> 03:01.982
and then, briefly, you wanting

03:02.015 --> 03:03.651
to feel up
your great-grandmother.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.152
What? No.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.421
We do not have weird sex.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.889
Well, just so
you know,

03:08.922 --> 03:11.259
if you were or weren't
having weird sex--

03:11.292 --> 03:12.993
or any sex--

03:13.026 --> 03:15.095
you're my son and
Sabrina's my daughter

03:15.128 --> 03:17.365
and I'm always happy
to hear about it.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.867
Dad?

03:19.900 --> 03:22.770
As far as our sex life
is concerned...
Yeah?

03:22.803 --> 03:24.605
...there is nothing to discuss.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.006
Nothing?
Nothing.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.675
Nothing.
Nothing?

03:27.708 --> 03:30.110
Nothing. They
are in trouble.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.079
They had the whole house
to themselves last night,

03:32.112 --> 03:33.414
and all they did were chores.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.182
I knew they were in a sex slump.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.084
Sabrina was wearing shorts
the other day,

03:37.117 --> 03:39.253
and her thighs looked
like she'd been rolling around

03:39.287 --> 03:40.621
on the floor of a barbershop.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.789
Those are not
the legs

03:41.822 --> 03:43.757
of a woman who is
sexually active.

03:43.791 --> 03:44.958
What do we do?

03:44.992 --> 03:46.694
I don't know...

03:46.727 --> 03:48.396
but we need to shake
things up somehow.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.230
They inherited that house,
and ever since then,

03:50.264 --> 03:51.599
they've had it
way too easy.

03:51.632 --> 03:52.966
No landlord,

03:53.000 --> 03:54.435
no mortgage...

03:54.468 --> 03:57.204
Every young marriage
needs a little chaos.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.206
Think about how it was
when we started out.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.309
We didn't even have
enough gas money

04:01.342 --> 04:02.376
for your dirt bike.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.144
Later, loser!
Hey!

04:04.177 --> 04:06.414
(guys laughing)
It's okay, sweetie.

04:08.115 --> 04:11.719
Sometimes we barely knew where
our food was gonna come from.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.120
VIRGINIA:
I can't eat this now.

04:13.153 --> 04:16.457
It's covered in
mustard diarrhea.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.795
(sighs happily)

04:25.433 --> 04:27.601
VIRGINIA:
And that unstable base

04:27.635 --> 04:29.903
is what forced us
to hold onto each other

04:29.937 --> 04:31.238
even tighter.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.741
Oh... oh...

04:33.774 --> 04:35.843
Yeah.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.345
Oh, that feels good.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.979
Oh, cramp!

04:39.012 --> 04:40.814
Cramp!
Ooh.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.351
Oh, yeah.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.953
That feels great.
That feels great.

04:56.364 --> 04:59.467
Burt, it was uncertainty
that kept us together.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.036
Every marriage
needs stress.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.305
Stress leads to tension,

05:05.339 --> 05:07.641
tension leads to massage,

05:07.675 --> 05:09.276
and no matter what,

05:09.309 --> 05:12.045
massage always
leads to sex.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.381
That's why I
can't believe

05:13.414 --> 05:14.815
they have those
chairs in the mall.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.316
We can't just sit back
and let this happen.

05:16.350 --> 05:17.851
We gotta get in there

05:17.885 --> 05:20.488
and shake up Jimmy
and Sabrina's foundation.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.457
Are you doing one of
your crazy plans

05:23.491 --> 05:25.893
where you dress up
in costumes

05:25.926 --> 05:27.795
and leave me out of it?
No, Maw Maw.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.498
But if it turns into one
of those, we'll let you know.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.372
This is perfect.

05:38.406 --> 05:39.873
When they can't have
coffee in the morning,

05:39.907 --> 05:41.375
they are gonna
be delirious.

05:41.409 --> 05:42.810
And then when
they can't find

05:42.843 --> 05:44.378
their remotes or
their cell phones,

05:44.412 --> 05:45.746
they're gonna be going
at it like rabbits.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.381
What'd you do?

05:47.415 --> 05:49.383
I lowered the setting on
the water pressure regulator.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.918
It's gonna drive Jimmy crazy

05:50.951 --> 05:52.553
when he can't get the shampoo
out of his hair.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.187
When he runs out of
the shower all stressed,

05:54.221 --> 05:55.322
he's gonna already
be naked!

05:55.355 --> 05:57.257
You're such
a genius!

05:57.290 --> 05:58.892
(pipes clanging)

05:58.926 --> 06:00.360
What's that?

06:00.394 --> 06:01.562
I don't know.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.535
What is happening?!

06:08.536 --> 06:10.270
Tsunami!

06:10.303 --> 06:11.505
(both screaming)

06:11.539 --> 06:12.673
(Jimmy and Sabrina screaming)

06:12.706 --> 06:14.542
Did you lower
the pressure...

06:14.575 --> 06:15.909
or raise it?

06:15.943 --> 06:17.611
Lefty loosey...

06:17.645 --> 06:18.912
righty tighty...

06:18.946 --> 06:20.714
Wait, is that from
my perspective

06:20.748 --> 06:22.315
or the pipe's
perspective?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.720
(screams)

06:26.754 --> 06:28.188
Okay! Jimmy...

06:28.221 --> 06:29.289
just calm down.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.357
We just need
to find the valve

06:30.390 --> 06:31.358
to shut off
the water.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.560
Are you sure

06:32.593 --> 06:34.061
that this isn't poop water?

06:34.094 --> 06:36.530
(screams)

06:36.564 --> 06:38.432
It's in my mouth!

06:41.935 --> 06:44.304
Thanks for letting us
crash here tonight.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.106
Of course.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.374
You can stay here any time.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.643
Well... but don't
get too comfortable.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.145
We just threw out
our carbon monoxide detector

06:52.179 --> 06:53.447
'cause it was beeping too much.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.915
And, uh...
we're having

06:54.948 --> 06:58.285
a bit of a
poisonous spider problem.
Yes.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.620
Uh, try not
to snore

06:59.653 --> 07:00.754
when you sleep,
'cause they take that

07:00.788 --> 07:01.722
as a sign
of aggression.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.756
VIRGINIA:
So...

07:02.790 --> 07:04.291
your wall exploded?

07:04.324 --> 07:06.059
Talk about stressful.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.629
If I was you, I'd be afraid
of walls the rest of my life.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.430
I'd be clinging
to Virginia.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.766
Honestly, it's really not as big
of a deal as it sounds like.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.301
Yeah, it was just
a burst water main.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.236
SABRINA:
We just kind of
assessed the damage,

07:16.269 --> 07:17.404
made a little to-do list.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.506
And we saw that
the problem, uh,

07:18.539 --> 07:19.640
wasn't that
big of a deal.

07:19.673 --> 07:20.774
It wasn't?

07:20.808 --> 07:21.775
What about the
water damage?

07:21.809 --> 07:23.110
Water turns to mold,

07:23.143 --> 07:24.745
mold turns to asbestos,

07:24.778 --> 07:27.280
asbestos turns to lead.

07:27.314 --> 07:28.849
You know, we've got insurance,
so we're gonna be fine.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.183
Sabrina, did you buy
that insurance?

07:30.217 --> 07:32.152
Jimmy says you spend
too much money.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.787
What do you think about
Jimmy's big mouth, Sabrina?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.022
We actually got

07:35.055 --> 07:37.157
a very good deal
on our insurance, so...

07:37.190 --> 07:38.191
Yeah, yeah.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.493
I rarely say
this, but, uh...

07:39.527 --> 07:40.594
thank God for Wyatt.

07:40.628 --> 07:41.795
Wyatt?

07:41.829 --> 07:43.096
Oh, that hot piece of ass

07:43.130 --> 07:44.131
Sabrina used to sleep with

07:44.164 --> 07:45.198
before she settled for

07:45.232 --> 07:46.534
this sack of mashed potatoes?

07:46.567 --> 07:48.435
Maw Maw...
I told you, we're not doing

07:48.468 --> 07:49.503
costumes this time.

07:49.537 --> 07:50.771
Anyway...

07:50.804 --> 07:52.039
back when Wyatt
and I were together,

07:52.072 --> 07:53.273
his dad got my family
a really good deal

07:53.306 --> 07:54.207
on homeowner's
insurance

07:54.241 --> 07:55.609
just to
impress me.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.978
I'm gonna hit the hay.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.647
Yeah, I'm gonna call it, too.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.114
(sighs)

08:01.148 --> 08:03.717
VIRGINIA:
You're sleeping
out here?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.519
Why don't you let
Hope sleep with us

08:05.553 --> 08:07.688
and you can go sleep
in the bedroom with Sabrina?

08:07.721 --> 08:09.056
Your wife.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.691
And lover.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.459
In that little twin bed?
(chuckles)

08:12.492 --> 08:14.294
We'd be right
on top of each other.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.896
On top of your wife.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.397
And lover.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.465
JIMMY:
Nah.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.333
It's been a crazy night.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.335
We should just get some sleep.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.640
It's worse than we thought.

08:26.674 --> 08:27.808
They're not even
sleeping in the same bed.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.176
He's sleeping on the couch.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.378
All this security
is driving them apart.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.913
I mean, insurance?

08:32.946 --> 08:35.583
Have you ever heard of anything
so irresponsible?

08:35.616 --> 08:36.984
I know.

08:37.017 --> 08:37.918
Sometimes I feel closest to you

08:37.951 --> 08:39.152
when things suck the most.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.354
Exactly. Stability
is the enemy.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.724
We need to shake them up
on a deeper level.

08:43.757 --> 08:47.360
A body in the ocean
tends to remain in the ocean.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.062
What do we do?

08:49.096 --> 08:51.531
It has to be something
they don't have insurance for.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.900
What if we crash their car?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.201
No, that won't work.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.103
Obama made a law

08:56.136 --> 08:58.505
where everybody has to have
affordable car insurance.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.873
It's called Obama-Car.

08:59.907 --> 09:00.941
Well, I'm out.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.409
Their world's too big for me.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.878
But they're not in
their world anymore, Burt.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.715
They're in ours.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.796
Oh, don't look at
me like that.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.264
Your mother's so
scared of spiders,

09:24.297 --> 09:26.066
she sleeps with a
panty ho on her head.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.604
This is all a dream.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.272
Burt!

09:32.305 --> 09:33.641
I got it.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.908
Sabrina's checkbook.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.276
Did you take care
of Jimmy's wallet?

09:36.309 --> 09:38.078
Yep. Gone.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.413
VIRGINIA:
You burn it?

09:40.447 --> 09:41.448
Jimmy will
have no choice

09:41.481 --> 09:42.582
but to turn to Sabrina

09:42.616 --> 09:44.384
for some sweet love
and consoling.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.786
We're trying to
give him stress

09:45.819 --> 09:47.254
that leads to
a massage,

09:47.287 --> 09:49.456
not stress that leads
to a heart attack.

09:49.489 --> 09:50.724
You said to get
rid of it,

09:50.758 --> 09:51.925
because without access
to their money,

09:51.959 --> 09:53.126
they'd feel less secure.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.995
I meant you should
hide his wallet

09:55.028 --> 09:56.229
for a little while.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.131
Not burn all his money.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.233
What is wrong with me?

10:00.267 --> 10:02.836
I always take
these things too far.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.104
I'm like a bull in a china shop

10:04.137 --> 10:06.006
who likes to burn things
in a barbeque.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.174
Oh...

10:07.207 --> 10:08.742
It's okay, honey.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.078
It's an easy mistake.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.747
Well, that feels good.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.282
Really good.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.857
SABRINA:
What do you mean,
it's not here?

10:23.891 --> 10:25.325
JIMMY:
I mean I had it,
and now it's gone.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.493
Burt, wake up!

10:26.526 --> 10:28.595
There's pudding everywhere!

10:28.628 --> 10:29.596
We've been robbed!

10:29.629 --> 10:31.965
(quietly):
It worked.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.835
Are you sure you had it
in your pants?

10:34.868 --> 10:36.603
Of course
I'm sure.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.938
Uh, what are you looking for?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.039
Jimmy lost his wallet.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.507
JIMMY:
I didn't lose it.

10:40.540 --> 10:41.842
I know that I had it last night.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.610
It's my fault.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.279
I forgot to lock
the front door last night.

10:46.313 --> 10:50.617
Damn me and my small-town,
mid-century American values.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.552
It's okay.
Just try to relax.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.054
Not now, Burt.
Shh...

10:54.087 --> 10:55.622
JIMMY:
I had everything in my wallet.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.158
I had my driver's license,
ATM card,

10:58.191 --> 10:59.359
sub club.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.661
Aw, man--
my lucky 50-cent piece!

11:01.695 --> 11:03.630
Oh, no.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.699
What? What is it?

11:07.267 --> 11:09.069
I had $500 in my wallet.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.872
What? Jimmy, I raised you never
to have that kind of money.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.307
You had $500?

11:14.341 --> 11:16.543
This is a lot worse

11:16.576 --> 11:19.479
than I originally thought.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.081
Jimmy, what were you doing

11:21.114 --> 11:22.716
with $500?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.517
JIMMY: Well, I got our
emergency envelope

11:24.551 --> 11:26.219
from the desk last night

11:26.253 --> 11:27.988
when we were leaving the house.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.356
Wait, Jimmy, there
was only $20

11:29.389 --> 11:31.825
in that emergency envelope.
Are you sure?

11:31.859 --> 11:33.727
I'm positive-- I went to the
bank and I deposited the rest

11:33.761 --> 11:34.928
of it last night
'cause I didn't think

11:34.962 --> 11:36.229
we should have
that much cash around.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.031
Oh, you're kidding.
That's amazing.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.267
I'm not a loser!
SABRINA: Of course
you're not a loser.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.002
Let's go to the mall
and we'll get you a new wallet

11:42.035 --> 11:43.370
with the Velcro and the little
plastic picture things

11:43.403 --> 11:44.537
you like to put
your sugar packets in.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.742
Oh, we were this close.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.844
I can't believe
she deposited the money.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.346
Once again, the little guy
gets screwed by the banks.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.748
First insurance, now
she's teaching him

11:54.782 --> 11:56.750
to be responsible
with money.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.085
She's ruining
their marriage.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.119
I knew she was no good.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.754
Or too good...
or whatever.

12:00.788 --> 12:03.757
We just haven't found
her chaos button yet.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.059
Ooh, I bet I know

12:06.093 --> 12:08.728
just the way to push it.

12:08.762 --> 12:12.399
So a priest walks into
a bar and he says...

12:12.432 --> 12:14.201
What the hell is
Wyatt doing here?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.069
I don't get it.
Is Wyatt the bartender?

12:16.103 --> 12:18.438
No, Wyatt is your ex-boyfriend.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.873
(laughs)

12:19.907 --> 12:21.241
Oh, now I get it.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.810
Hello, Sabrina.

12:22.843 --> 12:26.546
What are you doing here?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.915
He's selling us insurance.

12:27.948 --> 12:28.982
Yeah.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.483
We were so impressed with yours,

12:30.517 --> 12:33.153
we thought it was about time
we got some ourselves.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.421
You sell insurance now?

12:34.454 --> 12:36.089
I sell dreams.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.390
The dream of a flood,

12:37.424 --> 12:39.492
a fire,
the loss of a loved one,

12:39.526 --> 12:40.828
where you can
cash in big.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.329
We just bought
every policy he sells.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.931
You can never be too safe.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.165
In fact, if there's insurance
for being too safe,

12:45.198 --> 12:46.733
we'll take that, too.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.302
Anyway, when we heard
what a great deal you got,

12:49.336 --> 12:52.105
we thought: Who better
to buy insurance from

12:52.139 --> 12:54.107
than the guy
Sabrina thinks so highly of,

12:54.141 --> 12:56.109
she almost picked him
over Jimmy?

12:56.143 --> 12:57.144
Almost.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.245
We're still young.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.913
Okay, well, that...

12:59.947 --> 13:01.181
that's-that's fine.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.649
You know, I think
it's really great

13:02.682 --> 13:04.584
that you guys are
finally protecting...

13:04.617 --> 13:05.953
all this.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.287
And, uh...

13:07.320 --> 13:08.588
I think we will
definitely find a way

13:08.621 --> 13:10.023
to get comfortable with it.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.692
Wyatt, now that Jimmy
and Sabrina are home,

13:12.725 --> 13:15.528
would you like
to join us for dinner?

13:15.562 --> 13:16.864
Yes.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.565
I would love to.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.973
Maw Maw, I told you
we're not doing costumes.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.211
Dinner's up
in five minutes.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.545
Why don't I
go help Dad

13:32.579 --> 13:34.381
with the hot dogs?
He's good.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.383
So, Wyatt,
why don't you tell us

13:36.416 --> 13:37.550
how you got involved

13:37.584 --> 13:39.486
in the exciting world
of insurance?

13:39.519 --> 13:43.223
Well, I needed some security
after Sabrina plunged a dagger

13:43.256 --> 13:44.958
into my heart by choosing
to spend her life

13:44.992 --> 13:45.993
with a far lesser man.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.327
Uh, one day,

13:47.360 --> 13:48.361
my dad asked me to join

13:48.395 --> 13:49.296
the family insurance business.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.463
So I started protecting

13:50.497 --> 13:51.664
people's futures

13:51.698 --> 13:52.665
the way I should've
been protecting

13:52.699 --> 13:53.666
my fragile heart

13:53.700 --> 13:55.635
from a cold, cold bitch

13:55.668 --> 13:56.904
who shall go unnamed.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.805
Hey, Burt, how are
those dogs coming?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.308
Well, whatever
happened, Wyatt,

14:01.341 --> 14:03.510
it-it sounds like it
worked out for the best.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.677
Not all of it.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.346
Have you ever met
a cocaine dealer

14:06.379 --> 14:07.380
who took credit cards?

14:07.414 --> 14:08.548
I did.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.717
It... it kind of
ruined my credit.

14:10.750 --> 14:14.387
I'm... having a tough time
finding someplace to live.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.423
Hey, you need a place to live?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.858
We got space for you here.
I don't think that...

14:18.892 --> 14:20.160
Yeah!

14:20.193 --> 14:21.528
You should take Jimmy's room.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.863
The last guy
who lived there got Sabrina.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.565
So...

14:25.598 --> 14:27.500
who knows?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.769
And if it tips you
one way or the other,

14:29.802 --> 14:32.672
sometimes I get confused
which door is the bathroom.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.074
JIMMY:
Look, Wyatt.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.910
I'm sorry that Sabrina
chose me over you.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.878
And-and that you're
selling insurance.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.413
And I'm sorry that, uh,

14:40.447 --> 14:42.249
you don't have
a place to live.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.717
But there is no way
that you can live

14:44.751 --> 14:46.686
in my old room.
Right, Sabrina?

14:46.719 --> 14:49.056
I think it's a great idea!
What?

14:49.089 --> 14:50.457
Well, Wyatt needs
a place to stay,

14:50.490 --> 14:52.292
and your parents
have the space.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.760
I think we can figure
something out.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.696
Uh, can I talk
to you for a sec?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.165
Of course.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.737
We lit the fuse, now it's just
time to watch the bomb go off.

15:04.771 --> 15:08.308
I bet they're falling into
each other's arms in seconds.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.377
We are such good parents.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.512
Shh.

15:13.780 --> 15:14.982
(groans)

15:15.015 --> 15:16.449
Damn, I can't hear a
word they're saying.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.251
I think it's pretty obvious
what they're saying.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.087
(imitating Sabrina):
That poor guy needs
a home over there.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.321
It doesn't matter
that he's...

15:21.354 --> 15:22.589
he's much more
handsome than you.

15:22.622 --> 15:23.790
(scoffs)

15:23.823 --> 15:25.158
(imitating Jimmy):
Well, I can't argue

15:25.192 --> 15:26.293
with how handsome he is,

15:26.326 --> 15:27.727
but... (scoffs)

15:27.760 --> 15:30.497
I-I will argue with him
sleeping in my old room.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.299
I am very angry!

15:32.332 --> 15:35.635
Ooh, I like it
when you're angry.

15:35.668 --> 15:36.903
I feel something
in my loins.

15:36.936 --> 15:37.937
Oh, take it easy, Burt.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.272
No loin talk.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.408
I am walking away

15:41.441 --> 15:43.343
because I'm angry!

15:43.376 --> 15:45.512
J-Jimmy, come on,
don't do this!

15:45.545 --> 15:48.148
What's he...?
Where's he going?

15:48.181 --> 15:52.285
She can't massage him
if he leaves the fight.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.424
BURT:
Uh-oh.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.958
Ooh, what's he doing there?

15:58.992 --> 16:00.093
BURT (imitating Wyatt):
Hey, Sabrina.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.328
Thanks for
the hot dogs.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.362
You're looking
awful vulnerable

16:02.395 --> 16:03.596
and sexy tonight.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.664
You want a hug?

16:04.697 --> 16:05.865
Burt, cut it out.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.800
Do you think we went too far?

16:07.834 --> 16:09.202
You're asking me?

16:09.236 --> 16:10.470
I'm the "too far" guy.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.640
You're supposed
to reel me in!

16:13.673 --> 16:15.508
Oh, dear Lord.
All right.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.144
Now, stay calm, Virginia--
not every massage

16:17.177 --> 16:18.511
has to lead to...

16:18.545 --> 16:19.979
BOTH:
No!

16:23.816 --> 16:25.352
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wyatt, she's a married woman!

16:25.385 --> 16:26.386
Burt, Virginia,

16:26.419 --> 16:28.155
this is not what
it looks like.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.190
Unless it looks like I was
trying for tongue 'cause I was.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.691
What about tongue?

16:31.724 --> 16:33.193
Sabrina, were you
trying to kiss Wyatt?

16:33.226 --> 16:36.296
Jimmy, no, it's
all our fault.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.697
Your father and I
were worried

16:37.730 --> 16:39.132
that your marriage
was losing its spark.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.333
And that's why we brought
Wyatt here.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.501
To get you two fighting.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.669
Aha!

16:42.702 --> 16:44.471
We were right.
Yeah, you called it.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.673
We knew you guys
were setting us up.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.141
I didn't know
what you were up to,

16:48.175 --> 16:51.144
but I knew something was weird.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.980
But then I saw something
that made it

16:54.013 --> 16:55.815
a little bit clearer for me.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.484
After that,
it was just a matter

16:57.517 --> 16:59.052
of getting Jimmy on board.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.187
Your parents are
messing with us.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.754
There was no pickpocket.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.224
Your 50-cent piece
is in the barbecue.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.658
I knew it would turn up.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.260
There's nothing luckier
than a Kennedy.

17:07.294 --> 17:10.163
Jimmy, your parents
stole your wallet.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.065
I'm so confused...

17:12.099 --> 17:13.333
but I trust you.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.502
When I take my hands
off of your face,

17:15.535 --> 17:18.271
I want you to act like
you're so, so mad at me

17:18.305 --> 17:20.340
and storm off and
walk away, okay?

17:20.373 --> 17:22.175
And then I'm gonna find
out what's going on.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.010
Okay, I'm going to throw my arms
up like I'm really, really mad.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.945
They'll totally buy that.
Why would you do that?

17:25.978 --> 17:28.081
Trust me, I can sell it!

17:28.115 --> 17:31.118
I am walking away
because I'm angry!

17:31.151 --> 17:32.552
Jimmy, stop!

17:32.585 --> 17:34.020
Why are you doing this?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.622
The coin didn't burn?

17:35.655 --> 17:37.724
They should make the
space shuttle out of coins.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.092
When did you tell Wyatt

17:39.126 --> 17:40.527
that he should try to
make a move on you?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.794
Oh, I didn't do that.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.363
If you leave Wyatt
alone with a girl

17:43.396 --> 17:44.697
for 20 seconds, he's
gonna make a move on her.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.533
Wyatt, can you come inside
and help with something?

17:46.566 --> 17:47.800
It'll take about 20 seconds.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.069
Anyway, so you and Jimmy
are fine?

17:50.103 --> 17:52.372
I'm sorry, Wyatt.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.541
I am still in love
with my husband.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.376
And your offer
for me to live here?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.545
Sorry, Wyatt, we don't
really need a roommate.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.213
Your life, home
and boat insurance?

18:00.247 --> 18:01.881
I know we-we look
like boat people,

18:01.914 --> 18:03.716
but we could never own a boat.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.252
Or a home.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.253
Or insurance.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.387
So you just used me?

18:07.420 --> 18:08.455
And fed you.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.656
And let you use the lavatory.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.224
And we gave you
a 20-minute window

18:11.258 --> 18:13.092
to try and get Sabrina back.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.162
Swing and a miss, buddy.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.896
You're all horrible people.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.966
And I really wish horrible,
horrible things happen to you.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.903
Oh, and because they might,
I can still offer

18:23.936 --> 18:25.772
my competitive rates.
Oh.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.475
I would definitely get
fire insurance if I were you.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.977
Because I'm considering
burning down your house.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.479
Oh.
Thanks.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.281
We'll be in touch.

18:36.816 --> 18:40.820
So, what made you guys think
we were losing our spark?

18:40.853 --> 18:43.790
Because Jimmy told me that
you two weren't having...

18:44.557 --> 18:45.858
(whispers):
S-E-X.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.828
And I noticed
you weren't shaving your legs.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.763
They looked like something
PETA would protest.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.764
SABRINA:
Okay, I'm sorry.

18:51.798 --> 18:52.965
First of all,

18:52.999 --> 18:54.501
I'm growing it out
to get it waxed.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.702
And second of all,
are you talking

18:55.735 --> 18:57.370
to your dad about
our sex life?

18:57.404 --> 18:59.972
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup,
bup, bup, bup... Hey.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.974
Pennies!

19:03.910 --> 19:07.113
If she keeps falling for that,
you should have her looked at.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.216
No, I didn't tell him
about our sex life.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.518
You said, "There is
nothing to talk about."

19:11.551 --> 19:14.354
Because I didn't want to talk
to my dad about my sex life.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.655
Why not?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.357
We always talk to you
about our sex life.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.691
I know. And it's weird.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.827
I keep asking you
over and over to stop,

19:20.860 --> 19:22.829
but you just keep going.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.664
MAW MAW:
How come nobody asks me

19:24.697 --> 19:26.966
about my sex life?

19:26.999 --> 19:29.836
Any one of you prudes ever sleep
with an Academy Award winner?

19:29.869 --> 19:32.572
Anyway, we thought your marriage
was in trouble, okay?

19:32.605 --> 19:34.341
So we tried
to give you something

19:34.374 --> 19:36.075
that always worked
for us in the past.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.010
A little chaos
to shake things up.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.479
It's very sweet.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.913
Kind of.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.715
You blew a hole
in our wall that is

19:42.749 --> 19:44.251
going to take weeks to fix.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.553
Because we love you.
SABRINA:
It's great that you

19:46.586 --> 19:48.221
were worried about us,
but it's just that

19:48.255 --> 19:49.656
we do things differently.
Yeah, oddly enough,

19:49.689 --> 19:51.824
disasters don't turn us on.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.827
Then may I suggest
a bottle of tequila

19:54.861 --> 19:57.530
and an electric toothbrush.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.866
Okay, I'm done.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.434
JIMMY:
While my parents made the most

20:01.468 --> 20:03.370
out of channeling the stress
in their lives,

20:03.403 --> 20:05.872
Sabrina and I responded to a
different kind of stimulation.

20:05.905 --> 20:06.939
Sabrina!

20:06.973 --> 20:08.241
It's all done.
Wow!

20:08.275 --> 20:10.076
It looks great.

20:10.109 --> 20:13.413
And that is the second
to last thing on our to-do list.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.914
Really? What's left?

20:14.947 --> 20:16.283
Oh, just the door.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.417
What do I have to do?
Sand it? Paint it?

20:17.450 --> 20:19.018
Lock it.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.720
Oh...

20:21.821 --> 20:23.390
(grunts, yells)

20:26.726 --> 20:29.195
Maw Maw put herself to bed.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.932
Jimmy and Sabrina are
back home and doing great.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.801
Hope's just a "P"
and an "E" away

20:34.834 --> 20:37.304
from being able to
spell her own name.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.805
Things have never
been better.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.206
I know.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.309
The bills are paid,
the cars are working.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.976
That flesh-eating virus
I thought I had?

20:44.010 --> 20:45.545
Turned out
to be spaghetti sauce.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.714
(sighs)

20:47.747 --> 20:49.916
I can't think of a damn thing
to worry about.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.951
What if the giant branch

20:51.984 --> 20:54.153
that hangs
over the power line snaps

20:54.186 --> 20:56.423
and causes some kind
of electrical fire?

20:56.456 --> 20:57.924
Dang it. I trimmed that.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.091
(sighs)

20:59.125 --> 21:00.760
What about Oprah's
cable network?

21:00.793 --> 21:02.795
If that goes under,
she could lose one of her homes.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.298
No, it finally started
turning a profit.

21:05.332 --> 21:08.234
And her movie career is smoking.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.769
We really have nothing
to worry about.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.170
That kind of makes me worried.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.339
Me, too.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.407
What if it stays good?

21:14.441 --> 21:16.643
What if all the
excitement is gone?

21:16.676 --> 21:20.079
What if nothing bad ever
happens to us ever again?

21:20.112 --> 21:21.814
It will.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.451
Trust me, honey.
Just relax.

21:24.484 --> 21:27.687
I'm sure chaos is
right around the corner.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.623
That feels good--
really good.
