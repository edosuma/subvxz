00:04.897 --> 00:07.891
I am scared Dundee might be really
full-on for you.

00:07.892 --> 00:10.731
That's my mum and dad. They used
to meet up at Izzy's to have sex.

00:10.732 --> 00:13.771
Marie went missing at a festival.
Three months later, she was dug up.

00:13.772 --> 00:15.491
What if my mum was murdered
on that bed?

00:15.492 --> 00:18.371
Well, let's get that headboard, then,
and let's be primed to reopen the case.

00:18.372 --> 00:20.531
You know that fire scene Prof Gordon
was working on?

00:20.532 --> 00:21.851
Was it called Secrets?

00:21.852 --> 00:23.571
I was the foreman,
and people have died.

00:23.572 --> 00:26.251
What's the worst-case scenario?
Well, it's culpable homicide, so...

00:26.252 --> 00:27.412
Jail.

00:27.492 --> 00:29.691
Your dad's looking out for himself,
no-one else.

00:29.692 --> 00:31.491
Professor Gordon wrote
the fire report.

00:31.492 --> 00:32.811
Have you seen it?

00:32.812 --> 00:35.251
The semen on the headboard
belongs to five different men.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.571
I'll explore Scotland
and I will come back.

00:37.572 --> 00:40.211
Hello, Emma, lovely to meet you.
I'm so sorry about your mother.

00:40.212 --> 00:41.531
I don't want to talk about it.

00:41.532 --> 00:43.691
I need to explain myself
and set you straight.

00:43.692 --> 00:45.411
No! No, get away from me!

00:45.412 --> 00:47.652
Emma!

00:47.732 --> 00:53.132
♪ Baby, you understand me now?

00:53.212 --> 00:58.652
♪ Sometimes you see that I'm mad

01:00.012 --> 01:06.812
♪ Don't you know that no-one alive
can always be an angel?

01:06.892 --> 01:12.532
♪ When everything goes wrong
You feel so bad

01:12.612 --> 01:19.092
♪ Oh, I'm just a soul
whose intentions are good

01:19.172 --> 01:26.972
♪ Oh, lord, please don't let me
be misunderstood. ♪

01:33.940 --> 01:38.100
Emma, just hold on!

01:38.180 --> 01:40.860
Hold on!

01:56.980 --> 01:59.020
Argh! Help!

02:02.660 --> 02:04.780
You're OK. No!

02:04.860 --> 02:07.694
You're OK,
you're going to be fine.

02:09.340 --> 02:11.659
Hang on a sec
while I just take your weight.

02:11.660 --> 02:15.500
Hang on just a sec.
OK, I've... I've got you.

02:15.580 --> 02:18.979
Are you OK to let go?
I need you to let go.

02:18.980 --> 02:20.179
Was she trying to jump?!

02:20.180 --> 02:22.300
She just flipped.

02:22.380 --> 02:23.539
What do you mean "flipped"?

02:23.540 --> 02:26.540
After three. One, two, three.

02:26.620 --> 02:27.980
Argh!

02:28.060 --> 02:30.140
OK, OK.

02:30.220 --> 02:32.304
- OK. OK.
- Let me in!

02:33.460 --> 02:35.019
I live upstairs, I think...

02:35.020 --> 02:37.460
Daniel! Emma!

02:37.540 --> 02:38.580
You OK?

02:38.660 --> 02:41.940
Yeah. What happened? Hey?

02:42.020 --> 02:43.380
Emma.

02:43.460 --> 02:44.979
No! Get him away from me!

02:44.980 --> 02:47.259
I'm so sorry. There's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

02:47.260 --> 02:49.139
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What happened?

02:49.140 --> 02:51.019
Is it OK if I come in? No!

02:51.020 --> 02:53.259
What's going on here?
Nothing. We just need to talk.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.740
No!

02:55.820 --> 02:58.219
Emma, will you come up, and the
three of us can try to sort this out?

02:58.220 --> 02:59.939
No, I don't want to be
anywhere near him.

02:59.940 --> 03:01.459
Let's just go talk about it.

03:01.460 --> 03:03.219
Do you feel safe with these guys?

03:03.220 --> 03:04.220
No!

03:08.500 --> 03:11.059
We should follow them
to the police station.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.379
Yeah. As soon as they get there
and give an account,

03:13.380 --> 03:15.539
we'll be getting a call anyway.

03:15.540 --> 03:19.419
Best to go in, clear this up,
make sure she's OK.

03:19.420 --> 03:20.940
Why were you here?

03:21.020 --> 03:22.739
I was bringing you some wine.

03:22.740 --> 03:24.499
I just don't understand
what happened.

03:24.500 --> 03:25.819
Me neither. She just freaked.

03:25.820 --> 03:28.660
But why? What did you do?

03:28.740 --> 03:32.824
I just said I was sorry
she lost her mum that way.

03:36.580 --> 03:40.419
I went over the balcony because
I thought he wanted to harm me.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.459
It gave her a hell of a fright
when I walked in,

03:42.460 --> 03:44.877
cos she was expecting Daniel.

03:45.140 --> 03:48.139
Basically, from that moment,
she was on edge.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.980
Erm...

03:51.060 --> 03:53.179
He was quizzing me
about how I met Daniel.

03:53.180 --> 03:56.500
A week. I've known her for a week.

03:56.580 --> 03:58.819
He was asking about my mum, but...

03:58.820 --> 04:00.260
He was fishing.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.379
Everything I did
seemed to alarm her.

04:02.380 --> 04:04.499
His behaviour was threatening.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.299
And I felt very threatened by him.

04:06.300 --> 04:09.059
No, I've never known my dad
to threaten someone.

04:09.060 --> 04:12.259
You don't climb over a balcony
if you don't feel threatened.

04:12.260 --> 04:13.760
Emma wouldn't lie.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.219
I just wanted to calm her down.

04:15.220 --> 04:18.970
My dad's adamant
there was a misunderstanding.

04:22.660 --> 04:24.500
Hi, Emma, OK?

04:24.580 --> 04:26.820
Yeah. What's happening?

04:26.900 --> 04:29.180
We've charged Phil MacAfee.

04:29.260 --> 04:31.699
With what? We've charged him
with a Section 38,

04:31.700 --> 04:34.499
which is basically
breach of the peace.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.099
What will happen to him?

04:36.100 --> 04:39.059
He'll be released later tonight,
once we've processed him.

04:39.060 --> 04:40.819
I didn't want him charged.

04:40.820 --> 04:42.819
Well, he has been charged.

04:42.820 --> 04:46.737
We take the state of fear
you were in seriously.

04:46.980 --> 04:50.299
We've told Phil MacAfee
to stay away from you.

04:50.300 --> 04:51.740
Where's Phil now?

04:51.820 --> 04:54.980
Being fingerprinted.

04:55.060 --> 04:57.860
Right, well, you can go home now.

04:57.940 --> 05:01.940
Would you feel safe going home
with Daniel? Yeah.

05:03.220 --> 05:08.387
You will tell DI McKinven that
I've not got a phone, won't you?

05:24.220 --> 05:26.219
Look, I didn't know
they'd charge him.

05:26.220 --> 05:28.419
What did you think was going
to happen when you went off

05:28.420 --> 05:30.499
to the police station to say
you didn't feel safe?

05:30.500 --> 05:34.379
I didn't. What, you didn't think?
Or you didn't feel safe?

05:34.380 --> 05:37.219
Neither. Why the hell
did you go over the balcony?

05:37.220 --> 05:38.700
I just...

05:38.780 --> 05:42.219
I had to get away from your dad,
and I lost it.

05:42.220 --> 05:45.299
Was it because he mentioned
how your mum died?

05:45.300 --> 05:46.300
Yeah.

05:48.220 --> 05:50.539
My dad's got enough going on, Emma.

05:50.540 --> 05:52.619
He's looking at culpable homicide,
thanks to me,

05:52.620 --> 05:56.704
and he needs this like
a hole in the head. I know!

06:07.700 --> 06:10.259
The trainee pathologist
who worked on Marie Monroe

06:10.260 --> 06:11.939
didn't know what she was doing.

06:11.940 --> 06:14.099
Her report is full of
basic ignorance.

06:14.100 --> 06:17.019
She talks about femurs -
the plural is femora.

06:17.020 --> 06:21.179
And she talks about "bones of
the hand" - they have names.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.699
So what would you do differently?

06:22.700 --> 06:24.659
Are we talking about
the contaminated dump site

06:24.660 --> 06:26.579
or are we talking about
Marie Monroe's grave?

06:26.580 --> 06:28.259
You know I'm a
forensic archaeologist

06:28.260 --> 06:32.179
as well as a forensic anthropologist,
right? I do. I was talking about both.

06:32.180 --> 06:36.540
OK. The dump site -
I would dig wider, dig deeper.

06:36.620 --> 06:39.740
They didn't identify a spoil heap.

06:39.820 --> 06:42.980
A person digs a hole.
They stand here.

06:43.060 --> 06:44.579
They dig all the earth out.

06:44.580 --> 06:45.819
They bury the body.

06:45.820 --> 06:47.299
They put all the earth back,

06:47.300 --> 06:49.699
only not all of it will go back
because of the body.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.899
The spoil heap
is higher than the ground.

06:51.900 --> 06:55.299
It might have evidence in it.
You might get a footprint.

06:55.300 --> 06:57.380
Now? It's possible.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.299
It's down there, compacted.
It's going nowhere.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.739
I don't think they even dug down
to the bottom of the dump site.

07:02.740 --> 07:05.779
So, yes, I would dig deeper
and wider, layer by layer.

07:05.780 --> 07:08.259
Are these missing bones
still down there?

07:08.260 --> 07:10.099
And what about clothing?

07:10.100 --> 07:13.179
They assume her clothes were
natural fibres and disintegrated.

07:13.180 --> 07:14.899
Shoes wouldn't disintegrate.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.619
The metal hooks from a bra wouldn't.

07:16.620 --> 07:17.899
Maybe she was naked.

07:17.900 --> 07:22.179
What was she wearing when
she was last seen? A pink dress.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.779
It could still be somewhere.

07:23.780 --> 07:27.939
What about the remains they
eventually buried at her funeral?

07:27.940 --> 07:29.819
I'd want to exhume them.

07:29.820 --> 07:33.320
I'd want a really good look
at those bones.

07:36.140 --> 07:38.307
You don't have to do that.

07:39.820 --> 07:42.154
Didn't know what else to do.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.700
Everything's weird.

07:45.780 --> 07:47.060
I feel stupid.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.250
I should've gone back to my room.

07:53.420 --> 07:55.254
Well, you're here now.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.940
It's my dad.

08:06.100 --> 08:08.180
You OK? Aye.

08:08.260 --> 08:10.659
The cop said what tipped it
was your neighbour saying

08:10.660 --> 08:12.577
how terrified Emma was.

08:12.620 --> 08:14.219
What's going to happen?

08:14.220 --> 08:16.459
They don't expect a prosecution.

08:16.460 --> 08:19.660
Thank God.
It's a very minor charge.

08:19.740 --> 08:20.780
Good.

08:20.860 --> 08:23.259
Cops reckon it'll all
come to nothing.

08:23.260 --> 08:24.660
That's great.

08:24.740 --> 08:25.740
How's Emma?

08:28.380 --> 08:29.460
Mortified.

08:34.140 --> 08:36.140
I lost the plot tonight.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.750
You know what I'm learning?

08:41.860 --> 08:42.860
What?

08:44.100 --> 08:46.684
Strange things happen with you.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.340
Do you mind?

08:49.420 --> 08:51.100
I mind about you.

09:00.860 --> 09:03.277
Do you think you could sleep?

09:04.780 --> 09:06.060
I don't know.

09:07.860 --> 09:09.060
We should try.

09:20.620 --> 09:23.979
I don't know how things
went so wrong between you.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.230
My dad's a great guy, Emma.

09:28.140 --> 09:29.980
Night.

09:30.060 --> 09:31.060
Night.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.810
Hello, Emma.

09:42.820 --> 09:44.860
Hello, Emma.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.500
Lovely to meet you.

09:52.380 --> 09:53.940
Hello, Phil.

10:13.500 --> 10:17.246
When they dug up
Marie Monroe's remains in 2001,

10:17.247 --> 10:19.206
they recorded a sycamore tree.

10:19.207 --> 10:21.087
This one.

10:21.167 --> 10:24.006
Eh, that could have come down
in a storm.

10:24.007 --> 10:26.447
Could've suffered disease.

10:26.527 --> 10:28.247
Right.

10:28.327 --> 10:32.286
And if these shrubs
have turned into those trees...

10:32.287 --> 10:34.167
The grouping works.

10:34.247 --> 10:37.831
I think the sycamore tree
used to be here...

10:38.327 --> 10:41.646
...and that puts the original
dump site roughly here.

10:41.647 --> 10:44.897
Well, it works with
the GPS coordinates.

10:44.927 --> 10:49.177
OK, we'll test the soil
and pinpoint the exact spot.

10:51.447 --> 10:53.207
Pia, where are you?

10:55.327 --> 10:59.406
Well, can you not go up Ben Nevis
and come back here?

10:59.407 --> 11:01.157
Because I need you...

11:02.127 --> 11:04.127
...professionally and...

11:04.567 --> 11:05.651
...otherwise.

11:32.527 --> 11:34.207
Hello there.

11:34.287 --> 11:35.887
Hello, Mrs Muir.

11:35.967 --> 11:38.727
What happened to you?
Long story.

11:38.807 --> 11:40.366
Do you need Professor Gordon?

11:40.367 --> 11:44.526
No, I need Detective Inspector
McKinven, but I dropped my phone.

11:44.527 --> 11:46.206
I don't know how to get hold of him.

11:46.207 --> 11:48.646
I met him here last time.
I was hoping maybe that I could...

11:48.647 --> 11:51.814
Let's open up shop
and give him a ring.

11:55.127 --> 11:57.711
I'm going to tell you a secret.

12:01.607 --> 12:03.367
I hate cake.

12:03.447 --> 12:05.614
I can eat a wheel of Brie,

12:05.687 --> 12:07.247
but I hate cake.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.046
I refused to have anything to do
with the baking rota to start with,

12:10.047 --> 12:11.926
and then I thought...

12:11.927 --> 12:13.966
..."You're going to lose
your job here, Janine."

12:13.967 --> 12:16.566
So now I make ghastly scones
once a quarter.

12:16.567 --> 12:18.087
Do you want one?

12:18.167 --> 12:19.407
No, thank you.

12:19.487 --> 12:21.047
You're no fool.

12:21.127 --> 12:24.406
So, how are you getting
on with the MOOC?

12:24.407 --> 12:25.567
Good...

12:26.767 --> 12:28.807
...after a weird start.

12:28.887 --> 12:32.527
Yeah, I gathered as much.

12:32.607 --> 12:35.357
You know I thought it was my mum?

12:35.767 --> 12:37.487
Yeah.

12:37.567 --> 12:38.567
How?

12:40.407 --> 12:42.406
Well, I sit here all day

12:42.407 --> 12:46.166
and I catch things in my tentacles
without even trying.

12:46.167 --> 12:51.406
It takes great strength of character
to survive that kind of loss.

12:51.407 --> 12:53.407
Sometimes I feel strong.

12:54.287 --> 12:58.537
Other times I just think,
"Why haven't I got a mum?"

12:59.247 --> 13:01.647
Indeed.

13:01.727 --> 13:03.607
Morning.

13:06.087 --> 13:08.367
Come on. Thanks.

13:08.447 --> 13:09.926
The first time I met Phil,

13:09.927 --> 13:13.606
he looked at my face
and he had this look like... Shock.

13:13.607 --> 13:15.006
Like he recognised me.

13:15.007 --> 13:16.886
And I didn't understand it,
but now I get it.

13:16.887 --> 13:20.286
He didn't recognise me,
he recognised my mum.

13:20.287 --> 13:22.047
And he covered it.

13:22.127 --> 13:24.087
He knew my mum!

13:24.167 --> 13:26.966
Maybe he recognised your mum from
photos in the papers at the time.

13:26.967 --> 13:28.566
No! It's familiar recognition.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.926
I'm learning about it in the MOOC,
and I'm convinced of it.

13:30.927 --> 13:32.766
And it explains
what Phil was up to last night,

13:32.767 --> 13:33.926
when he came round to Daniel's.

13:33.927 --> 13:38.006
Yeah, look, I read their statements
from last night, and it's... perplexing.

13:38.007 --> 13:42.206
So, when you said to me,
"What Phil was up to last night..."

13:42.207 --> 13:43.707
He was testing me.

13:43.767 --> 13:46.286
He wanted to know
how I came to meet Daniel.

13:46.287 --> 13:48.126
Well, I want to know that, too.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.567
We bumped into each other.

13:50.647 --> 13:52.047
Right.

13:52.127 --> 13:53.846
This is what Phil was like.

13:53.847 --> 13:55.566
He didn't believe
that it was random.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.206
He thought I'd engineered it.

13:57.207 --> 14:00.766
Me and Daniel just met, got chatting
and he gave me his number.

14:00.767 --> 14:02.687
Right.

14:02.767 --> 14:04.927
Why are you sceptical?

14:05.007 --> 14:06.674
You work with Sarah.

14:06.687 --> 14:08.606
Sarah was part of the investigation
into a fire

14:08.607 --> 14:10.246
the MacAfees are implicated in.

14:10.247 --> 14:12.086
I didn't know that
when I met Daniel.

14:12.087 --> 14:13.727
Maybe Daniel did.

14:13.807 --> 14:14.807
No.

14:16.367 --> 14:20.166
What I want to talk about is my mum
and Phil MacAfee and...

14:20.167 --> 14:23.566
Look, people want you to feel
how they're feeling,

14:23.567 --> 14:25.846
to be in the same state as them.

14:25.847 --> 14:27.366
The classic one's the bully.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.166
The bully feels small,
so he makes someone else feel small.

14:30.167 --> 14:34.526
I felt threatened by Phil last night
because... I threaten him.

14:34.527 --> 14:37.926
Something about me, or something
he thinks I know about him,

14:37.927 --> 14:40.766
threatens him. That's what happened.

14:40.767 --> 14:43.601
I strongly believe he knew my mum.

14:45.367 --> 14:47.807
I need proof.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.766
I'll do my best to establish
if there is any.

14:50.767 --> 14:53.366
Don't share your hunch with anyone.

14:53.367 --> 14:55.286
And don't go asking questions.

14:55.287 --> 14:56.727
OK.

14:56.807 --> 14:58.327
I mean it.

14:58.407 --> 15:01.126
It could put the investigation
at risk.

15:01.127 --> 15:03.447
It could put you at risk.

15:06.207 --> 15:09.327
Whoever killed your mum
is out there.

15:09.407 --> 15:11.686
Where are you staying? Daniel's.

15:11.687 --> 15:14.727
No, I'd advise you not to.

15:15.847 --> 15:19.206
Would you consider leaving Dundee
for a while?

15:19.207 --> 15:21.247
No. OK.

15:21.327 --> 15:23.487
Well, call me, any time.

15:23.567 --> 15:25.886
And if you don't want to talk to me,
talk to Sarah.

15:25.887 --> 15:27.286
She's a good woman.

15:27.287 --> 15:29.326
That's what she said about you.

15:29.327 --> 15:32.127
"Talk to Neil. He's a good man."

15:32.207 --> 15:33.967
Well...

15:35.527 --> 15:38.567
If you need me, I'm here.

15:48.607 --> 15:52.366
Emma's going out with the guy
that refurbished Secrets.

15:52.367 --> 15:54.926
You're kidding!
That's not even the half of it!

15:54.927 --> 15:56.726
Listen, Sarah,
I need to make a phone call.

15:56.727 --> 15:58.846
I need to make it now.
Can we talk later?

15:58.847 --> 16:02.766
Maybe we should meet up.
Good idea. I'll text you.

16:02.767 --> 16:04.527
Trina.

16:04.607 --> 16:06.406
I need you to drop
what you're doing.

16:06.407 --> 16:07.847
Do me a favour.

16:07.927 --> 16:10.726
Uniform took some DNA last night.
Go get it.

16:10.727 --> 16:12.527
MacAfee, Phil.

16:12.607 --> 16:14.246
Why didn't you tell me?

16:14.247 --> 16:17.166
I didn't know Daniel had anything to
do with the fire you were working on

16:17.167 --> 16:19.766
until the day you went
to talk to the fiscal.

16:19.767 --> 16:22.606
It was only that day
I found out it was called Secrets.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.526
My work has to stand up in court.

16:24.527 --> 16:26.246
I don't know what you did!

16:26.247 --> 16:27.886
I didn't see your report!

16:27.887 --> 16:31.006
All I did was bike into town
and buy you a toaster.

16:31.007 --> 16:32.206
You watched us burn it.

16:32.207 --> 16:35.566
Yeah, and I didn't know
what the significance was.

16:35.567 --> 16:37.767
Look, I still don't.

16:37.847 --> 16:39.566
I haven't compromised anything.

16:39.567 --> 16:42.006
Please don't tell me what you have
or haven't compromised.

16:42.007 --> 16:44.086
That is not for you to judge.

16:44.087 --> 16:48.086
The minute you made that connection,
you should have let me know.

16:48.087 --> 16:50.726
When did you hook up with
Daniel MacAfee?

16:50.727 --> 16:53.887
A week ago.
AFTER the fire at Secrets?

16:53.967 --> 16:56.527
Very convenient for him.

16:56.607 --> 16:58.407
How did you meet?

16:58.487 --> 17:00.237
We met in the street.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.526
I lost my bag and he helped me
find it.

17:02.527 --> 17:04.727
Really?
Yes!

17:04.807 --> 17:08.087
Don't you dare lose your temper
with me.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.685
I have given you every chance
to talk to me,

17:10.686 --> 17:13.126
I've made a point
of checking in with you,

17:13.127 --> 17:16.685
so it's hard for me to believe that
you didn't withhold for a reason.

17:16.686 --> 17:20.367
Me seeing Daniel
doesn't affect my work here.

17:20.446 --> 17:22.696
I need to think it through.

17:24.807 --> 17:28.205
When you check in with me,
you don't really want to know.

17:28.207 --> 17:30.007
I beg your pardon?

17:30.087 --> 17:33.446
When you ask me how I am,
as soon as I say I'm fine,

17:33.447 --> 17:35.006
you change the subject.

17:35.007 --> 17:37.341
Because you say you're fine!

17:37.887 --> 17:41.166
You work for me. I employ you.
There are parameters.

17:41.167 --> 17:44.246
What you expect should be realistic
and within those parameters.

17:44.247 --> 17:47.831
You asked me to watch you
burn that toaster!

17:48.847 --> 17:52.206
Catch-up meeting?
No. Let's reschedule that.

17:52.207 --> 17:53.966
Can you declutter our area
this morning?

17:53.967 --> 17:55.206
It's bad enough sharing a lab

17:55.207 --> 17:59.624
without our own bit being as messy
as everyone else's.

18:06.327 --> 18:09.686
We can't get our hands on that DNA
because it's custody DNA,

18:09.687 --> 18:12.566
taken because MacAfee was in custody
for a recordable crime.

18:12.567 --> 18:13.767
By the book.

18:13.847 --> 18:16.166
We could try and fast-track it
as a custody sample.

18:16.167 --> 18:17.686
No, I think we can do better.

18:17.687 --> 18:20.206
Go back, and don't let that post go.
Run!

18:20.207 --> 18:23.457
I'll ask the Super
to get us permission.

18:25.127 --> 18:27.527
One new phone. It's charged.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.606
What? I've put three numbers in it -

18:29.607 --> 18:32.886
Professor Gordon,
Detective Inspector McKinven and me.

18:32.887 --> 18:34.167
Thank you.

18:35.487 --> 18:38.571
Why's Professor Gordon angry
with you?

18:39.847 --> 18:42.047
It's complicated.

18:44.567 --> 18:50.207
And then she said, "You asked me
to watch the toaster burn."

18:50.287 --> 18:51.447
Did you?

18:53.927 --> 18:55.287
Yeah.

18:55.367 --> 18:58.201
She's a smartass, but she's right.

18:58.927 --> 19:01.246
She had no way of knowing
what's in your report,

19:01.247 --> 19:04.006
and you pack away evidence
when you leave the lab.

19:04.007 --> 19:05.727
Scrupulously.

19:05.807 --> 19:08.246
So what did you tell her
you plan to do about it?

19:08.247 --> 19:11.527
I didn't. I wanted to talk to you.

19:11.607 --> 19:14.647
And I wanted a bit of status.

19:14.727 --> 19:17.894
God! Emma Hedges -
she's like a magnet!

19:18.807 --> 19:20.557
Stuff happens to her.

19:23.327 --> 19:25.411
You going to share those?

19:46.847 --> 19:49.486
Phil MacAfee's DNA
has gone to the lab.

19:49.487 --> 19:51.687
Vincent Keir's gone AWOL.

19:51.767 --> 19:53.934
We know there was a scene.

19:56.967 --> 19:58.647
Marie, Drew, Izzy...

19:58.727 --> 20:00.087
Izzy's the key.

20:00.167 --> 20:02.886
Sex was in the mix.
Drugs were in the mix.

20:02.887 --> 20:04.806
And there's something - or someone -

20:04.807 --> 20:07.366
that Drew and Izzy
aren't talking about.

20:07.367 --> 20:11.166
Today, we find out that Emma Hedges
is mixed up with the MacAfees.

20:11.167 --> 20:17.087
She suspects Phil MacAfee
knew Marie. So... who knows?

20:17.167 --> 20:20.246
When Jimmy was telling us
about Marie dancing at Tall Ships,

20:20.247 --> 20:23.646
he wanted us to picture a bunch of
lairy guys perving on her.

20:23.647 --> 20:27.886
But all it made me think is what
a seriously jealous guy Jimmy is.

20:27.887 --> 20:29.687
Me too. He's a creep!

20:29.767 --> 20:32.206
He was basically saying,
because of what she was wearing,

20:32.207 --> 20:33.807
she had it coming.

20:33.887 --> 20:39.304
I'll tell you what I want to know -
are the MacAfees playing Emma?

20:42.207 --> 20:45.501
Daniel, what do you think happened
last night

20:45.502 --> 20:47.541
between Emma and your father?

20:47.542 --> 20:48.709
Good question.

20:50.622 --> 20:52.182
I think...

20:52.262 --> 20:53.821
I think it was like
the perfect storm

20:53.822 --> 20:56.572
of a personality clash, you know?

20:56.582 --> 20:59.701
See, my dad can be full-on,
if you're not used to it.

20:59.702 --> 21:02.781
And he expects to win people over,
is the other thing, cos...

21:02.782 --> 21:04.366
Cos he always does.

21:04.382 --> 21:05.941
So you've got that,

21:05.942 --> 21:10.442
and then you've got Emma,
who's sensitive and brainy...

21:11.582 --> 21:13.741
...but there's a vulnerability there.

21:13.742 --> 21:15.661
You haven't known her for long.

21:15.662 --> 21:19.262
No, but I'm very fond of her.

21:19.342 --> 21:22.061
So my dad came in -
that's given her a shock.

21:22.062 --> 21:23.662
She's shrunk back.

21:23.742 --> 21:26.541
He's pushed forward, just...
Pushed forward? As in...?

21:26.542 --> 21:28.381
No, not as in physically.

21:28.382 --> 21:31.701
Just... kept on chatting
and joking, you know,

21:31.702 --> 21:33.952
wanting to bring her round.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.181
To see the situation his way.

21:36.182 --> 21:37.942
Aye.

21:38.022 --> 21:39.622
Aye.

21:39.702 --> 21:41.821
I can see how that would seem
to Emma.

21:41.822 --> 21:44.341
The more he's persisted,
the more she's retreated.

21:44.342 --> 21:48.541
And he's waded in, pushed the
big button, and she's lost it.

21:48.542 --> 21:50.376
What's the big button?

21:51.462 --> 21:53.962
The fact her mum was murdered.

21:54.422 --> 21:56.839
The fact it's still unsolved.

22:01.982 --> 22:04.461
You and your father were charged
with culpable homicide

22:04.462 --> 22:07.061
with regards to the fire
at Secrets nightclub.

22:07.062 --> 22:08.062
Yeah.

22:09.502 --> 22:12.581
When did you discover that
Emma worked for the woman

22:12.582 --> 22:15.332
that wrote the report on Secrets?

22:16.662 --> 22:18.829
Day after we were charged.

22:30.102 --> 22:31.622
How's Emma today?

22:31.702 --> 22:34.422
I think she's OK. Good.

22:34.502 --> 22:35.902
Highly strung.

22:36.942 --> 22:39.022
Would that be fair?

22:39.102 --> 22:40.342
Maybe.

22:40.422 --> 22:43.341
The officer she's been talking to
just came by.

22:43.342 --> 22:44.702
From last night?

22:44.782 --> 22:47.021
No, the guy she's been dealing with
to do with her mum -

22:47.022 --> 22:49.061
you know, stuff that's just came up.

22:49.062 --> 22:51.101
You told your solicitor
you won't plead guilty

22:51.102 --> 22:54.622
to the culpable homicide,
same as me? Yeah.

22:54.702 --> 22:55.702
Great job.

23:00.782 --> 23:02.866
How far do these go back?

23:04.022 --> 23:05.102
Seven years.

23:06.622 --> 23:07.821
What did the police say

23:07.822 --> 23:12.461
when you couldn't produce the
paperwork for the Secrets job?

23:12.462 --> 23:14.181
They just had to accept it.

23:14.182 --> 23:17.381
I explained we junked a lot of stuff
when you moved into the new place.

23:17.382 --> 23:20.062
Good. Why?

23:20.142 --> 23:24.809
I don't want nosy bastards
poking about in our paperwork.

23:30.302 --> 23:32.741
Phil MacAfee's DNA's
on the headboard!

23:32.742 --> 23:33.902
Wow!

23:33.982 --> 23:36.661
The guys from the lab just told me -
his semen's all over it.

23:36.662 --> 23:38.981
We know Marie Monroe had sex
in that bed, too.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.661
It puts MacAfee with Marie!

23:40.662 --> 23:42.221
Not necessarily at the same time.

23:42.222 --> 23:46.501
No. But neither Drew or Izzy
have ever mentioned a Phil MacAfee.

23:46.502 --> 23:47.502
Why?

23:47.542 --> 23:49.626
Who do we speak to first?

23:50.982 --> 23:53.421
Let me tell you
about the birds and the bees.

23:53.422 --> 23:55.421
See, when a man ejaculates,

23:55.422 --> 23:59.822
he shoots a load of his spermatozoa
from his boaby.

23:59.902 --> 24:02.741
And if his pal's not there
to catch it...

24:02.742 --> 24:04.421
...it will paint the furniture.

24:04.422 --> 24:06.672
Tell us about Phil MacAfee.

24:09.182 --> 24:12.621
He was a guy I had a thing with -
ancient history.

24:12.622 --> 24:15.142
I was his bit on the side.

24:15.222 --> 24:16.722
Did he know Marie?

24:18.222 --> 24:20.062
Not really.

24:21.262 --> 24:24.062
You know someone, or you don't.

24:24.142 --> 24:26.421
Well, their paths might have crossed
from time to time.

24:26.422 --> 24:28.222
I don't remember.

24:28.302 --> 24:32.022
Do you know Vincent Keir?

24:32.102 --> 24:35.019
Now, there's a name I hate to hear.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.342
Why?

24:43.742 --> 24:44.902
He was evil.

24:46.662 --> 24:48.822
A drug dealer.

24:48.902 --> 24:52.581
Sell you anything,
find you anywhere, that was him.

24:52.582 --> 24:54.999
I haven't seen him for years.

24:55.062 --> 24:57.702
Did you see him at Tall Ships?

24:57.782 --> 24:58.862
No.

25:00.542 --> 25:03.382
Did you see Phil later that night?

25:05.142 --> 25:06.342
No.

25:07.422 --> 25:09.102
You remember that?

25:09.182 --> 25:14.016
I remember the night I never saw
my best friend after, aye!

25:15.582 --> 25:18.332
I couldn't see Phil that night...

25:19.302 --> 25:21.969
...cos he was visiting his wife.

25:27.902 --> 25:30.941
I-I'm really sorry
that I was rude to you.

25:30.942 --> 25:33.581
I completely get why
you're angry at me.

25:33.582 --> 25:35.941
I won't misjudge things
like that again.

25:35.942 --> 25:37.776
If you do, you're out.

25:39.102 --> 25:41.936
That's the last thing that I want.

25:42.622 --> 25:45.622
You need to respect what we do here.

25:48.262 --> 25:50.982
OK, back to the work.

25:51.062 --> 25:53.302
Thank you.

25:53.382 --> 25:56.221
Louise, the police are going to be
dropping off a very small sample

25:56.222 --> 25:59.421
of drugs from a recent seizure,
which they'd like us to analyse.

25:59.422 --> 26:02.221
Is it the drugs that killed
those girls?

26:02.222 --> 26:04.556
I can't discuss a live case.

26:17.222 --> 26:19.421
Is this about the other night?

26:19.422 --> 26:21.661
What other night, Mrs MacAfee?

26:21.662 --> 26:23.662
The balcony incident?

26:23.742 --> 26:25.461
You're aware of that?

26:25.462 --> 26:28.462
Daniel gave me his account of it.

26:28.542 --> 26:34.102
I filled in the blanks -
mentally, not to Daniel.

26:34.182 --> 26:36.432
You'll have to help me out.

26:37.822 --> 26:40.462
He'll have made a move on her.

26:40.542 --> 26:41.542
Who?

26:41.622 --> 26:46.142
Phil will have made a move
on that girl, Emma.

26:46.222 --> 26:48.221
What makes you say that?

26:48.222 --> 26:50.662
Being his wife for 16 years.

26:52.182 --> 26:53.941
Not a good experience?

26:53.942 --> 26:56.182
Not for me.

26:56.262 --> 26:58.102
Why was that?

26:58.182 --> 26:59.766
When I loved him...

27:01.542 --> 27:04.126
...I thought he was persuasive.

27:05.182 --> 27:08.766
When I didn't,
I thought he was a bulldozer.

27:09.382 --> 27:11.141
What sort of a bulldozer?

27:11.142 --> 27:13.342
A bedroom one.

27:13.422 --> 27:14.839
And he was rough.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.822
Should've left him sooner.

27:20.302 --> 27:24.581
We're here to ask you about a
particular day in 2001, Mrs MacAfee.

27:24.582 --> 27:26.832
Sunday, the 12th of August.

27:27.462 --> 27:31.296
I was recovering from a mastectomy
in hospital.

27:33.102 --> 27:36.022
I'd just turned 35.

27:36.102 --> 27:38.519
I can see why you'd remember.

27:38.582 --> 27:41.981
Do you remember if Phil visited you
that day?

27:41.982 --> 27:42.982
No...

27:45.462 --> 27:47.629
...but I can easily check.

27:48.222 --> 27:50.389
Have you ever nearly died?

27:50.742 --> 27:52.662
No.

27:52.742 --> 27:54.222
I kept a diary.

27:55.422 --> 27:59.862
I had a bedside party for
my birthday on the Saturday.

27:59.942 --> 28:03.542
On Sunday, the 12th, I've written,

28:03.622 --> 28:06.872
"No visitors today.
Party wiped me out."

28:07.422 --> 28:11.182
The letter P shows
when Phil visited.

28:11.262 --> 28:12.942
There's no P.

28:13.022 --> 28:15.822
He wasn't with me.

28:15.902 --> 28:20.102
What does "D to G" stand for?

28:20.182 --> 28:22.142
Daniel to Granny's.

28:22.222 --> 28:25.889
Would you let me hang onto this,
Mrs MacAfee?

28:27.462 --> 28:29.222
Hi. Hey.

28:53.942 --> 28:56.621
Well, I don't think she's
a corporate spy any more, do you?

28:56.622 --> 28:58.542
No!

28:58.622 --> 29:00.181
She refuses to leave Dundee.

29:00.182 --> 29:02.461
I just wish I could get her
away from the MacAfees.

29:02.462 --> 29:03.462
Why?

29:03.542 --> 29:05.341
Something's not right there.

29:05.342 --> 29:06.742
In what way?

29:06.822 --> 29:08.581
Well, I don't quite know yet.

29:08.582 --> 29:11.181
But she's smitten with Daniel,
right enough.

29:11.182 --> 29:13.861
Is she?
I thought, "OK, Emma's young.

29:13.862 --> 29:15.661
"She's fallen for this older guy.

29:15.662 --> 29:17.661
"Maybe he's having a bit of fun
with her."

29:17.662 --> 29:20.901
But when I went to talk to Daniel,
he was exactly the same.

29:20.902 --> 29:21.982
Really?

29:22.062 --> 29:24.501
It's like they met, and kaboom.

29:24.502 --> 29:25.919
It's like a drug.

29:26.622 --> 29:27.622
Exactly!

29:28.702 --> 29:31.786
It's like they've taken
the same drug.

29:38.862 --> 29:43.181
I just think it's interesting that,
a few days ago, you're like,

29:43.182 --> 29:45.461
"I'm going to take responsibility.

29:45.462 --> 29:48.061
"People died in that fire.
I feel terrible for the families."

29:48.062 --> 29:51.141
And then you talk to your dad -
and suddenly you're like,

29:51.142 --> 29:55.261
"The system's wrong. I'm not
going to plead guilty to anything."

29:55.262 --> 29:59.012
You don't mean "interesting",
so don't say it.

30:00.142 --> 30:01.982
OK, what do I mean?

30:02.062 --> 30:03.542
You tell me.

30:03.622 --> 30:05.902
OK. I mean shit.

30:05.982 --> 30:07.461
I mean, I think it's really shit

30:07.462 --> 30:10.941
that your dad talked you out of
doing the right thing. Oh, shut up!

30:10.942 --> 30:12.501
What is the right thing?

30:12.502 --> 30:13.901
Do you want me to go to jail?

30:13.902 --> 30:15.061
Of course not!

30:15.062 --> 30:17.581
Look, don't turn this back on me!
Your dad talked you out of it,

30:17.582 --> 30:19.941
and you let him!
I took his advice, OK?

30:19.942 --> 30:21.781
We discussed it,
and I took his advice.

30:21.782 --> 30:25.141
Well, you shouldn't take advice
from him. Why? Eh?

30:25.142 --> 30:27.301
Why shouldn't I take advice
from him?

30:27.302 --> 30:29.902
Because you're nicer than him.

30:29.982 --> 30:32.261
You know it and
you just won't admit it.

30:32.262 --> 30:34.181
What is your problem with my dad?

30:34.182 --> 30:35.599
What's his crime?

30:38.142 --> 30:40.861
Look, you can't just stand there,
creating an atmosphere

30:40.862 --> 30:43.381
and picking a fight.
You need to come out with it.

30:43.382 --> 30:45.021
I can't have this conversation.

30:45.022 --> 30:49.021
Oh, right. Happy to knock everything
over but not prepared to explain.

30:49.022 --> 30:52.381
You said, "I hope I don't
bring you down."

30:52.382 --> 30:54.501
I'm starting to think
that's what you'd like to do.

30:54.502 --> 30:55.622
It isn't.

30:55.702 --> 30:58.461
I think you like everything a bit
fucked up. I think you need it.

30:58.462 --> 30:59.542
Bullshit!

30:59.622 --> 31:00.941
I don't. I don't need it!

31:00.942 --> 31:03.261
I don't want it. I'm not having it.
And I don't want you!

31:03.262 --> 31:06.096
Well, I don't want you!

31:32.787 --> 31:34.614
I want to get stoned.

31:40.783 --> 31:46.503
My pal Tam and me have got
a sort of allotment up by his place.

31:46.583 --> 31:48.250
That's where I grow.

31:48.303 --> 31:49.583
You grew this?

31:49.663 --> 31:51.823
Mmm. We hate skunk.

31:55.183 --> 32:01.823
We were pining for the simple
pleasure of our youths - grass!

32:04.103 --> 32:05.520
It's really nice.

32:09.943 --> 32:11.622
You can have a baggie any time.

32:11.623 --> 32:13.903
Thank you.

32:18.983 --> 32:22.383
Don't take pills or powders, Emma,

32:22.463 --> 32:25.462
and don't buy anything
off the dark web.

32:25.463 --> 32:28.423
Known provenance - way to go.

32:31.983 --> 32:34.142
What happened to your face?

32:34.143 --> 32:35.783
Shh!

32:38.023 --> 32:42.062
Why do you not have anyone else
to get stoned with tonight?

32:42.063 --> 32:45.023
Shh!

32:45.103 --> 32:47.103
Your mum loved to smoke.

32:47.943 --> 32:50.503
Did she?

32:55.783 --> 32:57.903
Loved her Charlie, too.

32:59.703 --> 33:01.463
Quite the hedonist.

33:04.503 --> 33:06.183
We all were.

33:07.543 --> 33:09.343
Who's "we"?

33:09.423 --> 33:12.063
Me, Izzy, your mum.

33:14.383 --> 33:16.983
How did she keep it from Jimmy?

33:18.743 --> 33:21.077
Just a separate compartment.

33:22.463 --> 33:26.022
Mum must have had other friends
apart from just you and Izzy.

33:26.023 --> 33:28.190
We were the three monkeys.

33:32.263 --> 33:35.180
So why don't you see Izzy any more?

33:37.543 --> 33:42.903
You think a terrible shared
experience will bring people closer.

33:44.863 --> 33:46.463
Does the opposite.

33:50.703 --> 33:54.583
Your reactions are... out of sync.

33:57.743 --> 33:59.743
You remind each other...

34:01.303 --> 34:02.623
...of pain.

34:05.703 --> 34:07.223
Emma...

34:09.783 --> 34:12.449
...I need to tell you something.

34:23.103 --> 34:26.187
Shona and me are going to
have a baby.

34:29.783 --> 34:31.382
What's so funny?

34:32.783 --> 34:34.023
Life.

35:17.983 --> 35:20.222
These are the ones
that I was telling you about -

35:20.223 --> 35:21.703
from a recent seizure.

35:21.704 --> 35:22.784
OK.

35:25.103 --> 35:28.770
Run your tests.
I'll check in with you later.

35:30.903 --> 35:32.503
It's not just me.

35:32.583 --> 35:35.622
You think that these are the pills
that killed those girls, don't you?

35:35.623 --> 35:39.222
Well, I wouldn't want Professor
Gordon to catch me saying so, but...

35:39.223 --> 35:40.623
Yes, I do.

35:41.983 --> 35:44.182
There may be a drugs link
between Marie Monroe

35:44.183 --> 35:46.262
and Vincent Keir,
but he's disappeared.

35:46.263 --> 35:48.662
What's the story with MacAfee?

35:48.663 --> 35:53.982
He doesn't crop up on the original
files, but he's connected, via Izzy.

35:53.983 --> 35:57.942
And he had the means -
an enclosed yard and a van.

35:57.943 --> 36:01.582
And he wasn't where he says he was
on August 12th, 2001.

36:01.583 --> 36:03.542
We could do a positional interview,

36:03.543 --> 36:06.822
but I don't want him to know
we're interested in him,

36:06.823 --> 36:08.742
not before we have
stronger evidence.

36:08.743 --> 36:11.262
That's why we have to go back
to the dump site.

36:11.263 --> 36:13.182
The first dig was amateur.

36:13.183 --> 36:14.942
SOCOs did the digging.

36:14.943 --> 36:17.902
This time, Dr Salvador and I will be
the only ones who do the dig,

36:17.903 --> 36:19.342
because we're qualified.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.982
We know where to start,
because of changes in the soil.

36:21.983 --> 36:25.702
Previously disturbed soil
is looser than undisturbed soil,

36:25.703 --> 36:27.102
which is compacted.

36:27.103 --> 36:29.622
You can see the difference.
You can feel it.

36:29.623 --> 36:31.342
We'll do the whole dig in one day.

36:31.343 --> 36:35.422
We hope to find further evidence -
missing bones, clothing possibly.

36:35.423 --> 36:36.982
Her pink dress was never found.

36:36.983 --> 36:40.182
How do we keep the press at bay?
We do it under cover of a tent.

36:40.183 --> 36:42.942
Folk'll stop at nothing -
they'll be sending drones over.

36:42.943 --> 36:44.982
Controlling the scene is vital.

36:44.983 --> 36:46.183
Kathy's right.

36:46.263 --> 36:48.862
We need to be super competent
this time round.

36:48.863 --> 36:50.862
And we need to be sensitive
to the fact

36:50.863 --> 36:54.502
that we're reopening a wound -
there are living relatives.

36:54.503 --> 36:58.502
There's been a lot of pain.
So let's do this well.

36:58.503 --> 37:00.263
And successfully.

37:00.343 --> 37:02.063
This is costly.

37:02.143 --> 37:04.102
It'll get a lot of attention.

37:04.103 --> 37:06.853
I'd like it to be the right kind.

37:09.423 --> 37:12.222
All the results for these latest
pills conform with the results

37:12.223 --> 37:14.582
of the 18, with the PMMA mixed in.

37:14.583 --> 37:16.822
It's the same impurity profiles,

37:16.823 --> 37:20.422
suggesting the same recipe for MDMA,
a cold production recipe.

37:20.423 --> 37:21.823
Great stuff.

37:21.903 --> 37:24.622
I'll pass that on
to the police investigation.

37:24.623 --> 37:26.662
You think these pills are
being made in Dundee?

37:26.663 --> 37:30.022
I don't know, but the supply seems
to be affecting just Dundee so far.

37:30.023 --> 37:32.862
I reckon they are, and I bet
it's only a small operation

37:32.863 --> 37:34.702
if the pills aren't leaving Dundee.

37:34.703 --> 37:37.102
Do you think we'll meet
the police partners at some point?

37:37.103 --> 37:39.903
That would be really fascinating.

37:39.983 --> 37:43.302
DI McKinven's been given the
go-ahead to reopen the investigation

37:43.303 --> 37:46.503
into your mother's murder -
officially.

37:49.663 --> 37:51.863
Are you OK?

37:51.943 --> 37:54.542
I'm going to be working
with DI McKinven.

37:54.543 --> 37:57.182
We're planning to re-dig
the site on Law Hill,

37:57.183 --> 37:58.622
where her remains were found.

37:58.623 --> 38:00.822
And we're planning to exhume
her grave.

38:00.823 --> 38:03.383
That's great. It is.

38:04.703 --> 38:07.422
But while Kathy's working
on your mum's case,

38:07.423 --> 38:10.182
I'm afraid you can't be employed
by SIFA.

38:10.183 --> 38:11.183
Why?

38:12.983 --> 38:14.822
I don't even work with
Professor Torrance.

38:14.823 --> 38:17.463
Can't I just continue with you?

38:17.543 --> 38:21.183
No, because we're all connected.

38:21.263 --> 38:22.902
Can you imagine it in court?

38:22.903 --> 38:26.062
Some sharky defence lawyer going
to town about conflict of interest

38:26.063 --> 38:29.480
at SIFA and the jury
doubting my evidence?

38:32.143 --> 38:33.382
I love it here.

38:33.383 --> 38:37.383
I know. I know you do,
but Kathy's right.

38:37.463 --> 38:39.183
You know...

38:39.263 --> 38:41.742
...DI McKinven thinks
it might be best for you

38:41.743 --> 38:45.660
to just take yourself
out of Dundee for a while.

39:00.703 --> 39:02.862
Hi, you've reached
Daniel's phone.

39:02.863 --> 39:06.780
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

39:08.703 --> 39:11.223
Emma!

39:13.823 --> 39:16.240
Oh, God! Oh, I've missed you!

39:16.263 --> 39:17.942
What are you doing here?

39:17.943 --> 39:20.182
I've come to take you home.

39:20.183 --> 39:21.582
I'm not coming home.

39:21.583 --> 39:24.222
Yes, you are. DI McKinven phoned me
yesterday and he t-...

39:24.223 --> 39:28.262
You can't just take me home.
I'm not seven years old.

39:28.263 --> 39:30.702
If I want to go home,
I'll take myself home.

39:30.703 --> 39:34.037
But I don't want to,
so I'm not going to.

39:34.623 --> 39:39.183
And it's not up to you,
or DI McKinven, or anyone else.

39:39.263 --> 39:41.513
I'm not ready to come home.

39:43.223 --> 39:45.902
I'm just trying to protect you.
Well, you've got to stop, Julie.

39:45.903 --> 39:47.182
This comes from love.

39:47.183 --> 39:50.100
I know, but it just pushes me away.

39:51.023 --> 39:54.822
Hell of a long way to come
for a slap in the face.

39:54.823 --> 39:57.240
I'm just trying to be honest.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.827
I don't want to hurt you.

40:01.543 --> 40:03.783
But it... It is hurtful.

40:05.743 --> 40:08.493
Shall we go for something to eat?

40:10.423 --> 40:15.503
So, er, DI McKinven tells me
you're in a new relationship.

40:15.583 --> 40:17.383
I didn't realise.

40:17.463 --> 40:19.543
I'm not.

40:19.623 --> 40:22.263
Not any more. It's over.

40:22.343 --> 40:23.823
Oh.

40:23.903 --> 40:27.182
So, here you'll be in Dundee,
on your own.

40:27.183 --> 40:30.022
No boyfriend, and no job now,
you're telling me?

40:30.023 --> 40:32.902
Only while Professor Torrance
is working with DI McKinven.

40:32.903 --> 40:35.982
Aren't you at all tempted to
come back, just for a while?

40:35.983 --> 40:40.023
No. I need to be here with Mum.

40:40.103 --> 40:41.103
OK.

40:42.223 --> 40:45.782
Emma... Do you know if she knew
a guy called Phil MacAfee?

40:45.783 --> 40:48.700
Ah, I don't know. I don't think so.

40:48.703 --> 40:50.502
Sorry, what were you about to say?

40:50.503 --> 40:54.862
I was about to say that I know
you're not seven years old,

40:54.863 --> 40:59.530
and I've never been surer of that
than seeing you here...

40:59.783 --> 41:01.583
...so self-possessed.

41:01.663 --> 41:04.663
And I agree that it is
time for me...

41:05.863 --> 41:10.222
But I am never going to let go of
you, so don't get your hopes up.

41:10.223 --> 41:14.583
But... loosen my hold a bit.

41:14.663 --> 41:17.143
You needed to hold on tight.

41:17.223 --> 41:19.342
I'm so lucky that you did.

41:19.343 --> 41:21.423
Well, I feel lucky, too.

41:21.503 --> 41:23.702
Hey, do you want to squish up
in bed with me tonight?

41:23.703 --> 41:25.943
I won't snore.

41:26.023 --> 41:29.102
Thanks, but I'm going to get
the train home tonight.

41:29.103 --> 41:32.187
You sure?
Yeah. There's one at ten to.

41:33.183 --> 41:37.350
And you're on your feet now.
You know, you're good.

41:43.263 --> 41:45.783
Why are we called Hedges?

41:45.863 --> 41:48.062
I was Hedges when I married, so...

41:48.063 --> 41:51.262
Yeah, but why are we still
called it? I don't know.

41:51.263 --> 41:52.942
I mean... You should be
Julie Monroe,

41:52.943 --> 41:54.622
I should be Emma Monroe.

41:54.623 --> 41:56.957
That's what we were born as.

41:57.423 --> 41:59.023
Shall we do it?

41:59.103 --> 42:00.103
Yeah.

42:13.903 --> 42:16.063
Hello, Izzy.

42:16.143 --> 42:19.103
How are you doing?

42:19.183 --> 42:20.863
OK.

42:20.943 --> 42:21.943
Good.

42:25.383 --> 42:27.223
You look good.

42:27.303 --> 42:28.983
Skye looks good.

42:30.383 --> 42:33.382
I've seen her in her pharmacy
once or twice.

42:33.383 --> 42:36.302
I knew she wouldn't remember me,
so I didn't say hello.

42:36.303 --> 42:38.803
And I've seen Emma, of course.

42:40.143 --> 42:41.423
How?

42:41.503 --> 42:44.170
Cos she's going out with my son.

42:45.023 --> 42:47.303
As you very well know.

42:47.383 --> 42:48.663
You are joking!

42:50.783 --> 42:51.823
No.

42:56.543 --> 42:57.663
Listen...

43:00.343 --> 43:02.142
...you may not know this,

43:02.143 --> 43:05.742
but there's a big old nostalgia trip
under way -

43:05.743 --> 43:07.743
the summer of 2001.

43:08.943 --> 43:12.582
I just wanted to give you
the heads-up, cos, well,

43:12.583 --> 43:14.303
you and me,

43:14.383 --> 43:17.743
we both know it can be very painful

43:17.823 --> 43:19.423
raking up the past.

43:21.543 --> 43:23.103
Am I right?

43:25.863 --> 43:27.383
Aye.
