WEBVTT

00:45.587 --> 00:50.675
SHORTA IS AN
ARABIC WORD FOR POLICE

00:52.969 --> 00:55.472
-Let me go!
-Don't move!

00:57.307 --> 00:59.601
I can't breathe!

01:00.518 --> 01:04.397
Stay down, goddammit!
Lie still, for fuck's sake!

01:05.815 --> 01:07.984
-I can't breathe!
-Stay still!

01:08.151 --> 01:09.903
I can't breathe!

01:57.367 --> 02:00.995
<i>15 people have been detained
after violent riots</i>

02:01.162 --> 02:05.208
<i>following the arrest of
19-year-old Talib Ben Hassi,</i>

02:05.375 --> 02:08.211
<i>who was taken to the ICU…</i>

02:16.928 --> 02:20.306
P14. P14. Flying over Svalegården.
No large gatherings.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.725
Nothing to report.

02:27.063 --> 02:33.820
<i>Deputy Chief of Police Birgit Rabech
says the situation is improving.</i>

02:33.987 --> 02:37.198
<i>We are massively present in the area,</i>

02:37.323 --> 02:39.284
<i>and have the youngsters
under control.</i>

02:39.659 --> 02:42.871
<i>Talib Ben Hassi was arrested
after a dramatic car chase,</i>

02:43.079 --> 02:49.753
<i>and was subsequently transferred to
the hospital in critical condition.</i>

03:00.347 --> 03:02.640
-Okay?
-Yeah, yeah. Fine.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.603
-Hi. What's up?
-What's up?

03:07.270 --> 03:11.733
Poulsen, take it easy.
I'll take care of it.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.411
OUT OF ORDER

03:32.545 --> 03:33.755
Hey…

03:34.339 --> 03:37.384
-Broken again?
-Yes. It says disconnected.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.553
Cheap crap. Feeling better?

03:40.720 --> 03:44.599
-Yeah, guess it was just a bug.
-Marianne has been sick, too.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.144
-Not going out on patrol?
-I was gonna do some paperwork.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.979
I want everybody on wheels.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.984
And… by the way…

03:55.151 --> 03:57.070
I'd like you to ride
with Mike Andersen.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.661
I need someone to keep him on a short
leash. Just until this blows over.

04:04.828 --> 04:08.957
Internal Affairs want to talk to
everyone who was on call that night.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.710
-I'll give them a call.
-Good.

04:12.002 --> 04:15.964
My door is always open
if you need to talk.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.843
-Thanks.
-See you in there.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.261
Yep.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.189
-Good morning.
-Morning.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.525
-Here.
-Ah, thanks.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.655
I see you're riding
with Mike Andersen.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.994
I'd rather blow my brains out.

04:46.161 --> 04:49.539
Why don't they take his badge
like with Kofoed and Poulsen?

04:49.664 --> 04:51.082
They'll be back in a week.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.461
They're two professional witnesses,

04:54.586 --> 04:56.504
and there's no one
to dispute their story.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.591
You were working
that night too, right?

05:01.801 --> 05:04.596
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

05:04.763 --> 05:08.350
Thank you to those of you
who came in on your day off.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.644
As you know,
we've had a bit of trouble

05:11.770 --> 05:14.481
with the Talib Ben Hassi situation.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.692
Ben Hassi's condition is stable,
but if that changes,

05:17.859 --> 05:23.114
we expect the riots to escalate,
so that is our primary focus.

05:23.406 --> 05:27.160
Ben Hassi is from Svalegården,
so stay clear of the area.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.662
Unless you have a specific task.

05:29.829 --> 05:34.334
Our presence could escalate
the conflict. Any questions?

05:34.834 --> 05:37.796
-Møller?
-Where are Kofoed and Poulsen?

05:38.463 --> 05:41.800
On forced leave until it's been
determined whether to press charges.

05:41.966 --> 05:45.095
It's normal procedure,
but I'm expecting an acquittal.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.640
-And our lieu days?
-You're getting overtime pay.

05:48.807 --> 05:52.102
Our kids'll forget what we look like.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.270
In your case, that's good, Møller.

05:54.604 --> 05:58.066
-I have something for you.
-It's a bit crooked, isn't it?

05:58.233 --> 05:59.984
Shut it!

06:00.151 --> 06:02.779
I know it's tough
out there right now,

06:02.904 --> 06:05.699
but I'm doing my best to change that.

06:06.324 --> 06:10.787
Remember, we're the people's
only safeguard against total chaos,

06:10.954 --> 06:14.708
so get out there and restore order
before anyone questions that.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.585
<i>You</i> set the agenda.

06:17.752 --> 06:21.673
Have a good shift. And watch
each other's backs out there.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.137
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

06:27.303 --> 06:29.639
It's gonna be a long day.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.100
Eight hours with Supercop over there.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.063
-I'm more worried about his music.
-Cop rock?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.899
Rock out with your glock out.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.527
Beers are on me after work,
if you need to talk.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.574
If I make it that long.
Have a good one, Rønning.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.242
-Have fun.
-Thanks.

06:53.955 --> 06:57.334
-There he is. Ready to roll?
-Yep.

06:57.709 --> 06:58.877
Good.

07:37.207 --> 07:41.920
POLICE

07:51.304 --> 07:53.264
"VICTIM OF POLICE BRUTALITY?
TALIB ON LIFE SUPPORT"

07:53.390 --> 07:58.019
"Women with big butts
have smarter children." Aha.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.689
Good thing I had kids with my ex.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.027
-Got any kids?
-Not yet.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.947
-Married?
-Yes.

08:09.114 --> 08:13.410
-But no ring?
-Not on the job, no.

08:13.576 --> 08:17.414
Remember when Laursen's ring
got caught on a fence?

08:17.580 --> 08:21.751
-The skin peeled off like a banana.
-Yeah, not good.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.005
Is that why you're not wearing it?

08:26.589 --> 08:30.760
Or are you getting something
on the side? Well?

08:32.721 --> 08:33.763
That's a yes.

08:33.930 --> 08:38.977
<i>P14. APB.
Rocks thrown at police officer.</i>

08:39.144 --> 08:44.816
<i>Suspect described as male,
15-20 years of age, brown skin.</i>

08:44.983 --> 08:48.570
Is it Rønning?
Are you doing it with Rønning?

08:48.945 --> 08:52.073
-I was her field training officer.
-That makes it even hotter.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.242
A bit of teacher-student action.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.247
Good cop, naughty cop
getting frisky down in lock-up.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.874
Piece of crap.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.338
Relax, Høyer.
I'm just fuckin' with you.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.580
Why can't they wrap it properly?

09:49.881 --> 09:54.260
<i>Internal Affairs have launched an
investigation into whether officers</i>

09:54.427 --> 10:00.266
<i>used excessive force
when restraining Talib Ben Hassi.</i>

10:00.433 --> 10:02.060
Fucking witch hunt.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.813
<i>He</i> attacked them first.

10:06.231 --> 10:10.527
Have you seen him? He's big as fuck.
Of course they got on top of him.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.490
And then some dickhead with a desk

10:15.615 --> 10:17.450
gets to decide
if it was right or wrong.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.869
He tore through the city
doing 130 mph.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.955
It's a miracle
he didn't kill someone.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.378
But no one talks about that.
What if he hit a kid?

10:28.586 --> 10:32.549
-Let's listen to something else.
-The driver has the radio.

10:39.014 --> 10:43.351
You've got balls. Fine. You're
in charge of the entertainment.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.647
You haven't said a damn word all day.
And I'm bored out of my skull.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.149
Tell me a story.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.278
What do you wanna know?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.700
Your biggest fuckup on the job.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.871
-I've never fucked up once.
-C'mon, everyone has.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.209
Go on! Spill it.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.382
Well? Come on.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.469
I was still in training…

11:18.553 --> 11:25.435
One day I was sent to the basement
to get a box of CS grenades.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.561
Yeah?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.646
I get the box,

11:29.147 --> 11:31.941
but as I lift it, the pin is pulled
from one of the grenades.

11:32.359 --> 11:37.155
-Shit. What did you do?
-What the hell do you think? I ran.

11:38.323 --> 11:42.118
I slammed the door
and heard a giant bang.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.915
-And one more. And one more.
-They all blew up? Fuck, man!

11:47.207 --> 11:50.627
-Isn't the storage explosion proof?
-Sure.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.421
Armored door and 80-inch-thick walls.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.215
I just thought it was gonna cost me

11:55.340 --> 11:57.133
a lot of cleaning
and a round of beers.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.553
But then I heard
all the fire alarms go off upstairs.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.972
People were running around screaming.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.558
Gas had spread
to the entire building.

12:05.684 --> 12:09.854
-Damn, what a fuckup, man.
-But that wasn't the worst of it.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.523
There's more?

12:15.902 --> 12:18.321
It took half an hour
for someone to remember

12:18.446 --> 12:20.073
the two gypsies down in lockup.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.879
Goddamn…

12:36.297 --> 12:41.052
So they were down there
puking their lungs out? Damn.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.353
Fuck 'em. Fucking gypsies.
Am I right?

12:51.688 --> 12:52.981
That'll fucking teach them.

12:57.861 --> 13:00.780
-Ready to go?
-Sure.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.915
Fucking gypsies, man.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.879
They think they can get a warm bed,
a free meal and Skinemax on TV.

13:17.380 --> 13:20.467
They always commit
their crimes before 7 p.m.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.385
so they don't miss dinner.

13:24.429 --> 13:28.558
A gypsy stealing a roast from a store
costs the state 50,000 kroner.

13:28.975 --> 13:34.856
But if you need a new note pad, you
have to send three applications to…

13:35.023 --> 13:38.318
P14, P14. Inquiry on a vehicle.
Romeo 14-05. Over.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.196
<i>Romeo 14-05. Go ahead.</i>

13:41.363 --> 13:46.451
P14. Vehicle inquiry
on Bravo Mike 79757.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.829
I repeat, BM 79757.
Romeo 14-05. Over.

13:49.996 --> 13:54.793
-What's up?
-Grey Mercedes. It's just a hunch.

13:56.419 --> 13:59.381
<i>Romeo 14-05. Bravo Mike 79757.</i>

13:59.547 --> 14:02.967
<i>Unknown Mercedes E-Class
registered to Hamza Alfarsi. Come.</i>

14:03.885 --> 14:05.929
P14. Copy that. Romeo 14-05. Over.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.807
Osman's car.
Hamza's part of his crew.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.521
Did you see that?

14:16.523 --> 14:19.025
They've spotted us. Make sure they
don't throw anything out the window.

14:33.415 --> 14:34.833
They're heading for Svalegården.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.626
Aren't we supposed to
stay outta there?

14:37.127 --> 14:38.628
There's a minor in the backseat.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.187
SVALEGÅRDEN
NEVER FORGETS

16:06.383 --> 16:08.802
-Wassup, Mike?
-Turn that shit off.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.058
Get out of the car, both of you.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.575
-What the hell do you feed that guy?
-Him? Potatoes.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.453
-Just potatoes?
-Yeah.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.123
Where'd your gangster intern run to?

16:38.289 --> 16:40.166
The only gangster here is you, boss.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.420
-Why was he in your car?
-He's my cousin.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.638
What is it with you boys and perfume?
You smell like a whorehouse.

16:54.723 --> 16:57.809
Or is it your mom, I smell? Huh?

17:01.604 --> 17:05.984
I'm telling you for the last time.
Stay away from the kids. Got it?

17:08.945 --> 17:11.281
You just stay right there.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.454
Of course.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.539
Good.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.085
Great. Now piss off.

18:19.891 --> 18:25.271
<i>Romeo 14-05, we can see
that you're in Svalegården. Come.</i>

18:25.605 --> 18:27.524
P14. We're following up
on a suspicious vehicle.

18:27.649 --> 18:28.733
Romeo 14-05. Over.

18:29.192 --> 18:32.362
<i>Romeo 14-05. Copy that.
Wrap it up and get out.</i>

18:32.529 --> 18:36.241
-When is your deposition?
-I don't know.

18:36.825 --> 18:41.579
I've been through it a few times.
Let me know if you need to talk.

18:42.163 --> 18:45.166
-Sure. Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.837
Come on, Sami. I can do it.

18:49.045 --> 18:52.465
Iza, we've been over this.
You're not old enough.

18:52.632 --> 18:57.053
-I want to be a Big Brother, Sami.
-I know, but you're not old enough.

18:57.303 --> 19:02.851
Wanna help out? Start cleaning up.
We'll talk about it later. Okay?

19:03.601 --> 19:04.686
Watch out.

19:06.104 --> 19:11.067
-You've got your hands full.
-Yes. He wants to be a Big Brother.

19:11.234 --> 19:15.071
-Shouldn't he ask his parents?
-Not that kind of big brother.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.199
Big Brothers are older boys

19:18.324 --> 19:21.077
who walk our streets at night
to make them safe.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.879
-I didn't expect you to come.
-You called for us?

19:50.482 --> 19:52.817
Old guy's getting kinda fat, huh?

19:57.113 --> 19:59.866
DIE PIGS

20:01.743 --> 20:03.328
Who wrote this shit?

20:06.122 --> 20:11.127
-Hello! Anyone home?
-Why are you asking me?

20:11.294 --> 20:13.546
-Tough guy, huh?
-Yeah, just like you.

20:14.297 --> 20:17.175
Daniel and Iza,
go get some fresh air.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.094
Yallah, come on.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.390
I don't know why you bother.

20:23.515 --> 20:27.394
They have everything
and still trash the place.

20:28.603 --> 20:32.524
-Maybe they just want some attention.
-Right. Play the victim card.

20:32.691 --> 20:34.317
There are no victims here.

20:34.526 --> 20:36.069
We take responsibility
for our actions.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.863
Like when you sat in the backseat
of my squad car?

20:40.198 --> 20:44.494
-Anything else?
-We saw Osman with a kid.

20:44.953 --> 20:47.205
He recruits them right outside,
you know that, right?

20:48.206 --> 20:51.001
-I'll take care of it.
-No, you won't. We will.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.003
Then you should come around more.

20:53.128 --> 20:54.337
Right, we've got
nothing better to do.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.840
Sami! Sami! Hurry outside!

21:02.637 --> 21:03.638
Hey!

21:06.349 --> 21:08.768
Hey. What's going on?

21:08.935 --> 21:11.062
She's trying to make us
sound like ignorant ragheads.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.355
I don't wanna hear that language!

21:12.480 --> 21:16.026
I just asked what you think about
what happened to Talib.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.862
You just want to start some trouble
for your stupid TV show!

21:19.821 --> 21:23.241
-You tried to give me money!
-You can give me some.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.745
-Give me money, man!
-This isn't funny!

21:27.037 --> 21:29.706
We're not done cleaning, guys.
Let's go. Come on.

21:31.708 --> 21:35.003
-Can I ask you a few questions?
-No, please leave.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.256
Don't worry about them.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.592
Is there any truth to the allegations

21:40.759 --> 21:42.552
against the cops
in the Ben Hassi case?

21:43.178 --> 21:46.931
If you have questions, direct them
to our spokesperson, okay? Thank you.

21:48.933 --> 21:52.562
The arrest was described
as a violent assault. Any comment?

21:54.230 --> 21:57.734
-Did you try to bribe them?
-We always pay expert sources.

21:57.901 --> 22:00.570
They don't even have pubes yet.
What the hell are they experts on?

22:01.571 --> 22:05.450
-They deserve to tell their…
-You're just here to stir up trouble.

22:05.784 --> 22:07.452
Isn't that what you're doing?

22:08.745 --> 22:11.247
You have two minutes
to pack up your shit and leave.

22:14.584 --> 22:17.128
Step aside, please.

22:18.129 --> 22:21.424
-Denmark has freedom of the press.
-Look around.

22:22.842 --> 22:26.221
-This isn't Denmark.
-Could you repeat that, please?

22:26.429 --> 22:30.225
-And look straight into the camera.
-If I see you again, you're going in.

22:31.226 --> 22:32.519
Understood?

22:33.478 --> 22:34.771
Sure.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.108
What a dickhead.

22:41.152 --> 22:42.737
Come here, please.

22:43.655 --> 22:45.073
-What?
-Come here.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.575
-Don't.
-No, it's okay.

22:51.329 --> 22:52.580
What did you say?

22:53.998 --> 22:57.335
-That we have freedom of the press…
-What did you say?

22:58.712 --> 23:00.046
That's not a good idea.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.632
Let's go.

23:11.766 --> 23:15.478
-What?
-Nothing.

23:41.254 --> 23:42.464
Fucking bitch.

23:44.007 --> 23:47.427
We put on this target every day
so she can sleep soundly at night.

23:47.886 --> 23:49.554
We have to show who's in charge.

23:49.721 --> 23:53.058
Otherwise we can't come in here
without an army watching our backs.

23:53.183 --> 23:55.018
You gotta be on top
of them constantly.

23:55.352 --> 23:59.022
-It's the only thing they understand.
-They're young.

23:59.481 --> 24:02.692
-Didn't you get in trouble as a kid?
-Sure!

24:03.777 --> 24:07.572
But I became a police officer.
They become criminals.

24:08.031 --> 24:12.369
First, they give you the finger.
Then call you names and spit on you.

24:12.535 --> 24:17.457
And one day they shove a gun in your
face. Have you tried that? Have you?!

24:17.624 --> 24:19.709
-No.
-No! You haven't.

24:20.585 --> 24:24.422
But I have. And it sure as shit
changes your perspective.

24:26.424 --> 24:28.802
And when you've been doing this
for as long as I have,

24:29.302 --> 24:30.553
you'll agree with me.

24:32.389 --> 24:34.516
Yes. Okay.

24:40.188 --> 24:41.815
Yes…

24:41.981 --> 24:43.233
Okay.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.448
What the hell
are you looking at, dipshit?

25:06.256 --> 25:07.465
-ID?
-No.

25:07.590 --> 25:11.761
-Name and Social Security number.
-Amos Al-Shami. 0-7-0-6-0-2.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.889
-And the last four…
-I don't have to tell you.

25:15.640 --> 25:20.145
-Got something to hide?
-No, do you? What's <i>your</i> number?

25:20.311 --> 25:23.231
-I should be able to see your number.
-You can have mine.

25:28.778 --> 25:31.322
-Why are you stopping me?
-Stop filming.

25:31.448 --> 25:32.490
Is it against the law?

25:32.615 --> 25:34.034
If it interferes
with police business.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.078
-You stopped me for no reason.
-Listen, Amos.

25:37.996 --> 25:41.916
You're being detained for a search.
Drop your phone and your bag.

25:42.083 --> 25:46.171
-On what grounds?
-You'll find out.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.799
-You don't have the legal authority.
-Wow, those are some fancy words.

25:50.759 --> 25:52.677
-But…
-Shut it,

25:52.802 --> 25:54.346
or I throw your ass in jail.

25:55.180 --> 25:56.306
You don't want that.

25:58.308 --> 25:59.559
Am I right?

26:10.528 --> 26:12.530
This is an illegal search.

26:16.451 --> 26:18.328
Anything in your pockets
I can cut myself on?

26:20.955 --> 26:22.832
-Jacket, shoes and socks.
-Andersen?

26:23.375 --> 26:26.252
Keep an eye on them.
Okay, get moving.

26:36.554 --> 26:38.181
Let's go! We don't have all day.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.479
Are we done?

26:45.397 --> 26:47.816
No. Not quite.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.652
Gotta check those drawers, too.

26:52.737 --> 26:56.074
Drop your pants. Drop your pants.

26:57.701 --> 26:58.868
Come on!

27:03.456 --> 27:04.916
Take 'em off!

27:10.505 --> 27:12.173
Hey! What the fuck is going on?

27:16.720 --> 27:19.305
Nope. Not much to see here.

27:22.851 --> 27:27.272
You eye-fucking me,
you little prick? Are ya?

27:28.982 --> 27:30.400
Wanna hit me?

27:32.610 --> 27:34.029
Well?

27:37.323 --> 27:39.075
I think we're done here.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.415
Yes.

27:47.459 --> 27:48.877
We are now.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.055
Fuck off!

28:36.633 --> 28:37.967
Got something to say?

28:54.776 --> 28:56.111
Fine.

29:50.081 --> 29:51.458
Hey! Stop.

29:57.922 --> 30:00.342
-Let go!
-Stand still!

30:02.218 --> 30:05.597
Throwing things at the police,
you fucking raghead? Huh?

30:32.332 --> 30:35.293
-Where are your buddies?
-I had nothing to do with it!

30:35.418 --> 30:38.421
-Then why did you run?
-You were chasing me!

30:38.880 --> 30:42.342
-Why are we wasting time on this?
-Tell me where they are.

30:43.134 --> 30:49.683
<i>P14. Be advised. Talib Ben Hassi

30:53.103 --> 30:55.355
<i>Use caution. Over.</i>

31:14.332 --> 31:16.042
That's what happens when…

31:23.425 --> 31:24.968

31:25.844 --> 31:26.803
Down!

Come on! Come on!

33:27.924 --> 33:29.092
Move!

33:45.025 --> 33:46.776
Fucking animals!

33:52.699 --> 33:55.035
Hey, what's going on?

33:55.994 --> 34:00.248
Police officer. Go back inside!
Go back inside!

34:06.838 --> 34:10.175
Hey, hey! Follow this.

34:15.305 --> 34:18.224
-Does it hurt anywhere?
-No.

34:21.311 --> 34:24.439

-Kærnebidervej.
-Kærnebidervej.

35:19.369 --> 35:23.915
Our vehicle is wrecked, and we need
help immediately. Romeo 14-05. Over.

35:47.731 --> 35:49.357
They don't wanna
fucking come in here.

35:52.610 --> 35:54.112
Jesus Christ…

35:56.489 --> 35:57.741
Fuck.

36:13.214 --> 36:14.466
Stay right there.

36:19.179 --> 36:20.638
I think this is your size.

36:22.849 --> 36:25.352
-We have to let him go…
-He's coming with us.

36:26.895 --> 36:29.606
He's the only one who knows
where those little bastards are.

37:20.990 --> 37:24.536
-How do we get out of here?
-Why should I tell you?

37:25.412 --> 37:28.373
Shut up. You seem
to know your rights.

37:28.998 --> 37:30.458
'Cause you're always stopping me.

37:30.625 --> 37:34.421
Then you know you can seek damages
for wrongful arrest.

37:41.136 --> 37:42.637
No one will believe me.

37:48.643 --> 37:50.145
You can call me as a witness.

38:19.132 --> 38:23.261
So… how much money can I get?

38:30.560 --> 38:32.187
How do we get out?

38:38.109 --> 38:41.071
-There.
-And where are we now?

38:43.907 --> 38:44.866
There.

38:52.165 --> 38:56.878
-P14. P14. Romeo 14-05. Over.
<i>-Romeo 14-05. Go ahead.</i>

38:57.420 --> 39:00.507
P14. We're heading for
the parking lot on Tornskadevej.

39:00.632 --> 39:01.758
Romeo 14-05. Over.

39:01.925 --> 39:05.011
<i>Romeo 14-05, copy that. Over.</i>

39:44.634 --> 39:47.345
Stop! Stop it…!

39:47.512 --> 39:48.805
Stop!

39:53.476 --> 39:57.022
Stop! Stop! I said stop!

39:57.230 --> 39:59.899
-Stop it!
-Hey!

40:00.150 --> 40:03.445
-Stop! I said stop!
-Hey!

40:03.737 --> 40:06.406
Put that shit down! Put it down!

40:06.573 --> 40:09.325
-Stop!
-Go back in your fucking store!

40:09.617 --> 40:12.162
I've got this. Police! Put that down!

40:12.620 --> 40:15.999
On the ground! Now!

40:19.210 --> 40:21.171
Stay down!

40:45.653 --> 40:50.825
It's your lucky day, you greasy fuck.
I'd put a bullet in that fat belly.

40:55.288 --> 40:57.040
Høyer, got a handle on it?

41:06.716 --> 41:09.594
Come in here! Hurry!

41:10.679 --> 41:12.514
Come on! Hurry!

41:31.866 --> 41:34.244
They're from the police.

41:35.912 --> 41:37.997
About goddamn time.

41:38.832 --> 41:42.043
-Go home. It's not safe here.
-I have to protect my store.

41:42.210 --> 41:45.714
-No. That's our job.
-Like they give two shits about you.

41:45.880 --> 41:49.718
-Mind your own business.
-Hell, no. Do your damn job.

41:51.094 --> 41:55.432
You don't live here.
Those damn Pakis terrorize everyone.

41:56.474 --> 41:59.686
I've known Samir and Nadia
for over 20 years.

42:00.729 --> 42:02.605
Now they have to close their store.

42:02.814 --> 42:05.025
'Cause everyone's
afraid to come here.

42:05.233 --> 42:09.863
-That's not fucking…
-Hey! Shut your trap.

42:11.823 --> 42:13.158
They come here every day.

42:13.324 --> 42:15.827
They steal, they
threaten my customers,

42:16.036 --> 42:18.705
and when I call the police,
nothing happens.

42:22.208 --> 42:25.462
Why do you do it?
Why don't you have any respect?

42:26.379 --> 42:27.756
What are you laughing at?

42:29.007 --> 42:31.968
What do you get out of it?

42:37.140 --> 42:38.808
Hey, calm down. Come here.

42:42.729 --> 42:46.900
-You make friends all over the place.
-Yeah. Envious?

42:47.025 --> 42:52.405
<i>…the death of Talib Ben Hassi.
Ben Hassi was on life support,</i>

42:52.572 --> 42:58.787
<i>but today his family decided
to turn off the respirator.</i>

42:59.662 --> 43:03.875
<i>This has angered immigrant youths,
and 23 have so far been arrested</i>

43:04.000 --> 43:07.420
<i>after violent clashes
with police across the country.</i>

43:10.465 --> 43:12.258
My mom says to give you this.

43:14.219 --> 43:17.472
<i>Many have taken to social media
to voice their outrage.</i>

43:17.806 --> 43:22.811
<i>"My heart bleeds for Ben Hassi,"

43:23.019 --> 43:27.691
<i>who calls Ben Hassi's death a
disgrace that can never be justified.</i>

43:28.650 --> 43:30.485
What did you do?

43:34.906 --> 43:37.409
Shot a guy who got in my face.

43:40.662 --> 43:42.122
I'm kidding.

43:43.206 --> 43:48.253
I didn't do anything.
The cops are just bored.

44:12.986 --> 44:14.320
Hey.

44:22.203 --> 44:24.706
-Are you okay?
-Sure.

44:36.634 --> 44:38.887
I think we got off
on the wrong foot, Høyer.

44:41.389 --> 44:44.434
That's why the Captain and I
decided we should ride together.

44:46.770 --> 44:50.565
-People talk, you know.
-Oh? And what do people say?

44:52.192 --> 44:57.155
You haven't given your statement yet.
You seem unsure of what to say.

44:57.989 --> 44:59.282
That makes people nervous.

44:59.407 --> 45:01.034
And people do stupid things
when they're nervous.

45:03.620 --> 45:06.498
-Are you threatening me?
-No, no.

45:07.207 --> 45:08.625
Not at all.

45:12.587 --> 45:14.881
We just need to know
if we can count on you.

45:15.924 --> 45:19.969
We both know Kofoed and Poulsen
aren't the hairiest nuts in the sack.

45:20.136 --> 45:24.099
What they did was stupid,
and they know that.

45:24.265 --> 45:25.809
They went too far.

45:27.018 --> 45:30.397
But they only had a split second
to react, and they made a mistake.

45:30.647 --> 45:32.315
Because they were afraid.

45:33.066 --> 45:36.319
Look how fast
you almost lost control before.

45:40.115 --> 45:42.742
They don't deserve to have
their lives destroyed over this.

45:42.909 --> 45:45.120
What about Talib Ben Hassi's life?

45:47.414 --> 45:51.459
We gotta have each other's back
or we won't survive.

45:52.919 --> 45:56.506
And who knows? Maybe you're
the one who needs help next time.

46:00.135 --> 46:01.886
Don't worry. I'll keep my mouth shut.

46:02.012 --> 46:03.138
No. You won't.

46:04.097 --> 46:06.808
You're gonna tell them what happened.
You weren't there.

46:07.225 --> 46:11.271
You were doing paperwork,
emptying the dishwasher,

46:11.438 --> 46:13.523
or jerking off, I don't give a shit.

46:15.316 --> 46:16.568
But you didn't see anything.

46:21.197 --> 46:22.449
Do you understand?

46:37.130 --> 46:39.049
What's going on out here?

46:42.469 --> 46:49.017
AVENGE TALIB

46:49.726 --> 46:51.394
Who sent this?

46:58.026 --> 46:59.361
I don't know.

47:02.864 --> 47:05.116
-What are you doing?
-He got it, too.

47:05.408 --> 47:08.745
-Everyone got it.
-What if they show up here?

47:08.912 --> 47:13.041
-Don't worry, we'll protect you.
-It's safer if you leave.

47:13.416 --> 47:15.043
That's what she's trying to say.

48:01.256 --> 48:02.757
Where have I seen you before?

48:04.968 --> 48:06.720
Did you play soccer
in the Police Youth Club?

48:08.221 --> 48:11.683
My buddy was a coach there for
a while. You were their star player.

48:11.975 --> 48:15.812
Really? This guy?
I could play circles around you.

48:15.979 --> 48:17.939
You couldn't even catch me.

48:18.064 --> 48:22.444
Well, you don't have a bad meniscus
and torn ligaments. What?

48:27.407 --> 48:31.494
You must be an Arsenal fan.
All brown boys love Arsenal.

48:31.661 --> 48:35.373
-And all cops love Real Madrid.
-Who's your best player? Özil?

48:36.207 --> 48:38.084
He gets 3 mil for scratching his ass.

48:38.251 --> 48:39.919
He's better than Benzema.

48:40.086 --> 48:43.381
You just say that
because we stole him from you.

48:43.882 --> 48:47.761
Benzema has won everything.
Arsenal players are such bitches.

48:47.927 --> 48:50.638
They won't do the hard work,
so they never win.

48:51.014 --> 48:53.975
And Real Madrid spends billions
on whore players.

48:54.184 --> 48:58.980
But they're hardcore super whores.
First Ronaldo and now Hazard.

49:00.648 --> 49:01.900
Why don't you play anymore?

49:03.902 --> 49:07.864
-Your buddy kicked me off the team.
-Why? What did you do?

49:08.448 --> 49:12.118
-Nothing.
-Of course. The epitome of innocence.

49:13.870 --> 49:16.456
A guy called Rasmus
kept provoking me.

49:17.207 --> 49:19.000
So I told him to meet me
after practice,

49:19.125 --> 49:20.669
if he had a problem with me.

49:20.960 --> 49:24.089
-Fighting is pretty dumb.
-He never showed up.

49:24.881 --> 49:27.550
He said I threatened him
with a knife.

49:27.717 --> 49:28.718
Did you?

49:29.177 --> 49:31.680
Why don't you just
play somewhere else?

49:32.639 --> 49:34.849
Fuck it. It's a waste of time.

49:36.893 --> 49:41.606
<i>Romeo 14-05. Charlie 14-02 will
arrive at Tornskadevej in 5 minutes.</i>

50:00.458 --> 50:01.793
Do you think that's them?

50:15.056 --> 50:17.726
P14. P14. Romeo 14-05. Come in.

50:18.768 --> 50:20.020
<i>Romeo 14-05. Go ahead.</i>

50:21.271 --> 50:25.275
P14. We're at the contact point.
Can Charlie 14-02 flash their lights?

50:26.568 --> 50:31.656
<i>Romeo 14-05 arrived at contact point.
Charlie 14-02. Flash your lights.</i>

50:32.615 --> 50:35.493
<i>P14. Copy that.
Charlie 14-02. Over.</i>

50:37.787 --> 50:39.622
Møller, you son of a bitch,

50:39.789 --> 50:42.000
this is the first time
I'm happy to hear your voice.

50:42.125 --> 50:45.337
<i>Romeo 14-05.
Someone's gotta save your ass…</i>

52:10.005 --> 52:12.924
You fucking dog!
Think you can get away from us?

52:13.091 --> 52:16.261
We're gonna kill you!
You and your fucking family!

53:16.112 --> 53:21.284
P14. P14. Charlie 14-02 met with
Molotovs. Headed north on foot.

53:21.451 --> 53:26.373
Tornskadevej is blocked.
We can't get out. Romeo 14-05. Over.

53:26.915 --> 53:29.918
<i>Romeo 14-05…
I have nothing to send you.</i>

53:32.003 --> 53:36.007
P14. What do you mean?
What the hell are we supposed to do?

53:37.842 --> 53:44.516
<i>Romeo 14-05. That's your call.
No confirmation. Out.</i>

54:08.540 --> 54:11.793
-Are you okay?
-I can't feel my hands.

54:12.460 --> 54:14.045
They're just asleep.

54:28.560 --> 54:33.648
-Where do you live?
-Solriksvej 37. 14th floor.

54:34.065 --> 54:35.525
Is it far?

54:44.826 --> 54:48.496
We're not getting out of here
anytime soon, and he lives close by.

54:50.206 --> 54:52.751
Maybe we should go to his place
until things settle down.

54:53.335 --> 54:55.086
You wanna hide at <i>his</i> place?

54:56.421 --> 54:58.131
-Yes.
-No.

54:58.965 --> 55:03.720
-Would you rather shoot your way out?
-We'll find another way.

55:04.137 --> 55:07.223
-There is no other way.
-He's not going anywhere.

55:09.059 --> 55:12.187
-This is all your fault.
-You could've stopped me.

55:13.938 --> 55:18.193
You could've stopped Kofoed
and Poulsen. You were right there.

55:19.235 --> 55:22.072
But you didn't do a damn thing.

55:23.907 --> 55:25.325
Right?

55:31.623 --> 55:35.752
Get up. Come. Get up.
You're coming with me.

55:38.797 --> 55:40.215
Wanna get out of the way?

55:42.092 --> 55:47.222
-Cut the shit.
-You're a snake in the grass, Høyer.

55:47.389 --> 55:49.307
Fine. Are you gonna move?

55:49.891 --> 55:53.478
You'd rather protect those jackals
than your own colleagues?

55:54.729 --> 56:00.110
You bet your ass. And I'm gonna tell
everyone what happened to Ben Hassi.

56:00.276 --> 56:03.947
You won't say shit, you little bitch.

56:05.990 --> 56:08.868
Or you'll find out
just how alone you really are.

56:09.619 --> 56:13.081
Fuck you. And fuck your friends.

56:18.920 --> 56:21.506
Where the hell do you think
you're going?!

57:26.780 --> 57:28.281
Had enough?

58:41.104 --> 58:43.898
Cover your eyes! Cover your eyes.

59:00.915 --> 59:05.587
-I can't see anything!
-Don't touch your eyes. It'll pass.

59:05.754 --> 59:07.964
-Just breathe.
-It hurts!

59:08.131 --> 59:09.632
Just breathe.

59:11.926 --> 59:13.595
Is that where you live?

59:14.554 --> 59:17.599
-No… yes.
-Is there a back entrance?

59:17.766 --> 59:19.100
No.

59:22.771 --> 59:26.441
-Hey! What the hell are you doing?
-None of your business!

59:26.608 --> 59:29.152
-Little bitch!
-Get outta here!

59:29.319 --> 59:33.073
Shut your mouth, dumbass bitch!

59:33.239 --> 59:35.617
Fuck you!

1:00:29.754 --> 1:00:32.173
Hey, what's going on?

1:00:34.009 --> 1:00:36.344
Hey! What is it?

1:00:38.179 --> 1:00:40.265
Nothing!

1:01:20.013 --> 1:01:21.931
Stay out!

1:01:23.350 --> 1:01:25.435
Fucking ragheads!

1:02:12.649 --> 1:02:13.900
Can I…

1:02:14.275 --> 1:02:15.985
Wait…

1:02:52.439 --> 1:02:55.108
Is there someplace else we can go?

1:02:55.275 --> 1:02:57.861
-No.
-Okay.

1:03:00.238 --> 1:03:01.906
We'll figure something out.

1:03:04.868 --> 1:03:06.327
What about your partner?

1:03:08.913 --> 1:03:10.248
Is he gonna be okay?

1:03:11.166 --> 1:03:13.668
The most important thing
is to get you to safety.

1:03:27.891 --> 1:03:29.684
I threw that milkshake at your car.

1:03:46.659 --> 1:03:48.078
I know.

1:03:50.747 --> 1:03:52.332
But you throw like a bitch.

1:05:34.601 --> 1:05:35.852
What are you doing?

1:05:37.896 --> 1:05:40.523
You've lost a lot of blood.
You need to sit down.

1:05:57.374 --> 1:06:00.418
I'm Abia. I'm a nurse.

1:06:02.545 --> 1:06:07.801
The bleeding has stopped.
I've given you a saline drip.

1:06:49.092 --> 1:06:50.552
Hi.

1:07:00.687 --> 1:07:02.272
What's your name?

1:07:07.819 --> 1:07:09.529
Is it a secret?

1:07:11.823 --> 1:07:12.949
Okay.

1:07:14.117 --> 1:07:15.827
How old are you?

1:07:19.581 --> 1:07:20.999
20?

1:07:22.417 --> 1:07:23.877
Okay.

1:07:24.044 --> 1:07:25.670
37?

1:07:30.050 --> 1:07:33.094
Oh, I know. You're 89 years old.

1:07:35.513 --> 1:07:37.557
I'm actually five years old.

1:07:38.350 --> 1:07:39.559
Wow.

1:07:41.144 --> 1:07:43.772
Just like my son. He's five, too.

1:07:43.938 --> 1:07:47.233
Hey, you. Back to bed now.

1:07:49.152 --> 1:07:53.698
-But it's noisy outside.
-You can sleep in my bed.

1:07:54.324 --> 1:07:56.701
Mommy, who's that man?

1:07:57.118 --> 1:08:00.205
He hurt himself
and needs a bit of help.

1:08:00.830 --> 1:08:03.625
But when's Amos coming home?

1:08:03.792 --> 1:08:05.543
He'll be home soon.

1:09:14.070 --> 1:09:17.615
2017
TALENT OF THE YEAR

1:09:49.773 --> 1:09:52.525
-I think the food is…
-Shit!

1:10:10.043 --> 1:10:13.588
-How are you feeling?
-Much better, thank you.

1:10:17.842 --> 1:10:22.764
-Are these your kids?
-Uhm… yes.

1:10:23.306 --> 1:10:30.230
Amira, whom you've met
and Amos… my son.

1:10:32.857 --> 1:10:34.109
Where is he?

1:10:35.151 --> 1:10:38.655
I don't know.
He should've been home by now.

1:10:39.948 --> 1:10:41.533
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

1:10:44.744 --> 1:10:48.540
-It won't be a culinary feast…
-No, no. I don't want to intrude.

1:10:48.665 --> 1:10:50.792
You need to eat something.

1:10:59.134 --> 1:11:02.971
VIOLENT RIOTS

1:11:07.267 --> 1:11:14.107
<i>…a different situation with cars
and containers on fire</i>

1:11:14.274 --> 1:11:18.528
<i>and rocks and fireworks
being aimed at police.</i>

1:11:18.695 --> 1:11:24.743
<i>Hundreds of people have left flowers
where Talib Ben Hassi was arrested.</i>

1:11:24.909 --> 1:11:28.997
<i>Talib Ben Hassi's mother,
Rose Ben Hassi, spoke to us earlier,</i>

1:11:29.164 --> 1:11:33.626
<i>and pleaded with both police
and protestors to stop the violence.</i>

1:11:35.670 --> 1:11:39.716
<i>Don't fight because of Talib.
Talib wasn't violent.</i>

1:11:40.216 --> 1:11:42.135
<i>He was a sweet and happy boy.</i>

1:11:43.303 --> 1:11:45.805
<i>He was a good brother and son.</i>

1:11:47.891 --> 1:11:49.726
<i>And now I'll never see him again.</i>

1:11:51.644 --> 1:11:53.980
<i>Don't fight in his name.</i>

1:11:55.273 --> 1:11:58.485
<i>I don't want any more parents
to lose their children.</i>

1:11:59.944 --> 1:12:04.741
<i>More than 60 have been arrested, and
more than 30 protesters and officers</i>

1:12:04.908 --> 1:12:09.746
<i>have been injured in what is called
the worst riots in Denmark ever.</i>

1:12:23.718 --> 1:12:25.178
Do you have kids?

1:12:27.639 --> 1:12:29.015
Yes.

1:12:44.072 --> 1:12:47.367
My mother used to say
that being a parent

1:12:47.534 --> 1:12:52.288
is like having your heart walk
around in the world unprotected.

1:13:00.213 --> 1:13:02.799
He's a good boy. Amos.

1:13:04.592 --> 1:13:07.095
He's just always so angry.

1:13:10.473 --> 1:13:14.561
And I get it. No matter what he does,
it's never good enough.

1:13:22.068 --> 1:13:24.863
If you're always treated like
something you're not,

1:13:25.363 --> 1:13:26.906
you end up believing it.

1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:31.327
But I'm sure you already know that.

1:13:43.089 --> 1:13:44.799
I'm sure your son is all right.

1:13:50.472 --> 1:13:52.432
Yes…

1:15:24.899 --> 1:15:27.235
You think you can shoot at us,
you fucking faggot?

1:15:29.070 --> 1:15:30.780
Do you wanna die?!

1:15:31.573 --> 1:15:33.158
Do you wanna die?!

1:15:34.409 --> 1:15:35.785
Do you?!

1:15:38.705 --> 1:15:41.583
Don't look at him! He can't help you!

1:15:43.376 --> 1:15:47.756
You're all alone now, fucking pig.
No one's gonna help you!

1:16:01.144 --> 1:16:03.855
Amos, get his gun.

1:16:05.565 --> 1:16:07.233
Take his fucking gun!

1:16:30.090 --> 1:16:32.008
What the fuck are you doing?

1:16:34.219 --> 1:16:36.221
What the fuck are you doing, man?!

1:16:47.023 --> 1:16:48.274
Get back.

1:16:48.441 --> 1:16:50.568
Get the fuck away now!

1:17:02.706 --> 1:17:04.082
Relax.

1:17:06.793 --> 1:17:09.004
Calm down. Come on.

1:17:10.255 --> 1:17:11.423
Leave him.

1:17:12.340 --> 1:17:13.800
Leave him.

1:17:15.051 --> 1:17:16.302
Come on.

1:17:39.075 --> 1:17:40.785
MOM

1:17:47.625 --> 1:17:49.794
Why do you have Amos's phone?

1:17:54.090 --> 1:17:57.302
-Where is my son?
-He's with my colleague.

1:17:59.137 --> 1:18:02.307
He threw something at our car
so we had to arrest him.

1:18:04.184 --> 1:18:06.895
We tried taking him home,
but we got separated.

1:18:08.646 --> 1:18:12.609
They were on their way here…
Something must've happened.

1:18:18.406 --> 1:18:20.742
-Help!
-Be quiet!

1:18:20.909 --> 1:18:23.453
Be quiet! Quiet.

1:18:24.454 --> 1:18:27.707
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you!

1:18:29.334 --> 1:18:33.505
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Look at me. Look at me.

1:18:34.339 --> 1:18:36.007
<i>Abia?</i>

1:18:36.174 --> 1:18:40.929
-I'll find Amos. I promise.
-<i>Abia? Open the door.</i>

1:18:41.096 --> 1:18:45.266
-I'll get your son home.
-<i>Abia, open the door.</i>

1:18:45.433 --> 1:18:48.144
-Mommy?
-<i>Abia? Are you okay?</i>

1:18:48.311 --> 1:18:50.480
<i>Open the door! Abia!</i>

1:18:50.647 --> 1:18:52.065
<i>Abia!</i>

1:18:53.274 --> 1:18:55.193
<i>Abia, what's going on?</i>

1:18:56.236 --> 1:18:58.780
<i>Kick down the door.</i>

1:18:58.947 --> 1:19:01.366
<i>If you're behind the door, move away!</i>

1:19:27.559 --> 1:19:31.604
Step back. Police. Step back.

1:19:31.771 --> 1:19:34.649
-What the fuck is going on?
-Stay out of it.

1:19:34.816 --> 1:19:39.904
-Where's Abia? What's happening?
-Stay out of it! Shut the fuck up!

1:19:40.071 --> 1:19:44.451
-Go back inside.
-Don't fucking tell me what to do!

1:19:44.617 --> 1:19:46.786
-Fuck you!
-Move! Move!

1:19:46.953 --> 1:19:50.373
Why are you just standing there?!

1:19:50.540 --> 1:19:53.626
That's right.
Keep walking, you loser!

1:19:55.045 --> 1:19:59.507
Abia? Amira? Where are you? Abia?

1:20:06.222 --> 1:20:08.350
What's up, Mike?

1:20:19.110 --> 1:20:23.114
-Go back inside.
-You're knee-deep in shit, huh?

1:20:24.324 --> 1:20:28.328
Do you have shit in your ears?
Go back inside!

1:20:32.624 --> 1:20:34.209
Now!

1:20:36.836 --> 1:20:40.048
Is that supposed to be a real gun?

1:20:45.053 --> 1:20:47.430
Wanna find out?

1:20:49.182 --> 1:20:50.850
Well?

1:21:02.779 --> 1:21:04.698
Shut the door.

1:21:04.864 --> 1:21:07.283
Shut the door!

1:21:54.622 --> 1:21:57.292
Go get him, boy.

1:24:09.799 --> 1:24:12.052
Fuck…

1:24:17.515 --> 1:24:22.437
-We have to help him.
-Yeah, right. It's a fucking cop.

1:24:34.991 --> 1:24:37.452
-Check it out.
-It's not a toy!

1:24:37.619 --> 1:24:39.662
Relax, man. I got this.

1:24:54.469 --> 1:24:56.680
It's not a real gun.

1:25:03.061 --> 1:25:07.524
-Weren't you told to stay home?
-Who else is gonna help you?

1:25:08.983 --> 1:25:11.361
-How did you find me?
-It wasn't that hard.

1:25:12.779 --> 1:25:14.406
You're being watched.

1:25:17.701 --> 1:25:19.703
Do you know where my partner is?

1:25:19.869 --> 1:25:23.164
No. But we can help you find him.

1:25:26.084 --> 1:25:27.627
Why would you help me?

1:25:28.336 --> 1:25:32.173
If a cop gets hurt in here,
everything will just get much worse.

1:25:34.801 --> 1:25:36.261
Go on home.

1:25:39.305 --> 1:25:40.932
I can get a car!

1:25:59.117 --> 1:26:02.078
-Man, you suck at driving.
-Shut up!

1:26:02.245 --> 1:26:05.957
Step on the clutch.
It's to the left of the brakes.

1:26:06.708 --> 1:26:08.877
Release it and push down
the gas pedal.

1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:23.558
-Whose car is this?
-My dad's.

1:26:23.725 --> 1:26:26.561
-Does he know you're driving it?
-No.

1:26:28.396 --> 1:26:30.148
He doesn't care anyway.

1:26:43.870 --> 1:26:45.622
POLICE

1:27:13.066 --> 1:27:17.987
-Man, they totally ripped it off.
-Shut the fuck up, man.

1:27:32.752 --> 1:27:35.588
P14. P14.
Romeo 14-05. Alpha. Come in.

1:27:36.506 --> 1:27:38.133
<i>Romeo 14-05. Alpha. Go ahead.</i>

1:27:38.299 --> 1:27:40.301
P14. I'm still in Svalegården.

1:27:40.427 --> 1:27:42.429
I don't know where
my colleague is. Over.

1:27:43.013 --> 1:27:47.976
<i>Romeo 14-05 Alpha. Copy that.
Switch to a closed channel.</i>

1:27:51.521 --> 1:27:52.814
Fuck.

1:27:53.606 --> 1:27:56.568
Throw the blanket over him. Hurry!

1:28:16.212 --> 1:28:20.633
What's up, boys?
Driving around in Daddy's car?

1:28:22.594 --> 1:28:25.180
-Have you seen those two cops?
-No.

1:28:25.597 --> 1:28:28.933
-What about your friend?
-He hasn't seen them either.

1:28:29.100 --> 1:28:31.436
Can't he speak for himself?

1:28:32.145 --> 1:28:34.564
Get out. Get out.

1:28:34.731 --> 1:28:39.694
-Me?
-Yeah, who else? Get lost.

1:28:47.702 --> 1:28:51.081
-What do you want? I'm busy.
-Relax.

1:28:51.539 --> 1:28:53.583
We're just gonna have a little talk.

1:28:55.669 --> 1:28:58.338
What's that? Huh?

1:29:03.301 --> 1:29:07.555
Let me know if you want a real one.
And don't tell Sami.

1:29:08.848 --> 1:29:11.434
He wants you to be
a good little Arab,

1:29:12.102 --> 1:29:13.728
but that's not how you get respect.

1:29:13.895 --> 1:29:16.523
-You should also have self-respect.
-Are you saying I don't have that?

1:29:20.026 --> 1:29:21.569
Well?

1:29:26.866 --> 1:29:30.412
That Big Brother crap
doesn't mean shit.

1:29:32.539 --> 1:29:37.168
But we do.
And we need someone like you, Iza.

1:29:40.046 --> 1:29:41.548
You're not a kid anymore. Are you?

1:29:42.590 --> 1:29:45.427
-No.
-Good. That's good.

1:29:47.178 --> 1:29:48.555
So tell me…

1:29:49.973 --> 1:29:51.975
Where's that fucking cop?

1:29:52.934 --> 1:29:55.020
Don't play dumb with me.

1:30:00.233 --> 1:30:02.777
What the fuck are you looking at?

1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:30.138
Come on!

1:31:57.851 --> 1:31:59.519
That was insane, man!

1:32:01.312 --> 1:32:03.231
You blasted all of them!

1:32:04.774 --> 1:32:08.695
-I owe your dad a new car.
-It was a piece of crap anyway.

1:32:17.537 --> 1:32:20.248
Here. This is for you.

1:32:31.801 --> 1:32:33.595
You'd make a great cop.

1:32:38.850 --> 1:32:40.810
Høyer, do you read me? Mike. Over.

1:32:42.354 --> 1:32:44.230
Høyer, do you read me? Mike. Over.

1:32:46.566 --> 1:32:48.068
Look.

1:32:54.908 --> 1:32:59.621
-Is that happening now?
-I'll show you where it is. Let's go.

1:32:59.788 --> 1:33:01.623
Come on!

1:33:01.790 --> 1:33:03.917
Keep up! Let's go! Come on!

1:33:05.043 --> 1:33:06.503
Come on!

1:33:14.052 --> 1:33:17.806
150 NEW APARTMENTS
SURROUNDED BY WONDERFUL NATURE

1:33:48.545 --> 1:33:52.674
-They're over there! Come on!
-Wait, Iza!

1:35:07.916 --> 1:35:09.751
Police! Show me your hands!

1:35:12.253 --> 1:35:13.838
Jens?

1:35:18.218 --> 1:35:19.552
Jens?

1:35:23.431 --> 1:35:25.141
Jens.

1:36:00.885 --> 1:36:02.262
What happened?

1:36:03.346 --> 1:36:04.764
I don't know.

1:36:05.306 --> 1:36:07.434
What do you mean, you don't know?

1:36:08.393 --> 1:36:12.647
He came out of nowhere.
I thought he was one of them.

1:36:52.395 --> 1:36:54.439
I can't go to jail, Mike.

1:36:55.648 --> 1:36:56.941
I can't.

1:37:08.244 --> 1:37:10.538
Mike…

1:37:57.335 --> 1:38:01.798
He was armed and about to shoot.
You acted in self-defense. Say it.

1:38:04.217 --> 1:38:06.302
Hey! Say it.

1:38:08.722 --> 1:38:11.558
He was armed,
I acted in self-defense.

1:38:12.350 --> 1:38:14.144
That's right. This never happened.

1:38:16.730 --> 1:38:18.273
Thank you.

1:38:27.615 --> 1:38:29.200
You dropped this.

1:38:37.709 --> 1:38:39.002
Where's Amos?

1:38:42.589 --> 1:38:44.090
Did he see it?

1:38:48.053 --> 1:38:49.346
Yes.

1:40:11.136 --> 1:40:13.013
You need to get outta here.

1:40:18.184 --> 1:40:19.477
Go on.

1:40:22.564 --> 1:40:24.357
Your mom's waiting…

1:40:26.151 --> 1:40:27.569
Go on.

1:40:30.697 --> 1:40:34.075
You wanna end up like him?
Do you wanna die?

1:40:34.784 --> 1:40:36.202
Do you wanna die?

1:40:38.163 --> 1:40:41.041
Get the hell out of here! Get out!

1:40:41.207 --> 1:40:42.709
Go!

1:40:42.876 --> 1:40:44.586
Go!

1:44:37.902 --> 1:44:41.322
