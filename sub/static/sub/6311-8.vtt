00:02.698 --> 00:04.352
Previously onMom...

00:04.439 --> 00:06.397
You said you wanted to meet
my new girlfriend. Ta-da.

00:06.484 --> 00:07.398
Christy, Candace.
Candace, Christy.

00:07.485 --> 00:08.443
Nice to meet you.

00:08.530 --> 00:09.922
Oh, same here.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.750
You know, Baxter'’s told me

00:11.837 --> 00:13.709
all about how you'’ve turned
your life around.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.928
[chuckles]
Good for you.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.280
Candace bought me new clothes.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.977
Yeah, I noticed.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.761
No one'’s owned them before.

00:22.848 --> 00:25.373
I'’m the first person
to wear them.

00:25.460 --> 00:28.028
Christy, I hear you just
moved into a new apartment.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.117
Yeah, we'’re really
excited about it.

00:30.204 --> 00:31.814
I live in the closet.

00:34.251 --> 00:35.209
Hey, you made it.

00:35.296 --> 00:36.819
Can we go swimming?

00:36.906 --> 00:38.734
The pool is heated
and the spa'’s all toasty.

00:38.821 --> 00:39.952
Go put your suit on.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.171
[chuckles]

00:41.258 --> 00:42.520
Okay, sweetie.

00:42.607 --> 00:44.261
Love you! Bye!

00:44.348 --> 00:45.915
Candace fixed up the guest room.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.525
He'’s got his own TV,
video games.

00:47.612 --> 00:51.703
Ooh, and a closet
that he can use as a closet.

00:51.790 --> 00:54.054
[laughs]
That'’s a good one.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.533
Bye.

00:58.797 --> 01:01.278
[grunting, muttering]

01:01.365 --> 01:02.758
Merry Christmas, Mom.

01:02.845 --> 01:04.890
Oh, thank you, honey.

01:04.977 --> 01:07.023
I got you a perfume
that'’s a little less obvious.

01:08.677 --> 01:11.332
[laughs] Oh, where
does he get it?

01:13.203 --> 01:14.944
Yeah, well, I say that
to all the parents,

01:15.031 --> 01:16.641
and so few listen.

01:16.728 --> 01:18.339
Just so we'’re clear,
I am the parent.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.167
I may not listen,
but I am the parent.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.909
It'’s okay, Christy.

01:23.996 --> 01:26.564
We all know you'’re doing
the best that you can.

01:26.651 --> 01:30.090
Do not do the pity voice
with me.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.875
Oh, dear. Now you'’re upset.

01:35.051 --> 01:38.707
I am not upset,
you big red turd.

01:42.145 --> 01:44.104
Hey, Dad.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.757
Hey, buddy. Candace made
cookies; they'’re in the kitchen.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.019
Bye, Mom.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.543
Bye!

01:48.630 --> 01:50.806
He used to give me a hug.

01:50.893 --> 01:53.200
Yeah, he'’s at that age.
I wouldn'’t take it personally.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.288
CANDACE:
Look who'’s home.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.377
Ooh, what a big hug!

01:58.422 --> 02:01.033
Come on, he'’d hug a scorpion
if it had a cookie.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.948
He just did.

02:03.035 --> 02:04.602
See you later.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.430
See ya.

02:06.517 --> 02:08.039
CANDACE:
Oh. Christy? Wait.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.693
So close.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.609
Hey!

02:11.696 --> 02:12.784
You got a sec?

02:12.871 --> 02:14.264
Uh, sure. What'’s up?

02:14.351 --> 02:16.092
Well, I'’ve just been thinking,

02:16.179 --> 02:18.138
now that Baxter and I
are getting married,

02:18.225 --> 02:20.923
you and I are gonna be
in each other'’s lives a lot.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.665
Yeah, I think about that, too.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.145
Wouldn'’t it just be easier

02:25.232 --> 02:29.149
if new wife and...
old wife were friends?

02:29.236 --> 02:31.499
"Old wife." [chuckles]
Good start.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.414
How about I take you
to lunch tomorrow?

02:33.501 --> 02:35.155
Oh!

02:35.242 --> 02:37.157
[groans]

02:37.244 --> 02:42.205
That sounds super fun
and n-nutritious, uh...

02:42.292 --> 02:44.947
but, um, ugh, I have plans
with my mom tomorrow.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.818
Bring her. I love Bonnie.

02:46.905 --> 02:49.430
If we'’re gonna be friends,
you can'’t lie to me.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.910
[chuckles] 1:00 at
the Oak Ridge Country Club?

02:51.997 --> 02:53.042
Okay, uh, great.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.304
I will see you there.

02:54.391 --> 02:56.393
Yay! [chuckles] Mmm.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.962
Oh, there'’s the
hug Roscoe loves.

03:00.049 --> 03:01.964
♪

03:18.459 --> 03:20.200
How about this?

03:20.287 --> 03:21.984
[groans]
At a fancy country club?

03:22.071 --> 03:23.333
I don'’t think so.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.378
What'’s wrong with it?

03:24.465 --> 03:26.336
Makes me look poor.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.904
All right, then we should
stop looking in this closet.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.558
[groans]

03:30.645 --> 03:32.168
Candace couldn'’t
just take us to

03:32.255 --> 03:33.430
a nice restaurant
at the mall,

03:33.517 --> 03:35.127
she had to invite us to her club

03:35.215 --> 03:36.999
to remind us
how much money she'’s got.

03:37.086 --> 03:39.262
So why are you doing this?Why do you think? For Roscoe.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.264
You know, she'’s gonna be
in his life a long time.

03:41.351 --> 03:43.397
I got to figure out a way
to get along with her.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.877
Look at you,
taking the high road.

03:45.964 --> 03:48.097
Yeah, I just don'’t want
to look like a Sherpa

03:48.184 --> 03:49.316
while I'’m taking it.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.274
What are you gonna wear?

03:51.361 --> 03:54.538
I thought I'’d get something
from Neiman Marcus.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.236
How can you afford that?

03:56.323 --> 03:58.325
Leave the tag on,
return it the next day,

03:58.412 --> 04:00.240
making sure not to
sweat, spill or dribble.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.894
You'’re an evil genius.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.461
Let'’s go.

04:04.548 --> 04:05.984
Okay. We'’re gonna
need shoes, too.

04:06.071 --> 04:07.986
Ooh, how do we
return those?
Easy.

04:08.073 --> 04:11.251
Put nipple pasties on the soles
so they don'’t scuff.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.296
You really should start a blog.

04:13.383 --> 04:17.082
Unfortunately, we will
have to wear our own underwear.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.828
Ooh, I could get
used to this.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.352
Right?

04:25.439 --> 04:26.396
Tag check.

04:26.483 --> 04:27.484
Clear.

04:27.571 --> 04:28.920
Good to go.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.095
Hey, guys.

04:31.183 --> 04:33.098
Oop. Nip slip.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.929
Hi! You two look really nice.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.975
Oh, thank you.
So do you.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.716
Is that new?

04:41.803 --> 04:44.153
Oh, gosh, no. [chuckles]
When did I get this?

04:44.240 --> 04:46.242
When we went to the opera
in San Francisco.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.678
Oh, that'’s right.

04:47.765 --> 04:48.984
"Rigolotto." Rigoletto.

04:49.071 --> 04:50.290
We saw them both.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.250
Thanks for letting me join you.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.252
Oh, no. Thank you for coming.

04:56.339 --> 04:58.950
I have to tell you, Baxter is
sitting at home right now,

04:59.037 --> 05:02.214
out of his mind with worry that
the three of us won'’t get along.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.955
Why wouldn'’t we get along?

05:04.042 --> 05:06.088
That is exactly
what I said to him.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.656
Frankly, I think he'’s afraid
we'’ll gossip about him.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.527
[laughter]

05:10.614 --> 05:12.660
Like we don'’t have better things
to talk about.

05:12.747 --> 05:13.748
[laughter]

05:22.409 --> 05:26.543
So, Bonnie, what is it like to
manage an apartment building?

05:26.630 --> 05:28.502
Well, to be honest,
I don'’t think of it

05:28.589 --> 05:30.199
as managing a building,
I think of it

05:30.286 --> 05:32.027
as managing
a diverse community of people.

05:32.114 --> 05:34.159
Oh, that'’s a lovely thought.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.858
I'’m kidding. I'’m mostly killing
mice and unclogging toilets.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.163
So what'’s good here?

05:41.776 --> 05:44.039
Okay, okay, okay.
I am dying to ask.

05:44.126 --> 05:47.390
What is the deal with
Baxter and Q-tips?

05:47.477 --> 05:49.914
Oh, no. Is he still
leaving them on the sink?

05:50.001 --> 05:52.308
The sink, the bathtub,
the nightstand.

05:52.395 --> 05:55.920
The other day,
I found one in the refrigerator.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.835
Yeah, you got to go
easy on him with that.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.446
When he cleans his ears,

05:59.533 --> 06:01.273
it'’s like he goes
into a trance state.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.275
He doesn'’t even know
he'’s doing it.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.191
Remember when we took him to the
emergency room to get one out?

06:06.278 --> 06:09.630
Oh, God.
A Q-tip got stuck in his ear?

06:09.717 --> 06:10.892
You know what,
we'’re having lunch.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.067
Yeah, let'’s say ear.

06:12.154 --> 06:13.982
[laughter]

06:14.069 --> 06:15.897
Oh, well, you got to love him.

06:15.984 --> 06:18.029
Oh, no, yougot to love him.
I did my time.

06:18.116 --> 06:19.553
[laughter]

06:19.640 --> 06:21.816
Oh. This is so much fun.

06:21.903 --> 06:24.732
See, I knew if we made
the effort, we could get along.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.734
Absolutely.
There'’s a spa here, right?

06:26.821 --> 06:29.258
Oh, one of the best.Oh, yeah, we'’re getting along.

06:29.345 --> 06:31.042
Well, look who'’s here.

06:31.129 --> 06:33.262
Oh, hi, Daddy.Hey, Snickerdoodle.

06:33.349 --> 06:36.396
Uh, these are my friends,
Christy and Bonnie.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.093
Ah, nice to meet you.Nice to meet you.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.877
Fred Hayes.Hi. Christy.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.879
So how do you girls
know each other?

06:41.966 --> 06:44.926
Well, Christy actually
used to be married to Baxter.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.580
Really?

06:46.667 --> 06:48.277
And you'’re friends?

06:48.364 --> 06:50.714
I'’m as surprised as you are.

06:50.801 --> 06:51.933
[chuckles]

06:52.020 --> 06:53.587
And how about this lovely lady?

06:54.979 --> 06:56.285
Have you also slept with Baxter?

06:56.372 --> 06:59.506
I'’m her mother, and ew.

06:59.593 --> 07:03.945
You know, your ex is one of
my most popular employees.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.425
Mm. I'’m not surprised.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.948
He'’s a terrific guy.

07:07.035 --> 07:09.124
That and he sells killer weed.

07:09.211 --> 07:10.821
Daddy.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.476
Oh, lighten up.
He gives me a family discount.

07:13.563 --> 07:15.304
What? I never got a discount.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.175
Maybe that'’s because,
at our wedding,

07:17.262 --> 07:19.961
you introduced him to people
as my "first husband."

07:21.963 --> 07:24.313
You know, I'’m liking
Candace'’s new friends.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.836
Especially you.

07:29.361 --> 07:32.103
Oh. Thank you, I guess.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.323
So, Daddy...

07:34.410 --> 07:35.977
aren'’t you gonna go play golf?

07:36.064 --> 07:38.327
FRED:
No, I'’ve got plenty of time.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.807
So, Christy, do you play?

07:41.635 --> 07:42.766
Only if there'’s a windmill.
[chuckles]

07:44.072 --> 07:46.204
Don'’t have any of those.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.555
But we do have a waterfall
on the tenth hole.

07:48.642 --> 07:51.688
Would you like to see it?

07:51.775 --> 07:54.865
Um, I'’m not wearing
any sunblock.

07:54.952 --> 07:55.997
Hang on. I'’ve got some.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.128
No, no, Mom, I'’m fine.

07:57.215 --> 07:58.347
Close your eyes.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.438
Off you go.

08:05.659 --> 08:08.400
I understand
you ordering lava cake.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.229
I don'’t understand
how you got it on your ass.

08:11.316 --> 08:13.536
It'’s lava.

08:13.623 --> 08:16.844
Well, I don'’t see how we can
take it back to the store.

08:16.931 --> 08:18.846
I hope you have
a plan to pay for it.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.631
I do. You'’re gonna marry
Candace'’s dad.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.372
God, will you
stop it with that?!

08:23.459 --> 08:25.505
He just showed me
around the golf course.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.419
Yeah, and bought you a
putter in the pro shop.

08:27.507 --> 08:31.902
For old white guys, this is
as good as a promise ring.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.556
He only bought it
because I told him

08:33.643 --> 08:35.210
I always wanted
to learn to play golf,

08:35.297 --> 08:36.254
which isn'’t even true.

08:36.341 --> 08:37.865
So you started on a lie.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.996
All the best relationships
start that way.

08:40.083 --> 08:43.174
For the last time, I am not
going out with Candace'’s father.

08:43.260 --> 08:44.261
[doorbell rings]

08:44.349 --> 08:45.786
This dress cost $1,200.

08:45.873 --> 08:48.092
Yeah, you are.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.444
Delivery for
Christy Plunkett.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.446
It'’s happening! It'’s happening!
It'’s happening!

08:57.188 --> 08:59.321
Read the card. Read the card.
Read the card.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.105
Would you please calm down?

09:06.023 --> 09:07.895
[mouthing]

09:11.159 --> 09:13.553
[sighs] He wants to
have dinner with me.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.685
Thank you, Jesus!

09:17.034 --> 09:18.383
I'’m not having dinner with him.

09:18.470 --> 09:19.733
We'’re not?

09:19.820 --> 09:22.126
Mom, he'’s Candace'’s father.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.520
He'’s gonna be
Baxter'’s father-in-law

09:24.607 --> 09:26.130
and Roscoe'’s
step-grandfather.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.132
And he'’s got
five car dealerships,

09:28.219 --> 09:30.961
a full head of hair and when he
looks down he can see his belt.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.008
Doesn'’t matter.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.576
I'’m finally starting to get
along with Candace,

09:36.663 --> 09:39.143
and she is, like it or not,
a part of my son'’s life.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.581
What are you doing?I'’m calling Fred to tell him
I'’m not gonna

09:41.668 --> 09:43.626
go out with him.No, you'’re not.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.323
Give me the phone.Hear me out.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.760
I don'’t need to hear you out.

09:46.847 --> 09:47.891
Gimme.Yes,

09:47.978 --> 09:50.764
I get the Roscoe thing,

09:50.851 --> 09:53.114
but you deserve to be happy too.

09:53.201 --> 09:54.768
Now, think about it.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.508
You'’re pushing 40.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.988
[grunts]Yeah. How many rich guys

09:58.075 --> 09:59.599
in golf carts
are coming your way?

09:59.686 --> 10:01.165
[grunts]

10:01.252 --> 10:03.080
Oh, screw it.If you turn that man down,

10:03.167 --> 10:04.342
I swear I will disown you.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.214
Oh, no.
And lose all this?

10:07.868 --> 10:09.739
That'’s my point.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.918
Thank you.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.488
He sent another one?Yup.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.098
It'’s a 60-degree sand wedge.

10:21.185 --> 10:23.187
I think it helps you
get out of those little

10:23.274 --> 10:25.276
pretend beaches
they have there.

10:25.363 --> 10:27.322
How many is that?

10:27.409 --> 10:31.021
Looks like a whole set.

10:31.108 --> 10:33.154
This guy won'’t take no
for an answer.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.983
So how about we shave
those legs and say yes.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.985
Not gonna happen.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.682
[doorbell rings]What do you want to bet

10:39.769 --> 10:41.336
that'’s balls?

10:41.423 --> 10:43.860
Which you could use.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.209
Hello, Bonnie.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.950
Hey, Snickerdoodle, what'’s up?

10:48.604 --> 10:50.650
We seem to have
a bit of a situation.

10:50.737 --> 10:51.781
Is Roscoe okay?

10:51.868 --> 10:53.000
Oh, he'’s fine.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.479
Christy, can we speak privately?

10:54.566 --> 10:56.656
No. What'’s going on?

10:58.440 --> 11:00.529
I don'’t know what your game is,

11:00.616 --> 11:02.531
but I want you to stay away
from my father.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.534
I don'’t have a game.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.754
But she could
if she took some lessons.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.279
I know you'’re jealous of me.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.281
You'’ve always been
jealous of me.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.936
But I can live with that because
I was raised to be tolerant

11:16.023 --> 11:17.589
of those who are less fortunate.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.591
What I can'’t live
with is you trying

11:19.679 --> 11:22.725
to better yourself
by seducing my father.

11:22.812 --> 11:25.685
I didn'’t seduce anybody.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.295
I'’m only gonna say this once.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.645
Stay away from him.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.039
Once'’ll do it.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.997
It'’s ringing.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.698
Hi, Fred, it'’s Christy.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.136
I changed my mind.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.790
I would love
to have dinner with you.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.748
Really can'’t thank you enough.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.280
[sighs] I can'’t believe
we didn'’t go shopping

11:56.367 --> 11:58.848
for what is clearly the most
important date of our lives.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.981
It'’s not important.
I'’m just doing this

12:01.068 --> 12:02.547
to punish Candace--
it'’s one-and-done.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.288
That makes no sense.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.203
Fred seems like a great guy.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.683
I'’m sure he is.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.337
So after all the losers
we'’ve had,

12:09.424 --> 12:11.774
don'’t we deserve
a great guy?

12:11.861 --> 12:13.820
Stop saying "we."If you think

12:13.907 --> 12:16.561
you'’re getting out of here
without me, you'’re wrong, bucko.

12:16.648 --> 12:19.739
Let it go.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.784
Now, how do I look?

12:21.871 --> 12:23.830
Now I don'’t care.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.266
Cheer up, I shaved.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.702
Big whoop.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.225
[doorbell rings]Oh, that'’s him.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.186
Christy, wait.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.796
Let me just give
you one piece

12:33.883 --> 12:35.189
of motherly advice.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.975
If you think
you'’re punishing Candace

12:39.062 --> 12:40.498
by having dinner
with her father,

12:40.585 --> 12:42.500
just imagine how she'’d feel

12:42.587 --> 12:45.112
if you managed
to get pregnant tonight!

12:55.862 --> 12:57.254
Are you sure
this doesn'’t bother you?

12:57.341 --> 12:58.821
Oh, not at all.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.867
In fact, I hope
you get drunk

13:00.954 --> 13:02.782
so I can drive your
Ferrari out there.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.873
So, uh, let me see
if I understand this--

13:06.960 --> 13:09.484
you just woke up
one day and said,

13:09.571 --> 13:10.877
"I'’m never gonna drink again"?

13:10.964 --> 13:12.443
Yup.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.271
And then 11 years later
I quit drinking.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.882
[laughs]

13:15.969 --> 13:17.884
Well, whatever you did,
I'’m impressed

13:17.971 --> 13:19.581
with the way
you turned your life around.

13:19.668 --> 13:22.845
You should be.
I'’m a miracle.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.804
Yeah, you are.
Working two jobs,

13:24.891 --> 13:26.762
raising a child,
going to college.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.372
I can also make anything
for dinner as long as

13:28.459 --> 13:31.245
I have rice cakes,
mustard and American cheese.

13:32.942 --> 13:35.553
So, um, tell me about you.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.600
What'’s it like to
be Napa Valley'’s

13:38.687 --> 13:40.602
king of Korean cars?

13:40.689 --> 13:42.865
Oh, you saw the commercial.

13:42.952 --> 13:46.042
Not a lot of guys can
pull off a crown.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.175
To answer your question,

13:48.262 --> 13:50.699
it'’s good to be the king
of Korean cars.

13:50.786 --> 13:53.963
It'’s allowed me to be
the driver of Italian cars.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.184
How long have you
been doing it?

13:57.271 --> 13:59.055
Oh, let'’s see, uh...

13:59.142 --> 14:00.883
it'’s coming up on 40 years.

14:00.970 --> 14:04.713
Wow, that'’s longer
than I'’ve been...

14:04.800 --> 14:07.498
that'’s a long time.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.370
Nice save.

14:11.807 --> 14:14.157
Yeah, just so you know, uh,

14:14.244 --> 14:15.855
I'’m not in the habit
of going out

14:15.942 --> 14:17.291
with my daughter'’s friends.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.510
Oh, I'’m-I'’m not her friend.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.382
Good.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.997
I'’m sorry if I

14:28.084 --> 14:30.217
[clears throat] freaked you out
on that last turn.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.696
No, no, it'’s a Ferrari,

14:31.783 --> 14:34.438
it'’s meant to
be driven fast.

14:34.525 --> 14:37.485
But [clears throat]
not on two wheels.

14:37.572 --> 14:40.575
No, they give you four
for a reason.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.664
Well, um...

14:42.751 --> 14:44.753
we'’re here, so...

14:44.840 --> 14:47.582
Uh, thank you for
a lovely evening.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.453
Thank you.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.542
I... really had a good time.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.022
I'’m glad.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.589
When can I see you again?

14:56.199 --> 14:59.420
Well, uh,
that'’s a little tricky.

14:59.507 --> 15:02.771
You get how this situation
is complicated.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.729
I do.

15:07.123 --> 15:09.343
So how about tomorrow?

15:09.430 --> 15:11.214
Great. [chuckles]

15:12.520 --> 15:13.608
I'’ll bring a slower car.

15:15.697 --> 15:18.004
Good night.Good night.

15:18.091 --> 15:19.831
CROWD:
Let'’s go, Stanford!

15:19.919 --> 15:21.790
ANNOUNCER: As Jeran just facing
up Lampley a little hard

15:21.877 --> 15:24.010
off the back arm.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.318
Hey.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.496
Hey.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.977
So... aren'’t you curious?

15:35.064 --> 15:38.285
It'’s 10:00, all my questions
are answered.

15:38.372 --> 15:40.156
Okay.

15:40.243 --> 15:43.464
So I guess I won'’t tell you

15:43.551 --> 15:45.074
I really like him,

15:45.161 --> 15:47.381
and I'’m seeing him again
tomorrow night.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.211
Don'’t you be messing with me!

15:51.298 --> 15:53.604
I'’m not.
We had a great time.

15:53.691 --> 15:55.128
We did?We did!

15:55.215 --> 15:56.956
Did we make out?I wet my lips,

15:57.043 --> 15:58.522
but he was a perfect gentleman.

15:58.609 --> 16:01.134
Oh, baby, I'’m
so happy for us!

16:01.221 --> 16:03.136
[knocking]
Oh.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.138
Maybe the perfect gentleman came
back to bend you over the couch.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.709
Why are you ruining my life?

16:11.796 --> 16:14.234
What are you talking about?

16:14.321 --> 16:17.063
If you'’re doing this to make
Candace crazy, congratulations.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.065
She'’s crying, drinking
and screaming.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.328
It'’s like I'’m married
to you again.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.199
Really?

16:23.286 --> 16:24.940
Come on in and tell me
about all it.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.203
I'’ve never seen her like this.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.423
You have hit the button
of all buttons.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.773
The button that launches
all the missiles!

16:31.860 --> 16:34.515
I'’m-I'’m sorry,
that-that wasn'’t my intention.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.952
I mean, it was, but not now.

16:38.127 --> 16:40.216
I... really like Fred.

16:40.303 --> 16:43.741
And I intend to keep seeing him.

16:43.828 --> 16:47.223
All right, I was hoping
it wouldn'’t come to this,

16:47.310 --> 16:49.182
but you leave me no choice.

16:49.269 --> 16:50.574
What are you doing?

16:50.661 --> 16:51.836
I have a personal
checking account

16:51.923 --> 16:54.665
with $8,427 in it.

16:54.752 --> 16:56.972
If you agree to stop seeing
Fred, it'’s all yours.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.976
Minus the $25 I need
to keep the account open.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.240
You think you can buy me?

17:04.327 --> 17:05.633
That cheaply?

17:07.461 --> 17:10.420
Fine, take the 25 bucks!
I'’ll close the account.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.901
That'’s enough, Baxter.
You need to go.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.816
You don'’t understand--Good night, Baxter!

17:14.903 --> 17:16.383
I wouldn'’t do this to you--

17:16.470 --> 17:17.775
The missus
said good night!

17:19.516 --> 17:20.952
You believe that guy?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.824
Yeah, as if we
care about money.

17:30.527 --> 17:31.963
[doorbell rings]

17:37.969 --> 17:39.406
Roscoe ready?

17:40.711 --> 17:44.063
Roscoe, your mom'’s here.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.512
Any time, Roscoe!

17:59.687 --> 18:01.341
Hi, Mom.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.517
Hey, sweetie,
did you have fun this weekend?

18:03.604 --> 18:06.128
Yeah, Dad took me to the fair
and I got to drive a go-cart.

18:06.215 --> 18:07.521
Mm, cool.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.479
I got to drive a Ferrari.
