[IN MANDARIN] Jenny, come here.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.707
Motherwort for your focus,

00:40.774 --> 00:44.244
creeping lobelia for your vitality,

00:44.311 --> 00:47.614
and wolfberry for that
sweet wolfberry taste!!!

00:47.681 --> 00:51.365
Mommy, that one looks like the bad stuff

00:51.366 --> 00:53.086
the policeman showed us in class:

00:53.620 --> 00:55.222
marijuana.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.290
Mei Mei!

00:56.356 --> 00:58.191
Flee from marijuana.

00:58.525 --> 01:02.529
It saps your vigor and transforms
you into a skateboard vagrant!

01:02.763 --> 01:05.286
Grow up drug-free and proud

01:05.287 --> 01:07.634
like such female
Chinese-American role models

Jenny.

01:24.284 --> 01:25.852
Your mother is right.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.855
Marijuana has no benefits,

01:29.589 --> 01:31.044
unlike this meticulously
curated selection of plants,

01:31.045 --> 01:32.559
brambles, and forest litter.

01:33.226 --> 01:35.128
Jenny, I make you this vow:

01:35.529 --> 01:38.465
as long as I am alive, you will
never go lacking for this tea.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.701
Or the filtered water
required to bring it to life.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.472
And she still sends
you this tea every week?

01:45.605 --> 01:47.641
Yeah. Along with reassuring notes.

01:49.142 --> 01:51.244
"If you stop drinking
this, you will be a failure

01:51.311 --> 01:53.180

01:56.183 --> 01:58.585
You wanna try some?
It's got fresh wolfberry.

01:58.819 --> 01:59.886
I'll take a shot.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.860
Mm. Mm, mm.

or nothing.

07:34.187 --> 07:38.892
Behold, the paradox that
is Schrödinger's Pot.

07:39.960 --> 07:44.931
In this box is an eighth of
top-shelf cannabis and a vial of water

07:44.998 --> 07:48.969
<i>with a 50-percent chance of spilling,
rendering the pot unsmokeable.</i>

07:49.602 --> 07:52.105
Meaning that, according to
the laws of quantum mechanics,

07:52.172 --> 07:54.132
Schrödinger's Pot, as of this moment,

07:54.133 --> 07:57.077
both is and is not ready to fuck you up.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.879
But once you open the box,
quantum decoherence kicks in,

07:59.946 --> 08:01.982
and you'll have either
paradigm-shifting weed

08:02.048 --> 08:03.783
or a wet bag of worthless shit.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.000
No matter what, you'll get high

08:06.001 --> 08:07.654

your head around this

pretentious marketing
idea he came up with.

pot's not just for stupid people.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.314

09:09.149 --> 09:11.618
- F.
- Blank. I go first.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.820
- Nope, I go first.
- No, blank can be any letter.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.955
Yeah, I know, and I'm calling it Z.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.564
Let's get ready to Scrabble!

09:28.001 --> 09:29.803
Fare thee well, sweet rat...

09:30.336 --> 09:34.741
who we remember as a mother, a
grandmother, a great-grandmother,

09:35.842 --> 09:37.877
a great-great-grandmother...
You get the idea.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.317
Jesus, it smells like a joint
took a shit and smoked it.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.252
Hey, Douglas. Sorry about the smell.

09:48.253 --> 09:49.956
We found a dead rat in our water tank.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.691
Well, I'm not surprised.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.260
Yet another death by marijuana overdose.

09:56.362 --> 09:57.397
Where's Ruth?

09:57.764 --> 09:58.731
She's inside.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.301
- Do you want me to get her?
- No. [CHUCKLES] No.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.369
But you can get this.

10:04.003 --> 10:07.040
You can tell her that in response
to my complaint to the landlord,

10:07.107 --> 10:09.275
he referred me to his
property manager, Gary,

10:09.375 --> 10:12.245
with whom I will be meeting with
no later than next Wednesday,

10:12.312 --> 10:16.082
possibly sooner, depending
on Gary's availability.

10:18.084 --> 10:20.086
Okay. I'll let her know.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.122
Now get rid of that stink.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.257
Junkie hookers work back here, okay?

10:25.992 --> 10:28.828
You know, if the smell
gets into your dojang,

10:28.895 --> 10:32.866
I recommend a lemon-verbena candle.
I can bring one over if you like.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.901
Oh, yes!

10:35.368 --> 10:36.769
Oh, I would love that!

10:36.836 --> 10:39.806
Please come over with
a lemon-verbena candle.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.876
Why should I be suspicious
of anyone who works for Ruth

10:42.942 --> 10:46.312
and hangs around all day snurfing
darbs and vaping the reef?

10:48.414 --> 10:50.183
Okay, so I'll swing by on my break.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.719
Oh, fantastic. I can't wait to see you.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.891
- Probably 4, 4:30.
- Super!

11:08.034 --> 11:10.937
After strong opening
moves by Carter and Ruth,

11:11.371 --> 11:13.773
young Travis now finds himself alone,

11:14.207 --> 11:18.144
trembling in the harsh
glare of the pressure...

11:19.345 --> 11:21.314
and stuff.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.718
Can we lose the color commentary?

11:26.185 --> 11:28.922
You should be glad they're
covering women's sports at all.

11:35.762 --> 11:37.196
I'm serving y'all quinoa.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.868
Seventeen plus four
plus five, that is 26.

11:42.802 --> 11:45.004
You could've just put
the Q on the triple letter

11:45.071 --> 11:47.874
and made "qi" and "qi" for
65. What the... ? What the... ?

11:51.110 --> 11:53.813
Okay, whatever. "Quinoa"
is a cooler word.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.182
Oh? Quinoa's cool? Yeah.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.752
Over-cultivation displaced
millions of Peruvians.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.254
But what the fuck? It's cool.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.229
You should always
play "qi" when you can.

12:10.296 --> 12:13.232
I mean, it's like the
letter Q get a chance to say:

12:13.433 --> 12:18.871
"Hey, I don't need you,
U, 'cause I have I."

12:22.976 --> 12:25.745
Come on. That is
hilarious. That's something.

12:29.482 --> 12:34.854
It's sad to see doping have such a
negative effect on the game we love.

12:42.528 --> 12:45.298
- [OLIVIA] Hey, Jenny.
- How'd you know it was me?

12:46.032 --> 12:47.891
'Cause even from
inside this scummy tank,

12:47.892 --> 12:49.869
I can smell your
mother's stank-ass tea.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.339
- Would you like to try it?
- Think I'll pass.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.377
Are you sure? My mom claims it
promotes health, intelligence,

12:57.443 --> 12:59.212
and perfectly formed bowel movements.

13:00.179 --> 13:02.315
- And you believe that?
- I know one to be true.

13:03.549 --> 13:04.617
All right.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.921
Oh, God. What is in this again?

13:08.988 --> 13:12.291
Sorry, that information is only
given on a need-to-vomit basis.

13:12.992 --> 13:16.496
But I can tell you, my 90-year-old
great-grandma drinks it every day,

13:16.562 --> 13:19.098
and she criticizes me
like a woman half her age.

13:20.099 --> 13:21.100
That's kind of sweet.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.369
Speaking of your family,
