Remember when you asked
if we could stop it --

00:03.277 --> 00:05.043
all the evil
in the world --

00:05.045 --> 00:07.679
if we could
really change things.

00:09.083 --> 00:11.817
Maybe we can.

00:11.818 --> 00:13.051
We're going
to that place,

00:13.053 --> 00:15.220
and we're gonna
save Jack and Mom.

00:15.222 --> 00:17.589
Let's do this.

We could've been something.
I just need your power.

01:18.452 --> 01:19.985
If we do this,

01:19.987 --> 01:21.720
you're the engine,
but I'm behind the wheel.

Hello, Jamil.

02:47.174 --> 02:48.874
Who are you?

02:48.876 --> 02:51.576
Oh, we've never met.

02:51.578 --> 02:53.545
But you've read
all about me.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.616
How does it go?

03:12.466 --> 03:14.433
You're...God?

03:14.435 --> 03:17.135
Close, but...

03:17.137 --> 03:19.404
not quite.

03:19.406 --> 03:20.605
Gabriel?

03:20.607 --> 03:22.474
The other one.

03:22.476 --> 03:24.876
The better one.

03:24.878 --> 03:27.145
- Michael.
- There we go.

03:27.981 --> 03:29.948
No, no, no, no.

03:32.219 --> 03:34.953
Why are you here?

03:34.955 --> 03:37.255
Well, that is the question,
isn't it?

03:39.426 --> 03:42.094
Why are we here?

03:42.096 --> 03:44.429
I know why I'm here --

03:44.431 --> 03:46.798
to ask you a question.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.100
What question?

03:48.102 --> 03:50.035
The same question
I've spent weeks

03:50.037 --> 03:51.403
traveling
around this world

03:51.405 --> 03:54.740
asking all sorts
of people --

03:54.742 --> 03:57.476
holy men, leaders,

03:57.478 --> 03:59.244
killers.

03:59.246 --> 04:02.114
And now
I come to you,

04:02.116 --> 04:03.648
Jamil Hamed.

04:06.754 --> 04:08.520
What do you want?

04:10.624 --> 04:11.857
What?

04:11.859 --> 04:14.659
Do you want?
Exactly.

04:15.963 --> 04:18.163
If you could
have anything,

04:18.165 --> 04:19.630
name it.

04:22.636 --> 04:24.636
Peace.

04:24.638 --> 04:26.238
And love.

04:28.976 --> 04:31.843
If you cared
about peace,

04:31.845 --> 04:34.079
you never
would have left Syria.

04:34.081 --> 04:35.347
You never
would have ran

04:35.349 --> 04:37.149
and abandoned your friends
to die --

04:37.151 --> 04:38.683
and they did die.

04:38.685 --> 04:40.085
No.

04:40.087 --> 04:41.987
And if you
cared about love,

04:41.989 --> 04:44.556
you never would have gone into
that broom closet with...

04:45.692 --> 04:47.392
What was her name?

04:47.394 --> 04:49.161
No.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.862
Darlene?

04:52.433 --> 04:53.932
Your wife
never would have left,

04:53.934 --> 04:57.602
and you wouldn't be
living in this...rat hole.

04:58.739 --> 05:00.839
No!

05:05.312 --> 05:07.879
And that's the problem
with you.

05:07.881 --> 05:09.948
You're lost...

05:12.286 --> 05:14.085
...and not worth saving.

05:15.856 --> 05:17.989
Wha--Wha--What
do you want?

05:20.861 --> 05:22.561
What I have always
wanted...

05:26.500 --> 05:28.233
...a better world.

Devil's Trap.

in Dead Man's Blood.

A rawhead
did this?

Yeah.
Outside Phoenix.

06:10.410 --> 06:12.410
They're faster
than they look.

06:20.454 --> 06:22.754
Meaner, too.

06:22.756 --> 06:24.823
So, so gross.

06:26.293 --> 06:28.527
Soup's on. Who's eating?

06:28.529 --> 06:29.928
- Oh, I am.
- Right here.

06:29.930 --> 06:31.429
Yeah, I'll --

06:31.431 --> 06:32.831
Yeah, right here.

06:32.833 --> 06:34.666
- How 'bout you guys?
- I'll have soup.

06:37.738 --> 06:39.137
Sam.

06:39.139 --> 06:41.139
Hey, Mom.

06:41.141 --> 06:43.174
How was Atlanta?

06:43.176 --> 06:45.944
It was, uh --

06:45.946 --> 06:47.746
It was a bust.

06:47.748 --> 06:49.681
The woman who claims
she saw an “angel”...

06:51.251 --> 06:54.185
...was...

06:54.187 --> 06:56.054
Let's just say I think
she had one too many hits

06:56.056 --> 06:57.522
of the brown acid,
you know?

07:00.961 --> 07:03.128
Sam, we're gonna
find him.

07:03.130 --> 07:04.829
Ketch is working
that thing in London.

07:04.831 --> 07:06.498
Castiel
is in Detroit.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.234
I know it's been
three weeks since Dean...

07:14.541 --> 07:16.241
Something will break.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.244
It has to.

07:21.081 --> 07:23.315
Yeah. Yeah,
you keep saying that.

07:28.388 --> 07:30.522
Have you slept?

07:30.524 --> 07:33.191
At all?

07:33.193 --> 07:35.060
Sam, you need to rest.
Go and lay down.

07:35.062 --> 07:36.895
- Mom --
- Chief.

07:36.897 --> 07:37.963
Hey.

07:37.965 --> 07:40.198
Good to have
you back.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.500
Thanks.
Don't thank me yet.

07:42.502 --> 07:45.437
Word is we got some vamps
heading East on I-90.

07:45.439 --> 07:48.640
Gypsy types.
Pickin' off truckers mostly.

07:48.642 --> 07:51.109
Last body got drained and
dropped just outside La Crosse

07:51.111 --> 07:53.345
six hours ago.
Okay. Um...

07:53.347 --> 07:55.280
All right.
Get me teams of two.

07:55.282 --> 07:57.082
I want watch points
every 50 miles.

07:57.084 --> 07:59.718
If you see something,
say something.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.953
Maggie, can you hack
the traffic cams on the freeway?

08:03.023 --> 08:04.856
Um...

08:04.858 --> 08:06.224
no.

08:06.226 --> 08:08.493
Right. Right.

08:08.495 --> 08:10.762
Of course. Sorry.
Um, I got it.

08:10.764 --> 08:13.131
Thank you. Uh, please.

08:13.133 --> 08:14.666
Would you call in
Sharon and her crew?

08:14.668 --> 08:15.967
We're gonna need
all hands on deck here.

08:15.969 --> 08:17.636
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

08:22.809 --> 08:24.075
Sam --

08:24.077 --> 08:26.144
I'm good.

08:31.351 --> 08:32.984
I'm good. I am.

08:37.090 --> 08:38.857
Hey, how's Jack?

08:46.099 --> 08:48.500
Watch for that left.

08:48.502 --> 08:50.535
I never
had to fight before.

08:50.537 --> 08:52.871
Mm-hmm.
Life's a little different

08:52.873 --> 08:55.640
when you can't just
zap people around, huh?

08:57.377 --> 08:59.411
A lot different.
Yeah.

08:59.413 --> 09:01.813
You'll
get used to it.

09:01.815 --> 09:04.015
Truth be told,

09:04.017 --> 09:07.018
this stuff didn't come
all that easy for me, either.

09:07.020 --> 09:10.822
Had my ass handed to me
more times than I can count.

09:10.824 --> 09:12.490
But you kept fighting?

09:12.492 --> 09:14.092
You got to.

09:14.094 --> 09:17.128
As a wise man once said,
“It ain't how hard ya hit.

09:17.130 --> 09:20.098
It's how hard you can get hit
and keep moving forward”.

09:22.069 --> 09:24.769
Was that Gandhi?

09:24.771 --> 09:26.838
Probably.
Yeah, somethin' like that. Yeah.

09:28.542 --> 09:32.010
So, what are you
gonna do?

09:33.346 --> 09:34.813
Watch the left.

09:34.815 --> 09:36.414
Attaboy. Attaboy.

09:39.853 --> 09:41.486
Ah, that's it.

09:58.205 --> 10:00.038
Castiel, darling.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.175
Oh, God.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.813
Sweetie, fix me
a coffee, black,

10:08.815 --> 10:10.849
and a Texas Trinity,
necked,

10:10.851 --> 10:13.017
with some bark.

10:13.019 --> 10:14.886
Sure.

10:14.888 --> 10:17.655
And for my friend...

10:17.657 --> 10:19.824
Water.

10:19.826 --> 10:22.293
- Water.
- All right.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.202
What did you
just order?

10:31.204 --> 10:32.370
Oh, sausage and brisket,

10:32.372 --> 10:34.906
pork ribs, no sauce,
well done.

10:34.908 --> 10:37.408
My apologies for the lingo,
but when in Rome...

10:38.745 --> 10:40.612
I was surprised you wanted
to meet here.

10:40.614 --> 10:42.914
I'm surprised you wanted
to meet at all.

10:42.916 --> 10:46.317
Didn't think that you
consorted with...

10:46.319 --> 10:48.486
my kind.

10:51.558 --> 10:54.225
Yes, well...

10:54.227 --> 10:55.593
I need information.

10:55.595 --> 10:56.961
Of course, you do.

10:56.963 --> 10:59.164
Does any demon

10:59.166 --> 11:01.800
know where
Dean Winchester is?

11:01.802 --> 11:03.935
I'm sorry, did you just say that
you lost a Winchester?

11:03.937 --> 11:07.272
Because, one --
that's...interesting.

11:07.274 --> 11:09.007
And, two, how is it
that you lost Dean?

11:09.009 --> 11:10.809
I thought the two of you
were joined at the...

11:11.878 --> 11:14.045
...you know,
everything.

11:14.047 --> 11:16.247
Thank you, darling.

11:16.249 --> 11:18.082
Just answer
the question.

11:19.719 --> 11:21.619
You see,

11:21.621 --> 11:24.389
I could...

11:27.627 --> 11:31.262
...except,
not to be crass,

11:31.264 --> 11:34.299
but what's in it
for <i>moi?</i>

11:34.301 --> 11:35.900
Your life.

11:35.902 --> 11:37.702
Come again?

11:37.704 --> 11:39.504
I'll speak slower...
Mm.

11:39.506 --> 11:42.240
...and you will tell me
everything you know,

11:42.242 --> 11:46.444
or I will burn you
to ash

11:46.446 --> 11:49.447
right here
and right now.

11:49.449 --> 11:51.482
I think
we can do better.

11:52.986 --> 11:54.619
“We”?

12:06.533 --> 12:07.699
We.

12:46.704 --> 12:48.371
You saved me,
Sister.

12:48.373 --> 12:50.573
Thank you.
God bless you.

12:50.575 --> 12:52.675
He does,
every day.

13:05.790 --> 13:07.356
Hey, Jo.

13:13.131 --> 13:13.898
Who are you?

13:13.922 --> 13:15.922
You don't recognize me
with this pretty face?

13:16.701 --> 13:18.434
You're not --

13:18.436 --> 13:20.102
You're not
Dean Winchester.

13:20.104 --> 13:21.537
You're...

13:21.539 --> 13:24.340
Oh, God.

13:24.342 --> 13:26.209
People keep
calling me that.

13:27.011 --> 13:28.311
Ah, ah.

13:31.950 --> 13:33.916
We need to talk.

13:33.918 --> 13:36.752
You're the Archangel Michael,
from another world,

13:36.754 --> 13:38.788
and you're possessing
Dean Winchester.

13:40.758 --> 13:42.992
Sounds more complicated
than it is.

13:46.064 --> 13:48.497
Why would he
say “yes” to you?

13:48.499 --> 13:50.399
Love.

13:50.401 --> 13:52.602
Really?

13:52.604 --> 13:55.137
That's very
Hallmark Channel.

13:55.139 --> 13:56.539
So, I'm just
gonna go now.

13:56.541 --> 13:58.307
No, you're not.

14:00.378 --> 14:02.712
Not until I ask you...

14:08.019 --> 14:09.652
...what do you want?

14:12.857 --> 14:14.357
I don't know.

14:14.359 --> 14:17.927
Chanel, Dior,
Louis Vuitton.

14:17.929 --> 14:20.196
You think
this is a joke?

14:21.666 --> 14:24.300
I don't know
what this is.

14:24.302 --> 14:27.169
You asked,
I answered.

14:27.171 --> 14:28.738
We done?

14:28.740 --> 14:29.839
No.

14:29.841 --> 14:32.341
I asked,
and you lied.

14:33.144 --> 14:35.678
I didn't.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.114
I know
about you, Jo.

14:38.116 --> 14:41.083
Because <i>he</i> knew
about you.

14:41.085 --> 14:42.151
You're the rebel,

14:42.153 --> 14:44.353
the angel
who doesn't like

14:44.355 --> 14:47.723
playing by Heaven's rules
or whatever.

14:47.725 --> 14:51.060
You pretend to care
about these things --

14:51.062 --> 14:53.029
pretty things.

14:54.232 --> 14:56.732
But that's all it is --

14:56.734 --> 14:58.200
pretending.

14:58.202 --> 15:00.770
These trinkets,

15:00.772 --> 15:02.638
they don't make you happy.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.874
They just
pass the time.

15:04.876 --> 15:07.376
They're not
what you really want.

15:09.314 --> 15:12.548
And if you're so smart,
what do I really want?

15:12.550 --> 15:13.883
Love.

15:13.885 --> 15:17.219
To belong,
to have a place --

15:17.221 --> 15:19.755
a home, a family.

15:19.757 --> 15:22.191
It's very...

15:22.193 --> 15:25.695
very human of you.

15:25.697 --> 15:27.630
And so...

15:29.400 --> 15:31.233
...so disappointing.

15:32.904 --> 15:37.540
I can sense how many angels
are in this world.

15:37.542 --> 15:40.443
There aren't many left.

15:40.445 --> 15:42.578
I thought...

15:42.580 --> 15:44.847
maybe I could help.

15:44.849 --> 15:47.049
But if they're all these

15:47.051 --> 15:51.988
sad, lost,
fallen things --

15:51.990 --> 15:53.356
things like you --

15:53.358 --> 15:55.758
maybe they're not
worth saving, either.

16:05.136 --> 16:06.602
Hey.

16:08.272 --> 16:09.672
Hey.

16:11.075 --> 16:12.475
I, uh...

16:14.012 --> 16:15.845
...chatted
with Bobby.

16:22.053 --> 16:25.187
He said you may have
had a rough day today.

16:25.189 --> 16:27.156
It was fine.

16:27.158 --> 16:28.357
Okay.

16:30.962 --> 16:32.395
Jack...

16:34.132 --> 16:37.433
...I know this must be
so hard.

16:37.435 --> 16:39.402
Without your grace,

16:39.404 --> 16:41.670
without your powers,

16:41.672 --> 16:45.074
it's a lot, I'm sure.

16:45.076 --> 16:48.811
But you can get past this.
I know you will.

16:48.813 --> 16:50.846
I have faith
in you, Jack.

16:50.848 --> 16:52.982
And I believe in you.

16:52.984 --> 16:54.717
And --

16:54.719 --> 16:57.153
Hey.

16:57.155 --> 17:00.189
Sam, um,
he's awake.

17:08.031 --> 17:09.397
I have to, uh --

17:09.400 --> 17:10.733
I know.

17:13.570 --> 17:15.471
We'll talk later,
all right?

17:34.492 --> 17:37.326
Did he say anything?

17:37.328 --> 17:39.528
I didn't talk
to him.

17:39.530 --> 17:41.997
I can barely
look at him.

17:43.835 --> 17:46.035
Thanks.

18:23.074 --> 18:25.274
Oh, hey, Sam.

18:25.276 --> 18:27.343
Hey...

18:27.345 --> 18:28.777
Nick.

18:28.779 --> 18:30.679
<i>Nick...</i>

18:30.681 --> 18:32.248
<i>Nick...</i>

18:34.685 --> 18:36.185
<i>I'm an angel.</i>

18:36.187 --> 18:37.953
<i>My name is Lucifer.</i>

18:37.955 --> 18:41.624
<i>I need to take control</i>
<i>of your mind and your body.</i>

18:41.626 --> 18:43.826
<i>Nick, I need you</i>
<i>to say yes.</i>

18:43.828 --> 18:45.861
Then yes.

18:48.432 --> 18:51.233
How'd you sleep?

18:51.235 --> 18:53.869
Uh, yeah. Um...

18:53.871 --> 18:56.105
Okay. I didn't
wake up screaming,

18:56.107 --> 18:57.606
so that's a plus.

18:57.608 --> 18:59.608
Yeah.

18:59.610 --> 19:01.143
So, no more nightmares?

19:02.313 --> 19:04.280
They're getting better.

19:06.284 --> 19:07.950
Good.

19:11.489 --> 19:13.656
May I, uh --
May I see it?

19:29.607 --> 19:32.308
Oh, look at that.

19:32.310 --> 19:33.642
Looks like
it's healing.

19:35.213 --> 19:37.813
Yeah, it itches a lot.
Doesn't really, uh,

19:37.815 --> 19:40.082
hurt! Aah!

19:40.084 --> 19:41.116
Sorry.

19:41.118 --> 19:44.353
Ow.

19:46.691 --> 19:48.757
Ow.

19:51.462 --> 19:53.796
I don't get it.

19:53.798 --> 19:55.998
I don't understand
how Lucifer could die

19:56.000 --> 19:57.566
and I could live.

19:57.568 --> 19:59.368
Yeah, um...

19:59.370 --> 20:02.504
I think that maybe it's
because the archangel blades

20:02.506 --> 20:04.573
were made to kill
the archangel inside

20:04.575 --> 20:06.508
a-and not the person
they, uh --

20:06.510 --> 20:09.845
Possesses and uses to almost
end the world twice?

20:11.048 --> 20:12.681
Yeah. That.

20:15.019 --> 20:17.886
It must be weird, you looking
at me and seeing him.

20:19.223 --> 20:21.857
Yeah.

20:21.859 --> 20:24.093
But...

20:24.095 --> 20:26.762
I'm really glad
it's you.

20:26.764 --> 20:28.731
I'm glad
Lucifer is dead.

20:30.568 --> 20:32.234
Me, too.

20:33.571 --> 20:35.704
You still, uh --

20:35.706 --> 20:37.539
Y-You still remember --

20:37.541 --> 20:40.843
Oh, I mean, just little bits
and pieces here and there.

20:40.845 --> 20:44.046
Nothing -- Nothing
about your brother.

20:44.048 --> 20:45.481
Okay.

20:47.218 --> 20:49.118
And, uh, Michael?

20:49.120 --> 20:52.688
Did he tell Lucifer
anything?

20:52.690 --> 20:55.291
Anything
about his plan?

20:56.694 --> 21:00.062
I mean,
I remember him saying

21:00.064 --> 21:03.899
he wanted to do it right
this time.

21:16.881 --> 21:19.081
- Hey, Cass.
<i>- Hello, Sam.</i>

21:20.951 --> 21:22.318
<i>Who is this?</i>

21:22.320 --> 21:23.552
Oh.

21:23.554 --> 21:26.989
I'm the boy
who's got your angel.

21:29.327 --> 21:30.592
And if you want
to see him again,

21:30.594 --> 21:33.395
you know, alive,

21:33.397 --> 21:35.297
we should
probably chat.

21:46.521 --> 21:48.087
It's a trap.

21:48.089 --> 21:50.423
Yep.

21:51.526 --> 21:54.326
- This guy's a --
- Demon.

21:54.328 --> 21:56.862
He just told you
he was a demon?

21:58.066 --> 21:59.432
Yeah.

21:59.434 --> 22:01.200
He seemed pretty proud
of it, too.

22:01.202 --> 22:04.070
Yeah, they ain't
a real humble bunch.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.072
So, what do we do?

22:10.111 --> 22:11.877
We get Cass back.

22:14.282 --> 22:17.483
All right, grab holy water,
Devil's Trap bullets,

22:17.485 --> 22:19.919
angel blades, because whatever
we're walking into --

22:19.921 --> 22:21.754
It's gonna suck.

22:21.756 --> 22:23.255
Exactly.

22:25.008 --> 22:27.008
Maggie,
you're with Bobby.

22:27.010 --> 22:28.476
Mom, you're with me.

22:31.848 --> 22:33.314
I'm coming, too.

22:34.918 --> 22:37.385
I know I'm not as strong
as I used to be,

22:37.387 --> 22:39.354
but I can help.

22:43.159 --> 22:46.027
I have to.

22:46.029 --> 22:47.295
Listen, kid --

22:47.297 --> 22:48.696
Okay.

22:49.499 --> 22:51.232
Grab your gear.

22:54.070 --> 22:56.771
Sam, I mean --

22:56.773 --> 22:58.506
Jack's a worker,
but he ain't ready

22:58.508 --> 23:00.575
for a full-on
demon smackdown.

23:00.577 --> 23:02.210
So...

23:02.212 --> 23:03.778
we keep
an eye on him.

23:07.584 --> 23:09.817
He needs this, Bobby.

23:18.294 --> 23:20.528
And <i>danke,</i>
sweetie.

23:20.530 --> 23:24.098
Castiel, you sure I can't
get you anything hot

23:24.100 --> 23:26.434
and black?

23:26.436 --> 23:28.669
Coffee has
no effect on me.

23:28.671 --> 23:30.505
Hm.

23:30.507 --> 23:32.173
Me either.

23:33.643 --> 23:36.344
You know,
not anymore,

23:36.346 --> 23:39.414
but it's like
saltwater taffy

23:39.416 --> 23:41.449
or infants -- you know,
I just like the taste.

23:41.451 --> 23:43.217
Why are you
doing this?

23:43.219 --> 23:45.052
I'm just trying
to be a good host

23:45.054 --> 23:46.220
like Mother
would have wanted.

23:46.222 --> 23:48.089
No, w--

23:49.225 --> 23:52.326
Why are you using me as bait?

23:56.499 --> 23:59.000
I mean, it's kind of what
you're <i>for,</i> isn't it?

24:04.107 --> 24:06.808
And I need something

24:06.810 --> 24:08.910
from Sam Winchester.

24:10.780 --> 24:13.481
You really think that he's
gonna make a deal with you?

24:13.483 --> 24:15.349
Oh, he's dealt with worse.

24:17.086 --> 24:20.855
You see, recently,
I had a revelation.

24:20.857 --> 24:29.096
You know, somebody asked me
what it was

24:29.098 --> 24:30.932
as a demon
walking the planet,

24:30.934 --> 24:32.834
destroying,
drinking, defiling --

24:32.836 --> 24:36.537
you know,
the Three D's --

24:36.539 --> 24:38.206
I didn't know.

24:38.208 --> 24:42.710
So, I sat back,
and I gave it a good think,

24:42.712 --> 24:47.248
and I realized
exactly what I wanted.

24:50.687 --> 24:53.621
And what is it?

24:53.623 --> 24:55.556
Everything.

25:07.370 --> 25:10.004
Sam, it's gonna be fine.

25:12.408 --> 25:14.242
Stop saying that,
please.

25:14.244 --> 25:16.544
What?

25:16.546 --> 25:19.280
“It's gonna be fine,” that
everything's gonna be fine,

25:19.282 --> 25:21.215
we're gonna
find Dean, and --

25:21.217 --> 25:23.184
We are.
You don't know that.

25:26.289 --> 25:29.557
Dean's gone, and we have
no idea where he is

25:29.559 --> 25:33.060
or -- or if he's
even still alive.

25:33.062 --> 25:35.096
You know,
Michael could have...

25:35.098 --> 25:38.266
burned him out
or worse, and...

25:41.170 --> 25:43.371
I know.

25:44.674 --> 25:47.208
I know he's out there,

25:47.210 --> 25:49.076
scared and alone.

25:51.047 --> 25:52.914
I know.

25:54.417 --> 25:56.450
I know he might
never come back.

25:58.988 --> 26:02.056
Never think
I don't know that.

26:02.058 --> 26:04.258
But I can't...

26:06.296 --> 26:08.996
I have to think
about the good, Sam,

26:08.998 --> 26:11.799
because, if I don't,
I will drown in the bad.

26:13.169 --> 26:14.902
For Dean's sake,

26:14.904 --> 26:16.571
I can't do that.

26:19.008 --> 26:21.475
We can't do that.

26:33.756 --> 26:36.824
Listen, Jack.
On the other side,

26:36.826 --> 26:40.227
you saved me and mine
a dozen times.

26:40.229 --> 26:42.063
Now, things
may have changed,

26:42.065 --> 26:44.065
but whatever happened --

26:44.067 --> 26:46.601
whatever <i>happens --</i>

26:46.603 --> 26:48.436
we got your back.

27:21.137 --> 27:24.038
Here.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.507
The Demon Killing Knife.

27:26.509 --> 27:28.542
Are you sure?

27:28.544 --> 27:30.711
Yeah.
They'll search me.

27:30.713 --> 27:32.647
It's safer with you.

27:32.649 --> 27:34.782
All right.

27:34.784 --> 27:36.250
You know what to do.

27:55.872 --> 27:57.772
Ladies and gentlemen,

27:57.774 --> 28:01.475
the great
Sam Winchester.

28:11.821 --> 28:16.323
I have heard
so much about you.

28:16.325 --> 28:18.726
You are
a damn legend, Sam --

28:18.728 --> 28:20.294
a-an icon.

28:20.296 --> 28:22.697
Th-The shoulders,
the -- the hair.

28:22.699 --> 28:25.700
Mm-mm!

28:25.702 --> 28:28.102
You are my Beyoncé.

28:28.104 --> 28:30.371
Cass, you okay?

28:30.373 --> 28:31.806
Of course he is.

28:31.808 --> 28:34.408
I don't damage
the merchandise.

28:36.012 --> 28:39.547
I'm more embarrassed
than I am hurt.

28:39.549 --> 28:41.082
And you are?

28:41.084 --> 28:42.483
Kipling.

28:42.485 --> 28:45.252
Uh, “Kip” for short.

28:46.589 --> 28:48.656
Cool. Kip.

28:48.658 --> 28:51.759
I'm here
like you asked, so...

28:51.761 --> 28:54.662
Yeah, you're here,
but not exactly as I asked.

28:54.664 --> 28:58.632
You see, I told you
to come alone.

28:58.634 --> 29:00.034
But...

29:01.604 --> 29:03.971
Found them outside.

29:03.973 --> 29:06.707
They didn't even
put up a fight.

29:07.143 --> 29:08.542
I'm sorry, Sam.

29:15.351 --> 29:18.119
It's fine. You tried.

29:18.121 --> 29:20.621
But I'm gonna need
a little bit more now,

29:20.623 --> 29:22.223
you know, not to...

29:22.225 --> 29:24.492
eat them.

29:24.494 --> 29:26.594
I-It's just, you know,
late capitalism.

29:26.596 --> 29:28.062
You understand.

29:30.032 --> 29:32.600
So, Sam,

29:32.602 --> 29:33.934
let's make a deal.

29:39.684 --> 29:41.584
You're looking
to make a deal?

29:41.586 --> 29:44.653
I'm a demon.
That's how we do.

29:49.093 --> 29:50.626
Please.

29:55.900 --> 29:57.566
Sit.

29:59.871 --> 30:01.904
No?

30:01.906 --> 30:05.207
Suit yourself,
barbarian.

30:06.044 --> 30:07.710
What do you want?

30:07.712 --> 30:10.246
That is a very good question.
What do I want?

30:10.248 --> 30:13.549
You know, I don't know if
you're aware or not, Sam,

30:13.551 --> 30:16.252
but Hell's in a bit
of a pickle,

30:16.254 --> 30:19.021
you know, with Crowley dead
and Asmodeus Kentucky fried,

30:19.023 --> 30:20.322
which means --
- I don't care.

30:20.324 --> 30:21.924
Yes, you do.

30:24.395 --> 30:26.629
Or you will.

30:26.631 --> 30:29.999
You see, for the first time
in a very long time,

30:30.001 --> 30:32.234
Hell is without a King.

30:32.236 --> 30:35.271
And that --
that's just not right.

30:35.273 --> 30:37.173
- So, I --
- So, you volunteer.

30:39.043 --> 30:41.243
Exactly.

30:41.245 --> 30:42.812
Why are you
telling me all this?

30:42.814 --> 30:46.549
Because I want to work
with you, Sam,

30:46.551 --> 30:48.350
not against you.

30:48.352 --> 30:50.119
And is that why
you took me hostage?

30:50.121 --> 30:52.788
It's exactly why
you're still breathing.

30:52.790 --> 30:55.591
It gives me a chance to show
Sam and friends

30:55.593 --> 30:57.960
that I can hurt them...

30:58.930 --> 31:00.996
...but choose not to.

31:00.998 --> 31:03.966
You see, I want
the Crowley Deal.

31:03.968 --> 31:05.501
I give you
information,

31:05.503 --> 31:07.970
a spot of help
every now and again,

31:07.972 --> 31:11.807
and in return, you choose
to turn a blind eye

31:11.809 --> 31:13.042
to the crossroads deals,

31:13.044 --> 31:16.045
the demon-on-demon violence,
et cetera.

31:16.047 --> 31:18.047
We never gave Crowley
that deal.

31:18.049 --> 31:19.415
How exciting.

31:19.417 --> 31:22.284
Then I would be
breaking new ground.

31:22.286 --> 31:23.719
All right.

31:23.721 --> 31:26.655
You got some good lines,
I'll give you that much,

31:26.657 --> 31:28.491
but you're no Crowley.

31:28.493 --> 31:30.926
I know that.
And so do they.

31:36.100 --> 31:37.700
Ouch!

31:39.170 --> 31:41.237
Owie!

31:42.707 --> 31:46.041
I know
that I'm not that

31:46.043 --> 31:49.145
ponce-y
son of a bitch.

31:49.147 --> 31:51.413
You see, in life,

31:51.415 --> 31:54.683
I rode with Genghis Khan,
and I burned half the world.

31:54.685 --> 31:56.452
So, <i>please,</i>

31:56.454 --> 32:01.257
do you think that I like
prancing around like this?

32:01.259 --> 32:02.825
Please.

32:02.827 --> 32:04.193
If I had it my way,

32:04.195 --> 32:07.463
I would eat
your heart.

32:14.739 --> 32:17.873
But a King
has an image to maintain.

32:17.875 --> 32:20.142
And I'm not
afraid of you.

32:21.846 --> 32:23.479
But...

32:23.481 --> 32:25.114
they are.

32:27.418 --> 32:29.285
So, take
the deal, Sam,

32:29.287 --> 32:33.556
before I stop
trying to be Crowley

32:33.558 --> 32:36.225
and I show you
who I really am.

32:39.030 --> 32:41.230
So, what do you say,
darling?

32:50.541 --> 32:52.241
No.

32:54.845 --> 32:57.880
A-Are you sure,
because I know things --

32:57.882 --> 33:01.350
a-all sorts of things.
- Yeah.

33:02.453 --> 33:04.153
So do I.

33:04.655 --> 33:06.155
Like?

33:31.983 --> 33:33.282
Sam!

33:39.223 --> 33:40.723
How smart.

34:02.413 --> 34:05.180
Hey. Stay low.

34:12.623 --> 34:15.357
Hey!

34:15.359 --> 34:17.192
Get away from him.

34:18.429 --> 34:20.228
Aw, balls.

34:29.572 --> 34:31.507
Take this.
You know how to use it?

34:31.509 --> 34:33.708
Uh, stab them
with the pointy end?

34:33.710 --> 34:35.610
- Pretty much. Okay.
- Okay.

35:29.066 --> 35:31.800
Cool.

35:42.046 --> 35:43.645
Enough!

35:45.750 --> 35:49.551
There will be
no new King of Hell.

35:53.557 --> 35:56.058
Not today.

35:56.060 --> 35:58.427
Not ever.

36:00.431 --> 36:04.366
And if anybody
wants the job,

36:04.368 --> 36:07.336
you can come through me.

36:07.338 --> 36:10.172
Understood?

36:10.174 --> 36:11.907
So, what's it gonna be?

36:35.499 --> 36:37.166
That's what I thought.

36:39.526 --> 36:42.061
Yeah.

36:42.063 --> 36:44.930
Yeah, yeah. I --
No, I don't care. I --

36:44.932 --> 36:46.765
Just keep looking.

36:46.767 --> 36:48.934
Yeah. Thanks.

36:48.936 --> 36:51.537
Who was that?

36:51.539 --> 36:54.006
Uh, Ketch.

36:55.543 --> 36:57.143
He's in London

36:57.145 --> 37:01.914
searching for the Newton-Dee
Hyperbolic Pulse Generator.

37:01.916 --> 37:03.616
The what?

37:03.618 --> 37:05.117
It's the --
It's the magic egg

37:05.119 --> 37:06.685
that kicked Lucifer
out of the President.

37:06.687 --> 37:08.654
I thought we could use it
on Michael, but

37:08.656 --> 37:10.122
Ketch can't find it.

37:10.124 --> 37:12.992
So, that's another dead end,
which is just awesome.

37:17.331 --> 37:19.798
Sam, are you all right?

37:19.800 --> 37:22.201
Yeah,
I've been better.

37:22.203 --> 37:25.004
I've been worse.

37:25.006 --> 37:26.805
You?

37:28.442 --> 37:29.808
I'm -- I'm just sorry.

37:29.810 --> 37:31.877
I should never have gone
to those demons.

37:31.879 --> 37:32.945
Cass, I --

37:32.947 --> 37:35.314
No, I-I-I don't blame you.
I...

37:37.885 --> 37:39.652
Honestly, I-I

37:39.654 --> 37:42.054
wish I'd have thought
of it first.

37:42.056 --> 37:44.857
If it meant
finding Dean, I-I'd...

37:44.859 --> 37:46.759
work with...

37:48.629 --> 37:51.297
I'd do anything.

37:58.573 --> 38:00.306
Not bad today, old man.

38:00.308 --> 38:01.740
You, too, sunshine.

38:10.751 --> 38:13.552
- Hey, Jack.
- I'm fine.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.427
You did well.

38:21.429 --> 38:24.230
All I did
was get punched...

38:24.232 --> 38:26.098
in the face.

38:26.100 --> 38:29.068
Well, to be fair, we all
got punched in the face.

38:29.070 --> 38:32.037
That's not -- Before,
when I had my powers,

38:32.039 --> 38:34.073
I-I could
have done something, and --

38:34.075 --> 38:36.342
Jack.

38:36.344 --> 38:39.278
You don't -- You --
You don't have your powers.

38:39.280 --> 38:41.947
And you --

38:41.949 --> 38:44.550
Your grace should
regenerate in time,

38:44.552 --> 38:45.751
but until then --

38:45.753 --> 38:48.320
I'm useless.

38:48.322 --> 38:50.956
I can't kill demons,
I can't find Dean,

38:50.958 --> 38:52.825
and Michael
is in our world,

38:52.827 --> 38:54.460
and I can't stop him.

38:55.596 --> 38:58.130
I can't do anything.

38:58.132 --> 39:02.067
I don't have anything.

39:03.104 --> 39:05.871
Oh, Jack,

39:05.873 --> 39:07.806
that's just not true.

39:09.110 --> 39:12.378
You've got me.

39:12.380 --> 39:14.280
You have all of us.

39:16.550 --> 39:19.184
You have your family.

39:25.026 --> 39:28.894
And -- And we are
going to find Dean

39:28.896 --> 39:30.362
and we are going
to beat Michael

39:30.364 --> 39:32.264
and we're going
to do it together.

39:32.266 --> 39:33.999
We --

39:36.203 --> 39:37.903
Because
that's what we do.

40:16.010 --> 40:17.009
Hello?

40:17.011 --> 40:19.044
<i>Sam?</i>

40:19.046 --> 40:20.446
Jo?

40:21.749 --> 40:23.482
Yeah.

40:23.484 --> 40:24.616
We have a problem.

40:29.824 --> 40:32.224
Now, you --

40:32.226 --> 40:35.361
you know
exactly what you want.

40:37.631 --> 40:40.999
You don't pretend
to want to help people...

40:41.001 --> 40:43.802
or save the world.

40:43.804 --> 40:47.706
Your want
is pure and simple...

40:47.708 --> 40:50.142
and clean.

40:50.144 --> 40:52.978
And that's why you
are worth saving.

40:52.980 --> 40:56.749
That's why we are going
to work so well together.

40:58.052 --> 41:00.753
Because you --

41:00.755 --> 41:02.621
you just want to eat.
