Stop! I'm a police officer!

02:54.920 --> 02:56.910
Are you all right?

02:57.460 --> 02:59.590
I need my inhaler.

Oh, God. In my bag.

Thank you, love. God bless.

03:27.160 --> 03:30.270
Did you get a good look at him?
I need to take a statement.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.310
No, no, I don't need the fuss.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.750
There was only a couple
of quid in me purse.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.790
Madam, I need to report this.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.840
Madam?

03:40.360 --> 03:43.710
She's young. Looks late teens.

03:43.760 --> 03:45.750
Strangled?

03:45.800 --> 03:49.080
I haven't moved her yet, but
there's a cord round her neck.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.750
Drag marks on the concrete.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.790
Scuffing on the back of her boots.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.440
Maybe not killed here.
Maybe dragged and dumped.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.270
I'm guessing not many
people come down here.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.510
- Who called it in?
- Male, anonymous.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.100
From a phone box on the estate.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.640
It's not a cord. It looks like underwear.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.030
Get these people out of here!

04:25.080 --> 04:29.000
Move back, please! Move along.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.390
Where's Clay?

04:35.440 --> 04:37.440
Twice in three days.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.150
You in love?

04:41.200 --> 04:43.640
You got a message?

04:46.600 --> 04:49.340
I'm reconsidering our arrangement.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.310
Tell him I'm looking for him.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.880
Come on. In there.

05:37.040 --> 05:42.110
You turn up for duty late. Looking
like you've just been wrestling a pig.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.950
You're supposed to be making up
for last week's traffic screw-up

05:45.000 --> 05:48.590
so I have something positive to write
in your first probationary report.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.910
I was trying to help an old
lady. I've written a few details.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.230
- Um... I've not --
- Tennison,

05:54.280 --> 05:57.520
get your backside into Comms
and help Morgan out. Now.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.030
- Golf Hotel, 5-2.
- (Sorry, mate.)

06:05.080 --> 06:08.910
- 5-2 received, over.
- Reported break-in at 14 Bishop's Fields.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.950
Can you attend, over?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.990
5-2 received. We'll proceed. Over.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.110
Thank you, 5-2. Over.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.870
There's been a murder. I put the call out.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.550
Body found on the Kingsmead. Young woman.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.540
Horrible business.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.870
- Sorry, say again, sir.
- Golf Hotel to 3-19.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.310
22 Darnley Road. A Mrs Amos
alleging husband assaulted her.

06:30.360 --> 06:33.200
- Can you deal? Over.
- Yes. Over.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.550
I've not been around a murder case before.

06:37.600 --> 06:41.710
It's all hands on deck. Half the
station's down at the Kingsmead estate.

06:41.760 --> 06:45.080
One of you, two teas and biscuits
to DI Bradfield's office.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.590
Golf Hotel to 5-9.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.840
Maybe clean yourself
up while you're at it.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.270
Yeah, reports of suspicious activity.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.480
Morning, Jane.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.760
Ta, love.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.310
I want Uniforms knocking on doors.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.350
Someone knows who she is.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.910
Right. Ah, Tennison.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.950
'Bout bloody time!

07:26.000 --> 07:29.190
Four quid still in her pocket,
so I'm ruling out robbery.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.440
The note's been sent
to the lab for prints.

07:33.840 --> 07:37.540
We need a name for our
girl. That's our priority.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.150
DS Lawrence noticed track
marks on her arms. Old ones.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.750
- Addict?
- Former, by the looks of it.

07:44.800 --> 07:49.190
- I'll start with Drug Dependency Unit. See
if they know her. - How was she killed?

07:49.240 --> 07:52.870
WPC Tennison, you're
testing my patience today.

07:52.920 --> 07:57.150
It's all right. If you must
know, the victim was strangled.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.200
With her own bra.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.540
- That'll be all.
- Yes, Sergeant.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.310
- Tennison.
- Am I in trouble again, sarge?

08:14.360 --> 08:19.230
Not yet. I need you to join CID for the
house-to-house on the Kingsmead and Pembridge estates.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.590
Has she done any foot patrol there before?

08:21.640 --> 08:24.630
You worried they'll eat her
alive? Posh sort like her?

08:24.680 --> 08:27.870
- No, I didn't mean --
- I'm sure I'll be able to handle it, sir.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.390
She's sure she'll be
able to handle it, sir.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.980
Five minutes, front of station.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.350
Right, D section lads,
you're on the Kingsmead here.

08:45.400 --> 08:49.510

want you on the Pembridge over there.

said he recognised our girl.

11:07.140 --> 11:10.640
Said she used to hang out
at the Greyhound pub.

11:11.620 --> 11:14.890
Staff reckon from the description
she was an out-patient.

11:14.940 --> 11:18.170
Julie-Ann Collins. Last known
address, Kingsmead estate.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.220

11:42.260 --> 11:44.250
Looks like Julie.

11:44.300 --> 11:48.090
- Why? - It was her body
that we found this morning.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.370
- What is it?
- She's been murdered.

11:50.420 --> 11:52.410
Oh, no.

11:52.460 --> 11:54.450

11:54.500 --> 11:56.490
Not for a couple of weeks.

11:56.540 --> 11:59.290
- She used to work this patch?
- Now and then.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.330
How about any bother?

12:01.380 --> 12:04.610
Any creeps giving her a hard time?

12:04.660 --> 12:06.650
What about a pimp?

12:06.700 --> 12:08.700
I don't know.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.930
She used to hang out with this fella.

12:11.980 --> 12:15.570
That druggie? No, they
just scored together.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.610
Told me she was sweet on him.

12:20.300 --> 12:23.090
- Madam?!
- Be nice, Suzy.

12:23.140 --> 12:27.810
Never know his name. White,
brown hair, had a bad leg.

12:27.860 --> 12:31.650
Oh, yeah. He broke it. She mentioned that.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.970
Think that's why she felt sorry for him.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.010
Thanks, girls.

What were you saying, eh?

14:55.260 --> 14:57.250
You were high?

14:57.300 --> 14:59.290
When I turned my ankle.

14:59.340 --> 15:02.530
You told us about your broken ankle,
Eddie. That's not what I'm asking.

15:02.580 --> 15:06.890
Girls like Julie-Ann have someone looking
after them. A pimp. Was that you?

15:06.940 --> 15:08.930

15:15.020 --> 15:17.020
Who's Oz?

15:19.140 --> 15:21.610
Julie, is she going to be OK?

15:28.340 --> 15:32.730
How do you feel about your girlfriend
shagging other people for money?

15:32.780 --> 15:34.770
I hate it.

15:34.820 --> 15:39.290
It's me that took her to the hospital to
try and get her clean. I tried to help her.

15:39.340 --> 15:41.680
Yeah, you're a real saint.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.850

15:44.900 --> 15:48.530

there was three of you.

15:57.860 --> 16:00.660
Billy, you... Who was the other one?

16:01.580 --> 16:05.420
I can't think. I'm really tired.
I don't know what's going on.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.130
Give him time to come
down. We'll try him again.

16:10.180 --> 16:12.970
May 1st, Eddie takes
Julie-Ann to the hospital.

16:13.020 --> 16:16.210
He claims he hasn't seen her
since. That was two weeks ago.

16:16.260 --> 16:20.010
Morgan, this Suzy, she claims
Eddie and Julie-Ann were lovebirds.

16:20.060 --> 16:22.850
- They got high together.
- Maybe they had an arrangement.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.970
- Blow for blow-jobs.
- What a romantic.

16:25.020 --> 16:30.170
Sir, prints from the phone kiosk
on the Kingsmead, they don't match
Eddie Phillips or Billy Myers.

Latest was last year, July,
reported by George Collins.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.090
She was 17. Jesus!

16:38.140 --> 16:41.530
Address, 48 Church Mount Road.
George Collins, next of kin?

16:41.580 --> 16:43.580
We're checking, sir.

16:54.820 --> 16:57.530
I need a uniform presence
for a next of kin visit.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.570
I haven't done one of those yet.

16:59.620 --> 17:01.610
Can you find me another plonk, then?

17:01.660 --> 17:03.650
No, I didn't mean...

17:03.700 --> 17:05.700
I'll do it.

17:14.300 --> 17:17.609
- Continue straight on, sir.
- You can take your finger off.

17:17.660 --> 17:19.930
We're out of traffic now.

17:24.660 --> 17:28.050
Can I ask, sir, when we get there,

17:28.099 --> 17:30.090
I know what your role is.

17:30.140 --> 17:33.610
But um... Once we're
inside, if the mother cries,

17:33.660 --> 17:35.650
do I comfort her?

17:35.700 --> 17:37.700
How would I do that?

17:39.260 --> 17:41.370
Sorry if I'm asking too many questions.

17:41.420 --> 17:43.420
No, um... Just...

17:44.860 --> 17:46.850
Just do what feels natural.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.840
Grab that envelope from the back seat.

17:55.780 --> 17:57.890
You want me to show this to the family?

17:57.940 --> 18:03.140
No. When I give you the nod, just compare it
with any family photographs you see. Be discreet.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.690
So what part of London are you from?

18:07.740 --> 18:09.740
Maida Vale, sir.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.690
What brings a Maida
Vale girl to the police?

18:13.740 --> 18:17.090
I thought the force could do
with more posh sorts, sir.

18:20.780 --> 18:22.780
Fair enough.

18:28.300 --> 18:31.010
You shouldn't apologise
for asking questions.

18:31.060 --> 18:34.180
It's the only way you're going
to become a better copper.

19:08.820 --> 19:10.810
Mr George Collins?

19:10.860 --> 19:12.850
- Yes.
- Good evening.

19:12.900 --> 19:16.620
I'm Detective Inspector Leonard
Bradfield. This is WPC Tennison.

19:17.780 --> 19:20.520
Would you mind if we come in, sir?

19:21.580 --> 19:23.580
Um... Of course.

19:29.540 --> 19:31.850
Do you have a daughter named Julie-Ann?

19:31.900 --> 19:34.100
Is she in trouble again?

19:39.460 --> 19:44.530
I'm very sorry to tell you that... a girl we
believe to be your daughter has been found dead.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.570
What?

19:46.620 --> 19:51.490
The body of a young female was found earlier
today on the Kingsmead estate in Hackney.

19:51.540 --> 19:54.480
We are treating it as a murder enquiry.

19:55.020 --> 19:58.500
We need someone to formally
identify her as soon as possible.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.540
So you can't be sure that it is her.

20:03.820 --> 20:07.220
Not until she's formally
identified, sir, no.

21:06.940 --> 21:08.930
What's this about?

21:08.980 --> 21:11.330
I've got an alternative proposal.

21:11.380 --> 21:13.690
It may take a few weeks to put in place.

21:13.740 --> 21:17.060
But there's a bookie's on the
King's Road I'm looking into.

21:18.980 --> 21:22.540
No, we're doing the bank.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.450
One of my boys bumped into your wife.

21:33.140 --> 21:35.410
She put up quite a fight.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.960
You bother me again...

21:40.580 --> 21:43.120
.. next time, I'll send two in.

21:54.660 --> 21:56.650
When did you last see her?

21:56.700 --> 21:59.140
Oh... Not for a while.

22:01.220 --> 22:03.210
Over a year ago.

22:04.460 --> 22:06.260
I tried to help.

22:06.940 --> 22:11.060
She wouldn't listen. Ran away so
often, we stopped reporting it.

22:12.660 --> 22:15.820
Just... hoped she'd come back.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.780
Like other parents' kids do.

23:05.140 --> 23:07.140
Mr Collins?

23:12.420 --> 23:14.410
Yes, it's her.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.460
That's Julie-Ann.

23:31.940 --> 23:35.130
It's all right, Mr Collins.
It's all right. I've got you.

23:41.020 --> 23:45.340
It isn't our fault. We loved her,
gave her anything she wanted.

23:48.780 --> 23:50.780
She rejected us.

24:07.900 --> 24:12.540
'Names which turned out were taken from
the spy novels written by their boss.

24:15.140 --> 24:17.140
Hi, Mum.

24:20.060 --> 24:22.050
Have you been at work all this time?

24:22.100 --> 24:24.100
Yes.

24:26.580 --> 24:28.580
Hi.

24:37.260 --> 24:40.960
Why are you so late? Your
mum's been worried sick.

24:43.060 --> 24:45.050
A girl was murdered.

24:45.100 --> 24:49.170
I went on the bereavement visit, and
the DI sent me on the house-to-house.

24:49.220 --> 24:51.220
On your own?

24:53.220 --> 24:55.220
Should have called.

24:59.380 --> 25:01.380
Mum, can you knock?

25:11.860 --> 25:14.650
Haven't even looked at
your bridesmaid's dress.

25:14.700 --> 25:17.040
Later. I need to read this.

25:21.460 --> 25:24.660
I found these in your
dressing gown pocket.

25:30.140 --> 25:32.130
I didn't know you were on the Pill.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.730
Mum, it's 1973.

25:34.780 --> 25:36.770
It's not a big deal.

25:36.820 --> 25:38.810
Your sister's not on the Pill.

25:38.860 --> 25:40.850
(For fuck's sake.)

25:40.900 --> 25:42.900
Jane...

25:48.140 --> 25:51.100
See, this... This is why I worry.

25:53.620 --> 25:57.100
You come home late and you're moody.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.130
And you're effing and jeffing!

26:01.180 --> 26:04.180
I'll try to curb the effing and jeffing.

26:06.940 --> 26:09.410
Look at Pam. She's happy.

26:09.460 --> 26:13.370
So would I be if all I had to care
about was shampoo and clippers.

26:13.420 --> 26:15.420
And a wedding.

26:19.140 --> 26:21.540
How can that make you happy?

26:22.820 --> 26:24.810
Because it matters.

26:24.860 --> 26:27.810
When we find the person
that killed that girl,

26:27.860 --> 26:29.860
it will matter.

26:32.020 --> 26:34.020
We!

26:41.340 --> 26:43.330
Morning, Kath!

26:43.380 --> 26:45.370
- You off home?
- No.

26:45.420 --> 26:49.570
Remember the old folk's house in Bishop's
Fields that kept getting burgled?

26:49.620 --> 26:53.810
A bloke's been spotted. The sergeant
doesn't want him being spooked by uniform.

26:53.860 --> 26:57.210
- So he's sending me and Edwards from CID.
- As an undercover couple?

26:57.260 --> 26:59.250
- Are you going to hold hands?
- Shut up!

26:59.300 --> 27:01.890
Oi! Get out of here, you pervs!

27:01.940 --> 27:04.480
Stop doing your hair. Let's go.

27:05.980 --> 27:08.250
- Gordon Bennett!
- Yeah, Gordon Bennett.

27:08.300 --> 27:10.290
Yeah, Gordon Bennett.

27:10.340 --> 27:13.650
Your first PM already? You're
putting yourself out there.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.690
Am I?

27:15.740 --> 27:19.210
If you need some tips, maybe
we could grab a drink later.

27:19.260 --> 27:21.890
Oh. No, no, I'll be fine. Thanks.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.940
All right.

27:41.620 --> 27:44.490
We need the floor plans for the bank.

27:45.300 --> 27:48.040
Look like you've just seen a ghost.

27:52.020 --> 27:55.010
What are you depressing
yourself with that crap for?

27:55.060 --> 27:57.220
She was pretty.

27:58.540 --> 28:00.530
Yeah.

28:00.580 --> 28:02.580
Yeah.

28:12.340 --> 28:14.330
Know what you got to do?

28:14.380 --> 28:16.370
Yeah.

28:16.420 --> 28:18.490
Just forget about her now, all right?

28:18.540 --> 28:21.740
I'll drop you off, then
meet you back home.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.720
Stick to looking at page three.

28:39.900 --> 28:42.370
All right, you can go in now.

28:46.820 --> 28:48.820
How's my boy?

28:50.460 --> 28:52.660
Oh, nice to see you too.

28:55.180 --> 28:57.170
Look at the state of you.

28:57.220 --> 28:59.210
Eyes all bloodshot.

28:59.260 --> 29:01.250
You smoking that crap again?

29:01.300 --> 29:03.290
Mum got mugged.

29:03.340 --> 29:05.330
Is she OK?

29:05.380 --> 29:08.490
Man who done it said it was
a message from Clay Whiteley.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.740
We're all in danger now.

29:11.940 --> 29:13.930
It was a misunderstanding.

29:13.980 --> 29:15.970
Your old man sorted it.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.010
John wants the plans.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.940
I'll tell him tomorrow.

29:23.500 --> 29:27.620
Shoes. Get your shoes
off, give them to him. Now!

29:29.060 --> 29:32.050
Be careful with my stuff.
That wig's made to measure.

29:32.100 --> 29:36.570
Which makes it the only thing we found
in your flat which is definitely yours.

29:36.620 --> 29:39.410
Nice jacket. You been
nicking in Carnaby Street?

29:39.460 --> 29:41.130
I know my rights. I --

29:41.180 --> 29:43.180
Agh!

29:44.140 --> 29:46.330
Now you're sober, you can tell us more.

29:46.380 --> 29:48.980
I... I swear, I didn't do it.

29:51.180 --> 29:55.170
- You took her to the drugs unit in
Homerton hospital. - Who told you that?

29:55.220 --> 29:57.220
You did, you moron.

30:05.660 --> 30:08.850
Last time I saw her, she wanted
to get onto the methadone.

30:08.900 --> 30:12.410
- But then something happened and
she panicked. - What happened?

30:12.460 --> 30:15.330
She left. Somebody picked
her up. I don't know who.

30:15.380 --> 30:17.370
Did you see her get into a car?

30:17.420 --> 30:19.090
Yeah.

30:19.140 --> 30:20.570
A red one.

30:20.620 --> 30:23.410
Oh, well, we'll keep our
eyes peeled for a red car!

30:23.460 --> 30:25.860
What sort of red car, Eddie?

30:28.540 --> 30:30.530
A Jag. A Jaguar.

30:30.580 --> 30:33.580
A red Jag, but you don't know the driver.

30:39.380 --> 30:42.890
Night before last, you
kipped over at your nan's.

30:42.940 --> 30:44.930
Nancy Phillips.

30:44.980 --> 30:48.290
- Yeah. - I bet she knows everything
that goes on in your estate.

30:48.340 --> 30:50.370
Worth us asking her about Julie-Ann?

30:50.420 --> 30:54.220
Leave her out of this. She's
old. She's got angina.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.300
Did you kill her?

31:02.140 --> 31:04.890
Who would want Julie-Ann dead, Eddie?

31:04.940 --> 31:06.930
Think.

31:09.020 --> 31:11.160
Shit, he's gonna puke!

31:12.140 --> 31:14.880
Not on my shoes, you little shite!

31:20.580 --> 31:22.580
Call an ambulance!

31:23.460 --> 31:25.650
I knew something weren't quite right.

31:25.700 --> 31:29.210
See this bit of net curtain hanging
out the bottom of the window.

31:29.260 --> 31:31.890
I look in and there he is. Little scrote.

31:31.940 --> 31:33.930
Tries to leg it. But I'm on him.

31:33.980 --> 31:35.980
I'm out the back...

31:36.980 --> 31:39.130
Oi! Stop claiming my arrest!

31:39.180 --> 31:43.090
While you were doing all that, I was
tackling the suspect to the ground!

31:43.140 --> 31:45.130
Ha ha!

31:45.180 --> 31:48.450
- Edwards, get that locked away
in the property store. - Sir.

31:48.500 --> 31:51.610
Right, Eddie Phillips has given us a lead.

31:51.660 --> 31:56.170
He spotted a red Jaguar pick up Julie-Ann
from Homerton hospital on May the 1st.

31:56.220 --> 31:58.360
I want it found pronto.

32:03.360 --> 32:06.510
- On our way. Over. - Morgan,
Tennison, get into the guv's office.

32:06.560 --> 32:11.110
Eddie Phillips just puked everywhere and
it needs cleaning up. Open a window as well.

32:11.160 --> 32:15.460
- The sarge wants my arrest report.
- Just get on with it.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.320
Sorry.

32:19.400 --> 32:22.000
Tennison, post mortem. Let's go.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.140
Looks like I'm on vomit duty, then!

32:35.600 --> 32:37.590
- Nervous?
- A bit.

32:37.640 --> 32:40.030
Nothing like being thrown in the deep end.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.750
- Strangled prostitute.
- Don't put it like that.

32:42.800 --> 32:46.400
You met her parents. She
was someone's daughter.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.550
Morning, Paul.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.590
Hello, there.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.030
We didn't find anything else at the scene.

32:57.080 --> 32:59.190
Just the money that was in her pocket.

32:59.240 --> 33:03.310
And a cheap beaded bracelet
on her right wrist.

33:03.360 --> 33:05.910
These are her white socks, and boots.

33:05.960 --> 33:10.350
We did find some red carpet
fibre on the soles of her socks.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.830
And also some on the inside of her boots.

33:12.880 --> 33:17.270
DS Lawrence, I presume you're
doing exhibits and photographs.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.310
Mm.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.350
For the paperwork, you are?

33:21.400 --> 33:25.710
Probationary WPC 517G Tennison
attached to B Relief, Hackney, sir.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.520
Just name and number will suffice.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.190
This gruff sod's Professor Dean Martin.

33:32.240 --> 33:34.230
Spare me the Rat Pack jokes.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.280
Right, gather round.

33:40.120 --> 33:43.400
- No, thank you. I don't smoke.
- It helps block out the smell.

33:48.240 --> 33:51.680
Try not to drop fag ash on my
instruments tray, DI Bradfield.

33:53.440 --> 33:57.270
From the hypostasis and rigor
examined on the body at the scene,

33:57.320 --> 34:00.470
I'd estimate she was killed
between 6PM and midnight

34:00.520 --> 34:02.510
on Sunday the 13th of May.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.550
Cause of death, strangulation?

34:04.600 --> 34:08.110
The knot on the bra was tied
so tight, I had to cut it.

34:08.159 --> 34:11.230
And the killer ripped it off
her? Tied it round her neck?

34:11.280 --> 34:13.110
- Possibly.
- Excuse me.

34:13.159 --> 34:15.750
If you need to vomit, the
toilets are that way.

34:15.800 --> 34:20.750
The bra is strapless, so it might
not have been removed forcibly.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.739
Maybe she took it off beneath her top.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.080
Fair point.

34:27.880 --> 34:32.750
Extensive blue and yellow bruising
down the length of the right arm.

34:32.800 --> 34:36.310
Caused by severe blunt-force trauma.

34:36.360 --> 34:39.100
Can we turn the body over, please?

34:50.040 --> 34:53.830
Little lady took an extensive beating
to the buttocks and the back.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.949
At the time of death?

34:58.720 --> 35:00.710
No, it's older.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.350
See the difference
between the bruising here

35:03.400 --> 35:05.510
and the more recent marks on the neck?

35:05.560 --> 35:08.070
I'd estimate ten days old.

35:08.120 --> 35:11.350
- What caused them?
- A narrow instrument with a round edge.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.390
The amount of overlapping injuries

35:14.440 --> 35:17.840
suggest whoever inflicted
them was in a rage.

35:18.920 --> 35:20.910
WPC Tennison,

35:20.960 --> 35:23.500
would you mind crouching down?

35:25.120 --> 35:27.190
Side on, foetal position, facing me.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.230
Raise your right hand.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.390
Palm upwards, as if you were
trying to protect your head.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.430
Perfect.

35:34.480 --> 35:37.680
She was struck repeatedly
on the lower arm.

35:38.280 --> 35:41.470
And then beaten repeatedly
on the buttocks and the back.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.520
She fell and lay prostrate on the floor.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.600
He didn't mean for you to
actually do that bit, Tennison.

35:56.040 --> 36:00.030
Right, let's proceed to the fainting part.

36:00.080 --> 36:03.020
Gentlemen, roll her back over, please.

36:12.960 --> 36:15.830
Let's start the internal examination.

37:16.400 --> 37:20.790
This may be another reason your
victim wanted to get off the drugs.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.310
A dead foetus in the uterus.

37:23.360 --> 37:26.870
The child might have died at
the same time as the mother.

37:26.920 --> 37:29.860
Or as a result of the previous beating.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.870
From the size and development,

37:32.920 --> 37:35.060
it's very early stages.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.760
I'd estimate six to eight weeks.

37:44.240 --> 37:49.360
♪ No sun will shine in my day today

37:50.880 --> 37:52.880
♪ No sun will shine

37:54.080 --> 37:59.670
♪ That high yellow moon
won't come out to play

37:59.720 --> 38:02.110
♪ Won't come out to play

38:02.160 --> 38:07.680
♪ I said darkness has
come and covered my light

38:09.440 --> 38:13.630
♪ And has changed my day into night, yeah

38:13.680 --> 38:16.960
♪ Where is the love -- ♪

38:18.840 --> 38:21.950
Davey, what have I said about
smoking that stuff in here?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.950
It's raining and the
damp makes my legs worse.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.790
Then why were you out in
it the night before last?

38:27.840 --> 38:31.480
- I wasn't. - Your jacket
was hanging over the bath.

38:32.800 --> 38:35.070
I was here all night, Ma.

38:36.720 --> 38:39.920
Whoever she is, she's
not worth the bother.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.320
Leave it, Ma.

38:55.040 --> 38:58.430
I need you to write up a PM report
on what the professor told us.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.470
Yes, sir.

39:00.520 --> 39:03.600
You did well, Tennison. That
was one of the worst ones.

39:05.480 --> 39:09.270
- I've explained, madam.
- I've been standing here half-hour already!

39:09.320 --> 39:11.310
Now who is in charge?

39:11.360 --> 39:13.350
Oi!

39:13.400 --> 39:15.390
You've put my grandson in hospital.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.950
- Can I help, madam?
- Eddie Phillips.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.870
He ain't got nothing to do
with that tart's murder.

39:20.920 --> 39:24.110
- He told you that, did he?
- She got my Eddie beaten up.

39:24.160 --> 39:28.030
She's covered in bruises. You've
got that fight the wrong way round.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.870
Couple of months back,
he borrowed money for her.

39:30.920 --> 39:33.310
- What? - Yeah. But he
couldn't pay it back.

39:33.360 --> 39:36.670
So some thug come and done a
number on him. He smashed his leg.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.710
What you gonna do about that?

39:38.760 --> 39:40.750
He didn't tell us any of that.

39:40.800 --> 39:44.190
The night before last, was
Eddie at yours the whole time?

39:44.240 --> 39:48.000
Yeah, he was. I think he was asleep
all the time I was at the bingo.

39:51.720 --> 39:54.820
Oi! Don't you just leave me standing here!

39:55.760 --> 40:00.550
So he lied about his alibi. And someone broke
his leg when he told us he fell off a wall!

40:00.600 --> 40:03.310
If he lied about that,
what else did he lie about?

40:03.360 --> 40:05.900
We've got to bring him back in.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.390
Eddie Phillips has absconded.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.940
I want all units out there
looking for him now.

40:43.880 --> 40:45.870
Bugger.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.920
Thank you. Over.

40:49.480 --> 40:53.380
Before you go home, pin
these to the incident board.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.510
Why do you smell of Dettol?

40:55.560 --> 40:57.560
I was at the mort...

40:58.640 --> 41:00.640
Mortuary.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.270
- We're looking for Eddie Phillips!
- Check upstairs.

41:22.320 --> 41:24.320
Eddie Phillips!

41:27.880 --> 41:29.880
Nothing down here.

41:35.040 --> 41:37.040
- Anything?
- No.

42:01.020 --> 42:03.030
He said 'Not in those trousers!'

42:03.080 --> 42:05.070
Hello, Suzy.

42:05.120 --> 42:08.390
I'm not sure you should be out
working. It's not safe, love.

42:08.440 --> 42:10.430
Love now, is it?

42:10.480 --> 42:12.950
We're looking for Julie-Ann's boyfriend.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.500
- Have you seen him around
here recently? - No.

42:16.560 --> 42:19.550
What was Julie-Ann's
relationship with Eddie like?

42:19.600 --> 42:21.590
I didn't know him.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.950
- Was he violent? - Have you
prepared a long list of questions?

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Piss off, love.

42:28.320 --> 42:30.390
Sorry I bothered you.

42:37.880 --> 42:42.750
It makes me sick to my stomach that
that bastard is out there somewhere

42:42.800 --> 42:46.390
breathing, eating, living, while
Julie-Ann is in the mortuary

42:46.440 --> 42:49.440
being prodded and poked and sliced open.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Help me help her.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.480
Makes me sick too.

43:06.920 --> 43:09.670
Not from round here, are you?

43:09.720 --> 43:11.710
No.

43:11.760 --> 43:14.520
She didn't belong here neither.

43:15.880 --> 43:17.870
She wanted out.

43:17.920 --> 43:19.910
That bastard Eddie had her trapped.

43:19.960 --> 43:22.360
I don't want to say no more.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.990
Eddie!

43:49.040 --> 43:51.550
Mr Collins.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.800
I think we need to talk.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.870
How do you know about Eddie?

44:11.920 --> 44:15.120
The newspaper describes him
as Julie-Ann's boyfriend.

44:16.080 --> 44:18.070
There's blood here and here.

44:18.120 --> 44:20.830
I don't know what's going
on in that head of yours.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.910
But don't fuck this one up for us, David.

44:22.960 --> 44:25.550
This is a murder investigation.
She was 17, for God's sake.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.670
Next time, I'll take more
than just your wife's purse.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.710
I admire you.

44:30.760 --> 44:32.750
Be careful, Jane.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.800
Nothing happened.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.670
Why do you keep using my first name?

44:37.720 --> 44:39.560
You think I'm guilty?
