00:11.679 --> 00:12.714
Ah!

00:13.681 --> 00:15.797
(LAUGHS) Whoo!

00:16.601 --> 00:17.590
(GRUNTS)

00:18.603 --> 00:19.763
What do you want to do next?

00:20.062 --> 00:21.051
Uh...

00:21.189 --> 00:22.224

00:23.566 --> 00:26.433
Okay. Crawl tube?

00:27.195 --> 00:28.184
Nah.
Nah?

00:29.071 --> 00:32.438
Well,
I think we're running out
of options, honey.

00:32.575 --> 00:34.531
I want to go on the
merry-go-round.

00:34.619 --> 00:36.280
The... Again?

00:36.746 --> 00:38.907
But this time
all by myself.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.864
Oh... (LAUGHS)

00:42.251 --> 00:43.707
I don't know, jelly bean.

00:43.794 --> 00:46.786
Daddy, l'm six.
I'm not a baby anymore.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.217
Please?

00:54.805 --> 00:56.136
Thank you.

00:56.641 --> 00:57.972
You ready?
Uh-huh.

00:58.601 --> 01:00.387
All right. Come here.

01:01.145 --> 01:02.760
I'll take Beary.

01:05.149 --> 01:07.731
Now, you promise
you're not going to
tell Mommy, right?

01:07.818 --> 01:09.228
She'll kick my butt
if she finds out.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.810
Pinky swear.

01:13.282 --> 01:15.113
All right.
Go get 'em.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.074

02:45.916 --> 02:47.076

02:47.585 --> 02:48.745
Emily, where are you, honey?

03:39.595 --> 03:42.086
Is that our precious
little bundle of tumor?

03:44.225 --> 03:46.341
They grow up
so fast, don't they?

03:46.477 --> 03:48.718
How do you think?
How did you know
I was here?

03:50.106 --> 03:51.095
Foreman.

03:52.274 --> 03:55.061
Actually, that would have been
easier. No, I followed you.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.892
It didn't occur to you
that that might mean

03:56.987 --> 03:58.978
I don't want you involved
in my cancer treatment.

03:59.115 --> 04:00.400
I'm not here as a doctor.

04:00.491 --> 04:02.482
I'm here as a towering
pillar of strength.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.150
Be a pillar in the
parking lot.

04:04.328 --> 04:05.317
No.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.995
How many times have I told
you I wanted to be alone

04:08.124 --> 04:10.080
and you've made yourself
a pain in the ass?

04:10.167 --> 04:11.247
I owe you.

04:14.672 --> 04:16.458
My word, not a word.

04:18.843 --> 04:22.506
Realizing I'm most
likely going to regret
this, all right.

04:29.228 --> 04:30.843
(CLANGING)

04:36.110 --> 04:37.520
What are you doing?

04:39.029 --> 04:41.987
My best friend has cancer.
Cut me some slack.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.775
Also, it's spring break.

04:46.412 --> 04:48.243
I'm on vacation.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.780
Although looking at
you now, I can tell

04:50.875 --> 04:53.161
that the wet t-shirt contest
is probably going to suck.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.835
House taking time off
is a bad sign.

05:01.177 --> 05:02.713
(LAUGHS) "A bad sign."

05:03.053 --> 05:06.671
You think the apocalypse is
coming because House wants
to be there for Wilson?

05:06.765 --> 05:07.800
Yes.

05:08.434 --> 05:09.799
You're new.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.103
FOREMAN: We've got a case.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.648
Six-year-old with
a nose bleed

05:17.735 --> 05:21.068
and breathing problems.
She was born with a
rare mutation of A-T.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.898
Emily has a unique variant
on both of her ATM genes.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.734
Her disorder mimics A-T,
but not all of the symptoms.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.576
This is Dr. Elizabeth
Lawson.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.534
She's a developmental
geneticist attached to JHU

05:32.625 --> 05:34.161
and an expert on the
girl's condition.

05:35.753 --> 05:37.414
Elizabeth Lawson.

05:37.588 --> 05:38.577
Emily Lawson.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.081
I'm here as a doctor,
not a mother.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.597
Nose bleeds and breathing
problems are common symptoms

05:50.684 --> 05:52.549
of ataxia telangiectasia.

05:52.645 --> 05:54.055
We could just be seeing
the natural progression of...

05:54.146 --> 05:57.138
It's not. A-T patients
have a life expectancy
of 20 years.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.265
Emily is only six.
It's something else.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.819
I examined her lungs two
days ago. They're
functioning normally.

06:03.948 --> 06:05.813
It says she fell off
a carousel. Head
trauma could...

06:05.950 --> 06:08.942
If the diagnosis was easy,
I wouldn't need you people.

06:11.956 --> 06:14.948
I'm here because according
to Eric, you're the best.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.031
CHI: We are.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.000
Have you considered
Wegener's granulomatosis?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.497
It's a good fit.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.125
But she can't have x-rays.

06:26.345 --> 06:28.677
A-T makes her hypersensitive
to ionizing radiation.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.175
I'll get her prepped
for an MRI.

06:34.979 --> 06:39.018
She knows more about
her daughter's genetic
condition than any of you.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.559
She'll be an asset.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.732
Or she won't, Eric.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.150
This isn't a request.
Use her.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.653
The tumor's spread
to the surrounding tissue.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.455
We're gonna have to shrink
it before we remove
it surgically.

06:57.543 --> 07:01.627
I'm more interested
in exactly how you
plan to do that, Mike.

07:01.714 --> 07:03.250
We start conservative.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.296
Daily radiation treatments
for three weeks.

07:05.384 --> 07:08.217
And if it doesn't shrink
enough after that, we'll
add the chemo...

07:08.345 --> 07:11.678
And if it hasn't shrunk
enough after that, I'm dead.

07:15.769 --> 07:20.559
Look, you have over a 75%
chance that the radiation
alone is enough. Relax.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.180
We've caught this in time.

07:22.276 --> 07:25.939
Catching it in time would have
been before it invaded the
tissue around my thymus.

07:26.030 --> 07:28.271
I want the radiation
and the chemo concurrently.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.364
Why stress your immune
system unnecessarily?

07:31.452 --> 07:32.737
Let's just go with
my plan. Okay?

07:32.870 --> 07:35.452
The radiation first and...
I'm gonna get
a second opinion.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.196
Are you serious?

07:37.291 --> 07:40.158
Look, I've seen you
recommend this exact
treatment dozens of times.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.583
We're done here.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.543
I'll look for a doctor with
some actual balls.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.550
Hey, you need to
talk to your friend.

07:50.721 --> 07:51.927
He's embarrassing himself.

07:52.056 --> 07:54.092
A doctor should be able
to handle his own illness

07:54.224 --> 07:56.510
with a little bit
more dignity.
I agree with Wilson.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.217
My recommended
treatment is sound.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.177
No, I meant about
the ball-less part.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.933
Explains the office.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.441
SIMON: (LAUGHS) It was a
merry-go-round.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.435
She's a kid, Liz.
We were having fun.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.108
You should try it sometime.
Fun?

08:10.240 --> 08:12.902
She's six, not you.
You know she has
balance issues.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.733
I know that she's...
(CLEARS THROAT)

08:16.246 --> 08:19.238
This is Emily's father, Simon.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.869
He was with her
when the symptoms occurred.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.121
I had her all week.
She was fine.

08:24.421 --> 08:28.255
We could come back.
No need. Patient's
ready for transport.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.297
Wake up, sleepy head.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.927
I saw it in the
gift shop. I know how
much you like them.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.479
Thanks.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.600
They're going to take
you for an MRI now.

08:48.153 --> 08:51.486
It means "magic really
cool images."

08:52.449 --> 08:55.657
I thought
it stood for magnetic
resonance imaging.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.278
We've spent a lot
of time in hospitals.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.373

09:08.132 --> 09:09.838

09:14.346 --> 09:15.335
I'm done.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.013
I sunk your battleship?
No.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.800
But I think I'm going to puke.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.226
Good. Now that you're
sufficiently buzzed,

09:23.647 --> 09:26.480
what was the reason
behind you freaking
out on Kondo?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.773
You scared? In denial?

09:28.861 --> 09:33.605
I know you get confused
any time someone thinks
that you're wrong.

09:33.699 --> 09:36.987
But it's not considered
freaking out for a patient to
ask for a second opinion.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.323
Okay, well, here it is.
Kondo was right.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.870
You should be in
radiology right now.

09:42.166 --> 09:45.329
Well done.
You've kept your word
for almost two hours.

09:45.419 --> 09:49.833
Every day you wait, our
pal, Tumie, is growing
larger in your chest.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.090
You want to live, stop
screwing around and do
something about it.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.967
Good idea.

09:56.054 --> 10:00.923
I think I'll start
with spending spring
break on my own.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.348
How are you feeling
in there, Emily?

10:09.443 --> 10:10.603

to be asleep.

Thats”.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.205
My daughters do that, too,

10:25.292 --> 10:28.659
but they know that sometimes
when it seems like mommy
and daddy are fighting,

10:28.754 --> 10:31.712
it's really only because
they're worried about you.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.380
And does your wife
ever want a divorce?

10:40.224 --> 10:42.465
No. Everything's
fine at home.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.424
Hold still now.
No more talking.

10:48.524 --> 10:49.855
What do you think
of her mother?

10:50.234 --> 10:52.145
She called her
daughter "the patient."

with an expiration date,

10:58.867 --> 10:59.822

before any permanent

11:25.185 --> 11:26.686
Primary Raynaud's?

11:26.770 --> 11:29.386
The cold inside the MRI room
could have set it off.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.437
Stress can also precipitate
the condition.

11:31.525 --> 11:35.313
She's shown no evidence of
cold sensitivity and she has
no problems with MRI machines.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.690
There are other
kinds of stress.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.938
She heard you and
your husband fighting.

11:41.118 --> 11:45.407
Unfortunately, she's heard
a lot worse than that
before. It's not stress.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.658
Could be secondary Raynaud's.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.205
Lupus is consistent with
Emily's symptoms.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.499
ELIZABETH: Her lymph nodes
aren't enlarged

11:50.586 --> 11:54.295
and she has shown
no signs of immune activation.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.379
It could be heavy
metal poisoning.

I'm sure he has no idea
what the insulation's made of,

12:09.688 --> 12:11.474
what kind of paint.

12:12.274 --> 12:15.641
He's a good father,
but when it comes
to Emily's health...

12:16.028 --> 12:18.485
I'm gonna get his keys
and check for environmentals.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.607
Lupus is a better fit.

I don't mean to pull rank
here, but I am her mother.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.870
I thought you said you
were here as a doctor.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.905
And as a doctor, I need
parental consent. See above.

12:29.207 --> 12:32.665
While I'm gone,
please start her on
chelation therapy.

12:34.338 --> 12:35.999
She's the mother.

12:36.882 --> 12:38.622
So let's treat her like
any other mother.

12:45.557 --> 12:48.720
I think we just hit
the environmental

It's an experimental

Supposedly it can override
DNA errors in the ATM gene.

Doesn't mean she's giving
it to her daughter.

would be researching it.

it will kill you outright.

14:33.957 --> 14:34.992
The question is,

14:35.500 --> 14:37.456
why didn't you tell me?

14:38.795 --> 14:41.047
Because you knew
I'd stop you.

14:41.840 --> 14:45.173
Which means you've already
found someone insane enough

14:45.469 --> 14:47.380
or desperate enough

14:47.471 --> 14:50.304
to give you
what amounts to a death
dose of chemicals.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.556

be that stupid?

14:54.978 --> 14:58.516

Advanced Lyme disease?

Would have seen
it in the blood.
He said "advanced."

30:21.112 --> 30:24.070
We wouldn't pick it up in her
blood if it's in her organs
and nervous system now.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.441
It fits everything but
the nose bleed.

30:25.533 --> 30:28.866
But why is it attacking
now, all at once?

30:28.953 --> 30:30.489
What's changed?

30:31.205 --> 30:32.741
Elizabeth has.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.576
She stopped giving
Emily the LEX-2.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.499
It's an aminoglycoside
antibiotic.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.373
It's what was keeping
the Lyme in check.

30:41.465 --> 30:44.002
We need to start her
on amoxicillin.

Here's another one.
You look good.

31:18.961 --> 31:21.373
What's the white

31:26.135 --> 31:28.672
It's down to 1,000.
Still dropping.

31:36.145 --> 31:39.137
I need more morphine.
We're out.

31:43.486 --> 31:44.692

31:45.946 --> 31:48.437
You have enough
for both of us?

around here for a minion.

they're a gift,

throwing them up.

signs of that.

Not if the LEX-2 was
keeping it in check.

We live in the city,
we don't have pets.

33:08.988 --> 33:10.353

been in the woods.

I should have told you,

feel about it.

33:21.876 --> 33:23.332
I grew up hunting
with my dad.

33:23.419 --> 33:25.910
I wanted to share it with
my daughter at least once.

33:26.005 --> 33:28.587
We only took pictures.
You don't need to be mad.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.920
Maybe we should
step outside.
ELIZABETH: No.

33:34.471 --> 33:36.962
We can't protect her
from everything.

you'll need a lumbar

They're called adult

I did.

I'm gonna let you change me...

An oncologist with cancer.
Of all the things that could
be killing me...

34:44.667 --> 34:48.330
It's like the universe
is giving me the
big middle finger.

34:54.093 --> 34:57.256
The universe
doesn't care.
Why me?

34:59.181 --> 35:01.342
I was always telling
my patients not to
torture themselves

35:01.433 --> 35:03.810
because there's
no answer.

35:03.894 --> 35:05.009
Sound advice.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.514
It's cruel advice.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.183
They were just trying to
make sense of what
was happening to them

35:09.900 --> 35:12.687
and I'm there telling
them not to bother?

35:14.405 --> 35:18.114
I should've spent my life
being more like you.

35:18.200 --> 35:22.944

35:54.486 --> 35:56.226
They only fight
about me.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.563
That's because they
care so much.

36:00.075 --> 36:05.445
So, maybe when I die,
they'll get back together.

theories we can use.

38:05.701 --> 38:07.566
Hematologic malignancies.

38:07.703 --> 38:10.319
A-T patients are more prone
to that form of cancer.

38:10.414 --> 38:14.032
You think cancer
would present and kill
her in three days?

38:15.085 --> 38:16.825
Not cancer,

38:16.920 --> 38:19.377
but a tumor could
act like a clot.

38:19.465 --> 38:20.750
An atrial myxoma.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.380
CHASE: A primary heart tumor.

38:25.596 --> 38:27.052
The swinging motion
of the myxoma

38:27.139 --> 38:29.721
intermittently blocked the
flow of blood through
the right atrium.

38:30.058 --> 38:34.222
Inf/ow blockage stagnated the
hepatic vein, which clotted
and caused liver failure.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.688
Outflow blockage caused
the Raynaud’s phenomenon
and stroke.

38:37.774 --> 38:40.186
Pieces of the tumor broke off
and lodged in the lungs,

38:40.277 --> 38:43.269
causing Emily’s breathing
problems and the
coughing blood.

38:43.572 --> 38:47.906

surgically and hopefully the
biopsy reveals it's benign.
