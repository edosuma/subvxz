WEBVTT

00:04.170 --> 00:06.572
Here you go.
Thank you.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.074
(music blaring, lively
conversation and laughter)

00:10.577 --> 00:12.411
(drinks splash)
whoa!

00:12.413 --> 00:13.412
Uh, excuse me.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.414
Why should I excuse you?

00:15.416 --> 00:16.715
I did it on purpose.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.118
I'm sorry, what?!

00:19.120 --> 00:20.486
(raises voice):
I said, I bumped into you
on purpose.

00:21.454 --> 00:23.322
I'm flirting with you.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.590
Oh!

00:24.592 --> 00:26.592
Uh... Okay.
(nervously laughs)

00:26.594 --> 00:28.127
Thanks. Uh...

00:28.129 --> 00:30.329
But I'm actually here
with somebody.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.664
Who brings a date
to a mixer?!

00:38.705 --> 00:40.439
Thanks.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.607
I'm back.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.108
Thank god.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.309
I had to fight off
two young professionals

00:44.311 --> 00:45.611
Who wanted to show me
their paystubs.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.113
Is that a euphemism?

00:48.115 --> 00:49.782
Tony:
<i>Oh! Mcgee, I can hear you.</i>

00:49.784 --> 00:51.083
Mcgee:
Well, I should hope so.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.351
Oh, there you go.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.552
Got, 'em. All right.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.120
I mean, I'm, I still got

00:55.122 --> 00:56.422
A little bit
of an issue, but...

00:56.424 --> 01:01.326
I probably should have
taken the job inside.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.461
Bishop:
Um... Don't think that

01:02.463 --> 01:03.662
Would have been good idea.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.197
Bishop's right.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.365
There's enough
eye candy in here

01:06.367 --> 01:08.367
To send you into
diabetic shock.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.468
That's fine, tim,

01:09.470 --> 01:11.070
But I'm fully capable
of handling

01:11.072 --> 01:13.072
Your dweeb-centric...
Responsibilities.

01:13.074 --> 01:15.140
Hey...
Oh! There we go!
There we go.

01:15.142 --> 01:16.708
Dinozzo...
Hmm?

01:16.710 --> 01:19.111
We don't have all night.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.513
All right, let's catch
ourselves a burglar.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.815
Wayne "the snail" levinson.

01:22.817 --> 01:26.385
A glamour shot
to keep him fresh.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.387
Anyone have any idea
why they call him "the snail"?

01:28.389 --> 01:29.421
He's probably
a slow mover.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.722
Can we just stick

01:30.724 --> 01:32.858
To the essentials, please?
Oh, I'm sorry, tim!

01:32.860 --> 01:35.227
Remember, cameras on
the outside only.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.528
Be smart.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.496
He could be armed.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.631
What if...?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.533
Wait...
I think I see levinson.

01:46.573 --> 01:48.273
He's headed towards
the south end.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.441
He just went in the back.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.442
Gibbs:
Wait...

01:50.444 --> 01:51.510
Give him a second.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.811
We have to catch him in the act.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.880
Copy that.

02:01.654 --> 02:03.122
You ready?

02:03.124 --> 02:04.123
Yeah.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.224
This is the best part.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.127
Ncis!

02:08.129 --> 02:10.262
Put your hands
on your head!

02:15.568 --> 02:16.502
Hey!

02:17.737 --> 02:18.804
Bishop:
Gibbs, he's running.

02:21.508 --> 02:22.508
Heading toward brand!

02:22.510 --> 02:25.344
He's definitely
not a slow mover!

02:25.346 --> 02:27.513
He just turned north!

02:28.515 --> 02:30.849
(engine revving)

02:30.851 --> 02:32.151
(tires screeching)

02:33.219 --> 02:34.720
Ncis. Get your hands up.

02:38.758 --> 02:39.758
(chuckles)

02:39.760 --> 02:40.759
We got him.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.227
Tony:
Nice job, everybody.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.695
"the snail"
just became escargot.

02:43.697 --> 02:44.930
He's cooked.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.465
Fini.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.769
Jackson:
<i>Come on now, leroy.</i>

02:52.472 --> 02:55.374
(jackson chuckles)

02:55.376 --> 02:57.643
Mcgee:
Boss, we'll match his prints

02:57.645 --> 02:59.778
To those other burglaries
once we get back.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.182
Yeah. Do that.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.252
Breaking news this morning
from aboard a u.S. Navy ship:

03:40.254 --> 03:41.753
The uss <i>niagara</i>
<i>was conducting</i>

03:41.755 --> 03:44.223
A routine training exercise

03:44.225 --> 03:47.359
Some 200 miles
off the coast of maryland--

03:47.361 --> 03:49.294
That's when fire broke out
in the ship's galley.

03:49.296 --> 03:51.863
Are you listening to this?
Should I be?

03:51.865 --> 03:53.765
(on tv):
...The fire has been contained;

03:53.767 --> 03:55.601
No casualties were reported.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.868
I really need to
pay more attention when I cook.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.003
The last time
I made craw-chiladas,

03:58.005 --> 03:59.605
I almost burned down the house.

03:59.607 --> 04:00.806
Ooh...

04:00.808 --> 04:02.307
Craw-chiladas.
Crawfish enchiladas.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.009
I got the recipe
when I was down in new orleans.

04:04.011 --> 04:07.246
They're my new favorite
thinking food.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.947
Hey, how'd it go
with levinson?

04:08.949 --> 04:10.782
Charged him for last night.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.251
Got him to confess to

04:12.253 --> 04:13.452
The three other burglaries

04:13.454 --> 04:14.786
He was suspected of
in annapolis.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.955
Case closed before breakfast.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.790
Bishop, you talk to
the bar owner?

04:18.792 --> 04:20.492
I did. Uh, levinson's
same old m.O.:

04:20.494 --> 04:21.960
He identified a place

04:21.962 --> 04:23.795
Without proper security
and made his move.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.398
Bar owner said the safe
has been broken for months.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.333
You want to bet
he's gonna get it fixed now?

04:28.335 --> 04:30.969
Said he's gonna change
the name of the bar from

04:30.971 --> 04:32.904
The green star
to the lucky star. (laughs)

04:32.906 --> 04:34.373
Tony:
Speaking of lucky...

04:34.375 --> 04:36.041
I feel like I was
the lucky one last night...

04:36.043 --> 04:37.576
Spending
a little quality time

04:37.578 --> 04:39.044
With mr. Gibbs
in the surveillance van.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.346
Plus, I got to do
that very cool,

04:41.348 --> 04:42.314
Cut-off-the-perp move.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.515
Good stuff.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.617
By the way, tim,
how was your run?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.319
Chasing after "snail,"

04:47.321 --> 04:48.453
I guess he wasn't so slow

04:48.455 --> 04:50.355
After all, huh?

04:50.357 --> 04:52.758
Yes, tony, the name is ironic.
(laughs)
yeah.

04:52.760 --> 04:56.495
It's like when they
call a big guy "tiny."

04:56.497 --> 04:57.596
Gibbs.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.573
(knocking on door,
door opens)

05:10.043 --> 05:13.011
Have a seat.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.849
It's not about levinson?

05:17.851 --> 05:19.951
No.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.487
Okay. Then what?

05:23.723 --> 05:26.024
Employee of your father's

05:26.026 --> 05:28.360
Called the office
looking for you.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.962
He didn't have your cell.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.899
Gibbs, your father had a stroke.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.502
I'm sorry.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.971
He's gone.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.118
Abby: I think we should
go with this company,

05:53.120 --> 05:55.754
'cause their delivery service
reviews are awesome

05:55.756 --> 05:57.122
And you know,
gibbs will be in stillwater

05:57.124 --> 05:58.623
In like 48 minutes.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.493
We don't have to have
the flowers on the curb

06:01.495 --> 06:02.928
When he
gets out of the car.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.596
I know that, but,
and also the other great thing

06:04.598 --> 06:05.864
Is that you can customize.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.399
I was thinking
something simple like this.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.134
Bishop:
Wow.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.535
Jimmy:
Are those suspenders?

06:10.537 --> 06:12.571
Yeah. Uh-huh.
And then we can add

06:12.573 --> 06:14.706
Five jackson-themed
balloons.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.041
I'm just not sure what shape
they should be yet.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.610
Abby, gibbs is gonna appreciate
whatever we send.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.912
There's no reason
to stress.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.582
I have to stress...

06:23.584 --> 06:25.584
Because if I don't stress,
then I'll stop and if I stop,

06:25.586 --> 06:28.653
I'm gonna get
really, really sad.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.921
When my grandma died,

06:29.923 --> 06:31.590
It helped me
just to talk about her.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.092
Maybe you guys could tell me
what jackson was like.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.461
He gave the best hugs.

06:36.463 --> 06:37.596
He was the only one that
could do the

06:37.598 --> 06:39.097
"gibbs stare" at gibbs.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.566
Tony:
With those icy-blue eyes.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.969
He gave me the sweater
off his back once.

06:43.971 --> 06:44.970
White.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.571
Two functional pockets.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.572
Very soft.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.608
I just wish gibbs had...

06:49.610 --> 06:51.510
Taken one of us with him,
you know?

06:51.512 --> 06:53.111
I wish there was something
we could do to help.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.814
Best thing we can do for gibbs
is stay focused and do the job.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.048
Agreed.

06:59.018 --> 07:00.585
And the focus starts now.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.887
Agents dinozzo, mcgee, bishop--

07:01.889 --> 07:03.054
With me to mtac.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.590
Following you
to mtac, sir.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.561
Craig:
<i>Director, agents,</i>

07:09.563 --> 07:11.430
Despite media reports,

07:11.432 --> 07:12.831
Today's incident
onboard the uss <i>niagara</i>

07:12.833 --> 07:15.901
Was not an
accidental galley fire.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.703
Jenkins:
It appears an incendiary device

07:18.705 --> 07:21.573
Was brought onboard
by a civilian contractor.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.707
Casualties.

07:22.709 --> 07:26.711
The contractor
was confronted and shot

07:26.713 --> 07:27.846
Trying to evade capture.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.048
Why the <i>niagara?</i>

07:30.050 --> 07:31.082
Director...

07:31.084 --> 07:33.618
We are carrying prisoners.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.688
Terrorists who've
been indicted.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.723
My team was conducting
onboard interrogations

07:38.725 --> 07:43.228
We believe the fire was a
diversion and a means to an end.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.930
This is a prison break.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.631
Craig:
Yes.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.733
Two prisoners did manage
to escape in the chaos.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.736
Jenkins: Most of
the prisoners were captured

07:51.738 --> 07:55.040
Based on intel from your
interrogation of benham parsa.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.042
Brotherhood of doubt

07:57.044 --> 07:58.677
Was trying to free its members.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.778
Jenkins:
Had the fire reached

07:59.780 --> 08:00.779
Its full potential,

08:00.781 --> 08:01.947
More would have escaped.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.648
The brotherhood
stood to gain,

08:03.650 --> 08:05.050
But it's highly unlikely
they were responsible.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.652
When ncis captured
and killed parsa,

08:07.654 --> 08:09.788
The brotherhood
was financially ruined.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.956
They're basically powerless.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.657
Big picture will come.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.992
Captain, what are
we looking for?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.828
Evidence suggests
the prisoners escaped on a rib.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.597
Speed: Forty-plus knots.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.131
Range: 200-plus nautical miles.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.800
Mcgee:
What are the stats

08:21.802 --> 08:24.069
On the escapees?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.975
(keypad beeping quietly)

08:29.977 --> 08:31.810
Put it away.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.745
Oh. Excuse me, sir.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.514
I'll be right back in,
I was just gonna call--

08:35.516 --> 08:38.149
I know what you're doing,
agent dinozzo, and I said stop.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.519
With all due respect, sir,

08:40.521 --> 08:41.820
I think gibbs
would want the update.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.221
You brief him,

08:43.223 --> 08:44.823
He'll be back at his desk
before lunch.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.691
That's his call.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.527
No. It's my call.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.762
Gibbs needs time.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.731
It's my job
to make sure he takes it.

08:52.733 --> 08:56.635
Anyone else I would agree, sir,
but, leroy jethro gibbs?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.803
Can you handle
point on this or not?

08:58.805 --> 08:59.971
Of course I can.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.306
Good.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.941
Then inform your team,
agent dinozzo.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.243
Gibbs stays where he is.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.279
No contact.

09:07.281 --> 09:08.647
Are we clear?

09:08.649 --> 09:11.983
Clear as a bell, sir.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.960
(sighs)

09:52.858 --> 09:56.728
Jackson:
<i>No one was ever allowed</i>
<i>to touch that winchester.</i>

09:56.730 --> 09:59.598
You tell a kid
he can't have a rifle

09:59.600 --> 10:02.100
And he grows up to be a sniper.

10:13.813 --> 10:18.149
Wait, are you saying
we can't call gibbs at all?

10:18.151 --> 10:19.884
Well, technically,
I guess you could call him,

10:19.886 --> 10:21.152
You just can't talk ships

10:21.154 --> 10:23.154
Or prison breaks.
But, he's gibbs.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.056
He'll know everything
by the way you're breathing.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.124
No calling gibbs.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.892
Okay. Let's do this.
What do we know?

10:27.894 --> 10:32.030
Two prisoners are believed
to have escaped the <i>niagara</i>

10:32.032 --> 10:34.165
Aboard a
rigid-hulled inflatable boat.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.669
The <i>niagara's</i> radar
was compromised by the fire.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.038
Rib started out
around 0500 unnoticed

10:40.040 --> 10:42.040
And could have headed
in any direction.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.642
Narrows it down.
What about the prisoners?

10:44.276 --> 10:46.911
Escapee number one
is edwin smith.

10:46.913 --> 10:50.181
42, canadian and one of the
few prisoners aboard the <i>niagara</i>

10:50.183 --> 10:52.050
With <i>no</i> ties to
the brotherhood of doubt.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.385
Looks like he put in eight years

10:53.387 --> 10:55.086
As an engineer
on a cruise ship.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.988
Experience could come
in handy out there.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.825
Escapee number two
is lateef mir, 30.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.427
Born and raised in karachi.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.828
Mir assassinated a group

11:03.830 --> 11:05.397
Of american journalists
in pakistan

11:05.399 --> 11:06.998
In the name of parsa.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.233
Guy's been tied
to the brotherhood of doubt

11:08.235 --> 11:09.968
Since it started.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.836
Don't get too attached
to the picture, though.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.139
Mir's a chameleon.
He's highly skilled

11:14.141 --> 11:16.775
At changing his appearance
and taking on new identities.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.744
I saw a surveillance photo
of this guy a few years ago.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.112
I can't believe
that's the same guy.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.181
Abby:
So what, mcgee?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.383
Why, did you send
me something?

11:25.385 --> 11:27.318
Yes, a satellite image.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.124
Abby, this e-mail came through
two minutes ago.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.326
Two minutes is two years
in abby time, you know that.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.930
What is it?

11:38.932 --> 11:41.266
Okay, based on ocean currents,
the time of departure

11:41.268 --> 11:43.168
And the amount of fuel,
I was able to narrow down

11:43.170 --> 11:44.969
The search area for the rib.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.404
This is piece
of protected shore

11:46.406 --> 11:49.140
In cape henlopen state park
in delaware,

11:49.142 --> 11:50.308
And this object

11:50.310 --> 11:52.877
Has the same dimensions

11:52.879 --> 11:54.012
As our missing rib.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.181
Mcgee, call it in to fbi
and dhs.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.248
Bishop, you're with me.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.017
Abby, nicely done.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.167
That's it over there.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.769
Matches the specs.

12:17.771 --> 12:20.271
Definitely navy.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.779
Oh, boy.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.286
Looks like edwin smith.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.822
Yep.

12:37.824 --> 12:41.226
Then where's the chameleon?

12:53.038 --> 12:55.306
Ducky:
Ah, the sea...

12:55.308 --> 12:57.909
Once it casts its spell,

12:57.911 --> 13:01.146
Holds one in its net
of wonder forever.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.514
That's jacques cousteau, right?

13:02.516 --> 13:04.382
Yeah.
Oh, I love that guy.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.551
You know, I have <i>the undersea</i>
<i>world of jacques cousteau</i>

13:06.553 --> 13:09.020
On dvd-- can't wait
to watch it with the kiddos.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.321
"kiddos" plural?

13:10.323 --> 13:12.056
You and breena
are expecting twins?

13:12.058 --> 13:13.925
Oh, I thought I
told you, doctor.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.360
Once we found out that we
were pregnant, we decided

13:15.362 --> 13:17.929
That it was just a sign we were
meant to have two.

13:17.931 --> 13:22.233
So, you know, we're gonna
adopt a second eventually.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.903
Why not a third or a fourth?

13:24.905 --> 13:27.038
(chuckles)
two boys and two girls.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.273
I can just see it now.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.808
You and breena

13:29.810 --> 13:31.242
With a-a row of ducklings

13:31.244 --> 13:32.944
Following behind.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.079
I can see that, too.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.881
All right.
Thanks.

13:36.883 --> 13:39.417
Thanks.
Ranger's people
didn't see anything.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.518
We need to move.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.886
Mir's got a head start.

13:41.888 --> 13:42.954
He's gonna use it. Bolo?

13:42.956 --> 13:44.055
It's out wide.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.523
Local leos are canvassing.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.091
All right, let's finish this

13:47.093 --> 13:48.193
And get back out there.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.829
How's it looking, duck man?

13:50.831 --> 13:53.464
First things first,
with whom are we sailing?

13:53.466 --> 13:57.035
Fingerprint positively
I.D.'d him as edwin smith.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.071
Ah, our canadian terrorist.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.073
Well, we know that he
was on the <i>niagara</i>

14:02.075 --> 14:04.375
When the fire broke out.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.179
That shrapnel, doctor?

14:08.181 --> 14:10.014
Yeah, that would be
my conjecture.

14:10.016 --> 14:13.384
An explosion as a result
of the inferno.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.987
Think that's
what killed him?
No.

14:15.989 --> 14:16.988
No, no. Look here.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.924
He has a thumb-impression

14:19.926 --> 14:21.192
Contusion on his neck,

14:21.194 --> 14:24.362
And conjunctival
petechiae.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.364
This man was strangled.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.066
Well, he was
great with boats.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.334
Good to have around.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.568
Once they got to shore,

14:30.570 --> 14:32.103
Mir eliminated
the extra baggage.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.171
All right,
we got to get

14:33.173 --> 14:34.372
This rib back to abby.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.975
(phone rings, tony groans)

14:38.110 --> 14:39.210
Damn.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.378
What?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.946
It's gibbs.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.149
Tony!

14:45.151 --> 14:46.484
Good heavens, did-did you...

14:46.486 --> 14:48.186
Just press "ignore"?

14:48.188 --> 14:49.487
Are you insane?

14:49.489 --> 14:51.189
What am I supposed to do?

14:51.191 --> 14:53.591
Director's orders.

14:53.593 --> 14:57.095
It's like I can feel gibbs
looking at me through the phone.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.297
You've reached very special
agent anthony dinozzo.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.567
I can't get to the phone.
Please leave me a message.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.569
Hey. Dinozzo.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.337
I'm checking in.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.072
Call me back, huh?

15:09.675 --> 15:11.276
(phone beeps off)

15:35.134 --> 15:37.135
(clears throat)

16:07.299 --> 16:09.200
Jackson: I want you
to get another opinion.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.602
Ann:
It's not about what you want,
jackson.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.638
Jackson: Then tell me
I'm wrong.
(sighs)

16:13.640 --> 16:18.309
I can't do this anymore.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.246
Why is mom mad at you?

16:32.624 --> 16:34.993
Young man: <i>Excuse me.</i>
<i>(knocking)</i>

16:34.995 --> 16:36.494
Agent gibbs?

16:36.496 --> 16:39.163
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm cal.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.165
Cal frazier.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.167
Cal.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.569
You worked at the store.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.171
Yeah. Jackson mentioned me?

16:47.173 --> 16:49.240
He spoke highly.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.541
Well, I don't know about that.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.211
I did mostly lifting
and stocking.

16:53.213 --> 16:56.047
No, he said you had
a real head for business.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.448
He did?

17:00.185 --> 17:02.253
I was... There when it happened.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.488
I know.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.757
I tried to, um...

17:07.593 --> 17:09.594
I wish there was something
I could've done.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.429
Cal...

17:11.431 --> 17:14.098
There wasn't.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.301
Oh... This is, uh,

17:17.303 --> 17:18.536
(keys jingling)
my set to the store.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.139
I came by to bring them
back to you.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.141
Appreciate it.

17:23.143 --> 17:26.144
Jackson gibbs saved my life.

17:26.146 --> 17:29.147
I was headed down a bad road
when he hired me.

17:29.149 --> 17:32.183
He said that, uh, the world
was bad enough as it is.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.751
You've got no right

17:33.753 --> 17:36.220
To make it worse.
To make it any worse.

17:36.222 --> 17:39.157
Yeah. You know,

17:39.159 --> 17:42.527
No one ever cared enough to say
stuff like that to me before.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.132
Hey.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.767
Are you busy?

17:49.769 --> 17:51.369
Sir?

17:51.371 --> 17:53.371
I could use some help

17:53.373 --> 17:55.206
Getting the store ready to sell.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.442
Of course.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.310
Tony:
<i>Ready when you are, captain.</i>

17:59.312 --> 18:01.345
Good. Then we won't waste time
on pleasantries.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.614
I'm sure the name fu'ad hansur
means something to you.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.716
Yes. Parsa gave up hansur

18:05.718 --> 18:08.086
As his second in command
during my interrogation.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.521
Jenkins:
Hansur evaded our roundup,
but today he showed his face.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.790
On behalf of the brotherhood,
he released a video

18:12.792 --> 18:15.226
Claiming responsibility
for the break.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.395
Thought you said he didn't have
the funding to pull this off.

18:17.397 --> 18:20.398
They don't. It's why we believe
hansur is lying.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.367
What is your progress
on the search for lateef mir?

18:23.369 --> 18:25.503
Dna confirmed he was in the rib.
We're coordinating

18:25.505 --> 18:28.106
With fbi and dhs
to follow up

18:28.108 --> 18:30.341
On any credible sightings.
Craig:
Anything promising?

18:30.343 --> 18:33.311
Nothing we'd be comfortable
calling solid.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.445
Use all your resources.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.747
You need to apprehend mir now.

18:36.749 --> 18:39.117
I've interrogated him myself.

18:39.119 --> 18:42.120
He's not the type to settle
into a quiet life.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.287
Hairs! Hairs! Hairs!

18:43.289 --> 18:45.756
She really likes it
when there are hairs.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.192
I do. Because a hair is
worth a thousand words,

18:48.194 --> 18:50.128
And I found tons of
them on the rib.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.496
Some belonged to smith, but...

18:51.498 --> 18:53.331
Most were from lateef mir.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.399
The thickness
and the texture

18:55.401 --> 18:57.168
Confirm that these are
facial hair.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.169
What do you see?

18:58.171 --> 18:59.270
Straight edge.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.771
He shaved.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.740
Both his head
and his beard.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.442
This eyebrow hair wasn't shaved,

19:04.444 --> 19:06.744
But it was
bleached.

19:06.746 --> 19:09.380
He's already turning himself
into someone else.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.916
I used everything that I found,
and I made a new composite.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.518
Before...

19:19.791 --> 19:20.858
After.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.293
I would've walked
right by him.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.694
We should add it
to the bolo.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.763
I already did,
and I got a hit.

19:25.765 --> 19:29.400
An off-duty cop saw
this lateef mir walk into a bar,

19:29.402 --> 19:32.336
Go into the back room
and then leave.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.439
What bar?
The green star bar and grill.

19:35.441 --> 19:38.676
The same one levinson tried
to rob last night?

19:43.549 --> 19:46.784
Not moving so fast now,
eh, snail?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.620
That'll be all, thank you.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.393
What were you doing at
the green star last night?

19:55.395 --> 19:56.827
You know what I was doing.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.197
I was robbing the place.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.866
Well, I think there's more
to the story than that.
You don't get it.

20:01.868 --> 20:05.703
I'd rather take the hit
than rat on these people.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.904
If I talk,
I'm dead.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.774
If you don't talk, you're dead.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.442
You see, snail,

20:11.444 --> 20:14.378
You're what they call
a loose end.

20:14.380 --> 20:18.783
So the only way you're safe
is if I take these guys down.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.918
Believe it or not,

20:20.920 --> 20:24.255
I'm the only friend you've got.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.795
I wasn't robbing the place.

20:30.797 --> 20:34.298
The money I took
from the safe was mine.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.900
It was payment.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.802
For what?

20:37.804 --> 20:40.304
For my end.

20:40.306 --> 20:43.874
Three untraceable guns.
Glocks.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.876
I left 'em in the safe.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.946
Some guy was gonna
pick 'em up later today.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.982
Lateef mir?

20:50.984 --> 20:52.984
I don't know.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.785
Wasn't my business.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.455
They paid me half up front
and half in the safe.

20:57.457 --> 21:00.324
"they" who? Who paid you?

21:01.727 --> 21:04.495
The lady that dropped off
the up-front was hispanic.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.331
30s, maybe younger.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.634
She had a baby with her.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.670
Name?
She didn't say.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.373
She's just a gopher.

21:15.375 --> 21:19.844
The job came from a guy
I met in prison.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.580
Name's rivera.

21:22.582 --> 21:26.350
Alejandro rivera.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.757
Oh, wow.
Who's rivera?

21:32.759 --> 21:34.759
Mexican drug cartel.

21:34.761 --> 21:37.028
Tried to kill gibbs
a few years back.

21:37.030 --> 21:38.696
It's a long story but

21:38.698 --> 21:41.999
Not one of the
boss's biggest fans.

21:51.610 --> 21:53.477
He told me it wasn't loaded.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.946
(chuckling)

21:55.948 --> 21:57.481
(quiet laugh)

22:01.620 --> 22:03.354
I'll put this in the garage.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.789
Thanks.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.057
(phone ringing)

22:08.827 --> 22:09.894
Yeah?

22:09.896 --> 22:10.928
Dinozzo, where you been?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.063
Boss, we need to talk.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.664
That bad?

22:13.666 --> 22:15.666
Worse.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.349
Forgive me
if I don't get up.

22:33.418 --> 22:35.019
(wry laugh)

22:36.722 --> 22:39.924
(grunts)
rivera.

22:39.926 --> 22:43.728
For a dirt bag in prison,
you look surprisingly decent.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.996
Hmm. What did you expect,
agent dinozzo?

22:45.998 --> 22:49.633
That I would let myself go?

22:49.635 --> 22:50.968
You know me
better than that.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.670
(chuckles)

22:52.672 --> 22:54.004
Let's see.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.840
What else have you missed?

22:55.842 --> 22:57.975
Paloma.

22:57.977 --> 23:02.713
We had the most beautiful
ceremony for my sister.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.149
I was granted
permission to attend.

23:05.151 --> 23:08.886
Her godson read a poem
by tennessee williams.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.422
Yes.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.691
"we have not long to love.

23:13.693 --> 23:16.761
A night. A day."

23:16.763 --> 23:19.497
Paloma loved poetry.

23:19.499 --> 23:22.466
She was a special lady,
your sister.

23:24.169 --> 23:25.703
Tell me, agent dinozzo.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.872
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

23:27.874 --> 23:30.541
Lateef mir.

23:30.543 --> 23:33.010
Never heard of him.
Oh, come on.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.846
Dues-paying member
of the brotherhood of doubt,

23:35.848 --> 23:39.517
Takes orders from fu'ad hansur.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.752
What is it
that you think you know?

23:41.754 --> 23:43.587
Okay.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.122
We'll keep it simple.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.925
Wayne the snail.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.660
Levinson?

23:49.662 --> 23:51.762
He was here for a time.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.431
But he was released.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.667
You hired him to drop off
some guns for mir.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.669
I have not had
contact with levinson

23:58.671 --> 24:01.705
Since the day he
left this place.

24:01.707 --> 24:04.775
That's your story
and you're sticking to it.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.911
(clicks tongue)
got it.

24:06.913 --> 24:10.548
Last chance
to change your mind.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.983
I don't know anything about it.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.519
Huh.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.655
Mm.

24:17.657 --> 24:20.958
Tell agent gibbs to get well.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.929
Ah. He must have a
touch of the flu, no?

24:24.931 --> 24:27.965
Otherwise, I'd be forced
to believe that he was

24:27.967 --> 24:31.769
Too much of a coward
to face me in person.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.838
(wry chuckle)

24:35.574 --> 24:38.242
He murdered my father
in cold blood.

24:38.244 --> 24:41.846
Did you know that
about your boss?

24:41.848 --> 24:45.149
I don't know anything about it.

24:47.986 --> 24:50.020
What did he say?
Claimed he didn't

24:50.022 --> 24:52.089
Hire levinson
to drop off the guns.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.058
Well, lying must
run in the family.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.594
I went to talk to the owner
of the green star.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.963
Turns out, he is rivera's
second cousin.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.197
Of course he is.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.732
He gave you the runaround?

25:01.734 --> 25:02.967
Stuck to his story.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.835
Said as far as he knew,
we saved him

25:04.837 --> 25:06.203
From getting robbed last night.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.938
You check the safe?
Yup.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.140
No guns.
Cousin probably took them out

25:10.142 --> 25:12.676
The minute he knew we were
outside chasing levinson.

25:12.678 --> 25:16.080
Then handed them over to lateef
mir when he stopped by today.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.748
I got something.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.984
Probably has nothing
to do with what you were

25:19.986 --> 25:21.151
Just talking about,

25:21.153 --> 25:23.120
But... Leticia gomez.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.523
Found her name
in the prison log.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.691
She visited rivera twice
in the last month.

25:27.693 --> 25:31.128
Hospital records show she
had a baby eight months ago.

25:31.130 --> 25:34.164
Matches levinson's description
of the gopher who paid him.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.000
Let's bring her in.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.568
Boss?

25:42.607 --> 25:44.041
Gibbs.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.010
I had a right to know.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.078
I can't have you on this.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.681
My team is in the field...

25:50.683 --> 25:52.116
I get a call.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.184
I was respecting
your situation, gibbs.

25:54.186 --> 25:57.888
Let's not turn this
into something else.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.924
I don't need to be handled.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.092
Your head is not here.
Don't tell me

26:02.094 --> 26:04.228
Me where my head is at.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.264
I am here, director.
I am on this.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.769
What did you say to me
after jackie died?

26:11.771 --> 26:13.604
What did you
tell me to do?

26:13.606 --> 26:15.706
I was out for two months.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.107
That was different.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.842
It's been half a day, gibbs.

26:18.844 --> 26:20.077
He was your father.

26:20.079 --> 26:23.013
He was. And now he's dead.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.949
And I still have a job to do.

26:24.951 --> 26:27.117
And I didn't?

26:27.119 --> 26:30.120
I am not you.

26:32.057 --> 26:33.691
As director of this agency,

26:33.693 --> 26:34.959
I'm placing you on
administrative leave.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.327
As your friend,

26:36.329 --> 26:38.596
I'm telling you to get
the hell out of here

26:38.598 --> 26:41.165
Before you say something
I can't let go.
Leon...

26:41.167 --> 26:43.901
This job.

26:46.838 --> 26:48.906
It's what I have.

26:50.775 --> 26:54.211
Don't ever tell my team
to hold out on me again.

27:02.387 --> 27:05.322
Sorry, I...
Couldn't find a sitter.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.960
What's her name?

27:09.962 --> 27:11.161
Ana.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.165
I can't lose her.

27:15.167 --> 27:18.736
Then you need to tell us
what you know, leticia.

27:23.208 --> 27:27.077
I met alejandro about
eight years ago. He was in dc

27:27.079 --> 27:29.380
On business.
I was a waitress.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.015
I spilled coffee
on him.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.916
How well do you
know him now?

27:32.918 --> 27:36.086
If he asks,
I do jobs for him.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.256
Simple jobs,
to support my daughter.

27:41.126 --> 27:44.228
Yes. I delivered a payment
to wayne levinson.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.764
When I found out
I was pregnant,

27:46.766 --> 27:48.832
Ana's father left me.

27:50.769 --> 27:53.937
I wrote a letter to alejandro.

27:53.939 --> 27:56.006
Then I visited.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.908
It went from there.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.677
Went where?

27:59.679 --> 28:03.147
I love him. He loves me, too.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.816
Look, he tells me things,
but he doesn't...

28:05.818 --> 28:09.186
Leticia, your daughter
needs you more than he does.

28:09.188 --> 28:12.456
I know that.

28:12.458 --> 28:16.260
Child and family services
is a phone call away.

28:25.904 --> 28:27.438
(sniffles)

28:29.174 --> 28:31.408
Alejandro has a network
on the outside.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.945
The reynosa cartel.
He hooked them up

28:34.947 --> 28:39.116
With some of the people he knew
in the mexican government.

28:39.118 --> 28:42.386
Made the cartel stronger.

28:42.388 --> 28:45.756
He's ashamed to be involved with
drugs, but it's the only way.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.224
For what?

28:47.226 --> 28:49.326
Lately, all he could
talk about was

28:49.328 --> 28:51.895
This guy parsa on the news.

28:51.897 --> 28:55.199
After ncis
killed parsa,

28:55.201 --> 28:58.769
Alejandro made contact
with the brotherhood.

28:58.771 --> 29:01.438
He used cartel money
to fund their prison break

29:01.440 --> 29:04.341
Because they had
an enemy in common.

29:06.911 --> 29:10.280
Any prisoner who escaped

29:10.282 --> 29:14.151
Was ordered to hunt down
and kill your agent gibbs.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.323
(water running distance)

29:26.364 --> 29:28.432
(water continues running)

29:35.240 --> 29:37.407
(gibbs sighs, groans)

30:11.242 --> 30:13.310
(water trickling)

30:24.088 --> 30:26.156
(water running)

30:37.101 --> 30:39.403
(electricity sizzling,
crackling, popping)

30:58.356 --> 31:00.290
I bagged the weapon.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.458
Glock 19

31:01.460 --> 31:03.894
With the serial
number filed off,

31:03.896 --> 31:06.463
Just like levinson said.

31:06.465 --> 31:09.933
Most people mourn the passing
of a loved one with a wake

31:09.935 --> 31:13.237
Or sitting shiva.
Both involve spending time

31:13.239 --> 31:16.006
With relatives only seen
on such occasions.

31:16.008 --> 31:18.075
Not my style, duck.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.944
Clearly, jethro. Ah.

31:20.946 --> 31:22.946
I sincerely hope

31:22.948 --> 31:24.581
This is the last
professional visit

31:24.583 --> 31:26.483
I make to your
basement, jethro.

31:26.485 --> 31:30.254
It's becoming unduly repetitive.

31:30.256 --> 31:31.989
Gibbs, anything
else I should get?

31:31.991 --> 31:33.523
Ducky:
Would you be so kind

31:33.525 --> 31:36.326
As to document his
fingers, eleanor?

31:36.328 --> 31:37.628
Sure.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.465
Acid burns on the tips.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.166
Precisely.

31:43.168 --> 31:44.468
What better way
for mir to become

31:44.470 --> 31:46.536
The quintessential everyman

31:46.538 --> 31:49.573
Than by searing off
his identifying features?

31:49.575 --> 31:53.277
Gibbs: <i>We'll talk</i>
<i>when you get back, dad.</i>
<i>Jackson:</i> <i>Yeah.</i>

31:55.580 --> 31:57.414
Why is mom mad at you?

31:57.416 --> 31:59.349
Leroy...

31:59.351 --> 32:00.517
There's a lot in this world

32:00.519 --> 32:02.252
You can't make right.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.923
But this...

32:05.925 --> 32:07.591
This, you can always make right.

32:07.593 --> 32:11.094
And that's a start.

32:24.142 --> 32:27.277
Jethro, why don't you
go back to stillwater?

32:27.279 --> 32:31.415
Funerals are impossible
to plan at a distance.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.016
There's nothing for you here.

32:34.285 --> 32:37.354
Something I got to do first.

32:42.226 --> 32:44.194
Agent gibbs.

32:44.196 --> 32:47.030
<i>Bienvenido a mi casa.</i>

32:47.032 --> 32:50.167
(chuckling):
Please.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.035
Old friends shouldn't be shy.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.338
What can I do for you?

32:54.340 --> 32:58.175
I heard you were asking
for me, so I came.

32:58.177 --> 33:01.211
Oh. This is your plan?

33:01.213 --> 33:05.315
To twiddle your thumbs
until I confess to something?

33:06.484 --> 33:09.052
I don't need anything from you.

33:09.054 --> 33:10.354
Oh.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.990
Everyone needs something,
do they not?

33:14.459 --> 33:16.460
What about your girlfriend?

33:17.628 --> 33:19.396
Excuse me?

33:19.398 --> 33:21.498
What does <i>she</i> need?

33:21.500 --> 33:24.067
Other than better taste in men.

33:24.069 --> 33:27.371
It's a copy
of a statement written by

33:27.373 --> 33:28.705
Leticia gomez.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.741
Says that you farmed out
all your dirty work

33:30.743 --> 33:32.709
To the brotherhood of doubt
because you thought

33:32.711 --> 33:35.479
They couldn't be traced back
to you or your network.

33:38.449 --> 33:40.517
She gave you up.

33:42.420 --> 33:47.424
Fu'ad hansur's
compound last night.

33:47.426 --> 33:50.360
Cia followed your funding trail
straight to it.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.596
Intel suggests
that all remaining leaders

33:52.598 --> 33:55.032
Of the brotherhood
were killed in the strike.

33:55.034 --> 33:57.634
Gibbs:
Like I said,

33:57.636 --> 34:01.238
I don't need a confession
from you, alejandro.

34:06.411 --> 34:08.812
You think I'm dirt?

34:08.814 --> 34:11.281
You think my father was dirt?

34:11.283 --> 34:14.418
Damn right I do.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.821
He took your family,

34:17.823 --> 34:20.524
But he was still my father.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.760
He taught me to swing a bat.

34:23.762 --> 34:27.497
(voice breaking):
He... Told me I could be
a better man than he was.

34:29.167 --> 34:31.768
And you took him from me.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.805
You turned me into this.

34:38.709 --> 34:41.311
You choose...

34:41.313 --> 34:43.680
Who you are without him.

34:43.682 --> 34:46.283
Yes, I choose.

34:46.285 --> 34:50.287
Each day, I choose
to think of my father.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.589
I choose to think of my sister.

34:54.492 --> 34:56.526
And every moment that is left,

34:56.528 --> 35:00.097
I choose to think
of seeing you dead.

35:00.099 --> 35:02.632
(chuckles)

35:02.634 --> 35:05.569
But none of
this matters.

35:05.571 --> 35:07.871
I have freed the devil's men,

35:07.873 --> 35:11.475
And they hate you
as much as I do.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.511
Sooner or later,
they will strike.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.480
(paper rustling)

35:16.482 --> 35:19.349
The only one
who escaped was lateef mir.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.618
That's him.

35:24.188 --> 35:26.256
They let you watch tv
in here?

35:26.258 --> 35:28.658
You should turn
on the news tonight.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.361
You'll see his picture,

35:31.363 --> 35:34.564
Your picture.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.435
It'll be great.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.637
Guard?

35:40.639 --> 35:43.240
We're done here.

35:45.176 --> 35:48.411
Guard!

35:51.282 --> 35:53.283
Man, I wish I could've
seen rivera's face

35:53.285 --> 35:54.718
When gibbs laid
the smack down.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.786
You think he had a little
chin-quiver going on?

35:56.788 --> 35:59.723
I love a good
bad-guy chin quiver.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.693
Mcgee, you're late.
No. Boss gave me

36:03.695 --> 36:05.195
The morning off.
It's delilah's birthday

36:05.197 --> 36:06.763
Next week,
so I thought I'd send her...

36:06.765 --> 36:09.866
Did you take a picture
of rivera's face?
No. Why?

36:09.868 --> 36:12.302
I always miss the good stuff.
Abby:
Gibbs!

36:12.304 --> 36:14.638
Gibbs! Gibbs!

36:14.640 --> 36:16.640
I need gibbs in an
emergency way.

36:16.642 --> 36:17.707
Where is he?

36:17.709 --> 36:19.709
Uh, probably
in stillwater by now.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.712
What?
Abby, breathe and give
us something to go on.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.648
I got the dna back.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.317
The guy that gibbs killed in
his basement was not lateef mir.

36:27.319 --> 36:28.618
What do you mean?

36:28.620 --> 36:30.554
The dead guy's name
is dar tareen.

36:30.556 --> 36:33.456
He's a hired mercenary.
Mir planted those hairs

36:33.458 --> 36:36.693
In the rib to make us think
that's what he looked like.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.795
Then he hired tareen to take
on that look and go after gibbs.

36:38.797 --> 36:41.631
Mir is still out there,
and he could look like anyone.

36:42.967 --> 36:45.835
Boss isn't picking up.
