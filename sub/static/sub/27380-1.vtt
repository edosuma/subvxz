Hammond thinks the WMD is
coming through that lab.

34:34.449 --> 34:36.033

We can have an entry

34:38.742 --> 34:40.813
- There's something we need to talk about.
- What?

34:40.820 --> 34:43.283
The agent who did the
hand-off to Tom Hammond

34:43.324 --> 34:46.158
has been charged with
falsifying reports.

34:46.199 --> 34:47.699
It's early days still,

34:47.742 --> 34:49.217
but the SAC is trying
to do damage control

34:49.242 --> 34:51.699
behind the scenes with
the US Attorney's office.

34:51.742 --> 34:53.283
What kind of damage control?

34:53.324 --> 34:54.949
Cases are being quietly dismissed,

34:54.992 --> 34:57.408
so it doesn't affect
the image of the bureau.

34:59.158 --> 35:00.598
So how do you want me to handle it?

35:02.242 --> 35:03.617
Keep an eye on him.

35:03.658 --> 35:05.158
If he incriminates himself,

35:05.200 --> 35:07.134
we'll bring him into the
RICO with the rest of them.

35:07.158 --> 35:09.575
From what I hear, there's
no way he'll go for that.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.033
Tito. Parked in front of my house.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.033
And you think I told him to do that?

35:36.075 --> 35:37.408
Yeah, I do.

35:38.908 --> 35:42.492
Well, Tito's a very capable man.

35:42.533 --> 35:43.867
Always has been.

35:45.075 --> 35:46.617
If there's a problem,

35:46.658 --> 35:49.033
he can take better care of
your family than you can.

35:52.450 --> 35:54.283
Look...

35:54.325 --> 35:56.075

35:56.117 --> 35:58.367
I don't want him being
seen by Lourdes or my kid.

36:03.117 --> 36:04.908

36:04.950 --> 36:06.283

my daughter or my grandchild,

me you never imagined.

36:21.450 --> 36:23.075
Nothing will happen!

36:23.117 --> 36:24.992
