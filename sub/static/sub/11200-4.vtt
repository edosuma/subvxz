WEBVTT

00:10.911 --> 00:12.845
You came to see me off. That's sweet.

00:12.946 --> 00:15.938
Well, we've been through a lot together,
and I just wanted to come here myself

00:16.049 --> 00:18.779
and make sure
you were thoroughly searched.

00:35.535 --> 00:39.130
This is a little keepsake,
something to remember you by.

00:39.239 --> 00:43.539
-This is a priceless artifact.
-As priceless as the memories we share.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.240
Well.

00:48.081 --> 00:49.480
(CLEARING THROAT)

00:51.785 --> 00:52.979
Thank you.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.553
-I hate long goodbyes.
-Okay, goodbye.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.891
Don't I even get a hug?

01:21.848 --> 01:23.076
Daniel.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.685
Don't make this harder than it already is.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.151
-Can't blame a girl for trying.
-No, I can.

02:05.258 --> 02:09.194
-Jackson, hey, where's the girlfriend?
-She left about an hour ago.

02:09.296 --> 02:12.322
Man, I missed the going-away party?
Hope you saved me a piece of cake.

02:12.432 --> 02:14.832
Now that she's gone, I can finally
get some work done around here.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.995
Yeah, about that. The whole SG-1 thing,
you never gave me a firm answer.

02:18.104 --> 02:19.571
What do you say we make it official?

02:20.740 --> 02:22.002
Jackson?

02:22.108 --> 02:24.804
Jackson! Jackson!

02:25.345 --> 02:27.836
I need a med team on Level 25!

02:33.920 --> 02:35.683
Good morning, sunshine.

02:35.789 --> 02:36.949
(EXCLAIMS)

02:37.057 --> 02:38.752
How're you feeling?

02:41.294 --> 02:42.420
Better.

02:43.063 --> 02:46.123
-What happened?
-We're not exactly sure,

02:47.067 --> 02:49.331
but Dr. Lam here thinks
it may have something to do

02:49.436 --> 02:50.926
with those alien cuffs.

02:55.942 --> 02:57.603
Why does one assume that?

02:57.878 --> 03:00.779
Well, you were completely unresponsive
when we brought you in,

03:00.881 --> 03:04.009
but your condition suddenly improved
when she came back.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.280
Miss me?

04:17.557 --> 04:20.253
-Walter. Just the man I was looking for.
-Sir.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.851
Sir, we have to talk about your schedule,
and according to this,

04:22.963 --> 04:24.453
you're gonna be in meetings all day.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.156
-Hell I am.
-Sir?

04:26.266 --> 04:28.700
After two months on this base,
I've come to realize

04:28.802 --> 04:32.704
that an alarming portion of these meetings
are a complete waste of my time.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.240
This is all housekeeping.
You can handle it.

04:35.342 --> 04:38.709
-Me? No, I don't think so, sir.
-Walter, don't make me promote you.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.474
No, sir. Yes, sir. I mean, just... What?

04:41.982 --> 04:45.611
Just write up the highlights
and leave them on my desk.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.883
-General.
-Dr. Lam.

04:51.958 --> 04:52.925
What's...

04:53.360 --> 04:55.351
What's the latest on Dr. Jackson?

04:55.729 --> 04:58.960
Well, as evidenced by Vala's departure
and immediate return,

04:59.065 --> 05:00.965
they can't be separated
for much more than an hour

05:01.067 --> 05:02.967
before they begin to feel the effects.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.560
If she hadn't come back when she did,
I suspect they'd both be dead.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.368
I thought it was supposed to stop
when they took the wristbands off.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.706
It was. Dr. Lee is theorizing
that it might have something to do

05:11.811 --> 05:14.041
with the Ancient communication device
they found.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.206
It's possible that the two technologies
brought together

05:16.316 --> 05:19.012
somehow combined
to create a more permanent bond.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.546
I see.

05:23.556 --> 05:24.648
Okay.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.797
-This is a waste of time.
-Do me a favor. Shut up.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.460
It's not like I wanted this to happen,
anyway. I'm being realistic.

05:36.569 --> 05:39.037
-He has no idea what he's doing.
-I'm standing right here.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.607
He could do all the tests he wants.
It's not going to get us anywhere.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.403
Look, I know we're scraping
the bottom of the barrel here,

05:43.510 --> 05:44.499
but it's not like we have a lot of choice,

05:44.611 --> 05:47.045
unless you happen to know someone else
who understands this technology.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.682
You know someone?
Someone who can help us?

05:53.286 --> 05:54.344
No.

05:55.388 --> 05:56.787
And yes.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.051
Wait, we're not done here yet.

06:00.293 --> 06:01.282
Who?

06:01.394 --> 06:03.885
A scientist who was studying
the bracelets at one point.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.625
-Well, let's go see him.
-No. Out of the question.

06:06.733 --> 06:07.893
-Why?
-I'd rather not say.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.491
He's the guy
you stole the bracelets from, right?

06:09.602 --> 06:12.036
How dare you assume that I acquired
those bracelets through anything

06:12.138 --> 06:14.902
but honest means.
I may have a less than perfect reputation...

06:15.008 --> 06:16.942
You told me you stole them.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.069
-Did l?
-Yes.

06:21.347 --> 06:22.314
Oh.

06:23.283 --> 06:26.719
-Anyway, he won't help us.
-Correction. He won't help you.

06:28.154 --> 06:33.057
Fine, but if we're going,
I'll need a change of clothes.

06:33.626 --> 06:34.752
Fine.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.422
Fine.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.605
Tell you what.
These outfits make a bold statement.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.438
You don't reckon Landry is gonna make us
work them into the rotation, do you?

06:51.544 --> 06:54.104
Let's see, desert camo, forest green,
and undercover rawhide.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.681
It's got a nice ring to it.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.683
Well, this better be quick. Forty-five
minutes away from your girlfriend,

06:58.785 --> 07:00.412
you're gonna turn into a pumpkin,

07:00.520 --> 07:02.750
and I'm gonna have
to haul your ass back there.

07:06.025 --> 07:07.993
Gentlemen, how can I help you?

07:08.094 --> 07:12.155
-Well, we require your expertise.
-Expertise?

07:12.265 --> 07:16.395
Well, you are the foremost expert
on alien technology on this planet.

07:16.503 --> 07:20.269
The foremost? Well, I don't know
if I'm the foremost expert.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.632
I might be among the top five.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.838
Are you familiar with these?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.350
Yes, yes.

07:32.919 --> 07:36.411
I actually owned a pair myself
up until not too long ago.

07:36.556 --> 07:39.286
-So, you know how they work?
-Of course.

07:39.826 --> 07:43.728
The bracelets create a physiological bond
between the wearers.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.025
They were used by the Goa'uld.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.827
Have you ever heard of the physiological
bond being sustained, say,

07:48.935 --> 07:51.403
after the bracelets were removed?

07:51.938 --> 07:53.735
No, no.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.334
Barring some freak power surge
in the bracelets themselves

07:58.444 --> 08:02.813
that might somehow
transfer their effects outright,

08:03.049 --> 08:04.414
it's highly unlikely.

08:04.517 --> 08:07.714
But in the unlikely event this did happen,

08:08.354 --> 08:11.255
would you be able
to sever the connection?

08:11.724 --> 08:13.385
I might be able to.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.421
Great. Could you tell us?

08:26.539 --> 08:27.836
How is she?

08:29.375 --> 08:31.343
-Who?
-Vala.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.337
We don't know any Vala.

08:37.584 --> 08:39.484
Then I'm afraid I can't help you.

08:39.786 --> 08:43.119
Okay, maybe we know a Vala.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.047
I need to see her.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.151
Why?

08:47.460 --> 08:50.554
It's not what you think.
I'm not after revenge.

08:50.763 --> 08:55.029
The truth is, the bracelets weren't
the only thing she took from me.

08:56.002 --> 08:57.663
She also stole

08:59.872 --> 09:01.100
my heart.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.539
-Excuse me?
-I remember it as if it were yesterday.

09:06.646 --> 09:11.481
Some nights we would steal away
from the city,

09:11.818 --> 09:16.778
strip off our clothing
and bathe in the Springs of Aragatan.

09:18.658 --> 09:21.889
We would chase one another
across the mossy hills

09:21.995 --> 09:26.932
and then lie naked under Adora's moons,
and Vala would...

09:28.568 --> 09:32.595
Okay, that's great. Thanks.
We got the picture.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.534
Very vivid, very disturbing picture.

09:35.908 --> 09:40.572
Yes, those were wonderful, carnal times.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.012
But that's in the past.

09:43.683 --> 09:48.086
All I ask now is that I be given
the chance to see her one last time.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.185
Bring me Vala,
and I'll consider helping you.

09:59.699 --> 10:01.326
HARRlMAN: Sir,
Major Gibson is here to see you.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.423
LANDRY: Send her in.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.498
-General.
-Major.

10:06.739 --> 10:09.867
-How are things at the Pentagon?
-Not so good, I'm afraid.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.340
The lnternational Committee
has reviewed your budget proposals,

10:12.445 --> 10:14.970
and despite your warnings of how
it'll affect the day-to-day operations

10:15.081 --> 10:16.173
of Stargate Command,

10:16.282 --> 10:18.341
they have decided to throw
their full financial backing

10:18.451 --> 10:19.975
behind the Atlantis mission.

10:20.219 --> 10:22.915
They now see this base
as serving little more than a support role.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.647
-Can't say I'm surprised.
-They've been going over the report

10:25.758 --> 10:27.419
brought back by Dr. Weir
and her colleagues.

10:27.527 --> 10:30.257
With the prevalence of Ancient technology
in the Pegasus Galaxy,

10:30.363 --> 10:32.126
they feel that's where
we should be focusing our efforts.

10:32.231 --> 10:34.199
-And you believe that?
-Sir?

10:34.367 --> 10:38.895
Atlantis is a civilian operation.
They approved Dr. Weir's appointment.

10:39.839 --> 10:42.205
The reason they don't want to support
Stargate Command

10:42.308 --> 10:44.776
is because they have no say
in how it's run.

10:45.111 --> 10:46.874
That's what General O'Neill said.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.813
He also said he'd be willing to go to bat
for you with the President,

10:51.050 --> 10:52.813
but he thinks it might help
if you take your case

10:52.919 --> 10:55.251
to the Chairman
of the Appropriations Committee yourself.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.583
Does he?

10:58.725 --> 11:00.818
Oh, Jack, Jack, Jack.

11:06.699 --> 11:07.859
Arlos?

11:12.205 --> 11:14.173
I thought I'd never see you again.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.536
Hello, Vala.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.945
They overpowered me.

11:25.485 --> 11:30.218
Some five, six mercenaries one morning,
on my way to see you.

11:30.890 --> 11:35.020
And they demanded that I steal
the bracelets under penalty of death.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.696
I don't care.

11:42.635 --> 11:43.829
Arlos,

11:49.342 --> 11:51.401
are you going to have me killed?

11:54.180 --> 11:55.204
No.

11:56.682 --> 12:01.483
The memories of what we shared,
and you so callously threw away,

12:02.221 --> 12:05.418
will undoubtedly haunt you
until the day you die.

12:05.525 --> 12:08.517
That should be punishment enough.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.756
Yes, you're right.

12:12.865 --> 12:14.423
That should do it.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.563
I'm over you.

12:19.238 --> 12:23.937
What I am not over, however,
is the theft of my mother's necklace.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.768
I want it back.

12:27.547 --> 12:31.813
Only then am I gonna tell you
how to sever the link connecting you.

12:32.385 --> 12:36.788
Be realistic. That necklace is gone.
There's no way I can get that back.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.423
Well, then our business is done.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.859
Whoa, hang on, loverboy.

12:45.131 --> 12:46.894
We'll get your mama's necklace.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.168
Then we have a deal.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.749
This once belonged
to the First Prime of Bastet.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.579
It's completely unique, one of a kind,

13:05.685 --> 13:10.213
and I am going to give it to you
for three ounces of naquadah.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.414
No? Two for five!

13:18.431 --> 13:21.730
So, business not so good, huh?

13:22.368 --> 13:25.667
Well, with no planets to conquer
and no cities to loot,

13:26.138 --> 13:29.630
how is a Jaffa expected to put food
on the table?

13:31.444 --> 13:33.912
Listen, a mutual friend of ours
was supposed to send word

13:34.013 --> 13:35.241
that we were coming.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.111
-What mutual friend?
-Vala.

13:37.583 --> 13:38.880
(CLICKING)

13:41.053 --> 13:43.851
-Where is she?
-We're not sure.

13:43.956 --> 13:47.289
She said she had some business to attend
to and she'd meet us back at the gate.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.388
She didn't call ahead?

13:50.596 --> 13:54.123
I swore the next time I saw Vala,
I'd kill her where she stood.

13:54.934 --> 13:58.062
-That's a no.
-Do you take me for a fool?

13:58.204 --> 14:00.104
I don't know about them,
but I certainly do.

14:00.206 --> 14:01.639
Hello, lnago.

14:03.943 --> 14:07.140
-Nicely done on the distraction, boys.
-Oh, that's what we're doing?

14:07.246 --> 14:09.214
You didn't want to let us in
on your little plan?

14:09.315 --> 14:10.748
You would have just screwed it up.

14:11.017 --> 14:15.716
Vala, you cowardly, backstabbing,
sorry excuse for a woman,

14:16.455 --> 14:17.547
how've you been?

14:17.690 --> 14:22.491
Inago, you filthy, double-talking slug,
nice to see you, too.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.291
Obviously they used to date.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.888
Do you remember that necklace
you sold me?

14:26.999 --> 14:30.435
The priceless heirloom
from the House of Verenna?

14:30.603 --> 14:35.267
-I may have overstated its value slightly.
-Slightly? It was worthless.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.600
VALA: You're one to talk.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.609
That Goa'uld force-shield inhibitor
turned out to be

14:38.711 --> 14:41.874
nothing more than a power coil
from an obsolete cargo ship.

14:43.049 --> 14:46.382
Fortunately, I'm not here for revenge.

14:46.786 --> 14:50.586
In fact, I'm here to set things straight.

14:53.593 --> 14:58.257
-By buying back that worthless necklace.
-Why?

14:59.131 --> 15:00.428
What's your angle?

15:01.634 --> 15:03.101
You don't need to know.

15:03.769 --> 15:07.068
Well, then I guess you don't need
that necklace. No deal.

15:07.239 --> 15:11.573
However, I am willing to show you
how I want to square things here.

15:12.144 --> 15:15.307
I might consider buying back
that useless power coil.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.440
Why would you want to buy back
a power coil from an obsolete cargo ship?

15:23.189 --> 15:25.350
No necklace, no deal.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.716
I've got an idea.
How about a straight swap,

15:28.828 --> 15:30.386
necklace for power coil?

15:30.496 --> 15:32.396
-No.
-Well, wait, wait, wait.

15:32.498 --> 15:36.491
I have a better idea. We dig a big old pit,

15:36.636 --> 15:39.571
we drop these two in it,
and we let them fight it out.

15:40.906 --> 15:42.134
I'll ask again.

15:44.510 --> 15:45.568
Deal?

15:51.150 --> 15:52.242
Deal.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.447
Deal.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.418
Of course, I don't have the power coil.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.547
We're gonna have to go and get that back.

15:59.692 --> 16:03.253
Where would you unload
an obsolete power coil?

16:13.572 --> 16:18.339
-Sister Vesina. Welcome back.
-Brother Caius.

16:18.711 --> 16:22.841
-How are the orphans?
-The orphans are well, thank Grannus.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.375
-And you?
-Well enough, thank Grannus.

16:26.686 --> 16:27.675
Who's Grannus?

16:27.787 --> 16:30.347
Minor Celtic God.
One of Camulus' former lieutenants.

16:30.456 --> 16:31.445
Thanks.

16:31.557 --> 16:35.152
Of course, all of us continue
to be grateful for your generous gift.

16:35.695 --> 16:40.155
Pilgrims from all over the system travel
to see the legendary Ring of Shen-Marak.

16:40.766 --> 16:44.099
However, it has been
a bittersweet season for us,

16:44.203 --> 16:48.606
since, coincidentally, around the same
time you made your gracious donation,

16:49.041 --> 16:53.102
the shrine's most precious relic,
the Livanna Crystal,

16:53.212 --> 16:55.373
-mysteriously disappeared.
-No.

16:56.248 --> 17:00.844
Yes, it is shocking
the depths some people will plumb.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.686
Unfortunately,
I have some more bad news.

17:05.891 --> 17:10.851
It appears I was deceived, and this
Ring of Shen-Marak is apparently a fake.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.591
-I'm afraid you'll have to get rid of it.
-Out of the question.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.593
Hey, it's bogus.

17:17.803 --> 17:20.431
Your followers are worshipping
a phony relic.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.406
Yes, but ultimately its true worth
can only be judged

17:23.509 --> 17:27.001
by the genuine faith it instills in the hearts
of the many pilgrims

17:27.113 --> 17:28.603
who've come to visit the shrine,

17:28.714 --> 17:32.172
and, more importantly,
in the charitable contributions they make

17:32.284 --> 17:34.343
-while they are here.
-Right.

17:35.054 --> 17:39.957
Of course, if you were willing to make
a substantial contribution of your own...

17:45.765 --> 17:46.432
What do you want?

17:46.432 --> 17:47.160
What do you want?

17:49.969 --> 17:52.733
I have to get out of here.
I can't take it anymore.

17:53.172 --> 17:56.664
The fasting, the chanting,
bathing of the poor.

17:57.143 --> 18:01.477
If I have to weave one more prayer basket,
I'm gonna kill someone.

18:02.148 --> 18:05.481
Blessed day. Blessed day. Blessed day.

18:07.319 --> 18:08.479
MlTCHELL: Oh, my!

18:09.622 --> 18:11.351
You're not a real monk?

18:13.025 --> 18:17.257
He used to be a smuggler,
one of the best I ever knew.

18:18.297 --> 18:22.063
Then things got a little too hot for him,
and he had to find religion.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.193
Well, it was a sweet racket while it lasted.

18:24.303 --> 18:28.262
Until the great god Grannus went
and got himself executed by his own Jaffa.

18:28.574 --> 18:32.567
Since then, the number of pilgrims
has been, well, significantly reduced.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.436
-That's why you can't have the Ring.
-Power coil.

18:35.548 --> 18:39.985
Whatever. The point is that it's the only
thing keeping this place going.

18:40.085 --> 18:43.612
If you wanna go, why not just go?

18:43.722 --> 18:46.350
Because all I got right now
are the clothes on my back.

18:48.093 --> 18:51.756
I need my cargo ship,
the one you borrowed.

18:53.732 --> 18:55.700
Yes, that might be a bit of a problem,

18:56.101 --> 18:59.867
but we can get you a replacement.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.532
No deal.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.640
What's so special
about this particular cargo ship?

19:04.777 --> 19:07.371
Let's just say I made a few modifications
of my own.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.844
You bring it to me,
and I'll give you the ring.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.279
-Power coil.
-Power coil.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.944
Look, don't try anything, all right?

19:14.220 --> 19:16.518
The pilgrims of Grannus
may be greatly reduced in numbers,

19:16.622 --> 19:18.351
but they are more fanatical than ever.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.618
You'd have to be
to be worshipping a dead god.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.160
I give the word,
and they will tear you to pieces

19:23.262 --> 19:24.957
before you can get halfway to the gate.

19:25.064 --> 19:30.001
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have morning prayers to attend to.

19:36.575 --> 19:38.167
So, how do we get this ship?

19:39.411 --> 19:41.675
-We can't.
-JACKSON: Why not?

19:42.681 --> 19:45.912
We've come this far. What's the problem?

19:55.327 --> 19:56.726
What news?

19:56.996 --> 19:59.760
We've put the word out,
but she has yet to appear.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.459
I needn 't remind you
that because of your bungling

20:02.568 --> 20:06.527
we already Iost a case
of weapons-grade refined naquadah.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.574
Now someone has to pay,
and ifit's not Vala,

20:09.675 --> 20:11.575
then it might as well be you two.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.676
Rest assured, Vala can't hide forever.

20:16.815 --> 20:21.275
And when she turns up,
we'll deliver her, dead or alive.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.752
See that you do.

20:23.222 --> 20:27.716
And Iet it be known that no one defies
the Lucian AIIiance.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.923
So, let me get this straight.

20:34.033 --> 20:38.993
You need to get this ship to get
the power coil to get the necklace

20:39.638 --> 20:43.074
to get this guy to tell you how to undo
whatever is keeping you two connected?

20:44.510 --> 20:47.001
Yeah, that about sums it up.

20:47.313 --> 20:50.942
Unfortunately, that ship is now
in the hands of the Lucian Alliance.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.575
-The who?
-It's a coalition

20:53.819 --> 20:56.913
of former smugglers and mercenaries
who've banded together

20:57.022 --> 21:01.049
to take advantage of the power vacuum
left by the demise of the Goa'uld.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.924
The fact they've managed to form
a coherent group makes them unique,

21:04.029 --> 21:07.362
and a particular threat, especially
to the newly formed Jaffa government.

21:07.466 --> 21:08.797
Can we contact them?

21:09.034 --> 21:10.729
They won't deal with someone
they don't know.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.698
I assume they know you.

21:13.806 --> 21:18.505
Well, yes, but our last encounter
didn't exactly go as planned.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.811
Oh, let me guess.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.975
You screwed them,
and now they want to kill you?

21:24.083 --> 21:26.483
Actually, it was Daniel
who messed up the deal.

21:26.585 --> 21:28.052
You tried to sell them a stolen ship.

21:28.153 --> 21:30.178
You're the one that told them
they couldn't have it.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.690
The point is, if they see either of us again,
they will kill us.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.089
Can we take this ship by force?

21:36.195 --> 21:38.163
You'd have to go up against
a sizeable armada.

21:38.263 --> 21:41.494
If the alternative is staying linked to you,
I'm willing to take that risk.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.965
I'm sorry, Dr. Jackson, but I can't allow it.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.269
Dr. Lee is continuing his research.

21:47.373 --> 21:50.069
Hopefully, he'll be able to come up
with something on his own.

21:50.376 --> 21:55.075
In the meantime, you're just gonna have
to learn to live with each other.

21:56.682 --> 22:01.119
And by the way, in three days
you're coming to Washington.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.414
-We are?
-I am?

22:02.521 --> 22:03.749
I need you to testify

22:03.856 --> 22:06.256
in front of the Chairman
of the Appropriations Committee.

22:06.358 --> 22:08.485
Let him see exactly what we're up against.

22:08.794 --> 22:11.160
Your experience with the Ori
could go a long way

22:11.263 --> 22:13.959
towards convincing him
of the dangers headed our way.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.260
Right.

22:17.469 --> 22:19.596
We will do our best, sir.

22:34.086 --> 22:39.023
Daniel, do you happen to have
one of these credit cards?

22:40.125 --> 22:43.356
Yes, I do. And, no, you can't.

22:47.099 --> 22:50.830
By the way,
is a security escort still necessary?

22:51.170 --> 22:53.070
Do you really have to ask?

22:55.574 --> 22:57.804
I noticed you've assigned a woman.

22:58.310 --> 23:02.110
Are you afraid that I might corrupt
one of your impressionable young men?

23:03.015 --> 23:04.744
No, I just thought
I'd save someone the trouble

23:04.850 --> 23:06.875
of having to rebuff your advances.

23:07.252 --> 23:09.186
How do you know you succeeded?

23:13.292 --> 23:14.759
I'm so bored!

23:15.794 --> 23:19.787
-What do you do around here for fun?
-I'm doing it.

23:19.898 --> 23:23.356
I'm translating these artifacts
from P4S-559.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.937
Oh! Are they valuable?

23:26.038 --> 23:29.701
Well, their historical value is immense,
but there's no gold or jewels involved,

23:29.808 --> 23:31.366
if that's what you mean.

23:34.446 --> 23:37.609
-Don't touch that!
-Do you know what?

23:37.916 --> 23:41.010
You need to occasionally get up
from under the dust

23:41.120 --> 23:44.749
of dead civilizations and live a little.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.586
Why don't you take me out to dinner?

23:48.694 --> 23:50.127
Look, the only way
you're getting off this base

23:50.229 --> 23:51.958
is on our little side trip to Washington.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.191
If we could find a way around that,
we would.

23:54.299 --> 23:56.733
Why don't we go offworld?

23:56.835 --> 24:00.032
I've got a great little deal cooked up
with some traders on Katana.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.197
No.

24:02.307 --> 24:03.934
We could be partners.

24:04.042 --> 24:06.306
We can split everything
down the middle, 60-40.

24:09.515 --> 24:11.915
It hardly seems fair
that your life gets to continue

24:12.017 --> 24:14.485
-and my affairs are put on hold.
-Excuse me?

24:14.586 --> 24:16.611
I should be on my way
to the Pegasus Galaxy right now.

24:16.722 --> 24:17.950
Oh, don't you blame that on me.

24:18.056 --> 24:21.514
It's your own curiosity in the Ancient
treasure that cost you a trip to Atlantis.

24:21.627 --> 24:24.425
-You cuffed us together!
-You weren't paying attention at the time.

24:24.530 --> 24:27.260
Look, we can point fingers all we want,

24:27.366 --> 24:31.598
but the fact is we're stuck together,
so like it or not,

24:31.770 --> 24:33.738
we're just gonna have to learn
to get along.

24:33.839 --> 24:35.238
(SHATTERING)

24:45.184 --> 24:46.885
I found your glasses.

24:46.885 --> 24:47.044
I found your glasses.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.859
I'm gonna go see what Dr. Lee is doing.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.960
-Hello.
-What the hell are you doing here?

25:31.230 --> 25:32.663
Isn't this my room?

25:32.764 --> 25:37.701
No, your room is across the hall
with the guard in front of it.

25:38.637 --> 25:42.471
Ah, yes.
They do all rather look alike, don't they?

25:43.342 --> 25:47.904
Anyhow, since I'm here,
shall we make the best of it?

25:50.882 --> 25:53.646
-No, we shalln't.
-Come on, Daniel.

25:54.186 --> 25:57.952
We're both stuck here on this base,
and there's nothing else to do.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.616
Yes, there is.
There's sleeping. There's working.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.387
There's finding a way out of this mess.

26:02.494 --> 26:03.961
What if we can't?

26:04.062 --> 26:05.893
We might have to spend
the rest of our lives together.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.966
No, don't even go there.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.225
There's literally a bond between us.

26:10.335 --> 26:13.736
Some people might even
find that romantic.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.170
I'm not one of those people.

26:19.978 --> 26:22.003
Am I really so repulsive?

26:22.814 --> 26:24.111
No.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.141
No.

26:29.554 --> 26:33.650
No. You're not repulsive. You're just...

26:38.697 --> 26:42.463
It's just that I know what you're doing
with the whole sexual thing.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.091
It's a defense mechanism.

26:45.804 --> 26:48.034
-Really?
-Yeah.

26:48.173 --> 26:50.573
You live a solitary existence.
You move from place to place.

26:50.676 --> 26:53.270
You never form any lasting relationships.
You use sex as a weapon

26:53.378 --> 26:55.903
to prevent yourself from forming
any real emotional bonds.

26:59.584 --> 27:01.176
Textbook case.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.251
I never realized I was so transparent.

27:07.826 --> 27:11.922
-Vala...
-No, really, it's fine, Daniel. You're right.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.198
I can see why you wouldn't want
to become involved

27:14.299 --> 27:15.596
with someone so pathetic.

27:17.769 --> 27:19.896
I wasn't always like this, you should know.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.135
There was someone once.

27:22.808 --> 27:25.368
In fact, I was engaged.

27:26.545 --> 27:28.740
Then I was taken as a host.

27:28.847 --> 27:31.179
And even though
the Tok'ra eventually freed me,

27:31.283 --> 27:33.114
the damage was already done.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.412
And once you have been spat on

27:36.521 --> 27:41.390
and stoned by the people
of your own village,

27:43.895 --> 27:45.021
well,

27:46.331 --> 27:49.300
you try forming lasting relationships.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.063
Vala, just wait, wait. Please, stop.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.735
All right, I'm sorry.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.336
Okay?

28:01.613 --> 28:05.140
I'm sorry, I just... Sometimes I just...

28:06.318 --> 28:08.445
I forget what you've been through.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.255
If you've actually been through any of that.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.325
-Are you messing with me?
-ls it working?

28:14.426 --> 28:17.156
You get out! Go. Get out.

28:19.498 --> 28:20.556
Go.

28:27.739 --> 28:31.698
Despite the fact that the Jaffa are free
and Anubis has been defeated,

28:32.210 --> 28:35.338
it would be a mistake to assume
that the Goa'uld are no longer a threat.

28:35.447 --> 28:39.406
But without the Jaffa to do their bidding,
they're effectively crippled.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.645
Many still have the loyalty
of their human slaves.

28:42.854 --> 28:45.220
Slaves are a long way
from an effective army.

28:45.323 --> 28:48.156
And besides, if the Jaffa saw the light,

28:48.260 --> 28:51.593
it will only be a matter of time
before these slaves follow suit.

28:52.297 --> 28:54.629
The Goa'uld aren't the only threat
out there, sir.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.601
So, I assume that you're referring
to these people

28:57.702 --> 29:00.637
you supposedly met in a distant galaxy.

29:01.406 --> 29:05.502
-Supposedly?
-Well, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

29:05.610 --> 29:09.842
but according to the report I read,
you never actually left Stargate Command.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.946
You went into a coma,
had some kind of vision.

29:13.051 --> 29:16.248
For all we know, the whole thing could've
been an elaborate hallucination.

29:16.354 --> 29:18.219
One of the Priors came through the gate.

29:18.323 --> 29:21.952
A single man who did nothing
but spout a lot of religious nonsense

29:22.060 --> 29:24.051
and then killed himself.

29:24.162 --> 29:28.189
Senator, I was there.
The man burned himself to death

29:28.300 --> 29:31.269
without the aid of any obvious devices
or technology.

29:31.369 --> 29:33.803
-lt was no parlor trick.
-We're also beginning to get reports

29:33.905 --> 29:36.669
that there are other Priors
showing up on other planets.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.903
It's hardly surprising
that new religious groups would arise

29:40.011 --> 29:41.774
in the wake of the Goa'uld's collapse.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.246
The Ori are very real, Senator.

29:44.716 --> 29:47.310
As Ascended beings, they have
all the appearance of genuine gods.

29:47.419 --> 29:50.115
But again,
and this is according to your testimony,

29:50.222 --> 29:53.885
they cannot act in this galaxy
without incurring the interference

29:53.992 --> 29:56.426
of these other Ascended beings.

29:57.896 --> 30:00.194
-lsn't that correct?
-Technically, yes.

30:00.298 --> 30:03.199
Well, now, look at it
from our point of view, Dr. Jackson.

30:03.401 --> 30:08.031
Finally, after eight years
and billions of dollars spent,

30:08.807 --> 30:12.709
the Goa'uld have been neutralized
along with the Replicators.

30:13.178 --> 30:18.115
And now, suddenly out of nowhere,
along come these magical Ori

30:18.884 --> 30:22.115
requiring a redoubling of efforts
and expenditures.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.450
Exactly what are you suggesting, Senator?

30:26.791 --> 30:31.524
The Stargate program has succeeded
in acquiring alien technology.

30:32.564 --> 30:37.126
So, now it's time to devote our resources
to exploiting those technologies

30:37.235 --> 30:38.998
for planetary defense.

30:39.104 --> 30:42.505
Namely, by building more
Daedalus class ships.

30:43.475 --> 30:46.308
Now, we have no intention
of shutting you down completely.

30:46.411 --> 30:49.312
You will continue to operate
at 30% of your current budget.

30:49.414 --> 30:52.144
I think you will find that
that is more than enough money

30:52.250 --> 30:54.980
once you de-emphasize new exploration.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.381
If you recall, Senator,
it was new exploration

30:57.489 --> 31:00.151
that got us those technologies
in the first place.

31:00.559 --> 31:05.087
Now, there are still thousands of Stargate
addresses left unexplored in this galaxy.

31:05.196 --> 31:09.132
This program doesn't exist
to satisfy your curiosity, Doctor.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.638
The important thing is
that we have learned enough

31:14.739 --> 31:18.402
to defend this planet
against any potential threats.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.110
(LAUGHING)

31:23.214 --> 31:25.512
Do you have something to say?

31:25.817 --> 31:27.910
Well, it's just all so amusing, isn't it?

31:28.453 --> 31:32.583
I mean, only an idiot would assume
that this backwater of a planet was safe

31:32.691 --> 31:36.320
because you have a few ships
with decent shield technology.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.232
You don't look like an idiot to me.

31:42.934 --> 31:47.337
So, I have to assume that the reason
why you would want to build more ships

31:47.439 --> 31:53.605
is, like other men, you like big machines
with big engines that fire big missiles,

31:53.945 --> 31:56.641
because you have a deep-seated need
to overcompensate

31:56.748 --> 31:59.649
-for your own shortcomings.
-Excuse me?

32:00.385 --> 32:02.114
See? She knows what I mean.

32:04.956 --> 32:07.720
I think a short recess
would be a good idea.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.258
I'm done here, anyway.

32:12.397 --> 32:13.762
This meeting is over.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.165
How did it go, sir?

32:18.269 --> 32:20.897
Let's just put it this way,
you're going after that ship.

32:21.006 --> 32:23.236
The cargo ship?
What about the Lucian Alliance, sir?

32:23.341 --> 32:25.502
You'll have to figure out a way
to deal with them.

32:25.844 --> 32:26.936
Why? What happened?

32:27.045 --> 32:30.503
She accused the Chairman
of the Senate Appropriations Committee

32:30.615 --> 32:34.608
of having... Well, let's just call it
an insufficient manhood.

32:35.053 --> 32:36.645
She's gotta go.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.591
VALA: Just a word of warning.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.756
Tenat and Jup
are notoriously unscrupulous traders.

32:47.866 --> 32:49.993
They're crafty, devious,
and although stupid,

32:50.101 --> 32:53.002
under no circumstances
are they to be trusted.

32:53.104 --> 32:56.130
MlTCHELL: In other words, they're gonna
try to screw us before we screw them.

32:56.241 --> 32:58.368
We should be all right
as long as you keep your guard up

32:58.476 --> 33:01.070
and we keep focus
on what needs to be done.

33:01.312 --> 33:04.247
Close the deal, take the ship,
and make sure they don't kill me.

33:04.349 --> 33:05.839
Certainly not in that order.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.817
I still think we need some more boots
on the ground, just to be safe.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.388
Tenat will most certainly run
a surface scan of the planet.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.457
Additional life signs or any ships in orbit

33:13.558 --> 33:16.254
would only raise suspicions
and jeopardize everything.

33:18.496 --> 33:22.398
We're approaching the planet.
Run a surface scan.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.098
Four life signs.

33:26.805 --> 33:28.830
Let's go greet them.

33:31.242 --> 33:34.803
-This is a good plan. Very inspired.
-Yes, we have you to thank for that.

33:34.913 --> 33:37.040
Nothing motivates
like complete and utter desperation.

33:37.148 --> 33:39.173
You say that now,
but you will miss me when I am gone.

33:39.284 --> 33:40.751
No, I'm pretty sure I won't.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.245
Just like old times, huh?

33:44.189 --> 33:48.125
I'm offering my assistance on this mission
only to aid Daniel Jackson.

33:48.593 --> 33:52.893
My participation should not be construed
as a desire to rejoin SG-1.

33:53.164 --> 33:54.290
Right.

33:56.167 --> 33:59.295
Colonel Mitchell,
at times you remind me of O'Neill.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.502
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

34:04.008 --> 34:05.270
As you wish.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.226
Teal'c.

34:30.435 --> 34:31.766
(CLICKING)

34:37.375 --> 34:41.607
Hey, fellas, what's with all the hostility?

34:42.881 --> 34:47.375
Vala, how does it feel
knowing your sorry life is about to end?

34:47.552 --> 34:48.541
I don't know.

34:48.653 --> 34:52.111
How did it feel telling the Alliance
that you half-wits lost their naquadah?

34:52.991 --> 34:55.050
Whoa! No, no violence.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.687
No damaging the goods
until we've finished our deal.

34:59.230 --> 35:03.166
Besides, I think the Alliance
wants to hold her up as an example.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.570
Yes, they do.

35:07.539 --> 35:12.499
-Your name?
-Cam Mitchell, bounty hunter.

35:13.611 --> 35:17.240
-Never heard of you.
-That's because I keep a low profile.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.307
I like to let my work speak for itself.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.616
You've partnered with a Jaffa, I see.

35:22.720 --> 35:26.281
Look, we'd love to sit around
and talk shop, but we're on the clock.

35:26.491 --> 35:27.685
Where's our reward?

35:27.792 --> 35:30.488
We have a caseload
of weapons-grade refined naquadah

35:30.595 --> 35:32.222
sitting in our cargo ship.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.662
-Good. Let's go get it.
-No.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.331
I will stay here with you,

35:36.434 --> 35:39.528
while Jup takes Vala and her partner
to the ship.

35:39.671 --> 35:44.267
Once they've been secured, he'll return
and ring the naquadah down to you.

35:45.577 --> 35:48.671
And what's to stop old Jup here
from ringing you away

35:48.780 --> 35:51.112
-and just skedaddling?
-Our honor.

35:51.216 --> 35:53.650
TENAT: It would not be in our best interest
to cheat you.

35:53.751 --> 35:58.245
After all, we have reputations as traders
to uphold.

35:58.423 --> 35:59.583
Right.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.417
Reputations.

36:10.368 --> 36:11.630
Can't help noticing the absence

36:11.736 --> 36:14.671
of the caseload of refined naquadah
you guys were promising.

36:14.772 --> 36:17.866
Do you seriously think the Alliance
would have entrusted us

36:17.976 --> 36:21.207
with another case
after we lost the last one?

36:23.248 --> 36:24.772
So this is a double-cross.

36:24.883 --> 36:27.078
What happened
to upholding your reputations?

36:27.185 --> 36:32.054
Let's just say those bounty hunters won't
be in a position to do any complaining.

36:33.324 --> 36:35.189
(DOOR CLOSING)

36:40.064 --> 36:41.588
-Ow!
-Hold still.

36:45.503 --> 36:46.834
Told you.

37:01.486 --> 37:03.249
So, who do you like in the NFL this year?

37:03.354 --> 37:06.187
You kind of strike me as a Raiders fan.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.251
-Daniel, why don't you let me do it?
-I can do it.

37:11.362 --> 37:14.627
-Just do me a favor. I need some help.
-Okay. What?

37:14.732 --> 37:16.723
Go to the panel by the rear exit.

37:18.970 --> 37:22.406
-Okay. Now what?
-Stay there, shut up and let me finish.

37:25.710 --> 37:29.771
You know, they got a great secondary
and the league's best pass rush.

37:30.148 --> 37:31.115
Offense wins games,

37:31.215 --> 37:33.410
but defense wins championships.
Am I right?

37:33.518 --> 37:35.349
(DRONING)

37:41.926 --> 37:44.326
Our cargo ship has you targeted.

37:44.529 --> 37:46.963
I suggest you lower your weapons.

37:48.032 --> 37:51.195
I take it we're not getting our naquadah.

37:51.469 --> 37:55.769
No, you're not. And so concludes our deal.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.507
(ELECTRICITY SURGING)

38:18.696 --> 38:21.893
Well, that went better than I expected.

38:22.233 --> 38:24.929
I'm picking up ships. Lots of them.

38:30.942 --> 38:34.434
Correction, that went much worse
than I expected.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.375
Stand down and prepare to be boarded.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.050
Shouldn't we be jumping to hyperspace
or something?

38:43.154 --> 38:45.019
They will pursue us.

38:46.357 --> 38:47.483
What are you doing?

38:47.592 --> 38:51.187
Caius said he customized this ship.
Let's see if there's anything we can use.

38:58.936 --> 38:59.903
What's happening?

39:00.004 --> 39:02.404
Multiple energy signatures
of phantom vessels.

39:02.507 --> 39:06.034
-They're confusing the Alliance ships.
-Fine, let's go, let's go, let's go.

39:14.719 --> 39:16.516
There are two vessels pursuing us.

39:16.621 --> 39:18.612
You got anything else
in that bag of tricks?

39:18.723 --> 39:20.088
I'll show you.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.428
What are you doing?

39:35.440 --> 39:36.634
Vala?

39:37.542 --> 39:38.873
Wait for it.

39:43.081 --> 39:44.207
Now.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.218
Wicked.

39:52.723 --> 39:55.920
Pulse wave.
Their power levels spiked and overloaded.

39:56.027 --> 39:59.155
It should take a couple of minutes
to restore primary systems.

39:59.464 --> 40:01.898
Which should give us enough time to...

40:07.939 --> 40:09.406
Thanks for getting my ship back

40:09.707 --> 40:13.871
and for not helping yourself to the swag
in the ship's hidden compartments.

40:15.379 --> 40:17.745
Wait, did you just say
"hidden compartments"?

40:17.849 --> 40:19.976
-Bye-bye.
-No!

40:24.555 --> 40:27.820
So, really, why would you want to trade

40:27.925 --> 40:30.416
a power coil from an obsolete cargo ship?

40:31.262 --> 40:33.253
So, really, why would you want to trade

40:33.364 --> 40:34.922
for this worthless necklace?

40:38.402 --> 40:40.131
-Never mind.
-Never mind.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.578
Excellent.

40:49.514 --> 40:52.074
Finally, I can get Mother off my back.

40:56.988 --> 40:59.354
-So?
-So?

40:59.590 --> 41:01.524
So, we had a deal, remember?

41:01.859 --> 41:04.657
Give you the necklace
and you sever the link.

41:04.996 --> 41:08.557
Yes, yes, of course.
I've been doing extensive research.

41:11.536 --> 41:12.628
And?

41:13.004 --> 41:16.098
Well, there's nothing I can do.
The effect can't be countered.

41:16.440 --> 41:20.467
But, you know, my guess is
it'll wear off eventually on its own.

41:21.879 --> 41:23.870
So long, everybody.

41:30.755 --> 41:31.744
That's it?

41:31.856 --> 41:35.485
-You went through all that for nothing?
-Pretty much.

41:35.593 --> 41:38.255
I can't wait till Senator Fisher
hears about this one.

41:38.362 --> 41:41.820
-Yeah, have you heard any news?
-I spoke to the President.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.798
He gave me two choices.

41:43.901 --> 41:47.393
Accept the budget cuts,
or convince the lnternational Committee

41:47.505 --> 41:51.066
to change their minds
and contribute to our funding.

41:51.542 --> 41:54.033
Right. How do we do that?

41:54.145 --> 41:56.113
Give them what they want.

41:56.314 --> 41:59.579
A new civilian position
appointed by the Committee

41:59.684 --> 42:04.087
with full access to this base
and a say in all major decisions

42:04.188 --> 42:05.917
concerning its operation.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.320
A watchdog?

42:10.061 --> 42:11.255
Exactly.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.771
-Thanks for helping out.
-lndeed.

42:24.075 --> 42:25.770
Good luck on Dakara.

42:33.451 --> 42:35.214
And don't be a stranger.

42:45.796 --> 42:47.058
He'll be back.
