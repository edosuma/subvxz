WEBVTT

05:12.729 --> 05:15.721
Ho-ho!
Cracking job, Gromit.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.681
Hang on, old chum.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.101
What's going on?
Who is it?

05:20.445 --> 05:21.981
Reel him in, lad.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.112
To me. To me.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.490
Gotcha! Thieving monster.

05:33.583 --> 05:37.042
Ooh! Me prize pumpkin.

05:37.128 --> 05:40.871
Me little baby.
Me pride and joy.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.041
You've saved it, Anti-Pesto.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.422
It was nothing
at all, Mrs... Oh!

05:47.138 --> 05:49.300
Everything's under control.
Ah! Oh, no!

05:49.975 --> 05:51.807
Don't worry, madam.
Ahhh!

05:54.855 --> 05:57.017
Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.894
All in a night's work,
Mrs. Mulch.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.817
Ah! Huh?

06:01.903 --> 06:03.894
Cute little feller,
isn't he?

06:03.989 --> 06:06.856
You'd never believe
they'd cause so much damage.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.736
Oh, he may
look innocent, sir.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.034
But left to his own devices,

06:11.121 --> 06:14.614
this is the ultimate
vegetable-destroying machine.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.574
Oh!
Hee!

06:17.669 --> 06:19.410
Reg, me teeth!

06:21.631 --> 06:23.622
Job well done,
lad.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.586
Subject disarmed
and neutralized.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.923
Bless you, Anti-Pesto.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.431
With you out there
protecting our veg,

06:36.521 --> 06:39.809
the most important event
of the year is safe.

06:40.734 --> 06:44.193
Aye. And I hope they give them
pests what's coming to 'em, and all.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.029
Amen to that, Mrs.
Mulch.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.362
Whee!

07:37.791 --> 07:39.122
Whee!

08:04.442 --> 08:06.274
Oh! Whee!

08:11.241 --> 08:14.404
It was a long, hard night
last night, Gromit.

08:14.869 --> 08:18.032
I'll need a good, hearty
breakfast under me belt.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.406
Pile it up, lad.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.911
I'm in the mood for food!

08:26.965 --> 08:29.878
Oh, uh... Gromit, old pal.

08:29.968 --> 08:33.086
It's happened again.
I'll need assistance.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.592
Ow!

08:51.531 --> 08:53.192
Ah. Oh!

08:53.283 --> 08:54.523
Well, thanks, chuck.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.367
I'm sure that hole's
getting smaller.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.487
Ah!

09:00.582 --> 09:04.792
Another successful night.
How are the inmates?

09:05.253 --> 09:07.665
Must be getting
a bit full down there.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.254
Talking of which.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.344
Now, for a great
big plate of...

09:18.141 --> 09:20.007
...vegetables.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.266
<i>Ix-haw!</i>

09:22.353 --> 09:24.936
Still got me
on the diet, eh, Gromit?

09:25.315 --> 09:29.104
Watching me shape?
There's a good dog.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.852
Oh, oh! Uh...

09:31.946 --> 09:33.232
Gromit, lad?

09:33.323 --> 09:36.111
How is that prize marrow
of yours coming on?

09:36.618 --> 09:39.076
Must be a while
since you measured it.

10:06.189 --> 10:11.025
Mmm! Lovely food.
For rabbits, that is.

10:17.367 --> 10:21.531
As for me, I need
something a bit more cheesy.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.705
<i>Ix-haw!</i>

10:31.131 --> 10:33.247
Ooh!

10:36.427 --> 10:38.088
Oh!

10:40.306 --> 10:42.513
Oh!

10:42.600 --> 10:44.716
Caught red-handed, eh, lad?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.688
I'm sorry, Gromit.

10:50.108 --> 10:53.066
I know you're doing this
for my own good,

10:53.570 --> 10:57.438
but the fact is, I'm just
crackers about cheese.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.195
Look, if I must
change me ways,

11:01.286 --> 11:03.402
at least let me do it my way.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.788
With technology.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.748
It's time we tried
my latest invention,

11:12.630 --> 11:16.294
the Mind Manipulation-emetic.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.375
Ha!

11:18.636 --> 11:21.378
It extracts unwanted
thoughts and desires.

11:22.056 --> 11:26.015
I haven't tested it yet,
but it should be perfectly safe.

11:26.644 --> 11:30.228
Just a bit of harmless
brain alteration, that's all.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.734
Uh-oh!

11:39.240 --> 11:43.609
Anti-Pesto Humane Pest Control.
How might we be of assistance?

11:43.786 --> 11:47.324
Ah, yes. Lady Tottington here
of Tottington Hall.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.576
<i>Your Ladyship.</i>

11:48.666 --> 11:50.953
This is an honor.
Oh! Ow!

11:51.336 --> 11:54.829
It's a disaster.
I have the most terrible rabbit problem.

11:54.923 --> 11:58.507
<i>The competition's only days away.
You simply have to do something.</i>

11:58.968 --> 12:02.586
Certainly, ma'am. I think we're
about to go up in the world, lad.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.297
Just stay right where you are,
Your Ladyship,

12:05.391 --> 12:07.382
and we'll be with you
in an...

12:09.145 --> 12:11.853
In an hour?
I can't wait an hour.

12:11.940 --> 12:16.434
I have a major infestation.
Hmm? Hello? Hello?

12:16.527 --> 12:18.017
Hmm.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.353
Ah. That's more like it.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.737
Thank goodness you've... Oh.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.786
What ho!
For you, my love.

12:29.791 --> 12:33.500
Victor. How lovely and...
unexpected.

12:33.711 --> 12:37.045
Heard you had a spot of rabbit
bother and tootled straight on over

12:37.215 --> 12:38.751
to sort the blighters out.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.424
Gosh, that's awfully
sweet of you.

12:41.511 --> 12:42.967
But you really needn't bother.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.715
It's no bother,
little boo-boo.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.888
It's the least a chap
can do for his filly.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.517
Don't want pests spoiling our
beautiful manor house, do we?

12:50.603 --> 12:52.093
"Our" manor house?

12:52.730 --> 12:55.438
No one's mentioned
marriage, Victor.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.643
All in good time, my dear.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.773
Vermin first, though,
what what.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.194
Come on, Phillip.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.772
Victor!

13:03.866 --> 13:06.574
We can deal
with this humanely.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.409
Oh-ho! Very classy.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.870
Just the sort of client we
should be dealing with, eh, lad?

13:26.097 --> 13:27.212
Oh.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.265
Burrowing bounders!

13:31.936 --> 13:33.927
They must be breeding like...

13:34.564 --> 13:36.305
...well, rabbits.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.063
Only one thing for it, lad.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.529
Victor, hadn't we agreed?
Hmm.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.860
No more thoughtless killing.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.445
Quite right, my dear.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.998
So I've thought this one
through very carefully.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.166
It's off to bunny heaven
for you, big ears.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.994
Victor! No!

14:01.049 --> 14:03.006
Ah!
What the...

14:16.981 --> 14:19.348
Champion sucker,
eh, Gromit?

14:20.777 --> 14:23.235
The BunVac 6000.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.571
Wheel

14:27.158 --> 14:29.525
This'll impress Her Ladyship.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.907
I don't understand. It should
have been a bull's-eye.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.580
Oh, Victor. I felt
we'd made a real breakthrough

14:35.666 --> 14:39.204
with this hunting obsession of yours.
I really thought you'd changed.

14:39.462 --> 14:43.547
I'm sorry, Campanula,
but I am what I am.

14:44.342 --> 14:47.050
There's no nonsense
with Victor Quartermaine.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.377
What you see is what you get.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.846
What the...

14:56.979 --> 14:59.971
Sounds like
a really big brute, this one.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.852
Give it some more welly.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.279
Gosh!

15:17.834 --> 15:20.417
Maybe I should've
used a bigger nozzle.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.160
Oh!

15:22.255 --> 15:25.213
Anti-Pesto, you're here.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.295
Oh!

15:28.219 --> 15:30.005
Your Ladyship.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.471
My darlings!

15:36.477 --> 15:37.808
You're safe.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.895
- Oh.
- My word!

15:40.982 --> 15:44.600
What a fabulous job you've done.
And not a single one harmed.

15:44.819 --> 15:47.777
Ah, the old BV6000, ma'am.

15:48.072 --> 15:52.441
Capable of 125 RPM.
That's "rabbits per minute."

15:52.535 --> 15:54.526
How inspired!

15:54.912 --> 15:56.494
Mister...
Oh, Wallace.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.158
Mr. Wallace.
Mmm.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.578
Oh.
Is this all of them?

16:00.793 --> 16:04.536
Uh, just one left.
Hoist her up, Gromit.

16:14.432 --> 16:18.346
Victor, stop fooling around
in the dirt and have a look at this.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.643
The ingenious Anti-Pesto

16:20.730 --> 16:23.438
have completely dealt
with my rabbit problem.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.606
Isn't it marvelous?
Marvelous?

16:25.902 --> 16:26.937
"Marvelous"?

16:27.195 --> 16:30.608
This confounded contraption
virtually suffocated me!

16:31.782 --> 16:35.275
Besides, the job's
only half done.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.657
How do you intend
to finish these vermin off?

16:38.748 --> 16:40.785
Crush 'em?
Liquidize 'em?

16:40.875 --> 16:44.084
They're humane.
"Humane"?

16:44.378 --> 16:49.464
Well, then perhaps they'd be humane
enough to give me back my dignity.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.003
I want...

16:55.306 --> 16:57.138
Toupee, please.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.474
Oh, grand. Uh,
we take check or cash.

17:00.561 --> 17:04.599
"Toupee," you idiot!
My hair is in your machine.

17:04.941 --> 17:08.275
Oh, no,
it's only rabbits in there.

17:08.486 --> 17:11.523
The hare, I think you'll find,
is a much larger mammal.

17:11.614 --> 17:12.900
Out of my way, fool.

17:18.287 --> 17:22.030
I'm sorry, my dear, but I refuse
to suffer any further humiliation

17:22.124 --> 17:24.616
at the hands of these
blundering nitwits.

17:24.919 --> 17:27.001
I therefore bid you good day.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.337
Thank you for ridding
me of a real problem, Mr. Wallace.

17:37.431 --> 17:41.174
Tell me, what exactly will you
do with all these rabbits?

17:41.269 --> 17:42.600
Oh, uh...

17:42.687 --> 17:44.428
Trade secret.

17:44.522 --> 17:48.516
Yes. I'd be happy to let them roam
free if it wasn't for the competition.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.316
But they do so love their veg.

17:50.611 --> 17:54.354
It's in their little bunny natures, and
you can't change that, can you?

17:54.448 --> 17:55.688
No.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.782
Or can you?

18:06.002 --> 18:08.664
Why didn't we think of it
before, lad?

18:10.006 --> 18:13.965
The solution to all our storage problems.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.964
Simply by connecting
the BunVac

18:17.638 --> 18:20.471
to the Mind
Manipulation-emetic,

18:21.058 --> 18:23.265
we can brainwash the bunnies.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.936
Rabbit rehabilitation.

18:29.191 --> 18:33.560
Once cured of their antisocial
veg-ravaging behavior,

18:34.363 --> 18:38.482
the rabbits can be safely released
without fear of re-offending.

18:39.827 --> 18:44.412
Just a little added lunar power
to enhance the mind waves...

18:50.379 --> 18:52.416
...and we can begin.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.672
Veg, bad.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.838
Veg, bad.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.595
Veg, bad.

19:06.437 --> 19:09.350
Say no to carrots,

19:09.440 --> 19:12.933
cabbage and cauliflower.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.529
Well, come on, lad,
what are you waiting for?

19:18.616 --> 19:20.357
Turn on the BunVac.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.816
Full suction.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.492
Ah.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.630
It's working, Gromit.
Oh! It's working!

19:39.720 --> 19:41.006
Ho-ho!

19:44.266 --> 19:46.223
Their tiny bunny brains

19:46.310 --> 19:50.645
are being saturated
in my veg-free mind waves.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.098
- Huh?
- Huh?

19:53.609 --> 19:56.317
Another 30 minutes'
brainwashing should suffice.

19:56.404 --> 19:59.271
Then we can move on
to the conditioning.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.159
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

20:12.670 --> 20:14.001
Gromit!

20:15.923 --> 20:17.254
Switch it off!

20:17.591 --> 20:19.002
Wheel
Get it off!

20:20.678 --> 20:22.339
Get it off me, lad!

20:35.860 --> 20:38.022
Oh, thanks, lad.

20:45.703 --> 20:46.818
Quick.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.277
Give us a carrot.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.415
Ugh.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.214
Ah! It worked, Gromit!

21:00.551 --> 21:02.588
A reformed rabbit.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.879
We'll call him Hutch.
Shall we?

21:06.682 --> 21:08.798
Come on.
Let's get the kettle on.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.850
We'll see to him
in the morning.

21:14.398 --> 21:19.063
Ho-ho! I feel we're on the cusp
of a real breakthrough, lad.

21:22.406 --> 21:27.025
Mankind freed from
rabbit problems forever.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.449
Lady Tottington
will be impressed.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.672
Good night.

22:28.722 --> 22:29.962
Sleep tight.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.557
And don't let
the bedbugs bite.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.319
Good night, Gromit.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.284
Sweet dreams, old chum.

23:18.480 --> 23:23.145
Protect and nourish the
frail and the weak, 0 Lord.

23:23.444 --> 23:28.029
Let them grow big and strong
under Thy loving care.

23:28.365 --> 23:32.780
In fact, let them grow bigger
and stronger than anyone else's,

23:32.870 --> 23:35.703
so that the first prize
might be mine.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.747
Amen.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.668
A harvest offering
to bind the deal.

23:43.505 --> 23:47.499
<i>We plow the fields
and scatter the good seed on...</i>

23:47.593 --> 23:49.129
Huh?

23:53.766 --> 23:54.756
Hmm.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.359
<i>He sends the snow
in Winter...</i>

24:22.586 --> 24:24.748
<i>All good gifts around us'</i>

24:24.838 --> 24:25.999
<i>Are sent from...</i>

24:28.425 --> 24:29.586
Heavens above.

24:30.636 --> 24:31.717
Hello?

24:35.099 --> 24:38.262
Hello? Is anybody there?

24:42.439 --> 24:43.725
Mrs. Mulch?

24:45.442 --> 24:48.309
Please, come forward, whoever you are.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.691
There's no need to be afraid.

24:53.325 --> 24:59.162
Ah! You're hungry.
Then please, take what you like.

24:59.248 --> 25:02.081
It is for the needy,
after all.

25:07.923 --> 25:10.631
No! No! No! No!

25:12.386 --> 25:14.218
Mercy!

25:16.640 --> 25:17.675
Ah!

26:18.327 --> 26:19.658
Morning, Gromit.

26:23.707 --> 26:28.122
A pest-free night per...
chance?

26:31.924 --> 26:33.164
Whoa.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.499
Lumme day.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.133
It's a disaster.
Me garden's ruined.

26:40.224 --> 26:43.057
It's carnage out there.
Where were Anti-Pesto?

26:43.143 --> 26:45.680
Simmer down.
Simmer down, now.

26:46.146 --> 26:50.014
Right. One at a time,
if ya please.

26:50.150 --> 26:53.063
We paid good money
for our crop protection.

26:53.153 --> 26:57.272
If ya can't deliver the goods,
maybe you should keep your traps shut.

26:57.407 --> 27:01.492
Oh, I never saw
such cauliflower carnage.

27:01.578 --> 27:04.491
Worse than the
Great Slug Blight of '32,

27:05.082 --> 27:08.325
when there were slugs
the size of pigs.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.625
Growbag's right.
The slugs are back!

27:10.963 --> 27:12.169
The slugs are back!

27:12.506 --> 27:14.543
That's enough!
That's enough!

27:15.384 --> 27:19.127
Look, this flippin'
vegetable competition

27:19.221 --> 27:22.054
causes nothin' but trouble every year.
Here we go.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.181
- If ya ask me...
- Get on with ya!

27:24.268 --> 27:29.138
Know what? I'll tell ya.
If ya ask me, this was arson.

27:29.273 --> 27:30.763
Arson?
Aye!

27:30.858 --> 27:33.520
Someone "arsin'" around.

27:33.610 --> 27:36.728
That's right.
One of you lot. A man.

27:37.114 --> 27:39.276
This was no man.

27:43.787 --> 27:46.199
Does a man have teeth

27:46.290 --> 27:49.123
the size of ax blades?

27:53.297 --> 27:56.506
Or ears like
terrible tombstones?

27:59.136 --> 28:01.548
By tampering with nature,

28:01.638 --> 28:06.348
forcing vegetables to swell
far beyond their natural size,

28:06.435 --> 28:10.895
we have brought a terrible
judgment upon ourselves.

28:13.317 --> 28:15.058
Hey! Give over!

28:18.822 --> 28:19.857
Mental.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.563
And for our sins,

28:21.658 --> 28:24.992
a hideous creature has
been sent to punish us all!

28:25.746 --> 28:27.703
Repent! Repent!

28:27.998 --> 28:31.366
Lest you too,
taste the wrath of...

28:32.669 --> 28:35.127
...the Were-Rabbit!

28:37.174 --> 28:40.883
This is terrible!
What's going to happen to us?

28:40.969 --> 28:43.131
Doomed!
Who's going to help us?

28:43.222 --> 28:46.385
What's to become of the vegetable show?
We live for that competition.

28:46.475 --> 28:49.137
Get off me. We're simple folk.
It's all we have.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.434
Who will save us?
Get... Hey!

28:53.190 --> 28:55.272
A were-rabbit?

28:55.484 --> 28:56.690
Oh, come, come, now.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.943
I do believe the Vicar's been
to the communion wine again.

29:03.033 --> 29:06.901
What we are dealing with here
is no supernatural rabbit.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.783
It's a big fellow, perhaps.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.661
But a mortal creature of flesh and blood.

29:12.876 --> 29:16.790
A matter easily dealt with by a hunter.

29:16.880 --> 29:20.123
Guns will not be necessary,
thank you, Victor.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.926
Hasn't there been
enough destruction?

29:26.265 --> 29:29.348
I believe the killing
of fluffy creatures

29:29.518 --> 29:31.259
is never justified.

29:31.395 --> 29:35.184
I say we give Anti-Pesto
a second chance.

29:35.899 --> 29:39.984
What? How on Earth would
those tiny-minded buffoons

29:40.070 --> 29:42.983
ever catch
such a big rabbit?

29:43.532 --> 29:44.738
Mr. Wallace?

29:46.034 --> 29:47.195
Oh!

29:47.286 --> 29:48.276
Oh...

29:51.665 --> 29:53.406
Ooh, well...

29:57.838 --> 29:59.454
With a big trap.

30:00.048 --> 30:03.211
By Jove. He's...
He's got it!

30:03.427 --> 30:04.883
Genius!
Genius!

30:05.012 --> 30:06.377
Brilliant.
What a great idea!

30:06.471 --> 30:08.712
Hmm. Clever.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.011
You see, Victor,

30:12.269 --> 30:14.977
there's hope
for the vegetables yet.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.730
Not the ones I'm looking at.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.101
That's me boys!

30:30.746 --> 30:31.076
Ah! Love, Gromit.

30:31.079 --> 30:34.492
Ah! Love, Gromit.

30:34.583 --> 30:37.371
That's the biggest
trap of all.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.413
The "tender trap,"
they call it.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.413
And that's what we'll use
to catch this thing.

30:42.966 --> 30:47.426
Yes, lad, a lovely
lady rabbit.

30:50.474 --> 30:54.263
How could any hot-blooded
rabbit-beast resist?

31:04.154 --> 31:05.986
Oh, come on, Gromit.

31:06.073 --> 31:10.283
A bit more,
you know, alluring.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.951
Ho-ho!

31:17.501 --> 31:19.083
Very cheeky.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.458
Ha-ha!

31:27.761 --> 31:29.593
That's more like it, lad.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.508
How can we possibly
fail now?

31:33.225 --> 31:35.341
You're a total knockout.

31:37.687 --> 31:39.473
Oops!

31:44.820 --> 31:46.276
Stick around, lad.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.692
Should fix back
on quite easily.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.370
Nighty-night,
me lovelies.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.418
Think big now.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.890
No!

36:01.117 --> 36:03.859
Don't worry.
No. No.

36:03.953 --> 36:06.240
Well, I'm very sorry,
Mrs. Mulch.

36:06.331 --> 36:09.540
We'll get there as soon as we can.
Mr. Dibber. Oh, yes.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.334
Can I call you back?
Mrs. Girdling.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.288
A tunnel <i>you</i> say?
<i>What do you intend to do about this?</i>

36:15.382 --> 36:16.588
Oh! I'll look into it.

36:18.134 --> 36:19.920
So where did you get to, lad?

36:20.011 --> 36:22.343
I thought I told you
to stay put.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.341
It's gone mad around here.

36:24.974 --> 36:27.591
I thought we were
supposed to be a team.

36:28.812 --> 36:30.974
How are we ever
gonna catch this thing

36:31.064 --> 36:33.977
if you go gallivanting off
on your own all the time?

36:34.484 --> 36:36.896
You're doing it again!

36:37.404 --> 36:39.315
Where are you going now?

36:40.240 --> 36:41.321
Gromit!

36:43.451 --> 36:44.612
Gromit!

36:47.288 --> 36:48.494
Really, lad.

36:48.581 --> 36:52.165
You do realize I've made a personal
promise to Lady Tottington.

36:52.836 --> 36:55.373
How is this sort of behavior
going to get us

36:55.463 --> 36:58.831
any nearer to finding
a rabbit-monster?

37:05.557 --> 37:06.763
Hutch.

37:09.310 --> 37:10.675
Oh, Gromit.

37:11.354 --> 37:13.937
We've created a monster.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.606
Hutch is the beast.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.944
The lunar panels.

37:22.323 --> 37:27.489
They must've over-stimulated
Hutch's primitive bunny nature.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.241
And now,
when the moon appears,

37:30.331 --> 37:34.290
he undergoes
a hideous transformation.

37:36.963 --> 37:39.204
Huh?

37:50.351 --> 37:51.807
Oh, Gromit.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.555
Oh.

37:54.314 --> 37:57.682
Oh, this is absolutely...

37:59.569 --> 38:01.560
...fantastic!

38:02.238 --> 38:03.774
Don't you see, lad?

38:03.865 --> 38:07.574
Okay, so we've created
a veg-ravaging rabbit-monster.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.698
But we've also captured it.

38:11.247 --> 38:13.579
Just like I promised
Lady Tottington.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.870
I'll go and tell her
the good news.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.957
Make sure he doesn't escape.

38:19.547 --> 38:20.753
Bye!

39:56.561 --> 39:57.767
Mr. Wallace.

39:57.896 --> 40:01.764
It's the beast, Your Ladyship.
I bring great news.

40:01.858 --> 40:05.522
Gosh, how exciting.
Please, do come in.

40:18.124 --> 40:20.707
Well, this is
simply spiffing news.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.416
With the beast in captivity,

40:22.670 --> 40:24.786
the competition can
go ahead as planned.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.501
You saved the day,
Mr. Wallace.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.799
It was nothing,
Your Ladyship.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.881
So modest.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.924
Oh, please,
do help yourself.

40:34.390 --> 40:35.596
Oh!

40:35.683 --> 40:36.844
Thanks.

40:39.020 --> 40:43.309
I so appreciate you coming all
this way to let me know, Wallace.

40:43.399 --> 40:46.187
Tell me, are you
a vegetable-lover yourself?

40:46.319 --> 40:49.687
They're... growing on me.
Then come with me.

40:50.031 --> 40:53.569
There's something very special
I want to show you.

40:54.953 --> 40:55.988
Oh!

41:01.876 --> 41:02.957
Hop in.

41:04.379 --> 41:07.542
It's very snug.
It's my Jacob's ladder.

41:09.550 --> 41:12.588
And it goes
all the way to heaven.

41:22.105 --> 41:25.268
Welcome to my
inner sanctum, Wallace.

41:26.651 --> 41:29.518
My secret garden. Hmm!

41:29.946 --> 41:32.278
It's a veritable,

41:32.907 --> 41:36.116
vegetable paradise.

41:36.369 --> 41:38.451
I just knew you'd love it.

41:38.913 --> 41:40.369
Unlike Victor.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.365
He's never shown
any interest in my produce.

41:43.459 --> 41:47.168
Oh! His loss, Lady Tottington.
Please, Wallace.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.378
Call me "Totty."

42:01.477 --> 42:03.764
If anything were
to happen to my vegetables,

42:03.855 --> 42:05.391
I don't know what I'd do.

42:05.565 --> 42:07.727
I'm sure you understand,
Mr. Wallace.

42:08.151 --> 42:10.483
I can see that you're
a true nature lover.

42:10.653 --> 42:12.519
Oh, yes. Yes, lam.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.776
At first,
I thought I could change Victor.

42:15.992 --> 42:18.780
Now I'm not so sure.
Oh!

42:19.662 --> 42:21.653
Do you think a man
can change, Wallace?

42:21.914 --> 42:23.075
Change? Oh!

42:23.624 --> 42:24.955
Oh, yes.

42:30.423 --> 42:33.711
Really, Phillip.
The things one does for love.

42:42.602 --> 42:43.933
Pesto.

42:46.189 --> 42:48.476
- Mr. Wallace.
- Oh, Totty.

42:49.525 --> 42:51.391
"Totty"?

42:56.324 --> 42:58.440
I'd like to show you
one last thing.

42:58.534 --> 43:02.152
Something no other man
has ever seen.

43:02.246 --> 43:03.361
Oh!

43:04.123 --> 43:06.455
My carrot de Chantenay.

43:07.877 --> 43:09.459
Just smell it, Wallace.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.287
Feel its silken flesh.
Oh, yes.

43:12.381 --> 43:16.295
Isn't it the most sumptuous,
succulent specimen you've ever seen?

43:16.385 --> 43:18.467
Yes!
Doesn't it fill your heart

43:18.554 --> 43:19.715
- with desire?
- Yes!

43:19.806 --> 43:22.514
Just imagine
what it would taste like.

43:28.481 --> 43:31.269
What on Earth
were you thinkin' of, lad?

43:31.442 --> 43:35.401
Ruined a perfectly good piece of
fashionable knitwear, that did.

43:35.530 --> 43:39.023
To say nothing of a relationship
with an important client.

43:41.410 --> 43:44.493
It's lucky for us Her Ladyship
was so understanding.

43:46.666 --> 43:49.829
Honestly, I don't know
what's got into you lately.

43:49.919 --> 43:52.331
And slow down
for pity's sake.

43:52.421 --> 43:54.162
You'll buckle me trunnions.

43:58.803 --> 43:59.918
Hmm?

44:01.305 --> 44:03.216
Don't worry.
I'll see to this.

44:04.183 --> 44:07.596
You stay here where you belong.
In the doghouse.

44:12.233 --> 44:13.314
Right.

44:17.155 --> 44:18.896
It's heavier than it looks.

44:28.749 --> 44:30.956
I know your
little secret, Pesto.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.702
I know exactly what's going on.
Your Lordship...

44:34.005 --> 44:36.542
Oh, yes. You think you can
pilfer my filly, don't you?

44:37.800 --> 44:40.087
You think you can con an innocent
woman out of her fortune?

44:40.303 --> 44:42.886
Who, me?
Well, I got here first!

44:43.181 --> 44:46.469
I've spent along time reeling
in that fluffy-headed bunny-lover.

44:46.559 --> 44:47.890
And I'm not
about to let some

44:47.977 --> 44:50.218
puddle-headed peasant
poach her from me.

44:50.313 --> 44:52.930
<i>Comprenez?</i>
Oh, uh, right-o.

44:53.024 --> 44:54.981
I'll be off then. Ta-ta.

44:56.652 --> 44:59.235
You're not going
anywhere, Pesto.

45:00.281 --> 45:02.022
Ow!

45:02.116 --> 45:05.234
Not until I've taught you
a jolly good lesson.

45:08.998 --> 45:10.739
Come on! Queensberry rules!

45:10.833 --> 45:12.870
Put 'em up,
ya little pipsqueak.

45:15.755 --> 45:17.166
You're shaking.

45:17.924 --> 45:21.588
Don't tell me you're a scaredy-cat
as well as a scoundrel.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.973
And don't think acting
like a big girl's blouse

45:29.060 --> 45:30.300
will get you out of it.

45:30.394 --> 45:32.681
There's no mercy
with Victor Quartermaine.

45:33.856 --> 45:34.846
Huh?

45:34.941 --> 45:35.976
Huh?

45:51.207 --> 45:52.789
What the dickens?

45:57.838 --> 45:59.249
What on Earth...

46:06.264 --> 46:07.254
Ooh!

46:40.756 --> 46:42.667
Phillip! Attack!

46:42.842 --> 46:44.082
Attack!

46:46.721 --> 46:48.211
What the...

47:11.787 --> 47:12.902
Hmm?

47:42.777 --> 47:43.812
Vicar!

47:44.362 --> 47:47.024
Vicar! Oh,
where the devil is he?

47:47.365 --> 47:48.696
Do you want to confess?

47:48.824 --> 47:50.906
I want to talk to you about...

47:51.911 --> 47:54.448
...the beast.

47:55.539 --> 47:58.952
Everything you need to know
is in this book.

48:01.253 --> 48:05.292
"Nun Wrestling." No.
I meant this one.

48:15.267 --> 48:16.382
Huh.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.101
Ugh.

48:20.481 --> 48:22.313
Ha!

48:22.858 --> 48:24.098
Here it is.

48:24.318 --> 48:28.403
The hideous monster
plaguing our parish.

48:28.989 --> 48:31.651
The Were-Rabbit.

48:34.036 --> 48:35.197
So it's true.

48:35.663 --> 48:38.621
The beast lurks
within all of us, my child.

48:39.291 --> 48:44.206
The side that emerges at night
as the moon rises into the sky.

48:44.296 --> 48:47.539
The side that
savagely rips the leaves

48:47.633 --> 48:49.624
off any innocent cabbage.

48:49.718 --> 48:51.300
Spare me the sermon, Vicar.

48:51.679 --> 48:55.013
- Just tell me how I kill him.
- I mean "it."

48:55.850 --> 48:57.761
To kill such a creature

48:57.977 --> 49:00.594
would require
nerves of steel

49:00.855 --> 49:02.016
and...

49:03.607 --> 49:05.348
...a bullet.

49:05.860 --> 49:07.942
A bullet?

49:08.446 --> 49:10.107
A bullet.

49:10.448 --> 49:12.485
A bull... Oh!

49:13.367 --> 49:15.449
What kind of bullet?

49:15.536 --> 49:19.370
A bullet of pure gold.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.081
Gold.

49:26.255 --> 49:27.290
Yes.

49:28.174 --> 49:30.791
Twenty-four karat.

49:31.302 --> 49:32.918
Oh!

49:33.012 --> 49:34.502
Get out of my way.

49:35.473 --> 49:36.963
Silly, old fool.

49:37.308 --> 49:41.768
Beware! Beware of the beast within!

50:33.072 --> 50:34.233
<i>Nee-heel!</i>

50:35.616 --> 50:36.856
Ha-ha!

50:36.951 --> 50:39.283
Perfect re-entry, Gromit.

50:39.370 --> 50:42.203
This veg diet's
doing the trick, eh, lad?

50:42.289 --> 50:44.200
I feel smashing.

50:44.750 --> 50:46.411
Mmm.

50:46.877 --> 50:50.711
So how's our
rabbit-monster, hmm?

50:52.216 --> 50:54.082
Hope you're keeping
an eye on him.

51:01.892 --> 51:02.927
Hmm.

51:04.061 --> 51:05.176
Uh...

51:05.271 --> 51:06.727
What's up, dog?

51:14.488 --> 51:16.195
Well, fancy that.

51:16.282 --> 51:17.568
Rabbit ears.

51:18.617 --> 51:20.107
That is a bit odd.

51:24.373 --> 51:26.410
And what are you
tryin' to say, lad?

51:29.712 --> 51:30.952
What?

51:31.046 --> 51:32.332
What?

51:32.965 --> 51:35.627
What? You think
that I'm the...

51:38.012 --> 51:39.548
Because of these?

51:39.638 --> 51:41.003
Oh, no.

51:41.307 --> 51:43.844
No. This is just a reaction

51:43.934 --> 51:46.551
to that healthy veg diet
you've got me on.

51:47.021 --> 51:49.262
It's the toxins coming out.

51:49.565 --> 51:51.897
Silly, old pooch.

51:51.984 --> 51:53.895
Thinking I'm the beast.

51:55.863 --> 51:58.025
Next thing you'll be saying

51:58.115 --> 52:00.823
is that Hutch
is turning into me.

52:04.997 --> 52:07.785
Hey.
What are you doing, lad?

52:08.334 --> 52:10.325
Have you gone completely mad?

52:16.675 --> 52:19.383
Cheese!

52:21.013 --> 52:22.378
"Cheese"?

52:35.194 --> 52:36.229
Huh?

52:53.337 --> 52:54.498
Ooh!

52:54.588 --> 52:58.331
I do like
a bit of Gorgonzola.

53:02.805 --> 53:05.012
Oh, dear.

53:08.519 --> 53:09.975
Perfect.
Ma'am.

53:10.604 --> 53:12.595
Now, let's see.
Coming through!

53:14.274 --> 53:15.856
The tombola's arrived.

53:15.943 --> 53:18.901
And the bouncy
Tottington Hall.

53:19.363 --> 53:20.569
Splendid.

53:24.618 --> 53:27.360
Oh, it's going to be such
a jolly competition tonight.

53:27.621 --> 53:28.702
I just know it.

53:28.831 --> 53:31.698
Ya don't know nothin'.
What?

53:31.792 --> 53:34.409
The beast has struck again.
That's what.

53:35.629 --> 53:37.370
That's right!

53:37.548 --> 53:39.630
No, you're quite mistaken,
Mrs. Mulch.

53:39.717 --> 53:42.084
The beast is in captivity.
Oh, yeah?

53:42.177 --> 53:45.966
Then just take a look at my
wife's brassicas.

53:46.056 --> 53:49.014
Ravaged in the night.
But I don't understand.

53:49.101 --> 53:51.684
Anti-Pesto told me...
A pack of lies!

53:51.770 --> 53:54.558
It's not safe to bring
our vegetables here.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.639
The show's off.

53:59.403 --> 54:01.610
But this is simply
dreadful news.

54:03.240 --> 54:07.108
The Tottingtons have held
a giant vegetable competition

54:07.202 --> 54:10.991
on this very night
for over 500 years.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.321
That's right.

54:13.167 --> 54:17.661
Not even the Great Duck Plague
of '53 stopped it.

54:18.839 --> 54:20.000
Oh.

54:20.090 --> 54:22.172
If only there were
another way.

54:24.344 --> 54:26.255
What ho!

54:27.097 --> 54:28.508
It's Quartermaine.

54:28.599 --> 54:30.761
Heard you had
a spot of rabbit bother.

54:39.359 --> 54:41.020
Didn't this bit used to...

54:43.489 --> 54:45.321
Now. Now, let's see.

54:45.407 --> 54:46.863
Uh...

54:47.951 --> 54:50.409
Oh, where does this part go?

54:54.124 --> 54:55.205
Oh!

55:01.048 --> 55:02.129
Huh?

55:02.216 --> 55:04.082
Oh, it's hopeless.

55:04.176 --> 55:06.793
I'll never fix this
flippin' machine. Oh!

55:06.887 --> 55:09.549
Me mind's just
a rabbit-y mush.

55:09.640 --> 55:12.098
Oh, Gromit.

55:12.643 --> 55:16.682
I don't wanna
be a giant rabbit!

55:20.234 --> 55:21.599
Oh!

55:21.693 --> 55:24.811
The bounce is gone
from his bungee.

55:37.167 --> 55:42.003
Hey, Pesto!
Rabbit rehabilitation.

55:42.965 --> 55:45.548
But if I can't fix it...

55:46.552 --> 55:47.838
Cheddar.

55:47.928 --> 55:50.386
...maybe the other me can!

55:50.472 --> 55:52.258
I'm inventing, mostly.

55:52.558 --> 55:56.176
Look at me go! Ho-ho!
I'm a genius.

55:57.980 --> 56:01.848
Oh, heck! I can't answer the door.
Not like this.

56:02.484 --> 56:04.691
Charming. I'm Wallace.

56:05.070 --> 56:06.936
I already am!

56:07.823 --> 56:08.813
Hutch!

56:12.202 --> 56:14.034
Geronimo!

56:14.121 --> 56:15.452
Huh? Wallace?

56:15.539 --> 56:17.780
Uh, hang on a Mo'.

56:19.668 --> 56:20.658
Wallace?

56:20.752 --> 56:24.086
Hello? I say.
Open this door at once.

56:26.008 --> 56:27.373
Oh!

56:27.467 --> 56:28.753
Totty.

56:29.052 --> 56:32.010
Uh, "Lady Tottington,"
if you don't mind.

56:32.556 --> 56:35.139
Oh. I'm afraid I have some
rather bad news, Wallace.

56:35.225 --> 56:37.717
Thing is, well,

56:37.811 --> 56:42.180
you've rather let me down with
this beastly beast business.

56:42.274 --> 56:44.891
I suppose I have.
Yes.

56:44.985 --> 56:47.727
It's obvious to me that
you have absolutely no idea

56:47.821 --> 56:49.437
where this poor creature is.

56:49.531 --> 56:52.148
And I'm afraid
you've given me no option

56:52.242 --> 56:55.576
but to let Victor
shoot the poor thing.

56:56.121 --> 56:57.862
Shoot it?

56:58.832 --> 57:01.494
Yes.
Wasn't an easy choice,

57:01.585 --> 57:03.917
but the veg competition
has to come first.

57:04.004 --> 57:07.338
Besides, Victor's
promised me it won't suffer.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.665
It will be quick and painless.

57:09.760 --> 57:12.001
How thoughtful.

57:12.095 --> 57:14.928
I cannot deny it was
a difficult decision for me.

57:15.015 --> 57:17.632
Because I've recently
developed...

57:17.726 --> 57:18.716
Hurry!

57:20.228 --> 57:21.514
...feelings for you.

57:21.897 --> 57:24.935
Feelings?
Oh, well, never mind, eh?

57:25.025 --> 57:27.642
Ta-Ra, then.
Wait! Wallace.

57:27.736 --> 57:30.478
I haven't finished yet. There's so
much more that needs to be said.

57:30.572 --> 57:32.779
Well, I'll give you a tinkle,
shall I?

57:33.033 --> 57:35.491
Can't we at least shake hands?
Part as friends?

57:35.577 --> 57:38.035
It's not very convenient
at the moment.

57:38.121 --> 57:39.611
Thanks for coming by.

57:40.290 --> 57:42.782
Well, I... I...

57:58.433 --> 58:00.640
That's right,
my lovely.

58:00.727 --> 58:04.516
You can say goodbye
to your fluffy lover-boy.

58:08.443 --> 58:10.229
You gotta help me, Gromit!

58:10.362 --> 58:11.944
Hide me. Anything.

58:12.155 --> 58:14.146
Before it's too late!

58:14.241 --> 58:15.731
Lad!

58:15.826 --> 58:17.487
Your Lordship.

58:45.731 --> 58:46.721
Ooh!

58:49.026 --> 58:50.858
Good night, Gromit.

59:01.121 --> 59:02.156
Huh?

59:43.663 --> 59:45.745
'Tis done.

59:49.711 --> 59:52.419
My poor sensitive child.

59:52.506 --> 59:57.751
Allow us all to share
in your moment of sorrow.

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:04.014
Yeah!

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:08.268
On with the show!

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.735
Huh? What the...

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:27.029
Why you...

01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:42.294
Of course.

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:45.639
The vegetable competition.

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:49.343
Your loyalty is moving.

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:52.521
Sadly, you won't be.

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:53.847
Come along, Phillip.

01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:56.650
Everyone's been looking
forward to a good show.

01:00:57.112 --> 01:00:59.149
Let's see they get one.

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:32.098
Hooray!
Mr. Growbag.

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:37.357
I... I have a hunch this'll be
a night to remember.

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.442
I just have a hunch.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:42.692
<i>All right. All right.
If we must do this flipping veg show,</i>

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:45.615
<i>let's do it in an orderly
and law-abiding fashion.</i>

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.443
<i>Cucumbers,
give way to marrows.</i>

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.619
<i>Carrots, wait your turn!</i>

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:52.368
<i>Aubergines...</i>
A-ha! There's our bait, Phillip.

01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:56.453
All we have to do now is wait
for our fluffy friend to appear.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:01.499
Look over here, everyone!
It's Victor!

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.297
He's here!
Our hero.

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:05.923
Please, sir, kiss my baby.

01:02:06.014 --> 01:02:08.255
Another time, perhaps.
Kiss my potato.

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:10.967
Not now.
Kiss my artichoke.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.472
Look, just...
Victor.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.269
Campanula!

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:18.850
Victor, I have to know.
Did it suffer?

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:22.437
Of course not, my dear.
Not yet, anyway.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.821
Victor?
<i>Oi, you.</i>

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:27.195
Constable.
<i>Careful with them capsicums.</i>

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:31.616
Listen, I don't want to cause panic,
but the beast isn't actually dead yet.

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:34.573
<i>The beast isn't actually dead yet?
What?</i>

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:45.793
<i>Oops.</i>

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:48.675
To the competition stand!

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:07.190
Cracking toast,
Gromit.

01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:12.703
I'm just crackers
about cheese.

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:17.412
Monterey Jack. Ooh!

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:32.635
Smashing Wensleydale.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:36.885
Whoa!

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:49.315
Ooh!

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:56.246
Job well done, lad.

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:15.891
Quiet!

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.392
Quiet!

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:23.648
Now, listen carefully.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:25.980
I've only got two...

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:29.567
I've only got
one gold bullet left.

01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:32.069
So leave this to me.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.118
Yes, all right, I admit
the beast is still at large.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:39.119
But the good news is your prize
vegetables are the perfect bait...

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:40.577
"Bait"?

01:04:40.668 --> 01:04:41.908
...and will draw
the creature like a magnet.

01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:43.493
But you must keep perfectly still...
My baby.

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:44.578
Don't finch...

01:04:44.672 --> 01:04:48.461
There, there, love. It'll be all...
Huh? Don't even move a muscle.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.087
Mrs. Mulch! No!

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:53.094
It's not getting my baby!

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:59.059
Lovely food.
For rabbits, that is.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.392
Come back!
Come back!

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:14.570
Yes. Right on cue.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:18.199
Come back!

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:20.910
Come back!

01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:24.118
Go away!

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:27.204
That's right.
Come to Uncle Victor.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.920
It's coming for us!

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:44.604
Bingo.

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:47.933
What the...

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.106
Hurrah for Anti-Pesto!

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.818
It's getting away!
Get off, you stupid...

01:05:57.912 --> 01:05:59.027
No!

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:08.036
Vicar, I need
more gold bullets.

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:09.963
They don't come cheap,
you know.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.142
Victor? What are you doing?

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.682
I need it, my sweet.
Emergency.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:29.229
Victor, no! Please!
Come, now, Campanula, let go.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:31.026
But it's
my Golden Carrot Award.

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:33.069
This is hardly the time,
my darling.

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:35.318
Give it to me this instant!
But Victor!

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.110
Cheese, Gromit.

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:47.542
The Golden Carrot
belongs in the show!

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:50.496
No, the Golden Carrot
belongs in the Were-Rabbit.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:52.172
Huh?

01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:54.754
Every man for himself!

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:57.211
Help! Help! Help me!

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:03.096
Put me down at once, you
great, big, hairy thing, you!

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:04.676
Stop! Stop!

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:09.185
Mob supplies!
Get your angry mob supplies here.

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:23.654
Put her down,
you great ugly brute!

01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:30.703
I'll bagsy the lucky
rabbit's foot.

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:37.088
Help me, someone! Help me!

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:41.922
Yes.

01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:52.477
Huh?

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:57.571
No. No, no, no!

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:03.614
Huh?

01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:06.113
Huh?

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:12.961
Hmm?

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:14.246
Grr.

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:19.126
Put me down!
Put me down, you...

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.301
Whatever you are! Help!

01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:26.131
What is it?

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:30.062
What are you staring at
with those beastly eyes?

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:31.930
Huh?

01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:39.734
Wallace.

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:06.134
Oh, Wallace.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:08.591
What ever
have you done to yourself?

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:13.100
Well, don't you worry.
I'll protect you.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:19.274
Get your hairy mitts off
my future wife, you big brute.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:22.693
No! Victor!

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:25.151
You don't understand.
The hunt is off.

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:27.154
It's... We made
a terrible mistake.

01:09:27.622 --> 01:09:30.080
Oh, no. You commissioned me
to rid you of Pesto,

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.907
and that's just
what I intend to do.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:33.287
Oh!
Huh?

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.455
"Pesto"?

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:42.755
Why, you knew
it was Wallace all along.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:45.170
Oh, all right.

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:47.388
So what if it is that
blithering idiot.

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:49.182
No one will ever believe you.

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:57.183
And if I can't have your money,
I can still bag your bunny.

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:04.940
My eyes!

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:07.575
Run, rabbit, run!

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:15.250
Hmm.

01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:17.247
I rather like your hair
pinned back.

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:19.579
No, Victor, no! Stop! Please!

01:10:19.674 --> 01:10:21.210
Ha!
Victor!

01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:25.169
You can hop,
but you can't hide, Pesto.

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:41.397
Beware the moon!

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.167
Stupid interfering mutt.

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:03.331
Ha!

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:08.378
Huh?

01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:36.539
Stand back! There may be
a large rabbit dropping!

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:57.268
Looks like
the buck stops here.

01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:06.607
Huh? Oh.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:27.666
Ah.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:59.288
Eat karat, bunny boy!

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:29.356
Potty poo!

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:40.071
Huh?

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:04.558
No one beats
Victor Quartermaine!

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:06.059
Is that so?

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:07.640
Huh?

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:10.314
Consider yourself
dumped.

01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:18.530
He's in there!

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:24.912
There he is!
Surround him!

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:27.293
There he is! Over there!

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:31.797
Phillip,
help me! Phillip!

01:14:32.593 --> 01:14:33.924
Do something.

01:14:36.055 --> 01:14:41.266
Destroy! Drive out
the monstrosity!

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:50.274
Well, let's see
how he likes it.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:53.523
Wallace?

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.772
Oh, Gromit.

01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:37.939
Well, at least now
he's at peace.

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:39.236
The rabbit's gone.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:43.407
If only there were a way
to bring back Wallace.

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:55.169
Hee, hee, hee!

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:59.047
Lovely cheese, Gromit.

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:04.177
Gromit?

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:07.184
Oh, don't forget
the crackers.

01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:15.484
Cheese?

01:16:18.449 --> 01:16:19.564
Ah!

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:22.613
Cheese!

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:25.320
It's me again. I'm back!

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:28.990
Gromit!
You clever mutt.

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:31.372
Well done, old pal!

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:40.127
Totty!
Wallace! You're... Oh!

01:16:40.971 --> 01:16:42.712
Oh! Oops.

01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:45.261
Thanks, lad. Uh-oh.

01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:48.100
Uh... Oh, look!

01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:54.315
Well, I think
you deserve this, Gromit.

01:16:54.401 --> 01:16:58.235
For a brave
and splendid marrow.

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.610
We've all got
a lot to thank you for.

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:04.112
Ah.

01:17:04.411 --> 01:17:06.948
Every dog
has his day. Hmm?

01:17:07.039 --> 01:17:08.780
And thank you, Wallace.

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:12.701
You've saved me
from a terrible marriage.

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:14.869
All the same,

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:18.798
it is going to be rather
lonely at Tottington Hall now.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:22.843
Unless...

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.556
I have a little proposal
for you, Wallace.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:36.016
I'm so thrilled you agreed
to go through with this.

01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:38.818
Oh, my pleasure, Totty.

01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:42.105
One for the album, Gromit.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:46.196
Huh? Oh.

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:52.749
I declare this bunny
sanctuary officially open.

01:17:57.256 --> 01:17:58.667
When you're ready, lad.

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:01.840
Fire up the old BV6000.

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:14.182
Oh, it's simply marvelous.

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:18.767
My home, a safe haven
for all things fluffy.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.697
I do hope you'll still
come visit, Wallace.

01:18:28.787 --> 01:18:31.825
I'd rather got used to
having you around.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:34.908
Oh! There'll always
be a part of me

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:37.960
here at Tottington Hall.
Oh.

01:18:39.173 --> 01:18:40.959
Give it some more welly, lad.

01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:53.142
Cheese!

01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:40.489
Ahhh!
