to ride those pigs?

01:28.840 --> 01:31.360
Yeah, vote for Eric Brooks!

01:33.920 --> 01:35.160
Hey, Ray, is it me

01:35.160 --> 01:37.880
or did I almost get
run over by a pig?

01:37.880 --> 01:38.960
It's Eric Brooks

01:38.960 --> 01:41.120
giving away
free pig rides again.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.720
To sucker people into voting
for him for class president.

01:44.720 --> 01:45.680
Again?

01:45.680 --> 01:46.800
They should make him

01:46.800 --> 01:48.840
president for life--
he never loses.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.400
Eric:
A vote for Eric Brooks

01:50.400 --> 01:51.360
is a vote for fun!

01:51.360 --> 01:52.960
Who's next?

01:52.960 --> 01:55.040
I can't believe
everyone falls

01:55.040 --> 01:56.720
for the same stunts
every year.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.840
Nobody even tries
to run against him.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.520
Why don't you
run against him?

02:00.520 --> 02:02.200
Oh, great idea, Ray.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.240
I get up before
the whole school

02:04.240 --> 02:05.400
and start to glow.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.800
No, we need someone
smart and popular.

02:07.800 --> 02:08.960
Yeah.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.320
Someone with a great
personality and smile.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.560
I'm not running

Shh!

02:31.000 --> 02:32.960

02:32.960 --> 02:35.200
Oh! All right, well, listen

02:35.200 --> 02:38.720
if something comes up would you
give me a call, please?

02:38.720 --> 02:40.280
Thanks, bye.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.920
Paradise valley's art committee
has canceled their benefit.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.920
The company has
no project for me

02:45.920 --> 02:47.080
to work on now.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.560
Good! This will give you
a chance to relax.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.560
You deserve it.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.640
Yeah, it'll be nice

02:51.640 --> 02:52.800
to have you home.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.640
Well, the garage
does need cleaning

02:54.640 --> 02:56.560
and the bedroom
could use paint.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.840
No, no major projects.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.760
No cleaning,
no painting.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.800
I just want you
to take it easy.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.520
I suppose I could
always just catch up

03:04.520 --> 03:05.920
on some...

03:05.920 --> 03:07.040
Reading.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.840
what make our school great.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.440
Not "takes for granite."

03:15.440 --> 03:16.640
<i>Takes for granted.</i>

03:16.640 --> 03:18.960
<i>Oh, right, granted.</i>

03:18.960 --> 03:22.360
We cannot expect others
to help make our school better.

03:22.360 --> 03:23.640
We must do it ourselves.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.680
Excellent.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.560
I have what it take
to be a leader.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.440
I will be a good president
for all the students.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.880
I am Paulina Rubka.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.080
Slam dunk!

03:32.080 --> 03:33.360
<i>( Clapping )</i>

03:33.360 --> 03:36.440
You wanted someone to run
against Eric Brooks?

03:36.440 --> 03:37.840
There you go.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.720
Good work, just keep
practicing right here.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.360
We're going to run
an aggressive campaign.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.120
She's got
incredible spirit.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.960
<i>Why aren't you running?</i>

03:46.960 --> 03:48.960
Oh, no way.
I'm too controversial.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.320
I ruffle feathers
and tell it like it is.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.960
The voting public
hates that.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.840
Yeah, but do
you really think

03:54.840 --> 03:56.480
Paulina has a chance?

03:56.480 --> 03:59.280
Paulina has what it takes
to be a great class president.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.600
I mean,
she works hard

04:00.600 --> 04:01.560
loves democracy

04:01.560 --> 04:03.080
and she knows
what's best

04:03.080 --> 04:04.200
for the school...

04:04.200 --> 04:05.760
But to win?
I don't know.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.920
But she won't pander to
the lowest common denominator

04:08.920 --> 04:09.920
like Eric does.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.880
We're going to
canvass hallways--

04:11.880 --> 04:12.840
wish us luck.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.160
Good luck.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.519
Ray, I can't believe
you're just going

04:16.519 --> 04:18.560
to sit here
and let this happen.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.399
Paulina has no chance.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.160
Me? There are 111 other kids

04:22.160 --> 04:24.080
that could run against Eric.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.840
Why don't you
run against him?

04:25.840 --> 04:26.800
Me? Nah.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.240
I'm still new
in town

04:28.240 --> 04:30.640
and most kids
still don't like me.

04:30.640 --> 04:31.720
Maybe next year.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.360
Ray, you're the one.

04:33.360 --> 04:37.080
Who complained about the cold
potatoes in the cafeteria?

04:37.080 --> 04:38.360
Well, I did.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.840
And who's
always protesting

04:39.840 --> 04:42.840
'cause the outdoor basketball
courts don't have nets?

04:42.840 --> 04:43.800
Well, Ray does.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.480
And who did
Miss Clark say

04:45.480 --> 04:46.760
was funniest in class?

04:46.760 --> 04:48.880
I am-- I mean, me, but I think

04:48.880 --> 04:51.280
<i>it was the biggest clown
in class.</i>

04:51.280 --> 04:51.920
Yeah.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.040
And who has

04:53.040 --> 04:55.240
the nicest smile
in the eighth grade?

04:56.680 --> 04:59.480
You do present
a convincing case.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.760
There comes a time
in a person's life

05:01.760 --> 05:05.000
when he has to stand up
for what's right-- and, Ray

05:05.000 --> 05:06.400
that time is now.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.440
Everybody, everybody!

05:11.640 --> 05:14.320
I'm proud to announce
I'm running for president

05:14.320 --> 05:17.680
of the eighth grade class
at Danielle Atron Junior High.

Raymond! Raymond! Raymond...

05:49.760 --> 05:51.280
<i>Ray:
Make it a Ray day.</i>

05:51.280 --> 05:53.480
Vote for Ray Alvarado.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.240
Make it a Ray day.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.520
Here you go. Got one?
Take two.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.800
Raymond Alvarado.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.080
What's up,
Eric?

06:00.080 --> 06:01.200
What are you doing?

06:01.200 --> 06:02.160
He's running

06:02.160 --> 06:03.160
for president.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.160
What's it look like? Flyer?

06:05.160 --> 06:07.120
<i>Well, can't you talk, Ray?</i>

06:07.120 --> 06:09.160
I think you're in
over your head.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.840
You know,
a president has to be able

06:11.840 --> 06:14.080
<i>to stand on his own two feet.</i>

06:14.080 --> 06:17.120
Well, I'm not the one
giving people pig rides, Eric.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.320
<i>( Laughing )</i>

06:18.320 --> 06:20.560
And I can talk just fine.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.280
You'll have
your chance, Ray.

06:23.280 --> 06:27.040
You'll have your chance Friday,
when we give our speeches.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.640
We're all anxious to hear

06:28.640 --> 06:30.080
what Ray Alvarado has to say,
aren't we?

06:31.240 --> 06:33.560
Alex:
Don't worry about him, Ray.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.640
Face it, Ray--

06:34.640 --> 06:37.400
I'm going to take you down.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.080
We'll see about that.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.840
I can't believe you're
running against us.

06:42.840 --> 06:43.760
How could you?

06:43.760 --> 06:44.800
Couldn't you have

06:44.800 --> 06:45.880
come to me first?

06:45.880 --> 06:48.040
We could've all gotten
behind Paulina.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.280
No offense,
but Paulina has no chance.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.680
I know she's smart
and has great ideas...

06:52.680 --> 06:53.920
But you think

06:53.920 --> 06:56.960
this election is about pig rides
and personality!

06:56.960 --> 06:57.960
And you?

06:57.960 --> 07:00.040
I don't even want
to talk to you!

07:02.160 --> 07:03.920
<i>( Quietly ):
What?</i>

07:21.640 --> 07:25.440
<i>( Mascot's antennas boinging )</i>

07:27.680 --> 07:29.320
Okay, Ray.
Why do you think

07:29.320 --> 07:31.720
you're fit to be
our school president?

07:31.720 --> 07:33.760
Tell us about
your track record.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.800
Last year I anchored
the 440 relay

07:35.800 --> 07:37.680
and set a seventh
grade record

07:37.680 --> 07:38.920
in the 60-yard dash.

07:38.920 --> 07:39.880
Cut... cut!

07:39.880 --> 07:42.120
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

07:42.120 --> 07:43.560
Ray, we discussed this.

07:43.560 --> 07:44.840
Issues, Ray, issues.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.320
What about more school dances,
shorter school days?

07:48.320 --> 07:50.520
Oh, yeah, right.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.160
Hey, look
what I've got.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.880
Louis, we're way
behind here.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.640
Read this-- Eric's
playing serious hardball.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.280
"Poll shows that half
of the student body

07:59.280 --> 08:01.160
can't identify
Paulina rubka"?

08:01.160 --> 08:02.280
No, no, not that.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.600
Here. Look at that.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.120
"Presidential hopeful

<i>cried at the lion king."</i>

08:07.720 --> 08:08.680
I did not!

08:08.680 --> 08:09.760
Yes, you did.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.680
But why are they
writing about it?

08:11.680 --> 08:14.120
Eric's buddy, tino,
is on the newspaper.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.720
Keep reading--
it even says

08:15.720 --> 08:17.840
Raymond's middle name
is "Filbert."

08:17.840 --> 08:19.360
Filbert
is a family name.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.560
Let me see that!

08:22.160 --> 08:24.840
Hey, where did he get
this information from?

08:24.840 --> 08:26.280
This stuff's personal.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.320
Ballet lessons?!

08:27.320 --> 08:28.800
I never took ballet lessons.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.240
It was a movement class!

08:30.240 --> 08:31.360
Filbert. Wow.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.080
You're going to have
to prepare yourself

08:34.080 --> 08:35.120
for dirty tricks.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.039
We knew Eric
wouldn't play fair.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.159
What should we do?

08:38.159 --> 08:39.799
<i>We don't have
to do anything.</i>

08:39.799 --> 08:41.159
We'll win
this election

08:41.159 --> 08:43.039
fair and square,
on the issues.

08:43.039 --> 08:44.640
Besides, kids
don't believe

08:44.640 --> 08:47.000
what they read in
the school newspaper.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.400
She's right, Filbert,
nobody does.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.680
It's really funny

08:50.680 --> 08:51.880
but nobody believes it.

08:51.880 --> 08:52.880
Besides, who cares

08:52.880 --> 08:54.560
<i>if you cried
at the lion king?</i>

08:54.560 --> 08:55.920
It shows
you're sensitive

08:55.920 --> 08:56.920
and that's good!

08:56.920 --> 08:58.800
Now let's finish
your commercial.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.640
Action!

09:11.600 --> 09:13.200
Okay, Ray,
why do you think

you're fit to be

09:15.560 --> 09:17.640
Tell us about

09:26.840 --> 09:28.160
so I whipped this up.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.400
I hope you like it!

09:29.400 --> 09:30.720
Doesn't
exactly sound

09:30.720 --> 09:32.760
like Mom took it
too easy today.

09:32.760 --> 09:33.440
Ta-da!

09:35.080 --> 09:36.040
Wow!

09:38.040 --> 09:39.480
<i>( Catching breath )</i>

09:39.480 --> 09:41.520
You just whipped that up?

09:41.520 --> 09:43.680
And I made two sauces.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.160
One's thai curry

09:45.160 --> 09:46.000
one's apricot.

09:46.000 --> 09:46.800
But I thought

09:46.800 --> 09:48.600
you were going to read

09:48.600 --> 09:50.200
<i> no congas,
no clarinets?</i>

09:50.200 --> 09:52.160
What can I say, honey?

09:52.160 --> 09:54.600
There's just so much
to do around here!

09:54.600 --> 09:55.760
<i>( Laughs )</i>

10:00.880 --> 10:03.440
<i>Alex: Ray Alvarado
is a man of the people.</i>

10:03.440 --> 10:05.480
<i> Vote for Ray Alvarado
this Friday</i>

10:05.480 --> 10:08.880
<i> and shake hands with the future
of Atron Junior High.</i>

10:10.160 --> 10:13.720
<i>( Applause )</i>

10:13.720 --> 10:15.680
Well done, Ray, well done.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.880
Our next political commercial
belongs to Paulina.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.560
<i>( Patriotic music playing )</i>

10:24.560 --> 10:27.600
<i>Nicole: Throughout history,
change has never been easy.</i>

10:27.600 --> 10:29.800
<i> It takes courage,
strength and vision.</i>

10:29.800 --> 10:32.560
<i> Paulina Rubka has all those
qualities and more.</i>

10:32.560 --> 10:33.840
I am Paulina Rubka.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.520
I know what it will take
to make our school better.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.440
I will fight for you
to bring you the things you want

10:39.440 --> 10:41.120
to Danielle Atron Junior High.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.120
Won't you join me?

10:42.120 --> 10:43.920
Vote for me for class president.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.280
Slam dunk!

10:47.080 --> 10:49.640
<i>Very nice, Paulina
( Applause )</i>

10:49.640 --> 10:51.280
Very nice.

10:51.280 --> 10:54.960
Okay, and our last spot
belongs to Eric.

10:58.400 --> 11:02.160
<i>Man: Ray Alvarado claims to be
one of the best basketball players</i>

11:02.160 --> 11:03.560
<i> in the eighth grade.</i>

11:03.560 --> 11:07.600
<i>Fact: Ray spent most of his time
on the bench.</i>

11:09.560 --> 11:15.240
<i> Ray Alvarado claimed a 98%
on-time paper delivery record.</i>

11:15.240 --> 11:18.720
<i> Fact: An internal company
survey showed him</i>

11:18.720 --> 11:21.720
<i>with a 40% in-the-gutter factor.</i>

11:22.760 --> 11:25.160
<i> Ray Alvarado told people</i>

11:25.160 --> 11:28.360
<i> he was destined to be
a professional musician.</i>

11:28.360 --> 11:32.040
<i> Fact: Ray quit the saxophone
after four lessons.</i>

11:32.040 --> 11:33.840
<i>( Playing poorly )</i>

11:33.840 --> 11:35.480
<i> Ask yourself.</i>

11:35.480 --> 11:38.960
<i> Do you want Ray Alvarado
as your next school president?</i>

11:51.720 --> 11:53.320
Okay, don't forget

11:53.320 --> 11:56.080
candidates' speeches,
ready noon tomorrow.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.800
Sorry, Ray,
that was brutal.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.800
Hey, Eric.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.320
How come you couldn't
slam Paulina, too?

12:04.320 --> 12:05.280
Paulina who?

12:05.280 --> 12:07.080
How do you like
politics, Ray?

12:07.080 --> 12:08.120
I was on the bench

12:08.120 --> 12:09.800
because I pulled
my hamstring!

12:09.800 --> 12:10.800
I never said

12:10.800 --> 12:12.440
I'd be a professional
musician.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.360
We're just stating
the facts.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.440
You didn't have
to stoop so low.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.000
Listen to you crybabies.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.080
This is politics.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.240
If you can't take it

12:20.240 --> 12:21.840
find another line of work.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.840
If you think that was tough,
wait till my speech.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.040
I want him, Alex

12:27.040 --> 12:29.120
and I don't care
what it takes.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.120
Easy, Ray.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.960
What is it?

12:49.600 --> 12:51.520
Ray:
Can we say we found it open?

12:51.520 --> 12:52.880
Would that be wrong?

12:52.880 --> 12:56.120
Alex: Well, it would be
wrong for you to look at it.

12:58.600 --> 13:02.280
But I think it would be
all right if I looked it over.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.680
I mean,
because we can't trust Eric.

13:04.680 --> 13:07.440
Tell me if he plans
to let out more secrets.

13:07.440 --> 13:10.080
I want my third grade
report card kept quiet.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.200
What's it say?

13:11.200 --> 13:12.560
Very interesting.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.080
He wants each student
to be able to veto

13:15.080 --> 13:17.080
one teacher per semester.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.600
Vote a teacher?

13:18.600 --> 13:19.840
What does that mean?

13:19.840 --> 13:23.160
It means if you get, like,
Krantz for chemistry

13:23.160 --> 13:26.320
you vote him and the school
gives you another teacher.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.360
Wow.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.920
What a great idea!

13:28.920 --> 13:29.840
No, it's not.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.600
It is, but it'll never happen.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.200
But it makes him sound good
by offering it.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.480
Let me see that.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.840
He also wants to allow students

13:38.840 --> 13:41.200
to call teachers
by their first names.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.360
What do you think?

13:42.360 --> 13:43.480
I kind of like it.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.760
Ray, think about it.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.800
He's promising things
that'll never happen.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.800
That's how real politicians
get elected.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.400
Maybe we should, too.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.520
You're right.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.400
It's the only way
to beat him.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.520
Ours can't compete
with that stuff.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.520
He's just offering
easy answers.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.040
You'll offer
easier ones.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.320
This is great, Alex.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.720
I want to
make him pay.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.240
If it wasn't Eric Brooks

14:05.240 --> 14:07.440
I never would've opened
his speech.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.720
But we had to
for the school's good.

14:11.480 --> 14:14.120
<i>( Laughter )</i>

14:14.120 --> 14:16.720
<i>( Computer beeps )</i>

14:16.720 --> 14:17.440
Aw.

14:18.960 --> 14:19.880
<i>( Bang )</i>

14:19.880 --> 14:21.360
Oh, I'm okay!

14:21.360 --> 14:23.200
I just dropped the mallet.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.160
The mallet?

14:24.160 --> 14:26.320
What's she doing with a mallet?

14:26.320 --> 14:29.600
She's cracking coconuts
for tomorrow's breakfast.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.800
Something she calls
"breakfasts of the world."

14:32.800 --> 14:34.960
Oh, Dad, can't we stop her?

14:34.960 --> 14:36.880
I've been through this before.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.400
We just have to let it
run its course.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.720
Mrs. Mack: You guys are
going to love breakfast.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.360
Can I sit here with you?

14:44.360 --> 14:45.360
Sure.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.680
<i>( Sighs )</i>

14:53.560 --> 14:55.680
You know,
I don't miss work a bit.

14:55.680 --> 14:56.720
<i>( Chuckles )</i>

15:00.560 --> 15:03.440
Ray: I have a dream for
all junior high students

15:03.440 --> 15:05.640
regardless of grade, height,
or G.P.A.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.560
To enjoy a gourmet cafeteria
and all it offers.

15:08.560 --> 15:12.200
I'm talking about a wide variety
of pizzas available daily

15:12.200 --> 15:14.840
and a ban on that roast beef
stringy stuff

15:14.840 --> 15:16.280
they serve on Tuesdays.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.240
<i>( Clapping )</i>

15:17.240 --> 15:18.520
This is great, Ray.

15:18.520 --> 15:21.200
When Eric hears it,
he'll have no place to hide.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.840
But is calling the principal
by his first name pushing it?

15:24.840 --> 15:27.280
Mort's a funny name--
it's worth votes.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.200
Aloha, Ray.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.200
I know it's a big day
for you

15:30.200 --> 15:32.040
but would you like
to join us

15:32.040 --> 15:34.360
for a polynesian breakfast?

15:34.360 --> 15:35.320
Why not?

15:35.320 --> 15:36.440
This way.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.800
Aloha, Ray.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.640
Welcome to the Islands.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.840
Mrs. Mack:
Okay, sit.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.680
Mom, can I just have oatmeal?

15:46.680 --> 15:51.480
Alex, I'm trying to expand
your horizons beyond oatmeal.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.160
This is part of your mother's

15:53.160 --> 15:55.200
"breakfasts of the world"
series.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.640
Mrs. Mack:
Okey-dokey.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.880
Who wants to try
some poi?

16:03.240 --> 16:04.200
Oh!

16:05.880 --> 16:08.720
Paulina: Coming from eastern
Europe, I know what it means

16:08.720 --> 16:10.760
to fight
for what you believe in.

16:10.760 --> 16:15.120
We need a dialogue between
students, teachers, and parents.

16:15.120 --> 16:18.600
Only when we communicate
is real change possible.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.560
My name is Paulina.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.960
Slam dunk!

16:21.960 --> 16:23.320
<i>( Applause )</i>

16:26.280 --> 16:28.480
Wow,
she's really good.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.400
I asked her to drop "slam dunk"
but she really believes in it.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.960
Nicole, I feel terrible.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.120
I don't have a real campaign

16:37.120 --> 16:38.560
and stand for nothing.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.040
We wanted to beat Eric.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.400
I didn't think Paulina
could win.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.680
Sorry, Nicole.

16:43.680 --> 16:44.840
It's okay, guys.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.920
As long as someone beats Eric,
I'll be happy.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.080
Oh, you were great!

16:49.080 --> 16:50.040
Thank you!

16:50.040 --> 16:51.000
Good job.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.320
Thanks.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.920
Good luck to you,
Raymond.

16:53.920 --> 16:54.880
Slam dunk.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.040
Thanks, Paulina.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.440
Slam dunk to you,
too.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.680
Excuse me
while I go to the lavatory.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.240
Better come back.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.240
How's she doing?

17:03.240 --> 17:04.520
Oh, she's doing fine.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.520
But I'm losing my faith
in the political process.

17:07.520 --> 17:10.079
Let's work
on your acceptance speech.

17:10.079 --> 17:11.040
Great speech!

17:11.040 --> 17:12.000
Thanks, bye.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.640
Good luck!

17:13.640 --> 17:14.680
<i>( Clears throat )</i>

17:17.400 --> 17:20.400
Did you guys find my fake speech
all right?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.480
What are you talking about?

17:22.480 --> 17:25.319
You don't think
I'd base my whole platform

17:25.319 --> 17:28.520
on vetoing teachers and calling
them by their first names?

17:28.520 --> 17:31.400
Ray's going to look
like such an idiot.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.520
You probably spent hours
preparing a speech to burn me.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.600
That's why I dropped it
near you.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.080
Woman: Our next
candidate is Eric Brooks.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.040

17:40.040 --> 17:41.000

17:42.960 --> 17:44.400
Annie:
Dad...

17:44.400 --> 17:45.720
Can we talk?

17:45.720 --> 17:47.840
Sure, honey,
what's on your mind?

17:49.360 --> 17:50.720
I love Mom.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.360
I know you do.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.160
But she is
driving me crazy.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.120
Me, too.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.200
She means well.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.440
It's just that she's
very disciplined

17:58.440 --> 18:01.080
and used to putting
energy into her work.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.720
Well, whatever,
but could you talk to her?

18:03.720 --> 18:04.720
I guess so.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.560
Do you want me to go
with you?

18:06.560 --> 18:07.600
Sure.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.640
Okay.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.000
Well, uh, you're
not doing anything.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.560
I'm reading.

18:18.560 --> 18:19.760
But you're not...

18:19.760 --> 18:22.400
Cooking and cleaning? No.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.640
First, there's nothing
left to clean

18:24.640 --> 18:27.280
and, second,
I was driving you guys nuts.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.920
How did you know?

18:28.920 --> 18:30.960
You all went screaming

18:30.960 --> 18:33.600
from the room every time
I entered.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.760
It wasn't as bad
as all that.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.280
Yes, it was.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.400
But that's okay.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.960
Donna called me...
The art benefit is on.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.600
I'm back at work tomorrow.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.880
I guess there's no more
"breakfasts of the world"?

18:45.880 --> 18:47.680
No, just plain old Mom again.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.480
Fine. That's okay.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.880
By the way

18:51.880 --> 18:53.600
we could all learn
to relax more

18:53.600 --> 18:54.680
Don't you think?

18:54.680 --> 18:56.040
You're right, honey.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.360
We could all take a page
from Alex's book.

18:58.360 --> 19:01.040
Now, she knows
how to relax.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.560
Is he in there?

19:06.560 --> 19:07.680
No.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.800
You go that way.

19:08.800 --> 19:09.920
If you see him

19:09.920 --> 19:11.960
Don't let him
on that stage

19:11.960 --> 19:13.960
until he talks to me first.

19:13.960 --> 19:17.000
Eric: I'd like to
congratulate Paulina and Ray

19:17.000 --> 19:18.400
for their campaigns.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.480
At another school

19:19.480 --> 19:21.200
they may have been
mistaken

19:21.200 --> 19:23.680
for serious candidates.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.120
But at Danielle Atron
Junior High School

19:26.120 --> 19:28.000
it's obvious they aren't.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.120
<i>( Laughter )</i>

19:29.120 --> 19:30.440
Where's my campaign manager?

19:30.440 --> 19:31.720
I don't know, Ray.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.720
Just relax and be yourself.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.320
No, being myself
doesn't always work for me.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.440
Ray, good luck.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.920
One of us must stop Eric.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.920
...and should I win,
you can expect my victory party

19:41.920 --> 19:43.960
to top anything
we've done before.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.400
Thanks for your support!

19:45.400 --> 19:46.760
<i>( Applause )</i>

19:46.760 --> 19:48.120
We're going to
wait inside.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.560
Calm down, she'll be here.

19:52.600 --> 19:55.120
<i>( Applause )</i>

19:55.120 --> 19:58.520
And now, for our third
and final candidate...

19:58.520 --> 20:00.320
Raymond Alvarado.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.520
<i>( Applause )</i>

20:08.240 --> 20:09.880
Thank you, thank you.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.080
Thanks, Carol.

20:11.080 --> 20:14.880
Boys and girls, Phyllis,
Carol and Mort.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.920
<i>( Tittering )</i>

20:15.920 --> 20:17.360
I'd like
to talk to you

20:17.360 --> 20:20.600
about how the teachers
have an unfair advantage

20:20.600 --> 20:23.280
over the students
at Atron Junior High.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.760
I think it's time
for the students

20:25.760 --> 20:27.080
to give them

20:27.080 --> 20:29.040
a report card every semester.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.160
<i>( Applause )</i>

20:30.160 --> 20:31.240
Oh, no.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.920
Ray Alvarado.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.200
Ray!

20:39.200 --> 20:40.120
Raymond!

20:40.120 --> 20:41.520
<i>( Applause )</i>

20:44.240 --> 20:46.160
<i>( Continuing speech )</i>

20:50.040 --> 20:51.880
<i>( Applause )</i>

20:53.160 --> 20:54.640
Ray, Ray...

20:54.640 --> 20:56.080
Kill the speech.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.440
Eric set us up.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.520
He did?

20:58.520 --> 21:00.480
Kill the speech.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.440
Kill the speech!

21:07.240 --> 21:10.360
But you know no one will ever
give us that stuff.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.080
So don't get excited.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.120
I just said it
as a joke.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.040
But that just comes to show you

21:16.040 --> 21:18.480
how we have all been fooled
in the past.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.280
In fact, let's face it.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.560
Paulina's the only candidate
who really wants to help us.

21:23.560 --> 21:25.600
Eric gives you
pig rides and parties.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.880
I would like

21:26.880 --> 21:28.440
to throw my support to her.

21:28.440 --> 21:29.560
Paulina...

21:29.560 --> 21:31.640
come up to the stage.

21:31.640 --> 21:35.160
<i>( Cheering and applause )</i>

21:44.680 --> 21:47.800
<i>( Cheering )</i>

21:47.800 --> 21:50.320
Slam Dunk.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.320
Slam Dunk!

21:53.320 --> 21:54.720
<i>( Cheering )</i>

21:59.000 --> 22:00.520
It didn't work, did it?

22:00.520 --> 22:02.440
Eric's still the president.

22:02.440 --> 22:05.600
Maybe, but it takes time to
change the system.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.760
At least Paulina made it close.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.200
How's she taking it?

22:09.200 --> 22:10.480
Are you kidding?

22:10.480 --> 22:13.920
She's already planning
for next year's campaign.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.040
And you?

22:15.040 --> 22:17.040
Me? I'm retired
from politics.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.080
Getting one vote

22:18.080 --> 22:20.400
didn't exactly
boost my confidence.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.200
Good thing
I paid Louis back

22:22.200 --> 22:23.640
that five I owed him.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.400
I would have been
shut out.

22:25.400 --> 22:28.000
So, you want to go
to Eric's party?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.760
Yeah, I never ridden
a camel before.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.040
Me neither.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.160
Let's go.
