00:33.640 --> 00:35.800
England.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.080
I will find him.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.480
Robin, stop! Robin! Stop!

00:55.720 --> 00:58.280
Robin!

00:58.280 --> 01:00.440
Do not do this! Give me that staff.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.000
What?

01:02.000 --> 01:06.280
Eh? Eh? Robin!

01:06.280 --> 01:10.360
I said stop holding me back!

01:10.360 --> 01:12.000
You can't do this alone.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.840
And what're you gonna do, Allan, eh?

01:13.840 --> 01:17.320
Tell me, what're you gonna do?That's a bit harsh.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.480
Once a traitor, always a traitor.

01:19.480 --> 01:23.040
That's not fair.You shut up! You leech!

01:23.040 --> 01:25.160
You're pathetic!

01:25.160 --> 01:27.000
We're tired, Robin.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.320
We've been travelling for months.
And I've had time to think.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.640
And I've made up my mind.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.520
I don't need you any more.

01:35.520 --> 01:39.400
Any of you. You don't mean that.
This is not you!

01:39.400 --> 01:41.320
Much, it's over! None of this!

01:41.320 --> 01:44.040
Robin Hood is finished!Don't say that.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.600
He died in the Holy Land, all right?

01:48.120 --> 01:50.040
With Marian.

01:50.040 --> 01:52.880
Now all I have left is vengeance.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.880
Then let us come with you.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.040
Hey, hey!

01:58.040 --> 02:00.920
Stop holding me back, I mean it.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.000
Get back - now!

02:04.000 --> 02:05.200
Don't follow me.

02:05.200 --> 02:09.199
It's between me and Gisborne now.

02:09.199 --> 02:10.800
Gisborne dies today.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.200
GISBORNE!

03:56.200 --> 03:58.760
He is come.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.400
Ahhhh!

04:58.440 --> 04:59.840
LITTLE GIRL: Papa!

05:08.360 --> 05:10.280
Where is he?

05:10.280 --> 05:13.120
Where's everyone?

05:13.120 --> 05:14.720
There!

05:14.720 --> 05:16.440
Up there! Come on!

05:23.800 --> 05:25.640
Papa!

05:27.720 --> 05:30.080
Where're you gonna run to, Gisborne?

05:43.280 --> 05:46.760
One more step, she goes over.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.280
Please! Not my daughter!

05:49.280 --> 05:51.760
It's all right. Don't be scared.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.240
I'm not. You're Robin Hood.

05:54.240 --> 05:57.280
Gisborne, let her go.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.840
I'll drop the weapons. You first.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.880
Woah! All right!

06:19.360 --> 06:21.120
You must pay for what you did.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.840
No.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.760
I was you. You forced me to do it.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.640
You murdered her.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.240
She didn't love you.

06:28.240 --> 06:32.040
She should have been mine!
She was my wife! No!

06:42.760 --> 06:47.120
Prepare to die, Robin Hood. Argh!

07:02.880 --> 07:05.160
Aaagh!

07:08.520 --> 07:10.240
I'll kill you!

07:13.200 --> 07:15.120
Take him away!

07:18.160 --> 07:21.400
Hey! No. They've got him! No!

07:41.720 --> 07:43.760
My dear friend!

07:43.760 --> 07:45.960
To what do I owe this
exquisite pleasure?

07:47.640 --> 07:50.560
I'm here to give you
something from Prince John.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.280
Oh? Really?

07:53.280 --> 07:55.600
And what would that be?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.320
An ultimatum.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.280
Robin?

08:09.280 --> 08:11.480
John?

08:15.680 --> 08:17.960
John?

08:17.960 --> 08:19.720
Is it him?

08:19.720 --> 08:23.680
No. I reckon he's gone for good.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.800
And we weren't there to save him.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.000
We'd better go, John.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.360
Hey, we've got to think about
the living now, big man. Come on.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.480
This is from Prince John.

08:50.480 --> 08:54.000
You made a pig's breakfast of
your mission in the Holy Land.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.560
That wasn't my fault.

08:55.560 --> 08:58.960
The result of your blundering,
the Prince is hurting.

09:00.520 --> 09:07.000
And he's passing on that hurt
by creating an extra little tax,

09:07.000 --> 09:08.680
just for you.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.440
How much? 1,000 crowns.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.120
A month.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.520
That's impossible.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.960
Count yourself lucky. The King
wanted your head on a spike.

09:19.960 --> 09:24.440
Prince John protected you
and demands you repay his loyalty.

09:24.440 --> 09:28.160
Otherwise, he'll
be obliged to, er...

09:28.160 --> 09:30.480
Yes? ..let you go.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.680
He shall have his money.

09:34.680 --> 09:38.360
And once and for all deal with Hood.

09:38.360 --> 09:41.080
He's become a significant
pain in the princely backside.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.760
You don't need to worry
about him any more. Ah!

09:43.760 --> 09:47.440
Ah, Gisborne! What do you mean?

09:47.440 --> 09:51.640
He's dead. I killed him.

09:51.640 --> 09:55.960
Robin Hood is dead. By these hands.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.480
Look!

10:02.040 --> 10:04.960
Oh, Gisborne!

10:04.960 --> 10:07.520
Oh, this is a great day!

10:09.480 --> 10:11.640
The outlaw is no more!

10:11.640 --> 10:14.960
Let the bells sound
all over the land!

10:14.960 --> 10:19.880
Rejoice, rejoice!Er, sorry to nit-pick but

10:19.880 --> 10:24.360
Shouldn't we hold the celebrations
till we have proof? Proof?

10:24.360 --> 10:26.960
Proof? Like, where's the body?

11:35.680 --> 11:37.680
Come on!

11:41.520 --> 11:43.720
Come on!

11:43.720 --> 11:48.720
I didn't come all this way
for you to die on me before
we've even started.

11:48.720 --> 11:52.840
GISBORNE: Wherever he is, I want
you to find his body! No-one leaves

11:52.840 --> 11:55.520
 till you find the body! Move!

11:58.240 --> 12:00.560
Where are ya?

12:03.920 --> 12:06.200
Lost something, my friend?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.760
What did you say?

12:07.760 --> 12:10.040
Sir Guy, isn't it?

12:11.200 --> 12:14.880
Who are you? What are you doing here?

12:14.880 --> 12:18.080
Man of God, travelling north.
Finding shelter where I can.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.480
I congratulate you on your victory.

12:24.480 --> 12:28.880
You struck a great blow in the war
against lawlessness,
it must give you joy.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.680
Have you seen a body?
No, I've seen no corpse.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.280
The river's taken it maybe.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.920
Maybe.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.640
You seem troubled, my son.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.600
Can I offer you a simple supper?

12:41.600 --> 12:43.920
Or a confession?

12:45.440 --> 12:48.640
Soothe whatever disturbs your mind.No, I want to keep searching.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.560
I need to find him -
that'll soothe my mind.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.320
Robin, can you hear me?

13:08.320 --> 13:10.520
Who are you?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.080
Where am I?

13:18.360 --> 13:21.120
I said, who are you?

13:21.120 --> 13:22.720
Brother Tuck.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.880
Now, hold still.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.520
What are you doing? Wargh... Agh!

13:38.040 --> 13:41.440
Dislocated. Didn't want to touch
it till you were on the mend.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.480
Did I kill him?

13:46.600 --> 13:47.960
No.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.040
Well, then I have to finish...

13:50.040 --> 13:52.560
Woah, you're not going anywhere.
Be still.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.160
You best let me up!

13:55.160 --> 13:58.200
I said be still!

13:58.200 --> 14:00.840
Rest in peace, my son.

14:08.400 --> 14:13.080
Ah Gisborne, no sign of Hood's body,
I take it? You know, your future,

14:13.080 --> 14:16.800
your lives, are hanging by a thread.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.760
I'll be back from Lincoln
tomorrow to collect the Prince's
money and view the body.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.640
Make sure both are ready.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.160
So melodramatic.

14:32.160 --> 14:36.880
Oh, a thought on the spondulicks -
Hood was an outlaw,
all outlaws have a stash.

14:36.880 --> 14:41.400
And Robin Hood is now dead -
apparently.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.280
I want my cut, mind.

14:47.160 --> 14:50.880
I'm loath to say it, Gisborne.
But for once that preening ninny,

14:50.880 --> 14:53.520
he might be on to something.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.960
The smell of my broth
wake you, did it?

15:05.480 --> 15:07.680
You knocked me out.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.200
Yep.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.440
Here.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.040
Come on, drink this.

15:21.320 --> 15:25.720
You wanna starve? Fine, starve.
You best untie me. Nope.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.560
I don't appreciate being
trussed up here like a pig!

15:28.560 --> 15:32.800
It's for your own good. And mine.
Now drink this.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.560
Come on!

15:34.560 --> 15:36.080
Come on!

15:45.800 --> 15:47.640
Why are you doing this?

15:50.240 --> 15:53.200
You know, years ago,
when I left this country,

15:53.200 --> 15:57.160
the people of this nation were
proud, strong, full of spirit.

15:57.160 --> 16:02.600
Now I come back to find their backs
broken, their hope shattered.

16:02.600 --> 16:07.080
Everywhere I go I see fear and
suspicion haunting their faces.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.000
And yet everywhere

16:09.000 --> 16:11.640
I hear one name.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.960
Even from the mouths of children.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.000
One name, whispered in hope.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.680
One name that keeps the
flame of England burning.

16:21.040 --> 16:25.560
Robin Hood. Well, maybe
that name's all ready dead.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.160
Because I'm done with it.

16:45.440 --> 16:50.600
So, how, er, how brave are you
feeling today?

16:50.600 --> 16:53.880
Rot in hell. This brave?

16:56.720 --> 16:58.800
Or this brave?

16:58.800 --> 17:00.760
Why don't you try me?

17:00.760 --> 17:02.680
Where's the money?

17:02.680 --> 17:05.440
Hood must have had a stash hidden
somewhere.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.079
Everything he had,

17:08.599 --> 17:10.800
everything he stole from you,

17:12.800 --> 17:14.319
he gave away.

17:16.520 --> 17:20.520
You just don't get it, do you?

17:23.240 --> 17:26.480
AARGH!!!

17:30.080 --> 17:32.240
Tell me.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.680
All right...

17:37.680 --> 17:39.600
All I'm saying is,
it's just us now.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.920
And we've got to get
Much out of there.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.600
You're good, aren't you? What? Stating the obvious.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.240
Well, what have you got?

17:46.240 --> 17:48.880
Well, getting in's not the problem,
is it? It's getting out.

17:48.880 --> 17:52.040
Well, now who's stating the obvious?

17:52.040 --> 17:54.200
Planning's not our thing, is it?

17:54.200 --> 17:57.480
You know, you're muscle and
I'm more on the blagging side.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.760
Robin was always the man
with the plan.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.920
Sorry.

18:28.920 --> 18:33.880
They all look so alike - trees.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.520
String him up.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.840
No, wait, wait, wait, wait!

18:37.840 --> 18:39.520
Huh!

18:39.520 --> 18:41.400
It's here.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.160
Huh! Here!

18:43.160 --> 18:44.680
Ha!

18:48.440 --> 18:55.680
Start digging. Tricky.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.680
Oh, no, no, no.
You're not going anywhere...

19:27.240 --> 19:28.920
Robin!

19:28.920 --> 19:32.760
Search over there. Not here.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.480
Agh! Agh!

19:54.360 --> 19:57.000
Wait!

19:57.000 --> 19:59.080
He's just a boy!

19:59.080 --> 20:02.200
Tuck. Robin Hood is dead.
It has to stay that way.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.320
I can be free of this at last!

20:04.320 --> 20:06.200
Wait!

20:06.200 --> 20:08.960
Let me deal with it.
Let me deal with it.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.920
Let me deal with it.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.440
OK?

20:18.320 --> 20:21.320
Listen to me, lad.
You'll leave now and never return.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.640
You won't tell a soul what you've
seen here or I'll come to you one

20:24.640 --> 20:26.680
night and you'll die
a terrible death!

20:26.680 --> 20:31.000
I've seen nothing, I swear! Go! Go!

20:35.920 --> 20:38.000
I can't let you kill Robin Hood.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.040
Give me one hour to
change your mind.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.960
So?

20:45.960 --> 20:49.640
Well, I'm pretty sure...

20:49.640 --> 20:51.480
that...

20:51.480 --> 20:53.120
this wasn't the tree.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.400
But...

20:55.400 --> 20:57.240
I reckon it might be that one.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.000
Give me the shovel.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.480
Fill it in.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.320
What?

21:32.360 --> 21:34.240
After him!

21:34.240 --> 21:38.160
Get him! Quick, after him, come on!

22:05.640 --> 22:07.760
Idiots. Idiots!

22:15.240 --> 22:17.600
Guards!

22:17.600 --> 22:19.120
Guards!

22:22.760 --> 22:25.720
You're all right, you're all right.
Thanks, mate.

22:33.240 --> 22:39.360
Search them! Everything they have,
everything they own, I want it.

22:39.360 --> 22:43.480
Bring 'em round, line 'em up.
I want all of it!

22:43.480 --> 22:50.000
Gold, silver, round their necks,
round their wrists,
in their filthy mouths!

22:50.000 --> 22:51.960
I want the lot!

22:54.320 --> 22:56.160
Every day it gets worse.

22:56.160 --> 22:59.520
Injustice, cruelty, corruption.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.760
These people suffer and they starve.

23:05.880 --> 23:12.760
And you'll abandon them?
Robin, where are you going?

23:14.680 --> 23:16.320
I can't help them.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.280
I've got nothing else to give.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.840
You will believe in yourself
again, I know it.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.840
I struggled,

23:24.840 --> 23:27.560
I fought, I gave everything I had.

23:33.440 --> 23:36.280
I even gave the life
of the woman I love.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.000
Why are you doing this?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.920
Why does it matter so much to you?

23:42.920 --> 23:47.120
Because I have nothing in my life
except my God and my country.

23:47.120 --> 23:51.400
I've no family, no wife,
yet I have a full heart.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.480
And passion must
go somewhere, Robin.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.720
I'm just saying rest first.

24:02.720 --> 24:06.040
Then maybe speak
to that scruffy gang of yours.

24:09.880 --> 24:13.320
I said terrible things to those men.

24:13.320 --> 24:17.200
The bravest, most loyal men
in England.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.640
I didn't want...
any more blood on my hands.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.920
The truth is, I'd die for them.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.880
Give yourself a chance.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.160
No, Tuck. I'm finished for good.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.280
I walk a few yards
and I'm shattered.

24:33.480 --> 24:36.400
And you say I'm the last great hope
for England.

24:51.320 --> 24:54.240
Maybe there is a way.

25:12.640 --> 25:15.600
Forgive me, Robin.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.880
Sir Guy, look at me.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.840
Look at me.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.400
So tired.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.200
Every time I close my eyes they come.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.880
They?

25:49.880 --> 25:52.120
Demons.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.200
Clawing at my brain.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.680
How can I get some peace?

25:59.680 --> 26:02.520
To find peace there
must be a reckoning.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.640
A reckoning?

26:04.640 --> 26:07.560
There are outlaws
still on the loose.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.680
No.

26:09.680 --> 26:12.560
Without Hood they're lost.

26:12.560 --> 26:15.560
It's only a matter of time
before they're caught.

26:15.560 --> 26:19.320
What is it that haunts you, my son?

26:19.320 --> 26:20.840
The fear.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.520
The fear that my enemy isn't dead.

26:26.520 --> 26:30.120
That he's out there somewhere,
watching.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.360
Waiting.

26:33.360 --> 26:36.160
Well, then I can help you.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.160
Robin Hood is no more.

26:38.160 --> 26:42.120
He was buried last night in secret.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.440
Trust me.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.560
His friends will meet today
at Dead Man's Crossing.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.080
You can take them there.

26:55.040 --> 26:59.040
Thank you. Thank you.

27:06.080 --> 27:08.160
But if you lie,

27:08.160 --> 27:10.360
you die.

27:17.640 --> 27:20.720
A poor way to say farewell.

27:25.480 --> 27:29.120
To Robin.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.160
And to us.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.680
Goodbye, Robin.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.600
For ever.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.120
What the...?

27:46.120 --> 27:49.120
Who are you?! A tall dark stranger?

27:49.120 --> 27:50.960
Answer the question, big mouth.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.240
You're a big lad,

27:53.240 --> 27:55.720
but you're out of condition.What...?

27:55.720 --> 28:00.440
Ooh! Hey! Get off me!

28:00.440 --> 28:04.920
You want some of that? Er... Nah.
Got a...bad arm.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.520
Name's Tuck.
I've just come from Robin.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.440
He'd like to see you
if that's...convenient.

28:13.480 --> 28:16.720
What? Robin's alive? Yep, he's fine.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.240
Be right as rain. Just needs
a bit of a rest.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.840
Well, you'll see for yourself.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.360
He's alive?

28:22.360 --> 28:26.320
Alive?! He's alive!

28:26.320 --> 28:29.280
Hang on. I don't believe it.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.880
Well, he gave me this to, er,

28:31.880 --> 28:33.840
prove my credentials.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.760
Marian's ring.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.880
Thank you, brother.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.120
What's your game, eh?

28:49.120 --> 28:51.000
Same as yours.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.280
Why should I trust you?

28:53.280 --> 28:56.000
Look, I think he's sorry
for leaving you.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.840
He'll explain it all himself.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.920
Dead Man's Crossing. Midday.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.720
Something's not right.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.440
This whole thing's not right.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.000
He'll come.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.520
Robin's alive.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.640
I can feel it.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.840
He'll be here.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.720
Come to pay our respects.
Hope you don't mind.

29:42.720 --> 29:46.560
What did I tell you about that monk?Take them away.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.560
Betrayal!

29:48.560 --> 29:49.920
All right...

29:49.920 --> 29:51.680
Come on, get a move on! Move it!

29:51.680 --> 29:53.200
Come on.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.680
God forgive me.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.920
The people built this
to remember Robin Hood.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.600
I never knew they felt like this.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.280
You see the power you have?

30:25.280 --> 30:27.920
This is why God spared you.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.640
To give the people hope.

30:29.640 --> 30:32.920
I don't deserve it.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.560
Gisborne's taken your friends.

30:34.560 --> 30:38.000
They're to be put to death tomorrow.

30:43.680 --> 30:47.880
What should I do?What would Robin Hood do?

30:47.880 --> 30:51.920
Look into your heart, Robin.
You'll find the answer.

31:05.960 --> 31:07.480
Hello, boys!

31:11.120 --> 31:13.840
Everything you need to
make your stay comfortable?

31:13.840 --> 31:17.520
No, we seem to have missed out
on the welcoming beaker of mead.

31:17.520 --> 31:21.800
Now, to keep you up to speed
with my schedule...

31:24.200 --> 31:26.760
Grrr! Ha-ha!

31:26.760 --> 31:29.840
There's a ceremony
coming up tomorrow

31:29.840 --> 31:33.520
to mark the final passing of your
chief and his shoddy little outfit.

31:33.520 --> 31:36.120
Your ritual demise.

31:36.120 --> 31:38.120
Oh, I do like a good execution.

31:38.120 --> 31:41.160
So, your last evening on this earth.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.120
And you with your old friends!

31:45.240 --> 31:48.080
Enjoy!

31:48.080 --> 31:52.000
Hey, what time you serving dinner?
Ha-ha-ha! Very good.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.800
You're right.

32:03.800 --> 32:07.840
I can't just turn my back
on people who need me.

32:07.840 --> 32:10.360
So what are you gonna do?

32:10.360 --> 32:13.920
Well, first, I'm gonna
try and rescue my men.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.560
Tonight?

32:15.560 --> 32:18.760
All alone?Unless you've got a better idea?

32:19.800 --> 32:22.560
Well...

32:22.560 --> 32:25.920
Actually, I do.

32:25.920 --> 32:27.840
Oh, do you?

32:27.840 --> 32:29.600
Well, are you gonna tell me?

32:39.280 --> 32:41.440
Give it to me. Come on.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.000
This is hopeless.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.240
Your best chance for success
tomorrow is rest.

32:52.240 --> 32:56.960
And what chance do my men have
if I can't even sharpen an
arrow, let alone fire one? Hey?

32:56.960 --> 32:58.480
Have faith, Robin.

32:58.480 --> 33:02.320
You won't be alone.

33:07.240 --> 33:09.640
Here.

33:12.120 --> 33:15.720
Where did you get that? It was
round your neck when I found you.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.200
Thank you.

33:33.520 --> 33:37.440
What happens to the moon tomorrow
happens once in a generation.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.600
It's God's gift from the stars.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.560
My father used to
say that when we die,

33:45.560 --> 33:48.080
we become stars.

33:48.080 --> 33:51.840
If it's true, this time tomorrow we
could be lighting up the night sky.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.720
That's a glorious thought.

34:41.560 --> 34:46.800
A great day - for Nottingham,
its people and homeland security.

34:51.400 --> 34:55.840
To mark the extermination
of the terrorist, Hood,

34:55.840 --> 34:59.000
we shall execute his rabble.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.800
Prepare to fire.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.280
If they had respected the
Sheriff and his authority,

35:06.280 --> 35:09.480
they could have avoided punishment
of this severity, and lived

35:09.480 --> 35:13.920
peaceful, rewarding lives,
working for the good of this
great Shire of Nottingham.

35:13.920 --> 35:19.280
These men made a choice to live
their lives as outlaws, and now
they will receive their just reward

35:19.280 --> 35:23.520
for refusing to abide by the laws of
this great, great nation -

35:23.520 --> 35:26.720
the fatal consequence
of defying Prince John

35:26.720 --> 35:33.320
and the authority vested in me,
the Sheriff of Nottingham. Fire!

35:41.080 --> 35:43.760
Well, at least it's notWhat?

35:43.760 --> 35:46.800
People will be talking of
this for years, John. Great(!)

35:46.800 --> 35:48.480
Ha-ha! Tasty!

35:48.480 --> 35:50.040
Told you it was good! Mmm?

35:59.920 --> 36:05.240
NOTTINGHAM: Let's do it!
This time make it flaming.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.520
Wait!

36:10.400 --> 36:12.440
A last prayer, Sir Guy.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.800
We must be merciful no matter
how great the crime.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.400
Who are you, preacher man?

36:16.400 --> 36:19.320
Brother Tuck. He's the man
who brought these outlaws to justice.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.880
Sheriff?

36:20.880 --> 36:23.120
It is sinful to offer
no chance of absolution.

36:24.680 --> 36:28.880
Very well, chop chop.
These boys have got a hot date.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.520
Da, quaesumus Dominus,

36:34.520 --> 36:38.640
ut in hora mortis nostrae
Sacramentis refecti

36:38.640 --> 36:41.040
et culpis omnibus expiati...

36:45.880 --> 36:48.920
In sinum misericordiae tuae laeti...

36:48.920 --> 36:51.680
Always the same, these monks.

36:51.680 --> 36:54.360
All right, all right.
That's enough of the piety.

36:54.360 --> 36:57.720
No amount of lah de dah words
can save their blackened souls.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.760
Fire it up! Wait!

36:59.760 --> 37:02.640
In the name of God, wait!

37:02.640 --> 37:07.720
What are you doing? You and your

37:07.720 --> 37:09.880
And for this you will be punished!What?

37:09.880 --> 37:13.840
The monk's been at the mushrooms.
Fire it! Soon, God will speak,

37:13.840 --> 37:16.520
the skies will darken and
the sun will disappear.

37:21.120 --> 37:24.160
He was right!

37:24.160 --> 37:27.640
There! It's happening!

37:29.880 --> 37:34.400
Have faith, for soon a new day
will dawn and you will be saved!

37:34.400 --> 37:36.760
What's happening here?

37:36.760 --> 37:38.280
It's a trick.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.480
Hood.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.880
Robin!

37:42.880 --> 37:46.480
Fire! Fire!

37:46.480 --> 37:49.520
For out of this darkness a legend
will rise. Hope will be re-born.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.720
If you want something
doing properly...!

37:54.920 --> 37:57.840
Filthy peasants,
don't anybody touch me!

37:57.840 --> 38:03.480
A new dawn is coming. The sun will
rise again over England's towns..

38:03.480 --> 38:07.080
I'll give you something to smile
about, you whimpering pansies!

38:11.920 --> 38:14.120
Where have they gone?

38:21.920 --> 38:26.920
You see? The sun emerges again,
like England's protector.

38:26.920 --> 38:31.840
His journey is complete. He appears
into the light and he will save you!

38:31.840 --> 38:35.920
He has returned!
The legend is alive!

38:35.920 --> 38:38.960
Surprise, surprise!

38:38.960 --> 38:41.160
No, it can't be.

38:41.160 --> 38:43.440
You incompetent fool!

38:48.640 --> 38:50.160
No!

38:52.280 --> 38:57.400
I am Robin Hood,
your humble servant.

38:57.400 --> 39:01.920
It is for you that I live to fight
the evil that chokes this country.

39:01.920 --> 39:07.040
No longer shall we live in fear
and darkness.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.120
We must stand together.

39:10.120 --> 39:17.880
Only then will the sun rise on this
country, our England, once more!

39:17.880 --> 39:20.280
Yeah!

39:25.160 --> 39:26.680
Get him!

39:26.680 --> 39:29.000
Robin, a gift from the Sheriff!

39:46.760 --> 39:50.120
Robin? No!

39:53.200 --> 39:54.760
Do it.

39:54.760 --> 39:58.440
What? End it, please. You want this?

39:58.440 --> 40:00.480
I live in hell.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.840
Then stay there. Agh!

40:19.880 --> 40:26.560
Today's humiliation has wrecked
your authority, with your people
and Prince John -

40:26.560 --> 40:28.240
when I tell him.

40:28.240 --> 40:31.280
Back to London at last!

40:31.280 --> 40:33.080
Goodbye, little people.

40:44.680 --> 40:48.480
You pathetic misery-addled mess.

40:48.480 --> 40:51.440
You're teetering on the edge
of dispensability, Gisborne.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.320
Make sure you don't fall off.

40:54.840 --> 40:58.280
You know, I've finally come to the
conclusion that I don't like you.

40:58.280 --> 41:03.640
Aw, aw, whassa matter? Mmm?

41:03.640 --> 41:07.920
Was that nasty Robin Hood horrible
to our little Guy? Ooh, diddums!

41:11.080 --> 41:15.040
That's better. You'd better show
some spine. You're gonna need it.

41:15.040 --> 41:20.400
Hood gave you life, now you
go out and take his, right?

41:25.120 --> 41:29.000
Now, listen, they'll come at you
with everything they have now.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.240
Are you ready? Well, they
haven't seen anything yet.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.520
Not now there's a warrior
priest on their case, hey?

41:35.520 --> 41:37.080
Tuck's joining our fight, lads.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.520
He's one of us now.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.320
These are yours.

41:43.960 --> 41:48.520
Hold on. You haven't explained how
Gisborne knew where to find us yet.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.760
Sometimes you have to risk
a lot to win a lot.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.760
It worked. This time.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.760
Next time you risk your own neck.
I will.

41:58.760 --> 42:01.400
And happily. You know I
can't do this without you.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.400
Any of you.

42:03.400 --> 42:09.280
And I didn't mean those things
I said. I'm sorry.

42:09.280 --> 42:13.600
Robin, it's all right.

42:13.600 --> 42:17.600
We understand. What happened today
will reverberate around England.

42:17.600 --> 42:22.080
The story told around every fire,
and every child's bed,

42:22.080 --> 42:26.280
of how the sun itself intervened
in the fight against evil.

42:26.280 --> 42:28.880
The Sheriff eclipsed.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.080
A legend reborn.

43:02.360 --> 43:03.880
I'll never stop loving you.

43:21.040 --> 43:23.760
You're gonna be soldiers, all of ya!

43:23.760 --> 43:25.480
So say goodbye to your families.

43:25.480 --> 43:30.400
You men, you belong to me now.
You fight well for my cause.

43:30.400 --> 43:33.120
Some of you may live
to see your homes again.

43:33.120 --> 43:35.400
To the next King of Ireland,
my brother.

43:35.400 --> 43:38.560
Who's that?
Oh, some girl we just saved.

43:38.560 --> 43:40.440
My name is Kate.

43:40.440 --> 43:42.800
I am the Sheriff of Nottingham!

43:42.800 --> 43:45.560
You can kill me 100 times over but
the pain you're feeling now...

43:45.560 --> 43:46.720
Hood!

43:46.720 --> 43:48.640
It's never gonna go away.
