*** SONG LIVES FOR EVER ***

00:35.505 --> 00:37.458
Oh, this isn't awkward.

00:37.516 --> 00:39.380
It's tradition, sweet pea.

00:39.380 --> 00:40.852
Dad, I have told you,

00:40.852 --> 00:43.240
please don't call me "Sweet Pea"
or "Honey" while we're working,

00:43.240 --> 00:44.690
or at the station.

00:44.715 --> 00:47.894
You know, it's hard enough for me to
get the guys to take me seriously.

00:47.919 --> 00:50.263
OK, Officer McCullers.

00:50.263 --> 00:52.807
You can never make
anything easy, can you?

00:52.948 --> 00:54.441
You know what?
Screw 'em!

00:54.469 --> 00:55.789
Let them think what
they're gonna think.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.607
You're gonna blow right by them
when you get your gold shield, anyway.

00:58.662 --> 01:00.630
I'm gonna be running the station.

01:01.918 --> 01:05.277
I don't know how I'm gonna feel
about that, working for my daughter.

01:05.302 --> 01:07.639
Oh, don't worry.
I won't play favorites.

01:07.639 --> 01:10.157
I wouldn't expect anything less.

01:15.624 --> 01:18.481
Damn! I thought it was
gonna be a slow night!

01:28.066 --> 01:30.397
Chris, wait for back-up!

01:30.422 --> 01:31.839
Hang on!

01:36.569 --> 01:37.962
Freeze!

01:44.097 --> 01:45.966
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

01:45.991 --> 01:48.369
Jesus! What do you think
you're doing?

01:48.369 --> 01:49.823
Get over here!

01:51.743 --> 01:53.682
- You've any weapons on you?
- No.

01:53.682 --> 01:56.571
- You look 14, kid.
- I'm 15.

01:58.141 --> 01:59.481
Is this what's this is about?

01:59.481 --> 02:02.954
Look, I was hungry, OK?
My mum hasn't been home in days.

02:05.313 --> 02:09.929
I'm sorry, kid. I'm still gonna have to
take you down to the station. You just...

02:11.863 --> 02:13.985
You don't have to do this.

02:14.776 --> 02:16.578
Put the gun down.

02:20.819 --> 02:24.261
- Just out the gun down.
- You don't understand.

02:24.286 --> 02:26.268
I'm coming in, Chris!

03:08.221 --> 03:10.888
No! No!
Dad!

03:32.905 --> 03:34.325
First responder's on the scene.

03:34.325 --> 03:37.451
Officer in need of assistance.
Tower Two, the Kelly Court Project.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.557
65 in progress.

03:41.969 --> 03:46.870
Officer 2-20, hold position.
2-10 is flying in. ETA three minutes.

03:50.802 --> 03:53.492
911. What's your emergency?

03:54.760 --> 03:57.003
911. What's your emergency?

03:57.003 --> 03:59.731
<i>- There's a Boogeyman in the house.</i>
- Are you sure?

03:59.832 --> 04:02.284
<i>He's big and scary, so I'm hiding.</i>

04:02.406 --> 04:05.490
- Where are your parents?
<i>- You think he'll find me?</i>

04:06.174 --> 04:09.075
Listen, kid, everything's gonna be all right.
You just need to go back to bed...

04:09.075 --> 04:11.245
- He'll be gone in the morning.
<i>- But... the monster?</i>

04:11.270 --> 04:14.748
Listen, kid, this isn't a baby-sitting
service to coddle you after a nightmare.

04:14.753 --> 04:18.089
You need to hang up so this line
can remain open for emergencies.

04:18.136 --> 04:20.055
<i>I tried to warn JH.</i>

04:20.132 --> 04:22.023
- Who's JH?
<i>- He's my friend.</i>

04:22.023 --> 04:24.488
<i>Our parents are friends,
so we're friends.</i>

04:24.488 --> 04:27.577
- Is he OK?
<i>- I think so but he wouldn't listen.</i>

04:27.577 --> 04:29.222
<i>He's upstairs sleeping.</i>

04:29.222 --> 04:31.241
Which is what you should be doing!

04:31.241 --> 04:33.570
If not, I'm gonna send
over some real scary man

04:33.570 --> 04:36.027
to arrest you for tying
up an emergency line.

04:36.116 --> 04:38.192
<i>- But...</i>
- I'm gonna give you to the count of three...

04:38.192 --> 04:41.204
One, two, three...

04:42.302 --> 04:44.044
Are you still there?

04:45.161 --> 04:47.404
No response.
Call terminated.

04:47.764 --> 04:49.256
- 911...
<i>- She's not breathing...!</i>

04:49.256 --> 04:51.866
<i>- She's not breathing!</i>
- OK, Sir? I need you to calm down.

04:51.866 --> 04:53.781
I'm gonna send some help on the way.

04:53.781 --> 04:55.529
Is she turning blue?

04:55.529 --> 04:56.614
<i>No, she doesn't have any color.</i>

04:56.614 --> 04:58.696
Sir, that's a good thing.
That means she's still getting oxygen.

04:58.696 --> 05:01.092
<i>I don't know, she may be Grey...</i>

05:50.599 --> 05:53.074
Here we go.
Are you eating with us tonight?

05:53.236 --> 05:55.319
Why not?
The usual.

05:55.319 --> 05:56.823
You got it.

06:39.431 --> 06:43.420
Keep pushing against my hand.
As long as you can. Keep pushing.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.477
Good. Good. Good. Good.

06:46.477 --> 06:47.692
All right.

06:47.771 --> 06:50.057
OK.
It's loosening up.

06:50.138 --> 06:53.086
Does that mean I'll be able
to run in the Labor Day 5K?

06:53.086 --> 06:55.315
In a couple of years.

06:56.098 --> 07:00.294
Look, it's gonna take about two
years for you to get full mobility.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.718
And what's up with you answering
the door without a brace?

07:02.766 --> 07:04.446
Hey! OK!

07:04.446 --> 07:05.783
I get it!

07:05.783 --> 07:07.048
No, you don't.

07:09.552 --> 07:11.044
What about the pain?

07:11.044 --> 07:13.013
Is there something else
you can give me for it?

07:13.013 --> 07:15.491
Not if you wanna keep
working and driving.

07:15.491 --> 07:17.189
It'll subside, eventually...

07:17.189 --> 07:19.329
The fact that you can push at all...

07:19.712 --> 07:21.847
That's a step in the right direction.

07:21.847 --> 07:24.042
- Pun intended?
- Chris...

07:24.042 --> 07:25.829
You almost lost your leg...

07:25.829 --> 07:28.418
Nerve, muscle damage...
It doesn't heal overnight,

07:28.418 --> 07:30.183
not even in the next month.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.198
You need to be patient.

07:47.771 --> 07:48.934
What?

07:56.562 --> 07:57.724
Hey...

07:58.860 --> 08:01.448
- Arnold. - Chris?
- Yeah.

08:01.554 --> 08:02.636
New partner?

08:02.661 --> 08:04.998
This is Cortez,
she came up through the Valley.

08:04.998 --> 08:07.143
Aah, good people over there.

08:07.143 --> 08:10.025
Is Sergeant Parks still there?
Chewing ass?

08:10.050 --> 08:12.155
Like it's his last meal.

08:12.842 --> 08:15.202
So, what's this about?

08:15.202 --> 08:16.715
Chris, have a seat.

08:21.456 --> 08:22.917
Yeah, go ahead.

08:25.732 --> 08:28.063
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

08:28.063 --> 08:30.639
<i>- There's a Boogeyman in the house.
- Are you sure?</i>

08:30.664 --> 08:33.068
<i>He's big and scary, so I'm hiding.</i>

08:33.453 --> 08:36.719
<i>- Where are your parents?
- You think he'll find me?</i>

08:37.306 --> 08:40.159
<i>Listen, kid, everything's gonna be all right.
You just need to go back to bed...</i>

08:40.159 --> 08:42.150
<i>- He'll be gone in the morning.
- But... the monster?</i>

08:42.150 --> 08:45.698
<i>Listen, kid, this isn't a baby-sitting
service to coddle you after a nightmare.</i>

08:45.723 --> 08:48.894
<i>You need to hang up so this line
can remain open for emergencies.</i>

08:48.956 --> 08:50.950
<i>I tried to warn JH.</i>

08:50.950 --> 08:52.967
<i>- Who's JH?
- He's my friend.</i>

08:52.967 --> 08:55.329
<i>Our parents are friends,
so we're friends.</i>

08:55.329 --> 08:58.449
<i>- Is he OK?
- I think so but he wouldn't listen.</i>

08:58.449 --> 09:01.872
<i>- He's upstairs sleeping.
- Which is what you should be doing!</i>

09:01.872 --> 09:03.408
<i>If not, I'm gonna send
over some...</i>

09:03.408 --> 09:04.709
All right, that's enough.

09:04.709 --> 09:06.654
<i>...to arrest you for tying
up an emergency line.</i>

09:09.064 --> 09:10.668
Last night...

09:11.278 --> 09:16.206
John Henry Blalock was found murdered
in his home at 1240 Braxton Street.

09:16.904 --> 09:19.169
John Henry,
is that the kid from the call?

09:19.169 --> 09:23.533
John Henry, JH. The other kid,
the caller was in the house with him.

09:23.558 --> 09:25.573
You know,
I have to say. it's...

09:25.573 --> 09:27.716
hard being in a murder scene and

09:27.716 --> 09:31.105
discover that 911 was dialed
around the time of death.

09:32.422 --> 09:35.347
So, what do you...
what do you need from me?

09:35.347 --> 09:37.148
Just a couple of questions.

09:37.284 --> 09:40.733
- You might want your union rep for this.
- No.

09:40.931 --> 09:42.742
Look, they're just gonna tell me
to keep my mouth shut

09:42.742 --> 09:44.713
and that will slow down
the investigation.

09:44.747 --> 09:46.700
So you understand your rights?

09:48.449 --> 09:49.519
Yeah.

09:50.660 --> 09:54.547
Was there anything on that tape that we
can't hear? Anything that struck you?

09:56.600 --> 09:57.795
OK, I...

09:57.795 --> 10:02.742
I thought it was just some kid messing
around, making up a story, I...

10:03.165 --> 10:05.919
Ted was bashed-in with a hammer.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.623
Where were his parents?

10:12.623 --> 10:14.751
A couple of drunks, out...

10:14.751 --> 10:18.495
getting wasted with the neighbour,
that's who the caller belonged to.

10:18.495 --> 10:20.452
Their story is they came
home and found him

10:20.452 --> 10:22.527
but it's looking
like they did it.

10:23.429 --> 10:24.757
No, he...

10:24.782 --> 10:27.723
He said there was somebody there,
a boogeyman.

10:27.775 --> 10:30.348
There's a history of
violence in this home.

10:30.348 --> 10:33.410
A pattern of them going out,
coming home and hurting their kid.

10:33.410 --> 10:35.735
Evidently the caller didn't know this.

10:35.859 --> 10:37.779
That was the Boogeyman.

10:37.864 --> 10:42.185
If I had thought that
they were in danger in any way...

10:42.277 --> 10:45.102
I would've sent somebody, I'd...

10:45.428 --> 10:50.250
There were other calls flooding in
that had higher priority. I...

10:50.250 --> 10:51.672
I thought...

10:52.670 --> 10:56.558
You know, I thought that they were
putting somebody else's life in danger,

10:56.558 --> 10:59.766
I needed to get to that next call.

11:00.714 --> 11:01.841
In the...

11:42.347 --> 11:43.989
You all right?

11:44.525 --> 11:45.968
Super.

11:48.227 --> 11:50.713
I'm gonna need to place you on leave.

11:53.909 --> 11:55.670
I need this job.

11:55.670 --> 11:57.132
No, you don't.

11:57.132 --> 11:59.411
Disability cover everything
you'll ever need.

11:59.411 --> 12:01.066
That's not what I mean.

12:01.066 --> 12:02.670
Standard operating procedure.

12:02.670 --> 12:04.997
When an incident like this happens,
I'm required to put you on leave...

12:04.997 --> 12:06.862
until the Review Board.

12:08.967 --> 12:10.664
It's just the way it is.

13:24.368 --> 13:25.783
Hey!

13:25.783 --> 13:27.077
Miss me?

13:27.077 --> 13:28.768
Double!

13:31.848 --> 13:33.171
Thanks.

13:37.375 --> 13:38.778
Hey!

13:39.076 --> 13:40.966
You feel like darts?

13:41.395 --> 13:44.539
- You're wasting your time.
- And why is that?

13:47.009 --> 13:50.478
So? I said darts, not sprints.

13:50.662 --> 13:53.013
I'm assuming you got that
on the line of duty?

13:53.695 --> 13:56.305
That being the case,
I can hardly hold it against you.

13:57.361 --> 14:00.125
Thanks.
Very gracious of you.

14:01.198 --> 14:05.584
You know, I was gonna come up last
night but I didn't approach because...

14:05.624 --> 14:08.179
Being on the street,
I've learnt to read people.

14:08.179 --> 14:10.721
My timing would've got me shot down.

14:11.483 --> 14:14.294
Shot down?
Is that supposed to be funny?

14:15.723 --> 14:18.859
Wrong choice of words.
Sorry.

14:20.974 --> 14:22.348
Yup.

14:24.901 --> 14:27.136
OK, let's try this again.

14:27.456 --> 14:29.851
Why don't you give me your cell-phone
number? I will call you up,

14:29.851 --> 14:32.249
and ask you out
on a proper date?

14:32.643 --> 14:34.312
I don't have one.

14:34.932 --> 14:37.530
There are four-year-olds
who have cell phones.

14:37.555 --> 14:39.406
Yeah, well, I have a
phone on my ear all day.

14:39.406 --> 14:42.297
The last thing I want is to
have one on my time off.

14:43.020 --> 14:45.211
Look, who's putting you up to this?

14:46.051 --> 14:47.326
No one.

14:47.783 --> 14:49.855
You didn't lose a bet
or something?

14:51.083 --> 14:55.103
All I was looking for was the chance
to buy an attractive woman a drink.

14:58.770 --> 15:00.266
Just one?

15:03.549 --> 15:05.738
OK. Yeah.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.110
Light?

15:13.489 --> 15:15.591
OK, easy, Stumbles.

15:15.591 --> 15:16.864
Let's get you to bed.

15:16.864 --> 15:19.329
- And you're not turning me?
- No!

15:25.402 --> 15:28.570
- I got it.
- Relax, I'm just trying to help.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.479
It's attractive, isn’t it?

15:38.712 --> 15:39.824
Stop!

15:40.979 --> 15:42.493
- Stop!
- OK!

15:56.539 --> 15:58.950
Good-night, detective.

16:19.724 --> 16:23.275
Hey, Chris! I just wanted to see
how you're doing this morning,

16:23.275 --> 16:26.305
and I needed to let you know
your review will be tomorrow,

16:26.305 --> 16:28.273
Tuesday, 24th at 10.

16:28.273 --> 16:30.916
Nothing like headlines
to expedite these things, right?

16:30.916 --> 16:33.559
Anyway, if there's anything you need
or if you have any questions,

16:33.559 --> 16:35.860
please, give me a call in my office.

16:35.885 --> 16:37.445
Take care of yourself.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.958
- I should have followed through.
- For one phone call? - Yeah, I mean...

18:07.043 --> 18:08.260
Hey!

18:08.418 --> 18:09.773
What are you doing here?

18:09.773 --> 18:11.831
Reporters have
swarmed my place!

18:11.831 --> 18:13.509
You brought it on yourself.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.618
We did what we could
to keep it quiet,

18:15.618 --> 18:17.531
but the parents or the
parents attorneys

18:17.531 --> 18:19.667
went out to divert some
attention from them.

18:19.684 --> 18:22.319
They made a sensational case
that much more sensational.

18:22.455 --> 18:25.025
Parents kill kid with a hammer,
whose cries for help go unheard

18:25.025 --> 18:26.918
by the person whose
sole purpose...

18:26.918 --> 18:28.684
is to hear those cries.

18:28.784 --> 18:29.998
I wanna help.

18:29.998 --> 18:32.261
Well, you gave us your statement.
That's all you can do.

18:32.261 --> 18:33.799
You know I can do more than that.

18:33.799 --> 18:36.165
I'm not some High School graduate
bound to a dispatch chair.

18:36.165 --> 18:37.551
Chris, we're good.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.237
The case is coming together
around the parents.

18:40.885 --> 18:42.352
The kid said that something...

18:42.352 --> 18:44.309
Just chalked it up to another story.

18:44.384 --> 18:46.663
'Cos kids make up stories.

18:46.789 --> 18:48.074
Right?

18:49.788 --> 18:53.390
Chris, look, I know things
are really rough right now.

18:53.722 --> 18:56.329
But trust me,
all this noise is gonna go away

18:56.329 --> 18:58.857
the minute they find another story
to pump to the new cycle.

18:58.857 --> 19:03.085
In the meantime, just find some place
to lay low for a couple of days.

19:03.110 --> 19:04.571
OK?

19:16.744 --> 19:18.417
Hey, Kurt.

19:19.066 --> 19:20.921
Hey, what are you doing here?

19:21.046 --> 19:23.721
You hear about what happened?

19:23.721 --> 19:24.961
Yeah.

19:24.986 --> 19:26.211
That's rough.

19:27.028 --> 19:30.180
- Are you doing OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

19:31.893 --> 19:34.467
Look, I know that
this may be asking a lot but...

19:34.534 --> 19:37.412
I was wondering if I could
crush at your place.

19:37.437 --> 19:40.666
It'd just be for a couple of nights.
The press is camped out at my apartment,

19:40.666 --> 19:42.323
and I just...
I really need to get away.

19:42.323 --> 19:44.749
I wish I could,
I just can't because my...

19:44.749 --> 19:47.178
son's in town with his two sons,

19:47.178 --> 19:49.984
and we're full house.
I'm sorry.

19:49.984 --> 19:51.517
No problem.

19:51.665 --> 19:55.449
If you want... do you need money
for a motel or something?

19:55.471 --> 19:58.742
No, no, I could never
take money from you.

19:58.782 --> 20:03.302
I owed your Dad a lot of money
just from the pool games I lost to him.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.695
No, no, I'm good, I'm good.

20:07.742 --> 20:10.279
Come by again, OK?

20:10.304 --> 20:11.852
Definitely.

20:21.748 --> 20:24.321
Please note that the
operator under review, 2304,

20:24.321 --> 20:27.280
Christine McCullers has
refused representation.

20:27.549 --> 20:30.650
We're here to determine what happened
on the night of Saturday, May 22nd...

20:30.650 --> 20:32.390
and what procedure broke down.

20:32.378 --> 20:36.100
And to determine if any responsibility
lies with operator 2304.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.853
So, Miss McCullers,
do you have an opening statement?

20:40.690 --> 20:41.690
No.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.393
Play the call.

20:46.818 --> 20:48.975
911. What's your emergency?

20:48.975 --> 20:51.587
<i>- There's a Boogeyman in the house.
- Are you sure?</i>

20:51.825 --> 20:54.227
<i>He's big and scary, so I'm hiding.</i>

20:54.500 --> 20:57.508
<i>- Where are your parents?
- You think he'll find me?</i>

20:58.409 --> 21:01.179
<i>Listen, kid, everything's gonna be all right.
You just need to go back to bed...</i>

21:01.179 --> 21:03.213
<i>- He'll be gone in the morning.
- But... the monster?</i>

21:03.213 --> 21:06.669
<i>Listen, kid, this isn't a baby-sitting
service to coddle you after a nightmare.</i>

21:06.669 --> 21:10.176
<i>You need to hang up so this line
can remain open for emergencies.</i>

21:10.219 --> 21:12.055
<i>I tried to warn JH.</i>

21:12.055 --> 21:14.092
<i>- Who's JH?
- He's my friend.</i>

21:14.092 --> 21:16.620
<i>Our parents are friends,
so we're friends.</i>

21:16.620 --> 21:19.115
<i>- Is he OK?
- I think so but he wouldn't listen.</i>

21:19.936 --> 21:21.873
Miss McCullers'
supervisor, Janet Burke

21:21.873 --> 21:24.986
has requested to speak on
operator's 2304's behalf.

21:26.387 --> 21:29.047
I've been in Chris' position before.

21:29.569 --> 21:33.530
For over 20 years,
I sat where Chris sits.

21:34.420 --> 21:39.095
It's not easy to be judged
for a split second decision,

21:39.176 --> 21:44.221
that can be carefully analyzed
later over hours, days, weeks...

21:44.547 --> 21:48.438
This was a bad decision
that had a horrible outcome.

21:48.515 --> 21:51.102
But that should not ruin her career.

21:51.506 --> 21:55.694
She's a good operator
and she deserves to be on the job.

21:56.281 --> 22:00.233
The MDC is better with her around.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.759
Is there anything else
that needs to be presented?

22:05.073 --> 22:07.865
All right, we will take a break
while we discuss our ruling.

22:07.887 --> 22:10.901
Let's reconvene at two o'clock.

22:15.148 --> 22:18.799
Excuse me, do you have an extra
copy of the call transcript?

22:33.943 --> 22:35.190
Hey.

22:35.945 --> 22:37.354
What are you doing here?

22:37.354 --> 22:39.957
You are like a Nat
we just can't swallow.

22:40.773 --> 22:42.496
I was re-reading the call transcripts...

22:42.496 --> 22:45.281
- Chris...
- We don't need help with this investigation.

22:45.872 --> 22:47.611
I'm getting some coffee.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.420
- Do you still make the parents for it?
- Yeah.

22:51.445 --> 22:55.619
- What are they saying?
- They're pleading not guilty, big surprise.

22:55.978 --> 22:59.489
- Capital case to be expected.
- Assume they're not guilty.

22:59.489 --> 23:02.681
No forced entry.
A history of violence in the home...

23:02.681 --> 23:05.961
We can place them at the scene
near the time of the death...

23:05.961 --> 23:07.220
What more
do we need?

23:07.220 --> 23:10.365
Don't you find it odd that the kid
didn't identify the Blalocks?

23:10.365 --> 23:14.211
- Chris, it doesn't mean anything.
- It could mean something.

23:17.727 --> 23:19.099
Why are you doing this?

23:19.099 --> 23:20.510
I want justice.

23:20.510 --> 23:24.453
Maybe this is about something else.
Maybe this is about your Dad.

23:25.911 --> 23:29.443
- It's about justice.
- But Chris...

23:30.811 --> 23:32.843
Suppose I find something...

23:32.896 --> 23:36.254
that lends just a little bit of
credibility to another theory...

23:36.279 --> 23:37.780
a Boogeyman theory...

23:37.780 --> 23:40.151
And the defense uses it
to cloud the Jury's mind,

23:40.151 --> 23:42.092
into thinking that
the parents are not guilty,

23:42.092 --> 23:44.670
when in fact they really
killed their kid.

23:44.983 --> 23:47.768
How would you help serve justice?

23:48.811 --> 23:51.567
And you really honor
your father properly?

23:54.742 --> 23:57.967
I'm telling you,
there's something here.

23:59.567 --> 24:02.603
OK, I'll keep it in mind.

24:02.790 --> 24:03.981
Thanks.

24:14.928 --> 24:16.728
Guess who I am?
Oh...

24:17.104 --> 24:19.628
I shouldn't laugh,
I shouldn't!

24:38.904 --> 24:41.403
We understand the pressure
this job entails,

24:41.403 --> 24:43.832
and we in no way condemn
Miss McCullers.

24:43.965 --> 24:47.631
It is regretful her decision led
to a child's death, but it did.

24:47.722 --> 24:49.983
So it is our recommendation
that Christine McCullers

24:49.983 --> 24:53.091
be suspended for a period of
two months... without pay.

24:53.167 --> 24:55.298
And during which time she
will be required to attend

24:55.298 --> 24:57.772
a six-week sensitivity course.

24:58.051 --> 24:59.543
We're dismissed.

25:04.362 --> 25:06.060
Hey, Chris...

25:06.398 --> 25:08.289
The ruling could've been better.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.991
It could've been worse,
way worse!

25:11.114 --> 25:13.842
If you hadn't said what you said, I...

25:14.879 --> 25:16.158
Thank you.

25:16.198 --> 25:19.263
For all the talk outside these walls,
I just wanted to make sure you get a fair deal.

25:19.263 --> 25:23.042
Look, nobody gets it unless
the sit in the chair.

25:23.191 --> 25:25.258
Look, I know what you're going through.

25:26.416 --> 25:30.628
Back in '92 I didn't dispatch a unit fast
enough when a kid was beaten to death.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.886
I had no idea.
I'm so sorry...

25:32.886 --> 25:34.450
But I learnt from it.

25:34.734 --> 25:37.633
And it made a stronger, better operator.

25:37.685 --> 25:42.021
Look, I meant what I said in there.
You've got a cop's instinct and we need that.

25:42.638 --> 25:43.638
Thanks.

25:45.349 --> 25:47.092
What are you gonna do?

25:49.875 --> 25:51.802
I'm gonna make this right.

26:26.395 --> 26:27.754
Hey!

26:28.342 --> 26:30.335
Finally ready to play a game?

26:30.834 --> 26:33.589
Look, have you heard
anything about the case?

26:34.030 --> 26:35.094
Case?

26:35.094 --> 26:37.862
My case. The one with
the kid and everything?

26:37.862 --> 26:39.934
Sorry.
I haven't heard anything.

26:40.441 --> 26:43.223
Look, I don't think it was the parents.

26:43.704 --> 26:46.984
- And why do you think that?
- Because the kid didn't identify them.

26:46.984 --> 26:48.113
So?

26:48.539 --> 26:49.925
You don't think that's weird?

26:49.925 --> 26:51.493
Who's on the case?

26:51.493 --> 26:53.836
They're with Arnold and Cortez.

26:54.039 --> 26:56.219
You need to leave it to them.

26:56.421 --> 26:59.748
Look, I can do a lot more than just
sit on my ass and answer phone calls.

27:00.675 --> 27:02.925
- I'm here for help.
- Help?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.672
Help you investigate a
detective's active case?

27:05.716 --> 27:09.944
Sorry, but no thank you. That is a real
quick way for me never to get a shield.

27:12.657 --> 27:14.276
Thanks for nothing.

27:14.465 --> 27:16.811
Is this gonna hurt my
chances for a date?

27:19.631 --> 27:21.206
You know what gets me?

27:21.206 --> 27:23.560
If I'm wrong about the parents,
then what's the harm?

27:23.560 --> 27:26.930
The killers are caught,
it's just a few man-hours that are wasted.

27:26.994 --> 27:30.619
But if I'm right,
there is a killer of a kid still out there.

27:30.619 --> 27:32.993
And the way this went down,
how it was pulled off...

27:33.195 --> 27:35.391
I don't think it's gonna
be the last time.

27:43.361 --> 27:47.237
Goaaaal!

27:47.262 --> 27:48.634
Yes!

27:56.804 --> 27:59.754
US needs this to win their
first ever World Cup.

27:59.970 --> 28:03.662
All left up to the luck of the youngest
player to ever fill the US jersey.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.962
Shit!

28:58.601 --> 28:59.941
Who is it?

29:00.066 --> 29:01.190
Police!

29:07.986 --> 29:09.448
Hey there!

29:09.448 --> 29:11.488
- Are you Stevie?
- Yeah.

29:11.937 --> 29:13.577
Is your Mom home?

29:14.910 --> 29:18.286
You - you tried to help your
friend the other night.

29:18.286 --> 29:20.471
Yeah, but he still got hurt.

29:21.773 --> 29:24.361
You thought you saw the Boogeyman?

29:24.625 --> 29:28.618
Yeah, he was like a shadow
but no one believes me.

29:30.134 --> 29:33.048
And you're sure
it wasn't Mr or Mrs Blalock?

29:33.088 --> 29:35.995
They aren't the Boogeyman.
That's crazy.

29:36.157 --> 29:38.681
Yeah, it is crazy.

29:40.154 --> 29:42.637
Thank you, Stevie.
You've been a lot of help.

29:45.460 --> 29:47.658
You keep this door locked, OK?

32:19.773 --> 32:21.184
Take that one.

32:21.541 --> 32:23.309
You got five minutes.

32:28.364 --> 32:29.912
Who the hell are you?

32:29.912 --> 32:32.376
I'm Officer Christine McCullers.

32:32.376 --> 32:34.750
- I'm the dispatcher...
- What are you doing here?

32:35.549 --> 32:37.521
I wanted to speak with you.

32:37.882 --> 32:40.765
You want forgiveness
for my kid getting killed?

32:40.920 --> 32:42.591
Screw you!

32:43.678 --> 32:45.663
I could never ask you to forgive me.

32:45.663 --> 32:49.531
You let some guy kill my son
and you don't wanna say sorry?

32:49.665 --> 32:52.685
- To hell with you!
- Look, I don't think you did it!

32:53.169 --> 32:54.755
Or your husband.

32:55.582 --> 32:58.582
I might be the only one.
I wanna help.

33:06.460 --> 33:09.753
Our lawyer keeps pressuring us
to take that plea.

33:10.882 --> 33:13.933
There ain't no way I'm gonna stand
before that Judge and God Almighty

33:13.933 --> 33:15.718
 to say that I killed my boy.

33:16.981 --> 33:19.994
Have there been any strange
people near the house lately?

33:21.983 --> 33:23.116
No.

33:26.547 --> 33:29.609
D'you remember anything odd
about the day he was killed?

33:33.066 --> 33:35.864
I don't - I don't remember much.

33:38.437 --> 33:41.989
I don't even know if
 I told JH "Good-night".

33:45.653 --> 33:48.639
I just remember blood...

33:49.090 --> 33:51.482
There was a lot of blood.

33:53.608 --> 33:56.765
He was always so scared.

34:02.520 --> 34:05.075
I hope he had his blue with him.

34:05.476 --> 34:07.419
It made him feel safe.

34:08.333 --> 34:09.922
What was his "Blue"?

34:10.047 --> 34:13.170
When he was a baby,
he had a blue blanket.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.782
Always had it with him.

34:17.083 --> 34:19.098
We struggled...

34:19.231 --> 34:21.784
And he struggled to let it go.
We struggled...

34:21.784 --> 34:24.007
that he wouldn't
carry it anymore.

34:24.382 --> 34:27.621
He got to school, the kids,
they made fun of him so bad.

34:28.097 --> 34:29.976
Did he carry it in High School?

34:29.976 --> 34:31.483
Hell, no.

34:32.186 --> 34:34.475
Before Middle School,
his Dad...

34:34.475 --> 34:36.808
He gave him one of his work bandanas.

34:36.893 --> 34:38.628
It was dark blue.

34:39.069 --> 34:42.639
He took it...
Accepted it as a replacement.

34:43.543 --> 34:44.889
That way, if he was...

34:45.341 --> 34:48.743
scared or nervous
or just needed good luck...

34:49.522 --> 34:51.493
He could have it with him.

34:52.614 --> 34:54.536
I hope he had his blue.

34:55.583 --> 34:57.803
It made him feel safe.

34:59.379 --> 35:03.020
I wish I could've made him feel safe.

35:08.354 --> 35:10.818
I wish I could've made him feel safer.

35:31.915 --> 35:36.149
When I said come visit again,
I didn't expect it to be this soon.

35:37.594 --> 35:40.868
- I need your advice.
- Sure. What is it?

35:41.221 --> 35:43.118
It's about the Blalock case.

35:43.118 --> 35:46.948
- I went to see the Mom.
- Chris, why would you do that?

35:46.948 --> 35:51.238
- They didn't do this.
- You can't get yourself mixed up in that.

35:51.436 --> 35:54.139
Dad always said
you were a great investigator.

35:54.218 --> 35:57.424
So you want me to be
an armchair detective?

35:57.482 --> 35:59.997
I only know what I read in the papers.

36:00.130 --> 36:01.762
How would you
approach this?

36:01.762 --> 36:05.825
Well, I wouldn't start by going door
to door, that'd be a waste of time.

36:06.248 --> 36:08.976
I'd go to the school,
I'd talk to his friends,

36:08.976 --> 36:11.346
find out what this
kid was about.

36:11.563 --> 36:13.218
OK, that's great.

36:16.025 --> 36:18.647
The Mom mentioned something
about a blue bandana...

36:18.647 --> 36:21.853
She said he always carried it with him,
specially when he was scared.

36:21.853 --> 36:25.747
Would you be able to check the inventory
to see if they bagged it at the scene?

36:25.747 --> 36:29.446
- Chris, you wanna make me lose my pension?
- No, of course not.

36:30.155 --> 36:32.857
I need to know
if she's telling the truth.

36:32.882 --> 36:34.264
I can't.

36:35.269 --> 36:37.096
I wanna fix this.

36:40.410 --> 36:42.246
Give me a minute.

37:02.893 --> 37:03.939
No.

37:04.058 --> 37:07.144
There's nothing like that
on the inventory sheet.

37:07.520 --> 37:08.520
OK.

37:10.392 --> 37:11.550
Thanks, Kurt.

37:11.596 --> 37:14.783
Now, get out of here
before you get us both in trouble.

37:32.346 --> 37:36.252
- Principal Lorton - Officer Chris McCullers.
- I'm Monty. - Hi.

37:36.277 --> 37:39.274
Sorry about the wait.
After school can always be a bit chaotic.

37:39.299 --> 37:42.712
I hope you don't mind but I asked
JH's Home Room teacher to join us.

37:42.712 --> 37:45.118
No, no, of course not.
Thank you for coming.

37:45.153 --> 37:47.425
- So, you're here about JH?
- Yeah.

37:47.485 --> 37:49.443
Tragic, just tragic.

37:49.443 --> 37:52.119
I knew his home life wasn't the best.

37:52.144 --> 37:54.514
But I never it'd get up like this.

37:54.514 --> 37:57.098
Oh, that's why we're here.
We're still investigating his death.

37:57.098 --> 37:58.630
But his parents,
we thought...

37:58.630 --> 38:00.334
With all the publicity
surrounding the case,

38:00.334 --> 38:03.829
we just wanna make sure his parents are
unable to amount any sort of defense.

38:03.854 --> 38:07.044
We wanna get out there in front of any
possible theories and discredit them.

38:07.069 --> 38:08.147
OK.

38:08.879 --> 38:11.672
Would it be possible for me
to speak to some of his friends?

38:11.811 --> 38:13.501
He was a quiet kid.

38:13.805 --> 38:15.228
Kept to himself.

38:15.228 --> 38:16.678
Was JH bullied?

38:16.678 --> 38:18.025
No, absolutely not.

38:18.025 --> 38:20.647
We have zero-tolerance policy
when it comes to that.

38:20.647 --> 38:23.285
Well, every school does
but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

38:23.324 --> 38:24.933
Was he being picked on?

38:25.368 --> 38:29.138
Right, the kids I see who get picked on
are the ones who

38:29.138 --> 38:32.192
put themselves out there in class...
They answer questions...

38:32.192 --> 38:34.468
They volunteer, do extra kind of work,
things like that.

38:34.468 --> 38:37.166
JH... He just wasn't that kid.

38:38.539 --> 38:40.593
Did he have a locker
that I could take a look at?

38:40.619 --> 38:42.132
It was cleared out.

38:42.157 --> 38:45.036
But I did keep the items
in a box for his...

38:46.644 --> 38:48.858
It's in my classroom.
I can take you.

38:48.912 --> 38:51.451
That'll be great. Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

38:51.476 --> 38:52.674
Thank you.

38:57.639 --> 39:01.029
He may not have been well-known
but he was one of us.

39:03.579 --> 39:07.054
I didn't want to speak out of turn
in front of Principal Lorton.

39:07.493 --> 39:10.621
But we did have some problems with
the janitor a few months ago.

39:11.018 --> 39:13.171
He got fired for being drunk and high.

39:13.382 --> 39:14.523
OK.

39:14.523 --> 39:17.606
Well, for months we had a rash
of locker thefts and we...

39:17.657 --> 39:20.613
Never proved it was him
but we all suspected.

39:20.645 --> 39:23.682
It could be nothing
but you said anything might help.

39:23.965 --> 39:26.251
What could he have taken from JH?

39:26.251 --> 39:27.945
That's why I remembered.

39:27.970 --> 39:29.970
On the day it all went down
and he got fired,

39:30.032 --> 39:32.483
JH was the one to
actually turn him in...

39:32.483 --> 39:36.685
for acting strange, and that's how we
found out about the booze and the drugs.

41:23.727 --> 41:25.407
- Kyle Hall?
- Yeah?

41:25.407 --> 41:27.259
I've a couple of questions for you.

41:27.259 --> 41:28.993
Now's not a good time.

41:30.433 --> 41:33.451
If you don't open the door,
I'm gonna let your parole officer know

41:33.451 --> 41:36.493
that you were uncooperative
in an on-going investigation.

41:43.899 --> 41:45.485
I don't know why you're here.

41:45.485 --> 41:48.018
I wanna talk to you about
your job over at that school.

41:48.043 --> 41:49.686
I don't work there no more.

41:49.711 --> 41:53.099
Yeah, because you were getting drunk
and high and stealing from the kids.

41:53.099 --> 41:54.899
I was in a bad place.

41:54.899 --> 41:56.335
But I'm clean.

41:56.335 --> 41:59.206
OK, I'm clean. Back then,
I needed money for my affliction.

41:59.206 --> 42:01.469
Don't think that
I don't feel bad for what I've done.

42:01.531 --> 42:04.493
I know it was wrong...
stealing from them...

42:04.493 --> 42:06.585
- Is that all you did?
- Yeah.

42:06.610 --> 42:07.926
Of course!

42:08.360 --> 42:11.029
Did you kill that kid Saturday night?

42:11.871 --> 42:13.008
What?

42:14.867 --> 42:19.058
I may be an addict,
I may be a thief, but I'm no killer.

42:19.253 --> 42:22.031
- Where were you Saturday night?
- I was...

42:22.347 --> 42:23.840
I was right here.

42:24.142 --> 42:26.694
- That's not a very good alibi.
- It's the truth!

42:26.694 --> 42:29.454
Well, that kid who reported you
and got you fired from your job,

42:29.454 --> 42:31.794
he was killed Saturday night
not too far from here.

42:31.794 --> 42:36.029
I didn't do it, OK? That kid freeing
me up, he probably saved my life.

42:36.029 --> 42:37.241
How self aware.

42:37.241 --> 42:39.552
Oh, you can't put this on me,
not something I didn't do.

42:39.552 --> 42:42.886
- How'd you smash his head?
- Don't do this to me, I'm not going back in...

42:42.886 --> 42:44.640
How did you do it?
- I'm not going back in.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.902
How did you do it? I'm
not going back in there!

42:48.209 --> 42:49.595
Did you kill him?

42:49.595 --> 42:54.465
I didn't do it! I didn't kill him!
I didn't do it.

42:58.220 --> 43:00.051
Where's the stuff?

43:00.146 --> 43:01.555
What stuff?

43:01.555 --> 43:03.717
Where is the stuff that
you stole from the locker?

43:03.717 --> 43:05.263
I don't know what
you're talking about.

43:05.263 --> 43:08.522
Yes, you do!
Where is the stuff you stole?

43:08.563 --> 43:09.856
All right.

43:10.956 --> 43:12.396
OK, OK.

43:12.396 --> 43:14.166
Hands up!

43:23.237 --> 43:24.596
Easy!

43:29.667 --> 43:31.592
Put it on the table.

43:34.542 --> 43:36.015
Open it.

43:44.560 --> 43:46.287
Step back.

43:46.341 --> 43:48.027
And put your hands up!

43:56.002 --> 43:57.866
Where's the bandana?

43:58.183 --> 43:59.801
Bandana?
What bandana?

43:59.801 --> 44:01.041
Where's the bandana?

44:01.041 --> 44:04.107
I don't know. I swear
That's it. That's all I have.

44:04.107 --> 44:07.463
I didn't do anything to that kid!
I swear!

46:07.326 --> 46:09.418
Hey, come on in.

46:11.218 --> 46:12.309
What's that?

46:12.334 --> 46:13.946
It's a gift.

46:13.993 --> 46:15.609
Should I open it now?

46:16.384 --> 46:17.782
What happened?

46:17.782 --> 46:19.344
Someone broke in.

46:19.344 --> 46:20.098
What?

46:20.123 --> 46:22.393
Yeah, I think it might
have been JH's killer.

46:22.418 --> 46:23.552
Why do you think that?

46:23.552 --> 46:26.692
Because I went by JH's house and school.
I think he followed me here.

46:26.717 --> 46:28.597
Well, that was stupid.
What were you thinking?

46:28.597 --> 46:30.431
I lifted some prints.

46:36.991 --> 46:38.024
OK.

46:38.291 --> 46:39.384
Wait, are you leaving?

46:39.384 --> 46:41.722
If this guy's coming after you,
we need to know who it is right now.

46:41.722 --> 46:44.486
You stay inside, lock the door,
call me if you need anything.

46:44.486 --> 46:46.129
I don't have your number.

46:46.274 --> 46:47.734
Yeah, you do.

47:23.007 --> 47:26.061
- Hey!
- I was wondering if you opened it.

47:26.101 --> 47:27.789
What? You're checking up on me?

47:27.789 --> 47:30.629
No, I was checking to see
if I wasted my money.

47:30.789 --> 47:32.765
But I'm also calling with some news.

47:32.765 --> 47:35.018
You got a hit on one of those prints.

47:36.987 --> 47:38.059
Chris?

47:38.277 --> 47:39.541
You're still there?

47:39.541 --> 47:41.476
- Yeah.
- Did you hear me?

47:41.476 --> 47:44.147
- We have a name on one of your prints.
- Let me guess...

47:44.147 --> 47:46.611
- Anthony Glass.
- Yeah.

47:46.636 --> 47:49.195
- But how did you know?
- I'll call you later.

47:49.732 --> 47:51.776
ALTHOUGH THE CITY HAS RULED AGAINST...

47:51.975 --> 47:54.406
What do you mean
they're not even gonna consider it?

47:54.431 --> 47:56.114
They've already ruled!

47:56.114 --> 47:59.869
They were disappointed that neither
of us disclosed that you were on drugs.

47:59.894 --> 48:01.799
It's a prescription!

48:02.032 --> 48:03.563
God!
God damn it!

48:03.563 --> 48:06.539
- This is ridiculous!
- Whatever the case...

48:06.539 --> 48:08.953
I'm not gonna be able
to have you back now.

48:08.953 --> 48:11.351
The guy broke into my apartment!

48:11.376 --> 48:15.215
Unnamed sources is code
for illegally obtained.

48:15.945 --> 48:17.095
I'm sorry.

48:18.331 --> 48:19.631
So am I.

49:09.062 --> 49:10.808
Let me guess.

49:11.811 --> 49:13.124
Damn it!

50:10.215 --> 50:11.628
Dustin?

50:11.717 --> 50:13.363
Hey!
I'm in here!

50:14.657 --> 50:16.660
- Hey.
- I thought you were gonna be late.

50:16.660 --> 50:18.663
I was but I wanted to
spend some time with you.

50:18.663 --> 50:20.235
My work will still
be there tomorrow.

50:20.235 --> 50:22.685
- Could we go catch a movie? - Yes.
- Sweet! - But...

50:22.685 --> 50:25.663
Go clear your dirty clothes first.
I need to do a load by tomorrow.

50:32.607 --> 50:34.018
Dustin...

50:34.245 --> 50:35.882
How many times
do I have to tell you?

50:35.882 --> 50:39.240
When you're at home alone,
you have to keep the doors locked.

50:45.919 --> 50:47.644
- There was a little fault...
- When did it start...?

50:47.644 --> 50:51.544
No, no, I wanna hear the boat story.

50:51.579 --> 50:52.593
Come on!

50:52.593 --> 50:56.264
So, my Dad,
he got this 21-foot...

50:56.735 --> 50:59.714
Speed-boat and it was named...

50:59.851 --> 51:03.089
"The Keel of Fortune", cos he bought it
from someone who had won it

51:03.089 --> 51:04.503
on "The Wheel of Fortune".

51:04.503 --> 51:08.051
- That's bad. That's not good.
- I didn't name it, so...

51:08.413 --> 51:12.472
Anyways, we'd go down
to the marina and...

51:12.553 --> 51:16.589
My Dad makes me the first mate.
I'm like seven years old, maybe eight.

51:16.589 --> 51:19.141
And we get to the dock...

51:19.141 --> 51:21.685
At the gas station,
the boat gas station...

51:21.685 --> 51:23.539
And I jump off...

51:24.384 --> 51:28.499
On to the dock and I'm gonna tie up
the boat with this rope...

51:28.499 --> 51:32.426
But the boat kind of went back out.
It didn't stop and I...

51:32.426 --> 51:36.146
was holding to the rope and it just
pulled me right back into the water.

51:36.171 --> 51:38.239
But I still didn't let go off the rope.

51:38.985 --> 51:41.164
I'm seven and
having seen "Jaws",

51:41.164 --> 51:44.042
I was convinced that the
ocean was just full of sharks.

51:44.042 --> 51:46.784
Waiting to eat any children
that fell in the water.

51:47.252 --> 51:48.665
Oh, man.

51:48.690 --> 51:49.700
Yeah...

51:49.882 --> 51:52.767
That was -
that was the end of my sailing days.

51:52.820 --> 51:53.522
Mhm.

51:53.522 --> 51:55.311
No more sailing career for me.

51:55.311 --> 51:57.866
- It's probably for the best.
- Yeah.

52:00.025 --> 52:02.190
So when did you know
you wanted to be a cop?

52:02.314 --> 52:03.776
I don't know, I...

52:05.179 --> 52:06.853
It was just always...

52:07.520 --> 52:09.000
Like a part of me.

52:09.025 --> 52:11.332
Helping people,
you know, I got that...

52:12.208 --> 52:13.925
I got that from my Dad.

52:17.852 --> 52:20.221
And after I got shot, I just...

52:23.415 --> 52:25.437
I felt like such a failure.

52:26.776 --> 52:29.544
Because the one purpose I had in life...

52:29.664 --> 52:31.413
It was just taken from me.

52:32.732 --> 52:34.295
And everyday...

52:34.295 --> 52:36.524
at work, I just ...
I hated it.

52:36.524 --> 52:39.429
I hated every single day
because every call,

52:39.454 --> 52:41.331
was just a reminder...

52:42.861 --> 52:45.204
that I could no longer help people.

52:48.082 --> 52:49.160
And the...

52:49.459 --> 52:52.719
And the funny thing is,
the irony here... is that...

52:53.017 --> 52:54.965
I was helping people.

52:55.689 --> 52:59.145
I was the first person helping people.

53:01.881 --> 53:03.422
And now that's...

53:03.513 --> 53:05.590
And that's been taken from me too.

53:05.876 --> 53:07.910
You can always try to get reinstated.

53:07.910 --> 53:08.948
No.

53:09.204 --> 53:10.469
I can't.

53:10.906 --> 53:12.502
Can't or won't?

53:14.210 --> 53:16.771
Look, in order for you to move on...

53:17.402 --> 53:21.411
To truly move on,
you gotta put the past to sleep.

53:21.632 --> 53:23.409
You gotta let it go.

53:26.835 --> 53:28.292
Tell me what happened.

53:34.215 --> 53:36.376
I went on a patrol with my Dad.

53:36.876 --> 53:38.756
The department had...

53:38.978 --> 53:40.630
This tradition of...

53:40.668 --> 53:42.504
kids riding with their parents,

53:42.529 --> 53:44.523
on a patrol, erm...

53:48.838 --> 53:49.960
We...

53:50.778 --> 53:52.447
We saw a robbery...

53:54.051 --> 53:55.405
And I...

53:59.910 --> 54:02.736
I chased the perp down the alley.

54:06.594 --> 54:07.695
Freeze!

54:15.020 --> 54:17.688
- Is this what's this is about?
- I just...

54:17.769 --> 54:21.057
Look, I was hungry, OK?
My mum hasn't been home in days.

54:21.255 --> 54:23.389
... you down to the station. You just...

54:25.347 --> 54:28.114
You don't have to do this.
Everything will be OK.

54:28.114 --> 54:29.240
You don't understand.

54:29.240 --> 54:30.962
Put the gun down.

54:30.962 --> 54:32.760
I'm coming in, Chris!

54:33.307 --> 54:35.054
Back off or I'll shoot!

54:35.683 --> 54:37.191
It's all right, kid...

54:37.402 --> 54:38.826
It's all right.

54:39.371 --> 54:43.078
- It ain't all right!
- Just put the gun down.

54:43.893 --> 54:44.945
No.

54:44.945 --> 54:48.250
Look...
I'll put my gun away first, OK?

54:48.308 --> 54:51.717
Let's figure out how we can
all go home happy here.

54:53.839 --> 54:56.340
You're in total control
of the situation, kid.

54:58.284 --> 55:00.125
You can have your life.

55:00.572 --> 55:03.261
Petty theft don't mean a thing.

55:03.261 --> 55:04.614
Chris, don't!

55:14.181 --> 55:15.864
My Dad died...

55:20.867 --> 55:23.680
because of a bag of chips.

55:25.878 --> 55:27.312
Everything...

55:29.407 --> 55:31.923
would have been all right
if I would have just...

55:32.105 --> 55:33.418
listened to him.

55:34.831 --> 55:36.892
Hey, hey...

55:38.928 --> 55:40.727
The kid did this.

55:41.025 --> 55:44.862
Whatever his reasons were,
he caused all of it, he stole the chips.

55:44.862 --> 55:47.151
He ran,
he swiped your gun...

55:47.151 --> 55:48.653
He shot you...

55:49.249 --> 55:52.379
Because I reached
for my weapon.

55:52.379 --> 55:54.704
No, because you assessed
the situation.

55:54.704 --> 55:57.036
You were doing what
you thought needed to be done.

55:57.077 --> 55:59.870
Well, that assessment killed my Dad.

56:01.327 --> 56:03.334
You can continue to beat
yourself up about it

56:03.334 --> 56:05.778
because you think you deserve
the self-flagellation...

56:05.982 --> 56:07.369
But you don't.

56:09.137 --> 56:10.917
You deserve to be happy.

56:11.429 --> 56:13.243
If you haven’t realized it yet...

56:13.235 --> 56:14.959
I wanna be a part of that.

56:15.064 --> 56:18.150
You know, when you smile
and when you laugh...

56:18.842 --> 56:21.831
Which doesn't happen very often
but when you do...

56:23.752 --> 56:26.010
Your whole face lights up.

56:28.899 --> 56:30.844
Drives me crazy.

57:55.511 --> 57:57.489
- Tim, wake up!
- Mhm.

57:57.567 --> 58:00.367
Wake up. You need to go.
I need you to go now.

58:01.080 --> 58:02.044
What?

58:02.044 --> 58:04.327
I need you to wake
up and go please.

58:04.405 --> 58:06.997
- I need you to leave.
- What are you talking about?

58:07.286 --> 58:09.611
Can you please get up and get out?

58:11.028 --> 58:13.090
I don't understand.
Did I do something wrong?

58:13.090 --> 58:16.070
No, look, I'm a hurry.
I have my physical therapy appointment

58:16.070 --> 58:17.766
and I don't want
the distraction.

58:22.320 --> 58:23.297
OK.

58:23.297 --> 58:24.655
Thank you.

58:31.934 --> 58:34.716
God!
What have you been doing?

58:34.741 --> 58:37.755
- Just some gymnastics...
- Chris...

58:37.801 --> 58:40.650
Look, I just... I've been on my feet
more than usual. It's no big deal.

58:40.650 --> 58:44.258
You need to find a way to keep
off your leg. You hear me?

58:44.415 --> 58:47.998
The more you aggravate your leg,
the longer it's gonna take to heal.

58:47.998 --> 58:49.418
- OK.
- Listen!

58:49.418 --> 58:51.645
I don't mean to scare
you with this...

58:51.645 --> 58:54.106
But you continue this
way with your leg...

58:54.151 --> 58:56.074
And you're gonna jeopardize it.

58:56.099 --> 58:58.117
That means amputation.

58:58.630 --> 59:01.861
You really need to take
a minute and think about this.

59:03.377 --> 59:04.463
OK.

59:40.509 --> 59:42.182
Here we go.

59:42.784 --> 59:45.800
Hopefully you'll find
the right owners for those.

59:53.487 --> 59:54.867
Chris!

59:54.967 --> 59:57.325
- Hi!
- Hey, Monty!

59:57.569 --> 59:59.545
You're a brave man
riding in this heat.

59:59.545 --> 01:00:01.499
Oh, it's nowhere near
this time in Tucson.

01:00:01.524 --> 01:00:03.818
Plus, I'm actually not part
of the problem, you know?

01:00:03.949 --> 01:00:06.910
- What brings you by?
- You were right about the janitor.

01:00:06.935 --> 01:00:09.859
I was able to get him to turn over
some of those stolen goods.

01:00:09.859 --> 01:00:12.953
- That's great.
- Yeah. Thank you for the tip.

01:00:12.953 --> 01:00:16.228
You're welcome.
I take it you heard about the parents?

01:00:16.542 --> 01:00:17.584
Yeah.

01:00:18.476 --> 01:00:20.860
I don't get how a parent...

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.897
Can take a hammer
to their own kid.

01:00:25.269 --> 01:00:29.843
Yeah, and that's something
I was never able to wrap my mind around.

01:00:30.174 --> 01:00:31.302
Wait...

01:00:31.855 --> 01:00:34.093
You don't think the parents did it?

01:00:34.877 --> 01:00:37.489
I don't know, I mean...

01:00:38.158 --> 01:00:40.691
It doesn't matter,
there's nothing I can do about it now.

01:00:41.141 --> 01:00:44.021
Well, if there's anything
that I can do to help...

01:00:44.064 --> 01:00:47.271
- Anything at all, please let me know.
- I will.

01:00:47.376 --> 01:00:50.297
- You take care of yourself, Monty.
- You too.

01:06:18.293 --> 01:06:19.958
The gate won't open
up which is fine.

01:06:19.958 --> 01:06:21.914
He's like, yeah, yeah, hop
the fence, hop the fence...

01:06:21.914 --> 01:06:24.131
So I'm hopping the fence,
I'm seeing triple,

01:06:24.131 --> 01:06:27.474
Five sheets, no end.
And And I think there's this...

01:06:27.474 --> 01:06:29.979
Hey, I tried calling you there.

01:06:30.146 --> 01:06:31.421
Yeah, I know.

01:06:33.867 --> 01:06:35.682
Can I talk yo you for a minute?

01:06:38.251 --> 01:06:39.741
Please?

01:06:46.457 --> 01:06:48.578
Look, there are things that
I wanted to say to you.

01:06:48.578 --> 01:06:51.198
I just didn't feel right
leaving them in a message.

01:06:52.169 --> 01:06:53.366
So, say 'em.

01:06:54.099 --> 01:06:55.858
- Here?
- Mhm.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.685
About this morning...

01:07:02.958 --> 01:07:04.703
I panicked.

01:07:06.352 --> 01:07:08.106
Last night was...

01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:09.764
Was incredible.

01:07:10.219 --> 01:07:12.568
And when I woke up,
I was scared.

01:07:14.108 --> 01:07:15.515
And...

01:07:15.582 --> 01:07:17.875
And I'm sorry.

01:07:18.353 --> 01:07:19.897
You're sorry?

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:21.790
I'm sorry.

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:26.181
And I need your help.

01:07:27.924 --> 01:07:30.241
Wait, did you say all those things
so I'd help you?

01:07:30.241 --> 01:07:32.477
Look, I think I know who the killer is.

01:07:32.477 --> 01:07:35.606
I went by the school and I ran into
JH's Home Room teacher.

01:07:35.694 --> 01:07:36.885
And he said to me...

01:07:36.885 --> 01:07:39.915
he couldn't understand how parents
could kill their kid with a hammer.

01:07:40.082 --> 01:07:41.434
He knew about the hammer.

01:07:41.434 --> 01:07:44.006
That information was never
released to the public.

01:07:44.006 --> 01:07:45.818
And I went back and I went
through every news article

01:07:45.818 --> 01:07:47.220
and not one of
them mentioned it.

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:49.322
They all say blood force trauma.

01:07:49.755 --> 01:07:52.481
He knew about the hammer.
It has to be him.

01:07:53.124 --> 01:07:55.017
OK, that's interesting.

01:07:55.862 --> 01:07:57.168
What else?

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.913
He's from Tucson.

01:07:58.938 --> 01:08:02.526
Is there any way that you could look into
him without the department finding out?

01:08:02.609 --> 01:08:04.903
- That's it?
- For now.

01:08:09.427 --> 01:08:10.677
OK.

01:08:10.943 --> 01:08:12.419
OK. What's his name?

01:09:38.118 --> 01:09:40.982
- Freeze!
- Whoa! Whoa! Chris, it's me!

01:09:41.006 --> 01:09:42.520
Jesus!

01:09:42.817 --> 01:09:44.394
What are you doing here?

01:09:45.153 --> 01:09:47.426
I thought you might want
the information that I got.

01:09:47.612 --> 01:09:49.166
I nearly shot your head off.

01:09:49.166 --> 01:09:51.807
Well, thank you for
showing a bit of restraint.

01:09:51.902 --> 01:09:53.430
Let’s get you out of here.

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:55.497
- What'd you find out?
- Here.

01:09:55.497 --> 01:09:57.769
- No, I have to check upstairs.
- We're leaving.

01:09:57.769 --> 01:09:59.376
He's not gonna be back til after school.

01:09:59.376 --> 01:10:01.522
Chris, if we get caught in
here, I'm off the Force

01:10:01.522 --> 01:10:03.209
and who knows what they're
gonna pin on you.

01:10:03.234 --> 01:10:04.656
Just tell me what you found.

01:10:04.656 --> 01:10:07.205
I will tell you when you
get back in the car...

01:10:07.205 --> 01:10:10.265
Which can happen now
or when you finish your search.

01:10:22.387 --> 01:10:24.354
Next time you decide
to break into a house,

01:10:24.354 --> 01:10:26.840
take your cellphone, please. That way
I won't have to break in after you.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.261
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
What did you find?

01:10:29.406 --> 01:10:31.473
His jacket is clean.

01:10:31.473 --> 01:10:34.468
You took me out of the house
to tell me that? Thank you.

01:10:34.493 --> 01:10:36.504
But I did ask for similar
cases involving teens

01:10:36.504 --> 01:10:38.813
where the cause of death
was blunt force trauma.

01:10:38.969 --> 01:10:40.140
And?

01:10:40.398 --> 01:10:44.031
OK, so, in the last ten years
there were 15 matches.

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:45.590
Six were attributed to gangs.

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:48.358
Eight others had convictions
and one other is still an open case.

01:10:48.383 --> 01:10:51.136
Well, did you get a list
of schools were those were at?

01:10:51.321 --> 01:10:52.278
Yeah.

01:10:52.816 --> 01:10:55.784
OK, let's cross-reference those
with the schools were Monty taught.

01:10:55.809 --> 01:10:57.790
I didn't get those.
You got them?

01:10:57.850 --> 01:10:59.529
No, erm...

01:10:59.704 --> 01:11:02.027
It's OK.
We'll use Linked-In.

01:11:03.304 --> 01:11:04.745
What's that?

01:11:15.142 --> 01:11:17.698
- OK. Are you ready?
-Yeah.

01:11:17.719 --> 01:11:19.153
Piedmont?

01:11:19.211 --> 01:11:20.211
No.

01:11:20.704 --> 01:11:22.871
- John Marshall.
- No.

01:11:22.871 --> 01:11:24.722
- Holy Cross?
- No.

01:11:24.725 --> 01:11:27.258
- Ben Franklin? - No.
- Saint Mary's.

01:11:27.433 --> 01:11:28.231
No.

01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:31.848
Damn it. It has to be him.
I can feel it.

01:11:32.231 --> 01:11:34.337
Look, let's go to the
school and question him.

01:11:34.337 --> 01:11:37.273
No, absolutely not.
We'll be patient and we wait.

01:11:37.273 --> 01:11:39.463
Wait? What are we gonna wait for?
For him to kill another kid?

01:11:39.463 --> 01:11:42.282
Just be patient. OK?

01:12:38.002 --> 01:12:41.659
Did you have a list of the activities
that the kids were involved in?

01:12:41.684 --> 01:12:43.437
You mean, a sports day plan?

01:12:43.437 --> 01:12:46.096
No, erm... programs.

01:12:46.096 --> 01:12:48.805
Monty volunteered
to the boys and girls club.

01:12:53.746 --> 01:12:56.024
No, I don't have anything like that.

01:12:58.552 --> 01:13:01.250
The unsolved murder,
what what the name of the Vic?

01:13:02.866 --> 01:13:06.128
His name was Joaquin Jackson.

01:13:14.314 --> 01:13:17.250
Son of a bitch.
Here, check out his obituary.

01:13:17.275 --> 01:13:20.143
In Joaquin's free time he enjoyed
playing basketball with his friends.

01:13:20.143 --> 01:13:23.603
En lieu of flowers, please make a donation
to his honor to the boys and girls club.

01:13:23.603 --> 01:13:26.475
- It's him. - OK, Chris.
- No, look. He knew about the hammer.

01:13:26.475 --> 01:13:29.860
And what better person to know the
details of a kid's life than his teacher?

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:33.377
And now... now we have him connected
to another unsolved murder.

01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:36.071
We have to get back in that house.

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:42.030
- OK. Yeah, we do.
- Yeah.

01:13:44.227 --> 01:13:45.398
Chris!

01:14:00.397 --> 01:14:01.991
Let's go back in there.

01:14:02.092 --> 01:14:03.987
- Let's go in.
- No, no.

01:14:04.043 --> 01:14:06.851
Here's the plan. I'm gonna go
in and look for that bandana.

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:09.851
You stay on him, give me a heads-up
if he's coming back to the house.

01:14:09.851 --> 01:14:11.489
- OK?
- OK?

01:17:10.775 --> 01:17:12.344
Oh. my God.

01:18:24.324 --> 01:18:25.735
Freeze!

01:19:17.828 --> 01:19:19.484
Come on, Tim.

01:19:19.509 --> 01:19:21.516
Answer, answer, answer.

01:19:42.298 --> 01:19:43.944
Damn it!

01:20:17.117 --> 01:20:18.525
No!

01:20:25.358 --> 01:20:26.626
Tim!

01:20:27.175 --> 01:20:29.178
- Are you OK?
- Attic.

01:20:53.269 --> 01:20:54.746
Damn it.

01:21:17.501 --> 01:21:18.895
No.

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:20.712
That would be mine.

01:21:23.567 --> 01:21:24.958
Drop it!

01:21:25.293 --> 01:21:27.700
I said... drop it!

01:21:29.157 --> 01:21:32.378
Put it on the ground... now!

01:21:44.239 --> 01:21:46.239
Chris, don't!

01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:49.182
Put the gun on the ground, Monty.

01:21:49.182 --> 01:21:51.498
- OK.
- Put it down!

01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:56.855
Putting it down.

01:22:03.113 --> 01:22:04.780
Hang in there.

01:22:06.471 --> 01:22:11.750
Shots fired. Officer down.
2302 Tinderbrook Lane.

01:22:13.038 --> 01:22:16.074
Just hang in there, OK?
You'll be OK.

01:22:17.184 --> 01:22:21.398
- You used your cellphone. - Yeah.
- I'm proud of you.

01:22:32.256 --> 01:22:35.339
OK. OK, we gotta get you
down to the station

01:22:35.339 --> 01:22:37.780
so we can get your
official statement.

01:22:38.151 --> 01:22:39.603
Can you walk?

01:22:40.698 --> 01:22:42.365
Probably shouldn't.

01:22:42.551 --> 01:22:45.016
I'll see if the MT's have a wheelchair.

01:22:45.298 --> 01:22:46.727
Did you find the stuff?

01:22:46.752 --> 01:22:49.347
- Did you find the stuff?
- Yeah, all of it. You got him.

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:52.155
Hey. Take these things off her, please.

01:22:52.155 --> 01:22:53.691
Tim and I did.

01:22:53.843 --> 01:22:55.843
I hope the Department
takes it easy on him.

01:22:55.868 --> 01:22:59.084
Oh, they don't want
the bad press of going after a cop

01:22:59.084 --> 01:23:02.163
who caught a serial killer,
a child serial killer.

01:23:02.483 --> 01:23:05.749
Chris, we just didn't see it.

01:23:06.402 --> 01:23:08.352
You would have, eventually.

01:23:08.564 --> 01:23:10.994
Yeah, but how many more victims
would there have been?

01:23:19.334 --> 01:23:21.142
You did good here.

01:23:23.909 --> 01:23:25.126
Hey...

01:23:26.291 --> 01:23:28.685
Your Dad would have been proud.
