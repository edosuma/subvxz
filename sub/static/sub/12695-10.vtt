the forecast says no snow

maybe there's enough here
for us to retire on

08:28.475 --> 08:30.611
so we can spend more
time with the kids!

to the suburbs

a normal childhood.

give Nora a good gift.

no gift at all.

ruin her Christmas.

everyone bad gifts.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.734
- That wasn't a dream.

Nora cottage cheese.

- [bombs whistling, exploding]

10:01.168 --> 10:03.003
- [tube whacks]
- Ow!

10:03.103 --> 10:06.406
- Wake up, Max!
It's Christmas morning!

10:06.506 --> 10:09.910
- What the Dickens
are you supposed to be?

10:10.010 --> 10:13.446
- I'm the Spirit
of Christmas "Present."

10:13.546 --> 10:15.816
Get it?

10:15.916 --> 10:16.984
- Got it.

10:17.084 --> 10:20.453
Let's "wrap" this up.
Get it?

10:20.553 --> 10:21.855
- Can't. You didn't
learn a thing

10:21.955 --> 10:23.190
from the Spirit
of Christmas Past.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.392
So, now I have to show
you Nora's reaction

10:25.492 --> 10:27.094
when she opens her gift
in the morning.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.629
- No thanks, barfbag.

10:29.730 --> 10:33.566
See, I did learn something.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.503
- [loud whack]
- Ow!

10:36.603 --> 10:39.106
Why's that wrapping paper
hurt so much?

10:39.206 --> 10:42.710
- Because it's a bat.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.978
- I'll get my shoes.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.916
- [sighs]
I love my job.

10:49.016 --> 10:52.619
- *

10:52.720 --> 10:56.489
- Man, I look good
in the morning.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.525
Here you go, Nora.
- Thanks, Max.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.360
- Oh, it's "nothing."

11:00.460 --> 11:02.462
[laughs]
And I'm funny, too.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.297
- Hey, what gives?

11:04.397 --> 11:05.866
- What's wrong, Nora?

11:05.966 --> 11:07.835
- There's nothing
inside, that's what.

11:07.935 --> 11:11.739
- That is messed up!

11:11.772 --> 11:13.774
- Un-Merry Christmas!

11:13.874 --> 11:16.744
- Maximus Octavius Thunderman,
how could you?

11:16.844 --> 11:18.611
- Apologize to your sister.

11:18.746 --> 11:21.614
- Only if you apologize
for my middle name.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.584
- BARB & HANK:
We're sorry.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.053
- Oh.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.756
Well, I'm still
not apologizing.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.423
- Don't worry, guys.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.192
It's gonna take
a lot more than

11:32.292 --> 11:34.627
one empty box to ruin
Christmas, right, Nora?

11:34.762 --> 11:37.430
- No snow? No present?

11:37.530 --> 11:41.168
Christmas is ruined!

11:41.268 --> 11:43.370
- Batter up!

11:43.470 --> 11:44.772
- Ow!

11:44.872 --> 11:46.539
- Hey, what's all
the hubbub?

11:46.639 --> 11:47.841
Another bad dream?

11:47.941 --> 11:51.044
- Yeah, but this one
finally opened my eyes.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.546
I think I learned a valuable
lesson about Christmas.

11:53.646 --> 11:57.951
- Don't drink your Dad's eggnog
because I bathe in it?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.519
- I've been a complete
fool, Colosso.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.054
What kind of
small-minded person

12:01.154 --> 12:03.323
tries to ruin
a little girl's Christmas?

12:03.423 --> 12:06.259
When he could ruin
everyone's Christmas!

12:09.662 --> 12:11.899
[cackling]
- COLOSSO: [cackling]

12:14.634 --> 12:16.536
- Oh, I'm a mean one.

12:16.636 --> 12:23.476
- *

12:23.576 --> 12:25.212
- COLOSSO: [cackling]

12:29.817 --> 12:31.084
I can't wait to wake up

12:31.184 --> 12:33.821
and see everyone's
disappointed faces.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.288
- Barb will be so upset,

12:35.388 --> 12:37.991
she won't see
the mistletoe comin'.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.527
Then it's nothin' but lips.

12:44.497 --> 12:48.836
- [recorded man cackling]

12:53.340 --> 12:54.741
- [whooshing]

12:54.842 --> 12:56.743
- [bed thudding]

12:56.844 --> 13:00.247
- Please don't be another
weird Phoebe.

13:00.347 --> 13:03.450
- I am the Spirit
of Christmas Future...

13:03.550 --> 13:08.255
where we have awesome haircuts
and giant candy.

13:08.355 --> 13:11.091
Max Thunderman, you stole
Christmas from your family.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.626
- That's right. What are you
gonna do about it?

13:13.726 --> 13:15.963
Ah, don't hit me!

13:16.063 --> 13:18.966
- Oh, that's right.
Christmas Present was here.

13:19.066 --> 13:22.269
She bats cleanup on our Spirit
softball team.

13:22.369 --> 13:25.638
Now, come on, let us go see how
things turned out in the future.

13:25.738 --> 13:28.108
- And get giant candy?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.576
- No.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.547
- [whooshing]

13:36.283 --> 13:41.721
- Whoa! I like it.
Evil chic.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.123
Black super-suits.

13:43.223 --> 13:46.726
Now that's a family I'm
proud to be a part of.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.128
Hey, where's Nora?

13:48.228 --> 13:51.498
- We'll get to that later.
But, first, behold!

13:51.598 --> 13:55.535
- BARB & HANK:
[cackling]

13:55.635 --> 13:56.937
- Are they cackling?

13:57.037 --> 13:58.705
Who taught them
how to cackle?

13:58.805 --> 14:00.207
- After you sank their
joy of Christmas,

14:00.307 --> 14:03.076
they turned to
a life of crime...

14:03.176 --> 14:06.379
and cackling.
- BARB & HANK: [cackling]

14:06.479 --> 14:08.949
- Oh, did you see how
fast those guards ran?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.417
- Oh, especially that old guy!

14:10.517 --> 14:13.720
Then again, you were shooting
lightning bolts at his butt.

14:13.820 --> 14:16.156
- BARB & HANK: [cackling]

14:16.256 --> 14:18.158
- Ohhhhh...
- I hate you so much.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.994
- I hate you more, baby.
[smooching]

14:21.094 --> 14:22.495
- Aside from the kissing,

14:22.595 --> 14:24.497
this is the greatest
day of my life.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.166
Future bump.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.768
- Bumping is no longer
a "thing."

14:28.936 --> 14:30.137
We mind text.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.505
I will send you
one now.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.007
[powers zapping]

14:34.107 --> 14:37.077
- Well, that's just rude.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.678
- It is now time to go see

14:38.778 --> 14:41.214
what became of your beautiful
sister, Phoebe.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.083
- Beautiful? [scoffs]

14:43.183 --> 14:45.085
I think you've
got the wrong Phoebe.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.287
Just a little joke.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.856
I'm having so much fun.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.960
- [whooshing]

14:53.026 --> 14:56.196
- Hiddenville High?

14:56.296 --> 14:59.967
It looks like I finally
turned this place around.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.536
- No, your sister did.

15:03.636 --> 15:07.407
It is now called Phoebe
Thunderman Academy of Fear

15:07.507 --> 15:09.776
and here comes its
wicked queen now.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.312
- [thunderous pounding]

15:12.412 --> 15:14.347
- MAX: Phoebe's bad, too?

15:14.447 --> 15:18.185
- So bad she rules this school
with an iron fist.

15:18.285 --> 15:21.854
- [iron fist clanking]
- [ground vibrating]

15:21.989 --> 15:24.257
- Oh, a real iron fist.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.727
- She got it from a diabolical
wood shop accident.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.997
- So lucky.

15:30.063 --> 15:33.100
- Hey, quarterback,
you're benched.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.402
- [loud thud]

15:35.502 --> 15:37.504
- [laughing]
Benched...

15:37.604 --> 15:40.907
'cause it's a bench.
[laughing]

15:41.008 --> 15:44.377
I'm gonna mind text
you--LOL.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.879
- Maybe it's time you see
what happened to Billy

15:47.014 --> 15:48.815
after his Christmas
was ruined.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.184
- Billy turned evil, too?

15:51.284 --> 15:53.520
I never wanna wake up.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.422
- [whooshing]

15:55.522 --> 15:57.890
- Oh!

15:58.025 --> 15:59.759
Why is Billy's picture
in my lair?

15:59.859 --> 16:01.328
- It's his lair now.

16:01.428 --> 16:04.264
The lair goes to the most evil
person in the family.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.033
- More evil than me?
[scoffs]

16:06.099 --> 16:07.300
Impossible.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.237
I replace seeing eye dogs
with blind ones.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.505
- Billy didn't get
any video games for Christmas.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.841
That left him with
14-16 hours a day

16:14.941 --> 16:17.710
to do nothing but get angry.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.580
- No, you listen to
me, Mrs. Claus.

16:20.680 --> 16:25.718
Put Santa on the phone
or the elves get it!

16:25.818 --> 16:29.289
- Whoa! Stealin'
the fat man's elves?

16:29.389 --> 16:31.824
Tsk, why didn't
I think of that?

16:31.924 --> 16:35.828
- You did not think of that
because you are his pet.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.497
- [Max's voice] Hey, Billy,
it's really funny

16:37.597 --> 16:40.200
what you're doin'
to those elves.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.736
Please feed me.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.072
- Sure, Max.

16:45.172 --> 16:50.743
How about
a shut-your-mouth sandwich?!

16:50.843 --> 16:52.212
- It is me.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.481
What kind of future
is this?

16:54.581 --> 16:56.749
And where are my pants?

16:56.849 --> 16:58.851
- He took them so you
would not run away.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.587
He needs you.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.223
He has nobody else
to hang out with.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.791
- Why?

17:04.891 --> 17:06.326
Where's Nora?

17:06.426 --> 17:08.895
- I was saving the most
important part for last.

17:08.995 --> 17:10.097
Hold on!

17:10.163 --> 17:12.165
- [whooshing]

17:12.265 --> 17:13.700
- Oh!

17:13.800 --> 17:17.170
Oh, what happened
to our old place?

17:17.270 --> 17:19.472
- This is where
Nora lives now.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.141
She had so many
great memories here,

17:21.241 --> 17:24.111
she came back to keep
the Christmas spirit alive.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.546
- Did she forget to pay our
heating bill in the future?

17:32.619 --> 17:34.554
- [powers zapping]

17:36.856 --> 17:39.259
That's okay.
We don't need a fire.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.928
We have each other
to keep warm.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.369
Get excited, everybody!

17:49.469 --> 17:53.240
This year's Christmas
bean is kidney!

17:53.340 --> 17:55.608
And be sure to save
room for dessert.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.145
We've got dumpster mints!

17:59.712 --> 18:02.882
- Why's she feeding
dumpster mints to dolls?

18:02.982 --> 18:04.751
- Nora refused to
become a villain,

18:04.851 --> 18:07.720
so your family kicked
her to the curb...

18:07.820 --> 18:11.358
right next to the dumpster
where she found those mints.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.892
- Oh, I almost forgot.

18:12.992 --> 18:16.429
I have something special
for you, Max.

18:16.529 --> 18:20.200
- Run, doll Max,
save yourself.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.169
- Merry Christmas.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.606
I forgive you for
stealing Christmas

18:26.706 --> 18:29.542
and splitting
up our family.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.211
- She forgives me?

18:31.311 --> 18:35.382
- I love you, Max.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.649
- [zooming]

18:36.749 --> 18:38.185
- NORA & MAX: Billy, no!

18:38.251 --> 18:40.287
- They cannot hear you.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.754
- Give it back.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.756
That's the only bow I have
left and it's for Max.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.092
- You should've turned evil
like the rest of us, Nora.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.660
- Never!
- Fine.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.764
FYI: If you're gonna eat
beans, open a window.

18:51.864 --> 18:56.068
Oh, that's right.
You can't afford windows.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.738
[zooming]
[cackling]

18:58.838 --> 19:00.440
- How can he do
that to her?

19:00.540 --> 19:02.542
- You did this to her.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.910
- No, I just...

19:04.010 --> 19:05.345
meant to ruin
one little day,

19:05.445 --> 19:06.679
not her whole life.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.481
I have to fix this.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.584
- Sorry, Max Thunderman,
it's too late.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.986
- [whooshing]
- No, no, it can't be.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.087
Take me back!

19:15.222 --> 19:16.823
Please, please,
I wanna change this.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.559
Don't go! Don't go!

19:19.659 --> 19:20.793
Don't go!

19:20.893 --> 19:23.230
Don't go! Don't go!

19:23.263 --> 19:27.934
- I'm starting to rethink
this whole roommate thing.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.135
- Colosso!

19:29.236 --> 19:30.970
[gasping]

19:31.070 --> 19:33.373
Am I me or am I
you in the future?

19:33.473 --> 19:36.976
- I'm the me who's gonna bite
you if you keep waking me up!

19:37.076 --> 19:38.678
- It is you!

19:38.778 --> 19:40.413
Come here, you big,
beautiful bunny!

19:40.513 --> 19:42.249
[smooching]

19:42.282 --> 19:46.453
- Huh, you're not Barb,
but I'll take what I can get.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.921
- It's 11:30.
It's still Christmas Eve.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.659
I have enough time
to save Christmas.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.362
- Call me!

19:55.462 --> 19:58.565
- [* "Deck the Halls" ]

19:58.665 --> 20:00.533
- Get down here,
sleepyheads.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.835
It's Christmas!

20:02.935 --> 20:06.239
- Why is Max
dressed like that?

20:06.339 --> 20:07.907
- I don't know.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.310
- Merry Christmas,
my beautiful family.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.578
[jingling sleigh bells]

20:11.678 --> 20:13.179
- Why is Max
acting like that?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.648
- I still don't know.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.218
- Guess who made
figgy pudding?

20:19.319 --> 20:20.387
Mmmmm!

20:20.487 --> 20:22.489
- Okay, everybody,
lock arms.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.091
Don't let go
no matter what.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.294
- What are you guys
waiting for?

20:27.394 --> 20:29.128
Let's open our gifts.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.467
- PHOEBE: Aw...
- HANK: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.270
- Oh, awesome.
- Beautiful.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.505
- A video game!

20:38.605 --> 20:42.409
I know what I'll be doing for
the next 14-16 hours.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.344
- HANK: [laughing]

20:44.444 --> 20:46.313
- Nora, this one
is from me.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.618
- Hey, what gives?

20:51.718 --> 20:53.520
- What's wrong, Nora?

20:53.620 --> 20:55.322
- There's nothing inside,
that's what.

20:55.422 --> 20:58.491
- Maximus Octavius Thunderman,
how could you?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.593
- Oh, wait,
there is something.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.495
- Never mind.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.868
- [reading]
"Look outside. Love Max."

21:08.968 --> 21:12.138
- HANK: Oh!
- BILLY: A white world!

21:12.238 --> 21:15.107
- A white Christmas?
I knew it would happen.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.977
This is the best
Christmas ever!

21:18.077 --> 21:20.347
- Max, how did
you do this?

21:20.413 --> 21:22.349
- Hello? Super genius.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.884
I built a machine to freeze
the world's water supply.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.520
But today, it'll make
snow for Nora.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.256
- I love you, Max.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.859
Can we go outside and chuck
snowballs at the neighbors?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.894
- Well, it wouldn't
be much of

21:34.994 --> 21:37.163
a Thunderman Christmas,
if we didn't.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.499
- Max?

21:39.599 --> 21:42.068
I'd like to think
all my pushing

21:42.168 --> 21:45.972
finally convinced you to embrace
the spirit of Christmas.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.140
- It's not so bad being
good once a year

21:48.240 --> 21:50.477
if it means Nora doesn't
have to eat dumpster mints.

21:50.577 --> 21:51.811
- What are you
talking about?

21:51.911 --> 21:56.749
- Like you don't
know, "Pheeba".

21:56.849 --> 21:59.719
- Wait for me!

21:59.819 --> 22:07.927
- [* "Jingle Bells" ]

22:11.764 --> 22:27.414
- *
