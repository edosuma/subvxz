WEBVTT

00:12.417 --> 00:14.083
Ma-Two, can I go
to Record City?

00:14.166 --> 00:17.125
What for? To buy some more
of that hippity-hop mess?

00:17.208 --> 00:18.834
They got this
new CD I want.

00:18.917 --> 00:20.417
Dinner's almost ready.

00:20.500 --> 00:21.750
And you're
spending
too much time

00:21.834 --> 00:23.125
listenin' to that
nonsense as it is.

00:23.208 --> 00:24.375
It ain't nonsense.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.333
And I already ate.
On my way home from school.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.417
Good, then you can
keep me company.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.625
I eat with you every day.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.208
That's a
blessing,
not a curse.

00:31.291 --> 00:33.166
My home cooking
and good company..

00:33.250 --> 00:35.250
Something to be envied.
Yeah, I know.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.166
If you want to go
somewhere,
why don't you go down

00:37.250 --> 00:40.000
to the church youth center
and try to make some
friends?

00:40.083 --> 00:41.917
Nobody ever says nothin'
to me there.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.750
Take them headphones off
and maybe they will next
time.

00:44.834 --> 00:47.291
'You gotta learn how
to speak up, baby.'

00:50.625 --> 00:52.250
You really not gonna
let me go?

00:56.583 --> 00:58.625
But we're talkin'
about my future, Ma-Two.

00:58.709 --> 01:01.417
If I start my own label,
I can get you a fat crib.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.041
Give you the kind of life
you deserve.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.750
Go set the table, Shemar.

01:10.375 --> 01:11.625
Mmm.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.250
Storage company called
this morning, Lil.

02:08.583 --> 02:10.709
Management got a complaint
about a foul odor.

02:10.792 --> 02:13.000
A strange leak
in one of the units.

02:14.792 --> 02:16.875
Freezer shorted.
Started leaking fluids.

02:16.959 --> 02:19.834
Unis found this inside.

02:19.917 --> 02:20.959
Ah.

02:23.417 --> 02:26.500
Shemar Reynolds. 12 years old.
Missing since August.

02:26.583 --> 02:28.458
Last seen on his way
home from school.

02:28.542 --> 02:31.667
Family's probably still
hoping
for a safe return.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.542
Don't they always.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.500
ID'd him pretty fast.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.041
Kid's earring helped.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.750
'We matched it
to Missing Persons.'

02:43.959 --> 02:45.709
Slashing his
face
wasn't enough?

02:45.792 --> 02:48.750
Took off his finger.
A souvenir, maybe?

02:48.834 --> 02:51.291
Takes a lot of rage
to do that to a kid.

02:52.917 --> 02:54.750
Doer soundproofed this place.

02:54.834 --> 02:56.750
- Muffled the noise.
- 'Lieutenant.'

02:58.166 --> 02:59.625
Tracking the name on the unit.

02:59.709 --> 03:01.750
Rented to a Theo Gamble.

03:14.625 --> 03:16.500
What is it?

03:16.583 --> 03:18.959
Three other storage units
in North Philly were rented

03:19.041 --> 03:21.250
under that same name.

03:58.792 --> 04:00.583
We got a serial killer.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.875
He killed four kids
that we know of.

04:36.959 --> 04:38.333
Victim number one.

04:38.417 --> 04:39.625
Damont Henderson.

04:39.709 --> 04:42.000
- Age 12.
- Last seen at Northland
Mall.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.417
October '99.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.792
Next, Kendrick Malone.
Nine years old.

04:46.875 --> 04:50.792
Left his house to meet
friends.
July 2001. Never seen again.

04:50.875 --> 04:53.125
Number three.
Marcus Hollister. 14.

04:53.208 --> 04:56.542
He went missing from his
block,
March 27, 2003.

04:56.625 --> 04:59.250
And Shemar Reynolds.
The most recent, 12 years old.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.041
Disappeared three months ago.

05:01.125 --> 05:04.500
And Missing Persons never
raised an eyebrow. Great.

05:04.583 --> 05:08.041
Cause of death, he slit their
throats. Slashed their faces.

05:08.125 --> 05:10.542
- 'Personal, doing that.'
- So maybe he knew them.

05:10.625 --> 05:13.166
All different ages,
different
parts of North Philly.

05:13.250 --> 05:14.959
Nothing in common.

05:15.041 --> 05:17.333
They all come from
tough neighborhoods.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.375
No way our guy just
waltzed in there.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.000
Had to be familiar.

05:21.083 --> 05:24.375
Took off their left
index
fingers. Postmortem.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.333
'Cause not just any finger
would do for this crackjob.

05:27.417 --> 05:30.000
The victims
sustained
shin splints

05:30.083 --> 05:32.208
abrasions under
their feet.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.625
They were alive.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.834
Their stomachs were empty.

05:35.917 --> 05:38.333
Initial stages of starvation.

05:38.417 --> 05:40.291
No signs of sexual assault.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.417
Meaning he didn't kill
them right away.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.417
So what was he doing
with them?

05:46.375 --> 05:49.083
We got a print off the lock
on the freezer in Shemar's
unit.

05:49.166 --> 05:50.583
I'm running it now.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.750
All the other units were
wiped clean. Every inch.

05:52.834 --> 05:55.166
The bodies, too.
Not one hair or fiber on 'em.

05:55.250 --> 05:59.208
Takes a lot of discipline,
care,
not leave a trace like that.

05:59.291 --> 06:01.166
What about the name
on the units?

06:01.250 --> 06:03.458
- Theo Gamble.
- Ran it through DMV.

06:03.542 --> 06:05.834
- Guy doesn't exist.
- 'Great.'

06:10.500 --> 06:11.959
Families are here.

06:12.041 --> 06:14.917
Lil, you and Scotty talk
to the storage managers.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.917
Yeah.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.625
The rest of us
talk to them?

06:18.709 --> 06:22.750
Before the media catches hold,
plasters it all over the news.

06:27.709 --> 06:29.333
Yeah.

06:29.417 --> 06:31.583
Waiting won't make
it
any easier.

06:44.542 --> 06:47.458
You and Damont were at the mall
when he went missing?

06:48.709 --> 06:51.625
He didn't wanna be seen
with his moms anymore.

06:51.709 --> 06:54.542
So he went off
on his own.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.500
Do you know
where exactly?

06:59.583 --> 07:03.458
I waited for him,
at the usual spot.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.792
Damont never showed.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.417
I spoke to detectives.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.625
Over the years.

07:12.709 --> 07:14.333
Didn't nobody
mention to me that

07:14.417 --> 07:17.333
there were other boys
missing. Why?

07:17.417 --> 07:19.959
They had to know that monster
was out there. Didn't they?

07:20.041 --> 07:22.583
(Stillman)
Says here your son Marcus
got caught up with a
gang.

07:22.667 --> 07:26.583
My son had his troubles,
but he wasn't no banger.

07:26.667 --> 07:27.917
The night he went
missing he told
you

07:28.000 --> 07:29.041
he was going
to the store?

07:29.125 --> 07:31.125
- Hmm.
- To get what?

07:31.208 --> 07:32.959
Popsicles.

07:33.041 --> 07:35.083
'Boys and Girls Club was
hosting a science fair.'

07:35.166 --> 07:38.208
Marcus needed sticks for
a bridge he was building.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.291
Could he have stopped
somewhere else?

07:41.375 --> 07:43.542
No. Marcus knew
I'd worry.

07:43.625 --> 07:46.208
And he was anxious
to get that bridge done.

07:46.291 --> 07:49.041
I asked this one cop about
putting out one of them, uh..

07:49.125 --> 07:50.375
...what'd ya call it?

07:50.458 --> 07:52.542
- Amber Alerts.
- Told me no.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.750
Said Marcus
probably ran away.

07:54.834 --> 07:56.333
Runaway, banger.

07:56.417 --> 07:59.667
All code for one thing.
We don't give a damn.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.667
'Mall security found
my son's jacket'

08:01.750 --> 08:03.250
near the food court.

08:04.458 --> 08:06.208
It's his favorite.

08:08.250 --> 08:11.333
Damont had that toy

08:11.417 --> 08:12.834
in his pocket.

08:14.333 --> 08:16.542
Someone give
it to him?

08:16.625 --> 08:18.667
I think he bought it.

08:18.750 --> 08:21.375
From one of
the toy
stores?

08:21.458 --> 08:23.000
I don't know.

08:24.792 --> 08:29.250
He was sweet on
this girl at school.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.917
His first crush.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.750
It was probably for her.

08:33.834 --> 08:35.917
Sounds like a nice kid.

08:38.166 --> 08:39.834
I told him..

08:39.917 --> 08:42.250
I told him he'd have plenty
of time to worry about girls

08:42.333 --> 08:44.291
when he got older.

08:44.375 --> 08:47.375
Some folks on the block
helped look for Marcus.

08:47.458 --> 08:50.291
Found this in a garbage can.

08:50.375 --> 08:51.959
Marcus had it
with him that
day?

08:52.041 --> 08:54.458
Yeah. Looks like
it's been picked through.

08:54.542 --> 08:58.375
'Nothin' much in it.
Just some magazines, tickets.'

08:58.458 --> 09:02.709
Kids get these at carnivals
or those kiddie pizza places.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.959
No carnivals
in our neighborhood.

09:05.041 --> 09:06.125
And Marcus would
never go anywhere

09:06.208 --> 09:07.458
like that without
tellin' me.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.458
'Shemar disappeared
three months ago!'

09:09.542 --> 09:11.458
And now you care.

09:11.542 --> 09:13.333
'Now you wanna ask me questions
about my grandson.'

09:13.417 --> 09:14.917
- Now that he's dead.
- The more information we
have--

09:15.000 --> 09:17.875
I came down to Missing Persons
every single day.

09:17.959 --> 09:20.291
And all I got was some nonsense
about how kids run off

09:20.375 --> 09:21.959
with their friends
to get high.

09:22.041 --> 09:23.875
"Oh, he'll come home"
they said.

09:23.959 --> 09:25.625
I'm sure that's what
they
believed at the time.

09:25.709 --> 09:28.083
If you people
had given a damn

09:28.166 --> 09:30.959
about just one of those
boys that disappeared

09:31.041 --> 09:32.583
my grandson would
still be alive.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.000
Now, wouldn't he?

09:41.792 --> 09:43.250
Yeah.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.166
Theo Gamble.

09:45.250 --> 09:49.041
Rented that unit in my
facility
starting back in '03.

09:49.125 --> 09:51.709
- Pretty memorable, this guy?
- Paid in cash.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.542
One year up front.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.667
That don't happen
every day.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.875
What'd he look like?

09:57.959 --> 10:01.000
He was black.
Mid-30s maybe.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.834
Look, I run the kind of place
where you don't pay

10:02.917 --> 10:04.583
too much mind.
You know what I mean?

10:04.667 --> 10:07.625
Was he a big guy?
Average size,
what?

10:07.709 --> 10:09.125
Anything'll help.

10:11.041 --> 10:13.583
All I remember is
he was kinda touched.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.250
As in crazy?

10:15.333 --> 10:17.500
He got all bent out
of shape over nothing.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.417
Aw, man.

10:21.542 --> 10:23.250
They always lose.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.041
It's a good thing
I don't gamble, huh?

10:32.875 --> 10:35.875
Alright, unit 3079.

10:37.250 --> 10:39.041
It's at the end.

10:39.125 --> 10:42.208
You, you promised me unit 1925.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.709
Both the same size.
Who cares about the damn
number?

10:44.792 --> 10:47.041
You promised me that number!

10:47.125 --> 10:50.125
1925.

11:00.959 --> 11:02.250
Take it. It's yours.

11:11.041 --> 11:13.750
And most folks want a unit
that's convenient.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.583
At the end of the row
or something.

11:15.667 --> 11:17.667
But he cared
about the number.

11:17.750 --> 11:20.041
You're damn right
he did.

11:20.125 --> 11:22.417
Like I said, touched.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.667
Look, we're gonna need
you
to talk with a sketch
artist.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.834
I told you I didn't
see nothin'.

11:26.917 --> 11:28.583
Except those ratty gloves.

11:28.667 --> 11:29.959
Rush.

11:32.709 --> 11:35.917
Got a hit on the
print
off Shemar's unit.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.875
- Whose is it?
- Akon Dupree.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.250
Multiple
assault
charges.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.458
Weapon of choice,
a knife.

11:43.917 --> 11:45.750
Get down now!
Get down now!

11:45.834 --> 11:47.959
Get on the ground!

11:48.041 --> 11:51.792
What the hell?
What the hell is this, man?

11:51.875 --> 11:53.917
There a reason for all
the fanfare, dawg?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.208
Four dead kids
reason enough?

11:55.291 --> 11:57.208
I don't know jack
about no dead kids.

11:57.291 --> 11:59.709
We found one in a storage
house not too far from
here.

11:59.792 --> 12:02.291
Heard it on the news. So what?
Ain't got nothin' to do with
me.

12:02.375 --> 12:04.291
I been in rehab.
You can ask 'em yourself.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.000
You might wanna explain
what your fingerprint's

12:06.083 --> 12:07.291
doing on that lock.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.625
What? Hold on.

12:08.709 --> 12:11.750
I went in there to steal
stuff.
That's it, alright?

12:11.834 --> 12:14.083
- Tell it to your lawyer.
- Oh, ease up, dawg.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.417
Maybe we could work out
a trade or somethin'.

12:17.709 --> 12:19.959
Oh, I don't think so, dawg.

12:20.041 --> 12:21.709
Listen, I got this
video camera.

12:21.792 --> 12:24.083
I lifted it from
the storage unit last week.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.750
And trust me

12:26.834 --> 12:29.000
there's somethin' on it
you gonna wanna see.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.500
(Rush)
'Explains the tape
on the floor.'

12:35.583 --> 12:37.792
(Valens)
'He's making the kid
stand there.'

12:39.500 --> 12:42.208
Check out the date stamp.

12:42.291 --> 12:45.458
August 27, 2007.

12:45.542 --> 12:47.500
Four days after
Shemar disappeared.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.750
Hmm.
Fast-forward
.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.542
(Valens)
'Made them stand there,
hours on end.'

12:57.625 --> 12:59.083
(Rush)
'Explains the shin splints.'

12:59.166 --> 13:00.500
The bruising.

13:00.583 --> 13:01.959
The same thing happened
to him as a kid?

13:02.041 --> 13:04.709
You know, he's...
reliving it maybe?

13:04.792 --> 13:07.000
Making others
go through the pain.

13:07.083 --> 13:10.000
(Valens)
'Sick bastard,
do that to some kid.'

13:10.083 --> 13:12.792
Made 'em stand until
they couldn't anymore.

13:13.583 --> 13:14.500
Wait.

13:14.583 --> 13:15.834
Take it back.

13:15.917 --> 13:18.375
Think the kid said something.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.917
[sobbing]
Defector Three.

13:23.458 --> 13:25.250
Defector Three.

13:26.625 --> 13:29.375
What the hell
is Defector Three?

13:29.458 --> 13:31.041
(Valens)
'Some kind of code?'

13:31.125 --> 13:32.333
(Rush)
'Kid hasn't eaten
in four days.'

13:32.417 --> 13:35.667
Could be rambling.
Nonsense.

13:37.792 --> 13:39.875
- Or a cry for help.
- To who?

13:39.959 --> 13:41.625
Only one who's gonna
see it is the doer.

13:41.709 --> 13:43.959
Nah, he's at the end
of his rope.

13:44.041 --> 13:45.375
He's desperate.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.875
- 'Yeah, so?'
- 'Nothin' to lose.'

13:47.959 --> 13:51.166
Hoping someone else gets
this tape besides the doer.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.208
Could be he's leaving
us a message.

13:57.333 --> 13:59.291
[quietly]
Defector three.

14:14.458 --> 14:16.709
Been up all
night
with Nick

14:16.792 --> 14:20.542
trying to figure out the
numbers
on the storage units.

14:20.625 --> 14:22.417
Why he's fixated on 'em.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.667
Tried military
code,
Morse Code.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.625
No luck.

14:27.709 --> 14:30.250
It can't be the killing
our doer's getting off on.

14:30.333 --> 14:31.792
Yeah? Why's that?

14:33.417 --> 14:34.917
Murder's not on the tape.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.583
It's not what excites him.

14:37.709 --> 14:39.250
The standing does.

14:42.041 --> 14:43.792
Akon's story
checked out.

14:43.875 --> 14:47.083
He was in rehab when two
of the victims
disappeared.

14:47.166 --> 14:48.667
Look at his eyes.

14:50.125 --> 14:51.458
He knows.

14:51.542 --> 14:54.208
- 'Knows what?'
- 'He's gonna die alone.'

14:58.625 --> 15:00.875
Loneliest thing
in the world, that.

15:02.333 --> 15:03.792
(Vera)
'Defector Three.'

15:03.875 --> 15:04.792
Figured it out.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.625
It's an arcade game.

15:06.709 --> 15:09.750
Oh. Why did Shemar leave
a message about some game?

15:09.834 --> 15:11.333
That's where he met his killer.

15:11.417 --> 15:14.333
Toys made exclusively for
those Funfair Grabber
games.

15:14.417 --> 15:16.500
Right. The game with
the big claw thing.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.875
- See 'em at carnivals.
- And arcades.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.458
Ditto with the tickets.

15:19.542 --> 15:22.542
There's an arcade on
Shemar's
route home from school.

15:22.625 --> 15:25.500
Also in the Northland Mall
where Damont disappeared.

15:25.583 --> 15:27.458
And two blocks from
Marcus's apartment.

15:27.542 --> 15:29.959
All of them had one of those
Defector Three games.

15:30.041 --> 15:31.166
Arcade.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.834
Perfect place
to troll for kids.

15:32.917 --> 15:35.583
Let's canvas 'em.
Station some unis there,
too.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.834
Someone might have
seen our doer.

15:43.208 --> 15:46.083
No suspicious dudes
getting past me.

15:46.166 --> 15:48.500
I got zero tolerance
when it comes to safety.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.166
- You take it seriously.
- Got to.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.250
This is the only place
where a kid from around here

15:52.333 --> 15:53.542
can be a kid.

15:53.625 --> 15:56.792
You remember seeing
Shemar Reynolds here?

15:56.875 --> 15:58.250
Few months back?

15:59.750 --> 16:00.875
Sure.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.208
High scorer.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.166
Always had an audience, too.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.500
- Any of 'em stand out?
- New kid.

16:07.709 --> 16:12.041
Fourteen, fifteen maybe.
Never seen him before.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.875
Watched your boy Shemar
like a hawk.

16:14.959 --> 16:16.083
Right over there.

16:16.166 --> 16:18.041
This kid and Shemar
exchange words?

16:18.125 --> 16:19.750
You could say that.

16:19.834 --> 16:22.542
He eventually got his nerve
up to play homeboy.

16:24.291 --> 16:26.208
(Shemar)
'Ah, don't try
that roundhouse kick!'

16:31.959 --> 16:34.417
- Yeah, boy!
- 'Ah!'

16:34.500 --> 16:35.500
'You got lucky.'

16:35.583 --> 16:36.875
Somebody had to
fall
in the pit.

16:36.959 --> 16:38.375
I'm just glad
it wasn't me.

16:38.458 --> 16:42.000
Uh, you talk now, but ain't
nobody ever beat me at home.

16:42.083 --> 16:46.417
Nobody, and I only
play the best.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.625
Chumps, all of 'em.

16:47.709 --> 16:49.667
Oh, well, let's see
how long you can stand.

16:55.792 --> 16:58.125
What's up?
Let's go.

16:58.208 --> 17:00.750
My grams gets all panicked
when I don't show on time.

17:00.834 --> 17:03.750
It's just a
few
blocks down.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.583
Uh, if you're scared

17:05.667 --> 17:07.166
just say so.

17:07.250 --> 17:08.500
You crazy?

17:08.583 --> 17:10.458
Five bucks says you're about
to get another whoopin'.

17:20.709 --> 17:22.500
This kid have a name?

17:24.041 --> 17:25.417
But they both
made the board.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.000
- The board? What's that?
- High score screen.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.291
Players' names get put on.

17:30.375 --> 17:31.500
The new kid..

17:32.375 --> 17:34.166
...he was number two.

17:39.166 --> 17:40.709
(Miller)
'Theseus.'

17:40.792 --> 17:43.792
Never saw Shemar
and that kid again after
that.

17:50.375 --> 17:52.166
Checked out all
the Defector Three games

17:52.250 --> 17:53.959
at the arcades our
victims
went missing from.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.959
Name Theseus shows up
on every one of them.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.166
All our victims
played him.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.542
Yeah, Kids were
pros at that
game.

17:58.625 --> 18:01.375
Nobody topped
their
scores for years.

18:01.458 --> 18:02.959
Storage unit was
rented by an adult

18:03.041 --> 18:04.333
so the kid
must be a lure.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.333
Gotta admit,
it's smart.

18:06.417 --> 18:08.500
Our doer using
a kid as bait.

18:08.583 --> 18:11.250
So what's the significance
of this game he plays?

18:11.333 --> 18:14.375
- Defector Three?
- It was a typical RPG.

18:14.458 --> 18:17.000
Players force their
opponents into the pit.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.583
- RPG?
- Uh, role-playing game.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.959
Toni's kid plays 'em.
Nothing special about this
one.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.500
Standard fight
to the death stuff.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.166
He's picking that
game for a reason.

18:25.250 --> 18:28.208
If it has a
significance,
I'm not seeing it.

18:28.291 --> 18:30.583
The moniker fits, though,
with the lure part, at
least.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.959
- Well, how so?
- Looked up the name Theseus.

18:33.041 --> 18:34.250
It's from Greek mythology.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.375
Theseus is a young man
who's sent by his father

18:36.458 --> 18:39.500
to do to bad guys
what they did to others.

18:39.583 --> 18:41.208
It's a father and son thing.

18:41.291 --> 18:44.166
Kid's doing his father's
bidding? Twisted.

18:44.250 --> 18:47.208
Well, some might believe
his dad's righting a
wrong.

18:47.291 --> 18:48.709
So the son finds a victim

18:48.792 --> 18:51.125
he convinces them to come
and play video games.

18:51.208 --> 18:53.917
Dad takes over from there.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.834
The name Theseus
showed up on a game

18:55.917 --> 18:57.166
in an arcade
in Brewery Town.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.542
There's another victim
out there?

18:58.625 --> 19:00.792
Nope. This opponent's
still alive.

19:00.875 --> 19:03.291
Corey Middleton, 11.

19:03.375 --> 19:06.542
Bring him in for a talk.
Maybe he can give us an ID.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.417
Any luck with those
storage numbers?

19:08.500 --> 19:09.750
Working on it.

19:11.625 --> 19:13.208
You know,
Toni's kid, Andre..

19:13.291 --> 19:15.750
...ain't much older
than these kids.

19:19.375 --> 19:22.291
I used to go to the arcade,
when I was little.

19:23.625 --> 19:26.959
You played against
someone named Theseus.

19:27.041 --> 19:30.542
You remember anything about
him?
What he looked like?

19:30.625 --> 19:32.083
He had a PlayStation.

19:32.166 --> 19:33.750
Wanted me to come over
and check it out.

19:33.834 --> 19:36.000
And did you, Corey?

19:36.083 --> 19:37.667
Did you go to his house?

19:39.458 --> 19:40.500
(Jeffries)
'You can tell the truth.'

19:40.583 --> 19:42.250
You won't get in trouble.

19:45.208 --> 19:46.792
Is Theseus the guy
that hurt those boys

19:46.875 --> 19:49.166
they're talking
about on TV?

19:49.250 --> 19:51.959
We don't know.
That's why we need your help.

19:53.917 --> 19:55.291
I just wanted
to play the game.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.083
After this, you
come to my spot.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.875
- Hit up my PlayStation.
- Which games you got?

20:02.959 --> 20:06.417
All of 'em, but the
dopest
stick to the basics.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.750
- Old school.
- 'Word.'

20:07.834 --> 20:09.250
Just like when we were
little kids, right?

20:09.333 --> 20:10.500
Look out! Look out!

20:10.583 --> 20:12.959
About time for
your
secret sidearm.

20:13.041 --> 20:14.125
How'd you know
about my move?

20:14.208 --> 20:17.750
Been watching you.
Long time.

20:17.834 --> 20:20.250
Watching me play?
For real?

20:20.333 --> 20:22.792
'Got to. I don't play
just anybody.'

20:22.875 --> 20:25.875
Only those who know
how to dominate.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.166
Wait till you see me
on the PlayStation.

20:31.291 --> 20:33.250
No, man! Come on.
Get up. Get up. Get up!

20:33.333 --> 20:34.500
No!

20:41.709 --> 20:43.667
I thought you
were
a winner, man.

20:43.750 --> 20:44.625
I usually am.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.625
Not today you
ain't.
You lost.

20:46.709 --> 20:48.709
You wasted my time.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.166
He got real mad.

21:05.250 --> 21:06.917
Are you sure the
kid
you were playing

21:07.000 --> 21:08.750
was wearing ripped gloves?

21:08.834 --> 21:12.083
Yeah. Like those ones
you use at baseball practice.

21:12.166 --> 21:16.041
Same gloves the guy at
the storage facility
described.

21:16.125 --> 21:17.500
The ones the doer was wearing.

21:17.583 --> 21:20.166
He was pretending, though.
That guy.

21:20.250 --> 21:22.000
What do you mean?
Pretending?

21:22.083 --> 21:25.291
He had gray hair
on his face. Like you.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.417
Gray hair?

21:31.583 --> 21:34.709
Our doer isn't
using
a kid as a lure.

21:34.792 --> 21:36.834
He's impersonating one.

21:43.917 --> 21:46.834
Got unis stationed at arcades,
malls, rec centers.

21:46.917 --> 21:48.208
Anyplace
with video games.

21:48.291 --> 21:49.667
Community knows we're
looking for a guy

21:49.750 --> 21:51.208
that passes himself
off as a kid.

21:51.291 --> 21:53.750
Meaning size ain't
one of his strong points.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.667
That's why he has to lure
'em
with the video games.

21:55.750 --> 21:57.542
I'll talk to
the families again.

21:57.625 --> 22:00.041
Ask them if a kid was
hanging around the victims.

22:00.125 --> 22:02.542
Hey, boss, these
families want answers.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.375
We keep coming back
with more questions.

22:04.458 --> 22:07.083
Well, we know Theseus
played video games as a
kid.

22:07.166 --> 22:09.917
Yeah, 'cause of that
"when we were little kids"
slip

22:10.000 --> 22:11.333
he made with Corey.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.083
Maybe Defector Three
was one of them.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.125
That game didn't
come out till '99.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.792
Gotta be a reason he chooses
kids who play that game.

22:17.875 --> 22:20.208
Not just any kids either.
Winners.

22:20.291 --> 22:22.458
It's all about domination
with this guy.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.375
Maybe he's putting them
in their place.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.000
Could be what those
storage units are about.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.458
(Valens)
'He's creating his own pit.'

22:29.542 --> 22:30.625
I figured it out.

22:30.709 --> 22:31.959
The numbers on the units.

22:32.041 --> 22:34.083
The numbers he rented,
insisted on.

22:34.166 --> 22:36.959
I'm thinking they had
to be some complicated code.

22:37.041 --> 22:39.917
It isn't.
It's simple arithmetic.

22:42.333 --> 22:45.083
- They all add up to 17.
- "Stick to the basics."

22:45.166 --> 22:46.792
Like he told Corey.

22:46.875 --> 22:49.208
He's latching onto these
names,
numbers and places

22:49.291 --> 22:51.291
like he's trying to
make
sense of something.

22:51.375 --> 22:53.709
What though? And what's
the significance of 17?

22:53.792 --> 22:55.959
(Valens)
'Theseus is all about
righting the wrongs.'

22:56.041 --> 22:58.625
Seventeen's probably
a place from his
past.

22:58.709 --> 22:59.959
Where things
went bad.

23:00.041 --> 23:03.333
Building, room number,
street address.

23:03.417 --> 23:04.959
Like I said..

23:05.041 --> 23:06.834
...nothing but questions.

23:06.917 --> 23:09.166
You're full of them now.

23:09.250 --> 23:11.750
Shame you wasn't around
when it might've helped.

23:15.041 --> 23:16.375
Ms. Johnson

23:16.458 --> 23:18.834
did Shemar make
any new friends

23:18.917 --> 23:20.125
before he disappeared?

23:20.208 --> 23:23.750
Come to his funeral
and you'll find out.

23:23.834 --> 23:25.375
We need your help
to stop this guy

23:25.458 --> 23:27.917
before he hurts
someone else's son.

23:31.417 --> 23:33.667
Shemar was shy.

23:33.750 --> 23:36.125
Kept to himself.

23:36.208 --> 23:38.583
Been like that
since his mama
left.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.000
No friends at all?

23:40.083 --> 23:42.834
Certainly none
that came around
here.

23:42.917 --> 23:44.709
What about at the arcade?

23:46.083 --> 23:47.333
Yeah, Shemar met a boy there

23:47.417 --> 23:49.166
a couple of weeks
before he
disappeared.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.500
A Theseus, maybe,
or Theo?

23:51.583 --> 23:54.959
Yeah, a
strange
sort of name.

23:55.041 --> 23:59.667
He put all kinds of
notions
in my grandson's head.

24:03.417 --> 24:05.208
Forgetting something?

24:16.625 --> 24:18.709
Ma-Two, can I ask
you a question?

24:18.792 --> 24:19.917
Of course, baby.

24:21.959 --> 24:23.500
What would happen to me
if you died?

24:26.458 --> 24:28.375
You listening to one
of those
hippity-dippity

24:28.458 --> 24:30.208
shoot-'em-up songs again?

24:30.291 --> 24:33.041
I told you all that
violence
and murder ain't good.

24:33.125 --> 24:35.834
- This song ain't like
that.
- Yeah, sure, it ain't.

24:35.917 --> 24:38.083
It's about the stuff
you talk about.

24:38.166 --> 24:39.375
Like hope..

24:39.458 --> 24:40.917
...survival.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.375
You'd like it.

24:43.458 --> 24:45.208
Thinking about your mom?

24:46.500 --> 24:47.750
Nah.

24:47.834 --> 24:49.208
You miss her, don't ya?

24:49.291 --> 24:52.000
I was only three
when she left.

24:52.083 --> 24:55.041
The only one I remember
being there is you.

24:55.125 --> 24:57.166
So why the long face?

24:58.667 --> 25:00.875
This kid I met at
the arcade said

25:00.959 --> 25:03.875
that boys with no family like
him get sent to this hard
place

25:03.959 --> 25:06.208
that they never
get out of ever.

25:06.291 --> 25:08.750
Theseus called it
"The Pit."

25:08.834 --> 25:12.375
And if you die then I'm
gonna have to go there, too.

25:12.458 --> 25:14.250
Shemar, baby..

25:14.333 --> 25:16.250
I ain't going nowhere.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.583
But what if you did?

25:21.166 --> 25:23.250
Your mama left,
don't mean I
will.

25:24.583 --> 25:27.875
I will always be
here
to protect you.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.000
I promise.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.750
Let's say our prayers.

25:39.709 --> 25:42.250
Theseus didn't
have a family?

25:42.333 --> 25:45.000
Shemar said he
didn't
have nobody.

25:46.834 --> 25:49.500
I didn't keep my
promise
to him, now, did I?

25:51.709 --> 25:55.291
You went to the police
every day, asking about Shemar.

25:55.375 --> 25:57.291
You tried.

25:57.375 --> 25:59.375
Shemar started
calling me "mama"

25:59.458 --> 26:01.792
after my
daughter
Belinda left.

26:01.875 --> 26:03.208
You were all he had.

26:03.291 --> 26:05.792
They say,
"It takes a
village."

26:05.875 --> 26:09.625
But Belinda was always
gonna be Shemar's mama.

26:09.709 --> 26:11.125
I never wanted to
take that from
her.

26:11.208 --> 26:13.458
I was just
second in
line.

26:13.542 --> 26:15.458
That's why he calls
you "Ma-Two."

26:17.625 --> 26:19.959
Thank you for your time,
Ms. Johnson.

26:20.041 --> 26:22.041
Find him.

26:22.125 --> 26:25.083
The man that did
this
to those babies.

26:26.125 --> 26:28.083
Make him pay.

26:28.166 --> 26:29.750
You hear?

26:32.667 --> 26:35.000
Theseus warned Shemar
about losing family

26:35.083 --> 26:36.375
'cause he
didn't
have one.

26:36.458 --> 26:37.875
Could've come
from an orphanage

26:37.959 --> 26:39.417
foster home,
juvenile facility.

26:39.500 --> 26:40.750
A lot of foster
care
facilities

26:40.834 --> 26:42.834
were breeding grounds
for delinquents.

26:42.917 --> 26:45.250
But there was one in
North Philly notoriously
bad.

26:45.333 --> 26:47.458
It was called Prichard
House,
but the residents

26:47.542 --> 26:48.959
had a
different
name for it.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.250
The Pit.

26:50.333 --> 26:52.625
Now, that's why
Defector Three.

26:52.709 --> 26:54.166
He was stuck
in "The Pit"
once.

26:54.250 --> 26:57.500
Now, he's killing kids who
were
able to put him there again.

26:57.583 --> 26:58.834
Gets better.

26:58.917 --> 27:00.458
Prichard got written up
for everything

27:00.542 --> 27:03.000
from professional misconduct
to health hazards.

27:03.083 --> 27:05.583
But in '86,
six kids were treated

27:05.667 --> 27:08.750
repeatedly for posterior
tibial syndrome.

27:08.834 --> 27:11.834
Also known as shin splints.

27:11.917 --> 27:14.250
The same injuries
as our victims.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.709
Patients were treated
by a Dr. Ben Breslyn.

27:16.792 --> 27:20.542
- Is he still practicing?
- At a clinic in Chestnut
Hill.

27:22.917 --> 27:24.834
The Pit, yes.

27:24.917 --> 27:26.208
I treated the kids there

27:26.291 --> 27:28.291
and at seven other
facilities around the
city.

27:28.375 --> 27:31.208
Back in '86, six kids came in
with these foot injuries

27:31.291 --> 27:34.166
bruising, uh,
shin splints.

27:34.250 --> 27:36.208
Detective, that was
over 20 years ago.

27:36.291 --> 27:38.959
You don't really expect
me
to remember it, do you?

27:39.041 --> 27:41.792
Six kids? 12 visits in two
weeks
with the same injuries?

27:41.875 --> 27:43.208
- Yeah, I do.
- Look..

27:43.291 --> 27:44.834
I was fresh out
of medical
school

27:44.917 --> 27:46.375
and hell-bent on
making a
difference.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.583
Then it would seem like
the kind of thing you'd
notice.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.125
You're trained not to.

27:50.208 --> 27:52.083
Just get them in and out
as quickly as possible.

27:52.166 --> 27:53.917
- And I'd been warned.
- About what?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.709
They told us these kids
would
do anything for attention.

27:56.792 --> 27:58.291
So you thought
they were faking it?

27:58.375 --> 28:00.834
[sighs]
No one wanted them
and they knew it.

28:00.917 --> 28:02.083
They didn't have
anything to lose

28:02.166 --> 28:03.792
by telling a
few
tall tales.

28:03.875 --> 28:05.583
Still, you didn't think
it was fishy?

28:05.667 --> 28:08.208
I might have if I had
more
than five minutes with
them.

28:08.291 --> 28:09.625
So you were too busy.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.083
There was one kid.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.166
Couldn't have been more
than nine or ten

28:15.250 --> 28:17.166
but that look in his eye.

28:17.250 --> 28:19.250
It always stuck with me.

28:20.834 --> 28:22.583
(Breslyn)
'How'd this happen, Malik?'

28:28.333 --> 28:32.417
A lot of you boys coming in
with these same injuries.

28:32.500 --> 28:35.083
You guys goofin' around
jumping off the stairs?

28:40.917 --> 28:42.458
Don't wanna tell me?

28:42.542 --> 28:43.583
Fine.

28:49.417 --> 28:50.917
Give this to your counselor.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.500
It'll help the pain.

28:54.041 --> 28:56.542
He made us stand
in the square.

28:56.625 --> 28:59.417
- Like that.
- Who?

28:59.500 --> 29:02.291
- Mr. Grimes.
- 'Grimes, the counselor?'

29:02.375 --> 29:05.750
Must've been standing there
an awfully long time.

29:07.083 --> 29:09.000
A few days.

29:14.917 --> 29:16.834
Days?

29:16.917 --> 29:18.750
He says when one of us
does something bad

29:18.834 --> 29:20.375
we all gotta
pay the price.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.959
Send the next kid in, alright?

29:32.583 --> 29:35.083
Don't forget to give that
prescription to your
counselor.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.583
So Grimes was the counselor

29:56.667 --> 29:58.417
to all the boys
with those injuries?

29:58.500 --> 29:59.792
Yes, night counselor.

29:59.875 --> 30:01.542
Former resident, too.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.792
A lot of them came
back to work there.

30:03.875 --> 30:06.750
- Any idea where he is now?
- He left in '91.

30:06.834 --> 30:10.375
Bounced around to a few
other
facilities till about '99.

30:10.458 --> 30:11.542
That's the last
I heard of him.

30:11.625 --> 30:13.417
'99, that's when
the killing started.

30:15.291 --> 30:17.625
I'm sorry I didn't do more.

30:17.709 --> 30:20.166
- Thanks for your time.
- Sure.

30:22.625 --> 30:24.208
Yeah, boss, what is it?

30:32.583 --> 30:33.750
My brother was standing
right here

30:33.834 --> 30:35.667
the whole time,
and now he's gone.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.083
Go call your sergeant.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.333
Tyrell Hobbs,
11 years old.

30:43.417 --> 30:45.125
Sister went around
the corner to use the
ATM.

30:45.208 --> 30:47.166
When she came back,
Tyrell was gone.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.458
How'd the hell
did this happen?

30:48.542 --> 30:49.917
We got all the arcades,
everything covered.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.792
Why is he snatching kids
from a pizza joint?

30:51.875 --> 30:53.792
Because we missed
one, Scotty.

31:11.458 --> 31:12.750
He knows we're onto him.

31:12.834 --> 31:14.875
Must've seen the unis when
he was trolling the arcades.

31:14.959 --> 31:16.417
So he finds the one
game
we weren't watching.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.458
- Luck of the devil.
- He knows time's running out.

31:18.542 --> 31:19.834
Probably got a
mission
to complete.

31:19.917 --> 31:22.000
- And he's succeeding.
- Maybe not, boss.

31:22.083 --> 31:23.458
We got a hit
on a storage unit

31:23.542 --> 31:25.875
near the pizzeria where
Tyrell went missing.

31:25.959 --> 31:27.542
Unit numbers add
up to 17.

31:27.625 --> 31:30.542
Guy with ripped gloves paid
cash
upfront a few days ago.

31:30.625 --> 31:32.500
Didn't go by
Theo Gamble.

31:32.583 --> 31:33.792
Fits the
description
of our doer.

31:33.875 --> 31:35.208
We gotta get down
there pronto.

31:35.291 --> 31:36.458
Shemar held on for days.

31:36.542 --> 31:37.667
Tyrell may not
have that long.

31:37.750 --> 31:38.792
(Jeffries)
'We got the counselor.'

31:38.875 --> 31:40.125
He's in Interview.

31:41.250 --> 31:42.583
No way you're
pinning the
murders

31:42.667 --> 31:44.834
of those North
Philly
boys on me.

31:45.709 --> 31:47.542
You had a nice long run.

31:47.625 --> 31:49.500
Eight years.

31:49.583 --> 31:51.959
Doesn't take a genius
to beat a murder rap

31:52.041 --> 31:54.125
'if cops aren't looking.'

31:57.417 --> 31:59.000
Oh, you think it's funny?

31:59.083 --> 32:01.667
Little boys with their
faces sliced open.

32:01.750 --> 32:05.709
You cops act all concerned
now
that you got some bad press.

32:05.792 --> 32:07.667
Need to lock somebody
up quick.

32:07.750 --> 32:10.250
- And any ol' brother will
do.
- The jig is up, Grimes.

32:10.333 --> 32:13.417
You got nothing connecting me
to
those murders and you know it.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.792
We found your storage unit.

32:15.875 --> 32:17.959
We need to open up unit 359 now.

32:18.041 --> 32:20.417
I don't know nothing
about no storage unit.

32:20.500 --> 32:22.750
What about The Pit?

32:22.834 --> 32:24.291
You should know
a lot about that.

32:24.375 --> 32:25.667
The foster care home?

32:25.750 --> 32:27.542
That place shut down in '95.

32:27.625 --> 32:31.125
That's where you first tried
out your techniques.

32:31.208 --> 32:34.542
Making kids stand for hours on
end till they couldn't anymore.

32:34.625 --> 32:37.166
Maybe I used some
tactics
that weren't popular.

32:37.250 --> 32:38.709
Popular?

32:38.792 --> 32:40.583
That's an understatement,
Grimes.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.750
There was 34 of those
Billy Badasses

32:42.834 --> 32:44.333
and only one of me.

32:44.417 --> 32:46.291
I did what I had
to keep them in line.

32:46.375 --> 32:48.375
You hated those boys,
didn't you?

32:49.500 --> 32:51.709
(Rush)
'Taught 'em all a lesson.'

32:51.792 --> 32:53.291
(Grimes)
'I didn't hate 'em.'

32:53.375 --> 32:55.125
'I disciplined them.'

32:55.208 --> 32:57.208
Your brand of discipline
was torture.

32:57.291 --> 32:59.750
(Valens)
'We talked to Dr. Breslyn.'

32:59.834 --> 33:01.834
He didn't leave me a choice.

33:01.917 --> 33:03.542
- Who?
- Malik.

33:03.625 --> 33:05.875
I was at my wit's end with him.

33:05.959 --> 33:08.208
(Rush)
'He was your first.'

33:08.291 --> 33:11.083
I made him stand
in the square.

33:12.417 --> 33:14.709
(Grimes)
'The others, too.'

33:14.792 --> 33:17.458
But the runt
just wouldn't learn.

33:38.792 --> 33:42.000
You gotta be real tired
of standing here, huh, Malik?

33:48.875 --> 33:50.083
If you
learned
to sit still

33:50.166 --> 33:52.750
you wouldn't be
breaking
things all the time.

33:52.834 --> 33:55.250
I told you what I'd do
if it happened again.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.417
Didn't I?

33:57.500 --> 34:00.792
Now all the boys in your
ward have to suffer.

34:00.875 --> 34:02.750
Because when one person
does something wrong

34:02.834 --> 34:04.250
we all gotta pay!

34:06.000 --> 34:07.417
Not you.

34:09.041 --> 34:10.834
Was I talking to you?

34:14.875 --> 34:16.959
'Was I talkin' to you?'

34:20.125 --> 34:22.291
Now, if you boys want
this to be your last night

34:22.375 --> 34:24.750
of standing here like this..

34:26.375 --> 34:29.041
...you need to make sure
Malik learns his lesson.

34:32.208 --> 34:33.291
Clear?

34:42.417 --> 34:43.917
Malik learned.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.458
He didn't get
in trouble
again.

34:48.542 --> 34:50.125
What did they
do to him?

34:52.166 --> 34:54.166
What did they
do to Malik?

34:55.417 --> 34:57.333
They cut off his finger.

35:01.041 --> 35:03.208
The boys in
that bathroom

35:03.291 --> 35:05.834
were different ages,
just like our victims.

35:05.917 --> 35:08.125
How many boys were
in there with Malik?

35:08.208 --> 35:09.709
Five.

35:09.792 --> 35:11.500
Tyrell's the fifth victim.

35:11.583 --> 35:13.250
It's endgame.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.542
What was the room number
on that bathroom?

35:15.625 --> 35:18.291
- How you know it had a number?
- What was the number?

35:59.792 --> 36:01.959
Don't come near me. Hmm?

36:03.125 --> 36:05.458
Drop the guns...now.

36:05.542 --> 36:07.709
(Valens)
Only if you let Tyrell go.

36:11.208 --> 36:12.667
I know why you're here, Malik.

36:12.750 --> 36:15.917
(Rush)
'What happened,
in this room to you..'

36:16.000 --> 36:17.875
I know.

36:17.959 --> 36:20.625
You got no idea
about this room.

36:21.667 --> 36:24.542
- About me.
- 'Right.'

36:24.625 --> 36:26.000
(Valens)
'You're just some psycho'

36:26.083 --> 36:27.375
on a power trip.

36:27.458 --> 36:29.583
You ain't better than that.

36:29.667 --> 36:33.500
- Oh, you think you know?
- 'A loser.'

36:33.583 --> 36:35.208
Who takes it out
on little kids.

36:35.291 --> 36:37.208
Big man like you.

36:37.291 --> 36:39.500
- I am not--
- No.

36:39.583 --> 36:41.917
Now you
call
the shots.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.750
(Rush)
'You searched for
those five boys.'

36:44.834 --> 36:46.000
'All winners.'

36:46.083 --> 36:50.250
Who demeaned you
for months, years.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.166
Before, you were
powerless to stop them..

36:53.250 --> 36:54.458
...not now.

36:54.542 --> 36:55.709
'Not ever again.'

36:55.792 --> 36:59.375
Everybody stood
in the square, huh..

36:59.458 --> 37:04.250
- ...because I said so.
- Because you're Theseus.

37:04.333 --> 37:07.792
Righting the wrongs
of things done to you in
here.

37:09.375 --> 37:11.458
I was the smallest

37:11.542 --> 37:14.250
the weakest, but
they didn't care.

37:15.709 --> 37:17.917
They took everything from you.

37:20.417 --> 37:21.500
And now..

37:22.667 --> 37:25.083
...I take everything..

37:27.250 --> 37:28.959
...from them.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.709
Now, if you boys want this
to be the last night

37:34.792 --> 37:36.959
of standing here like this..

37:38.583 --> 37:41.583
...you need to make sure
Malik learns his lesson.

37:44.542 --> 37:45.583
Clear?

37:55.125 --> 37:57.333
<i>(Malik)</i>
<i>They were laughing.</i>

37:57.417 --> 38:01.792
<i>Yet Theseus knew</i>
<i>his day would come.</i>

38:01.875 --> 38:05.458
<i>That fed him. It was</i>
<i>his source of strength.</i>

38:05.542 --> 38:08.709
<i>It gave purpose</i>
<i>to his miserable life.</i>

38:08.792 --> 38:12.792
<i>Made him invincible.</i>
<i>Immortal.</i>

38:12.875 --> 38:13.917
<i>God.</i>

38:15.375 --> 38:19.458
<i>He found them,</i>
<i>one by one.</i>

38:20.959 --> 38:25.166
<i>And he did exactly what</i>
<i>they had done to him.</i>

38:36.750 --> 38:40.208
- Those boys wronged you.
- They have to pay.

38:40.291 --> 38:41.583
(Rush)
'Cause you kill the strong.'

38:41.667 --> 38:44.625
The ones that tormented you.

38:44.709 --> 38:48.208
- In this room.
- Don't come near me!

38:53.333 --> 38:56.542
You're the strong one,
not him.

38:58.166 --> 38:59.375
Look.

38:59.458 --> 39:01.166
Look, Malik.

39:07.834 --> 39:10.625
'Tyrell is just a boy.'

39:10.709 --> 39:12.542
Like you were.

39:21.500 --> 39:22.417
You hear that?

39:22.500 --> 39:24.000
'It's over.'

39:25.125 --> 39:27.583
Put the knife down, Malik.

39:30.959 --> 39:32.667
Do you know what happened
to Theseus in the end?

39:32.750 --> 39:35.166
Malik...don't!

39:35.250 --> 39:38.667
He rose out of the pit..

39:38.750 --> 39:40.291
...a hero.

39:40.375 --> 39:43.000
He did what no else could

39:43.083 --> 39:46.959
and they cheered him on.

39:47.041 --> 39:48.750
Welcomed him..

39:51.208 --> 39:53.083
...home.

39:53.166 --> 39:54.959
Put it down.

39:58.250 --> 39:59.625
It's not over.

43:02.417 --> 43:03.750
