(Playing classical music)

00:04.105 --> 00:05.275
(Indistinct conversations)

00:05.276 --> 00:07.107
Hey. Thank you for coming.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.608
Melissa's so excited.

00:08.609 --> 00:11.111
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

00:11.112 --> 00:13.443
(Music continues)

00:13.444 --> 00:16.386
(Woman) Aah!

00:16.387 --> 00:17.687
(Woman) Oh, my...

00:17.688 --> 00:19.689
(Man) Oh, my god.

00:19.690 --> 00:23.254
(Guests screaming)

00:36.707 --> 00:38.338
Mom, am I fat?

00:38.339 --> 00:41.772
No. You are not fat.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.545
I think I need a nose job.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.077
Excuse me?

00:47.078 --> 00:48.378
Do you see the tip? They
can fix that, you know?

00:48.379 --> 00:49.819
Chloe Kane had hers done.

00:49.820 --> 00:52.051
At 13? A nose job?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.823
Yeah, it'll look great.
Lacey, you're still growing.

00:53.824 --> 00:55.185
Besides, you're
perfect the way you are.

00:55.186 --> 00:56.486
Just give it some time.

00:56.487 --> 00:58.258
That's what every parent says.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.130
Well, in this case, it's
true. You know what?

01:00.131 --> 01:02.162
I feel all better
now. Thank you.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.194
(Doorbell rings)

01:04.195 --> 01:06.197
Gotta go. That's
Cassie. Bye, mom.

01:11.742 --> 01:14.274
(Cell phone rings)

01:14.275 --> 01:15.445
(Sighs)

01:15.446 --> 01:16.606
(Beeps)

01:16.607 --> 01:18.348
Megan hunt.

01:18.349 --> 01:20.251
I'll be right there.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.785
(Indistinct conversations)

01:25.786 --> 01:28.789
(Police radio chatter)

01:30.321 --> 01:31.861
(Camera shutter clicking)

01:31.862 --> 01:34.194
Okay, so tell me
exactly what happened.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.126
I was in my room getting ready,

01:36.127 --> 01:37.527
and then I heard the scream.

01:37.528 --> 01:39.199
And then what happened?

01:39.200 --> 01:41.701
I came running.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.174
You're the father of the bride?

01:44.175 --> 01:45.335
Yes.

01:45.336 --> 01:48.508
Where were you when
Melissa fell off the balcony?

01:48.509 --> 01:50.210
We were... we were
heading downstairs

01:50.211 --> 01:52.111
to join the rest of
the wedding party.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.214
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

01:54.215 --> 01:55.186
(Camera shutter clicks)

01:55.187 --> 01:56.346
Afternoon, Peter.
What have we got?

01:56.347 --> 01:57.517
Bride-to-be took a
header off the balcony.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.219
Could be a suicide.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.692
I hate weddings.

02:07.228 --> 02:10.230
(Indistinct conversations)

02:10.231 --> 02:11.731
(Megan) Nice dress.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.304
(Morris) Not a sight I
ever expected to see.

02:14.305 --> 02:15.635
Who is she?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.167
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

02:17.168 --> 02:19.769
Melissa waxman,
26, schoolteacher.

02:19.770 --> 02:22.242
She came down
a little before 2:00.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.474
Looks like multiple
traumatic injuries

02:24.475 --> 02:27.277
consistent with
a high-level fall,

02:27.278 --> 02:30.920
including massive
closed head trauma.

02:30.921 --> 02:32.582
She's got a compound
fracture to her left leg.

02:32.583 --> 02:34.254
(Camera shutter clicks)

02:34.255 --> 02:36.256
Bag the hands.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.287
Sure.

02:37.288 --> 02:39.259
(Megan) Dani...

02:39.260 --> 02:41.791
Be careful with her.

02:41.792 --> 02:45.395
Why would such a beautiful girl
kill herself on her wedding day?

02:45.396 --> 02:47.166
Who ever said
anything about suicide?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.338
Oh, you think this was staged?

02:48.339 --> 02:49.899
I got a roomful of
suspects in that bridal suite.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.271
My money?

02:51.272 --> 02:52.502
The groom.

02:52.503 --> 02:54.904
This is why I'm
never getting married.

02:54.905 --> 02:57.907
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

02:57.908 --> 03:00.280
(Police radio chatter)

03:00.281 --> 03:02.181
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

03:02.182 --> 03:05.185
(People speaking indistinctly)

03:06.217 --> 03:07.758
(Ethan) Hey.

03:13.364 --> 03:15.194
Do you mind?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.826
Oh, yeah, you can have my cake.

03:16.827 --> 03:18.268
I got a whole one in the fridge.

03:18.269 --> 03:20.730
No, you dumbass. Can't
you see I'm on a diet?

03:20.731 --> 03:22.732
Could you not eat that
heart attack in front of me?

03:22.733 --> 03:24.935
Oh, I'm sorry. (Whispers)
You're on a diet?

03:26.507 --> 03:28.408
I'll just move to a diff...

03:28.409 --> 03:30.340
Um, hey, Dani.

03:30.341 --> 03:32.742
That is not gon' end well.

03:32.743 --> 03:35.715
(Indistinct conversations)

03:35.716 --> 03:36.986
What's up?

03:36.987 --> 03:39.289
Bride just jumped to her
death on her wedding day.

03:39.290 --> 03:40.720
Oh. Wow.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.723
Uh... no, I don't
have a segue for that.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.795
Segue into what?

03:45.796 --> 03:47.957
Would you like to go
out with me Friday night,

03:47.958 --> 03:50.730
uh, to see, uh,
"prom zombies 4"?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.762
Ooh, I'd love to.

03:52.763 --> 03:55.465
Oh, but I have a
date Friday night.

03:55.466 --> 03:57.537
How about a Sunday matinee?

03:57.538 --> 03:59.869
Yeah. That's, uh,
a matinee sounds...

03:59.870 --> 04:01.411
Uh, it's a date.

04:01.412 --> 04:02.812
I mean, it's not a
date. It's a matinee.

04:02.813 --> 04:03.973
But, yeah, that...

04:03.974 --> 04:05.416
Sounds good. (Chuckles)

04:08.449 --> 04:10.249
(Megan) The body is that

04:10.250 --> 04:15.325
of a 65-inch,
115-pound female...

04:15.326 --> 04:16.456
Melissa waxman...

04:16.457 --> 04:19.889
Who appears to be of the
recorded age of 26 years.

04:19.890 --> 04:23.262
Most of her trauma
is on the left side.

04:23.263 --> 04:27.837
Massive blunt
force trauma injuries,

04:27.838 --> 04:29.899
pine needles, bark,

04:29.900 --> 04:31.471
and traces of sap.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.042
(Sighs deeply)
(Camera shutter clicking)

04:33.043 --> 04:34.574
Excuse me?

04:34.575 --> 04:37.407
I'm s... uh, does this
always have to take so long?

04:37.408 --> 04:39.349
Is there something that you
just have to know right now?

04:39.350 --> 04:41.381
Yeah, did she fall,

04:41.382 --> 04:42.912
did she jump, or was she pushed?

04:42.913 --> 04:45.455
A little Patience,
detective, please.

04:45.456 --> 04:46.916
(Clicking continues)
There is trace

04:46.917 --> 04:48.358
under her nails.

04:48.359 --> 04:50.289
Peter, get this
to the lab, please.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.321
Sure.

04:51.322 --> 04:52.392
Neck is hypermobile.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.564
Probable multiple
c-spine fractures.

04:54.565 --> 04:56.696
Also multiple
lacerations and abrasions

04:56.697 --> 04:59.569
with pitch residue
and bark particles.

04:59.570 --> 05:01.501
Probably fractured her neck
when she hit the wedding canopy.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.832
(Morris) I coulda told you that.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.434
What is wrong with him?

05:04.435 --> 05:06.476
I have no idea. Dial
it down, would you?

05:06.477 --> 05:08.408
Fine. I won't say another word.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.979
(Kate) Whoa. Hello.

05:09.980 --> 05:11.411
Oh.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.884
(Click)

05:17.418 --> 05:18.488
(Megan) Wow.

05:18.489 --> 05:20.089
Where is the other one?

05:20.090 --> 05:21.951
(Sam) Hmm. We didn't find
any jewelry on the scene.

05:21.952 --> 05:23.593
I have Melissa's scans.

05:23.594 --> 05:24.754
(Kate) Ah, good.

05:24.755 --> 05:25.925
(Blows air)

05:25.926 --> 05:27.627
(Clears throat)

05:27.628 --> 05:28.898
(Beeps)

05:28.899 --> 05:30.400
Skull fracture,

05:30.401 --> 05:32.001
depressed and linear.

05:32.002 --> 05:33.663
Left cervical spine.

05:33.664 --> 05:35.034
Clavicle.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.806
Compound spiral
tib-fib fracture.

05:36.807 --> 05:39.839
Bud, make yourself useful.
Hand me a wipe. Hmm?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.872
Uh, I could use a little help
over here, too, you know?

05:42.873 --> 05:45.044
(Whispers) Curtis is on a diet.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.676
He's all cranky and needy.

05:46.677 --> 05:49.348
I'm right here,
doofus. I can hear you.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.520
I didn't...

05:50.521 --> 05:51.981
And, yes, I'm friggin' hungry.

05:51.982 --> 05:52.983
(Peter chuckles)

05:59.129 --> 06:00.930
Is that what I think it is?

06:00.931 --> 06:03.693
A girl with a black eye
on her wedding day?

06:03.694 --> 06:05.795
Let's go pay the groom a visit.

06:05.796 --> 06:06.966
S-Stop.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.037
It's all your fault.

06:08.038 --> 06:09.399
Calm down, Leonard...

06:09.400 --> 06:10.370
You son of a
bitch, you killed her!

06:10.371 --> 06:11.741
Take it easy,
Leonard! Calm down!

06:11.742 --> 06:13.643
You killed my daughter!

06:13.644 --> 06:14.704
Oh!

06:14.705 --> 06:16.375
All right, step away, mister...

06:16.376 --> 06:17.907
Mr. Waxman!

06:17.908 --> 06:19.148
(Pants)

06:19.149 --> 06:20.650
(Fabric snaps)

06:20.651 --> 06:23.083
♪♪♪

06:29.119 --> 06:30.860
I don't see any other
signs of domestic abuse.

06:30.861 --> 06:32.061
But there is a transverse scar,

06:32.062 --> 06:34.864
anterior aspect of
the neck at the base.

06:34.865 --> 06:35.895
Possibly thyroidectomy.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.797
Hypopigmented scars

06:37.798 --> 06:39.068
and another transverse
scar, hip to hip.

06:39.069 --> 06:41.130
Our girl's had a
little work done.

06:41.131 --> 06:43.433
Looks like tummy
tuck and liposuction.

06:43.434 --> 06:45.074
Liposuction?

06:45.075 --> 06:47.077
Why didn't I think of that?

06:49.910 --> 06:53.043
Not for me. For
a friend of mine.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.615
She also had, uh,

06:55.616 --> 06:56.916
bilateral breast
augmentation as well.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.589
I have to say, this doctor
did remarkable work.

06:59.590 --> 07:00.920
How do you know that?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.692
I'm just saying.

07:02.693 --> 07:05.024
Check out the scar

07:05.025 --> 07:06.155
at the columella-
labial junction.

07:06.156 --> 07:07.697
You can hardly see it.

07:07.698 --> 07:09.459
Hmm. She had a nose job, too.

07:09.460 --> 07:11.100
(Sighs) Lacey asked for
one of those this morning.

07:11.101 --> 07:12.462
You're kidding.

07:12.463 --> 07:13.633
Mm. I wish.

07:13.634 --> 07:16.636
Why would Leonard
think you killed Melissa?

07:16.637 --> 07:18.638
He's always had it out for me.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.069
He never thought I
was good enough.

07:20.070 --> 07:21.811
Where were you when
Melissa fell from the balcony?

07:21.812 --> 07:24.474
Like I told your partner, I
was in my room getting ready.

07:24.475 --> 07:27.046
Melissa was a
very traditional girl.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.978
She didn't want me to
see her before the wedding.

07:28.979 --> 07:30.219
When was the last
time you did see her?

07:30.220 --> 07:32.021
Last night at the
rehearsal dinner.

07:32.022 --> 07:34.984
You slept in different
rooms? Really?

07:34.985 --> 07:38.988
Like I said, Melissa
was a very traditional girl.

07:38.989 --> 07:41.030
Was it tradition to give
Melissa a black eye?

07:41.031 --> 07:43.132
What black eye?

07:43.133 --> 07:44.794
The one she had to
cover with makeup.

07:44.795 --> 07:47.136
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

07:47.137 --> 07:48.669
How did you get
that cut on your hand?

07:50.070 --> 07:52.141
Ask Leonard.

07:52.142 --> 07:53.643
He killed her.

07:53.644 --> 07:55.144
He killed my baby.

07:55.145 --> 07:57.907
If that bastard had have
never asked her to marry him,

07:57.908 --> 07:59.178
none of this would've happened.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.050
Do you honestly think
your future son-in-law

08:01.051 --> 08:03.152
would've killed your
daughter on their wedding day?

08:03.153 --> 08:05.154
Who else? You tell me.

08:05.155 --> 08:07.987
Can you think of anyone who
would want to hurt Melissa?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.559
Everyone loved Melissa.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.491
Is it possible she
took her own life?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.223
No.

08:14.224 --> 08:17.528
A-Absolutely not.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.170
(Elevator bell dings)

08:21.171 --> 08:22.132
Bowling, seriously?

08:22.133 --> 08:24.133
I mean, you wouldn't
rather go to a movie?

08:24.134 --> 08:26.936
Why not? I think you'd look
cute in those funny shoes.

08:26.937 --> 08:27.937
(Chuckles)

08:27.938 --> 08:29.108
(Laughs)

08:29.109 --> 08:31.611
(Indistinct conversations)

08:31.612 --> 08:33.082
Ooh.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.584
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

08:34.585 --> 08:36.015
(Kate) So what's
your guess about

08:36.016 --> 08:37.647
why she had her
thyroid removed, goiter?

08:37.648 --> 08:40.189
Ah, probably
thyroiditis or cancer.

08:40.190 --> 08:41.891
Bud had to pull the father
of the bride off the groom.

08:41.892 --> 08:44.023
It looks like they got
into it at the hotel bar.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.625
Pardon me, fabio.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.627
That substance you
found under Melissa's nails

08:47.628 --> 08:50.059
was a floral anther,
which doesn't surprise me,

08:50.060 --> 08:52.101
because there were enough
flowers in that bridal suite

08:52.102 --> 08:53.803
to choke a Bumblebee.

08:53.804 --> 08:56.035
In addition to the
small amount of aspirin,

08:56.036 --> 08:57.266
her blood alcohol was .08,

08:57.267 --> 08:59.709
and she had significant levels
of alprazolam in her system.

08:59.710 --> 09:01.711
Antidepressants and alcohol...

09:01.712 --> 09:03.242
That's a deadly combination.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.944
Clearly a nervous bride.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.817
Ethan, have the lab run
thyroid levels on her blood.

09:07.818 --> 09:09.178
First thing in the
morning, call her internist.

09:09.179 --> 09:11.120
Find out why she
had a thyroidectomy.

09:11.121 --> 09:12.082
Okay.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.252
Hey, what is up with you?

09:13.253 --> 09:14.655
Like you don't know.

09:16.286 --> 09:17.657
(Morris) You were
her maid of honor.

09:17.658 --> 09:18.828
You had to notice something.

09:18.829 --> 09:20.760
I think Melissa was
having second thoughts

09:20.761 --> 09:22.231
about the wedding.

09:22.232 --> 09:23.292
Really? Why?

09:23.293 --> 09:24.834
I don't know exactly.

09:24.835 --> 09:26.165
But she wasn't
acting like herself

09:26.166 --> 09:27.967
at the bachelorette Botox party.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.839
(Laughs) The what?

09:29.840 --> 09:32.101
Bachelorette party... Botox,
mani-pedis, and a male stripper.

09:32.102 --> 09:34.143
I've never had a
mani-pedi like that.

09:34.144 --> 09:36.876
Melissa was agitated
and drinking heavily.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.008
Same thing yesterday
at the wedding.

09:39.009 --> 09:40.249
(Inhales)

09:40.250 --> 09:42.181
She even asked me for a Xanax.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.984
Then why did you leave her
alone before the ceremony?

09:44.985 --> 09:47.016
When we put the veil on her,

09:47.017 --> 09:48.117
it ripped.

09:48.118 --> 09:49.318
She came unglued.

09:49.319 --> 09:51.190
She told us all to leave.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.592
So what do you
think set her off?

09:53.593 --> 09:54.924
She never said specifically,

09:54.925 --> 09:57.166
but I know that her
ex-boyfriend is back in town.

09:57.167 --> 09:59.670
I think he still had
feelings for her.

10:01.031 --> 10:02.131
(Sam) Hmm.

10:02.132 --> 10:04.834
Lacey, you haven't
touched your food.

10:04.835 --> 10:07.076
I'm not that hungry.

10:07.077 --> 10:08.377
Listen...

10:08.378 --> 10:12.211
When I was your age, grandma
made me feel like I was fat,

10:12.212 --> 10:13.143
and I wasn't.

10:13.144 --> 10:16.115
There will be no food
issues in this house.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.288
You're still growing.
You need to eat.

10:19.289 --> 10:21.190
All right, try this...

10:21.191 --> 10:23.252
No eating, no computer.

10:23.253 --> 10:25.124
Mom!

10:25.125 --> 10:27.156
(Cell phone rings)

10:27.157 --> 10:28.858
(Cup clanks)

10:28.859 --> 10:30.029
(Ring)

10:30.030 --> 10:31.260
Megan hunt.

10:31.261 --> 10:32.232
Hey, it's Ethan.

10:32.233 --> 10:33.763
Uh, I spoke with
Melissa's doctor.

10:33.764 --> 10:35.104
He said the
thyroidectomy was needed

10:35.105 --> 10:37.937
because of
hashimoto's thyroiditis.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.969
Did he say what he prescribed
to keep her hormones in check?

10:39.970 --> 10:42.241
Levothyroxine. 50
micrograms a day.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.243
But I ran the hormone
levels you requested.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.015
Here's the strange part...

10:46.016 --> 10:48.748
Her t.S.H. Level was sky high.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.250
Well, that means she wasn't
taking her thyroid medicine.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.924
No wonder she was
depressed at her wedding.

10:54.925 --> 10:57.927
(Sighs) Oh, god.

10:57.928 --> 11:00.060
Maybe she jumped.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.168
(Men) ♪ I'm so far out ♪

11:09.169 --> 11:10.940
♪ now my mind is gone ♪

11:10.941 --> 11:12.171

11:16.106 --> 11:17.276

11:17.277 --> 11:19.308
Please tell me you're kidding.

11:19.309 --> 11:21.711
Everyone wears clothes
like this. Cute, right?

11:21.712 --> 11:22.852
No, not right.

11:22.853 --> 11:24.283
You do realize the
message you're sending

11:24.284 --> 11:25.885
when you dress like that?

11:25.886 --> 11:26.956
Seriously?

11:26.957 --> 11:29.188
Don't be smart.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.760
Well... (Sighs)

11:30.761 --> 11:32.161
Well, why don't you take
me to your hairdresser?

11:32.162 --> 11:33.723
You want to get a haircut?

11:33.724 --> 11:35.725
No. I want highlights.

11:35.726 --> 11:37.066
You're not dyeing your hair.

11:37.067 --> 11:38.697
Why not? You do.

11:38.698 --> 11:39.899
And I am slave to it.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.801
You're not dressing
like a hooker,

11:41.802 --> 11:42.972
you're not dyeing your hair,

11:42.973 --> 11:44.303
and you're not
getting a nose job.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.975
What is going on with you?

11:45.976 --> 11:48.077
♪ ...i even knew it,
she was out of here ♪

11:48.078 --> 11:50.709
♪ I'm so far out ♪

11:50.710 --> 11:53.783
Maybe Melissa forgot to
take her thyroid medicine

11:53.784 --> 11:55.915
because she was
anxious about the wedding.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.387
And going cold
Turkey has side effects

11:58.388 --> 11:59.989
of irritability and depression.

11:59.990 --> 12:01.250
We're not buying it.

12:01.251 --> 12:03.422
There was no note and
no prior attempts at suicide.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.424
Usually people
who commit suicide

12:05.425 --> 12:07.226
leave some sign
of their intentions.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.358
Plus, we just found out
she had an ex-boyfriend

12:09.359 --> 12:11.160
who had strong feelings for her.

12:11.161 --> 12:14.103
I'm sure he's none to happy
she was marrying someone else.

12:14.104 --> 12:16.836
Yes, people who commit
suicide often signal their intentions.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.267
Not always.

12:18.268 --> 12:19.969
(Peter) And Melissa
was intoxicated

12:19.970 --> 12:21.740
and taking antidepressants.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.742
If you two are so convinced
she committed suicide,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.815
why are you still investigating?

12:25.816 --> 12:27.276
Because I want to know why.

12:27.277 --> 12:28.978
Why what?

12:28.979 --> 12:30.749
Why she did it.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.283
Did Melissa have a
history of depression?

12:34.284 --> 12:35.985
(Leonard) Why?

12:35.986 --> 12:37.286
We're just trying to
understand her state of mind

12:37.287 --> 12:39.188
the day she died.

12:39.189 --> 12:41.160
Well...

12:41.161 --> 12:43.162
Melissa's mother
died when she was 13.

12:43.163 --> 12:46.295
She became depressed
and put on weight.

12:46.296 --> 12:47.436
And she was always shy,

12:47.437 --> 12:49.298
so you can imagine what
her teenage years were like.

12:49.299 --> 12:50.940
Did she see a therapist?

12:50.941 --> 12:53.372
Yeah, through high
school and college.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.805
It wasn't until after she
had her thyroid removed

12:55.806 --> 12:57.206
that things got better.

12:57.207 --> 12:59.308
She was at risk for
the same thyroid cancer

12:59.309 --> 13:02.411
that killed her mother,
but after the surgery, she...

13:02.412 --> 13:04.413
She began to live
life, meet new friends.

13:04.414 --> 13:06.515
That's when she met Zack,

13:06.516 --> 13:08.117
her ex-boyfriend.

13:08.118 --> 13:10.419
If she was happy, then
why all the cosmetic surgery?

13:10.420 --> 13:14.363
Well, she had such strong
feelings for Zack, but, um,

13:14.364 --> 13:16.565
she was just never happy
with the way she looked.

13:16.566 --> 13:19.198
(Leonard) I was against
the plastic surgery.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.200
You know, that's...
(Taps tabletop)

13:21.201 --> 13:23.272
When our relationship
took a turn for the worse.

13:23.273 --> 13:26.075
You know, she said I
didn't understand her,

13:26.076 --> 13:29.578
wanted me to stop telling
her how to live her life.

13:29.579 --> 13:32.041
Our relationship was
strained ever since.

13:32.042 --> 13:33.512
I mean, how would
you feel if your daughter

13:33.513 --> 13:35.285
wanted to change
everything about herself?

13:38.318 --> 13:41.590
Uh, do you know the
name of the plastic surgeon?

13:41.591 --> 13:43.422
Yes, Dr. Sarah Hughes.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.895
When could you
release Melissa to us?

13:45.896 --> 13:47.297
We'd like to...

13:50.100 --> 13:51.400
Bury her the day after tomorrow.

13:51.401 --> 13:53.933
We're flying back to
Miami after the funeral.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.165
We'll try to expedite
the process for you.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.207
Thank you.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.911
Came out here for
a wedding, and...

14:02.412 --> 14:06.446
Instead, I'm gonna be
attending my baby's funeral.

14:13.423 --> 14:15.384
Zack goffman?

14:15.385 --> 14:16.356
Yes.

14:16.357 --> 14:17.526
Detective bud Morris.

14:17.527 --> 14:19.088
This is my partner...
Detective baker.

14:19.089 --> 14:21.160
We're investigating the
death of Melissa waxman.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.461
We understand that
you and Melissa dated

14:22.462 --> 14:23.632
for a couple of years.

14:23.633 --> 14:26.395
Yes, we were...
(Sighs) Very close.

14:26.396 --> 14:27.566
Well, not that close.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.438
She was about to
marry someone else.

14:29.439 --> 14:31.170
Why'd you break up?

14:31.171 --> 14:32.972
I took a job in L.A.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.504
And, uh, the long-distance
thing didn't work out,

14:35.505 --> 14:37.346
so I moved back here, hoping
to pick up where we left off,

14:37.347 --> 14:39.278
and she was already
engaged to Marc.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.910
(Inhales sharply) Ouch.

14:40.911 --> 14:43.182
Not exactly the homecoming
you were expecting, huh?

14:43.183 --> 14:44.353
What do you think?

14:44.354 --> 14:45.514
What do I think?

14:45.515 --> 14:46.585
I think you were pissed...

14:46.586 --> 14:48.457
So pissed, you helped
her off that balcony.

14:48.458 --> 14:49.959
That's what I think.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.291
And I think I'm done
talking with you.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.923
(Door slams)

14:53.924 --> 14:55.424
What is with you?

14:55.425 --> 14:57.196
I'm exhausted.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.497
Jeannie's up all
night, I'm up all night.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.599
Well, stop taking it
out on everybody else.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.571
And lay off the coffee.

15:02.572 --> 15:05.474
You think I'm bitchy now?
Wait till I stop drinking coffee.

15:05.475 --> 15:06.576
(Sighs)

15:11.211 --> 15:12.511
(Ethan) So how's your diet?

15:12.512 --> 15:13.682
Great.

15:13.683 --> 15:15.544
You hungry? Can
we not talk about this?

15:15.545 --> 15:17.646
Sure.

15:17.647 --> 15:19.488
Hey, do you think I'm sexy?

15:19.489 --> 15:21.490
You have got to be kidding me.

15:21.491 --> 15:23.322
Dani's dating Peter.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.994
I mean, what does he have
that I don't have? I don't get it.

15:24.995 --> 15:26.525
Because Peter don't
ask stupid questions like,

15:26.526 --> 15:28.127
"do you think I'm sexy?"

15:28.128 --> 15:29.398
He's confident.
He... he walks up to...

15:29.399 --> 15:31.000
You know what? I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

15:31.001 --> 15:33.262
Fine. Well, can we do this?

15:33.263 --> 15:35.464
Yeah, sure.

15:35.465 --> 15:36.966
So... (Inhales deeply)

15:36.967 --> 15:38.968
Do you think she was pushed
or do you think she jumped?

15:38.969 --> 15:40.469
That's what the dummy's
supposed to tell us,

15:40.470 --> 15:43.042
the trajectory of
her fall. I know.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.613
But considering there's
a chair against the rail,

15:44.614 --> 15:46.215
i'm-a go with she jumped.

15:46.216 --> 15:49.018
Okay, so she stood up like this?

15:49.019 --> 15:50.549
Ethan, get down. Why?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.551
Because I don't want the
wrong dummy going over.

15:52.552 --> 15:56.155
Oh, Curtis. You care.
That is so swe... (gasps)

15:56.156 --> 15:57.327
Don't...

15:58.558 --> 16:00.489
Shut up, you dummy, and
help me with the dummy.

16:00.490 --> 16:01.630
(Chuckles) Okay, come on.

16:01.631 --> 16:03.592
(Laughs) Oh. Ouch.

16:03.593 --> 16:06.065
Put her legs over. Be
careful. She's a lady.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.466
You ready?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.538
(Both) One. Two.

16:09.539 --> 16:10.670
Three.

16:13.503 --> 16:14.444
(Dummy clanks)

16:14.445 --> 16:17.006
Well, how's that,
Mr. Trajectory?

16:17.007 --> 16:18.447
What does that tell you?

16:18.448 --> 16:20.480
That your skinny ass
going down there to get her.

16:22.352 --> 16:23.483
Hey, what's that?

16:25.355 --> 16:26.486
Hmm.

16:29.019 --> 16:30.359
(Peter) Bud has
a point, you know?

16:30.360 --> 16:31.490
We seem to be investigating

16:31.491 --> 16:33.022
the cause of
someone's depression

16:33.023 --> 16:34.523
instead of their death.

16:34.524 --> 16:36.195
It's kind of a little
outside our purview.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.696
What is your point?

16:37.697 --> 16:40.429
Is this about Melissa
or someone else?

16:40.430 --> 16:42.301
(Sighs) Okay.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.503
Yes, my father
didn't leave a note,

16:44.504 --> 16:47.176
and, yes, sometimes
at 3:00 in the morning,

16:47.177 --> 16:49.278
I wake up and...

16:49.279 --> 16:50.679
I wonder why.

16:50.680 --> 16:53.442
What if you find the
answer and you don't like it?

16:53.443 --> 16:54.743
Joke's on me, I guess.

16:54.744 --> 16:56.415
(Door opens)

16:56.416 --> 16:58.387
Sorry to keep you waiting.

16:58.388 --> 17:00.789
You're from the medical
examiner's office?

17:00.790 --> 17:03.322
Yes. I am Dr. Megan hunt.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.493
This is investigator dunlop.

17:04.494 --> 17:05.624
Please.

17:05.625 --> 17:09.658
We're looking into the
death of Melissa waxman.

17:09.659 --> 17:11.560
Oh, god. It was horrible.

17:11.561 --> 17:13.562
You were there?
Yeah, I'd just arrived.

17:13.563 --> 17:15.033
You were invited to her wedding?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.665
Yeah. She was one
of my favorite clients.

17:16.666 --> 17:18.107
I'll bet.

17:18.108 --> 17:20.369
Could you please explain
to me how you could operate

17:20.370 --> 17:23.142
on someone with
such low self-esteem?

17:23.143 --> 17:24.613
You don't know what
you're talking about.

17:24.614 --> 17:26.315
Really? She actually needed

17:26.316 --> 17:28.377
rhinoplasty, abdominoplasty,

17:28.378 --> 17:31.420
liposuction, and
breast augmentation?

17:31.421 --> 17:33.552
I don't appreciate
the suggestion

17:33.553 --> 17:36.054
that I talked her into anything.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.327
Look, this is something
Melissa wanted for years...

17:38.328 --> 17:40.159
A body that felt good to her,

17:40.160 --> 17:42.491
her idea of how she should look.

17:42.492 --> 17:44.093
Her idea or your idea?

17:44.094 --> 17:47.065
Dr. Hunt, I don't
make those decisions.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.139
I leave that up to the
magazines and media.

17:50.140 --> 17:52.301
So you don't think
that she was suicidal?

17:52.302 --> 17:53.602
Far from it.

17:53.603 --> 17:56.705
Look... (Chuckles) Melissa
had a full psych evaluation

17:56.706 --> 17:58.777
when I met her two
and a half years ago,

17:58.778 --> 18:00.579
and until yesterday,

18:00.580 --> 18:03.212
she was a well-adjusted,
stable young woman

18:03.213 --> 18:05.514
with no evidence of
body dysmorphic disorder.

18:05.515 --> 18:09.688
Okay, sorry for the
inconvenience, doctor.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.660
You know, we're not all
the snake oil salesmen

18:11.661 --> 18:13.562
people make us out to be.

18:13.563 --> 18:16.565
We actually try to make people
feel good about themselves.

18:16.566 --> 18:17.626
Dr. Hunt.

18:17.627 --> 18:20.229
Have you ever
considered a face lift?

18:20.230 --> 18:21.670
You're at that age.

18:21.671 --> 18:23.132
(Chuckles)

18:23.133 --> 18:26.535
Why thank you. You first.

18:26.536 --> 18:27.676
One more thing.

18:27.677 --> 18:29.738
Who actually paid
for Melissa's surgery?

18:29.739 --> 18:32.581
I-I know she couldn't afford
it on a teacher's salary.

18:32.582 --> 18:35.315
Her ex-boyfriend Zack.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.620
(Indistinct conversations)

18:46.196 --> 18:47.657
Oh! Gee.

18:50.260 --> 18:52.601
(Speaks indistinctly)

18:52.602 --> 18:54.203
(Sniffs)

18:54.204 --> 18:55.735
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

18:57.737 --> 19:00.439
Seriously, food in the morgue?

19:00.440 --> 19:01.840
(People speaking indistinctly)

19:01.841 --> 19:03.643
Yeah, I know.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.875
So what are you looking at?

19:06.876 --> 19:08.447
These are Melissa's scans.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.449
See this opacity right here?

19:10.450 --> 19:11.750
Yeah.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.352
At first I thought it was
just debris on the film.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.783
But now... (Sighs)

19:14.784 --> 19:20.789
Let's go take a
look at that leg.

19:20.790 --> 19:23.532
Mm.

19:23.533 --> 19:26.164
Ethan, hand me the
small forceps, please.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.397
Mm-hmm.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.377
(Footsteps approach)

19:38.378 --> 19:39.878
What'd you find?

19:39.879 --> 19:43.382
Looks like a metallic
paint chip of some kind.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.483
From the compound fracture?

19:44.484 --> 19:45.684
Yeah.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.885
(Ethan) Wait, wait,
wait. Hold on a second.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.787
We found paint chipping on
the railing of the bridal suite.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.259
I should have a
photograph of that.

19:50.260 --> 19:51.660
Of course you do, Mr. Perfect.

19:51.661 --> 19:54.263
Wait. Melissa's leg
fracture was antemortem.

19:54.264 --> 19:56.495
So she didn't break it from
landing on the wedding canopy.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.497
She broke it because it
got caught in the railing.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.799
That means Melissa didn't jump.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.673
She was pushed.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.478
I read all your e-mails, Zack.

20:09.479 --> 20:10.639
You been trying

20:10.640 --> 20:12.741
to get back together
with Melissa for months.

20:12.742 --> 20:15.244
That must have
really burned you up...

20:15.245 --> 20:17.246
Paying for all those
plastic surgeries,

20:17.247 --> 20:17.987
and then she dumps you.

20:17.988 --> 20:19.948
She didn't dump me. We broke up.

20:19.949 --> 20:22.791
Either way, you certainly
didn't want her marrying Marc.

20:22.792 --> 20:25.254
Of course Marc wasn't
good enough for her.

20:25.255 --> 20:27.556
How could he be?

20:27.557 --> 20:28.897
He didn't love
her the way I did.

20:28.898 --> 20:31.260
He didn't know
her the way I did.

20:31.261 --> 20:34.463
He wasn't with her through
all her surgery, I was.

20:34.464 --> 20:37.005
But I loved her the way
she was before her surgery.

20:37.006 --> 20:39.007
Why'd you let her
do that to herself?

20:39.008 --> 20:41.270
Because it's what
she wanted. I just...

20:41.271 --> 20:43.813
I wanted to make her happy.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.946
I think I've got
everything I need.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.018
Thanks for coming by.

20:50.019 --> 20:52.481
Cancel all your
travel plans, though.

20:52.482 --> 20:55.685
(People speaking indistinctly)

20:59.459 --> 21:01.560
Let me ask you something.

21:01.561 --> 21:02.891
How could I have killed Melissa

21:02.892 --> 21:04.633
if I wasn't even
invited to the wedding?

21:04.634 --> 21:07.496
Since when do you need an
invitation to commit murder?

21:07.497 --> 21:11.501
(Indistinct conversations)

21:13.573 --> 21:16.044
Two cheesesteaks with the works.

21:16.045 --> 21:18.276
Hey, listen, I know that
we're supposed to be

21:18.277 --> 21:19.578
going bowling on Friday night,

21:19.579 --> 21:21.850
but a buddy of mine
has tickets on the glass

21:21.851 --> 21:23.412
to the flyers game.

21:23.413 --> 21:25.013
You don't mind, right?

21:25.014 --> 21:26.386
Oh.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.689
What, you're upset?

21:30.690 --> 21:32.421
Well, yeah.

21:32.422 --> 21:34.863
I just thought...

21:34.864 --> 21:36.595
You know what?

21:36.596 --> 21:38.367
Never mind.

21:38.368 --> 21:39.368
You should go.

21:39.369 --> 21:40.469
Are you sure?

21:40.470 --> 21:43.302
Absolutely.

21:44.974 --> 21:47.606
Here are all the photos
from the day of the wedding.

21:47.607 --> 21:50.339
I would like them back as
soon as you're finished, please.

21:50.340 --> 21:53.311
They must be very
difficult for you to look at.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.344
They're all I have left of her.

21:55.345 --> 21:56.885
At least I finally
got to see her

21:56.886 --> 21:58.387
in her wedding dress, though.

21:58.388 --> 21:59.518
(People speaking indistinctly)

21:59.519 --> 22:01.950
She looked so beautiful.

22:01.951 --> 22:05.053
What do you know
about Zack goffman?

22:05.054 --> 22:06.555
(Sighs) Zack was definitely

22:06.556 --> 22:09.057
a sore spot in our relationship.

22:09.058 --> 22:10.899
Melissa was still
friends with him,

22:10.900 --> 22:12.060
so I tried to be understanding,

22:12.061 --> 22:13.902
but he would not
take no for an answer.

22:13.903 --> 22:15.404
How so?

22:15.405 --> 22:17.536
He would send e-mails, flowers.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.108
He even waited for
Melissa in front of her work.

22:20.109 --> 22:21.910
Then about a month ago,

22:21.911 --> 22:23.512
he confronted me
outside my house,

22:23.513 --> 22:25.374
and that's when Melissa
finally had had enough.

22:25.375 --> 22:27.016
She cut off all
contact with him.

22:30.049 --> 22:34.122
(People speaking indistinctly)

22:34.123 --> 22:35.984
Bud.

22:35.985 --> 22:37.526
Congratulations.

22:37.527 --> 22:40.128
It was not a suicide.

22:40.129 --> 22:41.830
Okay, you were right.

22:41.831 --> 22:43.562
(Morris, Peter, and
Sam laugh) Jeez.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.064
Oh, look at Melissa.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.567
She certainly didn't look
depressed at her wedding.

22:48.568 --> 22:51.039
(Sam) Mnh-mnh. I
remember my wedding day.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.702
Knew it was a mistake the
minute I walked down the aisle.

22:53.703 --> 22:55.674
Then why did you
go through with it?

22:55.675 --> 22:56.805
My mother would've killed me.

22:56.806 --> 22:57.976
(Laughs)

22:57.977 --> 22:59.448
Jeannie and I eloped...

22:59.449 --> 23:01.810
Niagara Falls,
carnation bouquet,

23:01.811 --> 23:03.151
baked Alaska, boxed wine.

23:03.152 --> 23:04.382
Okay, so hold on.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.884
Why am I just hearing
about this now?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.416
Well, it's not
like it's a secret.

23:07.417 --> 23:08.717
We just didn't have the money.

23:08.718 --> 23:10.589
Can you imagine what a
wedding like Melissa's costs?

23:10.590 --> 23:12.060
Well, speaking of that,

23:12.061 --> 23:13.892
who actually paid for
Melissa's wedding?

23:13.893 --> 23:15.393
Well, father of the
bride, traditionally.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.395
It's worth looking into, though.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.697
Leonard was
estranged from Melissa,

23:18.698 --> 23:20.168
didn't approve of the wedding.

23:20.169 --> 23:22.731
It'd be salt in the
wound to foot the bill.

23:22.732 --> 23:24.533
So he killed her because
the bill was too high?

23:24.534 --> 23:26.404
(Sam laughs)

23:26.405 --> 23:28.406
Okay, so far, we can't place
anyone in that bridal suite

23:28.407 --> 23:30.479
before the ceremony
except for Melissa.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.840
What about the bridesmaids?

23:31.841 --> 23:34.543
The bridesmaids all
left the suite at 1:30

23:34.544 --> 23:36.184
to go down to the wedding.

23:36.185 --> 23:37.946
We checked with hotel security,

23:37.947 --> 23:41.620
and no one entered the suite
after 1:00 P.M. without a key.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.592
Maybe Melissa let them in.

23:43.593 --> 23:44.993
So in a hotel full of
family and friends,

23:44.994 --> 23:47.195
that doesn't exactly
narrow it down.

23:47.196 --> 23:48.727
Why is it taking so long to get

23:48.728 --> 23:50.428
the elevator surveillance
video from the hotel?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.461
(Sam) Hotel lawyered up.
They're worried about liability.

23:52.462 --> 23:54.032
(Morris) I'll lean on 'em.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.765
Sam... did you say
that everyone got Botox

23:56.766 --> 23:58.537
at that bachelorette party?

23:58.538 --> 23:59.868
(Sam) Mm-hmm.

23:59.869 --> 24:01.810
Care to explain

24:01.811 --> 24:07.846
why you gave Melissa aspirin
right after she had Botox?

24:07.847 --> 24:10.218
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:10.219 --> 24:11.720
Yes, you do. You're a nurse.

24:11.721 --> 24:13.181
You know that aspirin
inhibits coagulation,

24:13.182 --> 24:15.924
and when you combine
aspirin with Botox injections,

24:15.925 --> 24:17.455
you get a black eye.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.688
You gave Melissa aspirin

24:19.689 --> 24:21.560
right before her ceremony

24:21.561 --> 24:23.161
and you gave Melissa aspirin

24:23.162 --> 24:25.534
at her Botox bachelorette party.

24:25.535 --> 24:27.967
And I thought you and
Melissa were friends.

24:29.739 --> 24:31.239
We were.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.872
Were?

24:33.873 --> 24:36.204
Why'd you want to
ruin her wedding day?

24:36.205 --> 24:38.246
Maybe it didn't end there.

24:38.247 --> 24:40.879
Maybe...

24:40.880 --> 24:43.481
You pushed Melissa
off that balcony.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.715
No, I would never do that.

24:46.716 --> 24:49.688
Sure, I was jealous of her,
but I would never kill her.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.059
You just couldn't stand

24:51.060 --> 24:53.792
that you weren't the
queen bee anymore.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.063
I mean, don't get me wrong.

24:55.064 --> 24:56.595
You're doing the best
with what you have.

24:56.596 --> 24:59.267
But, boy, she changed
her looks, and wow.

24:59.268 --> 25:01.531
You just couldn't measure up.

25:02.772 --> 25:06.204
I met Marc first, okay?

25:06.205 --> 25:08.506
I was at the bar
waiting for Melissa.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.139
He walks up and
starts talking to me.

25:11.140 --> 25:15.113
Then Melissa shows up, and
it's like I don't exist anymore.

25:15.114 --> 25:18.286
All Marc was
interested in was her.

25:18.287 --> 25:20.919
I never wanted to hurt Melissa.

25:20.920 --> 25:24.023
I was just paying her back
for stealing Marc from me.

25:25.294 --> 25:28.196
I don't think
Melissa stole Marc.

25:28.197 --> 25:32.030
I think that Marc chose Melissa.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.764
You couldn't handle it.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.706
Move over and jump in.

25:37.707 --> 25:39.137
(Ethan) Please let me do it.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.268
Ethan, I got it. Would you
just please let me do it?

25:40.269 --> 25:41.640
I'll figure it out, okay?
Just please let me do it.

25:41.641 --> 25:42.811
Ethan.

25:42.812 --> 25:44.573
What are you two up to?

25:44.574 --> 25:46.214
We found a hair
on Melissa's earring.

25:46.215 --> 25:47.545
It doesn't match her hair color,

25:47.546 --> 25:48.917
so we're sending it to the lab.

25:48.918 --> 25:50.849
Fine, but, Curtis, let
Ethan handle it from here.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.180
I want you to finish
the goldberg report.

25:52.181 --> 25:53.722
You're spreading
yourself too thin.

25:53.723 --> 25:55.183
You can't do everything.

25:55.184 --> 25:58.186
(Indistinct conversations)

25:58.187 --> 26:00.759
Let me see those results
as soon as you get 'em.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.632
No, 'cause Kate just told
you to let me handle it, so...

26:03.633 --> 26:04.963
Ethan, you don't want
to mess with me, boy.

26:04.964 --> 26:07.135
I know that's just
the hunger talking!

26:07.136 --> 26:09.038
Mm.

26:10.900 --> 26:13.271
(Door opens)

26:13.272 --> 26:14.603
Lace?

26:14.604 --> 26:15.774
(Door closes)

26:15.775 --> 26:16.976
Hi, mom.

26:24.153 --> 26:25.754
What the hell did you do?

26:25.755 --> 26:27.585
I had my hair colored.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.057
By whom, lady gaga?

26:29.058 --> 26:30.959
By Alice with some
over-the-counter stuff.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.661
Fine, then we can get it out.

26:32.662 --> 26:33.992
What?

26:33.993 --> 26:36.164
You heard me. I said you
could not color your hair.

26:36.165 --> 26:39.228
I'm not changing it,
and you can't make me!

26:40.700 --> 26:41.870
(Door slams)

26:41.871 --> 26:43.301
(Cell phone rings and buzzes)

26:43.302 --> 26:44.803
(Sighs)

26:44.804 --> 26:49.307
(Rings and buzzes)

26:49.308 --> 26:50.909
(Ring)

26:50.910 --> 26:52.641
Megan hunt.

26:52.642 --> 26:53.942
I'm at the hotel.

26:53.943 --> 26:55.283
I finally got 'em
to let me watch

26:55.284 --> 26:56.745
the elevator surveillance video.

26:56.746 --> 26:58.787
Guess what.

26:58.788 --> 27:00.218
Zack lied.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.220
He was here at the wedding.

27:02.221 --> 27:05.294
That son of a bitch killed her.

27:10.259 --> 27:11.730
(Door opens)

27:11.731 --> 27:12.801
You lied to me, Zack.
You were at that wedding.

27:12.802 --> 27:14.763
I lied because I thought
you'd never believe me.

27:14.764 --> 27:17.666
Oh, you got that right,
sunshine. Now sit down.

27:17.667 --> 27:18.738
I said take a seat!

27:21.941 --> 27:23.712
(Sighs)

27:23.713 --> 27:25.714
I went there...

27:25.715 --> 27:27.245
I went there to stop Melissa

27:27.246 --> 27:29.417
from making the
biggest mistake of her life.

27:29.418 --> 27:31.649
Marc didn't love her.
He barely knew her.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.221
He... he fell in love with her
because of how she looked,

27:33.222 --> 27:34.652
not for who she was.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.924
How would you know?

27:35.925 --> 27:39.788
Because love
takes time, detective.

27:39.789 --> 27:41.830
It takes commitment,

27:41.831 --> 27:44.032
Patience, sacrifice.

27:44.033 --> 27:46.665
Melissa was my soul mate.

27:49.398 --> 27:51.700
I went to see her to talk
her out of marrying Marc

27:51.701 --> 27:53.001
one last time.

27:53.002 --> 27:55.203
And she said no one last time.

27:55.204 --> 27:56.674
I did not kill Melissa!

27:56.675 --> 27:58.346
We have you on the
elevator surveillance tapes

27:58.347 --> 28:00.078
going up but not going down.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.780
What, you take the back stairs?

28:01.781 --> 28:04.112
Why would you try to sneak
away unnoticed like that?

28:04.113 --> 28:06.755
Because I saw Melissa's
father getting off the elevator.

28:06.756 --> 28:08.717
You saw Leonard

28:08.718 --> 28:10.388
heading towards the
bridal suite after you left?

28:10.389 --> 28:11.920
Yes.

28:11.921 --> 28:13.922
And I took the stairs because
I didn't want him to see me.

28:13.923 --> 28:15.223
Leonard hated me

28:15.224 --> 28:17.295
because I paid for
Melissa's cosmetic surgeries.

28:17.296 --> 28:20.299
The last time I saw him,
he threatened to kill me.

28:22.972 --> 28:24.903
(Clicks keyboard keys and mouse)

28:24.904 --> 28:27.005
Is that my goldberg report?

28:27.006 --> 28:28.777
Not yet. I'm waiting on

28:28.778 --> 28:30.779
the d.N.A. Results
from the hair we found.

28:30.780 --> 28:32.841
I told you specifically
to let Ethan handle that.

28:32.842 --> 28:34.743
I know, but I got a hunch about...
Curtis, we've been over this.

28:34.744 --> 28:35.884
What are you trying to prove?

28:35.885 --> 28:37.715
Trying to prove? I'm
trying to do a good job.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.820
I've had six callstoday
about that case, all right?

28:41.821 --> 28:42.821
You're trying to do
everything at once

28:42.822 --> 28:43.992
and you're not
finishing anything.

28:43.993 --> 28:46.295
Just file that report.

29:00.770 --> 29:02.240
(Ethan sighs)

29:02.241 --> 29:04.472
(People speaking indistinctly)

29:04.473 --> 29:05.514
(Clatters)

29:06.916 --> 29:09.017
Please don't tell anybody.

29:09.018 --> 29:11.349
I'm not gonna tell anybody.
I mean, it's your diet.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.251
You can quit if you want to.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.323
I know.

29:15.324 --> 29:17.155
Can I sit down?

29:17.156 --> 29:20.159
(People speaking indistinctly)

29:22.892 --> 29:24.933
In med school,

29:24.934 --> 29:26.064
I had this teacher...

29:26.065 --> 29:28.797
This amazing
teacher... Dr. Giorgi,

29:28.798 --> 29:31.800
and she had this sign
above her door that said,

29:31.801 --> 29:33.301
"it's not what you eat.

29:33.302 --> 29:35.104
It's what's eating you."

29:36.375 --> 29:38.776
So what's eating you?

29:38.777 --> 29:41.550
Nothing.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.382
Come on, Curtis.

29:44.383 --> 29:48.056
I'm your friend. I know
something's bothering you.

29:48.057 --> 29:49.819
What is it?

29:52.491 --> 29:54.223
Somet...

29:56.125 --> 29:58.226
(voice breaking) Sometimes...

29:58.227 --> 30:00.930
I feel like I'm not good enough.

30:02.571 --> 30:04.833
Brother,

30:04.834 --> 30:08.937
I have been feeling
the same way lately.

30:08.938 --> 30:10.940
(Sighs)

30:17.386 --> 30:19.217
Have a seat.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.989
How could you people?

30:20.990 --> 30:23.992
My daughter's
funeral is in two hours.

30:23.993 --> 30:26.394
Mr. Waxman, you didn't
tell us that you were

30:26.395 --> 30:29.397
in Melissa's bridal suite
prior to the wedding.

30:29.398 --> 30:30.828
(Sighs)

30:30.829 --> 30:33.831
I-I went to see Melissa to
ask her to call off the wedding,

30:33.832 --> 30:35.964
only I went too far.

30:35.965 --> 30:36.936
Go on.

30:36.937 --> 30:38.136
I thought she
was rushing into it

30:38.137 --> 30:40.308
specifically 'cause
I didn't want her to.

30:40.309 --> 30:44.012
And, um...

30:44.013 --> 30:45.313
I told her Marc
couldn't love her

30:45.314 --> 30:47.445
after knowing her
for such a short time.

30:47.446 --> 30:48.846
And?

30:48.847 --> 30:53.151
I thought she killed herself
because of what I said.

30:53.152 --> 30:55.853
I didn't tell you
because I felt guilty.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.425
Oh, you're guilty of something.

30:57.426 --> 30:59.557
I didn't kill my own
daughter, detective.

30:59.558 --> 31:03.061
Can we talk about a, uh, clause

31:03.062 --> 31:04.862
in your deceased wife's will?

31:04.863 --> 31:07.065
We did a little checking
into your financials.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.067
Apparently, your late wife Anna

31:09.068 --> 31:11.869
left you and your daughter
quite a bit of money.

31:11.870 --> 31:15.073
Now Melissa would've
received hers upon marriage

31:15.074 --> 31:17.875
unless she didn't marry
or you survived her,

31:17.876 --> 31:20.578
and then... You get it all.

31:20.579 --> 31:23.611
Money is a very powerful
motive, Mr. Waxman.

31:23.612 --> 31:25.413
I didn't kill Melissa.

31:25.414 --> 31:28.456
What time did you leave
the bridal suite that day?

31:28.457 --> 31:29.657
It was around quarter to 2:00,

31:29.658 --> 31:31.559
and she was still
very much alive.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.261
(Scoffs)

31:33.262 --> 31:36.926
Yeah, I'm not answering
another question.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.298
So if you're not
gonna arrest me,

31:40.299 --> 31:42.901
I'm gonna go Bury my daughter.

31:47.937 --> 31:49.077
(Door closes)

31:49.078 --> 31:52.141
(Plastic rustling)

31:58.917 --> 32:00.048
Hey, Dani.

32:00.049 --> 32:01.489
Yeah.

32:01.490 --> 32:03.351
Uh... (Exhales)

32:03.352 --> 32:05.053
(People speaking indistinctly)

32:05.054 --> 32:07.195
What's wrong with me?

32:07.196 --> 32:09.027
What?

32:09.028 --> 32:12.060
What's wrong with me?

32:12.061 --> 32:13.301
I mean, I'm smart,

32:13.302 --> 32:15.233
I'm a fashion beast.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.334
(Laughs)

32:16.335 --> 32:17.705
I'm funny, sometimes.

32:17.706 --> 32:19.067
Sure you are.

32:19.068 --> 32:20.009
So what is it?

32:20.010 --> 32:21.509
Is it my loud
socks, my big head?

32:21.510 --> 32:22.940
I'm... I'm too lanky?

32:22.941 --> 32:24.512
'Cause I'm thinking
about working out. I...

32:24.513 --> 32:26.074
Ethan, what are
you talking about?

32:26.075 --> 32:28.146
(Sighs)

32:28.147 --> 32:29.948
Why'd you pick Peter?

32:31.320 --> 32:34.722
Oh, Ethan.

32:34.723 --> 32:37.655
There's nothing wrong
with you. Not a thing.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.988
And if I led you on in any way,

32:39.989 --> 32:42.531
I am truly sorry.

32:45.995 --> 32:48.067
Are we still on for Sunday?

32:53.172 --> 32:55.004
I don't think so. Sorry.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.012
(Footsteps approach)

33:04.013 --> 33:05.153
What you got?

33:05.154 --> 33:08.016
Do you mind?

33:08.017 --> 33:09.987
Curtis.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.219
(Indistinct conversations)

33:11.220 --> 33:13.061
I thought I told
you to finish...

33:13.062 --> 33:14.522
They're a match...

33:14.523 --> 33:16.394
The hair from the earring
and Leonard's epithelials.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.126
Let me see that. (Clicks mouse)

33:18.127 --> 33:20.098
(Ethan) I wonder how
Leonard's going to explain

33:20.099 --> 33:21.429
his hair being on that earring.

33:21.430 --> 33:24.102
A father kills his own
daughter on her wedding day.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.104
Yeah, I didn't see that coming.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.475
Nice work.

33:27.476 --> 33:29.137
Ethan, call bud and Sam.

33:29.138 --> 33:31.679
Tell them we gotta stop
Leonard before he flies to Miami.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.311
Wait. Where is he?

33:33.312 --> 33:36.585
At his daughter's funeral.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.023
(People speaking indistinctly)

33:50.099 --> 33:53.030
Excuse me, detectives.
This is aprivateservice.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.032
(Peter) We're just here
to pay our respects.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.135
And to tie up some loose
ends with your husband.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.806
Oh, I think we've
cooperated enough.

33:58.807 --> 34:00.138
Now please leave.

34:00.139 --> 34:02.039
We can do this at
the station if you like.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.041
Look, it's been a
very difficult week.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.144
I'm sure you can understand.
Can this please wait?

34:06.145 --> 34:07.315
No, it can't.

34:07.316 --> 34:08.746
That is a beautiful flower.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.318
What is it?

34:10.319 --> 34:13.081
Lily of the valley. It
was Melissa's favorite.

34:13.082 --> 34:14.222
Oh.

34:14.223 --> 34:15.154
Dr. Hunt?

34:15.155 --> 34:16.824
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

34:16.825 --> 34:18.656
(Sam) You said that
you were in the room...

34:18.657 --> 34:21.129
(Lowered voice) Bud, let
me do the talking, okay?

34:21.130 --> 34:23.231
You haven't had the
lightest touch lately.

34:23.232 --> 34:25.163
Yeah, I'm beginning
to sound like you.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.135
(Normal voice) Mr. Waxman.

34:26.136 --> 34:27.295
Yes.

34:27.296 --> 34:29.737
We're very sorry for your loss

34:29.738 --> 34:31.439
and... and any pain that
we may have caused you.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.672
From what I've learned,
Melissa was a wonderful girl,

34:34.673 --> 34:38.206
and... and I think I speak
for both of us in saying that

34:38.207 --> 34:41.410
we will do everything we
can to find out who did this.

34:42.611 --> 34:44.112
Thank you.

34:44.113 --> 34:46.254
Good.

34:46.255 --> 34:47.685
(Curtis) The one on the left

34:47.686 --> 34:49.287
is the anther we found
under Melissa's fingernail.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.189
(Megan sighs) The one the right

34:51.190 --> 34:52.320
is from Lily of the valley.

34:52.321 --> 34:53.661
They're a match.

34:53.662 --> 34:55.092
How's the diet going?

34:55.093 --> 34:56.524
(Elevator bell
dings) Day to day.

34:56.525 --> 34:57.525
Try parenting.

34:57.526 --> 34:59.127
(Chuckles)

34:59.128 --> 35:01.469
Hey. You want to tell
us what's going on?

35:01.470 --> 35:03.201
After I saw

35:03.202 --> 35:05.203
the Lily of the valley
boutonniere on Marc, I went back

35:05.204 --> 35:07.535
to the trace evidence that
we found from Melissa's nails,

35:07.536 --> 35:10.208
which we had thought came
from her handling her bouquet.

35:10.209 --> 35:14.342
However, this is an anther
from the Lily of the valley flower,

35:14.343 --> 35:17.885
and Marc is the only
one in the wedding...

35:17.886 --> 35:19.687
Wearing that flower.

35:19.688 --> 35:21.689
That proves Marc was with
Melissa in the bridal suite

35:21.690 --> 35:23.291
before she died.

35:23.292 --> 35:24.392
Yes.

35:24.393 --> 35:26.254
Marc was wearing a
boutonniere in those photos,

35:26.255 --> 35:27.725
but he was not wearing
one the day I questioned him

35:27.726 --> 35:29.497
at the scene.

35:29.498 --> 35:31.399
You think the boutonniere's
in here, don't you?

35:31.400 --> 35:32.860
(People speaking indistinctly)

35:32.861 --> 35:34.363
(Laughs)

35:45.143 --> 35:47.345
Macadangdang.

35:47.346 --> 35:49.278
I found it.

36:01.390 --> 36:03.232
What is it?

36:08.337 --> 36:10.799
(Morris) What did you find?

36:12.701 --> 36:15.243
Blood. (Sighs)

36:15.244 --> 36:16.774
(Morris) Both Zack and Leonard

36:16.775 --> 36:19.507
went to Melissa to try to
convince her not to marry you,

36:19.508 --> 36:21.349
and they succeeded.

36:21.350 --> 36:24.712
She called your room. The
hotel operator confirms it.

36:24.713 --> 36:26.284
Your room's just down the hall.

36:26.285 --> 36:29.287
That's why you didn't show up
in the elevator surveillance video.

36:29.288 --> 36:30.918
Melissa tried to do
the honorable thing,

36:30.919 --> 36:33.261
and you just couldn't
handle it, could you?

36:33.262 --> 36:36.494
All those people...
So you lost it,

36:36.495 --> 36:38.226
and you shoved
her off the balcony.

36:38.227 --> 36:39.727
That's not true.

36:39.728 --> 36:41.399
We found a floral anther

36:41.400 --> 36:44.201
from your boutonniere
under Melissa's nail.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.673
Lily of the valley.

36:45.674 --> 36:48.205
Same one you're wearing now.

36:48.206 --> 36:52.310
I think that after
you pushed Melissa,

36:52.311 --> 36:56.314
she tried to stop her
fall by holding on to you.

36:56.315 --> 36:59.347
And all she got was
your stupid boutonniere.

36:59.348 --> 37:02.721
We found her blood
on the tip of the pin.

37:08.257 --> 37:11.228
(Sniffles)

37:11.229 --> 37:12.660
(Exhales)

37:12.661 --> 37:14.602
(Inhales deeply)

37:14.603 --> 37:18.366
It was an accident.

37:18.367 --> 37:19.667
I never meant to kill her.

37:19.668 --> 37:21.269
She...

37:21.270 --> 37:26.344
Yes, she tried to
call off the wedding...

37:26.345 --> 37:28.816
And I honestly didn't
know what to say.

37:28.817 --> 37:31.349
It was only when
she tried to hug me

37:31.350 --> 37:33.381
that I pushed her...

37:33.382 --> 37:37.655
Notto hurt her, just
to get away from her.

37:37.656 --> 37:41.859
I was so angry, the last thing
I wanted was to be hugged.

37:41.860 --> 37:42.960
(Sighs)

37:42.961 --> 37:45.433
(Sniffles)

37:45.434 --> 37:47.595
After she went over, I panicked.

37:47.596 --> 37:49.266
I put the chair
against the railing

37:49.267 --> 37:50.938
to make it look like
she had jumped...

37:50.939 --> 37:54.271
(Voice breaking)
And I went downstairs

37:54.272 --> 37:57.044
and blended in with
the wedding party.

37:57.045 --> 37:59.907
(Cries)

37:59.908 --> 38:02.880
That was supposed to be
the happiest day of my life.

38:02.881 --> 38:05.414
(Mutters and cries)

38:11.720 --> 38:13.361
(Beeps and whirs)

38:13.362 --> 38:14.323
(Peter) Ethan.

38:14.324 --> 38:16.364
(Sighs) Yeah.

38:16.365 --> 38:18.426
You want to tell
me what's going on?

38:18.427 --> 38:19.398
Really?

38:19.399 --> 38:20.568
Yeah.

38:20.569 --> 38:22.570
(People speaking indistinctly)

38:22.571 --> 38:24.372
I'm just wondering why,

38:24.373 --> 38:27.435
out of all the girls
you could date,

38:27.436 --> 38:29.607
you had to pick the
one girl that I like.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.308
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

38:31.309 --> 38:33.681
Wait a second.
You... you like Dani?

38:33.682 --> 38:35.743
Yes. I really like Dani.

38:35.744 --> 38:37.745
But you wouldn't notice
that 'cause you're out chasing

38:37.746 --> 38:39.347
half the tail in Philly.

38:39.348 --> 38:40.588
Oh, come on. You're
being ridiculous.

38:40.589 --> 38:41.989
Am I?

38:41.990 --> 38:43.352
(Beep)

38:45.424 --> 38:47.425
Just do me a favor.

38:47.426 --> 38:49.457
Don't break her heart
like you do all the others.

38:49.458 --> 38:51.328
Okay?

38:51.329 --> 38:54.332
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

38:57.636 --> 39:00.838
(Sighs deeply)

39:00.839 --> 39:02.940
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

39:02.941 --> 39:05.373
(Peter) Hey.

39:05.374 --> 39:07.745
I think I've seen enough
balconies for one week.

39:07.746 --> 39:10.117
I promise, I won't jump.

39:10.118 --> 39:12.049
You know, earlier
I got the feeling

39:12.050 --> 39:13.721
that you wanted to
tell me something,

39:13.722 --> 39:16.484
but you wouldn't
or couldn't or...

39:16.485 --> 39:18.686
Or shouldn't.

39:18.687 --> 39:20.528
Why is that?

39:20.529 --> 39:22.059
(Siren wailing)

39:22.060 --> 39:25.593
Because it goes against
everything we agreed upon.

39:25.594 --> 39:27.565
(Chuckles)

39:27.566 --> 39:29.366
I thought you were the girl

39:29.367 --> 39:31.739
who didn't want to be tied down.

39:31.740 --> 39:33.070
(Clicks tongue)

39:33.071 --> 39:34.802
I don't know what
I was thinking.

39:34.803 --> 39:36.804
(Ryan Adams'
"do I wait" playing)

39:36.805 --> 39:38.045

40:50.549 --> 40:52.680
Maybe you think that
I've been too hard on you,

40:52.681 --> 40:57.184
and I'm not giving you
the freedom that you want.

40:57.185 --> 41:00.057
I understand that.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.459
But something's
going on with you,

41:02.460 --> 41:06.464
and I can't help you if
you don't tell me what it is.

41:07.836 --> 41:10.738
Why do you want to
change the way you look?

41:10.739 --> 41:13.501
What's really going on?

41:13.502 --> 41:15.472
(Crying)

41:15.473 --> 41:18.847
I wasn't invited to
Tommy wirth's party.

41:20.509 --> 41:24.111
That's it?

41:24.112 --> 41:27.815
Mom, don't you understand?
I'm not one of the cool kids.

41:27.816 --> 41:31.589
Oh, pl... they don't
even know what cool is.

41:31.590 --> 41:32.720
(Continues crying)

41:32.721 --> 41:35.623
Lacey.

41:35.624 --> 41:37.625
Why didn't you tell me?

41:37.626 --> 41:40.668
Because cool isn't crying
to your mom about it.

41:40.669 --> 41:43.500
Oh, honey.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.173
Hey, I wasn't cool either.

41:46.174 --> 41:47.835
Look at me now.

41:47.836 --> 41:50.678
(Both laugh)

41:50.679 --> 41:52.710
Baby, you're you.
(Continues crying)

41:52.711 --> 41:56.243
Why would you want
to be anybody but you?

41:56.244 --> 41:58.686
I find you endlessly
fascinating.

41:58.687 --> 42:00.217
(Chuckles)

42:00.218 --> 42:01.649
(Laughs) I do,

42:01.650 --> 42:03.520
even though you
really look like a zebra.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.952
I don't even like this color.

42:04.953 --> 42:07.555
(Sniffles)

42:07.556 --> 42:09.727
I think you're gonna have to
take me to your hairdresser.

42:09.728 --> 42:11.228
Oh, I think you got that right.

42:11.229 --> 42:13.631
(Laughs)

42:13.632 --> 42:15.804
(Sniffles)
