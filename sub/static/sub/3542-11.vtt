00:02.240 --> 00:03.924
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.080 --> 00:06.606
- You took everything from me.
- Let bygones be bygones.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.531
- Resentment gets old.
- Know what never gets old? Revenge.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.842
- No.
- What's the matter? Missing something?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.287
I will kill you and everyone
you've ever met.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.647
Do that and you'll never see
your family again.

00:16.840 --> 00:20.686
<i>The spirits hate Klaus as much as we do,
using their powers to hide the coffins.</i>

00:20.880 --> 00:23.963
- Just won't open. I've tried everything.
- It's closed with a spell.

00:24.120 --> 00:27.203
He's been sired. He feels loyal to Klaus
because Klaus' blood created him.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.721
- I'm not giving Klaus anything.
- He'll kill Jeremy.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.246
Not really my problem.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.241
Jeremy, move!

00:34.200 --> 00:36.123
I have no idea
how you're on your feet...

00:36.280 --> 00:37.725
but I need to run tests.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.561
- I have some place I need to be, doctor...
- Fell.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.524
Your sister thinks we should talk.

00:43.720 --> 00:46.087
You're gonna leave Mystic Falls
and never think about it.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.965
If I thought I wouldn't
have to feel guilty anymore...

00:49.120 --> 00:51.805
- Guilty for what?
- For wanting what I want.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.328
You'll put a hole in that thing.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.601
- Wanna talk about it?
- Nothing to talk about.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.050
- Morning.
- You're late.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.806
We're supposed to meet Bonnie
at the witch house in 10 minutes.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.167
Relax.
You don't want your hair to fall out.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.089
Would you hurry?
We have work to do.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.006
You know, Klaus isn't gonna
spontaneously self-destruct.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.567
- Why are you all chipper?
- No reason.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.404
Be with you in a minute.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.442
So, what's got you all worked up?

01:45.640 --> 01:48.689
- I didn't really sleep last night.
- Yeah, me neither.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.649
Probably something to do with dying.
Heh.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.291
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:53.480 --> 01:58.042
I'm fine. I think the ring, however,
is running low on batteries.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.931
It's another reason why Jeremy
has to get out of town.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.402
If those rings have a shelf life,
he's not protected. Neither are you.

02:07.040 --> 02:11.090
- Nice. Nice, you're getting stronger.
- I'm just channeling frustration.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.561
I need coffee.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.524
I guess Damon's compulsion worked.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.007
Jeremy was packing
when I left the house.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.447
Going on about
his new school in Denver.

02:23.400 --> 02:27.291
Have you, uh, talked to Damon today?

02:28.000 --> 02:29.889
No. Why?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.211
No reason.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.969
Why won't you open?

03:06.760 --> 03:08.250
Hello?

03:12.280 --> 03:13.611
Is someone there?

03:18.120 --> 03:20.361
You didn't say anything to Elena, right?

03:20.520 --> 03:23.364
No, I said I wouldn't
- I know what you said.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.010
Then why are you asking?

03:25.200 --> 03:27.362
Protecting the location
of Klaus' family...

03:27.560 --> 03:31.804
is my number-one priority right now.
The fewer people who know, the better.

03:33.640 --> 03:34.721
What?

04:04.440 --> 04:07.603
These hybrids are really bringing
the neighborhood down.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.041
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.362
I, uh, got held up.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.642
It's okay. I just got here too.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.643
Can you pass me the balloons?

04:29.120 --> 04:30.565
Thanks.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.650
What got you running late?

04:32.800 --> 04:36.043
I, uh, was working on some new spells.
You?

04:36.240 --> 04:37.446
Working out with Alaric.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.166
So, uh, I have something
I need to tell you.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.447
- And you're not gonna like it.
- What happened?

04:51.800 --> 04:53.848
Jeremy's gonna be
leaving town for a while.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.361
He'll be staying
with family friends in Denver...

04:56.560 --> 04:58.289
until this Klaus thing blows over.

04:58.520 --> 05:01.922
Jeremy wouldn't just leave you
to deal with Klaus on your own.

05:02.920 --> 05:04.570
I know.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.891
I asked Damon to compel him.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.644
- You what?
- I know, Bonnie...

05:10.880 --> 05:13.486
but it's not safe for him here anymore.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.404
Leaving will give him a better life.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.601
The reason I'm telling you
is because I know...

05:18.800 --> 05:21.610
that you two haven't really
worked out your stuff.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.642
And I thought maybe
you'd wanna say goodbye.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.524
Wasting your time, it won't open.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.569
Did you bury the body?

05:41.760 --> 05:45.003
Yeah.
Any sign of our little hybrid buddies?

05:45.200 --> 05:46.645
Nope, just the dead one.

05:48.840 --> 05:52.640
All right, Klaus has six siblings.
Rebekah's now with Klaus.

05:52.800 --> 05:56.327
There was one dead kid in the old world,
one dead kid in the new world...

05:56.480 --> 05:58.960
which leaves Elijah and two others.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.964
Three sleeping originals, four coffins.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.010
- So who is in the lockbox?
- I have no idea.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.409
Whatever's in here, Bonnie seems
to think will help us kill Klaus.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.444
Sooner she can get this open,
sooner we know if she's right.

06:11.640 --> 06:15.122
You'd think if the spirits of dead witches
can make a coffin invisible...

06:15.280 --> 06:18.489
that they'd figure out
how to open one.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.765
Fine, don't help.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.247
You know none of this
is gonna do us any good...

06:24.440 --> 06:27.284
if Klaus' hybrid friends
find our hiding spot, right'?

06:27.440 --> 06:30.808
- They need to go away.
- Oh. Yeah, that's a great idea, Stefan.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.721
Why don't you ask him to pack a bag,
take a long vacation while you're at it?

06:34.880 --> 06:36.689
How about you keep the peace?

06:36.880 --> 06:39.360
Don't draw attention to things
we're trying to hide.

06:39.560 --> 06:43.406
I'm not gonna play defense
when I have what Klaus wants.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.803
He does what I say or I dump his family
to the bottom of the ocean.

06:46.960 --> 06:50.521
Then he kills you and everyone
you know. Like, I don't know, me.

06:50.760 --> 06:54.207
No, he's bluffing. His family means
more to him than anything else.

06:54.400 --> 06:58.007
- You sure about that?
- I don't know, Damon.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.562
I mean, I guess there's only one way
to find out, right?

07:01.760 --> 07:04.809
- Call his bluff.
- The only way to call someone's bluff...

07:04.960 --> 07:08.601
Stefan, is to be willing to lose
everything if you're wrong.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.891
Denver, huh?

07:21.280 --> 07:23.328
So were you going to say goodbye?

07:24.160 --> 07:25.764
I wasn't sure you cared.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.727
Of course I care.

07:28.920 --> 07:32.129
I was hurt by what happened between
you and Anna, Jeremy.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.482
I don't want you to leave town.

07:34.680 --> 07:38.765
I think this could be a good thing.
At least until this Klaus stuff blows over.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.325
I think I could have a better life there.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.443
That's what Elena said.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.811
It's exactly what she said.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.923
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.442
I'm just sorry you have to go.
That's all.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.848
- I can't talk to you.
- I know you're upset...

08:30.040 --> 08:33.249
Upset? You almost got Jeremy killed.

08:33.440 --> 08:37.525
And before you ask me to understand
or to support you...

08:37.720 --> 08:41.566
can you tell me what you're planning
to do about your sire bond to Klaus?

08:41.760 --> 08:43.683
There's nothing I can do, Caroline.

08:43.880 --> 08:46.008
That's the point.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.689
I just wanted you to know...

08:50.560 --> 08:53.211
that I understand
why you can't be with me.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.805
Even though I want to put you first,
before anyone...

08:59.640 --> 09:01.130
I can't.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.964
I'll never be able to.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.963
And I'm sorry.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.925
I'm so sorry.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.961
I just wanted you to know that.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.408
I'm sorry too.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.526
Happy birthday.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.521
Sweet dreams, Rebekah.

10:04.280 --> 10:07.284
- Show her to her room, would you, love?
- Sure.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.169
I'm surprised you're still in town.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.850
I gave you your freedom,
you could've gone anywhere.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.286
I live here, Klaus.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.527
Well, if we're playing this game,
then, uh, I was here first.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.570
You know, I don't like
your hybrid friends.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.570
They're everywhere.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.286
Kind of like fleas.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.363
I want them gone.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.807
Yeah, well, uh, I kind of like
having them around.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.085
Hmm.

10:45.600 --> 10:49.491
You know, I'm hurt.
I hoped that, uh, I'd free you...

10:49.640 --> 10:53.406
and we'd pick up where we left off.
But here you are...

10:53.600 --> 10:56.888
guzzling vervain like the rest of them,
I'm sure.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.089
So much for friendship.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.811
Friends don't strip friends
of their free will.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.689
Okay, granted, yeah,
that was a little extreme.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.001
I get a little moody.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.770
Just ask my siblings.

11:09.920 --> 11:13.720
Speaking of whom,
isn't it time you handed them over?

11:15.760 --> 11:16.841
Klaus...

11:19.360 --> 11:23.729
get your hybrids out of Mystic Falls
or I will remove them myself.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.446
Hmm.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.844
You see, if you continue to threaten me,
I'm gonna be forced to retaliate.

11:30.040 --> 11:33.647
Kill people. And it'll get messy again.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.885
Do whatever you want,
I don't really care.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.202
Or, you know what? Maybe I do.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.688
Yeah. Yeah, maybe I care so much...

11:42.880 --> 11:45.326
that I drop Elijah in the Arctic.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.647
Well, maybe I'd be willing to lose
one brother if it meant killing yours.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.969
Try me. Let's find out.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.571
Is everything okay?

11:59.760 --> 12:01.125
Everything's fine, Mindy.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.045
Stefan was just leaving
after failing to make his point.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.168
Well, one down.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.847
You may want to, uh, send the rest of them
away before it gets messy...

12:22.160 --> 12:23.207
again.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.690
Surprise!

12:42.320 --> 12:45.642
- Happy birthday.
- What are you guys doing here?

12:45.840 --> 12:49.686
Well, you blew off school and missed
our work of birthday art...

12:49.880 --> 12:54.363
so, uh, change into warmer clothes,
we're going to the falls.

12:54.520 --> 12:57.330
- S'mores, campfire.
- Cake.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.727
- Like when we were little.
- Except with tequila.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.411
Uh, thanks, guys, really, um...

13:04.600 --> 13:07.365
I'm just not really feeling
my birthday this year.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.085
I'm sorry. What?

13:09.280 --> 13:12.090
You already claimed your birthday
as everyone's favorite day.

13:12.280 --> 13:15.727
Yeah, and now it's just a reminder
that technically I'm dead.

13:15.880 --> 13:20.204
Look, I didn't even like 17.
The only point to 17 was to get to 18.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.121
It's a filler year.
I am stuck in a filler year.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.488
- You're not stuck, Caroline.
- Yeah, I am.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.411
But it's okay. You know, it's all good.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.364
I will be fine.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.682
But I just need some time
to wallow in it.

13:34.840 --> 13:38.242
Okay. Well, I think I have another idea.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.241
What do you want me to do
with her head?

13:43.400 --> 13:46.085
Just get rid of it, burn it.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.720
I honestly don't care, Daniel.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.044
You called? I'm here.

13:56.320 --> 13:57.401
What happened?

13:57.640 --> 14:01.167
Stefan had two paths in front of him.
He chose the one that made me angry.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.169
I need you to help me do something.

14:03.400 --> 14:07.086
- Can't you just leave me out of it?
- What would be the point in that'?

14:07.280 --> 14:10.170
Seriously, can't you get one of your
other hybrids to do your bidding?

14:10.760 --> 14:15.402
- I lost my friends, my girlfriend...
- Right, your, uh, girlfriend.

14:15.560 --> 14:19.121
Um, about her, I need you to bite her.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.362
- What?
- Don't make me repeat myself.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.962
- A hybrid bite would kill a vampire.
- I know exactly what it'll do.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.441
Uh, Stefan pushed me too far,
so I'm pushing back.

14:27.640 --> 14:31.565
- I'm not biting Caroline.
- Tyler.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.969
I've been supernaturally blessed with
the good fortune of a sire bond to you...

14:35.120 --> 14:38.727
so one could consider this me putting
your undying loyalty to the test.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.922
What the hell is wrong with you?

14:41.120 --> 14:43.407
I'm not hurting Caroline.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.562
All right. All right.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.922
I'm disappointed. But it's your choice,
free will and all that.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.726
I'll find another way to strike at Stefan.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.005
You can go now.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.485
- I thought Stefan saved your life.
- He did.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.564
He's willing to risk it to see
how far he can push Klaus?

15:07.760 --> 15:10.411
- Seems so.
- Well, is his humanity on or off?

15:10.560 --> 15:13.928
I'm thinking there's another option
at play. A bit of a dimmer switch.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.651
- Which is a huge problem.
- Why?

15:16.800 --> 15:20.521
I can't predict how far he's willing to go
until somebody gets killed.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.008
- Suddenly you care who lives or dies?
- I have a small list.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.683
- Talk about humanity dimmer switch.
- Screw you.

15:30.720 --> 15:34.281
Can't a Council meeting
ever just be a Council meeting?

15:35.840 --> 15:37.251
No? Okay.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.442
Oh. There it is.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.884
This is creepy.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.690
Even for us.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.490
No, Caroline was right.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.162
Technically, she's dead.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.567
Sorry. But you don't need a birthday.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.728
You need a funeral.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.882
You need to say goodbye
to your old life...

16:06.040 --> 16:08.566
so that you can move on
with your new one.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.325
Okay.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.411
Here lies Caroline Forbes.

16:21.560 --> 16:25.406
Cheerleader, Miss Mystic Falls...

16:25.560 --> 16:28.848
third grade hopscotch champion.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.005
Friend, daughter, over-achiever.

16:33.200 --> 16:38.604
- Mean girl, sometimes, no offense.
- Ha. None taken.

16:38.800 --> 16:44.045
She was 17 and she had a really
good life. So rest in peace...

16:44.240 --> 16:46.242
so that you can move forward.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.400
It's what you really need.
It's what we all really need.

16:53.120 --> 16:56.727
Amen, or cheers, or whatever.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.884
Bonnie?

17:08.960 --> 17:11.361
Nice. Okay, make a wish.

17:21.920 --> 17:25.527
This is the bridge where Elena and
Jeremy's parents died in a car accident.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.483
Something's up with her. Elena.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.251
Something more than usual.
Do you know what it is?

17:31.440 --> 17:34.284
Well, I'm sure it starts
with a "Stefâ€œ and ends in an "an."

17:36.320 --> 17:39.005
I'm gonna get a drink, write a check,
and then we're out.

17:51.920 --> 17:55.163
Alaric Saltzman, miracle patient.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.367
Dr. Fell.

17:56.520 --> 18:00.286
I'm glad you're alive. Half of me
thought you dropped dead in your sleep.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.960
Yeah, well, I guess I have nine lives. Heh.

18:03.120 --> 18:06.044
Not a bad thing to have
in a town with a vampire problem.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.326
I'm... I'm sorry.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.126
- Are you on the Founder's Council?
- I'm a Fell.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.847
I come from a long line of Founders.
May they rest in peace.

18:20.720 --> 18:25.442
I hate that bridge. My senior prom date
dumped me on this bridge.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.210
Yeah? Did you throw him over it?

18:27.360 --> 18:30.091
No, but I should've. I've been
holding a grudge ever since.

18:34.720 --> 18:38.725
Where'd your, um, friend go? I'm supposed
to hit him up for money for the fundraiser.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.086
You should, he's loaded.

18:40.240 --> 18:44.370
He's in good company. Some British guy
pledged to match every dollar we raise.

18:46.440 --> 18:47.885
What do you mean, British guy?

18:48.080 --> 18:51.209
You know, when I think of a mayor,
I think of an old fuddy-duddy.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.971
But you really have changed
my perception.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.731
- Thank you.
- What color are your eyes?

18:56.880 --> 19:00.930
They're blue.
- Look at what the cat dragged in.

19:01.080 --> 19:04.562
- Nice vest.
- Thank you. Good to see you, Damon.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.886
Uh, Carol and I were discussing if you
would be tonight's other big benefactor.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.686
What do you say?
Klaus has made a very generous pledge.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.446
You know how we're chomping at the bit
to begin the renovation.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.090
Hmm.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.767
Carol, don't take this the wrong way...

19:18.920 --> 19:22.891
but do you realize you've been kissing
the ass of an immortal hybrid...

19:23.040 --> 19:24.610
who ruined your son's life?

19:24.760 --> 19:28.731
Come now, some might say I saved it
what with that nasty full-moon business.

19:28.920 --> 19:32.447
I never had to go through it myself more
than twice, to be honest...

19:32.600 --> 19:35.524
but still, I'm very sympathetic.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.571
Klaus has promised
to protect Tyler, Damon.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.324
- And our town.
- From who?

19:42.560 --> 19:45.291
His hybrids are the ones
this town needs protection from.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.922
I'd have no use for them if your brother
would kindly return my family.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.451
Not gonna happen.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.291
Which is why I've come to an agreement
with the mayor.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.410
You and the Council stay out of my hair,
I'll stay out of yours.

19:56.560 --> 20:00.804
Your town gets protected, my hybrids
get left alone, everybody will be happy.

20:00.960 --> 20:05.045
All you have to do is to get Stefan
to stop decapitating my friends.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.611
Please, Damon, just get your brother
under control...

20:08.760 --> 20:11.286
or the Council will be forced
to take action.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.290
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Oh, come on, mate.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.642
Give peace a chance.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.570
- Give me.
Ah-ah.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.643
I need it more than you do. Trust me.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.647
- Caroline, what are you doing?
- Huh? Hmm? Nothing.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.643
- Huh?
- Hmm?

20:36.720 --> 20:41.851
Okay, you're a bad sober liar,
you're an even worse drunk liar.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.811
- I might have texted Tyler.
- Caroline.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.246
What? I'm delicate.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.086
Give her a break. You can't control what
everyone does all the time.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.489
- Wow.
- Ouch, Bon.

20:56.640 --> 21:01.123
I'm sorry. I know it's Caroline's birthday,
funeral or whatever...

21:01.360 --> 21:05.206
but I just feel it's really wrong that
you compelled Jeremy to leave town.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.931
I'm doing it to protect him, Bonnie.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.566
I wanna give him a chance
at a halfway normal life.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.087
He should be able to choose
how he wants to live.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.969
You're taking his choices away.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.443
- Bonnie, you can't tell him.
- Why?

21:18.600 --> 21:19.965
You gonna compel me not to?

21:20.120 --> 21:23.363
You know, you guys are ruining
a perfectly good funeral.

21:26.920 --> 21:27.967
I'm sorry.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.885
I'm just gonna go sleep it off
or something.

21:31.280 --> 21:32.361
Happy birthday.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.844
The mayor's looking out for Tyler.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.367
We have to assume
Klaus has her in his pocket.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.569
Oh, please don't tell me
you're gonna drink the Klaus Kool-Aid.

21:45.720 --> 21:47.882
I'm not gonna let him
hold this town hostage.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.283
I'm also not gonna let innocent people
get caught in the crossfire...

21:51.440 --> 21:54.171
of a pissing contest between
a hybrid and a vampire.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.765
Liz, I'm impressed.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.764
- You're all strong and sheriff-y.
- I'm not kidding, Damon.

21:58.960 --> 22:02.169
Get Stefan to stand down from this one
before someone gets hurt.

22:03.680 --> 22:06.365
What are you doing?
You're gonna ruin your career.

22:06.520 --> 22:08.568
Says the guy
who got his job from his dad.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.888
You have any idea
what you're messing with?

22:11.040 --> 22:13.168
- I know what I'm doing.
- Damn it, Meredith...

22:13.320 --> 22:15.607
- Back off, Brian.
- Whoa, hey.

22:17.320 --> 22:18.651
Everything all right here?

22:18.800 --> 22:20.802
- Everything's fine.
- Didn't look fine.

22:24.040 --> 22:27.408
You might wanna get to know her
before you become her white knight.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.365
She's kind of a psycho case.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.410
You're that guy, aren't you?

22:33.560 --> 22:36.245
The one begging
to have his teeth kicked in.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.086
Take it from me, man.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.281
Life's too short.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.363
Just go away, Brian.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.125
Behold, my senior prom date.

22:52.320 --> 22:55.164
You definitely should've
thrown him over the bridge.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.681
Unfortunately,
I have to work with him.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.081
He's on the Council,
a medical examiner.

23:02.240 --> 23:05.483
The guy who signs his name
animal attack.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.847
- I get it.
- Yeah.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.204
Duty calls.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.370
Thanks for the hero moment.

23:18.720 --> 23:19.801
Anytime.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.443
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

23:58.600 --> 24:00.523
No dead hybrids
at the Founder's party.

24:00.680 --> 24:04.048
I told Klaus to get hybrids out,
he didn't listen, I'm saying it louder.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.965
You don't think there's more
where that came from?

24:07.120 --> 24:10.363
If you kill them, Klaus won't make more?
Have you forgotten Elena?

24:10.520 --> 24:13.364
Do you not care if she's
a blood bag the rest of her life'?

24:13.520 --> 24:15.284
Protecting Elena
is your problem how.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.204
I'm not compelled by Klaus to do it.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.728
Don't give me that "no humanity" crap.
You can't just ï¬‚ip your switch.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.121
Your switch is fried,
just like your brain.

24:23.280 --> 24:26.966
You wanna take Klaus? You wanna
beat the villain? You gotta be smarter.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.485
No, to beat the villain...

24:28.640 --> 24:30.563
you have to be the better villain.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.167
Sorry

24:47.320 --> 24:49.482
- I didn't mean to crash the party.
- So don't.

24:50.400 --> 24:54.121
No, it's, uh... It's okay. Hi.

24:54.840 --> 24:56.444
Can I talk to you for a sec?

24:57.080 --> 24:58.241
It's kind of important.

25:08.160 --> 25:11.084
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.481
I want her to be happy, you know?

25:16.840 --> 25:19.605
It's what I want for all of you,
in the middle of this...

25:19.760 --> 25:22.331
crazy life you got stuck living.

25:22.480 --> 25:25.643
Is that how you see it?
That we're stuck?

25:25.800 --> 25:29.122
I'd say it's attached itself
to all of you pretty tight, yeah.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.691
But Bonnie's right, you know?

25:36.840 --> 25:39.491
I have no business
messing in Jeremy's head.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.008
I just didn't know what else to do.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.809
He's in danger here.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.608
I can't lose anyone else that I love.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.405
I take it all back.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.250
Everything I said this morning.

26:01.400 --> 26:05.325
Klaus can't control me.
Not when it comes to you.

26:05.800 --> 26:06.847
I won't let him.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.168
Tyler, it's okay.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.322
Maybe we just weren't meant
to be together.

26:11.480 --> 26:15.166
Maybe we just have to
accept that and move on.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.162
I'm not moving on from anything.

26:21.640 --> 26:22.846
I love you.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.405
What?

26:45.840 --> 26:47.524
Ouch. What the hell?

26:47.680 --> 26:49.523
<i>Ow.</i>

26:53.080 --> 26:54.764
What just happened?

26:55.360 --> 26:57.567
- Oh, no.
- Did you...?

26:57.760 --> 26:59.967
- Did you just bite me?
- Oh, my God.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.083
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.641
Oh, no. Caroline?

27:04.800 --> 27:06.370
- Oh, my God.
- Caroline, just...

27:06.560 --> 27:07.800
Just get away from me!

27:07.960 --> 27:09.883
Get away from me!

27:11.920 --> 27:13.684
Caroline!

27:16.320 --> 27:19.085
Great. We've been abandoned.

27:19.280 --> 27:22.887
We're going on a search party. I don't
trust that she won't get back with him.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.804
- Caroline!
- Come on, Caroline.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.803
We don't have any more drinks.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.884
And Matt's being haunted
by the Fell ghosts. Woo!

27:42.880 --> 27:44.325
What are you doing, Stefan?

27:50.240 --> 27:52.641
Hello, Damon.
She's a little busy right now.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.280
- You have Elena's phone?
- Making my next move.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.887
Let me ask you something.
What will Klaus do...

27:58.040 --> 28:00.281
- ...if he can't make any more hybrids?
- What?

28:00.440 --> 28:01.930
Stefan, leave her out of this.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.201
What are you doing?

28:07.360 --> 28:09.044
Stefan, let me out of this car.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.771
Do you hear me?
Let me out of the car.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.124
What now?
You just pulled me away...

28:18.280 --> 28:21.602
from a fascinating conversation
about landscaping the town square.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.290
Stefan just grabbed Elena.

28:23.480 --> 28:27.041
- Well, he's getting desperate.
- He's gonna try and use her against you.

28:27.200 --> 28:30.283
- Do what he says. Get rid of your hybrids.
- Or what?

28:30.520 --> 28:32.363
Stefan would never dream
of killing her.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.803
He tried to behead someone
in the middle of a Council party.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.962
He's operating on crazy right now.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.324
Well, crazy or not,
that kind of love never dies.

28:45.240 --> 28:48.130
- He's bluffing.
- Maybe he is. Maybe he isn't.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.726
But if you don't want to believe him,
believe me.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.769
I know my brother better than anyone.

28:52.920 --> 28:55.127
I don't have a clue
how far he'll take this...

28:55.280 --> 28:58.648
<i>so if he says "blink,"
I suggest you blink.</i>

29:00.120 --> 29:01.963
Sheriff Forbes!

29:02.480 --> 29:03.845
What happened?

29:04.040 --> 29:06.088
- Tyler bit her.
- Oh, my God.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.242
Sweetheart. Careful, careful.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.970
Oh, honey.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.642
Caroline, honey, can you hear me?

29:13.800 --> 29:15.450
I'm sorry, Mommy.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.809
She's been hallucinating.
No one's picking up their phone.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.689
It's all right, sweetheart.

29:24.560 --> 29:28.201
So, what's the plan, Stefan?
What's the big move you're making?

29:28.360 --> 29:30.328
I took Klaus' family
to make him suffer.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.130
I won't let him make a new one.

29:32.280 --> 29:34.442
So then what are you gonna do, huh?

29:34.680 --> 29:37.570
Are you gonna lock me in some cave
and keep me hostage?

29:39.160 --> 29:41.128
Maybe I'll just turn you
into a vampire.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.090
Stop the car, Stefan.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.327
Stop the car, Stefan!

29:55.680 --> 29:57.523
Stefan, how nice to hear your voice.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.489
Tell your hybrids to get out of town.

29:59.640 --> 30:02.405
Well, that's not gonna happen
until I get my coffins back.

30:02.600 --> 30:06.685
Okay. Well, I'm gonna drive
your blood source off Wickery Bridge.

30:06.840 --> 30:09.207
I don't believe you, Stefan.
You won't kill her.

30:16.600 --> 30:17.726
What are you doing?

30:17.880 --> 30:19.041
What's going on?

30:19.200 --> 30:22.090
I just fed her my blood.
No more hybrids if she's a vampire.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.083
<i>- You won't do it.
- Really? Try me.</i>

30:24.240 --> 30:26.004
Because your coffins are next to go.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.129
Say goodbye to your family, Klaus.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.125
Stefan, slow down.

30:34.320 --> 30:35.890
Stefan! Stefan, stop it!

30:36.040 --> 30:37.769
Fine. I'll send them away. You win.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.081
Stefan!

30:41.240 --> 30:42.366
Stefan, stop!

30:42.520 --> 30:43.760
Stop the car, Stefan.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.167
Get back in the car.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.766
- Stay away from me.
- Elena, get in the car.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.450
How could you?

31:15.880 --> 31:20.522
My parents died
going over this bridge. I almost died.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.282
You knew that.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.084
You're the one who saved me.

31:26.080 --> 31:29.084
He had to believe I would do it, all right?
Your fear sold it.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.009
- What if he hadn't?
- He did.

31:31.200 --> 31:34.170
- Well, what if he hadn't?
- He did, Elena! He backed down!

31:34.320 --> 31:37.802
He has a weakness. If I know
his weakness, I can destroy him.

31:39.600 --> 31:42.570
After everything?
That's what mattered?

31:44.240 --> 31:46.402
Destroying Klaus?

31:50.480 --> 31:52.369
Destroying Klaus is all I have left.

31:53.720 --> 31:54.801
You had me.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.928
I lost you the minute
I left town with him.

31:59.600 --> 32:02.251
You just haven't let yourself
admit that yet.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.441
Is that what you're doing?

32:06.840 --> 32:08.604
Trying to make me hate you?

32:12.520 --> 32:15.729
I don't really care what you think
about me anymore, Elena.

32:42.760 --> 32:43.807
Tyler came to see me.

32:43.960 --> 32:47.760
Poor boy seemed quite distressed.
He said Caroline had a terrible accident.

32:47.920 --> 32:50.127
You made him do this to her.

32:50.320 --> 32:52.004
He wouldn't do something like this.

32:52.160 --> 32:54.083
I'm here to help, Matt.

32:55.360 --> 32:58.762
My blood will heal her. Please,
ask the sheriff to invite me inside.

32:58.920 --> 33:00.888
I know how this game works.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.605
You want something in return.

33:04.320 --> 33:05.401
Just your support.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.406
Come in.

33:25.520 --> 33:26.806
Are you going to kill me?

33:26.960 --> 33:29.008
On your birthday?

33:30.280 --> 33:31.884
You really think that low of me?

33:33.640 --> 33:34.687
Yes.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.330
That looks bad.

33:49.480 --> 33:52.131
My apologies. You're what's known
as collateral damage.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.520
It's nothing personal.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.645
I love birthdays.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.570
Yeah.

34:07.720 --> 34:11.360
Aren't you, like, a billion or something?

34:11.520 --> 34:14.842
You have to adjust your perception
of time when you become a vampire.

34:15.000 --> 34:19.801
Celebrate the fact that you're no longer
bound by trivial human conventions.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.166
You're free.

34:22.639 --> 34:24.290
No.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.929
I'm dying.

34:35.840 --> 34:39.161
And I could let you. Die.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.444
If that's what you want.

34:42.000 --> 34:47.166
If you really believe your existence
has no meaning.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.800
I thought about it myself...

34:52.719 --> 34:56.007
once or twice, over the centuries...

34:56.159 --> 34:58.322
truth be told.

35:01.520 --> 35:04.444
But I'll let you in on a little secret.

35:04.920 --> 35:10.529
There's a whole world out there
waiting for you.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.930
Great cities and art...

35:14.080 --> 35:15.923
and music.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.764
Genuine beauty.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.641
And you can have all of it.

35:31.080 --> 35:34.084
You can have
a thousand more birthdays.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.202
All you have to do is ask.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.407
I don't want to die.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.044
There you go, sweetheart.

36:01.600 --> 36:02.806
Have at it.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.444
Happy birthday, Caroline.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.610
- Thanks for picking me up.
- Anytime.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.285
You gonna be okay?

36:24.440 --> 36:26.124
I'll survive.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.362
Somehow, I always do.

36:28.880 --> 36:31.167
You know,
Stefan won this round for us, today.

36:31.800 --> 36:35.361
He pushed Klaus to the edge,
and Klaus blinked.

36:38.120 --> 36:41.408
- Well, his method sucked.
- Still. We needed it.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.928
Klaus has been calling all the shots.
Stefan beat him at his own game.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.765
- He was the better villain.
- Don't sound so impressed.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.446
Well, can't help but be a little proud.

36:51.280 --> 36:52.930
Really, tell me.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.361
You gonna be okay?

37:03.880 --> 37:05.803
You can't kiss me again.

37:06.360 --> 37:08.169
I know.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.245
I can't.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.411
It's not right.

37:17.520 --> 37:21.525
It's right. Just not right now.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.487
Good night.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.004
Good night, Damon.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.249
Ah. You're gonna have to
let me go eventually.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.889
Be safe, okay?

37:53.080 --> 37:55.321
Yeah, okay. All right.

37:55.480 --> 37:56.811
Look, Alaric's waiting.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.290
Good.

38:02.440 --> 38:03.805
You haven't left yet.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.530
Hey, what are you doing here?

38:11.000 --> 38:12.445
I came to say goodbye.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.041
You're not gonna jump, are you?

39:37.120 --> 39:38.963
Thanks for coming.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.928
I was just thinking about
what you said.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.208
About us being stuck.

39:45.400 --> 39:49.405
I was buzzed, Elena. I can't be
held responsible for being judgmental.

39:49.560 --> 39:52.006
I do feel stuck, Matt.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.604
I feel like...

39:55.280 --> 39:58.170
I'm holding onto the girl
who was supposed to die here...

39:58.320 --> 39:59.731
with her parents.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.202
The girl that had a normal life...

40:03.360 --> 40:06.011
and didn't fall in love
with vampires.

40:08.720 --> 40:11.041
You're not that girl anymore.

40:12.680 --> 40:15.160
It's okay if you want to let her go.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.730
Is it?

40:17.880 --> 40:19.405
Because I feel like I've...

40:19.600 --> 40:22.365
I've disappointed her a little. Like...

40:23.960 --> 40:26.088
Like I've disappointed them.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.650
My parents.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.889
My two cents...

40:36.920 --> 40:39.685
as a guy who knew that other girl...

40:41.240 --> 40:43.368
you're doing a lot better
than you think.

40:52.960 --> 40:55.122
Here lies Elena Gilbert.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.288
A fun girlfriend...

40:59.200 --> 41:01.328
and an amazing friend.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.280
Thank God. Another day-drinker.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.446
I lost a patient. What's your excuse?

41:19.600 --> 41:22.683
Uh, well, I put a kid on a plane.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.604
- Yours?
- No, it's...

41:26.440 --> 41:28.090
a long story.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.571
Oh.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.121
Then you should probably
buy me a beer.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.051
A hiker called it in.
My guys got here first.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.845
Another hybrid?

41:43.000 --> 41:47.324
That's what I thought at first.
Brian Walters. The medical examiner.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.722
What's up with the stake?
He's not a vampire.

41:51.880 --> 41:54.724
I know. This was a murder.
