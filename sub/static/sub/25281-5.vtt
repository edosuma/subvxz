00:07.758 --> 00:09.260
Many years ago there was...

00:09.301 --> 00:12.471
a little girl and a little boy.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.516
They lived in a small village in Mexico

00:15.558 --> 00:17.893
and they were best friends.

00:17.935 --> 00:20.260
One day the little girl's parents

00:20.302 --> 00:23.023
were killed in a terrible accident.

00:23.065 --> 00:24.734
Pop.

00:24.775 --> 00:25.943
Pop, pop, pop.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.943
Without her parents,

00:27.985 --> 00:29.385
the little girl didn't
have anywhere to live.

00:30.285 --> 00:34.243
So the little boy's parents
took her in to live with them

00:34.285 --> 00:36.286
in their castle high on a hill.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.331
Every night before they went to sleep,

00:39.373 --> 00:41.876
the little girl and
the little boy prayed together.

00:42.443 --> 00:46.585
But the little girl was still
very sad about her parents,

00:46.627 --> 00:50.367
and scared to live in the
big castle with her new family.

00:51.048 --> 00:52.243
So the little boy

00:52.268 --> 00:54.353
gave her one of his favorite toys

00:54.395 --> 00:56.498
to make her feel better.

00:56.974 --> 00:59.518
This made the little girl feel
much better.

00:59.560 --> 01:04.063
But one day, a very mean boy
stole the toy from her

01:04.105 --> 01:06.692
and laughed at her when she got upset.

01:08.570 --> 01:12.991
So the little boy sneaked up
on the mean boy

01:13.032 --> 01:15.743
and snatched the toy from him...

01:19.747 --> 01:21.416
...and returned the toy
to the little girl.

01:21.457 --> 01:25.420
She felt safe and protected
by the little boy.

01:25.461 --> 01:28.256
When the little girl was older,

01:28.298 --> 01:31.408
she decided it was time
to leave the big castle

01:31.449 --> 01:33.553
and move to the United States.

01:36.055 --> 01:37.432
And she brought the toy with her

01:37.473 --> 01:39.892
so she would always remember
the little boy.

01:44.856 --> 01:48.109
To this day,
the toy still comforts her...

01:48.151 --> 01:51.446
every night before she sleeps.

02:21.392 --> 02:23.519
Okay.

02:24.771 --> 02:26.356
Jesus... fuck. What are you...

02:26.397 --> 02:27.899
doing here?

02:27.940 --> 02:30.401
I thought you might
need a towel or something.

02:32.390 --> 02:34.768
For what, my ankles?

02:36.240 --> 02:38.868
What are you still...

02:38.910 --> 02:40.203
Are you...

02:40.244 --> 02:42.152
Are you expecting a tip?

02:42.193 --> 02:43.576
Is that what's happening here?

02:43.618 --> 02:45.375
You want a... because... you...

02:45.416 --> 02:47.951
Okay. Well, man, you got balls,
I'll tell you that.

02:47.993 --> 02:50.296
I'm sure I got something in here for you.

02:50.338 --> 02:55.134
Oh, shoot, I left all
my cash in my other pants.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.806
Well, this is a complete
waste of my time.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.557
Just give it five minutes.

03:01.599 --> 03:03.851
I think you're trying to play me.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.151
Goddamn it. He-He's gonna be here.

03:07.192 --> 03:08.564
Just give him five minutes, all right?

03:08.606 --> 03:11.150
Same old McBride bullshit.

03:11.192 --> 03:14.195
Same old bullshit.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.072
Look, this cat's gonna tell you

03:16.114 --> 03:18.574
Julio's not the killer.

03:18.616 --> 03:19.992
You know this case is over,

03:20.034 --> 03:22.995
so you're saying you're desperate.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.123
There's got to be something we can do.

04:07.165 --> 04:10.418
I mean, if we lose our witness,
you're all we got.

04:10.460 --> 04:13.463
It's complicated. Okay?

04:13.504 --> 04:17.175
The Tito Garcia thing is part
of a much bigger investigation

04:17.216 --> 04:19.051
that I can't talk about.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.642
- Oh, come on, Jeff, don't spin this.
- Look, there are

04:21.684 --> 04:23.765
a lot of players involved now.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.267
The La Mano Cartel?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.127
You know I can't say that.

04:31.606 --> 04:33.649
I know this is not your top priority,

04:33.691 --> 04:34.734
but it is ours.

04:34.776 --> 04:36.360
I guarantee you,

04:36.402 --> 04:39.238
our witness is part
of your bigger investigation.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.411
Okay, look,

04:45.894 --> 04:48.247
we're investigating Tito's deportation.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.833
All right? If I come across
something that can help you...

04:50.875 --> 04:52.084
Then help us.

04:55.404 --> 04:57.072
I'll see what I can do.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.510
I'm not making any promises.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.429
All right.

05:04.079 --> 05:05.681
Appreciate it.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.004
Fine.

05:15.757 --> 05:17.360
Fine.

05:18.682 --> 05:19.888
You coming?

05:19.929 --> 05:21.572
Yeah, I'm coming.

05:25.475 --> 05:27.203
Thank you.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.631
We get a lot of weird stuff in the mail.

05:33.672 --> 05:35.503
People send baked goods, but trust me,

05:35.545 --> 05:36.963
don't eat anything
that comes in the mail.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.256
Don't eat the mail, got it.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.591
Can you work a phone?

05:40.633 --> 05:42.343
Is that a trick question?

05:42.385 --> 05:45.346
A lot of volunteers your age
have never used a landline.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.473
If you have any questions,
I'm right over there.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.641
Great, thank you.

05:48.683 --> 05:50.000
You're welcome.

05:58.341 --> 05:59.694
Hi.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.320
- May I help you?
- I'm here to see

06:01.362 --> 06:02.446
Marisol Silva?

06:02.488 --> 06:04.675
Yes, um, of course.

06:04.717 --> 06:05.992
D-Do you have an appointment?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.326
Do I need an appointment?

06:07.368 --> 06:09.495
I think so. Yes, um...

06:09.537 --> 06:10.580
What's your name?

06:10.621 --> 06:12.831
Miguel Torres, from the...

06:13.523 --> 06:15.975
- Miguel...
- ...Disabled Veterans Association.

06:16.017 --> 06:17.461
Um...

06:17.503 --> 06:19.130
Just... okay, yeah, l-let me...

06:19.171 --> 06:20.860
One second. Sorry.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.966
No. You need to make an appointment.

06:27.008 --> 06:29.140
I-I'm here to speak with you.

06:29.181 --> 06:30.391
The only way you're gonna speak with me

06:30.433 --> 06:31.767
is through the proper channels.

06:32.375 --> 06:33.561
My boss says

06:33.603 --> 06:34.937
I'm to speak to you today.

06:34.979 --> 06:36.439
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.984
Make an appointment... next time.

06:46.157 --> 06:47.538
Sorry about that.

06:47.580 --> 06:48.665
No, I'm so sorry.

06:48.707 --> 06:49.952
Did I handle that wrong, or...?

06:49.994 --> 06:51.505
No, that was perfect.

06:51.547 --> 06:53.146
Thank you, Denise.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.836
Okay.

06:58.878 --> 07:00.630
Who was that guy?

07:00.671 --> 07:03.341
Uh, he said he was from the
Disabled Veterans Association.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.926
Are you sure?

07:04.967 --> 07:07.386
That's what he said.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.709
It was so embarrassing.

07:38.751 --> 07:40.586
Oh...

07:40.628 --> 07:42.797
So, what do you even say to a kid

07:42.838 --> 07:44.090
who tells you something like that?

07:44.131 --> 07:45.383
I know, I know.

07:45.424 --> 07:46.634
I just sort of didn't.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.721
Yeah, I hear you.

07:50.763 --> 07:52.431
Unless you got kids, you just can't know,

07:52.473 --> 07:53.724
you know what I mean?

07:53.766 --> 07:55.393
- Oh, yeah. No, I know.
- Hey.

07:55.434 --> 07:58.646
- I know... hi.
- Hey. What's going on?

07:58.688 --> 08:00.690
I told Mary you were running
late, so we've just been

08:00.731 --> 08:01.732
having a little chat here, and...

08:01.774 --> 08:03.192
Yeah.

08:03.234 --> 08:05.175
Sorry, I-I should've called.

08:05.217 --> 08:06.570
It's okay.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.572
Well, Keith and I
are on working this case.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.616
I-Innocent kid, wrong place, wrong time,

08:10.658 --> 08:12.576
and all that, and we got a guy.

08:12.618 --> 08:15.621
If he'd come forward, he could
prove the kid's innocent, but...

08:15.663 --> 08:17.498
Come on, Billy.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.750
Don't need to bother Mary with all that.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.585
- I'm just curious what she thinks.
- She probably

08:21.627 --> 08:22.965
doesn't care.

08:22.990 --> 08:24.717
I'm sure she's got an opinion.

08:24.758 --> 08:26.215
I mean, what do you think?

08:26.257 --> 08:28.884
Honestly, I mean,
should the guy come forward,

08:28.926 --> 08:31.465
and... even though he'd have to admit

08:31.506 --> 08:33.736
- that he did something wrong?
- Kid's innocent?

08:33.779 --> 08:36.392
Yeah, I mean, that seems like
what a decent person should do.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.741
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Problem is,

08:38.783 --> 08:40.479
we're not sure he's a decent person.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.356
He may just be a scumbag, so...

08:42.398 --> 08:43.857
What do you think, Keith?

08:44.507 --> 08:46.195
I think we should talk outside.

08:46.237 --> 08:47.361
Yeah.

08:47.403 --> 08:49.363
Yeah, we don't want
to bore Mary with all this.

08:49.405 --> 08:50.781
We'll see you later, honey.

08:50.823 --> 08:52.909
Okay. Oh...

08:52.951 --> 08:55.179
I hope that guy does the right thing.

08:55.221 --> 08:56.305
Yeah, me, too.

08:56.347 --> 08:57.461
Say bye.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.290
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye.

09:11.409 --> 09:12.928
Fuck do you think you're doing, huh?

09:12.970 --> 09:14.305
Just trying to give you
one more chance...

09:14.346 --> 09:16.140
Just stay the fuck away from me.

09:16.182 --> 09:18.517
Okay? Stay the fuck away from my family.

09:19.708 --> 09:21.269
You know what I could do to you.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.523
Whatever it is, it ain't gonna
make your problem go away.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.945
I'm trying to help you and your family.

09:25.987 --> 09:27.163
Fuck you.

09:27.205 --> 09:28.637
You don't give a fuck about me.

09:28.678 --> 09:30.237
Let's say that's true.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.823
It ain't your wife's fault,
and it ain't your kids' fault.

09:33.473 --> 09:36.198
Do not use my family to get to me, okay?

09:36.240 --> 09:37.293
I know that fucking trick.

09:37.335 --> 09:38.770
This ain't a trick.

09:41.231 --> 09:43.735
Listen, all this is
gonna come back on you.

09:43.777 --> 09:45.461
I got the FBI all over it.

09:46.653 --> 09:49.340
You need to tell me what
you want to do, right now.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.392
I fucked up, man.

10:02.812 --> 10:05.231
I ruined our lives.

10:08.484 --> 10:10.260
I need your help, Bill.

10:11.428 --> 10:12.738
Yeah, I know.

10:13.054 --> 10:14.889
And that's what I'm trying to do.

10:16.641 --> 10:18.494
So let's go get in the car
and see Hakeem,

10:18.536 --> 10:20.311
- all right?
- No.

10:21.372 --> 10:22.748
I don't, I don't think I can

10:22.790 --> 10:24.166
look him in the eye
and tell him this shit.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.293
You're gonna have to, man.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.660
You should probably leave your gun here.

11:06.858 --> 11:08.627
Oh, shit, there it is.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.046
What? Caviar for you, Pringles for me?

11:11.088 --> 11:12.798
All right, you know what?

11:12.840 --> 11:15.634
You just shut your mouth,
you take this bite,

11:15.676 --> 11:17.383
it'll change your life right now.

11:17.425 --> 11:18.828
Here it comes.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.807
Oh, my God.

11:22.832 --> 11:24.351
Aw, that's awesome.

11:24.393 --> 11:26.071
Mm-hmm, that's Jean-Georges right there.

11:26.112 --> 11:28.076
There's more where that came from.

11:28.118 --> 11:28.981
Oh.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.235
- Here you go, my friend.
- Thank you.

11:35.136 --> 11:37.990
Wolf it down, sister.

11:39.682 --> 11:41.410
Look at you.

11:41.452 --> 11:43.761
- Look at you on this boat.
- You know,

11:44.569 --> 11:47.917
I think all this looks
pretty fucking good on me.

11:47.958 --> 11:50.169
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

11:50.211 --> 11:51.713
Tell you what, Brittany.

11:51.755 --> 11:52.741
What?

11:54.340 --> 11:55.799
I think everything looks good on you.

11:56.407 --> 11:57.843
So, there.

12:10.356 --> 12:13.442
Oh, fuck.

12:15.740 --> 12:17.283
Oh...

12:21.617 --> 12:23.619
I'm not, like, uh...

12:26.271 --> 12:30.251
I can't, like, regular people, um...

12:30.292 --> 12:34.880
It doesn't work that way for me, um...

12:36.423 --> 12:39.051
It's complicated, so I'm not, uh...

12:39.993 --> 12:42.012
Well, I got my own
complicated past, so...

12:42.054 --> 12:45.140
- Not like mine.
- No, I get it.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.726
I don't know.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.396
You don't scare me. I've seen it all.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.299
Done it all.

13:00.155 --> 13:02.724
Can I show you something?

13:12.221 --> 13:13.860
McBride's a piece of work.

13:15.778 --> 13:18.156
I mean, we don't have to talk.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.395
The fuck is this?

13:31.437 --> 13:33.772
He'll tell you.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.243
I need a guarantee.

13:47.757 --> 13:49.233
Witness protection.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.415
Immunity.

13:51.457 --> 13:53.149
You're the guy?

13:53.954 --> 13:56.248
I need your word or I'm not saying shit.

13:56.273 --> 13:58.233
Look, he's not gonna do anything

13:58.258 --> 14:00.865
for you, Roman, unless you
tell him what you told me.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.304
I, uh...

14:07.931 --> 14:11.602
Julio Suarez...
did not kill Hunter Friedman

14:11.643 --> 14:12.853
and Marcos Peña.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.316
Tito Garcia was my C.I.

14:17.358 --> 14:19.300
He killed those boys.

14:20.301 --> 14:21.779
Tito told you that?

14:21.820 --> 14:24.114
- No.
- Then how do you know?

14:24.156 --> 14:26.825
That's all I'm telling you
till my family is safe

14:26.867 --> 14:29.203
and I have immunity.

14:33.356 --> 14:35.334
- What'd you do?
- I'm not telling you a thing.

14:35.376 --> 14:36.377
- What the fuck did you do?
- No,

14:36.418 --> 14:37.836
that-that's all I'm saying now.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.275
- You plant that fuckin' gun?
- That's all...

14:39.316 --> 14:41.090
No, no. Come on. Come on.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.256
Hakeem, buddy, come on, come on, come on.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.301
- He set the kid up.
- I know, I know, I know.

14:44.343 --> 14:45.803
I prosecuted an innocent fucking kid.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.221
- Yes, I know that.
- Not to mention every case

14:47.262 --> 14:48.931
- that we worked on can be thrown out.
- He's helping us now,

14:48.972 --> 14:50.374
- okay?
- What the fuck were you thinking?

14:50.416 --> 14:52.055
Please.

14:52.096 --> 14:54.019
No, I'm not giving him any fucking help.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.354
Need you to tell me everything
I need to fucking know.

14:55.396 --> 14:56.355
No fucking way.

14:56.397 --> 14:57.773
- No?
- No.

14:57.815 --> 14:59.745
Oh, you think you're calling
the shots right now?

14:59.787 --> 15:02.236
There's more to it.

15:05.656 --> 15:07.574
You guys know everything?

15:07.616 --> 15:09.410
We know what we need to know.

15:09.934 --> 15:13.747
But you're gonna have to get his
family witness protection. Okay?

15:13.789 --> 15:15.148
And immunity.

15:15.732 --> 15:17.584
You need to tell me every
goddamn thing I need to know.

15:18.114 --> 15:19.519
Everything.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.088
Okay.

15:21.130 --> 15:23.173
I'm gonna get my wife
and kids out of town,

15:23.215 --> 15:24.988
- and then I'll tell you everything.
- No, no.

15:25.030 --> 15:26.289
- No, I can't let you do that.
- Come on.

15:26.290 --> 15:27.922
- I'm gonna put a cop on you.
- Hakeem, you know me, all right?

15:27.947 --> 15:29.325
- No.
- I'm not gonna put my family at risk.

15:29.367 --> 15:30.472
- I...
- I'm gonna put a cop on you.

15:30.514 --> 15:32.516
You got me, man.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.545
Okay.

15:38.564 --> 15:40.232
Just make it someone
I don't know already.

15:40.274 --> 15:41.525
Hey, Hakeem.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.446
He's your boy now, give him a ride home.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.739
Get in the fucking car.

15:57.693 --> 15:59.793
Good luck, Detective.

16:11.597 --> 16:14.456
So, it all started, uh, with my sister.

16:14.481 --> 16:15.667
Mm-hmm.

16:15.709 --> 16:18.687
When she was 12, she lost her leg.

16:18.729 --> 16:22.065
And, uh... it was like a staph infection.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.925
And, um...

16:24.818 --> 16:26.528
Sorry, I feel like...

16:26.570 --> 16:28.572
- Huh?
- I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

16:28.614 --> 16:30.122
Really? It's okay.

16:30.164 --> 16:32.034
Hey, it's okay.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.702
Keep going.

16:35.787 --> 16:40.209
Anyway, um... the... the first morning

16:40.250 --> 16:42.252
that my sister was home
from the hospital,

16:42.294 --> 16:44.630
at breakfast, my mom was trying to,

16:44.671 --> 16:48.383
you know, just keep it light
with cartoons and cereal.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.385
You know, like we're...

16:50.427 --> 16:53.305
It's a normal... normal morning,

16:53.347 --> 16:54.765
normal kitchen.

17:07.653 --> 17:10.512
This is the table. Um...

17:11.406 --> 17:15.953
I... My sister sat in her wheelchair.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.288
She had her prosthetic on.

17:18.329 --> 17:21.040
But it was bothering her, so my mother

17:21.083 --> 17:23.085
helped her take it off here at the table.

17:23.126 --> 17:28.507
And... I was nine, and I sat right here

17:28.549 --> 17:32.553
watching it all. And, uh...

17:32.952 --> 17:35.806
her knee was, uh...

17:38.058 --> 17:39.893
I just couldn't take my eyes off of it.

17:39.918 --> 17:42.896
It was red, and...

17:42.938 --> 17:45.399
it's where her leg was cut off.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.924
Oh.

17:47.901 --> 17:51.113
Anyway, it was sore,
so my mother was rubbing it

17:51.154 --> 17:52.948
to soothe her.

17:52.990 --> 17:58.495
And... I... realized that

17:58.537 --> 18:02.958
she was going to exclusively
have my mother's love

18:03.000 --> 18:05.276
from that point, um...

18:06.486 --> 18:09.506
which, strangely...

18:12.676 --> 18:15.429
I mean, I don't know,
I was a fucking kid.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.347
I didn't know what a hard-on was,

18:17.389 --> 18:19.516
but that's what happened.

18:19.558 --> 18:24.187
Um, and my therapist later reduced it

18:24.229 --> 18:27.608
to something called
eroticized childhood trauma,

18:27.649 --> 18:29.383
which, uh,

18:30.635 --> 18:32.863
is just like, uh...

18:34.865 --> 18:38.619
Well... I'm so fucked up. You know?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.037
And, uh...

18:41.705 --> 18:42.869
But it happened.

18:44.631 --> 18:47.294
I don't know what I'm...

18:47.336 --> 18:49.153
So, you built this?

18:50.947 --> 18:54.635
That therapist said I really needed to

18:55.159 --> 18:57.554
imagine myself in my childhood kitchen,

18:57.596 --> 19:01.415
really put myself... here.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.416
I guess if you have the money, right?

19:05.965 --> 19:07.773
Why not, huh?

19:07.814 --> 19:11.068
Yeah. I don't know.
It's-it's over the top.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.653
It's a lot. I don't...

19:17.115 --> 19:18.516
Can I?

19:20.017 --> 19:21.495
Come on, I don't want you to... You...

19:21.536 --> 19:23.622
- I want to.
- Don't-don't make fun of me.

19:24.438 --> 19:26.416
I want to.

19:28.943 --> 19:30.629
Okay.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.957
The right?

20:08.458 --> 20:10.502
The left.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.120
Like that?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.558
Yeah.

21:02.846 --> 21:05.724
I've never been intimate
with anyone before.

21:06.457 --> 21:08.852
I've been in relationships

21:08.894 --> 21:12.189
and had sex and...

21:12.230 --> 21:14.399
But never...

21:16.926 --> 21:19.011
Is it weird that I'm...

21:20.030 --> 21:24.743
thinking about us being together?

21:27.871 --> 21:29.539
No.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.442
I like helping you.

21:34.503 --> 21:36.546
- You do?
- Yeah.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.924
Why?

21:39.573 --> 21:43.303
Because... I understand you.

21:46.747 --> 21:49.017
Do you understand me?

21:52.420 --> 21:54.231
I think I do.

22:00.261 --> 22:02.072
Come down here.

22:04.241 --> 22:05.575
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my God.

22:05.617 --> 22:08.286
Not... no...

22:08.328 --> 22:09.663
Stop.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.581
Hey, do you want to sleep over?

22:11.623 --> 22:14.501
I can't tonight.

22:14.775 --> 22:16.711
But soon.

22:16.986 --> 22:18.964
- Hmm?
- Okay.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.800
I got to go back to the office.

22:21.842 --> 22:23.635
Prep some final paperwork for Billy.

22:23.677 --> 22:25.679
Yeah? What's final? What's going on?

22:25.720 --> 22:29.373
I don't know, I guess he thinks
Julio's gonna get out next week?

22:30.392 --> 22:32.561
Wha-What happened?

22:33.043 --> 22:35.689
Uh, Billy found a guy
who's willing to testify

22:35.730 --> 22:37.173
about the murders.

22:37.983 --> 22:40.301
So, he's-he's got somebody
who's gonna flip?

22:41.385 --> 22:44.739
It always happens on cases
like this with Billy.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.825
He just digs and digs and digs

22:46.867 --> 22:50.328
and keeps, I don't know,
asking people questions.

22:50.370 --> 22:54.249
And... eventually...

22:54.291 --> 22:57.460
someone comes forward
and tells the truth.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.240
Well, that's-that's awesome.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.993
Yeah, but it's a mess of paperwork.

23:08.496 --> 23:10.247
Did I bring a purse?

23:21.693 --> 23:22.652
Billy.

23:22.694 --> 23:26.072
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:28.867 --> 23:30.327
How's it going?

23:30.368 --> 23:33.622
It's good. Good. I...

23:34.230 --> 23:36.082
I was worried about you.

23:36.607 --> 23:38.460
Well, you shouldn't be
worried about my ass.

23:38.501 --> 23:40.545
I mean, I should've called you, and I...

23:40.587 --> 23:43.089
I'm a fucking idiot. I'm really sorry.

23:43.131 --> 23:44.841
I was just thinking
you didn't trust me enough

23:44.883 --> 23:46.593
- to talk to me.
- No, I do trust you.

23:46.635 --> 23:48.929
- Really. I wanted to also...
- Well, maybe you shouldn't.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.513
...apologize, you know...

23:50.555 --> 23:52.349
You don't need to apologize
to any... Forget it.

23:52.390 --> 23:54.059
You didn't say anything, it was me.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.311
The whole fucking thing was me.
I was an asshole.

23:56.353 --> 23:59.564
And the fact that you
came down here surprises me.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.817
Why are you not mad at me?
I don't understand.

24:02.859 --> 24:06.947
Well, I was worried. I wasn't mad.

24:24.798 --> 24:26.800
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:30.387 --> 24:33.306
What's going on?
I, uh, I can't go inside?

24:33.348 --> 24:35.225
- No.
- No more, uh, Uncle Danny?

24:35.266 --> 24:36.768
Mary's feeling like shit, you know.

24:36.810 --> 24:37.978
Kids are coming down with something.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.146
- Oh, that sucks.
- Yeah.

24:41.505 --> 24:43.817
Thought I was gonna see you
at the game today.

24:43.858 --> 24:46.695
What, were you afraid
I was still gonna own you,

24:46.736 --> 24:48.238
even with the bum knee?

24:48.279 --> 24:50.782
- In your dreams, buddy.
- Yeah.

24:52.784 --> 24:58.123
So, um, the pickup, the locker...
everything cool?

24:58.522 --> 25:00.356
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

25:00.398 --> 25:02.377
- Yeah, all good.
- Oh.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.005
All right.

25:05.821 --> 25:06.965
I don't know.

25:07.007 --> 25:08.800
I'm feeling like shit, too.
I think I'm coming down with it.

25:08.842 --> 25:11.261
Oh. Anything I can do?

25:11.302 --> 25:12.995
No.

25:13.972 --> 25:16.224
You'd tell me if there was, right?

25:16.665 --> 25:18.083
Yeah.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.396
Yeah, I'm sure I'll be fine
in a couple days.

25:21.438 --> 25:23.339
Yeah, yeah.

25:25.066 --> 25:27.777
- All right, be better, man.
- Okay.

25:44.544 --> 25:48.182
- Hey. You-you look beautiful.
- No. Sit down.

25:48.224 --> 25:51.551
Sit down. This is gonna take a second.

25:51.593 --> 25:55.805
I'm gonna try to break this
down for you. Okay.

25:55.847 --> 25:58.799
First of all, I want
to preface this by saying that

25:58.841 --> 26:01.686
I-I really do think
you're a very brave man.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.938
- Thank you.
- That being said,

26:03.980 --> 26:08.276
uh, hypothetically, this
is gonna go great. All right?

26:08.318 --> 26:10.987
You're tall and you're nice,
and you can't figure me out,

26:11.029 --> 26:13.114
which you find interesting for now.

26:13.156 --> 26:16.030
So, so we go out a couple times, right?

26:16.072 --> 26:17.410
And that goes well.

26:17.452 --> 26:19.454
It goes so well, in fact,
that we sleep together.

26:20.187 --> 26:23.249
That goes extremely well
because you are, in fact,

26:23.291 --> 26:26.986
tall and nice and I am
extraordinary in bed.

26:29.736 --> 26:31.132
I'm very serious. I'm extraordinary.

26:31.174 --> 26:33.051
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:33.093 --> 26:34.928
So we do that a couple of times,

26:34.969 --> 26:37.138
and you're still interested,
I start getting comfortable,

26:37.180 --> 26:39.594
so I give you a set of keys. Right?

26:39.636 --> 26:41.224
You leave a toothbrush at my place.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.521
And then we start getting
into a routine. All right?

26:44.562 --> 26:48.233
And this is what that clown show

26:48.274 --> 26:50.606
is gonna look like, okay?

26:50.647 --> 26:53.071
I'm gonna come home from work, late.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.614
So you've already eaten.

26:54.656 --> 26:57.158
So I have a quick salad
and I jump in the shower.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.452
I double cleanse my face.
I do my business in there,

26:59.494 --> 27:01.871
then I hop out, and then it's,
uh, toner, serum, oil,

27:01.913 --> 27:05.500
eye cream, and I coat it all
with hyaluronic acid.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.889
Then I put eyelash grower on my eyebrows

27:07.931 --> 27:09.381
because I was starting
to look like a chola,

27:09.423 --> 27:11.289
and I was trying to fill them in,

27:11.331 --> 27:12.799
but you can't really tell
'cause I have blonde tips,

27:12.841 --> 27:14.592
but it's happening.
I'm terrified of getting old.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.151
Then I put on my self-tanner.

27:16.192 --> 27:18.638
Okay? Then I put on my jam-jams.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.181
Very important because, at first,

27:20.223 --> 27:23.268
I'll only wear my jam-jams.
Okay? It's a comfort thing.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.436
Then I'm gonna start wearing your shorts.

27:26.211 --> 27:29.440
I'm gonna wear your shorts.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.298
- That's not funny.
- Mm-hmm.

27:31.340 --> 27:32.980
I'm gonna put on my humidifier,

27:33.022 --> 27:34.696
my air purifier, and the television.

27:34.737 --> 27:37.282
It's gonna be set to a channel
that you fucking hate.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.450
Then I'm gonna hop into bed, all right?

27:39.492 --> 27:41.077
Now, this is where,

27:41.119 --> 27:44.146
this is where the real fun
begins, all right?

27:44.706 --> 27:46.583
This is when the Vicks comes out.

27:46.624 --> 27:49.485
I put that shit on my feet.

27:50.268 --> 27:51.853
I put it on my chest.

27:51.963 --> 27:54.716
I put it under my nose
and I put it on my sinuses.

27:54.757 --> 27:56.342
All right?

27:56.384 --> 27:58.052
I guarantee you,

27:58.094 --> 28:01.121
I guarantee you,
that if you stick around...

28:02.432 --> 28:04.851
you're gonna smell like Vicks
for the rest of your life.

28:05.459 --> 28:08.563
- Mm.
- For the rest of your life.

28:08.605 --> 28:11.482
Okay? It will never get out
of your clothes.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.818
It will never leave you.

28:13.860 --> 28:14.819
Hmm.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.237
How do I know this?

28:16.279 --> 28:18.013
Because I have been married twice,

28:18.781 --> 28:20.474
and they both stink.

28:21.492 --> 28:22.893
Okay?

28:24.871 --> 28:27.332
So that's... that's pr...

28:27.373 --> 28:30.043
Oh, shit, last thing: Invisalign.

28:30.084 --> 28:32.170
Oh, for my fucked up teeth.
Is it genetic?

28:32.212 --> 28:34.005
Who knows? My birth parents gave me up

28:34.047 --> 28:35.924
and I grew up in foster care.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.675
Um... so that's another bag of trash

28:37.717 --> 28:38.927
that I carry around with me

28:38.968 --> 28:40.887
that will eventually become your problem.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.723
Hey, you want to dance?

28:47.518 --> 28:49.312
I... Absolutely not.

28:49.670 --> 28:51.648
Come on, just one dance.

28:56.194 --> 28:57.719
Just one.

28:58.196 --> 29:00.365
If I do it, will you leave me alone?

29:00.406 --> 29:01.930
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

29:01.971 --> 29:02.992
Yes, okay.

29:03.034 --> 29:04.786
You will leave me alone
if I dance with you?

29:04.827 --> 29:07.330
One dance, please.

29:12.126 --> 29:14.504
Fine.

29:27.016 --> 29:29.477
No. That's so stupid.

29:29.519 --> 29:32.188
- That's such a stupid thing to do.
- No, it's great.

30:16.691 --> 30:18.901
So no question about credibility?

30:18.943 --> 30:20.385
No.

30:21.237 --> 30:22.864
Well, Mr. McBride, it looks like

30:22.905 --> 30:24.115
you have all the evidence you need.

30:24.157 --> 30:25.491
I have to draft the immunity letter

30:25.533 --> 30:28.060
and, uh, get the witness'
statement on record.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.413
We have a motion

30:30.455 --> 30:31.956
to dismiss the charges here.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.958
Can you get that through
today, you think?

30:35.442 --> 30:37.323
Mr. Rashad, are you prepared?

30:37.364 --> 30:39.676
- No, I'm sorry, I'm not.
- Well, we'd like to tell him,

30:39.718 --> 30:40.927
so when do you think you will be?

30:40.969 --> 30:42.675
Well, as long as everything
checks out with the witnesses,

30:42.717 --> 30:44.927
I should be done by,
I don't know, Monday.

30:46.203 --> 30:47.889
Okay, well,

30:47.930 --> 30:50.475
let's have the motion to dismiss
on the books by Monday morning.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.769
Can we at least get him
in protective custody

30:52.810 --> 30:54.604
over the weekend?

30:54.645 --> 30:56.672
- That works for me.
- Cool.

31:01.027 --> 31:03.363
- Mr. McBride.
- Yeah?

31:03.404 --> 31:05.990
Mr. Rashad and I are going
to take care of everything,

31:06.032 --> 31:07.658
but, uh...

31:07.700 --> 31:09.869
I just want you to know that

31:09.911 --> 31:13.164
you've really done your job
and your client is going home

31:13.206 --> 31:15.500
and I want to thank you

31:15.541 --> 31:19.212
for not letting this court
send an innocent kid to prison.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.299
Thank you.

31:30.681 --> 31:32.266
- Hey.
- What's up, bud?

31:32.308 --> 31:33.559
How you doing?

31:35.561 --> 31:37.713
They put me in a P.C. unit.

31:38.689 --> 31:40.691
- They said you ordered it.
- Yeah.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.985
- That's right.
- Why do I have to be in there?

31:43.027 --> 31:44.695
It's like solitary confinement.

31:44.737 --> 31:47.448
It's only for a couple of days,
and there's good reason for it.

31:48.682 --> 31:50.201
So then I can get out of there?

31:50.243 --> 31:52.199
I can go back to my old cell?

31:52.241 --> 31:54.271
No, then you get to leave.

31:56.565 --> 31:58.517
What do you, what do you mean?

31:58.559 --> 32:00.628
They're dropping the charges against you.

32:03.673 --> 32:05.091
Are you serious?

32:05.133 --> 32:07.468
Come Monday, you're gonna be a happy boy.

32:07.510 --> 32:10.054
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.014
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Oh.

32:12.056 --> 32:13.975
No, I'd hug you, I just
don't like doing that.

32:16.269 --> 32:18.521
Oh, my...

32:27.429 --> 32:29.389
I'm open!

32:30.700 --> 32:32.827
Oh!

32:32.869 --> 32:34.245
I made it!

32:34.287 --> 32:36.873
Can't believe I made that.
I suck at basketball.

32:36.914 --> 32:38.940
Oh, shit.

32:40.293 --> 32:41.878
How's the knee?

32:41.919 --> 32:44.046
- It's good. It's fine.
- All right, sorry about that.

32:44.088 --> 32:45.756
That got out of hand. I won't...

32:45.798 --> 32:47.300
I won't let that happen again, okay?

32:47.341 --> 32:48.509
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

32:48.551 --> 32:49.802
What's up?

32:49.844 --> 32:52.221
Uh, not much, just checking in
on you. You all right?

32:52.263 --> 32:54.056
Fine.

32:54.098 --> 32:55.808
Who do you think it is?

32:56.958 --> 32:58.311
Um...

32:58.352 --> 33:00.062
What do you mean?

33:00.504 --> 33:02.527
Danny, I'm not, I'm not wearing a wire.

33:02.569 --> 33:04.591
There's nobody here.
You don't have to be secretive.

33:05.401 --> 33:08.529
- Who do you think it is?
- Who-who do I think what is?

33:08.571 --> 33:09.739
Come on, Danny.
I don't want to joke around.

33:09.780 --> 33:12.033
- I don't want you...
- I...

33:12.074 --> 33:13.892
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

33:13.934 --> 33:16.913
- Do you really not know?
- I really don't know.

33:19.707 --> 33:23.669
Billy McBride has someone
who's going to flip.

33:25.821 --> 33:28.174
Wait, what? Wh...

33:28.216 --> 33:29.699
Where'd you hear that?

33:31.427 --> 33:33.012
Danny, how do you not know this?

33:33.054 --> 33:35.223
I-I-I haven't,
I haven't heard that, I mean...

33:35.264 --> 33:38.250
O-Okay, well, now you know.
So, who do you think it is?

33:39.393 --> 33:42.355
I-I don't know. Uh... Marisol?

33:42.396 --> 33:44.023
Mar... Why Marisol?

33:44.065 --> 33:46.234
Well... I mean, isn't... she's...

33:46.275 --> 33:47.735
- been hanging out?
- She's not making

33:47.777 --> 33:49.487
those kind of moves without us. Right?

33:49.529 --> 33:51.489
I'm thinking about, you know,
maybe one of your friends,

33:51.531 --> 33:52.740
some people you've been trying
to stay close to.

33:52.782 --> 33:54.033
One of my friends? What, like Roman? No.

33:54.075 --> 33:56.953
- It is, it is not Keith Roman.
- But how do you know?

33:56.994 --> 33:58.663
- I mean, look, he's your friend...
- I'm just...

33:58.704 --> 33:59.872
...you're close with him,

33:59.914 --> 34:01.791
but you said he's been stressed
out, maybe there's a...

34:01.832 --> 34:03.793
Yeah, yeah, ab-about
his wife and his kids,

34:03.834 --> 34:05.419
but, I mean, not about this shit.

34:08.047 --> 34:10.341
This is getting serious.

34:11.074 --> 34:12.552
Do you understand?

34:12.592 --> 34:16.429
- Yeah, I understand.
- But do you really?

34:16.472 --> 34:18.849
- Yes, I understand.
- Okay.

34:19.708 --> 34:23.396
- So, if it's not Roman...
- Yeah.

34:23.795 --> 34:26.399
...then who is it? I mean, is...

34:26.440 --> 34:27.817
is it me?

34:29.551 --> 34:31.404
- Okay, that's funny.
- It is funny.

34:31.445 --> 34:33.138
And maybe it's you.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.242
Yeah, it's me. It's me. I'm sorry.

34:36.600 --> 34:37.868
That's not funny.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.495
Wh-Wh-Whoa!

34:40.020 --> 34:41.539
I'm kidding. I'm not gonna
do that to you anymore.

34:41.581 --> 34:44.625
- Let's figure it out, okay?
- Yeah.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.177
I've made it a priority as mayor

34:55.219 --> 34:57.805
and will continue to push policies

34:57.847 --> 35:00.766
that will address the opioid crisis.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.776
I'm Joe from Hacienda Heights,

35:10.818 --> 35:13.154
and my question
is for Councilwoman Silva.

35:13.195 --> 35:15.740
You've talked a lot about
building an inclusive community

35:15.781 --> 35:17.241
through your outreach programs.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.986
Even with your poll numbers dropping,

35:19.608 --> 35:22.121
you are very public
in supporting a murderer

35:22.163 --> 35:24.957
from one of those programs.
Are you concerned that

35:24.999 --> 35:26.505
may undermine even your base

35:26.530 --> 35:28.276
this close to the election?

35:30.004 --> 35:32.256
Joe, thank you
for your question, and, um,

35:32.298 --> 35:34.550
just to clarify, Julio Suarez

35:34.592 --> 35:37.428
has been accused of murder.

35:37.911 --> 35:40.556
I stand by his innocence
because in this country

35:40.598 --> 35:43.309
you're innocent until proven otherwise.

35:50.858 --> 35:54.940
But, Joe, I don't blame you
for your choice of words.

35:54.982 --> 35:58.574
Mayor Anderson also neglects
to include the word "accused"

35:58.616 --> 36:01.059
when it comes to my support of Julio.

36:01.869 --> 36:05.873
You know, Julio grew up
in tough circumstances.

36:05.915 --> 36:07.917
He could have just easily
slipped through the cracks

36:07.958 --> 36:10.044
and become a victim of the system.

36:10.610 --> 36:13.839
Instead, he's an honor student

36:13.881 --> 36:16.157
and a talented musician.

36:16.759 --> 36:21.430
As many of you know, I was born
in a small village in Mexico.

36:21.472 --> 36:25.434
And my parents died
when I was very young.

36:25.476 --> 36:28.354
And though I was fortunate
to come to this country,

36:28.396 --> 36:31.725
I was poor and I didn't
speak the language.

36:31.767 --> 36:32.972
So I, too,

36:33.014 --> 36:35.528
could have just easily
slipped through cracks.

36:35.570 --> 36:39.990
As mayor, I want to become
the voice that unites all of us,

36:40.032 --> 36:42.201
no matter what the circumstances.

36:42.243 --> 36:45.287
This is the Los Angeles I know and love.

36:45.329 --> 36:47.123
And this is the Los Angeles

36:47.164 --> 36:51.001
I will proudly represent as your mayor.

37:00.344 --> 37:01.887
Oh, thank you.

37:10.646 --> 37:13.190
- How do you know this?
- Well, I followed your lead,

37:13.232 --> 37:14.817
I inserted myself into Billy's camp,

37:14.859 --> 37:17.677
I got to know one of his employees.

37:18.028 --> 37:20.990
I'm not sure who's flipping,
but I think we're...

37:21.031 --> 37:24.118
extremely close to being exposed.

37:30.458 --> 37:33.002
- Jesus...
- I just want you to have

37:33.043 --> 37:35.004
the information, but...

37:35.528 --> 37:39.908
I would still love to support
you standing by Julio,

37:40.992 --> 37:43.328
but our options are...

37:45.622 --> 37:46.748
limited.

37:49.709 --> 37:52.462
- Tom, what if I just quit?
- Marisol.

37:56.435 --> 37:57.860
It's time.

38:11.499 --> 38:13.042
Hello?

38:13.083 --> 38:14.502
Who's this?

38:14.543 --> 38:16.504
Elena Morales.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.702
Marisol Silva's
campaign manager. Who's this?

38:18.744 --> 38:21.801
Oh, it's very nice to meet you,
Elena. I'm Gabriel.

38:21.842 --> 38:23.636
Would you mind giving Marisol
a message from me?

38:24.285 --> 38:25.638
Okay.

38:25.679 --> 38:28.599
Ask her when's the last time she prayed?

38:28.641 --> 38:29.975
Can you remember that?

38:30.017 --> 38:32.019
I'm sorry. Who is this?

38:32.061 --> 38:33.896
Hello?

38:35.898 --> 38:38.067
Hey.

38:38.633 --> 38:40.194
Do we have any new numbers yet?

38:40.236 --> 38:43.072
Everyone has you winning
the debate by a landslide.

38:43.113 --> 38:44.949
Instant polls already have you up by ten.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.450
Fantastic.

38:46.891 --> 38:48.285
I'm exhausted.

38:48.327 --> 38:49.995
Who's Gabriel?

38:54.023 --> 38:55.626
Uh...

38:55.668 --> 38:57.628
He wanted me to give you a message.

38:57.670 --> 39:00.089
Uh, "When's the last time you prayed?"

39:01.239 --> 39:03.133
What does that mean?

39:08.413 --> 39:10.832
You ask a lot of questions, Elena.

39:11.875 --> 39:14.103
I'm just trying to keep you safe.

39:14.627 --> 39:16.522
You're very good at your job,

39:16.564 --> 39:19.233
but I think it's time for you to move on.

39:21.551 --> 39:23.028
You're firing me?

39:23.070 --> 39:24.822
No. Never.

39:24.864 --> 39:28.075
I'm giving you the freedom
to explore a new opportunity.

39:31.186 --> 39:34.248
Elena, the campaign is over.

39:35.190 --> 39:36.917
Senator Briggs from your hometown

39:36.959 --> 39:40.348
inquired about your service
a while ago, but at the time,

39:40.389 --> 39:41.630
I didn't want to let you go

39:41.672 --> 39:44.633
because you're such a valuable asset.

39:44.675 --> 39:48.178
But he's very impressed with
what you've done for me so far.

39:48.220 --> 39:50.955
I don't want to go back to Sacramento.

39:52.457 --> 39:57.187
I'm calling him and giving you
my highest recommendations.

39:57.229 --> 40:00.149
This is best for both of us.

40:02.750 --> 40:03.922
Good luck.

40:09.617 --> 40:11.827
I wish you the best.

40:16.815 --> 40:19.126
Anyways, Marisol's
really brave, you know?

40:19.168 --> 40:21.462
I mean, this guy came in today
who had a hook for a hand.

40:21.503 --> 40:22.755
No shit.

40:22.796 --> 40:24.757
- Yeah, it's crazy, right?
- Yeah.

40:24.798 --> 40:26.175
It was pretty weird.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.886
Marisol just walked right up to him

40:29.619 --> 40:31.388
and told him he needed
to make an appointment,

40:31.430 --> 40:34.892
but he kept insisting
and being really pushy with her

40:34.934 --> 40:36.894
and she stood her ground, though.

40:36.936 --> 40:38.086
Sent him on his way.

40:39.963 --> 40:42.691
Did you ever find out
what he wanted or who he was?

40:42.733 --> 40:45.464
- Uh-uh.
- Like a street person or something?

40:45.505 --> 40:48.364
- He said he was a disabled veteran.
- Oh.

40:48.405 --> 40:50.991
Those guys go through
a lot of shit, you know.

40:51.033 --> 40:55.162
He could've had... you know,
some kind of PTSD or whatever.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.913
Marisol was brave, though.

40:59.732 --> 41:01.168
If it were me, I probably would have

41:01.210 --> 41:02.544
just hidden in my office.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.714
I really like her.

41:05.756 --> 41:07.407
You do?

41:08.575 --> 41:10.469
- I think you made that clear.
- Mm-hmm.

41:10.511 --> 41:12.638
- About 300 times.
- Okay.

41:13.538 --> 41:15.557
You just seem really happy is all.

41:18.668 --> 41:20.270
I'm all right, I guess.

41:32.116 --> 41:33.742
Thank you, Luis.

41:33.784 --> 41:36.453
Of course, Ms. Silva, any time.

41:37.061 --> 41:38.706
Did Mr. McBride tell you?

41:38.747 --> 41:41.750
Yes. They're dropping the charges.

41:42.150 --> 41:45.671
I'm so happy.

41:45.987 --> 41:49.216
My girlfriend's gonna throw
this really big party.

41:49.782 --> 41:51.260
And I'd really like you to come.

41:51.301 --> 41:53.262
Of course, of course.

41:53.303 --> 41:54.746
I'll be there.

42:03.087 --> 42:05.423
You didn't deserve any...

42:07.091 --> 42:09.302
you didn't deserve any of this.

42:10.553 --> 42:13.323
Well, it's all going to be over soon.

42:15.743 --> 42:20.581
Look, thank you so much
for believing in me.

42:22.982 --> 42:24.752
I'll never forget it.

42:28.655 --> 42:30.758
I love you.

42:30.799 --> 42:32.968
I love you, too.

43:20.856 --> 43:21.999
Okay, Keith.

43:22.792 --> 43:24.144
Tell me.

43:24.186 --> 43:25.562
I can't.

43:25.604 --> 43:26.897
You owe me an explanation.

43:26.939 --> 43:28.357
I-I don't want you to get involved.

43:28.398 --> 43:30.567
Oh, yeah? I am fucking involved.

43:30.609 --> 43:32.152
We're all fucking involved.

43:32.194 --> 43:36.698
Look, all I can say is,
Danny came to me...

43:36.740 --> 43:38.450
- Yeah?
- ...with this thing.

43:38.492 --> 43:39.743
- What thing?
- Okay?

43:39.785 --> 43:41.703
- And-and-and it got out of hand.
- What?

43:41.745 --> 43:44.414
Do not touch me!

43:47.900 --> 43:50.337
- I could kill him.
- No.

43:50.379 --> 43:51.713
Where is he? I'll kill him.

43:51.755 --> 43:53.423
I need to own it.

43:58.053 --> 44:01.765
I did not sign up for this, Keith.

44:02.331 --> 44:04.309
I don't deserve this.

44:04.351 --> 44:06.228
Your kids don't deserve this.

44:06.270 --> 44:08.272
I know.

44:35.073 --> 44:37.509
What's gonna happen to Danny?

44:54.943 --> 44:56.945
Danny?

44:58.488 --> 45:00.449
It's him.

45:00.490 --> 45:02.451
It's fucking him.

45:02.492 --> 45:04.685
Well, Danny, you better take care of it.

45:07.021 --> 45:08.749
Wait, what?

45:08.790 --> 45:10.292
He's my-my fucking best friend, man.

45:10.334 --> 45:11.710
What are you talking about?

45:11.752 --> 45:13.945
And I'm very sorry about that.

45:15.446 --> 45:17.507
No, Tom, no...

45:24.330 --> 45:26.516
Fuck. Fuck!

46:29.020 --> 46:30.914
I have a surprise for you.

46:30.956 --> 46:32.582
I don't like surprises.

46:32.624 --> 46:36.336
I don't like them either, but...

46:36.777 --> 46:37.963
this is a good one.

46:38.005 --> 46:39.256
Yeah?

46:39.298 --> 46:40.674
Okay.

46:41.248 --> 46:42.700
What you got?

46:46.221 --> 46:48.497
I want you to come away with me.

46:51.459 --> 46:52.835
What do you mean?

46:53.895 --> 46:55.504
Right now.

46:58.341 --> 47:00.527
You're not too busy running for mayor?

47:00.569 --> 47:02.446
Just one night, and, you know,

47:02.487 --> 47:04.156
my numbers are up.

47:04.639 --> 47:07.034
I think it would be good
just to get away from all this.

47:07.075 --> 47:08.517
Yeah.

47:09.786 --> 47:11.496
Sounds good to me.

47:11.538 --> 47:13.707
- Good.
- Yeah.

47:13.749 --> 47:15.417
So, where-where are we going?

47:16.108 --> 47:18.295
Really? It's a surprise.

47:18.819 --> 47:20.589
Okay.

47:20.630 --> 47:21.965
I'm intrigued.

47:22.007 --> 47:24.301
Good.

47:24.343 --> 47:25.510
I think it's gonna be good.

47:26.535 --> 47:28.221
Would you go to the beach?

47:28.579 --> 47:29.997
Right now.

47:31.165 --> 47:32.625
Well...

47:33.643 --> 47:35.937
just go stand on the beach
and wait for you?

47:35.979 --> 47:37.129
Yes.

47:39.274 --> 47:41.985
Okay. You're gonna leave
and go home, aren't you?

47:44.178 --> 47:46.323
Well, should I just leave a credit card,

47:46.365 --> 47:48.408
- and they can bring...?
- No, everything's taken care of.

47:48.450 --> 47:50.786
- Really?
- Of course.

47:50.827 --> 47:52.329
No shit.

47:52.371 --> 47:53.985
I'll see you in a little bit.

47:54.010 --> 47:55.172
Yeah.

48:30.700 --> 48:32.643
Billy.
