WEBVTT

00:05.573 --> 00:09.009
- None of your
business, Elaine!
- ( audience laughs )

00:10.078 --> 00:12.113
- All: No!
- ( theme music playing )

00:22.256 --> 00:25.025
- OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- A RING STAIN?

00:25.126 --> 00:27.995
I HAVE A BAD HABIT
OF JUST PUTTING MY DRINK
DOWN ON THE TABLE.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.698
BAD HABIT?
PUT YOUR DRINK DOWN
ON THE WOOD?

00:30.798 --> 00:34.502
- LOOK AT THAT STAIN YOU MADE.
- WELL, WE'LL JUST SAND IT
OFF OR SOMETHING.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.340
DO YOU RESPECT WOOD?

00:42.310 --> 00:44.612
I--

00:44.712 --> 00:46.280
- GUESS SO.
- OH MY GOD.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.916
YOU HAD A CUP LIKE THAT
AT JULIA'S PARTY.

00:49.016 --> 00:51.619
YOU LEFT THE RING STAIN
ON JULIA'S TABLE.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.088
SHE BLAMED ME
THE WHOLE TIME,
BUT IT WAS YOU.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.657
- WELL, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.626
IT IS NO BIG DEAL.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.562
HAVING SAID THAT,

01:01.662 --> 01:04.765
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO CALL JULIA AND TELL HER
YOU LEFT THE RING STAIN.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.934
- I'M NOT CALLING JULIA.
- YEAH, JUST TELL HER THAT--

01:07.034 --> 01:09.503
THAT YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO LEFT THE STAIN
ON THE ANTIQUE TABLE.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.272
- HOLD IT ONE SECOND.
- I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

01:11.372 --> 01:12.873
- YEAH, COME ON.
- I'M NOT DOING THAT.

01:12.973 --> 01:15.243
- NO, I WANT YOU TO TALK TO HER.
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO JULIA.

01:15.343 --> 01:19.513
- CHERYL, HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
- OH MY GOD, I AM NOT TALKING
TO JULIA.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.615
- I'M NOT DOING THIS.
- HEY, JULES!

01:21.715 --> 01:24.952
- SHOW WAS FANTASTIC.
- WHAT WAS I THINKING?
WHY WOULD I COME HERE?

01:25.052 --> 01:27.455
I'M NOT TALKING TO JULIA.
I SAID NO

01:27.555 --> 01:29.190
AND YOU DON'T
LISTEN TO ME.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.058
OH WAIT, HOLD--
HOLD ON, OKAY.

01:31.159 --> 01:34.061
CHERYL, WAIT ONE SECOND!
NO NO, I THINK SHE LEFT
THE RING STAIN. HOLD ON.

01:34.162 --> 01:37.231
- HEY, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?
- LEAVING, LARRY.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.733
- HUH? WHY?
- WHY?!

01:39.833 --> 01:41.602
YEAH.
CHERYL!

01:41.702 --> 01:44.472
CHERYL.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.810
( theme music playing )

01:55.916 --> 01:59.052
Man: LARRY, I KNOW DIVORCE
IS PAINFUL, BUT THIS IS
A FANTASTIC DEAL.

01:59.153 --> 02:01.322
IT'S NOT ONLY THE BEST DEAL
I'M GONNA GET FOR YOU,

02:01.422 --> 02:03.090
IT'S THE BEST DEAL THAT
ANYBODY'S GONNA GET FOR ANYBODY.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.259
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP YOUR HOUSE,
YOU'RE KEEPING ALL
YOUR PROPERTY.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.161
YOU KNOW?
I KNOW THAT'S
IMPORTANT TO YOU.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.830
- I GOTTA BE A GOOD GUY.
- YEAH, YOU WILL LOOK LIKE
A GOOD GUY HERE.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.166
- BUT I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO BE A GOOD GUY HERE.
- I KNOW.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.067
- YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
- YES.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.769
- OKAY, YEAH.
- THIS IS WHAT I DO.

02:15.869 --> 02:19.373
YOU'RE COMING OUT AHEAD
IN THIS DEAL AND SHE'S
COMING OUT BEHIND.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.575
IMAGINE LIKE A DUTCH
APPLE PIE, RIGHT?

02:21.675 --> 02:25.045
THE FILLING, THE REAL MEAT
OF THE PIE, IS EVERYTHING
YOU'RE GETTING.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.648
AND THE TOP OF THE PIE
THAT LOOKS SO NICE

02:27.748 --> 02:30.318
IS WHAT SHE'S GETTING.
SHE'S JUST GETTING
THE APPEARANCE.

02:30.418 --> 02:33.321
YEAH, BUT I REALLY LIKE
THAT CRUMBLY STUFF ON THE TOP.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.356
NO, EVERYBODY DOES.
YEAH, IT'S DELICIOUS.

02:35.456 --> 02:38.192
I LIKE THAT MORE THAN THE PIE.
I WOULD RATHER GET THAT

02:38.292 --> 02:41.195
- THAN THE PIE.
- YEAH, I KNOW, BUT IT'S--

02:41.295 --> 02:43.431
BUT THAT'S JUST--
THAT'S A PART OF IT,

02:43.531 --> 02:45.766
BUT THE REAL-- IT WOULDN'T BE
A PIE WITHOUT THE FILLING.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.101
- YEAH, BUT IT'S
MY FAVORITE PART.
- SO LET'S SWITCH IT.

02:48.202 --> 02:51.439
SHE'S GETTING
THE FILLING AND YOU'RE GETTING
THE RAZZLE-DAZZLE THAT IS

02:51.539 --> 02:54.041
- THE BROWN CRUMBLY STUFF.
- THE DELICIOUS BROWN
CRUMBLY STUFF.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.476
- YEAH, YEAH YEAH.
- THE CINNAMON.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.278
IT'S A GOOD DEAL.
IT'S READY TO BE SIGNED.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.979
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE FINE, LARRY.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.282
YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

03:01.382 --> 03:04.218
YOU KNOW WHAT, BERG?
I LIKE THE CUT OF YOUR JIB.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.986
UH, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, CAPTAIN.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

03:06.086 --> 03:09.122
CHERYL AND HER LAWYER
ARE GOING TO BE HERE
IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.

03:09.223 --> 03:12.426
YOU DON'T HAVE TO, BUT IT MIGHT
NOT BE A BAD IDEA FOR YOU TO
STICK AROUND FOR THAT MEETING.

03:12.526 --> 03:16.464
- NO, I'M GONNA GO.
- OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH.
OKAY.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.632
- YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY.
- I LIKE THIS DESK.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.068
- YOU HAVE A LOT
OF ROOM UNDER HERE.
- YEAH, IT'S NICE.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.870
IT'D BE A GOOD DESK
TO GET BLOWJOBS UNDER.

03:22.970 --> 03:26.206
THAT'S NOT WHY I BOUGHT IT,
BUT LET'S CALL IT
A HAPPY ACCIDENT.

03:26.307 --> 03:30.344
- OKAY, BERG.
- LARRY, DON'T WORRY SO MUCH.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.879
- IT'S A GOOD DEAL.
- OKAY, I'M NOT GOING TO WORRY.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.914
I'M GONNA LEAVE IT
IN YOUR HANDS.
I TRUST YOU.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.683
- YOU SHOULD.
- I HAVE A LOT
OF CONFIDENCE IN YOU.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.218
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU, LARRY.
- SEE YOU AROUND.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.754
Cheryl: LARRY.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.391
- OH HEY.
- HI.

03:43.491 --> 03:46.294
- HEY. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- HELLO.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.396
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- THIS IS DAVID RABINOWITZ,

03:48.496 --> 03:49.763
MY ATTORNEY.
THIS IS LARRY DAVID.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.231
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.233
YOU HIRED A BALD MAN, HUH?

03:53.334 --> 03:56.704
UH, THAT WAS
A COINCIDENCE.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.406
I DIDN'T REALLY GO
AFTER A BALD MAN.

03:58.506 --> 04:01.575
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
HAVE RECUSED YOURSELF.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.677
WE CAN'T GO UP
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.746
- IT'S A CODE.
IT'S IN THE BALD CODE.
- IS IT?

04:05.846 --> 04:09.149
- YES, IT IS.
- OH, I DO NEED TO COME BY
AND PICK UP SOME STUFF.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.485
- OH, YOU WANT TO GET
THE BEDDING AND EVERYTHING?
- YES.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.421
I'M GIVING HER
THE BEDDING.
SEE?

04:13.521 --> 04:15.656
- YOU DON'T LIKE THE BEDDING.
- I LIKE THE BEDDING.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.725
AND THE PILLOWS.
I'M GIVING YOU
ALL THOSE PILLOWS.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.628
- YEAH, YOU LIKE--
YOU WANT THAT, RIGHT?
- YEAH, BUT

04:20.728 --> 04:22.696
YOU DON'T LIKE
THOSE PILLOWS EITHER.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.833
I KNOW, BUT I COULD
CHARGE YOU FOR THEM
IF I WASN'T BEING FAIR.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.469
- YOU COULD CHARGE ME
FOR THE PILLOWS?
- YES, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

04:28.569 --> 04:30.571
- I'M NOT SURE.
- TECHNICALLY.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.473
TECHNICALLY.
CORRECT, OKAY?

04:32.573 --> 04:34.875
- OKAY.
- YOUR BALD LAWYER
SAYS TECHNICALLY YES.

04:34.975 --> 04:38.879
AND I CAN CALL YOU BALD.
IT'S LIKE BLACK PEOPLE
CALLING EACH OTHER NIGGA.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.749
- "HEY, BALDY," YOU KNOW?
- OKAY, LET'S-- IT'S BETTER
IF YOU DON'T.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.651
- OKAY.
- I THINK YOU'RE
CROSSING BOUNDARIES

04:43.751 --> 04:45.519
- THAT SHOULDN'T BE CROSSED.
- OKAY.

04:47.020 --> 04:50.558
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M PRACTICING A TIC
I'M WORKING ON.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.629
YOU KNOW, FOR DATING.
I'M JUST WONDERING IF SHE'LL
POINT IT OUT, THAT'S ALL.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.731
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
ON YOUR DATES?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.733
- YEAH, I'LL JUST
KEEP GOING LIKE THIS.
- YOU MAKE UP A TIC

04:59.833 --> 05:01.935
- TO SEE HOW LONG YOUR--
OKAY, UM...
- YEAH.

05:02.035 --> 05:06.540
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK IF
YOU WERE SITTING ACROSS FROM
SOMEBODY GOING LIKE THIS?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.676
IF HE WAS DOING IT
ON PURPOSE, I WOULD THINK
HE WAS AN ASSHOLE.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.379
ONLY BECAUSE I TOLD YOU
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.847
BUT IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW ME
AND WE HAD JUST MET,

05:13.947 --> 05:16.984
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE SITTING ACROSS
FROM ME AND I'M GOING--

05:17.084 --> 05:19.420
OKAY, THAT DOESN'T WORK.
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
DO THAT.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.689
( chuckles )
WH-- WHY NOT?
HUH?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.691
- LET'S GO.
- IT'S JUST A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.593
- Cheryl: I'LL TEXT YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.628
Rabinowitz:
NICE MEETING YOU.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.764
Larry:
I GOT THE SHARPEST
JEWISH DIVORCE LAWYER IN TOWN.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.800
- HE'S TERRIFIC.
- Jeff: YOU LIKE BERG?

05:32.900 --> 05:35.268
- I LIKE HIM A LOT, YEAH.
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU AND I EVER SPLIT UP,

05:35.369 --> 05:37.304
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
WE GET A DIVORCE,

05:37.405 --> 05:39.673
50-50.
YOU TAKE WHATEVER
50% YOU WANT.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.642
I'LL TAKE WHAT'S LEFT.
NO ARGUING,

05:41.742 --> 05:44.678
- NO NEGATIVITY.
- WHAT, ARE YOU FUCKING
KIDDING ME?

05:44.778 --> 05:47.581
YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A NICE DIVORCE IF WE
EVER GET DIVORCED?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.584
NO FUCKING WAY.
I'M TAKING YOU FOR
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE, MISTER.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.821
I'M TAKING YOUR BALLS
AND I'M THUMBTACKING
THEM TO THE WALL.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.757
YOU'RE GONNA GET NOTHING
OUT OF IT. YOU MENTION
THE "D" WORD ONCE

05:56.857 --> 05:59.627
IN YOUR FUCKING LIFE,
YOU'LL RUE THE DAY
YOU EVER MET ME.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.470
OKAY.
I'VE GOT SOME
GREAT NEWS.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.940
GUESS WHERE THE FUNKMAN
IS GOING FOR THREE WEEKS.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.476
- MIAMI?
- LONDON!

06:15.576 --> 06:17.110
- LONDON!
- OH AH!

06:17.210 --> 06:20.113
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
- ON BUSINESS, HOW GREAT
IS THAT?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.482
- WOW, THAT'S FUN.
- ARE YOU GOING?

06:21.582 --> 06:23.451
- NO.
- OH, REALLY?

06:23.551 --> 06:26.286
- SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO TRAVEL.
- I DON'T GO ON BUSINESS TRIPS
WITH HIM.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.188
- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE?
- NO.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.525
OH MY GOD, YOU SHOULD GO.
IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.394
- HMM, REALLY?
- YEAH!

06:34.495 --> 06:36.196
- LONDON!
- MAYBE I SHOULD GO, MARTY.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.832
NO, IT'S COLD.
RIGHT NOW IT'S COLD
AND FOGGY AND DANGEROUS.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.702
THEY HAVE GANGS OVER THERE
AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND I'LL
BE DOING BUSINESS.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.505
I NEVER TRAVEL WITH YOU.
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
I'M GOING.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.040
- LET'S TALK ABOUT--
- THANK YOU.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.543
THAT'S DECIDED.
I'M IN.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.514
UM...

06:53.614 --> 06:56.149
- WHAT'S EVERYBODY
GETTING FOR LUNCH?
- FISH CHOWDER.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.118
GONNA HAVE SOME SORT
OF LIGHT SALAD.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.420
- I'M NOT THAT HUNGRY.
- I THINK I'M GONNA
GET THE BUFFET.

07:00.521 --> 07:03.223
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.
I'LL BE BACK.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.693
- THE FISH CHOWDER'S YUMMY.
- LARRY!

07:05.793 --> 07:07.561
- HEY, JOE.
- LARRY, HOW ARE YOU?

07:07.661 --> 07:09.162
- PRETTY GOOD.
- Susie: ANNA!

07:09.262 --> 07:11.264
- OH MY GOD, HOW ARE YOU?
- RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT,
THIS IS ANNA.

07:11.364 --> 07:14.034
HEY, THIS IS--
YOU KNOW JOE O'DONNELL,
THE OWNER OF THE DODGERS.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.203
- YES.
- HI, EVERYBODY.
I DIDN'T WANT TO INTERRUPT.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.271
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

TOGETHER.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.641
- HOW ARE YOU?
THINGS GOING GOOD?
- GREAT GREAT, YEAH.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.810
DID YOU SPEAK TO ANDY TODAY?
OUR FEARLESS ATTORNEY?

07:22.910 --> 07:25.378
- WE HAVE THE SAME
DIVORCE LAWYER.
- OH YES!

07:25.479 --> 07:27.247
OH, THE FUN
WE'RE HAVING.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.817
- HOW'S IT GOING WITH YOU?
- WELL...

07:29.917 --> 07:32.219
YOU KNOW,
IT'S COMPLICATED
TO SAY THE LEAST.

07:32.319 --> 07:35.422
THE TEAM IS--
THE TEAM'S AN ASSET

07:35.523 --> 07:37.758
AND IT'S KIND OF A LITTLE
PRECARIOUS RIGHT NOW.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.427
I THINK HE'LL
COME THROUGH FOR US THOUGH.
I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.295
- YEAH, HE'S GOOD.
- BY THE WAY, WOULD YOU BE...

07:42.395 --> 07:44.832
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN COMING OUT, SITTING
IN A BOX WITH ME?

07:44.932 --> 07:46.634
- OH, THAT'D BE FUN.
- WE CAN COMMISERATE,

07:46.734 --> 07:49.069
DISCUSS WHY THE HELL WE GOT
MARRIED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.271
YEAH, I'D BE
INTERESTED.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.373
- YES.
- OH, WE SHOULD TELL THEM.

07:53.473 --> 07:57.978
JOE'S 13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
KYRA IS GOING TO BE KNOCKING
ON YOUR DOORS POSSIBLY.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.480
- LOOK OUT!
- SHE'S SELLING
GIRL SCOUT COOKIES.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.716
- IT'S THE LAST WEEK.
- SHE'S GOING FOR THE RECORD
THIS YEAR.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.885
- SHE WAS CLOSE.
- WE'RE IN, RIGHT, JEFF?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.555
I'LL BE SLAMMING THE DOOR
IN HER FACE. I HOPE THAT
DOESN'T BOTHER YOU.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.723
- OH COME ON, GIVE HER A BREAK.
- WE'RE SENDING HER
TO YOU FIRST.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.091
SHE'S COMING.
BE PREPARED.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.594
- TAKE CARE, EVERYBODY.
- NICE TO SEE YOU.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.700
- OH, OKAY!
- HUH?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.234
- THERE YOU GO.
- YOU LOVING THAT?

08:21.334 --> 08:24.605
- THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.
- I TOLD YOU THE BUFFET, MAN.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.874
- BOY, DID WE DO
THE WRONG THING.
- SHRIMP?

08:26.974 --> 08:30.878
- CRAB LEGS, SHRIMP, POTATOES.
- I'M STILL A LITTLE BIT HUNGRY.
CAN I TAKE A COUPLE POTATOES?

08:30.978 --> 08:32.646
- HELP YOURSELF.
- Funkhouser: LOOK AT THAT.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.514
- TAKE A CRAB LEG.
ABSOLUTELY.
- ARE YOU SURE?

08:34.615 --> 08:37.217
- TAKE SOME SHRIMP TOO.
- I'LL TAKE TWO SHRIMP.
THERE WE GO.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.719
- THANK YOU.
- TAKE THREE.
YOU WANT THREE?

08:38.819 --> 08:40.754
NO, TWO'S PLENTY.
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.524
- Funkhouser: WHEN YOU
GO BACK, GET ME SOME.
- HI, I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.561
UM, BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE
FROM THE BUFFET

08:47.661 --> 08:49.763
AND SHARE WITH SOMEONE
WHO'S ORDERED OFF THE MENU.

08:49.863 --> 08:53.200
SO UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO CHARGE YOU
FOR AN ADDITIONAL BUFFET.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.335
- IT SAYS IT'S ALL YOU CAN EAT.
- IT'S ALL YOU CAN EAT.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.738
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
IF I GIVE IT TO
SOMEBODY ELSE?

08:57.838 --> 08:59.740
BECAUSE THEN HE'S EATING IT.
IT'S ALL HE CAN EAT ALSO.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.543
I WASN'T GOING TO MAKE
A SECOND VISIT. THIS IS IT.
THIS IS MY ONLY PLATE.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.546
- BUT HOW AM I TO KNOW THAT?
- IT DOESN'T SAY THAT
YOU CAN'T--

09:06.647 --> 09:09.016
EXCUSE ME, MAYBE I CAN HELP.
HELLO, I'M HIRIAM KATZ,

09:09.116 --> 09:11.752
ATTORNEY-AT-LAW.
MAYBE I CAN STRAIGHTEN
THIS OUT.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.454
FIRST OF ALL, IN YOUR IMPLIED
CONTRACT WITH THIS MAN

09:14.554 --> 09:17.524
THERE IS NOTHING THAT
ALLOWS YOU TO RESTRICT WHAT HE
DOES WITH YOUR PRODUCT

09:17.625 --> 09:20.594
AFTER HE PURCHASES IT,
SO HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS
WITH THE FOOD.

09:20.694 --> 09:24.131
AND SECONDLY, IF YOU SUSPECT
THAT HE'S STEALING ANOTHER
BUFFET FROM YOU,

09:24.231 --> 09:26.466
YOU'D HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO ESTABLISH PRIOR INTENT.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.335
NOW CAN YOU PROVE
PRIOR INTENT?

09:28.435 --> 09:30.303
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.340
SO IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT,
I'M AFRAID THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING YOU CAN DO

09:33.440 --> 09:36.810
EXCEPT PROBABLY APOLOGIZE
TO THESE PEOPLE AND MAYBE
BUY THEM A ROUND OF DRINKS.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.946
HMM?

09:40.280 --> 09:42.049
I'M SORRY AND...

09:42.149 --> 09:44.818
I'D BE HAPPY TO GET YOU
A ROUND OF DRINKS.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.720
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.355
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.258
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.
I HATE TO SEE PEOPLE
RIPPED OFF THAT WAY.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.761
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD DIVE IN.
I AM HIRIAM KATZ,

09:53.861 --> 09:55.629
ATTORNEY-AT-LAW.
HERE'S MY CARD.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.331
ENJOY YOUR BRUNCH.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.571
HEY, HOW ABOUT O'DONNELL
INVITING ME TO SIT IN HIS BOX?

10:04.672 --> 10:06.173
THAT'S SOME COOL SHIT.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.941
- THIS IS GONNA BE
GREAT FOR US, MAN.
- I KNOW.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.910
THIS IS BETTER THAN--
EXCUSE ME?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.544
- IT'S GREAT FOR US.
- GREAT FOR US?

10:11.645 --> 10:14.281
- IT'S GREAT FOR ME.
- THE HOOKUP ALWAYS COMES
WITH A PLUS ONE.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.516
- THERE'S NO PLUS ONE HERE.
- I GET HOOKED UP,

10:16.616 --> 10:19.119
- YOU GET
HOOKED UP ALL THE TIME.
- YOU'VE NEVER GOTTEN A HOOKUP!

10:19.219 --> 10:20.821
I GOT PLENTY OF HOOKUPS, LARRY.
YOU DON'T SEE THEM.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.790
YOU DON'T NOTICE
THE SMALL SHIT, LARRY!

10:22.890 --> 10:24.892
WHAT SMALL SHIT?
THERE HASN'T BEEN
ANY SMALL THINGS.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.727
- IT'S THE SMALL THINGS, LARRY.
- ( doorbell rings )

10:26.827 --> 10:28.796
- THERE'S NO PLUS ONE.
- THERE'S ALWAYS A PLUS ONE.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.498
HI, IS THIS
LARRY DAVID'S HOUSE?

10:31.598 --> 10:35.502
- THIS IS LARRY DAVID.
- OH, HI. I'M KYRA,
JOE'S DAUGHTER.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.304
- KYRA O'DONNELL!
- YEAH.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.939
- HEY.
- HEY.

10:39.039 --> 10:42.275
- UM, DO YOU LIKE
GIRL SCOUT COOKIES?
- I FIND THEM ABHORRENT.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.144
- BUT COME IN.
- OKAY, COOL.

10:44.244 --> 10:47.447
UM, SO WE'RE IN STOCK
ON A LOT OF THE COOKIES.

10:47.547 --> 10:48.949
- OKAY.
- WHICH IS GOOD NEWS.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.384
UM, WE HAVE THANK U
BERRY MUNCH COOKIES.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.553
OH, THANK U
BERRY MUNCH, OOOOH.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.723
TH-TH-TH-THANK U
BERRY MUNCH.

10:55.823 --> 10:58.391
( giggles )
WE HAVE THE TAGALONGS.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.592
- TAGALONGS.
- YEAH.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.628
WE HAVE THE...

11:01.729 --> 11:03.997
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT EVEN INTERESTED.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.900
GIVE ME FIVE BOXES
OF EACH OF THEM.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.736
- REALLY?
- YEAH, WHAT DO YOU
SAY TO THAT?

11:08.836 --> 11:11.371
- THAT'S AWESOME.
- HUH? NOT BAD, RIGHT?

11:11.471 --> 11:14.074
OKAY, YEAH.
UM, WELL, YOU COULD JUST
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.609
ALL RIGHT.
NOW YOU SEE, THESE SAMOAS,

11:16.710 --> 11:18.345
THAT LOOKS
PRETTY GOOD ACTUALLY.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.814
IT'S COVERED WITH CARAMEL,
ROLLED IN TOASTED COCONUT.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.683
'CAUSE I'M A HUGE
COCONUT GUY.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.887
EVERYTHING OKAY?

11:26.987 --> 11:32.359
I, UH, THINK I JUST HAD
MY FIRST PERIOD.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.799
OKAY.
THAT'S... YEAH.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.401
OKAY, SO THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.636
THAT'S NO PROBLEM AT ALL.
YOU KNOW WHY?
IN FACT,

11:43.737 --> 11:46.273
I GOT AN EX-WIFE
AND I WAS MARRIED

11:46.373 --> 11:48.175
AND SHE'S A WOMAN.
SHE LEFT STUFF UPSTAIRS

11:48.275 --> 11:50.243
THAT'S GOING TO BE
VERY VALUABLE TO YOU.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.980
I'M GOING TO RUN UP
AND GET IT. YOU STAY
RIGHT HERE. DON'T MOVE.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.182
OKAY, DON'T WORRY.
YOU HAD IT IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

11:55.282 --> 11:58.018
I'M NOT KIDDING.
I GOT THIS.
I GOT THIS.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.487
STAY RIGHT THERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.923
OK-KAY

12:03.791 --> 12:05.759
OKAY, GOT IT.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.362
HERE YOU GO,
ALL RIGHT.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.733
ALL RIGHT, GOOD LUCK.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.470
UM, I DON'T REALLY KNOW
HOW TO USE ONE OF THESE.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.942
OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S INSTRUCTIONS HERE.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.013
UM...

12:27.848 --> 12:29.983
OKAY OKAY.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.219
"IF YOU'RE USING A TAMPON,
YOU'LL SEE THAT

12:32.319 --> 12:34.487
THE PLASTIC APPLICATOR
IS MADE OF TWO TUBES.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.190
- ONE--"
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"PLASTIC APPLICATOR"?

12:37.290 --> 12:39.292
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS IS.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.363
I JUST DON'T GET
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.499
OH OKAY.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.336
"HOLD THE APPLICATOR LIGHTLY
ON THE OUTER INSERTION TUBE

12:49.436 --> 12:51.704
AT THE GRIP LOCATION WITH YOUR
THUMB AND MIDDLE FINGER."

12:51.805 --> 12:53.373
- WHAT THE FUCK?
- LIGHTLY?

12:53.473 --> 12:55.375
- WHAT DO--
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO--
- WAIT A SECOND.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.845
"GENTLY SLIDE THE APPLICATOR
ALL THE WAY INTO YOUR VAGI--"

12:57.945 --> 13:00.547
HOW DO I KNOW
IF I'M DOING IT RIGHT?

13:00.647 --> 13:04.384
I'VE NEVER USED ONE
OF THESE AND I'M REALLY
FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.719
OH, OKAY!

13:06.820 --> 13:08.555
I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.757
LOOK, IT PUSHES IT OUT.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.861
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE READING
THE RIGHT DIRECTIONS?
- NO, LISTEN TO ME.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.763
LISTEN TO ME.
TAKE THE INSIDE WHERE
THE STRING IS

13:16.864 --> 13:19.232
AND PUSH IT--
PUSH IT.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.701
- PUSH IT?
- PUSH IT.
YOU'LL SEE A COTTON--

13:21.801 --> 13:24.337
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- YOU'LL SEE A COTTON PIECE
COME OUT.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.973
OKAY, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.607
- CAN YOU TALK
A LITTLE SLOWER?
- OKAY.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.409
- THERE'S A TUBE, RIGHT?
- YES.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.211
- THERE'S AN OUTER TUBE
AND AN INNER TUBE.
- INNER TUBE?

13:31.311 --> 13:33.546
PUT THE OUTER TUBE
IN YOUR VAGINA.

13:33.646 --> 13:37.084
- AND-AND--
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.152
TAKE THE--

13:39.252 --> 13:42.355
TAKE THE OUTER TUBE,
TAKE YOUR THUMB AND
MIDDLE FINGER...

13:42.455 --> 13:45.558
- WAIT, WHAT?
- ...AND PUSH THAT TUBE
FORWARD.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.561
- IT COMES OUT OF THE PLASTIC!
- WAIT, THAT SEEMS WRONG.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.865
LOOK, IT CAME
OUT OF THE PLASTIC.
I'M HOLDING IT!

13:51.965 --> 13:54.167
- OKAY--
- YOU GOT IT?

13:54.267 --> 13:56.236
I THINK SO.
I THINK I GOT IT.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.537
ALL RIGHT!

14:16.623 --> 14:18.725
Larry:
SO I'M AT A LIGHT ON BUNDY

14:18.825 --> 14:20.427
GUY PULLS UP NEXT TO ME
ON A MOTORCYCLE,

14:20.527 --> 14:23.363
- GUESS WHO IT TURNS OUT TO BE.
- PORTIA DE ROSSI.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.898
- HUH-UH.
- WHO?

14:24.998 --> 14:27.300
- ANDREW BERG, MY LAWYER.
- REALLY? ON A MOTORCYCLE?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.602
YEAH.
WHAT IS A JEW DOING
ON A MOTORCYCLE?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.405
I NEVER RECALL EVER SEEING
A JEW ON A MOTORCYCLE.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.575
- DID YOU EVER WANT
TO GET A MOTORCYCLE?
- I ONCE GOT ON A MOTOR SCOOTER

14:35.675 --> 14:37.177
AND GOT ABOUT 30 FEET
AND FELL.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.312
- MOTOR SCOOTER?
WHEN DID THIS OCCUR?
- I WAS IN COLLEGE.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.981
- OH, YOU WERE IN COLLEGE.
- YEAH.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.715
SO YOU HAD A BIG 'FRO
ON A MOTOR SCOOTER?

14:42.815 --> 14:45.752
- YES, YEAH.
- IT'S NOT THIS LARRY
ON THE MOTOR SCOOTER.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.055
IT'S YOUNG LARRY
WITH THE BIG 'FRO.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.190
RIGHT, IT'S 'FRO LARRY.
'FRO--

14:50.290 --> 14:54.027

14:58.265 --> 15:00.233
THIS HAPPENS
TO BE VERY IN.
JOHN VARVATOS...

15:00.333 --> 15:02.335
- REALLY?
- ...HIS ENTIRE
FALL COLLECTION...

15:02.435 --> 15:04.537
- IS THAT RIGHT? CAMOUFLAGE,
IS THAT THE NEW THING?
- ...IS CAMOUFLAGE.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.473
YES.
LISTEN, YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.942
YOU BETTER GO
OVER TO O'DONNELL
AND APOLOGIZE.

15:09.042 --> 15:12.345
- WHY, WHAT DID I DO?
- YOU'RE TEACHING HIS DAUGHTER
HOW TO PUT IN A TAMPON?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.847
- HE'S VERY UPSET ABOUT IT.
- OH, COME ON!

15:14.948 --> 15:16.549
IF HER NOSE IS RUNNING
AND SHE NEEDED A TISSUE,

15:16.649 --> 15:18.518
I WOULD HAVE
GIVEN HER A TISSUE.
SAME THING.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.887
NO, NOT THE SAME THING.
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.956
- IT'S A TAMPON.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:23.056 --> 15:26.193
- THE GIRL WAS HAVING
HER PERIOD IN MY HOUSE.
- IT'S NOT MY ISSUE, LARRY!

15:26.293 --> 15:28.328
IT'S HIS ISSUE.
I'M JUST THE MESSENGER.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.363
DON'T KILL THE MESSENGER,
AS THEY SAY.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.665
- I WOULDN'T MIND
KILLING THE MESSENGER.
- YEAH, I BET.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.767
- ( doorbell rings )
- SAY THOSE THINGS WHEN
YOU REALLY LOVE ME.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.836
- I THINK THE WHOLE
THING IS CRAZY.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:36.936 --> 15:39.339
- I DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA
GIVE YOU THOSE TICKETS.
- REALLY?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.674
- THAT'S SO RIDICULOUS.
- SO GO APOLOGIZE.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.577
- WHAT'S THE BIG FUCKING DEAL?
- I'M GONNA GO OVER THERE
AND TALK TO HIM.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.447
- HI, MARTY.
- HI, SUSIE.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.583
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
IT'S THE BIG FUNK.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.419
YOU ARE A COLOSSAL PRICK.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.421
- ( laughs )
- DO YOU KNOW THAT?

15:54.521 --> 15:57.057
- BOY, I'M REALLY
GETTING IT TODAY.
- YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY?

15:57.157 --> 15:58.925
- WHAT DID I DO?
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.861
YOU RUINED
MY WHOLE VACATION.
YOU HAD TO BUTT IN

16:01.961 --> 16:03.496
AND TELL NAN
TO GO ON MY TRIP.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.999
- I'M SORRY.
- I COULD HAVE
HAD THREE WEEKS

16:06.099 --> 16:08.068
WORKING
AND BEING ALONE.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.237
I WAS CURIOUS AS TO WHY
SHE WASN'T GOING.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.305
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO WITH HER?
WHY DON'T YOU BRING HER?

16:12.405 --> 16:14.874
I'M BORED!
EVERYWHERE I GO WITH HER
WE DON'T LOOK AT EACH OTHER,

16:14.974 --> 16:17.110
SHE TALKS OVER ME.
I WANT TO BE ALONE.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.346
I WANT TO GET THE CHANCE
TO SPREAD MY WINGS.

16:19.446 --> 16:22.415
- WHY DON'T YOU GET A DIVORCE?
- I'M TOO LAZY.

16:29.022 --> 16:32.025
COMING!
YES, MAY I HELP YOU?

16:32.125 --> 16:34.094
I'M HERE TO SEE
MR. O'DONNELL.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.896

16:42.669 --> 16:45.105
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE
DOESN'T WANT TO SEE ME?
WHY?

16:45.205 --> 16:47.874
MR. O'DONNELL SAY YOU DID
BAD THING TO MISS KYRA.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.742
- A BAD THING?
- YES.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.344
OH NO NO NO NO NO.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.646
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING BAD
TO MISS KYRA.

16:53.746 --> 16:57.016
I CLOSE DOOR.

CLOSE DOOR ON HIM."

16:57.117 --> 16:58.585

16:58.685 --> 17:00.653
I'M SUPPOSED TO GO
TO THE BASEBALL GAME
WITH HIM.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.323
- YOU HAVE TICKET?
- NO, BUT HE ASKED ME
IF I WAS INTERESTED

17:03.423 --> 17:05.125
AND I SAID I'D BE
VERY INTERESTED.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.060
INTERESTED DOESN'T
MEAN TICKET.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.795
YEAH, INTERESTED
MEANS TICKET!

17:08.895 --> 17:10.863
I'M INTERESTED,
I HAVE NO TICKET.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.166
GARDENER INTERESTED,
CHAUFFER INTERESTED,

17:13.266 --> 17:15.435
COOK INTERESTED--
COOK MORE INTERESTED THAN ME,

17:15.535 --> 17:17.470
HE HAS NO TICKET!

17:24.010 --> 17:25.512
- Larry: NO.
- I CAN'T HAVE THEM?

17:25.612 --> 17:27.180
- NO.
- THAT'S WHERE YOU
DRAW THE LINE?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.149
- I LOVE THOSE.
- NO.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.783
WHAT?
PUT THOSE BACK.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.420
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE?

17:33.520 --> 17:35.788
I DON'T CARE.
YOU'RE NOT COMING UP HERE
AND STEALING THOSE!

17:35.888 --> 17:37.590
- THOSE THINGS.
- YES.

17:37.690 --> 17:41.361
WELL, OKAY, IF YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND, LET ME KNOW
AND I'LL...

17:41.461 --> 17:43.663
- I WILL, I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
- ...I WILL RETURN THEM
IMMEDIATELY.

17:43.763 --> 17:47.467
- I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
- I KNOW, IT'S KINDA WEIRD
WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY

17:47.567 --> 17:50.203
- SIGN THE PAPERS, RIGHT?
- YEAH, WE'RE GONNA SIGN
THOSE PAPERS.

17:50.303 --> 17:53.240
- I'M FINE WITH IT.
- YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE,
AFTER THEY GET DIVORCED,

17:53.340 --> 17:55.308
THEY LOOK AT THEIR MARRIAGE
LIKE IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME?

17:55.408 --> 17:57.009
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- I DON'T EITHER.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.978
TO ME, IT'S KIND OF
LIKE PUBLIC SCHOOL.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.947
YOU WENT TO SCHOOL,
YOU GOT THROUGH IT

18:01.047 --> 18:03.350
- AND NOW YOU MOVE ON.
- WHAT'D YOU LEARN?

18:03.450 --> 18:05.752
I WOULDN'T BE TONGUE SCRAPING
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

18:05.852 --> 18:09.021
- LOOK WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME.
- AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TAKING
AWAY FROM OUR MARRIAGE.

18:09.122 --> 18:12.259
- YES.
- OKAY, I'M GLAD YOU'RE
TAKING SOMETHING WITH YOU.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.294
- HEY, BEFORE YOU GO.
- YES?

18:14.394 --> 18:16.196
DO YOU THINK
THERE'S ANY CHANCE
WE COULD HAVE SEX?

18:16.296 --> 18:18.498
- UM, NO.
- COME ON.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.867
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
HONESTLY, THINK ABOUT IT,

18:20.967 --> 18:23.270
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
LET'S JUST DO IT.
COME ON.

18:23.370 --> 18:24.837
WHAT HAVE I DONE?
NAME ONE THING I'VE DONE

18:24.937 --> 18:26.873
THAT MAKES YOU THINK I WANT
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.975
- WELL, UM...
- I'M TALKING TO YOU?

18:29.075 --> 18:30.810
YES, YOU'RE TALKING TO ME.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.446
- THAT'S ALL YOU NEED?
- YEAH. WHEN THERE ARE WOMEN
IN THIS BEDROOM,

18:33.546 --> 18:36.015
IT SEEMS CRAZY IF
I DON'T AT LEAST OFFER.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.418
OH, I MEANT TO TELL YOU--
THIS IS INTERESTING--

18:38.518 --> 18:40.420
- YOU KNOW YOUR ATTORNEY?
- ANDREW BERG!

18:40.520 --> 18:43.256
ANDREW BERG WENT
TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH JULIE

18:43.356 --> 18:45.892
AT ST. CHRISTOPHER'S.
THEY ACTUALLY SAT NEXT
TO EACH OTHER--

18:45.992 --> 18:48.795
WAIT A SECOND.
HOW COULD ANDREW BERG

18:48.895 --> 18:51.398
GO TO ST. CHRISTOPHER'S?
ISN'T THAT A CATHOLIC SCHOOL?

18:51.498 --> 18:54.100
- YEAH.
- ( doorbell rings )

18:54.201 --> 18:57.604
I SAW HIM
ON THAT MOTORCYCLE

18:57.704 --> 18:59.539
THE OTHER DAY.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.443
- OH WELL.
- Girls: HI!

19:03.543 --> 19:06.313
- GOOD AFTERNOON.
- HELLO. GOOD AFTERNOON.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.948
SO WE'RE TROOP 205
AND WE'RE HERE TO COLLECT

19:09.048 --> 19:11.117
THE MONEY
FROM THE COOKIES, MR. DAVID,

19:11.218 --> 19:13.453
THAT KYRA SAID YOU WERE
INTERESTED IN BUYING.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.989
FIRST OF ALL, I COMMEND YOU
ON THE DEMOGRAPHICS.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.625
All:
THANK YOU.

19:18.725 --> 19:22.028
A BLACK, AN ASIAN AND--
ARE YOU A JEW PERCHANCE?

19:22.128 --> 19:25.698
- UH, NO.
- OH OKAY, STILL,

19:25.798 --> 19:27.667
WONDERFUL.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.903
REGARDING THE COOKIES,
THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE
OF PLANS.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.173
SORRY TO SAY,

19:34.274 --> 19:35.708
I NO LONGER WANT THEM.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.245
BUT KYRA SAID YOU WERE
INTERESTED IN BUYING THEM.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.547
I WAS INTERESTED AND NOW,

19:40.647 --> 19:42.615
AS A RESULT
OF SOME DIFFICULTIES
WITH HER FATHER,

19:42.715 --> 19:44.784
- I'M NO LONGER INTERESTED.
- WHAT?

19:44.884 --> 19:47.220
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ANY MONEY FROM ME.
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

19:47.320 --> 19:49.522
- BE A GENTLEMAN.
- I AM A GENTLEMAN, YOUNG LADY!

19:49.622 --> 19:51.691
- OH NO, YOU'RE NOT!
- A REAL GENTLEMAN...

19:51.791 --> 19:53.993
- WOULD GIVE US THE MONEY.
- ...WOULD GIVE US
THE MONEY, YEAH.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.395
- I AM A GENTLEMAN--
- NO, YOU'RE NOT!

19:55.495 --> 19:57.196
- YES, I AM A GENTLEMAN.
- YOU CAN'T JUST DO THAT!

19:57.297 --> 19:58.498
- YES, YEAH, I'M DOING IT.
- NO!

19:58.598 --> 20:00.333
YOU GO TALK
TO JOE O'DONNELL.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.201
ASK HIM WHY THERE'S NOT
GOING TO BE ANY COOKIES!

20:02.302 --> 20:04.504
- ( girls yelling )
- OH, TOO BAD!

20:05.505 --> 20:06.539
JERK!

20:06.639 --> 20:08.675
Berg:
HEY, LOOK WHO'S HERE!

20:08.775 --> 20:10.810
- HELLO, BERG.
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

20:10.910 --> 20:12.745
I'M FEELING OKAY.
SO, BERG,

20:12.845 --> 20:15.448
I WAS TALKING TO CHERYL
AND SHE TOLD ME

20:15.548 --> 20:18.184
THAT A FRIEND OF HERS

20:18.285 --> 20:20.553
WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
WITH YOU.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.356
- REALLY?
- YES.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.458
I THINK THE NAME
OF THE HIGH SCHOOL WAS...

20:25.558 --> 20:29.329
- ST.... CHRISTOPHER'S.
- ST. CHRISTOPHER'S,
THAT'S CORRECT.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.398
THAT IS MY ALMA MATER, YES.

20:31.498 --> 20:34.901
DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY TOOK JEWS
AT ST. CHRISTOPHER'S.

20:35.001 --> 20:38.104
OH, WELL, THEY DON'T.
I MEAN, WHY WOULD THEY?

20:38.204 --> 20:40.440
- OH, I'M NOT--
I'M NOT JEWISH.
- OH!

20:40.540 --> 20:42.675
- YOU'RE NOT.
- DID YOU THINK I WAS JEWISH?

20:42.775 --> 20:45.144
OH-- YES, I DID.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.046
- BECAUSE OF BERG!
- YES, BECAUSE OF BERG.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.515
- BECAUSE OF BERG.
- YES.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.518
- I'VE OFTEN WONDERED
WOULD PEOPLE...
- REALLY?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.753
- ...THINK THAT.
- YES, AND YOU DID NOTHING

20:53.853 --> 20:57.023
- TO PERPETUATE THAT, DID YOU?
- WELL, NO, I MEAN--

20:57.123 --> 20:58.691
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU MEAN.

20:58.791 --> 21:02.228
OH, HOW ABOUT ON MY BIRTHDAY?
"MAZEL TOV, LARRY."

21:02.329 --> 21:04.597
WELL, YOU'RE JEWISH.
IT'S ONLY RESPECTFUL.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.467
ON THE HIGH HOLY DAYS,
I SAID, "HEY, YOU GOING
TO TEMPLE, BERG?"

21:07.567 --> 21:10.069
- AND YOU WENT, "NO."
- RIGHT, 'CAUSE I'M NOT JEWISH

21:10.169 --> 21:11.571
SO WHY WOULD I
GO TO TEMPLE?

21:11.671 --> 21:13.806
RIGHT, LIKE, "I'M A JEW,
BUT NOT A PRACTICING JEW."

21:13.906 --> 21:16.709
- OI, LARRY, WITH THIS--
- OI! AGAIN! SEE?

21:16.809 --> 21:18.745
- IT'S AN EXPRESSION.
- THERE'S ANOTHER--
IT'S AN EXPRESSION?

21:18.845 --> 21:20.513
- IT'S AN EXPRESSION
THAT PEOPLE USE.
- WHAT IS THIS THING?

21:20.613 --> 21:22.482
A SHOFAR.
WHY IS THIS ON YOUR DES?

21:22.582 --> 21:25.184
PEOPLE GIVE ME GIFTS.
THEY'LL GIVE ME LIKE--
THAT FOR MY DESK

21:25.284 --> 21:26.853
OR THE MEZUZAH
THAT'S ON THE DOOR.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.955
- WHAT ARE YOU, BY THE WAY?
- I'M SWEDISH.

21:29.055 --> 21:32.425
I GOT A SWEDE LAWYER?
SHE'S GONNA GET EVERYTHING!

21:32.525 --> 21:34.827
YOU GOT A GOOD LAWYER.
YOU GOT THE BEST LAWYER, LARRY.

21:34.927 --> 21:38.398
- I'M SORRY, BERG.
- IT'S A SHANDA, LARRY.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.601
I GOT SWEDED.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.637
SO DID YOU KNOW BERG
WAS A SWEDE?

21:44.737 --> 21:46.606
I THOUGHT HE WAS JEWISH.
HE SEEMED JEWISH.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.708
WHEN HE FIRST MET ME,
HE CALLED ME A BIG MACHER.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.310
- HE SAID MACHER?
- "MAHER," WAIT, THERE'S MORE.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.912
- WITH THAT PRONUNCIATION?
- MACHER.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.648
- HE HAD THE WHOLE "CH".
- WOW, HE'S SO DEVIOUS.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.650
AND THEN HE'D CALL ME
MAYBE ONCE A MONTH

21:57.750 --> 21:59.652
AND ASK ME IF I WANTED
TO GO FOR A NOSH.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.988
"COME ON, LET'S GO FOR A NOSH.
IT'LL BE GOOD."

22:02.088 --> 22:05.024
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING,
I'M NOT SIGNING ANY PAPERS
UNTIL I GET A NEW LAWYER.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.626
THAT GUY'S
GOT A SCAM GOING.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.327
OH, SEE THAT?

22:08.428 --> 22:10.262
- DID YOU JUST WIN?
- YEAH.

22:10.363 --> 22:12.164
- GAME OVER AGAIN.
- ( doorbell rings )

22:12.264 --> 22:14.066
- HE JUST WON.
- ( Larry snorts )

22:14.166 --> 22:17.570
- COME IN, IT'S OPEN.
- L.D.!

22:17.670 --> 22:20.239
GUESS WHO'S GETTING A DIVORCE.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.242
- WHAT?
- MARTIN NORTON FUNKHOUSER.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.777
- REALLY?
- AND IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU!

22:24.877 --> 22:27.079
THAT MAN AND I WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE LONDON TRIP...

22:27.179 --> 22:29.449
- YEAH?
- ...I STARTED TO REALIZE,
"WAIT A MINUTE.

22:29.549 --> 22:32.284
IF I DID GO TO EUROPE
WITHOUT HER, I'D COME BACK

22:32.385 --> 22:35.422
AND IT WOULD BE 20 MORE
YEARS OF BOREDOM."

22:35.522 --> 22:38.758
SO I SAID TO NAN,
"LOOK, LET'S GET A DIVORCE."

22:38.858 --> 22:40.059
SHE SAID OKAY.

22:40.159 --> 22:43.229
I'M GONNA BE SINGLE!

22:43.329 --> 22:45.064
- YOU AND ME!
- WOW.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.466
- IS THAT GREAT?
- MY MAN.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.034
CONGRATULATIONS.
CONGRATULATIONS.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.403
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU GET A FUCKING
DIVORCE?

22:50.503 --> 22:53.239
RIDE AROUND AND BUMP THE HORN
AND SHIT LIKE MOTHERFUCKERS
GETTING MARRIED.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.274
- WHAT A GREAT IDEA.
- GOD DAMN RIGHT.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.544
- PUT CANS ON YOUR CAR,
BEEP YOUR HORN.
- "JUST DIVORCED."

22:57.644 --> 22:59.912
- Larry: "JUST DIVORCED."
- I'M EXCITED I'M SINGLE.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.014
GET OUT THERE
AND GET SOME NEW ASS,
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

23:02.114 --> 23:04.350
YOU DONE RAN THAT OTHER ASS
IN THE GROUND, RIGHT?

23:04.451 --> 23:06.018
UH, I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT MY WIFE LIKE THAT.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.020
YOU RAN THAT ASS IN THE GROUND
AND YOU'RE MOVING ON, RIGHT?

23:08.120 --> 23:10.089
I DIDN'T RUN ANY--
WE HAD A NICE MARRIAGE
FOR 20 YEARS.

23:10.189 --> 23:13.025
- NO, YOU RAN
THAT ASS IN THE GROUND.
- I DON'T RUN PEOPLE'S ASS

23:13.125 --> 23:14.727
- IN THE GROUND.
- ALL MEN DO.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.664
IT'S NOT A NEGATIVE THING
TO RUN AN ASS IN THE GROUND.
THAT'S ALL.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.766
Leon:
YOU RAN THAT SHIT IN THE GROUD
LIKE A RENT-A-CAR.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.868
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT'S WITH ME?

23:21.968 --> 23:24.671
- WHAT ARE YOU SO GLUM ABOUT?
- IT'S JUST THAT EVERYBODY'S

23:24.771 --> 23:26.873
GETTING A CHANCE TO GET
DIVORCED EXCEPT ME.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.275
YOU GET DIVORCED,
YOU GET DIVORCED,

23:29.375 --> 23:30.877
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED
TO GET DIVORCED.

23:30.977 --> 23:33.379
EVEN THE OWNER OF THE DODGERS,
O'DONNELL, HE GETS A DIVORCE.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.214
Larry:
SHIT, I JUST
REALIZED SOMETHING.

23:35.314 --> 23:38.751
O'DONNELL'S GOT THE SWEDE.
I SHOULD REALLY TELL HIM
ABOUT BERG.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.087
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH BERG?
- HE'S NOT A JEW.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.122
- HE'S A SWEDE.
- HE IS?

23:43.222 --> 23:45.492
I WAS AT HIS HOUSE
FOR HANUKAH.

23:47.326 --> 23:49.596
- HE'S A SWEDE?
- A SWEDE.

23:49.696 --> 23:52.131
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME?
- NO, HE'S A SWEDE.

23:52.231 --> 23:53.933
I JUST--
I MEAN--

23:54.033 --> 23:56.603
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
THAT DIDN'T ADD UP
ABOUT THAT GUY.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.805
- IT'S TRUE.
- HE TOOK ME FOR A RIDE,
THAT'S WHAT HE DID.

23:58.905 --> 24:01.173
- UNBELIEVABLE.
- I DO APPRECIATE YOU

24:01.273 --> 24:02.709
COMING IN HERE
TO TELL ME THIS.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.611
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO AT ALL.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.813
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING WHAT
HAPPENED WITH MY DAUGHTER.

24:06.913 --> 24:09.348
- I FELT I HAD TO TELL YOU.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA DO NOW.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.018
I MEAN, I AM FIGHTING
FOR EVERYTHING HERE.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.987
I COULD LOSE THIS
ENTIRE ORGANIZATION.
THIS WHOLE TEAM!

24:15.087 --> 24:17.824
- I GOT A LOT AT STAKE MYSELF.
- ( sighs )

24:20.627 --> 24:22.929
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:23.029 --> 24:24.864
I GOT JUST THE GUY.

24:26.566 --> 24:29.536
- YOU SURE YOU'RE REALLY JEWISH?
- I'M THE REAL DEAL.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.277
- HOW FUN IS THIS?
- HOW GREAT IS THIS?

24:38.377 --> 24:39.746
TWO SINGLE GUYS
AT A BALLGAME

24:39.846 --> 24:41.280
AND WE'RE SITTING
IN THE OWNER'S BOX.

24:41.380 --> 24:42.782
I KNOW.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

24:42.882 --> 24:44.951
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT STUPID
REMARK YOU SAID TO ME

24:45.051 --> 24:47.554
- CHANGED MY LIFE
FOR THE BETTER.
- ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE?

24:47.654 --> 24:49.255
OH, I LOVE YOU!
HOW IS THAT LAWYER?

24:49.355 --> 24:51.257
- HIRIAM KATZ, HE'S FANTASTIC.
- HE MUST BE GREAT.

24:51.357 --> 24:54.360
HE REDID MY ENTIRE
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT.
YOU'VE GOT TO USE HIM.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.862
- I WILL USE HIM.
- NAMES PLEASE.

24:55.962 --> 24:59.699
LARRY DAVID,
MARTY FUNKHOUSER.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.834
I'M SORRY, GENTLEMEN.
YOUR NAMES ARE NOT
ON THE LIST.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.537
NO NO NO.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.773
LARRY DAVID. I'M A FRIEND
OF JOE O'DONNELL'S.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.308
OH, MR. O'DONNELL
NO LONGER OWNS THE TEAM.

25:09.408 --> 25:11.644
- WHAT?
- HE LOST IT IN THE DIVORCE

25:11.744 --> 25:13.546
SO HIS WIFE OWNS IT NOW.

25:13.646 --> 25:17.016
- HE LOST IT IN THE DIVORCE?
- YES SIR.

25:17.116 --> 25:20.086
DIDN'T YOU RECOMMEND
HIRIAM KATZ TO O'DONNELL?

25:20.186 --> 25:22.722
AND YOU USED HIRIAM KATZ
FOR YOUR DIVORCE?

25:24.323 --> 25:26.458
OH MY GOD!
HE'S MEETING WITH CHERYL'S
LAWYERS RIGHT NOW!

25:26.559 --> 25:29.696
THEY'RE GONNA
FINALIZE THE PAPERS.
I'VE GOT TO GET OVER THERE.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.302
( honks )

25:36.402 --> 25:39.639
( dialing )

25:41.708 --> 25:43.943
- You've reached Hiriam Katz.
- VOICEMAIL!

25:44.043 --> 25:46.078
THIS GUY DOESN'T
HAVE AN ASSISTANT.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.147
- ( beeps )
- KATZ, IT'S LARRY.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.650
DON'T SIGN ANYTHING.
I'M ON MY WAY UP TO YOUR OFFICE.

25:59.759 --> 26:02.461
ASSHOLE!
YOU COST ME THE DODGERS.
