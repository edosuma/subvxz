00:00.039 --> 00:02.025
<i>Previously on...</i>
Beauty & the Beast.

00:02.040 --> 00:04.120
Someone's willing to pay
$5 million to catch a beast.

00:04.593 --> 00:06.527
There's a bounty?
They may be after a beast,

00:06.562 --> 00:07.862
but they do not know
it's Vincent.

00:07.897 --> 00:10.564
But I do and I'm
covering for him.

00:10.599 --> 00:12.300
Don't be a hero.

00:12.335 --> 00:14.768
You tell me who it is
or I'll kill them, too.

00:14.804 --> 00:18.039
I don't think now is the best
time to start seeing somebody.

00:18.074 --> 00:19.907
Why not?
You got family secrets?

00:19.943 --> 00:22.676
You have no idea.
I don't care.

00:24.847 --> 00:27.648
We would be so stupid to take
the next step without you

00:27.683 --> 00:29.383
finding whatever the hell
it is you're looking for.

00:29.418 --> 00:32.386
I just got a group
text message from you.

00:32.421 --> 00:34.588
What?
"911-- meet at cafe now."

00:34.623 --> 00:36.657
They're going after all of us.
Cat, where are you?

00:36.692 --> 00:38.458
It's a trap.
You got to get out of there.

00:38.493 --> 00:39.792
Get down!

00:44.766 --> 00:46.599
Aah!
Vincent!

00:46.634 --> 00:48.935
We think somebody else
is trying to kill Vincent.

00:48.971 --> 00:50.737
Well, you better lay low
until we figure this out.

00:50.772 --> 00:51.771
Can you get
police protection?

00:51.806 --> 00:52.805
It doesn't change the fact

00:52.841 --> 00:53.840
that there's somebody still

00:53.875 --> 00:54.995
out there trying to kill us.

00:55.042 --> 00:56.776
Which leaves us where exactly?

00:56.811 --> 00:58.243
More determined than ever
to kick some ass

00:58.279 --> 01:00.513
and finally get
our "happily ever after" back.

I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.

01:32.579 --> 01:34.145
Sorry, I just--

01:34.180 --> 01:36.648
I don't know what I was doing.

01:36.683 --> 01:39.050
Okay, that was not the kind of
wrestling I was hoping for.

01:39.085 --> 01:40.619
I know, I'm just,
I'm a little on edge, okay?

01:40.654 --> 01:42.554
Please don't sneak up on me.

01:42.589 --> 01:45.289
Why? Because we were ambushed
by snipers two days ago?

01:45.325 --> 01:47.558
Yes, that may have been
when it started.

01:49.829 --> 01:51.896
Well, you're safe now.

01:51.931 --> 01:54.832
And I am definitely unarmed.

01:54.867 --> 01:57.335
Really? Do you mind if I,
uh, if I frisk you?

01:57.370 --> 01:58.903
I insist.

02:01.206 --> 02:03.140
I was just hoping
for one moment

02:03.175 --> 02:05.609
where we didn't
have to worry about

02:05.645 --> 02:07.477
beast bounties
or mystery killers

02:07.513 --> 02:09.613
and just, and just be us.

02:09.649 --> 02:11.649
Like we used to be.

02:11.684 --> 02:12.816
Yeah, "like we used to be."

02:12.852 --> 02:14.484
Really?
Yeah.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.187
There were plenty of romantic
moments in our past.

02:17.222 --> 02:19.989
Oh, yeah, sure, like the time,
that, uh, Gabe tried to date you

02:20.025 --> 02:21.525
and kill me or
the time that Liam

02:21.560 --> 02:23.026
tried to kill us both.

02:23.062 --> 02:24.528
Hang on, here's a fun one.

02:24.563 --> 02:26.864
How about when your father
erased my memory,

02:26.865 --> 02:28.458
and then turned me
into an assassin?

02:28.482 --> 02:29.033
Okay.

02:29.034 --> 02:30.833
What about that moment

02:30.869 --> 02:33.169
right after we said I do?

02:33.204 --> 02:35.038
Okay.

02:35.073 --> 02:38.908
That moment I could possibly
live in forever.

02:40.879 --> 02:43.613
(knocking)

02:43.648 --> 02:45.281
JT: Did you guys die
in there or what?

02:46.751 --> 02:48.718
Hey guys, I call
next for shower, thanks.

02:48.753 --> 02:50.486
It's my bathroom.

02:50.521 --> 02:52.488
I vote we go in order
of who would leave

02:52.523 --> 02:54.457
the least amount of
body hair in the drain.

02:56.727 --> 02:59.861
It's <i>my</i> bathroom!

02:59.897 --> 03:02.131
Or the one time
we were hiding out

03:02.166 --> 03:04.833
in the Gentlemen's Club
with all of our friends.

03:04.868 --> 03:06.668
Uh-uh, where do you think

03:06.704 --> 03:08.269
you're going?

03:17.247 --> 03:19.447
(all clamoring)

03:22.852 --> 03:24.719
Whoa.
Okay!

03:24.754 --> 03:25.868
Just one spoon--
that's all I need.

03:25.869 --> 03:26.419
Here.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.389
Excuse me.
Thank you.

03:28.425 --> 03:29.757
I'm just gonna get this milk
and I'm out.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.192
Uh, excuse me!

03:31.228 --> 03:32.360
I'm sitting here!

03:32.395 --> 03:33.395
I can't find my slippers.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.363
Has anyone seen my slippers?

03:36.966 --> 03:38.833
Uh, did you check over
by your computer?

03:43.973 --> 03:47.108
Seriously?

03:47.143 --> 03:49.543
What? My feet were
cold, and besides,

03:49.578 --> 03:51.078
you let Tess borrow your shirt.

03:51.114 --> 03:52.680
Excuse me, JT
gave me this shirt.

03:52.715 --> 03:54.682
Uh, actually that's my shirt,

03:54.717 --> 03:56.916
JT just wears it
all the time.

03:56.952 --> 03:58.385
All right,
this is officially weird.

03:58.420 --> 03:59.953
Look, we're obviously

03:59.988 --> 04:01.721
in a tense situation.

04:01.757 --> 04:02.756
What, you mean hiding
from a beast buyer

04:02.791 --> 04:04.525
and a mystery killer or the fact

04:04.560 --> 04:06.059
that I have to live with
my ex-boyfriend again?

04:06.094 --> 04:07.060
VINCENT:
Hey, I had to live with

04:07.095 --> 04:08.061
that guy for ten years, too.

04:08.096 --> 04:09.463
Trust me, this isn't

04:09.498 --> 04:10.597
bringing back fond memories
for me, either.

04:10.633 --> 04:12.766
Hurtful.
What about me?

04:12.801 --> 04:14.241
I haven't seen Kyle
in, like, a week.

04:14.269 --> 04:15.869
I finally get
a guy and a job

04:15.904 --> 04:18.303
and suddenly I'm--
Guys! Guys!

04:18.339 --> 04:21.041
We all have lives.

04:21.076 --> 04:22.475
If we're ever
gonna get back to them,

04:22.510 --> 04:23.877
we have to do
what Deputy Secretary Hill said.

04:23.912 --> 04:25.211
Sit here and do nothing.

04:25.246 --> 04:26.946
No.
Stay under the radar

04:26.982 --> 04:28.281
until Hill finds us a lead.

04:28.316 --> 04:29.282
Tess,
whoever's trying to kill

04:29.317 --> 04:30.616
Vincent knew our every move.

04:30.652 --> 04:32.451
He set that trap
for all of us.

04:32.487 --> 04:33.986
And if the mystery killer
could find us...

04:34.021 --> 04:35.921
So can the beast buyer.

04:35.956 --> 04:38.157
Exposure is the worst thing that
could happen to us right now.

04:38.193 --> 04:40.459
Uh, then this
might be a problem.

04:40.495 --> 04:42.662
WOMAN: Our biggest threat
to national security may be

04:42.697 --> 04:44.463
something government officials
aren't talking about.

04:44.499 --> 04:46.799
Months ago,
the murder of a blogger

04:46.834 --> 04:49.634
and a Homeland Security agent
set the Internet buzzing,

04:49.670 --> 04:52.171
but the recent attack
on the deputy secretary himself

04:52.206 --> 04:54.272
raises real questions.

04:54.308 --> 04:56.075
Could there be truth
in the Twitterverse?

04:56.110 --> 04:58.110
Was the Super Soldier program
real?

04:58.145 --> 05:00.679
And what doesn't DHS
want you to know?

05:00.715 --> 05:02.314
I'm Grace Rose.

05:02.349 --> 05:04.282
More tonight at 9:00.

05:04.611 --> 05:06.143
Well, so much for exposure.

05:06.178 --> 05:08.312
She had everything
but my damn picture and name.

05:08.347 --> 05:09.480
Yeah, and that's not
just some nerd blog.

05:09.516 --> 05:11.148
Grace Rose is mainstream.

05:11.183 --> 05:13.417
We have to talk to Hill, now.

05:13.452 --> 05:15.085
Well, what about the rest of us?
Don't answer the door.

05:15.121 --> 05:17.287
Don't answer the phone.
And I can't believe

05:17.323 --> 05:18.922
I'm saying this but, Heather,
maybe you should just

05:18.957 --> 05:20.290
go live with Kyle.
Just for the weekend.

05:20.326 --> 05:23.060
The fewer exposure risks,
the better.

05:23.095 --> 05:25.462
Okay.

05:25.498 --> 05:27.431
So, you two are
stuck together.

05:27.466 --> 05:28.999
I'm out of the loop,
and Vincent and Cat

05:29.035 --> 05:30.501
are skulking in the shadows,
looking for answers.

05:30.536 --> 05:31.835
Great.

05:31.870 --> 05:33.803
Just like old times.

05:37.142 --> 05:39.275
HILL: <i>You want answers,</i>
<i>ask Grace Rose.</i>

05:39.310 --> 05:41.678
Thanks to her report
on DHS cover-ups,

05:41.713 --> 05:43.346
I'm under official
investigation.

05:43.381 --> 05:45.314
What for? Grace Rose
doesn't even know anything.

05:45.350 --> 05:46.850
The press doesn't
have to <i>know</i> anything.

05:46.885 --> 05:48.752
They just have to
ask questions.

05:48.787 --> 05:50.587
Yeah, like, what does
DHS know about beasts?

05:50.622 --> 05:52.588
How'd you answer that one?

05:52.623 --> 05:54.290
Well, I couldn't exactly
tell the Secretary

05:54.325 --> 05:56.259
of Homeland Security
that I lied, covered up

05:56.294 --> 05:58.094
the existence of the last beast
on the planet, now could I?

05:58.129 --> 05:59.762
Well, at least
we still have that.

05:59.797 --> 06:01.130
Well, I'm glad you see
the glass as half full,

06:01.166 --> 06:02.498
Agent Chandler, because I nearly

06:02.534 --> 06:03.799
lost my life protecting you two.

06:03.834 --> 06:05.868
Now my career
is at risk, as well.

06:05.903 --> 06:07.736
And I'm not the only one.

06:10.808 --> 06:13.542
Major Fuller?

06:13.578 --> 06:15.544
My old C.O.
from Afghanistan.

06:15.580 --> 06:17.212
Colonel Fuller.

06:17.247 --> 06:19.381
Up for his
first star.

06:19.416 --> 06:21.283
With the Internet and media
digging into the Super Soldier

06:21.318 --> 06:23.452
program, well, he can kiss
his career good-bye, too.

06:23.487 --> 06:24.819
Why?

06:24.854 --> 06:26.388
Because he tried
to eliminate every soldier

06:26.423 --> 06:27.456
in his unit
who was experimented on.

06:27.491 --> 06:29.023
Including myself.

06:29.059 --> 06:30.225
I ran a background
on that sniper

06:30.260 --> 06:31.726
who attacked you
in your apartment.

06:31.761 --> 06:33.795
Turns out he was
formerly in Fuller's unit.

06:33.830 --> 06:36.231
So, you think Fuller's behind
these attacks on me?

06:36.266 --> 06:37.135
Why would he wait till now?

06:37.159 --> 06:39.082
I don't know,
but he's killed beasts before.

06:39.236 --> 06:40.702
He's got a lot more
at stake right now,

06:40.737 --> 06:42.403
so it just makes sense
he'd do it again.

06:42.438 --> 06:44.138
But if Fuller ordered a hit
on an American citizen,

06:44.173 --> 06:46.074
can't DHS arrest him?
Not without proof.

06:46.109 --> 06:48.881
How do we get it?
<i>We</i> don't.

06:48.882 --> 06:49.481
Sir...

06:49.505 --> 06:51.126
Look, I want to put
an end to this

06:51.127 --> 06:52.988
as much as you both
do, and if I had

06:52.989 --> 06:54.289
an undercover agent on the base

06:54.325 --> 06:55.757
with a TMSI catcher device,

06:55.792 --> 06:57.658
I could scan
the military supercomputer,

06:57.694 --> 06:59.493
find a record of this covert op
against Vincent.

06:59.529 --> 07:01.196
But, since you're
under investigation

07:01.231 --> 07:03.531
for helping us out,
we're on our own, right?

07:03.566 --> 07:04.963
Exactly.

07:04.964 --> 07:06.685
Get us the device.
We'll make it happen.

07:15.406 --> 07:16.589
VINCENT:
<i>There is no way I'm gonna</i>

07:16.590 --> 07:19.024
break into my old military base.

07:19.060 --> 07:20.726
Why not?
I'm still a DHS agent.

07:20.762 --> 07:22.194
We can use my clearance
to get you onto the base,

07:22.230 --> 07:23.495
and then you take
it from there.

07:23.530 --> 07:24.663
"Take it from there"?

07:24.698 --> 07:26.198
Okay, that is
the whole damn thing.

07:26.234 --> 07:28.234
Well, marriage is not
always 50/50, Vincent.

07:28.269 --> 07:29.668
I do the majority
of the cooking.

07:29.703 --> 07:31.069
Yeah, true,
and I love your pot roast.

07:31.104 --> 07:32.804
But to get
into the supercomputer,

07:32.839 --> 07:34.406
I'd have to break
into the command center,

07:34.441 --> 07:35.874
which is like Fort Knox

07:35.909 --> 07:38.477
in the middle
of a military base.

07:38.512 --> 07:39.711
And no one gets in or out

07:39.747 --> 07:40.912
without high-level
military clearance.

07:40.947 --> 07:42.514
Do you know anyone who has that?

07:42.549 --> 07:44.983
Come on, you know I do,
all right?

07:45.018 --> 07:48.319
But Fuller is not gonna
be happy to see me.

07:48.354 --> 07:50.155
And I'm certainly not gonna
be happy to see him.

07:50.190 --> 07:53.491
Catherine, you're asking me
to confront my past,

07:53.526 --> 07:56.094
which I don't know
if I can handle right now.

07:56.129 --> 07:57.996
I'm not asking you
to do it alone.

07:58.031 --> 08:01.532
Vincent, we can do anything
if we do it together.

08:01.567 --> 08:03.487
Yeah, well, they say
marriage changes everything.

08:04.570 --> 08:07.171
Almost everything.

08:07.206 --> 08:10.040
I'm pretty sure
someone's tailing us.

08:12.211 --> 08:14.578
(tires screech)

08:14.614 --> 08:15.879
Go, go, go, go, go!

08:15.915 --> 08:17.381
VINCENT:
Oh, come on.

08:17.417 --> 08:19.049
Is it that news reporter?

08:19.084 --> 08:21.118
She must've been
following Hill.

08:21.153 --> 08:23.086
Okay, watch this.

08:23.122 --> 08:25.122
(tires screech)

08:25.157 --> 08:27.925
(car horns honking)

08:35.400 --> 08:37.600
I can't shake her.

08:37.635 --> 08:40.035
Well, you said we can do
anything together, right?

08:40.071 --> 08:42.004
Watch this.
What--?

08:47.479 --> 08:48.978
I've been tailing Hill
for two days,

08:49.013 --> 08:51.781
and all I've got is a car
registered to the NYPD?

08:51.817 --> 08:53.149
That doesn't scream
news at 11:00!

08:53.184 --> 08:55.517
I need something
that screams-- aah!

09:07.698 --> 09:10.065
That worked.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.900
See? There's nothing
we can't handle together.

09:11.935 --> 09:13.602
Right, now all
that's left to do is

09:13.637 --> 09:15.604
break onto my old military base,

09:15.639 --> 09:18.106
confront my past, and take down
the very heavily armed man

09:18.141 --> 09:19.641
who's trying to kill me.

09:19.677 --> 09:21.977
Piece of cake.

09:23.604 --> 09:27.604
<b><font color="#00FF00">♪ Beauty and the Beast 4x06 ♪</font></b>

09:39.237 --> 09:40.503
Stop worrying.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.986
We're gonna be fine.

09:42.195 --> 09:45.349
Hill sent us the TMSI device
and a forged pass

09:45.350 --> 09:46.883
onto your old military base.

09:46.918 --> 09:48.760
Oh, what? So I don't
have to jump the fence?

09:48.761 --> 09:50.988
Must be my lucky day.

09:51.022 --> 09:52.083
I did it!

09:52.084 --> 09:53.484
I snuck into your apartment,
I picked up

09:53.519 --> 09:55.052
Vincent's old uniform,

09:55.087 --> 09:56.620
I made sure I wasn't followed.

09:56.656 --> 09:58.055
I even had Kyle double park

09:58.090 --> 09:59.289
'cause it's, like,
way less suspicious

09:59.325 --> 10:00.390
than actually finding a space.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.059
Wait, Heather, you brought Kyle?

10:02.094 --> 10:02.893
We have reporters

10:02.928 --> 10:04.228
following us.

10:04.263 --> 10:06.063
Not to mention assassins
and bounty hunters.

10:06.098 --> 10:07.931
The last thing we need
is your EMT boyfriend

10:07.967 --> 10:09.599
sniffing around
asking questions.

10:09.634 --> 10:10.767
Give me some credit, you guys.

10:10.802 --> 10:11.802
Kyle's so excited

10:11.837 --> 10:13.136
about us going away together,

10:13.172 --> 10:14.404
the only question
he's asking is,

10:14.439 --> 10:15.972
"Does the hotel have
room service?"

10:16.007 --> 10:18.140
Because the only thing getting
"exposed" this weekend is...

10:18.176 --> 10:19.809
Okay, got it! Thank you.

10:19.845 --> 10:20.943
Have fun. Use a condom.

10:20.979 --> 10:21.979
Hey, no. Hold on!

10:22.013 --> 10:23.145
You two dragged me out here,

10:23.181 --> 10:24.748
at least tell me
what the big plan is.

10:26.618 --> 10:29.151
Vincent's just, uh, going

10:29.187 --> 10:30.520
to see an old friend.

10:30.555 --> 10:32.255
Oh, yeah, real fun guy.

10:32.290 --> 10:33.622
Former commanding officer,
Colonel Fuller.

10:33.657 --> 10:34.656
You know, we'll probably
have a drink

10:34.692 --> 10:35.758
or two in the Officer's Lounge.

10:35.793 --> 10:37.760
Nothing like
12-year-old Scotch

10:37.795 --> 10:39.595
after a day of killing
your own men.

10:39.630 --> 10:41.163
What?
Not to dwell on the past.

10:41.199 --> 10:43.199
The important thing
is what Colonel Fuller

10:43.234 --> 10:44.666
can do for our future.

10:44.702 --> 10:46.502
Yeah, like stop trying
to kill me.

10:49.172 --> 10:50.506
Okay, uh, whatever you guys

10:50.541 --> 10:53.174
aren't telling me
sounds really dangerous.

10:53.210 --> 10:55.611
Which is exactly why it's better
that you know nothing about it.

10:55.646 --> 10:57.446
Not knowing doesn't make me
worry any less.

10:57.481 --> 10:59.314
But it makes you less
of an exposure risk.

10:59.349 --> 11:01.316
Heather, you knew
this was an issue

11:01.351 --> 11:03.184
when you started dating Kyle.
I know.

11:03.220 --> 11:05.520
(sighs) Fine, okay.

11:05.555 --> 11:07.789
I'll worry about not telling
Kyle what I don't know,

11:07.824 --> 11:09.991
and you worry about Vincent.

11:10.027 --> 11:12.860
There's something going on
with him.

11:18.902 --> 11:20.335
You think it still fits?

11:20.370 --> 11:22.036
Sure.

11:22.071 --> 11:24.839
12 years later,
it's like nothing ever changed.

11:24.874 --> 11:25.706
You've changed.

11:25.742 --> 11:27.542
You sure about that?

11:27.577 --> 11:29.209
Yeah. Yes.

11:29.245 --> 11:30.377
Fuller might be the same man

11:30.413 --> 11:32.146
that he was 12 years ago,

11:32.181 --> 11:34.248
but you aren't.

11:34.283 --> 11:36.216
What's bothering you so
much about this?

11:36.252 --> 11:38.552
It's not like we haven't faced
threats from the past before.

11:38.587 --> 11:40.020
Catherine, Fuller is different.

11:40.056 --> 11:41.588
Those guys in my unit,

11:41.623 --> 11:42.689
they're like family.

11:42.724 --> 11:43.723
I trusted them implicitly.

11:43.759 --> 11:44.759
Especially Fuller.

11:44.793 --> 11:45.859
But he betrayed you.

11:45.894 --> 11:46.894
He stared right at me,

11:46.929 --> 11:48.996
and he pulled the trigger.

11:49.031 --> 11:51.231
I was in so much shock I didn't
even know if I could run.

11:51.267 --> 11:52.433
And now the possibility

11:52.468 --> 11:54.335
of coming face to face

11:54.370 --> 11:56.002
with him again...

11:56.037 --> 11:57.370
What if I can't
control my feelings,

11:57.405 --> 11:58.905
what if I turn back

11:58.941 --> 12:00.507
into that beast I once was.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.709
I won't let that happen.

12:02.744 --> 12:04.544
You're not gonna be there
to stop it.

12:04.580 --> 12:07.981
Maybe I can be, with JT's help.

12:09.918 --> 12:11.884
JT:
<i>I can't do this!</i>

12:11.919 --> 12:14.720
You always say that, and then
you kill a ninja or something

12:14.755 --> 12:16.022
and get to
the next level.

12:16.057 --> 12:17.523
I'm not playing
a video game, Tess.

12:17.558 --> 12:19.092
Cat asked me to hack

12:19.127 --> 12:21.127
into the military satellite
surveillance system

12:21.162 --> 12:23.562
so she can help Vincent sneak
onto his old military base.

12:23.598 --> 12:24.797
Are you serious?

12:24.832 --> 12:26.565
And guess how she ended
her text?

12:26.601 --> 12:28.033
"Remember to stay
off the radar."

12:28.068 --> 12:31.269
The military surveillance system
is the radar!

12:31.305 --> 12:33.105
Oh, my God.

12:33.140 --> 12:34.640
What?

12:34.675 --> 12:35.741
I think I did something.

12:35.776 --> 12:37.209
What? JT, what did you do?

12:37.244 --> 12:39.211
I got Cat access to every
security camera

12:39.246 --> 12:40.646
and surveillance drone

12:40.681 --> 12:42.615
the army has.
I did it.

12:42.650 --> 12:43.916
I did the impossible!

12:43.951 --> 12:45.283
JT, that's amazing.

12:51.325 --> 12:53.892
Sorry, sorry.

12:53.927 --> 12:56.661
Well, that was familiar.

12:56.696 --> 12:57.662
Yeah, which is bad.

12:57.697 --> 12:59.498
Heather's right.

12:59.533 --> 13:00.798
Like, we're stuck here,

13:00.834 --> 13:02.333
we're falling into old habits.

13:02.368 --> 13:04.068
Something has to change.

13:04.103 --> 13:05.403
(phone ringing)
Yeah, but...

13:07.440 --> 13:09.273
Who is it?
Unknown caller.

13:09.308 --> 13:10.642
(ringing stops)

13:10.677 --> 13:12.309
Vincent said
not to answer the phone.

13:12.345 --> 13:14.311
Yeah, but what
if it's Grace Rose.

13:14.347 --> 13:16.280
Or better yet, the Beast Buyer.

13:16.315 --> 13:17.848
(phone ringing)

13:17.883 --> 13:20.184
Uh, Professor Forbes's
office. Uh, please hold.

13:20.219 --> 13:21.352
What did you do that for?

13:21.387 --> 13:23.654
Like I said,
something has to change.

13:24.723 --> 13:26.157
Go on.

13:28.394 --> 13:29.860
(clears throat)

13:29.895 --> 13:32.096
This is Professor Forbes,
can I help you?

13:34.332 --> 13:35.832
Uh, interesting.

13:35.868 --> 13:38.435
Let me check my schedule.

13:39.404 --> 13:40.336
It's nothing.

13:40.372 --> 13:41.972
Somebody named
Dr. Paretti

13:42.007 --> 13:44.608
wants to interview me
for a job at Tanirushi.

13:44.643 --> 13:47.110
Tanirushi?
Yeah.

13:47.145 --> 13:49.512
Why would the number one
biotech company in the world

13:49.548 --> 13:50.980
want to hire you?
A minute ago you,

13:51.015 --> 13:53.216
were hugging me
and calling me Mr. Amazing.

13:53.251 --> 13:55.151
JT, I never called you that,
not even when we were dating.

13:55.187 --> 13:57.720
I mean, please, a hot job
offer out of the blue?

13:57.755 --> 13:58.955
It's got to be a trap.

14:00.358 --> 14:02.024
(scoffs) Give me this.
No.

14:02.060 --> 14:04.527
Mr. Forbes will meet you at
Il Cantuccio in one hour.

14:04.563 --> 14:05.995
Thank you.

14:06.030 --> 14:07.296
Stop doing that!

14:07.331 --> 14:09.198
You don't want
to hug me again, fine,

14:09.233 --> 14:11.200
but having me killed
is not the answer.

14:11.235 --> 14:13.636
JT, this could be our
opportunity to find

14:13.671 --> 14:15.071
the Beast Buyer and move
on with our lives, okay?

14:15.106 --> 14:16.338
All you have to do
is wear a wire,

14:16.373 --> 14:17.907
and I'll provide backup.

14:17.942 --> 14:19.241
The last time I went undercover,

14:19.276 --> 14:21.043
I got beaten up by nerds.

14:21.079 --> 14:22.645
Well, I got you this time.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.525
(sighs)

14:38.129 --> 14:40.996
Captain Chandler?

14:41.031 --> 14:43.031
Yes, sir. That's me.

14:46.603 --> 14:49.104
(sighs)

14:49.139 --> 14:51.439
Captain Chandler? Really?

14:51.474 --> 14:53.875
It's customary upon marrying
to take the spouse's name.

14:53.910 --> 14:55.209
Well, let's hope the spouse

14:55.245 --> 14:56.844
got the paperwork right.

14:56.879 --> 14:58.912
Otherwise, I'll be
the late Captain Chandler.

15:06.722 --> 15:08.055
Sir?

15:08.090 --> 15:09.223
Yes.

15:11.594 --> 15:13.027
Parking's straight ahead.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.072
All right, coach.

15:25.107 --> 15:26.239
Now what?

15:26.275 --> 15:28.075
Head over to the admin building.

15:28.110 --> 15:29.876
I'll have Colonel Fuller called
into the Base Command.

15:29.911 --> 15:32.546
You break into his office,
steal his key card.

15:32.581 --> 15:34.281
You don't even have
to see each other.

15:34.316 --> 15:36.783
Wow, sounds like
you thought of everything.

15:36.818 --> 15:39.319
Here we go.

15:39.354 --> 15:41.488
Turn around
and put your hands up now!

15:41.523 --> 15:43.456
Catherine?

15:44.793 --> 15:46.993
Take it down a notch.
Agent Chandler,

15:47.028 --> 15:48.761
I'm Agent Murphy,
this is Agent Tran,

15:48.797 --> 15:50.496
DHS Internal Affairs.

15:50.531 --> 15:52.264
I think there's been a mistake.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.733
We need to talk,

15:53.768 --> 15:54.867
now.

15:57.672 --> 16:00.639
Catherine.

16:00.675 --> 16:02.908
(soldiers counting)

16:02.943 --> 16:05.511
Catherine, come on.

16:05.546 --> 16:08.914
Catherine,
I can't do this without...

16:15.356 --> 16:17.596
FULLER: <i>Terminate the operation,</i>
<i>terminate the operation.</i>

16:20.894 --> 16:22.660
<i>Hunt them down!</i>
<i>Got one over here!</i>

16:22.696 --> 16:23.829
(gunshots)
(grunts)

16:28.869 --> 16:30.602
Major Fuller, what's going on?

16:38.144 --> 16:40.044
<i>Terminate the operation.</i>

16:40.079 --> 16:42.179
(panting)

16:44.083 --> 16:46.284
SOLDIER: Are you gonna
do another tour after this?

16:50.957 --> 16:54.725
Catherine, if you can hear me,
I need you.

16:54.761 --> 16:57.661
(sighs)
I need you right now.

16:57.696 --> 17:00.497
SOLDIER 2:
That's his job.

17:08.719 --> 17:10.352
All right, Catherine, new plan.

17:11.075 --> 17:12.340
Fuller's
got the key card on him,

17:12.376 --> 17:14.609
so I'm gonna have to go
after him.

17:14.646 --> 17:16.211
Alone.

17:16.247 --> 17:17.680
'Cause now I'm talking
to myself.

17:17.714 --> 17:19.348
No one can hear me.

17:21.752 --> 17:23.585
Guys, I have
a very full schedule.

17:23.619 --> 17:25.054
Then I'll get
to the point.

17:25.089 --> 17:27.423
What is your husband's
relationship to DHS?

17:27.458 --> 17:30.092
My husband's a doctor.

17:30.127 --> 17:33.262
He has nothing to do with DHS.
We have a full schedule, too.

17:33.297 --> 17:35.431
Let's not play games.
We know Vincent Keller

17:35.466 --> 17:37.399
is a lot more
than just a doctor.

17:38.335 --> 17:40.268
I can explain.

17:40.303 --> 17:42.637
Deputy Secretary Hill
already did.

17:42.673 --> 17:45.139
That's why the secretary put
him in charge of the case.

17:45.175 --> 17:47.576
What case?

17:47.611 --> 17:49.477
Stopping a potential
domestic terrorist.

17:49.512 --> 17:52.380
Hill confessed that he has
been covering something up.

17:53.850 --> 17:55.249
Your husband's PTSD.

17:57.087 --> 18:00.121
Vincent Keller is
a mentally unstable war vet

18:00.156 --> 18:01.855
who may be a danger
to his country.

18:07.697 --> 18:09.097
JT:
<i>Tell me again why this time</i>

18:09.132 --> 18:10.164
is gonna be different?

18:10.200 --> 18:12.165
You know, I've been used as bait

18:12.201 --> 18:14.768
for bad guys before,
and it never ends well for me.

18:14.804 --> 18:15.970
Kidnapped, beaten up,

18:16.005 --> 18:17.605
hung from the ceiling, twice.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.272
Any of this ringing a bell?

18:19.308 --> 18:20.841
JT, that's all
in the past, okay?

18:20.876 --> 18:22.309
Except now,
if you get your ass kicked,

18:22.344 --> 18:24.244
it's in front
of your ex-girlfriend.

18:24.279 --> 18:26.680
Very funny. You know, maybe I
should get my coffee to go.

18:26.716 --> 18:28.582
Uh, joke, okay? Relax.

18:28.617 --> 18:30.083
I've got unis

18:30.119 --> 18:31.351
in the front and the back.

18:31.386 --> 18:32.852
If this so-called "Dr. Paretti"

18:32.887 --> 18:34.654
turns out to be
another vicious bounty hunter

18:34.689 --> 18:35.922
looking for Intel on Vincent,

18:35.957 --> 18:37.457
I've got you covered.

18:37.493 --> 18:40.793
Weirdly, that doesn't
make me feel better.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.295
Look, just chill out.

18:42.331 --> 18:43.963
Look for anybody
who looks like a killer.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.999
I don't even know
what a killer looks like.

18:50.739 --> 18:52.005
Excuse me,

18:52.040 --> 18:53.506
are you JT Forbes?

18:56.377 --> 18:57.944
Aline Paretti,

18:57.979 --> 19:00.046
bio-technology
at Tanirushi.

19:00.081 --> 19:01.614
I've read all of
your research,

19:01.649 --> 19:03.682
and I'm so excited
to meet you!

19:03.717 --> 19:05.518
I'm excited, too.

19:05.553 --> 19:06.985
I said "killer"
not "killer body".

19:07.021 --> 19:09.021
JT, get out of there;
this is clearly a trap.

19:09.056 --> 19:10.656
This is an unexpected surprise.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.392
I mean,

19:13.427 --> 19:16.562
I wasn't expecting someone
so young.

19:16.597 --> 19:17.863
But just to be clear,

19:17.898 --> 19:19.131
Dr. Pretty...

19:19.166 --> 19:21.133
Paretti.
Right.

19:21.168 --> 19:22.901
Is this an actual
job interview?

19:22.936 --> 19:24.136
I'd hate to waste time

19:24.171 --> 19:28.140
if Tanirushi and you

19:28.175 --> 19:29.841
aren't really interested in me.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.242
Professor Forbes,

19:31.278 --> 19:33.311
your thesis
on cytokine fusion proteins

19:33.346 --> 19:35.913
is exactly what Tanirushi
is looking for.

19:35.948 --> 19:38.583
"Interested" is
an understatement.

19:38.618 --> 19:40.151
Fantastic.

19:40.187 --> 19:41.619
Please, have a seat.

19:45.592 --> 19:48.859
So, tell me how you see
our future together.

19:48.895 --> 19:50.395
And talk slow.

19:50.430 --> 19:52.196
(laughter)

19:58.270 --> 20:00.171
(grunting)

20:04.243 --> 20:06.744
You looking for this?

20:06.779 --> 20:08.778
I don't actually need it.

20:08.814 --> 20:11.381
In case you forgot,
I'm pretty dangerous on my own.

20:11.417 --> 20:12.849
Vincent Keller?

20:14.220 --> 20:15.752
What are you doing here?

20:15.787 --> 20:17.221
Trying to figure out
why you sent an assassin,

20:17.256 --> 20:19.590
and then a team
of snipers to kill me.

20:19.625 --> 20:22.726
Come on, Colonel,
what was next-- ground troops?

20:22.761 --> 20:24.360
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:24.395 --> 20:25.795
I didn't send anyone to kill you.
Really?

20:25.831 --> 20:28.297
So now you're
a murderer and a liar?

20:28.333 --> 20:30.100
Neither.

20:30.135 --> 20:31.634
Trust me, Keller,
if I wanted you dead

20:31.669 --> 20:33.569
then or now,
I'd have it done.

20:33.605 --> 20:37.273
Right back at you, Colonel.

20:38.110 --> 20:40.276
Move. Move!

20:40.311 --> 20:43.078
CATHERINE:
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

20:43.114 --> 20:45.447
There's no basis to Hill's claim
that Vincent

20:45.482 --> 20:47.815
has PTSD or that he's
a terrorist threat.

20:47.851 --> 20:50.452
Deputy Secretary Hill said that
when Agent Russo was murdered,

20:50.487 --> 20:52.454
your husband became agitated

20:52.489 --> 20:54.623
and seemed to take
the case personally.

20:54.658 --> 20:56.291
Vincent knew Agent Russo.

20:56.326 --> 20:58.926
He was concerned that the murder
was part of something

20:58.962 --> 21:00.628
larger.

21:00.663 --> 21:02.930
Concerned or paranoid?
What does that mean?

21:02.966 --> 21:04.665
It means that your husband,
the ordinary doctor,

21:04.700 --> 21:07.101
somehow got it in his head
that the killer was after him.

21:07.137 --> 21:08.435
It's textbook PTSD.

21:08.471 --> 21:10.004
It's all in the
file that Hill gave us.

21:10.039 --> 21:12.273
No, it's definitely
not all in this file.

21:12.308 --> 21:14.408
Oh, then let's hear your
husband's side of the story.

21:14.443 --> 21:16.710
Where is Vincent right now?

21:18.614 --> 21:20.614
MURPHY:
<i>Hill confessed that...</i>

21:20.650 --> 21:22.015
TRAN: <i>Right there in the file</i>
<i>that Hill gave</i> us...

21:22.050 --> 21:23.950
If I had an undercover
agent on the base

21:23.986 --> 21:25.252
with a TMSI catcher device...

21:25.288 --> 21:27.454
Oh, my God,
I have to stop Vincent.

21:27.490 --> 21:28.855
Why?
What's he gonna do?

21:28.891 --> 21:31.091
I don't know,
but Hill set Vincent up.

21:31.126 --> 21:32.660
So if you want
to protect innocent lives,

21:32.695 --> 21:34.460
you have to let me warn Vincent

21:34.496 --> 21:36.429
that he is walking into a trap.

21:46.208 --> 21:48.842
VINCENT: You are gonna grant me
access to computer HQ,

21:48.877 --> 21:50.476
now keep moving.

21:50.512 --> 21:53.279
You're making
a mistake, Keller.

21:53.315 --> 21:56.649
Bigger than the mistake I
made trusting you, Colonel?

22:19.106 --> 22:21.673
Start downloading now.

22:24.678 --> 22:27.746
You can check
every computer on this base.

22:27.781 --> 22:30.181
You will not find evidence
that I put a hit out on you,

22:30.217 --> 22:32.183
because it does not exist.

22:32.219 --> 22:33.385
Really?

22:33.420 --> 22:35.821
So 12 years ago,

22:35.856 --> 22:38.256
you killed an entire
platoon of your own men

22:38.291 --> 22:40.758
and you expect me to believe
what you've got to say?

22:40.793 --> 22:42.827
12 years ago,
I was following orders.

22:42.863 --> 22:44.495
You murdered soldiers.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.231
It was a military operation.

22:46.266 --> 22:47.832
They were your men!

22:47.868 --> 22:49.934
And my friends, my platoon.

22:49.970 --> 22:51.435
Failed experiments.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.271
They were dangers
to their country.

22:53.306 --> 22:54.672
I was ordered
to terminate the operation,

22:54.707 --> 22:56.474
before it got out of control!

23:02.982 --> 23:06.350
You should've killed me
when you had the chance,

23:06.386 --> 23:08.185
because now you're
gonna get to see

23:08.220 --> 23:11.021
what it really looks like
when I'm out of control.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.956
I did have a chance
to shoot you.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.524
I had a clear shot.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.193
And yet,
you're still alive.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.195
You think I missed?

23:18.230 --> 23:21.631
Stop lying to me.

23:21.666 --> 23:24.134
I never disobeyed
an order until that day.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.370
Stop lying to me!

23:26.405 --> 23:28.238
You were better
than the others, Vincent.

23:28.274 --> 23:29.706
There was still good in you.

23:29.741 --> 23:30.907
Whatever had been
done to you,

23:30.942 --> 23:33.242
I knew the man you'd been.

23:33.278 --> 23:36.212
The man maybe you
could still be.

23:37.582 --> 23:40.383
That man didn't deserve to die.

23:43.688 --> 23:46.422
(gunfire)
(soldiers clamoring)

24:08.612 --> 24:10.646
No, because if you're,

24:10.681 --> 24:12.648
you're telling the truth--

24:12.683 --> 24:13.715
I am, and you know it.

24:15.118 --> 24:16.485
Whoever's trying
to kill you now,

24:16.520 --> 24:17.653
it isn't me.

24:17.688 --> 24:19.654
(rapid beeping)

24:24.694 --> 24:26.261
Get out of here!

24:26.296 --> 24:27.296
Go! Get out of here!

24:27.331 --> 24:29.130
Go! Go!

24:41.538 --> 24:43.004
(alarm blaring)

24:43.040 --> 24:44.973
(knocks echoing)

24:50.680 --> 24:53.581
(coughing)

25:03.993 --> 25:05.125
(Fuller groaning)

25:22.878 --> 25:24.511
The system's on lockdown!

25:24.546 --> 25:26.012
We need an explosives unit, now!

25:26.047 --> 25:28.214
Vincent.

25:28.249 --> 25:30.383
Looks like he set off some
kind of explosive device.

25:30.418 --> 25:32.218
TRAN:
Typical suicide bombing.

25:32.253 --> 25:33.933
Actually there are
no confirmed casualties.

25:35.190 --> 25:36.356
At least not yet.

25:36.391 --> 25:38.358
No thanks to you.

25:38.393 --> 25:39.892
Agent Chandler...
You planted

25:39.927 --> 25:41.427
that bomb on Vincent.

25:41.463 --> 25:42.862
We saved your life,
and you tried to kill him.

25:42.897 --> 25:45.498
I warned DHS,
because I wanted to stop him.

25:45.533 --> 25:46.499
Vincent is a
dangerous man.

25:46.534 --> 25:48.167
CATHERINE:
That is a lie.

25:48.203 --> 25:49.568
You know he's not.

25:49.604 --> 25:51.670
I know what he is.

25:51.706 --> 25:53.939
Now, you're upset, obviously.

25:53.975 --> 25:57.776
But don't say anything
you might regret.

25:57.812 --> 26:00.345
DHS has all the information
they need on Vincent Keller

26:00.381 --> 26:02.280
for now.

26:02.316 --> 26:05.450
We trusted you.

26:05.486 --> 26:08.687
And I will do everything I can
to help you through your loss.

26:10.391 --> 26:11.856
Take her to DHS for debriefing.

26:21.468 --> 26:23.835
(alarm blaring)

26:28.508 --> 26:30.875
Hey, Keller, you got
to get out of here.

26:30.911 --> 26:32.243
That's an order.

26:32.278 --> 26:34.145
Yeah, well, I guess
neither one of us

26:34.180 --> 26:35.780
is good at following orders,
Colonel.

26:35.815 --> 26:38.550
Now, keep pressure on this.

26:38.585 --> 26:40.952
Okay? Otherwise you're
gonna bleed to death.

26:40.987 --> 26:43.087
You never walk away
from helping people.

26:43.122 --> 26:44.888
Even now.

26:45.791 --> 26:47.324
(groans)
Keller?

26:47.360 --> 26:49.993
Whoever set you up,

26:50.029 --> 26:51.962
they're not gonna stop.

26:51.997 --> 26:53.630
(thudding)
MAN: One, two, three!

26:55.168 --> 26:56.133
Damn it.

26:56.169 --> 26:57.234
Catherine...

26:57.270 --> 26:58.835
Go...

26:58.871 --> 27:00.137
Go!

27:00.173 --> 27:02.272
MAN:
Stand back!

27:02.307 --> 27:03.941
We're gonna blow the door!

27:03.976 --> 27:05.308
PARETTI:
I'm not letting you get away.

27:05.343 --> 27:06.476
(phone buzzing)

27:06.511 --> 27:08.010
I don't know
what other companies

27:08.046 --> 27:09.912
are courting you, right now,
but Tanirushi is prepared

27:09.948 --> 27:11.814
to make you a sizeable offer.

27:11.849 --> 27:13.816
I like how you say "sizeable."

27:13.851 --> 27:14.851
(both laughing)

27:14.886 --> 27:15.952
That's enough.

27:15.987 --> 27:16.987
Meeting's over.

27:17.021 --> 27:18.287
JT Forbes is not for sale.

27:18.322 --> 27:19.956
Since when?
Since I just got an alert

27:19.991 --> 27:21.857
that a bomb went off on a
military base, let's go.

27:21.893 --> 27:24.460
Oh, no!
Hey, she's got the check.

27:24.495 --> 27:26.595
(customers clamoring)

27:29.032 --> 27:31.032
And even more
unanswered questions today

27:31.068 --> 27:34.336
as a terrorist bomb
rips through a military base.

27:34.371 --> 27:37.606
No survivors have been
reported at this time.

27:37.641 --> 27:40.008
I'm Grace Rose, signing off.

27:40.043 --> 27:42.477
Good news, cleared my shifts
for the whole weekend.

27:42.512 --> 27:44.980
We are 100% good to go.

27:45.015 --> 27:46.180
I can't.

27:46.216 --> 27:48.783
What? Why?

27:48.819 --> 27:51.185
I don't know.

27:51.221 --> 27:52.721
Wait, okay?

27:52.756 --> 27:54.789
I tried to be understanding
about whatever

27:54.825 --> 27:56.724
is going on with you.

27:56.759 --> 27:59.193
But at some point, you're
gonna have to let me in.

27:59.229 --> 28:01.028
I-I get that, I do.

28:01.063 --> 28:03.664
I just... right now I'm
really worried about my sister

28:03.699 --> 28:07.001
and I have to go.
I'm so sorry.

28:07.036 --> 28:08.876
I know how much it sucks
to be out of the loop.

28:14.376 --> 28:16.010
Catherine!

28:16.045 --> 28:18.178
Catherine--
(grunts)

28:20.750 --> 28:23.283
I knew you'd come for her.

28:25.621 --> 28:27.487
You always do.

28:29.558 --> 28:31.691
Where is she?

28:31.726 --> 28:33.893
(grunts)

28:35.130 --> 28:36.329
Where is she?

28:51.360 --> 28:53.093
You're awake.

28:54.630 --> 28:57.631
Where am I?

28:57.666 --> 28:59.932
Homeland Security
sometimes finds it useful

28:59.968 --> 29:02.302
to question
suspected terrorists...

29:03.972 --> 29:06.005
...privately.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.908
Fine, you want
to question me?

29:08.943 --> 29:11.144
Go ahead, but I
am no terrorist.

29:11.179 --> 29:13.679
You set off a bomb
on a military base.

29:13.714 --> 29:17.016
A bomb you gave me!

29:17.051 --> 29:19.919
You tried to set me up
so I could kill Fuller.

29:19.954 --> 29:21.921
Colonel Fuller was
an unforeseen casualty.

29:21.956 --> 29:24.456
You, you were
the target, Vincent.

29:24.492 --> 29:26.092
A target that's turning out
to be pretty hard to kill.

29:26.127 --> 29:29.695
Catherine and I, we risked
everything to help you.

29:29.730 --> 29:31.830
You supposed to be
protecting us!

29:31.865 --> 29:33.432
I almost died for it.

29:33.467 --> 29:36.134
In front of my wife
and my daughter.

29:38.238 --> 29:40.673
Now I don't know who put
a bounty out on your head,

29:40.708 --> 29:42.140
but I told you and your wife

29:42.176 --> 29:44.575
to end this
before it blew back on me.

29:46.013 --> 29:47.378
My whole career is on the line.

29:47.414 --> 29:50.015
You beasting out is exactly

29:50.050 --> 29:51.316
what I need to prove
that I shot you

29:51.351 --> 29:53.718
in self-defense.

29:53.753 --> 29:55.353
This can't just look real.

29:56.824 --> 29:58.990
It has to be real.

29:59.026 --> 30:00.625
What the hell is that?

30:00.660 --> 30:01.892
Synthesized adrenaline.

30:01.928 --> 30:04.462
Should help you
overcome your control.

30:04.497 --> 30:08.333
My control is the only thing
keeping you alive right now.

30:09.336 --> 30:11.035
You really got no idea

30:11.070 --> 30:13.871
what I am
or what I'm capable of, do you?

30:13.906 --> 30:15.840
No.

30:15.875 --> 30:18.042
But you're going to show me.

30:18.077 --> 30:21.011
(groaning)

30:24.683 --> 30:25.916
You're making a huge mistake.

30:25.952 --> 30:27.318
I have to be with Vincent.

30:27.353 --> 30:29.186
You need to take
me to him.

30:29.222 --> 30:31.055
Your husband is
in DHS custody.

30:31.090 --> 30:33.357
Deputy Secretary Hill is in
charge of his questioning.

30:33.392 --> 30:35.058
Hill is not going
to question Vincent.

30:35.093 --> 30:36.693
He's going to kill him. Look.

30:36.729 --> 30:40.263
Listen to me. Deputy Secretary
Hill is in danger, too.

30:40.298 --> 30:41.998
He doesn't know
what Vincent is capable of.

30:42.033 --> 30:43.266
If Hill threatens Vincent,

30:43.301 --> 30:45.034
he's gonna have no choice but...

30:45.070 --> 30:46.703
No choice but to what,
Agent Chandler?

30:46.739 --> 30:47.739
You assured us that

30:47.773 --> 30:49.172
your husband wasn't dangerous.

30:49.207 --> 30:52.375
He can be, if I'm not with him.

30:53.411 --> 30:54.710
Even if we believed you

30:54.746 --> 30:56.679
about Hill,
it's not our call.

30:56.714 --> 30:58.014
I'm sorry, there's nothing

30:58.049 --> 30:59.548
we can do about it.

30:59.584 --> 31:00.917
I'm sorry, too.

31:06.224 --> 31:08.190
Do you realize what
you're doing, Agent Chandler?

31:08.225 --> 31:10.125
Hopefully saving Hill's life.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.260
Which is more

31:11.295 --> 31:12.495
than he'd ever do for Vincent.

31:15.833 --> 31:18.534
Drop the gun,
or I swear I'll shoot.

31:26.977 --> 31:29.111
(sighs)

31:34.351 --> 31:36.418
Cat!
Vincent?

31:36.453 --> 31:38.586
Where the hell are they?

31:38.622 --> 31:42.223
Not sure, but Vincent
didn't go willingly.

31:42.258 --> 31:43.725
Damn it, we should've...

31:43.760 --> 31:45.092
We should have been helping them

31:45.128 --> 31:46.928
instead of going
to that stupid fake interview.

31:46.963 --> 31:48.329
It wasn't fake.

31:48.364 --> 31:50.164
Trust me, JT, they were fake.

31:50.199 --> 31:53.601
Wow. Jealousy,
thy name is Tess.

31:53.637 --> 31:55.403
No, it's not.
Admit it,

31:55.439 --> 31:58.105
you talk like our relationship
is a dark part of the past,

31:58.141 --> 31:59.140
but the minute you thought
I was moving on,

31:59.175 --> 32:01.142
your feelings changed.

32:01.177 --> 32:02.910
What, you want me to admit
how I feel?

32:02.946 --> 32:05.646
Fine, yeah, I care about you.
I miss what we had.

32:05.681 --> 32:07.281
My feelings haven't changed.

32:07.317 --> 32:09.817
The problem is, neither have you.
What does that mean?

32:09.852 --> 32:13.186
JT, we broke up so that you
could find yourself, right?

32:13.221 --> 32:14.488
How's that going?

32:14.523 --> 32:16.256
(phone rings)

32:18.393 --> 32:19.793
Uh, Cat, are you okay?
Where's Vincent?

32:19.829 --> 32:20.994
That's what I need you
to find out.

32:21.029 --> 32:22.496
JT's on it.

32:22.531 --> 32:23.764
What the hell happened?

32:23.799 --> 32:25.332
Hill planted that bomb.

32:25.367 --> 32:26.867
He's the one who's been
trying to kill Vincent.

32:26.902 --> 32:28.869
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I thought Hill was on our side?

32:28.904 --> 32:30.670
Turns out the Feds suck.

32:30.705 --> 32:33.106
I just hope I can find Vincent
before it's too late.

32:33.141 --> 32:35.108
JT: Got him!
I tracked Vincent's earpiece

32:35.143 --> 32:36.376
to 62nd Street

32:36.411 --> 32:37.677
near the airport.

32:37.712 --> 32:39.179
You want Tess to send backup?

32:39.214 --> 32:41.814
(sirens wailing)
I think I'm bringing my own.

32:52.827 --> 32:55.461
(groaning)

32:55.497 --> 32:58.531
You really don't want
to do this, you know.

32:58.566 --> 33:00.332
I know.

33:00.368 --> 33:02.301
But I don't have a choice.

33:02.336 --> 33:04.669
No, no, no, we all
have a choice.

33:04.705 --> 33:06.071
You didn't.

33:06.107 --> 33:08.173
Someone made you
into... this.

33:08.209 --> 33:11.576
And someone's always gonna
want you dead because of it.

33:11.612 --> 33:12.711
(growls)
I'm just sorry

33:12.746 --> 33:14.313
that this time it had to be me.

33:19.887 --> 33:21.486
Run!

33:21.522 --> 33:23.354
Run!

33:23.390 --> 33:24.856
Get out of here
before it's too late.

33:24.892 --> 33:26.290
Go!

33:27.260 --> 33:28.527
I have to do this.

33:28.562 --> 33:30.094
I need to do this.

33:30.130 --> 33:31.563
(bellowing)

33:35.902 --> 33:37.735
Come on, Vincent,
attack me!

33:38.871 --> 33:40.571
Come on! Do it!

33:44.577 --> 33:46.344
What the hell?

33:47.780 --> 33:49.180
(gunshot)
Vincent!

33:58.957 --> 33:59.989
Vincent, don't!

34:01.626 --> 34:02.559
Please don't.

34:02.594 --> 34:03.693
Please don't do this!

34:05.096 --> 34:07.129
(neck snaps)

34:07.165 --> 34:08.364
No.

34:10.635 --> 34:12.268
(sirens approaching)

34:18.076 --> 34:19.875
No.

34:19.909 --> 34:21.510
(growling)
No. No.

34:23.981 --> 34:25.481
Stop!

34:25.516 --> 34:26.782
No, stop!

34:32.355 --> 34:34.623
We got a homicide.

34:34.658 --> 34:38.259
Suspect is on the run
and presumed dangerous.

34:53.815 --> 34:55.175
Does Vincent like bananas?

34:55.440 --> 34:57.106
Or maybe I should
make sandwiches.

34:57.141 --> 34:58.442
What do fugitives eat?

34:58.477 --> 35:00.043
Heather, it is a go bag,
not a picnic.

35:00.078 --> 35:01.744
Do you have any cash?

35:01.779 --> 35:03.612
Never mind.

35:03.648 --> 35:05.481
Vincent only needs to lay low

35:05.516 --> 35:06.983
until we figure out how
to get him a second chance.

35:07.018 --> 35:09.385
You mean a third?
Or fourth? Or maybe fifth.

35:09.420 --> 35:11.004
I mean, how do you
even keep count?

35:11.028 --> 35:12.156
Heather!

35:12.157 --> 35:13.723
Well, I'm sorry, it's just
I just can't believe

35:13.758 --> 35:14.924
that this is actually
happening again.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.226
And truthfully I didn't think

35:16.261 --> 35:17.293
that Vincent was capable

35:17.329 --> 35:19.061
of doing something like this.

35:19.096 --> 35:21.497
Cat, he murdered the Deputy
Secretary of Homeland Security.

35:21.532 --> 35:22.631
It was not his fault.

35:22.667 --> 35:24.166
Damn right, it wasn't.

35:24.201 --> 35:26.836
Apparently Hill pumped enough
synthetic adrenaline

35:26.871 --> 35:28.838
into Vincent to make an
elephant's heart explode.

35:28.873 --> 35:30.773
Is he gonna be okay?
I don't know.

35:30.808 --> 35:33.609
He might have a hard time
calming down, so...

35:33.644 --> 35:35.911
you should take this.

35:35.946 --> 35:37.645
He's not like that anymore.

35:37.681 --> 35:39.647
Sure about that?

35:41.952 --> 35:43.118
Okay.

35:43.153 --> 35:44.586
(phone ringing)

35:44.621 --> 35:47.322
Tess, did they find him?

35:47.358 --> 35:50.125
No, but DHS sent out

35:50.160 --> 35:52.159
an APB on Vincent
as a person of interest.

35:52.195 --> 35:53.461
Okay, then I still have time.

35:53.497 --> 35:54.696
Can you do me a favor?

35:54.731 --> 35:56.197
Divert the patrols away

35:56.232 --> 35:57.499
from the East River Overpass.

35:57.534 --> 35:58.933
If Vincent and I are
ever in trouble,

35:58.968 --> 36:00.101
that's our rendezvous point.

36:00.136 --> 36:01.770
Look, Cat, I know it's pointless

36:01.805 --> 36:03.004
to try to talk you out of this.

36:03.039 --> 36:04.939
The only reason
why you made bail

36:04.974 --> 36:06.674
is 'cause cops at the scene saw
that you couldn't have been

36:06.710 --> 36:08.510
involved in Hill's murder
or Vincent's escape.

36:08.544 --> 36:10.778
But if you're caught
helping a fugitive,

36:10.813 --> 36:13.114
you'll be charged as
an accomplice to everything.

36:13.149 --> 36:14.448
Including murder.

36:14.483 --> 36:16.817
I know.

36:16.852 --> 36:18.953
But I wasn't there for Vincent
when he needed me.

36:18.988 --> 36:20.288
I need to be there for him now.

36:20.323 --> 36:22.290
(sighs)

36:22.325 --> 36:23.857
All right.

36:23.893 --> 36:25.258
Just be careful, okay?

36:30.999 --> 36:32.966
I know it's safer
if I'm out of the loop,

36:33.001 --> 36:35.569
but you would tell me
if this was good-bye, right?

36:35.604 --> 36:38.204
Of course I would, Heather.

36:39.508 --> 36:40.740
GRACE:
Catherine Chandler?

36:40.775 --> 36:42.309
Grace Rose, I'm investigating

36:42.344 --> 36:44.483
DHS cover-ups involving
Deputy Secretary Hill.

36:44.484 --> 36:45.680
You work for him, right?

36:45.681 --> 36:46.491
No comment.

36:46.515 --> 36:47.939
DHS refused
to issue a statement

36:47.940 --> 36:50.340
about the terrorist bombing.
Any thoughts on that?

36:50.376 --> 36:52.409
Well, it's an ongoing
investigation, so no comment.

36:52.444 --> 36:53.577
Well, I heard that certain
details

36:53.612 --> 36:54.845
about the bomber

36:54.881 --> 36:56.213
exonerated
Deputy Secretary Hill.

36:56.249 --> 36:58.315
He's been unreachable
ever since.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.849
You wouldn't happen
to know where he is,

36:59.885 --> 37:01.985
or what might have
happened to him?

37:02.020 --> 37:03.987
Hey, lady, what part of "no
comment" don't you understand?

37:04.022 --> 37:06.490
I understand that's what people
say when they know something.

37:08.527 --> 37:10.226
By the way,
where's your husband?

37:14.732 --> 37:17.000
Unless you want to become
a headline yourself,

37:17.035 --> 37:19.002
stay away from me
and my husband.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.403
I just go where the story is.

37:24.309 --> 37:25.508
Let's go.

37:25.543 --> 37:28.544
(engine starts)

37:28.579 --> 37:30.913
And don't lose her
this time.

37:33.451 --> 37:35.584
(stalling)

37:35.585 --> 37:37.618
I guess Grace Rose
is gonna have to do a report

37:37.654 --> 37:39.220
on the weather instead.

37:39.255 --> 37:40.889
I hear it's raining bananas.

37:46.029 --> 37:47.395
(sighs)

37:48.631 --> 37:50.231
You stuck bananas

37:50.266 --> 37:53.467
up Grace Rose's tail pipe?

37:53.503 --> 37:55.336
Where'd you learn that,
<i>Beverly Hills Cop?</i>

37:55.371 --> 37:58.138
Never heard of it.

37:58.174 --> 38:02.410
Classic movie
starring Eddie Murphy?

38:02.445 --> 38:03.577
He was the Donkey from <i>Shrek.</i>

38:03.612 --> 38:05.079
You know what? Forget it.

38:05.114 --> 38:06.914
Wherever you got the idea,
it was a good one.

38:06.949 --> 38:08.782
Just trying to help.

38:32.974 --> 38:34.407
Vincent?

38:36.911 --> 38:39.178
(growling)

38:46.721 --> 38:47.854
(gasps)

38:55.730 --> 38:58.297
I'm so sorry.

38:58.332 --> 39:00.031
Everything's gonna be okay.

39:01.335 --> 39:03.235
Really? How?

39:03.271 --> 39:06.538
After what I just did,
what I just became?

39:06.574 --> 39:08.340
Hill didn't give you
much of a choice.

39:08.376 --> 39:09.741
Maybe if I had been there...

39:09.777 --> 39:11.709
No, don't.

39:11.745 --> 39:14.179
You couldn't have stopped me.

39:14.214 --> 39:15.480
I couldn't stop myself.

39:15.515 --> 39:17.849
That wasn't you. You know that.

39:19.586 --> 39:22.553
(sighs)

39:22.589 --> 39:23.721
Vincent, what are we gonna do?

39:23.757 --> 39:26.557
I don't know.

39:26.593 --> 39:29.226
I really don't.

39:29.262 --> 39:32.430
We'll find a way, okay?

39:32.465 --> 39:34.766
We've been through worse, right?

39:34.801 --> 39:37.034
Yeah.

39:37.069 --> 39:39.170
Yeah, I wish that were true.

39:44.777 --> 39:46.376
I'm never letting you go,

39:46.412 --> 39:48.444
so we got to find a way,
all right?

39:48.479 --> 39:50.814
