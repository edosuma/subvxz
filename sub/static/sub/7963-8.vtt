00:04.534 --> 00:05.783
Honey.

00:05.868 --> 00:08.402
Hmm?

00:08.488 --> 00:11.071
Honey, honey, honey.

00:17.663 --> 00:19.213
McQuade.

00:21.083 --> 00:22.166
Yeah. Put him on.

00:22.251 --> 00:23.751
Not tonight.

00:25.588 --> 00:27.254
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

00:29.058 --> 00:30.424
He's what?

00:32.512 --> 00:34.061
Sweet mother of God.

00:34.096 --> 00:36.147
His name is Josh Greenberg.

00:36.232 --> 00:38.732
Last week, he tried to kiss a
girl he works with named Rosa.

00:38.768 --> 00:40.851
She turned him down.
Now he wants to text her.

00:40.937 --> 00:42.236
What does the text say?

00:42.271 --> 00:45.523
"You up? Wanna hang?"

00:45.608 --> 00:48.409
I know. His finger's on the button.

00:48.444 --> 00:52.279
Christ. Is he drunk?

00:52.365 --> 00:53.697
They always are.

00:56.452 --> 00:58.536
Your show, McQuade.

00:58.621 --> 01:00.454
Josh!

01:00.506 --> 01:03.257
My name is Lieutenant
McQuade. I just want to talk.

01:03.292 --> 01:05.376
Well, I'm all done talking, man!

01:05.461 --> 01:08.929
I know you're in a bad
spot. But use your head.

01:08.965 --> 01:11.966
It's 2:00 a.m. on a Saturday.

01:12.018 --> 01:14.268
How do you think this is gonna play out?

01:14.303 --> 01:16.353
Rosa's gonna read that
text as a booty call

01:16.439 --> 01:17.771
and think you're creepy.

01:17.807 --> 01:19.356
Hey! Don't come any closer!

01:19.442 --> 01:21.058
I'll send it. I swear
to God I'll send it.

01:21.143 --> 01:22.943
Okay, okay, okay! You're
in control, brother.

01:22.979 --> 01:24.895
You're in control.

01:24.981 --> 01:25.946
Snipers in position.

01:29.318 --> 01:31.952
We got a clear shot.

01:31.988 --> 01:33.120
No.

01:33.155 --> 01:35.539
Hold your fire.

01:35.625 --> 01:37.124
Let me try something.

01:44.500 --> 01:48.135
I put down mine. You
want to put down yours?

01:48.170 --> 01:49.837
No way, man!

01:49.889 --> 01:52.640
That's... that's fine. That's okay.

01:52.675 --> 01:55.893
I'm just gonna come a little
bit closer so we can talk.

01:55.978 --> 01:59.179
I think you and me might have
got off on the wrong foot.

01:59.265 --> 02:02.566
How 'bout we start over, huh?

02:02.652 --> 02:05.319
You went to North Evanston High, right?

02:05.354 --> 02:06.687
Yeah.

02:06.772 --> 02:09.607
I've got a couple buddies from there.

02:09.692 --> 02:11.609
Go, Wolverines!

02:11.694 --> 02:12.993
Yeah, go, Wolverines.

02:13.029 --> 02:15.613
Good! Now we're talking. This is good.

02:15.698 --> 02:17.248
You like sports, Josh?

02:17.333 --> 02:18.198
What?

02:18.284 --> 02:20.200
I like sports.

02:20.286 --> 02:23.003
Football, basketball.

02:23.039 --> 02:26.674
I played some back in college.
I even thought about going pro.

02:26.709 --> 02:28.626
But my problem was, I was just never...

02:28.711 --> 02:29.677
fast enough!

02:29.712 --> 02:30.928
No!

02:36.519 --> 02:39.687
No!

02:42.358 --> 02:44.525
Yeah.

02:44.560 --> 02:48.395
I guess I probably shouldn't
have sent that text, huh?

Rosa the Riveter!

03:22.682 --> 03:24.264
Top of the morning to you!

03:24.317 --> 03:26.433
Did you happen to receive the group text

03:26.519 --> 03:28.152
I sent over the weekend or...

03:28.237 --> 03:29.937
Oh. Um.

03:30.022 --> 03:32.906
So "You up? Wanna
hang?" was a group text?

03:32.942 --> 03:34.575
Yeah, yeah, no, I was merely asking

03:34.610 --> 03:37.277
the group I was texting if they were up

03:37.363 --> 03:39.246
for attending a hockey
game this weekend.

03:39.281 --> 03:41.615
Oh, see, I thought I
was the only recipient...

03:41.667 --> 03:42.783
Who else is in the group?

03:42.868 --> 03:45.419
Uh, Mike, my friend Mike.

03:45.454 --> 03:46.370
Oh! Your friend Mike.

03:46.455 --> 03:48.038
You know Mike?

03:48.124 --> 03:49.923
Well, yeah, I met him at
the food truck, remember?

03:49.959 --> 03:51.125
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:51.210 --> 03:52.676
So Mike's going to the hockey game?

03:52.762 --> 03:53.761
Y-Yeah.

03:53.796 --> 03:55.629
Okay, I mean, I enjoy hockey.

03:55.715 --> 03:56.714
Oh, good.

03:56.799 --> 03:58.015
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.550
That sounds fun. Thanks
for organizing this!

03:59.635 --> 04:00.684
- Jesus, all right.
- So sweet.

04:00.770 --> 04:02.269
Cool, thanks.

04:02.304 --> 04:03.604
Dude, I'm psyched Rosa's coming.

04:03.639 --> 04:06.140
Yeah, this is, uh... this will be good.

04:06.225 --> 04:07.474
Hey, you guys!

04:07.560 --> 04:08.809
Hey!

04:08.861 --> 04:10.310
Hey, Rosa, nice to see you again.

04:10.396 --> 04:12.062
It's nice to see you
too. What's up, Josh?

04:12.148 --> 04:13.063
Hey, hey.

04:13.149 --> 04:15.032
- Uh
- Oh! Check it out!

04:15.117 --> 04:16.399
No way!

04:16.485 --> 04:18.235
Yeah, what are the odds, right?

04:18.320 --> 04:20.120
I mean, everyone walking in
is wearing that jersey, so...

04:20.156 --> 04:21.872
Josh, take our picture!

04:21.957 --> 04:23.574
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got
to get this on the 'Gram.

04:23.659 --> 04:26.827
- Twins!
- Yes, hashtag, and...

04:26.912 --> 04:28.545
Yay. Awesome!

04:28.631 --> 04:29.880
Here you go.

04:29.965 --> 04:32.132
- Damn, we look hot. Mm.
- Oh, my God.

04:32.168 --> 04:33.801
Sexy. Oh, yeah, send that one to me.

04:33.836 --> 04:35.302
Okay. Oh, yeah, what's your number?

04:35.337 --> 04:37.554
Oh, it's, um, 847...

04:37.640 --> 04:38.889
- 555...
- Mmhmm?

04:38.974 --> 04:39.923
0169.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.560
They said you could pick
whatever number you want

04:43.646 --> 04:44.595
at the store.

04:44.680 --> 04:45.979
I love that!

04:46.015 --> 04:47.264
What have you been up to, dude?

04:47.349 --> 04:49.016
Oh, this and that, staying busy.

04:49.068 --> 04:50.434
- Oh, he's got them.
- Yeah, I got them.

04:50.519 --> 04:52.986
- He's got the tickets.
- All right!

05:03.449 --> 05:05.249
Rosa, hey!

05:05.334 --> 05:07.451
I call middle seat!

05:07.536 --> 05:09.203
Rosa! Rosa!

05:09.288 --> 05:10.621
I call middle seat!

05:10.706 --> 05:12.873
- Oh, pardon me, sir.
- Jesus.

05:12.958 --> 05:14.041
- Yeah!
- Sorry. Okay.

05:14.126 --> 05:16.260
I'm trying to... All right.

05:16.345 --> 05:19.296
Yeah, I know, just...

05:19.381 --> 05:21.298
Sorry. I know. I'm sorry.

05:21.383 --> 05:23.300
This might sound stupid, but
every time I watch hockey,

05:23.385 --> 05:24.601
I think of Casey Jones.

05:24.687 --> 05:26.186
- From the Ninja Turtles?
- Yeah!

05:26.222 --> 05:28.055
Me too, dude!

05:28.107 --> 05:29.807
I totally had a nine-year-old
boner for April O'Neil.

05:29.892 --> 05:31.975
I had an eight-year-old
boner for Raphael,

05:32.061 --> 05:33.193
because he's cool but rude!

05:34.447 --> 05:36.280
Pizza!

05:36.365 --> 05:37.815
What?

05:37.900 --> 05:41.235
Pi... the Ninja Turtles
love pizza, remember?

05:41.320 --> 05:42.653
They ate pizza.

05:42.738 --> 05:44.121
Oh, yeah, right, right, totally.

05:44.206 --> 05:47.958
- They ate pizza.
- Totally. Totally.

05:48.043 --> 05:51.328
Now it's time for the Kiss Cam!

05:51.413 --> 05:54.548
Whoo!

05:54.583 --> 05:56.967
Oh, my gosh! Oh!

05:57.052 --> 05:58.168
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

05:58.254 --> 06:00.587
Oh, my gosh!

06:00.673 --> 06:01.922
- I guess we have to.
- Yeah.

06:02.007 --> 06:03.140
You don't have to. You don't have to.

06:03.225 --> 06:06.059
Mwah.

06:07.646 --> 06:09.847
Crazy.

06:09.932 --> 06:11.682
Hey! You guys remember Thundercats?

06:11.767 --> 06:13.817
That was another cartoon that existed.

06:13.903 --> 06:16.069
Now it's time for the Kiss Cam!

06:16.105 --> 06:17.938
- Uh-uh.
- What? Again?

06:17.990 --> 06:20.157
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

06:20.242 --> 06:21.859
Oh, my gosh!

06:21.944 --> 06:23.827
Oh, for [bleep] sake, what?

06:23.913 --> 06:25.329
I guess we have to.

06:25.414 --> 06:27.498
No.

06:32.454 --> 06:33.620
Wow. Ooh, nice lips too.

06:33.672 --> 06:36.340
- Thanks!
- Hey, will you move?

06:36.425 --> 06:38.709
- I'm sorry?
- Can I... can I sit here?

06:38.794 --> 06:41.712
I'm having... uh... I
need... can't see the, uh...

06:41.797 --> 06:43.430
Can I... can I switch seat... Yeah?

06:43.465 --> 06:45.132
- Oh, all right.
- Thank you. Thank you.

06:45.217 --> 06:46.800
- Sorry.
- No, you're welcome.

06:46.852 --> 06:48.802
- Hey.
- All right.

06:48.888 --> 06:49.970
Okay!

06:50.022 --> 06:51.722
- Good game.
- Yeah.

06:51.807 --> 06:54.191
Once again, it's time for the Kiss Cam!

06:54.276 --> 06:56.310
Again?

06:56.362 --> 07:00.614
It's like... it's like, my
God, man, like, mix it up.

07:00.649 --> 07:03.116
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

07:03.152 --> 07:04.151
I'm sick of this bit.

07:04.236 --> 07:05.485
How did they do that?

07:05.571 --> 07:07.120
It's a conspiracy!

07:07.156 --> 07:08.872
- Well, I guess we have to!
- You don't!

07:08.958 --> 07:11.325
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

07:15.664 --> 07:18.048
Mm. Mm.

07:18.133 --> 07:21.919
Whoo!

07:22.004 --> 07:23.086
Whoo.

07:24.506 --> 07:25.722
I think... I don't feel so good.

07:25.808 --> 07:27.057
I think I'm gonna split.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.342
- Oh, no.
- What, really?

07:28.427 --> 07:30.561
Yeah, I got to... got to... uh, yep.

07:30.646 --> 07:32.145
I think you guys should just stay put.

07:32.181 --> 07:33.597
- What are you talking about?
- Stay put.

07:33.682 --> 07:35.933
No, I'm not, uh... Yeah,
you guys do your thing.

07:36.018 --> 07:37.684
- All right.
- No, no, it's fine. It's fine.

07:37.770 --> 07:40.354
- What are you doing?
- I guess I'll sit here again.

07:40.439 --> 07:43.907
Now it's time for the Lonely Cam!

07:46.278 --> 07:48.862
Are you f... Really, man? What is that?

07:48.948 --> 07:50.581
I think you're supposed
to masturbate and cry.

07:50.666 --> 07:52.199
I'm supposed to what?

07:52.284 --> 07:54.201
Masturbate and cry! Masturbate and cry!

07:54.253 --> 07:56.870
Guess you have to.

08:01.270 --> 08:03.016
It's, like, yet another mission

08:03.380 --> 08:05.332
where I have to take
some guy's barrel for him

08:05.452 --> 08:07.374
from one part of the city
to another part of the city.

08:07.494 --> 08:07.982
Mm-hmm.

08:08.067 --> 08:09.617
It's just like, I
bought that game because

08:09.652 --> 08:11.202
I want to be an assassin,
not a barrel courier.

08:11.287 --> 08:12.903
You know what I mean?

08:13.915 --> 08:16.081
What's up? Yeah, totally.

08:16.167 --> 08:20.136
No, I... I'm sorry.

08:20.221 --> 08:22.888
I've been meaning to talk
to you about something.

08:22.924 --> 08:26.091
Oh, yeah, what, uh, what... what's up?

08:26.144 --> 08:27.927
It's, uh... it's about Rosa.

08:28.012 --> 08:30.813
Ah, Rosa, yes.

08:30.898 --> 08:32.898
What... what about Rosa?

08:32.933 --> 08:34.316
We've been kind of hanging out.

08:34.402 --> 08:36.602
- Mm-kay.
- And nothing has happened yet.

08:36.687 --> 08:39.572
- Uh-huh.
- Whatsoever, um.

08:39.607 --> 08:41.657
But I think there's something
really special between us.

08:41.741 --> 08:45.027
What? Amazing!

08:45.112 --> 08:47.780
That's so neat. Are you sure, though?

08:47.832 --> 08:49.198
Just 'cause Rosa's very particular...

08:49.283 --> 08:51.450
- I'm sure.
- Yeah, wicked.

08:51.536 --> 08:54.370
I know you used to have
a thing for her, and, um,

08:54.455 --> 08:57.173
before we get any further,
just wanted to check

08:57.258 --> 08:59.208
to make sure that you're cool with it.

08:59.293 --> 09:01.760
Aw, Mike, Michael!

09:01.796 --> 09:04.630
I... I appreciate that, but yeah.

09:04.715 --> 09:05.798
I'm cool with it.

09:05.883 --> 09:06.882
Really?

09:06.968 --> 09:08.517
Absolutely!

09:08.603 --> 09:11.770
Okay, Josh, but honestly,
if you are not cool with it,

09:11.806 --> 09:14.023
just say so, and I'll nip
the whole thing in the bud.

09:14.108 --> 09:16.475
Mi-i-i-i-i-ke!

09:16.527 --> 09:18.777
I'm cool with it, man. I really am.

09:18.813 --> 09:20.529
I'm cool with it.

09:27.288 --> 09:30.239
So you guys like each
other and you want to date

09:30.324 --> 09:31.991
Well, I'm not upset

09:32.043 --> 09:33.492
In fact, I think that's great

09:33.544 --> 09:35.578
'Cause I'm cool with it

09:35.663 --> 09:36.996
He's cool with it

09:37.048 --> 09:38.664
Totally cool with it

09:38.716 --> 09:40.833
Yeah, he's cool with it

09:40.885 --> 09:42.334
Now I bet you think I'm jealous

09:42.386 --> 09:43.886
Well, that's something I'm above

09:43.971 --> 09:45.554
I'm psyched that my best friend

09:45.640 --> 09:47.423
Is with the girl that I...

09:47.508 --> 09:51.510
Know from work and consider a friend.

09:51.562 --> 09:53.145
He's cool with it

09:53.180 --> 09:55.180
I'm... I'm really happy for you guys.

09:55.233 --> 09:57.683
Totally cool with it

09:57.735 --> 09:59.568
I'm cool with it

10:02.189 --> 10:03.439
You believe me now?

10:03.524 --> 10:05.157
Totally! Thanks, man!

10:05.192 --> 10:06.358
Got to get the oysters.

10:06.444 --> 10:07.359
I read online that they are

10:07.445 --> 10:08.861
the best in the city.

10:08.946 --> 10:10.079
- Okay, oysters it is.
- Yeah, kind of a big...

10:11.365 --> 10:12.865
All right.

10:12.950 --> 10:13.866
Oh, my God.

10:16.337 --> 10:17.536
Ah!

10:20.174 --> 10:23.092
I see you two are out
for a romantic night

10:23.177 --> 10:24.510
While I'll be going home now

10:24.545 --> 10:26.211
To watch some "Seinfelds" alone

10:26.264 --> 10:27.763
But I'm cool with it

10:27.848 --> 10:29.548
He's cool with it

10:29.634 --> 10:31.133
Have a wonderful time

10:31.218 --> 10:33.135
Make it the night of your lives

10:33.220 --> 10:34.720
It's cool

10:34.805 --> 10:35.721
Thanks, man.

10:35.806 --> 10:37.556
Thanks, Josh.

10:37.608 --> 10:40.476
Good stuff, girls. Okay,
let's get out of here.

10:40.561 --> 10:42.394
No, I never really knew
my biological father.

10:42.446 --> 10:44.647
- Was that hard for you?
- Of course!

10:44.732 --> 10:48.734
I can't imagine. I mean, my dad was...

10:48.786 --> 10:51.654
I'm so cool with it,
it's like I'm made of ice

10:51.739 --> 10:55.157
Have you guys had sex yet? I don't care

10:55.242 --> 10:56.825
He's cool with it

10:56.911 --> 10:58.627
But have you, though?

10:58.713 --> 11:00.245
Not that it matters

11:00.298 --> 11:01.747
-  He's cool
- Have you, though?

11:01.799 --> 11:02.915
We're in the middle of something.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.166
Yeah.

11:04.251 --> 11:05.217
Oh, yeah, understood. Sorry.

11:05.252 --> 11:06.752
- Thanks.
- Yep, sorry.

11:06.804 --> 11:08.837
All right, listen, okay,
that was a disaster.

11:08.923 --> 11:09.838
I want nice, tight snaps.

11:09.924 --> 11:10.923
My mom is awesome.

11:11.008 --> 11:12.474
Snaps you can eat off of.

11:21.435 --> 11:23.602
Ah!

11:23.688 --> 11:26.438
Here's a little bit of a hypothetical

11:26.524 --> 11:29.491
What if I were to say that
I'm no longer cool with it?

11:29.577 --> 11:31.076
Just throwing it out there

11:31.112 --> 11:34.330
Not that that's actually
how I feel, but if...

11:34.415 --> 11:36.332
Would you stop dating?

11:36.417 --> 11:37.583
No.

11:37.618 --> 11:40.619
I mean, we're kind of a thing now.

11:40.671 --> 11:42.287
Yeah! Yeah, no, that's... that's...

11:42.340 --> 11:44.707
Yeah, that's what I thought, okay.

11:44.792 --> 11:47.259
- Cool.
- Cool.

11:47.294 --> 11:49.545
- Well, good night!
- Good night, man.

11:49.630 --> 11:51.630
All right, come on, this way.

11:51.682 --> 11:53.716
Mr. Cranky Pants is not a showbiz fan.

11:53.801 --> 11:56.051
- It's 3:00 in the morning!
- Okay, come on.

11:59.190 --> 12:00.639
Jesus.

12:00.691 --> 12:03.058
Knock, knock. Sorry, uh...

12:03.144 --> 12:06.145
The door... the door, um, is
it locked from the outside?

12:06.230 --> 12:07.363
Does someone lock you in every night?

12:07.448 --> 12:09.281
No!

12:09.316 --> 12:10.482
'Cause we're having a
hell of a time opening...

12:10.568 --> 12:12.034
Just push it! Push it. It's a door.

12:12.119 --> 12:13.786
- Is it a push-and-lift?
- I'm so tired, man!

12:13.821 --> 12:15.154
- Push-and-lift?
- I don't know!

12:15.206 --> 12:16.238
- Okay, fine.
- It's a door.

12:16.323 --> 12:17.656
I'm tired, please.

12:17.708 --> 12:19.708
You know, you [bleep] live here, so...

12:19.794 --> 12:21.326
You've been in here a million times.

12:21.412 --> 12:24.880
I live here. Jesus Christ, man.

12:24.965 --> 12:26.215
So is it... is it a push-and-lift?

12:26.300 --> 12:27.166
Come on!

12:31.035 --> 12:33.235
Did, um... did Mike send
you that Evite that he made

12:33.287 --> 12:35.538
for Rosa's birthday party with the...

12:35.573 --> 12:36.989
with the Ninja Turtles?

12:37.075 --> 12:38.491
It was so cute.

12:38.576 --> 12:41.243
Yeah, yeah, he sent it
to me. I received it.

12:41.329 --> 12:42.795
You gonna go?

12:42.880 --> 12:47.049
Ah, meh, I don't know.

12:47.085 --> 12:48.584
Really?

12:48.669 --> 12:49.885
What do you want? They're a couple.

12:49.921 --> 12:51.670
They're, like, actually a couple now.

12:51.756 --> 12:53.556
And, uh,

12:53.591 --> 12:58.144
I know I'm supposed to
be cool with it, but, uh,

12:58.229 --> 13:00.262
yeah, it's hard... it's hard
for me to be around them.

13:00.314 --> 13:02.515
Yeah, no, totally. I get that.

13:04.652 --> 13:06.769
- Can I give you some advice?
- Oh, shit.

13:06.821 --> 13:08.738
Yeah, do it.

13:08.773 --> 13:10.523
The only way you're gonna get over Rosa

13:10.608 --> 13:12.491
is to try to find someone new.

13:12.577 --> 13:16.245
Yeah, maybe you're right.

13:17.698 --> 13:20.332
It was so, so, so fun.

13:20.418 --> 13:23.002
And then, on the drive
home, we found a dude

13:23.087 --> 13:24.620
selling fireworks on
the side of the road.

13:24.705 --> 13:26.088
I bought the biggest one.

13:26.124 --> 13:27.790
It's called the Teddy Blows-evelt.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.593
Gonna set it off at midnight
to celebrate this little cutie.

13:30.628 --> 13:32.711
Wow, Mike, this is a really...

13:32.797 --> 13:34.513
this is a really awesome party.

13:34.599 --> 13:36.549
- This is a really awesome lady.
- Babe!

13:36.634 --> 13:38.267
Hey, baby.

13:38.302 --> 13:41.187
What's up, party people?

13:41.272 --> 13:42.772
Oh, good, you made it.

13:42.807 --> 13:45.691
Actually, we made it.

13:47.445 --> 13:53.115
Liz, meet my new girlfriend, Bosa.

13:53.151 --> 13:55.785
Bosa? Nice to meet you.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.908
Isn't she great?

14:02.994 --> 14:04.910
Yeah.

14:04.996 --> 14:06.495
- Let's go get a drink.
- Yeah, you got it.

14:06.547 --> 14:07.546
- Yeah.
- Stay put.

14:07.632 --> 14:09.465
Don't eat any garbage.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.801
- Okay, Josh...
- Yes?

14:11.836 --> 14:13.219
Doesn't Bosa remind you of someone?

14:13.304 --> 14:17.590
Huh. Uh, Dame Angelina Jolie?

14:17.675 --> 14:20.176
- She looks a lot like Rosa.
- She looks nothing like Rosa.

14:20.261 --> 14:22.228
- Josh!
- Dr. Orloff?

14:22.313 --> 14:24.263
Your Rosa clone is malfunctioning.

14:24.348 --> 14:26.182
I tried to create what you asked.

14:26.234 --> 14:29.568
But she's a monster.

14:29.654 --> 14:32.438
I'm so sorry.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.523
- Josh!
- Yeah?

14:34.575 --> 14:36.358
- Really?
- What?

14:36.444 --> 14:37.827
Okay, I know you're stuck on Rosa,

14:37.862 --> 14:39.862
but cloning her is not the solution.

14:39.914 --> 14:42.198
I am not stuck on Rosa.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.950
brown hair, brown eyes,

14:45.036 --> 14:50.372
genetic sequence AAAAAGCTGCCCTAAAA.

14:50.424 --> 14:53.092
Look, the point is, we're really happy.

14:55.179 --> 14:57.046
Kill...

14:57.131 --> 14:58.931
me.

14:59.016 --> 15:00.683
Shit.

15:00.718 --> 15:04.186
No, no, no, no. No, no,
oop, oh, okay, no, no.

15:04.222 --> 15:06.772
No, no, no.

15:06.858 --> 15:07.940
Yield!

15:08.025 --> 15:09.058
Yield!

15:09.143 --> 15:10.643
Can I get a whiskey, please?

15:13.895 --> 15:17.227
Hold up! Yo! Listen up, everybody.

15:17.313 --> 15:19.146
I just want to say something real quick.

15:19.231 --> 15:21.365
And I am not just saying this
because it's her birthday.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.201
But, Rosa, you are the kindest,

15:24.236 --> 15:27.955
smartest, funniest, sexiest babe

15:28.040 --> 15:28.989
I have ever met.

15:29.075 --> 15:30.624
Aww!

15:30.709 --> 15:33.077
So here's to my little Choo-Choo

15:33.162 --> 15:35.662
from your big ol' loose caboose.

15:35.748 --> 15:37.081
Happy birthday, Rosa.

15:37.133 --> 15:38.882
Happy birthday, Rosa!

15:38.918 --> 15:40.751
Happy birthday.

15:42.922 --> 15:44.721
Whoa, Josh, Josh!

15:44.757 --> 15:46.557
Wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa.

15:49.178 --> 15:50.811
Everybody!

15:50.896 --> 15:52.930
Today is also my girlfriend's birthday!

15:53.015 --> 15:54.348
Bosa!

15:54.433 --> 15:57.234
She was born this
morning in a centrifuge!

15:57.269 --> 16:00.104
And she loves me, and I love her,

16:00.189 --> 16:01.488
and everybody loves her.

16:01.574 --> 16:04.575
So from... to my... to my, uh,

16:04.610 --> 16:07.911
hoppy, floppy bunny rabbit

16:07.947 --> 16:12.616
from... from your
chunky little carrot man,

16:12.701 --> 16:15.452
happy birthday, Bosa!

16:15.504 --> 16:18.205
Happy birthday, Bosa.

16:18.290 --> 16:22.092
Kill me.

16:22.128 --> 16:24.511
There's a lot to love about Bosa,

16:24.597 --> 16:28.048
and I don't just mean her
pretty face or her giant hand.

16:28.134 --> 16:29.633
And... and... and I'll tell you

16:29.685 --> 16:31.301
the thing I like about her the most:

16:31.387 --> 16:33.187
she's definitely not the kind of person

16:33.272 --> 16:35.856
that would go out with your best friend

16:35.941 --> 16:37.975
after giving you every indication

16:38.060 --> 16:39.359
that she wanted to kiss you.

16:39.445 --> 16:40.978
All right. Good speech, bro.

16:41.030 --> 16:43.530
Thanks, bro! Radical!

16:43.616 --> 16:45.232
Catch a wave, dude!

16:45.317 --> 16:47.401
Hey, Josh! It's not cool, man.

16:47.486 --> 16:49.786
Oh, really, was it not? Was it not cool?

16:49.822 --> 16:51.655
Was it not cool? Well,
I'll tell you something.

16:51.740 --> 16:53.373
What you guys are
doing isn't cool either.

16:53.459 --> 16:55.576
We asked, and you said
you were cool with it.

16:55.661 --> 16:58.829
What was I supposed to say?

16:58.914 --> 16:59.963
I'm leaving.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.465
Bosa!

17:01.500 --> 17:03.083
Oh my God! She's got a firework!

17:03.169 --> 17:05.669
She's got a what?

17:05.753 --> 17:08.271
The Teddy Blows-Evelt. Get down!

17:12.011 --> 17:15.179
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

17:15.263 --> 17:16.930
Good night, sweet clone.

17:17.016 --> 17:19.983
- I'm so sorry, Josh.
- Ah, it's okay.

17:20.019 --> 17:22.019
She really hated being alive.

17:22.104 --> 17:24.021
Yeah.

17:24.073 --> 17:25.155
So long, Bosa X.

17:27.992 --> 17:29.359
Bosa X?

17:29.445 --> 17:31.578
Oh, yeah, she's the one you met.

17:31.664 --> 17:35.199
The, uh... the rest of them
didn't really work out so good.

17:35.251 --> 17:36.867
Yikes.

17:36.952 --> 17:39.620
So, uh, what's gonna happen
with you and Mike and Rosa?

17:39.705 --> 17:42.589
I don't know; they're
still pretty angry at me,

17:42.675 --> 17:44.424
which I understand.

17:44.510 --> 17:47.544
My behavior was less than perfect.

17:47.630 --> 17:50.264
Yeah, they'll get over it.

17:50.349 --> 17:52.933
And guess what. So will you.

17:53.018 --> 17:53.967
What about me?

17:54.053 --> 17:56.136
Ah! Dr. Orloff.

17:58.774 --> 18:02.192
I will never get over my
crimes against God and nature.

18:02.228 --> 18:04.811
I put shame upon myself
and all of science.

18:04.897 --> 18:06.363
Why did you do it if
you hate it so much?

18:06.398 --> 18:09.066
For money. Word of advice.

18:09.118 --> 18:11.401
Do not send your kids
to private schools.

18:11.453 --> 18:13.904
Yeah. Yeah.

18:13.989 --> 18:16.823
Listen, guys, let's...
let's go get a beer.

18:16.909 --> 18:18.659
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah. I'll pay.

18:18.744 --> 18:19.993
I'm not having beer right now.

18:20.079 --> 18:21.962
I'm on this low-carb thing.

18:22.047 --> 18:23.830
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

18:23.916 --> 18:26.633
Well, I'm sure they can,
yeah, find something for you.

18:26.719 --> 18:28.252
Yeah, we'll... yeah.

18:28.337 --> 18:30.837
Thanks, guys. You really
are my best friends.

18:58.250 --> 19:00.334
I... I can't afford this!

19:00.419 --> 19:01.835
I thought you guys were non-union.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.120
We're in Actors' Equity.

19:03.205 --> 19:04.231
You're all Equity?

19:04.351 --> 19:06.976
If one of us is Equity, then
it's an Equity production,

19:07.096 --> 19:09.194
and we're all owed Equity compensation.

19:09.958 --> 19:11.012
Even the drummer?

19:11.541 --> 19:14.268
All he did was play one
beat over and over again.

19:14.388 --> 19:16.631
I don't make the rules, daddy-o.
