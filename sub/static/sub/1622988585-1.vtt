01:09.659 --> 01:13.496
Oh.
Hey! I didn't see you there.

01:13.530 --> 01:15.700
Come, take a seat.

01:15.733 --> 01:17.535
How you doing?

01:17.567 --> 01:18.935
I have a story to tell you.

01:22.406 --> 01:25.676
My name is Tyler Sternberg
and I'm a filmmaker.

01:25.709 --> 01:28.746
Not just any filmmaker...
a filmmaker with style,

01:28.778 --> 01:30.013
with flair,

01:30.046 --> 01:32.649
and a little bit of moxie.

01:32.683 --> 01:33.918
Ever since I was young,

01:33.950 --> 01:36.419
I've had the moviemaking bug.

01:36.453 --> 01:38.555
I wanted to make something
that was full of wonder

01:38.588 --> 01:39.890
and amazement,

01:39.923 --> 01:42.492
so I went to film school
and put my craft to work,

01:42.525 --> 01:44.262
learning every technique
I could,

01:44.295 --> 01:46.597
just waiting for my chance
to make a legitimate movie.

01:49.966 --> 01:51.668
And a few weeks
after graduating,

01:51.701 --> 01:53.536
that moment finally happened.

01:53.569 --> 01:56.673
Ow! Come on,
are you serious?

01:56.706 --> 01:58.041
I said I was filming.

01:58.075 --> 02:00.911
That's when I got
my opportunity with this man.

02:00.944 --> 02:02.947
An esteemed author
who has published

02:02.980 --> 02:05.783
numerous books
on cults around the world.

02:05.816 --> 02:07.685
Sure, they're sensationalized,

02:07.718 --> 02:08.686
but a job's a job,

02:08.717 --> 02:11.721
and I plan to make
the most badass film I can

02:11.754 --> 02:13.890
about a subject
I know nothing about.

02:24.401 --> 02:25.402
You want me
to take my shirt...

02:25.436 --> 02:27.671
You don't need to take off
your whole shirt.

02:27.705 --> 02:30.841
Might as well just do it.

02:30.873 --> 02:32.942
You're just gonna
put it back on.

02:32.975 --> 02:35.846
Okay, dude.

02:35.878 --> 02:37.647
That... don't...

02:38.816 --> 02:40.418
here, okay?

02:40.450 --> 02:41.485
Do you want me to do this?

02:41.519 --> 02:43.320
What do you want me...
what do you want me to do?

02:43.354 --> 02:45.089
- You're the expert here.
- Uh, yeah, I...

02:45.122 --> 02:47.992
So say your name and,
you know, why you're here.

02:48.025 --> 02:50.661
Let's get this started.

02:50.693 --> 02:52.962
Let's pretend
the camera's not there.

02:52.996 --> 02:54.965
Why?

02:54.997 --> 02:57.467
Just trust me.
It'll look better.

02:57.501 --> 03:00.037
Are you ready to start?

03:00.069 --> 03:02.972
I was born fucking ready.

03:03.006 --> 03:05.675
Cool. Uh, could you clap
for sound, please?

03:06.909 --> 03:08.746
Great.

03:08.778 --> 03:11.115
All right, let's just start
with saying your name.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.016
My name's Robert Regis.

03:13.050 --> 03:15.686
- Don't say in the camera...
- My name's Robert Regis.

03:15.718 --> 03:17.020
Great. One more time.

03:17.054 --> 03:21.491
My name
is Robert Regis.

03:21.525 --> 03:23.027
Awesome.

03:23.060 --> 03:26.597
So, tell us a little bit
about this particular doc.

03:29.967 --> 03:31.969
The cult that we're looking for?

03:32.002 --> 03:33.871
Yeah.

03:36.073 --> 03:39.610
Uh, how could I
describe it to you?

03:39.643 --> 03:44.548
The cult we're looking for is

03:44.580 --> 03:46.950
the Bigfoot of cults.

03:46.984 --> 03:49.719
The Loch Ness monster of cults.

03:49.752 --> 03:51.755
The chupacabra of cults.

03:51.788 --> 03:55.725
The most elusive, okay?

03:55.758 --> 03:59.028
Does the word "Abaddon"
ring a bell?

03:59.062 --> 04:00.164
No.

04:00.197 --> 04:02.733
Legendary demon
from the Old Testament.

04:02.765 --> 04:04.467
One of the few demons
that made it

04:04.501 --> 04:06.069
into the New Testament.

04:06.103 --> 04:09.073
That name literally means
"doom."

04:09.105 --> 04:10.274
In the New Testament,

04:10.306 --> 04:13.143
he's said to be an angel
that led an army of locusts,

04:13.176 --> 04:16.546
a destroyer.

04:16.579 --> 04:17.846
Well, he got himself
a following

04:17.880 --> 04:20.183
a few thousand years back.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.786
They're called
the Disciples of Abaddon.

04:22.819 --> 04:26.557
Never been found,
never been seen.

04:26.589 --> 04:29.726
Sail under the radar.

04:29.759 --> 04:33.730
That's what makes them
impossible to track.

04:33.764 --> 04:35.499
They're just like you and me,

04:35.531 --> 04:38.701
only every 50,
maybe 100 years,

04:38.735 --> 04:40.670
they gather for three rituals

04:40.704 --> 04:43.040
and sacrifice
in the demon's name,

04:43.072 --> 04:48.178
and thus get the power
of immortality.

04:48.211 --> 04:50.514
I believe that they also
recruit a new member

04:50.547 --> 04:52.917
during this period
of rituals too.

04:52.949 --> 04:55.151
All this transpires
while maintaining secrecy,

04:55.185 --> 04:59.088
which it's literally
in their rules.

04:59.122 --> 05:01.625
They can't ever get married.

05:01.658 --> 05:06.062
They can never have any type
of luxurious lifestyles.

05:06.096 --> 05:09.132
They live like peasants, okay?

05:09.165 --> 05:11.601
All in attempt
to fly under the radar,

05:11.634 --> 05:14.471
and it's worked for 'em
for thousands of years.

05:14.504 --> 05:16.173
But guess what?

05:16.206 --> 05:19.009
They didn't take one thing
into account.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.210
Know what that is?

05:20.244 --> 05:22.980
- What?
- Rob-fucking-Regis.

05:23.012 --> 05:24.614
Again, pretend
the camera's not there,

05:24.648 --> 05:26.183
- that was cool.
- No, this is important

05:26.216 --> 05:28.052
- That was pretty cool, right?
- Yeah, that was cool.

05:28.084 --> 05:29.887
That was pretty cool, okay.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.189
Rob-fucking-Regis
is on their tail now.

05:32.221 --> 05:33.858
Okay? And you can't ever
hide from me.

05:33.891 --> 05:35.059
I will sniff you out,

05:35.091 --> 05:36.560
I will find you,
and when I do,

05:36.593 --> 05:38.729
I'm going
to fucking nail your ass

05:38.762 --> 05:41.899
straight onto the wall
for the world to see.

05:44.166 --> 05:46.669
Rob-fucking-Regis.

05:46.702 --> 05:48.572
Okay.

05:48.605 --> 05:52.076
Is there any evidence of this?

05:53.976 --> 05:57.514
I have two pieces of evidence,

05:57.548 --> 05:59.850
and I worked long and hard
to find 'em.

05:59.882 --> 06:00.817
Through all of my toils,

06:00.850 --> 06:05.221
I was able to ascertain
two pieces of evidence

06:05.254 --> 06:08.158
in my long, storied career.

06:08.190 --> 06:11.628
Evidence number one:

06:11.661 --> 06:14.597
this piece of paper.

06:14.630 --> 06:16.165
That's a buncha numbers on it.

06:16.199 --> 06:19.836
I'm very proud of this one.

06:19.870 --> 06:21.271
And piece number two?

06:21.305 --> 06:24.975
I have a drawing
of this man.

06:25.007 --> 06:27.277
He allegedly knows more.

06:27.310 --> 06:29.212
That looks like
a children's drawing.

06:29.245 --> 06:32.682
This is a children's drawing.

06:32.716 --> 06:33.918
Thanks, Timmy.

06:36.752 --> 06:38.822
Now, I got lucky with this guy
and he reached out.

06:38.855 --> 06:42.259
There's also a chance
this is a huge waste of time.

06:46.062 --> 06:48.565
Fuckin' heap of shit.

06:48.598 --> 06:50.067
- I'm looking good?
- Lookin' great.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.835
- Rule number three.
- Rule number three.

06:51.867 --> 06:53.202
Rule number three:
Do I look good?

06:53.235 --> 06:55.004
Oh yeah... Rob Rules.

06:56.273 --> 06:57.908
Can't forget about those.

06:57.940 --> 07:00.610
Let's quickly circle back
and hear these important rules.

07:00.644 --> 07:05.749
Very, very intricate,
detailed rules.

07:05.781 --> 07:07.050
Lots of them.

07:08.351 --> 07:12.889
Rule number one:
Always be filming.

07:12.923 --> 07:18.362
Okay? Rule number two:
Always be filming.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.363
And rule number three:

07:20.396 --> 07:25.301
Always make me look good
while you're filming.

07:25.334 --> 07:28.237
Anyways, where were we?

07:28.271 --> 07:30.107
Rob, where are we?

07:30.139 --> 07:33.743
We are at a gentleman's house
that contacted me in Com...

07:33.776 --> 07:35.245
Actually, he doesn't know
that I'm bringing a camera crew,

07:35.278 --> 07:39.116
so just kinda
chill in the back, okay?

07:39.149 --> 07:41.117
What's this guy's name again?

07:41.151 --> 07:43.821
- Old guy?
- Old g...

07:43.853 --> 07:45.254
you don't remember his name?

07:45.288 --> 07:47.358
I don't know;
with your great drawing,

07:47.391 --> 07:50.694
you didn't give me
much specifics.

07:50.726 --> 07:51.794
Hello!

07:55.098 --> 07:57.401
- Welcome.
- How you doing, sir?

07:57.434 --> 07:58.836
Good. Who the hell are you?

07:58.869 --> 08:00.137
Rob Regis.

08:00.170 --> 08:02.306
Hey, man, how's it going?

08:02.338 --> 08:04.742
Hippie Joe.

08:09.346 --> 08:11.048
Nice to meet you.

08:11.081 --> 08:12.716
Nice to meet you too,
Hippie Joe.

08:12.749 --> 08:14.685
- Ready for the tour?
- I'm ready for the tour.

08:14.718 --> 08:16.387
- Right, let's go do it, dude.
- Let's go do it.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.122
I'll be right behind you,
Hippie Joe.

08:18.154 --> 08:19.422
All right.

08:19.456 --> 08:22.727
Druggie.

08:26.362 --> 08:28.365
Come on through, bud.

08:28.398 --> 08:29.867
All right.

08:29.899 --> 08:30.933
Oh, you got the fireplace going,

08:30.966 --> 08:32.168
- that's nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:32.201 --> 08:34.672
- This is your place?
- This is mi casa.

08:34.705 --> 08:36.139
I mean, he lived in the back,

08:36.173 --> 08:37.240
but this is my spot
right here.

08:37.274 --> 08:38.442
He lived here.

08:38.475 --> 08:40.009
On the back house,
but yeah,

08:40.043 --> 08:41.177
- he lived here.
- Here?

08:41.211 --> 08:42.846
Absolutely.

08:42.879 --> 08:44.782
Wanna see my stained glass
collection?

08:44.815 --> 08:46.350
I'm... no.

08:46.383 --> 08:48.085
I would like to see
where he lived, though.

08:48.118 --> 08:50.054
- Show me where he lived, please.
- Maybe later.

08:50.086 --> 08:51.822
Yeah, come on through,
come on through.

08:51.855 --> 08:53.791
Okay, later,
I'll see it later.

08:59.462 --> 09:04.467
Watch out for the wasps, man,
we got an outbreak this year.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.937
Yeah, man,
he seemed like a righteous dude,

09:06.970 --> 09:09.306
but he was really weird, man.

09:09.339 --> 09:11.775
Like, really weird, brother.

09:11.807 --> 09:14.812
- This is where he stayed?
- Right in there.

09:24.386 --> 09:29.058
Yeah, take a look around,
man.

09:29.091 --> 09:33.864
Yeah, this is it, man,
I'm fixing it up.

09:33.897 --> 09:35.999
Needs a little bit of work.

09:36.032 --> 09:38.102
Working on it right now.

09:38.134 --> 09:40.169
When I'm done with it,
it's gonna be magic.

09:42.205 --> 09:46.043
Two words: purple glitter.

09:46.076 --> 09:48.512
Yes, he was a weird dude,
really weird.

09:48.544 --> 09:51.080
Liked to drink,
and you know, when he drank,

09:51.114 --> 09:52.516
he'd start talking,

09:52.548 --> 09:55.519
and I guess I got one
of those faces you can trust,

09:55.552 --> 09:59.389
so he told me all sorts
of crazy... crazy shit.

09:59.422 --> 10:02.759
Like, he lived a million years
and was tired of it

10:02.793 --> 10:05.495
and belonged to
some kind of a cult.

10:05.528 --> 10:07.798
- I don't know what the name was.
- Yeah.

10:07.831 --> 10:10.300
Probably nothing.

10:10.332 --> 10:12.535
Yeah, so, um, yeah,
take a look around, man.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.937
this is it.

10:14.971 --> 10:17.206
All right, thank you,
Hippie Joe.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.475
I'm, uh, just gonna
look around a little bit, okay?

10:19.509 --> 10:23.781
- Yeah, take your time.
- All right.

10:23.813 --> 10:25.848
Okay.

10:25.881 --> 10:26.983
Now.

10:29.385 --> 10:30.520
What are we looking for,
exactly?

10:30.553 --> 10:31.889
Hippie Joe!

10:31.922 --> 10:33.923
Mind if I look
in the bathroom?

10:33.956 --> 10:34.991
- Sure.
- I'm just gonna look around

10:35.024 --> 10:36.425
a little bit, okay?

10:36.458 --> 10:37.860
Yeah.

10:37.894 --> 10:40.464
This is a staph infection
waiting to happen.

10:40.496 --> 10:42.865
Let's check it out in here.

10:42.899 --> 10:44.168
Let's go.

10:53.176 --> 10:55.012
Kid, lemme tell you.

10:55.044 --> 11:00.016
I've shit in holes in Mexico
that are nicer than this.

11:00.049 --> 11:03.252
Do you think a disciple
actually lived here?

11:03.285 --> 11:05.455
I don't know.

11:12.162 --> 11:13.997
Hey, Tyler!

11:14.029 --> 11:15.899
Come over here.

11:15.932 --> 11:17.134
Come here.

11:17.167 --> 11:18.468
No, nothing, Hippie Joe.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.069
Interesting choice of window
over there.

11:20.102 --> 11:22.072
C'mere.

11:22.105 --> 11:23.139
C'mere.

11:23.173 --> 11:25.042
That's it.
That's the symbol right there.

11:25.075 --> 11:27.477
Really?

11:27.509 --> 11:30.480
This is it right here,
it's that mark.

11:30.513 --> 11:32.115
Okay, this is what
I need you to do.

11:32.148 --> 11:33.517
Go ask Hippie Joe
a few questions

11:33.549 --> 11:37.053
while I quietly
investigate this area.

11:37.086 --> 11:38.855
What am I supposed to ask him?

11:38.889 --> 11:42.125
I don't know, ask him when
he felt it wasn't important

11:42.158 --> 11:44.927
to be a productive
member of society anymore.

11:44.961 --> 11:48.331
Hippie! My camera crew
has a few questions for you.

11:48.365 --> 11:49.932
So, Mr. Joe.

11:49.966 --> 11:52.134
This man that lived here
hadn't lived here

11:52.168 --> 11:53.604
for a long time?

11:53.636 --> 11:56.539
Uh, yeah, he lived here
about a year,

11:56.572 --> 11:58.074
right around.

11:58.107 --> 12:00.977
And his personality.
Tell me about that.

12:01.010 --> 12:02.545
Uh, he was a pretty quiet guy.

12:02.578 --> 12:05.649
You know, kept to himself,
pretty much a recluse.

12:05.682 --> 12:07.985
You know, didn't talk much.

12:08.018 --> 12:11.421
You know, just in and out,
wouldn't hear from him.

12:11.453 --> 12:15.057
So, you guys never held
much of a conversation.

12:15.091 --> 12:16.525
Yeah, you know,
he talked to me.

12:16.558 --> 12:18.928
I mean,
I got one of those faces,

12:18.961 --> 12:20.663
so we'd talk now and then.

12:20.697 --> 12:22.532
And other than
that one incident

12:22.565 --> 12:23.733
where he was intoxicated.

12:23.765 --> 12:28.204
No, no. I mean, nothing...
nothing more than your usual,

12:28.238 --> 12:30.073
you know, friendly banter.

12:30.105 --> 12:32.942
And how, Mr. Joe, exactly
did he leave this residence?

12:32.975 --> 12:36.379
He just woke up one morning and
he was gone all of a sudden...

12:36.413 --> 12:38.048
hey, man!

12:38.081 --> 12:40.149
Don't do that.

12:40.182 --> 12:43.452
You're fuckin'
ruining my floors!

12:43.485 --> 12:45.355
What are you doing, man?

12:45.388 --> 12:47.157
Uh, tell me about
your stained glass collection.

12:47.190 --> 12:49.026
- Do you make them yourself?
- What? I-I...

12:49.058 --> 12:52.062
you're breakin' my floors.

12:52.095 --> 12:53.330
Oh.

12:53.363 --> 12:55.332
What... what are you doing, man?

12:55.365 --> 12:57.134
- Sorry.
- That's not cool.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.069
I know,
it was a weird one.

12:59.101 --> 13:01.304
It's weird,
but it was an accident.

13:01.337 --> 13:03.406
An accident?

13:03.440 --> 13:05.208
- Just wasn't meant to be.
- Aww, man.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.244
- Man, what... what...
- I'm really sorry, Hippie Joe.

13:07.277 --> 13:09.246
We gotta go.
We gotta go, I'm sorry.

13:09.278 --> 13:10.514
Thank you for your time.

13:10.547 --> 13:12.283
Unbelievable, man.

13:15.351 --> 13:17.520
- Ready?
- Hold for plane...

13:17.553 --> 13:20.122
Yeah, there's a lot of planes
right here.

13:20.155 --> 13:22.992
John Wayne Airport's
right down the road.

13:23.025 --> 13:25.161
Look how fuckin' slow
they go, too.

13:25.195 --> 13:27.331
Fuckin' slow piece of shit.

13:29.532 --> 13:33.370
Yep. Wait, are we still
getting that plane?

13:33.403 --> 13:35.072
Don't worry,
the dog doesn't do anything,

13:35.105 --> 13:36.706
just wag his tail.

13:36.740 --> 13:39.308
He didn't quite pan out
how I thought he was going to.

13:39.341 --> 13:41.311
Got that "Beware of Dog" sign
for nothing.

13:41.344 --> 13:42.579
Come on!

13:42.611 --> 13:44.413
Let's go, kid, let's go.

13:46.482 --> 13:49.585
What I am about to tell you
is top secret.

13:49.619 --> 13:55.125
I've been able to ascertain
from these numbers this.

13:55.158 --> 13:59.129
What?

14:00.663 --> 14:02.566
What, a phone number?

14:02.599 --> 14:04.301
Like, a Social Security number?

14:04.333 --> 14:05.735
Goddammit, kid,
you're not helping me.

14:05.769 --> 14:07.236
What does this look like to you?

14:07.269 --> 14:11.508
Like, uh... like a code
for a bank safe.

14:11.541 --> 14:14.244
Code. It is a code.

14:14.277 --> 14:16.480
Not a bank safe, though.

14:16.513 --> 14:18.215
You don't got nothin' else?

14:18.248 --> 14:20.182
Uh...

14:20.216 --> 14:23.186
No. No.

14:23.219 --> 14:25.155
Like, dude, they're
just a bunch of numbers.

14:25.187 --> 14:26.389
I have no fucking clue.

14:26.423 --> 14:27.557
Like, what the fuck
do you think this is?

14:27.590 --> 14:29.658
Shh! Shut up!

14:29.692 --> 14:34.163
Three. Starts with a T.

14:34.197 --> 14:35.131
Tiffany.

14:35.164 --> 14:36.665
One! What's one start with?

14:36.698 --> 14:39.101
Zero. Olivia.

14:39.134 --> 14:42.639
Two. Starts with, uh, a T.

14:42.672 --> 14:43.740
Theresa.

14:43.773 --> 14:45.108
What's not right here?

14:45.140 --> 14:48.110
There is no six.

14:48.144 --> 14:50.047
Six and the nine's down here.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.482
God, I could go
for a good 69 right now.

14:52.514 --> 14:59.188
Six. Starts with an S.
Sarah. Suzie. Stacey. Samantha.

14:59.221 --> 15:02.158
Oh my god. Sabile.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.394
It's fucking coordinates.

15:04.427 --> 15:06.596
This is coordinates right here!

15:06.629 --> 15:09.132
That's exactly what it is.

15:09.164 --> 15:12.235
Are those all, like,
girls you slept with?

15:12.268 --> 15:15.338
You know the answer to that,
boy.

15:15.370 --> 15:18.674
Oral sex?

15:18.707 --> 15:22.778
Okay. Where is this going to?

15:22.812 --> 15:25.148
Mm, do we need like a map...
is this like...

15:25.181 --> 15:26.716
Yeah. That's the next thing
we have to figure out.

16:14.464 --> 16:16.500
This guy sure got
really far out here.

16:35.684 --> 16:37.353
Okay.

16:37.386 --> 16:39.455
It's this way kid,

16:39.489 --> 16:41.358
and we take this path.

16:42.792 --> 16:45.162
I'm gonna hop up this

16:45.195 --> 16:46.663
and then we're gonna
start moving.

16:46.696 --> 16:47.797
Let's go.

16:47.830 --> 16:50.800
Give the old man a push.

16:53.235 --> 16:54.403
Okay.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.243
Let's go kid. Hurry up.

17:00.275 --> 17:01.477
You're taking forever.

17:20.963 --> 17:24.500
Son of a bitch!

17:24.534 --> 17:26.236
Oh, jeez.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.407
Jesus.

18:01.270 --> 18:02.471
Let's go.

18:15.852 --> 18:16.987
Fuck!

18:25.862 --> 18:28.698
That's it right there.

18:28.730 --> 18:31.667
We were too late.

18:31.701 --> 18:34.336
Fuck!

18:34.369 --> 18:37.973
Why am I
so out of goddamn shape?

18:40.576 --> 18:42.813
Son of a bitch!

18:48.984 --> 18:50.086
See?

18:50.119 --> 18:53.522
See, here's where one of
the symbols is recreated.

18:53.556 --> 18:55.525
I think that's lambda.

18:55.557 --> 18:59.028
Don't make up names for things.

18:59.061 --> 19:01.430
And here's the other symbol.

19:03.365 --> 19:04.701
That's phi.

19:04.733 --> 19:07.836
Seriously, stop with the names.

19:07.869 --> 19:11.440
This right here...

19:11.473 --> 19:17.313
is essentially
a cell phone call to Abaddon.

19:17.346 --> 19:22.786
Lettin' 'em know
that it's that time.

19:22.818 --> 19:26.423
Next, possession,

19:26.455 --> 19:27.756
and then lastly,

19:27.789 --> 19:30.759
it's reincarnation
of him himself.

19:30.792 --> 19:35.798
And we just fucking missed him.

19:40.036 --> 19:41.371
Fuck!

19:43.573 --> 19:46.976
We were this close, kid.

19:47.009 --> 19:48.345
Just...

20:04.493 --> 20:07.529
Did you hear that, kid?

20:07.563 --> 20:08.832
Kid, did you hear that?

20:19.142 --> 20:21.678
Kid, are you hearing this?

20:21.711 --> 20:22.846
Where is it, kid?

20:29.719 --> 20:30.720
Where is it, kid?

20:35.525 --> 20:36.726
Over here, kid, come on.

20:44.534 --> 20:45.468
Over there!

20:52.074 --> 20:53.176
Wow!

20:56.778 --> 21:00.517
I see you.

21:00.549 --> 21:01.917
Yeah.

21:01.951 --> 21:04.187
Little elf-boy.

21:04.220 --> 21:08.857
And Lady Galadriel,
weave your cape.

21:08.891 --> 21:10.627
You getting this, Tyler?

21:13.628 --> 21:16.799
I got you.

21:16.833 --> 21:18.868
Yeah, I got you, Gandalf.

21:26.476 --> 21:29.012
Aren't we gonna chase him?

21:29.045 --> 21:30.779
No.

21:30.813 --> 21:33.082
They're just gonna
keep playing with us,

21:33.115 --> 21:36.752
lure us somewhere that
we don't wanna be right now.

21:36.786 --> 21:39.756
We gotta get going
before the sun goes down.

21:41.923 --> 21:43.725
That ritual that we just missed?

21:43.759 --> 21:46.462
That's exactly what we need
to film and document.

21:46.496 --> 21:47.697
Soon as we get that,

21:47.730 --> 21:49.865
we prove their existence,
kid.

21:49.898 --> 21:52.801
Okay? And we missed it.

21:52.835 --> 21:56.873
But...

21:56.905 --> 21:59.107
it's okay.

21:59.141 --> 22:02.010
Come over here.

22:02.044 --> 22:03.480
We're gonna get 'em,

22:03.512 --> 22:04.880
I think I figured
something out.

22:08.049 --> 22:09.685
So here's the ancient code.

22:09.719 --> 22:11.187
I think this could be
our guide to catching them

22:11.220 --> 22:13.222
in the act of the rituals.

22:13.256 --> 22:16.926
So I know everything
between here and here,

22:16.959 --> 22:19.762
and the middle bracket
all the way down,

22:19.795 --> 22:20.997
that's coordinates.

22:21.029 --> 22:22.197
I know that for a fact.

22:22.230 --> 22:24.000
I don't know what everything
on the left over here is,

22:24.032 --> 22:25.134
or on the right,

22:25.167 --> 22:29.505
but I know dead center
in the middle is coordinates.

22:29.538 --> 22:33.276
So all's not lost.

22:33.308 --> 22:34.911
We're gonna get 'em, kid.

22:39.548 --> 22:41.084
Dear video diary:

22:41.116 --> 22:43.720
It's me, Ty-Ty.

22:43.752 --> 22:44.920
Weird day.

22:44.953 --> 22:49.591
I mean, the weirdest part is
that this dude actually believes

22:49.625 --> 22:52.028
all the stuff
he's talking about.

22:52.060 --> 22:54.163
It's like
the Illuminati conspiracy.

22:54.195 --> 22:58.734
But cool part for me
is that it gives me a chance

22:58.768 --> 23:02.805
to actually do something good,

23:02.837 --> 23:07.911
gives me a shot to actually
shoot something professional.

23:07.943 --> 23:10.012
And that's what I'm gonna do.

23:10.046 --> 23:17.653
I'm gonna shoot this nutjob
and all his delusions, and...

23:17.686 --> 23:19.121
it's gonna fuckin' rock.

23:22.124 --> 23:24.826
We'll see what happens next.

23:24.859 --> 23:25.928
Ta-ta.

23:32.969 --> 23:34.604
So I'm gonna throw it at you.

23:34.636 --> 23:35.837
All right.

23:35.871 --> 23:38.608
- Right now? Okay.
- Yeah.

23:38.641 --> 23:40.977
Wait, I threw it
at the camera!

24:00.328 --> 24:02.264
Hey! Get... back up.

24:02.298 --> 24:04.701
I'm hormonal as fuck right now.

24:04.733 --> 24:05.934
Watch out.

24:07.737 --> 24:08.971
You know you like it.

24:09.005 --> 24:10.040
Just tell me you like it.

24:10.073 --> 24:11.374
Uh-huh. That's what
you like to tell yourself?

24:11.406 --> 24:13.875
Hey.

24:13.909 --> 24:15.244
I know what we're doing later.

24:15.277 --> 24:17.814
I'm on my period, dude!

24:17.846 --> 24:19.816
I'm gonna bring the camera.

24:19.848 --> 24:23.919
What? No! No.

24:29.157 --> 24:31.660
Rob, this is for you.

24:31.693 --> 24:34.062
I'm documenting that someone
broke into my fucking place

24:34.096 --> 24:36.732
and put this vial
in front of my flowers,

24:36.766 --> 24:39.035
my pretty flowers.

24:39.067 --> 24:40.702
Unless it was you, babe.

24:40.736 --> 24:42.105
What?

24:42.137 --> 24:43.839
Did you put that there?

24:43.873 --> 24:46.875
No. You already asked me this.

24:46.909 --> 24:49.045
Are you sure?

24:49.077 --> 24:51.279
Yeah.

24:51.313 --> 24:54.784
- It's very romantic.
- Cool.

24:54.817 --> 24:56.853
Why don't you drink it?

25:00.690 --> 25:03.026
Uh...

25:09.164 --> 25:10.365
Come in.

25:11.433 --> 25:12.434
Come in!

25:12.468 --> 25:14.371
Kid?

25:16.439 --> 25:18.841
This is... this is a mess.

25:18.874 --> 25:21.044
When's the last time
you cleaned up in here?

25:21.076 --> 25:23.211
Oh! Like the dog.

25:23.244 --> 25:25.814
I'll take a scotch.

25:25.847 --> 25:28.317
It's fuckin' noon, dude.

25:28.349 --> 25:30.385
That doesn't mean anything.
Where's it at?

25:30.419 --> 25:31.954
Let's go, sco...

25:31.987 --> 25:34.724
Somebody fucking broke into
my place last night

25:34.757 --> 25:37.860
and left this... I don't know
what the fuck this is, but...

25:37.893 --> 25:39.395
- fuck, dude.
- Shh!

25:42.364 --> 25:44.733
- Have you tried drinkin' it?
- No. What?

25:44.767 --> 25:46.836
I'll grab your camera
and I'll get a close-up.

25:46.868 --> 25:48.303
Go ahead and take
a little sip.

25:48.336 --> 25:50.173
This is your documentary, kid.

25:50.205 --> 25:51.740
This is one
of those opportunities,

25:51.773 --> 25:52.941
you know what I mean?

25:52.974 --> 25:54.242
I'm not going to drink this.

25:54.276 --> 25:56.245
There's nothing wrong with that.

25:56.278 --> 26:00.450
Promise you'll be fine.

26:00.482 --> 26:01.783
- Okay, if you're gonna be...
- Just a little sip,

26:01.817 --> 26:02.785
just a little sip.

26:02.817 --> 26:05.788
Nothing's gonna happen.

26:05.820 --> 26:06.955
Yeah, just a sip.

26:06.989 --> 26:08.156
And then look at camera
right after.

26:08.190 --> 26:09.792
I'm not gonna... like...

26:09.825 --> 26:12.128
I have no idea
what it's gonna be, I can't...

26:12.161 --> 26:16.732
If I thought for one second
it was harmful to you,

26:16.766 --> 26:18.134
absolutely not.

26:18.166 --> 26:20.836
I'm not a monster.

26:20.869 --> 26:22.237
There you go, cheers it.

26:22.270 --> 26:24.039
- Cheers.
- Cheers, buddy, there you go,

26:24.073 --> 26:25.441
let's try it.

26:25.473 --> 26:27.009
There's my big boy.

26:27.041 --> 26:28.176
There we go.

26:29.411 --> 26:31.114
- What did it taste like?
- I don't know, ugh.

26:31.146 --> 26:32.214
Okay, lemme see your eyes.

26:32.248 --> 26:34.083
Let me see your eyes,
look your eyes into the camera.

26:34.115 --> 26:35.951
Open them wide.

26:35.984 --> 26:37.786
Open 'em wide.

26:37.819 --> 26:40.255
- What?
- Oh.

26:40.288 --> 26:41.790
What?

26:41.824 --> 26:42.925
It's not poison, kid.

26:42.959 --> 26:45.260
- They're not trying to kill you.
- What the fuck, dude?

26:45.294 --> 26:46.829
You thought that
was gonna be poison?

26:46.862 --> 26:48.865
Ah, you never know.

26:48.897 --> 26:50.065
Could it be, like,
a late onset?

26:50.098 --> 26:52.434
Like, am I... are you sure
I'm gonna be okay?

26:52.468 --> 26:55.438
Yeah, it could be, but
I wouldn't worry about it, kid.

26:55.471 --> 26:57.807
Should I go to a... like,
should we go to a hospital?

26:57.839 --> 26:58.974
No, no!

26:59.008 --> 26:59.976
I got a place we're going.

27:00.009 --> 27:01.277
Where?

27:01.310 --> 27:03.178
You'll just have to follow me
with your camera and find out.

27:03.211 --> 27:06.081
Should I go to the hospital,
like, for real,

27:06.115 --> 27:08.049
just to see, like, if it...
if anything else...

27:08.083 --> 27:09.051
if something's bad?

27:09.084 --> 27:10.553
I don't want something
to be bad inside of me.

27:10.586 --> 27:13.990
Kid, you are totally fine, okay?

27:14.022 --> 27:16.224
Hey, stay with me here, kid.

27:16.258 --> 27:18.494
You're all good, baby.

27:18.527 --> 27:20.830
You're all good.

27:20.863 --> 27:22.865
Did it look cool, like,
when I drank it?

27:22.897 --> 27:24.366
It looked so cool, kid,
you're gonna look so cool.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.203
How the fuck
do we get outta here?

27:35.577 --> 27:38.381
This is where the coordinates
lead, pal, right here.

27:38.413 --> 27:41.983
We're gonna catch these fuckers
red-handed, huh, buddy?

27:42.017 --> 27:43.352
I don't fucking see
anything, dude.

27:43.384 --> 27:45.288
It looks like
an empty shitty house.

27:47.489 --> 27:50.526
What are those dogs barking at?

27:50.558 --> 27:53.195
Why do you think
they broke into my place?

27:53.229 --> 27:54.497
Why do I think they did that?

27:54.529 --> 27:55.530
- Yeah.
- Probably because

27:55.564 --> 27:56.999
we're getting close.

27:57.031 --> 27:58.366
Fuckin' L.A.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.304
Don't you wanna be
a famous director?

28:01.336 --> 28:05.508
Women, pussy, titties?

28:05.540 --> 28:08.243
Fuckin' golf whenever you want?

28:08.277 --> 28:11.447
I don't golf, dude, and
this isn't fucking good shit.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.981
I'm not getting anything.

28:13.015 --> 28:14.250
I'm getting you
staring at nothing.

28:14.282 --> 28:15.417
Hey. We're gonna get something.

28:15.451 --> 28:16.986
All right? I promise you that.

28:17.019 --> 28:17.853
This is the place.

28:17.886 --> 28:18.954
This is where
the coordinates were.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.556
I didn't rip fuckin'
Hippie Joe's floor up

28:20.588 --> 28:23.091
for nothing.

28:23.125 --> 28:26.162
I do feel bad about that,
for the record.

28:26.194 --> 28:27.864
Looks empty to me.

28:27.896 --> 28:30.298
But these are the coordinates!

28:30.332 --> 28:31.601
I'm not staying here all day.

28:31.634 --> 28:33.236
I'll show you it's empty.

28:33.269 --> 28:34.303
Hey, kid, wait.

28:34.336 --> 28:36.005
Wait! They'll see you! Hold on.

28:36.038 --> 28:37.874
Kid, hey, get back here!
They'll see you!

28:44.646 --> 28:46.514
No one's here.

28:54.623 --> 28:56.625
All right, Mr. Robert
"Finding cults is my hobby,"

28:56.659 --> 29:00.496
let me prove you were
wasting my time.

29:02.298 --> 29:05.201
Take a look.
Completely empty.

29:05.233 --> 29:09.170
No lights on. No cars.

29:09.203 --> 29:13.475
Looks completely abandoned.

29:15.411 --> 29:18.014
Ow. Pricker. Ow!

29:18.047 --> 29:19.148
Fuck roses.

29:22.718 --> 29:23.920
Locked gate.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.458
I just showed you
the footage. Rob.

29:29.490 --> 29:31.961
No one is home. It's empty.

29:31.993 --> 29:34.496
They are busy
breaking into my place.

29:34.529 --> 29:36.197
I know.

29:36.230 --> 29:37.266
It's not cool.

29:37.298 --> 29:38.200
I didn't sign up for this.

29:38.232 --> 29:41.037
I don't feel safe anymore.

29:41.069 --> 29:43.306
Tyler...

29:43.338 --> 29:47.108
the reason you don't feel safe
is because you're a pussy,

29:47.142 --> 29:48.243
and the reason you're a pussy

29:48.277 --> 29:50.947
is because you don't know
how to defend yourself.

29:50.980 --> 29:53.348
And I do want to help you
with that.

29:53.382 --> 29:55.718
I need you to stick with me,
kid.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.252
Okay?

29:57.286 --> 29:58.287
Stick with me,

29:58.320 --> 30:01.624
and I'm gonna teach you
how to defend yourself.

30:01.656 --> 30:03.291
By the time I'm done,

30:03.325 --> 30:04.593
you're gonna be having people
piss blood

30:04.625 --> 30:07.296
that break into your house.

30:08.430 --> 30:10.066
Okay?

30:10.098 --> 30:11.634
- Okay, it's...
- But I need you

30:11.666 --> 30:12.667
to stay here with me.

30:12.701 --> 30:16.238
We're on to something,
I promise you that.

30:16.270 --> 30:18.307
- Okay?
- All right.

30:18.339 --> 30:22.010
- It sounds kinda cool.
- Yeah, it's really cool.

30:22.044 --> 30:25.247
Especially the first time
you do it.

30:25.279 --> 30:29.085
Now, I know these are
the coordinates.

30:29.117 --> 30:32.721
I know this is the place.

30:32.755 --> 30:34.457
That might be the case,

30:34.490 --> 30:38.493
but right now,
it's empty, dude.

30:38.527 --> 30:40.395
That's what's throwing me off.

30:47.135 --> 30:48.636
All right, Rob,
I'm ready to fuckin' fight.

30:48.670 --> 30:53.042
I'm ready to fuckin'...
fuckin' do this.

30:53.075 --> 30:54.242
You hear that?

30:57.712 --> 31:01.049
The wild animals,
and a quinceañera,

31:01.083 --> 31:05.153
But the wild animals,
they're listening,

31:05.186 --> 31:08.590
because their life
depends on it, okay?

31:08.624 --> 31:10.692
Now, your life someday
very well might depend

31:10.726 --> 31:12.395
on what I'm about to teach you,

31:12.428 --> 31:15.364
so I need you to listen, okay?

31:15.396 --> 31:17.265
Now.

31:17.298 --> 31:18.800
One punch.

31:18.834 --> 31:21.137
Two punches is for cowards.

31:21.170 --> 31:23.105
Real men,
it only takes one.

31:23.137 --> 31:24.138
How does that sound, right?

31:24.173 --> 31:26.608
- Yeah, I wanna fuckin'...
- One punch, okay?

31:26.642 --> 31:28.443
Nobody's fuckin' breakin' in
to my house again!

31:28.477 --> 31:30.312
Yeah! Nobody's breakin' in
to your house again.

31:30.345 --> 31:32.748
Now, what you wanna do
is you wanna take this fist,

31:32.780 --> 31:35.817
and you wanna put right through
the bottom of the ribcage,

31:35.851 --> 31:36.919
right there.

31:36.951 --> 31:38.721
You wanna hit 'em really hard
right there, okay?

31:38.753 --> 31:40.155
Lemme see your fist.

31:40.189 --> 31:41.323
You wanna hit it right there.

31:41.355 --> 31:43.558
Yeah. Dude,
that kinda hurt already.

31:43.592 --> 31:45.294
That already hurt, right?

31:45.326 --> 31:46.694
So that's the first part.

31:46.728 --> 31:47.829
Okay.

31:47.863 --> 31:49.731
The second part... why don't
you put your hood on?

31:49.765 --> 31:51.167
Okay, why am I
putting my hood on?

31:51.200 --> 31:54.069
Oh, fuck!

31:54.103 --> 31:56.172
Deception!

31:58.406 --> 32:00.308
You're not gonna like what comes
out of your pee-pee hole, kid.

32:02.277 --> 32:05.146
What the fuck's gonna come
out of my pee-pee hole?

32:17.759 --> 32:19.394
Hey, kid.

32:19.428 --> 32:22.431
You did good today, all right?

32:22.463 --> 32:24.332
And don't worry,
we're gonna get 'em.

32:24.365 --> 32:26.134
Now. If you're gonna be
following me around,

32:26.167 --> 32:28.269
I can't have you
looking like a hobo.

32:28.303 --> 32:32.508
I had my girl over in the bazaar
in Little Armenia

32:32.540 --> 32:34.676
make you this shirt custom.

32:34.710 --> 32:37.513
Wear it, okay?

32:37.546 --> 32:39.782
- Thanks?
- Now get outta here.

32:39.815 --> 32:43.853
Get outta here.
I got stuff to do.

33:06.741 --> 33:08.676
What a day.

33:29.730 --> 33:31.901
Anybody here?

34:02.297 --> 34:03.832
Hello?

34:05.800 --> 34:07.336
Hello!

34:43.271 --> 34:46.342
Hello?

34:54.349 --> 34:56.619
Nope!

34:56.652 --> 34:59.855
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.

34:59.887 --> 35:01.889
Nope!

35:01.922 --> 35:03.891
Nope.

35:03.925 --> 35:06.461
Nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope, nope...

35:27.682 --> 35:29.951
Hey, Nova.

35:31.585 --> 35:33.354
Leia!

35:34.389 --> 35:35.791
You home?

35:37.592 --> 35:38.794
Babe?

35:54.909 --> 35:56.077
Babe?

37:17.492 --> 37:18.927
Jesus, it took you long enough.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.561
Okay; right place, wrong time.

37:20.594 --> 37:22.530
Let's go.

37:22.563 --> 37:25.033
Good job, you didn't break
rule number one.

37:26.768 --> 37:28.971
Let's go!

37:29.003 --> 37:31.507
How do you get outta here?

37:43.717 --> 37:47.455
Let's check it out, kid.

37:53.994 --> 37:54.829
All right, kid.

37:54.862 --> 37:55.931
You can hop this, right?

37:55.963 --> 37:57.799
No, I cannot.

37:57.833 --> 37:59.568
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

37:59.601 --> 38:00.669
Wow.

38:00.702 --> 38:01.703
I'll squeeze through the gate.

38:01.737 --> 38:04.606
Thank God you weren't
in Sumatra in '04.

38:04.639 --> 38:05.874
Up, up, and away.

38:29.731 --> 38:31.700
Shh!

38:47.148 --> 38:49.585
Rob! Do you see anything?

38:49.617 --> 38:52.520
Nothing. Let's keep going.

38:56.190 --> 38:59.461
Goddammit, kid. Watch it!

39:10.838 --> 39:12.974
Okay.

39:13.007 --> 39:14.675
Okay, kid, let's go check
over there, come on.

39:14.708 --> 39:17.812
With me, let's go.

39:17.846 --> 39:19.614
Come on.

39:19.648 --> 39:20.883
Get over here.

39:25.219 --> 39:28.789
Okay.

39:28.822 --> 39:30.826
Come on, kid.

39:44.306 --> 39:45.641
Kid, kid, kid, come here.

39:45.673 --> 39:49.878
Try to get in there,
try to get in there.

39:49.911 --> 39:51.646
Go around.

40:17.972 --> 40:20.909
This is what eternity
looks like, kid.

40:30.952 --> 40:35.123
Hey! All the lights
in the front houses are on.

40:38.360 --> 40:40.028
Rob, you're gonna get us caught!

40:43.164 --> 40:44.199
Did you just...

40:44.231 --> 40:46.802
Yeah. I pulled out a pipe.

40:51.206 --> 40:54.343
Oh my God, this is it, kid.

40:54.376 --> 40:56.311
This is it.

42:04.344 --> 42:05.346
Oh, shit!

42:05.380 --> 42:07.115
Run, run, go, go!

42:07.148 --> 42:08.916
- Oh my God. Oh my God.
- Let's go. Hurry up!

42:08.949 --> 42:10.384
Run, run, run!

42:10.418 --> 42:12.421
Rob, run! Run, run, run.

42:12.454 --> 42:14.289
Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

42:17.157 --> 42:17.925
Holy shit, they're coming.

42:17.958 --> 42:18.826
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God.

42:18.860 --> 42:19.661
They're coming,
they're coming...

42:19.693 --> 42:21.228
Come on,
what's taking so long?

42:21.262 --> 42:22.063
I'm stuck!

42:22.096 --> 42:23.063
Well, squeeze your fat ass
through!

42:23.097 --> 42:23.865
I can't get through,
I can't get through.

42:23.898 --> 42:24.731
- Get me outta here!
- Push, push!

42:24.766 --> 42:27.068
- I'm pushing.
- Well, push harder!

42:27.101 --> 42:29.437
Pull harder!

42:29.471 --> 42:31.173
They're coming, they're coming,
they're coming,

42:31.206 --> 42:33.041
they're coming...

42:34.342 --> 42:38.113
You better have got that
on camera, kid.

43:01.503 --> 43:05.374
Kid, just tell me
one more time.

43:06.974 --> 43:08.743
Did you get that on camera?

43:08.777 --> 43:11.346
I got it on camera.

43:16.550 --> 43:18.152
Damn, kid.

43:18.186 --> 43:21.021
I fucking love you.

43:21.054 --> 43:22.490
Come over here.

43:22.523 --> 43:24.259
That was it.

43:26.494 --> 43:29.097
She was the sacrifice,
and that is a damn shame

43:29.130 --> 43:30.865
because she wasn't
too bad looking.

43:30.898 --> 43:33.367
She had bloody eyes.

43:33.400 --> 43:35.136
Yeah.

43:35.170 --> 43:37.139
She did.

43:37.172 --> 43:39.974
Well, through that glory hole

43:40.007 --> 43:41.509
that I blew through
the side of the wall,

43:41.543 --> 43:43.878
we were able to get a glimpse
into their existence.

43:43.911 --> 43:45.446
Not just their existence.

43:45.480 --> 43:50.018
One of their most sacred
rituals, for God's sakes.

43:50.050 --> 43:51.786
This is huge.

43:53.320 --> 43:55.356
I don't want to scare you, kid,

43:55.389 --> 43:59.360
but things might start
getting more dangerous.

43:59.393 --> 44:03.197
Right here, we have
the coordinates, all right?

44:03.231 --> 44:05.066
Starting at the three
we have coordinates.

44:05.099 --> 44:07.001
This was their first ritual.

44:07.034 --> 44:08.803
Now, we came down,
we missed that one.

44:08.836 --> 44:09.838
We weren't there on time.

44:09.871 --> 44:10.905
This is the second one.

44:10.938 --> 44:14.175
Coordinates. Right,
you got these four numbers.

44:14.208 --> 44:17.244
So, right here,
it's reverse military time.

44:17.277 --> 44:20.014
2-1-3-0. Reverse that.

44:20.047 --> 44:21.816
What time is it?

44:21.849 --> 44:23.251
The exact time
that we were there.

44:25.619 --> 44:27.522
Not really a Scotch guy.

44:29.190 --> 44:31.393
Dude, I'm not gonna
fucking drink this.

44:31.425 --> 44:33.128
Cheers, kid.

44:40.534 --> 44:43.370
Hey, kid, look at this.

44:43.403 --> 44:46.307
Look at my balancing skills.

44:57.318 --> 44:59.187
I do what I want, Rob.

44:59.219 --> 45:02.089
This is my movie.

45:06.960 --> 45:09.063
- Talking to yourself?
- What? No, I'm talking...

45:09.097 --> 45:11.533
I'm just editing footage
for Rob.

45:11.565 --> 45:12.967
- Okay.
- Yeah.

45:13.001 --> 45:14.436
This looks pretty gnarly.

45:14.469 --> 45:16.972
Yeah, he is an ugly guy.

45:17.005 --> 45:18.139
No, that's not what I meant.

45:18.172 --> 45:21.443
I meant, like,
this is some crazy shit.

45:21.476 --> 45:22.878
He spent all of his life,

45:22.911 --> 45:24.880
like, just trying
to follow cults.

45:24.913 --> 45:25.614
This is all pretend.

45:25.646 --> 45:27.215
It's not real.

45:27.248 --> 45:29.416
- Don't be worried.
- I don't know.

45:29.449 --> 45:31.886
It's all just a bunch of stuff
to sell books.

45:31.920 --> 45:34.188
- It's nothing.
- I don't...

45:34.222 --> 45:36.224
You got to be careful
with that stuff.

45:36.257 --> 45:38.226
It's all for show.

45:38.259 --> 45:41.061
This cult isn't that hardcore.

45:41.094 --> 45:45.165
Yeah, I'm sleeping
with the lights on tonight.

48:14.748 --> 48:17.585
Damn it, it's the screen door.

48:22.090 --> 48:24.326
Holy shit.

48:28.228 --> 48:30.064
Oh my God!

48:30.097 --> 48:32.132
What the... what the...

48:33.601 --> 48:37.505
Okay, I have you on camera.

48:37.538 --> 48:39.507
Do you want to talk about this?

48:39.539 --> 48:40.407
Do you want a spritzer?

48:40.440 --> 48:41.842
Do you want a soda?

48:41.876 --> 48:43.078
I don't have any soda.

48:43.110 --> 48:44.278
Cutting down on sugar.

48:44.311 --> 48:45.380
I don't know
what the fuck you want.

48:45.413 --> 48:46.713
Get the fuck...

48:54.856 --> 48:56.724
Where...

48:56.757 --> 49:00.528
What the... what the...

49:00.561 --> 49:01.796
Where...

49:13.240 --> 49:15.143
Ah, fuck me.

49:15.175 --> 49:16.543
Fuck.

49:16.577 --> 49:17.779
Hey, Rob, we need to stop,

49:17.811 --> 49:19.279
people are breaking into my
house.

49:19.313 --> 49:22.182
This is not... I can't...
I can't do this anymore.

49:22.215 --> 49:23.550
That was good,
that was the one.

49:23.583 --> 49:27.154
That's the one,
go with that one.

49:27.188 --> 49:30.157
I got to talk to you
seriously, Rob.

49:30.190 --> 49:32.126
Yeah?

49:32.159 --> 49:33.694
I don't know
if I can do this anymore.

49:33.728 --> 49:36.231
Oh, kid, come on,
don't give me that.

49:36.264 --> 49:39.634
Somebody broke into my place
yesterday again,

49:39.666 --> 49:43.471
and this time
they fucking attacked me.

49:43.503 --> 49:45.172
Did they attack you
with weapons?

49:45.206 --> 49:46.474
No. He, like...

49:46.507 --> 49:48.242
Kid, this is a good thing.

49:48.275 --> 49:50.577
This means we're getting close.

49:50.610 --> 49:51.879
This is great news.

49:51.913 --> 49:53.514
Hop in the car.

49:53.547 --> 49:55.883
Let's go!

49:55.916 --> 49:59.253
Okay, kid, this is
a good thing, all right?

49:59.286 --> 50:01.321
There's no version
where this is a good thing.

50:01.355 --> 50:03.858
Like, someone came
into my place, attacked me.

50:03.891 --> 50:06.161
I don't feel safe anymore.

50:06.193 --> 50:08.529
I'm not... you're not
even fucking paying me.

50:08.563 --> 50:11.365
Kid, look at me.

50:11.398 --> 50:12.866
When was one time in your life

50:12.900 --> 50:15.537
that you actually did
feel safe?

50:17.438 --> 50:18.840
I don't know
how to answer that, Rob.

50:18.873 --> 50:21.509
Exactly. Never.

50:21.541 --> 50:23.478
And we both know why.

50:23.510 --> 50:26.213
Okay, so it doesn't take
a lot to scare you.

50:26.246 --> 50:30.551
But believe me, when you start
getting close to shit,

50:30.585 --> 50:33.221
people start messing
with you more, man.

50:33.253 --> 50:34.121
That's how this works.

50:34.155 --> 50:36.658
I told you it was
gonna be dangerous.

50:36.690 --> 50:40.527
Now we are on the trail.

50:40.561 --> 50:41.563
Okay?

50:41.596 --> 50:43.697
You're a badass filmmaker.

50:43.731 --> 50:46.201
You're a documentarian,
dammit.

50:46.233 --> 50:48.268
So now is not the time to quit.

50:48.302 --> 50:52.373
Now is the time to throw it
into fourth gear, baby.

50:52.405 --> 50:53.974
All right?

50:54.007 --> 50:55.943
Fourth gear? No.

50:57.844 --> 50:59.480
Overdrive.

51:10.757 --> 51:13.427
Got to get some gas here
real quick, Tyler.

51:13.460 --> 51:14.761
No, bitch, keep going.

51:14.795 --> 51:16.331
Keep fucking going.

51:16.364 --> 51:18.465
No, I'm staying here.

51:18.498 --> 51:19.466
You keep on moving.

51:19.500 --> 51:20.969
It's like an 80-year-old woman
in there.

51:21.001 --> 51:22.903
I know. Fucking old people,
right?

51:36.349 --> 51:38.552
What?

51:38.585 --> 51:40.320
That's that fucking car
from the other night,

51:40.353 --> 51:42.556
right there, guaranteed.

51:42.590 --> 51:44.858
That's it! I need you to go
in there and look inside.

51:44.891 --> 51:45.625
See if you find anything.

51:45.659 --> 51:47.494
- What? Me?
- Just go open the door.

51:47.527 --> 51:50.430
You think that piece of shit
has locks that work on it?

51:50.463 --> 51:51.932
Look at the bumper.
Of course it doesn't.

51:51.965 --> 51:53.934
Just go open the door,
peek inside.

51:53.967 --> 51:56.603
I'm gonna watch the door
of the food mart

51:56.637 --> 51:58.306
to make sure he doesn't
come out and get you, okay?

51:58.338 --> 52:00.340
- No, I'll be on watch.
- And I'm gonna film you.

52:00.373 --> 52:01.207
This is gonna be your moment.

52:01.242 --> 52:03.044
You're gonna look
so fucking cool.

52:03.077 --> 52:04.779
- You're gonna film it?
- I'm gonna film you.

52:04.811 --> 52:07.447
You are gonna look
so cool, man.

52:07.481 --> 52:08.716
- Come on.
- That would be...

52:08.748 --> 52:10.317
It will be really cool, right?

52:10.351 --> 52:12.019
- Okay. All right.
- Yes. Okay.

52:14.889 --> 52:15.789
No, I can't do it, I can't.

52:15.824 --> 52:17.692
If he comes out,
I'll protect you. Go.

52:17.724 --> 52:18.960
- I can't fucking do this, dude.
- Just go.

52:18.992 --> 52:20.061
Look inside!

52:20.094 --> 52:21.561
Give me the camera.

52:21.594 --> 52:23.664
Go, go!

52:23.697 --> 52:24.965
Go. Go, Tyler, go.

52:24.998 --> 52:25.932
You got this.

52:25.965 --> 52:27.367
You're the best.

52:27.400 --> 52:28.769
Go, go, go.

52:28.802 --> 52:30.538
Yeah.

52:35.041 --> 52:36.610
Come on, there we go.

52:36.643 --> 52:38.779
The coast is clear, kid,
come on. Let's go.

52:38.813 --> 52:41.349
Get your little dirty ass
in that truck.

52:41.382 --> 52:43.451
Yes! I knew
it would be unlocked.

52:43.483 --> 52:44.619
All right, there you go.

52:44.652 --> 52:46.854
Bada bing, bada boom.

52:46.887 --> 52:47.955
What the hell
is taking so long, kid?

52:47.987 --> 52:50.692
Come on, you should've
been out of there by now.

52:52.425 --> 52:53.326
Wait, no, why are you looking
in the tr...

52:53.360 --> 52:55.862
Okay, yeah, check the bed
of the truck.

52:55.896 --> 52:58.365
Wait, now where
you going now, kid?

52:58.398 --> 52:59.833
Kid, what the hell
are you doing?

52:59.867 --> 53:01.669
You don't need to go
to the other door.

53:01.702 --> 53:03.037
What the fuck is he doing?

53:03.070 --> 53:06.007
Are you lost?

53:06.039 --> 53:07.675
A little bit faster, a little
sense of urgency here, kid,

53:07.708 --> 53:09.844
come on, let's go.

53:12.780 --> 53:16.318
Wait a second, that looks
like he could be the guy.

53:18.753 --> 53:19.653
Wait, that is the guy.

53:19.688 --> 53:21.989
That's the son of a bitch
right there.

53:22.021 --> 53:23.990
Okay, let's get the fuck
out of here, dude.

53:24.023 --> 53:25.726
Fuck, just fucking
get out of here.

53:25.760 --> 53:27.128
Fucking insane as shit.

53:27.161 --> 53:29.764
Look cool, be cool, man,
be cool.

53:29.797 --> 53:31.565
Why aren't we driving?
Why aren't we driving yet?

53:31.599 --> 53:33.101
Let's go.

53:42.510 --> 53:43.945
All right, kid,
settle the fuck down.

53:43.978 --> 53:45.579
- You got one?
- I fucking got something, dude.

53:45.612 --> 53:46.446
- You got it?
- Yeah.

53:46.480 --> 53:47.914
What did you get?

53:47.947 --> 53:49.449
What'd the inside of his car
look like?

53:49.483 --> 53:50.952
There was garbage everywhere.

53:50.985 --> 53:53.454
It looked like there would be
garbage everywhere.

53:53.487 --> 53:55.556
- Is he following us?
- Doubt it.

53:55.588 --> 53:56.724
How do you know?

53:56.757 --> 53:58.059
Well, actually, I don't know.

53:58.092 --> 54:00.862
This cult seems crafty.

54:00.894 --> 54:02.130
Pull over.
Let me fucking show you.

54:02.163 --> 54:03.865
Okay.

54:03.898 --> 54:06.968
Hold on

54:07.001 --> 54:08.603
Yeah, we're good.

54:08.635 --> 54:10.670
Nobody is on our tail.

54:10.704 --> 54:11.839
- Let's see what you got.
- I don't know,

54:11.871 --> 54:12.806
there was a bunch of shit
in his car,

54:12.840 --> 54:14.909
but this looked like
it could be something.

54:14.942 --> 54:16.943
What do you got here?

54:18.945 --> 54:20.981
What do you think it is?

54:25.518 --> 54:27.454
I have no idea.

54:28.688 --> 54:30.824
But I know somebody who will.

54:32.726 --> 54:35.697
We got to get my bolo tie.

54:37.864 --> 54:39.633
Am I going too fast?
I can't even hear you, kid.

54:39.666 --> 54:41.435
You got to stay up with me.
Let's go, come on.

54:41.469 --> 54:43.171
- You're, like, power walking.
- I got to get changed.

54:43.204 --> 54:44.872
Is that yours?

54:44.905 --> 54:46.107
Yeah, don't worry
about the car.

54:46.139 --> 54:47.974
- Sweet.
- Yeah, ain't too bad.

54:48.007 --> 54:49.876
That's a 1970 Cougar.

54:49.909 --> 54:52.179
- Can I drive it?
- No, absolutely not.

54:54.748 --> 54:57.184
So these are the cars
I'm working on right now.

54:57.217 --> 55:02.123
This is a 1971
VW Beetle Baja.

55:02.155 --> 55:05.159
- Nice.
- So they...

55:05.192 --> 55:07.929
What we got here is I chopped
the whole back end off

55:07.961 --> 55:11.865
so I could just slam
a big old, uh,

55:11.898 --> 55:14.134
what is it, 1915cc engine
onto it.

55:14.168 --> 55:15.603
It's beautiful.

55:15.635 --> 55:17.204
And, uh, changed out
all this stuff:

55:17.237 --> 55:22.242
the interior, dash,
front tie rods.

55:22.275 --> 55:25.745
And, then, back here
I got a Jaguar.

55:25.778 --> 55:27.581
So, uh, when you're at home,
you just...

55:27.614 --> 55:29.683
this is what you do,
you just fix cool cars?

55:29.717 --> 55:31.117
Yeah.

55:31.150 --> 55:34.888
I don't even drive 'em
half the time after I finish.

55:34.922 --> 55:36.123
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

55:36.155 --> 55:37.625
I just like working on 'em, kid.

55:37.657 --> 55:39.259
Something about it, I guess.

55:39.293 --> 55:42.163
Just calms me down.

55:42.195 --> 55:43.764
Can I drive it?

55:43.797 --> 55:45.833
No. No.

55:45.865 --> 55:48.068
God, no, kid,
these engines are huge.

55:48.101 --> 55:50.570
Why isn't this
in any of your books?

55:50.603 --> 55:52.506
Ah...

55:52.539 --> 55:54.541
I got to go change.

55:54.574 --> 55:55.842
Wait there.

55:55.876 --> 55:57.211
And don't touch anything.

56:06.152 --> 56:08.255
"Rrr."

56:17.331 --> 56:19.666
I'm Rob. I fix things.

56:19.699 --> 56:21.001
Bo, bo, bo.

56:21.034 --> 56:23.237
Click, click, click.

56:30.010 --> 56:31.813
Ah!

56:36.115 --> 56:38.152
That's right, Rob.

56:44.592 --> 56:45.960
All right.

56:45.992 --> 56:48.529
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-choo!

56:52.199 --> 56:54.268
Oh, hey.

56:54.300 --> 56:55.802
What you doing over there?

56:55.835 --> 56:58.271
Need a ride?

56:58.304 --> 57:00.307
Yeah, it's mine.

57:00.340 --> 57:02.676
I put it together myself.

57:02.710 --> 57:05.112
I fix cars, you know.

57:05.144 --> 57:06.614
It's just a hobby.

57:06.646 --> 57:09.616
It's what I do
in my spare time.

57:09.650 --> 57:11.318
What are you doing, kid?

57:11.351 --> 57:14.321
You know, playing,
playing around.

57:14.355 --> 57:15.822
This is a cool car
you got here.

57:15.856 --> 57:17.725
Really cool car.

57:17.757 --> 57:19.693
Yeah, this baby will go
off-roading in the desert.

57:19.726 --> 57:23.364
Baja Bugs,
really versatile vehicles.

57:23.396 --> 57:25.699
So, are you ready to go?

57:25.733 --> 57:27.101
Ready to go. Hop in.

57:27.134 --> 57:28.235
- Let's get out of here.
- Where are we going?

57:28.268 --> 57:30.070
- I'm driving.
- Oh, yeah?

57:30.103 --> 57:31.672
Where are we going
in your imagination?

57:31.704 --> 57:34.275
Uh, kind of just
picked up a lady.

57:34.307 --> 57:36.344
Maybe she has a friend,
you know.

57:36.376 --> 57:38.746
Two ladies, I like it.

57:38.778 --> 57:40.246
Do you know how to drive
stick shift?

57:40.280 --> 57:43.818
Uh, no, I do not,
unfortunately.

57:43.851 --> 57:45.251
Mm.

57:45.284 --> 57:47.821
How do you not know
how to drive stick shift?

57:47.855 --> 57:50.157
I feel like
that's like a thing

57:50.190 --> 57:53.994
a dad teaches his son,
you know?

57:54.027 --> 57:56.262
I never really...

57:56.295 --> 57:58.698
My dad wasn't... I didn't
really have a dad growing up,

57:58.731 --> 57:59.833
so I didn't
really get to learn

57:59.867 --> 58:01.102
how to drive stick shifts

58:01.135 --> 58:05.373
or play baseball.

58:05.405 --> 58:07.842
You were raised by your mother?

58:07.875 --> 58:10.978
- Yeah.
- That makes sense.

58:11.010 --> 58:13.279
What is that supposed to mean?

58:13.313 --> 58:16.349
It's not a bad thing.
It just means you're, you know,

58:16.382 --> 58:19.185
in touch with your feelings
and...

58:19.219 --> 58:20.721
And that's...

58:22.088 --> 58:23.157
That's good.

58:23.190 --> 58:28.095
You know, it's a lot harder
to teach compassion

58:28.128 --> 58:32.033
and vulnerability
than it is to teach somebody

58:32.065 --> 58:35.935
how to drive stick shift
or work on a car, you know?

58:35.969 --> 58:38.405
So those are strengths
that you have

58:38.438 --> 58:42.009
even though
you might not think so.

58:42.041 --> 58:45.246
And I don't fully think so,
but...

58:45.278 --> 58:46.847
...there is some strength

58:46.880 --> 58:50.951
in having those qualities.

58:50.983 --> 58:53.820
Uh, think you could teach me
how to drive stick shift?

58:53.853 --> 58:55.056
Absolutely, kid.
I'll tell you what,

58:55.088 --> 58:56.157
when we get back
from this thing,

58:56.190 --> 58:57.258
I'm gonna teach you
how to drive a stick shift.

58:57.291 --> 58:59.293
No problem, you're gonna be
driving stick shift

58:59.326 --> 59:00.561
in ten minutes.

59:00.594 --> 59:03.831
And I'll teach you what, uh,
everything on this engine is.

59:03.864 --> 59:05.733
Coil, distributor cap.

59:05.766 --> 59:06.634
I don't care about that.

59:06.666 --> 59:08.201
I mostly just want to drive
your car.

59:08.235 --> 59:11.105
Also, I put these clamps
on my nipples

59:11.137 --> 59:15.375
and I think they are filled
with electricity, so...

59:34.894 --> 59:37.398
Nice glasses, Rob.

59:37.431 --> 59:41.034
You look, uh, kind of nerdy.

59:41.068 --> 59:42.436
I like it.

59:42.469 --> 59:44.804
Okay, get it all...
get it all out right now.

59:44.838 --> 59:45.940
Get it out right now.
I have to wear 'em

59:45.972 --> 59:47.240
for long car rides.

59:47.273 --> 59:48.909
It's a curse.

59:48.942 --> 59:49.909
So do you really know someone

59:49.943 --> 59:51.746
who can identify this gemstone?

59:51.778 --> 59:53.179
Yes, I know a woman.

59:53.213 --> 59:55.149
Who?

59:55.181 --> 59:58.218
- My wife.
- Who?

59:58.251 --> 59:59.219
My wife.

59:59.253 --> 01:00:01.355
Are you... are you saying a name?
I can't hear...

01:00:01.387 --> 01:00:03.990
My wife, Tyler, okay.

01:00:04.023 --> 01:00:05.326
My wife.

01:00:05.358 --> 01:00:06.494
You have a wife?

01:00:06.527 --> 01:00:09.028
Yes, I do have a wife.

01:00:09.061 --> 01:00:11.798
I had no idea.
Are you guys separated?

01:00:11.831 --> 01:00:13.833
- What's the deal?
- No. Yes.

01:00:13.867 --> 01:00:15.836
- Ooh.
- But we're only separated

01:00:15.869 --> 01:00:17.238
because Jackie Bear
hasn't forgiven me

01:00:17.271 --> 01:00:19.507
and taken me back yet,
that's the only reason.

01:00:19.539 --> 01:00:20.840
Jackie Bear.

01:00:20.873 --> 01:00:23.009
Don't you ever say Jackie Bear.

01:00:23.043 --> 01:00:25.246
It's Miss goddamn Regis to you.

01:00:25.278 --> 01:00:26.780
Okay?

01:00:26.813 --> 01:00:29.282
Sure, sorry. I mean...

01:00:29.315 --> 01:00:30.984
Yeah, okay.

01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:31.918
Do you think she can help?

01:00:31.952 --> 01:00:33.054
Do you think she can
check out this gemstone?

01:00:33.086 --> 01:00:34.822
Yes, she's gonna... she's gonna
be able to help.

01:00:34.855 --> 01:00:36.791
But what about you?
Do you got a girlfriend?

01:00:36.824 --> 01:00:38.057
Uh, yeah.

01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:41.027
Is she a pillow, Tyler?

01:00:41.061 --> 01:00:42.363
No, she's a person.

01:00:42.396 --> 01:00:43.798
- She's real?
- Yeah.

01:00:43.831 --> 01:00:45.132
Okay, so she's not a pillow?

01:00:45.164 --> 01:00:46.534
She is absolutely not a pillow.

01:00:46.567 --> 01:00:49.068
Okay, okay, all right.

01:00:49.101 --> 01:00:51.038
That sounds good.

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:53.273
Why are we pulling over?

01:00:56.844 --> 01:00:58.445
I don't ever want you
to let your girlfriend go,

01:00:58.478 --> 01:01:00.347
your fake girlfriend, but when
you find a real girlfriend,

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.516
I don't ever want you
to let her go, okay?

01:01:02.548 --> 01:01:04.184
Listen to me right now,
this is important.

01:01:04.217 --> 01:01:05.251
Two reasons.

01:01:05.284 --> 01:01:06.520
One...

01:01:08.188 --> 01:01:09.390
The loss of one's true love

01:01:09.422 --> 01:01:11.357
is the act of drowning
on dry land

01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:13.460
in a stream of endless tears
that form in the ocean

01:01:13.492 --> 01:01:15.295
and then that ocean
is your heart

01:01:15.329 --> 01:01:19.066
and your soul that lives
on a tiny little island.

01:01:19.099 --> 01:01:22.036
And it's a sad, sad place.

01:01:22.068 --> 01:01:25.873
That was shockingly poetic, Rob.

01:01:25.905 --> 01:01:28.241
Where did you learn that from?

01:01:30.543 --> 01:01:33.947
I read it on a Beanie Baby
that Jackie Bear gave me.

01:01:35.449 --> 01:01:37.017
And number two:

01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:38.285
I don't think you would
ever find another pillow

01:01:38.318 --> 01:01:40.054
that will accept you
for who you are.

01:01:40.086 --> 01:01:41.855
- She's not a pillow.
- She is a pillow, my friend.

01:01:41.889 --> 01:01:43.490
She is as not a pillow
as it gets.

01:01:43.523 --> 01:01:44.358
She's a human being.

01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:46.360
Okay, okay.

01:01:46.393 --> 01:01:47.628
Let's get going here.

01:01:47.661 --> 01:01:49.230
All right.

01:01:49.262 --> 01:01:53.000
You know,
since you're such a wise sage

01:01:53.032 --> 01:01:55.368
about advice
on relationships and love,

01:01:55.402 --> 01:01:57.871
why don't we talk
about the Abaddon disciples

01:01:57.905 --> 01:02:00.173
and how fucking cool
it would be to live forever?

01:02:00.206 --> 01:02:01.875
It would not be cool
to live forever, Tyler.

01:02:01.909 --> 01:02:02.844
What are you talking about?

01:02:02.876 --> 01:02:05.612
Dying is like
the scariest thing in the world.

01:02:05.646 --> 01:02:08.282
Tyler, I embrace it.

01:02:08.315 --> 01:02:10.517
I'm not scared of it.

01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:12.452
I know it will come my way
eventually.

01:02:12.485 --> 01:02:13.987
And let me tell you something,
when it does,

01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:16.156
I'm not gonna go out
like some bitch.

01:02:16.188 --> 01:02:18.259
I ain't going out
with old age.

01:02:18.291 --> 01:02:19.927
I ain't going out
with syphilis.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.297
I saw how that shit works
over on the islands.

01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:24.898
I'm gonna have
my goddamn head bashed in.

01:02:24.931 --> 01:02:26.567
I'm gonna have my guts
ripped out, Tyler.

01:02:26.599 --> 01:02:29.502
That's how I'm going out.

01:02:29.536 --> 01:02:32.172
Mm, 'kay, well, not me.

01:02:32.204 --> 01:02:34.507
I'll take never dying.

01:02:34.541 --> 01:02:37.010
Well, guess what, Tyler,
if you never died,

01:02:37.043 --> 01:02:38.578
pretty soon
you would find yourself

01:02:38.612 --> 01:02:41.949
in a habitation pod on Mars
masturbating relentlessly

01:02:41.981 --> 01:02:43.684
because you got
nothing better to do.

01:02:43.717 --> 01:02:45.519
Could be worse.

01:03:16.449 --> 01:03:19.585
My Jackie Bear's humble abode.

01:03:19.619 --> 01:03:23.090
She's gonna be so pumped
to see me.

01:03:33.199 --> 01:03:35.135
Jackie Bear?

01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:40.007
Jackie Bear...

01:03:42.108 --> 01:03:43.710
Oh, shit!

01:03:45.344 --> 01:03:47.113
You're so beautiful.

01:03:47.146 --> 01:03:49.650
- Ugh.
- You're so beautiful.

01:03:49.682 --> 01:03:51.085
I love what you did
with your hair.

01:03:51.117 --> 01:03:52.219
I love what you're wearing.

01:03:52.251 --> 01:03:53.554
God.

01:03:53.586 --> 01:03:55.556
I have missed you so much.

01:03:55.588 --> 01:03:57.357
I really have.

01:03:57.391 --> 01:03:58.992
I'm so happy to see you.

01:03:59.025 --> 01:04:01.427
- Really?
- I am.

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.129
What do you want?

01:04:03.163 --> 01:04:05.465
I would like to be
part of your life again.

01:04:05.498 --> 01:04:06.699
I love this.

01:04:06.733 --> 01:04:09.135
I love your little
shitty trailer.

01:04:09.168 --> 01:04:11.204
I love... I love it, okay?

01:04:11.237 --> 01:04:13.506
It just...

01:04:13.539 --> 01:04:15.375
It feels like a home.

01:04:15.409 --> 01:04:17.711
I'm not gonna lie,
it makes it really hard for me

01:04:17.744 --> 01:04:19.113
to look at you right now,

01:04:19.146 --> 01:04:21.115
realizing I left
such a beautiful woman.

01:04:21.148 --> 01:04:23.083
- Hm.
- Yes.

01:04:23.115 --> 01:04:25.652
So my intelligence
or my knack for rocks

01:04:25.684 --> 01:04:27.387
or any of my degrees
doesn't matter?

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.155
It's just my boobs?

01:04:30.556 --> 01:04:32.759
Ah, it's...

01:04:32.793 --> 01:04:35.028
...all of it.

01:04:35.061 --> 01:04:36.130
And...

01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:41.268
And I've always loved you,
and I'm sorry, okay?

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:42.735
He did say great things
about you in the car.

01:04:42.768 --> 01:04:44.203
Really?

01:04:44.237 --> 01:04:46.139
Tyler, has he told you
some stories?

01:04:46.172 --> 01:04:47.407
Some good ones.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.410
There was that one time
in Mexico, remember,

01:04:50.443 --> 01:04:52.612
when you ended up
running around bare-ass

01:04:52.646 --> 01:04:54.581
with a bottle of tequila
hanging out of it?

01:04:54.614 --> 01:04:55.715
Hey.

01:04:55.748 --> 01:04:58.317
It was really, really beautiful.

01:04:58.351 --> 01:05:01.688
Why don't you tell Tyler about
the whiskey bottle up there?

01:05:01.721 --> 01:05:03.556
You mean tequila bottle.

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:05.826
Cheers to that.

01:05:05.858 --> 01:05:08.061
- Come on.
- There's the door. Go.

01:05:08.094 --> 01:05:10.063
Baby, there's something
really good here.

01:05:10.097 --> 01:05:13.367
And I love you,

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:17.104
and I've always loved you,
and I'm sorry, okay?

01:05:17.137 --> 01:05:18.405
What would change?

01:05:18.438 --> 01:05:20.706
Everything would change.

01:05:20.739 --> 01:05:21.841
Everything.

01:05:21.875 --> 01:05:24.478
Everything.
I would pick you first.

01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:26.612
Okay, I would never pick
my work over you.

01:05:26.646 --> 01:05:28.515
I would always do
what you want to do.

01:05:28.547 --> 01:05:29.849
We would chase your dreams.

01:05:29.882 --> 01:05:31.317
And, I mean, what do you want
to change?

01:05:31.351 --> 01:05:32.452
What else?

01:05:32.485 --> 01:05:33.519
You would be first.

01:05:33.552 --> 01:05:35.221
It would be Jackie Bear first.

01:05:35.255 --> 01:05:37.090
That would be
the Rob Regis policy,

01:05:37.123 --> 01:05:39.092
Jackie Bear first.

01:05:39.126 --> 01:05:40.694
And I wore
your favorite bolo tie.

01:05:40.726 --> 01:05:42.395
- Yeah.
- Okay?

01:05:42.429 --> 01:05:47.134
And... and on top of that,
I think I found something.

01:05:47.166 --> 01:05:49.702
I really did.

01:05:49.735 --> 01:05:51.737
I did! I really think I did.

01:05:51.771 --> 01:05:53.640
- I brought a camera crew even.
- Yeah, mm-hm.

01:05:53.672 --> 01:05:55.341
I brought this here
for you to look at

01:05:55.375 --> 01:05:57.411
because I think
you're gonna find it exciting.

01:05:57.443 --> 01:06:00.346
So, that's why you're here.

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:04.585
No. I mean, it's a byproduct
of why I'm here.

01:06:04.617 --> 01:06:06.619
Now...

01:06:09.322 --> 01:06:11.192
Take a look.

01:06:14.693 --> 01:06:18.599
Is it another rock
from a pet store?

01:06:18.632 --> 01:06:20.300
No.

01:06:21.867 --> 01:06:25.204
I look at this,
you sign the papers?

01:06:25.237 --> 01:06:27.373
Done.

01:06:27.407 --> 01:06:29.309
Okay.

01:06:36.215 --> 01:06:40.487
Well, it's shiny,
that's for sure.

01:06:40.519 --> 01:06:41.722
It's...

01:06:42.889 --> 01:06:45.291
It's...

01:06:52.431 --> 01:06:54.200
Um...

01:06:55.768 --> 01:06:58.371
Where did you get this?

01:06:58.405 --> 01:07:01.307
Do you think
it's Old Testament?

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:04.677
Why would you
specifically ask that?

01:07:06.579 --> 01:07:07.681
Because I think it might belong

01:07:07.713 --> 01:07:10.384
to one of the disciples
of Abaddon.

01:07:12.318 --> 01:07:15.521
I know it's crazy,
it might not even exist.

01:07:15.554 --> 01:07:18.625
But I really think
I'm on to something here.

01:07:19.992 --> 01:07:22.563
Is it possible?

01:07:24.496 --> 01:07:26.666
It is possible,

01:07:26.699 --> 01:07:30.703
but what you are chasing
might as well be Bigfoot.

01:07:30.737 --> 01:07:32.539
They don't exist.
It's the Loch Ness Monster.

01:07:32.572 --> 01:07:33.941
How did you get your hands
on something like this?

01:07:33.974 --> 01:07:36.242
Oh my gosh, you really think
I got something?

01:07:36.275 --> 01:07:40.746
I do. I... I overwhelmingly do,
but I am shocked

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:41.882
that you would have
such a thing.

01:07:41.914 --> 01:07:43.617
Yes, Tyler, you hear that?

01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:45.352
Okay, baby, number one,

01:07:45.385 --> 01:07:46.853
I will never sign
my divorce papers,

01:07:46.885 --> 01:07:48.487
absolutely not,
because I love you.

01:07:48.521 --> 01:07:50.891
I'm coming back for you
after I check this out.

01:07:50.923 --> 01:07:52.692
Mwah! Tyler, let's go!

01:07:52.726 --> 01:07:55.262
Grab my hat.

01:07:55.295 --> 01:07:57.998
Tyler...

01:08:02.268 --> 01:08:05.404
Sometimes, you go looking
for something,

01:08:05.438 --> 01:08:07.941
something your heart aches for

01:08:07.974 --> 01:08:10.978
and dreams guide us to.

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:13.279
The search could take years,

01:08:13.313 --> 01:08:16.250
all in pursuit
of this one specific thing

01:08:16.283 --> 01:08:19.453
that we feel matters
more than anything.

01:08:19.484 --> 01:08:22.587
And after all that searching
and exploring,

01:08:22.622 --> 01:08:25.359
you find something else,

01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:28.828
and that something else
is incredible,

01:08:28.862 --> 01:08:30.764
way more special than
what the original thing

01:08:30.796 --> 01:08:33.634
you were looking for was.

01:08:33.667 --> 01:08:35.702
That's what happened to me.

01:08:35.734 --> 01:08:39.438
And I was in pursuit
of something incredible,

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:43.442
a rare gemstone hidden
in an ancient Macedonian temple

01:08:43.475 --> 01:08:47.313
tucked away in a little corner
of the world.

01:08:47.345 --> 01:08:50.483
Instead, I found him.

01:08:51.885 --> 01:08:54.054
And he was special.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.988
Is...

01:08:57.023 --> 01:09:00.725
...that the tequila bottle?

01:09:35.929 --> 01:09:37.331
Babe.

01:09:38.596 --> 01:09:40.867
- Babe.
- What?

01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:41.966
I hear something.

01:09:42.001 --> 01:09:44.470
It's fucking scary.

01:09:44.502 --> 01:09:47.908
Something scary
is always happening to you.

01:10:04.556 --> 01:10:06.693
- Babe.
- I will punch you in the face.

01:10:06.725 --> 01:10:09.895
Seriously, babe,
there's something in the house.

01:11:34.881 --> 01:11:36.750
What's your spirit animal, kid?

01:11:36.783 --> 01:11:39.486
Uh...

01:11:39.519 --> 01:11:41.621
Giraffe maybe?

01:11:41.654 --> 01:11:43.156
No, wrong.

01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:44.724
Why, what do you think?

01:11:44.756 --> 01:11:46.091
You already know
what my spirit animal is?

01:11:46.125 --> 01:11:48.494
I know exactly
what your spirit animal is.

01:11:48.528 --> 01:11:50.497
- What?
- You're a doe.

01:11:50.529 --> 01:11:52.631
- A doe?
- Yeah.

01:11:52.664 --> 01:11:54.701
That's what you are.

01:11:54.734 --> 01:11:56.002
- What are you?
- You know what I am?

01:11:56.034 --> 01:11:57.604
- Yeah, what?
- I'm a hybrid.

01:11:57.636 --> 01:11:59.738
- What?
- I'm a wolf

01:11:59.771 --> 01:12:02.007
combined with a boar.

01:12:02.041 --> 01:12:04.778
That is me. Wolf boar.

01:12:09.181 --> 01:12:12.085
All right, wolf boar,

01:12:12.118 --> 01:12:14.588
what's the deal
with this last ritual?

01:12:14.621 --> 01:12:19.693
So this is the last
and most important ritual.

01:12:19.725 --> 01:12:24.130
It's the ritual where Abaddon
allegedly materializes

01:12:24.162 --> 01:12:28.200
and gives immortality
to cult members.

01:12:28.234 --> 01:12:31.605
Until they perform this
all over,

01:12:31.637 --> 01:12:34.608
legend is the cult,
including the newest member

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.844
that was just recruited,
sacrifices someone

01:12:37.877 --> 01:12:41.847
tearing apart their flesh,
and then consumed with evil,

01:12:41.881 --> 01:12:46.887
Abaddon gains the power
that keeps the spirit alive.

01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:52.057
Speaking of spirits,

01:12:52.091 --> 01:12:54.728
did you really have a bottle
stuck up your ass?

01:12:54.761 --> 01:12:57.097
Hm.

01:12:57.130 --> 01:12:58.965
Uh...

01:13:00.667 --> 01:13:03.136
- How'd that happen?
- No.

01:13:03.168 --> 01:13:05.070
No, I didn't.

01:13:05.104 --> 01:13:07.707
Why would she make that up?

01:13:10.076 --> 01:13:12.045
Look how nice it is out.

01:13:14.581 --> 01:13:15.649
- It's a beauty.
- All right,

01:13:15.681 --> 01:13:16.815
let's change the subject.

01:13:16.849 --> 01:13:19.552
Nature.

01:13:29.595 --> 01:13:31.864
Perfect place for a cult.

01:13:31.898 --> 01:13:34.100
Let's go.

01:13:34.132 --> 01:13:35.001
Hold on, Rob.

01:13:35.033 --> 01:13:37.237
Give me a sec... Rob,
give me a second.

01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:40.073
I got to fix my camera,
it's acting funny.

01:14:09.068 --> 01:14:10.704
Rob...

01:14:14.006 --> 01:14:15.074
Hold on.

01:14:15.108 --> 01:14:16.976
Really tough to walk here.

01:14:17.010 --> 01:14:20.079
Here, give me your hand.

01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:25.184
Are you rolling?

01:14:25.217 --> 01:14:26.885
I'm always rolling.

01:14:26.918 --> 01:14:29.789
How far in do you think it is?

01:14:32.725 --> 01:14:35.028
I don't know.

01:15:06.926 --> 01:15:08.361
Oh.

01:15:08.394 --> 01:15:10.096
Oh, kid.

01:15:10.128 --> 01:15:12.265
Kid, I need to borrow
your inhaler.

01:15:12.297 --> 01:15:15.068
I don't have an inhaler.

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:16.735
Really?

01:15:16.769 --> 01:15:19.905
You look like someone
who would have an inhaler.

01:15:21.774 --> 01:15:23.377
Okay.

01:15:39.725 --> 01:15:41.694
Did you hear that?

01:15:52.238 --> 01:15:55.442
Do you think
they came this way?

01:16:00.313 --> 01:16:01.881
Don't know.

01:16:01.913 --> 01:16:03.315
Maybe not.

01:16:10.155 --> 01:16:12.759
Did you hear that?

01:16:23.502 --> 01:16:25.271
You hear that?

01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:32.913
Under the bridge now.

01:16:44.356 --> 01:16:46.259
I don't think anyone's there.

01:16:46.292 --> 01:16:47.227
Get down.

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:50.063
Get back in here.

01:17:51.023 --> 01:17:53.560
We were looking for them,
but they found us.

01:17:53.592 --> 01:17:55.961
Come on, kid.

01:18:05.604 --> 01:18:10.075
Uh, Rob, what are
these creepy graves?

01:18:11.344 --> 01:18:14.847
I think it's for
the sacrificed.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.130
Is that an Abaddon footprint?

01:21:17.162 --> 01:21:19.031
No. Scarier.

01:21:19.064 --> 01:21:21.199
Mountain lion.

01:21:38.818 --> 01:21:42.255
See this? These fuckers put
their symbol on everything.

01:21:42.287 --> 01:21:43.588
We're going the right way, kid.

01:22:16.889 --> 01:22:19.192
All right, kid.

01:22:20.458 --> 01:22:23.195
Set the camera down
for a second.

01:22:25.197 --> 01:22:26.199
And take my jacket.

01:22:26.231 --> 01:22:28.333
Don't mess this up.

01:22:28.367 --> 01:22:29.601
It's my prized possession.

01:22:29.635 --> 01:22:31.369
I want an epic shot
of both of us

01:22:31.403 --> 01:22:32.805
right before we catch
this last ritual

01:22:32.837 --> 01:22:34.673
and blow this story open.

01:22:34.707 --> 01:22:36.275
You look great in that shirt,
by the way.

01:22:36.307 --> 01:22:39.479
Yeah, thanks
for getting it for me.

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.117
Yeah, I think they're
over in that direction.

01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:46.418
Kidney punch.

01:22:46.452 --> 01:22:48.521
Thanks for teaching me that,
Rob.

01:23:13.311 --> 01:23:14.846
Rob, Rob...

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:17.516
Rise and shine, buddy.

01:23:21.619 --> 01:23:24.189
Why, Tyler?

01:23:24.222 --> 01:23:27.359
I told you I'd do anything
for immortality.

01:23:27.393 --> 01:23:29.729
I wasn't joking.

01:23:31.564 --> 01:23:32.865
Don't worry.

01:23:32.898 --> 01:23:34.800
Every hundred years,

01:23:34.832 --> 01:23:38.770
I'll watch this movie we made
and think of you.

01:23:40.506 --> 01:23:42.675
Ow, pricker.

01:23:42.707 --> 01:23:44.643
Say hi to Abaddon for me.

01:23:45.978 --> 01:23:47.713
Tyler?

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.682
What?

01:23:51.984 --> 01:23:54.320
Any last words?

01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:01.761
Tell my wife I love her...

01:24:03.895 --> 01:24:07.233
...and I'm sorry about Mexico.

01:24:29.354 --> 01:24:31.990
Do I believe in that
black magic hoodoo?

01:24:32.024 --> 01:24:35.261
No, absolutely not.

01:24:35.293 --> 01:24:39.532
But when I catch them,
and I fucking will,

01:24:39.564 --> 01:24:41.567
my name will become legend.

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.003
Robert fucking Regis.

01:24:57.815 --> 01:24:59.351
Cool story, right?

01:24:59.385 --> 01:25:01.654
Crazy ending.

01:25:01.686 --> 01:25:03.622
And to think I made it all up.

01:25:03.655 --> 01:25:05.992
None of that was true.

01:25:06.024 --> 01:25:07.792
Also, you like the necklace?

01:25:07.826 --> 01:25:09.462
I do too.

01:25:09.494 --> 01:25:10.796
I stole it from this tr...

01:25:10.828 --> 01:25:14.899
I mean, bought it
from a necklace store.

01:25:14.932 --> 01:25:18.403
Anyhow, I'll see you
in the future.
