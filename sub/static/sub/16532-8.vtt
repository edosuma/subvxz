WEBVTT

00:00.305 --> 00:02.791
Ahh, breakfast lasagna!

00:02.816 --> 00:03.916
Great call, honey.

00:03.951 --> 00:05.107
Stay away from it.

00:05.132 --> 00:06.248
It's for everybody tonight.

00:06.273 --> 00:07.459
That's two meals away.

00:09.089 --> 00:10.132
Hello.

00:10.157 --> 00:12.324
Hey, Colonel, what's up?

00:12.393 --> 00:14.681
Mommy, could Ivan come for dinner?

00:14.706 --> 00:15.782
No, seÃ±or,

00:15.807 --> 00:18.651
'cause tonight the whole family
is coming over for dinner,

00:18.676 --> 00:21.912
'cause we're gonna vote on where
we're going on vacation this year.

00:21.937 --> 00:23.279
A vote with a moral stain on it,

00:23.304 --> 00:25.570
since ballots are reserved
for land-owning adults.

00:25.606 --> 00:29.034
Because nobody wants to go to
the birthplace of Edgar Allan Poe.

00:29.059 --> 00:32.182
Damn Colonel screwed me and
took his name off my petition.

00:32.207 --> 00:34.682
I'm trying to overturn this
dumb rule the club passed

00:34.707 --> 00:37.214
banning cigars within 40
feet of the main lodge.

00:37.239 --> 00:39.057
When my country passed a law

00:39.082 --> 00:41.449
that allowed them to drown 14 year olds,

00:41.474 --> 00:43.161
you said, "These things happen."

00:43.186 --> 00:46.190
I just bought a box of El
Conquistador Especiales.

00:46.215 --> 00:48.963
And they deserve to be smoked
in a fine leather chair,

00:48.988 --> 00:51.369
not out by the fountain in
some heavily-spidered area.

00:51.394 --> 00:53.037
I don't want this in my house.

00:53.062 --> 00:54.962
Can't smoke at home,
can't smoke at the club.

00:55.031 --> 00:56.697
Maybe Stella has room in her doghouse.

00:56.722 --> 00:59.066
Where is she, anyway? Haven't
seen her since the morning.

00:59.091 --> 01:00.901
I don't know where Stella is.

01:01.035 --> 01:02.432
I think it has something to do

01:02.457 --> 01:04.090
with the shock collar
that I had to put on her

01:04.114 --> 01:06.168
because she kept running away.

01:06.193 --> 01:09.487
Maybe I tell Jay that I
thought it was a necklace.

01:09.512 --> 01:11.879
He was the one who
wanted to pierce her ears.

01:12.090 --> 01:14.248
Hey sweetie, your
breakfast is on the table.

01:14.273 --> 01:15.707
Ah, what's this? Oh!

01:15.754 --> 01:17.818
Ooh, let me guess. The
guy in the cologne ad.

01:17.843 --> 01:19.320
I've named him. It's Giovanni.

01:19.345 --> 01:20.388
He's in love with me.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.722
Well, he's leaving you for me.

01:21.747 --> 01:24.225
I'm sorry. We never
meant for it to happen.

01:25.427 --> 01:27.364
- What's that?
- Toast, toast is done.

01:27.389 --> 01:29.197
Those Russian brothers who
are renting the unit upstairs,

01:29.222 --> 01:30.277
- are they...
- Gone.

01:30.302 --> 01:32.518
Because it's already been 30 days, okay?

01:32.543 --> 01:33.912
And the rules are very clear.

01:33.937 --> 01:36.214
I know all about
squatter's rights, Mitchell.

01:36.239 --> 01:37.972
Why do you always have to treat me

01:37.997 --> 01:39.559
like I'm some irresponsible...

01:39.584 --> 01:40.908
Idiot!

01:41.010 --> 01:42.643
The Russian brothers
wanted one more night.

01:42.679 --> 01:44.656
So I took cash, and I
didn't tell Mitchell,

01:44.681 --> 01:45.947
and now they won't leave.

01:46.015 --> 01:47.981
We have squatters.

01:48.184 --> 01:50.484
First termites, now squatters.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.095
At least the termites weren't my fault.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.022
Look at this beautiful side table

01:55.047 --> 01:57.068
somebody just left on the street.

01:57.093 --> 02:00.161
- Oh, do you need a hand?
- No, it's like ridiculously light.

02:01.434 --> 02:04.221
- Flapjacks for mi amore?
- Oh, grazie.

02:04.246 --> 02:05.600
Ugh. I don't know what's more syrupy...

02:05.668 --> 02:07.332
you two or Luke's chin.

02:08.104 --> 02:10.104
That's weird. I haven't
had breakfast yet.

02:10.128 --> 02:11.316
You'll have to excuse us.

02:11.341 --> 02:14.041
Your father and I watched a
very romantic movie last night.

02:14.066 --> 02:15.209
Okay, Google,

02:15.234 --> 02:18.409
play the soundtrack to
"Spaghetti for Pepe."

02:18.434 --> 02:19.190
- Playing soundtrack.
- Ooh.

02:19.215 --> 02:20.316
Mi scusa.

02:22.218 --> 02:24.277
Whoa. Watch the new kicks.

02:24.302 --> 02:26.687
What? You have another
pair of new sneakers?

02:26.723 --> 02:28.481
What is that job at the club paying you?

02:28.506 --> 02:29.557
It's the tips, Mom.

02:29.582 --> 02:32.093
There's this one lady, hold
the door for her... 10 bucks.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.293
Bring her an ice tea with
lemon, another 10 bucks.

02:34.318 --> 02:36.338
Best tips I ever made
was when we passed the hat

02:36.363 --> 02:39.112
after a performance of my
improv group, "Rule of Three."

02:39.137 --> 02:41.302
We were known for our
sketches, song parodies,

02:41.327 --> 02:42.680
and full-frontal nudity.

02:42.705 --> 02:44.612
Uhp.

02:44.637 --> 02:45.673
Hello?

02:45.742 --> 02:47.485
You are all out of orange juice.

02:47.510 --> 02:49.137
I understand.

02:49.356 --> 02:51.581
I have to go out for orange juice.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.457
Yes, I understand.

02:53.482 --> 02:55.950
I have to go out for orange juice.

02:55.975 --> 02:57.231
Mitchell?

02:57.256 --> 02:59.256
I have to go out for orange juice.

03:10.597 --> 03:14.410
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

03:15.004 --> 03:16.504
Thank you for coming.

03:16.559 --> 03:18.744
I have a problem with Russians.

03:18.769 --> 03:20.335
Being married to a Pritchett is great.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.160
- So great!
- The best!

03:22.185 --> 03:24.373
But they can be a... a tad judgmental.

03:24.398 --> 03:26.352
- Almost punitive.
- They are monsters.

03:26.377 --> 03:29.045
That's why the three of us
formed a... a secret alliance

03:29.070 --> 03:31.692
to help each other cover up
our... our little mistakes.

03:31.717 --> 03:33.668
Like back in December,
when I hastily purchased

03:33.693 --> 03:36.082
an expensive prop for an open house.

03:36.426 --> 03:37.766
Thanks so much for hiding it.

03:37.791 --> 03:38.823
Claire would kill me.

03:38.848 --> 03:40.551
And it's only till Monday,
when I can return it.

03:40.576 --> 03:41.832
Don't worry.

03:41.857 --> 03:43.535
Ay, Ay!

03:45.801 --> 03:47.596
Hi!

03:47.621 --> 03:50.809
Oh, welcome home!

03:50.841 --> 03:53.285
- You're so early, right?
- Not really.

03:53.310 --> 03:56.649
There is that smile that I love.

03:56.674 --> 03:58.874
- Why don't you take me to lunch?
- Okay.

03:58.899 --> 04:00.019
What happened here, anyway?

04:00.044 --> 04:01.902
You get into Joe's
scented markers again?

04:03.832 --> 04:07.402
So now, I have scary Russian
squatters who won't leave.

04:07.793 --> 04:09.995
We'll have a small window
when Mitchell goes to the gym.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.049
He usually stretches,

04:11.074 --> 04:12.262
takes a lap around the locker room,

04:12.287 --> 04:13.300
and then gets a smoothie.

04:13.325 --> 04:15.590
You two deal with the Russians,
and I'll keep Mitch distracted.

04:15.615 --> 04:17.120
- Anything else?
- Yes.

04:17.144 --> 04:18.252
Our gate is broken,

04:18.277 --> 04:20.572
and Stella keeps getting
out in the street.

04:20.598 --> 04:22.112
I bought her a shock collar.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.909
I thought about getting
one when Luke was younger.

04:23.934 --> 04:25.987
Claire ended up just shaking
a can of pennies at him.

04:26.012 --> 04:27.606
It spooked her and she's hiding.

04:27.631 --> 04:30.612
We need to find her before
Jay does and sees the collar.

04:30.637 --> 04:33.502
He has warned me many times not
to get one because they are cruel.

04:33.527 --> 04:35.487
All right, we'll deal
with the Russians first,

04:35.512 --> 04:37.268
then come find Stella
before the big vote.

04:37.293 --> 04:39.660
We do not have much time. We need to go.

04:40.395 --> 04:42.662
I actually ordered a sandwich.

04:45.759 --> 04:48.016
- Is Rainer not here yet?
- Oh no, he is.

04:48.041 --> 04:50.432
He, uh, signed a head
shot I didn't ask for,

04:50.457 --> 04:52.035
and then went to the bathroom.

04:52.060 --> 04:53.301
There's his daughter.

04:54.973 --> 04:56.745
I've never met a
boyfriend's daughter before.

04:56.770 --> 04:58.206
I mean, I went out with Stacy's dad,

04:58.231 --> 04:59.761
but I've known her
since, like, kindergarten.

04:59.786 --> 05:01.820
You're nervous? I mean,
how could this go wrong?

05:01.845 --> 05:03.323
She's a teenage girl.
That's when you peaked.

05:03.348 --> 05:04.424
I know.

05:04.449 --> 05:05.596
I guess I just really like this guy,

05:05.621 --> 05:06.846
and I want to be able to show him

05:06.871 --> 05:08.947
I can fit into the more
complicated parts of his life.

05:08.972 --> 05:10.038
Hey, princess.

05:10.063 --> 05:11.371
- Hey!
- Hey!

05:11.396 --> 05:13.665
Six people filmed me
arguing with that meter maid,

05:13.690 --> 05:15.300
and no one caught this adorable moment?

05:15.369 --> 05:16.926
Mwah.

05:17.639 --> 05:20.196
- So, you must be April.
- Uh, yeah?

05:20.265 --> 05:22.165
April, tone.

05:22.190 --> 05:23.310
I'll grab a chair.

05:25.170 --> 05:27.426
Sorry. That's work. Gotta take that.

05:28.140 --> 05:30.183
Anyways, I'm Haley, your dad's, uh...

05:30.208 --> 05:31.683
- Latest?
- Yes!

05:31.752 --> 05:33.769
Flash flood in the Mohave,
they need me to cover.

05:33.794 --> 05:36.346
The water's already ramp
high at the senior center.

05:36.415 --> 05:38.035
You know, a puppy
floats by on a pizza box,

05:38.060 --> 05:39.301
this could be national.

05:39.326 --> 05:41.096
Oops, snakes. Our day!

05:41.121 --> 05:42.440
I'll just go to Mom and Jeff's.

05:42.465 --> 05:44.596
No, no, we were supposed to
get to know each other today.

05:44.621 --> 05:46.440
Um, I can watch you.

05:46.465 --> 05:48.379
- Because I'm 4?
- Oh, tone.

05:48.404 --> 05:49.423
Are you sure?

05:49.448 --> 05:51.013
Yes. Girls day. We'll meet you later.

05:51.038 --> 05:53.621
Oh, okay, thank you for
understanding, sweetie.

05:53.646 --> 05:55.040
- No problem.
- No problem.

05:56.366 --> 05:57.586
Tragedy strikes.

05:57.611 --> 05:59.077
Dozens dead.

05:59.102 --> 06:00.116
Tragedy strikes.

06:00.141 --> 06:01.472
Dozens dead.

06:02.410 --> 06:04.783
And our final order of
business is our entry

06:04.808 --> 06:07.506
to this year's Expo
Internacional du Closet.

06:07.531 --> 06:09.854
- What do we got?
- Okay, so we all know

06:09.879 --> 06:12.257
that Europeans prefer
strong but simple lines...

06:12.282 --> 06:13.402
- Mm-hmm.
- ... which is why I think

06:13.427 --> 06:15.193
that we should go with the Trafalgar.

06:15.262 --> 06:17.308
Interesting.

06:17.564 --> 06:18.907
It's sturdy, dependable.

06:18.955 --> 06:21.752
On the other hand, the Matterhorn
is a chance to shake things up.

06:21.777 --> 06:23.627
Think about what the Danes did in '02.

06:23.652 --> 06:25.470
Also valid.

06:25.762 --> 06:27.238
It's bold, innovative.

06:28.875 --> 06:30.442
Ah, gotta take this.

06:30.467 --> 06:32.838
Civil rights issue over at
the club I have to deal with.

06:32.863 --> 06:34.746
- Hello.
- What's so funny?

06:34.771 --> 06:36.549
- What are you laughing at?
- It's so cute...

06:36.574 --> 06:38.583
how nervous you are
about your first expo.

06:38.652 --> 06:39.894
It's like every time
we throw out an idea,

06:39.919 --> 06:42.220
you have to look to see
what your dad is thinking.

06:42.245 --> 06:43.440
I don't do that.

06:43.465 --> 06:44.877
I-I-I don't do that at all, Dom.

06:44.902 --> 06:46.408
Maybe you do that with your dad. So...

06:46.433 --> 06:48.902
Gary won't sign my
petition unless I sign his.

06:48.927 --> 06:50.005
It'll be a cold day in hell

06:50.030 --> 06:52.676
before that hippie
tees off in flip-flops.

06:53.443 --> 06:54.843
Where were we?

06:54.868 --> 06:56.835
I was just about to make my decision

06:56.860 --> 07:01.406
between the Trafalgar
and the Matterhorn.

07:01.461 --> 07:02.794
Mm-hmm.

07:02.819 --> 07:05.211
I got the power suit, the corner office.

07:05.278 --> 07:07.045
A closet doesn't get
installed in this town

07:07.080 --> 07:08.413
without me knowing about it.

07:08.438 --> 07:10.869
But one important
decision, and suddenly...

07:10.894 --> 07:13.061
I'm this pig-tailed
little girl in Mary Janes

07:13.086 --> 07:16.096
looking to Daddy to tell me I'm smart.

07:16.121 --> 07:19.401
Uh... it's too important a
decision to make right now.

07:19.426 --> 07:21.457
I'm just gonna take the rest
of the day to think about it.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.362
Okay, but Munich needs to know by 5:00.

07:23.387 --> 07:26.664
I know, but this is a tough choice.

07:26.689 --> 07:28.051
Is it?

07:30.931 --> 07:32.475
Hey, I brought your clothes for tonight.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.281
Oh, thank you honey, that's so sweet.

07:34.306 --> 07:36.335
- How's it going with, um...
- The wi-fi won't work,

07:36.360 --> 07:38.453
and this whole place
smells like Cup O' Noodles.

07:38.478 --> 07:40.742
Mom, this is April, Rainer's daughter.

07:40.767 --> 07:42.414
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hi.

07:42.439 --> 07:44.046
So, I'm gonna look for a ladies' room.

07:44.071 --> 07:45.369
Do they have those in factories?

07:45.438 --> 07:47.438
Uh, we do, yes. It's just down the hall.

07:47.463 --> 07:49.241
- Just down the hall.
- Thanks, echo.

07:52.745 --> 07:53.788
What's so funny?

07:53.813 --> 07:56.453
Oh, just you dealing
with a teenage girl.

07:56.478 --> 07:57.993
Not as easy as it looks, is it?

07:58.018 --> 07:59.894
Excuse me. I'm doing just fine.

07:59.919 --> 08:01.252
Hey, kiddo.

08:01.277 --> 08:03.331
We gonna see you tonight
for the big vacation vote?

08:03.356 --> 08:05.967
You bet. Mind if I bring
an unbearable teenager?

08:05.992 --> 08:07.078
What's one more.

08:07.103 --> 08:08.960
Listen, I'm gonna run over to the club

08:08.985 --> 08:10.208
and scare up one last signature

08:10.233 --> 08:11.571
- for my cigar petition.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

08:11.596 --> 08:14.465
Oh, have you decided on
what closet for the expo?

08:14.534 --> 08:16.946
- 'Cause I was thinking...
- No! No, no, no. No, thank you.

08:16.971 --> 08:19.770
I will let you know when
I have made my decision.

08:19.795 --> 08:21.839
Sure. Sandwich looks good.

08:21.875 --> 08:22.946
Does it? Does it look good to you?

08:22.971 --> 08:24.517
'Cause that doesn't mean
it's a good sandwich.

08:24.542 --> 08:26.576
It's not. As a matter of
fact, it's not a good sandwich.

08:26.601 --> 08:28.007
All right!

08:28.032 --> 08:29.658
- See you guys later tonight.
- Uh-huh.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.313
- Just do it.
- Okay.

08:36.256 --> 08:37.587
Luke?

08:37.690 --> 08:39.157
Buddy?

08:40.485 --> 08:43.628
Kevin, was that my grandson
taking off in that sportscar?

08:43.696 --> 08:44.869
Yeah, it was.

08:44.894 --> 08:46.898
That's quite a spin on that
response. What's going on?

08:46.966 --> 08:49.267
Maggie Braithwait has some work
for him to do around her house.

08:49.292 --> 08:50.439
She's got an eye for the young ones.

08:50.464 --> 08:51.501
Should I be worried?

08:51.530 --> 08:52.970
She might try and pressure
him a little, but...

08:52.995 --> 08:54.493
Luke's a smart kid, right?

08:56.643 --> 08:57.875
Damn it.

08:58.567 --> 08:59.888
Oh, thank God you're here.

08:59.913 --> 09:01.890
I can hear the Russians
upstairs laughing at democracy.

09:01.915 --> 09:04.415
- All right, shall we?
- No. I work alone.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.617
If you hear two bodies
hit the floor, it's done.

09:06.686 --> 09:09.183
If you hear three, one
tried to get back up.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.607
Okay...

09:11.524 --> 09:13.544
Oh! I'm so sorry!

09:13.569 --> 09:14.630
Phil!

09:14.655 --> 09:16.627
Oh, Mitchell!

09:16.696 --> 09:18.840
Wow, that's crazy.
Is... is this your gym?

09:18.865 --> 09:19.897
- Yeah.
- Oh.

09:19.922 --> 09:21.309
I was just heading into the post office.

09:21.334 --> 09:22.977
You mind keeping me company?
They're always quick.

09:23.002 --> 09:24.602
Oh, well, actually, I gotta...

09:24.704 --> 09:25.958
I don't have my keys.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.305
Oh, I must have dropped them.

09:27.330 --> 09:29.040
Oh, no. Well, I'll... I'll
help you check the gym.

09:29.065 --> 09:31.263
You remember what
machines you were using?

09:32.245 --> 09:33.578
All of them.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.661
We scoured that gym.

09:37.142 --> 09:39.052
It actually did take a crazy long time,

09:39.077 --> 09:40.985
because Mitchell kept getting lost.

09:41.087 --> 09:43.120
But I still needed a little more time.

09:43.189 --> 09:45.793
Ugh, sorry that took so long.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.326
I can't pass up a library book sale.

09:48.361 --> 09:50.061
I mean, a dollar for as many magazines

09:50.086 --> 09:51.395
as you can fit in the car.

09:51.420 --> 09:53.731
Yeah, National Geo...

09:53.800 --> 09:55.600
Land of Savages.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.130
How old are these?

09:57.155 --> 09:58.193
Hi, honey.

09:58.218 --> 10:00.880
Hey, Phil, I know you already went
to the store for O.J. this morning,

10:00.905 --> 10:02.417
but can you go back and
grab some wine for tonight?

10:02.442 --> 10:03.574
You got it.

10:03.676 --> 10:04.842
Ciao, bella.

10:04.911 --> 10:06.611
You went out for orange
juice this morning?

10:06.713 --> 10:08.746
That's a coincidence. Cam did too.

10:08.771 --> 10:10.725
That is a coincidence.
That's... that's really...

10:13.092 --> 10:14.092
_

10:14.349 --> 10:15.482
_

10:15.788 --> 10:18.489
Every day, I take Joe to a
park in a Russian neighborhood.

10:18.514 --> 10:19.601
We like it there.

10:19.636 --> 10:21.161
I have picked up a few phrases

10:21.186 --> 10:23.828
that the Russian nannies
tell to the Russian kids.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.052
_

10:26.077 --> 10:27.077
_

10:27.099 --> 10:29.232
_

10:30.209 --> 10:31.997
_

10:32.178 --> 10:36.357
_

10:36.888 --> 10:39.185
_

10:40.193 --> 10:41.974
_

10:42.138 --> 10:44.779
_

10:45.381 --> 10:47.380
_

10:49.029 --> 10:51.200
_

10:51.599 --> 10:53.257
Well, it's pretty simple, Mitch.

10:53.282 --> 10:54.365
You just touch everything,

10:54.390 --> 10:55.902
and then when the tow truck guy shows up

10:55.927 --> 10:57.038
and sees your dirty paws,

10:57.063 --> 10:58.229
he knows you're a pro.

10:58.297 --> 11:00.880
Also, say "fan belt" as often as you...

11:00.905 --> 11:02.299
Mitchell?

11:02.368 --> 11:03.935
Mitchell?

11:05.015 --> 11:06.804
- Hello.
- The red panda's left the zoo.

11:06.873 --> 11:08.949
- Red panda?
- Mitchell's code name!

11:08.974 --> 11:11.252
I stalled him for as long
as I could, and he got away.

11:11.300 --> 11:13.560
Okay, well, how much time do I have?

11:13.593 --> 11:15.220
I'm not sure. I don't
really know where I am.

11:15.245 --> 11:16.247
All I can see is...

11:16.272 --> 11:18.138
- Oh, there's your house.
- What?

11:18.427 --> 11:19.941
- Cam.
- Hi, sweetheart!

11:20.019 --> 11:21.691
Save the Southern charm, Scarlett.

11:21.716 --> 11:22.763
Phil was clearly...

11:22.788 --> 11:24.098
- just trying to keep me from here.
- What?

11:24.123 --> 11:25.133
Yeah, I-I lost my keys,

11:25.158 --> 11:27.318
and sudden... suddenly
he shows up and...

11:27.627 --> 11:29.827
Does this have something to do
with the thud we heard upstairs?

11:29.852 --> 11:31.339
Mitchell, I... I say this with love,

11:31.364 --> 11:33.191
but you're coming unhinged.

11:33.216 --> 11:34.765
The suspicions, the accusations,

11:34.834 --> 11:37.113
the mechanical sexual performance...

11:37.138 --> 11:38.736
Where has Mitchell gone?

11:38.805 --> 11:40.037
Yeah, I'm... but I'm not a doctor,

11:40.073 --> 11:41.388
so if you think something's
going on upstairs,

11:41.413 --> 11:42.907
by all means, let's go take a look.

11:42.975 --> 11:44.075
You know, on the other hand,

11:44.100 --> 11:45.967
if I were a doctor,

11:46.154 --> 11:47.445
I would say,

11:47.480 --> 11:49.747
"What's up with all the
conspiracy theories?"

11:49.849 --> 11:52.116
It's textbook paranoia.

11:52.185 --> 11:53.966
Everyone's talking about it.

11:53.991 --> 11:56.554
But again, not a doctor, so shall we?

11:59.079 --> 12:00.112
Huh.

12:00.137 --> 12:03.461
Well, you know, there are 30 different
ways to say "I'm sorry" in Russian.

12:03.486 --> 12:04.593
I'm sorry.

12:04.618 --> 12:06.564
Maybe I was being paranoid.

12:06.589 --> 12:07.677
Apology accepted,

12:07.702 --> 12:10.534
and I'm sorry for calling
your lovemaking mechanical.

12:10.570 --> 12:12.777
I actually really like your
shy, school teacher character.

12:19.512 --> 12:21.946
El Conquistador Especial.

12:21.971 --> 12:23.380
My dad's brand.

12:23.416 --> 12:25.382
That doesn't explain
the lipstick, though.

12:25.418 --> 12:27.718
No, my dad won't even wear Chapstick.

12:27.787 --> 12:29.688
He says it's a gateway balm.

12:32.922 --> 12:33.935
- Grandpa?
- Oh, geez.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.413
I knew I should have run that yellow.

12:35.438 --> 12:36.494
Where's your shirt?

12:36.529 --> 12:38.496
Mrs. Braithwait wanted
me to move some boxes,

12:38.521 --> 12:40.698
and told me to take it
off so it didn't get dirty.

12:40.767 --> 12:42.566
But I kinda feel dirty anyway.

12:42.602 --> 12:44.368
Grab your shirt. We're leaving.

12:44.504 --> 12:48.344
Luke, let's get those dirty,
tight pants in the wash.

12:48.508 --> 12:49.640
Oh, hello.

12:49.742 --> 12:52.610
How are ya? I'm here to pick
up my barely-legal grandson.

12:52.635 --> 12:53.913
I recognize you.

12:53.945 --> 12:55.571
From the club, right? You're the one...

12:55.596 --> 12:57.741
fighting that silly new cigar rule.

12:57.984 --> 12:59.641
Excuse me? Where'd you put my shirt?

12:59.666 --> 13:01.863
Give us a minute, kid. It
is a dumb rule, isn't it.

13:01.888 --> 13:03.203
It's terrible.

13:03.228 --> 13:05.823
My late husband loved
smoking in the main lodge.

13:05.858 --> 13:07.445
Is that whose cologne
you made me put on?

13:07.470 --> 13:09.026
Hey, hey, hey. Boxes, right?

13:09.128 --> 13:10.600
I've got a petition here.

13:10.625 --> 13:12.496
Why don't you read it quick?
You might want to sign it.

13:12.565 --> 13:14.702
Oh, I'm not sure now's such a good time.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.544
My neck is so...

13:16.569 --> 13:17.645
Luke, get in there.

13:17.670 --> 13:19.727
Put your magic fingers to work.

13:23.429 --> 13:26.531
Mm. How do you know my body this well?

13:26.556 --> 13:28.112
Right there on the "X."

13:28.214 --> 13:29.380
Ooh...

13:29.448 --> 13:31.816
Oh, you seem relaxed. I should stop.

13:31.841 --> 13:33.450
Not just yet.

13:33.553 --> 13:36.153
If it would be easier,
just hold the pen,

13:36.189 --> 13:38.709
and I will move the paper underneath.

13:38.734 --> 13:41.491
If I'd have known you were this
good, I would have had you do my feet.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.717
He's gonna get there.
He's working his way down.

13:43.742 --> 13:44.763
Ahh.

13:44.788 --> 13:46.797
Probably just your
initials would be okay.

13:46.976 --> 13:48.109
You know what?

13:48.134 --> 13:49.944
If you don't mind, I'm
gonna sign this later,

13:49.969 --> 13:51.068
send it home with Luke.

13:51.137 --> 13:52.336
All right, come on.

13:52.361 --> 13:53.393
We're done.

13:54.774 --> 13:57.289
Okay, but, uh...

13:57.816 --> 13:59.282
you're definitely gonna sign it, right?

13:59.307 --> 14:00.688
Definitely, promise.

14:00.713 --> 14:01.756
Bye-bye.

14:01.781 --> 14:03.024
Luke, we should probably get upstairs

14:03.049 --> 14:04.883
and flip that mattress.

14:06.336 --> 14:07.395
Luke, I'm sorry.

14:07.420 --> 14:09.831
I forgot your mom needs you
home for your piano lesson.

14:09.856 --> 14:12.089
- Let's go.
- Gotta run. See ya.

14:12.235 --> 14:13.301
Took you long enough.

14:13.326 --> 14:14.859
Oh, please, it was an extra 10 seconds.

14:14.884 --> 14:16.186
What could have happened?

14:16.288 --> 14:18.539
She asked me to do push-ups while
she put on her wedding dress.

14:18.564 --> 14:20.788
Wow, she jumped right to
the Honeymoon Handshake.

14:20.813 --> 14:21.876
It has a name?

14:21.901 --> 14:24.406
Don't you and your dad ever talk?

14:25.456 --> 14:27.089
Okay, we've searched
everywhere for Stella.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.263
- No sign.
- Yet.

14:28.288 --> 14:30.274
Don't worry, we'll find her
before the gray goat does.

14:30.299 --> 14:31.659
- Who?
- Jay.

14:31.684 --> 14:32.794
Come on, guys,

14:32.819 --> 14:34.568
I spend a lot of time
on those code names.

14:34.637 --> 14:36.914
Okay, hurry, because he
takes a picture of her

14:36.939 --> 14:38.383
every day at the same time

14:38.408 --> 14:40.145
because he's making a flip book.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.777
Ay, watch out, watch out. I
think Mitchell is looking at us.

14:42.845 --> 14:44.137
Okay, I thought I cooled
his suspicions this morning.

14:44.162 --> 14:45.189
Laugh and disperse.

14:46.349 --> 14:48.516
Ay!

14:49.619 --> 14:51.285
- Hey, mom. Red wine?
- Oh, thanks.

14:51.387 --> 14:52.820
- Grandpa said you'd like it.
- Really?

14:52.889 --> 14:54.155
Well, who cares what he thinks?

14:54.190 --> 14:56.657
Just 'cause he likes something,
I'm supposed to like it? Unreal.

14:56.682 --> 14:58.237
Mm, and of course, it's gross.

14:58.262 --> 14:59.481
Okay, well, I'll just take it back then.

14:59.506 --> 15:01.262
No, no! No need to make
a big deal out of things.

15:01.287 --> 15:02.673
I'll just drink it.

15:02.698 --> 15:04.498
Hey! Any word from your dad?

15:04.567 --> 15:06.268
He texted me, like, two hours ago.

15:06.293 --> 15:07.934
I told him how you kept the
car running when you got gas

15:07.959 --> 15:09.013
and could've blown me up.

15:09.038 --> 15:11.253
But you told him about
the fun things too right?

15:11.278 --> 15:12.339
We had that huge cookie,

15:12.375 --> 15:14.575
you spun away from me fast
and got your hair in my mouth.

15:15.646 --> 15:16.844
What was that for?

15:16.913 --> 15:19.552
My friend Betsy has an
Insta about sad stuff.

15:19.577 --> 15:21.243
Uh-huh...

15:27.356 --> 15:29.356
- Oh, I-I wasn't...
- No, it's okay. I don't judge.

15:29.425 --> 15:31.158
- I'm wearing a clear coat on my nails.
- Ah.

15:31.227 --> 15:33.160
Yeah, I know, what a chowder head.

15:33.196 --> 15:35.004
Hey, speaking of that
regional delicacy...

15:35.029 --> 15:36.729
I am not voting to go to Boston

15:36.754 --> 15:39.867
just so we could see where America's
first ghoul was potty trained.

15:39.936 --> 15:41.435
Care to wipe the lipstick off my neck

15:41.460 --> 15:43.418
from where you bit my head off?

15:43.465 --> 15:45.323
Hey... And why is there no orange juice?

15:45.348 --> 15:46.980
My mom went out for some this morning.

15:47.005 --> 15:48.041
Really?

15:48.066 --> 15:49.343
That you find interesting?

15:49.445 --> 15:52.012
Might as well pack
for SeaWorld right now.

15:52.895 --> 15:54.515
Hey, guys, have you seen April?

15:54.550 --> 15:55.560
Just saw her a minute ago.

15:55.585 --> 15:57.985
She had me pose for some
Instagram thing her friend does.

15:59.889 --> 16:01.265
What is this?

16:01.290 --> 16:02.645
Clothes that don't come from a mall.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.658
Hold on, hold on. I'm
supposed to be watching you.

16:04.683 --> 16:06.504
I'm going to Betsy's.
My Uber's out front.

16:06.529 --> 16:08.528
Who is this Betsy? Are
her parents even home?

16:08.553 --> 16:10.698
And you're 14. You're
not Ubering anywhere.

16:10.766 --> 16:12.299
Also, you... you can lose the makeup

16:12.368 --> 16:13.834
because you look like a prostitute

16:13.870 --> 16:15.082
at an electronics convention.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.590
Now, go wipe it off
and help set the table.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.176
Huh.

16:22.395 --> 16:24.879
What? I'm... I'm not used
to being all parenty, okay?

16:24.904 --> 16:26.313
No, you did a great job.

16:26.382 --> 16:28.015
Oh, thanks.

16:28.084 --> 16:29.917
I just felt weird 'cause you
were standing right there,

16:29.942 --> 16:30.985
and you're, like, the expert.

16:31.020 --> 16:32.853
Oh, I am hardly the expert.

16:32.922 --> 16:34.054
I still...

16:34.079 --> 16:37.082
I still have my own
stuff to work on. Hm.

16:37.107 --> 16:38.970
Maybe I shouldn't have
called her a prostitute?

16:38.995 --> 16:40.828
You gotta have fun with it. Hm.

16:43.466 --> 16:44.809
Hey, Dad.

16:45.434 --> 16:48.068
I'm sorry that I barked at you today.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.448
It's just with this
whole Expo decision...

16:51.774 --> 16:55.300
I hate feeling like a little
girl that needs her daddy's help.

16:55.325 --> 16:58.722
But I guess there's no
harm in looking to the guy

16:58.747 --> 17:01.225
who's been knocking it out of
the park for 25 years, right?

17:01.250 --> 17:02.465
Nope.

17:02.490 --> 17:06.253
And the best advice that guy could
give you is, go with you gut...

17:06.723 --> 17:08.387
'cause you're good at this.

17:08.589 --> 17:10.324
Thanks. Thanks.

17:10.348 --> 17:12.127
And I... and I have made a decision.

17:12.228 --> 17:15.411
I'm going with the Matterhorn.

17:15.897 --> 17:17.064
Huh.

17:18.133 --> 17:19.733
Damn it.

17:20.411 --> 17:22.469
Look who I found!

17:22.493 --> 17:23.512
Thank God!

17:23.537 --> 17:25.262
This is the first time
I'm so happy to see her.

17:25.287 --> 17:26.768
Let's get this shock
collar off, before he...

17:26.792 --> 17:28.275
Hello, guys!

17:28.344 --> 17:29.893
- There's my little baby.
- Ah!

17:29.918 --> 17:31.145
You two, take these in the house.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.051
I've got a couple left in the
trunk. A little help, buddy.

17:33.076 --> 17:34.940
- Oh, on the other side of the gate?
- Come on, Phil!

17:34.984 --> 17:37.090
Couldn't they just circle back around?

17:41.426 --> 17:42.890
- Say what?
- It's nothing.

17:42.959 --> 17:44.325
All right, take that.

17:48.512 --> 17:50.212
Oh, mama!

17:56.839 --> 17:58.238
What's wrong with you? Pick it up.

17:58.307 --> 17:59.940
Yeah, let's do it. Let's pick it up.

18:00.042 --> 18:01.118
Aah! Aah!

18:02.244 --> 18:03.338
What the hell's the matter with you?

18:03.363 --> 18:04.599
Why are you making those sounds?

18:04.624 --> 18:06.113
I don't think that's... Mm.

18:07.465 --> 18:09.650
All right, when you're done here,
come back 'cause there's more.

18:09.719 --> 18:11.067
Okie-doke.

18:13.422 --> 18:14.655
What the hell is that?

18:14.757 --> 18:16.020
Is that a shock collar?

18:16.045 --> 18:18.336
I don't know, but this is a shocked face

18:18.361 --> 18:21.305
because I have never seen
something like that in my life.

18:21.330 --> 18:22.663
So you obviously bought it.

18:22.698 --> 18:24.996
I just didn't want Stella
to walk out in the street.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.577
That's what a leash is for!

18:26.602 --> 18:28.602
You're a bad dog owner. Bad dog owner!

18:28.704 --> 18:30.911
- Why did you have it?
- Well, I know why.

18:30.936 --> 18:32.706
Yeah, because they're
all working together.

18:32.731 --> 18:33.971
Oh, here we go.

18:33.996 --> 18:35.342
You should've heard his
paranoia this morning

18:35.367 --> 18:37.292
about the... the Russian renters?

18:37.317 --> 18:38.971
Oh, I'm glad... I'm glad
you brought up the Russians

18:38.996 --> 18:40.565
because look at what I found!

18:40.667 --> 18:42.426
That's my El Conquistador Especial.

18:42.451 --> 18:43.884
Gloria took that from me this morning.

18:43.919 --> 18:44.985
Oh, let me guess,

18:45.010 --> 18:47.054
right before she went
out to buy orange juice...

18:47.089 --> 18:48.714
- That's right...
- Except for she wasn't.

18:48.739 --> 18:51.158
She was with Cam getting
rid of the squatters

18:51.227 --> 18:54.090
while I was being stalled by that man!

18:54.764 --> 18:56.240
They helped me hide a reindeer!

18:56.265 --> 18:57.464
From a year ago?

18:57.500 --> 18:59.099
Who knows how long
this has been going on.

18:59.168 --> 19:00.401
Okay, they've been in cahoots,

19:00.469 --> 19:01.835
covering up each other's mistakes

19:01.904 --> 19:03.837
before we've even had
a chance to shame them.

19:03.906 --> 19:05.806
Since this little alliance

19:05.841 --> 19:07.508
made a decision to go behind our backs,

19:07.533 --> 19:09.476
maybe we should make a
decision without them...

19:09.578 --> 19:11.793
- Oh...
- Like where we're going on vacation.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.121
- What?
- No, por favor, no!

19:13.146 --> 19:14.151
What? No!

19:14.176 --> 19:15.176
- You can't do that.
- I like it. I like it.

19:15.201 --> 19:16.398
Let's do this. Let's go vote.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.453
Yep. We've got it.

19:19.522 --> 19:20.988
Okay. We've reached a decision.

19:21.013 --> 19:22.356
Drum roll please.

19:24.293 --> 19:25.801
Close enough.

19:26.195 --> 19:28.286
The family is going to...

19:29.189 --> 19:31.254
- Italy!
- Ah! Yes!

19:31.279 --> 19:32.800
- Oh, no!
- That's awesome!

19:32.868 --> 19:35.302
That's so awesome, guys!

19:35.371 --> 19:38.472
The cutest part is that
they think it was their idea.

19:45.347 --> 19:46.590
Mmm, what are you making?

19:46.615 --> 19:48.059
I'm making an Italian dish

19:48.084 --> 19:49.750
that Jay's mother used to make.

19:51.487 --> 19:52.853
Breakfast lasagna.

19:52.955 --> 19:54.154
Great call, honey.

19:58.809 --> 19:59.875
- Hi.
- Oh.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.528
Hey, sweetie, your
breakfast is on the table.

20:01.630 --> 20:03.183
Oh, what's this? Oh!

20:03.208 --> 20:05.190
I've named him. It's Giovanni.

20:05.598 --> 20:08.045
I'm still thinking about
that movie last night.

20:08.070 --> 20:09.503
You picked a good one.

20:09.528 --> 20:12.383
Only the Italians could
make something that romantic.

20:12.408 --> 20:14.074
Flapjacks for mi amore.

20:14.176 --> 20:15.342
Oh, grazie.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.767
No offense, Dad, but I'm
not sure these magazines

20:19.792 --> 20:21.861
are the treasure trove of
information you thought they were.

20:21.886 --> 20:23.247
What are you talking about?

20:23.279 --> 20:25.302
Glaciers: Now and Forever.

20:25.327 --> 20:27.398
Canada: Our mysterious
Neighbor to the North.

20:27.423 --> 20:29.639
Don't hate these photos
of the lost tribes.

20:29.810 --> 20:31.609
That's a human head
hanging off her skirt.

20:31.641 --> 20:33.781
Kids, these magazines
harken back to a time

20:33.806 --> 20:35.876
when man had to forage
and fight for his foods.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.338
You guys have it too easy nowadays.

20:37.363 --> 20:38.705
You can lay around eating snacks saying,

20:38.730 --> 20:40.697
"Okay, Google, dim the kitchen lights."

20:40.722 --> 20:41.971
Sure thing.

20:43.377 --> 20:45.337
Go ahead, Dad.

20:45.362 --> 20:47.295
Okay, Google,

20:47.320 --> 20:49.548
show me a video of a kangaroo

20:49.573 --> 20:52.900
playing badminton with a pirate.

20:52.925 --> 20:54.425
Sure, playing on YouTube.

20:54.450 --> 20:56.784
What?!
