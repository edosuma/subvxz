WEBVTT

00:05.812 --> 00:07.944
_

00:11.212 --> 00:13.214
Hey, Joan, you want to
go for a walk with me?

00:13.247 --> 00:14.782
I got my new stretchy pants on.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.425
Oh, I think the ones

00:16.450 --> 00:19.587
with the little windows in
the front are for the ladies.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.922
Oh, man.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.192
I can't return 'em 'cause
I'm not wearing underwear.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.535
All right, what do you say...

00:25.559 --> 00:27.657
let's take this awesome
conversation on the road,

00:27.682 --> 00:29.463
put a few miles on that new knee.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.309
Oh, fun. No.

00:31.334 --> 00:33.434
Oh, come on, Joan, we
both need the rehab.

00:33.459 --> 00:34.868
My ticker, your kicker.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.003
Besides, I promised
Heather that I'd get you

00:37.028 --> 00:38.339
out of that bathrobe.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.315
I don't think that
was correctly phrased.

00:41.340 --> 00:43.043
No, that's exactly what I wanted to say.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.698
Um, I want to get you out of that robe

00:44.723 --> 00:46.392
and turn you into a streetwalker.

00:50.035 --> 00:51.293
Oh, I'm exhausted.

00:51.326 --> 00:54.596
These pants have no ventilation.

00:54.629 --> 00:57.332
My thigh windows are all fogged up.

00:57.365 --> 00:59.106
Yeah, I feel the same.

00:59.131 --> 01:01.620
I couldn't even walk
over the speed bump.

01:01.645 --> 01:05.354
I had to sit on the curb
and then throw my legs over.

01:05.379 --> 01:07.253
Whoa, look at this.

01:07.278 --> 01:08.943
Who would throw this out?

01:08.977 --> 01:11.213
Oh, I think most people.

01:11.246 --> 01:13.298
Yeah, well, most people don't have

01:13.323 --> 01:16.426
a treadmill-sized space
right next to their bed.

01:16.460 --> 01:19.129
Well, I haven't played one of these

01:19.163 --> 01:21.298
since John and I were first dating.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.333
Oh, my gosh, we won enough tickets

01:23.367 --> 01:25.969
to buy three packs of cigarettes.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.471
It was a different time.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.804
I can't even remember
the first time I played.

01:29.829 --> 01:32.309
So, we've all got our stories.

01:35.679 --> 01:38.148
Yeah, and now I'm just
like this old table:

01:38.182 --> 01:41.017
I'm broken down and ready
to be dumped at the curb.

01:41.051 --> 01:43.320
Hey, don't talk like that.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.954
Sure, she's past her prime,

01:44.988 --> 01:46.590
but you can still
sink your balls in her.

01:46.623 --> 01:48.458
- Oh!
- Come on.

01:48.492 --> 01:50.689
What do you say? Give it a try.

01:50.714 --> 01:52.562
- Fine.
- Yeah.

01:52.596 --> 01:54.064
- All right.
- Yeah, well,

01:54.089 --> 01:55.143
it's not like, you know,

01:55.168 --> 01:58.063
throwing a ball is gonna
make everything seem bet...

01:58.578 --> 02:00.670
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh!

02:00.704 --> 02:03.273
Did you see that shot?
I've still got it.

02:03.307 --> 02:05.095
All right, what do you say?
A little game, you and I?

02:05.119 --> 02:08.345
Oh, I think I'm gonna beat
the lady pants off you.

02:12.620 --> 02:13.954
Hey, Joan.

02:13.979 --> 02:15.885
You, uh, ready for another walk?

02:15.919 --> 02:17.354
No, I don't think so.

02:17.379 --> 02:19.705
I'm kind of exhausted from yesterday.

02:19.730 --> 02:22.726
Um, you know, I-I
promised Heather, you know?

02:22.759 --> 02:25.947
And I thought of, like,
a dozen ball jokes.

02:25.972 --> 02:27.527
I thought of two as well.

02:27.552 --> 02:29.666
One of them's historical.

02:29.699 --> 02:31.401
I'll go get them. I wrote them down.

02:31.435 --> 02:32.502
All right.

02:32.974 --> 02:35.403
Hey, this is getting much easier.

02:35.428 --> 02:37.676
Did you see me on that speed bump?

02:37.701 --> 02:38.875
I did.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.052
You know what's really great?

02:40.076 --> 02:41.678
You're wearing underwear today.

02:41.711 --> 02:44.637
Oh, you can see the lines.

02:44.981 --> 02:47.543
I was gonna say the
conversation is nice.

02:47.707 --> 02:48.902
It is.

02:52.251 --> 02:55.020
Oh! Yes.

02:56.642 --> 02:59.596
Now, all my balls are in your court.

02:59.629 --> 03:01.931
Ugh. You destroyed me, Joan.

03:01.965 --> 03:03.767
- Oh, honey.
- Well,

03:03.800 --> 03:05.119
I got bogged down trying to make

03:05.144 --> 03:07.276
a "Cinderella at the balls"
joke, but it's impossible.

03:07.301 --> 03:09.203
It can't be done.

03:09.339 --> 03:11.908
Can you imagine Cinderella squeezing in

03:11.941 --> 03:13.810
two balls before midnight?

03:14.233 --> 03:15.468
Damn it!

03:19.121 --> 03:20.684
Oh, hey, I grabbed a bunch of tickets

03:20.717 --> 03:22.328
out of Sophia's drawer
so we could pretend

03:22.352 --> 03:23.953
- that we won.
- Oh, I think she was

03:23.987 --> 03:26.390
- saving those for a laser tag.
- Ah.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.385
She's got a piggy bank
that says "College Fund."

03:28.410 --> 03:29.702
I take from that all the time.

03:29.726 --> 03:31.870
Oh, no.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.052
It's gone.

03:36.511 --> 03:37.558
It's gone.

03:37.583 --> 03:39.752
Oh, gee.

03:40.170 --> 03:42.472
- It was fun while it lasted.
- Yeah.

03:43.205 --> 03:46.580
I have to thank Heather for
getting us to exercise together.

03:46.823 --> 03:48.245
Yeah, about that.

03:48.278 --> 03:51.114
Uh... if I'm being
totally honest with you,

03:51.147 --> 03:52.882
Heather doesn't know
we've been doing this.

03:52.916 --> 03:54.150
What do you mean?

03:54.184 --> 03:56.482
Well, she wanted me to go for a walk,

03:56.507 --> 03:59.289
but I was afraid to go alone.

03:59.323 --> 04:00.733
I mean, what happens if my heart stops

04:00.757 --> 04:02.312
and there's no one there
to get it started again?

04:02.336 --> 04:03.770
Oh, Tim.

04:04.496 --> 04:05.829
I know we've had our differences

04:05.862 --> 04:07.497
- over the years, Joan.
- We have?

04:07.531 --> 04:09.666
We weren't even talking
to each other last winter.

04:09.699 --> 04:10.817
We weren't?

04:10.842 --> 04:12.145
But, these last few days,

04:12.170 --> 04:13.871
you've been a real comfort to me.

04:14.037 --> 04:17.774
Oh, Tim, this whole heart
thing can be so scary.

04:17.807 --> 04:20.176
You know, but trust
me, I think your heart's

04:20.209 --> 04:21.711
the best part of you.

04:21.909 --> 04:24.475
Aw. Thanks, Joan.

04:25.582 --> 04:26.850
Well, you want to head back?

04:26.883 --> 04:29.619
We knew the arcade had
to close eventually.

04:31.180 --> 04:33.598
I'm sorry for whatever
I said last winter.

04:33.623 --> 04:34.817
Oh, you didn't say anything.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.121
That's what hurt.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.287
Coming.

04:42.932 --> 04:45.702
Tim! Tim.

04:45.954 --> 04:47.876
- Hi.
- Joan. What...?

04:47.901 --> 04:51.408
On my way to the store, I
found an air hockey table.

04:51.441 --> 04:53.209
Just left for dead on the curb.

04:53.243 --> 04:56.012
Uh, about eight blocks away.
You think we can make it?

04:56.045 --> 04:57.314
Eight blocks?

04:57.347 --> 04:58.548
I can do eight and a half.

04:58.582 --> 05:00.183
Let's do it.

05:00.216 --> 05:01.217
Let's do it.

05:01.242 --> 05:03.981
And we can work on our jokes on the way.

05:04.006 --> 05:06.186
You'll never guess
what rhymes with "puck."

05:08.262 --> 05:10.121
_

05:11.695 --> 05:13.229
Thank you for the dinner.

05:13.263 --> 05:15.765
May I please be excused?

05:16.253 --> 05:18.504
Yes, you may be excused.

05:18.847 --> 05:21.858
We really hit the jackpot with this kid.

05:21.883 --> 05:23.583
I mean, I don't even mind
that he makes me look bad

05:23.607 --> 05:25.351
when he opens the car door for you.

05:25.375 --> 05:28.880
I can't believe that we are
parents to a four-year-old.

05:29.333 --> 05:32.089
The only thing is, what are we
gonna do with all this baby stuff?

05:32.114 --> 05:34.183
Oh, I know.

05:34.217 --> 05:35.568
Maybe we can sell it to Greg.

05:35.593 --> 05:37.727
Careful. My snake's in there.

05:37.752 --> 05:38.887
No, it's not.

05:38.912 --> 05:42.090
- Careful, my snake's somewhere.
- Oh, Dougie.

05:42.115 --> 05:43.388
Hi, Dougie.

05:43.413 --> 05:45.952
Oh, the new guy's still here.

05:45.977 --> 05:48.365
Yes, Dougie, we adopted him, remember?

05:48.398 --> 05:50.500
That's why we had you
move into the office.

05:50.534 --> 05:54.007
Right, yes. I remember...

05:55.414 --> 05:56.716
Lucas.

05:56.741 --> 06:01.342
Luke, I am your father.

06:01.367 --> 06:03.407
Bit of a risky joke for an adopted kid.

06:06.313 --> 06:07.681
Yes.

06:08.118 --> 06:11.157
Lucas, do you have any twos?

06:12.088 --> 06:14.691
Go fish, fart-sack.

06:15.712 --> 06:18.079
Did you just call me a fart-sack?

06:19.047 --> 06:20.772
Lucas, where did you hear that?

06:20.797 --> 06:21.735
Hey!

06:21.768 --> 06:25.360
Which one of you fart-sacks
took my shower Crocs?

06:25.594 --> 06:27.539
- Think I know where he heard it. 
- Mm-hmm.

06:30.594 --> 06:32.373
So, Dougie.

06:32.398 --> 06:34.693
Suddenly living with
a four-year-old is...

06:34.718 --> 06:38.249
that's just new territory for all of us.

06:38.655 --> 06:40.958
And you're setting a terrible example.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.051
You are.

06:42.085 --> 06:44.624
Okay, Dougie, we are not
asking you to move out.

06:44.649 --> 06:46.165
No, because you just
signed that two-year lease

06:46.189 --> 06:47.633
and we know how vindictive you can be.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.643
Thank you guys for noticing.

06:49.668 --> 06:52.128
All we're asking is
that you find your snake,

06:52.161 --> 06:53.439
you try and watch your language,

06:53.463 --> 06:54.846
and you just be your best self.

06:54.871 --> 06:57.471
- Or you can be someone else's best self.
- Yeah.

06:58.182 --> 07:00.136
I will consider your request.

07:02.292 --> 07:04.127
I've made a decision.

07:04.585 --> 07:06.543
Mm. I've reconsidered.

07:06.752 --> 07:08.587
And I will honor your request.

07:11.426 --> 07:13.450
Lucas, how are you enjoying dinner?

07:14.682 --> 07:15.883
Lucas!

07:15.908 --> 07:19.355
Manners. There are ladies here.

07:19.572 --> 07:21.791
Uh, Dougie, you look...

07:21.825 --> 07:23.960
Hot? I know.

07:24.330 --> 07:25.529
- Colleen...
- Mm-hmm?

07:25.562 --> 07:29.599
could you please
pass the po-ta-toes?

07:29.633 --> 07:32.502
I would be happy to.
What a polite young lady.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.466
Ah. Degrassias.

07:34.491 --> 07:38.542
Could you please
pass the po-ta-toes?

07:38.831 --> 07:40.465
Yes, sir.

07:40.490 --> 07:41.645
All right.

07:41.678 --> 07:44.013
Dougie, thank you so
much for making an effort.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.482
Ah, you got it.

07:45.515 --> 07:46.883
I would curtsy right now,

07:46.916 --> 07:50.019
but my Spanx are about
to split me in two.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.789
I want soda.

07:53.814 --> 07:55.398
Dougie...

07:55.986 --> 07:59.575
Um, "may I want soda."

07:59.600 --> 08:02.264
No, no, Dougie, we-we don't drink soda.

08:02.990 --> 08:05.168
Of course we do not.

08:05.201 --> 08:08.204
Carbonation is the devil's gas.

08:08.237 --> 08:09.405
Dig in.

08:09.439 --> 08:11.508
Mmm.

08:11.541 --> 08:12.685
Oh, Dougie, you have a
little something on your...

08:12.709 --> 08:14.744
Know what? Enough.

08:14.959 --> 08:17.094
I can't keep up this charade.

08:17.119 --> 08:20.024
It's too hard being your perfect baby.

08:20.049 --> 08:23.115
And this dinner, it tastes like poo.

08:24.013 --> 08:25.247
I'm out of here.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.138
Ow. Ow. Ow!

08:27.163 --> 08:30.636
Ah! I got angry and my Spanx just blew.

08:30.661 --> 08:31.793
Okay.

08:31.818 --> 08:34.263
Night is over, losers.

08:34.288 --> 08:36.765
This is the worst dinner I've ever had.

08:37.107 --> 08:38.238
Ah, God.

08:38.263 --> 08:41.927
Yeah, it is poo, losers.

08:48.706 --> 08:51.861
Give me, give me candy! Candy!

08:51.886 --> 08:54.017
Dougie's been a really
bad influence on him.

08:54.050 --> 08:56.319
She was singing that "Give
me candy" song all morning.

08:56.343 --> 08:58.229
- Oh.
- But it's not Lucas's fault.

08:58.254 --> 09:00.624
He's only acting like this
because he wants candy.

09:00.657 --> 09:02.721
Yeah. Do you have any?

09:02.746 --> 09:04.640
The child has asked for
some several times now.

09:04.665 --> 09:06.262
Give me, give me candy, candy!

09:06.295 --> 09:07.497
Give me, give me candy, candy!

09:07.531 --> 09:10.233
Oh, you guys, listen,
Dougie is not your problem.

09:10.266 --> 09:11.853
I mean, yeah, she is
a problem, in general,

09:11.877 --> 09:13.477
but she's not this problem.

09:13.502 --> 09:15.338
You have to talk to your kid.

09:15.371 --> 09:17.006
- But he's so young.
- Oh...

09:17.040 --> 09:18.050
Yeah, and we don't want to say anything

09:18.074 --> 09:19.185
that's gonna make him hate us.

09:19.209 --> 09:21.786
Yeah, you do. That's how you
know you're being a good parent.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.513
Sam, go do your homework.

09:23.547 --> 09:25.114
Mom, go do your housework.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.138
Okay, see? That hurt.

09:27.163 --> 09:29.341
But you get where I'm going with this.

09:29.366 --> 09:31.654
- So we got to, like, lay down the law.
- Yeah.

09:31.679 --> 09:34.354
And if he hates us,
we'll just give him candy.

09:34.379 --> 09:35.254
Okay, no.

09:35.279 --> 09:36.693
And then we'll take it back.

09:39.554 --> 09:41.031
Watch the entrails

09:41.056 --> 09:42.928
pour out like pancake batter.

09:42.953 --> 09:44.067
Lucas, what are you doing?

09:44.100 --> 09:46.155
You're supposed to be in bed, buddy.

09:46.180 --> 09:49.178
Ugh, we're watching a
documentary on autopsies.

09:49.203 --> 09:51.888
Dougie, this isn't
appropriate for Lucas.

09:51.913 --> 09:55.011
Don't worry, it's autopsies on aliens.

09:55.044 --> 09:58.369
You should see the genitals on this one.

09:58.394 --> 10:00.549
Okay, Lucas, go to bed.

10:00.574 --> 10:04.275
But Dougie said I could
watch one more genital.

10:04.300 --> 10:08.324
Well, Dougie is not
your parents. We are.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.082
Go to bed. Now.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.953
This is so hard. I hate being hated.

10:18.978 --> 10:20.334
I didn't think we would
have to feel like this

10:20.358 --> 10:21.975
until we had a teenager.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.196
Don't worry, you guys
are doing the right thing.

10:25.221 --> 10:29.192
Kids deal well with boundaries.
That's why I was kept in a cage.

10:31.581 --> 10:33.522
- I can't sleep.
- No, I know.

10:33.547 --> 10:35.719
I know. Me neither.

10:35.752 --> 10:37.243
Me neither.

10:37.297 --> 10:39.355
Can I sleep with you?

10:39.388 --> 10:41.319
- Aw.
- I got this, Colleen.

10:41.344 --> 10:42.766
We said go to bed.

10:43.032 --> 10:44.599
No, this is what we want.

10:44.624 --> 10:45.858
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:45.883 --> 10:48.722
I'm-I'm a little fuzzy
on the rules, buddy.

10:48.747 --> 10:50.349
You want to come up here?

10:52.000 --> 10:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:01.230 --> 11:05.231
So, is Dougie my brother

11:05.256 --> 11:06.901
or my sister?

11:10.661 --> 11:12.528
_

11:14.458 --> 11:16.592
Geez, Heather, when
I said I'd volunteer,

11:16.626 --> 11:18.962
I-I thought I'd be doing
morning announcements

11:18.995 --> 11:21.698
and sharing my political views.

11:21.731 --> 11:23.099
No, Dad, this is great.

11:23.132 --> 11:24.701
Gets you out, lets you be more social.

11:24.734 --> 11:26.903
Well, I've got your mother and Alexa.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.337
Well, they both need a break

11:28.371 --> 11:29.707
from being yelled at all the time.

11:29.731 --> 11:30.902
Ooh, hey! We know this one.

11:30.927 --> 11:32.842
- Hi, Soph!
- Hi, Pop-Pop.

11:32.876 --> 11:33.785
What are you doing here?

11:33.810 --> 11:35.712
I'm slinging garbage.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.746
My apologies to the cook.

11:37.771 --> 11:40.449
Oh, I didn't make that slop.

11:40.483 --> 11:43.452
I just pour sawdust on
it when it comes back up.

11:43.486 --> 11:46.089
Steve Sissel, Janitorial Arts.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.793
Oh, John Short, uh, Alcohol Sciences.

11:49.826 --> 11:53.206
- Ooh, that's my minor.
- Oh.

11:53.231 --> 11:54.488
Ugh.

11:54.513 --> 11:57.133
Uh, Sophia, why is your hot grandpa

11:57.166 --> 11:59.490
- talking to Psycho Sissel?
- What?

11:59.515 --> 12:01.484
Look, I'm gonna go clean
out the teachers' crapper.

12:01.508 --> 12:02.280
Mm-hmm.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.612
You finish up that
slop, and we'll meet back

12:04.637 --> 12:06.472
in the janitor's closet
in about 15 minutes.

12:06.497 --> 12:07.455
Got it.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.746
I didn't know that
creepy weirdo could speak.

12:09.779 --> 12:12.034
And did you just call my grandpa hot?

12:16.452 --> 12:19.823
I'll get it. I hate this
part. It's way too scary.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.328
Sophia, he's got a chain saw!

12:29.353 --> 12:31.267
You're missing it!

12:31.300 --> 12:34.812
Hey, Siss. Thanks for letting
me borrow your chain saw.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.296
Mine's stuck in a tree.

12:36.321 --> 12:38.938
Yeah, I threw it up there
trying to scare a cat down.

12:38.963 --> 12:40.828
Well, be careful with this one.

12:40.853 --> 12:45.219
It'll cut right through bone,
at least the bones of a child.

12:48.155 --> 12:50.719
That's what the weird salesman told me.

12:54.713 --> 12:56.392
Why is Psycho Sissel here?

12:56.751 --> 12:59.729
Pop-Pop met him at school, and
I think they're friends now.

12:59.763 --> 13:01.313
- What? 
- Does Pop-Pop know

13:01.338 --> 13:03.619
that Sissel steals fetal
pigs from the science lab

13:03.644 --> 13:05.268
and eats them in the janitor's closet?

13:05.301 --> 13:08.271
I heard he waits until everyone is gone,

13:08.304 --> 13:10.018
turns off all the lights,

13:10.043 --> 13:13.726
and slowly walks up and
down the school hallways.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.423
Up and down,

13:15.448 --> 13:18.647
up and down, with a mop.

13:18.681 --> 13:22.051
Ugh, he's so gross and crusty.

13:22.085 --> 13:25.054
His face looks like the
top of a cranberry muffin.

13:25.173 --> 13:26.789
I just wish he'd leave.

13:26.814 --> 13:30.028
Oh, is that so? Well, you got your wish.

13:30.386 --> 13:33.204
Hey, Siss, let's drink a bunch

13:33.229 --> 13:35.731
and then fire up this chain
saw and cut some stuff.

13:35.765 --> 13:39.803
No. I got to go clean
out the long jump pit.

13:39.836 --> 13:42.752
Preschoolers treat it like a litter box.

13:43.049 --> 13:45.374
It gets all gross and crusty,

13:45.408 --> 13:48.257
like a cranberry muffin.

13:49.905 --> 13:51.933
That's okay, I-I can always

13:51.958 --> 13:54.394
chug and cut with some other friend.

14:01.076 --> 14:02.792
Pop-Pop, are you okay?

14:02.826 --> 14:06.930
Well, I called Mr. Sissel,
like, five times, and nothing.

14:06.963 --> 14:09.983
Well, I'm sure he's
really busy at school.

14:10.008 --> 14:11.936
He had to clean all the lice combs.

14:11.961 --> 14:13.491
You know what, Dad? Listen,

14:13.516 --> 14:15.109
he probably doesn't get good reception.

14:15.134 --> 14:17.306
I mean, clearly the guy
lives in a basement somewhere.

14:17.340 --> 14:19.542
No, he's definitely
not returning my calls.

14:19.575 --> 14:22.078
I guess he's just not that into me.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.737
Well, you don't need him.
You got plenty of friends.

14:24.762 --> 14:27.516
Oh, no, sweetie. Actually,
all his friends are dead.

14:27.541 --> 14:29.059
Two are in hospice.

14:29.084 --> 14:30.394
Oh, that's right.

14:32.286 --> 14:34.688
Oh, make that one.

14:36.490 --> 14:38.186
Hello?

14:38.692 --> 14:41.628
Mr. Sissel?

14:43.388 --> 14:44.856
Mr. Sissel?

14:44.881 --> 14:46.693
What do you want?

14:49.224 --> 14:50.806
My God, it's true.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.244
They're horrible, ain't they?

14:56.021 --> 14:58.281
The science lab ran out of space,

14:58.314 --> 15:00.650
so they make me store 'em down here.

15:00.675 --> 15:01.665
Huh?

15:01.690 --> 15:03.665
You know, I broke one once.

15:03.690 --> 15:06.893
Only thing that'll get
that smell out is time.

15:07.940 --> 15:11.305
Mr. Sissel, I'm so sorry for being mean.

15:11.330 --> 15:14.939
Please don't let that affect
your relationship with my grandpa.

15:14.964 --> 15:16.799
He doesn't make many friends.

15:16.832 --> 15:19.015
Yeah, neither do I.

15:19.140 --> 15:21.805
I thought it was
because I was too chatty.

15:22.094 --> 15:23.288
But now, thanks to you,

15:23.313 --> 15:26.262
I know it's because I'm
a horrifying monster.

15:26.287 --> 15:29.613
No, you're not. I'm sure
you're a very nice man

15:29.638 --> 15:32.570
and that there's a good reason
there's a dismembered torso

15:32.595 --> 15:34.298
in the corner of the room.

15:34.323 --> 15:36.592
That's the CPR dummy.

15:36.930 --> 15:38.799
That is a good reason.

15:39.388 --> 15:41.757
So, will you call Pop-Pop back?

15:41.790 --> 15:44.290
Yeah, I guess.

15:44.579 --> 15:46.896
And, you know, the kids might
not think you're so scary

15:46.930 --> 15:48.564
if you smiled a bit more.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.444
Or you could just smile with your eyes.

15:55.638 --> 15:56.839
We'll keep thinking.

15:59.687 --> 16:01.107
Hey, guys.

16:01.132 --> 16:02.601
Sissel's got Sophia!

16:08.773 --> 16:10.695
_

16:12.835 --> 16:14.460
Jen, you're amazing.

16:14.485 --> 16:17.050
Throwing the perfect
birthday party for Lark

16:17.075 --> 16:18.968
three weeks before you're due.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.723
What's the theme?

16:22.035 --> 16:23.100
Colors?

16:23.125 --> 16:27.121
Well, Lark wanted unicorns,
superheroes, and buses.

16:28.230 --> 16:29.730
You know, I just, I just...

16:29.755 --> 16:31.522
want her to have the best birthday ever

16:31.547 --> 16:35.064
before I have this
baby and ruin her life.

16:35.089 --> 16:39.728
No, honey. A baby is the best
gift you could ever give her.

16:39.753 --> 16:42.454
When I was a baby, Matt
put me in the trash.

16:42.479 --> 16:45.363
Oh, we got you out
before the raccoons came.

16:52.966 --> 16:55.696
So, Maxine licked,
uh, Madison's Ring Pop,

16:55.721 --> 16:57.627
and I told her I'd get her
a new one, but I'm just gonna

16:57.651 --> 16:59.676
hang here for a second and
then just give her the same one.

16:59.700 --> 17:00.918
You cool with that?

17:01.675 --> 17:03.239
Yup.

17:03.479 --> 17:04.711
What are you doing?

17:04.736 --> 17:07.893
Just, uh, chilling.

17:08.049 --> 17:10.079
Uh, you sure about that?

17:10.113 --> 17:12.738
Yup. Mm-hmm. Just a little...

17:12.762 --> 17:16.425
gas every, uh, seven to eight minutes.

17:16.450 --> 17:18.364
Oh, my God, you're having contractions?

17:18.388 --> 17:21.738
What? I am having this
birthday for Lark. Okay?

17:21.762 --> 17:22.925
And it's gonna be perfect.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.928
Because it is her last birthday
where she has us all to herself.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.296
So...

17:27.876 --> 17:29.619
I can get through this.

17:29.644 --> 17:32.001
I am not having this baby today.

17:33.462 --> 17:35.004
Jen?

17:35.303 --> 17:37.601
I'm having this baby today.

17:37.626 --> 17:39.476
Is the party over yet?

17:39.501 --> 17:41.120
We were talking in the
kitchen five minutes ago.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.746
Oh, my God, time is moving backwards.

17:43.779 --> 17:45.690
Okay, that's it. We're taking
you to the hospital. Come on.

17:45.714 --> 17:47.662
- What? No! No.
- Whoa.

17:47.687 --> 17:50.653
If I have this baby today,
then I will ruin her birthday.

17:50.686 --> 17:52.403
Well, whose birthday
are you talking about?

17:52.428 --> 17:54.513
Because technically, they're
both gonna have the same birthday.

17:54.537 --> 17:55.891
Oh, no.

17:55.924 --> 17:58.317
They're gonna have the same birthday?

17:58.342 --> 18:01.192
God, why did I let you have
sex with me nine months ago?

18:01.217 --> 18:04.727
Well, actually, you kn...
I was the one that let you.

18:04.752 --> 18:07.770
My barber parted my hair on the
wrong side, and it was game on.

18:07.803 --> 18:08.904
Stranger sex.

18:08.937 --> 18:11.130
Really do not like that
that is your weakness,

18:11.155 --> 18:14.880
but you are a great mom,
okay, to two kids now.

18:14.905 --> 18:17.591
You know, so we got to balance
both of their needs. Okay?

18:17.616 --> 18:19.489
Lark having a great birthday,

18:19.514 --> 18:22.077
Tim delivering the
baby on the front lawn.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.123
Yeah, you're right, we'll go.

18:25.575 --> 18:27.106
After the party.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.901
Well, then, we got to
make this party go quick.

18:29.925 --> 18:32.232
Here... you want to know what?

18:32.256 --> 18:33.762
Lark, here. Let me help you, Lark.

18:33.787 --> 18:35.798
You just got to put
your back into it. Okay?

18:37.793 --> 18:38.793
Okay.

18:39.254 --> 18:41.590
Okay, here we go.

18:41.879 --> 18:44.213
Yay, Lark. You did it.

18:44.238 --> 18:46.008
- There we go.
- Uh, you want to know what?

18:46.041 --> 18:49.991
- Let's do gifts. Huh?
- Yeah. Gifts. Yup, yup, yup, yup.

18:50.016 --> 18:52.181
Honey? Matt and Colleen aren't here yet.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.157
Yeah, that doesn't matter.

18:53.182 --> 18:54.439
Yeah, 'cause you know
what they're gonna do.

18:54.463 --> 18:56.509
They're gonna show up late,
and then they're gonna pretend

18:56.533 --> 18:57.596
that they left their gifts at home,

18:57.620 --> 18:59.789
but you're never gonna see
it, so let's just open these.

18:59.813 --> 19:02.116
- Okay?
- Okay.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.893
Save the paper, save the paper.

19:04.927 --> 19:06.762
- Oh, my God.
- I taught her that.

19:06.795 --> 19:08.438
Okay. Greg, we got to keep moving.

19:08.463 --> 19:10.670
Yeah, ye... I like to just
rip these puppies open.

19:10.695 --> 19:13.722
And that way, we can make it snow. Whee!

19:13.747 --> 19:14.825
Greg, do you want me

19:14.849 --> 19:17.154
to make a list of the
gifts for thank-yous?

19:17.179 --> 19:20.465
No, no, we'll do it
now. Uh, thank you all.

19:20.490 --> 19:22.853
Yeah, yeah, o-ours was a savings bond.

19:22.878 --> 19:24.280
So, you just destroyed it.

19:24.313 --> 19:25.614
You know what? It's cake time.

19:25.648 --> 19:26.715
- Cake!
- We're doing cake.

19:26.749 --> 19:27.893
Let's do cake.

19:27.918 --> 19:30.837
Can't have the cake before the pizza.

19:30.862 --> 19:33.384
If all the children go
home and tell their parents

19:33.409 --> 19:35.227
that you served the
cake before the pizza...

19:35.252 --> 19:38.294
Yeah, well, life is
short, eat dessert first.

19:38.327 --> 19:41.573
- Hey-o. 
- Man, this party's wild.

19:41.875 --> 19:45.243
- ♪ Happy birthday ♪
- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

19:45.268 --> 19:47.248
♪ Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday, dear Lark ♪

19:47.272 --> 19:48.182
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

19:48.222 --> 19:49.956
Blow the candles out, wow.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.540
Don't tell anybody your wish, kid!

19:52.565 --> 19:53.676
Okay, you good?

19:53.701 --> 19:55.244
- Yeah. We did it. Let's go.
- Okay.

19:55.268 --> 19:56.455
Okay...

19:56.479 --> 19:57.646
Oh, my God.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.526
Jen, your water broke.

20:00.250 --> 20:03.344
Uh, that wasn't in any
book you ever gave me.

20:08.023 --> 20:09.382
Come here, Lark.

20:10.797 --> 20:13.834
Mommy has to go to the hospital
now because your little sister

20:13.859 --> 20:15.419
is ready to come out.

20:15.444 --> 20:16.864
Are you excited to meet her?

20:16.889 --> 20:17.766
Yeah.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.982
Yeah. Yeah, she's
excited to meet you, too.

20:21.007 --> 20:23.482
And, um, I promise
that she's gonna get you

20:23.507 --> 20:25.955
a-a great present, okay?

20:25.980 --> 20:29.417
Okay. Tell her I want a brother.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.552
Okay, well, they might
be all out of those,

20:32.577 --> 20:34.417
but I'll let her know.

20:34.710 --> 20:35.618
Give me a hug.

20:35.643 --> 20:36.848
Come here.

20:36.873 --> 20:38.598
- We love you, kiddo.
- We love you.

20:38.623 --> 20:39.934
Go. We've got her.

20:39.959 --> 20:41.375
Go over to Mom-Mom.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.792
- I love you. Go.
- Good luck, you guys.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.844
- We love you.
- We love you so much.

20:46.531 --> 20:47.830
Drive safely, please.

20:47.863 --> 20:50.698
Hi. Oh shoot, we forgot
Lark's present at home.

20:50.723 --> 20:51.924
Of course you did.
