WEBVTT

00:00.833 --> 00:03.101
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.102 --> 00:05.402
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:05.469 --> 00:07.704
By the detectives of the major case squad.

00:07.771 --> 00:09.839
These are their stories.

00:35.931 --> 00:38.066
- You see them?
- Yeah.

00:38.133 --> 00:40.468
- Full
speed, 0-4-5.

00:40.536 --> 00:43.204
Pirates, starboard. Pirates!

00:43.272 --> 00:44.405
[alarm buzzing]

00:44.473 --> 00:46.941
- Over there.
- Return to port.

00:50.279 --> 00:51.913
- [speaking russian]

00:55.551 --> 00:57.985
[men speaking russian]

01:01.890 --> 01:03.725
- [indistinct shouting]
- all right, get ready.

01:03.792 --> 01:06.127
Let's go.

01:09.665 --> 01:10.998
[machine gun fire]

01:11.066 --> 01:14.035
- Up! Up!

01:14.103 --> 01:15.036
Shoot! Shoot!

01:15.104 --> 01:16.104
- Ahh!

01:18.874 --> 01:19.841
- [pained groan]

01:19.908 --> 01:23.277
[gunfire]

01:43.932 --> 01:48.035
[all cheering]

01:59.615 --> 02:01.082
[gunfire]

02:01.150 --> 02:03.985
[cheers and applause]

02:04.052 --> 02:05.052
- Thank you for coming, everybody.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.389
Please enjoy.

02:08.457 --> 02:12.527
- You've mastered the art of
turning work into pleasure.

02:12.594 --> 02:14.729
- [chuckles] don't forget profit.

02:14.797 --> 02:17.632
Ten people, $70,000 apiece.

02:17.699 --> 02:20.435
I can book two of these
pirate safaris a month.

02:20.502 --> 02:22.937
- Let's move on to bigger things.

02:23.005 --> 02:24.372
- You have found someone clean?

02:24.440 --> 02:26.207
- Squeaks.

02:26.275 --> 02:28.709
A new york city police captain.

02:28.777 --> 02:30.044
- And he's willing?

02:30.112 --> 02:31.279
- Willing to listen.

02:31.346 --> 02:33.881
Struggling to recover
from a nasty divorce.

02:33.949 --> 02:37.385
- He's got my sympathy.

02:44.460 --> 02:45.993
- Tragic.

02:46.061 --> 02:48.396
Our father, his bride, killed on the boat.

02:48.464 --> 02:51.899
- I feel sadness,
although I barely knew him.

02:51.967 --> 02:55.102
In boarding school, I remember,
for occupation of father,

02:55.170 --> 02:56.771
I put king.

02:56.839 --> 02:57.839
- He was a sheik.

02:57.906 --> 02:59.574
- But who knows what that is,

02:59.641 --> 03:02.176
Or what he did?

03:02.244 --> 03:08.115
His death means the fun
is over for you, hassan.

03:08.183 --> 03:13.387
It's time to pray and seek guidance.

03:13.455 --> 03:15.356
- Remember how commissioner
ray kelly created

03:15.424 --> 03:17.925
An effective law
enforcement agency in haiti?

03:17.993 --> 03:20.528
That's what we want for northern somalia.

03:20.596 --> 03:22.263
An area called puntland.

03:22.331 --> 03:25.099
- What you're asking might be impossible.

03:25.167 --> 03:28.436
- Aren't most things
simply a matter of funding?

03:28.504 --> 03:31.939
Puntland's current
government borders on anarchy.

03:32.007 --> 03:35.076
Warlords rule.
- And pirates.

03:35.143 --> 03:37.678
- You can turn that around
with the latest weapons

03:37.746 --> 03:39.380
And technology.

03:49.491 --> 03:52.026
- Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

03:52.094 --> 03:55.129
- Stop it. That's awful.

03:55.498 --> 03:56.866
Where are we going tonight?

04:26.467 --> 04:27.967
Sub By: Adriano_CSI

05:08.825 --> 05:10.325
- People saw her from the bridge.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.661
The calls started at daybreak.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.730
- So she floated in?

05:14.797 --> 05:16.398
- No footprints when we got here.

05:16.466 --> 05:19.735
- Her skin's abraded from the
barnacles on those pilings.

05:19.802 --> 05:22.471
- Small
-caliber entry. No exit.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.506
No significant abdominal distention.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.874
Just enough gas to make her float.

05:25.942 --> 05:28.510
- So it might have happened last night.

05:28.578 --> 05:32.381
- Well, she spared no expense
on her undies--la perla.

05:32.448 --> 05:33.982
- Or this, if it's real.

05:34.050 --> 05:35.918
- Well, she's had high maintenance.

05:35.985 --> 05:38.120
She's got a great dye
job by a skilled colorist,

05:38.187 --> 05:39.855
First-rate veneers on her teeth,

05:39.923 --> 05:41.323
Some cosmetic work on her chin.

05:41.391 --> 05:43.258
- Well, this is cheap sari cloth.

05:43.326 --> 05:44.693
Like, 20 bucks on canal street.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.462
It's a glitch in her fashion statement.

05:47.530 --> 05:48.764
- Right, if it's hers.

05:48.831 --> 05:51.400
- So having her wear it
might have had significance

05:51.467 --> 05:52.668
To her killer.

05:52.735 --> 05:56.838
[cell phone rings]

05:56.906 --> 05:59.541
- Yeah?

05:59.609 --> 06:01.009
Okay, we'll get there.

06:01.077 --> 06:04.079
We have a middle-aged white male,

06:04.147 --> 06:05.347
Single shot to the head.

06:05.415 --> 06:09.284
Found by fishermen off
of governor's island.

06:28.938 --> 06:31.039
- Big diamond on her

06:31.107 --> 06:33.342
And a very nice watch on him.

06:33.409 --> 06:35.043
- I guess the killer wants us to know

06:35.111 --> 06:38.780
It's not about money.

06:38.848 --> 06:41.883
- So john and jane doe,
both of apparent means,

06:41.951 --> 06:45.954
Are shot execution style
and dumped in the east river.

06:46.022 --> 06:47.756
- Prints have gone to the
fbi, and the m.E. Is doing

06:47.824 --> 06:49.558
Complete dental x-rays.

06:49.626 --> 06:52.227
- The watch looked unique
to me. I checked it out.

06:52.295 --> 06:54.563
It's called a sky moon tourbillon.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.298
Now, you can only buy those in person

06:56.366 --> 06:58.634
From patek philippe in geneva.

06:58.701 --> 07:00.936
- Well, maybe a limited client list

07:01.004 --> 07:02.504
Will give us an I.D.--
What do they cost?

07:02.572 --> 07:05.007
- They're over a million dollars.

07:05.074 --> 07:08.443
- Over a million for a watch?

07:08.511 --> 07:10.946
Well, whatever he did, he's obviously done

07:11.014 --> 07:13.181
Far better than I've done.

07:13.249 --> 07:15.283
- Rodgers is ready.

07:15.351 --> 07:18.987
- Both shot with a .22 hollow point.

07:19.055 --> 07:21.256
His case, the bullet bounced
around inside his skull

07:21.324 --> 07:22.691
And broke into pieces.

07:22.759 --> 07:25.794
Hers lodged in the mastoid bone.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.596
- So with luck we might
get lands and grooves.

07:27.664 --> 07:31.099
- I'm placing time of
death around 11:00 p.M.,

07:31.167 --> 07:33.935
Shortly after they shared
a lavish last meal--

07:34.003 --> 07:36.505
Caviar au blini.

07:36.572 --> 07:39.708
He drank more wine.

07:39.776 --> 07:41.843
I'm guessing a sancerre.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.416
- [sniffs]

07:47.483 --> 07:49.918
Too yeasty. I'll go with champagne.

07:49.986 --> 07:51.687
- Who argues with an expert?

07:51.754 --> 07:54.523
- Caviar au blini-- aren't
there a limited number

07:54.590 --> 07:56.024
Of restaurants who would even serve that?

07:56.092 --> 07:57.893
- Five
-star dining,

07:57.960 --> 07:59.795
But it could also have
been a high-end dinner party

07:59.862 --> 08:01.163
Or a diplomatic function.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.165
- She has breast implants.

08:03.232 --> 08:06.368
- I know.

08:06.436 --> 08:08.070
And they have serial numbers.

08:08.137 --> 08:10.639
- Yes.

08:13.142 --> 08:14.409
- You saw the chin?

08:14.477 --> 08:16.378
That was a custom piece,

08:16.446 --> 08:18.480
Not something out of a box.

08:18.548 --> 08:20.282
People think that you just poke a hole

08:20.349 --> 08:23.752
And put in a jelly bag.

08:23.820 --> 08:26.254
That doesn't give you these beauties.

08:26.322 --> 08:30.726
This is art.

08:30.793 --> 08:34.261
- So marya onegin, 29.

08:34.330 --> 08:36.164
Is this 23rd street address still current?

08:36.232 --> 08:39.701
- No, I ran into her about
a month ago in baretta.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.437
She introduced me to this
older guy as her fiance.

08:42.505 --> 08:44.539
Said they were living on park and 63rd.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.442
- Seems like your work did her some good.

08:47.510 --> 08:50.612
- Yeah, big rock on her hand.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.781
He was buying her
top-of-the-line safari gear.

08:52.849 --> 08:55.417
- This him?

08:55.485 --> 08:57.352
- Yeah.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.521
- Safari gear?

08:59.589 --> 09:03.925
- Said they were heading
to africa, big game.

09:06.863 --> 09:09.030
- So what do you know of your great
-grandfather,

09:09.098 --> 09:11.099
Sayyid abdullah hassan?

09:11.167 --> 09:14.536
- Only that he was called the mad mullah.

09:14.604 --> 09:17.506
- He defeated the british.

09:17.573 --> 09:21.476
To discredit him, they dubbed him mad.

09:21.544 --> 09:25.046
- I have much to learn,
and I must do it quickly.

09:25.114 --> 09:29.551
- I will give you the
poems of abdullah hassan.

09:29.619 --> 09:30.952
Ah.

09:31.020 --> 09:32.954
So you will know of your heritage.

09:33.022 --> 09:34.122
You have read the koran?

09:34.190 --> 09:35.590
- In english.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.759
- Ah, english.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.828
[speaking arabic]

09:45.802 --> 09:48.804
Don't worry, I will help you.

09:59.549 --> 10:01.550
- Sorry I took so long.

10:01.617 --> 10:03.785
- No problem.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.353
Is everything good?

10:05.421 --> 10:07.055
Can they arrange a memorial service?

10:09.458 --> 10:12.060
If there's anything I can do...

10:12.128 --> 10:16.131
- Jill, would you be offended
if I can't invite you?

10:18.701 --> 10:21.036
- Family, don't worry. I get it.

10:40.590 --> 10:42.057
- Small coffee.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.128
Thank you.

10:51.701 --> 10:56.338
We have an I.D. On our
male victim's prints.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.806
- Taras broidy,

10:57.874 --> 11:01.209
Born in 1956 in lausanne, switzerland.

11:01.277 --> 11:02.744
Why are these files redacted?

11:02.812 --> 11:04.746
- There's a pending federal indictment.

11:04.814 --> 11:06.548
Luckily, the memo was probably pigeonholed

11:06.616 --> 11:08.016
And didn't reach all agencies.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.851
- All right, looks like
they've been looking at him

11:09.919 --> 11:11.653
Since 2005

11:11.721 --> 11:13.121
For illegal weapons trading.

11:13.189 --> 11:14.956
But every record's been redacted.

11:15.024 --> 11:16.892
- Yeah, I'll call judge
shrum, get a warrant.

11:16.959 --> 11:19.027
- No, we should tell ross.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.695
- But the fbi memo shows they copied him

11:20.763 --> 11:22.030
On broidy's identification.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.566
He knew it before we did.

11:24.634 --> 11:26.368
- Well, why didn't he tell us?

11:26.435 --> 11:30.672
- He might have other things on his mind.

11:30.740 --> 11:32.340
- Other things, like what?

11:32.408 --> 11:34.743
- I saw him when I finished running.

11:34.810 --> 11:37.812
Uh, he was with a woman.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.549
Our captain might be
getting his life together.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.518
- So he's getting involved with someone?

11:43.586 --> 11:45.520
- Seemed at ease with someone

11:45.588 --> 11:48.256
Who happens to be very attractive.

12:00.836 --> 12:03.805
- I could've come to manhattan.

12:03.873 --> 12:05.674
- For exploring employment opportunities,

12:05.741 --> 12:09.844
Nothing tops fresh air and privacy.

12:09.912 --> 12:12.047
- Understood.

12:12.114 --> 12:14.249
- I'm on board,

12:14.317 --> 12:16.518
Pending a certain detail.

12:16.585 --> 12:18.086
- The money?

12:18.154 --> 12:19.654
- You're asking that I spend years

12:19.722 --> 12:21.222
In a place that's hardly a garden spot.

12:21.290 --> 12:24.025
- I'm authorized to offer 2 million

12:24.093 --> 12:25.593
For a two-year contract.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.330
- Plus travel and all expenses.

12:28.397 --> 12:29.431
- Of course.

12:29.498 --> 12:30.532
And a perk,

12:30.599 --> 12:33.368
100,000 miles on our corporate jet,

12:33.436 --> 12:34.569
For r&r.

12:37.540 --> 12:39.307
Would you like to be paid foreign?

12:39.375 --> 12:40.508
- Can't do me much good.

12:40.576 --> 12:42.344
Swiss banks no longer have secrecy laws.

12:42.411 --> 12:45.880
- Cook islands trusts are inviolate.

12:45.948 --> 12:48.650
- Cook islands trusts?

12:48.718 --> 12:50.819
- We know all the tricks.

12:56.058 --> 12:59.060
- At the risk of seeming too eager...

13:09.005 --> 13:11.172
I've sold my soul.

13:24.740 --> 13:26.374
- Gold
-plated land mine.

13:26.442 --> 13:30.378
Taras broidy wasn't exactly
ashamed of what he did.

13:30.446 --> 13:32.814
- Not ashamed of the
company he kept either--

13:32.882 --> 13:34.349
Omar bongo,

13:34.417 --> 13:36.785
Charles taylor, african dictators,

13:36.852 --> 13:40.388
Radovan karadzic, war criminal.

13:40.456 --> 13:43.158
- She looks a bit more wholesome.

13:43.225 --> 13:44.559
Could be his daughter.

13:44.627 --> 13:47.128
The castle in the background
looks like England.

13:47.196 --> 13:48.897
- Looks like she dressed for fox hunting.

13:48.965 --> 13:51.132
Picture was taken over four years ago.

13:51.200 --> 13:55.570
They banned fox hunting in England, 2005.

13:57.573 --> 13:59.541
Looks like someone was putting together

13:59.608 --> 14:01.843
An album of their recent travels.

14:01.911 --> 14:03.678
- Between hard
rounds in bed--

14:03.746 --> 14:06.715
Vasodilators, cocaine residue.

14:06.782 --> 14:09.751
- What's going on here?

14:09.819 --> 14:11.953
What's happened? Where's my father?

14:12.021 --> 14:14.422
- Your flight got in at 8:00.

14:14.490 --> 14:17.258
- I was in scotland visiting my mom.

14:17.326 --> 14:20.662
She doesn't like me calling
him when I'm with her.

14:20.730 --> 14:23.398
- So I assume it was
an acrimonious divorce.

14:23.466 --> 14:25.567
- I think that's kind of personal.

14:28.104 --> 14:30.372
- He was with a much younger woman.

14:30.439 --> 14:32.040
- If she wasn't dead,
I'd think she did it.

14:32.108 --> 14:34.776
- Marya? What made her so bad?

14:34.844 --> 14:37.479
- It was so obvious
the way she worked him.

14:37.546 --> 14:39.214
She wanted him in
her idea of society--

14:39.281 --> 14:40.849
Shallow nouveau riche.

14:40.916 --> 14:43.318
My dad wasn't ashamed of what he was.

14:43.386 --> 14:44.786
- But she was ashamed?

14:44.854 --> 14:46.421
- Yeah.

14:46.489 --> 14:48.390
Dad found the weapons, made the sales.

14:48.457 --> 14:51.993
- This is almost a depiction
of the sword of damocles.

14:52.061 --> 14:54.162
Is there any significance?

14:54.230 --> 14:56.898
- Damocles security was the
name of dad's security company.

14:56.966 --> 14:59.667
- He owned a security company?

14:59.735 --> 15:01.269
Did he have bodyguards?

15:01.337 --> 15:04.239
- Always.

15:04.306 --> 15:06.608
You can check with his partner.

15:08.944 --> 15:10.512
- I always thought that taras would keep

15:10.579 --> 15:12.781
At least one of his nine lives in reserve.

15:12.848 --> 15:15.417
I've seen him in vile african backwaters,

15:15.484 --> 15:17.519
Arguing with qat-crazed warlords

15:17.586 --> 15:19.220
For the last penny on an arms sale.

15:19.288 --> 15:22.390
He always come out unscathed
with a big bag of money.

15:22.458 --> 15:23.992
- We think his clear and present danger

15:24.060 --> 15:25.293
Was closer to home.

15:25.361 --> 15:27.095
- Oh. Have you established
a time of death?

15:27.163 --> 15:28.997
I'll be happy to provide an alibi.

15:29.065 --> 15:30.265
- That certain you'll have one?

15:30.332 --> 15:32.400
- I'm rarely alone.

15:32.468 --> 15:33.902
- Which begs the question,

15:33.969 --> 15:35.837
Where was broidy's personal security?

15:35.905 --> 15:37.772
W!
- He was very casual about that.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.108
- That's not what we've heard.

15:40.176 --> 15:41.342
- From jolie?

15:41.410 --> 15:43.344
Yes, of course he had
protection around her.

15:43.412 --> 15:45.180
He was frightened she's be kidnapped.

15:45.247 --> 15:47.082
With marya, it was quite he opposite.

15:47.149 --> 15:48.316
- Opposite how?

15:48.384 --> 15:50.518
- Well, she was 30 years his junior,

15:50.586 --> 15:52.821
Surround her with strapping,
young security men--

15:52.888 --> 15:54.689
I leave the rest to your imagination.

15:54.757 --> 15:56.491
- This recent?

15:56.559 --> 15:58.660
- Vacation on the red sea.

15:58.727 --> 16:00.328
- That's an m240 machine gun.

16:00.396 --> 16:02.964
That's an odd choice
for a vacation cruise.

16:03.032 --> 16:05.366
- Some people like to shoot
skeet off their yachts.

16:05.434 --> 16:07.469
Taras liked to test his toys.

16:07.536 --> 16:10.638
- What's the line of succession
here at damocles security?

16:10.706 --> 16:14.776
- Please, my dear friend
has not yet been buried.

16:14.844 --> 16:17.545
- So when you, you know,
overcome your grief,

16:17.613 --> 16:19.848
Mr. Van dekker, who is it

16:19.915 --> 16:21.749
That takes over the empire here?

16:21.817 --> 16:22.851
Is that you?

16:22.918 --> 16:26.221
- There are no silent partners.

16:26.288 --> 16:28.189
- So the search of the victim's apartment

16:28.257 --> 16:29.591
Brought in a lot of material.

16:29.658 --> 16:31.926
We're gonna need time
to work through it all.

16:31.994 --> 16:34.662
- Also we need a warrant
for damocles security.

16:34.730 --> 16:37.765
Jan van dekker, the man
who ran it for broidy,

16:37.833 --> 16:40.335
Is a former mercenary.

16:42.938 --> 16:45.807
- Did you note that the
fbi file on taras broidy

16:45.875 --> 16:47.709
Was redacted?

16:47.743 --> 16:49.777
- Yeah, so I went to the atf database.

16:49.845 --> 16:52.547
- Those files were
redacted for a valid reason.

16:52.615 --> 16:54.182
- Right.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.351
There's a rico investigation.

16:56.418 --> 16:58.019
- Yes, they want a moratorium on this.

16:58.087 --> 17:00.054
- Okay, we've been in
these situations before.

17:00.122 --> 17:02.790
We'll keep a low investigative profile.

17:02.858 --> 17:04.559
- I want no profile.

17:04.627 --> 17:06.994
I'm honoring the fbi's request.

17:07.061 --> 17:08.363
- But it's a double homicide.

17:08.430 --> 17:11.499
We've fought jurisdictional
battles before and won.

17:11.567 --> 17:13.568
- We wait for the rico indictment,

17:13.636 --> 17:15.737
And the case will grow cold.

17:15.804 --> 17:17.571
- I'm not contesting jurisdiction.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.175
No more warrants. No interviews.

17:20.242 --> 17:21.776
- Well, do we have a name?

17:21.844 --> 17:23.545
Who's in charge of this case for the feds?

17:23.612 --> 17:26.079
- You don't need to know that.

17:31.153 --> 17:34.455
- To whom do we address our files?

17:36.625 --> 17:38.226
- Organize everything, put it on my desk.

17:38.294 --> 17:39.561
I'll see that they get it.

17:47.670 --> 17:49.404
- Were you waiting for
what I was waiting for?

17:49.471 --> 17:52.073
- Yeah, you mean a wink and a nod,

17:52.141 --> 17:54.309
Tells us to proceed with the case?

18:00.749 --> 18:02.116
- What is this?

18:04.220 --> 18:05.153
- What?

18:05.221 --> 18:07.388
- You'd better see this.

18:07.456 --> 18:09.157
I've been going through the emails

18:09.225 --> 18:11.092
From taras broidy's home computer.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.627
- Ross told us we should have

18:12.695 --> 18:14.829
Everything on his desk
by the end of the day.

18:14.897 --> 18:18.099
- Yeah, I know.

18:18.167 --> 18:20.802
"two mil for two years.

18:20.869 --> 18:24.706
Ross approved."

18:24.773 --> 18:25.974
So what is this?

18:26.041 --> 18:28.977
- An email from loftin to broidy.

18:31.714 --> 18:34.015
- Is there any other
mention of this ross?

18:34.083 --> 18:35.383
- No.

18:35.451 --> 18:38.353
The other emails are
all about some aircraft.

18:45.794 --> 18:48.363
Well...

18:48.430 --> 18:49.597
We'll ask him about it.

18:49.665 --> 18:51.799
- Yeah.

18:51.867 --> 18:57.005
So who's this roy loftin?

18:57.072 --> 18:58.606
- Um...

18:58.674 --> 19:00.441
The fbi looked at loftin

19:00.509 --> 19:03.177
As the weapons transport person.

19:05.481 --> 19:08.149
- Rents hangar space
at patterson airport.

19:20.896 --> 19:23.898
[indistinct chatter]

19:29.071 --> 19:30.805
- Wait a minute. Excuse me.

19:30.873 --> 19:33.341
- Yeah?

19:33.409 --> 19:34.609
This is so great.

19:34.677 --> 19:38.880
I came here to see an antonov 124.

19:42.051 --> 19:43.318
You're mr. Loftin.

19:43.385 --> 19:45.320
- Yes.

19:45.387 --> 19:47.188
What is this about?

19:47.256 --> 19:50.958
- You bought an an
-225 in kazakhstan last year.

19:51.026 --> 19:52.627
I mean, most people get them

19:52.695 --> 19:55.596
For the six ivchenko turbo fans, right?

19:55.664 --> 19:56.998
I mean...

19:57.066 --> 19:58.032
[imitates plane engine]

19:58.100 --> 19:59.133
Right? Talk about power.

19:59.201 --> 20:00.401
- I'm not running an air museum.

20:00.469 --> 20:01.903
What is all this about?

20:01.970 --> 20:04.038
- Well, I know that you're
not running an air museum.

20:04.106 --> 20:06.641
You have troop carriers
with weapons capability.

20:06.709 --> 20:09.610
I mean, this is clearly something else.

20:09.678 --> 20:12.547
- Hey.

20:12.614 --> 20:14.682
Is this about broidy? Are you a cop?

20:17.319 --> 20:18.519
- Broidy was your partner.

20:18.587 --> 20:20.555
- He was. I'd like to see some I.D.

20:20.622 --> 20:24.625
What department are you with?

20:24.693 --> 20:26.027
- Why would that matter?

20:26.095 --> 20:29.063
- I can go above your head.

20:29.131 --> 20:31.299
The fact that you won't
say answers my question.

20:31.367 --> 20:33.167
- Which answers my question,

20:33.235 --> 20:36.137
Which brings another question to mind.

20:36.205 --> 20:37.872
Who would you go to?

20:39.842 --> 20:43.444
- Yeah, I have an unauthorized
person in our hangar area.

20:43.512 --> 20:45.747
No, he refused.

20:49.084 --> 20:50.551
- They look fine.

20:50.619 --> 20:52.653
- Just fine?

20:52.721 --> 20:55.056
- Well, you look more than fine.

21:01.296 --> 21:03.898
- Kadra, perfect timing.

21:03.966 --> 21:05.900
Now I can finish my work.

21:07.770 --> 21:09.337
- You told me you were going to be fair.

21:09.405 --> 21:10.505
It's obvious you said nothing.

21:10.572 --> 21:11.739
- When the time is right.

21:11.807 --> 21:14.709
- I know
it's hard--

21:14.777 --> 21:18.746
Those perfect legs, long blonde hair.

21:18.814 --> 21:20.982
But it's no longer a matter of choice.

21:21.049 --> 21:22.650
She cannot be a part of things.

21:22.718 --> 21:24.051
- Like I don't know that.

21:24.119 --> 21:28.122
[cell phone rings]

21:28.190 --> 21:29.824
- Kadra, can you give me a hand?

21:29.892 --> 21:31.959
- Hello.
- Sure, jill.

21:34.630 --> 21:37.565
- So then we'll have to take action.

21:47.609 --> 21:50.611
- Seems like you made a decent start.

21:53.415 --> 21:55.516
I can read the look.

21:55.584 --> 21:58.419
It's hard being pulled off a case.

22:01.056 --> 22:03.858
- Yeah, there's that.

22:03.926 --> 22:06.027
There's also a lot of questions.

22:06.094 --> 22:10.298
- I'm sure there are.

22:10.365 --> 22:13.734
Right now I can't give you any assurances.

22:17.873 --> 22:19.740
Anything else?

22:19.808 --> 22:23.444
- No. Nothing.

22:51.106 --> 22:53.975
- That's for you.

23:00.782 --> 23:01.983
[silenced gunfire]

23:02.050 --> 23:03.584
- Ah!

23:06.989 --> 23:08.990
[cell phone rings and vibrates]

23:13.595 --> 23:15.096
[beep]

23:15.163 --> 23:17.164
- Eames.

23:21.570 --> 23:23.738
Oh, my god.

23:29.351 --> 23:31.786
- I saw him before the fbi got here.

23:31.854 --> 23:34.956
A small
caliber--

23:35.024 --> 23:37.025
I can't believe this.

23:37.092 --> 23:38.793
No, they won't let you in there.

23:38.861 --> 23:40.595
- What? - They have
their own people--

23:40.663 --> 23:42.363
- Hey, I'm with major
case. You cannot--

23:42.431 --> 23:44.565
You cannot keep us out
of a crime scene. Hey!

23:44.633 --> 23:46.134
- Detectives, I'm agent
stahl. I'm in charge here.

23:46.201 --> 23:47.535
- Hey, you heard agent stahl.

23:47.603 --> 23:49.304
- You listen to me. That's
our captain over there.

23:49.371 --> 23:51.272
- Your captain was killed
working a federal assignment.

23:51.340 --> 23:52.273
You know the law.

23:52.341 --> 23:54.175
- Yeah, working with you.

23:54.243 --> 23:56.010
- I've said all you need to know.

23:56.078 --> 23:59.947
- I saw you with him.

24:00.015 --> 24:01.916
- He was undercover. I was his contact.

24:01.984 --> 24:04.585
- Oh.

24:04.653 --> 24:06.454
- So we lost him on your rico case?

24:06.522 --> 24:07.955
- Look, we don't have
to tell you anything.

24:08.023 --> 24:09.357
Do I have to get someone from
your commissioner's office here?

24:09.425 --> 24:11.159
- This is not about cop/fed politics.

24:11.226 --> 24:12.593
He was our friend.

24:12.661 --> 24:15.396
- About a week ago, your
captain was contacted

24:15.464 --> 24:18.333
By a man named roy
loftin with a job offer.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.834
- We know roy loftin

24:19.902 --> 24:22.537
Was involved with taras
broidy's weapons trading.

24:22.604 --> 24:23.738
- Yeah, he knew we were
looking at both men,

24:23.806 --> 24:24.939
So when the call came
to him, he called us.

24:25.007 --> 24:26.874
- What was the job offer?

24:26.942 --> 24:28.876
- Setting up a police
force in northern somalia.

24:28.944 --> 24:31.045
We told him to go along with it.

24:31.113 --> 24:32.613
- A cover for a weapons deal?

24:32.681 --> 24:34.148
- Possibly related to something bigger,

24:34.216 --> 24:35.550
But I'm not gonna get into it.

24:35.617 --> 24:38.052
- So he backed us off broidy's homicide

24:38.120 --> 24:39.754
To protect your operation?
- And that still holds.

24:39.822 --> 24:41.456
We can't allow a police investigation

24:41.523 --> 24:42.657
To compete with our own.

24:42.725 --> 24:44.258
- Nobody regrets
more than we do--

24:44.326 --> 24:45.927
- Oh, come on with the regrets!

24:45.994 --> 24:49.063
You can't keep us from there!

24:49.131 --> 24:51.366
We do what our boss tells
us. You're not our boss.

24:51.433 --> 24:53.334
Our boss is over there.

24:55.204 --> 24:57.271
You're not stopping us.

25:59.268 --> 26:02.703
- I think our investigation
got him killed.

26:02.771 --> 26:04.105
- No.

26:04.173 --> 26:05.440
Our suspicions?

26:05.507 --> 26:08.309
- I ambushed loftin at his hangar,

26:08.377 --> 26:12.814
And I think he read me for a cop.

26:12.881 --> 26:14.949
- Well, we don't have time
for you to torture yourself.

26:15.017 --> 26:18.019
We have to beat the fbi to his files.

26:22.391 --> 26:23.758
[typing]

26:23.826 --> 26:27.895
- Okay, so here's his
first email about the offer.

26:27.963 --> 26:29.730
And there's an even bigger one here.

26:29.798 --> 26:33.434
The easiest thing would be
to just take the hard drive--

26:33.502 --> 26:35.670
- I wouldn't do that.

26:35.737 --> 26:37.972
- Zack.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.307
- There's a question about the legality

26:39.374 --> 26:40.775
Of downloading information.

26:40.843 --> 26:44.312
But taking that hard drive, that's theft.

26:44.379 --> 26:47.515
- We're not asking you to share the risk.

26:47.583 --> 26:50.318
- I just spent the last
hour trying unsuccessfully

26:50.385 --> 26:52.520
To console danny's sister.

26:52.588 --> 26:54.822
He was my former partner.

26:54.890 --> 26:56.691
Enough said?

27:00.162 --> 27:01.929
- Then maybe you could nd a screwdriver?

27:01.997 --> 27:05.433
- Here, here's a 16
-gig flash drive.

27:05.501 --> 27:09.303
You can download everything.

27:09.371 --> 27:11.539
Plus, look. Look what's going on here.

27:11.607 --> 27:12.807
You've made a mess.

27:12.875 --> 27:14.308
- Fine. Let's clean up.

27:14.376 --> 27:16.210
We'll fill you in.

27:16.278 --> 27:18.513
- We got financial records here.

27:18.580 --> 27:22.016
"set up law enforcement agency.

27:22.084 --> 27:23.351
Spare no expense."

27:23.418 --> 27:24.919
- So they have major backing.

27:24.987 --> 27:27.722
That means a possible money trail.

27:27.789 --> 27:29.423
- A new york city police captain?

27:29.491 --> 27:30.992
- Russell, we were all caught off guard,

27:31.059 --> 27:32.894
But you have total deniability.

27:32.961 --> 27:35.129
- Do you realize the
stink that this will cause?

27:35.197 --> 27:37.798
I mean, I'm okay with chaos in
some lawless foreign setting,

27:37.866 --> 27:40.535
But this is where I live,
where my family lives.

27:40.602 --> 27:41.903
This is an outrage.

27:41.970 --> 27:44.205
- It in no way impacts
you, nor will it ever.

27:44.273 --> 27:45.973
- But it happened.

27:46.041 --> 27:47.542
All that money?

27:47.609 --> 27:49.010
- But our side wasn't involved.

27:49.077 --> 27:50.511
Things are set to move very fast now.

27:50.579 --> 27:51.512
- How?

27:51.580 --> 27:53.014
Without the police captain,

27:53.081 --> 27:55.349
You've lost the potential to
legally ship those weapons.

27:55.417 --> 27:57.685
- There was always a plan
"b" just as effective.

27:57.753 --> 27:59.287
- More costly no doubt.

27:59.354 --> 28:01.289
- But that'll be absorbed
by the other side.

28:01.356 --> 28:04.158
What happened was not a
matter of choice for us.

28:04.226 --> 28:06.494
- You said the same thing
about broidy and that woman.

28:06.562 --> 28:08.629
- Again, it all comes
from the other side.

28:08.697 --> 28:11.465
We're not dealing with people like us.

28:14.202 --> 28:15.670
- Move things along.

28:15.737 --> 28:18.406
Oh, and don't contact me.

28:27.983 --> 28:29.650
- Okay.

28:29.718 --> 28:32.753
Why do you suppose the
fbi sent our captain ross

28:32.821 --> 28:35.656
These articles from a djibouti newspaper?

28:35.724 --> 28:37.525
- I saw them, but I don't speak french.

28:37.593 --> 28:38.960
- I was able to stagger through.

28:39.027 --> 28:40.227
It's about a local sheik

28:40.295 --> 28:42.463
Lost at sea between djibouti and somalia.

28:44.733 --> 28:46.734
- Found these pictures
in broidy's apartment.

28:46.802 --> 28:49.503
It's van dekker and broidy

28:49.571 --> 28:51.973
On an armed yacht in the red sea.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.308
Djibouti's between
somalia and the red sea.

28:54.376 --> 28:57.144
- This man's a sheik?

28:57.212 --> 28:59.280
- Yeah.
- And who's this woman?

28:59.348 --> 29:01.449
- It's his new bride.
But what's the connection?

29:01.516 --> 29:05.853
- Well, I'd say this.

29:05.921 --> 29:07.421
This was wrapped around the neck

29:07.489 --> 29:09.490
Of taras broidy's mistress.

29:09.558 --> 29:11.792
And the sheik's wife is wearing it.

29:24.640 --> 29:28.509
- Do you know this guy?

29:28.577 --> 29:30.611
- Hmm, no, I don't.

29:32.347 --> 29:34.949
- Heads up. He's coming this way.

29:44.059 --> 29:45.326
- It's awfully tidy in there.

29:45.394 --> 29:48.529
I'm lieutenant stanley maas.

29:48.597 --> 29:50.464
Chief of ds sent me to maintain order.

29:50.532 --> 29:51.699
Now, I know you searched,

29:51.767 --> 29:53.034
Because that's what I would have done.

29:53.101 --> 29:55.069
What did you find?

29:58.407 --> 30:02.209
- We haven't had time
to process anything.

30:02.277 --> 30:05.713
- We were told at the
crime scene that the fbi

30:05.781 --> 30:08.616
Has jurisdiction over our captain's death.

30:08.684 --> 30:09.817
- Huh.

30:09.885 --> 30:12.019
Well, I haven't gotten that memo.

30:12.087 --> 30:14.388
And until I do, this
belongs to major case,

30:14.456 --> 30:17.224
So pull warrants, whatever it takes.

30:26.802 --> 30:27.968
- You want to try it?

30:28.036 --> 30:29.303
Airport's only 20 minutes away.

30:29.371 --> 30:32.106
- It's not something I intend to use.

30:32.174 --> 30:33.874
- Simply a marvelous commodity

30:33.942 --> 30:36.210
That will buy you the loyalty

30:36.278 --> 30:39.146
Of every warlord and
terrorist in north somalia.

30:39.214 --> 30:41.215
- Are you suggesting I limit my scope?

30:41.283 --> 30:42.850
- Hassan, as your father's eldest,

30:42.918 --> 30:44.719
It's in my interest to see you controlling

30:44.786 --> 30:46.253
The entire horn of africa.

30:46.321 --> 30:48.689
- And the mineral rights of hamadi.

30:48.757 --> 30:50.458
Let's see, you have copper in katanga,

30:50.525 --> 30:52.059
Blood diamonds in guinea.

30:52.127 --> 30:53.728
Always something, isn't it?

30:53.795 --> 30:55.796
- Globalization.

30:55.864 --> 30:57.331
- What's this?

30:57.399 --> 30:58.866
- Battery pack. Check that date.

30:58.934 --> 31:00.868
It was serviced less than three weeks ago.

31:00.936 --> 31:02.236
- That matters.

31:02.304 --> 31:04.305
Limited battery life is the
weapon's single weakness.

31:04.372 --> 31:06.207
You can't just run down to radio shack

31:06.274 --> 31:07.641
To replace them.

31:07.709 --> 31:11.045
- These were stolen in
transit returning from iraq?

31:11.113 --> 31:13.414
- On their way to a depot in virginia.

31:13.482 --> 31:15.649
The soldiers guarding the convoy

31:15.717 --> 31:17.718
Were getting drunk at a truck stop.

31:17.786 --> 31:19.220
- Why replace the batteries

31:19.287 --> 31:20.588
If they were headed for storage?

31:20.655 --> 31:23.057
- Someone bought a lot of
hookers for pentagon brass

31:23.125 --> 31:26.694
And won a contract to
replace all fim-92 batteries.

31:26.762 --> 31:29.063
Why argue with a good thing?

31:29.131 --> 31:32.466
- Feel the potential.

31:32.534 --> 31:33.768
- It's heavy.

31:33.835 --> 31:35.369
- Not for what it delivers.

31:35.437 --> 31:37.304
Within three miles of any aircraft,

31:37.372 --> 31:38.973
Point and shoot.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.642
It's a certain kill.

31:41.710 --> 31:44.044
- Ready for a taste?

31:47.349 --> 31:49.617
- Lock in on the fire.

31:54.189 --> 31:55.790
Now point straight up. No need to aim.

31:55.857 --> 32:00.294
It will read the heat from
the flames and home in.

32:00.362 --> 32:02.363
Fire.

32:13.508 --> 32:15.176
Well done.
- Yeah!

32:15.243 --> 32:17.111
- A natural, hassan.
- Very nice.

32:17.179 --> 32:19.513
- Bloody natural.

32:26.023 --> 32:29.559
- Excuse me, sir. You can't go in there.

32:29.627 --> 32:31.094
- Hello.

32:31.162 --> 32:33.730
This is a warrant relating
to a series of killings.

32:33.798 --> 32:36.633
- Including murder on the high seas.

32:36.700 --> 32:39.869
- The horn of africa is hardly
within your jurisdiction.

32:39.937 --> 32:41.671
- Why don't you explain it, zack?

32:41.739 --> 32:43.373
- Yeah, it's interesting.

32:43.441 --> 32:45.108
A law that's been on the
books since george washington

32:45.176 --> 32:46.910
Allows for the prosecution of pirates

32:46.977 --> 32:49.112
Wherever they're apprehended.

32:49.180 --> 32:53.283
- That would be here and now.

32:53.350 --> 32:54.684
- [sighs]

32:59.957 --> 33:02.292
- Detective.

33:08.599 --> 33:12.602
- Look what we found.

33:12.670 --> 33:14.504
- [clinks handcuffs]

33:16.373 --> 33:18.007
So booked
for piracy--

33:18.075 --> 33:20.410
Actually a first for me.

33:28.385 --> 33:30.720
Mozambique, congo, liberia.

33:30.788 --> 33:32.155
This guy's fought everywhere.

33:32.223 --> 33:34.891
- Plus two years on a chain
gang in equatorial guinea.

33:34.959 --> 33:37.393
So much for the threat of hard time.

33:37.461 --> 33:40.196
- Typical fearlessness of a psychopath.

33:40.264 --> 33:42.332
- Hmm.

33:42.399 --> 33:44.000
I see a little boy
in a soldier suit--

33:44.068 --> 33:47.403
A narcissist, desperate,
craving self-aggrandizement.

33:47.471 --> 33:49.739
- You puff him up.

33:49.807 --> 33:53.376
- No problem. I'm a hemingway fan.

33:53.444 --> 33:55.512
- This guy plays his
character to the hilt.

33:55.579 --> 33:57.380
- Mm
-hmm, till you come in,

33:57.448 --> 33:58.681
Cut him down.

33:58.749 --> 34:00.350
What do we use?

34:00.417 --> 34:02.952
- I sent the gun from the
search to fbi forensics.

34:03.020 --> 34:03.953
Maybe we'll get a match.

34:04.021 --> 34:05.755
- Fbi forensics. Why them?

34:05.823 --> 34:08.925
- Their lab's the last
place they'll look.

34:16.199 --> 34:17.766
- Headquarters says they can have

34:17.835 --> 34:19.202
A federal attorney and six marshals here

34:19.270 --> 34:20.335
Within the hour.

34:20.404 --> 34:21.771
- With all the paperwork done,

34:21.839 --> 34:24.741
"I"s dotted, "t"s crossed.

34:24.808 --> 34:28.311
I want loaded dice for these pricks.

34:28.379 --> 34:31.114
- Look,
this is so--

34:31.181 --> 34:33.815
This is-- this
is just amazing.

34:33.884 --> 34:36.886
You're not afraid of diseases
or anything like that?

34:36.954 --> 34:37.887
- What?

34:37.955 --> 34:41.858
- You know, all those bugs.

34:41.926 --> 34:43.092
The "cee zee" fly.

34:43.159 --> 34:45.428
- [chuckles] tsetse fly.

34:45.496 --> 34:46.963
- I could never go there.

34:47.031 --> 34:49.364
That's definitely
not my-- my thing.

34:49.433 --> 34:50.867
And--and,
oh, yes,

34:50.935 --> 34:54.370
This luxury yacht that you're on

34:54.438 --> 34:56.472
Is such a major contradiction.

34:56.540 --> 34:58.007
- Contradiction?

34:58.075 --> 34:59.442
- Well, you know, I mean,

34:59.510 --> 35:01.110
You're the real deal.

35:01.178 --> 35:03.780
But here you are with rich tourists

35:03.847 --> 35:06.616
On a luxury yacht
shooting at unarmed boats.

35:06.684 --> 35:09.252
- No, I told you, we
didn't shoot at boats.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.753
- Yeah.

35:10.821 --> 35:13.723
And, um, from broidy's camera,

35:13.791 --> 35:15.091
You with otar tenishvilli.

35:15.159 --> 35:18.094
He's a russian oilman.

35:18.162 --> 35:19.796
That's not your kinda guy.

35:19.863 --> 35:21.998
- How do you mean?

35:22.066 --> 35:24.367
- He's paunchy.

35:24.435 --> 35:26.002
No--no
stones.

35:26.070 --> 35:28.438
When they grab otar for piracy,

35:28.505 --> 35:30.139
He'll sell you out.

35:30.207 --> 35:33.142
Isn't that how you
ended up on a chain gang

35:33.210 --> 35:34.410
In equatorial guinea?

35:34.478 --> 35:35.778
The rich backers bailed,

35:35.846 --> 35:37.247
And that's when the coup went bad?

35:37.314 --> 35:39.249
- It's called professional risk.

35:47.858 --> 35:49.192
- Ah!

35:56.100 --> 35:58.034
- Here's-- here's
hard evidence

35:58.102 --> 36:01.738
From this woman murdered on the high seas.

36:01.805 --> 36:03.273
- [chuckles]

36:03.340 --> 36:05.174
What woman?

36:05.242 --> 36:08.311
Where's the body?

36:13.717 --> 36:15.551
Feel like a bit of lunch.

36:18.222 --> 36:21.557
- We will have transport,
a livestock plane,

36:21.625 --> 36:22.725
Expensive
but--

36:22.793 --> 36:26.195
- Seems too easy.

36:26.263 --> 36:27.964
I just hope when you ship the weapons

36:28.032 --> 36:29.265
The americans won't interfere.

36:29.333 --> 36:32.035
- It's been their plan all along.

36:32.102 --> 36:34.103
Maybe they arranged this plane.

36:36.173 --> 36:38.141
- In somalia, you can dismantle the gps.

36:38.208 --> 36:41.110
- Or not.

36:42.646 --> 36:44.681
- And I once worried

36:44.748 --> 36:48.351
My brother is not ruthless enough to rule.

36:53.524 --> 36:55.858
- Did you get the ballistics?

36:55.926 --> 36:58.061
- Yes and something else.

37:08.872 --> 37:13.042
- The fiery worm of moses
lays under your skin,

37:13.110 --> 37:16.512
Devouring you like a living varicose vein.

37:16.580 --> 37:21.017
Old fundis know how to
wind it out on a stick.

37:21.085 --> 37:22.185
- It's a guinea worm.

37:22.252 --> 37:23.586
It's rampant in the great sudd,

37:23.654 --> 37:27.256
The marshlands of the nile.

37:27.324 --> 37:29.759
- He knows geography, very remote.

37:29.827 --> 37:31.627
- Place might suit you right about now.

37:33.230 --> 37:37.066
- The great sudd beats
a hangar in jersey.

37:48.045 --> 37:51.114
- Our paperwork is all in order.

37:51.181 --> 37:53.349
- Nobody moves until I've read this.

37:53.417 --> 37:55.585
- Read fast.

38:05.195 --> 38:06.496
- I told you.

38:06.563 --> 38:08.531
I only knew loftin through our business.

38:08.599 --> 38:13.035
- Were you unhappy with the
way he conducted business?

38:13.103 --> 38:14.737
- From a security camera in the place

38:14.805 --> 38:16.205
Where loftin was shot.

38:16.273 --> 38:19.142
The car is registered
to damocles security.

38:19.209 --> 38:22.912
- Equatorial guinea all over again.

38:26.083 --> 38:28.217
- You know I couldn't have done this.

38:28.285 --> 38:29.552
I've been in custody.

38:29.620 --> 38:31.888
- There's a match

38:31.955 --> 38:34.123
From the gun found in your offices

38:34.191 --> 38:37.360
To the bullet found in captain ross.

38:37.428 --> 38:39.529
- That was planted.
- He could be right.

38:39.596 --> 38:41.431
The gun, the car.

38:41.498 --> 38:42.799
I think he's more savvy than that.

38:42.866 --> 38:44.867
- There's currently a moratorium

38:44.935 --> 38:47.603
On capital punishment.

38:47.671 --> 38:50.473
At least you won't end up like this.

39:00.617 --> 39:01.918
- Van dekker?

39:04.154 --> 39:06.856
You know what we want.

39:13.664 --> 39:17.300
- Killing of your captain was stupid.

39:17.367 --> 39:19.602
I wasn't part of it.

39:19.670 --> 39:23.005
Look, for me right now,
it's all about survival,

39:23.073 --> 39:24.540
The right deal.

39:24.608 --> 39:26.375
But before I discuss it,

39:26.443 --> 39:29.745
I want a higher
authority here--

39:29.813 --> 39:30.913
A district attorney.

39:30.981 --> 39:34.784
- We can do that.

39:34.852 --> 39:37.253
- Okay, this stops right now.

39:37.321 --> 39:39.222
- They've got us. Paperwork is in order.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.157
He goes into their custody.

39:47.998 --> 39:49.265
- This is just great.

39:49.333 --> 39:51.200
You realize he was about
to cooperate with us, right?

39:51.268 --> 39:52.702
- So we'll get him there too.

39:52.769 --> 39:54.403
- And then he'll jump bail.

39:54.471 --> 39:56.072
He'll leave the country,

39:56.139 --> 39:57.540
Or get killed, or both.

39:57.608 --> 39:59.809
- I told you about bigger priorities.

39:59.877 --> 40:03.279
- Our captain is dead.
That's a big priority to us.

40:03.347 --> 40:05.314
- Detective!

40:05.382 --> 40:06.682
No.

40:06.750 --> 40:08.918
Not worth it.

40:11.922 --> 40:13.689
The gun will still work for us.

40:13.757 --> 40:14.824
- Yeah, yeah.

40:14.892 --> 40:16.158
- When he clears federal arraignment,

40:16.226 --> 40:17.960
We can re-arrest on a different charge.

40:18.028 --> 40:19.195
- If he's alive.

40:19.263 --> 40:20.863
Broidy's dead, loftin's dead.

40:20.931 --> 40:22.932
Van dekker's next.
Who's running this show?

40:23.000 --> 40:25.368
- Yeah, we're a long
way from knowing that.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
