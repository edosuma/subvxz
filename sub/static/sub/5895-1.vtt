[silence]

01:28.630 --> 01:30.215
[gasps]

01:34.553 --> 01:36.055
Hello?

01:39.224 --> 01:41.226
Hello?

01:47.691 --> 01:49.610
[loud buzzer]

02:03.791 --> 02:05.459
[loud buzzer]

02:11.924 --> 02:13.383
[loud buzzer]

02:15.552 --> 02:19.848
Stop. Don't move.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.145
They can see us.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.691
What is this?

02:30.859 --> 02:32.945
[man] I don't know.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.739
-[girl] Where are we?
-Where do you think?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.365
[woman] Hello?

02:38.909 --> 02:40.786
Oh, my God!

02:40.869 --> 02:42.746
It's all right, okay?
It's all right.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.665
-You're okay.
-Help! Help!

02:44.748 --> 02:46.041
-Just calm down.
-[woman] John.

02:46.125 --> 02:47.626
-You're fine.
-Where are you?

02:48.418 --> 02:50.671
[loud buzzer]

02:50.754 --> 02:52.881
Oh, shit.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.218
Is she dead?

02:59.513 --> 03:01.765
I think so.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.892
Jesus Christ. What was that?

03:03.976 --> 03:05.144
I don't know.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.728
[chime sounds]

03:08.022 --> 03:09.773
What was that?

03:11.483 --> 03:12.734
-[loud buzzer]
-[all gasp]

03:15.737 --> 03:17.280
-Shit.
-[gasping]

03:17.364 --> 03:18.991
What the fuck?

03:19.074 --> 03:20.909
-[man] Everyone freeze!
-Oh, my God.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.661
They can see if we move.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.915
Stand still and we'll be fine.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.959
[shocked muttering]

03:29.043 --> 03:31.920
[chime sounds twice]

03:32.838 --> 03:35.423
[man] Don't lift your feet
off the ground.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.509
[girl] Don't touch anyone.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.808
[chime sounds]

03:44.892 --> 03:46.518
-What's that noise?
-Shh.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.021
[chime sounds]

03:50.605 --> 03:51.982
[chime sounds]

03:53.025 --> 03:54.068
[woman] Oh, my God.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.277
[all exclaim in fear]

03:57.738 --> 04:00.199
[intense drumbeat]

04:02.325 --> 04:05.746
-Where's that coming from?
-Quiet!

04:05.829 --> 04:07.915
[machine powering up]

04:11.126 --> 04:12.419
[silence]

04:12.502 --> 04:14.796
Okay, now...

04:14.880 --> 04:20.510
-[screaming]
-Calm down. Calm down.
It's no use.

04:22.888 --> 04:26.391
-Susan.
-Bruce?

04:26.474 --> 04:29.019
Everybody calm down.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.939
-[chime sounds]
-[man] You need
to calm down, guys.

04:32.022 --> 04:35.734
Everybody calm the fuck down!

04:43.033 --> 04:44.952
[man 1]
Just... just think, breathe.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.411
[man 2]
What the hell is going on?

04:46.494 --> 04:48.163
[woman] No. No.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.581
[intense drumbeat]

04:49.664 --> 04:52.167
[machine powering up]

04:54.002 --> 04:55.336
[chime sounds]

05:00.634 --> 05:01.760
[man 1] Here we go.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.721
[man 2] Everybody shut up
for one second!

05:04.805 --> 05:06.807
[woman] Does anybody know
what the hell's going on?

05:06.890 --> 05:09.893
-[girl] They're killing us.
-No, it's not them.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.271
Are you guys seeing this?

05:13.272 --> 05:16.524
The lights on the floor.
You see it move?

05:16.608 --> 05:17.985
-I don't see anything.
-Over there.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.238
-[woman] What are you
talking about?
-Look at your hands.

05:21.321 --> 05:25.075
[Asian kid] When you move 'em,
it changes the floor.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.828
[man 2] Oh, shit, yeah.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.289
[woman] I only see one.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.415
Yeah, I only see mine.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.043
I think you can
only see your own.

05:42.884 --> 05:45.262
What did they do to us?

05:45.344 --> 05:48.307
-I think they messed
with our hands.
-[woman 1] What does that mean?

05:49.766 --> 05:51.518
-It's us.
-[woman 2] Us?

05:51.601 --> 05:55.689
-[man] What do you mean?
-We're choosing who dies.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.068
[intense drumbeat]

06:07.659 --> 06:08.952
[chime sounds]

06:09.036 --> 06:10.912
[shocked gasping]

06:10.996 --> 06:12.873
-Fuck!
-[man 1] What happened?

06:12.956 --> 06:16.293
-[man 2] Somebody did it.
-[woman 1] Nobody fucking
do anything.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.377
[man 3]
Well, it's not working, you see?

06:19.587 --> 06:22.132
-[woman 2] We have
to try something.
-Nobody do it!

06:22.216 --> 06:23.675
[woman 2] Okay.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.760
[intense drumbeat]

06:25.844 --> 06:27.386
-[man 1] Goddamn it.
-[man 2] What the hell?

06:27.470 --> 06:29.264
[woman] What is wrong
with you people?

06:29.348 --> 06:33.018
[man 3] All of us,
we're gonna die.
All of us, we're gonna die.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.103
We're all fucked.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.855
[chime sounds]

06:43.653 --> 06:44.946
[woman 1] Oh, my God.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.032
[woman 2] This is unbelievable.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.993
-It's a vote.
-[woman 3] What?

06:51.286 --> 06:54.622
We're voting.
Look, they're killing
whoever gets the most votes.

06:54.706 --> 06:55.749
[man] How do you know that?

06:55.832 --> 06:59.253
Because... Because
the chimes go off
when you close your hands,

06:59.336 --> 07:01.171
and that's when you choose.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.506
-[woman 4] We should
try not doing it again.
-[Asian kid] Forget it.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.051
-Someone's gonna screw it up.
-[woman 5] Wait.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.804
What if we...
What if we vote for her again?

07:09.888 --> 07:12.015
-[woman 6] Yeah,
let's try that, okay?
-Guys, that's not...

07:12.099 --> 07:14.393
-No, it's not gonna work.
-[woman 7] We have
to try something.

07:14.475 --> 07:15.518
[intense drumbeat]

07:15.602 --> 07:18.105
Yeah, everybody, let's vote
for the dead woman again.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.856
-Really?
-Are you serious?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.524
Come on. Come on.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.194
[chime sounds]

07:24.444 --> 07:25.486
[chime sounds]

07:26.863 --> 07:29.032
[screaming]

07:32.619 --> 07:35.289
-You guys picked
the wrong person.
-No, we didn't.

07:35.372 --> 07:39.042
-[man 1] Guys,
it just doesn't work.
-[woman 1] But why him?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.044
Maybe he got
the second most votes.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.462
Or the most so far?

07:42.545 --> 07:46.174
-We have to try something.
-No, it's not gonna
work, guys, okay?

07:46.258 --> 07:48.260
There's nothing we can do.
We're all screwed.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.845
-Let's try not voting again.
-Please.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.931
-[man 1] It's not gonna work.
-[woman 1] We need to try.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.641
Okay, nobody vote.
Let's wait it out.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.726
How do we know
that won't kill us all?

07:56.810 --> 07:57.936
[intense drumbeat]

07:58.019 --> 08:02.565
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

08:02.649 --> 08:06.945
six, five, four, three...

08:09.906 --> 08:11.325
[silence]

08:12.326 --> 08:13.952
Is it over?

08:14.035 --> 08:16.163
[loud beep]

08:17.789 --> 08:20.041
-Oh, my God!
-Okay, nobody move.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.378
Just, everybody,
let's ride this out.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.051
[screaming, sobbing]

08:33.679 --> 08:36.224
[man 1] If we don't choose,
it chooses on its own.

08:36.308 --> 08:40.061
[man 2]
Somebody needs to do something.
This is not working, obviously.

08:40.937 --> 08:44.441
-What you said,
that didn't make sense.
-Everybody quiet!

08:46.651 --> 08:48.862
Now, there's no reason

08:48.945 --> 08:52.073
for us all to just
keep killing
each other off like this.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.950
Well, what the hell else
are we gonna do, my man?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.202
[woman] We don't have a choice.

08:55.285 --> 08:59.706
What I mean is we can
choose to go about this
in a certain way.

09:03.335 --> 09:07.381
Look, so there's about
a minute or two
between each round.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.383
-That's not a lot of time.
-Yeah, no shit.

09:09.466 --> 09:13.470
Maybe if we spend less time
worrying about
who's gonna die next

09:13.553 --> 09:15.847
and more time
trying to figure this thing out,

09:15.930 --> 09:18.808
we'll get somewhere
and be able to stop this.

09:20.435 --> 09:23.021
[woman] What do you suggest?

09:23.104 --> 09:25.940
Okay, I've been looking
round the circle

09:26.024 --> 09:30.320
and I see... five or six people
in their 70s and 80s.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.491
If this a vote,
I say they go first.
That'll buy us some time.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.494
-[woman 1] Wait a second.
-[man] No, no. Hell, no, man.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.786
[woman 2] Are you serious?

09:38.870 --> 09:42.665
Look, the way I see it,
they'd be the next people
to die in real life, right?

09:42.749 --> 09:46.627
-What's the difference?
-He's right. Old people first.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.796
That's... That's fair.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.049
-How is that fair?
-They'd be
the next to die anyway.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.760
Yeah, of natural causes,
not of us killing them.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.179
-What's the difference?
-This is crazy.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.681
-We have no choice.
-That's fucked up, kid.

09:58.765 --> 10:02.436
It's a fucked-up situation,
but we have to do something.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.856
[man] Which one first?

10:09.901 --> 10:13.447
We'll start with him,
go clockwise after that.

10:13.530 --> 10:18.034
One, two, three...

10:18.118 --> 10:19.453
No, wait a minute.

10:19.536 --> 10:23.664
...four, five, six.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.166
That should buy us ten minutes.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.043
No. No, no.
There has to be another way.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.545
You have a better idea?

10:31.339 --> 10:32.340
Anyone?

10:37.262 --> 10:39.973
I'm sorry. It's the only way.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.311
But I have just as much
of a right to live
as any of you.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.522
-You've lived your life,
old man.
-[intense drumbeat]

10:50.233 --> 10:51.651
Please.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.156
Please!

10:59.742 --> 11:01.411
[screams]

11:03.371 --> 11:07.041
Okay. I know that was hard.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.210
But you all did the right thing.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.296
We're gonna have to make
some difficult decisions.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.423
Just shut up, all right?
We get it.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.968
You wanted to buy some time
and we did that.
Let's not waste it.

11:17.051 --> 11:21.515
Let's figure out
what the hell this is.
Any ideas?

11:22.641 --> 11:24.434
Come on. Somebody?

11:24.518 --> 11:26.603
-What about him?
-Who, me?

11:26.685 --> 11:28.855
Yeah. I mean,
you ought to know
something about this.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.315
-I don't know anything.
-Bullshit.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.193
-Yeah, yeah,
you guys had to know.
-Know about what?

11:33.276 --> 11:35.445
What about
a fucking alien invasion?
I don't know.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.489
-What?
-Look, I know
just as much as you do.

11:37.572 --> 11:41.409
-[man] Bullshit, man.
-I swear, I don't know anything.

11:41.493 --> 11:44.162
Does anybody
remember anything else?

11:44.245 --> 11:46.705
I was in Glendale.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.209
Yeah, I do.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.961
We were stuck in traffic
on the freeway.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.381
-[woman 1] Me too.
-[woman 2] So was I.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.798
Right.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.677
We were trying to get
out of the city,
but it was a total log jam,

11:58.759 --> 12:01.762
so we got out of the car
and started running.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everybody was running.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.642
Yeah, and then...
and then everything went dark.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.686
[woman] That's what I remember.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.479
[intense drumbeat]

12:19.364 --> 12:21.366
[machine fires, body falling]

12:21.449 --> 12:24.785
-[man] So what happened?
-I was pulled up.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.788
-[woman] Into the ship?
-I... I don't know.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.458
-Tractor beam.
-Fuck.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.835
So are we in the ship now?

12:32.919 --> 12:36.130
Do you think
there are other people
doing this?

12:36.214 --> 12:37.215
Other circles?

12:37.298 --> 12:39.300
[man] They wouldn't go
through all this for 50 of us.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.554
Why would they do this?

12:42.637 --> 12:46.891
I don't know. But the next time
that I could see,
I was in a small room

12:46.974 --> 12:50.978
and everything was red,
like... like a dark room,

12:51.062 --> 12:53.440
and there were a ton of bodies
piled up on one another.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.857
I... I assumed that
they were dead,

12:54.941 --> 12:57.776
but, I don't know,
they might have
just been unconscious.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.154
Everybody but me
and one other guy.

13:00.238 --> 13:03.241
-[woman] An alien?
-No. No, no, no. He was a human.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.327
-Who? One of us?
-I don't know.
I don't see him in here.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.954
Everything else
is kind of a blur.

13:08.037 --> 13:11.040
I just remember
waking up right here
and there was some kind of gas.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.918
-[intense drumbeat]
-I... I think that
we were all drugged.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.795
[man] Does anybody else
remember anything?

13:16.879 --> 13:21.426
-[machine fires, body falling]
-Come on, anybody.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.679
[man] Yeah, yeah, I do.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.767
-You?
-Yeah.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.102
I remember the red room.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.187
And I saw him.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.440
And I saw them.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.484
Well, what did they look like?

13:37.567 --> 13:41.780
Well, they were, er,
big and black.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.906
Dark green, maybe.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.533
And... and... and wet.

13:45.617 --> 13:49.828
And they spoke too.
It sounded almost like Chinese.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.415
-[man 1] Chinese?
-Yeah, Chinese.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.793
Or Japanese maybe.

13:54.875 --> 13:58.171
-[man 2] Chinese aliens?
-Bullshit.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.255
He's lying.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.633
Yeah, he's next in line.
He's just trying
to buy some time.

14:01.716 --> 14:05.928
No, I swear. Tell them.
Tell them you saw me.

14:10.433 --> 14:14.895
-You see? He's full of shit.
-I swear, I'm telling the truth.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.898
-[intense drumbeat]
-Just give me
some time to think.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.818
It's a trick. Don't believe him.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.236
It's coming back to me.
It's coming back.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.905
Numbers. I remember numbers.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.700
And there was something else
that they...

14:26.783 --> 14:28.368
[machine fires, body falling]

14:30.662 --> 14:34.833
-Now, where were we?
-Wait. Who's next in line?

14:36.543 --> 14:39.295
Her. With the hat.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.382
-Who, me?
-Yeah.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.593
-How old are you?
-52.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.887
-That's not old.
-Old enough.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.849
Hey, we said 70 or 80, not 50.

14:50.931 --> 14:54.101
-What's the difference?
-[muttering]

14:54.185 --> 14:58.815
-That's a big difference.
-Come on, lady, you're not 52.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.484
-How old are you?
-Don't lie.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.779
-I'm 52.
-Bullshit.

15:04.863 --> 15:07.365
Yeah. Why is your hair so white?

15:10.159 --> 15:13.996
Chemotherapy. I had cancer.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.167
Aren't you supposed
to be bald, then?

15:18.251 --> 15:21.713
-What kind of cancer?
-Breast cancer.

15:22.881 --> 15:27.218
-So you're dying, then?
-No. It's in remission.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.430
I'm better now.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.808
Are you sure?

15:35.017 --> 15:37.103
Yeah. I beat it.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.731
-It could come back, though.
-What the fuck
is wrong with you?

15:39.814 --> 15:42.483
I'm just saying,
she's more likely
to die than the rest of us.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.194
-That's not true.
-What are you, a doctor, lady?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.947
Actually, yes, I am, asshole.

15:48.030 --> 15:52.326
Look, cancer or not,
she's over 50. She's gonna
have to go eventually.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.411
What?

15:53.494 --> 15:56.122
-We never agreed to that.
-Yeah, no way, man.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.792
Are we gonna start killing off
people over 40 next?

15:58.875 --> 16:01.920
I'm 43. You wanna
kill me next, asshole?

16:02.002 --> 16:04.338
-Hey, you got a problem?
-Yeah, I got a problem.

16:04.422 --> 16:05.924
I think maybe anyone
over the age

16:06.006 --> 16:09.176
of maybe, I don't know, 35
might have a problem.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.262
What do you guys think?

16:12.096 --> 16:15.725
-[intense drumbeat]
-Look, hey, now,
just hold on a second.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.811
Let's...

16:21.731 --> 16:23.357
I'm just trying to help.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.234
Fuck you.

16:35.995 --> 16:40.583
[soldier]
Listen, we can't be afraid
to talk to each other in here.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.003
It's the only way
we're gonna figure out
how to stop this.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.923
Oh, man, we're not
gonna stop this.
We're just fucked.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.217
-[woman 1] We don't know that.
-Exactly. We don't
know anything yet.

16:50.301 --> 16:53.262
If they wanted to kill us,
they would have done that
already, but they didn't.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.724
So let's use this time
and try and figure out why.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.059
[woman 2] Okay. What do we do?

17:01.437 --> 17:06.150
[cancer survivor]
Maybe we should
figure out why they chose us.

17:06.233 --> 17:09.319
-[Asian kid] Chose us?
-Yeah.

17:09.403 --> 17:12.156
Why they picked us
to be in here.

17:13.406 --> 17:17.286
[man 1] It was a giant
space vacuum. I don't think
we were hand-picked.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.957
[man 2] No, he's right.
This is... This is just random.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.959
We don't know that.
Maybe it wasn't random.

17:23.041 --> 17:26.587
Maybe they chose us
for a reason.

17:26.671 --> 17:30.383
There's probably a
zillion people doing the same
thing we're doing right now.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.636
Okay, but it's
just us in here, right?

17:33.720 --> 17:37.557
I think we need to know
more about each other.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.642
Maybe if we do...

17:42.436 --> 17:44.438
this will all make sense.

17:45.940 --> 17:49.235
[soldier] It's worth a shot.
Anybody wanna start?

17:51.571 --> 17:57.035
Yeah. I'll go first.
Hi. I'm Beth.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.206
Erm... I live in Woodland Hills,
California,

18:02.289 --> 18:06.168
but originally
I'm from Richmond, Virginia,
born and raised.

18:06.252 --> 18:10.840
I've worked in human resources
for the past 11 years.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.802
I just kind of fell into it.

18:14.886 --> 18:19.015
I actually went to college
to be an English major.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.350
University of Virginia.
Go, Wahoos.

18:22.309 --> 18:25.187
I'm 36, single, no kids,

18:25.271 --> 18:28.942
but I do have two nephews
from my sister Noreen.

18:29.025 --> 18:34.154
She's actually my twin sister.
What else?

18:34.238 --> 18:39.077
Oh, I have a dog.
Her name is Clootie
and she's a terrier mix.

18:39.159 --> 18:42.288
-And I have two cats,
JJ and Ricky.
-[intense drumbeat]

18:42.371 --> 18:44.373
Oh, my God.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.711
I think that's about it.
Is there anything else
I should say?

18:48.795 --> 18:53.967
No, that's great. Great job.
Who wants to go next?

18:54.050 --> 18:55.468
Fuck!

19:00.640 --> 19:03.225
-At least she didn't have kids.
-Yeah, yeah.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.144
-That's what I was thinking.
-Me too.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.688
[woman 1] So what?
That doesn't matter.

19:07.772 --> 19:11.358
She was still a human being
just like any of you.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.070
-[woman 2] What was her name?
-[man 1] Beth.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.696
[man 2] Maybe we shouldn't
say our names.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.824
[woman 3] Why not?

19:17.907 --> 19:18.950
How does it help?

19:19.033 --> 19:20.952
What's the point
in talking at all, then?

19:21.035 --> 19:23.412
No, no names, he's right.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.832
We don't need
to make this harder
than it already is.

19:25.915 --> 19:29.418
Yeah, yeah.
I mean,
if it's anonymous, it's...

19:29.502 --> 19:31.671
What? Easier to kill everyone?

19:31.754 --> 19:34.214
That's not what I was gonna say.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.467
-I'll say it, then.
-It doesn't matter.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.178
Names aren't necessary.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.140
Someone else should speak.
How about you?

19:43.390 --> 19:44.934
-Me?
-Yeah, you're next in line.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.103
Well, fuck that, man.
I ain't saying shit.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.605
You seen what happened
to her and she didn't say
nothing wrong.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.691
[man 1] Well, someone
should speak.

19:52.900 --> 19:57.571
[man 2] Okay, I will.
I'll try to keep this short.

19:57.655 --> 20:00.199
-My name's Craig...
-[man 1] Hey, no names.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.284
Right. I'm sorry.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.871
Anyway, the reason
I'm saying anything

20:04.954 --> 20:07.957
is because
my wife is standing next to me.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.752
I thought that
would be important. That can't
just be a coincidence, right?

20:11.836 --> 20:16.215
[man 1]
Is anyone else related? Anybody?

20:17.466 --> 20:19.969
-[man 1] Know each other?
-Yes.

20:21.428 --> 20:25.265
I know her. Susan.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.060
[man 1] How?

20:27.894 --> 20:31.814
-We're, er... co-workers.
-Neighbors.

20:33.315 --> 20:37.444
Never mind. It's not important.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.655
Affair. Got it.

20:45.161 --> 20:49.415
Anyway, I just wanted
to ask everyone respectfully,

20:49.498 --> 20:50.666
please don't vote for my wife.

20:50.750 --> 20:55.295
You can vote for me,
but please just spare my wife.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.964
[intense drumbeat]

20:57.048 --> 20:58.758
No.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.594
No, everyone will take that
into consideration.

21:01.677 --> 21:02.720
Okay, thanks.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.180
[chiming]

21:08.726 --> 21:10.477
[machine fires, body falling]

21:16.067 --> 21:20.613
Er... Okay. You go next.

21:21.614 --> 21:25.868
Come on, go.
Hey, you speak English?

21:28.621 --> 21:29.997
Oh, well, he's gone.

21:30.081 --> 21:32.083
It's okay. I speak Spanish.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.293
[man 1] We don't need
a fucking translator.

21:34.376 --> 21:37.088
[man 2] Yeah, I'm sorry,
but he's right,
it's a waste of time.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.589
No, it's not.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.883
[speaks Spanish]

21:45.012 --> 21:47.056
[speaks Spanish]

21:54.814 --> 21:58.234
-[man 1] What's he saying?
-[man 2] See?
It's already wasting time.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.360
[translator] No, it's not.
We're all human beings.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.321
[woman 2] Yeah,
we all count the same in here.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.199
We shouldn't kill someone else

22:05.283 --> 22:08.577
over someone who
can't even contribute
to the conversation.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.370
[Asian kid] He's right.
That's not fair.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.665
I mean, I'll bet
he's not even here legally.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.083
[woman] Oh, my God.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.294
What, now you need a green card
to be fucking abducted?

22:16.376 --> 22:19.672
You know what I'm saying.
I mean, he shouldn't
even be here.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.423
What does that matter?

22:21.507 --> 22:24.802
Ask him if he was
in the country legally.

22:26.304 --> 22:28.306
Ask him.

22:32.185 --> 22:33.978
[speaks Spanish]

22:36.689 --> 22:39.275
-[says "no" in Spanish]
-Ah, see?

22:39.357 --> 22:41.568
-[woman] Come on.
It doesn't matter.
-Sure it does.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.946
This guy was probably
hanging out in front of
The Home Depot

22:44.030 --> 22:45.405
with 20 other illegal aliens.

22:45.489 --> 22:46.490
Whatever.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.201
While we were running away
from the ships,

22:48.284 --> 22:50.368
he was running
towards 'em going,
"Trabajo! Trabajo!"

22:50.452 --> 22:53.289
Asshole, these guys
work their asses off
for barely minimum wage.

22:53.371 --> 22:55.749
-[intense drumbeat]
-[man 1] Taking
American people's jobs.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.084
[man 2] Here we go, huh?

22:57.168 --> 22:58.961
[rich man] What,
you don't think I work hard?

22:59.045 --> 23:01.672
[one-armed man]
Yeah, I'm sure your
corner office is a real drag.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.436
[man speaks Spanish]

23:17.271 --> 23:18.981
[man] Hey. Hey.

23:20.398 --> 23:23.236
-[tattooed man] Who, me?
-Yeah, don't I know you?

23:23.319 --> 23:26.072
-Huh! I wonder why.
-[cop] No, seriously.

23:26.155 --> 23:29.783
He asked if we knew
anyone in here.
I know him.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.786
I don't know you, man.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.914
[cop] You're a mechanic
in North Hollywood.

23:36.040 --> 23:41.337
Raul. Raul Jimenez.
I remember you.

23:41.419 --> 23:44.257
-What'd he do?
-I didn't do shit.
He's lying, man.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.466
[cop] He beat
the shit out of his girlfriend.

23:47.425 --> 23:50.137
Really bad.
At least I think
it was his girlfriend.

23:50.221 --> 23:53.473
-Hopefully not any more.
-Come on, man. Serious?

23:53.557 --> 23:55.601
Are you sure it was him?

23:55.684 --> 24:00.147
Yeah. I remember him
'cause of that tattoo
under his right eye.

24:00.231 --> 24:01.857
That teardrop. See it?

24:01.941 --> 24:04.651
-Fuck you, man.
-[doctor] What's it for?

24:04.735 --> 24:10.283
It's for my cousin. He got shot.
By a pig like you.

24:10.366 --> 24:12.618
Yeah, and it's my fault
you guys are criminals.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.662
-[Raul] He was 16.
-One less criminal
on the street.

24:15.746 --> 24:17.706
Fuck you, man.

24:17.790 --> 24:22.295
-Is it true or not?
-About his cousin? I don't know.

24:22.378 --> 24:28.217
-[doctor] No, about him.
-Yeah, it's true. Tell them.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.762
Tell them how you
beat the shit out of her.

24:32.679 --> 24:36.976
And it wasn't the first time
and it won't be
the last time, either.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.394
Tell 'em!

24:38.476 --> 24:40.229
Okay, maybe
we shouldn't stereotype in here.

24:40.313 --> 24:41.939
Bitch got
what she deserved, man.

24:42.022 --> 24:45.985
There he is, see?
These assholes. Man,
these assholes never learn.

24:46.068 --> 24:48.321
She shouldn't have
fucked around on me, man.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.656
Like that makes it okay
to beat the shit out of her.

24:50.739 --> 24:54.201
Oh, yeah? What are you
gonna do, man?

24:54.285 --> 24:57.495
-You gonna shoot me, huh, pig?
-[intense drumbeat]

24:57.579 --> 24:59.999
I don't think I need to.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.506
[woman] Recognize anyone else?

25:08.590 --> 25:11.093
-No, I don't think so.
-[one-armed man] Yeah,
anybody else?

25:11.177 --> 25:13.804
-Unpaid parking tickets?
-[chuckles]

25:13.887 --> 25:16.556
-What if that's important?
-Huh?

25:16.640 --> 25:22.271
Like... maybe we're
supposed to figure out
who's good and who's bad.

25:22.355 --> 25:24.440
[cop] World doesn't
work that way, sweetheart.

25:24.482 --> 25:27.818
[Bruce] That's right.
Too much gray area.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.987
[woman] But maybe
that's what they want us to do.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.324
Kill off certain people.

25:33.407 --> 25:37.453
[rich man] And like, oh, my God,
who's gonna decide? You?

25:37.535 --> 25:43.583
No, not me.
All of us, as a group.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.295
[Asian kid] Kind of
what we're doing already.

25:46.379 --> 25:49.173
Kind of not stopping
this whole thing at all.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.884
We don't know that. It might.

25:51.967 --> 25:55.304
There has to be a reason
behind all of this, right?

25:55.388 --> 25:56.930
Oh, my God, sweetheart.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.016
Not every shitty thing
that happens in this world

25:59.099 --> 26:00.726
has to have a reason behind it.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.729
Maybe they just
wanna fucking watch us
kill each other.

26:06.857 --> 26:10.110
Well, we should
at least consider it.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.531
[Bruce] Consider what?

26:13.613 --> 26:18.576
What she means is...
who deserves to live?

26:24.917 --> 26:27.920
Okay. Based on what?

26:28.003 --> 26:30.214
Based on everything.

26:30.297 --> 26:34.468
Morals, values, what you have
or haven't done in life.

26:34.552 --> 26:37.054
I think we need
to put it all out there.

26:37.137 --> 26:41.225
[man 1] We got plenty of time
standing around debating
everybody's character.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.310
Well, we're here
to do something.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.396
[man] It's to die.

26:51.193 --> 26:53.987
Hey, hey, I got an idea.

26:55.155 --> 26:59.410
How about we...
How about we kill
all the black people next, yeah?

26:59.493 --> 27:00.953
What are you talking about?

27:01.036 --> 27:04.957
Don't play the race card, man.
This is all just fucking chance.

27:05.040 --> 27:09.420
Yeah? Right. That's why
most of us are dead, right?

27:09.503 --> 27:11.088
It's every man
for himself in here.

27:11.171 --> 27:14.174
Yeah, you need to shut up
with this racism stuff, okay?

27:14.258 --> 27:17.094
-Nobody gives a shit
around here.
-I give a shit around here.

27:17.177 --> 27:20.514
Look, I'm just saying,
I'm not fucking next, all right?

27:20.598 --> 27:22.933
Y'all done
reached your minority quota.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.478
That's fair.

27:25.561 --> 27:28.272
This guy. Man, you see anything
fair going on in here?

27:28.355 --> 27:31.108
This is the exact fucking
opposite of fair!

27:32.151 --> 27:34.652
Okay. We'll see.

27:40.326 --> 27:43.496
Don't look at me, man.
You started this shit.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.831
Come on, man.
You know I'm right, bro.

27:46.748 --> 27:47.791
Think about it.

27:47.874 --> 27:52.712
They'll kill
each and every one of us off
until there's none of us left.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.382
[husband] Come on, man.
Plenty of white people
are dead too.

27:55.466 --> 27:58.260
Come on, man.
There's plenty more
still alive too.

27:58.344 --> 28:02.181
What exactly are you
trying to do with this?
Make yourself a target?

28:02.264 --> 28:04.016
Because that's exactly
what you're doing.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.101
Yeah, real smart.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.479
You don't see me
counting Asians.

28:08.562 --> 28:13.066
-Well, maybe you should try.
-Don't fall for this
racism bullshit.

28:13.150 --> 28:14.652
He's just trying
to save his own ass.

28:14.734 --> 28:18.614
You damn right,
you uptight asshole.
So what?

28:18.696 --> 28:22.618
So, what, you feel like
you deserve a free pass
because you're fucking black?

28:22.700 --> 28:24.870
Nobody cares.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.121
Exactly. Nobody gives a shit.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.706
-I ain't talking
to your stupid ass.
-I'm trying to help you, bro!

28:28.790 --> 28:30.626
You shut the fuck up
talking to me, man.

28:30.708 --> 28:33.337
It's not gonna fucking
help you in here.

28:34.421 --> 28:37.550
Right, 'cause it usually
helps me out there, right?

28:37.633 --> 28:41.970
Here we go.
Let's all feel bad
for the black guy.

28:44.014 --> 28:45.849
'Cause he had to struggle
so much more than we did.

28:45.932 --> 28:48.477
All right, just drop it.

28:50.312 --> 28:52.356
Like you people
don't get enough help.

28:53.899 --> 28:57.319
-What the fuck you just say?
-[cop] You guys
are all the same.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.072
You run around,
you just want people
to hand you things

29:00.155 --> 29:01.865
like you fucking earned it.

29:01.948 --> 29:04.868
That's what's wrong
with this country now.

29:05.703 --> 29:07.996
Socialist bullshit.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.623
[intense drumbeat]

29:09.707 --> 29:13.460
What? You want
some reparations too?

29:16.589 --> 29:20.384
I mean, Jesus Christ,
give me a fucking break
around here!

29:26.139 --> 29:29.643
I think we need to keep
our personal prejudices
out of this.

29:29.727 --> 29:32.438
-It's not helping the situation.
-[woman] They don't
matter any more.

29:32.521 --> 29:35.941
No, no, hell, no,
they absolutely matter, to me.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.777
I'm not gonna die
so some racist can live.

29:38.860 --> 29:42.239
Everything, every single thing
needs to be out there
on the table.

29:42.322 --> 29:45.576
[man] Yeah, so if we could have
all the racists step forward,
that'd be great.

29:45.659 --> 29:51.624
Look, whatever your race,
ethnicity, nationality,
it's not important.

29:51.707 --> 29:55.085
What's important
is that collectively
we figure out how to stop this.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.170
-We're on the same team here.
-Are we, though?

29:57.254 --> 30:00.882
-We all wanna live, don't we?
-[teenage girl] Yeah.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.510
So let's work together.
We can't keep
turning against each other.

30:03.594 --> 30:06.597
-Yeah, that's what
they want us to do.
-[soldier] I think she's right.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.099
That's what this about.
They want us
to play their little game.

30:09.182 --> 30:11.351
-Maybe they're
watching us right now.
-[man] Studying us.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.687
-Let's not give them
what they want.
-[woman 1] Exactly.

30:13.771 --> 30:15.439
[woman 2] Any ideas?

30:15.522 --> 30:18.108
[soldier] What happens
if we force a tie?

30:18.191 --> 30:21.987
-We tried that.
-[soldier] We tried
not voting at all.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.658
There'd be more time
between rounds.

30:27.242 --> 30:30.663
[wife] Okay, everybody
vote for yourself.

30:31.871 --> 30:34.207
[cancer survivor]
How do we do that?

30:34.291 --> 30:36.918
Well, you can't
vote for yourself.
It doesn't let us.

30:37.002 --> 30:40.589
[soldier] All right,
then everybody vote for
the person to your right, then.

30:40.673 --> 30:43.383
-[woman] The living person.
-[soldier] Don't vote
for empty spaces.

30:43.467 --> 30:46.886
If we do it right,
we should all get
exactly one vote.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.388
[woman] Okay.

30:49.931 --> 30:53.893
[man] Ten, nine, eight, seven,

30:53.977 --> 30:57.063
six, five, four,

30:57.147 --> 30:59.733
three, two, one...

31:01.485 --> 31:02.486
-No!
-Oh, fuck!

31:02.569 --> 31:04.571
-Damn it!
-It didn't work.

31:05.322 --> 31:07.741
-What happened?
-We screwed up.

31:07.825 --> 31:08.826
Let's try it again.

31:08.908 --> 31:10.577
It won't work.
They thought of everything!

31:10.661 --> 31:12.705
Did you vote for the person
to your right or your left?

31:12.788 --> 31:15.123
I did right, this way.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.042
[man]
Well, somebody messed it up.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.252
Somebody just made a mistake.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.046
Okay, look, we have
to try this again.

31:21.129 --> 31:24.257
[soldier] All right.
Very carefully this time.

31:24.341 --> 31:27.135
Everybody vote for the arrow
that points to the person
on your right.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.470
Got it?

31:33.933 --> 31:35.435
[intense drumbeat]

31:37.437 --> 31:39.231
Sweetie, you see that arrow?

31:39.314 --> 31:42.693
This arrow. You're gonna...
You're gonna
pick that arrow, okay?

31:43.736 --> 31:48.782
[pregnant woman] You're okay.
No, we're all gonna be okay,
I promise. Okay?

31:58.083 --> 31:59.543
[intense drumbeat]

32:10.679 --> 32:12.639
-[gasping]
-[man 1] Come on!

32:12.723 --> 32:14.974
[man 2] It's a tie.
Everyone vote again!

32:18.061 --> 32:20.397
[pregnant woman sobs]

32:25.193 --> 32:26.986
[black man]
What the fuck just happened?

32:27.070 --> 32:28.697
-[man] They tied.
-[woman] How?

32:28.781 --> 32:31.825
We all got
the same number of votes, right?

32:31.909 --> 32:33.285
No, we didn't.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.454
How do you know?

32:35.537 --> 32:37.706
'Cause I voted for him.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.625
-What are you...
-Why would you do that?

32:39.708 --> 32:42.461
Because he voted
for the pregnant girl.
I saw him.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.254
If I didn't vote for him,
she'd be dead.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.339
-[rich man] You sure?
-Yes.

32:47.340 --> 32:49.551
Why would he do that?

32:49.635 --> 32:55.223
Look, we all know
that we can't vote
for ourselves, right?

32:57.183 --> 33:01.563
Well, what do you think happens

33:01.647 --> 33:04.065
when we get down
to the last person left?

33:09.321 --> 33:11.323
One of us gets to live.

33:13.241 --> 33:16.161
It's a game.
It's process of elimination.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.622
The last man standing
gets to walk out of here alive.

33:18.705 --> 33:19.706
[woman] Or woman.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.374
[cancer survivor]
Why would they do that?

33:21.458 --> 33:23.084
I don't know.

33:23.168 --> 33:27.673
But between the kid
and the pregnant girl,
I'm sure that guy figured

33:27.756 --> 33:30.759
it's most likely gonna come down
to one of them in the end.

33:33.553 --> 33:36.473
If we get rid of them,
we'll all have a better chance.

33:40.978 --> 33:44.439
[one-armed man] You know what?
If he's right. If one of us do
get to walk out of here,

33:44.523 --> 33:46.525
it should be one of them.

33:47.985 --> 33:51.613
-Why's that?
-'Cause it's common sense.

33:52.823 --> 33:55.909
People, come on.
Things are different in here.

33:55.993 --> 34:00.246
Women and children first?
I'm sorry, but that shit
doesn't matter any more.

34:01.122 --> 34:05.251
Look at the pregnant woman.
She counts as two people.

34:05.335 --> 34:08.547
[rich man] One of them's
gonna die eventually, so...

34:08.630 --> 34:11.049
-[Asian kid] Which one?
-[intense drumbeat]

34:17.723 --> 34:20.893
It's okay. It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.021
[pregnant woman] No! No!

34:24.103 --> 34:26.857
-No!
-Come on, come on, come on.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.985
-Don't do anything.
-They'll both die.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.737
[rich man]
We have to know what happens.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.322
[child cries]

34:34.406 --> 34:36.199
[body falls, child shrieks]

34:39.995 --> 34:42.163
What is wrong with you people?

34:42.246 --> 34:45.208
She's just a kid.
Why would you go after her?

34:45.291 --> 34:47.585
[Asian kid] Well, one of 'em
has to die.
We need to decide.

34:47.668 --> 34:48.712
[translator] No, we don't.

34:48.795 --> 34:51.130
We should just leave 'em
out of this
for as long as possible.

34:51.214 --> 34:53.632
-Let's just forget about it.
-No, we can't do that,
not any more.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.467
-[man] Why not?
-It's too dangerous for them.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.012
-They've been exposed.
-Come on.

34:57.094 --> 35:00.724
No one is going to
vote for them again, right?

35:00.807 --> 35:04.436
She's never heard
of birth control,
so she gets to live?

35:04.519 --> 35:08.147
We need to come
to a majority decision
before each elimination

35:08.231 --> 35:10.943
otherwise they are constantly
gonna be in jeopardy.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.403
He's right.
We need to protect them now.

35:13.486 --> 35:16.239
We don't even know
what kind of a kid she is.

35:16.322 --> 35:19.618
I mean, what if
she's a miserable brat?

35:19.701 --> 35:24.539
-She's like ten.
-Hey, kid. You get good grades?

35:24.623 --> 35:27.084
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah. Straight As?

35:27.166 --> 35:28.334
[intense drumbeat]

35:28.418 --> 35:31.088
Oh, my God, she got a B.
Let's kill her.

35:31.170 --> 35:34.466
Look, at least one of them
is gonna have to die.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.342
So we should decide now.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.055
[both cry]

35:42.265 --> 35:44.142
Just kill 'em both.
Just fucking kill 'em...

35:44.225 --> 35:45.936
[screaming]

35:56.989 --> 35:58.824
What about volunteers?

35:58.907 --> 36:00.867
-What?
-[woman] Volunteers?

36:00.951 --> 36:02.494
[Asian kid] Are you nuts?

36:02.577 --> 36:05.288
I don't know.
Maybe someone
wants to step forward.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.557
[man] I'll do it.

36:28.937 --> 36:30.563
-Why?
-[rich man] Now, wait a minute.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.109
He doesn't have to tell you
or anybody else why.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.902
He's volunteered.
That's enough.

36:35.986 --> 36:37.529
[cancer survivor]
I wanna know why.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.572
Lady, it's none
of your business.

36:39.656 --> 36:42.659
[Bruce] Hey, let him answer.

36:42.742 --> 36:45.120
[cancer survivor] Why?

36:45.203 --> 36:48.165
I guess I just don't
wanna kill anyone.

36:48.247 --> 36:51.835
-How old are you?
-16.

36:53.003 --> 36:56.923
-No. Someone else.
-What do you mean, someone else?

36:57.007 --> 37:00.677
-He's a fucking kid, man.
-He's 16. That's old enough.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.513
-Old enough to what, to die?
-To make your own decisions.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.390
He's a stupid kid.
He doesn't know any better.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.726
I don't care.
If you volunteer, you volunteer.

37:07.809 --> 37:10.937
-It's his choice
if he wants to die.
-Yeah, yeah, that's right.

37:11.021 --> 37:15.025
If someone wants to volunteer,
we should respect that,
no matter who it is.

37:15.108 --> 37:17.777
Son, what's your name?

37:19.612 --> 37:22.866
-I'm Shaun.
-Shaun.

37:22.949 --> 37:26.203
Are you sure that
you wanna volunteer?

37:30.123 --> 37:31.374
[man] No.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.503
I'll do it.

37:38.965 --> 37:42.719
-It's fine.
-[intense drumbeat]

37:51.603 --> 37:54.106
[machine fires, body falling]

37:55.899 --> 38:00.112
Well, this is gonna be
a whole lot easier if we
can get a few volunteers.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.781
Easier for who? You?

38:02.864 --> 38:09.037
Look, we gotta take control
of the... the situation,
and this is the best way.

38:09.121 --> 38:12.624
I mean, hey, if we're all
gonna die, it might as well
be on our own terms.

38:12.707 --> 38:15.001
Yeah, yeah,
that'll teach
those fucking aliens.

38:15.085 --> 38:16.920
Hey, we're doing
what we can, man.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.546
Yeah, it's the best idea we got.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.007
-Then you volunteer.
-I don't see you
stepping forward.

38:21.091 --> 38:24.219
We should all step forward.
I mean, everybody but her.

38:24.302 --> 38:29.015
So mass suicide, then?
That's great. Let's do that.

38:29.099 --> 38:33.770
Hey, kid, you still
wanna volunteer?

38:33.853 --> 38:34.896
[man] No.

38:37.190 --> 38:38.733
Yes.

38:40.526 --> 38:42.737
You're a fucking hero, kid,
you know that?

38:43.738 --> 38:45.991
-Yeah, right.
-[rich man] No, I'm serious.

38:46.074 --> 38:50.745
Look, if I make it out of here,
I'm naming my next kid
after you.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.081
[intense drumbeat]

38:59.378 --> 39:01.422
-Thanks, Scott.
-Thank you, Scott.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.216
[machine fires, body falling]

39:03.300 --> 39:05.343
[cries]

39:05.426 --> 39:09.014
Fucking assholes.
You knew his name was Shaun.

39:09.097 --> 39:11.975
-Whatever. The kid's a hero.
-[Asian kid] He bought us
two minutes.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.978
-Somebody toss him
a Purple Heart.
-All right, enough.

39:23.361 --> 39:27.365
[soldier] What?
What are you looking at me for?

39:31.328 --> 39:33.288
You think it should be me?

39:37.167 --> 39:38.918
I was in Afghanistan
for the past two years

39:39.002 --> 39:41.880
risking my life
to keep the rest of you safe.

39:44.257 --> 39:46.259
I just got back two days ago.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.805
I was on my way
to see my family.

39:53.599 --> 39:55.601
I got a seven-month-old...

39:57.520 --> 39:59.522
who doesn't even know who I am.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.109
My wife...

40:05.153 --> 40:07.155
I haven't seen my wife in...

40:11.701 --> 40:15.872
I'm not fucking dying in here.
I'm not.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.335
I'm going home to them.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.962
[cancer survivor] Don't worry.
I'm not voting for you.

40:23.046 --> 40:24.547
[woman] Me neither.

40:24.630 --> 40:26.841
[black man] Yeah,
we're gonna
get out of here, man.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.760
-Yeah, sure we are.
-[black man] Come on, man.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.304
No, you come on, man.
He knows the truth.

40:32.222 --> 40:36.768
-We all do.
Let's just accept it.
-Just stop.

40:37.643 --> 40:40.939
You're gonna die, dude.
We all are.

40:41.022 --> 40:46.194
-Time is running out.
-[man] Yeah.
We still need a volunteer.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.696
Anybody.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.203
I volunteer.

41:04.670 --> 41:09.092
My son, Oscar,

41:09.175 --> 41:11.344
he passed away last year.

41:15.807 --> 41:20.437
He was riding his motorcycle.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.945
It's okay.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.701
I forgive her.

41:42.375 --> 41:45.253
-You'll see him again.
-You think?

41:46.296 --> 41:47.922
Absolutely.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.467
Okay.

41:51.343 --> 41:53.345
I go in peace.

41:55.305 --> 41:57.307
Bye, everybody.

41:58.057 --> 41:59.184
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

41:59.267 --> 42:00.685
Goodbye.

42:03.480 --> 42:05.273
[machine fires, body falling]

42:09.819 --> 42:13.490
"You'll seem
him again. Absolutely."

42:14.491 --> 42:16.701
-Bullshit.
-[Asian kid] Yeah, seriously.

42:16.784 --> 42:20.497
He was just trying
to give her some peace
in her last moments of life.

42:20.579 --> 42:23.082
There's nothing wrong with that.

42:23.166 --> 42:27.462
She sacrificed herself
so that others could live.
That doesn't go unnoticed.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.214
-Says who?
-Says God.

42:29.297 --> 42:32.050
-How do you know?
-I'm a minister.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.262
God is watching over all of us.

42:36.346 --> 42:38.764
He has a plan.
We just have to have faith.

42:38.848 --> 42:41.017
-Amen.
-[Asian kid] Enough, man.

42:42.894 --> 42:43.936
I'm sorry?

42:44.020 --> 42:48.107
With all due respect...
that's just bullshit.

42:48.191 --> 42:49.859
Standing around there
talking about faith

42:49.942 --> 42:52.695
when people are being
blasted to shit left and right.

42:52.778 --> 42:54.947
-That's fucking ridiculous.
-[man] Hey, man...

42:55.031 --> 42:59.118
If there is a God,
he doesn't give a shit
about any of us!

42:59.202 --> 43:02.955
-That's not true.
-Oh, my God,
we're all dying in here.

43:03.039 --> 43:07.877
This shit's not gonna end
until this motherfucker
gets all of us, okay?

43:07.960 --> 43:11.256
So you wanna have faith
in something?
Have faith in this!

43:11.339 --> 43:13.508
Okay? Because that's God
in here now, right?

43:13.591 --> 43:15.593
That's God, right now, in here.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.221
So pray to him
or ask him, even better.

43:18.304 --> 43:20.473
I mean, what does
thou sayeth, God?

43:20.557 --> 43:23.184
Who among us will get to go
to your divine kingdom?

43:23.268 --> 43:26.354
-Hey, take it easy.
-[atheist] Or what?

43:26.438 --> 43:28.606
You gonna fucking kill me
'cause I have an opinion?

43:28.689 --> 43:30.816
Just as valid as yours, man.

43:31.609 --> 43:35.029
Looking around this room,
actually, I think I might
have some friends.

43:35.113 --> 43:37.240
I think people agree with me.

43:38.157 --> 43:42.120
[husband] 95 percent of people
believe in God.
You're in the minority.

43:42.203 --> 43:45.540
Yeah, well,
95 percent of people are idiots.

43:46.207 --> 43:48.501
Are you calling us idiots?

43:48.585 --> 43:50.336
[intense drumbeat]

43:51.963 --> 43:55.007
I'm not calling anybody idiots,
all right?
All I'm saying is this.

43:55.091 --> 43:58.761
If there is a God,
is this something... Does this
seem like he would allow this?

43:58.844 --> 44:00.597
Is this something he would do?

44:02.640 --> 44:05.351
You fuckers are gonna kill me
because you're afraid I'm right?

44:05.435 --> 44:07.353
What are you doing?
You're fucking cowards, huh?

44:07.437 --> 44:11.149
Wait, please. I didn't
even say anything wrong.

44:11.232 --> 44:13.276
-He did.
-Who the fuck is this?

44:13.359 --> 44:15.278
[machine fires, body falling]

44:38.926 --> 44:41.971
[one-armed man]
Looks like God
just cut you a break.

44:42.054 --> 44:45.433
[Bruce]
Yeah, for another
two fucking minutes.

44:50.813 --> 44:53.650
Guys, I know this girl.
Don't I know you?

44:53.774 --> 44:56.235
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I know you from somewhere.

44:56.319 --> 44:58.613
-Me?
-Yeah. Are you an actress?

44:58.695 --> 45:00.156
You're so familiar.

45:00.239 --> 45:02.741
No, I'm not an actress.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.827
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Stacy something.

45:05.786 --> 45:08.498
-No, Christina.
-Christina...

45:08.581 --> 45:10.583
-Christina?
-Yeah.

45:13.169 --> 45:15.630
Wait a minute.
Is Stacy your stage name, then?

45:18.090 --> 45:20.717
No, I told you,
I'm not an actress.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.180
That's what it is, right.

45:24.263 --> 45:27.350
Guys, actress, porn star.
I get it now.

45:27.433 --> 45:29.686
It's a huge difference.

45:29.768 --> 45:31.312
What? I'm not a porn star.

45:31.396 --> 45:34.315
Hey, I don't think anybody cares
around... around here, you know?

45:34.399 --> 45:38.361
I mean, I just couldn't
figure it out before.
Now I know.

45:40.238 --> 45:44.741
-What?
-[exhales] I'm a huge fan.

45:45.535 --> 45:48.454
What the fuck are you doing?
I don't do porn.

45:48.538 --> 45:50.956
I don't think it's a problem.
Everybody's gotta make a living.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.502
-I don't have a problem with it.
-I don't do porn.

45:54.586 --> 45:58.339
All right, whatever.
I'm just trying to pay her
a compliment.

45:58.423 --> 46:00.425
He's lying.

46:01.467 --> 46:03.261
I gotta be honest with you,
you know, I mean,

46:03.344 --> 46:06.514
I did like you better, though,
before your enhancements,

46:06.598 --> 46:10.767
because now it's just like,
"Wha-bam! Look at
these bad boys."

46:12.103 --> 46:14.439
-He's lying.
-[atheist] Are they real?

46:14.522 --> 46:17.942
-That is none of
your fucking business.
-Are you saying they're real?

46:18.025 --> 46:20.819
So what? Half the girls
in LA have big boobs.

46:20.903 --> 46:22.614
Yeah, and I'm sure
it's great for business.

46:22.697 --> 46:25.491
-I don't do porn!
-Who paid for them?

46:25.575 --> 46:27.535
Tell them, go ahead.

46:27.619 --> 46:30.829
It's okay, sweetheart.
Who paid for them?
Was it your employer?

46:30.913 --> 46:32.831
-No.
-No?

46:32.915 --> 46:34.166
-I mean, he did.
-He did?

46:34.250 --> 46:35.251
But it's not like that.

46:35.334 --> 46:37.878
Now it's getting
really difficult to decide.

46:37.962 --> 46:41.215
No, David is my boss,
but we're also...

46:42.467 --> 46:45.052
-I am not...
-Uh-huh.

46:45.136 --> 46:48.973
You see, Stacy over here thought
if she gets those double Ds,

46:49.056 --> 46:50.725
David's gonna love her.

46:50.807 --> 46:53.269
I mean, he's gonna love her way
more than his own wife and kids.

46:53.352 --> 46:55.854
I mean, who cares
if they're already a family?

46:55.938 --> 46:58.149
It's never stopped you before,
has it?

46:58.232 --> 46:59.984
What, are you gonna
run off with him?

47:00.067 --> 47:02.445
Gonna have a bunch of kids
on your own?

47:02.528 --> 47:04.113
Settle down by the beach?

47:04.196 --> 47:06.240
Is that what
you're gonna do, Stacy?

47:06.324 --> 47:08.075
[crying]

47:08.159 --> 47:10.244
[intense drumbeat]

47:19.796 --> 47:21.798
[machine fires, body falling]

47:32.308 --> 47:38.606
[man] I think we should
take into account
if people have families.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.651
Children.

47:41.734 --> 47:43.736
[Asian kid] Why?
How many kids do you have?

47:45.404 --> 47:47.490
I have seven.

47:47.573 --> 47:49.408
-Of course you do.
-Yeah, I got 12.

47:49.492 --> 47:52.869
-Yeah, I got 27.
-Now, now, come on, seriously.

47:52.953 --> 47:55.164
Shouldn't that be taken
into consideration?

47:55.247 --> 48:00.169
-Yeah. Yeah, we have a daughter.
-Yeah. Emily.

48:01.295 --> 48:04.215
-She's three.
-We all got families.

48:04.298 --> 48:05.924
Your kids ain't gonna
save you in here.

48:06.008 --> 48:10.012
Hey, and I'm not asking
to be saved.
I... I'm just saying...

48:12.014 --> 48:14.517
if you don't have children,

48:14.600 --> 48:18.688
maybe you should volunteer.
I think that's reasonable.

48:18.771 --> 48:21.399
Yeah, well, maybe some of us
wanna have kids someday.

48:21.482 --> 48:23.442
Yeah, well, I still am a kid.

48:23.526 --> 48:24.569
Yeah, me too.

48:24.652 --> 48:27.988
And I think
that if you don't have children,

48:28.072 --> 48:31.659
you should do the right thing
and step forward.

48:35.538 --> 48:37.164
How old are you?

48:37.248 --> 48:41.544
What, me? 35. But I have a kid.

48:41.627 --> 48:44.463
-Just one child?
-Yeah, a daughter.

48:44.547 --> 48:47.216
-You married?
-Yes.

48:47.299 --> 48:50.386
-What does your husband do?
-I don't...

48:51.136 --> 48:52.597
You don't what?

48:52.680 --> 48:55.974
Why the sudden interest in me?

48:56.058 --> 48:59.687
We're all just being honest.
I just thought
I'd ask you a question.

48:59.771 --> 49:02.774
Well, I'm not on trial,
so how about
you tell us about your life?

49:02.857 --> 49:04.776
-[intense drumbeat]
-Easy. 41.

49:04.859 --> 49:08.696
I've got two boys,
an 18-month-old baby daughter.

49:08.780 --> 49:12.283
Been married to
the same amazing woman
for 12 years. Erm...

49:12.366 --> 49:14.118
That's it. Your turn.

49:20.291 --> 49:21.459
Shit.

49:24.128 --> 49:25.379
Still waiting.

49:27.172 --> 49:29.550
I raised my
four younger siblings

49:29.634 --> 49:32.804
during my father's
heroin addiction and mother's
clinical depression,

49:32.887 --> 49:36.348
then attended Vassar
under a work/study scholarship

49:36.432 --> 49:39.017
before serving
in the Peace Corps
for three years in Nepal

49:39.101 --> 49:43.147
and then returned to the US
where I've worked
for a non-profit ever since.

49:43.230 --> 49:46.024
Okay, but you still
haven't answered
my question.

49:47.067 --> 49:50.947
-What does your husband do?
-I have a wife.

49:52.615 --> 49:56.869
Oh! So you're a lesbian.

49:56.953 --> 49:59.121
Yeah. So what?
Doesn't make any difference.

49:59.204 --> 50:01.499
That's not necessarily true.

50:01.582 --> 50:04.669
So she's gay. Big deal.
What's the matter?

50:04.752 --> 50:07.254
You think it's okay for a child
to be raised with two gay moms?

50:07.338 --> 50:09.340
It's not fucking 1950, dude.

50:09.423 --> 50:12.176
Yeah, seriously,
mind your own business.

50:12.259 --> 50:15.638
What, you think it's okay
to raise a baby girl
in that environment?

50:15.721 --> 50:18.474
Two gay moms
having sex all over the place?

50:18.557 --> 50:22.186
It's not as bad as two men,
but it's still wrong.

50:23.646 --> 50:26.816
Maybe it's a good thing
that you're here.

50:26.899 --> 50:29.694
You're gonna give
that little girl a chance
to have a normal life.

50:29.777 --> 50:32.321
Whoa, come on, man.
Where are you going with this?

50:32.404 --> 50:35.449
-I'm not homophobic
or anything...
-[woman] Yeah, right.

50:36.868 --> 50:40.078
Do you think that
this is someone
worth dying for?

50:41.121 --> 50:43.332
I know a lot of you
are religious.

50:43.415 --> 50:47.753
This country was based
on family values.

50:47.837 --> 50:51.173
-This is a woman who has sinned.
-[scoffs]

50:52.591 --> 50:54.552
Doesn't that mean something?

50:54.635 --> 50:57.763
-We've all sinned.
-Yes, but some more than others.

50:58.514 --> 51:00.850
I mean, maybe
that's the whole point
of this thing.

51:00.933 --> 51:06.438
Maybe if we figure out
who the sinner is amongst us

51:06.522 --> 51:08.607
that maybe
this whole thing will end.

51:08.691 --> 51:11.736
I mean, we have no idea
what these aliens want.

51:11.819 --> 51:13.905
I mean, maybe that's the answer.

51:13.988 --> 51:17.408
So aliens want me to die
because I'm gay?

51:17.491 --> 51:21.787
Look, nothing personal.
I'm just trying
to get this to stop.

51:25.624 --> 51:29.045
-You think I'm the only one?
-[intense drumbeat]

51:38.303 --> 51:40.598
Cowards.

51:50.775 --> 51:52.777
My son's gay.

51:54.528 --> 51:56.822
And there's not a damn thing
wrong with him.

51:57.698 --> 52:00.534
-[husband] What if
he had a point?
-Just drop it already.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.536
No, no, not about the gay stuff.

52:02.620 --> 52:08.709
I mean, what if one of us dies,
the one they want,
and this all ends?

52:09.710 --> 52:11.712
Jesus. We just keep
going in circles.

52:11.796 --> 52:13.380
Why would they
single one of us out?

52:13.464 --> 52:15.049
[bearded man] We have a problem.

52:15.967 --> 52:18.134
What?

52:18.218 --> 52:22.180
Well, this guy said that
one of us might make it
out of here alive, right?

52:22.932 --> 52:26.602
-Yeah.
-Because we can't
vote for ourselves.

52:26.685 --> 52:28.395
Right.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.146
Well, I'd like to know
what's gonna happen

52:30.230 --> 52:32.900
when there's
only two people left.

52:33.734 --> 52:35.360
What do you mean?

52:35.444 --> 52:39.155
If there's only two people left,
you can only vote
for the other person.

52:43.201 --> 52:45.621
-Shit, they would tie.
-And they would both die.

52:45.704 --> 52:51.002
No. No, no, no. Not necessarily.
One person doesn't have to vote.

52:51.085 --> 52:53.504
-What?
-A sacrifice.

52:53.587 --> 52:56.423
-Yes.
-What does that mean?

52:56.507 --> 53:00.970
It means that if it comes down
to one of us and one of them,
we don't vote.

53:01.053 --> 53:04.348
Somebody would have to
sacrifice themself
to save the other.

53:04.431 --> 53:06.684
Yeah, right.
And who would do that?

53:06.767 --> 53:08.686
I would.

53:08.769 --> 53:12.731
-[black man] Sure you would.
-I would. Wouldn't you?

53:13.357 --> 53:15.985
I really don't know
what I would do.

53:16.068 --> 53:17.945
Let's hope it doesn't
come down to you, then.

53:18.029 --> 53:19.655
At least he's being honest.

53:19.738 --> 53:21.657
In here the truth
gets you killed.

53:21.740 --> 53:25.577
In here everything
gets you killed.

53:25.661 --> 53:27.203
We should pick someone
we can trust.

53:27.287 --> 53:29.498
We can't trust anyone in here.
I think we know that by now.

53:29.581 --> 53:31.876
Well, somebody's gonna
have to do it.
We should decide.

53:31.959 --> 53:34.461
We don't have
to decide anything.

53:34.545 --> 53:37.213
Whoever's left in the end
will make that decision.

53:39.257 --> 53:41.259
What if it comes down
to the two of them?

53:41.343 --> 53:44.471
-[intense drumbeat]
-Well, then,
they'll have to decide.

53:45.221 --> 53:47.599
Or we can decide for them.

53:47.892 --> 53:49.935
[intense drumbeat]

53:58.402 --> 54:01.030
You should have never married
that asshole.

54:01.113 --> 54:02.531
I know.

54:04.449 --> 54:05.868
Together?

54:11.623 --> 54:14.210
[bodies falling, child whimpers]

54:14.334 --> 54:15.961
[cancer survivor] What happened?

54:16.795 --> 54:19.173
-[one-armed man] They tied.
-[Asian kid] How romantic.

54:19.255 --> 54:23.677
I thought if no one voted,
it chose randomly.

54:23.761 --> 54:25.137
[one-armed man]
Not in a tie, I guess.

54:25.221 --> 54:29.725
See? They both can't live.
That means
one of them has to go.

54:29.808 --> 54:33.353
-They're not going anywhere.
-[bearded man]
One of them has to die.

54:33.437 --> 54:35.564
You guys want them to decide?

54:35.647 --> 54:39.193
A little kid? That's too much
responsibility for a child.

54:39.275 --> 54:42.863
Yeah, he's right.
We need to be the ones to do it.

54:42.947 --> 54:45.323
-Do what?
-He wants us
to kill one of them.

54:45.407 --> 54:47.826
I'm just saying
we do what needs to be done.

54:47.910 --> 54:50.328
Bullshit! You're just
trying to save
your own fucking ass.

54:50.412 --> 54:53.082
It doesn't save me
any more than it saves you,

54:53.165 --> 54:56.543
but it guarantees that one of us
will make it out of here alive,

54:56.627 --> 54:59.588
otherwise we will all die.

54:59.671 --> 55:01.966
[soldier]
Listen, this is a trick,
all right?

55:02.049 --> 55:04.760
Once he gets one of them
out of the way,
he'll just go after the other.

55:04.843 --> 55:05.970
Don't fall for his bullshit.

55:06.053 --> 55:11.349
If we had to choose
one of 'em...
who would it be?

55:15.604 --> 55:17.064
What do you do?

55:18.983 --> 55:20.442
-What?
-[one-armed man] Come on, man.

55:20.525 --> 55:22.527
Hey, it's a fair question.

55:23.988 --> 55:26.657
-What do you mean,
like for work?
-Yeah.

55:26.740 --> 55:29.618
Of course it'd be the guy
in the sweater vest
to start this class bullshit.

55:29.701 --> 55:35.249
Hey, hey, hey,
we're trying to decide
who deserves to live, right?

55:35.331 --> 55:37.126
And career choice
is the way to do that.

55:37.209 --> 55:43.381
I'm just saying that some people
contribute more to society
than others.

55:43.465 --> 55:47.011
Who cares what she does?
She's pregnant,
that's what matters.

55:47.094 --> 55:51.431
There are plenty of babies.
I mean,
people have lots of babies.

55:51.515 --> 55:55.060
The world has enough
single moms on welfare.

55:55.144 --> 55:57.437
-She might be unemployed.
-So what?

55:57.521 --> 55:59.023
That doesn't matter.

55:59.982 --> 56:02.234
What does your husband do?

56:02.318 --> 56:04.528
-What?
-The daddy. The baby daddy.

56:04.611 --> 56:06.030
What does he do?

56:07.405 --> 56:09.200
Do you even know
who the father is?

56:09.283 --> 56:12.786
-Yes, I know who the father is.
-Yeah, but you
aren't married, huh?

56:15.497 --> 56:17.041
Look, he's... We're waiting.

56:17.124 --> 56:19.001
Waiting for what?
For him to get out of prison?

56:19.084 --> 56:21.795
-Oh, come on.
-He's not in jail.

56:21.879 --> 56:24.131
[intense drumbeat]

56:24.215 --> 56:27.801
Okay, so what does he do
for a living, then?

56:27.885 --> 56:30.054
Enough with the inquisition.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.563
What do you do?

56:40.981 --> 56:43.775
-I work for a bank.
-[one-armed man] Of course
you do.

56:45.527 --> 56:49.781
We lend people money
to start their own businesses.

56:49.865 --> 56:51.950
Does anybody here
have their own business?

56:52.034 --> 56:55.411
-How much
did you make last year?
-I'm not talking about salaries.

56:55.495 --> 56:57.539
You were the one that started
talking about the jobs.

56:57.622 --> 57:01.252
No, I'm talking about being a
contributing member of society.

57:01.335 --> 57:04.671
Now, I work my ass off
every single day

57:04.755 --> 57:07.716
and I never, never take handouts
from anyone.

57:07.799 --> 57:11.303
I lend people money
to live their dreams.

57:11.387 --> 57:15.599
And outside of work
I contribute a significant
amount of money to charity.

57:15.682 --> 57:18.560
Well, that's easy
when you're
pulling down six figures.

57:18.643 --> 57:21.521
Oh, uh-huh,
and what do you do?

57:22.940 --> 57:25.525
-I'm a graduate student.
-Uh-huh. In?

57:26.777 --> 57:28.153
Psychology.

57:28.237 --> 57:31.407
Well, that's useful.
How about you? What do you do?

57:31.489 --> 57:33.867
-Fuck off, dickhead.
-What do you do?

57:33.951 --> 57:35.452
You collect your
disability checks?

57:35.535 --> 57:39.664
Listen, guy, if you're
trying to get us
to not vote for you,

57:39.748 --> 57:41.499
you're going about it
the wrong way.

57:41.583 --> 57:44.086
-[translator] Seriously.
-[banker] Look, look, look.

57:44.169 --> 57:48.465
We need to come up
with some sort of metric here.

57:48.548 --> 57:51.885
-Some way to decide who lives.
-[whispers in Spanish]

57:51.969 --> 57:56.265
All I know is if one of us
gets to live,
it's gonna be one of those two,

57:56.348 --> 57:58.725
at least if I have anything
to say about it.

57:58.809 --> 58:00.269
[intense drumbeat]

58:00.352 --> 58:02.271
[whispers in Spanish]

58:02.354 --> 58:04.231
[body falling]

58:08.152 --> 58:10.195
[bearded man] Well, I think
we all know what that means.

58:10.279 --> 58:12.781
Yeah, yeah, he's right.
She's gone. He should be next.

58:12.864 --> 58:14.866
How nice. Two for one.

58:14.950 --> 58:17.161
-Seriously.
-I mean, somebody
has to go, right?

58:17.244 --> 58:18.787
Don't you see
what they're doing here?

58:18.870 --> 58:21.415
They just killed her
to get the majority
back in their favor.

58:21.498 --> 58:23.500
-They knew that
she was on our side.
-What side?

58:23.583 --> 58:26.044
-Yeah, there aren't
any sides here.
-Really?

58:26.128 --> 58:27.796
So you've never voted
for the two of them?

58:27.879 --> 58:29.965
-No, of course not.
-Bullshit.

58:30.048 --> 58:32.884
You don't know who's
voting for who in here.
None of us do.

58:32.968 --> 58:34.552
I think we have
a pretty good idea.

58:34.636 --> 58:37.306
People, please, if they get
the majority back on their side,

58:37.389 --> 58:38.474
they will kill both of them.

58:38.556 --> 58:41.059
That's what they want,
to get them out of the way.

58:41.143 --> 58:43.020
Only the rest of us
can stop that from happening.

58:43.103 --> 58:44.355
You're paranoid, man.

58:45.356 --> 58:49.067
Okay, who's with me?
The two girls plus me,
that's... that's three.

58:49.151 --> 58:51.820
There's 16 of us left in here.
We just need six more
to get to nine.

58:51.903 --> 58:53.905
-That's enough.
-Nine what?

58:53.989 --> 58:55.491
-Nine votes for a majority.
-Exactly.

58:55.573 --> 58:56.658
[soldier]
I'm in.

58:56.741 --> 58:58.660
Good, good. Five more.

58:58.743 --> 59:01.413
-Everybody understand?
-This is crazy.
It's not gonna work.

59:01.497 --> 59:03.499
[cancer survivor]
All right, I'm in.

59:04.708 --> 59:07.169
-So am I.
-Okay, that's six.
We need three more.

59:07.252 --> 59:09.505
What about you guys?

59:09.587 --> 59:11.173
What exactly are you
asking us to do?

59:11.256 --> 59:13.509
-We're asking you to help us.
-Yeah, but how?

59:13.591 --> 59:17.221
Look, they are gonna vote
for one of those two girls
each and every time.

59:17.304 --> 59:19.597
Eventually they're gonna get
what they want.

59:19.681 --> 59:22.059
-[soldier] Unless we stop them.
-Stop them how?

59:22.142 --> 59:24.395
-By block voting.
-Yeah, man,
it's just playing defense.

59:24.478 --> 59:26.980
-He's right,
there's no other way.
-It's just a numbers game now.

59:27.064 --> 59:28.732
This is ridiculous!

59:28.815 --> 59:30.526
Are you with me?

59:31.902 --> 59:34.446
-[intense drumbeat]
-What do we do?

59:34.530 --> 59:37.491
No one's voting
for them this round, okay?

59:37.574 --> 59:39.701
Yeah, we said the guy
who doesn't speak any English.

59:39.784 --> 59:44.415
He can't help us now,
so once he's gone, we can
all discuss what to do next.

59:46.291 --> 59:49.086
[bearded man] You all know
what needs to be done!

59:49.169 --> 59:50.170
[child cries]

59:50.254 --> 59:54.174
[banker] Vote for the kid.
It's the only chance
that we have!

01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:03.141
[screams]

01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:05.227
Goddamn it!

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:08.021
You're fucking pathetic, man.
You'd kill a kid
to save your own life.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:09.940
That's right,
I wanna live, just like you.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:11.983
No, not just like me.
I wouldn't do that.

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:15.529
Oh, yeah, well, we'll see
what you do when
it's your ass on the line.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.114
No, I don't think you will.

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:22.369
What's that supposed
to mean, huh?
What, you're gonna kill me now?

01:00:22.453 --> 01:00:24.496
Why? Because I wanna live, huh?

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:28.666
I'm a fucking bad person
because I don't wanna
fucking die in here?

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:32.296
Well, you know what? Fine.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:35.799
You wanna play games?
I'll play your game.

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:40.596
I say we get rid of
both of them right now,
starting with the kid.

01:00:40.678 --> 01:00:44.266
That gives us all a chance
to walk out of here alive.

01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:49.646
Now, I know I'm not the only one
in here that wants to do that.

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:51.106
He's right.
There's 15 of us left.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:53.609
All we need is six
to even the playing field.

01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:55.277
-This isn't a game.
-No, it's not.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.488
But you decided
to make it a game
when you chose sides.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:01.699
Well, we chose.
We just chose the side that said
everyone in here is equal.

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:05.162
No one's special.
You of all people
should understand that.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:09.583
-Hey, you.
Don't you love your wife?
-Of course I do.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.586
Well, don't you want to give her
a chance to get out of here?

01:01:13.878 --> 01:01:16.047
How's that gonna happen
if you're on their side?

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:17.174
[bearded man] Listen to him.

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:20.469
If you choose their side,
you're just sentencing
your wife to death.

01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:22.846
Our way will give her
a chance to live.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:25.140
-Right.
-I...

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:26.850
-Yeah, yeah, but...
-But nothing!

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:29.978
Do you wanna save her or not?

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:32.523
Okay, okay, fine! We're in!

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:34.858
-Me too.
-What?

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:36.693
We're all equal. He's right.

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:39.404
-What?
-Okay. That's... That's five.

01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:42.574
-We just need three more.
-[intense drumbeat]

01:01:42.658 --> 01:01:45.952
-Everybody vote for the kid.
-[soldier] We're voting for you.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.788
[banker] Come on, people.
Don't you wanna live?

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:54.127
[screams]

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:56.754
All right, make them tie again.
They'll both die. That's fair.

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:58.965
-What?
-He's right.
We'll take that trade.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:02.469
-What are you doing?
-[soldier] Don't do it.
She's a kid!

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:09.434
[child cries]

01:02:09.518 --> 01:02:12.229
[black man]
Fuck. What just happened?

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:13.689
[one-armed man]
You lost, assholes.

01:02:13.771 --> 01:02:15.857
[black man] Fuck you.
Why didn't they tie?

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.694
[husband] Why did they tie
the first time
and not the second?

01:02:18.776 --> 01:02:20.445
[bearded man]
Somebody changed their vote.

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:22.113
[husband] Who?

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:25.075
Why don't you ask your wife?

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:31.540
-It was you?
-No.

01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:34.167
I mean, yes, but...

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:36.169
[bearded man] Why'd you switch?

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:40.215
I didn't. I just didn't vote
the second time.

01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:43.427
I couldn't. I'm sorry.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:45.303
[soldier] Right,
because you're a good person.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:46.930
[husband]
Hey, stay out of this, okay?

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:50.767
Look, listen, lady,
nobody said this was
going to be easy,

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.477
but it needs to be done.

01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:55.813
Yeah, listen,
they both can't live anyway.

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:59.776
He's right. One of them is
going to have to die eventually.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:02.904
We need to band together,
otherwise they're gonna win.

01:03:02.987 --> 01:03:09.202
There's no winning here, man.
We all lose, okay?
And that's fine.

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:11.747
We've had plenty of time
to accept that.

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:14.416
There's only one thing left
that we can do,

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:16.460
and that's go out of here
with some dignity.

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:19.463
And maybe we can save two people
instead of one.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.049
[husband]
He's not talking about her.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:26.844
He's talking about getting R-I-D
of the K-I-D
sooner rather than later.

01:03:26.928 --> 01:03:29.514
-[man] Think she can spell.
-We just need
to get this over with.

01:03:29.598 --> 01:03:32.100
Rip the Band-Aid off.
Why drag it out?

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:36.772
-You're outnumbered, man.
-That's right. It's over.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:41.652
Okay.

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:45.405
You wanna live, right?

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:46.906
Yeah.

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:51.869
-But I don't...
-Wanna kill a little kid.
It's okay.

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:56.166
Fine, everybody vote
for the guy with one arm.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:58.460
-Oh, please, man.
-No, no, no, listen, listen.

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:00.837
If we get rid of him,
it'll even things out

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.381
and we'll actually have
more time
to talk about this.

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:04.966
There's nothing left
to talk about.

01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:07.427
Listen, you're just trying
to buy yourself more time.

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:09.971
I'm trying to buy
everybody some time.

01:04:10.888 --> 01:04:12.849
[intense drumbeat]

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.532
All right, what the hell
just happened?

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:29.616
What does that mean?

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.118
It means
the tables have turned, bitch.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:35.038
[bearded man]
People are starting
to see things clearly.

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:37.749
[soldier] Who did that?

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:41.545
GI Joe next.
He's the leader of the pack.

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:45.006
Kill him first,
the rest'll cave.

01:04:45.089 --> 01:04:48.802
Great idea.
There's only 13 of us left.
We only need seven.

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:52.430
[cancer survivor] What do we do?

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:56.351
[black man]
There's nothing you can do.
We've got the majority now.

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:01.898
Let's vote for her.

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:06.695
-What?
-He wants to protect her?

01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:10.073
-Let's put him to the test.
-Hey, hey, hey.
Wait a minute, okay?

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:13.660
-Everybody do it. He'll switch.
-No, wait. Give me a second.

01:05:13.744 --> 01:05:15.746
-Be reasonable, man.
-I am being reasonable.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:17.706
-You wanna give your wife
a chance?
-Yeah.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.374
Then do the right thing.

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:21.585
-Otherwise she's got
30 seconds to live.
-No!

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:23.420
[bearded man]
There's no right thing in here.

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:25.296
Yes, there is. We all know it.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:28.800
Listen, you kill me,
you'll die and she'll die next.

01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:30.677
We all know that.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:34.222
-Come on.
-Do you love your wife or not?

01:05:39.143 --> 01:05:41.145
Come on, please!

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:45.275
Fuck, okay, yes, I'll switch!
Fucking pick somebody else!

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.485
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Everybody vote
for the black guy.

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:50.572
-[intense drumbeat]
-Wait, what? Fuck y'all, man!

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:08.506
Of course.
True love conquers all.

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:10.007
[soldier] You're out of options,
my friend.

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:13.386
[bearded man] Yeah? Well,
you all just killed yourselves.
Congratulations.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.847
You, you, you. You all did this.

01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:19.476
And you...
You just killed your wife.

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:22.145
-I hope you're happy.
-I did what I had to do.

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:24.188
Yeah, well, now she's gonna die
because of you.

01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:26.399
At least my way
gave her a chance.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.653
-Just shut the fuck up, man.
-[husband] Yeah, man,
just drop it.

01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:35.450
-They're probably
not even married.
-What?

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:39.537
I mean, think about it.

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:42.290
What are the odds of them
being the only
married couple in here?

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:44.083
Those other two knew each other.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.085
-So they said.
-That's not gonna work, dude.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.087
So you're saying
that they're married

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.882
and they just happen
to be placed
right next to each other?

01:06:50.966 --> 01:06:54.678
Uh-uh. Think about it, people.

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:58.014
Isn't it possible that they just
made this whole thing up?

01:06:58.097 --> 01:06:59.641
-No.
-[Christina] Why would they lie?

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:03.019
To survive. Nobody wants to kill
someone's wife or husband.

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:04.938
Especially right in
front of each other.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:09.776
They just made this
whole thing up
to get our sympathy.

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:12.111
-You're crazy.
-Am I?

01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:14.823
How long have you been married?

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:20.328
-Five years.
-What's his parents' names?

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:24.248
-Erm... Mark and Lisa.
-Where'd she go to college?

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:25.709
UCLA.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:27.669
When's his birthday?

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:30.881
-Er... April.
-[bearded man] April...

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:32.924
9th. April 9th.

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:36.219
What's his name?

01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:40.015
What?

01:07:40.097 --> 01:07:43.894
What is your husband's name?

01:07:48.023 --> 01:07:50.525
-He already said his name.
-[bearded man] That's right,
he did.

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:54.905
-When?
-The first time he spoke.

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:57.281
He said his name.

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:02.078
Just drop it, man, okay?

01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:06.416
What's his name?

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:14.966
-[Christina] She doesn't know.
-[bearded man]
Of course she doesn't.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.635
Yes, of course she does.

01:08:17.719 --> 01:08:19.636
She's just not gonna play
your fucking games!

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.430
Let's put 'em in a tie
and see what happens.

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:22.515
[husband] What?

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:26.394
If they're married,
there's no way
they will vote for each other.

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:28.020
[intense drumbeat]

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.818
Okay. We made it up.

01:08:33.902 --> 01:08:35.569
-But it was her fucking idea.
-What?

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:37.154
Yeah, yeah.
I just went along with it.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:39.156
No, he said it first.
I had nothing to do with it.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:43.118
-Come on! She's a liar.
Look at her.
-Please don't kill me.

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:44.662
No, kill this bitch!

01:08:48.165 --> 01:08:49.709
[cries]

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:58.718
-Why are you crying?
-Just shut the fuck up,
all right?

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.470
[bearded man]
You shouldn't have lied to us.

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:01.595
I didn't lie.

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.848
Yes, you did.
You said you were married.

01:09:03.932 --> 01:09:08.770
I am married, just not to him.
And I do have a daughter, Emily.

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.689
I didn't lie about that.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:15.192
[bearded man] How many people
do you think were married,
had husbands, wives kids?

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:17.737
You had no problem
with killing any of them.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:20.197
-[wife] I didn't kill them.
-[bearded man] Yes, you did.

01:09:23.118 --> 01:09:24.828
We all did.

01:09:25.996 --> 01:09:28.538
But, listen, you still
have a chance
to make it out of here.

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:31.626
There's 11 of us left.
We just need six votes.

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:36.380
If you join our side,
I promise I will keep you alive.

01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:38.633
Don't listen to him.
He's just trying to use you.

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:40.384
[bearded man]
Hey, you wanna get out of here?

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:43.386
You wanna go back home
and see your real husband,
see Emily?

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:46.432
Yeah.

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:49.102
Good.

01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:53.773
How about you?
Whose side are you on?

01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:59.195
What, you don't speak?

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.615
Okay, he doesn't wanna tell us
who he's voting for,

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.117
and that's fine,
I understand that.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.327
Nobody wants to make
enemies in here.

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:08.830
I'm gonna go ahead
and say that he's on our side.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:16.546
You have a daughter, don't you?
What's her name?

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:18.422
Chloe.

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:20.842
That's a beautiful name, Chloe.

01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:23.887
-You wanna see her again?
-Obviously.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:26.347
-And your partner?
-Wife.

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.269
-Amelia.
-Chloe and Amelia.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.273
Do you wanna see
both of them again?

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:47.326
-I'm sorry.
-[soldier] Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.746
[bearded man] Hey, that's five.
We just need one more.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:50.955
[intense drumbeat]

01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:53.208
-Come on, people. One more.
-Who are we voting for?

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:56.627
-The army guy.
-No! Pick somebody else.

01:10:56.711 --> 01:10:58.046
-Cancer lady.
-What?

01:10:58.129 --> 01:11:00.798
No, no, no.
All right, you all know
who to vote for.

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:02.926
Shit!

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:04.719
Fuck. All right.

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:06.596
[bearded man] Fuck.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.315
[bodies falling]

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:21.152
Holy shit.

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:34.791
What do we do?

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:38.586
Listen, it's okay. It's okay.

01:11:39.503 --> 01:11:43.007
Okay, there's seven of us left.
All we need is four.

01:11:43.091 --> 01:11:47.095
One, two, three...

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:50.974
Is it a boy or a girl?

01:11:54.185 --> 01:11:55.603
I don't know.

01:11:55.686 --> 01:11:57.688
[bearded man]
Don't you wanna find out?

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:00.942
Yes, of course I do.

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:03.027
All it takes is one vote.

01:12:04.112 --> 01:12:06.239
It's really that simple.
Just once.

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.909
No.

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:12.162
No, don't, please.

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:13.663
Please.

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:17.917
-Please.
-No, no, I won't do it.

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:19.002
I will not do it.

01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:21.671
Well, then,
you're killing your own child.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:24.757
How about you, man?
You wanna live?

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:28.970
You know where I stand.

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:31.681
-What about you?
-Jesus Christ.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:33.766
What do you think?

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.520
Forgive me.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:40.857
No! Don't!

01:12:42.192 --> 01:12:45.653
Yes! Jesus Christ.
Thank you, Jesus.

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:48.239
That... Okay, so it's...
There's three to three.

01:12:48.323 --> 01:12:51.242
There's no way
you can protect them now.

01:12:52.576 --> 01:12:54.996
Yeah? Okay, well,
we'll see about that.

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:58.291
You realize
that it's you or them, right?

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:04.088
-So be it.
-You're volunteering?

01:13:05.589 --> 01:13:07.591
If I go, you go.

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:11.470
Okay. How about this?
I'll make you a deal.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:14.182
You give me one of them
and I'll give you her.

01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:16.226
-What?
-[bearded man] We'll trade.

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:26.861
Which one do you want?

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:28.654
Either one.
Doesn't matter to me.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.907
[pregnant woman] What?
What are you doing?

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.743
Okay, deal. Deal.

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:35.912
You get the little girl,
I get the phony wife.

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:38.539
The three of us will
vote for her, the three of you
will vote for her.

01:13:38.622 --> 01:13:40.708
-How do I know I can trust you?
-No.

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:43.294
We'll... We'll vote in order.

01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:45.421
One, two, three.

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:49.550
-Okay, deal.
-Wait a second.

01:13:49.633 --> 01:13:52.803
It's okay. Listen,
trust me, just...

01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:55.056
Okay, I'll go first.

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:57.767
-There must be trust.
-I don't know about this.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:00.937
It's okay. It's okay.
I got you this far.

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.106
-Okay.
-Let's do it.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.150
Okay.

01:14:06.234 --> 01:14:08.236
-What are you doing?
-Just do it.

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:11.781
No, no.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:17.620
[bearded man] Okay, now her.

01:14:22.292 --> 01:14:24.543
[bearded man]
Okay, it's your turn. Go.

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:26.629
[bearded man]
Hey, go. It's your turn.

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:28.881
-What are you doing?
It's your turn.
-What are you doing?

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.967
-[bearded man]
Come on, man, vote.
-[wife] Hurry!

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.843
-What are you doing?
Vote for the kid.
-Vote!

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:35.596
-Are you nuts? Vote!
-[wife] Vote, please!
Please vote!

01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:38.766
-What's he doing? Vote.
-What are you doing?
Come on, vote.

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:41.018
Please vote! Vote!

01:14:41.102 --> 01:14:42.895
[machine fires]

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:48.901
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't you vote?

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:50.987
[man] Because he doesn't vote.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:54.073
-Never has, not once.
-[bearded man] What?

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:57.952
He's never even said a word,
never voted, and he's
made it all this way.

01:14:58.035 --> 01:14:59.745
Dumb fucking luck.

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:01.164
Maybe.

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:03.458
Maybe not.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:05.584
What?

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:10.214
-Maybe it was no accident.
-What are you talking about?

01:15:10.298 --> 01:15:12.758
I think that there's a reason
why he's still alive.

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:17.138
Yeah, because he's been hiding,
hoping we wouldn't notice him.

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:19.307
Well, guess what, buddy?
Your time's up.

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:21.392
There's nowhere
left for you to hide.

01:15:21.476 --> 01:15:23.311
No. No, I don't think that's it.

01:15:23.394 --> 01:15:24.979
Then what?

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:29.233
Think about it.
He's the only person in here
who has never voted.

01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:32.403
So he's survived this long
just because
he hasn't participated?

01:15:32.487 --> 01:15:34.280
I don't know. Could be.

01:15:34.364 --> 01:15:36.907
That's the answer to all this?

01:15:36.991 --> 01:15:42.788
So... what does...
what does that mean,
that he... he gets to live?

01:15:44.207 --> 01:15:45.958
Maybe.

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:47.877
[bearded man]
Does that make him untouchable?

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.213
There's one way
to know for sure.

01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:51.839
[chime sounds]

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:55.218
[bearded man]
Yeah. Let's see what happens.

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:59.055
If we vote for him,
maybe all this will stop.

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:01.474
[intense drumbeat]

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:02.975
Come on.

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:05.644
Come on.

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:12.402
Wait...

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:25.373
[pregnant woman]
So you made all that up?

01:16:25.456 --> 01:16:30.545
No, no.
He's never voted.
I don't think so.

01:16:30.627 --> 01:16:32.671
At least, that and he's
never said a word.

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:34.757
I mean, not that
I can remember.

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.930
I don't think
he wants to give them anything.

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:44.392
We've already given them enough.

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:51.482
Do you want us to vote for you?

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:57.988
He knows we don't have a choice.

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:04.870
[intense drumbeat]

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:18.134
[machine fires, body falling]

01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:19.469
[girl cries]

01:17:19.676 --> 01:17:20.677
[sighs]

01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:26.517
Why are they doing this to us?

01:17:28.352 --> 01:17:31.105
It's some kind
of experiment, I guess.

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:35.067
[pregnant woman] And that's it?

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:39.989
Yeah, maybe. I mean,
maybe they just wanted
to learn about us.

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:41.491
Learn what?

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:44.243
I don't know.

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:48.956
Maybe just to see
what we would do

01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:52.042
and who we would choose and why.

01:17:52.126 --> 01:17:53.877
For what?

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:58.299
To understand us,
what we value, what we don't,
what matters to us.

01:17:58.382 --> 01:18:00.759
By making us kill each other.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.679
When we kill someone,
we're judging them

01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:05.973
and we're saying
that there's something
wrong with them.

01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:08.476
I think that's what
they've been looking for.

01:18:11.895 --> 01:18:13.897
[pregnant woman]
So what do we do now?

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.652
That's up to the two of you.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:25.368
-But how do we choose?
-I don't know.

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:28.371
But once I'm gone, one of you
is gonna have to step forward,

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:30.289
otherwise you'll both die.

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:35.878
But you're gonna have
to decide for yourselves.
I can't do it for you.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.222
You don't have much time.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.483
I'll go.

01:18:57.567 --> 01:19:00.152
[both cry]

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:02.738
-For the baby, right?
-Uh-huh.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:07.410
It's very brave of you.

01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:09.620
What's your name?

01:19:09.704 --> 01:19:15.042
-Katie.
-Okay, Katie,
we'll go together, okay?

01:19:16.793 --> 01:19:19.838
Okay. Okay.

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:21.924
It has to end this way.

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:26.887
[intense drumbeat]

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:31.850
There's no more time. Do it!

01:19:38.566 --> 01:19:40.859
[machine fires, bodies falling]

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:56.626
[sighs]

01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:08.679
Fuck. Come on.

01:20:10.431 --> 01:20:12.266
[intense drumbeat]

01:20:16.019 --> 01:20:17.438
Of course.

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:22.401
Of course. All that...

01:20:22.485 --> 01:20:24.069
All that for nothing.

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:27.364
All that.
What's the matter, huh?

01:20:27.448 --> 01:20:30.409
What, I'm not
good enough for you?

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:33.704
What? I'm not
the one that you wanted?

01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:38.334
I'm exactly the same
as everybody else in here.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.336
They all got to
make their own choices.

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:42.505
They chose to kill each other.

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:45.257
That's what you
wanted to see, right? Huh?

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:49.470
Well, there you go,
congratulations. We're assholes.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:54.684
Fuck you.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.377
[heartbeat]

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:37.434
[machine fires]

01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:41.938
[gasps]

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.385
[man] We all know that
we can't vote
for ourselves, right?

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:17.892
Well, what do you think happens

01:22:17.974 --> 01:22:20.018
when we get down
to the last person left?

01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:24.481
It's a game.
It's process of elimination.

01:22:24.565 --> 01:22:26.817
The last man standing
gets to walk out of here alive.

01:22:33.824 --> 01:22:36.118
Between the kid
and the pregnant girl,

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:39.789
I'm sure it's most likely gonna
come down to
one of them in the end.

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:45.127
You're gonna have to decide
for yourselves.
I can't do it for you.

01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:49.673
It has to end this way.

01:22:51.341 --> 01:22:53.009
You don't have much time.
