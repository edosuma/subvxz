00:02.002 --> 00:04.305
>> PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER":
>> THE HOW WAS TARGETING CODY.

00:04.338 --> 00:07.141
>> IT'S CAREER I'M GETTING
BACKDOORED.

00:07.175 --> 00:20.988
I'D RATHER DIE ON MY FEET THAN
LIVE ON MY KNEES.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.991
TOOK $5,000 FROM ALEX DURING THE
VETO COMPETITION...

00:24.024 --> 00:27.728
>> I REALLY WANT THE $5,000.

00:27.761 --> 00:33.834
>> Announcer: ...THE QEEP OF
PETTY WANTED HER GONE INSTEAD.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.002
AT THE VETO MEETING...

00:35.035 --> 00:38.206
>> I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO ON YOU.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.208
>> EXTREME!

00:40.241 --> 00:42.976
>> Announcer: ...ALEX DECIDED
TO STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL PLAN.

00:43.010 --> 00:44.912
>> I'M SORRY, CODY.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.547
I NOMINATE YOU.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.781
I WASH MY HAPPENS OF THIS.

00:47.815 --> 00:51.119
>> Announcer: BEFORE THE LIVE
EVICTION, JULIE DROPPED A BOMB.

00:51.152 --> 00:55.055
>> Julie: YOU HAVE FINALLY
ARRIVED AT DOUBLE-EVICTION

00:55.089 --> 00:56.124
NIGHT.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.558
>> Announcer: AND THE MARINE
BECAME THE FIRST PLAYER

00:57.591 --> 00:58.759
DISCHARGED TO THE JURY HOUSE.

00:58.792 --> 01:04.798

CODY, YOU ARE EVICTED FROM THE

01:04.832 --> 01:06.267
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.670
>> Announcer: WITH THE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD BACK UP FOR GRABS, THE

01:09.703 --> 01:12.072
COWBOY SLID INTO POWER.

01:12.106 --> 01:13.974

JASON!

01:14.007 --> 01:16.043
YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF

01:16.076 --> 01:17.278
HOUSEHOLD!

01:17.311 --> 01:20.414
>> Announcer: AT NOMINATIONS,
JASON THREW MARK UNDER THE BUS.

01:20.448 --> 01:24.352
>> WE PLAYED CHESS, AND YOU
SAID, "IF WE DON'T MAKE A BIG

01:24.385 --> 01:27.521
MOVE NOW, WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
GET HIM OUT."

01:27.555 --> 01:30.124
>> Announcer: AND THEN HE PUT
THE SHOWMANCE UP TOGETHER.

01:30.158 --> 01:32.460
>> I'M GOING TO NOMINATE YOU,
MARK.

01:32.493 --> 01:35.696
ELENA, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
TAKE A SEAT NEXT TO MARK.

01:35.729 --> 01:42.002
>> Announcer: AT A DO-OR-DIE
VETO COMPETITION FOR ELENA,

01:42.035 --> 01:44.071
KENYA BELIEVE, MARK PULLED OFF
THE WIN.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.439
>> Julie: CONGRATULATIONS,
MARK.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.674
YOU HAVE WON THE POWER OF VETO!

01:46.707 --> 01:50.544
>> IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT,
JASON AND HIS ALLIES CONSIDERED

01:50.578 --> 01:55.449
TARGETING MATT.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.419
AT THE VETO MEETING, MARK SAVED
HIMSELF...

01:58.452 --> 02:02.490
>> I'M GOING TO USE THE VETO ON
MYSELF.

02:02.523 --> 02:05.926
>> Announcer: ...AND RAVEN'S
MAIN MAN FILLED HIS SEAT.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.530
>> MATT, IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'LL
PUT YOU RIGHT THERE NEXT TO

02:09.563 --> 02:09.963
ELENA.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.064
>> WELCOME BACK!

02:11.098 --> 02:14.968
>> Announcer: BEFORE THE
EVICTION, JOSH PUT THE TARGET

02:15.002 --> 02:15.603
BACK ON ELENA.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.170
>> ELENA.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.371
>> I THINK SO SO.

02:17.405 --> 02:20.874
>> ELENA, BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP
MARK AND ELENA TOGETHER, WE'RE

02:20.908 --> 02:21.975
SCREWED.

02:22.009 --> 02:22.943
>> Announcer: AND AT THE
SECOND EVICTION OF THE NIGHT,

02:22.976 --> 02:25.646
THE RADIO PERSONALITY'S AIR TIME
WAS CUT SHORT.

02:25.679 --> 02:29.350
>> Julie: BY A VOTE OF 6-1,
ELENA, YOU ARE EVICTED FROM THE

02:29.383 --> 02:31.719
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

02:31.752 --> 02:35.289
>> Announcer: TONIGHT, THE
FALLOUT FROM THE DOUBLE

02:35.323 --> 02:35.589
EVICTION.

02:35.623 --> 02:35.989
PLUS...

02:36.023 --> 02:40.661
>> WHAT'S UP.

02:40.694 --> 02:44.131
>> Announcer: "BIG BROTHER"
LEGEND DERRICK SURPRISEDS THE

02:44.164 --> 02:46.567
HOUSE, AND THE BATTLE FOR HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD BEGINS.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.371
ALL THIS RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

02:50.404 --> 02:53.341
>> BYE!

03:38.218 --> 03:38.852
>> LOVE YOU.

03:38.886 --> 03:39.820
>> LOVE YOU, TOO.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.555
>> BYE, ELENA.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.391
LOVE YOU, ELENA!

03:43.424 --> 03:50.197
LOVE YOU, ELENA!

03:50.230 --> 03:55.469
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M THE REASON
ELENA LEFT TONIGHT.

03:55.503 --> 04:01.008
THE WAY I KIND OF ATTACH MYSELF
TO HER.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.143
ELENA TOLD ME SHE WANTED SPACE.

04:03.176 --> 04:13.921
I DIDN'T GIVE IT TO HER.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.357
AND SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN
IN A BETTER POSITION THIS SUMMER

04:16.390 --> 04:18.492
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME.

04:18.526 --> 04:23.864
AND THAT HURTS.

04:23.897 --> 04:27.535
IT'S ME AGAINST THE WHOLE HOUSE,
100%.

04:27.568 --> 04:34.207
BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET ME
OUT THAT EASILY.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.108
>> WOW.

04:35.142 --> 04:39.547
IT WENT FROM VERY COLORFUL TO
NOT.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.814
>> YUP.

04:40.848 --> 04:44.518
>> YOU COULD TELL HE MADE IT UP
RIGHT THEN BECAUSE HE WAS LIKE,

04:44.552 --> 04:45.853
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.689
>> FINALLY, CODY IT OUT OF THIS
GAME FOR GOOD.

04:48.722 --> 04:52.526
THIS GUY HAS BEEN UNDER MY SKIN
THE ENTIRE SEASON, AND FINALLY

04:52.560 --> 04:54.995
ALL THIS HARD WORK PAID OFF!

04:55.028 --> 04:57.598
AND OH, MY GOD, I SOMEHOW
SURVIVED DOUBLE EVICTION.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.435
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I MADE IT
SO FAR OR WHY THESE PEOPLE ARE

05:01.469 --> 05:05.839
NOT EVEN CONSIDERED PUTTING ME
UP ON THE BLOCK, BUT I'LL TAKE

05:05.873 --> 05:06.840
IT.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.009
>> RIGHT NOW, WE'RE ON THE FIRST
PUZZLE TOGETHER.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.479
WE WERE BOTH FAILING.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.314
>> I'LL NEED LOTS OF HUGS THIS
WEEK, RAVEN.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.483
>> I GOT YOU COVERED.

05:15.516 --> 05:19.152
>> I'D STILL BE DOING MINE, NOT
THE WHOLE THING, THE FIRST

05:19.186 --> 05:20.320
PUZZLE.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.790
EVEN THOUGH THE SHOMANLSES HAVE
BEEN TARGETED THE LAST FEW

05:22.823 --> 05:24.692
WEEKS, I'M FEELING CONFIDENT
RIGHT NOW.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.060
BOTH RAVEN AND MYSELF HAVE BUILT
REALLY STRONG RELATIONSHIPS IN

05:27.094 --> 05:29.329
THIS HOUSE, SO I FEEL GREAT
MOVING FORWARD.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.700
>> OH, MY GOD, DOUBLE EVICTIONS
ARE NOT GOOD.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.701
>> THAT WAS NOT FUN.

05:33.734 --> 05:34.902
>> OH, MY GOSH.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.804
OH, MY GOSH.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.306
TONIGHT'S DOUBLE EVICTION COULD
NOT HAVE GONE ANY BETTER.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.341
WE SUBJECT HOME ELENA.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.343
NEXT PERSON GOING HOME IS GOING
TO BE MARK.

05:43.377 --> 05:48.348
AND AFTER THAT, MAD RAVEN, AND
THEN THERE WILL BE NO MORE

05:48.382 --> 05:51.752
SHOWMANCES.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.954
>> I GOT YOU, BIG GUY.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.322
I GOT YOU.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.223
>> NO PROBLEM.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.959
>> DUDE, I CAN'T WAIT TO GET HIM
OUT.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.928
>> ME, NEITHER.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.663
>> I BONED IT UP, I'M SORRY.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.664
>> NO, YOU DIDN'T.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.297
>> YOU DIDN'T.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.500
>> DUDE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

06:06.534 --> 06:08.536
LIKE, COME ON NOW.

06:08.569 --> 06:12.139
WE CAN'T EXPECT YOU TO WIN TWO
THINGS IN ONE, PAL.

06:12.172 --> 06:16.644
THAT'S CRAZY.

06:16.677 --> 06:21.281
>> SO MARK IS CLEARLY FEELING A
LITTLE EMOTIONAL RIGHT NOW, AND

06:21.314 --> 06:23.484
JASON'S SPEECH WAS PRETTY
INTERESTING.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.019
>> ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO
NOMINATE YOU, MARK, AND YOU,

06:26.053 --> 06:27.220
ELENA.

06:27.254 --> 06:30.558
MARK, WE PLAYED CHESS, AND YOU
SAID, "IF WE DON'T MAKE A BIG

06:30.591 --> 06:34.327
MOVE NOW, WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
GET HIM OUT."

06:34.361 --> 06:38.799
>> SO, MARK, WHY DON'T YOU TELL
US ALL WHAT YOUR BIG MOVE WAS,

06:38.832 --> 06:42.536
BECAUSE IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE
YOUR BIG MOVE WAS ME.

06:42.570 --> 06:46.039
>> IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING,
WHO WAS COMING AFTER ME IN

06:46.073 --> 06:48.476
DOUBLE EVICTION.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.711
ME AND JASON HAD THAT
CONVERSATION PLAYING CHESS,

06:50.744 --> 06:51.712
LIKE, TWO WEEKS AGO.

06:51.745 --> 06:55.148
>> AND YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING
TO COME AFTER ME?

06:55.182 --> 06:56.750
>> I WAS GOING TO COME AFTER
YOU?

06:56.784 --> 06:57.718
>> NO, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

06:57.751 --> 07:03.857
>> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

07:03.891 --> 07:04.458
ARE.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.693
>> BUT HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

07:05.726 --> 07:07.928
>> IT HAS TO BE PERFECT TIMING.

07:07.961 --> 07:13.501
BASICALLY, LIKE, THIS HAS TO
STAY BETWEEN ME AND YOU.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.504
>> I HEARD THINGS YOU DIDN'T
FEEL LIKE--

07:16.537 --> 07:17.505
>> WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

07:17.538 --> 07:19.540
>> THAT YOU WERE THROWING MY
NAME OUT THERE, TOO.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.040
>> WHO?

07:20.073 --> 07:20.708
>> OTHER PEOPLE?

07:20.741 --> 07:21.208
>> WHO?

07:21.241 --> 07:22.042
>> I DON'T REMEMBER.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.544
>> YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.812
>> SELECTIVELY.

07:24.845 --> 07:27.915
>> YOU WERE NOT THE ONE WHO SAID
YOU WANTED TO MAKE A BIG MOVE TO

07:27.948 --> 07:28.248
JASON?

07:28.281 --> 07:28.816
>> I DID.

07:28.849 --> 07:29.583
>> AND I'M THE BIG MOVE.

07:29.617 --> 07:30.784
>> YEAH.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.153
>> AND YOU SAY YOU CAN'T TRUST
ME WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE SAYING

07:33.186 --> 07:34.054
LIKE THAT.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.223
>>Y SAID THAT BECAUSE I COULDN'T
TRUST YOU.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.525
>>> WHY NOT?

07:37.558 --> 07:39.660
HOW MANY H.O.H.s HAVE I WON
AND YOU HAVEN'T GONE UP.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.861
>> TWO.

07:40.894 --> 07:44.532
>> YOU HAVEN'T WON ANYTHING AND
YOU'RE TOSSING MY NAME OUT.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.567
WHO IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED HERE.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.267
>> CLEARLY ME.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.702
>> CLEARLY YOU.

07:48.736 --> 07:49.870
LIAR.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.038
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO SAID I
WAS THROWING YOUR NAME OUT?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.305
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE?

07:52.339 --> 07:53.306
WE'RE ALL HERE.

07:53.340 --> 07:57.210
WHY DON'T YOU CALL THEM OUT TO
PROTECT YOURSELF?

07:57.244 --> 08:05.118
>> WHATEVER I SAY IS NOT GOING
TO PROTECT ME.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.186
>> I'M ASKING YOU.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.988
YOU TOLD ME THAT.

08:08.021 --> 08:08.756
SO YOU'RE LYING.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.224
>> I CALLED IT.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.492
>> WHO WAS IT.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.461
>> WHAT WAS I LYING GO ABOUT?

08:14.494 --> 08:17.197
>> OKAY, WHAT DID I DO THAT MADE
YOU NOT TRUST ME?

08:17.230 --> 08:19.399
>> MUST HAVE BEEN JUST PARANOIA.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.235
>> MUST HAVE JUST BEEN PARANOIA.

08:22.269 --> 08:22.936
THANKS, DUDE.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.137
I APPRECIATE YOU HAVING MY BACK.

08:24.171 --> 08:24.972
>> IT'S A GAME.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.006
I MESSED UP.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.375
>> BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ADMIT
HOW YOU MESSED UP.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.477
>> NO, HE JUST WON'T REMEMBER.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.113
>> I HONESTLY FEEL BROKEN.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.583
PAUL CALLS ME OUT AND JASON
WANTS TO DENY IT.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.185
AND IT'S JUST, LIKE, YOU MAKE
MOVES IN THIS GAME, SOMETIMES

08:38.218 --> 08:42.556
YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISKS, PUT YOUR
TRUST IN PEOPLE, AND IT BIT ME

08:42.590 --> 08:44.592
IN THE BUTT.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.003
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO EAT?

08:56.036 --> 08:59.372
ALL WE HAVE IS MACARONI AND
CHEESE AND PASTA.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.708
.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.075
>> OH, MY GOD!

09:02.109 --> 09:02.976
>> WHAT!

09:03.010 --> 09:03.611
>> WHAT!

09:03.644 --> 09:04.612
>> THE FRONT DOOR!

09:04.645 --> 09:05.579
>> OH, MY GOD!

09:05.613 --> 09:07.214
>> OH, MY GOD!

09:07.247 --> 09:08.348
OH, MY GOD!

09:08.381 --> 09:10.884
>> I HEAR THE DOOR BREL RINGING
AND MY HEART JUST DROPS.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.853
>> WHO IS IT?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.121
>> WHO?

09:14.154 --> 09:14.655
ST?

09:14.688 --> 09:15.455
>> IT'S "BIG BROTHER."

09:15.488 --> 09:18.358
SOMETIMES THE DOORBELL RING IS
GOOD.

09:18.391 --> 09:18.959
SOMETIMES IT'S BAD.

09:18.992 --> 09:22.029
>> I'M GOING TO LOSE MY...

09:22.062 --> 09:26.433
>> WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

09:26.466 --> 09:34.775
>> I CAN'T TAKE THIS RIGHT NOW.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.444
I'M ALREADY SHAKING FROM DOUBLE
EVICTION, AND I WASN'T EVEN ON

09:37.477 --> 09:40.848
THE BLOCK, AND NOW DERRICK WALKS
IN WITH A DUFFEL BAG.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.316
>> THAT BAG BETTER BE FULL OF
TREATS, BUDDY.

09:43.350 --> 09:47.520
>> HE WON "B.B. 16."

09:47.554 --> 09:49.056
NEVER WAS PUT ON THE BLOCK.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.158
AND CONTROLLED THE WHOLE HOUSE.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.628
FOR ONCE, MY NAME GAMEIS GOING
GOOD, AND THIS IS THE LAST THING

09:54.662 --> 09:55.562
THEY NEED!

09:55.595 --> 09:57.097
>> I'M THE NEXT TWIST.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.566
>> AAARRRGGHH!

09:59.599 --> 10:00.768
>> NO WAY!

10:00.801 --> 10:03.170
>> DERRICK IS ARGUABLY ONE OF
THE BEST "BIG BROTHER" PLAYERS

10:03.203 --> 10:05.338
AROUND, DEFINITELY DON'T WANT
HIM BACK IN THIS HOUSE.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.774
IS THIS SOME SICK JOKE?

10:06.807 --> 10:08.608
WHY DOES HE HAVE A MOVE-IN BAG.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.476
>> NO WAY!

10:09.509 --> 10:10.778
>> HE'S STAYING!

10:10.811 --> 10:14.314
>> I'M JUST PLAYING WITH YOU
GUYS.

10:14.347 --> 10:18.752
>> LISTEN, LISTEN.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.788
I JUST WANT TO SAY
CONGRATULATIONS FOR GETTING PAST

10:20.821 --> 10:24.825
THE FIRST HALF OF THE SEASON,
AND, ALSO, SURVIVING THE DOUBLE

10:24.858 --> 10:25.993
EVICTION.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.260
THAT'S A BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT, SO
YOU GUYS SHOULD BE PROUD.

10:27.294 --> 10:33.701
IT REALLY IS CRAZY TO BE BACK IN

10:33.734 --> 10:35.468
THE B.B. HOUSE.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.637
YIT'S DIFFERENT, BUT AT THE SAME
TIME IT'S VERY FAMILIAR, AND IT

10:37.671 --> 10:41.108
BRINGS BACK A LOT OF GOOD
MEMORIES I HAD WITH MY SEASON.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.712
WHAT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW,
HONESTLY, HOW IT'S BEEN FOR YOU

10:44.745 --> 10:45.178
GUYS.

10:45.212 --> 10:45.813
>> PRETTY EXTREME.

10:45.846 --> 10:46.513
>> EXTREME!

10:46.546 --> 10:48.348
>> THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FIGHTS.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.249
THERE'S BEEN CRYING.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.584
THERE'S BEEN POTS AND PANS.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.552
STAY AWAY!

10:52.585 --> 10:53.586
STAY AWAY!

10:53.620 --> 10:54.822
MARK, HOW DO YOU FEEL?

10:54.855 --> 10:57.825
>> ME AND JOSH HAVE DEFINITELY
HAD A FEW MOMENTS IN THIS HOUSE,

10:57.858 --> 11:00.660
AND--
>> IT'S ALL FUN.

11:00.694 --> 11:05.098
* *
>> HEY, MEATBALLS!

11:05.132 --> 11:06.299
I WANT TO PLAY!

11:06.333 --> 11:07.534
THIS HOUSE IS CRAZY.

11:07.567 --> 11:11.872
ON ONE SIDE WE GOT CODY, AND ON
THE OTHER END WE HAVE CRYBABY

11:11.905 --> 11:12.639
MARK.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.843
I HAD ENOUGH OF THESE TWO.

11:15.876 --> 11:21.548
I'M CHEF BOY A JOSH, AND I'M
STIRRING THINGS UP.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.583
CODY, WHY ARE YOU CRYING IN THE
CORNER?

11:23.616 --> 11:25.218
YOU'RE 32 YEARS OLD, YOU BIG
BABY.

11:25.252 --> 11:25.552
>> YES!

11:25.585 --> 11:27.054
I LOVE IT!

11:27.087 --> 11:32.893
>> YOU BOUGHT A PERSONALITY OFF
OF AMAZON.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.461
RETURN THAT...

11:34.494 --> 11:38.265
GET YOUR REFUND BECAUSE YOUR
PERSONALITY STILL SUCKS.

11:38.298 --> 11:38.966
WHAT'S UP MARK?

11:38.999 --> 11:40.333
I WANT TO ARGUE NOW.

11:40.367 --> 11:45.739
WHERE ARE MY POTS?

11:45.773 --> 11:55.482
* DA-DA-DA-DA
>> YOU QUIT YOUR JOB FOR THIS?

11:55.515 --> 11:56.449
.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.552
>> MATTE BECAUSE, YOU GUYS WANT
TO PLAY DIRTY?

11:59.586 --> 12:00.954
WELL, WELCOME TO HELL.

12:00.988 --> 12:07.060
* DA-DA-DA-DA
DA-DA-DA*

12:07.094 --> 12:09.830
>> I LIVE IN AN INSANE ASYLUM.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.598
>> YOU MEATBALLS GOTTA GO.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.400
>> SEE, I WAS WAITING FOR THIS.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.434
I SHANE IN THE CHAOS.

12:14.467 --> 12:24.077
>> I LOVE IT
* DA-DA-DA-DA

12:24.111 --> 12:26.279
GUESS WHAT, THERE'S NO SLEEPING
UNTIL YOU LEAVE.

12:26.313 --> 12:30.717
I'M GOING TO TORTURE YOU AND BE
A LIVING NIGHTMARE TILL YOU WALK

12:30.750 --> 12:32.219
OUT THOSE DOORS.

12:32.252 --> 12:36.289
>> NOW IT'S UP, BABY.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.657
>> MATTE BECAUSE!

12:37.690 --> 12:44.231
YOU'RE GOING HOME!

12:44.264 --> 12:47.234
>> BUT IT HASN'T ALL BEEN
FIGHTING POOP.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.301
THERE'S BEEN SOME LOVE, TOO.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.569
>> OH, YEAH, OH, YEAH.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.940
>> I THINK THERE'S ONE SHOWMANCE
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT.

12:52.973 --> 12:56.844
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON JESS AND
CODY?

12:56.877 --> 12:58.411
IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE THERE
FOR EACH OTHER.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.546
>> I'LL SAY SOMETHING.

12:59.579 --> 13:00.881
I THINK HE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER.

13:00.914 --> 13:09.857
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS IN LOVE
WITH HIM.

13:09.890 --> 13:14.862
* *
>> AMERICA'S WAITING.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.668
.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.637
>> CODY AND I HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
SINCE DAY FIVE.

13:24.671 --> 13:25.839
THINGS HAPPENED REALLY QUICKLY.

13:25.873 --> 13:29.142
WE KNOW EACH OTHER SO WELL IN
SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

13:29.176 --> 13:32.279
IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE WE'VE BEEN
DATING FOR A FEW YEARS, AS

13:32.312 --> 13:34.181
OPPOSED TO A FEW WEEKS.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.782
>> I.

13:35.815 --> 13:43.957
LOVE.

13:43.991 --> 13:44.591
JUMBO-SIZED JETS.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.895
>> JUMBO

13:47.928 --> 13:48.161
WEIRDO.

13:48.195 --> 13:52.165
>> I.

13:52.199 --> 13:56.569
LOVE.

13:56.603 --> 13:57.204
JUUUUSTIFYING.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.471
>> CODY, I KNOW YOU LOVE ME.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.773
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.

14:00.807 --> 14:05.312
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT YWHAT I WANT TO HEAR.

14:05.345 --> 14:09.216
>> I'M BEING COERCED UNDER
INTENSE PRESSURE, UNDER THE--

14:09.249 --> 14:10.750
>> OH, YOU HAVE STAGE FRIGHT.

14:10.783 --> 14:15.288
>> UNDER THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE,
I'M FORCED TO SALE JESSICA--

14:15.322 --> 14:21.594
>> DID YOU JUST COUGH?

14:21.628 --> 14:24.231
WHAT WAS THAT?

14:24.264 --> 14:26.366
>> YES, YES, ABSOLUTELY.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.336
I LOVE

14:29.369 --> 14:31.404
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO TO BED.

14:31.438 --> 14:34.942
>> JESSICA HAS ROCKED MY WORLD
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

14:34.975 --> 14:38.611
I'VE NEVER SPENT SO MUCH QUALITY
TIME WITH A GIRL IN MY LIFE,

14:38.645 --> 14:39.279
EVER.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.981
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY REAL LOVE.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.050
I DON'T WANT TO LOVE YOU.

14:43.083 --> 14:48.021
IT'S JUST, LIKE, IT JUST
HAPPENED.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.757
>> CODY AND I LOVE EACH OTHER

14:50.790 --> 14:53.660
VERY MUCH, BUT EVERY
RELATIONSHIP HAS ITS UPS AND

14:53.693 --> 14:54.894
DOWNS.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.297
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE FINDS A
NEW WAY TO TEST US EVERY DAY,

14:57.330 --> 15:00.800
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS SUNNY IN
PARADISE.

15:00.833 --> 15:10.910
>> UM, WAS YOUR ORIGINAL
ALLEGIANCE TO JASON AND ALEX?

15:10.944 --> 15:14.948
SO THAT THEY WOULD BE THE ONES
TO TAKE OUT RAVEN AND I?

15:14.982 --> 15:17.117
>> NEVER.

15:17.150 --> 15:21.754
JESSICA, I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE NEVER HAD AN ALLIANCE

15:21.788 --> 15:22.622
WITH THEM.

15:22.655 --> 15:31.598
ALL I'VE HAD IN THIS GAME IS MY
LOYALTY.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.633
>> WHAT?

15:33.666 --> 15:35.468
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

15:35.502 --> 15:38.505
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:38.538 --> 15:39.772
CODY.

15:39.806 --> 15:44.377
CODY IS A DEFENSIVE PERSON, AND
WHEN I QUESTIONED HIS LOYALTY TO

15:44.411 --> 15:46.379
ME, HE JUST SHUTS DOWN.

15:46.413 --> 15:49.516
WE'VE ALL SAID AND DONE THINGS
THAT WE REGRET AND DON'T STAND

15:49.549 --> 15:50.550
BY ANYMORE.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.253
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET CODY'S
SIDE OF THE STORY.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.487
BABE.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.090
I DON'T LIKE SEEING YOU LIKE
THIS.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.858
COME HERE.

15:58.891 --> 15:59.926
COME HERE.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.895
>> THERE'S NO-- THERE'S NO--
THERE'S NO "BABE" STUFF.

16:02.929 --> 16:03.796
>> STOP THAT.

16:03.830 --> 16:07.500
>> YOU CAN FIND SOMEBODY ELSE TO
DISTRUST.

16:07.534 --> 16:11.004
I DON'T GIVE A...

16:11.038 --> 16:13.506
>> CAN YOU STOP?

16:13.540 --> 16:14.774
THIS GOES BEYOND GAME.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.078
WE HAVE A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP,
AND I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

16:18.111 --> 16:21.114
THAT IS OKAY, FIRST AND
FOREMOST.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.715
LOOK AT ME.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.051
DON'T DO THIS.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.186
TONIGHT ACT LIKE THIS.

16:26.219 --> 16:26.819
PLEASE, DON'T.

16:26.853 --> 16:27.787
>> I CAN ACT LIKE ANYTHING.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.688
>> PLEASE, DON'T.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.357
>> I'M GOING TO GO OUT THERE AND
WORK OUT.

16:30.390 --> 16:34.294
>> YOU CAN PLEASE NOT DO THIS
RIGHT NOW?

16:34.327 --> 16:36.029
CODY, PLEASE DON'T ACT LIKE
THIS.

16:36.063 --> 16:36.629
PLEASE.

16:36.663 --> 16:41.101
>> YOU LOST ME OUT THERE.

16:41.134 --> 16:46.139
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY QUESTIONING
ME.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.740
NEVER QUESTION LIE... LOYALTY.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.242
NEVER.

16:49.276 --> 16:57.350
IT'S ALL I GOT.

16:57.384 --> 17:01.454
>> CODY, WILL YOU PLEASE STOP
IT.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.755
YOU'RE OVER-REACTING.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.591
>> I DON'T CARE HOW I'M ACTING.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.526
>> BABE--
>> I DON'T CARE HOW YOU THINK

17:06.559 --> 17:07.294
I'M ACTING.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.195
>> BABE.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.629
>> I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR
STANDARDSES ARE.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.164
>> STOP.

17:11.198 --> 17:11.464
STOP.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.832
STOP IT!

17:12.865 --> 17:13.833
NO!

17:13.866 --> 17:15.802
>> I DON'T THINK YOU-- YOU
CLEARLY DON'T KNOW ME.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.837
YOU CLEARLY DON'T UNDERSTAND ME.

17:17.870 --> 17:21.408
ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID IN
WEEK ONE IS JUST-- DOESN'T

17:21.441 --> 17:22.809
MATTER AT THIS POINT.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.445
ME AND JESS WEREN'T EVEN
TOGETHER AT WEEK ONE, AND FOR

17:25.478 --> 17:29.382
HER TO BELIEVE THAT I'M TRYING
TO TAKE HER OUT IN THIS GAME,

17:29.416 --> 17:32.485
IT'S SO ABSURD, THAT IT'S
UPSETTING THAT SHE'S QUESTIONING

17:32.519 --> 17:35.555
MY TRUST IN HER AT THIS POINT.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.724
>> STOP IT.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.292
YOU ARE OVER-REACTING.

17:39.326 --> 17:42.462
>> I TRUST JESS 100%.

17:42.495 --> 17:45.432
IF HE DOESN'T TRUST ME, THERE IS
NO RELATIONSHIP.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.167
>> DO WHATEVER THE... YOU WANT.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.902
>> I WILL.

17:49.936 --> 17:55.074
>> CHILD.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.110
GOD, I DIDN'T SIGN UP TO BE A
BABY-SITTER.

18:09.088 --> 18:14.227
DIDN'T FIND LOVE THIS SUMMER IS
MY FRIEND RAMSES.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.063
YOU GUYS THINK HE HAD ANY
CRUSHES?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.332
>> IT WAS MATTHEW TRYING TO TAKE
HIM FROM ME.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.333
COME ON NOW.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.302
>> RAMSES, TELL JESSICA THE KIND
OF MAN YOU WANT.

18:22.335 --> 18:28.074
>> SO I WANT TO GO SHOPPING AT A
MARKS 'R" US.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.243
THE BASE PERSON IS A MARK, AND
YOU CHOOSE FROM THERE.

18:30.277 --> 18:33.580
>> LIKE A POTATO HEAD, ALMOST.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.847
>> EXACTLY.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.417
YOU CAN DEFINITELY TELL THIS IS
THE SUMMER OF TEMPTATION BECAUSE

18:37.450 --> 18:40.320
THE MEN IN THIS HOUSE, DEAR GOD!

18:40.353 --> 18:41.120
THEY ARE FINE.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.289
>> WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE ABOUT
MARK?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.291
>> HE'LL HAVE BLACK HAIR.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.425
I LIKE THE STUBBLE.

18:45.458 --> 18:49.028
AND THEN MAYBE A LITTLE LESS
MUSCLE BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF

18:49.061 --> 18:50.129
INTIMIDATING.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.398
AND THEN I LIKE THE PERSONALITY
AND I LIKE THE VOICE.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.666
AND THEN LET'S DO GREEN EYES.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.067
OH, TATTOO.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.035
I TORGOT TATTOOS.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.937
>> SO YOU WANT PAUL AND MARK
COMBINED.

18:57.970 --> 19:02.675
>> I COULD LITERALLY HAVE MY EYE
TO A MAN IF I TOOK MARK'S

19:02.709 --> 19:07.514
PERSONALITY AND PAUL'S TATTOO
AND BEARD AND PUT THEM TOGETHER.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.616
OH, MY GOD.

19:09.649 --> 19:13.520
I LITERALLY JUST DESCRIBED MATT.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.088
IS MATT MY MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN?

19:16.122 --> 19:17.324
OH, MY GOD!

19:17.357 --> 19:18.591
SHOULD I PURSUE HIM?

19:18.625 --> 19:22.028
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT TO RAVEN.

19:22.061 --> 19:26.499
OR CAN I?

19:26.533 --> 19:39.212
I WAS LIKE, OH, MY GOD!

19:44.717 --> 19:47.186
WILL YOU MASASS HIM?

19:47.220 --> 19:48.855
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS
GOING TO DO.

19:48.888 --> 19:49.889
>> OH, RAMSES.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.691
>> THIS IS LITERALLY THE LIFE
YOU WANT.

19:51.724 --> 19:55.862
>> DUDE, THIS IS GOING TO BE
SAFE LONG SUMMER.

19:55.895 --> 19:56.629
OH!

19:56.663 --> 20:01.501
MATT, IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS
LIKE!

20:01.534 --> 20:07.607
>> OH, I LOVE THIS.

20:07.640 --> 20:11.210
>> I MEAN, THERE'S BEEN
SHOWMANCES, THERE'S BEEN

20:11.244 --> 20:14.213
FIGHTING, BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN
FRIENDSHIPS, RIGHT?

20:14.247 --> 20:15.014
>> FRIENDSHIP!

20:15.047 --> 20:16.215
>> YEAH!

20:16.249 --> 20:18.851
>> I GOTTA ASK ALEX-- DID YOU
REALLY THINK YOU WERE GOING TO

20:18.885 --> 20:21.288
BE FRIEND WITH A RODEO CLOWN?

20:21.321 --> 20:22.855
>> NO.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.223
MY RIDE OR DIE IS JASON.

20:24.257 --> 20:34.301
>> I GUESS SOME FRIENDSHIPS ARE
MEANT TO BE.

20:34.301 --> 20:42.509
>> I GUESS SOME FRIENDSHIPS ARE
MEANT TO BE.

20:42.542 --> 20:46.145
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO A
SHOWMANCE, SO JASON BEING

20:46.178 --> 20:49.516
MARRIED IS PERFECT FOR ME
BECAUSE JASON IS EXACTLY LIKE

20:49.549 --> 20:50.617
ALL MY GUY FRIENDS BACK HOME.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.019
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE A VIDEO
GAMER.

20:53.052 --> 20:58.024
>> I DO GAME YOU'RE SO LAME!

20:58.057 --> 20:59.926
>> DO YOU WANT TO FEED THE
BULLS?

20:59.959 --> 21:01.027
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT LAME.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.730
YOU CAN LITERALLY DIE ANY
SECOND.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.533
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AT A
BLISS-CON.

21:06.566 --> 21:07.700
>> THEY RELEASE GAMES.

21:07.734 --> 21:11.070
>> AND GIVE YOURSELF CARPEL
TUNNEL SYNDROME AND MAKE YOUR

21:11.103 --> 21:12.372
EYES GO CROSS.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.875
>> SOMETIMES I WONDER IF HE'S
FALLEN OFF HIS BULL ONE TOO MANY

21:15.908 --> 21:18.244
TIMES.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.279
>> I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!

21:20.313 --> 21:20.847
WHAT!

21:20.880 --> 21:21.881
>> WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

21:21.914 --> 21:25.685
>> I, APPARENTLY, HAVE NO IDEA.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.588
>> AAAAHHH!

21:28.621 --> 21:31.524
PLEASE, SEND ME A NEW PARTNER!

21:31.558 --> 21:35.261
>> ALEX IS LIKE BY B.B. WIFE.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.597
WE DEFINITELY ARGUE LIKE WE'VE
BEEN MARRIED FOR 12 YEARS.

21:37.630 --> 21:43.102
>> WE NEED A CODE WORD FOR YOU
TO SHUT UP SOMETIMES YOU'RE

21:43.135 --> 21:45.338
FLICKING ME--
>> YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE

21:45.372 --> 21:46.506
DIFFERENCE.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.241
>> OKAY, YOU GIVE ME A STEIN
SIGN WHEN YOU WANT TO TALK TO

21:49.275 --> 21:51.944
ME, AND I'LL GIVE YOU A SIGN
WHEN I DON'T WANT YOU TO TALK.

21:51.978 --> 21:56.516
>> I GUESS YOU COULD CALL WHAT
WE HAVE A NO-MANCE.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.385
>> ADULTS ARE TALKING.

21:58.418 --> 21:58.885
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.087
>> WHY IS ALEX MAD?

22:01.120 --> 22:02.054
>> WHO KNOWS.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.090
>> JASON WAS BORN.

22:04.123 --> 22:07.960
>> ALEX IS A DAMN PAIN IN MY
SIDE BECAUSE EVERY CHANCE SHE

22:07.994 --> 22:12.999
GETS, SHE'S WHACKED ME WITH THAT
DAMN POLICE BATON.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.568
DAMN IT, ALEX!

22:15.602 --> 22:18.204
OR WHACKING ME WITH A PILLOW.

22:18.237 --> 22:21.240
OR ALWAYS TEASING ME IN SOME
SHAPE OR FORM.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.443
>> LOOK HOW STUPID I AM.

22:23.476 --> 22:26.379
I'M JASON.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.647
BYE, NOW.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.815
>> BRING THAT BACK!

22:28.848 --> 22:33.653
>> I'M A COWBOY.

22:33.686 --> 22:37.390
I AM A COWBOY.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.625
YAW!

22:38.658 --> 22:39.859
YAW!

22:39.892 --> 22:43.029
IT WASN'T LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT,
BUT IT'S ME AND JASON UNTIL THE

22:43.062 --> 22:43.530
END.

22:43.563 --> 22:43.930
HOW DOES HE DO THAT?

22:43.963 --> 22:44.831
I CAN'T DO IT.

22:44.864 --> 22:45.832
I CAN'T DO IT.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.034
>> IT'S GOING TO BE YOU AND ME
IN THE FINAL TWO.

22:48.067 --> 22:53.806
AND THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR ME
TO HAVE THE 500.

22:53.840 --> 22:57.477
>> ALL RIGHT, SO THERE'S ONE
MORE SHOWMANCE I WANT TO TALK

22:57.510 --> 22:58.344
ABOUT.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.646
MARK, WE KNOW ELENA LEFT IN THE
DOUBLE.

22:59.679 --> 23:00.713
>> YEAH, IT WAS TOUGH.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.348
>> HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH HER?

23:02.381 --> 23:06.352
>> I MEAN, I TOLD HER I'M A
FLIRT BUT, I MEAN, MOVING ON IN

23:06.385 --> 23:10.857
THE GAME I REALLY DEVELOPED
FEELINGS FOR HER.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.561
I LOST SOMEBODY SPECIAL TO ME
TODAY.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.795
>> AREN'T I CUTE?

23:15.828 --> 23:19.398
>> YEAH, YOU'RE PRETTY CUTE.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.367
YOU'RE GROWING ON ME EACH AND
EVERY DAY.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.301
>> EACH AND EVERY DAY?

23:22.334 --> 23:23.069
>> EVERY DAY.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.270
>> WOW.

23:24.303 --> 23:28.708
>> I'VE BEEN WANTING TO KISS
ELENA FROM THE MOMENT I MET HER

23:28.741 --> 23:35.214
AND WE'VE COME CLOSE SO MANY
TIMESS.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.449
>> OH, WOW.

23:36.483 --> 23:41.554
YOU JUST KISSED ME.

23:42.622 --> 23:45.224
* *
>> I'M TRYING NOT TO BLUSH

23:47.660 --> 23:51.330
BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE HER.

23:51.363 --> 23:56.202
>> MARK IS... SO SWEET.

23:56.235 --> 23:59.038
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO SWEET.

23:59.071 --> 24:01.340
>> I STILL LIKE YOU.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.309
>> THANKS.

24:03.342 --> 24:07.514
IN THE REAL WORLD, YOU GO ON A
DATE WITH SOMEONE, YOU HAVE YOUR

24:07.547 --> 24:08.748
FIRST KISS, BUT YOU GO HOME.

24:08.781 --> 24:13.085
YOU TACK A BATH, REFLECT, MAYBE
TEXT THEM A LITTLE IN THE NEXT

24:13.119 --> 24:15.488
COUPLE OF DAYS.

24:15.522 --> 24:16.188
CAN THEY SEE US?

24:16.222 --> 24:17.323
>> NO.

24:17.356 --> 24:19.358
>> BUT IN THE "BIG BROTHER"
WORLD, YOU HAVE A FIRST KISS

24:19.391 --> 24:22.228
WITH SOMEONE, AND THEN YOU ARE
ESSENTIALLY JUST LIVING WITH

24:22.261 --> 24:25.565
THAT PERSON.

24:26.533 --> 24:30.537
>> HOPEFULLY NOT.

24:30.570 --> 24:31.738
WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR TYPE WAS?

24:31.771 --> 24:35.975
>> I FALL FOR A GUY WHO IS
CHARMING, FUNNY, AND

24:36.008 --> 24:38.410
INTELLECTUALLY CHALLENGES ME.

24:42.448 --> 24:43.449
>> OKAY.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.418
ME AND ELENA ARE-- WE'RE DOING
GOOD.

24:46.452 --> 24:48.588
WE GET A LITTLE BIT CLOSER EVERY
DAY.

24:48.621 --> 24:51.190
BUT WE ARE VERY DIFFERENT
PEOPLE.

24:51.223 --> 24:54.994
THIS IS CLEAR LIKE OPPOSITES
ATTRACT.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.128
>> CUTE.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.196
MAKES ME LAUGH.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.598
AND FUNNY.

24:58.631 --> 24:59.566
POSITIVE.

24:59.599 --> 25:00.567
>> I'M NOT THAT.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.233
>> YOU'RE NOT.

25:01.267 --> 25:02.535
>> I'M CUTE.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.370
>> RIGHT.

25:04.403 --> 25:04.771
FUNNY.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.639
>> I AM FUNNY.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.174
AND I AM NOT POSITIVE.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.976
>> RIGHT.

25:10.009 --> 25:13.846
>> THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BECAUSE YOU
DON'T INTELLECTUALLY CHALLENGE

25:13.880 --> 25:18.685
ME.

25:18.718 --> 25:22.188
>> INTELLECTUALLY CHALLENGE YOU
IN WHAT WAY.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.323
>> IN AN INTELLECTUAL WAY.

25:24.356 --> 25:38.270
>> I REALLY LIKE ELENA, EVEN
WHEN SHE'S MEAN TO ME.

25:38.304 --> 25:43.910
>> I ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH
YOU, BUT LOGICALLY, DISTANCING

25:43.943 --> 25:47.479
MYSELF FROM YOU MAKES SENSE.

25:47.513 --> 25:50.116
MY RELATIONSHIP STATUS WITH MARK
RIGHT NOW IS COMPLICATED.

25:50.149 --> 25:54.954
HE'S REALLY GREAT, ENJOY BEING
AROUND HIM, EXANSHIP,

25:54.987 --> 25:56.188
CHECK-PLUS.

25:56.222 --> 26:02.595
HOWEVER, I HAVE CONCERNS THAT A
SHOWMANCE COULD HURT MY GAME.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.964
$500,000, CHECK
PLUS-PLUS-PLUS-PLUS.

26:04.997 --> 26:08.635
IT'S NOT BECAUSE I NECESSARILY
LIKE THE WAY I FEEL HAS CHANGED

26:08.668 --> 26:09.769
A TON.

26:09.802 --> 26:13.706
IT'S JUST THAT PERCEPTION IS
EVERYTHING, AND IF IT'S BACK

26:13.740 --> 26:16.408
STEPPING AWAY FROM YOU IMPROVES
MY GAME--

26:16.442 --> 26:17.744
>> I'LL GIVE YOU SPACE.

26:17.777 --> 26:22.649
>> MY ADVICE TO YOU IS TO USE
ANY DISTANCE YOU HAVE FROM ME TO

26:22.682 --> 26:25.517
GET CLOSE TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE
HOUSE.

26:25.551 --> 26:26.518
BE CHARMING.

26:26.552 --> 26:28.387
BE FUNNY.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.257
PEOPLE LIKE BEING AROUND YOU.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.559
>> EXCEPT FOR YOU.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.028
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO, LIKE, SHUN
YOU.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.529
I WANT TO BE AROUND YOU.

26:37.563 --> 26:42.101
>> YEAH, WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.470
TAKE YOUR SPACE.

26:44.503 --> 26:47.339
OBSERVE HOWEVER LONG YOU WANT,
WHATEVER ULTIMATE.

26:47.373 --> 26:50.743
ELENA TELLING ME THAT SHE NEEDS
DISTANCE FROM ME IN THE GAME, I

26:50.777 --> 26:53.913
CAN UNDERSTAND FROM A STRATEGIC
PERSPECTIVE.

26:53.946 --> 26:58.918
BUT IT FEELS LIKE SHE'S LEAVING
ME OUT TO DRY, AND IT HURTS.

26:58.951 --> 27:13.499
I HAD MORE THAN JUST GAME
FEELINGS FOR HER, AND... LAWYER

27:13.532 --> 27:14.200
AND...

27:14.233 --> 27:15.668
>> I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK.

27:15.702 --> 27:18.404
>> DON'T WISH ME THE BEST OF
LUCK.

27:18.437 --> 27:18.905
THAT'S SO COLD.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.673
>> WHY IS THAT COLD.

27:20.707 --> 27:24.110
>> JUST BECAUSE WE'RE NOT A
SHOWMANCE DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE

27:24.143 --> 27:25.144
EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

27:25.177 --> 27:29.248
>> I HOPE THIS WORKS OUT FOR
YOU.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.283
I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

28:01.613 --> 28:05.384
OF DRAMA IN THE HOUSE, THERE'S
ALSO BEEN A TON OF LAUGHTER,

28:05.417 --> 28:06.618
TOO.

28:06.652 --> 28:10.089
ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED FROM
MY SEASON, WHEN YOU LIVE WITH

28:10.122 --> 28:12.825
SOMEONE LONG ENOUGH, YOU GET TO
LEARN THEIR TRAITS.

28:12.859 --> 28:17.563
HOW DO YOU EAT ALL THAT CEREAL
AND KEEP THOSE ABS.

28:17.596 --> 28:19.031
YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.232
I'M SERIOUS.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.634
>> YOU SEEM LIKE THE KIND OF
PERSON WHO PRETTY MUCH EATS THE

28:22.668 --> 28:24.203
SAME THING ALMOST EVERY DAY.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.404
>> ALMOST EVERY DAY.

28:25.437 --> 28:30.409
>> WHAT WOULD YOU EAT BREAKFAST,
LUNCH, AND DINNER EVERY DAY.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.411
>> I'M A CEREAL JUNKY.

28:32.444 --> 28:36.749
I TRY TO KEEP IT A HEALTHIER
SEARABLE, BUT SOMETIMES NOT.

28:36.783 --> 28:39.919
IM, ADMITTEDLY, A MASSIVE CEREAL
JUNKY.

28:39.952 --> 28:43.455
I HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN KNOWN TO
EAT ENTIRE BOXES IN A SINGLE

28:43.489 --> 28:44.723
SITTING.

28:44.757 --> 28:47.293
MY CEREAL HABIT CAN BE A LITTLE
BIT EMBARRASSING AT TIMES, SO IN

28:47.326 --> 28:49.762
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE, I HAVE
FOUND IT BEST TO GET UP IN THE

28:49.796 --> 28:53.632
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND JUST
POUND BOWLS OF CEREAL BY MYSELF

28:53.665 --> 29:03.776
WHEN NOBODY ELSE IS THERE.

29:03.776 --> 29:08.747
WHEN NOBODY ELSE IS THERE.

29:08.781 --> 29:16.655
>> ARE YOU EATING CEREAL IN THE

29:16.688 --> 29:17.256
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

29:17.289 --> 29:18.791
>> IS THAT MATT?

29:18.825 --> 29:20.159
OH, MATT.

29:20.192 --> 29:24.663
>> MATT'S LOVE FOR CEREAL IS
KIND OF STARTING TO TOE THE LINE

29:24.696 --> 29:25.531
TO OBSESSION.

29:25.564 --> 29:26.933
I'M NOT JUDGING HIM.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.902
I ACTUALLY RESPECT IT, BUT IT'S
CEEND OF STRANGE.

29:29.936 --> 29:33.739
>> DO YOU EAT CEREAL AT HOME?

29:33.772 --> 29:36.909
>> I CAN'T REALLY KEEP CEREAL IN
THE HOUSE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.310
I'M ALWAYS EATING IT.

29:38.344 --> 29:39.378
IT'S SO BAD.

29:39.411 --> 29:42.714
>> THE KID EATS TWO, FOUR, FIVE,
SIX BOWLS OF CEREAL.

29:42.748 --> 29:48.420
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE KEEPS
THAT PHYSIQUE AND EATS SO MUCH

29:48.454 --> 29:49.088
CEREAL.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.356
WHAT'S THE CEREAL FOR TONIGHT.

29:50.389 --> 29:55.895
>> S'MORES WHAT DO I LIKE ABOUT
CEREAL THE MOST?

29:55.928 --> 29:56.762
LITERALLY EVERYTHING.

29:56.795 --> 29:57.964
IT'S SUGARY.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.632
THEY MAKE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT
MAGICAL FLAVORS AND THEN YOU

30:00.666 --> 30:08.474
COMBINE IT WITH MILK, AND IT'S
THE PERFECT FOOD.

30:08.507 --> 30:12.678
* *

30:20.119 --> 30:23.689
>> WHO WOULD EAT, LIKE, FOUR
GRAINS OF CEREAL.

30:23.722 --> 30:28.160
>> IN MY SEASON, DONNY WAS THE
EARLY RISER.

30:28.194 --> 30:33.399
KEVIN, YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF LAPS
AROUND THAT BACKYARD EVERY

30:33.432 --> 30:34.433
MORNING.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.668
>> I USUALLY GO ALONE, AND THEN
MY PAL COMES OVER.

30:36.702 --> 30:41.240
>> I'M DOING ABS WORKOUTS AND
WALK AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE

30:41.273 --> 30:43.375
THIS GUY JUST TELLS JOKES THE
ENTIRE TIME.

30:43.409 --> 30:44.343
>> DO YOU LIKE THE OCEAN?

30:44.376 --> 30:45.577
>> YEAH, I LOVE WATER.

30:45.611 --> 30:46.812
>> MAN, ME, TOO, MAN.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.280
I LOVE THE OCEAN, MAN.

30:48.314 --> 30:50.349
LIKE, I DON'T EVEN SIT WHEN I GO
TO THE BEACH.

30:50.382 --> 30:53.185
>> EVERY MORNING, KEVIN AND I
TAKE OUR MORNING WALKS AROUND

30:53.219 --> 30:54.320
THE YARD.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.689
I WOULD NEVER TRADE IT FOR THE
WORLD BECAUSE THIS DUDE IS

30:57.723 --> 30:58.724
HILARIOUS.

30:58.757 --> 31:01.460
I MEAN, HE JUST TALKS ABOUT THE
MOST RANDOM STUFF.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.362
>> BUT I'M TELLING YOU WHAT.

31:03.395 --> 31:07.333
TWO THINGS ON THE NEWS ALL THE
TIME-- SHARK SIGHTING ON THE

31:07.366 --> 31:08.467
CAPE.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.603
AND THEN SOME POOR FISHERMAN
WILL BRING A 10-FOOT SHARK.

31:11.637 --> 31:14.640
THE POOR SHARK IS HUNG UPSIDE
DOWN IN TOWN CENTER.

31:14.673 --> 31:17.743
EVERYONE KICKS AT IT, SPITS AT.

31:17.776 --> 31:21.880
THE SHARK IS LIKE PLEASE THROW
ME IN THE WATER.

31:21.914 --> 31:24.984
I DON'T KNOW THE LAST TIME
SOMEONE GOT BIT IN THEIR BEDROOM

31:25.017 --> 31:26.118
BY A SHARK.

31:26.152 --> 31:28.720
THE HUMAN BEINGS ARE THE REAL
ANIMALS, NOT THE SHARKS.

31:28.754 --> 31:30.089
YOU WANT TO KNOW WORSE?

31:30.122 --> 31:32.758
WHAT ABOUT THE POOR ANIMALS IN
THE ZOO.

31:32.791 --> 31:35.527
PEOPLE COME AND MAKE FUN OF THE
MONKEYS STANDING THERE.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.796
LEAVE THE... MONKEYS ALONE, MAN.

31:37.829 --> 31:41.333
IF YOU WANT TO SEE A MONKEY, GO
TO AFRICA AND SEE A MONKEY.

31:41.367 --> 31:46.438
IT'S EASY TO SEE A SILVERBACK
BEHIND 13 INCHES OF GLASS AND

31:46.472 --> 31:48.640
YOU'RE LIKE THIS TO THE
SILVERBACK.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.442
AND THE SILVERBACK IS LIKE THIS.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.744
MAN, LET ME JUST GET ONE OF
THESE ONE TIME.

31:52.778 --> 31:56.715
AND THE SILVERBACK IS LOOKING
LIKE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

31:56.748 --> 32:01.253
THE MONKEYS ARE LIKE, "YOU THINK
WE'RE STUPID?"

32:01.287 --> 32:03.789
LEAVE THE ...MONKEYS ALONE.

32:03.822 --> 32:06.192
>> HE'S GONE MAD.

32:06.225 --> 32:07.926
"BIG BROTHER," HE'S GONE MAD!

32:07.960 --> 32:08.860
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

32:08.894 --> 32:12.231
>> WE ALL KNOW JESSICA'S GONE
.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.365
>> YAY!

32:13.399 --> 32:14.566
YAY!

32:14.600 --> 32:16.735
>> AND ONE OF HER TRAITS WAS SHE
WAS GOOD AT SPELLING, RIGHT?

32:16.768 --> 32:18.204
>> OH, MY GOD!

32:18.237 --> 32:21.640
>> ALTHOUGH, SHE DIDN'T ALWAYS
HAVE THE BEST VOCABULARY.

32:21.673 --> 32:25.111
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, SHE
DIDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

32:25.144 --> 32:26.812
BETWEEN HEISMAN AND ANOTHER
WORD.

32:26.845 --> 32:30.949
>> OH!

32:43.395 --> 32:45.431
>> THE HYMEN.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.166
>> THE HEISMAN?

32:47.199 --> 32:49.001

HAVING A LOT OF FUN THIS

34:21.059 --> 34:23.662
CERTAINLY BUT EVEN SOMETIMES THE
FUN CAN TURN UGLY, ESPECIALLY

34:23.695 --> 34:27.466
WHEN THERE'S PICKLE JUICE
INVOLVED.

34:27.499 --> 34:28.434
>> OH!

CONTROL ONE DAY.

34:31.270 --> 34:35.374

36:00.459 --> 36:02.294

>> HE DIDN'T BEAT ME.

36:34.460 --> 36:37.263
>> I AGREE THAT HE DIDN'T BEAT
YOU.

36:37.296 --> 36:42.468
I DON'T AGREE THAT THAT WAS A
GOOD IDEA, HOWEVER.

36:42.501 --> 36:43.735

YOU SHOULD HAVE DRANK IT.

P.T.S.D.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.158
IT REALLY DOES.

37:40.191 --> 37:42.994
IT IS A LITTLE WEIRD BEING BACK
IN THIS ROOM ESPECIALLY SINCE I

37:43.028 --> 37:46.064
DIDN'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON
THE THIS COUCH.

37:46.097 --> 37:49.167
