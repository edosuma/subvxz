04:27.809 --> 04:29.936
Finish work!

04:30.145 --> 04:31.395
Go to hut.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.147
Yeah, that figures.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.151
If the new prisoners see us
digging graves, they may run.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.446
No time for jokes. Finish work!

04:41.406 --> 04:42.657
Dig, dig.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.451
How about putting us
on sick list?

04:46.078 --> 04:48.788
Have a heart, captain.
Put us in hospital.

04:49.039 --> 04:52.333
You no sick. You never sick.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.044
Why you always play sick
to me, Shears?

04:55.253 --> 04:58.172
Don't want one of these
over my head, I guess.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.716
Captain Kanematsu...

05:02.386 --> 05:03.636
how about a butt?

05:03.887 --> 05:06.555
I give you butt this morning.
Both of you.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.059
That's what I mean.
I want to return the favour.

05:10.227 --> 05:13.062
When a man gives a gift
from the goodness of his heart...

05:13.271 --> 05:17.149
like you gave me that butt,
I remember it from the heart.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.277
That's why...

05:21.238 --> 05:23.406
I want you to keep this lighter.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.245
Think I stole it?

05:29.454 --> 05:32.164
It belonged to that English kid
we just buried.

05:32.416 --> 05:35.126
He willed it to me
for a favour I'd done him.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.337
Before I pass on,
I want to do the same for you.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.132
You funny man, Shears.

05:43.385 --> 05:46.971
Okay, you go on sick list. Him too.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.976
One of these days Colonel Saito
will catch you bribing him...

05:52.227 --> 05:53.853
then where'll we be?

05:55.689 --> 05:58.858
Before that happens
we'll be far away from here, chum.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.152
Far away.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.863
Okay, let's knock off.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.616
Here lies...

06:09.411 --> 06:11.245
Weaver, I forgot who we just buried.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.747
Thomson.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.290
Yes.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.584
Here lies
Corporal Herbert Thomson...

06:16.752 --> 06:20.546
serial number 01234567.

06:20.756 --> 06:25.760
Valiant member of the King's Own
or the Queen's Own or something...

06:26.470 --> 06:30.556
who died of beriberi
in the year of our Lord, 1943...

06:31.016 --> 06:33.267
for the greater glory of...

06:34.728 --> 06:36.645
- What did he die for?
- Come off it.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.148
No need to mock the grave.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.443
I don't mock the grave or the man.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.571
May he rest in peace.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.160
He found little enough of it
while he was alive.

08:46.776 --> 08:50.362
"A" Company, mark time!

09:04.211 --> 09:07.213
Mark time!

10:21.371 --> 10:22.621
Halt.

10:24.624 --> 10:28.877
Into line, left turn.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.090
Stand easy.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.309
We're gonna be a busy pair
of gravediggers, Weaver.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.811
Well done, well done.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.948
That colonel doesn't know
what he's in for.

10:58.199 --> 11:01.452
- You gonna tell him the truth?
- Of course not.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.746
You're neither an officer
nor a gentleman.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.947
My name is Nicholson.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.117
I am Colonel Saito.

11:54.089 --> 11:58.801
In the name of
His Imperial Majesty...

11:59.010 --> 12:00.886
I welcome you.

12:01.262 --> 12:05.057
I am the commanding officer
of this camp...

12:05.350 --> 12:08.310
which is Camp 16...

12:08.561 --> 12:10.854
along the great railroad...

12:11.022 --> 12:16.485
which will soon connect
Bangkok with Rangoon.

12:17.821 --> 12:21.782
You British prisoners
have been chosen...

12:22.033 --> 12:25.202
to build a bridge
across the River Kwai.

12:26.204 --> 12:30.416
It will be pleasant work,
requiring skill.

12:30.667 --> 12:35.629
And officers will work
as well as men.

12:35.797 --> 12:41.093
The Japanese army cannot
have idle mouths to feed.

12:42.053 --> 12:46.306
If you work hard,
you will be treated well.

12:47.142 --> 12:50.102
But if you do not work hard...

12:50.311 --> 12:52.896
you will be punished.

12:54.149 --> 12:57.818
A word to you about escape.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.155
There is no barbed wire.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.449
No stockade.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.451
No watchtower.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.121
They are not necessary.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.040
We are an island in the jungle.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.210
Escape is impossible.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.255
You would die.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.886
Today you rest.
Tomorrow you'll begin.

13:26.181 --> 13:30.142
Let me remind you of
General Yamashita's motto:

13:30.685 --> 13:32.269
"Be happy in your work."

13:32.562 --> 13:34.938
Be happy in your work.

13:37.692 --> 13:38.942
Dismissed.

13:43.656 --> 13:47.159
Battalion, stand at ease.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.827
Fall out, Major Hughes.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.205
Battalion, stand easy.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.500
Get the men to their quarters.
See who's sick.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.127
I'm gonna have a word
with this fellow. Colonel!

14:02.967 --> 14:05.385
I heard your remarks just now, sir.

14:05.887 --> 14:09.348
My men will carry on in the way
one expects of a British soldier.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.935
My officers and I
will be responsible for their conduct.

14:13.186 --> 14:17.272
You may have overlooked the fact
that the use of officers for labour...

14:17.482 --> 14:19.858
is expressly forbidden
by the Geneva Convention.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.401
Is that so?

14:21.611 --> 14:23.320
I have a copy of the Convention...

14:23.530 --> 14:26.532
and would be glad to
let you glance through it.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.159
That will not be necessary.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.455
Sit down, please.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.507
Yes, sir.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.219
- I'm gonna have a word with Clipton.
- Very good, sir.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.514
Clipton, don't let me interrupt.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.558
- How's the arm?
- Nearly healed.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.728
Sir, this is Commander Shears
of the United States Navy.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.688
- Good.
- How do you do, sir?

16:21.856 --> 16:23.357
We found him and an Australian.

16:23.524 --> 16:26.026
All that's left of the prisoners
who built the camp.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.861
U.S. Navy? Out here?

16:28.112 --> 16:30.113
For a sailor, I am sort of landlocked.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.532
- You lost your ship?
- The Houston.

16:32.784 --> 16:36.244
I made it ashore, but I got separated
from the other survivors.

16:36.454 --> 16:37.871
And your group here?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.332
Mostly Aussies. Some lime...

16:40.541 --> 16:42.834
Some British.
Indians, Burmese, Siamese.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.753
And what happened to them?

16:44.921 --> 16:46.380
They died...

16:47.256 --> 16:51.802
of malaria, dysentery,
beriberi, gangrene.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.387
Other causes of death:

16:53.554 --> 16:57.641
Famine, overwork, bullet wounds,
snakebites...

16:58.101 --> 16:59.601
Saito.

17:00.311 --> 17:03.146
Then there were some
who just got tired of living.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.647
Has Clipton seen you?

17:04.898 --> 17:08.819
Just about to, sir. Come over here,
commander, you can shave later.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.444
All right.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.907
You'll stay with the officers.

17:15.076 --> 17:16.867
We'll scrape up
some decent clothing.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.537
Don't bother about me.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.997
I'm not anxious to
get off the sick list.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.084
Besides, this is working kit.
It's the fashion out here.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.461
The officers in your party
did manual labour?

17:26.671 --> 17:28.380
I think you could call it that.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.842
I raised that very point
with Colonel what's-his-name.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.301
Saito.

17:33.511 --> 17:36.680
- I think he understands now.
- Is that so?

17:36.848 --> 17:39.975
Yes. I must say he seems
quite a reasonable type.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.102
Well, I must be pushing on.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.146
There's an officer's meeting at 7.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.315
- Give me a list of your requirements.
- Yes, sir.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.317
Anything we can do.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.194
Oh, thank you, sir.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.866
- What is it?
- Never mind.

17:56.117 --> 17:57.909
Go on, say it.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.871
I can think of a lot of things
to call Saito...

18:01.122 --> 18:04.583
but reasonable, that's a new one.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.919
Perhaps Colonel Nicholson
defines the word differently.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.096
Any other points?

18:18.264 --> 18:19.931
- By your leave, sir?
- Yes, Jennings?

18:20.099 --> 18:23.226
About the escape committee.
I've spoken with Commander Shears...

18:23.394 --> 18:25.312
There won't be any
escape committee.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.148
I don't understand, sir.
Lieutenant Jennings has a plan.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.151
Yes, yes, I'm sure Jennings
has a plan, but escape?

18:31.360 --> 18:35.781
Where? Into this jungle?
That fellow, Saito, is right.

18:36.032 --> 18:40.035
No need for barbed wire here.
One chance in 100 of survival.

18:40.870 --> 18:44.414
I'm sure a man of Commander Shears'
experience will back me up on that.

18:44.707 --> 18:48.293
I'd say the odds against a
successful escape are 100 to one.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.545
- Right.
- But may I add another word?

18:50.713 --> 18:51.963
Please.

18:52.173 --> 18:55.383
The odds against survival in this camp
are even worse.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.512
You've seen the graveyard.
They're your real odds.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.138
To give up hope of escape...

19:00.306 --> 19:03.725
to stop thinking about it,
is like accepting a death sentence.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.561
Why haven't you tried to escape,
commander?

19:06.813 --> 19:10.690
I'm biding my time. Waiting for
the right moment, the right company.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.984
I understand how you feel.

19:13.694 --> 19:18.114
Of course, it's the duty of a
captured soldier to attempt escape.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.243
But my men and I are involved
in a curious legal point...

19:21.410 --> 19:23.662
of which you are unaware.

19:23.913 --> 19:27.582
In Singapore we were ordered to
surrender by command headquarters.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.501
Ordered, mind you.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.463
Therefore, in our case, escape might
well be an infraction of military law.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.799
- Interesting?
- Yes, sir, interesting point.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.552
I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't quite follow you.

19:38.761 --> 19:42.430
You intend to uphold the letter
of the law, no matter what it costs?

19:42.640 --> 19:45.308
Without law, commander,
there is no civilisation.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.937
That's just my point.
Here, there is no civilisation.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.982
Then we have the opportunity
to introduce it.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.318
I suggest we drop
the subject of escape.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.072
Is there anything else?

20:01.868 --> 20:03.869
I think we're all clear
on the programme.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.747
I want everything to go off without
a hitch starting tomorrow morning.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.541
And remember this:

20:09.792 --> 20:12.878
Our men must always feel
they are still commanded by us...

20:13.045 --> 20:15.046
and not by the Japanese.

20:15.298 --> 20:19.551
So long as they have that idea,
they'll be soldiers and not slaves.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.887
Are you with me there, commander?

20:23.890 --> 20:26.016
Well, I...

20:26.267 --> 20:29.519
I hope they can
remain soldiers, colonel.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.897
As for me, I'm just a slave.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.481
A living slave.

20:46.495 --> 20:49.748
Queer bird. Even for an Ameri...

20:50.499 --> 20:53.001
He's been in isolation too long,
poor chap.

20:53.252 --> 20:57.339
Cut off from his unit.
It should be a lesson to all of us.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.773
English prisoners!

21:16.275 --> 21:20.612
Notice I do not say English soldiers.

21:21.822 --> 21:26.701
From the moment you surrendered,
you ceased to be soldiers.

21:27.578 --> 21:33.166
You will finish the bridge
by the 12th day of May.

21:33.334 --> 21:38.213
You will work under the direction
of a Japanese engineer.

21:42.051 --> 21:45.679
Time is short. All men will work.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.974
Your officers will work beside you.

21:49.225 --> 21:50.976
This is only just...

21:51.310 --> 21:55.230
for it is they
who betrayed you by surrender.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.066
Your shame is their dishonour.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.777
It is they who told you...

22:01.070 --> 22:05.615
better to live like a coolie
then die like a hero.

22:05.950 --> 22:09.119
It is they who brought you here,
not I.

22:09.704 --> 22:14.833
Therefore, they will join you
in useful labour.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.127
That is all.

22:17.503 --> 22:21.423
Officer prisoners, collect your tools.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.217
Bradley, back in your place.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.184
I must call your attention,
Colonel Saito...

22:33.394 --> 22:36.104
to Article 27
of the Geneva Convention.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.482
"Belligerents may employ
prisoners of war...

22:39.734 --> 22:41.776
who are fit,
other than officers..."

22:42.028 --> 22:43.278
Give me the book.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.114
By all means.
You read English, I take it?

22:46.282 --> 22:48.450
- Do you read Japanese?
- I'm sorry, no.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.953
If it's a matter of translation,
I'm sure it can be arranged.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.164
You see, the Code states that...

22:56.417 --> 22:58.418
Stand fast in the ranks.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.504
You speak to me of code?

23:02.673 --> 23:04.257
What code?

23:04.467 --> 23:06.676
The coward's code!

23:08.054 --> 23:10.430
What do you know
of the soldier's code?

23:10.681 --> 23:13.850
Of Bushido? Nothing!

23:14.143 --> 23:16.561
You are unworthy of command!

23:29.366 --> 23:32.535
Since you refuse to abide by the laws
of the civilised world...

23:32.787 --> 23:36.414
we must consider ourselves
absolved from our duty to obey you.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.918
My officers will not
do manual labour.

23:40.377 --> 23:41.878
We shall see.

23:44.882 --> 23:48.885
All enlisted prisoners to work.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.690
Sergeant Major!
Take the men to work.

24:04.068 --> 24:06.611
Battalion, take up tools.

24:09.406 --> 24:13.701
Move to the left in columnar route.
Left turn!

24:14.203 --> 24:18.706
"A" Company, by the right,
quick march.

24:20.876 --> 24:25.380
Eyes right.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.973
Eyes front.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.313
Eyes right.

24:43.232 --> 24:47.068
Quick march, eyes right.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.040
"C" Company, by the right.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.084
What's he up to?

25:05.796 --> 25:08.548
Looks like he doesn't
want any witnesses.

25:24.565 --> 25:27.442
Now, you will be reasonable.

25:28.444 --> 25:30.945
You will order your officers to work.

25:31.113 --> 25:32.655
No.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.688
I will count three.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.899
If by the third count...

26:08.150 --> 26:12.570
you and your officers
are not on the way to work...

26:12.821 --> 26:15.490
I will give the order to fire.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.168
He's going to do it.

26:27.878 --> 26:30.213
Believe me,
he's really going to do it.

26:40.557 --> 26:41.891
One.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.601
I warn you, Colonel Saito.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.353
Two.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.732
Stop!

26:54.947 --> 26:57.615
Colonel Saito,
I've seen and heard everything.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.742
So has every man in the hospital.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.452
There are too many witnesses.

27:01.620 --> 27:05.623
You can't call it a mass escape.
Most of those men can't walk.

27:08.127 --> 27:11.963
Is this your soldier's code?
Murdering unarmed men?

28:23.952 --> 28:28.122
You see, Jennings, there are certain
advantages to being on the sick list.

28:28.290 --> 28:31.292
I'll say this for the old man.
He's got guts.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.795
"Into the valley of death
rode the 600."

28:34.046 --> 28:35.463
How's that, sir?

28:36.090 --> 28:37.632
That kind of guts.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.634
Also the kind they had in 1914...

28:39.885 --> 28:42.553
when officers fought
with only a swagger stick.

28:42.805 --> 28:46.057
- I see what you mean.
- You don't see what I mean at all.

28:46.350 --> 28:49.185
The kind of guts
that can get us all killed.

29:29.726 --> 29:33.604
Excuse me, sir,
I'd like to go along too.

29:34.857 --> 29:37.775
Arm's almost healed, sir,
really it is.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.069
What about him?

29:40.863 --> 29:43.739
He didn't order us not to escape,
he suggested.

29:44.032 --> 29:48.828
Listen, when a man like your colonel
suggests something, it's an order.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.539
Here we go again.

30:01.341 --> 30:05.094
Colonel Saito says all officers
to punishment hut.

30:05.596 --> 30:07.180
Tell them to go.

30:15.189 --> 30:16.898
Not you.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.079
Come.

30:53.227 --> 30:58.397
Leave him alone!

31:51.034 --> 31:53.327
They're gonna put him in the oven.

32:14.266 --> 32:20.229
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

32:20.397 --> 32:24.150
For he's a jolly good fellow

32:24.318 --> 32:26.694
And so say all of us

32:26.862 --> 32:31.699
And so say all of us
And so say all of us

32:31.908 --> 32:37.038
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

32:37.205 --> 32:40.791
For he's a jolly good fellow

32:40.959 --> 32:43.336
And so say all of us

34:51.757 --> 34:53.841
Timber!

34:58.847 --> 35:01.447
One, two, three, four.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.859
No, no, no!

35:12.527 --> 35:16.697
Let go!

36:04.913 --> 36:06.413
You wish to see me?

36:06.665 --> 36:08.916
I've been trying to see you
for three days.

36:09.084 --> 36:12.211
It's about Colonel Nicholson.
He's been shut up in that hut...

36:15.173 --> 36:17.424
I could have you shot.

36:17.926 --> 36:22.263
Those prisoners who tried to escape,
they were in your charge.

36:22.764 --> 36:24.348
I knew nothing about the escape.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.184
It does not matter.

36:27.435 --> 36:30.312
One must even respect
those who tried.

36:30.564 --> 36:34.316
For a brief moment,
between escape and death...

36:34.568 --> 36:36.277
they were soldiers again.

36:38.321 --> 36:41.448
But it is insane to try and escape.

36:41.658 --> 36:45.953
Two soldiers shot,
the third drowned.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.663
To what end?

36:47.873 --> 36:50.749
It was an escape from reality.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.759
There is your reality.

37:01.052 --> 37:05.764
This shows the position work
should have reached by noon today.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.852
And this shows the position
of actual progress.

37:12.022 --> 37:14.440
Because of your
colonel's stubbornness...

37:14.608 --> 37:16.775
we are far behind schedule.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.068
That is not all.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.572
Enlisted prisoners
sabotaged the work.

37:21.781 --> 37:25.743
Yes, I have seen it.
I could have them all shot.

37:26.202 --> 37:28.621
Then who would build your bridge?

37:28.872 --> 37:30.831
Besides, are you sure it's sabotage?

37:31.082 --> 37:34.126
Perhaps the men don't work well
without their own officers.

37:34.377 --> 37:39.173
My officers will direct them.
Your officers will work beside them.

37:39.382 --> 37:43.302
That's for Colonel Nicholson to decide.
As he said, it's against the rules.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.638
Do not speak to me of rules.

37:45.889 --> 37:47.681
This is war!

37:48.099 --> 37:50.017
This is not a game of cricket.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.649
He's mad, your colonel...

37:58.276 --> 38:00.027
quite mad.

38:02.656 --> 38:04.531
Sit down, please.

38:09.871 --> 38:13.415
I have decided to allow you
one visit to your colonel.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.125
Thank you.

38:15.919 --> 38:19.838
Tell him that if his officers
will not work...

38:20.090 --> 38:23.050
I'll be forced
to close the hospital...

38:23.301 --> 38:26.679
and your patients will
work in their place.

38:26.930 --> 38:31.266
And many will die,
and he will be responsible.

38:31.935 --> 38:35.980
Go and speak to him.
You have five minutes.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.636
Hey, the doc's going
to see the old man.

39:11.516 --> 39:12.766
Sir...

39:17.147 --> 39:18.605
It's Clipton, sir.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.609
I brought you a few things.

39:27.741 --> 39:30.451
- How are the men?
- Fine, sir, fine.

39:30.702 --> 39:34.872
We scraped together a little meat
and a coconut.

39:37.959 --> 39:39.543
And the officers?

39:39.711 --> 39:42.504
Oh, they're not so good.
They're still in detention.

39:42.672 --> 39:46.967
And Lieutenant Jennings...
Jennings is dead.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.720
- What?
- Killed, attempting to escape.

39:49.971 --> 39:53.432
Also two others,
Corporal Weaver and the American.

39:54.559 --> 39:58.145
Jennings. Poor, brave lad.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.564
I warned him, didn't I, Clipton?

40:00.815 --> 40:03.650
Look, sir, we haven't much time.

40:07.822 --> 40:10.449
I'm going to clean you up a little
while I talk.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.826
I've got something to tell you.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.537
I've just had a word with Saito.

40:15.872 --> 40:19.458
That man is the worst commanding
officer I've ever come across.

40:19.667 --> 40:23.545
Actually, I think he's mad. Carry on.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.230
Blackmail.

40:41.481 --> 40:46.110
I know, sir, but he means it.
I'm sure he does.

40:46.361 --> 40:49.988
It's a question of face, pure and simple.
And he can't give in.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.574
It's still blackmail.

40:54.828 --> 40:59.331
Sir, you can't stand
much more of this.

40:59.624 --> 41:04.753
Wouldn't the officers be better off
working than suffocating in that hole?

41:06.089 --> 41:10.008
The men are doing a wonderful job.
They're going as slow as they dare.

41:10.218 --> 41:13.303
But Saito's cut their food rations...

41:13.555 --> 41:15.639
and if he makes
the sick men work...

41:15.890 --> 41:19.726
Well, they're going to die.
That's all there is to it.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.729
Yes, Clipton, I understand. Truly.

41:22.981 --> 41:25.524
But don't you see?
It's a matter of principle.

41:25.775 --> 41:29.570
If we give in now,
there'll be no end to it. No.

41:32.907 --> 41:37.077
Sir, we're lost in the jungle,
a thousand miles from anywhere.

41:37.287 --> 41:40.789
We're under the heel of a man
who'll stop at nothing to get his way.

41:40.957 --> 41:41.999
Principle!

41:42.500 --> 41:46.378
No one will ever know or care
what happens to us.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.131
Give in, sir. Please!

41:49.465 --> 41:50.841
I'm adamant.

41:51.092 --> 41:54.803
I will not have an officer
from my battalion working as a coolie.

41:55.054 --> 41:57.097
- Time.
- All right.

41:59.684 --> 42:02.519
Please thank those concerned.

42:02.896 --> 42:05.647
Everybody in the hospital
contributed one piece.

42:05.899 --> 42:07.524
Reynolds stole the coconut.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.987
We'll be able to get you
something from time to time.

42:12.155 --> 42:14.615
We've bribed one of your guards.

42:21.289 --> 42:24.833
Goodbye, sir. And good luck.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.627
Many thanks.

42:31.007 --> 42:33.717
- Clipton!
- Yes, sir?

42:34.427 --> 42:36.637
Did you say that American chap
was killed?

42:36.804 --> 42:39.014
Yes, sir. Shot and drowned.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.602
It's insane to plan escapes.

42:44.646 --> 42:47.689
Three men killed, and to what end?

42:47.941 --> 42:49.942
- Time!
- Here.

42:50.109 --> 42:52.486
- Here is where we must win through.
- Time, time!

43:12.590 --> 43:16.760
The doc just looked at us and shook
his head. Whatever that means.

43:16.970 --> 43:20.555
Means only one thing,
colonel won't give in.

43:33.361 --> 43:34.653
Well?

43:34.988 --> 43:36.571
It's like this.

43:36.864 --> 43:39.491
Colonel Nicholson
won't give in to force.

43:39.742 --> 43:41.868
It's a question of principle.

43:42.412 --> 43:45.580
As medical officer, I protest
to the way he's being treated.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.791
It's a wonder he's still alive.

43:48.001 --> 43:52.004
Should a tragedy occur,
it would be tantamount to murder.

43:54.132 --> 43:56.383
He is responsible.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.052
Not I.

44:09.522 --> 44:10.939
You sick?

44:14.235 --> 44:16.778
Are they both mad?

44:18.323 --> 44:20.324
Or am I going mad?

44:22.327 --> 44:23.702
Or is it the sun?

47:26.302 --> 47:27.802
Attention!

47:29.096 --> 47:31.765
Battalion, attention.

47:34.602 --> 47:36.770
English prisoners.

47:37.188 --> 47:39.481
Let us ask the question...

47:39.732 --> 47:42.901
why does the bridge not progress?

47:43.444 --> 47:48.615
You know why,
because your officers are lazy!

47:49.116 --> 47:53.245
They think themselves too good
to share your burden.

47:54.330 --> 47:55.789
This is not just.

47:56.040 --> 47:59.209
Therefore, you are not happy
in your work.

47:59.877 --> 48:03.421
Therefore, the bridge
does not progress.

48:04.131 --> 48:06.216
But there is another cause.

48:06.467 --> 48:09.511
I do not hide the truth.

48:10.137 --> 48:12.639
With deep shame and regret...

48:12.890 --> 48:15.183
I admit to you the failure...

48:15.434 --> 48:18.270
of a member of the Japanese staff.

48:18.479 --> 48:20.730
I refer to Lieutenant Miura.

48:21.482 --> 48:23.400
He is a bad engineer.

48:23.651 --> 48:25.902
He is unworthy of command.

48:26.362 --> 48:30.865
Therefore, I have removed him
from his post.

48:32.743 --> 48:36.663
Tomorrow we begin again.

48:37.081 --> 48:40.375
I shall be in personal command.

48:40.876 --> 48:42.961
Today we rest.

48:44.922 --> 48:49.551
All work and no play
make Jack a dull boy.

48:50.052 --> 48:53.513
As token of regard
for your efforts in the future...

48:53.764 --> 48:56.308
I give presents to you all.

49:08.529 --> 49:11.031
Let us be happy in our work.

49:11.949 --> 49:14.701
Company, dismissed.

49:16.078 --> 49:19.581
Battalion, dismissed.

49:33.971 --> 49:36.222
Hey, take a look at this.

49:36.390 --> 49:38.516
Red Cross! He's given us our...

49:38.726 --> 49:42.520
Hey, he's given us
our own Red Cross parcels.

49:42.730 --> 49:46.066
"Tomorrow we begin again."

50:51.132 --> 50:53.133
Hey, Harry, look.

50:53.509 --> 50:55.593
They're letting the old man out.

51:18.033 --> 51:21.161
Most likely gonna give him
another pasting.

52:05.456 --> 52:06.956
Good evening, colonel.

52:13.756 --> 52:16.007
Do you mind sitting over here?

52:16.884 --> 52:19.761
I am having rather a late supper.

52:42.618 --> 52:45.203
English corned beef.

52:46.121 --> 52:47.705
No, thank you.

52:52.211 --> 52:55.547
Produce of Scotland.

52:57.258 --> 52:59.509
I prefer it to sake.

53:00.010 --> 53:02.679
I spent three years in London,
you know.

53:03.138 --> 53:06.599
I studied at the London Polytechnic.

53:08.143 --> 53:09.561
Cheers.

53:09.812 --> 53:11.437
Sorry.

53:11.647 --> 53:13.481
Later, perhaps?

53:13.732 --> 53:15.358
Perhaps.

53:20.948 --> 53:23.283
I was not a good artist.

53:23.492 --> 53:25.827
My father disapproved.

53:26.078 --> 53:28.496
He felt I belonged in the army.

53:29.582 --> 53:33.293
So I changed from art
to engineering.

53:33.502 --> 53:38.089
I must tell you, Colonel Saito.

53:38.299 --> 53:42.093
I intend to make a full report
of your activities in this camp.

53:47.474 --> 53:51.227
I do not think you quite
realise my position.

53:51.729 --> 53:54.856
- I must carry out my orders.
- Oh, quite, quite.

53:55.024 --> 53:59.152
My orders are to complete the bridge
by the 12th day of May.

53:59.320 --> 54:02.155
- I have only 12 weeks more.
- No doubt.

54:02.323 --> 54:07.118
Therefore, I am compelled
to use all available personnel.

54:07.369 --> 54:10.204
But no officers, except in
an administrative capacity.

54:10.414 --> 54:14.584
But officers are working
along the entire railway.

54:14.835 --> 54:16.502
You know it. I know it.

54:16.670 --> 54:19.589
I'm not responsible
for the actions of other officers.

54:19.798 --> 54:21.299
Personally, I'm appalled.

54:21.508 --> 54:23.927
Let's not get excited.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.059
Will you have a cigar?

54:31.268 --> 54:33.269
No. Thank you.

54:35.189 --> 54:38.775
When I said all officers must work...

54:39.026 --> 54:42.445
naturally, I never meant you,
the commanding officer.

54:42.696 --> 54:46.783
My orders were only intended
for officers below...

54:46.951 --> 54:49.285
None of my officers
will do manual labour.

54:49.453 --> 54:52.747
Please! I was about to say:

54:52.957 --> 54:56.334
I've been thinking the matter over
and have decided...

54:56.543 --> 55:01.047
to put majors and above
on administrative duties...

55:01.256 --> 55:04.050
leaving only junior officers
to lend a hand.

55:04.218 --> 55:07.804
I'm afraid not. The Convention's
quite clear on that point.

55:21.402 --> 55:26.155
Do you know what will happen to me
if the bridge is not ready in time?

55:26.407 --> 55:28.074
I haven't the foggiest.

55:28.283 --> 55:30.910
I'd have to kill myself.

55:31.370 --> 55:34.080
What would you do if you were me?

55:34.581 --> 55:37.166
I suppose if I were you...

55:37.751 --> 55:40.086
I'd have to kill myself.

55:42.214 --> 55:43.506
Cheers.

55:44.758 --> 55:47.301
I warn you, colonel...

55:47.594 --> 55:52.015
if I am to die,
others will die before me.

55:52.182 --> 55:53.558
Do you understand that?

55:53.726 --> 55:56.394
- Major Clipton did mention that.
- Well?

55:56.603 --> 55:59.105
That won't solve your problem.

55:59.356 --> 56:01.774
But I'm sure we can arrive
at a proper solution.

56:02.026 --> 56:03.651
Please sit down.

56:06.864 --> 56:10.324
Now, tell me, colonel...

56:10.784 --> 56:14.328
do you agree that the first job
of an officer is command?

56:14.621 --> 56:16.456
- Of course.
- Good.

56:18.959 --> 56:20.209
Now...

56:22.796 --> 56:24.714
Take this bridge of yours.

56:25.424 --> 56:27.592
It's quite an enormous undertaking.

56:27.760 --> 56:31.888
Frankly, I have grave doubts whether
your lieutenant... What's his name?

56:32.056 --> 56:34.515
- Miura.
- Miura.

56:34.975 --> 56:38.895
Is capable of tackling
a job of such importance.

56:40.022 --> 56:44.525
On the other hand, I have officers,
Reeves and Hughes for instance...

56:45.027 --> 56:48.488
who have built bridges
all over India.

56:49.656 --> 56:51.199
The men respect them.

56:51.450 --> 56:54.994
It's essential for an officer to have
that respect, I'm sure you agree.

56:55.162 --> 56:56.954
If he loses it,
he ceases to command.

56:57.164 --> 57:00.166
And what happens then?
Demoralization and chaos.

57:00.417 --> 57:03.795
A pretty poor commander I would be
if I allowed that to happen.

57:03.962 --> 57:05.880
Perhaps you are not aware...

57:06.048 --> 57:09.300
that the bridge is now
under my personal command.

57:09.676 --> 57:13.262
Really? And may I ask,
are you satisfied with the work?

57:13.430 --> 57:15.765
- I am not!
- You've proved my point.

57:15.933 --> 57:18.309
I hate the British!

57:18.519 --> 57:21.687
You are defeated
but you have no shame.

57:21.939 --> 57:24.357
You are stubborn
but have no pride.

57:24.608 --> 57:27.276
You endure
but you have no courage.

57:27.444 --> 57:29.612
I hate the British!

57:30.697 --> 57:32.532
Pointless, going on like this.

57:32.699 --> 57:34.117
Stay there!

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.336
Stand down. Stand down!

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:25.348
Battalion, attention!

01:02:05.347 --> 01:02:08.099
Battalion, stand at ease.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.144
Please...

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:16.315
Do you know what is
the date today, colonel?

01:02:16.775 --> 01:02:18.359
I'm afraid I've lost count.

01:02:18.527 --> 01:02:21.320
It's the anniversary of
our great victory...

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.323
- Over Russia in 1905.
- Oh, yes.

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:28.577
Throughout East Asia
we are celebrating this date.

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.746
In honour of this occasion...

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:33.749
I have given your troops
a day of rest.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.167
Many thanks.

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:38.504
I am declaring a general amnesty.

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:42.216
You and your officers may
return to your quarters.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.718
As part of this amnesty...

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:50.391
it will not be necessary
for officers to do manual labour.

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:21.630
He's done it!

01:05:44.733 --> 01:05:46.984
Somebody deserves a medal, sir.

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:00.247
How many men in your party?

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:02.625
Well, I don't really know, sir.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:05.127
- You don't know?
- Sir, 12, usually.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:09.673
But, well, one of the men took sick
very suddenly this morning, sir.

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:12.301
It took three or four
to help him to the hospital.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:17.640
And... He took terrible sick, sir.

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:21.602
A corporal should always know
how many men he has under him.

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.104
Oh, yes, sir.

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:28.942
Have you a nervous affliction?
If not, stop making those faces at once.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.490
It may be funny to you,
but it's not military behaviour.

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:35.991
No, sir.

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:41.664
We must put a stop
to these demonstrations.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.457
Yes, sir.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.760
- I say, Reeves?
- Yes, sir?

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:58.514
You ever constructed a bridge
across a stream like the Kwai?

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:02.351
Yes, sir, half a dozen of them,
in Madras, Bengal...

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.561
If this were your bridge...

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.481
how would you get it under way?

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:11.235
Get it under way, sir?

01:07:11.403 --> 01:07:14.113
Well, first of all,
I wouldn't build it here.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.448
Oh, why not?

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:18.367
As I was trying to tell you...

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:22.788
the Japanese couldn't have picked
a worse location. There's no bottom.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:25.207
You see those piles?

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.084
They're sinking.

01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:33.340
Our chaps could drive those logs
till doomsday and they wouldn't hold.

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:35.634
Where would you build it?

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:39.847
Why, further downstream, sir.
Across those narrows.

01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:42.933
Then we'd have solid bedrock
on both banks.

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:47.938
Hughes, if this were your bridge,
how would you use the men?

01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:52.443
Well, sir, not the way they're doing it.
It's utter chaos, as you can see.

01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:56.530
It's a lot of uncoordinated activity.

01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:58.365
No teamwork.

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:03.162
Some of those parties are actually
working against each other.

01:08:05.457 --> 01:08:06.707
Yes.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:13.380
I tell you, gentlemen, we have
a problem on our hands.

01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:16.383
Thanks to the Japanese,
we now command a rabble.

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:19.011
There's no order, no discipline.

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:23.432
- Our task is to rebuild the battalion.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.434
Which isn't going to be easy.

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:29.270
But fortunately, we have
the means at hand. The bridge.

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.939
- The bridge, sir?
- The bridge.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:39.031
We'll teach them a lesson in Western
efficiency that will put them to shame.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:41.950
We'll show them what
the British soldier is capable of.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.870
Yes. I see your point, sir.

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:47.872
I realise how difficult
it's going to be here...

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:50.542
where you can't find
what you need.

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:53.879
- But there's the challenge.
- I beg your pardon, sir.

01:08:54.087 --> 01:08:56.590
You mean, you really want them
to build the bridge?

01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:59.468
You're not usually
so slow on the uptake, Evans.

01:08:59.676 --> 01:09:02.595
I know our men.
You've got to keep them occupied.

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:05.974
Fact is, if there weren't any work,
we'd invent some, eh, Reeves?

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:09.060
- That we would, sir.
- So we're lucky.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.814
But it's going to be a proper bridge.

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:14.191
Here again I know the men.

01:09:14.442 --> 01:09:17.444
It's essential that they
take pride in their job.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:19.279
- Right, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:22.407
Reeves, you're the key man
in this situation, as engineer.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:26.578
Tell me what you want and we'll
organise it. Can we make a go of it?

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:29.081
- We'll do our best, sir.
- Fine.

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:32.626
We must draw up our plans...

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:35.962
then arrange a conference
with Saito...

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:38.674
and set him straight.

01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:48.140
Well, I think that takes care of all
the procedural matters. Now...

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.935
Oh, yes.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:54.356
The next point is somewhat unpleasant
for all concerned, I'm afraid.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:58.235
Sorry to tell you, we feel the position
of the bridge was fixed hastily...

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:00.779
and, I have to add, incorrectly.

01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:04.700
Incorrectly?

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:06.451
Unfortunately, yes.

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:09.371
Our engineer has made
a study of the site...

01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:12.958
and has concluded that
the river bottom there is too soft.

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:15.043
Too soft?

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:17.754
Mud. All the work up to now
has been useless.

01:10:18.006 --> 01:10:21.008
- Reeves, will you carry on?
- Yes, sir.

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:22.593
Colonel, I've made tests.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.555
Those piles of yours could be hammered
below water level before they'd hold.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:29.516
That bridge would collapse
under the first train.

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:33.854
The pressure and soil resistance
figures in tons per square inch.

01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:36.565
Just a moment, Reeves,
before you get too involved.

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:39.318
Colonel, do you suppose
we could have a cup of tea?

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:56.376
Then I take it we all agree
that if we're to avoid disaster...

01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:59.254
we build a new bridge,
at the site picked by Reeves...

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:01.882
400 yards downstream.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:07.721
So let's proceed to the next point.

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:11.266
I've decided to alter
the daily work quota of our men.

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:13.226
- Alter?
- Yes, I've increased it.

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:15.979
From a yard and a half
of earth moved to two.

01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:19.024
I was sure it would meet
with your approval.

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:22.527
Major Hughes has all the facts.
Hughes, would you take over?

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.781
I've done a time study, Colonel Saito,
of the entire project.

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:29.785
As you can see, the available forces
have been badly distributed.

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:33.830
I would strongly urge we revise the
organisation of the working parties.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:39.252
Just a moment. Colonel, it would save
time if we could work during dinner.

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.964
Would it be possible
to have a meal served here?

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.382
Of course.

01:11:43.675 --> 01:11:45.258
If we...

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:48.387
- Carry on, Hughes.
- Yes, sir.

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:52.057
If we increase the number of squads
and specialise their functions...

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:57.020
I'm certain the total daily output
can be increased by 30 percent.

01:11:57.188 --> 01:12:00.482
Now, Colonel Saito,
I have one more point...

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:06.279
Now, there's another important
decision that can't be postponed.

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:08.865
As most of the British
will work on the bridge...

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:11.994
only a small number will be available
for railway work.

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:17.165
I must ask you to lend us some of your
men to reinforce the railway gang...

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:21.962
so the final stretch of track can
be completed as quickly as possible.

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:25.507
I have already given the order.

01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:28.844
We must fix the daily work quota
for your men.

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:33.056
I thought of setting it at a yard
and a half so as not to overtire them...

01:12:33.224 --> 01:12:35.976
but isn't it best
to be the same as ours?

01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:39.479
That would also create a healthy
competitive spirit.

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:44.651
I have already given the order.

01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:47.446
- We'll try to surpass that, won't we?
- Yes, sir.

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:50.657
I think that completes
the agenda for this evening.

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:54.327
Thank you, Colonel Saito,
for your kind attention.

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:57.456
And are there any other questions?

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:00.542
One question.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:03.712
Can you finish the bridge in time?

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:07.466
Frankly, the consensus of opinion
is that it's impossible.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:10.135
But we'll certainly give it a go.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:15.682
We mustn't forget we wasted a month
through an unfortunate disagreement...

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:17.768
for which I was not to blame.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.188
Is there anything else?

01:13:21.773 --> 01:13:23.065
No.

01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:27.652
Thank you. The meeting is closed.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.406
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:59.976
I hope these Japanese appreciate
what we're doing for them.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:03.939
For the moment, I'm not concerned
with their appreciation.

01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:07.484
- Good night, Clipton.
- Good night, sir.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.696
By the way, I meant to tell you...

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:14.783
there are trees in this forest
very similar to elm.

01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:18.203
And the elm piles of London Bridge
lasted 600 years.

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:22.290
- Six hundred years, Reeves?
- Yes, sir.

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:25.627
Six hundred years.

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:28.338
That would be quite something.

01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:21.141
Good morning. I'm looking for an
American named Commander Shears.

01:15:21.392 --> 01:15:24.644
- Oh, yes, down on the beach.
- Oh, thank you very much.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:33.612
Kiss!

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.323
Too many eyes.

01:15:36.616 --> 01:15:40.827
You give me powders, pills, baths,
injections, enemas...

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:42.495
when all I need is love.

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:45.498
It's true.
All you really need is love.

01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:53.465
What makes you so sure
you'll get a medical discharge?

01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:55.967
Because I'm a civilian
at heart, lover.

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:58.345
And I always follow my heart.

01:15:58.596 --> 01:15:59.888
Kiss.

01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:10.523
How's that, commander?

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:13.235
Don't call me commander.

01:16:13.444 --> 01:16:14.819
It's unromantic.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:16.821
You're an officer yourself.

01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:19.950
How would you like it
if I called you Lieutenant Lover?

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:22.661
Let's be democratic.
Just call me "sir."

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:23.995
Yes, sir.

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:27.332
Brass ahoy.

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:29.918
He wants to see you. He's all yours.

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:32.629
- I'm going for a swim.
- Don't leave me.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.840
- Commander Shears?
- Yes.

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:37.842
My name's Warden.

01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:39.886
- How do you do?
- Sorry to intrude...

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:42.514
That's okay, major.
I'm used to it by now.

01:16:42.682 --> 01:16:43.807
Like a martini?

01:16:43.975 --> 01:16:45.809
That's very kind, but I think not.

01:16:45.977 --> 01:16:47.310
- Mind if I have one?
- No.

01:16:47.478 --> 01:16:48.853
How did you get that?

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:52.023
Where there's a hospital,
there's alcohol.

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:55.151
Oh, yes, of course. Jolly good.

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:58.071
Well, I'll be as brief as possible.

01:16:58.364 --> 01:17:01.866
I belong to a rather rum group
called Force 316.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:04.577
Our headquarters is up
in the Botanical Gardens.

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:08.081
- Protecting rare plants from the enemy?
- Not quite.

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:11.167
- Sure you won't have a martini?
- No, thanks.

01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:15.380
We have a particular interest
in that railway you worked on.

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:18.925
You could give us no end
of valuable information.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:22.679
Well, I'm leaving
for the States in a few days...

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:26.057
and I've already told your people
everything I know.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:29.602
But you could help us
in a rather special sense.

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.521
I know it's a terrible imposition...

01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:34.983
but I wonder if you could possibly
come out and see us.

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:39.362
Well, if you want to go over
the whole thing again.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:42.240
Oh, that's very kind.
Lord Louis will be grateful.

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.867
- Lord who?
- Mountbatten.

01:17:44.035 --> 01:17:46.661
- We're one of his special pigeons.
- Oh, I see.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:50.373
Shall we say this evening, then?
About 8. I'll send a car for you.

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:52.917
This evening? Out of the question.

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:55.462
Well, tomorrow morning then?
About 10?

01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:58.173
- Okay, 10:00.
- Thanks very much.

01:17:58.424 --> 01:18:00.633
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.093
Good luck.

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:04.179
Thanks.

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:16.107
I know, you're terribly sorry, but you're
going to stand me up tonight.

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:18.360
You couldn't be more wrong.

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:25.408
General salute!

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:28.078
Present arms!

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:44.010
- May I see your pass, sir, please?
- Oh, yes.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.262
Thank you, sir.

01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:48.556
Carry on, driver.

01:18:56.774 --> 01:18:59.150
Major Warden's bungalow
is at the end of the path.

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:01.111
All right, thanks.

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:15.083
Good show, Jenkins. Good show!

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:18.837
Come along, Thomson.
Use your knife, man. Use your knife.

01:19:20.381 --> 01:19:24.259
Good! On your feet, chaps.
Away to the debriefing room quickly.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:27.011
Come on, move yourselves!
Move! Move quickly!

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:33.643
Very clumsy, Joyce, very clumsy.

01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:37.856
Always use your knife
immediately, Joyce.

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:40.608
You see, he's gained the initiative.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:44.737
Wait a minute!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.198
- You're sorry?
- So am I, sir.

01:19:47.408 --> 01:19:50.743
- I thought you were the enemy.
- I'm American, if that's what you mean.

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:54.914
- That'll be all, Joyce.
- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

01:19:55.749 --> 01:19:59.294
- What can I do for you, sir?
- I was on my way to see Major Warden.

01:19:59.545 --> 01:20:03.882
I'll show you the way. He'll finish
his lecture any moment now.

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:13.266
- That's the end of his lecture.
- Thunderous ovation.

01:20:13.476 --> 01:20:17.645
He believes in keeping our training
as close to real life as possible.

01:20:19.899 --> 01:20:22.233
- Major Warden, sir?
- Yes?

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:23.902
Very good of you to come.

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:26.946
- I hope they took care of you.
- They certainly have.

01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:30.200
Thank you, staff.
Well, come along, then.

01:20:30.451 --> 01:20:33.286
Colonel Green is looking forward
to meeting you.

01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:37.790
- Fascinating place, isn't it?
- Utterly charming.

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:40.001
Didn't realise it was
a commando school.

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:44.964
We're trying to discourage the use of
that word. Such a melodramatic air.

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:46.633
What do you do here?

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:49.260
Sabotage, demolition,
that line of country.

01:20:49.428 --> 01:20:52.514
We're using P.E., plastic explosives.
It's wonderful stuff.

01:20:52.765 --> 01:20:55.391
That pop was made
with a lump half this size.

01:20:55.643 --> 01:20:59.103
It's twice as powerful as gelignite
and only half the weight. Here.

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:03.316
It's quite harmless
until it's detonated.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:05.193
Thanks for telling me.

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:08.446
It's completely waterproof
and actually plastic.

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:11.449
See? You can do
what you like with it.

01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:13.952
This is my place.

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:20.833
Go ahead.

01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:25.421
Oh, I'm dying for a cup of tea.

01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:30.134
- Would you care for one?
- No, thanks.

01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:32.512
- A drink?
- No, thank you.

01:21:32.763 --> 01:21:35.848
- Pot of tea for one, please, Peter.
- Very good, sir.

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:41.145
Do you read this?

01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:45.233
Oh, I taught Oriental languages
at Cambridge before the war.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:52.740
I never congratulated you
on your escape. It was a good show.

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:56.869
I was lucky. If your sea-rescue plane
hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.

01:21:57.037 --> 01:21:58.788
No, I suppose not.

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:04.669
Would you like to see
where you were?

01:22:05.713 --> 01:22:07.297
All right.

01:22:08.215 --> 01:22:11.759
Our information's rather scanty.
It's mostly based on your report.

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.803
But we think the camp is about here.

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:18.516
Say, do your people have any idea
what happened to Colonel Nicholson?

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:22.270
He had guts. They were about to
shoot him and he didn't bat an eye.

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:25.607
If you're about to be shot
there's not much you can do.

01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:30.361
Here is the River Kwai, and here is
the village where you were helped.

01:22:30.529 --> 01:22:32.196
And here is the railway.

01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:35.074
But then you must be fairly familiar
with all this area.

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.869
Not really, I was out of my head
half the time.

01:22:38.037 --> 01:22:41.706
The railway starts down here
in Singapore. Malaya...

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:46.794
Bangkok, Rangoon. Their idea
is to drive on through, into India.

01:22:47.046 --> 01:22:50.506
- Where was I picked up?
- Oh, about here.

01:22:50.758 --> 01:22:55.720
The Japanese aim to open the Bangkok-
Rangoon section by the middle of May.

01:22:55.929 --> 01:22:58.056
Naturally, we'll try to prevent them.

01:22:58.223 --> 01:23:01.142
It's too far for bombers
to carry an adequate load.

01:23:01.352 --> 01:23:03.728
We'll have to go smash it
on the ground.

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:06.564
- How will you get there?
- Parachute drop, then march.

01:23:06.774 --> 01:23:09.734
With demolition equipment
through that jungle?

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:14.322
Our chief problem
is lack of firsthand knowledge.

01:23:14.573 --> 01:23:17.116
You see, none of us have
ever been there.

01:23:17.368 --> 01:23:20.578
- I don't want to discourage...
- It should be interesting.

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:22.705
Colonel Green's given me
the Kwai bridge.

01:23:22.873 --> 01:23:25.750
I'm gonna take a team in
and blow it up.

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.044
Lucky you.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.256
Sure you won't have tea?

01:23:32.424 --> 01:23:37.053
No, thanks. I don't want to be rude,
but I've got a luncheon date at 2.

01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:40.973
- So if there are any questions...
- Of course, I'm sorry.

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:46.813
Well, there is only
one question, actually.

01:23:47.272 --> 01:23:49.524
How would you feel
about going back?

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:52.819
Come again?

01:23:53.987 --> 01:23:56.698
I know, under the circumstances,
it's a bit much...

01:23:56.907 --> 01:24:00.076
but you have a unique
knowledge for our purpose.

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:02.120
And we'd love to have you with us.

01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:06.457
That's why you brought me here?

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:08.209
To ask me this?

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:10.169
Well, frankly, yes.

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:13.631
Major, I just got out of there.
My escape was a miracle.

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:16.426
Now you want me to go back?
Don't be ridiculous!

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:17.927
This is embarrassing...

01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:21.848
I can't go back! I don't belong to you.
I belong to the American Navy.

01:24:22.099 --> 01:24:26.018
Actually, Colonel Green has taken
the matter up with your people.

01:24:26.228 --> 01:24:30.064
- With my people?
- Your Navy's turned you over to us.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:34.068
A signal arrived yesterday morning
from your CINC Pacific...

01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:38.364
authorising your temporary transfer
of duty to Force 316.

01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:41.409
- They can't do this to me.
- I'm afraid they have.

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:44.495
It was difficult to know how
to break it to you.

01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:49.167
But they can't do this to me.
I mean it. My Navy's made a mistake.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:57.091
Look. I'm not a Navy commander.
I'm not even an officer.

01:24:57.384 --> 01:25:02.513
The whole thing's a fake. I'm just
an ordinary swab jockey, second class.

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:09.103
When the Houston sunk, I made
it ashore with a real commander.

01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:12.523
Later on, we ran into
a Japanese patrol. He was killed.

01:25:12.733 --> 01:25:16.152
I figured it was just a matter of time
before I was captured...

01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:19.197
So you changed uniforms
with a dead man.

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:22.116
I thought officers would get
better treatment.

01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:23.451
That's very sensible.

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:27.205
But at Saito's camp, the officers
worked along with the rest.

01:25:27.456 --> 01:25:29.999
Yes, there's always the unexpected,
isn't there?

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:35.505
I kind of got used
to being a commander...

01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:39.050
so when I arrived here
at the hospital...

01:25:39.218 --> 01:25:43.387
I took a look at the enlisted men's
ward and then the officer's ward...

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:48.226
and I said to myself,
"Let's let it ride along for a while."

01:25:48.477 --> 01:25:50.186
There were certain advantages.

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:52.271
I saw one of them on the beach.

01:25:53.190 --> 01:25:54.732
Anyway, that's the whole story.

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:58.903
The point is, you can't use me.
You want an officer...

01:25:59.112 --> 01:26:01.989
an American commander
named Shears who doesn't exist.

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:04.408
When the Navy learns the truth,
they'll say:

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:07.745
"Ship him home in irons
for impersonating an officer."

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:11.541
- Once that happens, I've got it made.
- Got it what?

01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:15.002
- Made. I'd like that drink now.
- Of course.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:17.755
I'll apply for a medical discharge.

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.132
I'll tell them
I impersonated an officer...

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.927
because I went off my rocker
in the jungle.

01:26:24.429 --> 01:26:28.224
I'm getting worse, you know.
Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.

01:26:28.976 --> 01:26:30.685
It's quite a clever plan.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:34.021
It's not only clever, it's foolproof.

01:26:34.273 --> 01:26:36.607
If my Navy finds out who I am...

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:40.862
those temporary orders won't be
worth the paper they're written on.

01:26:54.585 --> 01:26:56.460
This is your photograph, isn't it?

01:26:59.464 --> 01:27:02.174
- Where did you get this?
- It took a bit of doing...

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:04.844
because your people
couldn't identify you.

01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:09.891
Finally your CINC Pacific
sent us a copy of your service record.

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:14.145
The photograph, fingerprints.
Would you care to have a look?

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:15.980
No.

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:20.484
You see, we've known about
your actual rank for nearly a week.

01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:25.990
Your Navy's in an awkward position.

01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:28.409
In one sense you're a blasted hero...

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:31.329
for making an escape
from the jungle.

01:27:31.538 --> 01:27:34.498
But at the same time,
they can't bring you home...

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:38.210
and give you the Navy Cross
for impersonating an officer.

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:41.797
I suppose that's why they were
so happy to hand you over to us.

01:27:42.049 --> 01:27:43.633
You see?

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:45.009
Hot potato.

01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:48.220
As far as your present rank
is concerned...

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:51.599
we're fairly informal
about those things in Force 316.

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:54.226
You'd have the simulated
rank of major.

01:27:55.604 --> 01:27:59.273
Simulated major. That figures.

01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:02.193
Well...

01:28:05.864 --> 01:28:08.824
As long as I'm hooked,
I might as well volunteer.

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:11.035
Good show!

01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:14.205
Oh, Colonel Green, sir.

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:19.752
This is Major Shears. He volunteered
to go and help me blow up the bridge.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.379
Really?

01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:24.131
Good show!

01:28:24.383 --> 01:28:27.218
Jolly good show, major!

01:29:16.643 --> 01:29:19.437
Get up to sick bay, Baker.
This foot's infected.

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:21.814
The colonel might think
I'm malingering.

01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:24.775
I'm the medical officer, Baker.
Get cracking.

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:34.452
Will someone tell me why the old man
wants us to build a proper bridge?

01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:38.122
Don't you worry about old Nick.
He knows what he's doing.

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:52.720
Hello, Clipton.
About time you paid us a visit.

01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:55.556
Fine job our chaps are doing.
First-rate.

01:29:55.807 --> 01:29:58.142
Yes. How's he behaving?

01:29:58.393 --> 01:30:01.145
He's been most reasonable
since we took over.

01:30:01.354 --> 01:30:04.231
- I wonder what he's thinking.
- I haven't the foggiest.

01:30:04.483 --> 01:30:06.484
- Thanks, Reeves.
- Right, sir.

01:30:07.194 --> 01:30:08.569
What do you think?

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.156
Quite a challenge, isn't it?

01:30:14.284 --> 01:30:18.662
Sir, are you convinced that
building this bridge is a good idea?

01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:20.539
- Are you serious?
- Yes, sir.

01:30:20.707 --> 01:30:24.418
A good idea? Take another look.

01:30:25.337 --> 01:30:29.256
You don't agree morale is high?
Discipline has been restored?

01:30:29.508 --> 01:30:31.550
Their condition has been improved?

01:30:31.718 --> 01:30:34.428
- Are they a happier lot or aren't they?
- Yes, sir, but...

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:37.264
They feed better
and they are no longer abused.

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:39.016
- That's all true.
- Well, then.

01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:42.520
Honestly, Clipton, there are times
when I don't understand you at all.

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:44.647
I'll try to make myself clear, sir.

01:30:44.815 --> 01:30:48.692
The fact is, what we're doing
could be construed as...

01:30:48.902 --> 01:30:51.946
forgive me, sir,
collaboration with the enemy.

01:30:52.114 --> 01:30:53.864
Perhaps even as
treasonable activity.

01:30:54.032 --> 01:30:58.119
We're prisoners of war.
We haven't the right to refuse to work.

01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:01.580
I understand that, sir.
But must we work so well?

01:31:01.748 --> 01:31:05.334
Must we build them a better bridge
than they could have themselves?

01:31:05.919 --> 01:31:10.297
If you had to operate on Saito,
would you do your best or let him die?

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:14.176
Would you prefer
we disintegrate in idleness?

01:31:14.344 --> 01:31:17.221
Would you have it said that
our chaps can't do a proper job?

01:31:17.389 --> 01:31:22.393
It's important to show these people
they can't break us in body or in spirit.

01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:24.895
Take a good look, Clipton.

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:27.815
One day the war will be over.

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:31.402
I hope that the people who use
this bridge in years to come...

01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:34.738
will remember how it was built,
and who built it.

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:40.327
Not a gang of slaves, but soldiers.
British soldiers, even in captivity.

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:42.872
- Yes, sir.
- You're a fine doctor...

01:31:43.123 --> 01:31:45.958
but you've a lot to learn
about the army.

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:11.275
Hold him! Hold him!

01:32:11.484 --> 01:32:15.571
Use your boot!
Get your boot in there, will you?

01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:24.330
Good morning.

01:32:38.053 --> 01:32:40.429
What on earth
are you people staring at?

01:32:40.597 --> 01:32:42.723
Get on with your jobs!

01:32:43.975 --> 01:32:45.809
Now get him with your boot!

01:32:58.406 --> 01:32:59.949
I'm awfully sorry I'm late, sir.

01:33:00.116 --> 01:33:03.994
Four minutes late, to be exact.
You were in need of medical attention?

01:33:04.162 --> 01:33:06.872
- Sir?
- I was referring to the nurse.

01:33:07.707 --> 01:33:10.542
Oh, yes, very ingenious.
Warden was right.

01:33:10.710 --> 01:33:12.086
Sit down.

01:33:12.837 --> 01:33:17.132
I asked you here to help us pick
the fourth member of your team.

01:33:17.384 --> 01:33:20.052
- Ask Mr. Joyce to come in.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:20.637 --> 01:33:23.472
Chapman here wants Joyce,
but I have my doubts about him.

01:33:23.723 --> 01:33:27.518
I think he has too much imagination
as distinct from cold calculation.

01:33:27.686 --> 01:33:28.936
As I've told you before...

01:33:29.104 --> 01:33:33.482
in this job, even when it's finished
there's always one more thing to do.

01:33:33.733 --> 01:33:36.110
He's the best swimmer
in the school, sir.

01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:40.656
I'm well aware of your evaluation.
The opinion I want is Shears'.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.078
All right, at ease.

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:54.503
These gentlemen are thinking of
taking you for a hike into the jungle.

01:33:54.754 --> 01:33:56.088
Yes, sir.

01:33:56.756 --> 01:33:59.008
You were an accountant in Montreal?

01:33:59.259 --> 01:34:01.427
Yes, sir.
Not really an accountant, sir.

01:34:01.678 --> 01:34:03.804
That is, I didn't have my charter.

01:34:04.014 --> 01:34:05.431
Exactly what did you do?

01:34:05.682 --> 01:34:09.643
Well, sir, I just checked columns
and columns of figures...

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:12.396
which people had checked
before me...

01:34:12.564 --> 01:34:16.025
and then other people checked them
after I had checked them.

01:34:16.276 --> 01:34:19.528
- Sounds a frightful bore.
- Sir, it was a frightful bore.

01:34:19.696 --> 01:34:21.363
How did you happen
to wind up here?

01:34:21.531 --> 01:34:24.074
In '39 I came over to London
to enlist.

01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:26.785
About two years later
I volunteered for this work.

01:34:26.953 --> 01:34:30.664
- You volunteered!
- Yes, sir. See, the regular army...

01:34:30.915 --> 01:34:32.541
Go ahead, you can be frank.

01:34:32.959 --> 01:34:38.047
Well, the regular army reminded me
of my job in civilian life.

01:34:38.298 --> 01:34:40.507
They don't expect you to think.

01:34:42.802 --> 01:34:44.470
Think about this.

01:34:44.763 --> 01:34:47.723
Are you quite sure you'd be able
to use it in cold blood?

01:34:48.183 --> 01:34:49.475
I know how to use it, sir.

01:34:49.726 --> 01:34:53.729
That's not what I meant.
Could you use it in cold blood?

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:56.357
Could you kill without hesitation?

01:34:57.442 --> 01:35:02.529
That's a question I've often asked
myself, sir. It's worried me quite a bit.

01:35:02.989 --> 01:35:04.698
And what was the answer?

01:35:05.116 --> 01:35:07.201
I don't honestly know, sir.

01:35:07.952 --> 01:35:10.537
I've tried to imagine myself...

01:35:12.374 --> 01:35:16.377
I suppose I find it hard to kid myself
that killing isn't a crime.

01:35:17.087 --> 01:35:19.046
It's an old army problem.

01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:22.841
Well, I think that's all.
Thank you, Joyce.

01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:26.887
Am I to go with the team, sir?

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:29.681
We'll let you know.

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:38.482
You see what I mean.

01:35:38.691 --> 01:35:40.609
Well, at least he was honest.

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:45.364
None of us ever know the answer to
that question until the moment arises.

01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:47.157
What's your opinion, Shears?

01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:50.077
Well, sir, he's Canadian.

01:35:50.286 --> 01:35:54.498
And that's in keeping with the
international composition of this outfit.

01:35:54.833 --> 01:35:57.167
If he wants to go,
he can even take my place.

01:35:58.002 --> 01:36:01.505
Well, if you're all agreed on Joyce,
he's yours.

01:36:02.173 --> 01:36:05.259
I had a report from air reconnaissance
on that village.

01:36:05.427 --> 01:36:08.429
There's sufficient clearing
to make your jump at last light.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:11.890
- You've had parachute training?
- No, sir.

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.810
Blast. This is awkward.

01:36:15.061 --> 01:36:17.271
Silly, it never occurred to me.

01:36:17.814 --> 01:36:18.897
Well, maybe...

01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:22.067
He's right.
Arrange some practice jumps for him.

01:36:22.318 --> 01:36:24.194
I'll pop over
and check right away.

01:36:24.446 --> 01:36:27.531
- All right, Chapman, you can run along.
- Yes, sir.

01:36:29.826 --> 01:36:32.119
Well, feel like a sniff of air?

01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:33.745
Yes, sir.

01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:36.665
You don't realise what a plum
you are for us.

01:36:36.916 --> 01:36:40.419
Your knowledge of the area,
making friends in that village.

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:44.798
It's almost as if your whole escape
had been planned with us in mind.

01:36:47.594 --> 01:36:52.097
By the way, here's something
that'll interest you. The new I pill.

01:36:53.141 --> 01:36:56.685
- L pill?
- L for lethal. Instantaneous, painless.

01:36:56.895 --> 01:37:00.230
Much better than the old ones.
For capture, of course.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.983
You're telling me
not to be taken alive.

01:37:03.234 --> 01:37:05.068
I wouldn't recommend it.

01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:09.740
If any of you get hurt or wounded the
others will have to leave him behind.

01:37:09.991 --> 01:37:12.326
The objective comes first
in our work.

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:15.370
You want my honest evaluation
of this team?

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:17.664
I didn't want to speak out
in front of them.

01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:19.625
I understand, go ahead.

01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:24.338
Well, Chapman will be fine.
Ice water in his veins.

01:37:24.589 --> 01:37:27.341
Joyce is... He'll be okay.

01:37:27.592 --> 01:37:30.260
- It's Warden I don't get.
- Oh, why not?

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:32.221
Cambridge don and all of that.

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:36.016
It's one thing to play with explosives
like a kid with firecrackers...

01:37:36.267 --> 01:37:38.602
He's not without experience,
you know.

01:37:39.479 --> 01:37:43.440
When we lost Singapore, he stayed
behind to blow up a couple of bridges.

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:46.401
And many other installations
before the Japs caught him.

01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:47.611
- Caught him?
- Yes.

01:37:47.779 --> 01:37:50.697
- Fascinating story. He...
- Sir, it's most annoying.

01:37:50.949 --> 01:37:55.494
In view of time, they don't think
practice jumps would be worthwhile.

01:37:55.662 --> 01:37:57.371
- No?
- If you make one jump...

01:37:57.539 --> 01:37:59.790
you've only got 50 percent
chance of injury.

01:37:59.958 --> 01:38:03.544
Two jumps, 80 percent. Three jumps,
you're bound to get your packet.

01:38:03.795 --> 01:38:07.714
The consensus is, the most sensible
thing for Major Shears to do...

01:38:07.924 --> 01:38:10.926
is to go ahead and jump
and hope for the best.

01:38:11.177 --> 01:38:13.220
With or without parachute?

01:38:18.309 --> 01:38:20.519
Oh, very good!

01:38:24.148 --> 01:38:25.732
With or without!

01:39:22.915 --> 01:39:23.957
He's in the trees!

01:40:02.955 --> 01:40:05.624
Yai says we can't reach
the Kwai by the route you took.

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:10.253
There are too many Japanese patrols.
We'll swing north through heavy jungle.

01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:12.631
- Who's gonna lead the way?
- Yai himself.

01:40:12.799 --> 01:40:15.342
He hates the Japanese.
They took all his men.

01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:18.345
Which means we shall have to
use women bearers.

01:40:18.513 --> 01:40:21.056
- Women bearers.
- They're very capable, I'm told.

01:40:32.568 --> 01:40:35.654
He says it's dangerous
to spend the night in the village.

01:40:35.905 --> 01:40:40.075
There's an enemy post three miles away
so we'll have to sleep in the jungle.

01:40:40.326 --> 01:40:45.038
- What about Chapman?
- Yai will bury him and his chute.

01:40:45.289 --> 01:40:46.915
Is there something wrong?

01:40:48.042 --> 01:40:52.796
I was just thinking.
You speak Yai's language. I don't.

01:40:53.047 --> 01:40:57.050
He's gonna lead you back to the river
by a route I never took.

01:40:57.301 --> 01:41:00.929
Will someone tell me why
I'm so indispensable to this outfit?

01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:05.475
I know how you feel, but there's
always the unexpected, isn't there?

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:07.811
Tell that to Chapman.

01:41:08.062 --> 01:41:09.646
Let's get cracking.

01:44:13.581 --> 01:44:15.248
You're lovely.

01:44:17.793 --> 01:44:19.044
Lovely.

01:44:19.295 --> 01:44:21.504
Be happy in your work.

01:44:21.797 --> 01:44:23.006
Yes, sir.

01:44:50.368 --> 01:44:53.828
Leeches.

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:13.223
She's telling you to hold still.
She'll take the leeches off your back.

01:45:13.391 --> 01:45:16.017
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

01:45:16.185 --> 01:45:18.687
I'll teach you to say that in Siamese.

01:45:18.938 --> 01:45:22.440
No, that would spoil it.
Too much talk always spoils it.

01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:24.192
What's wrong with that thing?

01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:28.029
It's taken an awful beating.
I can't get a strong signal.

01:45:28.197 --> 01:45:29.531
I'll tell you what's wrong.

01:45:29.699 --> 01:45:33.660
It's wet, mildewed, corroded, rotten.
Like everything else in this jungle.

01:45:33.828 --> 01:45:35.578
You might as well dump it!

01:45:40.626 --> 01:45:42.836
This is Radio Tokyo signing off.

01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:47.590
This is your friendliest enemy
reminding you to take it easy...

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.343
and never volunteer for anything.

01:46:03.524 --> 01:46:05.608
If we stay, we'll be up to our necks.

01:46:05.776 --> 01:46:08.111
- I've got it all decoded, sir.
- Read it.

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.157
Yes, sir. "One, original
bridge works reported abandoned."

01:46:12.366 --> 01:46:14.993
New construction downstream
from first site.

01:46:15.244 --> 01:46:19.330
Two, enemy intends to open railway
with passage of special train...

01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:22.500
Bangkok for Rangoon
with troops and V.l.P.

01:46:22.752 --> 01:46:25.378
Estimated to arrive target, a.m. 13th.

01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:28.757
Three, synchronize demolition
with passage this train.

01:46:28.924 --> 01:46:32.135
Four, good hunting. Have fun."
That's all, sir.

01:46:32.386 --> 01:46:34.095
A train and a bridge!

01:46:34.263 --> 01:46:36.681
Yes, sir.
Can we get there in time, sir?

01:46:36.849 --> 01:46:39.434
Yai says we're two to three days'
march from the Kwai.

01:46:39.643 --> 01:46:43.646
If we set a faster pace, we could
make it before sundown on the 12th.

01:46:43.898 --> 01:46:45.815
It's worth it for the train.

01:46:46.067 --> 01:46:49.360
Oh, by all means. Good hunting.
Good show.

01:46:49.570 --> 01:46:51.571
Jolly good fun. Jolly, jolly good.

01:46:52.698 --> 01:46:56.159
If you hadn't fixed the radio,
we wouldn't know about the train.

01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:59.162
Well, there's always the unexpected,
isn't there?

01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.042
Heave!

01:47:04.210 --> 01:47:07.921
Heave! Heave!

01:47:24.313 --> 01:47:26.815
- Half a pint, sir.
- Quinine.

01:47:28.526 --> 01:47:31.194
Well, we'll complete this later.

01:47:32.071 --> 01:47:35.573
- Clipton, we're facing a crisis.
- Yes, sir?

01:47:36.575 --> 01:47:40.703
I spoke with Reeves and Hughes.
We won't finish the bridge on time.

01:47:40.871 --> 01:47:42.497
We just haven't the manpower.

01:47:42.706 --> 01:47:46.000
I've asked the officers to lend a hand,
but even that won't do it.

01:47:46.210 --> 01:47:47.836
The officers are going to work?

01:47:48.087 --> 01:47:51.840
I explained the situation and they
volunteered, but it's not enough.

01:47:52.007 --> 01:47:53.842
Why not ask Saito
for some of his men?

01:47:54.009 --> 01:47:57.178
This is our show. We must
make the most of our resources.

01:47:57.346 --> 01:48:00.223
That's what I came to talk
to you about. The sick list.

01:48:00.474 --> 01:48:04.185
There's not a man in this hospital
who doesn't belong there.

01:48:04.353 --> 01:48:06.813
Don't jump to conclusions.
No reflection on you...

01:48:06.981 --> 01:48:09.232
but there are always
a few malingerers.

01:48:09.441 --> 01:48:11.860
Be honest. Keep an open mind
is all I ask.

01:48:12.111 --> 01:48:13.945
Come along, let's see.

01:48:15.406 --> 01:48:17.282
Don't move, don't move.

01:48:21.078 --> 01:48:22.745
What's the matter with Haskins?

01:48:22.913 --> 01:48:26.624
He's got amoebic dysentery and
blackwater fever. Temperature of 104.

01:48:26.792 --> 01:48:28.334
Right. I see.

01:48:31.422 --> 01:48:32.630
And this man?

01:48:32.882 --> 01:48:36.843
Leg ulcers. I may be able to save
the leg if I do more cutting tonight.

01:48:37.011 --> 01:48:39.053
Really want to send him
out to work, sir?

01:48:39.263 --> 01:48:41.055
Don't talk rot, Clipton.

01:48:45.436 --> 01:48:48.062
- And that man there?
- His arm's infected.

01:48:48.272 --> 01:48:50.565
Most of their wounds
won't heal properly.

01:48:50.774 --> 01:48:53.484
I wonder, in his case,
if fresh air and light duties...

01:48:53.652 --> 01:48:55.778
might do more good
than being cooped up.

01:48:55.946 --> 01:48:58.948
- Light duties?
- It's not our policy to keep a man...

01:48:59.116 --> 01:49:01.743
- Just because he scratched his arm.
- Not our policy?

01:49:01.911 --> 01:49:03.161
Well, is it?

01:49:03.329 --> 01:49:07.373
A man may not be on top of his form,
but he can still make himself useful.

01:49:07.541 --> 01:49:11.211
Trimmings and finishing jobs.
Stand easy, Baker.

01:49:11.462 --> 01:49:15.048
Tell me, you feel up to doing
a little light work on the bridge?

01:49:16.675 --> 01:49:19.219
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good show.

01:49:20.304 --> 01:49:22.013
What about you? Nothing difficult.

01:49:22.181 --> 01:49:24.641
- I'll try, sir.
- Good man.

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:31.189
Now, look here, men. It goes
without saying I'm proud of all of you.

01:49:31.357 --> 01:49:35.944
But we're facing a crisis.
For those of you who feel up to it...

01:49:36.195 --> 01:49:40.323
how about lending us a hand?
Fetch and carry, paint here and there?

01:49:40.532 --> 01:49:41.950
What do you say?

01:49:42.159 --> 01:49:45.828
- Yes, sir.
- Good show. Come on, follow me.

01:51:28.349 --> 01:51:29.432
Ten minutes.

01:53:27.426 --> 01:53:29.302
Make sure they're all dead.

01:53:32.764 --> 01:53:34.140
Come on, Joyce.

01:53:36.351 --> 01:53:38.978
Use your knife, man,
or we'll be shooting each other.

01:53:51.283 --> 01:53:52.950
Go that way, Joyce.

01:56:01.371 --> 01:56:04.206
I could have done it. I was ready.

01:56:08.712 --> 01:56:10.087
Are you hit, sir?

01:56:10.464 --> 01:56:11.756
Let's go.

01:56:33.111 --> 01:56:36.864
It's superficial. Maybe a chipped bone,
but there's nothing broken.

01:56:37.032 --> 01:56:39.200
- It's my fault, sir.
- Oh, shut up, Joyce.

01:56:39.368 --> 01:56:41.786
I can walk on it.
That's all that counts.

01:56:41.953 --> 01:56:43.913
Yeah, but how far and how fast?

01:56:44.122 --> 01:56:46.791
We won't know that
till I've tried it, will we?

01:59:59.276 --> 02:00:00.943
What are you doing?

02:00:01.444 --> 02:00:03.487
I didn't give orders for a halt.

02:00:03.697 --> 02:00:05.155
We all need it.

02:00:09.244 --> 02:00:12.788
We're still five hours' fast march
from the objective.

02:00:12.998 --> 02:00:14.331
Maybe six.

02:00:15.375 --> 02:00:16.542
Come on.

02:00:16.710 --> 02:00:19.295
You keep walking on that foot,
you'll bleed to death.

02:00:20.672 --> 02:00:22.214
Yeah.

02:00:26.887 --> 02:00:29.972
- You're gonna leave me here.
- If you stop, we stop.

02:00:30.849 --> 02:00:33.475
You can't study the layout
of the bridge after dark.

02:00:33.685 --> 02:00:35.811
You've got to get there
before sundown.

02:00:36.021 --> 02:00:40.691
But, sir, when the job's done, who
knows if we can return by this route...

02:00:40.984 --> 02:00:43.068
or whether we could find you
if we did?

02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:46.864
If you were me, I wouldn't hesitate
to leave you and you know that.

02:00:47.115 --> 02:00:48.616
He doesn't know it, but I do.

02:00:48.783 --> 02:00:52.244
You'd leave your own mother here
if the rules called for it.

02:00:52.996 --> 02:00:56.415
You'll go on without me.
That's an order.

02:00:56.625 --> 02:00:58.918
You're in command now, Shears.

02:01:01.671 --> 02:01:03.505
I won't obey that order.

02:01:03.882 --> 02:01:05.633
You make me sick with your heroics.

02:01:05.842 --> 02:01:08.636
You carry the stench of death
like the plague.

02:01:08.887 --> 02:01:11.096
Explosives and I pills
go well together.

02:01:11.348 --> 02:01:15.017
It's one thing or the other.
Destroy a bridge or destroy yourself.

02:01:15.268 --> 02:01:17.019
This is just a game, this war.

02:01:17.228 --> 02:01:21.148
You and that Colonel Nicholson,
you're crazy with courage. For what?

02:01:21.399 --> 02:01:24.360
How to die like a gentleman,
how to die by the rules...

02:01:24.569 --> 02:01:28.322
when the only important thing
is how to live like a human being!

02:01:32.327 --> 02:01:35.204
I'm not gonna leave you
here to die, Warden...

02:01:36.539 --> 02:01:40.417
because I don't care about
your bridge or about your rules.

02:01:40.877 --> 02:01:43.545
If we go on, we go on together.

02:01:46.466 --> 02:01:48.133
Good old Yai.

02:02:00.105 --> 02:02:01.271
I'm all right.

02:02:11.950 --> 02:02:13.242
Come on.

02:03:02.751 --> 02:03:04.209
Let's get closer.

02:03:23.730 --> 02:03:25.939
Still sorry we brought you along?

02:03:27.650 --> 02:03:29.526
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

02:03:29.736 --> 02:03:31.987
You're in command again now,
you know.

02:03:32.197 --> 02:03:33.864
Thank you, major.

02:03:34.741 --> 02:03:39.745
I can't understand it.
It's such a solid, well-designed job.

02:03:42.332 --> 02:03:45.334
Not like the bridges
the enemy usually throws together.

02:03:45.668 --> 02:03:46.919
Look.

02:03:48.755 --> 02:03:50.798
Those poor devils down there.

02:03:51.049 --> 02:03:54.885
Imagine being forced to build that
in the condition they must be in.

02:03:56.012 --> 02:03:59.014
They've got a British officer
working on his knees.

02:03:59.265 --> 02:04:01.350
The Japanese seem
to be enjoying it too.

02:04:02.519 --> 02:04:05.687
If he knew we were here,
it might boost his morale a little.

02:04:24.833 --> 02:04:28.210
If not for the train, we could
set a time fuse and be miles away.

02:04:28.419 --> 02:04:31.255
Since we don't know
what time it'll cross tomorrow...

02:04:31.506 --> 02:04:33.757
we'll have to do the job manually.

02:04:34.384 --> 02:04:37.136
We'll set the charges
against the piles...

02:04:37.387 --> 02:04:40.889
about three feet under the water,
I should think...

02:04:41.141 --> 02:04:44.476
and run the main wire
downstream to the plunger.

02:04:45.728 --> 02:04:48.564
The problem is where to hide it.

02:04:53.653 --> 02:04:56.780
Our side of the river is quite
obviously used by the Japanese.

02:04:57.115 --> 02:04:58.991
They'd spot it at once.

02:05:02.829 --> 02:05:05.998
Look. Do you see
those fallen tree trunks?

02:05:06.166 --> 02:05:09.543
And the grey rock just below them
on that little beach?

02:05:10.128 --> 02:05:13.630
- Yes, sir, I see them.
- That's our key position.

02:05:14.465 --> 02:05:16.341
It's on the wrong side of the river...

02:05:16.509 --> 02:05:20.095
but it's the only hiding place
within feasible distance.

02:05:21.556 --> 02:05:23.640
As soon as the bridge goes up...

02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:26.977
whoever's there
will have to swim back.

02:05:27.187 --> 02:05:29.229
It's not likely to be a pleasant swim.

02:05:29.397 --> 02:05:31.982
Sir, I was the best swimmer
in my course.

02:05:32.150 --> 02:05:33.692
Yeah.

02:05:34.861 --> 02:05:37.112
It looks like
your line of country, then.

02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:38.322
Thank you, sir.

02:05:38.489 --> 02:05:42.326
Shears, pick a spot on our side
of the bank where you can cover Joyce.

02:05:42.577 --> 02:05:45.495
Yai will be with you
so you can occupy the Nips...

02:05:45.705 --> 02:05:47.956
- If they make any trouble for Joyce.
- Right.

02:05:48.124 --> 02:05:50.667
On the theory that
there's always one more thing...

02:05:50.835 --> 02:05:55.297
I'll set up the mortar here
to create an additional diversion.

02:05:55.506 --> 02:05:58.884
Perhaps I might even take
a few potshots at the train.

02:05:59.135 --> 02:06:00.385
All clear?

02:06:00.637 --> 02:06:03.931
Any questions?
Right, we'll start as soon as it's dark.

02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:06.975
They're sure to have
sentries on the bridge...

02:06:07.185 --> 02:06:11.021
so you'll have to float
the stuff down from upriver...

02:06:11.314 --> 02:06:13.023
which means building a raft.

02:06:13.191 --> 02:06:14.358
Yai.

02:06:19.197 --> 02:06:21.740
Yai will take three women
to help you build the raft.

02:06:21.908 --> 02:06:25.160
One will stay here with me.
All right, now get cracking.

02:06:27.914 --> 02:06:29.498
Shears.

02:06:30.208 --> 02:06:33.669
You know, if it wasn't for my ankle,
I'd take Joyce's assignment.

02:06:33.836 --> 02:06:35.170
I know.

02:06:35.338 --> 02:06:37.256
You think he'll be all right?

02:06:37.548 --> 02:06:39.967
I think so. Want me to handle it?

02:06:40.551 --> 02:06:43.512
I'd let you stay up here
with the mortar if I could.

02:06:43.930 --> 02:06:45.389
I'm sorry.

02:06:46.099 --> 02:06:48.767
When it's over, I hope you get
that medical discharge...

02:06:48.935 --> 02:06:50.727
and not the hard way.

02:06:50.895 --> 02:06:52.271
Thanks.

02:07:30.268 --> 02:07:31.476
Load.

02:08:37.293 --> 02:08:38.585
Beautiful.

02:08:39.337 --> 02:08:41.004
Yes, beautiful.

02:08:41.297 --> 02:08:43.090
A first-rate job.

02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:46.009
I had no idea it would
turn out so well.

02:08:49.472 --> 02:08:51.139
Yes.

02:08:51.391 --> 02:08:53.725
A beautiful creation.

02:08:54.977 --> 02:08:56.478
I've been thinking.

02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:02.067
Tomorrow it will be 28 years to
the day that I've been in the service.

02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:04.986
Twenty-eight years in peace and war.

02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:09.991
I haven't been at home more
than 10 months in all that time.

02:09:10.576 --> 02:09:12.911
Still, it's been a good life.

02:09:14.247 --> 02:09:16.373
I love India.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.210
I wouldn't have had it any other way.

02:09:21.879 --> 02:09:23.588
But there are times...

02:09:25.258 --> 02:09:29.594
when suddenly you realise you are
nearer the end than the beginning.

02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:32.139
And you wonder...

02:09:33.808 --> 02:09:35.851
You ask yourself...

02:09:37.186 --> 02:09:40.439
what the sum total
of your life represents...

02:09:41.232 --> 02:09:44.818
what difference your being there
at any time made to anything...

02:09:45.319 --> 02:09:47.946
or if it made any difference
at all, really.

02:09:49.574 --> 02:09:52.951
Particularly in comparison
with other men's careers.

02:09:53.536 --> 02:09:56.121
I don't know whether that
kind of thinking's healthy...

02:09:56.706 --> 02:10:00.292
but I must admit I've had
some thoughts on those lines...

02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:02.752
from time to time.

02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:07.549
But tonight...

02:10:09.051 --> 02:10:10.051
Tonight...

02:10:13.806 --> 02:10:15.265
Blast.

02:10:22.190 --> 02:10:23.648
I must be off.

02:10:26.486 --> 02:10:29.863
The men are preparing
some sort of entertainment.

02:11:16.744 --> 02:11:18.036
Lovely.

02:18:30.218 --> 02:18:32.053
I'm sure I speak for all of us...

02:18:32.262 --> 02:18:35.348
when I say this has been
a most enjoyable evening.

02:18:37.101 --> 02:18:39.352
As you know,
most of you move on tomorrow...

02:18:39.561 --> 02:18:42.230
to a new camp
and new construction.

02:18:42.690 --> 02:18:47.026
It's a pity you won't be here to see
the first practical use of this bridge.

02:18:47.193 --> 02:18:50.029
However, you'll be glad to know
that the completion...

02:18:50.197 --> 02:18:52.406
of this link in the railway...

02:18:52.616 --> 02:18:55.994
will enable us to transport
the sick and disabled...

02:18:56.245 --> 02:18:59.330
to the new camp by train.

02:19:00.958 --> 02:19:03.918
Colonel Saito has kindly
permitted me to stay behind...

02:19:04.128 --> 02:19:06.462
with Major Clipton
and the sick men...

02:19:06.714 --> 02:19:10.216
and we'll rejoin you
in a few days' time.

02:19:12.261 --> 02:19:15.430
Now that your work here
is finished...

02:19:15.638 --> 02:19:19.683
I suppose many of you
feel somewhat let down.

02:19:20.477 --> 02:19:22.477
That's quite understandable.

02:19:22.771 --> 02:19:25.397
It's a very natural reaction.

02:19:27.776 --> 02:19:31.029
But one day, in a week,
a month, a year...

02:19:31.237 --> 02:19:35.116
on that day when, God willing,
we all return to our homes again...

02:19:35.784 --> 02:19:40.996
you're going to feel very proud
of what you have achieved here...

02:19:41.165 --> 02:19:43.958
in the face of great adversity.

02:19:45.169 --> 02:19:47.295
What you have done should be...

02:19:48.172 --> 02:19:50.006
and I think will be...

02:19:50.382 --> 02:19:55.011
an example to all our countrymen,
soldier and civilian alike.

02:19:56.221 --> 02:19:58.765
You have survived with honour.

02:19:59.683 --> 02:20:01.476
That, and more.

02:20:03.145 --> 02:20:05.229
Here in the wilderness...

02:20:05.522 --> 02:20:08.983
you have turned defeat
into victory.

02:20:11.737 --> 02:20:13.780
I congratulate you.

02:20:14.323 --> 02:20:15.364
Well done.

02:20:20.746 --> 02:20:22.038
To the king.

02:23:04.409 --> 02:23:05.868
And you're in business.

02:23:06.078 --> 02:23:09.914
Now, you got everything? Sten,
ammunition, pack, canteen, knife.

02:23:10.082 --> 02:23:11.582
Yes.

02:23:11.875 --> 02:23:14.168
I'll be directly across the river.

02:23:15.629 --> 02:23:18.547
The professor says there's
always one more thing to do.

02:23:19.258 --> 02:23:21.467
I can't think of what it could be.

02:23:22.886 --> 02:23:25.429
Except to wish you
a long and happy life.

02:23:25.847 --> 02:23:27.390
Thank you.

02:25:42.651 --> 02:25:44.110
What's happened?

02:25:49.282 --> 02:25:51.033
The river's gone down.

02:26:13.265 --> 02:26:15.182
You can see the wire.

02:26:16.017 --> 02:26:17.309
The charges!

02:28:25.647 --> 02:28:28.023
Don't wait for the train.

02:28:28.316 --> 02:28:29.400
Do it now!

02:28:56.970 --> 02:29:00.806
If Saito is correct, the train
should be along in five or 10 minutes.

02:29:01.057 --> 02:29:03.809
If you don't mind,
I'll watch from up on the hill.

02:29:03.977 --> 02:29:06.145
Why? You'll get a better view
from the bridge.

02:29:06.313 --> 02:29:09.732
It's hard to explain, sir.
I'd rather not be a part of it.

02:29:09.983 --> 02:29:14.403
As you please. Honestly, sometimes
I don't understand you at all.

02:29:14.571 --> 02:29:18.907
Well, as you once said, sir,
I've got a lot to learn about the army.

02:29:25.874 --> 02:29:27.249
Good morning.

02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:29.752
River's gone down in the night.

02:31:14.482 --> 02:31:15.649
What's he doing?

02:32:02.447 --> 02:32:05.574
Colonel, there's something
rather odd going on.

02:32:05.867 --> 02:32:09.495
I think we better have a look around
before that train comes across.

02:33:08.346 --> 02:33:09.763
He's gone mad.

02:33:09.973 --> 02:33:12.057
He's leading him right to it.

02:33:12.308 --> 02:33:13.725
Our own man!

02:33:57.979 --> 02:34:00.856
I was right.
There is something going on.

02:34:56.037 --> 02:34:59.331
You've got to do it, boy.
You've got to do it now.

02:35:02.168 --> 02:35:06.171
Colonel, have you a knife? I've just
realised the bridge has been mined.

02:35:06.339 --> 02:35:07.798
Mined?

02:35:14.681 --> 02:35:15.764
Good boy!

02:35:20.728 --> 02:35:23.647
Officer, sir. British officer.
Here to blow up the bridge.

02:35:23.815 --> 02:35:27.859
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir. British commando orders.

02:35:28.069 --> 02:35:30.779
- Blow up the bridge?
- Yes, sir. There's no time!

02:35:30.947 --> 02:35:33.407
No, no! Help!

02:35:38.079 --> 02:35:39.955
Help!

02:35:40.665 --> 02:35:42.958
Kill him! Kill him!

02:35:43.334 --> 02:35:45.794
Let me go, sir!
You don't understand, sir!

02:35:46.838 --> 02:35:49.715
Kill him! Kill him!

02:35:54.637 --> 02:35:56.388
Help!

02:36:00.018 --> 02:36:02.144
Kill him, Joyce! Kill him!

02:36:55.281 --> 02:36:58.992
You!

02:37:12.882 --> 02:37:14.674
What have I done?

02:38:23.327 --> 02:38:24.870
Madness.

02:38:37.425 --> 02:38:39.259
I had to do it.

02:38:40.178 --> 02:38:43.430
I had to do it.
They might have been captured alive.

02:38:43.931 --> 02:38:45.932
It was the only thing to do!

02:39:22.220 --> 02:39:27.682
Madness.
