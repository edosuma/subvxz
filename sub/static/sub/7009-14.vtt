11:09.168 --> 11:14.339
AND YOUR MOM...
PROBABLY ONE CELL OVER.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.049
SO THAT JUST
LEAVES ME.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.843
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S
REALLY IN TROUBLE HERE.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.096
LOOK, FORMAN, I'LL BE IN AS
MUCH TROUBLE AS YOU ARE

11:21.263 --> 11:25.850
AS SOON AS EDNA
SOBERS UP.

11:26.018 --> 11:31.856
I WILL BE DEPORTED.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.567
THEY'RE GONNA SEND ME
BACK TO MY HOMELAND,

11:34.735 --> 11:36.986
THE BEAUTIFUL ISLAND OF...

11:37.697 --> 11:39.906
OKAY, WHO'S
THE RINGLEADER HERE?

11:40.074 --> 11:42.409
[ALL]
HE IS.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.119
YOU GET ONE PHONE CALL.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.453
TO ANYWHERE?

11:45.621 --> 11:49.124
ONE LOCAL PHONE CALL.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.127
SO, WHO SHOULD
WE CALL?

11:52.294 --> 11:55.296
I'D CALL RED, BUT I
FEEL SAFER IN JAIL.

11:56.841 --> 12:01.428
I, UH, DON'T KNOW
MY PHONE NUMBER.

12:01.595 --> 12:04.180
I CAN'T CALL EDNA, MAN.
IT'S POKER NIGHT.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.598
NO OFFENSE, BUT
ISN'T EVERY NIGHT

12:05.766 --> 12:09.269
"POKE 'ER NIGHT"
FOR EDNA?

12:14.442 --> 12:15.608
NO, NO, NO.
I GOT IT.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.236
I'LL CALL JACKIE.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.157
HER DAD'S A LAWYER,

12:22.324 --> 12:26.953
AND SHE'S GOT
A CHECKBOOK.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.288
HELLO?

12:28.456 --> 12:31.583
JACKIE?
OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE HOME.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.042
I WAS DRIVING
A STOLEN CAR,

12:33.210 --> 12:34.961
AND I GOT ARRESTED.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.046
OH, MICHAEL, THIS IS
JUST LIKE THE BOOK

12:37.214 --> 12:39.132
"PRISONER OF LOVE"
WHERE CLIFF,

12:39.300 --> 12:41.468
THE RUGGED YET SWEET
MOTORCYCLE MECHANIC,

12:41.635 --> 12:43.845
WAS THROWN INTO JAIL,

12:44.013 --> 12:45.889
AND THEN HIS TRUE LOVE
TASHA WAS FORCED

12:46.056 --> 12:48.767
TO BE A SLAVE FOR THIS
REALLY RICH MEAN GUY.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.143
JACKIE, I'M NOT
KIDDING AROUND.

12:50.311 --> 12:53.730
I'M REALLY IN JAIL.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.274
OH MY GOD.
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:56.442 --> 12:58.026
YEAH, I GUESS,

12:58.194 --> 13:00.278
BUT I'M A LITTLE COLD.

13:00.446 --> 13:03.948
IT'S LONELY
IN THE JOINT, JACKIE.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.950
OH MY GOD.
YOU'RE REALLY IN JAIL.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.077
WHAT IF YOU
NEVER GET OUT?

13:08.245 --> 13:11.289
THAT WOULD REALLY...
SUCK?

13:11.457 --> 13:13.291
YES, IT WOULD, MICHAEL,
AND I PROMISE,

13:13.459 --> 13:14.709
THE MINUTE YOU GET
OUT OF PRISON,

13:14.877 --> 13:17.045
I'M GONNA PROVE
MY LOVE TO YOU.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.840
COOL.
THANKS.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.175
MICHAEL, DO YOU
EVEN KNOW

13:22.343 --> 13:23.593
WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU?

13:23.761 --> 13:26.221
YEAH.

13:26.388 --> 13:29.098
NO.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.976
WE'RE GONNA MAKE LOVE,
YOU IDIOT.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.771
ALL RIGHT!

13:45.199 --> 13:46.908
YOU TWO HAVE A NICE
LITTLE TALK?

13:47.076 --> 13:49.035
OH YEAH!

13:51.539 --> 13:52.747
YOU KNOW
WHAT'S FUNNY?

13:52.915 --> 13:54.082
WHAT?

13:54.250 --> 13:55.458
NOTHING!

13:55.626 --> 13:59.295
BECAUSE YOU FORGOT TO ASK
HER FOR HELP, YOU MORON!

14:00.464 --> 14:03.216
OH MY GOD.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.635
GIVE ME
ANOTHER DIME.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.263
WE ONLY HAD
ONE DIME.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.516
WE ONLY GOT
ONE PHONE CALL.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.143
OH MY GOD.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.478
SOMEBODY GIVE ME
A SPOON.

14:15.646 --> 14:19.023
I'M GONNA DIG MY WAY
OUTTA HERE.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.197
LOOK AT THIS.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.574
HERE WE ARE
SITTING DOWN TO DINNER,

14:27.741 --> 14:29.367
ERIC'S NOT EVEN
HOME YET.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.494
WELL, HONEY, YOU
TOOK AWAY HIS CAR.

14:31.662 --> 14:35.164
HE HAS TO WALK
EVERYWHERE.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.834
WALKING'S GOOD FOR HIM.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.879
RED, WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO BE SO HARD ON HIM?

14:41.046 --> 14:43.715
SAME REASON MY OLD MAN
WAS HARD ON ME...

14:43.883 --> 14:46.634
TO PREPARE ME
FOR THE WORLD.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.262
YOU KNOW, KITTY,
WHEN I WAS HIS AGE,

14:49.430 --> 14:52.307
I COULD HAVE PARACHUTED
ONTO A DESERTED ISLAND

14:52.474 --> 14:54.851
WITH NOTHING BUT
A SWISS ARMY KNIFE,

14:55.019 --> 14:57.854
AND I'D HAVE SURVIVED.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.355
WELL, OKAY, THEN, WE'VE
LEARNED SOMETHING...

14:59.523 --> 15:02.942
NO SKYDIVING FOR ERIC.

15:03.110 --> 15:06.070
I TELL YOU, KITTY, THE WORLD
IS A TOUGH PLACE.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.698
YOU DROP YOUR GUARD
FOR ONE SECOND,

15:08.866 --> 15:12.994
AND IT'LL KICK YOU
RIGHT IN THE ASS.

15:13.162 --> 15:17.749
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT, RED,
THE WORLD IS HARD.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.919
SO WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF
ERIC CAME HOME TO A PLACE

15:21.086 --> 15:24.255
THAT WASN'T?

15:24.423 --> 15:25.840
ALL RIGHT, KITTY,

15:26.008 --> 15:27.717
WHEN YOU WIN
THE LOTTERY,

15:27.885 --> 15:31.054
YOU CAN BUY HIM
DISNEYLAND.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.267
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE WENT TO THAT CLASS.

15:36.435 --> 15:40.939
MARRIED WOMEN DO NOT
ABANDON THEIR FAMILIES.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.942
SURE THEY DO, DAD.
IT'S THE SEVENTIES.

15:44.735 --> 15:45.944
I KNOW WHAT DECADE IT IS.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.612
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
I'M EATING A SANDWICH

15:47.780 --> 15:50.114
INSTEAD OF A HOT MEAL.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.409
WELL, WANT ME TO MICROWAVE
IT FOR YOU?

15:54.453 --> 15:56.996
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY SHE NEEDS THIS.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.706
I'VE GIVEN HER
A GREAT LIFE.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.292
DAD, THAT'S NOT
THE ISSUE.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.961
THE WHOLE POINT
OF THE EQUAL RIGHTS

16:03.128 --> 16:04.462
AMENDMENT IS SO THAT
WOMEN DON'T HAVE

16:04.630 --> 16:07.006
TO DEFINE THEMSELVES
BY A MAN.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.341
DONNA, IS THIS
ABOUT CLOTHES?

16:08.509 --> 16:10.468
'CAUSE I COULD
BUY YOU CLOTHES.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.223
THIS IS POINTLESS.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.557
HEY, WHILE YOU'RE UP,

16:16.725 --> 16:19.644
YOU WANNA
GET DADDY A BEER?

16:19.812 --> 16:22.105
HONEY?

16:23.941 --> 16:26.317
ERIC, YOU GOTTA
DO SOMETHING, MAN.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.652
ME?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.196
HEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU,
KELSO, OR HYDE?

16:30.364 --> 16:35.159
I CAN'T TALK TO COPS, MAN.
I GO INSANE WITH RAGE.

16:35.327 --> 16:38.037
OH, AND...
ME TOO.

16:38.205 --> 16:41.082
NUTS.
WHOO!

16:41.250 --> 16:43.459
ERIC, YOU GOTTA
HELP US.

16:43.627 --> 16:48.840
SO NOW I'M BACK IN CHARGE?
THIS IS SO TYPICAL.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.010
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
FINE.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.512
ONCE AGAIN, I'LL SUCK IT UP,
BE THE MAN,

16:54.680 --> 16:57.473
AND SAVE ALL
OF YOUR SORRY ASSES.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.480
OFFICER, I NEED TO TALK

17:08.861 --> 17:11.154
YOU GOTTA LET ME GO!

17:11.321 --> 17:12.488
PLEASE, GOD!

17:12.656 --> 17:14.657
MY DAD'S GONNA
KILL ME.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.284
YOU STOLE A CAR, KID.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.412
WHAT KINDA COP WOULD I BE
IF I JUST LET YOU GO?

17:19.580 --> 17:23.124
MY BEST FRIEND THE COP?

17:23.292 --> 17:24.625
LOOK, IT REALLY
WASN'T MY FAULT.

17:24.793 --> 17:26.461
WE BORROWED IT
FROM A FRIEND.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.087
YEAH, I HAVEN'T HEARD
THAT ONE BEFORE.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.547
HEY, GUESS WHAT?

17:29.715 --> 17:31.049
THEY DIDN'T REALLY
STEAL THE CAR.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.633
THEY BORROWED IT
FROM A FRIEND.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.343
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THEY DID.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.137
TURNS OUT THIS GUY
SULLY BORROWED IT

17:36.305 --> 17:37.930
FROM HIS GRANDMOTHER,
AND SHE FORGOT

17:38.098 --> 17:39.891
AND CALLED IT IN STOLEN.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.852
NICE OLD LADY, THOUGH.
SHE PLAYS BINGO.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.313
OH MY GOD.
THIS IS GREAT.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.647
SO WE'RE FREE TO GO?

17:46.815 --> 17:47.982
YEAH.
WHICH ONE ARE YOU?

17:48.150 --> 17:49.567
ERIC FORMAN.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.194
FORMAN?

17:51.361 --> 17:54.197
IS YOUR DAD RED FORMAN?

18:50.921 --> 18:53.673
MIDGE, I, UH...

18:55.384 --> 18:57.969
THEN I GUESS
I'M HAPPY.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.638
