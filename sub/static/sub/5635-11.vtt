00:19.805 --> 00:22.017
Rudy's birthday
party, here we come.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.674
Yeah, we're coming for Rudy,

00:23.675 --> 00:25.092
but we're staying
for the bounce house.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.811
If I die from fun today,

00:26.812 --> 00:28.429
scatter my ashes
in the bounce house,

00:28.430 --> 00:29.564
and tell them to keep bouncing.

00:29.565 --> 00:31.515
There's Rudy's party.

00:31.516 --> 00:33.684
Hey, they started bouncing
without us. ‭Let's go!

00:33.685 --> 00:35.903
Should we drop Rudy's present
on the present pile, first?

00:35.904 --> 00:38.189
Let's start a new present
pile right, uh, here.

00:38.190 --> 00:39.350
Just get your damn shoes off!

00:39.358 --> 00:41.191
Excuse me, who are you?

00:41.276 --> 00:43.526
Um, we're friends
with the birthday boy.

00:43.579 --> 00:47.083
Oh, 'cause last time I checked,
this was my party,

00:47.165 --> 00:48.866
but let me check again.

00:48.867 --> 00:51.201
Okay, the cake says,
"Happy Birthday, Dahlia."

00:51.253 --> 00:52.881
The banner says, "Dahlia."

00:52.921 --> 00:54.372
That checks out.

00:54.373 --> 00:55.756
Okay, yeah, still my party.

00:55.757 --> 00:57.290
What is you point, woman?!

00:57.376 --> 00:59.927
You kids have to leave,
like, now.

00:59.928 --> 01:02.212
There's Rudy's party.

01:02.297 --> 01:03.513
That's weird.
‭Sasha?

01:03.548 --> 01:05.382
Tina Belcher, haven't seen you

01:05.384 --> 01:07.550
since you cost me
the King's Head Grand Prix.

01:07.636 --> 01:09.520
We saw each other
at the mall last month.

01:09.521 --> 01:11.054
Yeah, I don't do malls;
that wasn't me.

01:11.106 --> 01:12.556
Oh, that explains
why he kept saying,

01:12.557 --> 01:14.392
"I don't know you.
I'm not Sasha."

01:14.393 --> 01:15.726
What are you doing here?

01:15.727 --> 01:17.561
Is this some kind
of rich kid thing,

01:17.562 --> 01:19.479
where you come to the park
and throw money at the ducks?

01:19.564 --> 01:22.533
Ugh, it's my super-annoying
cousin Dahlia's birthday party,

01:22.534 --> 01:24.567
and my mom made me come
help my aunt chaperone.

01:24.620 --> 01:26.039
You have an Aunt Chaperone?

01:26.071 --> 01:27.655
Between you, me and the trees,

01:27.656 --> 01:28.955
Dahlia is history's
greatest monster.

01:29.041 --> 01:31.158
Sasha, nobody's even
touching the crudité.

01:31.159 --> 01:34.078
Go tell them it's rad,
or whatever kids say.

01:34.079 --> 01:35.579
Okay, Aunt Caitlin.

01:35.580 --> 01:37.214
See you later, Belchers.

01:37.215 --> 01:39.166
Sasha, don't call
these children that.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.384
It's our last name.

01:40.385 --> 01:41.919
Well, he still shouldn't say it.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.721
Hey, guys, thanks for coming.

01:43.722 --> 01:47.724
I'm turning nine,
and I'm feeling fine.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.510
Yeah, happy birthday.
Here's your gift.

01:49.511 --> 01:51.095
It's a holster for your inhaler.

01:51.096 --> 01:52.563
It's supposed to be
for pepper spray,

01:52.564 --> 01:55.015
but we realized it could be
used for any spray.

01:55.100 --> 01:57.068
Oh, wow, that's so nice.

01:57.069 --> 01:58.903
My birthday's
the same day as Ollie's.

01:58.904 --> 02:00.738
My birthday's
the same day as Andy's.

02:00.739 --> 02:02.490
Just saying,
we like holsters, too.

02:02.491 --> 02:04.107
Hint, hint.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.327
So, uh, I hate to be
the guy that's like,

02:06.328 --> 02:08.245
"Where's your friggin'
bounce house?"

02:08.246 --> 02:10.914
but where's
your friggin' bounce house, Rudy?

02:10.916 --> 02:12.867
There was a mix-up
with the rental company.

02:12.868 --> 02:14.785
They thought it was
a duplicate order

02:14.786 --> 02:17.254
and only dropped off one
for that party over there.

02:17.255 --> 02:18.955
What?! ‭What?!
‭Can't they just bring another one?

02:19.041 --> 02:20.791
No, they rented them all out.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.293
My dad's on the phone really
giving it to them right now.

02:23.378 --> 02:25.463
Mm-hmm. N-No, I-I understand.

02:25.464 --> 02:26.763
T-Totally.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.349
This can't be happening!

02:28.350 --> 02:30.600
Happy birthday, Rudy!
Where's the bounce house?

02:30.635 --> 02:32.853
There is no bounce
house, Harley.

02:32.854 --> 02:34.554
No!

02:34.639 --> 02:37.024
Oh, it's okay.
I don't need a bounce house.

02:37.025 --> 02:39.143
I got my buds, I got cake,

02:39.144 --> 02:41.811
and later we'll be making spoon
puppets and putting on a show.

02:41.897 --> 02:43.447
Spoon puppets? Ugh.

02:43.448 --> 02:44.982
Let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

02:44.983 --> 02:46.784
Well, they really
screwed us here, kids,

02:46.785 --> 02:49.453
and, uh, they suggest
we go ask that party

02:49.454 --> 02:51.622
to "share"
the bounce house with us.

02:51.623 --> 02:54.241
They said that's the fun
part about bounce houses,

02:54.242 --> 02:55.993
there's always enough
bounces to go around.

02:55.994 --> 02:57.411
Oh, God, this is a disaster.

02:57.412 --> 02:58.829
Hey, it's okay, Dad.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.247
We've got juice and sunshine.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.549
We don't have any juice.

03:01.550 --> 03:03.250
Oh. Well, we've got water.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.919
No, we're out of water.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.754
Come on, I'm sure
we can talk that girl

03:06.755 --> 03:08.806
into letting us share;
she seemed nice.

03:08.807 --> 03:11.141
No. ‭Oh, good.
Oh, you said, "No."

03:11.176 --> 03:13.227
Yeah, I'm not gonna
share my bounce house

03:13.228 --> 03:14.894
with some rando kids.

03:14.980 --> 03:16.263
Uh, thanks for considering.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.692
Hey, same birthday club.

03:17.733 --> 03:18.733
Uh-uh.

03:18.734 --> 03:20.434
Yeah, so we good?

03:22.020 --> 03:24.321
Uh, can I buy
some juice off of you?

03:24.322 --> 03:26.357
No, we need it for
the after-party.

03:26.358 --> 03:28.192
Do you have any water?

03:28.193 --> 03:31.028
No.

03:31.029 --> 03:33.750
Okay, I guess we could
always drink from the pond.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.500
So, I have to ask.

03:36.501 --> 03:38.035
I've been here 20 minutes,
and I still can't tell.

03:38.036 --> 03:39.253
Is that a real pigeon?

03:39.254 --> 03:40.454
What? Pigeon? What pigeon?

03:40.455 --> 03:41.539
What are you talking about?

03:41.540 --> 03:42.923
Up there, on the TV.

03:42.924 --> 03:44.174
‭Oh, my God.

03:44.209 --> 03:45.459
Oh, wow.

03:45.460 --> 03:46.459
Oh, no, no.

03:46.545 --> 03:48.129
So I'm not seeing things.

03:48.130 --> 03:50.548
I got pretty drunk this morning
at brunch at the lodge.

03:50.549 --> 03:52.048
Did you know there's vodka
in a bloody Mary?

03:52.100 --> 03:53.551
Bob, what are you doing?

03:53.552 --> 03:55.219
Uh, I'm moving away
from the pigeon

03:55.220 --> 03:56.387
that's inside of the restaurant.

03:56.388 --> 03:58.022
How'd it get in here?

03:58.023 --> 03:59.056
Did it just walk
through the door?

03:59.057 --> 04:00.558
Can pigeons open doors?

04:00.559 --> 04:01.809
Do you mean metaphorically?

04:01.810 --> 04:03.144
In the right situation,
I suppose.

04:03.145 --> 04:04.979
‭

04:04.980 --> 04:07.480
God, Bob, I've never seen you
so afraid of something so tiny.

04:07.566 --> 04:09.733
It's not tiny.
It's like a small eagle.

04:09.734 --> 04:11.202
All right, well, calm down.

04:11.203 --> 04:12.570
I'll shoo it out.

04:12.571 --> 04:14.205
Teddy, open the door.
‭Got it.

04:14.206 --> 04:15.822
I guess, Bob,
you keep cowering. On it.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.491
Come on, Mr. Pigeon, come on.

04:17.492 --> 04:19.577
Mr. Pigeon, come on, out.

04:22.380 --> 04:23.881
Thanks for scaring him
toward my face!

04:23.882 --> 04:24.999
Bob, what are you doing?
You're freaking him out.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.583
I'm gonna go to the kitchen.

04:26.668 --> 04:29.386
Not 'cause I'm scared,
but because I'm the cook.

04:29.387 --> 04:30.638
Yeah, right,
you don't look scared at all.

04:30.639 --> 04:32.640
Is it still out there?

04:32.641 --> 04:35.593
Yes, it's still here, sitting
on one of the stools right now.

04:35.594 --> 04:36.677
It's a stool pigeon.

04:36.678 --> 04:38.429
Stool pigeon.

04:38.430 --> 04:40.930
Will you stop
having fun with this?

04:41.016 --> 04:44.517
Good thing we have these
spoon puppets to fall back on.

04:44.603 --> 04:47.321
Everybody, pull up a seat
and let's get spooning!

04:47.322 --> 04:48.533
This is unjust.

04:48.607 --> 04:50.523
Hey, look what I made, a robot.

04:50.609 --> 04:53.444
Ugh, Rudy,
you have been so wronged here,

04:53.445 --> 04:54.945
on your birthday.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.780
We can't allow this to happen.

04:56.781 --> 04:58.331
We're getting
in that bounce house.

04:58.416 --> 05:00.450
But Dahlia already said
we can't share it.

05:00.502 --> 05:02.286
But she didn't say
we can't steal it.

05:03.672 --> 05:04.872
But wasn't that kind of implied?

05:04.873 --> 05:06.635
Oh, my God,
a bounce house heist!

05:08.130 --> 05:10.306
We should be filling
that bounce house up with farts,

05:10.375 --> 05:11.675
not them.

05:11.676 --> 05:13.477
I bet they're not even farting.

05:13.478 --> 05:15.196
Don't worry, tell your butts
we'll be in there soon enough.

05:15.197 --> 05:16.730
Or, hey,

05:16.731 --> 05:19.567
maybe we don't steal
the bounce house, eh?

05:19.568 --> 05:22.953
Oh, Rudy, stealing is
the best part of any birthday.

05:22.954 --> 05:25.289
Is this the first bounce
house you've ever stolen?

05:25.290 --> 05:26.957
Sasha, have you been
spying on us,

05:26.958 --> 05:28.241
spying on your cousin?

05:28.326 --> 05:29.743
Don't flatter yourself.

05:29.744 --> 05:31.295
I was over here,
taking a Dahlia break,

05:31.296 --> 05:33.080
staring at the so-called water,

05:33.081 --> 05:34.998
when I happened to overhear
your so-called plan.

05:35.083 --> 05:36.584
Oh, snap.

05:36.585 --> 05:38.052
Okay, fine, I'll do it.
‭Do what?

05:38.053 --> 05:39.887
I'll help you steal
Dahlia's bounce house.

05:39.888 --> 05:41.138
Why would we need your help?

05:41.139 --> 05:42.755
Uh, first of all, ouch.

05:42.841 --> 05:44.475
Second of all,
you need a man on the inside.

05:44.476 --> 05:46.177
I am that man.

05:46.178 --> 05:49.062
Uh, Dahlia is your cousin;
we can't trust you.

05:49.147 --> 05:52.639
Oh, yeah, yeah, she's my cousin,
but I wish she was-n.

05:52.684 --> 05:53.683
Really?

05:55.937 --> 05:57.938
Um, are you trying
to look into my soul?

05:57.939 --> 05:59.690
Already there,
and it isn't pretty.

05:59.691 --> 06:00.858
But you're not lying.

06:00.859 --> 06:02.243
Not about this.

06:02.244 --> 06:03.577
Okay, we can trust him.

06:03.578 --> 06:04.995
So, listen, you can't just go

06:04.996 --> 06:06.697
drag this thing
back to your spot.

06:06.698 --> 06:09.033
It's staked down, it needs
a generator, it needs a fan,

06:09.034 --> 06:10.501
and, oh,
it's a 22-foot-tall castle.

06:10.502 --> 06:12.085
Here's what I'm thinking,

06:12.170 --> 06:14.338
You don't need the fan
or the genny if you find a way

06:14.339 --> 06:16.123
to seal the thing up,
duct tape or something.

06:16.124 --> 06:18.209
My wallet is made of duct tape;
is that helpful?

06:18.210 --> 06:19.126
No. Oh.

06:19.127 --> 06:20.845
We're also gonna need a place

06:20.846 --> 06:23.046
to put the bounce house
where Dahlia can't get to it.

06:23.131 --> 06:25.181
There, the lake.
Hmm, interesting.

06:25.217 --> 06:27.017
She's not gonna want
to wade out there to get to you.

06:27.018 --> 06:28.469
Yeah, it's only three feet deep,

06:28.470 --> 06:30.553
but two of those feet
are duck poop, I heard.

06:30.605 --> 06:32.223
Yes, the lake, that's the spot.

06:32.224 --> 06:34.275
But we're gonna have to do
something about the adults.

06:34.276 --> 06:35.692
Your dad, divorced, right?

06:35.727 --> 06:36.726
Why do you say that?

06:36.778 --> 06:37.978
He's here by himself,

06:37.979 --> 06:40.314
he's wearing skinny jeans,
retro eyeglasses,

06:40.315 --> 06:41.732
and his teeth look
like they're on day five

06:41.733 --> 06:42.982
of a whitening strips program.

06:43.068 --> 06:44.034
You're good.

06:44.035 --> 06:45.619
I know. My aunt's divorced, too.

06:45.620 --> 06:47.404
I'll send her this way.

06:47.405 --> 06:48.989
Her New Year's resolution
was to be less picky.

06:48.990 --> 06:50.541
Let's put that to the test.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.209
Gene, Tina, go search
that ranger truck.

06:52.210 --> 06:54.495
It looks like the bumper
is held on with duct tape.

06:54.496 --> 06:55.879
Maybe there's a roll
in the back.

06:55.914 --> 06:57.298
More stealing?

06:57.299 --> 06:58.832
It's not stealing,
it's borrowing.

06:58.833 --> 07:00.501
Everything we're taking today
is going back

07:00.502 --> 07:02.253
to its rightful owners
when we're done with it.

07:02.254 --> 07:03.504
Plus, tape is everyone's.

07:03.505 --> 07:05.339
You can't own tape.

07:05.340 --> 07:07.892
Aw...
I think it's all tired out

07:07.893 --> 07:09.593
from smashing into the window.

07:09.594 --> 07:11.729
Don't know why the open door
isn't as inviting.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.014
Eh, I've walked into
that window a couple of times.

07:14.015 --> 07:15.432
Let's just corner it and grab it

07:15.433 --> 07:16.767
and take it outside, right?

07:16.768 --> 07:18.235
Okay, I'll do the grabbing.

07:18.236 --> 07:19.687
I haven't held a living
thing for a while.

07:19.688 --> 07:20.938
It'll be good for me.

07:22.357 --> 07:23.107
Ah!

07:23.108 --> 07:24.275
Whoo!

07:24.276 --> 07:25.826
He seems strangely okay
with this.

07:25.827 --> 07:26.944
What is this,
reverse psychology?

07:26.945 --> 07:28.829
Huh? What are you doing?

07:28.830 --> 07:30.748
Teddy, Teddy, wait, wait,
let me see him, let me see him.

07:30.749 --> 07:31.782
Huh?

07:31.783 --> 07:33.167
Aw, so docile.

07:33.168 --> 07:34.835
Maybe we should take it to Bob.

07:34.836 --> 07:36.537
We'll show him
how harmless it is.

07:36.538 --> 07:38.289
That sounds like a great idea!

07:38.290 --> 07:40.507
Yeah, he'll see how cute
it is and realize pigeons

07:40.508 --> 07:42.176
are nothing to be
afraid of, come on.

07:42.177 --> 07:43.877
Yeah, that's how
I got over my fear of babies.

07:43.878 --> 07:46.013
Hi, Bobby.
We're coming down.

07:46.014 --> 07:47.765
Bob? You decent?

07:47.766 --> 07:49.767
Yes, Teddy. Why
wouldn't I be decent?

07:49.768 --> 07:51.601
I-I don't know
how you run your business.

07:51.636 --> 07:53.137
Did you get the pigeon out?

07:53.138 --> 07:54.972
Maybe. Before we answer that,
come here.

07:54.973 --> 07:56.307
What?

07:56.308 --> 07:57.608
Hold out your...
close your eyes.

07:57.609 --> 07:59.108
No. What are you... what?

07:59.144 --> 08:01.729
Hold out your hands.
What are you doing, Lin?

08:01.730 --> 08:02.895
Hold them out. Get them...

08:02.981 --> 08:04.031
Okay, okay.

08:04.032 --> 08:05.149
Why are you holding it?!

08:05.150 --> 08:06.232
Why'd you bring it down here?!

08:06.318 --> 08:07.568
Because it's harmless, Bobby.

08:07.569 --> 08:08.985
Look, it's a baby.

08:09.037 --> 08:10.788
Pigeons aren't harmless, Lin.

08:10.789 --> 08:13.374
They steal French fries
and they poop on everything

08:13.375 --> 08:15.458
and they attack people's faces.

08:15.493 --> 08:17.161
Just pet it, Bobby, you'll see.

08:17.162 --> 08:18.579
Look, he likes it.

08:18.580 --> 08:19.963
He's so soft.
Get it away!

08:19.998 --> 08:21.215
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:22.667 --> 08:23.917
Great, now you got the pigeon

08:23.918 --> 08:25.586
stuck deeper into
the restaurant.

08:25.587 --> 08:27.671
Okay, okay, you just got
to let it exhaust itself.

08:27.672 --> 08:28.889
Like Gene at dinner.

08:28.890 --> 08:30.975
Oh, my God.

08:30.976 --> 08:32.592
Wee-yoo, wee-yoo.

08:32.594 --> 08:34.678
Single dad checking out
Aunt Caitlin alert.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.397
What? Where?

08:36.398 --> 08:38.065
The guy who wanted to
share the bounce house?

08:38.066 --> 08:39.683
Oh, I'm sure that was just

08:39.683 --> 08:41.150
his pathetic excuse
to come over here.

08:41.152 --> 08:42.318
Eh.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.654
Okay, you're out of his league,

08:43.655 --> 08:44.938
but you've been away
from the game.

08:44.939 --> 08:46.690
Take a few swings,
shag some ground balls.

08:46.691 --> 08:47.941
I don't know.

08:47.942 --> 08:50.027
Look, he may not be
a sugar daddy,

08:50.028 --> 08:51.528
but he's a daddy, sugar.

08:51.529 --> 08:52.863
Hmm. How do I look?

08:52.864 --> 08:54.081
Pretty divorced.

08:54.082 --> 08:55.281
Go get him.

08:55.367 --> 08:57.167
Hey, Rudy's dad.

08:57.168 --> 08:59.670
What do you, uh,
think of Dahlia's mom?

08:59.671 --> 09:01.789
Uh, I'd let that dump me.

09:01.790 --> 09:04.041
Sorry, you're kids;
but that is my answer.

09:04.042 --> 09:06.542
Well, she seems to
be coming over here,

09:06.628 --> 09:08.011
and she's looking at you.

09:08.046 --> 09:10.214
Really? H-How do I look?

09:10.215 --> 09:12.632
Like a man who's about to find
romance in a public park.

09:12.717 --> 09:13.884
Rudy, booger check?

09:13.885 --> 09:15.219
Clear, except for Ol' Faithful.

09:15.220 --> 09:16.686
He's never coming out.

09:16.721 --> 09:18.388
That's right, son.

09:18.473 --> 09:20.057
Great park, huh?
Really great park.

09:20.058 --> 09:21.692
I mean, if you like parks.

09:21.693 --> 09:23.694
Yeah. Hey, remember
when it was closed

09:23.695 --> 09:25.696
because that guy
kept flashing joggers?

09:25.697 --> 09:27.614
Yeah. Yes, I do remember that.

09:27.615 --> 09:28.815
Yeah, well, that wasn't me.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.284
I don't... Yeah.
‭Good.

09:30.285 --> 09:32.036
I mean, I don't know
why I brought that up.

09:32.037 --> 09:33.953
It's the only thing I can
think of when I'm near a park.

09:34.039 --> 09:35.539
We did it.
The ranger had duct tape

09:35.540 --> 09:36.790
in his truck,
just like you said.

09:36.791 --> 09:38.742
And two dead raccoons.

09:38.743 --> 09:41.879
Being a ranger might not be
the glamorous job we thought it was.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.831
All right, time to move on
to phase two of the plan.

09:43.832 --> 09:45.049
Show me your taping faces.

09:45.050 --> 09:47.084
‭Gene, too big.

09:47.085 --> 09:49.586
Tina, perfect.
‭Thanks.

09:49.587 --> 09:52.588
Time to bring out my lovely
assistant, Miss Direction.

09:52.674 --> 09:54.508
Okay, Dahlia's friends
and Dahlia,

09:54.509 --> 09:56.393
gather round, near me.

09:56.394 --> 09:57.928
Focus all your attention here.

09:57.929 --> 09:59.430
There's nothing else
worth looking at.

09:59.431 --> 10:00.813
Time to toast the birthday girl.

10:00.899 --> 10:02.733
Oh, we're doing toasts?

10:02.734 --> 10:04.100
Talk about the friendship
bracelet company I'm starting,

10:04.152 --> 10:05.602
Wristy Business.
Hey, hey,

10:05.603 --> 10:08.105
eyes up here, kids;
older boy talking.

10:08.106 --> 10:10.524
So, what is there
to say about Dahlia

10:10.525 --> 10:12.526
that she hasn't already said
about herself?

10:12.527 --> 10:15.027
She is without a doubt,
my cousin.

10:15.113 --> 10:16.529
Wait, we forgot the cake.

10:16.614 --> 10:18.197
I'm gonna tell a funny,

10:18.283 --> 10:19.583
loud story about Dahlia.

10:19.584 --> 10:21.200
This is what she sounded like

10:21.286 --> 10:22.368
when she started her
friendship bracelet company:

10:22.454 --> 10:24.120
"Look at me.

10:24.205 --> 10:26.090
"I'm starting
a friendship bracelet company.

10:26.091 --> 10:28.458
I'm however many years old
and I'm an en-entrepreneur."

10:28.543 --> 10:29.876
Hmm?

10:29.961 --> 10:31.095
"How impressive." ‭

10:31.096 --> 10:32.629
My bounce castle!

10:32.630 --> 10:34.347
What? Oh, no. What's
happening? Why you?

10:34.432 --> 10:35.299
Go, go, go, go!

10:35.300 --> 10:36.467
Push, Jeremy, damn it.

10:36.468 --> 10:37.550
I'm pushing.

10:38.887 --> 10:40.269
Everybody in!

10:43.475 --> 10:44.942
Yes, we did it!

10:44.943 --> 10:46.776
Wait, where's Gene?
There!

10:47.812 --> 10:50.019
For cake's sake, wait for me!

10:54.402 --> 10:57.321
This is Rudy's bounce house now,
Dahlia!

10:57.322 --> 11:00.573
You can have it back once we've
bounced all the fun out of it!

11:04.799 --> 11:07.177
I'm floati, I'm bouncing,
there's cake.

11:07.178 --> 11:09.463
This is probably what it's like
to be an astronaut!

11:09.464 --> 11:11.547
I'm tall, I'm small,
I'm tall, I'm small...

11:11.599 --> 11:13.684
Bouncing on land is for idiots.

11:13.685 --> 11:15.718
Ow. Ow. Ow.

11:15.770 --> 11:17.104
Mom, go get it!

11:17.105 --> 11:18.522
I'm not going in there.

11:18.523 --> 11:20.056
Make your new boyfriend get it.

11:20.108 --> 11:21.475
Eh, uh, boyfriend?

11:21.476 --> 11:22.893
Okay.

11:22.894 --> 11:24.895
Uh, Rudy, kids, gonna need you

11:24.896 --> 11:27.563
to turn the castle around
and come back to shore!

11:27.615 --> 11:29.115
We can't steer it!

11:29.200 --> 11:30.901
Well, I tried.
It's up to the tides now.

11:30.902 --> 11:32.069
Thanks.

11:32.070 --> 11:33.402
You're very welcome.

11:33.488 --> 11:34.988
So, uh, what do you think, Rudy?

11:34.989 --> 11:36.623
What other kid
has a bounce house

11:36.624 --> 11:38.125
on a lake for his birthday?

11:38.126 --> 11:39.743
It's nice, I guess,

11:39.744 --> 11:41.578
but it's cutting into
spoon puppet time,

11:41.579 --> 11:43.380
and there are all those
angry kids waiting for us.

11:43.381 --> 11:44.715
Rudy, come on.

11:44.716 --> 11:47.417
It's your birthday party, man.
Enjoy it.

11:47.418 --> 11:49.719
Here, jump on some cake;
you'll like it.

11:51.472 --> 11:52.889
Whoa, still going.

11:52.890 --> 11:54.341
That's one tough pigeon.

11:54.342 --> 11:56.727
I wish I had
gone to Rudy's birthday.

11:56.728 --> 11:58.428
Is it weird if I just show up?

11:58.429 --> 12:00.230
Bob, what is going on with you?

12:00.231 --> 12:01.765
I've never seen you like this.

12:01.766 --> 12:03.100
Well, we've never had
a pigeon trapped

12:03.101 --> 12:05.068
in the restaurant before, Lin.

12:05.069 --> 12:08.105
We've lived a blessed life,
and now that's over.

12:08.106 --> 12:09.439
What's the matter? Did
something happen to you?

12:09.440 --> 12:10.857
Did a pigeon wrong you?

12:10.858 --> 12:13.277
I don't think so.
I mean, maybe.

12:13.278 --> 12:15.612
But it would probably take years
of therapy to...

12:15.613 --> 12:17.447
Oh, my God, I remember!

12:17.448 --> 12:19.866
What? What?
What happened? What?

12:19.867 --> 12:22.169
I just remembered
being in this house.

12:22.170 --> 12:23.587
It was dark inside.

12:23.588 --> 12:24.921
And for some reason...
I don't know why...

12:24.922 --> 12:26.840
I-I went upstairs.
Then I heard this

12:26.841 --> 12:28.675
strange fluttering
behind a door,

12:28.676 --> 12:30.127
and I stared at the doorknob

12:30.128 --> 12:32.012
for what felt like
three minutes.

12:32.013 --> 12:34.180
But then I went in,
and there was this big hole

12:34.265 --> 12:35.599
in the ceiling.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.467
You could see
the sky through it.

12:37.468 --> 12:39.686
And then I heard,
I-I heard this terrible cooing.

12:39.687 --> 12:41.271
I guess a bunch of pigeons

12:41.272 --> 12:42.889
had flown in there,
like, dozens.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.607
And then...
and then they attacked me.

12:46.477 --> 12:48.612
Oh, God!

12:48.613 --> 12:51.064
That didn't happen to you.
Yes, it did.

12:51.065 --> 12:53.984
No, it happened to Tippi
Hedren in The Birds. What?

12:53.985 --> 12:55.569
Bob, you're describing
an exact scene

12:55.570 --> 12:56.953
in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.

12:56.954 --> 12:58.538
They call it "shot for shot."

12:58.539 --> 13:00.707
Bob, you think
you're Tippi Hedren, honey.

13:00.708 --> 13:02.075
I don't think I'm Tippi Hedren.

13:02.076 --> 13:04.028
I'm describing
an event from my life.

13:04.045 --> 13:05.545
Oh, my God, I'm Tippi Hedren.

13:05.546 --> 13:07.297
Yeah, you wish.

13:07.298 --> 13:09.549
I guess I must have seen
that movie when I was young.

13:09.550 --> 13:11.668
Oh, you poor thing.
You poor dumb thing.

13:11.669 --> 13:13.136
So, I guess, technically,

13:13.137 --> 13:14.805
I shouldn't be afraid
of pigeons.

13:14.806 --> 13:16.673
There's so much other
stuff to be afraid of.

13:16.674 --> 13:18.258
Like getting stuck
in one of those beds

13:18.259 --> 13:19.509
that flips into the wall

13:19.510 --> 13:20.844
or falling down
the shower drain.

13:20.845 --> 13:22.095
Getting choked by a guy.

13:22.096 --> 13:23.563
What?
‭Nothing.

13:23.564 --> 13:24.930
Do you know what,
I'm gonna go downstairs

13:25.016 --> 13:26.016
and I'm gonna
get that bird myself.

13:26.017 --> 13:27.601
Really?

13:27.602 --> 13:29.353
Yeah. I'm not afraid
of pigeons anymore.

13:29.354 --> 13:30.354
Yay! Go, Bobby!

13:30.355 --> 13:32.071
Attaboy, Bob.

13:32.156 --> 13:34.191
You're not afraid of a pigeon.

13:34.192 --> 13:35.859
You're not afraid
of a pigeon, Bob.

13:35.860 --> 13:37.576
All right, here goes.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.616
Are you, uh...
are you still down here?

13:44.952 --> 13:49.289
Oh, that was a really
expensive bottle of olive oil.

13:49.290 --> 13:51.425
Did you do that? Probably.

13:51.426 --> 13:52.785
That was mean of you.

13:58.766 --> 14:00.049
Don't hurt me!

14:02.053 --> 14:04.380
Oh, what happened?
You-you don't look so good.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.807
Oh, you got him.

14:06.808 --> 14:08.558
Ew, wait.
What's all over it?

14:08.559 --> 14:10.060
It's covered in olive oil.

14:10.061 --> 14:11.611
Don't do it, Bob, don't do it!

14:11.612 --> 14:12.729
You can't eat your fears!

14:12.730 --> 14:14.197
I'm not gonna eat it, Teddy.

14:14.198 --> 14:15.816
Then why'd you put
olive oil on it?

14:15.817 --> 14:17.401
I Di... I didn't.

14:17.402 --> 14:18.902
It did it to itself.

14:18.903 --> 14:21.405
So, I guess,
let's put it outside?

14:21.406 --> 14:23.623
Okay, fly away. Go on.

14:23.624 --> 14:25.075
You're free.

14:25.076 --> 14:26.076
Go ahead, live your life.

14:26.077 --> 14:27.911
Don't look back.

14:27.912 --> 14:29.996
I don't think it can fly
with all that oil on it.

14:29.997 --> 14:31.498
Maybe it can just
walk home, right?

14:31.499 --> 14:33.383
It probably lives nearby.

14:33.384 --> 14:35.419
We can't just leave a bird
on the ground covered in oil.

14:35.420 --> 14:37.220
When did we make that rule?

14:37.221 --> 14:39.389
Why don't we just put some
bread crumbs on him, huh?

14:39.390 --> 14:41.925
Some cat's gonna come along
and have a pigeon Parmesan.

14:41.926 --> 14:44.094
Fine, we'll call a shelter,

14:44.095 --> 14:46.563
or whatever you do
for oily pigeons.

14:46.564 --> 14:49.266
Aw, we got a little
pigeon patient.

14:49.267 --> 14:50.567
Jump, jump, jump, jump,

14:50.568 --> 14:53.570
jump, jump, jump, jump, jump...

14:53.571 --> 14:54.938
Ramming speed!

14:54.939 --> 14:56.188
What was that?

14:56.274 --> 14:58.726
Row, row, row your boats!

15:00.194 --> 15:02.245
We're under attack!
It's a siege!

15:02.246 --> 15:03.947
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

15:03.948 --> 15:05.115
What are we gonna do?!

15:05.116 --> 15:06.533
Jeremy, seal the gates.

15:06.534 --> 15:08.618
Everyone else,
bounce on this side.

15:08.619 --> 15:11.621
We'll move this sucker
with bounce power.

15:13.124 --> 15:14.123
It's working.

15:16.093 --> 15:17.511
I found the weak spot!

15:17.512 --> 15:18.511
Rip it off.

15:18.596 --> 15:19.595
No, no, no, no!

15:20.507 --> 15:22.082
- No!
- Stop!

15:22.934 --> 15:24.851
Oh, no!

15:24.852 --> 15:26.670
Maybe it'll be fine
without air in it.

15:28.272 --> 15:29.271
Mm, yeah, maybe not.

15:29.273 --> 15:30.273
We're sinking!

15:30.274 --> 15:31.725
Everyone abandon ship!

15:31.726 --> 15:33.310
But I'm with my dad
this weekend,

15:33.311 --> 15:34.894
and he doesn't have a dryer.

15:34.979 --> 15:36.278
We don't have a choice!

15:39.617 --> 15:41.485
Yes! You lose.

15:41.486 --> 15:43.953
Yeah, you're right.
She's all yours.

15:43.988 --> 15:44.654
Oh.

15:44.655 --> 15:45.789
Sasha?

15:45.790 --> 15:47.073
I thought you were on our side.

15:47.074 --> 15:48.742
Gene, shush.
He's a double agent.

15:48.743 --> 15:50.494
He has to pretend to help them.

15:50.495 --> 15:52.295
Oh. Sorry, Sasha.

15:52.296 --> 15:53.663
I forgot you were
a double agent.

15:53.664 --> 15:54.998
Oh!

15:54.999 --> 15:55.998
Oh, man.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.001
Sasha? You bastard!

15:58.002 --> 15:59.753
Okay, fine, yes, I helped them,

15:59.754 --> 16:01.338
and I have zero regrets.

16:01.339 --> 16:03.924
This is Ranger Matthew Dainko.

16:03.925 --> 16:06.176
Come to shore immediately.

16:06.177 --> 16:07.894
You're in big trouble!

16:07.895 --> 16:10.283
- Well, now I have one regret.
- Aw, crap.

16:11.225 --> 16:13.714
So you took
this party's bouncy house,

16:13.715 --> 16:15.099
pushed it into the lake,

16:15.100 --> 16:17.384
sank it, and stole my duct tape.

16:17.385 --> 16:18.722
Who steals duct tape?!

16:18.803 --> 16:20.187
Kids will be kids, right?

16:20.188 --> 16:21.305
We're a bunch
of little stinkers.

16:21.306 --> 16:22.305
Yeah.

16:22.307 --> 16:24.524
These are serious charges.

16:24.559 --> 16:26.143
Oh, okay.
So what happens now?

16:26.144 --> 16:28.062
Shall we all exchange
information, Caitlin?

16:28.063 --> 16:29.613
No, no, thank you.

16:29.614 --> 16:30.614
But, just...
to cover all... ‭Nope, nope.

16:30.615 --> 16:31.698
Yeah, no, I'm good.

16:31.733 --> 16:33.232
These kids are going to jail.

16:33.318 --> 16:34.650
Jail?

16:34.736 --> 16:36.282
Well, ranger jail.

16:37.739 --> 16:39.907
These cones are like bars, okay?

16:39.908 --> 16:41.457
Don't cross them.

16:41.543 --> 16:42.959
They're not like bars.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.129
But we get your point.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.580
Can we crack a window?

16:46.581 --> 16:48.748
It's smelling
awfully rangery in here.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.085
No! Now, you,
it's paperwork time.

16:51.086 --> 16:53.553
Oh, you are very intense.

16:53.588 --> 16:55.889
Whew. I mean, little setback...

16:55.890 --> 16:57.891
got incarcerated...
but all in all,

16:57.892 --> 16:59.843
pretty great birthday party,
huh, Rudy-Rudes?

16:59.844 --> 17:03.146
Huh, your face is looking
a little red there, pal.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.932
Squishing
your fists pretty tight.

17:04.933 --> 17:06.936
Does that mean you're happy?

17:07.018 --> 17:09.737
"Great birthday party"?!

17:09.738 --> 17:11.989
Great?! This is the worst!

17:11.990 --> 17:13.607
I didn't want to steal
that bounce house,

17:13.608 --> 17:15.108
but none of you would listen.

17:15.109 --> 17:17.611
All I wanted
was a spoon puppet show.

17:17.612 --> 17:19.246
I wrote a script and everything!

17:19.247 --> 17:20.696
It's a comedy-drama

17:20.698 --> 17:23.000
with two strong female leads.

17:23.001 --> 17:26.035
I was proud of it.

17:26.121 --> 17:28.288
So...

17:28.289 --> 17:30.958
you didn't like your party.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.844
Right, uh-huh.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.430
Oh, okay. ‭What are...
what are they saying?

17:36.431 --> 17:37.548
They have a pigeon lady.

17:37.549 --> 17:39.133
She gives baths
to dirty pigeons.

17:39.134 --> 17:40.384
Aw.

17:40.385 --> 17:41.935
Dirty pigeon lady.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.604
So, does someone
come here and get it?

17:43.605 --> 17:45.472
Oh, we drive it to you.

17:45.473 --> 17:47.441
But you're, like, 50 miles away.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.309
It's just, I carried
the pigeon outside,

17:49.310 --> 17:51.278
and I-I took kind of
a big step today,

17:51.279 --> 17:53.647
so maybe you guys
should take it from here.

17:53.648 --> 17:55.399
Oh, okay, bye.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.817
What is it? What are we doing?

17:56.818 --> 17:57.868
What are we doing?

17:57.869 --> 17:59.987
Okay, Bob, it's ready!

17:59.988 --> 18:01.205
I'm in the bathroom, Lin!

18:01.206 --> 18:02.488
What?

18:02.574 --> 18:04.662
Why are you in the tub
with the pigeon?

18:04.742 --> 18:06.159
We were supposed
to give it a bath.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.994
Yeah, in the kitchen sink.

18:08.079 --> 18:09.439
I wouldn't fit
in the kitchen sink.

18:09.497 --> 18:11.080
Not you, just the pigeon.

18:11.166 --> 18:13.417
Oh, yeah.

18:13.418 --> 18:15.636
You're right.
I-I didn't think of that.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.838
That, uh, yeah, that would've
been the way to do it.

18:17.839 --> 18:18.839
Yes.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.090
But I did need a bath.

18:20.091 --> 18:21.558
I was touching a pigeon all day.

18:21.559 --> 18:22.810
Mm-hmm.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.845
Look, Lin, I put bubbles on him.

18:24.846 --> 18:27.146
He looks like
a British barrister.

18:27.182 --> 18:29.482
Hello. Guilty as charged.

18:29.517 --> 18:30.851
Well, I guess you're not
scared of pigeons anymore.

18:30.852 --> 18:32.269
I guess not.

18:32.270 --> 18:34.104
Hey, this is how The Birds
should have ended:

18:34.105 --> 18:36.527
Tippi Hedren taking a bath
with a bunch of birds.

18:38.026 --> 18:40.159
Hey, Rudy,
want to have a puppet show?

18:40.195 --> 18:41.862
No, it's too late.

18:41.863 --> 18:43.413
We don't have spoons,

18:43.414 --> 18:46.166
but we still have the makings
of a great cast here.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.533
Such as this up-and-comer.

18:47.619 --> 18:49.203
I'm Pam Flit.

18:49.204 --> 18:51.088
Get it? Pam Flit.

18:51.089 --> 18:55.208
I'm just dying to play a strong
female lead in a comedy-drama.

18:55.293 --> 18:57.211
I could watch that pamphlet
read the phone book.

18:57.212 --> 18:58.879
Tina, you're stamps.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.431
Stamps? I won't mail in
this performance.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.799
Gene, calculator.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.434
You can count on me.

19:04.435 --> 19:05.552
Type, type, type. "Boobs."

19:05.553 --> 19:07.187
Harley, stress ball.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.139
Oh, my God, I totally connect
with this character!

19:09.140 --> 19:12.142
Andy, Ollie, comb
and that other side of the comb.

19:12.143 --> 19:13.393
It's got perfect teeth.

19:13.394 --> 19:14.561
Like you, Ollie.

19:14.562 --> 19:15.312
Sasha, paper-clip.

19:15.313 --> 19:16.563
Thank you.

19:16.564 --> 19:17.898
Harley, I want the stress ball.

19:17.899 --> 19:19.066
Trade.
You're the paper-clip now.

19:19.067 --> 19:20.317
Ooh, I love the paper-clip!

19:20.318 --> 19:22.369
I am attached to this project.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.737
I want the paper-clip back.

19:23.738 --> 19:25.072
Just give me, give me it back.
‭No, no!

19:25.073 --> 19:26.907
Give me it back. Oh.
‭No, no!

19:26.908 --> 19:28.292
Hey, what about me?

19:28.293 --> 19:29.626
Uh, Jeremy, you're your belt.

19:29.627 --> 19:30.914
Oh, cool.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.329
Is this happening?

19:32.330 --> 19:33.747
Is this really happening?

19:33.748 --> 19:35.631
Yep. You got your script handy?

19:35.717 --> 19:38.422
Yeah. I mean, I was hoping
we could workshop it a little bit.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.003
Also, we should
probably tweak it,

19:40.004 --> 19:41.421
'cause it was
written for spoons.

19:41.422 --> 19:42.756
But you know what,
we'll find it.

19:42.757 --> 19:44.424
Let's just dive in.

19:44.425 --> 19:46.225
Hey, what are you kids
doing past the cones?

19:46.261 --> 19:47.844
You're touching all my stuff!

19:47.845 --> 19:49.729
All right, come on, kids.
We're free to leave.

19:49.764 --> 19:52.232
Oh, um, can we stay
a little longer?

19:52.233 --> 19:54.434
We're just about
to do my script.

19:54.435 --> 19:58.405
Yeah, my big monologue's
coming up, I assume.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.774
Oh, well, I, uh...
Okay, you can stay.

20:00.775 --> 20:02.442
What? I can't just let you kids

20:02.443 --> 20:04.027
stay in here
as long as you want.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.028
Then every kid would be
in here all the time.

20:06.114 --> 20:08.198
How about this?
We'll give you a part.

20:08.199 --> 20:11.418
Eh, I don't know.
What's the part?

20:11.419 --> 20:13.620
You can be, uh,
well, the stapler.

20:13.621 --> 20:15.122
The stapler?

20:15.123 --> 20:16.173
It's a pretty meaty part.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.590
All right, I'm in.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.960
Thanks, Louise.
This is the birthday I wanted.

20:19.961 --> 20:21.511
You're welcome, Rudy.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.680
All right, enough chitchat.
We got a show to do!

20:23.681 --> 20:25.515
Places, everyone.

20:25.516 --> 20:29.302
"We open on a tenement
in Baltimore in 1981."

20:29.387 --> 20:30.971
Last time I saw you,

20:30.972 --> 20:32.472
you were prom queen.

20:32.473 --> 20:34.857
Oh, yeah?
Well, now I'm a hooker.

20:34.943 --> 20:37.277
"She takes a long drag
off her cigarette,

20:37.278 --> 20:39.895
knowing it could be her last."

20:49.157 --> 20:51.491
Do the dirty pigeon,
do the dirty pigeon

20:51.492 --> 20:53.660
Do the dirty pigeon, do
the dirty pigeon

20:53.661 --> 20:56.079
Do the dirty pigeon,
do the dirty pigeon

20:56.080 --> 20:58.164
Do the dirty pigeon, do
the dirty pigeon

21:02.670 --> 21:05.004
Hello. Guilty as charged.

21:07.508 --> 21:10.177
Do the dirty pigeon,
do the dirty pigeon

21:10.178 --> 21:11.510
Do the dirty pigeon, do
the dirty pigeon

21:11.596 --> 21:13.049
Do the dirty pigeon...
