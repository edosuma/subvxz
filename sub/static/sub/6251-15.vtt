some gifts in here for us.

Yeah. All right
Let’s start bagging
some excrement

of maybe having
his sight returned,

from the subway just found out
he was cured of leukemia.

13:11.333 --> 13:14.496
- Yeah, it’s ironic.
- With all due respect
that’s not irony.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.373
People may think it’s irony,
but it’s really just a—

13:17.464 --> 13:19.580
unfortunate juxtaposition
of events.

13:19.675 --> 13:22.041
Well, guess they’re gonna need
a shorter word for that.

13:23.679 --> 13:25.544
Mm-hmm.

13:27.057 --> 13:31.426
Dr. Brennan, why doesn’t Agent Andy
wear a “Cocky” belt buckle?

13:31.520 --> 13:34.853
Because Andy isn’t Booth.
Wh-Why does everyone
think that?

13:34.940 --> 13:37.056
Agent Booth thinks he is.

13:37.192 --> 13:41.026
He says they are both
brave and attractive.
Well, he’s wrong.

13:41.113 --> 13:43.650
You do not think
he’s attractive?

13:43.740 --> 13:46.482
Uh, I think his symmetry
is pleasing, yes.

But, Ms. lwanaga,
the characters in my books...

13:49.705 --> 13:52.697

to further the forensics.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.002
Why does everyone think that?
lt-lt’s just sex.

13:59.131 --> 14:02.749
Imaginative sex.
Okay, I only
include that...

14:02.843 --> 14:05.084
and the personal interactions
to denote the passage of time.

I was there.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.953
You told Brennan
about that thing I do.

15:16.041 --> 15:20.284
- It’s a very good thing.
- It’s my thing that I do.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.710
Did you tell her
that it was my thing?

15:22.798 --> 15:26.131

give you credit?
- Yes. Did you?

15:26.218 --> 15:29.927

Not inured to death and mortality

16:19.354 --> 16:22.471
The pattern of this pitting—
I believe it resulted
from blowback.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.144
From a gunshot?
Most probably.

16:25.235 --> 16:28.602
The victim was shot with a gun,
and he was standing
in front of something glass.

and blew back

- 250 for legalese.

Look at this letter
right here.

by the victim.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.804

it’s written by him.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.386

Signed by him.

Mm-hmm.

- Mm-hmm. It’s a piece
from the sole of a shoe.

- No. His we matched
with DNA.

23:37.166 --> 23:40.294
Lance. I heard
you were here.
I’ve been calling.

23:40.378 --> 23:43.962
I know. Um—

23:44.048 --> 23:47.040
I’ve been busy doing
a lot of thinking, Daisy.

23:47.135 --> 23:49.922
About what?
I know something
is bothering you.

23:50.013 --> 23:52.095
You have to share it
with me.

23:52.223 --> 23:54.805
Uh, guys, I’m gonna leave.
No, you know what?

23:54.892 --> 23:57.554
We should work.
I’ll call you. I’ll call you.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.351
Okay. I’ll—

24:00.982 --> 24:02.518
Okay.

24:04.527 --> 24:07.018
What’s goin’ on, Sweets?

24:08.072 --> 24:09.983
You know, I only have
one life, Angela,

24:10.074 --> 24:12.656
and I don’t want
to play it safe, so—

24:12.744 --> 24:14.985
Now I’d really like to work.

24:15.079 --> 24:17.821
Okay.

24:19.292 --> 24:22.955
I can check these e-mail headers
to see who got these letters.

24:23.046 --> 24:25.378
Maybe it was some kind
of love affair gone wrong.

24:25.465 --> 24:29.208
Okay, the server
sent the message
to this I.P. address.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.964
- The remote desk top is open.
- Okay, whatjust happened?

24:32.055 --> 24:35.468
Uh, well, we now have
full control...

24:35.558 --> 24:37.469
over the computer
that received these e-mails.

24:37.602 --> 24:40.594
Whoa, what’d you just do?
Turned the Web cam on.

24:40.688 --> 24:43.521
Hey, that is the manager
at the subway station.

24:43.608 --> 24:46.771
Well, then, that is who Martin Aragon
sent the love letters to.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.026
[ Daisy]
Where we going?

24:53.117 --> 24:55.108
Uh, Cam asked me
to get you out of the lab.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.735
Why?
Because you keep sighing
and moaning.

24:57.872 --> 25:00.739
I thought I was
keeping that to myself.
No. No.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.787
You were sharing
with everyone.
Why do you drive a minivan?

25:03.920 --> 25:06.582
Do you have kids
that we don’t know about?
I’m an artist, Daisy.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.959
And the Sienna
has plenty of room.

25:09.050 --> 25:12.338
Plus, | stink at parallel parking,
and that back-up camera thing...

25:12.428 --> 25:15.920
is, like, the invention
of the century.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.344
So why are you sighing
and moaning, Daisy?

25:19.435 --> 25:22.177
Because—
Have you ever been dumped?

25:22.271 --> 25:23.932
[Chuckling]
Of course.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.851
Hasn’t everybody?
Not me.

25:25.942 --> 25:27.648
- Never?
- Never.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.475
I’m... smart.

25:29.570 --> 25:32.403
I’m extremely attractive.
Plus, I’m a sexual dynamo.

25:32.490 --> 25:34.321
Mmm.

25:34.409 --> 25:37.901
So, do you think that Sweets
is gonna break up with you?

25:37.995 --> 25:39.906
I don’t know, because
it’s never happened before.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.124
He ’3 pushing me away.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.957
He’s been avoiding me.
Oh.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.955
[ Scoffs ] You don’t have
anything to worry about.

25:47.046 --> 25:50.584
- Why?
- Because before
they break up with you,

25:50.675 --> 25:54.668
guys usually get
really affectionate and sweet.

25:54.762 --> 25:57.970
- Does it always happen like that?
- No. No, not always.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.922
So you can’t give me
any real help at all,

26:00.059 --> 26:03.722
even though
you’ve been dumped a lot.
Not a lot, Daisy.

26:03.813 --> 26:06.179
[ Sighs ]
Why would Lance
break up with me?

26:06.274 --> 26:08.185
I’m awesome!

26:11.028 --> 26:13.235
/ pa/d the dude
to write letters for me.

26:13.322 --> 26:14.937
Is that a crime?

26:15.032 --> 26:17.614
- To?
- Officer McKenna Grant.

26:17.702 --> 26:19.488
Officer Grant,

Yeah.

nowhere with her.

26:23.875 --> 26:27.083
She was all wrapped up
with this dude,
Eddie Ceraficki.

26:27.170 --> 26:30.162
Aragon said he could appeal
to her romantic side.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.121
- So you could close the deal.
- Yeah.

26:32.216 --> 26:33.877
She has a cute ass,
you know?

26:33.968 --> 26:35.833
/ thought maybe
that poetry stuff—
it could work.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.380
Right.
Right

26:37.472 --> 26:39.303
You are quite a romantic,
Colin.

26:39.390 --> 26:42.553
Tell you what though.
Martin Aragon was murdered.

26:42.643 --> 26:44.599
You’re kidding me.

26:44.687 --> 26:46.598
Try to look surprised, okay?
lt’ll help.

26:46.689 --> 26:48.350
I swear.
I had no idea.

26:49.567 --> 26:52.104
You know, maybe when
he wrote these letters to her—

26:52.195 --> 26:53.810
Yeah, yeah.
That’s what it is.

26:53.905 --> 26:55.691
Maybe when he wrote
these letters to her,

26:55.782 --> 26:57.568
he actually fell in love
with her himself.

26:57.658 --> 27:00.786
Why would I care?
As long as the letters worked.

27:00.870 --> 27:02.781
But those letters—
they didn’t work.

27:02.872 --> 27:05.739
And you, you shelled out a lot of money
for those letters, right?

27:05.833 --> 27:10.372
What do you end up with?
A blind guy who falls
in love with your girlfriend.

27:12.548 --> 27:15.039
That would make you pretty mad,
wouldn’t it?

27:17.845 --> 27:19.585
Am I right, Colin?

[A nge/a ]

talking about this.

27:28.648 --> 27:31.890
I mean, is this
because of something that
that Japanese journalist said?

27:31.984 --> 27:34.316
[Booth]
No, no, no, no, no, no.
it’s just R/ku asked Bones...

27:34.403 --> 27:36.655
about some of
the character stuff in her book,

27:36.739 --> 27:40.607
and when we were alone, Bones—
She told me you helped her.

27:40.701 --> 27:43.158
[ On Speakerphone ]
Yeah, lm/ght’ve given her
a few suggestions. That’s all.

27:43.246 --> 27:45.658
Suggestions like,
um, I don’t know. What?

27:45.748 --> 27:47.864
Okay, look, Brennan
types up her book,

27:47.959 --> 27:51.417
and then I go to her place
and I lie on the couch.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.415

with a glass of wine.

27:53.506 --> 27:56.748
And she reads me the book.

27:56.884 --> 28:00.422
Oh. Um, she reads you
the whole book?
Well, yeah.

28:00.513 --> 28:03.505
Yeah. And / say,
“You know what’d be
great here ?

28:03.599 --> 28:05.555
Uh, if they were naked.”

28:05.643 --> 28:09.761
Or, uh, what if he says this to her,
and they laugh and then they kiss?

28:09.856 --> 28:11.892
You know
That kind of stuff

28:12.024 --> 28:14.140
The good stuff you mean.
No. Do not do that, Booth.

28:14.235 --> 28:15.850
She writes the book.

28:15.945 --> 28:19.108

and make suggestions.
Like her editor.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.315
- And editors do not get credit.
- How about page 187?

28:22.410 --> 28:24.321
What is it with you guys
and page 187?

You recognize these?

28:33.713 --> 28:35.874
He wrote them to you,
didn’t he?
No.

28:35.965 --> 28:38.047
These letters were sent
to me by Colin Casey.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.750
Oh, Colin paid Martin Aragon
to write these.

28:42.430 --> 28:46.014
Well, he wasted his money,
’cause I only went out
with him a couple times.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.261
But you think
that maybe Colin...

28:48.352 --> 28:51.515
blamed the blind guy
for not sealing the deal?

28:51.606 --> 28:55.565
No. Sorry,
but Colin isn’t exactly
the tough guy type.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.812
Eddie maybe,
but not Colin.

28:57.945 --> 29:00.652
Eddie, your previous boyfriend?
Yeah. He, um—

29:00.740 --> 29:02.856
When / left Eddie for Colin,

29:02.950 --> 29:06.033
he came down and
punched Colin up a little bit.

29:06.120 --> 29:09.203
Not hospital punching, but
yeah, he knocked h/m around.

29:09.290 --> 29:12.077
What if Eddie found out that
Colin used the blind guy’s letters...

29:12.168 --> 29:14.625
to, uh, woo you away?

29:14.712 --> 29:16.623
Oh.

29:16.714 --> 29:19.706
Where would we find Eddie?

29:19.800 --> 29:22.212
He owns a pawn shop just above
Rock Creek station where I work.

29:22.303 --> 29:24.339
- is that how you met him?
- No. I met Eddie...

29:24.430 --> 29:26.546
when l arrested him
for carrying a concealed weapon.

29:28.059 --> 29:31.392
Yeah, I hear you.
I got issues with men.
Thanks for the update.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.016
This is a Ouasar safety slug.

29:35.107 --> 29:39.066
It was designed to disintegrate
so it won’t ricochet
after it hits its target.

29:39.153 --> 29:41.144
So it’s a safe bullet?

29:41.238 --> 29:43.615
Not for the person it hits.
Just anyone else
in the room.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.076
Now, this is a thin coating
of blue polymer.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.072
That must be what left marks
on the clavicle and C7.

29:49.163 --> 29:52.621
Perhaps, ’cause
the ammunition is so rare,
we could trace buyers.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.869
Well, we’re not done yet.
Now, turning our attention...

29:54.961 --> 29:58.169
to the glass fragments
embedded in the back
of our victim’s head—

29:58.255 --> 30:00.246
The bullet exited the victim,

30:00.341 --> 30:03.549
shattered a glass object behind him
before disintegrating.

30:03.636 --> 30:06.799
Right. The angle of applied force
was 28 degrees.

30:06.889 --> 30:09.005
So if I extend
the incidence lines,

30:09.100 --> 30:11.386
the point of intersection
was here.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.685
Which means he
was standing between
45 and 60 centimeters...

30:14.814 --> 30:17.726
in front of the glass object
when he was shot.
Okay.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.354
Then we find that glass
and we find
where he was killed.

30:20.444 --> 30:23.311
Well, we’re still not done.

30:23.406 --> 30:26.569
Hey! Those are my photographs
from when Dr. Hodgins and I
went to find the rat poop.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.570
Let’s not get emotional,
Miss Wick.

30:28.661 --> 30:33.576
Okay, so, we need
to find glass fixtures
that contain borosilicate.

30:33.708 --> 30:35.323
We find that here.
Mm-hmm.

30:35.418 --> 30:37.500
Now, I scanned for color
frequencies on the wall...

30:37.586 --> 30:39.417
where the bullet
would’ve disintegrated.

30:39.505 --> 30:43.669
The blue polymer emits
about 420 nanometers.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.920
You found
where he was murdered.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.378
He was lured
into this tunnel
and he was shot.

30:48.472 --> 30:51.930
Let the record show
that my photographs were
invaluable to the process.

30:53.561 --> 30:55.426

[Be/l Chimes]

in your first book,

31:08.117 --> 31:10.028

and Agent Andy...

in a two-man submarine.

31:31.432 --> 31:33.673
after being arrested
on a concealed-weapon charge?
That was a mistake.

31:33.768 --> 31:35.884
I accidentally put it
in my pocket, you know,
when I left work.

31:35.978 --> 31:38.185
Can we see the gun please?

31:38.272 --> 31:40.263

any sudden movements.
No mistakes.

- That is very sexy.

31:48.783 --> 31:52.150
Big Andy with a gun,
protecting Kathy

31:52.244 --> 31:55.361
No,no,no.
He is not Andy,
and I’m not Kathy.

31:55.456 --> 31:58.243
it’s even more exciting
when he shoots someone
with it.

31:58.334 --> 31:59.870
- Bones.
- Well, it is, Booth.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.372
- And impressive.
He never misses.
- Andy sometimes misses.

32:02.463 --> 32:04.749
- Yes. See?
- Sorry about that, pal.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.831
I get it.

32:06.926 --> 32:08.666
See that box of ammo
right there?

32:16.811 --> 32:18.802
Aha!

32:18.896 --> 32:22.059
- Gotcha, dirtbag!
- Got me for what?

32:22.149 --> 32:24.310
Don’t write that.
Don’t write “dirtbag.”

32:26.278 --> 32:28.394
What? Got him.

32:33.327 --> 32:36.069
Officer Grant says
you have quite a temper.

32:36.163 --> 32:38.996
Yeah. Well, guy starts
writing love letters
to your girlfriend,

32:39.083 --> 32:40.994
then she dumps you for him?

32:41.085 --> 32:43.121
He’s gonna get
a pop in the nose.
It’s practically the law, right?

32:43.212 --> 32:45.077
Yeah. Right.
So, you punch him
in the nose.

32:45.214 --> 32:46.704
That’s fine.
Thank you.

32:46.799 --> 32:49.165

that it wasn’t Colin Casey
who wrote the letters.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.921
What? He admitted it.

32:51.011 --> 32:53.297
No. No, no, no.
He hired someone else
to write the letters.

32:53.389 --> 32:55.926
You find that out, then
you get really pissed off
and you shoot him.

32:56.016 --> 32:58.598
- Who?
- Martin Aragon. The guy who
actually wrote the letters.

32:58.686 --> 33:01.143
Whoa. Wait, wait.
So she dumped me
for another guy?

33:01.272 --> 33:03.388
No, she dumps you for Colin.
All right, now I’m confused.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.440
The point of all this
is that we have
your fancy blue bullets...

33:06.527 --> 33:08.313
and the gun,
and we know where
you shot him.

33:08.404 --> 33:11.396
I never shot my gun.
I told you already.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.697
Okay? I might
wave it around
from time to time...

if some bad-lookin’ dude
comes in myjoint,
but I never shot it.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.868
And plus, I’m sure
you figured out...

33:18.956 --> 33:20.912
that those blue bullets
don’t fit in that gun.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.288
- Guy could have two guns.
- Who are you sayin’
I killed again?

33:24.378 --> 33:26.960
If you have nothin’ to hide,
why don’t you just
show me the gun...

33:27.047 --> 33:29.129

these fancy blue bullets.

33:31.218 --> 33:33.129
Okay, let the record show
that the suspect acted...

33:33.220 --> 33:35.302
very suspiciously
when | asked him
to produce the weapon.

33:35.389 --> 33:38.597
No. Wait. Okay.

33:39.894 --> 33:42.601
- I gave the gun to somebody.
- Who?

33:42.688 --> 33:45.179
She said I was
a stiff sometimes.
All right?

33:45.274 --> 33:49.267
Bonng,lguess.

thanks for coming in.

Can I have
your sidearm, please?

34:11.675 --> 34:13.586

You’re a law-enforcement
professional.

34:31.904 --> 34:34.441
Why would you keep
the murder weapon?

34:34.531 --> 34:36.237
I am a law enforcement
professional,

34:36.325 --> 34:39.658
and if you had any evidence
that wasn’t circumstantial,
you’d have arrested me.

34:39.745 --> 34:43.237

It’s been a pleasure.

for one second, please.

with the victim’s tissue...

34:59.348 --> 35:01.009

35:01.100 --> 35:03.261
If we can match this leather
to your shoes,

35:03.352 --> 35:05.638
it’ll show that you were there
when the victim died.

not only a timeline,
