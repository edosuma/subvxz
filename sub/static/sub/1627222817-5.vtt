WEBVTT

00:04.220 --> 00:06.100
It's me? It's me. It's me.

00:06.100 --> 00:08.380
This way.

00:08.380 --> 00:09.540
Quick.

00:10.900 --> 00:12.780
Call Ship Control, tell them

00:12.780 --> 00:15.420
to bring the submarine to emergency
stations for an airborne hazard.

00:15.420 --> 00:16.820
Go, Amy, quick.

00:16.820 --> 00:18.860
Don't let anyone through this door.

00:25.580 --> 00:27.900
Ship Control. This is DCI Silva.

00:27.900 --> 00:30.100
Cox'n says to bring
the submarine to emergency

00:30.100 --> 00:31.620
stations for an airborne hazard.

00:31.620 --> 00:33.260
Roger. Where? The missile decks.

00:33.260 --> 00:35.700
Roger, missile compartments.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.300
 Evacuate the missile
compartment, all levels.

00:39.700 --> 00:43.420
Don EBS in the missile compartment.
Shut bulkhead doors.

00:43.420 --> 00:46.260
Evacuate the missile compartment,
all levels.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.900
Clear this deck! Clear the deck!

00:50.900 --> 00:53.540
Emergency stations.
Airborne hazard...

00:53.540 --> 00:57.380
I want you all out! Clear the deck!

00:57.380 --> 00:59.500
Up the stairs, clear this deck!
Clear the deck!

00:59.500 --> 01:01.860
Airborne hazard in the
missile compartment.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.300
Shut bulkhead doors.

01:07.380 --> 01:09.740
Right, this level's clear.
Close that door.

01:09.740 --> 01:12.020
Sir, what's going on?
Just close the door!

01:13.500 --> 01:15.300
Will you pick that up for me?

01:17.340 --> 01:19.100
Ship Control, it's the Cox'n.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.740
There's a problem in the galley
stores.

01:20.740 --> 01:23.100
I think it's gas.
Jackie Hamilton's dead.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.620
Roger. Report to the Control Room.
Yeah. Roger that. OK.

01:25.620 --> 01:26.940
What did you see?

01:26.940 --> 01:30.140
Something got sprayed on her
and then she just began to vomit
and now she's... Shit.

01:30.140 --> 01:32.380
You need to wash straight away.
I have to report all this.

01:32.380 --> 01:35.420
If it's on your clothes, you could
end up poisoning someone.

01:36.780 --> 01:40.460
Doward, go to the galley
and get me a bag, please. Sir.

01:48.180 --> 01:50.940
Isolate the missile compartment.
Aye, sir.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.700
Hadlow, get me
visual confirmation that the

01:52.700 --> 01:55.100
ventilation in the missile
compartment has been shut down.

01:55.100 --> 01:56.380
Yes, sir.

01:56.380 --> 01:59.180
Get the Cox'n to report to the
Control Room at the rush.

02:11.220 --> 02:13.660
Stand and watch from a distance.
Don't let anyone come near that.

02:13.660 --> 02:16.500
Call the medic and tell her to
meet us at the shower block.

02:20.020 --> 02:22.460
Did anyone see you go in there?
Ship Control, Doward here...

02:22.460 --> 02:25.420
Amy, I know how you speak to people.
Please don't talk to me like that.

02:25.420 --> 02:27.780
Not now. I need to ask you some
questions. I didn't do anything.

02:27.780 --> 02:30.300
If I'd have wanted you dead, I would
have left you standing there.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.540
As soon as you're cleaned up,
we need to talk.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.580
Best keep a distance.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.780
OK. You should decontaminate as
well.

02:37.780 --> 02:40.340
Shower in your clothes for two
minutes, then double bag them.

02:40.340 --> 02:43.060
Do another ten, with lots of soap.
And then come and see me.

02:43.060 --> 02:44.700
Yeah.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.460
Do you think it's a nerve agent?
Like sarin?

02:47.460 --> 02:49.020
I don't know.

02:49.020 --> 02:51.820
It happened so fast, but...
it has to be.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.540
# Do you want me on your mind?

03:05.540 --> 03:10.820
# Or do you want me to go on?

03:14.380 --> 03:20.180
# I might be yours as sure as I can
say

03:21.220 --> 03:24.660
# Be gone, be far away

03:28.180 --> 03:32.980
# Ooh, ooh, ooh

03:35.180 --> 03:40.340
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh... #

04:38.900 --> 04:41.940
I can just about see
the top of your head.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.460
You're like an iceberg.

04:43.460 --> 04:45.100
90% of you hidden away.

04:46.980 --> 04:49.060
And are you my Titanic?

04:49.060 --> 04:51.100
It feels a bit that way, sometimes.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.220
Do you want to go away this summer?
Like, properly away?

05:00.060 --> 05:02.300
Yeah, OK.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.860
Do you even want to?

05:03.860 --> 05:06.020
I said OK.

05:06.020 --> 05:07.620
Ugh! What?

05:07.620 --> 05:09.300
Nothing! I give up.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.460
What? What have I said?

05:10.460 --> 05:11.860
No, you haven't said anything.

05:11.860 --> 05:13.740
You haven't said anything.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.700
Better clean under your fingernails.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.340
In and around your ears.

05:55.340 --> 05:57.060
Rinse out your nostrils.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.740
What happens if I get sick?

06:03.740 --> 06:07.220
For a nerve agent, you'd need
atropine and pralidoxime.

06:07.220 --> 06:09.180
We don't have either of them.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.460
Can I just say
I'm sorry I've been such a prick?

06:25.020 --> 06:26.660
OK, that's ten minutes.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.300
I need to check your pupils.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.700
Eyes open. Look straight ahead.

06:41.260 --> 06:42.820
Windows to the soul, eh?

06:42.820 --> 06:45.380
Yeah, we know that's not in good
shape.

07:03.860 --> 07:05.540
That's the last time.

07:23.180 --> 07:24.540
Morning.

07:24.540 --> 07:26.180
I've been thinking about the Navy.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.780
Sorry, did I wake you?

07:27.780 --> 07:30.060
Doesn't matter. Go on.

07:30.060 --> 07:32.900
The Navy isn't making much progress
looking for a traitor.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.220
It's on us.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.940
Yeah, but Ingles left us
nothing to go on!

07:36.940 --> 07:38.380
Not even a phone number.

07:38.380 --> 07:41.820
True, but there has to be someone
still in Scotland who knows

07:41.820 --> 07:43.420
who Ingles' assets were.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.820
He was here a long time.

07:44.820 --> 07:46.460
He would have built up networks.

07:46.460 --> 07:48.460
Some of them might still be active.

07:48.460 --> 07:51.020
Some of them might even
have recruited people.

07:51.020 --> 07:52.740
We've got to keep at it, Porter.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.340
Talk to his neighbours.

07:54.340 --> 07:57.700
Pull CCTV from the shops
around his flat, OK?

07:57.700 --> 08:01.260
Amy is down there all on her own
and she has no idea what's coming.

08:03.060 --> 08:05.380
Get as many people
as you can onto that.

08:05.380 --> 08:07.620
I've got to do something first
and then I'll be in.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.300
Can I have my breakfast?

08:09.300 --> 08:10.780
No, you can't.

08:17.060 --> 08:21.180
So, after I heard the broadcast,
I went to the galley crew. They said

08:21.180 --> 08:23.900
that Jackie had just nipped out,
so then I went to the galley stores.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.860
So her crew told you
she was going to the stores?

08:25.860 --> 08:29.300
No, but she was on watch
and she wasn't using the heads,
so I just assumed she'd be there.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.500
The what? The heads, the toilets.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.500
I checked. The entire midsection of
the boat is sealed off.
Look straight ahead.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.100
This is not sustainable,
so I just need the basic facts.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.380
What did you see when you got there?

08:39.380 --> 08:42.780
Erm... Jackie had the lid off a big
tin

08:42.780 --> 08:44.460
and there was gas coming out of it.

08:44.460 --> 08:47.060
Is there any chance she could have
opened that by accident?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.580
Oh, I don't know. It's hard to say.

08:49.580 --> 08:50.780
I don't know.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.980
And after Jackie told you to
get away, what did you do?

08:53.980 --> 08:55.820
She was scared.

08:55.820 --> 08:59.220
And then I think she said,
"Tell Sean I couldn't."

08:59.220 --> 09:01.420
Hand, please. Sean's Jackie's son.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.580
And then she started to vomit.

09:03.580 --> 09:06.420
And that's when I went
and got the gas mask.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.900
Then when I came back, DCI Silva was
already standing there

09:10.900 --> 09:12.620
so I got her to safety

09:12.620 --> 09:15.540
and Jackie was already dead.

09:15.540 --> 09:18.180
It killed her that quickly?
Yes, sir.

09:18.180 --> 09:21.580
Look, I saw she'd passed out.
She'd wet herself, she'd vomited.

09:21.580 --> 09:23.140
There was some foaming round the
mouth.

09:23.140 --> 09:25.740
That's the same
presentation as Craig Burke.

09:25.740 --> 09:28.700
We think it's a nerve agent,
like sarin.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.220
You need to look for delayed
symptoms of exposure.

09:31.220 --> 09:33.620
Muscle twitches, a runny nose,
you come and see me immediately.

09:33.620 --> 09:34.740
Yes, Ma'am.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.380
Did Jackie manage to
contain this thing?

09:37.380 --> 09:39.700
There's, like, a box thrown over it.

09:39.700 --> 09:43.460
So we've got nerve gas leaking
across the entire missile
compartment.

09:43.460 --> 09:46.580
That takes out missile control
and the comms wire.

09:46.580 --> 09:48.220
And we can't feed the crew.

09:48.220 --> 09:51.500
Is the storeroom a logical location
to set off an attack like this?

09:51.500 --> 09:54.020
I suppose you'd never look
for it in the galley stores.

09:54.020 --> 09:55.660
She was going to see her son again.

09:55.660 --> 09:57.540
Why would she do something like
that?

09:57.540 --> 10:01.300
OK, so Jackie knew enough about what
was going on to tell you to get out.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.100
Exactly. She told him to get away.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.220
That's someone trying to save
a life, not kill them.

10:05.220 --> 10:06.500
Thank you, everyone.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.300
Lieutenant Surgeon, Cox'n, I'll need
you in the wardroom.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.780
I want to reinstate Prentice.

10:10.780 --> 10:12.380
I think I'll need him.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.700
If you have any objection to that,
you need to tell me now.

10:14.700 --> 10:17.060
I don't have a problem,
but I think you need me.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.100
Are you well enough?

10:20.100 --> 10:22.700
Lt Docherty gave me some medication.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.500
It's not a substitute, but it will
take the edge off withdrawal.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.660
Yes, I feel fine.

11:12.420 --> 11:15.180
Hello, are you Poppy? Yes.

11:15.180 --> 11:17.540
Is it your birthday today? Yes.

11:17.540 --> 11:19.580
Is that for me? Yes, it is.

11:19.580 --> 11:21.900
Happy birthday. It's from Amy.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.340
Is she here?!

11:23.340 --> 11:25.620
She really wanted to be here.

11:25.620 --> 11:27.380
She's on a submarine.

11:27.380 --> 11:30.020
It's for work and they haven't let
her off just yet.

11:30.020 --> 11:33.060
Poppy, you don't answer
the door by yourself!

11:33.060 --> 11:34.180
Mrs Torrens, hi.

11:34.180 --> 11:36.900
I don't mean to intrude -
I was just dropping off a present.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.900
What's all this?
Amy's on a submarine.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.220
Is she, now?

11:42.980 --> 11:45.900
Come and have some tea,
we're sitting out the back.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.300
Thank you, but I can't stay.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.780
Have one for the road.

11:51.980 --> 11:53.460
Come on. OK.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.940
Amy would have gotten you
something much better.

12:01.940 --> 12:03.300
This is really cool.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.820
Will she come and see me
when she's back?

12:05.820 --> 12:07.540
Well, I'm sure she'd love that.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.540
Oh, let me help.

12:11.540 --> 12:13.420
Oh, thank you kindly! Of course.

12:13.420 --> 12:15.420
You might take a leaf from her book,
Poppy.

12:15.420 --> 12:16.780
I knew who you were.

12:16.780 --> 12:18.380
Do you want to know how?

12:18.380 --> 12:20.180
How?

12:20.180 --> 12:22.300
Photos on Amy's phone.

12:22.300 --> 12:23.820
I know her passcode.

12:23.820 --> 12:27.500
We do chat to Amy,
from time to time.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.780
I love Amy.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.500
She loves you.

12:32.860 --> 12:34.900
She should come over more.

12:34.900 --> 12:37.100
Why don't you go and play
in your room now, Poppy?

12:37.100 --> 12:38.500
I don't want to.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.460
Maybe I should get going.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.740
Off you pop.

12:41.740 --> 12:44.140
I need a grown-up word with Kirsten.

12:44.140 --> 12:45.620
OK. Go on.

12:50.900 --> 12:55.060
If we're looking at joint custody,
I'd like to know who you are,

12:55.060 --> 12:58.780
and I'm sorry to be direct,
but she's my only grandchild.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.220
I feel I have a right to ask.

13:00.220 --> 13:01.420
What? I'm sorry?

13:01.420 --> 13:02.780
Morag...

13:02.780 --> 13:05.940
No, I don't know anything
about joint custody.

13:07.060 --> 13:09.060
Four months spent talking about it

13:09.060 --> 13:11.420
and she's never even discussed it
with her partner!

13:11.420 --> 13:14.340
Part...? Amy and I aren't together.

13:14.340 --> 13:16.060
We broke up.

13:17.620 --> 13:19.460
Well, she never mentioned that.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.820
I know Amy missed Poppy a lot.

13:25.820 --> 13:27.420
I mean, when we were together.

13:27.420 --> 13:29.420
She lost her dad.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.900
We were never being unkind -
we just didn't want her going back

13:31.900 --> 13:34.100
and forth between Amy and us.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.140
She needed stability.

13:36.140 --> 13:38.940
But then Poppy got very depressed.

13:38.940 --> 13:42.340
Told her teacher that she'd been
taken away from her mother.

13:42.340 --> 13:45.140
They're not together.
She doesn't need to hear this.

13:47.820 --> 13:50.020
I really have to go. Thank you.
No, no...

13:50.020 --> 13:54.340
Please...
Say goodbye before you go.

13:54.340 --> 13:56.940
She won't forgive us if you don't.

13:56.940 --> 13:58.500
Of course.

14:06.740 --> 14:08.540
My grandma's so annoying.

14:09.860 --> 14:13.460
Well, people generally are a bit
annoying.

14:17.820 --> 14:20.580
I'm sorry it was me
here today and not Amy.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.780
That's OK.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.540
She'll come see you
as soon as she's back.

14:47.980 --> 14:49.740
Just feels like you're pushing me.

14:49.740 --> 14:52.300
I don't mean to push you,
it's just that you said that you'd

14:52.300 --> 14:54.820
introduce me and it's been months.
I said I needed some time. Time?!

14:54.820 --> 14:56.820
How much fucking time do you
need, Amy? Kirsten, don't.

14:56.820 --> 14:59.020
Are you ashamed of me? What?

14:59.020 --> 15:00.540
Are you ashamed of this?

15:00.540 --> 15:02.860
Why can't you be honest with me?

15:02.860 --> 15:04.460
Stop telling me what I can't do.

15:04.460 --> 15:06.740
You just take everything
so personally.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.460
Morning. Morning, sir.

15:15.460 --> 15:18.100
We've evidence that Russia is
mounting an operation against Vigil.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.540
A plot to sabotage her
ventilation systems,

15:20.540 --> 15:22.820
force her to the surface,
where she's a sitting duck,

15:22.820 --> 15:24.180
and they can take her out if they
need to.

15:24.180 --> 15:25.500
Does Commander Newsome know this?

15:25.500 --> 15:28.220
Don't know. We ordered Vigil to
respond, but we haven't heard from
her.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.260
It's been over 12 hours,
so now we need to find her.

15:30.260 --> 15:32.900
Harney, you take Audacious
north of the patrol area.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.860
Fleming, you take Archer south.

15:34.860 --> 15:37.420
If we find Vigil surfaced, we'll
need to be prepared to defend her.

15:37.420 --> 15:40.140
Miller, we need to get your boat out
to sea and it has to be today.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.980
Sir, half the scrubbers are in
refit.

15:41.980 --> 15:43.420
Take her out under escort.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.780
We know they'll be watching,
that's a good thing.

15:45.780 --> 15:48.220
They need to understand that
whatever is going on with Vigil,

15:48.220 --> 15:49.700
the deterrent remains operative.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.100
Currently, that's not the case.

15:51.100 --> 15:52.620
Thank you. Ready your crews.

15:52.620 --> 15:54.700
Yes, sir. What can we tell them?

15:54.700 --> 15:57.100
It's a drill, isn't it?
It's always a drill.

16:02.660 --> 16:06.700
We now think Craig Burke was killed
using a nerve agent.

16:06.700 --> 16:10.020
It would seem that Jackie Hamilton
was responsible for his murder,

16:10.020 --> 16:12.100
as well as today's attack.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.380
Jackie's dead.

16:13.380 --> 16:16.140
She got exposed when she tried to
set this device off.

16:16.140 --> 16:18.580
The missile compartments
have been sealed off,

16:18.580 --> 16:21.380
but we need to assume that they
are being filled with nerve gas.

16:21.380 --> 16:24.020
How's Jackie meant to be
doing all that?

16:24.020 --> 16:26.460
Jackie's son was in prison
in Indonesia on drugs charges,

16:26.460 --> 16:27.900
but he'd recently been released,

16:27.900 --> 16:30.940
so it's possible she could have
done some kind of deal.

16:30.940 --> 16:33.940
A deal with who? Someone who can
pull strings in Indonesia

16:33.940 --> 16:35.700
and has access to nerve agents.

16:35.700 --> 16:38.340
So, what, that's Russia?
China, maybe?

16:38.340 --> 16:41.340
Why would that involve Burke?
Are you sure that she killed him?

16:41.340 --> 16:43.100
I found contamination
in Jackie's bunk,

16:43.100 --> 16:45.420
which links her to the nerve agent
which killed Burke,

16:45.420 --> 16:47.940
and we know that he visited the mess
just before he died.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.500
So you think she poisoned him then?

16:49.500 --> 16:50.780
He wasn't seen eating then,

16:50.780 --> 16:54.060
but she could have slipped him
something without being noticed.

16:55.340 --> 16:59.820
Mm. What we have to focus on now is
why the nerve agent is here.

16:59.820 --> 17:02.820
We should assume this is
a nation-state attack.

17:02.820 --> 17:05.740
I want the crew focused, so we'll
tell them as little as possible -

17:05.740 --> 17:07.980
that Jackie's died.
No more than that.

17:07.980 --> 17:12.140
At present, we're not able to
receive orders, nor can we fire.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.420
Our enemy has succeeded in knocking
out Britain's nuclear deterrent.

17:18.580 --> 17:21.860
Our job is to fight back...

17:24.100 --> 17:26.060
..and restore it.

17:26.060 --> 17:27.300
I want your ideas.

17:34.500 --> 17:38.540
Bleach is used for basic
decontamination of nerve agents.

17:38.540 --> 17:42.460
My chemistry is a bit rusty, but
I'm pretty sure that hypochlorite

17:42.460 --> 17:44.020
breaks it down and neutralises it.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.460
It's being sprayed as a gas.

17:45.460 --> 17:48.980
If we isolate the fire sprinklers
in the missile decks,

17:48.980 --> 17:52.460
fill the pumps with bleach
and boost the water pressure,

17:52.460 --> 17:55.260
we might be able to get some
sort of bleach vapour going.

17:55.260 --> 17:57.180
We can't have the crew breathing
that in, either.

17:57.180 --> 17:58.580
Vent it afterwards.

17:58.580 --> 18:01.100
It's a bodge, but maybe it'll be
enough for someone to

18:01.100 --> 18:03.740
work in there in basic protection?
OK, good.

18:03.740 --> 18:06.380
That still doesn't stop
the device itself, does it?

18:06.380 --> 18:08.820
We still have to work out how we get
to it and then get rid of it.

18:08.820 --> 18:09.900
What about the hazmat suits?

18:09.900 --> 18:12.020
No,
those are kept in the middle stores.

18:12.020 --> 18:14.300
Next to the galley
stores in the contaminated area.

18:14.300 --> 18:17.260
OK, what about the deep-diving
suits? They're at least in this
section.

18:17.260 --> 18:19.900
Contain the device, clean it,
flush it out of the torpedo tubes.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.100
I realise, you know, the suits
aren't designed for that,

18:22.100 --> 18:24.820
but a quick run might do
the trick, mightn't it?
You'd have to be very fast.

18:24.820 --> 18:27.500
Without being immersed in sea water,
there's nothing to cool you down.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.100
How long would you have?

18:29.100 --> 18:31.260
I'd say you've got about 15
minutes before you're at risk

18:31.260 --> 18:34.100
of heatstroke.
And we'd also need to create some
kind of decontamination

18:34.100 --> 18:36.340
area for when they come back
through the bulkhead doors.

18:36.340 --> 18:37.900
We can rig something up, sir.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.060
Do it.
Thank you, everyone.

18:40.060 --> 18:41.340
Carry on.

18:43.140 --> 18:44.540
I'm glad you're with us, XO.

18:45.660 --> 18:47.220
Thank you, sir.

18:49.060 --> 18:52.420
So what do you need? I'm going to go
and see Jackie's crew. OK. Let me
take you.

18:52.420 --> 18:54.460
No. I'm going to go on my own. All
right, look, I lied about Tiffany.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.420
I didn't behave well there,
but if you think I've got anything
to do with this...

18:57.420 --> 19:00.860
You told the Captain that I was
mentally unfit. And now you're
telling me what I think.

19:00.860 --> 19:04.940
Amy, I'm sorry. Do you mind?
Please. I don't need to hear your
excuses. I just want to do my job.

19:04.940 --> 19:07.380
Look, Amy, I'm sorry
and I'm trying to help you.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.740
The Captain's got his hands full.

19:08.740 --> 19:10.500
Look, do you think anyone
else is going to?

19:10.500 --> 19:12.100
Believe me, I'm aware of that.

19:13.740 --> 19:15.340
Did anyone tell you about the RCMS?

19:15.340 --> 19:16.700
What's the RCMS?

19:20.180 --> 19:22.740
It's a dial that overrides
the reactor

19:22.740 --> 19:24.300
manually in the event
of an emergency.

19:24.300 --> 19:27.100
Now, it's usually kept padlocked
and only three people have the key.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.460
The engineers.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.660
But they were all there, so
they know that nobody took the key.

19:31.660 --> 19:34.140
Anyway, after the scram,
they went over things.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.580
But there were no leaks, no errors.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.940
But then
when Walsh looks at the padlock,

19:38.940 --> 19:41.260
he sees that it's
covered in scratch marks.

19:41.260 --> 19:45.100
They think someone's jimmied
the lock, which makes it sabotage.

19:47.140 --> 19:49.900
Remember, it almost forced us
to surface.

19:50.820 --> 19:53.420
Now, in the event of a gas leak
attack, what are we forced to do

19:53.420 --> 19:56.060
when people start to get sick?
Evacuate.

19:56.060 --> 19:57.620
Well, surface and evacuate.

19:57.620 --> 19:59.260
So there is a pattern forming here.

19:59.260 --> 20:00.820
Have you told the Captain all of
that?

20:00.820 --> 20:03.100
Yeah, of course, but he's trying to
get the patrol back on track.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.380
But the why of things, that's you.

20:05.380 --> 20:07.180
And we all need you doing that.

20:07.180 --> 20:09.020
So please, just let me help you.

20:12.180 --> 20:13.660
Come on.

20:38.060 --> 20:39.620
All bookings get logged.

20:39.620 --> 20:42.140
Do you know if this guy's
a season-ticket holder?

20:42.140 --> 20:43.700
All I've got for you is a name.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.300
Peter Ingles.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.220
I-n-g-l-e-s.

20:47.220 --> 20:48.460
OK.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.380
So...

20:50.380 --> 20:53.340
At least his name's not
Smith or Brown!

20:53.340 --> 20:57.140
I, n, g, l, e, s.

20:57.140 --> 20:59.060
Yep, you're in luck.

20:59.060 --> 21:03.100
Peter Ingles is on both our ticket
and marketing lists.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.740
Season-ticket holder.

21:04.740 --> 21:07.060
Looks like he's been to quite a few
games over the years.

21:07.060 --> 21:09.300
How many years?
Five.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.100
Is that his telephone number there?

21:12.100 --> 21:13.620
Yep. Oh, amazing.

21:16.180 --> 21:18.700
Is Mr Ingles in trouble, then?

21:18.700 --> 21:20.700
No.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.420
Nothing's going to happen to him.

21:25.260 --> 21:28.140
That there, what does that mean?

21:28.140 --> 21:31.420
With a season ticket, you get two
free guest passes per year.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.340
That says he used one this season.

21:33.340 --> 21:35.580
Do you keep details of the people
that come as guests?

21:35.580 --> 21:37.140
No, it's pretty basic.

21:38.180 --> 21:40.740
Could you print me out the dates for
the games where he did take a guest?

21:40.740 --> 21:43.380
Yep, no problem.
Thank you.

21:47.180 --> 21:49.700
Do you keep CCTV from the entrances?

21:49.700 --> 21:51.500
Only for a week.

21:51.500 --> 21:52.980
Are the games recorded at all?

21:52.980 --> 21:55.660
Yeah, they're all broadcast live,

21:55.660 --> 22:00.580
but your problem's going to be his
seat if you're wanting to spot him.

22:00.580 --> 22:03.420
So he's had the same seat for every
match he's ever been to?

22:03.420 --> 22:04.620
That's right.

22:06.740 --> 22:07.980
Thank you.

22:07.980 --> 22:09.660
Did you get the dates
I sent through?

22:09.660 --> 22:11.060
Yeah, just came through now.

22:11.060 --> 22:12.980
And a seating plan of the arena.

22:12.980 --> 22:14.340
What's that about?

22:14.340 --> 22:17.260
We now know the nine games Ingles
took a guest to,

22:17.260 --> 22:19.780
and we know exactly
where in the arena he was sitting.

22:19.780 --> 22:21.820
And we know what he looks like.

22:21.820 --> 22:24.660
Forget official cameras, people
take their own pictures at games

22:24.660 --> 22:27.020
don't they?
Selfies, bits of video, all sorts.

22:27.020 --> 22:28.580
On it.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.420
Run his phone number as well.
Done it.

22:30.420 --> 22:32.060
Right, great. I'm coming in.

22:36.580 --> 22:38.780
Were you working in here
when the reactor scrammed?

22:38.780 --> 22:41.140
Yeah.
Power went down.

22:41.140 --> 22:43.060
Had to change the whole menu.

22:43.060 --> 22:45.900
You can't run
the ovens on emergency power.

22:45.900 --> 22:47.420
Was Jackie in here when it happened?

22:47.420 --> 22:48.620
Not in that moment.

22:48.620 --> 22:50.300
But maybe a minute later.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.100
Are you sure about that?

22:52.100 --> 22:54.460
Could it have been longer
than a minute?

22:54.460 --> 22:55.660
Maybe.

22:55.660 --> 23:00.180
Busy service, you know?
But no more than, like, five.

23:00.180 --> 23:02.300
Do you know where she went?
She's the boss.

23:02.300 --> 23:03.780
She don't have to say.

23:07.100 --> 23:10.540
Would she have had time
to get from the RCMS back to here?

23:10.540 --> 23:12.820
It's more than a minute.
Five, maybe.

23:12.820 --> 23:15.300
But you'd be running all the way.

23:15.300 --> 23:18.740
When she left the galley this
morning, how did she seem, like,

23:18.740 --> 23:21.460
did you notice anything
different about her?

23:21.460 --> 23:26.060
I mean, she was different
cos of her kid getting out.

23:26.060 --> 23:30.100
She was happy about it, then
she's all over the place.

23:30.100 --> 23:33.380
And then she's fucking dead
and she won't see him again.

23:37.620 --> 23:41.140
That's the most unfair thing
I've ever heard.

23:41.140 --> 23:42.580
Anything else? No.

23:44.740 --> 23:49.180
I was thinking maybe we could get a
collection together for her family?

23:49.180 --> 23:51.060
That's a nice idea.

23:51.060 --> 23:55.460
Why don't you come
and see me about it tomorrow?

23:55.460 --> 23:57.220
It doesn't make sense.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.540
I need to look at the scene.

24:06.660 --> 24:09.220
We could move
supplies across the hull?

24:09.220 --> 24:10.780
We can't risk surfacing.

24:10.780 --> 24:13.220
There's a good chance that's
the strategy all along.

24:13.220 --> 24:14.660
Force us up.

24:14.660 --> 24:17.260
Doward, how busy is it up there?

24:17.260 --> 24:19.700
Fairly clear, sir.
Nothing for about 40 miles.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.460
What is it?

24:24.460 --> 24:27.380
Sir, DCI Silva would like to use
one of the dive suits to assess

24:27.380 --> 24:29.220
the scene.

24:29.220 --> 24:31.940
I can see how you'd want that,
but we only have two dry suits

24:31.940 --> 24:34.580
and you're not the priority.
I'd also like to volunteer, sir.

24:34.580 --> 24:36.300
I was down there when it happened.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.700
So I know what I'm looking for.

24:37.700 --> 24:40.020
It would only take one of us
to collect the hazmat suits.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.780
I could do that
while DCI Silva does her work.

24:42.780 --> 24:46.540
Then we can both
dispose of the device together.

24:46.540 --> 24:48.060
Wardroom.

24:48.060 --> 24:50.020
I can give you three minutes.

24:55.900 --> 24:58.020
There's just so much that
doesn't add up.

24:58.020 --> 25:01.020
Why Jackie set off the nerve gas
where she did.
Killing herself in the process.

25:01.020 --> 25:03.580
And we have some questions around
the sabotage of the RCMS panels.

25:03.580 --> 25:06.860
We've spoken to the galley crew -
we don't think she would have had
time to scram the reactor.

25:06.860 --> 25:09.460
I need to assess the scene before it
gets soaked in bleach.

25:09.460 --> 25:12.860
I need experienced crew in those dry
suits, to neutralise the device.

25:12.860 --> 25:14.820
Yeah,
I can assist with that.

25:16.220 --> 25:19.020
And this will be a very challenging
environment. I'm aware of that.

25:19.020 --> 25:20.980
Sir, I can vouch for DCI Silva.

25:20.980 --> 25:22.060
She's capable.

25:24.620 --> 25:27.540
I've been making her life very
difficult over the past few days -

25:27.540 --> 25:29.740
and so
if she's reacted badly to that,

25:29.740 --> 25:31.660
then I take full responsibility.

25:31.660 --> 25:35.180
I was just trying to
cover my own arse, because...

25:35.180 --> 25:38.260
..I've been having an affair with
another member of the crew.

25:41.820 --> 25:43.340
I see.

25:45.620 --> 25:47.500
Well, Cox'n.

25:47.500 --> 25:48.980
Welcome to the fuck-ups club.

25:48.980 --> 25:51.500
We'll deal with that when we get
back on land. Sir.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.060
DCI Silva, carry on.

25:53.060 --> 25:55.100
So there's a pattern here.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.540
Burke gets killed.

25:56.540 --> 25:57.980
The reactor gets scrammed.

25:57.980 --> 25:59.340
And then this device gets set off.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.700
That's three attempts to force this
submarine to surface.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.300
The first one worked,

26:03.300 --> 26:05.540
because you had to pick me
up along with Burke's replacement.

26:05.540 --> 26:07.140
What's a fourth attempt
going to look like?

26:07.140 --> 26:08.500
Well, Jackie's dead, so...

26:08.500 --> 26:10.100
But we can't be sure that's
the end of it.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.300
Not until we know how
and why this happened.

26:12.300 --> 26:15.060
The only way that I can do that is
by assessing the crime scene.

26:15.060 --> 26:18.860
And if I don't get access now,
vital evidence could be lost.

26:20.340 --> 26:22.980
God, the lives of your crew
could depend on it.

26:26.540 --> 26:29.420
Be ready to go by the time Hadlow's
set up his decontamination tent.

26:29.420 --> 26:30.740
Thank you.

26:30.740 --> 26:33.460
Remember, Lt Docherty said
you had a maximum of 15

26:33.460 --> 26:35.580
minutes before you pass
out in your own sweat.

26:35.580 --> 26:38.260
There'll be nobody to come in
and pull you out.

26:38.260 --> 26:40.700
I need that device secured
and off my boat.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.540
And I need those hazmat suits.

26:42.540 --> 26:44.420
Anything else is a lower priority.

26:44.420 --> 26:45.820
Those are my orders.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.140
Hey. Hey.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.660
Digital forensics are on it.

27:01.660 --> 27:03.940
Geo-tagged posts,
matched image searches,

27:03.940 --> 27:05.580
going through all the social
media networks.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.780
MI5's putting
their resources into it.

27:07.780 --> 27:10.540
We've got Drever messaging anyone
who's ever posted photos from that

27:10.540 --> 27:13.580
part of the arena, asking them to
send us everything else they've got.
Good.

27:13.580 --> 27:15.140
Are people responding? Yes.

27:15.140 --> 27:17.180
And Robertson's
talking to the club as well.

27:17.180 --> 27:19.700
He's trying to get a hold
of the details for anyone with seats

27:19.700 --> 27:22.060
with a view of F block.
And we've got Ingles once already.

27:22.060 --> 27:24.740
Do we know who
he was sitting next to?

27:24.740 --> 27:25.860
Not yet.

27:25.860 --> 27:28.140
Forensics reckon
they can clean it up a bit.

27:28.140 --> 27:29.820
We found Ingles again on Facebook.

27:29.820 --> 27:31.540
From a game back in March.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.900
Do you recognise the man he's with?

27:43.900 --> 27:45.420
That's Ben Oakley.

27:48.580 --> 27:50.180
He lives at the Peace Camp.

27:50.180 --> 27:51.620
He was a friend of Jade's.

28:08.780 --> 28:10.140
Can I help you?

28:38.060 --> 28:42.340
Oi. What are you doing?! Have you
seen Ben Oakley? No. Do you know
where he is?

28:42.340 --> 28:44.500
That's private property!
You can't just smash it in!

28:44.500 --> 28:48.260
We have a warrant.
Who were you just messaging?

28:48.260 --> 28:50.740
If you know where
he is, it's vital that you tell us.

29:24.340 --> 29:26.940
Check all traffic on the loch-side
road, north and south.

29:26.940 --> 29:29.900
I want a full search on all vans
and check car boots,

29:29.900 --> 29:33.020
and follow up with
any of Oakley's known contacts.

29:33.020 --> 29:34.820
We've got something.
Right.

29:34.820 --> 29:36.260
I'll call you back.

29:36.260 --> 29:38.140
Hidden in the fixtures.

29:38.140 --> 29:42.500
Cat! Do you recognise this laptop?

29:44.700 --> 29:46.460
Yeah, it's Jade's.

29:46.460 --> 29:48.420
Any idea why it would be in
Ben's caravan?

29:48.420 --> 29:50.020
That doesn't mean anything.

29:50.020 --> 29:51.820
I used to borrow it off her as well.

29:51.820 --> 29:53.500
So you know the log-in details.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.300
I need to look at that in connection
with Jade's murder.

30:08.420 --> 30:10.820
Two Russian frigates
moving into the patrol area.

30:10.820 --> 30:12.140
Here and here.

30:12.140 --> 30:15.580
And these two are Russian
research ships.

30:15.580 --> 30:17.660
Famous "research vessels".

30:17.660 --> 30:20.620
The Americans have picked up two
Russian submarines,

30:20.620 --> 30:23.780
also moving into the patrol
area from the south.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.940
What do you think?

30:28.940 --> 30:31.060
I'm wondering
if they know where Vigil is.

30:38.700 --> 30:39.860
Thanks for that.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.740
Don't mention it.

30:43.740 --> 30:45.940
So what'll happen to you?

30:45.940 --> 30:47.500
I'm not sure yet.

30:49.860 --> 30:52.460
Might end up seeing
more of the family.

30:53.500 --> 30:54.780
Not before time.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.580
Once I've taken stuff in,
can I bring it back out?

31:00.580 --> 31:02.820
Only things that can be sealed
and then washed down.

31:02.820 --> 31:03.980
Right.

31:05.340 --> 31:07.780
Lt Hadlow will be ready for you in
about five minutes.

31:07.780 --> 31:09.180
You need to get into the suits now.

31:09.180 --> 31:11.140
I then need to tape the cabin closed
when you're out.

31:11.140 --> 31:12.380
I just...

31:12.380 --> 31:13.700
I need a minute.

31:17.660 --> 31:19.140
Amy, there's not much time.

31:19.140 --> 31:20.460
Yeah.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.420
Come here.

31:38.420 --> 31:40.220
Is that good?
So good.

31:41.260 --> 31:43.540
Can you come to my choir
concert next week?

31:43.540 --> 31:47.140
Yeah, sure.

31:47.140 --> 31:49.460
Oh, oh.
I've got to get you back.

31:49.460 --> 31:50.820
But you said we'd go to...

31:50.820 --> 31:52.260
I know, I know, we will next time.

31:52.260 --> 31:54.460
But we've just run out of time.

31:54.460 --> 31:55.940
Promise.

31:55.940 --> 31:57.820
Why doesn't she like you?

31:57.820 --> 32:00.220
What? Who?
Grandma.

32:02.100 --> 32:04.060
We get on fine.
She's...

32:05.340 --> 32:07.420
Just, people are complicated.

32:07.420 --> 32:09.260
And she misses your dad.

32:10.620 --> 32:12.420
But I'm not angry with you.

32:14.500 --> 32:18.580
Well, grief comes out in different
ways in different people.

32:18.580 --> 32:21.460
So...we've just got to give
her some time.

32:23.140 --> 32:24.620
Grandad says you're lonely.

32:31.420 --> 32:35.620
Well, I would like to see you every
day, if that's what you mean.

32:38.460 --> 32:40.900
Hey, you don't
have to worry about me, OK?

32:43.740 --> 32:45.140
Come on.

32:51.020 --> 32:52.420
She likes birds, so...

32:54.260 --> 32:55.700
If anything happens,

32:55.700 --> 32:58.020
could you make sure that
my colleague DS Longacre gets that?

32:58.020 --> 32:59.980
Yes, Ma'am.
Will do.

33:12.860 --> 33:15.460
Rear-Admiral wants me
to get an update from you in person.

33:15.460 --> 33:18.300
We would tell you as soon as
we found anything concrete.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.020
Has something happened?

33:20.020 --> 33:22.660
The Russian Navy have put
multiple vessels

33:22.660 --> 33:24.740
right across the patrol area.

33:24.740 --> 33:26.100
What does that mean?

33:26.100 --> 33:27.980
It looks like they're hunting Vigil.

33:34.980 --> 33:38.500
Ben?
I've got something. It's big.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.340
It's everything we've
worked for, Patrick.

33:40.340 --> 33:41.900
Slow down. Come inside.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.980
They're going to lock me up to stop
me getting it out there.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.980
Look, Ben, seriously, slow down

33:47.980 --> 33:49.700
and tell me what's wrong.

33:51.780 --> 33:55.180
The Russian's have got a
naval spy in Dunloch. What?

33:55.180 --> 33:58.500
Can you imagine the deterrent
surviving that sort of scandal?

33:58.500 --> 34:00.740
They'll never be able to claim
it's safe again.

34:00.740 --> 34:02.380
And you've got proof of this?

34:02.380 --> 34:04.660
Photographic evidence.

34:04.660 --> 34:07.580
But I need to be somewhere
where they can't get to me.

34:09.780 --> 34:13.300
Is there anything
taken in the station?

34:13.300 --> 34:16.020
That's where Jade took her
photo of Ingles meeting someone.

34:16.020 --> 34:17.540
It's not on here.

34:17.540 --> 34:19.540
Right, let me check the system logs.

34:19.540 --> 34:21.460
Porter. What have you found?

34:21.460 --> 34:23.260
OK, so...

34:23.260 --> 34:27.820
System was last booted up about two
hours after she was killed and...

34:27.820 --> 34:30.540
There you go.
Look at that time stamp.

34:30.540 --> 34:32.740
A bluetooth device was connected,

34:32.740 --> 34:36.100
the odds are that's Mr Oakley
moving stuff onto his phone.

34:36.100 --> 34:40.260
If the photo you're after was
deleted, I reckon he's kept a copy.

34:40.260 --> 34:41.580
Ingles had immunity.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.660
He's not going to kill Jade
over a photo of himself.

34:44.660 --> 34:48.180
But he has to have been protecting
the person he was meeting.

34:48.180 --> 34:51.140
Someone who serves on Vigil.
Exactly.

34:51.140 --> 34:53.620
They'd do anything to protect
an asset like that.

34:53.620 --> 34:56.540
We might have something on one
of Oakley's known contacts.

34:56.540 --> 34:57.900
Patrick Cruden.

34:57.900 --> 35:02.220
Oakley made five calls to Cruden's
office in the last two hours.

35:02.220 --> 35:05.940
We need to go. Just let me see
who else we can talk to.

35:05.940 --> 35:07.660
Ben, can I see the photo?

35:11.740 --> 35:15.220
The guy in the ice hockey jacket,
he's a Russian intelligence officer.

35:15.220 --> 35:18.620
Who's that he's with?
He's Royal Navy. That's all I know.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.300
Jesus.

35:20.300 --> 35:21.660
That's huge.

35:21.660 --> 35:23.020
How did you get this?

35:24.300 --> 35:26.260
Ben, this is my reputation
on the line.

35:26.260 --> 35:28.900
You need to be straight with me.

35:28.900 --> 35:31.780
I was approached by the
Russian guy in the photo.

35:31.780 --> 35:34.980
They used to target CND
all the time.

35:34.980 --> 35:37.900
And afterwards I kept tabs on him
just to see what he was up to.

35:37.900 --> 35:40.500
I think they've got a whole network
here now. Have you told the police?

35:40.500 --> 35:42.700
No. They would just bury it with the
Official Secrets Act.

35:42.700 --> 35:45.300
We still have to tell them.
I agree.

35:45.300 --> 35:48.260
But Ben's not wrong.
Look at Port Havers.

35:49.780 --> 35:52.780
We bring the police in as soon as
we publish the photo.

35:52.780 --> 35:55.460
So, shall we release it now, then?
Yes, but not here.

35:56.860 --> 35:59.380
The Russians will kill anyone
they have to,

35:59.380 --> 36:00.940
to stop this getting out there.

36:00.940 --> 36:03.980
I need political asylum
at a foreign consulate.

36:03.980 --> 36:05.660
I can't see any other way.

36:05.660 --> 36:07.460
So can we please just go?!

36:10.300 --> 36:12.300
Boss,
we might have a lead on Oakley.

36:12.300 --> 36:15.020
Patrick Cruden was meant to do
a live radio interview

36:15.020 --> 36:16.740
and never showed up.

36:16.740 --> 36:19.820
His phone is off and his aide's
not picking up either.

36:19.820 --> 36:22.500
His office says that
none of that is usual for him,

36:22.500 --> 36:25.140
so we're on our way
to his house now.

36:25.140 --> 36:28.460
OK, we need live cell-site
information on all their phones -

36:28.460 --> 36:30.620
Oakley, Cruden and his assistant.

36:30.620 --> 36:33.220
We'll send the team
their numbers now.

36:41.620 --> 36:45.900
I'd like to acknowledge Jade
in the video that goes out with it.

36:45.900 --> 36:47.300
She was a friend.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.780
She gave her life to this cause.

36:50.780 --> 36:52.660
Today would have been
a big day for her.

36:52.660 --> 36:54.700
We can do that.

36:54.700 --> 36:57.340
Look, good things are going to
come from this.

36:59.180 --> 37:01.260
She would've been proud of you,
Patrick.

37:03.740 --> 37:06.300
I think she would have been
proud of all of us.

37:13.780 --> 37:15.740
Ben, you're in, my friend.

37:16.980 --> 37:18.460
Oh, thank God for that.

37:18.460 --> 37:19.980
Right. Let's get this video done.

37:19.980 --> 37:22.260
I'll need to edit
the photo in later.

37:22.260 --> 37:25.140
Then I can post it all online once
I get to the consulate.

37:27.300 --> 37:28.900
You're about to see a photo.

37:28.900 --> 37:31.060
In it you'll see two men.

37:31.060 --> 37:33.780
One of them
is a Russian intelligence officer.

37:33.780 --> 37:36.940
The man with him
is a member of the British Navy.

37:38.060 --> 37:39.980
Let that sink in.

37:39.980 --> 37:41.820
We have no viable deterrent

37:41.820 --> 37:45.140
if it can be infiltrated
by a foreign power.

37:45.140 --> 37:47.820
There's no way our government
can claim that these

37:47.820 --> 37:49.420
weapons are safe and secure.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.860
It's time to get the nukes
out of Scotland,

37:53.860 --> 37:57.420
and out of Britain,
before they lead to catastrophe.

38:05.380 --> 38:08.780
When you come back through, you're
going to have to be really careful.

38:08.780 --> 38:10.340
This is a sprinkler pipe.

38:10.340 --> 38:13.060
I'm going to try and bodge
it as much as I can so that

38:13.060 --> 38:15.940
when you come back through, we can
turn it on. Try and wash yourselves

38:15.940 --> 38:19.940
as best as possible. It's not going
to be perfect. When is that going to
be ready? I don't even know if

38:19.940 --> 38:23.500
that's going to work. If it doesn't,
we'll have to put buckets there for
you to use.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.820
This is bleach solution.

38:24.820 --> 38:28.180
Ideally you clean yourselves with
this before you come back in.

38:28.180 --> 38:30.620
Avoid the seams of your suit.
They fall apart.

38:30.620 --> 38:31.820
Right.

38:31.820 --> 38:35.860
Assume the device is booby-trapped,
so kid gloves, yeah.

38:35.860 --> 38:39.780
We'll clear a run for you from here
to the bomb shop where you can flush
it from one of the torpedo tubes.

38:39.780 --> 38:42.100
We'll have someone with hazmat
training there to assist.

38:42.100 --> 38:44.860
Hopefully the sea water will
disperse the nerve agent. DCI Silva,

38:44.860 --> 38:47.540
let the coxswain handle the
technical side as he knows the boat.

38:47.540 --> 38:49.260
I think that's it. All set?

38:49.260 --> 38:51.540
Mm-hm. Yep.
Good luck.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.820
Believe me, you'll be glad of it.

39:03.940 --> 39:05.100
Helmets.
Yep.

39:07.820 --> 39:10.980
The suits have basic radio
so you can talk to each other.

39:10.980 --> 39:13.140
We won't pick you up out here
though,

39:13.140 --> 39:15.140
so bang on the door
when you need to come out.

39:15.140 --> 39:17.220
Do any of the crew know Morse Code?
Yes, I do.

39:17.220 --> 39:18.900
OK, I'm going to find two tones.

39:18.900 --> 39:20.940
High tones for dots, low for dashes.

39:20.940 --> 39:23.420
In case we need to message.
OK. Great.

39:23.420 --> 39:25.420
OK, we need to go now.

39:36.340 --> 39:37.460
For Morse code.

39:38.740 --> 39:40.660
Are you ready?
Yep.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.660
Clear the passageways.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.700
Start ventilating
the fans on fast speed.

40:00.700 --> 40:01.780
Aye, sir.

40:31.340 --> 40:32.900
Oh, shit.

40:35.820 --> 40:37.300
No-one there.

40:37.300 --> 40:39.300
So why is his car still here, then?

40:39.300 --> 40:41.980
Boss.

40:41.980 --> 40:43.820
We're at Cruden's house,
he's not here.

40:43.820 --> 40:46.100
No. I've got a fair idea where
they're headed.

40:46.100 --> 40:48.700
There's nothing from Patrick Cruden
or Ben Oakley,

40:48.700 --> 40:51.020
but it's been nonstop
with Mark Hill.

40:51.020 --> 40:53.540
He's phoned 12 different consulates,
all of them in Edinburgh.

40:53.540 --> 40:54.940
Consulate.

40:54.940 --> 40:58.460
I'd say that Mr Oakley's hoping
to claim asylum. Right.

40:58.460 --> 41:00.580
We need to put people
around the Russian consulate.

41:00.580 --> 41:02.820
That's the one he'll be heading to.

41:44.100 --> 41:46.900
You want to make a start?
I'll go to the hazmat suits.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.260
Sure.

42:13.980 --> 42:15.780
How are you doing, Amy?

42:15.780 --> 42:18.620
Just looking at the body now.
OK.

42:42.140 --> 42:45.380
Let me just shift these
and then I'll get back to you.

42:45.380 --> 42:46.580
OK.

43:05.740 --> 43:07.500
I've dropped off the hazmat suits.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.700
OK, I'm coming back to you now.

43:42.300 --> 43:43.820
We need to speak to you, sir.

43:43.820 --> 43:46.260
We're looking for Ben Oakley.

43:46.260 --> 43:47.620
I can't help you with that.

43:47.620 --> 43:51.300
Did you drop him off
at the Russian consulate?

43:51.300 --> 43:53.860
I'm sorry, I might have to
deal with this.

43:53.860 --> 43:55.260
I won't be a minute.

44:01.780 --> 44:04.060
Ben Oakley is going to be the guy
who got nuclear weapons

44:04.060 --> 44:06.580
out of Scotland
and I am proud to support him.

44:06.580 --> 44:09.460
I believe he has a photo.
Yes, I've seen it.

44:09.460 --> 44:11.540
That's not Oakley's photo.

44:11.540 --> 44:12.740
Jade took it.

44:14.620 --> 44:16.700
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

44:16.700 --> 44:20.260
We found Jade's laptop
hidden in Ben Oakley's caravan.

44:20.260 --> 44:23.620
We have evidence that he stole that
photo from her laptop,

44:23.620 --> 44:26.500
and then we believe that he supplied
it to a Russian intelligence

44:26.500 --> 44:29.060
officer known as Peter Ingles.

44:29.060 --> 44:33.300
Now, that photo is the reason
why Jade was murdered.

44:33.300 --> 44:34.340
No.

44:35.380 --> 44:38.860
See, this is Ben Oakley
sitting with Peter Ingles.

44:38.860 --> 44:41.060
The same man that she took
a photograph of.

44:41.060 --> 44:44.220
Do you have a copy of the photo
Oakley showed you?

44:44.220 --> 44:46.940
Was Ingles with anybody else
in the photo that you saw?

44:48.420 --> 44:52.260
Did you see another man? Yes,
but I only saw it for a few seconds.

44:52.260 --> 44:54.700
We believe that that other man
is right now on Vigil

44:54.700 --> 44:57.580
involved in a plot to sabotage it.

44:57.580 --> 44:59.060
Where is Ben Oakley?

45:00.060 --> 45:02.740
At the Chinese consulate.
Mark's dropping him off there now.

45:02.740 --> 45:04.180
Chinese.

45:04.180 --> 45:06.500
It's not Russia, it's the Chinese.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.980
Move fast, we're on our way.

45:08.980 --> 45:11.700
What he did to Jade was monstrous.

45:11.700 --> 45:13.100
I'm so sorry.

45:40.060 --> 45:41.300
I'll bag that up.

46:24.420 --> 46:26.700
Got a note.
A note?

46:26.700 --> 46:28.460
I'm just trying to make it out.

46:28.460 --> 46:30.740
"Little Cat, Bali not a done deal.

46:32.340 --> 46:34.140
"One last chance.

46:35.300 --> 46:37.620
"Leave it where instructed...

46:39.220 --> 46:40.940
"..or you'll join Burke."

46:43.900 --> 46:46.020
There's someone else on the boat.

46:50.380 --> 46:51.940
They left this, it's orders.

46:53.460 --> 46:56.700
"One last chance."
I think they were threatening her.

46:56.700 --> 46:58.780
I don't think she wanted to be
involved any more.

47:03.300 --> 47:06.620
If there's someone else on the boat,
then why did they need Jackie?

47:13.740 --> 47:16.300
What if they weren't on the boat
in the first place?

47:17.980 --> 47:19.020
As in...

47:20.260 --> 47:23.420
..what if it was Jackie's
job to kill Burke

47:23.420 --> 47:25.700
so they could
fly his replacement out?

47:27.300 --> 47:30.100
Do you mean Doward?
Yeah.

47:30.100 --> 47:33.220
Yeah, Doward wrote this note.
Threatened her.

47:33.220 --> 47:34.700
I think he's done all of this.

47:43.260 --> 47:45.060
What is it?
I feel the heat.

47:48.300 --> 47:51.460
It's just the heat.
Let me check.

47:51.460 --> 47:53.940
Look at me. Look.

47:55.580 --> 47:58.540
Oh, no. Look at me.
We need to get you out.

47:58.540 --> 48:00.420
I didn't see that happening.

48:01.420 --> 48:02.740
OK, let's go.

48:11.020 --> 48:13.220
Hey, hey, hey, Elliot!

48:13.220 --> 48:14.260
OK.

48:16.340 --> 48:18.620
This needs to be flushed
in the torpedo tube.

48:18.620 --> 48:21.420
Yeah, I know.
Go! No. Come on.

48:27.020 --> 48:30.260
Lean on me.

48:30.260 --> 48:32.660
OK, stay with me.

48:32.660 --> 48:34.700
Shit.

48:34.700 --> 48:37.780
Elliot, stay with me. Elliot,
look at me.

48:37.780 --> 48:39.540
Elliot. Look.

48:39.540 --> 48:41.420
We need to keep moving.

48:55.140 --> 48:57.580
They're coming out!
Shit.

48:57.580 --> 49:00.700
Start the sprinklers now!
Clear the passageway!

49:00.700 --> 49:02.220
Stand by to vent.

51:27.860 --> 51:29.620
No, not that.

51:29.620 --> 51:31.300
It's evidence.

51:48.580 --> 51:49.820
He's been exposed.

51:51.300 --> 51:52.980
Oh, shit.

52:04.780 --> 52:06.460
Oh, my God!

52:06.460 --> 52:07.860
Jesus!

52:34.300 --> 52:35.460
No!

52:35.460 --> 52:37.660
Help! Help.
