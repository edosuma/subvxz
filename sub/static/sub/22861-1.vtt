02:54.654 --> 02:58.257
- Where do you want this, Ma?
- Here on the counter.

03:00.460 --> 03:03.450
Vinny, what happened to your face?

03:03.530 --> 03:06.766
It's nothin', you should see the other guy.

03:07.468 --> 03:11.759
Why you do the fighting?
Why you no play the golf that you like?

03:11.839 --> 03:14.095
That's a rich guy's sport, Ma.

03:14.475 --> 03:18.065
Once I turn pro, I'll be able
to play golf all the time.

03:18.145 --> 03:21.214
And buy you and Pop anything you want.

03:22.181 --> 03:26.618
Vinny, I already got everything I want.

03:28.020 --> 03:29.541
I know, I know.

03:29.621 --> 03:34.615
- Make sure you got enough for us next week.
- Sure, sure, no problem, gentlemen.

03:34.695 --> 03:37.898
I sell you all the sugar,
all the yeast you need.

03:47.573 --> 03:49.775
More guys from the Genna mob?

03:51.411 --> 03:56.270
Don't worry about them. They just
need ingredients to make the booze.

03:57.250 --> 04:00.841
So maybe you shouldn't be sellin'
your homemade wine right now.

04:00.921 --> 04:03.610
You don't want them thinkin'
that you're their competition.

04:03.690 --> 04:07.280
Competition? It's no competition.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.383
Nobody make better wine than I do.

04:09.663 --> 04:13.328
- Plus, hey, we need the money.
- Yeah, I know, Pop.

04:13.408 --> 04:17.058
Hey, this crazy prohibition
these politicians make...

04:17.137 --> 04:20.572
...it's an opportunity for everybody.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.564
And why we come to America?

04:23.644 --> 04:25.665
Opportunity.

04:25.745 --> 04:28.013
I know, I know, I know.

04:29.816 --> 04:32.306
All right, I gotta go for a run, okay?

04:32.386 --> 04:34.960
I gotta be in tip-top shape for tomorrow.

04:51.320 --> 04:53.243
Come on, O'Malley!

04:53.323 --> 04:55.608
My grandma hits harder than that.

04:58.878 --> 05:00.600
He's done.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.304
Jesus, I thought we were supposed
to be sparring in here.

05:03.384 --> 05:06.006
Sorry, Sergeant, I got carried away.

05:06.086 --> 05:08.687
Yeah, take it easy, Jack!
O'Malley's jaw swells up...

05:08.767 --> 05:10.778
...he won't be able to eat
any donuts for a week.

05:10.858 --> 05:13.046
Yeah, fuck you, Landa.

05:13.126 --> 05:15.128
He's got a good left hand.

05:21.567 --> 05:24.124
Lookin' good, Jack. Lookin' real good.

05:24.204 --> 05:25.659
Thank you.

05:25.739 --> 05:29.623
- You ready for tomorrow night?
- Are you kiddin', that's my big debut.

05:30.143 --> 05:32.032
Just wish it was a sanctioned event.

05:32.112 --> 05:34.535
Can't have 'em in Chicago
anymore like they do back east.

05:34.615 --> 05:36.536
Nah, that's okay.

05:36.616 --> 05:39.440
A charity event for veterans,
what could be better?

05:40.220 --> 05:42.288
You're gonna be there, right?

05:44.024 --> 05:46.197
- Wouldn't miss it.
- Swell.

05:46.277 --> 05:49.717
Look, I gotta get in the shower.
I gotta go to the store and see my pop.

05:50.597 --> 05:53.265
- Sorry again, Sergeant.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:53.345 --> 05:55.388
He's hits like a mule
considering how young he is.

05:55.468 --> 05:57.728
Is that your excuse, Bob?

05:58.038 --> 06:01.507
- Even your hookers don't go down that fast.
- Yeah, fuck you.

06:02.775 --> 06:06.397
<i>And in the other corner,
fighting for the Irish...</i>

06:06.477 --> 06:11.009
<i>...making his big debut,
Battling Jack McGurn!</i>

06:15.087 --> 06:17.711
- Here's our boy.
- Jackie!

06:17.991 --> 06:19.852
Come on, Jack!

06:22.828 --> 06:25.918
Well, well, look who's here. Capone.

06:26.538 --> 06:29.990
- A little far from the south side, isn't he?
- Fight fans go where the fights are, huh?

06:30.070 --> 06:32.592
Hey, you don't think
he's here to gamble, do you?

06:32.672 --> 06:34.628
A fine upstanding citizen like him?

06:34.708 --> 06:37.965
No, he's taking another poor
orphan boy to his first sporting event.

06:38.045 --> 06:40.079
I feel bad I misjudged him.

07:32.998 --> 07:34.566
Frankie!

07:36.803 --> 07:38.651
<i>Grazie, mama.</i>

07:41.073 --> 07:42.930
The bread's a little tough.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.207
Papa told me you knocked the guy's block off.

07:46.747 --> 07:50.815
Yep. It even bounced around
the canvas a few times.

07:50.917 --> 07:53.813
- Vinny!
- What, I'm only kidding!

07:53.893 --> 07:55.955
It's a figure of speech.

07:57.357 --> 08:01.705
Hey, why don't you tell your mama
what happened next?

08:01.785 --> 08:02.816
What?

08:02.896 --> 08:05.697
Well, there were some promoters
at the fight tonight.

08:06.099 --> 08:09.263
They said after a few more tune-ups,
they're gonna put me on the pro fight card...

08:09.343 --> 08:11.144
...out in Aurora.

08:12.105 --> 08:13.965
That's my boy!

08:17.420 --> 08:20.928
Here's to the next welterweight
champion of the world!

08:21.948 --> 08:23.827
- Salud!
- Salud.

08:23.907 --> 08:25.985
- Salud.
- Salud.

08:36.962 --> 08:38.592
No, no.

08:44.870 --> 08:46.860
You think we're stupid?
We know what you're doin'.

08:46.940 --> 08:49.429
- What?
- Nobody sells liquor on the West Side...

08:49.509 --> 08:51.231
...except the Genna family!

08:51.311 --> 08:53.747
This is the only warning you're gonna get.

09:01.690 --> 09:03.509
What time you got?

09:04.456 --> 09:07.948
It's a little before ten.
You want me to take over?

09:08.028 --> 09:10.250
Nah, I don't mind driving.

09:10.330 --> 09:13.887
You get used to these Canadian
runs after a while.

09:13.967 --> 09:17.690
I gotta say, Torrio's fuckin' right,
it's worth the drive.

09:17.770 --> 09:20.901
Especially compared to that
bathtub shit people drink.

09:28.981 --> 09:30.815
What's this?

09:39.391 --> 09:41.047
You havin' trouble?

09:41.127 --> 09:42.656
No...

09:43.279 --> 09:44.685
...you are.

09:44.765 --> 09:48.789
Buddy, just take a minute.
You don't know whose truck this is.

09:48.869 --> 09:51.057
Sure I do, it's mine.

09:51.137 --> 09:54.527
Look, this is the south side.
This is Johnny Torrio's territory.

09:54.807 --> 09:56.829
You gotta be crazy!

09:56.909 --> 09:59.833
Well, I've heard that before.

09:59.913 --> 10:04.348
Sometimes people even call me 'Bugs'.

10:04.683 --> 10:07.707
Fuck. It's Bugs Moran.

10:07.787 --> 10:11.076
- You're with the O'Banion mob.
- That's right.

10:11.156 --> 10:14.314
Only Mr. O'Banion
doesn't just run the north side.

10:14.394 --> 10:18.285
Now he runs the south side,
west side, all sides.

10:18.365 --> 10:21.000
Make sure your tell Torrio that. Get out.

10:28.173 --> 10:32.432
Tell him we said thanks.
We appreciate you doin' all the drivin'.

10:32.512 --> 10:34.144
And thanks for the new truck.

10:42.087 --> 10:43.955
Tough break, kid.

10:44.657 --> 10:46.847
I don't suppose the purse was too big either.

10:46.927 --> 10:49.983
The big money goes to the guys
at the top of the card.

10:50.563 --> 10:53.565
- Name's Al, by the way.
- Jack.

10:55.767 --> 10:57.652
No, you're not.

11:00.359 --> 11:04.030
Been asking around about you.
Your name's Vinny Demory.

11:04.110 --> 11:06.312
What's with the name change?

11:09.415 --> 11:11.571
If you've been around the fight game...

11:11.651 --> 11:15.522
...you know for some reason
people don't go for Italian boxers.

11:16.089 --> 11:17.911
But the Irish?

11:17.991 --> 11:19.546
They love 'em.

11:19.626 --> 11:22.973
So I told the police at the gym
that my name was Jack McGurn...

11:23.053 --> 11:25.785
...and they said, "welcome, kid, come on in."

11:25.865 --> 11:28.554
Smart. Stupid micks.

11:29.434 --> 11:32.872
So, how'd you like to make
some real money, Jack?

11:34.974 --> 11:36.930
How do you mean?

11:37.010 --> 11:40.825
- My boss, Mr. Torrio.
- Johnny Torrio?

11:41.413 --> 11:45.546
Mr. Torrio is always lookin' for smart guys
who know how to climb up the ladder.

11:45.786 --> 11:48.909
Yeah, well, my pop's got enough
trouble with the Gennas as it is.

11:48.989 --> 11:52.825
The Gennas? They're bums.
They'll get theirs some day.

11:55.294 --> 11:57.661
I just don't want to get involved
with guns or nothin'.

11:57.741 --> 12:01.243
Who said anything about guns?
With those mitts of yours?

12:02.002 --> 12:05.428
We're just lookin' for a little bit
of protection for our drivers.

12:07.139 --> 12:09.423
You want to help out your family, don't you?

12:11.543 --> 12:13.933
Yeah, of course.

12:14.013 --> 12:15.902
So what do you say?

12:15.982 --> 12:19.365
Look, if you don't like it, no hard feelings.

12:31.296 --> 12:36.089
I tell ya, this prohibition, it's the best
thing that ever happened to me.

12:36.169 --> 12:37.500
Yeah?

12:38.722 --> 12:42.138
That's funny, my pop says the same thing.

12:46.112 --> 12:47.913
What the hell?

13:07.933 --> 13:10.150
Step out of the truck please.

13:13.939 --> 13:16.229
- What's in the truck?
- Groceries.

13:16.309 --> 13:19.710
Oh, yeah? The liquid kind? Let's take a look.

13:19.790 --> 13:22.369
Come on, guys. Is that really necessary?

13:22.449 --> 13:26.318
Shut your mouth, alright? We're going
to have to confiscate this truck.

13:43.436 --> 13:47.044
So, what's the tally?

13:47.506 --> 13:50.430
Just under a hundred
thousand dollars this month.

13:50.510 --> 13:53.666
- That's it?
- No, that can't be right.

13:53.746 --> 13:56.669
What about all the booze
we've been swipin' from Capone?

13:56.749 --> 13:59.706
We're saving a bundle not having
to buy own own trucks!

13:59.786 --> 14:02.042
It's really none of my business,
Mr. O'Banion...

14:02.122 --> 14:05.011
...but Torrio and Capone are still
bringing in more money than you are...

14:05.091 --> 14:07.881
...and it's largely due to their brothels.
If you're asking me.

14:07.961 --> 14:09.816
Well, I didn't!

14:10.196 --> 14:13.019
But if you ask me, I'll tell you this.

14:13.099 --> 14:15.183
Booze is one thing...

14:15.263 --> 14:18.958
...but the holy mother would never
forgive me for startin' cathouses up here.

14:19.038 --> 14:23.964
That may be okay for those spaghetti
bendin' pimps, but not for me!

14:24.044 --> 14:27.501
As a matter of fact, I'll bet that
some of the boys on our payroll...

14:27.581 --> 14:30.850
...chasin' wops out of
this neighborhood right now!

14:32.384 --> 14:35.968
These books are being cooked,
you will be, too.

14:39.444 --> 14:41.025
Cheers.

14:42.744 --> 14:45.998
See, what did I yell ya?
I knew I had it handled.

14:47.566 --> 14:50.635
So, nice work, young man.

14:51.170 --> 14:53.193
Thank you, Mr. Torrio.

14:53.573 --> 14:56.362
Want a taste of Canada's finest?

14:56.442 --> 14:58.122
No, thanks.

14:58.202 --> 15:00.107
I'm still in training for my fights.

15:00.947 --> 15:03.237
An Italian that doesn't drink.

15:04.140 --> 15:05.645
Okay.

15:09.554 --> 15:13.913
So what do you like?
You like gambling, like women, what?

15:13.993 --> 15:16.849
I never had no money for gambling...

15:16.929 --> 15:19.419
...or women, for that matter.

15:19.499 --> 15:22.722
We got a ton of whorehouses
on the south side, my treat.

15:22.802 --> 15:25.658
Yeah, but you have to watch out because
you're not gonna find one whore...

15:25.738 --> 15:29.266
...in any of those places that this mamaluc'
hasn't already fucked and tainted.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.565
Hey, you gotta test 'em out,
make sure they know what they're doin'.

15:32.645 --> 15:34.767
Nah, that's okay.

15:34.847 --> 15:36.882
What do you like?

15:38.350 --> 15:42.041
You like nightclubs? You like music?

15:42.121 --> 15:44.684
- You mean like jazz?
- Sure.

15:44.764 --> 15:48.517
- Yeah, I love jazz.
- Alright, alright. Al...

15:48.597 --> 15:52.852
...you have take this young man
to The Four Deuces, it's all my treat.

15:52.932 --> 15:54.887
Okay, Torrio.

15:54.967 --> 15:56.529
Where?

16:23.928 --> 16:27.799
This, this is Torrio's place, enjoy yourself.

16:28.767 --> 16:33.059
Besides, I gotta see some professional
ladies who could use my company.

16:33.139 --> 16:35.006
Have fun, kid.

16:47.018 --> 16:49.487
- For you, sir?
- Club soda.

16:59.631 --> 17:01.980
- Hey, doll, let me buy you a drink.
- Get your paws off.

17:02.060 --> 17:04.321
- It's just a drink.
- I said leave me alone!

17:04.402 --> 17:06.948
I think the lady said
that she's not interested.

17:08.874 --> 17:10.641
Fuck you.

17:14.244 --> 17:16.117
Come on.

17:18.148 --> 17:19.556
My hero.

17:19.636 --> 17:22.710
Nah, you probably could've
handled him yourself.

17:24.089 --> 17:26.138
- Lulu.
- Jack.

17:26.219 --> 17:29.515
Okay, it's Louise,
but I'm trying to be a model.

17:29.595 --> 17:32.620
I think Lulu sounds sexier,
what do you think?

17:33.750 --> 17:35.788
Can I buy you a drink, Lulu?

17:35.868 --> 17:38.235
No thanks, I brought my own.

17:42.808 --> 17:44.479
Well.

17:44.559 --> 17:46.244
You dance?

18:09.284 --> 18:11.770
Thank you, thank you.

18:22.481 --> 18:25.371
Well, thanks for the dance, handsome.

18:25.451 --> 18:28.474
- I gotta go.
- Oh, wait, wait.

18:28.554 --> 18:30.355
When can I see you again?

18:32.256 --> 18:33.738
Honey...

18:34.269 --> 18:37.317
...based on this ten dollar suit,
I don't think you can afford me.

18:37.397 --> 18:40.799
But good luck with the boxing, slugger.

18:52.629 --> 18:55.589
- Sun's gonna be up in a bit, huh?
- Yeah.

18:55.669 --> 18:59.470
- I ain't never pulled an all-nighter before.
- Really? Welcome to the club.

19:00.553 --> 19:04.344
You know, if you come work for us full time,
you can come to the club whenever you want.

19:04.424 --> 19:06.712
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:06.792 --> 19:09.515
I don't know, I just can't.

19:09.595 --> 19:11.784
Really? Okay, okay.

19:11.864 --> 19:16.088
Look, if you ever change your mind,
there's a whole lotta money to be made...

19:16.168 --> 19:18.204
...especially for that family of yours.

19:20.372 --> 19:22.173
Thanks, Al.

19:23.708 --> 19:25.543
Let's go, Al.

19:45.113 --> 19:48.205
You thought you could
muscle in on our territory?

19:49.185 --> 19:50.743
Angelo?

19:51.920 --> 19:55.283
Angelo! Angelo!

20:08.169 --> 20:10.997
Ma? Ma!

20:12.307 --> 20:13.866
Vinny!

20:15.176 --> 20:17.099
What... what happened?

20:17.179 --> 20:19.402
Sorry, kid, somebody popped your old man.

20:19.482 --> 20:21.040
What?

20:24.386 --> 20:28.028
Your mother said she never seen them before.

20:28.858 --> 20:31.180
She probably can't identify them.

20:31.260 --> 20:35.351
Listen, I'm going to be honest with you guys.
There's probably nothing we can do here.

20:35.431 --> 20:38.988
What are you talking about?
It was the Genna family, I know it was.

20:39.068 --> 20:41.324
Hey, hey, hey, look, kid.

20:41.404 --> 20:45.261
The Gennas know very important people
on this side of town and you know that.

20:45.341 --> 20:49.932
Yeah, just like all the cops
they bought off to look the other way.

20:50.012 --> 20:51.871
Shut your mouth!

21:19.808 --> 21:22.330
Looky, looky, looky what the cat dragged in.

21:22.978 --> 21:25.636
Aren't you boys a little far
from your precinct?

21:27.316 --> 21:30.340
I mean, we're not here
to help you find the killers.

21:31.150 --> 21:33.657
Because we know you're gonna
have a drink with them tonight.

21:37.792 --> 21:39.782
Don't you two got something better to do?

21:39.862 --> 21:43.052
Like, maybe pick up some more bag money?

21:43.132 --> 21:45.006
Is that what you call it?

21:56.081 --> 21:58.522
We heard about it on the police radio.

21:59.789 --> 22:02.032
They steal anything, money?

22:03.084 --> 22:04.941
You recognize 'em?

22:05.021 --> 22:07.009
The car, anything?

22:07.089 --> 22:08.647
No.

22:09.524 --> 22:11.383
Alright.

22:11.926 --> 22:16.125
It's those two clowns precinct, so on
this, our hands are kind of tied but...

22:16.205 --> 22:18.124
I understand.

22:19.501 --> 22:22.466
You don't hesitate
to give us a call, alright, kid?

22:24.206 --> 22:25.764
Ma'am.

22:32.013 --> 22:38.106
The police, they're going to find
the men who do this, yes?

22:38.186 --> 22:42.240
No, they're not gonna do nothin'.

23:11.052 --> 23:13.486
Hey, boss, someone to see you.

23:16.524 --> 23:18.937
Hey, Jack, sit down.

23:33.408 --> 23:35.364
Does that offer still stand?

23:35.444 --> 23:39.464
Yes, I gotta warn you,
things are starting to heat up.

23:45.987 --> 23:49.612
Mike Merlo had done a good job
at the head of the Sicilian Union...

23:50.392 --> 23:52.596
...keepin' peace between the families.

23:54.422 --> 23:56.286
The problem is...

23:57.366 --> 23:59.967
...Mike died a couple days ago from cancer.

24:01.986 --> 24:06.180
Right afterwards, the micks
started shootin' up our drivers.

24:07.292 --> 24:10.917
I'll do whatever you want on one condition.

24:12.247 --> 24:15.458
You give me the names
of the men who killed my father.

24:37.255 --> 24:39.015
Welcome, Jack.

25:15.576 --> 25:19.380
We can't very well
keep going the way we have.

25:19.715 --> 25:23.743
The killings, the violence,
it's not good for business.

25:25.754 --> 25:27.980
Violence is my business.

25:29.858 --> 25:34.286
And I fought for every inch
I own in this city.

25:35.663 --> 25:39.925
I'm no stranger to violence either, Dion.

25:46.941 --> 25:49.390
I wanted to meet with you, Johnny...

25:52.183 --> 25:54.072
...because I agree.

25:55.616 --> 25:59.395
All these killings are getting out of hand.

25:59.475 --> 26:04.327
Why don't we staunch the flow
of blood running through our streets.

26:04.920 --> 26:07.824
There's plenty of customers for both of us.

26:09.364 --> 26:11.223
I'll tell you what.

26:11.833 --> 26:15.461
This here brewery is more than I need.

26:16.104 --> 26:20.090
We've got plenty of others.
Why don't you take it off my hands.

26:22.510 --> 26:24.036
Good.

26:45.934 --> 26:47.563
Well.

26:51.706 --> 26:54.600
- So, no more violence?
- Salud.

27:00.782 --> 27:03.005
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

27:03.085 --> 27:05.141
You're not training anymore?

27:05.721 --> 27:07.454
I got a new job.

27:07.534 --> 27:09.381
And a new suit.

27:10.892 --> 27:13.300
So how's the modeling business?

27:14.229 --> 27:17.152
I went out to California for a few weeks.

27:17.232 --> 27:19.955
- It didn't work out.
- No?

27:20.035 --> 27:21.256
No.

27:21.636 --> 27:25.095
They don't know what they're doin'
if they let you get away.

27:26.125 --> 27:28.066
Oh, yeah?

27:47.428 --> 27:51.353
The first thing I want to do is get
rid of all O'Banion's piss water.

27:51.433 --> 27:54.531
I'm gonna bring in the best hops,
the best malt...

27:54.611 --> 27:59.344
...all the ingredients we need to make
the best goddamn beer in Chicago.

27:59.424 --> 28:01.134
Then once we get up and running here...

28:01.214 --> 28:05.100
...we should be making over
a million dollars a year, easy.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.989
Alright, boys, let's take her down.

28:08.984 --> 28:10.843
Get over there!

28:12.186 --> 28:15.721
- What the hell is this?
- Alright, nobody move, FBI, this is a bust!

28:15.801 --> 28:19.284
- Who the hell are you, you got a warrant?
- Yes.

28:21.796 --> 28:25.955
I tell you, you're wasting your time!
This is just a waste of your time.

28:26.035 --> 28:28.290
O'Banion set me up, alright?

28:28.870 --> 28:31.760
Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.362
See?

28:33.642 --> 28:38.136
I'm a man of my word, no more violence.

28:39.180 --> 28:43.916
Why waste bullets on ignorant greaseballs
when you can just have them arrested?

28:44.686 --> 28:46.776
Like taking candy from a baby.

28:47.356 --> 28:49.381
Or liquor from a wop.

28:51.527 --> 28:54.583
And, you know, now with Torrio gone...

28:54.663 --> 28:58.522
...I'm going to make sure the next head
of the Sicilian Union is one of our own.

28:59.902 --> 29:03.759
You know, there's another good
thing about Mike Merlo dying.

29:03.839 --> 29:06.464
Yeah, what's that?

29:06.841 --> 29:10.900
Well, what does everyone do
when there's a funeral?

29:10.980 --> 29:12.785
They buy flowers.

29:44.045 --> 29:47.473
Don't worry, I wouldn't turn you in.

29:50.218 --> 29:53.042
I been in enough trouble
with the law as it is.

29:53.122 --> 29:55.814
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

29:56.390 --> 29:59.045
I accidentally killed a guy once.

30:00.414 --> 30:01.949
I got loaded...

30:02.029 --> 30:05.220
...took out my old man's car,
went for a joy ride.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.423
I hit another guy's car.

30:08.229 --> 30:10.092
Why aren't you in jail?

30:10.172 --> 30:14.150
My daddy's got money,
knew the right judge to give it to.

30:14.610 --> 30:16.131
Jeez.

30:17.011 --> 30:20.236
I guess I'll be doin'
the driving from now on.

30:20.716 --> 30:22.234
Oh, yeah?

30:24.885 --> 30:26.910
Are you taking me places?

30:28.523 --> 30:30.749
Anywhere you want to go.

30:40.401 --> 30:43.495
Fuckin' rat! That Irish fuckin' rat!

30:44.138 --> 30:47.829
What, fuckin' sells Torrio his brewery
and then runs and tells the feds?

30:47.909 --> 30:51.520
And then tries to put Angelo Genna
at the head of the Sicilian family?

30:51.980 --> 30:55.681
He's a fuckin' dead man!
Do you fuckin' hear me!

30:55.761 --> 31:00.312
- Don't you think we should wait till Torrio...
- What are you interrupting me for?

31:04.625 --> 31:07.917
There's a lot of people buying flowers
for Mike Merlo's funeral.

31:08.397 --> 31:11.837
You two know what to do.
Jack, you're drivin'.

31:12.366 --> 31:13.892
Go!

31:24.578 --> 31:26.427
Keep the motor runnin'.

31:36.891 --> 31:38.280
Hello, Dion.

31:39.816 --> 31:42.555
You're here for Mike's funeral, I take it.

31:43.798 --> 31:45.753
There you are.

31:45.833 --> 31:48.223
Among other things, you dirty mick.

31:48.303 --> 31:49.827
No!

31:58.946 --> 32:00.559
Alright, come on, Jackie,
let's move, let's move.

32:00.639 --> 32:02.489
Go, go, go!

32:05.987 --> 32:09.244
Johnny Torrio, I am sentencing you...

32:09.324 --> 32:12.281
...to nine months in the Lake County jail.

32:12.361 --> 32:14.840
Request that my client have 48 hours
to put his affairs in order?

32:14.920 --> 32:16.498
Granted.

32:16.578 --> 32:18.943
So you're saying you
have no idea who did this?

32:23.170 --> 32:25.527
Boys, we're trying to help you out here.
We're trying to give you a break...

32:25.607 --> 32:27.701
...we know this wasn't a robbery.

32:30.644 --> 32:33.068
You know how this city got its name?

32:33.538 --> 32:34.856
The Indians.

32:34.936 --> 32:36.754
When they came here...

32:37.380 --> 32:40.983
...there was nothin', except for swamp...

32:41.063 --> 32:42.814
...cabbage weeds.

32:43.658 --> 32:46.954
They called it 'Chi-ca-gou'...

32:47.034 --> 32:50.864
...which means 'bad smell'.

32:52.566 --> 32:56.572
See, no matter how hard
you boys try to clean it up...

32:57.688 --> 32:59.575
...this place...

32:59.909 --> 33:02.410
...will always be rotten.

33:03.711 --> 33:05.768
Well, we're gonna keep tryin'.

33:06.548 --> 33:11.565
So... if you can think of anything,
you just give us a call, here's our card.

33:12.354 --> 33:14.213
Alright, there you go.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.568
Those motherfuckers.

33:38.779 --> 33:42.340
Those greasy wop motherfuckers!

33:44.084 --> 33:46.945
Right here in his own shop!

33:48.255 --> 33:51.917
They kill a man while he's selling flowers...

33:52.543 --> 33:54.594
...for Mike Merlo's funeral.

33:55.613 --> 33:57.655
One of their kind!

34:03.972 --> 34:05.831
They want a war?

34:07.708 --> 34:11.699
- Well, they just got one!
- If you elect me as your mayor...

34:11.780 --> 34:14.344
...I vow that I will put an end...

34:14.424 --> 34:17.706
...to these criminal gangs that have
been taking over our fair city.

34:17.786 --> 34:21.011
- Great, this is exactly what we need.
- I will shut down...

34:21.127 --> 34:24.263
...these speakeasys
and gambling parlors and brothels.

34:24.342 --> 34:27.199
- This guy's a schmuck.
- And I will put an end...

34:34.835 --> 34:37.759
- I hate this neighborhood, John.
- I know.

34:37.839 --> 34:41.333
- You promised we would move.
- We will, we will.

34:42.543 --> 34:44.498
I want a bigger house when we do.

34:44.579 --> 34:47.668
Look, it's only nine months, alright?

34:47.748 --> 34:50.005
I'll be back before you know it.

34:50.435 --> 34:53.871
- I want to go back to the old country.
- We'll talk about that later.

35:08.436 --> 35:09.722
So long, Johnny.

35:10.506 --> 35:12.043
Boss!

35:12.641 --> 35:14.466
Boss, we gotta go!

35:20.298 --> 35:23.972
Papers, papers! Get all your papers!

35:24.052 --> 35:27.513
Papers! Get your papers!

35:31.559 --> 35:34.586
I don't how, but he survived.

35:35.463 --> 35:37.319
He's resting in his bed.

35:37.599 --> 35:40.859
- I wanna talk to him.
- All right.

35:53.181 --> 35:54.739
Johnny.

36:00.153 --> 36:01.709
I...

36:04.992 --> 36:09.823
I guess I'm not as quick
on my feet as I used to be, huh?

36:16.036 --> 36:18.096
I got careless.

36:19.256 --> 36:20.898
No, no, you didn't.

36:20.978 --> 36:24.033
Don't worry about it,
doctor says you're gonna be fine.

36:25.113 --> 36:27.374
In a couple of weeks when you get out...

36:27.882 --> 36:30.572
...I'm gonna go track those Irish fucks down.

36:30.652 --> 36:32.207
No.

36:32.287 --> 36:33.845
No.

36:38.125 --> 36:40.751
Al, come here.

36:42.029 --> 36:43.888
Come here.

37:15.362 --> 37:17.505
What did he whisper to you?

37:19.967 --> 37:22.825
He just made me the boss
of the whole south side.

37:24.305 --> 37:25.847
So...

37:26.827 --> 37:29.081
...it looks like I'm gonna
need a first lieutenant.

37:30.143 --> 37:31.970
How about it, Jackie?

37:33.313 --> 37:35.007
Anything you need, Al.

37:57.905 --> 38:01.018
<i>Chicago's gangland
violence continues to soar...</i>

38:04.394 --> 38:08.457
Since the first of this year
there's been 27 gangland killings...

38:08.837 --> 38:10.505
...and not one conviction.

38:10.585 --> 38:13.074
Any witness to come forward
would be number 28, that's why.

38:13.154 --> 38:16.911
Now this bloody rivalry has gotten
to the point where someone's going to talk.

38:16.991 --> 38:18.780
Sooner or later, someone will talk.

38:18.860 --> 38:21.009
You wanna stop the killings,
you gotta end prohibition.

38:21.089 --> 38:24.331
That's up to congress, isn't it?
But in the meantime...

38:24.411 --> 38:27.429
...we'll enforce the laws
that are on the books.

38:27.869 --> 38:30.095
Okay, boys, get to it.

38:44.818 --> 38:48.280
I bet you mugs were wondering
why I brought you down here.

38:54.361 --> 38:56.368
Who wants to take it for a roll?

39:00.067 --> 39:01.723
The Pony Inn.

39:01.803 --> 39:04.430
Bugs Moran's good pals, the O'Donnels.

39:50.484 --> 39:53.511
Get 'em up, everybody hands up! Hands up!

39:56.990 --> 39:58.650
Get your hands up!

39:59.060 --> 40:01.669
Don't even move a fuckin' muscle!

40:07.534 --> 40:10.361
Come on! Jack, come on!

40:37.064 --> 40:38.397
It's Capone's work.

40:38.477 --> 40:42.050
Christ, my boys were entertaining
the state's attorney tonight...

40:42.130 --> 40:43.931
...he's dead.

40:45.105 --> 40:46.853
The feds'll be on us, now.

40:47.041 --> 40:50.448
I don't imagine Capone's gang's gonna stop.

40:50.528 --> 40:52.901
And they'll be comin' for your clubs next.

40:52.981 --> 40:54.806
Oh, hell no.

40:56.083 --> 40:58.157
I'm not gonna let that happen.

41:04.224 --> 41:07.022
If Capone wants to play with the big toys...

41:08.463 --> 41:10.722
...we'll just have to join in on the fun.

41:36.590 --> 41:39.677
You better come grab some
of this before I finish it all.

41:41.649 --> 41:43.283
Daddy?

41:43.363 --> 41:45.057
I said come and join me.

42:08.756 --> 42:10.515
What's wrong?

42:11.658 --> 42:13.180
Nothin'.

42:13.660 --> 42:16.489
You haven't been yourself since last night.

42:20.768 --> 42:24.979
Before I used to get in the ring I used
to say, "I'm gonna murder that bum."

42:26.473 --> 42:29.564
I didn't really meant it.
It was just a sayin', you know?

42:29.644 --> 42:30.869
Sure.

42:30.949 --> 42:34.160
And then you, actually,
and you go and you do it.

42:36.216 --> 42:38.241
Hey, hey...

42:39.229 --> 42:41.479
...these guys are comin' after you.

42:41.789 --> 42:45.024
You gotta defend yourself,
there's nothin' wrong with that.

42:48.262 --> 42:50.686
I bet I know what would make you feel better.

42:51.966 --> 42:53.629
Yeah, well...

42:54.140 --> 42:56.436
...I gotta get to the meeting with Al.

42:58.005 --> 43:00.464
Well, then...

43:01.041 --> 43:05.166
...you can do something
to make me feel better.

43:05.246 --> 43:07.071
Oh, yeah?

43:08.615 --> 43:10.570
What's that?

43:10.650 --> 43:13.691
Get him to make me a dancer
at The Four Deuces.

43:14.689 --> 43:18.746
- A dancer?
- Yeah, you know how good I dance.

43:20.227 --> 43:22.484
I don't want you bein' no dancer.

43:23.064 --> 43:24.622
No?

43:25.966 --> 43:28.423
I thought you liked the way I dance.

43:29.203 --> 43:32.463
Yeah, I like the way you dance.

43:32.940 --> 43:35.530
I don't want you dancin'
for no other guys, though.

43:35.610 --> 43:37.168
No?

43:39.346 --> 43:41.803
Okay, I need to get to the meeting.

43:41.883 --> 43:43.943
I think you're gonna be late.

43:45.769 --> 43:48.143
Are you gonna make me a dancer?

43:48.223 --> 43:51.946
I swear to God, that son of a bitch,
he cost me 10 dollars, Al!

43:52.026 --> 43:55.050
- I could have cut his freakin' throat!
- Why didn't you?

43:55.930 --> 43:58.586
The guy was fuckin' my sister,
what am I gonna do, huh?

43:58.666 --> 44:02.490
It'd break her heart, I mean.
I fucked her a time or two myself.

44:02.570 --> 44:05.306
Hey, watch it! What the fuck?

44:05.386 --> 44:08.255
- That's my sister you're talking about!
- Yeah, she's a nice piece of ass.

44:08.335 --> 44:11.432
- You better watch your freakin' mouth.
- Jack, nice of you to stop by.

44:11.512 --> 44:13.571
My apologies, Al.

44:15.815 --> 44:19.423
- I was...
- Gettin' a blowjob from your lady?

44:21.789 --> 44:24.021
It's the only excuse I accept.

44:27.511 --> 44:29.985
So after our little outing last night...

44:30.665 --> 44:32.721
...the cops raided our casinos.

44:33.601 --> 44:35.427
I guess we hit a nerve.

44:37.118 --> 44:38.929
Everybody down!

45:11.505 --> 45:13.064
Fuck!

45:29.639 --> 45:31.198
I'm out.

45:32.859 --> 45:34.425
- Did you throw in?
- I threw in...

45:34.505 --> 45:36.448
- ...you're the one that didn't throw in.
- I threw in!

45:36.528 --> 45:40.121
Bones, stop food dropping me. I know
your little routine that you're pulling.

45:40.201 --> 45:42.788
- That's bullshit, bullshit.
- Alright, keep your eyes on your cards.

45:42.871 --> 45:44.726
I got my cards.

45:45.506 --> 45:47.398
What do you got?

45:49.042 --> 45:50.936
Lookin' good, ladies.

45:56.416 --> 45:59.646
Take a walk. I want to talk to Jack.

46:16.353 --> 46:20.316
Listen, I never had a chance
to thank you for the restaurant.

46:22.876 --> 46:24.769
There's no need.

46:25.512 --> 46:28.339
Yeah, yeah, there is.

46:30.584 --> 46:33.647
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be here right now.

46:36.323 --> 46:39.350
So, I wanted to repay the favor.

46:44.998 --> 46:46.721
What's this?

46:46.801 --> 46:48.693
I'm a man of my word.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.227
Sorry it took me so long.

46:54.141 --> 46:56.601
Baldelli, Tropea, Bascone.

46:58.678 --> 47:01.387
It's the three men
that killed your father, Jackie.

47:32.129 --> 47:33.638
Tropea.

47:55.952 --> 47:57.510
Bascone!

47:59.474 --> 48:02.363
Let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

48:02.443 --> 48:04.502
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

48:19.627 --> 48:21.012
You're kiddin'?

48:21.092 --> 48:23.951
No, nickel and dime in each of their hands.

48:24.031 --> 48:26.054
Death by machine gun fire.

48:26.134 --> 48:30.658
So, same M.O., and they
all work for the Gennas?

48:30.738 --> 48:32.286
Yep.

48:34.007 --> 48:35.866
Our lucky day.

48:49.222 --> 48:53.068
I told my client he was under
no obligation to appear before you.

48:54.561 --> 48:58.619
But I heard you had some questions for me,
so I thought it was my civic duty to pop in.

48:58.699 --> 49:01.922
Oh, wasn't that nice of you.
Let me ask you something.

49:02.702 --> 49:05.358
Orazio Tropea...

49:05.438 --> 49:07.694
...Vito Bascone.

49:07.774 --> 49:09.642
Is that right?

49:09.722 --> 49:11.535
Ecola Baldelli.

49:12.212 --> 49:15.103
You know those paisans, by any chance?

49:15.383 --> 49:18.839
Yeah, because they were all
machine gunned down here last week.

49:19.369 --> 49:22.573
- That's tragic.
- So, you're denying any responsibility?

49:22.923 --> 49:24.478
Absolutely.

49:24.858 --> 49:26.914
I didn't shoot those men.

49:26.994 --> 49:30.318
Bugs Moran's right hand man Hymie Weiss...

49:30.398 --> 49:32.153
...he was machine gunned down, too...

49:32.233 --> 49:35.856
...right outside the Holy Name
cathedral, no less.

49:36.036 --> 49:37.628
That's terrible.

49:38.371 --> 49:42.237
But I run a used furniture business.
I don't know about such things.

49:44.844 --> 49:46.367
Okay.

49:46.847 --> 49:50.104
I do from time to time
provide liquid refreshments...

49:50.534 --> 49:53.991
...but you guys should know this.
I see a lot of you in my clubs.

49:54.071 --> 49:58.379
Providing alcoholic beverages is
against the law of the land, Mr. Capone.

49:58.459 --> 50:00.848
Then tell people to stop drinking.

50:00.928 --> 50:03.770
The United States congress
put that law on the books...

50:03.850 --> 50:07.532
...to promote the health
and welfare of the American people.

50:07.612 --> 50:10.791
Come on, you expect people to believe that?

50:10.871 --> 50:14.495
That, what, congress jumped because a bunch
of tee-totaling church ladies told them to?

50:14.575 --> 50:17.164
It was Rockefeller and his oil boys!

50:17.244 --> 50:19.967
Cars were made to run on gas or alcohol.

50:20.047 --> 50:22.737
Rockefeller wanted to corner the market.

50:22.817 --> 50:26.041
So, he bribed congress
to put a halt in production...

50:26.921 --> 50:30.732
...of alcohol and now he's making billions.

50:31.558 --> 50:34.034
And you're callin' me the criminal?

50:35.912 --> 50:39.110
Look here, you smelly, greasy wop.

50:39.190 --> 50:41.155
I don't care how you justify what you do.

50:41.235 --> 50:44.558
I don't care the scum in this city
that you got on your payroll.

50:44.638 --> 50:48.328
This is my city you're in and there are
dead bodies on my streets...

50:48.408 --> 50:49.901
...that's a problem.

50:51.745 --> 50:54.570
And what are you gonna do
about it, tough guy?

50:56.150 --> 50:59.446
Since there are no charges,
I believe our business here is done.

51:02.088 --> 51:04.515
Good work, fellas, keep it up.

51:16.009 --> 51:19.324
If they can't take the truth about
this country then fuck 'em!

51:21.908 --> 51:23.468
Jack.

51:24.544 --> 51:26.070
Guys.

51:27.714 --> 51:30.137
What're you hanging out
with a goon like Capone for, Jack?

51:30.217 --> 51:33.140
You know, it's nothin', some part time work.

51:33.220 --> 51:35.275
Driving trucks, whatever.

51:36.155 --> 51:40.614
- 'Cause that's not what people are saying.
- Yeah, you know what they say about rumors?

51:40.694 --> 51:42.561
You can't trust 'em.

51:44.397 --> 51:46.454
I wasn't done talking, Jack.

51:47.034 --> 51:48.857
So I want you to listen to me.

51:49.337 --> 51:52.693
Capone is low-life scum. You understand that?

51:52.773 --> 51:55.964
You wanna pal around with the guineas and
the wops, one of two things gonna happen.

51:56.044 --> 52:00.097
You're gonna be in prison, or you're
gonna end up like your old man.

52:00.948 --> 52:02.970
You wanna do that to your ma?

52:03.250 --> 52:05.506
That's not what your pop would have wanted.

52:06.086 --> 52:08.570
Come on, tell us what we need to know.

52:09.757 --> 52:11.616
Let us help you, Jack.

52:14.928 --> 52:18.429
Like I said, guys, it's just rumors.

52:27.180 --> 52:30.465
Mr. Capone, what are you doing
coming out of police headquarters today?

52:31.095 --> 52:34.573
What, me and the boys? We were
just talking about interior design.

52:49.563 --> 52:51.388
Goddamn it!

52:55.234 --> 52:58.081
Try spreading your feet
a little further apart.

52:58.480 --> 53:00.324
Trust me.

53:09.215 --> 53:12.857
- Not bad, huh?
- Not bad at all.

53:18.257 --> 53:20.548
Been meaning to speak to you
about something, Jack.

53:20.628 --> 53:23.250
We can't just rely on speakeasies
and whorehouses anymore.

53:23.330 --> 53:26.555
I wanna expand into the unions,
pick up the pension funds.

53:27.655 --> 53:30.224
Also, I want you to stop
by the hotels and smoke shops.

53:30.304 --> 53:32.726
Convince them to install slot machines.

53:32.806 --> 53:34.964
- Like in Atlantic City?
- Exactly.

53:35.044 --> 53:39.392
This way instead of waiting on them to
come to us, we bring the action to them.

53:46.786 --> 53:48.592
You know, Al...

53:49.072 --> 53:51.883
...there's something that
I've been meaning to ask you about.

53:53.893 --> 53:57.770
- What's that, Jackie?
- No offense, but...

53:58.450 --> 54:00.890
...how'd you get the scars on your face?

54:03.653 --> 54:06.095
Years ago when I was a bouncer in Brooklyn.

54:07.207 --> 54:09.450
I saw this broad over by the tables.

54:09.810 --> 54:12.692
So I walked up to her, polite-like...

54:13.546 --> 54:16.202
...and I said to her, "You got a nice ass."

54:17.884 --> 54:21.108
Out of nowhere this guy jumped up
from the bar and took out a knife.

54:21.188 --> 54:22.884
He cut the hell out of me.

54:25.091 --> 54:28.118
- Boyfriend?
- No, brother.

54:29.596 --> 54:31.823
The doctors did what they could.

54:33.432 --> 54:36.424
But you know what?
I think it gives me character.

54:36.504 --> 54:38.362
Yeah, sure.

54:40.540 --> 54:43.197
So what'd you do,
did you go back and whack the guy?

54:43.277 --> 54:45.579
No, I hired him.

54:45.659 --> 54:48.065
You can always use a good knife guy, right?

55:01.528 --> 55:04.385
What? The dumb mick moved.

55:04.465 --> 55:07.281
You didn't have your feet
spread far enough apart.

55:09.802 --> 55:12.141
You wanna go again?

55:12.221 --> 55:14.215
No, I don't need no ball.

55:23.283 --> 55:25.158
You know...

55:25.736 --> 55:27.565
...last couple of years...

55:28.021 --> 55:31.902
...our organization here has been suffering.

55:33.426 --> 55:36.116
And I don't just mean financially.

55:36.196 --> 55:39.288
Yeah, no kiddin'.

55:40.399 --> 55:42.233
I can't tell you...

55:42.799 --> 55:45.808
...how many men, good men...

55:45.888 --> 55:48.765
...that behemoth has had killed.

55:49.308 --> 55:53.427
My own brothers,
killed in the street like fuckin' dogs!

55:53.507 --> 55:57.938
And Frankie Yale, Capone had him
shot down in new York just last week.

55:58.018 --> 56:00.481
Yeah, you know why? Because of me...

56:00.561 --> 56:06.042
...because Frankie backed me
to run the Sicilian Union...

56:06.122 --> 56:09.013
...so we don't have to use Capone's man...

56:09.093 --> 56:11.538
...Tony Lombardo, that fat prick.

56:12.598 --> 56:14.522
I think we're all in agreement, here.

56:14.602 --> 56:18.045
We've had a longstanding problem
and it needs to be fixed.

56:18.125 --> 56:20.196
Frank, Pete...

56:21.741 --> 56:24.291
...I'm offering you
50,000 dollars to kill Capone.

56:24.778 --> 56:26.319
But first...

56:27.223 --> 56:31.358
...I want you to take out
his machine gunner, Jack McGurn.

56:33.519 --> 56:35.463
We'll do him for free.

56:50.229 --> 56:51.758
Lulu!

56:52.923 --> 56:55.228
Lulu, I love you!

56:55.308 --> 56:58.282
You're the bee's knees,
you've always been my bee's knees!

56:58.362 --> 57:01.070
Lulu, Lulu.

57:01.150 --> 57:04.982
Come here, Lulu. Lulu, I love you,
I love you, come here. Lulu.

57:05.072 --> 57:07.675
Just... Lulu, Lulu, I love you.

57:07.755 --> 57:09.256
Psst, Lulu!

57:17.163 --> 57:20.690
Marry me, Lulu. Lulu, Lulu, Lulu, look, look.

57:53.766 --> 57:57.658
You can't just come in here and take out
every guy that looks at me twice.

57:57.738 --> 57:59.713
Now you see here...

57:59.793 --> 58:03.239
...I agreed to let you dance,
but I never agreed to that.

58:09.048 --> 58:12.476
Now you listen to me, slugger.

58:14.153 --> 58:17.211
I don't need your permission for anything.

58:17.891 --> 58:20.851
Hell, I don't need any man's permission.

58:25.431 --> 58:28.092
I've gotten myself this far.

58:31.037 --> 58:32.596
Baby.

58:37.026 --> 58:38.666
Baby, I'm sorry.

58:38.746 --> 58:41.535
Look, I got carried away.

58:41.615 --> 58:43.508
Okay, I wasn't thinking.

58:46.218 --> 58:49.830
I just came here to pick you up
and take you home, that's all.

58:51.520 --> 58:53.786
Why don't we get out of here?

58:54.828 --> 58:56.657
I've got a better idea.

58:57.297 --> 58:59.550
Why don't you get out of here.

59:17.183 --> 59:19.045
- Yeah.
- <i>This is Jack...</i>

59:19.125 --> 59:22.385
...all in all we got six
different businesses ready to go.

59:22.465 --> 59:24.946
- That's my boy, Jackie.
- <i>Listen, Al.</i>

59:25.326 --> 59:27.981
If the machines are ready,
I can deliver them tomorrow.

59:28.061 --> 59:30.184
<i>No, no, Anselmi and Scalise
is picking 'em up.</i>

59:30.264 --> 59:32.644
<i>I just want you to focus
on getting more locations.</i>

59:32.724 --> 59:35.693
All right, I'm on it. Just be sure to...

59:42.124 --> 59:43.483
<i>Jackie?</i>

59:44.410 --> 59:45.969
Jackie?

59:46.479 --> 59:48.067
<i>Jackie?</i>

59:48.147 --> 59:49.706
<i>Jackie!</i>

59:50.082 --> 59:51.641
<i>Jackie!</i>

01:00:00.159 --> 01:00:01.983
He's lost too much blood.

01:00:02.963 --> 01:00:06.368
We're losing him. Hang in there, Jack!

01:00:22.681 --> 01:00:24.240
Daddy!

01:00:25.785 --> 01:00:27.608
You made it.

01:00:27.988 --> 01:00:29.826
I was so scared.

01:00:36.629 --> 01:00:40.035
I never lost faith, Jack.
I knew you was a fighter.

01:00:40.868 --> 01:00:43.592
I guess it's that boxing mentality, huh?

01:00:44.822 --> 01:00:47.661
And don't worry about the bill,
I got that covered.

01:00:48.341 --> 01:00:50.164
You just get rested.

01:00:50.494 --> 01:00:52.517
When you're better you come see me.

01:00:53.287 --> 01:00:55.129
We'll take care of business.

01:01:02.855 --> 01:01:04.391
Jack...

01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:08.896
...what were you thinking going out
and getting yourself shot up like that?

01:01:09.563 --> 01:01:13.224
And don't think you're off the hook
for the other night either, mister.

01:01:17.636 --> 01:01:19.746
I'm worried about you.

01:01:21.073 --> 01:01:23.500
Don't worry about me.

01:01:24.527 --> 01:01:26.536
I'll be okay.

01:01:29.281 --> 01:01:30.840
Okay.

01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:34.859
Just promise me when you're all
healed up we'll go away somewhere.

01:01:35.989 --> 01:01:38.415
Anything you want, sweetheart.

01:01:39.926 --> 01:01:41.785
I just...

01:01:42.828 --> 01:01:45.088
...I just need some rest.

01:02:00.426 --> 01:02:03.051
Goddamn it, he's alive!

01:02:04.016 --> 01:02:06.740
McGurn just walked out of the hospital.

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.109
What the fuck did I tell you?

01:02:09.489 --> 01:02:12.426
- What were you supposed to do?
- Impossible.

01:02:12.506 --> 01:02:16.119
- We filled the guy full of holes.
- No, you didn't!

01:02:22.108 --> 01:02:24.580
That's how you shoot something full of holes!

01:02:26.423 --> 01:02:29.029
I heard Capone is in Palm Beach.

01:02:29.389 --> 01:02:30.932
Yeah?

01:02:31.712 --> 01:02:35.452
Well, you better hope to God
that he stays there.

01:02:39.218 --> 01:02:41.045
Clean this shit up!

01:02:44.891 --> 01:02:48.515
- Are the caterers set for next week?
- Yeah, florists too.

01:02:48.595 --> 01:02:51.685
- Should be quite the shindig.
- Good, it better be.

01:02:52.065 --> 01:02:55.322
Hostin' the D.A.'s no different
in Florida than it is in Chicago.

01:02:55.902 --> 01:02:59.197
You want to do business,
you gotta do a little wining and dining.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.470
Look who finally decided to show up.

01:03:10.723 --> 01:03:13.544
Oh, my God, it's like a movie set!

01:03:17.523 --> 01:03:19.340
Even better, sweetheart...

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.416
...it's not make believe.

01:03:22.996 --> 01:03:24.851
How you doin', Jackie?

01:03:24.931 --> 01:03:28.321
Still a little sore, I'll be alright though.

01:03:28.401 --> 01:03:31.782
Louise, how about you go join Rio
in the back? He'll make you a mimosa.

01:03:32.172 --> 01:03:35.161
- A what?
- A mimosa.

01:03:35.241 --> 01:03:38.131
Champagne with fresh
Florida orange juice in it.

01:03:38.599 --> 01:03:42.008
My God, I think I can get used to this.

01:03:44.316 --> 01:03:46.323
I appreciate you taking care of things.

01:03:46.403 --> 01:03:50.615
Don't mention it. I gotta talk to you
about something, come on.

01:03:55.594 --> 01:03:57.454
Sit down, Jack.

01:04:09.475 --> 01:04:11.318
I want them, Al.

01:04:12.831 --> 01:04:14.671
Easy, Jack.

01:04:15.314 --> 01:04:17.171
You gotta play this smart.

01:04:17.951 --> 01:04:20.840
You can't just go into
the flower shop and start blastin'.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.778
I know.

01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:27.920
I just want to get your blessing
before I go back.

01:04:32.598 --> 01:04:36.009
- What's your play?
- Abe Bernstein.

01:04:37.453 --> 01:04:40.027
He still runnin' truckloads of whiskey?

01:04:40.107 --> 01:04:44.464
That old bastard?
Been sellin' hootch to me, Moran...

01:04:44.544 --> 01:04:46.767
...everyone and his fuckin' mother.

01:04:47.447 --> 01:04:50.505
And he still owes you for operating
without interference, right?

01:05:00.008 --> 01:05:01.817
Go on.

01:05:05.514 --> 01:05:07.648
Here's how we do this.

01:05:15.741 --> 01:05:18.568
- Yeah.
- <i>Boychick, how are you?</i>

01:05:19.679 --> 01:05:23.953
Abe Berstein, you old kike.
Are you still alive?

01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:28.878
I'll dance on your grave,
you Irish potato eater.

01:05:29.455 --> 01:05:33.069
- What's on your mind, Abe?
- Well, you may have heard, but...

01:05:33.149 --> 01:05:38.000
...our old friend 'Mr. Brown'
is down in Miami.

01:05:39.097 --> 01:05:42.756
But with him gone,
some of his boys got a little careless.

01:05:42.836 --> 01:05:46.259
And one of my guys pinched one of his trucks.

01:05:46.739 --> 01:05:49.743
The good stuff, Canadian whiskey.

01:05:49.993 --> 01:05:52.823
<i>I can let you have it for fifty bucks a case.</i>

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.335
Yeah, well, like I always say...

01:05:55.415 --> 01:05:58.122
...any liquor of that fat beast
is liquor of mine.

01:05:58.752 --> 01:06:01.321
- <i>When can you deliver it?</i>
- How's tomorrow morning?

01:06:01.401 --> 01:06:05.578
- Perfect. You know where my warehouse is?
- <i>2120 North Clark.</i>

01:06:05.658 --> 01:06:07.846
Have them drop it off
at 10 a.m. I'll be there.

01:06:07.926 --> 01:06:09.967
<i>Mazel and Brocha.</i>

01:06:14.933 --> 01:06:16.759
How's that?

01:06:20.522 --> 01:06:22.862
Couldn't have been better.

01:06:22.942 --> 01:06:24.835
Give my regards to Al.

01:06:42.261 --> 01:06:44.117
Right on time.

01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:46.837
- This is for Abe.
- Thanks.

01:06:46.917 --> 01:06:50.344
I'm gonna go grab a bite to eat.
I'll be back when you're done unloading.

01:06:51.304 --> 01:06:55.547
- You wanna give me a hand with these?
- Fuck that, Frankie. We're on time.

01:06:55.627 --> 01:06:57.939
The other guys are late, let them unload it.

01:07:03.181 --> 01:07:04.972
What the hell is this?

01:07:05.152 --> 01:07:08.641
You got me, boss. Maybe an accident?

01:07:08.721 --> 01:07:12.679
Well, cut down one of the side streets.
We're late for the shipment as it is.

01:07:12.759 --> 01:07:15.219
Go on, go around them, come on.

01:07:24.153 --> 01:07:26.012
Isn't that Moran?

01:07:27.139 --> 01:07:29.368
Can't see his face real good.

01:07:31.209 --> 01:07:33.307
I mean, yeah, it's gotta be.

01:07:39.651 --> 01:07:41.210
Yeah?

01:07:43.355 --> 01:07:45.181
We're on our way.

01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:48.984
Let's go.

01:07:55.607 --> 01:07:57.557
So what have we got?

01:07:57.637 --> 01:08:00.927
You got fifty cases,
about a dozen bottles per case.

01:08:01.007 --> 01:08:05.031
Once you water it down,
you guys are about fifty grand.

01:08:05.111 --> 01:08:07.634
Considerin' we paid Abe
a fourth of that, not too bad.

01:08:07.714 --> 01:08:10.206
Who said the Jews were good with money?

01:08:15.994 --> 01:08:19.045
Brought her home, you know, slapped her
around a little bit, she likes that.

01:08:19.125 --> 01:08:22.349
Alright, everybody,
grab a piece of that wall!

01:08:22.429 --> 01:08:23.527
What?

01:08:23.607 --> 01:08:25.841
- You heard him, move!
- You boys new to the force?

01:08:25.921 --> 01:08:28.388
- You don't know how this works?
- We know how this works, hit the wall.

01:08:28.468 --> 01:08:32.234
If you're lookin' for a payoff, we already
paid up this month. But I'll tell you what...

01:08:32.314 --> 01:08:35.563
- ...we'll let each of you grab a bottle.
- Shut your mouth and face the wall.

01:08:51.957 --> 01:08:54.447
If this is a beef about concealed weapons...

01:08:54.727 --> 01:08:58.017
...our lawyers will get that beat
with one phone call.

01:08:58.096 --> 01:09:00.386
You think we should give you a phone call?

01:09:00.867 --> 01:09:04.361
That's funny, you never let me finish mine.

01:09:37.903 --> 01:09:39.729
Where's Moran?

01:09:41.169 --> 01:09:43.470
Where the fuck is Moran?
They said he was here!

01:09:47.546 --> 01:09:50.203
Wait, wait, wait. Coppers.

01:09:50.283 --> 01:09:52.926
- What the hell do they want?
- A bust?

01:09:53.006 --> 01:09:56.213
Nah, probably just looking for a payoff.

01:10:02.084 --> 01:10:05.818
McGurn, what the hell is he doing here?

01:10:26.418 --> 01:10:28.275
Boss, we gotta go.

01:10:28.855 --> 01:10:30.675
Boss, we gotta go!

01:10:43.702 --> 01:10:45.592
You want us to go after McGurn?

01:10:46.022 --> 01:10:48.514
No, just drive.

01:10:53.979 --> 01:10:58.335
You know, up till now the people of Chicago
have looked on these gangland killings...

01:10:58.415 --> 01:11:00.390
...almost like entertainment.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:04.471
A little radio drama in the morning
they can listen to over their corn flakes.

01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:06.446
But this is sick.

01:11:06.526 --> 01:11:09.095
I think this might actually
be a good thing for us.

01:11:09.175 --> 01:11:10.917
Good, how?

01:11:10.997 --> 01:11:14.462
One of the dead men was just
a mechanic, another was an optician...

01:11:14.542 --> 01:11:17.323
...who just liked to pal around
with tough guys.

01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:20.560
If men like these can be
lined up and gunned down...

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.497
...then your average person
is going to feel no one is safe.

01:11:24.577 --> 01:11:27.800
The public's finally going to demand
that these men be taken down.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:30.703
But how does that help us do our job?

01:11:30.783 --> 01:11:33.740
We can never get witnesses to come forward.

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.375
We can't make arrests stick.

01:11:35.455 --> 01:11:40.743
Which is why Mr. Hoover has decided
to go after Capone on tax fraud.

01:11:40.823 --> 01:11:43.852
Doesn't matter what the charges are
when half the damn cops in the city...

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:45.966
...are on Capone's payroll.

01:11:50.268 --> 01:11:55.162
Our bureau is going to drag Mr. Capone
into court on federal charges, Detective.

01:11:55.642 --> 01:11:59.665
In the meantime, I suggest you and your
men round up the rest of these criminals...

01:11:59.745 --> 01:12:02.039
...on whatever charges you can think up.

01:12:10.055 --> 01:12:11.625
Now...

01:12:11.705 --> 01:12:15.235
...if you gentlemen don't mind,
we'd like some privacy.

01:12:33.579 --> 01:12:36.569
Do you believe the way that O'Connor
was kissing that G-man's ass?

01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:38.007
I mean, it was like...

01:12:39.339 --> 01:12:42.341
You know what? You can play
the fool with everybody else...

01:12:42.421 --> 01:12:44.844
...but your bullshit doesn't fly with me.

01:12:44.924 --> 01:12:46.851
- Where's McGurn?
- Get your fuckin'...

01:12:46.931 --> 01:12:49.480
Maybe you have not noticed,
I'm not part of your little boys club.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.252
I don't play by those rules
or those fake codes.

01:12:53.332 --> 01:12:57.023
I'm gonna ask you one more time,
Detective, once.

01:12:57.103 --> 01:12:58.995
Where's McGurn?

01:13:06.411 --> 01:13:10.637
Chicago's so cold in the winter.
When are we gonna go to Florida again?

01:13:10.717 --> 01:13:14.520
I already told ya. I'll give Al a call,
we'll see what happens.

01:13:22.595 --> 01:13:25.856
- Who's that?
- I ordered room service.

01:13:27.599 --> 01:13:29.157
Again?

01:13:29.467 --> 01:13:31.761
What d'ya got, a hollow leg?

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:43.937
I'm taking you in, kid.

01:13:44.017 --> 01:13:47.108
- What for?
- You're under arrest...

01:13:47.188 --> 01:13:50.477
...for suspicion of murder
in the Valentine's Day massacre.

01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:54.647
- He was here with me the whole time!
- You tell that to the judge, sweetheart.

01:13:54.727 --> 01:13:57.205
- We're going to bring you in as well.
- What's the charge?

01:13:57.285 --> 01:14:00.838
Taking a woman across state lines for
immoral purposes. That good enough?

01:14:01.278 --> 01:14:04.457
You both conspired to violate the Mann act.

01:14:04.537 --> 01:14:06.096
You fucked up, Jack.

01:14:07.405 --> 01:14:09.432
You fucked up.

01:14:34.566 --> 01:14:36.392
Take a seat, Jack.

01:14:50.148 --> 01:14:52.008
Did you rat me out, Jack?

01:14:56.221 --> 01:14:58.448
What kind of question is that?

01:15:00.292 --> 01:15:02.521
It's a pretty fucking good question.

01:15:03.246 --> 01:15:06.093
After everything I've done for you.

01:15:07.165 --> 01:15:09.801
You're gonna ask me that question?

01:15:12.237 --> 01:15:14.026
Who brought you up, Jack?

01:15:14.106 --> 01:15:15.986
You may have started me...

01:15:16.666 --> 01:15:18.471
...but I earned my way up.

01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:21.821
Yeah, but I can fuckin' take it
away from you, can't I?

01:15:31.857 --> 01:15:33.613
The word is that the cops and the feds...

01:15:33.693 --> 01:15:36.715
...they're pretty embarrassed
by your court appearance today.

01:15:37.747 --> 01:15:40.965
And they're gonna keep coming
after you any way they can.

01:15:47.873 --> 01:15:52.363
So until things blow over,
I need to ask you a favor.

01:15:52.745 --> 01:15:54.570
Yeah, what's that?

01:15:55.547 --> 01:15:57.350
I need you to lay low.

01:16:00.552 --> 01:16:02.649
I need you to move out to the suburbs.

01:16:03.783 --> 01:16:05.612
Be in charge of collecting.

01:16:06.592 --> 01:16:08.817
Al, come on.

01:16:10.962 --> 01:16:14.039
You want me to be a bag man in the 'burbs?

01:16:15.894 --> 01:16:17.724
It's just for a little while.

01:16:18.504 --> 01:16:20.286
It's a death sentence.

01:16:24.275 --> 01:16:27.337
Al, we need you out here, it's important.

01:16:32.083 --> 01:16:33.935
Yeah, I'm coming.

01:16:39.007 --> 01:16:42.493
Listen, Jack, thanks for understanding.

01:16:44.462 --> 01:16:46.500
You'll be back here in no time.

01:17:39.818 --> 01:17:41.884
Alphonse Capone...

01:17:42.379 --> 01:17:46.846
...you have been found guilty
of violation of federal tax law...

01:17:46.926 --> 01:17:51.242
...for the years 1925 through 1929.

01:17:51.322 --> 01:17:54.487
You will be confined
to a federal penitentiary...

01:17:54.567 --> 01:17:56.962
- What?
- ...for not less than 10 years.

01:17:57.042 --> 01:17:59.084
You can't do this!
Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:17:59.164 --> 01:18:02.161
- Escort Mr. Capone out of the court room.
- Do you know who I am?

01:18:02.241 --> 01:18:04.517
Do you fuckin' know who I am!

01:18:05.417 --> 01:18:07.666
I'm fuckin' Al Capone!

01:18:07.746 --> 01:18:10.290
You fuckin' better remember me!

01:18:21.726 --> 01:18:24.383
You didn't like
your Valentine's dinner I made?

01:18:24.463 --> 01:18:26.722
Yeah, baby, it was great.

01:18:29.601 --> 01:18:33.211
I was just thinking back when I was a kid.

01:18:34.239 --> 01:18:36.663
I was thinking about who I used to be.

01:18:37.493 --> 01:18:39.469
Just a kid who wanted to box.

01:18:40.329 --> 01:18:44.540
Make some prize money,
take care of my family.

01:18:48.786 --> 01:18:51.080
I just can't help but wonder...

01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:55.285
...if the Gennas had just left my pop alone.

01:19:02.233 --> 01:19:04.691
I don't know who I'm supposed to be anymore.

01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:07.566
Al's gone. Frank Nitti's
runnin' the south side...

01:19:07.646 --> 01:19:10.313
...he don't want nothin' to do
with the old gang.

01:19:11.844 --> 01:19:15.880
- I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
- I'll tell you what you're supposed to do.

01:19:16.348 --> 01:19:21.436
You're supposed to sit there,
looking at me and be happy.

01:19:24.656 --> 01:19:27.242
Did you forget, mister?

01:19:27.322 --> 01:19:30.917
Walking into that dressing room
seven years ago and giving me this?

01:19:30.997 --> 01:19:33.019
How could I forget?

01:19:33.099 --> 01:19:35.287
It's the smartest thing I ever did.

01:19:35.367 --> 01:19:36.888
Well.

01:19:37.328 --> 01:19:40.059
I actually think of today
as our anniversary...

01:19:40.139 --> 01:19:42.554
...and not the day we actually got married.

01:19:43.559 --> 01:19:45.843
And I think we should celebrate.

01:19:48.323 --> 01:19:50.178
You're right.

01:19:53.018 --> 01:19:55.207
I'll go get us some champagne.

01:19:55.287 --> 01:19:56.660
Good.

01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:59.799
Take a little walk,
see if I can get out of this funk.

01:20:04.479 --> 01:20:06.038
You...

01:20:08.199 --> 01:20:10.459
...I love you so much.

01:20:10.668 --> 01:20:12.528
I love you.

01:20:31.122 --> 01:20:33.146
Practicing for the tournament?

01:20:33.926 --> 01:20:35.781
A hundred bucks is a hundred bucks.

01:20:35.861 --> 01:20:39.332
Yeah, you can buy your girl
a lot of candy and flowers with that.

01:20:43.601 --> 01:20:46.842
I actually gotta go pick up some champagne.

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:50.600
Celebrating, huh?

01:20:53.728 --> 01:20:57.337
Hey, you remember February 14th
from a few years ago, right?

01:20:58.317 --> 01:21:01.507
Nah, I can barely remember
what I was doing yesterday.

01:21:01.587 --> 01:21:03.346
Maybe this'll help remind you.

01:21:27.228 --> 01:21:29.648
Happy Valentine's Day, Jack.
