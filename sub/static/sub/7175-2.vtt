WEBVTT

00:01.905 --> 00:03.438
I'm afraid she's dead, John.

00:04.297 --> 00:08.000
I didn't put her down...
or have her put down.

00:11.056 --> 00:13.761
Why did you steal the phone I
used to call Alice Morgan?

00:14.205 --> 00:15.235
What did he do with the heart?

00:15.351 --> 00:16.435
He ate it.

00:19.729 --> 00:20.741
Animal like that...

00:21.572 --> 00:23.447
he's always moving forward.

00:23.595 --> 00:27.391
All their computers were fixed
by one man, Steven Rose.

00:27.416 --> 00:28.598
That's him.

00:28.623 --> 00:32.085
Benny! Stop this...

00:33.388 --> 00:36.264
Steven.

00:36.289 --> 00:39.124
- Can we salvage anything from this.
- Too soon to tell, boss.

00:47.528 --> 00:49.808
Sorry, Guv. She's asked
for you by name.

00:56.288 --> 00:58.247
Can I help?

00:58.248 --> 01:00.008
Are you DCI Luther?

01:02.128 --> 01:04.007
Yeah.

01:04.007 --> 01:05.447
I have a message for you.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.607
A message from who?

01:09.608 --> 01:11.167
Alice Morgan.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:21.368 --> 01:23.047
What kind of message?

01:23.048 --> 01:25.968
She said to tell John
that Stacey has the owl.

01:33.848 --> 01:35.967
When did she give you this message?

01:35.968 --> 01:37.887
Last night.

01:37.888 --> 01:40.895
See, that's not true, is it?
Because Alice is dead.

01:40.943 --> 01:42.006
I know.

01:43.608 --> 01:45.807
I'm sorry, who are you?

01:45.808 --> 01:47.488
Look, I'm just here to help.

01:49.698 --> 01:52.338
- And how do you know Alice?
- I don't.

01:53.938 --> 01:57.337
- So, what? She just appears to you?
- Yes.

01:57.338 --> 01:59.698
- And did she say anything else?
- Not really.

02:02.618 --> 02:04.378
There was one thing.

02:06.658 --> 02:09.698
Something I don't really
understand, I'm sorry.

02:10.978 --> 02:12.698
Something like what?

02:14.738 --> 02:16.818
"Meep meep."

02:22.898 --> 02:24.817
Put this woman in the car and cuff her.

02:24.818 --> 02:27.137
Down there, thank you.

02:27.138 --> 02:28.817
What's all this?

02:28.818 --> 02:31.474
Er, don't ask. What's going on?

02:31.978 --> 02:33.170
We've got another one.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.618
How much of the brain did he eat?

03:46.818 --> 03:49.177
Roberta Wise.

03:49.178 --> 03:52.657
She's a Professor of Economics,
University of London.

03:52.658 --> 03:56.218
- A government adviser and...
- And then this.

03:57.818 --> 03:59.897
Look at her life.

03:59.898 --> 04:01.817
Look at what he took from her.

04:01.818 --> 04:04.457
This wasn't murder, this was theft.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.657
Come again?

04:06.658 --> 04:10.137
I think he's this clever, little
lonely man, slowly falling apart,

04:10.138 --> 04:13.297
spending his days watching
the lives of others.

04:13.298 --> 04:14.737
And you know what that's like...

04:14.738 --> 04:17.257
other people's lives seem
so much better than ours.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.858
More interesting, more
attractive, more alive.

04:22.898 --> 04:25.097
The way he sees it, they got
something that he needs

04:25.098 --> 04:27.458
so, he's just going
to take it from them.

04:30.458 --> 04:31.777
No, he's never going to stop,

04:31.778 --> 04:33.817
he's just going to keep
doing it and doing it,

04:33.818 --> 04:36.218
because he'll never get
back whatever he's lost.

04:37.498 --> 04:39.178
None of us ever do.

04:53.858 --> 04:56.657
Don't stop, love. Drive on.

04:56.658 --> 04:58.417
I can't. Look at him.

04:58.418 --> 05:01.218
Then let's call the police.
They'll deal with it.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.698
What if it was Declan?

05:08.298 --> 05:11.617
- You all right, mate?
- You all right, love? What's happened?

05:11.618 --> 05:13.297
What have you done to yourself?

05:13.298 --> 05:16.217
I'm so sorry... thank you
for stopping, I'm so sorry.

05:16.218 --> 05:17.577
I'm so sorry.

05:17.578 --> 05:20.377
No, no.

06:24.338 --> 06:26.297
Well, needs must, innit?

06:26.298 --> 06:28.337
Thanks for the hospitality.

06:28.338 --> 06:32.297
No, George... I just had to figure out
who killed Alice Morgan. All right?

06:32.298 --> 06:34.617
I'm sorry it ended up
the way it did but...

06:34.618 --> 06:38.897
I'll put it right. To tell you the
truth, I am tempted to let it lie.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.857
I mean, you are obviously
a decent chap.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.897
But you did what you did
in front of my son.

06:42.898 --> 06:46.457
'If I start showing weakness to him...
well, it's nature's way, isn't it?'

06:46.458 --> 06:49.017
The Lion King. Hakuna Matata.

06:49.018 --> 06:51.817
Er, I think you're thinking
about the wrong song.

06:51.818 --> 06:54.417
'What one am I thinking of, then?'

06:54.418 --> 06:59.737
Oh, "Hakuna Matata", that's the happy
one, right? "No more worries."

06:59.738 --> 07:01.857
That one. That's the one.

07:01.858 --> 07:04.378
Then, I'm definitely
thinking of the wrong song.

07:05.858 --> 07:08.417
I've put a price on your head, John.

07:08.418 --> 07:09.218
How much?

07:09.243 --> 07:11.617
'Out of interest, how much
do you think you're worth?'

07:11.618 --> 07:15.217
Well, probably not enough for a
good night out and a cab ride home.

07:15.218 --> 07:17.817
Well, I'm honestly down
in the dumps about it.

07:17.818 --> 07:20.017
But you did bring it down on yourself.

07:20.018 --> 07:23.697
'So, you're a dead man walking.'

07:23.698 --> 07:25.658
Toodle pip.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.177
Hey.

08:20.178 --> 08:24.697
We've got Steven Rose leaving
the building at 21:32pm.

08:24.698 --> 08:28.657
We follow him down here, down
here and then... well, he's gone.

08:28.658 --> 08:31.777
Off camera. Yeah. How many
bodies we got looking for him?

08:31.778 --> 08:33.777
All of them, I think.

08:33.778 --> 08:37.017
- Aerial units. Ground units. Dog units.
- Good.

08:37.018 --> 08:41.217
They won't find him.
But, er, keep looking.

08:41.217 --> 08:43.616
"Cut
the chatter, Red 2.

08:43.618 --> 08:45.297
"Accelerate to attack speed."

08:45.298 --> 08:47.978
What? What was that?

08:49.898 --> 08:51.658
Sorry. Erm...

08:53.138 --> 08:57.417
Theo and me... DCI Bloom...

08:57.418 --> 09:00.058
He quite liked the odd
Star Wars reference.

09:01.178 --> 09:03.098
"Not this ship, sister."

09:08.218 --> 09:09.978
Do you know any David Bowie?

09:13.778 --> 09:18.497
Erm... Yeah, I liked
him in, in that film.

09:18.498 --> 09:21.777
The one in the maze. With the baby.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.498
And the puppets...

09:25.258 --> 09:27.897
We Are The Dead.

09:27.898 --> 09:29.697
I'm sorry?

09:29.698 --> 09:33.897
Well, there's this thing.
Cotard's Syndrome.

09:33.898 --> 09:36.817
OK. It's a delusional mental illness

09:36.818 --> 09:41.257
and the patient thinks that
he's dead and decomposing.

09:41.258 --> 09:44.657
And the cannibalism? That's a symptom?

09:44.658 --> 09:46.617
No, not usually.

09:46.618 --> 09:49.257
I mean, I'm making a...

09:49.258 --> 09:53.937
a leap. Well, it's a small leap...
it's more of a hop, really.

09:53.938 --> 09:56.658
So, how do we get ahead of him?

09:59.138 --> 10:02.057
See, I think he's like
a feral dog right now

10:02.058 --> 10:04.177
trying to find a place to hide.

10:04.178 --> 10:07.937
I think we lean into that. I think
we go public, put his name and face

10:07.938 --> 10:10.457
to the media, force him into one place.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.777
Keep him still and then...

10:12.778 --> 10:15.257
figure out what he does next.

10:15.258 --> 10:18.297
And you think he's rational
enough for us to be able do that?

10:18.298 --> 10:20.737
He's delusional, but not deranged.

10:20.738 --> 10:25.857
I mean, the way he sees it, he's just
going to do what's necessary to...

10:25.858 --> 10:29.898
to get what he needs just
to keep going, you know?

10:31.218 --> 10:33.537
How you doing, Ben?
Like an anxiety dream.

10:33.538 --> 10:36.337
I have to keep checking I'm
still wearing trousers.

10:36.338 --> 10:39.137
Well, we can't move without knowing
what's on them hard drives.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.938
- Guv, you got a minute?
- Sure.

10:53.298 --> 10:59.257
Jonathan Black, March, 1999, is
lured into a park, suffocated.

10:59.258 --> 11:04.017
All right, SIO had the killer down
as Brian Elder, local sex offender.

11:04.018 --> 11:08.857
Next day, Brian Elder
drowns himself in a canal.

11:08.858 --> 11:12.218
Jonathan Black's underpants
in his pocket. Slam dunk.

11:15.138 --> 11:17.338
Is she in the file?

11:19.498 --> 11:22.817
No, she's not. But I am.

11:22.818 --> 11:25.777
See, I didn't think Brian
Elder killed himself, right?

11:25.778 --> 11:27.217
I don't think he did it.

11:27.218 --> 11:29.498
I actually think this girl did it.

11:30.978 --> 11:32.577
Stacey Bell.

11:32.578 --> 11:34.577
Back then, no one was
paying attention to me,

11:34.578 --> 11:36.777
I was still wet behind the
ears, but I was right.

11:36.778 --> 11:39.217
When she was 17, she got
done for manslaughter.

11:39.218 --> 11:42.657
She pushed her nan down the
stairs and let her die.

11:42.658 --> 11:45.337
She just got out two
and a half months ago.

11:45.338 --> 11:49.768
You know there's nothing to it?
This psychic drivel, right?

11:53.458 --> 11:56.577
She knows something about Alice Morgan.

12:07.818 --> 12:10.697
So, you're a partner in
a Corporate PR Firm?

12:10.698 --> 12:12.618
Yes. That's right.

12:13.938 --> 12:16.297
So, what are you doing here?

12:16.298 --> 12:20.738
You're educated, financially
stable, I just don't get it.

12:22.058 --> 12:26.697
- I'm not sure what you're implying.
- Well, clairvoyants are...

12:26.698 --> 12:28.978
confidence tricksters, aren't they?

12:29.978 --> 12:32.714
Grave robbers preying on
the lonely and bereaved.

12:32.739 --> 12:34.137
That's not what I do.

12:34.138 --> 12:36.258
- No?
- No.

12:37.418 --> 12:41.937
I don't broadcast this,
let alone profit from it.

12:41.938 --> 12:46.418
In fact, most of my life I've
pretended it wasn't happening to me.

12:47.698 --> 12:49.377
Why?

12:49.378 --> 12:51.218
Because it's horrible.

12:53.218 --> 12:57.337
I don't to be here doing this.
I don't want to be...

12:57.338 --> 12:59.817
humiliated and frightened.

12:59.818 --> 13:01.898
I don't want this to be happening.

13:04.938 --> 13:10.418
I woke up in the middle of the
night and she was standing there.

13:12.378 --> 13:16.098
"Tell John that Stacey
Bell has the owl."

13:17.098 --> 13:19.378
- Who's Stacey?
- I don't know.

13:20.618 --> 13:23.738
- What owl are we talking about?
- I'm not sure.

13:28.498 --> 13:30.858
Thing is, it does actually make sense.

13:37.338 --> 13:42.337
Jonathan Black had a
favourite toy and, er,

13:42.338 --> 13:44.458
it disappeared when he disappeared.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.697
Of course, all of that
was kept from the press.

13:48.698 --> 13:51.378
I mean, no one actually...
no one knew that.

13:52.538 --> 13:54.498
So, how do you know it?

14:00.858 --> 14:03.177
She's here.

14:03.178 --> 14:05.098
She's standing behind you.

14:06.218 --> 14:07.897
Who?

14:07.898 --> 14:10.618
Her mouth is moving, but
I can't hear her words.

14:14.898 --> 14:17.857
- I can make out what she's saying, though.
- Yeah?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.658
What is she saying?

14:22.298 --> 14:24.618
Tell John, "Hell is real."

14:46.378 --> 14:48.817
I can find a connection
if there's one there,

14:48.818 --> 14:51.057
but John, I don't think there is.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.018
That poor wee lad died years ago.

14:54.098 --> 14:58.617
Alice died a couple of days ago in Antwerp.
There's no connection.

14:58.618 --> 15:02.137
So, because you can't believe
it's true, logically it's false.

15:02.138 --> 15:05.537
Is that really an argument now? Ey?

15:05.538 --> 15:10.017
Benny, listen to me, I told
Alice Morgan about this,

15:10.018 --> 15:12.817
I told her about Jonathan
Black, Stacey Bell.

15:12.818 --> 15:16.217
I told her how it made me feel.
How I couldn't...

15:16.218 --> 15:18.097
how I couldn't put it right.

15:18.098 --> 15:19.737
What did she say?

15:19.738 --> 15:22.458
"Let's find Stacey Bell
and set her on fire."

15:24.258 --> 15:25.657
But that's not the point.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.097
I don't know what, I don't
know what the point is.

15:28.098 --> 15:32.377
The point is, I told Alice Morgan.
I didn't tell anybody else.

15:32.378 --> 15:37.137
The only way that Megan could know
that is if Alice Morgan told her.

15:37.138 --> 15:38.818
That's it.

15:40.178 --> 15:44.017
Now... she knows something.

15:44.018 --> 15:47.898
She knows something, I don't know
what it is, but I just need to know.

15:50.858 --> 15:56.098
Well, if it can be done,
consider it done.

16:03.258 --> 16:05.618
- You getting anywhere?
- Somewhere.

16:08.338 --> 16:11.458
- You all right, there?
- He killed Theo, Benny.

16:12.698 --> 16:15.097
I want to find him.

16:15.098 --> 16:17.578
I want to rip HIS heart out and eat it.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.378
So, hurry up.

16:24.338 --> 16:26.457
DS Lane? Boss?

16:26.458 --> 16:28.977
I need you to go to Steven
Rose's place of work.

16:28.978 --> 16:32.657
I want you to speak to his boss, his
colleagues, friends, lovers, whoever.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.498
Find out what there is to know about him.
See what there is on him.

16:36.618 --> 16:40.097
What's this, busywork?
Keep me out of your hair?

16:40.098 --> 16:41.617
Nope.

16:41.618 --> 16:43.098
Chop, chop.

16:56.538 --> 16:58.337
Morning, babe.

16:58.338 --> 17:00.058
You awake?

17:01.058 --> 17:03.297
No, no.

17:03.298 --> 17:06.058
No, everything's fine, it's fine.
I just, er...

17:07.617 --> 17:11.257
Well, I'm just calling because
I don't want you to worry!

17:11.258 --> 17:13.778
Look, I'm going to be
home the minute I can.

17:14.858 --> 17:17.097
Yes, I will.

17:17.098 --> 17:19.298
I promise.

17:21.098 --> 17:23.018
I love you, too.

17:24.578 --> 17:26.057
Sleep.

17:26.058 --> 17:27.978
Sleep.

18:14.498 --> 18:16.737
'Leave a message after the beep.'

18:16.738 --> 18:20.257
Mum? It's Declan. I just got your text.
Is everything all right?

18:28.458 --> 18:30.738
You all right? Yeah.

18:33.258 --> 18:36.657
Actually, I... I dunno. It's
a bit weird, it's me mum.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.417
Do you mind if I nip off for a bit?

18:38.418 --> 18:40.658
- Nah. You go home, mate.
- Cheers, Mohan.

19:39.858 --> 19:41.778
Tara Black?

19:46.458 --> 19:50.857
So, how've you been?

19:50.858 --> 19:54.738
I remember you. Constable Luther.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.217
You were very kind.

19:59.218 --> 20:01.937
You seemed to care about my brother.

20:01.938 --> 20:04.217
Well, thank you.

20:04.218 --> 20:06.817
I did.

20:06.818 --> 20:11.057
I don't want to upset you, or worry
you, but when someone approaches us

20:11.058 --> 20:14.137
with fresh information, we're
obliged to review the case.

20:14.138 --> 20:15.817
So, that's what this is?

20:15.818 --> 20:17.178
Fresh information?

20:18.338 --> 20:22.737
During the investigation we, erm...
withheld information.

20:22.738 --> 20:25.457
- George Owly.
- Yeah, but...

20:25.458 --> 20:28.937
have you been talking
to someone about that?

20:28.938 --> 20:32.177
- Not that I can think of.
- Not any pushy journalist,

20:32.178 --> 20:34.497
or anyone saying that
they're a psychic?

20:34.498 --> 20:36.697
No? No? Why?

20:36.698 --> 20:38.738
No, it's just, erm...

20:43.538 --> 20:46.258
Sorry, can I just look at that?

21:07.098 --> 21:08.898
Do you remember this girl here?

21:10.338 --> 21:12.817
Sadly, yeah.

21:12.818 --> 21:14.538
Stacey Bell.

21:15.578 --> 21:18.897
Everyone's favourite worst nightmare.

21:18.898 --> 21:20.858
She made Jonathan's life hell.

21:22.858 --> 21:24.538
Wicked little cow.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.257
Is this about Stacey?

21:30.258 --> 21:32.457
Erm, why d'you say that?

21:32.458 --> 21:35.737
Cos you know they moved
her back here, yeah?

21:35.738 --> 21:38.297
What, back here on the estate?

21:38.298 --> 21:39.858
I saw her down the shop.

21:40.858 --> 21:44.777
She asked me how I was doing.

21:44.778 --> 21:46.578
I said it was fine.

21:48.938 --> 21:52.217
She said it was a shame
about my brother.

21:52.218 --> 21:54.338
And then she laughed.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.377
No... Are you OK?

22:06.738 --> 22:09.138
It's OK.

22:15.418 --> 22:17.377
Stacey, is it?

22:17.378 --> 22:19.297
It's not, no.

22:19.298 --> 22:22.777
You sure? Because you don't half
remind me of someone I knew.

22:22.778 --> 22:25.017
- Who? Your mum?
- Nah.

22:25.018 --> 22:27.297
No, this little girl I
knew a long way back.

22:27.298 --> 22:30.497
- I often wonder what happened to her.
- Why's that, then?

22:30.498 --> 22:34.377
You like to think about her when you're
having a little play with yourself?

22:34.378 --> 22:38.897
See, that's exactly the sort of thing
she would say, if she was here.

22:38.898 --> 22:41.938
- Except she's not here, is she?
- Apparently not.

25:32.938 --> 25:35.937
'I'm sorry, we can't get
to the phone right now,

25:35.938 --> 25:38.657
'so please leave a
message after the beep.'

25:40.658 --> 25:43.017
'Mum, it's Declan. I
shouldn't be too long,

25:43.018 --> 25:47.018
'I'm just stuck in a bit of traffic,
all right. 'I'll see you soon. Bye.'

27:47.818 --> 27:49.977
- Wotcher.
- George?

27:49.978 --> 27:53.497
All right, John. You
still with us, then?

27:53.498 --> 27:57.137
Er, just about. One of your
boys just had a pop at me.

27:57.138 --> 28:00.097
Well, obviously I don't know what
you're talking about, officer.

28:00.098 --> 28:01.937
But if I did, I'd probably say,

28:01.938 --> 28:04.617
"They wouldn't be my
boys, specifically."

28:04.618 --> 28:07.617
See, if you've been
greenlit, allegedly,

28:07.618 --> 28:10.937
every would be hit man in
London would be after you.

28:10.938 --> 28:13.377
- How was he, by the way?
- Rubbish.

28:13.378 --> 28:14.897
Whoopsie daisy.

28:14.898 --> 28:17.697
- So, how can I help?
- George, just lay off.

28:17.698 --> 28:20.737
I've got a nutjob running
around London eating people

28:20.738 --> 28:23.737
- and I've got a dead kid.
- What do you mean, "Dead kid"?

28:23.738 --> 28:25.537
Yeah. Now, you and me,
we're old school, right?

28:25.538 --> 28:27.657
We're on the same page when
it comes to dead kids.

28:27.658 --> 28:30.577
What's this, Billy Bacon and the
soft-centered Cockney Villain?

28:30.578 --> 28:35.617
Thing is, George, I think this dead
kid is connected to our thing.

28:35.618 --> 28:38.137
Alice Morgan. How?

28:38.138 --> 28:41.177
Like I said, I'm not sure.
But I know it's connected.

28:41.178 --> 28:44.737
- What are we now, psychic?
- Yeah, funny you should say that.

28:44.738 --> 28:48.297
On the basis of this... funny
feeling in your belly,

28:48.298 --> 28:51.377
you are asking for what?
A stay of execution?

28:51.378 --> 28:53.857
They broke the mould after
you popped out, didn't they?

28:53.858 --> 28:55.977
Yeah. That's what my mum used to say.

28:55.978 --> 28:58.017
Your sainted mother.

28:58.018 --> 29:01.152
Is this another appeal to
my maudlin East End heart?

29:01.178 --> 29:02.218
No. Whatever.

29:02.218 --> 29:05.137
Well, I hated my mother, John.

29:05.138 --> 29:07.577
And greenlit is greenlit, I'm afraid.

29:07.578 --> 29:10.897
It's out of my hands.

29:10.898 --> 29:13.337
I'll see you on the
other side of the veil.

29:48.378 --> 29:50.818
Mum? Dad?

30:38.658 --> 30:41.138
Mum? Dad?

30:57.378 --> 30:59.458
Mum?

31:38.738 --> 31:40.898
Was it there?

31:47.418 --> 31:49.098
You ever hear of the...

31:50.298 --> 31:52.018
..confirmation bias?

31:54.138 --> 31:56.738
I beg your pardon? We all do it.

31:58.218 --> 32:02.138
You sort of see things in a way that
support what you already believe.

32:03.858 --> 32:06.097
So, you, erm...

32:06.098 --> 32:08.937
we form an opinion and
then you create a theory

32:08.938 --> 32:11.777
and then you work hard to prove it.
I don't follow.

32:11.778 --> 32:13.738
Yeah. Well, see...

32:14.818 --> 32:17.017
..here's me thinking,

32:17.018 --> 32:20.057
"She must really know a
lot about Alice Morgan.

32:20.058 --> 32:22.937
"I mean, she must know Alice Morgan!"

32:22.938 --> 32:24.537
You know?

32:24.538 --> 32:27.058
"How else would she
know all those details?

32:28.178 --> 32:30.137
"Jonathan Black.

32:30.138 --> 32:32.017
"The toy owl.

32:32.018 --> 32:34.577
"Stacey Bell."

32:34.578 --> 32:37.817
Right? But then the thing is...

32:37.818 --> 32:42.658
No, you don't know Alice Morgan. You
don't know Alice Morgan, at all.

32:44.858 --> 32:47.778
It's Jonathan you know, isn't it?

32:48.898 --> 32:52.418
Jonathan Black and Stacey Bell.

32:55.658 --> 32:57.977
You know them because you
were in their class.

32:57.978 --> 32:59.777
Now, which one's you?

32:59.778 --> 33:02.538
Which one's Sarah Roberts?

33:06.418 --> 33:08.418
So, you do remember.

33:10.138 --> 33:12.218
To be fair, you've changed a lot.

33:14.698 --> 33:16.978
Do you remember the
promise you made me?

33:18.058 --> 33:21.297
She said that she would
kill me if I told anyone.

33:21.298 --> 33:25.817
And I did tell someone. Because you
said that I could trust you. I know.

33:25.818 --> 33:27.618
You promised.

33:28.938 --> 33:31.057
- You did nothing.
- That's not true.

33:31.058 --> 33:33.577
I was ten years old! Too
petrified to sleep.

33:33.578 --> 33:35.867
Do you know what happens to
someone, when they don't sleep?

33:35.892 --> 33:36.970
- To their mind?
- Yeah.

33:37.072 --> 33:38.127
- You do?
- Yeah.

33:38.369 --> 33:39.213
Good.

33:40.313 --> 33:42.697
Because it was your fault.

33:42.698 --> 33:44.258
You lied.

33:46.218 --> 33:48.657
So, that's it?

33:48.658 --> 33:51.697
All this woo-woo bullshit, that's it?
That's it?

33:51.698 --> 33:55.337
This is way of putting all of that
right, because you're petrified -

33:55.338 --> 33:57.738
still petrified of Stacey Bell.

34:00.498 --> 34:02.778
Do you know what it's
like to be haunted?

34:03.858 --> 34:08.177
Megan, that is just your guilt talking, OK.
The dead are gone.

34:08.178 --> 34:13.097
No. The dead aren't even dead, John.

34:13.098 --> 34:15.056
I'm arresting you.

34:15.058 --> 34:19.337
I'm arresting you on suspicion of
perverting the course of justice.

34:19.338 --> 34:22.138
- No, you're not.
- Sorry?

34:23.538 --> 34:25.898
You can't arrest me for anything.

34:31.378 --> 34:33.496
No? And why's that, then?

34:33.498 --> 34:35.697
Because I know what you were planning.

34:36.777 --> 34:40.058
- You and Alice Morgan.
- What's that supposed to mean?

34:41.938 --> 34:44.458
Conspiring to sell uncut diamonds.

34:45.737 --> 34:47.737
Running away with a wanted killer.

34:49.138 --> 34:52.098
What would happen to you, I
wonder, if I were to tell?

34:53.538 --> 34:57.577
Megan, did you break into my house?
Did you take something from me?

34:57.578 --> 34:59.858
- Like what?
- A phone.

35:01.698 --> 35:04.657
How long have you been
listening to me and Alice?

35:04.658 --> 35:06.257
Long enough.

35:06.258 --> 35:08.578
Long enough to know
what happened to her?

35:15.058 --> 35:18.577
Was Alice talking to someone
that I didn't know about?

35:18.578 --> 35:21.338
Someone that, someone
that could hurt her?

35:22.898 --> 35:25.338
Megan... I need to know.

35:26.778 --> 35:29.177
Of course you need to know.

35:29.178 --> 35:31.217
It would be inhuman not to.

35:31.218 --> 35:34.618
I make good on my promise, I make
good on my promise to you...

35:35.898 --> 35:38.898
..then you help me out. All right?

35:41.618 --> 35:44.258
One step at a time, John.

35:59.938 --> 36:02.178
I need to go.

36:08.378 --> 36:10.978
Boss! We're in!

36:20.178 --> 36:22.138
This is some guy, huh?

36:30.818 --> 36:33.337
Right, what we got?

36:33.338 --> 36:37.937
Steven Rose has been keeping
tabs on over two hundred people.

36:37.938 --> 36:39.377
We've been in contact with as many

36:39.378 --> 36:41.217
as possible and advised
them accordingly.

36:41.218 --> 36:43.497
Anything we can use
to get ahead of him?

36:43.498 --> 36:47.497
No contingency plans as such, but
there is a data list of bolt holes,

36:47.498 --> 36:50.377
places all over London
he could hide out in.

36:50.378 --> 36:53.017
Abandoned homes,
schools, swimming pools.

36:53.018 --> 36:55.618
The problem is, that there are
hundreds of them, spread over

36:55.619 --> 36:58.339
six hundred square miles
of Greater London.

36:58.340 --> 37:00.938
- DS Lane, what did you get?
- He lives alone,

37:00.938 --> 37:03.537
has done for about
seven or eight years.

37:03.538 --> 37:07.337
A few girlfriends, nothing serious.
Not since a girl called Katherine.

37:07.338 --> 37:08.318
Katherine who?

37:08.343 --> 37:11.257
Meadows. She and Steven
were students together.

37:11.258 --> 37:14.177
Prototypical first love
thing, back when summers

37:14.178 --> 37:15.777
were endless and whatnot.

37:15.778 --> 37:19.057
She's long since married,
she's now Katherine Woodward.

37:19.058 --> 37:24.297
Other than that, no flatmates,
no hobbies, no real friends...

37:24.298 --> 37:28.457
No life. This, erm, Katherine,
she's definitely not on the list?

37:28.458 --> 37:31.337
Not listed, sir. There is
no Katherines on the list.

37:31.338 --> 37:34.577
- Kates, Katies?
- Nope, she's not there.

37:34.578 --> 37:36.750
Well, we need to talk to her.
Has she got an address?

37:36.937 --> 37:37.766
Er, yeah.

37:42.338 --> 37:45.057
'Police warn that Steven Rose
should be considered dangerous.

37:46.858 --> 37:48.897
'Members of the public
should not approach him,

37:48.898 --> 37:50.682
'but should immediately
contact the police.

37:51.778 --> 37:53.137
'Police are also appealing for

37:53.138 --> 37:54.977
'anybody who might have information...'

37:55.304 --> 37:58.668
- Owen, get the door.
- Who died and made you God?

37:58.738 --> 38:01.617
Sorry, I can't. I'm too
busy having a life.

38:01.618 --> 38:04.852
- Can you get your arse off the sofa?!
- Door!

38:06.898 --> 38:10.377
'These are live pictures coming
to us now of the urgent manhunt

38:10.378 --> 38:13.778
'that is ongoing across the
capital for Steven Rose.

38:15.378 --> 38:18.497
'We will be updating you as
we get the information.'

38:22.018 --> 38:24.778
Katie, did you call this lot?

38:28.018 --> 38:29.977
Steven?

38:29.978 --> 38:32.097
'And I would like to
repeat, police have warned

38:32.098 --> 38:34.697
'Steven Rose should be
considered extremely dangerous.'

39:31.418 --> 39:33.537
The Woodward's are gone, he's got 'em.

39:33.538 --> 39:36.137
Benny, I need you to go through
that list of bolt holes.

39:36.138 --> 39:38.537
Isolate a two-mile
radius from this point.

39:38.538 --> 39:41.978
On its way, boss. Red lights are
properties on the database.

40:08.738 --> 40:10.738
If he wanted to kill her...

40:13.258 --> 40:15.377
..he would have just killed her here.

40:15.378 --> 40:20.018
The fact that he's taken her away,
that tells me that he needs time.

40:20.019 --> 40:22.578
To do what?

40:22.578 --> 40:27.097
I think the thing of it is that he's
come back to get what he's lost.

40:27.098 --> 40:29.377
And the husband? The step-kids?
How does that fit?

40:29.378 --> 40:34.017
Katie loves them. All right?
And that's what Steven does.

40:34.018 --> 40:36.298
He takes from others
what he hasn't got.

40:39.338 --> 40:42.497
What is your knowledge of
crime to journey stats?

40:42.498 --> 40:47.217
Er, stats say that the less familiar
an offender is with a given area,

40:47.218 --> 40:48.987
the closer to home he'll
commit his crimes.

40:49.578 --> 40:51.697
Which puts Steven within
a mile and a half of us.

40:51.698 --> 40:53.697
Yeah, yeah.

40:53.698 --> 40:58.217
That's Benny. I told him to send
you a list of those bolt holes.

40:58.218 --> 41:01.177
OK. So... so, what? We
isolate the properties

41:01.178 --> 41:03.377
- that fall inside that radius?
- No.

41:03.378 --> 41:06.260
Looking for what? Vacant
houses for let or sale?

41:06.285 --> 41:07.377
No, too risky.

41:07.378 --> 41:10.418
- We know he needs time, right?
- Renovations?

41:12.058 --> 41:14.858
No, it's the same problem, isn't it?
Erm...

41:17.218 --> 41:19.498
Boss, there's the old Onslow Hospital.

41:20.898 --> 41:23.217
Yeah, OK.

41:23.218 --> 41:25.657
Erm, OK. So, what do we do?

41:25.658 --> 41:27.897
Well, we should call in armed response.

41:27.898 --> 41:29.498
Yeah. We... we should do that.

41:30.939 --> 41:33.379
Except last time we did
that he got away...

41:34.858 --> 41:37.257
So, what do we do?

41:37.258 --> 41:39.618
- We do it right.
- Good answer.

42:27.418 --> 42:29.098
Please, don't.

42:32.058 --> 42:35.017
Please.

43:59.338 --> 44:01.177
Steven. Please, don't.

44:01.178 --> 44:02.817
I want you back.

44:05.258 --> 44:08.498
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

44:34.418 --> 44:36.418
Hey, wait.

45:22.498 --> 45:24.338
Emma?

45:32.698 --> 45:34.857
Run!

46:21.059 --> 46:23.258
Are you Owen Woodward?

46:23.258 --> 46:24.818
Are you hurt?

46:26.338 --> 46:28.497
Where is he?

46:28.498 --> 46:30.257
Who else is he with?

46:30.258 --> 46:32.417
My family.

46:32.418 --> 46:35.217
OK. OK. You need to get out.

46:35.218 --> 46:37.817
OK. It's going to be OK.

46:37.818 --> 46:39.938
Quietly. It's going to be OK.

47:58.658 --> 48:01.297
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Steven!
Stop! Stop! Just stop!

48:01.298 --> 48:02.977
Just stop!

48:02.978 --> 48:05.978
Stop. Stop.

48:07.938 --> 48:11.177
You lost her, mate. OK? She's gone.

48:11.178 --> 48:15.257
She's gone. All right? But this
thing that you're feeling,

48:15.258 --> 48:18.457
this thing, it's in your head,
it's a physical thing, you know.

48:18.458 --> 48:21.137
It can be put right.

48:21.138 --> 48:25.458
- I died.
- No, no. The dead don't come back, OK?

48:26.938 --> 48:30.458
Now, we think they do, but they don't.

48:35.978 --> 48:37.417
Steven!

48:37.418 --> 48:39.258
Don't! Stop! Stop!

48:56.898 --> 48:59.138
Emma...

49:00.538 --> 49:02.657
Emma.

49:02.658 --> 49:05.138
Put it down. Put it down.

49:39.978 --> 49:41.858
We got to talk about that gun.

49:43.538 --> 49:46.978
- Yeah, I should have told you I took it.
- Yeah, you should have.

49:53.298 --> 49:55.298
You found it, all right?

49:56.498 --> 49:58.658
It was Steven's gun and you found it.

50:03.458 --> 50:04.978
It'll be all right.

50:06.978 --> 50:09.138
It was a good shooting.

50:29.418 --> 50:30.897
Hey, Ben.

50:30.898 --> 50:33.377
Good work, Dirty Harriet.

50:33.378 --> 50:35.497
Boss, can I have a word?

50:35.498 --> 50:37.498
Yeah.

50:39.738 --> 50:41.817
It's about that other thing.

50:41.818 --> 50:44.577
I've been having a nosey around

50:44.578 --> 50:47.737
Megan Cantor's financials.

50:47.738 --> 50:50.697
Now, there's nothing massively
out of the ordinary,

50:50.698 --> 50:52.857
but there is something,
it might be nothing.

50:52.858 --> 50:56.898
Not everything's something. She does
pay rental on a safe deposit box.

52:21.538 --> 52:22.978
Nice hat.

52:24.538 --> 52:27.138
Nice coat. Very sensible.

52:29.938 --> 52:33.618
- We find ourselves in a pickle.
- We are. We're in a pickle.

52:36.658 --> 52:38.418
What if I found a way to fix it?

52:39.418 --> 52:43.057
For you to save some face
and make some money?

52:43.058 --> 52:45.137
Quite a bit of money.

52:45.138 --> 52:47.177
Well, as it happens, I often find

52:47.178 --> 52:50.618
that money has an elevating
effect on my frame of mind.

52:53.858 --> 52:56.497
There. That's what you wanted.

52:56.498 --> 52:58.605
That's what you tried
to steal from Alice.

52:58.630 --> 53:02.137
Well, it seems a bit unseemly
when you put it like that...

53:02.138 --> 53:04.097
but, yeah, that's the gist of it.

53:04.098 --> 53:05.617
Where'd you find them, by the way?

53:05.618 --> 53:07.937
Inside the body, were they?
What, she swallow them?

53:07.938 --> 53:09.457
Do you want them, or what?

53:09.458 --> 53:13.577
Are we being serious, now? You
do know what this lot is worth?

53:13.578 --> 53:15.657
Yeah.

53:15.658 --> 53:17.658
Enough to start a new life.

53:18.978 --> 53:21.457
But that's not going
to happen now, is it?

53:21.458 --> 53:23.458
What am I going to buy with these?

53:39.218 --> 53:41.217
Shame she died.

53:41.218 --> 53:42.978
You ever find out who did it?

53:44.338 --> 53:46.338
Look, you've got your money now.

53:48.138 --> 53:50.257
What are the chances of
you me doing a favour?

53:50.258 --> 53:52.898
Here we go, then. What do you want?

53:54.138 --> 53:58.697
Cocaine, heroin, pills...
whatever's lying about.

53:58.698 --> 54:02.138
Well, that's an unusual request.
I mean, given the day job.

54:04.018 --> 54:06.658
It's been an unusual
couple of days, George.

54:10.178 --> 54:11.938
Yeah.

54:53.538 --> 54:57.617
And where did you come
across this information?

54:57.618 --> 55:00.137
A tip.

55:00.138 --> 55:02.377
From...?

55:02.378 --> 55:05.017
A source.

55:05.018 --> 55:07.098
A source.

55:08.258 --> 55:10.657
And this puts it to bed?

55:10.658 --> 55:12.537
For good?

55:12.538 --> 55:14.258
Yeah.

55:15.898 --> 55:17.938
Will there be anything else?

55:18.978 --> 55:21.498
No, boss. Thank you.

55:30.938 --> 55:32.858
Get off of me!

55:35.058 --> 55:37.218
Ow!

55:43.338 --> 55:46.377
They'll do her for intent to supply
and then they'll upgrade to murder

55:46.378 --> 55:48.577
when they connect the toy to Jonathan.

55:56.138 --> 55:58.218
Do you feel better putting it right?

56:01.458 --> 56:03.057
Did you hurt her?

56:03.058 --> 56:04.658
Who?

56:06.938 --> 56:08.378
Alice.

56:09.378 --> 56:11.018
Did you?

56:12.538 --> 56:14.377
Why would I?

56:14.378 --> 56:17.737
Because you wanted me
to keep my promise.

56:17.738 --> 56:20.017
You had to stop me from leaving.

56:20.018 --> 56:21.697
Hmm.

56:21.698 --> 56:24.138
It could be that.

56:25.298 --> 56:30.457
Or perhaps it could be
that Alice Morgan...

56:30.458 --> 56:33.537
was your blind spot.

56:33.538 --> 56:36.658
You didn't love her, not really.

56:38.338 --> 56:41.538
She frightened you and
she excited you...

56:42.738 --> 56:44.658
..and you mistook that for love.

56:48.818 --> 56:51.897
But you would have
killed her, eventually.

56:51.898 --> 56:53.618
If she didn't kill you first.

56:56.618 --> 56:58.778
Perhaps that's why I did it.

57:09.018 --> 57:10.817
But I didn't.

57:10.818 --> 57:13.617
Megan...

57:13.618 --> 57:15.578
..are you scared of me?

57:18.018 --> 57:19.818
Clearly not.

57:22.298 --> 57:24.577
Well, you should be.

57:24.578 --> 57:26.298
Because I'm coming for you.
