12:54.106 --> 12:57.492
  BUT I WOULDN'T HIRE HER TO BE 
  THE FIRST FACE PEOPLE SEE WHEN
  THEY COME TO MY BUSINESS.     

12:57.526 --> 12:59.794
        - DON'T BE MEAN.        
        - I'M SORRY.            

12:59.829 --> 13:02.964

I DON'T WANT TO SIT SOMEWHERE   
WHERE ONE OF YOUR OTHER GIRLS   
HAS "VISITED" YOU.              

13:29.658 --> 13:31.993

      I DON'T DO THAT.          
    - NEVER?                    

13:32.027 --> 13:33.528
          NO!

14:02.224 --> 14:04.859
  - WHAT DID YOU THINK, DRAMA?  
  - I THOUGHT SHE SUCKED.       

14:04.894 --> 14:07.312
  - I THOUGHT THEY ALL SUCKED.  
  - ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN.       

14:07.363 --> 14:09.063
     WHERE ARE WE GETTING       
THESE GIRLS FROM ANYWAY?        

14:09.097 --> 14:12.483
- WE PUT A CALL OUT TO ALL      
  THE MODELING AGENCIES.        
- MODELS?!                      

14:12.535 --> 14:15.320
  - THAT'S WHAT                 
    THIS WAS-- A MODEL SEARCH?  
  - THE NETWORK WANTS A MODEL.  

14:15.371 --> 14:17.071
            AM I THE ONLY ONE   
            WHO WAS HORRIFIED?  

14:17.105 --> 14:19.607
        I HAD ZERO CHEMISTRY    
        WITH THESE "MODELS."    

14:19.625 --> 14:22.493
        DO YOU KNOW WHY?        
        BECAUSE THEY COULD BE   
        OUT-ACTED BY LINT.      

14:22.545 --> 14:24.278
      - BUT THEY'RE SEXY.       
      - <i>SO WHAT?</i>                

14:24.296 --> 14:27.298
 I MADE OUT WITH 15 OF THEM--   
    NOT ONE OF THEM MADE ME     
          DRAW WOOD.            

14:27.333 --> 14:30.285
         YOU KNOW WHY?          
BECAUSE I'M ATTRACTED TO TALENT.

14:31.754 --> 14:34.088
      MAYBE THE STORYLINE       
      JUST ISN'T WORKING.       

14:34.122 --> 14:35.590
             WHAT?              
     NO NO, TIMMY, TIMMY,       

14:35.624 --> 14:38.259
        IT WORKS GREAT.         
    WE JUST GOTTA GET           
    A REAL ACTRESS IN HERE.     

14:38.293 --> 14:40.562
    - I'LL CALL EDDIE BURNS.    
    - NO NO NO,                 

14:40.596 --> 14:42.847
          I'LL CALL EDDIE BURNS.
          IN FACT,              

14:42.898 --> 14:45.300
      I'LL GO VISIT EDDIE BURNS,
      FACE TO FACE.             

14:47.803 --> 14:49.904
             Andrew:            
             <i>NO, YOU MADE ALL</i>   
             <i>THE RIGHT MOVES.</i>   

14:49.939 --> 14:51.906
        I KNOW THAT YOU LOVE    
        THE DIRECTING THING,    

14:51.941 --> 14:53.841
        I KNOW YOU LOVE DOING   
        THE THEATER THING,      

14:53.876 --> 14:56.110
BUT I THINK THAT                
THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME          

14:56.145 --> 14:59.614
    - TO GET BACK INTO TV.      
    - LOOK, I'M NOT TOTALLY     
      RULING IT OUT.            

14:59.648 --> 15:01.950
    IT'S JUST IF I'M GOING      
     TO DO ANOTHER SERIES,      

15:01.984 --> 15:05.086
IT'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING FRESH,  
    IT'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING     
        ORIGINAL.               

15:05.120 --> 15:07.338
  AND THE STUFF I'M HEARING,    
     I'M JUST NOT LOVING.       

15:07.339 --> 15:10.608
    NO WORRIES.  WE'LL JUST KEEP
    TELLING YOU STUFF UNTIL YOU 
    HEAR SOMETHING YOU LOV U    

15:10.643 --> 15:12.644
OKAY, LET'S GO. I'M HEARING,    
TRISH, WHAT DO YOU GOT?G.       

15:12.678 --> 15:16.247
            "OUT THERE."        
            IT'S A TRADITIONAL  
            FAMILY SITCOM.      

15:16.282 --> 15:19.367
          YOU'D PLAY A NEUROTIC 
          FUNNY DAD WHO CAPTAINS
          HIS ENTIRE FAMILY     

15:19.401 --> 15:21.469
      - ON A CRUISE             
        AROUND THE WORLD.       
      - ( laughs )              

15:21.503 --> 15:24.038
WOW, SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE       
"RAYMOND" MEETS "THE LOVE BOAT."

15:24.073 --> 15:25.473
          - YES!                
          - <i>OH, COOL.</i>           

15:25.507 --> 15:28.376
    OR I JUST SHOOT MYSELF      
IN THE FUCKING FACE RIGHT NOW.  

15:28.410 --> 15:31.963
    DON'T YOU DARE TOUCH        
    THAT PUNIM, DAVID SCHWIMMER,
    MY FAVORITE "FRIEND."       

15:31.997 --> 15:34.649
     WOW, THIS IS A FIRST.      
  REMEMBER WHEN I SIGNED HERE   

15:34.683 --> 15:37.068

      BE IN ALL MY MEETINGS?    
    - YEAH.                     

15:37.119 --> 15:39.320
     - THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.     
     - WHAT ELSE WE GOT?        

15:39.355 --> 15:41.422
    - RAJ, WHAT DO YOU GOT?     
    - "NEUROSIS."               

15:41.457 --> 15:44.626
IT'S ABOUT A NEUROTIC GUY       
WHO IS ALLERGIC TO EVERYTHING.  

15:44.660 --> 15:46.461
 <i>IT'S REALLY FUNNY.</i>             

15:48.797 --> 15:52.433
THEY WANT PAMELA ANDERSON       
FOR THE HOT NEIGHBOR            
WITH A CAT...                   

15:52.468 --> 15:54.085
WHO MAY OR MAY NOT TALK.        

15:56.055 --> 15:58.089
    - DO YOU GUYS VALIDATE?     
    - ( laughter )              

15:58.140 --> 16:00.174
            NO.                 
            ALL RIGHT, LIZZIE,  
            GO AHEAD.           

16:00.209 --> 16:03.311
PERSONALLY, DAVID,              
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU         
DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.         

16:03.345 --> 16:07.632
WE ALL KNOW YOU CAN             
PLAY NEUROTIC, BUT YOU'RE       
KIND OF THIS BIG STRAPPING GUY. 

16:08.784 --> 16:11.686
"GUYS IN BLUE."                 
IT'S A DETECTIVE SHOW,          

16:11.720 --> 16:13.404
 <i>BUT IT'S HALF HOUR</i>             
 <i>SINGLE-CAMERA.</i>                 

16:13.439 --> 16:17.558
IT'S A COMEDY WITH EDGE         
AND YOU WOULDN'T BE             
THE PUSHOVER.                   

16:17.576 --> 16:20.078
    IN FACT, YOU WOULD          
    KIND OF BE THE JERK.        

16:20.112 --> 16:23.448
BUT IT'S REALLY FUNNY           
AND IT HAS A LOT MORE HEART     
THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT.          

16:25.167 --> 16:27.001
- WE HAVEN'T MET YET, HAVE WE?  
- NO.  HI.

16:33.809 --> 16:36.210
        OH, RIGHT RIGHT!        
        YOU'RE FROM CHICAGO.    

16:36.245 --> 16:37.945

16:37.980 --> 16:40.298
     - COME ON, SERIOUSLY?      
     - <i>YEAH.</i>                    

16:40.332 --> 16:43.368
YOU ACTUALLY GAVE               
THE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH         
AT MY GRADUATION.               

16:43.402 --> 16:46.187
     - IT WAS REALLY GOOD.      
     - OH, THANK YOU.           

16:46.221 --> 16:47.889
            I... I WORKED       
            REALLY HARD ON THAT.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.757
      OF COURSE YOU DID.        
    YOU'RE DAVID SCHWIMMER.     

16:49.792 --> 16:52.944
- <i>YOU WORK HARD ON EVERYTHING.</i>  
- I DIDN'T PICTURE YOU LIKE THIS
  FROM YOUR VOICE.              

16:52.978 --> 16:57.115
- YEAH, I GET THAT A LOT.       
- NO, I MEAN, NOT THAT YOU HAVE 
  A WEIRD VOICE.                

16:57.149 --> 16:59.951
        IT'S JUST... I MEAN,    
        YOU HAVE A LOVELY VOICE.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.653
    OH, THANK YOU.              

17:05.624 --> 17:09.493
     - WELL, THIS IS            
       OFFICIALLY AWKWARD.      
     - ( all laugh )            

17:09.528 --> 17:11.194
        YOU KNOW WHAT,          
         ANDREW, ARI?           

17:11.230 --> 17:15.049
    I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL     
 OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR IDEAS,   

17:15.084 --> 17:18.319
     ESPECIALLY YOU, RAJ,       
  BUT I THINK LIZZIE REALLY--   

17:18.353 --> 17:20.588
            REALLY IS GETTING   
            WHAT I'M GOING FOR, 

17:20.622 --> 17:22.740
            SO WHY DON'T WE     
            JUST BREAK THIS UP? 

17:22.775 --> 17:24.909
      AND, LIZZIE, WHY DON'T    
      YOU AND I GRAB SOME LUNCH,

17:24.943 --> 17:26.560
  - <i>TALK ABOUT IT SOME MORE?</i>    
  - UH...                       

17:26.595 --> 17:28.563
     THAT IS A GREAT IDEA.      
 YOU GUYS GO GRAB SOME LUNCH--  

17:28.597 --> 17:32.133
  - I DON'T KNOW WHY            
    THEY JUST CAN'T STAY HERE.  
  - BECAUSE I'M STARVING        

17:32.151 --> 17:35.520
      - AND YOU'RE BORING.      
      - ( all laugh )           

17:35.554 --> 17:38.606
  - LIZZIE, WHY DON'T WE TAKE   
    A DRIVE TO THE BEACH?       
  - YEAH, SOUNDS GREAT.         

17:38.640 --> 17:40.958
  - YOU GUYS ENJOY YOURSELVES.

      HI, I CAN'T BELIEVE

    - WHAT KIND                 
      OF NAME IS KANARCHY?      
    - THAT'S HER LAST NAME.     

17:50.619 --> 17:53.287
- NO, IT'S KANARCHY LEWIS.      
- I HAVE NO IDEA.               

17:53.321 --> 17:54.872
      - THIS IS AWFUL.          
      - TELL ME ABOUT IT.       

17:54.923 --> 17:57.091
        I'VE READ               
        10 SCRIPTS THIS WEEK.   
        THEY'RE ALL AWFUL.      

17:57.126 --> 17:59.927
GOOD THING YOU HAVE VINCE.      
YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE           
TO READ ANY OF THESE.           

17:59.962 --> 18:01.846
      - ( knocks )              
      - Jane: <i>MR. MURPHY?</i>       

18:01.880 --> 18:04.265
    - YEAH?                     
    - UH-- OH, IT'S LOCKED.     

18:04.299 --> 18:05.683
              WELL, I'M WORKING!
              WHAT'S UP?        

18:05.717 --> 18:08.636
DON'T YELL AT HER.              
YOU'LL GIVE HER A HEART ATTACK. 

18:08.670 --> 18:10.938
VINCE IS ON THE PHONE.          
HE INSISTS ON TALKING TO YOU.   

18:10.973 --> 18:13.391
 UH... OKAY, PUT HIM THROUGH.   

18:13.442 --> 18:15.643
    - ( phone beeps )           
    - HELLO!                    

18:15.677 --> 18:19.013
  - HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?    
  - I'M WORKING.  WHAT DO YOU   
    THINK I'M DOING?            

18:19.031 --> 18:21.232
  - <i>Jane said Ashley's there.</i>   
  - SO?                         

18:21.283 --> 18:22.950
            UH-HUH.             
        NOTHING.                

18:22.985 --> 18:24.986
HEY, HOW COME YOU'RE NOT        
    ON THIS FACEBOOK THING?     

18:25.020 --> 18:28.623
  - UH, BECAUSE I'M AN ADULT.   
    HOW COME YOU ARE?           
  - <i>Nikki showed it to me.</i>      

18:28.657 --> 18:31.592
      I SET UP MY PROFILE       
     AND I ALREADY GOT 74       
    FRIEND REQUESTS.            

18:31.627 --> 18:34.028
 - <i>Jesus.</i>                       
 - YEAH IT'S KIND OF AMAZING.   

18:34.046 --> 18:37.331
    - YOU REMEMBER              
      KIMBERLY KIRSCH?          
    - NO.                       

18:37.365 --> 18:40.418
      YEAH, NEITHER DO I,       
BUT APPARENTLY I WAS HER        
  FIRST KISS IN FIFTH GRADE.    

18:40.469 --> 18:42.553
SHE'S GOT FOUR KIDS NOW,        
BUT SHE STILL LOOKS HOT.        

18:42.588 --> 18:45.039
    - OKAY, HAVE FUN.           
    - <i>Hey-- you think</i>           
     <i> it's a bad idea</i>           

18:45.057 --> 18:46.974
       <i>if I invite one of</i>       
      <i>my new friends over?</i>      

18:47.009 --> 18:48.759
     - OH, SHUT UP!             
     - <i>She's really cute--</i>      

18:48.811 --> 18:51.229
     COLLEGE GRAD, LOTS OF      
 RESPECTABLE-LOOKING FRIENDS,   

18:51.263 --> 18:53.380
        ALL OF WHOM SAY         
  VERY NICE THINGS ABOUT HER.   

18:53.398 --> 18:56.234
    - VINCE, PLEASE             
      DON'T GET KILLED!         
    - <i>I'm playing with you.</i>     

18:56.268 --> 18:59.253
            OKAY.  ARE YOU GOOD?
            BECAUSE I SHOULD GET
            BACK TO WORK.       

18:59.288 --> 19:01.906
         E, I'M GREAT.          
  AND YOU SHOULD LIGHTEN UP.    
         LIFE'S GOOD.           

19:01.940 --> 19:03.925
  - JUST LOOK OVER AT ASHLEY.   
  - ( chuckles )                

19:03.959 --> 19:06.828
- ALL RIGHT,                    
  I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.       
- <i>Later.</i>                        

19:06.862 --> 19:08.830
    - EVERYTHING OKAY?          
    - HE'S HAPPY.               

19:08.864 --> 19:10.698
             HE FOUND FACEBOOK. 

19:10.732 --> 19:12.633
     - AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?      
     - RIGHT NOW I AM.          

19:12.668 --> 19:16.403
  - I'M GLAD I COULD HELP.      
  - MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE THIS   
    A DAILY OCCURRENCE.         

19:16.421 --> 19:19.607
IF WE MADE THIS                 
A DAILY OCCURRENCE,             
I'D BE WORKING AT J CREW        

19:19.641 --> 19:21.759
AND YOU'D BE MANAGING           
THE BIGGEST LOSER.              

19:21.793 --> 19:24.295
 - WELL, AT LEAST HE'S WORKING. 
 - WHAT'S WRONG?                

19:24.329 --> 19:27.181
        EH, NOTHING.            
        I JUST REALLY DON'T KNOW
        WHAT I'M DOING HERE.    

19:27.216 --> 19:29.050
            WHAT DO YOU MEAN?   
            I DON'T UNDERSTAND. 

19:29.084 --> 19:32.603
I MEAN THAT I COME HERE         
EVERY DAY SO I FEEL LIKE        
I HAVE PURPOSE,                 

19:32.638 --> 19:35.489
BUT THE TRUTH IS LAST YEAR      
VINCE'S CAREER EXPLODED         

19:35.524 --> 19:37.458
AND THE REST OF MY BUSINESS     
IMPLODED.                       

19:37.492 --> 19:41.145
- BUT YOU HAVE VINCE.           
- YEAH, BUT WHAT DO I HAVE      
  HERE IN THIS OFFICE?          

19:41.196 --> 19:43.664
            - JANE?             
            - YEAH.             

19:43.699 --> 19:46.567
YOU KNOW, I NEVER               
REALLY KNEW HOW TO MAKE         
THIS A REAL BUSINESS.           

19:46.602 --> 19:48.653
I WAS ALWAYS GOOD               
AT HELPING VINCE MOVE FORWARD,  

19:48.704 --> 19:50.655
NOT VERY GOOD AT HELPING        
MYSELF MOVE FORWARD.            

19:50.706 --> 19:54.709
  BUT, ERIC, YOU HAVE VINCE!    
  DO YOU KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE?

19:54.743 --> 19:59.013
        TWO YEARS AGO I WAS     
        MANAGING A GROCERY STORE
        TO PAY MY BILLS.        

19:59.047 --> 20:01.983
    AND YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM    
    THAT MOST PEOPLE SUFFER FOR.

20:02.017 --> 20:04.185
     DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. 

20:05.137 --> 20:06.620
            YEAH...             

20:06.638 --> 20:09.740
        SO?                     
        WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT?

20:11.459 --> 20:13.928
I DON'T KNOW.                   

20:13.962 --> 20:16.597
          HEY, BUDDY,           
     HOW'D YOUR LUNCH GO?       

20:16.632 --> 20:19.350
    IT WAS GOING GREAT TILL     
 YOUR NEW TV HEAD CRASHED IT.   

20:19.401 --> 20:21.435
     - <i>What?</i>                    
     - YEAH, WHAT A FREAK.      

20:21.470 --> 20:24.005
 - WE WERE HAVING               
   SUCH A GOOD TIME.            
 - I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, DAVID. 

20:24.039 --> 20:27.191
 - I'M SURE HE WAS JUST FEELING 
   PROTECTIVE OF A YOUNG AGENT. 
 - <i>Bullshit.</i>                    

20:27.242 --> 20:30.144
    HE'S EITHER FUCKING HER     
      OR HE'S TRYING TO.        

20:30.162 --> 20:31.662
      - ISN'T HE MARRIED?       
      - YES!                    

20:31.697 --> 20:33.414
         <i>Well, someone</i>          
     <i>should tell him.</i>           

20:33.448 --> 20:36.367
      ANYWAY, I LIKE HER        
     AND I LIKE THE IDEA.       
  WE SHOULD SET UP A MEETING.   

20:36.418 --> 20:39.303
     - YOU GOT IT, MAN.         
     - AND, YOU KNOW, ARI,      
       I'M REALLY PISSED.       

20:39.338 --> 20:42.757
  I COULDN'T EVEN EAT DESSERT   
KNOWING I WASN'T GOING TO       
     FUCK THAT GIRL TODAY.      

20:42.791 --> 20:44.959
        I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.   
        I'LL SEE YOU, DAVID.    

20:44.993 --> 20:47.211
     - MR. GOLD, MR. GOLD!      
     - WHAT WHAT?!              

20:47.246 --> 20:49.497
I THINK SOMETHING STRANGE IS    
HAPPENING WITH ANDREW KLEIN.    

20:49.531 --> 20:52.183
- WHY?                          
- BECAUSE HE'S SITTING IN       
  HIS CAR IN THE PARKING GARAGE.

20:52.217 --> 20:54.552
      - DOING WHAT?             
      - HIS BACK WAS TO ME      

20:54.603 --> 20:57.438
SO I CAN'T BE SURE,             
BUT HE SEEMED TO BE...          
WEEPING.                        

20:58.840 --> 21:00.658
 - GO LOSE MORE WEIGHT, LLOYD.  
 - WHAT?                        

21:00.692 --> 21:02.860
          GO LOSE MORE WEIGHT.  
          NOW!                  

21:22.381 --> 21:24.215
         WHAT THE FUCK          
        ARE YOU DOING?          

21:24.249 --> 21:25.866
             PLEASE PLEASE,     
             DON'T BE MAD AT ME.

21:25.884 --> 21:28.002
    - DON'T BE MAD AT YOU?      
    - I'M HAVING A MELTDOWN.    

21:28.036 --> 21:29.804
        ARE YOU MY FRIEND?      

21:29.838 --> 21:31.973
        I MEAN, I'M HAVING      
        A MELTDOWN.             

21:32.007 --> 21:35.142
YOU'RE MELTING ME DOWN,         
BOTH PERSONALLY AND AT WORK.    

21:35.177 --> 21:37.144
      - NO.  NO, I'M NOT.       
      - YOU'RE NOT?             

21:37.179 --> 21:39.847
YOU DIDN'T BUST IN              
ON THE DAVID SCHWIMMER LUNCH?   

21:39.881 --> 21:42.216
             YES, AND SCHWIMMER 
             IS DOING THE SHOW! 

21:42.234 --> 21:44.935
- HE'S DOING IT, ARI!           
- HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO TV?

21:44.987 --> 21:48.155
    YEAH YEAH, BUT I COULDN'T   
    JUST LET HIM FUCK HER.      
    YES, HE'S DOING TV.         

21:48.190 --> 21:50.557
             AND-- AND SORKIN   
             IS COMING IN.      

21:50.575 --> 21:52.443
            OKAY?               
            HE'S RIGHT THERE.   

21:52.494 --> 21:55.579
      - ARE YOU KIDDING?        
      - NO, I'M KILLING IT      
        FOR YOU AT WORK!        

21:55.614 --> 21:57.581
         - YOU KNOW--           
          - ( honks )           

21:57.616 --> 21:59.700
                     SHIT.      

21:59.734 --> 22:01.836
     AND I TRIED TO KEEP MY WIFE
     AWAY FROM YOUR WIFE.       

22:01.870 --> 22:04.872
  - I DIDN'T MEAN               
    FOR ANY OF THIS TO HAPPEN.  
  - YOU SAID THAT IT WAS OVER.  

22:04.906 --> 22:06.757
            I THOUGHT IT WAS,   
            BUT LOOK AT ME!     

22:06.792 --> 22:08.909
            LOOK...             

22:08.927 --> 22:12.013
      CAN YOU JUST BE MY FRIEND?
      TELL ME WHAT TO DO.       
      ( sniffles )              

22:16.101 --> 22:18.886
THINK ABOUT YOUR KIDS.          

22:18.920 --> 22:21.255
THINK ABOUT                     
HOW YOU WANT THEM               

22:21.273 --> 22:23.107
TO THINK ABOUT THEIR DAD.       

22:23.141 --> 22:26.977
DO YOU WANT THEM TO THINK       
THAT YOU SPENT YOUR LIFE        
AS A LIAR?                      

22:34.953 --> 22:37.872
  - I'M TELLING YOU,            
    THEY WERE BUSH LEAGUERS.    
  - DRAMA, PLEASE, CALM DOWN.   

22:37.906 --> 22:40.441
IF YOU WERE THERE,              
YOU'D BE FREAKING OUT TOO.      
IT WAS AWFUL.                   

22:40.459 --> 22:43.677
     OH REALLY?  BECAUSE MY WIFE
     IS FRIENDS WITH ONE OF     
     THE GIRLS THAT CAME IN--   

22:43.712 --> 22:46.914
      STACY-- SHE SAID YOU      
      MADE HER DO 25 TAKES, MAN.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.717
WELL, I GAVE THEM ALL           
A FAIR LOOK.                    

22:49.751 --> 22:52.119
    LOOK, I'M TRYING TO MAKE    
    A MOVIE HERE, ALL RIGHT?    

22:52.154 --> 22:54.655
EDDIE, I KNOW YOU'VE MOVED ON   
FROM OUR LITTLE TV EFFORT,      

22:54.689 --> 22:57.058
AND ARE CONTENT TO JUST         
RECEIVE A NO-SHOW PAYCHECK,     

22:57.092 --> 23:00.294
BUT I'M STILL HERE, TRYING      
TO MAKE SURE THOSE PAYCHECKS    
KEEP COMING IN FOR YOU.         

23:00.312 --> 23:02.913
    AND I APPRECIATE THAT.      
     BUT THIS THING SHOOTS      
          ON THURSDAY           

23:02.948 --> 23:04.815
         AND WE GOTTA           
LOCK SOMEBODY DOWN, MAN.        

23:04.850 --> 23:07.234
 - DO ANOTHER CASTING SESSION.  
 - THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME.     

23:07.269 --> 23:09.236
LET'S MAKE AN OFFER OUT         
TO SOME KNOWN ACTRESSES.        

23:09.271 --> 23:11.405
 - A KNOWN ACTRESS?  LIKE WHO?  
 - NATALIE PORTMAN.             

23:11.440 --> 23:13.774
    GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.   
    YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GETHERE.

23:13.808 --> 23:16.327
  - RACHEL McADAMS.             
  - DUDE, YOU ARE CLEARLY LOST  

23:16.361 --> 23:18.562
          IN ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR
          DELUSIONAL DAYDREAMS. 

23:18.597 --> 23:21.966
IT'S ONE SCENE IN ONE EPISODE   
OF A MIDDLING NBC DRAMA.        

23:22.000 --> 23:26.420
     LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT WE'RE 
     NOT GOING TO GET A BIG-NAME
     ACTRESS FOR THAT PART.     

23:28.490 --> 23:31.342
  - COME ON, TURTLE, HURRY UP.  
  - I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.          

23:31.376 --> 23:33.461
    - ABSOLUTELY NOT!           
    - WHY?                      

23:33.495 --> 23:35.513
FOR SO MANY REASONS.            
THE FIRST ONE BEING             

23:35.547 --> 23:38.349
  - I DON'T WANT YOUR TONGUE    
    IN MY GIRLFRIEND'S MOUTH.   
  - IT'S JUST ACTING!           

23:38.383 --> 23:41.552
I KNOW WHERE YOUR TONGUE'S BEEN

     - WHY, WHAT'D YOU DO?      

25:29.544 --> 25:32.213

      HE LOOKS NICE?

        WHO KNEW                
        YOU COULD FIND STYLE    
        IN THE HUSKY SECTION?

26:31.139 --> 26:33.974
 AND BELIEVE ME, I COULD TELL   
  IT WAS A STRUGGLE FOR HIM.    

26:34.009 --> 26:36.110
  - YOU ASKED HER?              
  - IT'LL HELP YOU OUT, RIGHT?  

26:36.144 --> 26:39.513
     YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH.

    BUT IT'S NETWORK SO IT'S    
    NOT GONNA BE TOO GRAPHIC.   

26:49.291 --> 26:52.042
- THERE'S A SEX SCENE NOW?      
- I'M KIDDING!

      I NEED A BEER.            
    - YES, NOW.                 

27:02.771 --> 27:04.738
            - YO.

         <i>WHAT'S WRONG?</i>          

27:07.108 --> 27:10.027
      - AH, I'M SHUTTING        
        DOWN THE BUSINESS.      
      - THE MURPHY GROUP?       

27:10.061 --> 27:12.997
      - <i>YEP.</i>                    
      - IT WASN'T MUCH          
        OF A GROUP ANYWAY.      

27:13.031 --> 27:14.932
    COME ON, JOHNNY.            
    WHY, WHAT HAPPENED?         

27:14.966 --> 27:18.469
THE ONLY REASON I EVER OPENED   
THE OFFICE IN THE FIRST PLACE   
WAS BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK      

27:18.503 --> 27:20.821
IT'D LOOK GOOD HAVING A GUY     
MANAGE YOU FROM HIS KITCHEN.    

27:20.855 --> 27:24.274
  MY FIRST MANAGER              
  DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A KITCHEN--  
  A SMALL STUDIO AND A HOTPLATE.

27:24.326 --> 27:27.244
  - ( chuckles )                
  - E, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.  
    IF YOU'RE HAPPY--           

27:27.278 --> 27:30.280
 - WELL, I'M NOT.               
 - IS THIS CAUSE WE WERE MAKING 
   FUN OF YOU THIS MORNING?     

27:30.315 --> 27:33.000
    - WE WERE JUST KIDDING.     
    - NO, IT'S GOT NOTHING      
      TO DO WITH THAT.          

27:33.034 --> 27:34.735
THE OFFICE IS A JOKE.           
I'M OKAY WITH IT.               

27:34.753 --> 27:36.754
        GREAT!                  
        SO SIT BACK AND ENJOY   
        SOME TIME OFF.          

27:36.788 --> 27:39.289
        I GOTTA SAY,            
        A LITTLE HIATUS         
        DOES A BODY GOOD.
