-Otis!

02:37.800 --> 02:39.600
Oh, I'm sorry! Ah!

02:39.680 --> 02:41.880
-What?
-Fuck! Stop!

02:44.880 --> 02:46.680
I forgot my wallet.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.440
-What happened yesterday...
-Mum.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.640
...is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.

03:15.240 --> 03:18.560
Masturbating is normal and healthy,

03:19.120 --> 03:23.320
and I am so proud that you are at
this stage of your pubescent development.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.760
Okay, great.
Can we please not talk about it?

03:28.760 --> 03:32.800
However, there is a time
and a place for such a...

03:33.600 --> 03:35.360
-private activity.
-Mum!

03:35.440 --> 03:38.880
And I'm not sure the car,
it being a shared space,

03:38.960 --> 03:43.400
is the most appropriate choice
for such an event to occur.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.760
Understood.

03:47.120 --> 03:51.520
Revealing one's genitalia in public
is also a criminal offense.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.000
I will not do it again.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.480
I promise.

03:56.280 --> 04:00.840
Also, I've noticed you've been taking
very long showers lately.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.600
Now, I know that the bathroom is a...

04:04.240 --> 04:08.200
safe environment
in which to enjoy oneself,

04:08.280 --> 04:09.640
but I live here too,

04:10.040 --> 04:11.800
and I also need hot water.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.800
So if you could please...

04:14.360 --> 04:15.560
keep that in mind.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.840
-Will do.
-Isn't it wonderful,

04:19.920 --> 04:23.880
how we've been talking so much more openly
and honestly lately?

04:24.960 --> 04:27.080
-I have got to go.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.440
Bye, darling.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.680
Love you.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.760
The coast is clear.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.280
Thank you.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.440
We have to tell them, Jean.

04:40.440 --> 04:43.000
We will, just not yet.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.320
Things have only just...

04:45.480 --> 04:48.000
settled down between Otis and I, and...

04:48.720 --> 04:50.000
Well, he's not ready yet.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.800
Okay, but soon.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.320
Mmm.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.280
I think I have a problem.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.800
My body has complete control over me.

05:03.880 --> 05:08.400
You have discovered the wonders
of your own penis, my friend.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.320
It's normal.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.360
It's not normal.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.200
Last night I looked at some cheese,
and I got an erection.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.520
What type of cheese?

05:15.400 --> 05:16.720
-Brie.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.880
But I swear, it could have been anything.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.200
The other day, I was riding my bike,
and I get a boner out of nowhere.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.720
Nothing but trees around me.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.200
Corduroy trousers?

05:26.120 --> 05:28.440
-Yeah, how did you know?
-Too much friction.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.920
Why are you wanking so much?
You've got a girlfriend now.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.960
-Ola and I are taking things slow.
-Dude,

05:33.040 --> 05:36.760
you have the untapped sexual knowledge
of a tantric master.

05:36.840 --> 05:39.080
-What are you waiting for?
-I don't know.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.440
It's a lot of pressure, all right?

05:41.520 --> 05:44.640
I have all the theory,
but in practice, I know nothing.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.400
So what if Ola finds out
about your wank problem?

05:47.800 --> 05:49.080
I thought you said it was normal?

05:58.240 --> 06:00.000
Oh, shit.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.400
Enjoy the poverty shuttle!

06:21.720 --> 06:23.920
I know. I need to be better.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.920
You want that sports scholarship,
don't you?

06:27.320 --> 06:28.160
Yeah.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.680
Well, push yourself a bit harder,
and we'll be halfway there.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.520
I need to get to assembly, okay?

07:04.720 --> 07:06.080
Still no news from Maeve then?

07:06.160 --> 07:08.640
Nope. That is okay.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.400
It's a new term.
No more clinic, no more drama.

07:12.480 --> 07:13.800
You can't give it up.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.600
Think of all the status
you're throwing away.

07:15.680 --> 07:19.040
Knowing everyone's secret sex shame
isn't going to make me popular.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.840
No, it's going to make you all-powerful.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.320
Um, maybe don't mention
the whole clinic thing to Ola.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.320
-She might think it's weird.
-'Cause it was weird.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.600
-Hey.
-Hi.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.080
Oh, you guys are super cute,
but stop now, it's disgusting.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.040
How are you feeling? You nervous?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.080
Yeah, a little bit.

07:35.520 --> 07:38.480
-Is there anything I should know about?
-Um, no, not really.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.840
Nothing interesting ever happens
around here.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.440
There's a plague!

07:47.840 --> 07:49.320
Don't let them breathe on you.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.600
Why does it look like
<i>The Walking Dead</i> in here?

07:54.680 --> 07:57.680
-What is going on?
-Chlamydia. Everyone's got it.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.520
One for a fiver, three for ten.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.240
You can't catch chlamydia from the air.
You have to have had sexual contact

08:02.320 --> 08:03.280
-with a carrier.
- Ssh!

08:03.360 --> 08:06.720
They don't know that, do they?
Don't kill my business, man.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.200
Simon. Simon! That is highly unethical.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.080
I've got to go and meet my chaperone,
but I've got a free period after lunch.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.840
-So do I.
-Do you want to hang at mine?

08:14.920 --> 08:16.440
Yes. Yes, let's hang.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.200
-Okay, see you later.
-Let's hang. See you.

08:18.720 --> 08:19.680
-Bye.
-Bye.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.600
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah! Yeah!
-Stop that.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.600
We all know what "hang" is code for.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.360
It is time to put the theory
into practice, my friend.

08:28.440 --> 08:31.160
-You never know-- Oh, my God.
-Sex kid! I think I've got chlamydia,

08:31.240 --> 08:33.480
and I read that I should rub bleach
on my vagina, is that true?

08:33.560 --> 08:35.720
I'm not giving out advice anymore,
but do not rub bleach

08:35.800 --> 08:37.200
anywhere on your body.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.800
-Go to your GP.
-Excuse me. Otto.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.760
Can one get chlamydia of the eye?

08:41.840 --> 08:42.840
Okay, it's Otis,

08:42.920 --> 08:45.880
and if infected genital fluids
got into your eye, then, yes,

08:45.960 --> 08:47.800
you can have chlamydia of the eye.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.160
But I've never had sex.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.560
It's probably conjunctivitis,

08:50.640 --> 08:53.360
but I'm not giving advice anymore,
so go to your doctor, please.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.800
-Uh, you have to help them.
-Why, it's...

08:56.600 --> 08:59.000
-It's not the same without Maeve.
-Why? Her job is so easy.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.920
It's just booking appointments
and taking money. I'll do it for you.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.800
I got a B plus
in business studies last year.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.800
-You never did business studies.
-That's irrelevant.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.520
Let me guess,
you think you have chlamydia?

09:07.600 --> 09:10.200
No. My girlfriend says
my cum tastes like kimchi.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.800
Why do I have a fermented dick?

09:11.880 --> 09:14.160
Well, the taste of semen varies
from person to person.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.800
I can only suggest you have
a healthy and balanced diet.

09:16.880 --> 09:20.200
However, I'm not giving advice anymore,
so you'll have to get help somewhere else.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.280
Admit it. You like giving advice.

09:24.360 --> 09:27.720
Listen, Maeve has moved on,
and so have I. That's it.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.240
-Okay? End of story.
-Oh!

09:30.320 --> 09:32.360
Why are you running
from your true calling?

09:32.440 --> 09:34.440
-I'm not running.
-It's literally in your DNA, Otis.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.600
Otis!

09:35.680 --> 09:38.080
Yes, we are fully aware of the outbreak.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.440
I can assure you it's, uh...

09:41.920 --> 09:43.640
Oh! My dick!

09:44.080 --> 09:45.560
...under control.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.280
-Ah, can I call you back, Mrs. Hanratty?

09:49.360 --> 09:50.320
Thank you so much.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.720
The chairman of the board is here.
She's heard about the situation.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.920
Show her in.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.480
Quickly! Quickly! And take that thing off.

10:00.320 --> 10:04.040
-Ah! Maxine! What a pleasure to see you.
-In a bit of a pickle, are we?

10:04.120 --> 10:05.440
Pick...

10:05.520 --> 10:08.080
No, no, no.
Everything is completely under control.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.080
I don't want to see
"Moordale Chlamydia Outbreak"

10:11.160 --> 10:12.960
as a headline in the papers tomorrow.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.720
So, what are we doing to neutralize this?

10:16.280 --> 10:17.520
W...

10:17.600 --> 10:21.440
Hm. Well, I am organizing an...

10:22.560 --> 10:25.080
emergency parents' assembly tonight.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.200
Uh, we will nip this in the bud.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.320
Very good.

10:33.760 --> 10:34.640
I'm walking now.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.160
Call all the parents,
emergency assembly tonight.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.600
I'm looking for my chaperone.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.640
Hello, I'm Lily.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.960
Oh. I love<i> Tank Girl.</i>

10:51.600 --> 10:53.720
Yeah. It's criminally underrated.

10:54.640 --> 10:57.080
There's two black-hooded rats mating
in the biology lab,

10:57.160 --> 10:59.160
if you wanted to go
and see after assembly.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.920
They have surprisingly large phalluses.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.040
Okay.

11:08.640 --> 11:12.120
<i>♪ Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah</i>

11:29.080 --> 11:31.000
Apparently Fiona Brady is patient zero.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.680
She had an orgy at music camp,
and it spread from there.

11:34.080 --> 11:37.400
It is highly unlikely
that this many people have chlamydia.

11:37.760 --> 11:40.680
I think this is a classic case
of mass hysteria.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.440
What the fuck are you doing?
You stood on my foot.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.320
-Ow!

If you hadn't been such a slut
in the first place,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.200
-we wouldn't be in this situation.
-Shut the fuck up!

11:59.360 --> 12:01.000
-Are you actually crying?
-You dirty fucker.

Oh, my God.
They are butchering Jermaine Stewart.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.480
At least I'm not miming.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.720
- Stupid bitch.
- Oh!

12:16.600 --> 12:18.440
I've got to go. Sorry. Excuse me.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.520
Ooh!

12:22.520 --> 12:23.880
Sorry. Sorry.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.280
-Don't push me.
-You've ruined this for every--

12:40.040 --> 12:42.680

12:42.760 --> 12:46.680
Let's hear it for... Asking For Treble!

12:47.240 --> 12:49.280
Earth-shattering stuff, huh?

12:51.320 --> 12:52.560
You're a slut.

13:12.800 --> 13:13.640
More chocolate.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.360
Sir, I've covered your pretzel
in chocolate three times now.

13:16.440 --> 13:17.640
More chocolate.

13:36.680 --> 13:37.840
You've got to be kidding me.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.080
Uh...

13:45.000 --> 13:46.920
Wiley, get back here!

14:02.560 --> 14:03.760
I can see you.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.040
Hi, Frogface. It's me, Mum.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.040
Yes, I know who you are. What do you want?

14:20.240 --> 14:22.240
-Nice wank?
-I told you I have a problem.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.800
Jesus is Lord.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.920
-Hey. How you doing?
-Hey, man.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.320
Hey? You all right?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.320
I thought I just saw someone, but...

14:44.560 --> 14:45.560
Can I talk to you?

14:46.040 --> 14:48.520
Martha and Gwen are going to kick me out
of acapella group

14:48.600 --> 14:51.080
if I don't own up
to giving them chlamydia, but it's not me.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.720
I've been tested, and I don't have it.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.680
I'm not giving out advice anymore,

14:54.760 --> 14:56.800
but I don't actually think
anyone has chlamydia,

14:56.880 --> 14:59.120
-it's just mass hysteria.
-No, they definitely did have it.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.840
They've been tested and treated,
but they're convinced it's my fault,

15:01.920 --> 15:04.280
and now everyone in school thinks
I'm a walking STI.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.480
I heard Fiona caught chlamydia
from doing bukakke with five guys.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.480
Ugh. What a slut.

15:12.240 --> 15:16.240
Please. This is so humiliating,
I don't know what to do.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.400
Okay, um, this is Eric.
He's in charge of appointments.

15:25.480 --> 15:27.360
-He'll book you in.
-I don't have a diary yet,

15:27.440 --> 15:30.360
but I'll just use the natural
organizational skills of my brain.

15:30.880 --> 15:31.800
Thank you.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.080
Is that true, Tim?

15:37.960 --> 15:42.600
Did you tell Clara that you enjoyed
the dog's company more than hers?

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
Yes.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.520
Can you elaborate?

15:50.320 --> 15:51.360
The dog is...

15:52.080 --> 15:53.480
really quiet.

16:12.800 --> 16:13.720
Right.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.520
Why do you guys think it was Fiona
that give you chlamydia?

16:17.600 --> 16:19.520
She had a threesome at music camp.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.400
And gave Sammy Watson a hand job
during <i>Mozart's Concerto 21.</i>

16:22.480 --> 16:25.840
And everybody knows she put
Jamal Jacob's clarinet up her fanny!

16:25.920 --> 16:28.400
Can we please stop slut-shaming Fiona?

16:28.480 --> 16:31.640
She has had a full sexual health checkup
and is clear of STIs,

16:31.720 --> 16:33.120
and neither of you have slept with her,

16:33.200 --> 16:36.360
so I don't understand how you could
possibly think she gave it to you.

16:36.440 --> 16:39.880
Because she put her slutty mouth
all over our shared pitch whistle.

16:39.960 --> 16:42.200
-Yeah, that's how we caught it!
-I don't have chlamydia!

16:42.280 --> 16:44.120
How many times have I told you?

16:44.200 --> 16:46.560
-He literally said over and over--

16:46.640 --> 16:48.040
Stop. Stop!

16:50.040 --> 16:53.960
Even if Fiona had chlamydia,
which she doesn't,

16:54.040 --> 16:56.520
you cannot catch an STI
from a pitch whistle.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.240
It's too late.
Everyone still thinks it's me anyway.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.640
You guys are sexually active, right?

17:04.400 --> 17:06.240
- Yeah.
-With multiple partners?

17:06.640 --> 17:08.320
- Yeah.
-Great.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.600
Well, I'm going to need both of you
to make a list

17:11.680 --> 17:13.800
of everyone you've had
recent sexual contact with

17:13.880 --> 17:15.440
so we can find out who it really was.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.040
Then you can start telling people
it wasn't Fiona.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.480
Names.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.880
The sober virgins enjoy Tolstoy
and saving themselves for marriage.

17:35.960 --> 17:40.120
Then he says, "Yes, Daddy, but you see,
I <i>have</i> to buy a horse."

17:43.720 --> 17:45.440
The bong rats
can't remember their own names

17:45.520 --> 17:47.840
and still think
farts are the height of comedy.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.520
Hey!

17:53.320 --> 17:56.520
The Untouchables rule over us
with an iron fist of terror.

17:56.600 --> 17:57.960
Nice dungarees.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.080
Thanks.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.320
Don't make eye contact.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.040
-But he likes my dungarees.
-He doesn't like anyone's dungarees.

18:04.760 --> 18:05.600
-Oh, my God.

18:05.680 --> 18:10.080

a very small orgasm.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.400
He's from France.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.480
And I heard he's a son
of a Middle Eastern prince.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.880
I heard he's Kim Kardashian's
secret adopted brother.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.440
He will be my boyfriend, okay?

18:34.000 --> 18:34.960
Hmm.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.360
Fuck me.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.680
So, we've spoken to Luke Hanratty
and Niall Spencer,

18:43.760 --> 18:45.760
and they've both been tested.
They're clear.

18:45.840 --> 18:46.680
Okay.

18:46.760 --> 18:50.120
Martha said she only kissed Tom Baker,
so we can cross him off the list.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.920
Oh, my God. Otis.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.560
Otis.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.080
Otis.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.000
Otis!

19:00.680 --> 19:01.680
What?

19:03.520 --> 19:06.640
The hottest man I've ever seen
just walked past me,

19:06.720 --> 19:08.720
and you missed it because of chlamydia.

19:08.800 --> 19:09.880
Ah.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.680
So, there's only one more name
on this list.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.000
Really?

19:20.040 --> 19:21.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:21.520 --> 19:23.720
J-Dog, it's O-Town.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.320
Ah, it's Otis.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.280
-What do you want?
-Well...

19:29.720 --> 19:32.280
We were wondering why
you gave the acapella group chlamydia.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.000
-Pardon?
-We were wondering--

19:35.080 --> 19:36.320
It would seem that...

19:36.880 --> 19:40.200
you had relations with Martha and Gwen
who then both had chlamydia.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.960
-So I'm just trying to--
-I never have sex without protection.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.400
I've also been tested.
Would you like to see the results?

19:45.800 --> 19:46.640
-No.
-Yes.

19:46.720 --> 19:50.080
That is exactly what we want,
Jackson Marchetti.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.280
Come on.

19:54.920 --> 19:55.920
Thank you.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.800
-I believe you.
-Yeah, but here we are.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.000
He's clear. He's clear.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.360
Uh, yeah, you're good.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.800
Thank you for taking
such an active interest in my sex life.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.400
Oh, say hi to Maeve for me.

20:10.480 --> 20:11.600
Ooh.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.120
I mean, I haven't seen her.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.400
Why does Jackson hate you now?

20:23.600 --> 20:24.520
Shut up.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.600
Dude, you're erect again!

20:30.520 --> 20:33.760
Was it the chlamydia or Jackson
that gave you a hard-on?

20:33.840 --> 20:37.160
Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.560
-Your sister's got big, ain't she?
-Half sister.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.360
I grew you in the same womb,
you're sisters.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.640
So you got her back then?

20:46.720 --> 20:49.200
She was only at her dad's mum's
for a bit, it was a blip.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.440
I bet you got a right fright, didn't you?
Seeing me out of the blue?

20:53.080 --> 20:53.920
Yeah.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.600
I'm on step nine of NA.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.720
-Making amends to those--
-...you've harmed in the past.

21:01.800 --> 21:04.320
-We've been here before, Erin.
-Don't call me Erin, I'm your mother.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.120
It's different this time.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.200
I've got a proper sponsor,
been clean for a year.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.800
I was waiting until I was really stable
before I came back, and here I am.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.080
So nice of you
to fit me into your schedule.

21:18.440 --> 21:19.720
Some things don't change.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.040
I think you'll find
quite a lot has changed, Erin.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.560
Don't talk with your mouth full.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.800
Do you know what? I don't really feel like
making amends this time.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.760

22:53.560 --> 22:56.360

- I'm sorry. Please just come back.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.520

23:00.400 --> 23:01.440

-Fuck!

23:01.520 --> 23:03.360
-Otis!
-Mum!

23:03.440 --> 23:04.320
What?

23:04.400 --> 23:06.120
-Dad?
-What the fuck?

23:06.200 --> 23:07.440
-I'm sorry.
-Darling.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.840
-What the fuck is going on?

23:08.920 --> 23:10.200
I'm sorry.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.920
I'm sorry.

23:14.680 --> 23:18.360
We didn't want our relationship
to affect your relationship.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.480
-Relationship?
-Your mother and I are dating.

23:22.720 --> 23:23.960
My mum doesn't date.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.160
Tell him, Mum.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.800
Jakob and I are dating.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.680
What, you mean like having casual sex?

23:31.760 --> 23:33.520
-Otis.
-Darling, it's...

23:34.520 --> 23:35.800
not just casual.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.360
Is there anything you want to say?

23:42.440 --> 23:46.520
This is a safe space.
You can express any negative feelings.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.480
You're dating my girlfriend's dad.

23:50.200 --> 23:53.200
I was just starting to feel like
a normal teenager,

23:53.280 --> 23:56.360
and now you go
and make me feel like a freak, again!

23:57.280 --> 23:58.680
Otis.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.080
-It's all right.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.480
He'll come around.

24:01.920 --> 24:03.200
This is a good thing.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.160
Can I bum one of those?

24:09.240 --> 24:11.560
You're not supposed to smoke
in front of children.

24:11.640 --> 24:15.200
Well, I'm bound to fuck her up anyway.
What's a bit of second-hand smoke?

24:23.720 --> 24:26.920
I know you don't believe me,
but it is different this time.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.680
Look.

24:30.800 --> 24:31.640
I found these.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.720
-You always loved sparkly things.
-They're hideous.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.520
Oh, come on. They match your locks.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.320
I used to dye my hair like that
when I was your age.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.560
Where are you getting money
for gifts from?

24:45.640 --> 24:46.760
I'm seeing someone.

24:47.600 --> 24:50.040
His name is James. I met him at NA.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.480
He's got his life together,
and he's helping me stay on track.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.720
He really understands
how hard recovery can be.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.480
Please don't tell me
you shagged your sponsor.

24:59.520 --> 25:02.320
-You're unbelievable.
-Well, he's not my sponsor anymore, is he?

25:02.400 --> 25:03.840
I've got a new sponsor now.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.000
I really am taking it seriously, you know?

25:11.040 --> 25:12.760
Mummy'll be there in a minute, darling.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.720
And he's great with Elsie.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.040
He loves kids.

25:18.120 --> 25:19.600
Does Jimbo know about me and Sean?

25:22.160 --> 25:23.560
Of course he doesn't.

25:28.440 --> 25:33.080
-So are you selling pretzels permanently?
-Nope, I'm still at school.

25:34.120 --> 25:37.080
-I'm not going to be a drop-out like you.
-Well, that makes sense.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.280
You could recite the alphabet
when you were about one.

25:40.360 --> 25:41.840
It was quite freaky.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.480
I will tell him about you and Sean,
I promise.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.720
Your promises
don't mean shit anymore, Erin.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.080
I quit.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.240
No, you're fired!

26:16.680 --> 26:18.840
Good evening, parents of Moordale.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.600
Our children are dying!

26:20.680 --> 26:21.800
Yeah!

26:21.880 --> 26:22.960
No one is dying.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.760
And how will you stop them dying?

26:24.840 --> 26:26.280
Yeah!

26:26.360 --> 26:29.960
Well, we are encouraging all the students
to get treated with antibiotics,

26:30.040 --> 26:34.240
and we will be re-educating them
on safer sex practices.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.560
-Uh, everything is fine.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.560
Teenagers don't listen!

26:41.560 --> 26:45.680
How will you be re-educating them
on safer sex practices?

26:45.760 --> 26:46.920
Yeah!

26:47.000 --> 26:50.720
Well, by re-educating them on safer sex...

26:51.680 --> 26:53.400
- Come on.
- Come on!

26:54.000 --> 26:55.040
...practices.

26:55.120 --> 27:00.680
I believe what we're dealing with here
is an outbreak of STI hysteria,

27:00.760 --> 27:03.760
rather than an outbreak of chlamydia.

27:03.840 --> 27:07.920
You cannot catch this disease
through breathing.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.760
It is spread through genital fluids,

27:10.840 --> 27:13.520
exchanged during unprotected sex.

27:13.600 --> 27:17.840
However, it is the misinformation
about the disease

27:17.920 --> 27:19.520
that's hugely problematic.

27:19.600 --> 27:24.080
It comes shrouded in shame
and misunderstanding.

27:24.600 --> 27:28.600
And is precisely how
this kind of hysteria is spread.

27:28.680 --> 27:29.920
Yeah.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
So, how will you be addressing that?

27:33.080 --> 27:34.440
Yeah.

27:34.520 --> 27:39.040
We will be returning to our tried
and tested sex education curriculum.

27:39.120 --> 27:42.760
-Well, with all due respect, sir,

27:42.840 --> 27:45.320
your curriculum isn't working.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.160
As a sexual health professional,

27:48.240 --> 27:51.280
may I suggest that you look into
tailoring your program

27:51.360 --> 27:55.040
to give our teenagers the correct tools

27:55.120 --> 27:59.000
to be able to free themselves
from this unwarranted stigma?

27:59.920 --> 28:02.840
And what exactly are those tools?

28:03.240 --> 28:04.600
The three Ts.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.120
Trust.

28:06.840 --> 28:07.880
Talking.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.040
-And truth.

28:18.200 --> 28:21.640
-No, no, no.
-That's what we need! Right there.

28:24.840 --> 28:25.720
Whoo!

28:28.440 --> 28:30.120
Yes... Thank you.

28:34.440 --> 28:37.320
You are very sexy when you're passionate.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.320
Yes, fine.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.640
Of course he's got a training plan, Roz.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.160
The coach says he's got to focus.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.160
Well, he's lost all of his focus
since he broke up with that girl.

29:00.240 --> 29:03.520
He's had his first heartbreak.
It's normal.

29:04.520 --> 29:07.320
I told you.
We should never have let him date her.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.400
Oh, as long as it's my fault then.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.640
What? How are you making this about you?

29:11.720 --> 29:14.560
- I'm here too, you know.
- Don't we know it.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.040
You're right, Mum.

29:20.520 --> 29:21.680
I haven't been focused.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.560
But I really want to see this through,
and I'm going to make you proud.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.000
Both of you.

29:28.720 --> 29:29.720
I promise.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.560
Now, please, just...

29:34.480 --> 29:35.680
just stop fighting.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.680
<i>♪ Wake up, I feel a little out of focus ♪</i>

29:54.680 --> 29:58.920
<i>♪ Grab the last of the beauty</i>
<i>That I left by the bedside ♪</i>

30:01.240 --> 30:03.520
<i>♪ Wake up, I feel a little bit fuzzy ♪</i>

30:03.600 --> 30:05.280

30:10.240 --> 30:12.360
<i>♪ Drink it down, wake up ♪</i>

30:19.360 --> 30:22.360
Otis, Otis. Okay, so...

30:22.920 --> 30:24.800
you know the whole
natural organizational skills

30:24.880 --> 30:27.640
of my brain thing? Yeah, well, you've got
three appointments today,

30:27.720 --> 30:30.360
I don't know where, what time,
or with who.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.680
-Dude!
-I'm sorry. Don't come for me, man.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.400
I'm gonna start writing it down.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.800
Who's next on the chlamydia list?

30:36.880 --> 30:40.080
Well, we've spoken to all of them,
and they all say they're clear.

30:40.520 --> 30:42.200
Well, at least we tried, man.

30:42.600 --> 30:43.680
Rumors die down eventually.

30:43.760 --> 30:47.000
- Who do you think you got it from?
- It was the choir chick, Fiona.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.240
She's banged every gentleman
in the school.

30:49.320 --> 30:50.560
She's dirty, man.

30:51.920 --> 30:53.560
We need to talk to the girls again.

30:53.920 --> 30:57.920
Speaking of dirty, sexy times,
how did things go with Ola yesterday?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.720
I do not want to talk about it.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.280
-Why, what happened?

31:02.240 --> 31:03.080
No.

31:06.840 --> 31:09.040
Something very bad happened.

31:12.440 --> 31:13.520
What?

31:14.400 --> 31:15.560
Okay, um...

31:15.640 --> 31:17.640
-So, Ola and I tried to, you know--
-Have sex?

31:17.720 --> 31:19.760
No, but we tried to do more than kissing,
and she--

31:19.840 --> 31:21.280
-Wanked you off?
-And I couldn't--

31:21.360 --> 31:23.280
-Get hard.
-So now I'm wondering

31:23.360 --> 31:27.400
whether maybe I've masturbated so much
that my penis has run out of erections.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.760
Eric, it's not funny.

31:35.520 --> 31:36.360
Who goes there?

31:39.120 --> 31:41.960
Well, I wasn't going to come out,
because what you're talking about

31:42.040 --> 31:45.160
is very strange and embarrassing,
and I thought it would be awkward.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.200
You should wash your hands, you dirty pig!

31:49.280 --> 31:50.400
I didn't do a poo.

31:52.120 --> 31:52.960
I was crying.

31:53.880 --> 31:54.720
Oh.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.280
Right, well, I hope you're okay.

31:57.920 --> 31:58.840
Thank you.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.800
-What an odd little man.

32:06.440 --> 32:07.280
Good form, man.

32:09.560 --> 32:10.720
Yes. Nice.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.040
Let's go.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.280
Nice.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.600
Fuck! Shit! Bollocks!

32:30.680 --> 32:33.800
Get Coach, come on!
Get an ambulance!

32:33.880 --> 32:35.240
Shit!

32:42.240 --> 32:43.840
Uh, no. No, no, no, no.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.280
Chlamydia.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.920
Smallpox doesn't exist anymore,
Mrs. Gibbs.

32:51.640 --> 32:52.520
Can I call you back?

32:54.040 --> 32:56.720
-Wiley, you're barred from campus.
-Okay, please hear me out.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.400
I know you don't think so, but I deserve
a second chance at this school.

32:59.480 --> 33:01.840
The things you said about my family
are true, and I messed up,

33:01.920 --> 33:05.520
but I don't want to be like them.
I know I have more in me than that.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.320
I believe that I'm an asset
to your institution.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.280
How so?

33:09.720 --> 33:13.040
These are the student essays
that make your grade average so high.

33:14.280 --> 33:15.680
I wrote every single one of them.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.280
Leave my office immediately.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.040
Read them and see.

33:22.680 --> 33:24.400
If you let me back in,
I won't tell everyone

33:24.480 --> 33:26.120
that your school is full of cheats.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.760
I will call the police

33:29.840 --> 33:32.600
if you do not leave my office
immediately.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.320
-What?

33:36.040 --> 33:38.960
The chairman is here again,
she wants to see the new gymnasium.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.600
Wiley, get out.

34:16.840 --> 34:18.880
-You're back.
-Just visiting.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.400
-Changed your hair.
-Perceptive.

34:25.680 --> 34:28.000
-How've you been? I...

34:29.200 --> 34:30.160
miss you.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.520
You better get to class.

34:36.240 --> 34:37.080
Yeah.

34:38.160 --> 34:39.000
Okay.

34:42.720 --> 34:44.480
Have you gone goth, cockbiter?

34:44.560 --> 34:47.440
I think you're lost.
Pretzel Parlor's back at the mall.

34:47.520 --> 34:48.560
Yeah.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.480
I've just seen Carl Mason
use your car as a skate ramp.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.360
Oh, for fuck's sake.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.480
Masks off, everyone. Jesus.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.800
But Fiona's given everyone chlamydia, sir.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.720
-Tell them that's not true.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.480
-You're supposed to be my friends.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.680
Go and see if she's okay.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.080
Come on.

35:35.800 --> 35:39.800
Okay, who wants to know about molecules?

35:39.880 --> 35:41.960
- <i>Good afternoon, Moordale. </i>

35:42.040 --> 35:44.800
<i>It's your ex-resident cockbiter,</i>
<i>Maeve Wiley, speaking.</i>

35:45.320 --> 35:47.880
<i>Here to read some of your brilliant,</i>
<i>prize-winning essays.</i>

35:48.320 --> 35:50.640
<i>Let's start with Ruby Matthews'</i>
<i>A-star essay</i>

35:50.720 --> 35:52.720
<i>on Shakespeare's relationship</i>
<i>to female empowerment.</i>

35:52.800 --> 35:54.320
It's a real belter, isn't it, Ruby?

35:55.120 --> 35:57.200
Except you wouldn't know,
because I wrote it.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.000
<i>-Okay, so...</i>
-Sir, come quickly, there's a fight.

36:01.080 --> 36:02.640
Fight!

36:09.520 --> 36:12.480
<i>"It's most useful to examine</i>
<i>this topic through the theme of marriage,</i>

36:12.560 --> 36:14.520
as this is the framework
within which the majority

36:14.600 --> 36:17.000
of Shakespeare's female protagonists
are permitted to function.

36:17.680 --> 36:21.360
The women in both <i>Othello </i>and <i>Much Ado</i>
aim to take control over whom they marry

36:21.440 --> 36:22.640
or if they must marry at all.

36:23.320 --> 36:26.480
<i>Desdemona's decision to marry Othello</i>
<i>against her father's wishes</i>

36:26.560 --> 36:28.760
was so singular
that it is almost transcendent."

36:28.840 --> 36:31.000
Maeve! What are you doing?

36:31.080 --> 36:33.600
-Well, I've got nothing to lose, have I?
-Wiley!

36:36.160 --> 36:38.440
-What exactly is happening here?

36:39.680 --> 36:40.560
Nothing.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.360
Just reading some non-plagiarized,

36:43.440 --> 36:45.800
top-line, A-star essays
for shits and giggles.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.360
What is she talking about?

36:48.400 --> 36:50.320
Would you like to tell her, or shall I?

36:51.600 --> 36:53.920
Every year we read out the best essays
students have written

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
to celebrate Moordale's achievements.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.280
This is Maeve Wiley,
one of our brightest pupils.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.360
She's recently joined our Aptitude Scheme.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.840
So you get students to read out essays
in the middle of class time?

37:04.920 --> 37:05.800
Yes.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.760
It's a... tradition.

37:07.840 --> 37:11.720
A very silly tradition
that we must stop immediately.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.760
An STI outbreak, mass class interruption.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.240
I'm sorry, what's next?

37:17.360 --> 37:20.200
Little monkeys instead of teachers?
Creationism?

37:20.280 --> 37:22.400
It's anarchy.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.080
- Oh...

37:30.080 --> 37:31.280
Off you go, Maeve.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.920
-Miss Sands. You--
-I think the chairman would be

37:45.000 --> 37:48.040
very interested to know that your son
won the essay prize by cheating,

37:48.480 --> 37:50.000
and that you knew about it.

37:50.080 --> 37:53.240
Maeve will be re-enrolled at school,
and that's the end of it.

38:12.200 --> 38:16.840
<i>♪ When two tribes go to war</i>
<i>One is all that you can score ♪</i>

38:17.560 --> 38:19.480
<i>♪ Score no more, score no more ♪</i>

38:19.560 --> 38:24.440
<i>♪ When two tribes go to war</i>
<i>One is all that you can score ♪</i>

38:27.320 --> 38:29.800
Ah, ferocious.
Right, I'm going to go get help.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.960
There's nothing more scary
than a woman fight.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.400
-What?
-I'm going.

38:33.480 --> 38:36.720
Otis! Debbie,
get out of the way. Otis.

38:38.120 --> 38:40.240
We need to do something.
They'll kill each other, right?

38:40.320 --> 38:43.840
-I know!
-When I say "we," I mean "you." Go!

38:43.920 --> 38:44.800
Go!

38:45.600 --> 38:48.600
Girls, okay. Sorry to interrupt.
Can you just stop fighting?

38:48.680 --> 38:49.720
Eric!

38:49.800 --> 38:52.120
-What the hell's going on?
-Okay, so, Gwen and Martha

38:52.200 --> 38:54.480
think that Fiona gave them chlamydia,
but she's clear.

38:54.560 --> 38:57.280
So we checked all the boys they slept with
and they're clear too. Look.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.840
- Stop it.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.280
Oh, my God. Jesus be with him.

39:00.360 --> 39:03.320
-Why isn't Owen's name on here?
-Who's Owen?

39:03.800 --> 39:06.560
-That guy.
- What? Pointless acapella kid?

39:06.640 --> 39:08.880
Yeah, Gwen and Martha
have been sleeping with him for ages.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.800
He's always crying in the toilets
'cause they're trying to keep it a secret.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.880
-How do you know that?
-Because I know everything.

39:14.800 --> 39:15.960
Otis needs help.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.280
Oh, my God. Time to do something.

39:19.360 --> 39:21.040
Excuse me, please. Excuse me now.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.720
-You slut!
-Slag!

39:22.800 --> 39:23.640
Bitches!

39:26.560 --> 39:28.600
You gave me chlamydia!

39:34.960 --> 39:37.080
No...

39:40.480 --> 39:42.160
Otis!

39:45.760 --> 39:46.960
Otis? Otis.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.200
Yes!

39:49.200 --> 39:50.840
Excuse me. Excuse me.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.600
Speak up.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.600
Okay, speak from the diaphragm.
Okay? Go on.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.720
Owen has something to tell you,
don't you, Owen?

40:02.160 --> 40:03.200
What?

40:04.560 --> 40:07.160
It was me who gave
Martha and Gwen chlamydia.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.400
Well, I found out I had it
and got treated.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.640
But didn't tell them
I probably passed it on.

40:11.720 --> 40:12.680
Uh-huh.

40:13.920 --> 40:16.200
-Why didn't you tell them?
-Why didn't you tell them?

40:16.280 --> 40:18.440
They're already ashamed
of sleeping with me.

40:19.760 --> 40:22.760
Apparently, I'm boring and uncool.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.080
Imagine if they knew I had an STI too.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.360
It is not shameful to have chlamydia,

40:29.960 --> 40:33.040
-but it's wrong to lie about it.
-It was wrong to lie about it.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.360
We all have flaws,

40:34.920 --> 40:37.360
and our bodies do things
we have no control over.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.360
But we can always control being truthful.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.880
I think you deserve better
than to be someone's secret, Owen.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.320
But you have to be honest

40:47.400 --> 40:50.440
-with your sexual partners in the future.
-That's all they're asking for.

40:50.520 --> 40:51.480
I will.

40:53.560 --> 40:54.400
And...

40:54.720 --> 40:57.600
you should maybe tell your girlfriend
about your wanking problem.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.320
The truth will set you free.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.040
I didn't ask to be therapized.

41:02.120 --> 41:04.680
I didn't ask to be therapized either,
to be fair.

41:04.760 --> 41:08.280
Uh, I think that we've had quite enough
of you today. Go on.

41:12.000 --> 41:12.920
Owen.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.880
Uncalled for and unnecessary.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.160
This institution is in disarray,

41:18.240 --> 41:21.520
and if you don't pull it together,
you'll no longer be headmaster.

41:22.040 --> 41:25.320
I'll be checking in every month,
and I expect to see a turnaround.

41:25.760 --> 41:26.600
Understood.

41:27.960 --> 41:28.800
Good.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.600
Hi, Headmaster Groff.

41:50.240 --> 41:52.600
I was just wondering
when Adam would be back?

41:53.040 --> 41:54.320
He won't be.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.880
-Oh.
-Do not worry, Eric.

41:56.960 --> 42:00.280
My son will no longer be making
your life difficult.

42:02.800 --> 42:03.720
Okay.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.080
Thank you.

42:10.320 --> 42:14.120
Why is he talking to her?
Do they like ugly noses in France?

42:16.040 --> 42:17.120
I like your shirt.

42:18.680 --> 42:20.840
I like your shirt too, Eric.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.040
Yeah. I mean, it's not completely hideous.

42:29.720 --> 42:30.640
Hi.

42:30.720 --> 42:31.680
Hey.

42:32.520 --> 42:33.880
We need to talk.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.320
Yeah. Yeah.

42:37.400 --> 42:38.400
Um...

42:42.920 --> 42:44.040
Look, I'm sorry.

42:45.440 --> 42:46.880
What's going on with you?

42:48.480 --> 42:51.960
I think I'm addicted to wanking,

42:52.040 --> 42:54.280
'cause I've only just started,
but I can't seem to stop,

42:54.360 --> 42:57.560
and I think I might have broken my penis
because I do it too much.

42:57.640 --> 42:59.960
-That's why it wasn't working.

43:00.040 --> 43:01.600
Ah. Okay.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.400
If you want to break up with me,
I understand.

43:06.720 --> 43:08.640
You're very unusual, Otis,

43:08.720 --> 43:10.600
but I don't want to break up with you.

43:10.960 --> 43:12.960
It's all new for both of us.

43:13.040 --> 43:15.680
We'll just figure it out together. Okay?

43:17.000 --> 43:17.840
Yeah.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.000
Stop kissing my daughter!

43:25.080 --> 43:25.920
Oh!

43:26.520 --> 43:28.880
Just kidding. I'm here to see your mum.

43:31.960 --> 43:32.800
Sorry.

43:35.080 --> 43:36.040
Jackson.

43:37.200 --> 43:40.840
You have a metacarpal fracture.
You'll be in a cast for about six weeks.

43:40.920 --> 43:43.480
No swimming
for the foreseeable future. Sorry.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.560
-Can I get someone to sign some forms?
-Yeah.

43:56.440 --> 43:57.520
What happened?

43:59.640 --> 44:02.240
Mum, I'm fine. I'm fine.

44:03.800 --> 44:05.240
I just wasn't concentrating.

44:06.120 --> 44:08.560
It was a stupid accident, okay?

44:11.680 --> 44:12.520
Okay.

44:16.000 --> 44:16.960
Silly boy.

44:56.920 --> 44:57.760
Hi.

44:59.320 --> 45:00.480
Do you need some help?

45:01.280 --> 45:04.040
Well, I didn't ask for any, so, no.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.600
-Okay.
-Looks like we're neighbors. I'm Joe.

45:08.560 --> 45:10.280
That ungrateful git's Isaac.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.440
I'm Maeve, and I don't like noise.

45:14.000 --> 45:14.840
Okay.

45:21.640 --> 45:23.400
Otis, too long!

45:27.840 --> 45:29.960
No more hot water, I'm afraid.

45:30.040 --> 45:32.440
I'll look at your boiler if you like.

45:33.120 --> 45:34.680
-Smoothie?
-No!

45:36.560 --> 45:38.080
Oh, God.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.200
Jean Milburn speaking.

45:51.280 --> 45:54.120
<i>Jean. Maxine Tarrington here,</i>
<i>Moordale's chairman.</i>

45:54.200 --> 45:56.320

<i>I was at the parents' assembly,</i>

45:56.400 --> 45:58.160
<i>and I agree with everything you said.</i>

45:58.360 --> 46:02.240
<i>The state of our sex education</i>
<i>is appalling. It needs a rethink.</i>

46:03.000 --> 46:07.080
Well, I can recommend some great people
to help revamp the curriculum

46:07.160 --> 46:08.080
if you'd like.

Which group is Maeve in?

47:00.640 --> 47:01.920
She was kind of a loner

47:02.000 --> 47:04.920
until she started running
that sex clinic thing with Otis,

47:05.280 --> 47:07.080
and then they would hang out all the time.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.840
I wonder if they'll do it again
now she's back?

47:28.560 --> 47:32.200
You do realize you can't do what you do
without Maeve?

47:32.520 --> 47:35.240
She's the key
to your whole weird operation.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.960
Which is why it's over.

47:37.040 --> 47:40.520
I've known you since you were
nine years old, and you're never happier

47:40.600 --> 47:43.320
than when you're talking to people
about their genitals.

47:43.800 --> 47:46.360
I thought you wanted to be involved
for the status.

47:47.160 --> 47:48.400
I'm doing all right on my own.

47:49.840 --> 47:52.640
Talk... to... her.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.120
Do it.

48:07.240 --> 48:09.000
-Hey.
-Hi.

48:14.280 --> 48:15.920
Do you want your old job back?

48:17.280 --> 48:18.160
Back?

48:19.880 --> 48:20.720
I created it.

48:21.800 --> 48:23.080
Now I'm not interested.

48:23.560 --> 48:24.400
I need you.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.480
You never wanted to do this
in the first place, Otis.

48:28.160 --> 48:29.000
Why not just drop it?

48:30.400 --> 48:31.760
Because we're good at it.

48:32.560 --> 48:33.400
And...

48:34.200 --> 48:37.800
I'm learning things, which I know
sounds crazy, but it's true.

48:40.000 --> 48:40.880
Come on.

48:41.680 --> 48:43.920
I'll up your cut, 55 percent.

48:45.440 --> 48:47.440
-Seventy.
-Sixty.

48:51.520 --> 48:52.560
Deal.

48:53.640 --> 48:55.680
-This is entirely about the money.
-Yeah.

48:57.600 --> 48:59.280
It's good to be back in business.
