00:20.653 --> 00:24.521
One hundred and sixty-three!
This whole page is wrong.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.994
I'm sorry, Miss Ashley,
but I'm trying to keep this place tidy.

00:31.064 --> 00:34.830
Lord Fowler and his daughter
Lady Penelope will be here soon.

00:34.934 --> 00:36.993
Why are you nervous about it?

00:37.070 --> 00:40.836
Lord Fowler gave me my first job
as a full-fledged butler.

00:41.274 --> 00:43.902
And he's one of
the most important men in Britain.

00:43.977 --> 00:46.810
Well, I wouldn't want to embarrass you.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.371
British people have really good manners.

00:49.449 --> 00:52.316
I used to be intimidated by the British.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.286
I thought they were superior
in taste, style, and breeding.

00:55.355 --> 00:57.220
<i>Then I saw Benny Hill.</i>

01:01.061 --> 01:04.997
<i>Master Carlton.
First of all, I like Benny Hill.</i>

01:06.533 --> 01:09.001
Secondly, while Lord Fowler is here...

01:09.069 --> 01:12.436
I must ask you to keep
wisecracks like that to yourself.

01:12.639 --> 01:15.107
During his stay, I want all of you children...

01:15.175 --> 01:17.871
to maintain an air of quiet dignity.

01:27.987 --> 01:29.477
Geoffrey, mon!

01:29.756 --> 01:31.587
Do the limbo with me.

01:34.027 --> 01:38.726
This is precisely what cannot happen
when Lord Fowler arrives.

01:39.332 --> 01:42.233
Yo, G. What's my name? The Prince, right?

01:42.302 --> 01:44.668
I know how to deal with royalty.

01:44.904 --> 01:48.340
Don't worry.
I'll be at the peak of Schweppervescence.

01:48.741 --> 01:51.141
Check it out. You be the English dude.

01:51.211 --> 01:52.542
Very well.

01:52.745 --> 01:54.542
Pleased to meet you, William.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.208
And I am honored to meet you,
Lord Fowler.

03:13.226 --> 03:14.523
Aunt Vivian.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.387
Beautiful American woman.

03:19.999 --> 03:22.092
What you thinking you're up to, boy?

03:24.571 --> 03:28.473
All right. Check it out, Aunt Viv.
Ziggy Marley's in concert next weekend...

03:28.541 --> 03:30.975
and I was wondering,
maybe I could use the car?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.341
Where's the concert?

03:32.412 --> 03:34.903
- Just around the corner.
- Where around the corner?

03:35.515 --> 03:36.504
Nevada.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.115
Forget it, baby.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.747
Uncle Phil, mon!

03:43.890 --> 03:47.018
You are generous, fair-minded,
and very sexy.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.927
You've already gotten your allowance.

03:50.997 --> 03:53.227
For that, I am very thankful, mon.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.297
He wants to drive
to a Ziggy Marley concert in Nevada.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.500
That's an easy one. No.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.998
Come on, Uncle Phil. Why not?

04:02.075 --> 04:05.306
Every time you take that car to a concert,
something happens to it.

04:05.378 --> 04:08.609
- Like what?
- A mysterious dent, a broken taillight...

04:08.681 --> 04:11.616
a mural of Nia Peeples painted on the side.

04:12.151 --> 04:15.814
I swear to you guys
that was on the car when I got in it.

04:17.523 --> 04:20.548
You're not responsible enough
to drive to a concert in Nevada.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.957
All right. If in this next week...

04:23.029 --> 04:25.463
I can prove to you
I'm responsible, can I go?

04:25.531 --> 04:28.989
Sounds like a low-risk proposition.
You're on.

04:30.536 --> 04:32.265
That's Lord Fowler.

04:41.981 --> 04:44.074
- Lord Fowler.
- Geoffrey.

04:44.150 --> 04:47.779
And Lady Penelope. My, you look lovely.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.383
Thank you, Geoffrey.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.980
And this is Mr. And Mrs. Banks.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.218
How do you do?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.818
Very nice to meet you.
How was your flight?

04:55.895 --> 04:58.762
It was a bit choppy and quite long.

04:58.831 --> 05:02.631
And of course, the food was horrid
and the movie was a dreadful bore.

05:02.702 --> 05:05.102
I wouldn't want to make
that journey too often.

05:05.171 --> 05:06.365
I should think not.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.802
Won't you come in?

05:13.079 --> 05:15.707
Philip, why are you talking like that?

05:16.082 --> 05:17.413
Like what?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.449
That ridiculous British accent.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.648
Whenever you're around
an English person, you slip right into it.

05:23.723 --> 05:28.126
The first three months Geoffrey was here,
I could barely understand you.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.555
I have no idea what you're talking about.

05:30.630 --> 05:33.656
Sir, madam, care to join us for tea?

05:33.733 --> 05:34.722
Right-o.

05:42.141 --> 05:45.907
Lady Penelope.
Wow, it must be great being a Lady.

05:45.978 --> 05:49.277
Spending all your time shopping,
going to lunch with your friends...

05:49.349 --> 05:52.716
and just sitting around
being waited on hand and foot.

05:52.785 --> 05:54.844
I wonder what that would be like.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.985
One can only imagine.

06:02.028 --> 06:05.589
Actually, I go to a small convent school
and the nuns work us very hard.

06:05.665 --> 06:09.533
We scrub the floors, cook the meals and
on the weekends, we do all the laundry.

06:09.602 --> 06:11.001
What a gyp.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.035
We're looking forward
to taking you to dinner tonight.

06:16.109 --> 06:19.510
Splendid. Dinner will be a perfect time
for me to bring you all...

06:19.579 --> 06:22.514
up to date on the new bills
pending before Parliament.

06:22.615 --> 06:26.346
We've made some fascinating strides
in maritime legislation.

06:26.419 --> 06:28.444
I'll go into greater details at dinner.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.617
Is tonight a school night?

06:34.761 --> 06:36.991
No. I already thought of that.

06:37.997 --> 06:40.989
Mr. And Mrs. Banks,
I hope I'm not being terribly rude...

06:41.067 --> 06:43.501
but I was counting on seeing
the opera tonight.

06:43.569 --> 06:47.528
But, my dear, I don't want you
going out alone in a strange city.

06:47.607 --> 06:48.972
You'll need an escort.

06:49.275 --> 06:52.676
An escort. You mean a responsible escort.

06:53.112 --> 06:56.309
A young man who could take
Lady Penelope out tonight...

06:56.382 --> 06:58.714
and return her home safe and sound.

06:58.785 --> 07:01.583
The same type of young man
who could be trusted...

07:01.687 --> 07:04.713
to drive to a Ziggy Marley concert
in Nevada.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.052
I suppose so.

07:11.464 --> 07:14.297
- Would you really take me, Will?
- Absolutely.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.392
If it's all right with Uncle Phil.

07:16.602 --> 07:17.694
Okay, Will.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.364
You may take Lady Penelope to the opera.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.772
Opera? I thought she said "Oprah."

07:27.313 --> 07:29.304
<i>Spider-Man comics.</i>

07:30.249 --> 07:31.807
Watchman.

07:32.819 --> 07:36.084
Goobers, Raisinets.

07:36.422 --> 07:38.720
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

07:39.025 --> 07:41.892
- Where do you think you're going?
- To the opera.

07:43.196 --> 07:46.131
Did you see
what I did with my spitball straw?

07:46.699 --> 07:50.157
Now, you just listen to me,
you irresponsible vagabond.

07:51.537 --> 07:54.335
I want you on your best behavior tonight.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.130
No. Let me revise that.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.508
I want you
on a normal person's best behavior.

08:00.713 --> 08:02.237
Mr. Belvesneer.

08:03.883 --> 08:07.319
The whole point of tonight
is to prove that I'm responsible.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.047
How hard can it be?

08:09.121 --> 08:11.646
I'll take her to the opera, cop a few "Z's"...

08:11.724 --> 08:12.918
bring her back home.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.653
This weekend I'm with Ziggy.

08:14.927 --> 08:17.623
Master William,
I just hope you recognize...

08:17.697 --> 08:20.029
the seriousness of the task at hand.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.624
Why are you tripping? She's just a girl.

08:22.702 --> 08:26.263
Just a girl? Master William...

08:26.339 --> 08:30.503
if 895 members of the royal family
instantly died...

08:30.910 --> 08:33.434
she would be the next queen of England.

08:37.216 --> 08:39.376
Now, where does that put me?

08:40.653 --> 08:42.587
But the astounding thing...

08:42.655 --> 08:46.682
about the Fisheries and Hatcheries Act
of 1624...

08:46.759 --> 08:50.991
is hardly the bill itself,
but rather its unique place...

08:51.063 --> 08:54.191
in the entire 800-year history...

08:54.267 --> 08:56.633
of maritime legislation.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.303
I'll go into greater detail at the restaurant.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.975
Does this restaurant have a bar?

09:07.113 --> 09:09.411
If it doesn't, we'll build one.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.077
I can't believe Geoffrey
has done this to us.

09:12.151 --> 09:14.619
This is going to be
the longest night of our lives.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.382
The only thing that'll make it better...

09:16.455 --> 09:18.616
is knowing Will has to sit through
an opera.

09:18.691 --> 09:21.455
At this point,
that's the only thing I have to cling to.

09:21.994 --> 09:23.552
I don't feel so good.

09:23.629 --> 09:26.723
Don't even try it, Ashley.
We're all in this together.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.570
- Father, have a lovely time at dinner.
- Thank you, my dear.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.541
- And I hope you enjoy the opera.
- I shall.

09:37.610 --> 09:40.408
I always find the opera so uplifting.
Goodbye, Geoffrey.

09:40.479 --> 09:41.969
Goodbye, Lady Penelope.

09:42.281 --> 09:43.805
Master William.

09:44.183 --> 09:46.083
Do not forget what I said to you.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.448
Goodbye, Father dear. I shall miss you.

09:57.863 --> 10:00.024
I thought the old buzzard
would never leave.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.760
Will, got a smoke?

10:04.170 --> 10:07.799
- Excuse me?
- I've been dying for a cigarette all day.

10:08.574 --> 10:12.032
No, I don't have any cigarettes.
I don't smoke and you shouldn't either.

10:12.111 --> 10:15.046
- It's bad for you.
- Sod off, mother superior.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.174
Don't nobody call me a mother nothing.

10:22.388 --> 10:25.721
And what's up with you?
Who are you, Dr. Jekyll and Patty Duke?

10:27.426 --> 10:29.223
Don't be such a wanker.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.957
I only put on
that innocent schoolgirl routine...

10:32.031 --> 10:33.225
for the old man.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.057
Routine? You've been lying to the Lord?

10:37.336 --> 10:39.429
Whenever we go to the city,
I tell my father...

10:39.505 --> 10:42.633
that I'm dying to go to the opera
knowing full well he detests it.

10:42.708 --> 10:46.769
That way, I can hit the clubs. I thought
we'd go downtown to the Meat Hook.

10:46.846 --> 10:49.906
The Meat Hook?
That's the roughest bar in L.A.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.610
Super. That's what Lady Cicely told me.
Let's go.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.844
Wait, wait. Baby, you ain't going nowhere.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.019
Geoffrey put me in charge of you.

10:58.090 --> 11:01.617
So you can just shake
your royal booty on up them steps.

11:02.762 --> 11:05.322
You can't boss me around.
You're not a nun.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.834
Hold on. See, now,
that's where you made your mistake.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.428
See, I'm a plainclothes nun.

11:14.073 --> 11:17.133
Yeah, that's right.
They call me Sister Sledge.

11:20.112 --> 11:22.979
I hate you!
You've just ruined my whole night!

11:23.049 --> 11:24.676
You've ruined everything!

11:27.086 --> 11:29.646
Man, this babysitting thing is easy.

11:35.561 --> 11:37.722
Lady, come back with my car!

11:50.509 --> 11:53.569
- Yo, man. Should I get the bouncer?
- I am the bouncer.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.314
Follow your red queen. Keep your eyes
on the red card. $10 will get you $20.

11:59.685 --> 12:03.052
Who saw it? Come on, boys, don't be shy.
$10 will get you $20.

12:11.430 --> 12:14.888
Awfully glad you could make it.
Feel lucky? $10 will get you $20.

12:15.601 --> 12:18.661
- No way. Look, we're out of here.
- Forget it.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.798
This place is a blast.
The people here are so interesting.

12:21.874 --> 12:24.570
<i>Yeah. I think I saw that guy
on Unsolved Mysteries.</i>

12:26.579 --> 12:29.309
Look. Lady Penelope, we are going home.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.277
No, I'm not.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.887
I'm mad about this song.
Dance with me, Will.

12:36.956 --> 12:40.119
- I'm not dancing with you.
- Loosen up, homes.

12:40.192 --> 12:44.356
Come on. Get up and dance.
Shake your moneymaker.

12:45.464 --> 12:49.662
Lady Penelope, I got a Ziggy Marley
concert on the line. Let's go.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.626
You can't touch this!

12:53.072 --> 12:56.269
Go, Lady! Go, Lady!

12:59.445 --> 13:01.106
Will you get down from here?

13:01.180 --> 13:02.204
Hi, Otis.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.875
Hey, punk.
You're dancing with my woman.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.418
No. You got it all wrong.
I'm not dancing with her.

13:07.486 --> 13:10.284
I'm trying to get her to go home with me.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.117
I'll bet you are.

13:12.691 --> 13:16.058
Man, what are you, crazy? Back up!

13:30.943 --> 13:34.310
So that brings us up to 1907...

13:34.880 --> 13:37.906
which, in maritime law circles...

13:37.983 --> 13:42.044
has come to be known
as "The Year of the Trout."

13:43.489 --> 13:45.514
I saw that sweater first!

13:48.561 --> 13:49.892
Excuse me.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.596
Lord Fowler.

13:53.232 --> 13:57.498
Wasn't there quite a row
in the House of Lords in 1912...

13:57.570 --> 13:59.629
when they repealed the Tuna Laws?

14:00.105 --> 14:02.630
Geoffrey, that's a very long story.

14:03.142 --> 14:05.838
It all began in 1910.

14:06.178 --> 14:10.478
Sir, before you continue,
would anyone care for anything?

14:10.816 --> 14:12.147
A lobotomy.

14:13.485 --> 14:16.045
Perhaps a drop of sherry, Geoffrey.

14:16.655 --> 14:18.919
So, anyway, as I was saying...

14:18.991 --> 14:23.291
I recently came upon
a very interesting article on the subject...

14:50.256 --> 14:53.623
...1910 brought a tuna shortage...

14:54.026 --> 14:57.757
to the southern shores of Cornwall,
Penzance in particular.

14:59.765 --> 15:03.633
The vote, which should interest you,
was as follows...

15:03.969 --> 15:08.599
D.E. Chesterton, yea,
Sir Rudolf Tetherbury...

15:10.910 --> 15:13.572
Master William. What are you doing here?

15:13.646 --> 15:16.342
Why aren't you with Lady Penelope
at the opera?

15:16.448 --> 15:19.713
Opera?
G, she's never seen an opera in her life.

15:19.785 --> 15:22.720
I'm telling you,
she's been fronting the whole time.

15:22.788 --> 15:25.848
How dare you besmirch
the reputation of a British Lady.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.718
G, the Lady is a tramp.

15:31.697 --> 15:35.963
She stole the car, she snuck out
to the roughest bar in town...

15:36.335 --> 15:38.860
and then she hooked up
with a human Godzilla.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.102
Master William,
are you telling me the truth?

15:42.708 --> 15:44.573
<i>I swear on a stack of TV Guides.</i>

15:46.278 --> 15:49.714
Master William, if we don't bring her home
safe and sound...

15:49.782 --> 15:52.080
Lord Fowler will never forgive me.

15:52.217 --> 15:54.913
Your uncle will lose faith in me.

15:55.154 --> 15:58.453
I'll never work again,
and my career will be ruined.

15:59.558 --> 16:02.618
Can we try to keep
this in perspective here, G?

16:03.162 --> 16:05.630
I'm not going to get to see Ziggy.

16:07.366 --> 16:10.164
We must go to that bar
and bring her back.

16:10.669 --> 16:11.897
To the Batmobile.

16:13.405 --> 16:16.431
Shame on Lady Penelope.
When she was a little girl...

16:16.508 --> 16:20.035
I always told her
there is no excuse for lying.

16:21.780 --> 16:23.213
The Labor party...

16:23.282 --> 16:26.308
Milord, I'm afraid I have some bad news.

16:26.385 --> 16:30.048
My cousin Roddy has just been
suddenly struck with malaria.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.887
I must go to quarantine immediately.

16:42.134 --> 16:44.364
Yo, G, this is a rough crowd.

16:44.870 --> 16:47.338
You gotta watch
what you say around here.

16:47.406 --> 16:49.203
What do you mean, thank you?

16:56.148 --> 16:58.343
That's the guy
that Lady P. Was dancing with.

16:58.684 --> 17:02.745
- But where's Lady Penelope?
- He could be hiding her in his fist.

17:03.822 --> 17:07.280
- I shall have to have a word with him.
- Careful, G.

17:07.358 --> 17:10.328
Not to worry.
I know how to handle his sort.

17:13.965 --> 17:18.335
What have you done with Lady Penelope,
you knuckle-dragging swine?

17:24.309 --> 17:25.674
She's gone.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.279
- Gone?
- Yeah.

17:29.615 --> 17:33.016
- She broke up with me.
- Where is she?

17:33.285 --> 17:37.085
Really, I don't know.
She said she wanted to go for a ride...

17:37.189 --> 17:40.022
so I took her to the parking lot
and put her on my bike.

17:40.092 --> 17:41.957
And then I turned around to spit...

17:42.027 --> 17:45.929
and the next thing I know,
she took off on my Harley.

17:47.399 --> 17:50.562
Man, I know how you feel.
We better keep looking.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.729
Nonsense. The man's a liar.

17:53.505 --> 17:55.769
Tell us what you've done
with Lady Penelope...

17:55.841 --> 17:58.332
or I shall be forced to thrash you.

18:00.512 --> 18:03.675
Don't press him, G.
You saw what he did to Tokyo.

18:06.318 --> 18:08.013
Don't worry, Master William.

18:08.153 --> 18:11.554
In my youth,
I was quite a Greco-Roman wrestler.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.537
So then Churchill said to the king:

18:27.639 --> 18:29.300
"You're ugly."

18:30.142 --> 18:32.167
To which the king replied:

18:32.311 --> 18:34.677
"And you, sir, are fat."

18:39.384 --> 18:41.784
Or was it the other way round?

18:41.854 --> 18:45.290
Anyhow, they went on like that for hours.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.053
Are you sure there isn't any more sherry?

18:48.794 --> 18:51.058
Anyway, this dispute took place...

18:51.130 --> 18:54.099
at the height of the Flounder Rebellion.

18:54.733 --> 18:57.634
- Mommy.
- God bless you, sweetheart.

18:59.771 --> 19:02.467
- What's the matter, baby?
- I can't sleep.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.736
Just sit around here for a little while.

19:06.178 --> 19:07.543
I'll take you up, baby.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.476
You're not going anywhere, woman.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.643
- Sorry, Mommy. I tried.
- Try again in 10 minutes.

19:24.029 --> 19:26.054
Now, where was I?

19:26.398 --> 19:29.094
God. If you don't know, I have no idea.

19:32.571 --> 19:35.734
How are we going to tell Lord Fowler
we lost his daughter?

19:35.807 --> 19:39.402
I'll break the news, Master William.
You're young.

19:39.778 --> 19:42.372
You have your whole life ahead of you.

19:42.447 --> 19:45.382
It's best I bear the brunt
of the punishment.

19:46.385 --> 19:48.683
You got a point there. Good luck.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.981
Geoffrey, how's your cousin Roddy?

19:52.057 --> 19:54.992
I regret to tell you,
I have no cousin Roddy.

19:55.427 --> 19:56.860
Damn malaria.

19:59.631 --> 20:01.724
No. You don't understand.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.401
What I'm about to tell you
is very difficult to say.

20:05.804 --> 20:08.739
Geoffrey,
it's not more gambling debts, is it?

20:08.807 --> 20:11.503
I thought we had that productive chat.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.174
Sir, it isn't that.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.214
It's about this evening.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.510
And I have to accept full responsibility.

20:19.718 --> 20:23.381
Yo, G. Hold up.
I can't let you go out like this, man.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.046
This is all my fault.

20:25.257 --> 20:28.317
Will, why aren't you at the opera
with Lady Penelope?

20:28.393 --> 20:29.417
All right.

20:29.494 --> 20:32.019
Tonight,
my plan was to take her to the opera...

20:32.097 --> 20:34.122
and return her home safe and sound.

20:34.199 --> 20:38.033
But Lady Penelope had other plans
and it just didn't work out like that.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.697
Hello, all. I had a smashing time tonight.

20:40.772 --> 20:43.138
My dear. How was the opera?

20:43.208 --> 20:45.369
It was the most wonderful opera I've seen.

20:45.444 --> 20:47.969
- Why wasn't Will with you?
- But he was.

20:48.146 --> 20:49.738
And he was the perfect escort.

20:49.815 --> 20:52.215
But around the third act,
Will was starting to fade...

20:52.284 --> 20:54.149
so I told the poor dear to go on home.

20:54.219 --> 20:56.119
He left me
with more than enough cab fare.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.156
Thank you so much, Will.

20:58.790 --> 20:59.814
You're good.

21:00.892 --> 21:03.190
So, what's all the fuss about?

21:03.262 --> 21:06.857
Will made it up to the third act,
which is more than I could've done.

21:06.965 --> 21:11.197
An evening of opera.
I can't imagine anything more boring.

21:12.571 --> 21:13.663
I can.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.967
Geoffrey, I'm surprised at you,
getting all hot and bothered...

21:19.044 --> 21:21.535
just because the boy
ducked out of it early.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.047
It's nothing
compared with your old exploits.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.175
There's no need to go into that, milord.

21:26.251 --> 21:29.812
I seem to recall a time
that you were caught in the gazebo...

21:29.888 --> 21:32.948
after that randy game of strip croquet.

21:34.593 --> 21:37.653
But I've told enough stories
for one evening.

21:37.729 --> 21:39.754
No, I want to hear this one.

21:40.866 --> 21:42.356
No. It's late.

21:42.434 --> 21:45.597
- Perhaps next visit.
- No. Now. We've earned it.

21:47.005 --> 21:48.370
No. I'm sorry.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.102
That's the mark of a great storyteller.

21:51.176 --> 21:53.303
Always leave them wanting more.

21:55.947 --> 21:58.177
Good night, Geoffrey. Night-night, Will.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.311
Next time I'm in town,
we'll have to go to the ballet.

22:03.388 --> 22:05.253
Yeah. I'm looking forward to that.

22:07.959 --> 22:11.156
Well, Will, you certainly proved
that you're responsible.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.561
- That's right.
- You took Lady Penelope out...

22:13.632 --> 22:16.829
and you brought her back
without a hair out of place as promised.

22:16.902 --> 22:18.369
Yep. Just like I promised.

22:18.437 --> 22:21.895
So, I guess you can use the car
next weekend after all.

22:22.474 --> 22:24.465
Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil.

22:25.544 --> 22:29.105
Just one thing, Will, out of curiosity.

22:29.448 --> 22:32.076
Since that explanation
that Lady Penelope rattled off...

22:32.150 --> 22:36.587
was obviously a complete crock,
what really did happen tonight?

22:40.659 --> 22:44.151
You should sit down.
It's going to be a long story, Uncle Phil.

22:45.030 --> 22:48.227
No. Never mind. Enjoy the concert.
