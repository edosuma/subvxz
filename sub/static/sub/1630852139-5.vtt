WEBVTT

00:21.960 --> 00:23.400
-Come!
-How many are these?

00:23.480 --> 00:26.720
-You're 40, so...
-I'm 40, not 40,000.

00:26.800 --> 00:27.880
Hey, lil Francesco.

00:27.960 --> 00:31.760
He was only 40
but they seemed 100 to me.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.320
It was a different time, though.

00:33.840 --> 00:37.480
Back then 40-year-olds,
especially in the eyes of a child,

00:38.080 --> 00:39.440
seemed a lot older.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.440
40, 60...
I couldn't pinpoint their age.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.600
They were just "grown-ups."

00:45.680 --> 00:46.680
Hey, Cri'.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.000
How do I look?

00:50.760 --> 00:52.840
-Good.
-Not in that sense.

00:53.160 --> 00:58.880
I mean, when I was a kid,
my father was an old man to me.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.200
Understand?

01:00.840 --> 01:02.520
Is this about you turning 40, Dad?

01:06.600 --> 01:08.760
Nowadays, a man in his forties
is still a youngster.

01:09.440 --> 01:13.520
That's how I felt a few days
away from turning 40.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.880
Don't act so cool.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.360
I felt the strength
and willpower of a kid.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.400
Hey! Hey!

01:19.480 --> 01:20.760
Apart from a few ailments.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.880
I felt, as they say in Rome,
"20 years old per leg."

01:25.720 --> 01:28.720
That's the first 20 taken care of.
Other leg, now.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.040
You'll feel like a baby again.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.600
Which doesn't mean 40.
It means 20, twice.

01:32.680 --> 01:33.520
Easy.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.480
Which is a lot different.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.960
-Number 1, Wojciech...
-Szczęsny!

01:38.960 --> 01:42.480
-Number 2, Antonio...
-Rüdiger!

01:43.080 --> 01:46.160
-Number 20, Federico...
-Fazio!

01:46.240 --> 01:50.160
-Number 44, Kostas...
-Manōlas!

01:50.760 --> 01:53.760
-Number 33, Emerson...
-Palmieri!

01:54.240 --> 01:57.520
-Number 16, Daniele...
-De Rossi!

01:57.960 --> 02:01.640
-Number 6, Kevin...
-Strootman!

02:01.720 --> 02:05.160
-Number 11, Mohamed...
-Salah!

02:05.240 --> 02:08.960
-Number 92, Stephan...
-El Shaarawy!

02:09.040 --> 02:13.160
-Number 4, Radja...
-Nainggolan!

02:13.240 --> 02:16.960
-Number 9, Edin...
-Džeko!

02:18.280 --> 02:19.320
On the sidelines...

02:20.400 --> 02:24.080
He was born a soccer player,
grew up a myth

02:24.160 --> 02:26.280
and now, a legend.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.200
Thank you, Captain.

02:28.280 --> 02:32.040
-Number 10, Francesco...
-Totti!

02:32.120 --> 02:33.280
TOTTI: ONE CAPTAIN

02:33.960 --> 02:35.160
LAST CHAMPIONSHIP

02:35.480 --> 02:38.680
Baldy... I mean coach...
has me play four out of six matches.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.560
All 90 minutes, in one case.
And I even scored.

02:41.760 --> 02:46.080
Penalty kick, but still a goal.
You can't take it for granted.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.960
You could say the season
had started well.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.320
That's why I didn't think
it was a good idea to...

02:52.200 --> 02:56.720
-Honey, the fuck did you do?
-Hey, language! I'm with the baby.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.960
-She doesn't understand.
-You think?

02:59.040 --> 03:00.600
Then, one day, she says...

03:00.680 --> 03:02.560
The baby talked! She said...

03:04.240 --> 03:05.560
You deal with your mother, then.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.560
Forget about my mother.
What's this?

03:07.640 --> 03:10.040
How could you say that?
Do you even realize?

03:10.120 --> 03:11.160
Me? What did I say?

03:11.240 --> 03:15.480
Francesco had
a very hard time last year.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.680
They never let him play.

03:17.760 --> 03:21.920
He always sat there, humbly waiting.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.200
I don't criticize the tactical choice,
but I do question its humanity.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.040
Spalletti acted like a small man.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.440
Listen, you think so, I say so.
I have nothing to hide.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.240
I told him what I thought.
He knows.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.680
But I tell him, not the papers.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.200
You should know by now,
it stays in the locker room.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.560
-I'm not in the locker room.
-Soon I won't be either.

03:49.640 --> 03:54.200
I can't forget your look,
how humiliated you felt.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.320
I couldn’t keep it to myself.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.000
What now?

04:03.920 --> 04:06.680
-Is it that serious?
-I can't face another year of war.

04:06.760 --> 04:10.240
We can't either.
He let him play, then he didn't...

04:10.320 --> 04:13.840
Just three minutes, but then he scored.
Put him in, take him out...

04:13.920 --> 04:16.600
He's the eighth king of Rome!

04:16.680 --> 04:18.400
I'll have to patch things up.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.240
Coach!

05:43.120 --> 05:45.280
I'd like to invite you
to my 40th birthday party.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.000
Thank you.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.080
I... We would very much like
for you to come.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.560
If I come, will your friends
ambush me and beat me up?

05:58.680 --> 06:00.800
If they beat you up,
it means you deserve it, right?

06:04.400 --> 06:07.720
-He didn't say he'd come.
-Well, you were nice to tell him.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.520
I don't even know what I'd prefer.

06:12.440 --> 06:17.440
What's the use of inviting someone
to my birthday party

06:18.040 --> 06:19.840
who'd rather see me hanging?

06:19.920 --> 06:21.280
Stop thinking about it.

06:21.360 --> 06:24.800
It's your party.
Just think about having fun.

06:24.880 --> 06:25.920
I don't know.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.320
SEPTEMBER 27TH, 2016

06:32.200 --> 06:33.360
What is it now?

06:34.360 --> 06:35.360
It seems a bit much.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.520
-What?
-The castle, all this.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.840
It wasn't that, obviously.
We even got married there.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.800
Turning 40 is bad enough.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.880
But for a soccer player

06:48.960 --> 06:51.880
quitting is a proper nightmare,
so you ask yourself...

06:52.360 --> 06:53.920
What the hell
am I celebrating for?

06:54.680 --> 06:55.680
Like you said, then.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.840
Let's go have fun.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.280
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.200
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:21.840 --> 07:22.800
Hey.

07:24.440 --> 07:25.960
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.680
Man. Wrong shampoo?

07:51.840 --> 07:54.160
-Happy birthday, Checco.
-Thank you, coach.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.640
Best wishes
from the bottom of my heart.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.400
Thank you.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.360
You shouldn't have. Really, coach.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.000
-You don't recognize it?
-It's beautiful.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.760
It's the DeLorean from  Back to the Future .
The time machine.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.160
So you can take a trip
and decide what to do.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.200
Whether to go back or forward.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.040
Anything you want,
as far as I'm concerned.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.600
And even though it's your birthday

08:21.680 --> 08:26.880
I got a small gift
for your lovely wife too.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.080
For me?

08:29.160 --> 08:30.840
-Yes.
-Thank you.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.480
"Piccolo uomo."
(Small Man)

09:53.680 --> 09:56.120
-Oh, there you are!
-Hey.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.080
-What are you doing?
-Just looking.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.040
Do you think...

10:03.800 --> 10:06.360
When they did the portraits,
were they still in business?

10:06.440 --> 10:09.480
-What do you mean, "in business"?
-Still alive, I mean.

10:10.760 --> 10:11.720
I don't know.

10:12.760 --> 10:13.600
Who knows.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.800
Still, nice sense of humor, huh?

10:18.960 --> 10:20.000
Yup.

10:20.360 --> 10:21.720
-I'd say.
-Quite so.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.320
Like I'd bought him a wig.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.800
Did you know my grandfather
only had one leg?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.520
-Really?
-I swear. He had one leg.

11:06.960 --> 11:07.960
Scared the hell out of me.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.880
-Why are you telling me now?
-I dreamed of him last night.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.320
Don't be afraid, France'.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.680
He told me not to be afraid.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.280
You should listen, then.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.640
I'm not afraid.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.320
I'm glad to hear that.

11:44.560 --> 11:48.280
But I was afraid,
and rightly so.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.800
'Cause it all ended that evening,
like inCinderella.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.840
When you reach 40...

11:56.120 --> 11:57.440
...the spell ends.

11:59.160 --> 12:03.480
My years and my coach weren't gone.
They were in cahoots.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.760
My birthday is September 27th.

12:08.840 --> 12:09.840
DECEMBER 2016

12:10.440 --> 12:13.320
Between my ailments
and Spalletti's tactics

12:13.400 --> 12:15.920
I played 15 minutes
from then to December.

12:16.440 --> 12:20.240
15 minutes in seven matches.
A quarter of an hour.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.320
You're lucky I was here,
or it would have broken.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.600
Yeah, that'd be bad luck.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.840
We're blaming bad luck, now?

12:44.400 --> 12:46.320
You're here to bust my balls
on Christmas, too?

12:46.400 --> 12:48.720
No, I'm here
to talk about miracles.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.720
-What miracles?
-The kind you used to work on the field.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.840
To be fair, you can't call them miracles
if they work every time...

12:57.200 --> 12:58.800
-You got that right.
-Listen, France'...

12:59.560 --> 13:02.800
A goal, an assist,
a champion's gambit.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.920
You played 15 minutes,
but didn't do anything special.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.680
Just get out, will you?
It's not a good moment. Go.

13:08.760 --> 13:12.040
Imagine if you had, though.
Could you have healed the sick, too?

13:12.600 --> 13:13.960
Anto'! Still running your mouth?

13:14.040 --> 13:17.040
You still haven't figured out
when to be a jerk and when not to be.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.880
APRIL 25TH, 2010

13:18.960 --> 13:20.040
The 2009-2010 tournament.

13:20.120 --> 13:23.080
If we defeat Sampdoria,
the Championship is ours.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.560
And who's playing for them?

13:24.640 --> 13:27.040
Mark my words,
I'll make you lose the Championship.

13:27.120 --> 13:30.440
-You little...
-Send him away!

13:31.800 --> 13:34.000
-Just one goal less than...
-Anto', come on.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.520
Cassano again, he goes for it...
He did it! Goal!

13:37.600 --> 13:40.400
A devastating defeat,
an incredible result.

13:40.480 --> 13:45.040
On one side, the happiness
of Sampdoria's players.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.960
On the other, the sadness
and despair of Roma's players

13:48.040 --> 13:51.640
who see their dream shatter
right on the finish line

13:51.720 --> 13:54.120
a dream that seemed
to be at their fingertips.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.400
-Well, what did I say?
-Son of a--

14:15.280 --> 14:17.960
How would you feel,
stewing on the bench for two months?

14:19.080 --> 14:20.840
-Same as you.
-Right.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.560
Look at reality, look at it,
take a good look.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.520
That's what I'm doing!
It's always before my eyes.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.680
-He won't let me play.
-First, the femoral biceps injury.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.080
-So?
-Then the hip problem.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.920
-The intestinal virus.
-Are you his attorney?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.600
Pal, being 40
doesn't mean being 20 twice.

14:36.040 --> 14:39.200
I know. It's not like I'm asking
to play 90 minutes.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.760
But 15 minutes
over two months? Come on.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.280
What do you care, anyway?
Who do you think you are?

14:46.160 --> 14:47.360
Just a messenger.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.160
A messenger of what?

14:51.080 --> 14:53.040
All the people who love you.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
A stand-in for those
who want to see you happy.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.640
For what you did, for what you had

15:01.720 --> 15:03.360
and above all, for what you have.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.320
Come on, tell me you understand.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.080
Let's say I do.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.680
I wouldn't tell you, of all people.

15:29.640 --> 15:30.600
I'm fine with that.

15:31.480 --> 15:32.400
Merry Christmas.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.440
Honey, don't buy the torroncini
next year.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.440
Yesterday you complained
there weren't any.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.120
But you know I end up
eating them all.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.240
I'll take her to bed.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.480
Come on, let's go to bed.
It's late.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.360
-Are you taking her to bed?
-Yes. A kiss?

16:11.440 --> 16:12.280
Bye.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.520
Bye. Bye.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.920
Merry first Christmas.
It's your first Christmas, huh?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.560
-It is!
-Nice.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.480
You, too, get to bed.
Go on, Chanel, Cristian.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.120
-No, come on.
-Go on, go to bed.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.320
-I'm not sleepy.
-Fra'.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.360
Cri', go to bed.
It's 2 am. It's late.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.480
-You like it? Nice, huh?
-Yes.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.960
-Turn it off now, or you won't sleep.
-All right.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.680
The screen's light will keep you up.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.440
-OK, goodnight.
-Bye.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.040
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye, Cri'.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.400
-Merry Christmas.
-Thanks.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.640
Let's go!

17:00.880 --> 17:03.320
Dad, can I sleep in these?

17:04.240 --> 17:05.360
Of course you can.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.480
-Don't tell Mom.
-I won't.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.360
You're provoking me, huh?

17:17.960 --> 17:21.360
-Stop. You'll take it out on me.
-I'm not eating it.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.200
Even Vito said not to.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.000
The tournament break
is almost over.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.120
Yeah, we're starting again.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.760
The agony, too.

17:33.560 --> 17:38.360
-That's what it is, agony.
-Don't think about it on Christmas.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.560
Shall we go to bed?

17:43.080 --> 17:45.720
I told Cassano
the same thing, too.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.560
-Did he call you?
-Who?

17:47.920 --> 17:49.000
Cassano.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.840
-No.
-No?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.560
-Cassano?
-Yeah.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.080
No, he wrote...

17:55.160 --> 17:57.760
He called for Christmas greetings.
Like every year.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.000
I think you were right.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.520
I should have quit.

18:10.720 --> 18:11.840
After Torino.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.800
I thought I'd play another year,
but instead...

18:19.600 --> 18:21.240
You like it
when I say you're right, huh?

18:22.680 --> 18:24.840
-It's not that.
-You do, though.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.080
I'm smiling
because you understood.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.440
If you understand,
you'll stop being so upset.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.320
Shall we go to sleep?

18:42.560 --> 18:43.640
Let's go.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.560
But I didn't stop
being upset about it.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.160
Here, put it here.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.440
Two. Go!

19:03.360 --> 19:05.480
In fact, I felt worse.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.840
And at a certain point...

19:11.600 --> 19:13.360
I no longer even cared about training.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.240
I can't take it anymore.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.080
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:37.880 --> 19:41.040
What's all this for?
I'm training like an idiot.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.800
I've never trained so much
in my whole life.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.080
But it's useless.
He won't let me play.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.840
-Fra'...
-"Fra'" what, Vito?

19:47.920 --> 19:49.400
"Fra'" what? He won't let me.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.320
-Forget it.
-Yeah.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.560
All I care about
is that you're aware.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.200
Of what?

19:56.280 --> 19:58.120
If you stop training,
things won't improve.

19:58.480 --> 20:03.000
Vito, I'm not just 40 in my legs.
I am up here, too.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.680
When you're 20,
you can afford to eat shit

20:05.760 --> 20:09.080
'cause you've got 15 more
ahead of you, but I can't.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.160
You think I don't know that?

20:10.240 --> 20:12.920
If you're a 40-year-old
with something yet to give

20:13.000 --> 20:16.520
you need someone
to manage your legs  and  your head.

20:16.760 --> 20:20.480
You know how many minutes
I've played since September? 33.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.080
-Vito, 33.
-I know, France'.

20:23.160 --> 20:26.280
-No, you don't. 33.
-I know and I get it.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.560
But if you stop training now,
what do you think will happen?

20:34.080 --> 20:36.320
That Baldy'll leave
at the end of the season.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
Someone who respects me will come.
You know that, Vito.

20:42.320 --> 20:45.480
If I train, I'll get back in shape.
You know that, too.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.640
It can't end like this.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.520
Something must happen.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.920
As a matter of fact,
something did.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.320
-He didn't hint at anything?
-Nothing.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.040
If he came all the way here,
it must be important.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.480
Who knows.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.880
I just talked to the president.
He says hello.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.680
Thanks.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.480
He wanted to make sure you knew
he is your number one fan.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.760
Yeah, I saw that.

21:41.400 --> 21:45.120
Francesco, don't mix up esteem,
affection and gratitude

21:45.200 --> 21:49.480
for all you've given us,
with the club's technical choices.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.480
If I am here today,
it's because you...

21:53.920 --> 21:54.920
are special.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.080
You are Roma.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.720
And we don't want to make
the same mistakes as last year

22:00.800 --> 22:02.200
in handling your renewal.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.880
Do we agree on that?

22:05.280 --> 22:06.640
Well, that depends.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.840
We won't do anything
you don't agree with.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.720
It still depends
on what you want to do with me.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.240
We're against Lazio this Sunday.
The Rome derby.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.240
Do you want to make
the announcement?

22:23.480 --> 22:26.160
-The announcement?
-That it will be your last derby.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.640
My last derby?

22:39.760 --> 22:43.400
Yes. If you want to say
or do something special, I don't know...

22:43.480 --> 22:44.440
Me?

22:45.920 --> 22:48.960
-It only seems right.
-You're saying it's the last one.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.640
No, Francesco,
the contract says that.

22:52.320 --> 22:53.400
We had agreed.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.560
We thought it a show
of respect towards you

22:56.640 --> 22:59.880
to give you the choice
of saying it as you...

22:59.960 --> 23:02.680
The choice? If I am to choose,
it won't be the last one.

23:04.520 --> 23:07.360
Be reasonable, Francesco.
There's an agreement.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.000
At the end of the season,
you will switch to management.

23:12.720 --> 23:17.000
So, if you want to hold
a press conference, an interview...

23:17.400 --> 23:19.120
Whatever you decide is fine with us.

23:19.200 --> 23:23.520
You decided it's the last one,
and you want it to look like it's my choice

23:24.160 --> 23:26.760
If you people want it,
you'll say it. I won't say anything.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.040
You were right to say
it was up to them.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.200
But a year goes by quickly

23:36.280 --> 23:39.120
and you should've prepared
for this moment to come.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.880
I really thought
I could make it this year, too.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.320
You were right.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.640
A year goes by quickly, love.

24:07.840 --> 24:11.760
I never would've said
the words "the end".

24:11.840 --> 24:16.480
Someone had said it for me,
which didn't help me accept it.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.320
Because I...

24:23.080 --> 24:24.320
I just wasn't ready.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.120
Everyone said
I should've prepared mentally.

24:32.520 --> 24:36.000
If they told you that you've
a year left to live, what would you do?

24:36.720 --> 24:38.160
Wouldn't you always think about it?

24:41.680 --> 24:42.720
Close it properly.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.320
-How did it go?
-Fine.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.080
"Fine"? That's it?

25:37.040 --> 25:38.520
You try not to think about it.

25:45.480 --> 25:48.760
It's not easy when something
has been your whole life

25:48.920 --> 25:52.160
and everything around you
reminds you of it.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.200
What's with this breadcrumb trail?

26:04.880 --> 26:07.520
-France', how can I say it?
-What?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.880
-What do you mean, "what"?
-I tidied up.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.040
Did you?

26:12.160 --> 26:13.240
More or less.

26:15.600 --> 26:16.720
Dear Lord.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.920
-He's already there?
-He's waiting for you.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.000
He's so different from me, huh?

26:31.720 --> 26:35.760
-He cleaned it. Dried it, too.
-Yeah, he cherishes it.

26:37.880 --> 26:38.880
He does.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.760
He never talks to me about soccer,
not a thing.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.360
He talks to me about it.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.680
-Oh, he talks to you?
-Yes.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.880
You still don't know
what "touchline" means.

26:52.680 --> 26:53.600
What does he say?

26:55.400 --> 26:57.680
That he likes it. He says...

26:58.120 --> 27:01.400
You know. How the game was,
how the training's going.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.320
You know what Dad told me
all his life?

27:08.440 --> 27:09.440
You're no good.

27:10.680 --> 27:11.720
Got that?

27:14.200 --> 27:16.320
Bye, love. See you later.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.840
Chanel?

27:24.600 --> 27:25.720
What's the difference?

27:26.200 --> 27:27.640
Think about it, or don't.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.120
When you reach
the end of something,

27:31.320 --> 27:36.720
something you don't want to end...
a journey, a relationship...

27:37.800 --> 27:38.840
A life.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.360
The truth is, you're never ready.

27:45.840 --> 27:49.360
APRIL 26TH, 2017

27:49.720 --> 27:50.800
Romulus.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.160
Numa Pompilius.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.640
Tullus Hostilius.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.160
Ancus Marcius.

27:59.480 --> 28:00.560
Tarquinius Priscus.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.840
Servius Tullius.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.280
Tarquinius Superbus.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.640
Francesco Totti!

28:11.040 --> 28:14.000
On the 25th anniversary
of the Roma team captain's career

28:14.080 --> 28:18.480
Totti's technical sponsor
has created a limited edition shoe

28:18.560 --> 28:23.000
for the legendary player to wear
on Sunday, in the derby against Lazio.

28:48.920 --> 28:51.760
Come on, guys.
This is it. Come on!

28:52.880 --> 28:53.920
Come on!

29:23.040 --> 29:24.120
Don't think about it.

29:26.040 --> 29:29.000
When it’s your turn, you tell me
if you can stop thinking about it.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.000
-I don't want to think about it.
-Then don't.

29:34.040 --> 29:37.680
I don’t want to think about...
coming in and you not being here.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.920
You'll be rid
of that shitty nickname!

29:44.800 --> 29:49.480
-At least that. "Captain Future".
-What can I say? I had bad luck.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.440
Little bit.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.800
Being born here
with someone like you above me.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.600
You had me wait a long time.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.320
You know what?

30:01.400 --> 30:04.440
For you, I would have
accepted "Captain Never".

30:10.440 --> 30:12.200
Come on, Lazio's out there.
Let's go.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.560
-Let's go, Captain.
-Go on.

31:30.920 --> 31:35.680
It wasn't a good game for us.
A defeat we didn't want.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.320
Now the race to the Champions League
gets more complicated.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.760
Only 17 minutes for Totti.
Could he have played longer?

31:40.840 --> 31:43.560
You'd have to ask the coach.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.280
What about contracts?
Have you talked about it?

31:45.360 --> 31:47.000
Will Totti get
another year with Roma?

31:47.760 --> 31:50.480
I've only been here a week.

31:51.720 --> 31:55.560
All I know, all I've heard

31:55.640 --> 31:57.600
is that there's a signed agreement.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.480
A done deal, signed a while ago.

32:00.640 --> 32:04.120
It's his last year as a player,
rather than an executive...

32:04.200 --> 32:06.320
They brought him in
all the way from Spain!

32:06.440 --> 32:11.040
From Seville, to give us the great news.
Bastards!

32:11.880 --> 32:12.920
Fla'?

32:14.600 --> 32:15.480
Fla'!

32:16.720 --> 32:17.800
Honey.

32:18.440 --> 32:20.360
We don't have pets.

32:22.520 --> 32:23.600
His last derby...

32:24.560 --> 32:25.760
I can't do this.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.240
I was thinking...

32:38.640 --> 32:39.880
of the first time...

32:40.800 --> 32:42.520
I came to see you play the derby.

32:46.640 --> 32:47.720
Don't.

32:48.680 --> 32:51.520
If you start crying...
I'll never stop.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.280
Shit...

32:56.200 --> 32:58.000
You're right.
I'm sorry. It's just...

32:59.000 --> 33:03.520
I kept telling you to prepare,
and I forgot to.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.800
You'll make me cry as well.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.480
I'm sorry.

34:09.320 --> 34:11.920
That's what I miss the most.
The smell of the grass.

34:16.360 --> 34:19.160
Sometimes at home I mow the lawn,
just to smell it.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.640
First you break my balls,
now you go all sentimental?

34:28.360 --> 34:30.280
Sorry, I know.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.800
I was a bit harsh,
but I did it for you.

34:34.680 --> 34:36.240
Because I know how hard it is.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.440
I've been through it.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.200
See that guy?

34:45.360 --> 34:46.720
He went the whole way.

34:47.680 --> 34:52.280
Width-wise, length-wise,
midfield, penalty area.

34:53.640 --> 34:54.920
He must do it all.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.400
And once he has...

35:00.720 --> 35:01.720
He's done.

35:02.360 --> 35:03.400
Exactly.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.040
That's where you are now.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.400
You've reached the end.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.320
Good thing you wanted to apologize.

35:18.440 --> 35:19.440
No.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.360
He did a good job.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.320
And went back home.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.280
Happy.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.040
Everything ends, sooner or later.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.560
Some say that's
what makes life good.

36:27.320 --> 36:30.240
If things lasted forever,
they wouldn't matter.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.080
But that doesn't make it hurt less.
