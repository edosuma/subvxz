WEBVTT

00:02.273 --> 00:03.334
(gunfire and explosions)
STAY SHARP, GUYS.
WE GOTTA WIN TONIGHT.

00:03.334 --> 00:04.675
WE CANNOT GO TO GAME SEVEN.
SURE WE CAN.

00:04.675 --> 00:06.006
THE TOURNAMENT'S
THE BEST OF SEVEN,

00:06.006 --> 00:08.139
SO WE DEFINITELYCANGO
TO GAME SEVEN.

00:08.139 --> 00:11.082
HAD YOU SAID, "I PREFER NOT
GOINGTO GAME SEVEN"

00:11.082 --> 00:13.044
OR "WESHAN'TGO
TO GAME SEVEN,"

00:13.044 --> 00:15.046
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE ACCURATE.
AND MORE ELOQUENT.

00:15.046 --> 00:17.688
WHATEVER. THESE TOURNAMENT GAMES
GO ON LATE, AND I WAKE THERESA

00:17.688 --> 00:21.052
WHEN I GET IN BED, WHICH SHE
SHASN'TBEEN HAPPY ABOUT.

00:21.052 --> 00:22.593
I'D REALLY LIKE TO WRAP
THIS UP TONIGHT,

00:22.593 --> 00:24.455
SO I NEED YOU TO FOCUS.

00:24.455 --> 00:27.458
YOU GOT IT, BUDDY. SO, KENNY,
HOW'S THE NEW EGG CHAIR?

00:27.458 --> 00:28.799
FANTASTEESH.

00:28.799 --> 00:31.702
I PUT IN SURROUND SOUND
AND A BUTT WARMER.

00:31.702 --> 00:33.464
I GOT A BEVERAGE TUBE.

00:33.464 --> 00:35.035
It's like
a giant robot chicken

00:35.035 --> 00:36.637
LAID THIS
JUST FOR MY COMFORT.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.209
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA
FOCUS THEN?

00:38.209 --> 00:40.471
OF COURSE WE ARE. HEY, CRAIGGER,
HOW'S THE NEW GIRL?

00:40.471 --> 00:42.543
DOES SHE REALLY JUST LIKE
WATCHING YOU PLAY VIDEO GAMES?

00:42.543 --> 00:45.376
(chuckles) YEP. SHE IS GREAT.

00:45.376 --> 00:46.717
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU,
SUNSHINE.

00:46.717 --> 00:48.219
(chuckles) FOCUS, HONEY.

00:48.219 --> 00:49.520
YOU DON'T WANT THIS TOURNAMENT
GOING TO GAME SEVEN.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.082
(whispers) YEAH.

00:51.082 --> 00:52.083
(normal voice) THAT'S HOW WILL
SHOULD HAVE SAID IT.

00:52.083 --> 00:54.085
I'M TAKING FIRE, GUYS.

00:54.085 --> 00:56.487
WHO'S GOT MY BACK?
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:56.487 --> 00:58.489
I'M RELOADING
THE SANGRIA RESERVOIR.

00:58.489 --> 01:00.391
I'M TOTALLY FOCUSED, BILL.

01:00.391 --> 01:01.562
(warping sound)

01:01.562 --> 01:04.064
AND WE'RE GOING
TO GAME SEVEN.

01:04.064 --> 01:12.072
AW! I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA TRY
AND WRAP THIS UP TONIGHT!

01:12.072 --> 01:14.745
ISN'T IT FANTASTIC?
I'VE WANTED A FAMILY PORTRAIT

01:14.745 --> 01:16.807
LIKE THIS
EVER SINCE WE HAD KIDS.

01:16.807 --> 01:20.311
OH, MY GOODNESS. WHY ARE
YOU ALL SO SMALL AND FLAT?

01:20.311 --> 01:23.254
(chuckles) I'M JUST KIDDING.
THAT'S MY IMPRESSION

01:23.254 --> 01:25.356
OF THE FIRST GUY
WHO EVER SAW A PAINTING.

01:25.356 --> 01:27.418
(chuckles) LOOKS LIKE
THE ARTIST GOT A LITTLE GENEROUS

01:27.418 --> 01:29.120
WITH YOUR CLEAVAGE.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.091
YEAH, HE INSISTED
MY BODY TYPE COULD HANDLE IT.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.623
HE SAID I'LL GET USED TO THEM.

01:32.623 --> 01:35.426
YEAH.
GOOD MORNING. (sighs)

01:35.426 --> 01:38.229
THAT'S A NICE-LOOKING FAMILY
GATHERED AROUND THOSE BOOBS.

01:38.229 --> 01:40.100
HOW'D YOU SLEEP?

01:40.100 --> 01:43.604
TERRIBLE. YOU WOKE ME UP
WHEN YOUFINALLYCAME TO BED,

01:43.604 --> 01:45.105
AND THE NEIGHBOR'S STUPID
MOTION DETECTOR LIGHT

01:45.105 --> 01:48.139
WAS GOING OFF AGAIN ALL NIGHT,
SHINING IN OUR WINDOW.
HUH?

01:48.139 --> 01:50.781
OUR NEW NEIGHBOR IS A JERK.
IT'S NOT JUST THE LIGHT.

01:50.781 --> 01:51.782
EVERY TIME THE KIDS LOSE
A BALL OVER HIS FENCE,

01:51.782 --> 01:53.284
HE REFUSES TO GIVE IT BACK.

01:53.284 --> 01:55.286
I HAVE NO TOLERANCE
FOR THAT.

01:55.286 --> 01:57.688
WILL, YOU NEED TO GO OVER THERE
AND GET YOUR BALLS BACK.

01:57.688 --> 02:00.291
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A METAPHOR, BUT IT IS NOT,

02:00.291 --> 02:02.353
BECAUSE THAT MAN HAS
YOUR ACTUAL BALLS,

02:02.353 --> 02:05.256
WHICH ALSO SOUNDS LIKE
A METAPHOR AND ALSO IS NOT.

02:05.256 --> 02:06.297
OH, I TALKED TO HIM.

02:06.297 --> 02:08.599
BELIEVE ME,
WE REALLY WENT AT IT.

02:08.599 --> 02:10.701
HI, GLENN.

02:10.701 --> 02:12.303
WHAT?

02:12.303 --> 02:13.464
SO I-I WAS TRYING TO FISH
MY KIDS' BALLS

02:13.464 --> 02:15.306
OUT OF YOUR BACKYARD
WITH MY RAKE,

02:15.306 --> 02:18.169
AND SO N-NOW YOU ALSO HAVE
MY RAKE... (chuckles)

02:18.169 --> 02:20.911
UH, AND MY LONGER RAKE,
AND--OKAY.

02:20.911 --> 02:22.813
WELL, AT LEAST YOUR STUPID
VIDEO GAME TOURNAMENT IS OVER

02:22.813 --> 02:26.146
SO I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
YOUWAKING ME UP ANYMORE.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.219
YEAH, UH, UH, ABOUT THAT...

02:28.219 --> 02:30.921
UH, THE TOURNAMENT'S NOT
ACTUALLY OVER.

02:30.921 --> 02:32.553
YOU SAID IT WAS ONLY GONNA
BE SIX GAMES.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.656
I OVERESTIMATED
MY TEAM'S FOCUS...

02:35.656 --> 02:37.488
IN THAT I THOUGHT
THEY HAD ANY.

02:37.488 --> 02:38.759
UGH.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.461
BUT IT'S OKAY. I DON'T HAVE
TO PLAY TONIGHT.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.732
(chuckles) I MEAN,
THE--YOU KNOW, THE GUYS ARE

02:41.732 --> 02:44.295
SUPER EXCITED ABOUT IT,
AND IT ONLY HAPPENS ONCE A YEAR,

02:44.295 --> 02:47.298
BUT, UH... I CAN SKIP IT,
(inhales deeply)

02:47.298 --> 02:49.670
EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST
ONE MORE NIGHT...

02:49.670 --> 02:51.171
AND I LOVE IT.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.674
THANK YOU, HONEY.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.276
I APPRECIATE IT.

02:57.748 --> 02:59.680
MM.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.412
YOU TOLD HER
YOU WEREN'T GONNA PLAY?

03:01.412 --> 03:04.355
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
THIS TOURNAMENT IS AS IMPORTANT

03:04.355 --> 03:06.417
AS ANYTHING WE WILL EVER DO
IN OUR LIVES, RIGHT?

03:06.417 --> 03:07.718
IF ANYTHING,
YOU'RE UNDERSTATING IT.

03:07.718 --> 03:10.321
YOU KNOW, GUYS, WE WOULDN'T
EVEN HAVE THIS PROBLEM

03:10.321 --> 03:11.722
IF YOU'D HAD MY BACK
LAST NIGHT

03:11.722 --> 03:13.824
INSTEAD OF MAKING OUT
WITH YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND

03:13.824 --> 03:16.497
AND MESSING
WITH YOUR SANGRIA TANK.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.229
THERE WAS A CHUNK OF ORANGE
STUCK IN MY DRINKING TUBE.

03:18.229 --> 03:20.331
DID YOU WANT ME
TO JUST LEAVE IT THERE?

03:20.331 --> 03:21.932
IT COULD HAVE CHOKED ME, WILL.

03:21.932 --> 03:23.304
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.475
FIRST YOU ENDANGER
OUR ENTIRE TOURNAMENT,

03:24.475 --> 03:26.307
AND NOW YOU WANT KENNY
TO DIE?

03:26.307 --> 03:27.308
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

03:27.308 --> 03:29.880
I GOT IT.
I GOT THE SOLUTION.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.384
FORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
I'M A PHARMACEUTICAL REP...
(thud)

03:33.384 --> 03:34.915
WITH A BAGFUL OF TRICKS,

03:34.915 --> 03:36.317
ONE OF WHICH IS...

03:36.317 --> 03:37.918
(plastic rustles)

03:37.918 --> 03:39.620
WONUNOL.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.853
"WHEN YOU CAN'T SLEEP,
TAKE WONUNOL.

03:42.853 --> 03:44.725
"REMEMBER--WONUNOL.

03:44.725 --> 03:48.359
TAKE ONE... Y'ALL.
YEE-HAW! SLEEP."

03:48.359 --> 03:49.730
THEY'RE STILL WORKING
ON THE CAMPAIGN.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.233
ANYWAY, IT'S ALL NATURAL.
THERE'S NO HANGOVER,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.366
AND IT'S TINY, SO YOU CAN HIDE
ONE IN THERESA'S APPLESAUCE.

03:55.366 --> 03:57.608
I'M NOT GONNA HIDE DRUGS
IN MY WIFE'S FOOD.

03:57.608 --> 03:58.809
(both) OH, COME ON.

03:58.809 --> 04:00.971
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I'M GONNA PLAY TONIGHT.

04:00.971 --> 04:04.515
I'LL JUST LIE TO THERESA
AND TELL HER I'M NOT GOING TO,

04:04.515 --> 04:07.548
THEN I'LL WEAR MY SILK PAJAMAS,
AND WHEN SHE'S ASLEEP,

04:07.548 --> 04:09.620
I'LL SLIP OUT OF BED
LIKE A NINJA,

04:09.620 --> 04:13.253
A COMFORTABLE NINJA
WHO'S USED TO THE FINER THINGS.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.588
(sighs)
I FINISHED MY HOMEWORK.

04:17.588 --> 04:18.989
CAN I GO TO BED EARLY?

04:18.989 --> 04:21.392
ARE YOU SNEAKING OUT TONIGHT?
STEALING A CAR?

04:21.392 --> 04:22.733
HITTING THE CLUBS?

04:22.733 --> 04:25.436
NO, I JUST ATE TOO MUCH PIE,
AND I WANT TO GO TO BED.

04:25.436 --> 04:26.937
(chuckles)
NATHAN, IT'S OKAY.

04:26.937 --> 04:29.039
YOUR FATHER'S JUST KIDDING.
OF COURSE YOU CAN GO TO BED.

04:29.039 --> 04:30.471
YOU GOT A GIRL UP THERE?

04:30.471 --> 04:31.472
MOM!

04:31.472 --> 04:33.774
IT'S TOO EASY. (chuckles)

04:33.774 --> 04:35.706
LUCY, YOU GO GET READY, TOO.
I'LL BE RIGHT UP.

04:35.706 --> 04:39.450
GOD, I HAVEN'T SLEPT MORE THAN
TWO HOURS IN A ROW THIS WEEK.

04:39.450 --> 04:40.851
IF ANYONE WAKES ME UP
AGAIN TONIGHT,

04:40.851 --> 04:42.413
I SWEAR I'M GONNA KILL THEM
TO DEATH,

04:42.413 --> 04:45.716
AND PLEASE DON'T WEAR
THOSE SILK PAJAMAS YOU TOOK OUT.

04:45.716 --> 04:48.018
REALLY? WHY NOT?

04:48.018 --> 04:50.461
WELL, THEY GET ALL STATICKY,
AND THEN I KEEP GETTING SHOCKED.

04:50.461 --> 04:51.792
I FEEL LIKE I'M SLEEPING
WITH SOMEONE

04:51.792 --> 04:53.494
WHO'S TRYING TO GET
INFORMATION OUT OF ME.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.895
(sighs) HUH.

04:54.895 --> 04:58.399
YOU KNOW, I WAS TALKING
TO KENNY ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM,

04:58.399 --> 05:01.332
AND--AND HE'S KINDA LIKE
A DOCTOR,

05:01.332 --> 05:03.404
AND HE GAVE ME THIS...
THING.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.905
(chuckles)
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

05:04.905 --> 05:08.579
THIS GREAT NEW...
SLEEP SUPPLEMENT OR SOMETHING.

05:08.579 --> 05:09.640
YOU TRYING TO KNOCK ME OUT
SO YOU CAN PLAY

05:09.640 --> 05:11.442
YOUR STUPID VIDEO GAME?

05:11.442 --> 05:15.315
WHAT?I TOLD YOU,
I AM NOT PLAYING TONIGHT.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.987
I'M JUST TRYING
TO HELP YOU SLEEP,

05:16.987 --> 05:19.420
AND THIS PILL'S SUPPOSED
TO BE AMAZING.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.422
I DON'T LIKE PILLS.
IT'S NOT A PILL.

05:21.422 --> 05:25.396
IT'S REALLY MORE OF, UH,
AN ORGANIC SLEEP VITAMIN

05:25.396 --> 05:31.862
WITH METABOLISM-BOOSTING,
UH, ANTI-AGING... MOLECULES.

05:31.862 --> 05:35.005
I THINK ONE OF THE ACTRESSES
FROM "MAD MEN" TAKES IT.

05:35.005 --> 05:36.837
REALLY?

05:36.837 --> 05:38.809
THAT IS A SMART SHOW.

05:40.471 --> 05:42.613
(gunfire and explosions)
WE ARE GOOD TO GO,

05:42.613 --> 05:44.044
and we still have
an hour to practice

05:44.044 --> 05:45.416
BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT
STARTS.

05:45.416 --> 05:46.717
SO THERESA'S SLEEPING?

05:46.717 --> 05:48.849
YEP. I GOT HER TO TAKE
THE WONUNOL.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.951
THAT'LL DO IT. THAT THING
WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED

05:50.951 --> 05:52.883
AS A HORSE TRANQUILIZER.

05:52.883 --> 05:54.785
They just changed
the formula for humans...

05:54.785 --> 05:57.388
(whispers)
BY CUTTING IT IN HALF.

05:57.388 --> 05:59.730
YOU GAVE MY WIFE
A HORSE TRANQUILIZER?

05:59.730 --> 06:03.934
NO,YOUGAVE YOUR WIFE
HALFA HORSE TRANQUILIZER.

06:03.934 --> 06:06.567
Will, it's fine.
Trust in science.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.038
PILLS MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER.

06:08.038 --> 06:10.070
IN TEN YEARS, WE WON'T EVEN
NEED PEOPLE ANYMORE.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.042
IT'LL JUST BE PILLS GIVING
EACH OTHER PILLS.

06:12.042 --> 06:13.704
Yeah, there'll be
pill police officers.

06:13.704 --> 06:14.705
THERE'LL BE PILL FIREMEN.

06:14.705 --> 06:15.976
(chuckling)
The pill president.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.878
HE'LL BE PILL CLINTON.
(chuckles)

06:17.878 --> 06:19.450
DAD?

06:19.450 --> 06:23.053
I THREW UP PIE--
LOTS AND LOTS OF PIE,

06:23.053 --> 06:24.715
MORE PIE THAN I ATE.

06:24.715 --> 06:26.386
DID SHE SAY
SHE THREW A PIE?

06:26.386 --> 06:29.660
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.
GUYS, I MIGHT HAVE A SITUATION.

06:29.660 --> 06:31.462
DAD, UH,
I DON'T FEEL SO WELL.

06:31.462 --> 06:33.824
(retches and coughs)

06:33.824 --> 06:35.726
OHH! WILL, WHAT'S GOING ON
OVER THERE?
(liquid splatters)

06:35.726 --> 06:38.168
I DEFINITELY HAVE
A SITUATION.

06:38.168 --> 06:42.533
UGH. THAT SOUND.
GOD, I MISS COLLEGE.

06:46.837 --> 06:47.908
JUST GONNA THROW THESE SHEETS
IN THE WASH, KIDS.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.441
STAY IN THE BATHROOM AND AIM
FOR ANYTHING PORCELAIN.

06:50.441 --> 06:51.712
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

06:51.712 --> 06:52.813
UH, WE KNEW
YOUR HANDS WERE FULL,

06:52.813 --> 06:54.815
SO WE BROUGHT THE TVs OVER
SO YOU CAN PLAY.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.447
AND WE'VE STILL GOT
A HALF AN HOUR

06:56.447 --> 06:57.718
TILL THE GAME STARTS,

06:57.718 --> 06:59.019
SO, UH, WE'RE GONNA TEACH
GRANT HOW TO PLAY,

06:59.019 --> 07:01.722
AND THEN HE CAN SUB IN FOR YOU
WHEN YOU GET DISTRACTED

07:01.722 --> 07:03.994
BY THE DISGUSTING VOMITORIUM
THAT IS YOUR HOME.

07:03.994 --> 07:04.955
ALTHOUGH I'VE NEVER DONE
THIS BEFORE,

07:04.955 --> 07:07.728
I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.
MY ONLY QUESTION IS--

07:07.728 --> 07:11.201
I DEPLORE VIOLENCE--IS THERE
A BUTTON ON HERE FOR DIPLOMACY?

07:11.201 --> 07:12.803
WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK, WILL.

07:12.803 --> 07:14.505
YOU DON'T HAVE MY BACK.
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO BAIL

07:14.505 --> 07:15.736
ON THE TOURNAMENT.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.008
DON'T DO THIS, WILL.
NOT IN FRONT OF GINA.

07:18.008 --> 07:19.970
OH, THIS IS GINA. (chuckles)

07:19.970 --> 07:23.113
HEY, WILL. I'M GINA.
DON'T DO THIS IN FRONT OF ME.

07:23.113 --> 07:24.214
COME ON, MAN.
I DROVE ALL THE WAY HERE

07:24.214 --> 07:25.916
WITH MY EGG CHAIR ON TOP
OF MY CAR.

07:25.916 --> 07:27.918
IF THAT'S NOT HAVING YOUR BACK,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

07:27.918 --> 07:28.919
THAT'S NOT HAVING MY BACK!

07:28.919 --> 07:30.050
THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS!

07:30.050 --> 07:32.653
GUYS, THE GAME IS NOT REALLY
MY PRIORITY RIGHT NOW.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.886
MY KIDS HAVE A STOMACH BUG,
SOMEBODY DRUGGED MY WIFE...

07:35.886 --> 07:36.887
YOU.

07:36.887 --> 07:38.559
AND I'M GONNA GO START
SOME LAUNDRY.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.562
YOU HAVE A LOVELY HOUSE.
DO YOU MIND IF I LOOK AROUND?

07:41.562 --> 07:44.234
YEAH, SURE. I JUST MET YOU.
WANDER AROUND MY HOME.

07:44.234 --> 07:47.037
(Nathan) DAD, CAN I HAVE
A GLASS OF WATER?

07:47.037 --> 07:50.771
I GOT THIS, WILL. I HAVE
A SOOTHING EFFECT ON THE INFIRM

07:50.771 --> 07:52.703
AND, FOR SOME REASON,
THE DOWNTRODDEN

07:52.703 --> 07:55.646
AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
THE MISBEGOTTEN.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.811
SO... DO YOU LIKE GINA?

08:00.811 --> 08:01.982
YEAH, SURE. WHY NOT?

08:01.982 --> 08:05.115
SHE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYBODY,
BUT SHE'S A KLEPTOMANIAC.

08:05.115 --> 08:07.918
SHE HAS CLAWS
INSTEAD OF HANDS?

08:07.918 --> 08:09.790
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT A KLEPTOMANIAC IS.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.062
OH.
IT'S SOMEBODY WHO HAS
A COMPULSION TO STEAL THINGS.

08:12.062 --> 08:13.093
IT'S A DISEASE.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.725
WELL, IF SHE HAS
A STEALING DISEASE,

08:14.725 --> 08:16.797
SHOULD WE BE LETTING HER WALK
AROUND WILL'S HOUSE

08:16.797 --> 08:17.928
LOOKING FOR THINGS TO STEAL?

08:17.928 --> 08:19.029
ACCORDING TO HER THERAPIST,

08:19.029 --> 08:21.001
I'M SUPPOSED TO SHOW HER
THAT I TRUST HER.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.933
BESIDES, WILL DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING THAT GREAT ANYWAY.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.940
I'M A BUMBLEBEE,
AND I NEED TO SEE THE MOON,

08:29.940 --> 08:33.113
BECAUSE IT HELPS ME
NAVIGATE.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.145
KARATE CHOP!

08:40.050 --> 08:41.822
THAT WAS WEIRD.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.555
AND SHE'S NAKED
FROM THE WAIST DOWN.

08:44.555 --> 08:46.026
THAT'S VERY UNLIKE HER.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.559
I THINK I NEED TO CHECK
SOMETHING ONLINE.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.101
(grunts)

08:51.101 --> 08:53.063
(thuds)
HEY.

08:53.063 --> 08:55.866
SO, UM, CRAIG'S KEEPING
AN EYE ON THE KLEPTOMANIAC.

08:55.866 --> 08:57.137
WHAT?

08:57.137 --> 08:58.538
RIGHT. LET ME BACK UP.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.941
UH, HEY, WILL... (chuckles)
GINA'S A KLEPTOMANIAC.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.743
WHAT?
(whispers) I KNOW!

09:02.743 --> 09:03.874
(normal voice) BUT YOU'VE
GOT A BIGGER PROBLEM.

09:03.874 --> 09:04.915
THERESA'S UP.

09:04.915 --> 09:06.977
OH, GOD! WHAT--NO--

09:06.977 --> 09:08.548
DID SHE SEE
ALL THE GAME STUFF?

09:08.548 --> 09:12.082
I AM SO BUSTED. YOU SAID
SHE WAS GONNA SLEEP ALL NIGHT!

09:12.082 --> 09:13.083
I DIDN'T SAY SHE'S AWAKE.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.785
(sighs)
I SAID SHE'S UP.

09:14.785 --> 09:16.086
I JUST WENT ONLINE,

09:16.086 --> 09:17.087
AND I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH
ON WONUNOL.

09:17.087 --> 09:18.789
ONE OF
THE OCCASIONAL SIDE EFFECTS

09:18.789 --> 09:22.162
IS WALKING AROUND IN
A DREAM STATE WITH NO PANTS ON,

09:22.162 --> 09:25.936
DUE TO AN INSATIABLE URGE
TO AIR-COOL THE LOWER TORSO,

09:25.936 --> 09:28.138
COMMONLY CALLED
"WINNIE THE POOHING."

09:28.138 --> 09:29.139
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S DOING?

09:29.139 --> 09:30.200
VERY MUCH SO.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.106
THAT'S A NICE VASE.

09:36.106 --> 09:38.949
MAN, WILL AND THERESA WOULD
REALLY MISS THAT VASE

09:38.949 --> 09:41.652
IF ANYBODY TOOK IT,
WHICH I'M SURE NO ONE WILL.

09:41.652 --> 09:46.116
THANK YOU. IT FEELS
SO GREAT WHEN YOU TRUST ME.

09:46.116 --> 09:48.859
HERE. I WANT TO GIVE YOU BACK
YOUR MEAT THERMOMETER.

09:48.859 --> 09:52.322
THIS IS NOT MINE,
BUT THANK YOU.

09:52.322 --> 09:54.294
DON'T STEAL THE VASE.
DON'T STEAL THE VASE.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.826
DON'T STEAL THE VASE.

09:55.826 --> 09:57.628
DON'T STEAL THE VASE.
DON'T STEAL THE VASE.

09:57.628 --> 09:59.029
DON'T STEAL THE VASE.

09:59.029 --> 10:00.100
(Brenda) HELLO?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.101
NO.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.272
WHERE'S THERESA?

10:02.272 --> 10:04.134
SHE SENT ME AN E-MAIL
ASKING ME IF I WANTED

10:04.134 --> 10:06.376
TO MAKE PANCAKES
WITH STING.

10:06.376 --> 10:07.808
OBVIOUSLY, YES, I DO,

10:07.808 --> 10:09.379
BUT SOMETHING JUST
DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT.

10:09.379 --> 10:11.141
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
FALSE ALARM.

10:11.141 --> 10:13.043
GO BACK TO YOUR WITCH FARM.

10:13.043 --> 10:15.145
IS THAT MY EGG CHAIR?

10:15.145 --> 10:17.147
DID YOU TAKE THAT OUT
OF MY GARAGE?

10:17.147 --> 10:19.619
NO, THAT ISMYEGG CHAIR
THAT YOU SPITEFULLY TOOK

10:19.619 --> 10:21.852
IN OUR DIVORCE
THAT YOU NEVER USE.

10:21.852 --> 10:24.755
(Gina) YOU TOLD YOUR FRIENDS
I HAVE KLEPTOMANIA!

10:24.755 --> 10:25.896
(Craig) IT'S NOTHING TO BE
ASHAMED OF.

10:25.896 --> 10:28.098
IT'S THE MOST COMMON MANIA
TO HAVE,

10:28.098 --> 10:29.329
AFTER WRESTLE AND BEATLE.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.360
WHAT WAS THAT?

10:30.360 --> 10:32.102
THAT WAS CRAIG.
YOU KNOW CRAIG.

10:32.102 --> 10:33.704
THE KIDS ARE BACK IN BED.
(sighs)

10:33.704 --> 10:36.366
WHY ARE YOU HERE? (sighs)

10:36.366 --> 10:38.108
HELLO, BRENDA. (chuckles)

10:38.108 --> 10:39.770
I WON'T INSULT
YOUR INTELLIGENCE.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.241
THERE'S SOME TOMFOOLERY
GOING ON AROUND HERE,

10:41.241 --> 10:43.113
AND I'M UP TO MY ANKLES IN IT.

10:43.113 --> 10:45.345
YOU--BRENDA! (chuckles)

10:45.345 --> 10:48.078
UH, THERESA AND I--WE WERE,
UH, JUST OUT FOR A WALK,

10:48.078 --> 10:51.181
BUT, UH, SHE'S TIRED
AND SO WON'T BE SPEAKING.

10:51.181 --> 10:53.253
GOOD EVENING, MADAM.
YOUR TABLE IS ALMOST READY.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.085
(laughs) EXCEPT FOR THAT.

10:55.085 --> 10:57.788
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.661
(laughs)

11:05.265 --> 11:08.238
GIVE US BACK OUR BALLS!

11:12.242 --> 11:14.945
HEY, WILL.
WE GOT YOUR BACK.

11:14.945 --> 11:17.778
OH, GOD.
NOW WHAT DID YOU DO?

11:17.778 --> 11:19.309
THEY TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

11:19.309 --> 11:21.952
WE TRIED NOT TO,
BUT THEN SHE ASKED.

11:21.952 --> 11:24.154
LOOK, WONUNOL'S BEEN TESTED
EXTENSIVELY,

11:24.154 --> 11:26.116
AND PATIENTS DON'T REMEMBER
A THING THE NEXT MORNING.

11:26.116 --> 11:28.458
OF COURSE, MOST OF
THOSE PATIENTS WERE HORSES,

11:28.458 --> 11:30.020
BUT STILL,
WE SHOULD BE FINE

11:30.020 --> 11:32.192
AS LONG AS BRENDA KEEPS
HER VODKA CHUTE SHUT.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.094
YEAH, THAT'S WINNING ME OVER.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.096
BRENDA, IT WOULD
REALLY BE GOOD

11:36.096 --> 11:38.228
IF THERESA DIDN'T KNOW THAT
I TALKED HER INTO TAKING

11:38.228 --> 11:40.871
AN ALL-NATURAL
CLYDESDALE ROOFIE.

11:40.871 --> 11:42.472
I WON'T SAY A THING...

11:42.472 --> 11:46.006
(Lucy) DADDY, I THREW UP
IN MY BED AGAIN!

11:46.006 --> 11:48.178
COMING, HONEY!

11:48.178 --> 11:52.482
I'LL EVEN HELP WITH THE KIDS,
AS LONG ASASSQUATCH

11:52.482 --> 11:54.945
GIVES ME BACK MY CHAIR
IN ITS ORIGINAL CONDITION

11:54.945 --> 11:56.246
BEFORE THERESA WAKES UP.

11:56.246 --> 11:59.719
WHAT?! NO WAY.
THAT'S A TERRIBLE DEAL, GUYS.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.951
LET'S WALK.

12:00.951 --> 12:02.192
HEY, WAIT. COME ON. KENNY!

12:02.192 --> 12:03.754
YOU'RE ON THE HOOK
FOR THIS, TOO.

12:03.754 --> 12:05.425
IF THERESA FINDS OUT
WHAT HAPPENED,

12:05.425 --> 12:07.197
SHE WILL HOLD YOU DOWN
AND FORCE YOU

12:07.197 --> 12:09.099
TO SLAP YOUR OWN FACE,

12:09.099 --> 12:11.231
JUST LIKE SHE DID
LAST CHRISTMAS.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.234
(panting)

12:16.336 --> 12:19.739
YEAH, WHY WOULDN'T THAT
HAPPEN TO ME?

12:19.739 --> 12:20.740
HEY.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.212
(sighs)

12:22.212 --> 12:23.844
DID WILL ASK YOU
TO DO THAT TO HIS FLOOR?

12:23.844 --> 12:26.516
NO, I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME TOOLS
SO I COULD DISMEMBER MY CHAIR

12:26.516 --> 12:29.519
SO MY SISTER WON'T MAKE ME SLAP
MYSELFIN THE FACE AGAIN!
(slap)

12:29.519 --> 12:31.181
HAVE YOU SEEN GINA?

12:31.181 --> 12:34.354
NO! DO YOU KNOW HOW TO CLEAN
PAINT OFF OF A HARDWOOD FLOOR?!

12:34.354 --> 12:39.489
NO! SEE, YOU DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN I YELL AT YOU.

12:39.489 --> 12:41.761
(chuckles)
OH, GOOD THINKING.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.934
YOU GOT PAINT ON THE FLOOR.

12:43.934 --> 12:46.897
I KNEW I COULD COUNT
ON YOU.

12:46.897 --> 12:49.970
OH, MY GOD.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.903
(gasps) AND SOME GOT
ON THERESA'S EYE.

12:52.903 --> 12:54.374
SO I GOT A LITTLE PAINT
ON THE PAINTING.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.146
THAT'S LIKE SPILLING WATER
IN A SWIMMING POOL.

12:56.146 --> 12:58.508
YOU'VE GOT TO FIX THIS

12:58.508 --> 13:02.312
AND RESTORE THE CHAIR
AND CLEAN THE FLOOR

13:02.312 --> 13:04.314
AND FIND THE KLEPTOMANIAC!

13:04.314 --> 13:05.886
WE GOT YOUR BACK, WILL.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.258
AND STOP SAYING THAT!

13:13.523 --> 13:17.197
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE'S THERESA?

13:17.197 --> 13:20.130
UM, I DON'T... KNOW.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

13:20.130 --> 13:23.203
YOU CHECK THE REST OF THE HOUSE.
I'M GONNA WAIT HERE FOR HER.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.504
HELP ME FIND HER!

13:24.504 --> 13:26.476
YOU'RE LEAVING?

13:26.476 --> 13:28.038
WELL, I HAVE TO.

13:28.038 --> 13:31.081
YOU ARE REALLY DISAPPOINTING ME
A LOT THIS EVENING, CRAIG.

13:31.081 --> 13:34.985
HUH. THAT'S
AN OMINOUS THING TO SAY.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.519
(sighs)
(whimpers)

13:39.519 --> 13:43.593
THAT'S NOT ANY BETTER,
IS IT?
NOPE, IT'S WORSE.

13:43.593 --> 13:46.927
(video game gunfire
and explosions)
(lowered voice) SO GINA IS
GETTING A LITTLE WEIRD.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.259
REALLY? THE KLEPTOMANIAC
YOU MET ON THE INTERNET

13:49.259 --> 13:51.061
ISGETTINGWEIRD?

13:51.061 --> 13:53.003
HERE. YOU'RE AN ARTIST.

13:53.003 --> 13:54.304
GO GET NATHAN'S PAINTS
AND FIX THIS THING

13:54.304 --> 13:57.237
WHILE I GO LOOK FOR THERESA,
AND YOU--STRIP THAT CHAIR DOWN

13:57.237 --> 13:59.239
SO THAT BRENDA KEEPS
HER MOUTH SHUT.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.471
(sighs)

14:01.471 --> 14:02.973
WOW.
(door closes)

14:02.973 --> 14:04.474
WILL'S HOUSE IS KINDA HECTIC
AT NIGHT, ISN'T IT?

14:04.474 --> 14:06.446
YEAH, I COULDN'T LIVE HERE.

14:07.978 --> 14:11.121
TAKE THAT,
YOU LIGHT-LOVIN' BALL THIEF!

14:11.121 --> 14:12.452
(dog barking in distance)

14:12.452 --> 14:15.285
(lowered voice) NOW I'LL
NEVERGET MY RAKE BACK...

14:15.285 --> 14:16.426
OR MY LONGER RAKE.

14:16.426 --> 14:18.428
(lowered voice)
HEY, I NEED AN ALLEN WRENCH

14:18.428 --> 14:20.260
SO I CAN KEEP MURDERING
MY CHAIR.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.392
TAKE CARE OF THIS
WHILE I GET THERESA INSIDE.

14:22.392 --> 14:23.393
RICKSHAW!

14:23.393 --> 14:25.095
WHAT? (chuckles)

14:25.095 --> 14:27.367
OH, GOODY. ANOTHER TASK.

14:29.940 --> 14:33.273
OKAY, SO THERESA'S SLEEPING
AGAIN OR... STILL...

14:33.273 --> 14:35.345
(video game gunfire
and explosions)
OR WHATEVER THE HELL
SHE'S BEEN DOING.

14:35.345 --> 14:37.147
AND I FINISHED
THAT PAINTING. HANG ON.

14:37.147 --> 14:38.148
GREAT.

14:38.148 --> 14:39.409
AND I DEVELOPED
A PRETTY GOOD MOVE

14:39.409 --> 14:41.411
WHERE I SPIN IN A CIRCLE,
FIRING INDISCRIMINATELY.

14:41.411 --> 14:43.483
I CALL IT
THE "TORNADO OF DEATH,"

14:43.483 --> 14:46.456
SO IF YOU HEAR ME YELL,
"TORNADO OF DEATH,"

14:46.456 --> 14:48.358
FIND A DITCH AND PRAY.

14:48.358 --> 14:50.420
MAYBE THIS WILL WORK OUT.
BRENDA'S WITH THE KIDS.

14:50.420 --> 14:51.922
THE GAME STARTS
IN FIVE MINUTES.

14:51.922 --> 14:53.323
I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE
PULLED THIS OFF, BUDDY.

14:53.323 --> 14:56.566
COUPLE PROBLEMS. I'M HOPING
THEY'RE NOT RELATED.

14:56.566 --> 14:58.368
UM, THE PAINTING HAS
DISAPPEARED,

14:58.368 --> 15:00.030
AND GINA'S CAR IS GONE.

15:00.030 --> 15:02.402
ARE--ARE YOU KIDDING?
THAT'S IT. I'M DEAD.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.475
THERESA'S GONNA KILL ME.
(sighs)

15:08.278 --> 15:11.311
NO, WILL. THE FOUR OF US ARE
GONNA GO GET THAT PAINTING BACK.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.944
OH, BUT YOUR PRECIOUS VIDEO GAME
IS ABOUT TO START.

15:13.944 --> 15:17.347
THIS WHOLE EVENING IS
MY... FRIEND KENNY'S FAULT.

15:17.347 --> 15:19.089
SHOULD WE FORGIVE HIM?
DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN.

15:19.089 --> 15:20.920
SHOULD HE BE PUNISHED?
UNMERCIFULLY.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.123
I THINK WHAT CRAIG IS
TRYING TO SAY IS,

15:23.123 --> 15:24.424
HE BROUGHT THE KLEPTO OVER,

15:24.424 --> 15:26.356
AND SO THE WHOLE THING IS
HIS FAULT,

15:26.356 --> 15:29.059
AND EVEN THOUGH THAT IS,
WITHOUT DOUBT OR CONTROVERSY,

15:29.059 --> 15:31.001
THE ONLY EXPLANATION
FOR TONIGHT,

15:31.001 --> 15:33.363
I'M GONNA HELP YOU, TOO.
I AGREE.

15:33.363 --> 15:34.934
KENNY'S ENTIRELY TO BLAME,
AND THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.106
NO RESTARTS, INFINITY.

15:36.106 --> 15:37.537
GAH!

15:37.537 --> 15:39.569
EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NO
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY OF THIS

15:39.569 --> 15:43.443
BECAUSE I AM IN NO WAY AT FAULT,
I WANT TO HELP, TOO.

15:43.443 --> 15:49.519
AGAIN, SUMMING UP,
GRANT--HELPFUL BUT BLAMELESS.

15:49.519 --> 15:53.083
NOW LET'S DO THIS.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.485
GINA, HONEY?

15:55.485 --> 15:57.357
I THINK THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
A MISUNDERSTANDING

15:57.357 --> 16:00.490
ABOUT WHOSE PAINTING
OF WILL'S FAMILY THAT IS.

16:00.490 --> 16:03.233
(Gina) YOU HURT MY FEELINGS,
CRAIG. GO AWAY.

16:03.233 --> 16:05.335
BABY--
OKAY. NO MORE CODDLING.

16:06.336 --> 16:07.967
LISTEN UP, YOU PSYCHO.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.239
(spritzes)

16:09.239 --> 16:13.403
(high-pitched voice)
OH, MY GOD! MY EYES! OHH!

16:13.403 --> 16:15.245
MY BEAUTIFUL EYES!

16:15.245 --> 16:16.676
KENNY.
AAH!

16:16.676 --> 16:18.378
THEY'RE RUINED!

16:18.378 --> 16:21.081
(lowered voice)
GUYS! GUYS, COME ON.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.282
THERE'S AN OPEN WINDOW.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.414
(sighs, lowered voice)
BUT WHAT--

16:24.414 --> 16:26.116
I'M GOING IN!
SHH, KENNY!

16:26.116 --> 16:27.117
NO!
OH, GOD!

16:27.117 --> 16:28.118
SHH, KENNY!
BEES!

16:28.118 --> 16:29.359
ROSE-SCENTED BEES!

16:29.359 --> 16:31.261
KENNY, NO, SHH!
IT'S ROSEBUSHES!

16:31.261 --> 16:32.692
LOOK, WE NEED A LADDER

16:32.692 --> 16:36.496
OR--OR SUITS OF LEATHER
OR A-A JAPANESE GARDEN BRIDGE.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.468
OOH, THAT WOULD BE LOVELY.

16:38.468 --> 16:40.500
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.
I'M GONNA LIE DOWN.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.473
YOU GUYS GRAB MY ARMS AND LEGS,
SWING ME BACK AND FORTH,

16:43.473 --> 16:45.405
BUILD UP SOME MOMENTUM, AND THEN
TOSS ME AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.407
I'LL TWIST IN THE AIR,
GRAB THE WINDOW,

16:47.407 --> 16:50.680
AND PULL MYSELF IN.
ANY QUESTIONS?

16:53.213 --> 16:56.386
NOBODY? REALLY?

16:56.386 --> 16:58.788
OKAY, I'LL GO.
ARE YOU INSANE?!

16:58.788 --> 17:00.490
WILL, I CAN DO THIS.
I DID GYMNASTICS

17:00.490 --> 17:02.722
IN HIGH SCHOOL
FOR, LIKE, SIX WEEKS.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.494
WATCH.

17:05.425 --> 17:09.099
(exhales deeply)

17:13.103 --> 17:15.635
(gruntting and exhaling deeply)

17:18.768 --> 17:20.140
YAH!

17:20.140 --> 17:23.213
(panting)

17:23.213 --> 17:26.546
(grunts)

17:34.554 --> 17:36.356
GOD, YOU SOUND SO NIMBLE.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.528
THE TRICK IS TO LET GO
OF MY ARMS A SPLIT SECOND

17:38.528 --> 17:40.560
BEFORE YOU LET GO OF MY LEGS,
SO I TWIST IN THE AIR

17:40.560 --> 17:42.432
AND I CAN GRAB
THE WINDOW FRAME WITH MY HANDS.

17:42.432 --> 17:44.494
REMEMBER,
ARMS ANDTHENLEGS.

17:44.494 --> 17:46.266
IT'S CRITICAL THAT YOU DO IT
IN THAT ORDER.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.268
OTHERWISE,
THIS MIGHT NOT WORK.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.500
COME ON. I'LL CALL IT OUT.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.142
ALL RIGHT. HERE.

17:53.243 --> 17:55.175
HERE, HERE, HERE.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.476
OKAY. HEY.

17:56.476 --> 17:59.179
(exhales deeply)
AND... SWING.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.810
(grunts)
AND KEEP SWINGING.

18:00.810 --> 18:02.452
REMEMBER,
IT'S ARMS AND THEN LEGS.

18:02.452 --> 18:04.414
HERE WE GO. ONE...
(grunts)

18:04.414 --> 18:05.655
TWO... HERE IT GOES.
(grunts)

18:05.655 --> 18:08.518
ARMS, LEGS. ARMS, LEGS!
(thud)

18:08.518 --> 18:10.490
NO! OW, OW! AAH!

18:10.490 --> 18:12.462
DID HE MAKE IT? IS HE IN?

18:13.593 --> 18:15.625
WRONG! THAT WAS WRONG!
(whispers) CRAIG?

18:15.625 --> 18:17.197
GENTLEMEN.
(police radio chatter)

18:17.197 --> 18:19.629
WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE TONIGHT?

18:19.629 --> 18:20.800
HOW YOU DOING, SPIDER-MAN?

18:20.800 --> 18:23.373
TRUTHFULLY,
I'M IN A LOT OF PAIN.

18:23.373 --> 18:25.205
OW. OW.

18:29.279 --> 18:31.211
IT WAS NICE OF GINA
TO GIVE US THE PAINTING BACK.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.683
THE POLICE MADE HER GIVE IT BACK
BECAUSE SHE STOLE IT

18:33.683 --> 18:35.645
BECAUSE THERE'S A MONKEY
IN A WEDDING DRESS

18:35.645 --> 18:37.687
JUMPING ON A TRAMPOLINE
WHERE HER BRAIN SHOULD BE.

18:37.687 --> 18:39.519
SHE HAS A DISEASE, KENNY.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.751
WOULD YOU TALK THAT WAY ABOUT
SOMEBODY WHO HAD FRECKLES

18:41.751 --> 18:44.624
OR AN ITCHY TRIGGER FINGER
OR A CASE OF THE MUNCHIES?
UH...

18:44.624 --> 18:46.426
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT DISEASES
ARE, DO YOU, CRAIG?

18:46.426 --> 18:50.129
GUYS, PLEASE. I JUST HAD
THE WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.861
ALL I WANT IS
ONE MOMENT OF QUIET

18:51.861 --> 18:53.263
BEFORE I WALK INTO MY HOUSE

18:53.263 --> 18:55.205
AND HAVE THE WORST MORNING
OF MY LIFE.

18:55.205 --> 18:58.408
KEEN! GET OVER HERE!

18:58.408 --> 19:00.540
YOU SAID FIX IT.
IT WOULDN'T WASH OFF.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.611
(sighs)

19:01.611 --> 19:03.913
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS, KEEN, HUH?

19:03.913 --> 19:06.576
YOU KNOW WHAT, GLENN?

19:06.576 --> 19:08.648
I DO KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS,

19:08.648 --> 19:10.850
AND IF YOU HAD ADJUSTED
YOUR STUPID MOTION LIGHT,

19:10.850 --> 19:13.553
I NEVER WOULD HAVE TREATED
MY WIFE LIKE A HORSE

19:13.553 --> 19:14.754
AND NONE OF THIS WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED,

19:14.754 --> 19:16.526
AND, YES, THAT DOES MAKE SENSE,

19:16.526 --> 19:19.729
SO MOVE THE LIGHT
AND THROW MY KIDS' BALLS BACK,

19:19.729 --> 19:22.792
OR YOU ARE GONNA FIND
ALL KINDS OF CRAZY-ASS THINGS

19:22.792 --> 19:25.335
PAINTED ALL OVER YOUR HOUSE.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

19:25.335 --> 19:27.797
UH, YEAH. SURE.

19:27.797 --> 19:31.641
GOOD, AND NO MORE MOWING
YOUR LAWN IN YOUR KHAKI PANTS.

19:31.641 --> 19:34.574
I DON'T LIKE IT. IT'S WEIRD.

19:38.508 --> 19:42.712
LISTEN, LAST NIGHT
WHEN GINA TOOK THE PAINTING,

19:42.712 --> 19:46.356
YOU GUYS REALLY DID HAVE
MY BACK, SO THANK YOU.

19:46.356 --> 19:47.617
SURE.
YOU GOT IT.

19:47.617 --> 19:50.189
IT WAS WORTH IT.
PLUS I LEARNED WHEN YOU RUN

19:50.189 --> 19:51.721
INTO POLICE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT, IT GOES

19:51.721 --> 19:54.694
A WHOLE LOT SMOOTHER IF YOU'RE
WITH A BUNCH OF WHITE DUDES.

19:55.925 --> 19:57.927
(inhales deeply)

19:57.927 --> 19:59.769
(keys jangle)
WELL, HERE GOES.

19:59.769 --> 20:00.870
(lock clicks)

20:04.634 --> 20:06.776
(under breath) PUT THE PAINTING
IN THE HALLWAY.
(door closes)

20:09.939 --> 20:14.914
THERE THEY ARE.
BRENDA TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

20:14.914 --> 20:18.288
THANK YOU FOR TAKING CARE OF
THE KIDS AND LETTING ME SLEEP.

20:18.288 --> 20:21.851
GOD, THAT PILL REALLY WORKED!
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

20:21.851 --> 20:23.493
"WONUNOL..."
(chuckles)

20:23.493 --> 20:25.895
"SAY... (imitates horse's neigh)
TO INSOMNIA."

20:25.895 --> 20:26.956
(buzzer sounds)

20:26.956 --> 20:29.499
OH. I GOTTA POP
THE SHEETS IN THE DRYER.

20:29.499 --> 20:30.860
MWAH.

20:30.860 --> 20:32.332
(mouths words)

20:32.332 --> 20:33.703
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?

20:33.703 --> 20:36.306
I LOVE THERESA, AND I FIGURED
IT WOULD BREAK HER HEART

20:36.306 --> 20:38.808
IF SHE FOUND OUT
WHAT AN IDIOT SHE MARRIED.

20:38.808 --> 20:41.971
IT WOULD.
IT REALLY, REALLY WOULD...

20:41.971 --> 20:43.673
(lowered voice) BUT WHERE
DOES SHE THINK WE WERE?

20:43.673 --> 20:46.346
I TOLD HER YOU ALL GOT UP EARLY
TO CLEAN OUT MY GARAGE,

20:46.346 --> 20:48.478
WHICH YOU WILL BE
DOING TODAY.

20:48.478 --> 20:49.479
(men) OHH.

20:49.479 --> 20:51.681
ALSO, I HID
ALL YOUR ADOLESCENT CRAP

20:51.681 --> 20:52.922
AROUND THE SIDE
OF THE HOUSE,

20:52.922 --> 20:54.854
INCLUDING THE EGG CHAIR
THAT YOU CAN KEEP, KENNY.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.986
IT WAS ENOUGH JUST
TO WATCH YOU DESTROY...

20:56.986 --> 20:58.928
(whispers)
YOUR PRECIOUS NERD CAPSULE.

20:58.928 --> 21:01.531
I SHALL REBUILD IT, AND IT SHALL
BE STRONGER, FASTER,

21:01.531 --> 21:04.294
WITH A SUNROOF
AND A THING TO PEE IN.

21:04.294 --> 21:06.966
(Theresa) WILL, COULD YOU
COME HERE FOR A SECOND?

21:09.499 --> 21:11.841
(sighs)

21:11.841 --> 21:15.004
LOOK AT MY EYE.
WHAT HAPPENED?

21:15.004 --> 21:18.878
UH, I HAVE NO IDEA...

21:20.450 --> 21:23.883
BUT I THINK YOUR BODY TYPE
CAN HANDLE IT.
