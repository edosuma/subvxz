[Bev] He fell asleep
while I was sucking him off.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.120
At first I thought he was dying,
but now I get it.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.600
We've dwindled.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.480
And by "dwindled,"
I mean Tom's dick is under lock and key.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.720
You think he's cheating?

00:23.800 --> 00:26.200
If Tom were fucking someone else,
he'd be a lot more upbeat.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.480
I promise.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.240
-It just sounds like he's really unhappy.
-I hope so.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.880
Oh, yeah. They're over the moon
when they're banging someone new.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.720
This has probably reached its natural end.

00:34.800 --> 00:35.640
Stop that!

00:35.720 --> 00:37.200
Well, ten years is a success.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.120

I booked in for some lipo.

-Don't.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.520
Shep as the father
just makes the most practical sense.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.080
And you think Evan
will happily agree to this, will he?

01:17.480 --> 01:21.360
You think it's practical to try for a baby
with your greatest enemy?

01:21.440 --> 01:24.520
Yes. You don't hate them before the baby's
born. You hate them after anyway.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.000
It's a business transaction.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.800
Poor, hot Evan.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.280
Evan will be fine.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.800
He would've lost interest
at some point anyway. They all do.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.320
We might as well enjoy men
as temporary figures

01:35.400 --> 01:37.920
and focus on what is best
for our children.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.160
[woman] I thought that what was best
for my child

01:40.240 --> 01:42.920
was a stint at an arts college
in Switzerland.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.880
But he ran off with a German tranny
from the music program.

01:47.280 --> 01:50.000
And now he spins records on poppers.

01:50.080 --> 01:53.600
Well, we are very sorry to hear
that your son is a DJ, Maureen,

01:53.680 --> 01:55.200

You're very manipulative and it's

03:27.400 --> 03:29.080
This whole "let's have another baby" thing

isn't because Olive needs a sibling and I
desperately want my perineum re-torn.

he is to be called Ethos.

04:00.600 --> 04:03.400
You're not naming the baby. Not after
your suggestions for Olive's name.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.560
You wouldn't understand,
'cause you're not an artist.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.320
I am literally an artist,
and I'm not paying a stud fee

04:08.400 --> 04:10.600

on ammunition and strippers.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.480

04:24.560 --> 04:27.840
It's for the grief counseling I'll need
after seeing your tired old gash again.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.960
I'm a pop star.
I'm used to much higher quality.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.760
Yeah? Well, while you've been
living down here like Julian Assange,

04:32.840 --> 04:35.280
there have been advances in medicine,
so I can pay a doctor

04:35.360 --> 04:36.840
and he can make a baby in a dish.

10:27.240 --> 10:30.200
She's just got
a lot of challenging history, you know?

10:30.280 --> 10:32.480
Her kid's dad is complicated.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.520
Really put her through some hell
at one point. Trust issues, but...

10:37.120 --> 10:38.520
I'll show her she can count on me.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.280
I'll make a fun dad, hey, Tyler?

10:41.480 --> 10:43.960
About a year ago,
Leo told me I should walk away.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.120
What was it you said?

10:45.200 --> 10:48.320
That being with this woman
was like sitting at a slot machine,

10:48.400 --> 10:50.640
putting coins in, waiting for a windfall.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.960
A real man sticks around, Tyler.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.960
[Leo] And you know the casino always wins,

10:55.040 --> 10:57.640
but you can't leave,
because, every once in a while,

10:57.720 --> 10:59.720
the game chucks you back a few coins.

10:59.800 --> 11:00.760
All right, Leo. It's--

11:00.840 --> 11:05.120
You think, "If I give up now, the next guy
who sits down is gonna hit the jackpot

11:05.200 --> 11:07.400
and I will have wasted all this money."

11:09.320 --> 11:13.600
The lesson, Tyler, is this.
A single mother is never damaged goods.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.000
[Tyler spits]

11:15.760 --> 11:16.920
I'm gay.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.400
Oh, cool.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.280
Ah... Awesome.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.400
Hey, thanks for sharing. That's great.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.440
-Fist bump? Well done, man.
-No.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.000
All right. Yeah, you... Totally... Mm-hmm.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.680
[Olive] What time did you get home
last night?

11:33.760 --> 11:34.840
Not too late.

11:34.920 --> 11:38.400
I went and ran some errands with Dr. Evan
and then we had a drink. Maybe 11.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.800
Eleven o'clock?

11:39.880 --> 11:43.400
Who stays out until eleven o'clock
when they've got patients in the morning?

11:43.480 --> 11:45.360
And you trust this man with my teeth?

11:45.440 --> 11:47.400
What has been your problem all morning?

11:47.480 --> 11:49.280
I'm not the one who's got a problem.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.600
-Millie said--
-[girl] Olive!

11:50.680 --> 11:51.560
Never mind.

11:52.840 --> 11:53.680
[sighs]

11:54.640 --> 11:57.520
-Hey, Jane.
-Doing the school run with a mug of tea?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.280
[laughs] Look, Brian,
she's got a mug of tea.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.640
A mug from home.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.320
It's pretty wild, yeah.

12:03.400 --> 12:07.080
I was over there, at home, drinking tea
and now I'm still drinking it.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.400
Oh, you're such a free spirit. [laughs]

12:09.480 --> 12:13.240
Look at us, having a laugh.
This is what forgiveness is all about.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.240
Hmm. Yeah.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.280
Katherine, um,
as a sort of a bonding exercise,

12:17.360 --> 12:19.400
I'm... I'm gonna confide in you now.

12:20.520 --> 12:21.960
Ever since I got sober,

12:22.440 --> 12:24.720
I make a personal inventory
every time I've been wrong

12:24.800 --> 12:27.400
and I promptly make amends for it.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.320
Oh.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.160
Well, I accept your apology.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.320
Oh, um...

12:32.000 --> 12:33.240
Yeah, the photo... I mean...

12:34.480 --> 12:36.920
-Let's just draw a line under it. [laughs]
-Okay.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Millie just can't stop talking about
what a wonderful time she had with Olive.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.160
-Oh, great.
-A mug of tea from home?

12:42.240 --> 12:46.640
[sarcastically] Yeah. It's an inside mug,
but you're seeing it outside. I know.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.560
[Jane laughs]

12:47.640 --> 12:49.560
Okay. Well, I really gotta go.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.680
Let's get the girls together again soon
then.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.880
[woman] Tea from home!

13:03.440 --> 13:05.560
Have you ever had sex with my dad?

13:06.240 --> 13:07.080
With what?

13:09.400 --> 13:12.480
You lied. Millie told me
where babies come from, and you lied.

13:12.560 --> 13:16.120
No. Babies can come from the fertility
clinic. That's a way to make babies.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.000
But the doctor doesn't use blood.
He'd be using semen.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.480
Se... Semen can have blood in it,

13:21.560 --> 13:24.040
like if a man gets kicked in the nuts
or has an infection.

13:24.120 --> 13:27.200
And did you and Dad go
to the fertility clinic to have me or...

13:28.520 --> 13:31.480
We... went to a concert...

13:32.080 --> 13:33.520
and you don't need to know the rest.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.760
You had sex with my dad at a concert?

13:36.840 --> 13:38.920
That's so gross, Mum! That's so gross.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.880
It's so gross! I was really drunk.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.880
Why would Millie tell you that?

13:42.960 --> 13:44.880
It's not Millie's fault
that you're disgusting!

13:44.960 --> 13:48.040
<i>This </i>is why I didn't tell you about sex.
I knew I'd lose your respect.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.960
Mum, no, you're lying.
Say that you're lying!

13:51.040 --> 13:53.800
I've done a lot of things
I'm really ashamed of, but I'm better now.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.960
-You embarrassed me in front of her.
-Well, she--

13:56.040 --> 13:58.560
-I lied to you to protect you.
-[Olive] Millie had to tell me.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.880
-Millie did not have to--
-I can't trust you anymore.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.600
I knew I shouldn't let Millie
in the house.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.480
You know what? You're a tart!

14:04.560 --> 14:06.200
-No! Wha--
-Hey, whoa, what's going on?

14:06.280 --> 14:08.880
-What are you doing here?
-You didn't tell her I was sleeping over?

14:08.960 --> 14:10.920
-[Katherine sighs]
-So you can have sex again?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.280
-Uhh...
-Olive!

14:12.640 --> 14:14.880
Dr. Evan's just gonna start
spending the night as a test.

14:14.960 --> 14:15.840
It's not a big deal.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.520
I live here, too.
I should've been consulted.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.000
This is so you can have sex.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.640
You can't talk to your mother like that.

14:21.720 --> 14:22.840
You're not my dad.

14:22.920 --> 14:23.840
That was fast.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.480
And you're not my mother.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.720
I don't know when you started thinking
you were the boss,

14:27.800 --> 14:29.040
but you need to go to your room.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.000
You're going to have a new family
with a dentist and forget about me.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.120
Olive.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.680
I'm going to <i>our </i>room
and <i>you </i>will be sleeping there with me.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.120
[sighs] She's not normally like this.
She made a new friend.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.760
[Olive] And you can tell that clown
that I am not brushing my teeth tonight.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.800
-[door slams]
-She doesn't mean that. [chuckles]

14:50.960 --> 14:51.840
[she sighs]

14:52.920 --> 14:54.040
Hey, I, um...

14:55.640 --> 14:57.320
I brought over a few things to show you.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.240
You brought me a baby picture of yourself
to show me?

15:04.320 --> 15:06.080
I noticed you keep a lot of them around.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.400
Of Olive.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.040
[chuckles] It's pretty cute.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.000
Yeah, I'm amazed
they even got one of me awake.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.120
You know, I was always just sleeping
and laughing,

15:15.200 --> 15:18.360
not being sick at all.
That's my first day at school.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.720
-[Katherine] Hmm.
-Oh, what's this? Oh! [chuckles]

15:20.800 --> 15:23.000
Is that my report card?
[scoffs] What's it doing in there?

15:23.600 --> 15:24.560
[he clears his throat]

15:25.040 --> 15:26.440
"Evan makes friends easily

15:26.520 --> 15:28.960
and is a natural leader in the classroom."
Huh.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.240
Wow.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.960
You know, my mum was the only one in her
friendship circle that didn't need Valium.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.400
I should go check on Olive.
I don't want her going to sleep angry.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.560
-Sure you don't mind sleeping in her room?
-Of course.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.400
I just want you two girls
to be comfortable.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.120
[sighs]

15:49.880 --> 15:50.800
[dog whimpers]

15:57.200 --> 15:58.520
Me holding my friend's kid.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.200
-[dog whines and pants]
-[quietly] I'll just leave it there.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.240
[dog whimpers]

16:07.440 --> 16:08.280
[Evan groans]

16:10.160 --> 16:11.320
[sighs]

16:12.280 --> 16:13.600
-[breathes deeply]
-[door opens]

16:19.160 --> 16:20.600
You cleaned the kitchen.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.320
[Evan sighs] It's true.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.680
I had a wild first night. [chuckles]

16:27.760 --> 16:29.880
-How's Olive?
-Unrepentant and asleep.

16:34.640 --> 16:39.600
[raunchy music plays]

16:45.960 --> 16:46.800
[Evan groans]

16:47.600 --> 16:48.720
-Mmm, I can't.
-[music stops]

16:48.800 --> 16:49.720
Um...

16:49.800 --> 16:50.960
I... I'm on my period.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.720
I thought you said before
real gangsters run red lights?

16:54.640 --> 16:55.600
I was kidding.

16:55.680 --> 16:56.920
Oh, seriously, I don't mind.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.440
Especially since you've had it
for, like, three weeks?

16:59.960 --> 17:02.480
Well, I just came in here
to make out a bit and....

17:03.280 --> 17:04.120
suck you off?

17:05.280 --> 17:06.120
Okay.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.800
[music resumes]

17:22.880 --> 17:25.480
[breathes deeply]

17:25.560 --> 17:26.520
-[music stops]
-[groans]

17:27.000 --> 17:29.400
Whatever, let's just have sex.
My jaw really hurts.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.080
Okay.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.800
[music resumes]

17:52.800 --> 17:54.640
-[music stops]
-Actually, no, wait, stop. Um...

17:54.720 --> 17:57.560
I'm just really distracted.
I'm worried about Bev's surgery tomorrow.

17:57.640 --> 18:00.480
-[groans] Can we just--
-Maybe you could just finish on me?

18:00.560 --> 18:01.760
[he sighs]

18:01.840 --> 18:04.360
-Um...
-Please. I'm really tired.

18:05.840 --> 18:06.920
[sighs] Okay.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.440
[sighs]

18:12.720 --> 18:14.480
[she inhales, then sighs]

18:14.560 --> 18:16.800
So, like,
tomorrow's just this routine procedure

18:16.880 --> 18:20.000
where they inject tumescent fluid
into the fat cells to break them apart,

18:20.080 --> 18:21.960
then they suck them out
and then put them back,

18:22.040 --> 18:23.480
-just wherever you need volume.
-Yeah.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.480
Last time Bev did it,
they got a liter and a half.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.320
That's crazy. She's thin already.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.440
-Hey, can we just--
-Bev's thin because she gets lipo.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.280
Oh, we can't tell Tom, but she never said
I had to keep it from you.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.000
Maybe you could pick us up?
Then we wouldn't have to take a cab back.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.040
Yeah, I, um...

18:37.400 --> 18:38.960
I've gotta fit a crown after lunch,

18:39.040 --> 18:41.280
but, uh, it's pretty important
in terms of... [sighs]

18:41.360 --> 18:43.240
...uh, restoring the... [sighs]

18:43.320 --> 18:44.160
...function.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.600
I'd feel bad if I moved it, so...

18:46.520 --> 18:47.680
I could come after.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.120
Or you could come now.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.160
[laughs nervously]

18:50.240 --> 18:51.120
Here.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.200
Oh, my God, you cleaned up in here, too?

19:03.280 --> 19:04.360
[Katherine] Wow.

19:04.440 --> 19:08.240
You are, like, so good looking
and funny and nice.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.600
You're a real catch.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.080
-Maybe we should have sex.
-[he gasps]

19:13.960 --> 19:14.800
[he sighs]

19:19.440 --> 19:20.640
[both sigh]

19:21.120 --> 19:22.160
Good night.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.520
-What?
-I'm going to my room.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.480
<i>♪ That, that, that, that, that's my...</i>
<i>That's my wave ♪</i>

19:31.560 --> 19:33.800

19:33.880 --> 19:36.040
<i>♪ Don't be scared, I ain't afraid ♪</i>

19:36.120 --> 19:37.080
<i>♪ Just like that... ♪</i>

19:37.160 --> 19:40.440
No, darling, you shouldn't have put
all your trucks in the toilet.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.160
[door opens]

19:42.760 --> 19:45.480
Put Daddy on again, please,
and I'll speak to you after dinner.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.480
What's going on?

19:49.560 --> 19:51.240
-Well, talk to him, Tom.
-[cork pops]

19:51.320 --> 19:54.200
Find out who's teaching him
words like "dirty protest."

19:54.920 --> 19:56.200
All right, I'll see you tonight.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.160
[coughs]

19:58.240 --> 19:59.200
Love you.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.000
Hey. How are you feeling?

20:02.080 --> 20:04.040
A bit of pain in my chest. [coughs]

20:04.120 --> 20:06.480
It's from the breathing tube.
It's always the worst of it.

20:06.560 --> 20:09.440
Oh, my God, get this. Jane is in AA.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.360
[Bev splutters]

20:11.000 --> 20:13.360
-There goes the second A.
-[Katherine] I saw her with Brian

20:13.440 --> 20:15.480
and the rat child,
and she apologized to me.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.040
How funny would it be
if she started drinking again?

20:18.120 --> 20:20.640
[chokes and splutters]

20:20.720 --> 20:22.840
[Bev] Oh, shit. [coughs]

20:22.920 --> 20:25.080
[gasps and coughs]

20:26.320 --> 20:28.640
[voice cracks] Shit.
I feel like I'm gonna die.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.200
That's not funny, you cunt.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.760
[chokes]

20:31.840 --> 20:33.360
-[machines beep]
-Bollocks. [gasps]

20:33.760 --> 20:34.920
[Bev] I can't breathe.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.920
My boys. [choking]

20:37.000 --> 20:38.400
Calling "Where's Mum?"

20:38.960 --> 20:40.000
[Bev chokes]

20:40.080 --> 20:42.040
[nurse 1] Are you okay? Okay, all right.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.640
-[nurse 2] Can we have some help in here?
-[nurse 1] Breathe.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.360
-I need you to wait outside, please.
-No. Bev?

20:47.440 --> 20:48.600
-Breathe!
-[machines beep]

20:48.680 --> 20:50.720
-I need you to wait outside.
-I didn't mean it.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.240
-[Bev chokes]
-Bev?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.400
-[machines beep]
-Hey, what's going on?

20:55.480 --> 20:57.000
[Bev chokes]

20:57.080 --> 20:58.200
I called her a cunt.

21:04.680 --> 21:10.320
[mournful music plays]

21:19.520 --> 21:22.080
What's an embolism?

21:22.840 --> 21:24.800
Well, when you're having
a routine fat transfer,

21:24.880 --> 21:28.480
sometimes they put it back too deep and
it forms a clot that travels to the lungs.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.480
That's why, when you're older,
it's so important

21:31.560 --> 21:33.920
that you only choose
the best plastic surgeon.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.720
Why didn't Auntie Bev
have the best doctor?

21:37.240 --> 21:39.600
She did,
but he was abusing amphetamines.

21:39.680 --> 21:40.520
Oh.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.760
How many days are you going to be
dressing like a witch for?

21:43.840 --> 21:45.640
For as long as I'm in mourning.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.160
But, Mummy...

21:47.240 --> 21:48.440
Bev's still alive.

21:48.520 --> 21:49.960
Yeah, Bev pulled through, luckily,

21:50.040 --> 21:53.280
but my mind went straight to the grief
and then immediately to the outfit.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.080
Who would look after me if you died?

21:58.800 --> 22:01.440
Well, I guess your dad
would have to give it his best shot.

22:01.840 --> 22:04.720
And... And would Daddy
look after our baby, too?

22:05.160 --> 22:07.320
No, not unless he was the baby's dad.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.160
I think you'd better try extra hard
to stay alive.

22:18.240 --> 22:20.120
Maybe leave all your fat where it is.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.720
Aww, that's not realistic, is it, honey?

22:22.800 --> 22:23.760
[Shep] Ooh la la!

22:23.840 --> 22:26.400
<i>Bonjour, </i>Celine Dion. Who died?

22:26.480 --> 22:27.680
-Daddy!
-[he laughs]

22:28.480 --> 22:30.280
Aunt Bev <i>almost </i>died, Daddy.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.640
Thanks for saying I'm like Celine Dion.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.840
What are amphetamines, Dad?

22:34.920 --> 22:37.160
[whispers] They're incredible.
What happened to Bev?

22:37.240 --> 22:38.680
She had an operation.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.280
So Mum got her black clothes
out of the cellar, because she's sad.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.720
-[bell rings]
-I've got to go.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.840
[sighs sadly]

22:47.920 --> 22:49.120
[mouths] Thank you.

22:51.720 --> 22:53.960
-Bev didn't die.
-She died for a minute.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.760
-Imagine needing attention that bad.
-Hey,

22:55.840 --> 22:57.520
I am fucking sad.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.120
-If I die--
-Nobody died.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.760
<i>If </i>I died...

23:01.280 --> 23:03.240
before you, I mean,
which would be so unfair,

23:03.320 --> 23:05.800
considering you're a junkie
who's had syphilis at least twice--

23:05.880 --> 23:07.320
<i>Beat </i>syphilis twice. Go on.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.800
I would want my children to stay together.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.280
You think I'm gonna keep my favorite
and sell the other one?

23:12.360 --> 23:14.360
Ideally, you'll be dismembered
in a boating accident

23:14.440 --> 23:16.760
and the children and I will be free
to get on with our lives.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.960
[sighs] In any case, you've got a deal.

23:20.880 --> 23:25.440
To secure my children's future together,
I will agree to the terms of the...

23:25.520 --> 23:27.160
[mockingly] ...legacy agreement.

23:29.080 --> 23:29.920
[sniffs]

23:30.400 --> 23:31.240
The name?

23:31.920 --> 23:32.960
The ten grand?

23:33.600 --> 23:34.440
The...

23:35.920 --> 23:36.880
natural conception?

23:36.960 --> 23:40.200
-[sighs] Assuming your dick still works.
-Oh, my dick works.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.800
That's one of you with a job then.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.880
Fuck you, motherfucker.
I wish I trusted doctors.

23:43.960 --> 23:45.960
This is gonna be
the greatest sacrifice of my life.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.360
You think?
Welcome to parenthood, shit-hawk!
