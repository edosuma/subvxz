25:38.997 --> 25:40.707
If I used one
to bring Cyrus back,

what they wish for.

27:11.423 --> 27:13.300
I'll be the one asking questions.

27:13.884 --> 27:15.969
Right. So this makes us
all square then?

27:16.053 --> 27:17.638
You said if I got her here, I'd get...

27:17.721 --> 27:19.765
I said we'd settle up
when the game was complete.

27:19.848 --> 27:21.808
We are still setting up the board.

27:22.601 --> 27:24.436
Now as for your friend Alice,

27:24.520 --> 27:27.231
I need you to report
everything she does,

27:27.314 --> 27:30.901
where she goes, who she talks to,
what she is thinking.

27:31.735 --> 27:33.195
I need more than my eyes.

27:33.278 --> 27:34.655
I need your ears,

27:35.197 --> 27:37.157
and you will either help me, darling...

27:38.617 --> 27:40.327
Or decorate this room.

27:41.161 --> 27:42.162
Understood?

27:43.539 --> 27:45.791
Yes, Your Majesty.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.292
Now leave.

The Hatter's place is on the other side.

28:03.976 --> 28:05.769
Aren't you worried this is all a trap?

28:05.853 --> 28:07.980
If there's a chance that Cyrus is alive,

28:08.814 --> 28:09.815
we have to take it.

28:16.822 --> 28:17.948
Right. Let's go.

28:19.825 --> 28:20.826
KNAVE: The Red Queen.

28:20.909 --> 28:24.204
You said it was also her
who threw Cyrus into the Boiling Sea.

28:24.288 --> 28:25.455
Why would she do that?

28:25.539 --> 28:28.542
ALICE: I don't know,
but I'd love to ask her

28:28.625 --> 28:30.544
and see the look on her face
when she realizes

28:30.627 --> 28:32.212
I'm not the forgiving sort,

28:32.296 --> 28:35.841
particularly when said face
meets this branch, repeatedly.

28:36.383 --> 28:37.634
Doesn't sound like you.

28:37.718 --> 28:40.512
The Doctor said I'm a danger
to myself and to others.

28:41.221 --> 28:43.390
Yeah, you can't believe
everything you read now.

28:43.473 --> 28:44.474
ALICE: I don't.

28:45.475 --> 28:48.937
In fact, when I thought Cyrus was dead,

28:50.898 --> 28:52.858
I stopped believing in much of anything.

29:13.337 --> 29:14.338
She's back.

29:14.588 --> 29:16.632
And what is the girl doing now?

29:18.258 --> 29:20.219
Looking for her genie, of course.

29:21.094 --> 29:23.347
Isn't that what we wanted, Jafar?

29:33.982 --> 29:37.611
What we want can't be accomplished
until we have the genie's bottle

29:37.694 --> 29:39.696
and the girl's made all her wishes.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.615
So I'd say

29:41.698 --> 29:44.368
perhaps you shouldn't be
so pleased with yourself.

29:44.451 --> 29:47.204
Do not talk down to me, Jafar.
