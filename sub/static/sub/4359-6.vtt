You guys want to go grab a soda?

01:01.840 --> 01:04.200
I don't know,
I've got homework.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.440
Yeah, me too.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.680
I have homework
from last year

01:07.680 --> 01:09.600
I haven't gotten to yet.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.680
So what are you guys
saying?

01:11.680 --> 01:12.640
Are you in?

01:12.640 --> 01:13.640
Yeah, I'm in.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.800
It's Friday,
we've got all weekend.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.360
Let's rock.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.400
Want to come
to the half-life?

01:19.400 --> 01:20.600
Are you
serious?

01:20.600 --> 01:22.120
I have a math exam Monday

01:22.120 --> 01:23.320
worth half my grade.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.560
Come on, you could
stop studying now

01:25.560 --> 01:26.680
and ace it.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.520
For your information,
Louis

01:28.520 --> 01:30.320
good grades
aren't just luck.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.840
You have to work hard.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.600
Don't get so upset.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.040
What would I know
about good grades?

01:36.040 --> 01:37.880
<i>( Laughing )</i>

01:37.880 --> 01:39.600
Sure you don't want
to take

01:39.600 --> 01:41.120
a study break, Nicole?

01:41.120 --> 01:42.440
See, I heard that if

01:42.440 --> 01:44.800
you study too much
you can get ulcers

01:44.800 --> 01:46.760
and stress-related
illnesses.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.760
I'll see you guys later, okay?

01:51.360 --> 01:53.560
<i>Wow, she is
wound up tight.</i>

02:08.280 --> 02:10.280
I've never seen Nicole
like that.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.800
Her family
is all achievers.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.960
Making the honor roll
is expected.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.320
If she doesn't get an "A"
in math, she won't make it.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.120
I know about
not living up to

02:19.120 --> 02:20.800
family academic
traditions.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.600
But Nicole's
an incredible student.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.240
Who cares if she
doesn't make honor roll?

02:25.240 --> 02:26.200
She does.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.120
Her parents do.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.000
Personally,
I don't do well

02:30.000 --> 02:31.760
with that kind
of pressure.

02:31.760 --> 02:32.720
I totally wilt.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.480
Anything we can do
to help?

02:34.480 --> 02:36.080
When Nicole
gets like that

02:36.080 --> 02:37.040
she's a wreck.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.400
You can't talk
to her.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.840
And we're
not the ones

02:39.840 --> 02:42.120
to help with her math,
are we, Alex?

02:42.120 --> 02:43.440
Yeah, I guess not.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.920
<i>Mr. Mack:
I couldn't believe it myself.</i>

02:45.920 --> 02:48.440
GC-161 is a far more powerful
substance

02:48.440 --> 02:50.440
than any of us first thought.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.600
I see.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.960
From everything
that I can see

02:54.960 --> 02:56.560
GC-161 could alter

02:56.560 --> 02:59.240
human genetic structure.

02:59.240 --> 03:02.560
Can I assume this is
good news you're telling me?

03:02.560 --> 03:03.480
Not exactly.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.880
The Chemical may now fall into

03:05.880 --> 03:08.600
a group
of class-d substances

03:08.600 --> 03:10.560
that the government
won't allow

03:10.560 --> 03:12.200
much experimentation on.

03:12.200 --> 03:15.440
As usual, very good work, Mack.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.720
I want you to put GC-161
aside now.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.480
Do you have another project
you can work on?

03:20.480 --> 03:22.440
The household projects
division

03:22.440 --> 03:23.560
asked me to look

03:23.560 --> 03:26.120
at toxic levels
in our new air freshener.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.320
You do that.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.320
Oh, just one more thing,
Miss Atron.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.200
Remember
that truck accident

03:32.200 --> 03:34.040
last year
near the schools?

03:34.040 --> 03:35.960
There was a rumor
going around

03:35.960 --> 03:38.000
that a child
was possibly doused

03:38.000 --> 03:40.920
with an enormous amount
of GC-161.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.440
If that's true

03:42.440 --> 03:44.880
I fear for that child.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.520
<i>That was only a rumor.</i>

03:46.520 --> 03:48.440
And it happened long ago.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.840
If anything serious
had happened

03:50.840 --> 03:53.680
someone would have
come forward by now.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.760
I guess so.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.080
I'll stay in touch.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.600
And in the meantime

03:58.600 --> 04:00.200
keep this
to yourself.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.320
All right?

04:05.520 --> 04:07.680
Vince, get in here immediately.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.399
Annie:
Nicole, wait.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.200
Nicole?

04:19.680 --> 04:20.920
What happened?

04:20.920 --> 04:22.160
She came over to see

04:22.160 --> 04:24.000
if I could help her
with trig

04:24.000 --> 04:25.520
so I explained it
to her

04:25.520 --> 04:26.840
and after ten minutes

04:26.840 --> 04:28.520
she got really
frustrated.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.680
What did you do?

04:29.680 --> 04:30.680
Nothing.

04:30.680 --> 04:31.720
I was very nice.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.320
It's so strange.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.600
It's not.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.280
It happens a lot
at my school.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.400
Some kids are
such great students

04:38.400 --> 04:39.880
but they get
overwhelmed

04:39.880 --> 04:41.840
with this pressure
to succeed.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.520
It can be
debilitating.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.600
Can be what?

04:44.600 --> 04:47.560
It can prevent you
from doing anything.

04:47.560 --> 04:50.360
Why can't you
just say that, then?

04:58.560 --> 05:00.640
<i>( Dialing phone )</i>

05:03.520 --> 05:04.880
Hi, Ray?

05:04.880 --> 05:06.520
It's me.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.360
I need you to go back to school
with me.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.480
I know you just escaped
from there

05:11.480 --> 05:13.000
but we have to.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.840
It's for Nicole.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.160
We knew this would
happen eventually.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.120
I didn't think

05:18.120 --> 05:19.560
it would happen
so soon.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.480
Mack's good
at what he does.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.040
Can we trust him?

05:23.040 --> 05:25.840
He seems loyal
to the organization.

05:25.840 --> 05:26.800
But...

05:26.800 --> 05:28.240
But you can't
be sure.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.360
Exactly.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.600
See, he mentioned
the truck accident

05:31.600 --> 05:33.400
and his concern
over the kid

05:33.400 --> 05:35.120
splashed
with the chemical.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.920
Why would he care
about that?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.280
Unfortunately, Vince

05:38.280 --> 05:39.280
some people have

05:39.280 --> 05:41.160
what's known
as a conscience.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.800
Miss Atron,
I'm in charge

05:42.800 --> 05:44.880
of protecting
the Plant's security

05:44.880 --> 05:46.160
and this strikes me

05:46.160 --> 05:48.360
as a great threat
to the GC project.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.400
Although nothing
in Mack's files

05:50.400 --> 05:51.520
indicates a problem

05:51.520 --> 05:54.520
I think he needs
to be monitored closely.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.240
Agreed.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.560
I want a plan
by the end of the day.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.160
And you
will have one.

06:07.640 --> 06:08.960
I can't believe you.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.120
Ray, keep it down.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.000
I ask you
to help me like this

06:12.000 --> 06:13.360
and you
turn me down.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.040
This is different.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.000
No, it's not.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.600
You're stealing
the test.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.440
That's all I
wanted you to do.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.560
First of all

06:20.560 --> 06:22.800
Nicole works hard
at her school work.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.800
And you don't.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.760
That's why
I need the help more.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.480
You'd want
to steal the test

06:27.480 --> 06:28.840
to cheat
right off it.

06:28.840 --> 06:31.280
I'll just use it
to help her study.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.280
I won't even tell her
I have it.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.440
What a waste.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.040
Just keep a lookout,
okay?

06:36.040 --> 06:37.000
If anyone comes

06:37.000 --> 06:38.160
knock on the door.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.240
Just be quick.

07:18.680 --> 07:19.600
Raymond!

07:19.600 --> 07:20.560
Oh, uh-uh...

07:20.560 --> 07:21.880
Hi, Mr. Sperry.

07:21.880 --> 07:22.840
How are you?

07:22.840 --> 07:23.800
I'm fine, Ray.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.440
What are you doing here?

07:25.440 --> 07:27.440
School's been out
for some time.

07:27.440 --> 07:28.800
Uh, I forgot a book.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.280
Uh, I was hoping
I'd run into you.

07:33.280 --> 07:34.240
You have.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.400
Excuse me?

07:35.400 --> 07:38.040
You've run into me.
What can I do for you?

07:38.040 --> 07:40.160
You really never
congratulated me

07:40.160 --> 07:42.080
on my final grade
last semester.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.360
Your final grade?

07:43.360 --> 07:44.840
I believe you got a C-plus.

07:44.840 --> 07:45.800
I know.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.000
If you saw
what I'm getting now

07:48.000 --> 07:50.480
you'd know what
an achievement that was.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.440
It was nice talking to you
about the old days.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.360
<i>I know my day
is now complete.</i>

07:56.720 --> 07:58.040
Bye.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.000

touch, Mr. Sperry.

Annie:
Nicole... hi.

08:57.120 --> 08:57.840
Hi.

08:58.520 --> 09:00.240
Did you come
to study some more?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.280
Um...
Actually

09:01.280 --> 09:03.840
I came to study
with Alex.

09:03.840 --> 09:04.800
With
Alex...

09:04.800 --> 09:05.920
Yeah.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.880
We're okay.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.880
You can go now.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.080
Just... go.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.120
Okay.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.080
Alex,
this is crazy.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.920
I know you're
worried about me

09:14.920 --> 09:17.360
but there's not much
you can do to help.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.400
I think I can.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.920
Annie had sperry for trig

09:19.920 --> 09:22.520
and gave me some areas
you should focus on.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.800
What good
would it do?

09:23.800 --> 09:25.200
You know sperry brags

09:25.200 --> 09:27.720
about how he never
gives the same test.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.280
Please let me help.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.200
I really think I can help you.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.800
I guess it couldn't hurt.

09:33.800 --> 09:34.840
Great.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.240
We'll start with
polar coordinates.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.720
Alex, we didn't spend
that much time

09:41.720 --> 09:43.200
on polar coordinates.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.240
Trust me.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.080
Mr. Mack:
I had no idea

09:49.080 --> 09:51.360
GC-161 contained
those properties.

09:51.360 --> 09:54.160
To tell you the truth,
it's frightening.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.480
What's up, Dad?

09:55.480 --> 09:57.920
Oh, it's something
I discovered at work

09:57.920 --> 09:59.160
about GC-161.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.040
George,
what are you saying?

10:02.040 --> 10:03.080
This chemical

10:03.080 --> 10:05.440
you've been working on
can actually

10:05.440 --> 10:08.080
change our genetic makeup,
our DNA?

10:08.080 --> 10:09.760
Believe it or not, yes.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.840
And someone may
be exposed to it

10:11.840 --> 10:12.840
in large doses.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.200
Oh, you mean
the child

10:14.200 --> 10:15.800
in the truck accident.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.800
Right.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.000
Who knows how
it'll affect him?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.040
I feel guilty
for being involved

10:21.040 --> 10:22.080
in the research.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.280
Don't feel guilty.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.840
You were doing your job.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.040
If a kid was contaminated
by GC-161

10:27.040 --> 10:29.400
he'd need regular
and complex testing

10:29.400 --> 10:30.960
to make sure
he was okay.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.880
Well, maybe
that's happening.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.520
I know you're trying
to make me feel better

10:35.520 --> 10:38.600
but only a few of us
know anything about GC-161.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.800
Well, you know more

10:39.800 --> 10:41.640
than most
of our researchers.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.720
To think that...

10:43.720 --> 10:47.000
I could've had any involvement
at all in...

10:47.000 --> 10:50.120
In ruining
some kid's life.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.480
It will be fine, Dad.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.800
If some kid was harmed

10:52.800 --> 10:54.600
we would have heard about it.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.200
Annie's right, George.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.480
I hope so.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.920
I really hope so.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.800
<i>Vince:
I'm worried about Mack.</i>

11:05.800 --> 11:08.400
His office phone calls
have been monitored

11:08.400 --> 11:10.320
and he's
not saying anything

11:10.320 --> 11:11.760
about GC-161,
but...

11:11.760 --> 11:13.600
But... who knows
what happens

11:13.600 --> 11:14.840
when he gets home?

11:16.440 --> 11:17.960
Exactly.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.840
I think a few well-placed
surveillance devices

11:20.840 --> 11:24.040
could go a long way
to easing our concerns.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.920
I don't know what you're
talking about, Vince.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.200
But... I approve
of your judgment.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.920
And I appreciate
that approval.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.000
Starting
tomorrow

11:33.000 --> 11:35.120
we will hear
just about everything

11:35.120 --> 11:37.120
coming out
of the Mack home.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.600
Alex:
We'll study more tomorrow.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.840
Thank you so much.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.840
Bye.

11:51.320 --> 11:52.720
We've got to talk.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.200
What's up?

11:54.200 --> 11:57.280
Dad made this huge
discovery today

11:57.280 --> 11:58.320
about GC-161.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.040
He knows
how powerful it is.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.240
He's upset
about the kid

12:02.240 --> 12:03.680
that got hit by the truck.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.840
You mean me?

12:04.840 --> 12:05.640
Yeah, you.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.520
He doesn't know it's you

12:07.520 --> 12:09.240
although I almost told him.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.920
Annie, are you
sure I'm okay

12:10.920 --> 12:12.920
and not going to
blow up someday?

12:12.920 --> 12:14.680
Yeah, I'm sure.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.560
I mean, I'm pretty sure.

12:17.560 --> 12:20.200
I'm sure as I can be.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.880
<i>( Tires screech )</i>

12:31.880 --> 12:32.840
Mm-hmm.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.640
<i>( Truck door closes )</i>

12:39.800 --> 12:42.200
<i>( Doorbell rings )
Mm-hmm.</i>

12:42.200 --> 12:45.200
Okay, so did you
remember to study

12:45.200 --> 12:46.520
solving inequalities?

12:46.520 --> 12:47.920
All right.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.840
<i>( Doorbell rings )
Try number two in our book.</i>

12:49.840 --> 12:51.080
I'll get it.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.240
Hello.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.160
<i>( With Southern accent ):
There's phone line</i>

12:58.160 --> 12:59.400
trouble in the area.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.480
Take me a second
to check your wires.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.960
Come on in.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.640
There's a jack
over here.

13:04.640 --> 13:05.600
Alex.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.720
The phone man
needs the phone.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.680
So all you have to do

13:09.680 --> 13:12.680
is study the chapter
on identities.

13:12.680 --> 13:13.760
Okay, bye.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.400
<i>So, you're
helping Nicole.</i>

13:20.360 --> 13:21.880
Alex:
She's my friend.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.480
She's comfortable with me.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.800
You'd make her nervous.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.320
Annie, when
you helped her

13:26.320 --> 13:28.280
she went running
from the house.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.080
I better check
the one upstairs, too.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.440
Oh, okay, sure,
follow me.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.400
Alex:
You're right.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.440
That's why I'm glad

13:36.440 --> 13:39.720
I have an advance
copy of the test.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.480
What?

13:41.480 --> 13:42.440
How?

13:42.440 --> 13:45.080
Well, I was
worried about her.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.840
So yesterday
after school

13:47.840 --> 13:49.320
I sort of snuck back in

13:49.320 --> 13:51.200
and got into Sperry's office

13:51.200 --> 13:52.200
and took it.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.040
Alex, I cannot believe

13:54.040 --> 13:57.400
that you would do
something so unethical.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.600
And how did you get
into the classroom?

14:00.600 --> 14:02.320
Alex:
How do you think I got in?

14:02.320 --> 14:03.480
I used my powers.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.760
Louis:
Wait till you see this.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.240
People will make total
jerks of themselves

14:08.240 --> 14:09.520
for ten bucks.

14:09.520 --> 14:10.920
I used to do this
all the time

14:10.920 --> 14:12.120
back in Cincinnati.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.240
Someone's coming.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.080
<i>( Fishing reel clicks )</i>

14:17.080 --> 14:17.960
<i>( Ray giggles )</i>

14:17.960 --> 14:19.200
<i>( Reel clicking )</i>

14:19.200 --> 14:20.560
<i>( Giggling )</i>

14:23.720 --> 14:25.720
<i>( Both cackling )</i>

14:25.720 --> 14:28.920
That's great.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.000
Well, everything
checked out here.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.760
If you hear
a slight clicking

14:32.760 --> 14:34.320
in your phone
for a while

14:34.320 --> 14:35.680
just ignore it.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.560
Okay, well,
thanks so much.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.040
Can you see
yourself out?

14:39.040 --> 14:40.000
Of course.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.040
Okay.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.840
I almost got caught.

14:46.840 --> 14:47.840
Sperry came in

14:47.840 --> 14:49.840
and I didn't have
time to morph.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.280
I was sending out zappers

14:51.280 --> 14:52.480
shutting off lights

14:52.480 --> 14:53.960
trying to hide in the dark.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.640
Annie:
You sound proud, Alex.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.040
Are you ever going to stop

14:58.040 --> 15:00.320
using your powers in public?

15:00.320 --> 15:03.040
<i>( Snickering )</i>

15:03.040 --> 15:05.640
Hey, some guy's coming
out of Alex's house.

15:05.640 --> 15:06.400
Do it again.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.360
No problemo.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.400
<i>( Fishing reel clicks )</i>

15:09.400 --> 15:10.320
Oh, ho-ho.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.720
Some poor slob lost a ten spot.

15:12.720 --> 15:13.680
What?

15:19.840 --> 15:21.160
Uh-oh!

15:21.160 --> 15:22.320
<i>( Grunting )</i>

15:22.320 --> 15:24.360
Come back here, punk!

15:28.600 --> 15:29.680
<i>( Screaming )</i>

15:29.680 --> 15:31.280
You're mine, punk!

15:32.680 --> 15:35.760
<i>( Screaming in distance )</i>

15:39.680 --> 15:40.360
Annie!

15:41.600 --> 15:44.280
You know Vince just came
out of your house?

15:44.280 --> 15:45.280
Vince?

15:45.280 --> 15:46.520
Oh no.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.440
<i>( Beeping )</i>

15:47.440 --> 15:48.840
Alex:
What is it?

15:48.840 --> 15:49.720
What is it?

15:49.720 --> 15:50.920
That so-called
phone guy

15:50.920 --> 15:51.840
was Vince

15:51.840 --> 15:53.120
and he just bugged
our house

15:53.120 --> 15:54.440
probably to tape Dad.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.360
Wow!

15:55.360 --> 15:56.560
Good thing
you found it

15:56.560 --> 15:58.480
before we said
anything stupid.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.880
Alex, we already said
something stupid.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.240
After he planted this

16:02.240 --> 16:03.960
you told me
power by power

16:03.960 --> 16:06.200
how you stole that
test for Nicole!

16:13.160 --> 16:14.080
Where is he?

16:14.080 --> 16:15.280
Chasing Louis.

16:15.280 --> 16:18.440
I don't even want
to know the details.

16:25.680 --> 16:26.760
Quick, Ray, here's
what we'll do.

16:26.760 --> 16:29.880
<i>( Dog barking in distance )</i>

16:29.880 --> 16:32.080
<i>( Birds chirping )</i>

16:35.440 --> 16:36.480
Can I help you?

16:36.480 --> 16:38.000
You with the
phone company?

16:38.000 --> 16:38.960
Yes.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.120
Good. We have
problems

16:40.120 --> 16:41.960
with the lines
at my house.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.120
Could you
take a look?

16:43.120 --> 16:44.800
I'm off to
another job.

16:44.800 --> 16:45.640
Please.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.880
Guess you didn't
hear me.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.480
I said, I don't
have time.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.040
Are you sure you're
with the phone company?

16:51.040 --> 16:52.240
Yes, I'm sure.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.680
Because if you can't
take a look at my phone

16:54.680 --> 16:57.480
I'll just take down
your license plate number

16:57.480 --> 16:59.200
and talk to
your supervisor.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.120
I, I guess I can
spare a minute.

17:02.120 --> 17:02.880
Good.

get inside.

If we make a presentation

17:16.400 --> 17:18.359
on the third

17:18.359 --> 17:21.640
that'll give us two weeks
to deliver.

Man:
I think we can make it.

17:23.599 --> 17:24.640
Mrs. Mack:
Tomorrow we can

17:24.640 --> 17:26.520
go over this again.

17:26.520 --> 17:27.480
Do me a favor

17:27.480 --> 17:30.360
and transfer me to Rick?

17:30.360 --> 17:32.520
Man:
Hi, this is Rick.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.160
Mrs. Mack:
Rick, I need to push

17:34.160 --> 17:36.480
my 3:00 Monday to 4:30.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.240
Can you do that for me?

17:38.240 --> 17:41.400
Rick:
Sure, anything else?

17:41.400 --> 17:44.040
Vince: Nothing we can
do about that, chief.

17:44.040 --> 17:48.520
Ray: ...Someone who
knows what he's doing.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.800
I told you yes.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.480
Now will you just
leave me alone?

What's wrong
with you?

18:58.760 --> 19:00.080
I'm feeling
a little guilty.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.200
Nicole's brilliant

19:01.200 --> 19:02.320
and I've given her

19:02.320 --> 19:03.560
this unfair
advantage

19:03.560 --> 19:05.160
over the rest
of the class.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.480
If she makes honor roll
because of this

19:07.480 --> 19:08.920
it won't mean anything.

19:08.920 --> 19:11.880
Hey, I've seen this test before.

19:11.880 --> 19:12.840
I showed you.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.000
No, I took it last semester.

19:15.000 --> 19:15.960
It was ugly.

19:15.960 --> 19:16.800
You said

19:16.800 --> 19:17.800
sperry never gives

19:17.800 --> 19:19.240
the same test twice.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.280
He doesn't.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.000
This test says,
"first semester."

19:22.000 --> 19:24.120
We're in the second
semester now.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.120
Alex, what's up?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.040
You don't have to
worry about me.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.520
You really did help.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.120
I'm totally psyched.

19:40.120 --> 19:43.080
Yeah, well, you don't have to
concentrate too much

19:43.080 --> 19:44.680

What?

19:46.880 --> 19:48.640
Now you tell me, right?

19:48.640 --> 19:51.040
Look, I'm just saying,
you know...

Luck!

19:52.800 --> 19:54.080
I'll never steal again.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.520
I'll never
steal again.

20:01.240 --> 20:03.640
<i>( Rings )</i>

20:09.360 --> 20:10.840
So how'd you do?

20:10.840 --> 20:12.520
He didn't test us

20:12.520 --> 20:16.320
on a single thing
you told me he would.

20:19.880 --> 20:20.840
<i>( Laughing )</i>

20:20.840 --> 20:22.960
Dad, will you tell us
that story

20:22.960 --> 20:25.840
about when you went
bowling with scooter

20:25.840 --> 20:28.960
and you got your fingers
stuck in the ball?

20:28.960 --> 20:30.560
<i>Annie, dear...
( Chuckles )</i>

20:30.560 --> 20:34.560
I think we've all heard that one
quite enough, don't you?

20:34.560 --> 20:37.720
No, Mom, I'd actually
like to hear it again.

20:37.720 --> 20:38.960
Sure, if you want.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.000
It seems like you're
asking to hear

20:41.000 --> 20:43.040
all my favorite stories tonight.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.200
Well, we both went
looking for a ball

20:45.200 --> 20:46.880
and there weren't many left.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.040
So I picked up
this really small one

20:49.040 --> 20:50.920
<i>( beeping )
And before I knew it</i>

20:50.920 --> 20:52.600
<i>( snickering )
I had my thumb</i>

20:52.600 --> 20:54.440
wedged in the hole
in the ball.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.120
I thought it would come off

20:56.120 --> 20:57.320
when I rolled it

20:57.320 --> 20:59.080
but I went flying
into the alley.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.280
<i>( Giggling )</i>

21:01.280 --> 21:04.280
You know, they really
grease those things up

21:04.280 --> 21:05.760
with polyurethane.

21:05.760 --> 21:09.200
So, they called for the manager
and it took him 15...

21:09.200 --> 21:12.160
So, do we have anything
to worry about?

21:12.160 --> 21:13.960
No, and I have listened

21:13.960 --> 21:15.960
to hours and
hours of tapes

21:15.960 --> 21:19.440
and not only has he not
once mentioned GC-161

21:19.440 --> 21:22.320
he is also the most
boring human being

21:22.320 --> 21:24.240
I have ever come across.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.800
Okay, Vince,
you can back off.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.760
For now.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.800
<i>( No audio )</i>

21:32.560 --> 21:34.760
Mr. Mack:
...you have to realize

21:34.760 --> 21:36.480
how cold the water was.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.000
<i>( Knocking at door )</i>

21:38.000 --> 21:39.560
<i>( Clicks off )</i>

21:39.560 --> 21:40.840
Yeah?

21:40.840 --> 21:42.480
It's Nicole.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.440
Oh, no.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.360
Come in.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.120
Hi.

21:48.280 --> 21:49.000
Hi.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.000
<i>( Sighs )</i>

21:51.000 --> 21:53.520
You know, like I
told you, Alex

21:53.520 --> 21:55.600
you totally led me
in the wrong direction.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.480
I'm sorry, Nicole.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.600
The good news is

21:59.600 --> 22:00.920
I didn't need you.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.280
Sperry called me--

22:02.280 --> 22:04.360
I got a 96 anyway.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.200
Oh my gosh!

22:05.200 --> 22:06.280
That's great!

22:06.280 --> 22:07.920
Congratulations.

22:07.920 --> 22:08.600
Thanks.

22:08.600 --> 22:09.960
I asked your mom

22:09.960 --> 22:12.360
if I could buy you
a soda to celebrate.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.280
You up for it?

22:13.280 --> 22:13.960
Definitely.

22:13.960 --> 22:14.840
See you later.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.440
Okay, see you.
