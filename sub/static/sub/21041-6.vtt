00:00.010 --> 00:02.990
She's messing with some
pretty powerful people here.

00:03.040 --> 00:04.140
They wanna shut her up, they can.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.310
This was Linda's boyfriend.
He was with US Air Force.

00:08.360 --> 00:11.310
I didn't hurt Linda. I
could never hurt her.

00:11.360 --> 00:12.830
We were in love.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.430
Bradley's a sideshow here, you know that.
Don't make the cover-up worse than the crime.

00:16.480 --> 00:20.190
He's done it. The Iraq
veteran, the young backbencher,

00:20.240 --> 00:21.750
has just won!

00:21.800 --> 00:26.150
He's the real thing, where
your investment should lie.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.030
- How did you even get to know Linda?
- Her uncle.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.390
Phil Simms. You saw Linda
that night, didn't you?

00:32.439 --> 00:34.190
I dropped him off. I drove away.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.590
- Who else?
- Linda's friend.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.110
Rachel Leigh.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.270
Do you remember the autopsy
report? She was buried here.

00:41.320 --> 00:45.270
If you were exposed, you and
your bloody sinister cabal...

00:45.320 --> 00:50.670
Why would we kill a girl, even by
accident, then conceal the facts?

00:50.720 --> 00:53.710
You're scared. Is it for yourself,
or is it for someone else?

00:53.760 --> 00:55.550
Get out!

00:55.600 --> 00:57.670
Met the love of my life here.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.240
And then I lost him.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.030
You were 18. It would
have ruined your life.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.830
Now how do we know what it
would have done to my life?

01:04.879 --> 01:07.990
They're trying to hide something
that happened weeks before the war.

01:08.040 --> 01:10.110
There was security business
on the base that night.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.110
Private planes landing. VIPs.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.030
Why did they come to the UK?

01:14.080 --> 01:18.790
There is no interest in investigating
what happened 14 years ago.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.680
We need to find Rachel
Leigh. She told a big fat lie.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.520
Annie was right.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.510
I should have left him in jail.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.910
Dreaming of glory?

05:06.960 --> 05:09.640
Still a long way to go and
a great deal to be done.

05:13.640 --> 05:17.390
Alastair told me that Banville
knows, that she worked it out.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.830
How?

05:18.880 --> 05:23.070
It doesn't matter. She can't do anything
about it, because A: nobody cares

05:23.120 --> 05:25.600
and B: she can't connect it to the girl.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.390
Nothing connects to the girl.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.440
Not quite nothing.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.390
That's another issue, isn't it?

05:35.440 --> 05:38.920
You, at least, are in the clear,
as long as you hold your nerve.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.520
Do you think Banville will just give up?

05:44.520 --> 05:47.000
Her client's dead, her credibility's shot.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.080
Any normal person would.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.550
- So, will you head back
to the States? - Mm-mm.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.190
- Not yet.
- I think you should.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.830
You think I don't want to?

05:59.880 --> 06:04.470
That I wouldn't rather be with my children,
instead of wading through all this...

06:04.520 --> 06:06.110
this shit?

06:09.760 --> 06:11.750
You still need me.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.800
What if she doesn't give up?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.280
Then I'll drop a fucking rock on her head.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.230
The Kevin Russell case is now closed.

06:30.280 --> 06:33.710

the bill by the end of the week.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.710

06:35.760 --> 06:37.150
Yes.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.670
As far the Attars are concerned...

06:39.720 --> 06:41.840
I assume we'll just take the loss?

06:44.960 --> 06:46.240
Emma?

06:52.720 --> 06:54.350
Emma? Emma?

06:54.400 --> 06:55.880
Sorry.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.350
Em? Is that you, love?

07:01.400 --> 07:02.600
Yeah.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.920
'February '03, I was working
in the Cabinet Office.'

07:16.320 --> 07:20.630
'I met a chap called Kretchmer
from the US Department of Defense

07:20.680 --> 07:26.120
and an Iraqi scientist, he had information
about Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons.'

07:27.360 --> 07:29.630
'Who else was there that evening?'

07:29.680 --> 07:32.950
'There were some British and
American intelligence officers.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.630
Even if I knew their
names, I wouldn't tell you.'

07:35.680 --> 07:37.670
'You're still missing someone.'

07:38.720 --> 07:39.550
'Why would we?

07:39.600 --> 07:44.870
Kill a girl, even by accident, and
then conceal the facts, lie about it?

07:44.920 --> 07:47.000
Tell me, why?'

07:49.520 --> 07:51.310
'You're scared.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.630
- Why?
- Get out!

07:52.680 --> 07:54.950
Is it for yourself or
is it for someone else?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.590
Get out!'

07:57.240 --> 07:59.760
'Who else was there that evening?'

08:15.640 --> 08:17.960
'I'm scared, Daddy, really scared.'

08:21.760 --> 08:24.630
'It's OK. Trust me.'

08:24.680 --> 08:26.880
Daddy, I'm scared.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.440
I'm so scared, Daddy.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.390
Daddy, what is it?'

08:33.440 --> 08:35.590
'Oh, Daddy!'

08:35.640 --> 08:37.240
'Trust me.'

08:43.159 --> 08:45.590
'You can't keep the baby now, you can't.'

08:49.120 --> 08:50.720
'Trust me.'

09:00.960 --> 09:02.950
I had the dream again.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.270
Me on the wall. My dad.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.030
The photograph.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.750
How did it end?

09:08.800 --> 09:10.470
It didn't. It never does.

09:10.520 --> 09:13.990
And he's gonna die soon and
it's all gonna be left unsaid.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.630
Then why don't you talk
to him, have it out?

09:16.680 --> 09:19.590
Yeah, but it's gonna upset him too much.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.720
Well, not doing it is gonna
be worse, for both of you.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.240
Yeah.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.480
This is just silly.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.520
Come to bed.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.630
The best sausages you've ever ever had!

09:41.680 --> 09:43.670
- I'll be the judge of that.
- Thank you.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.720
- Ignore that.
- (Thank you.)

09:50.240 --> 09:52.040
I knew it. Typical.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.790
- Yeah?
- 'It's Olivia Greenwood.'

09:54.840 --> 09:57.350
- What do you want?
- 'I heard about Kevin Russell.'

09:57.400 --> 09:58.830
I'm sorry.

09:58.880 --> 10:03.030
Look, I know this is probably irrelevant.
because you'll have moved on...

10:03.080 --> 10:06.750
No. It was you who moved on. I tried to
find you, I only got that fool Staines.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.710
Do you want to hear what I've got?

10:08.760 --> 10:10.510
OK.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.630
I found Rachel Leigh's mother.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.270
A nursing home in Finchley.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.760
- Are you gonna go and talk to her?
- I can't.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.760
I've been suspended.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.000
- Do you want the address or not?
- Yeah.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.320
St Agatha's, Milburn Road, Finchley.

10:31.400 --> 10:35.470
Just so you know, the home said she has
dementia, so... It may be a waste of time.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.990
If I find anything, do
you want me to call you?

10:40.760 --> 10:42.560
Yeah. Keep me informed.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.990
Sorry about all this.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.040
What do you want?

10:55.440 --> 10:58.740
I had an odd conversation with
that American woman, Heather Myles.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.750
What was odd about it?

11:01.800 --> 11:03.590
Her interest in Banville.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.760
In the threat that Miriam
Attar made against Banville.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.080
She seemed to take it seriously, but
we haven't, it just didn't seem...

11:14.080 --> 11:16.430
So maybe you should just
be honest with me for once.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.120
Why is this woman so
interested in Banville?

11:22.760 --> 11:24.550
Does she have many visitors?

11:24.600 --> 11:27.800
Not while I've been here,
which is more than three years.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.110
And does she ever mention her family?

11:31.160 --> 11:34.160
She hasn't mentioned anyone.
She's in her own world.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.920
Not more than ten minutes. OK?

11:37.920 --> 11:39.320
Maureen?

11:48.360 --> 11:53.550
'.. tonight's programme, Matthew Wild,
the man everyone is saying could be...'

11:53.600 --> 11:55.920
Hello, Maureen, I'm Emma Banville.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.510
Why has she taken my breakfast?

12:02.560 --> 12:04.680
Erm... Can I talk to you?

12:05.680 --> 12:07.270
She did, you know.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.400
Every last... last bit, the greedy beast.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.910
I'd like to show you something.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.990
No, no. Not hungry.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.240
A photo.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.960
Do you recognise either of these girls?

12:30.960 --> 12:33.840
That's your daughter
Rachel, with the dark hair.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.720
Do you know where she is?

12:39.840 --> 12:41.230
Do you...

12:41.280 --> 12:44.710
'.. I would stop us ever
making the same mistake again.'

12:44.760 --> 12:47.230
- When did you last see Rachel?
- Sssh.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.270
Sssh. Sssh. Sssh.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.550
' Well, the day I first met my wife.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.950
My whole life changed.'

12:55.000 --> 12:57.070
'Do you remember that day?'

12:57.120 --> 12:59.270
- Why? Why? Why?
- 'Yeah. Absolutely.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.910
She was handing out leaflets and
knocking on doors in the pouring rain...'

13:02.960 --> 13:04.960
Why has she changed her hair?

13:05.960 --> 13:12.070
'Well, I did win and Laura and I are
in it together now for the long haul.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.910
For better or for worse.'

13:13.960 --> 13:17.950
'So that's where we leave them,
the new leader and his family,

13:18.000 --> 13:23.200
in a brief moment of relaxation before he
starts the biggest battle of his career.'

13:33.860 --> 13:35.860
How did you become her?

14:29.060 --> 14:30.650
Douglas, it's Emma.

14:30.700 --> 14:34.530
Yeah. I'm sorry to call you so
late. I've got another favour.

14:34.580 --> 14:40.740
Matthew Wild. Now, I know he was in
the Army in 2003, but where was he?

14:52.580 --> 14:55.570
- Hello, Heather.
- Laura, this is not a good idea.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.290
Banville knows.

14:57.340 --> 14:59.210
She went to see my mother.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.570
Well, your mother is
hardly in a state to talk...

15:01.620 --> 15:05.130
I have security software which
monitors searches in my name.

15:05.180 --> 15:08.290
After she saw her, she went
online. She searched for me.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.700
You said you'd look after me. Remember?

15:11.700 --> 15:13.370
My silence -- your protection.

15:13.420 --> 15:16.130
We gave you a new life
abroad, away from all this.

15:16.180 --> 15:20.010
But then you've made protecting you a hell of a lot more
difficult, haven't you, by diving right back into the middle of it?

15:20.060 --> 15:22.900
I'd been away ten years.
I wanted to come home.

15:24.220 --> 15:28.210
Did "home" have to include throwing
yourself in front of Matthew Wild?

15:28.260 --> 15:30.730
- I fell in love.
- Love? Don't make me laugh.

15:30.780 --> 15:33.450
You saw your meal ticket
and you grabbed it.

15:33.500 --> 15:37.890
The cute little party worker, you just fell
right at his feet with your legs wide open.

15:37.940 --> 15:40.840
Did you tell him who you were
before or after you fucked him?

15:43.700 --> 15:45.890
I'm not the problem.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.650
OK?

15:47.700 --> 15:49.700
The problem is Banville.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.530
So...

15:52.580 --> 15:54.530
what are you going to do?

15:54.580 --> 15:57.050
I'll have people watching
her. Don't worry.

15:57.100 --> 15:59.980
She may call you. If she
does, call me with this.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.580
Stay calm. Keep your nerve.

16:18.340 --> 16:21.210
The souls of the just
are in the hand of God.

16:21.260 --> 16:23.050
They seemed to be dead

16:23.100 --> 16:29.260
and their passing away was an affliction
and their going from us utter destruction.

16:30.580 --> 16:32.180
But they are in peace.

16:33.180 --> 16:38.100
For if before men they be punished,
yet is their hope full of immortality.

16:39.420 --> 16:43.020
Because God tried them and
found them worthy of himself.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.170
I told you we should have kept
her locked up in the States.

16:47.220 --> 16:51.170
If we'd kept her here, she
would have become the story.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.650
Which would have meant even
more questions, wouldn't it?

16:53.700 --> 16:55.810
- You heard she got to Alastair?
- Yes.

16:55.860 --> 16:57.370
To what effect?

16:57.420 --> 17:00.170
None. Alastair kept his nerve.

17:00.220 --> 17:04.369
Everyone has to keep their
nerve, including you.

17:04.420 --> 17:08.569
My nerve is fine, thank you. It's
others whom I can't guarantee.

17:08.619 --> 17:11.810
- And she's sniffing around them now.
- So, what's the answer?

17:11.859 --> 17:13.730
Why don't you tell me, sir?

17:13.780 --> 17:17.170
This is your area,
Heather, damage control.

17:17.220 --> 17:19.690
So control the damage.

17:26.099 --> 17:30.330
'.. then five minutes later, he was
arrested by the terrorist police.'

17:30.380 --> 17:32.850
'Emma always warned Yusef
he was running a huge risk.'

17:32.900 --> 17:34.890
'But I'm telling you what they say.

17:34.940 --> 17:37.730
Now Emma is the one
who's running the risk.'

17:39.500 --> 17:42.770
It's me. That extra
resource I requested at GCHQ?

17:42.820 --> 17:44.810
Not necessary any more.

17:49.020 --> 17:50.610
This is huge, Em.

17:50.660 --> 17:52.490
Are you gonna confront her?

17:52.540 --> 17:54.020
Not yet.

17:56.140 --> 17:58.540
I'm still waiting for
a piece of the puzzle.

18:03.820 --> 18:05.580
We've got company.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.300
My condolences.

18:19.380 --> 18:20.860
He's over there.

18:21.820 --> 18:23.820
Why don't you give them to him yourself?

18:26.300 --> 18:27.780
I will.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.340
What is it?

18:33.220 --> 18:35.530
We're aware of a threat made against you.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.170
Miriam Attar.

18:37.220 --> 18:38.690
I told her.

18:38.740 --> 18:40.730
What are you doing about it?

18:40.780 --> 18:42.180
Nothing.

18:43.420 --> 18:47.090
I represent child killers,
terrorists, rapists.

18:47.140 --> 18:50.130
I get shit through my letter box,
I get bricks through the window.

18:50.180 --> 18:52.770
Have you noticed anyone
following you or watching you?

18:52.820 --> 18:54.820
You mean, apart from the police?

18:56.100 --> 18:58.090
I'll deny ever saying this,

18:58.140 --> 19:03.100
but if you were surveilled that one
time, that is no longer the case.

19:04.380 --> 19:06.210
What are you saying?

19:06.260 --> 19:08.090
You need to be careful.

19:08.140 --> 19:10.130
Check your car before you drive.

19:10.180 --> 19:11.730
Vary your routes.

19:11.780 --> 19:14.410
And don't open any unexpected packages.

19:14.460 --> 19:17.820
You're saying Yusef Attar's people
would follow through on this?

19:18.540 --> 19:20.970
I'm saying it would be
made to look like them.

19:21.020 --> 19:22.890
So watch yourself.

19:22.940 --> 19:24.410
For how long?

19:24.460 --> 19:26.060
- That depends.
- On what?

19:27.780 --> 19:30.100
Have you really buried Russell?

19:31.580 --> 19:33.180
I don't know.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.900
Then be careful.

19:51.580 --> 19:53.210
- What's going on?
- I'm off.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.810
- Back to the Middle East desk.
- What about Ruby?

19:55.860 --> 19:58.050
Well, she's off the list.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.780
No longer a person of
interest, apparently.

20:01.780 --> 20:04.450
And now there's no one watching over her.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.100
Not even us.

20:11.180 --> 20:13.170
I'm sending you a file.

20:13.220 --> 20:16.220
Start laying a trail. Get on it now.

20:18.980 --> 20:21.250
Are you guys outside her house?

20:21.300 --> 20:23.700
'Yeah. For now.'

20:31.300 --> 20:33.300
Poor Kev. I liked him, you know.

20:35.820 --> 20:38.890
What do you think they're
gonna put on his gravestone?

20:38.940 --> 20:40.740
Annie hasn't decided yet.

20:41.820 --> 20:43.410
Is that the time?

20:43.460 --> 20:46.780
Nearly kick-off. I was gonna
see the lads in the pub, but...

20:47.860 --> 20:49.860
.. I'm not that bothered, really.

20:54.660 --> 20:56.130
Go on.

20:56.180 --> 20:57.780
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

20:58.540 --> 21:00.020
You're ace.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.850
Douglas?

21:18.900 --> 21:21.410
'You asked about Matthew Wild in 2003.'

21:21.460 --> 21:22.730
Yeah.

21:22.780 --> 21:25.330
- What did you find?
- In February 2003,

21:25.380 --> 21:29.810
his unit, the Royal Anglians, was in
Kuwait, getting ready for the big fuck-up.

21:29.860 --> 21:32.300
So he was nowhere near the UK?

21:33.820 --> 21:35.290
Wrong.

21:35.340 --> 21:39.850
His unit was in Kuwait. But he was in
London, working for the Ministry of Defence.

21:39.900 --> 21:41.170
Doing what?

21:41.220 --> 21:45.930
In charge of the MOD unit evaluating the
battlefield threat of Saddam's WMD programmes.

21:45.980 --> 21:49.010
He was the liaison
between the MOD and MI6.

21:49.060 --> 21:51.970
He would have seen all the
intel MI6 was developing.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.020
And the CIA.

21:56.020 --> 21:58.290
He was there, that night at the base.

21:58.340 --> 22:01.050
- He was the one with the expertise.
- 'Not necessarily.'

22:01.100 --> 22:04.730
'I know they were protecting someone.
This is who -- Matthew Wild.'

22:04.780 --> 22:07.810
You don't know that and you
certainly can't prove it.

22:07.860 --> 22:11.810
Yeah, I can't prove it, but there's some...
other stuff I know that makes it more than likely.

22:11.860 --> 22:14.650
God, how did you find this? This government
would never reveal this kind of thing.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.210
I spoke to a mate in the Anglians.

22:16.260 --> 22:18.170
He served with Wild in Iraq.

22:18.220 --> 22:20.210
Wild told him what he did before the war.

22:20.260 --> 22:23.090
He could have stayed in London
but he wanted to be with his unit.

22:23.140 --> 22:25.460
- Maybe he felt guilty.
- Why would he?

22:31.420 --> 22:33.410
- Emma?
- 'Yeah.'

22:33.460 --> 22:36.130
Wild was the one with the
expertise, wasn't he?

22:36.180 --> 22:39.330
Must have known the WMD story was
crap, but he kept his mouth shut

22:39.380 --> 22:41.170
in exchange for a
glittering political career.

22:41.220 --> 22:44.130
Funny thing about being a
soldier, you obey orders.

22:44.180 --> 22:47.050
My friend spoke highly of Wild,
said he was the real deal.

22:47.100 --> 22:49.770
So whatever happened at that
airbase, whoever was there,

22:49.820 --> 22:51.370
is he the man you want to be going after?

22:51.420 --> 22:54.330
Douglas, this isn't a bunch
of people having a chat.

22:54.380 --> 22:55.690
Someone died.

22:55.740 --> 22:58.250
I know you do a lot of good things, Emma.

22:58.300 --> 23:02.420
But this -- these people you're going
up against -- they're very dangerous.

23:03.460 --> 23:04.700
Yeah.

23:05.620 --> 23:07.340
'I'll be fine.'

24:25.820 --> 24:28.210
Aye, I know, it's been a long time.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.980
Hang on. I'll just get this.

24:31.620 --> 24:32.850
Emma, what's up?

24:32.900 --> 24:35.700
I think Greenwood was
right. I AM being followed.

24:36.220 --> 24:38.330
A van, two men in it, outside my house.

24:38.380 --> 24:40.090
And at the cemetery.

24:40.140 --> 24:42.170
Think the spooks are still after you?

24:42.220 --> 24:44.730
- I don't know.
- 'Is it outside your place now?'

24:44.780 --> 24:47.730
No, not now. But it was
there ten minutes ago.

24:47.780 --> 24:50.970
- 'Jesus, what's going on?'
- You should call Greenwood. Tell her.

24:51.020 --> 24:53.930
- No. - 'Em, if you're being
followed, call the cops.'

24:53.980 --> 24:56.610
No. Look... I'm just going nuts.

24:56.660 --> 24:58.660
I'm just imagining things.

24:59.220 --> 25:01.010
Kevin's dead.

25:01.060 --> 25:03.250
Whatever stones you've turned over...

25:03.300 --> 25:05.650
whatever's crawled out,
won't bring him back.

25:05.700 --> 25:08.810
'So putting your life in
danger is really not worth it.'

25:08.860 --> 25:10.860
Do you hear me?

25:12.020 --> 25:13.580
Yeah.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.300
'Thanks, Dom.'

25:48.300 --> 25:50.210
Oh, Jason!

26:19.160 --> 26:21.160
Dad told me about coming here.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.880
He said he liked your house.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.800
He said it was crazy.

26:31.960 --> 26:33.960
Is it really over?

26:35.480 --> 26:37.470
You said you were close.

26:37.520 --> 26:42.120
I am, but as a lawyer, I have to take
concrete evidence to the police, so they can...

26:43.120 --> 26:45.200
.. well, so they have to investigate.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.960
Why can't you get the evidence?

26:49.200 --> 26:52.400
Well, because to do that, I'd
have to get smart people...

26:54.240 --> 26:57.520
.. really smart people
to incriminate themselves.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.550
And they won't.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.600
So these smart people...

27:05.680 --> 27:08.200
.. you know who they are
but you can't get them?

27:12.920 --> 27:14.230
And that's it?

27:14.280 --> 27:16.280
You're giving up?

27:17.080 --> 27:19.590
Well, it's more complicated than that.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.390
What do you mean?

27:21.440 --> 27:22.920
I can't say.

27:28.960 --> 27:31.680
Um... does your mum know where you are?

27:33.520 --> 27:34.910
No.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.960
OK, well, it's too late to go home.

27:37.680 --> 27:40.080
So let's call her and
you can stay the night.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.440
I'll get you a sleeping bag.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.840
Why are you scared of them?

28:24.960 --> 28:26.960
'You're a warrior.'

28:27.920 --> 28:29.320
'Nathan...'

28:30.200 --> 28:32.200
'Never stop fighting. Never stop.'

28:42.200 --> 28:44.190
Hello, Zeinab, it's Emma.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.950
'It's a bit late, babes. What's up?'

28:46.000 --> 28:47.870
Do you have a number for Matthew Wild?

28:47.920 --> 28:49.710
'What left-wing do-gooder doesn't?'

28:49.760 --> 28:52.280
Even better, do you have
a number for his wife?

29:04.440 --> 29:07.310
- Banville just called.
- 'Did you speak with her?'

29:07.360 --> 29:11.550
I let it go to voicemail. But she
wants to meet with me tonight.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.510
What do I do, ignore it?

29:13.560 --> 29:15.030
Where are you?

29:15.080 --> 29:16.950
'London -- Matthew's house in Bermondsey.'

29:17.000 --> 29:21.710
- 'Where's he?'
- Out. A National Committee meeting.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.750
Call her.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.790
Say you'll meet tonight.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.950
No. No, I won't.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.240
Yes. Yes, you will.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.870
'I hoped she'd quit but she won't.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.920
Wait 30 minutes, then call her.'

29:40.440 --> 29:42.150
Understood. Bye.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.470
'Are you set?'

30:09.520 --> 30:10.710
Yeah.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.160
- 'You're clear to go.'
- What's the address?

31:32.720 --> 31:34.720
Target on site.

31:36.200 --> 31:38.200
Ms Banville.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.030
Come in.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.080
Thank you.

31:46.960 --> 31:49.110
She's inside. We a go?

31:49.160 --> 31:50.440
Yeah.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.800
I've got a story to tell...

32:08.840 --> 32:11.270
.. about a secret meeting
before the Iraq War.

32:11.320 --> 32:16.310
About falsified intelligence, about lies
that were told to Parliament, to the country.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.990
Mm... sounds... very exciting.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.910
And it's about the people
who were at this meeting,

32:21.960 --> 32:23.990
one of whom, I believe,

32:24.040 --> 32:26.030
was your husband.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.080
It doesn't sound very likely.

32:28.920 --> 32:30.910
Matthew was against the war...

32:30.960 --> 32:33.110
even when he was in the Army.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.870
Where was this meeting?

32:34.920 --> 32:36.910
Oh, an airbase in East Anglia,

32:36.960 --> 32:38.990
the night of 1st February, 2003.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.680
Do you recognise the date?

32:41.480 --> 32:43.480
No, it was before I met Matthew.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.630
So why are you telling
me this and not him?

32:46.680 --> 32:48.670
Well, that's the thing.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.800
I mean, no-one cares about this story.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.110
It's old. We all know
what happens in the end.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.230
We were deceived into fighting a war.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.310
Thousands of people died, it
was all a horrible mistake.

32:59.360 --> 33:02.440
So what difference does
one more detail make?

33:04.080 --> 33:06.080
You're probably right.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.190
But again... why are you telling me?

33:09.240 --> 33:11.480
Because I think if I
add you to the story...

33:12.680 --> 33:15.990
.. the beautiful wife of the
new Leader of the Opposition,

33:16.040 --> 33:18.040
I think people WILL care.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.720
What on earth are you talking about?

33:21.960 --> 33:23.960
You were on the base that night...

33:25.040 --> 33:26.750
.. Rachel...

33:26.800 --> 33:28.590
with your friend.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.040
What friend?

33:31.120 --> 33:32.430
Her.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.480
Linda Simms.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.520
We're set.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.990
There were two girls
on the base that night.

33:54.040 --> 33:56.040
One died, one got away.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.800
I never went near the base.

34:01.680 --> 34:04.880
Linda's uncle, Phil Simms,
swears he dropped you there.

34:20.520 --> 34:24.760
The only time I ever met Phil Simms
was about six weeks ago, with Matthew.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.389
I agreed to meet you because
Matthew and I admire your work.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.880
But in this case, you're so wide
of the mark, it's embarrassing.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.080
Now I want you to leave.

34:38.280 --> 34:43.360
Do you know the thing that I think the media
will find most intriguing, most entertaining?

34:44.520 --> 34:47.199
It's how Rachel Leigh,
ordinary schoolgirl...

34:48.280 --> 34:50.280
.. vanished for ten years.

34:51.280 --> 34:54.480
And then reappears...
bam!.. as Laura Wild.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.040
I mean, that's a story.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.680
That's front page.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.430
Girl goes abroad to learn a language.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.470
Girl comes home.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.510
Gets married.

35:06.560 --> 35:09.040
If you think that's a
story, well, good luck.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.600
Now I want you to leave.

35:17.960 --> 35:19.910
Linda nearly got clear.

35:19.960 --> 35:23.110
She had a chance of another life
and I'm sure she told you about it,

35:23.160 --> 35:25.870
about Logan, and that's
why you went to the base.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.510
- You wanted the same.
- Just go.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.550
And I understand why you did it.

35:30.600 --> 35:33.510
What else was there for a girl
like you in a place like that?

35:33.560 --> 35:36.270
You saw your opportunity
and you grabbed it.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.670
Get out!

35:37.720 --> 35:41.550
What I don't understand and what I
can't forgive you for is for Kevin.

35:41.600 --> 35:45.480
You knew he was innocent and you
dragged him in and you destroyed him.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.350
What's she doing here?

35:49.400 --> 35:52.510
Going on about Linda Simms,
making ridiculous accusations.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.560
What's wrong with you?

35:55.600 --> 35:58.480
Coming to my home, upsetting my wife?

36:02.880 --> 36:04.880
Just telling her my story.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.040
What story?

36:13.880 --> 36:15.880
Why don't you ask her?

36:20.960 --> 36:22.710
(Come away from the windows.)

36:22.760 --> 36:24.510
What? Why?

36:24.560 --> 36:26.230
Because she said so. Please.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.280
- She? Who?
- Heather.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.400
Oh, no.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.830
- No! How?
- The car.

36:35.880 --> 36:39.630
Banville's been threatened by one of her
terrorist clients. She had it coming.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.310
But here, outside our home?

36:41.360 --> 36:43.360
She's trying to destroy us.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.040
Her car!

36:54.240 --> 36:55.720
Stop!

36:56.920 --> 36:58.590
Don't do that.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.630
What are you talking about?

37:00.680 --> 37:03.560
You've been threatened.
People you represented.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.480
How do you know?

37:09.120 --> 37:10.360
I don't.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.800
But you do, don't you?

37:17.680 --> 37:19.680
Oh, my God.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.560
They'd kill me to protect you.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.520
Are you that important?

37:28.800 --> 37:30.270
You know what?

37:30.320 --> 37:31.390
Sod it.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.440
Emma, for Christ's sake!

37:36.040 --> 37:38.120
Are you scared for me or for yourself?

37:38.800 --> 37:40.310
I'm trying to help you.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.830
So you just tell me
what happened that night.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.670
Now, I know you were there,

37:44.720 --> 37:47.910
with Alastair McKinnon, with
Kretchmer, with the Iraqi.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.070
I know.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.120
Just tell me what happened.

37:54.720 --> 37:55.990
Don't!

37:56.040 --> 37:58.510
I'll stand down. I'll resign.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.550
Tell me what happened.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.720
I'm offering to give up my entire life.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.150
Well, Linda never had a life.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.630
Neither did Kevin.

38:06.680 --> 38:10.800
Now, you tell me what happened and I
will walk away, I will leave you alone.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.000
It was an accident!

38:14.280 --> 38:15.960
Tell me.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.840
There was a meeting.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.950
All the people you said.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.550
We were leaving.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.870
'Suddenly there was a girl,
she was coming towards us.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.190
She was smiling.'

38:46.240 --> 38:47.240
Stop!

38:49.840 --> 38:52.800
I said, stop right there!
Stop, or we will fire!

38:53.560 --> 38:56.150
'We weren't who she was
expecting. She panicked.'

38:56.200 --> 38:57.750
Get in the car quickly!

38:57.800 --> 38:59.640
'We got the principals out of there.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.560
We were clear.'

39:05.520 --> 39:09.390
There was no way she could recognise any
of us, not in the glare from the lights.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.440
So what happened?

39:15.600 --> 39:18.280
She ran out in front
of me. I couldn't stop.

39:24.080 --> 39:25.720
Well, then it was an accident.

39:26.760 --> 39:29.350
It was a bloody accident!
Why didn't you just say?

39:29.400 --> 39:32.600
It was the wrong time, the wrong
people. If it had come out...

39:34.880 --> 39:36.350
It was a secret meeting.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.120
'The Iraqi scientist...

39:39.360 --> 39:41.040
.. his lies.'

39:45.880 --> 39:47.590
Everyone's lies.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.990
And your wife? How was she involved?

39:53.080 --> 39:54.560
'She was there.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.080
She saw everything.'

40:01.200 --> 40:03.000
'So she lied too?'

40:03.760 --> 40:05.270
God, you people!

40:05.320 --> 40:08.270
You just think you can
change reality, don't you?

40:08.320 --> 40:12.190
I was never one of those people! I have
been making up for this ever since!

40:12.240 --> 40:13.990
And I will go on making up for it!

40:14.040 --> 40:16.990
So you should just go free because
you've got good intentions?

40:17.040 --> 40:18.510
Well, Kevin's dead.

40:18.560 --> 40:23.110
And Kevin spent 14 years
in prison for your crime!

40:23.160 --> 40:25.160
For YOUR crime!

40:26.160 --> 40:27.560
It was an accident.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.760
Should there be no accountability?

40:32.880 --> 40:34.870
You said you'd walk away.

40:34.920 --> 40:36.560
Please.

40:44.600 --> 40:45.800
Jesus!

40:46.880 --> 40:48.390
I lied.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.550
You got everything?

41:11.600 --> 41:13.600
Yeah, we got it all.

41:14.440 --> 41:16.440
Could you give us a moment, please?

41:23.840 --> 41:26.110
Glad you got your job back.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.150
I'm glad you called.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.790
Well done.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.840
That was quite the catch.

41:33.480 --> 41:35.070
A little bit late.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.630
For Kevin, yes.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.240
I'm sorry.

41:39.640 --> 41:41.350
Not just for Kevin.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.880
For everyone.

41:44.680 --> 41:46.430
So you'll do what you promised?

41:46.480 --> 41:48.030
I'll try.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.070
No, you'll succeed.

41:50.120 --> 41:53.390
Miriam Attar released, all
charges against her dropped.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.840
Don't let another innocent person suffer.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.040
OK.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.200
You need to come with me.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.430
I have diplomatic immunity.

42:25.480 --> 42:26.760
No, you don't.

42:36.840 --> 42:38.680
Hello, little man.

42:54.560 --> 42:56.200
Thank you, Emma.

42:59.240 --> 43:00.760
You did good.

43:11.640 --> 43:13.520
'I'm here.

43:14.520 --> 43:16.160
I'll catch you.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.280
Come on.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.720
Trust me.'

43:31.560 --> 43:33.560
Why did you believe he didn't do it?

43:35.320 --> 43:37.840
It was more that I didn't
trust the other side.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.150
At first, anyway.

43:41.200 --> 43:43.520
Then I got to know him,
then I believed him.

43:45.160 --> 43:47.160
Why didn't you trust the other side?

43:48.360 --> 43:51.480
Oh, I learnt a long time ago not
to trust what people tell me.

43:52.440 --> 43:54.760
- Especially from people
in authority. - Why?

43:56.040 --> 43:58.160
Because you never know their reasons.

44:02.680 --> 44:06.480
When I was young, I was shown a piece
of evidence by people I trusted.

44:07.680 --> 44:09.920
- What was it?
- A photo.

44:11.320 --> 44:14.640
A photo that seemed to show that
the man I was in love with...

44:15.680 --> 44:17.670
.. was a liar and a cheat.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.710
What was in the photo?

44:19.760 --> 44:23.880
Him and another woman, with the
same last name, holding a baby.

44:25.200 --> 44:30.310
So of course I thought it was his wife and his
child because that's how it had been presented.

44:30.360 --> 44:31.800
But it wasn't.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.750
It was his sister?

44:35.800 --> 44:38.000
Yeah, it was his sister and HER child...

44:39.160 --> 44:41.160
.. which I learned four years later.

44:43.120 --> 44:45.120
Four years too late.

44:46.320 --> 44:48.120
So I lost him.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.600
And I lost a whole lot more than that.

44:54.720 --> 44:56.720
And it changed my life.

44:59.240 --> 45:01.240
And it broke my heart.

45:03.560 --> 45:05.550
I misread the evidence.

45:05.600 --> 45:07.800
I was too angry and upset to question it.

45:08.480 --> 45:09.950
But question.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
That's the point.

45:13.480 --> 45:15.480
Always question.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Your mum's here.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.560
Make him proud.
