MONARCH:
You're probably
asking yourself --

00:07.507 --> 00:08.839
how did it all
come to this?

00:08.908 --> 00:10.342
How did I get here
when there were

00:10.410 --> 00:14.177
so many paths
I could have chosen?

00:14.247 --> 00:16.842
Great!
I need this now, too?

00:16.916 --> 00:20.978
[ Monarch laughing ]

00:23.590 --> 00:26.116
Yet another dead end,
Venture!

00:26.192 --> 00:27.751
Aah!

00:27.827 --> 00:29.625
And as you look back
on your pathetic life,

00:29.696 --> 00:31.665
you'll see that it was
all just one long,

00:31.731 --> 00:35.463
winding, inevitable road
to this very moment...

00:35.802 --> 00:38.294
Aaaahhh!

00:38.371 --> 00:40.772
But I won't let you off
that easily, Venture.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.366
You will have your
date with death,

00:43.443 --> 00:45.639
but she's gonna have
to sit this one out...

00:45.712 --> 00:48.181
for the Monarch

[laughing ]

00:50.884 --> 00:53.513
Dance!
Dance, little man!

00:53.586 --> 00:56.112
How does it feel to be
a helpless puppet of fate?

00:56.189 --> 00:58.021
Oh, sorry.

00:58.091 --> 00:59.821
We're gonna have to pick it up
here another time.

00:59.893 --> 01:00.952
What?

01:01.027 --> 01:02.757
It's Wednesday night.
I have my therapy.

01:02.829 --> 01:04.024
What the hell is
he talking about?

01:04.096 --> 01:06.259
Uh, new Guild
clemency clause.

01:06.332 --> 01:07.994
Mental health
arch exclusion.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.230
Let me see that.

01:10.303 --> 01:11.965
Oh, damn it to -- A ha!

01:12.038 --> 01:14.269
It says here you're excused
only if you have

01:14.340 --> 01:16.275
a note from your doctor.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.038
Got one right here.

01:18.111 --> 01:20.239
It's, uh,
it's in my pocket.

01:26.619 --> 01:28.781
Well, Venture, if I can't
murder you today,

01:28.855 --> 01:30.687
at least it would appear
I have finally succeeded

01:30.757 --> 01:32.555
in driving you insane!

01:32.625 --> 01:34.821
That's not necessarily true.

01:34.894 --> 01:37.227
People see therapists
for all kinds of reasons.

01:37.297 --> 01:40.927
Man, when my wife left me,
I went through a pretty bad--

01:41.000 --> 01:42.468
[sighs ]

01:42.535 --> 01:44.470
Okay, henchmen!
That's a wrap!

01:44.537 --> 01:46.938
Abort mayhem,
and fall in!

01:47.006 --> 01:49.305
Hey, hey hey!
What's with the bitching?

01:49.375 --> 01:51.173
You don't
want a night off?

01:51.244 --> 01:53.145
You got lucky
this time, old man.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.910
Oh, in your dreams,
fat back!

01:59.219 --> 02:00.585
So...I don't know.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.679
Sometimes I wish I could
just be a normal kid,

02:02.755 --> 02:05.589
and go out and play with kids
my own age and stuff.

02:05.658 --> 02:08.252
The only people I get to hang
out with are grown-ups.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.354
The only time I get
to leave the compound

02:10.430 --> 02:13.662
is to go someplace creepy,
like the Bermuda Triangle.

02:13.733 --> 02:15.395
And then I get kidnapped.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.993
By grown-ups.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.902
And I'm not even sure I wanna
be a super scientist

02:18.972 --> 02:20.770
when I grow up anyway.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.173
But I feel all this pressure
because of my fa--

02:23.243 --> 02:25.269
it feels weird telling you
all this stuff.

02:25.345 --> 02:26.938
Remember, Rusty --

02:27.013 --> 02:30.006
in here, I'm your doctor,
not your father.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.779
Now let's get back
to it, shall we?

02:31.851 --> 02:33.843
You were telling me
how you're ungrateful for all

02:33.920 --> 02:35.513
the opportunities your father
has given you,

02:35.588 --> 02:37.454
and you blame me
for all your problems.

02:37.524 --> 02:38.890
[sighs ]

02:38.958 --> 02:40.950
So, you can see why
I've been reluctant

02:41.027 --> 02:43.360
to go back into therapy.

02:43.429 --> 02:46.365
Well, I hope you'll find this
a much healthier environment

02:46.432 --> 02:48.663
in which to begin
a new adventure...

02:48.735 --> 02:50.260
of healing.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.237
Because you're not in it alone
anymore.

02:52.305 --> 02:55.207
Everyone, let's all welcome
Rusty to our little group.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.107
ALL:
Hi, Rusty!

02:57.177 --> 02:59.976
Everyone here can relate to what
you're going through, Rusty.

03:00.046 --> 03:03.483
As boy adventurers,
they've been there, too.

03:03.550 --> 03:06.486
So, I think maybe a good way
for us to get started tonight

03:06.553 --> 03:08.749
is if we just quickly go
around the room,

03:08.821 --> 03:11.381
and each of you tells Rusty
a little about yourself

03:11.457 --> 03:13.551
and your journey
to the group.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.356
Me first?

03:15.428 --> 03:18.364
Well, I have a bit
of an eating disorder.

03:18.431 --> 03:19.330
Nooo.

03:19.399 --> 03:20.731
Lance, wait your turn.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.632
As a superhero sidekick,

03:22.702 --> 03:24.898
I led a very active,
athletic lifestyle.

03:24.971 --> 03:28.135
But when I turned 18,
and I was,

03:28.208 --> 03:30.643
shall we say,
replaced with a newer model,

03:30.710 --> 03:34.511
uh, I started putting
the weight on.

03:34.581 --> 03:38.746
Then I'd eat more
because I was depressed.

03:38.818 --> 03:40.753
And...

03:40.820 --> 03:44.279
I have abandonment issues?

03:44.357 --> 03:45.256
More?

03:45.325 --> 03:46.452
Tell Rusty your name.

03:46.526 --> 03:48.085
Oh, well, that's
a tricky one.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.289
Uh, yeah, the latest drama
in my caped crusade

03:50.363 --> 03:52.389
against
Captain Sunshine's lawyers

03:52.465 --> 03:55.025
is I get to keep
most of the costume,

03:55.101 --> 03:57.661
but I'm no longer allowed
to call myself Wonder Boy

- My turn?

Hale brothers.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.947
Boy detectives?
You've heard of us.

04:07.013 --> 04:09.448
I'm here because my allegedly
twin brother Dale

04:09.515 --> 04:11.882
is still having trouble getting
over our father's death.

04:11.951 --> 04:13.613
Still...

04:13.686 --> 04:14.517
I can still see his face
through the soft focus

04:14.587 --> 04:16.180
of the steam
from his pooling blood

04:16.255 --> 04:18.088
as he lay sputtering
on the cold linoleum.

04:18.156 --> 04:19.921
Punch buggy depressing!

04:19.993 --> 04:21.894
Nobody wants to hear
that crap, Dale.

04:21.961 --> 04:23.554

Sorry.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.622
We didn't just lose
our dad that night.

04:25.698 --> 04:29.066
His murder remains
our only unsolved case ever.

04:29.135 --> 04:30.933
We had to quit the business
because the shame was just --

04:31.004 --> 04:32.700
Pfft!
Yeah.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.900
Retiring at 30
on Daddy's famous fortune

04:34.974 --> 04:36.408

real hard on you.

For your information,

local boy detective academy.

04:41.147 --> 04:42.479
We hardly got dick

04:42.548 --> 04:44.540
because nothing we did was ever
good enough for him!

04:44.617 --> 04:46.711
He did leave us
that nice car.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.277
It's totally fucking cherry!

04:48.354 --> 04:49.219
But that is
not the point, Dale.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.155
And don't interrupt me again or
I'll swear I'll so fucking sock you.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.922
Uh, Johnny, how about you tell
Rusty why you're here.

04:54.994 --> 04:57.054
Ah, Rusty knows me from
way back, so we can skip --

04:57.130 --> 04:58.860
just go to Ro-Boy.

04:58.931 --> 05:00.194
Hi, hi, Doctor Venture.

05:00.266 --> 05:01.928
My name is Ro-Boy--

05:02.001 --> 05:04.334
But I just wanna point out
I'm only here

05:04.404 --> 05:06.430
'cause Action Johnny
had himself

05:06.506 --> 05:08.805
a little run-in
with Johnny Law

05:08.875 --> 05:12.004
and was ordered to attend
by Johnny Judge.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.671
Not my fault.
Somebody else's.

05:13.746 --> 05:14.907
Interesting.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.382
Group, do you see how Johnny
views his whole world

05:17.450 --> 05:19.476
as some sort of cabal
of Johnnies who

05:19.552 --> 05:22.112
are conspiring
to undermine him?

05:22.188 --> 05:24.054
That's what we call
paranoid projection,

05:24.123 --> 05:26.615
and it's a classic expression
of narcissistic rage.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.218
It's a figure of speech,
dude.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.525
And the judge's name
was actually John.

05:30.596 --> 05:32.087
It's, like, the most common
name in the world.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.690
Wrong! That would be Muhammed.
Googled it.

05:33.766 --> 05:37.533

during share time.

Beep boop.

05:46.045 --> 05:47.479
What was that?

05:47.547 --> 05:49.709
I... just turned off the radio
in my utility belt,

05:49.782 --> 05:50.647
like he said to.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.709
You said "beep boop."
With your mouth.

05:52.785 --> 05:55.220
No, I didn't.
Leave me alone.

05:55.288 --> 05:58.019
Boys, this is really
something we can get into

to make you sit through

Ugh, that Kid Rock one

empty row right there.

Let's just
move up one.

for my kinetosis.

during the battles.

06:19.278 --> 06:21.304
Awful lot of kids here, huh?

You're never too young
for enchantment.

06:30.256 --> 06:34.352

a pharmacological candy store,

06:34.427 --> 06:36.419
so I started real young.

06:36.496 --> 06:39.398
Next thing I know, I'm blowing
lines of voodoo powder

06:39.465 --> 06:42.765
off the back of a monkey's paw
I bought in Calcutta.

06:42.835 --> 06:45.031
Now I'm all out of wishes.

to wear long pants

06:46.806 --> 06:48.365
until I left for college.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.000
Is it any wonder I didn't
lose my virginity

06:50.076 --> 06:51.669
until I was over 20?

06:51.744 --> 06:54.145
So dumbass here is
so freaked out by the mess,

of detective training

06:57.250 --> 06:58.741

picks up the shotgun

06:58.818 --> 07:00.252
with his bare hands.

07:00.319 --> 07:02.254
Well, I just instinctively
reached out

07:02.321 --> 07:03.812
to stop him, of course.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.756
And so, that's how
both our sets of prints

07:05.825 --> 07:07.623
ended up on the murder weapon.

07:07.693 --> 07:08.752
I tried to be good.

I just can't
help myself sometimes.

When I see a giant robot
I just get so mad,

07:13.399 --> 07:15.129
I wanna beat them up!

07:15.201 --> 07:17.170
And then I wanna
burn them!

07:17.236 --> 07:20.638
Sometimes I wanna
burn the whole world!

get an erection now

don't have a gender.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.947
I'm an angry native.
Booga booga!

08:37.015 --> 08:38.416
What are you gonna do!

08:38.484 --> 08:40.350
- Uh, shoot him?
- You don't have a gun.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.251
Uh, get a grown-up
to shoot him?

08:42.321 --> 08:44.017
You're all alone
in this jungle.

08:44.090 --> 08:44.989
Er? Run and hide?

08:45.057 --> 08:46.821
No more running!
No more hiding.

08:46.893 --> 08:48.691
Confront your problem
head on!

08:48.761 --> 08:51.094
Okay, uh.

08:54.600 --> 08:55.966
How about just
talking to him.

08:56.035 --> 08:56.866
T-Talking?

08:56.936 --> 09:00.236
Yes, he's an angry native
but he's also a person.

09:00.306 --> 09:01.638
Start a dialogue.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.437
Uh, okay.
Um...

09:03.509 --> 09:05.341
[ clears throat ]

09:05.411 --> 09:08.381
Why you guys always chase me
with spears?

09:08.447 --> 09:10.348
You parked your giant
iron Thunderbird

09:10.416 --> 09:11.816
on my ancestors'
burial ground.

09:11.884 --> 09:12.817
I did?

09:12.885 --> 09:14.649
I'm afraid you're
a trickster God

09:14.720 --> 09:17.053
who will woo my women away and
fly them to your sky hut.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.524
Well, I...
I did not know that.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.493
I'm... sorry?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.087
I accept your apology.
Now hug me.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.325
I don't -- I don't --

09:26.399 --> 09:28.265
O--Okay.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.064
There.
See how easy that was?

09:30.136 --> 09:32.696
We all have our own
inner angry natives.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.764
And our minds
invent a million ways

09:34.840 --> 09:36.741
to avoid confronting them
directly.

09:36.809 --> 09:38.573
But if you just
look them in the eye

09:38.644 --> 09:41.011
and ask them why they're
chasing you with spears,

09:41.080 --> 09:43.072
you just might
learn something...

09:43.149 --> 09:44.674
about yourself.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.581
Question?

09:45.651 --> 09:46.812
Uh, yeah.

09:46.886 --> 09:48.081
In my line of boy adventuring,

09:48.154 --> 09:50.521
I didn't really deal
with angry natives, so...

09:50.590 --> 09:52.388
Yeah, us neither.

09:52.458 --> 09:55.690
Then call them whatever works
for your specific genre's idiom.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.957
Inner international jewel thief,
for instance.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.259
Inner supervillain.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.425
Inner jelly doughnut...

10:00.499 --> 10:02.092
Inner giant robot works.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.297
Johnny, you can stop
hugging the native now.

10:05.371 --> 10:06.202

10:06.272 --> 10:08.503
Come on, guys.

10:08.574 --> 10:10.440
By the way,
you never bothered

10:10.509 --> 10:12.068
to ask the little
fella his name.

10:12.144 --> 10:13.612
Oh! Um...

10:13.679 --> 10:15.944
Eh, what's--
what's your name?

10:16.015 --> 10:17.449
Chemical Dependence.

Okay, um, Dr. Venture,
it's your turn.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.088
All right, but uh,
just do me a favor

10:26.158 --> 10:27.888
and whisper
your name to me

10:27.960 --> 10:29.189

to that part, okay?

10:29.261 --> 10:31.696
Ow!
Charlie horse.

10:31.764 --> 10:32.595
Okay, so...

Premature Ejaculation?

10:52.785 --> 10:56.017
Holy vanishing vitals!
He's dead!

10:56.088 --> 10:57.954
Oh, man! Oh, man!

10:58.024 --> 10:59.492
Too heavy.
This is too heavy!

10:59.558 --> 11:01.288
Get out of there, Dale.
What are you trying to do?

11:01.360 --> 11:03.693
Detective work, Lance.
Remember that?

11:03.763 --> 11:05.595
Rusty, smell the tea.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.031
Poison?

11:07.099 --> 11:08.192
Chamomile.

Doesn't he have one of these?

Holy rigormortis.

no such snake.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.835
Sergeant Hatred?

17:17.903 --> 17:18.801
Come on, open up.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.839
We want to help you!

17:20.906 --> 17:24.775
Now, boys, I locked myself
in here for your safety.

17:24.843 --> 17:26.367
I'm gonna be okay.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.310
I know what I have to do now.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.906
So just back away
from the door,

17:30.983 --> 17:33.714
and go hide someplace
I can't see you.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.722
Uncle Hatred's gonna calmly exit
the panic room

17:36.789 --> 17:38.690
and head straight
for the hangar.

17:38.757 --> 17:40.658
What's in the hangar?
More medicine?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.524
We can get it for you.

17:42.594 --> 17:45.393
No, I'm taking the X-1
and I'm going to Thailand!

17:45.464 --> 17:49.367
Just for a little while,
just so I can buy

17:49.435 --> 17:52.803
a beautiful brown
little boy/girl

17:52.871 --> 17:55.238
to keep in my room
for when the urges come!

17:55.307 --> 17:56.639
You can't do that!

17:56.708 --> 17:58.006
Sure, I can!

17:58.077 --> 18:00.171
Gary Glitter told me
where to get one.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.577
And Dean?

18:01.647 --> 18:03.479
Dean, wouldn't you
like to have

18:03.549 --> 18:05.745
a beautiful brown little
brother/sister?

18:05.818 --> 18:08.947
No! And beautiful boy-girls
aren't the answer!

18:09.021 --> 18:11.183
You have to fight
the bad urges.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.420
I can't!
Not without my meds!

18:14.493 --> 18:17.088
Yes, you can!
I know you can.

18:17.162 --> 18:18.528
Just do whatever
you used to do

18:18.597 --> 18:19.758
before they gave you
the medicine.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.596
Princess Tinyfeet!

18:21.667 --> 18:23.636
She's what I used to do.

18:23.702 --> 18:25.796
She was the only thing

18:25.871 --> 18:28.602
that ever got me over
my dirty little weakness.

18:28.674 --> 18:32.202
But she won't
return my calls!

18:32.277 --> 18:34.644
Mmm.

18:34.713 --> 18:36.409
Thanks, Mrs. Z.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.417
Wow, this one really
loves my cooking.

18:38.484 --> 18:39.918
I like him.

18:39.985 --> 18:41.681
Oh, thirds? Really?
That's a good idea.

18:41.753 --> 18:44.416
You don't see a connection
between this...

18:44.490 --> 18:45.856
and this!

18:45.924 --> 18:47.916
I can't help it.
It's compulsive.

18:47.993 --> 18:50.258
I was seeing
someone about it.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.560
[ chuckles ]
Isn't she a treasure?

18:52.631 --> 18:55.601
Would you believe Mrs. Z is
actually older than I?

18:55.667 --> 18:57.192
Hey, just like me and Rust.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.363
I'm the older one, but he looks
like he could be my dad.

18:59.438 --> 19:00.872
That's because you've got

19:00.939 --> 19:02.874
more chemical preservatives
in you than a twinkie.

19:02.941 --> 19:04.933
And don't try to tell me
that isn't a weave.

19:05.010 --> 19:08.037
So, a snake kills
your psychiatrist,

19:08.113 --> 19:10.378
and you fly
all the way down here

19:10.449 --> 19:11.883
in the middle of the night

19:11.950 --> 19:14.385
to beat up an old man
because of a matchbook?

19:14.453 --> 19:16.615
Yeah, sounds kind of sloppy
when you say it.

19:16.688 --> 19:18.748
When are you boys
going to grow up?

19:18.824 --> 19:21.453
Didn't you get enough of this
nonsense when you were kids?

19:21.527 --> 19:23.621
We had to do something.
It was a mystery.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.561
There's always a mystery.

19:25.631 --> 19:27.190
It never ends.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.565
Not until you decide
when enough is enough.

19:29.635 --> 19:32.503
You mean just
give it all up?

19:32.571 --> 19:33.971
Yes!
Why not?

19:34.039 --> 19:36.065
Leave it to the next
10-year-old boy

19:36.141 --> 19:38.042
with a jetpack
and a spyglass.

19:38.110 --> 19:42.070
Take it from an old man --
there is more to life.

19:42.147 --> 19:44.981
I am much happier now that I
settled down with Mrs. Z

19:45.050 --> 19:48.145
than I ever was chasing Johnny
around with a laser.

19:48.220 --> 19:51.247
I only regret that it took so
long for me to figure it out.

19:51.323 --> 19:54.259
We never had children
of our own, you see.

19:54.326 --> 19:55.885
We married late.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.623
And though my lover's mountains

19:57.696 --> 19:59.460
are both beautiful
and bountiful,

19:59.531 --> 20:02.433
I'm afraid the valley below
is quite barren.

20:02.501 --> 20:05.164
I thought we could not have kids
because I was your beard.

20:05.237 --> 20:06.535
[ chuckles ]

20:06.605 --> 20:10.440
Dr. Z, Mrs. Z, would you like
to adopt me?

20:10.509 --> 20:12.740
ALL:
Aww, that's sweet.

20:12.811 --> 20:14.040
Dr. Z is right.

20:14.112 --> 20:15.580
You know, I should
thank you guys.

20:15.647 --> 20:17.878
You all made me realize
something important tonight.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.145
I'm not alone.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.743
Band of brothers, man.

20:20.819 --> 20:22.310
No, I mean...

20:22.387 --> 20:24.356
What the hell am I doing
in therapy in the first place?

20:24.423 --> 20:25.948
I'm no drug addict.

20:26.024 --> 20:27.515
I don't have
an eating disorder.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.425
And as much
as I resented my father,

20:29.494 --> 20:30.792
I never wanted to kill him.

20:30.862 --> 20:32.524
Whoa, that was
never proven.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.829
And most importantly,
I grew up.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.869
I'm not a boy adventurer.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.131
I have my own business,
and my own family.

20:39.204 --> 20:40.502
And if you'll excuse me,

20:40.572 --> 20:43.508
I think it's high time
I got back to them.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.043
[door opens, closes ]

20:45.110 --> 20:46.408
[ Hatred crying ]

20:46.478 --> 20:47.946
Sergeant Hatred?

20:48.013 --> 20:50.505
There's someone here
who wants to talk to you.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.557
Nibblet?
Honey!

20:58.624 --> 20:59.489
Now!

20:59.558 --> 21:01.891
[screaming ]

21:01.960 --> 21:03.826
[ Hank crows ]
B team --

21:03.895 --> 21:05.727
hit him!

21:05.797 --> 21:07.459
Princess!

21:07.532 --> 21:09.763
Whyyy!

21:09.835 --> 21:12.202
[groans ]

21:12.271 --> 21:13.933
Thanks, dude.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.668
No, thank you.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.232
I so owed him one.

21:45.537 --> 21:48.507
Out of nowhere, there's this big
glowing viking longboat

21:48.573 --> 21:50.269
and it comes out
of the clouds.

21:50.342 --> 21:53.540
And everybody who ever died
in all these films is on it,

21:53.612 --> 21:54.978
and then it carries him --

21:55.047 --> 21:56.948
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, boss!

21:57.015 --> 21:59.109
Just you in here?
Thought I heard you talking.

21:59.184 --> 22:02.120
I was pod blogging...
casting... diary.

22:02.187 --> 22:04.019
Oh, so how was it?

22:04.089 --> 22:05.421
Better than the first one.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.119
I like the second one
a little better.

22:08.193 --> 22:10.287
Yeah, that's what they were
saying on "Ain't It Cool."

22:10.362 --> 22:12.888
Yeah, all in all, a fitting end
to the trilogy, though.

22:12.964 --> 22:14.330
Cool.

22:14.399 --> 22:17.062
Okay, well, uh,
good night then.

22:17.135 --> 22:18.501
Good night, boss.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.801
Oh, did you, uh, remember to
take care of that thing?

22:20.872 --> 22:22.397
Yeah, yeah totally.

22:22.474 --> 22:24.067
Office was on the way
to the theater.

22:24.142 --> 22:25.667
So we slipped the snake
right through the air vent.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.736
He's gotta be
dead by now.

22:27.813 --> 22:30.146
Then Venture's got
no more excuses!

22:30.215 --> 22:31.308
Excellent!

22:31.383 --> 22:33.909
Reload the scarionette cannon!

22:33.985 --> 22:37.114
Tomorrow, we arch anew!
