00:43.127 --> 00:47.086
Who will groan first when they
see it, Granny or Papa?

00:47.087 --> 00:51.647
I should think they'll
howl at the moon in unison.

01:03.927 --> 01:06.127
What in God's name is this?

01:09.327 --> 01:12.766
Well I never!
Where did this come from?

01:12.767 --> 01:16.806
I ordered it in London,
picked it up on the way back.

01:16.807 --> 01:19.126
It's an AC.
Well, at least it's English.

01:19.127 --> 01:21.086
Welcome back, my darling.

01:21.087 --> 01:25.886
How was the honeymoon? My eyes
have been opened. Don't I know it!

01:25.887 --> 01:27.967
Anna get back all right? Yes.

01:31.527 --> 01:34.846
Who's that for? Why are you
doing it down here?

01:34.847 --> 01:38.206
It's for Mr Matthew.
It was creased, I'm ironing it.

01:38.207 --> 01:42.046
You're never looking after him?
What about Mr Molesley?

01:42.047 --> 01:45.526
He's staying at Crawley House.
Why wasn't I asked?

01:45.527 --> 01:49.767
Mr Carson thought it best. Did he?
I wonder how that came about?

01:50.247 --> 01:54.006
If you're learning your job,
never open a shirt in a room

01:54.007 --> 01:57.966
where it might be marked,
let alone put studs in it.

01:57.967 --> 02:01.806
Do that in a dressing room
and nowhere else. Thank you.

02:01.807 --> 02:05.487
Yes, you're always trying to be
so very helpful.

02:08.727 --> 02:12.566
How did you enjoy the south
of France? It was lovely,

02:12.567 --> 02:14.606
but almost too hot, even now.

02:14.607 --> 02:19.166
It's a shame they close things
in the summer. I love the sun.

02:19.167 --> 02:23.686
So we can see. You couldn't be in
Cannes in summer, it's unbearable.

02:23.687 --> 02:26.966
I could. Just how long
is she here for?

02:26.967 --> 02:29.846
Who knows? No guest
should be admitted

02:29.847 --> 02:32.566
with no departure date settled.

02:32.567 --> 02:34.766
You won't get any argument from me.

02:34.767 --> 02:38.806
There's a hideous pile of post.
I've put it on the hall table.

02:38.807 --> 02:41.846
Don't look at it tonight.
What have you been up to?

02:41.847 --> 02:45.166
I've found myself a new occupation,

02:45.167 --> 02:47.726
but Violet
doesn't think it's appropriate.

02:47.727 --> 02:49.846
Can we talk about it afterwards?

02:49.847 --> 02:54.887
Are there still forbidden subjects
in 1920? I can't believe this.

02:56.047 --> 02:58.286
I speak of taste rather than law.

02:58.287 --> 03:00.927
Well, it's not my taste.

03:01.407 --> 03:04.366
What about you, Cora?
I agree with Mama.

03:04.367 --> 03:07.806
Some subjects are not suitable
for every ear.

03:07.807 --> 03:11.006
Oh, pas devant les domestiques.

03:11.007 --> 03:13.646
Come on, my dear, Carson and Alfred

03:13.647 --> 03:16.407
know more about life
than we ever will.

03:17.807 --> 03:22.127
Can't we stop this? How?
She's like a runaway train.

03:23.927 --> 03:26.126
Shall we go through?

03:26.127 --> 03:29.526
What about poor old Strallan?
Have you seen him?

03:29.527 --> 03:33.167
Why do you call him
poor or old? He's neither.

03:34.367 --> 03:38.446
Isn't it dangerous to let
this Strallan nonsense simmer on?

03:38.447 --> 03:42.686
To be fair, I don't think it's
coming from him. Ask him to end it.

03:42.687 --> 03:45.607
He'll be more effective
than if we try.

03:47.847 --> 03:49.806
Ooh, she ate it, then?

03:49.807 --> 03:52.086
Never sure about Americans and offal.

03:52.087 --> 03:55.566
She'll eat whatever you
put in front of her. What a gob.

03:55.567 --> 03:58.326
Mr Carson was going to put a bag
over her head.

03:58.327 --> 04:01.806
Oops. Mrs Levinson
knows you make fun of her

04:01.807 --> 04:06.606
because she makes fun of you.
We're all square, then.

04:06.607 --> 04:09.646
It's not drying properly,
the oven's not hot enough.

04:09.647 --> 04:12.167
A bad workman
always blames his tools.

04:12.927 --> 04:17.486
Are you busy? No. We're eating
in half an hour but it's all done.

04:17.487 --> 04:19.567
Well, if you could spare a minute.

04:21.887 --> 04:26.486
This is very good, you didn't open
it for me. Certainly I did.

04:26.487 --> 04:28.967
To welcome you into this house
as my son.

04:29.367 --> 04:31.847
I can't tell you
how glad it makes me.

04:34.807 --> 04:39.246
I want us always to feel we can be
honest with each other.

04:39.247 --> 04:44.967
Of course. Because Mary's told me
about your present difficulties.

04:46.807 --> 04:49.086
Oh, she was right,

04:49.087 --> 04:52.927
losing Downton will affect you both
more than anyone.

04:54.607 --> 04:58.567
Has she told you about
the will of Lavinia's father?

04:58.847 --> 05:02.126
Yes, your father told me
all about it,

05:02.127 --> 05:07.086
but I cannot understand why so
much money was put into one company.

05:07.087 --> 05:11.406
I couldn't agree more. Now we're
to be turned out of Downton.

05:11.407 --> 05:14.646
Even Lloyd George can't want that.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.807
I'm not sure he's a good example.

05:17.487 --> 05:20.726
The point is have we overlooked
something,

05:20.727 --> 05:25.007
some source of revenue
previously untapped?

05:26.727 --> 05:31.086
If only we had some coal,
or gravel, or tin.

05:31.087 --> 05:34.766
I can think of someone
who's got plenty of tin.

05:34.767 --> 05:38.206
So you help women who have...
fallen over?

05:38.207 --> 05:42.766
Not quite. Isabelle helps women who
have to degrade themselves

05:42.767 --> 05:45.446
to survive.
There's a centre in York.

05:45.447 --> 05:48.606
No addresses, please.
Alfred will make notes.

05:48.607 --> 05:54.326
What do you do for these women?
First, we like to send them away...

05:54.327 --> 05:57.326
to rest. I should think
they need it.

05:57.327 --> 06:01.286
And then we try to find them
alternative employment.

06:01.287 --> 06:05.486
The War destroyed many households,
thousands of bread winners died.

06:05.487 --> 06:07.927
So you want me to contribute?

06:08.607 --> 06:12.686
You don't have to give money
after every conversation. No?

06:12.687 --> 06:16.567
Isn't that what the English expect
of rich Americans?

06:18.527 --> 06:22.566
Why can't you benefit from the will?
You've done nothing wrong.

06:22.567 --> 06:26.006
He didn't know I'd broken
his daughter's heart.

06:26.007 --> 06:28.246
It was to reward my fidelity

06:28.247 --> 06:30.286
when in fact I'd betrayed her.

06:30.287 --> 06:34.527
If I kept that money, I'd be
no better than a common criminal.

06:35.367 --> 06:37.166
I see.

06:37.167 --> 06:40.607
If that's how you feel,
there's no more to be said.

06:42.167 --> 06:45.926
I'm ever so sorry, my lord,
I thought you were out of here.

06:45.927 --> 06:48.047
We should be. Please.
We're going now.

06:53.327 --> 06:57.167
It's a lump, there's no point
dithering about that.

06:58.207 --> 07:01.646
What are you going to do about it?
I don't know.

07:01.647 --> 07:07.446
Tomorrow, you'll make an appointment
with the doctor and see what he says.

07:07.447 --> 07:12.686
But what if it's...
If it is, and I'm not saying it is,

07:12.687 --> 07:14.487
it's best to know now.

07:16.007 --> 07:18.006
I suppose so.

07:18.007 --> 07:23.807
Now, look, you'll not be alone for
a minute if you don't want to be,

07:24.607 --> 07:27.247
but we have to get it seen to.

07:28.327 --> 07:30.367
Then there's expense.

07:31.447 --> 07:35.567
If you must pay money, better
to a doctor than an undertaker.

07:38.807 --> 07:42.686
If that's an example of your bedside
manner, Mrs Patmore,

07:42.687 --> 07:45.207
I think I'd sooner face it alone.

07:50.567 --> 07:54.166
It seems shocking for Anna
to find me en deshabille.

07:54.167 --> 07:58.207
I'm made of stout stuff, sir,
don't worry about that.

08:02.207 --> 08:05.926
Are you seeing Bates today?
I am, and I can't wait.

08:05.927 --> 08:08.047
Give him our best wishes.

08:08.487 --> 08:11.607
It still seems odd
to be found in your bed.

08:12.847 --> 08:16.447
But very nice.
Oh, as nice as nice can be.

08:21.967 --> 08:24.166
I'm going to see Jarvis today

08:24.167 --> 08:27.726
and find out what houses
are available. Do you have to?

08:27.727 --> 08:32.086
These are our last days here. I
thought something might've turned up

08:32.087 --> 08:34.645
while we were away
but it seems it hasn't.

08:34.647 --> 08:38.846
Would you rather wait till we have
to go and find a new house then?

08:38.847 --> 08:43.167
After all, darling, you're the one
who's pushing us out.

08:57.074 --> 08:59.074
Not for me, thank you.

09:09.490 --> 09:12.889
But Mary's only just got back
from honeymoon.

09:12.890 --> 09:16.089
It's her family time. But you are...

09:16.335 --> 09:19.495
Stop saying I'm family when I'm not.

09:19.791 --> 09:23.111
I'll be there
for the big dinner next week.

09:23.631 --> 09:27.750
What is it? I know
you don't mean to hurt me, but...

09:27.751 --> 09:31.670
Of course I don't. That's
the last thing I'd wish to do.

09:31.671 --> 09:36.190
Then why do you shove me away?
I don't want to, not at all, but...

09:36.191 --> 09:40.230
If you're going to talk about your
wretched arm again, I won't listen.

09:40.231 --> 09:43.790
It's not just my arm.
I'm too old for you.

09:43.791 --> 09:47.430
You need a young chap
with his life ahead of him.

09:47.431 --> 09:51.910
Your life's ahead of you. If you
knew how much I want to believe that.

09:51.911 --> 09:53.870
Then it's settled.

09:53.871 --> 09:56.350
You're not going
to push me away any more

09:56.351 --> 10:01.471
and you are coming for dinner
tonight. That's all there is to it.

10:09.831 --> 10:13.190
How did you get on with Vera's book?

10:13.191 --> 10:16.510
I had a few answers
waiting for me when I got back

10:16.511 --> 10:18.710
and two returned "address unknown".

10:18.711 --> 10:22.790
Who from? Let me see, one was
a Mr Harlip, I think,

10:22.791 --> 10:26.111
and the other was Mrs Bartlett.

10:26.831 --> 10:31.390
He doesn't matter, he was a cousin
in the north, she never saw him,

10:31.391 --> 10:33.710
but Mrs Bartlett's a shame.

10:33.711 --> 10:37.871
She lived on the corner, she
was very friendly. I'll find her.

10:39.151 --> 10:41.230
Tell me about France.

10:41.231 --> 10:43.951
Did you eat frog's legs
and dance the can-can?

10:44.951 --> 10:48.471
No, but I bought a garter.

10:54.071 --> 10:56.191
You've had no other symptoms?

10:56.591 --> 10:58.750
Not that I'm aware of.

10:58.751 --> 11:01.270
You're not feeling ill or tired?

11:01.271 --> 11:04.230
I can't swear to not feeling tired

11:04.231 --> 11:06.430
but nothing out of the ordinary.

11:06.431 --> 11:08.470
Very well.

11:08.471 --> 11:11.910
I'm going to conduct
a preliminary examination.

11:11.911 --> 11:13.791
Do you mind if I stay?

11:14.591 --> 11:16.631
I should prefer it.

11:20.551 --> 11:23.670
What have you got there?
Mr Matthew's tailcoat.

11:23.671 --> 11:26.590
What do you think that is?
Hard to say.

11:26.591 --> 11:29.150
I've tried everything
but I can't shift it.

11:29.151 --> 11:33.350
I'll give you a tip, if you like.
Would you, really? Yeah.

11:33.351 --> 11:37.511
Keep it to yourself, don't want
to give away all my secrets.

11:41.151 --> 11:44.871
Oh, there you are, my dear.
Good morning, Granny.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.350
I've been looking for you.

11:47.351 --> 11:51.031
Now I want to know if we're serious,

11:51.471 --> 11:55.510
about getting that woman, about
asking your other grandmother

11:55.511 --> 11:57.790
to come to our aid.
She's made of money

11:57.791 --> 12:02.070
and there's only Mama and Uncle
Harold to share it when she's gone.

12:02.071 --> 12:05.350
We can't wait that long,
she'll bury us all.

12:05.351 --> 12:07.830
No, we must act now.

12:07.831 --> 12:12.990
We must make her feel
it is her duty to save Downton.

12:12.991 --> 12:17.151
But how? What can we do?
Get her to sense its value,

12:17.751 --> 12:20.550
its vital role in the area.

12:20.551 --> 12:22.710
You're her granddaughter.

12:22.711 --> 12:25.710
This will be your house
if it survives.

12:25.711 --> 12:30.030
Surely you can make something
of that if she has a heart at all.

12:30.031 --> 12:32.510
We'll come for tea this afternoon.

12:32.511 --> 12:34.751
Then we can begin.

12:35.991 --> 12:40.070
There are several stages to go
through before a cause for despair.

12:40.071 --> 12:44.230
What stages? When you come back
in a day or two,

12:44.231 --> 12:46.310
I'll remove fluid from the cyst.

12:46.311 --> 12:49.590
With luck it'll be clear
and that will be that.

12:49.591 --> 12:52.430
How will you do it? With a syringe.

12:52.431 --> 12:57.030
Will it hurt? Since he has to do
it, whether it hurts or not,

12:57.031 --> 12:59.510
there's no point to that question.

12:59.511 --> 13:03.990
What I want to know is what happens
if the fluid is not clear?

13:03.991 --> 13:08.911
It'll be sent away for analysis.
Because it may be... cancer?

13:10.951 --> 13:14.710
It may be cancer
but I'm fairly certain it is not.

13:14.711 --> 13:19.951
There you are. It's very, very
unlikely, isn't it, Doctor?

13:21.271 --> 13:23.910
If the doctor treats me
like an adult,

13:23.911 --> 13:26.391
why do insist on
treating me like a child?

13:30.351 --> 13:33.551
Does this seem slow to you?
Not really.

13:35.951 --> 13:39.871
Mrs Levinson's going to the
Dower House with the others for tea.

13:42.511 --> 13:44.551
I think he likes me.

13:44.871 --> 13:47.151
He's being friendly, that's all.

13:54.871 --> 13:59.230
Are you all right? You seem to have
been slaving away for hours.

13:59.231 --> 14:03.230
I want to be up to date
before I get back to the office.

14:03.231 --> 14:06.071
Anything from Mr Swire's lawyer?

14:08.911 --> 14:11.391
You can read it if you like.

14:13.071 --> 14:17.150
So you are definitely
Reggie's heir?

14:17.151 --> 14:21.110
Looks like it, but if they have
to get a death certificate

14:21.111 --> 14:25.910
out of the Indian authorities, it
won't be settled by Tuesday. Good.

14:25.911 --> 14:30.150
Why is it good? The delay may give
you time to change your mind.

14:30.151 --> 14:32.910
Stop punishing me, Mary, please.

14:32.911 --> 14:36.950
If I accepted the legacy, I'd take
money under false pretences.

14:36.951 --> 14:41.030
I'd be stealing. Your father
understands now why can't you?

14:41.031 --> 14:44.670
He doesn't understand,
he just doesn't want to beg.

14:44.671 --> 14:48.111
Anyway, I'm off to Granny's for tea.
See you later.

14:50.911 --> 14:53.190
I do love you so terribly much.

14:53.191 --> 14:55.991
Yes, I know you do.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.630
So what's Harold doing now?

15:07.631 --> 15:10.510
His idee fixe is yachts.

15:10.511 --> 15:12.670
Bigger yachts, faster yachts.

15:12.671 --> 15:15.030
Something with yachts.

15:15.031 --> 15:18.790
Is he happy? He's much
too busy to find out.

15:18.791 --> 15:23.390
It always seems so strange to me
that Cora has a brother. Why?

15:23.391 --> 15:27.590
If there's a boy, the daughters
don't get anything.

15:27.591 --> 15:31.630
There's no such thing as
an English heiress with a brother.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.750
Why do we never see him?

15:33.751 --> 15:36.270
Harold hates to leave America.

15:36.271 --> 15:39.510
Curious. He hates to leave America.

15:39.511 --> 15:41.871
I should hate to go there.

15:42.471 --> 15:44.750
You don't mean that, Granny,

15:44.751 --> 15:47.031
when we're both so drawn to America.

15:47.551 --> 15:51.231
Indeed, indeed we are.
Never more than now,

15:51.831 --> 15:55.870
when the bond between the Crawleys
and Levinsons is so strong.

15:55.871 --> 15:58.351
That's nice, if you mean it, Mama.

15:58.871 --> 16:00.630
I do.

16:00.631 --> 16:05.070
It is marvellous the way
our families support each other.

16:05.071 --> 16:10.430
You mean you needed the Levinson
cash to keep the Crawleys on top?

16:10.431 --> 16:12.710
I'm not sure we'd put it that way.

16:12.711 --> 16:17.230
I'm quite sure we would not.
But I hope you feel Mama's fortune

16:17.231 --> 16:21.991
has been well spent in shoring up
an ancient family. Hm.

16:22.831 --> 16:25.391
You gotta spend it on something!

16:31.791 --> 16:34.271
What happened here? I...

16:34.831 --> 16:36.710
I just...

16:36.711 --> 16:40.590
You just what? There was a mark.
I know there was a mark,

16:40.591 --> 16:44.750
but you didn't need to burn it away.
What have you done?

16:44.751 --> 16:49.030
I'll go down in my dinner jacket,
send it to my tailor in the morning.

16:49.031 --> 16:52.711
Come on, nobody's died,
just find the dinner jacket.

16:55.271 --> 16:59.630
There don't seem to be any glasses
for the pudding wine.

16:59.631 --> 17:02.990
Are they having one tonight?
It's on the menus.

17:02.991 --> 17:06.630
I don't write them
for my own amusement. I dare say not.

17:06.631 --> 17:09.589
I am trying, and so far failing,

17:09.590 --> 17:13.829
to persuade his lordship to bring
the staff levels back up to snuff,

17:13.830 --> 17:17.830
but until he does it is vital
that you pull your weight.

17:22.951 --> 17:25.670
Newport's not a jungle, not at all,

17:25.671 --> 17:28.550
but it is a little less formal.

17:28.550 --> 17:32.830
Matthew obviously wants you to feel
at home in his play clothes.

17:32.831 --> 17:36.350
Don't blame me. Alfred and I
had a disaster earlier.

17:36.351 --> 17:40.150
What happened? He managed
to burn a hole in my tails.

17:40.151 --> 17:43.030
Don't worry, it can be mended.
Careful, Carson.

17:43.031 --> 17:45.310
I beg your pardon, my lord.

17:45.311 --> 17:49.750
I like dinner jackets, sometimes
it's nice to be informal.

17:49.751 --> 17:52.150
Especially when a couple is alone.

17:52.151 --> 17:56.430
People like us should lead the fight
to keep tradition going.

17:56.431 --> 18:00.550
If you mean we can never change,
I can't agree. Nor me.

18:00.551 --> 18:04.750
Accepting change is as important
as defending the past.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.190
The role of houses like Downton
is to protect tradition.

18:08.191 --> 18:12.590
That's why they're so important
to maintain. Don't you agree?

18:12.591 --> 18:16.630
We must do everything in our power
to keep Downton going. Sure,

18:16.631 --> 18:20.911
if you think it's worth it. Who's
coming to dinner next week?

18:22.271 --> 18:26.030
Locals. We thought you'd like to see
Downton on parade.

18:26.031 --> 18:29.110
That's right. I'm glad
we've planned a dinner.

18:29.111 --> 18:31.551
We can show you
the real point of Downton.

18:33.511 --> 18:35.870
I don't know what to say, Mr Carson.

18:35.871 --> 18:40.150
What's going on here? Alfred has
embarrassed the family.

18:40.151 --> 18:44.390
He forced Mr Matthew to appear
downstairs improperly dressed.

18:44.391 --> 18:48.830
You make it sound quite exciting.
I will not tolerate vulgarity.

18:48.831 --> 18:51.871
I'm sure Alfred didn't mean to. Hm.

18:53.711 --> 18:57.750
I asked Thomas... Hey, what's this?
The stuff you gave me

18:57.751 --> 19:02.470
burned a hole in the tails.
I gave you some soda crystals.

19:02.471 --> 19:05.150
If you use them wrongly,
it's not my fault.

19:05.151 --> 19:09.271
This is what comes of making him run
before he could walk.

19:14.511 --> 19:17.510
If you want me to stay away
from her, I will.

19:17.511 --> 19:19.870
I know it sounds harsh.

19:19.871 --> 19:22.150
Please, I understand completely.

19:22.151 --> 19:26.230
Edith's your daughter, you don't
want her seeing an old cripple.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.511
Now you're the one who's harsh.

19:29.431 --> 19:32.070
The trouble is
she calls round regularly.

19:32.071 --> 19:35.430
I can hardly ask her
not to be admitted.

19:35.431 --> 19:37.711
I suppose I could write to her.

19:38.791 --> 19:42.710
I hope you won't feel
we can't be friends after this.

19:42.711 --> 19:47.110
Let's leave it for a while. I'll
duck out of the dinner next week.

19:47.111 --> 19:49.791
It might be best. Thank you.

19:53.271 --> 19:57.070
That's the one you should've taken,
soda crystals.

19:57.071 --> 20:01.431
But he didn't give me that,
he pointed to this one. I promise.

20:03.071 --> 20:06.271
You don't have to promise,
I believe you.

20:09.725 --> 20:12.125
So you think he's not ready?

20:13.005 --> 20:14.804
He's just a lad, my lord.

20:14.805 --> 20:19.284
He can see to the odd visitor,
but permanent valet to Mr Matthew?

20:19.285 --> 20:23.964
It's too much. I'm pretty sure Mr
Crawley'd rather manage on his own.

20:23.965 --> 20:26.484
They wouldn't like that
downstairs, my lord.

20:26.485 --> 20:28.564
I was afraid you'd say that.

20:28.565 --> 20:30.565
So what would you suggest?

20:31.725 --> 20:34.164
Ask Mr Molesley to join us.

20:34.165 --> 20:36.804
It'd be kinder to Alfred
in the long run,

20:36.805 --> 20:39.525
kinder than asking
more than he can give.

20:47.765 --> 20:51.964
How is that poor footman? I thought
Carson would eat him alive.

20:51.965 --> 20:55.044
Very glum. To be honest,
he has been a clot.

20:55.045 --> 20:59.004
I'll have to send the coat to London.
Get it done quickly.

20:59.005 --> 21:02.044
This dinner has to be
the grandest of the grand.

21:02.045 --> 21:05.604
What do you hope to show her?
Why Downton matters,

21:05.605 --> 21:07.884
why it mustn't fall apart.

21:07.885 --> 21:10.684
Hasn't Cora had her share
of Levinson gold?

21:10.685 --> 21:13.084
What's left is headed for your uncle.

21:13.085 --> 21:15.204
He's as rich as Croesus as it is.

21:15.205 --> 21:19.684
So you mean to fleece her? Since you
could get us out of this hole,

21:19.685 --> 21:22.324
I won't take any criticism,
thank you.

21:22.325 --> 21:26.764
Will she do it? Granny
will make her or die in the attempt.

21:26.765 --> 21:30.165
Now stop talking and kiss me
before I get cross.

21:33.485 --> 21:36.285
You heard him,
you'll know at once.

21:37.605 --> 21:40.644
I wish you could get
those maids under control.

21:40.645 --> 21:44.284
They've broken one of the serving
dishes this time.

21:44.285 --> 21:48.484
We're short of a footman, a kitchen
maid and one house maid at least,

21:48.485 --> 21:53.084
that's if Anna's to be a proper
lady's maid, what Lady Mary wants.

21:53.085 --> 21:55.564
Naturally. She likes things
done properly.

21:55.565 --> 22:00.604
We can't do things properly until
his lordship allows us the staff

22:00.605 --> 22:03.324
or until you and
the blessed Lady Mary

22:03.325 --> 22:06.644
come down from that cloud
and join the human race!

22:06.645 --> 22:10.244
I can only suppose
you are over-tired. Good night.

22:10.245 --> 22:12.604
You see, she...
Good night, Mr Carson.

22:12.605 --> 22:16.124
We will discuss the dinner
in the morning.

22:16.125 --> 22:17.845
Hm.

22:19.925 --> 22:23.285
And no, Mrs Patmore,
you may not tell him.

22:27.045 --> 22:29.764
Oh. Have you finished
with Mr Matthew?

22:29.765 --> 22:33.364
I have. He's in the dining room.
You won't need

22:33.365 --> 22:37.404
to attend to him again, Mr Molesley
is coming up from the village.

22:37.405 --> 22:40.404
Has Mr Matthew complained?
It's not your fault,

22:40.405 --> 22:44.485
we've hurried you along too fast.
You mustn't feel badly.

22:48.285 --> 22:52.764
This is Thomas's doing,
but don't you fret,

22:52.765 --> 22:54.885
I'll make him sorry.

23:16.725 --> 23:19.164
I'm on your side.

23:19.165 --> 23:21.565
I'm glad somebody is.

23:31.485 --> 23:36.764
No Mary? She's a married woman now
so she can have breakfast in bed.

23:36.765 --> 23:39.364
Hm. I'm sorry about your tails.

23:39.365 --> 23:43.644
Carson's sending them up
on the London train this morning.

23:43.645 --> 23:45.884
They'll have to put a new panel in.

23:45.885 --> 23:50.124
We thought we'd get Molesley
to come and look after you.

23:50.125 --> 23:52.884
He knows your ways.
I'm perfectly happy...

23:52.885 --> 23:57.684
I think it best if he comes. I must
talk to you about the staff we need.

23:57.685 --> 24:02.485
Not now, Carson. Send for Molesley
if Mrs Crawley has no objection.

24:06.365 --> 24:08.245
Edith?

24:09.525 --> 24:11.525
Oh, Papa, how could you?

24:16.685 --> 24:19.805
Crawley, do you know what that was?

24:20.325 --> 24:22.405
I'm afraid I probably do.

24:25.605 --> 24:28.884
I'm sorry but enough
of my father's money

24:28.885 --> 24:31.444
has already been poured into Downton.

24:31.445 --> 24:35.324
Why should Harold lose half
his inheritance for our folly?

24:35.325 --> 24:39.084
So it's all Papa's fault? It isn't
my mother's or brother's.

24:39.085 --> 24:43.044
I don't see why they should pay
for it. We'll still ask.

24:43.045 --> 24:47.084
What are you so afraid of? If we
sell, we move to a smaller house

24:47.085 --> 24:51.124
and a more modest estate.
We don't have to go down the mine.

24:51.125 --> 24:55.164
You don't understand. Mary, a lot
of people live in smaller houses

24:55.165 --> 24:59.404
than they used to. Which shows
you're American and I'm English.

24:59.405 --> 25:03.444
I shall be Countess of Grantham
one day and the Countess of Grantham

25:03.445 --> 25:05.685
lives at Downton Abbey.

25:15.445 --> 25:18.125
'What job might you be suited to?'

25:18.525 --> 25:23.845
We're not here to give you food, we
want you to find your place in life.

25:27.445 --> 25:29.765
Do you want to speak to me?

25:30.685 --> 25:32.685
Yes, Mrs Crawley, I do.

25:34.245 --> 25:38.285
Have you come for our help?
You're very welcome if you have.

25:40.645 --> 25:42.765
Wait a minute, I know you.

25:43.805 --> 25:47.844
You were the maid who brought
your child

25:47.845 --> 25:52.764
into the dining room at Downton.
Sorry, this has been a mistake.

25:52.765 --> 25:56.805
I thought I was ready to ask you
but I'm not. I'm not ready.

25:56.965 --> 25:58.885
Ask me what?

26:04.525 --> 26:06.885
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting, ladies.

26:08.005 --> 26:10.044
It's not quite as simple.

26:10.045 --> 26:14.965
Oh, my God! Mrs Patmore, will you
please leave the hysteria to me?

26:16.085 --> 26:18.804
I'm afraid the test
was inconclusive.

26:18.805 --> 26:23.724
I had hoped the fluid from the cyst
would be clear but there's blood,

26:23.725 --> 26:26.284
not enough to confirm the presence

26:26.285 --> 26:28.805
of cancer but too much
to exclude it.

26:30.245 --> 26:32.284
So what happens now?

26:32.285 --> 26:36.404
I send it away for analysis
and this stage will take some time.

26:36.405 --> 26:38.804
How much time?
Anything up to two months.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.804
Oh, my...

26:40.805 --> 26:44.404
Until then, try
to take it more easy.

26:44.405 --> 26:46.884
Sit down and put
your feet up if you can.

26:46.885 --> 26:49.124
Chance'd be a fine thing.

26:49.125 --> 26:52.804
Would you like me to say something
to Lady Grantham?

26:52.805 --> 26:57.444
No, thank you, Doctor, I'll speak
to her myself if I need to.

26:57.445 --> 26:59.325
Thank you.

27:04.165 --> 27:06.644
My darling girl, what's this?

27:06.645 --> 27:10.164
I think you know, since you asked
Sir Anthony to write.

27:10.165 --> 27:13.804
Edith, you understand I only want
what's best for you.

27:13.805 --> 27:16.804
And you're the judge of that?
In this.

27:16.805 --> 27:20.244
Sybil marries a chauffeur
and you welcome him here,

27:20.245 --> 27:25.764
but when I love a gentleman, you
cast him out. She has a point.

27:25.765 --> 27:31.644
Strallan is certainly a gentleman.
Besides which he has a house,

27:31.645 --> 27:36.244
he has money, a title, everything
that you care about.

27:36.245 --> 27:38.684
You make me sound very shallow.
Aren't you

27:38.685 --> 27:42.364
when you make me give him up
because he has a bad arm?

27:42.365 --> 27:45.084
He's quarter of a century too old.

27:45.085 --> 27:49.044
Did she tell you that?
Your daughter is sad and lonely.

27:49.045 --> 27:52.524
Now I don't mean to interfere...
Don't you?

27:52.525 --> 27:56.084
If you ban him from Downton
I'll only go to his house.

27:56.085 --> 28:00.284
I don't believe he'd see you.
I'll wait outside until he does.

28:00.285 --> 28:02.884
How can you not like him
because of his age

28:02.885 --> 28:06.164
when almost every man
we grew up with is dead?

28:06.165 --> 28:10.245
Do you want me to spend my
life alone? I do like him very much.

28:10.885 --> 28:14.005
So do I, Papa. So do I.

28:15.405 --> 28:18.004
Please, ask him back.

28:18.005 --> 28:21.804
He writes he's not coming
to Mama's dinner. Please make him.

28:21.805 --> 28:23.965
Please, please, please.

28:26.605 --> 28:28.685
Oh, all right, then.

28:34.725 --> 28:37.324
I found Mrs Bartlett.

28:37.325 --> 28:40.724
I wrote back to the tenant
of the house explaining

28:40.725 --> 28:43.524
and they sent me
a forwarding address.

28:43.525 --> 28:46.004
I don't know why they didn't before.

28:46.005 --> 28:49.524
But it doesn't mean
she'll talk to you. Why not?

28:49.525 --> 28:53.524
Audrey Bartlett was the nearest
thing Vera had to a friend.

28:53.525 --> 28:57.324
That's why I want to meet her.
She won't see the real Anna Bates.

28:57.325 --> 29:01.164
She's doesn't have to like me.
I need her to be honest.

29:01.165 --> 29:03.644
I'm going to write
and ask for a meeting.

29:03.645 --> 29:05.884
I can get to London
and back in a day.

29:05.885 --> 29:07.724
She won't agree.

29:07.725 --> 29:11.884
I've the rent from the house,
I can make it worth her while.

29:11.885 --> 29:13.684
Why do you think Vera

29:13.685 --> 29:17.364
didn't go and see her instead
of sending that letter? Eh?

29:17.365 --> 29:20.324
When Vera was frightened
about your visit

29:20.325 --> 29:24.565
she wrote that letter saying how
scared she was instead of seeing her.

29:26.085 --> 29:28.325
Maybe she did both.

29:30.365 --> 29:32.084
So...

29:32.085 --> 29:34.084
what's the news at home?

29:34.085 --> 29:36.685
I shouldn't tell you, really.

29:37.805 --> 29:40.085
I haven't told any of the others.

29:40.885 --> 29:43.765
It's breaking the code
of a lady's maid.

29:44.645 --> 29:47.045
His lordship's in trouble.

29:48.885 --> 29:51.524
It seems he may have to sell.

29:51.525 --> 29:54.845
What? Sell Downton?

29:57.045 --> 29:59.045
That makes me sad.

30:01.325 --> 30:05.485
I wouldn't have thought much could
touch me in here, but that does.

30:22.805 --> 30:27.004
It hasn't come. They promised
and promised and I thought

30:27.005 --> 30:30.604
it was sure to be on the 7 o'clock
but it's not.

30:30.605 --> 30:33.324
I'll just have to wear a black tie.

30:33.325 --> 30:35.724
But Lady Mary, surely...

30:35.725 --> 30:40.045
These things don't matter as much
as they did, Lady Mary knows that.

30:54.165 --> 30:57.164
Thank you. I know I'm early...

30:57.165 --> 31:00.405
Granny, come and see
what we've done. Oh.

31:05.365 --> 31:07.405
What do you think?

31:07.885 --> 31:10.804
Nothing succeeds like excess.

31:10.805 --> 31:14.444
When shall we tackle her?
After dinner.

31:14.445 --> 31:18.444
We'll get her on her own. She
wouldn't want to see all this go,

31:18.445 --> 31:20.524
now it's for her granddaughter.

31:20.525 --> 31:25.165
Never mistake a wish for
a certainty. Let's hope she won't.

31:28.605 --> 31:32.604
Mrs Patmore. What is it now?
It's smoking, the range.

31:32.605 --> 31:35.884
The wind's in the wrong direction,
rake it through.

31:35.885 --> 31:38.845
Where's Alfred?!
In the servants' hall.

31:41.245 --> 31:45.445
Where are they? His what?
His bloody evening shirts!

31:46.645 --> 31:50.765
Where have you put them? I haven't
touched them. Why would I?

31:52.645 --> 31:57.245
Have you done this? Why would I
know anything about his shirts?

31:58.245 --> 32:02.444
When I find out... Keep your
histrionics to yourself. Hurry up.

32:02.445 --> 32:06.845
Her ladyship's in the drawing room.
His lordship's not even dressed?

32:12.085 --> 32:16.124
You can't have lost them all.
I haven't lost any of them.

32:16.125 --> 32:19.044
They've been taken
by someone, stolen.

32:19.045 --> 32:21.285
Why would they do that?
To get at me.

32:23.805 --> 32:26.124
Are you not popular downstairs?

32:26.125 --> 32:28.325
I wouldn't say that, my lord,

32:29.605 --> 32:31.884
but you know how people can be.

32:31.885 --> 32:35.804
They like a little joke.
This is quite unacceptable.

32:35.805 --> 32:38.564
If you uncover the culprit,
refer them to me,

32:38.565 --> 32:40.925
but for now what are we going to do?

32:58.045 --> 33:00.125
Good evening, Sir John.

33:05.285 --> 33:09.004
It can't be going out. There must be
a block in the flue.

33:09.005 --> 33:12.884
The dinner's not cooked,
we haven't put in the souffles.

33:12.885 --> 33:16.884
There'll be no souffles tonight.
What on earth is going on?

33:16.885 --> 33:20.444
We've 20 lords and ladies
in the drawing room

33:20.445 --> 33:25.245
waiting for dinner and we've got
no dinner to give them. Oh, my God.

33:29.096 --> 33:31.215
Why are you not in white tie?

33:31.216 --> 33:33.695
I'm afraid they never sent
my tails back.

33:33.696 --> 33:37.275
You are not in white tie, either.
What have you come as?

33:37.457 --> 33:41.816
I'm sorry, Thomas has lost my
dress shirts. Why is he still here?

33:41.854 --> 33:45.273
I thought you gave him his marching
orders. I had.

33:45.274 --> 33:49.513
My dear mother-in-law intervened.
I've a good mind to tell her...

33:49.514 --> 33:52.833
No, she must have it
all her own way tonight.

33:52.834 --> 33:56.873
You two are dressed for a barbecue.
I feel like a Chicago bootlegger.

33:56.874 --> 34:00.393
That sounds almost
as peculiar as you look.

34:00.394 --> 34:04.193
Come quickly. What is it?
The oven's broken down.

34:04.859 --> 34:07.218
It can't have. What does that mean?

34:07.219 --> 34:10.578
It means we have no food.
Oh.

34:10.579 --> 34:14.098
Funny clothes and no food.
Should be quite an evening.

34:14.099 --> 34:16.099
Thank you, Mother.

34:19.179 --> 34:23.058
Nothing's cooked
and nothing's going to be cooked.

34:23.059 --> 34:25.777
But surely...
Shall we tell them to go home?

34:25.779 --> 34:29.538
No, they've come for a party,
we'll give them a party.

34:29.539 --> 34:32.458
Clear the table,
go down to the larders,

34:32.458 --> 34:35.818
bring up bread, fruit, cheese,
chicken, ham.

34:35.819 --> 34:38.297
We're going to have
an indoor picnic.

34:38.299 --> 34:41.418
They're going to eat whatever
they want, wherever they want.

34:41.451 --> 34:44.730
Are you quite sure, madam?
It's not how we do it.

34:45.087 --> 34:49.206
How you used to do it.
It might be fun. I agree.

34:49.206 --> 34:52.485
We'll all pull together
and it'll be great fun. Yes!

34:52.487 --> 34:55.966
I know what we need.
Does anyone play the piano?

34:55.967 --> 34:58.726
This is so not
what we wanted it to be.

34:58.727 --> 35:03.167
If it's the end of your undignified
campaign, I won't be sorry.

35:04.287 --> 35:07.887
We can't just give up.
Certainly not.

35:08.727 --> 35:11.286
Do you think I might have a drink?

35:11.287 --> 35:14.807
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I thought you were a waiter.

35:16.527 --> 35:21.486
Slice that finely, fetch some
parsley, cut the dry bits off.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.886
Can I lend a hand?
I don't mind helping.

35:23.887 --> 35:27.926
I think it's good to do other things
sometimes. I know you do.

35:27.927 --> 35:32.086
There's not much left of this.
Cut it in squares, put it with ham.

35:32.087 --> 35:34.886
You're very smart
in your valet's outfit.

35:34.887 --> 35:37.326
Alfred, check the meat larder,

35:37.327 --> 35:41.447
bring anything back you think
a human being could swallow.

35:43.687 --> 35:47.726
Chop, chop, Mrs Hughes. We can rest
later but not yet. Mr Carson...

35:47.727 --> 35:51.247
Mr Carson's right,
there's not a minute to lose.

35:57.567 --> 36:00.247
Psst!

36:01.167 --> 36:05.246
Do you want to know a secret?
The shirts Thomas thinks he stole...

36:05.247 --> 36:08.326
I saw who took them
and I know where they are.

36:08.327 --> 36:11.086
Who did take them?
Never mind that,

36:11.087 --> 36:14.966
but I followed. I'll show you
if you want.

36:14.967 --> 36:17.766
Why are you being so nice to me?

36:17.767 --> 36:22.366
Because I like you. And you can
say it, just like that?

36:22.367 --> 36:25.647
I'm an American, Alfred,
and this is 1920.

36:26.687 --> 36:28.726
Time to live a little.

36:28.727 --> 36:33.526
I thought you was trying to find
something about for Mrs Levinson.

36:33.527 --> 36:38.246
Find out what when she reads them
like the palm of her hand?

36:38.247 --> 36:41.406
She won't help, you know?
Help with what?

36:41.407 --> 36:45.007
Never mind. Just kiss me again.

36:50.687 --> 36:54.886
Now, all of you find whatever it is
that you want to eat

36:54.887 --> 36:57.366
and take it wherever
you want to sit.

36:57.367 --> 36:59.326
Anywhere? Anywhere.

36:59.327 --> 37:04.526
If you have ever wanted to explore
Downton, this is your chance.

37:04.527 --> 37:08.006
I'm sorry if it's all a bit casual.
It's exciting.

37:08.007 --> 37:11.966
I feel like the bright young people
they write about.

37:11.967 --> 37:15.766
Thank you, Lady Mellendorf.
Cheer up, she won't be here forever.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.926
How much damage will be done
before she goes?

37:18.927 --> 37:23.366
♪ Let me call you "Sweetheart"

37:23.367 --> 37:29.127
♪ I'm in love with you

37:30.087 --> 37:34.006
♪ Let me hear you whisper

37:34.007 --> 37:39.527
♪ That you love me too

37:41.327 --> 37:46.686
♪ Keep the love-light glowing

37:46.687 --> 37:51.487
♪ In your eyes so true

37:52.607 --> 37:57.087
♪ Let me call you "Sweetheart"

37:57.407 --> 38:01.687
♪ I'm in love

38:02.727 --> 38:06.206
♪ With

38:06.207 --> 38:08.127
♪ You ♪

38:13.447 --> 38:16.327
Is there anything for our supper?

38:16.807 --> 38:18.927
I've taken a veal and egg pie.

38:20.127 --> 38:23.606
Oh, I wish you'd let me talk
to Mr Carson.

38:23.607 --> 38:27.647
I don't want to be a sick woman in
his eyes for the next two months,

38:28.527 --> 38:31.887
or a dying one in the months
to come after that.

38:35.447 --> 38:38.527
Shh. I know it'll be all right.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.526
No, you don't,

38:43.527 --> 38:45.887
but I appreciate the sentiment.

38:47.087 --> 38:50.006
Are you sure you won't wake up
in ten years

38:50.007 --> 38:53.406
and wonder why you're tied
to this crippled codger?

38:53.407 --> 38:56.006
Only if you keep talking like that.

38:56.007 --> 38:58.647
Do you know how much you mean to me?

38:59.767 --> 39:02.046
You have given me back my life.

39:02.047 --> 39:03.887
That's more like it.

39:10.207 --> 39:14.246
You won't wait? To give you
the chance to change your mind?

39:14.247 --> 39:18.046
Don't worry, I can get it
organized in a month.

39:18.047 --> 39:20.606
Shall we tell them tonight?

39:20.607 --> 39:23.727
No, no, I'll come back
in the morning.

39:29.207 --> 39:33.206
Can I ask you something? Why do you
like that American girl?

39:33.207 --> 39:36.006
Steady. Who says I do? Don't you?

39:36.007 --> 39:40.086
I suppose I do. And it doesn't
matter that she's fast

39:40.087 --> 39:43.686
or that you won't see her again
after she's gone home?

39:43.687 --> 39:48.726
She made me feel good about myself
for the first time here. Alfred!

39:48.727 --> 39:52.366
Hurry up, I need you
to take around the claret.

39:52.367 --> 39:54.766
Won't they spill it on the floor?

39:54.767 --> 39:58.886
If you ask me, we are staring
into the chaos of Gomorrah,

39:58.887 --> 40:03.206
but we have to give them more wine
and you are going to help.

40:03.207 --> 40:07.206
What's that? I have to take it
upstairs for his lordship.

40:07.207 --> 40:09.247
Well, be quick about it.

40:11.127 --> 40:14.966
I'll help you any way I can.
Thank heavens.

40:14.967 --> 40:18.846
It seems our family owes Downton's
survival

40:18.847 --> 40:22.086
to the Levinsons not once but twice.

40:22.087 --> 40:26.246
No. I'm so sorry,
but you've misunderstood me.

40:26.247 --> 40:30.646
I cannot rescue Downton.
It's a shame if it has to go,

40:30.647 --> 40:33.846
but I can't. But why not?

40:33.847 --> 40:36.806
Because your grandpa
tied the money down.

40:36.807 --> 40:39.966
He felt the Crawley family
had quite enough.

40:39.967 --> 40:42.286
But you said you'd help us.

40:42.287 --> 40:46.846
I can entertain all of you
in Newport and in New York

40:46.847 --> 40:51.006
and I can add to Cora's dress
allowance, but that's all.

40:51.007 --> 40:54.446
My income is generous
but I cannot touch the capital.

40:54.447 --> 40:58.286
Besides, Mary,
the world has changed.

40:58.287 --> 41:01.406
These houses were built
for another age.

41:01.407 --> 41:06.486
Are you sure you want to continue
with the bother of it all?

41:06.487 --> 41:11.847
Quite sure. If I knew I was going to
lose it, I'd look on the sunny side.

41:13.527 --> 41:18.487
Both of our husbands tied the money
up tight before they were taken.

41:19.887 --> 41:22.447
Lord Grantham wasn't taken.

41:23.447 --> 41:25.247
He died.

41:39.687 --> 41:42.966
I suppose it's scraps
for the servants tonight?

41:42.967 --> 41:45.087
Mrs Patmore's kept something by.

41:46.007 --> 41:48.087
Who put them back?

41:48.567 --> 41:52.406
What? The shirts,
who put them back?

41:52.407 --> 41:56.326
They're back? You mean you
overlooked them in the first place.

41:56.327 --> 41:58.366
Don't tell me what I mean.

41:58.367 --> 42:04.486
I'm warning you. You sound like Tom
Mix in a Wild-West picture show!

42:04.487 --> 42:08.527
Stop warning me and go lay out
his lordship's pyjamas.

42:10.847 --> 42:15.126
What are you laughing at? Those
missing shirts went for a walk

42:15.127 --> 42:18.287
and now they've come home.
Really? Have they?

42:26.767 --> 42:29.527
You didn't see nothing. I agree.

42:30.607 --> 42:33.167
Cos if you did I'll cut ya.

42:43.087 --> 42:44.807
Oh!

42:50.367 --> 42:52.447
Don't ever threaten me.

42:54.527 --> 42:58.327
I forgot I was sharing a cell
with a murderer.

42:59.887 --> 43:01.887
Don't forget it again.

43:14.967 --> 43:18.247
This evening has made me homesick
for America.

43:19.047 --> 43:21.047
It's time to go.

43:22.527 --> 43:25.726
I don't suppose you want some whisky
to take to bed?

43:25.727 --> 43:28.887
Oh, but I'd love one. No water.

43:35.287 --> 43:37.166
Thank you.

43:37.167 --> 43:40.887
I'm sorry I can't help you
keep Downton, Robert.

43:45.327 --> 43:47.406
That's what Mary wanted.

43:47.407 --> 43:49.127
Ah.

43:49.967 --> 43:52.006
I thought there was something.

43:52.007 --> 43:55.166
You know, the way
to deal with the world today

43:55.167 --> 43:59.206
is not to ignore it. If you do
you'll just get hurt.

43:59.207 --> 44:02.286
Sometimes, I feel like a creature
in the wilds

44:02.287 --> 44:05.846
whose natural habitat
is gradually being destroyed.

44:05.847 --> 44:09.446
Some animals adapt
to new surroundings.

44:09.447 --> 44:12.007
It seems a better choice
than extinction.

44:13.487 --> 44:15.646
I don't think it is a choice.

44:15.647 --> 44:17.967
I think it's what's in you.

44:18.887 --> 44:22.926
Let's hope that what's in you will
carry you through these times

44:22.927 --> 44:24.847
to a safer shore.

44:38.767 --> 44:41.086
Is everything all right?

44:41.087 --> 44:42.847
Certainly.

44:43.847 --> 44:46.527
Was there something you wanted?

44:48.047 --> 44:52.246
The kitchen managed well tonight
in difficult circumstances.

44:52.247 --> 44:54.567
His lordship sent his thanks.

44:55.687 --> 44:57.926
Was the evening a success?

44:57.927 --> 45:01.006
The odd thing is I think it was.

45:01.007 --> 45:04.046
For me, everyone sprawled
on the floor

45:04.047 --> 45:08.766
eating like beaters at a break
in the shooting isn't a party,

45:08.767 --> 45:10.806
it's a works outing.

45:10.807 --> 45:14.126
Where's the style, Mrs Hughes?
Where's the show?

45:14.127 --> 45:17.606
Perhaps people are tired
of style and show.

45:17.607 --> 45:21.726
Well, in my opinion,
to misquote Dr Johnson,

45:21.727 --> 45:24.926
if you're tired of style,
you are tired of life.

45:24.927 --> 45:27.727
Hm. Good night, Mr Carson.

45:29.407 --> 45:32.687
You'd say if anything
was wrong, wouldn't you?

45:33.807 --> 45:38.207
I know I've been a bit crabby,
but I am on your side.

45:39.767 --> 45:41.607
Thank you for that.

45:58.487 --> 46:03.926
You've just missed an admirer.
Mr Carson says you did well tonight.

46:03.927 --> 46:06.607
Oh. Did you tell him?

46:07.447 --> 46:09.167
No.

46:10.247 --> 46:12.367
What is there to tell?

46:13.287 --> 46:15.527
One day I will die.

46:16.447 --> 46:18.486
And so will he. And you.

46:18.487 --> 46:21.047
And every one of us under this roof.

46:23.847 --> 46:27.647

46:28.487 --> 46:30.607
and I think I can do that now.

46:44.207 --> 46:47.486
'Something happening
in this house is about me.'

46:47.487 --> 46:50.486
'Strallan is
the traditional choice.'

46:50.487 --> 46:53.646

as an old man's drudge.

46:57.687 --> 47:01.686

I could open a shop.
Fashionably late is one thing.

47:08.887 --> 47:11.406

47:11.407 --> 47:14.167
'she'd hate to think
the doctor told you.'

47:15.305 --> 47:21.270
