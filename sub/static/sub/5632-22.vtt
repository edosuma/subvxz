00:00.079 --> 00:01.137
Previously on
<i>Bones...</i>

00:01.161 --> 00:02.991
Body was found
in Cherrywood Park.

00:03.015 --> 00:04.735
Somebody wanted the body
to be found.

00:04.736 --> 00:07.201
<i>The evidence collected</i>
<i>is far from... normal.</i>

00:07.301 --> 00:08.828
<i>His name is George Gibbons.</i>

00:08.928 --> 00:09.722
<i>George, look at me.</i>

00:09.822 --> 00:11.455
I need to know
who you're working with.

00:11.491 --> 00:12.873
Oh, my God, he didn't do it.

00:12.909 --> 00:14.692
In Gibbons, he chose
the perfect accomplice,

00:14.727 --> 00:16.376
somebody he could
easily manipulate.

00:16.412 --> 00:18.879
A video camera?
Someone was watching <i>him.</i>

00:18.915 --> 00:20.131
He's smart.

00:20.166 --> 00:21.916
He's smarter than anybody.

00:21.968 --> 00:24.251
If I talk, he'll know.

00:24.303 --> 00:25.336
Gibbons is dead.

00:25.388 --> 00:26.921
Hanged himself
in his cell.

00:26.923 --> 00:29.590
<i>Our killer drilled holes</i>
<i>into his victims.</i>

00:29.592 --> 00:31.092
<i>He lived with the body</i>

00:31.144 --> 00:33.310
<i>for an extended period of time.</i>

00:33.346 --> 00:34.428
Oh, my God.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.230
He was turning his victims

00:36.265 --> 00:38.065
into marionettes.

00:38.101 --> 00:40.301
We're not dealing
with an amateur psychopath.

00:40.336 --> 00:41.986
This guy's a serial murderer.

00:42.021 --> 00:44.655
Given the killer's M.O.,
it is very likely

00:44.690 --> 00:47.825
he is out there looking for
his next victim as we speak.

00:47.860 --> 00:49.827
You're not taking responsibility for all this.
Booth. Booth.

00:49.862 --> 00:51.278
If we hadn't quit our jobs...

00:51.314 --> 00:52.947
Allison Monroe still
would have been killed.

00:52.999 --> 00:55.332
The cameras were still
transmitting when I found them,

00:55.368 --> 00:57.952
<i>which means the killer</i>
<i>could've been watching</i>

00:58.004 --> 00:59.954
<i>when Booth and Brennan</i>
<i>came to the house.</i>

00:59.956 --> 01:01.455
<i>This very sick individual</i>

01:01.457 --> 01:03.524
<i>could know exactly who we are.</i>

01:06.796 --> 01:08.596
The victim has
fourth-degree burns

01:08.631 --> 01:11.132
extending along
the length of the body.

01:11.134 --> 01:12.600
His hands are badly damaged.

01:12.635 --> 01:15.436
Dr. Hodgins, can you tell
what caused the explosion?

01:15.471 --> 01:17.471
Based on the smell, I'd say
it's some kind of peroxide,

01:17.523 --> 01:19.140
possibly TCAP.

01:19.192 --> 01:20.293
I'll run a sample through

01:20.317 --> 01:22.194
the Gas Chromatograph/
Mass Spectrometry.

01:22.195 --> 01:23.644
Poor guy.

01:23.646 --> 01:26.063
His face looks like
molten lava.

01:26.115 --> 01:27.565
I'll get started on the
facial reconstruction.

01:27.617 --> 01:30.484
Oh, please do so
as quickly as possible.

01:30.486 --> 01:32.153
I am certain that
the victim's identity

01:32.155 --> 01:34.038
is the key to finding
our killer.

01:34.073 --> 01:36.490
Based on what?
You just laid eyes on the guy.

01:36.492 --> 01:37.825
Well, I can't explain it,

01:37.827 --> 01:39.326
but for some reason,
when I look at him,

01:39.328 --> 01:41.128
I am confident he is the key.

01:41.164 --> 01:43.280
I hate to say it,
but I think you might be right.

01:43.316 --> 01:44.832
This guy is
different.

01:44.884 --> 01:45.966
Check this out.

01:46.002 --> 01:47.334
There's a drill hole

01:47.336 --> 01:48.786
in the left clavicle.

01:48.821 --> 01:51.071
All the serial killer's victims

01:51.107 --> 01:52.306
had drill holes, Hodgins.

01:52.341 --> 01:53.507
It's how he hung them

01:53.509 --> 01:55.009
like marionettes.

01:55.011 --> 01:56.727
Yeah, I know, but...

01:56.762 --> 01:58.145
look closer.

02:03.820 --> 02:05.603
No, this is an aberrant event.

02:05.655 --> 02:08.521
He's dead. Postmortem injuries
don't typically bleed.

02:08.524 --> 02:11.325
You sure about that?

02:11.360 --> 02:15.162
Looks to me
like old wounds can cut deep.

02:25.575 --> 02:27.408
Bones.

02:27.460 --> 02:30.077
Bones!

02:30.079 --> 02:31.328
You okay?

02:31.380 --> 02:33.914
Yes, I'm fine.

02:33.916 --> 02:36.417
How long was I sleeping?

02:36.469 --> 02:37.885
Well, not-not long.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.421
For probably about
half an hour.

02:41.557 --> 02:43.891
That means we must be near.

02:47.563 --> 02:49.146
I should check my kit.

02:49.182 --> 02:51.432
Make sure I'm ready.

02:52.568 --> 02:54.101
You had another one, didn't you?

02:54.103 --> 02:56.320
It's just another dream.

02:56.355 --> 02:58.072
It's nothing you need
to concern yourself with.

02:58.107 --> 03:00.241
Bones, what are you...
How can you say that?

03:00.276 --> 03:01.859
I mean, you haven't slept
in a week.

03:01.911 --> 03:03.827
Not since this nutbag
missed his timeline.

03:03.863 --> 03:05.579
Interval.

03:05.615 --> 03:06.780
With a serial killer,

03:06.832 --> 03:08.699
the time between murders
is an interval.

03:08.751 --> 03:10.451
What?
What difference does it make?

03:10.503 --> 03:12.169
All this guilt
that you're feeling...

03:12.205 --> 03:13.587
you gotta know there's nothing

03:13.623 --> 03:15.372
you nor I could've done here.

03:15.424 --> 03:16.790
Booth, I appreciate
your trying to help,

03:16.842 --> 03:18.125
but you should know
that your words

03:18.177 --> 03:19.877
are having the opposite effect.

03:19.929 --> 03:21.345
I promise,

03:21.380 --> 03:23.013
I will sleep when this is over.

03:36.362 --> 03:38.862
The body was found
by a demolition crew.

03:38.898 --> 03:40.814
Apparently, the whole
building's being torn down

03:40.816 --> 03:42.199
and turned into
a charter school

03:42.235 --> 03:44.151
focused on math and science.

03:44.153 --> 03:45.319
Oh, did you hear that? They're
turning it into a squint school.

03:45.321 --> 03:46.453
That's good, right?

03:46.489 --> 03:47.621
Yes. Excellent news.

03:47.657 --> 03:49.039
Perhaps someday,
the United States

03:49.075 --> 03:51.408
can surpass Estonia
in math and science.

03:51.460 --> 03:53.127
Oh. So still not sleeping, huh?

03:53.162 --> 03:55.496
Where is Dr. Hodgins?

03:55.498 --> 03:57.331
Has he already started
on the remains?

03:57.333 --> 03:59.917
No. The tissue is so thoroughly
desiccated, there's almost no

03:59.969 --> 04:02.836
insect activity, so I figured
I'd let him sit this one out.

04:02.888 --> 04:04.004
That's too bad.

04:04.006 --> 04:05.055
I was really
hoping to see him.

04:05.091 --> 04:06.340
I heard that he actually got

04:06.392 --> 04:07.641
some feeling back in his legs.

04:07.677 --> 04:08.676
He has.

04:08.678 --> 04:10.177
Unfortunately, that feeling

04:10.229 --> 04:11.845
isn't an altogether
pleasant one.

04:11.847 --> 04:13.514
Okay, take her up.
Let's go.

04:21.357 --> 04:25.192
It's odd that
this body was left here.

04:25.194 --> 04:27.861
The previous two victims were
found in national parks.

04:27.863 --> 04:30.164
Which means our killer has
altered his method of disposal.

04:30.199 --> 04:32.199
Okay, look, maybe this isn't

04:32.201 --> 04:33.917
the Puppeteer or whatever it is
you want to call him.

04:33.953 --> 04:35.953
Oh, it's him, Seeley.
Trust me.

04:36.005 --> 04:38.539
Also, if we're voting on names,

04:38.541 --> 04:40.174
I like Puppito,
the little puppet.

04:40.209 --> 04:42.126
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa?
Puppito?

04:42.178 --> 04:43.594
That moniker
doesn't make any sense.

04:43.629 --> 04:45.296
It doesn't elicit any fear.

04:45.348 --> 04:46.547
Well, I'm with Cam on this one.

04:46.599 --> 04:47.931
New rule:
serial killers don't get

04:47.967 --> 04:49.883
cool or frightening nicknames.

04:49.885 --> 04:52.102
No matter how
terrifying they are.

04:54.223 --> 04:56.640
Talk about a classroom
from hell, huh?

04:56.692 --> 04:59.810
Well, you'll note all
the adipose was removed

04:59.862 --> 05:02.696
and the skin was put
through a tanning process.

05:02.732 --> 05:04.231
My best estimate is

05:04.233 --> 05:06.700
Puppito lived with the body
at least six months.

05:06.736 --> 05:08.786
So in other words, this one
is just like the others.

05:08.821 --> 05:12.239
Small, non-projecting mastoid,

05:12.291 --> 05:14.241
sharp supraorbital margin...

05:14.243 --> 05:17.378
The victim was
a Caucasian female.

05:17.413 --> 05:19.046
What about the trauma
to the face?

05:19.081 --> 05:21.131
The same as before.

05:21.167 --> 05:22.583
The damage is postmortem,

05:22.635 --> 05:24.752
inflicted by
a right-handed assailant.

05:24.754 --> 05:26.086
Oh.

05:26.138 --> 05:27.388
What have you got?

05:27.423 --> 05:28.722
Nothing new.

05:28.758 --> 05:30.090
Just a Bible in the drawer
and a mix tape.

05:30.092 --> 05:31.642
Which means he's following

05:31.677 --> 05:32.960
the exact same ritual.

05:32.995 --> 05:34.895
No, this one is different.

05:34.930 --> 05:37.331
Why? Just because
this is a classroom setting?

05:37.366 --> 05:38.932
Also, look at
the victim's clothes.

05:38.984 --> 05:40.517
The ensemble is much more

05:40.569 --> 05:41.985
contemporary than the last one.

05:42.021 --> 05:43.687
The blouse, the pants...

05:43.739 --> 05:45.439
they're made by
a modern designer

05:45.441 --> 05:46.740
using only
sustainable materials.

05:46.776 --> 05:48.108
Are you sure?

05:48.110 --> 05:49.276
I mean, how could you
possibly know that?

05:49.311 --> 05:50.361
You didn't even look
at the label.

05:50.413 --> 05:52.663
I used to own a similar outfit.

05:52.698 --> 05:54.114
Wait, what do you mean, used to?

05:54.166 --> 05:55.616
I donated it...
to the thrift store

05:55.618 --> 05:57.668
at the Women's Mission Center.

05:59.422 --> 06:00.838
What is it?

06:02.958 --> 06:05.959
It's a sales tag from
the Women's Mission Center.

06:08.597 --> 06:10.514
These are your clothes, Bones.

06:10.549 --> 06:12.182
The victim is meant to be you.

06:14.453 --> 06:18.453

06:47.092 --> 06:48.925
The victim suffered
perimortem fractures

06:48.977 --> 06:50.427
of the left and right ulnae,

06:50.429 --> 06:52.479
also the right triquetral
and hamate.

06:52.514 --> 06:53.763
Defensive fractures.

06:53.815 --> 06:55.598
She went out with a fight.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.816
What about Dr. Brennan? Do you
want me to e-mail her the X rays

06:56.852 --> 06:58.318
or should we let her sleep?

06:58.353 --> 07:01.104
E-mail her.
Trust me, she's not sleeping.

07:01.106 --> 07:03.323
I'm seeing soil deposits
here, on the shoes.

07:03.358 --> 07:04.936
I'm gonna analyze that
as quickly as I can.

07:04.960 --> 07:05.943
I don't understand.

07:05.944 --> 07:07.010
I thought you said that
Dr. Brennan went home

07:07.045 --> 07:08.945
after her initial
examination.

07:08.947 --> 07:10.330
Oh, she did, but not to sleep.

07:10.365 --> 07:12.165
Given the circumstances,
she wanted to make sure

07:12.200 --> 07:13.500
Hank and Christine were safe.

07:13.535 --> 07:15.251
I gotta say, I can't blame her.

07:15.287 --> 07:16.786
I mean, this is
creepy to the power of ten,

07:16.788 --> 07:19.622
this killer just targeting her.

07:19.624 --> 07:21.374
I agree, but she still has
to take care of herself.

07:21.426 --> 07:24.461
If she's not healthy,
she's no good to anyone.

07:24.463 --> 07:25.845
Speaking of which,

07:25.881 --> 07:27.047
how are you doing?

07:27.099 --> 07:29.382
Me? No, fine, yeah.
Never better.

07:29.434 --> 07:30.633
Hodgins, come on.

07:30.686 --> 07:32.135
You're wearing the headband

07:32.137 --> 07:33.353
because you're perspiring
from the pain.

07:33.388 --> 07:35.188
No. It's a fashion statement.

07:35.223 --> 07:37.307
No, you look like
a young Bill Walton.

07:37.359 --> 07:39.309
No one wants to look
like Bill Walton.

07:39.361 --> 07:40.977
Fine.

07:40.979 --> 07:43.363
Look, I'm experiencing
some minor discomfort.

07:43.398 --> 07:44.698
But I'm telling you

07:44.733 --> 07:46.149
that this is actually
a good thing.

07:46.151 --> 07:47.650
My doctor said
that neuropathic pain

07:47.703 --> 07:50.987
is just, you know,
a common thing during recovery.

07:50.989 --> 07:53.323
And what does your doctor say
about pain management?

07:53.325 --> 07:54.708
That as long as I don't have
to talk about it,

07:54.743 --> 07:55.992
it'll be fine.

07:55.994 --> 07:57.544
Okay.

07:57.579 --> 07:58.995
I guess I'll get started
on a tox screen.

07:58.997 --> 08:00.497
Also...

08:00.549 --> 08:02.916
it's strange, but I found
quite a few loose hairs

08:02.968 --> 08:04.434
that appear to have been cut
postmortem.

08:04.469 --> 08:06.002
Huh.

08:06.004 --> 08:08.221
You know what I think?

08:08.256 --> 08:10.306
The killer was grooming her.

08:11.393 --> 08:12.425
Look. I ran my
facial reconstruction

08:12.477 --> 08:15.011
through missing persons
and got a match.

08:15.047 --> 08:16.730
Melissa Goodman.

08:16.765 --> 08:18.014
No, I see what you're saying.

08:18.066 --> 08:19.232
Her hair was considerably longer

08:19.267 --> 08:20.984
before she
was abducted.

08:21.019 --> 08:23.339
Yeah. And look at the way
the killer styled it.

08:24.272 --> 08:25.839
Does it remind you
of anyone we know?

08:29.611 --> 08:32.212
He made her look
just like Dr. Brennan.

08:37.486 --> 08:38.868
If you come up with anything,
just let me know, all right?

08:38.870 --> 08:40.203
Thanks.
You got something?

08:40.255 --> 08:41.871
Ah, I just got off the phone

08:41.923 --> 08:44.591
with the thrift store where
Bones donated all her clothes

08:44.626 --> 08:46.259
and no one remembers
who purchased them.

08:46.294 --> 08:47.544
Well, any cameras
in the store?

08:47.546 --> 08:48.962
Sales receipts?
Nothing.

08:49.014 --> 08:50.680
How about you?
What did you come up with?

08:50.715 --> 08:52.599
Well, I listened to the mix tape
that you found at the scene.

08:52.634 --> 08:54.434
It's the same as the last one:
all childhood favorites.

08:54.469 --> 08:57.554
"Buffalo Gals," "A Tisket,
A Tasket," "Frère Jacques"...

08:57.556 --> 08:58.888
Send that over to Angela.

08:58.890 --> 09:00.723
See if she can pick it apart.

09:00.725 --> 09:02.692
Will do, but I'm also going
to do some digging of my own.

09:02.727 --> 09:04.644
There's something familiar
about these songs.

09:04.696 --> 09:06.946
I just can't figure out what it is.
What about her husband?

09:06.982 --> 09:08.398
Well, he should be here shortly.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.899
It turns out he and Melissa
were separated

09:09.951 --> 09:11.901
at the time she went missing.
Does he have a record?

09:11.903 --> 09:14.537
Him? Nothing so far,
but I'll keep digging.

09:14.573 --> 09:15.905
You take a look
at the victim's file?

09:15.907 --> 09:16.907
Oh, I sure did.

09:16.958 --> 09:18.074
You're gonna like this one.

09:18.076 --> 09:19.742
Two DUIs,
drunk and disorderly.

09:19.795 --> 09:20.994
She was also fired

09:21.046 --> 09:22.912
from her last job
for embezzlement.

09:22.914 --> 09:26.633
So not a pillar of the community
like the others.

09:26.668 --> 09:28.251
Which means he picked her
because he needed

09:28.253 --> 09:30.086
a surrogate for Dr. Brennan.

09:30.088 --> 09:32.305
Yep. That's right.

09:32.340 --> 09:33.756
Here she is.

09:36.178 --> 09:37.644
Tempe, relax.

09:37.679 --> 09:39.429
I'm gonna take great
care of the kids.

09:39.431 --> 09:41.731
You have nothing to worry about.
Nothing to worry about?

09:41.766 --> 09:43.705
Dad, I swear, if anything
happens to either one of them...

09:43.729 --> 09:44.768
Hey.

09:44.769 --> 09:46.102
Nothing will happen to them.

09:46.104 --> 09:47.437
Hey, talk to me.

09:47.489 --> 09:48.771
I've never seen you
so frightened,

09:48.773 --> 09:50.607
not even when
we were on the run.

09:50.609 --> 09:51.941
Well, if it's all the same,

09:51.993 --> 09:54.077
I'd rather not talk about it.

09:54.112 --> 09:55.612
Oh, okay.
Tough beans.

09:55.647 --> 09:57.330
Tough beans? Tough beans?

09:57.365 --> 09:59.532
That's the best, most cogent
argument you have for me?

09:59.584 --> 10:00.834
Well, it worked
when you were a kid.

10:00.869 --> 10:02.535
I would say "tough
beans," and, uh...

10:02.587 --> 10:03.786
the argument
was over.

10:03.839 --> 10:06.289
I remember.

10:07.843 --> 10:09.609
I'm your dad.

10:09.644 --> 10:12.345
You-you can talk
to me about anything.

10:18.520 --> 10:21.137
Uh...

10:21.189 --> 10:23.106
Honestly, it's probably
just a symptom

10:23.141 --> 10:26.643
of being sleep deprived...

10:28.230 --> 10:30.280
...but I started feeling

10:30.315 --> 10:32.532
like I was being watched.

10:32.567 --> 10:36.669
At the lab, in my car,
even at home.

10:36.705 --> 10:38.488
I'm...

10:38.490 --> 10:40.123
I know it's illogical

10:40.158 --> 10:41.875
and I have no
empirical evidence.

10:41.910 --> 10:43.326
Forget evidence.

10:43.328 --> 10:45.662
Well, that's not
your nature, but...

10:45.714 --> 10:47.197
but be careful.

10:47.232 --> 10:49.499
Please.

10:59.010 --> 11:01.010
Mr. Goodman.

11:01.062 --> 11:03.096
You doing okay?

11:03.148 --> 11:04.514
Seem a tad bit nervous.

11:04.566 --> 11:05.932
I-I'm fine, I just...

11:05.984 --> 11:07.267
didn't think we'd
be meeting in here.

11:07.319 --> 11:08.651
Sorry about that.

11:08.687 --> 11:09.852
Conference room was booked.

11:09.905 --> 11:12.572
So, you want to tell us
about your wife

11:12.607 --> 11:14.357
Melissa.

11:15.594 --> 11:17.277
Look...

11:17.329 --> 11:19.712
our relationship
was complicated.

11:19.748 --> 11:21.514
Melissa had
difficulties with alcohol.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.750
That must be your excuse
for beating her.

11:23.785 --> 11:26.703
- No. No, I didn't.
- Really?

11:26.738 --> 11:29.539
'Cause I dug up a police report
from about a year ago

11:29.591 --> 11:30.873
that suggests otherwise.

11:30.926 --> 11:33.042
No, what happened
was Melissa was drunk.

11:33.044 --> 11:35.545
She slipped and hit her head.
Look at the report.

11:35.547 --> 11:38.047
Well, assume for a second
that we believe you,

11:38.049 --> 11:40.133
you think of anyone else
who'd want to harm her?

11:40.185 --> 11:43.019
I don't because we weren't...

11:43.054 --> 11:44.804
we weren't even talking
when she went missing.

11:44.856 --> 11:47.390
Her therapist thought it'd
be best if we took a time out.

11:47.392 --> 11:48.691
Her therapist.

11:48.727 --> 11:50.043
Psychologist.

11:50.078 --> 11:52.145
His name is Dr. Brandon Faulk.

11:52.197 --> 11:53.730
I take it he was treating her
for alcoholism?

11:53.782 --> 11:56.199
Initially, yes, and then...

11:56.234 --> 11:57.450
something happened.

11:57.485 --> 11:59.202
She started to develop
new symptoms.

11:59.237 --> 12:02.822
She'd wake up in the middle
of the night screaming.

12:02.874 --> 12:05.375
Wait a second, you're saying
she was having nightmares?

12:05.410 --> 12:07.427
About what?

12:08.580 --> 12:10.246
I don't know.

12:17.505 --> 12:19.222
Oh, my God.

12:19.257 --> 12:21.007
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:21.059 --> 12:24.260
Angie, I'm just having some
involuntary contractions here.

12:24.262 --> 12:25.845
Okay, uh, uh, here.

12:25.897 --> 12:27.146
Just, um...

12:27.182 --> 12:28.898
I-I-I picked up your medication.

12:28.933 --> 12:30.383
I have some Valium.

12:30.418 --> 12:32.118
No, no, no, wait.
It's okay, it's okay.

12:32.153 --> 12:33.786
It's passing, it's passing,
keep it for later.

12:33.822 --> 12:34.937
Are you sure?

12:34.939 --> 12:37.073
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.

12:37.108 --> 12:38.524
I'm good.

12:38.576 --> 12:39.776
Everything's good.

12:44.282 --> 12:45.448
Thanks, Angie.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.583
Yeah.

12:47.619 --> 12:49.118
I'm gonna clean this up, um...

12:49.120 --> 12:51.504
first let me show you
what I was working on here.

12:51.539 --> 12:52.755
Look at this.

12:52.791 --> 12:54.791
I, uh...
I found this food remnants

12:54.843 --> 12:56.542
between the victim's teeth.

12:56.594 --> 12:57.794
See this?

12:57.796 --> 12:59.379
Um... let me guess,

12:59.431 --> 13:02.465
this is the same gruel
that he fed to the others?

13:02.517 --> 13:03.933
No, this is seitan.

13:03.968 --> 13:05.551
It's a-it's a food
made from gluten,

13:05.603 --> 13:07.637
which is the main ingredient
in wheat.

13:07.689 --> 13:09.972
This particular piece,
it was drenched in,

13:10.025 --> 13:11.641
like, a piccata sauce.

13:11.643 --> 13:13.026
You know, lemon juice,
capers, shallots.

13:13.061 --> 13:14.310
Wait a-wait a second.

13:14.312 --> 13:15.912
Seitan with piccata?

13:15.947 --> 13:18.731
That's... that's one of
Brennan's favorite meals.

13:18.783 --> 13:20.650
But... how could he know
that, unless that he's...

13:20.652 --> 13:22.485
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
before you get ahead of yourself,

13:22.537 --> 13:24.037
let me show you
what else I found.

13:24.072 --> 13:25.655
See this here?

13:25.707 --> 13:28.875
This is actually the soil that
I found on the victim's shoes.

13:28.910 --> 13:31.327
Now, it's got a very high
salt content,

13:31.363 --> 13:33.463
which means that it's probably
from a brackish region,

13:33.498 --> 13:36.416
but I also found disinfectant
underneath the soil.

13:36.468 --> 13:38.835
Okay, I'm nodding here and just
pretending like I have some idea

13:38.887 --> 13:40.553
what you're talking about.
Angela,

13:40.588 --> 13:44.390
I think that the killer
actually wiped the shoes clean

13:44.426 --> 13:46.059
before muddying them.

13:46.094 --> 13:47.677
I mean, think about it.

13:47.729 --> 13:49.345
We know that this guy's
got this, like,

13:49.397 --> 13:53.516
crazy genius IQ level and
he's manipulative as they come.

13:53.518 --> 13:56.035
So, it's possible that
he planted the evidence

13:56.071 --> 13:57.236
in order to mislead us?

13:57.272 --> 13:58.688
That's the problem.

13:58.740 --> 14:00.273
With this guy,

14:00.325 --> 14:02.358
we can't even trust
the evidence that we've got.

I am sorry to keep you both

14:47.731 --> 14:49.078
Usually when a patient calls,

14:49.102 --> 14:50.609
it's a matter
of some importance.

14:50.633 --> 14:51.335
Well, not a problem.

14:51.336 --> 14:53.203
Thanks for taking
the time to see us.

14:53.255 --> 14:55.455
Dr. Faulk, I must say
the decor here

14:55.507 --> 14:56.706
is unlike anything

14:56.708 --> 14:59.176
I've seen in a
psychologist's office.

14:59.211 --> 15:01.595
These firing neurons
are quite beautiful.

15:01.630 --> 15:03.380
Oh, I'm glad
you appreciate them.

15:03.432 --> 15:06.349
Neuroscience was what I got
my first doctorate in,

15:06.385 --> 15:07.884
so my tendencies

15:07.936 --> 15:09.803
are a bit more physiological

15:09.855 --> 15:11.021
than my colleagues.

15:11.056 --> 15:12.689
Please sit.

15:12.724 --> 15:15.225
I tend to view psychology
as something of a soft science.

15:15.277 --> 15:17.077
It's far too open
to interpretation,

15:17.112 --> 15:18.145
so in my practice,

15:18.197 --> 15:21.031
I do what I can to remedy that.

15:21.066 --> 15:23.550
I find your ambition
to be admirable.

15:23.585 --> 15:26.069
As, uh, as I said on the phone,

15:26.071 --> 15:28.738
I'm happy to do whatever
I can do to be of assistance,

15:28.790 --> 15:30.407
however, that said,

15:30.409 --> 15:33.243
I can't breach doctor-patient
confidentiality.

15:33.245 --> 15:36.563
What if I told you other
people's lives are at stake?

15:37.633 --> 15:39.733
I see. Well, uh...

15:39.768 --> 15:41.251
then, please, ask.

15:41.303 --> 15:42.886
I'll do what I can to answer.

15:42.921 --> 15:44.821
Let's start with
potential suspects.

15:44.857 --> 15:47.924
Melissa... did she ever mention
anyone who scared her?

15:47.926 --> 15:50.510
About a month prior
to Melissa's disappearance,

15:50.562 --> 15:54.447
she began exhibiting
symptoms of paranoia.

15:54.483 --> 15:57.851
She also began
experiencing nightmares,

15:57.903 --> 15:59.769
premonitions that
she was going to be killed.

15:59.771 --> 16:01.555
Premonitions?

16:01.590 --> 16:06.276
You believe that she was
foreseeing her own future?

16:06.278 --> 16:07.494
Uh, let me explain.

16:07.529 --> 16:08.945
In my studies, I have found

16:08.997 --> 16:10.413
that vivid and emotional dreams

16:10.449 --> 16:11.781
are linked to two parts
of the brain--

16:11.783 --> 16:13.583
the amygdala
and the hippocampus.

16:13.619 --> 16:15.585
The amygdala, we know,
controls emotional response.

16:15.621 --> 16:17.120
The hippo...

16:17.172 --> 16:18.672
The hippocampus
has been implicated

16:18.707 --> 16:20.457
in memory function.

16:21.710 --> 16:23.793
Well, in my opinion,

16:23.795 --> 16:26.463
nightmares are
a desperate attempt

16:26.515 --> 16:28.465
for memory and emotion

16:28.467 --> 16:31.501
to try to connect
with each another.

16:33.338 --> 16:35.472
Okay, look, so...

16:35.474 --> 16:37.390
...you're saying
that Melissa knew

16:37.442 --> 16:39.309
who her killer was

16:39.361 --> 16:42.062
and the answer
was in her dreams?

16:43.148 --> 16:44.864
Yeah.

16:48.036 --> 16:49.953
Results from the tox screen

16:49.988 --> 16:52.205
show traces of propofol
and Succinylcholine.

16:52.241 --> 16:53.990
So cause of death
was poisoning.

16:54.042 --> 16:56.376
Which means she was killed the
exact same way the others were.

16:56.411 --> 16:57.994
Not exactly.

16:57.996 --> 16:59.329
On the right hand, I found
longitudinal fractures

16:59.331 --> 17:00.547
of the second, third,

17:00.582 --> 17:02.465
and fourth
proximal phalanges.

17:02.501 --> 17:06.219
Also, take a look
at this direct fracture

17:06.255 --> 17:07.587
on the base
of the occipital.

17:07.638 --> 17:09.105
Wow, a blow there
would likely have

17:09.141 --> 17:10.807
rendered the victim unconscious.

17:10.842 --> 17:12.509
Taken as a whole,
the narrative of these injuries

17:12.511 --> 17:15.228
suggests the killer struggled
when abducting his victims.

17:15.263 --> 17:17.012
There's something else.

17:17.065 --> 17:18.515
The holes drilled
into the body

17:18.517 --> 17:20.567
correspond perfectly
with muscle attachments.

17:20.602 --> 17:23.653
I'm telling you,
this guy knows human anatomy.

17:27.693 --> 17:29.326
I knew it.

17:29.361 --> 17:30.801
Told you that music
sounded familiar.

17:30.829 --> 17:33.663
What is this?
Songbook published in 1978.

17:33.699 --> 17:35.031
In it-- every one of
the songs on the tape

17:35.083 --> 17:36.583
that the killer
left us, in order.

17:36.618 --> 17:38.285
There's no way that's
a coincidence.

17:38.337 --> 17:39.786
How many of these were published?
Just a couple thousand.

17:39.838 --> 17:41.421
Publisher out
of Michigan.

17:41.456 --> 17:43.039
Most of the sales were in-state.

17:43.091 --> 17:45.542
Oh. How'd you know about this?

17:45.594 --> 17:48.044
My good old Aunt Donna
in Lansing sent it to me.

17:48.096 --> 17:49.462
What can I say?

17:49.514 --> 17:51.014
I've been a singer
since the day I was born.

17:51.049 --> 17:52.716
Maybe you want me to bust out
a little a Capella

17:52.718 --> 17:54.217
to refresh your memory, there.

17:54.252 --> 17:56.219
That is okay.
I got enough horror in my life

17:56.221 --> 17:57.520
as it is.
Ouch.

17:57.556 --> 17:58.722
Wait a second.

17:58.724 --> 18:00.273
If this was
published in 1978,

18:00.309 --> 18:02.225
this helps narrow down
the age of the killer.

18:02.227 --> 18:04.694
Yep. Also tells us
where he likely grew up.

18:04.730 --> 18:05.779
All right.

18:05.814 --> 18:08.398
Do me a favor, will you?

18:08.450 --> 18:11.401
Hand me the, uh, Goodman file.

18:21.797 --> 18:23.246
Dr. Brennan.

18:23.298 --> 18:24.748
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to startle you.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.466
You look like you could
use a little caffeine.

18:26.501 --> 18:28.501
Thank you.

18:28.553 --> 18:30.086
If you don't mind, can I ask
what you're looking at?

18:30.122 --> 18:31.254
It's nothing.

18:31.306 --> 18:32.922
Past cases.

18:32.924 --> 18:34.341
Burn victims.

18:34.393 --> 18:37.727
For some reason...
I think it might be relevant.

18:37.763 --> 18:40.647
Okay, well, I'm going
to get back to the bones.

18:40.682 --> 18:42.202
Let me know
if you need anything, okay?

18:42.234 --> 18:43.733
I will, thank you.

18:52.194 --> 18:53.910
Wha...?

18:55.330 --> 18:57.330
Hello?

18:58.834 --> 19:01.534
Mr. Bray?

19:05.457 --> 19:08.091
Mr. Bray?

19:16.017 --> 19:18.134
Dr. Hodgins?

19:32.517 --> 19:33.867
Angela, are y...

19:33.902 --> 19:36.035
Dr. Saroyan?

19:45.497 --> 19:47.380
Hello? Who...

19:47.416 --> 19:49.215
Whoever you are, I can hear you.

19:54.589 --> 19:56.840
Please, I must ask you
to stop where you are,

19:56.892 --> 19:58.658
and identify yourself.

20:05.517 --> 20:07.350
Whoever you are,

20:07.402 --> 20:10.520
I-I must warn you,
I'm holding hydrochloric acid.

20:10.572 --> 20:12.322
I-if you value your life,

20:12.357 --> 20:14.858
or at a-a minimum,
your appearance,

20:14.910 --> 20:18.027
I advise you to stop advancing.

20:21.583 --> 20:23.416
Well, that's what I figured.

20:42.220 --> 20:43.553
Dr. Brennan?

20:43.555 --> 20:44.521
A-are you okay?

20:44.556 --> 20:45.605
I heard you call out.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.390
Yes, I'm fine.

20:47.442 --> 20:48.892
Nothing to worry about.

20:48.894 --> 20:50.610
Everything's going to be okay,
Dr. Brennan.

20:50.645 --> 20:52.562
You'll figure it out.

20:52.614 --> 20:54.898
And...

20:54.900 --> 20:56.399
if you knew what I knew,

20:58.820 --> 21:01.120
you'd be so proud of me.

21:05.577 --> 21:07.293
Tempe.

21:07.329 --> 21:09.412
Tempe, what's the matter?

21:09.414 --> 21:11.331
Hey, whoa, it's Dad, it's Dad.

21:11.383 --> 21:12.715
It's going to be all right.

21:12.751 --> 21:14.551
It'll be all right, all right.

21:14.586 --> 21:16.586
Dad...

21:16.638 --> 21:18.671
I need help.

21:18.723 --> 21:20.673
Oh...

21:22.977 --> 21:25.250
Oh, come on, Bones, don't you
even want to try to talk this out?

21:25.251 --> 21:27.357
No, why would I? You're not
an expert in this field.

21:27.457 --> 21:29.457
Field? In what field,
listening to you?

21:29.509 --> 21:31.676
'Cause trust me,
no one has logged more hours.

21:31.712 --> 21:33.128
Okay, you know what?
I'm coming with you.

21:33.180 --> 21:34.879
No, Booth,
I am a full-grown adult.

21:34.881 --> 21:36.181
I don't need you to babysit me.

21:36.216 --> 21:37.966
Okay, all I'm asking,

21:38.018 --> 21:39.100
is that you keep
your phone on you

21:39.136 --> 21:40.385
so I can reach you
at any time.

21:40.437 --> 21:42.721
My father will be back shortly,

21:42.723 --> 21:44.356
when he is,
you can leave for work.

21:44.391 --> 21:46.608
Bones,
why are you even doing this?

21:46.643 --> 21:48.560
You don't even
believe in psychology.

21:48.562 --> 21:50.395
You're right. I don't.

21:52.399 --> 21:54.949
That should tell you
exactly how desperate I am.

22:13.086 --> 22:16.054
Let me explain
how this works.

22:17.507 --> 22:19.808
Nightmares are, essentially,

22:19.843 --> 22:21.343
a safe way to process threats

22:21.395 --> 22:23.645
stored in our
autobiographical memories.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.765
Now, my goal...

22:27.651 --> 22:30.435
...is to help you figure out

22:30.470 --> 22:33.872
what it is in your past
that's threatening you.

22:33.907 --> 22:37.575
And to, presumably,
do so <i>before</i> I am murdered.

22:38.779 --> 22:42.914
Like what happened
to your previous client.

22:45.669 --> 22:47.669
Dr. Brennan...

22:47.704 --> 22:49.120
if you'd like to consult
with someone else...

22:49.172 --> 22:50.772
No.

22:50.807 --> 22:52.807
I am willing to do

22:52.843 --> 22:56.428
whatever is necessary
to make this stop.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.417
How would you like me to begin?

23:03.854 --> 23:05.937
When a body is
brought into your lab,

23:05.972 --> 23:08.973
how do you begin
to catalogue the injuries?

23:08.975 --> 23:11.659
I'm not sure I understand,
uh, but, um,

23:11.695 --> 23:14.479
with skeletal remains, I...

23:14.531 --> 23:17.549
I typically begin with trauma

23:17.584 --> 23:20.301
that is most readily apparent.

23:20.337 --> 23:21.986
Good.

23:26.076 --> 23:27.659
Let's close our eyes.

23:32.949 --> 23:36.301
Now I want you
to try to visualize

23:36.336 --> 23:39.671
your autobiographical timeline
as a set of remains.

23:41.391 --> 23:43.508
What trauma do you see

23:43.560 --> 23:46.511
that's most readily apparent?

23:50.016 --> 23:54.686
My mother and my father
abandoning me...

24:00.193 --> 24:03.928
...and my mother's
subsequent murder.

24:04.865 --> 24:07.198
Tell me more about your mother.

24:07.250 --> 24:09.584
What was her name?

24:17.861 --> 24:19.461
<i>Chapter seven.</i>

24:19.513 --> 24:21.513
<i>I can't believe how good</i>
<i>of a reader you are.</i>

24:21.548 --> 24:22.714
Okay, here we go.

24:22.716 --> 24:25.467
"There was a table
set out under a tree

24:25.519 --> 24:28.853
"in front of the house,
and the March Hare and

24:28.889 --> 24:30.388
the Hatter were
having tea at it."

24:30.440 --> 24:32.023
Yes.

24:32.058 --> 24:35.276
Sorry to break up the tea party,
but Hank's asleep.

24:35.312 --> 24:36.895
That means Daddy's
got to get to work.

24:36.897 --> 24:38.646
You go put your shoes on, okay?
All right.

24:38.698 --> 24:40.865
Can I talk to you?
Yeah.

24:44.070 --> 24:45.620
I'm worried about Tempe.

24:45.655 --> 24:47.572
Look, so am I.

24:47.574 --> 24:49.874
Listen, this therapist that
she's seeing, seems to think

24:49.910 --> 24:52.143
that her past has to do
with her nightmares,

24:52.179 --> 24:53.745
which means I need you
to come clean with me.

24:53.797 --> 24:55.330
About what?

24:55.382 --> 24:56.881
Everything, every-every robbery,

24:56.917 --> 24:58.299
every crook that you
double-crossed, every murder,

24:58.335 --> 24:59.855
anyone who could be
coming after Bones.

24:59.886 --> 25:01.419
Booth, we've been
through all this.

25:01.471 --> 25:03.721
I have no more secrets
left to hide.

25:07.427 --> 25:08.760
What is it, Aubrey?

25:08.762 --> 25:09.928
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

25:09.930 --> 25:10.930
I got a potential

25:10.981 --> 25:11.930
suspect for you.

25:11.982 --> 25:13.515
His name is Graham Reynolds.

25:13.567 --> 25:16.150
He's a puppeteer who has a store
in West Point, Virginia.

25:16.186 --> 25:17.769
A city which,
according to Hodgins,

25:17.771 --> 25:19.404
is known for its brackish soil.

25:19.439 --> 25:21.272
The same soil we found
on the victim's shoe?

25:21.324 --> 25:22.774
The reason that
Reynolds didn't pop up

25:22.826 --> 25:24.108
on our radar is because

25:24.160 --> 25:25.610
he just now re-opened his shop.
It had been shut

25:25.612 --> 25:26.778
down while he was in prison.

25:26.830 --> 25:27.612
What were the charges?

25:27.614 --> 25:28.830
Attempted murder.

25:28.865 --> 25:30.281
The guy did two years in Sussex.

25:30.283 --> 25:31.916
Good work, just text me
the location.

25:31.952 --> 25:33.334
I'll meet you there.
Listen, Max...

25:33.370 --> 25:34.452
Daddy, please,
don't leave.

25:34.504 --> 25:35.870
Hey, hi.

25:35.922 --> 25:37.755
Okay, listen, I am gonna
be back soon, okay?

25:37.791 --> 25:39.173
Hey.
I love you.

25:39.209 --> 25:40.792
I love you, too. Listen,
you stay here with Grandpa

25:40.844 --> 25:42.210
and I'll bring back
ice cream, okay? Kiss.

25:42.262 --> 25:43.177
All right.

25:43.213 --> 25:44.262
Go with your grandpa.

25:44.297 --> 25:45.630
Go ahead.

26:01.781 --> 26:02.697
Booth.

26:02.732 --> 26:03.982
Yeah?

26:03.984 --> 26:05.283
Right this way.

26:05.318 --> 26:07.201
Oh...

26:07.237 --> 26:09.120
Okay, uh...

26:09.155 --> 26:11.956
Right this way.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.077
I'm afraid of clowns.

26:16.129 --> 26:17.912
Yeah, hi.

26:17.964 --> 26:18.913
Hello.

26:18.965 --> 26:19.998
How are you doing?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.833
Are you boys here
for the party?

26:21.835 --> 26:23.334
No, we're looking
for Graham Reynolds.

26:23.386 --> 26:24.502
Uh, is he around?

26:24.554 --> 26:26.554
Are you, like, talent scouts?

26:26.590 --> 26:29.007
Sure, sounds about right.

26:29.059 --> 26:30.541
Mm, I thought so.

26:30.577 --> 26:32.226
If you like, you can peek

26:32.262 --> 26:34.512
your head inside,
catch the end of the show.

26:34.514 --> 26:38.983
All I ask is that
you don't talk.

26:39.019 --> 26:40.685
It ruins the whole experience.

26:40.737 --> 26:42.687
Right.

26:42.689 --> 26:44.689
Okay, well...

26:48.862 --> 26:50.662
Come here, come, come,
come, come here. Come here.

26:50.697 --> 26:52.530
- Ah, no! No, no, no.
- Small crowd.

26:52.582 --> 26:53.948
I guess
the word got out

26:54.000 --> 26:55.700
that our puppet
master was a felon.

26:55.752 --> 26:57.368
Booth, shh.

26:57.420 --> 26:59.704
You're ruining
the experience.

26:59.706 --> 27:01.205
Stop, you tell me.

27:01.207 --> 27:03.424
What did you do
with the babysitter?

27:03.460 --> 27:04.592
You want to know

27:04.628 --> 27:05.960
what I did with the babysitter?

27:06.012 --> 27:09.631
Well... first, I did
a little of this!

27:09.666 --> 27:12.100
And then I did some of this!

27:12.135 --> 27:13.217
And then this!

27:13.219 --> 27:14.686
What the hell am
I watching here?

27:14.721 --> 27:15.803
It looks like his take on

27:15.855 --> 27:16.888
<i>Punch and Judy.</i>

27:16.890 --> 27:18.072
It's a puppet show
from the old days,

27:18.108 --> 27:19.108
like a...

27:19.142 --> 27:20.191
Itchy and Scratchy

27:20.226 --> 27:21.359
from the Victorian era.

27:21.394 --> 27:23.728
Oh, no, is she dead?

27:23.780 --> 27:25.063
I don't know.

27:26.616 --> 27:28.533
It appears that she is dead.

27:28.568 --> 27:29.984
Oh, well.

27:30.036 --> 27:31.903
Happy birthday!

27:37.243 --> 27:39.243
Thank you.

27:39.245 --> 27:41.079
Thank you so much.

27:42.082 --> 27:44.999
It is so good to be back.

27:49.389 --> 27:52.256
And for those of you
who would like to learn more

27:52.308 --> 27:55.226
about puppeteering,
please stay in your seats.

27:55.261 --> 28:00.331
I just need to take a quick
recess and I will be right back.

28:00.367 --> 28:03.184
Thank you. Thank you.

28:03.236 --> 28:04.268
Okay, it looks like
he made us, huh?

28:04.320 --> 28:06.821
So much for being
talent scouts.

29:01.544 --> 29:04.712
Whoa. Okay.

29:39.532 --> 29:42.700
Um... Booth.

29:42.702 --> 29:44.535
Yeah?

29:44.537 --> 29:48.039
I've got something over here I
think you're gonna want to see.

29:59.102 --> 30:01.435
Booth, you all right?

30:03.973 --> 30:05.690
You see him?

30:07.060 --> 30:10.111
No, it looks like
he went out the window.

30:18.071 --> 30:19.487
All right, right there.

30:19.539 --> 30:21.239
Let's go, happy puppet boy.

30:21.241 --> 30:22.456
Come on.

30:22.492 --> 30:23.991
Sit down.

30:24.043 --> 30:25.409
Or at least

30:25.411 --> 30:26.794
he wanted me to think
he went through the window.

30:26.830 --> 30:29.046
Drop the hammer.
Drop it.

30:55.009 --> 30:56.475
Hey, Cam just called.

30:56.510 --> 30:57.593
In Reynolds's basement,

30:57.645 --> 30:59.511
she found blood in the drain.

30:59.513 --> 31:00.513
What do you got?

31:00.564 --> 31:01.513
I got Reynolds's files.

31:01.515 --> 31:02.731
His, uh, psych report

31:02.766 --> 31:04.816
from the prison
and his bank statements.

31:04.852 --> 31:05.968
Anything good?

31:06.003 --> 31:07.686
No.

31:07.688 --> 31:09.738
He didn't do it.

31:13.777 --> 31:15.077
Hello.

31:15.112 --> 31:16.945
How are you?

31:16.997 --> 31:18.614
Hi, Mr. Bunny.

31:19.833 --> 31:22.250
...four, five, six, seven...

31:24.204 --> 31:25.871
12 little bunnies.

31:25.923 --> 31:27.105
You can stop with that.

31:27.141 --> 31:28.373
Mr. Reynolds,

31:28.425 --> 31:29.841
I need to ask you
some questions.

31:29.877 --> 31:31.343
Let's start with the guy

31:31.378 --> 31:33.762
who was subletting your basement
for the past year.

31:33.797 --> 31:37.299
I don't know what you mean.

31:37.351 --> 31:38.684
Okay,

31:38.719 --> 31:40.268
let me introduce you
to a friend of mine.

31:40.304 --> 31:41.770
His name is George Gibbons.

31:41.805 --> 31:43.055
He kind of reminds me of you.

31:43.057 --> 31:44.806
High school drop out,

31:44.858 --> 31:46.358
criminal record, expendable.

31:50.197 --> 31:51.647
Look, the guy

31:51.699 --> 31:53.782
who rented your basement,
he lied to you.

31:53.817 --> 31:55.067
I need a name.

31:55.069 --> 31:56.485
I don't know his name.

31:56.537 --> 31:57.402
But he paid you.

31:57.454 --> 31:59.404
Yeah, I needed money
to open my shop.

31:59.406 --> 32:00.989
The banks all
laughed at me.

32:01.041 --> 32:02.324
How did he pay you?
Cash.

32:02.376 --> 32:03.458
He left it on my workbench

32:03.494 --> 32:04.710
at the first of every month.

32:04.745 --> 32:06.962
I need to know
what he looks like.

32:06.997 --> 32:08.797
I don't know.

32:08.832 --> 32:09.965
You're scared, aren't you?

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
You saw him.

32:11.051 --> 32:12.334
I s-s... once.

32:12.386 --> 32:14.970
I-I-I was curious
and I shouldn't have.

32:15.005 --> 32:16.838
What did he look like?
I didn't-I didn't-I...

32:16.890 --> 32:18.006
What did he look like?

32:18.058 --> 32:19.558
I couldn't see his face.

32:19.593 --> 32:20.842
It was too dark.

32:20.894 --> 32:22.060
He was wearing

32:22.096 --> 32:23.178
a sweatshirt with, um,

32:23.230 --> 32:25.013
a-a hood on it and he had...

32:25.065 --> 32:26.014
he had gloves.

32:26.066 --> 32:27.566
What else?

32:27.601 --> 32:28.817
I don't know.

32:28.852 --> 32:30.402
I didn't see anything else,
I swear.

32:30.437 --> 32:31.737
I don't know who he is.

32:31.772 --> 32:33.155
I don't.

32:55.262 --> 32:58.296
Okay, let's go back
to the beginning.

32:58.348 --> 33:00.716
The first victim, Douglas Burkhart.
No.

33:00.751 --> 33:03.385
The first two murders
make sense, all right?

33:03.437 --> 33:05.187
The problem is
the most recent victim.

33:05.222 --> 33:07.305
Melissa Goodman.
She doesn't fit the profile.

33:07.357 --> 33:09.274
Exactly, so why is
he going after her?

33:10.911 --> 33:12.360
I don't know.

33:12.396 --> 33:13.979
Maybe he just needed
someone that he could

33:14.031 --> 33:15.280
dress up like Dr. Brennan.

33:15.315 --> 33:16.648
I don't know.

33:16.650 --> 33:18.316
It's got to be something else.
Okay,

33:18.368 --> 33:19.568
so, uh, in the-in the basement,

33:19.620 --> 33:21.069
there were the photos
of all of us.

33:21.121 --> 33:22.654
No, no, I'm not
buying that, all right?

33:22.706 --> 33:24.656
The photos,
they're just a smokescreen.

33:24.658 --> 33:25.991
Well, I agree.

33:26.043 --> 33:27.159
Everything else points
to Dr. Brennan.

33:27.211 --> 33:28.577
The way the victim
was clothed.

33:28.629 --> 33:29.878
The way her hair was cut.

33:29.913 --> 33:31.713
The question is,
how does killing Melissa

33:31.749 --> 33:32.714
get him closer to Bones?

33:32.750 --> 33:34.249
Well, it doesn't.

33:34.301 --> 33:36.835
If anything, Dr. Brennan
is more vigilant now than ever.

33:36.837 --> 33:38.220
Even as we speak,
she's getting help

33:38.255 --> 33:40.589
so we can find this guy.

33:40.641 --> 33:43.341
Wait a second.

33:47.264 --> 33:49.314
That's it.

33:50.150 --> 33:51.233
Bones is getting help

33:51.268 --> 33:52.484
from Melissa's therapist
right now.

33:52.519 --> 33:53.602
Son of a bitch.

34:01.028 --> 34:03.695
Now keep your eyes closed.

34:10.754 --> 34:13.705
I invite you...

34:13.757 --> 34:16.507
to listen only to
the sound of my voice.

34:23.967 --> 34:28.270
I'd like you to return
to your dreams.

34:34.228 --> 34:36.444
Tell me what you see.

34:38.065 --> 34:38.864
I see a burned...

34:38.899 --> 34:41.233
<i>Caucasian male.</i>

34:41.235 --> 34:43.018
His face is like molten lava.

34:43.053 --> 34:44.569
You know him.

34:44.605 --> 34:45.871
No.

34:45.906 --> 34:47.405
<i>He's unrecognizable.</i>

34:47.456 --> 34:48.989
Look closer, here.

34:51.210 --> 34:52.409
But he's not dead.

34:53.964 --> 34:55.496
<i>He's bleeding.</i>

34:55.549 --> 34:58.300
He is your husband.

35:02.055 --> 35:03.638
No.

35:03.674 --> 35:06.174
Looks to me
like old wounds can cut deep.

35:06.226 --> 35:08.310
I-I don't want
to know who he is.

35:16.620 --> 35:18.236
You've moved on.

35:18.272 --> 35:19.404
Where are you?

35:25.112 --> 35:26.528
I'm in my office.

35:26.580 --> 35:28.780
The intern, is he there?

35:28.782 --> 35:31.333
Dr. Brennan,
are you okay?

35:31.368 --> 35:32.868
I heard you call out.

35:38.208 --> 35:39.791
His hands, they're burned.

35:39.843 --> 35:41.293
Like the other victim.

35:51.305 --> 35:54.389
He has a cigarette
tucked behind his ear.

35:54.441 --> 35:56.608
Everything's
gonna be okay, Dr. Brennan.

35:56.643 --> 35:58.059
You'll figure it out.

35:58.111 --> 35:59.694
It's an affectation of his.

35:59.730 --> 36:02.864
It's... something he used to do.

36:02.900 --> 36:04.616
When?

36:07.487 --> 36:08.904
I-I don't remember.

36:08.956 --> 36:10.572
If you knew what I knew,

36:10.624 --> 36:12.040
you'd be so proud.

36:12.075 --> 36:14.492
Dr. Brennan.

36:14.494 --> 36:15.877
Who is he? Who is he?

36:15.913 --> 36:17.212
<i>Who is he?</i>

36:18.665 --> 36:21.249
Who is he?!

36:21.301 --> 36:22.717
Who is he?

36:24.304 --> 36:26.755
<i>Who is he? Who is he?</i>

36:28.175 --> 36:30.342
Bones, get away from him.

36:30.344 --> 36:32.594
Booth, what-what-what's...
what are you doing?

36:32.646 --> 36:33.646
Move. Get away from him.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.397
Agent Booth,
what is happening?

36:35.432 --> 36:36.848
Put your hands behind your back.

36:36.850 --> 36:38.350
Do it.

36:38.402 --> 36:39.684
What?

36:40.654 --> 36:42.103
It's him, Bones.

36:42.155 --> 36:43.021
It's him.

36:43.023 --> 36:44.356
He did it.
He killed her

36:44.358 --> 36:46.858
to get to you.

36:48.538 --> 36:51.172
Look, all I'm saying, Bones,
is take a look at his file.

36:51.176 --> 36:52.342
His parents were murdered

36:52.394 --> 36:53.926
when he was seven-years-old.
What?

36:53.978 --> 36:55.511
You think that a first grader

36:55.563 --> 36:56.596
is capable of murder?

36:56.648 --> 36:58.181
I'm not saying he killed them.

36:58.233 --> 37:00.066
All I'm saying is that
their deaths fit the profile.

37:00.101 --> 37:02.151
Or it could simply
explain his profession.

37:02.187 --> 37:04.070
Often those who

37:04.105 --> 37:06.272
enter psychology do so

37:06.324 --> 37:07.774
because they have
suffered traumatic loss.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.192
You're defending him.

37:09.244 --> 37:10.860
No, I am merely pointing out
that you have no proof.

37:10.912 --> 37:11.861
Think about it.

37:11.913 --> 37:13.012
This guy is smart,

37:13.048 --> 37:14.330
he knows basic anatomy,

37:14.366 --> 37:15.448
and he is manipulative!

37:15.500 --> 37:17.083
Nothing you are saying is proof.

37:18.119 --> 37:19.585
He was trying to help.

37:19.621 --> 37:21.037
He was playing you.

37:21.039 --> 37:22.455
He was just trying
to get close you.

37:22.507 --> 37:23.840
I disagree.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.425
I am done arguing with you.

37:25.460 --> 37:26.793
If you think he's innocent,
go ahead and prove it.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.261
I will.
Until then, I am not

37:28.296 --> 37:30.046
letting this guy
out of my sight.

37:41.726 --> 37:42.775
Oh, hey, guys.

37:42.811 --> 37:43.943
Shh, it's Brennan.

37:43.978 --> 37:45.027
Hey.

37:45.063 --> 37:46.562
Hi, hello.

37:46.614 --> 37:48.064
What are you doing?
We were just talking about you.

37:48.116 --> 37:49.615
Nothing bad,
I assure you.

37:49.651 --> 37:50.783
The night is young.

37:50.819 --> 37:52.235
Oh, here,
let me put you on speaker.

37:52.287 --> 37:54.904
Hey, Dr. B,
you gonna be here soon

37:54.956 --> 37:56.789
or do you want us to go ahead
and order for you?

37:56.825 --> 37:58.291
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:58.326 --> 37:59.792
Why is no one here in the lab?

37:59.828 --> 38:01.961
Honey, are you...
are you feeling okay?

38:01.996 --> 38:05.531
Aside from being abandoned,
yes, I'm fine.

38:05.567 --> 38:08.751
So, you don't remember
sending that e-mail out?

38:08.803 --> 38:12.588
I-I-I don't know
to what you are referring.

38:12.590 --> 38:14.757
The e-mail you sent;
you told us to shut down the lab

38:14.759 --> 38:16.309
and that you were gonna meet us
here at the Founding Fathers.

38:16.344 --> 38:18.761
Hey, Dr. Brennan,
you're so sleep deprived

38:18.763 --> 38:20.229
you probably just don't remember.

38:20.265 --> 38:22.582
No, I assure you
I did no such thing.

38:22.617 --> 38:23.933
Okay, then...

38:23.935 --> 38:27.103
if you didn't send the e-mail,
who did?

38:30.525 --> 38:33.409
I... I have to go.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.610
No, no, no, hold on.

38:34.662 --> 38:37.163
Dr. B, what's happening?

38:38.917 --> 38:41.317
I know who sent that e-mail.

38:41.352 --> 38:43.336
He's here right now.

38:44.339 --> 38:46.005
It's okay.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.257
I just must be having
another nightmare.

38:48.293 --> 38:50.843
Wait, whoa, whoa,
what-what are you talking about?

38:58.770 --> 39:00.386
Dr. B?
Hello?

39:00.438 --> 39:01.554
Um, I'm calling Booth.

39:01.606 --> 39:03.639
This is bad.

39:03.641 --> 39:05.775
Hello?

39:11.449 --> 39:13.699
Call you right back, Cam.

39:13.735 --> 39:15.201
Hey, what's going on?

39:15.236 --> 39:16.786
Ready to go in?

39:16.821 --> 39:18.037
Apparently you are.

39:18.072 --> 39:19.288
Agent Booth, stop.

39:19.324 --> 39:20.323
I don't know what you're...

39:20.375 --> 39:21.574
No, you stop right now, okay?

39:21.626 --> 39:22.992
I need your notes.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.160
Everything you talked
about with my wife.

39:24.212 --> 39:26.078
No, I can't breach
confidentiality.

39:26.130 --> 39:28.664
You can breach confidentiality
if someone's in danger.

39:28.716 --> 39:29.966
Hey...
Get up here. Do you understand me?

39:30.001 --> 39:31.334
She is missing.
He took her

39:31.386 --> 39:33.052
and he's gonna kill her.
I need your damn notes.

39:33.087 --> 39:34.337
All right, take them.
They're in my office.

39:34.339 --> 39:35.338
They're in your office.

39:35.340 --> 39:36.389
Sit down. Okay.

39:36.424 --> 39:37.807
Get the car.

39:37.842 --> 39:39.592
Cam, all right, this is
what we're going to do.

39:39.644 --> 39:42.178
Cam, did you do
everything I asked?

39:42.230 --> 39:43.596
Yeah, were you able
to get the notes?

39:43.648 --> 39:45.314
I got the notebook right here.

39:45.350 --> 39:46.766
All right, what do we have here?

39:46.818 --> 39:48.568
Okay, this
is everything we've got.

39:48.603 --> 39:50.019
Every conceivable detail

39:50.021 --> 39:51.571
about who this
killer could be.

39:51.606 --> 39:53.022
Okay, Aubrey, add to the board,

39:53.024 --> 39:54.690
uh, what we have on the mix tape.
Okay, so...

39:54.692 --> 39:57.660
we know that the killer
was musical, okay?

39:57.695 --> 40:00.446
Likely born after 1978,

40:00.498 --> 40:02.164
somewhere in the
Midwest, probably

40:02.200 --> 40:03.165
in Michigan.

40:03.201 --> 40:04.333
Okay, what else?
In terms of

40:04.369 --> 40:05.334
mathematical and

40:05.370 --> 40:06.669
computational linguistics,

40:06.704 --> 40:07.803
this guy is off the charts.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.705
He also knows human anatomy.

40:09.707 --> 40:11.958
And robotics
or applied engineering.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.626
Also, he's not very strong.

40:13.678 --> 40:14.760
He struggled physically
taking his most recent victim.

40:14.796 --> 40:16.312
Oh, okay. Okay...

40:16.347 --> 40:17.930
1978... Michigan...

40:19.968 --> 40:21.884
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

40:21.886 --> 40:23.786
Wait a second, Bones
mentioned something in this

40:23.821 --> 40:26.272
notebook, talking about
her dreams, yeah.

40:26.307 --> 40:28.357
Here it is.

40:28.393 --> 40:29.525
It's about you.

40:29.561 --> 40:30.893
What? Me-me?

40:30.945 --> 40:32.395
You think I had something
to do with this?

40:32.397 --> 40:33.813
She said that
your hands were

40:33.865 --> 40:34.780
burnt, like they'd been

40:34.816 --> 40:35.781
in some kind of an explosion.

40:35.817 --> 40:36.949
But that doesn't make any sense.

40:36.985 --> 40:38.317
Look at him, his hands are fine.

40:38.369 --> 40:39.785
Yeah, but, come on,
dreams aren't always literal.

40:39.821 --> 40:40.953
I mean, Wendell could

40:40.989 --> 40:41.954
just be a symbol here.

40:41.990 --> 40:43.155
A symbol for what?

40:43.191 --> 40:44.707
For someone who used

40:44.742 --> 40:46.659
to work at the lab.

40:53.167 --> 40:54.884
I know who it is.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.970
Oh, no... it can't be.

41:11.569 --> 41:12.569
I need to see him.

41:12.604 --> 41:13.986
Agent Booth,
it's the middle of the night.

41:14.022 --> 41:15.738
I assure you, he is sleeping.
I need to

41:15.773 --> 41:17.106
see him with my own eyes.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.407
He is sleeping!

41:18.443 --> 41:20.860
Agent Booth,
you can't...!

41:23.581 --> 41:25.831
Agent Booth.

41:25.867 --> 41:26.832
Come back.

41:26.868 --> 41:27.833
Agent Booth!

41:27.869 --> 41:29.669
Agent Booth,
come back.

41:29.704 --> 41:32.238
You can't go into his
room, he's sleeping.

41:32.273 --> 41:33.539
Please, Agent Booth.

41:33.591 --> 41:35.124
Don't disturb him.

41:35.126 --> 41:38.044
Agent Booth, you can't
just barge into his room.

41:50.024 --> 41:52.358
I'll call security.

42:10.828 --> 42:13.579
It's time to wake up.

42:20.838 --> 42:23.255
Zack?

42:24.392 --> 42:26.375
Dr. Brennan,

42:26.411 --> 42:28.594
it is good to see you again.

42:36.137 --> 42:38.237
You and I...

42:38.272 --> 42:40.623
we have so much to talk about.
