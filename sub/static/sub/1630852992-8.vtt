WEBVTT

00:08.217 --> 00:11.261
The truth is that
when you get into riding big waves,

00:11.345 --> 00:14.181
we don't measure 'em by height or width.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.518
We like to just measure 'em
in ferociousness,

00:17.601 --> 00:18.810
or we measure 'em in fear.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.854
His name is Laird Hamilton,

00:20.938 --> 00:23.440
and he is a giant
in the sport of big-wave surfing.

00:23.524 --> 00:27.110
A wall of water,
the equivalent of a seven-story building.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.863
He literally defies death for a living.

00:29.947 --> 00:34.159
For me, the danger,
that's like the icing on the cake.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.829
And just sheer insanity for anyone else.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.250
I will say.

00:42.584 --> 00:46.713
But to think that you could eliminate
being scared or having fear

00:46.797 --> 00:50.843
and still operate at such a high level,
I think that's impossible.

00:50.926 --> 00:56.598
It's really what you do with that emotion,
I think, that really separates you.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.058
- Dear Laird…
- Dear Laird…

00:58.141 --> 00:59.935
- Dear Laird…
- Dear Laird,

01:00.018 --> 01:03.355
Watching your life and your approach
really had an influence on me.

01:04.272 --> 01:07.568
You weren't afraid
to push the limits, challenge conventions,

01:07.651 --> 01:09.069
and venture into the unknown.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.114
You helped me conquer
the biggest wave of my life,

01:12.197 --> 01:14.366
and it has nothing to do with surfing.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.201
At a certain point, fear is fear.

01:16.285 --> 01:19.496
And once you kind of have
a relationship with fear,

01:19.580 --> 01:21.915
you know, you get kinda good at it.

01:21.999 --> 01:26.253
And so, if you can harness that energy,
that's the ultimate freedom.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.755
Dear Laird…

01:36.346 --> 01:40.058
Dear…
LAIRD HAMILTON

01:53.197 --> 01:55.657
Looking around the island for surf today,

01:55.741 --> 01:57.242
North Shore has four-to-six-foot sets…

01:57.326 --> 02:02.456
Growing up, we lived at Banzai Pipeline,
which is a-- It's a world-famous beach

02:02.539 --> 02:06.960
where every great surfer comes
to prove themselves.

02:07.044 --> 02:10.839
And, of course,
I naturally was attracted to the ocean.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.968
My mom said I could crawl to the pool
and swim before I could walk.

02:16.345 --> 02:19.181
But Banzai Pipeline was
a very dangerous beach.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.518
You know, at one point,
there was a giant swell and, you know,

02:22.601 --> 02:24.561
four people just went missing
off the beach.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.439
And so I would get rescued daily.

02:27.523 --> 02:30.609
Like, I was four or five years old.
"There's Laird in the rip current again."

02:31.193 --> 02:34.029
The lifeguards got to a point
where they were so tired of rescuing me

02:34.112 --> 02:37.074
they would come to the house and be like,
"Hey, Laird's out in the rip again.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.452
You cannot let him go to the beach
without supervision."

02:40.536 --> 02:43.038
So, they'd be like-- My mom,
like, "Oh, he's in his room napping."

02:43.121 --> 02:44.498
And they'd be like, "No."

02:44.581 --> 02:45.874
And, like, I climbed out my room.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.918
There was, like, a banyan tree
I could crawl down

02:48.001 --> 02:50.212
and go to the beach
and get sucked out in the rip current.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.172
That was so fun.

02:52.256 --> 02:53.257
Very fun.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.387
I think the biggest attraction
with the ocean was just,

02:58.470 --> 03:01.098
there was some scariness about the ocean,

03:01.181 --> 03:04.643
and then that added
to the whole sensation of the fun.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.981
When there's a level of danger,

03:09.064 --> 03:12.901
it forces you to use all your skills
and your senses.

03:12.985 --> 03:16.405
And that makes it kind of
an all-consuming experience.

03:16.488 --> 03:21.076
The cares of the land and the-- and
all the other things that we worry about

03:21.159 --> 03:24.204
and all the other things
that are happening just cease to exist.

03:24.705 --> 03:28.917
And for me, at a very young age,
I didn't have a father that was present.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.754
And so I was fortunate
to have the environment too

03:32.838 --> 03:37.885
that I could just take all that energy
and put it into the-- the ocean.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.972
I think I was looking for a dad,
so that was my mission.

03:42.055 --> 03:47.352
And, I took it upon myself to,
you know, cupid, pull the arrow back…

03:47.436 --> 03:50.522
…and, you know,
try to sh-- try to find one,

03:50.606 --> 03:52.608
and-- and-- and it worked.

03:53.358 --> 03:58.488
I introduced my mom to Bill Hamilton,
who was a phenomenal surfer.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.033
At the time, he was one of the greats.

04:01.116 --> 04:05.120
I mean, I spent a lot of time running
around telling people Bill was my dad.

04:05.204 --> 04:08.332
Probably much more than I would have
if he was actually my father.

04:08.415 --> 04:12.252
But he was a young guy,
and I think he was still growing up.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.171
And so as I got a little bit older,

04:14.254 --> 04:17.466
it was difficult for him
to be an authority over me,

04:17.548 --> 04:21.470
given, you know,
my lack of, obedience.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.431
I think I was a lot to handle.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.058
I don't like to be told what to do.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.018
And then Bill had a serious temper,

04:28.101 --> 04:32.189
and I was very good at, erupting it.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.735
And that temper was something
that led him to lose control.

04:37.319 --> 04:41.907
And so, I was getting a belt spanking that
left black and blue marks all the time.

04:42.699 --> 04:47.079
And so I was being raised
in an environment that built insecurity.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.956
Definitely built insecurity.

04:49.039 --> 04:53.544
And especially when you combine
that situation with me being an outcast.

04:54.920 --> 04:59.174
The high school that I went to was
very diverse… cultural group in it.

04:59.258 --> 05:03.887
So you had Japanese, Filipinos,
Hawaiians, you had Portuguese,

05:03.971 --> 05:06.473
and then you had, like, one or two blonds.

05:06.557 --> 05:09.935
And I was in the one or two blonds
category.

05:10.394 --> 05:14.648
And so, you physically look different,
which brings attention to you,

05:14.731 --> 05:20.112
and then that high school was third
in the nation for crime and violence.

05:20.195 --> 05:23.323
It was, like, East LA,
the Bronx, my school.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.033
Like, dangerous school.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.494
And so I was always on guard.

05:27.578 --> 05:31.999
You know, eat your lunch fast, like,
really fast, or somebody's gonna take it.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.543
Your back's against the wall
so you can see what's coming.

05:35.127 --> 05:39.256
Which resulted in that I would ditch
school and go and be out surfing.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.466
And so, I wasn't going to school a lot.

05:41.550 --> 05:45.179
I-- At one point, I was absent
45 days in a 90-day quarter.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.557
It was all about
getting back in the water.

05:49.766 --> 05:54.021
In the water, I had equality with all.

05:55.772 --> 05:59.067
It was a completely neutral playing field.

05:59.151 --> 06:03.822
You would be respected by your skill,
in the ocean.

06:03.906 --> 06:06.992
And so that was a place
to actually build strength

06:07.075 --> 06:08.952
and learning
how to truly rely on yourself.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.164
And putting yourself in situations
time and time again

06:12.247 --> 06:16.376
that only you would get yourself out of
built confidence.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.212
And…

06:18.295 --> 06:20.839
And that was constructive,
not-- not destructive.

06:20.923 --> 06:25.511
So, for me, that, you know,
saved my life. You know?

06:25.594 --> 06:27.596
Saved-- For sure saved my life.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.481
Dear Laird,

06:37.564 --> 06:39.358
I have always dreamt of flying.

06:39.441 --> 06:42.653
When I was a child, I can remember
watching birds step off telephone poles,

06:42.736 --> 06:44.655
open their wings, take flight.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.783
I told my aunt,
"I'm gonna do that one day."

06:47.866 --> 06:50.536
She looked at me and explained
it was physically impossible.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.955
I responded with…
"Maybe for you."

06:54.706 --> 06:56.250
"I was different as a child.

06:56.333 --> 07:00.128
I always seemed to gravitate towards
things that were a bit frightening."

07:00.212 --> 07:02.756
I grew up in New Mexico
and didn't have many friends.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.260
School was a war zone for me,
fighting every single day.

07:06.343 --> 07:10.222
Depression, suicidal thoughts,
and existential angst took hold,

07:10.305 --> 07:12.933
and life just felt devoid of purpose.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.603
When I turned 16,
my family moved to Malibu,

07:16.687 --> 07:18.063
and I began surfing.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.898
That's when I first heard of you.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.860
You couldn't surf in Malibu
without knowing who Laird Hamilton was.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.654
You didn't seem interested
in competitions.

07:25.737 --> 07:29.533
You appeared to be more focused on
just doing your own thing

07:29.616 --> 07:32.995
and riding the most massive waves
the ocean had ever produced.

07:33.078 --> 07:36.373
"As a young surfer,
there's no doubt that I tried to emulate

07:36.456 --> 07:37.708
what you were doing.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.751
I admired the way you pushed boundaries

07:39.835 --> 07:42.754
for the therapy of it
as much as for the sport."

07:42.838 --> 07:45.674
At that time,
I had a similar drive myself,

07:45.757 --> 07:49.094
but I was still searching for a place
to direct that energy.

07:49.178 --> 07:53.932
One day I came across a documentary
on a fringe sport called BASE jumping.

07:54.641 --> 07:58.270
BASE is an acronym for
"building," "antenna," "span" and "earth,"

07:58.353 --> 08:02.983
four main categories of objects
people use as platforms for human flight.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.526
I instantly froze.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.862
I felt a powerful energy
run through my body,

08:06.945 --> 08:12.826
and I knew to my core that I was going to
spend the rest of my life doing this.

08:12.910 --> 08:16.747
After five years of intense training,
I began BASE jumping.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.582
I remember the first serious jump I did.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.251
"I contacted my mentor to get advice,

08:21.335 --> 08:24.004
and they warned me, 'Don't do that jump.'"

08:24.087 --> 08:27.466
"That jump will equal death,
and it's not worth it."

08:29.301 --> 08:33.304
Up to that point, I had wondered if I was
capable of really being a BASE jumper.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.390
I wasn't sure if I could push through

08:35.474 --> 08:38.559
the gut-wrenching horror
that activity produced.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.565
That jump shifted my perspective on life.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.903
It changed me as a human being forever.

08:47.986 --> 08:51.156
I realized
nothing was ever going to stand in my way,

08:51.240 --> 08:52.950
not even me.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.329
After that day, I was a BASE jumper.

08:57.412 --> 09:00.749
But at the time, making money
as a BASE jumper wasn't really a thing,

09:00.832 --> 09:03.794
and normal jobs were
soul-sucking work for me.

09:06.630 --> 09:11.260
Watching your life, I saw a guy
who decided to do things his own way

09:11.343 --> 09:13.887
and make a living at it on his own terms.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.765
That was the soul of how you inspired me.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.517
"You carved your own path,

09:18.600 --> 09:21.186
and you made me realize
I could do the same."

09:22.187 --> 09:24.189
I decided I was going to travel the world

09:24.273 --> 09:27.150
and jump off anything
and everything in my path.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.654
Now I've been making a living as
a professional BASE jumper for 20 years.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.323
I also speak openly
about my struggles with depression

09:33.407 --> 09:35.868
and how extreme experiences
help me cope with it.

09:35.951 --> 09:39.788
Accepting my own mortality has become
a reoccurring theme in my life,

09:39.872 --> 09:42.040
and I use it in my motivational speaking.

09:42.124 --> 09:47.546
"Once you accept death's inevitability,
it somehow frees you from the fear of it."

09:48.088 --> 09:49.298
That's for sure.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.175
Watching your body of work
helped me see

09:51.258 --> 09:54.595
that life is just a series of experiences
you have until you die.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.348
That's it. It's simple.

09:58.432 --> 10:02.519
I'm just trying to make those experiences
as incredible as I possibly can.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.522
Laird, you walked this path before me

10:05.606 --> 10:09.359
and showed me that it was possible
to make a living following my passion.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.445
For that, I'm eternally grateful.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.497
Once I got a little bit older

10:22.581 --> 10:26.752
and I was able to surf better than a lot
of the adults that you're surfing with…

10:28.462 --> 10:29.463
you got a bad attitude.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.840
You just-- You just--
You know, you're obnoxious.

10:33.842 --> 10:37.971
There is a level of aggression
that happens in certain breaks.

10:39.223 --> 10:42.434
You know, there's a couple surfers
that get all the choice waves.

10:42.518 --> 10:45.729
It'd be like a hunting party.
Who gets the ch-- the prime catch?

10:45.812 --> 10:48.440
And everybody else is gonna be
battling over the scraps.

10:51.193 --> 10:55.113
As a young man, you're fighting
your way up the pecking order, right?

10:55.197 --> 10:57.574
You're clawing at the hierarchy.

10:58.367 --> 11:01.620
You know, the truth is that I have
a loud voice, and I would yell a lot,

11:01.703 --> 11:07.876
and they would just be like,
"Shut up. Just shut up. Just be quiet."

11:07.960 --> 11:09.294
Like, I always am apologizing.

11:09.378 --> 11:11.463
To this day, I'm like,
"Yeah, really sorry about that."

11:11.547 --> 11:13.966
You know, like…
…30 years, 40 years ago.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.677
"Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I'd--"
You know?

11:18.846 --> 11:22.015
And then big-wave riding
kind of changed that for me.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.686
Because when the surf was really big,
everybody got real friendly.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.273
That's a dangerous environment.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.276
And so, the challenge becomes the wave
and not the other guy.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.486
Oh, my God. Look at th-- Oh!

11:34.570 --> 11:37.281
And everybody would be
real supportive of one another

11:37.364 --> 11:39.741
and prot--
and even looking out for one another.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.287
It's like the ocean needed to be
more aggressive

11:43.370 --> 11:44.955
to kinda keep the humans at check.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.874
Like, calm the humans down,
get real aggressive.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.667
Everybody's like,
"Hey, you want this one?"

11:48.750 --> 11:49.751
"No, you go ahead."

11:49.835 --> 11:52.296
"Okay, I'll take it, thanks. All right."
You know?

11:52.379 --> 11:54.089
A lot of sharing when it's big.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.888
So when it came time
to make decisions about

12:00.971 --> 12:03.223
if I wanted to surf in contests or not,

12:03.807 --> 12:07.269
for me, I-- I felt like
I was already naturally so aggressive

12:07.352 --> 12:09.563
that that environment was just
not great for me.

12:10.147 --> 12:12.191
I just felt like I had another calling.

12:12.274 --> 12:14.359
I was being called a different direction

12:14.443 --> 12:18.530
and-- and-- and needed to
stay on that path.

12:22.284 --> 12:26.205
I wanted to become
the best at the biggest.

12:27.206 --> 12:28.415
And so in a way,

12:28.498 --> 12:35.214
my surfing has always been a place
to express my-- my artistry, you know?

12:35.297 --> 12:39.176
Like, where every wave is different,
every ride is different.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.512
Even on the same day,
there's no two rides the same,

12:41.595 --> 12:43.013
there's no two waves the same.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.557
And when the wave's over, it's… done.

12:45.641 --> 12:50.979
It's similar to the-- the building
of the sand picture by the monks…

12:52.689 --> 12:54.733
and then the blowing away of it.

12:57.236 --> 13:00.822
And that's part of
why you cherish it so much,

13:00.906 --> 13:03.367
because only you got that one like that.

13:11.500 --> 13:15.295
The irony is that through big-wave riding…

13:15.379 --> 13:20.175
I got the notoriety that I hadn't gotten
by beating others in competition.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.687
Dear Laird,

13:31.770 --> 13:34.565
You embody courage,
strength and positivity,

13:34.648 --> 13:36.233
both in and out of the water.

13:36.817 --> 13:41.613
Although I'm not a surfer like you, Laird,
I do feel most at home in the water.

13:41.697 --> 13:44.825
I'm a swimmer,
and I come from a family of swimmers.

13:44.908 --> 13:47.452
So you could say
that the water is in my blood.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.496
"I enjoyed an active childhood

13:49.580 --> 13:52.583
and found passion
in fitness, training and nutrition.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.794
My ultimate goal was to own my own gym."

13:55.878 --> 13:57.504
But when I was a teenager,

13:57.588 --> 14:01.300
I started experiencing fatigue
and dizzy spells.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.218
I ignored my symptoms at first

14:03.302 --> 14:06.305
because I didn't want to accept that
I had an illness.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.432
I wanted to be "normal."

14:08.515 --> 14:10.267
I kept this facade up for years,

14:10.350 --> 14:14.521
pushing my body beyond its limits
until I had all I could take.

14:14.605 --> 14:19.026
I was on my way home from vacation,
and I suddenly fell gravely ill.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.653
I could barely stand.

14:21.737 --> 14:25.574
I was rushed to the hospital
and diagnosed with Crohn's disease,

14:25.657 --> 14:30.204
a chronic inflammatory disorder that
weakens the digestive system and beyond.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.124
"I've always lived a healthy lifestyle.

14:34.208 --> 14:35.709
How could this happen to me?

14:36.418 --> 14:40.881
I spent over a week in the hospital
and several months in rehabilitation."

14:40.964 --> 14:44.593
I had to be on strong medication
to manage the severe pain.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.805
My active lifestyle vanished
in an instant.

14:48.889 --> 14:52.601
I was gaining weight and falling under…
…severe depression.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.229
"And since Crohn's disease has no cure,

14:55.312 --> 14:59.358
I wrestled with the idea that I could be
fighting this for the rest of my life."

15:00.567 --> 15:02.152
And then my lifeline came.

15:02.236 --> 15:06.865
I was in the hospital watching videos,
searching for some sort of motivation,

15:06.949 --> 15:08.534
and that's when I found you, Laird.

15:08.617 --> 15:12.371
Being a professional swimmer,
I connected with you instantly.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.250
"You spoke about what it felt like
to stare death in the eyes."

15:16.834 --> 15:18.836
You said that when those moments come,

15:18.919 --> 15:22.047
we develop a greater appreciation
for our health.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.425
That deeply resonated with me
when I was in the hospital.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.928
Crohn's disease was my big wave.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.930
"I was completely transformed.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.349
My outlook changed,

15:32.432 --> 15:34.643
and I was motivated
to pull myself out of the dark

15:34.726 --> 15:36.603
and fight for the life I wanted."

15:36.687 --> 15:39.356
Laird, you truly saved my life.

15:42.234 --> 15:44.862
"I owe this enlightened mindset…"

15:44.945 --> 15:45.946
…to you, Laird.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.573
I've been able to accomplish things

15:47.656 --> 15:50.158
which many believed were impossible
with my condition.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.786
I have swum the English Channel,

15:52.870 --> 15:56.373
and I accomplished my dream
of opening my very own training gym,

15:56.456 --> 15:59.001
which has been running for over ten years.

15:59.084 --> 16:03.422
It's another opportunity to live bigger,
stronger and happier.

16:04.006 --> 16:06.175
May we keep riding the big waves.

16:17.311 --> 16:21.940
As a big-wave rider, you put a lot of time
and effort and energy and belief into

16:22.024 --> 16:24.776
the possibility of riding the unrideable.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.947
There's always been
a limitation in big-wave riding

16:29.031 --> 16:31.700
'cause you have to manually paddle
by hand to catch these waves.

16:31.783 --> 16:36.205
And when the surf goes beyond
a certain height and speed,

16:36.288 --> 16:40.083
it becomes almost impossible for you
to catch it by hand.

16:40.167 --> 16:44.213
It was something that
I had believed can be done,

16:44.296 --> 16:48.383
but I wasn't sure, and I-- and I was
maybe beginning to doubt.

16:53.764 --> 16:56.183
I remember we were playing around
in the summertime.

16:56.266 --> 17:00.646
There was no surf, and so we were in
some really tiny little waves with a boat.

17:00.729 --> 17:01.813
And the guy pulled me,

17:01.897 --> 17:04.066
and I went onto a wave,
and I just had an epiphany.

17:04.148 --> 17:10.321
I was like, okay, we can use a craft
to pull the surfer up to speed

17:10.405 --> 17:13.325
in order to get on the wave,
and then he can ride the wave.

17:14.576 --> 17:17.538
And so, we implemented it
into some big surf,

17:17.621 --> 17:19.248
and we were just off and running.

17:26.505 --> 17:30.175
All of our focus went to building
equipment for that technique

17:30.259 --> 17:32.803
and looking for waves
that are bigger and bigger every time.

17:32.886 --> 17:36.390
And so that's how we created
the tow-in technique,

17:36.473 --> 17:39.142
catching giant waves.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.316
Hi, I'm Gabrielle Reece.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.444
Today I'm on the beautiful
North Shore of Maui…

17:49.528 --> 17:53.115
…hanging out with an extremist
who catches some serious waves.

17:53.198 --> 17:56.577
His name is Laird Hamilton,
and he lives for the big swell.

17:58.954 --> 18:02.207
The timing was amazing
to have Gabby in my life.

18:02.291 --> 18:03.792
My soul mate.

18:05.419 --> 18:08.797
She's supported me in ways
that I'm only beginning to understand.

18:10.841 --> 18:15.554
She obviously sees things in me
that I don't see in myself,

18:15.637 --> 18:20.267
because that would be the only way
she could be with me.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.351
But--

18:21.435 --> 18:27.357
But the truth is, is,
without Gabby, the love of my life,

18:27.441 --> 18:29.860
I wouldn't be sitting
right here right now, for sure.

18:30.569 --> 18:34.031
And so, I do believe in
a certain level of predestine

18:34.114 --> 18:35.657
when it comes to certain things.

18:36.450 --> 18:39.745
For an example,
when I went on my first trip to Tahiti…

18:40.245 --> 18:43.749
…Gabby and I had some, you know,
turmoil in our relationship,

18:43.832 --> 18:46.543
and so I was a little bit reckless.

18:48.462 --> 18:52.132
In Tahiti, there's a particular wave
called Teahupo'o,

18:52.216 --> 18:54.551
which means, "wall of skulls."

18:56.136 --> 19:00.098
So we went there with this tow-in
technique that we had developed.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.184
After a couple of weeks of assessment,

19:02.267 --> 19:04.770
there was a forecast
for a-- an enormous swell.

19:05.604 --> 19:07.606
And the Tahitians were like,
"You know, this is--

19:07.689 --> 19:10.192
We don't ride it when it's like this.
This is too big.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.361
We'll go to another wave.
We have another wave."

19:12.444 --> 19:14.655
And I was like, "Yeah, no.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.741
We're not gonna leave
before we can try to ride Teahupo'o."

19:18.450 --> 19:22.204
And the swell, did not disappoint.

19:23.956 --> 19:26.041
It was completely unrideable.

19:26.667 --> 19:31.547
It's the most vicious pit bull
that you've ever seen.

19:31.630 --> 19:35.634
And it doesn't have the face height,

19:35.717 --> 19:39.179
but that speaks nothing
of the velocity of that wave.

19:39.263 --> 19:43.475
And it's breaking on a live coral reef,
so if you hit the bottom out there, you--

19:43.559 --> 19:46.937
you know, it's kinda like hitting
a cheese grater, at speed.

19:47.646 --> 19:50.691
In fact, a month before, someone had been
killed at that same location

19:50.774 --> 19:52.025
from hitting the bottom.

19:53.819 --> 19:58.240
And so, you didn't wanna have any,
hesitation, you know?

19:58.323 --> 20:01.159
In surfing, hesitation is a bad thing.

20:01.243 --> 20:05.455
And because it was an emotional time
with my relationship with Gabby,

20:05.539 --> 20:10.669
I was a little bit, like--
like, just gonna…

20:10.752 --> 20:12.379
You know, I'll just-- Yeah.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.506
"Let's go to the cliff.
I'll show you how high."

20:18.927 --> 20:21.263
Nothing had ever been ridden
like that before,

20:21.346 --> 20:23.807
so there was a level of fear.

20:29.730 --> 20:33.150
During the ride,
I had a conversation, uh, with myself.

20:33.233 --> 20:36.570
You know, the halo and the horns.
The two, they were talking.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.865
And one of them was like,
"Jump off, jump off,"

20:39.948 --> 20:42.534
and the other was like, "Well,
if you jump off, you can't make it."

20:42.618 --> 20:46.121
I opted to not jump off
and just tried to stay on.

20:48.290 --> 20:51.793
That really was
a defining moment in my life.

20:52.336 --> 20:54.880
You have this thing in your mind
that you think can be done,

20:54.963 --> 20:57.549
and you spend your whole life pursuing it.

20:57.633 --> 21:03.263
I was just relieved to, like, finally have
been able to actually do it, you know?

21:03.347 --> 21:06.642
Like, I'd been… blessed.

21:11.104 --> 21:15.734
I think I called,
Gabby later that day or something,

21:16.527 --> 21:17.819
and…

21:20.572 --> 21:21.949
That-- We-- We kind of…

21:23.408 --> 21:25.994
That was, like,
the beginning of our reconciliation.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.997
It was good. It was perfect.

21:29.081 --> 21:31.458
I got that, and then I was--

21:31.542 --> 21:35.128
then it was-- then I could
the other thing back.

21:39.591 --> 21:43.512
This particular ride sent
a shock wave through the surfing world…

21:43.595 --> 21:50.102
…and defined not only the tow-in technique
but what was rideable and not rideable,

21:50.185 --> 21:54.273
and changed big-wave riding, um, forever.

22:04.533 --> 22:07.744
Dear Laird,
You are a master of innovation.

22:07.828 --> 22:10.539
You sought to go to new heights
in your surfing

22:10.622 --> 22:14.126
and created new avenues
like tow-in and foiling

22:14.209 --> 22:16.336
to take you to uncharted territory.

22:16.962 --> 22:20.549
Like you,
I also rely on innovation and technology,

22:21.175 --> 22:25.053
not just in my craft,
but also in my everyday life.

22:25.137 --> 22:26.638
My name is Martin.

22:26.722 --> 22:29.808
I'm a triple amputee and adaptive surfer.

22:32.352 --> 22:33.645
"I grew up in Cornwall…"

22:33.729 --> 22:36.690
…a fishing community
on the southwestern tip of England.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.735
And oddly enough,
even though it was all around me,

22:39.818 --> 22:41.570
I didn't grow up surfing.

22:41.653 --> 22:44.740
I did lead a very active lifestyle,
though,

22:44.823 --> 22:49.828
and enjoyed a host of sports,
like soccer, rugby, in-line skating,

22:49.912 --> 22:53.165
cricket, cross-country,
mountain biking and cliff jumping.

22:53.707 --> 22:56.293
So it's safe to call me
an adrenaline lover.

22:58.879 --> 23:02.633
This love for adventure is partly
what drove me to joining the British army.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.261
I took great pride in serving my country,

23:06.345 --> 23:08.555
but things took a sudden and painful turn.

23:10.599 --> 23:12.976
Four months into my tour of Afghanistan,

23:13.060 --> 23:14.603
I was hit by an IED.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.691
"I lost both my legs and my left arm."

23:22.653 --> 23:25.322
I spent the next five years
of my life in rehab,

23:25.405 --> 23:28.283
trying to get back to the active lifestyle
that I had before.

23:29.701 --> 23:32.162
At first, I couldn't even sit myself up,

23:32.246 --> 23:34.665
so it took quite a while
to get my balance back.

23:35.165 --> 23:39.419
Adding to that was the frustrating
back-and-forth battle with my prosthetics.

23:39.503 --> 23:41.088
It was a major adjustment.

23:41.964 --> 23:43.924
Then one day at the rehab center,

23:44.007 --> 23:46.385
I was introduced
to a program called Operation Surf,

23:47.219 --> 23:49.930
which taught wounded veterans
how to take to the waves.

23:53.684 --> 23:55.394
I took to surfing immediately.

23:56.395 --> 23:59.773
It was quite a natural progression
from what I'd been doing before.

24:00.566 --> 24:03.151
I even had my prosthetist
make me a paddle arm

24:03.235 --> 24:06.738
to give me the leverage I needed
to better navigate the water.

24:07.281 --> 24:09.491
I began extensive research online,

24:09.575 --> 24:12.160
trying to absorb
as much as I could about surfing.

24:13.036 --> 24:15.122
And that's when I discovered you, Laird.

24:16.540 --> 24:19.543
I learned about
all of your innovations, techniques,

24:19.626 --> 24:22.588
and the rich history and impact
you've made in the surfing world.

24:23.422 --> 24:28.093
I saw you at work in the water, especially
your innovative surfing methods,

24:28.719 --> 24:32.347
and thought, "If a surfing icon
is developing special methods

24:32.431 --> 24:33.974
to achieve his best moves,

24:34.057 --> 24:36.310
then there might be
a future in this for me."

24:37.144 --> 24:39.396
"You quickly became my inspiration."

24:40.272 --> 24:42.399
I've gone on to surf in competitions

24:42.482 --> 24:45.611
such as the English Nationals,
World Championships,

24:46.195 --> 24:49.615
and I even won first place
in the English Open's Assisted category.

24:51.116 --> 24:52.910
Beyond the competitions,

24:52.993 --> 24:56.747
my bigger mission is to be
a mentor and inspiration to others,

24:56.830 --> 24:58.415
as you've been to me.

24:59.416 --> 25:01.126
I've worked with fellow veterans

25:01.210 --> 25:05.672
and even children born
with similar limb deficiencies as I have,

25:05.756 --> 25:08.217
showing them how
and what's possible with surfing.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.304
Like you, Laird, surfing is not my hobby.

25:12.387 --> 25:14.264
It's my entire life.

25:14.348 --> 25:16.350
It's more important to me than walking.

25:17.684 --> 25:21.104
I owe a huge debt of gratitude to you
for all you have shown me.

25:21.939 --> 25:25.442
Here's to catching more waves,
breaking more conventions,

25:25.526 --> 25:28.237
and riding victoriously
over anything that comes our way.

25:29.655 --> 25:31.990
"The Champion. Martin, the Champion."

25:35.160 --> 25:38.205
- How was that one?
- Strong. They're all strong.

25:46.004 --> 25:49.466
You know, all you need to be an inventor
is an imagination and a pile of junk.

25:50.551 --> 25:53.387
I had my first daughter, and I was like,
"I wanna take her in the ocean.

25:53.470 --> 25:56.557
So I'm gonna put her on a board with me,
but I need a big board to do that."

25:56.640 --> 25:59.518
And so I started riding
these really large boards.

26:00.561 --> 26:02.312
And then again
I had the epiphany of, like,

26:02.396 --> 26:06.400
it would be amazing just to be
able to stay up and paddle the whole time.

26:06.483 --> 26:08.902
And so I had some special paddles built,

26:08.986 --> 26:11.530
and that eventually became
stand-up paddling.

26:14.157 --> 26:16.743
Initially I started using it
for working out,

26:16.827 --> 26:18.662
and then I started riding little waves,

26:19.454 --> 26:21.415
then I started riding little bigger waves.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.543
Pretty soon we were riding giant waves.

26:26.461 --> 26:29.089
And then we started paddling distances,

26:29.173 --> 26:31.425
and then pretty soon there was races.

26:31.508 --> 26:33.719
Before you know it,
it went from my boat ramp

26:33.802 --> 26:36.305
to all the way across the world.

26:37.222 --> 26:39.641
So, you never know
where an idea will go.

26:42.394 --> 26:46.940
But that process
of starting from an idea, nothing,

26:47.024 --> 26:51.195
to building a prototype,
to learning how to ride a prototype,

26:51.278 --> 26:53.197
it's the most fulfilling aspect

26:53.280 --> 26:55.657
because you're coming
from nothing to something.

26:56.241 --> 27:00.037
And what's interesting is,
through the whole process,

27:00.120 --> 27:04.625
what I really, really enjoy the most is
being a beginner.

27:05.667 --> 27:09.171
I remember when I first started
foiling in small surf.

27:09.254 --> 27:13.050
I'm like, "Yeah, no, this is big for me.
Like, today, this is gonna be big."

27:13.133 --> 27:15.552
It's like tying your hands together
and your feet together

27:15.636 --> 27:18.222
and doing something
after you've done something really well.

27:18.305 --> 27:21.016
It's gonna be difficult. It's like,
"Hey, I'm good on the bicycle."

27:21.099 --> 27:23.810
Well, do downhill on a unicycle.
That'll be exciting.

27:23.894 --> 27:26.563
You won't even--
It won't take much of a hill, you know?

27:26.647 --> 27:29.733
I describe it, then,
retaining your youthful enthusiasm.

27:29.816 --> 27:33.195
You know, be a little kid,
always willing to do something new.

27:34.780 --> 27:37.324
When you've watched that process
enough times,

27:38.784 --> 27:40.661
you begin to like that process.

27:40.744 --> 27:42.913
And it doesn't even have to be
within sport.

27:44.164 --> 27:48.544
There's a whole program that I developed
during my preparation for big-wave riding.

27:49.211 --> 27:53.507
It was something that I was naturally
doing for my longevity, ultimately,

27:53.590 --> 27:55.592
to continue to perform at a high level.

27:56.844 --> 28:00.556
A friend of ours said, "Hey, you know,
this thing that you're naturally doing,

28:00.639 --> 28:02.099
you should package it

28:02.182 --> 28:06.478
so that people can experience,
some of the stuff that you're doing."

28:06.562 --> 28:08.397
And so I decided to do it.

28:08.981 --> 28:13.902
It's given me an opportunity to share
parts of my life that could be useful.

28:13.986 --> 28:15.946
And most of the things that I share

28:16.029 --> 28:18.782
are things that I've learned
from people that shared with me.

28:18.866 --> 28:21.910
And so, in a way,
I think that through sharing,

28:21.994 --> 28:25.873
you accomplish probably the single
most important thing as a human,

28:25.956 --> 28:28.208
which is being of service.

28:28.292 --> 28:29.585
Be of service.

28:34.298 --> 28:35.507
Dear Laird,

28:35.591 --> 28:38.719
You're famous for your groundbreaking
strength and endurance program,

28:38.802 --> 28:41.305
but I wonder if you ever knew
it would save someone's life.

28:41.388 --> 28:42.598
That someone was me.

28:43.348 --> 28:44.600
My name is Aaron.

28:44.683 --> 28:46.894
I grew up in California,
living near the beach,

28:46.977 --> 28:48.478
but I was never interested in surfing.

28:48.979 --> 28:50.814
My heart belonged on the football field.

28:50.898 --> 28:53.275
But everything changed
my sophomore year in high school

28:53.358 --> 28:55.152
after I injured my back on the field.

28:56.153 --> 28:58.405
I would never be able
to play football again.

28:58.488 --> 29:00.449
My first love was taken away from me.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.869
That's when I watched Step Into Liquid,

29:05.245 --> 29:08.081
the documentary featuring you
and other surfing legends.

29:08.665 --> 29:09.875
I became fascinated with

29:09.958 --> 29:13.295
the countless ways you've innovated
and expanded the art of surfing,

29:13.378 --> 29:15.422
not to mention your drive
and fearlessness.

29:15.506 --> 29:18.425
"Learning more about you
solidified things for me.

29:19.009 --> 29:20.928
I was ready to begin a new chapter."

29:21.011 --> 29:23.597
There's something
so alluring about the ocean.

29:23.680 --> 29:26.600
And living right next to the water,
it's hard to avoid the beckoning waves.

29:26.683 --> 29:28.936
So I saved my allowance,
purchased a surfboard,

29:29.019 --> 29:31.396
and I walked to the beach
every day to practice.

29:32.105 --> 29:34.149
As I became more and more
comfortable in the water,

29:34.233 --> 29:36.401
I built up the courage
to go for the bigger waves.

29:36.485 --> 29:38.779
But I wanted my body
to be prepared as well.

29:38.862 --> 29:41.490
"That's when I discovered
your XPT training,

29:41.573 --> 29:43.534
specifically your pool training method."

29:44.117 --> 29:46.912
I'd empty my lungs, sink
to the bottom of the pool with weights,

29:46.995 --> 29:48.580
and run across the bottom.

29:48.664 --> 29:51.875
Once I exhaled, I would jump up
and push off the bottom of the pool,

29:51.959 --> 29:53.836
take a breath and go back down.

29:53.919 --> 29:55.963
This helped develop the stamina
necessary to deal with

29:56.046 --> 29:58.715
the harsh conditions that may be
awaiting in the water.

29:58.799 --> 30:02.636
Not only that, it helped build
my confidence in my own capabilities.

30:02.719 --> 30:05.180
It was time for me to put
this preparation to the test.

30:05.264 --> 30:08.058
I set out to conquer
the massive waves in Santa Cruz.

30:09.852 --> 30:11.603
My buddies and I paddled out to sea,

30:11.687 --> 30:14.731
heavily anticipating
the infamous waves we'd heard about.

30:14.815 --> 30:16.233
I was the good kind of scared.

30:16.316 --> 30:18.569
The calm of the ocean was
almost deafening.

30:18.652 --> 30:20.112
And then it broke open.

30:20.195 --> 30:23.282
A 20-foot set rolled in,
and I went for it head-on.

30:23.866 --> 30:27.369
I rode the wave successfully,
kicked out and paddled back out for more.

30:27.953 --> 30:30.330
But my victorious moment was cut short.

30:30.414 --> 30:34.585
The most fearsome wave of the day crashed
in front of me, swallowing me whole.

30:36.670 --> 30:37.671
I panicked.

30:37.754 --> 30:40.549
I dove off the board
and swam down as deep as I could.

30:41.091 --> 30:45.095
But in my attempt to go under the wave,
my leash snapped and my board disappeared.

30:45.179 --> 30:47.222
And at that moment, I was petrified.

30:47.306 --> 30:49.391
I knew for certain I was going to die.

30:50.642 --> 30:53.353
"But then I remember your words, Laird.

30:54.146 --> 30:55.606
'Remain calm.'

30:55.689 --> 30:57.566
I knew if I calmed down

30:57.649 --> 31:00.402
and envisioned myself
coming out of the situation,

31:00.485 --> 31:01.945
I would survive."

31:02.029 --> 31:05.407
In a snap, I shifted my mindset
and embraced the deep.

31:05.490 --> 31:08.160
I dove down and braced for the impact,

31:08.243 --> 31:10.913
which was the most violent hold-down
I've ever experienced.

31:10.996 --> 31:13.415
With the shore being
roughly 300 yards away,

31:13.498 --> 31:15.876
I knew swimming
back to shore was out of the question.

31:15.959 --> 31:17.419
Whenever a wave approached,

31:17.503 --> 31:20.797
I used your technique and let
the waves push me back towards the shore.

31:20.881 --> 31:24.635
It was the real-life moment your
simulated pool training prepared me for.

31:26.720 --> 31:30.641
"A harrowing 20 minutes later,
I arrived at the beach safe and sound…"

31:30.724 --> 31:33.769
…and with a newfound respect
for the power of a big wave.

31:33.852 --> 31:36.855
But even more importantly,
I had a greater appreciation for my life…

31:36.939 --> 31:38.607
"…something you taught me."

31:39.399 --> 31:42.819
Because of your training,
both mentally and physically,

31:42.903 --> 31:44.905
I'm here to live and surf another day.

31:48.825 --> 31:51.662
GABBY - How does that make you feel,
Laird, reading that?

31:54.039 --> 31:59.211
…honored, thankful, appreciative.

32:00.087 --> 32:02.172
Not all in vain.

32:03.966 --> 32:07.052
The end, if somebody said to me,

32:07.135 --> 32:09.388
"What was your accomplishment
in your life?"

32:09.471 --> 32:12.099
How about, "I raised content humans"?

32:12.933 --> 32:14.518
I could-- I--

32:14.601 --> 32:17.145
What did they say about him?
They'd go, "He raised content humans."

32:17.229 --> 32:19.982
I'd go, "That would be--
That would be an accomplishment."

32:21.900 --> 32:25.487
I'm trying to be the father
that I think I wanted.

32:27.155 --> 32:31.952
That's the pinnacle, right?
That's the pinnacle of our existence.

32:33.203 --> 32:36.290
Later on, I came to realize that
they don't call it "kidding."

32:36.373 --> 32:38.333
They call it "parenting."
It's about our evolution.

32:38.417 --> 32:40.002
It's not about their evolution.

32:40.878 --> 32:42.880
They're just watching your actions.

32:42.963 --> 32:44.423
That's a challenge every single day,

32:44.506 --> 32:48.427
and I'm just trying to be in a way
that-- that I want them to see.

32:48.510 --> 32:53.182
And part of that is trying to be happy
and learning to evolve.

32:53.265 --> 32:54.808
That's what it's all about.

32:55.392 --> 32:58.478
And so, if you want to get
the maximum out of your life,

32:58.562 --> 33:00.147
it's really your choice.

33:00.981 --> 33:03.108
Laird, I could've lost my life that day.

33:03.192 --> 33:06.069
You ushered me through
the most pivotal moment of my life.

33:06.153 --> 33:08.906
I only hope to do the same
for someone else.

33:08.989 --> 33:10.908
Instead of denying my illness,

33:10.991 --> 33:14.036
I find the greatest victories
in enjoying the sweetness of life.

33:14.119 --> 33:15.579
The ride's not always fun,

33:15.662 --> 33:19.583
but if you stand up tall, you learn
how to truly believe in yourself.

33:19.666 --> 33:21.210
And that's a beautiful thing.

33:21.293 --> 33:24.922
In a crazy world, that's something
to hold on to, something to cherish.

33:25.631 --> 33:27.090
You carved your own path,

33:27.174 --> 33:29.760
and you made me realize
I could do the same.

33:31.053 --> 33:34.556
I learned anything is possible
with the right set of tools

33:35.182 --> 33:36.808
and a mindset that won't give up.

33:37.392 --> 33:41.271
When you face your challenges
time and time again, you're rewarded.

33:41.897 --> 33:43.232
Sincerely, Aaron.

33:43.857 --> 33:45.984
Yours truly, Jeb.

33:46.068 --> 33:48.195
Sincerely, Emma.

33:48.278 --> 33:50.239
Sincerely, Martin.
