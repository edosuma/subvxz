- I'm down here [bleep]
cooking. What the [bleep]?

33:46.190 --> 33:48.357
- Bitch, I know your messy ass
did that [bleep].

33:48.357 --> 33:50.273
- Why the [bleep]
would I squirt toothpaste

33:50.273 --> 33:51.190
all over the [bleep] floor?

33:51.190 --> 33:52.357
- 'Cause you messy.
You and Gus.

33:52.357 --> 33:53.899
Y'all like to play pranks.
Y'all messy as [bleep].

33:53.899 --> 33:54.982
- I'm down here
[bleep] cooking.

33:54.982 --> 33:56.231
- You know, to be honest
with you, I don't think

33:56.231 --> 33:57.690
there's any chance
at all that this prank goes

33:57.690 --> 33:59.148
and there's not one
kind of problem.

33:59.148 --> 34:02.147
Like, let's be real.

34:02.147 --> 34:06.066
- All right, Aimee,
I'm going to bed.

34:06.066 --> 34:10.690
- All right, I love you.

34:10.690 --> 34:12.482
- Hey. You awake?
Hey.

34:12.482 --> 34:14.357
We're going to get the goats.
You want in on this, right?

34:14.357 --> 34:16.440
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right, come on.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.273
We're going to get them.

34:17.273 --> 34:19.398
- So the guys wake up
and they say,

34:19.398 --> 34:20.649
"Hey, we about
to do the goat prank."

34:20.649 --> 34:22.899
And I'm like,
"Oh, [bleep] yeah."

34:22.899 --> 34:27.147
- Let me--let me pad up.
Oh, yeah.

34:27.147 --> 34:30.690
- Well, listen.
They woke me up.

34:30.690 --> 34:33.190
- Look at him.
- They woke me up

34:33.190 --> 34:34.147
to get the goats out.

34:34.147 --> 34:37.147
<i>- Hopefully it goes as
smoothly as we think it will.</i>

34:37.147 --> 34:40.690
But here. Put it in.
Tripodic trio, and the [bleep]

34:40.690 --> 34:42.147
GOAT of all pranks.
Let's get it, baby.

34:42.147 --> 34:43.857
- All right, what are
we doing with this?

34:43.857 --> 34:44.982
- We got to barricade the door

34:44.982 --> 34:46.147
after we get the goats
in there,

34:46.147 --> 34:47.398
so they can't get out.
So we'll use--

34:47.398 --> 34:50.857
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, of course.

34:50.857 --> 34:53.815
- Ahh.

34:53.815 --> 34:54.899
- I got goat treats outside.

34:54.899 --> 34:57.565
- I know, but this--
- Hey, go.

34:57.565 --> 35:00.190
It's prank time, not eat time.
After the prank.

35:00.190 --> 35:01.147
- I didn't get to eat any.

35:01.147 --> 35:04.147
The plan is, I'm gonna lure
the goats to us.

35:04.147 --> 35:07.857
You know, we got goat treats.
Where's the goat food at?

35:07.857 --> 35:08.649
- Right here, right here.

35:08.649 --> 35:10.732
- 'Cause Gus says, if you get
one of them out,

35:10.732 --> 35:12.066
the other one will just follow.

35:12.066 --> 35:15.690
Come on, goat, goat,
goat, goat.

35:15.690 --> 35:17.147
- Codi, don't let him
run that way.

35:17.147 --> 35:18.066
- I got some treats.

35:18.066 --> 35:23.147
I got some treats for you.
I got some treats for you.

35:23.147 --> 35:24.147
- Damn it. [bleep].

35:24.147 --> 35:28.066
- Wrangling these goats
is a lot harder than I thought.

35:28.066 --> 35:28.940
- Damn it.
- Codi.

35:28.940 --> 35:30.147
- Codi, you gotta [bleep]
[inaudible].

35:30.147 --> 35:32.190
- God damn it. These goats
didn't want to play ball.

35:32.190 --> 35:35.899
I think I'm stepping
in goat [bleep].

35:35.899 --> 35:39.398
- Hey. I almost feel bad
that I'm a part of this now,

35:39.398 --> 35:41.899
because...guilty
by association now,

35:41.899 --> 35:45.024
so I feel like,
if the girls get mad tomorrow

35:45.024 --> 35:48.649
I'm gonna have to
at least come clean.

35:48.649 --> 35:51.398
- God damn it.
- [laughs]

35:51.398 --> 35:52.565
- So close.

35:52.565 --> 35:54.147
[laughter]

35:54.147 --> 35:55.649
<i>- I'm not sure what Codi's
thinking right now.</i>

35:55.649 --> 35:58.147
The original plan was to go out
to the backyard and, like,

35:58.147 --> 36:01.273
<i>lead the goats into the house
with some treats.</i>

36:01.273 --> 36:02.357
- Oh!
<i>- Now, he's trying</i>

36:02.357 --> 36:04.147
<i>to run around as fast
as he can with this helmet on.</i>

36:04.147 --> 36:07.147
You know, this has turned into,
like, a whole just comedy show,

36:07.147 --> 36:09.565
basically, at this point.

36:09.565 --> 36:10.357
- Oh, [bleep].

36:10.357 --> 36:13.190
- God damn it; I'm the only
one [bleep] trying over here.

36:13.190 --> 36:15.899
- That's the funniest [bleep]
I've ever seen.

36:15.899 --> 36:20.147
- I'm the only one trying.

36:20.147 --> 36:21.815
- It got to a point where I was
like, you know what?

36:21.815 --> 36:26.357
This prank's not gonna happen.
We just gotta give up, bruh.

36:26.357 --> 36:29.607
Hey. Hey.

36:29.607 --> 36:30.523
- Got him. I got him.

36:30.523 --> 36:32.147
- Oh, you got him.
You do got him.

36:32.147 --> 36:34.190
- You think you can pick him
up or no?

36:34.190 --> 36:36.482
- Maybe.
But he might start kicking me.

36:36.482 --> 36:38.190
You know, we want to be
as mindful as possible

36:38.190 --> 36:39.273
with this prank.
I want this to be

36:39.273 --> 36:40.899
all fun and games
and not actually somebody

36:40.899 --> 36:43.815
getting hurt, you know,
the goats or people.

36:43.815 --> 36:47.147
- There we--oh, perfect.
- I thought he pissed on me.

36:47.147 --> 36:49.066
- It's okay. It's okay.

36:49.066 --> 36:50.649
<i>- I think the girls
are probably gonna be mad.</i>

36:50.649 --> 36:53.482
So, you know, fingers crossed
that it doesn't turn

36:53.482 --> 36:54.607
into World War III from this,

36:54.607 --> 36:57.440
but my hopes
aren't necessarily too high.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.482
<i>[laughs]</i>

36:59.482 --> 37:02.690
<i>[tense music]</i>

37:02.690 --> 37:04.565
- Ahh! Ahh!

37:04.565 --> 37:10.857
- [laughs]
- Ahh!

37:10.857 --> 37:12.815
What the [bleep]?

37:12.815 --> 37:17.857
[laughter]

37:21.706 --> 37:22.773
<b>- <i>Ahh!</i></b>

37:22.840 --> 37:24.809

<b>- Ahh! Ahh!</b>

37:29.680 --> 37:31.516

37:31.582 --> 37:32.984
<b>- Oh, [bleep].</b>

37:33.050 --> 37:35.119
<b>- [laughs]</b>

37:35.186 --> 37:37.054
<b>- Ahh!</b>

37:37.121 --> 37:39.657
<b><i>My track skills came in handy.</i></b>
<b><i>I dipped out that bitch.</i></b>

37:39.724 --> 37:41.826
<b>No. Goats?</b>

37:41.893 --> 37:44.595
<b>[laughter]</b>

37:44.662 --> 37:45.897

37:45.963 --> 37:50.902
<b>[laughter]</b>

37:50.968 --> 37:52.270
<b>[bleep].</b>

37:52.336 --> 37:55.740
<b>- Where is it? Is it gone?</b>

37:55.806 --> 37:57.909
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

37:57.975 --> 37:59.977
<b>Why would you</b>
<b>put goats in my room?</b>

38:00.044 --> 38:03.481
<b>Why? Explain your logic.</b>
<b>There is no logic.</b>

38:03.548 --> 38:04.582
<b>You did it to be an asshole.</b>

38:10.154 --> 38:12.456
<b>[horn honks]</b>

38:12.523 --> 38:17.328
<b>- Oh, God, we lost a goat.</b>
<b>God damn it.</b>

38:17.395 --> 38:18.996
<b>We let the goats loose</b>
<b>in the house,</b>

38:19.063 --> 38:21.165
<b>and they're all over the place.</b>
<b>We don't know where they're at.</b>

38:21.232 --> 38:23.534
<b>[bleep] it, we don't know</b>
<b>where they're at.</b>

38:23.601 --> 38:24.702

<b>I know you said you didn't want</b>

38:54.832 --> 38:58.135
