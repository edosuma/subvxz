WEBVTT

00:23.423 --> 00:25.626
[Scarecrow] Oh, crazy about
Joker and Harley.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.495
I heard they tried
an open relationship thing,

00:27.495 --> 00:29.297
which everybody knows
only works for gay men.

00:29.329 --> 00:33.533
Your idle gossip distracts me
from my master plan.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.069
Break the Batman.

00:35.101 --> 00:37.472
Punish Gotham
for its transgressions,

00:37.505 --> 00:41.042
and stand atop
the mountain of skulls

00:41.075 --> 00:44.145
left in my wake.

00:44.177 --> 00:47.582
-Anyway, I heard Harley--
-[Joker] Morning.

00:47.615 --> 00:50.884
-How are you?
-Fine. Why wouldn't I be?

00:50.917 --> 00:53.887
Because Harley dumped you.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.189
You know?

00:55.189 --> 00:58.158
People are saying
that Harley dumped me?

00:58.192 --> 01:01.341
[laughing menacingly]

01:05.099 --> 01:08.069
Please! You know what?
I don't even care.

01:08.102 --> 01:12.638
I wish her well.

01:12.673 --> 01:13.941
[Harley] Ivy, no rush,

01:13.974 --> 01:15.909
but Howie Mandel's only showing

01:15.942 --> 01:18.144
how to turn
Thanksgiving leftovers

01:18.179 --> 01:20.781
into an entire
nativity scene.

01:20.813 --> 01:22.450
Oh, my God! Wait, what?

01:22.450 --> 01:24.084
[Poison Ivy] Hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.552
<i>Next, I'm gonna show you</i>

01:25.587 --> 01:27.691
<i>how to make</i>
<i>a mashed potato Virgin Mary.</i>

01:27.724 --> 01:29.956
But first,
[chuckles nervously]

01:29.989 --> 01:32.561
please welcome
my, uh, surprise co-host.

01:32.596 --> 01:36.631
Uh, you know him
as the clown prince of crime.

01:36.664 --> 01:39.533
-Let's give it up
for the Joker!
-[audience gasping]

01:39.566 --> 01:41.001
[laughing]

01:41.034 --> 01:42.135
-Shit!
-Damn it.

01:42.168 --> 01:43.772
-Ooh.
-Get ready, America.

01:43.805 --> 01:47.042
Howie's got something
he's dying to tell you.

01:47.075 --> 01:49.343
-[audience screaming]
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Not Howie!

01:49.376 --> 01:51.144
You know what's stupid?

01:51.177 --> 01:54.415
Me, for playfully implying
on yesterday's show that

01:54.448 --> 01:55.917
the celebrity villain couple,

01:55.950 --> 01:58.986
<i>formerly known as "JoQuinn"</i>
<i>is no more.</i>

01:59.019 --> 02:00.320
Thanks, Howie.

02:00.353 --> 02:02.590
When I dumped poor, sad,
what's her name...

02:02.623 --> 02:04.158
-She's right over here.
-Frank.

02:04.191 --> 02:06.192
I promised I would
respect her wishes

02:06.227 --> 02:09.597
to drift into the darkness
of total anonymity.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.532
And for the record,
our couple name was...

02:12.567 --> 02:15.402
<i>-"Joker."</i>
-Oh, that liar
trying to blow up

02:15.402 --> 02:17.741
the cleanest and nicest
talk show host in television!

02:17.774 --> 02:19.939
Just ignore him.
He's baiting you.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.508
It's not worth
getting angry over.

02:21.542 --> 02:24.211
Sorry, but that's all the time
<i>we have today, Howie.</i>

02:24.245 --> 02:26.013
<i>And speaking of time,</i>

02:26.045 --> 02:28.081
<i>yours is running out.</i>

02:28.115 --> 02:29.349
[audience screaming]

02:29.383 --> 02:30.883
I need a very brave
wardrobe girl!

02:30.918 --> 02:32.218
-[laughing viciously]
-[grunts]

02:32.252 --> 02:33.587
Jesus, Harls.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.222
This is why I don't put
the good TV out.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.925
Good TV?
Where you hiding that bad boy?

02:36.957 --> 02:40.026
If he thinks I'm just gonna
fade away into obscurity,

02:40.026 --> 02:41.194
he doesn't know
what's coming.

02:41.194 --> 02:42.729
Who cares?
You're doing great.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.800
You got a killer new outfit,
you started meditating.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.033
I haven't started yet.
I just downloaded the app.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.235
That's a first step.

02:48.235 --> 02:49.704
You're a strong,
independent woman

02:49.704 --> 02:51.305
who doesn't care
what other people think.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.873
Right! Who cares what Joker

02:52.873 --> 02:54.942
and his stupid
Legion of Doom buddies think.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.677
-Exactly!
-Preach!

02:56.711 --> 02:59.180
Hell, I'll show them in person
how little I care.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.914
What? No. What are you doing?

03:00.949 --> 03:03.450
-Logging into Joker's calendar.
-Oh, God, we're off the rails.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.786
No, let it play out.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.586
Oh, hey, there's a party
at the Gotham Mint

03:06.621 --> 03:08.489
with the Legion of Doom guys
tomorrow!

03:08.522 --> 03:10.757
Oh, if he wants
to fuck with me in public,

03:10.790 --> 03:12.225
I will fuck right back!

03:12.225 --> 03:14.027
-Please do not do this.
-Please do that shit.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.262
I'm just gonna show those guys

03:15.295 --> 03:16.663
how awesome I'm doing
without him.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.099
It'll be so fun!

03:18.133 --> 03:20.769
And you can meet a hot guy
and use your cool love potion.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.538
This isn't a love potion.
It's my distilled pheromones.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.239
It makes men
infatuated with me

03:25.239 --> 03:27.212
and then kills them
by turning them into plants.

03:27.212 --> 03:28.543
[both] Right, a love potion.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.378
-Please come with me. Please!
-No.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.181
-Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.
-Stop.

03:33.181 --> 03:36.250
-Frank, shut up.
Saying no again.
-Do it. Do it. Do it.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.752
What? Stop saying "do it."

03:37.752 --> 03:39.019
[Frank and Harley chanting]
Do it, do it, do it.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.455
-Fine.
-[Frank] Yes.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.090
-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh, shit. Howie exploded.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.061
-[Ivy and Frank] No!
-Not Howie.

03:45.093 --> 03:48.462
-Joker, you son of a bitch!
-That's my phone, uh...

03:48.496 --> 03:51.645
[theme music playing]

04:00.873 --> 04:02.223
[roaring]

04:19.125 --> 04:23.326
[man coughs] [clears throat]

04:28.569 --> 04:30.771
[man clears throat]

04:30.803 --> 04:33.807
[roaring]

04:33.841 --> 04:36.646
Did you know that this party
was for children?

04:36.680 --> 04:38.980
I do now.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.982
Although, technically,
one boy becomes a man today.

04:40.982 --> 04:44.151
Are you one of the dancers
for my nephew's bar mitzvah?

04:44.185 --> 04:45.952
Jesus, Harley!

04:45.985 --> 04:47.454
[laughing]

04:47.487 --> 04:50.257
Rock bottom came fast
as the Joker dumped you.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.826
Uh, she dumped him,

04:51.860 --> 04:53.863
and you smell like
shrimp shit. Excuse us.

04:53.896 --> 04:55.730
-We should leave.
-No, no, no, no, no.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.298
All the Legion bigwigs
are here.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.632
I came to show 'em how great

04:58.665 --> 05:00.434
I'm doing
and I am gonna!

05:00.468 --> 05:02.235
This isn't
your coming out party.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.805
It's a 13-year-old boy's
coming out party.

05:03.805 --> 05:05.439
Look, a lot of people made

05:05.439 --> 05:06.708
a name for themselves
at parties.

05:06.708 --> 05:08.274
Bane, he decided to blow up

05:08.309 --> 05:10.276
Gotham Stadium
during Trivia Night.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.812
[Bane] Oh, the Dallas Cowboys.

05:12.846 --> 05:13.980
Incorrect.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.216
The Steelers have won

05:15.249 --> 05:16.850
the most games
at Gotham Stadium.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.420
I'm gonna blow up
Gotham Stadium.

05:19.452 --> 05:21.089
Fine, just don't
leave me alone.

05:21.089 --> 05:24.024
Or some like D-list villain
will hit on me

05:24.057 --> 05:25.560
or ask to do a heist with me

05:25.593 --> 05:28.495
and the longer we wait...
Okay, she's gone.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.398
[whispering] Kite Man.

05:30.430 --> 05:33.233
What? What was that? Whoa.
[laughs]

05:33.266 --> 05:38.238
Did I just hear the wind
say "Kite Man?"

05:38.271 --> 05:39.973
I think you're alone in that.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.141
Hell yeah!

05:41.175 --> 05:43.142
Good God.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.812
I need a permit
for a trap door?

05:45.846 --> 05:46.848
The whole point is

05:46.880 --> 05:48.516
no one is supposed
to know about it!

05:48.548 --> 05:50.117
Especially the City.

05:50.149 --> 05:52.519
I need this lair rebuilt now.

05:52.552 --> 05:53.922
[cell phone ringing]

05:53.922 --> 05:55.555
Knock, knock, who's there?
It's me, Joker.

05:55.555 --> 05:58.358
You will never guess
who's at the bar mitzvah.

05:58.391 --> 05:59.894
Jesus, Bane!

05:59.927 --> 06:03.129
I don't have time
for a guessing game. Hang on.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.399
Those shoes have black soles!

06:05.432 --> 06:06.834
Put plastic booties on.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.803
Harley is at Penguin's nephew's
bar mitzvah.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.639
She crashed
the stupid thing?

06:11.672 --> 06:14.442
Yeah, seems like
she's doing pretty well.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.711
Brought a tiger. Pretty cool.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.312
What? Anyone can buy a tiger.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.247
You know she has HPV, right?

06:21.281 --> 06:24.184
Most sexually active adults do.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.817
Shut up! I'm on my way.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.656
[Harley] Uh-oh!
Who are these troublemakers?

06:29.689 --> 06:32.293
Nah, I'm just kidding.
I know it's you, Scarecrow,

06:32.326 --> 06:34.163
Two-Face,
other half of Two-Face,

06:34.196 --> 06:35.495
[imitating Bane] Bane.

06:35.528 --> 06:36.764
[all laughing]

06:36.798 --> 06:39.000
I'm going to blow up
this bar mitzvah.

06:39.033 --> 06:41.668
Quinn, great to see you.
Where you been hiding?

06:41.702 --> 06:43.836
On your left,
where you can't see shit.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.240
[all laughing]

06:45.273 --> 06:48.108
So, guess who has a plan
to finally get rid of Batman?

06:48.141 --> 06:50.343
Ya girl.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.446
[Joker] Look
who's' trying to run

06:52.480 --> 06:53.581
before she can crawl.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.449
[all laughing nervously]

06:55.483 --> 06:56.651
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

06:56.684 --> 06:58.819
-Jesus.
-Glad you're here, J-Man.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.620
Pull up a chair.
Doesn't bother me.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.622
So, who's goin' beef
and who's goin' chicken?

07:02.656 --> 07:04.358
You are going
somewhere else.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.560
Because this is
the Legion of Doom table!

07:06.593 --> 07:09.497
Why don't you go find
the Crazy Bitch table?

07:09.529 --> 07:11.632
Spoiler:
It's not a real table.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.300
-That was implied!
-[groaning]

07:13.334 --> 07:17.271
Who wants to ditch this jester
and tear up Gotham with me?

07:17.303 --> 07:20.341
[laughs menacingly]

07:20.374 --> 07:21.608
Laugh. Laugh with me.

07:21.641 --> 07:24.144
[all laughing nervously]

07:24.177 --> 07:25.747
You know what? Who needs ya?

07:25.779 --> 07:30.779
This table's too far away
from the dance floor anyway.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.887
Ugh, can you believe
those assholes?

07:33.922 --> 07:35.757
You know what?
I don't need 'em.
I'll sit with you guys.

07:35.790 --> 07:39.627
Uh, no. This is
the Joshua best friends' table.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.362
Unless, you're the girl

07:41.394 --> 07:42.930
that Joshua
fingerbanged at Camp.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.699
If I said yes,
would you let me sit here?

07:44.732 --> 07:48.735
Trick question. Joshua has
never fingerbanged anyone.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.170
Ha!

07:50.204 --> 07:54.007
So, Ivy-Ivy-Bo-Bivy.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.877
Um, let me ask you
a personal question.

07:55.910 --> 07:59.178
Have you ever seen
Gotham Central Park...

07:59.213 --> 08:02.117
-From the sky?
-From the sky!

08:02.117 --> 08:03.552
Yeah, you get it.
Okay, you know, I was thinking,

08:03.552 --> 08:06.387
you and I should do
a heist together.

08:06.420 --> 08:07.956
Uh, you know what?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.891
I'm just really kinda worn out
from all the heist stuff.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.358
It's just kinda hard
being such

08:12.392 --> 08:14.060
a weak woman
and whatnot.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.495
Yeah. I bet.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.298
Um, but, hey,
I'll do all the heavy-lifting.

08:17.298 --> 08:18.531
You don't have to break a nail.

08:18.531 --> 08:21.235
It'll be a breeze.

08:21.267 --> 08:22.637
-Breeze.
-Yeah.

08:22.637 --> 08:24.103
It's just 'cause my powers
are wind-based.

08:24.103 --> 08:25.338
You don't have powers!

08:25.338 --> 08:26.807
You just have a kite
like every kid

08:26.807 --> 08:28.608
in every park
across the world.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.076
And she doesn't want
to do a heist with you

08:30.076 --> 08:31.512
'cause you're stupid!

08:31.545 --> 08:36.017
-Do you think I'm stupid?
-I mean, don't you?

08:36.049 --> 08:38.320
These assholes always pretended
to be my friends.

08:38.352 --> 08:41.655
But they're really just...
[screaming] assholes!

08:41.688 --> 08:43.389
They think
I am not in their league,

08:43.423 --> 08:45.493
[screaming]
but they don't know shit!

08:45.525 --> 08:47.761
Hi, girls.
So glad you could come.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.730
I know we're all evil here,

08:49.764 --> 08:51.798
but maybe we could
put a little sugar

08:51.832 --> 08:53.533
on that salty language,

08:53.533 --> 08:54.567
you know, for the kids.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.470
Sorry, Mrs. Cobblepot.

08:56.504 --> 08:57.971
Yeah, never again. Sorry.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.440
Dude, we got to
get the fuck out of here.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.908
Hell, no. I'm not giving up.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.409
I'll show these Legion guys

09:03.443 --> 09:05.412
I can do something
not even they can!

09:05.412 --> 09:06.980
[Harley] What's one thing
in this room,

09:06.980 --> 09:09.049
none of them
ever had the balls to try?

09:09.082 --> 09:11.485
-[Poison Ivy] The fruit salad?
-[sneezes]

09:11.519 --> 09:12.620
Even worse.

09:12.653 --> 09:15.254
I'm gonna rob the Gotham Mint.

09:15.288 --> 09:19.091
Oh.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.894
No cuts!

09:20.927 --> 09:22.830
All right, Stop.
Let's get real for a second.

09:22.864 --> 09:25.198
The Gotham Mint
is impenetrable.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.701
They're so confident,

09:26.734 --> 09:29.070
they rented the atrium out
to the Legion of Doom.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.638
Look, I'm doing this thing,
all right?

09:30.638 --> 09:31.972
-What if Batman shows up?
-I'll kill him.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.774
-Where's the getaway car?
-I'll steal one.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.543
-Where will you put
all the money?
-Look around.

09:35.543 --> 09:36.811
Every kid's wearing a backpack.

09:36.811 --> 09:38.046
Gah! Look, Ivy,

09:38.046 --> 09:39.580
all the reasons you said
it can't work

09:39.613 --> 09:41.182
are exactly the reasons
I gotta do it!

09:41.216 --> 09:42.984
They might not like me,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.618
but they will respect
the shit out of me.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.687
All right, fine. Just go.
Go steal the money.

09:46.721 --> 09:49.155
Just do me one favor, okay?
Don't leave me alone here,

09:49.188 --> 09:50.289
because... Oh!

09:50.323 --> 09:52.494
Party's a drag, huh?

09:52.494 --> 09:55.523
[raspy voice] I really
should quit, but, I just can't.

09:55.523 --> 09:56.730
Go away, fragile child.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.068
Hey, how about we ditch
this shindig

09:59.101 --> 10:03.035
and sneak into
a PG-13 movie?

10:03.070 --> 10:04.304
[all grunting]

10:04.337 --> 10:05.773
My love potion?

10:05.807 --> 10:09.442
I stole your juice
and I gave it to these kids.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.645
-Hell yeah!
-You're an idiot.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.847
Ooh, you mispronounced
"genius."

10:13.880 --> 10:17.150
No, that potion makes people
fall in love with me

10:17.150 --> 10:18.153
and then kills them.

10:18.153 --> 10:20.287
-What?
-Yes! What did you think,

10:20.321 --> 10:21.423
you kite-fucking freak?

10:21.423 --> 10:23.658
My name is Poison Ivy.

10:23.691 --> 10:26.259
Damn! See, this is why
I stick to the kites.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.462
So simple.

10:28.496 --> 10:30.563
Ha!

10:30.597 --> 10:31.932
[Harley grunts]

10:31.965 --> 10:33.033
[grunts]

10:33.067 --> 10:36.604
The vault must be
around here somewhere.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.436
[yelps]

10:41.274 --> 10:42.274
Bingo.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.626
-[grunts]
-[grunting in pain]

10:59.659 --> 11:03.831
[grunts]

11:03.865 --> 11:07.869
[guard screaming]

11:07.902 --> 11:10.937
[Harley grunts]

11:10.971 --> 11:13.207
We gotta get an antidote
before these kids die.

11:13.207 --> 11:14.376
It's in my apartment
across town,

11:14.376 --> 11:16.076
so we need to get there quick.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.778
Quick as a kite?

11:17.812 --> 11:19.513
-Oh, God.
-Weather permitting.

11:19.547 --> 11:20.780
Fine, hit the button.

11:20.815 --> 11:22.216
Is it raining out?

11:22.216 --> 11:23.783
It looked a little overcast
when I came in.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.653
Oh, shut the fuck up.
Let's go.

11:25.686 --> 11:26.953
...look at
my phone here.

11:26.988 --> 11:28.621
No, I think we're good.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.524
[girl screaming]

11:30.557 --> 11:33.027
Ugh! My chicken is rubbery.

11:33.061 --> 11:34.695
Mmm, your beef looks good.

11:34.729 --> 11:36.931
Uh, fine.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.267
Ah, ah, I might finish that.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.568
Oh, well, then,
what are we doing?

11:41.601 --> 11:43.470
Hey, everybody,
let's give it up

11:43.504 --> 11:45.740
for Joshua's
bar mitzvah, huh?

11:45.773 --> 11:46.774
[all applauding]

11:46.807 --> 11:48.842
It was very special for me.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.311
It was when I realized
it was my dream

11:51.345 --> 11:52.546
to become a crime lord.

11:52.580 --> 11:54.115
-[all] Aw.
-[sniffles]

11:54.148 --> 11:57.784
So today, I force that dream
on to you.

11:57.817 --> 11:59.986
[crowd cheering]

12:00.020 --> 12:02.123
[guard wincing in pain]

12:02.155 --> 12:03.557
[Penguin]
<i>Okay, Joshua</i> ...

12:03.591 --> 12:05.725
Get ready for your first caper.

12:05.759 --> 12:08.361
<i>Good luck fighting off</i>
<i>the guards,</i>

12:08.394 --> 12:09.697

12:09.730 --> 12:13.201

12:17.804 --> 12:19.339
Joshua Bucks?

12:19.373 --> 12:20.374
Oh, no!

12:20.407 --> 12:23.711
Go, Joshua... Oh, my God!

12:23.744 --> 12:27.081
Hey, Joshy,
<i>mazel tov.</i>

12:27.115 --> 12:30.317
-[man screaming]
-[laughing menacingly]

12:30.350 --> 12:31.918
This is fantastic.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.388
You're probably
not laughing

12:33.421 --> 12:35.755
because this is sort of
how you screw up.

12:35.789 --> 12:36.789
[Bane groans]

12:36.789 --> 12:39.461
-You ruined the bar mitzvah.
-[crowd booing]

12:39.461 --> 12:42.096
-And crippled
an improv troupe!
-Meh. Well.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.597
And that's our show, folks!

12:44.631 --> 12:49.070
-I got this.
-[gun cocking]

12:49.102 --> 12:50.738
Say good night, puddin'.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.706
You think [panting]
this is gonna...

12:53.740 --> 12:56.410
[voice breaking] stop me?

12:56.443 --> 12:59.647
[Joker laughs]
She even sounds like you.

12:59.679 --> 13:02.152
Oh, I don't think...
Do I sound like...

13:02.184 --> 13:04.884
[Bane] You never hear
your own voice, I guess.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.811
-[laughing menacingly]
-[Harley groans]

13:08.822 --> 13:10.057
Sometimes, I just fly

13:10.091 --> 13:11.926
to have a quiet place
to think.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.561
You know, just really let
my thoughts just run wild.

13:14.595 --> 13:17.144
Thoughts? Plural?

13:22.144 --> 13:23.837
[Poison Ivy] All right,
I'll get the antidote.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.941
And you know, just don't,
like, touch anything.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.524
Uh... [muttering]

13:33.147 --> 13:35.349
All right, let's boogie.

13:35.381 --> 13:36.750
Kite Man?

13:36.783 --> 13:37.833
Oh, no.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.460
Kite Man. Hell yeah!

13:46.493 --> 13:47.660
What are you doing?

13:47.695 --> 13:50.096
Getting ready to have sex.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.129
Why?

13:51.129 --> 13:55.302
Because after a great date,
you usually have sex.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.337
[laughing]

13:57.371 --> 13:59.274
Sorry, sorry.
I was gonna say something,

13:59.307 --> 14:01.542
but I wanted to see
how all this played out.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.278
-Oh, shut up, Frank.
-Ooh!

14:03.278 --> 14:04.913
I'm gonna need you to
put your clothes back on

14:04.913 --> 14:06.813
because this was not a date.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.783
Excuse me,
if this wasn't a date,

14:08.783 --> 14:10.765
why did you bring me back
to your place?

14:10.765 --> 14:11.736
For the antidote!

14:11.736 --> 14:13.455
Oh, I thought
that was just a line.

14:13.455 --> 14:15.322
-Why would I use
a line on you?
-I don't know!

14:15.322 --> 14:16.890
I mean why would you
even have me come?

14:16.890 --> 14:18.259
I mean, a cab
would've been faster.

14:18.259 --> 14:19.327
You know it, I know it,
we all know it.

14:19.327 --> 14:21.796
Jesus, get dressed.

14:21.828 --> 14:26.100
[heart beating]

14:26.134 --> 14:30.804
["Hava Nagila" playing]

14:30.837 --> 14:33.374
Cut the song.
No Horah for Harley.

14:33.408 --> 14:36.210
Hey, it's gonna take
more than a souped up parasol

14:36.210 --> 14:37.577
to keep me
from kicking your ass,

14:37.577 --> 14:38.778
you fat flightless bird.

14:38.812 --> 14:40.380
The mouth on her.

14:40.414 --> 14:42.283
What better way
to become a man than by--

14:42.317 --> 14:44.421
Ooh, than touching
your umbrella? Whoo.

14:44.453 --> 14:49.355
Yes, I've been waiting
for this!

14:49.389 --> 14:50.625
Any last words

14:50.625 --> 14:54.928
before I kill your dumb blonde,
stupid, smelly...

14:54.928 --> 14:56.462
[whispering]
That's too many adjectives.

14:56.462 --> 14:57.999
...idiot ass?

14:58.032 --> 15:00.000
Hey, Joshua,
make sure you aim it

15:00.033 --> 15:01.101
directly at my head,

15:01.134 --> 15:02.336
'cause you don't want to miss

15:02.370 --> 15:04.038
in front of your friends
and family.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.538
I won't miss.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.974
I don't know.

15:07.008 --> 15:09.809
That trembly finger's telling
a different story.

15:09.844 --> 15:11.211
It's not trembly.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.847
I just... I've never shot
an umbrella before.

15:12.847 --> 15:15.381
I bet there are a lot of things
that you've never done

15:15.414 --> 15:16.951
like drunk a beer.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.888
I drunk a beer,
like all the time.

15:18.921 --> 15:20.888
I always drunk beers.

15:20.921 --> 15:23.256
I bet you still believe
in Santy Claus.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.693
I don't! I'm Jewish
and today, I'm a man.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.028
Oh, that's right,

15:28.062 --> 15:30.631
I forgot I'm talking to
a newly grown man.

15:30.664 --> 15:33.767
I mean, after all,
you've already
fingerbanged somebody.

15:33.801 --> 15:35.202
[crowd gasps]

15:35.235 --> 15:37.337
-Wait, what?
-I mean, you have, haven't you?

15:37.371 --> 15:40.341
You didn't lie about such
an important milestone, right?

15:40.375 --> 15:45.375
-Yeah, it happened.
-Are you sure?

15:45.778 --> 15:48.259
[stuttering]
I... I don't know.

15:51.118 --> 15:55.155
So, um, obviously,
I misread some signals.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.188
[Poison Ivy] Mm-hmm.

15:56.188 --> 15:58.158
I hope me taking off my clothes
didn't come across as...

15:58.158 --> 16:00.163
Creepy? It did. It didn't. Did.

16:00.163 --> 16:03.464
Right. Yeah, no. I apologize.

16:03.498 --> 16:07.182
It's just, I have never been
alone with a woman

16:07.182 --> 16:08.469
of your caliber.

16:08.503 --> 16:11.572
-Oh, you don't have to--
-Your eyes, your smile...

16:11.605 --> 16:14.241
Your silky, shimmering...

16:14.274 --> 16:15.543
Oh, God.
You know what?

16:15.576 --> 16:18.349
Strong woman... osity?
The... [stutters]

16:18.381 --> 16:22.015
I'm gonna be
quiet for a while.

16:22.048 --> 16:25.652
[Poison Ivy] You know,
it is kind of cool

16:25.686 --> 16:27.020
seeing the park from the sky.

16:27.053 --> 16:29.423
I mean,
when you're not talking,

16:29.456 --> 16:32.793
and we're just kinda
soaring majestically,

16:32.826 --> 16:34.095
you're not so bad.

16:34.128 --> 16:35.628
Hell yeah.

16:40.734 --> 16:41.936
Oh, shit.

16:41.936 --> 16:43.203
Something's going on
down there.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.572
[stuttering]
I... I don't know.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.975
It was at camp, at night.

16:48.009 --> 16:50.043
It was me and her
and it was dark.

16:50.076 --> 16:51.979
I definitely did something.

16:52.013 --> 16:54.081
Oh, Joshy.

16:54.115 --> 16:56.717
Do you really think
you're ready to kill someone

16:56.750 --> 17:01.488
if you've never even
finger blasted a girl?

17:01.522 --> 17:02.990
[grunts] You're right.

17:03.024 --> 17:04.325
I'm not ready.

17:04.358 --> 17:05.759
-[Joshua sobbing]
-[crowd gasping]

17:05.759 --> 17:07.627
I told you we should've
gotten him the dollhouse

17:07.627 --> 17:08.929
like he asked, Oswald.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.798
It's not a doll house!

17:10.830 --> 17:12.066
It's an army base

17:12.098 --> 17:14.402
with sound effects
of real screams

17:14.434 --> 17:16.403
and it's the only thing
I wanted!

17:16.436 --> 17:18.105
-You're dead, Quinn.
-[gun cocking]

17:18.138 --> 17:20.208
-[glass shattering]
-[grunting]

17:20.240 --> 17:22.410
[groaning] Hell, yeah!

17:22.442 --> 17:24.045
Hey, did they do cake yet?

17:24.077 --> 17:26.346
Not yet.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.481
[groans]

17:27.515 --> 17:29.282
I though that was gonna be
way cooler.

17:29.317 --> 17:30.817
[clears throat] Harley!

17:30.851 --> 17:32.118
You're not a solo act.

17:32.153 --> 17:34.422
You're a sidekick,
an afterthought.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.226
No one is ever going to
take you seriously.

17:36.259 --> 17:39.227
Admit you're nothing
without me

17:39.259 --> 17:41.028
and you walk away alive.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.596
Or you can die.

17:42.628 --> 17:45.066
[laughing menacingly]

17:45.098 --> 17:46.534
Well, easy choice.

17:46.567 --> 17:49.202
Uh, lovely bar mitzvah.
Mazel, mazel.

17:49.237 --> 17:50.738
-Are you leaving?
-Ha, no.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.406
I ain't admitting shit!

17:53.406 --> 17:54.406
Boys?

17:58.546 --> 18:00.513
-I got Two-Face.
-I got Scarecrow.

18:00.547 --> 18:01.882
I, um...

18:01.915 --> 18:02.916
Oh, dear God.

18:02.950 --> 18:04.185
Oh, wow.

18:04.219 --> 18:05.786
[grunting]

18:05.818 --> 18:08.021
You're looming.

18:08.055 --> 18:10.925
Um, all right, well,
I'll take, um...

18:10.959 --> 18:14.028
If you don't mind,
if you could scooch
just a little.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.230
Boom! On-site coordinator.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.531
Looking kinda brittle there.
Won't see it comi--

18:18.565 --> 18:20.134
[grunting]

18:20.166 --> 18:22.669
I wanna go home.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.202
[laughing]

18:31.412 --> 18:32.949
[shrieking] Ive, gun!

18:32.981 --> 18:34.815
Got it.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.285
Hey!

18:38.551 --> 18:42.890
[screaming]

18:42.923 --> 18:45.472
[crowd screaming]

18:54.301 --> 18:57.104
Let's get out of here.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.538
No, let's fight.
Maybe Kite Man can help.

18:59.573 --> 19:02.041
[grunting]

19:02.076 --> 19:03.443
Bane!

19:03.478 --> 19:05.679
Quit dicking around
with Kite Man

19:05.711 --> 19:06.779
and get those two.

19:06.814 --> 19:08.250
But he was attacking me.

19:08.282 --> 19:10.049
With what? A kite?

19:10.050 --> 19:13.554
Just do what I tell you,
you dumb, freakish monster.

19:13.587 --> 19:16.457
Bane, why are you letting him
talk to you like that?

19:16.490 --> 19:17.726
In fact, why do
any of you

19:17.759 --> 19:19.559
let him talk to you like that?

19:19.594 --> 19:21.362
He doesn't even have powers!

19:21.394 --> 19:24.565
His only power is bullying you
into doing what he wants.

19:24.565 --> 19:27.300
I should know.
He did it to me for years.

19:27.335 --> 19:30.069
Don't listen to her.
She's nothing!

19:30.104 --> 19:31.439
She makes a good point.

19:31.439 --> 19:33.740
I don't like
how you called me a monster.

19:33.775 --> 19:35.676
-Yeah, that was pretty harsh.
-Oh, yeah.

19:35.710 --> 19:38.112
Oh, my God!
It's just an expression.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.314
Also, let's talk
about dinner.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.182
I selected the beef
well in advance

19:42.215 --> 19:43.483
and you stole it from me.

19:43.518 --> 19:45.118
You said you didn't even

19:45.152 --> 19:47.488
want to come
to this "stupid thing."

19:47.521 --> 19:50.357
-[crowd gasps]
-[Bane] My feelings exactly.

19:50.391 --> 19:53.361
This is a monumental night
for young Joshua.

19:53.394 --> 19:55.996
I'm the Joker, all right?

19:55.996 --> 19:57.664
I was joking, okay?

19:57.699 --> 20:00.769
Oh, my God!
I'll kill Harley myself.

20:00.801 --> 20:04.271
Ivy, if you could just,
you know, move over,

20:04.271 --> 20:05.606
so I could just
kill your friend.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.209
Absolutely.
Over my dead body.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.644
Ugh! Female friendships.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.881
Ha!

20:13.913 --> 20:15.782
[snarling]

20:15.816 --> 20:16.865
[yelps]

20:22.056 --> 20:23.856
[cell phone ringing]

20:23.891 --> 20:25.292
Hold on. [chuckles]

20:25.326 --> 20:29.329
I'm getting a cell call
from my contractor.

20:29.363 --> 20:32.067
What? This is the Joker.
Come again. Yeah, whatever.

20:32.099 --> 20:35.169
What do you mean
they're not going
to start till 10:00?

20:35.201 --> 20:36.805
Ugh! Can you believe this?

20:36.837 --> 20:38.740
They're calling it
a residential zone.

20:38.772 --> 20:40.508
It's an
abandoned amusement park

20:40.540 --> 20:42.509
at the end of a rotting pier!

20:42.542 --> 20:46.980
[gasps] I'll, uh...
Yeah, coming over right now.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.249
Let's put a pin in this.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.683
You understand. [chuckles]

20:49.717 --> 20:51.586
-So, are we good to leave now?
-Yeah.

20:51.586 --> 20:53.320
I can't believe you talked me
into coming to this.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.191
Don't forget
your party favors.

20:55.223 --> 20:58.291
[both]
Thank you, Mrs. Cobblepot.

20:58.326 --> 21:01.862
Aw, such sweet girls.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.631
So, do you realize now

21:03.631 --> 21:05.132
that you don't have
to prove to anyone

21:05.132 --> 21:06.400
how awesome you are?

21:06.400 --> 21:07.836
Yes, except for
the Legion of Doom.

21:07.836 --> 21:10.237
I need to get into
the Legion of Doom.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.638
What? After all of this,

21:11.673 --> 21:13.508
why would you wanna be
a part of that club?

21:13.540 --> 21:15.209
Those guys are such dicks.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.711
No, not all of 'em.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.313
When we were leaving,
Bane said, "You go, girl!"

21:19.346 --> 21:21.849
No, he distinctly said,
"Ooh, Go-GURT.

21:21.883 --> 21:24.417
Ooh, what, they had Go-GURT?
Oh, man.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.621
Ivy, listen. Anyone who is
a respected supervillain

21:26.653 --> 21:28.122
is in the Legion of Doom.

21:28.122 --> 21:29.289
That's when you know
you've made it.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.358
If Joker can get in,
so can I!

21:31.392 --> 21:33.059
So that is what I'm gonna do.

21:33.093 --> 21:34.628
What you need to do

21:34.662 --> 21:37.030
is get these 13-year-old boys
out of this apartment.

21:37.064 --> 21:38.398
They're starting to take root.

21:38.432 --> 21:41.268
Ah! Okay, boys.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.470
So, I got the antidote

21:42.502 --> 21:44.471
to turn you back
into humans, okay?

21:44.505 --> 21:46.307
But the only effective way
of doing it

21:46.339 --> 21:50.109
is when
my saliva interacts...

21:50.144 --> 21:51.479
with your saliva.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.913
So, is this a kiss?

21:53.946 --> 21:55.583
No, it's not a kiss.

21:55.615 --> 21:58.951
It is an antidote
delivery system

21:58.986 --> 22:00.119
and nothing more.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.588
You will still be
sexless nerds

22:01.622 --> 22:04.191
by the time
the night is over, okay?

22:04.224 --> 22:07.594
And...

22:07.626 --> 22:09.896
Yuck.

22:09.930 --> 22:13.680
This is procedural, okay?

22:16.837 --> 22:18.271
Yeah, I kissed you
already, buddy.

22:18.305 --> 22:20.275
Yeah, I'm still
a little bit tree.

22:20.307 --> 22:23.309
-Yeah, fuck off,
get out of here.
-Yeah, fuck off, kid.

22:23.344 --> 22:28.344
