00:11.005 --> 00:13.805
All I'm saying is
I find it difficult to believe.

00:13.885 --> 00:16.045
But it's the truth, Mary.

00:16.125 --> 00:17.925
- Really?
- Honest to God.

00:18.005 --> 00:21.365
So, if I was to go next door and open
that washing basket of yours...

00:21.445 --> 00:25.845
You wouldn't find any darks.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.885
What, do you think I'm holding
out on you?

00:27.965 --> 00:29.165
I don't know what to believe.

00:29.245 --> 00:32.005
Listen, I've plenty of coloreds.
You're welcome to my coloreds.

00:32.085 --> 00:34.285
I'm not interested
in your coloreds, Sarah.

00:34.365 --> 00:36.165
It's darks I need. Oh, listen, Da.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.405
Do not be starting at me
about darks, Mary.

00:38.485 --> 00:40.645
I've given you whatever darks I have.

00:40.725 --> 00:42.461
Stick on a half load
and be done with it, woman.

00:42.485 --> 00:45.565
A half load goes against everything
I stand for. You know that, Da.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.605
You away to do the big shop, Da?

00:47.685 --> 00:50.125
Aye. Gerry! Gerry!

00:50.205 --> 00:53.045
I don't see why that useless drip
you call a husband has to be coming.

00:53.125 --> 00:56.405
Because someone needs to drive
and you've been suspended, again.

00:56.485 --> 00:58.461
- What did you do this time, Daddy?
- Nothing!

00:58.485 --> 01:00.245
It's RUC discrimination.

01:00.325 --> 01:02.381
The only crime I committed
was to be born a Catholic.

01:02.405 --> 01:04.405
Gerry's never been suspended
and he's a Catholic.

01:04.485 --> 01:06.085
He's also a prick, but that's by the by.

01:06.165 --> 01:07.805
- Cut that out, Da.
- Found some.

01:07.885 --> 01:09.365
- Oh!
- Found some, Mary.

01:13.085 --> 01:15.445
- Great.
- Right. That's us away.

01:15.525 --> 01:16.525
Have a nice time.

01:16.605 --> 01:19.125
Tell that Free State fucker
to shift his hole.

01:21.205 --> 01:22.845
I'm sure we will.

01:23.525 --> 01:26.325
There's no shame in doing a half load,
you know, Mary.

01:26.725 --> 01:29.365
I can't, Sarah. I physically can't.

Hey! Let me look at that.

01:43.885 --> 01:45.205
You call that clean, do you?

01:45.285 --> 01:48.005
Different standards, you see, Mary.

01:48.085 --> 01:49.885
You're not in England now, son.

01:49.965 --> 01:51.365
Orla was the one who washed it.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.605
Oh, okay.

01:54.045 --> 01:56.965
Okay. I have had it with you, James,

01:57.045 --> 02:01.885
and your picking, picking, picking,
and I won't take it anymore.

02:01.965 --> 02:04.285
- Do you hear me?
- Is everything okay, Orla?

02:04.365 --> 02:05.805
I warned you, Orla.

02:05.885 --> 02:09.005
You're putting yourself
under too much pressure.

02:09.085 --> 02:10.205
Can't fail, Mammy.

02:10.285 --> 02:12.205
Since when have you
been troubled by exams?

02:12.285 --> 02:15.085
Exams? What are you on about, Erin?

02:15.165 --> 02:17.485
- What are you on about, Orla?
- Step.

02:17.565 --> 02:19.245
- I'm sorry?
- Step aerobics.

02:19.325 --> 02:21.485
Orla's got really into step aerobics.

02:21.565 --> 02:23.765
Her instructor says she's a natural.

02:23.845 --> 02:26.005
Says she's got what it takes
to go all the way.

02:26.085 --> 02:27.405
All the way in step aerobics?

02:27.485 --> 02:29.325
But it's out of control now, Mary.

02:29.405 --> 02:31.605
She's stepping morning, noon and night.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.085
Apart from anything else, it's dangerous.

02:34.165 --> 02:36.325
She nearly came
through the ceiling yesterday.

02:36.405 --> 02:39.165
Okay, she might be gifted,

02:39.245 --> 02:42.005
but I just want her
to have a normal childhood.

02:42.445 --> 02:44.725
I won't give it up. I can't.

02:44.805 --> 02:46.965

Jesus, Joe.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.045
What are you doing here?
Meeting your fancy woman, I suppose.

03:22.125 --> 03:24.805
No, I'm not. I'm collecting Mary's
photographs.

03:24.885 --> 03:28.125
And if I was having an illicit rendezvous
with my mistress,

03:28.205 --> 03:29.765
I'm not sure that the supermarket

03:29.845 --> 03:32.005
that my father-in-law
is doing the big shop in

03:32.085 --> 03:34.725
- would be the best place for it, really.
- "Quinn", you said?

03:34.805 --> 03:36.365
- That's right. Great.
- Here we go.

03:36.445 --> 03:39.845
That'll be £3.75, please.
And have you got your wee docket there?

03:39.925 --> 03:41.765
- Yeah, I do.
- It's a wee red slip of paper,

03:41.845 --> 03:43.285
- about yea big.
- Yeah.

03:43.365 --> 03:45.021
- Dark blue lettering, it has.
- Yeah, I know.

03:45.045 --> 03:46.581
Not a navy blue, more like a royal blue.

03:46.605 --> 03:47.805
I know what it looks like.

03:47.885 --> 03:50.085
Times New Roman,
I believe the font is called.

03:50.165 --> 03:52.845
- I just can't find it.
- Prick.

03:52.925 --> 03:56.965
Uh, look, I'm sorry.
Do you absolutely need it?

03:57.045 --> 03:59.685
I'm afraid I do, sir, yes. Proof of ID.

03:59.765 --> 04:01.645
But you have my surname
written on it there.

04:02.165 --> 04:03.461
How do I know that's your surname?

04:03.485 --> 04:05.045
Because I told you it was my surname.

04:05.125 --> 04:07.245
- You could be lying.
- Why would I lie?

04:07.325 --> 04:09.125
To get your hands
on someone else's photos.

04:09.725 --> 04:11.365
Why would I want somebody else's photos?

04:11.445 --> 04:13.061
Who would pay for somebody else's photos?

04:13.085 --> 04:16.404
- Stalker, maybe.
- Yeah, exactly. Very good, sir.

04:16.485 --> 04:18.565
- A stalker.
- I'm not a stalker.

04:18.644 --> 04:22.605
Look, why don't you just go home
and have a wee look for your wee docket?

04:22.685 --> 04:23.885
No. This is ridiculous.

04:23.965 --> 04:26.445
Just open that up
and take out one of the photos.

04:29.405 --> 04:31.965
You see? That's me wife there.

04:32.045 --> 04:33.701
How do I know you're not
just telling me that?

04:33.725 --> 04:35.645
'Cause that's me standing beside her.

04:37.925 --> 04:39.645
I suppose you do look a bit like
this man.

04:39.725 --> 04:41.245
I am this man.

04:42.405 --> 04:45.445
- It could be you.
- It's definitely me.

04:45.525 --> 04:48.765
My name is Gerry Quinn.
This is my father-in-law, Joe.

04:48.845 --> 04:49.965

05:38.085 --> 05:39.405
Get down. Get down.

05:42.045 --> 05:44.365
I've received a phone call from
Louise Kerr's mother,

05:44.445 --> 05:45.981
- and it's not looking great.
- Oh, God.

05:46.005 --> 05:47.525
I just can't believe it.

05:47.605 --> 05:50.221
It's unlikely she'll be returning
to school before the end of the year,

05:50.245 --> 05:51.981
so I think the only thing
we can do now is...

05:52.005 --> 05:54.085
- Pray for her?
- No. What use would that do?

05:54.165 --> 05:55.725
No, I think the best thing we can do

05:55.805 --> 05:58.285
is decide who will fulfill
the role of editor now.

05:59.365 --> 06:03.165
Sister Michael, some of us have actually
already discussed this eventuality,

06:03.725 --> 06:06.085
and the thing is, well,
nobody's comfortable

06:06.165 --> 06:07.365
stepping into Louise's shoes.

06:07.445 --> 06:10.045
It feels a bit, sort of, disrespectful.

06:10.125 --> 06:12.725
We think this issue should be canceled.

06:12.805 --> 06:15.445
Right, well, fair enough,
if nobody is willing to take her place...

06:15.525 --> 06:17.165
- I'll do it.
- Excuse me?

06:18.325 --> 06:21.285
I'll take her place.
I'll step into her shoes.

06:21.365 --> 06:22.885
- I'll do it.
- Really?

06:23.445 --> 06:25.885
- Absolutely.
- No, you can't.

06:25.965 --> 06:28.805
We are making a statement.
You're ruining our statement.

06:28.885 --> 06:32.085
Look, girls,
I know Louise meant a lot to you all.

06:32.165 --> 06:34.845
- She's not dead, Erin.
- Well, not yet.

06:35.685 --> 06:38.285
Hopefully, she won't, you know, die,

06:38.365 --> 06:41.725
but if she does, the show must go on.

06:41.805 --> 06:43.485
Isn't that right, Sister Michael?

06:44.125 --> 06:45.125
You terrify me.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.645
You can't be the editor.

06:46.725 --> 06:48.445
You've never written an article, Erin.

06:48.525 --> 06:51.365
That's because I can't get anything
past Rupert Murdoch over there.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.485
This isn't fair.
You can't let it happen, Sister.

06:54.565 --> 06:58.125
I know, but I'm bored now,
so it looks like I probably will.

06:58.205 --> 06:59.405

you have to hang on to the wee docket.

07:07.685 --> 07:09.925
Look, I've said that I'm sorry.

07:10.005 --> 07:13.125
They were my birthday photos,
for God's sake.

07:13.205 --> 07:15.341
There's definitely grounds
for an annulment here, Mary.

07:15.365 --> 07:16.925

07:17.005 --> 07:19.125

given the circumstances?

07:21.325 --> 07:23.405

07:23.485 --> 07:25.005
- No, Da.
- Please, love.

07:25.085 --> 07:27.205
- Just the once.
- I'm not letting you hit him, Da.

07:27.285 --> 07:29.965
I'm devastated. That was when I lost
the half-stone

07:30.045 --> 07:31.805
doing the Rosemary Conley, as well.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.325

07:35.725 --> 07:37.725
Aye, you were far too thin, Sarah.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.405
No, it was. It was brilliant,

07:39.485 --> 07:42.605

as a photograph to look back on.

10:00.525 --> 10:03.365
I can't let my heart rate drop,
I'm afraid, Erin.

10:03.445 --> 10:06.045
Let's just run through
some of our favorite ideas.

10:06.125 --> 10:08.365
So, firstly, animals.

10:08.445 --> 10:11.365
- Animals. Can someone elaborate?
- Yeah.

10:11.445 --> 10:15.565
So, this concept would focus on animals,

10:15.645 --> 10:19.525
alongside pictures of famous people
who look a bit like animals.

10:19.605 --> 10:21.885
- Michelle Pfeiffer looks like a cat.
- Exactly.

10:21.965 --> 10:24.565
Okay. Right. Animals.

10:24.645 --> 10:26.565
Uh, what's the next one? Shoes of the...

10:26.645 --> 10:28.725
- Shoes of the world.
- And that involves...?

10:28.805 --> 10:33.565
So, this piece would concentrate
on different shoes from around the world,

10:33.645 --> 10:39.165
sitting alongside pictures of, you know,
different shoes from around the world.

10:39.885 --> 10:40.885
Okay.

10:40.925 --> 10:42.925
So, like, how in Russia
they wear boots because...

10:43.005 --> 10:45.605
- It's Baltic.
- And in India they wear sandals because...

10:45.685 --> 10:47.045
It's boiling.

10:47.965 --> 10:49.565
So that's it, is it?

10:50.685 --> 10:52.005
Thoughts?

10:52.085 --> 10:55.405
I'm not totally convinced
by either of them, if I'm honest.

11:00.045 --> 11:01.845
Oh, my God. They're shit.

11:03.645 --> 11:05.645
They're absolutely shit.

11:07.365 --> 11:10.205
How can we print this utter shit?

11:10.285 --> 11:12.685
- Okay, don't panic.
- Don't panic?

11:12.765 --> 11:14.445
Don't panic, James?

11:14.525 --> 11:17.365
"Shoes of the world".
What does that even mean?

11:17.445 --> 11:19.685
- Yeah, we're fucked.
- No. It's okay.

11:19.765 --> 11:21.245
It's gonna be okay.

11:21.325 --> 11:25.125
We-we-we just need to change
our approach slightly.

11:25.205 --> 11:26.805
The writing competition?

11:26.885 --> 11:29.685
Exactly. There's bound to be
something in here we can steal.

11:29.765 --> 11:31.605
We can just steal something,

11:31.685 --> 11:33.605
and we'll-we'll just steal someone's idea

11:33.685 --> 11:35.085
and we'll pass it off as our own.

11:35.165 --> 11:37.725
Journalistic integrity at its finest.

11:37.805 --> 11:39.565
"Searching for Myself"?
What a load of balls.

11:40.845 --> 11:42.925
- Oh, my God.
- Let's see.

11:43.525 --> 11:46.285
"Suffocation: The Secret Life
of a Gay Teenager".

11:47.845 --> 11:49.285
It's anonymous.

11:51.165 --> 11:52.805
- It wasn't me.
- No.

11:52.885 --> 11:56.805
This was written by a girl.
A real-life lesbian walks among us.

11:56.885 --> 11:58.765
I don't really believe in lesbians.

11:58.845 --> 12:00.805
This is perfect. We'll just print this.

12:00.885 --> 12:03.325
- Come on, Erin, you can't do that.
- Why not?

12:03.405 --> 12:05.565
We'll get in trouble,
real trouble, big trouble.

12:05.645 --> 12:07.365
You're not afraid of a bit of
controversy?

12:07.445 --> 12:09.845
Yes. Actually, yes, I am.

12:09.925 --> 12:12.365
Something like this could go
on our permanent record, Erin.

12:12.445 --> 12:14.125
And what's more important, Clare?

12:14.205 --> 12:18.885
Your permanent record
or... telling this poor girl's story?

12:18.965 --> 12:21.165
My permanent record.

12:21.245 --> 12:23.565
- Count me out.
- Fine.

12:23.645 --> 12:25.965
Well, this issue of <i> The Habit</i>
will go down in history!

12:26.045 --> 12:27.725
In history, I say!

12:28.365 --> 12:30.285
You seriously need to chill the fuck out.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.565
Not happening.

12:37.205 --> 12:39.845
- But, Sister Michael...
- Don't even think about arguing.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.685
I can't be doing
with the board of governors

12:41.765 --> 12:43.661
getting wind of something like this
at the moment.

12:43.685 --> 12:45.525
They're a thorn in my ass
at the best of times.

12:45.565 --> 12:48.645
I mean, for God's sake, Erin,
what happened to "Shoes of the World"?

12:48.725 --> 12:50.165
This is more important.

12:50.245 --> 12:52.965
This is about, you know, gay rights.

12:53.045 --> 12:56.645
I see. And I take it that's what
the camp shirts are in aid of.

12:56.725 --> 12:58.765
A very serious uniform violation,
by the way.

12:58.845 --> 13:00.925
But let's take one problem at a time,
shall we?

13:01.005 --> 13:02.845
This isn't a problem, Sister.

13:02.925 --> 13:05.445
This is groundbreaking journalism.

13:06.085 --> 13:09.245
They are not to be distributed tomorrow.
Do I make myself clear?

13:09.325 --> 13:10.885
But that's censorship.

13:11.645 --> 13:13.405
Well done. You are correct.

13:13.485 --> 13:15.245
You're being censored, now go.

13:23.005 --> 13:25.805
You see, I was so focused on
pissing off that gobshite

13:25.885 --> 13:28.685
my eldest girl's unfortunate enough
to be married to,

13:28.765 --> 13:30.965
that I completely lost sight of the fact

13:31.045 --> 13:33.445
that they were really her birthday photos.

13:33.525 --> 13:35.405
And my other girl, my younger girl,

13:35.485 --> 13:39.445
well, she was looking very slim
at the time, so go and grab them for me,

13:39.525 --> 13:41.125
there's a good fella.

13:41.205 --> 13:42.645
I can't accept that.

13:43.285 --> 13:46.165
I think something's been lost
in translation here, boy.

13:47.485 --> 13:49.445
Here, Daddy. Get a whiff of that.

13:50.565 --> 13:52.765
- Oh, that's very nice, love.
- It's you.

13:54.685 --> 13:56.765
- What?
- The photographs.

13:56.845 --> 13:58.365
Well, I remember you.

13:58.445 --> 13:59.765
I couldn't forget you.

14:00.765 --> 14:02.765
Hope you don't mind me saying this,

14:02.845 --> 14:05.285
but you have a cracking clavicle.

14:07.565 --> 14:09.005
I don't mind, Ciaran.

14:09.565 --> 14:12.645
I don't mind at all.

14:14.365 --> 14:16.045
Oh, for Christ's sake.

14:16.765 --> 14:21.085
It's wrong.
I mean, my God, the injustice of it all.

14:21.165 --> 14:24.285
You should get that one framed
as a wee reminder of your night, Mary.

14:24.365 --> 14:25.525
I'm not in that one.

14:25.605 --> 14:27.845
No, but it's stunning of me.

14:27.925 --> 14:30.085
- It is indeed.
- Hey, boy.

14:30.165 --> 14:32.445
It's dinner she invited you round for,
not an orgy.

14:32.525 --> 14:36.565
She basically told us we can't print
the story because it's about a lesbian.

14:36.645 --> 14:39.725
Do you not think there's an awful lot
of lesbians about nowadays?

14:39.805 --> 14:41.725
You can't move for lesbians.

14:41.805 --> 14:44.005
It's wall-to-wall lesbians out there.

14:44.085 --> 14:45.525
- Really?
- It's true.

14:45.605 --> 14:47.405
Brigitte Gallagher, she's a lesbian.

14:47.485 --> 14:49.405
Brigitte Gallagher,
who works in the post office?

14:49.445 --> 14:52.285
- I believe so.
- Is she not a vegetarian, Da?

14:52.925 --> 14:55.125
Sorry, you're right.
Vegetarian, Brigitte is.

14:55.925 --> 14:58.485
Well, it's an easy mistake to make, Joe.

14:59.085 --> 15:00.285
Can I call you Joe?

15:00.365 --> 15:02.805
- No.
- Right.

15:03.765 --> 15:04.925
Welcome to the club, Ciaran.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.645
I'm gonna have to make a stand
about this, Mammy.

15:07.725 --> 15:09.165
Ah, no, you won't, Erin.

15:09.245 --> 15:14.965
The school is trying to erase this young
girl's experience, all because she's gay.

15:15.045 --> 15:17.525
I mean, what if it were me?

15:17.605 --> 15:19.045
What if it were Orla?

15:19.125 --> 15:20.965
Fine, stick up for the wee lesbian.

15:21.845 --> 15:26.085
I just don't understand what they eat.

15:28.765 --> 15:30.125
Read all about the wee dyke.

15:30.205 --> 15:31.805
We will not be censored!

15:31.885 --> 15:33.845
Lesbians really do exist!

15:33.925 --> 15:38.365
I support gays, even though I, myself,
am not actually gay!

15:38.445 --> 15:40.525
- Come on, Clare.
- I don't wanna get involved.

15:40.605 --> 15:42.965

15:55.365 --> 15:57.445
They're ignoring the ban, Sister.

15:57.525 --> 15:59.605
You need to put a stop to it.

16:03.685 --> 16:05.325
Sister, didn't you hear me?

16:05.405 --> 16:08.285
Do you know what, Jenny?
I don't think I did.

16:11.885 --> 16:14.565

- It's all anyone's talking about.

16:14.645 --> 16:17.085
Everyone's buzzing to find out
who she is.

16:17.165 --> 16:20.765
Well, if she ever does reveal herself,
she'll basically be a celebrity.

16:22.925 --> 16:24.965
Excuse me. Excuse me, everybody!

16:25.045 --> 16:28.805
Excuse me. Excuse me.

16:29.565 --> 16:32.325
I just wanna say,
that if you're looking for the wee lezzer,

16:32.405 --> 16:35.285
look no further, because here she is.

16:36.285 --> 16:39.365
Love women.
Can't get enough of the ladies.

16:39.445 --> 16:41.645

Aye, good one.

16:45.085 --> 16:48.005
- You're talking shite.
- Fuck off.

16:52.405 --> 16:56.405
- Hi.
- It's crawled out from under its rock?

16:56.485 --> 16:59.805
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I know. I'm sorry.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.285
It all just made me a bit nervous.

17:01.365 --> 17:04.325
Everything makes you nervous, Clare.
You're a walking cack attack.

17:04.405 --> 17:06.244
I can't help that.
It's the way God made me.

17:06.325 --> 17:10.204
Michelle's running round saying it's her,
that she wrote the story,

17:10.285 --> 17:11.605
that she's the wee lesbian.

17:11.685 --> 17:13.005
As if, like.

17:13.085 --> 17:15.165
- There'd be more chance of it being you.
- It is me.

17:15.204 --> 17:17.165
No, I mean, I'd be less surprised
if it was you.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.045
- It is.
- No, it's not, but if it was...

17:19.125 --> 17:21.565
Erin, it's me.

17:21.645 --> 17:24.125
I'm the wee... lesbian.

17:24.204 --> 17:26.724
- So you are, Clare.
- I'm not joking.

17:29.045 --> 17:31.725
You're... you're a lesbian?

17:31.805 --> 17:34.165
I've never been brave enough
to say it out loud before,

17:34.245 --> 17:37.725
but I think that's why I wrote the story,
and then it all got too real.

17:37.805 --> 17:41.005
I got too scared, but now, well...

17:41.085 --> 17:43.325
you made me realize it's all okay.

17:43.885 --> 17:44.925
Don't blame me.

17:45.525 --> 17:46.365
What?

17:46.445 --> 17:47.765
You fancy girls?

17:47.845 --> 17:50.245
Well, that's sort of an entry level
requirement, Erin.

17:50.325 --> 17:51.885
- I think I'm gonna boke.
- Do you mind?

17:51.925 --> 17:54.125
- I'm trying to come out to you.
- Well, don't.

17:54.205 --> 17:55.405
Don't come out. Go back in.

17:55.485 --> 17:57.125
I don't wanna go back in.

17:57.205 --> 18:01.605
Well, I'm sorry, Clare, but I'm just
not interested in you, not like that.

18:01.685 --> 18:04.205
"Not interested in you like that."
Look at the state of you.

18:04.285 --> 18:05.965
Oh, come off it.

18:06.045 --> 18:09.325
Your arrogance is staggering, Erin.

18:09.405 --> 18:11.525
Well, you know what else is staggering?
Your gayness.
