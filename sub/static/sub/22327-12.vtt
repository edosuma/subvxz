WEBVTT

00:12.512 --> 00:13.805
Seven months ago...

00:15.015 --> 00:17.726
my consciousness was sent
from the distant future

00:17.809 --> 00:20.145
into the body
of Special Agent Grant MacLaren

00:20.228 --> 00:24.023
moments before he would historically
have died in the line of duty.

00:25.316 --> 00:28.361
Since then, I have assumed
his life, his work...

00:29.446 --> 00:30.488
his marriage...

00:32.032 --> 00:34.617
pretending to be a man
very different than myself.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.581
In truth, I am traveler 3468,

00:39.664 --> 00:41.875
one of thousands
of travelers around the world

00:41.958 --> 00:44.878
who have come from a time
when life is all but wiped out...

00:46.254 --> 00:47.672
to save humanity.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.091
To change the path.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.219
I know how that must sound.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.097
Especially to you, Kat.

00:58.683 --> 00:59.684
But it's true.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.550
[cell phone vibrates]

02:37.574 --> 02:39.450
Good afternoon, Agent MacLaren.

02:39.534 --> 02:40.535
Where is she?

02:40.618 --> 02:42.287
Perrow? She's safe...

02:42.787 --> 02:45.373
though her neck might be
a little tender

02:45.456 --> 02:47.876
after having to remove the comm
she allowed you to plant.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.168
Let her go, Ingram.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.880
Of course.
Soon as we put this to an end.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.756
I'd like to propose a truce.

02:54.757 --> 02:57.427
You kidnapped and tortured my team,

02:57.510 --> 02:59.053
killed travelers all over the world.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.347
I needed to know if the Director
was still after me,

03:01.431 --> 03:03.099
and that suspicion was confirmed.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.853
My mission was to die immediately
after my arrival.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.939
By surviving, I committed a crime
against the grand plan

03:10.023 --> 03:11.649
and was condemned to death.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.901
Is that fair?

03:12.984 --> 03:14.527
-Not up to me.
-No.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.196
No, it's up to the Director...

03:17.780 --> 03:19.741
who has no understanding,

03:19.824 --> 03:21.159
no forgiveness,

03:21.784 --> 03:22.619
no soul,

03:22.702 --> 03:25.580
because it is a machine.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.081
I'm tired of running.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.791
Take a selfie.
You can end it right now.

03:28.875 --> 03:32.128
For me, the digital age
has created a prison around me,

03:32.211 --> 03:33.421
one that's been...

03:34.631 --> 03:36.257
shrinking over time.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.967
That's no way for my son to grow up.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.886
Are you trying to get sympathy from me?

03:39.969 --> 03:41.221
No. No.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.848
No, I want your word
that you'll leave me alone

03:43.932 --> 03:47.060
while I prepare my affairs
and face my accuser.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.144
That's not gonna go well for you.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.270
I have no illusions.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.397
I know exactly what's going to happen.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.400
I stole 16 years that I wouldn't
otherwise have had,

03:54.484 --> 03:57.904
and in that time,
I created a precious life.

03:59.155 --> 04:02.492
My son shouldn't have to pay
for the mistakes of his father.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.623
Do I have your word?

04:09.207 --> 04:11.459
You don't have my anything.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.295
That's not actually true.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.092
Grant, please help me.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.052
Son of a-- [grunts]

04:24.681 --> 04:26.182
If you fucking hurt her--

04:26.266 --> 04:27.976
3468,

04:28.059 --> 04:30.186
if you want to see your wife again,

04:30.270 --> 04:32.355
follow this simple instruction:

04:32.438 --> 04:33.648
stay out of my way.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.465
He showed me a video.
She's being held somewhere.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.550
[Marcy]  Is she hurt?

05:00.633 --> 05:01.509
No, I couldn't tell.

05:01.592 --> 05:04.971
Boss, he's faked things like this before.
Are you sure it was Kathryn?

05:05.054 --> 05:06.806
Yes.
Her phone goes straight to voice mail.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.057
-What does he want?
- A truce.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.392
Fuck that.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.894
Said he's gonna show himself
to the Director and face punishment,

05:11.978 --> 05:13.396
but he wants us all to stand down

05:13.479 --> 05:15.106
so he can make arrangements
for his son.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.899
Kat's his insurance.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.485
He's spent all this time hiding
and torturing travelers,

05:19.569 --> 05:20.778
only to turn himself in.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.113
I don't buy it, either.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.032
Right now, I just want Kat to be safe.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.616
Philip, can you trace her phone's GPS?

05:25.700 --> 05:26.534
I can try.

05:26.617 --> 05:29.454
I don't think he can monitor our comms,
but let's be careful.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.414
If he finds out we're looking for her...

05:31.497 --> 05:32.498
What about Perrow?

05:32.582 --> 05:35.126
He claims she's still alive, but you
should all check on your loved ones

05:35.209 --> 05:36.377
and make sure they're okay.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.087
I'm going to Kat's place.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.097
David's not answering.

05:48.681 --> 05:49.891
Neither is Jeff.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.810
Gary. Hey. I'm just checking in.
How is everything?

05:53.644 --> 05:55.146
Okay, let's go.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.689
[Trevor] Mom's good, too?

05:56.773 --> 06:00.526
No, I won't be home for dinner.
I gotta run, but you guys have a good day.

06:25.551 --> 06:26.552
[gasps]

06:29.222 --> 06:30.056
Please!

06:33.601 --> 06:35.895
I'm sorry for having treated you this way,

06:35.978 --> 06:39.148
but we needed to remove
the device as quickly as possible.

06:39.649 --> 06:40.900
Where's my daughter?

06:40.983 --> 06:41.818
Home.

06:43.402 --> 06:44.403
I don't believe you.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.616
Someone's supervising her as we speak.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.284
-[rings]
- [Ava]  Hello.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.410
Ava!

06:52.411 --> 06:53.830
Sweetie, are you hurt?

06:53.913 --> 06:56.749
No. There's a man here.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.751
Are you coming home?

06:58.835 --> 07:00.962
Soon. Very soon.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.131
Where are you? You said you were--

07:03.631 --> 07:06.134
[Vincent] I promise you,
Ava is going to see her mother shortly.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.268
There's just one more thing
I need you to do.

07:28.114 --> 07:28.948
David?

07:47.425 --> 07:48.259
[comm beeps]

07:48.342 --> 07:49.886
Guys, David's gone.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.804
[Carly through comm]
So are Jeff and the baby.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.640
Marcy, the place is destroyed.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.518
What do we do?

08:25.671 --> 08:27.840
[sighs]

08:35.139 --> 08:36.516
[remote control clicks]

09:07.046 --> 09:08.839
Never thought my day would start this way.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.134
You really want to mount an interagency
investigation into Vincent Ingram?

09:12.218 --> 09:13.469
We're wasting time.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.637
Mack, think this through.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.846
He has them captive.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.682
And he warned you things could get worse.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.601
The man said he was gonna give himself up
to the Director.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.186
-Let's wait this out.
-You believe him?

09:22.270 --> 09:24.897
-Why would he go through the trouble--
-He's psychotic!

09:24.981 --> 09:28.276
He's spent years hunting traveler teams,
mine included.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.570
They'd be dead if I hadn't used
NSA resources--

09:30.653 --> 09:32.905
Which is one of the reasons
why they're onto us.

09:33.489 --> 09:34.699
What are you talking about?

09:34.782 --> 09:36.033
A few weeks ago,

09:36.117 --> 09:37.285
I saw a report.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.037
DoD, Homeland Security,

09:40.121 --> 09:41.747
CIA, the NSA--

09:41.831 --> 09:44.041
It wasn't just my host's
task force that was suspicious--

09:44.125 --> 09:47.003
we've been discovered across
all the intelligence services,

09:47.086 --> 09:49.297
probably worldwide.

09:49.880 --> 09:50.715
Jesus.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.925
They think we're
some new terrorist organization.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.511
Cells in over a hundred countries.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.888
They haven't acted
because they're scared as shit.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.684
Our people at the NSA
and Homeland Security

10:01.767 --> 10:03.603
are concealing us
as best they can,

10:03.686 --> 10:06.355
but at this point, it's only a matter
of time before there are leaks.

10:06.981 --> 10:10.568
Going after Ingram would raise
a red flag we can't afford.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.696
[Philip]  Boss, I managed to unlock
multiple locations from their phones.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.574
The last one recorded
was 3:28 p.m. yesterday,

10:16.657 --> 10:18.242
all from the same place.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.786
Send me the address.
Keep your eye on the back channels.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.872
-The rest of you meet me there.
-[Wakefield] Mac!

10:27.043 --> 10:28.169
Hello, Kathryn.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.199
[door closes]

11:00.743 --> 11:02.787
My name is Katrina Perrow.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.080
I'm a psychologist.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.498
Where am I?

11:05.581 --> 11:07.792
I'm not permitted to tell you that.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.595
Why are we here?

11:23.682 --> 11:26.477
There are questions
I'm supposed to ask you.

11:27.812 --> 11:31.273
But I want you to know that I am
also doing this against my will.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.071
They've taken my daughter Ava.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.700
Now, if we just work together

11:41.784 --> 11:43.828
and do what they want,

11:43.911 --> 11:45.079
they'll let us all go.

11:46.914 --> 11:47.873
Can we do that?

11:51.544 --> 11:52.378
[sniffs]

11:59.552 --> 12:02.096
When did you first notice changes
in your husband?

12:07.184 --> 12:09.437
It has all been for the greater good.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.773
The lives lost when Van Huizen exploded

12:12.857 --> 12:15.067
ensured the survival of millions

12:15.151 --> 12:17.403
who would have died
just over a year from now.

12:18.154 --> 12:21.282
Millions of people who have
no idea how close they came to the end,

12:21.365 --> 12:23.909
and they were saved by travelers.

12:25.161 --> 12:25.995
That's what we do.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.415
Carly Shannon historically died

12:29.498 --> 12:32.752
at the hand of her drunk,
abusive boyfriend.

12:34.044 --> 12:37.214
And now, instead of her child being raised
by a deadbeat father,

12:37.298 --> 12:39.008
he's surrounded by love.

12:41.010 --> 12:41.844
My love.

12:43.762 --> 12:47.766
Jeffrey Conniker Jr. will grow up
to be a good man,

12:47.850 --> 12:52.104
and millions of people around the world
won't suffer from the Helios catastrophe,

12:52.188 --> 12:54.440
so do you know what I have to say
about coming here...

12:55.441 --> 12:58.235
and taking this body and doing our work?

12:59.987 --> 13:01.322
You're welcome.

13:20.674 --> 13:21.509
Shit.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.514
That's Grace's phone.

13:26.597 --> 13:29.266
[static hissing]

13:40.945 --> 13:42.279
[steady beeping]

13:45.824 --> 13:47.326
[Vincent] Simon.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.787
You said it wouldn't take long.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.331
Yeah, but that's before
the interface overheated.

13:52.414 --> 13:55.042
And, yeah, I knew you were there.
You didn't sneak up on me.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.671
There isn't much time.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.632
I know. I have a clock in my head.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.470
I need more coolant.
Did you bring it?

14:07.471 --> 14:09.306
Everything you need is in this room.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.518
Remember, we're doing this for you.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.688
You said multiple uses,
multiple transfers.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.189
Yes.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.650
And then we'll take care of you.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.534
[Perrow] David.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.536
David.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.833
Sorry, I'm just--

14:37.668 --> 14:39.336
I've never been kidnapped before.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.215
I've been held hostage,
but that's a whole--

14:43.299 --> 14:46.385
Please, just answer the question.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.095
Uh, yeah.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.514
I am.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.558
Was. Her social worker.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.059
How do you know about Marcy?

14:56.103 --> 14:57.271
Where is she?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.106
She's safe.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.360
As in safely captured

15:03.444 --> 15:04.904
or safe at home?

15:05.529 --> 15:06.906
They didn't take her.

15:06.989 --> 15:07.823
They?

15:07.907 --> 15:10.242
The same people who took my daughter.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.703
[stammers] That's terrible. I'm--

15:14.747 --> 15:16.123
Then they're after me?

15:17.416 --> 15:19.543
-What did I do?
-David, please.

15:19.627 --> 15:23.047
Just answer the questions
if you want us both to get out of here.

15:25.549 --> 15:26.383
Okay.

15:26.467 --> 15:29.511
Is it true that one day Marcy's
cognitive abilities changed

15:29.595 --> 15:32.848
and for all intents and purposes,
she was an entirely different person?

15:34.683 --> 15:35.559
Yeah.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.062
Didn't that seem odd to you?

15:38.562 --> 15:41.565
Of course it did. I thought a miracle
had happened. Are you kidding me?

15:42.566 --> 15:44.401
How did you justify that change?

15:45.694 --> 15:47.529
[stammers] The--

15:48.572 --> 15:50.532
I'm pretty sure I shouldn't be
talking about this.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.786
You have doctor-client privilege with me.

15:53.869 --> 15:54.745
You're not my doctor.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.372
-David.
-She's a doctor.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.456
Marcy Warton?

15:57.539 --> 16:00.918
With the FBI. Undercover.
She goes on secret missions.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.295
I've said too much.

16:03.879 --> 16:04.713
And you believed her?

16:05.130 --> 16:07.007
I met her boss-- Grant MacLaren.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.717
He's real. I've been to his office.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.345
He's gonna kill me.
I cracked in, like, five seconds.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.304
David.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.432
Marcy Warton is not an FBI agent.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.601
She's a traveler.

16:18.602 --> 16:19.812
From the future.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.272
A who?

16:22.856 --> 16:23.899
A time traveler.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.655
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.740
She was supposed to be killed
by a group of men

16:31.824 --> 16:33.826
outside the library where she worked.

16:33.909 --> 16:38.330
Seconds before her death,
a consciousness was sent from the future,

16:38.414 --> 16:39.957
supplanting Marcy's own.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.293
And that new traveler survived the attack.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.714
And, just a few months ago,

16:46.797 --> 16:49.383
that consciousness
was replaced yet again.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.885
She called it memory loss,

16:52.428 --> 16:56.015
but in fact, she was overwritten.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.269
Lady...

17:01.395 --> 17:03.689
what the fuck have you been smoking?

17:05.524 --> 17:07.401
[laughs]

17:17.995 --> 17:20.205
[footsteps approaching]

17:29.256 --> 17:30.090
Hi.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.344
Sort of glad I'm not alone here.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.309
I'm David.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.687
Kathryn.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.355
Kathryn.

17:47.733 --> 17:48.567
Are they all right?

17:49.902 --> 17:52.196
Still on whatever drug they gave me.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.283
You don't know any of them, do you?

17:57.743 --> 17:59.203
Uh, okay, wow.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.496
-Yes.
-You do?

18:00.579 --> 18:01.413
Ray?

18:03.248 --> 18:04.374
Ray, wake up!

18:05.793 --> 18:07.669
He got me out of a legal jam recently.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.506
It's weird. Ray?

18:11.507 --> 18:12.508
Ray, wake up!

18:12.591 --> 18:13.967
I already tried yelling.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.723
Oh, for God's sakes.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.517
-What?
-I know him, too.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.602
He's a cop.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.312
He interviewed me once about Marcy.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.396
Who's Marcy?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.318
Apparently a time traveler
from the future.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.071
She said my husband was, too.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.198
-Dr. Perrow?
-Yeah.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.533
You don't actually believe it.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.535
-Of course not!
-Of course not.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.037
[Jeffrey] Oh, shit.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.289
[David] It's all right,
you're not alone.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.251
Where's my son? Where's Jeffrey?
He's just a baby.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.378
He's not with us. I'm sorry.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.089
You're MacLaren's wife.

18:52.756 --> 18:53.757
Agent MacLaren?

18:53.841 --> 18:54.842
You know who I am?

18:54.925 --> 18:56.468
Yeah, I came to your house and told you

18:56.552 --> 18:58.554
your husband was screwing around
with my girl Carly.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.681
-Carly?
-What?

19:00.764 --> 19:01.640
You don't remember?

19:02.349 --> 19:04.017
No, that's something I would remember.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.602
So, then why would he bring us here?

19:05.686 --> 19:07.688
What? Why would Grant do this?

19:07.771 --> 19:10.232
She's right.
I don't think this is an FBI thing.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.110
How do you know my husband
works with the FBI?

19:13.193 --> 19:14.403
He's Marcy's boss, isn't he?

19:14.486 --> 19:16.113
David Mailer.

19:16.530 --> 19:17.823
You're the social worker creep that was

19:17.906 --> 19:19.950
screwing around
with the retarded girl Marcy.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.034
That's a hateful word.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.870
Okay, wait, who the fuck is Marcy?

19:22.953 --> 19:23.787
His client.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.706
One minute she's mentally disabled,

19:25.789 --> 19:28.083
the next minute she's whupping
a half dozen boys outside the library.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.501
Yeah, she was undercover.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.296
All right. Enough of this shit.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.423
We talk, or we get out of here.

19:37.092 --> 19:37.926
[pounding on door]

19:38.010 --> 19:43.098
Hey! Whoever the hell you think you are,
you just kidnapped a Metro police officer!

19:43.182 --> 19:44.641
That's a class "A" felony,

19:44.725 --> 19:46.977
and I'm gonna put your ass away.
You hear me?

19:49.688 --> 19:53.525
[groans] You have to be so loud?

19:59.406 --> 20:00.866
Who the hell are you?

20:01.450 --> 20:03.493
Hello, I'm David.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.537
I'm a friend of Marcy's.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.289
This is Kathryn.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.874
She's married to Agent MacLaren,

20:08.957 --> 20:09.958
who's Marcy's boss.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.335
This is Ray.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.045
He's still unconscious.

20:13.128 --> 20:17.549
The unhappy man is Officer Conniker,

20:17.633 --> 20:19.259
who I'm guessing is
in a relationship with Carly,

20:19.343 --> 20:20.552
who's also a friend of Marcy,

20:20.636 --> 20:23.055
all of whom may
or may not be time travelers.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.348
And you are?

20:25.390 --> 20:28.560
I'm a high school guidance counselor.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.520
Oh, okay. That makes perfect sense.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.860
[Kat] Wait, no. Don't you touch me.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.862
No, no. Do you touch me.

20:39.696 --> 20:40.948
Where are you taking me?

20:41.031 --> 20:42.282
Let me go!

20:42.491 --> 20:43.533
Let me go!

20:43.617 --> 20:45.035
The lady asked you to let her go!

20:45.118 --> 20:46.453
[grunts]

20:46.536 --> 20:47.829
[Kat panting] No!

20:49.289 --> 20:50.749
Let me go!

20:50.832 --> 20:51.833
[Grace sighs]

20:52.876 --> 20:54.294
Who's he again?

20:55.671 --> 20:56.880
He's my lawyer.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.524
Vince is sending us something.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.527
Boss!

21:18.610 --> 21:21.613
[Kat sobbing]

21:30.289 --> 21:34.334
Grant, in order for me
to be released unharmed...

21:34.918 --> 21:39.548
you must confess
to being a traveler on video.

21:42.843 --> 21:45.554
You have one hour to send it to this IP.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.015
Or they'll kill me.

21:58.734 --> 22:03.613
[gasps] Shit, not again.

22:08.160 --> 22:08.994
Ray?

22:09.995 --> 22:11.371
[chuckles]

22:11.455 --> 22:13.248
-David.
-Yeah.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.250
We've been kidnapped.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.253
I know that sounds crazy, but--

22:18.337 --> 22:20.339
How much do you owe Vargese?

22:22.758 --> 22:23.884
Vargese, anyone?

22:23.967 --> 22:25.510
We're not sure why we're here.

22:26.094 --> 22:28.138
Does this have anything to do
with the guy in your apartment

22:28.221 --> 22:30.348
who, uh... [clicks tongue]

22:30.432 --> 22:31.266
What?

22:31.349 --> 22:33.518
Oh... maybe.

22:35.103 --> 22:38.190
[chuckles]
Oh, what's with Mr. Big and Tall here?

22:38.690 --> 22:39.941
Hey, wait a minute.

22:40.525 --> 22:44.112
Come on, take it easy.
What the-- Aw, Jesus!

22:45.781 --> 22:46.782
Boss, I have to say this.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.576
If we do this, it goes against
everything we trained for.

22:49.659 --> 22:50.494
I know.

22:53.705 --> 22:54.748
I'm sorry.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.584
I'm not gonna let my wife die.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.086
I feel the same way about David.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.004
[Carly] Look, listen, listen.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.632
I want nothing more than
to hold my son right now.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.509
But the machine comes first.

23:05.592 --> 23:08.553
If you sit down at that computer
with the intention of confessing,

23:08.637 --> 23:09.638
you will be overwritten.

23:09.721 --> 23:12.099
I know how we can do this
and still maintain protocol one.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.604
I got my hands on an advanced
rootkit virus

23:17.687 --> 23:19.898
that I can plant in the code
of the video file.

23:19.981 --> 23:20.816
Is it traceable?

23:20.899 --> 23:23.735
Four months ago, it compromised
the Relicus Maxicloud in Austria

23:23.819 --> 23:25.737
for 47 minutes,
and they still don't know who did it.

23:25.821 --> 23:26.738
Do you?

23:26.822 --> 23:27.823
The Faction.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.201
I can track the video on the back channels
and find his location.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.578
-What if it spreads?
-I'll know where it goes.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.163
When the time comes,
we can shut it down.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.374
Yeah,
if the Director lets us get that far.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.210
Still not struck by lightning.

23:43.421 --> 23:44.256
Do it.

23:48.969 --> 23:49.803
Ready when you are.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.236
Seven months ago,

24:06.903 --> 24:09.531
my consciousness was sent
from the distant future

24:09.614 --> 24:12.284
into the body
of Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

24:17.664 --> 24:18.498
[beeps]

24:26.464 --> 24:27.299
[sighs]

24:29.676 --> 24:31.511
[device activates]

24:42.898 --> 24:46.234
Cooling systems
at minus 270 degrees.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.113
Superconductor efficiency, 99.8%.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.908
[electricity crackling]

24:56.036 --> 24:57.746
-Simon!
-It's overheating!

24:57.829 --> 24:59.664
Shut it down! Simon!

25:12.135 --> 25:13.553
It was supposed to work.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.138
Can you fix it?

25:15.222 --> 25:16.806
I told you, the device requires--

25:16.890 --> 25:19.517
Simon, can you fix it?

25:21.353 --> 25:22.729
This was all for you.

25:23.730 --> 25:24.940
All for you.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.360
I'm his only friend?

25:29.736 --> 25:31.404
Man, that is tragic.

25:32.405 --> 25:36.076
The guy travels through time,
becomes a junkie,

25:36.159 --> 25:40.038
and his only friend is a lawyer
with a gambling addiction who uses him?

25:40.121 --> 25:42.415
I'd like to, uh, keep us on track.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.806
How are things at home?

26:10.402 --> 26:11.444
Where's my son?

26:12.362 --> 26:14.364
Jeffrey's okay. For now.

26:14.447 --> 26:15.448
What does that mean?

26:15.532 --> 26:17.742
It means if you and I cooperate,

26:17.826 --> 26:19.786
then you'll see your son
and I'll see my daughter,

26:19.869 --> 26:22.205
but that entirely depends on you.

26:23.957 --> 26:26.209
There are some things
about Carly you need to know.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.797
In truth, I am traveler 3468.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.507
We've got it under control.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.801
Clearly you don't.
My teammate at the NSA

26:34.884 --> 26:37.637
flagged this during her routine scan
for traveler activity.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.432
-If any other agent had found this--
-Well, they didn't.

26:40.515 --> 26:42.934
And we've taken extra precautions
with Philip's virus.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.020
Once we get to Vincent,
we can corrupt the video.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.855
I just need time to flush him out.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.065
The intelligence agencies
already have a target on our backs.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.568
Well, then, let's work together
and get ahead of it.

26:53.653 --> 26:55.655
Those with my specialty
are chosen as infants

26:55.739 --> 26:57.365
in order to develop their minds

26:57.449 --> 26:59.576
to specifically serve
the traveler program.

27:01.619 --> 27:04.039
Some days, I felt like an experiment.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.292
Other days, like a superhuman.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.128
Today, I'm...

27:15.842 --> 27:18.470
The Director has kept watch
over my entire life...

27:19.846 --> 27:22.390
knowing the outcome of every decision,

27:22.474 --> 27:24.768
crafting my path forward.

27:26.644 --> 27:28.063
But here...

27:30.065 --> 27:33.818
I see people every day
who still believe in free will.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.948
They don't know any better.

27:43.536 --> 27:46.247
[grunting]

27:47.248 --> 27:49.376
I've taken down bigger guys than you.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.128
[Ray mutters]

27:52.462 --> 27:55.465
Do any of you think
this could actually be true?

27:55.548 --> 27:56.383
[Grace] What?

27:58.301 --> 27:59.844
A few months ago,

28:00.428 --> 28:02.430
I definitely noticed changes in Grant.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.642
It was truly like he was
a different person.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.727
What they're saying would explain--

28:07.811 --> 28:10.563
Oh, please.
Like time travel is actually possible?

28:10.647 --> 28:12.607
Okay, maybe you could send information

28:12.690 --> 28:15.360
in the form of some coherent energy
across space-time,

28:15.443 --> 28:17.070
but to calculate an exact position

28:17.153 --> 28:19.572
would require an almost impossible level
of accuracy,

28:19.656 --> 28:22.659
not to mention nearly a billion
zettaflops of processing power.

28:22.742 --> 28:25.912
And then to unpack it somehow,
without entropy

28:25.995 --> 28:28.957
[chuckles] in a biological...

28:32.001 --> 28:33.211
What do you do again?

28:33.294 --> 28:34.504
Guidance counselor.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.178
[phone vibrates]

28:42.846 --> 28:43.763
[elevator bell dings]

28:51.271 --> 28:54.941
He knows you tampered
with MacLaren's recording.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.405
Now each and every one
of you must record...

29:01.948 --> 29:03.324
your own confessions,

29:04.159 --> 29:05.994
or we will all be killed.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.666
Marcy, I just want to go home.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.212
I just want to go home.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.342
[Ray] All right, look, listen.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.846
We know there's only one way in,
one way out, right?

29:25.430 --> 29:27.932
Now, there's two of them, two of us.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.100
Let's take 'em.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.561
Oh, I can't wait to see this.

29:31.644 --> 29:32.979
[Jeff] Yeah. Yeah, okay.

29:33.062 --> 29:34.814
Next time, we jump 'em.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.024
You take the tall one.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.151
[footsteps approach]

29:38.234 --> 29:39.486
Which one is the tall one?

29:40.153 --> 29:43.114
-[grunts]
-Oh, my God, David.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.282
It's okay, I got you.

29:44.365 --> 29:45.992
I can't see out of my right eye.

29:46.075 --> 29:47.285
Is it okay?

29:47.368 --> 29:50.246
Uh... it's just swollen shut.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.164
Jeff.

29:51.247 --> 29:53.333
-Try that shit with me!
-Wait.

29:54.584 --> 29:55.877
Don't.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.256
I get it, I'm next. Let's go.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.725
My purpose is to save lives,

30:11.810 --> 30:14.646
whether that's a teammate in jeopardy

30:14.729 --> 30:17.774
or someone that's part of a mission
ordered by the Director.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.444
And I can't help but think that

30:21.528 --> 30:24.531
I've put one person's life
in more danger than they deserve.

30:26.658 --> 30:31.246
David, you've suffered because of me,
and there's just--

30:31.329 --> 30:33.331
there's no excuse for that.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.292
I cared enough to leave once.

30:36.376 --> 30:38.378
I should have just stayed away.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.637
I've lowered the temperature of the room.
I know, it's cold.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.180
It's bracing, yes.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.515
Is it ready?

30:50.598 --> 30:52.767
Almost. It's almost done.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.269
For two thousand years,

30:54.352 --> 30:57.438
mankind believed that God was created
in His image,

30:57.522 --> 31:00.441
guiding our lives, hearing our prayers.

31:00.525 --> 31:01.943
Could you hand me the screwdriver?

31:02.026 --> 31:03.903
But when those prayers weren't answered,

31:03.987 --> 31:07.073
they just chalked it up
to His divine will.

31:07.156 --> 31:10.410
But then mankind created the power
to build God,

31:11.160 --> 31:14.539
a machine more powerful than
any human mind could ever be.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.791
-It's on the workbench.
-The fate of our existence...

31:16.875 --> 31:18.293
just handed to an AI

31:18.376 --> 31:22.422
with the ability to monitor
each and every shifting time line,

31:22.505 --> 31:25.216
while we blindly obey its orders,

31:25.300 --> 31:27.969
with the belief that salvation will come.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.053
It's the Phillips head.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.764
The problem isn't the fact
that we believed in God.

31:31.848 --> 31:35.226
It's that we didn't believe
in ourselves. Fine. I'll get it.

31:36.477 --> 31:39.606
It's time to pull back the curtain
and take control of the present--

31:39.689 --> 31:41.608
to fight for our future.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.659
[device activates]

31:56.539 --> 31:57.373
It's working.

32:01.961 --> 32:03.087
Simon.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.924
We can finally fix you.

32:11.888 --> 32:15.767
[Grace] Psychologist. And you actually
enjoy talking to people for a living?

32:16.559 --> 32:18.186
When I'm not under duress.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.356
All right. Let's get it over with, then.

32:23.149 --> 32:25.234
-When are you from?
-When are  you  from?

32:27.195 --> 32:29.405
-What is your mission?
-What is  your  mission?

32:32.784 --> 32:34.786
-What is your specialty?
-What is your spec--

32:34.869 --> 32:36.287
All right, enough!

32:37.664 --> 32:41.960
You can stop pretending,
traveler 0027.

32:43.044 --> 32:43.878
Shit.

32:47.215 --> 32:48.633
Hey, have you seen this?

32:51.719 --> 32:55.223
-Uh... [chuckles]
-Is this supposed to be funny?

32:55.306 --> 32:57.392
I didn't do it. It's real.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.978
Jesus Christ.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.071
The videos have been disseminated
to servers

33:10.154 --> 33:11.906
in nearly every major city.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.741
Any luck over there?

33:13.825 --> 33:15.451
Locked out of everything.

33:16.035 --> 33:19.580
-You said you could control the virus.
-Yeah, well, he's pretty good, too.

33:19.664 --> 33:20.748
What are you saying?

33:20.832 --> 33:24.752
What I'm saying is that I can't corrupt
the video files already out there.

33:26.462 --> 33:28.673
The world is about to find out
who we are.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.591
Why isn't the Director stepping in?

33:30.675 --> 33:33.428
We must eventually find a way
to solve this.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.888
If not, it had its chance
to overwrite any one of us

33:35.972 --> 33:37.390
when we recorded our confessions.

33:37.473 --> 33:38.891
[computer beeps]

33:38.975 --> 33:40.184
He's sending us a message.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.271
UDIDs, MAC addresses.

33:44.397 --> 33:45.481
Possible coordinates.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.026
He's making us work for it.

33:48.776 --> 33:49.610
He's a dead man.

33:49.694 --> 33:53.740
He's a psychotic recluse.
You're asking if time travel is possible.

33:53.823 --> 33:55.158
You say that out loud again!

33:55.241 --> 33:56.242
And slowly.

33:59.662 --> 34:01.080
You've seen it, too.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.373
We couldn't get ahead of it.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.876
He sent it to all the major
news outlets, intelligence agencies--

34:04.959 --> 34:08.588
I have to believe that 21st century
skepticism is alive and well.

34:08.671 --> 34:10.590
Yeah, for  The New York Times,
sure, but...

34:10.673 --> 34:13.176
this isn't gonna be something
that goes away with the news cycle.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.678
The information he has fills in the pieces

34:15.762 --> 34:18.473
on dozens of traveler missions
the CIA could never explain.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.475
It's only a matter of time
before they put it together.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.643
No, the Director
will never let that happen.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.145
Yeah, well, here we are.

34:25.688 --> 34:26.856
What about your wife?

34:27.648 --> 34:29.484
[Philip]  Boss, I think I know
where they are.

34:29.567 --> 34:30.651
Sending you coordinates.

34:30.735 --> 34:31.944
[phone vibrates]

34:36.491 --> 34:37.909
This is the same...

34:39.285 --> 34:40.745
What the fuck?

35:14.737 --> 35:17.115
If you have any questions
about what you've just seen,

35:17.198 --> 35:19.242
feel free to ask Grace.

35:19.325 --> 35:20.409
She's one of them.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.217
[sighs]

36:04.537 --> 36:06.956
[cell phone vibrates]

36:07.039 --> 36:10.001
-[beeps]
-Ava, sweetie?

36:10.084 --> 36:12.503
Mom! The man said you're coming home.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.422
[sighs] I'll be home soon.

36:15.923 --> 36:16.966
I love you.

36:17.049 --> 36:18.092
I love you, too.

36:19.844 --> 36:20.678
[beeps]

36:33.524 --> 36:35.026
I wanted to say goodbye.

36:35.818 --> 36:38.112
-I'm scared.
-Don't be.

36:38.696 --> 36:40.114
You did it, Simon.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.074
The device works perfectly.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.330
Would you stay with me?

36:49.332 --> 36:50.750
If that's what you want.

36:53.419 --> 36:54.837
Thank you, Vincent.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.465
Thank you.

37:01.636 --> 37:02.845
Thank you, Vincent.

37:03.638 --> 37:07.642
[Trevor]  I was part of the original
test program for consciousness transfer...

37:09.644 --> 37:12.980
something we had to master
before we could even dream

37:13.064 --> 37:15.233
of traveling back through time.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.735
And I lived in many bodies,

37:17.818 --> 37:20.947
which makes me one of the oldest
living people in human history.

37:25.868 --> 37:28.704
I'll never forget what I saw
the first time I woke up.

37:30.873 --> 37:31.958
My former body...

37:33.459 --> 37:35.503
with glassy eyes, staring back at me.

37:37.630 --> 37:38.673
There was no one in there anymore.

37:39.674 --> 37:40.800
Just a husk.

37:40.883 --> 37:43.052
[fly buzzing]

37:43.135 --> 37:45.346
That image stays with me
everywhere I go.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.707
-[whirs]
-[gasps]

38:12.790 --> 38:14.792
[panting]

38:23.301 --> 38:27.305
Traveler 5692, arrival successful.

38:40.693 --> 38:45.239
All right, there's two of them,
two of us.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.657
It's now or never.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.745
Cancel the plan, cancel the plan.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.413
[Kat] What are you do-- Ow.

38:55.082 --> 38:56.000
Come on!

38:56.083 --> 38:57.960
[grunting]

38:58.044 --> 38:59.670
Where are you taking us?

38:59.754 --> 39:01.797
[woman on TV]
Though this news is still breaking,

39:01.881 --> 39:04.342
we can confirm that Vincent Ingram,

39:04.425 --> 39:07.053
owner of one of the world's
leading securities firms,

39:07.136 --> 39:09.138
is responsible for bringing to light

39:09.221 --> 39:11.849
what may be a new terrorist group,

39:11.932 --> 39:14.185
with cells positioned
throughout the world.

39:33.496 --> 39:36.332
Let me know when you have
confirmation the device has been moved.

39:37.666 --> 39:39.293
I need to speak with my son.

39:58.604 --> 39:59.814
Hello, Taylor.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.107
Remember me?

40:01.190 --> 40:02.274
Hi.

40:04.235 --> 40:07.071
Did your father explain to you that you're
gonna be living with me for a while?

40:07.655 --> 40:10.116
Yeah, but he didn't say why.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.161
So that we can be free.

40:21.502 --> 40:22.837
I'm Dr. Katrina Perrow,

40:23.295 --> 40:26.924
and Vincent Ingram has been my patient
for the last four months.

40:27.007 --> 40:28.634
For the purposes of this recording,

40:28.717 --> 40:31.637
he has asked me to break
doctor-patient confidentiality.

40:31.720 --> 40:34.348
This is not a subject
one can discuss openly

40:34.432 --> 40:38.644
because, frankly, it flies in the face
of 21st century science

40:38.727 --> 40:41.313
and what we currently perceive
to be possible.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.190
But everything you've heard is true--

40:44.275 --> 40:46.318
travelers do exist.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.529
What do you see?

40:49.613 --> 40:51.657
Nothing but God's country.

40:53.659 --> 40:56.412
Only reason to take us out
to the middle of nowhere is to kill us.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.290
Might as well say your prayers.

41:05.671 --> 41:07.298
People still pray in the future?

41:17.308 --> 41:20.311
[Perrow]  They operate covertly
in cells made up of five members...

41:20.394 --> 41:22.688
[Perrow and Vincent]
...each with a specialty.

41:22.771 --> 41:25.733
Their missions are sent
from an advanced AI that continuously

41:25.816 --> 41:28.277
keeps watch
over an ever-changing time line.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.238
They are spies...

41:31.322 --> 41:32.573
terrorists...

41:33.365 --> 41:35.451
and they will not stop
until their Director

41:35.534 --> 41:38.954
has achieved its primary goal,
the Grand Plan.

41:47.963 --> 41:50.591
[Vincent]
They are our wives, our husbands,

41:50.674 --> 41:52.676
our sons and our daughters.

41:54.094 --> 41:56.889
They know our secrets.
They know our future.

41:57.973 --> 41:59.517
They gain our trust,

41:59.600 --> 42:01.227
our affection.

42:01.310 --> 42:02.937
But it's all a lie.

42:04.104 --> 42:06.190
We must do whatever we can

42:06.273 --> 42:07.900
to stop them.

43:00.744 --> 43:02.997
Jesus, Kat, I was so afraid.

43:03.080 --> 43:03.998
Who are you?

43:05.541 --> 43:06.500
David.

43:08.043 --> 43:09.378
Don't touch me.

43:09.461 --> 43:11.880
-We can get through this.
-I don't think so.

43:13.799 --> 43:16.218
Ray, I am so sorry
that you had to go through that.

43:16.844 --> 43:19.847
I gotta hand it to you, kid, you were
straight with me from the start.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.057
But let's not pretend we're friends.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.393
-Please let me hold him.
-Stay the hell away from my son.

43:24.977 --> 43:25.978
You hear me?

43:28.230 --> 43:30.441
[Trevor] Grace... are you okay?

43:31.692 --> 43:33.360
-I don't know.
-[sirens wailing]

43:33.444 --> 43:35.154
[sighs]

43:41.201 --> 43:44.955
I'm telling you, this whole thing--
No, no, I can explain who did this.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.874
I don't want to hear anything from you.

43:48.250 --> 43:50.085
You killed my husband.
