So, how do you ladies like my car?

01:25.119 --> 01:26.419
Yeah, it's a pretty sweet ride.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.176
- It's fine.
- Ilana, you don't like my car?

01:29.211 --> 01:30.320
- I can tell.
- It's....

01:30.355 --> 01:33.059
- You sort of had this little...
- I'm a little squished back here.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.494
I think if I were in... In the front,

01:34.595 --> 01:37.497
maybe I would be less nauseous
and more physically comfortable.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.065
It's a time share.

01:39.166 --> 01:42.001
Me, Larry G., Duckbutter,
Bobby G., we all went in on it.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.304
I am rock hard that I'm gonna
see your childhood bedroom, Ab.

01:45.406 --> 01:50.643
It is so important for a relationship
to see a boyfriend's roots.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.267
- What?
- A friend's roots, I said.

01:52.302 --> 01:54.434
Yeah, you said boyfriend, but...

01:54.469 --> 01:58.217
Dad, I cannot believe that you're
turning my bedroom into an infrared sauna.

01:58.318 --> 02:01.550
You've been talking about this since
the day you dropped me off at college,

02:01.585 --> 02:03.956
- so I'm supportive.
- So GOOP.

02:04.058 --> 02:06.242
You should get a V-steam
for the next time we come in.

02:06.277 --> 02:07.907
- V-steam? - I don't
know what that is.

02:07.942 --> 02:09.312
Um, vagina.

02:09.347 --> 02:11.631
Love talking about vaginas with my dad.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.368
Don't worry about that noise.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.237
Ahh.

02:18.338 --> 02:20.440
So many beautiful memories here.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.175
Ilana, under that tree,

02:22.276 --> 02:24.844
that's where Abbi found a bee's nest

02:24.945 --> 02:26.992
and was stung over 300 times.

02:27.507 --> 02:28.752
- Made the paper.
- Yeah.

02:28.787 --> 02:30.456
- Congratulations.
- And that house?

02:30.491 --> 02:33.538
That's where she almost got taken
by the neighbors when they moved.

02:33.573 --> 02:34.253
What?

02:34.354 --> 02:36.943
I found her in their
Winnebago in a large cooler.

02:36.978 --> 02:37.854
Really?

02:37.889 --> 02:41.194
And over there is where Patty and I
told her we were getting a divorce.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.362
I never understood why
you did it by the trash.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.731
Well, you liked playing in
the trash so much as a kid,

02:45.732 --> 02:47.066
so we thought if we told you there,

02:47.167 --> 02:48.567
every time you'd go to the trash,

02:48.668 --> 02:51.690
you'd associate it with the
divorce and not play in it.

02:51.725 --> 02:52.939
It didn't work.

02:52.974 --> 02:54.909
- Come on, come in.
- It didn't work?

02:54.944 --> 02:57.543
I don't know. I just always
loved trash. It's like...

02:57.644 --> 02:59.412
It's like normal stuff,
but it has a past, you know?

02:59.447 --> 03:03.111
- Hey, welcome home.
- Ooh, it smells good.

03:03.146 --> 03:05.918
Ooh, my God!

03:08.522 --> 03:10.389
Oh, such an only child's room.

03:10.490 --> 03:13.201
- Why?
- There's two TVs.

03:13.236 --> 03:16.529
It was just so I can, like,
stay on top of the news stories.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.999
Yeah, news about what was
happening with Ross and Rachel.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.501
Oh! This is Abbi's little
height chart! I can't stand it!

03:22.602 --> 03:23.903
No, no, that's lead paint.

03:24.004 --> 03:27.606
Yeah, my little girl did
grow up so fast, though.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.308
All right, look, I got three boxes.

03:29.409 --> 03:31.143
Keep, donate, and garbage.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.296
I'm so excited this is happening.

03:33.331 --> 03:35.347
I'm... I'm gonna make
some food for you guys

03:35.449 --> 03:36.981
so you have plenty of
energy to finish, all right?

03:37.016 --> 03:38.266
What kind of snacks you like?

03:38.347 --> 03:39.587
- I...
- No, no! No.

03:39.622 --> 03:41.287
Let me surprise you, huh?

03:41.388 --> 03:42.886
Hope you like stevia.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.391
I don't know if we do.

03:45.492 --> 03:46.358
Oh.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.295
It's the Holocaust
Museum of Abbi Abrams!

03:49.396 --> 03:50.496
What's that mean?

03:50.597 --> 03:52.398
Oh, I mean... I meant museum.

03:52.499 --> 03:55.835
I just... my family only went
to Holocaust Museums as a kid.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.372
Ha. Funny.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.809
Hey, where's Will Smith's playground?

04:07.781 --> 04:11.217

04:11.318 --> 04:13.974
Well, we're technically
in west of Philadelphia,

04:14.009 --> 04:15.354
- so the 'burbs.
- Got it.

04:15.455 --> 04:17.906
Plus, I feel like they shot
it in California, right?

04:17.942 --> 04:19.190
Tax credits.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.192
But there is a rumor that Will Smith

04:21.293 --> 04:23.863
bought his mom a house in my town, so...

04:23.964 --> 04:25.955
I would kill to see that house.

- Ahh! Ew!

What the fuck is this?

04:50.290 --> 04:53.292
It is my dreadlocks, sir.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.261
From your body and head?

04:55.362 --> 04:58.034
Yeah, I tried to donate
them to Locks of Love, but...

04:58.069 --> 04:59.231
Yikes.

04:59.495 --> 05:01.500
- They rejected them, it's fine.
- Yeah, no shit.

05:01.601 --> 05:04.570
Jesus, they stink so much
more than the pictures, God.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.739
Like pepperoni.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.509
Oh, my God. Holy shit!

05:13.980 --> 05:14.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's...

05:15.081 --> 05:16.682
- Do you know who this is?
- Here we go.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.317
This is a first edition

05:18.418 --> 05:20.319
JonBenét Ramsey
commemorative Beanie Baby.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.454
This is more rare than

05:22.556 --> 05:24.377
I ran for this. My heart stopped.

05:24.412 --> 05:25.306
I'm sorry.

05:25.341 --> 05:26.225
All right, look.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.770
Get your palates primes
for my bialy bites.

05:28.805 --> 05:30.663
Aw, I wanted to keep that a surprise.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.097
All right.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.266
This is unreal.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.501
You know, Ilana, you can have it.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.170
I always felt weird about
"getting rid" of her.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.306
Do you even realize what you're saying?

05:40.407 --> 05:42.308
I know you think it's stupid,

05:42.409 --> 05:45.244
but you have to be
aware of the fluctuations

05:45.345 --> 05:46.845
in the Beanie Baby market.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.314
I say it all the time.

05:48.415 --> 05:51.417
This could be our future. Look at her.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.219
Look at me, I'm fully engorged.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.620
Ilana, come on.

05:54.721 --> 05:57.690
I'm not sexually aroused,
I'm fiscally aroused.

05:57.905 --> 05:59.792
- Cool your jets.
- Okay.

05:59.893 --> 06:03.195
The Beanie boards are gonna
light up tonight, baby!

06:03.296 --> 06:05.264
JonBenét, look at her.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.319
You're a star.

06:07.354 --> 06:09.001
Fuck!

06:09.102 --> 06:11.704
Fuck me in fucking face!

06:11.805 --> 06:13.138
This is so bad.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.273
What?

06:14.374 --> 06:17.398
Alice Ackerman was one of my best
friends in middle school, all right?

06:17.433 --> 06:19.512
- I'm following.
- We drifted apart in high school,

06:19.547 --> 06:21.210
mostly because I started smoking weed,

06:21.245 --> 06:23.182
but also because she got in
the varsity field hockey team.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.783
That's normal, it happens,
and that's healthy.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.320
Senior year, she got
hit by a school bus.

06:28.966 --> 06:30.450
On a Saturday.

06:30.485 --> 06:31.657
Shabbat.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.659
So I organized this
entire dance-a-thon

06:33.760 --> 06:35.594
to raise money for her medical bills

06:35.695 --> 06:39.031
and I raised over $900.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.032
That is amazing.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.433
Yeah, really amazing.

06:41.534 --> 06:44.169
Amazing that I fucking
never gave her the money.

06:44.270 --> 06:45.571
Oh, bitch.

06:45.672 --> 06:48.273
You know, it totally makes
perfect sense, typical Abbi.

06:48.374 --> 06:49.925
Senior year is when
I got into mushrooms.

06:49.960 --> 06:54.616
I hear that mushrooms can affect
your memory and your sex drive, right?

06:55.148 --> 06:56.181
Where am I?

06:56.435 --> 06:57.702
I'm just kidding.

07:01.521 --> 07:04.376
She's probably horribly disfigured.

07:04.411 --> 07:07.759
Maybe it's about time
there's an elephant woman.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.728
I did nothing to help this girl.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.163
Nothing!

07:11.264 --> 07:13.131
Was I a terrible person?

07:13.233 --> 07:15.534
You know what?

07:15.635 --> 07:17.336
Maybe, I don't know.

07:17.437 --> 07:21.173
But if we give it back tonight,

07:21.274 --> 07:22.841
you can atone for this.

07:22.942 --> 07:23.909
Yes.

07:23.968 --> 07:27.179
You're right, yes. This is what we're
gonna do. We're gonna do this right now.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.916
Give me one second, I just
fully backlit JonBebé.

07:31.017 --> 07:33.385
She is going on the
Beanie boards tonight.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.053
Yass, yass, yass.

07:35.607 --> 07:38.724
Yass. EBay on fire!

07:38.825 --> 07:39.791
Yes! Natural.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.760
Relax. Nothing.

07:41.861 --> 07:42.761
Gorge, gorge.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.263
Sassy girl.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.560
All right, I'm not gonna say that.

07:45.595 --> 07:46.748
Cool.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.891
Dude, this is so weird.

07:48.929 --> 07:50.296
We're just gonna, like, show up

07:50.397 --> 07:53.020
at her family's bowling
alley just hoping she's there?

07:53.055 --> 07:54.867
You know, you don't
need to wear a helmet.

07:54.968 --> 07:56.269
I'm a very good driver.

07:56.370 --> 08:00.223
It is insane that you
drive a car with no doors.

08:00.258 --> 08:04.510
You are such a goy for driving
this car, it is unbelievable.

08:04.611 --> 08:06.846
I want a DNA test.

08:07.476 --> 08:09.748
Okay, do you think Will
Smith's mom lives around here?

08:09.850 --> 08:11.884
By the bowling alley? No.

08:11.985 --> 08:14.887
Will would buy, like,
a much better spot.

08:14.988 --> 08:17.323
♪

08:18.992 --> 08:21.327
No shoes, no entrance.

08:21.428 --> 08:24.597
Yes, you, the Jews.

08:25.154 --> 08:26.499
I'm... we're not even bowling...

08:26.600 --> 08:27.566
Hep!

08:27.667 --> 08:29.435
- Dude.
- Come on.

08:29.536 --> 08:30.536
Tiptoe, please.

08:30.637 --> 08:33.806
Oh, God. Okay.

08:33.907 --> 08:35.438
Thank you.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.775
Um, yes, we just want to
ask a quick question, so...

08:37.878 --> 08:41.244
You need shoes to get in.
New floors. 25 bucks each.

08:41.481 --> 08:42.881
Cash only.

08:42.982 --> 08:45.851
- Okay.
- Dude, I don't "carry cash."

08:45.952 --> 08:47.353
Oh, okay.

08:47.454 --> 08:49.188
This is terrible.

08:49.289 --> 08:52.258
But we could use some of the
money from the Alice fund.

08:52.359 --> 08:53.526
It's, like, for her.

08:53.627 --> 08:56.161
We're using her money
to get her the money.

08:56.263 --> 08:57.329
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

08:57.430 --> 08:59.026
- Okay, that makes total sense.
- Total sense.

08:59.061 --> 09:00.994
- So we have to.
- Have to, must.

09:01.368 --> 09:03.369
Okay.

09:03.470 --> 09:05.104
Sir.

09:05.205 --> 09:06.472
What size?

09:06.573 --> 09:08.106
I'm a four. Four-and-a-half.

09:08.141 --> 09:11.410
Um, 11.

09:12.654 --> 09:14.880
Oh, my God!

09:15.515 --> 09:19.385
I didn't realize that it's the 20th
anniversary of JonBenét's death.

09:19.486 --> 09:21.620
- Whoa.
- Dude, it is blowing up on eBay.

09:21.721 --> 09:23.155
It's gonna double our value.

09:23.256 --> 09:25.190
Jeez.

09:25.292 --> 09:26.732
That's awesome, dude.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.227
Abbi?

09:28.668 --> 09:31.330
Ooh. Townie boy, get 'dat.

09:32.643 --> 09:33.732
- Hi.
- Abbi Abrams?

09:33.833 --> 09:36.046
Yeah, well, give me your bottom line
and I'll see what kind of mood I'm in.

09:36.081 --> 09:38.370
It's me, it's Karl Shiff.

09:38.471 --> 09:39.572
Uh...

09:40.707 --> 09:42.641
Shyffilis. Sh... Shyffilis.

09:42.742 --> 09:45.077
- Holy shit, Shyffilis!
- Yeah!

09:45.178 --> 09:47.379
Jeez, you look so good.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.348
- No, you look great.
- Thanks.

09:49.449 --> 09:50.783
You're still using Shyffilis, huh?

09:50.884 --> 09:53.172
Well, I mean, it's not really
a name you can get away from.

09:53.207 --> 09:54.787
- Yeah.
- It even followed me to the office.

09:54.888 --> 09:55.540
Whoa.

09:55.722 --> 09:57.656
Who knew that one day
at Colonial Williamsburg

09:57.757 --> 09:59.019
could change your life, you know?

09:59.054 --> 10:02.186
I mean, name-wise. Unless you're
like a history teacher or whatever.

10:02.349 --> 10:03.729
Oh, my God, wait.

10:03.830 --> 10:06.432
Did I have something
to do with that... name?

10:06.533 --> 10:07.733
Oh, yeah.

10:07.834 --> 10:09.602
Yeah, that was totally your fault, 100%.

10:09.703 --> 10:12.162
- Oh... oh, God.
- Yeah, no, it's fine, it's fine.

10:12.287 --> 10:14.338
- No, we were in the same walking group.
- Yeah.

10:14.373 --> 10:17.142
I remember, we learned about the
syphilis outbreak in the colony

10:17.243 --> 10:19.034
and it just sounded
so much like your name.

10:19.069 --> 10:21.225
- Exactly like my name.
- Wait, I am so sorry.

10:21.302 --> 10:23.182
I need to atone for this.

10:23.283 --> 10:26.552
I would never, ever have said
that if I knew it would stick.

10:26.653 --> 10:28.053
Really, it's fine.

10:28.154 --> 10:30.856
And I didn't even care, like,
at all, because it was you.

10:30.957 --> 10:31.991
What... what?

10:31.992 --> 10:34.239
I had, like, a huge crush on you
in high school. You knew that.

10:34.274 --> 10:36.028
No, I did not.

10:36.129 --> 10:37.563
What? Oh, whoops.

10:37.664 --> 10:38.920
No, I didn't.

10:38.955 --> 10:40.165
- Um, yeah.
- I mean, I didn't.

10:40.266 --> 10:43.369
But, I mean, if you really want
to make up for it, you could...

10:43.470 --> 10:44.637
You could buy me a drink.

10:44.738 --> 10:46.725
- I love drinks.
- You got any cash?

10:46.760 --> 10:48.407
Cash only, this place, huh?

10:48.508 --> 10:49.742
Oh, um...

10:49.843 --> 10:53.012
I... yeah, I do have some cash.

10:53.406 --> 10:54.913
Can I?

10:55.313 --> 10:56.657
Well,

10:56.658 --> 11:00.875
the appreciated value of JonBenét now
compared to five years ago is astounding.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.657
You should be honored. I'm wasting
my time with a yellow star user?

11:04.758 --> 11:06.859
I'm a turquoise power seller, bitch.

11:08.395 --> 11:10.062

five years ago in Miami.

You think I'm a fucking idiot?

11:25.879 --> 11:28.847
You think I'm MrBubbles9560?

11:34.854 --> 11:38.223
Nope, you're dealing with me, bitch.

11:41.461 --> 11:44.063
You know, I've always fantasized about,
like, making out in a locker room,

11:44.164 --> 11:46.198
but no one ever tells you
about the feet smell, right?

11:46.299 --> 11:48.002
- That's true.
- It's like, gross.

11:48.037 --> 11:49.413
You're adorable.

11:55.442 --> 11:56.975
I'll return these.

11:57.077 --> 12:00.005
Um, are any of the Ackermans
around, by any chance?

12:00.040 --> 12:01.246
Oh, no.

12:01.347 --> 12:02.872
They sold the place years ago.

12:02.907 --> 12:05.084
Their daughter was in
a horrific accident.

12:05.185 --> 12:06.885
They needed all the cash they could get.

12:06.986 --> 12:09.022
- Sad story.
- Yeah, Alice.

12:09.057 --> 12:11.098
Do you know where she lives?
I went to high school with her.

12:11.133 --> 12:13.290
Oh, yeah. She lives in that
house at the end of Henderson.

12:13.325 --> 12:15.828
- Can't miss it.
- The house at the end of Henderson.

12:15.863 --> 12:17.772
- Yeah.
- By the convention center?

12:17.807 --> 12:19.398
- Mm-hmm. -
That Henderson?

12:19.499 --> 12:20.716
There's only one.

12:21.568 --> 12:23.001
You were such a dick earlier

12:23.103 --> 12:25.904
and now you are maybe
one of my favorite people.

One, this bad boy gave me the address.

12:41.154 --> 12:42.221
Oh, my God, thank you.

12:42.322 --> 12:44.590
Yeah, two, you speak Chinese?

12:44.691 --> 12:46.000
What's going on?

12:46.035 --> 12:48.782
Hardly, Just some Yiddish
Mandarin I picked up from my mom.

12:48.817 --> 12:49.913
See ya.

a fucking cab or something?

No, bro, follow me.

Yes, sir.

Hey, what up, my peers?

13:12.351 --> 13:14.482

So, listen, guys, my Jeep stalled.

I was wondering if you guys can
give us a ride to our friend's house.

13:24.052 --> 13:25.397
Yeah, we could.

13:25.498 --> 13:27.165
If you could buy us some liquor.

13:27.267 --> 13:29.016
Oof. Tit for tat.

13:29.335 --> 13:30.534
Savvy.

You're very tall.

16:43.290 --> 16:44.991
You remember my accident, right?

16:45.092 --> 16:46.959
I mean, I kinda remember it a little.

16:47.060 --> 16:50.096
Yeah, well, they had to
put pins in my thighs,

16:50.197 --> 16:52.865
and so it elongated me
and added three inches

16:52.966 --> 16:53.899
to my height.

16:54.001 --> 16:55.334
And then after that I...

16:55.435 --> 16:57.436
I just couldn't keep the weight on.

16:57.537 --> 16:58.788
- Totally.
- I feel that.

16:58.823 --> 17:00.909
- Understand.
- So I started modeling.

17:00.944 --> 17:03.509
And ten campaigns later...

17:03.610 --> 17:06.846
Wow, not too shabby.

17:06.946 --> 17:09.682
What about you? What...
why are you here?

17:09.782 --> 17:11.117
Good call.

17:11.218 --> 17:12.917
Speaking of the accident,

17:13.020 --> 17:14.185
I do remember

17:14.288 --> 17:17.857
and I actually raised
some money for your surgery

17:18.298 --> 17:21.362
by throwing a dance-a-thon.
We danced for all night.

17:21.522 --> 17:24.463
I mean, I was in a coma at
the time, but I heard about it,

17:24.564 --> 17:26.766
and I never got the chance to thank you,

17:26.867 --> 17:28.567
so that was really sweet of you, Abbi.

17:28.669 --> 17:30.020
You're a good person.

17:30.055 --> 17:31.941
- Huh? Well...
- It's true.

17:31.976 --> 17:33.079
- Yeah.
- It's true.

17:33.114 --> 17:33.988
- Yeah.
- It's true.

17:34.023 --> 17:35.027
- Thank you.
- It is.

17:35.062 --> 17:37.421
You know, thank you,
Alice. I appreciate that.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.844
Funny story.

17:38.945 --> 17:40.379
You're gonna be like...

17:41.315 --> 17:43.949
- L-O-L. -
Abbi, you crazy.

17:44.051 --> 17:46.686
You're gonna be like, what?

17:46.787 --> 17:48.754
So I was home,

17:48.855 --> 17:50.056
and I found this envelope

17:50.157 --> 17:53.459
and it's actually all the
money from the dance-a-thon.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.302
I never gave it to you.

17:55.358 --> 17:57.596
- And it's crazy.
- Well, I'll take it now.

17:57.698 --> 17:58.998
- You take now.
- Thanks.

17:59.099 --> 18:00.966
- And you know what, do something...
- Some extra cash.

18:01.068 --> 18:04.905
Buy something nice for this
place, 'cause it needs a...

18:05.246 --> 18:06.250
Okay.

18:07.118 --> 18:10.518
It says here that you raised
$946, and there's only $300 here.

18:10.553 --> 18:11.744
Does it say that?

18:11.845 --> 18:13.879
Well, it was just because we
needed the cash to find you.

18:13.980 --> 18:16.148
We just needed the
money for bowling shoes

18:16.249 --> 18:18.117
and bottles of liquor for teens.

18:18.218 --> 18:19.251
You're not on Facebook.

18:19.353 --> 18:20.586
This is really fucked up, Abbi,

18:20.687 --> 18:22.888
you coming here and
bringing up my accident

18:22.989 --> 18:24.757
and giving me money eight years later

18:24.858 --> 18:26.525
- that's not even all there.
- Okay.

18:26.626 --> 18:28.794
Um, I just... I wanted to...

18:28.895 --> 18:31.298
You know what? I take it back,
actually, you're not a good person.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.514
You're kind of an asshole, Abbi!

18:34.480 --> 18:36.054
- Well, I thought...
- No.

18:36.089 --> 18:38.137
Abbi is a phenomenal person.

18:38.238 --> 18:40.306
Okay, a high-quality human being.

18:40.407 --> 18:44.310
Because she... wanted to come here

18:44.411 --> 18:46.812
and give this extremely valuable

18:46.913 --> 18:49.582
first edition commemorative

18:49.683 --> 18:51.851
JonBenét Ramsay Beanie Baby.

18:51.952 --> 18:53.152
What?

18:53.253 --> 18:54.587
That's a Beanie Baby of a dead girl.

18:54.688 --> 18:56.055
That's disgusting.

18:56.156 --> 18:58.090
Okay, Alice, just hear me out, okay?

18:58.191 --> 19:01.427
I came here to look you
in the eye and to atone.

19:01.528 --> 19:02.661
I am a good person.

19:02.763 --> 19:04.830
- You know me, when we sat next to...
- Whoa! Wait, wait, wait.

19:04.931 --> 19:06.832
Wait, wait, wait,
just, wait, wait, baby.

19:06.933 --> 19:08.200
Baby, just wait one second,

19:08.301 --> 19:09.435
I'm gonna come down
there, I'm gonna explain.

19:09.536 --> 19:10.885
Explain what?

19:11.191 --> 19:14.288
Nothing. There is
nothing to explain. What?

19:14.323 --> 19:15.784
- What's going on here?
- She just...

19:15.819 --> 19:17.330
She made out with me a little
bit at the bowling alley.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.462
- No, no.
- You did?

19:18.497 --> 19:19.486
It's not her fault.

19:19.521 --> 19:20.746
I didn't make out with
you, you made out with me!

19:20.847 --> 19:23.215
We were talking about... She
had a crush on me and stuff.

19:23.316 --> 19:26.161
Shyffilis, I swear to fucking
God, you know you've done...

19:26.196 --> 19:27.787
This is your fucking luck?

19:27.888 --> 19:29.587
- Get your fucking ass upstairs.
- Okay, okay.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.123
- It's the second strike today.
- I know.

19:31.224 --> 19:32.958
- I'm sorry.
- Today?

19:33.059 --> 19:34.799
- Get your ass upstairs.
- Okay, I'm gone.

19:34.991 --> 19:36.662
- Get out.
- It was just...

19:36.663 --> 19:37.930
- Okay, so we should really talk.
- Good night.

19:38.031 --> 19:39.444
We should talk about the...

19:39.479 --> 19:41.367
Shyffilis, I'm gonna
kick your fucking ass.

19:42.060 --> 19:44.036
Ugh, I just feel terrible.

19:44.137 --> 19:45.560
You really shouldn't.

19:45.872 --> 19:49.341
That Beanie Baby was worth over $13,000
depending on the strength of the yen.

19:49.443 --> 19:51.577
Wait, what?

19:51.678 --> 19:53.537
- Yeah.
- What?

19:53.572 --> 19:54.613
Yeah.

19:54.714 --> 19:56.352
- Dude...
- Come on.

19:56.526 --> 19:58.002
- It's over.
- Fuck.

20:21.280 --> 20:25.015
Aah, I am so happy
you two guys came down.

20:25.050 --> 20:27.283
- Thank you.
- Abbi, I love when you're home.

20:27.953 --> 20:31.289
Whoa, how's work, training Shania Twain?

20:31.390 --> 20:34.058
- Wow.
- How is that?

20:34.757 --> 20:36.661
It's so good.

20:36.762 --> 20:37.829
Hey, by the way.

20:37.930 --> 20:40.905
Last night, after you left,
I looked up Alice Ackerman.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.076
You know what I found out on Google?

20:43.111 --> 20:46.356
She bought her house
from Will Smith's mom!

20:46.391 --> 20:47.475
Ahh!

20:48.727 --> 20:52.195
I'm so sorry.
