WEBVTT

00:01.370 --> 00:03.580
[grunting]

00:03.580 --> 00:06.580
No matter how many times
I climb these stairs,

00:06.580 --> 00:08.630
I swear they're
gettin' taller. Heh-heh.

00:08.630 --> 00:10.630
Oh... [grunts]

00:10.630 --> 00:12.420
We're just getting older.

00:12.420 --> 00:16.040
Oh, boy. That market sure was
a mess today, wasn't it?

00:16.040 --> 00:17.420
Oh, my goodness, yes!

00:17.420 --> 00:19.830
Ever since those monsters
started showing up,

00:19.830 --> 00:22.460
hogging the aisles
with their giant
shopping carts...

00:22.460 --> 00:24.170
Now, if I had any say, I'd--

00:24.170 --> 00:27.330
Manny! Mendel!
Quit doddling!

00:27.330 --> 00:28.750
Hey, Mom,
I found a dead lizard!

00:28.750 --> 00:29.750
I wanna keep it!

00:29.750 --> 00:31.420
Can we name him "Chomps"?

00:31.420 --> 00:36.000
[sighs] OK, but...
only if you finish your chores.

00:41.040 --> 00:44.960
[breathes deeply] All right.
You guys know the drill.

00:44.960 --> 00:48.210
[grunting]
Your back OK, dear?

00:48.210 --> 00:49.330
[struggling] Yeah.
Yeah, that's fine, honey.

00:49.330 --> 00:53.370
Whoa! Whoa-oa! Whuh--! Whoa!

00:54.580 --> 00:57.080
[grunting]

00:57.080 --> 00:59.000
[all exclaiming]

01:01.330 --> 01:02.330
Huh?

01:02.330 --> 01:04.420
-Oh, my!
-Whoa!

01:04.420 --> 01:08.080
Sorry. We're not interested.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.630
Wait! What are you doing
in our house?

01:10.630 --> 01:14.500
Uh, actually,
this is our house.

01:14.500 --> 01:18.420
It belonged to my great, great,
great, great, great grandmother

01:18.420 --> 01:21.250
before the Mewmans went
and took over these woods.

01:21.250 --> 01:25.000
Now Eclipsa's returned it
back to us by royal decree.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.500
[Monster Mim]
See?

01:26.500 --> 01:28.290
Well, that sounds like
a whole lot of malarkey!

01:28.290 --> 01:31.670
If this is your house,
why don't ya prove it?

01:31.670 --> 01:36.210
Well, it's a monster house.

01:36.210 --> 01:39.710
Everything is... monster-sized.

01:39.710 --> 01:42.750
Didn't you wonder why
the rooms were so big?

01:42.750 --> 01:46.500
Or the furniture,
or the kitchen sink?

01:46.500 --> 01:49.080
You mean, the swimming pool?

01:49.080 --> 01:52.540
[sighs] Look, I gotta
get ready for work.

01:52.540 --> 01:56.420
But we packed up your stuff
for ya!

01:56.420 --> 01:58.750
[Monster Mim] I think
this is everything.
Here you go!

02:00.540 --> 02:04.790
Well, this is awkward.

02:04.790 --> 02:05.790
Goodbye.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.580
Now, what do we do?

02:11.170 --> 02:12.500
Look at it this way, kids.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.920
At least we don't have to
live in town

02:13.920 --> 02:15.580
with a bunch of monsters
anymore!

02:15.580 --> 02:17.080
This is literally
the first time

02:17.080 --> 02:18.790
I've seen a tree
in my life.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.870
You know... me, too!

02:22.000 --> 02:27.370
[King River groaning]

02:27.370 --> 02:29.420
Do you have to do that?

02:29.420 --> 02:33.370
Aah! Moon Pie, I'm bored!

02:33.370 --> 02:36.170
River, that's the point.
We came here to the woods

02:36.170 --> 02:39.210
just to spend time
and do nothing.

02:39.210 --> 02:41.500
Besides, I thought
you were cooking.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.000
I am!

02:43.000 --> 02:44.580
[Queen Moon]
Sweetie, those are rocks.

02:44.580 --> 02:47.670
Can't you find anything
more... edible to cook?

02:50.330 --> 02:52.170
Your Majesty? It's really you!

02:52.170 --> 02:53.670
-[Maude gasps]
-Oh, my goodness!

02:53.670 --> 02:56.290
Uh, hello. Do I know you?

02:56.290 --> 02:59.580
Well, not personally.
My name is Merrick Maizley.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.370
I was in the A-Corn-ting
Department.

03:01.370 --> 03:02.460
In the Royal Fields Office.

03:02.460 --> 03:04.040
Ah! Thank you for your service.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.420
Your Majesty.
Yo-you have to help us.

03:06.420 --> 03:10.210
Monsters have taken over
our homes, and we need them
gone at once.

03:10.210 --> 03:13.460
Well, I'm afraid I'm not
"Your Majesty" anymore.

03:13.460 --> 03:16.500
Eclipsa is queen now.
There's nothing I can do.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.870
But then... what are we
supposed to do?

03:18.870 --> 03:22.580
You could move?
It seems like you've got
your belongings with you.

03:22.580 --> 03:24.000
You're off to a great start!

03:25.630 --> 03:28.670
OK, then.
We'll leave you to this.

03:30.670 --> 03:32.170
Thank you!

03:35.580 --> 03:38.540
Moon, would you be a dear
and fetch some water
for the soup?

03:38.540 --> 03:40.750
Soup? What's in it?

03:40.750 --> 03:43.250
I've, uh, got this... meat!

03:43.250 --> 03:45.580
[grunts] That's a bundle of--

03:45.580 --> 03:46.330
Oh, never mind.

03:48.670 --> 03:52.040
[King River]
Hurry, my dear!
The meat wood is burning!

03:52.040 --> 03:53.080
What in--?

03:55.080 --> 03:57.460
[King River]
Whoops, there it goes.
It's on fire now.

03:57.460 --> 03:58.460
Soup's canceled!

04:01.250 --> 04:02.250
[gasps]

04:04.040 --> 04:07.330
[gasps] Your Majesty! Hi!

04:07.330 --> 04:09.290
What's going on here?

04:09.290 --> 04:10.830
Oh! [chuckles]

04:10.830 --> 04:12.500
Well, we got a little bit
turned around

04:12.500 --> 04:14.330
and then fell into
a gelatinous slime gulch.

04:14.330 --> 04:16.540
This stuff is disgusting.

04:16.540 --> 04:19.710
Yes, well, unfortunately,
the slime has contaminated
our water.

04:19.710 --> 04:22.330
I'd recommend cleaning up
further away.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.420
Far, far, further away.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.460
OK, if we close our eyes,
this might pass as spaghetti.

04:29.460 --> 04:30.460
River, you can't just--

04:30.460 --> 04:31.500
Just let me eat this!

04:31.500 --> 04:33.460
[grumbles]
What's all this?

04:34.750 --> 04:39.500
Look at my clean babies!
Get between your toes!

04:39.500 --> 04:42.460
So, I see you moved
further down stream.

04:42.460 --> 04:44.540
Sure did! Thanks for the tip!

04:44.540 --> 04:46.830
The water is so clean
and pure here!

04:46.830 --> 04:48.790
-Oh!
-Uh, where are they going?

04:48.790 --> 04:51.080
Oh, who knows! [snorts]
Kids, who cares?

04:51.080 --> 04:54.500
Hey! You wanna bet
I can scream really loud?

04:54.500 --> 04:55.630
No!

04:55.630 --> 04:56.960
Well, I'm glad you're OK,

04:56.960 --> 04:58.750
but this is actually
private property, so--

04:58.750 --> 05:01.580
[screaming]

05:01.580 --> 05:03.330
What-- what's that?

05:03.330 --> 05:05.210
-Uh, I said this is private--
-[Manny screaming]

05:05.210 --> 05:06.630
Sorry, I-- I didn't
catch that over the screaming.

05:06.630 --> 05:09.130
-I said--
-[Manny screaming]

05:09.130 --> 05:11.420
Get off our property!

05:12.710 --> 05:15.420
Well. You didn't have to yell.

05:19.670 --> 05:22.670
[sighs] Beautiful peace
and quiet.

05:22.670 --> 05:26.540
Hi! I know you probably want
your peace and quiet-- [laughs]

05:26.540 --> 05:29.500
--but I've got
a really quick question for ya.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.420
[sighs] Go see what he wants.

05:31.420 --> 05:34.170
Why me? I've got all the wood
for the fence!

05:34.170 --> 05:36.540
I gave birth to our child.

05:36.540 --> 05:38.500
[groans]

05:38.500 --> 05:40.580
Hm. I can't believe
that still works.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.290
What do you want?

05:43.290 --> 05:45.790
Um, so, uh, my kids found this.

05:45.790 --> 05:47.330
Is this safe to eat?

05:47.330 --> 05:48.670
Aah! No, no, no!

05:48.670 --> 05:50.750
That's a Carnian Spirring
Lizard Egg!

05:50.750 --> 05:52.420
They're the most poisonous
creatures in all of--

05:52.420 --> 05:54.420
Oh, what? Oops!

05:54.420 --> 05:57.210
[yelps] Aah!

05:57.210 --> 05:58.670
[screaming]

05:58.670 --> 06:01.170
Oh, here!
Maybe this'll distract 'em.

06:02.750 --> 06:05.290
OK, Maude, you were right.
The eggs were bad.

06:05.290 --> 06:08.370
[screaming]
It burns! Aah!

06:08.370 --> 06:10.040
[growling]

06:12.750 --> 06:18.710
-[King River snoring]
-[nearby clanging]

06:18.710 --> 06:20.630
[growls] That's it!

06:20.630 --> 06:22.080
-[clanging]
-What are you doing?!

06:22.080 --> 06:23.790
It's the middle of the night!

06:23.790 --> 06:26.580
Oh, we're protecting you
from the Hookman.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.040
Cute nightgown.

06:28.040 --> 06:31.130
On full moons,
he wanders the forest,

06:31.130 --> 06:33.750
finding unsuspecting victims
to hook!

06:33.750 --> 06:36.670
The only way to stay safe
is to be loud!

06:37.710 --> 06:40.210
Please, just leave us alone.

06:40.210 --> 06:41.670
We'll make noise in shifts.

06:41.670 --> 06:43.790
That way, there'll be
constant loud noises

06:43.790 --> 06:46.080
all the way
until the sun rises!

06:46.080 --> 06:49.460
-[Merrick] Heh. Now, Maude,
I know you brought all the--
-[growls] Leave!

06:49.460 --> 06:50.460
[Merrick]
--but I was thinking...

06:50.460 --> 06:52.870
I... have... had it...

06:52.870 --> 06:54.750
with you!

06:54.750 --> 06:56.670
Leave now!

06:56.670 --> 07:00.420
Leave! Leave now! Leave!

07:06.630 --> 07:07.830
[gasps] Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

07:07.830 --> 07:09.040
Honey, guess what!

07:09.040 --> 07:10.870
I can see out of one eye
again, and--

07:10.870 --> 07:14.130
[gasping]
Have you been making pies?

07:14.130 --> 07:16.540
Yes! I've been up all night

07:16.540 --> 07:19.960
preparing a special treat
for the Maizleys. Hyah!

07:22.750 --> 07:25.710
Strawberry death pies!
You are a genius.

07:25.710 --> 07:26.920
I love you.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.670
Oh, you like that, do you?

07:28.670 --> 07:31.080
Then you'll love this!

07:31.080 --> 07:33.500
[gasps] A pie catapult!

07:33.500 --> 07:36.210
You haven't built one
since we were dating!

07:36.210 --> 07:37.710
I-- I couldn't sleep
last night.

07:37.710 --> 07:39.250
Because it occurred to me,

07:39.250 --> 07:40.830
they're just going
to keep coming back.

07:40.830 --> 07:41.870
No matter what we do.

07:41.870 --> 07:43.710
If we want to get back
to doing nothing,

07:43.710 --> 07:45.210
we've got to do something.

07:45.210 --> 07:47.830
Behold, our new moat!

07:47.830 --> 07:49.830
[all groan]

07:49.830 --> 07:51.210
You caught alligators?!

07:51.210 --> 07:54.790
I speak alligator! Waah!

07:54.790 --> 07:56.750
-[alligators groan]
-Waah!

07:56.750 --> 07:59.460
-[groaning continues]
-To the watchtower!

07:59.460 --> 08:02.250
[gasps] We have
a watchtower?! [panting]

08:09.920 --> 08:12.170
Hmm.

08:12.170 --> 08:16.000
You don't think
the Hookman got them, do you?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.750
River, the Hookman isn't real.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.330
Oh, right.

08:22.330 --> 08:25.170
Then, they must be busy, uh...

08:25.170 --> 08:27.290
plotting something.

08:27.290 --> 08:30.130
Yes. Perhaps we should...
go...

08:30.130 --> 08:32.080
see what they're plotting!

08:32.080 --> 08:35.750
-Maizleys! Maude!
-Children! Merrick!

08:35.750 --> 08:38.460
-[groans] Annoying children!
-Merrick!

08:38.460 --> 08:41.630
-Children!
-Are you annoying someone
nearby?

08:41.630 --> 08:43.170
Maizl-- [gasps]

08:44.210 --> 08:45.870
Hey! Wait!

08:45.870 --> 08:49.960
Maizleys! We've been looking
everywhere for you.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.920
Where have you been?

08:51.920 --> 08:55.210
Well, heh, we didn't
want to trouble you anymore.

08:55.210 --> 08:57.290
So, we went looking
for a new home.

08:57.290 --> 08:59.370
But we couldn't see,
'cause it was pitch black
outside,

08:59.370 --> 09:01.870
which is, like, pretty cool,
but was, like, also
kinda the worst.

09:01.870 --> 09:04.420
But what happened
to your belongings?

09:04.420 --> 09:05.830
Oh, squirrels stole 'em.

09:05.830 --> 09:08.500
And moths ate
all our spare clothes.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.920
Then we, um,
fell down a mountain

09:10.920 --> 09:15.790
and got stuck real bad
in some quicksand,
and, then, uh--

09:15.790 --> 09:17.960
The Hookman got us.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.040
[gasps] What?!

09:19.040 --> 09:21.330
Oh, it was terrible.

09:21.330 --> 09:23.870
He hooked us into buying
homeowner insurance.

09:23.870 --> 09:26.370
But you guys don't own a home!

09:26.370 --> 09:28.920
Yeah! Ha ha, he's good.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.080
Haven't any of you ever learned
to take care of yourselves?

09:32.080 --> 09:34.750
Well, no, Your Majesty.

09:34.750 --> 09:37.290
We've never had to before.

09:37.290 --> 09:39.630
You always took
such good care of us.

09:39.630 --> 09:41.830
You gave us good jobs
and a nice home.

09:41.830 --> 09:45.710
Mm, but ever since you left,
I don't know what we'll do.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.960
Anyway, we'll get
out of your hair.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.960
We'll find a hole somewhere
to live. Heh.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.000
Maybe live off berries.
How's that sound, kids?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.630
[flatly]
Yah, berries.

10:02.000 --> 10:02.960
[Queen Moon]
Wait.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.830
Maybe we can help.

10:07.420 --> 10:10.040
And that's how you grow
real food.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.080
Food. From the ground.

10:12.080 --> 10:15.790
Are ya pullin' my leg or what?
[laughs] That's crazy!

10:15.790 --> 10:18.170
You have to get
the perfect burn color.

10:18.170 --> 10:20.750
Aaand... now!

10:22.210 --> 10:23.330
You're a natural!

10:23.330 --> 10:24.540
Aw, thanks!

10:26.040 --> 10:27.870
[grunting]

10:27.870 --> 10:29.420
[both grunt]
