WEBVTT

00:07.634 --> 00:10.467
My name is melinda gordon.

00:11.734 --> 00:12.901
I just got married,

00:12.967 --> 00:14.368
just moved to
a small town,

00:14.433 --> 00:16.201
just opened up
an antiques shop

00:16.268 --> 00:19.268
i might be just like you.

00:19.334 --> 00:21.567
Except from the time
that i was a little girl,

00:21.634 --> 00:23.234
i knew that i could
talk to the dead.

00:24.301 --> 00:25.767
Grandma:
It's all right, honey.

00:25.834 --> 00:28.967
Earthbound spirits,
my gramother called them.

00:29.034 --> 00:30.400
The ones who have not
crossed over yet

00:30.467 --> 00:32.700
because they have unfinished
business with the living,

00:32.767 --> 00:35.101
and they come to me
for help.

00:35.167 --> 00:36.301
To tell you my story,

00:36.368 --> 00:38.268
i have to tell you theirs.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.667
ok. We're here.

00:59.734 --> 01:02.467
Now remember, you are
all to stay together.

01:02.500 --> 01:05.800
Do not leave
the immediate area
of the farmers market

01:05.867 --> 01:08.301
or you will lose
yo outdoor privileges.

01:08.368 --> 01:10.001
Now, we had our little
problems last time...

01:10.067 --> 01:13.167
are you still there?

01:13.234 --> 01:15.368
You better be.

01:15.433 --> 01:17.101
I don't want
to do this alone.

01:20.368 --> 01:22.901
Ok, everybody,
watch your steps.

01:22.967 --> 01:24.234
Over this way.

01:24.301 --> 01:25.667
Go over to the left.

01:25.734 --> 01:26.867
James, come on.

01:36.567 --> 01:37.901
What's the big deal?

01:37.967 --> 01:39.134
It's just a casual
dinner some night.

01:39.201 --> 01:42.268
And i gave up blind dates
a long time ago.

01:42.334 --> 01:43.867
Jim says he has
a great personality.

01:45.167 --> 01:46.101
Isn't that code
for, like,

01:46.167 --> 01:47.867
"chubby in
a comb over?"

01:47.934 --> 01:49.368
Firemen are hot.

01:49.433 --> 01:52.201
That's all you should
be thinking about.

01:52.268 --> 01:53.201
Ok.

01:53.268 --> 01:55.301
Wait. No.

01:55.368 --> 01:56.834
Maybe.

01:56.901 --> 01:58.467
Have you always been
this decisive?

01:58.533 --> 02:01.234
I'm not sure.

02:01.301 --> 02:02.400
Hey, who's that?

02:02.467 --> 02:05.834
Very smooth change
of subject. Well done.

02:05.901 --> 02:07.368
Is this your grandmother?

02:07.433 --> 02:09.300
Wow. She looks
exactly like you.

02:09.368 --> 02:11.467
In fact, i think i've seen this
bathing suit in your closet.

02:11.533 --> 02:14.467
She was very special.

02:14.533 --> 02:15.734
I miss her.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.700
Like, "special" special?

02:20.334 --> 02:23.667
Her birthday is sunday.
She would have been 80.

02:26.234 --> 02:27.368
Hello.
May i help you?

02:27.433 --> 02:31.667
No. Um... yeah.
Do you guys have a bathroom?

02:31.734 --> 02:34.867
Sure. There's one
in the back.

02:34.934 --> 02:37.201
I'll show you.

02:37.268 --> 02:39.001
Big mistake, sister.

02:39.067 --> 02:41.934
Bathrooms are always
the first place they look.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.533
Whoa.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.901
You can see me,
can't you?

02:50.967 --> 02:52.368
Yeah.

02:54.667 --> 02:55.600
Wow.

02:55.667 --> 02:57.967
Twins.
Duh.

02:59.134 --> 03:00.268
I'm sorry, ladies.

03:00.334 --> 03:01.400
Did a young girl
come in here?

03:01.467 --> 03:02.867
Pale-looking, pretty,

03:02.934 --> 03:04.234
probably seemed
a little nervous.

03:04.301 --> 03:05.800
Don't tell him.

03:07.134 --> 03:08.834
Look, she's a patient
at a psychiatric clinic.

03:08.901 --> 03:11.567
If you're trying to hide her,
it's a mistake.

03:11.634 --> 03:13.734
[Sighs]
She's in the bathroom
in the back.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.834
This way? Thank you.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.301
My god.
Poor girl.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.433
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.734
He's gonna drag her
straight back to
the cuckoo's nest, you know.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.600
Let go.
You're hurting me.

03:26.667 --> 03:27.800
You know
i'm not.

03:27.867 --> 03:29.533
Please. Don't take me
back to that place.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.767
You know what, nat?

03:30.834 --> 03:31.700
I really don't want to
go back there, either,

03:31.767 --> 03:32.901
but what are
we gonna do?

03:32.967 --> 03:34.734
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

03:36.634 --> 03:39.634
I'm sorry.
I had no choice.

03:39.700 --> 03:41.001
Whatever.

03:42.967 --> 03:45.500
So...

03:47.967 --> 03:48.967
are we with ghost?

03:49.034 --> 03:50.467
What the hell
are you looking at?

03:50.533 --> 03:51.967
Oh, yeah.

03:52.034 --> 03:54.334
We are with ghost.

04:34.734 --> 04:36.901
so you're just gonna ignore
this whole situation?

04:36.967 --> 04:38.500
I was
hoping to, yes.

04:38.567 --> 04:40.233
I have lunch plans
with my husband.

04:40.300 --> 04:42.034
Why did you have to
rat out my sister?

04:42.101 --> 04:43.834
I wasn't about to lie.

04:43.901 --> 04:46.200
For all i know,
the clinic is a safe place for
your sister to be right now.

04:46.267 --> 04:47.233
Well, it's not.

04:47.300 --> 04:48.367
Why don't you try
and help

04:48.434 --> 04:49.667
instead of passing
judgment?

04:49.734 --> 04:51.200
I don't pass judgment
on anyone.

04:51.267 --> 04:52.567
And did it ever occur
to you that maybe

04:52.634 --> 04:54.300
you're the reason she's there
in the first place?

04:54.367 --> 04:56.534
I mean, attaching
yourself to her?

04:56.600 --> 04:57.901
I'm the only reason
my sister

04:57.967 --> 05:00.168
hasn't completely
lost it in there.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.001
We'll agree to disagree.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.634
Look, if you want
to cross over,

05:03.701 --> 05:04.667
i'll be glad to help you.

05:04.734 --> 05:07.500
You mean, like,
go to the light?

05:07.567 --> 05:08.701
Not an option.

05:08.767 --> 05:09.834
My sister needs me.

05:09.901 --> 05:11.467
She's barely half
a person without me.

05:11.534 --> 05:12.667
I've gotta get her
outta there.

05:12.734 --> 05:13.967
What do you
expect me to do?

05:22.801 --> 05:24.701
I cannot interfere
in your sister's treatment.

05:24.767 --> 05:26.300
It is not my place.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.600
I'm sorry.
I really am.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.168
By the way,

05:30.233 --> 05:33.300
my sister grabbed some
fancy letter opener
off your counter.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.767
So, if she does
something,

05:35.834 --> 05:39.267
say, slit someone's
throat or maybe
even her own,

05:39.333 --> 05:42.068
i hope that doesn't
eat away at your
conscious too much.

05:53.168 --> 05:55.367
Hey. You must be will.

05:55.434 --> 05:56.434
Yeah, that's me.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.600
I'm melinda,
jim's wife.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.233
Right. Jim talks about you
all the time.

06:01.667 --> 06:05.034
Didn't i just see you talking
to yourself on the corner?

06:05.101 --> 06:06.801
No... uh, cell phone.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.168
I was talking
in the cell phone.

06:08.233 --> 06:09.467
That's what i thought.

06:09.534 --> 06:12.367
Hey.

06:12.434 --> 06:15.034
Don't hate me,
but i can't have
lunch today.

06:15.101 --> 06:16.034
What's up?

06:16.101 --> 06:17.101
Something came up.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.267
What?

06:18.333 --> 06:19.367
Girl from green grove
came in the store

06:19.434 --> 06:20.467
and stole
a letter opener.

06:20.534 --> 06:21.634
I called them.
I have to pick it up.

06:21.701 --> 06:22.867
No, i'll go pick it up
for you.

06:22.934 --> 06:24.233
No.
No, no, no.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.701
I don't like you
going to a place
like that alone.

06:25.767 --> 06:27.367
It's not a big deal.

06:27.434 --> 06:30.434
Besides, the girl's being
haunted by her dead twin.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.068
Oh, now i'm really
going.

06:32.134 --> 06:33.267
Come on. I'll drive.
Let's go.

06:36.634 --> 06:38.400
I'll come in with you
if you want.

06:38.467 --> 06:39.934
No, i'm fine.

06:40.001 --> 06:42.300
Be right out.

06:42.367 --> 06:44.101
I've seen worse places.

06:44.168 --> 06:46.500
Looks kinda peaceful,
actually.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.434
They're coming!

06:48.500 --> 06:49.801
They're coming
to get me!

06:49.867 --> 06:53.901
Please!
Please help me!
Help me!

06:59.867 --> 07:01.967
I was afraid you might
file a complaint
with the police.

07:02.034 --> 07:04.600
No, i was just...
worried, actually.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.867
I wonder if
you wouldn't mind.

07:06.934 --> 07:08.934
I'd like to create an
opportunity for natalie

07:09.001 --> 07:11.001
to make amends to you
for what she did.

07:11.068 --> 07:15.001
Call it a sort of
therapeutic
intervention.

07:15.068 --> 07:18.967
I want her to learn
to take responsibility
for her actions.

07:19.034 --> 07:20.534
She's not dangerous.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.667
She just wanted
something to pry open
her window with.

07:24.734 --> 07:28.667
Um... sure.

07:32.701 --> 07:34.701
Natalie?

07:34.767 --> 07:36.867
I'm sure you remember
ms. Gordon.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.200
She runs
the antique store

07:38.267 --> 07:40.701
that you took
the letter opener from.

07:40.767 --> 07:43.801
Is there something you'd
like to say to her?

07:43.867 --> 07:46.634
I'm sorry.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.300
So i see you decided
to grace us

07:50.367 --> 07:52.101
with your presence
after all.

07:58.834 --> 08:00.567
It's ok.

08:00.634 --> 08:01.701
You have good taste.

08:01.767 --> 08:04.367
It's art nouveau.
My favorite.

08:04.434 --> 08:06.400
One of the few things
i won't sell.

08:06.467 --> 08:07.901
I guess if you let on
you can see me,

08:07.967 --> 08:09.567
the good doctor might
lock you up, too.

08:09.634 --> 08:12.333
Doctor: Anything else,
you'd like to say, natalie?

08:12.400 --> 08:16.434
Can i... talk to her
for a minute?

08:16.500 --> 08:17.701
Sure. It's ok.

08:24.168 --> 08:25.567
You see her, don't you?

08:26.934 --> 08:28.168
Yes.

08:28.233 --> 08:29.600
I knew i wasn't crazy.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.767
She's sitting over there
by the bed.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.534
I feel her with me
all the time,

08:39.600 --> 08:41.232
just like when
she was alive.

08:41.299 --> 08:43.366
I feel her energy,
her moods,

08:43.433 --> 08:44.867
just like
they were my own.

08:44.934 --> 08:51.068
Sometimes, i swear, i know
exactly what she's thinking.

08:52.267 --> 08:53.600
She's mad, isn't she?

08:57.068 --> 08:59.434
Because of that night.

09:01.034 --> 09:03.701
My family has a cabin
by lake st. George.

09:03.767 --> 09:05.400
We snuck out there,

09:05.467 --> 09:07.534
me, zoey,
and my boyfriend tom.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.734
Tom is a total
scuzzball, f. y.i.

09:09.801 --> 09:13.734
I got a bad sunburn
and so i went to sleep early.

09:13.801 --> 09:15.534
I guess zoey
got bored without me.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.134
She stayed up drinking,

09:17.200 --> 09:18.634
and then she went swimming.

09:18.701 --> 09:21.267
I tried to swim out
to the buoys,

09:21.333 --> 09:22.434
like when we were kids.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.667
We used to try
and swim out to the buoys.

09:25.734 --> 09:30.300
We were supposed
to tap one of them 3 times.

09:30.367 --> 09:31.667
We could never do it.

09:36.233 --> 09:37.667
Every june,
we'd be determined

09:37.734 --> 09:39.834
that this would be the summer
one of us would make it.

09:39.901 --> 09:43.600
Well, i tried again
that night.

09:43.667 --> 09:48.068
I should have known
it would have been bad luck
to do it without you.

09:48.134 --> 09:49.134
What happened?

09:50.233 --> 09:51.500
I just...

10:00.101 --> 10:03.667
I just... didn't make it.

10:03.734 --> 10:05.600
I knew she was dead.

10:05.667 --> 10:09.134
It was like
i drowned with her.

10:14.667 --> 10:18.068
You know the best thing
here would be if...

10:18.134 --> 10:20.168
zoey crossed over.

10:20.233 --> 10:22.134
You mean, like,
leave forever?

10:22.200 --> 10:23.834
She doesn't
belong here anymore.

10:23.901 --> 10:26.701
She can't leave now.
I need her.

10:26.767 --> 10:28.168
As long as she's in
this nuthouse,

10:28.233 --> 10:30.967
i'm not crossing my legs,
never mind crossing over.

10:31.034 --> 10:33.168
What about
your parents?

10:33.233 --> 10:34.667
They're divorced.

10:34.734 --> 10:38.068
My mother's the one
who put me in here.

10:38.134 --> 10:39.634
I made the mistake
of telling her

10:39.701 --> 10:41.333
that i thought zoey
was still with me.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.500
She thinks i'm psychotic.

10:43.567 --> 10:46.300
Talk about the shoe
on the other foot.

10:46.367 --> 10:48.967
Natalie was always
the golden child,

10:49.034 --> 10:50.300
the one who could
do no wrong.

10:50.367 --> 10:53.267
What was i supposed to do?

10:53.333 --> 10:55.767
Make believe
she's not here?

10:55.834 --> 10:57.634
Lie about what i feel?

10:57.701 --> 11:02.734
No. You shouldn't
have to do that.

11:04.034 --> 11:05.934
Even my boyfriend hasn't
been around in a while.

11:06.001 --> 11:07.534
Oh, please.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.867
My parents think
the sun rises and sets
on that moron.

11:10.934 --> 11:13.767
I need him to tell my parents
that i'm doing better.

11:13.834 --> 11:14.934
They'll listen to him.

11:15.001 --> 11:16.967
They think the sun rises
and sets on him.

11:33.367 --> 11:35.200
I hate that they
put you in here.

11:35.267 --> 11:38.233
I love it.
Don't have to do
a damn thing.

11:38.300 --> 11:39.734
Some cute guys, too.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.034
You're too young
to be in a place like this.

11:43.101 --> 11:44.467
An old folks home?

11:44.534 --> 11:47.034
Why can't you come
an live with us?

11:47.101 --> 11:50.534
Girl with the biggest
heart in the world.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.400
Melinda, sometimes
you have to look at life
as if it's a big clock.

11:54.467 --> 11:57.034
The clock keeps going
no matter what.

11:57.101 --> 11:58.567
What are you saying?

11:58.634 --> 12:02.434
I'm just saying that
this is all temporary.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.400
I know what time
the big clock
says it is.

12:05.467 --> 12:07.400
Oh, i hate it when
you talk like that.

12:07.467 --> 12:09.400
You better not be
going anywhere.

12:09.467 --> 12:13.333
Well, i'm excited
to see what's on
the other side.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.333
Do you have any idea
of how many people
i've helped cross over?

12:17.400 --> 12:19.467
I'm beginning to feel
like a travel agent

12:19.534 --> 12:22.168
who's never
been on a plane.

12:22.233 --> 12:25.333
You're the only person
that understands me.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.200
You're the only person
that doesn't make me feel
like i'm crazy.

12:29.434 --> 12:32.267
You have to promise me
something, sweetheart.

12:32.333 --> 12:35.168
Promise me that
you'll be strong
when i'm gone.

12:35.233 --> 12:37.134
I can't have you
wallowing.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.434
It serves no purpose.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.901
Grandma, you just had
a minor stroke.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.467
You're gonna be fine.

12:41.534 --> 12:42.767
Just promise.

12:42.834 --> 12:46.500
Ok. Promise.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.101
I'll see you girls
next week?

13:10.168 --> 13:12.068
All right.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.168
Tom warren?

13:17.233 --> 13:18.701
Hey.

13:18.767 --> 13:20.001
You're gonna
have to make
an appointment.

13:20.068 --> 13:21.333
The don't let me
do walk-ins.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.634
I'm a friend of
natalie's.

13:23.701 --> 13:25.534
Are you
a social worker?

13:25.600 --> 13:27.467
Something like that.

13:27.534 --> 13:30.200
She's upset because
you haven't been to
visit her lately.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.934
Yeah, well, i started
college in september,

13:33.001 --> 13:34.134
and i'm doing this
coaching thing.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.001
Do you think
she belongs there?

13:36.068 --> 13:38.101
Do you?

13:38.168 --> 13:40.400
I think she feels
cut off from everybody,

13:40.467 --> 13:42.300
especially from you.

13:42.367 --> 13:44.634
Yeah, well, maybe they
can help her there.

13:44.701 --> 13:46.967
Maybe you can
help her.

13:47.034 --> 13:50.534
She needs to feel connected
to her life outside the clinic.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.600
She needs you.

13:57.134 --> 13:59.434
You look
really good, natalie.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.767
Thanks. I'm feeling better.

14:02.834 --> 14:05.034
Well, i'll let
you guys talk.

14:09.101 --> 14:10.734
What is he
doing here?

14:10.801 --> 14:12.867
So, how's college life?

14:12.934 --> 14:14.901
You know.

14:14.967 --> 14:16.500
I've got a pretty
heavy course load,

14:16.567 --> 14:17.634
plus i'm rushing
a few frats,

14:17.701 --> 14:20.001
and i'm doing
the tennis thing, so...

14:20.068 --> 14:22.434
i'm dead, natalie's
stuck in a nuthouse,

14:22.500 --> 14:23.534
and he's
going to keggers,

14:23.600 --> 14:25.068
trying to score with
sorority chicks.

14:25.134 --> 14:26.267
Give him a chance.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.534
How about you?

14:27.600 --> 14:28.600
Um, let's see.

14:28.667 --> 14:32.434
I'm catching up
on my reading...

14:32.500 --> 14:33.600
ha ha ha.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.634
Sandwiched between
about a billion hours

14:35.701 --> 14:36.867
of staring at the wall,

14:36.934 --> 14:38.467
broken up by the occasional
therapy session.

14:38.534 --> 14:39.701
Blah. Blah. Blah.

14:39.767 --> 14:41.134
So why haven't
i seen you lately?

14:41.200 --> 14:43.801
You know,
i've just been
really busy.

14:43.867 --> 14:46.001
Yeah, it's really
time consuming
being a selfish a jerk.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.400
I'm always thinking
about you, though.

14:50.467 --> 14:52.901
Are you? Really?

14:54.233 --> 14:55.967
Why don't you
just break up with her?

14:56.034 --> 14:58.233
You know you're scoring
with your tennis groupies.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.801
Face it, you're just dying
to cut this nut job loose.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.333
Zoey.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.634
Are you sleeping
with other girls?

15:04.701 --> 15:06.934
What?

15:07.001 --> 15:10.068
You know,
i think visiting hours
are almost over.

15:10.134 --> 15:11.534
Are you?

15:11.600 --> 15:12.767
Where did that
come from?

15:12.834 --> 15:14.300
I don't hear a denial?

15:14.367 --> 15:15.734
You know, she's tired.
You can come back
tomorrow.

15:15.801 --> 15:17.567
Didn't you say
that we'd be together
forever, tom?

15:17.634 --> 15:20.168
Didn't you
tell me that college
wouldn't change that?

15:20.233 --> 15:21.467
Nat, come on.

15:21.534 --> 15:22.667
I mean, a lot
has happened
since i said that.

15:22.734 --> 15:24.567
So why did you
even come here?

15:24.634 --> 15:28.001
Yeah, tommy boy? Why?

15:28.068 --> 15:30.034
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

15:30.101 --> 15:31.867
Here's how i'm doing.

15:31.934 --> 15:34.801
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

15:34.867 --> 15:37.001
You don't care about me!
You don't care about me!

15:37.068 --> 15:38.333
You don't care
about anybody!

15:46.033 --> 15:47.434
oh, dear.

15:49.901 --> 15:51.734
When was this taken?

15:51.801 --> 15:54.834
Junior year
field hockey game.

15:54.901 --> 15:56.567
My grandma
never missed an event,

15:56.634 --> 15:59.033
no matter how small
or how far away.

15:59.100 --> 16:01.133
I could always
feel her eyes on me.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.467
I think you still do.

16:02.534 --> 16:04.667
Closest thing
to a twin i've ever had.

16:04.734 --> 16:06.567
Hmm.

16:06.634 --> 16:08.567
You know, this
might sound like

16:08.634 --> 16:11.501
a stupid question,
but do you wanna do
something special

16:11.567 --> 16:13.567
on her birthday?

16:13.634 --> 16:15.634
You know,
like visit her grave
or something?

16:15.701 --> 16:18.400
It's too far away.

16:18.467 --> 16:20.334
You're sweet though.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.567
And you're
sweet and...

16:28.234 --> 16:31.968
Clancy.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.000
It's a dr. Tanaka
from green grove.

16:36.767 --> 16:40.934
We're a little confused
about the purpose
of your visits.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.267
It's not that
we don't appreciate
your interest. We do.

16:43.334 --> 16:44.801
When natalie talks
about you, she seems...

16:44.868 --> 16:47.334
but we don't know you,

16:47.400 --> 16:51.100
and, as of last week,
natalie didn't know you.

16:51.167 --> 16:53.767
Melinda has been
very helpful...

16:53.834 --> 16:54.834
excuse me, doctor.

16:54.901 --> 16:56.968
I totally understand
your concern.

16:57.033 --> 16:59.167
I'd feel
the same way.

16:59.234 --> 17:01.767
I met your daughter
by accident, really.

17:01.834 --> 17:06.200
But we connected
on a level that...

17:06.267 --> 17:08.000
it's just
that we have some
things in common,

17:08.067 --> 17:10.767
and, if you don't
mind me saying,

17:10.834 --> 17:13.334
i don't think
that natalie
belongs here.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.501
And you speak
under what authority?

17:16.567 --> 17:17.567
None.

17:17.634 --> 17:20.601
Just experience,
i guess.

17:20.666 --> 17:23.666
I've had to deal
with a lot of
grieving people,

17:23.733 --> 17:26.467
and sometimes,
all they need is
closure to move on,

17:26.534 --> 17:28.467
and i think
that natalie,
in some way,

17:28.534 --> 17:29.968
is still
very attached
to her sister,

17:30.033 --> 17:31.734
and if she could
get past that...

17:31.801 --> 17:33.501
i'm not sure i understand.

17:33.567 --> 17:37.200
You run an antique shop
in granview,
isn't that right?

17:37.267 --> 17:38.767
Yes.

17:38.834 --> 17:42.334
And you're
an amateur psychiatrist
in your off hours?

17:42.400 --> 17:43.434
Barbara.

17:43.501 --> 17:45.434
Mrs. Harper,
there is no doubt

17:45.501 --> 17:49.200
that natalie has
responded positively
to miss gordon's visits.

17:49.267 --> 17:52.133
Natalie's boyfriend tom
called me last night,

17:52.200 --> 17:54.667
and he described
a very different picture.

17:54.734 --> 17:57.200
He said that natalie
became very agitated

17:57.267 --> 17:59.267
the last time
miss gordon was here.

17:59.334 --> 18:01.367
Well, that's
not quite true.

18:01.434 --> 18:06.033
I'm sorry.
We don't want you
here anymore.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.634
Do we understand
each other?

18:08.767 --> 18:10.400
Of course.

18:13.501 --> 18:14.567
That's it?

18:14.634 --> 18:15.767
You have nothing
else to say?

18:59.234 --> 19:02.033
So you'll find
another way to get to her.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.200
How?

19:03.267 --> 19:04.934
I'm only good at
the encouragement part.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.667
You're the how-to-do-it girl.

19:06.734 --> 19:08.467
Can we talk
about something else?

19:08.534 --> 19:09.534
Anything else?

19:09.601 --> 19:11.033
Thank you.

19:11.100 --> 19:14.834
Um... well, i talked
to will about andrea.

19:14.901 --> 19:16.167
And?

19:16.234 --> 19:19.267
Look, he wants to meet her
before the actual date.

19:19.334 --> 19:21.434
Meet? Does he know
that we're talking about

19:21.501 --> 19:23.601
a dinner date here,
not a pre-nup
negotiation?

19:23.667 --> 19:24.901
The man's gun-shy.

19:24.968 --> 19:26.968
Ugh. This is worse
than junior high school.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.901
Ok, here's
what we're gonna do.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.067
I'll set a dinner date.

19:30.133 --> 19:31.267
You tell will,
i'll tell andrea.

19:31.334 --> 19:32.567
If they don't like
the looks of each other,

19:32.634 --> 19:33.934
they can run in
the opposite direction,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.200
but at least
you and i will have
some nice pasta.

19:35.267 --> 19:37.300
Damn, you're good.

19:38.334 --> 19:40.033
Love ya.

19:42.067 --> 19:43.434
So you're just
giving up on us?

19:43.501 --> 19:44.968
Not even
a little fight?

19:45.067 --> 19:46.634
I can't keep having
conversations with you

19:46.701 --> 19:48.033
in the middle of town.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.934
You do understand
i'm the only one
who can see you?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.601
I'm not gonna
leave you alone
unless you help.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.300
You're the one
who messed up
things with tom, zoey.

19:53.367 --> 19:56.367
He slept with me.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.334
On the night i drowned,

20:03.400 --> 20:05.133
we slept together
while my sister

20:05.200 --> 20:06.334
was sleeping
in the other room.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.634
I felt awful about it,

20:08.701 --> 20:12.133
but i was drunk,
and feeling sorry
for myself.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.501
I don't know
what his excuse was.

20:14.567 --> 20:16.501
Do you think
i want my sister

20:16.567 --> 20:17.567
to be with
a guy like that?

20:17.634 --> 20:19.934
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.801
I don't want her
to hate me.

20:22.868 --> 20:26.400
Look, i know
you think i'm some
kind of pond scum,

20:26.467 --> 20:28.400
but i love
my sister.

20:28.467 --> 20:31.367
I've always
looked out for her
in my own way.

20:31.434 --> 20:34.234
Pond scum, no.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.534
Misguided, yes.

20:36.601 --> 20:38.000
And if you really
care about your sister,

20:52.668 --> 20:53.668
Hey.

20:53.733 --> 20:55.000
Hi.

20:55.067 --> 20:56.800
We're having dinner
saturday night.

20:56.867 --> 20:58.000
Lento's on the square.

20:58.067 --> 21:01.501
You, me, jim,
jim friend's will, 8:00.

21:01.568 --> 21:04.401
He's tall.
Feel free to wear heels.
Any questions?

21:04.467 --> 21:06.000
Uh, no.

21:06.067 --> 21:07.301
Good.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.733
Can i make
a statement?
Brief.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.467
There's someone
waiting to see you.

21:11.534 --> 21:13.167
Uh, sorry.
Hope you don't mind.

21:13.234 --> 21:16.201
Owen at green grove
told me i could
find you here.

21:16.267 --> 21:17.501
Of course not.

21:17.568 --> 21:20.234
You know what? I'm gonna
go shop for some heels.

21:20.301 --> 21:23.100
I will, um,
talk to you later.

21:25.034 --> 21:28.668
I assume you're
not here to talk about
a chippendale dresser?

21:28.733 --> 21:30.833
Uh, no, i suppose not.

21:30.900 --> 21:34.568
Um... listen,
i wanna apologize
for my ex-wife,

21:34.634 --> 21:35.800
the way
she spoke to you.

21:35.867 --> 21:37.401
No need.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.334
I went back to see
natalie after we met.

21:44.401 --> 21:48.800
She was very upset
that you were asked
not to come.

21:48.867 --> 21:51.501
Well, i hope
you told her it wasn't me.

21:51.568 --> 21:53.167
I did. I did.

21:53.234 --> 21:56.800
Yet, she was
really, really down.

21:56.867 --> 22:01.134
Withdrawn,
as they call it.

22:01.201 --> 22:03.067
She told me

22:03.134 --> 22:06.301
that you can see zoey.

22:06.367 --> 22:09.568
That you're
the only who knows that
she's not delusional.

22:09.634 --> 22:11.568
What do you
want me to say?

22:11.634 --> 22:14.434
The truth.

22:17.934 --> 22:20.067
I have seen zoey.

22:20.134 --> 22:22.234
She's what i like to call
an earthbound spirit.

22:22.301 --> 22:24.501
I can communicate with her,

22:24.568 --> 22:27.334
with spirits
who haven't crossed over.

22:27.401 --> 22:30.733
Are you telling me
that natalie...

22:30.800 --> 22:33.700
natalie can't see zoey,
but she can feel her.

22:33.767 --> 22:36.833
She can feel her
just as much as she did
when she was alive.

22:36.900 --> 22:38.733
And natalie knows
that she's here.

22:38.800 --> 22:42.434
Can you see zoey now?

22:42.501 --> 22:46.100
He looks so sad.

22:46.167 --> 22:47.767
It's killing me.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.334
Where?

22:49.401 --> 22:51.000
She's beside you.

22:51.067 --> 22:54.100
Now she's moving over
to the couch.

22:54.167 --> 22:57.501
Just so he knows,
i was in his car.

22:57.568 --> 22:58.900
I left him a message.

22:58.967 --> 23:00.067
All right,
if you're playing
around with me,

23:00.134 --> 23:01.767
this is really
a very cruel joke.

23:01.833 --> 23:04.267
She wants you to know
it was her in your car.

23:04.334 --> 23:06.467
She left you a message.

23:06.534 --> 23:09.568
Oh. Oh.

23:14.301 --> 23:16.267
I wanna tell him something.

23:16.334 --> 23:18.201
She wants
to tell you something.

23:18.267 --> 23:22.201
Tell him i'm sorry
i was such a
disappointment to him.

23:22.267 --> 23:24.733
I really
didn't mean to be.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.867
She's sorry that she was
a disappointment to you.

23:26.934 --> 23:30.067
What?!

23:30.134 --> 23:32.267
How can you
say that, zoey?
Never. Never.

23:32.334 --> 23:34.401
If i could live it again,
i'd be his favorite.

23:34.467 --> 23:37.167
I'd do anything
to get him to smile at me

23:37.234 --> 23:38.334
like he smiled at natalie.

23:38.401 --> 23:40.634
She feels like natalie
was your favorite.

23:40.700 --> 23:43.267
No. No. No. No.
Zoey, please.

23:43.334 --> 23:44.733
I love you.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.534
No different
than natalie.

23:46.601 --> 23:48.668
I thought you were
disappointed in me.

23:48.733 --> 23:50.833
I could
never talk to you.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.800
I mean, you seem
so angry with me.

23:52.867 --> 23:55.900
L... i wanted you
to see me, dad.

23:55.967 --> 23:58.934
Me! Not natalie's twin,

23:59.000 --> 24:00.867
not the girl
who couldn't spell as well

24:00.934 --> 24:03.334
or be nice to company
as well or do anything
as well as she could.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.234
I just wanted you
to know that i was there.

24:05.301 --> 24:09.167
Your daughter who loved you,
and hung on every word.

24:09.234 --> 24:13.167
Just once i wished
that you would've said
natalie looked like me,

24:13.234 --> 24:17.134
instead of me always
looking like natalie.

24:17.201 --> 24:18.234
What is
she saying? Please.

24:18.301 --> 24:20.134
Don't bother.

24:20.201 --> 24:23.900
He can't hear me now any
better than he ever could.

24:30.367 --> 24:32.334
She's gone.

24:38.568 --> 24:40.601
What did she say?

24:40.668 --> 24:44.367
I can't promise
that it'll be verbatim,

24:44.434 --> 24:45.934
but here it is.

24:55.900 --> 24:57.467
I'm so glad
you could come.

24:57.534 --> 24:59.900
Mr. Harper called,
and gave you full
visiting rights.

24:59.967 --> 25:01.467
And mrs. Harper?

25:01.534 --> 25:03.467
He said to call him
on this cell number

25:03.534 --> 25:05.401
if she tries
to interfere.

25:05.467 --> 25:07.833
Go on down.
She's waiting for you.

25:22.467 --> 25:24.934
Your grandma had
a rough night, melinda.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.967
I thought she was
feeling better.

25:27.034 --> 25:28.601
Yesterday she was
out of her wheelchair.

25:28.668 --> 25:31.767
There's good days
and bad. It happens.

25:31.833 --> 25:33.668
She's out like
a light right now.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.867
Well, i told her that
i'd stop by after school,

25:35.934 --> 25:38.334
so i don't want
to disappoint her.

25:38.401 --> 25:41.067
We should really
let her sleep.

25:41.134 --> 25:42.733
I'll let her know
you came by.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.267
Do you mind
if i wait a bit?

25:45.334 --> 25:47.634
Would it matter if i did?

25:47.700 --> 25:49.134
Make yourself comfortable.

25:49.201 --> 25:51.634
Thank you.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.067
There you are.

26:09.134 --> 26:10.401
Hey, they told me
you weren't feeling well.

26:10.467 --> 26:11.501
Just needed a nap.

26:11.568 --> 26:13.267
I was afraid we'd
missed our visit.

26:13.334 --> 26:17.267
Grandma, you see
those people?

26:17.334 --> 26:18.467
Yes.

26:18.534 --> 26:22.934
The one that keeps
looking at me, is he...

26:23.000 --> 26:25.301
a spirit?

26:25.367 --> 26:28.800
No, he probably just
thinks you're cute.

26:28.867 --> 26:33.000
The man
talking to joan is
long dead, though.

26:34.833 --> 26:36.167
No smoking, sir.

26:40.167 --> 26:42.601
I don't feel like
i'll ever be able
to tell the difference.

26:42.668 --> 26:44.100
You will, sweetie.
Trust me.

26:44.167 --> 26:45.167
How?

26:45.234 --> 26:46.733
Well, you'll feel it.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.501
You'll look at someone,
and you'll feel
what they feel.

26:49.568 --> 26:53.167
Confusion, sorrow,
relief, fear.

26:53.234 --> 26:55.534
You might even
feel curiosity.

26:55.601 --> 26:57.467
Maybe sometimes joy.

26:57.534 --> 27:00.367
And it will all happen
in a split second,

27:00.434 --> 27:01.900
and then you'll know.

27:03.967 --> 27:07.733
Grandma, i feel
some of that right now.

27:10.900 --> 27:13.634
No. No.

27:13.700 --> 27:14.967
It's all right, sweetie.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.134
[Crying] grandma,
don't leave me.

27:19.267 --> 27:21.900
Nurse!

27:24.301 --> 27:25.867
No.

27:42.367 --> 27:44.700
I don't know
what came over me
the other day.

27:44.767 --> 27:47.401
Zoey came over you.

27:47.467 --> 27:51.167
I'm writing tom
a note of apology.

27:51.234 --> 27:54.467
Wanna take a look
at it for me?

27:57.100 --> 27:58.867
What do you think
this is gonna accomplish?

27:58.934 --> 28:01.967
I want things
to be ok between us.

28:02.034 --> 28:05.501
I want to know
he's gonna be there
for me when i get out.

28:07.134 --> 28:09.167
You've been talking
to zoey, haven't you?

28:09.234 --> 28:11.201
What did she tell you?

28:11.267 --> 28:13.334
She's worried
about you.

28:13.401 --> 28:15.733
There's something else,
isn't there?

28:15.800 --> 28:18.967
I knew there was something.
She's keeping a secret.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.301
She slept with tom
the night she died.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.967
It's not true.

28:32.034 --> 28:34.501
Tom would never
do that to me.

28:34.568 --> 28:36.401
She's lying.

28:36.467 --> 28:39.668
I think what she needs
is your forgiveness.

28:39.767 --> 28:41.934
Could you
please leave now?

28:56.934 --> 28:59.034
Is everything ok?

28:59.100 --> 29:00.301
Not really.

29:00.367 --> 29:02.301
I think i should
come back another day.

29:02.367 --> 29:03.733
Her mother's getting
a court order

29:03.800 --> 29:05.267
to transfer her to
the state hospital.

29:05.334 --> 29:06.934
Does her father know?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.634
I'm sure it's gonna
be a fight.

29:08.700 --> 29:10.301
I'll tell you
one thing.

29:10.367 --> 29:12.800
That kid'll
never survive that.

29:24.734 --> 29:27.200
you ready?
If not i can...

29:32.501 --> 29:35.100
I kind of wish we didn't
have to go to dinner tonight.

29:35.167 --> 29:37.067
I can cancel
that reservation
right now.

29:37.133 --> 29:38.868
[Chuckles]
After all the work we did

29:38.934 --> 29:40.968
to get andrea
and fire boy together?

29:41.033 --> 29:42.100
No way.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.968
You still worried
about those twins?

29:51.033 --> 29:53.934
You know what?
It's supposed to be
a fun evening.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.601
No shop talk.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.200
See these rings?

29:59.267 --> 30:01.868
They mean you and i
are bound together.

30:01.934 --> 30:05.334
Your problems
are my problems.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.701
So talk to me.

30:10.033 --> 30:12.133
I think i may lose
this one.

30:13.868 --> 30:17.033
[Whispering]
You can only do
what you can do.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.501
Maybe it was meant
to be

30:33.801 --> 30:35.100
mother: Melinda?

30:35.167 --> 30:37.567
I'm not hungry, mom.

30:37.634 --> 30:39.133
You can't stay
in bed forever.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.501
You're breaking
your promise.

30:41.567 --> 30:42.901
Where have you been?

30:42.968 --> 30:44.868
You saw me
at the funeral.

30:44.934 --> 30:46.534
I saw you standing
by the casket,

30:46.601 --> 30:47.634
and then
you were gone.

30:47.701 --> 30:49.934
I was very pleased
with the turnout.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.367
Why are you still
in bed?

30:51.434 --> 30:53.934
I don't feel good.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.834
Sweetie,
i know you're sad.

30:56.901 --> 30:59.300
Your mom's sad, too,
but she's not in bed
all day.

30:59.367 --> 31:02.267
She knows you have
to go on.

31:02.334 --> 31:04.968
Grandma,
it's just different.

31:05.033 --> 31:07.133
I feel so alone now.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.367
Mom doesn't
understand.

31:09.434 --> 31:12.300
I miss you so much.

31:12.367 --> 31:14.701
I'm gonna miss you,
too, sweetie.

31:14.767 --> 31:17.901
You're a very
special girl.
Remember that.

31:17.968 --> 31:19.968
I don't feel special.
I feel weird.

31:20.033 --> 31:22.067
That means you're human.

31:22.133 --> 31:24.567
But you have a gift.
You have to know that.

31:24.634 --> 31:28.300
I don't know
if i want it.

31:28.367 --> 31:29.734
You do.

31:29.801 --> 31:32.067
It may not seem
like it now,
but you do.

31:32.133 --> 31:35.367
You have a chance
to help so many people.

31:35.434 --> 31:39.667
Your heart won't let you
turn that away.

31:39.734 --> 31:41.567
I don't really know
how to use it.

31:41.634 --> 31:43.601
Just take everything
i've given you

31:43.667 --> 31:44.834
and make it your own.

31:44.901 --> 31:47.100
And remember this...

31:47.167 --> 31:50.534
every time you help someone,
you honor me.

32:11.667 --> 32:14.400
Maybe there was, like,
a small brush fire
on the way, and he...

32:14.467 --> 32:15.901
no, no.
There he is.

32:15.968 --> 32:17.400
Guys, i'm sorry
i'm late.

32:17.467 --> 32:20.133
It's fine. We
just got here.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.067
Honestly, i was trying
to figure out what shirt
to wear.

32:22.133 --> 32:25.467
My ex usually made
the final decision.

32:25.534 --> 32:27.033
I have zero
fashion sense.

32:27.100 --> 32:29.167
Well, you made
a great choice.

32:29.234 --> 32:30.968
They are totally
cute together.

32:31.033 --> 32:32.834
I take complete credit
for this match.

32:32.901 --> 32:34.167
Unless it all
blows up, then
it's my fault?

32:34.234 --> 32:36.234
Exactly.
[Chuckles]

32:36.300 --> 32:37.567
You're getting
really good.

32:37.634 --> 32:39.000
And i'm serious,
even i'm afraid

32:39.067 --> 32:40.801
of your backhand
now.

32:40.868 --> 32:43.634
Well... i'll
call you later.

32:43.701 --> 32:45.634
Drive safe.

32:58.367 --> 32:59.734
Natalie,
what the hell?!

32:59.801 --> 33:01.133
Did my sister
ever tell you

33:01.200 --> 33:03.934
she hates
being called "nat"?

33:04.000 --> 33:05.467
Put that down.

33:05.534 --> 33:08.634
How could you
do it, tom?

33:08.701 --> 33:09.868
How could you
have sex with me

33:09.934 --> 33:11.667
with natalie
sleeping in
the other room?!

33:11.734 --> 33:13.434
Stop! You're not zoey!
You can't be!

33:13.501 --> 33:14.634
Out of the car, tom.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.133
Just hold on.
I'm gonna smash something!

33:16.200 --> 33:17.133
Just hold on.
Just hold on.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.300
Get out!
Oh!

33:18.367 --> 33:20.968
Ok. Ok. Ok!
Hold on.

33:21.033 --> 33:23.634
Will you just stop this?
You're freaking me out.
What do you want?

33:26.234 --> 33:28.601
[Revs engine]
Just a little payback.

33:36.567 --> 33:40.767
That was insane,
natalie!

33:40.834 --> 33:43.300
I didn't know
you had it in you.

33:44.934 --> 33:46.467
Where are you going?

33:50.400 --> 33:52.834
Oh, no.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.901
So it was
the third time
in a month

33:56.968 --> 33:58.033
this woman had
a kitchen fire,

33:58.100 --> 33:59.267
and that's when
it occurred
to me.

33:59.334 --> 34:01.901
Either she was
a really horrible
cook,

34:01.968 --> 34:04.467
or she was so hell-bent
on trying to land
a fireman,

34:04.534 --> 34:05.968
she was setting
these fires on purpose.

34:07.601 --> 34:09.900
Yes, we dated
for 2 years.

34:09.967 --> 34:13.167
Oh, my god.
That's just sad.

34:13.234 --> 34:14.501
Waiter:
Uh, dessert, anyone?

34:14.567 --> 34:17.167
I have tiramisu,
chocolate cake,
tortoni...

34:17.234 --> 34:20.199
you know,
i am thinking
one of each.

34:20.266 --> 34:24.501
Ok, i am officially
in love with you now.

34:24.567 --> 34:26.534
My ex never ordered dessert,

34:26.601 --> 34:27.833
but if i did,
she'd end up eating
half of mine.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.167
Oh, i hate
when they do that.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.833
Melinda, yo.
I need your help.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.300
Not now.

34:34.367 --> 34:36.199
And i will take
the chocolate cake.
Chocolate cake.

34:36.266 --> 34:40.000
Yeah, one tiramisu,
2 spoons.

34:40.067 --> 34:41.367
I'm afraid she's gonna
do something crazy.

34:41.434 --> 34:44.467
Your timing sucks.

34:44.534 --> 34:48.033
You know, i have
a work emergency

34:48.100 --> 34:49.667
that needs to be
taken care of.

34:49.734 --> 34:51.367
Do you need me to help?

34:51.434 --> 34:53.167
No. No. Yeah.

34:53.234 --> 34:55.266
That's a great idea.
Do you guys mind?

34:55.333 --> 34:57.267
No.

34:58.567 --> 34:59.767
See ya.

34:59.834 --> 35:01.767
Sorry.

35:01.834 --> 35:03.200
Bye.

35:03.267 --> 35:07.601
Ok. Have you ever heard of
an antique-related emergency?

35:07.667 --> 35:10.767
Um...

35:28.033 --> 35:29.834
I mean, why would she
go to the lake?

35:29.901 --> 35:31.934
She and her sister
used to go there
when they were kids.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.868
It's where zoey drowned.

35:33.934 --> 35:36.601
Wait, you don't think
she's gonna...

35:36.667 --> 35:38.767
who are you calling?

35:38.834 --> 35:41.234
Her father.

35:41.300 --> 35:43.968
Can't he drive
any faster?

36:15.234 --> 36:16.833
where is she?
Melinda: I don't know.

36:16.900 --> 36:19.967
Oh, wait, i think i see her.

36:23.833 --> 36:25.601
I'm going in
after her.
No. Wait.

36:25.668 --> 36:26.601
Wait.
What are you
talking about?

36:26.668 --> 36:27.900
She's gonna drown.
Just don't!

36:27.967 --> 36:29.000
What?

36:29.067 --> 36:31.267
She's doing it.

36:31.334 --> 36:34.301
She's swimming out
to the buoys.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.301
Look, dad,
she's gonna make it.

36:47.767 --> 36:50.234
One of us is finally
gonna make it!

36:54.733 --> 36:56.601
Uhh! Yes!

36:56.668 --> 36:59.668
Tap 3 times.

37:02.234 --> 37:04.534
[Shouting]
I did it, zoey!

37:07.401 --> 37:11.034
I did it
for both of us!

37:20.067 --> 37:21.700
So, do you like
living in town?

37:21.767 --> 37:25.334
Um, it's...
it's fine for now.

37:25.401 --> 37:27.634
Yeah. Me, too.

37:27.700 --> 37:29.467
Uh, this is, uh...
this is me.

37:29.534 --> 37:30.668
Ok.

37:30.733 --> 37:32.301
You want to have some
coffee or something?

37:32.367 --> 37:34.367
[Cell phone rings]
Oh. Sorry.

37:34.434 --> 37:36.167
It's fine.

37:36.234 --> 37:40.134
Uh, it's late.
[Clears throat]

37:40.201 --> 37:41.967
Why would i take
thbasement key with me?

37:43.201 --> 37:44.401
Uh, i don't know.

37:44.467 --> 37:45.733
Check the top drawer
in the kitchen.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.434
I gotta go. Ok? Bye.

37:47.501 --> 37:50.234
Let me guess.
Your ex.

37:50.301 --> 37:52.833
I gotta get
a new cell number.

37:52.900 --> 37:55.267
Well, you're not single.

37:55.334 --> 37:57.800
Yes, i am.

37:57.867 --> 37:59.534
We broke up
3 months ago.

37:59.601 --> 38:01.134
Yeah, but
you mentioned her

38:01.201 --> 38:02.700
at least a half
a dozen times
during dinner,

38:02.767 --> 38:05.201
and then she calls you
on the phone

38:05.267 --> 38:06.367
late on a saturday,

38:06.434 --> 38:08.434
and you don't tell her
you're on a date.

38:09.733 --> 38:12.401
Yeah. I'm sorry.

38:12.467 --> 38:13.867
It's, um...

38:13.934 --> 38:16.900
it's a bit
of a process and...

38:16.967 --> 38:18.900
i understand.
I do.

38:18.967 --> 38:21.134
But it's your
process...

38:21.201 --> 38:23.668
not mine.

38:27.234 --> 38:28.967
When you, uh...
when you put
the "break"

38:29.034 --> 38:30.767
in the break up,

38:30.833 --> 38:33.334
you call me. Ok?

38:40.800 --> 38:43.000
Smooth, will.

38:43.067 --> 38:45.234
Very, very smooth.

38:55.067 --> 38:56.301
Are you all right?

38:56.367 --> 38:58.100
Yeah, dad.

38:58.167 --> 39:00.134
That's she i've been
trying to tell you.

39:00.201 --> 39:01.267
That was
amazing.

39:01.334 --> 39:03.733
Zoey wants you to know
you did great.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.134
Do you see her?
Do you see her?

39:05.201 --> 39:06.900
Yes.

39:06.967 --> 39:08.900
Can... can you hear me,
zoey?

39:08.967 --> 39:10.100
She can hear you.

39:11.833 --> 39:15.501
Zoey, i always
saw you.

39:15.568 --> 39:18.767
I always, always
loved you.

39:18.833 --> 39:20.833
And i guess
i just thought
that somehow,

39:20.900 --> 39:21.967
deep inside...

39:24.900 --> 39:25.867
you knew how i felt.

39:25.934 --> 39:28.234
I didn't know.

39:28.301 --> 39:30.467
I never, never thought
you looked like natalie.

39:30.534 --> 39:36.900
L... i thought you always
looked like you.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.267
Tell him it's ok.

39:41.334 --> 39:43.034
Tell him better late
than never.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.401
She says it's ok.

39:47.467 --> 39:48.700
Better late
than never.

39:53.367 --> 39:55.601
Ask natalie
if she can forgive me

39:55.668 --> 39:57.134
for what i did
with tom.

39:57.201 --> 39:58.800
Ask her if she can
forgive me.

39:58.867 --> 40:00.167
For what?

40:00.234 --> 40:02.767
I'm sorry
for not realizing

40:02.833 --> 40:06.367
how lucky i was
to have you.

40:06.434 --> 40:08.534
My best friend.

40:08.601 --> 40:10.301
You knew
all my secrets.

40:10.367 --> 40:12.833
And you knew
all mine.

40:12.900 --> 40:16.201
I'll never be that close
to anyone ever again.

40:19.100 --> 40:21.668
Tell my dad to get her
out of that place. Ok?

40:23.467 --> 40:26.367
I don't think
i have to.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.568
Is that light out there
for me?

40:40.568 --> 40:42.601
You're the only one
that can see it.

40:52.267 --> 40:53.534
Good-bye.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.134
She's saying
good-bye.

40:58.501 --> 41:01.067
I love you, dad.

41:02.733 --> 41:03.700
Good-bye, zoey.

41:03.767 --> 41:07.634
Just like looking
in the mirror.

41:14.134 --> 41:17.234
Tell natalie to have
a great life.

41:17.301 --> 41:18.534
Work at it.

41:18.601 --> 41:21.267
Be that close
to someone again.

41:24.833 --> 41:27.234
Live it for
both of us now.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.733
Good-bye, zoey.

41:36.167 --> 41:38.000
This is pretty intense.

41:52.401 --> 41:53.634
She's gone.

42:00.367 --> 42:03.167
Thank you.
Thank you.

42:13.934 --> 42:15.634
Hey, what time is it?

42:17.034 --> 42:18.833
A little after midnight.

42:21.234 --> 42:23.668
Happy birthday, grandma.
