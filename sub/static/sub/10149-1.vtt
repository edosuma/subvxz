WEBVTT

01:28.506 --> 01:30.341
Hurry, we haven't got all night.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.051
Cut me some slack.

01:32.134 --> 01:34.053
This used to be Ten's job, remember?

01:34.136 --> 01:36.430
I told you,
never mention her name again!

01:36.514 --> 01:37.514
Never!

01:41.227 --> 01:42.895
I suppose that's my fault too?

01:42.979 --> 01:44.522
Stop it, both of you.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.524
Have you forgotten why we're here?

01:57.034 --> 01:59.704
We've got to finish the job
before we attract any more attention.

02:02.999 --> 02:03.999
Too late.

02:32.903 --> 02:33.903
No!

02:37.616 --> 02:38.616
Let's go.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.813
Jack. We can't leave him.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.611
There's nothing we can do for him now.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.987
- But-
- Come on.

03:31.128 --> 03:34.048
They tossed you
in the discard pile, Jack.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.716
So talk to me.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.426
Lady, if you think I'm gonna fold,

03:37.510 --> 03:39.261
you're not playing with a full deck.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.433
All I'm asking is,
who were you working for?

03:44.517 --> 03:46.352
Who says we were working for anyone?

03:46.435 --> 03:48.270
Your family's taste in art
has always run

03:48.354 --> 03:50.815
toward the Rococo, Louis the XIV.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.401
This sudden interest
in pre-Columbian doesn't fit.

03:53.484 --> 03:55.111
What do I know about art?

03:55.194 --> 03:56.862
You'll have to ask Daddy.

03:56.946 --> 03:58.197
He knows everything.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.533
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to be shown to my room.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.952
I could use a little time to myself.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.454
Sounds kind of chilly
in the house of cards.

04:05.621 --> 04:06.872
<i>You think Gordon's right?</i>

04:06.956 --> 04:09.041
They were definitely
working for someone,

04:09.208 --> 04:11.252
and I have a pretty good idea who.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.359
Thank you, Miss Thorpe.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.156
So?

04:40.239 --> 04:41.407
As promised,

04:41.490 --> 04:43.409
the Jaguar of the Fedazar.

04:43.492 --> 04:44.492
Exquisite.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.580
You're quite the connoisseur,
Mr. Powers.

04:47.663 --> 04:51.041
I developed an eye for it
when Father exiled me to South America.

04:51.375 --> 04:54.086
Our agreement was payment on delivery.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.755
Wait. What's this?

04:57.131 --> 04:59.258
There was a bit of trouble
during the getaway.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.010
I'm not paying for damaged goods.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.179
It was unavoidable.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.680
No deal.

05:04.763 --> 05:07.099
My son's rotting in jail
because of that trinket.

05:07.683 --> 05:09.268
We risked our lives.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.020
You'll pay or...

05:28.704 --> 05:30.372
I don't like threats.

05:30.456 --> 05:33.501
Still, I suppose you should
get something for your trouble.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.714
Take it or leave it.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.063
And you accepted this pittance?

05:54.605 --> 05:55.940
What choice did I have?

05:57.608 --> 06:00.069
This never would have happened
if my father was still king.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.071
Here we go.

06:02.154 --> 06:05.032
Working for a reprobate like Powers
was beneath him.

06:05.115 --> 06:08.160
He had class and made sure
we were treated like royalty.

06:10.955 --> 06:13.332
We've just had a run of bad luck,
that's all.

06:13.415 --> 06:16.293
Is it? Look at us. Ten is gone.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.712
Jack's in jail. And Ace?

06:18.796 --> 06:20.464
We can barely repair him anymore.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.218
Maybe it's time to fold our hand.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.306
No. It's not over.

06:29.390 --> 06:32.393
Give me one good reason
not to walk away.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.144
Because I need you.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.730
And because I have a trump
that can't fail.

06:37.273 --> 06:40.150
One that will put
the Royal Flush Gang back on top.

06:49.577 --> 06:53.163
There's nothing like a rubdown
after a hard day of corporate raiding.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.665
Yes, Mr. Powers.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.084
That will be all, Miss Thorpe.

06:58.711 --> 06:59.920
What?

07:07.678 --> 07:08.678
Argh!

07:15.894 --> 07:19.481
We need to follow up
on our recent transaction, Mr. Powers.

07:19.565 --> 07:22.151
Please, don't hurt me.
I'll give you anything you want.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.945
Indeed you will.

07:40.294 --> 07:42.379
Where's table five's meat loaf?

07:42.463 --> 07:45.466
<i>And in breaking news,
Wayne-Powers CEO</i>

07:45.549 --> 07:48.052
<i>Paxton Powers has reportedly
been abducted.</i>

07:48.135 --> 07:50.763
<i>Officials refuse to comment,
but inside sources</i>

07:50.846 --> 07:54.183
<i>say that the notorious
Royal Flush Gang may be involved.</i>

07:54.600 --> 07:57.519
<i>Long the scourge of Gotham,
the gang has most recently</i>

07:57.603 --> 08:00.648
<i>been involved in a number
of art heists around town.</i>

08:00.731 --> 08:03.651
<i>As of this moment,
there have been no ransom demands.</i>

08:03.734 --> 08:04.902
You okay, Mel?

08:04.985 --> 08:06.046
<i>The police
are intensifying their search for</i>

08:06.070 --> 08:07.655
<i>- the missing CEO.
- I</i> need some air.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.165
Can I get that to go?

08:21.543 --> 08:23.879
Look, I haven't talked
to my parents in months.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.382
I had nothing to do
with that Powers business.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.676
I know, but if you should
hear anything...

08:28.759 --> 08:30.010
I won't.

08:30.094 --> 08:32.346
As far as they're concerned,
I don't exist.

08:33.764 --> 08:34.764
I'm sorry.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.352
Wait. You remember that note I gave you?

08:38.435 --> 08:40.646
The one for Terry McGinnis?

08:40.854 --> 08:43.315
- Did he...
- Yeah, he got it.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.610
I guess I don't exist to him either.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.035
Please, be reasonable.

08:55.119 --> 08:56.870
I'm no good to you dead.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.082
I think 20 million
is more than reasonable

09:00.165 --> 09:02.042
for your continued good health.

09:02.126 --> 09:03.961
I told you, I don't have it.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.422
Stop stalling.

09:06.505 --> 09:09.174
You're the head
of a major multinational corporation.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.926
But my assets
are tied up in investments.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.803
I, I live on company perks.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.888
You're saying you have no money?

09:14.972 --> 09:17.141
What now, my king?

09:21.812 --> 09:23.147
It's almost midnight.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.107
Pafience.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.658
Wayne here.

09:34.742 --> 09:38.328
<i>Mr. Wayne, I'm sure you're aware
of your company's present predicament.</i>

09:38.412 --> 09:39.872
But I'm a fair man.

09:39.955 --> 09:43.459
You can have your president back
for a mere 20 million credit.

09:43.709 --> 09:44.918
No deal.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.713
Perhaps you didn't understand.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.591
<i>If you don't pay,
we'll be forced to dispose of him.</i>

09:50.674 --> 09:52.718
I understand perfectly.

09:52.801 --> 09:56.472
But it's against company policy
to pay terrorists or kidnappers.

09:56.555 --> 09:57.931
<i>Ask Paxton.</i>

09:58.015 --> 09:59.475
<i>He wrote the policy.</i>

10:02.311 --> 10:03.353
Uh, Bruce?

10:03.437 --> 10:04.730
You're not really gonna...

10:04.813 --> 10:07.483
Relax, it's not over.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.067
Brilliant.

10:09.151 --> 10:11.737
Another plan that can't fail.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.280
Father was right about you.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.324
Oh, he had you pegged.

10:15.657 --> 10:16.742
Shut up!

10:16.825 --> 10:18.535
You're nothing but empty bluff.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.204
You think I'm bluffing?

10:20.287 --> 10:22.039
You think I'm bluffing?

10:22.581 --> 10:24.875
No, wait,
I do have some valuables,

10:24.958 --> 10:26.251
gold and jewels.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.837
Ah, the pustule pops.

10:28.921 --> 10:32.007
The Crown of Takal,
it's worth twice what you're asking.

10:34.218 --> 10:35.260
Where is it?

10:35.344 --> 10:37.262
- At home.
- Lovely.

10:37.429 --> 10:40.182
Place must be swarming
with security by now.

10:40.349 --> 10:41.767
How can we get in?

10:41.850 --> 10:43.769
I could send my assistant, Miss Thorpe.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.646
Splendid. What's her number?

10:45.729 --> 10:46.729
No.

10:48.524 --> 10:51.151
I don't trust her
or anyone else close to him.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.862
Then whom do you suggest, my love?

10:58.909 --> 10:59.743
Wayne here.

10:59.827 --> 11:00.953
Good news, old man.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.788
You can still save Powers' skin,

11:02.871 --> 11:05.123
<i>and it won't cost your company
a single credit.</i>

11:31.859 --> 11:32.859
Whoa.

11:38.407 --> 11:39.407
Look familiar?

11:39.449 --> 11:42.327
I always knew
Paxton had this collection.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.413
I just didn't know where he kept it.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.083
There, the Crown of Takal.

11:48.166 --> 11:51.169
It disappeared from a museum
in Mexico City three years ago.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.963
Are you sure
you wanna ransom this creep?

11:53.046 --> 11:54.423
It's my move.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.091
I'm just sweetening the pot.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.596
You have it?
Excellent, Mr. Wayne.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.014
We'll meet you.

12:02.306 --> 12:04.057
Congratulations, Paxton.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.393
Your investments have paid off.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.270
Yeah, right.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.105
You don't seem too happy.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.648
Happy about going to jail?

12:13.191 --> 12:14.526
Wayne hates me.

12:14.610 --> 12:15.962
When he tells the district attorney

12:15.986 --> 12:18.196
about my collection,
I'll be locked up for years.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.365
Unless...

12:22.868 --> 12:23.868
What?

12:27.706 --> 12:29.541
Unless Wayne was dealt out of the game.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.376
Then my secret would be safe.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.046
I'd have access
to millions in company credits,

12:34.129 --> 12:36.882
and I'd be in a position
to show my gratitude.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.717
Are you saying...

12:38.800 --> 12:41.803
Yes. Eliminate Wayne.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.223
Are you in position?

12:47.893 --> 12:48.893
Yeah.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.610
Here they come.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.906
Wait for my signal.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.574
The whites of their eyes, right?

13:47.077 --> 13:48.662
Common hired killers.

13:48.745 --> 13:49.913
I don't like it.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.581
Then leave it to me.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.670
You have the ransom, Mr. Wayne?

14:02.009 --> 14:03.468
Now bring him down.

14:03.552 --> 14:04.845
What's your hurry?

14:04.928 --> 14:06.138
Our business is done.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.098
Not quite.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.818
Move in, now.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.780
Argh!

14:37.169 --> 14:38.169
Ahhh!

14:46.762 --> 14:48.472
Checkmate, Mr. Wayne.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.943
Sorry, Mr. Wayne,
but the money's too good to pass up.

15:05.697 --> 15:06.697
Argh!

15:18.668 --> 15:19.668
Argh!

15:34.726 --> 15:35.644
Get him off!

15:35.727 --> 15:37.896
I can't get a clear shot.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.248
King!

16:41.835 --> 16:43.461
Guess he decided to cut his losses.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.922
He wouldn't. He couldn't.

16:46.214 --> 16:47.215
He did.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.140
Good boy.

16:56.725 --> 16:57.642
What kept you?

16:57.726 --> 16:59.311
They had an Ace in the hole.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.023
Luckily, so did I.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.275
Help. Get me down.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.502
Well, what are you waiting for?

17:06.526 --> 17:07.694
Cut me loose.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.407
You wanna give me a concussion?

17:12.490 --> 17:13.575
Maybe.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.668
Exquisite.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.421
It's everything
that fool said it would be.

17:26.504 --> 17:27.672
I told you.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.007
Darling.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.677
And the rest of his collection
is in the car.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.265
You work quickly, my dear.

17:37.766 --> 17:41.102
It was child's play
after he gave you the security codes.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.730
Yes, everything turned out perfectly.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.941
We've got Paxton's priceless collection,

17:46.024 --> 17:49.611
and he can't report it missing
without compromising himself.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.279
And your queen?

17:51.363 --> 17:52.697
So sad.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.950
I wonder how long
she'll rot in a dungeon

17:55.033 --> 17:58.703
before she realizes
no one's coming to her rescue.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.288
Not long.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.540
Queen.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.880
Now, now, my dear,
I can explain.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.215
Explain what?

18:10.298 --> 18:12.175
That you're a lying philanderer?

18:14.052 --> 18:15.845
That you destroyed our family?

18:20.225 --> 18:22.894
That I've wasted
the best years of my life on you?

18:33.113 --> 18:35.198
Don't you just hate
these family squabbles?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.994
Nothing I ever did
was good enough for Your Royal Highness.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.665
Well, I want out,
and no one's gonna stop me.

18:46.543 --> 18:49.421
You fool. You led him right to us.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.346
Have you flipped your crown?

18:59.931 --> 19:01.641
I couldn't stand it anymore.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.023
The constant comparison.

19:08.106 --> 19:11.067
Do you have any idea what it's like
living in someone's shadow?

19:21.161 --> 19:23.455
Actually, I can relate.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.756
Okay, Jack, you're out of here.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.216
- What?
- Someone made your bail.

19:40.930 --> 19:41.930
Melanie.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.351
I made a lot of salads to pay for this.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.019
You shouldn't have.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.313
Hey, we're family, okay?

19:48.396 --> 19:51.066
I got a job for you. A real job.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.276
That is, if you don't mind
washing dishes.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.569
Are you kidding?

19:54.652 --> 19:57.322
I was the best dishwasher in juvie hall.

19:57.405 --> 19:58.656
Kill Bruce Wayne?

19:58.782 --> 20:00.075
They're lying, I tell you.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.409
Bruce Wayne's my mentor.

20:01.493 --> 20:02.827
He's like a father to me.

20:02.911 --> 20:05.080
Except he doesn't glow in the dark.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.874
Hey, I resent that.
Where's my lawyer? I'II sue.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.185
I'II own this place
when I'm done with you!

20:09.209 --> 20:10.126
Let's get out of here.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.379
You're all gonna work
for the sanitation department!
