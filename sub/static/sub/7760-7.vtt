- I'D LIKE TO SEE THE DEFENDANT

00:42.176 --> 00:43.711
IN MY CHAMBERS PRIVATELY.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.813
- YES, YOUR HONOR.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.149
THIS IS PROVING TO BE
A DIFFICULT CASE.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.550
THE JURY IS HUNG,

00:49.583 --> 00:52.586
AND FOR THE RECORD,
YOUR JUDGE IS ALSO HUNG.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.322
- [moans]

00:54.355 --> 00:56.624
- THERE SEEMS TO BE A BIG HOLE
IN YOUR DEFENSE,

00:56.657 --> 01:00.528
AND I'D PERSONALLY LIKE TO PROBE
INTO IT A LITTLE DEEPER.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.630
IS THAT CLEAR?
- YES, SIR.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.432
- WILL THE DEFENDANT
PLEASE RISE?

01:04.465 --> 01:05.833
- YES, SIR.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.701
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S IT.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.703
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOUR HONOR,

01:09.737 --> 01:12.773
$100,000 BAIL FEELS
UNDULY HARSH.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.209
THE RECORDS CLEARLY SHOW
THAT MR. SCHMIDT

01:15.243 --> 01:18.446
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LAW-ABIDING,
TAX-PAYING CITIZEN

01:18.479 --> 01:20.581
TRYING TO OPERATE
A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.784
- IF YOU CALL AN UNSAVORY,
HOMOSEXUAL PORNOGRAPHIC WEBSITE

01:23.817 --> 01:26.320
A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.722
- [whispers] AS IF THAT TROLL'S
NEVER BEEN TO A PORN SITE.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.459
- YOUR HONOR, MR. SCHMIDT
WAS EXTREMELY DILIGENT

01:31.492 --> 01:33.661
IN KEEPING HIS BUSINESS
STRICTLY UP TO CODE.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.396
HE HAD NO IDEA
THAT HIS EMPLOYEE,

01:35.429 --> 01:38.266
EDWARD STEWART MALONE,
WAS A MINOR.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.601
- WHILE IT IS THIS COURT'S
OBLIGATION

01:40.634 --> 01:41.769
TO UPHOLD MR. SCHMIDT'S RIGHT

01:41.802 --> 01:43.471
TO OPERATE HIS BUSINESS
OF CHOICE,

01:43.504 --> 01:46.340
HOWEVER UNSAVORY, MR. ROLLINS,

01:46.374 --> 01:48.876
THIS COURT WILL NOT TOLERATE
IGNORANCE

01:48.909 --> 01:50.878
WHEN IT COMES TO THE CORRUPTION
OF A MINOR.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.381
IT WILL ENSURE THAT MR. SCHMIDT
IS PUNISHED

01:53.414 --> 01:56.884
TO THE FULL EXTENT
OF THE LAW.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.352
[papers shuffling]

01:58.386 --> 01:59.820
NEXT CASE.

01:59.853 --> 02:05.159
- THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA
VERSUS JOAQUIM.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.428
- I WAS BRILLIANT!

02:07.461 --> 02:08.896
- I KNEW YOU WOULD BE.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.764
THE AUDIENCE WAS SKEPTICAL
AT FIRST,

02:10.798 --> 02:12.633
OF COURSE,
I DON'T BLAME THEM.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.402
- THAT ALL CHANGED ONCE
YOU BEGAN TO PLAY.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.437
- I KICKED ASS
IN THE CADENZA,

02:16.470 --> 02:19.440
THE ANDANTE WAS PERHAPS
A TAD TOO CON MOTO,

02:19.473 --> 02:21.242
BUT BY THE FINAL ALLEGRO--

02:21.275 --> 02:23.411
- THE AUDIENCE WAS TRANSFIXED,
TRANSPORTED.

02:23.444 --> 02:26.280
- THEY EVEN GAVE ME--
- A STANDING OVATION.

02:26.314 --> 02:29.317
- AND THIS HUGE BOUQUET OF--
- WHITE ROSES.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.818
BLACK COFFEE PLEASE.
- COMING UP.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.921
- I WAS THERE.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.856
- YOU WERE THERE?

02:35.889 --> 02:38.459
- I COULDN'T MISS YOUR DEBUT,
SO I BORROWED DAPHNE'S CAR.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.793
- THERE YOU GO.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.929
- YOU DROVE ALL THE WAY
TO HARRISBURG?

02:41.962 --> 02:43.197
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

02:43.231 --> 02:44.432
- I THOUGHT YOU'D BE PISSED.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.933
BESIDES, YOUR AGENT WAS
ALL OVER YOU,

02:45.966 --> 02:47.668
SO I JUST WATCHED.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.403
- WHAT DID YOU SEE?

02:49.437 --> 02:51.672
- YOU, TALKING TO
YOUR WORSHIPFUL ADMIRERS.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.574
- WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE
RESCUED ME.

02:53.607 --> 02:54.742
- HEY, YOU DIDN'T SEEM
TO MIND,

02:54.775 --> 02:56.410
ESPECIALLY THAT CUTE GUY.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.279
- WHAT CUTE GUY?

02:58.312 --> 03:00.948
- THE ONE YOU LEFT WITH.

03:00.981 --> 03:04.685
- OH, HIM?
HE WAS A MUSIC STUDENT.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.620
HE WANTED TO PICK MY BRAINS,
THAT'S ALL.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.689
- THAT'S ALL?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.691
- YEAH, WE TALKED
ABOUT GRAD SCHOOLS.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.360
I DON'T EVEN THINK HE WAS GAY.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.962
- FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING,

03:14.995 --> 03:17.331
IT LOOKED LIKE HE KNEW HOW
TO BLOW MORE THAN A TRUMPET.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.833
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE JEALOUS.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.569
- I'M NOT JEALOUS.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.604
- THEN WHY WOULD YOU EVEN
THINK I WAS INTERESTED?

03:23.637 --> 03:26.707
- WELL, I REMEMBER
ANOTHER YOUNG ADMIRER

03:26.740 --> 03:28.309
WHO CAME UP TO YOU AFTERWARDS,

03:28.342 --> 03:29.710
TO TELL YOU HOW AMAZING
YOU WERE.

03:29.743 --> 03:34.382
- LOOK, FANS ARE GOING
TO WANT TO MEET ME.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.885
WOMEN, GUYS, THEY'RE GOING
TO WANT TO TALK, TO FLIRT.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.787
- THEY'RE GOING
TO THINK I'M SEXY...

03:39.820 --> 03:41.489
- I NOTICED.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.924
- BUT THAT'S JUST PART
OF THE DEAL.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.260
WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN.

03:46.294 --> 03:50.498
NOW, WHATEVER THE BULLSHIT,

03:50.531 --> 03:52.400
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I LOVE,

03:52.433 --> 03:56.304
THE ONLY ONE I PLAY FOR.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.610
- SORRY, BABY, I GOTTA PEE!

04:02.643 --> 04:04.745
[water running]

04:04.778 --> 04:06.280
HMM.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.781
THE DINER CALLED,
I HAVE TO GO IN EARLY

04:07.815 --> 04:09.350
AND TAKE OVER FOR BETTY.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.719
HERE I JUST GOT OFF
THE LATE SHIFT.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.924
JESUS CHRIST.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.793
VIC, IT--IT'S TED,
HE'S ON THE FRONT PAGE.

04:22.696 --> 04:26.900
HOLY SHIT,
THEY'VE ARRESTED HIM.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.936
VIC?

04:28.969 --> 04:29.937
VIC!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.972
YOU GOT WATER IN YOUR EARS?

04:32.005 --> 04:33.407
- [shrieks]
- [gasps]

04:33.441 --> 04:35.042
- WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?

04:35.075 --> 04:39.580
- UM, MORNING, SIS.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.816
I SEE YOU'VE MET RODNEY.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.388
- THIS PORN BUST GOT ME
A LOT OF ATTENTION.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.423
AND A NICE BUMP IN THE POLLS.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.559
- THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU SOME
FODDER FOR YOUR NEXT SPOT.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.727
- TELL ME, BRIAN,
YOU GOT ANY KIDS?

04:53.761 --> 04:56.397
- YEAH, A SON.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.932
- THEN I'M SURE YOU SHARE
EVERY PARENT'S CONCERN

04:58.966 --> 05:01.068
THAT HE MIGHT COME ACROSS
SOME PORN SITE

05:01.101 --> 05:02.936
LIKE THIS SCUMBAG, SCHMIDT,
WAS RUNNING.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.439
- HE'S ONLY TWO.

05:05.473 --> 05:08.809
- THE POINT IS, JIM MADE
A PROMISE TO THE VOTERS

05:08.842 --> 05:11.078
TO MAKE THIS CITY
FAMILY-FRIENDLY.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.946
HE INTENDS TO KEEP IT.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.748
- YOU'LL SOON DISCOVER
THE CHIEF'S A MAN OF HIS WORD.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.350
- I'M FINDING THAT OUT.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.585
- JUST LOOK AT THIS STREET.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.086
BACK ROOMS, BATHHOUSES...

05:19.119 --> 05:20.721
- IT'S A VERITABLE BREEDING
GROUND

05:20.754 --> 05:23.591
FOR EVERY FORM OF SEXUALLY
TRANSMITTED DISEASE.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.093
- BUT WITH YOUR HELP...

05:26.126 --> 05:27.695
WE'RE GOING TO CLEAN IT UP.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.998
- AND IN THE PROCESS
WIN THE ELECTION.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.437
- BY THE WAY,
YOU PLAY RACQUETBALL?

05:36.470 --> 05:38.439
- YEAH, I LOVE RACQUETBALL.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.441
- GOOD.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.709
MEET ME AT THE ATHLETIC CLUB,

05:41.742 --> 05:42.776
TOMORROW NIGHT, ABOUT 8:00.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.613
I'LL WHIP YOUR ASS.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.347
[pats arm]

05:49.049 --> 05:50.418
[car door closes]

05:58.158 --> 06:01.061
- [moans]

06:06.534 --> 06:09.002
- OH, SHIT, SHIT SHIT, SHIT!
- OH, GOD.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.604
- OH, DID YOU COME?
- NO, NO, NO, NO, THANK GOD.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.806
OH, FUCK.
THE CONDOM BROKE.

06:16.176 --> 06:20.180
- LOOK, NO.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.082
NO, DON'T.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.018
KEEP GOING.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.554
- WHAT?

06:26.587 --> 06:28.489
- I SAID, KEEP GOING.
I DON'T CARE.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.923
- BUT, MICHAEL, MICHAEL,
YOU COULD GET--

06:29.957 --> 06:32.960
- I DON'T CARE.
FUCK ME!

06:32.993 --> 06:36.029
- OH, GOD!
[groaning]

06:36.063 --> 06:38.566
- MICHAEL!
OH, MICHAEL. MIKE--

06:38.599 --> 06:41.802
- [echoing]
MICHAEL, MICHAEL?

06:41.835 --> 06:43.637
[chuckles]

06:43.671 --> 06:45.773
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE YOU DID
WHEN YOU WERE 12 YEARS OLD,

06:45.806 --> 06:47.708
DAYDREAMING ABOUT
YOU AND CAPTAIN ASTRO

06:47.741 --> 06:49.977
FLYING OFF TO SOME INCREDIBLE
NEW ADVENTURE...

06:50.010 --> 06:52.212
OR TO FUCK.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.081
SO WHERE'S BEN?
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM FOR DAYS.

06:54.114 --> 06:57.050
- HE'S JUST GOT A HEAVY WORKLOAD
AT SCHOOL, THAT'S ALL.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.986
- MM-HMM.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.955
WELL, IF IT ISN'T CASANOVA.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.591
YOUR UNCLE HAS A BOYFRIEND,

07:03.624 --> 07:05.225
AND WELL HUNG TOO,

07:05.258 --> 07:07.060
AT LEAST FROM
WHERE I WAS SITTING.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.729
- WE'VE ONLY GONE OUT
A FEW TIMES.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.230
- THEY HAD A SLEEPOVER
LAST NIGHT.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.667
- THAT'S GREAT, UNCLE VIC.
- TRY MIRACULOUS.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.936
I THOUGHT I WAS DESTINED
TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE

07:15.969 --> 07:17.671
DATING MY RIGHT HAND.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.573
- SO WHEN DO I GET TO MEET HIM
WITH HIS CLOTHES ON?

07:19.607 --> 07:21.942
- I'VE INVITED HIM FOR DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.144
- WHOO!
- THOUGHT I'D MAKE A TURDUCKEN.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.979
- A WHAT?
- TURDUCKEN.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.681
- YOU TAKE A CHICKEN,

07:27.715 --> 07:28.949
YOU STUFF IT UP A DUCK,

07:28.982 --> 07:30.951
THEN STUFF THAT UP A TURKEY.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.220
- KIND OF LIKE A THREE-WAY,
BUT WITH POULTRY.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.755
YOU AND BEN HAVE TO COME TOO.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.090
- DO WE HAVE TO HAVE
THE ENTIRE FAMILY THERE?

07:37.124 --> 07:39.827
- WELL, WHAT GOOD'S A FAMILY
IF WE CAN'T MAKE YOU SQUIRM?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.695
- [rings bell]
HEY, DEB, YOUR ORDER'S UP.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.597
- WOULD YOU LAY OFF
THAT FUCKIN' BELL?

07:43.631 --> 07:45.232
THIS ISN'T A PRIZE FIGHT.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.701
EXCUSE ME.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.270
[overlapping chatter]

07:50.303 --> 07:51.872
[phone rings]

07:51.905 --> 07:54.107
- THANK GOD
MY MOTHER'LL NEVER SEE THIS.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.576
- DID SHE DIE?

07:55.609 --> 07:57.711
- NO, SHE NEVER READS
THE NEWSPAPER.

07:57.745 --> 08:00.581
[ringing continues]

08:00.614 --> 08:01.915
[keys clatter]

08:01.949 --> 08:03.116
- HELLO?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.986
MAY I ASK WHO'S CALLING?

08:06.019 --> 08:08.021
ONE MOMENT.

08:08.055 --> 08:12.793
IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.728
- HI, MOM.

08:14.762 --> 08:18.866
OH, NOT BAD, AND YOU?

08:18.899 --> 08:21.268
OH, YOU DID?

08:21.301 --> 08:23.804
YEAH, I KNOW, IT'S NOT
A VERY GOOD PICTURE.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.272
NO, LOOK, LOOK.
IT'S JUST

08:25.305 --> 08:26.273
A MISUNDERSTANDING, MOM.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.742
IT'LL ALL WORK OUT.

08:28.776 --> 08:29.810
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.812
I-I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.814
AND DON'T FORGET TO TAKE
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE PILLS.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.783
[phone beeps]

08:35.816 --> 08:37.785
SHE'S GOING TO NEED 'EM.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.820
"GAY PORN KING"?

08:39.853 --> 08:42.155
I HAVE ONE LOUSY LITTLE
WEBSITE...

08:42.189 --> 08:43.624
AND WHO DO THEY SINGLE OUT?

08:43.657 --> 08:45.559
ME. GOD.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.828
AFTER I WAS SO CAREFUL
TO CHECK AND DOUBLE-CHECK

08:47.861 --> 08:50.631
FOR EVERY POSSIBLE
INFRACTION...

08:50.664 --> 08:52.633
EXCEPT FOR ONE.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.835
EDDIE.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.670
THERE HE WAS,
THE WHOLE TIME,

08:56.704 --> 08:59.907
RIGHT BY MY SIDE,
WITH HIS PHONY I.D.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.176
IT'S A PLOT WORTHY OF PUCCINI.
- TEDDY, PLEASE.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.178
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, YOU'LL
NEED YOUR MOTHER'S MEDICATION.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.947
- I KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.315
I'M GOING TO WIND UP

09:08.348 --> 09:10.718
ONE OF THOSE ECCENTRIC CONVICTS
YOU READ ABOUT.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.252
THEY'RE GOING TO OPEN
MY CELL DOOR 40 YEARS FROM NOW

09:12.285 --> 09:13.320
AND ALL THE WALLS ARE GOING
TO BE COVERED

09:13.353 --> 09:14.855
WITH EQUATIONS AND LOGARITHMS...

09:14.888 --> 09:16.924
IN TEENY, TINY SCRAWL.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.592
- WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR BEST

09:18.626 --> 09:20.060
TO MAKE SURE
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.930
BUT IT WON'T BE EASY.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.998
STOCKWELL IS OUT FOR BLOOD.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.667
HE WANTS TO MAKE YOU
AN EXAMPLE

09:26.700 --> 09:29.336
IN HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST PORN,
DRUGS, AND SEX.

09:29.369 --> 09:33.674
- EVERYTHING WE HOLD DEAR.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.709
- THERE MUST BE SOMEONE YOU KNOW
WHO COULD PULL A FEW STRINGS,

09:35.743 --> 09:37.711
YOU KNOW, PUT IN A KIND WORD
ON MY BEHALF.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.747
- THERE'S SOMEONE
WE ALL KNOW.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.015
- BRIAN.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.855
- I'M A DEAD MAN.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.361
- YOU HATE IT.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.396
- I DON'T--
I DON'T HATE IT.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.231
IT'S JUST, WELL,
I DIDN'T PICTURE HIM

09:58.265 --> 10:00.868
LOOKING QUITE SO...

10:00.901 --> 10:01.902
- SO WHAT?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.103
- EVIL.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.638
- WELL, YOU SAID
THE SECRET POTION

10:04.672 --> 10:05.639
HE'S TAKING TO MAKE HIMSELF
INVINCIBLE

10:05.673 --> 10:07.040
HAS WARPED HIS MIND.

10:07.074 --> 10:10.243
- YEAH, BUT UNDERNEATH,
HE'S STILL A HERO,

10:10.277 --> 10:11.979
A GOOD GUY,
AND HE WILL BE AGAIN,

10:12.012 --> 10:16.717
ONCE ZEPHYR BLOWS SOME SENSE
INTO HIS HEAD.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.185
- HEY, GUYS.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.854
- HI.
- HEY, BEN.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.756
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO UP TO?

10:22.790 --> 10:24.291
- WORKING ON THE SECOND ISSUE.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.259
- YEAH, WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP
WITH THIS VILLAIN...

10:26.293 --> 10:27.260
- HE'S NOT A VILLAIN.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.929
A FALLEN HERO.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.799
- HIS NAME IS JUICE PIG.
- OH?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.667
- HE'S SORT OF
A JEKYLL AND HYDE CHARACTER.

10:33.701 --> 10:36.069
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
HE'S CHARMING AND KIND,

10:36.103 --> 10:38.005
AND OTHER TIMES...

10:38.038 --> 10:40.140
- HE'S A MONSTER.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.875
- WONDER WHERE
YOU GOT THAT IDEA.

10:41.909 --> 10:46.046
SO, UH, DEB TELLS ME
THAT ETHAN WAS A BIG HIT.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.414
- YUP, HE GOT RAVE REVIEWS...

10:47.447 --> 10:49.416
AND A BOOKING WITH
THE BUFFALO SYMPHONY.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.819
- THAT IS GREAT.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.757
- I'LL GIVE THESE ANOTHER SHOT.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.926
- THANKS.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.296
- SEE YA.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.165
- SEE YOU, JUSTIN.
- I'LL GET THE DOOR.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.968
BYE.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.770
SO HOW WAS THE GYM?

11:09.803 --> 11:12.773
- OH, DID 315
ON THE BENCH PRESS.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.307
- YOU COULD USE A PROTEIN SHAKE
AFTER THAT.

11:14.341 --> 11:18.045
- I'LL MAKE IT.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.780
- UM, BY THE WAY,

11:19.813 --> 11:23.216
VIC INVITED US
TO DINNER TOMORROW

11:23.250 --> 11:25.052
TO MEET HIS NEW BOYFRIEND.

11:25.085 --> 11:28.055
- ROY AND I ARE WORKING
LEGS TOMORROW NIGHT.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.323
- WELL, COULDN'T YOU WORK
LEGS EARLIER?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.325
- I TEACH EARLIER, MICHAEL.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.262
PLUS I GOT TO MAKE SOME CALLS
FOR PAUL'S MEMORIAL SERVICE.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.497
- I COULD HELP YOU.
- HEY, NO OFFENSE,

11:37.530 --> 11:40.700
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR WORLD.

11:46.974 --> 11:51.078
- NEGATIVE. AGAIN.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.113
- OH, HONEY,
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.382
MOST WOMEN DON'T GET PREGNANT
THEIR FIRST TRY.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.818
- I'M NOT MOST WOMEN.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.387
I'M USED TO HITTING
A GRAND SLAM,

12:00.420 --> 12:01.822
FIRST TIME OUT OF THE BOX.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.523
- YOU MAY HAVE TO ADJUST
YOUR THINKING.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.093
THE DOCTOR TOLD YOU IT USUALLY
TAKES ABOUT TEN MONTHS.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.294
- WHAT DO WE DO UNTIL THEN?

12:07.327 --> 12:09.096
- WE COULD PICK OUT NAMES.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.497
- IN THE JEWISH FAITH,

12:10.530 --> 12:12.399
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO NAME
YOUR FIRST-BORN

12:12.432 --> 12:14.034
AFTER YOUR GRANDFATHER.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.102
- WHAT WAS
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S NAME?

12:15.135 --> 12:19.439
- HYMAN.
- [laughs] OH, NO!

12:19.472 --> 12:21.374
- SHH, YOU'LL WAKE UP GUS.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.542
- WHAT'S THE OTHER ONE?

12:22.575 --> 12:23.844
- HERMAN.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.879
- OH, I'M PRAYING FOR A GIRL.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.327
- [exhales]

12:43.964 --> 12:46.399
LINDS?
- HMM?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.436
- DO YOU SUPPOSE
IT'S OUT THERE?

12:49.469 --> 12:52.005
- WHAT?

12:52.039 --> 12:54.007
- OUR KID.

12:54.041 --> 12:58.778
WAITING FOR US TO WILL IT
INTO EXISTENCE.

13:01.214 --> 13:06.286
- I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT
LIKE THAT.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.956
WHO KNOWS?

13:08.989 --> 13:12.325
MAYBE.

13:16.063 --> 13:19.466
- [whispers]
COME ON, KID.

13:19.499 --> 13:23.570
GET HERE.

13:23.603 --> 13:28.942
[car horn beeps]

13:28.976 --> 13:34.915
- [hums]

13:34.948 --> 13:36.083
- HI.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.117
- WELL, AT LAST.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.952
MY OWN PERSONAL STALKER.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.989
- HEY, THIS IS A--
THIS IS A BEAUTY, BRI.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.924
FIRST CHANCE
I'VE HAD TO SEE IT,

13:43.957 --> 13:46.459
YOU KNOW, BUT THEN AGAIN,
I'VE BEEN BUSY,

13:46.493 --> 13:47.995
WELL, WITH THE NEW HOUSE
AND WORK AND...

13:48.028 --> 13:50.197
BEING ARRESTED
AND GOING TO JAIL.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.065
- YEAH, I SAW THE PAPERS.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.935
THAT'S AN AWFUL PICTURE.
I'D SUE.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.337
- YEAH, WELL MAYBE WHEN
I'M IN THE BIG HOUSE

13:57.370 --> 13:58.939
I'LL STUDY LAW.
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

13:58.972 --> 13:59.973
- OH.

14:00.007 --> 14:03.410
- LISTEN, BRI...

14:03.443 --> 14:05.645
LOOK, YOUR FRIEND STOCKWELL,
HE...

14:05.678 --> 14:07.948
HE WANTS THE POWERS THAT BE
TO THROW THE BOOK AT ME.

14:07.981 --> 14:08.949
YOU THINK MAYBE YOU COULD PUT
IN A WORD?

14:08.982 --> 14:10.350
- WHICH WORD WOULD YOU LIKE?

14:10.383 --> 14:11.618
- "DON'T."

14:11.651 --> 14:14.087
- SORRY, THEODORE,
NO CAN DO.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.089
- PLEASE.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.991
I'M BEGGING YOU.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.993
- LOOK, I DO
HIS TELEVISION SPOTS.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.561
I'M NOT THE FUCKING D.A.
- I KNOW,

14:21.594 --> 14:23.163
BUT YOU'VE GOT HIS EAR.
HE MIGHT LISTEN TO YOU.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.664
- WELL, YOU KNOW AS WELL
AS I DO

14:24.697 --> 14:26.399
THAT WOULD BE OVERSTEPPING
THE BOUNDS.

14:26.433 --> 14:27.500
- SINCE WHEN DID YOU
EVER GIVE A SHIT

14:27.534 --> 14:29.036
ABOUT OVERSTEPPING THE BOUNDS?

14:29.069 --> 14:30.971
YOU WERE ALWAYS THE FIRST
TO CROSS THEM.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.306
- IT'S BUSINESS.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.378
- BUSINESS.
RIGHT. OF COURSE.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.147
I UNDERSTAND.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.050
YOU GO OFF TO YOUR MEETING.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.284
DON'T SPEND ANOTHER SECOND

14:44.317 --> 14:46.019
WORRYING ABOUT
A LITTLE PISHER LIKE ME.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.388
- THERE.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.656
THERE YOU GO.
[engine turns]

14:49.689 --> 14:51.124
DRIVE SAFELY NOW.

14:51.158 --> 14:55.328
MOTHERFUCKER.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.398
- [sniffs]

14:58.431 --> 15:03.470
TRY THIS.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.472
- SMELLS LIKE SOME GUYS
I'VE GONE DOWN ON.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.707
- THAT IS THE GROSSEST,
MOST DISGUSTING THING

15:07.740 --> 15:10.143
I'VE EVER HEARD. EW.
- THANKS.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.212
- I WANT SOMETHING TO GO
WITH A BURGUNDY OR A MERLOT.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.681
- OH, PLANNING A PARTY?
- FOR TWO.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.017
TO CELEBRATE ETHAN'S
TRIUMPHANT RETURN.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.419
- [sighs]
HAIL, CAESAR.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.321
- AND TO SUPPLICATE MYSELF
AT HIS FEET

15:21.354 --> 15:24.024
FOR THINKING
HE WAS FUCKING AROUND ON ME.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.026
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT COMES FROM
LIVING WITH BRIAN.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.361
- OKAY, CORRECTION.
BRIAN DIDN'T FUCK AROUND ON YOU.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.429
YOU KNOW,
HE WAS ALWAYS HONEST,

15:29.462 --> 15:31.331
RIGHT FROM THE START.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.732
[sniffs]

15:32.765 --> 15:35.735
THIS MIGHT BE NICE
WITH A RICH, FULL-BODIED--

15:35.768 --> 15:37.304
- EGGPLANT.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.239
I MEAN, IS THIS NOT
A THING OF BEAUTY?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.041
TOUCH IT.

15:41.074 --> 15:44.044
STROKE IT.
- INSERT IT?

15:44.077 --> 15:45.512
- I CAN'T HELP IT
IF EVERYTHING'S

15:45.545 --> 15:49.216
TAKEN ON A SEXUAL CONNOTATION
EVER SINCE I MET RODNEY.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.750
- I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HIM.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.053
I'M JUST--I'M SORRY
BEN WON'T BE THERE.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.322
- I'M SURE HE HAS
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.723
- LIKE GOING TO THE GYM.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.325
- HE NEEDS TO SPEND MORE TIME
AT THE GYM LIKE

15:58.358 --> 16:01.995
I NEED ASPARAGUS.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.997
- EXCUSE ME?

16:04.031 --> 16:05.498
- FOR THE SALAD--

16:05.532 --> 16:07.734
A MEDLEY OF ARUGULA,
ENDIVE,

16:07.767 --> 16:11.104
GRILLED ASPARAGUS
AND SMOKED--

16:11.138 --> 16:13.240
- LLAMA.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.508
IT'S MADE OUT
OF LLAMA'S MILK.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.145
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.113
I MEAN, THAT
I WAS ACTUALLY JEALOUS.

16:20.147 --> 16:23.016
I GUESS IT JUST PROVES
HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.352
AND I DON'T JUST
MEAN SEX EITHER.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.519
IT'S MORE ROMANTIC.

16:26.553 --> 16:31.224
IT'S LIKE BRAHMS OR MAHLER.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.692
- UH-HUH.
- I KNOW.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.027
I SOUND LIKE A GREAT BIG--

16:34.061 --> 16:36.496
- CHEESEBALL!
- CHEESEBALL.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.765
- HERE, CATCH.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.633
- UNCLE VIC,
DID YOU HEAR ME?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.236
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I CAN PICK OUT PRODUCE

16:43.270 --> 16:45.372
AND LISTEN
AT THE SAME TIME.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.174
"HE'S ANGRY, HE'S CRUEL."

16:47.207 --> 16:49.109
- HE'S NOT THE SAME BEN.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.044
- IT'S 'ROID RAGE, MICHAEL.
- I KNOW.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.145
AND I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.380
I'M JUST TIRED OF FEELING LIKE

16:53.413 --> 16:55.148
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
UNDERSTAND

16:55.182 --> 16:57.150
WHAT HE'S GOING THROUGH
'CAUSE I'M NOT POSITIVE.

16:57.184 --> 17:00.153
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
A BIT RAGEFUL YOURSELF.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.399
- I SAID NO INTERRUPTIONS.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.800
- THERE'S SOMEBODY HERE
TO SEE YOU.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.702
HE SAYS IT'S URGENT.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.705
MRS. TED SCHMIDT?

17:29.749 --> 17:31.684
- YOU MIGHT'VE CALLED FIRST.

17:31.718 --> 17:36.089
- IF I HAD, YOU WOULD'VE BEEN
IN A MEETING, RIGHT?

17:40.627 --> 17:45.098
SO THIS IS THE INNER SANCTUM
OF THE GREAT GOD KINNEY,

17:45.132 --> 17:48.301
WHERE MEN'S FATES
ARE DECIDED.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.636
- WHAT, DID THEODORE
SEND YOU DOWN HERE

17:49.669 --> 17:51.371
TO THROW YOURSELF
ON MY MERCY?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.440
- HE DOESN'T KNOW I'M HERE.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.576
AND I HAVE NO INTENTION OF
THROWING MYSELF ON YOUR MERCY,

17:56.609 --> 17:58.845
OR ANYTHING ELSE
FOR THAT MATTER.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.580
- WHAT A RELIEF!

18:00.613 --> 18:03.516
I CAN COME OUT FROM
BEHIND THE DESK.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.724
- YOU REALIZE, OF COURSE,

18:11.758 --> 18:13.793
THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE
HE'LL GO TO JAIL.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.495
- WELL, TELL HIM TO LOOK
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.731
AT LEAST HE'LL GET FUCKED
REGULARLY.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.868
- I SUPPOSE THAT'S MEANT
TO BE WITTY.

18:21.901 --> 18:25.738
WE ALL KNOW ABOUT YOUR CHARMING
SENSE OF HUMOR.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.507
[door closes]

18:27.540 --> 18:30.210
BUT WE ALSO KNOW
THAT DEEP DOWN

18:30.243 --> 18:31.678
YOU CARE ABOUT US,

18:31.711 --> 18:34.214
EVEN THOUGH
YOU'D NEVER ADMIT IT.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.216
WHICH IS WHY--
- I ALREADY TOLD TED

18:36.249 --> 18:39.419
THERE'S NOTHING--
- I KNOW WHAT YOU TOLD HIM.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.222
I ALSO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
ABOUT TEDDY AND ME,

18:42.255 --> 18:43.556
THAT WE'RE JUST A COUPLE

18:43.590 --> 18:45.425
OF SILLY QUEENS
SETTING UP HOUSE,

18:45.458 --> 18:47.627
THAT IT'LL NEVER WORK.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.230
WELL, THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN I WOULD'VE THOUGHT

18:50.263 --> 18:52.432
EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.901
BUT, MIRACLE OF MIRACLES,

18:54.934 --> 18:56.769
I HAVE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.272
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

18:59.306 --> 19:02.809
BECAUSE HE GIVES ME LOVE

19:02.842 --> 19:04.944
AND RESPECT.

19:04.977 --> 19:09.482
AND NOW IT IS MY TURN
TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING BACK.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.320
NOW I SWORE TO MYSELF THIS
WASN'T GOING TO WIND UP

19:13.353 --> 19:14.954
AN OLD LANA TURNER MOVIE,

19:14.987 --> 19:17.657
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S
THE DIRECTION IT'S HEADED,

19:17.690 --> 19:20.593
SO I'M GOING
TO MAKE LANA PROUD.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.566
PLEASE, BRIAN.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.669
I AM BEGGING YOU.

19:29.702 --> 19:34.574
HELP HIM.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.947
- VIC COOKS, I COOK,

19:40.980 --> 19:42.982
ALL THE GRASSIS ARE COOKS.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.951
NONNY, UH, THAT
WAS OUR GRANDMOTHER,

19:44.984 --> 19:46.953
NONNY MADE CANNOLI THAT WAS,
MWAH,

19:46.986 --> 19:48.688
LIGHTER THAN AIR.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.723
BEFORE SHE DIED,
SHE ASKED ME WHAT I WANTED,

19:50.757 --> 19:52.292
I SAID HER RECIPE.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.626
SHE WOULDN'T GIVE IT TO ME.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.462
SHE TOOK IT WITH HER,
RIGHT TO HER GRAVE.

19:55.495 --> 19:58.298
- WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HAVING
POACHED PEARS,

19:58.331 --> 19:59.699
WITH ALMOND CREAM.

19:59.732 --> 20:00.967
- OOH.
- AHH.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.569
AND HER GNOCCHI,

20:02.602 --> 20:03.970
WELL, IF YOU'VE EVER
TRIED TO MAKE IT,

20:04.003 --> 20:05.438
YOU KNOW IT CAN COME OUT
LIKE BULLETS.

20:05.472 --> 20:08.441
- MA. MA, WOULD YOU
LET RODNEY TALK?

20:08.475 --> 20:10.310
- WHO'S STOPPING HIM?

20:10.343 --> 20:12.379
- YOU SORT OF HAVE TO DIVE IN
AROUND HERE.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.781
- YOU WERE TELLING US
HOW YOU AND VIC MET.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.849
- A POZ MEN'S GROUP.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.252
MM-MM.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.254
- AT A POZ MEN'S GROUP.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.590
- WE SAW EACH OTHER
ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM.

20:23.623 --> 20:24.991
- I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO GO,

20:25.024 --> 20:26.459
BUT SOME FRIENDS OF MINE
CONVINCED ME

20:26.493 --> 20:27.994
THAT I SHOULD MEET
SOME POSITIVE MEN.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.996
- AND WHY'S THAT?

20:30.029 --> 20:31.731
- I'D BEEN DATING NEGATIVE MEN
FOR A WHILE,

20:31.764 --> 20:33.466
AND IT NEVER
SEEMED TO WORK OUT.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.667
NO MATTER HOW HARD WE TRIED,

20:34.701 --> 20:36.035
THEY COULD NEVER
REALLY UNDERSTAND

20:36.068 --> 20:39.005
WHAT IT WAS LIKE
LIVING WITH THIS THING.

20:39.038 --> 20:42.642
AND WITH VIC THERE'S NO NEED
TO EXPLAIN.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.877
WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT
EACH OTHER'S GOING THROUGH.

20:44.911 --> 20:48.848
AND INSTEAD OF SEPARATING US,
IT BROUGHT US CLOSER TOGETHER.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.752
- OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE
WHO'S POSITIVE

20:52.785 --> 20:55.388
FEELS THAT WAY.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.823
- YOU MIND IF I ASK,
ARE YOU--

20:56.856 --> 21:00.393
- NO, HE ISN'T,
BUT HIS BOYFRIEND IS.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.795
- OH, I'M SORRY.
I NEVER MEANT TO SAY THAT--

21:02.829 --> 21:04.497
- IT'S--IT'S OKAY.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.366
I'M--I'M SURE THERE
ARE A LOT OF THINGS

21:06.399 --> 21:09.769
I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.705
BUT IT'S NOT FOR
A LACK OF TRYING.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.644
[techno music]

21:17.677 --> 21:22.715
[both grunting]

21:32.459 --> 21:36.663
- WHOO!
- [chuckles]

21:36.696 --> 21:39.098
[panting]

21:39.131 --> 21:41.668
DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO LET THE BOSS WIN?

21:41.701 --> 21:43.002
- WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

21:43.035 --> 21:45.472
- [laughs]

21:47.874 --> 21:50.677
SOME PEOPLE
MIGHT SAY IT'S SMART.

21:50.710 --> 21:54.881
- YEAH, WELL,
SOME PEOPLE ARE STUPID.

21:54.914 --> 21:59.552
WHY WOULD YOU TRUST ME
IF I LET YOU WIN?

21:59.586 --> 22:02.355
- SCORE ANOTHER POINT.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.623
- BESIDES,
I DON'T LIKE TO LOSE.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.692
- THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

22:05.725 --> 22:09.562
YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT
THE STEAM ROOM?

22:09.596 --> 22:11.764
- LOVE TO.

22:16.903 --> 22:19.606
- I ASKED THE D.A. TO FAST-TRACK
THE SCHMIDT TRIAL,

22:19.639 --> 22:23.476
IN TIME FOR THE ELECTION.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.578
I WAS ALSO THINKING--

22:25.612 --> 22:28.448
WE SHOULD DO A TV SPOT
WITH A BUNCH OF SCHOOL KIDS,

22:28.481 --> 22:30.450
ON THE DANGERS OF PORN.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.385
- YEAH, THE AD'S A GOOD IDEA.

22:32.419 --> 22:35.488
KEEP THE FAMILY-GUY IMAGE
ALIVE.

22:35.522 --> 22:39.592
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH
I COULD DO WITH THIS TRIAL.

22:39.626 --> 22:41.160
- IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.129
- YESTERDAY'S NEWS.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.598
- THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU
TO KEEP IT ALIVE.

22:45.632 --> 22:47.867
- YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE SELLING
LAST YEAR'S MODEL.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.769
EVERYONE'S ALREADY SEEN IT.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.171
BESIDES, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU ARRESTED O.J.

22:52.204 --> 22:55.074
- [chuckles]
- THAT GUY'S A BUG.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.910
HE'S A SCHMUCK.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.480
HE DIDN'T EVEN KILL ANYBODY.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.881
- BUT IF WE COULD
GET A CONVICTION--

23:01.914 --> 23:03.483
- THAT WOULD BE
THE WORST THING.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.051
THEN YOUR OPPONENT
WILL ACCUSE YOU OF GOING AFTER

23:05.084 --> 23:06.886
SOME SMALL-FRY
TO GET THE FREE PUBLICITY,

23:06.919 --> 23:09.556
THE PRESS'LL TURN HIM
INTO A MARTYR.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.823
IT'S LIKE MY DEAR FATHER
USED TO SAY,

23:10.857 --> 23:11.924
IF YOU'RE GOING
TO PICK ON SOMEONE,

23:11.958 --> 23:15.094
PICK ON SOMEONE
YOUR OWN SIZE.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.196
- SO WHERE DO WE GO NEXT?

23:17.229 --> 23:19.499
- WELL, I'D SUGGEST
THE SHOWERS.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.000
- [laughs]

23:23.936 --> 23:26.072
YOU COMING?

23:26.105 --> 23:29.008
- YEAH, IN A MINUTE.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.211
- TO THE NEW YORK PHIL.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.714
- AND THE LONDON PHIL.

23:34.747 --> 23:35.915
AND THE VIENNA PHIL.

23:35.948 --> 23:38.184
AND THE BERLIN PHIL
AND THE--

23:38.217 --> 23:40.186
QUICK, NAME ANOTHER PHIL.

23:40.219 --> 23:41.788
- PHIL FARNSWORTH?

23:41.821 --> 23:43.189
WE WERE IN THE SEVENTH GRADE
TOGETHER.

23:43.222 --> 23:45.558
- TO PHIL FARNSWORTH,
WHEREVER HE MAY BE.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.697
MMM. MMM.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.569
I LOVE YOUR MOUTH.
- AH.

23:56.603 --> 23:59.806
YOU DO?
- MM-HMM.

23:59.839 --> 24:03.009
YEAH, YOU HAVE
THE MOST PERFECT LIPS.

24:03.042 --> 24:06.613
- SWALLOWING.

24:06.646 --> 24:09.081
- OF COURSE, I LOVE
THE REST OF YOU TOO.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.984
BUT WHEN I WAS IN THAT
HOTEL ROOM THE OTHER NIGHT,

24:12.018 --> 24:14.554
ALONE, JERKING OFF--

24:14.587 --> 24:16.889
- YOU WERE TOUCHING YOURSELF?
YOU DIDN'T CALL ME?

24:16.923 --> 24:19.959
- I WAS IMAGINING YOU,

24:19.992 --> 24:23.963
KISSING ME ALL OVER.

24:23.996 --> 24:27.834
SWEET, TENDER KISSES.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.602
[chuckles]

24:29.636 --> 24:31.604
- AND THEN,

24:31.638 --> 24:34.006
I WENT DOWN ON YOUR HOT,
HARD COCK.

24:34.040 --> 24:37.043
AH, LIKE THIS.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.144
[chuckles]

24:38.177 --> 24:39.278
- AHH.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.780
[knock at door]

24:40.813 --> 24:43.983
OH, WHO THE FUCK IS THAT,
THE GIRL SCOUTS?

24:44.016 --> 24:46.919
- I'LL TELL THEM TO FUCK OFF.

24:49.288 --> 24:52.625
- HI, UH, IS ETHAN HERE?

25:04.036 --> 25:05.304
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

25:05.337 --> 25:07.273
- I WANTED TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
SO I--

25:07.306 --> 25:10.643
SO I DROVE IN.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.278
- WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

25:12.311 --> 25:13.680
I THINK YOU BETTER GO NOW.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.748
- NO, WAIT.

25:15.782 --> 25:18.150
HE CAME ALL THE WAY
FROM HARRISBURG.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.152
IT'S A LONG DRIVE.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.654
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

25:21.688 --> 25:25.157
- OH, YEAH?
YOU HIS ROOMMATE OR--

25:25.191 --> 25:28.094
- I'M HIS MUSE.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.248
- WHAT ARE YOU SITTING
IN THE DARK FOR?

25:49.281 --> 25:51.317
- WAITING FOR YOU.

25:51.350 --> 25:54.220
- I TOLD YOU,
I WAS WORKING OUT.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.223
- LEGS, I KNOW.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.793
- OH, SO, UH,

26:00.827 --> 26:04.196
WHAT'S VIC'S
NEW BOYFRIEND LIKE?

26:04.230 --> 26:07.099
- THEY'RE SO ALIKE,
IT'S UNCANNY.

26:07.133 --> 26:10.202
- MM, WHAT SAME INTERESTS,
SAME TEMPERAMENT?

26:10.236 --> 26:13.840
- SAME DISEASE.

26:13.873 --> 26:18.077
THEY'RE BOTH POSITIVE.

26:18.110 --> 26:21.013
- OH.

26:23.382 --> 26:26.819
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

26:26.853 --> 26:30.089
- I FOUND IT,
WRAPPED UP IN THE GARBAGE.

26:30.122 --> 26:31.958
- MICHAEL--MICHAEL,
I'VE USED IT.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.827
JUST P-PUT IT DOWN.

26:34.861 --> 26:37.229
- YOU KNOW, SEEING VIC
AND HIS NEW BOYFRIEND,

26:37.263 --> 26:40.132
THAT REALLY MADE ME THINK,
YOU KNOW?

26:40.166 --> 26:42.368
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD

26:42.401 --> 26:43.736
BE WITH A POZ GUY.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.238
- NO, NO, NO.

26:46.272 --> 26:49.008
I WAS UPSET
WHEN I-I SAID THAT.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.242
I-I DIDN'T MEAN THAT--

26:50.276 --> 26:52.979
- MAYBE THAT POZ GUY
SHOULD BE ME.

26:53.012 --> 26:55.915
- MICHAEL, PLEASE!
- PLEASE WHAT?

26:58.317 --> 27:00.319
ALL IT WOULD TAKE
IS A QUICK JAB IN A VEIN,

27:00.352 --> 27:02.855
AND IT'D BE OVER
IN A FLASH.

27:02.889 --> 27:06.392
I'D HARDLY FEEL A THING,
AND THEN I'D BE JUST LIKE YOU.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.728
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE LIKE ME.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.129
- YOU SAID YOU WANT SOMEONE

27:10.162 --> 27:12.732
WHO KNOWS WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

27:12.765 --> 27:15.167
WHO WAKES UP EVERY MORNING
AND SUDDENLY REMEMBERS,

27:15.201 --> 27:18.738
"HEY, THAT'S RIGHT,
I'VE GOT THIS THING."

27:18.771 --> 27:23.309
WHO THINKS EVERY TIME
HE GETS A COLD OR THE FLU,

27:23.342 --> 27:25.311
"THIS IS IT,
THIS IS THE END."

27:25.344 --> 27:27.046
WHO'S FILLED
WITH RESENTMENT AND ANGER

27:27.079 --> 27:28.815
'CAUSE HE COULD
NEVER HAVE KIDS,

27:28.848 --> 27:30.750
AND WHO HAS
TO SHOOT HIMSELF UP

27:30.783 --> 27:33.219
WITH STEROIDS
BECAUSE HIS LOVER DIED,

27:33.252 --> 27:35.154
AND HE'S SCARED SHITLESS
HE'S NEXT,

27:35.187 --> 27:37.690
AND WHO HAS TO DRIVE AWAY
THE PERSON HE LOVES,

27:37.724 --> 27:40.292
AND WHO LOVES HIM,

27:40.326 --> 27:43.429
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.364
WELL, NOW I WILL.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.899
- NO, PLEASE, PLEASE, DON'T.

27:46.933 --> 27:49.035
FOR GOD'S SAKE, STOP!

27:49.068 --> 27:51.203
- NO, YOU STOP.

27:51.237 --> 27:54.173
STOP USING THIS SHIT.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.042
STOP HURTING YOURSELF.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.844
AND STOP HURTING US.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.713
[drops syringe]

28:04.216 --> 28:07.720
[door closes]

28:07.754 --> 28:08.821
- "I WANT TO BE WITH SOMEONE

28:08.855 --> 28:10.189
"WHO ONLY WANTS
TO BE WITH ME,

28:10.222 --> 28:12.191
SOMEONE I CAN
BE WITH FOREVER."

28:12.224 --> 28:15.194
WHAT A CROCK OF SHIT.
- I MEANT IT.

28:15.227 --> 28:17.063
- YEAH, I'M SURE YOU DID
THE SECOND YOU WERE SAYING IT.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.931
- CHRIST, LOOK WHAT
YOU'RE DOING TO YOUR HANDS.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.266
- OH, SO FUCKING WHAT?

28:20.299 --> 28:23.235
YOU'RE A LIAR!

28:23.269 --> 28:25.104
- I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.873
- THAT IS SO LAUGHABLY,

28:26.906 --> 28:28.507
SO PATHETICALLY LAME,

28:28.540 --> 28:31.077
I AM NOT EVEN GOING
TO COMMENT ON IT!

28:31.110 --> 28:34.080
TRY SOMETHING ELSE.

28:34.113 --> 28:37.483
- I WAS--
I WAS COVERING MY ASS.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.118
- THAT'S BETTER.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.888
GO ON.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.891
- I WAS ALONE,
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.126
- NOW IT'S MY FAULT.
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.828
I MISSED YOU.

28:48.861 --> 28:51.130
- SO YOU--
SINCE YOU COULDN'T BEAR

28:51.163 --> 28:53.232
TO BE WITHOUT ME
FOR ONE FUCKING NIGHT,

28:53.265 --> 28:57.169
YOU DECIDE TO PICK UP
SOME DROOLING ADMIRER?

28:57.203 --> 28:59.271
- BASICALLY, YES.

28:59.305 --> 29:02.274
- SO TELL ME, MR. GOLD,

29:02.308 --> 29:05.111
AS A LAST MINUTE REPLACEMENT,
HOW'D HE DO?

29:05.144 --> 29:07.046
DID HE KNEEL AT YOUR FEET

29:07.079 --> 29:08.514
AND WORSHIP YOUR HUGE TALENT?

29:08.547 --> 29:11.250
DID HE MARVEL AT YOUR
MAGNIFICENT FINGERING?

29:11.283 --> 29:13.920
DID THE WAY YOU STROKE
YOUR BOW LEAVE HIM BREATHLESS?

29:13.953 --> 29:16.255
- IT WAS ONE STUPID MISTAKE!

29:16.288 --> 29:18.524
LOOK HOW MANY TIMES
YOU FORGAVE BRIAN.

29:18.557 --> 29:22.094
- I NEVER FORGAVE BRIAN!

29:24.196 --> 29:27.166
I NEVER HAD TO,

29:27.199 --> 29:30.536
BECAUSE HE NEVER
PROMISED ME ANYTHING.

29:30.569 --> 29:33.505
YOU DID.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.879
- I NEED YOU.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.080
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO WITHOUT YOU.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.015
- OH, I'M SURE YOU'LL SURVIVE.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.952
AFTER ALL, YOU STILL
HAVE YOUR MUSIC.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.921
IT'S THE ONLY THING
YOU EVER REALLY LOVED.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.035
- EVEN IF WORST
COMES TO WORST

30:03.069 --> 30:05.304
AND YOU HAVE TO GO TO JAIL,

30:05.337 --> 30:08.174
IT WON'T BE SO BAD.

30:08.207 --> 30:11.077
- HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

30:11.110 --> 30:15.047
- YOU'LL HAVE TIME TO READ
AND WORK OUT.

30:15.081 --> 30:17.449
IT'LL BE LIKE A SPA VACATION.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.051
- OH, YEAH,
I HEAR THE PRISON GUARDS

30:19.085 --> 30:20.519
DO A GREAT HERBAL BODY WRAP,

30:20.552 --> 30:22.922
AND THE CHEFS PREPARE
A FABULOUS LIGHT CUISINE.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.256
- I'LL COME TO VISIT

30:24.290 --> 30:27.927
AND WE'LL MAKE MAD,
PASSIONATE LOVE.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.629
- I DOUBT THE STATE PEN
ALLOWS GAY CONJUGAL VISITS.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.499
- THEY DID IN THIS FILM I SAW.
- WHICH ONE WAS THAT?

30:33.532 --> 30:35.968
- JEFF STRYKER DOES HARD TIME.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.372
- LOOK, EM,

30:40.406 --> 30:42.074
I APPRECIATE YOU
TRYING TO CHEER ME UP,

30:42.108 --> 30:45.511
BUT LIFE,
AT LEAST AS I KNOW IT,

30:45.544 --> 30:47.079
IS OVER.

30:47.113 --> 30:48.981
[knock at door]

30:49.015 --> 30:51.617
OH, MY GOD, IT'S THE POLICE.
THEY'VE COME TO GET ME.

30:51.650 --> 30:55.988
- NO, HONEY--
- THEY'VE COME TO GET ME.

30:59.258 --> 31:00.492
both: HEY.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.362
- HE'S--
- OH, TEDDY!

31:03.395 --> 31:04.663
HURRY UP, GET DRESSED.
WE'RE LATE.

31:04.696 --> 31:05.965
- FOR WHAT?
WH-WHERE'RE WE GOING?

31:05.998 --> 31:07.299
- THE D.A.'S OFFICE.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.168
THEY'RE WILLING
TO ACCEPT A PLEA BARGAIN.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.636
YOU PLEAD GUILTY
TO THE CHARGES,

31:10.669 --> 31:12.371
AND THEY WON'T SEEK
A PRISON SENTENCE.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.306
- OH, MY GOD!
- [chuckles]

31:14.340 --> 31:16.175
- OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

31:16.208 --> 31:17.576
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL,
TEDDY?

31:17.609 --> 31:19.145
- [stammering]
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.512
HOW DID YOU CONVINCE THEM?
- I DIDN'T.

31:20.546 --> 31:25.417
I GUESS YOU MUST HAVE FRIENDS
IN HIGH PLACES.

31:25.451 --> 31:28.120
- YOU--YOU DON'T SUPPOSE
BRIAN--

31:28.154 --> 31:29.388
NAH, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.157
- OH, I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

31:31.190 --> 31:34.126
YOU KNOW HOW FORCEFUL YOUR
POWERS OF PERSUASION CAN BE.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.328
- UH, DON'T REJOICE YET.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.130
THEY'RE GOING TO SLAP YOU
WITH A MOTHERFUCKER OF A FINE.

31:38.164 --> 31:39.698
YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE
TO SHUT DOWN THE WEBSITE.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.533
- FOREVER?

31:41.567 --> 31:43.535
- YOU DO ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY
CONNECTED TO PORN AGAIN,

31:43.569 --> 31:45.471
EVEN BUYING A FUCKING
NAKED GREETING CARD,

31:45.504 --> 31:48.674
THE D.A. WILL SLAM YOU TO
THE WALL AND SCREW YOU STANDING.

31:48.707 --> 31:51.610
NOW PUT YOUR PANTS ON.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.291
- DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.359
- I WAS ALREADY UP.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.095
I DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.696
- YEAH, ME EITHER.

32:10.729 --> 32:14.033
- SO WHO TOLD YOU TO SLEEP
ON THE SOFA?

32:14.066 --> 32:17.469
- WELL, AFTER
WHAT YOU SAID, I--

32:17.503 --> 32:20.039
- I MEANT IT.

32:20.072 --> 32:23.075
- LOOK, BABY, I'M GOING TO HAVE
A HARD ENOUGH DAY

32:23.109 --> 32:24.576
GOING TO PAUL'S MEMORIAL,

32:24.610 --> 32:28.314
SEEING ALL THOSE GUYS
WITH THEIR SUNKEN CHEEKS.

32:28.347 --> 32:32.084
- AT LEAST THEY'RE STILL ALIVE,
AND SO ARE YOU.

32:47.766 --> 32:51.603
- I'VE DECIDED TO STOP
USING THE STEROIDS.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.373
- GOOD FOR YOU.

32:54.406 --> 32:57.209
- THEY ARE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
TO MY HEALING.

32:57.243 --> 32:59.611
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY THEY'VE
TURNED YOU INTO A RAVING SHIT?

32:59.645 --> 33:02.081
- ALL RIGHT, THEY HAVE TURNED ME
INTO A RAVING SHIT.

33:02.114 --> 33:05.017
[toilet flushes]

33:05.051 --> 33:07.419
I'M SORRY.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.488
- THANKS.

33:09.521 --> 33:13.025
BUT YOU'RE APOLOGIZING
FOR THE WRONG THING.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.494
- WELL, WHAT THEN?

33:15.527 --> 33:16.795
- YOU'RE THE BRAINY PROFESSOR.

33:16.828 --> 33:20.666
YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.268
- OKAY, I'M SORRY FOR SAYING

33:22.301 --> 33:23.502
THAT I SHOULD FIND SOMEONE
WHO'S POSITIVE.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.504
THAT WAS THE DRUGS TALKING.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.439
- NO, IT WAS YOU.

33:27.473 --> 33:28.707
DON'T MAKE EXCUSES.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.110
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
THEN DO IT.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.145
- IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.
I WANT YOU.

33:33.179 --> 33:34.413
- AT 9:00 ON TUESDAY MORNING?

33:34.446 --> 33:35.647
WHAT ABOUT 10:00?

33:35.681 --> 33:37.583
- I WILL FEEL
THE SAME AT 10:00

33:37.616 --> 33:41.053
AND 11:00 AND 12:00.

33:41.087 --> 33:43.289
- YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO STOP?

33:43.322 --> 33:44.823
- I ALREADY HAVE.

33:44.856 --> 33:48.594
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU GET DRESSED

33:48.627 --> 33:52.198
AND COME WITH ME?

33:52.231 --> 33:55.033
- IT'S NOT MY WORLD.
I DON'T BELONG THERE.

33:59.638 --> 34:02.641
- YOU BELONG WITH ME.

34:09.115 --> 34:11.450
- SOMEONE DIDN'T SLEEP AT HOME.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.486
- WHAT ARE YOU, A DETECTIVE?

34:14.520 --> 34:16.622
- [chuckles]
NO, IT'S JUST THE SAME

34:16.655 --> 34:19.158
STUNNING ENSEMBLE
THAT YOU WORE YESTERDAY.

34:19.191 --> 34:20.592
- I SPENT THE NIGHT
AT DAPHNE'S,

34:20.626 --> 34:23.729
IF IT'S ANY OF YOUR
FUCKING BUSINESS.

34:23.762 --> 34:27.866
- DO I DETECT A DISCORDANT NOTE
IN LOVE'S TENDER REFRAIN?

34:27.899 --> 34:30.202
[indistinct chatter]

34:38.877 --> 34:40.879
- HEY, DEB,
CAN I GET SOME COFFEE?

34:40.912 --> 34:44.082
- COMING RIGHT UP, HONEY.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.758
- [clears throat]
I'VE BEEN, UH,

34:52.791 --> 34:54.360
THINKING OF A WAY
TO SAY THIS

34:54.393 --> 34:55.761
WITHOUT SOUNDING MAUDLIN
AND HENCE

34:55.794 --> 34:58.264
INCURRING YOUR WRATH,
SO I DECIDED TO DELETE

34:58.297 --> 34:59.865
ANY REFERENCES TO LOYALTY,
FRIENDSHIP,

34:59.898 --> 35:02.301
RESPONSIBILITY,
AND BEING ONE'S BROTHER'S KEEPER

35:02.334 --> 35:06.872
AND GO WITH A SIMPLE
"THANK YOU."

35:06.905 --> 35:09.475
- WHO SAID I WAS
BUYING YOU LUNCH?

35:09.508 --> 35:12.344
- I'M TALKING
ABOUT SAVING MY LIFE.

35:12.378 --> 35:15.614
- OH. THAT.

35:15.647 --> 35:18.384
THAT WAS NOTHING.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.885
- WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT MEL SAYS I'LL BE WORTH

35:19.918 --> 35:22.254
BY THE TIME
THEY GET DONE WITH ME.

35:22.288 --> 35:26.258
BUT, BETTER "HARD UP"
THAN "HARD TIME."

35:26.292 --> 35:29.495
- HERE YOU GO, TEDDY.
- THANKS, DEB.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.697
WELL, GOOD NEWS.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.265
I WON'T BE GOING TO JAIL.

35:33.299 --> 35:36.168
THANKS TO A FRIEND.

35:36.202 --> 35:38.237
- OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL. OH.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.772
HONEY, I'M SO RELIEVED.
[chuckles]

35:40.806 --> 35:43.475
OH, GOD, THAT'S ON THE HOUSE.

35:46.945 --> 35:48.947
- JUST DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.682
I DIDN'T DO IT FOR YOU.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.451
I DID IT TO PROTECT
MY CLIENT.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.920
[pats back]

35:54.953 --> 35:57.289
- OF COURSE.

35:57.323 --> 36:00.292
HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN
SO PRESUMPTUOUS?

36:03.362 --> 36:05.564
[deep breath]

36:09.301 --> 36:11.570
- I'LL NEVER FIGURE OUT
WHY HE DOES THAT.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.872
- YOU MEAN ACT
LIKE A TOTAL SHIT?

36:13.905 --> 36:17.576
- WHEN IT'S OBVIOUS
HE JUST SAVED TEDDY'S ASS.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.478
[bell rings]

36:19.511 --> 36:21.713
- ONE SPECIAL,
ONE PINK PLATE.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.617
- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TEST
EVERY TIME YOU TINKLE.

36:25.651 --> 36:26.985
- SAYS WHO?

36:27.018 --> 36:28.954
- YOU HAVE TO LET MOTHER NATURE
TAKE HER COURSE

36:28.987 --> 36:30.822
IN HER OWN SWEET TIME.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.491
OH.
[laughs]

36:32.524 --> 36:35.994
- IT'S EASY FOR HER,
SHE'S ALREADY A MOTHER.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.596
- ALL RIGHT.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.631
I'LL LET YOU HAVE YOUR FUN
WITH CHEMISTRY

36:39.665 --> 36:43.369
AND GO MAKE DINNER.
SLOPPY JOES OKAY?

36:43.402 --> 36:46.238
MEL?

36:46.272 --> 36:48.574
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT PUTTING
THE BUNS IN THE OVEN.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.609
- WHAT?

36:55.647 --> 36:57.949
- OH, MY GOD.

37:01.287 --> 37:03.989
IT'S--
[gulps]

37:04.022 --> 37:05.524
IT'S BLUE.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.593
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT,
IT'S BLUE.

37:07.626 --> 37:11.463
- WELL, THIS MEANS YOU'RE--
- YOU GOT IT.

37:11.497 --> 37:12.798
- ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS ACCURATE?

37:12.831 --> 37:14.500
- OH, IT BETTER BE,
OR ELSE

37:14.533 --> 37:16.001
I'M GOING TO SUE THE PANTIES
OFF THAT COMPANY.

37:16.034 --> 37:18.537
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.038
FIRST TIME OUT OF THE BOX.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.540
- TOLD YOU.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.276
DON'T FUCK WITH MOTHER NATURE,
HUH?

37:24.310 --> 37:25.611
WELL, I'M HERE TO TELL HER,

37:25.644 --> 37:27.946
"DON'T FUCK WITH ME."

37:27.979 --> 37:30.916
[chuckles]

38:03.549 --> 38:05.584
- WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO
WITH ALL THESE?

38:05.617 --> 38:06.985
- HMM?

38:07.018 --> 38:10.389
OH, UH, I THOUGHT I'D DONATE
THEM TO CHARITY.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.057
- HMM.

38:12.090 --> 38:14.393
YOU CAN GET A WRITE-OFF.

38:14.426 --> 38:17.363
- YEAH, SOMEHOW, I DON'T THINK
I'LL BE NEEDING THAT NOW.

38:19.465 --> 38:22.067
- OH, MY GOD!

38:22.100 --> 38:24.336
LOOK!

38:24.370 --> 38:27.806
IT'S MY REVOLVING BED,
FROM WHEN I WAS A BIG STAR.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.741
- MM, YOU STILL ARE.

38:29.775 --> 38:32.811
IT'S THE DICKS THAT GOT SMALL.
- [chuckles]

38:32.844 --> 38:34.980
- I NEVER LET
ANYONE ELSE USE IT.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.849
IT RETIRED WHEN YOU DID.

38:37.883 --> 38:40.886
- GOD, IT BRINGS BACK
SO MANY MEMORIES.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.988
THE G.I. JOE JERK,

38:43.021 --> 38:44.823
THE CONSTRUCTION WORKER WHACK.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.758
- GOD BLESS
THE VILLAGE PEOPLE.

38:46.792 --> 38:50.095
TRUE VISIONARIES.

38:50.128 --> 38:54.032
- SO YOU, UH, CARE TO TAKE HER
FOR A LITTLE SPIN?

38:56.502 --> 38:59.137
- UH, NO, I CAN'T.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.706
I GOT TOO MUCH TO DO.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.474
- OH, PLEASE, TEDDY?

39:02.508 --> 39:04.510
COME ON, ONE LAST TIME?

39:04.543 --> 39:06.111
- [sighs]

39:06.144 --> 39:09.448
- ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
START 'ER UP!

39:09.481 --> 39:10.782
HERE WE GO.

39:10.816 --> 39:13.752
- [chuckles]

39:16.021 --> 39:19.525
- REMEMBER, YOU GAVE ME
MY PORN NAME, HUH?

39:19.558 --> 39:21.126
- "FETCH DIXON"--

39:21.159 --> 39:24.095
NAME OF YOUR FAVORITE PET
AND THE STREET YOU GREW UP ON.

39:26.632 --> 39:29.568
- YOU KNOW,
YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOURS.

39:32.638 --> 39:35.774
- [sighs]

39:35.807 --> 39:38.810
"MILLICENT KENSINGTON."

39:38.844 --> 39:41.780
[both laugh]

39:48.920 --> 39:51.690
- OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.625
- [crying]
- YOU CRY.

39:53.659 --> 39:56.662
YOU CRY ALL YOU WANT.

39:58.196 --> 40:00.766
- YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M MOST UPSET ABOUT?

40:00.799 --> 40:03.769
- NO MORE "RIM-A-RAMA"?

40:03.802 --> 40:06.638
- THAT WE HAD TO GIVE UP
THE HOUSE.

40:06.672 --> 40:09.975
I REALLY WANTED YOU
TO HAVE THAT.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.176
- HONEY, YOUR SAYING THAT

40:11.209 --> 40:13.779
MEANS MORE TO ME
THAN LIVING IN IT.

40:13.812 --> 40:16.915
- [sniffles]
YEAH, NOT QUITE.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.950
- LISTEN.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.786
WHERE I COME FROM,

40:20.819 --> 40:23.589
WE HAD TORNADOES
ALL THE TIME.

40:23.622 --> 40:28.560
THEY'D BLOW THE ROOF OFF,
DESTROY EVERYTHING.

40:28.594 --> 40:33.198
WE ALWAYS LOOKED AT IT
AS A CHANCE TO REBUILD,

40:33.231 --> 40:36.067
YOU KNOW, MAKE THINGS BETTER.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.069
SO THE BUSINESS IS GONE.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.205
SO THE HOUSE IS GONE.

40:40.238 --> 40:41.873
SO EVERY CENT
YOU EVER MADE--

40:41.907 --> 40:44.743
- YEAH, YEAH, I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

40:44.776 --> 40:48.714
- THE POINT IS,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.818
WE STILL HAVE EACH OTHER.

40:52.851 --> 40:57.523
AND TOGETHER,
WE ARE GOING TO BE JUST FINE.

*

41:15.741 --> 41:19.645
[indistinct chatter]

41:39.064 --> 41:41.867
- THAT'S A MONTECRISTO ESPECIAL
SMUGGLED FROM CUBA,

41:41.900 --> 41:44.903
SO STICK IT IN YOUR MOUTH
AND SUCK.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.271
[chuckles]

41:46.304 --> 41:47.939
IF THAT'S ANY INDICATION
OF YOUR TECHNIQUE,

41:47.973 --> 41:49.608
IT'S AMAZING
YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

41:49.641 --> 41:51.643
- I'M STILL IN SHOCK.

41:51.677 --> 41:54.546
WE MADE A BABY
AFTER JUST ONE TRY.

41:54.580 --> 41:56.181
- IT'S FUCKING DEPRESSING,
ALL RIGHT,

41:56.214 --> 41:59.885
THAT YOUR SPERM ACTUALLY
LIKED MELANIE'S EGGS. UGH.

41:59.918 --> 42:00.919
WELL, I GUESS THERE'S
NO ACCOUNTING

42:00.952 --> 42:02.721
FOR SOME PEOPLE'S TASTES.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.590
- [clears throat]

42:06.324 --> 42:09.928
- EASY, MIKEY.

42:09.961 --> 42:12.798
- I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT.
- WHAT?

42:12.831 --> 42:14.332
- BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR ANOTHER LIFE.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.934
- WELL, DID I ASK YOU TO?

42:15.967 --> 42:17.168
- NOT YOU, ASSHOLE. THE KID.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.804
- YOUR JOB'S DONE.

42:18.837 --> 42:20.305
FROM HERE ON OUT,
THE LEZZIES DO ALL THE WORK.

42:20.338 --> 42:22.107
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SHOW UP
FOR BIRTHDAY PARTIES

42:22.140 --> 42:24.309
AND THE OCCASIONAL
WALK IN THE PARK.

42:24.342 --> 42:27.312
- I DON'T INTEND TO BE
A DROP-IN DAD LIKE YOU.

42:27.345 --> 42:29.781
