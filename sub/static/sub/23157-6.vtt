WEBVTT

00:00.261 --> 00:03.134
Nazis are after my Saul.

00:03.513 --> 00:04.429
Nazis?

00:06.236 --> 00:07.236
Wuh-oh.

00:07.321 --> 00:09.188
Shouldn't have lowered your head, boy.

00:09.563 --> 00:13.860
Why is it when I find out what people hire
me to find out, they take it out on me?

00:14.022 --> 00:17.373
Saul was a member of something
called the Masada Team.

00:17.653 --> 00:21.446
It's a secret Israeli unit
that locates and captures war criminals.

00:21.489 --> 00:24.160
They got Eichmann
and only they know how many others.

00:27.369 --> 00:29.871
Thomas, I don't know if I'm ready for Nazis.

00:29.914 --> 00:32.278
Just give me five minutes
then you make the delivery.

00:33.490 --> 00:37.178
AhÃ­ Sushi Delivery.
Your wish for fish come true.

00:40.547 --> 00:42.882
Don't leave the room under
any circumstances.

00:46.013 --> 00:46.754
Halt!

00:47.473 --> 00:49.396
I've gotta get Higgins to the hospital.

02:15.353 --> 02:17.439
'Hello?'
Hello?

02:17.480 --> 02:20.608
'Kessler?'
I was right. It is him.

02:20.650 --> 02:24.529
'Are you positive?'
Yes. I think he might be on to me.

02:24.571 --> 02:27.490
'Did he recognise you?'
I don't know.

02:27.532 --> 02:31.369
I don't wanna take any chances.
We should get him as soon as possible.

02:31.411 --> 02:34.748
'We'll be there in 24 hours.'
I'll pick you up.

03:02.233 --> 03:06.279
You wanna go to the boat first?
No. First show us where he is.

03:06.321 --> 03:09.991
He and his wife own a shirt shop
close to Waikiki.

03:10.033 --> 03:13.328
How about his wife?
Yes, she's still alive.

03:13.370 --> 03:17.957
We may not have time for them both.
That's OK. He's our priority.

03:34.891 --> 03:36.977
We're coming up to the shop.

03:38.019 --> 03:40.939
It's busy.
I don't think we can take him here.

03:40.981 --> 03:43.358
Don't linger too long. He might see us.

03:44.150 --> 03:47.028
OK, I'll take you to the boat now.

03:49.489 --> 03:53.201
With those fancy shirts,
that outrigger crew of yours had better win.

03:53.243 --> 03:56.955
Winning ain't important, pop,
long as we look good at the luau later.

03:56.997 --> 03:59.082
Typical Hawaiian philosophy.

03:59.124 --> 04:01.668
To win is important too, you know?

04:01.710 --> 04:04.963
You and Mrs Greenberg
better be there Saturday to cheer us on.

04:05.005 --> 04:07.090
Mama and I will be there. You just win.

04:07.132 --> 04:09.217
OK, pops.

04:34.951 --> 04:38.413
- What did you see?
- I don't have to see.

04:38.455 --> 04:40.540
I feel.

04:42.500 --> 04:46.588
- Here. It may be nothing.
- Nothing?

04:47.380 --> 04:49.674
You're not sure.

04:49.716 --> 04:52.844
I'm sure, Lena. I know.

04:52.886 --> 04:54.804
I feel them.

05:00.143 --> 05:03.480
- Oh, Saul.
- We close the shop today.

05:14.074 --> 05:16.743
I don't know how he keeps
pullin' that mess off.

05:16.785 --> 05:18.870
- Yeah, well, neither does he.
- Hm?

05:18.912 --> 05:21.039
It's all in the subconscious, TC.

05:21.081 --> 05:24.042
- Haven't you heard of body language?
- Body language?

05:24.084 --> 05:28.630
The body can tell you all kinds
of stuff without you even knowing.

05:29.506 --> 05:33.802
You don't believe me, huh?
You see the way he's lowerin' his head?

05:33.843 --> 05:37.514
The body's saying he's vulnerable,
and the ladies love it.

05:37.555 --> 05:41.184
Watch. Any second now,
she'll throw her arms around his neck

05:41.226 --> 05:43.687
and bury her head right in his chest.

05:45.772 --> 05:50.944
Huh! Well, for a guy that don't know
what he's doin', he sure do it good.

05:53.279 --> 05:55.907
Wuh-oh.

05:56.533 --> 05:59.119
Hey, she got a little body language
of her own.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.454
Yeah, well, that's obvious.

06:09.337 --> 06:13.091
- Thanks for the coffee, Rick.
- OK. Take care, TC.

06:17.971 --> 06:20.140
Shouldn't have lowered your head, boy.

06:22.100 --> 06:24.894
Shouldn't have lowered my head?

06:25.979 --> 06:30.442
Why is it when I find out what people hire
me to find out, they take it out on me?

06:30.483 --> 06:33.403
I don't know but, here, put some ice on it.

06:34.654 --> 06:36.781
That's very funny.

06:36.823 --> 06:38.908
Hey, Saul.

06:38.950 --> 06:44.914
Another hard day at the office, eh, boys?
What are you two doing in here?

06:44.956 --> 06:49.169
- All the pretty ladies are out by the pool.
- Well, it's safer in here.

06:49.210 --> 06:51.588
Are these the waiters' jackets I ordered?

06:51.629 --> 06:55.842
Yes. With those coats, your waiters
will look better than your members.

06:55.884 --> 06:59.638
- You look warm. Mac, get him a drink.
- Er, two cents plain.

06:59.679 --> 07:02.057
That's seltzer.

07:02.098 --> 07:05.060
You got Lena workin' double time
on the sewing machine?

07:05.101 --> 07:09.356
- These weren't due till Tuesday.
- She has an incentive to finish early.

07:09.397 --> 07:13.276
Mama and me are going
on a vacation tomorrow.

07:14.277 --> 07:16.237
A vacation? I don't believe it.

07:16.279 --> 07:19.032
Mm. Believe it.

07:20.116 --> 07:24.037
For years she's been harping me
I should take her somewhere.

07:24.079 --> 07:26.164
Finally, she said,

07:26.206 --> 07:29.959
"You don't take me on vacation,
I find myself a younger man."

07:33.046 --> 07:35.006
Yeah, big deal.

07:35.048 --> 07:37.592
At our age, an old man is a younger man.

07:37.634 --> 07:42.263
So, a vacation - what'll it hurt?
So, we're going.

07:42.305 --> 07:45.016
It sounds like she's really got you worried.

07:45.725 --> 07:48.311
Worried? What, me? Never.

07:49.396 --> 07:55.110
Of course, she's been acting very nice
to old man Bernstein lately.

07:56.653 --> 07:59.155
Where are you gonna go
on this vacation?

07:59.197 --> 08:01.950
New York City. Relatives, you know.

08:01.992 --> 08:04.369
Yeah. Well, you have a good time, anyway.

08:04.411 --> 08:07.664
- Yes. Is that my cheque?
- That is your cheque.

08:07.706 --> 08:09.791
- Good.
- Thanks, Saul.

08:13.128 --> 08:15.380
- Shalom.
- Have a good time.

08:18.466 --> 08:22.345
- I wonder how long he's been planning that.
- I don't know. You heard him.

08:22.387 --> 08:25.307
Lena's been planning,
he's been postponing.

08:25.348 --> 08:30.145
Hey, my new tux is in here. He didn't even
mention it. It's not on the bill either.

08:30.186 --> 08:33.315
She must've really been anxious
to get on that vacation.

08:33.356 --> 08:37.277
I'm goin' that way. Come with me,
pay him and we'll say goodbye to Lena.

08:37.318 --> 08:39.571
OK, that's a good idea.

08:40.613 --> 08:43.825
- Here. This'll keep you honest.
- Mac.

08:47.537 --> 08:51.082
Will they keep the shop open
while they're on vacation?

08:51.124 --> 08:54.878
They might have someone
part time to take orders.

09:06.598 --> 09:08.808
Out of business?

09:17.442 --> 09:21.613
Hey, brahda. Bet you'd like a ride
to Diamond Head. Ten bucks round trip.

09:21.655 --> 09:24.324
Ten bucks? No, thanks. I got a car.

09:24.366 --> 09:27.035
Them wheels are yours? Come on.

09:27.077 --> 09:29.663
What do you mean, come on?
What's your name?

09:29.704 --> 09:32.791
Miko's the name, pedalling's the game.
How can I help?

09:32.832 --> 09:37.462
- You know the Greenbergs?
- Yeah. Just yesterday, they takin' tourists...

09:37.504 --> 09:41.132
I mean, doin' business. You know
what I mean? And today, pau'ana.

09:41.174 --> 09:44.886
- They say anything about taking a vacation?
- Saul take a vacation?

09:44.928 --> 09:47.597
- You gotta be kidding.
- I know what you mean.

09:47.639 --> 09:52.060
Tom? This guy says that Saul and Lena
closed the place early last night.

09:52.102 --> 09:54.187
This morning, the place was for sale.

09:54.229 --> 09:56.606
There was no answer
from them this morning.

09:56.648 --> 10:00.151
- Does this kid know anything?
- He's as surprised as we are.

10:00.193 --> 10:03.363
- Let's run by their house.
- You find anything, let me know.

10:03.405 --> 10:05.657
- I like them old haoles.
- Mahalo, brah.

10:05.699 --> 10:07.951
Thanks, brah.

10:24.092 --> 10:26.886
Saul said
they were taking a vacation.

10:26.928 --> 10:29.347
We're meddling.
We're not.

10:29.431 --> 10:32.183
- We are so. We're meddling.
- We're not meddling!

10:32.225 --> 10:34.311
Oh.

10:35.228 --> 10:38.398
Wait. Is that an ambulance
outside the Greenberg's house?

10:38.440 --> 10:42.152
Well, it's not an ice-cream truck.

10:46.865 --> 10:48.950
- Saul!
- Stay back, sir.

10:48.992 --> 10:51.244
- What happened?
- Is it his heart?

10:51.286 --> 10:54.914
Looks like it. We'll know better
at the hospital. Stand back.

10:54.956 --> 10:57.625
- Er, where's his wife?
- I don't know.

11:00.462 --> 11:03.715
- What hospital are you goin' to?
- Honolulu General.

11:11.681 --> 11:13.767
Lena?

11:15.644 --> 11:17.729
Lena?

11:26.446 --> 11:28.698
She's not here.

11:31.284 --> 11:33.703
- Where'd they take him?
- Honolulu General.

11:33.745 --> 11:36.665
- That's what his prescription says.
- That's not far.

11:36.706 --> 11:39.376
- Wait. What about Lena?
- We'll leave her a note.

11:39.417 --> 11:42.921
No! What would I say?
"Dear Lena, Saul's had a heart attack"?

11:42.963 --> 11:47.717
- Stay here and break it to her gently.
- Wait a minute! Wait! Hold it!

11:47.759 --> 11:50.845
Wait a second!
How do I break it to her gently?

11:50.887 --> 11:53.723
I don't know.
You're good at that sort of thing.

11:53.765 --> 11:56.101
I'm not that good at it.

11:58.645 --> 12:01.606
Now, wait a minute! Thomas! Thomas!

12:08.863 --> 12:11.449
Break it to her gently. Break it to her gently.

12:11.491 --> 12:13.910
He did it to me again.

12:15.829 --> 12:18.915
Hi, Lena. Saul's got this little problem.

12:18.957 --> 12:21.793
His heart attacked him. No, that's terrible.

12:26.506 --> 12:30.218
'Janet Clark,
please report to maternity.'

12:30.260 --> 12:31.803
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

12:31.845 --> 12:34.472
Could you tell me the status
of a Saul Greenberg?

12:34.514 --> 12:38.143
An ambulance brought him in
a while ago. Possible heart attack.

12:38.184 --> 12:40.812
Sure. I'll check for you.

12:41.896 --> 12:46.276
No ambulances have checked in since
this morning and that was a pregnancy.

12:46.318 --> 12:50.196
That's impossible. The ambulance
left about five minutes before I did.

12:50.238 --> 12:54.326
They may have gone to another hospital.
Was it a private ambulance?

12:54.367 --> 12:56.578
Yeah. International Life Support.

12:56.619 --> 12:59.914
- And his doctor?
- His doctor? I don't know.

12:59.956 --> 13:03.460
Oh, wait a minute. It could be a Dr Kessler.

13:03.501 --> 13:06.046
Yeah, Dr Kessler is a cardiologist here.

13:06.087 --> 13:09.424
- Could you check with him, please?
- Sure. Let me check.

13:09.466 --> 13:12.844
'Dr Sigapelli to Cardiology.
Dr Sigapelli.'

13:12.886 --> 13:16.765
I went to the market for five minutes
and he's gone! Where is Saul?

13:16.806 --> 13:20.393
- Take it easy, Lena.
- Rick won't tell me nothing!

13:20.435 --> 13:24.481
- What's happened?
- Saul may have had a heart attack.

13:24.522 --> 13:28.193
- Oh, God, no!
- It's all right. We don't know yet.

13:28.234 --> 13:31.571
- Is there any word?
- No, not yet.

13:32.572 --> 13:35.575
Dr Kessler will be here in a moment,
but he knows nothing

13:35.617 --> 13:38.161
of a Mr Greenberg suffering a heart attack.

13:38.203 --> 13:43.333
And International Life Support haven't
dispatched an ambulance since last night.

13:44.584 --> 13:47.337
Where is he? What happened to Saul?

13:48.129 --> 13:53.134
Where is he? Please,
where is my husband? Oh, Thomas.

13:59.757 --> 14:03.636
- Please be calm.
- Why don't you go and find my husband?

14:03.677 --> 14:07.181
Why don't you just go and find my Saul
instead of torturing me!

14:07.222 --> 14:09.308
- Lena! Officer?
- Sir?

14:09.350 --> 14:12.478
Maybe if I had a couple minutes
alone with Mrs Greenberg.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.564
She's not gonna be very helpful
when she's this upset.

14:15.606 --> 14:17.942
- Sure. That's a great idea.
- Thank you.

14:17.983 --> 14:20.486
- I'll be in the doctors' lounge.
- Go ahead.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.989
- Thank you.
- 'Dr Sigapelli to cardiology.'

14:24.031 --> 14:27.368
'Dr Haywood,
you're wanted in paediatrics.'

14:27.409 --> 14:30.704
- Lena, they're just doing their job. Here.
- I know.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.998
Have some coffee.

14:34.041 --> 14:38.587
Look, Lena, I don't wanna push you,
but... Here you go.

14:38.629 --> 14:41.632
- I don't want any, thank you.
- You don't want any.

14:41.674 --> 14:45.427
Erm, I get the feeling
you know what's going on here.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.638
Lena, talk to me.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.267
'Dr Sigapelli to cardiology.
Dr Sigapelli.'

14:51.308 --> 14:57.231
I thought it was his imagination. He kept
telling me he felt them. He felt them.

14:57.273 --> 14:59.608
Wait a minute. Felt who?

15:02.069 --> 15:07.241
About two weeks ago,
he started to act different, nervous.

15:07.283 --> 15:09.994
This week, it was worse.
He couldn't even sleep.

15:10.035 --> 15:13.122
And then yesterday, he...

15:13.163 --> 15:16.208
All right. Is... er...

15:16.250 --> 15:18.919
'Janet Clark,
please report to maternity.'

15:18.961 --> 15:21.839
Lena, sit down.

15:25.843 --> 15:28.470
Is someone after Saul?

15:28.512 --> 15:31.056
Lena, you can trust me.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.183
You wouldn't believe me.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.477
Of course I'll believe you.

15:37.605 --> 15:41.191
- You'll think I'm crazy.
- Just try me, OK?

15:46.405 --> 15:48.324
Nazis.

15:48.365 --> 15:51.243
Nazis are after my Saul.

15:52.328 --> 15:54.663
You see, I told you you wouldn't believe it.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.708
Wait. It's not that. It's just...

15:58.626 --> 16:02.129
- Nazis? Are you sure?
- Yes.

16:02.171 --> 16:04.757
I mean, how do you know?

16:04.798 --> 16:07.843
Lena, of course I believe you, but...

16:09.136 --> 16:12.723
you just don't hear
this kind of stuff in Hawaii.

16:12.765 --> 16:14.850
Why would Nazis be after Saul?

16:16.894 --> 16:20.356
Saul was a member of something
called the Masada Team.

16:20.397 --> 16:24.777
- Saul was an Israeli agent?
- Tom, you know of the Masada Team?

16:25.653 --> 16:29.698
Yeah. It's a secret Israeli unit
that locates and captures war criminals.

16:29.740 --> 16:32.910
They got Eichmann
and only they know how many others.

16:32.952 --> 16:36.830
- I was in naval intelligence.
- Oh, yes. I forgot.

16:36.872 --> 16:40.793
If the Nazis were gonna murder Saul,
why would they bother...

16:42.002 --> 16:45.339
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. You're right.

16:45.381 --> 16:48.926
You're right. Only they want him alive.

16:48.968 --> 16:51.220
They don't want him dead.

16:51.929 --> 16:55.432
You see, before Saul retired
from the Masada Team,

16:55.474 --> 16:57.851
he was a deputy commander

16:57.893 --> 17:03.399
and he knows operating procedures,
he knows names, lists.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.652
They will keep him alive at least for a while.

17:06.694 --> 17:11.031
- It's all right. It's OK.
- 'Dr Sigapelli to cardiology.'

17:12.825 --> 17:16.328
Lena, we're going to have to tell the police.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.163
- No. No.
- Lena.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.874
No. Saul knew we were being watched.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.836
Our people are coming.
They will take care of this.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.881
There is nothing for the police to do
but stand in their way.

17:27.923 --> 17:31.302
Please. Please, Tom, trust me.

17:31.343 --> 17:35.180
Please. I have been through this before.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.142
Please. Please.

17:48.569 --> 17:53.741
'Dr Haywood, you're wanted
in paediatrics. Dr Haywood to paediatrics.'

17:53.782 --> 17:57.077
Lena, look, you asked me to trust you.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.872
- You're gonna have to trust me, OK?
- OK.

17:59.914 --> 18:02.166
Feeling calmer, Lena?

18:05.377 --> 18:09.006
'Janet Clark,
please report to maternity.'

18:09.048 --> 18:12.301
Mr Magnum, did you find out
why they kidnapped her husband?

18:12.343 --> 18:14.428
- They must be meshugina.
- What?

18:14.470 --> 18:16.722
That's Yiddish for crazy.

18:18.015 --> 18:21.226
- Will you be at this Lenai Street address?
- Yes.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.812
No. She'll be at Robin Masters'
estate with me.

18:23.854 --> 18:26.065
I will be staying at my own house.

18:26.815 --> 18:30.027
You can reach her at the estate
or through Rick at the club.

18:30.069 --> 18:31.987
You can reach me at my own house.

18:32.029 --> 18:34.657
Won't you be more comfortable
at Robin's Nest

18:34.698 --> 18:37.409
until your relatives arrive from the mainland?

18:40.329 --> 18:41.956
OK.

18:41.997 --> 18:45.542
Mrs Greenberg, one last thing.
If you think of anything else...

18:45.584 --> 18:48.128
- I will call you!
- Fine. Thank you.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.256
They make me so nervous.

18:51.674 --> 18:56.136
Now, why do I have to stay
at this Robin's Nest?

18:56.178 --> 19:00.015
- Why does she have to stay there?
- Because they might try and grab her.

19:00.057 --> 19:02.559
They don't want me. They want Saul.

19:02.601 --> 19:05.229
They don't want her. They want Saul.

19:06.063 --> 19:08.315
- You know who's got Saul?
- No.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.609
Mrs Greenberg?

19:10.651 --> 19:12.736
'Dr Haywood to paediatrics.'

19:12.778 --> 19:15.781
Sorry you had to wait.
I was in surgery. I'm Dr Kessler.

19:15.823 --> 19:18.325
You are not my husband's doctor.

19:18.367 --> 19:20.536
Are you Saul Greenberg's doctor?

19:20.578 --> 19:23.497
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- No.

19:23.539 --> 19:28.335
Dr Brandon is his physician, but he's
on vacation. I've treated him in the interim.

19:28.377 --> 19:31.589
- Look. His name's on the prescription.
- I didn't know.

19:31.630 --> 19:34.550
- Did you prescribe those for Saul?
- Yes, I did.

19:34.592 --> 19:37.636
- Does he need them?
- They're nitroglycerine tablets -

19:37.678 --> 19:40.014
only to be taken in case of a heart attack.

19:41.390 --> 19:44.685
Has Mr Greenberg suffered a seizure?

20:01.076 --> 20:04.204
- Ruben?
- Yeah, I'm back.

20:12.421 --> 20:14.506
- How is he?
- He's still out.

20:14.548 --> 20:17.718
His heart seems steadier though.
You have any problems?

20:17.760 --> 20:21.889
No, I left the ambulance in a dirt road
off the jungle in Koko Head.

20:21.931 --> 20:26.268
But coming back, a coastguard cutter
was dropping black flags in the water.

20:26.310 --> 20:29.647
- It must be some kind of a warning.
- Yeah, maybe to keep us in.

20:29.688 --> 20:33.192
Don't worry. We'll get out of here
tomorrow, no matter what.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.361
- And the woman?
- We'll get her too.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.824
- Give him an injection!
- What about his heart?

20:40.866 --> 20:43.369
The hell with his heart! Inject him!

20:52.962 --> 20:54.797
Hello.

20:54.838 --> 20:56.799
He tried to escape.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.093
He was pretending to be unconscious.

20:59.134 --> 21:02.638
I gave him another injection.
Now he doesn't have to pretend.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.765
He has a weak heart.

21:04.807 --> 21:07.142
You can only give him 30ccs within...

21:07.184 --> 21:10.437
Listen, we know what we're doing.
Is there anything else?

21:10.479 --> 21:15.276
I've located the woman.
She is at the Robin Masters estate

21:15.317 --> 21:17.486
with a man named Magnum.

21:21.615 --> 21:24.827
- Yes, Mr Masters?
- 'Higgins, it's me.'

21:24.868 --> 21:27.288
How did you get this number?
I had it changed.

21:27.329 --> 21:30.833
'I was lucky, I guess. I have a little problem.'

21:30.874 --> 21:35.170
- How perceptive of you.
- Higgins, I can't get out of the car.

21:35.212 --> 21:37.506
'The car? You've wrecked the car?'

21:37.548 --> 21:40.676
No, I haven't wrecked it.
I just can't get out of it.

21:40.718 --> 21:44.597
- Where are you?
- In the Audi.

21:44.638 --> 21:46.807
The Audi?

22:02.364 --> 22:06.285
- Very clever, Magnum.
- 'Just get the dogs, Higgins.

22:06.327 --> 22:08.203
'Get the dogs.'

22:09.788 --> 22:14.251
Tommy, this is silly of you
to bring me to this fancy house.

22:14.293 --> 22:17.004
You wouldn't want me
to take you some place sleazy?

22:17.046 --> 22:19.381
That would be more in character.

22:21.258 --> 22:25.387
- More tea, Mrs Greenberg?
- Yes, please.

22:30.100 --> 22:34.521
Er, forgive me. It's been a long time
since I've seen anything like that.

22:34.563 --> 22:38.067
Oh, I wear this to hide it.
It's so ugly, you know.

22:39.652 --> 22:42.947
- And may I ask which camp?
- Jadwiga, Poland.

22:43.864 --> 22:45.741
It was long ago.

22:47.117 --> 22:49.703
I am sorry.

22:51.789 --> 22:53.958
Don't be sorry for me.

22:53.999 --> 22:56.752
Because Saul and I, we survived.

22:58.087 --> 23:00.839
But it never ends.

23:00.881 --> 23:03.008
Now they got Saul again.

23:03.050 --> 23:05.928
Now, Lena, we'll get him. Don't worry.

23:05.970 --> 23:08.722
When are your people coming in?

23:08.764 --> 23:11.642
I'm not sure. Tonight, tomorrow.

23:11.684 --> 23:13.811
They don't give you a schedule.

23:13.852 --> 23:17.064
But they will try to contact us at my house.

23:17.106 --> 23:20.734
Rick's working on that.
Calls to your number will be switched here.

23:21.318 --> 23:24.613
- How does he do that?
- Illegally, I'll wager.

23:25.239 --> 23:27.908
He has connections.

23:27.950 --> 23:31.495
Tommy, you still have to take me
to my home.

23:31.537 --> 23:33.622
Lena, we have been all through that.

23:33.664 --> 23:36.792
I don't have any clothes.
Nothing, not even a toothbrush.

23:36.834 --> 23:40.129
- I'll get whatever you need.
- You don't know what to get.

23:40.170 --> 23:43.299
I'll bring a little bit of everything.

23:43.340 --> 23:46.594
Tommy, my personal stuff.

23:48.095 --> 23:51.056
I'll keep my eyes closed, I promise.

23:59.898 --> 24:02.276
He's such a good man, isn't he?

24:07.156 --> 24:11.327
'I wanted to get Lena's things quickly
and get back to the house.

24:11.368 --> 24:14.038
'I don't know what it was -
a feeling, I guess -

24:14.079 --> 24:16.165
'but I was bothered by something.

24:16.206 --> 24:18.584
'Maybe I just didn't trust Higgins with her.

24:18.626 --> 24:22.922
'Anyway, I'd feel better
the sooner I got back to the estate.

25:05.631 --> 25:09.551
'What I really didn't like was invading
the privacy of their home,

25:09.593 --> 25:14.098
'especially since I knew
what they'd experienced in the past.

25:14.139 --> 25:17.601
'I felt strange going through
Lena's things, which was silly.

25:17.643 --> 25:20.229
'I'd seen this kind of stuff before.

25:21.230 --> 25:23.649
'Well, most of it, anyhow.

25:37.913 --> 25:39.999
'If I couldn't take Saul back to her,

25:40.040 --> 25:42.626
'I could at least take back
a pleasant memory.'

26:00.978 --> 26:03.272
We don't know
what we're up against.

26:07.318 --> 26:09.987
This was taken in Suez
with my messmates.

26:10.029 --> 26:13.324
That was in 1946, right after the war.

26:15.743 --> 26:17.828
Karl.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.874
It's dark. She must be in the main house.

26:21.916 --> 26:24.335
With how many others?
I only have four shots.

26:24.376 --> 26:26.712
Don't worry. That'll be enough.

26:27.379 --> 26:30.716
The pictures are wonderful, Higgins.

26:30.758 --> 26:32.843
But I have such a headache. Do you mind?

26:32.885 --> 26:35.804
Oh, how inconsiderate of me.
You must be exhausted.

26:35.846 --> 26:39.558
Can I get you anything?
An aspirin? Some chicken soup?

26:39.600 --> 26:43.020
You're so kind. Thank you. Just a little rest.

26:43.062 --> 26:46.231
I'll show you to your room.

26:48.901 --> 26:51.320
What's wrong with them, Higgins?

26:53.739 --> 26:55.824
Higgins.

26:55.866 --> 27:01.288
Stay here. Don't leave the room under
any circumstances. Stay, lads. Guard.

27:42.121 --> 27:44.206
Go.

28:30.169 --> 28:32.713
Halt!

28:34.590 --> 28:36.091
Go! Guard!

28:50.856 --> 28:53.984
'I broke the speed record
on the way to Robin's

28:54.026 --> 28:56.654
'but even so, I was too late.

28:56.695 --> 29:00.157
'And my fears were no longer just fears.'

29:13.712 --> 29:15.798
Higgins.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.551
Stop it!

29:29.478 --> 29:32.982
Why can't you go after real intruders
the way you go after me?

29:43.826 --> 29:47.788
TC, it's Magnum. Don't hang up.
Just get the chopper over to Robin's.

29:47.830 --> 29:51.125
Are you crazy? Do you realise
how much it's costing

29:51.166 --> 29:54.503
to have this book-keeper
come in and work overtime?

29:54.545 --> 29:56.797
Plus, I'm tryin' to convince her...

29:56.839 --> 29:59.383
TC, I've gotta get Higgins to the hospital.

29:59.425 --> 30:01.719
Higgins?

30:01.760 --> 30:05.723
- Hey, man, you didn't finally...
- TC, I need you here now.

30:19.278 --> 30:21.655
Higgins, how are you feeling, anyway?

30:21.739 --> 30:24.533
Hopelessly inebriated.

30:24.575 --> 30:26.660
Yeah, well, I know the feeling, boy.

30:26.702 --> 30:29.038
The drugs'll wear off in a couple hours.

30:29.079 --> 30:33.000
I was able to pull the dart out
before the full dose penetrated.

30:33.042 --> 30:37.046
It doesn't work that way.
You got the full dose the second it hit.

30:37.087 --> 30:39.340
It just wasn't lethal. What happened?

30:39.381 --> 30:42.718
I was in the living room with Lena when...

30:42.760 --> 30:45.054
What the bloody hell?

30:50.809 --> 30:53.020
TC, you're moving the bed.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.440
TC!

30:56.482 --> 30:58.567
Hm?

30:58.609 --> 31:00.361
Oh, I'm doin' that?

31:00.402 --> 31:03.948
I was tryin' to get the TV to come on.
I wanted to watch the ball game.

31:03.989 --> 31:07.785
But you wouldn't let me watch
the ball game, would you?

31:07.826 --> 31:11.205
I didn't think you would.
I'll go to the maternity ward

31:11.247 --> 31:15.751
and watch the game with
some of those expectant fathers down there.

31:15.876 --> 31:19.004
Hey, just holler
when you get ready to go, OK?

31:19.046 --> 31:20.923
Oh, yeah. By the way, man.

31:20.965 --> 31:23.759
Watch those gowns
when you get up and move around.

31:23.842 --> 31:27.346
They have a tendency to fly open
in the back. You know what I mean?

31:32.184 --> 31:34.270
He means well.

31:34.311 --> 31:36.605
Down. Right.

31:39.650 --> 31:41.735
Thank you.

31:43.070 --> 31:47.157
- They got Lena, didn't they?
- Higgins, it's not your fault.

31:47.783 --> 31:49.577
Zeus? Apollo?

31:49.618 --> 31:53.289
They're fine. They're the only ones
who didn't get hurt.

31:53.330 --> 31:55.916
They got Lena without taking me lads?

31:56.584 --> 31:58.544
They weren't with you?

31:58.586 --> 32:01.505
They were with her.
I ordered them to stay to guard her.

32:01.547 --> 32:03.507
She must've let them out herself.

32:03.549 --> 32:06.051
How many people hit the estate?

32:06.093 --> 32:10.097
I only saw one but there had to be another -
the one who shot me.

32:10.139 --> 32:13.058
Why didn't she stay with the lads?

32:13.100 --> 32:17.062
She's pretty tough.
She probably let 'em out to help you.

32:18.856 --> 32:21.317
I'm tired. Why don't you go?

32:22.985 --> 32:25.070
Sure.

32:26.071 --> 32:28.365
Magnum.

32:28.407 --> 32:32.077
Feed the lads, will you?
There are steaks in the freezer.

32:34.788 --> 32:37.583
Very well. You can have one too.

32:52.848 --> 32:54.475
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:54.516 --> 32:56.769
Do you know where
Dr Kessler's office is?

32:56.810 --> 32:59.563
It's just down the hall.
But he's not there now.

32:59.605 --> 33:03.025
He could be. He's taking off tomorrow
so he might be catching up.

33:03.067 --> 33:06.654
- He's going on vacation?
- Sort of a long weekend on his boat.

33:06.695 --> 33:08.781
Well, I'll just check and see if he's in.

33:08.822 --> 33:11.909
'Nurse Emery,
admissions desk, please.'

33:11.951 --> 33:16.705
'The only people who knew Lena was
at Robin's Nest were Rick and the police.

33:16.747 --> 33:20.793
'But then I remembered there was
someone else in on that conversation.'

33:23.921 --> 33:27.049
'Nurse Emery,
admissions desk, please.'

33:29.885 --> 33:32.263
Hi. How you doin'?

33:47.361 --> 33:50.698
'And when I thought back
on all that had happened

33:50.739 --> 33:53.158
'things began to fall into place.

33:56.078 --> 33:59.206
'Saul's premonitions
began about two weeks ago,

33:59.248 --> 34:02.459
'the same time Kessler
took over as his doctor.

34:02.501 --> 34:05.296
'And then there was
the method of abduction -

34:05.337 --> 34:07.131
'an ambulance

34:07.172 --> 34:09.341
'and a prescription.'

34:14.388 --> 34:18.809
'Janet Clark,
please report to maternity. Janet Clark.

34:27.985 --> 34:32.072
'Janet Clark, please report to maternity.
Janet Clark.'

34:43.000 --> 34:46.337
'A medical file wasn't exactly
incriminating evidence,

34:46.378 --> 34:50.757
'except the one I found on Saul had a little
bit more than just his blood pressure.

34:50.799 --> 34:53.552
'I couldn't make out
Kessler's handwriting

34:53.594 --> 34:57.681
'but I only had to see one word
to confirm my suspicion.

34:57.723 --> 34:59.808
'Jadwiga.'

35:09.401 --> 35:11.237
- Hello?
- 'Dr Kessler?'

35:11.278 --> 35:14.198
- Yes.
- I'd like to speak to the Greenbergs.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.826
- Are they there?
- Who is this?

35:17.868 --> 35:22.706
'It's an old friend of the Greenbergs.
I heard they're staying with you.'

35:22.748 --> 35:24.917
I don't know what you mean. Who is this?

35:24.959 --> 35:28.295
This is Magnum. I've been
sitting around in your office,

35:28.337 --> 35:32.549
- going over some interesting items.
- 'I could have you arrested.'

35:32.591 --> 35:36.262
That's a good idea. Then you
and the cops can come down here

35:36.303 --> 35:40.099
and we can all sit around
and reminisce about Nazi prison camps.

35:40.140 --> 35:43.227
- Sound like a good time?
- You do not understand.

35:43.269 --> 35:47.231
'Then you can explain it to me.
Where are the Greenbergs?'

35:49.316 --> 35:52.736
Can you come over to my home
in 30 minutes, alone?

35:52.778 --> 35:54.863
30 minutes.

35:54.905 --> 35:58.742
'He might bring in some of his friends,
but that was OK. So would I.'

36:06.417 --> 36:08.836
- The gates are open.
- Terrific.

36:08.877 --> 36:12.756
I suppose they got a candle
burning in their window for us too.

36:12.798 --> 36:16.218
Thomas, I don't know if I'm ready for Nazis.
Where's TC?

36:16.260 --> 36:20.431
- I couldn't get a hold of him.
- Well, maybe I should've tried.

36:22.141 --> 36:27.521
Give me five minutes to work my way round
the beach side, then make the delivery.

36:27.563 --> 36:32.401
- I don't like this. It stinks.
- You should've brought fresh sushi.

37:39.510 --> 37:43.806
AhÃ­ Sushi Delivery.
Your wish for fish come true.

38:01.657 --> 38:06.036
AhÃ­ Sushi Delivery.
Your wish for fish come true.

38:15.228 --> 38:19.774
Couldn't find anything out, huh?
OK. Yeah, thanks.

38:22.443 --> 38:24.529
Nothing.

38:24.570 --> 38:27.073
Not one call to Lena and Saul's number.

38:31.119 --> 38:34.539
It had to be that Masada Team
that killed him.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.666
Well, how'd they find him?

38:36.708 --> 38:40.670
Besides, his throat was cut.
It's not their style.

38:44.924 --> 38:47.010
Damn.

38:47.051 --> 38:49.137
What?

38:57.562 --> 39:00.732
Kessler was a Jew. Thomas?

39:06.779 --> 39:10.033
If you were a Nazi
and didn't want anybody to know,

39:10.074 --> 39:12.702
how do you convince everybody
that you weren't?

39:12.744 --> 39:15.663
Put on a yarmulke
and stay away from bacon.

39:17.707 --> 39:20.043
Kessler was a Nazi passing as a Jew.

39:22.003 --> 39:24.088
Maybe.

39:26.966 --> 39:31.429
A little older and a little greyer
but they still look the same.

39:31.471 --> 39:35.850
Kessler must've recognised Saul
the minute he laid eyes on him.

39:38.686 --> 39:41.022
When do you think that picture was taken?

39:41.064 --> 39:44.859
I don't know. Early '50s, maybe. '52, '53?

39:45.526 --> 39:48.363
- After the war?
- Oh, yeah, for sure.

39:51.908 --> 39:53.993
Look at Lena's arm.

39:54.035 --> 39:56.662
Her right arm.

39:56.704 --> 39:58.831
So? I don't see nothing.

39:58.873 --> 40:01.459
No. Not even a tattoo.

40:02.418 --> 40:04.587
Oh, Thomas.

40:08.132 --> 40:10.343
Kessler's a Jew.

40:13.638 --> 40:15.890
Saul and Lena aren't.

40:35.910 --> 40:39.872
It's no good. Kessler was right.
We gave him too much.

40:39.914 --> 40:42.250
I'm not gonna lose him now.

40:42.291 --> 40:44.711
I think I hear him coming.

40:54.929 --> 40:58.683
- He's waving to us.
- Get him down here quick.

41:30.173 --> 41:32.258
Juden.

41:38.806 --> 41:40.892
Jew.

41:42.435 --> 41:44.687
Ah!

41:54.155 --> 41:57.992
I just can't believe it. I can't believe
that Lena and Saul are Nazis.

41:58.034 --> 42:00.995
I know. I wanted to think
that photo was retouched,

42:01.037 --> 42:04.332
that Lena was embarrassed
about the tattoo but it wasn't.

42:04.374 --> 42:07.043
We'll know for sure
if they're at Kessler's boat.

42:07.085 --> 42:08.670
They're on it.

42:09.212 --> 42:13.758
So Lena killed Kessler?
It ties in with everything else.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.677
She let the dogs go, then snuck out

42:15.718 --> 42:19.055
while Higgins was tangling
with the guys who hit the estate.

42:19.097 --> 42:23.976
No wonder she didn't wanna stay at
Robin's. It delayed her plan to get Kessler.

42:36.531 --> 42:39.659
That's Kessler's car.
It's got a hospital sticker.

42:47.041 --> 42:51.838
- It's the guy from the ambulance.
- His throat's cut, just like Kessler's.

42:56.009 --> 42:58.886
Hey! Wait up! Hey, wait up! Wait a minute!

42:59.679 --> 43:01.764
Thomas.

43:15.778 --> 43:18.406
What, are you training for the decathlon?

43:18.448 --> 43:20.491
I'm gonna call the coastguard!

44:26.724 --> 44:29.310
Saul. Saul.

44:31.354 --> 44:33.856
Saul.

44:33.898 --> 44:36.401
- Oh, my darling.
- Lena.

44:37.068 --> 44:39.612
Tom. Tommy.

44:40.738 --> 44:44.867
It is too late. They killed my Saul.

44:44.909 --> 44:48.454
They killed my husband. They killed my...

44:54.085 --> 44:56.045
Drop the scalpel.

44:56.087 --> 45:01.217
Don't you understand?
They killed my husband.

45:01.259 --> 45:03.511
They killed Saul.

45:04.679 --> 45:08.641
The bracelet that keeps slipping
was a nice touch. When did you buy it?

45:09.308 --> 45:12.228
Same time you had the tattoos
put on after the war?

45:12.270 --> 45:14.355
Tommy, what are you saying?

45:20.903 --> 45:25.992
- Where's the tattoos, Lena?
- That picture was taken in Salzburg,

45:26.034 --> 45:28.244
on my honeymoon.

45:28.286 --> 45:30.997
In Salzburg.

45:31.039 --> 45:33.207
My honeymoon.

45:39.630 --> 45:42.467
They had no right to hunt us like animals.

45:42.508 --> 45:44.594
That's probably what Kessler thought.

45:44.635 --> 45:47.180
- They are different!
- How are they different?

45:47.221 --> 45:49.682
They are Jews! They are Jews!

45:49.724 --> 45:53.436
We never lived like them.
Not in here, not in our hearts!

45:53.478 --> 45:55.605
We only pretended to be Jews.

45:55.646 --> 45:59.650
- Like murdering Kessler?
- He recognised Saul. He set them on us.

45:59.692 --> 46:02.695
Why? Because Saul
gassed his mother or his father?

46:02.737 --> 46:05.948
Is that how he remembered Saul,
Lena? Or you?

46:05.990 --> 46:10.119
It was war! It was war!

46:10.161 --> 46:13.289
Don't you understand?
The bombs were falling!

46:13.331 --> 46:15.416
It was war!

46:15.458 --> 46:19.253
You talk to me about something
you know nothing about!

46:19.295 --> 46:21.547
You weren't even born then.

46:21.589 --> 46:24.217
- It was war.
- The scalpel, Lena.

46:25.134 --> 46:27.220
Drop it.

46:28.429 --> 46:30.515
Drop it.

46:30.556 --> 46:32.809
It's over, Lena.

46:36.729 --> 46:38.815
Ja.

46:40.358 --> 46:43.236
I guess it finally is.

47:10.221 --> 47:12.682
Hello, lads.

47:12.724 --> 47:14.809
Missed me, did you?

47:18.438 --> 47:20.690
Zeus, Apollo, patrol.

47:49.552 --> 47:51.512
Magnum,

47:51.554 --> 47:54.724
some friends of Robin Masters,
Australian stewardesses,

47:54.766 --> 47:57.060
are coming to town this afternoon.

47:57.101 --> 47:59.187
I had promised to show them the town

47:59.228 --> 48:03.316
but after my incapacitation,
I'm really not quite up to sightseeing.

48:03.358 --> 48:06.569
I thought I might perhaps impose upon you.

48:06.611 --> 48:08.696
Sure.

48:11.949 --> 48:14.660
I was there, you know.

48:14.702 --> 48:18.456
- Where?
- Nuremberg, during the trials.

48:21.125 --> 48:23.336
They all had excuses,

48:23.378 --> 48:25.463
reasons for doing what they did.

48:26.297 --> 48:28.716
Even the so-called little fish.

48:29.926 --> 48:33.513
But when you saw the films, the camps,

48:34.597 --> 48:36.974
you realised there were no little fish.

48:39.060 --> 48:40.978
I just thought you ought to know.

48:44.607 --> 48:47.235
Higgins.

48:47.276 --> 48:49.362
Thank you.

48:54.283 --> 48:57.495
Of course, this changes nothing
between us.

48:58.997 --> 49:02.125
I expect you to respect
the rules and regulations

49:02.166 --> 49:04.919
pertaining to your stay on the estate.

49:04.961 --> 49:07.422
There will be no wild parties,

49:07.463 --> 49:09.716
no outrageous liberties,

49:09.799 --> 49:12.635
no unauthorised overnight guests.
