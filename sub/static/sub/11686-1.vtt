WEBVTT

00:09.440 --> 00:11.090
I just got fired.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.805
And what about me?

00:19.360 --> 00:21.124
What about you?

00:21.320 --> 00:22.321
What about me?

00:23.600 --> 00:24.761
Okay. That's it.

00:25.640 --> 00:28.325
I'm going over there right fucking now,
before they leave and...

00:28.760 --> 00:30.603
Erlich, I'm gonna use your car.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.331
Jared, you call Ron LaFlamme,
tell him to meet me there.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.765
Fuck these assholes!

00:34.840 --> 00:37.320
Wait. Richard, I'm coming with you.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.164
Here. Jared, clear this.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.241
Get all the smoke out of it.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.442
- Otherwise, it damages the device.
- Um...

00:42.560 --> 00:45.291
Don't be a pussy.

00:47.760 --> 00:48.841
How could they do this?

00:48.920 --> 00:50.604
How could they fire me
from my own company?

00:50.680 --> 00:52.284
Just stay calm.
We're gonna fight this.

00:52.360 --> 00:53.725
Jesus, Richard, slow down.

00:54.240 --> 00:55.366
Stop, stop, stop!

00:55.440 --> 00:57.647
Ah!

01:00.280 --> 01:01.850
Did I just hit a deer?

01:01.920 --> 01:03.251
No, God damn it!

01:03.480 --> 01:05.084
Fucking Stanford Robotics.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.162
Shit. Is this gonna make us late?

01:07.320 --> 01:09.448
Oh. They killed the Bam-bot.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.002
Fuck your Bam-bot!
You little Stanford cunts fucked up my grille!

01:16.080 --> 01:17.889
- Fucking piece of shit!
- Wait.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.007
You little cunt!

01:20.160 --> 01:21.127
- Fuck!
- Hey.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.565
This one's for your mama.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.847
Erlich, stop. Come on.
Erlich, we've got to get to Raviga.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.490
Hey, oh, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.521
Thanks for coming, Ron.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.285
I'd bail on spin class
any day for you, Richie.

01:41.360 --> 01:43.761
Richard. Richard.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.524
I kept calling, you weren't answering.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.284
Talk to the hand, Monica.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.601
Richard, can you stop? I can explain, okay?

01:49.680 --> 01:53.241
It's pretty self-explanatory, Monica.
You voted to fire me.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.370
What the fuck?

01:55.440 --> 01:59.490
I mean, there is no way
I'm letting you push me out of this.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.483
Our intention is not to push you out.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.204
We wish rather to transition you

02:03.280 --> 02:05.169
to a more appropriate role
within the company.

02:05.240 --> 02:08.163
A new CEO will be brought in
to manage day-to-day operations

02:08.240 --> 02:12.529
while you assume the role
of Chief Technology Officer.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.329
Congratulations.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.129
- CTO?
- Yes.

02:16.240 --> 02:19.961
You want me to be an employee
at my own company?

02:20.040 --> 02:22.168
You would still be in charge
of the engineering,

02:22.240 --> 02:25.369
and you'd continue vesting your shares,
and keep your board seat.

02:25.440 --> 02:29.525
Oh, the same seat I had an hour ago
when you voted to fire me as CEO?

02:29.600 --> 02:31.887
- That came in handy.
- Richard, please.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.442
I realize this may be bittersweet,
but earlier this evening,

02:35.520 --> 02:38.922
Raviga decided to officially fund
Pied Piper Series A Round

02:39.000 --> 02:41.924
at $5 million at a $50-million valuation.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.926
Essentially, you have created
a company that is too valuable for you to run.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.001
You should feel good about that.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.684
Are you kidding me?
I made the company, okay?

02:48.760 --> 02:51.127
I'm the one who came up
with the name "Pied Piper."

02:51.680 --> 02:52.681
Yes.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.524
Ron, can I have a word, please?

03:00.480 --> 03:02.209
They can't really do this, can they?

03:02.280 --> 03:04.487
I think they just did.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.245
You remember that shit deal
you brought me from Hanneman,

03:07.320 --> 03:09.402
and I said, "Hey, Richie, this is a shit deal,"

03:09.480 --> 03:10.527
but you took it anyway

03:10.600 --> 03:13.649
because you wanted to do
something crazy for once in your life?

03:13.720 --> 03:14.881
Yes, I remember.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.282
Well, you basically just loaded a gun
and handed it to Hanneman,

03:18.360 --> 03:20.522
and Hanneman sold that gun to Raviga,

03:20.600 --> 03:23.285
and then Raviga just fucking
pistol-whipped you.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.481
But, hey, at least they're letting you keep
your shares and your board seat.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.251
You lose a little blood
with the dilution for the new CEO,

03:30.320 --> 03:32.163
but I've seen worse.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.163
Like that shit deal
you brought me from Hanneman.

03:36.480 --> 03:40.883
If we give Richard a little bit of space,
he'll be able to wrap his head around this,

03:40.960 --> 03:43.486
and a smooth transition
to a new CEO will be possible.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.689
To wit, I served as the CEO of...

03:46.760 --> 03:48.922
Mr. Bachman.

03:49.040 --> 03:52.567
In the version of Pied Piper
in which I am invested,

03:52.640 --> 03:56.326
you will not be CEO. Not now. Not ever.

03:56.880 --> 04:00.930
Well, you, madam,
are a shrew of the first order.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.288
Okay. I'm not gonna let you do this.
I'm gonna fight it.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.771
I understand you're upset.

04:05.880 --> 04:09.680
As you can see, this is
a very emotional time for me as well,

04:09.760 --> 04:13.560
but we have some very strong candidates
coming in for the CEO position,

04:13.640 --> 04:15.768
and we would so appreciate your input.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.683
- My input?
- Mmm.

04:17.959 --> 04:21.327
You want me to help you pick
my new replacement?

04:21.800 --> 04:23.290
I'd rather quit.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.089
And I don't care how much money I lose,

04:25.200 --> 04:28.966
because I am gonna get it all back
when I sue the living shit out of you!

04:33.080 --> 04:35.208
Okay. All right. All right.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.201
Ron, let's go.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.442
I'm sorry, I'm forced to inform you

04:40.520 --> 04:43.763
that I can no longer provide you
with legal counsel.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.840
What are you talking about?
You're my attorney.

04:47.080 --> 04:51.165
No. Technically,
I'm Pied Piper's corporate counsel,

04:51.520 --> 04:53.966
and you just declared your intention to walk.

04:54.040 --> 04:58.728
So, in effect,
you kind of just threatened to sue me,

04:58.800 --> 05:01.406
and I don't take kindly
to threats, Mr. Hendricks.

05:01.880 --> 05:05.805
"Mr. Hendricks"? What happened to "Richie"?

05:05.880 --> 05:07.962
Unfortunately, I'm not
at liberty to discuss him

05:08.040 --> 05:09.644
with you, either, Mr. Hendricks.

05:12.560 --> 05:16.326
Richard, if I didn't vote to remove you,
then Laurie would've adjourned the meeting,

05:16.400 --> 05:18.641
replaced my seat on the board
with someone else at Raviga,

05:18.720 --> 05:20.449
and then they would've voted to remove you.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.284
At least this way, I'm still in the game.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.442
No. You mean,
at least this way, you kept your job.

05:25.080 --> 05:28.129
At least the actual Judas
had the courtesy to kill himself

05:28.200 --> 05:30.680
after betraying his leader, Jesus Christ.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.081
He's the CEO of the world. Ever heard of him?

05:33.160 --> 05:34.889
Yeah. Got it. Went to Catholic school.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.121
Really? How long?

05:36.920 --> 05:41.608
Look, I'm still on the board of this company.
I'll be in all of the meetings.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.364
Maybe I can be helpful at some point.

05:43.440 --> 05:47.331
You wanna be helpful, Monica?
Convince Laurie to keep me on as CEO.

05:47.400 --> 05:51.689
Look, I know I made some mistakes.
I wasn't perfect, but I'll get better.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.367
I'll even go to one of those CEO coaches,
like that guy at fucking Twitter.

05:55.440 --> 05:59.161
Richard, it's done.
Laurie already found a new CEO.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.881
What? Already?

06:00.960 --> 06:03.201
You said that you didn't want
to be part of the interview process,

06:03.280 --> 06:05.089
so, they picked someone this morning.

06:05.160 --> 06:09.370
Jack Barker.
He's an incredibly skilled, top-notch CEO.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.169
I don't care who he is, okay? None of us do.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.961
"Action" Jack Barker?

06:16.480 --> 06:19.723
Seriously? They picked that
gray-haired fossil over me?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.450
You said you turned the job down.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.650
I said it was mutual.

06:23.840 --> 06:24.887
Oh.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.371
What? That's accurate.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.363
Oh, he ran Entercross Systems.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.649
They IPO'ed in 1998 for
more than a billion dollars.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.729
Yeah, 20 fucking years ago.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.768
Tech 1.0. What has he done lately?

06:35.840 --> 06:38.571
After that, he ran Turnwire for four years

06:38.640 --> 06:42.042
until it was acquired
by Microsoft for $2 billion.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.327
Holy shit. This guy's a hitter.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.165
He was, in the aughts.
What's he done in the 20-teens?

06:47.920 --> 06:51.811
Looks like he started a foundation
in his mother's name to cure cancer.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.609
Yeah, how's that going?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.603
Yeah. I bet his mother's dead.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.251
Yeah, that's probably why
he started the foundation.

06:59.280 --> 07:02.762
Richard, Laurie's meeting with him tomorrow.
You should come in and talk with him.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.524
No fucking way.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.250
Think this through. I mean, you have to know

07:06.360 --> 07:08.362
that you can't start
another compression company.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.842
No VC will fund that out of fear of being sued,

07:11.920 --> 07:14.207
and, I mean, unless you have
some totally different,

07:14.280 --> 07:15.964
game-changing idea lying around...

07:16.080 --> 07:18.481
So, you're saying that I'm fucked if I leave?

07:18.880 --> 07:20.644
No, I'm saying that...

07:20.720 --> 07:23.769
Okay. Well, then I guess I'm fucked,
because I'm out.

07:23.880 --> 07:27.202
And when I leave,
Jared's out, Dinesh is out, Gilfoyle is out.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.527
Everybody's out.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.443
So, good luck
with the company there, Monica.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.170
It'll just be you, Laurie Bream,

07:32.240 --> 07:35.050
and some fucking asshole
who can't even cure cancer.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.723
He's right. Where Richard goes, I go.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.124
Monica, excuse how high I am,

07:44.200 --> 07:47.090
but are the uniforms in Catholic schools
as low-out as they are online?

07:47.160 --> 07:48.207
Fuck off.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.684
Did you tell Richard you were out?

07:53.240 --> 07:54.401
No. Did you?

07:54.840 --> 07:55.887
No.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.801
Are we out?

07:59.360 --> 08:00.361
Hmm.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.606
Did Gavin tell you what this is about?

08:07.680 --> 08:09.842
We haven't spoken in some time.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.043
<i>Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.</i>

08:19.400 --> 08:21.084
<i>I have a difficult announcement to make.</i>

08:21.600 --> 08:24.809
<i>We in the tech business
often refer to failure as a good thing.</i>

08:24.880 --> 08:27.247
<i>Failure is growth. Failure is learning.</i>

08:27.880 --> 08:30.884
<i>But sometimes, failure is just failure.</i>

08:31.960 --> 08:33.200
<i>I think...</i>

08:36.760 --> 08:38.409
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

08:38.480 --> 08:39.606
<i>I didn't think it would be this hard.</i>

08:40.720 --> 08:45.248
<i>But goodbyes are always hard,
especially when I am the one saying goodbye.</i>

08:46.000 --> 08:47.889
<i>Today, effective immediately,</i>

08:48.440 --> 08:52.001
<i>I, Gavin Belson, founder and CEO of Hooli,</i>

08:52.080 --> 08:57.246
<i>am forced to officially say goodbye
to the entire Nucleus division.</i>

08:58.960 --> 09:02.089
<i>All Nucleus personnel
will be given proper notice and terminated.</i>

09:02.160 --> 09:03.525
<i>But make no mistake.</i>

09:03.600 --> 09:04.931
<i>Though they're the ones leaving,</i>

09:05.280 --> 09:09.968
<i>it is I who must remain
and bear the heavy burden of their failure.</i>

09:10.040 --> 09:11.883
<i>It is my fault.</i>

09:11.960 --> 09:15.248
<i>I trusted them to get the job done.</i>

09:15.320 --> 09:17.721
<i>But that is the price of leadership.</i>

09:19.560 --> 09:20.561
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:23.840 --> 09:26.047
That was the gutsiest thing I've ever seen.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.326
Amazing.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.365
So, wait, does that mean...

09:30.400 --> 09:31.606
Uh...

09:31.840 --> 09:34.286
Denpok? Can I have your Big Gulp?

09:44.280 --> 09:47.727
I know we keep saying this,
but even though Richard is a great guy...

09:47.800 --> 09:48.926
And a brilliant coder.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.490
He's wonderful.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.244
Nevertheless,

09:52.360 --> 09:53.850
he is lacking in certain...

09:55.120 --> 09:57.043
...managerial capacities.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.326
- Totally fair.
-It's fair, right?

09:58.400 --> 09:59.640
He's still a great coder.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.643
And an amazing human being.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.370
- Okay, look.
- Such...

10:03.440 --> 10:05.169
We have a lot of shit
we want to say about him.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.641
Do we have to keep
prefacing it with all this nice-guy stuff?

10:07.720 --> 10:09.688
I mean, if so, we're gonna be here all night.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.966
Yeah, we kind of do, though,

10:11.040 --> 10:13.202
just to offset the Denpok
of all the shitty stuff.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.803
What if we use, like, a dictionary patch?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.804
To compress all the nice-guy stuff.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.211
Like an acronym.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.327
Exactly.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.802
"Richard is great, but you know..."

10:24.880 --> 10:26.120
R-I-G-B-Y.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.326
Rig DY-

10:27.400 --> 10:30.210
Rigby is all the nice-guy stuff.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.089
Okay. Rig by-

10:32.160 --> 10:33.969
But he just assumed we were
gonna leave with him,

10:34.040 --> 10:35.769
which is kind Of total bullshit, right?

10:35.840 --> 10:36.966
That's really arrogant.

10:37.040 --> 10:41.409
Rigby, we gave up our own apps
so that we could bust our asses for him.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.721
Why the fuck should we give up
our Pied Piper shares

10:43.800 --> 10:44.961
right when we get funded,

10:45.080 --> 10:48.641
because he's too much of a prima donna
to let someone experienced come in

10:48.720 --> 10:50.927
and run the company the way
it's supposed to be run?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.206
_Rigby.
- Rigby,

10:52.280 --> 10:54.521
now I'm actually getting
kind of fucking angry.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.171
I mean, we put in so much work, for no pay,

10:57.240 --> 10:58.810
and now he thinks
he's gonna walk out on us?

10:58.880 --> 11:01.565
I mean, seriously, fuck that guy.
Fuck him. Rigby.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.364
What are we gonna do?

11:07.840 --> 11:09.080
- Rigby.
- Rigby.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.045
Richard, I have something
that might cheer you up.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.560
- What is this?
- Go on, Gloomy Gus, open it.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.406
Okay.

11:32.280 --> 11:36.729
So, this is a box of files with
companies' information on it?

11:36.840 --> 11:40.970
No. These are all companies
that I took the liberty of reaching out to

11:41.040 --> 11:45.045
that are actually offering you the job of CTO.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.121
Really?

11:46.200 --> 11:48.089
Some of these companies are pretty good.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.726
Flutterbeam's, like, really good.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.802
Of course it is. They all are.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.165
You're the belle of the ball,

11:55.240 --> 12:00.087
and these are all your swains,
hoping for a glimpse of ankle.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.882
Oh, the nest wherein the asp doth coil.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.365
Where's Richard? Is he coming?

12:12.480 --> 12:13.845
Nope.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.725
Congratulations, you've successfully
broken a good man.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.001
Is that Barker?

12:18.160 --> 12:19.366
Uh... Yeah.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.051
What are you gonna do?

12:22.120 --> 12:25.681
I just spent the last 16 hours
cherry-picking Friars <i>Roasts</i>

12:25.800 --> 12:28.121
for the premium old-man jokes.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.802
Essentially, I'm going to beat him to death
with his own titanium hips.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.008
Not just for me, but for Richard.

12:38.880 --> 12:42.521
Jack Barker, aka Action Jack.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.127
We meet at last.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.321
Erlich Bachman.

12:45.720 --> 12:49.770
Mr. Bachman. Pleasure to finally meet you.
I'm a big fan.

12:49.840 --> 12:53.322
Oh, really? Of what? Metamucil? Polio?

12:53.400 --> 12:56.210
The phonograph? A nice piece of fish?

12:56.800 --> 12:58.529
Segregated water fountains?

12:59.080 --> 13:02.243
Senior citizen discounts
at Perkins family restaurants?

13:03.200 --> 13:06.682
Erectile dysfunction because
of corroded penile arteries?

13:07.200 --> 13:09.521
Deviled eggs as an Flutterbeam's?

13:11.720 --> 13:12.767
Liking Ike?

13:12.840 --> 13:13.966
No.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.647
None of those, Mr. Bachman.
I am a fan of yours.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.088
Have been ever since
you were at the helm of Aviato.

13:23.920 --> 13:25.365
You know Aviato?

13:25.440 --> 13:27.602
Yes. Aviato.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.401
My Aviato?

13:31.080 --> 13:32.889
Is there any other Aviato?

13:33.680 --> 13:35.444
Well, legally, there cannot be.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.646
Mr. Barker, pleasure to meet you.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.165
- Is that a poppy seed muffin?
- Yes, sir.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.561
Well, Poppy wants one
'cause Mommy already got hers.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.847
Hooli stock jumped 7% today

13:44.960 --> 13:46.849
on this news that Gavin Belson
is writing down

13:46.920 --> 13:48.729
the entire Nucleus project.

13:48.800 --> 13:49.801
<i>What's happening here?</i>

13:49.880 --> 13:50.927
<i>It was a courageous move.</i>

13:51.240 --> 13:52.366
<i>He's a straight shooter,</i>

13:52.440 --> 13:54.522
<i>and obviously Wall Street
is responding to that.</i>

13:54.600 --> 13:56.045
<i>WOMAN". So, what else do you think...</i>

13:56.120 --> 13:57.963
So, by our account,

13:58.040 --> 14:00.486
just under 50% of Hooli
employment agreements

14:00.560 --> 14:02.449
include a non-compete clause.

14:02.880 --> 14:06.521
The same clause that caused us
to lose the Pied Piper lawsuit in arbitration

14:06.600 --> 14:07.840
and are thus legally invalid,

14:07.920 --> 14:10.446
calling into question
some of our IP ownership.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.407
Shit. I was afraid of that.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.848
But hypothetically,
this also presents an opportunity.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.051
Any of those people could be
dismissed with no severance.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.124
Any unvested stock
would return to the company option pool.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.444
So, in other words,
we have the right to terminate

14:26.560 --> 14:29.723
any of those people
with no repercussions whatsoever,

14:29.800 --> 14:31.928
and we'd actually make money?

14:32.280 --> 14:33.281
Correct.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.482
You know,
our annual individual performance reviews

14:37.560 --> 14:40.769
showed a 20% incidence
of sub-standard work.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.723
So, essentially, one out of
every five Hooli team members

14:44.800 --> 14:46.325
deserve to be fired.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.486
Oh, I'm sorry. What?

14:56.200 --> 14:57.884
- So, are you nervous?
- Uh...

14:58.000 --> 15:00.082
No, actually. I feel pretty good.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.164
Flutterbeam was the best company
we looked at.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.483
Their tech is great. Their offer is amazing.
Actually, I'm kind of pumped.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.404
Well, your Flutterbeam makes me pumped.

15:09.480 --> 15:10.561
You just got... Okay.

15:10.680 --> 15:11.681
- I'll do it.
- Yeah.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.811
All right. Uh, well, Jared, uh,

15:14.440 --> 15:17.284
we gotta, one day, figure out
what we're gonna do for you, for a job.

15:17.360 --> 15:22.651
Richard, you'll go. You'll establish yourself,
and when the time is right, you'll send for me.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.961
Richard, you have to talk to this man.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.364
Who, Barker? Pass.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.124
This guy is real, okay, Richard?

15:29.240 --> 15:32.449
With his managerial skills
and your talent as an engineer,

15:32.520 --> 15:34.045
we could be talking about the D-word here.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.604
- Dick?
- No. Decacorn.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.971
A company that's valued over
$10 billion before its initial public offering.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.441
All right?

15:42.520 --> 15:45.330
He's still at Raviga for another hour.
Please, go talk to him.

15:45.480 --> 15:48.643
Sorry, I can't do that.
I'm already set up at Flutterbeam.

15:48.760 --> 15:51.764
Whose CEO, unprompted, said,

15:51.840 --> 15:55.208
"A brain like Richard's
comes along once in a generation."

15:58.040 --> 15:59.724
Sorry. I'm just proud.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.562
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.967
Richard, I'm not asking you
to spoon with the guy,

16:06.040 --> 16:07.201
or even fork him.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.726
- What I'm asking for...
- What is that?

16:09.720 --> 16:12.121
Forking is when you use
your dick and your two legs

16:12.240 --> 16:13.571
to stab him in the lower torso.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.967
I'm asking for you
to take 10 minutes and talk to him

16:16.040 --> 16:18.008
before you throw everything
that we built away.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.122
And, yes, I did say "we."

16:20.760 --> 16:24.003
I mean, if you want to stop by Raviga,
it's on the way to Flutterbeam.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.530
I mean, I threw some Tyson-level
Decacorn at this guy.

16:29.600 --> 16:33.207
Richard, he didn't even flinch.
He floats like a butterfly.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.850
Hey, Richard.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.763
- What's going on?
- Um...

16:37.320 --> 16:39.129
- We've been talking.
- Okay.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.680
Guys, this isn't really a great time. Richard.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.491
Uh, we wanna tell you something. Right?

16:45.400 --> 16:46.526
Yeah, it's something important.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.284
Maybe later. So, Richard?

16:48.400 --> 16:49.481
Guys, come on.

16:50.360 --> 16:53.569
We... We know you're leaving...

16:53.640 --> 16:55.324
- Yep. Well aware.
- But“

16:57.680 --> 17:00.001
- We're not. Yeah.
- We're gonna stay at Pied Piper.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.527
Really?

17:04.800 --> 17:06.211
Why are you laughing?

17:06.280 --> 17:08.089
I'm sorry. Wow. Uh...

17:09.040 --> 17:10.405
Well, it's just that you really think

17:10.480 --> 17:13.211
that you're gonna be able to scale
the platform without me?

17:13.280 --> 17:14.486
God damn it.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.005
- Yeah.
- Oh, you don't think we can?

17:16.079 --> 17:17.366
Well, I know you can't.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.521
That's a bold statement.

17:18.640 --> 17:21.086
- Richard.
- We have massive tech debt.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.563
You really think that you can
scale and deploy my library

17:24.640 --> 17:26.243
without any input from me?

17:26.599 --> 17:27.806
Are you serious here?

17:27.880 --> 17:28.961
- Yes, we do.
- Yeah.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.805
Then I guess you are truly delusional.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.690
Well, I think you're an arrogant prick.

17:34.640 --> 17:35.721
I'm the arrogant prick.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.040
Okay. This is coming from two people

17:37.160 --> 17:39.811
who think they know everything about code
they didn't even write.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.689
We wrote a lot of the code.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.206
- You wrote some of it.
- You know what? We're gonna stay,

17:44.280 --> 17:46.647
and we're gonna build Pied Piper
just to prove you wrong.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.405
Okay. Thank you for the solidarity by the way,
and sticking with your friend.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.527
Uh, you know what, Erlich?

17:50.600 --> 17:52.329
You can tell Barker to go fuck himself,

17:52.400 --> 17:53.686
so I can go to Flutterbeam

17:53.800 --> 17:56.929
and then watch these two assholes
crash and burn

17:57.000 --> 17:59.401
trying to build out Pied Piper by themselves.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.686
This'll be great.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.730
Great timing, guys.
Thank you so much.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.165
Premium stuff, Dinesh.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.920
Richard. Richard?

18:07.200 --> 18:10.682
Well, we are now living in a post-Rigby world.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.122
Man, this place is amazing.

18:16.240 --> 18:19.005
Yeah. We raised a shit-ton of money.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.282
We're growing fast as balls.

18:21.360 --> 18:25.410
But we're not exactly super-psyched
with the quality of our engineering.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.130
Well, it's a good thing I'm here then, right?

18:27.200 --> 18:29.362
Yeah.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.289
Uh, all joking aside,
I actually have a few thoughts

18:31.360 --> 18:32.691
on your video platform if you...

18:32.760 --> 18:35.286
Oh, uh, we're pretty happy
with the basic platform.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.249
We want to hand you something way cooler.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.890
It's kind of like a secret project.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.081
I got to warn you, though. It's pretty rad.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.084
Sit right here.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.127
Okay.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.929
- All right.
- Oh, hello.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.729
This is the present.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.040
You ready to go to the future?

18:51.320 --> 18:52.287
Sure.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.641
Three, two, one.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.406
Barn!

18:57.120 --> 18:59.407
Oh. I have a mustache.

18:59.480 --> 19:00.527
Fuck yeah, you do.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.647
And check this out.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.688
Turn your head. See that?

19:03.760 --> 19:06.969
Decacorn perfect
3D holographic mustaches

19:07.080 --> 19:10.209
using depth-sensing cameras
in a live video chat.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.044
- And no one's doing it.
- Nobody.

19:12.520 --> 19:15.126
Sorry. This is the rad thing?

19:15.200 --> 19:17.931
Look, Richard, we agree, okay?
We're not there yet.

19:18.480 --> 19:20.562
We're using a crappy plug-in,
so the latency is bad.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.924
You turn too fast,
that mustache is on your ear.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.811
But with your help,
we think we can cut our 'Decacorn lag

19:25.880 --> 19:30.761
to just 20 millisecond motion-to-photon
in nine months.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.531
Just in time for Movember.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.921
So, uh, which one do you want
on your employee badge?

19:35.840 --> 19:37.171
- Tom Selleck?
- Aloha.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.441
Ooh, Fu Manchu.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.571
- John Waters.
- Not bad.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.369
- Alex Trebek. Hitler.
<i>- What is</i> a mustache?

19:42.440 --> 19:44.283
- Oh, probably not Hitler. Skip him.
- Yeah.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.203
- Bam! Sam Elliott.
- Howdy.

19:46.760 --> 19:47.886
Sure.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.007
Oh. Uh...

19:49.280 --> 19:51.521
Okay, so we've got to hop
on a call with biz Bam...

19:51.600 --> 19:54.444
- Okay.
- But feel free to keep on 'Bam. Okay?

19:55.120 --> 19:56.246
- There you go.
- All right.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.605
Oh, hey, if you want to have your attorney
look over the employment agreement

19:59.680 --> 20:02.843
and the stock option grant,
it's cool by us, all right?

20:02.920 --> 20:04.809
Just sign it. You're in.

20:04.880 --> 20:06.530
We'll see you Monday, man. We're pumped.

20:06.920 --> 20:10.891
Okay. Well, your Bam
makes me pumped.

20:25.640 --> 20:30.646
Pete Monahan, please. It's Richard Hendricks.
I just need him to go over a contract for me.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.641
What?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.571
Are you an attorney here to see a client?

20:38.640 --> 20:42.645
Uh, no. Actually I'm a client
here to see my attorney.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.330
Okay. Follow me.

20:45.680 --> 20:50.402
It began as an innocent celebration
of our arbitration victory.

20:50.680 --> 20:54.321
I ordered a Monahan,
which I did not realize contained alcohol.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.610
It was described to me
as a healthy, organic tea.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.729
Next thing I knew, I was 70 miles away,
wrapped naked in a blanket,

21:00.800 --> 21:02.450
shaking off a Monahan high,

21:02.520 --> 21:05.649
and facing charges
for attacking a police horse with a shovel.

21:07.680 --> 21:08.681
Oh.

21:08.960 --> 21:09.927
Holy shit.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.651
From a legal standpoint,
it was a clear violation of my parole,

21:12.720 --> 21:15.326
and I must now serve my entire sentence.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.447
Okay.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.251
And any additional time
stemming from the new charges,

21:19.360 --> 21:20.930
which continue to accrue.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.531
- But I'm owning my mistakes.
- Oh.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.324
I am staying positive.

21:27.760 --> 21:31.128
Enough about me.
Let's take a look at that contract.

21:31.720 --> 21:32.801
Okay. Uh...

21:35.560 --> 21:39.246
I would red-line it,
but I'm not allowed to have a pencil.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.561
Oh.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.168
This makes less sense the more I look at it.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.891
Okay. What's this number over here?

21:52.720 --> 21:55.769
I don't know.
I didn't handle the compression library.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.801
Neither did I.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.288
You're telling me Richard did this
all on his own?

22:00.560 --> 22:02.005
Shit. I thought you did it.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.642
Now I respect you even less.

22:04.760 --> 22:09.561
We each know 90% of the platform,
but it's the same 90%.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.809
Maybe that arrogant prick was right.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.086
We can't scale it without him.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.411
We are so fucked.

22:18.360 --> 22:19.646
Wait.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.930
- Yeah?
- I got it.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.528
We quit out of solidarity with Richard.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.130
That's interesting.

22:31.200 --> 22:34.409
So, even though he said
all that horrible shit to us,

22:34.480 --> 22:37.245
we take the high road and we get his back.

22:37.320 --> 22:38.446
Yeah.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.204
Maybe he'll even hire us at his new company.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.129
Flutterbeam.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.043
- Mustaches?
- Uh, yes.

22:52.120 --> 22:56.569
Doesn't necessarily have to stop at people.
They can put mustaches on their pets, too.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.971
It's, um, actually pretty fun.

22:58.040 --> 23:03.490
So, soon you'll be putting mustaches
on cats and dogs and snakes.

23:03.720 --> 23:04.721
Snakes, yeah, yeah.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.485
I mean, it's a little tricky
because they don't have a Monahan,

23:07.560 --> 23:11.804
so, finding an anchor point
for that mustache is actually

23:11.880 --> 23:14.963
gonna be quite of a technological challenge.

23:15.080 --> 23:16.570
- It's exciting stuff. It really is.
- Richard.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.880
Richard.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.845
Let me ask you something.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.325
Why you leaving Pied Piper?

23:25.200 --> 23:26.964
They pushed me out.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.685
I thought they offered you another position.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.802
Yeah, CTO. It's a demotion.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.566
Well, wouldn't you be CTO at Flutterbeam?

23:33.680 --> 23:36.490
Yes, but at least this way,
I don't have to eat shit.

23:37.520 --> 23:40.683
Richard, let me tell you
something I learned here on the inside.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.606
Swallow your pride,

23:43.680 --> 23:47.207
or soon you'll be eating
something far worse than shit.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.161
Believe me.

23:50.280 --> 23:54.001
Don't you think you should
at least meet this Barker fellow?

24:06.520 --> 24:07.521
So, where are we?

24:07.640 --> 24:13.682
1700 people slated for exiting.
Their negated options total 780,000 shares.

24:13.760 --> 24:16.969
That money can be allocated
anyway you see fit.

24:17.040 --> 24:20.169
Employee bonuses, renovations
to the day-care center,

24:20.240 --> 24:21.287
what have you.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.805
What should we prioritize?

24:26.840 --> 24:28.126
<i>Sony, I don't understand.</i>

24:29.320 --> 24:30.924
It's all in the document.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.881
Uh, you take that severance package,
and you leave Hooli immediately.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.770
But the most important aspect

24:37.840 --> 24:41.481
is the non-disclosure,
non-disparagement clause,

24:41.560 --> 24:45.690
in which you agree not to say
anything negative in the press,

24:45.800 --> 24:50.203
in public, or in private,
about Hooli or Gavin Belson.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.360
Okay, I won't.

24:53.120 --> 24:58.604
You will not discuss anything
you did at Hooli at all, in perpetuity,

24:58.680 --> 24:59.806
throughout the universe.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.641
I didn't really do anything at Hooli, so...

25:02.720 --> 25:04.927
Good. You're getting the hang of it already.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.002
So, can I keep my Hooli ID, though,

25:07.080 --> 25:09.970
so I can still come
and hang out with my friends on the roof?

25:10.320 --> 25:11.845
Uh, you cannot.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.491
Officially, you will no longer
have any friends here.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.246
Shoot

25:17.080 --> 25:19.367
I have to think about this, then.

25:19.600 --> 25:23.082
This settlement offer is quite generous.

25:23.160 --> 25:26.562
I know, I know.
I mean, $2 million is a lot of money.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.926
Two? No. It's, um...

25:30.960 --> 25:33.008
It's $20 million.

25:35.800 --> 25:36.926
20?

25:41.880 --> 25:46.807
So, they fired me before they hired you,
so, it's not your fault. I just...

25:46.880 --> 25:49.281
I feel like this can't really work.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.444
- Do you understand?
- I do, Richard.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.045
It's like, um,

25:53.120 --> 25:58.570
can I really be expected to do my best work
when I am constantly feeling undervalued

25:58.640 --> 26:00.563
at the company that I started?

26:00.640 --> 26:03.883
- Does that make sense?
-It does, Richard. Absolutely.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.804
I hear each and every one
of your concerns loud and clear,

26:06.880 --> 26:09.008
and I appreciate your position.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.081
Mmm.

26:11.240 --> 26:14.084
So, I guess we just won't do it.
Come on, I'll walk you out.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.768
Wait. What? Sorry. You what? Jack?

26:20.200 --> 26:24.410
Uh... Sorry, I don't understand.
You're not gonna take the job?

26:24.520 --> 26:25.601
Not if you're not.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.729
Without you handling the tech,
I don't see how this company works.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.243
Wow. I mean, yeah, I agree.

26:31.360 --> 26:36.287
Richard, it's hard enough running a business
when everyone is on the same page.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.408
And clearly, we are not.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.284
- Well, yeah...
- No, no, it's fine,

26:41.360 --> 26:44.011
and I appreciate you being so honest with me.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.929
I mean, better we find out now, right?

26:46.200 --> 26:47.326
Yeah.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.402
Anyway, I hope we each find
a good fit somewhere.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.361
Thanks for coming up.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.006
You got a hell of a brain there,
Richard Hendricks.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.206
You drive safe.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.527
Yeah.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.241
Shit.
