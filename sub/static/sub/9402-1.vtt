"dear lucas,

00:07.536 --> 00:09.904
"I know that I could
call you or e-mail you

00:09.955 --> 00:11.539
"or skype you or whatever,

00:11.607 --> 00:13.575
"but there's something
about putting pen to paper

00:13.626 --> 00:16.961
"that feels...Right for us.

00:17.046 --> 00:20.465
"it seems these days I have
so many thoughts in my head

00:20.549 --> 00:23.418
"that if I don't get them out,
I might explode.

00:25.304 --> 00:28.506
"I wanted you to know
that tree hill misses you,

00:28.591 --> 00:30.625
"the river court misses you...

00:30.676 --> 00:33.928
<i>And I miss you."</i>

00:39.935 --> 00:41.069
You know, I don't think

00:41.136 --> 00:42.236
You're actually supposed
to replace the stuff

00:42.304 --> 00:43.271
In your hotel room.

00:43.322 --> 00:44.355
oh, whatever.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.657
I'll be out of here soon anyway.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.909
Think I might get
a place of my own,

00:47.976 --> 00:49.611
Maybe stick around a while.

00:49.662 --> 00:51.329
Wow.

00:51.397 --> 00:53.915
Sounds kind of normal and stable.

00:53.982 --> 00:54.949
There.

00:57.286 --> 00:58.953
Perfect.

00:59.004 --> 01:01.005
Well, almost.

01:01.090 --> 01:03.458
Say you'll go out with me,
and then it will be.

01:07.963 --> 01:09.430
Okay.

01:09.498 --> 01:11.165
Yes.

01:31.904 --> 01:33.988
You know what I like
best about the movie?

01:34.039 --> 01:35.823
What's that?

01:38.494 --> 01:39.794
You get the sense

01:39.861 --> 01:42.964
That they're all gonna
live happily ever after.

01:43.031 --> 01:44.966
Hmm.

01:45.033 --> 01:47.368
They are.

02:03.736 --> 02:04.986
You okay?

02:06.772 --> 02:09.824
These aren't sad tears.
They're happy tears.

02:09.890 --> 02:11.192
All right.

02:11.243 --> 02:12.694
Well, how 'bout from now on

02:12.745 --> 02:15.446
We do smiles for happy instead?

02:18.283 --> 02:20.568
I'm pregnant.

02:22.237 --> 02:25.039
I think it's gonna be a girl.

02:26.908 --> 02:28.426
Oh, my...

02:34.016 --> 02:35.082
Nice work, daddy.

02:42.775 --> 02:43.975
Hey.

02:44.059 --> 02:45.526
Hmm?

02:47.279 --> 02:50.064
You're falling asleep.
Why don't you go to bed?

02:50.115 --> 02:51.149
Mnh-mnh.

02:51.233 --> 02:52.950
I like it here.

02:53.035 --> 02:54.635
I like it here, too.

02:54.703 --> 02:58.322
But you sleep like a rock,
and you're too long to carry.

02:58.407 --> 03:00.875
You're mean.

03:00.942 --> 03:05.329
You say I'm too long,
and you say I lose things.

03:05.397 --> 03:07.632
But I also love you.

03:07.716 --> 03:09.884
And the truth is that without you,

03:09.952 --> 03:11.619
I'd be the one who's lost.

03:13.288 --> 03:15.089
Nice save.

03:20.229 --> 03:21.512
I love you.

03:21.597 --> 03:22.847
I love you, too.

03:41.033 --> 03:42.817
Quinn!

03:42.868 --> 03:45.953
quinn!

03:46.004 --> 03:49.457
What's wrong?

03:52.427 --> 03:54.161
Are you okay?

03:54.213 --> 03:56.464
Of course. I'm fine.

03:56.515 --> 03:57.515
Come here.

03:57.599 --> 03:59.834
Baby, what happened?

03:59.885 --> 04:01.185
I, um...

04:01.270 --> 04:03.771
I just...I...

04:03.839 --> 04:06.190
I-I must have fallen asleep.

04:06.275 --> 04:08.309
you're okay?

04:08.360 --> 04:10.361
Yes, I'm fine.

04:10.445 --> 04:12.179
We're fine. Okay?

04:12.231 --> 04:13.180
I'm right here.

04:14.983 --> 04:16.399
I always will be.

04:36.054 --> 04:39.223
It's like a dream.

04:39.308 --> 04:41.893
This night.

04:41.977 --> 04:45.012
The way you look and
the way you are.

04:45.063 --> 04:46.647
My life.

04:48.383 --> 04:51.769
Tomorrow I leave for
my job in the nba.

04:51.854 --> 04:54.438
I leave this house that I own,

04:54.523 --> 04:56.357
My miracle of a son,

04:56.408 --> 04:59.110
My wife who is so far
out of my league,

04:59.194 --> 05:00.895
I hope she never figures it out.

05:00.946 --> 05:02.830
aww.

05:05.617 --> 05:08.169
Yeah, I want a
daughter just like you.

05:10.873 --> 05:14.292
I want to look into her
eyes and feel my heart break

05:14.376 --> 05:16.043
Because she reminds me so much

05:16.094 --> 05:19.096
Of her beautiful,
kind, strong mother.

05:19.181 --> 05:21.299
Mm...

05:21.383 --> 05:23.434
What if we have a boy?

05:23.518 --> 05:24.919
Then we'll sell him, try again.

05:27.589 --> 05:28.890
I missed that laugh.

05:28.941 --> 05:30.892
Aww.

05:32.277 --> 05:35.062
Are you feeling okay, baby?

05:36.815 --> 05:39.266
Are you feeling
less of that weight,

05:39.318 --> 05:41.102
That darkness?

05:44.105 --> 05:47.425
Yeah, I feel like me.

05:49.044 --> 05:51.278
And I feel like yours.

05:55.784 --> 05:57.284
That feels good.

06:16.738 --> 06:18.472
Where'd you go?

06:20.242 --> 06:24.195
I was thinking about
jamie's snow fort.

06:24.279 --> 06:26.497
Peyton and I used
to build snow forts.

06:26.581 --> 06:27.999
Mm.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.984
And we'd sit inside and worry

06:30.035 --> 06:32.653
About what our worlds
were gonna be like.

06:32.721 --> 06:34.839
It's like we'd hide from it all.

06:34.923 --> 06:37.324
But I think if we could have seen

06:37.376 --> 06:39.510
What our lives were gonna be,

06:39.594 --> 06:41.662
We wouldn't have believed it --

06:41.730 --> 06:43.981
How lucky we'd be...

06:44.049 --> 06:46.851
How lucky we are.

06:46.935 --> 06:49.553
All of us.

06:49.638 --> 06:53.457
That ring looks sexy on you.

06:53.525 --> 06:56.310
You look sexy on me.

06:56.361 --> 07:00.481
Mm.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.405
I've been thinking about this whole

07:07.489 --> 07:10.291
"we're not able to
have a baby" thing.

07:10.358 --> 07:11.859
And I was thinking
maybe we should try

07:11.910 --> 07:13.627
For a few hours.

07:13.695 --> 07:14.628
Oh.

07:14.696 --> 07:17.364
oh.

07:17.416 --> 07:20.301
And then try again
for a few more hours.

07:20.368 --> 07:21.635
Uh-huh.

07:21.703 --> 07:23.871
And then I'll wake you
up in the morning,

07:23.922 --> 07:26.257
And we can try all day tomorrow.

07:26.341 --> 07:29.844
Sounds perfect.

07:35.233 --> 07:36.684
That's good.

07:40.489 --> 07:43.024
I know you, brooke davis.

07:43.075 --> 07:44.658
You sure do.

Good man. Thank you.

08:54.173 --> 08:55.890
You know, when camp
starts tomorrow,

08:55.975 --> 08:58.209
You'll be a big part of
the reason why I'm ready.

08:58.260 --> 09:00.478
Yeah, I know.

09:00.546 --> 09:02.564
You don't seem too excited
about that, buddy.

09:02.648 --> 09:03.732
No, I am.

09:03.816 --> 09:05.734
I mean, I'm glad you're a bobcat.

09:05.818 --> 09:07.769
I just wish you
didn't have to leave.

09:07.853 --> 09:11.106
Yeah, I know, jamie.

09:11.190 --> 09:12.741
Okay. You ready?

09:12.825 --> 09:13.908
Mm-hmm.

09:16.996 --> 09:18.530
All right.

09:18.581 --> 09:21.232
Do you think the other
bobcats do this workout?

09:21.283 --> 09:23.084
I don't know, buddy. Probably not.

09:23.169 --> 09:24.235
Ohh.

09:24.286 --> 09:27.288
One more.

09:27.373 --> 09:29.040
All right. You ready? Uh-huh.

09:30.710 --> 09:32.343
Hey, so, uh, I was thinking

09:32.411 --> 09:35.130
You might want to come out on
the road with me this season.

09:35.214 --> 09:36.464
You mean with the team? Yeah.

09:36.549 --> 09:37.849
You just got to
keep your grades up,

09:37.916 --> 09:39.217
Help your out around the house

09:39.268 --> 09:40.268
Like I know you can.

09:40.352 --> 09:41.386
Oh, I will.

09:41.437 --> 09:43.354
Attaboy. Oh, and, uh...

09:43.422 --> 09:45.857
Clay said you can ride with
him to home games this year.

09:45.924 --> 09:47.275
I think you're old enough
for that, don't you?

09:47.359 --> 09:48.309
Totally. All right.

09:50.312 --> 09:52.030
Oh, and, um...

09:52.097 --> 09:54.649
I'm also gonna need you
to look after your mom

09:54.734 --> 09:56.367
While I'm gone. All right?

09:56.435 --> 09:58.369
it's just the three of you now.

09:58.437 --> 10:01.272
Well, four, actually,
if you count chester.

10:01.323 --> 10:03.625
No, three with chester.

10:03.709 --> 10:07.629
<i>Um, actually,
it's four with chester.</i>

10:07.713 --> 10:09.748
I don't get it.

10:09.799 --> 10:13.885
Well, looks like we're
gonna have another baby.

10:13.952 --> 10:14.753
Really?

10:14.804 --> 10:15.637
Yeah!

10:15.721 --> 10:17.055
Sweet!

10:17.122 --> 10:19.841
I'm totally gonna have a brother
like you and lucas, dad.

10:19.925 --> 10:21.626
or a sister.

10:21.677 --> 10:25.129
Yeah. Or that.

10:25.181 --> 10:27.849
He's your kid.

10:35.140 --> 10:36.107
Hmm.

10:40.946 --> 10:42.113
Chk. Chk.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.504
Hi.

10:51.540 --> 10:53.041
Hey.

10:54.927 --> 10:56.778
How was utah?

10:56.846 --> 10:58.513
It was -- it was good, you know?

10:58.597 --> 11:00.331
Julian's movie is really good.

11:00.399 --> 11:01.633
Good.

11:03.168 --> 11:05.053
Did you get my text?

11:05.137 --> 11:06.855
I did.

11:06.939 --> 11:09.724
I just didn't reply because...

11:09.809 --> 11:11.643
Morning, boyfriend.

11:14.563 --> 11:15.563
Oh...

11:15.648 --> 11:16.898
Hello.

11:26.242 --> 11:27.792
Whoops?

11:38.554 --> 11:40.138
Good morning, fiancÃ©.

11:40.205 --> 11:41.973
Oh, no.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.758
Not again.

11:43.843 --> 11:45.376
"not again" what?

11:45.427 --> 11:46.811
This happens all the time.

11:46.879 --> 11:49.046
I sleep with a girl,
and then the next morning,

11:49.098 --> 11:51.349
It was so amazing,
she starts planning the wedding.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.885
Be careful, mister.

11:53.936 --> 11:55.770
Speaking of, peyton says hi.

11:55.855 --> 11:57.322
Oh. Ouch. Mm-hmm.

11:59.158 --> 12:00.825
By the way, we don't
need any of this stuff

12:00.893 --> 12:03.194
Because I've been planning my
dream wedding since I was 9.

12:03.245 --> 12:04.662
Seriously?

12:04.730 --> 12:05.914
Pink-and-black color scheme,

12:05.998 --> 12:07.532
First dance
"hopelessly devoted to you,"

12:07.583 --> 12:08.616
Peonies for the flowers,

12:08.701 --> 12:09.951
And a pineapple orange torte cake.

12:12.087 --> 12:15.874
Did I mention I loved "grease 2"?

12:18.794 --> 12:21.129
I'm sorry I'm gonna have to
disappoint you, princess,

12:21.213 --> 12:22.513
<i>But this bride will be wearing</i>

12:22.581 --> 12:23.932
A clothes over bros original,

12:24.016 --> 12:26.250
The flowers will be
exotic white roses,

12:26.302 --> 12:28.019
Our first dance will not be

12:28.086 --> 12:30.855
To a song by olivia newton-john,
or elton john,

12:30.923 --> 12:32.223
Or lil' jon for that matter.

12:32.291 --> 12:33.758
But you might be able to talk me

12:33.809 --> 12:36.060
Into that orange pineappley cake,

12:36.111 --> 12:38.146
If I don't decide to
do red-velvet cupcakes,

12:38.230 --> 12:40.481
'cause that's what all the
cool kids are doing right now.

12:40.566 --> 12:41.816
Well...

12:41.901 --> 12:44.068
I should probably get another job.

12:44.119 --> 12:46.270
Here's the great thing about that.

12:46.322 --> 12:48.122
I have a few bucks
squirrelled away.

12:48.207 --> 12:49.824
I own a clothing line, you know.

12:49.909 --> 12:52.160
Clothes over bros.
You might have heard of it?

12:52.244 --> 12:54.128
<i>Oh, you're that brooke davis.</i>

12:54.213 --> 12:56.414
Like, the rich brooke davis.

12:56.465 --> 12:57.448
I am she.

12:57.499 --> 12:59.000
Oh, I chose wisely.

12:59.084 --> 13:01.619
You did indeed.

13:04.289 --> 13:07.592
I believe we have
plans for the day.

13:07.643 --> 13:09.844
I'll see you in the shower.

13:18.103 --> 13:20.137
Your scruff is tickling me.

13:22.975 --> 13:25.243
God, you smell amazing.

13:25.310 --> 13:26.978
Did I ever tell you that?

13:27.029 --> 13:29.580
And you taste good, too.

13:35.371 --> 13:36.704
<i>You taste good.</i>

13:39.708 --> 13:41.042
Mmm.

13:43.178 --> 13:45.496
This is nice.

13:45.547 --> 13:48.099
Yeah, it is.

13:49.802 --> 13:52.003
What are you thinking?

13:52.054 --> 13:54.305
I'm thinking...

13:54.356 --> 13:57.475
Your feet are enormous.

13:57.526 --> 13:59.610
Hey!

14:00.729 --> 14:02.280
How did I not notice those?

14:02.347 --> 14:03.614
You have dude feet!

14:03.682 --> 14:06.851
babe, stop!

14:06.902 --> 14:08.453
mm!

14:08.520 --> 14:09.871
Mm!

14:09.955 --> 14:11.205
Is that a phone in your pocket,

14:11.290 --> 14:12.523
Or did my feet do that to you?

14:12.574 --> 14:15.126
Actually, I left my
phone at home today.

14:15.193 --> 14:17.245
<i>You didn't bring your phone?</i>

14:17.329 --> 14:19.047
That is totally my crotch.

14:38.626 --> 14:40.494
Nice shooting, dad!

14:40.578 --> 14:42.278
Should we finish up on the road?

14:42.330 --> 14:43.613
Sure.

14:43.665 --> 14:45.716
Do madison square garden.

14:45.783 --> 14:46.950
Okay.

14:48.503 --> 14:49.803
Scott, you suck!

14:49.887 --> 14:51.287
You hear me talking over here?

14:51.339 --> 14:52.455
Yeah, you, fella.

14:52.507 --> 14:53.674
You score again,

14:53.758 --> 14:55.125
And my cousin angelo
has you whacked!

14:56.260 --> 14:58.295
Bada bing, bada boom!

14:58.363 --> 14:59.813
All right. Now do boston.

14:59.897 --> 15:01.431
Get outta the "gahden," scott!

15:01.482 --> 15:03.517
You shoulda stayed in
your cah, ya retahd.

15:03.584 --> 15:04.935
Hey!

15:04.986 --> 15:06.403
Don't say "retard."

15:06.471 --> 15:07.838
I'm just saying,

15:07.905 --> 15:09.172
I heard someone call you
that in boston last year.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.741
<i>All right, but you don't say it.</i>

15:10.808 --> 15:12.275
Los angeles.

15:15.813 --> 15:18.415
Yeah. So I was thinking sushi.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.718
Yeah. I'm at the game.

15:21.786 --> 15:24.921
Nah, I don't know the score.
I'm not even watching.

15:24.989 --> 15:27.991
Man, nicholson got wrinkly.

15:29.961 --> 15:32.162
Attaboy.

15:33.664 --> 15:36.216
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.302
Yeah. Me too.

15:39.353 --> 15:41.304
So, that baby thing --

15:41.355 --> 15:43.173
How does that work?

15:43.224 --> 15:45.358
What?

15:45.443 --> 15:48.061
Mom's gonna have a baby, right?

15:48.146 --> 15:50.647
I just wondered, you know, how?

15:52.734 --> 15:55.518
You said the basketball
hoop was like my uterus.

15:55.570 --> 15:57.554
He caught me totally off guard.

15:57.622 --> 15:58.905
He was like a ninja.

15:58.990 --> 16:00.490
Like a three-foot-tall,

16:00.541 --> 16:02.542
"where do babies come from?" ninja.

16:02.627 --> 16:04.327
Where did you leave it?

16:04.378 --> 16:06.063
Kind of uncomfortable and confused.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.147
<i>And that was just me.</i>

16:08.666 --> 16:10.700
I just started babbling about
the birds and the bees,

16:10.752 --> 16:13.470
And he was just sitting
there looking at me like,

16:13.537 --> 16:16.306
"my dad was totally my
hero until this very moment

16:16.373 --> 16:18.725
When I realize he's
actually a complete ass."

16:18.810 --> 16:19.843
Hmm.

16:19.894 --> 16:21.211
He said he was gonna talk to you.

16:21.262 --> 16:22.846
great. Thanks a lot.

16:22.897 --> 16:24.431
Yeah. Good luck with that.

16:29.320 --> 16:32.889
Hey, so I've been thinking
a lot about this, and...

16:32.940 --> 16:36.359
I think you and jamie should
come to charlotte with me.

16:36.410 --> 16:37.911
Today?

16:37.995 --> 16:39.079
This season.

16:39.163 --> 16:40.697
Okay.

16:40.748 --> 16:43.533
I'm not sure what kind
of job the boy can get

16:43.584 --> 16:44.868
With his third-grade
education, but...

16:44.919 --> 16:46.620
You can home-school him.

16:46.704 --> 16:48.905
Look, I feel bad about
the timing of this

16:48.956 --> 16:51.124
And everything with
the pregnancy and...

16:51.209 --> 16:53.093
My depression?

16:53.177 --> 16:54.744
Yeah.

17:01.219 --> 17:02.919
Listen.

17:02.970 --> 17:05.771
I'm okay. I feel better.

17:05.857 --> 17:07.523
And when I'm not, I'll tell you.

17:07.590 --> 17:09.476
You promise?

17:09.560 --> 17:11.194
I promise.

17:11.262 --> 17:12.863
Okay.

17:12.930 --> 17:14.597
Although I really
appreciate the fact

17:14.648 --> 17:17.284
That my sexy husband
doesn't want to leave home.

17:17.367 --> 17:18.819
Besides, if we go with you,

17:18.903 --> 17:21.538
You're gonna have to give
jamie the sex talk with me.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.656
That's a good point.

17:23.741 --> 17:24.657
I'll miss you.

17:24.742 --> 17:26.943
I'll talk to him.

17:28.462 --> 17:29.996
Hey, have you spoken to clay today?

17:30.081 --> 17:31.715
I've been trying to
get ahold of quinn.

17:31.782 --> 17:33.416
I want to tell her
that we're pregnant,

17:33.467 --> 17:34.968
But she's not answering her phone.

17:35.052 --> 17:36.586
Uh, actually, clay has this thing

17:36.637 --> 17:38.454
Where he didn't talk to me
the day before a road trip

17:38.506 --> 17:39.806
And I played great,

17:39.891 --> 17:42.309
So he usually blows me off
the day before I travel.

17:42.393 --> 17:43.894
Besides, did you see
those two in utah?

17:43.961 --> 17:45.478
They probably haven't
even left the bedroom.

17:45.563 --> 17:46.963
Sick.

17:47.014 --> 17:49.816
Party foul on the mental image.

17:49.901 --> 17:51.801
Although clay looks kind of hot.

17:51.853 --> 17:52.986
Watch it, you.

17:56.073 --> 17:58.825
I'll probably stop by there
on my way out of town.

17:58.910 --> 18:01.444
<i>I might have to give them "the talk,
" too.</i>

18:01.495 --> 18:03.530
Yeah, 'cause you did so
well with it the first time.

18:07.034 --> 18:08.501
Damn it.

18:09.987 --> 18:12.822
Did you find your next movie yet?!

18:12.874 --> 18:15.491
Brooke, I'm on page 3
of the first script.

18:15.543 --> 18:18.845
So, does that mean you're
gonna read all day instead?

18:18.930 --> 18:20.797
Why, what'd you have in mind?

18:25.386 --> 18:26.970
"grease 2"?

18:28.839 --> 18:30.506
Yeah. I like your idea better.

18:30.558 --> 18:32.025
Let me get my t-bird jacket.

18:36.197 --> 18:37.647
Hey!

18:37.698 --> 18:39.449
Hi!

18:39.516 --> 18:41.318
So, that's a cool jacket.

18:41.369 --> 18:42.786
What is that, "grease"?

18:42.853 --> 18:45.188
"grease 2," actually. Oh.

18:45.239 --> 18:47.157
I never saw that movie.

18:47.208 --> 18:49.409
So, what's going on?

18:49.493 --> 18:50.827
Uh...

18:50.878 --> 18:52.796
Ready for my greased lightning!

18:52.863 --> 18:53.964
Oh.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.668
Oh! Oh! Ew! Ew!

18:58.719 --> 19:00.470
Oh, my god. I'm sorry, you guys!

19:00.537 --> 19:03.056
<i>Uh, speaking of that,
I'm pregnant.</i>

19:03.140 --> 19:05.175
Don't hate me.

19:05.226 --> 19:06.176
Congratulations!

19:06.227 --> 19:07.310
Selfish baby haver.

19:08.729 --> 19:10.647
Oh...

19:13.050 --> 19:15.718
Your "greased lightning"?

19:22.326 --> 19:25.745
I'm sorry about the
"boyfriend" comment.

19:25.830 --> 19:28.865
I mean, not that I said it, but...

19:28.916 --> 19:30.450
On second thought,

19:30.518 --> 19:33.503
I guess I'm not
really sorry about it.

19:33.570 --> 19:35.538
It's fine.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.243
It's just...

19:40.311 --> 19:42.212
Mia texted me.

19:42.263 --> 19:45.415
She thinks maybe we made a mistake.

19:45.466 --> 19:47.133
Maybe we did.

19:47.218 --> 19:49.019
But the timing was
completely brutal.

19:49.086 --> 19:51.021
I mean, not the
timing of you and me,

19:51.088 --> 19:54.107
Just the timing of the...
Whole thing.

19:54.191 --> 19:55.758
I don't know.

19:58.362 --> 20:01.815
I know I like you, alex.

20:06.721 --> 20:08.872
Well, don't just sit there.

20:08.939 --> 20:10.707
Make a case for yourself.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.637
You're dirty.

20:26.173 --> 20:27.557
I like you, too.

20:27.624 --> 20:29.392
And I want to be close to you.

20:29.460 --> 20:31.794
Grubbs is on tour, right?

20:31.846 --> 20:33.763
So you need a bartender.

20:33.814 --> 20:35.682
Alex, your movie just blew up.

20:35.766 --> 20:38.101
At the festival.
But it hasn't been released yet.

20:38.152 --> 20:39.602
So it's better that I wait.

20:39.653 --> 20:41.187
Anyway, when it's a big hit,

20:41.272 --> 20:43.239
I'll have the power to shoot
my next film in north carolina,

20:43.307 --> 20:45.108
Near my new boyfriend.

20:45.159 --> 20:47.911
So what do you say, bar manager?

20:47.978 --> 20:50.813
Want to boss me around?

20:59.990 --> 21:04.127
So, you think I should take
that job in south africa?

21:04.178 --> 21:05.661
Clay?

21:05.713 --> 21:07.663
You okay?

21:07.715 --> 21:09.499
I just realized that I
haven't seen a single person

21:09.550 --> 21:10.633
On this beach the entire day.

21:10.684 --> 21:11.801
Have you?

21:11.852 --> 21:14.554
No.

21:14.638 --> 21:16.606
Do you know what that means?

21:16.673 --> 21:18.775
What?

21:20.227 --> 21:21.945
Skinnydipping.

22:03.571 --> 22:05.388
So, haley's pregnant again.

22:05.439 --> 22:08.057
Yeah. It's gonna be
really good for them.

22:08.109 --> 22:10.527
She's been so sad
since her mom died.

22:10.578 --> 22:12.028
Now they'll have a new baby.

22:12.079 --> 22:14.030
I'm really happy for her.

22:14.081 --> 22:15.615
Mm. Little selfish, though.

22:15.699 --> 22:17.083
Totally selfish.

22:17.168 --> 22:19.452
They already have jamie,
and we can't even have one.

22:19.537 --> 22:21.421
So greedy.

22:21.505 --> 22:22.738
Maybe we could kidnap this one.

22:22.790 --> 22:25.091
Or maybe you could
meet me in the bedroom,

22:25.176 --> 22:27.410
And I could romance
your ovaries some more

22:27.461 --> 22:28.744
Until they surrender.

22:28.796 --> 22:31.297
"ovaries" isn't very sexy.

22:31.382 --> 22:33.099
No. I know.

22:33.184 --> 22:35.602
I'm gonna change.

22:41.442 --> 22:45.311
At least I have pants on this time.

22:48.232 --> 22:50.033
brooke davis?

22:50.100 --> 22:53.069
I was totally joking about
the kidnapping thing.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.537
You're under arrest.

22:54.605 --> 22:55.605
What?!

22:55.656 --> 22:56.772
Wait. Why?!

22:56.824 --> 22:58.608
What did I do?!

22:58.659 --> 23:00.160
Julian!

23:00.244 --> 23:01.578
Julian!

23:12.082 --> 23:13.699
How long will it take?

23:13.783 --> 23:17.319
Geez, you scared the...
Life out of me!

23:17.370 --> 23:18.954
<i>You are like a little ninja.
Sorry.</i>

23:19.005 --> 23:21.323
Just wondered when the
baby was gonna get here.

23:21.374 --> 23:23.625
Well, that won't be for a while.

23:23.677 --> 23:27.212
Usually it takes about nine months.

23:27.297 --> 23:30.499
Your dad said you had
some questions about that.

23:30.550 --> 23:31.967
Yeah.

23:32.018 --> 23:33.969
He just babbled something about...

23:34.020 --> 23:35.971
Basketballs and eggs and stuff?

23:36.022 --> 23:37.189
<i>He said you'd explain it.</i>

23:37.273 --> 23:38.557
Oh, he did, huh?

23:38.641 --> 23:39.641
Yep.

23:45.065 --> 23:47.282
I said something about
chester falling in love.

23:47.350 --> 23:48.701
awesome.

23:48.785 --> 23:50.152
No, it's not awesome.

23:50.203 --> 23:52.988
I'm looking at my son who was born,
like, three weeks ago,

23:53.039 --> 23:54.573
And he's asking me about sex!

23:54.657 --> 23:56.858
And I have to tell him that
chester the bunny rabbit

23:56.910 --> 23:58.660
Is falling in love
and getting married.

23:58.712 --> 24:00.379
And it was just really bad.

24:00.463 --> 24:01.797
Speaking of which,

24:01.865 --> 24:03.499
Did you hear brooke and
julian got engaged?

24:03.550 --> 24:06.051
Geez. What else happened
in utah that I missed?

24:06.136 --> 24:07.152
Um...

24:07.220 --> 24:08.587
Alex and chase?

24:08.671 --> 24:10.889
Yeah. I heard about that.

24:10.974 --> 24:12.741
I'm sorry, mia.

24:12.809 --> 24:15.477
Don't be. It's my own fault.

24:15.545 --> 24:17.262
Hey, speaking of slutty,

24:17.347 --> 24:19.714
Congratulations on being pregnant.

24:19.766 --> 24:21.216
Oh, tha-- thank you. I think.

24:22.485 --> 24:23.736
Just don't ask me to
explain it to you.

24:26.222 --> 24:28.574
I know. I'm a nerd. I have to go.

24:28.658 --> 24:30.725
Okay.

24:30.777 --> 24:32.894
Hey...

24:32.946 --> 24:34.229
If I haven't said it lately,

24:34.280 --> 24:35.531
I want you to know that
it means a lot to me

24:35.582 --> 24:36.782
That you came back to
help with the label.

24:36.866 --> 24:37.950
Hales, of course.

24:38.034 --> 24:39.585
As long as you're feeling better.

24:39.669 --> 24:41.203
I am. Thanks.

24:42.756 --> 24:45.207
And good luck, by the way.

24:45.258 --> 24:46.575
Why?

24:46.626 --> 24:48.210
Alex is gross. Pick mia.

25:14.487 --> 25:16.104
Well, I assume she'll be released,

25:16.156 --> 25:17.322
But that's not the point.

25:18.941 --> 25:21.443
No, the press isn't here yet -
also not the point.

25:21.494 --> 25:23.162
The point is,
brooke's been arrested,

25:23.246 --> 25:25.380
And you're her business
partner and her mother.

25:25.448 --> 25:27.883
So you need to get
alexander's dingo

25:27.950 --> 25:29.618
Out of your wallaby and fix it.

25:29.669 --> 25:31.503
Now!

25:49.155 --> 25:50.972
You feel any pain here?

25:51.024 --> 25:52.974
No.

25:53.026 --> 25:54.443
Here?

25:54.494 --> 25:55.694
No.

25:58.865 --> 26:00.165
Is everything okay?

26:00.250 --> 26:02.417
Yeah, I just want
to run some tests.

26:10.844 --> 26:12.261
You feel any pain here?

26:12.328 --> 26:13.762
No.

26:15.798 --> 26:17.132
Here?

26:17.183 --> 26:18.166
Nope.

26:19.969 --> 26:22.554
Everything okay?

26:22.639 --> 26:25.140
I just want to run some tests.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.044
So, your mom is gonna meet you

26:46.112 --> 26:47.613
At the store with millicent,

26:47.680 --> 26:50.031
And your attorney
should be there shortly.

26:50.083 --> 26:52.534
Is there anything I can do?

26:56.973 --> 27:00.008
You're doing it right now.

27:04.681 --> 27:07.182
Just take me to the store.

27:20.580 --> 27:23.615
Well, just have him call
us the minute he lands,

27:23.700 --> 27:26.251
And do not speak to
anyone else. Okay?

27:26.336 --> 27:29.204
Do you -- yeah. Well, I have to go.

27:29.255 --> 27:30.289
Honey.

27:30.373 --> 27:31.290
Don't!

27:36.245 --> 27:39.131
Before you say another word,

27:39.215 --> 27:41.082
You should both know

27:41.134 --> 27:43.385
That I have just come
from the city jail,

27:43.436 --> 27:44.803
Where I was frisked

27:44.887 --> 27:48.807
<i>By a large supposedly female cop</i>

27:48.891 --> 27:52.945
<i>Who was very thorough in
her cavity search.</i>

27:53.029 --> 27:55.781
<i>Now speak.</i>

27:55.865 --> 27:57.599
Honey, it's not that bad.

27:57.650 --> 27:59.768
Not that bad?

27:59.819 --> 28:02.270
Not that bad?!

28:02.322 --> 28:04.790
I was just arrested...

28:04.874 --> 28:09.328
And...Explored by a
woman with a mustache

28:09.412 --> 28:10.996
And man hands!

28:11.080 --> 28:13.498
When you look up "bad"
in the dictionary,

28:13.583 --> 28:15.083
<i>This is it!</i>

28:15.134 --> 28:17.002
I had her.

28:18.388 --> 28:21.640
Man hands.

28:21.724 --> 28:23.058
You're being dramatic.

28:23.125 --> 28:24.176
Oh, yes.

28:24.260 --> 28:25.927
I sure as hell am being dramatic,

28:25.979 --> 28:27.846
Because there are three people

28:27.930 --> 28:29.348
Who run this company --

28:29.415 --> 28:31.966
Actually, two, lately.

28:32.018 --> 28:34.135
<i>What is that supposed to mean?</i>

28:34.187 --> 28:36.188
<i>It means that you have
been a little...</i>

28:36.272 --> 28:38.073
Absentee of late.

28:38.140 --> 28:42.411
<i>And you've been a little slutty of late,
old woman,</i>

28:42.478 --> 28:44.997
Getting railed by alexander.

28:45.081 --> 28:46.648
Maybe we should all just calm down.

28:46.699 --> 28:48.200
Great idea, millie.

28:48.284 --> 28:49.534
Do you have any cocaine
we could snort?!

28:49.619 --> 28:51.019
That's not fair.

28:51.087 --> 28:52.254
<i>Well, when you get arrested,</i>

28:52.321 --> 28:54.539
<i>You can stop playing fair.</i>

28:54.624 --> 28:57.676
I am being charged
with accounting fraud,

28:57.760 --> 29:00.328
Financial misrepresentation --

29:00.380 --> 29:02.764
<i>What are they talking about?</i>

29:02.832 --> 29:03.932
They're saying that we lied

29:03.999 --> 29:05.017
To our investors about our profit.

29:05.101 --> 29:06.385
Did we?

29:06.469 --> 29:07.602
Brooke --

29:07.670 --> 29:08.854
Don't speak.

29:08.938 --> 29:10.672
<i>You're not the boss of me.</i>

29:10.723 --> 29:13.675
Which, let's face it,
is completely ridiculous!

29:13.726 --> 29:15.310
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

29:15.361 --> 29:16.728
It means we have a
half-ass assistant

29:16.813 --> 29:18.313
And part-time model

29:18.364 --> 29:20.065
Running a
multimillion-dollar company!

29:20.149 --> 29:21.850
And zero is a size, by the way.

29:21.901 --> 29:24.036
And 50 is an age, by the way.

29:26.856 --> 29:29.624
<i>I am not 50.</i>

29:29.692 --> 29:31.993
Okay, stop!

29:32.045 --> 29:33.879
Both of you.

29:33.963 --> 29:35.797
I am barely 40.

29:35.865 --> 29:37.416
And I'm only a 2.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.583
Stop!

29:40.503 --> 29:42.704
These charges.

29:42.755 --> 29:46.091
Lying to our investors --

29:46.175 --> 29:49.561
Tell me we can fix this.

29:49.645 --> 29:51.763
Tell me that we can prove

29:51.848 --> 29:55.216
That this is a mistake.

29:55.268 --> 29:56.568
Honey, listen to me.

29:56.652 --> 29:59.604
No. It's not a mistake.

30:11.952 --> 30:14.086
I can't believe your
parents talked to you

30:14.154 --> 30:15.671
About the s-e-x.

30:15.756 --> 30:16.822
That's so cool!

30:16.873 --> 30:18.758
Tell me again what they said.

30:18.825 --> 30:19.992
I told you --

30:20.043 --> 30:21.660
Just a bunch of stuff
that didn't make sense.

30:21.712 --> 30:23.596
Well, maybe we can find
it on the internet.

30:23.663 --> 30:25.214
I tried.

30:25.299 --> 30:26.882
Uh, yeah.

30:26.967 --> 30:29.218
<i>That was before I disabled your
parent-protection settings.</i>

30:29.303 --> 30:31.387
Dude, no. You have
to put that back!

30:31.471 --> 30:33.356
<i>It's no big deal.
It is a big deal!</i>

30:33.440 --> 30:35.358
I'm not supposed to mess
with that. I promised!

30:35.442 --> 30:38.010
You want to find out where
babies come from or not?

30:39.613 --> 30:40.613
Move.

30:43.283 --> 30:47.119
Okay, I guess I'll type in "mom"?

30:47.187 --> 30:50.239
No. "lady"...

30:50.307 --> 30:51.874
And "rabbit"?

30:51.958 --> 30:53.909
Ooh, put "sex" in there, too!

31:00.300 --> 31:02.368
<i>Ew! What the heck is that?!</i>

31:02.419 --> 31:04.337
Hey, my mom has one of those!

31:05.806 --> 31:06.806
Okay, chuck --

31:06.873 --> 31:08.540
I didn't do it! I don't like it!

31:20.220 --> 31:22.071
Did you have sex with her?

31:22.155 --> 31:24.523
it wasn't like that.

31:24.574 --> 31:26.592
I don't even know why I asked that.

31:26.660 --> 31:28.294
It doesn't matter.

31:28.362 --> 31:29.412
<i>It does matter.</i>

31:29.496 --> 31:30.946
But it wasn't like that.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.749
But you like her.

31:33.834 --> 31:35.951
Mia, you broke up with
me by text message.

31:36.036 --> 31:37.670
<i>And then I tried to fix it.</i>

31:37.737 --> 31:39.188
By text message.

31:40.957 --> 31:44.343
Yeah, but you were in utah, and...

31:44.411 --> 31:48.064
Nobody talks on the phone anymore.

31:48.131 --> 31:50.266
Well

31:50.350 --> 31:52.635
I'm sorry, you know?

31:52.719 --> 31:54.520
It's just...

31:54.587 --> 31:56.939
Alex asked me out in person.

31:59.676 --> 32:01.527
And what'd you say?

32:04.064 --> 32:05.597
I said yes.

32:12.239 --> 32:14.073
I said no.

32:14.124 --> 32:15.624
Just so you know,

32:15.709 --> 32:18.377
When chuck wanted to
mess with the computer,

32:18.445 --> 32:20.045
I said no.

32:20.113 --> 32:21.947
But you did it anyway.

32:24.634 --> 32:27.286
Two weeks. No computer,
no cellphone.

32:27.337 --> 32:28.620
But, dad --

32:28.672 --> 32:29.788
We can make it three.

32:34.010 --> 32:36.262
<i>This is not about your
being curious.</i>

32:36.313 --> 32:38.564
Being curious is okay.

32:38.631 --> 32:39.682
It's just about your computer

32:39.766 --> 32:40.632
And the promise that you broke.

32:40.684 --> 32:41.767
Do you understand that?

32:43.437 --> 32:46.472
I just don't understand about...

32:46.540 --> 32:50.609
Rabbits and bees and
eggs and basketballs.

32:55.148 --> 32:58.000
Okay, here's the thing,
buddy. Um...

32:58.068 --> 33:00.553
It's my last day home before camp.

33:00.620 --> 33:01.871
So we can either talk about this,

33:01.955 --> 33:03.822
Or we can play the new
"gears of war" game

33:03.874 --> 33:04.840
I got you as a going-away gift.

33:04.908 --> 33:05.841
It's in your room.

33:05.926 --> 33:07.543
Sweet!

33:07.627 --> 33:09.712
I'm sorry.

33:09.796 --> 33:11.630
Jam--

33:13.099 --> 33:16.018
What? That is gonna buy
us at least another year.

33:16.102 --> 33:17.603
Make war, not love, babe.

33:17.670 --> 33:19.104
Oh ho ho.

33:19.172 --> 33:20.306
Pushing your luck.

33:31.518 --> 33:33.953
I said no.

33:36.823 --> 33:39.191
Just so you know...

33:39.242 --> 33:41.627
When I figured out what
victoria was doing,

33:41.694 --> 33:42.962
I said no.

33:43.029 --> 33:45.664
But you did it anyway.

33:45.715 --> 33:48.000
You know how she is.

33:48.051 --> 33:50.970
Oh, she's always been that way.

33:54.424 --> 33:57.042
We have a meeting with our
attorney this afternoon.

33:57.093 --> 33:58.761
Why did you do it?

33:58.845 --> 34:00.980
<i>Why did she do it?</i>

34:01.047 --> 34:05.100
Lie about our profits?

34:07.938 --> 34:11.389
We needed investors
for the men's line.

34:11.440 --> 34:14.360
We believed in the line,
and we wanted to launch it,

34:14.411 --> 34:18.563
But...The economy never rebounded.

34:18.614 --> 34:21.449
So we lied to investors

34:21.534 --> 34:23.786
And told them we were more
profitable than we are.

34:28.041 --> 34:30.226
Victoria thinks she can fix it.

34:30.310 --> 34:32.594
She's wrong.

34:32.679 --> 34:36.214
Once a company's financial
integrity is challenged,

34:36.266 --> 34:38.900
It's...Over.

34:42.022 --> 34:44.072
Integrity.

34:46.092 --> 34:49.178
You remember this?

34:49.246 --> 34:51.964
That was my first
sale in tree hill.

34:52.032 --> 34:54.800
You wrote that check
to spite victoria.

34:54.868 --> 34:57.786
That day.

35:00.423 --> 35:03.259
it's amazing...

35:03.343 --> 35:04.843
How far we've fallen.

35:17.163 --> 35:18.864
I never asked you about the doctor.

35:18.915 --> 35:20.065
How'd it go?

35:20.116 --> 35:21.834
Oh, um, great.

35:21.901 --> 35:23.536
Everything's fine. You?

35:23.587 --> 35:25.971
Same. Everything's fine.

35:26.039 --> 35:27.790
You ready to go?

35:29.009 --> 35:30.409
Yeah.

35:30.460 --> 35:32.761
I thought I'd stop by clay's
on the way out of town,

35:32.846 --> 35:34.580
Tell quinn to call you. Thanks.

35:34.631 --> 35:36.348
I also maybe threw
your things in the car.

35:36.416 --> 35:37.766
Jamie's too.

35:37.851 --> 35:39.218
Thought I could make
you change your mind.

35:39.269 --> 35:42.021
I wish.

35:42.088 --> 35:44.306
We're gonna miss yo.

35:44.391 --> 35:46.258
Yeah.

35:46.309 --> 35:48.260
About that.

35:48.311 --> 35:49.595
We have money.

35:49.646 --> 35:51.697
You have time.

35:51.764 --> 35:54.483
Stash the kid with
brooke and get my baby,

35:54.568 --> 35:56.368
And my other baby,

35:56.436 --> 35:58.770
To charlotte as much as possible.

35:58.822 --> 36:00.990
Promise me.

36:01.074 --> 36:02.241
I promise. Cross my heart.

36:02.292 --> 36:03.775
All right.

36:03.827 --> 36:05.160
Don't make me ground you. No.

36:05.245 --> 36:06.579
You've seen how I lower the hammer.

36:06.630 --> 36:07.746
I don't mess around.

36:07.797 --> 36:09.448
I have. It's pretty scary.

36:09.499 --> 36:10.499
Come here.

36:13.336 --> 36:14.786
Mmm.

36:14.838 --> 36:16.388
I love you.

36:16.456 --> 36:18.891
I'm in love with you.

36:18.958 --> 36:21.644
It's nice after all this time.

36:21.728 --> 36:24.847
It's everything
after all this time.

36:24.931 --> 36:29.184
Yeah.

36:36.526 --> 36:37.576
Cocktail mixer.

36:37.644 --> 36:39.078
Okay.

36:39.145 --> 36:41.280
See that? One more time.

36:41.331 --> 36:43.315
Boom. okay.

36:43.366 --> 36:45.651
One more time.

36:47.203 --> 36:48.370
Okay.

36:48.438 --> 36:49.204
Got it? Yeah.

36:50.540 --> 36:51.674
you got it.

36:51.758 --> 36:53.042
Ah... There we go.

36:53.126 --> 36:54.593
No!

36:54.661 --> 36:55.461
oh!

37:56.606 --> 37:59.491
Can I help you?

37:59.559 --> 38:00.993
Hey. I...

38:01.060 --> 38:02.561
I just...

38:02.612 --> 38:04.913
I-I know you have a
history with chase,

38:04.998 --> 38:07.249
And I hope that there's
no hard feelings.

38:07.333 --> 38:09.034
It must've been a surprise --

38:09.085 --> 38:10.502
Me and chase.

38:10.570 --> 38:11.870
No, not really.

38:11.921 --> 38:15.107
It's what you do,
right? Break up couples?

38:16.543 --> 38:18.010
Yeah.

38:18.077 --> 38:19.428
It kind of is.

38:19.512 --> 38:21.246
But not this time.

38:21.297 --> 38:24.299
You screwed this up all
by yourself, didn't you?

38:24.384 --> 38:27.419
You can go now.

38:27.470 --> 38:29.471
By the way,

38:29.556 --> 38:31.640
I plan to make him happier
than you ever did,

38:31.725 --> 38:33.759
So you should probably just
give up and move on now.

38:33.810 --> 38:35.894
Okay? Great.

38:35.945 --> 38:37.312
<i>Now I can go.</i>

38:53.613 --> 38:56.915
Everything's gone.

38:56.966 --> 38:58.450
I'm not.

39:10.096 --> 39:11.680
I dreamt that I lost you.

39:13.733 --> 39:17.352
You went to bed, and...

39:17.437 --> 39:19.688
Something terrible happened.

39:19.773 --> 39:22.441
And I couldn't save you.

39:22.492 --> 39:24.610
Why didn't you tell me?

39:24.661 --> 39:26.779
Because...

39:26.830 --> 39:29.414
I didn't want to ruin today.

39:29.482 --> 39:31.700
You didn't.

39:31.785 --> 39:34.036
Today was perfect.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.537
I'm glad.

39:40.977 --> 39:43.462
What do you say, you, uh...

39:43.513 --> 39:45.881
Get dressed and let me watch?

39:47.333 --> 39:48.884
I can do that.
