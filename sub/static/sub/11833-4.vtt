00:00.801 --> 00:02.302
<i>Previously on "The Practice"...</i>

00:02.335 --> 00:03.804
Is something wrong,
Ellenor?

00:03.836 --> 00:05.371
You came to kill me?

00:05.405 --> 00:08.007
You know how many times
you've killed me?

00:08.675 --> 00:10.243
Bad boyfriend!

00:10.276 --> 00:11.377
No!

00:19.252 --> 00:21.321
Senator Potanki's
assault trial --

00:21.354 --> 00:23.423
I'd like you
to second-chair.

00:23.456 --> 00:26.560
That trial started yesterday.
I saw it on the news.

00:26.593 --> 00:29.095
If all goes according to plan,
it'll be over by Thursday.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.597
You won't have to do
a damn thing.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.732
Bobby, who is he?

00:32.766 --> 00:34.200
What?

00:34.234 --> 00:37.370
The witness --
who the hell is he?

00:37.403 --> 00:39.172
He forgot who that
witness was, didn't he?

00:39.205 --> 00:41.107
You could tell?

00:41.141 --> 00:43.309
Only because
he clenched his hands.

00:43.343 --> 00:46.212
Has this been going on
since the stroke?

00:46.246 --> 00:47.548
Joanne told me.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.282
You go to the judge,
and you tell him that

00:49.315 --> 00:52.385
I've forgotten the facts in
this case, and I'm finished.

00:52.418 --> 00:54.154
The fall is coming.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.289
He is only going
to listen to you.

00:56.322 --> 00:59.526
It's time, Ray.
It's time to quit.

01:12.338 --> 01:14.841
You're Raymond Oz,
aren't you?

01:14.875 --> 01:18.344
That I am.

01:19.746 --> 01:23.316
Wow. You know,
I've always Dreamed

01:23.349 --> 01:24.551
of being
on opposite benches --

01:24.585 --> 01:26.186
you and me,

01:26.219 --> 01:28.188
but in a courtroom,
not a hallway.

01:28.221 --> 01:29.322
Are you a lawyer?

01:29.355 --> 01:30.757
Harland Bassett.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.326
I can't say I've argued
before the supreme court, but --

01:33.359 --> 01:35.762
plenty of time.
What are you, about 65?

01:35.796 --> 01:38.198
53. Do I look 65?

01:38.231 --> 01:40.200
Oh, I'm just
a crazy old man.

01:40.233 --> 01:43.570
Appearances
mean nothing to me.

01:43.604 --> 01:47.340
You know, you and I
enjoy reputations.

01:47.373 --> 01:50.476
You're considered
one of the greatest lawyers

01:50.511 --> 01:52.478
in the history
of the commonwealth,

01:52.513 --> 01:55.481
and me -- I might be
thought of as one of the worst.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.851
Yeah, well, reputations
can change in a heartbeat.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.886
What are you, 62, 63?

01:59.920 --> 02:03.223
53.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.892
Raymond.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.428
Bobby, I need
to talk to you.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.631
It's important.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.265
What's up?

02:12.298 --> 02:14.434
Well, unfortunately,
Bobby,

02:14.467 --> 02:17.270
I need your legal help.

02:17.303 --> 02:20.273
Uh...

02:20.306 --> 02:23.644
This isn't easy.
It's about Joanne.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.711
How do you mean?

02:24.745 --> 02:27.280
You know we've had
our disagreements in the past,

02:27.313 --> 02:30.283
but lately, her behavior
has become outrageous.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.653
First,
it was just receipts

02:32.686 --> 02:34.655
stuffed
in the kitchen drawers.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.791
Then she began to disappear
for hours on end,

02:37.824 --> 02:40.393
and when I asked her
where she'd been,

02:40.426 --> 02:41.795
she got angry,

02:41.828 --> 02:44.631
and then one day,

02:44.665 --> 02:49.302
she came home smelling...

02:49.335 --> 02:51.738
Smelling like
she'd been with a man.

02:51.772 --> 02:55.208
She denied it, of course,

02:55.241 --> 02:57.944
and said that I-I was
out of my mind.

02:57.978 --> 03:01.314
Ray, I can't imagine Joanne
having an affair at her age.

03:01.347 --> 03:04.585
Now, damn it, don't you
go against me, too!

03:04.618 --> 03:05.852
Let me finish!

03:08.254 --> 03:10.290
I'm sorry.

03:10.323 --> 03:13.226
What can we do for you?

03:13.259 --> 03:16.396
She's taking me to court.

03:16.429 --> 03:17.664
She wants a divorce?

03:17.698 --> 03:18.832
No, no, she's too smart
for that.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.967
No, she wants to be named
my conservator.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.403
She wants to get control
of my money,

03:23.436 --> 03:25.839
my estate, everything --
everything.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.643
Well, she's probably got a guy
stashed in some motel,

03:29.676 --> 03:30.911
playing me for a fool.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.991
All right, Ray,
easy. Easy.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.852
Now, I could
represent myself,

03:38.885 --> 03:42.488
but I need
independent counsel,

03:43.356 --> 03:45.325
someone I can trust.

03:45.358 --> 03:46.893
Let me talk to Joanne.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.895
No, there's no talking
to her.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.765
No, there's a hearing
scheduled for 9:30 this morning.

03:53.900 --> 03:58.004
I hate having to ask.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.640
I'll be there.

04:10.050 --> 04:13.253
â™ª

04:57.564 --> 04:58.932
I don't know how long
this will take.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.634
I'll call in as soon
as I have a better idea.

05:00.667 --> 05:01.702
Bobby, you still have
Harland Bassett waiting.

05:01.735 --> 05:02.903
He's in the hallway.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.538
-Oh, god. I forgot.
-We should get going.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.039
Come on.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.475
Harland,
sorry for the wait.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.944
Oh, it's all right.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.946
What can I do for you?

05:12.979 --> 05:13.914
I got a lewd and lascivious

05:13.947 --> 05:15.649
scheduled for trial
this morning -- bogus.

05:15.682 --> 05:16.917
He's a good kid.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.752
It's an easy N. G.,
uh, but judge Hiller,

05:18.785 --> 05:20.654
she's ordered me
to get co-counsel.

05:20.687 --> 05:21.755
Why?

05:21.788 --> 05:22.923
I don't know.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.390
She's got some bug
up her ass about me.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.392
What was her legal reasoning,
Harland?

05:26.426 --> 05:28.995
Uh, something about how
I've never won a trial.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.597
You've never won a trial?

05:31.431 --> 05:33.499
A lawyer can only play the cards
he's dealt.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.801
-Never?
-Lyndsay.

05:35.101 --> 05:36.369
I got a winner here,
Bobby.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.004
And you guys got
a good record

05:38.038 --> 05:39.105
with judge Hiller.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.641
It's a 2-day trial, tops.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.476
It's a guaranteed N. G.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.712
Please?

05:45.746 --> 05:46.913
-Not a chance!
-No way.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.715
I told him
I'd help him out.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.716
-Go ahead.
-Exactly.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.651
All right, quiet. Rebecca.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.586
No. I do not need
that kind of experience.

05:52.619 --> 05:53.754
I've seen that man
in court.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.121
Bobby, it's bad for us

05:55.155 --> 05:56.557
to even be associated
with Harland Bassett.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.591
He's a nice guy.

05:57.624 --> 05:58.725
And the world's
worst attorney.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.661
Lucy, straws.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.462
-I ain't Drawing straws.
-I'm too busy anyways.

06:02.495 --> 06:03.930
Why can't we put this
to a partnership vote?

06:03.964 --> 06:05.666
It's a 2-day trial at most.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.867
I'd do it myself,

06:06.900 --> 06:08.569
but I promised
to help Raymond Oz.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.136
Pick them.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.138
Luck,
be a long straw tonight.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.675
I hate this.
Uh, uh, uh.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.042
Damn! 50 bucks.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.611
Not enough!

06:17.644 --> 06:19.546
Look, I do not want to be
in court with that man.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.481
-Thanks, Eugene. I owe you one.
-You got that right.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.749
He's really
never won a case ever?

06:22.783 --> 06:23.817
And he never will.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.118
But with you
at his side...

06:25.151 --> 06:26.753
Oh, knock them dead!

06:26.787 --> 06:29.890
Hey, you might want
to keep this for next time.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.959
Thank you all very much.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.896
Maybe you should have
picked him up.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.564
He wouldn't let me.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.602
Joanne.

06:41.635 --> 06:45.071
Oh, Bobby, how are you?

06:46.840 --> 06:48.041
Hello, Mrs. Oz.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.610
Lindsay dole -- I co-chaired

06:49.643 --> 06:50.777
your husband's last case
with Bobby.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.513
Yes, of course.
I remember.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.980
Abby Smythe,
Forte and Kramer.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.650
Uh, Joanne, I just thought
we might be able

06:56.683 --> 06:59.152
to keep this
in the family.

06:59.185 --> 07:00.787
-We should go inside.
-I'm concerned, too,

07:00.821 --> 07:02.656
but is this really
the way to handle it?

07:02.689 --> 07:04.925
I don't have
a choice, Bobby.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.527
The bank calls every week

07:06.560 --> 07:08.729
and the creditors
and the accountants.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.731
How can they keep covering

07:10.764 --> 07:13.934
for his wild spending
and his -- his craziness?

07:13.967 --> 07:16.202
But having him
declared incompetent?

07:16.236 --> 07:18.572
You looked me in the eye
two years ago

07:18.605 --> 07:20.541
and told me to step in.

07:20.574 --> 07:23.176
That was about getting him
to stop practicing law.

07:23.209 --> 07:24.578
This is about competency.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.913
I can't control him
anymore.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.949
Control me?

07:28.982 --> 07:32.686
I don't need you
to control me.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.688
Ray, can we just
find someplace

07:34.721 --> 07:36.957
where we can sit down
and talk?

07:36.990 --> 07:40.694
The session starts
in four minutes, counselor.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.164
Joanne.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.204
I did not expose myself
to that woman.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.606
All right, Marvin.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.974
I just wanted you
to meet Mr. Young

07:54.007 --> 07:55.876
because he'll be helping you
with your trial.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.144
If you need help,
what am I paying you for?

07:58.178 --> 08:00.781
God, this whole thing
is a joke.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.748
Mr. Blaylock,
this isn't a joke.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.984
Your charge carries
a 3-year sentence, so --

08:04.017 --> 08:05.085
what about my ace
in the hole?

08:05.118 --> 08:06.186
Excuse me?

08:06.219 --> 08:09.990
I hadn't broached that subject
with Mr. Young yet.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.126
There's a evidentiary matter
that's not apparent

08:13.159 --> 08:14.595
from the reports.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.796
What evidentiary matter?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.531
It establishes that Marvin

08:17.564 --> 08:20.266
couldn't possibly
be the perpetrator.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.735
That's what I'm saying.

08:21.768 --> 08:22.769
Well, I looked
through the file,

08:22.803 --> 08:24.237
and I didn't see any
affirmative defense filed.

08:24.270 --> 08:27.040
That's because it's not
an affirmative defense.

08:27.073 --> 08:29.242
It's a physical impossibility.

08:29.275 --> 08:31.545
So what are we talking
about here, impotence?

08:31.578 --> 08:32.879
Hardly.

08:33.928 --> 08:39.315
Marvin has an unusual
physical characteristic

08:39.953 --> 08:44.725
that is inconsistent
with the victim's description.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.293
And are you going
to tell me what it is?

08:47.327 --> 08:50.096
Let me put it this way.
You've heard of hung juries?

08:50.130 --> 08:52.098
Yes.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.536
Well, we've got ourselves
a hung defendant.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.047
Ellenor.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.683
Mike.

09:09.716 --> 09:10.851
How are you doing?

09:10.884 --> 09:12.686
I'm okay.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.054
What's up?

09:14.087 --> 09:16.056
Well, you mind telling me
where you got the gun

09:16.089 --> 09:17.758
you used to shoot
George Vogeiman?

09:17.791 --> 09:21.227
Helen shot him.
Mine had blanks.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.129
Yes, I know, and Helen
had a permit for hers.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.130
Did you?

09:24.164 --> 09:28.669
Well, you're here
because you know I didn't.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.070
You here to arrest me?

09:30.103 --> 09:31.972
I'm here to --

09:32.005 --> 09:33.073
because I would
just love that.

09:33.106 --> 09:33.874
Ellenor --

09:33.907 --> 09:35.776
No. You talk about
your test case?

09:35.809 --> 09:37.778
I used that gun
to defend myself in my home,

09:37.811 --> 09:39.613
so go ahead
and press charges.

09:39.646 --> 09:42.683
-Ellenor --
-Are you here to arrest me?

09:42.716 --> 09:44.951
I'll tell you this --
don't dare me.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.352
I am daring you.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.254
That's exactly
what I'm doing.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.956
Ellenor, cut it out.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.357
I came here prepared
to give you a break

09:51.391 --> 09:52.358
and tell you only
that you wouldn't be

09:52.392 --> 09:53.326
getting the gun back,

09:53.359 --> 09:54.961
but don't get
on any high horse, Ellenor.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.229
For every gun used
in self-defense,

09:56.262 --> 09:58.164
40 more are used
to commit murder,

09:58.198 --> 10:00.634
and the only reason you're not
dead yourself right now

10:00.667 --> 10:02.268
is because your friend George

10:02.302 --> 10:05.071
preferred to play with knives
more than he did pistols,

10:05.105 --> 10:07.007
and don't make me out
the world's biggest idiot.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.709
The psycho killer
who stabbed Lindsay?

10:08.742 --> 10:10.711
You brought him
to the party.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.246
He was under your nose
the whole time,

10:13.279 --> 10:15.381
and you couldn't see it.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.255
I love my husband,

10:22.288 --> 10:24.290
but I can't rely
upon him anymore.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.993
A few years ago,
he had a stroke,

10:27.027 --> 10:29.395
and he just won't admit
that he's getting worse.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.397
ABBY: can you
give us examples?

10:31.431 --> 10:34.200
He runs up enormous bills
on our credit cards,

10:34.234 --> 10:36.670
and then he accuses me
of doing it.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.672
Last week
he gave our housekeeper

10:38.705 --> 10:40.741
a diamond necklace
he bought for me

10:40.774 --> 10:42.275
for our 40th anniversary.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.010
Anything else?

10:44.044 --> 10:45.946
Just the other day
I came home

10:45.979 --> 10:47.948
and found
the refrigerator filled

10:47.981 --> 10:50.316
with 15 pounds
of lunch meat

10:50.350 --> 10:52.285
for the two of us.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.788
Mrs. Oz, have you consulted
your husband's physician?

10:54.821 --> 10:56.690
No. He won't see a doctor.

10:56.723 --> 10:59.025
He thinks that they're all out
to get even with him

10:59.059 --> 11:01.962
because he won
a few malpractice suits,

11:01.995 --> 11:05.899
and he's accusing me of...

11:05.932 --> 11:08.434
He's accusing you
of what, Mrs. Oz?

11:08.468 --> 11:12.172
Of having an affair.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.907
It's so ridiculous.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.442
It's true.
You know it's true!

11:16.476 --> 11:19.212
Mr. Oz, please be seated.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.917
And now he's threatening
to give away his estate

11:23.950 --> 11:27.320
so that when he dies,
I'll be left with nothing --

11:27.353 --> 11:29.690
his revenge, he says.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.160
And he calls me a whore.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.929
BOBBY: Ray!
Tell the truth!

11:35.962 --> 11:37.798
JUDGE: Mr. Oz.
RAYMOND: You betrayed me!

11:37.831 --> 11:39.499
-Mr. Oz!
-Raymond, sit.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.167
You betrayed me.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.736
Raymond!

11:42.769 --> 11:46.907
I-I told the judge

11:46.940 --> 11:50.343
that Raymond should stop
practicing law,

11:50.376 --> 11:55.481
but he's just never
forgiven me for it.

12:04.525 --> 12:07.493
Mrs. Oz, who pays the bills
in your household?

12:07.528 --> 12:09.062
My husband.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.330
Are your utilities
paid up to date?

12:10.363 --> 12:11.231
Yes.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.233
Credit cards paid
in a timely fashion?

12:13.266 --> 12:16.169
Not always,
but most of the time.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.171
Has your husband
ever missed a payment

12:18.204 --> 12:20.006
on his insurance or any other
financial obligation?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.174
No.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.076
And has he actually
changed his will

12:23.109 --> 12:24.344
in the last two years?

12:24.377 --> 12:26.980
Well, no,
but he's threatened --

12:27.013 --> 12:30.450
the question is,
has he changed it?

12:30.483 --> 12:32.118
No.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.120
And you said
it was you

12:34.154 --> 12:36.122
who told the judge
it was time

12:36.156 --> 12:38.291
for your husband
to stop practicing law.

12:38.324 --> 12:39.359
Yes.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.294
And he's never
forgiven you for it.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.129
No, I don't believe he has.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.198
You talk of threats
and revenge

12:45.231 --> 12:47.000
and not being forgiven.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.302
That isn't incompetence,
is it, Joanne?

12:49.335 --> 12:50.571
That's anger.

12:50.604 --> 12:53.273
Bobby, what are you
trying to do?

12:53.306 --> 12:55.008
I'd ask that the witness

12:55.041 --> 12:57.010
be instructed
to answer the question.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.845
If you love him
as much as you --

12:58.879 --> 13:00.313
ask that the witness
be instructed

13:00.346 --> 13:01.582
to answer the question.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.049
All right.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.819
Please answer the question.

13:07.187 --> 13:11.357
Yes, he's angry.
He's a very angry man.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.061
I interviewed
the complaining witness

13:15.095 --> 13:16.429
who said the man
had exposed himself to her.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.498
Was Ms. Cosgrove able
to give you information

13:18.532 --> 13:20.233
about the perpetrator?

13:20.266 --> 13:22.435
Yes. She was able to give me
a detailed description.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.070
Did you arrest anyone
at that time?

13:24.104 --> 13:26.039
No. We were unable
to locate the suspect.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.440
Then about a month later,

13:27.473 --> 13:29.409
we received a phone call
from Ms. Cosgrove.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.044
She sounded extremely upset

13:31.077 --> 13:32.445
and told me that she
had just seen the man.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.180
We proceeded
to the location

13:34.214 --> 13:36.182
and attempted
to arrest the defendant.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.051
Attempted to arrest him?

13:38.084 --> 13:39.419
Mr. Blaylock
looked in my direction

13:39.452 --> 13:40.887
then took off running.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.388
My partner and I chased him
for several blocks

13:42.422 --> 13:44.157
until he ran into an alley
with a dead end.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.592
What happened then?

13:45.626 --> 13:47.360
I placed him under arrest,

13:47.393 --> 13:49.329
and he was subsequently
identified in the lineup

13:49.362 --> 13:50.330
by Anita Cosgrove.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.232
Thank you, Sir.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.869
Mr. Bassett?

14:04.210 --> 14:06.146
One moment, please, judge.

14:11.017 --> 14:11.852
I don't think
we really need

14:11.885 --> 14:14.120
to get anything out
of this witness.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.422
Would you mind if
I asked him a few questions?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.892
Oh, go ahead.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.362
Officer, when you arrived
at the location

14:22.395 --> 14:23.930
to arrest my client,

14:23.964 --> 14:25.932
were you or your partner
in uniform?

14:25.966 --> 14:27.467
No. We were
in plain clothes.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.502
Was your car marked
or unmarked?

14:28.535 --> 14:30.103
Unmarked.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.105
And that neighborhood is known
by your department

14:32.138 --> 14:34.240
to have a high level
of criminal activity,

14:34.274 --> 14:35.241
including shootings.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.210
Yes.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.112
So it's entirely possible
that when Mr. Blaylock

14:39.145 --> 14:40.681
saw an unmarked car pull
to a sudden stop,

14:40.714 --> 14:42.516
you and your partner
jump out of that car

14:42.549 --> 14:44.384
in street clothes with guns,

14:44.417 --> 14:46.319
that he might not have realized
that you were police officers.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.955
I called out
and identified myself.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.691
But you can't be sure
that he believed you

14:50.724 --> 14:51.692
or even heard you.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.127
No, I can't.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.162
Thank you.

15:02.368 --> 15:04.571
Good job.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.346
MAN: It would be easy,

15:13.379 --> 15:14.715
under the circumstances,

15:14.748 --> 15:18.351
to say, "gee, I guess
I never really knew him.

15:18.384 --> 15:21.154
He wasn't
who I thought he was."

15:21.187 --> 15:23.724
I would discourage you
from thinking that.

15:23.757 --> 15:28.261
Mental illness is an illness,

15:28.294 --> 15:31.164
and George simply became ill.

15:31.197 --> 15:33.534
That doesn't negate
the kind man you knew,

15:33.567 --> 15:35.168
the gentle man.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.170
George was that.

15:37.203 --> 15:39.172
He was not a man of hate,

15:39.205 --> 15:42.709
and it would be wrong for us
to feel hatred towards him

15:42.743 --> 15:46.580
because of symptoms
he suffered from.

15:46.613 --> 15:52.586
I hope that we resist the urge
to think we never knew him

15:52.619 --> 15:57.057
and instead simply admit

15:57.090 --> 16:00.360
we never knew the depths
of his illness.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.233
They're calling him
as their next witness.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.735
I heard. Where is he?

16:08.769 --> 16:10.403
Men's room.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.072
I feel bad for her.

16:12.105 --> 16:15.475
I'm sure she never thought
it would end up like this.

16:15.509 --> 16:17.343
Judge is returning.

16:17.377 --> 16:18.679
Okay.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.047
He's going to get crucified
in that witness chair.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.248
They're hoping he'll blow.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.217
He knows
he has to stay calm.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.686
He's got no chance
of staying calm.

16:25.719 --> 16:26.753
We both know it.

16:26.787 --> 16:28.221
Can't we work this out?

16:28.254 --> 16:29.523
He won't budge.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.691
He's crazy.

16:30.724 --> 16:33.359
That's up to the judge
to decide, not us.

16:33.393 --> 16:37.330
Bobby, he's going
to get hurt.

16:37.363 --> 16:41.668
If you love him
as much as you say...

16:45.271 --> 16:47.073
I better get him.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.543
Ray, you in here?

16:53.547 --> 16:55.115
Ray?

17:02.856 --> 17:06.059
(Ray whimpering)

17:13.867 --> 17:15.401
Close the door.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.203
Oh, god.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.405
She's out there.

17:19.439 --> 17:22.275
Who?

17:22.308 --> 17:26.311
Joanne --
she wants to kill me.

17:26.346 --> 17:29.583
Oh, Ray.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.118
Don't! Don't touch those.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.487
No, she's on to my scent.
Don't. Don't.

17:34.521 --> 17:38.391
Ray, you are due
to take the stand

17:38.424 --> 17:40.093
in two minutes.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.429
Who are you?

17:45.431 --> 17:47.701
It's me -- Bobby.

17:47.734 --> 17:52.348
Bobby? Bob-- oh, Bobby.

17:54.440 --> 18:00.313
I-I always --
I always considered Bobby...

18:00.346 --> 18:02.816
My son, you know.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.157
Get a continuance.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.325
Why? What --

18:12.358 --> 18:14.528
just tell the judge
he's taken ill.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.196
We'll continue it tomorrow.

18:17.898 --> 18:19.733
I was waiting
at a bus stop.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.603
He walked up to me
as I was sitting there

18:22.636 --> 18:25.338
and asked if I had change
for his $20 bill for the bus.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.372
The defendant?

18:26.406 --> 18:27.541
Yes.

18:27.574 --> 18:30.376
I opened my purse
to see if I had change.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.647
When I looked up
to hand him the money,

18:33.680 --> 18:35.215
there it was.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.617
There what was?

18:36.650 --> 18:39.219
His sad, pathetic,
little penis...

18:39.252 --> 18:40.353
Aroused.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.455
And what was going
through your mind

18:42.488 --> 18:43.890
as this happened?

18:43.924 --> 18:49.763
Shock, fear, disgust.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.464
And did you have
an occasion

18:51.497 --> 18:53.499
to see Mr. Blaylock again
before today?

18:53.534 --> 18:55.301
Yes. About four weeks later,

18:55.335 --> 18:57.938
I saw him standing there
loitering at the same bus stop.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.373
I called the police.
They came and got him.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.142
Thank you.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.146
Yours.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.150
No questions, your honor.

19:11.785 --> 19:15.221
Just a few from me.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.790
You had never
seen the perpetrator

19:16.823 --> 19:18.692
prior to the day
he exposed himself.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.693
No.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.394
And the day of the incident,

19:21.427 --> 19:23.429
you described the guy
who did it to the police.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.965
Yes.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.667
Events were still fresh
in your mind at that time.

19:26.700 --> 19:27.668
Yes.

19:27.701 --> 19:29.335
And you were very careful

19:29.369 --> 19:30.971
to give as much detail
as you could to the police

19:31.004 --> 19:32.606
so that they
could catch the person.

19:32.639 --> 19:33.974
Right.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.676
Now, did the police ask you

19:35.709 --> 19:38.411
about things like
approximate height and weight?

19:38.444 --> 19:40.446
Yes.
I told them all that.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.984
And do you remember
if they asked

19:44.017 --> 19:45.619
whether the perpetrator

19:45.652 --> 19:47.621
had any distinguishing
physical characteristics?

19:47.654 --> 19:49.455
I do remember, and I
told them, no, he didn't.

19:49.489 --> 19:53.894
No unusual markings, tattoos,
piercings or deformities --

19:53.927 --> 19:57.297
nothing unusual in any way
about his body.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.699
No.

19:58.732 --> 20:02.235
Thank you, ma'am.
That's all I have.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.272
You embarrass me
in front of the jury

20:06.306 --> 20:07.808
when you jump up like that.

20:07.841 --> 20:09.375
Embarrass you?

20:09.409 --> 20:11.845
We had to establish
what she saw or didn't see.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.480
She said, "sad, pathetic,
little penis," on direct.

20:14.515 --> 20:15.749
That's all we needed.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.317
Not in my opinion, and --

20:17.350 --> 20:18.484
well, you're second chair,
Eugene.

20:18.519 --> 20:19.853
The judge wouldn't let you

20:19.886 --> 20:21.387
try this case
by yourself, Harland.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.756
What does that tell you?

20:22.789 --> 20:24.558
Now, I don't want
to be on this case,

20:24.591 --> 20:26.026
but I am on it,
and I'm not here

20:26.059 --> 20:27.928
to set up some
inadequate counsel appeal

20:27.961 --> 20:29.563
where he can take a number
behind all your other clients.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.732
Don't you talk to me
like that.

20:31.765 --> 20:33.466
I may not have won
a jury trial yet,

20:33.499 --> 20:35.301
but I've won plenty
of motions,

20:35.335 --> 20:37.337
and I'm a good lawyer
in that room.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.540
No, you're not, Harland.

20:39.573 --> 20:42.909
Now, you're a nice man,
but you're not a good lawyer.

20:51.785 --> 20:54.755
I'm going to take
Marvin's testimony.

20:54.788 --> 20:56.389
You can back me up

20:56.422 --> 20:58.491
if you think
I've missed anything.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.427
Okay.

21:09.603 --> 21:12.639
You know the craziest thing
next to him?

21:12.673 --> 21:14.040
We should win.

21:14.074 --> 21:15.742
They haven't made their burden

21:15.776 --> 21:17.644
that he can't manage
his financial affairs.

21:17.678 --> 21:19.546
He can be naked in as many
bathrooms as he wants,

21:19.580 --> 21:20.914
but if his affairs
are in order...

21:20.947 --> 21:24.785
Bobby, we have a problem.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.432
Where's Ray?
Is he all right?

21:39.465 --> 21:40.967
Oh, yeah. He's fine.

21:42.703 --> 21:44.538
Ray.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.607
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.441
Bobby.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.611
Oh, god.

21:50.644 --> 21:53.980
Bobby, are these
really necessary?

21:54.014 --> 21:55.949
Ray, what happened?

21:55.982 --> 21:57.417
She tried to kill me.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.452
Joanne? What do you mean?

21:59.485 --> 22:01.822
Yes. She had a knife,
a knife,

22:01.855 --> 22:06.092
and I-I just swung
to knock her away.

22:06.126 --> 22:07.961
Wait, wait, wait.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.531
Do you realize
what you've done?

22:10.564 --> 22:14.067
It was self-defense.
She tried to kill me.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.003
She tried to kill me.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.010
Okay, Ray. Okay, okay.

22:24.044 --> 22:26.112
Okay.

22:26.146 --> 22:29.115
Okay, okay.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.797
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.032
He swears
she tried to kill him.

22:49.570 --> 22:51.905
I don't want
to go to trial.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.540
Neither do I.

22:53.574 --> 22:54.808
Going after Raymond Oz

22:54.841 --> 22:56.810
won't win me
any popularity contests.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.979
So what kind of deal
can we make?

22:59.012 --> 23:01.648
Manslaughter -- we can ask
for light sentencing,

23:01.682 --> 23:02.883
maybe framing him.

23:02.916 --> 23:06.019
Helen, I can't let him
do any time.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.921
The man is nearly 80.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.056
He blugent a woman to death.

23:13.594 --> 23:15.729
How 'bout an NGI plea?

23:15.762 --> 23:17.497
Insanity?

23:17.531 --> 23:19.199
You know,
call it temporary,

23:19.232 --> 23:21.467
get the right shrink
at the psych exam.

23:21.502 --> 23:22.869
I'll back you.

23:26.707 --> 23:28.408
Thanks.

23:31.512 --> 23:33.680
I thought these two guys
were trying to kill me.

23:33.714 --> 23:35.215
I didn't know they were cops.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.517
That's why you ran?

23:36.550 --> 23:37.618
Yeah, and when
they told me

23:37.651 --> 23:39.185
what they were
arresting me for,

23:39.219 --> 23:41.187
that's the first I heard
about any of this.

23:41.221 --> 23:43.489
You didn't present yourself
to Anita Cosgrove

23:43.524 --> 23:44.525
like she described?

23:44.558 --> 23:46.527
No.

23:46.560 --> 23:50.797
You heard Anita Cosgrove
testify that the perpetrator

23:50.831 --> 23:52.999
had no unusual
physical characteristics?

23:53.033 --> 23:55.035
Is there anything
about your body

23:55.068 --> 23:57.938
that differs
from that description?

23:57.971 --> 23:59.506
Yes, there is.

23:59.540 --> 24:01.942
Could you tell the jury
what that is, please?

24:01.975 --> 24:06.146
I was blessed
with a large penis.

24:06.179 --> 24:07.514
What was that?

24:07.548 --> 24:09.516
I'm huge, judge.

24:09.550 --> 24:10.784
(gallery laughs)

24:10.817 --> 24:12.719
Counsel, step, please --
everybody.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.563
Where the hell
is this going?

24:22.596 --> 24:23.564
The complaining witness

24:23.597 --> 24:25.966
has said that my client
has a sad, little penis

24:25.999 --> 24:28.535
with no unusual
physical characteristics.

24:28.569 --> 24:30.737
That is inconsistent
with the physical evidence

24:30.771 --> 24:32.105
I'm about to introduce.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.608
What introduce?
You're offering photographs?

24:34.641 --> 24:37.243
Actually, no.
I would like the jury

24:37.277 --> 24:38.845
to have a viewing.

24:38.879 --> 24:41.748
You're asking me
to let your client

24:41.782 --> 24:43.283
Drop his pants in court?

24:43.316 --> 24:45.251
Photos wouldn't
do it justice.

24:45.285 --> 24:47.588
The jury wouldn't get
the full dimensional effect.

24:47.621 --> 24:49.255
My client
has a constitutional right

24:49.289 --> 24:51.958
to present his girth,
your honor.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.261
Don't look at me.

24:55.295 --> 24:58.732
That would be lud and lacidious
condouct all over again.

24:58.765 --> 25:02.035
The intent wouild only be
exculpitory evidence.

25:04.905 --> 25:08.174
Well, I'm not
doing it here.

25:11.712 --> 25:13.146
Members of the jury,

25:13.179 --> 25:16.950
we will all be adjourning
to my chambers.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.652
Let's go.

25:21.254 --> 25:23.724
Isn't this exciting?

25:25.726 --> 25:27.694
Well, evidently she knew

25:27.728 --> 25:30.964
she was losing
that incompetency motion,

25:30.997 --> 25:33.333
and killing me
seemed to be

25:33.366 --> 25:37.804
the only other recourse
she had of getting my money.

25:37.838 --> 25:39.706
I can't --

25:39.740 --> 25:41.341
I still can't believe it.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.777
The police don't believe
that Joanne

25:43.810 --> 25:45.912
was trying to kill you.

25:45.946 --> 25:47.614
I must say,

25:47.648 --> 25:51.184
I have a hard time
believing it myself.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.887
They're offering you
a deal --

25:53.920 --> 25:58.058
no contest with 12 months
hospital commitment.

25:58.091 --> 26:00.026
Insanity?

26:02.696 --> 26:03.830
Ridiculous.

26:03.864 --> 26:05.932
Our case is weak.

26:05.966 --> 26:09.102
Didn't they check the knife
for her fingerprints?

26:09.135 --> 26:11.738
It was a kitchen knife, Ray.

26:11.772 --> 26:13.774
She was fixing dinner.

26:24.718 --> 26:27.688
I think we should
take the deal.

26:29.790 --> 26:33.293
It was self-defense, Bobby.

26:33.326 --> 26:37.397
Self-defense, I tell you.

26:37.430 --> 26:40.901
Now, there won't be
any deal.

26:42.736 --> 26:45.706
LINDSAY: You're not the man's
mother or his minister.

26:45.739 --> 26:47.974
If he wants to go down
on self-defense,

26:48.008 --> 26:50.243
that's his right.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.846
I can't accept that.
And by the way,

26:52.879 --> 26:53.980
maybe I am his mother. He's --

26:54.014 --> 26:55.649
We have to listen
to the client.

26:55.682 --> 26:57.383
The client is crazy!

26:57.417 --> 26:58.384
Yesterday you said that was

26:58.418 --> 26:59.686
for the court to decide,
not us.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.421
That was before
he murdered his wife.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.056
He's obviously nuts.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.058
Won't the court order
a psychiatric evaluation

27:05.091 --> 27:06.793
before he can stand trial?

27:06.827 --> 27:09.062
If he understands the charges,
he'll pass the test.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.264
Why don't we see how it goes
before we decide anything?

27:11.297 --> 27:13.266
For the arraignment,
let's enter not guilty.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.268
In which case
Helen will pull the offer

27:15.301 --> 27:17.270
and he could end up
going to prison.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.139
Look, the guy's insane.
Let's just dump him.

27:19.172 --> 27:21.174
Haven't we had enough
crazy clients?

27:21.207 --> 27:24.678
Ask to be let out,
for god's sake.

27:31.885 --> 27:34.120
I know
I've apologized twice,

27:34.154 --> 27:36.857
but I'm going to
do it one more time

27:36.890 --> 27:39.693
to convey the court's
embarrassment.

27:39.726 --> 27:43.029
But every defendant
is entitled

27:43.063 --> 27:46.299
to a complete
and zealous defense.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.801
So...

27:53.807 --> 27:56.276
Mr. Blaylock, go ahead.

28:14.127 --> 28:16.062
What's that --

28:16.096 --> 28:17.063
it's pierced.

28:17.097 --> 28:18.431
Which is another thing

28:18.464 --> 28:19.933
the complaining witness
would have noticed

28:19.966 --> 28:21.267
had it been my client.

28:21.301 --> 28:23.203
All right, we've seen enough,
Mr. Blaylock.

28:23.236 --> 28:25.806
Excuse me, your honor,
I feel that the jury

28:25.839 --> 28:27.473
still has not
the full appreciation

28:27.508 --> 28:29.342
of my client's endowment

28:29.375 --> 28:30.410
in its current state.

28:30.443 --> 28:33.446
What are you asking for now,
that he get aroused?

28:33.479 --> 28:36.850
No, no, if the court will allow,

28:36.883 --> 28:39.452
I will simply place

28:39.485 --> 28:40.921
in the ring...

28:44.057 --> 28:45.759
Ladies and gentamlemen
of the jury.

28:45.792 --> 28:46.527
I object to this.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.795
Hurry up counsel.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.363
You keep looking at me.

28:54.801 --> 28:57.904
It was humiliating, and for
Harland, it was a career high.

28:57.938 --> 28:59.105
It's almost over.

28:59.139 --> 29:00.874
Look, I'm not picking straws on
this kind of crap anymore.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.408
People say,
"Where's the dignity in law

29:02.442 --> 29:03.644
these days?"
Well, it's not in that room.

29:03.677 --> 29:05.411
Well, there's no dignity in
an innocent man going to jail.

29:05.445 --> 29:06.312
If Harland prevents that --

29:06.346 --> 29:08.448
He could have got
the same evidence in

29:08.481 --> 29:10.316
using photographs.
He wanted to be sensational

29:10.350 --> 29:12.152
because he's a loser
who's never won a case.

29:12.185 --> 29:14.087
Come on, Eugene.
We're not above

29:14.120 --> 29:16.523
humiliating other people
to get acquittals.

29:16.557 --> 29:18.424
We can't taste
the medicine ourselves?

29:18.458 --> 29:21.427
-Where's Bobby?
-Right here. What's up?

29:21.461 --> 29:23.163
The stock on ginkgo.
You were right.

29:23.196 --> 29:24.164
Raymond passed
the psychiatric exam.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.532
You see?

29:25.566 --> 29:27.568
They found him competent
to participate in his defense.

29:27.601 --> 29:30.303
Which means he can
reject insanity.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.172
I got to talk to him.

29:32.205 --> 29:34.474
Hey, Lindsay, it's Helen.

29:34.508 --> 29:37.043
She's having a little
roommate problem.

29:37.077 --> 29:39.379
Helen?

29:39.412 --> 29:42.115
She has been holed up
in that room all day.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.449
I try to talk to her,

29:43.483 --> 29:45.385
and she just looks at me
in a violent way.

29:45.418 --> 29:47.954
This is a week after
I save this woman's life.

29:47.988 --> 29:49.422
All right.

29:53.093 --> 29:55.328
(knocks on door)

30:00.601 --> 30:03.436
Hey, what's going on?

30:06.607 --> 30:08.241
Ellenor?

30:10.611 --> 30:13.947
I never apologized to you,
did I?

30:13.980 --> 30:16.482
For what?

30:16.517 --> 30:21.121
What Mcguire said.
I brought George Vogelman to the
party.

30:21.154 --> 30:22.889
He tried to murder you.

30:22.923 --> 30:25.091
Ellenor, you couldn't
have known --

30:25.125 --> 30:27.093
I have to face
the reality, Lindsay.

30:27.127 --> 30:28.529
I have a total incapacity

30:28.562 --> 30:30.496
when it comes
to reading people.

30:30.531 --> 30:32.533
That's not true.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.637
I don't know if I can ever,

30:36.670 --> 30:40.541
ever let myself
trust anybody again.

30:45.311 --> 30:46.847
You will.

30:49.049 --> 30:52.018
No...

30:52.052 --> 30:56.289
I have this
truly awful feeling

30:56.322 --> 30:57.958
that I won't.

31:00.594 --> 31:04.397
And you know George?

31:04.430 --> 31:05.331
I...

31:09.435 --> 31:12.873
Am I sick
for grieving for him?

31:14.708 --> 31:16.577
No.

31:20.180 --> 31:21.615
No.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.029
Of course I passed.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.064
Passing a competency exam
to stand trial

31:38.098 --> 31:40.967
does not mean you're sane.
I don't have to tell you that.

31:41.001 --> 31:44.037
But it does mean
I can direct my lawyers,

31:44.070 --> 31:45.572
and we reject insanity.

31:45.606 --> 31:46.707
Ray.

31:46.740 --> 31:49.142
Did you tell her?
Did you tell Joanne

31:49.175 --> 31:51.411
that I passed
the psychiatric exam?

31:52.212 --> 31:54.214
Raymond...

31:56.116 --> 31:59.986
Joanne is -- is dead.

32:00.020 --> 32:02.288
You're charged
with killing her.

32:06.192 --> 32:07.193
Oh.

32:07.227 --> 32:10.230
Y-yes, she's dead.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.201
Can I see her?

32:24.144 --> 32:26.046
I don't think so.

32:28.682 --> 32:30.751
Listen, the only way
that I can

32:30.784 --> 32:33.654
effectively
represent you here

32:33.687 --> 32:35.622
is to plead insanity.

32:35.656 --> 32:37.123
It's not going to happen.

32:37.157 --> 32:38.491
You confessed.

32:38.525 --> 32:41.494
No. No, I said self-defense,

32:41.528 --> 32:44.030
and they have nothing
to dispute that.

32:44.064 --> 32:46.232
Now, look here,
we have to get

32:46.266 --> 32:47.033
the forensic reports.

32:47.067 --> 32:49.570
Oh, and talk
to Joanne's lawyer.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.305
Privilege does not survive
Joanne's death.

32:52.338 --> 32:54.741
Now, the lawyer may be able
to tell us something.

32:54.775 --> 32:58.645
Raymond, you're ill.

32:58.679 --> 33:02.315
You need to let me
help you.

33:02.348 --> 33:07.588
Look, you say I'm like
a son to you.

33:07.621 --> 33:09.155
At some point,

33:09.189 --> 33:13.259
fathers let their sons
take care of things.

33:13.293 --> 33:16.530
I won't.
I won't plead insanity.

33:18.799 --> 33:22.135
My legacy cannot be that.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.437
I cannot go out on that.

33:27.574 --> 33:31.144
I want to be judged
not guilty

33:31.177 --> 33:33.179
on the elements.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.187
Bobby...

33:44.124 --> 33:46.292
Where --

33:46.326 --> 33:48.194
where is she?

33:50.463 --> 33:52.398
She's gone, Ray.

33:56.469 --> 33:57.604
She's gone.

34:18.559 --> 34:20.193
So you're going
to withdraw?

34:20.226 --> 34:21.261
I don't have any choice.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.196
I don't get why you say that.
You have a choice.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.797
What, go for
a straight not guilty?

34:24.831 --> 34:26.399
Yes. We do it
all the time --

34:26.431 --> 34:29.101
go for straight not guilty
with guilty clients.

34:29.135 --> 34:30.536
Why can't we do it here?

34:30.571 --> 34:31.638
Good question.

34:31.672 --> 34:34.274
It just feels
more obscene here.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.810
I mean, he's --
it's not a game.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.880
It's somebody I love,
and he's gone mad.

34:39.913 --> 34:42.148
But we can get him off
just the same.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.518
It is possible.

34:46.386 --> 34:49.121
I have a bit
of a confession to make.

34:49.155 --> 34:50.824
I'm a lousy lawyer.

34:50.857 --> 34:52.759
Not that it's relevant

34:52.793 --> 34:55.228
or even appropriate
for me to talk about

34:55.261 --> 34:57.197
in a closing argument,

34:57.230 --> 34:59.666
but I've never won
a jury trial.

34:59.700 --> 35:01.501
About 10 years ago

35:01.535 --> 35:04.738
I lost so much confidence,
I only took on clients

35:04.771 --> 35:06.907
I knew were guilty.

35:06.940 --> 35:09.409
That way when the conviction
came down,

35:09.442 --> 35:12.913
I wouldn't feel
totally responsible.

35:12.946 --> 35:15.481
But it hurts...

35:15.516 --> 35:17.918
Never winning.

35:17.951 --> 35:19.219
Mr. Bassett.

35:19.252 --> 35:21.154
Sorry.

35:23.256 --> 35:25.659
But I took on
an innocent one here,

35:25.692 --> 35:28.662
ladies and gentlemen.

35:28.695 --> 35:31.765
I'd like to say
it was for his sake,

35:31.798 --> 35:34.868
but it was more for mine.

35:34.901 --> 35:37.871
The physical evidence

35:37.904 --> 35:40.273
completely and totally
contradicts

35:40.306 --> 35:42.509
the complaining witness'
testimony.

35:42.543 --> 35:46.813
She identified the wrong man.

35:48.815 --> 35:52.418
And, even a terrible lawyer
can't change

35:52.452 --> 35:57.257
what we all know
to be the truth.

35:57.290 --> 35:59.793
Marvin Blaylock

35:59.826 --> 36:03.229
is an innocent man.

36:29.790 --> 36:31.592
Commonwealth
versus Raymond Oz,

36:31.625 --> 36:32.859
murder in the first degree.

36:32.893 --> 36:34.795
Bobby Donnell for
the defense. Waive reading.

36:34.828 --> 36:35.729
Helen Gamble
for the commonwealth.

36:35.762 --> 36:37.731
The defendant enters a plea
of not guilty.

36:37.764 --> 36:38.999
We'd ask that Mr. Oz
be released

36:39.032 --> 36:40.366
on his own recognizance.

36:40.400 --> 36:41.902
Did he undergo
a psychiatric?

36:41.935 --> 36:43.269
And passed.

36:43.303 --> 36:44.738
He has established roots
in the community.

36:44.771 --> 36:45.872
He's well known.

36:45.906 --> 36:48.809
$1 million bond,
$200,000 cash.

36:48.842 --> 36:52.979
Your honor, I'd like
to represent myself.

36:53.013 --> 36:56.382
Mr. Oz, I need
hardly remind you

36:56.416 --> 36:59.385
that a man who hires himself
for his lawyer --

36:59.419 --> 37:01.454
gets billed just the same.

37:01.487 --> 37:02.923
I'm well aware, your honor.

37:02.956 --> 37:07.661
However, since most people
would seek out Raymond Oz

37:07.694 --> 37:08.995
in this circumstance,

37:09.029 --> 37:11.297
I see no reason why
I shouldn't do the same,

37:11.331 --> 37:13.567
particularly when I stand
a pretty good chance

37:13.600 --> 37:14.835
of reaching him.

37:14.868 --> 37:16.737
I don't think
it's appropriate

37:16.770 --> 37:18.905
to enjoy a murder trial,
Mr. Oz,

37:18.939 --> 37:21.775
especially when
your own wife is the victim.

37:21.808 --> 37:25.779
Well, your honor, I...

37:30.884 --> 37:34.387
I think that I understand
the, uh,

37:34.420 --> 37:36.757
risks of self-representation,

37:36.790 --> 37:38.959
and I am prepared
to assume them,

37:38.992 --> 37:41.662
and it is my right.

37:41.695 --> 37:44.631
Your honor does believe
in rights, I assume,

37:44.665 --> 37:46.767
unless, of course,
the reports

37:46.800 --> 37:50.804
of your judicial integrity
are exaggerated.

37:52.539 --> 37:54.941
I will allow you
to represent yourself,

37:54.975 --> 37:57.978
but I'm ordering Mr. Donnell
to stay on as co-counsel.

37:58.011 --> 37:59.445
I don't need him.

37:59.479 --> 38:01.782
Well, then you'll
just have to humor me.

38:01.815 --> 38:04.417
I would like to have
an immediate trial date,

38:04.450 --> 38:06.520
your honor.
There's no discovery necessary,

38:06.553 --> 38:07.954
and I will stipulate
to the forensics.

38:07.988 --> 38:10.090
And I am an old man,

38:10.123 --> 38:11.958
and I really would like
to be acquitted

38:11.992 --> 38:13.527
before I die.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.696
We can go in three weeks,

38:15.729 --> 38:18.999
as long as Ms. Gamble
doesn't object.

38:19.032 --> 38:20.166
We can be ready.

38:20.200 --> 38:23.537
Mr. Oz, I have half a mind
to declare you incompetent.

38:23.570 --> 38:26.707
And if you had the other half,
you could call me crazy.

38:26.740 --> 38:28.642
(laughter)

38:28.675 --> 38:30.376
See probation.

38:30.410 --> 38:32.445
We'll conference,
set a trial date.

38:32.478 --> 38:33.479
Adjourned.

38:33.514 --> 38:35.081
WOMAN: Mr. Oz.

38:35.115 --> 38:38.118
Mr. Oz, what will be
your legal strategy?

38:38.151 --> 38:40.554
I wouldn't presume
to declare

38:40.587 --> 38:42.355
a legal strategy,
ladies and gentlemen.

38:42.388 --> 38:43.857
No, suffice it to say,
any lawyer

38:43.890 --> 38:46.860
considers himself lucky
if the facts in a case

38:46.893 --> 38:48.795
support his claim,
and here they do.

38:48.829 --> 38:51.331
You ready for this?

38:52.398 --> 38:53.634
Are you?

38:53.667 --> 38:55.702
Forgot to ask a very simple

38:55.736 --> 38:57.370
and important question --

38:57.403 --> 39:00.373
what really happened?
What really happened?

39:00.406 --> 39:03.476
Now, I not only intend
to raise that question,

39:03.510 --> 39:06.647
but I intend
to answer it fully.

39:23.764 --> 39:26.733
Thank you.

39:26.767 --> 39:29.603
Will the defendant
please rise?

39:31.505 --> 39:34.107
Madame foreperson, the jury
has reached a verdict?

39:34.140 --> 39:35.475
We have.

39:35.509 --> 39:37.177
What say you?

39:37.210 --> 39:38.945
Commonwealth
vs Marvin Blaylock

39:38.979 --> 39:40.747
on the charge of lewd
and lascivious behavior --

39:40.781 --> 39:44.017
we find the defendant
Marvin Blaylock...

39:44.050 --> 39:45.418
Guilty.

39:45.451 --> 39:46.753
What?

39:46.787 --> 39:49.756
Members of the jury,
this completes your service.

39:49.790 --> 39:53.594
You're free to go
with the court's thanks.

39:53.627 --> 39:55.862
Mr. Blaylock, see probation.

39:55.896 --> 39:58.765
We'll be heard on sentencing
next Tuesday.

39:58.799 --> 40:00.701
Adjourned.

40:00.734 --> 40:03.704
I can't -- what happened?

40:03.737 --> 40:05.772
You tried a good case,
Harland.

40:05.806 --> 40:08.141
I-I don't understand.

40:08.174 --> 40:10.644
MAN: Mr. Young?

40:17.984 --> 40:20.220
I'm Dr. Robert Pyne.
I was on the jury.

40:20.253 --> 40:23.056
I know I'm not supposed
to say anything, but...

40:23.089 --> 40:24.224
But what?

40:24.257 --> 40:25.959
I'm a plastic surgeon.

40:25.992 --> 40:28.529
I specialize
in penile enlargement.

40:28.562 --> 40:30.096
I saw the markings.

40:30.130 --> 40:32.533
Your client
altered the evidence.

40:32.566 --> 40:34.701
Is that what was
discussed back there?

40:34.735 --> 40:36.570
Your honor.

40:36.603 --> 40:39.873
Mr. Crilly, approach.

40:42.609 --> 40:45.178
Defense moves for a mistrial.

40:45.211 --> 40:47.480
This juror's a plastic surgeon
who offered testimony

40:47.514 --> 40:49.983
during deliberations
which affected the verdict.

40:50.016 --> 40:50.851
What?

40:50.884 --> 40:53.019
He's a plastic surgeon.
He saw scars.

40:53.053 --> 40:55.556
He concluded that my client
had his penis enlarged.

40:55.589 --> 40:57.090
Is that true?

40:57.123 --> 40:59.593
-Yes.
-You got to throw it out, judge.

40:59.626 --> 41:01.127
Why? The jury's free
to evaluate --

41:01.161 --> 41:02.829
this guy's a plastic surgeon
who off--

41:02.863 --> 41:05.131
look, I've wasted enough time
on this case.

41:05.165 --> 41:07.734
I am not going to start over.

41:07.768 --> 41:10.971
The deliberations
were tainted.

41:16.810 --> 41:20.681
30-day sentence, all suspended,
conditioned on counseling.

41:20.714 --> 41:23.917
You can't do better than that.
You won't with a new trial.

41:24.017 --> 41:25.185
No time served?

41:25.218 --> 41:27.721
Take it and smile.

41:27.754 --> 41:29.055
Done.

41:33.259 --> 41:34.895
All suspended.

41:34.928 --> 41:37.163
You don't serve a day.
We got to get you counseling.

41:37.197 --> 41:39.633
-But no time?
-No time.

41:39.666 --> 41:40.801
Great.

41:43.904 --> 41:45.171
Harland?

41:45.205 --> 41:46.807
Huh?

41:46.840 --> 41:49.810
Oh, great.

41:49.843 --> 41:52.145
Good result.

41:52.178 --> 41:54.648
Good...

41:54.681 --> 41:56.850
Result.

42:26.947 --> 42:29.950
(crying)

42:48.101 --> 42:49.970
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

42:50.003 --> 42:52.806
after all the evidence
has been presented,

42:52.839 --> 42:55.241
you must take it back
into that room

42:55.275 --> 42:57.978
along with your duty --

42:58.011 --> 43:00.346
your duty to uphold the law,

43:00.380 --> 43:04.985
your duty to hold the state
to its burden of proof.

43:05.018 --> 43:07.087
Because, you see,
ladies and gentlemen,

43:07.120 --> 43:09.990
this is still a country
where people are free,

43:10.023 --> 43:12.726
and for you to take away
a man's freedom,

43:12.759 --> 43:15.261
for you to remove him
from the free world,

43:15.295 --> 43:18.098
you must find guilt
beyond reasonable doubt.

43:18.131 --> 43:19.900
That is all doubt.

43:19.933 --> 43:21.301
Not most doubt,

43:21.334 --> 43:24.137
not a great majority
of doubt,

43:24.170 --> 43:26.139
all doubt.

43:26.172 --> 43:28.408
All right, all right.

43:28.441 --> 43:32.145
Duty, land of the free,

43:32.178 --> 43:34.047
all doubt.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.081
Yeah.

43:42.055 --> 43:45.058
â™ª

44:08.849 --> 44:09.850
WOMAN: You stinker!
