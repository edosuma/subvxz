WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.583
[narrator] Previously on X-Men.

00:03.583 --> 00:07.250
Dr. Adler claims his process
can reverse genetic mutations

00:07.250 --> 00:09.000
within each cell of the body.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.083
What?

00:10.083 --> 00:12.125
Some mutants might welcome

00:12.125 --> 00:14.458
the chance to become normal.

00:14.458 --> 00:16.083
Yeah? Who?

00:16.083 --> 00:18.875
I hear you can change people,
Doctor.

00:18.875 --> 00:21.000
Change them, so they won't be
mutants anymore.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.875
I don't wanna live my whole life

00:22.875 --> 00:25.458
without knowing what it's like
to touch another human being.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.833
In the mood for a hot date?

00:27.833 --> 00:29.000
In a bull's-eye.

00:30.083 --> 00:32.416
She has great powers.

00:32.416 --> 00:37.291
You will use the machine
to make her my slave.

00:37.291 --> 00:40.750
So your machine
doesn't cure mutants.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.833
It turns them
into slaves of Apocalypse.

00:43.833 --> 00:45.875
I'm looking for Gottfried Adler.

00:45.875 --> 00:47.625
Of course, you are, old darling.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.333
Don't call me darling.

00:51.333 --> 00:56.333
I know more of this world
than you have even dreamed.

00:56.333 --> 01:00.166
That is why I must destroy it.

02:03.625 --> 02:05.583
A new way of life is beginning

02:05.583 --> 02:08.458
for mutant-kind,
Mr. Worthington.

02:08.458 --> 02:12.375
Free of the pain
caused by your mutantcy.

02:12.375 --> 02:14.458
I can't thank you enough,
Dr. Adler.

02:14.875 --> 02:17.583
Your cure will give me
what I've always wanted,

02:17.583 --> 02:20.708
the chance to be
an ordinary human being.

02:21.166 --> 02:24.208
Not a mutant, not a freak.

02:24.208 --> 02:28.208
It was your funding that made
the transformation process
possible.

02:28.208 --> 02:32.333
It's only fitting that you
should be the first
to undergo the treatment.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.208
[latch closes]

02:34.208 --> 02:38.416
I caution you there may be
some discomfort at first.

02:41.958 --> 02:44.000
[machine beeps]
Whatever it takes, Doctor.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.833
Make me a new man.

02:45.833 --> 02:49.125
You will be surprised
at just how new.

02:50.291 --> 02:51.416
[gasps]

02:52.000 --> 02:53.291
[chuckles]

02:54.416 --> 02:55.750
[groaning]

02:58.708 --> 03:00.000
[mystique gasps]

03:00.000 --> 03:02.458
See, the transformation begins.

03:03.708 --> 03:05.000
Excellent.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.458
You serve me well, Mystique.

03:09.208 --> 03:12.083
Such loyalty will be rewarded.

03:12.875 --> 03:16.458
The rest shall be my slaves.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.250
Increase the power.

03:19.208 --> 03:21.833
I want to hear the cries

03:21.833 --> 03:25.333
of a future being born!

03:26.458 --> 03:28.375
[Archangel screaming]

03:33.458 --> 03:35.166
[Kieros] Where's Adler?

03:35.166 --> 03:38.833
I've been waiting a month.
I want my cure!

03:38.833 --> 03:42.625
We all do, sweetie. Sit down.

03:44.875 --> 03:47.208
Can't a girl have
a cup of coffee in peace?

03:47.750 --> 03:51.708
They haven't learned
how to live at ease
with their mutant powers,

03:51.708 --> 03:53.875
so they are frustrated.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.208
Some lash out,

03:55.208 --> 03:57.250
while some have turned inward,

03:57.250 --> 04:00.000
[gasps]
letting their bitterness
consume them.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.708
But they all feel dissatisfied
with themselves and alone.

04:04.708 --> 04:07.708
You've given us a place
where we belong, Professor.

04:07.708 --> 04:10.958
Just takes us hard-headed ones
longer to realize it.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.000
Forget about it, Rogue.

04:13.583 --> 04:16.583
We've all had a hard time
accepting who we are.

04:16.583 --> 04:19.291
I'm cured! I'm cured! See?

04:19.291 --> 04:23.000
My wings are gone.
Dr. Adler's treatment works!

04:23.000 --> 04:24.833
I'm not a mutant anymore!

04:25.458 --> 04:27.875
You don't have to be mutants!

04:27.875 --> 04:30.000
You don't have to be hated!

04:30.000 --> 04:32.375
You can be cured!

04:32.375 --> 04:35.375
We're mutants!
That's what we are!

04:35.375 --> 04:38.375
There's nothing wrong with us
that needs to be cured!

04:38.375 --> 04:40.708
Look me in the eye
and tell me that!

04:40.708 --> 04:43.083
It'll be my pleasure!

04:43.083 --> 04:44.625
[Xavier] Cyclops! No!

04:45.333 --> 04:49.000
It's not our place to tell
other mutants what to do.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.500
If Adler can really change
mutants into ordinary humans,

04:53.166 --> 04:56.458
then each of us'll have to look
into his own heart and decide.

04:56.458 --> 05:00.125
You won't be laughed at
or feared anymore!

05:00.125 --> 05:02.250
You'll be like everybody else!

05:03.000 --> 05:04.875
[mutants clamoring]

05:04.875 --> 05:06.875
It's time we headed home.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.291
Who wants to be normal?

05:10.708 --> 05:12.458
[Kieros] Me! Take me next!

05:12.458 --> 05:14.333
Me!

05:14.333 --> 05:15.875
Cure me!

05:17.958 --> 05:22.750
Mystique impersonates you
very well, Mr. Worthington.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.333
Worthington is no more.

05:25.333 --> 05:28.208
Now there is only Archangel.

05:28.958 --> 05:31.875
Let the world beware.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.583
[Apocalypse]
The old world passes away.

05:38.083 --> 05:42.166
Together we shall forge
a new one

05:42.166 --> 05:44.166
in fire and blood!

05:45.000 --> 05:48.708
The future is transformed!

05:48.708 --> 05:54.583
I am the instrument
to purify the world!

05:54.583 --> 05:59.250
The evil of human and mutant
must be cut away!

05:59.250 --> 06:03.625
You shall help me
tear down the old order!

06:03.625 --> 06:09.416
Those who oppose me
shall perish through
my agents of destruction.

06:10.875 --> 06:13.458
Famine. Pestilence.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.750
War.

06:18.750 --> 06:21.750
And my greatest creation,

06:22.375 --> 06:26.500
Death, the Winged Avenger!

06:26.500 --> 06:32.000
From the ashes of this world,
I will build a better one!

06:32.458 --> 06:35.166
Go forth, my Horsemen,

06:38.875 --> 06:42.833
and let chaos
cleanse the world!

06:46.375 --> 06:48.833
Looks like you're behind
the old eight ball, Gambit,

06:48.833 --> 06:50.833
and I'm about to sink it.

06:50.833 --> 06:53.000
You not win the game yet,
chere.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.833
Could be you need incentive.

06:55.833 --> 06:59.000
How about the winner
get a kiss from the loser?

07:04.291 --> 07:07.708
That's not funny!
Or do you want to
end up in a coma?

07:07.708 --> 07:10.958
You can drain my energy
anytime, chere.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.291
Gambit has plenty.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.500
Observe.

07:16.958 --> 07:19.208
First, we charge the cue.

07:19.208 --> 07:21.375
Don't let Gambit
get to you, Rogue.

07:21.375 --> 07:24.750
I'd like to wipe that smirk
off his face.

07:24.750 --> 07:27.583
Serve him right if I did give
that low-life a kiss.

07:27.583 --> 07:31.333
Maybe Monsieur
Gambit's not as good
as he thinks he is.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.708
Looks like you nicked
the table, Gambit.

07:36.708 --> 07:37.958
[Storm] Gambit!

07:38.500 --> 07:42.000
The term "rec room" does not
mean that you must wreck it.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.750
Storm makes jokes now.
What next?

07:45.750 --> 07:48.416
Hopes are high as leaders

07:48.416 --> 07:50.291
from around the world
meet in Paris this week

07:50.291 --> 07:53.458
for the conventional
weapons disarmament talks.

07:53.458 --> 07:56.000
But much tough
negotiation lies ahead.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.708
Wait, here's
the Conference Chairman now.

07:58.708 --> 08:00.000
Good day.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.416
The leaders of the world
recognize

08:02.416 --> 08:05.083
the desire of people
everywhere for peace.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.250
But we must proceed carefully.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.458
Can we disarm when mutants
walk among us?

08:12.250 --> 08:14.166
Many questions must be answered

08:14.166 --> 08:18.416
if we are to ensure
a secure future for humankind.

08:18.416 --> 08:20.083
[all cheering]

08:20.083 --> 08:24.333
[Apocalypse] Fools!
You bleat for the future

08:24.333 --> 08:26.083
like a herd of sheep!

08:26.625 --> 08:30.458
I'll give you the future
right now!

08:31.000 --> 08:32.458
[all screaming]

08:33.333 --> 08:35.166
I'm not sure what's happening,

08:35.166 --> 08:37.583
but it appears
that a mutant terrorist

08:37.583 --> 08:39.458
is disrupting
the peace conference!

08:40.375 --> 08:42.708
[Jean] Storm. What's happening?

08:42.708 --> 08:45.583
Trouble
at the World Peace Conference.

08:46.291 --> 08:47.416
Stop that mutant!

08:49.416 --> 08:53.458
The weak and afraid
shall be smashed!

08:53.458 --> 08:54.708
Show them!

08:57.500 --> 08:59.083
[screaming]

08:59.083 --> 09:01.416
Looks more like
a World War Conference.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.625
We must tell Xavier.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.750
You can't run

09:03.750 --> 09:06.000
from a few mutants! [gasps]

09:06.000 --> 09:10.625
I am Apocalypse!

09:11.750 --> 09:15.875
Look upon the future
and tremble!

09:24.500 --> 09:26.583
[news anchor]
The army is counter-attacking!

09:29.583 --> 09:32.458
War! Archangel!

09:33.291 --> 09:35.583
Destroy the irritants!

09:59.333 --> 10:02.458
Who can protect us
from these mutant terrorists?

10:02.458 --> 10:08.250
No one can save you
from the touch of Pestilence!

10:10.000 --> 10:11.375
No!

10:14.583 --> 10:17.166
All who oppose me

10:17.625 --> 10:20.583
shall be crushed!

10:21.000 --> 10:23.583
This is what
I've feared the most,

10:24.000 --> 10:28.583
a powerful mutant driven
completely mad by his powers.

10:29.166 --> 10:30.875
This isn't like Magneto

10:30.875 --> 10:34.000
or the conspirators
who produced the Sentinels.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.625
They could be appealed to,
reasoned with...

10:36.625 --> 10:39.291
We have to stop Apocalypse now,

10:39.291 --> 10:43.291
or there will be no future
for anyone.

10:53.833 --> 10:55.833
Why can't I go with them,
Professor?

10:55.833 --> 10:57.708
They'll need all the help
they can get.

10:57.708 --> 10:59.458
I have another mission for you.

11:00.083 --> 11:03.208
I recognized the mutants
with Apocalypse.

11:03.208 --> 11:06.583
They were all on Muir Island,
hoping for Dr. Adler's cure.

11:06.583 --> 11:10.000
But one interests me
more than the others.

11:10.708 --> 11:14.125
This is the mutant who claimed
that Dr. Adler had cured him.

11:14.125 --> 11:17.125
I want you to return
to Muir Island.

11:17.125 --> 11:21.875
Dr. Adler's cure
could hold the key
to defeating this madman.

11:21.875 --> 11:23.833
On my way, Professor.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.708
If there's something fishy
going on up there, I'll find it.

11:38.166 --> 11:42.458
Each generation has cried out
for a new world,

11:43.333 --> 11:47.958
but has built the same old one,
corrupt and weak!

11:48.583 --> 11:52.000
But the new world
shall come to pass!

11:52.458 --> 11:56.500
I will purge the earth
of these benighted humans!

11:56.500 --> 11:59.083
Take the food from their mouths!

12:00.583 --> 12:03.625
[gasping] No! Please!
[gasping] No! Food!

12:04.708 --> 12:06.583
Help! I need food!
Please help.

12:06.583 --> 12:08.250
Food, please!

12:09.208 --> 12:11.750
Turn their weapons against them!

12:17.208 --> 12:20.583
War shall be their destruction!

12:28.958 --> 12:31.708
Exterminate them.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.083
[Archangel] We will.

12:41.083 --> 12:44.875
They shall be purified
with fire and water!

12:59.333 --> 13:01.875
I never thought I'd see
this place again.

13:01.875 --> 13:05.583
Looks like the doc's doing
a little remodeling.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.375
Dr. Adler!

13:10.125 --> 13:13.583
What a pleasure it is
to see you again, my dear.

13:13.583 --> 13:16.291
You thinking about putting in
a skylight, Doc?

13:16.291 --> 13:20.208
Experiments sometimes
have unforeseen results.

13:20.208 --> 13:22.583
It's your results
I'm interested in.

13:22.583 --> 13:25.083
I discuss my treatment
with no one.

13:25.083 --> 13:27.208
You'll discuss it with me, Doc!

13:27.208 --> 13:30.875
What are you doing? No! Don't!

13:31.625 --> 13:33.750
What did your cure do
to those mutants?

13:33.750 --> 13:35.375
What would it have done to me?

13:37.166 --> 13:40.250
No! Please! I'll tell you!

13:40.750 --> 13:44.625
Well, looks like we got another
mutant ready for the cure.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.500
There is no cure.

13:46.500 --> 13:50.625
Apocalypse uses the treatment
to turn mutants into his slaves.

13:50.625 --> 13:54.500
It makes them hate everyone,
humans and mutants,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.416
like Apocalypse does.

13:56.416 --> 13:58.625
He wants to destroy everything.

13:58.625 --> 14:02.458
I had to help him,
he would have killed me.

14:02.458 --> 14:07.708
He has a secret command center
buried under Stonehenge,
in England.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.000
[grunts]

14:10.000 --> 14:12.458
Old Apocalypse won't like
that you helped me.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.708
You'd better find
some place to hide.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.458
Who's gonna tell him?

14:19.458 --> 14:21.000
Hey!

14:21.000 --> 14:22.500
[Rogue exclaims]

14:27.833 --> 14:29.583
We needed that machine!

14:29.583 --> 14:32.250
It might be the only way
to change those mutants back!

14:32.250 --> 14:35.458
No one can stop Apocalypse!

14:42.000 --> 14:43.583
I'm gonna try!

14:51.583 --> 14:53.708
[people screaming in fear]

14:55.291 --> 14:57.083
Fools!

14:57.083 --> 15:00.375
They cannot stop
what they cannot touch!

15:03.083 --> 15:05.416
[Cyclops] Remember,
careful with the civilians.

15:06.125 --> 15:07.416
[Wolverine] Sure, Cyke.

15:07.416 --> 15:08.875
I'll try not to bruise them

15:08.875 --> 15:10.291
while I save their lives.

15:10.833 --> 15:16.000
Even mutants may feel
the touch of Pestilence!

15:16.000 --> 15:17.125
[Wolverine] Incoming!

15:17.125 --> 15:18.833
We can't let her touch them!

15:20.708 --> 15:25.250
Rise, fog, and divert
our enemy from her path!

15:25.250 --> 15:28.708
Storm, your master, commands!

15:30.375 --> 15:32.708
[Pestilence] I can't see!

15:36.833 --> 15:38.250
[screaming]

15:40.291 --> 15:41.583
[groans]

15:43.333 --> 15:46.333
It'll be a while before you
plague humanity again.

15:49.958 --> 15:53.750
[Archangel] Who dares oppose the
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse?

15:57.958 --> 15:59.750
The X-Men do, bub!

16:02.958 --> 16:06.625
Don't you think we're getting
a little carried away, here?

16:09.708 --> 16:10.708
Hey!

16:13.583 --> 16:16.291
Pig-faced runt
couldn't take a joke.

16:19.875 --> 16:22.750
Feel the horror of War!

16:28.875 --> 16:30.375
Wolverine!

16:33.500 --> 16:34.708
Thanks, Cajun.

16:34.708 --> 16:36.291
[coughing]

16:36.875 --> 16:38.708
I think.

16:38.708 --> 16:40.000
They are getting away!

16:42.000 --> 16:44.458
And they'll lead us
to Apocalypse.

16:53.958 --> 16:57.333
I wonder what rock
that snake's a-hiding under?

16:57.333 --> 17:00.583
Come on, big boy,
where's your hospitality?

17:01.166 --> 17:05.500
You had your chance
to be the first of my creatures,

17:05.500 --> 17:08.708
the first to serve my will.

17:08.708 --> 17:10.708
Dang, and I missed it!

17:14.000 --> 17:15.125
[exclaims]

17:16.708 --> 17:18.958
Weak and foolish mutant!

17:19.625 --> 17:23.000
You are corrupted
by those who want peace!

17:23.000 --> 17:24.458
You cannot oppose me!

17:27.583 --> 17:30.708
You're corrupt
like all the others.

17:31.458 --> 17:32.958
[grunts]

17:32.958 --> 17:35.500
You must be exterminated!

17:36.750 --> 17:39.958
The Professor was right.
You are crazy.

17:41.166 --> 17:44.958
[Archangel] Apocalypse, a band
of mutants has defeated us!

17:47.833 --> 17:49.583
We are not worthy!

17:50.291 --> 17:51.708
No!

17:52.375 --> 17:55.125
My creatures cannot be defeated!

17:55.708 --> 17:58.291
I cannot be defeated!

18:00.875 --> 18:03.083
We beg to differ.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.708
[laughing]

18:06.875 --> 18:10.416
Destroy them all!

18:27.166 --> 18:32.500
Pestilence shall separate
the weak from the strong!

18:39.000 --> 18:41.333
I gotta slow these folks down.

18:50.416 --> 18:53.875
It is time to
welcome Death, X-Men!

18:54.833 --> 18:57.583
Let's see if I can't improve
your disposition.

18:57.583 --> 18:59.708
No!

19:04.333 --> 19:05.500
[screaming]

19:07.125 --> 19:09.125
What-- What have I done?

19:11.125 --> 19:14.375
Stop! There's been
enough destruction!

19:15.125 --> 19:16.583
Stop!

19:19.583 --> 19:20.875
[Famine screams]

19:22.125 --> 19:23.583
No!

19:24.583 --> 19:26.083
You are not fit!

19:27.208 --> 19:29.750
You are not worthy!

19:30.458 --> 19:35.000
You are only
delaying the inevitable.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.583
Wanna bet?

19:45.291 --> 19:47.250
[Storm] Cyclops! Jean!
They're getting away!

19:53.458 --> 19:55.083
[Archangel exclaims]

19:57.875 --> 19:59.125
Get clear!

20:13.000 --> 20:14.875
I wanted to be normal,

20:14.875 --> 20:18.583
but all I did was prove that
I'm capable of terrible evil.

20:19.291 --> 20:20.875
It wasn't your fault.

20:21.625 --> 20:24.708
I wanted to deny myself,
too, for a time.

20:24.708 --> 20:27.291
That could have been me
helping that madman.

20:27.708 --> 20:31.458
Don't worry. I took the evil
away when I touched you.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.583
It's a part of me now.

20:33.583 --> 20:36.333
I just hope you're strong
enough to control it.

20:37.708 --> 20:38.708
I wasn't.
