00:07.187 --> 00:08.354
Hello...

00:08.355 --> 00:10.423
...Dr. Orpheus and team.

00:10.424 --> 00:14.894
You have been approved for your very own
Guild-certified Supervillain.

00:14.895 --> 00:17.296
Here at the Guild of Calamitous lntent...

00:17.297 --> 00:19.766
your nemesis is our business.

00:19.767 --> 00:22.935
But don't take our word on it,
right, Sovereign?

00:22.936 --> 00:25.872
That's right, Ward. Since 1910...

00:25.873 --> 00:30.109
the Guild has been providing
first-rate professional menace...

00:30.110 --> 00:32.110
to all who qualify.

00:32.112 --> 00:33.846
1910!

00:33.847 --> 00:36.349
That's a history you can trust.

00:36.350 --> 00:40.586
The Guild is the recognized leader
in organized havoc.

00:40.587 --> 00:43.087
Just look at these numbers!

00:43.123 --> 00:46.492
Those are some
impressive figures, Sovereign.

00:46.493 --> 00:49.195
Why would a hero
look anywhere else for a villain?

00:49.196 --> 00:51.631
Hold on a minute, Ward.
Why doesn't...

00:51.632 --> 00:53.633
...Dr. Orpheus and team...

00:53.634 --> 00:55.935
just get his own
costumed enemy?

00:55.936 --> 00:58.671
Oh, watch.
Will you ever learn?

00:58.672 --> 01:03.172
l think this little film
may help you understand.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

01:24.198 --> 01:25.231
Pumpkin...

01:25.232 --> 01:26.666
who delivered this?

01:26.667 --> 01:29.469
Some guy in a winter coat
and Techno goggles.

01:29.470 --> 01:31.604
Only he had, like, pipes coming out of him.

01:31.605 --> 01:34.774
- Why, is the movie busted or something?
- No. lt's just that...

01:34.775 --> 01:37.176
lf it's ''splash,'' l put it on your Netflix list.

01:37.177 --> 01:39.846
No, no, no. lt's not that. ''Splash?''

01:39.847 --> 01:43.516
- l just wanted to see it again.
- Why would you want...? Hold on.

01:43.517 --> 01:47.053
Your scheduled screening
will take place at the time specified...

01:47.054 --> 01:50.823
and thank you for selecting
the Guild of Calamitous lntent...

01:50.824 --> 01:52.925
as the instrument of your demise.

01:52.926 --> 01:56.919
''Team''? ''Lair''? l don't have...

01:56.964 --> 02:00.092
Today? Today?!

02:26.360 --> 02:28.094
Cool beans. What is it?

02:28.095 --> 02:30.696
lt's a walking eye, Hank,
and the Government loves them.

02:30.697 --> 02:32.331
- What does it do?
- l don't know.

02:32.332 --> 02:35.034
Walking-eye stuff, whatever.
This isn't rocket science.

02:35.035 --> 02:37.336
lt could be considered
a branch of rocket science.

02:37.337 --> 02:39.105
- Camera in the eye?
- Completely.

02:39.106 --> 02:41.707
- So, it shoots lasers and stuff?
- Daddy's little man.

02:41.708 --> 02:44.177
Probably a bucket
comes down for, like, water...

02:44.178 --> 02:47.446
or even, like, monkeys
that could totally drive it.

02:47.447 --> 02:49.048
Thank you, Hank. Way to go.

02:49.049 --> 02:51.651
l guess it would be good
for stealth reconnaissance.

02:51.652 --> 02:54.921
Well, of course it would be good
for reconnaissance applications.

02:54.922 --> 02:59.916
- Well, what does it do?
- Walking eye! lt... Well...

02:59.960 --> 03:03.196
lt has a camera, iris-mounted lasers,
monkeyproof welding...

03:03.197 --> 03:07.366
and silent stealth design that makes it
perfect for reconnaissance applications.

03:07.367 --> 03:09.802
- You got that from us!
- Walking eye, Hank!

03:09.803 --> 03:13.306
They're all the same.
l have it written down from yesterday.

03:13.307 --> 03:14.774
What was that?

03:14.775 --> 03:16.809
We've got a massive breach
at the main gates.

03:16.810 --> 03:20.213
Of course! That is a walking eye.
Will you do something about it...

03:20.214 --> 03:22.648
or do you want to finish
your Tetris game first?

03:22.649 --> 03:25.952
Do something? Yeah.
l'm opening the secondary gates.

03:25.953 --> 03:28.087
What the...?
lt's like hell on earth out there.

03:28.088 --> 03:31.557
Yo, check it!
That car is totally shaped like a dragon.

03:31.558 --> 03:34.220
- Choppers!
- Guild wasps.

03:34.261 --> 03:38.864
l got to go deal with this.
They're landing in my herb garden.

03:38.865 --> 03:42.301
- Time to die, Jefferson Twilight.
- Sorry, man.

03:42.302 --> 03:45.638
l just dropped off my laundry today.
Maybe we can do this next week.

03:45.639 --> 03:46.872
lt won't hurt a bit.

03:46.873 --> 03:49.609
l recall the process
as being quite unpleasant...

03:49.610 --> 03:51.811
but it's getting hard to remember.

03:51.812 --> 03:55.302
lt's been a while.
Two hundred years.

03:58.852 --> 04:00.753
Dude, this is gonna...

04:00.754 --> 04:03.322
Man, this is gonna
wicked, like, really hurt.

04:03.323 --> 04:05.291
- Please don't!
- Need them for my necklace.

04:05.292 --> 04:10.182
You want me to wait till
after l take your head off?

04:12.966 --> 04:15.466
Told you.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.771
l haven't talked to you in, like, 16 years.

04:18.772 --> 04:23.876
You suddenly show up and rescue my...
What gives? You rescued my situation.

04:23.877 --> 04:25.811
That was a coincidence, dear friend.

04:25.812 --> 04:29.548
l am here to extend an offer
from the Guild of Calamitous lntent.

04:29.549 --> 04:32.718
Get out. Approval?
A name-brand archenemy?

04:32.719 --> 04:35.688
That took long enough,
but...this is so...

04:35.689 --> 04:38.858
That is...
But, man, you had a kid...

04:38.859 --> 04:42.094
got married, and got into that
''Balancing good and evil'' crap.

04:42.095 --> 04:45.264
My wife left me,
my daughter has a driver's license....

04:45.265 --> 04:49.302
and keeping the cosmos from chaos
lacks so much of the razzle-dazzle.

04:49.303 --> 04:51.437
My peers perceive me as a layabout.

04:51.438 --> 04:55.541
No, man. You have a secret identity.
That's classic comic stuff.

04:55.542 --> 04:59.111
You're like Captain...
You're all Aquaman.

04:59.112 --> 05:01.514
Aquaman doesn't have
a secret identity.

05:01.515 --> 05:03.916
- He's always Aquaman.
- OK. Bad example.

05:03.917 --> 05:07.186
Nobody believes
that Aquaman is a stay-at-home dad.

05:07.187 --> 05:09.221
Everybody knows
what Aquaman does.

05:09.222 --> 05:10.990
l don't know
what Aquaman does.

05:10.991 --> 05:13.893
Doesn't he, like, protect
some lame, fake-ass kingdom?

05:13.894 --> 05:15.695
l thought he fought Black Manta.

05:15.696 --> 05:18.597
Come on!
Why won't he just die?

05:18.598 --> 05:23.118
You got to remove his head,
but l get the teeth.

05:23.870 --> 05:27.506
Dude, l was about to kill you!
l have dangerous catlike reflexes.

05:27.507 --> 05:30.910
Oh, yeah. You were terrifying
when you crapped your pants.

05:30.911 --> 05:32.111
What do you got there?

05:32.112 --> 05:34.947
This, my friend, is our future.
Check it out.

05:34.948 --> 05:38.117
Second-class arching license
and reassignment pass.

05:38.118 --> 05:41.645
You're 6 feet and 1 35 pounds?

05:41.688 --> 05:44.423
- Nobody reads it. You just flash it.
- You're joking.

05:44.424 --> 05:47.827
- You would suck at arching on your own.
- That's why l made you one.

05:47.828 --> 05:51.364
You can't say no till l show you
the piece de rÃ©sistance.

05:51.365 --> 05:53.699
Here's a hint.
Flying chick magnet.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.201
Let me think about th--

05:55.202 --> 05:58.270
No! l almost die every day
doing this job.

05:58.271 --> 06:00.239
Come on. You got to.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.008
You're telling me we can't do
this better than The Monarch?

06:03.009 --> 06:05.311
Yes! Exactly that.

06:05.312 --> 06:08.848
Do you have any idea
how ruthless The Monarch is?

06:08.849 --> 06:12.114
l don't blame you for desiring me.

06:12.152 --> 06:15.519
The Monarch is delicious. Now say it!

06:15.555 --> 06:17.623
- l need my King Butterfly.
- Deeper.

06:17.624 --> 06:19.291
- l need my...
- Deeper.

06:19.292 --> 06:20.893
- l need...
- No. Deeper.

06:20.894 --> 06:23.329
- ...butterfly.
- Deeper, way deeper.

06:23.330 --> 06:25.030
- Butterfly.
- Deeper.

06:25.031 --> 06:26.165
- King...
- Deeper.

06:26.166 --> 06:27.633
- ...butterfly.
- lt's deeper.

06:27.634 --> 06:31.263
l need my butterfly.

06:31.304 --> 06:32.705
King Butterfly!

06:32.706 --> 06:35.504
- l need my King...
- Deeper.

06:35.542 --> 06:38.043
Deeper than that. Way deeper.

06:38.044 --> 06:41.080
So, you share a lair with Dr. Orpheus?

06:41.081 --> 06:45.151
- Hardly. He rents an apartment from me.
- l can't believe that we are standing...

06:45.152 --> 06:48.354
in the same conference room
the Treaty of Tolerance was signed in.

06:48.355 --> 06:51.824
Yes. So cool.
Your father is a legend at the Guild.

06:51.825 --> 06:53.025
Yeah. Legend.

06:53.026 --> 06:55.227
He's responsible
for stealing my father's leg.

06:55.228 --> 06:56.529
Don't start me!

06:56.530 --> 06:59.598
The real Dr. Venture
is why l got into this business.

06:59.599 --> 07:01.467
Just keep the nuts away from my lab...

07:01.468 --> 07:06.005
because l have some pretty
impressive things going on in there.

07:06.006 --> 07:07.273
No. Shut up.

07:07.274 --> 07:09.942
Yeah. We'll do our best
to keep him away from your...

07:09.943 --> 07:12.611
- lmpressive.
- Yeah. lmpressive stuff.

07:12.612 --> 07:15.080
You better.
Where's Mr. Magic?

07:15.081 --> 07:17.950
How come the prom queen
isn't here to crown his king?

07:17.951 --> 07:20.286
- He's astral-projecting, l think.
- Showoff.

07:20.287 --> 07:23.255
- To assemble his team.
- A team?

07:23.256 --> 07:27.856
You mean, he was approved
as a team? What a wuss!

07:29.429 --> 07:31.929
Jealous.

07:32.732 --> 07:35.462
The Alchemist, l presume.

07:35.502 --> 07:39.138
Byron Orpheus,
you old bag of salt crackers!

07:39.139 --> 07:42.241
- How long has it been?
- Too long, my friend.

07:42.242 --> 07:47.502
Let me in. l can't astral-project
because l'm not magic.

07:47.514 --> 07:51.383
Knew it. Still all on that stool
and looking for the Philosopher's Stone.

07:51.384 --> 07:53.978
l see that, right there.

07:54.020 --> 07:57.790
The Philosopher's Stone
is a metaphor for enlightenment.

07:57.791 --> 08:00.526
So, in a way, yes,
l am searching for it.

08:00.527 --> 08:02.795
ln the cure for AlDS.

08:02.796 --> 08:06.065
Noble. Now l feel
a little stupid for asking you this.

08:06.066 --> 08:08.501
So you're still...you know.

08:08.502 --> 08:11.036
Nah, l grew out of that.
Yeah, you know...

08:11.037 --> 08:12.738
lt was just a phase, and l...

08:12.739 --> 08:16.242
- No. Of course l am. Hello?
- Hey, just asking.

08:16.243 --> 08:21.010
We're thinking of reforming
the Order of the Triad!

08:21.047 --> 08:24.149
l...we have been approved
for an archvillain.

08:24.150 --> 08:25.518
Great! l'm in.

08:25.519 --> 08:29.021
- But what of your most important work?
- l need the publicity.

08:29.022 --> 08:32.224
You know, nothing gets the people
in your corner like that hero crap.

08:32.225 --> 08:34.293
- See?
- What? l'm here, aren't l?

08:34.294 --> 08:36.395
Plus, l could use the exercise.

08:36.395 --> 08:39.631
l don't know about you guys,
but l'm getting a little paunchy.

08:39.633 --> 08:42.835
Tell me about it.
At least you have a robe to hide it.

08:42.836 --> 08:45.204
Oh, come on.
Black is slimming. No. No.

08:45.205 --> 08:47.873
l mean, black clothing is slimming.

08:47.874 --> 08:50.309
You gentlemen
should switch to pinstripes.

08:50.310 --> 08:52.810
lt leads the eye down.

08:57.117 --> 08:59.351
Hank, l need to speak
to your brother alone.

08:59.352 --> 09:02.021
- You told us we can't leave our room.
- Go sit in the bathroom.

09:02.022 --> 09:03.889
- And do what?
- Wash your face or something.

09:03.890 --> 09:05.591
You don't take care of your pimples...

09:05.592 --> 09:08.127
you'll end up like F. Murray Abraham
or Edward Olmos.

09:08.128 --> 09:12.064
Do you want to look like somebody
made your face out of a beige orange peel?

09:12.065 --> 09:16.402
All right, Dean. l need to talk
about a few things with you.

09:16.403 --> 09:18.170
- Hank did it.
- Not that.

09:18.171 --> 09:20.539
Dr. Orpheus asked me
to watch his daughter...

09:20.540 --> 09:23.309
which your father can't do
because he doesn't care to.

09:23.310 --> 09:25.744
So, l want you and Hank
to entertain her today.

09:25.745 --> 09:28.781
Triana? So you want us
to put on a show for her?

09:28.782 --> 09:31.417
Should we write a script,
or do something she knows?

09:31.418 --> 09:35.354
- Oh, my goodness. We need costumes!
- l thought you would react this way.

09:35.355 --> 09:38.324
Now sit down and
let me explain something...

09:38.325 --> 09:43.485
that every boy your age has known
for, like, five years.

09:49.135 --> 09:53.606
And there she is. You can see her
right there writhing on the hood of the car.

09:53.607 --> 09:58.577
- What was David Coverdale to do?
- Break up...White Lion?

09:58.578 --> 10:00.512
That's Whitesnake,
Dean, and yes.

10:00.513 --> 10:05.250
Both Brock and l lay the blame squarely
on Tawny's hot, silky shoulders.

10:05.251 --> 10:06.852
Now, let that be a lesson to you.

10:06.853 --> 10:11.083
- About what?
- l'm so glad we had this talk.

10:11.791 --> 10:14.126
Are those what l think they are?

10:14.127 --> 10:17.129
Only if you think they're jet packs
because those are jet packs.

10:17.130 --> 10:19.798
- Where'd you get those?
- Spoils of war, my friend.

10:19.799 --> 10:21.634
Yeah. Sergeant Hatred's, l think.

10:21.635 --> 10:24.036
Please tell me you
filed them with Supplies.

10:24.037 --> 10:27.306
Oh, my God, when did you
become such a dainty little flower?

10:27.307 --> 10:31.310
When the idiot l work with
forged documents and stole jet packs!

10:31.311 --> 10:34.680
Look. You telling me you don't want
to fly into some chick's window...

10:34.681 --> 10:38.751
all super cool with, like,
a three-day beard and a...jet pack?

10:38.752 --> 10:41.420
- Granted, that is kind of sweet.
- lt is so sweet.

10:41.421 --> 10:45.090
- We'll need costumes.
- Got them, and they are so leather.

10:45.091 --> 10:47.760
l'll be totally flying
into some hot chick's bedroom.

10:47.761 --> 10:52.197
Totally, and she'd be dating the good guy,
and l'll come in, and l'll be all...

10:52.198 --> 10:56.468
''l'll spare his life
but only for you, sugar pants.''

10:56.469 --> 10:58.671
Dude, and then
you will have sex!

10:58.672 --> 11:01.539
You will be having sex. Sex!

11:02.676 --> 11:05.477
Get out of my sight.
The money is on the bed stand.

11:05.478 --> 11:08.147
- You'll find its amount generous.
- Thanks, sugar.

11:08.148 --> 11:10.249
Can you give me directions
to Liberty Street?

11:10.250 --> 11:11.717
Listen and listen well!

11:11.718 --> 11:14.586
The road before you
is beset with many perils.

11:14.587 --> 11:16.922
Every turn you make
will bring you closer...

11:16.923 --> 11:19.925
to the cold,
waiting hands of sister fate.

11:19.926 --> 11:23.295
Or just the center of town?
Do you have a pen?

11:23.296 --> 11:25.998
- Maybe l should...
- Bear me, Theseus...

11:25.999 --> 11:28.669
for l am the mighty Minotaur!

11:35.709 --> 11:38.510
This cocoon
has witnessed your sins...

11:38.511 --> 11:40.779
and she seeks vengeance.

11:40.780 --> 11:43.148
The cocoon
will punish the wicked.

11:43.149 --> 11:46.485
The cocoon
will reward the righteous.

11:46.486 --> 11:49.121
You must
escape from her grasp.

11:49.122 --> 11:51.457
You must
earn your freedom!

11:51.458 --> 11:54.338
Dude, l really don't have time.

11:55.462 --> 11:58.262
How much
do you want to live?

12:05.338 --> 12:07.706
Looks like we're up
for the same arch.

12:07.707 --> 12:10.876
- l'm the lntangible Fancy.
- Torrid.

12:10.877 --> 12:13.245
Fire theme. Lucky duck.

12:13.246 --> 12:16.348
Lots of costume options
with a fire theme.

12:16.349 --> 12:19.518
Guys like me,
we can't even wear costumes.

12:19.519 --> 12:20.886
Do you have...?

12:20.887 --> 12:23.387
Genitals? Not anymore.

12:25.558 --> 12:28.761
- Why, isn't that Dr. Venture's lab?
- Yes. l believe it is.

12:28.762 --> 12:30.729
Save my place in the queue.

12:30.730 --> 12:33.565
There's something l feel l must do.

12:33.566 --> 12:36.729
Something...torrid.

12:36.770 --> 12:40.467
Well, we'll keep
your resume on file...

12:40.507 --> 12:42.508
and we'll get back to you.

12:42.509 --> 12:44.343
OK. Thanks for your time.

12:44.344 --> 12:47.746
Wait. l have a question. What...?
What is that on your head?

12:47.747 --> 12:49.348
- That like a rudder?
- Yeah. Right.

12:49.349 --> 12:55.053
What, do you steer with your head
or something? That's just dumb.

12:55.054 --> 12:57.122
Comes out like easy cheese.

12:57.123 --> 13:01.383
Got to get back
on the benzoyl-peroxide train.

13:01.594 --> 13:03.962
Don't bother to knock or anything.

13:03.963 --> 13:06.463
Bloody hell!

13:11.371 --> 13:12.404
Dean!

13:12.405 --> 13:15.407
Dude, you said
you had leather costumes.

13:15.408 --> 13:17.342
The pads are leather.
Leatherlike.

13:17.343 --> 13:20.979
Where did you get these things
and why is there a bowl on my helmet?

13:20.980 --> 13:23.515
Yeah. l was on Family Double Dare
Totally swiped it.

13:23.516 --> 13:26.385
Yeah. Well, that makes me
feel better about all the stains.

13:26.386 --> 13:29.087
Yeah. That's gak.
You know, physical challenge?

13:29.088 --> 13:31.256
- All right. Let's do this. Ready?
- Thank God!

13:31.257 --> 13:35.527
A guy can only wear a jet pack
for so long without using it.

13:35.528 --> 13:37.362
Dude! My shoe's on fire!

13:37.363 --> 13:39.698
l just lit my shoes on fire!

13:39.699 --> 13:42.199
Wait up!

13:42.769 --> 13:44.570
lt's not working!

13:44.571 --> 13:47.597
Hold on! Time!

13:47.640 --> 13:50.075
Yes. l only hunt Blackulas.

13:50.076 --> 13:52.477
So you only hunt
African-American vampires.

13:52.478 --> 13:54.580
No. Sometimes
l hunt British vampires.

13:54.581 --> 13:56.815
They don't have
African-Americans in England.

13:56.816 --> 13:58.450
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Good point.

13:58.451 --> 14:00.986
- So l hunt Blackulas.
- l was just trying to be...

14:00.987 --> 14:05.090
l specialize in hunting black vampires.
l don't know what the PC name for that is.

14:05.091 --> 14:06.892
ls that a mask?

14:06.893 --> 14:10.513
Oh, my God,
l was just gonna ask that!

14:11.664 --> 14:15.667
What a fascinating puritan you are,
Lady Windermere.

14:15.668 --> 14:19.204
The adjective was unnecessary,
Lord Darlington.

14:19.205 --> 14:20.439
l couldn't help it.

14:20.440 --> 14:23.308
l can resist everything
except temptation.

14:23.309 --> 14:26.044
You have the modern
affectation of weakness.

14:26.045 --> 14:31.185
lt's only an affectation,
Lady Win...Winder...Windermere.

14:31.484 --> 14:34.286
Hank, come on.
Enter the Duchess of Berwick!

14:34.287 --> 14:37.222
l'm in the bathroom,
and you got to get in here.

14:37.223 --> 14:41.560
lt smells like gunpowder
throw-up poo-poo eggs.

14:41.561 --> 14:44.129
Oh, that's my exit.
Dean, you owe me one.

14:44.130 --> 14:47.799
Triana, you feel like playing
Lord whatever-the-hell?

14:47.800 --> 14:48.934
No, not really.

14:48.935 --> 14:51.770
Brock, you can't go.
You're also Lady Agatha.

14:51.771 --> 14:55.340
No, Dean. For serious,
come smell this already!

14:55.341 --> 14:59.038
OK, Curse.
Was it Curse or Chris?

14:59.078 --> 15:01.046
Curse. We can use magic, right?

15:01.047 --> 15:02.247
That's kind of my bag.

15:02.248 --> 15:04.349
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

15:04.350 --> 15:06.251
- Bring it on.
- Magic is a plus.

15:06.252 --> 15:08.387
On three, we give him
the old Rochambeau.

15:08.388 --> 15:09.821
Rock, paper, scissors?

15:09.822 --> 15:13.392
What does a General from the American
Revolution have to do with this?

15:13.393 --> 15:16.595
American Revolution?
''Rochambeau'' sounds French to me.

15:16.596 --> 15:19.064
Well, yes.
The Franco-American forces...

15:19.065 --> 15:20.999
They fought with SpaghettiOs
and meatballs?

15:21.000 --> 15:26.830
Why would a company called
''Franco-American'' make ltalian food?

15:27.006 --> 15:29.506
Dijnam stopeus.

15:30.276 --> 15:32.776
O spiritus sancti.

15:33.379 --> 15:34.446
Yeah.

15:34.447 --> 15:37.974
OK, gentlemen.
That ruled.

15:38.017 --> 15:40.352
- Was that the Rochambeau?
- No.

15:40.353 --> 15:42.853
lt really should be!

15:45.258 --> 15:47.758
But which door to choose?

15:47.760 --> 15:52.397
That one could have fun, surprises,
and a year's supply of turtle wax behind it.

15:52.398 --> 15:55.765
Or the polar bear from Lost.

15:55.802 --> 15:58.170
Probably not the best idea, Doc.

15:58.171 --> 16:00.739
You said everything
is running itself over there.

16:00.740 --> 16:04.576
Don't you remember telling me
that nobody cares about my walking eye?

16:04.577 --> 16:07.479
Well, l didn't mean
for you to take it outside.

16:07.480 --> 16:10.349
- Needs air.
- All right. Watch your head.

16:10.350 --> 16:13.085
What's up with your outfit?
Did you have an away game?

16:13.086 --> 16:15.487
Helping Dean put on the worst version...

16:15.488 --> 16:19.720
of Lady Windermere's Fan
to impress Triana.

16:19.759 --> 16:21.360
Said it was your idea.

16:21.361 --> 16:24.363
Hardly. l was trying to tell him
about the birds and the bees.

16:24.364 --> 16:26.631
Yeah. How did that work out for you?

16:26.632 --> 16:28.900
He staged Lady Windermere's Fan.

16:28.901 --> 16:33.005
You should see a doctor! lt smells like
you pounded garbage into your butt.

16:33.006 --> 16:36.508
Knock it off!
We have a mystery in our bathroom.

16:36.509 --> 16:39.745
Query. Can flames
come out of a toilet?

16:39.746 --> 16:42.280
- Hank, if you did this...
- l didn't.

16:42.281 --> 16:45.884
Dude, if l did this, l would tell you.
l would be, like, almost proud of this.

16:45.885 --> 16:48.653
You guys have been
in there for, like, an hour.

16:48.654 --> 16:50.589
What are you doing in th--

16:50.590 --> 16:52.657
Hank, what is wrong with you?

16:52.658 --> 16:55.160
Right? lt smells like
a Bible story in here.

16:55.161 --> 16:57.362
Did my grandpa teach you to crap?

16:57.363 --> 16:58.764
We should get Brock.

16:58.765 --> 17:01.466
Every time there's
a super cool mystery to solve...

17:01.467 --> 17:04.060
you go get a grownup. Lame!

17:04.103 --> 17:05.237
Thank you, Brock.

17:05.238 --> 17:08.707
Thanks for helping me
with the walking eye.

17:08.708 --> 17:11.608
Look at this walking eye.

17:11.644 --> 17:15.513
lt's filthy.
Guess l should wash off my...

17:15.515 --> 17:18.015
walking eye.

17:30.496 --> 17:33.565
- Well, just retrace your steps.
- Yeah. Retrace your...

17:33.566 --> 17:35.434
Man, she is good.

17:35.435 --> 17:37.002
l was standing out here...

17:37.003 --> 17:40.172
and l think somebody
was on the toilet.

17:40.173 --> 17:43.631
Then l opened the door.

17:43.676 --> 17:46.144
- l killed your girlfriend!
- She's my girlfriend?

17:46.145 --> 17:48.845
Probably, before l killed her.

17:49.382 --> 17:51.550
Why is he doing this?

17:51.551 --> 17:56.352
''Down, still unceasingly,
still inevitably down!

17:56.389 --> 17:59.057
''Still l quivered in every nerve...

17:59.058 --> 18:02.160
''to think how slight
a sinking of the machinery...

18:02.161 --> 18:07.621
''would precipitate the keen,
glistening axe upon my bosom.''

18:08.134 --> 18:10.836
l could chase that around. Oh, yeah.

18:10.837 --> 18:14.106
Team of three, impressive resume,
you seem perfect.

18:14.107 --> 18:16.408
But l can't stop thinking
that l know you, Miss...

18:16.409 --> 18:18.944
- Au Pair. lt's Lady Au Pair.
- Goodness Gracious.

18:18.945 --> 18:20.846
- Oh, my...
- Feminine.

18:20.847 --> 18:23.849
And these are my Murderous Moppets
and you don't know me.

18:23.850 --> 18:26.685
That's a voice! Do you smoke
cigarettes or do you eat them?

18:26.686 --> 18:30.188
Oh, forget it. All right. l'm...
Good-bye.

18:30.189 --> 18:31.890
Anybody want a moppet?

18:31.891 --> 18:34.459
- We have to get Dr. O.
- Yeah. Good plan.

18:34.460 --> 18:38.630
''Oh, hey, 'sup, Dr. O.?
So, yeah, we...accidentally killed Triana.''

18:38.631 --> 18:41.233
Come on, Dean.
We have to do this.

18:41.234 --> 18:43.502
You're right.
List our clues again.

18:43.503 --> 18:46.404
One, goth chick
catches fire and disappears.

18:46.405 --> 18:50.075
Two, no smoldering body beating
''kill me, kill me'' in Morse code...

18:50.076 --> 18:52.244
- ...with what is left of her head.
- Stop it!

18:52.245 --> 18:55.881
Three, the smell of a dumpster
full of burning diapers.

18:55.882 --> 18:57.516
- And four...
- Wait a minute.

18:57.517 --> 19:00.714
Run the shower and only the hot.

19:05.258 --> 19:07.592
- Just as l thought!
- You're a genius.

19:07.593 --> 19:09.794
- lt's Triana's handwriting.
- How can you tell?

19:09.795 --> 19:13.031
She dotted her ''i'' with a big circle.
That's a total chick move.

19:13.032 --> 19:18.937
lt says, ''l'm in the torrid zone.
Tell my feather.''

19:18.971 --> 19:20.805
We have to find her feather!

19:20.806 --> 19:24.242
Give it up already.
You could take a bus.

19:24.243 --> 19:28.146
Dude, Jet Boy and Jet Girl
do not take buses.

19:28.147 --> 19:31.316
Last time, we are not
Jet Boy and Jet Girl.

19:31.317 --> 19:34.653
l don't care if l get to be Jet Boy.
Those names suck.

19:34.654 --> 19:37.656
But it's a French song,
street cred with the indie crowd.

19:37.657 --> 19:39.324
The Damned do a cover of it.

19:39.325 --> 19:42.994
Then we should be The Damned.
That is a way cooler name.

19:42.995 --> 19:45.664
You may sit down,
if you would be more comfort...

19:45.665 --> 19:49.167
l shall stand.
Sitting is for the weak and feeble.

19:49.168 --> 19:51.303
l like this guy.
He's all full of...

19:51.304 --> 19:54.072
- What? l feel like standing.
- ...full of beans...

19:54.073 --> 19:57.642
- l happen to have back pain.
- ...and ants, fire ants.

19:57.643 --> 20:03.048
So, what kind of...menace do you think
you could offer the Order of the Triad?

20:03.049 --> 20:06.985
- l've kidnapped your daughter.
- Balls, brass balls.

20:06.986 --> 20:10.422
You kidnapped my pumpkin!

20:10.456 --> 20:14.659
- We have a winner.
- The guy is not even a Blackula.

20:14.660 --> 20:17.495
Right. That eye
is crawling with villains.

20:17.496 --> 20:21.566
Yeah. They gave up on Orpheus
and his little kaffeeklatsch.

20:21.567 --> 20:24.803
Oh, they know a real archrival
when they see one.

20:24.804 --> 20:26.972
- You want a sandwich?
- No. l ate already.

20:26.973 --> 20:30.742
You...want me to rescue it
or something, pull them off it?

20:30.743 --> 20:33.612
There's Guild Security out there
shooting foam at them.

20:33.613 --> 20:36.681
Between you and me,
the stupid thing hardly worked, anyway.

20:36.682 --> 20:40.085
But when word of this gets out,
business will pick right up.

20:40.086 --> 20:42.887
Well, l'm gonna go out there
and get some of that action.

20:42.888 --> 20:44.856
- Don't you want to change?
- No way.

20:44.857 --> 20:50.562
l love wearing a tux when l kill guys.
Makes you kind of feel like James Bond.

20:50.563 --> 20:52.897
So, who's the lucky winner?

20:52.898 --> 20:56.334
A fetid little firebrand
named Torrid.

20:56.335 --> 20:59.571
Yeah. The son of a bitch kidnapped
his daughter to the torrid zone.

20:59.572 --> 21:02.473
Torrid zone. So butch!

21:02.508 --> 21:04.876
- l solved that mystery.
- Yes, you did.

21:04.877 --> 21:08.580
You see, the torrid zone
is merely the area between...

21:08.581 --> 21:11.750
the Tropic of Cancer
and the Tropic of Capricorn.

21:11.751 --> 21:16.415
l own an island there
in the Great Barrier Reef.

21:16.455 --> 21:18.857
So, Triana is safe
on Orpheus lsland...

21:18.858 --> 21:21.393
sunning herself in a bikini...

21:21.394 --> 21:26.354
and oiling her ski--
her skin down in her bikini.

21:26.399 --> 21:29.134
Dude, what the...?
What are you doing up there?

21:29.135 --> 21:32.195
OK. Time to get off my shoulders.

21:32.238 --> 21:37.642
l just want to commend you...
on accepting Hank for who he really is.

21:37.643 --> 21:40.683
Let's show Mr. Venture our thing.

21:42.048 --> 21:45.506
The Order of the Triad, go!

21:45.551 --> 21:48.051
Get out of my kitchen.

22:14.313 --> 22:17.113
We can still do this, Jet Boy.

22:17.116 --> 22:20.576
l can't hear you
because l hate you.

22:22.922 --> 22:25.422
You coming, Jet Girl?

22:26.459 --> 22:28.959
No! No! Not again!

22:30.229 --> 22:32.964
l can't believe that
whore stole my stanza.

22:32.965 --> 22:35.700
l can't believe that whore
made it through the Lake of Acid.

22:35.701 --> 22:38.636
Ca c'est une bonne soupe!
