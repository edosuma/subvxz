WEBVTT

00:05.300 --> 00:08.267
- HEY, COULD YOU
PASS THE SALT?

00:08.267 --> 00:11.900
- [shocked]
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

00:11.900 --> 00:14.333
- I WANT TO PUT SOME SALT
ON THIS.

00:14.333 --> 00:17.100
- IN 47 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,

00:17.100 --> 00:19.433
YOU'VE NEVER SALTED
MY LASAGNA.

00:19.433 --> 00:23.633
- MARIE, IT'S BAD ENOUGH
IT NEEDS IT...

00:23.633 --> 00:26.700
YOU GOT TO REMIND ME
HOW LONG WE'VE BEEN MARRIED?

00:28.067 --> 00:30.200
- THAT DOESN'T NEED SALT.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.167
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT, FRANK?
YOU MAD AT ME?

00:34.167 --> 00:36.233
- NO, I JUST WANT THE SALT.

00:36.233 --> 00:38.500
- BALONEY; IT'S BECAUSE
I YELLED AT YOU LAST NIGHT

00:38.500 --> 00:42.767
FOR BLOWING YOUR NOSE
INTO YOUR SOCK, ISN'T IT?

00:42.767 --> 00:49.067
- NO, ALL I'M SAYING IS,
THIS IS NOT DOIN' IT FOR ME.

00:49.067 --> 00:51.933
- OH. WELL,
THEN BY ALL MEANS,

00:51.933 --> 00:53.833
HAVE THE SALT.

00:53.833 --> 00:56.500
- THANK YOU.
- MM-HMM.

01:05.900 --> 01:09.333
- PASS THE SALT!

01:09.333 --> 01:11.200
THE LIST OF THINGS
I'M ALLOWED TO SAY

01:11.200 --> 01:14.267
IS GETTING SHORTER!

01:19.767 --> 01:21.133
- HI.
- HI.

01:21.133 --> 01:22.600
- HEY.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.467
- HELLO.
- HEY.

01:23.467 --> 01:25.467
- MM-MM, WHAT'S FOR BRUNCH?

01:25.467 --> 01:27.500
- WELL, I MADE PASTA
WITH PESTO SAUCE,

01:27.500 --> 01:30.200
CHICKEN SAUSAGES,
PORK SAUSAGES,

01:30.200 --> 01:31.267
EGGPLANT CURRY,

01:31.267 --> 01:32.767
WALDORF SALAD,

01:32.767 --> 01:35.633
AND MINI QUICHES WITH HAM
FOR HORS D'OEUVRES.

01:35.633 --> 01:36.833
- WHAT, HALF DAY TODAY?

01:36.833 --> 01:39.100
WHAT'S UP?

01:39.100 --> 01:40.333
- I MADE FRITTATA.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.700
- WELL, GOOD FOR YOU, DEAR.

01:44.833 --> 01:47.600
- TASTE THIS PESTO, RAYMOND.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.833
- MMM! OH! PERFECT.

01:49.833 --> 01:52.167
- REALLY? YOU LIKE IT?

01:52.167 --> 01:53.267
- YEAH. OF COURSE.

01:53.267 --> 01:54.767
- I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

01:54.767 --> 01:57.300
LAST NIGHT YOUR FATHER
TOLD ME MY LASAGNA NEEDED SALT.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.367
- WHAT?
- COME ON.

01:59.367 --> 02:05.167
- HOW DARE SOMEONE CRITICIZE
ANOTHER PERSON'S COOKING?

02:06.267 --> 02:08.667
- WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT,

02:08.667 --> 02:11.333
ALL GREAT ARTISTS
MUST FACE THE FACT

02:11.333 --> 02:14.367
THAT SOMEDAY
THEIR GIFTS WILL FADE.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.000
- MA, COME ON,
YOUR GIFTS AREN'T FADING.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.700
HUH?
YOU THE MAN.

02:21.533 --> 02:24.167
- YOU KNOW, YOUR FATHER
USED TO SALIVATE OVER MY MEALS.

02:24.167 --> 02:27.033
BUT LATELY, IT'S LIKE HE'S JUST
GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS.

02:27.033 --> 02:29.133
- MA, MA, MA,
YOU STILL GOT IT.

02:29.133 --> 02:31.667
YOU'RE THE PAVAROTTI OF PESTO.

02:34.067 --> 02:35.967
- THAT'S A SWEET BOY.

02:35.967 --> 02:38.133
NOTHING LIKE HIS FATHER.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.367
- HEY, DAD, WHAT ARE YOU
BUSTIN' MOM'S HUMP

02:41.367 --> 02:42.567
ABOUT THE LASAGNA FOR?

02:42.567 --> 02:44.700
- I WISH IT WAS
JUST THE LASAGNA.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.167
HAVE YOU TRIED
THESE LITTLE QUICHES SHE MADE?

02:47.167 --> 02:51.300
I'VE HAD BELLY LINT
WITH MORE FLAVOR.

02:54.033 --> 02:55.367
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT,
DAD?

02:55.367 --> 02:56.933
THESE ARE FANTASTIC.

02:56.933 --> 02:59.200
- YEAH.
I LIKE TABASCO ON MINE.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.100
ALL RIGHT. TRY THAT.

03:04.733 --> 03:07.133
- TASTELESS.

03:08.333 --> 03:09.867
- WELL, THAT TABASCO'S
GOT NO KICK.

03:09.867 --> 03:13.500
THIS BOTTLE WAS ISSUED TO DAD
DURING THE KOREAN WAR.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.033
- HOLD ON.

03:17.033 --> 03:18.267
- YOU KNOW, DAD,

03:18.267 --> 03:20.333
I HAVE TO SAY
THAT I AM SURPRISED

03:20.333 --> 03:24.267
THAT YOU CANNOT APPRECIATE
THE INTERPLAY OF THESE FLAVORS,

03:24.267 --> 03:26.933
THE SMOKINESS OF THE HAM

03:26.933 --> 03:28.333
DELICATELY CONTRASTING

03:28.333 --> 03:30.733
WITH THE SWEETNESS
OF THE EGG CUSTARD.

03:30.733 --> 03:35.633
- WHY DON'T YOU PUT ON A DRESS
AND DO A DANCE?

03:42.900 --> 03:44.200
- HEY, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

03:44.200 --> 03:46.167
- I GOT MARCO'S HOT PEPPERS,

03:46.167 --> 03:48.233
I GOT HOT MUSTARD
FROM WO HOP'S,

03:48.233 --> 03:50.133
EVERYTHING
FROM MA'S ETHNIC SHELF.

03:50.133 --> 03:54.100
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD; LET'S START
WITH THE HORSERADISH, HERE.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.233
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

03:56.233 --> 03:59.100
WASABI. I GOT WASABI.

03:59.100 --> 04:02.100
AH, AND HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE JALAPEÑO?

04:02.100 --> 04:03.567
- YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.

04:03.567 --> 04:06.333
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.500
- HERE YOU GO, DAD.
WHY DON'T YOU TRY THAT ONE?

04:09.500 --> 04:12.000
- OKAY, BUT I'M TELLIN' YOU...

04:14.833 --> 04:16.667
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.

04:16.667 --> 04:21.200
- DAD, THAT HAD HORSERADISH,
WASABI, AND JALAPEÑO ON IT!

04:21.200 --> 04:22.367
- IT DID?

04:22.367 --> 04:25.167
- HOW CAN YOU NOT TASTE THAT?

04:34.867 --> 04:37.767
[screams]

04:40.833 --> 04:44.133
- OH, MY GOD.
DAD, YOU'VE GOT NO TASTE!

04:44.133 --> 04:45.833
- HOLY CRAP!

04:45.833 --> 04:49.800
- AAAGGHH!

04:49.800 --> 04:52.333
- AND THIS WHOLE TIME,
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOUR MOTHER.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.500
- AAAAH!

04:56.167 --> 04:58.167
- ROBBIE!

05:01.800 --> 05:04.433
- ROBERT, USE A GLASS.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.133
- OH, ROBBIE!
ROBBIE, PLEASE!

05:16.400 --> 05:19.533
YOU'LL SPOIL YOUR APPETITE.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.500
- I DON'T GET IT.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.433
HOW IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME?

05:25.433 --> 05:28.667
- MAYBE YOUR SINUSES
ARE STUFFED UP.

05:28.667 --> 05:32.433
YOU KNOW, 90% OF TASTE
IS SMELL.

05:32.433 --> 05:35.567
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
WHY YOU DON'T SMELL...

05:35.567 --> 05:37.067
YOU.

05:41.700 --> 05:45.367
- NAH, I CAN SMELL ME.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.533
I JUST DON'T MIND ME.

05:51.733 --> 05:53.533
- HEY, WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

05:53.533 --> 05:55.400
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE.

05:55.400 --> 05:59.000
- [hoarsely] I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.667
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

06:00.667 --> 06:03.133
WHEN DID YOU START NOTICING
THAT MA'S COOKING WAS SLIPPING?

06:03.133 --> 06:06.600
- I DON'T KNOW.
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.667
- WELL, HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
ANYTHING DIFFERENT

06:08.667 --> 06:09.733
IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS?

06:09.733 --> 06:11.300
- I HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENT

06:11.300 --> 06:14.033
IN THE LAST 50 YEARS.

06:14.033 --> 06:16.600
UH, WELL...

06:16.600 --> 06:18.567
EXCEPT--

06:18.567 --> 06:19.600
- WHAT?

06:19.600 --> 06:22.333
- I HAVE BEEN
TAKING THESE PILLS.

06:22.333 --> 06:26.033
- WHAT, FOR, LIKE,
BLOOD PRESSURE OR SOMETHING?

06:26.033 --> 06:29.500
- NAH, JUST SOME HERB PILLS
THAT STAN AND GARVIN GAVE ME.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.167
- STAN AND GARVIN?
WHAT FOR?

06:33.367 --> 06:37.033
- THEY'RE FOR MY, UH...
FOOT.

06:37.033 --> 06:38.833
- YOUR FOOT?

06:38.833 --> 06:40.100
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,

06:40.100 --> 06:43.067
MY FOOT.

06:55.100 --> 06:58.233
- "LANCELOT"?

07:05.667 --> 07:08.433
- "POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS:
HEADACHES, STOMACH CRAMPING"--

07:08.433 --> 07:12.400
OH, GOD, DAD, LOOK AT THIS--
"LOSS OF TASTE."

07:12.400 --> 07:13.700
- HEY, YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.367
- WELL, DIDN'T YOU READ
THE LABEL?

07:15.367 --> 07:19.733
- NO. MY EYES ARE
AS BAD AS MY FOOT.

07:21.533 --> 07:24.133
- DAD, I MEAN, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO STOP TAKING THOSE.

07:24.133 --> 07:27.400
- NO WAY!
THESE BABIES WORK!

07:27.400 --> 07:31.700
- HEY, UH, DAD,
DO YOU...REALLY NEED THOSE?

07:31.700 --> 07:34.333
- HEY, YOUR TIME WILL COME,
WISE GUY.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.333
I MIGHT NOT GET TO HIT
THAT OFTEN,

07:38.333 --> 07:40.667
BUT WHEN YOU'RE
CALLED TO THE PLATE,

07:40.667 --> 07:42.200
YOU BETTER BRING A BAT.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.200
- AAAHHH!

07:51.033 --> 07:53.200
YEAH, OKAY, OKAY.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.333
- BRUNCH TIME.

07:54.333 --> 07:57.233
- OH. ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

07:58.433 --> 07:59.800
- HEY, LISTEN,
YOU TWO KNUCKLEHEADS.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.067
YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT THESE PILLS,

08:01.067 --> 08:02.767
SO KEEP YOUR TRAPS SHUT.

08:02.767 --> 08:05.167
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WHEN
SHE FINDS OUT YOU CAN'T TASTE?

08:05.167 --> 08:06.967
- SHE'S NOT GONNA FIND OUT.

08:06.967 --> 08:09.333
TASTE I CAN FAKE.

08:13.033 --> 08:14.367
- OKAY.

08:14.367 --> 08:16.667
- HEY, KIDS! COME ON
AND GET YOUR FOOD.

08:16.667 --> 08:17.967
HERE YOU GO.

08:17.967 --> 08:19.100
- LOOKS MARVELOUS.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.400
- THANK YOU, HONEY.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.567
- EVERYTHING LOOKS
DELICIOUS, MARIE.

08:22.567 --> 08:25.233
- THANKS, FRANK.
HERE YOU GO.

08:25.233 --> 08:27.133
- CAN'T WAIT.

08:34.833 --> 08:37.800
MMM!

08:37.800 --> 08:39.333
MMM!

08:39.333 --> 08:41.367
FANTASTIC, MARIE.

08:41.367 --> 08:44.300
- REALLY?
OH, I'M SO GLAD.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.833
- SO CAN YOU BELIEVE?
SPRING TRAINING ALREADY.

08:47.833 --> 08:51.000
- YEAH, FIRST DAY TOMORROW,
PITCHERS AND CATCHERS.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.533
- HERE, FRANK.
TRY THE FRITTATA.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.233
- BRING IT ON!

09:00.000 --> 09:02.600
MMM!

09:02.600 --> 09:04.333
OH!

09:04.333 --> 09:06.200
WOW, THAT'S GOOD!

09:06.200 --> 09:08.733
- NO, IT'S NOT!
THAT'S DEBRA'S!

09:12.900 --> 09:14.167
- WHOOPS.

09:14.167 --> 09:15.533
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:15.533 --> 09:17.400
FIRST YOU TELL ME
MY LASAGNA NEEDS SALT,

09:17.400 --> 09:19.733
AND NOW DEBRA'S FRITTATA
IS GOOD.

09:19.733 --> 09:22.833
"OH! WOWEE! OOH!"

09:22.833 --> 09:25.467
IS THIS SOME KIND OF A SCHEME

09:25.467 --> 09:27.533
TO FINALLY DRIVE ME INSANE?

09:27.533 --> 09:29.600
- NO!
- THEN WHY ARE YOU TORTURING ME?

09:29.600 --> 09:32.100
- I'M NOT TORTURING YOU!
- THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:32.100 --> 09:34.167
- I CAN'T TASTE!
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:34.167 --> 09:36.933
- I'VE LOST MY SENSE OF TASTE.
- ARE YOU SICK?

09:36.933 --> 09:38.033
- NO!
- WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW?

09:38.033 --> 09:39.800
DID YOU GO TO A DOCTOR?

09:39.800 --> 09:41.733
- I'M NOT GOING TO A DOCTOR.
I'M JUST GETTING OLDER, OKAY?

09:41.733 --> 09:43.800
- SO YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TRY TO FIX IT?

09:43.800 --> 09:45.167
- LEAVE ME ALONE!

09:45.167 --> 09:47.300
- OH, THAT'S FINE:
"LEAVE ME ALONE."

09:47.300 --> 09:48.767
- I'LL LIVE WITH IT, OKAY?

09:48.767 --> 09:50.567
- OH, THAT'S IT--
"I'LL LIVE WITH IT."

09:50.567 --> 09:52.600
- MA, NOW YOU KNOW THAT
IT'S NOT YOUR COOKING, RIGHT?

09:52.600 --> 09:55.133
YOU STILL GOT IT!
SO NOW YOU CAN BE HAPPY AGAIN.

09:55.133 --> 09:57.100
- HAPPY?
HOW CAN I BE HAPPY?

09:57.100 --> 10:00.500
I'M REMBRANDT,
AND HE'S BLIND!

10:05.933 --> 10:07.500
- WELL, DEB,

10:07.500 --> 10:10.333
AT LEAST SOMEBODY
LIKED YOUR FRITTATA.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.233
- HEY!
- HEY, GUYS.

10:22.233 --> 10:24.267
OKAY, RAY, AMY AND I
ARE GOING TO THE MALL.

10:24.267 --> 10:26.433
HEY, RAY, YOU MIND IF
I WATCH THE GAME OVER HERE?

10:26.433 --> 10:28.600
EVER SINCE SUNDAY BRUNCH,
MOM'S BEEN ALL DEPRESSED.

10:28.600 --> 10:32.167
SHE'S JUST SITTING IN FRONT
OF THE TV, EATING DONUTS.

10:32.167 --> 10:33.667
- WHAT, DID DAD JUST
GIVE UP THE REMOTE?

10:33.667 --> 10:37.400
- DIDN'T EVEN
PUT UP A FIGHT.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.133
- SINCE THIS WHOLE THING,

10:39.133 --> 10:40.767
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN
FIGHTING AT ALL.

10:40.767 --> 10:44.200
I MISS THE YELLING.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.833
- I MISS MA'S COOKING.

10:45.833 --> 10:48.567
SHE HASN'T COOKED ANYTHING
IN THREE DAYS.

10:48.567 --> 10:49.767
- THIS IS CRAZY.

10:49.767 --> 10:52.567
EVERYTHING'S FALLING APART
BECAUSE OF FOOD?

10:52.567 --> 10:53.667
IT'S JUST FOOD.

10:53.667 --> 10:56.167
YOU CAN'T BASE
A MARRIAGE ON FOOD.

10:56.167 --> 10:59.033
- WELL, YOU AND I CAN'T.

11:01.767 --> 11:03.400
- I CAN'T BELIEVE MARIE.

11:03.400 --> 11:07.200
FRANK CAN'T HELP IT
IF HIS TONGUE IS GETTING OLD.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.067
- WHY CAN'T SHE BE
MORE SENSITIVE?

11:10.067 --> 11:12.367
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED IF THIS WHOLE THING

11:12.367 --> 11:14.300
WAS HER FAULT TO BEGIN WITH.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.367
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:15.367 --> 11:16.867
- WELL, I MEAN, WHO'S TO SAY

11:16.867 --> 11:18.367
THAT AFTER 47 YEARS

11:18.367 --> 11:20.567
OF MARIE'S CONSTANT
CRITICISM AND NAGGING,

11:20.567 --> 11:23.267
FRANK JUST COULDN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE?

11:23.267 --> 11:25.600
AND HIS LOSING HIS TASTE

11:25.600 --> 11:28.400
IS A PSYCHOSOMATIC WAY
OF NOT LISTENING.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.167
HE IS TUNING HER OUT
WITH HIS TONGUE.

11:31.167 --> 11:34.900
- WOW! YEAH! YEAH!

11:34.900 --> 11:37.067
THAT MAKES SENSE!
- YEAH, HUH?

11:37.067 --> 11:39.833
NOBODY EVER STANDS UP
TO THIS WOMAN.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.400
RAY, GET OVER THERE.

11:42.533 --> 11:43.800
- WHAT?

11:43.800 --> 11:46.367
- GO. GO TELL YOUR MOTHER
THIS IS ALL HER FAULT.

11:46.367 --> 11:48.367
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, OKAY?

11:48.367 --> 11:51.467
- I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED
OF YOUR MOMMY.

11:51.467 --> 11:53.033
- YEAH, YEAH,
IT'S NOT MY MOMMY, OKAY?

11:53.033 --> 11:54.600
DAD LOST HIS TASTE

11:54.600 --> 11:56.800
BECAUSE OF SOME PILLS
HE'S TAKING FOR HIS...FOOT.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.267
- RAY!

11:58.267 --> 11:59.600
- SORRY, MAN.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.867
I HATE IT WHEN SHE THINKS
SHE KNOWS STUFF.

12:02.867 --> 12:04.167
- HIS FOOT?

12:04.167 --> 12:05.700
- THAT'S RIGHT, PROFESSOR.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.567
SO WHY DON'T YOU TWO
JUST RUN ALONG TO THE MALL

12:07.567 --> 12:11.200
BEFORE THEY'RE ALL OUT OF
KNICK-KNACKS AND PADDYWACKS?

12:15.167 --> 12:17.500
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T HE JUST
TELL MARIE THAT?

12:17.500 --> 12:21.967
- BECAUSE HE'S VERY
SENSITIVE ABOUT HIS FOOT.

12:21.967 --> 12:26.133
- OH. SO BY FOOT,
YOU MEAN...

12:26.133 --> 12:30.633
NOT HIS FOOT.

12:30.633 --> 12:33.667
- GO TO THE MALL.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.600
- WELL, THEN WHAT ARE
THE PILLS FOR?

12:39.900 --> 12:43.667
OHH.

12:43.667 --> 12:46.100
THAT FOOT.

12:51.467 --> 12:53.700
- YOU KNOW, THIS IS CRAZY.

12:53.700 --> 12:56.233
I MEAN, MARIE SHOULD
KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.833
- OF COURSE.
SOMEBODY SHOULD TELL HER.

12:57.833 --> 13:00.600
- NO! NO! IT'S NOT
GONNA BE ANY OF US, OKAY?

13:00.600 --> 13:05.867
THIS IS BETWEEN A MAN
AND HIS PODIATRIST!

13:05.867 --> 13:08.367
- BUT HOW ARE FRANK AND MARIE
GONNA GET THROUGH THIS IF THEY--

13:08.367 --> 13:10.567
- NO! WE TOLD DAD
WE WOULD KEEP THIS A SECRET,

13:10.567 --> 13:12.833
AND I ABSOLUTELY FORBID YOU
TO SAY ANY OF THIS TO MOM.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.133
DO YOU GOT IT?

13:17.633 --> 13:19.733
BOO-BOO?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.867
- LOOK, LOOK,

13:22.867 --> 13:24.333
LET ME JUST SAY THIS.

13:24.333 --> 13:28.100
WHEN IT COMES TO A MAN
AND HIS WIFE,

13:28.100 --> 13:31.767
A MAN NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT HE'S A MAN...

13:31.767 --> 13:35.667
WHETHER OR NOT HIS WIFE
KNOWS HE'S A MAN OR NOT.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.033
- WHAT ELSE DOES DAD HAVE?

13:41.333 --> 13:43.267
- WELL, I NEVER
THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT.

13:43.267 --> 13:46.267
- I GUESS WE SHOULD
STAY OUT OF IT.

13:46.267 --> 13:49.600
- OKAY, SO WE WON'T
SAY ANYTHING TO MARIE.

13:50.867 --> 13:52.133
- HI, FRANK.

14:06.133 --> 14:07.800
- LISTEN, FRANK...

14:07.800 --> 14:10.000
CAN WE TALK?

14:14.600 --> 14:15.867
SO HOW ARE YOU?

14:15.867 --> 14:18.567
- YES, HOW ARE YOU?

14:18.567 --> 14:19.567
- FINE.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.067
- ISN'T THIS NICE?

14:25.067 --> 14:26.433
I MEAN, HOW OFTEN
DO WE GET THE CHANCE

14:26.433 --> 14:28.233
TO TALK TOGETHER,
JUST THE THREE OF US?

14:28.233 --> 14:29.733
- THAT IS SO TRUE.

14:29.733 --> 14:31.500
YOU KNOW, DEB,
I THINK IT IS SO FUNNY

14:31.500 --> 14:33.233
HOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE
CAN LIVE SO CLOSE...

14:33.233 --> 14:35.333
- AND NEVER TAKE THE TIME
TO JUST SIT DOWN AND...

14:35.333 --> 14:36.733
- SHOOT THE BREEZE.

14:36.733 --> 14:38.733
- YEAH, COMMUNICATION
IS SO IMPORTANT, AMY.

14:38.733 --> 14:40.567
- OH, I AGREE.
- YEAH.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.533
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO MAGPIES
SQUAWKING ABOUT?

14:47.867 --> 14:50.133
- LOOK, FRANK, ABOUT YOUR...

14:50.133 --> 14:51.867
PROBLEM...

14:51.867 --> 14:53.100
- YEAH? DON'T WORRY.

14:53.100 --> 14:57.067
I GOT NO TASTE,
BUT I STILL GOT CRUNCH.

14:58.167 --> 15:01.500
- NO, WE MEAN
THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR...

15:01.500 --> 15:03.600
- FOOT.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.333
- WHAT?

15:05.333 --> 15:08.700
- WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS IS
NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

15:08.700 --> 15:12.767
- YEAH, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT RAY.

15:15.867 --> 15:17.533
HE MIGHT TALK A BIG GAME,

15:17.533 --> 15:21.267
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES
WHEN HE CAN'T ALWAYS...

15:21.267 --> 15:24.000
PUT HIS BEST FOOT FORWARD.

15:26.867 --> 15:30.733
AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE WAY
I FEEL ABOUT HIM AT ALL.

15:30.733 --> 15:32.467
- YEAH, WE LOVE OUR FELLAS

15:32.467 --> 15:36.133
NO MATTER WHAT THEY'RE ABLE
OR UNABLE TO DO.

15:37.533 --> 15:38.600
- FRANK, LISTEN.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.433
WHEN WE HEARD
ABOUT YOUR SITUATION,

15:40.433 --> 15:42.733
THAT DIDN'T MAKE US
THINK BADLY OF YOU.

15:42.733 --> 15:46.567
WE STILL THINK OF YOU
AS BIG, STRONG, VIRILE FRANK.

15:46.567 --> 15:48.633
- FRRRANK!

15:51.233 --> 15:53.233
- AND YOU KNOW,
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY

15:53.233 --> 15:55.400
MARIE COULD EVER SEE YOU TOO.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.533
SO YOU SHOULD REALLY
GO TALK TO HER ABOUT THIS

15:57.533 --> 15:59.267
SO YOU CAN WORK THIS OUT
TOGETHER.

15:59.267 --> 16:01.300
- YEAH, IF YOU WANT
TO IMPRESS MARIE,

16:01.300 --> 16:03.200
YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.667
[manly]
TALK!

16:07.333 --> 16:09.867
- WHAT'S THIS?

16:09.867 --> 16:11.367
- OH, HI, MARIE.

16:11.367 --> 16:13.167
- WE'RE JUST HAVING
A LITTLE CHAT WITH FRANK.

16:13.167 --> 16:15.367
- YEP, JUST CHEWING THE FAT
AND SOME CELERY.

16:17.867 --> 16:20.733
- SO, FRANK, YOU THINK THE METS
ARE GONNA TAKE IT THIS YEAR?

16:20.733 --> 16:22.167
- OH, I CERTAINLY HOPE THEY CAN.

16:22.167 --> 16:24.533
THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING
THEIR LITTLE HEARTS OUT.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.167
- I'M JUST GONNA
GET MY LUNCH,

16:30.167 --> 16:33.167
AND I'LL BE
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

16:39.667 --> 16:42.067
- I THINK SHE'S READY
TO HEAR YOU.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.133
- YEAH, WHAT DO YOU SAY,
FRANK?

16:45.333 --> 16:48.733
- YOUR HUSBANDS
ARE DEAD MEN.

16:53.933 --> 16:55.700
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:55.700 --> 16:56.767
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:56.767 --> 16:58.167
- AT MY HOUSE.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.700
I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOUR WIVES
ARE OVER THERE

16:59.700 --> 17:00.700
TALKING TO YOUR FATHER.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.333
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

17:02.333 --> 17:03.967
- I MEAN, NOBODY TALKS
TO YOUR FATHER,

17:03.967 --> 17:06.967
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE.

17:06.967 --> 17:08.933
- [growls]
YOUR WIFE.

17:08.933 --> 17:11.100
- YOUR WIFE.

17:11.100 --> 17:12.733
- SO IS EVERYONE
TURNING AGAINST ME?

17:12.733 --> 17:14.167
IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:14.167 --> 17:16.400
I DON'T MAKE LASAGNA
FOR THREE DAYS,

17:16.400 --> 17:18.433
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
NOBODY CARES ABOUT ME.

17:18.433 --> 17:20.267
EVERYBODY IS FRANK'S FRIEND.

17:20.267 --> 17:22.567
- NO, MA,
THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL.

17:22.567 --> 17:24.400
- WELL, WHAT ELSE
COULD IT BE?

17:24.400 --> 17:26.833
COOKING IS ALL I'M GOOD FOR,
ISN'T IT?

17:26.833 --> 17:28.533
OH, YES,
I RAISED TWO BOYS

17:28.533 --> 17:30.700
WITH PRECIOUS LITTLE HELP
FROM YOUR FATHER.

17:30.700 --> 17:33.733
AND, YES, MY CHARITY WORK
HAS BENEFITED

17:33.733 --> 17:35.767
COUNTLESS PEOPLE
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.

17:35.767 --> 17:38.967
BUT APPARENTLY IF ANYBODY
LOOKS AT THIS FACE,

17:38.967 --> 17:41.633
ALL THEY SEE IS
A FRYING PAN.

17:43.333 --> 17:46.233
- I DON'T SEE
A FRYING PAN, MA.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.800
I SEE A WOMAN
WHO DESERVES THE TRUTH.

17:49.800 --> 17:53.000
- DON'T BE STUPID.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.567
- LOOK...

17:54.567 --> 17:55.800
LOOK, MA,

17:55.800 --> 17:58.633
HIS LOSS OF TASTE
IS BECAUSE OF A SIDE EFFECT

17:58.633 --> 18:02.067
THAT HE GOT BECAUSE OF
THESE PILLS THAT HE'S TAKING.

18:02.067 --> 18:03.600
- WHAT? PILLS?

18:03.600 --> 18:08.167
- YEAH, THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO RESTORE HIS...

18:08.167 --> 18:09.500
- HAIR?
- YES.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.533
- NO.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.933
HIS...
- MEMORY?

18:15.933 --> 18:18.233
- YES.
- NO!

18:19.367 --> 18:22.733
LOOK, IT'S--IT'S HIS...

18:26.233 --> 18:29.533
KEEP GUESSING.

18:29.533 --> 18:30.867
- WHAT?

18:30.867 --> 18:32.667
- HIS MANHOOD, MA!

18:32.667 --> 18:36.267
HIS MANHOOD.

18:39.267 --> 18:42.667
- OH...WELL,
WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME?

18:42.667 --> 18:44.767
- BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
WANT TO BE ASHAMED

18:44.767 --> 18:49.000
AND THINK THAT YOU THOUGHT
HE WAS LESS OF A MAN.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.733
- HE HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
HIS TONGUE AND HIS MANHOOD.

18:56.233 --> 19:01.600
- OH...POOR FRANK.
I HAD NO IDEA.

19:02.800 --> 19:06.867
I'D RATHER HE COULD TASTE.

19:06.867 --> 19:09.167
- WELL, I MEAN, MA,
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

19:09.167 --> 19:10.933
- YES, IT IS.
I HAVE A SAY IN THIS.

19:10.933 --> 19:13.433
I'LL TAKE THE TASTE.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.500
- WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH YOU TWO?

19:16.500 --> 19:18.967
- NO, NO, DON'T BLAME US, OKAY?
BLAME THEM.

19:18.967 --> 19:22.067
- YOU SAID YOU WERE
GOING SHOPPING.

19:22.067 --> 19:25.467
- WE'LL GO SHOPPING
AFTER THIS.

19:25.467 --> 19:27.233
- ALL RIGHT, I WANT TO SEE
YOU TWO TRAITORS

19:27.233 --> 19:28.433
OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW!

19:28.433 --> 19:31.400
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, FRANK.
I KNOW.

19:31.400 --> 19:34.767
- IT'S LIES!
ALL LIES!

19:34.767 --> 19:37.333
- WAIT, WAIT! WAIT!

19:37.333 --> 19:39.667
HONEY, IT BREAKS MY HEART

19:39.667 --> 19:43.433
THAT YOU THINK THAT I MIGHT
NOT SEE YOU AS A MAN.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.433
AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW BY NOW

19:45.433 --> 19:50.167
THAT I COULDN'T POSSIBLY THINK
ANY LESS OF YOU.

19:58.100 --> 20:01.533
- THAT IS SO SWEET.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.333
- AND I APPRECIATE HOW
DIFFICULT IT MUST HAVE BEEN

20:04.333 --> 20:07.100
FOR YOU TO HAVE TO DECIDE
BETWEEN MY FOOD

20:07.100 --> 20:09.667
AND OUR PHYSICAL
RELATIONSHIP.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.700
- MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO SHOPPING NOW.

20:14.700 --> 20:16.167
- AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW

20:16.167 --> 20:17.833
THAT I'M TOUCHED

20:17.833 --> 20:20.267
THAT OUR YEARS IN THE BOUDOIR

20:20.267 --> 20:23.900
HAVE MEANT SO MUCH TO YOU.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.600
- WELL, THEY HAVE.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.700
BUT IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU,
I'D RATHER HAVE THE FOOD.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.233
- ME TOO!

20:31.233 --> 20:34.533
[both laughing]

20:39.633 --> 20:42.633
OH, FRANK.

20:42.633 --> 20:46.300
OH, FRANK,
I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY THAT.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.000
OH--

20:49.000 --> 20:52.167
OH, FRANK.

21:01.300 --> 21:06.333
I DON'T THINK
YOU NEED THOSE PILLS.

21:06.333 --> 21:11.000
- NO, THOSE ARE THE PILLS.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.767
- OH.

21:18.067 --> 21:19.467
HERE YOU GO, RAYMOND.

21:19.467 --> 21:20.867
- MA, I DON'T NEED THESE.

21:20.867 --> 21:24.233
- NO, NOT FOR THAT,
FOR DEBRA'S COOKING.
