WEBVTT

00:07.091 --> 00:08.426
The crop's ready.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.553
But the oil extraction process

00:10.594 --> 00:12.722
is taking longer than
we expected.

00:12.763 --> 00:13.848
How much longer?

00:13.889 --> 00:15.599
What we expected to
do in two days

00:15.641 --> 00:16.600
- will take us five.
- No, impossible.

00:18.269 --> 00:20.938
Ilana's contract says the order
has to reach Canada in two days.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.691
We're already behind.
We lost over ten plants.

00:23.733 --> 00:24.567
We lost?

00:25.651 --> 00:27.403
I was told you burned them.

00:27.445 --> 00:28.779
I had to burn them.

00:28.821 --> 00:30.114
You could've asked us, huh?

00:30.156 --> 00:31.657
Now you want me to ask you

00:31.699 --> 00:34.493
- about fertilizers?
- Stop, enough. Please.

00:35.411 --> 00:37.121
We're not here to argue.

00:37.163 --> 00:39.206
We should think like a team.

00:39.707 --> 00:40.583
What team?

00:46.464 --> 00:48.340
Could you give us a moment,
Gabriel?

00:48.382 --> 00:49.216
Of course.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.016
What'll we do about all this?

01:03.856 --> 01:04.940
We have to stop Lola.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.111
I was referring to Ilana.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.280
Stop?

01:11.322 --> 01:13.199
Yes. Stop.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.575
Now you'll kill everyone?

01:15.743 --> 01:17.578
Do you realize what
you're becoming?

01:17.620 --> 01:19.121
I'm not becoming anything,
Ignacio.

01:19.163 --> 01:20.956
I'm being cautious, that's all.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.500
Your caution made
you kill a guy.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.795
Now you want to do it
all over again.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.597
And what do you think?

01:39.350 --> 01:41.101
I want to go on with my life.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.691
If the journalist wants to
make it public, then so be it.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.695
I'm not afraid of
prison anymore.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.370
You two do whatever the
fuck you want.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.748
I'll make sure we ship
the order on time.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.758
You're doing what's right.

03:44.475 --> 03:45.851
Now how do I give it to him?

03:47.061 --> 03:48.354
Take it to him.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.526
It's a chance to see each other
and forgive each other.

03:54.568 --> 03:58.030
No, I can't.
I don't want to see him yet.

04:01.325 --> 04:02.993
I'll take it if you want.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.539
- Really?
- Yes.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.251
Tonight I'm having drinks
near his house.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.295
In the afternoon,

04:13.337 --> 04:16.382
I can stop by and deliver it.
Sound good?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.248
Who let you in here?

04:55.170 --> 04:57.840
I never understood
the whole fight against drugs.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.927
It's like fighting
against bad thoughts.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.681
People don't like thinking
about causing harm,

05:06.640 --> 05:08.767
but it's sort of inevitable.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.146
Don't worry. We'll pay
your money back.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.858
Changing the topic, Félix?

05:16.775 --> 05:18.819
I didn't know there was a topic.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.740
I'm talking about drugs

05:23.699 --> 05:25.951
and you're talking about debts.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.202
Aren't they the same?

05:27.828 --> 05:28.662
Similar,

05:31.081 --> 05:31.999
but not the same.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.126
I'll explain.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.755
Everything you have here

05:39.256 --> 05:40.966
is part of your debt to me,

05:42.968 --> 05:44.720
but it's not considered a drug.

05:46.472 --> 05:48.140
What you have here,

05:48.182 --> 05:49.558
in this place,

05:49.600 --> 05:51.727
with your permit, is
called medicine.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.147
So, what happens...

05:56.482 --> 05:57.232
if someone...

05:58.567 --> 06:00.778
decides to take
a couple of bags of cannabis,

06:01.653 --> 06:02.946
without anyone's permission,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.866
without their partners noticing?

06:05.908 --> 06:08.994
The medicine immediately stops
being medicine and becomes a drug.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.205
Isn't it funny?

06:12.539 --> 06:15.918
Inside, it's medicine,
and outside, it's a drug.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.878
And therefore a crime.

06:19.505 --> 06:22.007
A crime that could
destroy all this.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.052
See the difference now?

06:26.595 --> 06:27.262
What do you want from me?

06:28.514 --> 06:30.265
Nothing from you, Félix.
You're already mine.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.228
I don't need to come here
to get something from you.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.189
Then why are you here?

06:40.609 --> 06:43.153
Because I want every leaf
on these plants,

06:44.321 --> 06:45.948
I want each irrigation hose,

06:47.407 --> 06:49.785
I want each nutrient valve,
I want...

06:49.827 --> 06:53.622
those ultraviolet lights you
shine on the plants as they grow.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.501
I want what's inside,

06:57.543 --> 06:58.877
and what's outside.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.339
I want the medicine
and the drug.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.218
And I'm tired of waiting
for what I want.

07:07.511 --> 07:10.264
We still have a few days left
to pay you back.

07:10.305 --> 07:13.100
Not days, hours.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.937
67, to be exact.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.325
<i>Thank you for seeing me.</i>

07:30.367 --> 07:32.452
<i>You have some guts
to come see us</i>

07:32.494 --> 07:34.621
after your sabotage.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.915
Sabotage? No...

07:36.957 --> 07:39.001
I don't know where you
got that story.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.169
Story.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.087
If I wanted to fight,

07:42.129 --> 07:44.173
I assure you
I wouldn't have come this far.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.092
Okay, to what do we
owe this visit?

07:50.179 --> 07:53.015
In a couple of months,
there'll be a vote to determine

07:53.056 --> 07:55.726
if the bill to legalize
the use of recreational cannabis

07:55.767 --> 07:57.186
is passed or is rejected.

07:57.895 --> 08:01.940
I'm here to warn you the cannabis industry
will face a war like never before.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.650
If that bill fails,

08:04.651 --> 08:08.155
they'll also move to ban the one
that allows medicinal crops.

08:08.197 --> 08:10.782
That can't happen.
It's already approved.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.826
What country do you live in,
Mariana?

08:12.868 --> 08:14.995
Politicians here do
what they must.

08:16.496 --> 08:20.375
You know why politicians oppose
legalizing cannabis?

08:20.417 --> 08:23.545
They're all bought off
by the narcos.

08:23.587 --> 08:24.796
Exactly.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.425
All the moral speeches
are just a smoke screen.

08:28.467 --> 08:32.012
When they say recreational drugs
are the gateway to other drugs,

08:32.054 --> 08:35.265
or they affect the brain,
it's because, if it's legalized,

08:35.307 --> 08:36.767
the narcos' game falls apart.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.311
And the politicians' game
also falls apart.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.443
What do you want from us?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.696
To work together.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.490
This war will be hard.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.574
It's not our war.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.951
You can't choose your wars.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.328
We don't want any problems.
We're just starting out.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.831
Legalization of recreational cannabis
is a reality.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.875
Colombia isn't ready for
that discussion.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.877
Colombia's never ready
for anything.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.132
It's suicide.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.345
If this fails, you simply leave the
country, but we lose everything.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.516
We'll keep lobbying
for the bill.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.809
With or without you.

09:25.857 --> 09:31.363
Mariana, if my company had decided
to sabotage you,

09:31.405 --> 09:34.074
I assure you that you wouldn't have
realized it.

09:37.119 --> 09:38.078
Have a nice day.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.427
I have a doctor's appointment
in 30 minutes. Can you come?

09:53.468 --> 09:56.471
I need to rest.
I've been working all night.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.224
But can you come with me?

09:59.266 --> 10:00.142
Why?

10:01.184 --> 10:02.936
Why do people accompany others?

10:02.978 --> 10:06.106
To sit there like an idiot
while you treat me like crap?

10:07.399 --> 10:08.942
- Done?
- Done with what?

10:08.984 --> 10:10.527
What else do you want me to say?

10:10.569 --> 10:12.529
I don't know.
What else do you want to say?

10:14.448 --> 10:15.699
Accept it, Mom.

10:17.326 --> 10:18.660
I'm not the son you wanted,

10:19.995 --> 10:22.289
and maybe you're not
the mom I would've wanted.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.668
And this isn't a game.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.671
You're dying and you act like
nothing is happening.

10:29.713 --> 10:32.090
You're wrong because I'm
getting better.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.051
You'll have to put up with me
for much longer.

10:34.092 --> 10:34.760
Mom, please.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.345
I'm serious.

10:36.386 --> 10:39.598
I have less pain now. I couldn't
move my fingers before.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.391
That's not because the
cancer's healing.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.769
It isn't? Then what's it mean?

10:46.021 --> 10:47.397
So you know more than me.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.318
Really, why do you want me
to go with you?

10:53.236 --> 10:54.738
You're fine without me.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.450
If you're looking for pity,

10:58.492 --> 10:59.910
you've got the wrong house.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.926
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

11:17.135 --> 11:19.304
Hi. I know you don't want
to talk to me.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.600
I understand why,
but I need you to listen to me.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.270
I can explain it all.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.315
And it's not what it seems.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.319
<i>Please don't publish anything
before listening to me.</i>

11:36.154 --> 11:37.739
<i>It's only logical at this point.</i>

11:40.867 --> 11:42.619
<i>Give me a chance to
clear it all up.</i>

12:37.799 --> 12:38.800
<i>Hello?</i>

12:40.594 --> 12:43.472
<i>Lola. Are you going
to talk or not?</i>

12:43.513 --> 12:44.931
Who is it?

12:44.973 --> 12:46.892
<i>Héctor Espinoza, the
DA's assistant.</i>

12:48.560 --> 12:49.936
<i>Of course. Go on.</i>

12:49.978 --> 12:51.730
I have to check something

12:51.771 --> 12:54.149
where the Israeli died,
the guy you're investigating.

12:55.734 --> 12:56.610
<i>Want to come?</i>

12:57.903 --> 12:59.196
Where and when?

12:59.237 --> 13:01.156
<i>I'm leaving the office
at 5 o'clock.</i>

13:01.198 --> 13:03.200
If you're not here, I'll
go without you.

13:06.077 --> 13:06.912
Shit!

13:18.757 --> 13:20.008
Fuck.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.681
Let's go.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.600
Where are we going exactly?

13:28.642 --> 13:29.726
Let's see...

13:29.768 --> 13:32.062
Just keep quiet because
it's very far.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.402
<i>Are you sure?</i>

13:41.238 --> 13:42.656
Unfortunately, yes.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.160
What'll I tell Félix?

13:49.037 --> 13:49.996
The truth,

13:51.623 --> 13:53.166
that your health
isn't improving.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.295
I don't understand. I was
feeling better.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.507
It might be because of the CBD.

14:00.549 --> 14:02.217
The CBD?

14:02.259 --> 14:03.677
We detected CBD in your blood.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.514
I suppose you're taking
some drops, right?

14:10.976 --> 14:13.853
I'm not against that.
It helps many patients.

14:18.275 --> 14:19.609
How much time do I have?

14:24.906 --> 14:27.158
That's very hard to predict.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.369
I'd say...

14:31.246 --> 14:32.872
two or three months.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.928
...that's him, and the panelist
coming tomorrow, the Canadian...

14:46.970 --> 14:49.139
Can I speak with you, please?

14:49.180 --> 14:50.098
I'm sorry.

14:50.849 --> 14:51.808
Excuse me.

14:51.850 --> 14:52.851
Yes.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.730
I just want to ask
you something.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.106
And I'll go, I'll
leave you alone.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.067
Why don't you just
leave me alone?

15:01.943 --> 15:03.111
Go on with your life.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.946
Who sent you to
sabotage the crops?

15:07.115 --> 15:08.617
Who sent you, Susana?

15:10.327 --> 15:11.703
It's best if you don't know.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.955
They must've given you
a lot of money, huh?

15:13.997 --> 15:16.333
To destroy something you
helped create.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.668
It's not all about money.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.670
In the end,
it all comes down to money.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.506
- Think you'll get answers by insulting me?
- Was it Madre Verde?

15:23.548 --> 15:25.050
No, it wasn't Madre Verde.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.135
Then who?

15:27.177 --> 15:28.303
It's best you don't know.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.681
Since when do you know
what's best for me?

15:42.525 --> 15:43.526
It was your father.

15:44.694 --> 15:45.695
Happy now?

15:47.739 --> 15:49.491
You have to be truly unlucky

15:49.532 --> 15:51.826
for your own father to
want you to fail.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.539
Know what, Mariana? Yes.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.041
You're right.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.168
It all comes down to money.

16:00.210 --> 16:03.296
The only reason I
put up with you

16:03.338 --> 16:06.508
is because your father gave me
a ton of money to make you fail.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.096
Now, will you leave me alone?

16:39.541 --> 16:40.667
Shit.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.728
Son of a bitch...

17:16.578 --> 17:17.871
Oh, Lucas.

17:17.912 --> 17:20.039
Hi. I was just leaving to
meet your dad.

17:20.081 --> 17:22.959
No, you can't give
him the papers.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.128
- What happened?
- Give them to me, please.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.546
No, you made up your mind.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.131
My dad sabotaged the crops.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.342
- Your dad?
- Susana confessed everything.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.595
And you believe her?

17:33.636 --> 17:36.014
My dad's perfectly capable
of doing that, Lucas.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.891
Please, you're talking
about your father.

17:37.932 --> 17:41.311
I won't give him my land.
Can you give me that?

17:41.770 --> 17:42.812
No.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.232
You don't understand
what you're doing.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.484
Of course I understand.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.071
Mariana, it's not just
your future at stake.

17:53.698 --> 17:56.284
I don't care about Rosalía's future.
It's not my problem.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.410
I don't mean Rosalía.

17:57.452 --> 17:58.536
Then what?

18:05.001 --> 18:06.795
If I don't take this
to your dad,

18:08.338 --> 18:10.799
he'll knock back the deal
he has with us.

18:13.468 --> 18:14.886
My dad told you that?

18:14.928 --> 18:16.721
You know how important
this is for me.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.014
For you?

18:18.056 --> 18:19.265
Yes.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.523
So that's why you didn't say
anything about Cartagena.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.235
What's Cartagena got to
do with this?

18:30.276 --> 18:32.195
You said you were
worried about me.

18:32.237 --> 18:35.740
But that was shit, you were
only thinking about your job.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.660
Why don't we stop talking about my job
as if it were an independent entity?

18:38.701 --> 18:41.871
- It is an independent entity.
- No, it isn't.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.331
If I do well, we both do well.

18:43.373 --> 18:46.292
Oh, and if I don't, it
only affects me?

18:46.334 --> 18:47.752
Stop thinking about yourself.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.922
How can you say that right now?

18:50.964 --> 18:53.174
You know how much I
fought for this job.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.051
A job that wasn't even for you.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.471
That's what you think of me?

18:58.513 --> 19:01.724
No, Lucas. That's what you think
about yourself.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.685
That you're nothing more than a job
you don't deserve

19:03.726 --> 19:07.313
and you think I'm in your life
just to embellish it.

19:09.190 --> 19:09.899
Know what?

19:10.775 --> 19:12.402
I won't let you provoke me.

19:14.195 --> 19:14.946
No.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.574
I'll let you calm down,

19:17.615 --> 19:19.868
and think clearly

19:19.909 --> 19:21.536
about what's at stake here.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.541
I'm taking birth control pills.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.712
I've been taking
pills for months.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.180
You already knew.

19:44.267 --> 19:48.479
You knew and you'd still rather talk
about a fucking contract.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.191
- Why do you say that?
- Did you know or not?

19:52.817 --> 19:53.651
Yes.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.570
Yes, I knew.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.406
And we'll have a
serious conversation.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.699
When?

19:59.741 --> 20:02.452
Now we have to focus
on what's truly important.

20:02.493 --> 20:05.204
What's truly important, Lucas?

20:06.331 --> 20:08.666
What's more important
than my land?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.920
What's more important
than your marriage?

20:13.379 --> 20:16.215
Than your dream of being a dad?
Of having a family?

20:18.635 --> 20:22.138
What's more important
than your famous teamwork?

20:29.646 --> 20:31.189
Your answer is...

20:32.273 --> 20:34.567
so clear and so obvious.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.031
You and I...

20:40.698 --> 20:42.158
We're not a team.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.354
Hello, Eva.

21:13.189 --> 21:16.484
Félix isn't here. Maybe you'd like
to come in and wait.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.529
He's not answering his phone.

21:19.570 --> 21:23.449
No, when he wants to be alone, not
even his conscience can find him.

21:26.744 --> 21:27.745
Did you drive over?

21:28.413 --> 21:29.747
Yes, why?

21:29.789 --> 21:31.791
- Could you do me a favor?
- Of course.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.334
I need to go somewhere.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.421
- Well, it's just that...
- It's nearby.

21:38.006 --> 21:38.840
Okay.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.595
- Félix told me about...
- The cancer.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.099
I don't know why he
talks about that...

21:49.934 --> 21:50.643
And how are you?

21:52.270 --> 21:56.315
Fine. You work with marijuana,
so you know bad weed never dies.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.737
Félix's motorcycle.

22:00.778 --> 22:03.114
Yes, it was his motorcycle
a few years ago.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.199
But he told me you sold it.

22:05.241 --> 22:11.080
Yes, his dad sold it, changed his mind,
looked for it, finally got it back...

22:11.122 --> 22:13.875
I wanted to give it to him
when he came back, but

22:14.625 --> 22:15.752
time went on...

22:16.919 --> 22:17.920
life went on...

22:18.963 --> 22:23.593
It's been here and a few months ago
I came to get it fixed.

22:25.887 --> 22:28.306
He'll die when he sees it.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.141
That bike was his life.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.602
You were his life.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.608
Can I ask you a favor?

22:38.649 --> 22:40.401
Of course.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.987
Can you give it to him
when it's ready?

22:44.238 --> 22:45.198
Me?

22:47.033 --> 22:49.035
Yes, in case I don't make it.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.372
Don't say that, Eva.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.792
Of course you'll be able
to give it to him.

22:57.126 --> 23:00.129
That's a nice fairy tale, but

23:00.171 --> 23:02.256
I need to know if you can
give it to him.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.807
I'll give him the bike
if you can't.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.603
Thank you.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.273
Well,

23:19.315 --> 23:24.362
you have to go to work, so we should
go and let the mechanics get to it.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.651
You know wine isn't
good for you.

24:05.194 --> 24:06.654
It's just one glass.

24:10.158 --> 24:11.075
How'd it go?

24:12.368 --> 24:13.202
Fine.

24:14.203 --> 24:15.830
And you, with Dr. Palacios?

24:20.209 --> 24:21.210
Fine.

24:22.253 --> 24:23.796
How's treatment going?

24:27.592 --> 24:28.718
I'm improving.

24:33.598 --> 24:36.559
Could you leave me some drops
in the kitchen?

24:36.601 --> 24:37.768
What drops?

24:39.395 --> 24:40.771
You know what drops.

24:42.607 --> 24:44.734
I'd like to take some
before going to bed.

25:10.885 --> 25:14.180
Okay, ready. Get going, we're
already late. Thanks, Henry.

25:16.474 --> 25:17.975
So here you are.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.102
I looked all over for you.

25:20.144 --> 25:22.271
We were boxing it up
to send it to the airport.

25:23.147 --> 25:25.316
Everything? The whole order?

25:25.358 --> 25:28.486
In no time, Ilana Frank will have
this in her warehouse in Canada.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.446
You're kidding.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.157
Thank you.

25:35.243 --> 25:38.663
Listen, I want to talk to you.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.874
This...

25:41.916 --> 25:44.794
This doesn't make sense.
I don't want us to be like this.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.297
I want to apologize.

25:49.507 --> 25:50.466
For what?

25:52.051 --> 25:53.052
For everything.

25:55.805 --> 25:58.307
For not being honest with you,
for not being clear.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.977
For not being able to tell
you what I did.

26:04.313 --> 26:06.524
For hiding things from you.

26:10.111 --> 26:11.153
Know what?

26:12.446 --> 26:13.990
I'm sick of all this.

26:17.285 --> 26:20.079
Honestly, everything's harder
than we thought.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.747
We're making it harder.

26:21.789 --> 26:24.083
But we achieved something great.

26:24.125 --> 26:24.792
Great?

26:26.294 --> 26:29.964
Great, what? It's just a van
going from one place to another.

26:30.006 --> 26:30.715
I dunno...

26:31.966 --> 26:35.052
I think you need to change
your perspective.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.973
I just want Ilana to send the money
so we can pay Teo back.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.518
That's my perspective.

26:43.644 --> 26:44.854
Isn't it sad?

26:45.438 --> 26:46.814
That I can't see

26:48.107 --> 26:50.943
beyond the noise,
as if nothing else existed?

26:53.154 --> 26:54.405
I'm here.

26:55.156 --> 26:56.782
You're not here, Mari.

26:58.159 --> 27:00.870
Félix, I'm here.

27:01.787 --> 27:02.621
Why?

27:04.415 --> 27:07.960
So I can forgive you for lying?
I forgive you.

27:10.796 --> 27:14.216
You can stab me in the chest and
I'll always forgive you, Mariana.

27:15.676 --> 27:18.471
You think I'm capable of
stabbing you in the chest?

27:19.138 --> 27:20.056
These days,

27:21.307 --> 27:22.767
I'm not so sure.

27:30.107 --> 27:32.443
Know why I didn't tell
you about Assaf?

27:32.485 --> 27:34.070
I don't wanna talk about that.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.281
Because I slept with him.

27:42.244 --> 27:43.996
Why'd I sleep with him?

27:46.165 --> 27:49.251
Not a day goes by
I don't ask myself that.

27:52.046 --> 27:53.381
Why didn't I tell you guys?

27:54.632 --> 27:57.385
Because I was terrified
of telling <i>you</i> .

28:02.640 --> 28:05.601
Because I treated you like shit
at the beach, and because...

28:06.685 --> 28:08.646
I ended up in a shit place,

28:08.687 --> 28:11.399
in a shit bed, with a shit guy.

28:15.903 --> 28:19.365
As far as I'm concerned, you can
sleep with whomever you want.

28:21.575 --> 28:24.245
So how come, when I see you,
I feel I shouldn't?

28:27.748 --> 28:29.542
See how you can stab me?

28:31.502 --> 28:33.462
I'm not trying to hurt you,
Fefe.

28:33.504 --> 28:34.630
Then why?

28:34.672 --> 28:35.714
I don't know.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.342
But it's the truth.

28:39.969 --> 28:42.388
A truth full of... noise.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.519
So you don't care
about me anymore?

28:49.728 --> 28:50.938
Oh, Mari.

28:52.481 --> 28:55.276
I care more about you
than myself.

28:58.529 --> 29:00.489
Ever since I met you,

29:00.531 --> 29:01.949
that's been my fucking life.

29:03.159 --> 29:05.828
I was even willing to go
to prison for you.

29:08.539 --> 29:10.166
But I'm sick of that.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.251
No more.

29:16.046 --> 29:17.631
I dunno where this
conversation's going,

29:18.549 --> 29:20.926
but you and I are just partners.

29:32.521 --> 29:33.647
<i>I was on my way out.</i>

29:34.607 --> 29:36.942
Don't worry. I'll be brief.

29:38.861 --> 29:40.112
Give me a whiskey.

29:49.246 --> 29:50.456
Serve it yourself.

29:51.957 --> 29:54.752
You can take the glass,
you don't have to drink it here.

29:58.380 --> 29:59.548
I'll drink it quickly.

30:00.174 --> 30:01.217
It's fine.

30:05.721 --> 30:06.847
Listen...

30:09.016 --> 30:12.019
I was thinking about
our other conversation,

30:13.729 --> 30:15.064
and honestly...

30:17.358 --> 30:19.401
I was upset to see
you so worried.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.278
You were upset?

30:23.447 --> 30:25.699
You never felt
empathy for anyone.

30:25.741 --> 30:26.784
I'm serious.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.662
And since I'm a good cousin,

30:30.913 --> 30:33.207
I came to help you get
your story straight.

30:33.832 --> 30:34.833
Oh, yeah?

30:36.752 --> 30:38.045
You don't say.

30:40.548 --> 30:42.007
I'll tell you the whole story.

30:43.592 --> 30:44.385
I got home,

30:45.135 --> 30:48.097
I sat down, got a drink,

30:49.515 --> 30:52.893
and I started to ask myself
what kinds of business

30:52.935 --> 30:54.270
you could do in Tayrona.

30:55.688 --> 30:58.232
I called a friend and I asked him,
"Hey, dude,

30:58.274 --> 31:00.442
what kinds of business
can you do in Tayrona?"

31:01.402 --> 31:03.904
And he very kindly answered,

31:03.946 --> 31:06.282
"Tourist hostels for hippies?"

31:08.075 --> 31:09.827
And I thought and said "No...

31:11.036 --> 31:13.163
No, Nachito doesn't give
a shit about that.

31:13.914 --> 31:14.915
What else is there?"

31:16.083 --> 31:17.585
And he said,

31:18.335 --> 31:19.336
"Cannabis".

31:21.130 --> 31:22.464
Cannabis?

31:24.508 --> 31:25.134
Maybe that's it.

31:26.844 --> 31:30.848
But what kinds of business can
you do in Tayrona with cannabis?

31:32.474 --> 31:33.684
Drug trafficking?

31:34.310 --> 31:35.227
I don't think so.

31:36.812 --> 31:37.896
Selling seeds?

31:39.064 --> 31:39.732
Maybe.

31:40.691 --> 31:43.193
So I told him, "Yeah, dude, but

31:43.235 --> 31:45.487
I don't see anything
special about that."

31:46.238 --> 31:47.239
And he responded,

31:48.657 --> 31:49.658
"Unless...

31:50.576 --> 31:52.578
we're talking about KannaLab."

31:55.331 --> 31:56.624
KannaLab?

32:00.169 --> 32:02.087
The company that became famous

32:02.129 --> 32:03.922
because it had the best seed.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.925
The Holy Grail of seeds.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.929
So I was curious and I started

32:10.971 --> 32:15.976
to read all the articles and
interviews you did with the press.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.563
And I found a very
special article.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.400
That, by the way,
was published by your friend...

32:23.442 --> 32:24.068
Miguel?

32:25.152 --> 32:27.446
The article said all
the genetics,

32:28.697 --> 32:31.283
absolutely all of the
company's genetics,

32:32.409 --> 32:34.036
had been developed in Bogotá.

32:35.204 --> 32:37.581
But it didn't mention
Tayrona anywhere.

32:38.749 --> 32:39.958
Strange, huh?

32:44.129 --> 32:47.299
So I kept thinking, pondering...

32:48.550 --> 32:49.760
And I asked myself,

32:51.637 --> 32:53.389
what if Nachito's business

32:54.848 --> 32:58.227
was to get one of those seeds
from the black market

32:59.269 --> 33:01.689
and sell it as if
he'd created it?

33:03.816 --> 33:07.695
What if this is all part of the
shitshow Nachito got himself into?

33:07.736 --> 33:09.613
And that's why he needed help?

33:12.783 --> 33:14.159
The mystery of Tayrona.

33:19.707 --> 33:20.582
Done?

33:22.960 --> 33:25.504
Done with your soap opera villain
monologue?

33:27.965 --> 33:29.883
Did you practice in
front of a mirror?

33:31.719 --> 33:33.137
Oh, Ignacio...

33:34.346 --> 33:36.974
If I were a soap opera villain,

33:37.015 --> 33:38.517
I'd be saying something else.

33:38.559 --> 33:40.060
Like what?

33:41.395 --> 33:42.688
That I'm friends with Bigfoot?

33:42.730 --> 33:44.732
That I'll microchip you
courtesy of Bill Gates?

33:44.773 --> 33:46.775
Or any other half-assed theory?

33:46.817 --> 33:47.818
No.

33:49.278 --> 33:52.573
For example, I'd say
I could hire

33:52.614 --> 33:55.659
the best private investigators
in the country

33:55.701 --> 33:58.078
to look into my theories.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.248
See what they find.
You never know.

34:01.290 --> 34:03.542
If you're threatening me,
it isn't working.

34:03.584 --> 34:04.877
Are you sure?

34:05.878 --> 34:08.464
Looking at you, I think it is.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.966
That you, standing there,
are shitting bricks.

34:11.008 --> 34:14.011
Because you know I'm on
the right track.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.138
Tell me, what's all this about?

34:19.141 --> 34:22.978
I also heard you met
with Madre Verde.

34:24.688 --> 34:27.399
And you're talking about...

34:27.441 --> 34:30.486
the legalization of
recreational cannabis.

34:30.527 --> 34:31.862
So now you're spying on us.

34:32.905 --> 34:33.989
Great.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.204
Know what the problem is,
Ignacio?

34:42.664 --> 34:45.042
You think you have
everything under control,

34:46.835 --> 34:48.253
but what's going on here

34:49.963 --> 34:51.006
is greater than me,

34:52.966 --> 34:54.676
and greater than all of you.

35:02.851 --> 35:05.938
We tried to make you understand
the easy way.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.107
It didn't work.

35:11.193 --> 35:13.237
Now we'll make you understand
the hard way.

35:16.031 --> 35:19.868
Make sure those people don't
keep pushing for legalization.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.329
Because we're not alone.

35:23.247 --> 35:25.165
And if you go down that path,

35:30.295 --> 35:31.922
you'll be destroyed.

35:35.676 --> 35:36.844
I'm taking the glass.

36:06.623 --> 36:10.294
THE DELIVERY JUST ARRIVED.
YOU MADE HISTORY. CELEBRATE!

36:54.129 --> 36:57.841
THE DELIVERY JUST ARRIVED.
YOU MADE HISTORY. CELEBRATE!

37:40.842 --> 37:42.636
Here's where they
found Assaf's car.

37:48.642 --> 37:50.519
This is the middle of
fucking nowhere.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.896
- What?
- It's the middle of fucking nowhere.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.357
That's why it took so long
to find the body.

37:56.525 --> 37:58.318
Nobody just stumbles
upon this place.

38:00.862 --> 38:02.614
And where's the house?

38:02.656 --> 38:04.241
We're halfway there.

38:06.118 --> 38:08.370
<i>This is my third message.</i>

38:08.412 --> 38:10.789
<i>I'm not asking you to answer.</i>

38:10.831 --> 38:13.083
I probably wouldn't either,
if I were you.

38:18.672 --> 38:22.175
But please let me talk
as if you were listening, yeah?

38:26.638 --> 38:28.932
I'm not gonna lie,
I don't know what to say.

38:32.269 --> 38:34.604
Ignacio Santamaría doesn't know
what to say.

38:40.402 --> 38:41.403
I...

38:48.410 --> 38:49.953
Look, maybe...

39:19.024 --> 39:19.941
Here.

39:23.904 --> 39:24.780
So...

39:26.406 --> 39:29.326
Are you gonna tell me why this case
is so important to you?

39:33.538 --> 39:36.416
It's one of those cases where I
just need to know the truth...

39:38.335 --> 39:39.628
to go on with my life.

39:41.338 --> 39:43.006
I had a case like
that years ago.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.719
My brother was accused
of stabbing his wife.

39:50.347 --> 39:51.890
I was on it for ten years.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.322
Did you find out if your
brother did it?

40:09.282 --> 40:10.117
No.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.286
I never found out.

40:14.663 --> 40:16.832
In the end, I stopped
chasing the truth

40:16.873 --> 40:19.000
simply to go on with my life.

40:33.181 --> 40:35.016
Why'd you need to come here?

40:36.184 --> 40:37.936
Why'd <i>you</i> need to come?

40:40.272 --> 40:42.858
I might find something
you didn't see.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.735
I've seen everything here.

40:48.697 --> 40:51.032
You just need fresh eyes.

40:52.826 --> 40:55.203
You learn a lot by visiting
where things happened.

40:56.872 --> 40:59.291
It's my third time here and I
haven't found anything else.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.388
How'd the Israeli die?

41:14.806 --> 41:16.349
There's nothing online.

41:20.562 --> 41:21.646
Don't fuck with me, Espinoza.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.943
You just told me your brother's
story and now you're holding back?

41:42.250 --> 41:43.418
How'd he die?

41:44.961 --> 41:46.922
He was shot in the head.

42:06.900 --> 42:09.069
<i>He's dead, I checked, Félix!</i>

42:09.110 --> 42:12.030
<i>-Then we have to call the cops.
- Doll face, look at me!</i>

42:12.072 --> 42:14.866
<i>If</i> <i>we</i> <i>get</i> <i>caught</i> <i>up</i> <i>in</i> <i>this</i> <i>shit,
they'll</i> <i>use</i> <i>my</i> <i>name...</i>

42:14.908 --> 42:17.661
<i>We didn't do anything, Nacho!</i>

42:17.702 --> 42:19.955
Ignacio's right. He's right,
Félix.

42:19.996 --> 42:22.374
And? What'll happen
when they find the body?

42:22.415 --> 42:24.417
<i>And who'll find it?
We're in such deep fucking shit!</i>

42:24.459 --> 42:26.086
Nobody knows we're here.

42:26.127 --> 42:29.089
Nobody knows. Look at me.

42:29.130 --> 42:33.009
<i>We don't have to take the
blame for this.</i>

42:33.051 --> 42:35.053
Okay? We have to go now.

42:35.095 --> 42:37.180
Félix, let's go, Fefe.

42:37.222 --> 42:40.684
Come on, Fefe! We have
to leave now!
