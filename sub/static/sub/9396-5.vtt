00:29.870 --> 00:31.054
It’s called ‘Dare Night’.

00:31.377 --> 00:34.521
One night, two teams, multiple dares.

00:36.656 --> 00:38.755
Each envelope contains a two-part dare.

00:39.292 --> 00:41.852
Part one is on the front; part two is on the back.

00:41.925 --> 00:43.865
Each dare is worth a certain number of points.

00:44.116 --> 00:46.384
This cell phone has picture and video.

00:46.481 --> 00:47.244
Oh sweet!

00:48.017 --> 00:51.060
You do the dare; you send proof of it to the other team.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.127
At midnight, time’s up.

00:53.337 --> 00:54.846
We meet back here and declare the winner.

00:54.924 --> 00:55.917
And what do we win?

00:56.077 --> 00:58.334
You Mouth, win an excuse to be out till midnight.

00:58.472 --> 01:00.505
The rest of you, get a night to remember.

01:01.693 --> 01:03.660
And you get to humiliate us.

01:04.432 --> 01:05.654
Why would we do that?

01:06.659 --> 01:10.527
Look guys, there’s nothing in these envelopes that’s harmful to you or anyone else.

01:10.653 --> 01:13.275
It’s all about having fun, testing your limits.

01:13.423 --> 01:15.380
Every once in a while, you gotta wake yourself up.

01:16.167 --> 01:17.288
You wanna do it Nate?

01:18.149 --> 01:22.685
All anybody does in this town is brood and… pout, get married.

01:24.487 --> 01:25.424
I’ll play.

01:26.929 --> 01:29.832
Yeah, what the hell. I’m up for something daring.

01:32.894 --> 01:33.851
Who else is in?

01:46.958 --> 01:50.191
Come on! I wanna play. I didn’t get invited.

01:51.511 --> 01:56.186
Tell you what; you can play if… Brooke and Lucas play.

02:06.303 --> 02:08.940
- Pick the stupid teams. 
- Alright.

02:09.267 --> 02:13.917
Boys against the girls. You six guys against the three girls… plus me.

02:13.994 --> 02:15.166
I count as three anyway.

02:15.337 --> 02:16.845
Yeah, three girls!

02:19.723 --> 02:21.284
Sweet. Teams are set.

02:25.129 --> 02:27.265
- What’s this? 
- That my friend…

02:27.823 --> 02:29.446
is your first dare.

03:22.284 --> 03:24.849
Return these clothes to stores in the mall.

03:24.936 --> 03:25.879
What’s so hard about that?

03:28.357 --> 03:29.509
While wearing them.

03:34.435 --> 03:36.845
- Hello? 
- You guys ready to forfeit yet?

03:37.441 --> 03:41.408
You talk a big game little booty, but we about to light your ass; up.

03:41.490 --> 03:42.304
Game on.

03:46.444 --> 03:48.457
Alright. Nate you got your picture phone?

03:48.539 --> 03:50.726
- Yeah. 
- Beautiful. Skills.

03:50.874 --> 03:51.837
I got one.

03:52.420 --> 03:56.609
Alright boys, that game is to divide and conquer. Alright, I’ll catch up with you guys later.

03:56.834 --> 03:59.502
If not, we meet at the café at midnight.

04:00.152 --> 04:01.489
You really gonna do this dare?

04:02.605 --> 04:03.399
Yeah.

04:03.956 --> 04:06.440
You know why? Coz he doesn’t think I will.

04:06.532 --> 04:07.284
Strong.

04:09.101 --> 04:11.067
- Tim, you’re coming with me. 
- I’m in it to win it.

04:11.162 --> 04:12.948
Just say yes, Tim.

04:17.315 --> 04:20.622
- Damn, he is good. 
- But I’m better.

04:22.703 --> 04:23.960
Catch you guys later.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.250
Let’s do this.

04:28.232 --> 04:30.386
Okay, hate to break up Charlie’s Angels but…

04:30.504 --> 04:33.105
you guys take the Cingular phone and do these.

04:33.734 --> 04:35.613
There’s nothing too crazy on there.

04:35.696 --> 04:37.273
Why do I have to go with you?

04:37.473 --> 04:40.551
Because this is your first dare.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.416
Please! I could do that in my sleep.

04:47.728 --> 04:50.298
Great! Prove it.

04:59.902 --> 05:01.235
A little to the left.

05:10.692 --> 05:12.115
You like ‘The Constantines’?

05:12.360 --> 05:13.150
Sure.

05:14.275 --> 05:17.516
I mean as much as anyone can like a band they’ve never heard of.

05:21.746 --> 05:24.494
So… how’s it going? Um… is everything okay?

05:24.588 --> 05:29.067
You’ve stopped in for coffee every morning this week and well I enjoy seeing you

05:29.155 --> 05:31.643
it’s just, well I’m not sure it’s appropriate.

05:31.715 --> 05:33.916
Well you know, in some cultures ah, you can buy coffee

05:33.977 --> 05:36.952
without actually having to have sex with the café owner.

05:37.085 --> 05:40.429
Um, you know, those cultures aren’t nearly as much fun for me but what you gonna do?

05:41.469 --> 05:44.370
I have... I’ve jumped to conclusions.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.165
I’m sorry.

05:48.908 --> 05:51.743
Um… forget that I came by.

05:52.431 --> 05:54.688
- Absolutely. Won’t mention it again. 
- Thank you.

05:54.811 --> 05:56.454
As long as you have dinner with me.

06:09.426 --> 06:11.507
I’d like to return this shirt.

06:14.505 --> 06:17.400
Oh, I happen to have the receipt. Here it is, yeah.

06:24.032 --> 06:26.075
Can I ask you why you’d like to return it?

06:26.233 --> 06:29.638
Um… wrong size?

06:31.733 --> 06:33.514
Can’t we get you another size?

06:33.595 --> 06:35.290
No, thanks, no I’m good.

06:36.294 --> 06:37.073
I’m good.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.630
Oh um… excuse me?

06:41.102 --> 06:43.226
Would you mind taking a picture?

06:43.963 --> 06:44.782
Thank you.

06:48.157 --> 06:49.294
Smile!

06:52.171 --> 06:55.647
Hi, can we have five pickled eggs please?

06:55.914 --> 06:58.427
So I had an idea, why don’t we just get a picture of you eating one egg

06:58.468 --> 07:00.041
and then tell them you ate five.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.724
Haley James-Scott, we don’t cheat.

07:02.825 --> 07:04.257
Well you did with Lucas.

07:04.325 --> 07:06.031
Don’t make me smack you!

07:07.058 --> 07:08.023
Here!

07:08.542 --> 07:09.456
Thank you.

07:09.686 --> 07:11.848
- Alright, are we doing this now? 
- Here we go!

07:11.919 --> 07:14.325
Do it, do it. Go go go.

07:18.260 --> 07:20.107
Four and a half more to go!

07:23.148 --> 07:24.929
Oh, make the five.

07:25.325 --> 07:28.554
Mmmm. Not cheating tastes good.

07:28.763 --> 07:30.801
Get that away from me you crazy...

07:44.316 --> 07:47.190
Well this is it. Massage and Spa.

07:50.222 --> 07:51.691
What’s the back say?

07:53.790 --> 07:55.230
Ask for the special.

07:58.306 --> 07:59.783
It’s the Happy Ending.

08:03.489 --> 08:06.888
Okay, so all I have to do is get a table?

08:07.062 --> 08:09.948
With no waiting. It’s the hottest restaurant in town.

08:10.027 --> 08:13.589
If you insist on wasting my time, at least come up with better dares.

08:14.967 --> 08:17.160
- Hi, I was wondering...
- Name?

08:18.459 --> 08:20.568
- Brooke Davis. 
- No.

08:21.566 --> 08:23.308
You didn’t even check your list.

08:24.658 --> 08:26.246
Perhaps there’s another name.

08:26.359 --> 08:27.777
- Angelina Jolie. 
- No.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.068
- The Queen of Sheeba. 
- No.

08:29.149 --> 08:30.536
- The Queen of Hearts. 
- No.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.179
- How about Queen Latifah? 
- I’m afraid not.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.419
Table for two. Right this way sir.

08:46.844 --> 08:47.957
How did you do that?

08:48.023 --> 08:49.968
I made a reservation for two last week.

08:53.808 --> 08:55.281
Come on team mate.

09:01.851 --> 09:03.423
Can I… help you?

09:04.187 --> 09:06.669
Forty-one thousand four hundred and sixty seven dollars.

09:06.833 --> 09:07.668
Okay…

09:07.744 --> 09:09.941
I know exactly what the dealer invoice on this car is.

09:10.028 --> 09:15.849
MSRP, tax, freight. I don’t wanna haggle over scotch or… floor mats or anything.

09:17.350 --> 09:18.460
Take it or leave it.

09:18.548 --> 09:20.678
- And you’re sure you want this car? 
- Absolutely.

09:20.795 --> 09:24.840
Hmm. Well maybe you wanna test-drive it before you over-pay me.

09:42.235 --> 09:45.499
Cameras, are you seeing this?

09:54.413 --> 09:57.323
It says we have to get a hit on the fastest pitching machine.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.000
Oh man, this all good, back up.

09:59.538 --> 10:00.864
Using your head.

10:02.478 --> 10:05.586
Well come on man, get in there. We aint got all day. Let’s go.

10:05.714 --> 10:10.004
So what, you can’t get a date. Move to new towns and trick people into eating with you?

10:10.454 --> 10:13.434
Wow, you totally exposed me.

10:13.624 --> 10:15.406
Seriously, I mean mostly naked here.

10:19.358 --> 10:21.560
How bout you? What’s your story?

10:22.155 --> 10:23.844
Bored and ignored.

10:25.078 --> 10:29.296
Bored maybe… but you never been ignored by a guy in your life.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.395
I meant at home, genius.

10:31.871 --> 10:38.169
Guys are easy. They usually fall for me over the first… pathetic… little… dinner.

10:38.512 --> 10:39.367
Yeah?

10:39.984 --> 10:45.138
What do they fall for first? The shoplifting or the eating disorder?

10:48.312 --> 10:49.407
Excuse me!

10:50.058 --> 10:54.292
Hi. Just curious; what’s your most expensive entrée?

10:55.162 --> 10:56.130
Well, we have...

10:56.224 --> 11:00.555
Sounds great. I’ll take two. I’m really hungry.

11:03.780 --> 11:06.986
Nicely played. I’ll be right back.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.672
Okay! Full body treatment.

11:16.790 --> 11:20.282
The special. We want the special.

11:20.875 --> 11:22.227
What exactly is the special?

11:22.324 --> 11:26.308
Oh the special is very nice.

11:26.836 --> 11:28.709
- Who’s first? 
- Me.

11:30.243 --> 11:35.255
Okay. I’ll just peel back your sheet.

11:35.324 --> 11:36.369
Oh yeah!

11:36.461 --> 11:39.140
So this is legitimate right? This is… like a massage?

11:39.213 --> 11:40.487
Dude, shut up!

11:41.075 --> 11:42.919
I am concentrating.

11:43.281 --> 11:46.462
Yeah, you know what, I really don’t think I need to be here for this.

11:46.610 --> 11:49.287
Oh… it won’t take long.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.583
Yeah, I’ll bet.

11:51.131 --> 11:57.096
Okay, one special! Full… body… wax!

11:58.520 --> 11:59.339
I’m out!

12:03.500 --> 12:05.101
Come on Mouth, toughen up dawg!

12:05.200 --> 12:07.161
- It’s gonna hurt! 
- So what? Be a warrior.

12:07.346 --> 12:10.090
- Yeah, take one for the team Mouth. 
- But what about you guys?

12:10.156 --> 12:12.184
- Man, I’m takin the pictures. 
- I’m helpin him.

12:17.171 --> 12:20.311
Dang! Man I missed that one. You gonna have to do it again.

12:20.469 --> 12:21.801
Come on, back on the plate.

12:23.473 --> 12:26.332
Uh… I need to return some pants.

12:26.541 --> 12:29.028
Okay... do you have them?

12:38.842 --> 12:39.777
Hello?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.660
You know, you shouldn’t be answering my phone.

12:41.737 --> 12:42.843
Where the hell are you?

12:43.032 --> 12:44.123
I’m at the café.

12:45.826 --> 12:46.755
What?

12:46.847 --> 12:49.218
Flip the dare card over, and read it.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.813
You did not just leave me here!

12:59.837 --> 13:03.098
Look, I don’t have the money to pay for this and I am not walking out on the cheque!

13:03.171 --> 13:05.608
Why not? I’ve seen you steal before.

13:06.039 --> 13:08.294
Besides, I dare ya.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.892
Okay. Just stay put son.

13:28.448 --> 13:30.552
Follow me! Hurry up!

13:47.097 --> 13:49.568
Excuse me Miss! Your bill!

13:52.108 --> 13:53.316
My car’s outside!

13:56.224 --> 13:57.315
Trust me.

14:12.475 --> 14:14.798
Ha, mission accomplished.

14:16.115 --> 14:17.309
You want the locker key back?

14:17.600 --> 14:20.088
No thanks! Look, I’m sorry about all of this.

14:20.273 --> 14:23.217
I… just… dare night thing.

14:23.754 --> 14:25.050
Just didn’t wanna back down.

14:25.142 --> 14:29.447
Oh yeah. I saw you earlier and I figured it was something like that.

14:30.427 --> 14:33.191
I didn’t want you to get busted for just having a little fun.

14:34.138 --> 14:35.003
Thank you.

14:36.283 --> 14:38.300
- So what’s your name? 
- Anna.

14:38.403 --> 14:40.815
I’m Lucas. You from Tree Hill?

14:40.917 --> 14:43.974
Yeah, but… we… wouldn’t have met.

14:44.081 --> 14:44.890
Why not?

14:45.111 --> 14:48.771
Oh, I tend not to roll with guys in bras and leather pants.

14:49.800 --> 14:50.730
You’re funny.

14:57.851 --> 15:02.364
Oh sorry. Anyway, I owe you one.

15:03.287 --> 15:07.628
Well… how bout you pay me back by letting me play too.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.464
Okay.

15:11.181 --> 15:13.106
So? What’s next?

15:13.352 --> 15:18.201
Um… I don’t know. Lets find out.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.015
Sell a box of cookies.

15:22.614 --> 15:27.345
Great. I get my crack waxed and you get… cookies.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.608
Felix left this for you.

15:35.932 --> 15:38.129
You know, I really don’t like this Felix kid.

15:42.230 --> 15:44.349
Good evening Mr and Mrs Tree Hill resident.

15:44.405 --> 15:47.401
We’re selling these delicious cookies to raise money for ‘Lady Leprechauns’.

15:49.843 --> 15:56.263
An organisation that empowers us girls to be strong, beautiful, independent women of tomorrow.

15:57.308 --> 16:01.112
Screw this dare night crap! Can’t believe I’m wearing a skirt!

16:01.414 --> 16:02.658
Yeah, in public.

16:05.073 --> 16:08.756
When we get back to the café, I’m gonna beat on that kid. Felix!

16:08.813 --> 16:09.975
I think he’s kinda cool.

16:10.149 --> 16:11.039
You would.

16:11.890 --> 16:15.105
I’m just saying. One week it’s Lucas, now it’s Felix.

16:15.561 --> 16:17.245
Just tell me who we’re hatin on next week

16:17.302 --> 16:19.140
Nate coz… I’m kinda having trouble keeping up.

16:19.196 --> 16:23.149
Yeah well you wouldn’t have that problem if you got a life of your own and quit living mine.

16:27.572 --> 16:28.525
Whatever!

16:31.219 --> 16:33.932
Tim, I didn’t mean that. Wait up man.

16:35.027 --> 16:35.929
Come on!

16:39.875 --> 16:42.021
So, um… where was I?

16:42.083 --> 16:44.259
You’re trying to force me to get the CD changer!

16:44.335 --> 16:47.462
I wasn’t forcing you. It’s just an option I thought you might like.

16:48.857 --> 16:54.626
There’s um… also the leather interior, the… optional touring package…

16:54.755 --> 16:59.434
and option to pause at stop signs!

17:04.938 --> 17:07.380
Okay, that wasn’t my fault. The thing just jumped out at me.

17:07.468 --> 17:09.608
- The stop sign? 
- It practically pounced!

17:10.263 --> 17:13.924
Okay! Um… I think maybe I should drive us back.

17:14.050 --> 17:15.233
No, I’ll be fine.

17:15.864 --> 17:17.585
I just get a little nervous.

17:17.851 --> 17:20.662
I only have so much money and this is a big decision for me.

17:20.883 --> 17:23.714
Besides, car sales men are always such jerks.

17:24.769 --> 17:26.519
Why are you smiling at me?

17:26.648 --> 17:31.492
My brother owns the dealership, I’m just helping out. I’m actually a mechanic.

17:32.238 --> 17:35.909
Oh. I like mechanics.

17:41.916 --> 17:44.282
Oh, you are such a jerk!

17:44.368 --> 17:45.802
Come on, it was just a dare.

17:45.976 --> 17:48.567
You got us big points for that one. Lock it up!

17:50.722 --> 17:52.258
You should be locked up!

17:52.443 --> 17:54.116
Brooke, I’m sorry! Don’t go.

17:55.438 --> 17:57.905
It was just part of the game. I promise.

18:00.327 --> 18:02.344
I didn’t know you’d be so upset. Okay?

18:04.305 --> 18:05.687
How bout you read the next one?

18:10.567 --> 18:12.856
Go to the cemetery. Hm!

18:13.430 --> 18:16.906
And take a photo in an open grave! That’s perfect.

18:16.998 --> 18:19.584
Since I plane on killing you, anyway!

18:20.609 --> 18:22.368
I think we get bonus points for that.

18:22.568 --> 18:23.361
Great!

18:26.136 --> 18:29.010
- Hey yo, Fergie, what’s the next dare? 
- Karaoke.

18:29.434 --> 18:33.229
- Mouth! 
- I like big butts and I can not lie,

18:33.323 --> 18:37.065
You other brothers can’t deny, 
When a girls walks in with an itty bitty waist

18:37.130 --> 18:39.895
And a round thing in your face 
You get sprung!

18:39.961 --> 18:42.695
Wanna pull up front 
Cuz you notice that butt was stuffed

18:44.108 --> 18:47.779
Okay, I got three dollars and… eighty cents!

18:48.554 --> 18:49.917
Alright, we need five dollars.

18:50.502 --> 18:51.748
Oh, a quarter!

18:51.955 --> 18:52.782
Fellas

18:53.043 --> 18:53.693
Fellas

18:53.882 --> 18:55.076
Has your girlfriend got the butt?

18:55.427 --> 18:56.448
Well shake it,

18:56.632 --> 18:57.406
Shake it,

18:57.585 --> 19:00.293
Shake that healthy butt 
Baby got back

19:10.118 --> 19:12.284
Okay, hold on a second.

19:13.953 --> 19:18.244
Oh, oh my gosh! Are you okay? It look... Oh! Ooh.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.022
So ladies 
Ladies

19:27.119 --> 19:28.945
If you wanna role in my Mercedes

19:29.017 --> 19:30.707
Then turn around 
Stick it out

19:30.788 --> 19:33.454
Even white boys got to shout 
Baby got back!

19:38.431 --> 19:40.291
Baby got back.

19:49.245 --> 19:50.598
So this is dinner.

19:50.675 --> 19:52.733
I want you to have anything you want. I’m rich you know.

19:52.820 --> 19:54.510
Well I’m getting chilli on mine!

19:54.878 --> 19:55.524
Thank you.

19:55.877 --> 19:56.599
Thank you.

19:57.479 --> 20:01.939
So… I know that my class is obviously the highlight of your week but what else do you like to do?

20:02.205 --> 20:06.521
Mostly school and the café and my son.

20:07.132 --> 20:08.759
You have a son? Nice.

20:08.831 --> 20:09.500
Yeah.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.345
Well he’s got a tough mom.

20:12.189 --> 20:14.883
I think it’s so great that you went back to school in your late twenties you know.

20:15.793 --> 20:16.684
Early thirties?

20:18.117 --> 20:19.240
My god, how old are you?

20:19.337 --> 20:22.460
Old enough to have never heard of that band, ‘The Constantines’.

20:22.541 --> 20:24.251
Ah, but you see, now you’re one of the hip kids.

20:24.446 --> 20:25.152
Hardly.

20:25.716 --> 20:30.887
So I was thinking about what you said last week; about challenging yourself, moving forward.

20:31.409 --> 20:34.585
Well I had a plan that I would open another business here in Tree Hill

20:34.820 --> 20:39.070
and I discussed it with my business partner and… we decided to take the plunge.

20:39.213 --> 20:39.936
Can I invest?

20:40.346 --> 20:41.133
No!

20:43.038 --> 20:44.983
But what would you say to some ice-cream?

20:45.767 --> 20:47.682
Oh it’s fine but I’m not really made of money, Karen.

20:48.337 --> 20:49.505
My treat.

20:50.698 --> 20:54.356
Well I love ice-cream but… if you bought me ice-cream, you know, does this mean that…

20:54.438 --> 20:57.333
You know, there are some cultures where you can actually have ice-cream-

20:57.415 --> 20:58.563
- Yeah, I get it.
- Yeah.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.936
How much do I owe you for the pizza?

21:06.509 --> 21:07.281
Nothing.

21:08.219 --> 21:10.113
I took a little extra from the fountain.

21:14.214 --> 21:16.282
This is… weird. Isn’t it?

21:17.081 --> 21:20.578
Oh I mean, people don’t just meet and hang out like this.

21:20.716 --> 21:21.884
Unless it’s a hook-up.

21:22.423 --> 21:25.114
- And it’s not?
- I didn’t think it was.

21:25.759 --> 21:28.253
Besides, not doing that anymore.

21:28.750 --> 21:29.702
Anymore?

21:32.421 --> 21:35.329
Long story. Trust me.

21:38.257 --> 21:40.782
Do you think two people can get to know each other…

21:40.854 --> 21:43.430
without ever going into their long stories?

21:44.606 --> 21:45.416
Sure.

21:46.219 --> 21:49.264
But isn’t who you were a part of who you are?

21:50.521 --> 21:51.581
Maybe,

21:52.472 --> 21:56.526
but I guess I’m saying that; I don’t really need to know the person that you used to be.

21:56.998 --> 22:00.725
As much… as the person that you’re trying to be.

22:02.649 --> 22:03.429
Yeah…

22:04.190 --> 22:04.995
me too.

22:08.559 --> 22:10.504
- You ready for our next dare?
- Oh, yeah.

22:13.438 --> 22:14.431
Do the honours.

22:19.454 --> 22:23.648
Take a photo, with a stranger… in a photo booth.

22:28.588 --> 22:29.428
Come on.

22:37.504 --> 22:40.524
So. I have a confession to make.

22:41.275 --> 22:45.500
The card doesn’t say take a photo with a stranger in a photo booth.

22:47.328 --> 22:48.096
No?

22:50.022 --> 22:54.507
No. It says… make out with a stranger in a photo booth.

22:56.539 --> 22:57.941
Ah, here’s the thing...

22:58.668 --> 23:03.185
Look, it’s just a dare, right? I mean… it’s no big deal.

23:08.575 --> 23:09.815
There’s a part two right?

23:10.343 --> 23:13.021
Ah; bonus points.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.599
You’re gonna have to get out for this one.

23:22.697 --> 23:24.576
Mm, enjoy.

23:32.464 --> 23:34.253
Okay! What’s next?

23:34.330 --> 23:35.522
You gonna tell what it was?

23:38.564 --> 23:39.517
Maybe!

23:44.401 --> 23:48.670
Okay, so I’m kinda thinking that… maybe we don’t really need these points so much.

23:49.105 --> 23:53.100
- Come on! I’ll protect you. 
- Yeah, that’s exactly what I’m counting on.

23:53.176 --> 23:54.615
Well maybe you prefer Lucas.

23:55.690 --> 23:57.257
What did Mouth tell you?!

23:57.400 --> 24:01.000
Nothing. We move around a lot, school cliques are easy to read;

24:01.106 --> 24:02.827
who rolls with who, that kinda thing.

24:03.305 --> 24:05.158
You and Lucas obviously had something.

24:05.756 --> 24:07.175
Yeah we had something.

24:08.931 --> 24:12.710
We had something fake and painful that I’m not gonna discuss

24:12.772 --> 24:14.763
with you and a bunch of dead people.

24:16.036 --> 24:20.205
What about you anyway? I can’t imagine anyone would actually date you.

24:20.272 --> 24:24.163
The question is; why would I date them? When I could just hook up with them instead.

24:24.665 --> 24:26.384
You know, friends with benefits.

24:26.691 --> 24:28.011
No strings attached.

24:28.074 --> 24:31.723
I don’t think that works. Somebody always ends up getting hurt.

24:31.863 --> 24:33.553
Not if you’re upfront about it.

24:33.855 --> 24:37.080
Think about it; you had sex this year, and so did I...

24:38.248 --> 24:41.572
but I didn’t end up in a cemetery talking about how painful it was.

24:43.062 --> 24:44.050
Oh perfect!

24:45.990 --> 24:47.117
This one will do.

24:48.858 --> 24:49.907
In you go.

24:50.413 --> 24:53.828
Oh no! You haven’t done anything tonight. Why do I have to go?

24:53.906 --> 24:55.289
I gotta work the camera phone.

24:55.985 --> 24:57.828
Besides, you wouldn’t be able to pull me out.

25:02.078 --> 25:03.899
I really don’t like you.

25:06.571 --> 25:07.458
Okay.

25:09.394 --> 25:10.197
Be careful.

25:19.533 --> 25:22.409
Okay. See you later.

25:22.482 --> 25:24.165
Felix, don't you dare leave me here!

25:27.135 --> 25:28.564
I’m just playing.

25:29.388 --> 25:31.201
Hold on. Let me get a picture.

25:38.662 --> 25:39.443
What’re you doing!?

26:03.602 --> 26:04.788
Stop it!

26:13.038 --> 26:15.617
Yo man, this dare is totally screwed up, dawg.

26:15.816 --> 26:17.916
Borrow a wild animal for the zoo?

26:18.126 --> 26:20.727
It’s like that movie where they try to steal the cougar but…

26:20.804 --> 26:23.262
- But what?
- Cougar ate their ass didn’t it?

26:24.131 --> 26:24.951
Sort of.

26:27.032 --> 26:30.070
Mouth man, I said a bird man. We in a damn snake house!

26:30.158 --> 26:31.975
Man, I’m not stealin no snake, dawg.

26:32.073 --> 26:35.586
Nothing with teeth, fangs or claws. Man forget it!

26:47.891 --> 26:49.700
I guess we could try for a fish.

26:49.839 --> 26:52.047
Uh-uh. Too slimy.

26:54.125 --> 26:57.725
Look, I got a problem with animals okay? I’ve never had a pet.

26:57.826 --> 27:01.436
I bet you Felix knows that too. I mean that dude is psychotic.

27:01.544 --> 27:03.485
- Psychic.
- Yeah, dat too.

27:14.500 --> 27:17.263
Okay, I think they’re gone. Gimme a boost.

27:17.749 --> 27:19.581
Are you kidding? Your shoes are muddy.

27:19.935 --> 27:22.801
It’s either you give me a boost or be buried alive girly girl.

27:24.183 --> 27:24.947
Fine!

27:33.712 --> 27:36.023
Okay. Get me out.

27:42.914 --> 27:47.162
Stupid dare night. Where did you come up with this ridiculousness anyway?

27:47.532 --> 27:48.889
I mean, what is the point!?

27:49.196 --> 27:50.111
The point is simple;

27:51.029 --> 27:54.219
see how far you’ll go. You face your fears.

27:54.429 --> 27:58.284
And sometimes you’ll do things you wanna do because calling it a dare makes it okay for a night.

27:58.350 --> 27:59.563
Things like what?

28:01.302 --> 28:02.703
Like spending time with me.

28:12.370 --> 28:17.039
So we never really talked about the wedding. Like… how you got there.

28:17.126 --> 28:20.603
I told you; I got dressed, I… threw up at my parent’s house,

28:20.669 --> 28:23.132
brushed, flossed and… went to the beach.

28:23.228 --> 28:26.982
Okay, hard image to forget. But, I meant more like...

28:27.125 --> 28:31.523
I don’t know; how your heart got there. Marriage is big.

28:31.616 --> 28:33.336
I don’t know how you trust somebody for your whole life.

28:33.387 --> 28:36.352
I can’t even… date somebody with that escape hatch.

28:37.816 --> 28:41.451
I don’t know if it was so much about trusting Nathan - which I do - it was…

28:41.830 --> 28:43.408
more about trusting myself.

28:44.042 --> 28:46.811
Yeah, my old friend; self doubt.

28:47.395 --> 28:50.791
I dunno, sometimes everything seem… really simple

28:51.038 --> 28:52.359
- and then... 
- It’s not?

28:53.243 --> 28:54.079
Yeah.

28:57.304 --> 28:59.411
Alright, so what does this card say again?

28:59.484 --> 29:02.127
We’re supposed to… go to the confessional and read whatever’s on the card

29:02.214 --> 29:04.779
except you’re not supposed to read it until we get in there.

29:04.870 --> 29:07.602
Right, right, right. So… okay, so here’s the deal;

29:08.046 --> 29:10.391
I’m actually trying to avoid eternal damnation…

29:10.929 --> 29:13.212
so… I’m gonna pass.

29:13.811 --> 29:16.079
Alright. Give it.

29:33.562 --> 29:36.037
Bless me father for I have sinned.

29:37.507 --> 29:40.988
You see, lately I’ve been having impure thoughts about…

29:45.592 --> 29:49.665
Um… actually, I haven’t been doing very well lately.

29:50.599 --> 29:54.336
This is… the first time I’ve been in a church since my mom died.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.587
I think about her every day!

30:04.300 --> 30:10.143
I just… I wonder what she would say to me right now if she could see me

30:10.808 --> 30:12.938
and see how I’ve been living.

30:14.453 --> 30:16.454
And I wonder if she knows

30:17.797 --> 30:23.060
and most days, I fall short of being the person that she wanted me to be.

30:25.297 --> 30:26.214
Or…

30:29.507 --> 30:33.530
I wonder if she saw me do that line of coke last week!

30:36.853 --> 30:41.170
And the thing is… I don’t even know why I did it.

30:42.594 --> 30:46.342
You know, my life is pretty good, it is.

30:49.479 --> 30:53.155
But… I was just searching for something to make it great.

30:54.939 --> 30:59.462
Something to make it matter so…

31:01.056 --> 31:04.901
I don’t know, I guess last week when I had the chance to change that

31:05.884 --> 31:09.131
and it was… it was right there in front of me,

31:10.713 --> 31:13.205
I guess I was just scared to let that go.

31:15.646 --> 31:17.573
But I know it was wrong.

31:19.186 --> 31:21.688
And I want my mom to know that and…

31:24.051 --> 31:26.574
I want her to know that I am not that person.

31:28.166 --> 31:29.671
And I’m not going to be.

31:32.014 --> 31:33.578
I’m sure she knows.

31:40.039 --> 31:41.049
Tim, wait up!

31:41.204 --> 31:43.654
I said I was sorry. I didn’t mean to tear you down!

31:43.732 --> 31:44.693
Then why did you?

31:45.135 --> 31:47.726
Because I was pissed at Felix alright? And you were defending him.

31:47.770 --> 31:50.516
- I just don’t like him flirting with Haley.
- It’s always about Haley.

31:50.588 --> 31:54.442
No it’s not always about her. Tim, what do you want me to say? She’s my wife now.

31:56.056 --> 32:00.228
You know, we used to be tight! It was always you and me.

32:00.541 --> 32:03.203
Now you’re constantly with Haley or Lucas,

32:03.271 --> 32:05.435
and there’s never any time for us to hang out.

32:06.649 --> 32:08.625
Don’t you miss your ‘Tim Time’?

32:09.993 --> 32:12.635
Do I miss hanging out with you? Yes.

32:13.096 --> 32:16.255
Do I miss you saying things like ‘Tim Time’? No.

32:16.982 --> 32:22.559
Look, Tim, I know a lot of things have changed but us being friends isn’t one of them.

32:23.648 --> 32:27.351
We’ve been boys a long time now. I wouldn’t trade that for anything.

32:29.014 --> 32:31.568
Especially now that everything’s so crazy. Alright?

32:33.800 --> 32:36.663
- Can we at least finish ‘Dare Night’?
- Yeah absolutely.

32:36.816 --> 32:39.360
Good. Coz this next one’s great.

32:44.901 --> 32:48.517
Well I’d, uh, point out the safety features but I think that fact that...

32:48.715 --> 32:50.877
you know, we got back in one piece speaks for itself.

32:53.006 --> 32:55.377
Look Jules; you picked a good car.

32:55.505 --> 33:00.522
But… the price you offered me was a grand too high and I couldn’t take a penny more.

33:00.666 --> 33:03.889
- Is this some new car selling trick?
- How would I know? I’m just a mechanic.

33:05.105 --> 33:06.876
How bout if I think about it?

33:07.222 --> 33:09.595
Was my counter offer too low?

33:09.707 --> 33:13.937
No, I just figured that if I wait a few days, then you’ll have to call me.

33:14.908 --> 33:15.996
You have my number.

33:23.386 --> 33:24.828
Eternal damnation for you?

33:26.067 --> 33:28.616
I think jury’s still out on that one.

33:29.114 --> 33:30.133
Are you okay?

33:31.263 --> 33:31.938
Yeah.

33:34.009 --> 33:36.071
Thanks for hanging out with me tonight Haley.

33:36.924 --> 33:38.462
You’re a good friend.

33:41.832 --> 33:42.624
Thanks.

33:45.508 --> 33:46.566
This was fun.

33:47.194 --> 33:49.962
I’m glad we did this. I needed a night like ‘Dare Night’.

33:50.499 --> 33:51.917
Yeah, me too.

33:59.956 --> 34:02.244
Steal the Tiki God from the second hole right?

34:02.494 --> 34:03.821
Here, check out part two.

34:07.149 --> 34:09.991
Get it? Dude, the hole’s number two!

34:12.116 --> 34:14.415
There is something wrong with you. You know that right?

34:15.280 --> 34:17.205
What? I didn’t write the dare card.

34:18.297 --> 34:20.585
Dude, hand me the camera and give me some leaves alright?

34:23.706 --> 34:24.788
Thanks for hanging out tonight.

34:25.429 --> 34:26.263
Well thank you.

34:29.494 --> 34:31.346
Well… I better get going.

34:31.634 --> 34:34.981
I’ve got a business class in the morning and my teacher is a tyrant.

34:35.090 --> 34:36.339
Yeah, I heard about that guy.

34:38.572 --> 34:39.273
Karen,

34:41.996 --> 34:44.382
I think you’re doing a great thing; going after you new club.

34:45.770 --> 34:50.695
It’s a ‘Loosen up your collar’, ‘Run like a river’, ‘Glow like a beacon fire’.

34:51.730 --> 34:54.284
- Constantines?
- Oh, see how cool you are?

34:57.243 --> 34:59.558
Um Andy, what I said earlier…

35:01.067 --> 35:03.558
I did misread the café visit, right?

35:07.448 --> 35:08.743
Absolutely not.

35:10.648 --> 35:12.344
I’ll see you in class, Miss Roe.

35:16.938 --> 35:21.201
So, it’s almost midnight. The dares are done, we should head back.

35:22.661 --> 35:24.267
Actually, I can’t.

35:25.651 --> 35:27.242
I need to take off.

35:27.975 --> 35:31.431
You know, I had this… weird history of meeting girls

35:31.491 --> 35:33.407
and them… disappearing at the end of the night.

35:34.806 --> 35:36.284
You sure you can’t meet my friends?

35:37.303 --> 35:38.262
Not tonight.

35:40.247 --> 35:43.049
But how about… you give me your number?

35:49.804 --> 35:51.138
Can I have yours too?

35:51.430 --> 35:55.966
Luke, it was just ‘Dare Night’, right?

36:05.515 --> 36:07.107
No bonus points for you.

36:08.901 --> 36:09.728
Anna?

36:11.494 --> 36:12.974
I dare you to call me.

36:36.422 --> 36:38.408
The guys trail by a hundred and fifty points.

36:38.495 --> 36:39.303
Yes!

36:39.772 --> 36:40.613
We’re here.

36:40.991 --> 36:42.061
What is that?

36:42.235 --> 36:44.780
We had to capture a wild animal from the zoo.

36:44.902 --> 36:48.119
Yeah, you might wanna back up. This thing is kinda ferocious.

36:54.283 --> 36:57.806
Go ahead and laugh, but you shoulda seen this thing before we tamed it.

36:57.921 --> 37:01.292
I’m telling you, it was vicious. I mean it was snapping and…

37:02.501 --> 37:03.750
Oh man!

37:04.912 --> 37:08.444
Well, well. With your other dares, it appears to be a tie.

37:08.542 --> 37:11.240
Oh no, no. Wait, don’t forget this.

37:12.377 --> 37:14.650
Dude! What the hell are you doing?!

37:14.865 --> 37:16.919
It says it right here on the dare card.

37:18.112 --> 37:23.385
Man, that’s a typo. It’s supposed to say take a shot on the second hole.

37:25.311 --> 37:26.242
Tim!

37:27.230 --> 37:28.122
Gross!

37:28.342 --> 37:32.678
No dice. It’s still a tie and I just happen to have a tie breaker.

37:38.874 --> 37:41.500
Kiss a team mate on the mouth.

37:43.170 --> 37:44.823
Well I guess you guys win.

37:45.366 --> 37:46.252
Damn it!

37:46.353 --> 37:47.322
Convenient!

37:49.894 --> 37:50.726
Okay.

37:53.935 --> 37:54.597
Sorry!

37:57.091 --> 37:58.933
Okay! Alright.

38:01.436 --> 38:04.017
Unless any of you guys… kissed a stranger in a photo booth…

38:04.110 --> 38:05.655
that’s the only dare you didn’t do.

38:10.044 --> 38:11.084
Anybody?

38:16.130 --> 38:18.183
Sorry guys. Guess they win.

38:33.688 --> 38:37.324
You know Skills, you could always keep him. He could be your first pet.

38:37.421 --> 38:40.293
Man, I’m not bout to keep some creepy looking turtle, dawg.

38:40.960 --> 38:44.931
Besides, caged up aint living. He need to be free.

38:51.209 --> 38:52.218
There you go.

38:53.923 --> 38:56.488
You realise that was a saltwater turtle, right?

39:01.707 --> 39:04.827
- Hey, did you have fun tonight?
- Eventually, missed you though.

39:11.777 --> 39:13.394
I guess I’ll see you later then.

39:14.483 --> 39:17.753
Tim. How about a game of NBA Live?

39:18.592 --> 39:19.380
Alright.

39:26.735 --> 39:29.508
You see, the ‘Tim’ is on the house and you better recognise...

39:29.569 --> 39:31.371
Just say you’re gonna beat me, Tim.

40:02.234 --> 40:04.842
Admit it; you had a good time tonight.

40:05.332 --> 40:09.838
By a good time, you mean wasting an entire evening of my life that I can never get back?

40:09.910 --> 40:10.909
Then sure.

40:13.719 --> 40:15.132
I have a question for you.

40:16.249 --> 40:19.514
You said you read people and that’s how you knew to invite all of us tonight.

40:21.808 --> 40:23.335
So how’d you read me?

40:25.516 --> 40:27.061
I don’t know about you yet.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.319
Gonna have to watch you a little more.

40:34.612 --> 40:38.679
So I guess this night makes us friends! Right?

40:40.160 --> 40:41.014
Maybe.

40:41.142 --> 40:42.191
Friends with benefits?

40:43.825 --> 40:45.028
I’ll think about it.

40:58.387 --> 40:59.553
How was the mall?

41:01.587 --> 41:02.528
You don’t know?

41:03.077 --> 41:04.091
How would I?

41:05.540 --> 41:08.770
Fine. So, what’d you do tonight?

41:08.894 --> 41:11.309
Not much. Just explored really.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.243
Trying to figure this place out.

41:14.653 --> 41:16.819
I think we’re gonna like it here, Felix.

41:16.911 --> 41:17.658
Yeah.

41:19.159 --> 41:20.025
Me too.

41:21.406 --> 41:24.187
Okay. Goodnight, little sister.

41:34.021 --> 41:36.433
Hey. How was your night?

41:37.284 --> 41:38.363
Was good!

41:39.001 --> 41:39.859
Yours?

41:40.481 --> 41:41.902
It was good.

41:42.594 --> 41:46.127
Hey, do you have a CD by The Constantines?

41:46.238 --> 41:47.591
Yeah. Uhh…

41:49.633 --> 41:50.617
Here we go.

41:51.841 --> 41:53.208
It’s very hip, mom.

41:53.463 --> 41:56.857
Thanks. I thought I’d try something daring.
