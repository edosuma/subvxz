Transcription Enigmatica

01:06.716 --> 01:11.333
The Tale of the Mummy

01:15.348 --> 01:18.968
Valley of the Kings, Egypt
August 15, 1948

01:21.199 --> 01:25.767
The Turkel Expedition 
Day 262

01:40.050 --> 01:48.050
Allah Akbar

01:58.636 --> 02:00.536
Sir richard..Sir Richard..
Allah Akbar

02:02.066 --> 02:03.230
Sir Richard?

02:05.106 --> 02:06.202
Come in, Nabil

02:07.282 --> 02:11.480
- We discovered an entrance, it faces to the north.
- Are you certain of this?

02:13.770 --> 02:17.180
But this is wonderful news my boy.
This is wonderful news..

02:17.950 --> 02:20.470
- Do we have a name?
- No name..

02:22.578 --> 02:23.850
I see.

02:28.771 --> 02:31.343
Very well, we'll inform the others.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.063
Here's to the lost treasures of men.

02:36.278 --> 02:38.333
It's not about the treasure.
It's about history.

02:38.429 --> 02:41.813
The investors don't give a whit about
history. Unless they can sell it

02:41.966 --> 02:45.048
"Then they might be disappointed.
According to Nabil

02:45.073 --> 02:48.270
the inscriptions make no
mention of an occupants name.

02:49.148 --> 02:53.450
What's in a name? It what he possessed
in life that counts on the open market.

02:53.804 --> 02:56.986
On the contrary Mr.
Young, to the ancients a

02:57.011 --> 03:00.123
man's true essence is
contained in his name.

03:00.253 --> 03:03.126
Removing that from the
entrance to the tomb..

03:03.323 --> 03:06.874
Was considered a banishment
from the hereafter.

03:07.074 --> 03:09.466
Surely the best people we know
are going to hell anyway.

03:10.270 --> 03:12.248
There is no hell, only none-existence.

03:21.071 --> 03:25.557
"Richard Turkel August fifteenth 1948"

03:26.038 --> 03:28.269
Day 262

03:33.493 --> 03:39.421
Nine months of digging and finally
an entrance has been discovered.

03:41.222 --> 03:44.009
My hunch proved correct

03:44.048 --> 03:49.048
Let along this secluded
stretch lie a series of tombs.

03:49.349 --> 03:51.192
But who would be buried here?

03:52.194 --> 03:53.430
A Pharaoh, I presume

03:53.571 --> 03:56.685
Hidden safely from ancient thieves

03:57.419 --> 04:00.978
Today we uncover the truth.

04:13.723 --> 04:19.637
- I... I can't move! I'm stuck!
- Don't panic Parsons. Breath through your nose!!

04:19.866 --> 04:24.680
Blow it out of your arse
- what? Same to ya!

04:39.368 --> 04:42.108
The burial chamber must lie beyond.

04:44.204 --> 04:45.210
Astonishing..

04:45.980 --> 04:49.657
A virgin seal, unbroken.

04:50.138 --> 04:52.470
- You mean no looters?
- It would appear not

04:52.660 --> 04:56.875
- Lucky for us.
- Not luck, more a matter of fear.

04:56.967 --> 04:58.393
It's the curse, isn't it?

04:58.634 --> 05:00.264
Of course, it is a curse.

05:02.270 --> 05:04.403
Well, what's it say?

05:04.831 --> 05:12.831
Listen all who now have being avoid this
place, abandoned by all that is... holy

05:16.346 --> 05:24.346
I who have slaughtered the innocent I who
have... confused terror with ...pleasure

05:34.153 --> 05:37.799
Obviously lacking in self
esteem. Oh well, as long..

05:38.424 --> 05:41.777
As he was rich, we won't
hold it against him.

05:47.399 --> 05:48.399
We have a name

05:50.275 --> 05:51.275
Talos!

05:58.317 --> 06:01.317
Shall we begin?
History Beckons

06:01.670 --> 06:06.170
No, no that's sacrilege! We are
archaeologists, we're not grave robbers.

06:07.197 --> 06:14.197
Now be careful! What ever
you say "sire Richard".

06:17.450 --> 06:21.916
Expect we'd be remembered more fondly
then the bloke on the other side

06:26.744 --> 06:28.153
Wait!

06:28.583 --> 06:32.717
- What the devil you suppose that was?
- I suppose it was the wind.

06:50.233 --> 06:51.233
Impossible!

06:55.288 --> 06:57.488
Get out of here!!
Save yourself!

07:10.073 --> 07:12.340
What..is..happening...

07:14.546 --> 07:15.546
O God!

07:16.165 --> 07:17.165
Help Nabil!

07:19.848 --> 07:23.182
Hey, pull me out. Hurry up you bastards!

07:27.657 --> 07:28.657
Pull me up!

07:56.631 --> 07:57.631
God forgive us..

08:08.610 --> 08:10.237
January 1999

08:13.330 --> 08:15.109
Day 262

08:15.932 --> 08:20.775
Nine months of digging and finally an
entrance has been discovered.

08:21.589 --> 08:22.937
But who would be buried here?

08:23.548 --> 08:25.265
A Pharaoh, I presume.

08:25.669 --> 08:28.049
Hidden safely from ancient thieves.

08:28.732 --> 08:31.044
Today we uncover the truth

08:46.867 --> 08:51.173
Digits. I see digits,
a series of numbers

08:51.292 --> 08:54.434
four, four being
"January", four being,

08:54.459 --> 08:57.672
April... April the a ..
April the twentieth

08:57.857 --> 09:01.084
That's my granddad's birthday.
How do you do that?

09:01.569 --> 09:07.269
Don't know. Kinda spooky really,
I just see, oh everything.

09:07.447 --> 09:10.337
He obviously deduces it from
the inane series of questions

09:10.362 --> 09:13.145
he's been asking, it is a
trick, it's a very old one.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.043
Yeah, well I will give
you a hand with that...

09:18.701 --> 09:20.264
Come here Miss, I'll give you a buckle.

09:22.076 --> 09:26.124
OkÃ© folks. The old coot finally
worked out all the glitches.

09:27.268 --> 09:28.314
We go in one hour.

09:37.225 --> 09:38.934
This is Operations
Control can you hear me?

09:39.782 --> 09:41.920
- Professor Marcus, Is that you,
I don't believe it.

09:42.050 --> 09:43.869
- Good afternoon mister Cortese

09:44.126 --> 09:47.351
Claire you little minx.
Giving out my number again?

09:47.460 --> 09:50.239
Knock it off Cortese.
This is not a god-damn field trip.

09:50.410 --> 09:52.980
"Thank you doctor Mulrooney.
Load and clear as usual.

10:09.800 --> 10:13.148
Getting in. Sensors on.

10:17.577 --> 10:20.544
We got a self reading at 0.24 procent..

10:20.909 --> 10:23.309
Professor, did you get that?

10:23.404 --> 10:27.120
Mister Cortese would you please
adjust your image stabilizer.

10:27.789 --> 10:28.955
Thank you!

10:29.043 --> 10:32.105
We're in position at 24-30.

10:32.154 --> 10:33.425
GPS Reading...

10:33.520 --> 10:36.921
three meters down four meters...

10:38.068 --> 10:40.637
Temperature six degrees
centigrade and dropping.

10:45.655 --> 10:47.314
We've reached point zero.

10:59.432 --> 11:01.793
I think it's appropriate a
Turkel does the honours.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.705
We're through the seal!

11:46.141 --> 11:50.636
The inner chamber.
It's at least a 100 meters wide.

11:52.078 --> 11:55.926
- Holy shit!
- What is it? What have you found?

11:57.773 --> 11:58.793
"Talos"

11:59.781 --> 12:03.985
In a sarcophagus...
suspended from the ceiling.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.156
..and bodies...
everywhere!

12:07.226 --> 12:11.210
It's nothing like what history
thought us to expect.

12:11.267 --> 12:13.867
Well the history books
are just been rewritten.

12:14.607 --> 12:15.707
Whatever...

12:15.796 --> 12:19.016
They obviously never
wanted this guy to get out.

12:19.750 --> 12:22.049
The dead were interred with the objects

12:22.050 --> 12:24.450
they valued most in life.

12:24.610 --> 12:29.400
It was only proper they should entomb Talos
within his own chamber of horrors

12:38.644 --> 12:41.616
- Professor, Can you see this?
- Yes, Samantha, yes I see it.

12:41.789 --> 12:43.211
It's magnificent..oh..

12:44.815 --> 12:49.505
Worship of the stars was standard
practice. The sun in particular.

12:49.996 --> 12:54.864
Yes, but these are planets...
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.

12:55.257 --> 12:56.369
Perfect alignment!

13:04.510 --> 13:07.005
Cortese, are you al-right?"

13:08.717 --> 13:09.769
cut you off..

13:10.828 --> 13:11.880
Noooo

13:12.004 --> 13:13.004
Brad?

13:13.900 --> 13:15.034
Brad what's wrong

13:15.881 --> 13:17.381
Stop it.....
Brad wil you slow down..

13:17.828 --> 13:18.828
..S t o p I t...

13:18.829 --> 13:20.805
Stop it!

13:20.830 --> 13:21.830
!! Stop it!!

13:24.967 --> 13:26.600
Breathe Brad!

13:26.624 --> 13:28.624
Breathe...

13:28.809 --> 13:30.980
Burke, what are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

13:31.274 --> 13:34.161
- Breathe!
- Burke, what the hell are you doing?

13:37.450 --> 13:39.231
Burke... come back!

13:45.430 --> 13:49.277
Remember that token of our
engagement I never got you.

13:49.375 --> 13:50.876
..about time to do a Cartier!

13:50.912 --> 13:54.768
Fine Burke, you made your point.
You just come down slowly.

13:54.790 --> 13:59.767
The Wadjet eye...
Exquisite

13:59.774 --> 14:04.048
Burke, it's not worth it
it is not worth it...

14:04.897 --> 14:06.471
Burke, don't move!

14:11.277 --> 14:12.477
Burke..

14:18.382 --> 14:20.317
Here you go...

14:22.774 --> 14:26.362
Burke, look I got it now...
just..just come back slowly

14:27.186 --> 14:30.986
aarrgghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

14:33.985 --> 14:35.653
O my!

14:52.119 --> 14:55.037
London, seven months later

14:59.400 --> 15:01.404
- Hi Sam.
- Hi Trouble.

15:12.060 --> 15:14.560
Hello baby.
Are you're hungry, hmm?

15:18.050 --> 15:19.850
In Rome religious leaders from over a dozen

15:20.050 --> 15:22.049
nations agreed that the impending planetary

15:22.050 --> 15:24.049
alignment directly correlates

15:24.050 --> 15:26.049
With the biblical cleansing

15:26.050 --> 15:28.049
known as Judgement Day

15:28.050 --> 15:30.450
Conversely scientist in Geneva
stressed that such an event

15:30.550 --> 15:32.049
has in fact occurred many times

15:32.050 --> 15:34.049
in the past, under the exception

15:34.050 --> 15:36.049
of high tides and possible tremors

15:36.050 --> 15:40.050
should in no way be construed
as a prelude to Armageddon.

15:41.390 --> 15:44.690
The British Museum summons you to the past

15:44.764 --> 15:46.367
the materials presented here

15:46.674 --> 15:50.223
were recovered form a hidden
chamber in the Valley of the Kings

15:50.318 --> 15:55.519
the wrappings are all that
remains of the Mummy: Talos lonPey

15:56.217 --> 16:03.157
Ladies and gentlemen, the museum is now closed
please make your way to the nearest exit

16:03.450 --> 16:05.654
Thank you for your cooperation.

16:05.690 --> 16:08.883
Excuse me Sir, I am afraid
we're closed for this evening.

16:09.517 --> 16:11.881
Professor, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize it was you.

16:11.906 --> 16:14.269
No need to apologize
for doing your job Carl.

16:15.704 --> 16:19.614
Oh, I didn't know it was so late.
Time stands still for no-one he?

16:21.380 --> 16:23.114
Wouldn't you agree Prince?

16:24.749 --> 16:27.725
Uh, this way Professor. Please let
me show you to the south wing.

17:01.516 --> 17:02.516
Carl?

17:05.367 --> 17:06.896
My God!!

17:08.402 --> 17:10.808
We had a break in, room 32. One man down!

17:11.362 --> 17:14.440
Request medical assistance!
I'll open the gate.

17:28.016 --> 17:30.241
Hold on don't move him just yet.

17:30.266 --> 17:33.096
The Americans are sending down
one from their lot to take a look.

17:33.700 --> 17:37.280
Very well. We do not want to
create an international incident.

17:38.133 --> 17:43.143
He was Terence Moore, United States Senate.
Here on holiday.

17:43.882 --> 17:46.150
I knew he had to be pretty hot
to get you out of bed..

17:49.498 --> 17:53.018
- Jesus Christ
- Very clean.

17:54.868 --> 17:58.098
Both eyes extracted with the
optic nerve fully intact.

17:59.116 --> 18:01.222
- What for?
- What do you mean what for?

18:02.965 --> 18:05.463
There is no reasonable explanation
for an act of this kind.

18:05.550 --> 18:07.427
In the mind of the killer there was...

18:07.670 --> 18:10.905
- And you are?
- That's detective Riley, US Embassy.

18:15.855 --> 18:18.604
Like you said, not done
with an ice-cream scooper.

18:18.629 --> 18:20.999
Nah, that's precision
hand at work here.

18:21.152 --> 18:24.415
Do you know if the eyes were removed
before or after the neck got crushed?

18:25.016 --> 18:26.454
O my God, I should hope after!

18:27.000 --> 18:28.180
Well we can all hope.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.428
But maybe our killer prefers to see his
victims suffer a little before they go.

18:31.520 --> 18:35.188
Victims? Excuse me aren't we jumping
just a bit ahead of ourselves.

18:35.267 --> 18:36.427
What'd you find on him?

18:36.452 --> 18:39.434
Eh, credit cards, Rolex,
pretty much everything

18:39.554 --> 18:43.707
He wasn't mugged for his money!
This wasn't a thrill kill.

18:45.319 --> 18:49.578
- Look, I need all details.
- You'll have to wait for the post-mortal..

18:49.927 --> 18:53.584
- OkÃ©, why you still here?
- Let's go...

19:02.124 --> 19:05.176
He's probably watching us right now.
Hoping we'll appreciate the effort.

19:36.674 --> 19:40.390
SAM
PLEASE READ

19:41.612 --> 19:45.379
..PLEASE BELIEVE

19:54.958 --> 19:58.224
THE TRUTH

20:02.373 --> 20:05.398
Dr. Mulrooney...
that man's been phoning all morning.

20:08.843 --> 20:11.788
Sounds stark raving mad,
do me a favour will you,

20:11.813 --> 20:15.037
if he calls again, tell
him I've been transferred.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.727
Thank you..

21:11.846 --> 21:13.736
Stoopid.. Start..

23:07.758 --> 23:10.025
So we got two victims.
First one's eyes

23:10.050 --> 23:12.713
couldn't be seen. Second
one looses their lungs

23:13.094 --> 23:16.765
- What else they have in common?
- They're both foreigners..

23:16.910 --> 23:20.425
- Right. So what does this tell you?
- They weren't chosen at random.

23:20.958 --> 23:24.415
Good, so eh.. find out
if Grasby had any ties,

23:24.500 --> 23:27.394
occupational whatever,
to the American, and eh..

23:27.579 --> 23:30.251
..call the consulate, see if there's
any relatives we can talk to.

23:32.031 --> 23:33.106
Erm..give me that..

23:38.247 --> 23:40.012
- Ah
- What's that?

23:40.703 --> 23:42.542
Looks like Gauze

23:44.681 --> 23:46.128
I know that smell

23:48.089 --> 23:50.813
that's spice...
.. cinnamon

23:52.517 --> 23:54.956
Don't worry, I'm a little
wizard in the kitchen

23:55.000 --> 23:56.451
Pussywhipped is what you are

23:56.500 --> 23:57.800
Yeah, you should go out more...

24:00.960 --> 24:05.075
Pass, me water!

24:05.126 --> 24:06.126
Thanks.

24:20.022 --> 24:24.694
Oh, hello Bradley. Looking
uncommonly insane these days.

24:24.891 --> 24:29.882
I think I mentioned that you look pretty
chic yourself. And of course there's

24:29.907 --> 24:34.608
also that bug that's crawling right up your
arse, is still alive and kicking Clair!

24:34.674 --> 24:38.340
- Now... Why wouldn't you take my calls?
- Let go of my arm.

24:38.406 --> 24:42.240
- Why wont you take my calls?!
- You want me to call the guard?

24:45.084 --> 24:47.308
I tell you, you know it's started don't you?

24:48.074 --> 24:51.058
We found it, we're responsible and we
got three days to find it again.

24:51.930 --> 24:54.394
Take some advice, Bradley okÃ©

24:54.400 --> 24:58.575
Take the same three days and find
yourself a really good shrink.

24:58.770 --> 25:01.514
Please look, if we don't find
this thing... if we don't find...

25:01.654 --> 25:04.625
What thing? I mean
Bradley, there never was a

25:04.650 --> 25:07.684
thing. Talos is dust, if
he ever even existed!

25:07.906 --> 25:12.620
What about the museum.. what about the museum?
What about three deaths in one week, Claire!!

25:13.451 --> 25:15.856
..you don't see, but I can see..

25:16.708 --> 25:23.868
- see, I see, I see everything!
- Jesus Christ
- Listen to me, let me be your guide..

25:23.911 --> 25:28.044
Oh you know eh, if it's all the same
to you I'll take the unguided tour.

25:28.212 --> 25:31.532
Claire,
Thursday 10:55

25:31.843 --> 25:36.845
If it is not stopped, it's gonna be the beginning
of the end of the world for all the time..

26:23.826 --> 26:27.694
- Hey... you want to make a move?
- I need to take a leak first.

27:43.906 --> 27:46.562
Sir Richard Turkel Research Foundation

27:46.880 --> 27:50.358
Miss Turkel's office?
Thank you.

27:59.538 --> 28:00.538
Yes?

28:01.552 --> 28:06.207
- I am looking for a Miss Turkel
- That's me. How can I help?

28:06.280 --> 28:09.191
If you can spare a few
minutes away from your work?

28:09.203 --> 28:11.973
Yes, sure..
Um.. just carry on..

28:14.804 --> 28:18.727
I just so happens that that
worthless pile of rags is priceless..

28:18.781 --> 28:21.548
- Only to people like yourself.
- Hah, right!

28:21.820 --> 28:23.214
Does that make me a suspect then?

28:23.674 --> 28:28.110
Merely an expert. Mister Bradley
Cortese, you hear from him lately?

28:28.727 --> 28:32.871
He's just fired from another job last week.
Been MIA ever since.

28:33.951 --> 28:36.542
I see from your reaction, he's
more then just a colleague?

28:37.594 --> 28:39.386
What's that supposed to imply?

28:39.648 --> 28:43.510
I level with you Miss Turkel, our
suspect profile points to an

28:43.550 --> 28:47.004
unstable individual with serous
ties with this Talos exhibit.

28:47.070 --> 28:48.639
..You're looking in the wrong place..

28:48.640 --> 28:53.077
Brad, has his problems, yes.
But violence is not one of them.

28:53.862 --> 28:56.977
Were you and Cortese lovers?

28:57.955 --> 29:01.298
I don't think that is any of your
business, one way or the other.

29:01.861 --> 29:04.672
I am only concerned for
your safety, Miss Turkel.

29:05.741 --> 29:08.001
Bottom-line, if our man is linked to this exhibit

29:08.711 --> 29:09.942
- He is linked to me..

29:10.308 --> 29:11.841
I'll be extra cautious, Detective.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.100
My pager..

29:17.728 --> 29:21.050
If there's anything you need.
Day or Night.

29:26.490 --> 29:31.390
In fact there is something. My grandfather's logbook
was one of the items ceased from the museum..

29:31.846 --> 29:33.432
When can I expect it back?

29:34.887 --> 29:38.770
It's just that I ..um..
It means the world to me..

29:38.987 --> 29:43.395
You have my word, you get it back
the second we're done with it.

29:44.007 --> 29:47.254
Well, let's see if you're a man of his word.

29:52.511 --> 29:55.244
Our victims turn three arrived at
Heathrow on September the seventh.

29:55.642 --> 29:57.642
But they're on different airlines..

29:57.810 --> 29:59.510
Security reported nothing unusual.

29:59.517 --> 30:01.392
Most likely he targeted them when they landed.

30:03.912 --> 30:06.006
..Oh for God sake!

30:08.183 --> 30:12.257
Postal service, mister Cortese. I got a packet
that needs a signature.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.946
Mister Cortese?

30:51.290 --> 30:52.890
Shit!!

It looks like, you and Cortese
are on to the same Princess.

31:38.285 --> 31:40.767
I'll get a car over to her place.

31:54.561 --> 31:57.540

Barton are you're okay? Barton?

32:04.726 --> 32:09.084
- Barton?
- Erh perfect..

32:09.149 --> 32:10.549
Shit!!

32:29.151 --> 32:31.422
- Detective?
- Miss Turkel.

32:31.469 --> 32:36.263
- This couldn't be a coincidence.
- It could, but isn't.

32:36.618 --> 32:39.224
I've found this in Cortese's flat

32:39.430 --> 32:42.194
I could use some of your experts advise.

32:42.434 --> 32:43.509
What?

32:44.533 --> 32:47.158
Let's get to my office.

32:49.314 --> 32:50.654
Good news for a change?

32:51.593 --> 32:53.588
Business as usual, eh Doc..

32:56.947 --> 32:59.455
- Night
- Night night

34:27.925 --> 34:30.089
OkÃ©, this is the ..eh.. core of the myth..

34:31.205 --> 34:36.855
According to the inscriptions Talos had the organs
intentionally removed from his body by his own followers.

34:36.904 --> 34:40.521
The cult believed that one day their
Prince would come back and reclaim them.

34:40.560 --> 34:43.245
These organs were they taken
in a particular order?

34:44.641 --> 34:47.587
The Eyes..
The lungs..

34:48.485 --> 34:54.326
The pituitary gland..
The liver... the jaw

34:55.324 --> 34:57.240
last but not least

34:58.919 --> 35:00.046
the Heart..

35:00.108 --> 35:04.092
What's it mean?
Resurrection?

35:05.537 --> 35:09.332
- Well more accurately transmutation
- oh a scrabble word.

35:09.861 --> 35:11.354
It's a term the alchemists used..

35:12.024 --> 35:17.428
It means to ..um.. restore man to his
prime-ordeal condition of grace..

35:17.687 --> 35:23.924
Strength, perfection and..
Eh.. physical immortality.

35:35.087 --> 35:37.280
So what happens now?

35:37.512 --> 35:41.745
He gets picked up, hopefully before
he commits his next atrocity.

35:41.922 --> 35:44.094
- Yeah, that is if he
committed any to begin with.

35:44.170 --> 35:47.018
For your friends sake, why don't you
tell me what you think is going on.

35:47.030 --> 35:51.601
- Because Riley, you'd never believe me. Not in..
- 3,000 years?

35:56.958 --> 35:57.974
Hey listen..

35:57.998 --> 36:03.436
I have been on the Gold dig myself, and I
just happen to know a fine Irish pub

36:04.510 --> 36:09.032
A cop named Riley knows a fine
Irish pub, you surprise me..

36:09.063 --> 36:14.042
- Am I still wasting my time Miss Turkel?
- Why don't you call me Sam.

36:40.999 --> 36:45.799
Edith..., I am the worlds only saviour!

36:45.858 --> 36:49.030
Well then it's your obligation to
tell the authorities what you saw.

36:53.886 --> 36:57.470

36:58.094 --> 37:01.217

I'm going with you..

37:09.422 --> 37:15.081
Put the phone, putt the... putt
the phone down... Edith now!!

37:15.256 --> 37:17.383
You need to help, Bradley

37:17.648 --> 37:22.795
I know bloody shit Sherlock, and you Edith are it

37:23.603 --> 37:26.664
You are not gonna deny me Edith
you're not gonna deny me!

37:30.869 --> 37:34.838
I want you Edith to take me to
the eyes of his next victim..

37:40.043 --> 37:43.791
I feel ashamed to admit, I gave very
little thought of Burke's death

37:44.487 --> 37:46.713
You're defences were up?

37:47.232 --> 37:48.232
No..

37:50.316 --> 37:55.675
My mind was on that sarcophagus...
and the wrappings..

37:58.312 --> 37:59.904
Heh...
the un-presence

38:00.798 --> 38:05.200
For weeks and no one would go
near them not even the flies

38:06.697 --> 38:09.847
They just lie there,
half buried in the sand

38:10.443 --> 38:14.687
And madness to go to the camp... and
none of us seem to have any control over

38:15.819 --> 38:20.632
It affected everyone..
Each in totally different ways

38:20.792 --> 38:25.522
it was the darkness...
you could.. we could feel

38:34.827 --> 38:35.827
You're cut off

38:41.752 --> 38:44.207
I wasn't the only one who felt it, Riley

38:45.205 --> 38:48.606
It had power. It was tangible

39:04.306 --> 39:06.414
Argh, my heart's racing

39:06.785 --> 39:08.933
That because it's not yours
it belongs to the other

39:11.069 --> 39:13.302
Gonna bust out of my chest

39:16.114 --> 39:18.631
Remember this isn't your vision..

39:22.958 --> 39:28.006
- OkÃ©, I'm ready, Edith.
- Release! Open your eyes

39:43.303 --> 39:44.636
Where are you, Bradley?

39:45.194 --> 39:46.839
Still in London

39:49.934 --> 39:51.820
I'm going down some stairs

39:52.000 --> 39:57.208
It's cold. I'm walking..
I'm walking on my hands..

40:09.495 --> 40:13.578
I know what stop it is..
I know where he's going, Edith!

40:13.674 --> 40:14.974
Let's go!

40:16.557 --> 40:18.269
Get out of the way!

40:28.927 --> 40:32.312
..get out of my way..
..out of my way..

40:39.099 --> 40:41.410
What's happening Queeny?
What do you smell?

40:42.079 --> 40:43.967
Al-right then, go and get your supper.

40:51.719 --> 40:54.853
What's up girl.
What's happening?

40:56.782 --> 40:58.950
O my god... Queeny what's the matter?

40:59.259 --> 41:01.665
Get out of the way
get out... of the way

41:03.639 --> 41:08.451
Queeny, Queeny come on!!
Queeny! Queeny!

41:13.425 --> 41:15.583
What have you done to my dog?

41:18.072 --> 41:19.272
Enough!!

41:20.615 --> 41:21.615
Killer!

41:21.954 --> 41:25.945
- you stupid bastard..You don't understand.
- Where's my dog?
- You don't understand.

41:26.011 --> 41:29.112
- Where is my dog?
- Get off me!!

41:31.992 --> 41:35.159
- You okay to go up alone?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.

41:36.671 --> 41:38.662
Brad knows better than to show up here.

41:38.718 --> 41:43.519
It's not Brad you're afraid of.
Go on say the name: Talos

41:56.330 --> 41:58.413
I think Brad heard voices.

41:58.847 --> 42:04.758
I didn't tell you first hand that he .. is dangerously
obsessed with this whole .. past lives theme.

42:05.825 --> 42:07.756
Maybe..

42:11.164 --> 42:16.164
But what if just this once, the voices
that somebody was hearing were real?

42:21.512 --> 42:22.987
Night Riley..

43:00.052 --> 43:02.829
Disgusting Bastards

44:04.108 --> 44:05.990
Argh..
Oh shit!

44:11.509 --> 44:15.525
- Dispatch to Riley, over.
- What's up?

44:15.546 --> 44:19.115
Bradley Cortese has been spotted in
the vicinity of Notting Hill Gate

44:19.144 --> 44:20.687
Shit!

44:52.291 --> 44:54.628
No, I don't hear you...

45:01.934 --> 45:04.183
- hello?
- Got ya!

45:05.722 --> 45:07.570
Brad, um .. I can't
talk right now,

45:07.595 --> 45:10.174
Don't hang up, don't hang up,
I'm gonna go crazy if ya hang up!

45:10.250 --> 45:13.207
Brad, I'm on my way out I have a date.

45:13.287 --> 45:16.024
O, with that cop, is that your date?
That cop that lied to me?

45:16.660 --> 45:18.828
Where are you?

45:19.858 --> 45:23.538
You sound scared, Sam...
I don't blame you..

45:28.520 --> 45:30.042
- You should be.
- O god, Brad!

45:33.200 --> 45:37.054
What are you doing here?
What happened? Whose blood is it?

45:37.959 --> 45:44.726
- It's not mine
- Whose is it?
- It's from the one he.. eh.. got before you.

45:45.348 --> 45:46.648
What are you talking about?

45:46.678 --> 45:50.606
He wants what you got, Sam!
You can't let him take it..

45:50.991 --> 45:54.959
Help me... help me by saying you understand?
Please...

45:54.973 --> 45:58.381
Of course I understand,
I was there remember, Yeah?

46:04.100 --> 46:07.056
- Kneel down, Sam
- wha .. what?

46:08.069 --> 46:09.202
- Kneel down..
- What?

46:10.570 --> 46:12.570
For what?
What are you doing?

46:14.319 --> 46:15.489
You don't need to worry..

46:15.513 --> 46:18.456
I will see, I will see you on the flip side.

46:18.457 --> 46:21.075
I don't know what you're talking about.
Stop this Brad.

46:21.089 --> 46:25.699
Don't worry, because I'm
gonna be right behind you...

46:25.775 --> 46:26.950
Please...

46:27.204 --> 46:31.769
Brad, stop it!
What are you doinggg?!

46:32.712 --> 46:33.735
Brad stop!

46:34.256 --> 46:36.867
- Brad!!
- forgive me, Sam
- Noooo!

46:47.063 --> 46:48.063
Can't resist.

47:02.887 --> 47:07.116
For the purpose of this interview Mr.Cortese agreed
to wave his rights to have a lawyer present.

47:07.354 --> 47:09.845
It's not a lawyer I need, it's a undertaker.

47:11.335 --> 47:16.011
Cause you are talking to a dead man..
Dead man talking..

47:18.082 --> 47:19.837
Why do you want to harm Miss Turkel?

47:20.050 --> 47:25.761
Don't wanna harm her, she's my family.
It's like a bloody sister.

47:25.762 --> 47:30.293
What about them? Were they like
your brothers and sisters?

47:33.547 --> 47:34.947
No...

47:35.262 --> 47:39.471
Take a good look. Did he piss you off?

47:40.017 --> 47:44.465
No, not him. It's just it..
.. it's what inside him

47:46.225 --> 47:47.677
His Liver

47:47.860 --> 47:50.920
Yes, 'officer Dibble', his
liver pissed me off!!

47:52.838 --> 47:58.305
If you can't have a pass to piss you off,
you can't let out the anger, is that it?

47:59.683 --> 48:01.790
Mmm, what if it blows your head back, baby?

48:03.425 --> 48:06.334
- You smug bastard!
- Barton!

48:09.919 --> 48:12.151
- Go get some air

48:15.365 --> 48:17.165
See ya..

48:21.676 --> 48:24.668
Your mate is... a tad pissed off, I can tell...

48:24.914 --> 48:28.239
Naturally. He is convinced that we have our man.

48:28.318 --> 48:34.455
- O, no not me, officer Dibble it's someone else.
- Then prove him wrong! ....Who?

48:37.825 --> 48:39.751
I tell you for a fag.

48:49.682 --> 48:54.030
You see your mystery, officer..
Started about 3,000 years ago.

48:54.405 --> 48:58.571
And your suspect was a Greek
heretic exiled from his home land..

48:58.617 --> 49:01.855
..for performing acts of .. sorcery..

49:03.985 --> 49:08.930
His name was, and still is: Talos.

49:13.222 --> 49:18.088
Five years later a man called Talos
Ionpey arrived in ancient Egypt.

49:18.155 --> 49:22.287
He was cultured, he was charming,
he is a master of language, mathematics..

49:22.383 --> 49:24.062
And... the dark science.

49:25.094 --> 49:31.343
This impressed King Amenhotep, and Talos quickly
became part of the royal family inner circle..

49:31.361 --> 49:37.106
Not long after he wed the King's
stunning daughter Nefrianna..

49:39.716 --> 49:42.842
Ah, Nefrianna worshipped her dark Prince..

49:42.922 --> 49:47.537
Those who opposed his particular brand of
theology were struck down with disease.

49:47.549 --> 49:51.600
Or worse, he tortured to believe him!

49:52.921 --> 50:00.098
They bring factions, pleaded with King Amenhotep to
put an end to this mad foreigners reign of terror

50:00.105 --> 50:03.221
So you see... an assassination was plotted

50:03.661 --> 50:07.980
But again the poor old King miscalculated.

50:08.664 --> 50:11.758
He informed Nefrianna of his intended deed.

50:11.785 --> 50:15.332
And she in return told her Dark Prince.

50:17.174 --> 50:20.314
Talos decided if he was going to die,

50:20.858 --> 50:22.727
it will be on his own terms..

50:23.972 --> 50:27.785
The Kings battalion stormed the chamber.

50:28.045 --> 50:30.755
But the Prince had come up with the perfect plan..

50:31.255 --> 50:34.596
..to preserve his soul, for his eventual return

50:35.407 --> 50:36.813
Mummification!!!

50:37.729 --> 50:41.173
But for the King the worst
horror was yet to come..

50:41.269 --> 50:46.153
For deep inside the chamber
the embalmers were discovered

50:46.227 --> 50:50.668
Cannibalizing Prince Talos his organs..

50:50.710 --> 50:53.891
His own daughter chewing on the heart..

50:53.977 --> 50:57.570
Well, the King promptly put
the followers to death..

50:57.969 --> 51:02.315
He himself impaling Nefrianna upon the spikes..

51:03.557 --> 51:04.599
And Talos?

51:05.042 --> 51:10.307
Talos?
Well you see, his body was never found!

51:12.054 --> 51:14.071
Only the wrappings.

51:14.166 --> 51:19.516
And inscribed inside the chamber
it says that his soul ..

51:19.546 --> 51:24.177
'Kah'... awaits in purgatory
until the day of his rebirth.

51:25.022 --> 51:28.559
Which happens to be this Thursday.

51:30.062 --> 51:33.579
At 10:55. When the planets align?

51:37.231 --> 51:39.083
So these four victims...

51:39.609 --> 51:42.704
.. are all reincarnations of his followers

51:43.029 --> 51:46.825
No, officer Riley, it's five you see.
You're forgetting the dog.

51:46.910 --> 51:50.402
Who said you have to come
back wearing the same skin?

51:52.013 --> 51:54.768
..You still don't get it, do ya?

51:54.806 --> 51:59.582
Don't you see he taking back his organs?
So he can live again..

52:02.054 --> 52:07.757
I saw Nefrianna's face in that chamber.
I saw Sam's face!

52:08.863 --> 52:15.486
She is the final carrier. Her grandfather
was the final link in the chain!

52:15.488 --> 52:18.434
It fed them . . the moment
that tomb was uncovered.

52:18.459 --> 52:24.981
She is not responsible for the crimes of her
forefathers, but she is accountable for their sins!

52:27.797 --> 52:29.636
..kill her!

52:31.966 --> 52:33.147
Fuck off!!

52:33.150 --> 52:36.688
God .. Someone has to destroy the heart!

52:39.690 --> 52:44.419
Take a look, take a look and see mush
..seeing that's believing.

52:55.178 --> 52:57.005
Believe!

53:00.561 --> 53:01.612
Believe..

53:04.145 --> 53:08.200
- Inspector, what's the word on Cortese?
- We're holding him till morning.

53:08.398 --> 53:09.849
Where do you want me to stick him?

53:10.450 --> 53:14.492
I could make a suggestion..
Eh..stick him in number 5.

53:23.782 --> 53:30.426
Brad, not moving you until tomorrow. We can do
this the nice and easy way or the bullshit one.

53:31.178 --> 53:34.436
- Well, the nice and easy way every time.
- That's a change..

53:37.311 --> 53:41.514
- Shit! It's started.
- What did we just say?! No bullocks!

53:42.131 --> 53:43.501
- Get out of here

53:47.597 --> 53:49.327
O, hello..

53:56.459 --> 53:57.553
I'm sorry

54:07.675 --> 54:09.203
Jesus!

54:42.769 --> 54:44.327
How's he doing?

54:44.901 --> 54:47.863
He get himself a padded cell.
Double security

54:49.008 --> 54:50.735
It's better than his victims

54:55.426 --> 54:57.439
Hand delivered as promised.

54:59.572 --> 55:04.102
Look for whatever reason, that tomb
brought grief to a good number of people.

55:05.229 --> 55:07.301
.. If it means anything..

55:08.465 --> 55:11.893
I think maybe your grandfather
had the right idea all along.

55:12.665 --> 55:14.358
Thanks..

55:16.453 --> 55:18.920
Coming from you, it does..

55:23.560 --> 55:26.276
(TV) We interrupt our regular
programming to bring you this

55:26.301 --> 55:29.082
live on the scene bulletin from
the City Police Headquarters..

55:29.085 --> 55:31.933
Two corpses are now being
removed by medical personnel

55:32.006 --> 55:34.290
One of the deceased is believed
to be a Detective Barton

55:34.315 --> 55:36.397
a leading officer in the
grizzly murders that began..

55:38.128 --> 55:41.914
Stay indoors until you hear from me, you have
round the clock protection untill he's nailed.

55:41.942 --> 55:44.896
- Forget it, I'm coming with you..
- Sam please, I have no time to argue.

55:45.333 --> 55:49.429
OkÃ© Riley, on one condition, you give me your
word this is not come off until I take it off.

55:49.454 --> 55:53.994
Is this a joke, you see what's happening out
there? - Yeah, it is a joke .. you and me?

56:29.622 --> 56:34.263
Instant Cadaveric Spasm, it's
obvious from the discolouration..

56:34.325 --> 56:38.109
And severe trauma to the
neck, crushed the vertebrae.

56:38.138 --> 56:41.607
Happened just like that!
I don't imagine he suffered much.

56:45.730 --> 56:46.835
Tea?

56:47.133 --> 56:51.710
In Point effect is N. Rope loop, five letters.

56:52.587 --> 56:55.374
- Noose.
- No, I meant a spot of tea

56:55.410 --> 56:56.598
You know, like Lipton's

56:57.304 --> 57:01.889
- O, sounds lovely.
- how are you on lemon?
- Lemon, Thank you!

57:57.853 --> 57:59.706
Help! Someone help me!

58:04.901 --> 58:07.333
Help!
Let me in!!

58:07.790 --> 58:10.590
Sam, Sam what is going on?

58:10.914 --> 58:15.638
- There's something out there..
- wha what.. No no no,
- There's something out there!!

58:16.443 --> 58:18.234
It's Sam from 28. She's upset..

58:19.231 --> 58:21.866
- It's Sam from 28
- There is nothing there, please no

59:39.669 --> 59:42.814
.Help... Stop!
Please help me..

59:43.803 --> 59:45.103
Stop!
Please....!

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.300
- Eye witnesses?
- A whole bunch.. all dead

01:00:47.442 --> 01:00:49.253
If cats could talk, he?

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.107
Evening Standard

01:01:24.165 --> 01:01:31.096
Only ten hours to go, read all about it
four planets unite... Eeeevening Standard.

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:38.829
"Edith Butros, you pleased
to make my acquaintance.

01:01:39.005 --> 01:01:44.398
This is .. Detective Riley, I came across
your card in Brad Cortese's apartment.

01:01:44.479 --> 01:01:49.360
- What sort of trouble is he in now?
- I'm afraid he is way past all that.

01:01:49.615 --> 01:01:51.581
Brad's dead?

01:01:51.582 --> 01:01:55.770
He was saying some..eh ..
Unusual things before he went..

01:01:57.139 --> 01:02:00.802
- Too unusual to believe
- Well you believe him..

01:02:02.304 --> 01:02:04.218
Yeah, just about..

01:02:04.313 --> 01:02:05.879
Al-right..

01:02:07.407 --> 01:02:09.767
I'll do what I can for you.

01:02:09.917 --> 01:02:13.655
Thank you.
Goodbye.

01:02:15.715 --> 01:02:18.892
Professor Marcus, I'm detective Riley.

01:02:18.975 --> 01:02:22.762
Ah yes, yes, yes.
I came as soon as I received your message.

01:02:23.472 --> 01:02:25.285
Any further news about Sam?

01:02:25.361 --> 01:02:29.918
Not yet... I've spoken with Dr. Mulrooney,
and she's agreed to rendezvous.

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:31.687
Ah begrudgingly, I'm sure.

01:02:32.905 --> 01:02:35.842
So you believe that this thing has gone after Sam

01:02:35.845 --> 01:02:37.908
..to eh .. reclaim it's heart?

01:02:38.377 --> 01:02:42.808
According to Bradley the final piece of the
puzzle resides within her bosom.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:47.009
Bradley Cortese is a psychotic,
listen to yourself! This is insane!

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.369
Or it's prophecy!

01:02:48.864 --> 01:02:51.066
We have less than five hours to find her.

01:02:51.083 --> 01:02:54.215
Does anybody have reasonable suggestions?

01:02:54.258 --> 01:02:57.520
Well, I have one somewhat unorthodox one.

01:02:57.585 --> 01:03:02.284
Why am I not surprised, it
involves the spirit world no doubt.

01:03:02.326 --> 01:03:06.865
- We need a vessel to contact her.
- Something with spiritual resonance.

01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:11.541
You know for Sam I was willing to listen to
anything bordering on the rational, but this..

01:03:11.844 --> 01:03:13.484
Claire please..

01:03:14.027 --> 01:03:15.933
Doctor wait... Wait, wait, wait

01:03:17.443 --> 01:03:21.739
Look I don't expect you to put your faith
into something I only half believe myself.

01:03:21.812 --> 01:03:26.373
But if there's a chance, one shot in a million, that
what that woman claims she can do, will help find Sam..

01:03:26.764 --> 01:03:28.228
I am willing to give it a try.

01:03:31.235 --> 01:03:36.415
Look eh, I'm scared okÃ©, I mean,
you can understand that can't you?

01:03:38.094 --> 01:03:41.389
Yes.
Absolutely.

01:03:43.893 --> 01:03:47.876
Al-right, you win, what do you need?

01:04:20.196 --> 01:04:24.029
You're with "Samantha now
what is she showing you?

01:04:27.051 --> 01:04:30.349
- Look I am sorry, but am I the only one..
- Doctor please, please..

01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:32.934
Excuse me, but I mean
she talking to a dead body..

01:04:33.149 --> 01:04:36.868
Death doesn't exist, it's
only a transference of energies.

01:04:37.121 --> 01:04:39.705
And if we can tap into his before it moves on..

01:04:52.327 --> 01:04:54.004
He's found her..

01:04:58.969 --> 01:05:00.238
Ask her to guide you..

01:05:06.017 --> 01:05:07.820
Have her show you where she is!

01:05:10.484 --> 01:05:13.908
- Al-right, let's concentrate.
- Give me your hands..

01:05:14.589 --> 01:05:16.217
Close your eyes..

01:05:25.652 --> 01:05:27.101
Help!

01:05:52.508 --> 01:05:56.028
- This can't be happening
- Where is she, Brad?

01:05:57.338 --> 01:05:59.031
Tell us what she sees?

01:06:07.806 --> 01:06:14.537
Bradley, her eyes are your eyes!
Have her tell us what she sees!

01:06:35.766 --> 01:06:37.499
The Pyramid Hotel

01:06:45.922 --> 01:06:49.206
What do you see?!
Bradley?

01:06:56.094 --> 01:06:57.482
Where is she, Bradley?

01:07:11.622 --> 01:07:16.133
- I saw that...
- Yeah, I saw that..

01:07:20.092 --> 01:07:21.092
Bradley...!

01:07:37.146 --> 01:07:40.079
Symbols? What do they mean?

01:07:40.661 --> 01:07:41.910
Literal translation

01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:47.092
Under the pyramid..
On the water.

01:07:47.152 --> 01:07:49.272
Does it trigger anything?

01:07:50.251 --> 01:07:52.167
No, I'm afraid not.

01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:58.575
You know there's a construction site on the Thames?
The skeleton of one of those old super Hotels.

01:07:58.683 --> 01:08:02.494
Ah yes, I remember. During the
initial phase... a level collapsed.

01:08:02.723 --> 01:08:04.692
A completion was suspended..

01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:06.300
Sound like his kind of hotel..

01:08:06.332 --> 01:08:11.714
Yes, but if it were, I mean, how do you stop
something that hasn't died in 3000 years?

01:08:38.953 --> 01:08:42.225
The wadjetâs eye symbolizes
the left eye of Horus..

01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:45.010
.. Ripped out during his battle with Seth!

01:08:45.568 --> 01:08:50.906
It possesses extraordinary powers of protection,
we must keep it with us at all times.

01:08:50.915 --> 01:08:55.971
What you mean this is it. This is our only
weapon against this force you been describing?

01:09:07.765 --> 01:09:08.790
Fuck!

01:09:16.578 --> 01:09:18.826
Waterloo bridge is our best hope.
Now step on it!

01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:22.055
We never make it through the gridlock
do you know an alternate route?

01:09:22.095 --> 01:09:23.959
What about this one?

01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:06.829
This is it..

01:11:10.096 --> 01:11:11.124
Stand clear

01:11:19.906 --> 01:11:21.219
Come on..

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.876
Watch your step..
Hurry up!

01:11:31.542 --> 01:11:34.777
- Only 18 minutes left.. How's your ankle holding out?
- I'll be fine!

01:11:35.973 --> 01:11:36.973
Let's Go!

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.319
I have defeated..

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.319
..the will..

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.320
..of Amon Ra!
Never before..

01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:39.994
..have human eyes..

01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:42.900
..feasted upon such ...splendorrr.

01:12:43.571 --> 01:12:46.166
Rise and Kneel at the feet of Talos

01:12:51.965 --> 01:12:55.631
Nefrianna, does not kneel
at the order of infidels..

01:12:57.349 --> 01:12:58.349
What!!

01:13:17.933 --> 01:13:19.901
Ah, she could be anywhere..

01:13:19.954 --> 01:13:23.734
So why don't we split up?
That way we can cover more ground!

01:13:24.449 --> 01:13:26.916
Yes, yes good idea.
Come, we go this way.

01:13:34.508 --> 01:13:35.980
This way.. yes?

01:13:50.658 --> 01:13:55.408
- Damn!
- It's OK, it's OK I got light
- I got ya...

01:14:12.255 --> 01:14:13.324
Talos!

01:14:14.071 --> 01:14:17.988
- Good evening Professor Marcus.
- You know my name!!

01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:20.239
As I know your mind..

01:14:20.571 --> 01:14:26.219
Countless hours spend at the museum
you stand there in my funerary containment..

01:14:26.309 --> 01:14:30.060
Wondering what it would be
like to speak to a deity?

01:14:30.069 --> 01:14:34.150
- Yes.. yes
- No!!

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:38.224
Fight him.. Professor, he's trying
to control your mind. Fight him!

01:14:44.252 --> 01:14:49.434
Begone, less you feel these knives of light!
The mighty Amon Ra commands you!!

01:14:49.801 --> 01:14:51.058
Begone!
Begone!!

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.063
Begone!!!

01:15:00.082 --> 01:15:01.505
Begone!!

01:15:03.538 --> 01:15:06.639
We did it professor.
We did it..

01:15:11.137 --> 01:15:12.524
Be quiet Butros..

01:15:14.826 --> 01:15:19.391
Be quiet!
On your knees in worship!

01:15:24.483 --> 01:15:27.950
O my goodness, what have I done?

01:15:29.964 --> 01:15:31.254
What have I done?

01:15:33.584 --> 01:15:35.082
The light..

01:15:35.161 --> 01:15:36.596
- We have 6 minutes!
- OkÃ©

01:15:45.423 --> 01:15:47.414
Look I can't wait. We are out of time!
- I know..

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.040
Here give me that!

01:15:50.095 --> 01:15:53.148
Now go on, come on who's the doctor?

01:16:58.605 --> 01:17:01.305
Gender: Male - Age: 35
Deliver to: Dr.Claire Mulrooney

01:17:10.977 --> 01:17:13.652
Professor, there no time for that!

01:17:14.254 --> 01:17:17.852
- Doctor! Where is Mr. Riley?
- O don't worry about him..

01:17:19.055 --> 01:17:20.947
What you doing with our palm reader?

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:27.189
No no, not me. That thing, it came to me.
I couldn't fight it back

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:29.236
What thing, Marcus?

01:17:31.451 --> 01:17:32.982
There's nothing here...

01:17:35.898 --> 01:17:40.361
Well, you were right,
extraordinary powers of protection.

01:17:40.536 --> 01:17:41.624
Talos!

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:46.178
It came to you didn't it.
What did it promise you?

01:17:48.436 --> 01:17:51.535
Pompous arse.
Who are you to speak his name?

01:17:51.948 --> 01:17:54.469
You created the history you teach

01:17:55.344 --> 01:17:59.602
What are you saying?
Where is Mr. Riley?

01:17:59.643 --> 01:18:05.110
Exactly where he is suppose to be...
At exactly the right moment!

01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:12.572
O my Prince..

01:18:33.844 --> 01:18:34.844
Sam?

01:18:39.115 --> 01:18:40.115
Sam!

01:18:45.857 --> 01:18:46.933
Sam!

01:18:48.745 --> 01:18:49.829
Riley!

01:18:54.755 --> 01:18:55.849
Sam!

01:18:59.081 --> 01:19:02.162
- It's all real..
- I know..

01:19:07.968 --> 01:19:09.004
Get away from her!

01:19:18.627 --> 01:19:20.781
Now your time has come, Princess!

01:19:22.638 --> 01:19:24.399
Don't let him win, Riley!

01:19:25.901 --> 01:19:27.654
Don't let him win..

01:19:27.904 --> 01:19:32.109
Do it! Do it now!

01:19:33.648 --> 01:19:36.941
I am very sorry ..
You'll never have your princess

01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:49.000
I've already have my princess

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.559
The female served a noble purpose.

01:19:52.985 --> 01:19:56.566
Her bloodline led you back to me..

01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:02.446
So fickle your Highness, falling in..
And out of love the way you do.

01:20:03.003 --> 01:20:05.244
For three millennia I waited

01:20:05.938 --> 01:20:11.689
Watching, guiding you through
all your incarnations

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:17.198
Nefrianna is alive within you.
Remember!

01:20:19.993 --> 01:20:21.424
Remember, your Highness

01:20:24.582 --> 01:20:25.782
No!
No!

01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:27.830
Noooo!!!

01:20:36.799 --> 01:20:40.996
Your heart shall beat safely within me, my
love.

01:20:41.318 --> 01:20:48.809
Until the day when I am
decreed worthy to return it.

01:20:52.186 --> 01:20:57.695
This is a choice moment you Highness
I envy thee ..

01:21:54.941 --> 01:21:58.164
I just sacrificed my life for thee..

01:22:18.147 --> 01:22:21.684
- It looks he bringing down a retractor
- A what?

01:22:21.703 --> 01:22:26.463
A retractor. They use it during
postmortems to separate the ribs.

01:22:26.506 --> 01:22:28.676
Her speciality..

01:22:30.731 --> 01:22:34.771
- And the body parts?
- Medical cadavers.

01:22:34.855 --> 01:22:40.679
She had the access. Only thing you have to
do now is to figure out the how and the why?

01:22:41.776 --> 01:22:45.194
In a case like this, there is no why.

01:22:45.824 --> 01:22:48.655
In the mind of our killer there was.
