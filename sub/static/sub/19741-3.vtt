WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:01.507
Previously on "The Catch"...

00:01.510 --> 00:03.835
The suspect's name is Kenji Yoshida.

00:03.838 --> 00:05.671
I got involved with some investors,

00:05.674 --> 00:07.457
powerful people who are using

00:07.460 --> 00:10.375
this restaurant as a front
for their other interests.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.600
The Bureau is giving you 24 hours

00:12.602 --> 00:14.903
to find out as much
as you can from Kenji.

00:14.905 --> 00:16.071
Chef asked me to give you this.

00:16.073 --> 00:18.495
We may need to come up
with a different strategy.

00:18.498 --> 00:20.265
I have a business proposition for you.

00:20.268 --> 00:23.111
- You want to hire us?
- To find out who's trying to kill me.

00:23.113 --> 00:24.379
He's here! Gansit Building to the north.

00:24.381 --> 00:26.414
I'm headed there now.

00:26.416 --> 00:28.183
We got him.

00:28.185 --> 00:29.284
He's called "The Hammer."

00:29.286 --> 00:30.285
So, what now?

00:30.287 --> 00:31.820
You torture me, kill me?

00:31.822 --> 00:33.088
I'm gonna hire you.

00:33.090 --> 00:34.471
- Guess who's coming to dinner.
- Hey.

00:34.473 --> 00:36.608
This little dinner-party can't happen.

00:36.611 --> 00:39.117
I don't know how long your brother's gonna
be in town. I would like to get to know him.

00:39.119 --> 00:41.429
And that was the first
time I killed a man.

00:41.431 --> 00:44.332
He's very impressionable,
and you and Rhys are not

00:44.335 --> 00:45.467
the best role models.

00:45.469 --> 00:46.634
Danny. What are you doing?

00:46.636 --> 00:48.203
You're supposed to be investigating

00:48.205 --> 00:49.404
the Kincaids, not Tommy.

00:49.406 --> 00:50.805
Is there anyone that you trust?

00:50.807 --> 00:53.641
Danny's a fool.

00:53.643 --> 00:55.543
What happened? Where were you?

00:55.545 --> 00:56.845
I was with Tommy.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.676
I found a keylogger hidden
on our security network

00:59.679 --> 01:02.246
that records every
keystroke, log-in, password...

01:02.249 --> 01:03.284
We've been hacked?

01:03.286 --> 01:05.587
I have access to $3 million.

01:05.589 --> 01:09.457
And I need someone in your line
of work to help me steal it.

01:12.662 --> 01:14.618
$3 million?

01:14.621 --> 01:16.965
In an offshore account in my name.

01:16.967 --> 01:19.734
Thomas, I underestimated you.

01:19.736 --> 01:21.669
I get that a lot.

01:21.671 --> 01:23.571
And you want me to help you...?

01:23.573 --> 01:24.572
Disappear.

01:24.574 --> 01:26.020
For a while.

01:26.023 --> 01:28.490
I'll need a new passport, new social.

01:28.493 --> 01:29.978
An entirely new you.

01:29.980 --> 01:31.379
Is that something that...

01:31.381 --> 01:33.448
someone in your line of work can do?

01:33.450 --> 01:35.617
For you? Of course. I
would be happy to help.

01:35.619 --> 01:37.318
I mean, you're practically family.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.753
Wow, thank you, Rhys.

01:38.755 --> 01:41.422
Which is why I'm only charging
you the friends-and-family rate.

01:41.424 --> 01:42.490
Of course.

01:44.060 --> 01:47.183
May I ask, for both our sakes,

01:47.186 --> 01:49.964
is Alice Vaughan going to
be all right with you...

01:49.966 --> 01:52.333
disappearing?

01:52.335 --> 01:54.369
We have to go to the authorities.

01:54.371 --> 01:55.870
- No!
- Your friends, the Kincaids...

01:55.872 --> 01:57.772
Oh, God, they were not my friends.

01:57.774 --> 02:00.108
They work for an organization
called the Southland Cartel.

02:00.111 --> 02:02.396
So the money in that
account with your name on it

02:02.398 --> 02:03.430
is drug money,

02:03.433 --> 02:04.946
which means it is only a matter of time

02:04.948 --> 02:06.954
before the cartel or
the feds show up here

02:06.957 --> 02:08.789
to either kill you or arrest you.

02:11.251 --> 02:13.388
I'm so sorry.

02:15.192 --> 02:16.524
Allie, I shouldn't... I should...

02:16.526 --> 02:17.759
I should never have come here.

02:17.761 --> 02:18.960
No, you did the right thing,

02:18.962 --> 02:20.628
but now the only thing
I can do to help you

02:20.630 --> 02:22.096
is get you under federal protection.

02:23.967 --> 02:25.900
So, who are you calling?

02:25.902 --> 02:28.770
I have a friend with
a contact at the FBI.

02:28.772 --> 02:30.905
I'm gonna see if he can help.

02:30.907 --> 02:33.908
Okay. Okay.

02:33.910 --> 02:36.144
Thanks.

02:42.591 --> 02:43.885
Come over.

02:43.887 --> 02:45.086
I wish I could.

02:45.088 --> 02:46.994
But you have a roommate now.

02:46.997 --> 02:48.931
So do you. Yes.

02:48.934 --> 02:51.041
My roommate and I need
to ask you a favor.

02:51.044 --> 02:52.760
It's always something with you people.

02:52.762 --> 02:54.195
How do you feel about Agent Diaz?

02:54.197 --> 02:55.863
Well, it's purely
platonic at this point,

02:55.865 --> 02:57.365
but I'll let you know where it goes.

02:58.602 --> 03:02.136
Is she smart,
trustworthy, a good person?

03:02.138 --> 03:04.038
Where are we going with this?

03:04.040 --> 03:05.707
Tommy may need to talk to someone.

03:05.709 --> 03:07.842
Well, now may not be the best time

03:07.844 --> 03:09.291
for me to be asking for favors.

03:09.294 --> 03:11.980
- What did you do?
- Why do you assume it was me?

03:11.982 --> 03:13.648
- Was it Rhys?
- No, it was me.

03:13.650 --> 03:14.782
Hmm.

03:14.784 --> 03:16.951
I lost the first target she assigned us.

03:16.953 --> 03:18.353
You lost him?

03:18.355 --> 03:20.488
He may or may not have
moved back to Japan

03:20.490 --> 03:21.689
because I suggested it.

03:21.691 --> 03:23.291
And what was your thinking there?

03:23.293 --> 03:25.424
Do you want me to ask Justine or not?

03:25.427 --> 03:27.761
Would you mind?

03:27.763 --> 03:29.529
We can meet her tonight.

03:29.531 --> 03:32.098
I'm worried if we wait longer...

03:37.038 --> 03:38.505
Allie, you there?

03:39.508 --> 03:41.808
He's gone.

03:41.810 --> 03:44.599
Tommy's gone.

03:46.031 --> 03:49.914
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

03:52.587 --> 03:53.853
Any word?

03:53.855 --> 03:55.220
He hasn't called or texted.

03:55.223 --> 03:57.109
Because his phone's been disconnected.

03:57.112 --> 04:00.032
I just checked the airline
manifests out of LAX and Burbank.

04:00.035 --> 04:02.328
If he's traveling, he's not
doing it under his own name.

04:02.330 --> 04:03.829
Has he touched the $3 million?

04:03.832 --> 04:06.199
No, I just checked, and
I changed the passwords.

04:06.201 --> 04:07.700
Will you check for me again?

04:07.702 --> 04:10.603
Sure, but he'd have to have
hacked our entire system.

04:10.605 --> 04:12.772
Or planted a keylogger.

04:15.277 --> 04:17.877
I'm just saying he had plenty of access.

04:17.879 --> 04:20.346
Where do you think he'll go?

04:20.348 --> 04:22.449
Depends on whether or
not he takes the money.

04:22.451 --> 04:24.050
- If he doesn't take it...
- He did.

04:24.052 --> 04:25.351
He took it.

04:25.353 --> 04:26.653
When?

04:29.198 --> 04:31.965
Three minutes ago. I just
changed the passwords.

04:31.968 --> 04:34.436
Then he did plant the keylogger.

04:34.439 --> 04:36.923
Maybe we can use it to track him.

04:36.926 --> 04:38.598
What's the point?

04:41.603 --> 04:43.636
He lied to us. He used us.

04:43.638 --> 04:44.637
Allie.

04:44.639 --> 04:45.738
What am I supposed to do?

04:45.740 --> 04:47.407
Continue to try to save him

04:47.409 --> 04:49.742
when he clearly doesn't
want to be saved?

04:49.744 --> 04:52.879
What's my job here?

04:57.619 --> 04:59.452
Fine, I'll keep looking.

04:59.454 --> 05:02.589
I'll go call his former employers.

05:03.797 --> 05:05.964
You guys go check in with Margot.

05:05.967 --> 05:07.862
I thought we weren't
working for Margot anymore.

05:07.864 --> 05:09.063
She says she has a new lead

05:09.065 --> 05:10.698
and another half million dollars for us.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.097
- I'll go.
- I can go.

05:12.100 --> 05:12.897
You'll both go.

05:12.899 --> 05:14.267
- No, that's okay.
- We can not do that.

05:14.269 --> 05:15.770
Is there a problem?

05:18.042 --> 05:20.108
Then go.

05:21.878 --> 05:23.511
Are we not gonna talk about this?

05:23.513 --> 05:25.546
What's there to talk about?
I warned you about Tommy.

05:25.548 --> 05:27.648
I don't want to talk about Tommy.

05:27.650 --> 05:29.016
I want to talk about you and me.

05:31.855 --> 05:33.458
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God.

05:33.461 --> 05:34.627
At ease, children.

05:34.630 --> 05:36.698
- What is he doing here?
- I hired him.

05:36.701 --> 05:37.393
You what?

05:37.396 --> 05:38.728
He's a paid assassin.

05:38.731 --> 05:40.064
Yes, and now I pay him.

05:40.066 --> 05:41.799
The question is what
are you two doing here?

05:42.802 --> 05:44.602
We have an appointment.

05:44.604 --> 05:46.698
No, I had an appointment
with Alice Vaughan.

05:46.701 --> 05:48.439
Alice has a family issue.

05:48.441 --> 05:50.374
So I get the B-team now, is that it?

05:50.376 --> 05:52.995
For your information, I've been
doing this longer than Alice has.

05:52.998 --> 05:54.879
Come in, B-team.

06:02.488 --> 06:05.589
Val said you had a lead?

06:05.591 --> 06:07.222
I have The Hammer,

06:07.225 --> 06:09.654
and you will have his full cooperation.

06:09.657 --> 06:12.396
You want us to work with
the man who tried to kill us?

06:12.399 --> 06:14.787
No hard feelings. It wasn't personal.

06:14.790 --> 06:16.634
I thought you said you
didn't know who hired you.

06:16.636 --> 06:17.701
I don't.

06:17.703 --> 06:19.136
But he knows how he was hired,

06:19.138 --> 06:21.038
and hopefully, the two of you
are good enough at your job

06:21.040 --> 06:23.217
that you can do something
useful with that information.

06:23.220 --> 06:26.110
Do you know anything
about blockchain databases?

06:26.112 --> 06:27.778
The Ethereum Network?

06:29.080 --> 06:30.446
No, but...

06:30.448 --> 06:31.580
It facilitates payments

06:31.582 --> 06:33.683
through computer-generated
cryptocurrency.

06:33.685 --> 06:34.650
Exactly.

06:34.652 --> 06:37.353
So my ID and the client's stay private.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.390
I get paid half up front,
half upon proof of death.

06:41.392 --> 06:43.893
And what constitutes proof of death?

06:43.895 --> 06:46.829
A head, an ear, a finger.

06:46.831 --> 06:48.264
Oh, a head.

06:48.266 --> 06:49.665
I charge extra for the head.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.632
It's a lot more work, plus shipping.

06:53.236 --> 06:56.771
Any of this useful to you at all,
B-team, or should I call Alice and Val?

06:56.773 --> 06:59.407
Ethereum transactions don't
create a public footprint,

06:59.409 --> 07:01.709
but I might be able
to trace the payment.

07:01.711 --> 07:04.512
Someone just graduated to the A-team.

07:05.815 --> 07:07.582
Better step it up, eye candy.

07:13.925 --> 07:15.157
- Kenji's gone.
- I know.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.924
- Before you get too mad...
- He's not in LA.

07:16.926 --> 07:20.127
- He's not in Osaka.
- It's okay. Kenji is not our guy.

07:20.129 --> 07:21.069
There's a bigger bad out there.

07:21.071 --> 07:22.430
You keep saying that,
but there's no proof.

07:22.432 --> 07:24.611
Yes, there is, thanks to you
and your surveillance cameras.

07:24.613 --> 07:27.368
- Well, I planted those cameras.
- We have proof.

07:27.370 --> 07:30.671
Thanks to me and my rather
Welles-ian camera placement,

07:30.673 --> 07:32.306
we now have our big bad on film.

07:32.308 --> 07:34.876
The thing is...

07:34.878 --> 07:36.897
she's not that big.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.233
She walks into the freezer,

07:38.236 --> 07:40.515
knows exactly where the diamonds are,

07:40.517 --> 07:42.817
grabs them, heads out
the back door to her car.

07:48.826 --> 07:49.959
Oh, no.

07:49.961 --> 07:51.260
- What is it?
- What's the matter?

07:51.262 --> 07:53.259
It's a diplomatic pouch.

07:53.262 --> 07:55.418
That's an ugly word,
isn't it... "pouch"?

07:55.421 --> 07:57.622
It's the "diplomatic" part that's ugly.

07:57.625 --> 07:59.468
Our big bad is a diplomat.

07:59.470 --> 08:01.270
Oh, which means you can't go after her.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.838
Not without creating an
international incident.

08:02.840 --> 08:06.175
Our big bad really is a big bad.

08:06.177 --> 08:07.610
But who is she?

08:07.612 --> 08:10.146
I'm almost afraid to run
the plates and find out.

08:10.148 --> 08:11.680
We're wasting our time.

08:11.682 --> 08:12.982
Tommy could be anywhere.

08:12.984 --> 08:14.835
We could get the police involved.

08:15.908 --> 08:18.342
He does have an army of
drug dealers after him.

08:18.345 --> 08:20.245
Who would we call? Renée?

08:21.125 --> 08:22.892
I could call Nick.

08:22.894 --> 08:25.161
He could put out a BOLO.

08:25.163 --> 08:27.663
He's not gonna do me any
favors. He'd be doing it for me.

08:28.699 --> 08:30.317
We don't need Nick.

08:32.003 --> 08:34.003
I'll find Tommy.

08:34.005 --> 08:35.528
Guys?

08:35.530 --> 08:37.006
We have a walk-in.

08:42.246 --> 08:44.413
So, how can we help you, Mr...?

08:44.415 --> 08:45.648
Tasker.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.716
I'm looking for someone.

08:47.718 --> 08:48.851
A thief.

08:48.853 --> 08:52.321
Someone who stole from
me and my associates.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.690
His name is Tommy Vaughan.

08:56.671 --> 09:00.262
What a coincidence. We're
looking for him, too.

09:01.766 --> 09:04.533
So we can't help you.

09:05.570 --> 09:07.436
Well...

09:07.438 --> 09:09.405
If I don't find him,

09:09.407 --> 09:13.776
at least I know where I can find you...

09:13.778 --> 09:14.944
and your friends.

09:16.447 --> 09:19.548
See you soon.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:30.929 --> 09:32.544
His name is Theo Tasker.

09:32.546 --> 09:34.312
12 arrests, no convictions.

09:34.314 --> 09:35.928
According to federal prosecutors,

09:35.931 --> 09:38.216
he's a high-ranking lieutenant
in the Southland Drug Cartel.

09:38.218 --> 09:41.237
- These are bad people who kill people.
- People like the Kincaids.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.988
People like us, if we
don't give them Tommy.

09:43.990 --> 09:45.339
We're not giving them Tommy.

09:45.342 --> 09:48.026
So do we keep digging into
Tasker, into the cartel?

09:48.028 --> 09:49.561
We can't take on the cartel.

09:49.563 --> 09:52.030
We don't have the manpower,
resources, experience.

09:52.032 --> 09:53.464
I know someone who does.

09:53.466 --> 09:54.766
We're not calling Nick.

09:54.768 --> 09:58.069
We have drug dealers threatening
to kill us now, Allie.

09:58.071 --> 09:59.932
I'm calling Nick.

09:59.935 --> 10:01.134
Val.

10:02.576 --> 10:04.509
Who's Nick?

10:18.378 --> 10:21.609
We're here with LA's Chief of
Detectives, Nicholas Turner,

10:21.612 --> 10:24.162
the man many believe will
be our next chief of police.

10:24.164 --> 10:26.731
Deputy Chief Turner,
the number of shootings

10:26.733 --> 10:28.967
and killings is down in LA this year.

10:28.969 --> 10:30.234
Why do you think that is?

10:30.237 --> 10:32.543
Well, Tammi, I'd say it's because

10:32.546 --> 10:35.540
relationship-based policing works.

10:35.542 --> 10:38.038
We're getting cops out
of cars and riot gear

10:38.041 --> 10:40.038
so they can be a part of the community.

10:40.041 --> 10:42.313
It's about building trust.

10:44.205 --> 10:48.353
And in some cases, rebuilding trust.

10:48.355 --> 10:50.054
And we're out.

10:54.879 --> 10:56.630
What do you need, Val?

10:56.633 --> 10:58.148
For your information,

10:58.151 --> 11:00.555
I'm here to offer you something.

11:00.558 --> 11:02.033
Southland Drug Cartel.

11:03.281 --> 11:06.170
Now, that would almost guarantee
your police chief appointment.

11:06.172 --> 11:08.806
What have you got?

11:08.808 --> 11:11.029
You remember Alice
Vaughan's brother, Tommy?

11:11.032 --> 11:12.944
Alice Vaughan's brother's
in with the cartel?

11:12.946 --> 11:14.412
Why am I not surprised?

11:14.414 --> 11:17.115
- You need to stop.
- Well, Alice Vaughan stole my partner.

11:17.117 --> 11:19.751
She didn't have to steal me. I left.

11:19.753 --> 11:21.252
And we both know why.

11:21.254 --> 11:24.956
Tommy Vaughan is missing,
and the cartel is after him.

11:24.958 --> 11:26.124
And why is that?

11:26.126 --> 11:27.692
You're working the
Kincaids' murders, right?

11:27.694 --> 11:29.394
- Mm-hmm.
- Tommy was their dog walker.

11:29.396 --> 11:30.795
Well, how do we know
he didn't kill them?

11:30.797 --> 11:32.363
Because it's Tommy Vaughan.

11:32.364 --> 11:33.297
Exactly.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.125
Do you want to work
together on this or not?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.738
Oh, now we're working together?

11:36.741 --> 11:40.038
You find Tommy for me, and
I will get you the cartel.

11:41.374 --> 11:43.908
It'll be just like old times.

11:43.910 --> 11:46.244
I'll see what I can do.

11:46.246 --> 11:47.478
You do that.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.833
Chief.

12:12.537 --> 12:15.688
Yeah, I got a, uh, delivery
for an Alice Vaughan.

12:17.482 --> 12:19.018
You're not supposed to be here.

12:19.021 --> 12:20.221
I'm in disguise.

12:20.224 --> 12:21.890
Delivery guy.

12:21.893 --> 12:23.881
I like it.

12:30.990 --> 12:32.657
We got to figure out

12:32.659 --> 12:33.958
how we're gonna spend
time with each other.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.961
If by "spend time with each other,"
you mean sex, then we really do.

12:36.963 --> 12:39.030
I don't have my roommate anymore.

12:39.032 --> 12:40.798
You guys still haven't found him?

12:40.800 --> 12:41.799
Mnh-mnh.

12:42.869 --> 12:44.836
What do you know about
the Southland Cartel?

12:44.838 --> 12:47.138
- What does the cartel want with Tommy?
- $3 million.

12:47.140 --> 12:49.574
- He borrowed money from them?
- Well, that's one way of looking at it.

12:49.576 --> 12:51.909
- And you don't know where he is.
- Mnh-mnh.

12:51.911 --> 12:53.978
So now's probably not the best time

12:53.980 --> 12:56.417
to be asking you for a favor.

12:56.420 --> 12:58.383
I thought you just came here for sex.

12:58.385 --> 12:58.937
I did.

12:58.940 --> 13:01.152
I promise that's the
only reason I'm here.

13:01.154 --> 13:03.254
I just figured so long as I am here,

13:03.256 --> 13:05.523
could you run a diplomatic plate for me?

13:05.525 --> 13:07.225
Don't you work for the FBI?

13:07.227 --> 13:08.659
This seems like something

13:08.661 --> 13:10.795
that Agent Diaz should
be able to handle.

13:10.797 --> 13:14.198
Yeah, but I like the way you do it.

13:15.502 --> 13:16.968
What is this?

13:17.971 --> 13:20.238
I thought you said you
weren't looking for Margot.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.207
We are not looking for her because...

13:23.209 --> 13:24.618
Good, because you're better off

13:24.621 --> 13:26.274
going after the Southland Cartel.

13:26.277 --> 13:27.876
All they want is their money.

13:27.879 --> 13:30.384
And so long as Tommy gives
them every last dollar back,

13:30.387 --> 13:31.484
he'll be fine.

13:31.487 --> 13:32.820
No, no, they're beautiful.

13:32.822 --> 13:35.222
It's just... I just
don't know what they say.

13:35.224 --> 13:37.258
What would you like them to say?

13:37.260 --> 13:39.727
Uh, "Thank you. I'm sorry.

13:39.729 --> 13:41.362
Don't hate me."

13:41.364 --> 13:44.565
We have necklaces, brooches, hair clips?

13:44.567 --> 13:46.261
- Sure. Um...
- Okay.

13:47.803 --> 13:49.570
Hello?

13:49.572 --> 13:51.505
Is this Albert Ollerman?

13:51.507 --> 13:53.741
No, um, yeah, you have the wrong number.

13:53.743 --> 13:56.952
It's Rhys, and from now
on, you are Albert Ollerman.

13:56.955 --> 13:58.107
Sorry about the name.

13:58.110 --> 13:59.312
Uh, your paperwork is here.

13:59.315 --> 14:00.414
Where are you?

14:00.416 --> 14:02.183
I am buying an apology gift.

14:02.185 --> 14:03.284
Oh, I wouldn't.

14:03.286 --> 14:04.177
In my experience,

14:04.180 --> 14:06.921
that kind of gift only works
one out of every eight times.

14:06.923 --> 14:09.557
- Those are the hair clips.
- You're not buying a hair clip.

14:09.559 --> 14:10.758
It's just that earrings...

14:10.760 --> 14:12.693
They just seem a little... I don't know.

14:12.695 --> 14:14.695
Is there a professional there with you?

14:14.697 --> 14:16.630
- Yes.
- Put them on the phone, please.

14:16.632 --> 14:18.632
He would like to talk to you.

14:18.634 --> 14:19.833
Oh.

14:19.835 --> 14:21.468
Hello, this is Vikki.

14:21.470 --> 14:22.736
Vikki, darling, do me a favor.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.438
Put the hair clips back
where you found them

14:24.440 --> 14:25.739
and tell me about the earrings.

14:25.741 --> 14:27.474
They are diamond studs,

14:27.476 --> 14:30.344
1 1/2 carats each in
a white-gold setting.

14:30.346 --> 14:31.478
How much?

14:31.480 --> 14:33.180
- $12,000.
- He'll give you $10,000 cash.

14:33.182 --> 14:34.448
Go and talk to your manager

14:34.450 --> 14:36.383
and put my friend back
on the phone, will you?

14:36.385 --> 14:38.352
- Thank you, dear.
- Thank you!

14:38.354 --> 14:40.054
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

14:41.488 --> 14:42.812
What just happened?

14:42.815 --> 14:44.592
Well, if you insist
on spending that money

14:44.594 --> 14:45.659
before you leave the country,

14:45.661 --> 14:48.495
which I strongly suggest you do not,

14:48.497 --> 14:50.364
I just saved you $2,000.

14:50.366 --> 14:52.166
Yeah, but I have to do something.

14:52.168 --> 14:54.735
I wouldn't even have the
money if it wasn't for her.

14:54.737 --> 14:56.670
Guys, this was just delivered.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.607
It's for Sophie.

14:59.609 --> 15:01.175
Me?

15:01.177 --> 15:02.943
- Sophie!
- Wow.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.178
Open it.

15:09.785 --> 15:11.318
Whoa.

15:12.321 --> 15:14.421
- Whoa.
- Wow!

15:14.423 --> 15:16.590
Who are those from?

15:19.228 --> 15:21.762
Are they from Tommy?

15:30.071 --> 15:32.672
We had dinner.

15:32.675 --> 15:35.276
They're going back to the store.

15:35.278 --> 15:37.278
He can't be spending that money.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.046
I'm so sorry, Alice.

15:39.048 --> 15:41.669
You don't have anything to be sorry for.

15:42.953 --> 15:44.953
You just gave us our first lead.

15:47.156 --> 15:49.790
So our mysterious diamond smuggler...

15:49.792 --> 15:51.091
Do we know who she is yet?

15:51.093 --> 15:53.544
No, but thanks to Alice,
we know who she works for.

15:54.363 --> 15:56.730
Kohana Takashi.

15:56.732 --> 15:58.866
Japanese Consul General
here to promote trade

15:58.868 --> 16:00.234
between Japan and the US.

16:00.236 --> 16:03.017
And apparently to smuggle
diamonds from Japan to the US.

16:03.020 --> 16:04.687
Using her diplomatic status as cover.

16:04.690 --> 16:06.674
Brains and beauty. Is she single?

16:06.676 --> 16:09.176
A widow. One son... Jesse.

16:09.178 --> 16:11.145
So I swan into her life

16:11.147 --> 16:14.615
posing as a charming British single dad.

16:14.617 --> 16:16.450
Perhaps I have a slight, uh, uh, stutter

16:16.452 --> 16:18.452
she can help me overcome. We meet cute.

16:18.454 --> 16:19.753
We make love.

16:19.755 --> 16:21.488
Or, since Kenji's restaurant is closed,

16:21.490 --> 16:23.324
she'll need a new
front for her operation.

16:23.326 --> 16:25.059
So I'm a sexy single restaurateur

16:25.061 --> 16:26.493
with a taste for cocaine and diamonds.

16:26.495 --> 16:28.762
And the two of us
convince the consul general

16:28.764 --> 16:30.336
to use our restaurant.

16:30.339 --> 16:31.539
Fine, whatever.

16:32.702 --> 16:35.102
- Do we have a restaurant?
- We will.

16:35.104 --> 16:37.237
And then when her next
shipment of diamonds comes in...

16:37.239 --> 16:39.634
We hand her over to the FBI.

16:39.637 --> 16:42.374
Except the FBI's not going
anywhere near Kohana Takashi.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.037
The boss said no.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.245
The bureau can't get
caught investigating

16:45.247 --> 16:46.545
a Japanese dignitary.

16:46.548 --> 16:47.867
Well, it's a good thing that Rhys and I

16:47.869 --> 16:49.449
aren't actually FBI agents.

16:49.452 --> 16:51.051
What are you suggesting?

16:51.053 --> 16:53.120
We go into business with her.

16:53.122 --> 16:55.356
And then we leak enough evidence
to the press to force an arrest.

16:55.358 --> 16:57.024
You get to tell your
boss, "I told you so."

16:57.026 --> 16:58.225
We get out of the dog house,

16:58.227 --> 16:59.927
and Kohana Takashi gets
a swift extradition.

16:59.929 --> 17:02.129
- Everybody wins.
- All you have to do is trust us.

17:02.131 --> 17:04.531
The last time I did that,
you lost my only suspect.

17:04.532 --> 17:06.467
Yeah, well, to be fair,
you didn't trust us then.

17:06.469 --> 17:07.701
Well, I don't trust you now.

17:07.703 --> 17:10.537
You'd be operating without
the approval of the FBI,

17:10.539 --> 17:15.027
going rogue without a safety
net or any bureau oversight.

17:15.030 --> 17:17.631
So as your handler, I
absolutely can't allow this.

17:18.714 --> 17:21.982
Which is why it just might work.

17:31.022 --> 17:33.155
I'm sorry you didn't like them.

17:33.158 --> 17:35.159
He had such a terrible
time trying to decide.

17:35.161 --> 17:36.594
He even had to call a friend.

17:36.596 --> 17:37.862
A friend?

17:37.864 --> 17:40.098
Such a nice man.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.826
He put me on the phone with him.

17:41.829 --> 17:43.334
But I have always been a sucker

17:43.336 --> 17:44.769
for a man with a British accent.

17:44.771 --> 17:46.325
His friend was British?

17:46.328 --> 17:47.493
Mm-hmm.

17:54.838 --> 17:56.871
Do you need to take that?

17:56.873 --> 18:00.675
That is not a conversation
I need to have right now...

18:00.677 --> 18:03.812
Not with my friend Albert
Ollerman in the house.

18:03.815 --> 18:06.278
- Driver's license...
- Okay.

18:06.281 --> 18:10.070
...passport, hand-aged
birth certificate,

18:10.073 --> 18:14.429
work visa, and a first-class
ticket to Slovenia.

18:15.516 --> 18:19.618
The skiing in Kranjska
Gora is supposed to be...

18:19.620 --> 18:20.919
not terrible.

18:24.725 --> 18:27.793
You don't have to do this, you know.

18:27.795 --> 18:29.828
I mean, you still have to pay me,

18:29.830 --> 18:32.331
but you don't have to
go through with this.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.299
I'm sure your sister could
find at least a dozen ways

18:34.301 --> 18:35.501
to get you out of it.

18:37.938 --> 18:40.639
I can't keep asking
her to do that for me.

18:40.641 --> 18:43.542
Yeah, I have a sister like that myself.

18:43.544 --> 18:45.677
Here you go.

18:45.679 --> 18:46.845
Ah.

18:46.847 --> 18:48.046
Thank you.

18:50.951 --> 18:52.050
Chin up, Bertie.

18:52.052 --> 18:53.819
I'm sure Alice will
forgive you eventually.

18:53.821 --> 18:54.887
Maybe she already has.

18:54.889 --> 18:57.789
I'm sure the earrings helped.

18:59.093 --> 19:00.792
Yeah, those earrings weren't for Alice.

19:00.794 --> 19:02.995
I wasn't aware that your
date with Tommy was a secret.

19:02.997 --> 19:04.563
- You slut-shamed me...
- No, I did not!

19:04.565 --> 19:05.797
...in front of my bosses.

19:05.799 --> 19:07.065
That's absolutely not true,

19:07.067 --> 19:09.268
and if you think that I owe
you some kind of apology,

19:09.270 --> 19:10.536
let me tell you something.

19:10.538 --> 19:11.937
Oh, look, it's Sophie,

19:11.939 --> 19:14.373
and she brought the B-team with her.

19:14.376 --> 19:16.594
Come in, you two.

19:19.847 --> 19:22.848
I reverse-hacked the initial
payment to The Hammer's account,

19:22.850 --> 19:24.764
and it was made in
person at a bank downtown.

19:24.767 --> 19:26.207
Ah, and does this bank have a handy

19:26.210 --> 19:27.871
little network of
cameras we can hack into?

19:27.873 --> 19:29.855
Yes, but it's a closed-network system,

19:29.857 --> 19:31.590
so it's not accessible online.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.993
So we'll need to break in there
and access the footage ourselves.

19:34.995 --> 19:36.962
Except we don't know if the
footage is stored on site,

19:36.964 --> 19:37.930
so it...

19:37.932 --> 19:39.631
So instead...

19:40.434 --> 19:42.334
- Sorry, go ahead.
- No, it's fine.

19:42.336 --> 19:43.724
- Sophie.
- Oh, for God's sakes, before

19:43.726 --> 19:45.070
I have the Hammer kill you both.

19:45.072 --> 19:47.690
We'll have better luck
if we hack into the feed

19:47.693 --> 19:49.192
so we can watch it anywhere.

19:49.195 --> 19:50.108
Watch what?

19:50.110 --> 19:52.010
The Hammer said his
second payment is due

19:52.012 --> 19:53.828
when he submits proof of death.

19:54.583 --> 19:56.850
So you're going to have
him cut off my finger?

19:56.853 --> 19:58.617
It doesn't need to be your finger.

19:58.619 --> 20:00.118
There's no shortage
of fingers out there.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.353
Most people have 10.

20:01.355 --> 20:04.223
You can't just cut off the
finger of an innocent woman.

20:04.225 --> 20:06.258
Is anyone really innocent?

20:06.260 --> 20:08.060
He does have a point.

20:08.062 --> 20:10.862
Even if he does obtain a
finger from another person,

20:10.864 --> 20:12.397
it wouldn't match your fingerprint.

20:12.399 --> 20:14.166
Oh, darling, I haven't
had fingerprints for years.

20:14.168 --> 20:16.668
So we send off the finger.

20:16.670 --> 20:18.036
Then the killer comes back to the bank

20:18.038 --> 20:19.171
to make the second payment.

20:19.173 --> 20:20.239
But this time, we're watching.

20:20.241 --> 20:21.573
It should only take a couple of days.

20:21.575 --> 20:22.641
A couple of days?

20:22.644 --> 20:24.910
No, no, no, no. I've been locked
in this prison long enough.

20:24.912 --> 20:25.877
Really?

20:25.879 --> 20:27.879
Prison?

20:27.881 --> 20:30.389
I'll get us tapped
into that feed tomorrow.

20:30.392 --> 20:31.683
You meet me there at 9:00 a.m.

20:31.685 --> 20:33.479
No. We're not gonna let you.
That's not... That's not...

20:33.481 --> 20:34.513
- Sorry.
- No.

20:34.516 --> 20:36.154
Go ahead.

20:36.156 --> 20:38.023
Someone's still trying to kill you.

20:38.025 --> 20:40.125
Yes, and they hired The Hammer to do it,

20:40.127 --> 20:42.461
so as long as he stays
on my payroll, I'm safe,

20:42.463 --> 20:44.563
unless, of course, I need to worry about

20:44.565 --> 20:46.698
whatever is going on
with the two of you.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.200
What is going on with you two?

20:48.202 --> 20:50.502
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

20:57.765 --> 20:59.478
I have to say,

20:59.480 --> 21:02.648
my friend Valerie has
done very well for herself.

21:03.684 --> 21:04.783
You think?

21:04.785 --> 21:07.286
Apart from that pesky FBI investigation.

21:07.288 --> 21:08.887
Ah.

21:08.889 --> 21:10.278
You know about that?

21:10.281 --> 21:12.456
I check up on you occasionally.

21:12.459 --> 21:15.359
Then you also know
that we've been cleared.

21:15.362 --> 21:19.164
Alice Vaughan just can't
seem to stay out of trouble,

21:19.166 --> 21:21.900
- now, can she?
- That was a long time ago.

21:21.902 --> 21:23.642
She's one of the good guys now.

21:23.645 --> 21:25.971
If that's true, it's thanks to you.

21:28.609 --> 21:30.575
What's this?

21:30.577 --> 21:33.111
It's where we are on
the Southland Cartel.

21:33.113 --> 21:36.782
No sign of Tommy yet,
but we'll find him.

21:40.688 --> 21:42.421
If she suspects anything, it's over.

21:42.423 --> 21:44.089
Kohana Takashi is a powerful woman,

21:44.091 --> 21:45.557
impossible to get to.

21:45.559 --> 21:48.226
So the direct approach is out.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.408
Ah.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.665
We're working.

21:53.667 --> 21:56.335
Fortunately, there's
one thing she cares about

21:56.337 --> 21:58.470
more than work... Her son, Jesse.

21:58.472 --> 22:00.772
And there's only one
thing Jesse cares about...

22:00.774 --> 22:03.241
Status.

22:03.243 --> 22:04.976
If there's a hot new club or restaurant,

22:04.978 --> 22:06.545
Jesse's always first on the scene.

22:06.547 --> 22:09.948
Same goes for fashion trends,
all the latest high-tech toys.

22:09.950 --> 22:12.351
He's obsessed with anything
new, limited, or exclusive.

22:12.353 --> 22:14.186
- So we'll bait him.
- With a dinner party.

22:14.188 --> 22:16.621
- A dinner party?
- Well, not just any dinner party.

22:16.623 --> 22:18.404
The most exclusive dinner
party in Los Angeles...

22:18.406 --> 22:19.705
One night only.

22:19.708 --> 22:21.942
- And you'll invite him.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:21.945 --> 22:24.318
We'll invite his friends instead.

22:24.321 --> 22:27.099
They'll all receive a personal
summons to the Dining Hall,

22:27.101 --> 22:29.034
an underground dining experience

22:29.036 --> 22:31.370
promising a who's who
of artists, celebs,

22:31.372 --> 22:32.371
and tastemakers.

22:32.373 --> 22:34.326
We'll invite everyone but Jesse,

22:34.329 --> 22:37.008
which should lead him right to us.

22:38.545 --> 22:41.713
Eyes on Jesse turning
left, headed your way.

22:41.715 --> 22:42.914
Copy that.

22:42.916 --> 22:44.616
I've got it from here.

22:45.853 --> 22:47.319
Wow.

22:47.321 --> 22:50.489
That was fast.

22:53.927 --> 22:55.794
Yes?

22:55.796 --> 22:58.163
Where the hell's my brother?

22:59.299 --> 23:00.565
Where's Tommy?

23:00.568 --> 23:02.849
This is not actually an ideal time.

23:02.852 --> 23:04.798
Is he here? Tommy?!

23:04.801 --> 23:06.453
- Tommy?!
- He's not here.

23:06.456 --> 23:08.789
- He's not here! I promise you!
- Rhys, is that Alice?

23:08.791 --> 23:09.991
- What is Alice doing there?
- I don't...

23:09.993 --> 23:11.325
The mark will be there any second.

23:11.327 --> 23:12.893
You're either hiding him or helping him.

23:12.895 --> 23:15.763
- Which is it?
- I'm actually working right now.

23:15.765 --> 23:17.231
Ben and I have a mark on approach.

23:17.233 --> 23:20.001
Rhys, get Alice out of there
and just... I... I mean,

23:20.003 --> 23:22.536
- ask her to please not be there.
- Ben would like you to leave.

23:22.538 --> 23:24.338
- Oh, would he?
- I said ask, not tell.

23:24.340 --> 23:26.508
You tell Ben that I will leave

23:26.511 --> 23:29.277
when you tell me where my brother is!

23:29.279 --> 23:32.013
Rhys, do you know where Tommy is?

23:32.015 --> 23:34.882
- Kind of.
- Then tell her.

23:34.884 --> 23:36.384
All right.

23:36.386 --> 23:38.252
But don't be upset.

23:38.254 --> 23:39.420
- Too late!
- Too late.

23:39.422 --> 23:41.322
Fine.

23:42.425 --> 23:45.760
He's traveling under the
name of Albert Ollerman.

23:45.762 --> 23:47.862
Now you really have to go.

23:47.864 --> 23:51.232
Okay, uh, just one moment.

23:51.234 --> 23:52.366
Alice, pl...

23:54.137 --> 23:55.736
Yes? What is it?

23:55.738 --> 23:57.571
Hey, uh, is this the Dining Hall?

23:58.574 --> 24:00.641
Depends entirely upon who's asking.

24:00.643 --> 24:02.243
The Consul General of Japan?

24:02.245 --> 24:04.398
She's in charge of
US-Japanese relations,

24:04.401 --> 24:05.346
foreign trade.

24:05.348 --> 24:07.448
Yeah, I know what a consul
general does, thank you very much.

24:07.450 --> 24:08.816
Oh, then you know she's
super well-connected.

24:08.818 --> 24:09.784
She has total access.

24:09.786 --> 24:11.185
She knows everyone.

24:11.187 --> 24:12.653
Including you, apparently.

24:12.655 --> 24:14.989
Yeah, um, she's kind of my mom.

24:14.991 --> 24:17.491
So... can we come?

24:20.555 --> 24:23.857
If your mother really
is the consul general,

24:23.860 --> 24:26.299
tell her dinner's at 8:00.

24:26.302 --> 24:28.402
All right. Cool. Awesome.

24:31.874 --> 24:33.441
You and Tommy.

24:33.443 --> 24:35.609
Start talking.

24:40.616 --> 24:42.683
Let's go over it again, B-team.

24:42.685 --> 24:44.118
You know I do this for a living, right?

24:44.120 --> 24:46.018
I will be disguised as Lydia Pemberton.

24:46.021 --> 24:48.422
This whole surveillance setup...
I did this. I put this together.

24:48.424 --> 24:50.257
And I'm in need of a safety deposit box

24:50.259 --> 24:52.693
in which to store my late
husband's family heirlooms.

24:52.695 --> 24:53.694
And you are...?

24:53.696 --> 24:55.129
Disguised as your bodyman.

24:55.131 --> 24:56.397
No, not just disguised as my bodyman,

24:56.399 --> 24:57.965
because The Hammer will
be in here with Sophie.

24:57.967 --> 24:59.533
So you will effectively be my bodyman

24:59.535 --> 25:00.968
in case somebody tries to kill me.

25:00.970 --> 25:02.603
I can't think why anyone
would want to do that.

25:02.605 --> 25:04.238
The bank manager will
escort me into his office,

25:04.240 --> 25:05.473
leaving you free...

25:05.475 --> 25:06.941
To tap into the CCTV footage,

25:06.943 --> 25:08.809
which will appear on
these monitors here,

25:08.811 --> 25:10.244
which I set up all by myself

25:10.246 --> 25:12.813
'cause this is what I do for a living.

25:12.815 --> 25:15.049
Is she like this with you?

25:15.051 --> 25:17.100
- No.
- Come along, B-team!

25:17.103 --> 25:18.547
Great.

25:24.844 --> 25:27.912
I, uh, got this for you.

25:34.103 --> 25:36.504
Oh, it's perfect.

25:36.506 --> 25:40.007
Well, I didn't want you maiming
some poor innocent woman,

25:40.009 --> 25:42.425
so I got in touch with
a friend at the morgue.

25:42.428 --> 25:45.679
But... I didn't get you anything.

25:45.681 --> 25:47.581
That's okay.

25:56.359 --> 25:58.225
Stand up straight.

25:58.227 --> 26:00.161
Try not to look so much

26:00.163 --> 26:02.096
like you're waiting for
Mommy to buy you an ice cream.

26:02.098 --> 26:03.631
There's your game face.

26:03.633 --> 26:07.168
Now just keep hating me while
I go and find the manager.

26:18.514 --> 26:20.915
Sir, get on the ground!

26:20.917 --> 26:22.616
On the ground!

26:22.618 --> 26:24.752
Give me your hands! Put
your hands behind your back!

26:24.754 --> 26:26.587
Don't move.

26:26.589 --> 26:29.597
Get these people out of here.

26:29.600 --> 26:33.127
What the hell was that?

26:33.129 --> 26:34.762
You should have seen your face.

26:34.764 --> 26:36.196
Well, thanks to me, he can.

26:36.199 --> 26:37.716
You hacked the system.

26:37.719 --> 26:38.899
I couldn't count on you to do it.

26:38.901 --> 26:40.470
Those guards could have killed me.

26:40.473 --> 26:41.975
The only reason they
let me go is because...

26:41.977 --> 26:43.443
You did a great job, B-team.

26:43.446 --> 26:45.873
Now all we have to do is have
The Hammer send proof of death

26:45.875 --> 26:49.376
and wait for our mystery
guest to appear on camera.

26:51.581 --> 26:52.613
Where are you guys going?

26:52.615 --> 26:53.881
Lunch.

26:53.883 --> 26:55.883
I thought you'd like to stay
with the surveillance setup,

26:55.885 --> 26:57.818
since it is what you do for a living.

26:58.818 --> 27:01.016
Anything happens to Tommy Vaughan...

27:01.019 --> 27:01.822
It won't.

27:01.824 --> 27:03.711
You should be thanking
me. I saved his life.

27:03.714 --> 27:05.593
How much you charging him?

27:05.596 --> 27:08.297
I... Friends-and-family rate.

27:09.065 --> 27:10.731
- What are you doing here?
- Whoa, look at you.

27:10.733 --> 27:12.500
We're going rogue, remember?

27:12.502 --> 27:14.702
I'm hosting this little dinner party.

27:14.704 --> 27:16.470
Well, that is quite an
outfit you've got on there.

27:16.472 --> 27:17.838
Yeah, and quite a necklace.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.807
You borrow that from
the evidence locker?

27:19.809 --> 27:21.758
Why would you assume that?

27:21.761 --> 27:24.144
- Because I know how much you make.
- And I know how much that costs.

27:24.146 --> 27:26.280
Maybe my husband gave it to me.

27:26.282 --> 27:29.517
- Whoa, you have a husband?
- What?

27:29.519 --> 27:32.353
Does he know about us?

27:35.625 --> 27:37.825
Tommy used to be
terrible at hide-and-seek.

27:37.827 --> 27:39.827
That's not the only game he's playing.

27:39.829 --> 27:40.592
Oh, no.

27:40.595 --> 27:42.296
Nick's research on the cartel

27:42.298 --> 27:44.532
shows their main distribution centers

27:44.534 --> 27:47.535
are in Torrance, Pasadena,
Atwater, and Studio City.

27:47.537 --> 27:50.065
All of Tommy's former employers...

27:50.068 --> 27:52.840
Live in Torrance, Pasadena,
Atwater, and Studio City.

27:54.143 --> 27:57.211
Tommy is working for the cartel.

27:57.213 --> 27:59.301
I found him.

27:59.304 --> 28:02.405
Albert Ollerman is on
a flight to Slovenia

28:02.408 --> 28:03.875
that leaves LAX in two hours.

28:03.878 --> 28:05.386
Do you want me to come with you?

28:05.388 --> 28:07.721
Probably best if there's no
witnesses when I find him.

28:16.399 --> 28:19.266
Here, Tommy, let me help you with that.

28:28.815 --> 28:31.115
Theo! Ahh.

28:31.118 --> 28:32.922
Thank God!

28:32.924 --> 28:36.325
Ohh, I found out

28:36.327 --> 28:39.829
that the Kincaids were
skimming money off the top.

28:39.831 --> 28:42.998
And I managed to get
the money back for you.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.501
But, you know, they're...
they're both dead.

28:45.503 --> 28:47.203
I know they're dead, Tommy.

28:47.205 --> 28:48.189
- You know how I know?
- 'Cause I was

28:48.191 --> 28:49.171
bringing the money back to you?

28:49.173 --> 28:51.002
Because that's what you
hired me to do, right?

28:51.005 --> 28:51.906
Open it.

28:51.909 --> 28:54.109
Oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah. It's all here.

28:54.111 --> 28:55.544
Promise. Most of it.

28:55.546 --> 28:56.612
I mean, you know,

28:56.614 --> 28:58.814
I... A few expenses...

28:58.817 --> 29:02.585
...that I had.

29:03.588 --> 29:05.087
I can explain.

29:05.089 --> 29:06.956
Aah!

29:08.459 --> 29:10.693
Where's the money?

29:10.695 --> 29:13.829
Put the gun down, Mr. Tasker.

29:13.831 --> 29:16.765
On the ground.

29:19.293 --> 29:21.019
Or you'll kill me, Ms. Vaughan?

29:21.022 --> 29:23.231
No, I'll shoot you in the shoulder,
causing you to drop the gun,

29:23.233 --> 29:24.833
and then I'll probably
shoot you in the thigh

29:24.835 --> 29:26.308
when you try to run away.

29:26.310 --> 29:27.743
And then I'll turn
you over to the police.

29:27.745 --> 29:28.944
Police can't keep you safe.

29:28.946 --> 29:30.679
The people I work
for... They'll just send

29:30.681 --> 29:33.449
other people like me 'til
they've got their money.

29:33.451 --> 29:35.484
Let's get you your money, then.

29:35.486 --> 29:37.786
You know where it is?

29:37.788 --> 29:40.089
No, but I'll find it.

29:40.091 --> 29:41.857
And it's in your best interest to let me

29:41.859 --> 29:44.026
because if you go back to your
bosses without their money,

29:44.028 --> 29:45.961
Tommy's not gonna be the
only one they want to kill.

29:48.633 --> 29:51.100
You have 12 hours.

29:51.102 --> 29:52.401
24.

29:54.813 --> 29:56.906
I'll be in touch.

30:01.112 --> 30:02.344
Thank you.

30:02.346 --> 30:04.446
Where's the money?

30:10.855 --> 30:13.055
So, what are we thinking?

30:13.057 --> 30:15.691
Leading with the
hamachi or the albacore?

30:15.693 --> 30:18.560
- The scallops, right?
- Oh, I forgot about the scallops.

30:21.432 --> 30:22.865
You can actually cook.

30:22.867 --> 30:24.900
It's not that impressive.

30:27.705 --> 30:29.071
Show-off.

30:32.609 --> 30:34.309
Tonight is all about the seduction.

30:34.312 --> 30:37.512
We're not here to close the
deal or even begin negotiations.

30:37.515 --> 30:39.581
We're here to give Kohana Takashi

30:39.583 --> 30:42.785
a taste of what she's been
missing now that Kenji's gone.

30:42.787 --> 30:45.587
Would you like some champagne?

30:45.589 --> 30:47.222
Oh, thank you.

30:48.592 --> 30:50.392
Cheers.

31:46.951 --> 31:49.474
Without saying a word, we will show her

31:49.477 --> 31:52.488
that we can deliver the
same way Kenji did...

31:52.490 --> 31:57.159
By delivering exactly what Kenji did.

31:57.161 --> 31:58.560
Fugu?

31:59.630 --> 32:02.231
We have a network of exclusive suppliers

32:02.233 --> 32:05.834
throughout Southeast Asia that
can move anything anywhere.

32:08.072 --> 32:09.238
Mom?

32:09.240 --> 32:10.439
Mmm!

32:10.441 --> 32:11.740
What are you doing?

32:11.742 --> 32:14.777
Enjoying myself for a change.

32:14.779 --> 32:16.979
Go play with your friends. Go on.

32:16.981 --> 32:18.881
What is that?

32:18.883 --> 32:21.216
Fugu. Pufferfish.

32:21.218 --> 32:23.385
It's poisonous. Have some.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.321
You are drunk.

32:26.324 --> 32:27.389
- No.
- Yes.

32:27.392 --> 32:28.824
You're going back to the consulate.

32:28.826 --> 32:30.492
- I'm calling a car. Let's go.
- What?!

32:30.494 --> 32:31.693
- Let's go.
- I'm fine.

32:31.695 --> 32:33.162
- No, no.
- I'm not drunk.

32:33.164 --> 32:35.531
I'm going to offer to drive Kohana home,

32:35.533 --> 32:36.698
since she's drunk

32:36.700 --> 32:39.334
and may confess who
knows what into my phone.

32:39.336 --> 32:41.336
- Well-done.
- Yes.

32:42.440 --> 32:45.107
Did you see Kohana's face
when she saw the fugu?

32:45.109 --> 32:45.909
Yeah.

32:45.912 --> 32:47.309
Almost as good as the look on your face

32:47.311 --> 32:48.961
when she groped you under the table.

32:48.964 --> 32:50.479
- You saw that, did you?
- Mm.

32:50.481 --> 32:52.081
My God, those hands... So strong.

32:52.083 --> 32:54.016
She could make diamonds
with those things.

32:54.018 --> 32:56.552
Yeah, the only problem is my
mom's not the diamond broker.

32:56.554 --> 32:58.787
I am.

33:01.859 --> 33:03.258
Mmm!

33:03.260 --> 33:04.927
Just like Kenji used to make.

33:04.929 --> 33:08.397
So, you're going to get
rid of all these people

33:08.399 --> 33:10.899
and you're going to tell
me what you did with Kenji,

33:10.901 --> 33:14.803
or Yumi here is going to kill you.

33:28.088 --> 33:29.955
The only reason I took the money...

33:29.958 --> 33:31.687
- Stop.
- ...was to lead them away from...

33:31.689 --> 33:32.921
Just stop.

33:32.923 --> 33:35.691
You just don't understand.

33:35.693 --> 33:39.304
Were you running drugs for them?

33:39.307 --> 33:40.468
God, no!

33:40.471 --> 33:41.730
I was just hired to make sure

33:41.732 --> 33:42.865
that no one was skimming off the top.

33:42.867 --> 33:44.433
And when you found
out the Kincaids were,

33:44.435 --> 33:45.767
you asked for a cut.

33:45.769 --> 33:47.688
Yeah, but I didn't know that
they were gonna get killed!

33:49.599 --> 33:51.106
Tommy Vaughan?

33:56.371 --> 33:58.771
What did you do?

34:01.051 --> 34:03.738
They're gonna keep you safe.

34:05.723 --> 34:08.090
- Allie.
- You have the right to remain silent.

34:08.092 --> 34:09.458
Allie. What did you do?

34:09.460 --> 34:12.127
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

34:12.129 --> 34:14.263
- Allie, don't do this.
- You have the right to an attorney.

34:14.264 --> 34:17.166
- Don't do this. Don't do this!
- If you cannot afford an attorney...

34:17.168 --> 34:18.900
Allie, please, I'm begging you!

34:18.902 --> 34:20.422
Allie! Allie!

34:37.817 --> 34:40.118
Lots of glass.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.585
What are you doing here?

34:41.588 --> 34:43.721
Killer sight lines from these windows.

34:43.723 --> 34:46.340
I'd shift your desk about
three feet to the left

34:46.342 --> 34:47.775
if I were you.

34:47.777 --> 34:51.400
'Cause you'd be easy pickings
from those vantage points.

34:51.402 --> 34:53.830
Is Margot with you?

34:53.833 --> 34:55.166
No.

34:55.168 --> 34:58.836
I came to give you a gift.

35:00.140 --> 35:01.806
Oh, what is it?

35:01.808 --> 35:03.841
Well, you gave me a finger...

35:03.843 --> 35:05.643
so I brought you a heart.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.745
What?

35:07.747 --> 35:09.247
I'm joking.

35:09.249 --> 35:10.915
It's a liver.

35:10.917 --> 35:12.517
Um...

35:13.611 --> 35:16.732
I'm joking, although you
might need a new liver

35:16.735 --> 35:18.768
if you drink it all by yourself.

35:19.840 --> 35:24.094
Uh, that's a-a $3,000 bottle of Bourbon.

35:24.097 --> 35:25.830
I can't accept that.

35:25.832 --> 35:28.399
Well, you did something nice for me.

35:28.401 --> 35:31.335
I gave you a dead woman's finger.

35:31.337 --> 35:33.337
You want me to take it away?

35:33.339 --> 35:36.073
Yes.

35:36.075 --> 35:38.009
No.

35:41.247 --> 35:43.614
You kill people for a living.

35:43.616 --> 35:46.150
We are never going to be friends.

35:46.152 --> 35:48.986
I kill people for a living.

35:48.988 --> 35:51.656
I don't have any friends.

35:51.659 --> 35:54.026
Just saying thanks.

36:08.641 --> 36:11.075
Oh, B-team, where's your better half?

36:11.077 --> 36:13.978
This is the woman who showed
up on the bank footage.

36:13.980 --> 36:15.913
She's the one who hired The Hammer.

36:15.915 --> 36:17.782
She's the one who wants you dead.

36:17.784 --> 36:20.251
Do you recognize her?

36:27.003 --> 36:29.126
I think the hat's a bit much, don't you?

36:29.128 --> 36:31.028
Do you know who she is or not?

36:34.801 --> 36:37.568
I do not.

36:37.570 --> 36:38.936
Do you?

36:38.938 --> 36:41.038
I ran her through our
facial-recognition software,

36:41.040 --> 36:42.907
- but there were no matches.
- Poor B-team.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.375
Can't you do anything without my help?

36:44.377 --> 36:46.077
Your help almost got me killed today.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.276
By a smoke bomb.

36:47.279 --> 36:50.848
By men with real guns who
thought it was a real bomb.

36:50.850 --> 36:52.517
Poor B-team. Were you frightened?

36:52.519 --> 36:54.252
You know what, I was.

36:54.254 --> 36:55.987
I was scared.

36:55.989 --> 36:58.322
I was scared I was gonna get shot

36:58.324 --> 37:01.626
saving the life of a mean,
spiteful, ungrateful...

37:01.628 --> 37:02.693
What is my name?

37:04.430 --> 37:06.197
Say my name.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.924
This doesn't mean that I don't hate you.

37:32.926 --> 37:34.158
I know. I know. Me, too.

37:39.432 --> 37:42.799
Now that we're alone, who are you two?

37:42.802 --> 37:44.936
Well, I'm Oswald Delacroix, and...

37:44.938 --> 37:46.170
No. And this...

37:46.172 --> 37:47.939
Who are you really?

37:49.175 --> 37:51.676
I'm Benjamin Jones, and
this is Rhys Griffiths,

37:51.678 --> 37:53.311
formerly of the Kensington Firm.

37:53.313 --> 37:54.912
Now that Kenji's gone,

37:54.914 --> 37:56.970
we can be the pipeline
for your product in the US.

37:56.973 --> 37:57.900
Why would I do that?

37:57.903 --> 38:00.084
You've already cost me $2
million in missed shipments.

38:00.086 --> 38:01.085
Well, let us make it up to you.

38:01.087 --> 38:02.186
Hmm, I'm thinking

38:02.188 --> 38:03.588
you should have stayed
with the Kensington Firm.

38:03.590 --> 38:04.722
$3 million.

38:04.724 --> 38:08.759
I can get you $3 million in cash.

38:08.761 --> 38:10.127
Okay. I'm listening.

38:10.129 --> 38:12.063
So am I.

38:12.065 --> 38:13.965
It belonged to Tommy Vaughan.

38:13.967 --> 38:15.140
You didn't.

38:15.143 --> 38:16.834
Well, how could I not?
Okay, where's the money?

38:16.836 --> 38:19.148
It's in my car.

38:19.151 --> 38:22.006
Okay, but I'm gonna need
some collateral, you know,

38:22.008 --> 38:23.774
to make sure you don't drive off.

38:23.776 --> 38:25.409
What kind of collateral?

38:25.411 --> 38:26.811
Aah!

38:27.847 --> 38:29.180
You.

38:29.182 --> 38:30.881
Get the cash.

38:30.883 --> 38:33.751
- What did you do that for?
- You hit on my mom, dude. Not cool.

38:33.753 --> 38:35.486
I'll be right back.

38:35.488 --> 38:36.887
Make it quick.

38:36.889 --> 38:39.457
This is the same knife
you used to carve the fugu,

38:39.459 --> 38:42.152
and it would be a shame
if he died from the toxin

38:42.155 --> 38:43.794
before you got him to the hospital.

39:22.869 --> 39:24.201
Hey!

39:24.203 --> 39:26.003
Oh, my God.

39:26.005 --> 39:28.172
- What are you doing here?
- Rhys stole Tommy's money.

39:28.174 --> 39:29.678
- I know. He told me.
- You knew?

39:29.681 --> 39:31.542
No, I didn't know. He just told me.

39:31.544 --> 39:33.778
Well, I made a deal with the
cartel. I'm giving it back.

39:33.780 --> 39:35.012
- You can't.
- Why not?

39:35.014 --> 39:36.781
Because if you don't give
it to me, Rhys is gonna die.

39:36.783 --> 39:39.150
But if I don't give it to
them, Tommy's gonna die.

39:39.152 --> 39:41.218
You understand Rhys is
like a brother to me.

39:41.220 --> 39:43.287
And you realize Tommy
actually is my brother.

39:43.289 --> 39:45.690
I have to go.

39:45.692 --> 39:46.857
Allie. Allie.

39:47.931 --> 39:49.598
Let go of the bag.

39:49.601 --> 39:51.434
I can't let him die.

39:51.437 --> 39:54.031
I'm holding a gun.

39:54.033 --> 39:55.299
So am I.
