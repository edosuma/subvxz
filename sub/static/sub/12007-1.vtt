00:00.386 --> 00:01.853
<i>Woman: Previously on Switched at Birth:</i>

00:01.987 --> 00:04.507
- Are you okay?
- This is your fault.

00:04.508 --> 00:09.440
_

00:09.441 --> 00:11.041
_

00:11.042 --> 00:12.587
I thought about Angelo's
insurance settlement.

00:12.843 --> 00:15.300
Maybe we could use some of it to help get

00:15.301 --> 00:16.916
Melody's new program off the ground.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.684
- What's wrong?
- I did some coke.

00:18.719 --> 00:19.952
- That stuff is addictive!
- I'm fine.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.854
You are not the only
one going through stuff!

00:21.889 --> 00:24.457
If you're really pissed at your
ma, and you need her to know,

00:24.491 --> 00:25.458
then you gotta show her.

00:25.492 --> 00:28.561
Sometimes you gotta show.

00:28.595 --> 00:31.330
- This is Detective Mark.
- Is something wrong?

00:31.365 --> 00:33.733
- She's here to arrest you.
- I'm gonna take the plea deal.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.635
You have a record. You'll go to prison.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.403
It is only three months.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.472
You will go to Gallaudet,
and then med school.

00:39.506 --> 00:41.374
Convicted felons don't go to med school.

00:41.408 --> 00:44.544
- A couple weeks ago...
- I vandalized the construction site.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.512
She was there to stop me.

00:46.513 --> 00:47.699
_

00:47.700 --> 00:50.380
_

00:50.381 --> 00:51.460
_

00:57.157 --> 01:00.960
It was my first offense,
and whatever happens

01:00.994 --> 01:04.796
- will be better than what she would...
- _

01:05.899 --> 01:09.802
You'll go, and I will
come as soon as I can.

01:09.803 --> 01:13.308
_

01:13.740 --> 01:16.876
Because I didn't want
to be talked out of it.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.846
Emmett, I knew if I
didn't go through with it,

01:19.880 --> 01:23.716
I was gonna regret it every single day,

01:23.750 --> 01:27.520
knowing that I could've
done something, but I didn't.

01:27.521 --> 01:30.660
_

01:30.664 --> 01:33.459
This is Daphne we're
talking about. Her dad died.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.020
_

01:35.021 --> 01:39.230
_

01:39.231 --> 01:40.948
_

01:40.951 --> 01:45.638
She had a lot more than I did
to work through with Angelo.

01:45.708 --> 01:50.279
Look, it is a few months in L.A. without me,

01:50.313 --> 01:54.316
and this way, she doesn't
have to go to prison,

01:54.350 --> 01:56.218
and she gets to be a doctor.

01:57.320 --> 02:01.990
I saved my sister's life,

02:02.025 --> 02:03.125
and I feel lucky.

02:05.395 --> 02:07.195
I feel great.

02:10.436 --> 02:13.060
_

02:13.061 --> 02:15.741
_

02:15.742 --> 02:19.025
_

02:19.075 --> 02:21.109
It's all gonna work out.

02:24.180 --> 02:26.148
I promise.

02:29.986 --> 02:32.854
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

02:32.889 --> 02:35.991
Wait a sec, wait a sec. So
she took the blame for you?

02:36.025 --> 02:39.728
She pretended that she was the one...

02:39.762 --> 02:43.532
How did she even think of
that? That is brilliant!

02:43.566 --> 02:45.734
Brilliant? It's insane! And illegal.

02:45.768 --> 02:47.602
John: Wait a second. Let me
think this through. Hold on.

02:47.637 --> 02:49.671
Where is she now? Not
still at the police station?

02:49.706 --> 02:52.574
No, she made a statement
and they let her go.

02:52.608 --> 02:55.310
She's free until her court date.
Right now she's at Emmett's.

02:55.345 --> 02:58.513
No, no! We can't tell
anyone about this! Okay?

02:58.548 --> 03:01.316
All right. Only Emmett.
But that's it, okay?

03:01.351 --> 03:04.052
This cannot get out. Does
everyone understand this?

03:04.087 --> 03:05.137
We need to undo this.

03:05.138 --> 03:08.221
We need to go back there
and tell them it's a lie!

03:08.227 --> 03:09.836
John: Kathryn, we can't do that.

03:09.837 --> 03:12.270
If we go back there,
both girls get in trouble.

03:12.271 --> 03:13.028
Damn it!

03:14.063 --> 03:16.131
Regina: She's here.

03:16.165 --> 03:19.334
Why didn't you talk to us
before you did anything?

03:19.369 --> 03:22.037
Everything happened so fast.

03:22.071 --> 03:24.873
Bay said it and the
detective was staring at us...

03:26.809 --> 03:28.910
- Baby!
- Hi.

03:28.945 --> 03:31.179
Baby, what did you do?

03:31.214 --> 03:35.650
Honey, that was an
incredibly brave thing to do.

03:35.685 --> 03:38.854
Potentially really stupid,
but incredibly brave.

03:38.921 --> 03:41.890
I don't know what to say.

03:41.924 --> 03:44.960
I don't know if I should let you
do this or if I should stop you.

03:44.994 --> 03:47.796
Guys, it's done.

03:47.830 --> 03:53.502
I'm okay. Daphne's gonna
be okay. We're good now.

03:53.536 --> 03:55.404
We're fine.

03:55.438 --> 03:58.373
<i>Woman: Bay Madeline Kennish,
you are under house arrest.</i>

03:58.408 --> 04:01.576
This monitor will not come off
until your sentence is completed.

04:01.611 --> 04:04.646
You will bathe with it. You will
eat with it. You will sleep with it.

04:04.680 --> 04:08.750
You have a curfew of seven
PM. That doesn't mean 7:02.

04:08.785 --> 04:11.353
That doesn't mean seven
o'clock and 23 seconds.

04:11.387 --> 04:13.355
It means seven PM.

04:13.389 --> 04:15.424
If you enter your house after your curfew,

04:15.458 --> 04:17.625
the bracelet will beep and
alert me that you are late.

04:17.660 --> 04:22.397
<i>You will receive an automatic call that
you must answer within three minutes.</i>

These need to be put in the mail today

04:39.522 --> 04:41.256
if they' gonna be there
by the time we arrive.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.424
I know.

04:44.594 --> 04:48.330
I can't believe the next time I'll
be back here will be Christmas.

04:48.364 --> 04:53.235

- Oh!

05:08.518 --> 05:11.660
_

05:11.661 --> 05:14.256
I'm sorry. It's the stupid thing.

05:14.290 --> 05:17.259
And the light is orange.
It needs to be recharged.

05:17.293 --> 05:19.227
Like, now. Ugh.

05:19.228 --> 05:21.439
_

05:25.234 --> 05:27.569
I just don't want them to
call and then for my parents

05:27.603 --> 05:31.340
to find out that something
else is going on up here

05:31.374 --> 05:34.176
besides movie watching.

05:38.314 --> 05:41.550
We still have four days until you leave.

05:42.501 --> 05:45.486
_

05:45.488 --> 05:49.191
Well, I can be very convincing.

05:50.602 --> 05:53.770
_

05:53.771 --> 05:58.467
_

05:58.468 --> 06:00.369
I was! It worked!

06:00.370 --> 06:03.693
_

06:03.740 --> 06:09.144
In 87 days. The minute
that this bad boy is off

06:09.178 --> 06:14.116
and I am done with my community
service, I am on a plane to you.

06:17.404 --> 06:20.037
_

06:26.329 --> 06:28.430
Ah! First day on the chain gang?

06:28.464 --> 06:33.168
Ha. Finally. The wheels of justice
move slowly, but they have arrived.

06:33.202 --> 06:35.604
You know, I'm actually weirdly excited.

06:35.638 --> 06:39.174
Get it started, get it over with.

06:39.208 --> 06:42.177
- Hey. Good morning.
- Hi. Wow.

06:42.211 --> 06:45.247
It's fusilli with spicy sausage

06:45.281 --> 06:50.419
and cherry tomatoes and
homemade linzer cookies.

06:50.453 --> 06:54.356
But if you prefer gingersnaps,
I baked those, too.

06:54.390 --> 06:58.126
Wow. That is the single most gourmet lunch

06:58.161 --> 07:01.363
to ever going be consumed
underneath a freeway overpass.

07:01.397 --> 07:03.331
(Laughs) Do we need to get going?

07:03.366 --> 07:07.402
- Uh... oh, yes. We do. Ha!
- Bye, guys.

07:07.437 --> 07:09.438
- All: Bye!
- Have fun at community service.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.540
Regina, you want an espresso, or... ?

07:11.574 --> 07:16.178
No, thanks. I'm actually
here to give my notice.

07:16.212 --> 07:18.413
Wait. You're moving out?

07:18.448 --> 07:22.150
The arrangement was that
Daphne and I would move in

07:22.185 --> 07:23.518
so we could all get to know each other.

07:23.553 --> 07:26.188
And the girls are gonna
be out of the house soon.

07:26.222 --> 07:30.125
That arrangement has
come to its natural end.

07:30.159 --> 07:32.294
- Yeah, I guess that's true.
- No, you don't have to go.

07:32.328 --> 07:35.097
I appreciate that, but it's time.

07:35.131 --> 07:37.165
I'm gonna start looking this month,

07:37.200 --> 07:42.070
and when Bay leaves for
L.A., I'll leave, too.

07:57.019 --> 07:59.788
- Bay: Thanks for the ride.
- Hey, so if you need anything

07:59.822 --> 08:01.890
while you're out here, just call me.

08:01.958 --> 08:04.893
Like a hat, sunscreen, or a drink...

08:04.927 --> 08:07.562
Daphne, just stop.

08:07.597 --> 08:09.631
It's really not a big deal. I...

08:09.665 --> 08:15.504
I appreciate everything that
you have done to thank me.

08:15.538 --> 08:18.673
But what I really want is for things

08:18.708 --> 08:21.443
to just go back to normal between us.

08:21.477 --> 08:24.779
I'm not gonna just sit back
and live my life while you...

08:24.814 --> 08:29.684
but that is exactly what I want you to do.

08:32.755 --> 08:37.626
Look. I did what I did
for the whole family.

08:37.659 --> 08:39.561
Angelo died.

08:39.595 --> 08:44.299
And that was enough awfulness for one year.

08:44.333 --> 08:50.038
We didn't need you being emotionally
terrorized in lady jail, too.

08:51.207 --> 08:54.075
So go pack.

08:54.110 --> 08:57.012
Go be a college student.

08:57.046 --> 08:58.313
Be a great doctor.

08:58.347 --> 09:01.149
And that is the best way to repay me.

09:04.220 --> 09:05.854
Okay.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.835
(Indistinct chatter)

09:30.646 --> 09:31.580
(Laughs)

09:34.917 --> 09:38.520
Congratulations. (Laughs)

09:38.554 --> 09:41.489
This is amazing.

09:41.490 --> 09:44.753
_

09:46.596 --> 09:49.698
I think Angelo would be happy.

09:49.732 --> 09:51.366
Hey, Regina. I'm sorry to interrupt

09:51.434 --> 09:54.369
Melody, some parents want to meet you.

09:54.403 --> 09:58.240
- Okay...
- Go, go. Go. (Laughs)

10:05.548 --> 10:08.416
(Laughs, sighs)

10:18.815 --> 10:20.242
_

10:20.243 --> 10:21.831
_

10:21.832 --> 10:22.947
_

10:22.965 --> 10:25.200
Hey. What's up? How's it going?

10:25.234 --> 10:27.202
Hey.

10:31.003 --> 10:33.587
_

10:33.590 --> 10:36.845
Oh, no. I'm just here
for the free sandwiches.

10:36.879 --> 10:39.748
Well, and to support my girl.

10:42.939 --> 10:45.850
_

10:45.851 --> 10:47.010
_

10:47.011 --> 10:49.891
- _
- All right. See you later.

10:52.862 --> 10:55.397
Hey, so, um, what's up?

10:55.431 --> 10:57.499
I feel like I haven't seen you all summer.

10:57.533 --> 10:58.733
Well, yeah, I mean, you know,

10:58.768 --> 11:03.605
most nights my gigs, they
don't get over until 3:00.

11:03.639 --> 11:05.440
So...

11:05.474 --> 11:08.410
And I've just been hanging out with Lily.

11:08.444 --> 11:11.479
Yeah. I know. I...

11:11.514 --> 11:14.282
I guess I just feel like
you've been avoiding me.

11:15.651 --> 11:20.155
So, uh, when do you leave, uh, for D.C.?

11:20.189 --> 11:21.156
Tuesday.

11:21.190 --> 11:22.524
Soon you're gonna be at parties,

11:22.558 --> 11:24.125
dancing on tables.

11:24.193 --> 11:28.296
You're acting like I'm
some wet T-shirt girl.

11:28.331 --> 11:30.198
I'm going for pre-med classes.

11:30.232 --> 11:34.002
Yeah, while she's here
cleaning up your mess.

11:34.036 --> 11:36.037
(Sighs) It was her idea.

11:36.072 --> 11:37.939
Yeah, and you let her go through with it.

11:37.973 --> 11:40.275
I was going to prison!

11:40.309 --> 11:42.210
I never would have been
able to be a doctor.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.045
Yeah, I heard that, I know.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.214
Toby, it's community service,

11:46.248 --> 11:49.184
probation and that stupid anklet thing.

11:49.218 --> 11:51.019
And then she's done.

11:51.053 --> 11:54.022
It's a huge sacrifice, I
know, but she saved my life.

11:54.056 --> 11:56.624
What if she would have
gotten some hard-ass judge

11:56.659 --> 11:58.893
who wanted to teach her a lesson?

11:58.928 --> 12:00.795
She could've gotten a lot worse!

12:00.830 --> 12:02.664
But she didn't. And it wasn't likely.

12:02.698 --> 12:05.700
She took a huge chance for you.

12:05.735 --> 12:08.470
I know, and I am so grateful.

12:08.504 --> 12:12.507
Then I don't get how you can
just go off and leave her here,

12:12.541 --> 12:14.442
even for a second.

12:15.544 --> 12:18.747
I think about everything that you did

12:18.781 --> 12:21.383
and I don't... I don't get it.

12:21.417 --> 12:25.253
You destroyed a tractor with a crowbar,

12:25.287 --> 12:27.489
with some dude who arranged for a brick

12:27.523 --> 12:30.425
to be thrown at your mom's head?

12:30.459 --> 12:34.262
- I don't get that.
- Me either.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.264
I'm still trying to figure it out.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.333
Well, good luck with that.

12:38.367 --> 12:41.436
Good luck trying to figure it all out.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.471
I'll see you at Christmas.

12:56.078 --> 12:58.246
- Hey.
- What's up?

13:00.149 --> 13:02.217
This sucks.

13:02.251 --> 13:04.452
- Try it hung over in a hailstorm.
- Yikes.

13:06.355 --> 13:08.223
And don't get on these guys' bad side.

13:08.257 --> 13:10.158
Breathe wrong and they'll write you up.

13:10.192 --> 13:11.893
Good to know. Thanks.

13:13.229 --> 13:15.063
- DUI?
- Oh, me?

13:15.097 --> 13:17.132
Oh, God, no. (Laughs)

13:17.166 --> 13:19.200
I mean, like, that's the most
selfish thing that you can ever do.

13:19.235 --> 13:21.136
Get into a car drunk?

13:22.972 --> 13:25.006
You're here for a DUI, aren't you?

13:25.041 --> 13:28.143
It was like two beers, but because
I'm under 21, they ding you.

13:28.177 --> 13:32.047
And they slapped on a disorderly
conduct charge, resisting arrest.

13:32.081 --> 13:34.583
- Huh.
- I got a couple days in jail

13:34.617 --> 13:37.886
and a fine of a thousand bucks, which I
didn't have, so I had to do this instead.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.622
- You were in jail?
- Yeah, wasn't that bad.

13:40.656 --> 13:41.856
Except I had to give my kid to my aunt.

13:41.891 --> 13:43.558
She's kind of pissy about watching him.

13:43.593 --> 13:44.793
You have a kid?

13:44.827 --> 13:46.895
Yeah. Fifteen months. Just started walking.

13:46.929 --> 13:49.664
Uh...

13:49.699 --> 13:53.335
Uh, so are you... married?

13:53.369 --> 13:55.337
To that guy? Hell, no.

13:55.371 --> 13:58.306
I got somebody now, though.

13:58.341 --> 14:01.276
Robbie. Tall guy, goatee.

14:01.310 --> 14:03.612
- Bay: Oh, he's cute.
- We met here. Romantic, right?

14:03.646 --> 14:06.548
- (Laughs)
- Good news is he likes my kid.

14:06.582 --> 14:07.969
That is good.

14:07.970 --> 14:09.960
We're gonna move in
together in a couple months.

14:10.620 --> 14:12.520
What about you? What are you in for?

14:12.555 --> 14:16.057
Uh... first degree felony,

14:16.092 --> 14:19.160
uh, property damage and tampering.

14:19.195 --> 14:23.164
I trashed this construction site
with a buddy of mine. It was stupid.

14:23.199 --> 14:26.301
- Bet it was hella fun, though.
- Yeah.

14:26.335 --> 14:28.336
Why'd you do it?

14:28.371 --> 14:32.240
I was... wasted. You know.

14:32.274 --> 14:34.275
- You're lying.
- No.

14:34.310 --> 14:37.112
Yeah, you are. I grew up
around a bunch of liars.

14:37.146 --> 14:39.398
If I have one talent in the world,
it's knowing when someone is lying.

14:39.399 --> 14:41.063
And you are a liar.

14:41.083 --> 14:44.085
Look, I just can't get into it here.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.887
Then that's what you should have said.

14:45.921 --> 14:48.123
- It's complicated.
- Don't care.

14:50.926 --> 14:54.996
Lily: I want to take this
opportunity to welcome you all

14:55.031 --> 14:59.901
to the first class of the Midwest
Institute for the Deaf at UMKC!

14:59.935 --> 15:02.871
(Cheering)

15:02.905 --> 15:04.773
Lily: I know a lot of
you had other options,

15:04.807 --> 15:08.677
bigger programs with longer track records.

15:08.711 --> 15:10.578
But we hope to offer
you something different.

15:10.613 --> 15:13.415
A family feel.

15:13.449 --> 15:15.483
The first year of college is amazing.

15:15.518 --> 15:18.453
It's exciting to be
independent and away from home.

15:18.487 --> 15:22.390
But it can be scary, and
it's easy to feel alone.

15:22.425 --> 15:27.328
But I want you to know that
you are not alone. I am here.

15:27.363 --> 15:29.531
Lily is here.

15:29.565 --> 15:32.167
The people on the left
and right of you right now

15:32.201 --> 15:35.236
are your new family.

15:35.271 --> 15:37.072
Whatever we go through this year,

15:37.106 --> 15:40.075
and I can guarantee we
will go through a lot,

15:40.109 --> 15:43.111
we are in this together.

15:45.081 --> 15:48.249
It's like one impulsive decision
after another with you two.

15:48.284 --> 15:52.153
I don't understand what happened.
And did you tell Gallaudet?

15:52.188 --> 15:54.856
I told them that I got another offer.

15:54.890 --> 15:56.725
And I already spoke to Melody.

15:56.759 --> 15:58.193
She said that she has space in her program

15:58.227 --> 16:00.095
and she's excited that I'm staying.

16:00.129 --> 16:02.030
Did you tell Regina?

16:02.064 --> 16:05.700
She said that as long as I'm in
college somewhere, she's fine with it.

16:05.735 --> 16:07.310
We had a plan, okay? The plan was

16:07.311 --> 16:10.105
you go to Gallaudet and
you take pre-med classes.

16:10.106 --> 16:11.973
I can do that here, too.

16:12.007 --> 16:14.509
Core classes in the deaf program

16:14.577 --> 16:17.679
and one or two pre-med
classes at the regular school.

16:17.713 --> 16:20.073
Bay is gonna be gone in a couple of months.

16:20.074 --> 16:21.917
You understand that, right?

16:21.918 --> 16:25.787
I'm doing it to be around
for her, but also for me.

16:25.821 --> 16:29.724
You guys, I lost my mind last year.

16:29.759 --> 16:31.760
I look back at the things that I did,

16:31.794 --> 16:34.496
and I don't even know who that was.

16:34.530 --> 16:38.399
I'm not ready to be thousands of
miles away from home right now.

16:38.434 --> 16:42.203
I should've said that weeks ago, but...

16:42.238 --> 16:44.339
I was just afraid of letting you guys down.

17:30.820 --> 17:33.655

- Will do.

18:04.453 --> 18:06.921
Excuse me. Hi.

18:06.956 --> 18:09.958
Uh, your sister, Marci,
she dropped off your lunch.

18:09.992 --> 18:13.228
No kidding. This is really nice of her.

18:13.262 --> 18:16.865

18:33.649 --> 18:34.682
What was that?

18:34.717 --> 18:37.752
Uh, I was just delivering his lunch.

18:37.786 --> 18:38.953
Didn't I make it clear that I'm with him?

18:38.988 --> 18:41.623
Look, I have a boyfriend.
A serious boyfriend.

18:41.657 --> 18:43.591
- I'm not interested...
- Just stay away from him.

18:43.626 --> 18:46.628
Is that so hard to understand? Stay away.

- Hi.
- Hello.

21:09.133 --> 21:13.003
Uh, I need to sign up for core
classes for the deaf program.

21:13.037 --> 21:14.771
What deaf program?

21:14.806 --> 21:16.006
The new...

21:16.040 --> 21:17.174
Uh...

21:17.208 --> 21:20.043
Do we have a deaf program?

21:20.078 --> 21:22.079
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

21:24.682 --> 21:27.584
Okay, someone's coming down.
Just step aside and wait.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.787
Actually, I need to sign up for a class

21:30.822 --> 21:32.923
in the other part of the school as well.

21:32.957 --> 21:34.925
Chem 1 with Professor Marillo?

21:34.959 --> 21:37.628
- Filled.
- How do you know that?

21:37.662 --> 21:41.365
Because it fills up every year
weeks before classes even start.

21:41.399 --> 21:42.699
Those pre-med students are on it.

21:44.602 --> 21:46.236
Next!

21:46.271 --> 21:47.571
Daphne: Professor Marillo?

21:47.605 --> 21:51.275
- Yes.
- Hi. I'm Daphne Vasquez, freshman.

21:51.309 --> 21:54.211
And I heard that your
chemistry 1 class was filled,

21:54.245 --> 21:57.547
and I was hoping to
persuade you to let me in.

21:57.582 --> 22:01.418
Well, you know, with the first
hundred, I get absolutely no say.

22:01.452 --> 22:03.320
But with add-ons,

22:03.354 --> 22:06.056
I get to decide if you're
worth the extra trouble.

22:06.090 --> 22:08.191
I think I am, ma'am.

22:08.226 --> 22:13.163
So... tell me something about yourself.

22:13.197 --> 22:16.233
Well, I'm Puerto Rican. And
I grew up in East River...

22:16.267 --> 22:19.236
Puerto Rican and red-headed?

22:19.270 --> 22:21.905
That's not even the most
interesting thing about me.

22:21.939 --> 22:26.043
I had a red-haired Chinese student once.

22:26.077 --> 22:27.177
Do you know what the odds of that are?

22:27.211 --> 22:29.713
I'd imagine pretty small.

22:29.747 --> 22:33.116
Maybe one in 100,000 people.
It requires a genetic mutation.

22:33.151 --> 22:35.886
Never seen it before or since.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.722
The reason I have red hair
is completely different.

22:38.756 --> 22:40.023
Hm.

22:40.058 --> 22:41.992
Do you know what the gene

22:42.026 --> 22:44.895
that causes red hair is called?

22:44.929 --> 22:47.431
I do.

22:47.465 --> 22:50.701
The melanocortin 1 receptor, or MCR1.

22:50.735 --> 22:52.836
- Also considered a mutation.
- That's right.

22:52.870 --> 22:57.774
There are studies saying that redheads
are more sensitive to thermal pain, but...

22:57.809 --> 22:59.743
Less sensitive to electrical pain.

22:59.777 --> 23:03.380
Okay, so you either just got

23:03.414 --> 23:05.482
very lucky with that question,

23:05.516 --> 23:08.418
or you know a whole lot
about pain management.

23:08.453 --> 23:13.190
Well, if you grew up the only
redhead in your entire family,

23:13.224 --> 23:15.592
with everyone commenting on it constantly,

23:15.626 --> 23:18.261
you'd learn everything
you could about it, too.

23:19.597 --> 23:21.331
You're hard of hearing?

23:21.366 --> 23:24.368
Fully deaf. But I read lips really well.

23:28.339 --> 23:29.339
Give me that form.

23:31.175 --> 23:33.243
Thank you so much, Professor.

23:33.277 --> 23:36.413
Now, I assume you have an interpreter.

23:36.447 --> 23:38.949
Yeah, there are lots of
interpreters available to us.

23:38.983 --> 23:40.150
I just have to check their schedules.

23:40.184 --> 23:41.284
No, no, no.

23:41.319 --> 23:43.920
You're going to need someone who is fluent

23:43.955 --> 23:46.757
in the basic concepts and
the vocabulary of chemistry.

23:46.791 --> 23:51.161
Professor, the Venn diagram of people
who are fluent in American Sign Language

23:51.195 --> 23:53.997
and know chemistry and are available

23:54.031 --> 23:56.733
at the exact time that we have
lecture has got to be minute.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.069
This is not discouragement.

23:59.103 --> 24:03.740
This is a reality check.
We go 90 miles an hour.

24:03.775 --> 24:07.978
Now, get someone who knows what the hell
they're talking about or you will drown.

24:08.012 --> 24:13.016
Someone fluent in ASL and
chemistry, before Monday.

24:13.050 --> 24:16.686
I met a red-haired Chinese girl once.

24:16.721 --> 24:21.558
Just because it's rare
doesn't mean it's impossible.

24:30.001 --> 24:30.934
23 minutes.

24:30.935 --> 24:32.520
_

24:33.274 --> 24:35.849
Ugh! Okay, I have to get home!

24:35.850 --> 24:37.882
_

24:37.979 --> 24:40.047
I'm gonna have to call
somebody to pick me up.

24:40.048 --> 24:42.884
_

24:42.885 --> 24:44.486
_

24:44.619 --> 24:46.620
Okay, you keep saying that,

24:46.655 --> 24:50.558
and it keeps making that awful
noise and I really have to go!

24:50.559 --> 24:51.390
_

24:51.593 --> 24:54.628
Well, try harder, please!

25:00.229 --> 25:06.250
_

25:07.576 --> 25:09.410
Emmett.

25:12.681 --> 25:15.706
- (Engine starts)
- _

25:22.457 --> 25:25.359
- (Beeping)
- John: What? Where were you?

25:25.393 --> 25:26.560
- We were calling!
- Did they call?

25:26.595 --> 25:29.230
Yes. You have to see your
probation officer tomorrow.

25:29.264 --> 25:30.998
- Damn it!
- What happened?

25:31.033 --> 25:34.201
- When does that thing shut off?
- It's supposed to as soon as I get into the house!

25:34.236 --> 25:36.403
- It's like they're trying to torment me!
- Don't do that!

25:36.438 --> 25:38.172
You're not supposed to mess with it!

25:38.206 --> 25:40.007
First Emmett's motorcycle wouldn't start.

25:40.041 --> 25:41.909
And then there was construction on Anson.

25:41.943 --> 25:43.244
- So we went a little bit faster.
- You were speeding?

25:43.278 --> 25:45.913
- On a motorcycle?
- He was doing it to get me home on time!

25:45.947 --> 25:48.773
I don't care! You're not allowed to
ride on that bike if he's speeding!

25:48.808 --> 25:51.127
Well, he got a ticket, so
that should make you happy.

25:51.128 --> 25:53.778
- For $200!
- Is that thing gonna turn off or not?

25:53.813 --> 25:55.714
- (Beeping)
- Oh!

25:55.748 --> 25:57.749
- (Stops beeping)
- (Sighs)

26:00.019 --> 26:04.689
I just want to take it off for
five minutes. Just five minutes.

26:11.797 --> 26:13.732
- Hi!
- Hi, hi.

26:13.766 --> 26:18.670
Uh, I'm Iris. Iris. My name sign is...

26:18.704 --> 26:21.773
I've had glasses since I was
four. Worst eyes on the planet.

26:21.807 --> 26:26.378
- (Laughs) Daphne. Hi.
- I'm her mom, Regina.

26:26.412 --> 26:28.280
Um, I'm her other mom, Kathryn.

26:28.314 --> 26:31.316
Hi. John Kennish. Nice to meet you.

26:31.350 --> 26:32.551
You're all hearing.

26:32.585 --> 26:34.686
Yep. Only deafie in the family.

26:34.720 --> 26:38.189
Well, I'm hearing, too. I'm
in the interpreter program.

26:38.224 --> 26:39.864
- Oh, cool.
- I'm so sorry,

26:39.865 --> 26:41.158
I didn't think I was getting a roommate,

26:41.160 --> 26:44.296
so I sort of spread out. Let me clean up.

26:44.330 --> 26:48.333
- Are your parents here, Iris?
- God, I wish.

26:48.367 --> 26:50.435
They're back home... Alaska.

26:50.469 --> 26:52.404
So, Iris, what are you
doing all the way here?

26:52.438 --> 26:54.406
My cousin goes here.

26:54.440 --> 26:57.108
He's the one that told
me about the deaf program.

26:57.143 --> 27:00.178
- Oh, is he deaf?
- No. But his parents are.

27:00.212 --> 27:04.849
- Well, it's a great school.
- My cousin had a really hard time last year.

27:04.884 --> 27:07.118
I mean, he kind of had, like,
a mini nervous breakdown,

27:07.153 --> 27:10.255
so my parents were slightly
freaked out about me coming here.

27:10.289 --> 27:12.090
But that's probably 'cause he was pre-med.

27:12.124 --> 27:14.159
I mean, the pre-med program here

27:14.193 --> 27:16.728
is legendary for messing with your head.

27:20.900 --> 27:21.900
Daphne's pre-med.

27:21.934 --> 27:24.135
Oh, God!

27:24.170 --> 27:25.937
I'm sure you'll do great.

27:25.972 --> 27:28.707
He's really intense. He's
too intense for his own good.

27:28.741 --> 27:31.643
I... I wouldn't worry about it.

27:31.677 --> 27:33.745
Honey, you're gonna do fine.

27:33.779 --> 27:35.847
Absolutely.

27:39.552 --> 27:43.521
And then his motorcycle wouldn't start,
which has literally never happened before.

27:43.556 --> 27:45.590
And then he got pulled
over, and he got a ticket,

27:45.625 --> 27:47.592
and I tried explaining to
the cop that I have a curfew,

27:47.627 --> 27:49.494
but that didn't go over so well.

27:49.528 --> 27:52.364
What are you talking about?

27:52.398 --> 27:53.565
I'm... (Laughs)

27:53.599 --> 27:55.667
I'm talking about why
I was late last night.

27:55.701 --> 27:58.436
You think you were called in
to see me because you were late?

27:58.471 --> 28:00.405
Why was I called in to see you?

28:00.439 --> 28:02.195
Did you hand a turkey
sandwich and a bag of chips

28:02.196 --> 28:03.939
to someone on your work crew yesterday?

28:04.610 --> 28:07.212
A guy named Robert P. Nicholson?

28:07.246 --> 28:08.680
Yeah.

28:08.714 --> 28:12.150
Were you aware that Mr. Nicholson is
an inmate in the Kansas state prison?

28:12.184 --> 28:15.186
- What?
- He does his work detail during the day

28:15.221 --> 28:16.421
and serves his time at night.

28:16.455 --> 28:18.490
There are four offenders on the work crew

28:18.524 --> 28:22.260
who are serving prison sentences
concurrently with their work hours.

28:22.294 --> 28:24.095
Didn't you notice the sheriff?

28:24.130 --> 28:26.998
I guess I noticed him...

28:27.033 --> 28:28.233
What do you think he was doing there?

28:28.267 --> 28:31.036
I have no idea. How am I
supposed to know that there's...

28:31.070 --> 28:33.171
- There's criminals there...
- And I suppose you're telling me

28:33.205 --> 28:36.841
that you didn't know that the turkey
sandwich that you so stupidly handed over

28:36.876 --> 28:39.210
to an inmate had a bag of
heroin stuffed inside it?

28:39.245 --> 28:42.947
- Oh, my God.
- Congratulations, Ms. Kennish.

28:42.982 --> 28:46.084
You just became an accessory
to a felony drug deal.

28:49.883 --> 28:51.217
I am so pleased to know that my daughter

28:51.251 --> 28:53.886
is working next to hardened criminals
and no one thought to tell us.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.922
My probation officer said that she
could've thrown my case back to court,

28:56.957 --> 28:59.859
rescinded my probation and
then tossed me in prison.

28:59.893 --> 29:01.627
- What?!
- But she did me a favor

29:01.662 --> 29:04.964
and just gave me a hundred
more days on probation.

29:04.998 --> 29:07.833
Thank God it wasn't any more house
arrest. I'm just grateful for that.

29:09.670 --> 29:12.438
But if you're on probation...

29:12.472 --> 29:15.441
Yeah. There goes my L.A. plan.

29:17.644 --> 29:19.679
You'll just join Emmett
a hundred days later.

29:19.713 --> 29:21.714
Which I can't wait to tell him.

29:21.782 --> 29:23.628
But this is absurd.

29:23.629 --> 29:26.795
They can't actually believe that
you were part of a drug ring.

29:26.823 --> 29:28.487
Why wouldn't they believe that?

29:28.582 --> 29:33.486
I pled guilty to felony
property damage with a crowbar.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.688
To her, I'm just a criminal.

29:39.089 --> 29:43.004
_

29:43.005 --> 29:47.196
_

29:47.197 --> 29:52.033
_

29:52.034 --> 29:54.546
_

29:54.547 --> 30:00.791
_

30:01.692 --> 30:04.068
_

30:04.117 --> 30:06.986
There's my cousin! Josh!

30:07.020 --> 30:09.122
I told you I'm not going to
that freshman party with you.

30:09.123 --> 30:09.950
I'm a sophomore now.

30:09.952 --> 30:11.323
Find someone else to babysit you.

30:11.358 --> 30:14.994
- Josh, this is my roommate, Daphne.
- Hey.

30:15.028 --> 30:18.998
Daphne has a favor she needs to ask you.

30:19.032 --> 30:22.034
Hey. So I have a proposition for you.

30:22.068 --> 30:25.204
How would you like to make a
whole lot of money this semester?

30:27.040 --> 30:31.010
I just signed up for Professor
Marillo's chem 1 class.

30:31.044 --> 30:34.814
- Why?
- Because I'm pre-med.

30:34.848 --> 30:36.916
But why do you want to be a doctor?

30:36.950 --> 30:39.718
Do you even know the satisfaction
level of doctors today?

30:39.753 --> 30:42.598
- It's like 5%.
- That can't be right.

30:42.599 --> 30:43.499
Where did you get that number?

30:43.523 --> 30:45.724
They are prisoners of
the insurance companies,

30:45.759 --> 30:47.526
malpractice lawsuits,

30:47.561 --> 30:49.662
and let's not even get started
on the pharmaceutical companies.

30:49.696 --> 30:53.465
- Things have changed, yes...
- And the people in pre-med?

30:53.533 --> 30:56.502
They're self-absorbed,
grade-grubbing freaks.

30:56.536 --> 31:00.539
- Josh, just listen to her.
- Daphne: Here's the deal.

31:00.574 --> 31:02.675
I need an interpreter for her class.

31:02.709 --> 31:05.644
And Iris mentioned that you
had taken the class and you...

31:05.679 --> 31:10.616
You want me to be an
interpreter for Marillo?

31:10.650 --> 31:14.253
I would literally rather be dissected alive

31:14.287 --> 31:15.621
than set foot in that class again.

31:15.655 --> 31:19.358
- Josh, come on.
- I spent every waking moment

31:19.426 --> 31:22.328
my freshman year studying for that woman.

31:22.362 --> 31:26.365
On the bus, on the john,
at my cousin's wedding.

31:26.399 --> 31:31.437
- I'm sure it's a tough class.
- I never put that book down.

31:31.471 --> 31:33.205
Never.

31:33.240 --> 31:37.009
I'm not asking you to retake
the class, just interpret.

31:37.043 --> 31:39.979
Not just anyone can be an interpreter.

31:40.013 --> 31:42.081
You have to be certified, which I am not.

31:42.115 --> 31:44.884
- But there's no one else, so...
- And furthermore,

31:44.918 --> 31:49.221
interpreters go to
lectures, labs, study groups,

31:49.256 --> 31:52.925
and I hate that lady.

31:52.959 --> 31:56.929
So, no. Negative.

31:56.963 --> 31:58.898
Not happening.

32:03.870 --> 32:08.774
Hey. I found this listing
and it's not too far away.

32:08.808 --> 32:11.810
And there's a washer- dryer,
and a community pool.

32:11.845 --> 32:14.713
Great, thanks.

32:16.716 --> 32:19.885
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Just...

32:24.591 --> 32:26.825
I can't believe both the girls
are gonna be out of the house soon.

32:26.860 --> 32:30.562
Um...

32:30.647 --> 32:31.880
What happened with Wes?

32:31.915 --> 32:35.684
Oh, he invited me to
move to Hawaii with him.

32:35.719 --> 32:37.586
Start a big project.

32:39.522 --> 32:41.623
And you said no?

32:41.658 --> 32:46.328
I came home and found out
what Bay did for Daphne.

32:46.363 --> 32:50.432
It didn't really feel like it was
the best time to jet off to Maui.

32:50.467 --> 32:53.268
"Bye! You guys got this covered, right?

32:53.303 --> 32:57.506
I'm gonna go float around the
islands being Mrs. Wes Gable."

32:59.209 --> 33:01.243
Maybe I should've said yes.

33:01.277 --> 33:03.212
I don't know anymore.

33:03.246 --> 33:04.480
Is the offer still open?

33:04.514 --> 33:06.315
That ship has sailed.

33:08.118 --> 33:13.055
Every decision I have made this past year,

33:13.089 --> 33:15.090
going into business with Wes,

33:15.125 --> 33:17.993
agreeing to work with Chip Coto,

33:18.028 --> 33:22.931
giving Daphne space after Angelo died...

33:22.966 --> 33:25.000
They were all really bad decisions.

33:25.035 --> 33:27.102
That is not fair.

33:27.137 --> 33:29.238
I...

33:29.272 --> 33:32.074
Just feel like I can't
trust myself anymore.

33:32.108 --> 33:33.909
Like I've lost my compass.

33:33.943 --> 33:37.813
We started this arrangement
because of the switch.

33:37.847 --> 33:40.849
But we have moved way beyond that now.

33:40.884 --> 33:42.684
You're family.

33:43.953 --> 33:45.087
Please stay.

33:45.121 --> 33:47.056
(Chuckles)

33:47.090 --> 33:51.960
So you, me, John,

33:51.995 --> 33:53.962
the three of us live here,

33:53.997 --> 33:56.665
and we grow old together?

33:56.699 --> 33:59.701
Maybe.

33:59.736 --> 34:01.904
At least for a little while.

34:01.938 --> 34:04.540
Until you find your compass.

34:06.709 --> 34:08.643
Okay.

34:13.705 --> 34:16.031
_

34:16.632 --> 34:18.252
_

34:18.253 --> 34:21.574
_

34:22.076 --> 34:25.920
_

34:25.920 --> 34:27.270
_

34:27.271 --> 34:33.369
_

34:33.370 --> 34:35.918
_

34:35.918 --> 34:37.123
_

34:37.125 --> 34:39.540
_

34:39.541 --> 34:41.636
_

34:41.637 --> 34:44.184
_

34:44.185 --> 34:47.050
_

34:47.051 --> 34:49.257
_

34:49.259 --> 34:55.630
_

34:55.630 --> 34:57.560
_

34:57.561 --> 34:59.610
_

34:59.611 --> 35:00.900
_

35:11.120 --> 35:12.410
Josh! Wait!

35:12.414 --> 35:13.860
What did I tell you? Not interested.

35:13.894 --> 35:16.462
- I know, but...
- Just find someone else.

35:16.497 --> 35:18.564
No, that's the thing. There is no one else.

35:18.599 --> 35:20.533
Well, I guess that sucks
for you then, doesn't it.

35:20.567 --> 35:22.769
Just stop. Give me one minute. One?

35:26.540 --> 35:30.309
I made a huge mistake last year.

35:31.678 --> 35:34.414
Actually, I made a lot of mistakes,

35:34.448 --> 35:37.316
and it hurt the people

35:37.351 --> 35:40.520
that I really care about.

35:40.554 --> 35:43.356
I'm trying my best to make it up to them.

35:43.390 --> 35:46.292
And right now the only way
to do that is to make sure

35:46.360 --> 35:49.462
that the sacrifice these
people made for me counts.

35:49.496 --> 35:52.198
And that's by taking chem 1?

35:54.334 --> 35:55.368
Yeah.

35:55.402 --> 35:59.272
Josh, you have ears that work

35:59.306 --> 36:02.475
and a brain that
understands thermodynamics.

36:02.509 --> 36:06.212
You have hands that can form bizarre words

36:06.246 --> 36:08.247
at an incredible speed.

36:08.282 --> 36:12.318
I can't believe there's
even one of you in existence.

36:12.352 --> 36:16.088
Please help me.

36:16.123 --> 36:19.258
Plus, don't you want more
deaf doctors in the world

36:19.293 --> 36:22.328
so people like your parents have physicians

36:22.362 --> 36:26.065
they can go to who speak their language?

36:26.099 --> 36:30.036
You're really pullin' on all
the heartstrings, aren't you?

36:31.271 --> 36:33.940
And it pays well.

36:36.276 --> 36:38.144
Fine.

36:38.178 --> 36:41.113
- Really, you will?
- Yeah.

36:41.148 --> 36:44.951
Oh! You are awesome, Josh Padden!

36:44.985 --> 36:46.118
You are awesome!

36:46.153 --> 36:49.755
I'll see you bright and
early on Monday morning!

38:53.347 --> 38:57.183
It's the right decision. I know it.

39:07.961 --> 39:09.895

Hey.

40:09.990 --> 40:11.791
Did Emmett just leave?

40:15.062 --> 40:18.964
I heard what happened. Do
you want to talk about it?

40:20.934 --> 40:22.735
No.

40:24.938 --> 40:27.606
I'm so sorry this turned into such a mess.

40:27.641 --> 40:30.710
Yeah.

40:30.744 --> 40:32.611
That's why I'm not going to Gallaudet.

40:34.581 --> 40:36.816
I know that you didn't ask me to,

40:36.850 --> 40:41.787
it's just the right thing to do. To stay.

40:41.822 --> 40:45.658
You don't get a medal for not going.

40:45.692 --> 40:48.594
I know that.

40:48.628 --> 40:51.597
I just wanted to be around for you,

40:51.631 --> 40:53.599
for whatever you need.

40:53.633 --> 40:56.635
Well, I need you

40:56.670 --> 40:59.605
to not be here right now.

40:59.639 --> 41:02.742
- What?
- I need you to leave my room.

41:04.811 --> 41:07.947
- Bay...
- No. Seriously.
