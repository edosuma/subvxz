00:15.750 --> 00:16.701
Oh, ?god

00:17.200 --> 00:18.868
Oh! Oh, God.

00:18.934 --> 00:22.567
Oh, God.

00:22.634 --> 00:26.300
(moaning)

00:27.200 --> 00:29.234
Oh, God. Oh...

00:29.300 --> 00:32.133
Oh, God. Oh. God.

00:32.659 --> 00:34.133
Oh, God.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.460
I was picturing something
entirely different.

00:38.700 --> 00:39.834
I couldn't sleep.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.801
So you decided to make
your nipples hard?

00:44.228 --> 00:45.501
Oh, the peas. No.

00:45.667 --> 00:47.734
I was heating up
some milk and...

00:48.380 --> 00:49.467
<i>You know, my
nipple is hard.</i>

00:51.200 --> 00:53.100
If you can't sleep,
why don't you just take a pill?

00:53.255 --> 00:54.834
I don't believe in pills.

00:55.270 --> 00:55.834
What about booze?

00:56.440 --> 00:57.300
You believe in booze?

00:57.800 --> 00:59.234
That's not sleeping--
that's passing out.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.834
Pot-ay-to, pot-ah-to.

01:02.250 --> 01:03.300
I just, I have
a lot on my mind.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.766
I don't need
to drug myself.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.267
Okay, in that case
I doknow a great,

01:07.334 --> 01:08.267
all-natural sleep aid.

01:09.050 --> 01:09.400
What's that?

01:09.567 --> 01:11.801
Sex. You should get
yourself some sex.

01:12.050 --> 01:14.100
I'll put you right out.
Charlie.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.534
Look at me. I can hardly
keep my eyes open.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Well, sex is not really
an option at the moment.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
You're telling me you
can't make a fist?

01:21.550 --> 01:22.567
Just leave me alone.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.267
How about exercise?

01:25.550 --> 01:27.734
It's kinda like sex,
but without the condom.

01:28.801 --> 01:30.180
You know,
that's not a s d idea.

01:30.210 --> 01:33.243
Well, you should always
wear a condom.

01:33.580 --> 01:35.000
No, I-I mean the exercise.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.866
I-I could go
for a run on the beach.

01:36.867 --> 01:38.265
Sure, I've seen
people do that.

01:38.266 --> 01:41.266
Usually they have a dog,
but I think that's optional.

01:41.555 --> 01:43.033
Actually, that's a great idea.

01:43.450 --> 01:45.700
Oh, where you gonna get
a dog at this hour.

01:45.890 --> 01:47.366
You really enjoy screwing
with me, don't you?

01:48.100 --> 01:50.633
Well, you don't pay rent.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.100
You know what?

01:52.240 --> 01:53.299
I'm gonna do it.

01:53.300 --> 01:54.734
Pay rent?

01:55.500 --> 01:57.134
No...

01:57.200 --> 01:59.300
I'm gonna jog down
to the pier and back.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.201
Maybe I can burn off
my excess energy.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.200

02:25.650 --> 02:27.333
Burn off the energy.

Oh, , no, no!

03:15.580 --> 03:17.699
The guy you want ran that way!

This is ?last warning.

You don't understand!

03:23.434 --> 03:25.633
Follow me! I'll show you!

03:30.800 --> 03:33.199

03:33.200 --> 03:36.500
Put your han behind your head
and drop to your knees!

03:37.120 --> 03:39.053
No, no, you don't understand.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.729
I just couldn't sleep.

03:40.730 --> 03:42.663
Release the dogs!

No, no, no...No dogs.

Charlie, tell them who I am.

<i>I'm sorry, who are you?</i>

04:31.584 --> 04:32.829
Charlie, if you don't
tell them who I am,

04:32.830 --> 04:34.618
they're gonna take me to jail.

04:34.684 --> 04:37.217
Why do you keep
calling me Charlie?

04:37.600 --> 04:40.084
Sir, is this man
living here or not?

04:40.150 --> 04:42.050
Define "living."

04:42.117 --> 04:44.050
Charlie, swear
on my son's life...

04:44.117 --> 04:45.851
Yeah, he lives here.

04:46.400 --> 04:46.999
I told you.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.649
I've got your badge
numbers. I am gonna write

04:48.650 --> 04:51.299
a scathing
letter to...
Shut up.

04:51.300 --> 04:52.299
Thank you, Officers.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.050
You are a credit

04:54.050 --> 04:55.299
You have
a nice evening.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.918
At least t ls clown
didn't ask if I was Jewish.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.249
So.

05:06.250 --> 05:07.950
How was your run?

05:10.150 --> 05:12.650
* Men. *

05:14.150 --> 05:19.617

05:24.000 --> 05:27.883

05:33.733 --> 05:36.167
Enough... drumming.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.167
Fine.

05:38.233 --> 05:39.399
Bass solo.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.399
* Boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom... *

05:43.000 --> 05:43.532
Come on.

05:43.533 --> 05:45.366
I-I'd like to have
a nice, quiet dinner.

05:45.433 --> 05:47.333
And I'd like you
to be a keno waitress

05:47.399 --> 05:49.199
who can fit her entire
hand in her mouth,

05:49.266 --> 05:51.032
but here you sits

05:52.100 --> 05:53.749
I-I'm sorry,
I'm a little cranky.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.131
I haven't slept in two days.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.134
Why don't you take pill?

05:58.550 --> 05:59.799
He doesn't believe in pills.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.333
How can you not believe in them?

06:01.399 --> 06:02.933
They're on TV all the time.

06:04.802 --> 06:05.899
Let me tell you something, Jake.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.700
Big pharmaceutical companies
want you to think

06:07.766 --> 06:08.766
you can take a pill
for everything.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.132
Can't sleep? Take a pill.

06:10.199 --> 06:11.466
Can't wake up? Take a pill.

06:11.533 --> 06:12.967
Feeling sad? Take a pill.

06:13.032 --> 06:14.867
Can't get it up? Take a pill.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.666
Can't get what up?

06:21.450 --> 06:23.483
Can we just eat
our dinner, please?

06:26.750 --> 06:28.151
Can I got back
to Mom's tomorrow?

06:28.900 --> 06:29.699
Why?

06:29.700 --> 06:30.899
I want to hang out
with my friends.

06:31.000 --> 06:31.866
What? All of a sudden
your father's

06:31.867 --> 06:32.800
not good enough for you?

06:33.750 --> 06:36.882
It's not all of a sudden.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.849
Come on, Alan,
the kid's growing up.

06:39.850 --> 06:41.031
He's got his own life now.

06:41.032 --> 06:41.799
All right, fine.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.300
How about you have your friends
come over here?

06:43.333 --> 06:45.666
<i>Whoa, oa, whoa.</i>

06:46.000 --> 06:47.399
No kids in my house.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.134
I'm a kid.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.299
Well, I don't think of you
as a kid.

06:51.300 --> 06:55.334
I think of you as more of a...
gassy dwarf.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.499
Charlie,

06:58.500 --> 06:59.232
you said it yourself--

07:00.000 --> 07:00.765
he's growing up.

07:00.766 --> 07:02.366
Getting a life of his own.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.565
He'll be going off
to college soon.

07:04.566 --> 07:06.433
I'll only see him on holidays...

07:06.800 --> 07:08.466
only hear from him
when he needs money.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.199
Not that I'll have any.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.500
I'll still be paying alimony
to two ex-wives.

07:13.700 --> 07:14.715
And college tuition?

07:14.750 --> 07:18.483
That just means selling an organ
or turning tricks.

07:20.066 --> 07:21.499
And for what?

07:21.500 --> 07:23.700
So that he can get
a worthless piece of paper

07:23.700 --> 07:25.450
that he can then
fold into a hat

07:25.450 --> 07:26.900
to wear to the fast-food job

07:26.900 --> 07:28.700
that he will probably
be fired from

07:28.700 --> 07:31.700
for stealing fries
from the customers' bags.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.366
I do like fries.

07:40.733 --> 07:42.800
* Men. *

07:51.300 --> 07:54.134
(quietly):
Sure, you can sleep.

07:54.201 --> 07:56.366
You have no conscience.

07:57.633 --> 07:58.700
Wake up!

08:03.366 --> 08:04.499
What?

08:04.500 --> 08:05.834
It's noon.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.799
What day?

08:07.800 --> 08:08.933
Saturday.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.267
Thanks. See you Sunday.

08:11.834 --> 08:13.599
Charlie, I have to go out.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.800
I need you to watch
Jake and his friend.

08:16.233 --> 08:17.233
Friend?

08:17.300 --> 08:18.699
I thought I said no kids.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.099
You say lots
of stuff.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.966
Twice a week you say
you'll never drink again.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.266
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

08:26.333 --> 08:27.699
Where are you going?

08:27.700 --> 08:29.166
I'm gonna have
to run some errands.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.199
So take the kids with you.

08:30.200 --> 08:30.699
I can't.

08:30.700 --> 08:31.734
Then run your errands later.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.066
Oh, would you
please just get

08:33.067 --> 08:34.650
your drunken ass
out of bed

08:34.650 --> 08:38.549
and stop being a waste of
skin for once in your life?!

08:42.000 --> 08:43.700
Well, ?can't you say please

08:45.567 --> 08:46.934
Thank you.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.300
I'm, I'm sorry I barked at you.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.499
You still can't sleep, huh?

08:52.500 --> 08:54.233
No.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.499
Well, don't worry,
I'm here for you.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.299
I'll keep an eye
on the kids.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.299
I appreciate it.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.533
No problem.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.867
It's like he's never met me.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.332
Nothing seems to work.

09:16.333 --> 09:19.199
I-I've tried
warm milk, exercise,

09:19.200 --> 09:21.134
meditation, self-hypnosis.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.067
Why don't you just take a pill?

09:24.400 --> 09:25.899
Because I don't need a pill.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.300
The root of my insomnia
is psychological.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.949
That is why I'm sitting here
with you, a psychologist.

09:30.950 --> 09:33.499
I'm a psychiatrist,
a medical doctor,

09:33.500 --> 09:36.017
which is why
I can prescribe pills.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.044
Is that some kind of shot at me

09:37.045 --> 09:38.783
because I'm just
a chiropractor?

09:38.850 --> 09:40.199
No, of course t,

09:40.200 --> 09:42.483
<i>but I am a real doctor.</i>

09:43.600 --> 09:44.999
Look, can you help me or not?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.150
You know,
delve into my subconscious

09:47.200 --> 09:48.799
and unravel the source
of my problem?

09:48.800 --> 09:51.683
Sure, I'll give it a shot.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.883
So, when was the last time
you had sex?

09:53.950 --> 09:56.249
This has nothing to do with sex!

09:56.316 --> 09:59.249
This has to do with alimony
and ex-wives and child support

09:59.316 --> 10:01.216
an-and writing check
I can't cover

10:01.282 --> 10:03.282
and having to live on my
brother's freaking hide-a-bed.

10:03.349 --> 10:05.316
Okay, why don't we start
with your brother?

10:05.383 --> 10:06.783
What does my brother
have to do with this?

10:06.850 --> 10:08.083
Who's the doctor here?

10:08.149 --> 10:09.416
Okay, that was a shot.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.549
You got me.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.750
Now tell me about your brother.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.499
What is there to say? Um...

10:17.500 --> 10:21.000
He's two years older than me,
but much more immature.

10:21.416 --> 10:23.200
He's charming and easygoing.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.449
Of course, why shouldn't he be?

10:24.516 --> 10:26.999
He's never had to work for
anything in his entire life.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.883
Money and women
just seem to fall

10:28.950 --> 10:32.216
into his big, fat, lucky lap.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.315
So you resent him.

10:34.316 --> 10:35.916
Oh, no, I love him.
He took me in

10:35.983 --> 10:37.216
when I needed
a place to live.

10:37.282 --> 10:39.483
Okay. You say
you love your brother,

10:39.549 --> 10:40.749
you're grateful for his help,

10:40.750 --> 10:44.080
and yet it must be difficult
to watch him sail through life

10:44.080 --> 10:48.117
while you remain a complete
and utter failure.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.316
I didn't say I was
a complete failure.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.316
Huh.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.750
Why is it in my notes?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.916
Anyway,continue.

10:59.650 --> 11:00.883
Okay.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.649
Well, the worst part is

11:03.650 --> 11:06.549
that as selfish and promiscuous
as Charlie is,

11:06.900 --> 11:08.833
he hasn't suffered
any consequences.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.950
No palimony suits, no bullet
wounds from angry husbands.

11:13.900 --> 11:17.483
Not so much as a lousy
urinary tract infection.

11:17.950 --> 11:19.117
And yet you love him.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.349
Well, he's family.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.249
Oh... Oh, I get it.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.200
You think it's this
internal contradiction

11:28.200 --> 11:29.700
that's the source
of my insomnia.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.750
What do you think?

11:31.600 --> 11:33.216
I think you may be right.

11:33.700 --> 11:34.783
But how do I resolve it?

11:35.300 --> 11:36.299
Well, that's a good question.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.200
?but? Unfortunately,
we're out of time.

11:38.800 --> 11:39.383
Already?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.950
You dozed off for
40 minutes, Alan.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.549
You going to charge me for that?

11:44.280 --> 11:45.750
I was awake.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.650
All right, fine.
Can I write you a check?

11:50.200 --> 11:51.316
Oh, boy.

11:51.650 --> 11:53.900
Alan, you know, when a patient
tells me they're writing checks

11:53.916 --> 11:57.950
they can't cover, I kind of have
a little cash only policy.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.900
All right,
where's the closest ATM?

12:01.950 --> 12:03.599
Downstairs in the lobby.

12:03.650 --> 12:04.400
I'll be right back.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.483
I'll walk with you.

12:08.649 --> 12:09.683
* Men. *

12:10.900 --> 12:12.100
(computer chimes)

12:15.680 --> 12:18.745
(chuckles)

12:18.812 --> 12:20.712
(computer chimes)

12:20.779 --> 12:22.712
(chuckles)

12:25.479 --> 12:26.779
(computer chimes)

12:26.845 --> 12:28.779
(chuckles)

12:29.845 --> 12:31.199
Hey.

12:31.200 --> 12:31.799
What you doing?

12:31.900 --> 12:33.349
Chatting.

12:33.350 --> 12:34.283
With who?

12:34.350 --> 12:35.199
Each other.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.016
But you're in the same room.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.283
(computer chimes)
(laughing)

12:42.000 --> 12:43.750
What are you typing?
Is that about me?

12:44.817 --> 12:45.817
No.

12:45.882 --> 12:47.616
(computer chimes)

12:48.000 --> 12:49.483
Down the hall on the right.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.199
BRB.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.499
"BRB"?

12:56.500 --> 12:57.782
"Be right back."

12:57.950 --> 12:59.416
Ah.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.600
Well... YAD.

13:02.650 --> 13:03.582
What's that?

13:03.583 --> 13:05.516
You're a dog.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.167
She's cute.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.200
She's just a friend.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.782
R-R-R-uff.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.299
What are you doing?

13:15.300 --> 13:17.598
Oh, come on, it's me
you're talking to.

13:17.599 --> 13:18.649
The big dog.

13:18.650 --> 13:21.016
(howling)

13:21.800 --> 13:23.900
?ok,ok!?
You're starting
to freak me out.

13:24.350 --> 13:25.600
(doorbell rings)

13:25.600 --> 13:27.100
GIRL:
That's my mom.

13:27.350 --> 13:28.379
I'll get it.

13:28.380 --> 13:30.280
Okay, okay, I lied--
I like her.

13:31.000 --> 13:31.614
Oh, really?

13:32.150 --> 13:35.433
Yeah. Woof.

13:35.700 --> 13:36.750
There you go.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.366
Wait, don't open the door.

13:39.667 --> 13:40.799
Why not?
(doorbell ringing)

13:40.800 --> 13:41.899
Coming.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.799
Go to your room.

13:43.800 --> 13:44.800
What are you nuts?

13:45.300 --> 13:46.467
Please don't hit on her.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.799
Hit on who?

13:47.800 --> 13:49.066
Taylor's mom.

13:49.067 --> 13:50.668
Why would I hit
on Taylor's mom?

13:51.000 --> 13:51.999
Well, because
she's kind of pretty,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.799
and you'll hit on
anything with a pulse.

13:55.850 --> 13:56.900
Where'd you get that?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.099
My mom.

13:58.100 --> 13:58.749
Oh, well...

13:58.750 --> 14:01.849
And my dad, Berta,
Rose, Grandma...

14:01.850 --> 14:02.949
Okay, okay.

14:03.180 --> 14:04.249
The UPS man...

14:04.250 --> 14:05.716
All right.

14:05.783 --> 14:07.050
And when you hit on
people I know,

14:07.117 --> 14:08.350
everything gets screwed up

14:08.416 --> 14:10.183
where I have to find
a new guitar teacher,

14:10.250 --> 14:12.000
a new karate class,
Cub Scout troop...

14:12.300 --> 14:13.599
Okay, okay, I get it.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.834
...godmother.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.499
You don't have
to worry.

14:16.500 --> 14:19.533
I'm not going to risk
our friendship over
"kind of pretty."

14:19.550 --> 14:20.934
So you won't
hit on her?

14:20.999 --> 14:22.633
Absolutely not.

14:24.867 --> 14:27.533
Hi. I'm Taylor's mom.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.157
???????

14:34.850 --> 14:36.099
??ok!i will give you a call~

14:36.100 --> 14:37.700
Great. Bye.

14:45.150 --> 14:46.699
You promised.

14:46.700 --> 14:49.399
?i know i know. The head
that made the promise

14:49.400 --> 14:51.300
is not the one that broke it.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.799
And besides, you said she
was just kind of pretty?

14:56.800 --> 14:58.133
Who do you
consider hot?

14:58.500 --> 14:59.800
Taylor.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.349
Taylor's 12.

15:01.350 --> 15:03.450
Hello?

15:04.200 --> 15:06.032
Come on, what's the worst thing
that could happen

15:06.033 --> 15:07.799
if I go out with your
little friend's mom?

15:07.800 --> 15:09.600
Do I have to explain
it to you again?

15:09.800 --> 15:11.800
My guitar teacher,
my karate coach...

15:11.850 --> 15:12.779
Okay, okay.

15:12.780 --> 15:15.714
I can't show my face
at the comic book store

15:16.399 --> 15:19.349
All right, but the worst thing
doesn't have to happen.

15:19.350 --> 15:22.050
Would you please just
not go out with her?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.279
Tell you what--
I'll make you a deal.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.399
I'll give up Taylor's mom
in exchange

15:27.400 --> 15:30.001
for you washing my car
once a week for the next month.

15:30.267 --> 15:30.799
Done.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.400
That includes Turtle Wax,
tire dressing

15:32.400 --> 15:34.700
and vacuuming the carpets.
Oh, man.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.699
Hey, hey, hey, hey, the woman
is recently divorced.

15:36.766 --> 15:38.532
I didn't ask for her number,
she gave it to me.

15:38.599 --> 15:40.267
Do you know what that means?
No.

15:40.333 --> 15:43.466
That means onemaybe two
dinners, and...

15:45.966 --> 15:47.100
You're waxing my car.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.900
All right.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.200
You're lucky you're not
painting the house.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.300
The saifices we make
for our kids.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.150
Hey.

15:59.216 --> 16:00.749
Hey.

16:00.750 --> 16:01.883
You look like crap.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.279
Thank you.
You look terrific.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.570
I feel terrific.

16:05.571 --> 16:07.169
The key is a good night's sleep.

16:08.200 --> 16:08.738
Yeah, listen, uh,

16:09.250 --> 16:11.149
I have to talk to you.

16:11.150 --> 16:13.382
This is a bad
time, Alan.
How come?

16:13.383 --> 16:14.983
Because you want
to talk to me.

16:16.770 --> 16:17.783
Okay, what?

16:18.270 --> 16:20.116
Uh, you know I love you, right?

16:20.777 --> 16:23.283
Alan, are you
breaking up with me?

16:23.538 --> 16:26.049
Would you just shut up
and listen to me?

16:26.050 --> 16:28.171
Pick o, Alan.

16:28.650 --> 16:31.449
All right, all right,
I talked to a therapist.

16:31.450 --> 16:35.617
And I think
I learned something.

16:36.450 --> 16:39.016
Nah, too easy.
Go ahead.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.799
The thing is...

16:40.800 --> 16:43.834
all these years of watching
your life go so smoothly,

16:43.900 --> 16:45.600
while I stumble back and forth

16:45.667 --> 16:48.266
between humiliation
and abject failure,

16:48.333 --> 16:50.867
has resulted in me harboring
a lot of anger

16:50.934 --> 16:52.266
and jealousy towards you.

16:52.333 --> 16:53.633
ah, I get that.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.799
How could it not?

16:57.800 --> 17:01.000
Anyway, I think the tension
between my love for you

17:01.000 --> 17:04.800
and my resentment of you
is what's causing my insomnia.

17:05.000 --> 17:05.799
And?

17:05.800 --> 17:07.777
And I thought maybe if
I got it out in the open,

17:07.777 --> 17:08.777
it might help me sleep.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.480
So how do you feel now?

17:11.900 --> 17:13.098
Better, actually.

17:13.550 --> 17:16.098
Like... like a weight
has been lifted.

17:16.099 --> 17:16.766
Well, good.

17:16.767 --> 17:18.165
Yeah, maybe that's it.

17:18.233 --> 17:19.800
Maybe all I needed to do
was unload.

17:20.867 --> 17:24.134
Well, a good unloading
usually makes me drowsy.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.299
You're disgusting.

17:26.000 --> 17:26.999
True...

17:27.000 --> 17:29.466
but I sleep
like a baby.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.333
And if I wake up fussy,

17:31.400 --> 17:34.100
there's always something
nearby to put in my mouth.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.067
* Men. *

17:39.134 --> 17:41.134
(whistling tune)

17:56.480 --> 17:59.900
I waxed your car.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.878
What? What are you doing up?

18:02.879 --> 18:04.949
You were out with Taylor's mom,
weren't you?

18:04.950 --> 18:06.316
No, I wasn't.

18:06.317 --> 18:07.482
Are you sure?

18:07.800 --> 18:09.582
I think I know
who I was out with.

18:09.599 --> 18:12.116
Okay, well, maybe you
can explain this picture

18:12.183 --> 18:14.983
of your perfectlwaxed
car in Taylor's driveway.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.199
Where the hell'd you get that?

18:16.200 --> 18:18.849
Taylor took it with her phone
and e-mailed it to me.

18:18.850 --> 18:21.167
Oh, okay.

18:21.650 --> 18:23.434
Not my car.

18:24.350 --> 18:25.234
What about this one of you

18:25.300 --> 18:27.167
kissing Taylor's mom
in front of the car?

18:29.135 --> 18:30.934
Um...

18:31.001 --> 18:32.167
Photoshop.

18:33.634 --> 18:34.668
How was your date?

18:35.400 --> 18:36.399
Very nice.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.334
Bite me.

18:40.550 --> 18:41.768
Okay, well, good night.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.934
You said you wouldn't
go out with r and you did.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.101
I had to, Jake.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.234
She called me.

18:47.550 --> 18:49.050
What difference does that make?

18:49.050 --> 18:50.800
I have to explain it to you?

18:50.800 --> 18:53.035
I have to explain
everything to you.

18:54.280 --> 18:55.267
Okay, okay.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.701
Let's say you're a hunter.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.367
If a deer takes your gun,
shoots itself,

19:01.850 --> 19:04.834
then straps itself
to the roof of your car,

19:05.550 --> 19:08.001
you have to take it home
and eat it.

19:09.550 --> 19:10.801
What?

19:11.600 --> 19:12.400
I'm sorry.

19:12.434 --> 19:14.601
I can't make it any clearer.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.000
If you keep seeing her, Uncle
Charlie, you' gonna be sorry.

19:19.010 --> 19:20.000
Whoa.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Is that a threat?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.167
No, it's a promise.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
What's the difference?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.634
I don't know-- one's a threat
and one's a promise.

19:27.601 --> 19:28.901
(sighs)

19:29.800 --> 19:31.740
Oh, come on, buddy,
let's be reasonable here.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.634
Your relationship with
your little friend is what,

19:33.851 --> 19:36.850
instant messaging and holding
hands at the pep rally?

19:36.850 --> 19:38.135
What's a pep rally?

19:38.770 --> 19:39.768
Just listen to me.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.434
Before you know it, you'll have
forgotten all about Taylor.

19:42.950 --> 19:44.800
And you'll have forgotten
all about her mother.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.401
No doubt.

19:46.770 --> 19:49.250
But I guarantee you
I'll be forgetting a lot more

19:49.250 --> 19:51.250
than holding her hand
at a pep rally.

19:52.001 --> 19:52.968
Last chance, Uncle Charlie.

19:54.700 --> 19:57.035
Ooh, I'm so scared.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.834
(mocking):
Last chance, Uncle Charlie.

20:00.901 --> 20:02.968
(scoffs)
Please.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.534
CHARLIE:
Jake...!

20:14.850 --> 20:15.499
What's going on?

20:15.500 --> 20:16.266
Nothing.
Got to go.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.499
You're dead.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.286
You are so dead!

20:21.100 --> 20:21.700
(screams)

20:21.701 --> 20:23.101
(thud)

20:24.834 --> 20:26.101
Damn it.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.800
He went that way.

20:39.100 --> 20:41.800
Great slime.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.466
Thanks ?a lot

20:44.200 --> 20:47.367
?thanks...?It's an old family recipe.

20:49.250 --> 20:52.799
Where are you, you rat bastard?!

20:52.800 --> 20:54.800
MAN (over speaker):?come on man?
This is the Los Angeles
Sheriff's Department!

20:54.800 --> 20:57.633
Get down on the sand
