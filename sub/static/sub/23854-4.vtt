CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:23.790 --> 00:27.070
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.
Let's play

00:27.070 --> 00:29.790
who forgot to sign the producer's
birthday card?

00:29.790 --> 00:33.750
Here's a clue. On tonight's show I
drive one of the fastest cars of all

00:33.750 --> 00:38.070
time, Chris drives one of the most
iconic cars of all time,

00:38.070 --> 00:40.430
and Rory drives a Kia.

00:40.430 --> 00:42.230
LAUGHTER

00:42.230 --> 00:45.710
- All you had to do was sign your
name, Rory. - Yeah. I know.

00:45.710 --> 00:48.030
- Thanks. - That was literally
all you had to do.

00:48.030 --> 00:51.830
- I know! - Now, we all know the car
world is full of outrageous claims.

00:51.830 --> 00:55.390
For example, Chris Harris still
insists he's five foot eight.

00:55.390 --> 00:58.670
- He isn't. - Well, you're not five foot
ten, are you?

01:07.390 --> 01:11.710
All right. Now, here's another
outrageous claim from Dodge.

01:11.710 --> 01:16.270
Dodge says it's built a car
that will outrun anything on

01:16.270 --> 01:18.070
the planet. Like these.

01:18.070 --> 01:20.270
HE SNIGGERS

01:20.270 --> 01:23.830
And, apparently, you can buy
this fastest car

01:23.830 --> 01:25.670
in the world for 84,995,

01:25.670 --> 01:27.910
that's about Â£60,000.

01:27.910 --> 01:29.470
I'm five foot ten, Chris!

01:41.350 --> 01:42.550
It's called the Demon...

01:44.510 --> 01:47.830
..and, as you can see, it doesn't
look like a supercar.

01:47.830 --> 01:50.550
It looks like a muscle car.

01:50.550 --> 01:53.150
A muscle car with
a muscle car motor.

01:55.510 --> 01:57.030
ENGINE ROARS AND RASPS

01:57.030 --> 02:02.150
A big, noisy, 6.2 litre V8
with a big, noisy,

02:02.150 --> 02:04.350
supercharger strapped to the top.

02:04.350 --> 02:08.430
In fact, the biggest supercharger
ever found on a production car.

02:08.430 --> 02:09.949
SUPERCHARGER WHIRS

02:09.949 --> 02:12.790
Oh, yeah! Listen to it scream!

02:14.470 --> 02:17.870
It sounds like Satan
passing a kidney stone.

02:19.430 --> 02:22.110
That might be the most addictive
throttle pedal

02:22.110 --> 02:23.590
I have ever experienced.

02:27.110 --> 02:31.150
And, as you'd expect from a car
that's limited to 168mph...

02:32.510 --> 02:35.790
..out on the road, the Demon
does feel pretty fast.

02:39.190 --> 02:42.310
But supercar fast? Hyper car fast?

02:42.310 --> 02:43.470
I don't know.

02:44.830 --> 02:47.270
You know, this isn't
some stripped down sports car,

02:47.270 --> 02:50.190
this is a big, comfy cruiser.

02:50.190 --> 02:53.510
Two metric tons of big,
comfy cruiser, to be precise.

02:55.550 --> 02:59.510
There's no hybrid, energy recovery
gizmo, there's just a big motor.

03:01.630 --> 03:05.110
And there's no supercar spec,
double-clutch gearbox.

03:05.110 --> 03:06.510
It's just a big automatic.

03:08.630 --> 03:11.630
To be honest, it's kind of
just a Dodge.

03:11.630 --> 03:14.950
But I've got to say, I've driven
quite a few Dodges over the years,

03:14.950 --> 03:16.550
and they're not my favourite.

03:16.550 --> 03:19.870
The interiors are very plastic
and cheap feeling.

03:22.910 --> 03:25.830
And, while it's no supercar
on the inside,

03:25.830 --> 03:27.350
it doesn't corner like one either.

03:31.030 --> 03:32.070
Oh!

03:33.350 --> 03:36.990
If you try to go around this corner
in the Demon as fast as you go

03:36.990 --> 03:40.150
around this corner in the LaFerrari,
you wouldn't go around that corner.

03:41.350 --> 03:42.710
On a road like this,

03:42.710 --> 03:45.670
the Demon just would not see
which way a supercar went.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.910
It pains me to say it,
but it's true.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.910
So, there you go, question answered.

03:53.790 --> 03:57.310
For 84,995,

03:57.310 --> 04:01.110
you can't buy a car that will
outrun anything else on the planet.

04:01.110 --> 04:08.510
However, for 84,996,
you might just be able to.

04:13.390 --> 04:15.470
Because, when you buy a Demon,

04:15.470 --> 04:19.589
Dodge will also give you the option
to spend 1 more

04:19.589 --> 04:21.310
on a crate of stuff.

04:21.310 --> 04:22.510
OK!

04:22.510 --> 04:30.510
You get tools, skinny front tyres,
a high-flow air filter, a new ECU.

04:30.510 --> 04:32.310
Loads of cool stuff.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.990
Because Dodge didn't build the Demon
to go quick on a winding,

04:36.990 --> 04:40.270
alpine pass or a tight street
circuit. No, no.

04:40.270 --> 04:42.670
The Demon was made to do one thing.

04:42.670 --> 04:45.590
To tear up the drag strip,
a quarter-mile at a time.

04:47.590 --> 04:51.310
Bolt all those crate parts on,
feed it some decent fuel,

04:51.310 --> 04:54.990
and it will give you 840 horsepower.

04:56.190 --> 05:00.870
This is the most powerful V8
production car in history.

05:02.310 --> 05:05.470
Dodge says this car will run
the standing quarter mile

05:05.470 --> 05:07.190
in 9.65 seconds,

05:07.190 --> 05:12.310
which, if you know your drag racing,
you'll know is really, really fast.

05:12.310 --> 05:15.470
But if you don't know your drag
racing, here's how it works.

05:19.630 --> 05:21.710
First, you need to warm the tyres.

05:25.710 --> 05:28.910
The Demon has a function called line
lock, which brakes the front wheels,

05:28.910 --> 05:31.310
so you can spin up the rears.

05:31.310 --> 05:33.670
ALARM DINGS
Oh, they're done.

05:35.350 --> 05:37.990
And, once you've warmed the tyres,
you're ready to go.

05:39.790 --> 05:41.630
Well, almost.

05:41.630 --> 05:44.470
OK, so, to launch this thing
is pretty easy.

05:44.470 --> 05:49.270
Left foot on the break, hold in
both these paddles, add some revs,

05:49.270 --> 05:53.790
release one paddle,
foot off the brake,

05:53.790 --> 05:56.550
release the other paddle
as you bury the throttle.

05:56.550 --> 05:57.590
See, easy.

06:03.910 --> 06:05.150
Jesus Christ!

06:06.510 --> 06:08.310
That is incredible!

06:17.710 --> 06:20.110
That won't get old, ever.

06:21.190 --> 06:24.230
You literally could not fall off
a cliff faster than that.

06:26.670 --> 06:28.390
Oh, hell, I'm doing that again.

06:30.430 --> 06:32.270
And you can.

06:33.990 --> 06:37.230
Because, unlike most cars
with launch control,

06:37.230 --> 06:39.270
where you do a couple
of full-bore starts,

06:39.270 --> 06:41.990
and then it has to go and lie down
for a bit...

06:43.630 --> 06:45.710
..in making the Demon,

06:45.710 --> 06:50.310
Dodge had one do over 5,000 launches
without a single glitch.

06:55.630 --> 06:57.350
That is addictive.

06:57.350 --> 07:01.750
OK. Now that I'm warmed up,
how about a little race, huh?

07:05.670 --> 07:11.630
That is a Lamborghini Aventador,
four-wheel drive, V12 engine,

07:11.630 --> 07:13.870
four times the price of the Demon.

07:17.310 --> 07:18.550
Let's do this.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.470
I've just roasted that Lambo!

07:34.750 --> 07:39.150
Damn! That is big American balls,
baby!

07:39.150 --> 07:41.990
Big, fat, American ice cubes.

07:41.990 --> 07:44.790
Is that a Lamborghini
way back there?

07:44.790 --> 07:46.390
I think it is!

07:49.190 --> 07:51.390
When you hook everything up right,

07:51.390 --> 07:54.230
you know how fast this car
does zero to 60?

07:54.230 --> 07:56.550
2.3 seconds.

07:56.550 --> 08:01.390
This is the fastest accelerating
road car in history.

08:02.990 --> 08:07.030
So, there you go, if you're the kind
of person who wants to live life

08:07.030 --> 08:08.550
a quarter mile at a time,

08:08.550 --> 08:11.710
you don't want a couple of
hundred grand supercar,

08:11.710 --> 08:13.270
you want a Demon.

08:13.270 --> 08:17.110
And if you think driving very fast
in a straight line

08:17.110 --> 08:18.590
is a bit pointless,

08:18.590 --> 08:23.670
you'd be wrong. Because the Demon's
very specific set of skills makes it

08:23.670 --> 08:27.430
the ultimate candidate for the
coolest job in the world.

08:29.830 --> 08:33.270
Back in the '50s,
in the depths of the Cold War,

08:33.270 --> 08:36.150
America launched the Lockheed U-2.

08:36.150 --> 08:38.870
Designed to cruise at 70,000 feet,

08:38.870 --> 08:41.990
twice the altitude of a
commercial jet,

08:41.990 --> 08:44.590
it was the ultimate spy plane.

08:44.590 --> 08:48.150
But, with its vast wingspan,
poor visibility,

08:48.150 --> 08:53.670
and lack of proper landing gear,
it was a pig to land.

08:53.670 --> 08:56.230
In fact, the military found
the only safe way

08:56.230 --> 08:57.830
to bring the U-2 down was to

08:57.830 --> 09:01.310
have a radio spotter chase it down
the runway, in a car.

09:02.990 --> 09:05.670
And because the U-2 comes in at
over 100mph,

09:05.670 --> 09:08.830
that meant using a muscle car.

09:08.830 --> 09:10.750
Zoom, zoom.

09:10.750 --> 09:14.430
60 years later, the U-2 has been
redesigned,

09:14.430 --> 09:19.110
and modified in the name of
environmental science, by Nasa.

09:19.110 --> 09:24.550
It's now known as the ER-2,
and it is still a pig to land.

09:24.550 --> 09:27.470
And that's where me and the Demon
come in.

09:27.470 --> 09:30.870
What better way to land the world's
hardest-to-land aeroplane

09:30.870 --> 09:33.150
than with the world's
fastest-accelerating car?

09:34.510 --> 09:36.310
Only one way to find out.

09:37.630 --> 09:41.590
So, with the ER-2 taking off on an
eight-hour mission to research

09:41.590 --> 09:44.750
volcanoes and glaciers and stuff,

09:44.750 --> 09:48.110
I was sent for a briefing
with Nasa pilot Dean Neeley.

09:48.110 --> 09:50.190
Call sign, Gucci,

09:50.190 --> 09:52.430
who did nothing to settle my nerves.

09:52.430 --> 09:53.950
When he goes up there today,

09:53.950 --> 09:57.150
he's going to be the highest man in
the world, off for hours and hours,

09:57.150 --> 10:01.590
flying 13 miles above the earth, and
coming back, exhausted, dehydrated,

10:01.590 --> 10:04.790
in an aeroplane that's really like
landing a motorcycle coming off of

10:04.790 --> 10:09.470
a jump. So, we've got to always be
ready to expect the unexpected.

10:09.470 --> 10:10.510
All right, next slide.

10:11.790 --> 10:15.710
OK, we're going to do our primary
duty, which is being visible to him,

10:15.710 --> 10:19.150
where we roll in behind him and get
in position to feed him

10:19.150 --> 10:20.390
useful information.

10:20.390 --> 10:23.110
And, then, as you're accelerating
straight ahead, toward him,

10:23.110 --> 10:25.190
fade in right behind his
six o'clock position,

10:25.190 --> 10:26.950
looking right down the tailpipe.

10:26.950 --> 10:29.390
What Dean was very thoroughly
suggesting

10:29.390 --> 10:33.270
was that I accelerate onto the
runway at 140mph,

10:33.270 --> 10:36.990
right up behind the ER-2's
jet engine exhaust,

10:36.990 --> 10:39.230
while talking the pilot down
over the radio.

10:40.470 --> 10:42.550
Piece of cake.

10:42.550 --> 10:46.190
Eight, six, four, two...

10:46.190 --> 10:47.710
..two, two...

10:48.830 --> 10:51.630
..one. The only thing that we can
fail at today

10:51.630 --> 10:53.310
is hit the main gear first,

10:53.310 --> 10:56.550
because he'll skip back into
the air. And he'll stall.

10:56.550 --> 10:59.270
And then you get the cartwheel
manoeuvre, and it's ugly.

10:59.270 --> 11:00.310
Yeah.

11:02.870 --> 11:06.590
So, with the pilot now hard at work
on the edge of space,

11:06.590 --> 11:10.750
and still not 100% clear on what
I was supposed to do,

11:10.750 --> 11:14.550
Dean set up some practice runs,
where, instead of the plane,

11:14.550 --> 11:16.470
we'd be chasing down a car.

11:19.630 --> 11:23.190
You never know, he may come down
fine, and it would be no issue,

11:23.190 --> 11:26.390
or he may do some manoeuvre
that kind of surprises you.

11:26.390 --> 11:28.430
He's going to count on your
immediate response

11:28.430 --> 11:30.350
to guide him back where he
needs to be.

11:30.350 --> 11:32.310
So, that's the critical
part of this.

11:33.430 --> 11:36.230
And with time running out on
the ER-2's mission,

11:36.230 --> 11:38.150
the pressure was on to get it right.

11:39.430 --> 11:41.270
Meet, Gucci, hit it.

11:46.390 --> 11:48.110
There you go, go get him.

11:58.070 --> 12:00.750
OK. You're on your own,
you're on your own.

12:02.750 --> 12:05.350
It's tricky to get out there
that quick.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.590
What was becoming obvious was that
to land the ER-2,

12:08.590 --> 12:13.230
the drag strip-honed Demon
would have to corner at speed.

12:13.230 --> 12:14.950
OK.

12:14.950 --> 12:16.510
This was going to take practice.

12:31.670 --> 12:32.990
Let's try that again.

12:32.990 --> 12:35.350
Nice job, Meet, how about one more,
same thing?

12:42.630 --> 12:44.910
Oh, that's a lot of power, OK.

12:44.910 --> 12:48.350
I was just starting to wrestle
the Demon into line...

12:51.310 --> 12:54.430
..when all too soon,
the call came in.

12:54.430 --> 12:56.750
The ER-2 was making its descent.

13:00.270 --> 13:02.550
Remember, the whole goal is for you
to be in position,

13:02.550 --> 13:04.470
where you can give him good
instructions.

13:04.470 --> 13:06.670
So, it's pretty much now or never.

13:06.670 --> 13:10.030
OK, so this guy's life is in my
hands for about 30 seconds.

13:10.030 --> 13:11.110
- Right? - That's right.

13:14.430 --> 13:20.110
SA-06, runway 22, wing 240,
vector 1-5, cleared to land.

13:21.470 --> 13:23.270
Nasa Mobile, cleared to follow.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.670
Here we go.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.870
About 20 seconds until we go.

13:33.750 --> 13:35.190
ENGINE REVS

13:40.830 --> 13:42.590
Three, two, one...

13:42.590 --> 13:45.110
..hit it.

13:50.510 --> 13:52.310
Get in there.

13:55.470 --> 13:57.590
- 15... - Get it, you're losing it.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.070
OK, eight...

14:12.110 --> 14:14.230
..four...

14:14.230 --> 14:15.870
..four...

14:17.870 --> 14:19.750
..four...

14:19.750 --> 14:22.790
..two, two..

14:22.790 --> 14:24.390
..two...

14:28.590 --> 14:30.710
..and down.
Nice job. Nice job!

14:33.790 --> 14:34.830
Good landing.

14:36.270 --> 14:39.950
- That is good stuff. - That's exactly
what you needed to do.

14:39.950 --> 14:41.110
It's huge.

14:44.070 --> 14:47.150
Gucci, do you recommend we hire him
with additional training?

14:47.150 --> 14:48.870
All right, man. I think you got it.

14:50.270 --> 14:56.110
The Dodge Demon, the 85-grand,
undisputed king of the drag strip.

14:56.110 --> 14:59.630
And now proven at Nasa.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.110
- A mega car.
- Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

15:08.350 --> 15:09.830
That looked pretty intense.

15:11.630 --> 15:13.430
Honestly, were you scared?

15:13.430 --> 15:16.910
Well, come on, your country comes
calling, you answer the call.

15:16.910 --> 15:20.870
Land a Nasa plane, take down
a few bad guys, whatever.

15:20.870 --> 15:23.470
- Terrified, then. - Yeah, I've never
been more scared in my life!

15:24.470 --> 15:26.790
And, plus, if I didn't get the guy
down alive,

15:26.790 --> 15:30.110
the wine and cheese thing with his
family would have been awkward.

15:30.110 --> 15:32.510
Yeah, but at least you didn't crash
the Nasa spy plane.

15:32.510 --> 15:36.510
Yeah, OK, Chris, Nasa was very
clear, it is not a spy plane.

15:36.510 --> 15:38.190
Right, because if you've got
a spy plane,

15:38.190 --> 15:41.230
that's the one thing you don't call
it, isn't it, a spy plane?

15:43.070 --> 15:44.870
It's a research plane.

15:44.870 --> 15:47.990
Research is a polite word
for spying, you know that.

15:47.990 --> 15:51.510
OK, all right, I'm sorry, can we
please talk about the Dodge Demon?

15:51.510 --> 15:55.270
- OK. - 85,000, Â£60,000,
for a car that's faster than

15:55.270 --> 15:57.310
a Lamborghini Aventador.

15:57.310 --> 16:01.470
Yeah, in a straight line.
Yeah, it does, literally, one thing.

16:01.470 --> 16:03.270
What's wrong with doing one thing?

16:03.270 --> 16:07.870
Did anyone care if Neil Armstrong
was a good salsa dancer?

16:07.870 --> 16:10.270
No. We wanted him focused on
the moon stuff.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.030
It's a one trick pony, the Demon.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.430
So what? So what?

16:13.430 --> 16:17.310
You show me a pony that can do
zero to 60 in 2.3 seconds,

16:17.310 --> 16:18.870
and I will buy that pony.

16:18.870 --> 16:20.390
Rory.

16:20.390 --> 16:23.910
Now, it's time to talk
South Korean cars

16:23.910 --> 16:25.950
because they are
taking over Britain.

16:25.950 --> 16:31.310
Last year, Hyundai and Kia sold
nearly 200,000 cars over here,

16:31.310 --> 16:32.630
and no-one even noticed.

16:32.630 --> 16:36.830
Because all South Korean cars
are really, really boring.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.470
Well, nearly all...

16:44.270 --> 16:46.310
Now, this is a surprise.

16:48.310 --> 16:51.950
South Korea has made
a rear-wheel-drive performance car.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.790
It comes from Kia,
and it's called...

16:56.790 --> 16:58.270
..the Stinger.

17:06.670 --> 17:08.990
Terrible name, serious car.

17:10.430 --> 17:14.990
365 horsepower of serious car.

17:17.270 --> 17:21.310
The Stinger will do zero to 60
in under five seconds.

17:21.310 --> 17:24.430
80, 90, 100.

17:25.869 --> 17:27.310
HE YELLS

17:34.230 --> 17:37.070
Flat out, it will do 168mph.

17:38.950 --> 17:41.390
It's the fastest Kia ever.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.750
OK, that's not really that
impressive a boast,

17:45.750 --> 17:46.830
when you think about it,

17:46.830 --> 17:49.110
but you can only beat
what's put in front of you.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.630
And it's certainly better
in the bends than any Kia

17:53.630 --> 17:56.830
I've driven before.
Heavy on the brakes into Hammerhead,

17:56.830 --> 17:59.230
throw it left, throw it right.

17:59.230 --> 18:01.150
Oh, yes!

18:01.150 --> 18:03.630
There's loads of power,
loads of noise.

18:03.630 --> 18:05.230
A decent amount of grip.

18:06.990 --> 18:10.750
You can feel that momentum, pushing
you out wide, but the tyres,

18:10.750 --> 18:13.030
they do hang on.
Until, of course...

18:15.430 --> 18:17.110
..you switch everything off.

18:20.350 --> 18:24.190
Yes, it will go sideways,
I'm doing skids...

18:25.310 --> 18:26.470
..in a Kia!

18:31.830 --> 18:33.990
It's like moonwalking, in brogues.

18:35.150 --> 18:36.950
It feels so wrong.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.670
And, yet, so right!

18:41.110 --> 18:44.670
This is the most memorable car
to come out of South Korea since...

18:45.910 --> 18:49.190
I mean, that's the whole point,
isn't it? It's a memorable car

18:49.190 --> 18:50.630
to come out of South Korea.

18:52.390 --> 18:56.750
The Stinger is, in many ways,
a ground-breaking car.

18:56.750 --> 19:00.150
But, in many more ways, it isn't.

19:00.150 --> 19:03.590
When you think South Korea,
you think tech,

19:03.590 --> 19:05.910
home of Samsung, LG,

19:05.910 --> 19:10.430
a country at the cutting edge of
microchips, nanos and other small,

19:10.430 --> 19:12.030
complicated things.

19:12.030 --> 19:16.430
So, you might expect South Korea's
take on the performance car

19:16.430 --> 19:21.070
to be a blue-sky thinking,
outside-the-box shower of ideas.

19:21.070 --> 19:24.310
But the Stinger isn't
a different take.

19:24.310 --> 19:26.230
It's old school.

19:26.230 --> 19:30.390
Under the bonnet, you won't find
the next big thing in hybrid drive,

19:30.390 --> 19:34.430
but a very ordinary twin turbo,
six-cylinder petrol engine.

19:37.110 --> 19:39.550
The whole car is very similar,
in fact,

19:39.550 --> 19:41.830
to the fast saloons you can
currently choose

19:41.830 --> 19:44.950
from Mercedes and BMW.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.150
And Audi.

19:47.790 --> 19:51.390
Kia has looked at what the Germans
have done recently, and gone,

19:51.390 --> 19:55.590
"Oh, that's interesting, we'll
do...we'll do, exactly that."

19:56.830 --> 19:59.030
Just not QUITE as well.

20:00.110 --> 20:02.470
For example, the centre console,

20:02.470 --> 20:06.070
this isn't so much imitation
carbon fibre as

20:06.070 --> 20:08.750
imitation imitation carbon fibre.

20:08.750 --> 20:13.470
And these buttons down here,
they're more Matalan than Mercedes.

20:14.870 --> 20:18.750
Yet, despite these slightly flimsy
finishes, somehow,

20:18.750 --> 20:23.430
the Stinger weighs nearly two
tonnes. This is not a light car.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.790
I mean, one way to look at that is
that you are getting

20:27.790 --> 20:30.550
quite a lot of kilos
for the cash.

20:30.550 --> 20:34.430
Until, that is, you find out
how much it costs.

20:34.430 --> 20:36.790
Â£40,000.

20:36.790 --> 20:40.070
Which is quite a lot for a Kia.

20:40.070 --> 20:43.510
Now, don't get me wrong,
the Stinger is a good car,

20:43.510 --> 20:47.790
a big...no, HUGE improvement
over previous Kias.

20:47.790 --> 20:51.710
But if South Korea wants to take
on Germany at its own game,

20:51.710 --> 20:54.070
they'll have to do better.

20:54.070 --> 20:55.270
So it's just as well...

20:56.430 --> 20:57.950
..they've sent backup.

21:12.710 --> 21:18.030
This is the i30 N, Hyundai's answer
to the Golf GTI.

21:18.030 --> 21:21.710
Yes, as if a sporty Korean saloon
wasn't weird enough,

21:21.710 --> 21:24.350
now Hyundai are going after
Volkswagen

21:24.350 --> 21:26.910
and the greatest hot hatch of
them all.

21:26.910 --> 21:30.390
Just like the Golf, it uses
a two-litre turbo engine,

21:30.390 --> 21:31.590
driving the front wheels.

21:36.750 --> 21:38.150
Just like the Golf,

21:38.150 --> 21:41.070
it costs just under Â£30,000.

21:41.070 --> 21:43.350
And not just like the Golf...

21:43.350 --> 21:44.950
..it really is quite powerful.

21:46.230 --> 21:51.070
Yes, where the Golf GTI has to
make do with 230 horsepower,

21:51.070 --> 21:54.910
the Hyundai develops 270.

21:54.910 --> 21:57.630
That is a hot, hot hatch.

21:57.630 --> 21:59.310
0-60 takes six seconds.

21:59.310 --> 22:04.670
Top speed - limited to 155mph.

22:04.670 --> 22:07.270
Yeah!

22:07.270 --> 22:09.710
Oh, my God, that's quick.

22:10.910 --> 22:14.870
Hyundai's let its hair down.
Had a couple of pina coladas.

22:14.870 --> 22:17.590
It turns out,
they DO know how to party.

22:18.550 --> 22:22.470
The "N" stands for "Not as bad
as you might think!"

22:24.790 --> 22:26.830
It is all good in here.

22:26.830 --> 22:30.510
Manual gearbox - good,
adjustable suspension - good.

22:30.510 --> 22:33.710
Clever electronic differential thing
between the front wheels.

22:33.710 --> 22:36.230
Good. Nice, sharp turning.

22:36.230 --> 22:38.230
This thing is a joy.

22:38.230 --> 22:40.430
In fact, I was wrong.

22:40.430 --> 22:43.910
The "N" doesn't stand for
"Not as bad as you might think" -

22:43.910 --> 22:46.430
the "N" stands for "nutter"!

22:51.230 --> 22:53.670
Oh, I see. Let's have some fun.

22:54.710 --> 22:57.110
Right, late on the brakes, turn in.

22:58.150 --> 23:01.030
I'm going to get him on the exit.
Yes!

23:01.030 --> 23:03.310
Too much sideways.

23:03.310 --> 23:05.670
Oh, listen to the exhaust.

23:05.670 --> 23:07.470
EXHAUST RUMBLES

23:07.470 --> 23:09.470
Oh, no, you don't.

23:09.470 --> 23:10.950
He's got me!

23:10.950 --> 23:12.430
Right, I'm going in quicker.

23:16.150 --> 23:18.350
Yes! Yes!

23:18.350 --> 23:19.390
Yes!

23:21.430 --> 23:23.750
Look at this! Look at this!

23:23.750 --> 23:26.670
What we have here is a world first.

23:26.670 --> 23:29.790
I'm having fun
in a South Korean car!

23:29.790 --> 23:31.430
And together...

23:31.430 --> 23:34.830
All right, all right, truce.
We're on the same side!

23:34.830 --> 23:40.310
..the i30 N and the Stinger
raise a very important question.

23:40.310 --> 23:42.470
Where, after all this excitement,

23:42.470 --> 23:44.910
does this leave South Korea
on the Top Gear

23:44.910 --> 23:49.230
International League Table Of
Countries That Make The Fastest Car?

23:49.230 --> 23:53.470
Or TGILTOCTMTFC, for short.

23:53.470 --> 23:56.190
Well, check it out.

23:56.190 --> 23:59.790
Now, I'm expecting big things
from Botswana,

23:59.790 --> 24:02.190
but, today, we're looking way,

24:02.190 --> 24:03.870
way up there.

24:03.870 --> 24:07.710
Using a highly sophisticated
and scientific algorithm

24:07.710 --> 24:11.350
formulated by cross-referencing
countries and car-makers

24:11.350 --> 24:13.310
that we could remember,

24:13.310 --> 24:18.470
I'm excited to reveal that the i30 N
and the Stinger have pushed

24:18.470 --> 24:21.550
South Korea three places from 11th

24:21.550 --> 24:25.270
to eighth,
leapfrogging Australia, Czechia,

24:25.270 --> 24:28.230
which is what the Czech Republic
prefers to be known as these days,

24:28.230 --> 24:30.030
and Spain.

24:34.310 --> 24:36.270
I'll just put that there.

24:38.550 --> 24:40.910
This is highly precarious.

24:40.910 --> 24:42.950
We don't need Australia.

24:42.950 --> 24:44.230
Couldn't we get magnets?

24:45.310 --> 24:47.310
Right, I'll just hold it there.

24:47.310 --> 24:49.350
In your face, Spain.

24:49.350 --> 24:51.190
You know where they don't take
siestas?

24:52.390 --> 24:53.750
South Korea.

24:53.750 --> 24:56.030
Right, can I get down, please?

24:58.430 --> 25:01.670
South Korea, then, is heading up
in the world.

25:01.670 --> 25:05.550
Not so long ago, you couldn't have
imagined Kia or Hyundai building

25:05.550 --> 25:08.430
a serious rival to a Vauxhall Corsa.

25:09.630 --> 25:13.150
And, now, here they are, taking on
the best in the business.

25:13.150 --> 25:15.510
It's admirable stuff.

25:15.510 --> 25:18.030
But I know what you're expecting me
to say here.

25:18.030 --> 25:22.190
You're expecting me to say, "Yes,
well done, South Korea, good effort,

25:22.190 --> 25:26.630
"you've made great strides,"
and then tell you to buy German.

25:26.630 --> 25:28.550
And that is what I will tell you.

25:28.550 --> 25:33.150
For the Kia Stinger, it's missing
that last bit of polish,

25:33.150 --> 25:35.070
that sprinkling of magic.

25:35.070 --> 25:38.710
It's just a bit too...fat.

25:42.110 --> 25:43.870
But the i30 N?

25:43.870 --> 25:48.110
Different story. Because, if it's
this, or a base Golf GTI,

25:48.110 --> 25:49.470
I'm picking the Hyundai.

25:49.470 --> 25:52.350
More power, more speed,
and, for me, more fun.

25:54.150 --> 25:57.750
With the i30 N, the South Koreans
aren't just going up in the world...

25:59.310 --> 26:00.830
..they've arrived.

26:15.150 --> 26:16.950
- Good South Korean cars. - Great cars.

26:18.270 --> 26:19.630
Let's talk about the cars.

26:19.630 --> 26:22.030
So, we can forget about the Kia
Stinger, right?

26:22.030 --> 26:23.470
Yeah, overhyped.

26:23.470 --> 26:26.870
But you're telling me you'd rather
have that than a Golf GTI?

26:26.870 --> 26:30.390
- All day long. - So, that badge
on your driveway

26:30.390 --> 26:32.350
rather than a Volkswagen badge?

26:32.350 --> 26:35.270
Yeah, I just, kind of, drive it, and
park it up right against the house,

26:35.270 --> 26:38.550
- no-one can see it. - You know there's
a badge on the back as well?

26:38.550 --> 26:40.190
I'll rent a garage, I don't know.

26:43.230 --> 26:47.390
So, Rory reckons the i30 N
is better than a Golf GTI.

26:47.390 --> 26:49.990
Well, it's time to find out
using science,

26:49.990 --> 26:54.270
as we hand over both cars to our
in-house hot hatch connoisseurs,

26:54.270 --> 26:56.910
it's the Stig's teenage cousins!

26:58.350 --> 27:00.990
There they are, typical teenagers,
five yards apart,

27:00.990 --> 27:03.150
still communicating by text.

27:08.070 --> 27:11.150
The Hyundai's got the jump off
the line, but here comes the Golf.

27:11.150 --> 27:12.670
Terrible weather conditions.

27:14.230 --> 27:16.070
Side by side into the first corner.

27:17.190 --> 27:19.870
How is he staying ahead,
that particular spotty Stig?

27:19.870 --> 27:22.030
Can you smell the Lynx Africa
from here?

27:24.230 --> 27:27.390
The Golf still ahead at this point,
the Golf has a power disadvantage,

27:27.390 --> 27:29.870
I don't know how it's still ahead,
but it's doing a good job.

27:29.870 --> 27:31.110
Oh, a bit sideways there.

27:34.110 --> 27:36.710
Now, powering down the back
straight, Golf still ahead.

27:43.030 --> 27:44.550
Round the Hammerhead.

27:44.550 --> 27:47.270
Come on, that Hyundai looks
poised to me, here it comes.

27:47.270 --> 27:49.110
Here it comes, all attitude,

27:53.270 --> 27:56.510
Up the inside,
now that's a fast move.

27:56.510 --> 27:59.590
Oh, my Lord. Look at that!

27:59.590 --> 28:02.750
Yeah, that's full Asbo spec,
that is. Good driving.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.830
Second to last, and the Hyundai
is out of sight now.

28:07.830 --> 28:09.470
So far apart.

28:09.470 --> 28:11.790
It's all over the place,
under braking.

28:15.950 --> 28:19.030
Now we're going through Gambon,
over the line,

28:19.030 --> 28:21.190
and that is a victory
for the Hyundai.

28:21.190 --> 28:22.230
Impressive.

28:22.230 --> 28:23.670
APPLAUSE

28:25.070 --> 28:26.110
OK.

28:29.310 --> 28:31.870
Much as it pains me to admit it,
you called it. You were right.

28:31.870 --> 28:34.750
- Mm-hm. - OK. So, a victory to the
Hyundai, but what was the margin?

28:34.750 --> 28:38.030
The weather was terrible, OK,
so don't judge them too harshly.

28:38.030 --> 28:41.830
The Volkswagen Golf GTI
did it in a 1:39.3,

28:41.830 --> 28:45.230
which puts it somewhere down
near the floorboards.

28:45.230 --> 28:48.070
Very wet though, don't forget that.
The Hyundai, however...

28:50.710 --> 28:52.830
..a 134.6.

28:52.830 --> 28:54.590
- Get in! - That's an absolute...

28:56.350 --> 28:58.910
- That's a drubbing. - There you go.

28:58.910 --> 29:01.470
That's a crushing, crushing victory.

29:03.150 --> 29:04.630
Matthew?

29:04.630 --> 29:07.030
And now it's time to put not one
but two stars

29:07.030 --> 29:09.030
in our Reasonably Fast Car.

29:09.030 --> 29:13.150
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Dara O Briain, and Ed Byrne.

29:20.150 --> 29:24.150
All right, buddy. Welcome. Welcome,
welcome, take a seat.

29:27.430 --> 29:29.830
Great to have you. Great to have
you. Now, you guys

29:29.830 --> 29:33.230
are great friends, right? You were
best man at each other's weddings?

29:33.230 --> 29:35.430
Yes, we were, yes.

29:35.430 --> 29:38.470
I mean, are we cueing up how
naturally competitive we are?

29:38.470 --> 29:41.390
Or are you thinking because we are
just pals, it's OK,

29:41.390 --> 29:43.830
- I'll be happy if he wins?
I won't be. - He'll be raging.

29:43.830 --> 29:46.030
Everyone says that.
"Oh, no big deal, no big deal."

29:46.030 --> 29:49.110
- And then when they get out there...
- Well, he did that. That's the thing.

29:49.110 --> 29:51.510
He phoned me yesterday, we were on
the phone to each other

29:51.510 --> 29:53.870
yesterday, he was all, "It doesn't
matter. I'm not really

29:53.870 --> 29:56.390
"that fussed about it. We'll a
laugh. The interview will be fun

29:56.390 --> 29:58.310
"and stuff. I don't really care
about the lap."

29:58.310 --> 30:00.750
And I know as soon as he got behind
the wheel, he was like,

30:00.750 --> 30:02.430
"So long as I'm faster than Ed!"

30:02.430 --> 30:04.870
Yeah, that's just to get you to let
your guard down.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.430
Yeah. Exactly. It didn't work.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.110
- Did it not? - No. - So, you're both
on tour at the moment?

30:09.110 --> 30:11.510
Yes. Separately, obviously.

30:11.510 --> 30:14.070
We overlap in Aberdeen
and Newcastle.

30:14.070 --> 30:16.270
- Yeah. - In the same night.

30:16.270 --> 30:17.750
So, watch out!

30:20.110 --> 30:22.630
We are going to have some drinks
in those cities.

30:23.710 --> 30:25.870
That will be pretty wild.
We're both crisscrossing,

30:25.870 --> 30:28.550
so, we're both on the motorway
a lot over the next while.

30:28.550 --> 30:29.870
How's it going? Good?

30:29.870 --> 30:34.590
It's going sweet, I'm on until June,
with a show called Spoiler Alert.

30:34.590 --> 30:37.550
And I'm on until next year sometime.
Voice Of Reason until next year,

30:37.550 --> 30:39.710
I started a little later than you.

30:39.710 --> 30:42.190
- Any competition there, like...
- No. He's...

30:42.190 --> 30:43.870
I rock up to venues,
and they're like,

30:43.870 --> 30:46.950
"Oh, yeah, Dara O Briain here for
four nights, sold out last time."

30:46.950 --> 30:50.070
And I'm like, right, here's me
struggling to just about

30:50.070 --> 30:53.350
fill it once. I know my place.
Hopefully, I'll get a faster time

30:53.350 --> 30:56.070
- than him, and that will count
for something. - Yeah.

30:56.070 --> 30:58.790
- There you go. - All the ticket sales
are based on how we do here today.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.110
So, that'll be great.

31:00.110 --> 31:02.030
All right, let's talk about your
driving history.

31:02.030 --> 31:03.830
You're both kind of,
late starters, right?

31:03.830 --> 31:06.950
- Mm. - Yeah, I came to driving
quite late.

31:06.950 --> 31:10.470
I started lying, and telling people
I'd lost my license

31:10.470 --> 31:14.230
because there was less shame in
that than not having got it yet.

31:14.230 --> 31:18.150
Can you clarify how it works having
a provisional licence in Ireland?

31:18.150 --> 31:21.390
Because the research notes
slightly confused me.

31:21.390 --> 31:24.750
I mean, are you thrown by the fact
it seems to be that if you have

31:24.750 --> 31:28.310
a provisional licence,
you're allowed to totally drive
for free, in Ireland?

31:28.310 --> 31:31.710
- Yes. - That may no longer be the case,
I can't guarantee,

31:31.710 --> 31:35.150
but that certainly was the case,
because I had it for three,

31:35.150 --> 31:37.470
four years, just on
it with a P, or an L...

31:37.470 --> 31:40.470
So, what was the benefit in having a
full driving licence as opposed to

31:40.470 --> 31:42.550
- a provisional licence?
- Bragging rights.

31:42.550 --> 31:45.430
- Yeah. - That's all.
- You put it like that, actually...

31:45.430 --> 31:48.310
I mean, I'm surprised they didn't
just phase out the full licence!

31:48.310 --> 31:51.150
And just make it all provisional.

31:51.150 --> 31:52.590
Yeah, it was quite loose.

31:52.590 --> 31:55.790
- So, first cars? - The first car
I bought was a Seat Ibiza.

31:55.790 --> 31:58.790
And I couldn't drive it,
my girlfriend drove it.

31:58.790 --> 32:01.110
- That was, that was the deal.
- The first car for me

32:01.110 --> 32:03.510
was a Ford Fiesta, like,
a 1991 Ford Fiesta

32:03.510 --> 32:06.190
that I managed to crash twice
in the same crash.

32:07.710 --> 32:10.190
- You have to explain that. - Yeah.
There was a crash,

32:10.190 --> 32:13.030
it was my ineptitude. I'd only been
driving a couple of months,

32:13.030 --> 32:15.110
and I popped out from behind
a stop sign,

32:15.110 --> 32:17.190
would be the discreet
way of putting it,

32:17.190 --> 32:20.670
and much to the excitement of the
car who was on the road at the time,

32:20.670 --> 32:23.670
so he nudged me into a wall, and
then my dad came round,

32:23.670 --> 32:26.470
and went, "OK, fine, we'll take this
car off somewhere to be repaired."

32:26.470 --> 32:29.430
I said, "Great," and we pulled out,
and I sat in the car,

32:29.430 --> 32:31.470
and he attached a tow rope to
this car.

32:31.470 --> 32:35.110
This already crashed car, and he was
ready to tow it, and I said,

32:35.110 --> 32:38.390
"Brilliant," thumbs up, like,
whatever, and he pulled off, and I
pulled off,

32:38.390 --> 32:41.150
and I'm pulling the wheel, but
nobody told me you have to put

32:41.150 --> 32:43.310
the car into neutral when you're
being towed.

32:43.310 --> 32:45.950
So, I, on the first move, it locked,

32:45.950 --> 32:49.590
and then my dad pulled the car out
of this position, across the road,

32:49.590 --> 32:51.190
into another wall.

32:51.190 --> 32:55.830
So I hit two sides, two walls on the
side of the same road, twice,

32:55.830 --> 32:58.630
with the same car, and just, it was
just gone. It was written off

32:58.630 --> 33:01.110
- at that stage. - Have you ever seen
a Laurel and Hardy film?

33:01.110 --> 33:04.390
- Yes. - Essentially that. - That's all
you have to say. - Ed, your first car,

33:04.390 --> 33:06.790
having passed your driving test,
is extraordinary.

33:06.790 --> 33:08.750
I think the audience will agree
with this.

33:08.750 --> 33:11.510
The first car after passing my test,
the first car I got for myself,

33:11.510 --> 33:13.630
was a Mercedes SL 350.

33:13.630 --> 33:15.470
Yeah, not too shabby.

33:15.470 --> 33:18.030
That was called Nora,
I called that car.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.710
Cos Nora Batty, and it was
a tiny bit like the Batmobile.

33:20.710 --> 33:23.990
I name all my cars, and they all
have silly names.

33:23.990 --> 33:25.790
What came after that one?

33:25.790 --> 33:29.270
A Volkswagen Golf
called James Golfandini.

33:31.430 --> 33:34.510
And I think there was another
Golf called Revvy Ballesteros.

33:36.110 --> 33:39.950
And I got rid of that, and I now
have a Jeep Renegade which is

33:39.950 --> 33:43.110
called Lorenzo, after Lorenzo Lamas,
who played the title role

33:43.110 --> 33:46.190
in the obscure, yet seminal,
'90s TV show, Renegade.

33:46.190 --> 33:49.870
I'm good at naming cars.
That's my Renegade, there.

33:49.870 --> 33:52.270
And that's the canoe on top
that's called Stinky Pete,

33:52.270 --> 33:54.430
cos it's an old prospector.

33:54.430 --> 33:56.230
I can't help myself.

33:56.230 --> 33:58.190
- You named your canoe? - Yeah.

33:58.190 --> 33:59.510
I name everything.

33:59.510 --> 34:01.870
Can you imagine anything about him
he hasn't named?

34:05.670 --> 34:08.909
Now, Dara, your car history
is a bit more exotic, right?

34:08.909 --> 34:11.270
Well, I learned to drive with an
Audi TT. I thought

34:11.270 --> 34:14.030
when I started again, I might as
well start with an Audi TT.

34:14.030 --> 34:16.630
- That's punchy, as well. - Yeah, it's a
zippy little thing, yeah.

34:16.630 --> 34:19.670
I got my test with that.
You fit in an Audi TT?

34:19.670 --> 34:23.030
- Not very well. - I can't fit in one of
those! - There's an element to which,

34:23.030 --> 34:25.230
if you put to the roof down,
I look like Noddy.

34:26.510 --> 34:28.510
But I was very happy
in the Audi TT.

34:28.510 --> 34:32.190
It was very pleasant.
Now I have a Maserati Grancabrio,

34:32.190 --> 34:36.110
which is the soft top,
with the four seats, which is...

34:36.110 --> 34:38.350
Yeah, you're going, "Ooh!"

34:38.350 --> 34:40.429
That's actually your driveway,
isn't it?

34:40.429 --> 34:42.310
It is, actually.
Well, we opened it out.

34:42.310 --> 34:45.270
I mean, most of the time,
West London doesn't look like that.

34:45.270 --> 34:47.070
Who cleans your pool, by the way?

34:48.110 --> 34:51.310
He's constantly at it.
Takes ages, to be honest.

34:51.310 --> 34:53.870
It's a... It's a very pretty car.
It's a very lovely car.

34:53.870 --> 34:57.030
- And they're quiet? - There's a nice
noise off it, you know.

34:57.030 --> 35:01.270
What? Does it have a sufficient
noise to it? It's obnoxiously loud!

35:01.270 --> 35:03.670
Yeah, there is a point where they
sold, I think, four

35:03.670 --> 35:07.190
on my road and surrounding area,
they had a big push on them.

35:07.190 --> 35:10.550
There was some sort of deal, and at
eight in the morning it's...

35:10.550 --> 35:12.550
HE IMITATES ENGINES ROARING

35:12.550 --> 35:15.150
All the people leaving
at different times.

35:15.150 --> 35:17.430
- They are very loud.
- It's got a lovely noise on it.

35:17.430 --> 35:19.910
What's it like for carrying
a 16-foot canoe on the roof?

35:19.910 --> 35:22.030
Not so good. And, interestingly,

35:22.030 --> 35:25.510
a Venn diagram of people who drive
Maserati Grancabrios and people who

35:25.510 --> 35:27.590
- give a - BLEEP - about canoeing is...

35:28.870 --> 35:30.830
There's surprisingly small overlap.

35:32.990 --> 35:35.110
No, it's not really for people...

35:35.110 --> 35:38.310
It's great for stepping out of a
private beach club in Monte Carlo,

35:38.310 --> 35:39.830
but not so much for the canoeing.

35:39.830 --> 35:43.270
All right, what do you think?
Take a look at your laps?

35:43.270 --> 35:47.230
Yeah, go on. How did it go, come on,
let's have... What about conditions?

35:47.230 --> 35:50.590
It was wet. First of all, can we
just say that, it was very wet.

35:50.590 --> 35:52.230
I'm surprised you've any footage

35:52.230 --> 35:54.630
because the lenses must have been
just pounded with water.

35:54.630 --> 35:57.350
It was incredibly wet. I don't think
there's been a day like this.

35:57.350 --> 36:00.190
I saw you in the production office,
you were walking around, I said,

36:00.190 --> 36:03.550
"How did it go?" You said,
"It was good, but it's drier out
there for Dara now."

36:03.550 --> 36:06.470
Yes, I went first.
I went first. It's always, always,

36:06.470 --> 36:08.710
everything just comes up roses
for this dick.

36:10.590 --> 36:13.390
It's always, like, I'm there, I've
got the windscreen wipers on

36:13.390 --> 36:16.190
and everything, going through this
monsoon weather, and as soon as

36:16.190 --> 36:18.030
I get out of the car,
rainbows, sunshine...

36:18.030 --> 36:19.350
SINGS ANGELICALLY

36:19.350 --> 36:22.150
There you go, Dara, away for an
hour, steam coming off the track,

36:22.150 --> 36:24.590
on you go, dry as a bone.
I hate you!

36:26.030 --> 36:28.110
I want a W next to my name.

36:29.110 --> 36:31.590
And just a D, for damp, next to his.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.990
OK, well, maybe, first, we'll take
a look at Dara's lap.

36:34.990 --> 36:36.550
And, while we're watching that,

36:36.550 --> 36:39.150
- we can get a little marriage
counselling for you. - Yes!

36:39.150 --> 36:41.390
All right, let's take a look at
Dara's lap.

36:41.390 --> 36:44.470
So, this is Dara, the track's
looking pretty dry.

36:44.470 --> 36:45.910
Little bit of a stumbled start.

36:45.910 --> 36:48.670
Operation crush Ed's dreams.

36:48.670 --> 36:50.910
So, not remotely competitive!

36:50.910 --> 36:54.070
Now, your line through here
was always pretty good.

36:56.150 --> 36:59.030
That was just...
So many G forces!

36:59.030 --> 37:00.750
It doesn't look fast.

37:00.750 --> 37:03.310
OK, don't hit the tyres,
don't hit the tyres.

37:03.310 --> 37:06.630
- Don't hit the tyres.
- You didn't hit the tyres.

37:06.630 --> 37:08.870
The exit of Chicago, smooth again.

37:08.870 --> 37:11.190
- Oh, no, no, oh, no. - BLEEP - you!

37:11.190 --> 37:15.030
The violent slap between the seats
indicates something else.

37:15.030 --> 37:16.470
Now, driving the car really fast.

37:17.990 --> 37:20.670
God, Ed will be so disappointed
when he loses this.

37:20.670 --> 37:22.310
He seems confident, doesn't he?

37:22.310 --> 37:24.830
Here, around the invisible
Hammerhead.

37:24.830 --> 37:26.750
Why? What's supposed to be here?

37:26.750 --> 37:29.590
Put some trestle tables with
custard pies on it, or something.

37:29.590 --> 37:31.670
You've got...you've got the
left-right bit

37:31.670 --> 37:35.750
- for the first time in the day,
I think, there. - Bollards, anything.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.230
Inflatable things.

37:38.710 --> 37:40.950
Go into...fourth gear!

37:40.950 --> 37:43.270
There's even a fifth and sixth,
we'll never use it,

37:43.270 --> 37:44.550
it's hard to get out of third.

37:44.550 --> 37:46.950
Stop that! Got this corner.

37:46.950 --> 37:49.430
Follow Through, Follow Through.

37:49.430 --> 37:52.710
That was good speed.
Now the tyre wall.

37:52.710 --> 37:55.710
And this one, that you keep saying
don't brake on.

37:55.710 --> 37:58.190
Has Ed broke on it? Well, then,
I'm not going to brake on it.

37:58.190 --> 38:00.790
Good speed.
Oh, that was a brake light.

38:00.790 --> 38:03.550
Coming in to second to last.

38:03.550 --> 38:06.310
Tricky seeing this one.
Now onto the slippery bit.

38:07.510 --> 38:09.030
Oh, whoa, whoa.

38:09.030 --> 38:11.630
Through there, safely.
And now through Gambon.

38:11.630 --> 38:12.910
Completely slowed down.

38:13.990 --> 38:16.950
- And over the line. - OK.

38:19.590 --> 38:21.990
Yeah, I think there's
very little in it.

38:21.990 --> 38:25.270
- Yeah? - I think that looked pretty
racy, actually?

38:25.270 --> 38:26.510
I think it looked smooth.

38:26.510 --> 38:28.910
Honestly, the first turn,
I thought I'd lost it.

38:28.910 --> 38:31.190
I honestly thought,
"Oh, you've screwed that up now."

38:31.190 --> 38:33.830
I thought I'd gone way too wide
and lost control of it there,

38:33.830 --> 38:36.630
because of the conditions.
You can see, from the driving rain.

38:36.630 --> 38:39.750
And the sleet.
Which cameras can't pick up on.

38:39.750 --> 38:41.990
It looked like you carried pretty
good corner speed,

38:41.990 --> 38:44.470
I didn't see a lot of wheel spin.
Right, let's see Ed's lap.

38:44.470 --> 38:47.550
OK. Well, that's wetter,
definitely wetter.

38:47.550 --> 38:50.190
Cleaner start. Using more revs.

38:50.190 --> 38:52.830
Yes, you might sell more tickets
than I do,

38:52.830 --> 38:54.070
when you're on tour...

38:55.830 --> 38:59.230
..but who, who will be faster
round the Top Gear track?

39:00.350 --> 39:03.430
Slightly wider on the way in,
is he tighter through the corner?

39:03.430 --> 39:05.870
He is. And more speed on the exit,
too.

39:05.870 --> 39:07.750
Perfect, nailed that.

39:07.750 --> 39:10.830
That's for the time you opened
for me, and were funnier.

39:13.990 --> 39:15.790
You really warmed to this!

39:15.790 --> 39:18.630
That's for having
a bigger house than I have.

39:23.510 --> 39:25.910
Stick that up Brian Cox's bum!

39:29.630 --> 39:32.670
Exit of Hammerhead, I don't know
what to say after that!

39:32.670 --> 39:35.230
OK, got a bit cocky there,
almost lost it.

39:35.230 --> 39:37.430
Down the back straight,
through the Follow Through.

39:37.430 --> 39:40.310
This is for getting me to be your
best man, and then doing a speech,

39:40.310 --> 39:44.750
just before mine, and being even
funnier than my best man speech was!

39:46.830 --> 39:48.830
No brake lights, all right.

39:50.590 --> 39:52.030
There you go. Nailed it.

39:52.030 --> 39:54.710
Nailed it. OK, brake,
and change down.

39:56.230 --> 39:59.110
Unstable on the entry,
and now the super slippery bit.

39:59.110 --> 40:01.510
Man, I can't wait for the next
episode of Mock The Week,

40:01.510 --> 40:04.110
you ain't never going to live
this down. I have destroyed you.

40:04.110 --> 40:07.710
And now Gambon, oh, a big slide,
showboating.

40:07.710 --> 40:09.430
Over the line, that looked quick.

40:13.830 --> 40:19.430
Hey, not only...not only was that
a lot of very good driving,

40:19.430 --> 40:21.510
I also thought you got
a lot out of your system.

40:21.510 --> 40:23.950
- That was very cathartic.
- Very therapeutic.

40:23.950 --> 40:27.590
- Yeah. - I can't believe how much I
care about numbers that are written

40:27.590 --> 40:31.150
right there. It makes no difference
to anything, and I care deeply.

40:31.150 --> 40:32.870
I'm looking at this, right here,

40:32.870 --> 40:35.350
and I used to share a flat with
Ross Noble,

40:35.350 --> 40:37.230
I know I'm nowhere near there.

40:37.230 --> 40:39.350
But I'm looking at Lee Mack,
and I'm thinking...

40:39.350 --> 40:41.670
Yeah, he's a realistic target.

40:41.670 --> 40:45.030
What I'm thinking is we could
pretty much forget the lap board,

40:45.030 --> 40:47.150
this is about head-to-head.

40:47.150 --> 40:49.310
- I mean, it's clear, is it not?
- It's a grudge match.

40:49.310 --> 40:53.470
Yeah, OK. So, you've got
the same car, same conditions.

40:53.470 --> 40:56.990
Roughly the same conditions.
Roughly the same conditions.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.710
Not being petty, just...

41:01.710 --> 41:03.630
You don't even know the times yet!

41:03.630 --> 41:06.110
No, I don't, but I'm already
making excuses.

41:08.270 --> 41:11.110
- All right. Are you ready?
- Yeah. - Yeah.

41:11.110 --> 41:15.750
Dara. You did it in one minute...

41:15.750 --> 41:19.150
..53.2.

41:19.150 --> 41:20.190
OK.

41:24.470 --> 41:26.910
- You beat Lee Mack.
- Beat Lee Mack.

41:26.910 --> 41:29.590
I'm disappointed I didn't beat John
Culshaw, but I beat Lee Mack.

41:29.590 --> 41:31.950
- That's a good thing.
- But, remember, we're wet.

41:31.950 --> 41:33.070
Wet, yeah.

41:33.070 --> 41:35.910
One minute, 53.2. OK. And Ed?

41:35.910 --> 41:37.870
You did it...

41:37.870 --> 41:40.270
..in two... No, I'm kidding.

41:42.550 --> 41:44.310
OK, you did it in one minute...

41:46.190 --> 41:48.350
..50...

41:48.350 --> 41:49.870
..point zero.

41:54.310 --> 41:56.830
Do you see what you get?
Do you see what you get?!

42:05.430 --> 42:08.190
Ladies and gentlemen, Ed Byrne,
and Dara O Briain!

42:08.190 --> 42:10.910
- Well done, mate. Hope you enjoyed
it. - Great job. Great job.

42:17.670 --> 42:19.110
That was funny, funny guys.

42:23.510 --> 42:25.190
Now, big question.

42:25.190 --> 42:28.150
What's the most game-changing
car of them all?

42:29.310 --> 42:31.910
Well, there's the Mercedes S class.

42:31.910 --> 42:34.270
Introduced ABS, airbags,

42:34.270 --> 42:36.710
like, a million tech firsts,

42:36.710 --> 42:39.630
or the Tesla Model S,
electric pioneer.

42:41.190 --> 42:43.630
Not even close, OK?

42:43.630 --> 42:47.870
Because there's one out there that's
even cleverer than the S class,

42:47.870 --> 42:51.990
or the Tesla. A car that defines
cutting edge.

42:51.990 --> 42:53.470
Who are you talking to?

43:05.510 --> 43:07.670
It's a quintessential
slice of France

43:07.670 --> 43:12.470
that has amazed, delighted, and
charmed the world over for 70 years.

43:14.790 --> 43:16.630
And, in my humble opinion,

43:16.630 --> 43:19.870
it is one of the most perfect cars
that has ever existed.

43:21.510 --> 43:24.590
Yes, it's the Citroen 2CV.

43:24.590 --> 43:26.550
It may not be conventionally
beautiful,

43:26.550 --> 43:30.070
or even unconventionally beautiful,
but this...

43:30.070 --> 43:33.110
..this might be the most
ground-breaking car of the lot.

43:37.430 --> 43:40.270
And this...this is just joyous.

43:40.270 --> 43:43.550
Driving a 2CV on a minor,
rural, French road

43:43.550 --> 43:46.550
is the same as driving
a Ferrari at Fiorano.

43:46.550 --> 43:48.310
I'm in its element.

43:48.310 --> 43:50.070
I'm in context.

43:50.070 --> 43:51.110
I love it.

43:52.910 --> 43:55.510
You want to know how much
I love the 2CV?

43:56.510 --> 43:57.990
I love it so much I bought one.

43:59.230 --> 44:00.950
This one.

44:00.950 --> 44:02.630
This is my 2CV.

44:07.670 --> 44:13.990
Citroen launched the 2CV in 1948, a
hardy car for both road and field,

44:13.990 --> 44:16.910
developed for over a decade
to bring rural France

44:16.910 --> 44:19.510
a better alternative
to the horse and cart.

44:20.910 --> 44:22.550
And, boy, did they succeed!

44:24.910 --> 44:28.030
With its simple but robust
air-cooled engine,

44:28.030 --> 44:30.790
its pioneering all-terrain ride,

44:30.790 --> 44:34.910
and its uncanny ability to carry
way more stuff than you'd expect,

44:34.910 --> 44:39.230
the 2CV was an unprecedented feat
of less-is-more engineering.

44:40.270 --> 44:42.750
In fact, so timeless was the 2CV,

44:42.750 --> 44:45.830
they kept building it
for over 40 years.

44:47.870 --> 44:50.230
They say that necessity is the
mother of invention,

44:50.230 --> 44:53.190
and the wonderful 2CV is proof.

44:53.190 --> 44:55.470
There's more ingenuity in this
single door panel

44:55.470 --> 44:59.750
than there is in most car
companies' entire history.

44:59.750 --> 45:03.070
This isn't just a car,
it's a revolutionary.

45:03.070 --> 45:05.630
It's one of the most significant
engineering feats

45:05.630 --> 45:07.630
of the...20th century.

45:07.630 --> 45:11.270
- Where did you come from?
- Not important. What is important

45:11.270 --> 45:15.190
is that you just called this one of
the most significant engineering

45:15.190 --> 45:18.950
- feats of the 20th century. Come on.
- It's perfect. - Are you crazy?

45:18.950 --> 45:21.150
Look, it looks like it's made out
of car parts that...

45:22.310 --> 45:24.150
..none of the other cars wanted.

45:24.150 --> 45:27.550
It's a triumph
of...functional design.

45:27.550 --> 45:28.830
Look at it, it's perfect.

45:31.550 --> 45:34.470
- What? - Look, open your mind.
Don't be facetious.

45:34.470 --> 45:38.230
- OK? Can I take you for a drive
in it? Go on. - No way!

45:38.230 --> 45:39.510
No.

45:49.790 --> 45:51.470
So, let me get this straight.

45:51.470 --> 45:56.710
This is your car, that you bought,
with your money.

45:56.710 --> 45:58.750
- Yes, I did. - Why?

45:58.750 --> 46:01.190
What do you mean, why?

46:01.190 --> 46:04.790
- Aren't you feeling it? - Feeling what?
Claustrophobic? Yeah.

46:07.710 --> 46:08.910
What does it have for a motor?

46:08.910 --> 46:12.550
I mean, I assume it has a motor,
we're moving, but what is it?

46:12.550 --> 46:16.350
A 425cc air-cooled flat twin.

46:16.350 --> 46:19.310
Oh, two cylinders, wow,
they went big!

46:23.150 --> 46:25.030
What does it make for horsepower?

46:25.030 --> 46:27.390
- 12. - 12!

46:30.110 --> 46:31.510
You're an idiot.

46:38.990 --> 46:42.590
Let me tell you about the 2CV's
original design brief.

46:43.830 --> 46:46.270
Citron decreed that it had to be
able to carry

46:46.270 --> 46:51.590
its occupants wearing their church
hats and it had to be driven over

46:51.590 --> 46:55.990
a bumpy field without breaking
a basket of eggs onboard.

46:55.990 --> 46:58.870
- No way. - Yes, way.

47:00.310 --> 47:01.590
Stop the car.

47:04.110 --> 47:05.710
- Where are you going? - Shopping.

47:17.550 --> 47:18.590
OK.

47:19.750 --> 47:22.510
Now. Hat for me, hat for you.

47:24.590 --> 47:26.670
You're such a child,
I'm not wearing that.

47:26.670 --> 47:29.630
Be a good church wife,
and put the damn hat on!

47:31.590 --> 47:35.950
I'm pretty sure that 1940s French
farmers didn't wear stovepipe hats.

47:35.950 --> 47:37.390
Well, this farmer did.

47:40.670 --> 47:44.230
- That's heavy. - That's a very big
basket of eggs.

47:44.230 --> 47:45.910
You're very pretty.

47:48.030 --> 47:50.510
- Shut up! - Now, be careful.

47:53.670 --> 47:58.230
So, Abraham Lincoln wanted to put
the design brief to the test.

47:58.230 --> 48:00.750
Fine. Frankly, the eggs
are safer in the 2CV

48:00.750 --> 48:02.270
than they are in the hen.

48:03.430 --> 48:06.590
We're safe here, this car is going
to pass with flying colours.

48:07.910 --> 48:08.950
OK.

48:11.190 --> 48:12.830
OK. OK!

48:14.230 --> 48:17.630
None of those are moving.
This car is genius!

48:20.030 --> 48:21.750
Oh, there they go.

48:24.710 --> 48:25.990
There they go!

48:29.950 --> 48:31.070
Oh, no!

48:37.910 --> 48:40.790
No, you utter bastard!

48:42.670 --> 48:45.710
- That was a tip. - No, I didn't...
- That was a tip! - I didn't tip it.

48:50.710 --> 48:52.190
That's horrible!

48:55.590 --> 48:57.230
All right, all right. All right!

49:00.870 --> 49:03.190
No!

49:07.310 --> 49:10.590
Oh, they smell so bad.

49:10.590 --> 49:12.710
They smell terrible.

49:15.150 --> 49:16.190
Oh.

49:17.630 --> 49:20.230
OK, well, there you go.

49:23.070 --> 49:26.590
So, as my own eggs will testify,

49:26.590 --> 49:30.830
I would say that your car has failed
to meet one of its design briefs.

49:33.110 --> 49:37.510
One very thorough jet wash later,
Chris decided it was time for lunch.

49:37.510 --> 49:39.910
You want to sit down somewhere,
right? Check this out.

49:39.910 --> 49:41.950
Ugh! It still smells of eggs.

49:41.950 --> 49:45.830
- Whoa, what are you doing?
- This is our seating area.

49:45.830 --> 49:48.190
This is the beauty of the 2CV.

49:48.190 --> 49:51.630
Right, I'm going to find somewhere
cosy and romantic for us, come on.

49:57.190 --> 49:58.710
Put your hamper down.

49:58.710 --> 50:01.550
Come and join me. Take a throne.

50:03.350 --> 50:05.510
You look like a homeless person.

50:06.990 --> 50:08.910
Is this a date?

50:08.910 --> 50:11.550
- I suppose it could be.
- Let's pretend it's not.

50:11.550 --> 50:13.150
OK.

50:13.150 --> 50:14.590
Try that.

50:14.590 --> 50:18.190
- What is this? - That's gentleman's
relish. - What?

50:18.190 --> 50:20.270
And that was the end of lunch.

50:27.390 --> 50:29.870
You genuinely do like this car,
don't you?

50:29.870 --> 50:31.550
I love this car.

50:31.550 --> 50:33.190
This is the essence of motoring.

50:33.190 --> 50:35.830
- This is... - Wow, that's...
- ..essential motoring.

50:35.830 --> 50:39.270
There's an essence in here, but I
don't know that it's motoring.

50:40.910 --> 50:42.790
You'll like this.

50:42.790 --> 50:47.070
The original design brief for the
2CV also specified that it should be

50:47.070 --> 50:49.430
able to carry two adult farmers,

50:49.430 --> 50:54.390
and 50kg of farm produce at 37mph.

50:54.390 --> 50:57.510
- Stop the car. Stop the car. - Please!

51:07.630 --> 51:09.510
Come on.

51:09.510 --> 51:12.910
OK, here you go,
50 kilos of farm produce.

51:12.910 --> 51:14.550
Meet Nicole and Papa.

51:15.830 --> 51:17.510
Could have gone with potatoes.

51:17.510 --> 51:20.110
Yeah, but potatoes won't crap
all over your car.

51:20.110 --> 51:25.270
After all, the egg test had gone
so well, this should be a breeze.

51:25.270 --> 51:27.390
- Ow! - OK.

51:27.390 --> 51:29.110
Let's go.

51:29.110 --> 51:31.910
Hey, hey, you over here,
I'm driving, my turn.

51:31.910 --> 51:34.470
Oh, come on! This is my car.

51:34.470 --> 51:37.910
- I paid for it with my money.
- I know! Still cracks me up!

51:37.910 --> 51:40.070
HE LAUGHS

51:43.670 --> 51:45.030
GEARS CLUNK

51:45.030 --> 51:46.390
Ow!

51:51.470 --> 51:55.270
So, 37mph with 50 kilos
of sheep in the back.

51:56.670 --> 51:59.670
Time to see what
the 2CV was made of.

51:59.670 --> 52:01.230
Right, here we go, downhill, tuck.

52:04.710 --> 52:07.070
- 34. - Come on, deux chevaux. - Come on!

52:09.350 --> 52:11.230
- 36. - Come on, come on!

52:14.830 --> 52:16.190
36.

52:17.790 --> 52:20.990
37. 37mph. There it is.

52:20.990 --> 52:24.390
It worked. It works,
it meets its brief.

52:27.870 --> 52:30.790
And, if driving sheep around
at medium speed

52:30.790 --> 52:32.750
wasn't enough to seduce him,

52:32.750 --> 52:35.390
as we bid au revoir to
Nicole and Papa,

52:35.390 --> 52:37.990
I had one more trick up my sleeve
to convince Matt

52:37.990 --> 52:41.230
that this really is
the greatest car of all time.

52:43.350 --> 52:45.230
Take a left here. There, down there.

52:45.230 --> 52:47.750
- What are you doing?
- We're going racing.

52:47.750 --> 52:48.790
Racing?

52:49.950 --> 52:52.150
Against what? Pedestrians?

52:55.270 --> 52:59.790
No, we'd be racing in what is quite
possibly the finest form of

52:59.790 --> 53:04.350
motorsport,
the 2CV One-Make Championship.

53:06.910 --> 53:09.430
So, here we are,
the world of 2CV racing.

53:09.430 --> 53:11.350
Don't they look fantastic?

53:11.350 --> 53:13.710
- I think they're cool.
- Look how low the rear is.

53:13.710 --> 53:16.710
Yeah, those are way lower
than yours.

53:16.710 --> 53:19.910
Here we go, then.
This is our racing car.

53:21.190 --> 53:22.910
This? Oh, we're not using your car?

53:22.910 --> 53:25.270
No, cos my car is mine.

53:25.270 --> 53:27.670
Anyhow, jump in, you're driving.

53:27.670 --> 53:30.510
- Really? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah! OK.

53:32.950 --> 53:35.350
With upgraded 602cc engines,

53:35.350 --> 53:38.950
producing no less than
50 brake horsepower,

53:38.950 --> 53:44.190
these race-modified monsters can
reach speeds of up to 85mph.

53:44.190 --> 53:47.510
Yes, 2CV racing is serious business.

53:49.070 --> 53:51.310
I noticed that you have
a neck brace.

53:51.310 --> 53:53.430
I don't have a neck brace.
Do I need a neck brace?

53:54.830 --> 53:56.350
No, you don't need a neck brace.

53:56.350 --> 53:58.550
Why do you have a neck brace,
and I don't have one?

53:58.550 --> 54:00.910
Don't get caught up in the details,
you look great.

54:06.750 --> 54:08.910
We'd be up against some of the
finest,

54:08.910 --> 54:12.310
fiercest drivers the 2CV world
had to offer.

54:12.310 --> 54:14.670
And, as we took our position
on the grid,

54:14.670 --> 54:17.470
we were completely focused
on the challenge ahead.

54:18.750 --> 54:20.070
How's the water temperature?

54:21.270 --> 54:23.350
Er...

54:23.350 --> 54:26.070
I don't think we have
a water temperature gauge.

54:26.070 --> 54:29.590
- Maybe there's no water in...
There's no water in this, you - BLEEP!

54:31.230 --> 54:32.550
It took me a minute!

54:38.790 --> 54:39.830
Go!

54:43.190 --> 54:45.230
What a start! What a start.

54:45.230 --> 54:47.750
Go over to the right,
get over to the right.

54:47.750 --> 54:51.230
Squeeze him.
First into the first corner.

54:52.950 --> 54:55.110
There's one coming,
there's one coming.

54:55.110 --> 54:56.590
He's right there.

54:58.230 --> 55:00.310
Brake late, brake late, brake late!

55:02.150 --> 55:03.870
Get in there!

55:05.790 --> 55:08.870
- Where did he come from?
- He's right there.

55:10.030 --> 55:12.270
That's the famous Steve Walford...

55:13.390 --> 55:16.190
..engineering 2CV.

55:16.190 --> 55:18.990
He was the one in the paddock that
was saying that Ross was funnier.

55:18.990 --> 55:21.110
I think he's got it in for you.

55:21.110 --> 55:22.990
But Steve was going down.

55:26.350 --> 55:27.710
Oh, mate, you showed him there.

55:29.510 --> 55:31.030
This is demon stuff, Matthew.

55:32.270 --> 55:35.670
However, as the only two-man team
on the track,

55:35.670 --> 55:38.790
- our car had a weight problem.
- Sorry, Chris.

55:38.790 --> 55:40.630
THUD

55:40.630 --> 55:42.510
- That didn't sound good. - No.

55:45.550 --> 55:47.150
Oh, come on!

55:47.150 --> 55:48.750
It's Rosie Racing.

55:48.750 --> 55:52.270
They're well known in 2CV circles
as being brilliant.

55:53.470 --> 55:56.670
And it wasn't just Rosie
who was out for blood.

55:56.670 --> 55:58.870
- Oh, no, come on. - Got another one up
the inside.

55:59.990 --> 56:01.590
It's the famous Steve Walford again.

56:01.590 --> 56:04.710
What's this one doing...
Oh, my lord!

56:05.910 --> 56:09.550
As the laps piled on, we slipped
further and further back.

56:11.310 --> 56:13.390
Third, second, third, fourth -
we're sixth, come on!

56:13.390 --> 56:16.310
- I know, I know, it's the weight.
- What do you mean, it's the weight?

56:16.310 --> 56:19.110
It's not my fault!
Matt kept pushing harder...

56:20.430 --> 56:22.190
Brake, brake.

56:22.190 --> 56:24.710
..but our chances didn't look good.

56:25.950 --> 56:27.750
We cannot come last!

56:27.750 --> 56:29.630
I'm doing my best!

56:33.950 --> 56:36.510
But, then, Chris stopped whining
and started helping...

56:37.670 --> 56:39.510
Up the inside of Rosie Racing.

56:39.510 --> 56:41.030
..and we started to fight back.

56:42.150 --> 56:43.190
I got him!

56:45.270 --> 56:47.070
One corner...

56:47.070 --> 56:49.150
Use all the circuit,
all the circuit.

56:49.150 --> 56:51.070
..and one 2CV at a time.

56:54.390 --> 56:56.230
OK, we're P4. P4.

56:57.790 --> 56:59.270
Heading into the final lap,

56:59.270 --> 57:01.230
we set our sights on a podium
finish.

57:02.990 --> 57:06.950
Standing in our way, the formidable
Jelly Snake Racing.

57:06.950 --> 57:08.510
What's a jelly snake?

57:11.630 --> 57:13.470
Come on, come on, come on!

57:13.470 --> 57:16.030
Don't give it up. Don't give it up!

57:16.030 --> 57:18.310
Down the middle,
down the middle, my son.

57:18.310 --> 57:19.990
Down the middle!

57:21.590 --> 57:23.150
We're third!

57:26.430 --> 57:28.350
Final corner, dude. P3.

57:29.830 --> 57:32.390
- Come on, come on. - We've got
a podium! We've got a podium!

57:39.950 --> 57:42.630
- That's not bad.
- That's more than not bad!

57:42.630 --> 57:45.310
Way to go, girl!
That was fantastic.

57:45.310 --> 57:48.190
That was really fun.
I love this car.

57:51.710 --> 57:54.950
So, there you go. The 2CV.

57:54.950 --> 57:56.630
Everybody loves it in the end.

57:58.350 --> 58:00.910
In a Ferrari, people hate you.

58:00.910 --> 58:04.430
They love the Ferrari,
but they hate you.

58:04.430 --> 58:06.910
In this, though,
people love the car,

58:06.910 --> 58:09.110
and they love you for driving it.

58:11.070 --> 58:14.110
This is a car
that makes people smile.

58:18.990 --> 58:22.950
- OK, I concede, you won me over.
- Isn't it just brilliant?

58:22.950 --> 58:26.110
It really is. And I've got
to say I want one.

58:26.110 --> 58:27.990
- How much is it? - About seven grand.

58:29.150 --> 58:32.230
Seven grand! Are you out of your
mind? Forget it.

58:32.230 --> 58:34.110
Seven grand!

58:42.910 --> 58:44.430
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

58:51.790 --> 58:56.910
So, both of you actually agree
that this heap of junk...

58:57.990 --> 58:59.910
..is a work of genius?

58:59.910 --> 59:01.270
Whoa, whoa, easy there.

59:01.270 --> 59:03.470
This is Chris's heap of junk.

59:03.470 --> 59:05.310
So, this is actually your car?

59:05.310 --> 59:07.470
- Oh, yes. - Why?

59:07.470 --> 59:10.630
I get it. It's refreshingly simple.

59:10.630 --> 59:12.750
It breaks down, you fix it.

59:12.750 --> 59:15.230
Gets a dent, you bash the dent out.

59:15.230 --> 59:17.630
You have, like, a real connection
with the car.

59:17.630 --> 59:20.630
I mean, I suppose so.
I mean, it's got potential.

59:20.630 --> 59:24.470
I could straighten out the bodywork,
wrap it, slam it.

59:24.470 --> 59:26.230
Throw on some dubs.

59:26.230 --> 59:28.230
- I could work with this. - Yeah, right?

59:28.230 --> 59:30.390
- Yeah. - Yeah.

59:30.390 --> 59:33.350
Just don't open the door,
it smells awful in there.

59:33.350 --> 59:36.510
I think it's the eggs and the,
what you call it, sheep dung.

59:37.630 --> 59:39.910
That's the joy of the 2CV, you see.

59:39.910 --> 59:42.430
I've given it a quick wash,
air freshener inside,

59:42.430 --> 59:44.430
it's as good as new.

59:46.430 --> 59:48.910
This is what it looked like
when it was new?

59:48.910 --> 59:50.110
LAUGHTER

59:50.110 --> 59:51.510
Ah, I still like it.

59:51.510 --> 59:53.350
All right, that's all
we have time for.

59:53.350 --> 59:55.910
Join us next week when we try
to speed up farming,

59:55.910 --> 59:58.590
and Sabine tries to speed up Rory.

59:58.590 --> 01:00:00.150
See you then. Goodnight.
