00:37.075 --> 00:39.210
Oh, I love going to aquatic parks.

00:39.277 --> 00:41.876
Sure, they have worse rides
than amusement parks,

00:41.944 --> 00:45.478
less fish than aquarium
s- but the parking is ample!

00:49.214 --> 00:51.647
Now to seal you in for safety.

00:54.517 --> 00:58.051
Oh, there's so many photo ops,

00:58.119 --> 01:00.586
but I already filled up my
camera in the parking lot.

01:00.654 --> 01:03.254
Parking lot C sign, the tram,

01:03.321 --> 01:04.821
a license plate from Canada,

01:04.888 --> 01:06.923
a bird eating potato chips,

01:06.990 --> 01:08.190
my feet walking,

01:08.257 --> 01:10.324
that boy who got sick on the tram,

01:10.392 --> 01:12.258
Grampa talking to a mermaid hedge,

01:12.326 --> 01:14.160
the park rules in Spanish,

01:14.228 --> 01:15.662
a fat baby,

01:15.730 --> 01:18.064
Grampa telling a story to a trailer hitch.

01:18.132 --> 01:20.700
Oops! I erased them all!

01:22.137 --> 01:23.604
I want to do that!

01:27.306 --> 01:29.007
I'm going to take stuff
from the lost and found!

01:34.545 --> 01:35.945
My feet hurt!

01:36.013 --> 01:37.614
left ear's freezing!

01:37.681 --> 01:39.114
My right ear's burning!

01:39.182 --> 01:41.150
I got fish smell in my wrinkles!

01:42.519 --> 01:44.686
Attention, exploro-nauts!

01:44.753 --> 01:45.853
That's us!

01:45.921 --> 01:47.620
In one minute, we'll be starting

01:47.688 --> 01:50.719
our rock-quatic roll-tacular!

01:50.787 --> 01:53.219
Hurry! If we don't get a
seat in the splash zone,

01:53.287 --> 01:55.722
I've worn my bathing suit
under my clothes for nothing!

01:55.789 --> 01:57.489
A splash-'em-up show?

01:57.557 --> 02:01.192
Reminds me of the time I hig
h-dived into a damp sponge

02:01.260 --> 02:04.930
for the amusement of Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.

02:04.998 --> 02:07.032
Grampa, no stories!

02:07.099 --> 02:09.832
You can come with us,
or sit here on the shark bench.

02:09.900 --> 02:12.333
You know, I did sit on a shark once....

02:12.400 --> 02:13.867
d, bathing suit!

02:15.436 --> 02:17.169
Oops! No bathing suit.

02:17.237 --> 02:18.403
* *

02:18.471 --> 02:20.271
Let's give a wet and wacky welcome

02:20.339 --> 02:23.374
to Springfield's oldest
performing mollusk...

02:23.441 --> 02:24.808
Get to the show!

02:24.876 --> 02:26.376
This is the show!

02:26.444 --> 02:29.712
Here's the original Octomom: Slimu!

02:33.115 --> 02:34.215
* Whoa! *

02:34.283 --> 02:36.217
* I feel good *

02:37.686 --> 02:38.619
* I knew that I would... *

02:38.686 --> 02:40.521
Slimu! Did you get my letters?

02:40.588 --> 02:42.656
Slimu wasn't expecting company,

02:42.723 --> 02:44.791
so he's got some cleaning up to do!

02:44.858 --> 02:47.459
*...I wouldn't now *

02:47.527 --> 02:49.160
* So good *

02:53.131 --> 02:55.232
Slimu looks kind of uncomfortable.

02:55.299 --> 02:57.300
Wouldn't you be if you were a saltwater fish

02:57.368 --> 02:59.436
in a freshwater aquarium?

02:59.503 --> 03:02.238
The country has its first black president.

03:02.306 --> 03:05.340
Maybe it's time for the
first octopus president!

03:08.744 --> 03:10.644
And when it comes to signing bills,

03:10.712 --> 03:12.546
he can provide his own ink!

03:14.749 --> 03:16.983
Ahh, oily!

03:20.053 --> 03:22.621
They'll cheer a dancing octopus,

03:22.689 --> 03:26.557
but not an old man
complaining about everything.

03:26.625 --> 03:28.859
Excuse me, sir. Is this seat taken?

03:28.927 --> 03:31.761
Well, not for a pretty girl like you!

03:33.765 --> 03:36.232
Well, this is the first
time I ever sat on a shark.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.634
Not me-- sat on a real one once!

03:38.702 --> 03:40.168
Tell me more! More?!

03:41.637 --> 03:43.070
<i>Play it cool, Grampa.</i>

03:43.138 --> 03:45.105
<i>Play it cool!</i>

03:45.173 --> 03:47.340
<i>It was back in World War II.</i>

03:47.408 --> 03:49.409
<i>I was a Seaman First Class</i>

03:49.476 --> 03:51.978
<i>on the USS World War I.</i>

03:52.045 --> 03:53.679
<i>We were minding our own business</i>

03:53.747 --> 03:56.248
<i>when we were attacked by a hea
t-seeking torpedo</i>

03:56.315 --> 03:59.083
<i>we had fired the day before.</i>

04:06.857 --> 04:08.624
Don't worry about the sharks, boys.

04:08.691 --> 04:11.559
Just play possum and
they'll leave you alone.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.894
<i>Unfortunately, sharks love possum.</i>

04:18.161 --> 04:21.396
Hey, boys, these sharks can't
bite us if we're on their backs!

04:21.463 --> 04:23.397
Yeah.

04:23.465 --> 04:26.299
It's like riding the Cyclone
back at Coney Island!

04:26.367 --> 04:27.633
Whoa!

04:27.701 --> 04:29.637
It's like riding a dust devil back in Yuma--

04:29.705 --> 04:32.307
like I read about in a book back in Boston!

04:32.375 --> 04:34.743
<i>By the time the rescue planes came,</i>

04:34.810 --> 04:37.343
<i>we had those sharks trained
pretty good.</i>

04:44.348 --> 04:47.050
I still keep in touch with all those men

04:47.118 --> 04:48.485
and some of the sharks.

04:48.553 --> 04:50.921
Why, here's us in Hawaii last year.

04:50.988 --> 04:53.689
Good times.

04:53.757 --> 04:55.791
Sir, my name is Marshall Goldman.

04:55.859 --> 04:57.726
I'm a newspaper columnist

04:57.794 --> 05:00.195
specializing in human interest stories.

05:00.263 --> 05:01.429
You're in the newspaper business?

05:02.798 --> 05:04.766
Something that's gonna die before I do!

05:04.833 --> 05:06.935
You have any other stories
you'd care to tell me?

05:07.003 --> 05:09.270
Someone's listening to me!

05:09.337 --> 05:12.773
Now I know how a radio feels!

05:14.342 --> 05:17.077
Well, class, it's Friday afternoon.

05:17.144 --> 05:19.410
That means it's time to find
out which one of you gets

05:19.478 --> 05:21.909
to take Larry the Lamb home for the weekend.

05:21.977 --> 05:22.843
Oh! Oh! Oh!

05:22.911 --> 05:24.076
And don't forget,

05:24.144 --> 05:26.379
the lucky student gets
to add his or her page

05:26.447 --> 05:28.313
to Larry's personal journal.

05:28.381 --> 05:31.082
Just like Martin did last week.

05:31.150 --> 05:32.150
Ha!

05:32.218 --> 05:34.219
I want him first! No, me!

05:34.287 --> 05:36.754
Oh, not that stupid stuffed lamb again.

05:36.822 --> 05:37.789
This isn't learning!

05:37.856 --> 05:39.157
Do you want to learn?

05:39.225 --> 05:40.958
No, no, no. I'm just saying...

05:41.026 --> 05:42.126
This weekend,

05:42.193 --> 05:45.029
Larry will go home with...

05:45.931 --> 05:47.465
Please, God, I need this.

05:47.533 --> 05:48.967
...Bart Simpson.

05:50.269 --> 05:52.537
Oh, cruel irony!

05:52.605 --> 05:54.973
Hey, the only thing I bring
home are notes to my parents,

05:55.041 --> 05:57.042
and those do not arrive
the way that they left.

05:57.110 --> 06:00.077
Hmm.

06:00.145 --> 06:02.979
Oh, what a nice note!

06:03.047 --> 06:05.581
I'm not sticking my hand in that can again.

06:05.649 --> 06:06.849
You're getting the lamb.

06:09.053 --> 06:11.355
Not so fast.

06:11.422 --> 06:14.158
Tell the diary how special
he makes you feel!

06:16.328 --> 06:19.264
More adjectives!

06:19.331 --> 06:20.698
That's an adverb!

06:30.340 --> 06:31.574
Top of the morning, Homer.

06:31.642 --> 06:32.675
Seen the paper?

06:32.743 --> 06:34.809
No, I get my news off the Internet.

06:36.977 --> 06:40.212
Well, sir, it looks like your
dad is a quotable notable.

06:40.279 --> 06:42.547
Huh?

06:42.615 --> 06:45.049
That's a... It's funny.

06:45.117 --> 06:46.584
It's poignant...

06:46.652 --> 06:47.819
It actually happened!

06:47.887 --> 06:49.988
My father is interesting?!

06:50.056 --> 06:52.391
The whole world's upside down!

06:52.458 --> 06:54.526
<i>That must mean Cathy is funny.</i>

06:54.593 --> 06:55.793
Nope.

06:57.328 --> 06:59.629
Abe, I never knew you were so full of...

06:59.697 --> 07:01.631
! What does that mean?

07:01.699 --> 07:02.998
It's like ,

07:03.066 --> 07:05.500
but with a pinch more !

07:05.568 --> 07:07.569
Yep, I may just be

07:07.636 --> 07:09.872
the best known Abraham in history.

07:09.940 --> 07:11.607
So, Abe, what else you got for me?

07:11.675 --> 07:13.442
Hmm, well, let's see.

07:13.510 --> 07:16.345
Ooh, I was working as a shoeshine boy

07:16.413 --> 07:19.247
at Springfield Union Station.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.079
* *

07:25.215 --> 07:28.216
<i>Every Monday, the Tinseltown
Starliner would stop</i>

07:28.284 --> 07:30.784
<i>at 1:17 p.m. on its way to Hollywood.</i>

07:30.852 --> 07:32.748
<i>I never rode that train,</i>

07:32.816 --> 07:35.218
<i>but I'd palaver with the movie stars</i>

07:35.285 --> 07:38.087
<i>when they got out to
stretch their legs.</i>

07:38.155 --> 07:39.988
Hiya!

07:57.938 --> 08:00.538
<i>But none was more memorable than...</i>

08:00.606 --> 08:01.706
Clark Gable!

08:01.774 --> 08:03.541
Looks like someone has seen my work

08:03.609 --> 08:05.376
<i>as an extra in Du Barry, Woman Of
Passion.</i>

08:05.444 --> 08:06.710
I sure have, Mr. Gable.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.778
How come you ain't a star yet?

08:08.846 --> 08:10.512
Maybe my ears are too big. I don't know.

08:12.215 --> 08:14.084
Hey, what you reading there? Oh, it's called

08:14.152 --> 08:15.654
<i>Gone with the Wind. You can have it.</i>

08:15.721 --> 08:18.091
It's only got one swear word,
and not a very good one.

08:18.159 --> 08:19.392
<i>Gone with the Wind, eh?</i>

08:19.460 --> 08:21.761
Well, let's see: garbage, garbage, my line.

08:21.829 --> 08:23.497
Garbage, garbage, my line.

08:23.564 --> 08:25.399
Atlanta burns, nice dresses. I like it!

08:25.466 --> 08:27.467
Thanks, kid.

08:27.535 --> 08:30.336
Don't tell this story
to anyone for 60 years.

08:32.438 --> 08:34.472
"Clark Gable owes me a book.

08:34.541 --> 08:36.575
"And he never paid me for the shoeshine.

08:36.643 --> 08:39.110
"But his big blue eyes could melt the butter

08:39.178 --> 08:40.845
"you kept in your pocket for lunch.

08:40.913 --> 08:42.647
Lunch butter we called it."

08:42.715 --> 08:45.783
How come Grampa never shared
those stories with us?

08:45.851 --> 08:47.184
He does all the time.

08:47.252 --> 08:48.352
You just never listen.

08:48.419 --> 08:50.620
Marge, my brain is like a computer,

08:50.688 --> 08:54.456
and I file away Grampa's stories
in a very special place.

08:59.228 --> 09:01.062
Hmm, while I'm up there.

09:10.371 --> 09:11.571
Uh-oh.

09:15.643 --> 09:17.476
That's it, boy! Go for the nards!

09:17.543 --> 09:18.810
Bart!

09:18.878 --> 09:20.512
If you're not gonna take care of him right,

09:20.579 --> 09:22.079
then give him to me.

09:22.147 --> 09:24.581
How come you don't get mad
when I torment real animals?

09:24.649 --> 09:26.949
I do! It enrages me!

09:27.017 --> 09:29.585
I thought you Hindus were
supposed to love everybody.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.188
I'm a freaking Buddhist!

09:31.256 --> 09:32.323
A Buddhist!

09:34.759 --> 09:37.594
Larry, please don't judge
our whole family by Bart.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.995
He's the black sheep.

09:39.062 --> 09:40.663
I mean, not that black sheep

09:40.731 --> 09:42.331
are in any way inferior to white sheep.

09:42.399 --> 09:43.933
I do not judge wool by its color--

09:44.000 --> 09:45.768
only by how itchy it is.

09:45.836 --> 09:46.902
Ooh, look!

09:46.970 --> 09:48.203
Jazz!

09:48.271 --> 09:51.272
Larry, what sub-genre of jazz do you like?

09:51.340 --> 09:52.940
Fusion? Neo-bop?

09:53.008 --> 09:54.308
Afro-Cuban?

09:55.877 --> 09:57.611
Larry!

09:57.678 --> 10:00.313
Gotcha!

10:01.815 --> 10:03.750
Larry? Oh, Larry?

10:03.817 --> 10:04.984
Larry?

10:05.051 --> 10:06.885
Larry?!

10:06.953 --> 10:10.455
You're coming off desperate, honey.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.892
That's how I got my idea
for a suitcase with wheels,

10:13.959 --> 10:16.662
from watching a commercial
about a suitcase with wheels.

10:17.731 --> 10:19.331
Hey, Abe,

10:19.399 --> 10:20.799
great stories.

10:20.867 --> 10:23.132
<i>I'm Mitch Albom, author of
Tuesdays with Morrie.</i>

10:23.200 --> 10:24.466
Never heard of you.

10:24.533 --> 10:26.001
Yeah. Sure you haven't.

10:26.068 --> 10:28.436
Take a hike, Hollywood.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.037
I've already got a college boy

10:30.105 --> 10:32.874
to turn my every word into syndicated gold.

10:32.941 --> 10:35.009
Yeah, beat it, sports page.

10:35.077 --> 10:37.679
And what if I don't?

10:49.554 --> 10:53.021
Clouds are God's sneezes.

10:53.089 --> 10:54.556
Ooh, I like this kid.

10:59.662 --> 11:02.530
Oh, Dad, I got you some Scotch.

11:02.598 --> 11:03.995
One of those fancy ones

11:04.063 --> 11:06.396
the checkout lady had to
unlock the cabinet to get.

11:06.463 --> 11:07.830
Well, well, well,

11:07.898 --> 11:10.965
look who decided to visit
me twice in one year.

11:11.032 --> 11:14.000
This man's more of a son to
me than you've ever been.

11:14.068 --> 11:15.668
What the...?!

11:15.736 --> 11:18.872
Well, he's more of a father
to me than you've ever been!

11:18.940 --> 11:20.341
I don't think that's true.

11:20.409 --> 11:21.376
Stay out of this, Dad.

11:21.444 --> 11:23.077
Uh, no. O-Okay.

11:23.145 --> 11:25.913
You only care about me
now because I'm famous.

11:25.981 --> 11:27.047
That's it.

11:27.115 --> 11:28.582
Here's your ring back.

11:28.649 --> 11:29.817
Ring? What ring?

11:29.884 --> 11:31.622
It's a father-son commitment band

11:31.690 --> 11:33.657
that I bought and never told you about.

11:38.295 --> 11:40.295
And now I'm telling you.

11:43.426 --> 11:45.860
Okay, I need the stupid lamb back.

11:45.928 --> 11:47.463
He's in here, safe and sound.

11:47.530 --> 11:49.467
Let me just staple that bag for you.

11:54.974 --> 11:56.741
Hmm.

11:56.809 --> 11:58.075
This isn't Larry.

11:58.142 --> 12:00.276
It's just cotton balls
on toilet paper rolls.

12:00.344 --> 12:01.444
Where's the real Larry?

12:01.511 --> 12:03.011
Well, what do you care?

12:03.079 --> 12:04.513
You don't even like him.

12:04.581 --> 12:06.781
<i>Of course I don't,
but other people do.</i>

12:06.849 --> 12:09.150
Hey, Bart, can't wait to see Larry again.

12:09.218 --> 12:12.786
Um, what if someone were to lose Larry?

12:12.854 --> 12:16.489
They'd see a dark side
of me no one knows about.

12:16.557 --> 12:18.557
* Nelson loved a little lamb *

12:18.625 --> 12:21.492
* Little lamb, little lamb *

12:21.560 --> 12:23.730
* Nelson loved a little lamb *

12:23.797 --> 12:26.766
* He kept me nice and sane. *

12:33.138 --> 12:34.238
You've reached Abe.

12:34.305 --> 12:35.606
And Marshall.

12:35.673 --> 12:37.874
Abe can't come to the phone right now.

12:37.942 --> 12:40.776
And if this is Homer,
you're too late for my love.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.245
Stupid Grampa.

12:43.313 --> 12:45.280
I try to end the cycle of neglect,

12:45.348 --> 12:47.382
and he hits me with some super neglect.

12:47.450 --> 12:49.551
Maybe you're not really mad at Grampa.

12:49.618 --> 12:51.052
Maybe you're mad at yourself

12:51.119 --> 12:53.554
for taking him for granted all these years.

12:53.622 --> 12:55.556
Marge, how can anyone be mad at himself?

12:55.624 --> 12:57.458
It's impossible. Watch.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.026
Why, you little...

12:59.094 --> 13:00.861
Oh, I can't.

13:00.929 --> 13:03.530
When I look at those
beautiful chubby cheeks.

13:03.598 --> 13:04.731
Come here, you.

13:04.799 --> 13:06.599
Ow!

13:06.667 --> 13:08.868
Ow! I'll kill you, you son of a...!

13:08.936 --> 13:10.804
Oh. No, no, don't-don't look hurt.

13:10.871 --> 13:12.138
Okay. It's okay.

13:12.206 --> 13:13.372
It's okay.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.974
I'll show Grampa.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.842
I'll find my own surrogate father

13:16.909 --> 13:19.908
full of heart-warming stories
I can share with the world.

13:19.976 --> 13:23.111
And that's how you win an opium war.

13:23.179 --> 13:25.113
Oh, great stuff.

13:25.181 --> 13:26.581
And the life lesson is?

13:26.649 --> 13:29.716
The Yangtze River swallows all secrets.

13:29.784 --> 13:31.084
Hmm.

13:31.152 --> 13:33.787
I'm just gonna put "Haste makes waste."

13:33.855 --> 13:37.023
Yes, although, these days,
I can make neither haste nor waste.

13:37.090 --> 13:38.524
You know, Simpson,

13:38.591 --> 13:40.525
this has truly been a lovely afternoon.

13:40.593 --> 13:42.527
Release... a hound.

13:43.728 --> 13:45.962
Isn't that cute?

13:46.030 --> 13:47.697
He thinks he's a pack.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.333
Where'd you get this rope?

13:52.401 --> 13:53.334
Swiped it from gym class.

13:53.402 --> 13:54.535
Climb that rope!

13:55.704 --> 13:58.239
There is no rope.

13:58.307 --> 14:00.240
Well, you better get to the ceiling somehow!

14:01.643 --> 14:03.143
Ceiling, ceiling, ceiling!

14:05.547 --> 14:07.214
Bart, I'm losing my grip.

14:07.282 --> 14:08.816
Put the rope in your teeth.

14:08.883 --> 14:10.350
What will that do?

14:10.418 --> 14:11.584
It'll shut you up.

14:13.687 --> 14:14.853
Hmm.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.153
Larry?

14:16.221 --> 14:18.821
Larry the Lamb?

14:18.889 --> 14:21.156
There you are, you piece of crap.

14:22.525 --> 14:24.391
There's rats in my pants!

14:24.459 --> 14:27.326
Chief, my brother fell in the storm drain!

14:27.394 --> 14:30.862
Um, I'm strictly an abov
e-the-ground policeman.

14:30.929 --> 14:32.596
What you need is the sewer cops.

14:32.664 --> 14:33.930
Fine. What's their number?

14:33.998 --> 14:35.198
Lisa, you're old enough now

14:35.265 --> 14:36.832
that I can tell you the truth.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.834
There's no such thing as the sewer cops.

14:38.902 --> 14:41.640
It's just something we tell
kids to make them feel safe.

14:41.708 --> 14:43.142
What about Bart?

14:43.210 --> 14:45.678
Well, if you miss him, yell into a toilet.

14:47.247 --> 14:49.148
BART : It's dark down here!

14:51.852 --> 14:54.721
I have a column I'd like to submit.

14:54.789 --> 14:56.090
Pay me whenever.

14:56.157 --> 14:57.925
I'll just take this to our editor.

15:02.358 --> 15:04.423
Hmm.

15:09.196 --> 15:11.098
What?

15:11.166 --> 15:14.802
Pulitzer Prize application form?

15:14.870 --> 15:18.671
<i>"When I rode with Abe Simpson on
t Tinseltown Starliner,</i>

15:18.739 --> 15:22.441
"I never dreamed his first
voyage would be his last?

15:22.509 --> 15:24.509
"At 3:00 on Monday,

15:24.577 --> 15:26.343
Abe passed away peacefully in his sleep."

15:29.079 --> 15:31.614
How would he know Grampa
was going to die today?

15:31.681 --> 15:34.951
Unless he was going to kill him!

15:35.018 --> 15:36.752
But would someone really kill a man

15:36.820 --> 15:38.854
just to win a Pulitzer Prize?

15:50.037 --> 15:53.638
<i>All aboard the final run of the Tinseltown
Starliner,</i>

15:53.706 --> 15:56.440
the last ride into a nostalgic past.

15:56.508 --> 15:58.542
Anyone without a ticket will be beaten

15:58.609 --> 16:00.243
by classic railroad bulls.

16:01.812 --> 16:04.013
* Old Dan Tucker was a fine old man *

16:04.080 --> 16:06.681
* He washed his face in the frying pan *

16:06.749 --> 16:08.483
* He combed his hair with a wagon wheel *

16:08.551 --> 16:11.085
* And died of the toothache in his heel. *

16:11.153 --> 16:12.987
You don't get a beatin' like
this traveling by plane.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.255
Ow!

16:14.323 --> 16:17.125
<i>I'm finally riding the Tinseltown
Starliner.</i>

16:17.193 --> 16:19.594
I could die a happy man.

16:33.072 --> 16:35.306
D'oh!

16:36.941 --> 16:38.308
Drink up, Abe.

16:38.375 --> 16:40.576
Live each moment as if
someone's about to kill you.

16:40.643 --> 16:41.777
I mean,

16:41.844 --> 16:43.778
as if it's your last.

16:43.846 --> 16:46.013
Sorry, my hearing aid's on the fritz.

16:46.081 --> 16:48.749
The only word I heard was "kill."

16:52.789 --> 16:54.491
Hey. Aah.

16:55.660 --> 16:56.760
Look at that.

16:56.828 --> 16:58.929
They've recreated the '30s.

16:58.996 --> 17:01.564
Tent cities, failing banks.

17:01.631 --> 17:02.865
No, those are real.

17:06.336 --> 17:07.836
Oh!

17:07.904 --> 17:09.503
Beware of Marshall Goldman!

17:09.571 --> 17:11.071
What was that?

17:11.140 --> 17:13.308
Um, an elephant on a circus train

17:13.375 --> 17:14.709
bellowing for his mother.

17:14.777 --> 17:17.311
Oh, I remember the first time

17:17.378 --> 17:20.247
an elephant tried to eat me like a peanut.

17:20.315 --> 17:23.317
I was on the set of a
Warner Brothers cartoon.

17:23.385 --> 17:25.219
Jack Warner came by and said...

17:28.222 --> 17:29.956
Hey, Slimu!

17:31.291 --> 17:33.960
Huh?

17:35.362 --> 17:37.430
Yeah, you'd better run!

17:38.798 --> 17:40.032
Sewer cats!

17:43.734 --> 17:45.001
Larry?!

17:47.537 --> 17:49.205
Larry, you saved my life!

17:49.273 --> 17:51.707
You're the most wonderful
stuffed lamb in the world.

17:51.775 --> 17:53.041
I'm sorry about the mean things I said,

17:53.109 --> 17:54.976
and we'll have the rest of the weekend to...

17:55.044 --> 17:56.744
Whoa!

17:58.247 --> 17:59.780
Huh?

17:59.848 --> 18:01.482
Larry!

18:02.750 --> 18:04.651
Man, everybody loves this guy.

18:04.718 --> 18:05.718
Give him my number.

18:05.786 --> 18:06.986
I'll teach him things.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.921
Things he can use.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.192
The older I get,

18:14.260 --> 18:17.027
the more I like the taste of hot water.

18:18.730 --> 18:21.231
* Here comes the prize *

18:21.299 --> 18:22.933
* Pulitzer Prize *

18:23.001 --> 18:26.303
* I'll finally be successful
in my mother's eyes. *

18:28.004 --> 18:29.070
A little ler...

18:29.138 --> 18:30.271
little lower.

18:30.339 --> 18:32.574
Drop that pillow!

18:34.410 --> 18:37.044
It gets worse.

18:37.112 --> 18:38.645
Ow! Yeah.

18:40.348 --> 18:42.415
See you tomorrow at yoga.

18:42.483 --> 18:44.083
Jane is sick, so Tricia's filling in.

18:44.151 --> 18:46.518
As long as it's not a du!

18:55.728 --> 18:58.262
How can you stand up to this punishment?

18:58.329 --> 19:00.896
I'm the toughest S.O.B. there is--

19:00.964 --> 19:03.898
a biweekly human interest columnist.

19:03.966 --> 19:06.733
And your father's gonna make me a fortune.

19:06.801 --> 19:08.801
Pathetic old fool.

19:08.869 --> 19:11.603
Maybe so, but I know how to play possum.

19:11.671 --> 19:12.771
Um...

19:20.145 --> 19:23.046
So many hat boxes.

19:25.183 --> 19:27.017
Dad, I don't have the right words

19:27.085 --> 19:29.152
to say how I really feel about you,

19:29.220 --> 19:32.586
but at least I know how
to beat up a guy who does.

19:32.654 --> 19:35.689
Well, at least you never tried to kill me.

19:35.757 --> 19:37.824
Just with indifference.

19:39.126 --> 19:40.460
You did good, kid.

19:40.528 --> 19:42.562
This is for the shoeshine.

19:42.630 --> 19:43.863
It's a ghost quarter,

19:43.931 --> 19:45.531
but you'll be able to spend it pretty soon.

19:47.334 --> 19:49.902
So, Grampa, you really saved Dad's life?

19:49.970 --> 19:51.537
I sure did.

19:51.605 --> 19:54.173
But why don't we let Homer tell the story?

19:54.240 --> 19:56.574
Really? Me? u mean it?

19:56.642 --> 19:59.510
I think you're ready for your first ramble.

19:59.578 --> 20:02.112
Oh, I've been waiting for
this day for so long.

20:02.179 --> 20:04.514
The year is 1946.

20:04.582 --> 20:07.984
In a war-torn world, a single flower blooms.

20:08.052 --> 20:11.687
And that flower is an angry
Japanese monster named Godzilla.

20:11.755 --> 20:13.121
How am I doing, Dad?

20:13.189 --> 20:15.656
I'm hanging on every word.

20:15.723 --> 20:18.124
Fortunately, there was
one man who could help--

20:18.192 --> 20:19.893
Colonel Tom Parker.

20:19.961 --> 20:22.529
The Colonel took this monster,
cleaned him up

20:22.596 --> 20:24.397
and put him onstage under the name

20:24.465 --> 20:26.232
The Rolling Stones.

20:26.300 --> 20:27.933
The first concert was a sellout

20:28.001 --> 20:30.602
with many, many, many people eaten.

20:30.669 --> 20:34.539
But those that survived raved
about the undeniable harmonies

20:34.607 --> 20:37.843
and brutally honest lyrics
of what they had just seen.

20:37.911 --> 20:41.346
<i>And that lasted for about five years.</i>

20:41.414 --> 20:46.416
<i>But then, Godzilla dropped out for a while
to do movies,</i>

20:46.484 --> 20:49.620
<i>all of the awful movies
we see now today</i>

20:49.687 --> 20:52.256
<i>in the driv
e-ins that no longer exist.</i>

21:24.150 --> 21:25.417
Shh!
