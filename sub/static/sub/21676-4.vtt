00:12.999 --> 00:13.999
- Previously on		 Below Deck...

00:14.000 --> 00:15.999
- Mr. Slover.

00:15.999 --> 00:16.999
- Oh, my Gosh.
I'm so excited.

00:16.999 --> 00:18.999
- It's your charter guest
soulmate.

00:18.999 --> 00:20.999
- A mermaid tail?
Where did that come from?

00:20.999 --> 00:21.999
I have a dope mermaid costume.

00:21.999 --> 00:23.999
Of course
I brought my mermaid tail.

00:23.999 --> 00:24.999
You can't--I don't travel--
It's like,

00:24.999 --> 00:25.999
my passport, my bikini,

00:25.999 --> 00:27.999
and my mermaid tail.

00:27.999 --> 00:30.999
- Rocky wouldn't even
take the covers off the bed.

00:30.999 --> 00:32.999
It's called
"turndown" for a reason.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
The clue is in the name.

00:34.999 --> 00:35.999
- Entertain me.

00:35.999 --> 00:37.999
Emile just freaking left me.

00:37.999 --> 00:40.000
Emile!

00:40.999 --> 00:43.999
Does he have a chance
to get a little smoochy-smooch?

00:43.999 --> 00:45.999
Only if he could play
Smooth Operator.

00:45.999 --> 00:46.999
- Whoo!
You gonna swim with us?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.999
- Yeah, I'm just gonna hop
in for a dip.

00:48.999 --> 00:50.999
All I see
is those pretty butt cheeks,

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
and I follow like a dog in heat.

00:54.999 --> 00:56.999
- Can you do me a favor

00:56.999 --> 00:58.999
and, uh, hop out
as quickly as you hopped in?

00:58.999 --> 01:01.999
Come up to the bridge please.
- Advice?

01:01.999 --> 01:02.999
- Honesty.
Don't get defensive.

01:02.999 --> 01:05.999
Captain likes people
to just smile and nod.

01:05.999 --> 01:06.999
- I'm want have a chat
with you.

01:06.999 --> 01:07.999
- I'm just--
I'm a little confused.

01:07.999 --> 01:09.999
I mean, you really think

01:09.999 --> 01:10.999
that I really haven't
been pulling my weight?

01:10.999 --> 01:12.999
- Why the fááá would you
talk back to the captain?

01:33.999 --> 01:34.999
- I don't want
to have these conversations.

01:34.999 --> 01:37.999
I don't like them.
I'm sure you don't like them.

01:37.999 --> 01:40.999
All I need you to do
is your job.

01:42.999 --> 01:44.999
- I don't think this scenario's
gonna be good for me,

01:44.999 --> 01:45.999
and I think at this point

01:45.999 --> 01:47.999
I'll have to give you
my notice of that.

01:47.999 --> 01:49.999
- Wait, what?

01:49.999 --> 01:50.999
Did you just actually quit?

01:50.999 --> 01:53.999
- I'm sorry.

01:53.999 --> 01:54.999
- It is what it is.
- It is what it is.

01:54.999 --> 01:56.999
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:56.999 --> 01:59.999
Call him a tender
and get him off here.

01:59.999 --> 02:00.999
- Okay.

02:03.999 --> 02:04.999
- Go ahead
and keep ironing everything

02:04.999 --> 02:05.999
that needs to be ironed,

02:05.999 --> 02:07.999
and if it needs
to be touched up, I'll--

02:07.999 --> 02:09.999
- How are you?
- Ugh...

Outside.

02:16.999 --> 02:18.999
- What?

02:20.999 --> 02:22.999
What'd he mean?
- He quit.

02:22.999 --> 02:23.999
- Huh.
- Yeah.

02:23.999 --> 02:25.999
- Wow.

02:25.999 --> 02:29.999
- What's going on?
- Oh, fááá me.

02:29.999 --> 02:31.999
So I went for a swim.
It was all harmless.

02:31.999 --> 02:33.000
I came back within two minutes,
and I got right back to my job,

02:33.000 --> 02:34.999
and then he goes into
this whole thing about my work

02:34.999 --> 02:36.999
and how when he sees me,
I'm not working,

02:36.999 --> 02:38.999
but everything else--
I have a logbook of all the jobs

02:38.999 --> 02:40.999
that I've done
and what I've been doing.

02:40.999 --> 02:41.999
I've done every part of it,

02:41.999 --> 02:42.999
and I even had a smile
on my face.

02:42.999 --> 02:44.000
So for somebody to make
that comment, that was it.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.999
And I sat there,
and I said, "Look, thank you,

02:45.999 --> 02:47.999
but this isn't right.
I can't do this."

02:47.999 --> 02:49.999
- If you can already tell
that this is not for you,

02:49.999 --> 02:56.999
I think it's wise and brave
to know that and accept it.

02:56.999 --> 02:59.999
You know, I love Don.
He's really great at his job.

02:59.999 --> 03:00.999
Unfortunately,
that's not the job

03:00.999 --> 03:02.999
this boat requires from him,

03:02.999 --> 03:04.999
and he wasn't able
to adapt to that.

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
Sometimes leaving something
that isn't right for you

03:06.999 --> 03:08.999
is not giving up--

03:08.999 --> 03:11.999
it's knowing when to hold them
and when to fold them.

03:11.999 --> 03:12.999
- This is one job
you can't half-ass,

03:13.000 --> 03:14.999
and that's why I get so upset.

03:14.999 --> 03:16.999
- Yachting's hard.
- No, it's not.

03:16.999 --> 03:18.999
Not when you find the right boat
with the right crew.

03:18.999 --> 03:19.999
Not when you throw
all of this on the mix...

03:19.999 --> 03:21.999
- Yeah. When you find that,
you just let me know,

03:21.999 --> 03:23.999
'cause I've been looking
for that for a long time.

03:28.999 --> 03:30.999
- What can I get you all?
- Shots.

03:30.999 --> 03:31.999
- I have tequila
for you guys.

03:31.999 --> 03:33.999
- You put pineapple,
though.

03:33.999 --> 03:34.999
- That'd be delicious.
- Great idea--that's a very

03:34.999 --> 03:35.999
good idea.
- Okay.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.999
- Don't let the primary
out of your sight.

03:37.999 --> 03:39.999
- Yeah. Keep watch
over the primary.

03:39.999 --> 03:42.999
- He's very delicate.

03:42.999 --> 03:44.999
- Did you hear what's gone on
in the last 20 minutes?

03:44.999 --> 03:46.999
- Lobsters have come in?

03:46.999 --> 03:47.999
- [laughs] Yeah.

03:47.999 --> 03:48.999
Don quit.

03:48.999 --> 03:50.999
- Donnie quit?
- Yeah.

03:50.999 --> 03:51.999
- What did you just say?

03:51.999 --> 03:54.000
- Captain called Donnie
into the wheelhouse,

03:54.999 --> 03:56.999
and apparently he quit.

03:58.999 --> 04:00.999
- Halle-freaking-llueha,

04:00.999 --> 04:03.999
'cause
you suck anyways, Don.

04:03.999 --> 04:06.999
But at the same time,
holy sháá.

04:06.999 --> 04:08.999
That's, like,
a whole person we're missing.

04:08.999 --> 04:09.999
Like, we have a lot to do.

04:11.999 --> 04:14.999
I don't believe in quitting.
I'm not a quitter.

04:14.999 --> 04:16.999
I thought
he would have more pride,

04:16.999 --> 04:19.999
but if you're gonna argue
with everybody on the boat,

04:19.999 --> 04:21.999
just as well pack your bags.

04:30.999 --> 04:31.999
- That's it?
- I think that's it, yeah.

04:36.999 --> 04:38.999
- If you leave any thing here,
just let me know,

04:38.999 --> 04:40.999
and I'll get it to you.
- I don't know.

04:40.999 --> 04:41.999
Maybe I jumped the gun,

04:41.999 --> 04:43.999
but how can I work for a guy
when he's gonna

04:43.999 --> 04:45.999
give me a hard time for doing
a back flip in the water?

04:51.999 --> 04:52.999
- Good luck, buddy, all right?
- I'll miss you guys.

04:52.999 --> 04:53.999
- Good luck.
- Yeah, for sure.

04:53.999 --> 04:55.999
- Bye, Don.
- Aah! Gonna miss you.

04:55.999 --> 04:59.999
An engineer and a captain have
to have the best relationship.

04:59.999 --> 05:00.999
You have to have somebody
you can communicate with.

05:00.999 --> 05:03.999
So for him to call me out
for that incident,

05:03.999 --> 05:04.999
are you fáááing kidding me?

05:07.999 --> 05:10.999
- Let's get back to work.

05:14.999 --> 05:16.999
- Can I get you something
to drink?

05:16.999 --> 05:17.999
- I would love a cocktail.

05:17.999 --> 05:20.999
How about a cosmo?
Shaken, hard, icy light pink?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.999
- I make a pretty good cosmo.
- Yeah, okay.

05:22.999 --> 05:24.999
- Our job as yachties
is to never let the guests

05:24.999 --> 05:26.999
know when there's a problem,

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
especially if that guest
is Dean Slover.

05:28.999 --> 05:30.999
- Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers.

05:38.999 --> 05:41.999
- See, that looks good.
- That looks a lot better.

05:41.999 --> 05:43.999
- Don's fáááing gone,
and Emile works so hard.

05:43.999 --> 05:45.999
Connie works so hard.

05:45.999 --> 05:46.999
We're getting
it done without Don,

05:46.999 --> 05:47.999
and we're getting
it done better.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.999
- If he argues
with the captain...

05:49.999 --> 05:52.999
- Yeah.
That's over the line.

05:52.999 --> 05:53.999
- He should've
known better.

05:53.999 --> 05:55.999
- Over the fáááing line,
Donnie.

05:55.999 --> 05:56.999
[laughter]

05:56.999 --> 05:58.999
- How's this morning
going?

05:58.999 --> 06:00.999
- Really well.
- It did?

06:00.999 --> 06:04.999
- So if we were,
like, stranded on this island

06:04.999 --> 06:05.999
and you had to pick one person,
who would it be?

06:07.999 --> 06:09.999
Who did you pick?

06:09.999 --> 06:10.999
- [whispers] I like Emile
'cause he's nice.

06:10.999 --> 06:12.999
- Emile?
- Check this out.

06:12.999 --> 06:13.999
But I don't like how how--

06:13.999 --> 06:15.999
Emile.
- Emile.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
- Emile.
- What's up? Do you want Emile?

06:17.999 --> 06:19.999
[laughing]

06:19.999 --> 06:21.999
- Emile's cute.
He's such a gentleman.

06:21.999 --> 06:24.999
He's really nice,
but he's young and immature,

06:24.999 --> 06:26.999
and...
not that that's a bad thing.

06:26.999 --> 06:29.999
Emile, you got a lot
going for you.

06:29.999 --> 06:31.000
- Oh, you've got a lot
going for you.

06:31.999 --> 06:34.999
- You are so close
to just hitting the ball

06:34.999 --> 06:38.999
out of the park, and all you
got to do is look at the ball.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
You got to sink that hook in.

06:40.999 --> 06:42.999
You got to get that hook
in there and really get it in.

06:42.999 --> 06:44.999
And guess where you're looking?
- Think about the ball.

06:44.999 --> 06:46.999
- Guess where you're looking?
Guess where you're looking?

06:46.999 --> 06:48.999
- Down--he's looking down.
- In the stands.

06:48.999 --> 06:50.999
Oh, he's looking down.
Oh, yeah, he's looking down.

06:50.999 --> 06:52.999
All he has to do is run home,
and he can't do it.

06:52.999 --> 06:54.999
Maybe I'm supposed
to show him what's up.

06:54.999 --> 06:56.999
I need a nicer--
I need more of a gentleman,

06:56.999 --> 06:58.999
and Eddie has what it takes.

06:58.999 --> 07:01.999
Not Eddie. See,
now I'm thinking about Eddie.

07:01.999 --> 07:02.999
Eddie.
Oh, I forgot about Eddie.

07:02.999 --> 07:04.999
- No, Eddie's out.
- No, Eddie's not--

07:04.999 --> 07:05.999
- Sorry.
- I want Eddie.

07:05.999 --> 07:07.999
I want Eddie so bad.
- No, Eddie's out.

07:07.999 --> 07:08.999
- I want Eddie so bad.
- You can't.

07:08.999 --> 07:11.999
- No, seriously, if Eddie didn't
have a girlfriend, it'd be on.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.999
- Yes.
- Eddie is the one.

07:14.999 --> 07:15.999
- Cheers!
- Bon appetit.

07:15.999 --> 07:18.999
- How many boats
have you worked on?

07:18.999 --> 07:20.999
You're really good.
- Oh, thank you.

07:20.999 --> 07:22.999
I think somewhere around 16?

07:22.999 --> 07:24.999
- When did you start
indulging blanket origami?

07:24.999 --> 07:27.999
- When I met you all.
- Fantastic.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
- So did that totally bore you?
Did you have a nice time?

07:29.999 --> 07:31.999
- I had a great time
lobster diving.

07:31.999 --> 07:33.999
- I like a spectator sport.

07:33.999 --> 07:36.999
- I do want to see a dive-off
between the staff.

07:36.999 --> 07:37.999
- Dean's chartered a lot
of yachts,

07:37.999 --> 07:40.999
so just being on the boat
isn't a novelty for him.

07:40.999 --> 07:43.999
- If we can arrange a dive-off,
I've got $500 to the winner.

07:43.999 --> 07:44.999
You arrange the time

07:44.999 --> 07:46.999
and every thing else...
- Certainly.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.999
- And we're on for a dive-off.
- Amazing.

07:48.999 --> 07:49.999
If he wants a dive-off,

07:49.999 --> 07:51.999
we'll give him a dive-off.

07:51.999 --> 07:54.999
- The guy with the tats
can back flip off the top.

07:54.999 --> 07:56.999
I'd really like to see that.
- Um, the guy with the tats,

07:56.999 --> 07:58.999
I'm not sure he's gonna
win this competition.

07:58.999 --> 08:00.999
Because he's gone.

08:00.999 --> 08:01.999
- Aye, Captain.

08:01.999 --> 08:05.999
So do you propose a crew
dive-off the boat competition,

08:05.999 --> 08:09.999
and he said "I will give $500
to the winner."

08:09.999 --> 08:11.999
- It's like,
"Dance, monkeys, dance.

08:11.999 --> 08:13.999
"Jump, monkeys, jump!

08:13.999 --> 08:15.999
Dive.
Go."

08:15.999 --> 08:18.999
- There are no depths

08:18.999 --> 08:20.999
to which we will not sink

08:20.999 --> 08:22.999
to get a good tip.

08:22.999 --> 08:26.999
- He might be paying
for, you know, freestyle.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
You know, it doesn't have to be
technical, but get creative.

08:28.999 --> 08:30.999
Maybe wear your tutu?
I'm gonna make scorecards.

08:30.999 --> 08:32.999
- So Dean's giving me $500?

08:32.999 --> 08:37.999
A diving contest, which means
I got to bring out the big guns.

08:37.999 --> 08:39.999
I was a junior Olympic diver.

08:39.999 --> 08:41.999
Can you still do it?
I don't know.

08:41.999 --> 08:42.999
- Have you guys seen
any more mustaches anywhere?

08:42.999 --> 08:44.000
- Here's one.

08:44.999 --> 08:47.999
- Yes. Eduardo Lopez
is here to play!

08:47.999 --> 08:49.999
- Oh.
- Oh...ha ha ha ha!

08:49.999 --> 08:52.999
Drinking tequila.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.999
- They're all changing
into their diving uniforms.

08:54.999 --> 08:57.999
- Yes.
- I had to pull out my best,

08:57.999 --> 09:00.999
which would be
my shark one-piece and my tutu.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.999
But really
I would rather go naked.

09:04.999 --> 09:06.999
- I like to compete.
I'm a competitive person,

09:06.999 --> 09:09.999
but honestly,
I'm a little afraid of heights.

09:09.999 --> 09:11.999
- Well, if it's $500,
I'm gonna bring out the pink.

09:11.999 --> 09:14.999
I'm gonna bring out my tricks,
and I'm gonna win.

09:14.999 --> 09:15.999
- This diving competition,
it's not me.

09:15.999 --> 09:18.999
Sorry, no way, Jose.

09:18.999 --> 09:20.999
- Oh, I'm so excited
for this.

09:20.999 --> 09:22.999
- You know, you have to judge
the whole thing.

09:22.999 --> 09:23.999
Presentation...

09:23.999 --> 09:25.999
- Guess this is it.
- Oh, my God.

09:25.999 --> 09:26.999
- Personality...

09:26.999 --> 09:27.999
[rattling]

09:27.999 --> 09:29.999
[toot]

09:29.999 --> 09:30.999
Performance...

09:34.999 --> 09:35.999
- The whole thing.

09:35.999 --> 09:36.999
- Oh.

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
- What?
- Look wise.

09:40.999 --> 09:41.999
- I want this $500.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.999
- He knows what numbers
he's picking,

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
so he's writing his number.

09:45.999 --> 09:48.999
- What are you doing now?
- I'm getting my diving suit on.

09:48.999 --> 09:50.999
I don't want to get my hair wet.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.999
- You know how many hair
dryers you can buy with $500?

09:52.999 --> 09:54.999
- Do you know how much time
I don't have?

09:54.999 --> 09:56.999
Guests always think
it's gonna be so fun

09:56.999 --> 09:57.999
to have the crew join in,

09:57.999 --> 10:00.999
but we have plenty
of other work to do,

10:00.999 --> 10:02.999
so the Gumby suit is kind
of like, "I'll do what you want,

10:02.999 --> 10:04.999
but I'm not gonna mess
up my hair."

10:04.999 --> 10:07.999
- You look so, so awkward.
[laughter]

10:07.999 --> 10:09.999
Kate, you're gonna win.
Ugh.

10:09.999 --> 10:12.999
[chatter, laughter]

10:12.999 --> 10:13.999
- Are they not diving
off the top-top?

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
- Off the bow.
- Oh, off the bow.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
- Yes.

10:17.999 --> 10:18.999
- All right, sports fans,

10:19.000 --> 10:23.999
welcome to the first annual
comedy Eros dive competition.

10:23.999 --> 10:27.999
First up we have Amy "Captain
in Spirit Team" Johnson.

10:27.999 --> 10:28.999
all: Whoo!

10:28.999 --> 10:30.999
- The things
we do for our charter guests.

10:30.999 --> 10:31.999
Team Dean!

10:31.999 --> 10:32.999
[indistinct chatter]

10:34.999 --> 10:36.999
- Hey.
- All right.

10:36.999 --> 10:38.999
- Yeah! Whoo!

10:38.999 --> 10:41.999
[guests cheering]

10:41.999 --> 10:43.999
- I want to get this over

10:43.999 --> 10:44.999
with as quick as possible
without breaking my neck.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.999
Team Dean!
Oh, my--

10:47.999 --> 10:50.999
Whoo!

10:50.999 --> 10:51.999
- Oh, no.

10:52.999 --> 10:53.999
- Hey, what's up?

10:53.999 --> 10:55.999
[giggling]

10:57.000 --> 10:58.999
[both laughing]

11:03.999 --> 11:05.999
- Amy!
- Amy!

11:05.999 --> 11:07.999
[cheering, whistles]

11:07.999 --> 11:11.999
- I want to get this over
with as quick as possible

11:11.999 --> 11:12.999
without breaking my neck.

11:12.999 --> 11:14.999
Team Dean!
Oh, my--

11:15.000 --> 11:17.999
Whoo!

11:18.999 --> 11:20.999
- Oh, no.
- Oh, that was---

11:20.999 --> 11:22.999
- Oh, my God,
the robe, the robe.

11:22.999 --> 11:23.999
- The robe!
- Whoo!

11:23.999 --> 11:25.999
- Yeah.

11:27.999 --> 11:30.999
- Next up we have
Connie "Shark Tank" Arias.

11:30.999 --> 11:33.999
- Aw, yeah.

11:36.999 --> 11:38.999
[overlapping whooping]

11:38.999 --> 11:39.999
- Oh, that was awesome.

11:39.999 --> 11:43.999
- She is Kate "Don't get
my hair wet" Chastain.

11:43.999 --> 11:47.999
[laughter]

11:47.999 --> 11:48.999
- Gonna hit that water
like a brick.

11:48.999 --> 11:52.999
[overlapping chatter,
laughter]

11:52.999 --> 11:53.999
- Hurry up!

11:53.999 --> 11:55.999
- Here we go.
- Whoo!

11:55.999 --> 11:57.999
- Oh!

11:57.999 --> 11:58.999
[laughter]

11:58.999 --> 12:00.999
- Solid 8!

12:00.999 --> 12:01.999
Yeah!

12:06.999 --> 12:09.999
- I love a good competition.

12:09.999 --> 12:10.999
- Next up we have

12:10.999 --> 12:13.999
Emile "The real deal"
Kotze!

12:13.999 --> 12:16.999
and his member.

12:16.999 --> 12:18.999
- If these are real pros,
I'm competitive.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.000
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

12:23.999 --> 12:26.999
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

12:26.999 --> 12:29.999
- Call me--and then
go put "call me."

12:29.999 --> 12:31.999
- We appreciate
the effort.

12:31.999 --> 12:32.999
- Oh.

12:32.999 --> 12:35.999
- Eduardo "Dirty Sanchez"
Lucas.

12:35.999 --> 12:36.999
- Yeah!

12:36.999 --> 12:40.999
- [ululating]

12:42.000 --> 12:44.999
- Yeah!

12:44.999 --> 12:46.999
Yeah!
Yeah!

12:46.999 --> 12:47.999
- Bet that's gonna leave a mark.

12:47.999 --> 12:50.999
- Yes. That's amazing.

12:50.999 --> 12:53.999
- Next up we have
Rocky "The Rocket" Dakota.

12:55.999 --> 12:59.999
all: Rocky. Rocky. Rocky.
- Whoo!

12:59.999 --> 13:01.999
- Oh, yeah.

13:01.999 --> 13:04.999
Oh, yeah.
- all: Whoo!

13:04.999 --> 13:05.999
all: Rocky!

13:05.999 --> 13:08.999
- all: Ah!

13:08.999 --> 13:12.999
[all chanting]
Rocky, Rocky, Rocky...

13:12.999 --> 13:14.999
Oh!
[loud cheering]

13:14.999 --> 13:17.999
- Yes. Yes!

13:17.999 --> 13:19.000
- Okay, let's give a big round
of applause

13:19.000 --> 13:22.999
to our honorable
and esteemed judges.

13:22.999 --> 13:23.999
It was a great idea.

13:23.999 --> 13:25.999
Everybody had a lot of fun
with it.

13:25.999 --> 13:27.999
I don't think I've ever seen
the crew and the guests

13:27.999 --> 13:30.999
laugh so hard simultaneously.

13:30.999 --> 13:31.999
- Well played.

13:41.999 --> 13:44.999
- Uh, Dean wanted to do
an award ceremony.

13:44.999 --> 13:46.999
- This is the perfect thing
for this charter.

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
He wants to have
an awards ceremony.

13:48.999 --> 13:52.000
It goes with my swim platform
evening cocktails idea.

13:53.999 --> 13:54.999
- Nippers.
- Nippers, okay.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.999
- Yeah.
- All right,

13:56.999 --> 13:57.999
so we're gonna have one drink.

13:57.999 --> 14:00.999
Then we'll come back, shower up,
get dressed for dinner.

14:00.999 --> 14:04.000
- The Greek party is perfect
for Dean because it's togas.

14:04.999 --> 14:06.999
It's headbands.

14:06.999 --> 14:08.999
- We'll plan a party
around 8:00, 8:30?

14:08.999 --> 14:09.999
- I love it. I love it.
- Okay.

14:09.999 --> 14:11.999
- Award ceremony before dinner,
is that all right?

14:11.999 --> 14:12.999
- That'd be great. Love that.
- Okay.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.999
Have fun.
- Thank you.

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
- Hey, Emile, why don't you
go take a break

14:16.999 --> 14:18.999
while the guests
are off the boat?

14:18.999 --> 14:19.999
- Whoop-whoop.

14:19.999 --> 14:22.999
- Hey, Amy. Kate.
- Go ahead.

14:22.999 --> 14:23.999
- Can you come to the main salon
real quick?

14:23.999 --> 14:26.000
The guests are only going for
one drink and then coming back,

14:26.999 --> 14:27.999
so we need to get the costumes
in their room.

14:27.999 --> 14:28.999
- I'll be right down.

14:28.999 --> 14:30.999
- Let's go.
- All right, we're good to go.

14:30.999 --> 14:32.999
Let's go.
- Nippers, here we come.

14:32.999 --> 14:33.999
- Hey, Rocky,
the guests are away.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
I guess you can go ahead and
take your 30-minute break now.

14:37.999 --> 14:38.999
- It's gorgeous!

14:41.999 --> 14:43.999
- Nippers drinks all around.

14:43.999 --> 14:45.999
Cheers, guys.
- To a beautiful trip.

14:47.999 --> 14:48.999
- You might have

14:48.999 --> 14:50.999
to cut these cheap tablecloths
to make two togas.

14:50.999 --> 14:52.999
- But here's the question,
do we cut it

14:52.999 --> 14:53.999
halfway the long-ways down

14:53.999 --> 14:55.999
so it just kind of drapes
over them and then it's belted?

14:55.999 --> 14:57.999
- Like a sash?
- I always love a good party,

14:57.999 --> 14:59.999
and especially
when there's costumes and themes

14:59.999 --> 15:02.999
and it's Grecian.
Like, hello.

15:02.999 --> 15:03.999
Our boat name is	 Eros.

15:03.999 --> 15:06.999
- Oh, God, we have to make
a lighting bolt so fast.

15:06.999 --> 15:08.000
- Like, pinned on a shirt
or something?

15:08.999 --> 15:09.999
- No, he's gonna carry it

15:09.999 --> 15:10.999
so that he can strike people
down with it.

15:10.999 --> 15:11.999
- Oh!

15:14.999 --> 15:16.999
- Hey, what's up?
- Nothing.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.999
I've got,
like, 20 minutes left.

15:18.999 --> 15:21.999
[giggling]

15:21.999 --> 15:22.999
- We need a bowl.

15:22.999 --> 15:24.999
- I think there's a bunch
on the crew mess coffee table.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.999
- I'll see if
I can find it.

15:28.999 --> 15:32.999
Hard. None of this girly, like,
"Oh, I want to pet you."

15:32.999 --> 15:34.999
If you're gonna pet me,
then pet me.

15:34.999 --> 15:36.999
You're gonna rub, rub.

15:36.999 --> 15:39.999
I've had three boyfriends
in my entire life...

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
- Whoa.
- Like, my previous--yeah,

15:43.999 --> 15:44.999
and...
- Excuse me.

15:44.999 --> 15:46.999
- She kept on hitting
her head.

15:46.999 --> 15:48.999
[laughing]

15:48.999 --> 15:50.999
- And I've been single
for four years now.

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
- Yeah, that's what I mean.
Like, on top of you.

15:52.999 --> 15:55.999
- [giggling]

15:55.999 --> 15:58.999
I feel like I'm here with him
for, like, a reason.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.999
I don't know
what that reason is,

16:00.999 --> 16:03.999
so it's like,
"Why not give it a shot?"

16:03.999 --> 16:05.999
[both laughing]

16:05.999 --> 16:07.999
- I just walked downstairs, and
I was gonna go to my bathroom,

16:07.999 --> 16:08.999
and I heard Raquel's voice,

16:08.999 --> 16:10.999
but she wasn't in her room,
and I look over,

16:10.999 --> 16:12.999
and I see her in the top bunk
in the room next door.

16:12.999 --> 16:16.000
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:16.999 --> 16:18.999
That's Emile's bunk.
- I was not expecting that.

16:18.999 --> 16:21.000
- Are they snuggling?
- I'm not sure.

16:21.999 --> 16:23.999
She was kind of moving around.
- Wow.

16:23.999 --> 16:24.999
- I didn't want to, like,
be awkward and be like,

16:24.999 --> 16:26.000
"What's going on in here?"

16:29.999 --> 16:31.999
- Thanks for letting me
come in to talk to you.

16:31.999 --> 16:32.999
- It's my pleasure.

16:32.999 --> 16:34.999
- What? Fááá yeah.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.000
- Thank you.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.999
- Looks so cute.

16:41.999 --> 16:43.999
- By the hair
of our chinny-chin-chins...

16:43.999 --> 16:47.999
- Right?
- I forgot one thing for you.

16:47.999 --> 16:49.999
So you may strike them down.
- I can't wait.

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
- I have to have this.
- Uh-huh.

16:51.999 --> 16:53.999
Done and done.

16:53.999 --> 16:54.999
- He's Zeus, king of the gods.

16:54.999 --> 16:57.999
I knew he'd love it.
We have, like, the same brain.

16:57.999 --> 16:59.999
Enjoy your rest.
- I will see you at 8:00.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.999
- Perfect.
- Thanks, Kate.

17:01.999 --> 17:03.999
- It's exciting.
Is this love?

17:03.999 --> 17:05.999
- This is gonna be fun.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.999
- Let's bring
the whole jungle up.

17:10.999 --> 17:11.999
- Yeah.
- We're not going for subtle.

17:11.999 --> 17:14.999
The Greek party,
I just keep themeing up.

17:14.999 --> 17:16.999
So the swim platform
will be sea life

17:16.999 --> 17:18.999
with mermaids and shells,

17:18.999 --> 17:21.999
and the main deck will be
dinner, Mount Olympus, flowers,

17:21.999 --> 17:23.999
candles, earthly, beautiful.

17:23.999 --> 17:28.999
So I think Rocky's perfect
mermaid swim platform sea life.

17:28.999 --> 17:30.999
- This looks so good.
Mind blowing.

17:30.999 --> 17:32.999
- So the awards ceremony ends.

17:32.999 --> 17:34.999
You've got your tail on standby.

17:34.999 --> 17:37.000
You jump overboard, come around.

17:37.999 --> 17:39.999
- It looks beyond amazing
in here.

17:39.999 --> 17:40.999
Really.
- Oh, good.

17:40.999 --> 17:42.999
- Hi.

17:42.999 --> 17:43.999
- Hi, how are you?

17:43.999 --> 17:45.999
- Good.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.999
Um...

17:50.999 --> 17:52.999
- Hi, Zeus!
You nailed it.

17:52.999 --> 17:53.999
- Is this coming together?

17:53.999 --> 17:54.999
- I feel like
you really nailed it.

17:54.999 --> 17:56.999
- All right then!
- You can strike people down.

17:56.999 --> 17:59.999
- Well, I plan on doing that.
- Yeah, it's like [murmurs].

17:59.999 --> 18:01.999
- How are you looking?
- Real good.

18:01.999 --> 18:02.999
- Plato, huh?
- Yeah.

18:02.999 --> 18:03.999
- And Rocky's gonna
do the mermaid.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.999
If we had somebody
from deck crew

18:05.999 --> 18:08.999
also participating
in the theme night?

18:08.999 --> 18:09.999
- What are you looking for?
- Um, I'm thinking maybe

18:09.999 --> 18:13.999
Emile could wear kind
of a toga, a tasteful toga.

18:13.999 --> 18:15.999
- Yeah!
[laughing]

18:15.999 --> 18:18.999
You'd have to ask him.
I can't give him that order.

18:18.999 --> 18:20.999
- Emile. Emile, Kate.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.999
- He's very tired, and he's
been grumpy all day, so...

18:22.999 --> 18:24.999
-		 Go.
- Emile, do you mind

18:24.999 --> 18:28.999
playing a small, minor role
in the theme night tonight?

18:28.999 --> 18:31.999
- Ask her if
she'll give me a backrub.

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
- If you give him a backrub,
he'll do it.

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
- Copy.

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
- Okay.

18:37.999 --> 18:39.999
- [indistinct] is on his way.
- Copy.

18:39.999 --> 18:42.999
- Every Greek party needs
a Greek god to walk around,

18:42.999 --> 18:44.999
and I think Emile's perfect.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.999
He's got a great body,
chiseled features,

18:46.999 --> 18:49.999
and a brain made of stone.

18:49.999 --> 18:51.999
I would recommend
taking your shirt off

18:51.999 --> 18:54.999
and using this to cover the
parts you don't want exposed.

18:54.999 --> 18:56.999
Feel free to express yourself.

18:56.999 --> 18:59.999
And then you
can tie it with this,

18:59.999 --> 19:01.999
and then you get to wear this.

19:01.999 --> 19:04.999
Oh, that looks really
handsome on you.

19:04.999 --> 19:05.999
Oh, my gosh, you're so Greek.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.999
- I said I'll do it.
Taking one for the team.

19:08.999 --> 19:11.999
but I'm not happy about it.

19:12.999 --> 19:14.999
- All right,
let's go on downstairs.

19:20.999 --> 19:21.999
- I'm gonna give you
a nametag.

19:21.999 --> 19:24.999
It's Adonis.
It's actually a high compliment.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.999
I didn't get in this industry
to be somebody's boy toy.

19:29.999 --> 19:30.999
Fááá.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.999
- Sháá.

19:33.999 --> 19:34.999
- Damn it.
- Where were you guys

19:34.999 --> 19:36.999
when this was going on?

19:36.999 --> 19:38.999
- Somebody's gonna have to get
in the water and get it off.

19:38.999 --> 19:42.000
At this point,
things are gonna get ugly.

19:46.999 --> 19:48.999
It's actually a high compliment.

19:50.999 --> 19:52.999
I'm actually disappointed
Don is not here,

19:52.999 --> 19:54.999
'cause that is the stuff
he loved doing

19:54.999 --> 19:56.999
'cause
he loved the attention.

19:58.999 --> 20:01.999
- You look good.
- I--but I don't care.

20:01.999 --> 20:02.999
I don't feel comfortable.

20:02.999 --> 20:04.999
- You're turning me on
right now.

20:04.999 --> 20:05.999
Look at this.
Oh, yeah.

20:05.999 --> 20:07.999
- All right,
maybe the toga thing does work.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.999
Kate, where do you want me?
- Down there.

20:10.999 --> 20:12.999
Just go down there.
I'll tell you. Just go.

20:12.999 --> 20:14.999
- Look at this.
- Oh, look at this.

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
- I love it!

20:16.999 --> 20:18.999
- Derobe.
- Oh!

20:18.999 --> 20:22.999
- People of Eros,
our first diving championship,

20:22.999 --> 20:24.999
and I'm here to name the winner.

20:28.999 --> 20:29.999
Rocky.

20:29.999 --> 20:32.999
all: Whoo!

20:32.999 --> 20:33.999
- It was amazing.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.999
- Let's go party!

20:36.999 --> 20:38.999
- That's great, Rocky.
You're the best diver.

20:38.999 --> 20:41.999
Now if only you could just dive
right in to being a stewardess.

20:41.999 --> 20:44.999
- Now let us partake
in a little food and wine.

20:44.999 --> 20:46.999
- Yeah.
- If you don't mind

20:46.999 --> 20:48.999
having a drink right here while
we finish lighting the candles,

20:48.999 --> 20:50.999
I have a little bit
of Greek trivia.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.999
- Mm.

20:52.999 --> 20:54.999
- Not sure how much you
know about Greek mythology.

20:54.999 --> 20:57.000
Who the Hell was testicles?

20:57.999 --> 20:58.999
- Testacles.

20:58.999 --> 20:59.999
- Ha!

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
- Oh, I love it.

21:02.999 --> 21:05.999
Rocky's mermaid costume
is epic.

21:05.999 --> 21:06.999
I mean, who doesn't want
to be a mermaid?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.999
Let's be honest.

21:08.999 --> 21:09.999
Let's all be a mermaid.

21:09.999 --> 21:11.999
- Who was the wife
of Odysseus

21:11.999 --> 21:14.999
that waited for 20 years
for his return from Troy?

21:14.999 --> 21:15.999
- Good luck.

21:15.999 --> 21:16.999
I'm going to light the candles.
- Okay.

21:21.999 --> 21:24.999
- What is the name
of a half human,

21:24.999 --> 21:27.999
half fish sea nymph?

21:27.999 --> 21:28.999
- Hey, a mermaid!

21:28.999 --> 21:31.999
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah!

21:31.999 --> 21:33.999
- Fantastic.
Fantastic.

21:33.999 --> 21:36.999
- A Siren.
- Holy sháá.

21:36.999 --> 21:37.999
- Is that Rocky?

21:37.999 --> 21:39.999
- She's actually got a fin on.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.999
- That's awesome.
- Amazing.

21:42.999 --> 21:44.999
- Oh, my...

21:44.999 --> 21:47.999
- We move up to Mount Olympus
for dinner.

21:47.999 --> 21:50.000
- Rocky, I love you.
- It's Daryl Hannah.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.999
[laughter]

21:55.000 --> 21:56.999
- This is beautiful.

21:56.999 --> 21:58.999
- I like it.
- Thank you.

21:58.999 --> 22:00.999
- Rocky, do you want to go
blow-dry your hair a little bit?

22:00.999 --> 22:02.999
- Rocky, good job.
They loved it.

22:02.999 --> 22:04.999
- Pickled cucumber.
You got normal cucumber.

22:04.999 --> 22:06.999
- So which
should I take first?

22:06.999 --> 22:08.999
- No, they just sip it,
eat it and sip it.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.999
I'd have to say
European yachting

22:13.999 --> 22:15.999
is a little bit more
sophisticated.

22:15.999 --> 22:17.999
Straight plates,
ladies, yeah?

22:17.999 --> 22:19.999
- So this is
a deconstructed Greek salad.

22:19.999 --> 22:20.999
- Ooh!
- I've never seen

22:20.999 --> 22:22.999
anything like this.

22:22.999 --> 22:23.999
- It's amazing.
- It's a beautiful dish.

22:23.999 --> 22:25.999
- Leon, they are loving it.

22:25.999 --> 22:27.999
- Yeah.

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999
- I'm actually
quite proud of Leon

22:29.999 --> 22:31.999
for embracing the Greek theme.

22:31.999 --> 22:32.999
I'm wearing him down.

22:32.999 --> 22:34.999
These are rose garlic
beef cheeks.

22:34.999 --> 22:36.999
- Wow!

22:36.999 --> 22:37.999
- Wow.

22:37.999 --> 22:39.999
- This is very good.
- Cooked perfect.

22:39.999 --> 22:42.999
- I'm not much of a theme guy.
I let the food speak for itself.

22:42.999 --> 22:45.999
I went for beef cheeks,
and it's always a winner.

22:45.999 --> 22:46.999
- I'm about to start
clearing.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.999
They love it.

22:49.999 --> 22:54.999
I would love to have a fun
working relationship with Leon.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.999
Should I be sweet?
Should I be sassy?

22:57.999 --> 22:59.999
Should I be kiss-assy?

22:59.999 --> 23:01.999
I don't know.
I'll try any thing.

23:01.999 --> 23:04.999
He's such a psycho.

23:04.999 --> 23:07.999
So what we have here
is a Greek creme brulee.

23:07.999 --> 23:08.999
The bottom is
a strawberry confit.

23:08.999 --> 23:10.999
[indistinct chatter]

23:12.999 --> 23:13.999
- We must express our gratitude.

23:13.999 --> 23:16.999
- They seem very happy,
Leon, like, over the moon.

23:16.999 --> 23:18.999
- So should we go upstairs?
- Yeah.

23:18.999 --> 23:20.999
- Let's go.
- After you.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.999
- Bon appetit, guys.
- You outdid yourself.

23:22.999 --> 23:23.999
- Most beautiful food
I've had in a very long time.

23:23.999 --> 23:24.999
- No problem.
Thank you, guys.

23:24.999 --> 23:27.999
- The timing
of the meal was perfect.

23:27.999 --> 23:28.999
Loved it.
- Thank you.

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
Thank you for dining with us.
Cheers, guys. Thank you.

23:30.999 --> 23:31.999
- Thank you.
- I'll see yous later.

23:31.999 --> 23:33.999
Thank you. See you later.
- Cheers, guys.

23:33.999 --> 23:36.999
- Good night, Patrick.
- Oh.

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
- Oh, I'm gonna be
in the doghouse tomorrow.

23:45.999 --> 23:47.999
I forgot to call
my girlfriend.

23:47.999 --> 23:49.999
- Will she ignore you?

23:49.999 --> 23:50.999
Will she...
- No, she'll be like--

23:50.999 --> 23:51.999
She'll just get...
- Call you an assáááá?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.999
- Upset.

23:53.999 --> 23:54.999
[overlapping chatter]

23:54.999 --> 23:56.999
- Like sad or mad?
- Like sad.

23:56.999 --> 23:58.999
She'll get really sad.
- Aw.

23:58.999 --> 23:59.999
- Why do you have to
hurt her feelings?

23:59.999 --> 24:01.999
Why are you so mean?
- Come on then.

24:01.999 --> 24:04.999
- It sucks having a girlfriend
far away,

24:04.999 --> 24:06.999
and it sucks for her
having a boyfriend far away.

24:06.999 --> 24:08.999
Idle hands
make the Devil's work, right,

24:08.999 --> 24:10.999
so I keep my hands busy.

24:10.999 --> 24:12.999
- How long have you guys
been together?

24:12.999 --> 24:13.999
- Oh, God, like,
3 1/2 years now.

24:13.999 --> 24:16.999
- The ring...
- You gonna pop the question?

24:16.999 --> 24:18.999
- Come on.
- Not yet.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.999
- The ring?
- We're in no rush.

24:20.999 --> 24:21.999
No rush.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.999
- Thank you so much.

24:29.999 --> 24:30.999
- My pleasure.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.999
- Not for a few hours.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.999
- So how do you guys
feel

24:39.999 --> 24:40.999
considering
were down an indiv--

24:40.999 --> 24:42.999
What's your consensus on that?
- Great.

24:42.999 --> 24:44.999
- I don't think
it really makes a difference.

24:44.999 --> 24:45.999
- Yeah.
- Actually I think it actually

24:45.999 --> 24:47.999
made things go a little smoother
because, you know, with Don,

24:47.999 --> 24:49.999
I was, like,
relying on him to do things,

24:49.999 --> 24:51.999
but then he wouldn't do it.

24:51.999 --> 24:55.999
But now this guy and this girl
here work super hard.

24:56.999 --> 24:58.999
- I'm not worried about it.

24:58.999 --> 25:01.000
I'm gonna put Emile on the bow
and do the big sháá with her.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.999
- Works for me.

25:02.999 --> 25:04.999
- You ready
for some stew school 101?

25:04.999 --> 25:05.999
- Yeah, let's do it.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.999
- Kate's main beef with Rocky

25:07.999 --> 25:09.999
is that she doesn't know
how to do her job.

25:09.999 --> 25:11.999
- I just feel
like Rocky's here more for fun

25:11.999 --> 25:13.999
than her career.
- Yeah.

25:13.999 --> 25:15.999
- Maybe if you could help her?
- Yeah.

25:15.999 --> 25:19.999
So if I can teach Rocky
how to be a good stew,

25:19.999 --> 25:21.999
problem solved.

25:21.999 --> 25:23.999
First things for sure,
want to make sure

25:23.999 --> 25:25.999
these are shut at night.
- Okay.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.999
- And then we'll just
fold this back.

25:28.999 --> 25:30.000
We kind of do the harmonica
thing here,

25:30.999 --> 25:33.999
and then take the sheet
so it's the easiest possible way

25:33.999 --> 25:35.999
for a drunk charter guest
to fall into bed.

25:35.999 --> 25:37.999
You want to pay attention
to this corner,

25:37.999 --> 25:39.999
like, see, you don't
want to see folded back up,

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
and then this needs to be,
like, tucks in there.

25:41.999 --> 25:43.999
So you kind of just give it
a fluff and a chop.

25:43.999 --> 25:46.999
So then you want to hold this
and this, and just push this.

25:46.999 --> 25:47.999
And then you
just accordion this.

25:47.999 --> 25:49.999
For the charter guests
just to not see any water spots.

25:49.999 --> 25:50.999
See these water spots?

25:50.999 --> 25:52.999
You want to make sure
those aren't there.

25:52.999 --> 25:54.999
And then any water spots that...

25:54.999 --> 25:56.999
- Amy is great for taking
the time to teach me this.

25:56.999 --> 25:59.999
- And then any water spots
that may be on the mirror...

25:59.999 --> 26:01.999
- But it's like, "Yo,"...

26:01.999 --> 26:04.999
- And replacing any toiletry.

26:04.999 --> 26:05.999
- "It's so much work."

26:05.999 --> 26:08.999
- Oh, you got the fluff
and chop down.

26:08.999 --> 26:10.999
Sweet. That's awesome.
Good job.

26:10.999 --> 26:12.999
- Fááá this.

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
I'm, like, trying to be polite.
I'm holding it in.

26:14.999 --> 26:16.999
Namaste.
Namaste.

26:16.999 --> 26:18.999
Listen, I love it.

26:18.999 --> 26:20.999
I'm really getting this,
but I need a minute right now,

26:20.999 --> 26:23.999
'cause this is, like,

26:23.999 --> 26:25.999
I'm just breathing again.

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
- Like, do you just feel
like the deep way

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
I explained it--
- No, no, no.

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
I have to process this all,
you know?

26:31.999 --> 26:32.999
- Baby girl,
I'm trying to help you.

26:32.999 --> 26:34.999
'Cause if you don't step up
to the plate,

26:34.999 --> 26:36.999
we've got to get
someone in here that will.

26:36.999 --> 26:37.999
So I'm gonna go check
on laundry,

26:38.000 --> 26:39.999
and holler
if you need anything.

26:39.999 --> 26:40.999
- Got it.

26:42.999 --> 26:43.999
- Hey, you all right?
- It's just a barnacle cut

26:43.999 --> 26:45.999
from, like, ten days ago,

26:45.999 --> 26:47.999
and it's just deciding
to still ooze and be red.

26:47.999 --> 26:48.999
- Looks really gross.
All right,

26:48.999 --> 26:51.999
so get that forward bowline
that's on the dolphin.

26:51.999 --> 26:53.999
Get that on as soon
as you can, okay?

26:53.999 --> 26:55.999
Be quick with it.

26:55.999 --> 26:57.999
Like, I really don't want
to have another meeting

26:57.999 --> 26:59.999
like we had last time.

26:59.999 --> 27:01.999
- No.
We're looking out for you, man.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.999
- Okay, guys, tender's away.

27:06.999 --> 27:08.999
Let's get the anchor
up and get out of here.

27:08.999 --> 27:09.999
It's show time.

27:11.999 --> 27:13.999
- Hey, Cap,
we got a tight chain coming out

27:13.999 --> 27:16.999
at 12:00 sitting in front of us.

27:16.999 --> 27:17.999
All right, anchor's home.

27:17.999 --> 27:19.000
- Is someone
watching that towline?

27:20.999 --> 27:23.999
- Connie.
Connie, can you pull up?

27:23.999 --> 27:25.999
Sháá. Neutral.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Neutral. Neutral.
- At neutral.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.999
- The tender's loose.

27:31.999 --> 27:32.999
- Damn it.

27:32.999 --> 27:35.999
- Oh, no. This is not right.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.999
I should've been there.

27:37.999 --> 27:39.999
- Yeah, it's cut.

27:39.999 --> 27:41.999
- Where were you guys
when this was going on?

27:41.999 --> 27:43.999
- Lowering
those fenders over.

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
- Directly under the bow
to seal it.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
- I always put the tender
on the tow

27:47.999 --> 27:50.999
so that we can bring it with us
as we head back to dock,

27:50.999 --> 27:53.000
but this time
I didn't make sure

27:53.000 --> 27:55.999
that people were in the back
watching the tender.

27:55.999 --> 27:58.999
- Hey, Lee. Eddie.
- Go.

27:58.999 --> 27:59.999
- We're gonna have
to put the anchor back down,

27:59.999 --> 28:01.999
and we're gonna need
to get someone

28:01.999 --> 28:05.999
under to cut that line
off the prop.

28:05.999 --> 28:09.999
- Copy that.
We've sucked up the towline.

28:09.999 --> 28:10.999
How does that happen

28:10.999 --> 28:12.999
when I've got somebody
back there monitoring that?

28:12.999 --> 28:14.999
- Does anybody know where
the fáááing masks are kept?

28:14.999 --> 28:16.999
Fááá.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.999
- This is what I want. I want
you to put in extra fáááing work

28:21.999 --> 28:24.999
because you're the one
who fáááing cheated on me...

28:36.999 --> 28:38.999
and I think every one
of our crew is one of those.

28:38.999 --> 28:41.999
Captain Lee is obviously
Poseidon, god of the sea.

28:41.999 --> 28:45.999
Emile, he's like a minotaur,
half man, half bull.

28:45.999 --> 28:49.999
Amy is Dionysus, the goddess
of wine and good cheer.

28:49.999 --> 28:51.000
- Whoo!

28:51.999 --> 28:53.999
- Connie could really be
any Greek goddess

28:53.999 --> 28:55.999
because she's versatile.
- Give me my pants.

28:55.999 --> 28:57.999
- And then Rocky
is clearly a narcissist,

28:57.999 --> 28:59.999
'cause she only
cares about herself.

28:59.999 --> 29:04.999
Leon, Cyclops, a big monster
that only sees things one way.

29:04.999 --> 29:06.999
Eddie is clearly Atlas

29:06.999 --> 29:08.999
'cause he's got the world
on his shoulders.

29:08.999 --> 29:12.999
And I'm Athena, goddess
of wisdom and battle strategy.

29:18.999 --> 29:20.999
under to cut that line
off the prop.

29:20.999 --> 29:23.999
- Copy that.
We've sucked up the towline.

29:23.999 --> 29:25.999
- Does anybody know where
the fáááing masks are kept?

29:25.999 --> 29:27.999
- Somebody's gonna
have to get in the water,

29:27.999 --> 29:29.999
got to get under there
and get it off,

29:29.999 --> 29:31.999
get the anchor back up.

29:31.999 --> 29:33.000
Let's get it done.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.999
- When my crew screws up,

29:39.999 --> 29:44.999
it's my blame because I'm
the one in charge of them.

29:44.999 --> 29:47.999
I should've communicated
a little better, and I--

29:47.999 --> 29:49.999
I take responsibility for this.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.999
- Let's get out of here.
- Got it?

29:59.999 --> 30:01.999
- Oh, thank God, Amy.
- Ohh...

30:01.999 --> 30:05.999
- All right, guys,
we're docking in ten minutes.

30:05.999 --> 30:07.999
Interior crew,
I need radio silence from here

30:07.999 --> 30:09.999
until we get tied up, please.

30:09.999 --> 30:11.999
All right, let's do this.

30:11.999 --> 30:13.999
Let's get everything
we got as far as fenders

30:13.999 --> 30:15.999
go over the side now.
- Got it.

30:15.999 --> 30:18.999
- Moving to [indistinct] station
port side.

30:21.999 --> 30:23.999
[low transmission]

30:23.999 --> 30:25.999
- Okay.

30:25.999 --> 30:26.999
- All right,
let's lock it in.

30:26.999 --> 30:27.999
Lock the spring lines in,
please.

30:27.999 --> 30:28.999
- Roger that.

30:28.999 --> 30:31.000
- Let's get that forward line.
- I'm pulling it in.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.999
- Your spring lines
are locked in, Connie?

30:32.999 --> 30:33.999
- I am locked in.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
- Nice job, everybody.

30:35.999 --> 30:37.999
Down one person,
and you guys pulled it off.

30:37.999 --> 30:40.999
I need everybody
on the aft deck ASAP.

30:41.999 --> 30:43.999
Hey, sports fans.

30:43.999 --> 30:45.999
Show time.
- Are we ready?

30:47.999 --> 30:49.999
- Hate to say good-byes.

30:49.999 --> 30:51.999
- Take care.
- Have a safe journey.

30:51.999 --> 30:52.999
- Thank you, friends.

30:52.999 --> 30:55.999
[overlapping good-byes]

30:55.999 --> 30:57.999
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you.

30:57.999 --> 31:00.999
- It was an amazing trip.
- Thank you.

31:00.999 --> 31:01.999
- Captain,
I speak for all of us.

31:01.999 --> 31:05.999
We had the most amazing time,
and it's because of all of you.

31:05.999 --> 31:08.999
Connie out lobster diving
with us.

31:08.999 --> 31:11.999
Rocky, your mermaid
just was a huge hit.

31:11.999 --> 31:14.999
Kate, the theme party
last night was so much fun,

31:14.999 --> 31:16.999
and Chef Leon, outstanding.

31:16.999 --> 31:19.999
Every meal was outstanding,
and we had the best time,

31:19.999 --> 31:21.999
and you guys
deserve all of that.

31:21.999 --> 31:23.999
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

31:23.999 --> 31:25.999
- Thank you.
- Bye.

31:25.999 --> 31:27.999
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

31:27.999 --> 31:29.000
- Okay, let's get at it.

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
Attention all crew, I need
everybody in the crew mess

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
on the double.

31:37.999 --> 31:40.999
- Emile.
Oh, Emile, let me get in here.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
Oh, Emile.

31:42.999 --> 31:43.999
I'm getting in here.

31:43.999 --> 31:46.999
Oh, yeah.
What's up, dude?

31:46.999 --> 31:49.999
- This boat does hold 21 people
comfortably.

31:49.999 --> 31:51.999
Do your really have to go
at it right here?

31:56.999 --> 31:58.999
- I think this was
a great charter

31:58.999 --> 32:01.999
in spite of some hiccups
that we did have.

32:01.999 --> 32:05.999
The deck crew needs to be back
there observing the towline,

32:05.999 --> 32:07.999
keeping it out of the props

32:07.999 --> 32:09.999
so we don't have another
incident like we just had.

32:09.999 --> 32:12.999
Judging by the bulge
in my back pocket,

32:12.999 --> 32:14.999
it's pretty good.

32:14.999 --> 32:17.999
20 large divided by 10.

32:17.999 --> 32:18.999
It is in Bahamian money,

32:18.999 --> 32:20.999
but the bank
will make the swap out.

32:20.999 --> 32:21.999
It's a one-to-one.
Eddie. Amy.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.999
Freaking nice job.

32:23.999 --> 32:24.999
- Thank you, Captain.
- Very nice.

32:24.999 --> 32:26.999
- Bye, Don.
Sorry, check you later.

32:26.999 --> 32:28.999
We'll take your tip.

32:28.999 --> 32:29.999
- Rocky,...
- Thank you, Captain.

32:29.999 --> 32:31.999
- Your mermaid was a hit.

32:31.999 --> 32:32.999
Outstanding.

32:32.999 --> 32:34.999
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

32:34.999 --> 32:36.999
- Dean's trip was one
of the best charters

32:36.999 --> 32:38.999
I've ever worked
even though Don quit,

32:38.999 --> 32:41.999
but honestly, Amy and I
should be getting Rocky's tip.

32:41.999 --> 32:44.999
- You guys
will be staying in tonight.

32:44.999 --> 32:46.999
Trying to get a deckhand
in here,

32:46.999 --> 32:47.999
so I want the boat flipped.

32:47.999 --> 32:50.999
Nicely done.
- Yay!

32:56.000 --> 32:57.999
- What are you doing with that?

32:58.999 --> 33:00.999
- You've got to--

33:05.999 --> 33:06.999
And the bottom as well,

33:06.999 --> 33:09.999
the whole pole,
like you jerk a guy off.

33:09.999 --> 33:11.999
- Go talk
to whoever you need to talk to.

33:13.999 --> 33:15.999
- Emile.
- Yes, Captain?

33:15.999 --> 33:18.999
- How are you?
- Good. Yourself? Good.

33:18.999 --> 33:20.999
Just keeping the boat clean.
- Yeah?

33:20.999 --> 33:24.000
- Um, I know we're not allowed
off the boat tonight.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.999
- That would be true.

33:25.999 --> 33:28.999
- Can I have dinner off the boat
with Rocky tonight?

33:28.999 --> 33:30.999
Asking the captain
for his permission

33:30.999 --> 33:32.999
is like going back
to the principal's office.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.999
It's only dinner.

33:34.999 --> 33:36.999
- So I've got to let
both of you go?

33:36.999 --> 33:39.999
- Uh, yeah.
Can--can you?

33:41.999 --> 33:44.999
- Dinner, huh?
- For dinner, yeah.

33:44.999 --> 33:45.999
- Well...

33:48.999 --> 33:49.999
- Can we?

33:49.999 --> 33:51.999
- I suppose.

33:51.999 --> 33:52.999
Two hours.
- Two hours?

33:52.999 --> 33:54.999
- That's not 2 1/2 hours.

33:54.999 --> 33:56.999
- Okay. Thank you.

33:56.999 --> 33:57.999
- You're welcome.
Enjoy yourself.

33:57.999 --> 33:59.999
Have some fun.
- Thanks.

33:59.999 --> 34:00.999
- All right, buddy.

34:00.999 --> 34:03.999
I'd like somebody
to take me to dinner.

34:05.999 --> 34:06.999
- Yo.

34:06.999 --> 34:08.999
- Yeah.
- What up?

34:08.999 --> 34:09.999
- What up?
How you doing?

34:09.999 --> 34:11.999
You're smiling.

34:11.999 --> 34:13.999
What's going on?

34:13.999 --> 34:16.999
- I asked Captain Lee if we
could go out for dinner tonight.

34:16.999 --> 34:17.999
- You and I?
- Yeah.

34:17.999 --> 34:19.999
- Off the boat?
- 8:30.

34:19.999 --> 34:21.000
- I love it.
- Have something

34:21.999 --> 34:23.999
to eat away from everybody.
- I'm so down.

34:23.999 --> 34:24.999
I would love to go
on a date,

34:24.999 --> 34:27.999
and you, like, are telepathic.
- Synchronized.

34:27.999 --> 34:29.999
- Aw.

34:29.999 --> 34:30.999
That's so cute.

34:30.999 --> 34:33.999
It's so cute you asked me out.
Of course I'll go out with you.

34:33.999 --> 34:35.999
Yeah, you ask me out,
I'll go out with you.

34:37.999 --> 34:39.999
Emile just asked me out
on a date.

34:39.999 --> 34:42.999
- Whoa!
- Whoo.

34:42.999 --> 34:44.999
- How did he ask this?
- Yeah, let's hear it.

34:44.999 --> 34:46.999
- He was really cute.
He read my mind.

34:46.999 --> 34:47.999
It was, like, telepathic.
- Oh, my gosh.

34:47.999 --> 34:48.999
- He knew
what he came there for...

34:48.999 --> 34:50.999
- Really?
- And he delivered.

34:50.999 --> 34:52.999
It was like,...
[overlapping chatter]

34:52.999 --> 34:54.999
- What are you gonna wear?
- I don't know!

34:54.999 --> 34:57.999
Like, it was like this. Bam.

34:57.999 --> 34:58.999
- Nothing like being a man.

34:58.999 --> 35:00.999
And I just told you,
we're going on a date.

35:00.999 --> 35:02.999
That sound good?
- That's what I need.

35:02.999 --> 35:04.999
I don't need
any of this wishy-washy.

35:04.999 --> 35:05.999
- See, but there's potential.
- That's got some balls

35:05.999 --> 35:07.999
if you're asking Captain
to take some girl out.

35:07.999 --> 35:08.999
- Yeah, that's cute.
- Yep.

35:08.999 --> 35:09.999
- Boom.
- That's awesome.

35:09.999 --> 35:11.999
- Winning. Everyone.
- Cool.

35:11.999 --> 35:12.999
I got to get back to work.

35:12.999 --> 35:13.999
- See you.

35:13.999 --> 35:14.999
- She's cute.

35:21.999 --> 35:24.999
- I normally don't go
on dates in general.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.999
Dates are for old people,

35:26.999 --> 35:30.999
but Rocky is the type of girl
that likes to go on dates,

35:30.999 --> 35:32.999
and it would be good
to get to know Rocky.

35:32.999 --> 35:34.999
I could get some cologne there,
buddy.

35:34.999 --> 35:36.999
- Hey, baby girl.
- Hey.

35:36.999 --> 35:39.999
I'm gonna get dressed now.
And my question is, what am I

35:39.999 --> 35:41.999
saying with what outfit?
You know what I mean?

35:41.999 --> 35:44.999
- I'm always rooting
for a boat romance.

35:44.999 --> 35:45.999
A little excitement
and some romance

35:45.999 --> 35:47.999
that I can vicariously
live through

35:47.999 --> 35:50.999
because obviously nothing's
happening in this direction.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.999
- Really?

35:56.999 --> 35:57.999
- There you go.

36:00.999 --> 36:01.999
- Groomed by a professional.

36:01.999 --> 36:03.999
- On your hands
and your neck, just dry it.

36:03.999 --> 36:05.999
It can go on your arms
as well.

36:05.999 --> 36:06.999
You should probably do that.
- Yeah.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.999
- I've never gone on a date
with a younger guy ever.

36:10.999 --> 36:13.999
I think he knows that I'm a lot,

36:13.999 --> 36:14.999
and that's the truth.
I am a lot.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.999
- Aw, so pretty.

36:18.999 --> 36:20.999
- Fááá [mutters].

36:20.999 --> 36:21.999
- Wait, are you getting
really nervous right now?

36:21.999 --> 36:23.999
- Fáááing warm in here.

36:26.999 --> 36:28.999
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

36:28.999 --> 36:30.999
Are you ready? There you go.
- Aw.

36:30.999 --> 36:31.999
- I got you a flower.

36:31.999 --> 36:34.999
- That is really cute.
- Okay.

36:35.999 --> 36:36.999
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

36:36.999 --> 36:39.999
- You all have fun.
Enjoy your time off the boat.

36:41.999 --> 36:44.999
- I'm pretty sure
I see the first sparks

36:44.999 --> 36:46.999
of two soulmates colliding.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.999
It might be the exhaust
from the tender,

36:48.999 --> 36:50.999
but it might be soulmates.

36:51.999 --> 36:53.999
[giggling]

36:55.000 --> 36:56.999
[continues laughing]

37:05.999 --> 37:09.999
- My girlfriend and I
have had a lot of difficulties.

37:09.999 --> 37:10.999
Me traveling and going away,

37:10.999 --> 37:14.999
and I think that has been really
difficult on our relationship,

37:14.999 --> 37:17.999
and so it's a fáááed up
relationship.

37:20.999 --> 37:22.999
- I'm feeling wine.
Do you like wine, or do you

37:22.999 --> 37:25.999
like hard alcohol better?
- Whiskey.

37:25.999 --> 37:27.999
- Whiskey.
You can't pass out on me though.

37:27.999 --> 37:30.999
I need you all night long.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.000
- Definitely water. Thank you.
- How are you guys doing?

37:33.999 --> 37:35.000
- Great, and you, man?
- Doing great, thank you.

37:35.999 --> 37:36.999
- Can I get you something
to drink other than the water?

37:36.999 --> 37:39.999
- Um, yeah, do you think
we can start with a bottle

37:39.999 --> 37:40.999
of the Red Diamond?
- Sure.

37:40.999 --> 37:42.999
- And then would you
like a whiskey?

37:42.999 --> 37:43.999
- Yeah. Why not?

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
What would you like to eat?

37:45.999 --> 37:47.999
- He's nervous.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.999
I'd be nervous too
if I was Emile

37:49.999 --> 37:52.999
and I asked Raquel
out on a date.

37:52.999 --> 37:54.999
She's like a little
viscous dolphin tiger.

37:54.999 --> 37:55.999
[bleating]

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
All over you in the--
[hisses]

37:57.999 --> 37:58.999
- Aren't you scared?
- The whole thing's

37:58.999 --> 38:00.999
gonna hit you.
- You should have

38:00.999 --> 38:02.999
a seatbelt on me.
It's gonna be like, "Bam."

38:02.999 --> 38:03.999
Thank you.

38:06.999 --> 38:08.999
- Are you ready to order?

38:08.999 --> 38:12.999
- We will have the tuna crostini
and the New York strip.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
- Thank you.
- I'm just gonna eat the meat.

38:14.999 --> 38:15.999
That's all.

38:30.999 --> 38:32.000
- It's really tough dealing

38:32.999 --> 38:34.999
with the stresses
of a relationship

38:34.999 --> 38:37.999
while I'm out here working,
'cause you have no time

38:37.999 --> 38:40.999
to go have a well
thought out conversation.

38:49.999 --> 38:50.999
- I feel bad for Eddie
because he's been having

38:51.000 --> 38:52.999
a hard time
with his girlfriend.

38:52.999 --> 38:54.999
They really,
really care for each other,

38:54.999 --> 38:56.999
and I know this has to be hard
for them.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.999
- Can you unzip me?

39:15.999 --> 39:16.999
Ha ha ha!

39:25.999 --> 39:27.999
I'm out with a hot
younger man.

39:27.999 --> 39:29.999
Let's have fun.

39:29.999 --> 39:31.999
- Oh, yeah. Jagermeister.

39:31.999 --> 39:32.999
- Do you have a lemon drop?

39:37.999 --> 39:39.999
Oh, yeah.

39:39.999 --> 39:41.999
He's doing well.
He's working the date.

39:41.999 --> 39:43.999
He's like--he's charming.
He looks great.

39:43.999 --> 39:44.999
I love it.

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
- I'll have a Jagermeister
please.

39:46.999 --> 39:49.999
- Yeah. Let's step it up.

39:52.999 --> 39:55.999
♪ Can he pull it off? ♪

39:56.999 --> 39:58.999
Oh, was that you?
That was the point.

39:58.999 --> 40:01.999
That was it.
- Wait, wait.

40:01.999 --> 40:04.999
- And another one
and another and another.

40:08.999 --> 40:09.999
What?

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
Has Emile ever been on a date
before?

40:16.999 --> 40:19.999
That's three plus this...

40:19.999 --> 40:20.999
- Yeah.

40:20.999 --> 40:22.999
- I'm gonna feel good.

40:22.999 --> 40:23.999
Do you want to go
swimming?

40:23.999 --> 40:25.999
- Swim.

40:30.999 --> 40:32.999
- Who was the last girl
you dated?

40:32.999 --> 40:33.999
- I don't date. I mate.

40:33.999 --> 40:34.999
- Oh.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.999
- Wine and dine, 69.

40:38.999 --> 40:40.999
- Almost.
Almost had that one.

40:40.999 --> 40:42.999
I used to date this guy,
and he got whiskey dick.

40:42.999 --> 40:44.999
He had whiskey lip.
You good?

40:46.999 --> 40:48.999
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:48.999 --> 40:49.999
- What?

40:49.999 --> 40:52.999
- Are you getting too wasted?

40:52.999 --> 40:55.999
Okay, I've lost him.
I've lost him.

40:55.999 --> 41:00.999
Right now the only bunk
I'm getting into is my own.

41:00.999 --> 41:02.999
You're ready
to go to bed.

41:02.999 --> 41:05.999
- No, I'm not.
Are we going back to the boat?

41:05.999 --> 41:06.999
- Yes.

41:09.999 --> 41:11.999
Let's go.
Stand up.

41:13.999 --> 41:18.999
- I will let you take a seat,
and then I'll pick you up.

41:18.999 --> 41:20.999
- Mm.
- Oh.

41:20.999 --> 41:22.999
- Get me out of here.

41:22.999 --> 41:24.999
Try again.

41:25.999 --> 41:27.999
- Hey, Ed. How you feeling?

41:27.999 --> 41:29.999
- So you want a drink?
- Nah, I'm okay.

41:29.999 --> 41:31.999
I was--I was deep in it.
- Uh-oh.

41:31.999 --> 41:32.999
- Better now?

41:32.999 --> 41:34.999
- No, but that's all right.

41:34.999 --> 41:36.999
- Long-distance relationships

41:36.999 --> 41:39.999
while you're a yachtie
is extremely difficult.

41:39.999 --> 41:41.999
In the case of Eddie
and his girlfriend,

41:41.999 --> 41:44.999
it doesn't seem like absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

41:45.999 --> 41:47.999
- Can you unzip me?

41:47.999 --> 41:48.999
Unzip. Unzip.

41:48.999 --> 41:49.999
Guess what?

41:49.999 --> 41:51.999
Ha ha ha!

41:54.999 --> 41:56.999
That date was so painful.

41:56.999 --> 41:59.999
It was like nails
on a chalkboard, like,

41:59.999 --> 42:01.999
I miss my tail.

42:01.999 --> 42:04.999
Uh-oh, he's taking it off.
Don't. Don't you dare.

42:04.999 --> 42:06.999
Don't you dare.

42:09.999 --> 42:11.999
I'm gonna
have some alone time right here.

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
Emile: I'll give you
as much alone time.

42:13.999 --> 42:15.999
- Perfect.

42:15.999 --> 42:16.999
- Let me just give you
a kiss good-bye.

42:16.999 --> 42:18.999
- No, no, no.
I don't want to be touched.

42:18.999 --> 42:19.999
I'm good.
- You going inside?

42:19.999 --> 42:20.999
- Mm-mm.

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
Figure it out already.

42:30.999 --> 42:32.999
- Next time on Below Deck...

42:32.999 --> 42:33.999
- I think I'm gonna
go to California.

42:33.999 --> 42:36.999
- What's in California?
- Rocky's family.

42:36.999 --> 42:37.999
- Welcome aboard	 Eros.

42:37.999 --> 42:39.999
A little breezy,
but we'll get through it.

42:39.999 --> 42:41.999
- When you know
there's gonna be bad weather,

42:41.999 --> 42:43.999
you have to plan activities
for the guests.

42:43.999 --> 42:46.999
Left hand on brown starfish.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.999
- I'm not--I'm not
playing.

42:48.999 --> 42:51.999
- I'm running out of ideas to
keep these guests entertained.

42:51.999 --> 42:54.000
- Hey, we got a new deckhand
coming in about an hour.

42:54.999 --> 42:55.999
Emile.
- Dane.

42:55.999 --> 42:57.999
- Good to meet you.
- He's a very cute boy.

42:57.999 --> 42:59.999
- Okay, so what's up?
You have a girlfriend or what?

42:59.999 --> 43:01.999
- What the fááá is going on?

43:01.999 --> 43:03.999
- Hey, look.
Oh, look how cute.

43:03.999 --> 43:04.999
You all both got two
bracelets.

43:04.999 --> 43:05.999
Aw.
- My bracelet?

43:05.999 --> 43:08.999
Dude, they're from my sister, so
don't say any thing about that.

43:08.999 --> 43:11.999
- I'm not talking sháá.
I'm just saying...
