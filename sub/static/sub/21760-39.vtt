01:31.750 --> 01:34.580
Ha!

01:34.580 --> 01:36.790
Way to go, Spot.

01:36.790 --> 01:38.330
That was sensational.

01:39.960 --> 01:43.000
You know, nobody likes
a show-off chicken.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.330
Well, Amber does,

01:44.330 --> 01:46.290
and she's the greatest.

01:46.290 --> 01:49.960
Yeah, I wish Anita

Rolly, are you okay, boy?

02:07.290 --> 02:09.710
Aww, poor baby.

02:10.710 --> 02:12.920
You know Rolly.

Cruella:
Anita! Ruffles!
It's me!

02:56.040 --> 02:57.210
We sort of figured that

02:57.210 --> 02:58.420
when the mailbox
flew into the washer.

02:58.420 --> 03:00.670
Well, no use crying

My niece, Ivy.

03:14.460 --> 03:17.380
I kept thinking
of poor dear Amber

03:17.380 --> 03:19.750
dejected, alone,

03:19.750 --> 03:21.790
without companions!

03:21.790 --> 03:23.500
So I brought Ivy for visit

03:23.500 --> 03:25.830
while I have my toes waxed.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.670
These are for you, Amber,

03:28.670 --> 03:32.500
my sweetest and dearest
new friend.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.040
-It's a bomb!

03:38.040 --> 03:39.540
Uh, maybe not.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.000
You darling little puppy,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.580
give my dolly a kiss.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.210
You're so lucky to have
such cute little friends.

03:56.210 --> 03:59.750
I know,
and wait till you hear
my really great news.

03:59.750 --> 04:01.330
Aunt Anita
gave me permission

04:01.330 --> 04:04.170
to enter the Junior
Miss Grutely pageant.

04:04.170 --> 04:05.290
Pageant?

04:05.290 --> 04:08.170
My, isn't that
a happy coincidence?

04:08.170 --> 04:10.080
I'm in it too.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.960
Aren't I, Auntie Cruella?

04:11.960 --> 04:14.170
Don't be ridiculous.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.380
Beauty contests
are all shams.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.540
They've never once
picked me.

04:18.540 --> 04:21.830
So I'm afraid the answer
is absolutely not.

04:21.830 --> 04:23.960
Gee, then I'm afraid
I'll have to report

04:23.960 --> 04:26.290
all your naughty
secret bank accounts

04:26.290 --> 04:28.500
to the mean old
tax collectors.

I just know
I'll be the winner,
Auntie Cruella.

04:41.460 --> 04:43.330
-Hm-hmm.

04:51.670 --> 04:54.790
Welcome to the Junior
Miss Grutely Pageant.

04:54.790 --> 04:57.120
As your mayor,
it is my privilege

04:57.120 --> 04:59.620
to introduce
our first two prominent

04:59.620 --> 05:01.580
and distinguished judges:

05:01.580 --> 05:04.420
-Horace and Jasper.

05:06.040 --> 05:10.380
Ugh, okay, that's two
crooked votes for Ivy,

05:10.380 --> 05:12.120
courtesy of Cruella,

05:12.120 --> 05:14.620
but maybe
the third judge
will be more fair.

05:14.620 --> 05:18.580
And in the interest
of total impartiality,

05:18.580 --> 05:21.120
I have resigned
as the third judge,

05:21.120 --> 05:24.710
and my replacement will
be that beloved civic leader

05:24.710 --> 05:26.920
Ms. Cruella De Vil.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.040
-Great.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.500
And we thought
it was gonna be rigged.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.620
I wonder how much
that cost her.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.290
Five thousand.

05:39.290 --> 05:41.830
And you also pay
for the scholarship

05:41.830 --> 05:43.790
your niece is going to win?

05:43.790 --> 05:45.080
Correct.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.080
Well, I hope you're satisfied.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.120
It's costing me $10,000,

05:49.120 --> 05:52.620
but now you have
a 100% guarantee of winning.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.000
Sorry, Auntie,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.830
but I want at least 200%.

05:56.830 --> 05:58.750
Now excuse me, please,

05:58.750 --> 06:01.540
while I go crush
my only real competition.

06:12.960 --> 06:16.670
Now that your
totally impartial judges
have been selected,

06:16.670 --> 06:18.580
our first contestant
is Anita Dearly's

06:18.580 --> 06:22.040
charming loser--
uh, niece Amber.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.460
Amber?

06:28.040 --> 06:31.580
My very best friend Amber
is terribly shy.

06:31.580 --> 06:34.080
Too bad.
If she doesn't show up soon,

06:34.080 --> 06:35.830
she'll be disqualified.

06:38.670 --> 06:42.000
Hurry, Lucky.
Picking a lock
can't be that hard.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.420
It can't?
Then stick
your beak in it!

06:49.750 --> 06:52.250
Well, it appears
that Amber

06:52.250 --> 06:54.120
-has decided to drop--
-Amber: I'm here.

06:55.170 --> 06:57.080
-Bravo, bravo!

06:59.000 --> 07:00.830
Isn't that peachy keen?

07:00.830 --> 07:03.000
I couldn't be happier.

07:17.290 --> 07:21.830
Mayor:
And our next event
will be the fashion parade.

07:22.830 --> 07:24.880
Oh no,

07:24.880 --> 07:26.960
my fashion parade dress!

07:26.960 --> 07:28.790
What am I gonna do?

07:32.540 --> 07:34.330
Huh?

07:34.330 --> 07:37.460
You got to help her!
Quick! Grab some scissors.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.380
Great!
Amber's in a crisis here,

07:39.380 --> 07:41.080
and you're cutting coupons.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.960
No, no, no.
I saw this in an
old movie once.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.670
This poor downtrodden girl
in a dysfunctional family

07:47.670 --> 07:48.750
needed a dress

07:48.750 --> 07:50.880
so her mice
and bird friends
got together

07:50.880 --> 07:55.120
and made her a beautiful gown
from bits of nothing.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.380
Wow.

08:23.380 --> 08:26.290
That's the ugliest dress
I've ever seen.

08:26.290 --> 08:29.790
It worked a lot better
in the movie.

08:29.790 --> 08:32.420
Oh, well, it's either that
or my underwear.

08:32.420 --> 08:34.250
Thank you, guys.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.380
The audience
loves her outfit.

08:39.380 --> 08:40.790
Did you make it?

08:41.830 --> 08:44.620
-How dare these peons

08:44.620 --> 08:46.580
applaud that fashion fiasco!

08:46.580 --> 08:48.830
Memo to myself:
steal that design.

08:48.830 --> 08:50.580
Tell me again,

08:50.580 --> 08:52.880
is she the one
who bribed us?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.580
You dolt!

08:54.580 --> 08:55.830
I bribed you,

08:55.830 --> 08:57.670
and my niece
must be the winner.

08:57.670 --> 08:58.920
You're out of order, Horace.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.540
-Oh, owie!

09:00.540 --> 09:02.540
-Ow, ow!
-I like being a judge.

09:04.170 --> 09:06.170
Ahem, hello?

09:06.170 --> 09:09.580
They're applauding!
Do something.

09:09.580 --> 09:11.880
You'll win.
I guarantee it.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.880
Just wait until
the judging.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.790
I don't want to wait.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.710
Mayor:
Our next event,
the sports competition.

09:20.710 --> 09:23.080
I will be performing my sport,

09:23.080 --> 09:25.000
aerobic flower arranging.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.880
I will do gymnastics.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.830
Audience member: Wow.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.460
Heh, heh.

10:04.290 --> 10:06.380
Now that's
what I call talent.

10:06.380 --> 10:08.710
Let's go into
the agent business
and sign 'em up.

10:08.710 --> 10:10.670
Sit down, you buffoons!

10:10.670 --> 10:12.960
Crowd:
Give her a ten!
Give her a ten!

10:12.960 --> 10:15.210
Give her a ten!
Give her a ten!

10:15.210 --> 10:16.580
I'll give her
more than ten.

10:16.580 --> 10:18.210
I'll give her 100.

10:18.210 --> 10:20.710
Oh, yeah, I'll raise you ten.

10:20.710 --> 10:22.750
I'll give her a thousand.

10:25.170 --> 10:27.670
You dimwits!

10:27.670 --> 10:29.540
You just made Ivy lose.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.040
Oh, she'll ruin me.

10:33.580 --> 10:35.750
Mayor:
The judges have
reached a decision.

10:35.750 --> 10:39.330
Amber is our new
Junior Miss Grutely.

10:43.330 --> 10:45.620
B-b-b-but it
wasn't my fault!

10:45.620 --> 10:48.250
I'll call my lawyers.
They'll demand a recount.

10:48.250 --> 10:51.080
I can't discuss
your lame excuses now.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.330
I'm on the phone
to the IRS.

10:53.330 --> 10:54.750
No!

10:54.750 --> 10:56.960
Don't believe her.
She's an enemy agent!

11:01.750 --> 11:03.710
Good news, Auntie dear,

11:03.710 --> 11:06.710
the IRS can see you
in five minutes.

11:06.710 --> 11:08.380
Have a nice audit.

11:08.380 --> 11:10.420
-No, no!

11:17.210 --> 11:18.500
Ivy, guess what?

11:18.500 --> 11:21.580
We've all voted
you Miss Congeniality.

11:21.580 --> 11:22.580
Gimme!

11:22.580 --> 11:25.580
My only regret
is that my dear Auntie Cruella

11:25.580 --> 11:27.580
can't share this
touching moment.

11:27.580 --> 11:30.210
She was called away
on crucial government business.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.880
What do you want to do?
I don't know.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.620
What do you want to do?

11:51.620 --> 11:55.080
Swell, I'm so bored,
I'm talking to car parts.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.170
-Lucky: Pick it up, guys!

11:57.170 --> 11:59.330
-Okay, everybody, let's go!

11:59.330 --> 12:02.040
-Hurry, you guys.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.120
Cruella's gonna
blow up Hooper Dam.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.170
So she can flood the farm.

12:08.710 --> 12:10.540
And me without
my rubber booties.

12:10.540 --> 12:13.540
Wow, how exciting.
Can I--

12:13.540 --> 12:15.580
-Got to go!
-Let's go, come on!

12:15.580 --> 12:16.620
-Come on!
-Let's go!

12:16.620 --> 12:19.330
Ouch! Hey, wait for me!

12:27.120 --> 12:30.080
Any way you lie in it,
it's still mud.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.210
Hi, what's happening?

12:35.210 --> 12:36.710
Trouble in the herd again.

12:36.710 --> 12:39.500
Farmer Bill got a hold
of an electric clipper.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.460
And they're giving
the whole flock haircuts!

12:41.460 --> 12:45.330
Um, say,
I'm good with sheep.

12:45.330 --> 12:48.080
A pig herding livestock?
No way, babe.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.460
Bored, bored, bored.

12:55.460 --> 12:57.290
I'm bored!

12:57.290 --> 13:01.580
I am going barn crazy!

13:01.580 --> 13:03.790
-Come on, we don't
have much time.

13:03.790 --> 13:04.830
What now?

13:04.830 --> 13:07.210
We got an S.O.S.
on the barking chain.

13:07.210 --> 13:09.710
Lieutenant Pug is holed up
at the cat show!

13:09.710 --> 13:12.620
He's taken all
the Abyssinians hostage!

13:12.620 --> 13:14.620
That does it.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.080
I want in!

13:18.000 --> 13:20.620
Rolly:
Yeah, I hear Nanny
has her birthday presents

13:20.620 --> 13:23.380
-hidden in the chow tower.
-How cool!

13:23.380 --> 13:26.960
All in favor of a midnight raid
on the chow tower, say "Aye."

13:26.960 --> 13:28.380
Aye.

13:28.380 --> 13:29.830
-Aye.
-Dumpling: Aye!

13:33.960 --> 13:35.380
Ah! Ooh!

13:36.790 --> 13:39.460
Dumpling, we're
in the middle of--

13:39.460 --> 13:41.750
Deciding how to
scope out the presents.

13:41.750 --> 13:45.460
Duh.
And I will tell you
just how we'll do it.

13:45.460 --> 13:47.120
Did you just say "we"?

13:47.120 --> 13:51.250
Yes, you all and me,
the team.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.210
Hmm.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.080
Lucky: Uh, Dumpling,

13:57.080 --> 13:58.880
you can't just join.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.580
Besides we're
all filled up.

14:00.580 --> 14:02.500
I'm sure you understand.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.920
Right, now, I worked out

14:04.920 --> 14:07.170
our schedule of adventure
for today.

14:07.170 --> 14:09.540
After we break into
the chow tower,

14:09.540 --> 14:12.670
we'll go wing-walking
on Peterson's crop duster,

14:12.670 --> 14:15.080
then onto white water rafting

14:15.080 --> 14:16.380
in, um...

14:16.380 --> 14:17.420
Guys?

14:17.420 --> 14:18.750
Guys?

14:20.880 --> 14:23.120
Sheesh!
Can you believe her?

14:23.120 --> 14:24.710
Do this.
Do that.

14:24.710 --> 14:28.170
Yeah, thinking she can
just boss us around

14:28.170 --> 14:31.420
like-- like she was the queen of
the puppy people or something.

14:31.420 --> 14:36.420
Ohm, I am releasing
the stress of the day.

14:36.420 --> 14:38.580
-Dumpling: Hey!
-Ah!

14:38.580 --> 14:41.250
I didn't know
we were going swimming.

14:41.250 --> 14:42.540
Heads up!

14:42.540 --> 14:44.960
Ah! Dumpling, don't!

14:44.960 --> 14:47.460
Pushy pork
at 12 o'clock!

14:54.960 --> 14:57.500
Hmm, must be a leak somewhere.

15:03.420 --> 15:06.460
We got to get
that safe deposit key
away from Scorch.

15:06.460 --> 15:10.000
Yeah, if we don't,
Cruella can go to the bank

15:10.000 --> 15:12.250
and steal the deed
to the farm.

15:12.250 --> 15:14.210
Okay, let's sneak up
on him,

15:14.210 --> 15:16.830
but remember
be very, very--

15:16.830 --> 15:18.830
Ah, there you are!

15:18.830 --> 15:21.790
-Shh!
-Keep it down!

15:21.790 --> 15:23.460
-Cadpig: Quiet.
-Spot: Hush.

15:23.460 --> 15:26.380
What? I'm not talking loud!

15:26.380 --> 15:27.790
Am I talking loud?

15:27.790 --> 15:29.880
I don't think
I'm talking loud!

15:32.380 --> 15:35.790
He's getting away!
Nice going, Dumpling.

15:35.790 --> 15:38.420
-Smooth move, bacon.

15:38.420 --> 15:41.920
Hmph, like it was my fault.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.710
Spot: What a waste.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.500
Thanks to Princess
Roaring Mouth,

15:46.500 --> 15:49.290
it took us all day
to get the key away
from Scorch.

15:49.290 --> 15:52.380
Then we agree,
Dumpling's got to go.

15:52.380 --> 15:54.000
You said it--

15:54.000 --> 15:56.080
self-centered control freak.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.880
Right, that's your job.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.120
Hey!

15:59.120 --> 16:02.290
I don't know.
I mean, she is
a little bossy,

16:02.290 --> 16:04.080
but no one's perfect.

16:04.080 --> 16:07.210
I just kind of
feel sorry for her.

16:07.210 --> 16:08.880
You know, she just wants
to bee a part of something.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.670
That's it!
Rolly, you're a genius.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.210
I am?

16:13.210 --> 16:15.170
Okay, here's how it works.

16:15.170 --> 16:16.880
We tell her she can join,

16:16.880 --> 16:19.620
but only if she
passes certain tests.

16:19.620 --> 16:20.830
I get it.

16:20.830 --> 16:23.580
Then we make
the tests so hard

16:23.580 --> 16:25.250
she's got to fail, right?

16:25.250 --> 16:26.620
Then we can say,

16:26.620 --> 16:29.290
well, those are the rules.

16:30.830 --> 16:33.420
That is sneaky
and underhanded,

16:33.420 --> 16:34.960
and yet brilliant.

16:34.960 --> 16:38.880
But that's not
what I meant at all.

16:40.330 --> 16:41.540
Spots?

16:41.540 --> 16:44.960
Sure, if you really want
to fit in with us,

16:44.960 --> 16:46.920
you got to have spots.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.830
Spots?

16:48.830 --> 16:51.040
Yeah, even I got 'em.

16:51.040 --> 16:55.080
-Hmm.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.330
Dumpling:
Spots, spots, spots,
spots, spots, spots.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.210
Aha!

17:10.170 --> 17:13.210
Uh-oh, a pig in a blanket.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.170
Spots!
Count 'em and weep.

17:24.170 --> 17:28.080
Wow, that is one smart pig.

17:28.080 --> 17:31.460
Well, so much
for my exclusiveness

17:31.460 --> 17:34.170
as the only non-dog
member of this group.

17:34.170 --> 17:37.580
Uh, no!
We can't let her join!

17:37.580 --> 17:39.330
She'll drive us nuts.

17:39.330 --> 17:42.420
Face it, guys,
you can't scare her off.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.960
Don't be so sure.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.540
You know what I think?

17:48.540 --> 17:51.330
I think we should
give ourselves a name.

17:51.330 --> 17:54.420
Like Dumpling's
Dearly Farm Daredevils

17:54.420 --> 17:58.040
or Dumpling's
Dynamic Do-gooders.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.210
Kind of catchy, eh?

17:59.210 --> 18:02.500
Okay, here's your last test--

18:02.500 --> 18:05.080
the old foot bridge.

18:06.120 --> 18:09.710
You want me to cross
that little, bitty bridge?

18:09.710 --> 18:12.290
Well, if you want to quit...

18:12.290 --> 18:15.460
No, no, if that's what
you all had to do,

18:15.460 --> 18:17.290
I can do it too.

18:17.290 --> 18:20.120
Cadpig, you know
Dumpling's afraid

18:20.120 --> 18:22.290
of super-duper
high heights.

18:22.290 --> 18:24.250
Exact-imento.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.210
She'll never have
the nerve do it.

18:26.210 --> 18:27.580
And once she chickens out,

18:27.580 --> 18:30.120
she'll be out of
our fur forever.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.120
Oh, yeah?
Look!

18:38.170 --> 18:39.710
Ooh, ooh.

18:46.830 --> 18:48.790
Ow!

18:48.790 --> 18:52.250
I'm stuck.
I'm stuck!

18:52.250 --> 18:54.460
Gee, there's a surprise.

18:54.460 --> 18:56.420
Enough is enough!

18:56.420 --> 18:59.250
-I'm gonna go get her!
-Rolly, wait.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.250
Okay, calm down, Dumpling.

19:02.250 --> 19:03.960
I'll help you.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.460
No, I can do this myself.

19:05.460 --> 19:07.540
I can pass the test.

19:07.540 --> 19:10.250
Rolly:
Oh, there is no test!

19:10.250 --> 19:12.120
This was just a way
to scare you off,

19:12.120 --> 19:14.710
so you wouldn't
hang around us any more.

19:14.710 --> 19:16.000
Huh?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.290
Okay, now hold still.

19:20.670 --> 19:22.960
I could use some help, guys!

19:22.960 --> 19:25.420
-Coming.
-Uh, me too.

19:25.420 --> 19:27.040
Well?

19:27.040 --> 19:30.170
Okay, okay,
I'm coming too.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.790
-Focus, focus.

19:34.380 --> 19:36.420
-Cadpig!

19:40.210 --> 19:42.420
Help!

19:42.420 --> 19:44.500
She'll drown.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.210
We've got to
go in after her.

19:46.210 --> 19:48.210
Okay, hang on.

19:56.540 --> 19:58.250
We're coming, Cadpig.

19:58.250 --> 20:01.750
One side! Make way!
Coming in through!

20:04.790 --> 20:07.000
Wet, wet and cold.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.880
Wet and cold and--

20:08.880 --> 20:11.960
Pain,
now mostly pain.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.120
I got you, Cadpig.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.880
Cadpig who?

20:25.380 --> 20:27.540
Cadpig, are you okay?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.670
If you don't count
the hypothermia.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.960
Um, Dumpling, I--

20:37.960 --> 20:40.580
Well, listen, we owe you
an apology.

20:40.580 --> 20:43.000
Rolly:
We were all
real awful to you.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.500
You could have
turned your back on us

20:44.500 --> 20:47.120
like we tried
to do with you,
but you didn't.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.080
You still risked your life
to save Cadpig.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.880
Not everybody
would do that.

20:53.380 --> 20:55.790
Yeah, so we want
to make it up to you.

20:55.790 --> 20:58.120
We want you
to join our group.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.580
-Yeah.
-Same here.

21:02.290 --> 21:03.380
Please?

21:03.380 --> 21:06.670
Oh, well,
thank you, but no.

21:06.670 --> 21:08.040
No?

21:08.040 --> 21:11.000
See, after all
you put me through,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.250
I have learned
a lot about myself,

21:13.250 --> 21:16.040
about honesty
and self-respect.

21:16.040 --> 21:19.540
That is incredibly
evolved of you.

21:19.540 --> 21:22.420
Yeah, heh,
what's it mean?

21:22.420 --> 21:24.830
It means I have decided

21:24.830 --> 21:27.210
that I am going to start
a team of my own,

21:27.210 --> 21:29.170
and leave you guys
in the dust.

21:29.170 --> 21:34.210
Face it,
dogs just can't keep up
with a pig on a mission.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.620
See you around
the barn yard.

21:36.620 --> 21:39.920
That would be covering
the honest part.

21:41.790 --> 21:44.120
What do you want
to do now?

21:44.120 --> 21:48.080
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

21:48.080 --> 21:49.170
Dumpling:
Come on, everybody!

21:49.170 --> 21:53.040
Dr. Diablo is plotting
to blow up the salmon hatchery.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.710
We have got to stop him.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.830
Gee, I wish our lives
were that exciting.

22:05.830 --> 22:07.120
Huh-huh.
