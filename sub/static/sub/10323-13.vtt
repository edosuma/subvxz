Earl, it's time.
My water broke.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.302
I'll call a plumber
in the morning.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.338
Oh, my God!
Your water broke!

11:45.372 --> 11:48.708
Remember, short breaths.
[ Breathing Rapidly ]

11:53.146 --> 11:56.884
[ Breathing Rapidly ]

11:56.917 --> 11:59.953
Hurry, Earl.
I think we're getting closer!

11:59.987 --> 12:04.758
Don't worry.
We're in the hospital.
Everything's gonna be fine.

12:04.792 --> 12:07.027
Uh-oh.
[ Elevator Rumbling ]

12:07.060 --> 12:10.363
[ Earl Narrating ] Since Edwin,
the town dwarf, had died,
the only people around...

12:10.397 --> 12:13.834
who wore tiny little hats
and drove tiny little cars
were the Knights of Camden.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.369
So Darnell suggested they
stop by to ask some questions.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.506
Oh, my God.
Kill me when I'm 50.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.441
Wake up.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.478
Oh, hey, it's you.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.550
[ Earl Narrating ]
They'd come to the right place.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.020
It ends up that night,
Randy had staggered his way...

12:33.053 --> 12:35.022
into the Knights of Camden's
new member mixer.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.124
Oh, hey, buddy.
Come on in.

12:37.157 --> 12:40.027
We could use a young fellow
like you around here.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.395
We're dying off
like crickets.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.465
** [ Rock ]
[ Earl Narrating ] Randy was
drunk when he got there,

12:45.498 --> 12:49.036
but after an hour of limbo
and all-you-can-drink
gin rickeys,

12:49.069 --> 12:51.171
he was in full party mode.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.807
Then I showed up.
[ Man ]
* La, la, la, la, limbo

12:53.841 --> 12:55.843
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

12:55.876 --> 12:58.245
[ Screaming ]

13:01.148 --> 13:03.783
Randy!

13:16.463 --> 13:18.398
Randy!

13:22.069 --> 13:24.004
Randy!

13:25.372 --> 13:28.241
I got a picture
of that night right here.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.410
It's between the one
of dead Louie
and dead Frank.

13:32.445 --> 13:35.215
So he did try to kill me.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.051
I'm not even sad about it
anymore. I'm angry.

13:38.085 --> 13:41.054
I mean, I'm still kinda sad,
but more angry than sad.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.290
Is there a word for that?
'Cause there should be!

13:43.323 --> 13:47.360
I'm feeling pretty
"terrhurtsible."

13:47.394 --> 13:51.198
Really, really "terrhurtsible,"
with a touch of "sangry."

13:51.231 --> 13:54.534
Just calm down.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.137
Hey, wrinkles, is there
anything else you can tell us
about that night,

13:57.170 --> 13:59.506
like where they might
have come from?

13:59.539 --> 14:04.978
Well, the only other thing
I know is, the big guy here
had his foot covered in tar,

14:05.012 --> 14:08.916
and he tracked it
all over our dance floor.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.051
Joy, does this antenna
look familiar?

14:11.084 --> 14:13.987
Looks like panties
hanging on it.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.990
Holy crap.
That's the "pantenna."

14:17.024 --> 14:19.659
[ Earl Narrating ]
The "pantenna" used to be
a tradition in the trailer park.

14:19.692 --> 14:23.463
After girls hooked up
with a guy, they'd shoot
their panties at the antenna.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.266
Story was, if they stuck,
it was true love.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.601
If they fell,
it was likely the clap.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.039
[ Woman ]
Damn it!

14:35.508 --> 14:38.912
Bingo!
Look at that.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.214
[ Randy ]
More tar footprints.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.588
Great googly moogly!
There's the bike.

14:56.496 --> 15:00.000
Damn. People sure do
have a lot of sex
in this trailer park.

15:00.033 --> 15:03.103
Oh, watch your step.
Those are the clap panties.
Oh!

15:10.043 --> 15:14.614
Oh, no.
I remember what happened.
I remember it all.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.517
[ Earl Narrating ]
Suddenly the whole night
came rushing back to Randy.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.686
After Darnell kicked us
out of the Crab Shack,

15:19.719 --> 15:22.255
we knew the cops were looking
for the stolen bike,

15:22.289 --> 15:24.958
so we decided to hide it where
no one would think to look--

15:24.992 --> 15:27.227
on the roof of
Deaf Charlie's trailer.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.230
We took the chain off
an old chainsaw
and put it on the bike.

15:30.263 --> 15:34.334
It wasn't gonna last long,
but luckily we only had
to drive 15 feet.

15:34.367 --> 15:38.638
Wish me luck.
Be careful. I didn't
build a very wide ramp.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.375
[ Engine Starts ]

15:47.647 --> 15:50.150
Earl, you did it!
You made it up the ramp!

15:50.183 --> 15:52.685
I thought for sure
you were gonna--

16:01.094 --> 16:03.430
[ Grunting ]

16:03.463 --> 16:06.066
[ Earl Narrating ]
We covered the bike so nobody
would see it from below.

16:06.099 --> 16:09.169
Then I kicked down the ramp
and planned our escape.

16:12.772 --> 16:18.378
Okay, the cops are gonna
be looking for a guy
and a giant chicken.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.714
But they're never gonna be
looking for two giant
half-chickens.

16:21.748 --> 16:25.318
Give me your pants.
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah. Cops are dumb.

- Get down, get down!

16:38.465 --> 16:41.401
All right. They gotta be here
somewhere. There's yellow
feathers everywhere.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.603
Fan out.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.577
[ Hiccups ]
Shut up!

16:50.610 --> 16:53.380
I can't help it, Randy.

16:53.413 --> 16:57.684
When I'm nervous and drunk,
I get the hic--
[ Hiccups ]

16:57.717 --> 17:00.653
Scotty, I think there's
somebody behind the trailer.

17:03.623 --> 17:07.127
Rock smashes scissors.
Sucks to be you.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.698
[ Hiccups ]
Shh.

17:11.731 --> 17:15.268
[ Hiccups ]
Will you just shut up
already?

17:22.109 --> 17:24.244
[ Shouting Stops ]

17:32.152 --> 17:34.554
[ Earl Narrating ]
After about 10 minutes,
the cops ran out of steam.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.689
Unfortunately, so did I.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.759
All right, they're gone.
Let's get out of here.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.531
Earl!

17:44.564 --> 17:46.433
Earl?

17:46.466 --> 17:49.302
Oh, God! I killed him.
I killed him.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.105
I gotta think of what to do.
Think of what to do.

17:52.139 --> 17:55.775
I gotta make like
a banana and split.
[ Chuckles ]

17:55.808 --> 18:01.181
Aw! Damn it! I finally got
to use that one, and Earl
was too dead to hear it.

18:01.214 --> 18:04.551
It just keeps gettin' worse.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.553
[ Earl Narrating ]
Randy was scared
that now the cops...

18:06.586 --> 18:08.521
would be out looking
for a murdering half-chicken,

18:08.555 --> 18:11.090
so he ditched the suit
to go on the run.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.728
Good-bye, Brother.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.221
That son of a bitch killed me!

18:46.926 --> 18:49.562
That's when I broke off
the pantenna for a weapon...

18:49.596 --> 18:52.765
and followed Randy's
tar-covered footprints
to the Knights of Camden hall.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.368
No wonder he tried to kill me.
I deserved it.

18:55.402 --> 19:00.240
I killed him and went to a party
with little old men and played
"try to walk under the stick!"

19:00.273 --> 19:03.876
-Well, everyone
grieves differently.
-No! No! I'm a terrible brother.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.878
I should be the one
in the coma!

No.

19:15.322 --> 19:18.525
You wanna go return
the motorcycle so we can get it
crossed off Earl's list?

19:18.558 --> 19:21.561
Yeah.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.497
[ Earl Narrating ]
Those chopper guys were pretty
glad to get their bike back,

19:24.531 --> 19:26.899
but Randy
was still feeling rotten.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.373
That's how they stole it.

19:33.406 --> 19:36.809
Which one of you jackasses
left the keys in the bike?

19:41.614 --> 19:45.452
Well, Earl,
we found the motorcycle.

19:45.485 --> 19:49.689
I also found out I tried
to kill you first.

You're an uncle.
