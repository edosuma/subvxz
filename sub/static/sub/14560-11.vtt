00:09.443 --> 00:11.312
CHARLIE:
Entropy--

00:11.379 --> 00:13.714
a measure of randomness;

00:13.781 --> 00:16.050
a parameter of disorder;

00:16.117 --> 00:21.155
energy broken down
in irretrievable heat.

00:25.893 --> 00:29.029
(man singing in Hebrew)

00:40.208 --> 00:42.610
What might appear to be chaos,

00:42.676 --> 00:45.446
even decay, is really
a system's way

00:45.513 --> 00:48.449
of smoothing out differences;

00:48.516 --> 00:51.552
its search for equilibrium.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.723
Too florid?

00:55.789 --> 01:00.694
For 30 overachieving
grad students? Probably.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.130
But for me...

01:02.196 --> 01:04.598
Tell me more about
irretrievable heat.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.535
Where language
might fail us...

01:10.738 --> 01:13.841
...the poetries of math
and physics bring clarity.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.812
Observing spontaneous
changes...

01:23.083 --> 01:25.819
...in isolated systems.

01:28.656 --> 01:33.894
* I see the rifles
coming over the hill *

01:33.961 --> 01:39.667
* And if you shout,
maybe they stop and won't kill *

01:39.733 --> 01:48.108
* But if you think like me,
you'll be as dead as he... *

01:50.043 --> 01:52.613
(alarm blaring)

01:52.680 --> 01:57.818
* I see the lion
crawling over your bed *

01:57.885 --> 01:59.287
* And if you stay...

01:59.353 --> 02:00.988
Entropy is our yardstick

02:01.054 --> 02:03.123
measuring progress,

02:03.191 --> 02:05.293
defining the boundaries
of a story,

02:05.359 --> 02:08.596
a beginning and an end.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.740
Entropy has the unique ability

02:19.807 --> 02:23.211
to choose a particular
direction for time.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.879
The Arrow of Time.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.515
-The Arrow of Time.

02:27.581 --> 02:33.020
* I see more color
in your eyes *

02:33.086 --> 02:36.123
* Than the reflections...

02:36.190 --> 02:38.025
Uncorrelated parts interact

02:38.091 --> 02:43.664
and find their connections
in an evolving system.

02:43.731 --> 02:48.969
* I see the rifles
coming over the hill *

02:49.036 --> 02:54.742
* And if you shout, maybe
they'll stop and won't kill *

02:54.808 --> 03:01.048
* And if you think like me,
you'll be as dead as he *

03:01.114 --> 03:03.751
* Some day

03:07.521 --> 03:13.060
* I see the color
in your eyes... *

03:13.126 --> 03:16.063
So, from one perspective,

03:16.129 --> 03:18.466
entropy is a clock,

03:18.532 --> 03:20.368
charting the irreversible.

03:20.434 --> 03:24.272
* ...The world as your side.

03:39.487 --> 03:42.222
Looks like an arrow
pointing straight back to L.A.

03:42.290 --> 03:45.526
Nice of them to leave us
a trail of bread crumbs.

03:57.505 --> 03:58.639
OFFICER:
Hey, Sinclair.

03:58.706 --> 03:59.540
Hey, Joe.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.275
What do you need?
-Great big net.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.510
Got three men over the wall.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.312
Had a car waiting.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.613
Tire tracks say

04:05.679 --> 04:07.481
older model,
long wheel base.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.849
Well, that
narrows it down.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.784
Unless we hear reports
about three bad-asses

04:10.851 --> 04:12.553
terrorizing the countryside
in their underwear,

04:12.620 --> 04:14.522
count on a change
of clothes, too.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.557
So, they already made it
past the roadblocks, huh?

04:16.624 --> 04:17.791
JOE:
Long gone.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.660
Look at this here.

04:21.895 --> 04:22.930
Oh, looks like...

04:22.996 --> 04:24.465
Dental floss.

04:24.532 --> 04:25.633
LIZ:
How the hell did

04:25.699 --> 04:26.634
they get that much
dental floss?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.001
Well, that's a very
good question.

04:28.068 --> 04:28.936
They must've had a lot

04:29.002 --> 04:30.738
of time on their hands.
- "They" being...?

04:30.804 --> 04:33.441
Well, that is why I
dialed you in on this.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.775
WOMAN:
Hey, Ugly!

04:37.845 --> 04:40.881
Ugly?
-Uh, yeah, that's Ugly Joe.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.616
There's a Big Joe,

04:42.683 --> 04:45.052
Little Joe and an Ugly Joe.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.820
There's a bigger Joe?

04:46.887 --> 04:49.490
No, an uglier one.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.499
(sighs) Damn.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.634
NIKKI:
Buck Winters.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.370
Tell me about the other two.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.607
Gray McClaughlin.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.542
Doesn't look like
he's had any time to commit

05:08.609 --> 05:09.677
a crime where he didn't
get caught.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.379
Started off low-level
drug dealing.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.646
Couldn't make
that work.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.114
Yeah, I just
read something

05:14.181 --> 05:16.049
like 95% of small businesses

05:16.116 --> 05:17.250
fail their
first year.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.952
He's not a bad-looking cat.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.087
Really?

05:20.153 --> 05:22.590
Oh, but when you guys notice,
it's okay.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.124
DON:
All right, come on.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.258
Next.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.027
Uh, Rafe Lansky.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.762
He's an Aryan-looking
individual,

05:28.829 --> 05:31.231
but he's pretty ethnically
enlightened.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.533
He freelanced
for the Colombians,

05:32.600 --> 05:34.301
the Jamaicans,

05:34.368 --> 05:35.969
the Russians...
-DON: As?

05:36.036 --> 05:37.304
Hit man-- dropped at least

05:37.371 --> 05:38.606
six bodies we know of.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.442
OC moved four others into
the "pending inactive" column

05:41.509 --> 05:43.477
as "likely but
unprovable."

05:43.544 --> 05:45.345
DON: Anything with
known associates?

05:45.413 --> 05:47.481
I just got the files, boss.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.583
DON:
All right.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.619
It's a fugitive case
just like any other.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.523
You know, any other case,
the first thing I look at

05:55.589 --> 05:57.357
is the guy who shot his wife.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.827
Go to the second.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.563
Okay.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.765
DAVID: Buck Winters,
17 years old,

06:04.832 --> 06:06.667
hooks up with his
teacher, Crystal Hoyle.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.736
Buck's father already beats
the crap out of him

06:08.802 --> 06:10.504
on a regular basis--
he finds out,

06:10.571 --> 06:12.339
he beats some more
of the crap out of him.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.674
Buck killed him

06:13.741 --> 06:14.842
for trying to
keep them apart.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.744
Pit bull puppy love.
-Buck and Crystal

06:16.810 --> 06:19.413
rob and shoot their way
across the country,

06:19.480 --> 06:20.714
get married in Vegas.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.583
LIZ:
Because, really, who doesn't?

06:22.650 --> 06:24.652
These are two seriously
fearless individuals.

06:24.718 --> 06:28.689
They robbed a meth lab
and blew it up.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.825
We caught Buck, and Crystal
retaliated by kidnapping Megan.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.927
Megan Reeves.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.362
This is that case?

06:35.429 --> 06:37.898
Don never talked to you
about any of this?

06:38.999 --> 06:40.367
No.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.635
COLBY:
When Hoyle took Megan,

06:41.702 --> 06:43.403
Don lost it--
some things happened

06:43.471 --> 06:44.638
during his interrogation
with Buck.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.106
NIKKI:
Things like...?

06:46.173 --> 06:48.609
All I know is Don got
the information he needed,

06:48.676 --> 06:50.678
Buck went to the hospital,
and we got Megan back.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.846
Crystal Hoyle
went down shooting.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.615
Actually, she drove
at our roadblock

06:54.682 --> 06:56.183
with a carload of hand grenades.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.486
Don's the one
that pulled the trigger.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.555
NIKKI: Just another day

07:01.622 --> 07:02.756
in the exciting
field of crime fighting.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.726
Why is Don acting
like he did something wrong?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.761
Just, sometimes,
this job forces you

07:07.828 --> 07:09.497
to ask yourself
some really hard questions,

07:09.563 --> 07:11.398
and I guess that
was one time

07:11.465 --> 07:13.366
Don just wasn't ready
for the answers.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.368
The kid threaten Don?

07:15.435 --> 07:16.670
He didn't have to.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.640
I'll take Lansky.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.642
Why don't you take McClaughlin?

07:21.709 --> 07:23.811
Unless, of course,
you think you're

07:23.877 --> 07:26.480
gonna lose yourself
in his deep brown eyes.

07:30.884 --> 07:31.885
Oh.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.587
Hey.
-I thought you snuck out early

07:33.654 --> 07:35.022
to work on your lecture.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.858
You guys remember
that idea I had

07:37.925 --> 07:39.960
for finding a complex
polynomial encryption?

07:40.027 --> 07:41.595
Withers just
patented it.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.163
It wasn't Withers.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.532
It was his collective.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.066
In fact, I think
a civil engineer

07:46.133 --> 07:48.802
suggested attacking it
through Riemann's hypothesis.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.003
LARRY:
Yeah, I'm sorry.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.672
Color me stodgy,
but these attempts

07:51.739 --> 07:54.007
to manufacture insight
by committee

07:54.074 --> 07:56.476
run counter to the entire
history of great thought.

07:56.544 --> 07:57.878
AMITA: There are plenty
of instances

07:57.945 --> 08:00.213
of great thought coming
in the works of groups.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.449
Uh, Pisarro, Monet and Degas.

08:02.516 --> 08:05.285
Wedgewood, Watt
and Darwin.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.554
Oppenheimer, von Neumann,

08:06.620 --> 08:07.888
Wilson, Weisskopf.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.857
The neo-Confucians.
-Okay, fine.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.659
Go ahead, pelt me
with specifics.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.594
Hey, we should start
our own think tank.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.395
You know,
once a month.

08:15.462 --> 08:19.600
Anything anyone comes up with,
we all... everyone shares in.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.300
Well, I don't know why

08:20.367 --> 08:22.402
I didn't suggest that
in the first place.

08:22.469 --> 08:23.503
We could get Osaki

08:23.571 --> 08:24.905
for chemistry, Galuski for that

08:24.972 --> 08:26.406
down and dirty
engineering perspective.

08:26.473 --> 08:29.577
You know who would add
a fresh dimension of thought?

08:29.643 --> 08:31.178
Who?
-Your dad.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.179
LARRY:
Hey.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.313
Certainly.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.782
35 years of practical experience

08:34.848 --> 08:36.650
in urban planning,

08:36.717 --> 08:39.286
but that fresh eye
of the student.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.654
CHARLIE:
Yeah.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.122
I don't think so.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.195
So...

08:48.261 --> 08:50.063
who wants to talk dental floss?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.668
NIKKI: Gray McClaughlin
has a girlfriend.

08:54.735 --> 08:55.703
Deanne Drake.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.004
Yeah, visited
him 12 times

08:57.070 --> 08:58.806
in the last 18 months--
and marshals

08:58.872 --> 09:00.040
are staked out
at her house,

09:00.107 --> 09:01.675
tapped her phones--
no activity.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.711
I got a work address.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.378
Figured we could
go shake her up.

09:05.445 --> 09:06.614
Pier 16, huh?

09:06.680 --> 09:08.015
And she is?

09:09.382 --> 09:10.851
Forklift driver.
Huh.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.753
McClaughlin really attracts
the, uh, girlie,

09:12.820 --> 09:14.788
super-feminine types, huh?

09:16.323 --> 09:20.594
So, how did she, uh, meet
this "good-looking cat"?

09:20.661 --> 09:22.696
Prison pen pal Web site.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.732
Insert your next joke here.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.067
Oh, no. No way I squander
this opportunity.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.938
I figure I'll toss a few ideas
around with David,

09:31.004 --> 09:32.740
make sure we really
get this one right.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.341
You do know I'm never
gonna share again.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.944
(elevator bell dings)

09:37.010 --> 09:39.212
Hey, Nikki just found a known
associate of McClaughlin's,

09:39.279 --> 09:41.815
figured we'd...
-Yeah, that's good.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.219
DAVID:
It's 30 feet long.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.656
AMITA: Floss is sold
in containers of 20

09:48.722 --> 09:50.691
to 150 yards.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.125
I'm an informed shopper.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.593
CHARLIE:
Eyeballing the density

09:53.661 --> 09:54.928
of this rope, I'm thinking

09:54.995 --> 09:57.698
it's got to be 18,000,
maybe 19,000 feet.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.800
LARRY: Three and a half
miles of dental floss,

09:59.867 --> 10:03.270
even assuming an average
container size of 50 yards.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.038
127 rolls of floss.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.707
LIZ: You guys find
new and special ways

10:06.774 --> 10:07.841
to freak me out all the time.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.376
DAVID:
127 rolls of floss,

10:09.442 --> 10:10.978
which is a restricted item

10:11.044 --> 10:12.713
in prisons
for this exact reason.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.081
LIZ: Yeah, well,
this and the fact

10:14.147 --> 10:17.050
that it's a great way to slice
through someone's jugular vein.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.118
Ew...

10:18.185 --> 10:21.588
Well, I mean, we could apply
a simplex algorithm.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.423
The time it took
to build a ladder

10:23.490 --> 10:25.025
based on the difficulty

10:25.092 --> 10:25.826
of access.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.094
LARRY: They had
limited time

10:27.160 --> 10:28.729
to work on it,
when the other prisoners

10:28.796 --> 10:30.230
and the guards
weren't watching them.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.700
AMITA: And they'd have
to find a way to hide

10:32.766 --> 10:33.734
the containers,
throw them out.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.836
So, some floss math

10:35.903 --> 10:37.771
tells us when they get
started, so it might

10:37.838 --> 10:39.840
say something about...

10:39.907 --> 10:41.709
where they're going-- what?

10:42.609 --> 10:44.044
"Floss math."

10:44.111 --> 10:46.780
DAVID: Okay, so we're talking
about at least months

10:46.847 --> 10:49.282
of planning; Buck Winters--
he was all impulse.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.617
The other two...

10:50.684 --> 10:52.319
eh, they're
no masterminds, so...

10:52.385 --> 10:54.755
Buck Winters?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.257
Don didn't... ?

11:00.828 --> 11:02.696
You know, it all,
it all went down

11:02.763 --> 11:04.031
last night so I'm pretty sure

11:04.097 --> 11:06.299
he doesn't even
know you're up yet.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.301
So...

11:15.375 --> 11:16.309
I just saw the teletype.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.813
Yeah, the marshals
dialed us in.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.849
All right, let's just assume

11:21.915 --> 11:23.216
the requisite stoic
Don Eppes posture.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.818
You lock up enough
of these guys,

11:24.885 --> 11:26.119
sooner or later, they get out.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.221
Don, this kid
breaks out of jail,

11:28.288 --> 11:29.622
he makes a beeline
straight towards you

11:29.689 --> 11:31.558
and he doesn't even
bother to cover his tracks.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.894
He's just another fugitive.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.328
You know, we hunt him down

11:35.395 --> 11:37.931
and we put him back.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.903
I hope you're just lying to me,
and not to yourself.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.173
Come on.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.782
COLBY:
Deanne Drake?

11:54.848 --> 11:56.349
Yeah?
-NIKKI: FBI.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.885
Hell, no.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.793
How about a hand, please?

12:05.859 --> 12:08.128
Punch her.
She's a girl!

12:08.195 --> 12:11.098
Girl must mean something
different in Idaho.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.470
Okay, hand, please?

12:21.141 --> 12:22.275
And something to remember
when that

12:22.342 --> 12:24.044
next funny remark
comes in your head.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.716
Got your Glock nines,

12:29.783 --> 12:31.584
Walter P .22,

12:31.651 --> 12:32.719
Beretta .25,

12:32.786 --> 12:33.787
If you're going in close,

12:33.854 --> 12:36.924
drop a silencer on this puppy,
and you're like a whisper.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.391
Dan Wesson .357

12:38.458 --> 12:40.627
Now, this is six shots,

12:40.693 --> 12:41.661
but what a six.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.030
Feel that metal on your hands.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.869
Whatever you want.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.179
Desert Eagle
50-caliber.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.081
That thing's
bigger than you are.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.682
DEALER:
Man's not lying.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.184
That's a whole lot of gun.

13:04.251 --> 13:04.985
(clicks)

13:05.052 --> 13:06.854
BUCK:
That's fine.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.890
We got a whole lot of plans.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.070
You got nothing to hold me on.

13:23.136 --> 13:27.007
How about a stolen Cadillac
you left outside the prison?

13:27.074 --> 13:29.542
I drive an F-150.

13:29.609 --> 13:30.643
Deanne, come on, you watch TV.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.445
When we find it,
you so much as

13:32.512 --> 13:34.714
sneezed in that car,
we can DNA match

13:34.781 --> 13:35.983
a booger off the dashboard.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.118
You really want to go
down that road with us?

13:38.185 --> 13:40.854
Accessory to escape is 10 to 15,

13:40.921 --> 13:43.656
especially if you look
like a bad citizen.

13:43.723 --> 13:44.657
And so far,
you don't look

13:44.724 --> 13:45.825
like a good citizen.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.494
And look, you are not

13:47.560 --> 13:50.430
the first woman to throw away
a good life on a bad man.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.300
You put it out there,
I get that.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.835
You have to put it
out there, right?

13:57.237 --> 13:59.472
But you drew a creep.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.378
You think I didn't know?

14:05.445 --> 14:07.047
Deep down?

14:07.114 --> 14:09.716
I mean, he's a looker,
but he's no actor.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.919
He's got this...

14:11.985 --> 14:15.355
way about him.

14:17.190 --> 14:21.394
The way he looks at you,
it just...

14:23.396 --> 14:25.732
How'd you get the floss in?

14:25.798 --> 14:26.699
What?

14:26.766 --> 14:27.767
The dental floss.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.237
He wanted a car,

14:30.303 --> 14:33.706
three changes of clothes...

14:33.773 --> 14:34.841
Wait...

14:34.908 --> 14:37.344
What? Dental floss?

14:43.883 --> 14:44.884
She says she set the car,

14:44.952 --> 14:46.519
but she doesn't know
where they are.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.057
Okay, write it up.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.093
Hey, boss?

14:53.160 --> 14:55.195
Look, for what it's worth,

14:55.262 --> 14:57.864
I think you did what you
had to do with that kid.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.066
You know, you made
some hard choices,

14:59.132 --> 15:00.767
but you were on the side
of the angels.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.403
Hmm.

15:08.175 --> 15:11.211
So, has California Corrections

15:11.278 --> 15:13.446
given us more details
on trash procedures?

15:13.513 --> 15:15.682
No, I'm still waiting.
-One has to admire

15:15.748 --> 15:18.151
the ingenuity at work here.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.521
I mean, creating the unexpected
out of the mundane,

15:21.588 --> 15:23.323
I mean,
it's like Robinson Crusoe.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.492
Professor
on Gilligan's Island.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.594
Similar circumstance.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.597
Necessity plus
freedom from distraction.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.200
Oh, I don't know,
there was Mary Ann.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.535
Smart man, staying
away from Ginger.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.204
LARRY: Hey, speaking of
choosing one's words,

15:37.270 --> 15:38.338
have you spoken with Don?

15:38.405 --> 15:42.109
Uh, if he wants
to talk about this case,

15:42.175 --> 15:45.378
he'll get around to it,
you know?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.747
How about you?
How are you doing?

15:47.814 --> 15:50.250
This must bring up some stuff.

15:50.317 --> 15:51.918
Megan's kidnapping...

15:51.985 --> 15:54.887
Um...

15:54.954 --> 15:57.857
Yeah.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.360
Ah, yet again,
male communication

16:00.427 --> 16:03.663
tests the limits of Shannon's
source coding theorem.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.533
Granting you that,

16:06.599 --> 16:09.236
I will inelegantly
reintroduce the idea

16:09.302 --> 16:10.837
of bringing Alan
into the think tank.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.205
Uh, yeah, sure...

16:12.272 --> 16:15.408
because he and I don't spend
enough time together

16:15.475 --> 16:17.744
under the same roof,
or at the same school.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.285
Okay, I was seven years old,

16:25.352 --> 16:27.287
and I asked my dad
if he could help me

16:27.354 --> 16:29.522
figure out a good estimate

16:29.589 --> 16:31.824
for the remainder term
in a Taylor expansion

16:31.891 --> 16:33.560
of the hyperbolic cosine.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.695
Our eyes met

16:35.762 --> 16:37.664
and there was this...

16:37.730 --> 16:41.134
tacit understanding
that we had crossed the Rubicon.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.603
When you're
seven years old,

16:43.670 --> 16:46.873
your dad should be
seven feet tall.

16:46.939 --> 16:52.112
So, I separated
math from my dad.

16:52.179 --> 16:55.682
As irrational as it sounds,
I'd prefer to keep it that way.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.153
Oh, I'm just
surprised that you,

17:00.220 --> 17:01.688
uh, even have
time for me today.

17:01.754 --> 17:05.625
I mean, uh, what with Buck
Winters on the loose.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.628
Well, you know, there's this
thing called the Internet now.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.662
They give you the news.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.731
You don't have to worry, Dad,
it's all all right.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.101
That's a fairly
ridiculous statement.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.837
I know you're, uh, capable
of taking care of yourself.

17:17.904 --> 17:24.077
What bothers me is this, uh,
strange detachment of yours.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.812
That's what
this looks like?

17:25.878 --> 17:26.913
Really?

17:26.979 --> 17:29.015
Detachment?

17:29.082 --> 17:31.017
I'm your father,
I can't help it.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.052
I just, um...

17:33.120 --> 17:34.887
I'm, uh...

17:34.954 --> 17:37.090
scared.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.429
Look, I'm scared
that if I go out there,

17:42.495 --> 17:44.297
I'm going to have
to kill this kid.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.072
Eight to nine months.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.607
That's it?
No bells, no whistles?

17:54.674 --> 17:56.476
CHARLIE: Oh, no,
I mean, I tracked

17:56.543 --> 17:58.578
the rates of floss being
stolen from the infirmary,

17:58.645 --> 17:59.446
allowed for

17:59.512 --> 18:01.548
parallel escape plans,
blah, blah, blah.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.184
But ask me what's really
interesting about this rope.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.185
Charlie, what's
really interesting

18:05.252 --> 18:06.219
about this rope?

18:06.286 --> 18:08.155
Boy, I'm glad you asked.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.157
Floss is generally fabricated

18:10.223 --> 18:12.959
from bundles of nylon
or Teflon filaments.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.427
It's produced
in different

18:14.494 --> 18:16.229
decitexes and thicknesses.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.497
Which makes some brands
stronger than others.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.465
And sharper.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.234
You know, you build this
rope with the wrong floss,

18:21.301 --> 18:22.535
it's not going to
sustain body weight,

18:22.602 --> 18:23.970
or it's gonna
cut your hands.

18:24.036 --> 18:25.305
Lab had the same idea.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.640
They didn't find any blood
anywhere on the rope.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.276
Exactly.
You know, all my models indicate

18:29.342 --> 18:30.510
that there was
no trial and error,

18:30.577 --> 18:32.479
so, this rope wasn't built;

18:32.545 --> 18:34.314
this rope was engineered.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.583
Which requires a certain
amount of aptitude.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.651
Expertise.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.087
Which is none
of our three guys.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.889
Excuse me.

18:44.991 --> 18:45.992
Hey.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.427
Hey.
-What's up, bro?

18:47.494 --> 18:49.128
You don't write,
you don't call.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.197
You know how it is.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.464
I thought David
was filling you in.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.699
Yeah, he filled us in.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.834
Dental floss.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.304
So, we, uh, found an
interesting, uh, connection.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.805
All right, good.

19:06.413 --> 19:09.549
(knocking on door)

19:11.284 --> 19:12.585
Tim Pynchon?

19:12.652 --> 19:13.786
FBI.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.357
It's the shoes.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.995
This 'cause I, uh, celled
with Gray McClaughlin, right?

19:23.062 --> 19:24.497
Until 10 months ago, yeah.

19:24.564 --> 19:25.732
Yeah, hit the DNA lottery.

19:25.798 --> 19:26.833
Thank LAPD

19:26.899 --> 19:28.201
for mislabeling evidence.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.704
You can do a phone dump,
toss my capacious abode.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.039
Seems like a
long way down

19:33.105 --> 19:34.374
for a guy who's
used to pulling

19:34.441 --> 19:36.042
six- and seven-figure
takedowns.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.477
Yeah, I guess high end
burglaries don't really

19:37.544 --> 19:39.612
prepare you for the contemporary
job market, do they?

19:40.713 --> 19:41.748
It's all computers these days.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.516
DAVID: Yeah, well,
you do strike us

19:43.583 --> 19:44.684
as the kind of guy
that would put together

19:44.751 --> 19:46.553
a bulletproof
escape plan--

19:46.619 --> 19:48.788
design a rope ladder
out of dental floss.

19:50.757 --> 19:53.326
You know who doesn't
strike us that way?

19:53.393 --> 19:55.027
Gray McClaughlin?
Rafe Lansky?

19:55.094 --> 19:56.663
Buck Winters?

20:02.602 --> 20:05.372
You guys gonna give me
some love if this is

20:05.438 --> 20:06.673
a "what if"
conversation?

20:06.739 --> 20:09.776
Well, I'd say that
depends on the "what if."

20:10.677 --> 20:12.445
What if a guy is looking at 15

20:12.512 --> 20:14.213
for a Bel Air vault
he didn't blow?

20:14.281 --> 20:17.350
Spends two years
figuring his way out.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.485
As an intellectual exercise.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.152
DAVID: Does this guy
include his cellmate

20:20.219 --> 20:21.488
in this "intellectual exercise"?

20:21.554 --> 20:22.722
Kind of rude not to.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.391
So, what if
he finds out

20:24.457 --> 20:25.858
he's going home
and his cellie offers him

20:25.925 --> 20:26.893
5 G's for the plan?

20:26.959 --> 20:31.331
Where's McClaughlin
come up with five grand?

20:31.398 --> 20:33.766
He used to deal
with a guy named Nestor--

20:33.833 --> 20:34.701
Ruiz, Luiz--

20:34.767 --> 20:37.003
that's the kind of guy
that might hide him out

20:37.069 --> 20:38.438
in this "what if" scenario.

20:40.707 --> 20:44.611
So, how many things about that
conversation didn't you like?

20:44.677 --> 20:46.112
Well, aside from cooperating

20:46.178 --> 20:47.547
before we even
got in the door,

20:47.614 --> 20:49.582
confessing sideways
to two felonies,

20:49.649 --> 20:51.951
then pointing us in the
direction of another guy?

20:52.018 --> 20:53.353
Yeah, aside from that.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.754
A six-figure safecracker

20:54.821 --> 20:57.256
uh, he risks his
dumb luck release

20:57.324 --> 20:58.658
for pocket money.

20:58.725 --> 21:03.330
I think I'm still kind of stuck
on that comment about my shoes.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.545
I'm standing here hoping
that a 19-year-old boy

21:18.611 --> 21:21.514
is gonna get himself
stabbed in a bar fight

21:21.581 --> 21:24.083
or OD in an alley.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.918
I once stood not
far from here,

21:25.985 --> 21:29.589
wishing a similar end
to the woman he loved.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.392
Because she
threatened

21:32.459 --> 21:34.060
someone I cared for.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.364
Made me feel...
just helpless.

21:39.031 --> 21:42.602
I came to realize that if her
actions seemed unfathomable,

21:42.669 --> 21:44.671
her motives weren't.

21:44.737 --> 21:48.875
I don't want to know why
that kid is the way that he is.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.810
Well, in cosmology,

21:50.877 --> 21:54.647
the Arrow of Time points
in the direction of expansion;

21:54.714 --> 21:57.817
and if the universe decides
to contract one day...

21:57.884 --> 22:01.187
The past is going
to come looking for us

22:01.253 --> 22:03.122
whether we want it to or not?

22:03.189 --> 22:04.391
Well, cosmologists argue

22:04.457 --> 22:09.696
that the future will continue
to move in the same direction.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.932
But perhaps the universe has...

22:12.999 --> 22:14.734
a more open mind.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.879
I wish Pynchon would make
a move already.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.454
Which apartment
are we staring at?

22:34.521 --> 22:35.622
Up the stairs,

22:35.688 --> 22:37.256
hallway on the right.

22:37.323 --> 22:39.592
Hope you girls didn't have
any big plans for tonight.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.994
Nah, just this photo
I got to e-mail to Idaho.

22:42.061 --> 22:45.698
And that would be him.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.568
Where's he going?
-There's an exit

22:48.635 --> 22:50.102
up on the third floor in that
middle archway.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.370
It dumps out on Loma.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.573
(engine starting)
All right, got it.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.289
(door opens and closes)

23:10.356 --> 23:12.859
Think he went
into another apartment.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.527
NIKKI (over radio):
Forty.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.695
Borrowing a cup of sugar?

23:15.762 --> 23:17.930
Borrowing the landlady?

23:17.997 --> 23:19.566
LIZ:
There's a window on the street.

23:19.632 --> 23:20.867
We're gonna go
check it out.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.707
PYNCHON (muffled): We've got
to get you out of here.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.141
First, the landlady's
asking questions,

23:29.208 --> 23:31.478
then the FBI is here.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.412
Cops!

23:35.381 --> 23:37.750
LIZ:
Shots fired.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.986
They're coming your way.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.990
(groaning)

24:19.391 --> 24:20.993
(gun clicking)

24:31.470 --> 24:33.005
You all right?
-DAVID: Yeah.

24:33.072 --> 24:36.676
He was kind enough
to break my fall.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.678
Good for him.

24:41.948 --> 24:43.883
(phone ringing)

24:53.025 --> 24:54.761
Eppes.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.262
We have McClaughlin.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.864
(phone ringing)

24:59.398 --> 25:01.033
Yeah,

25:01.100 --> 25:03.803
keep me posted.

25:05.204 --> 25:05.972
Eppes.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.007
BUCK:
Do you know who this is?

25:10.042 --> 25:10.977
Yep.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.246
Then you know what I want.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.892
So, Winters called you
from a burner cell.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.760
Untraceable,
but if he calls you again,

25:27.827 --> 25:30.162
the tech boys'll try
and get a triangulation.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.632
Okay, thanks.

25:32.699 --> 25:36.202
Two minute and 38 second
conversation.

25:36.268 --> 25:37.637
What'd you two fellas
talk about?

25:37.704 --> 25:40.239
About what you'd expect.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.277
I'm trying
to figure out

25:45.344 --> 25:48.815
if this is eating you up
or you're being a tool.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.617
It can't be both?

25:52.518 --> 25:54.654
Put everything else aside,
okay?

25:54.721 --> 25:56.856
You've got an office
full of people

25:56.923 --> 25:59.525
who are trying to take down
two escaped killers.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.828
And it'd be
pretty screwed-up

26:01.894 --> 26:04.063
if our biggest obstacle
was our boss.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.933
I'll try to stay
out of your way.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.005
NIKKI: How'd you get Pynchon
to hide you out?

26:13.072 --> 26:15.174
You stare
at the same walls

26:15.241 --> 26:18.177
and you hear the same stories
for 23 hours a day,

26:18.244 --> 26:21.447
and so I tell Pynchon
about some drug stash

26:21.513 --> 26:23.783
that the cops didn't find
on my last pinch.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.918
This is when he finds
out about Nestor?

26:25.985 --> 26:28.788
There isn't a Nestor.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.189
It's a jail story--
you know,

26:30.256 --> 26:33.225
hidden drug stash, buried pirate
treasure-- same difference.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.728
I tell you, for a smart guy,
Pynchon believed

26:35.795 --> 26:37.296
what he wanted
to believe.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.297
You know?

26:38.364 --> 26:39.098
He got obsessed,

26:39.165 --> 26:40.833
started planning
his way out,

26:40.900 --> 26:43.035
and then after he jackpotted
that appeal,

26:43.102 --> 26:44.804
he got obsessed
with me getting out

26:44.871 --> 26:46.773
and leading him
to the buried treasure.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.540
And you strung
him along.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.809
Uh, him and Deanne.

26:49.876 --> 26:53.813
Is anyone really surprised
by my lack of character?

26:53.880 --> 26:55.081
And Buck and Rafe?

26:55.147 --> 26:56.816
Guys like those,

26:56.883 --> 26:58.685
you go your separate way

26:58.751 --> 26:59.786
as soon as you can.

26:59.852 --> 27:00.687
And where's
their separate way?

27:00.753 --> 27:02.254
I have my theories.

27:02.321 --> 27:03.690
NIKKI:
Such as?

27:03.756 --> 27:05.224
Such as...

27:05.291 --> 27:06.826
what kind of deal
are we going to make?

27:06.893 --> 27:08.560
ROBIN:
Here's your deal.

27:08.627 --> 27:09.528
Accessory after the fact.

27:09.595 --> 27:10.763
To what?

27:10.830 --> 27:13.199
Everything-- you
facilitated an escape,

27:13.265 --> 27:16.836
which means that you are
culpable for every crime

27:16.903 --> 27:19.038
that I can prove
as a result of that escape.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.873
Winters and Lansky--
they steal a car?

27:20.940 --> 27:22.675
It's on you.

27:22.742 --> 27:23.743
They rob a bank?

27:23.810 --> 27:24.744
It's like you were
driving the car.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.012
They kill a federal agent?

27:26.078 --> 27:30.249
I got good seats in the gallery,
watching them cook you.

27:32.551 --> 27:34.420
ROBIN:
Go ahead, doubt me.

27:34.486 --> 27:38.457
Put your little jailhouse
law degree against mine.

27:38.524 --> 27:41.227
And then take a look at the
clock and try to figure out

27:41.293 --> 27:43.963
how many more crimes your
partners are putting on your tab

27:44.030 --> 27:45.932
while you sit there
and don't talk.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.842
Buck wants to kill some cop,
but Rafe doesn't want to.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.543
Buck the alpha dog?

27:57.609 --> 27:58.610
When the kid made a deal
with Rafe,

27:58.677 --> 28:01.313
everybody figured that,
you know, it was what it was--

28:01.380 --> 28:02.614
fish staying alive
behind some muscle--

28:02.681 --> 28:04.516
but then after a while,
you just,

28:04.583 --> 28:05.684
you couldn't tell anymore.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.720
Was it love,
maybe something else?

28:07.787 --> 28:09.155
So where are they?

28:14.761 --> 28:16.729
Starline Motel.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.931
At least that's
where they were.

28:22.268 --> 28:26.005
All I've got in my trunk is
a blanket and a flashlight.

28:27.339 --> 28:30.409
Looks like, uh,
you're hunting bear.

28:31.510 --> 28:34.180
No, uh, actually, I like bears.

28:37.616 --> 28:41.553
You know, Mr. Eppes, it's not
a good time right now.

28:41.620 --> 28:42.588
Don's kind of busy.

28:42.654 --> 28:44.056
Yeah, yeah, I
know, I know.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.792
Um...

28:47.827 --> 28:51.097
Um, David...

28:51.163 --> 28:53.232
you've known Donnie
longer than anyone.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.734
Y-You know, um...

28:55.802 --> 28:57.970
I...

29:01.440 --> 29:03.943
I-I didn't do everything
right, you know.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.444
You'll see, when
you have kids,

29:05.511 --> 29:10.349
i-it's practically impossible
to get everything... right.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.319
But I think
that I-I've...

29:13.385 --> 29:14.320
Don't worry.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.825
I'll take care of him.

29:18.891 --> 29:21.794
Okay?

29:21.861 --> 29:22.995
Okay.

29:36.342 --> 29:37.977
Hey.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.247
Ah, Viterbi algorithms.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.916
Hey, I thought you said
they were for suckers.

29:45.384 --> 29:49.655
I had this idea about predicting
Buck Winters' next move.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.757
It sort of drifted a bit.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.392
Tell me it isn't right.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.828
Hey...

29:57.897 --> 30:00.332
Have you spoken
to Don about this?

30:00.399 --> 30:02.701
No.

30:02.768 --> 30:04.871
But I'm going to.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.960
Hey, Sinclair, nice of you
to invite us this time.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.896
LIZ:
So, it's room seven.

30:29.962 --> 30:30.897
Manager's
pretty sure

30:30.963 --> 30:31.797
they're still inside.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.232
Because?
-He knocked on the door

30:33.299 --> 30:35.868
this morning for, quote:
one big-ass fight,

30:35.935 --> 30:37.536
end quote;
and Buck answered,

30:37.603 --> 30:39.371
apologized, gave him a
50 to forget about it.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.840
LIZ: Their car is still
parked in front of the unit.

30:41.908 --> 30:43.976
'75 Caddy,
comes back stolen.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.844
All right, so...

30:47.279 --> 30:50.116
...this unit here,
bathroom window here.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.055
THIBODEAUX:
Here, back here!

31:01.493 --> 31:04.964
COLBY: Looks like Buck
broke his heart.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.580
Hey, so, um...

31:21.647 --> 31:24.150
there's this thing called
a Viterbi algorithm.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.519
It's a way of finding
the most probable sequence

31:27.586 --> 31:29.355
of hidden states.

31:29.421 --> 31:30.889
Hidden states.

31:30.957 --> 31:33.259
There's a guy,
he does three things--

31:33.325 --> 31:35.027
he sleeps, he eats,
and he hunts--

31:35.094 --> 31:37.296
and he chooses which one
of those three things to do

31:37.363 --> 31:41.400
based on the season, the time
of day, and the weather.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.336
Now, if we can only see this man
and know what he's doing

31:44.403 --> 31:47.239
at a singular moment,
frozen in time,

31:47.306 --> 31:49.641
what the Viterbi algorithm does
is it tells us

31:49.708 --> 31:53.379
what the whole world looks like
at that moment.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.414
I used a similar approach
with Buck Winters.

31:55.481 --> 31:56.682
I tried to predict
his actions,

31:56.748 --> 32:00.786
specifically those that could be
inferred by the states

32:00.852 --> 32:03.322
of "Buck hiding from the cops,"
"Buck with a gun"...

32:03.389 --> 32:05.424
"Buck trying to kill Don."

32:05.491 --> 32:08.927
You already know
where to find Buck Winters.

32:08.995 --> 32:12.098
Why didn't you call me
when you found out he escaped?

32:12.164 --> 32:13.265
I don't really see
much math here.

32:13.332 --> 32:14.666
Five years down the road,

32:14.733 --> 32:17.003
you still don't realize
that there's always math?

32:18.237 --> 32:20.306
What the hell is wrong with you?

32:20.372 --> 32:24.676
I didn't have a choice
with Crystal.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.081
I think about this sermon
I heard the other day,

32:29.148 --> 32:32.551
this, uh... verse
they were talking about--

32:32.618 --> 32:34.620
the natach lach.

32:34.686 --> 32:37.223
At least the way I
understood it was--

32:37.289 --> 32:42.461
you know--
"What's in your hand?"

32:42.528 --> 32:46.132
What are the things
that you can control?

32:46.198 --> 32:47.166
Hey, how are you
controlling

32:47.233 --> 32:49.368
the situation
by shutting me out?

32:51.270 --> 32:53.605
In perceptual terms,

32:53.672 --> 32:57.943
memory can only be increased
as correlations increase.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.445
You understand?
That the Arrow of Time

32:59.511 --> 33:02.381
can only take you
from the past to the future;

33:02.448 --> 33:05.184
that what you do tonight,
what you do tomorrow--

33:05.251 --> 33:07.719
it won't put the bullet
back in that gun.

33:07.786 --> 33:11.023
You ought to think about
what you're about to do.

33:12.691 --> 33:16.162
Think about the regrets
you'll have two years from now.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.602
There's auto glass all
over the curb out back.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.437
Looks like Buck
stole another car.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.339
Well, crime techs think
Rafe was cold-cocked,

33:27.406 --> 33:29.575
dragged to the bathtub,
and shot there.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.510
Sure, then he climbs
out the bathroom window

33:31.577 --> 33:32.611
so the manager
doesn't see him;

33:32.678 --> 33:35.214
steals a new car so
he's got a head start.

33:37.649 --> 33:40.552
Recovered Winters' burner
from a Dumpster

33:40.619 --> 33:41.587
four blocks away.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.855
I think he was watching
us hit his room.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.457
He was waiting for Don.

33:45.524 --> 33:46.658
You start a dump?
-Already on it.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.827
In the meantime, we pulled
the last few numbers

33:48.894 --> 33:49.828
off the memory.

33:49.895 --> 33:52.030
You gotta see this.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.936
That's Don's cell.

33:58.003 --> 33:59.238
Why didn't he...?

33:59.305 --> 34:01.240
That number is incoming,
not outgoing.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.746
Don called Buck.

34:19.258 --> 34:21.660
Buck calls you through
the FBI switchboard...

34:21.727 --> 34:25.197
you guys speak
for two-plus minutes;

34:25.264 --> 34:27.533
you tell us
nothing but B.S. threats.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.535
I say, okay.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.605
You ever think to mention
he gave you his phone number?

34:33.672 --> 34:36.475
That motel lead came in,
he'd have been there,

34:36.542 --> 34:38.344
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

34:38.410 --> 34:41.113
Well, here we are...
having this conversation.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.615
You called him.

34:43.682 --> 34:45.317
You called him out.

34:45.384 --> 34:47.319
You scramble
a five-man tac team.

34:47.386 --> 34:48.854
You tell the marshals...

34:48.920 --> 34:49.588
You don't get to do that.

34:49.655 --> 34:52.124
You can't play it off
like you got

34:52.191 --> 34:54.293
some kind of clear head
about this.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.329
Taking the back seat,

34:57.396 --> 35:00.499
sleepwalking your way
through this investigation--

35:00.566 --> 35:03.769
you know, I kind of get that.

35:03.835 --> 35:04.836
Don!

35:06.272 --> 35:08.907
You withheld information.

35:08.974 --> 35:09.841
You got two choices.

35:09.908 --> 35:13.879
You can turn me in,
or you can let me lead.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.682
What are you doing?

35:16.748 --> 35:18.584
Even on your darkest
damned day,

35:18.650 --> 35:21.620
you never pulled any kind
of High Noon crap like this.

35:23.989 --> 35:25.524
Listen to me.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.059
Whatever you see,
whatever goes down,

35:28.126 --> 35:30.061
nobody moves
until I signal.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.763
Mm-mm...

35:31.830 --> 35:34.566
Whatever you see.

35:35.767 --> 35:38.437
I told your father
I would keep you alive.

35:40.539 --> 35:43.475
You will not make a liar
out of me.

35:48.780 --> 35:52.751
Well, word around Cal Sci
is that tomorrow's hot ticket

35:52.818 --> 35:56.388
is a lecture on
time-reversible chaotic systems

35:56.455 --> 35:57.923
by Professor
Charles Eppes.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.325
CHARLIE:
Right, uh...

35:59.391 --> 36:00.626
Although, I think
earlier today,

36:00.692 --> 36:03.362
I may have argued
against my own point with Don.

36:03.429 --> 36:04.663
Metaphorically
speaking, anyhow.

36:04.730 --> 36:09.635
I guess I'm sort of stuck
on the Arrow of Time.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.303
You know,
I had a related musing.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.538
Clearly, we are

36:12.604 --> 36:14.940
circling around
some underlying truth here.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.943
Don versus entropy.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.778
Where's Maxwell's Demon
when you need him?

36:19.845 --> 36:21.146
Maxwell's Demon?

36:21.213 --> 36:23.615
Yeah, you know,

36:23.682 --> 36:26.285
the man who stands alone
at the door,

36:26.352 --> 36:28.587
between two adjoining rooms.

36:30.756 --> 36:34.192
The temperature
and the pressure are the same.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.368
It's a perfect state
of equilibrium.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.437
(door squeaking)

36:46.805 --> 36:47.706
I've got him.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.941
SOG Bravo
has the shot.

36:50.008 --> 36:51.042
Stand by.

36:51.109 --> 36:52.711
Stand by for what?

36:52.778 --> 36:54.646
Don's calling the
signals on this one.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.416
CHARLIE: Each time the Demon
opens the door,

36:57.483 --> 37:00.419
he admits only the molecules
that he chooses,

37:00.486 --> 37:02.388
heating the one room

37:02.454 --> 37:04.256
and cooling the other.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.258
It's a direct violation

37:06.325 --> 37:08.260
of the second law
of thermodynamics.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.862
COLBY: SOG Charlie,
we have the shot, too.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.399
10-4. SOG Charlie.

37:13.465 --> 37:17.135
Everyone stands by for my call.

37:17.202 --> 37:20.806
CHARLIE: So, the Demon not only
opens the door to two rooms,

37:20.872 --> 37:26.011
he allows for the possibility
of perpetual motion.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.112
Should have a gun in your hands.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.848
Unless you came
here to die.

37:29.915 --> 37:34.353
And the rearranging of
everything we know to be real.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.289
I loved her.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.724
I know you did.

37:38.790 --> 37:42.694
You made me betray her...
and then you killed her.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.734
SOG Bravo has a visual
on the gun.

37:48.800 --> 37:53.038
SOG Charlie--
we have a clear shot.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.173
Everyone stands by for my call.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.208
BUCK:
I wake up every day

37:57.275 --> 37:59.277
and think about
how I failed her.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.714
I sold her out...

38:02.781 --> 38:05.851
for some bruises
and broken bones.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.853
I was weak.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.923
I had to get strong.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.293
You did that for me.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.528
You and Rafe.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.096
Is that why you killed him?

38:18.163 --> 38:20.866
I killed him
because he was afraid to die!

38:20.932 --> 38:23.268
You're not truly
hard on the inside

38:23.335 --> 38:26.572
until you're willing to give up
everything that you love!

38:26.638 --> 38:28.574
To give your life away.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.577
He never realized
that my future

38:31.643 --> 38:34.079
wasn't his to decide.

38:34.145 --> 38:37.248
Or maybe he figured it out
in the last few seconds.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.084
I don't know.

38:48.860 --> 38:52.097
You've got three seconds
to go for it.

38:55.200 --> 38:58.704
It's not going
to be that way, Buck.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.209
DAVID: Adam and Charlie,
we're going in.

39:04.275 --> 39:06.044
Bravo, hold your position.

39:21.527 --> 39:23.228
That's 180 bullets
looking at you.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.063
You're not even gonna
get that thing out of your belt.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.932
You think I care?

39:28.434 --> 39:30.135
Two years
planning this,

39:30.201 --> 39:32.971
and you let me choose
the time and place?

39:34.072 --> 39:36.207
I know you care.

39:36.274 --> 39:39.277
You didn't come here
for a fair fight.

39:39.344 --> 39:41.947
You didn't come here to kill me.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.882
You came here to die

39:43.949 --> 39:47.052
the same way
Crystal did.

39:47.118 --> 39:49.087
I had to kill her, Buck.

39:51.189 --> 39:53.124
I don't have to kill you.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.594
Why?!

39:55.661 --> 39:58.229
Why can't you
do this for me?!

39:58.296 --> 40:00.999
You owe me this!

40:01.066 --> 40:04.135
I'm 19 years old!

40:04.202 --> 40:05.571
They gave me 250 years!

40:05.637 --> 40:08.640
You don't know
what that's like.

40:08.707 --> 40:11.409
To have to pay for things
that I can't take back.

40:11.477 --> 40:13.044
Yeah, I know what that's like.

40:13.111 --> 40:15.046
(wry laugh)

40:15.113 --> 40:17.182
That's just life.

40:17.248 --> 40:20.218
You want to die?

40:20.285 --> 40:21.152
That's your choice.

40:21.219 --> 40:24.089
But you don't get to decide
how I live with it.

40:32.498 --> 40:35.100
(sobbing)

40:37.503 --> 40:40.171
(screaming)

40:44.242 --> 40:46.478
(sobbing)

40:59.090 --> 41:02.460
Well, that's like just
so much hokum, isn't it?

41:02.528 --> 41:03.662
Hokum...

41:03.729 --> 41:05.130
ALAN: Well, I mean,
Maxwell's Demon

41:05.196 --> 41:07.032
is a thought experiment, right?

41:07.098 --> 41:08.900
Yeah.
-Well, granted, there are

41:08.967 --> 41:10.902
theoretical applications,
I'm sure, but, um,

41:10.969 --> 41:14.372
when the window breaks, the
cold air still rushes in.

41:14.439 --> 41:16.842
Gears fail, oil leaks.

41:16.908 --> 41:20.145
Sooner or later,
that engine is gonna break down.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.180
(Buck wailing)

41:25.183 --> 41:27.185
I know that wasn't easy.

41:29.120 --> 41:32.057
You know, most days,
I wouldn't think twice.

41:33.358 --> 41:35.894
No.

41:35.961 --> 41:37.929
Not easy.

41:43.702 --> 41:46.104
Hey, Dad, a bunch
of us at Cal Sci

41:46.171 --> 41:48.907
were talking about putting
together a think tank,

41:48.974 --> 41:51.777
which is, you know, just
a group of us getting together

41:51.843 --> 41:55.614
once a month
and kicking around ideas, and...

41:55.681 --> 41:58.349
we were wondering
if you might be interested

41:58.416 --> 42:00.151
in joining our group.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.056
You know,
I still remember the time

42:05.123 --> 42:07.158
when you asked me
for, um, an estimate

42:07.225 --> 42:08.760
on the remainder term

42:08.827 --> 42:11.797
for a Taylor expansion
of the hyperbolic cosine.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.599
AMITA:
That's a very specific

42:13.665 --> 42:14.866
memory, Alan.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.101
One never forgets
the moments when

42:16.167 --> 42:17.936
one realizes
that he has nothing left

42:18.003 --> 42:20.038
to teach his seven-year-old son
about math.

42:23.408 --> 42:26.645
Well, yeah, but...

42:26.712 --> 42:27.813
look at everything else

42:27.879 --> 42:29.581
you've taught me about
since then.

42:32.517 --> 42:36.121
I think you've just given me
another very specific memory.

42:38.556 --> 42:39.691
To our new venture.

42:39.758 --> 42:42.393
And to the causal Arrow of Time.

42:42.460 --> 42:44.029
(mugs clinking)

42:45.396 --> 42:47.699
LARRY: Within the small sphere
of our life,

42:47.766 --> 42:49.635
we can stare into the past,

42:49.701 --> 42:53.271
but only our future
is within our control.
