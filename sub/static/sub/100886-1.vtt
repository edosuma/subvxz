WEBVTT

00:49.847 --> 00:50.815
<i>You really believe</i>

00:50.848 --> 00:52.684
<i>we can just switch out
our lives?</i>

00:54.019 --> 00:57.022
<i>The decisions we've already
made this late in the game?</i>

01:08.702 --> 01:10.870
<i>I mean, you really think
we can change?</i>

03:02.961 --> 03:03.929
<i>What makes you believe</i>

03:03.962 --> 03:05.764
<i>you'll be able
to acclimate back</i>

03:05.797 --> 03:08.801
<i>into society competently
without reoffending?</i>

03:10.635 --> 03:13.105
I'm sitting here
before you both today

03:13.139 --> 03:17.443
a fully rehabilitated person
without a doubt.

03:17.476 --> 03:22.115
I've taken ownership for
my wrongdoings in the past,

03:22.149 --> 03:24.450
and my good behavior
in here

03:24.483 --> 03:29.123
and my letter of support
acknowledges that.

03:29.157 --> 03:34.628
<i>What specific plans do you have upon
release if we grant your parole?</i>

03:34.662 --> 03:37.132
I plan to start
a new life

03:37.166 --> 03:41.303
for myself
in a more rural area,

03:41.337 --> 03:42.637
and then
I just look forward

03:42.671 --> 03:45.474
to giving back
to the community.

03:45.507 --> 03:48.311
<i>Is there anything else
you'd like to add?</i>

03:48.345 --> 03:49.645
I would really
appreciate it

03:49.679 --> 03:54.150
if you could find it
in your hearts to grant me

03:54.184 --> 03:58.689
this opportunity to start
an honest life for myself.

04:00.523 --> 04:03.160
That's all I want.

04:03.194 --> 04:05.998
<i>We'll take everything
under consideration.</i>

04:06.031 --> 04:08.200
Thank you so much
for your time.

05:06.596 --> 05:08.266
<i>Just drop me a
line, huh, playboy?</i>

05:12.771 --> 05:14.440
<i>We'll get up
when I get out.</i>

05:37.965 --> 05:39.133
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

05:39.166 --> 05:41.803
Hey, come on. Faster!
It keeps pilling up. Let's go!

05:53.316 --> 05:58.454
- Really the only job you can find?
- Yeah.

05:58.488 --> 06:01.624
<i>I... I've been
in prison before,</i>

06:01.657 --> 06:04.161
<i>so that makes it hard
to get a job.</i>

06:10.168 --> 06:12.337
<i>This is just a onetime thing.
Cool?</i>

06:13.505 --> 06:15.673
Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

06:17.842 --> 06:18.843
<i>Good night.</i>

06:36.696 --> 06:37.998
<i>Look, I'm just...
I'm looking after you, okay?</i>

06:38.031 --> 06:39.067
<i>No,
you're not looking after me.</i>

06:39.100 --> 06:40.068
- <i>You're young.</i>
- <i>You're micromanaging me...</i>

06:40.101 --> 06:41.202
<i>Look, just calm down,
all right?</i>

06:41.235 --> 06:43.004
I just want you to go on and do your
job, all right?

06:43.037 --> 06:45.540
- I'm doing my job!
- All right, just calm... all right!

06:52.214 --> 06:53.348
Hello?

06:53.382 --> 06:54.683
<i>Yeah, can I speak</i>

06:54.716 --> 06:57.186
<i>to motherfucking Patrick,
please?</i>

06:57.219 --> 06:58.354
Who is this?

06:58.388 --> 07:02.525
<i>Man, don't break my heart.
I just got out, man.</i>

07:02.559 --> 07:04.360
Haha, Dolph.

07:04.394 --> 07:06.529
<i>Yeah, I'm finally
up out of there.</i>

07:06.563 --> 07:08.232
<i>I heard you was in L.A.</i>

07:09.567 --> 07:11.368
- <i>Hello?</i>
- That's cool, man.

07:11.402 --> 07:13.537
Um, let me know when
you get out here,

07:13.571 --> 07:14.538
and I'll show you around.

07:14.572 --> 07:16.207
<i>Hell yeah, you will.</i>

07:16.240 --> 07:18.543
<i>Shit, everything good
over there?</i>

07:18.577 --> 07:20.378
Shh, it could be worse.

07:20.412 --> 07:22.414
<i>That plan you talked about.
Let's do it.</i>

07:24.082 --> 07:25.584
<i>It's time to make
some money, man.</i>

07:26.419 --> 07:27.887
You haven't
changed a bit.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.722
Hey, baby,
people don't change, man.

07:29.755 --> 07:32.225
Shit.

07:32.258 --> 07:34.227
You know, smoking's
actually illegal

07:34.260 --> 07:37.397
in certain areas
in L.A.

07:37.431 --> 07:38.765
- For real?
- Yeah.

07:39.933 --> 07:40.901
Hey, they're
gonna have more

07:40.934 --> 07:41.902
than smoke
to worry about

07:41.935 --> 07:43.737
after we're finish with they
asses, right?

07:45.273 --> 07:47.242
Hey, but this place is nice as
shit, though.

07:47.275 --> 07:49.244
Yeah, it's nice.
I like it.

07:49.277 --> 07:51.746
I wonder where they get all
this goddamn money from.

07:51.779 --> 07:54.415
Just people using people out
here, man.

07:54.449 --> 07:55.618
- That's all it is.
- Mm.

07:56.952 --> 07:58.954
Well, we're gonna fit
right on in.

08:00.122 --> 08:01.290
Oh, yeah.

08:02.124 --> 08:03.759
What you
been up to, bro?

08:03.792 --> 08:05.428
Just, you know,

08:05.462 --> 08:07.931
trying keep to the
straight and narrow.

08:07.964 --> 08:09.266
<i>So you'd rather be broke</i>

08:09.299 --> 08:11.568
<i>and stay broke instead of
making some quick fucking cash?</i>

08:11.601 --> 08:12.569
<i>Now, that's
the real prison.</i>

08:14.272 --> 08:15.573
<i>I know the real you.</i>

08:15.606 --> 08:17.441
<i>A damn criminal,
just like me.</i>

08:20.611 --> 08:22.580
<i>Come on, man,
you ain't seen your boy in a minute.</i>

08:22.613 --> 08:23.615
<i>Just indulge me.</i>

08:24.616 --> 08:26.585
I don't know,
maybe get close

08:26.618 --> 08:27.920
to one of these
trophy wives

08:27.953 --> 08:31.924
<i>until you have access
to her rich husband's money.</i>

08:31.957 --> 08:33.426
<i>See,
that's what I'm talking about, man.</i>

08:33.459 --> 08:35.094
You're a single
con artist, man.

08:35.128 --> 08:36.262
No hesitation.

08:36.296 --> 08:37.597
There's a lot of them out
here, man.

08:37.630 --> 08:39.265
Don't know how
good they got it.

08:39.299 --> 08:40.667
Check it out.

08:40.700 --> 08:45.105
Get them to committing,
they have something to lose right there.

08:45.139 --> 08:46.774
Throw them in the back of a van.

08:46.807 --> 08:48.943
Husband forks over the dough.

08:48.976 --> 08:51.779
We good.
Easy money.

08:51.812 --> 08:53.815
Man, we'll be set
for the long haul, man.

08:56.818 --> 08:59.287
I'm not going back to
that life because... hey!

08:59.321 --> 09:01.122
It's life
if we get caught.

09:01.156 --> 09:02.124
Man, fuck prison.

09:02.158 --> 09:03.459
- I'm with you on that.
- Yeah.

09:03.492 --> 09:05.828
But don't forget you had me
protecting you in there, man.

09:07.330 --> 09:10.967
And like you said,
you owe me.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.302
Your words.

09:12.336 --> 09:14.638
You're talking
about kidnapping.

09:14.671 --> 09:15.806
Do you know what
that means?

09:15.839 --> 09:18.642
Ain't nothing gonna
happen to nobody.

09:18.675 --> 09:19.977
Believe me.

09:20.010 --> 09:22.814
Didn't I make sure ain't nothing
happened to you in prison?

09:22.847 --> 09:23.848
Huh?

09:26.851 --> 09:27.852
Yes or no?

09:29.854 --> 09:30.856
Yeah.

09:31.190 --> 09:32.358
Bet.

09:34.860 --> 09:36.829
Now, partner,
when I get back,

09:36.862 --> 09:38.163
we're gonna have to get
the fuck up out of here

09:38.197 --> 09:39.498
'cause we ain't
paying for this.

09:43.704 --> 09:45.038
Man, look.

09:45.706 --> 09:47.540
We're gonna need some
upfront money too.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.882
It felt so real
at the time.

10:24.915 --> 10:29.254
He had really convinced
me that we were in love.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.727
I had no idea
that people

10:34.760 --> 10:39.932
were capable of such
terrible things.

10:54.614 --> 10:56.083
<i>You.
Where were you, on break?</i>

10:56.116 --> 10:57.285
Here, here.

11:02.457 --> 11:04.258
<i>You see that?</i>

11:04.292 --> 11:05.293
<i>Other end of the room.</i>

11:06.796 --> 11:10.265
<i>It's Jimmy Sales
and his wife Jenna.</i>

11:10.299 --> 11:11.934
<i>How'd you pick these two?</i>

11:11.967 --> 11:13.268
<i>Seemed like
pretty shitty people</i>

11:13.302 --> 11:15.270
<i>who could do
with some humbling.</i>

11:15.304 --> 11:16.306
<i>Hmm.</i>

11:17.307 --> 11:19.442
<i>What about the asshole?
What does he do?</i>

11:19.476 --> 11:21.111
"What the hell?

11:21.144 --> 11:22.312
Is that it?"

11:23.646 --> 11:26.450
<i>He's, like,
a music producer or something.</i>

11:26.484 --> 11:29.620
Definitely an asshole.
What about the broad?

11:29.653 --> 11:30.822
<i>Actress. She's good.</i>

11:31.322 --> 11:33.958
Got a couple of credits,
but nothing big.

11:33.991 --> 11:37.295
Hmm. Sound easily enough.
What next?

11:37.329 --> 11:38.798
<i>When he goes
to the bathroom,</i>

11:38.831 --> 11:41.466
I'm gonna go
over there.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.971
Say that I recognize
her from something.

11:45.004 --> 11:48.474
Introduce myself
as a young successful agent

11:48.508 --> 11:51.310
<i>who'd like to, you know,
get her some meetings.</i>

11:51.344 --> 11:52.979
<i>Give her a call
by the end of the week</i>

11:53.012 --> 11:56.483
and take her for a
drink, and yeah,

11:56.517 --> 12:00.654
the rest should be pretty easy.
Theoretically.

12:00.687 --> 12:01.688
<i>Hmm.</i>

12:02.689 --> 12:03.991
That's some
cold-blooded shit.

12:04.024 --> 12:07.195
Then it's my turn.

12:26.717 --> 12:27.852
<i>What's your idea?</i>

12:27.885 --> 12:31.856
I was thinking, um...
maybe we could get

12:31.889 --> 12:33.224
out of town
for the weekend?

12:35.727 --> 12:37.028
I mean, yeah.

12:37.061 --> 12:39.731
I'm sure I can come up
with some kind of story.

12:40.565 --> 12:41.900
Make something
happen.

13:24.113 --> 13:25.248
This is nice.

13:25.281 --> 13:26.282
You like it?

14:29.319 --> 14:31.789
Hey, baby.

14:31.822 --> 14:33.656
Did you miss me?

14:34.657 --> 14:35.658
Come...

14:36.994 --> 14:39.965
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

14:42.499 --> 14:46.303
Shh! Shh shh shh.
Shh shh shh.

14:46.337 --> 14:47.472
Fuck off!

14:54.013 --> 14:56.648
<i>Hello? Rebecca?</i>

14:56.681 --> 14:58.317
This isn't your wife.

14:58.351 --> 15:00.988
<i>Well, who the hell
is this?</i>

15:01.021 --> 15:02.823
Look, man,
you don't know who I am,

15:02.856 --> 15:05.826
but I've been having
an affair with your wife.

15:05.859 --> 15:06.828
<i>Something's happened
to her,</i>

15:06.861 --> 15:08.863
<i>and there was a note
on the table.</i>

15:24.712 --> 15:26.682
How long
does that last?

15:26.715 --> 15:28.350
The amount
I gave her?

15:28.384 --> 15:31.021
She's gonna be out
a couple more hours.

15:31.054 --> 15:32.521
Is she gonna be
all right?

15:32.554 --> 15:35.358
Yeah, man.
You all right?

15:35.392 --> 15:37.394
Getting second
thoughts or some shit?

15:38.729 --> 15:40.530
Are there
any side effects?

15:40.563 --> 15:43.533
Vomiting
or whatever.

15:43.566 --> 15:44.870
She'll be all new
by the time

15:44.903 --> 15:47.405
she head back to
Brentwood for pilates.

15:49.908 --> 15:53.544
It's the ransom note.
You talk to the husband?

15:53.577 --> 15:55.882
Yeah, man,
he's on his way.

15:55.915 --> 15:58.383
Sounded scared
shitless.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.385
He's got
the money, though.

16:00.419 --> 16:03.923
Well, there it is.
Time to get paid, lover boy.

16:10.430 --> 16:11.765
What the hell
is that for?

16:13.100 --> 16:14.268
Just in case.

16:16.437 --> 16:17.404
You're not starting
to actually feel

16:17.438 --> 16:19.573
for these
bitches, are you?

16:19.606 --> 16:20.909
Just don't do
anything stupid.

16:20.942 --> 16:23.278
Let's get the money
and get back to L.A.

16:57.816 --> 16:58.817
Hey, man.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.285
<i>Did you bring
the money?</i>

17:01.319 --> 17:02.654
Yeah, I got
the money.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.827
Who the hell would do
something like this to me?

17:09.162 --> 17:10.797
Where's
the note?

17:10.830 --> 17:12.332
The ransom note,
where is it?

17:28.850 --> 17:30.352
- James?
- Yeah.

17:34.356 --> 17:35.992
Yeah, I... you want
to come inside,

17:36.025 --> 17:38.493
and I'll show you
where I found the note?

17:38.527 --> 17:39.494
You got
the money?

17:39.528 --> 17:42.498
Yeah, in hundreds
like you said.

17:42.532 --> 17:44.333
Where the fuck
is she?

17:44.367 --> 17:46.170
- What the fuck has been going on?
- I...

17:46.203 --> 17:47.204
I don't know.
I don't know.

17:47.237 --> 17:50.374
I just...
If we just follow the instructions.

18:24.078 --> 18:25.079
Hey.

18:26.747 --> 18:29.417
I could only come
up with most of it.

18:31.253 --> 18:32.386
Okay?

18:32.420 --> 18:35.389
No, no,
you hang on to that for now.

18:35.423 --> 18:36.390
Do you want
to come inside?

18:36.424 --> 18:39.095
I'll show you where
I found the note.

18:44.100 --> 18:46.769
This is our daughter's
college education.

19:09.095 --> 19:12.098
- Where'd you find this?
- Right there.

19:14.599 --> 19:17.403
And how long have
you known my wife?

19:17.436 --> 19:20.774
Um, just about
two months.

19:24.945 --> 19:29.083
Look, um,
I've only got about $4,500

19:29.117 --> 19:31.753
in my
bank account.

19:31.786 --> 19:33.453
Yeah, I'll take
care of it.

19:42.965 --> 19:44.266
Which car
are we taking?

19:44.300 --> 19:45.769
We're not going to
take the Porsche.

19:45.802 --> 19:46.970
Take
the Beamer.

20:02.820 --> 20:04.790
You remember where
they said to go?

20:04.823 --> 20:05.824
Yeah.

20:46.202 --> 20:47.870
Yeah.

20:49.038 --> 20:50.373
Goddamn!

20:51.539 --> 20:53.343
<i>Your husband
must really love you</i>

20:53.377 --> 20:55.711
<i>to get you that big
fucking rock.</i>

21:12.563 --> 21:13.731
What the...

21:16.734 --> 21:17.735
What the...

22:14.466 --> 22:17.969
Please, open the door!
Are you there?

22:19.138 --> 22:20.139
<i>Are you there?</i>

22:26.979 --> 22:28.482
Please!

22:50.005 --> 22:51.974
He was
very handsome,

22:52.007 --> 22:56.645
very sweet,
very charming.

22:56.678 --> 22:58.181
I thought
we were in love.

22:59.849 --> 23:01.351
What a piece
of shit.

23:05.687 --> 23:07.825
<i>I just feel sorry
for the next poor girl.</i>

24:44.098 --> 24:45.566
Yeah.

24:45.599 --> 24:50.738
Drinks on you?

24:53.275 --> 24:55.577
Congratulations,
motherfucker.

24:55.610 --> 24:56.578
Hey, we're on our way
to having a couple

24:56.611 --> 24:58.446
of trophy wives
ourselves.

25:01.617 --> 25:04.620
- Question.
- You may proceed.

25:08.457 --> 25:10.927
When the girls
are in the van...

25:10.961 --> 25:11.962
Yeah?

25:13.630 --> 25:18.435
...I don't know, do you...
do anything to do them

25:18.468 --> 25:20.471
beyond what
we talk about?

25:21.973 --> 25:24.475
What you mean?
Like, do I rape them?

25:25.810 --> 25:27.812
Well, yeah.

25:28.980 --> 25:30.482
The third one,
I did.

25:38.991 --> 25:40.460
Hey, man, I'm just
fucking with you, dawg.

25:40.493 --> 25:41.461
Come on, man.

25:41.494 --> 25:42.962
It's not funny, man.

25:42.996 --> 25:46.166
<i>Man, look...
you find that next one yet?</i>

25:53.874 --> 25:55.509
I'm not doing it
anymore, man.

25:58.179 --> 25:59.181
The fuck you mean?

25:59.848 --> 26:02.651
I'm done.
It's wrong, man.

26:02.684 --> 26:04.152
We've been pushing
our luck far enough.

26:04.186 --> 26:07.155
We should...
we should just quit while we're ahead.

26:07.189 --> 26:09.659
And then do what?
What you wanna do?

26:09.692 --> 26:11.661
You want to do
a different kind of job?

26:11.694 --> 26:13.162
<i>I don't know,
I just don't want</i>

26:13.196 --> 26:15.833
<i>to terrorize these
people anymore.</i>

26:15.865 --> 26:17.836
Look, you said it
yourself, man.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.169
These motherfuckers
deserve it.

26:19.203 --> 26:20.839
<i>I don't know.</i>

26:20.871 --> 26:23.006
<i>You said that.</i>

26:23.040 --> 26:25.175
<i>All right,
look, one more.</i>

26:25.209 --> 26:27.177
<i>We do one more,
and then you can go back</i>

26:27.211 --> 26:28.680
<i>to whatever
it is the fuck</i>

26:28.713 --> 26:30.014
<i>you was doing
before this shit.</i>

26:30.048 --> 26:32.217
Man, we can be set
for years, man.

26:34.719 --> 26:36.187
Come on, now.

26:36.221 --> 26:41.026
Don't you ever, you know, think that
all this might come back around?

26:41.060 --> 26:44.697
Consequences are for
motherfuckers that get caught.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.566
We not getting caught.

26:46.900 --> 26:51.371
But I... does your
conscious ever bother you?

26:51.405 --> 26:53.875
Morality is some
man-made bullshit.

26:53.907 --> 26:55.041
Shit's for suckers, man.

26:55.075 --> 26:57.378
<i>What the hell
do you believe in, then?</i>

26:57.412 --> 26:59.213
Survival of the fittest.

26:59.247 --> 27:01.884
They're having a good
goddamn time.

27:01.916 --> 27:03.751
Fuck, man,
you killing me with this shit.

27:04.085 --> 27:05.219
<i>Man, get that money
and go invest</i>

27:05.253 --> 27:07.089
<i>in some stocks
or something, man.</i>

27:08.590 --> 27:09.925
<i>And look at it
this way.</i>

27:11.760 --> 27:13.762
<i>Man, you won't even
have to owe me no more.</i>

27:16.766 --> 27:18.435
We'll be done.

27:19.436 --> 27:21.237
<i>Now, come on, now.</i>

27:21.271 --> 27:23.606
I gotta sit here and beg a
motherfucker to make some money?

27:27.111 --> 27:29.915
There you go.
Man the fuck up.

27:29.947 --> 27:31.081
There's a bathroom
back there

27:31.115 --> 27:33.284
if you wanna go fix
your dress or something.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.461
What
can I do for you?

27:43.128 --> 27:45.933
Four rosés, soda,
and a lime, please.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.100
Four rosés.
Soda. Lime.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.602
Got you.
Be right back.

27:49.635 --> 27:51.103
Can I have one
of those as well?

27:51.137 --> 27:52.940
And a Grey Goose
as well, please?

27:52.972 --> 27:54.943
Four rosés. Soda.
Grey Goose.

27:54.975 --> 27:55.976
All right,
be right back.

28:03.150 --> 28:04.820
Can I help you
with something?

28:05.821 --> 28:08.456
Sorry, I didn't
mean to stare.

28:08.490 --> 28:11.159
My sweet? Please.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.805
Excuse me,
uh, who are they?

28:21.838 --> 28:22.840
<i>That's Frank Emerson.</i>

28:24.674 --> 28:26.142
Who's Frank Emerson?

28:26.176 --> 28:27.979
<i>Frank Emerson,
the big tech guy.</i>

28:28.011 --> 28:29.346
<i>They come here
all the time.</i>

28:29.847 --> 28:31.314
<i>Know her name?</i>

28:31.348 --> 28:34.151
Uh, Rebecca?
Becky? Bridget?

28:34.185 --> 28:35.821
<i>I don't know,
one of those White girl names.</i>

28:35.854 --> 28:38.656
Cool. Thanks, man.

28:38.689 --> 28:39.690
<i>Oh, yeah, no problem.</i>

28:47.199 --> 28:49.869
Last burner.
Number's on the back.

28:52.705 --> 28:56.010
Cool. I think
Rebecca's the one.

28:56.042 --> 28:57.043
<i>The one?</i>

28:58.211 --> 28:59.212
The <i>last</i> one.

29:01.048 --> 29:02.349
<i>Fuck Rebecca, man.</i>

29:02.383 --> 29:05.519
This Frank Emerson,
you say he's a big tech guy or whatever?

29:05.553 --> 29:07.856
Ain't this the type of shit
we've been waiting on?

29:07.889 --> 29:09.858
<i>It's about time we double
down on this ransom.</i>

29:09.891 --> 29:12.727
Yeah, just let me worry about Mrs.
Emerson first.

29:13.896 --> 29:15.697
<i>Do your thing,
playboy.</i>

29:15.730 --> 29:16.899
<i>Do your thing.</i>

29:19.902 --> 29:21.704
Oh, you know what,
he didn't bring me valet, either.

29:21.737 --> 29:22.873
I'm gonna hit that
and get that.

29:22.906 --> 29:24.073
Okay.

29:32.549 --> 29:33.885
Excuse me?

29:35.218 --> 29:39.524
You've been
staring. Again.

29:39.557 --> 29:41.192
- You don't like it?
- No, I don't.

29:41.225 --> 29:42.861
It's actually making me
really uncomfortable.

29:42.895 --> 29:44.228
- May I?
- No.

29:44.562 --> 29:46.031
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

29:46.065 --> 29:47.699
I'll go crazy

29:47.732 --> 29:48.700
if I don't
see you again.

29:48.733 --> 29:50.369
You already
are crazy.

29:50.402 --> 29:52.404
My husband's coming
back any second.

29:52.738 --> 29:54.040
- Come on, seriously...
- Look, look, look.

29:54.074 --> 29:57.209
If you just give me your
number, I'll leave.

29:57.242 --> 29:58.411
I don't even
know you.

29:59.412 --> 30:01.882
Joseph. Joe.

30:01.916 --> 30:04.384
Well, you have a lot of
nerve, Joseph.

30:04.417 --> 30:05.719
I'm married.

30:05.752 --> 30:08.255
<i>I know,
and you're also very beautiful.</i>

30:09.590 --> 30:10.591
Boy.

30:11.927 --> 30:13.728
I bet you
say that a lot.

30:13.761 --> 30:16.397
You're not half as charming
as you think you are, Joseph.

30:16.430 --> 30:17.565
I'm gonna give you
my number,

30:17.599 --> 30:19.068
and if you change your
mind, you can call me.

30:19.102 --> 30:20.903
If not, that's fine.

30:20.937 --> 30:22.237
Okay, fine,
just hand it over.

30:22.270 --> 30:24.773
Give it to me and leave.

30:25.774 --> 30:26.775
You gonna call me?

30:28.946 --> 30:30.080
- I'm not gonna call you.
- That's fine.

30:30.114 --> 30:34.084
Just take... just take it.
It's lovely meeting you.

30:34.118 --> 30:36.619
- Bye.
- Have a good night.

30:43.460 --> 30:44.595
<i>All right, I'm good.</i>

30:44.628 --> 30:45.763
Yeah.

30:45.796 --> 30:47.766
<i>Patrick, it sounds like
you're in there.</i>

30:47.799 --> 30:48.800
Maybe.

30:49.467 --> 30:50.435
Definitely
a tough one.

30:50.468 --> 30:52.270
Now, that's
for sure.

30:52.303 --> 30:54.272
You sound like
a fucking schoolgirl.

30:54.305 --> 30:55.440
What, you like her
or something?

30:55.473 --> 30:57.476
What? No.

30:59.146 --> 31:01.948
Well, it sounds
like you like her.

31:01.982 --> 31:03.783
Oh, unknown number, man.
This could be her.

31:03.816 --> 31:06.453
- Shh shh shh.
- Hey, don't fuck it up, man.

31:06.486 --> 31:08.455
We asking for more
money this time.

31:08.488 --> 31:09.456
<i>Not many men would have</i>

31:09.489 --> 31:12.126
the balls to come up
to me in public.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.962
Let alone demand
my phone number

31:14.996 --> 31:17.132
while my husband
is in the bathroom.

31:17.166 --> 31:20.468
It... it was effective.

31:20.501 --> 31:22.137
What does
your husband do?

31:22.171 --> 31:23.337
Frank?

31:24.338 --> 31:27.844
- Why?
- I'm just curious.

31:29.012 --> 31:33.149
Frank is...
well, he makes a lot of money.

31:33.183 --> 31:37.821
He's smart and
extremely private.

31:37.855 --> 31:41.491
- Mm-hmm.
- And he has gone to considerable lengths

31:41.524 --> 31:43.326
to keep it
that way.

31:43.359 --> 31:48.166
So very wealthy man who
doesn't like attention.

31:48.200 --> 31:51.335
That's very
un-L.A. of him.

31:51.368 --> 31:52.503
Yeah, that's not
the only thing

31:52.536 --> 31:54.207
he doesn't want
these days.

31:57.043 --> 32:00.545
Let's not talk about
your husband anymore.

32:03.382 --> 32:04.550
What?

32:06.220 --> 32:11.357
Well... I was thinking, um...
would you want

32:11.390 --> 32:13.027
to maybe
get out of town

32:13.061 --> 32:15.029
or something
for a few days?

32:15.063 --> 32:16.396
And go
where?

32:18.900 --> 32:22.370
Have you ever
been to Big Bear?

32:22.403 --> 32:25.040
And what would
we do there?

32:25.074 --> 32:27.910
We could do
whatever you want.

32:30.079 --> 32:33.250
Okay. Let's go
to Big Bear.

32:49.432 --> 32:51.435
I think your ass
in love or something.

32:53.437 --> 32:54.405
What are you talking about, man?

32:54.438 --> 32:56.774
I'm gonna rob her.
I want to.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.945
Then what the fuck
taking so long?

33:01.281 --> 33:02.447
I'm almost there.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.287
Shit,
I can't tell.

33:10.123 --> 33:12.927
With the last
couple ones,

33:12.960 --> 33:14.460
they've been getting
pretty rough.

33:15.963 --> 33:18.933
Yeah, I know.
And what about it?

33:18.966 --> 33:20.101
I'm not running
a fucking day care.

33:20.135 --> 33:22.103
This ain't
no hospice.

33:22.137 --> 33:23.437
We're fucking
kidnapping them.

33:23.470 --> 33:25.439
No, I'm just
saying...

33:25.472 --> 33:27.943
that Rebecca's
finally agreed to go

33:27.976 --> 33:30.612
to Big Bear with me,
so if you just don't mind

33:30.645 --> 33:31.613
taking it easy
on her

33:31.646 --> 33:33.615
when she's
in your... possession.

33:33.648 --> 33:36.118
How about this,
you drug and kidnap her?

33:36.152 --> 33:37.786
Clean up the piss, the vomit.

33:37.819 --> 33:40.123
Sit in the goddamn
van all day...

33:40.157 --> 33:41.791
while I go do
the fucking,

33:41.824 --> 33:43.961
the cuddling,
and the laying up.

33:43.994 --> 33:44.995
Huh?

33:46.330 --> 33:47.496
How about it?

33:53.670 --> 33:56.807
If you wanna call this one
off, man, I'm down.

33:56.841 --> 33:58.643
Oh, no,
no, no.

33:58.676 --> 34:01.512
Definitely not calling this one off.
Mm-mm.

36:04.950 --> 36:06.284
<i>Whatever happens...</i>

36:10.122 --> 36:15.261
<i>I just... I want to be with
you, and I'll give up</i>

36:15.294 --> 36:17.463
<i>the things I have here
and everything.</i>

36:20.632 --> 36:22.302
<i>What do you
mean, "Whatever happens"?</i>

36:23.971 --> 36:25.973
<i>Uncharted waters, I guess.</i>

38:37.118 --> 38:38.586
<i>Hey, sweetheart,
where are you?</i>

38:38.619 --> 38:42.924
Uh, this isn't
your wife.

38:42.957 --> 38:44.758
<i>Who the hell is this?</i>

38:44.791 --> 38:47.129
<i>Look,
Rebecca and I been having an affair.</i>

38:49.298 --> 38:50.933
<i>I swear to God,
I am going to kill you!</i>

38:50.966 --> 38:53.435
We left L.A.
a day ago.

38:53.468 --> 38:55.270
<i>I woke up this morning.
I went for a run.</i>

38:55.304 --> 38:58.141
<i>I just got back,
and she's not here.</i>

38:59.142 --> 39:00.109
And there was
a note.

39:01.644 --> 39:03.779
"$50,000 in cash
or she dies.

39:03.812 --> 39:06.150
Tell no one,
or she dies."

39:06.483 --> 39:07.585
<i>It's got an address.</i>

39:07.618 --> 39:10.287
<i>It says, "Bring money
and her phone. 7:00 a.m."</i>

39:13.823 --> 39:15.126
<i>Text me the address.</i>

39:15.160 --> 39:16.127
<i>You stay right there.</i>

39:16.161 --> 39:17.828
<i>I'm gonna be there
in five hours.</i>

39:32.011 --> 39:33.012
Where's this note?

40:13.024 --> 40:18.162
You know...
my wife's cheating on me with you,

40:18.195 --> 40:20.698
and I'm sitting here
sharing a bottle with you.

40:23.035 --> 40:26.338
Make no sense.

40:26.371 --> 40:30.509
<i>Look, we need to talk about
what we're gonna do tomorrow.</i>

40:30.542 --> 40:31.711
Mmm.

40:37.216 --> 40:39.385
Oh, shi... Ow!

40:49.229 --> 40:52.233
Hey, you know,
I wonder if that woman ever loved me.

40:52.567 --> 40:56.237
<i>You know she's gonna leave you, too, right?</i>

40:56.738 --> 40:59.407
She's just a manipulative
bitch, anyway.

41:04.747 --> 41:06.549
You don't know
that yet.

41:06.582 --> 41:09.585
You ain't learned that
yet, but I have.

41:11.588 --> 41:12.556
Oh, hell,
it don't matter.

41:12.589 --> 41:14.925
We all end up
alone, anyway.

41:43.456 --> 41:45.792
You know, we forgot
to go to the bank.

41:47.127 --> 41:48.295
The money's
in the back.

42:53.867 --> 42:56.003
What do we
do now?

42:56.037 --> 42:57.538
Just relax.

43:01.709 --> 43:03.211
Okay, here.

43:24.568 --> 43:25.569
Whoa.

43:30.407 --> 43:32.710
<i>Take the keys
out of the ignition</i>

43:32.743 --> 43:35.380
<i>and throw them
out the window.</i>

43:35.413 --> 43:37.716
Yeah, no, we want
to see her first.

43:37.749 --> 43:38.750
<i>No.</i>

43:40.585 --> 43:42.087
Put the fucking
blindfold on!

43:45.926 --> 43:46.927
<i>Keys.</i>

43:52.598 --> 43:55.435
Here, tie this around your waist.
Tight.

43:58.605 --> 44:01.275
- <i>Do you have the money?</i>
- Yes.

44:13.289 --> 44:15.424
Wait up.
What are you doing?

44:15.457 --> 44:16.927
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

44:16.960 --> 44:20.429
What the... Look, just...
I'll go.

44:20.462 --> 44:22.432
You just don't
do anything stupid.

44:22.465 --> 44:24.601
Yeah, well,
that's the least you can do.

44:24.634 --> 44:26.636
- <i>Now!</i>
- Pop the trunk, would you?

44:50.329 --> 44:51.631
- What's happening?
- <i>That's it.</i>

44:51.664 --> 44:53.333
Keep going.
Keep walking to me.

44:54.667 --> 44:56.469
That's it.
I'm here.

44:56.502 --> 44:57.670
Just follow
my voice.

45:00.174 --> 45:01.175
<i>That's it.</i>

45:01.675 --> 45:02.978
Keep walking.
Go to your husband.

45:03.011 --> 45:05.679
10 more feet.
10 more feet.

45:14.189 --> 45:16.491
I'll shoot her.
Get the fucking money!

45:16.524 --> 45:19.028
This way.
Go, go.

45:25.668 --> 45:27.470
Frank!
Frank!

45:27.503 --> 45:28.471
Frank!

45:28.504 --> 45:29.840
<i>Frank, help!</i>

45:31.508 --> 45:32.509
Frank,
help!

45:33.343 --> 45:35.512
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

46:45.757 --> 46:48.560
<i>When you think
that you know someone.</i>

46:48.593 --> 46:51.396
I mean, really know
someone that you want

46:51.429 --> 46:54.066
to be with,
and you find out

46:54.100 --> 46:56.769
they've been lying to
you the whole time...

46:58.437 --> 47:00.073
I don't know what
to say about him.

47:00.107 --> 47:01.741
I don't know where
he could be.

47:01.774 --> 47:03.743
Why don't you tell me
something about him?

47:03.776 --> 47:05.412
Why can't you
find him?

47:05.445 --> 47:07.781
Is there anything
else you can tell me?

47:08.950 --> 47:10.584
It felt so real
at the time.

47:10.617 --> 47:15.289
He had really convinced
me that we were in love.

47:18.793 --> 47:21.763
I had no idea that
people were capable

47:21.796 --> 47:26.936
of such
terrible things.

47:27.971 --> 47:29.973
<i>I'll describe him
for you as best I can.</i>

47:32.976 --> 47:34.644
The gun, the van...

47:39.482 --> 47:42.953
The most of the time,
he was wearing a mask.

47:42.987 --> 47:45.123
He was a black guy.

47:45.157 --> 47:48.160
And I was most of
the time blindfolded.

47:50.162 --> 47:52.664
How do people even
become such animals?

47:54.000 --> 47:55.834
He even took
my wedding ring.

47:59.005 --> 48:01.840
I just feel sorry
for the next poor girl.

48:04.844 --> 48:07.147
Can you tell us anything?
Anything at all?

48:07.181 --> 48:08.481
A name?

48:08.514 --> 48:10.516
I told you everything
that I know.

48:11.684 --> 48:14.189
I don't want to keep
reliving this anymore.

48:15.355 --> 48:17.825
I just want you
to find them.

48:17.858 --> 48:20.360
I know,
and we will.

48:22.864 --> 48:24.499
Look, thank you
for coming in.

48:24.532 --> 48:27.002
Okay, it really does help.
A lot.

48:27.036 --> 48:29.370
<i>All four victims have one
major thing in common.</i>

48:30.039 --> 48:31.507
It's the same lover.

48:31.540 --> 48:32.842
This guy takes each
and every one of them

48:32.875 --> 48:33.843
on these
romantic getaways

48:33.876 --> 48:35.344
where they're
kidnapped, right?

48:35.377 --> 48:38.014
He contacts their
husband for the ransom.

48:38.048 --> 48:40.516
Ransom note says if you
contact the police, she's dead.

48:40.549 --> 48:41.852
Look at this.

48:41.885 --> 48:45.355
Three separate sketches from
three different victims.

48:45.388 --> 48:49.693
Sierra Nevada, San Simeon,
Ojai, Palm Desert.

48:49.726 --> 48:51.562
It's the same guy.

48:53.065 --> 48:54.398
Find a match.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.406
You find
this creep yet?

49:02.908 --> 49:04.077
Not yet.

49:18.259 --> 49:20.728
The only way to
draw these guys out

49:20.761 --> 49:22.930
is to set them up
by going undercover.

49:24.765 --> 49:26.901
Elaborate, Detective.

49:26.935 --> 49:28.904
Well, we become
their next marks.

49:28.938 --> 49:30.906
Dress up
in the fancy clothes.

49:30.940 --> 49:32.908
<i>We got
the rich husband, Frank.</i>

49:32.942 --> 49:34.910
<i>We make them believe
that their conning us.</i>

49:34.944 --> 49:36.745
<i>Get them vulnerable,
you know?</i>

49:36.778 --> 49:37.913
<i>Make them believe
in the illusion,</i>

49:37.947 --> 49:40.250
<i>and then when the time
is right, we move in.</i>

49:40.284 --> 49:43.586
All the victims met this
guy at high-end restaurants.

49:43.619 --> 49:46.089
Mostly Brentwood,
Beverly Hills.

49:46.123 --> 49:47.758
We target this guy
when he's on the prowl

49:47.791 --> 49:50.594
for his next victim,
and that's when we assume

49:50.627 --> 49:52.629
our roles as rich
husband and wife.

49:56.968 --> 49:58.270
And tell me why
we shouldn't just save

49:58.304 --> 49:59.604
the department
time and money

49:59.637 --> 50:01.307
and take this guy
down now?

50:02.640 --> 50:04.109
These guys
are too smart, sir.

50:04.143 --> 50:05.610
We <i>hav</i> to catch
them in the act.

50:05.643 --> 50:06.611
Both of them.

50:06.644 --> 50:07.613
I mean, the guy in the van

50:07.646 --> 50:08.614
who's drugging
these women,

50:08.647 --> 50:09.615
we <i>have</i>
to get him.

50:09.648 --> 50:11.650
You know, sir,
I do agree with that.

50:15.989 --> 50:17.624
Go on.

50:17.657 --> 50:20.460
The crimes are happening
outside of the county.

50:20.493 --> 50:22.129
I mean, technically,
if we bust them,

50:22.163 --> 50:23.797
we have to catch them
in the act, right?

50:23.830 --> 50:28.337
- But more importantly...
- Get them within our county so we can make the arrest.

50:35.177 --> 50:37.146
You're sure
about this?

50:37.180 --> 50:38.982
Yes, sir.

50:39.015 --> 50:40.350
And you're all right with
this, Frank?

50:42.651 --> 50:43.987
Yes, sir.

50:45.154 --> 50:47.291
Well, then,
get on it before the Feds get wind.

50:47.324 --> 50:49.625
I don't want them
taking credit for this.

50:49.659 --> 50:52.463
- Yes, sir.
- Hold on.

50:52.495 --> 50:55.467
Tell me more about
this Shead guy.

50:55.499 --> 50:56.800
Well,
Patrick Shead.

50:56.834 --> 51:00.138
He, uh,
his father relocated the family

51:00.171 --> 51:01.638
to the States when
he got a new job,

51:01.672 --> 51:03.308
but shortly after
that, he made some

51:03.341 --> 51:05.643
bad investments,
went bankrupt.

51:05.677 --> 51:07.313
Mother leaves
his father

51:07.346 --> 51:10.983
for his business
partner, disappears.

51:11.017 --> 51:14.488
His father sinks into a deep
depression, alcoholism.

51:14.520 --> 51:19.658
<i>Suffers an untimely death, leaving
a young Patrick to fend for himself.</i>

51:19.692 --> 51:21.827
<i>18, he slides into a life</i>

51:21.861 --> 51:24.365
<i>of petty crime,
all nonviolent offenses.</i>

51:26.200 --> 51:28.835
<i>14 years and several
small convictions,</i>

51:28.869 --> 51:30.371
<i>he's sent to Lompoc.</i>

51:34.043 --> 51:35.843
<i>He spent about
two and a half years there.</i>

51:35.877 --> 51:37.845
<i>He just got released
on good behavior.</i>

51:37.879 --> 51:39.014
<i>He's teamed up
with what we think</i>

51:39.048 --> 51:40.681
<i>is a known associate,
and they've been</i>

51:40.715 --> 51:42.384
<i>pulling these cons
ever since.</i>

52:22.762 --> 52:23.930
What are
we doing, man?

52:28.435 --> 52:30.104
What the fuck
are you doing?

52:32.440 --> 52:35.110
You got too sloppy,
falling for the mark.

52:37.945 --> 52:39.114
Give me
the burner.

52:55.631 --> 52:57.300
Yeah, here.

52:59.302 --> 53:00.605
I'm taking
the rest.

53:00.637 --> 53:02.273
Now, get the fuck out.

53:02.306 --> 53:03.940
You serious?

53:03.975 --> 53:05.642
Is this your plan
all along?

53:07.145 --> 53:08.112
You did it
to yourself.

53:10.482 --> 53:12.451
You're really
doing this?

53:12.484 --> 53:13.818
Don't make me
say it again.

54:06.877 --> 54:08.379
That was good work, Detective.

54:10.215 --> 54:11.882
It's not over yet.

54:12.217 --> 54:14.552
Look, go home.
Get some sleep.

54:15.886 --> 54:17.056
No chance.

54:36.077 --> 54:37.578
<i>We have our proof.
Let's go make the arrest.</i>

54:38.079 --> 54:39.547
<i>Let us
know when they land.</i>

54:39.580 --> 54:41.549
- <i>I want to wrap this up.</i>
- Yes, sir.

54:45.087 --> 54:46.754
- Detective?
- It's him.

54:48.590 --> 54:50.726
Does he still
buy your cover?

54:50.791 --> 54:51.759
Yeah.

54:52.927 --> 54:54.096
Answer it.

54:58.268 --> 55:00.069
Joe, is that you?

55:00.103 --> 55:03.740
Rebecca...
there's a few things

55:03.772 --> 55:07.611
that I haven't really been
upfront with you about.

55:08.112 --> 55:11.914
<i>I really would prefer
to tell you in person.</i>

55:11.948 --> 55:13.751
<i>I'm at Union Station.</i>

55:13.783 --> 55:16.588
<i>I'm going to go to a motel
near the airport tomorrow,</i>

55:16.621 --> 55:18.256
<i>and I'll give you
a call then.</i>

55:18.290 --> 55:20.592
I look forward
to seeing you.

55:20.625 --> 55:22.093
Bye.

55:22.127 --> 55:23.128
<i>Joe...</i>

55:28.634 --> 55:29.968
Everything
okay?

55:31.637 --> 55:33.273
He's at
Union Station.

55:33.307 --> 55:34.940
He leaves
tomorrow, LAX.

55:34.975 --> 55:37.943
Whoa, GPS just landed
at the Toy District.

55:37.978 --> 55:39.780
How accurate
is that?

55:39.812 --> 55:42.617
- Accurate.
- Patrick's... Shead's lying.

55:42.650 --> 55:44.118
He's just trying
to throw us off.

55:44.152 --> 55:45.787
Hold up.

55:45.819 --> 55:47.155
You're gonna stay
here on this one.

55:47.821 --> 55:49.956
Get some rest.

55:49.991 --> 55:51.159
Saddle up.

55:54.496 --> 55:55.830
Take it easy.

57:08.210 --> 57:11.515
Hey, excuse me, sir?
Just a minute.

57:11.548 --> 57:12.883
I need
to talk to you.

57:13.717 --> 57:16.019
Sir?
Hey, stop!

57:16.052 --> 57:17.554
Stop, LAPD!

57:17.888 --> 57:19.056
Stop!

57:32.905 --> 57:34.239
Freeze!

57:38.745 --> 57:39.913
<i>Freeze!</i>

57:41.080 --> 57:43.583
<i>Hey! Freeze!</i>

58:42.815 --> 58:44.817
Freeze, mother fucker!

59:04.006 --> 59:05.807
- Freeze!
- Drop it!

59:05.841 --> 59:06.842
Freeze!

59:08.343 --> 59:10.679
Drop it! Drop it!

59:41.546 --> 59:43.182
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

59:43.215 --> 59:46.385
I'm at the Buena Vista Hotel
near the airport.

59:47.219 --> 59:48.220
Yeah.

59:49.221 --> 59:51.891
Room 406.

59:54.561 --> 59:56.530
Okay, see you soon.

59:56.563 --> 59:57.564
Good morning.

1:00:04.739 --> 1:00:05.907
Was that him?

1:00:53.292 --> 1:00:55.261
<i>I know you're heavily
invested in this case, but...</i>

1:00:55.294 --> 1:00:57.597
I'm fine.

1:00:57.630 --> 1:00:59.134
Let's just
get this done.

1:01:01.802 --> 1:01:05.140
1-26. All units
proceed with caution.

1:01:36.807 --> 1:01:37.809
<i>Patrick?</i>

1:01:45.817 --> 1:01:47.319
Hello? Patrick?

1:01:52.825 --> 1:01:54.326
Are you there?
It's me.

1:01:57.164 --> 1:01:58.331
Hello?

1:02:07.341 --> 1:02:08.843
What the fuck?

1:02:26.362 --> 1:02:27.497
<i>All clear!</i>

1:02:27.530 --> 1:02:28.664
<i>Check under.</i>

1:02:31.201 --> 1:02:32.869
<i>We're all clear.
Dinner's gone out.</i>

1:03:34.437 --> 1:03:36.606
10-26.
The room's empty.

1:03:39.109 --> 1:03:40.077
Are you sure
he gave you

1:03:40.110 --> 1:03:41.611
the right
room number?

1:03:43.614 --> 1:03:45.116
He can't
run forever.

1:04:17.818 --> 1:04:20.822
<i>I'm sorry that
we only got the one.</i>

1:04:21.323 --> 1:04:24.459
Well, you did some really
good work here, Rebecca.

1:04:24.492 --> 1:04:26.461
I'm gonna recommend
you for a promotion,

1:04:26.494 --> 1:04:29.131
and I'm gonna make
sure that you get it.

1:04:29.164 --> 1:04:30.666
Thank you, sir.

1:04:31.667 --> 1:04:34.337
Now, we're officially turning
this case over to the Bureau.

1:04:36.339 --> 1:04:38.007
So you can go home.

1:04:38.507 --> 1:04:40.344
Spend some time
with your family.

1:07:21.488 --> 1:07:25.625
Could I take you
to, um,

1:07:25.659 --> 1:07:28.463
another special place
when we get back?

1:07:28.496 --> 1:07:30.298
Another time?

1:07:30.331 --> 1:07:31.998
What's wrong
with this place?

1:07:33.335 --> 1:07:35.137
Nothing.

1:07:35.170 --> 1:07:36.305
There's nothing wrong
with this place,

1:07:36.338 --> 1:07:40.842
<i>just, um...
it's like a little resort.</i>

1:07:52.356 --> 1:07:54.525
You're moving
really fast for me.

1:07:56.693 --> 1:07:58.027
That's not a no.

1:08:01.533 --> 1:08:03.201
It does
sound nice.

1:08:07.872 --> 1:08:11.177
I know I am moving
very quickly,

1:08:11.210 --> 1:08:14.679
but I don't know,
I just never felt this way

1:08:14.713 --> 1:08:20.387
about anyone before, and...
I really do like you.

1:08:33.401 --> 1:08:35.403
Yes, I'll go.

1:08:36.737 --> 1:08:38.072
You will?

1:10:15.012 --> 1:10:15.980
<i>You really believe</i>

1:10:16.014 --> 1:10:17.982
<i>we can just switch out
our lives?</i>

1:10:18.016 --> 1:10:19.485
<i>The decisions
we've already made</i>

1:10:19.518 --> 1:10:20.852
<i>this late in the game?</i>

1:10:23.355 --> 1:10:25.358
<i>I mean, you really think
we can change?</i>

1:10:28.361 --> 1:10:30.863
<i>We certainly can't have it
both ways.</i>

1:19:56.087 --> 1:19:57.256
Patrick.
