WEBVTT

00:28.028 --> 00:31.907
Oh, my God, I just,
I just don't think I can go on.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.325
Patricia, listen to my voice.

00:34.701 --> 00:35.702
I'm here for you.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.581
Now, let's just breathe
and weigh our options.

00:40.874 --> 00:44.628
What difference would options make?
After 20 years, he left me.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.047
Twenty long years, bastard.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.800
We've talked about him already, okay?

00:49.883 --> 00:52.386
He hurt you, he tore your heart out,
and Patricia,

00:52.469 --> 00:56.056
that thing with the border collie,
damn it, Patricia, I was in tears for you.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.851
But what do we really know?

00:59.560 --> 01:03.063
We know that it's okay to hurt sometimes.

01:03.146 --> 01:08.318
We also know that he's making
no more decisions for you.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.612
I made up my mind, I'm hanging up.

01:10.696 --> 01:12.865
Patricia, you wait.
You don't hang up that phone.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.616
Patricia, just stay with me.

01:15.868 --> 01:16.702
Please.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.662
Please.

01:22.958 --> 01:25.252
-Patricia?
-I'm still here.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.296
Okay, that's good.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.090
Patricia, that's real good, okay?

01:30.174 --> 01:31.550
I'm already seeing some growth.

01:32.885 --> 01:37.347
Now here's the thing, Patricia.
I'm offering help, if you want it.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.516
Because we all need help sometimes.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.729
You know what, fuck it.
Give me the full package.

01:43.812 --> 01:47.441
Platinum Triple Play, HBO,
Starz, phone, Internet, all of it.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.198
I am so proud of you.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.575
You've already shown so much growth.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.453
I'm gonna go ahead,
I'll put those numbers in.

01:59.536 --> 02:02.164
-Great. Are you ready for my card number?
-Absolutely.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.075
We will be in touch.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.536
-Oh, well I really appreciate--
-All right now.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.456
That is what you call a first ballot
hall of fame performance.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.460
-Let's get another one, Big Fred.
-I understand, Ms. Wise.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.629
These times are hard on all of us.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.840
Internet and cable
are kind of expensive bills,

03:34.923 --> 03:36.383
-especially when you have--
-No.

03:36.466 --> 03:40.846
Like my mama say,
I shall keep you in my prayers, Mrs.--

03:40.929 --> 03:46.226
Mrs. Wise. And I pray that you recognise
your freely-given faith.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.937
And right here, right now,

03:49.021 --> 03:53.233
start living in a life of abundance,
and enjoying a life of prosperity.

03:53.317 --> 03:58.906
And the best way to exorcise that almighty
faith is to try my service today.

03:58.989 --> 03:59.823
God bless you.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.537
You like porn? We got porn.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.375
-What kind of porn we talking about?
-Oh, my corporate number, yeah.

04:10.459 --> 04:13.879
It's 1-800-FUCK-YOU.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.507
You want me to add you
to the do not call list?

04:16.589 --> 04:19.009
Shit. I mean, shit, I mean, please.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.719
I just don't think that's a good idea.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.723
Kasey. Thanks.

04:25.307 --> 04:28.101
But that lady might not be able
to afford our package.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.395
We should do no evil.

04:32.773 --> 04:38.779
Man, you know what? That is so crazy that
you think that I care, because I don't.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.365
After the sale, bro, it's out of my hands.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.824
Can't say I disagree there.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.537
Yeah, unless she wants
that private dick-stillation.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.705
-Bow, bow, bow--
-Get it, get it, get it.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.041
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.293
Yeah, I hurt myself a little bit.

04:54.211 --> 04:55.337
Her home's in foreclosure.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.799
That's unfortunate for her.

04:58.882 --> 05:02.261
You know, because what they're gonna do
is they're gonna remove her from her home

05:02.719 --> 05:06.807
and leave all that good entertainment
in the house for somebody else, you know?

05:08.016 --> 05:11.436
All right.
Last day of the sales period, shit-heads.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.523
Let's focus on the three
necessities of life.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.358
Phone, cable, Internet.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.776
It's just that simple.

05:19.570 --> 05:20.404
Nice work.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.283
But that Patricia lady, 22 minutes.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.993
You going soft on me, king?

05:26.076 --> 05:26.994
I got the sale.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.245
And her life story.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.123
And the sale. Listen, Liz,
your boys are running out of gas,

05:31.206 --> 05:32.332
it's embarrassing, really.

05:35.085 --> 05:38.505
May I remind you, 3 grand is at stake.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.425
Six hours until end of business.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.552
Still anyone's ballgame.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.512
All right, let's see where we're at.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.891
-Call them out.
-Almost had a triple.

05:49.892 --> 05:52.394
And I almost cared.
Who else besides Kasey?

05:53.478 --> 05:55.063
Double play. Cable and Internet.

05:55.898 --> 05:59.818
Yeah. I hate to be that guy,
but I closed that one, Liz,

05:59.902 --> 06:02.905
so go ahead and add that to mine,
plus two other triple plays.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.157
-Love it.
-Yeah, sorry rookie,

06:05.240 --> 06:06.450
it's the law of the land.

06:06.533 --> 06:10.829
Remember, winner not only takes
our largest commission to date,

06:10.913 --> 06:12.581
but also the throne chair.

06:13.165 --> 06:17.169
-And whoever ends up in last place...
-Justin.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.129
-Fuck off.
-Eat shit, asshole.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.507
That means you are the lowlife loser

06:21.590 --> 06:24.176
who will be given the shittiest sales list
you've ever seen.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.054
Hell, if it were legal,
I'd give you the worst list.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.722
The do not call list.

06:30.015 --> 06:34.478
And for anyone whose target asks
to be put on the do not call list,

06:35.187 --> 06:38.315
I'll subtract one of their miserable,
sorry ass sales.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.693
Now, has anyone asked
to be put on that list?

06:50.285 --> 06:52.871
Because I don't lie, okay? I never lie.

06:53.956 --> 06:56.458
I'm a good person, I visit my grandma.

06:56.542 --> 06:57.751
Shut up.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.559
Now everyone can
just shut their pie-holes,

07:13.642 --> 07:15.477
because I got a call
from corporate earlier.

07:16.061 --> 07:20.023
They're on their way here as we speak
for an all-hands-on-deck meeting.

07:20.107 --> 07:24.778
I have a very comfortable lead,
so I'm gonna take this as my cue to leave.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.865
The meeting's kind of a big deal,
got some suits flying in from Houston.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.741
Oh, Houston, lovely city,
love the Rockets.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.994
-Tell them I said what up.
-Kasey.

07:32.953 --> 07:33.954
I can't hear you.

07:46.175 --> 07:47.551
Ladies, ladies, please.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.637
No, don't get up,
I couldn't trouble you to do so.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.140
I was just on my lunch break
in the neighbourhood,

07:53.223 --> 07:58.478
and I thought to myself, huh,
who could use some roses?

07:58.979 --> 08:02.357
Oh, I know.
The ladies at the Wave Hair Salon.

08:02.441 --> 08:04.276
-Here you go.
-Is he crazy?

08:04.359 --> 08:05.319
-For you.
-Crazy.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.654
-Anyway, that's for you.
-Thank you.

08:07.738 --> 08:10.073
Yeah. Shelly, Shelly, Shelly.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.076
I'm just surprised it's not dripping
in snake oil.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.706
You'll kill these flowers.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.460
And one final rose
for a very special lady.

08:22.878 --> 08:29.343
Two years of emotional torture,
a single rose doesn't seem quite right.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.136
Well, I got two, technically.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.515
So it's one step closer
to getting you back.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.267
Look, is there any way
we can talk in private now?

08:37.351 --> 08:40.854
Just a minute, without inmate number one.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.232
Okay, Ms. Gordon?

08:43.315 --> 08:45.609
I'm gonna give him his minute,
or else he won't leave.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.861
Trust me, it's just better for everyone,
and I'll...

08:47.945 --> 08:49.530
Okay, I understand.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.699
But if you need some backup, just holler.

08:52.783 --> 08:56.954
Because baby, I don't mind taking off
the earrings to put some Vaseline on you.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.164
Don't have flashbacks
of your strip club days.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.124
-What?
-I love you.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.254
-I love you.
-I love you too, sugar.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.302
Honestly, I don't wanna be
the one to say it,

09:12.386 --> 09:16.056
but I don't think this
is the environment for you.

09:16.807 --> 09:20.519
Look, I'm almost done with my master's
in psych, and unlike you,

09:20.602 --> 09:22.437
I don't have a father footing the bill.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.190
In there is real life,

09:25.274 --> 09:27.192
and I've been waiting
for you to join me here.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.195
Like, in the salon?
Baby, I can't work here.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.489
-Don't be stupid.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

09:32.573 --> 09:35.450
But, you know,
I'm trying here, I really am.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.661
Do you want a cookie
for being a smooth talker?

09:37.744 --> 09:40.706
It depends on the type of cookie.
Okay, seriously.

09:40.789 --> 09:41.874
That was the last joke.

09:41.957 --> 09:44.209
But I'm serious, that's why I'm here.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.545
Okay? I want what you want,
I want what we want.

09:46.628 --> 09:52.426
You always say the right thing,
but I'm not your customer, okay?

09:52.509 --> 09:55.888
If you can't be open and honest
with me all of the time,

09:55.971 --> 09:57.306
then there is no "we."

09:57.389 --> 09:59.641
Hell, I haven't even met
all of your family yet.

09:59.725 --> 10:02.186
I keep saying,
you don't want to meet my dad.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.563
-I'm a family person.
-Hey, I am too.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.274
Very important to me,
and I'm being for real about that.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.567
Well then, prove it.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.736
And don't you dare try to sell me.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.154
Well, let me, okay.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.699
Let me just sell you one last time
on dinner tonight.

10:16.241 --> 10:21.288
All right, no hustles, no pickup lines,
just you, me, two fine steaks.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.458
We gave up red meat.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.295
We did, and I know, I remember.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.631
I didn't know if you had gone back
since the breakup,

10:30.714 --> 10:34.801
which is why I chose a place
with very fine aquatic selections.

10:35.344 --> 10:38.680
You know what I mean? Salmon, right?
God invented that. Leafy greens?

10:39.264 --> 10:42.476
Gotta have my fibre intake, you know,
because I stay backed up sometimes.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.854
-Stop.
-Really gotta keep it moving, you know?

10:50.192 --> 10:55.030
Look, there is this new French place
on 5th I've been wanting to try, so...

10:55.614 --> 10:58.659
Boom. I'm gonna leave right now
before you change your mind.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.369
-I can't hear.
-You can read my lips.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.412
-I can read your lips.
-What am I saying?

11:03.080 --> 11:04.831
-Salmon and sex?
-What time...

11:04.915 --> 11:07.209
-That's not what I said.
-That's what it sounds like.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.002
-Sex and salmon.
-Goodbye.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.212
And not in that order.

11:18.929 --> 11:22.641
Right, so, okay.

11:22.724 --> 11:27.646
Just to clarify, 8 p.m.,
a quiet table, with a view.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.107
Right. Thanks, Dana.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.901
Hey, let me ask you something.
I'm not doing too much, am I?

11:32.985 --> 11:35.487
You know, I mean,
there's a lot riding on this date.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.741
Oh, no, I trust your taste,
it was, you know...

11:39.825 --> 11:42.536
Right. All right, thanks, Dana.

11:52.087 --> 11:52.921
Showtime.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.220
-Fats, my man.
-Hey, Kasey.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.181
How's that Sunday Ticket treating you?

12:02.264 --> 12:04.141
Man, I ain't miss a game
all preseason, baby.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.560
Hey, call me when you want
that landline, all right?

12:07.227 --> 12:10.439
Cell phones for the bros, landlines...

12:11.481 --> 12:14.693
Is for the other bros, because we both
know you ain't getting no bitches.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.613
This is the only bitch I need, playa.

12:17.696 --> 12:18.739
My man.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.867
-Yes, I can! You're the shittiest...
-I ain't messing with that,

12:21.950 --> 12:22.993
that's all you.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.329
-That chick is a wild one.
-Oh, my God.

12:27.456 --> 12:28.290
That's good.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.292
You just have it out for me
because I'm short.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.294
-Oh, because you're short?
-Yeah.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.338
No, because you don't know how to sell.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.672
You are useless, go!

12:35.756 --> 12:38.675
-Can you get him out of here?
-You know what? You can suck my shit.

12:38.759 --> 12:42.346
I am gonna come back here
and bite everybody's dick off.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.890
Okay, go back to Jersey,
Justin, make your mama happy.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.225
Yeah, you come to New Jersey,

12:46.308 --> 12:47.726
-you see what we do to you.
-Okay.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.145
I'll bury you in the sand in the shore!

12:50.229 --> 12:52.105
Yup. You, my office.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.275
You know, Mrs. Hanks, what it is,

12:55.359 --> 12:58.237
Russia's gonna start tapping
all American cell phones very soon.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.239
-My Lord.
-Do yourself a favour

13:00.322 --> 13:04.243
and add our phone package today.
It's the only way to stay safe from Putin.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.411
I'm listening, but that's not me.

13:06.495 --> 13:10.207
I know it sounds like me,
but that's not me, you know.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.667
-No?
-A lot of people...

13:11.750 --> 13:15.420
Russian spyware, you know what I mean?
They can make you sound like anybody.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.589
You listen to Joe Rogan podcasts?

13:18.549 --> 13:19.800
-No.
-Oh, you'll see,

13:19.883 --> 13:21.635
maybe you should start, educate yourself.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.346
You know, before you bring
on these accusations.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.074
Sorry, Justin.

13:44.992 --> 13:48.662
We must show patriotism
by honouring a true American icon.

13:49.538 --> 13:53.041
I told a deception.
I shouldn't have told a deception.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.879
I know, and I've learned from it,
and I've grown, really.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.505
-I've grown from it. Yeah.
-You have?

13:58.589 --> 13:59.631
I've learned my lesson.

13:59.715 --> 14:01.717
-Today is a new day. For me.
-Okay.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.760
Any idea who that man might be?

14:03.844 --> 14:06.263
-Mr. Rogers?
-Not Rogers, ma'am.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.432
-James, Rick James.
-Rick James?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.100
That's right, Rick James.

14:10.184 --> 14:12.686
The one and only founding father
of "Super Freaks."

14:12.769 --> 14:14.605
-Super what?
-It sounds like I haven't grown

14:15.230 --> 14:16.356
when you play it back.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.026
-Yeah.
-Our wonderful Triple Play package.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.778
Someone will personally hand-deliver
a one of a kind

14:21.862 --> 14:24.198
Rick James wig right to your doorstep.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.743
Oh, my, that would be nice.
I bet my granddaughter would want one too.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.871
-Rick James.
-Kinda funny.

14:31.622 --> 14:35.209
I'd been listening to some "Super Freak"
on the car ride.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.960
-Creative.
-Yeah.

14:37.044 --> 14:41.757
Already over 100,000 views,
and you've mentioned the company's name.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.053
Corporate fucking loved it.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.222
Wait, so they're not upset?

14:48.305 --> 14:51.767
Upset? They nearly jizzed
their double-pleated slacks

14:51.850 --> 14:54.561
at the social media exposure
and potential revenue.

14:54.645 --> 14:57.105
-And with you being top salesman.
-I am.

14:57.189 --> 15:01.068
They demanded that the entire floor adopts
the Kasey Method.

15:01.693 --> 15:02.903
The Kasey Method.

15:03.695 --> 15:04.696
Yeah.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.074
Check out the front row.

15:11.286 --> 15:14.873
Hi, yes, this is Barry calling you
from TeleWin.

15:17.000 --> 15:17.835
Yeah.

15:18.669 --> 15:23.006
Actually, you know, when my pastor was 20,
he cared what everybody thought about him.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.844
When he turned 40, he didn't care
what nobody thought about him.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.096
But when he turned 60,

15:29.179 --> 15:32.307
he realised nobody cared
what they thought about him.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.727
So, what I'm trying to say is,
ma'am, you shouldn't care,

15:35.811 --> 15:37.396
you should buy one of these packages.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.773
Yes, okay.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.989
I like my coffee like I like my men.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.533
I don't, because I like girls.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.494
And everybody around here knows it.
Why are you in my chair?

15:53.245 --> 15:55.205
I'm sorry,
I just thought you wouldn't mind--

15:55.289 --> 15:57.291
"Sorry, Kasey."
You thought I wouldn't mind?

15:57.374 --> 15:59.793
Is that bow tie cutting off
the circulation to your brain?

16:00.294 --> 16:02.838
I guess I just wanted to channel
the master, that's all.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.840
-But hey--
-Hey, hey, hey.

16:06.258 --> 16:07.801
It's not about the chair.

16:07.885 --> 16:09.136
The chair don't make the man.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.263
Because no matter how long you sit
in this chair,

16:11.346 --> 16:15.392
you will always be second place.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.021
But not just to me, God hates you.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.903
I like how you got my chair,
but couldn't...

16:26.653 --> 16:28.197
Couldn't make the switch, could you?

16:28.947 --> 16:30.741
This is something
you can relate to, Barry?

16:31.867 --> 16:35.787
You know what I mean? Everybody standing
around watching like this is a music show.

16:37.039 --> 16:42.211
Is that my mocha choca king sitting
in a regular ass chair?

16:42.294 --> 16:44.922
Well, I'm just feeling
generous today, gentlemen, that's it.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.549
Then why the Payday Loan?

16:49.134 --> 16:50.469
What, they called you?

16:50.552 --> 16:53.013
Asked a bunch of weird questions.
Like your nipple shape.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.890
I said Africa, I kept it safe.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.767
-That's accurate.
-Right there.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.353
My man.
You told them I was a good dude?

16:59.436 --> 17:01.438
Of course I did.
You know what I'm saying?

17:01.522 --> 17:04.983
-Right there.
-I said you had great taste in music.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.734
You said that? Look, anyway,

17:07.236 --> 17:09.488
I just have a very special purchase
I had to make.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.698
These loan companies
don't fuck around though, man.

17:11.781 --> 17:15.953
My uncle, he almost lost his left nut
because he defaulted on a payment.

17:16.036 --> 17:19.205
Bro, could you imagine making
a Sophie's Choice with your nutsack?

17:20.290 --> 17:22.125
It's like left truffle, right truffle.

17:22.917 --> 17:25.838
As long as I cash out
by tonight as planned,

17:25.921 --> 17:29.341
me and my truffles are perfectly fine.

17:30.759 --> 17:31.718
I love truffles.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.179
Y'all thought process puzzles me.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.391
I'll sign you up
for the package right now.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.935
Holy shit.
Man, look at the scoreboard.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.939
-Yes, ma'am.
-That's real cute.

17:44.523 --> 17:45.732
Real cute, rookie.

17:45.816 --> 17:47.693
Let's go get another one, Big Fred.

17:47.776 --> 17:50.863
This is Barry calling from TeleWin,
and I'm trying to upgrade you now.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.700
I like to shoot straight.

17:54.783 --> 17:58.370
Better cable service while he's gone,
fucking all those other women.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.247
I was born and raised in Texas like you.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.709
Sometimes I like to grab the bull by
its horns and do you know what to them.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.878
I can sign you up right now.

18:05.961 --> 18:08.046
-Hello?
-One for Barry.

18:08.672 --> 18:12.342
Whatever, dude.
Even a broken clock's right twice a day.

18:12.426 --> 18:14.887
Absolutely, sir, I'm from fucking Boston.

18:14.970 --> 18:18.515
-Yeah. Fucking Boston, I went to BU.
-Clock's ticking.

18:18.599 --> 18:19.766
Two banger for Barry.

18:19.850 --> 18:23.061
He's having a little lucky streak.
That's all good.

18:23.145 --> 18:26.023
-Triple play for Barry.
-Shit, Barry.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.319
You can learn from your failures.

18:30.402 --> 18:33.405
Hey, our phones, anybody's phone,
Debra, is your phone messed up?

18:33.488 --> 18:35.574
That last company failed you,
but we won't.

18:35.657 --> 18:39.328
Kasey still has a clear lead,
but he's clearly under pressure.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.330
The same pressure he faced in law school.

18:41.413 --> 18:43.582
The same pressure that caused him
to flunk out.

18:43.665 --> 18:44.499
Dropped out.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.213
All right, choir boy, I got you.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.465
Another single play for Barry.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.091
Fucking is it hot?

18:53.175 --> 18:56.553
-Two banger for Barry.
-Debra, can you turn the a.c. up?

18:58.055 --> 19:00.807
-Another one for Barry.
-Debra, you're way behind.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.684
So don't even look at me
with judging eyes.

19:02.768 --> 19:04.394
Yeah, you've reached Kasey.

19:05.729 --> 19:06.730
Fuck.

19:08.607 --> 19:10.943
-Fuck.
-How's this for a bonus?

19:11.527 --> 19:14.488
24-carat gold-plated iPad.

19:15.864 --> 19:19.451
Can I get a word in? No, I called you,
so you have to wonder what I'm--

19:19.535 --> 19:21.286
As soon as I called, you started yelling.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.498
-Hello?
-It's Christine.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.044
Oh, hey. Hey, babe.

19:29.127 --> 19:32.089
Hey, I'm just checking
if you made the reservation.

19:33.841 --> 19:35.092
Did I make the reservations?

19:35.926 --> 19:38.762
Yes, oh, sorry.
Of course I made the reservation.

19:39.638 --> 19:40.973
I'm writing you down right now.

19:41.056 --> 19:42.349
Are you okay? You sound off.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.143
No, no, I sound weird? You know...

19:45.227 --> 19:46.228
Fuck you.

19:46.311 --> 19:49.398
I don't sound weird,
you're the one who sounds weird.

19:49.481 --> 19:52.776
I'm just at work making deals
like Gordon Gekko.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.695
Oh, I bet you are.

19:54.778 --> 19:57.698
I bet Gordon Gekko
would be making money right now

19:57.781 --> 20:01.326
and probably would be allowed
personal calls from his very own office.

20:02.578 --> 20:05.038
Get off the damn phone, Liz.
Hey, babe, listen, I gotta go.

20:05.789 --> 20:10.085
Okay? I have to--
I will talk to you later.

20:10.169 --> 20:11.086
All right, bye.

20:12.171 --> 20:13.088
Time.

20:18.302 --> 20:19.136
Huddle up.

20:21.889 --> 20:23.807
Looks like Kasey's got it again.

20:23.891 --> 20:26.310
-How many more you got, king?
-What, what?

20:27.895 --> 20:29.396
-My man.
-How many more you got?

20:29.479 --> 20:31.815
-How many do I...
-Yeah, how many more do you got?

20:33.066 --> 20:35.861
-Oh, no, that's it right there.
-That's it?

20:35.944 --> 20:39.489
I'm saying when you put all
the numbers together combined, yeah.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.783
Anybody else got anything?

20:41.867 --> 20:42.701
Just one.

20:43.202 --> 20:45.746
Yeah, well, sorry,
single play's not enough.

20:45.829 --> 20:48.165
Just one triple play.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.210
Yes.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.340
Holy shit. That's...

20:57.758 --> 20:58.884
You win by one.

21:00.469 --> 21:01.970
Oh, that's major.

21:02.554 --> 21:03.430
Good shit, Barry.

21:03.514 --> 21:05.182
I demand a recount on that.

21:05.265 --> 21:08.894
Single but stable family home.
I got her to go for the triple.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.856
Easy, easy, okay?

21:12.940 --> 21:15.484
I mean, I just had a lucky day,
I'm not sure how it happened.

21:16.068 --> 21:18.403
You used the Kasey Method,
I bet that's what happened.

21:19.029 --> 21:20.864
Actually, I used my own method.

21:24.159 --> 21:25.327
And don't forget my smile.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.455
I mean, they may not see it,
but they can feel it.

21:29.498 --> 21:32.417
Looks like the king
and his method is dead.

21:32.501 --> 21:33.836
Barry, take the chair.

21:38.715 --> 21:39.800
Hey, but listen...

21:41.093 --> 21:43.804
They just give you a chair
and they snatch it right back.

21:43.887 --> 21:46.640
-I know, every once in a while...
-Have a great weekend.

21:49.852 --> 21:51.812
You leave it out in the sun.

21:55.107 --> 21:57.734
Barry, dude, you, oh my, don't do that.

21:57.818 --> 21:59.778
You do that, you could've been a victim.

21:59.862 --> 22:02.197
-I'm sorry, Kase.
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22:02.281 --> 22:06.034
I just came over here because
I feel like you should have this.

22:07.035 --> 22:11.039
-You deserve it.
-Honestly, bro, I wasn't really trying.

22:11.874 --> 22:15.127
You know what I mean? I had an
off day and it was a lot going on,

22:15.210 --> 22:18.088
so you deserve that, you keep it, man.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.175
Have a blessed day, Kasey.

22:24.261 --> 22:25.262
Fuck, man.

22:27.014 --> 22:28.182
Thirty minutes.

22:28.682 --> 22:32.186
I just need 30 minutes, I need to get
this bonus for the weekend, please.

22:32.269 --> 22:35.355
You already get the best leads
on the floor, what more do you want?

22:35.439 --> 22:38.525
I can't tell.
The way I'm striking out out there.

22:38.609 --> 22:40.611
There's something going on
with my sheets.

22:40.694 --> 22:41.570
You had a bad day.

22:43.947 --> 22:45.407
Liz, Liz.

22:47.951 --> 22:52.164
Liz, I'm rather sure this wouldn't be
your first "adjustment."

22:52.789 --> 22:55.042
You know what I'm talking about.
Latrice, last year,

22:55.125 --> 22:58.003
I'm pretty sure
you helped her make quota, right?

22:58.086 --> 22:59.838
Her kid had leukaemia.

22:59.922 --> 23:01.840
Damn it, Liz, I got leukaemia!

23:02.966 --> 23:05.427
I don't have leukaemia,
I don't have leukaemia.

23:05.511 --> 23:07.971
You know, but I got something worse
than leukaemia, right?

23:08.055 --> 23:09.890
I have a gigantic loan I gotta pay back,

23:09.973 --> 23:15.062
or else I may lose something...
that I may never get back.

23:15.145 --> 23:17.689
Liz, look at me, look at me.
Hey, hey, hey.

23:17.773 --> 23:21.860
Right, I make one bundle sale, boom,
it'll put me over the top, and we're good.

23:21.944 --> 23:24.029
No handouts,
let me go out there and do my thing.

23:24.947 --> 23:25.948
Please.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.201
-Sorry, Kasey.
-Fuck!

23:47.427 --> 23:49.763
-Hey.
-Hey, hey babe, listen.

23:51.223 --> 23:52.808
You're never gonna believe this, but,

23:52.891 --> 23:54.810
the restaurant bumped
our reservation to 8:30.

23:54.893 --> 23:57.688
Oh, damn. I was just leaving my place.

23:57.771 --> 24:00.315
Yeah, I know, I know, that sucks.

24:00.399 --> 24:02.401
But hey, look, when we get there,

24:02.484 --> 24:04.611
I'm gonna give the manager
a stern talking-to.

24:04.695 --> 24:06.613
Maybe they'll give us...

24:06.697 --> 24:08.907
Maybe they'll comp dessert
or something like that.

24:08.991 --> 24:11.034
It's cool, it's just 30 minutes,
we'll survive.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.079
You know,
I've got a good feeling about this dinner.

24:14.162 --> 24:15.956
-Oh, you do?
-I do.

24:16.039 --> 24:17.249
So don't mess it up.

24:17.958 --> 24:18.834
Come on, babe.

24:18.917 --> 24:19.751
You know me.

24:20.711 --> 24:23.255
Okay, you used to quit talking
before I could change my mind.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.757
I can't hear a word you're saying
because I gotta go, bye.

24:33.098 --> 24:33.932
Showtime.

24:40.814 --> 24:43.358
Come on.
Where's those fucking call sheets?

24:49.198 --> 24:50.032
Come on.

24:56.747 --> 24:57.748
Oh, shit.

25:17.059 --> 25:18.977
I swear to God,
don't you ever leave me again.

25:20.729 --> 25:21.730
I missed you.

25:23.023 --> 25:24.274
What do we got?

25:25.275 --> 25:27.694
Okay. Let's get another one, Big Fred.

25:34.368 --> 25:35.619
Time to get creative.

25:37.788 --> 25:40.165
I know somebody forgot
they're on this stupid list.

25:47.673 --> 25:50.259
Hello there. Oh, is this Kate Carpenter?

25:51.051 --> 25:52.970
Yeah, this is Kasey at TeleWin.

25:53.053 --> 25:55.097
Hello? Hello?

25:56.181 --> 25:57.015
Fuck.

25:59.142 --> 26:00.853
Shit, come on.

26:06.817 --> 26:10.028
Hello, Reef. Reef, yeah.
I got a deal for you, man.

26:10.112 --> 26:12.155
I shouldn't be calling you this late,
but, hello?

26:12.990 --> 26:15.033
Shit, maybe a little too pervy.

26:19.788 --> 26:21.582
Bingo. Instagram.

26:21.665 --> 26:26.253
No, you strike me
as a Facebook type of individual

26:26.879 --> 26:28.797
due to your advanced age.

26:32.092 --> 26:34.761
Phil French. Bingo.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.683
Phil French, Phil French.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.393
Phil, Phil, Phil.

26:43.103 --> 26:45.606
Phil, Phil, yeah, Phil French.

26:48.483 --> 26:49.318
Hello?

26:50.110 --> 26:51.486
Hey there, Asa.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.365
Yeah, it's a voice out of the past.

26:55.449 --> 26:58.327
Phil French from marching band,
how you doing, buddy?

26:58.410 --> 27:00.954
Phil? Phil, is that really you?

27:01.038 --> 27:02.497
Yeah, it's me.

27:03.415 --> 27:04.625
Long time, eh?

27:04.708 --> 27:06.502
You bet you it's been a while.

27:07.377 --> 27:09.463
-Well, how are you, my man?
-Oh, me?

27:09.546 --> 27:12.090
Well, I'm in the Valley.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.801
Yeah, I'm in the Valley, you know.

27:15.719 --> 27:18.430
I was thinking about old times,
and I thought I'd look you up.

27:18.514 --> 27:20.307
You still playing that horn?

27:20.390 --> 27:22.017
Oh, you damn right I am.

27:22.768 --> 27:25.312
You can't pull my mouth off
of that horn if you tried.

27:26.438 --> 27:28.106
I suck, I blow, I do it all.

27:28.607 --> 27:30.025
I'm in the big band now.

27:30.108 --> 27:34.488
You know, weddings, bar mitzvahs,
assisted suicides, the whole thing.

27:35.364 --> 27:37.282
-Hey, don't I know it.
-Yeah.

27:37.366 --> 27:38.700
Well, haven't you retired?

27:38.784 --> 27:40.327
Well, I'll tell you this.

27:40.410 --> 27:44.248
You know, I didn't work enough quarters
to get my Social Security,

27:44.331 --> 27:48.043
then the bursitis started flaring up
again along with the gout

27:48.126 --> 27:49.962
and what have you, and such, and so forth.

27:50.045 --> 27:52.506
And so, now I'm over here selling cable.

27:53.340 --> 27:57.678
Say, you wouldn't happen to be
in the marketplace for cable,

27:58.512 --> 27:59.680
Internet, or phone?

27:59.763 --> 28:02.266
Hell, the entire bundle.
I tell you what, you know,

28:02.349 --> 28:04.977
I could hook you up
with a pretty sweet deal.

28:05.060 --> 28:07.312
First three months,
hell, four months for free.

28:07.396 --> 28:08.564
Oh, I'd love that.

28:08.647 --> 28:11.608
You know, I've got a son who's looking
to break into your business,

28:11.692 --> 28:15.320
that telemarketing thing that y'all do.

28:15.404 --> 28:16.947
Which one do you work for?

28:17.030 --> 28:18.323
TeleWin, Northridge.

28:18.407 --> 28:21.326
Right up the block
from Tarzana, small town.

28:21.410 --> 28:24.037
You know? But tell your son
he can call me here anytime.

28:24.121 --> 28:26.999
I see. You know,
I'm still in the Valley myself.

28:27.082 --> 28:27.958
Well, my son and I.

28:28.041 --> 28:30.043
Like I said before, that's great,

28:30.127 --> 28:32.421
he can call me here
whenever he feels the need to.

28:32.504 --> 28:35.966
But let me take care of you.

28:36.049 --> 28:39.428
Let's get you set up, huh?

28:39.511 --> 28:41.889
We can go out and get that drink
and talk about old times

28:41.972 --> 28:43.974
and all the loose women you used
to run through.

28:44.057 --> 28:45.058
Now, Phil.

28:45.726 --> 28:48.061
Let me ask you a question now.

28:48.145 --> 28:52.733
How do they pay your commissions,
halos or Hail Marys?

28:52.816 --> 28:55.611
-Come again?
-Maybe harps, asshole,

28:55.694 --> 28:57.154
because Phil French,

28:57.237 --> 29:00.866
you died five years ago
from alcoholic poisoning.

29:00.949 --> 29:05.287
Buried in a rainstorm at Forest Lawn
like God was crying.

29:05.370 --> 29:07.039
Like God was crying.

29:07.122 --> 29:09.208
Yeah, I know, that was a sad time.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.672
First off, asshole,
I'm on the do not fucking call list.

29:15.756 --> 29:18.926
I've got a particular set of skills.

29:19.009 --> 29:20.552
-Blah, blah, blah.
-Wherever you are.

29:20.636 --> 29:22.763
Take it easy, cowboy, pull the saddle out.

29:22.846 --> 29:24.556
Gotta go. Motherfucker.

29:25.432 --> 29:26.308
God. Okay.

29:29.019 --> 29:31.188
We're good, we're good, we're good.

29:33.106 --> 29:34.358
Zachary Morris.

29:34.441 --> 29:35.526
Zachary Morris.

29:36.193 --> 29:38.362
Hello, Zachary Morris?
How you doing, mate?

29:38.445 --> 29:39.947
Yeah, this is Kasey, over at...

29:40.989 --> 29:42.366
Fuck, dumb ass.

29:44.743 --> 29:47.371
Hello, you want cable? No? Fuck you. Shit.

29:47.454 --> 29:48.914
I'm all of those things, yeah.

29:49.623 --> 29:53.085
No, I cannot send you a videotape
of me shoving my hand up my own asshole.

29:53.168 --> 29:54.002
Hello?

29:54.086 --> 29:56.839
Hello, you like Internet? No?
Suck my dick.

29:58.924 --> 30:01.885
Come on, Big Fred.
What the fuck is going on?

30:01.969 --> 30:03.971
I got this, this is nothing, dude.

30:04.054 --> 30:05.931
This is nothing, bro.

30:09.768 --> 30:12.020
Hello, Genevieve?
It's that time of the month again.

30:12.104 --> 30:13.897
Well, not like that, I mean...

30:14.439 --> 30:17.067
Fuck, man. You've got to be kidding me.

30:18.193 --> 30:23.198
I am a swan, and this is my pond.

30:24.491 --> 30:28.495
I am a swan, and this is my pond.

30:28.579 --> 30:31.456
Oh, my God, you look so stupid right now,
wow, this is amazing.

30:31.540 --> 30:33.041
I'm channelling my chi.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.043
-Jesus Christ.
-What are you still doing here?

30:35.794 --> 30:39.339
Catching up on some late work,
but the power's out on our floor, so...

30:39.423 --> 30:40.966
Well, it's a shit building, brother.

30:41.466 --> 30:43.760
But maintenance is coming,
they'll be here in a minute.

30:44.344 --> 30:45.846
That's good. I'm glad you're on it.

30:46.513 --> 30:47.472
Self-love, baby.

30:47.556 --> 30:48.640
Try it sometime.

30:50.350 --> 30:51.768
Good, thank you.

30:52.561 --> 30:53.687
Jesus Christ.

30:54.563 --> 30:55.898
Hey, man, you Jim?

30:55.981 --> 30:57.232
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

30:58.817 --> 31:00.152
So you got your stuff?

31:00.235 --> 31:01.570
-Yeah.
-Follow me.

31:01.653 --> 31:02.529
Following.

31:05.532 --> 31:08.660
Hey, man. I'm a security enforcement
specialist, not a valet.

31:08.744 --> 31:09.786
I can't hear you.

31:14.166 --> 31:19.004
I am beautiful, I am kind, I am smart.

31:23.967 --> 31:26.178
Hey, what is it you guys
do around here anyway?

31:27.012 --> 31:28.889
-Telemarketing.
-No shit?

31:29.515 --> 31:31.141
This is where they sell me Viagra.

31:32.726 --> 31:35.354
Yeah, no Viagra here.
Well, not yet at least.

31:35.437 --> 31:38.982
-Just, cable, Internet, phone, you know.
-Not that I need it.

31:41.026 --> 31:42.277
Oh, fuck.

31:42.361 --> 31:43.237
Oh, boy.

31:45.113 --> 31:48.200
-Say, Jim, is it?
-Yes, sir.

31:48.283 --> 31:50.661
Let me ask you something,
how's your Internet connection?

31:51.537 --> 31:52.412
So-so.

31:52.496 --> 31:54.373
So-so? That's not good.

31:54.998 --> 31:56.625
TV, phone?

31:56.708 --> 32:00.671
-Oh, I see what you're doing.
-It depends on if you're buying.

32:01.296 --> 32:05.425
No, I don't really have time for the tube.
I'm just kind of tied up with this stuff.

32:06.009 --> 32:08.720
Right. Speaking of which, how we looking?

32:08.804 --> 32:09.638
You know...

32:11.348 --> 32:14.351
I brought the wrong tool bag,
I'm gonna have to run back out to the van.

32:14.434 --> 32:15.561
Okay, all right.

32:20.107 --> 32:24.194
So, I mean, how long is that gonna be?
I have...

32:24.278 --> 32:25.779
I got a date tonight.

32:25.863 --> 32:27.573
-Oh, lucky fucker.
-Yeah.

32:28.365 --> 32:30.158
About 10-15 minutes tops.

32:30.242 --> 32:31.368
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

32:32.119 --> 32:33.495
10-15, 10-15.

32:34.413 --> 32:35.247
Shit.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.459
What the fuck?

32:40.043 --> 32:41.461
Come on, dude...

32:52.973 --> 32:53.849
Fuck.

32:56.476 --> 32:57.311
Jesus.

33:06.486 --> 33:07.738
What the fuck?

33:09.907 --> 33:10.908
Big Fred?

33:11.617 --> 33:14.411
No. Rise and shine.

33:16.663 --> 33:17.664
Oh, shit.

33:18.332 --> 33:19.666
Are you from the Payday Loan?

33:20.584 --> 33:21.418
Hey.

33:23.587 --> 33:24.880
Hey, man, look.

33:24.963 --> 33:27.049
I can get you your money, I swear.

33:27.132 --> 33:29.635
Just don't cut off my dick.

33:32.888 --> 33:33.931
I'm Asa.

33:34.556 --> 33:36.141
Asa Ellenbogen.

33:37.643 --> 33:39.311
How you doing, Kasey Miller?

33:39.895 --> 33:43.440
Or should I say, Phil French?

33:44.650 --> 33:46.610
Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.

33:46.693 --> 33:48.820
No, I'm not kidding you.

33:50.197 --> 33:51.615
Where's the electrician?

33:53.951 --> 33:57.829
Well, let's just say,
he probably won't be coming back.

33:58.539 --> 33:59.373
Fuck.

34:01.250 --> 34:02.960
Okay, give me my phone, dude.

34:03.043 --> 34:05.462
-Where's my phone?
-Looking for this?

34:06.922 --> 34:07.756
Shit!

34:08.257 --> 34:13.762
More like a big old brick with a computer,
camera, Interwebs, what have you.

34:13.846 --> 34:15.597
I'm gonna keep this in my pocket for you.

34:16.139 --> 34:17.014
Okay.

34:17.850 --> 34:18.684
Okay, man.

34:19.351 --> 34:21.478
I don't know what kind of game
you're playing here,

34:21.562 --> 34:25.774
but let's just call it even
and go our separate ways.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.193
Go our separate ways?

34:29.695 --> 34:31.612
We was just getting to know each other.

34:33.364 --> 34:37.703
Unlike you, I'm a man of my word.

34:37.786 --> 34:40.789
-Hey, look man, just listen.
-I wish I could say the same for you.

34:40.873 --> 34:45.710
Look, I get it, I tried to sell you,
and that's on me, I'm so sorry about that.

34:45.793 --> 34:48.839
But I was in a real bad position.
I was in a fucked-up spot.

34:48.922 --> 34:51.800
I had to pay back this
Payday loan because I lost a contest.

34:51.884 --> 34:53.677
Oh, well, that's a shame.

34:53.760 --> 34:59.766
How about if you was to hook me up
with the cable-Internet-phone bundle,

35:00.350 --> 35:02.436
free for life, would you win?

35:02.519 --> 35:04.897
With the NFL Sunday Ticket included?

35:07.983 --> 35:10.152
-I can't--
-Of course you can't!

35:13.906 --> 35:15.490
You know, while you were sleeping,

35:16.700 --> 35:21.580
I was thinking of all the fun ways
I could lay you off.

35:22.164 --> 35:24.666
You know, when you hang around
this place long enough,

35:24.750 --> 35:26.919
-you develop quite the active imagination.
-Yeah.

35:27.002 --> 35:30.005
You ever imagine you'd be tied
to your office chair

35:30.088 --> 35:33.884
with some old coot on disability
with a fucking gun to your head?

35:35.135 --> 35:39.223
To be fair, death threats happen
all the time, it's a part of the job.

35:39.306 --> 35:42.809
But no, this is the first time
that it actually--

35:42.893 --> 35:45.229
Oh, first time someone actually did it?

35:45.854 --> 35:47.648
Yeah. That about sums it up.

35:49.066 --> 35:52.694
Hey, look, man, listen. About this
whole pretending to be your friend thing.

35:52.778 --> 35:55.531
-My dead friend.
-Yeah.

35:55.614 --> 35:56.990
Yup, because he's dead,

35:57.074 --> 35:59.409
your dead friend thing
with the funny name.

35:59.493 --> 36:02.829
-Phil French.
-Oh, he was adopted, jackass.

36:03.997 --> 36:08.085
Yeah, I know, and for that I am so sorry,
about the adoption and everything.

36:08.168 --> 36:10.963
I had nothing to do with the adoption,
but I'm sorry anyway.

36:11.046 --> 36:13.090
-Are you now?
-Yeah, truly.

36:13.173 --> 36:14.925
You know, my grandfather, he used to say,

36:15.676 --> 36:18.512
this country was not built on--

36:18.595 --> 36:21.974
Stop selling for once
in your goddamn life.

36:22.975 --> 36:25.644
Do you know
how to have a normal conversation?

36:25.727 --> 36:28.105
Well, damn it, Asa,
under normal circumstances, yes.

36:28.188 --> 36:29.982
But this ain't exactly normal now, is it?

36:30.524 --> 36:33.026
In fact, I'll have you know,
that people around this office,

36:33.527 --> 36:35.237
they call me the king at conversations.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.698
Yeah. Words are my tools.

36:37.781 --> 36:38.907
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

36:38.991 --> 36:40.617
Words are your sales tools.

36:40.701 --> 36:42.619
I'm talking about real talk.

36:42.703 --> 36:44.580
Here, now.

36:44.663 --> 36:46.248
Let's start with a simple question.

36:47.332 --> 36:50.169
-Why?
-Why what?

36:50.252 --> 36:51.879
Why'd you do it, Kasey?

36:51.962 --> 36:54.298
Look, I told you already. Come on, man.

36:54.381 --> 36:56.508
I told you, I had to pay back
a debt, you know?

36:56.592 --> 36:57.426
For what?

36:59.428 --> 37:01.722
For a ring. An engagement ring.

37:02.514 --> 37:04.725
This girl, she's the love of my life.

37:06.852 --> 37:09.313
Am I supposed to feel all warm
and squishy inside?

37:09.396 --> 37:11.815
Look, I tell you what,
let me just go to my car and I'll--

37:11.899 --> 37:13.066
You ain't going nowhere.

37:15.277 --> 37:16.945
Liar, liar.

37:17.946 --> 37:19.740
Okay, hey. Hey, hey, look.

37:19.823 --> 37:21.909
My monitor, my Instagram is up.

37:21.992 --> 37:23.368
Just no B.S., no lies.

37:23.452 --> 37:26.330
-Right there.
-Just hit a key? Where do I see it?

37:26.413 --> 37:28.624
It's right there,
on the top corner right there.

37:28.707 --> 37:29.958
Well, what am I looking at?

37:30.042 --> 37:32.169
That's her. That's her, right there.

37:32.961 --> 37:34.755
Well, ain't no mention of you.

37:35.464 --> 37:37.883
Well, you know,
we like to keep our relationship low.

37:37.966 --> 37:39.051
Like Jay-Z and Beyoncé.

37:39.134 --> 37:41.553
Bet when you found out they were together
you were amazed.

37:41.637 --> 37:45.015
Well, lookie here.
In her status, it says she's single.

37:45.891 --> 37:48.435
-Dang, is that what that says?
-That's what that says.

37:48.519 --> 37:51.939
Single, ready to mingle.
Yeah, you see my point, though?

37:52.022 --> 37:55.734
-I do. It's bullshit, that's the point.
-You see my point?

37:56.318 --> 37:57.903
I don't know what that is.

37:57.986 --> 38:01.532
Look, let's play a game.

38:01.615 --> 38:04.284
-You like contests, Kasey?
-Fuck.

38:05.035 --> 38:06.453
What kind of contests we talking?

38:07.120 --> 38:14.086
Now, I'm gonna give you one hour
to apologise on behalf of yourself

38:14.169 --> 38:18.423
and, well, all you wretched scum-sucking
telemarketing sales leeches,

38:18.507 --> 38:22.719
to apologise to as many
of these people as you can.

38:23.554 --> 38:26.974
You want me to call the people
on the do not call list

38:27.391 --> 38:31.728
and apologise on behalf of the people
who made them want to be put

38:31.812 --> 38:34.064
on the do not call list
in the first place?

38:34.147 --> 38:36.066
And you didn't even take a note.

38:36.525 --> 38:38.861
I don't think they'll be too receptive.

38:38.944 --> 38:42.239
Which can be a problem
for people seeking forgiveness,

38:42.322 --> 38:45.284
it's true, but that doesn't mean
you don't need to be forgiven, Kasey.

38:46.326 --> 38:47.160
I guess.

38:48.620 --> 38:49.454
You guess.

38:50.080 --> 38:54.918
Well, don't you think that if you wronged
someone and you know it,

38:55.002 --> 38:59.089
that you have to seek forgiveness?
That you have a responsibility?

38:59.173 --> 39:02.134
Okay, man, now this is starting
to sound a lot like Sunday School,

39:02.217 --> 39:03.886
and I hate Sunday School.

39:03.969 --> 39:05.929
Sister Johnson was my teacher,
she had no legs,

39:06.013 --> 39:08.223
she used to make me carry her around
like a backpack.

39:10.100 --> 39:13.103
This is the night
of your redemption, Kasey.

39:14.438 --> 39:19.026
If you can get just one person
to accept your apology...

39:21.653 --> 39:22.696
then you can go home.

39:23.739 --> 39:27.993
Now, you see, the choice is all yours.

39:28.785 --> 39:31.663
Okay, what if they don't accept?

39:33.207 --> 39:36.793
Well, then you can give my very best
to Phil French.

39:38.504 --> 39:39.880
Let's get to dialling.

39:43.050 --> 39:44.426
Oh, I'm so fucked.

39:44.510 --> 39:45.385
I'm so fucked.

39:45.469 --> 39:46.887
-Now.
-Okay, all right.

39:47.721 --> 39:48.931
Oh, shit!

39:49.723 --> 39:50.724
Goddamn it, man!

39:51.350 --> 39:54.061
You son of a bitch, you shot Big Fred.

39:54.144 --> 39:57.564
Apologies to Fred.
At least now he knows it's loaded.

39:58.774 --> 39:59.691
All right, man.

40:00.275 --> 40:01.985
-Speakerphone.
-Okay, okay.

40:06.615 --> 40:07.699
Give it your best.

40:08.325 --> 40:09.243
Yeah, who this?

40:09.326 --> 40:10.494
Congratulations.

40:11.203 --> 40:16.583
You have been personally selected
to receive a once-in-a-lifetime apology.

40:17.251 --> 40:24.091
On behalf of myself as well as
all telemarketers around the whole globe.

40:25.801 --> 40:29.972
We are deeply sorry
for all of our past transgressions.

40:30.055 --> 40:33.058
-You tripping.
-So that's your approach?

40:33.767 --> 40:36.645
Maybe I should just shoot you now,
put you out of your misery.

40:36.728 --> 40:37.980
No, no, look, look.

40:38.730 --> 40:41.942
To be fair, I'm not in my element.
And RIP Big Fred, you know what I mean?

40:42.776 --> 40:45.279
I miss you, my nigga. I gotta get focused.

40:46.113 --> 40:48.699
It's showtime, you motherfucker.
You ain't shit, yes I am.

40:49.324 --> 40:50.909
-Dial.
-Okay, okay.

40:53.871 --> 40:57.040
Hey, how you doing there Mrs. Goldfarb,
how's this evening treating you?

40:58.125 --> 40:59.626
Fine. What is this about?

40:59.710 --> 41:03.213
I want to apologise on behalf of myself
and all the telemarketers that

41:03.297 --> 41:07.467
may have contacted you and called your
mobile or your home phone in the past.

41:07.551 --> 41:10.929
Do you accept our apology?

41:11.722 --> 41:14.099
-You've got to be kidding me.
-No, okay.

41:14.183 --> 41:17.144
I'm not kidding you. Let's start there.
This is a very serious thing.

41:17.227 --> 41:20.105
-Do you accept our apology?
-I'm hanging up now.

41:20.189 --> 41:23.108
No, no, please, don't hang up.
Okay, I'm losing my thread here.

41:23.192 --> 41:25.611
I want to give you something deep
and personal.

41:25.694 --> 41:28.030
William, there's a creep on the phone.

41:28.113 --> 41:30.240
You're in big trouble now, mister.

41:30.324 --> 41:32.201
-Look here, you piece of shit.
-Fuck me.

41:32.284 --> 41:33.952
I advise you to hang up now,

41:34.036 --> 41:37.289
or I'm gonna shove my shotgun
down your throat and make an omelette

41:37.372 --> 41:40.167
with your goddamn tonsils, you freak.

41:40.250 --> 41:41.668
And I deserve that, sir.

41:42.294 --> 41:44.838
I truly do deserve that.
You have yourself a blessed evening.

41:46.882 --> 41:49.176
You know, my wife used
to get these kinds of calls,

41:50.177 --> 41:53.388
but she was kinder than me.
She was too kind.

41:54.389 --> 41:57.184
You know, she used to think about you kids

41:57.267 --> 41:59.937
in places like this
trying to make ends meet.

42:00.020 --> 42:05.234
Kind of made her a perfect prey
for the vultures.

42:06.443 --> 42:09.821
You'd call her house,
you'd call her cell phone.

42:10.614 --> 42:16.453
You'd sell, sell, sell and she'd
buy, buy, buy, and then we'd fight.

42:18.705 --> 42:20.249
I'm sorry about that, sir.

42:20.832 --> 42:21.875
No, you aren't.

42:24.002 --> 42:27.422
What's your girlfriend's name again?
The one that says she's single?

42:29.091 --> 42:30.509
That was just a misunderstanding,

42:30.592 --> 42:33.220
we're actually together,
I just want to let you know that.

42:33.303 --> 42:35.681
-Yeah? Christine.
-Her name is Christine.

42:36.223 --> 42:39.726
Let's say a miracle were to happen,
and the two of you were to get hitched.

42:40.561 --> 42:44.648
Now, if she bought a load of crap
every day on the phone,

42:45.774 --> 42:47.568
would that be good for your marriage?

42:48.402 --> 42:51.655
To be fair, she is her own woman,
and I wouldn't have a say in the matter.

42:51.738 --> 42:53.657
But if she spent all your money.

42:55.325 --> 42:59.621
Well, you know, psychologists
in this town makes a lot of money, so...

42:59.705 --> 43:02.749
Now, I'm gonna give you one more chance
to answer my question.

43:02.833 --> 43:05.335
Would you want your future wife

43:05.419 --> 43:08.714
to buy a load of crap
from people like you?

43:10.507 --> 43:11.758
No, sir, I would not.

43:13.719 --> 43:17.097
Well, that's the first honest thing
you've said all night.

43:27.441 --> 43:28.442
Goddamn it.

43:29.568 --> 43:31.445
Listen, you're gonna get rid of this guy.

43:33.739 --> 43:36.283
-Go get, get, get.
-Okay. Okay.

43:42.789 --> 43:44.958
I swear to Christ,
if you fucking make a run for it,

43:45.834 --> 43:47.085
I'll follow you down,

43:47.169 --> 43:48.962
and I'll blow a hole
in your fucking spine.

43:49.463 --> 43:52.216
If that cop comes this way,
I'll blow a hole in his spine.

43:52.299 --> 43:54.843
Okay, fine,
so what should I tell him then?

43:55.469 --> 43:57.763
Just tap into that active imagination.

43:58.514 --> 43:59.723
Okay, I'll just lie to him.

44:07.940 --> 44:11.235
Good evening.
I didn't see you there, this glass door.

44:13.278 --> 44:17.324
We got a report about
a shot fired in the area. Heard anything?

44:17.407 --> 44:18.909
-A shot fired?
-Yeah.

44:18.992 --> 44:20.410
In this building?

44:20.494 --> 44:22.746
Wow, it's such a peaceful
community building.

44:22.829 --> 44:24.289
You know, no.

44:25.123 --> 44:26.542
Oh, now I understand.

44:27.251 --> 44:30.087
It must've been the cherry bomb.
Was it the cherry bomb?

44:30.170 --> 44:32.923
-Cherry bomb?
-It was a cherry bomb, yeah.

44:33.006 --> 44:34.550
You know it's not the 4th of July?

44:35.342 --> 44:38.011
It's not the 4th of July, and I know that.

44:38.762 --> 44:40.973
You know, we're telemarketers, right?

44:41.056 --> 44:44.017
We work late sometimes,

44:44.101 --> 44:49.022
and we play pranks on each other to build
the morale around the office, you know?

44:50.399 --> 44:51.233
Yeah, we know.

44:51.817 --> 44:55.863
-So who else is here?
-Oh, just me. I know what you're thinking.

44:55.946 --> 44:58.740
I'm the team leader,
so they look up to me,

44:58.824 --> 45:02.160
so when I'm here alone,
I still do the pranks to keep up.

45:02.244 --> 45:03.495
You know what I mean?

45:04.079 --> 45:04.955
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

45:08.041 --> 45:09.293
-All right.
-Yeah.

45:09.376 --> 45:11.503
Well, no more cherry bombs.

45:12.171 --> 45:13.672
You got it. You know?

45:13.755 --> 45:18.844
Hey, you guys sell Internet here, right?

45:19.469 --> 45:20.304
Yes, we do.

45:21.013 --> 45:24.766
My two teens are just obsessed
with goddamn online gaming.

45:25.767 --> 45:27.144
Killing my bandwidth.

45:27.227 --> 45:29.605
Think I need one of those fibre optics.

45:29.688 --> 45:32.691
-Fibre optics.
-You guys got any special deals or...

45:33.525 --> 45:36.236
I'm so sorry, sir,
your timing could not have been worse.

45:38.363 --> 45:39.865
But you know something?

45:41.074 --> 45:42.534
I'm sorry for that.

45:42.618 --> 45:44.161
I'm sorry for your inconvenience.

45:44.244 --> 45:49.041
In fact, I want to apologise on behalf
of all telemarketers, all over the world.

45:49.541 --> 45:51.418
So do you forgive us?

45:55.464 --> 45:57.591
-Sure. Sure whatever.
-All right.

45:57.674 --> 45:59.885
-That is so great to hear.
-No more cherry bombs.

45:59.968 --> 46:01.887
-No more cherry bombs.
-No more cherry bombs.

46:01.970 --> 46:03.597
-I love you.
-That's weird.

46:07.476 --> 46:09.728
-You heard, right?
-Yes, I did.

46:09.811 --> 46:13.690
Okay, I apologised on behalf
of all telemarketers and he accepted.

46:14.733 --> 46:16.401
Yeah, but it wasn't on the phone.

46:17.736 --> 46:18.737
That's our arrangement.

46:18.820 --> 46:21.073
-Come on, man.
-You wreak havoc on the phone,

46:21.156 --> 46:23.367
-you make things right on the phone.
-Shit.

46:23.450 --> 46:24.910
Excuse me?

46:26.620 --> 46:28.747
I'm saying I gotta take a shit.

46:29.748 --> 46:33.126
I've been backed up lately
and trying to eat my carrots...

46:38.090 --> 46:39.258
Four minutes.

46:39.341 --> 46:41.718
Really? You're timing my poops?

46:41.802 --> 46:43.053
Three minutes.

46:43.554 --> 46:46.265
Come on, dude, I'm backed up,
I don't know how long it's gonna...

46:47.266 --> 46:50.477
This is some unconstitutional shit,
literally. Okay?

46:51.270 --> 46:54.106
Hey, mind if I use your phone?

46:54.189 --> 46:57.150
Oh, yeah, go ahead, man.
Just dial 9 at the desk.

46:57.234 --> 46:59.820
You can't call Mexico,
sometimes it gets a little wonky.

46:59.903 --> 47:01.780
I mean the one in your pocket.

47:02.948 --> 47:03.782
My pocket?

47:05.117 --> 47:05.951
What?

47:06.827 --> 47:10.622
Oh, my God, that's crazy.

47:11.748 --> 47:13.166
Two minutes, 45 seconds.

47:13.250 --> 47:14.084
Shit, okay.

47:17.004 --> 47:18.547
Okay. Okay.

47:22.843 --> 47:24.469
What would Bruce Willis do?

47:27.431 --> 47:28.307
Oh, shit.

47:28.807 --> 47:30.309
Clock's ticking, Kasey!

47:30.392 --> 47:34.855
Yeah, I'm... It's something I ate, man.

47:36.356 --> 47:37.316
Fuck, Kasey.

47:38.108 --> 47:41.028
Don't make me come in there
and shoot you while you're shitting!

47:58.337 --> 47:59.171
Kasey!

48:04.843 --> 48:05.677
Yeah.

48:06.720 --> 48:07.554
Okay.

48:13.393 --> 48:14.478
It's bad in there.

48:15.103 --> 48:17.105
-Get.
-I had to wipe from front to back.

48:17.189 --> 48:18.190
Oh, good for you.

48:26.156 --> 48:27.366
What you looking at?

48:27.991 --> 48:29.076
This bullshit.

48:30.035 --> 48:33.789
Looks like you all want to be
the next Big Red, don't you?

48:33.872 --> 48:35.666
Fred, it's Big Fred.

48:36.458 --> 48:37.292
Was he good?

48:38.210 --> 48:40.838
They say he sold
the downtown Marriott, so...

48:40.921 --> 48:42.673
Well, that must've been some commission.

48:43.298 --> 48:45.217
Yeah, and they didn't pay him
in halos either.

48:45.884 --> 48:49.805
-Looks like Barry is the next Fred.
-No.

48:51.181 --> 48:54.351
That's beginner's luck, unfortunately.

48:54.852 --> 48:55.686
Well, now,

48:56.770 --> 49:01.942
if it had have happened like that,
we'd have never met.

49:15.747 --> 49:16.874
Hello, Ms. Daniels.

49:18.917 --> 49:19.877
She hung up.

49:20.377 --> 49:22.129
All right, loser, dial another.

49:22.212 --> 49:25.507
Come on, Asa.
Really? How much longer we doing this for?

49:25.591 --> 49:27.551
That attitude will get you fired.

49:27.634 --> 49:28.677
You don't get it, man.

49:29.428 --> 49:32.347
-This isn't me, I don't really do this.
-Do what?

49:33.307 --> 49:35.934
You know, call up people
and pretend to be their dead friend,

49:36.018 --> 49:38.979
-you don't understand.
-No, I understand perfectly.

49:39.062 --> 49:41.607
You want to buy a ring for a girl
who doesn't want to put

49:41.690 --> 49:43.901
your goddamn name on her Snapperface.

49:45.235 --> 49:47.613
Now, oh, and keep it on speakerphone.

49:47.696 --> 49:50.157
No more gimmicks, no more lies. Come on.

49:53.118 --> 49:54.494
Dial. Wait.

49:58.916 --> 50:01.335
-Message from Christine.
-Really?

50:02.044 --> 50:06.882
"You are the worst person ever
for not calling me back.

50:07.925 --> 50:09.301
Never call me again.

50:09.384 --> 50:13.347
In fact, you can erase my number."

50:15.057 --> 50:17.809
Snap, crackle, pop.

50:17.893 --> 50:20.187
She said-- She wrote all that?

50:20.270 --> 50:24.274
Indeed. I guess Bey-Z 2.0 ended after all.

50:24.358 --> 50:27.778
Okay, look.
Keep me locked up. That's fine.

50:27.861 --> 50:30.405
I need to text her back,
because if I don't text her back,

50:30.489 --> 50:34.034
she'll think something's wrong, and it is,
you're trying to kill me, you know, so...

50:34.117 --> 50:38.038
We'll probably just
prolong the inevitable, you know.

50:38.539 --> 50:40.999
Seen it all too often,
see how guys like you end up.

50:42.417 --> 50:45.504
Alone, nothing but your lies.

50:46.880 --> 50:48.257
Why don't you go ahead and dial?

50:49.925 --> 50:50.843
Put a smile on.

51:05.399 --> 51:07.276
-Hello?
-Hello, ma'am.

51:08.026 --> 51:10.946
I'm calling on behalf
of telemarketers everywhere.

51:11.572 --> 51:13.073
Kasey, is that you?

51:13.657 --> 51:15.033
Yes, it is.

51:15.993 --> 51:19.705
Your voice sounds different,
but I recognised the number.

51:19.788 --> 51:22.291
I never did get my Rick James wig.

51:25.127 --> 51:26.587
Mrs. Hanks, hi.

51:28.589 --> 51:30.799
Yeah, about that, I am so sorry.

51:30.883 --> 51:31.800
Sorry?

51:31.884 --> 51:36.096
Young man, I think I owe you an apology
for that video that's been going around.

51:36.180 --> 51:39.516
That granddaughter of mine
is too darn overprotective,

51:39.600 --> 51:40.809
watches me like a hawk.

51:41.518 --> 51:44.605
Hell, I'm surprised you were
able to call me on this old line

51:44.688 --> 51:47.191
since you put me on that,
what's it called?

51:47.274 --> 51:48.734
The do not call list.

51:48.817 --> 51:50.402
Yeah, that's the one.

51:51.445 --> 51:53.238
I'm glad you did anyways.

51:53.322 --> 51:55.741
You're helping to keep America safe.

51:55.824 --> 51:59.578
Such a sweet young man.
I was hoping to get a chance to see you.

51:59.661 --> 52:02.873
Thank you, you're sweet too.
Listen, I...

52:05.542 --> 52:07.794
The reason I'm calling is because I...

52:12.382 --> 52:14.426
The reason I'm calling is...

52:17.804 --> 52:21.558
Actually, ma'am,
I'm just calling to say hi.

52:21.642 --> 52:23.727
Well, thank you, Kasey.

52:24.895 --> 52:27.231
Thank you, ma'am.
You have a good night.

52:27.731 --> 52:30.526
Well, you have a great night too.
Okay, bye-bye.

52:31.735 --> 52:32.569
Bye.

52:36.698 --> 52:39.368
Well, ain't that something, Kasey Miller.

52:40.202 --> 52:45.123
I have never witnessed
something so genuinely touching.

52:46.041 --> 52:48.168
So genuinely heartfelt.

52:48.252 --> 52:53.632
And yet somehow so thoroughly disgusting.

52:54.299 --> 52:58.637
In all my days, I mean,
taking advantage of a little old lady?

52:58.720 --> 53:01.014
You are some piece of work.

53:02.474 --> 53:04.226
I'm hungry, where the hell's the kitchen?

53:05.394 --> 53:06.228
In the back.

53:06.854 --> 53:09.481
I hope you like Red Vines and Kit Kats.

53:09.565 --> 53:10.858
Yeah, whatever.

53:11.608 --> 53:13.861
No funny business, I'll be right back.

53:14.820 --> 53:16.154
Can you bring me back a Fresca?

53:19.491 --> 53:20.325
Well, there.

53:30.711 --> 53:31.545
Fuck.

53:36.592 --> 53:37.509
Shit.

53:52.232 --> 53:53.066
Fuck.

53:53.150 --> 53:55.861
Fats! They're trying to assassinate me!

54:01.825 --> 54:02.951
Found another tool.

54:06.413 --> 54:09.249
Wild guess.
You're not the maintenance guy.

54:09.333 --> 54:10.834
Gold star for you.

54:10.918 --> 54:12.419
My dad texted you.

54:13.462 --> 54:14.630
Said he was gonna kill you?

54:16.048 --> 54:18.050
You didn't text back, that's rude.

54:18.884 --> 54:22.304
-Now you're running off on him?
-Is it too late to text him back now?

54:22.804 --> 54:23.931
Oh, yeah, come on.

54:24.014 --> 54:24.973
-Okay.
-U-turn.

54:25.057 --> 54:27.768
I can hit him back right now.
I'll hit him back right now.

54:28.352 --> 54:33.065
I'll send like funny emojis,
I got a few gifs.

54:33.148 --> 54:35.400
-Is it gifs or is it jifs?
-The time for that is gone.

54:40.489 --> 54:42.866
Now, you shouldn't
have run off like that, Kasey.

54:42.950 --> 54:45.202
Just when I was warming up to you.

54:46.119 --> 54:47.412
I see you met my son.

54:47.496 --> 54:48.330
Yeah.

54:48.830 --> 54:52.251
You said he can get a job here.
Remember that, Phil French?

54:53.335 --> 54:54.169
Right.

54:54.795 --> 54:56.755
I say we go big on this one, Dad.

54:57.548 --> 55:01.552
Let's take him to the boat.
Gut him like a fish, dump him in the bay.

55:02.052 --> 55:03.262
He's a telemarketer.

55:04.096 --> 55:06.348
Yeah, maybe that's where we end up at.

55:07.182 --> 55:08.016
I don't know.

55:10.143 --> 55:12.938
I say we give him
one last chance at redemption.

55:14.022 --> 55:15.566
Redemption?

55:15.649 --> 55:18.861
Yes, redemption.
To show us he's learned his lesson.

55:18.944 --> 55:21.864
Now, that sounds like
a get out of jail free card.

55:21.947 --> 55:24.992
Where was my redemption last month
when I was locked up in county?

55:25.075 --> 55:27.327
Remember, parole violation?
You wouldn't bail me out!

55:27.411 --> 55:29.246
No, no, no!

55:29.329 --> 55:32.332
You needed to be taught a lesson,
just like Kasey,

55:32.416 --> 55:34.918
and that's what we call deterrence theory.

55:35.878 --> 55:40.924
Fear of extreme measures taken to prevent
the reoccurrence of a particular offence.

55:41.008 --> 55:43.635
But if we kill him now,

55:44.178 --> 55:46.555
wouldn't that prevent
a recurrence of an offence?

55:48.849 --> 55:52.519
Well, yes it would,
but if we take his life,

55:52.603 --> 55:54.688
I want to be sure we had no choice.

55:55.314 --> 55:57.441
Okay, I'm so sorry about this,

55:57.524 --> 56:00.861
I hate to interrupt such a strong
and warm family moment.

56:00.944 --> 56:03.363
However, Dean, if you kill me,

56:03.447 --> 56:06.033
that is in direct violation
of your parole.

56:06.700 --> 56:10.245
-You saying you gonna snitch me out?
-Man, I can't snitch if I'm dead.

56:10.329 --> 56:12.706
-Now, son, son, son.
-Okay.

56:13.790 --> 56:14.958
What'd you do that for?

56:15.042 --> 56:18.128
You're a fucking hothead
with nothing but bricks for brains.

56:18.212 --> 56:19.755
That's how you got caught.

56:19.838 --> 56:21.757
I got caught
because of that bitch ass snitch!

56:21.840 --> 56:23.759
A snitch you aligned yourself with--

56:23.842 --> 56:26.553
Yeah, I aligned this
to his fucking dome, bam!

56:28.347 --> 56:30.390
-Allegedly.
-I didn't hear nothing.

56:30.474 --> 56:32.100
-Hold the phone.
-That's right.

56:32.184 --> 56:33.769
What? What?

56:33.852 --> 56:36.188
What's this here, on the Face what's its?

56:36.271 --> 56:38.649
-What is it? The Face what's it?
-Who's calling you?

56:45.656 --> 56:47.699
Yo, what's up bitches?

56:52.829 --> 56:53.664
Drunkards.

56:54.373 --> 56:56.083
-Drunkards.
-And naked womens.

56:56.166 --> 56:57.751
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

56:57.835 --> 56:59.878
-That's a labia, right there.
-Where are you?

56:59.962 --> 57:01.338
Yeah, that's definitely a labia.

57:01.421 --> 57:04.424
-Barry wants an encore!
-Oh, no.

57:05.759 --> 57:07.553
I'm practically engaged.

57:07.636 --> 57:11.723
He leads a Sunday School choir
when he's not at the strip club

57:11.807 --> 57:13.517
and slapping them cheeks.

57:13.600 --> 57:15.686
Come back when you're practically married.

57:17.771 --> 57:19.731
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

57:20.566 --> 57:22.025
That brings back some memories.

57:22.109 --> 57:24.570
Yeah, you mean the time you was banned?

57:24.653 --> 57:27.739
Come on, like I'm the first guy to use
a counterfeit 20 for a lap dance?

57:27.823 --> 57:29.616
That's actually pretty genius.

57:29.700 --> 57:31.743
-Yeah, you like that?
-Enough!

57:32.870 --> 57:35.664
Keep your eye on him,
my blood sugar's going to shit.

57:35.747 --> 57:36.582
Pretty good.

57:38.083 --> 57:41.753
Let me ask you. Are you up to speed
with what your dad's doing?

57:41.837 --> 57:43.297
-Totally.
-Really?

57:43.380 --> 57:46.383
Because all of this for a damn apology
seems a bit much, right?

57:46.466 --> 57:48.510
-I can hear you.
-Shit.

57:48.594 --> 57:50.095
I suggest you make calls.

57:51.847 --> 57:54.099
-Dad, how long am I supposed to give him?
-30 minutes!

57:55.809 --> 57:56.977
So better start dialling.

57:57.644 --> 58:00.314
My hands are tied, literally, so...

58:03.233 --> 58:04.193
Just one hand.

58:04.276 --> 58:07.988
-Don't try anything.
-I won't, I just... Come on.

58:09.072 --> 58:09.907
All right. Jesus.

58:10.699 --> 58:11.783
Son of a bitch.

58:12.743 --> 58:14.953
Okay, now cut the other one loose.

58:15.037 --> 58:17.581
-No? All right, that's fair.
-You think I'm stupid?

58:18.373 --> 58:19.458
Is that a trick question?

58:23.629 --> 58:25.172
I'm so-- It's really hard.

58:25.672 --> 58:28.425
-As you can see, this is such...
-Yeah, you have to figure it out.

58:30.385 --> 58:31.929
You're supposed to be good at this.

58:32.012 --> 58:33.639
There we go, let me just...

58:33.722 --> 58:36.642
-There you go, perfect.
-You're making this complicated for us.

58:36.725 --> 58:38.936
-You look good though.
-Thank you.

58:39.603 --> 58:42.105
That gun is making me
very nervous, man, I'm just saying.

58:44.274 --> 58:45.651
-Dial faster. Go.
-Okay.

58:57.496 --> 58:59.998
My pops really knows how to hold a grudge.

59:00.082 --> 59:01.291
I'm right there with you.

59:01.375 --> 59:04.545
-I survived my dad, and phew, yeah.
-He a hard ass?

59:04.628 --> 59:06.171
Oh, you have no idea.

59:06.255 --> 59:10.676
You know, he started out as a prosecutor,
and now he's a judge, you know.

59:10.759 --> 59:13.303
If I even blink in the wrong direction,
I'm sweating bullets.

59:13.387 --> 59:15.013
-No shit?
-No shit.

59:15.097 --> 59:16.932
And he wants you
to follow in his footsteps?

59:17.558 --> 59:19.560
Well, I don't think
I'd do too well in court.

59:20.477 --> 59:21.478
Neither would I.

59:23.689 --> 59:24.898
Yeah, I didn't.

59:24.982 --> 59:27.484
-I know. You've made some mistakes.
-Yeah.

59:27.568 --> 59:29.528
-Just a couple.
-Yeah.

59:29.611 --> 59:32.281
You know, for me,
telemarketing is just a job.

59:32.364 --> 59:36.618
I'm good at it, so... Law school
didn't work out, and now here I am.

59:37.244 --> 59:38.829
You know, look, I get it.

59:39.621 --> 59:42.875
You got a job to do here.
So I'm willing to bet

59:42.958 --> 59:49.381
that we can overlook all of your
past transgressions, all the felonies,

59:49.464 --> 59:50.966
the murders,

59:51.049 --> 59:55.220
the rapes probably I'm assuming,
the kidnaps, things like that.

59:55.304 --> 59:57.181
-You know what I'm saying?
-I don't know.

59:57.264 --> 1:00:00.100
Yeah, me either.
Hell, you can be an axe murderer.

1:00:00.184 --> 1:00:02.561
As long as you can sell, you're hired.

1:00:02.644 --> 1:00:05.606
Shit, I'll help you hide the axe.
What axe?

1:00:06.398 --> 1:00:08.400
I know. I ain't seen shit.

1:00:08.483 --> 1:00:09.860
You are good.

1:00:11.403 --> 1:00:12.613
And I'm no salesman.

1:00:13.405 --> 1:00:15.949
You sure ain't the maintenance,
but you could've fooled me.

1:00:17.159 --> 1:00:18.660
I hate telemarketers.

1:00:19.286 --> 1:00:21.246
-I want to kill telemarketers.
-Is that right?

1:00:21.747 --> 1:00:24.958
If I was a telemarketer,
I'd have to kill myself.

1:00:25.542 --> 1:00:28.337
And I don't want to kill myself. Not yet.

1:00:29.838 --> 1:00:31.048
When the time comes.

1:00:31.882 --> 1:00:34.259
-You'll be ready. Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:00:44.645 --> 1:00:47.648
You know I was this close to becoming
top salesman of the month tonight?

1:00:47.731 --> 1:00:48.565
This close.

1:00:48.649 --> 1:00:51.693
And I was gonna take
my girl out and celebrate,

1:00:51.777 --> 1:00:55.572
and pretend to like salmon
as much as I like steak,

1:00:55.656 --> 1:00:58.158
and she would call me out
because she's the only one

1:00:58.242 --> 1:01:00.244
that can see through my bullshit.

1:01:01.495 --> 1:01:05.415
Then we'd laugh, and then I'd propose.

1:01:07.459 --> 1:01:08.377
Does she know?

1:01:09.920 --> 1:01:13.632
Kasey, if you just told my dad the truth,
he would've bought the stupid triple play.

1:01:14.258 --> 1:01:15.759
He's a romantic at heart.

1:01:22.766 --> 1:01:23.934
He would've understood.

1:01:24.017 --> 1:01:26.854
She would've gotten that ring,
you would've gotten that bonus,

1:01:26.937 --> 1:01:29.898
and dad would've cancelled after a month,
so everybody would've won.

1:01:31.984 --> 1:01:33.026
Woulda, shoulda, coulda.

1:01:35.237 --> 1:01:36.572
You got a picture of that lady?

1:01:37.781 --> 1:01:39.408
Yeah, actually on my phone.

1:01:40.784 --> 1:01:42.244
-Of course.
-Yeah.

1:01:43.036 --> 1:01:45.247
-You better do that.
-Be careful, now.

1:01:45.873 --> 1:01:48.959
One look at her, premature ejaculation.

1:01:49.042 --> 1:01:51.461
-It happens to me all the time.
-Let's put it to the test.

1:01:52.129 --> 1:01:53.630
Oh, Kasey.

1:01:54.965 --> 1:01:56.842
-She's a hottie.
-Yes, sir.

1:01:56.925 --> 1:01:59.678
-You need a towel?
-Yeah, in a couple minutes.

1:02:01.430 --> 1:02:02.514
You love her?

1:02:03.182 --> 1:02:04.308
More than anything.

1:02:05.267 --> 1:02:06.101
You know what?

1:02:07.728 --> 1:02:11.148
I'm gonna show this to my dad,
and talk to him about this.

1:02:11.231 --> 1:02:12.524
You serious?

1:02:12.608 --> 1:02:13.942
Yeah, he loved my mom.

1:02:14.526 --> 1:02:16.028
He might understand this.

1:02:16.111 --> 1:02:18.780
-Fuck, man, that would be great.
-Your little love story.

1:02:18.864 --> 1:02:20.449
-Oh, come on. This is great.
-Yeah.

1:02:20.532 --> 1:02:21.366
Great, yeah.

1:02:23.076 --> 1:02:25.662
Just gotta promise me one thing.
Don't try and escape.

1:02:25.746 --> 1:02:26.997
Really?

1:02:29.249 --> 1:02:31.668
How about this.
There's a headset, right over there.

1:02:32.836 --> 1:02:35.506
Grab that, I'll still make calls,
you can listen the whole time.

1:02:35.589 --> 1:02:37.132
-This one?
-That right there.

1:02:37.216 --> 1:02:39.384
That's the only one there,
so it had to be that one.

1:02:41.220 --> 1:02:44.806
Oh, my God.
When did Superman become a telemarketer?

1:02:44.890 --> 1:02:46.433
Damn it, you look natural.

1:02:47.142 --> 1:02:48.143
You look good.

1:02:48.227 --> 1:02:49.561
-Right.
-This is your desk here.

1:02:49.645 --> 1:02:51.730
-I'm gonna go talk to my dad.
-Talk to your daddy.

1:02:52.773 --> 1:02:53.941
Talk to that motherfucker.

1:02:54.024 --> 1:02:56.485
Fuck being a telemarketer,
you're about to be a model, huh?

1:02:57.528 --> 1:02:58.362
Pops.

1:02:59.655 --> 1:03:00.572
Check this out.

1:03:01.281 --> 1:03:02.241
That's his girlfriend.

1:03:02.741 --> 1:03:04.743
What are you doing
with his goddamn phone?

1:03:04.826 --> 1:03:05.869
He gave it to me.

1:03:10.499 --> 1:03:11.542
Looking all good.

1:03:12.334 --> 1:03:16.505
I don't know who I like more,
my girl or you, you pretty motherfucker.

1:03:18.006 --> 1:03:20.759
Blue eyes, looking all coloniser and shit.

1:03:21.844 --> 1:03:23.053
Oh, shit.

1:03:27.015 --> 1:03:28.141
Yeah, there's more.

1:03:29.726 --> 1:03:30.561
Hold on.

1:03:31.937 --> 1:03:32.896
-Hey!
-Yeah?

1:03:32.980 --> 1:03:34.189
-Keep dialling!
-Yeah!

1:03:34.273 --> 1:03:36.358
-Work the phones, Kasey!
-Gotcha!

1:03:37.192 --> 1:03:39.987
Just out here trying to save my life, man!

1:03:40.070 --> 1:03:43.574
Y'all know how it is.
It's a Thursday for y'all, you know.

1:03:49.663 --> 1:03:51.707
-Hello?
-Good evening, Mr. Wilson.

1:03:52.332 --> 1:03:53.166
Who is this?

1:03:54.626 --> 1:03:58.964
Sir, you don't know me,
but I work for TeleWin.

1:03:59.047 --> 1:04:00.424
Are you a telemarketer?

1:04:00.966 --> 1:04:02.009
Yes, sir, I am.

1:04:02.593 --> 1:04:06.263
I am. But, I know it's late,
but please don't hang up.

1:04:06.346 --> 1:04:09.057
Now first, I just want to say I'm sorry

1:04:09.141 --> 1:04:12.978
for my conduct
on behalf of all the telemarketers.

1:04:13.061 --> 1:04:14.521
I might get a photo.

1:04:17.482 --> 1:04:20.068
-Mr. Wilson?
-Is this some kind of a joke?

1:04:20.694 --> 1:04:22.779
No, sir, I assure you, this is no joke.

1:04:22.863 --> 1:04:25.073
In fact, I'm not trying
to sell you anything.

1:04:25.741 --> 1:04:27.826
-Get one with me in it.
-Okay, yeah.

1:04:29.494 --> 1:04:32.247
Sir, I've been a shit person, okay?

1:04:32.331 --> 1:04:36.335
Now, I ask that you
please accept my apology.

1:04:37.044 --> 1:04:37.878
Please.

1:04:37.961 --> 1:04:40.589
I swear, if I ever dropped
a fake 20 on a lap dance with her,

1:04:40.672 --> 1:04:43.509
you have permission to shoot me. What?

1:04:44.468 --> 1:04:46.512
You shouldn't be
dropping fake 20s on no one.

1:04:46.595 --> 1:04:48.096
You gotta be shitting me.

1:04:48.180 --> 1:04:49.848
No, sir, I'm not shitting you, I'm not.

1:04:50.641 --> 1:04:51.683
You're not shitting me.

1:04:53.435 --> 1:04:54.686
Okay, I guess.

1:04:54.770 --> 1:04:58.273
Okay? I'm so sorry, sir,
can you please repeat that?

1:04:58.357 --> 1:04:59.816
Are you deaf? I just said okay.

1:04:59.900 --> 1:05:02.903
Yes! Yes, you hear that?

1:05:02.986 --> 1:05:04.404
He said okay!

1:05:04.488 --> 1:05:05.322
He said okay!

1:05:05.405 --> 1:05:06.490
Fuck, yes, sir.

1:05:06.573 --> 1:05:09.117
-What the hell is going on here?
-Thank you.

1:05:09.201 --> 1:05:10.410
God bless you, sir.

1:05:10.494 --> 1:05:12.538
God bless your kids,
God bless your grandkids.

1:05:12.621 --> 1:05:16.333
Even if they have fucking weird names
like Sunflower and Woody,

1:05:16.416 --> 1:05:19.628
or some bullshit like that. Thank you!

1:05:19.711 --> 1:05:20.963
Suck my dick!

1:05:24.341 --> 1:05:27.928
-They don't call me the king for nothing.
-What?

1:05:28.011 --> 1:05:30.973
"What?" The fuck you mean what?

1:05:31.056 --> 1:05:32.349
You were listening.

1:05:33.475 --> 1:05:34.476
I didn't hear anything.

1:05:34.560 --> 1:05:37.521
On the fucking-- I gave you the headset!

1:05:37.604 --> 1:05:39.857
I didn't hear a damn thing!
Are you calling me a liar?

1:05:39.940 --> 1:05:43.068
No, well, fuck it, give it to me.

1:05:43.944 --> 1:05:45.487
What do you mean you didn't hear it?

1:05:48.866 --> 1:05:50.492
You didn't turn it on, man.

1:05:51.493 --> 1:05:52.494
I fucking had it.

1:05:54.872 --> 1:05:57.958
I fucking had it, man! I fucking had it!

1:05:59.126 --> 1:05:59.960
Well...

1:06:00.043 --> 1:06:04.381
I mean, if an apology's made in the forest
and there's no one to hear it,

1:06:04.464 --> 1:06:06.925
-then...
-We're not in the forest, pops.

1:06:07.885 --> 1:06:09.887
I'll explain it to you later, son.

1:06:11.722 --> 1:06:13.265
Go on, do another.

1:06:16.101 --> 1:06:18.770
Oh, now, don't tell me you's a quitter.

1:06:20.564 --> 1:06:24.401
Where's that relentless bravado,
that mighty perseverance?

1:06:25.485 --> 1:06:27.571
I have no idea, man, out to lunch.

1:06:28.488 --> 1:06:29.364
Fucking gone.

1:06:33.035 --> 1:06:34.286
Come on, now.

1:06:34.369 --> 1:06:35.746
Fuck.

1:06:35.829 --> 1:06:37.164
Dean likes you.

1:06:38.498 --> 1:06:40.709
I want you to make a good impression.

1:06:40.792 --> 1:06:42.753
Now, go on, give it another go.

1:06:47.758 --> 1:06:50.010
I'm gonna be paying
for that stripper's dry cleaning.

1:06:50.093 --> 1:06:53.931
And the $150 room bill,
but you know, happens to the best of us.

1:06:56.683 --> 1:06:57.935
What the hell, Kasey?

1:06:58.018 --> 1:07:02.231
What in the H-E double hockey sticks
are you still doing here, buddy?

1:07:02.314 --> 1:07:03.398
Barry, Christine.

1:07:04.024 --> 1:07:06.985
It's so good to see you both. What's up?

1:07:07.069 --> 1:07:12.407
What's up is,
I met this sweet little tenderoni outside.

1:07:13.992 --> 1:07:15.077
At the strip club?

1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:16.662
-Yeah.
-No.

1:07:16.745 --> 1:07:17.663
Outside.

1:07:18.705 --> 1:07:20.457
You bailed on dinner, and didn't text me.

1:07:20.541 --> 1:07:21.667
It's not like you.

1:07:21.750 --> 1:07:24.878
Oh, you know,
I've just kind of been tied up.

1:07:24.962 --> 1:07:29.967
Oh, well, I would say you left her hanging
like an iguana in the Sahara Desert.

1:07:30.050 --> 1:07:30.884
No.

1:07:31.468 --> 1:07:34.680
Okay, well, you're not dead or cheating.

1:07:34.763 --> 1:07:36.890
So, what's up?

1:07:39.601 --> 1:07:43.438
Barry, man, what are you doing here?
You should probably go.

1:07:46.275 --> 1:07:49.236
-I want you to have this.
-Barry, come on, bro.

1:07:49.319 --> 1:07:50.904
-Barry.
-No, no, listen.

1:07:51.655 --> 1:07:53.407
It's only right, okay?

1:07:53.490 --> 1:07:55.617
I came all the way here,

1:07:55.701 --> 1:07:57.870
and I was gonna put
a nice little sticky note on it.

1:08:00.497 --> 1:08:04.918
But here you are. So, I mean, I guess
the surprise factor is kind of kaput.

1:08:05.002 --> 1:08:08.714
Yeah, I guess you can say
I'm done with surprises for tonight.

1:08:08.797 --> 1:08:10.883
-Aren't we all?
-Babe, I messed up.

1:08:10.966 --> 1:08:13.135
I came to work today,
I'll catch up on some sales,

1:08:13.218 --> 1:08:15.888
and then I guess
I got caught up, I messed up.

1:08:15.971 --> 1:08:16.971
As usual.

1:08:19.015 --> 1:08:20.475
Baby, you should go.

1:08:20.559 --> 1:08:24.270
You know, this ain't for me anymore,
I'm an asshole, so...

1:08:24.354 --> 1:08:25.606
No, you're not an asshole.

1:08:25.689 --> 1:08:28.317
You treat everything in your life
like it's a sale to be made,

1:08:28.399 --> 1:08:32.738
which is really fucking annoying.
But you always call, okay?

1:08:32.821 --> 1:08:35.157
That's what I love about you,
you always call.

1:08:48.002 --> 1:08:52.466
Okay, we're gonna go. Yeah.

1:08:54.051 --> 1:08:56.178
-No. Barry, let's go.
-Wait, no.

1:08:56.261 --> 1:08:57.845
I want to leave this for the guru.

1:08:57.930 --> 1:09:00.015
Barry, we need to go. Barry!

1:09:00.098 --> 1:09:03.018
Hey. Hey, don't you
fucking touch her, man!

1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:05.062
-Oh, my God!
-Hey!

1:09:07.064 --> 1:09:10.234
Asa. Hey, hey.
This is going way too far, man.

1:09:10.317 --> 1:09:14.279
Oh, says the man who spews bullshit
all day to innocent people.

1:09:14.363 --> 1:09:17.991
The man who pretends to be my dead friend
in order to sell a triple play!

1:09:18.075 --> 1:09:20.202
Yeah, sure, Asa.

1:09:20.285 --> 1:09:24.206
I pretended to be
your dead friend to make a sale.

1:09:25.624 --> 1:09:27.125
Have you never been lied to before?

1:09:28.377 --> 1:09:29.670
Let me ask you something, Asa.

1:09:29.752 --> 1:09:32.840
You remember watching
TV commercials as a kid, right?

1:09:33.631 --> 1:09:37.301
You don't think they lied
to get you to buy the toy you wanted?

1:09:38.428 --> 1:09:41.430
You get home,
and you get your Rock'em Sock'em Robot

1:09:41.515 --> 1:09:43.100
or whatever it is, fresh out the box.

1:09:43.183 --> 1:09:45.727
And you look at it,
and it don't quite look,

1:09:45.810 --> 1:09:49.564
or feel, or work the way it does on TV.

1:09:51.066 --> 1:09:53.694
I'm pretty sure you didn't go
to Mattel headquarters with a .44

1:09:53.777 --> 1:09:55.404
and light up the customer service rep.

1:09:56.113 --> 1:09:57.990
How about a little perspective here, Asa?

1:09:58.615 --> 1:10:01.994
This is the free market at work, man!
This is what our country was founded on!

1:10:02.536 --> 1:10:05.455
-Damn it, this is America!
-Sit the fuck down.

1:10:08.542 --> 1:10:11.879
Just so I'm clear,
this is over some silly sales call?

1:10:11.962 --> 1:10:15.132
-Shut up.
-A silly sales call?

1:10:16.550 --> 1:10:17.718
I don't think so.

1:10:18.427 --> 1:10:20.470
I think we have some idea, Asa.

1:10:20.554 --> 1:10:22.848
Your wife used to get
called by telemarketers,

1:10:22.931 --> 1:10:25.559
and then you two would fight about it,
and it made you mad.

1:10:29.146 --> 1:10:30.981
My wife died because of it.

1:10:33.567 --> 1:10:34.568
I told her...

1:10:36.486 --> 1:10:38.989
Don't ever talk and drive.
But she wouldn't listen.

1:10:39.740 --> 1:10:43.452
The last call she ever took
was from one of you guys.

1:10:45.329 --> 1:10:47.122
She lost control of the wheel.

1:10:48.832 --> 1:10:50.584
When some asshole like you...

1:10:52.711 --> 1:10:55.005
was selling her car insurance!

1:10:57.758 --> 1:11:02.346
I asked the FDC
to put me on the do not call list

1:11:02.429 --> 1:11:03.889
out of respect for her memory.

1:11:03.972 --> 1:11:05.557
-Right, son?
-That's right.

1:11:07.809 --> 1:11:09.311
You know, the head of the agency,

1:11:10.604 --> 1:11:14.441
the woman appointed by the goddamn
president of the United States,

1:11:14.525 --> 1:11:16.026
she called me personally.

1:11:17.528 --> 1:11:21.031
Personally, she swore to me,
up and down, left and right.

1:11:22.241 --> 1:11:25.953
"They will never call you again.
Not once, not twice, not ever."

1:11:31.166 --> 1:11:32.876
Guess I shoulda known better.

1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:34.753
Shouldn't have used
that DNC list, asshole.

1:11:40.133 --> 1:11:40.968
Dang it.

1:11:42.344 --> 1:11:44.054
Must've dozed off there.

1:11:44.137 --> 1:11:45.931
Oh, my God, I've never had to shit so bad.

1:11:50.727 --> 1:11:52.604
Wait. Did I miss something?

1:11:53.981 --> 1:11:57.568
-Quite a lot. Join our discussion.
-What's going on?

1:11:59.611 --> 1:12:00.988
You two work together, right?

1:12:01.947 --> 1:12:03.574
-Yeah.
-Know why he's here?

1:12:05.701 --> 1:12:08.495
I figured he stayed behind
to try to make another call.

1:12:08.579 --> 1:12:09.788
And if he made it,

1:12:09.872 --> 1:12:13.041
he would report it
to corporate claiming...

1:12:14.835 --> 1:12:17.421
-he won the $3,000.
-Bingo.

1:12:19.298 --> 1:12:21.091
Must make your blood boil, right?

1:12:22.885 --> 1:12:25.179
-No.
-No?

1:12:26.597 --> 1:12:31.185
No. Actually, I feel relieved.

1:12:32.186 --> 1:12:35.564
I don't feel so bad about
switching his call sheet with Justin's.

1:12:38.108 --> 1:12:39.026
You did what?

1:12:40.319 --> 1:12:42.654
Hold on. So let me get this straight.

1:12:43.530 --> 1:12:46.116
You cheat, and then all this happens?

1:12:47.576 --> 1:12:49.536
You have no idea
what I've been through today!

1:12:49.620 --> 1:12:54.333
Law of the land. Remember?
All I did was level the playing field.

1:12:54.416 --> 1:12:58.795
And you have no position to be
calling anybody in here unethical

1:12:58.879 --> 1:13:02.007
when you're the one who got kicked out
of USC's law school for cheating.

1:13:02.090 --> 1:13:04.301
Oh, my God,
I've been wanting to say that all day.

1:13:05.010 --> 1:13:05.886
Oh, my God.

1:13:06.845 --> 1:13:08.639
Say it isn't so.

1:13:10.057 --> 1:13:11.725
I mean, he's drunk.

1:13:11.808 --> 1:13:13.435
I know all about it, okay?

1:13:13.519 --> 1:13:16.647
Your assistant dean, she told me about it.
We're in the same church choir.

1:13:16.730 --> 1:13:18.565
And the church says amen.

1:13:18.649 --> 1:13:22.194
-You told me you dropped out.
-Baby, I'm-- Thank you.

1:13:22.986 --> 1:13:24.279
Thank you very much, Barry.

1:13:25.322 --> 1:13:27.741
Kasey, your buddy just sold you out.

1:13:29.326 --> 1:13:31.245
-Hey, pops.
-Yeah, son?

1:13:31.328 --> 1:13:33.872
What were you telling me about deterrence?

1:13:33.956 --> 1:13:35.541
Deterrence theory.

1:13:35.624 --> 1:13:37.042
Deterrence theory, yeah.

1:13:38.418 --> 1:13:41.505
Barry, I learned something today.

1:13:41.588 --> 1:13:46.176
The use of extreme actions to prevent
the reoccurrence of a specific action.

1:13:46.260 --> 1:13:48.262
-Spot-on, son.
-Yeah.

1:13:48.762 --> 1:13:52.099
Kasey, do you know the one thing
I detest more than telemarketers?

1:13:53.934 --> 1:13:54.768
A snitch?

1:13:56.103 --> 1:13:57.396
Gold star for you.

1:13:59.773 --> 1:14:00.983
Fuck me!

1:14:01.066 --> 1:14:02.609
What the fuck, man!

1:14:03.318 --> 1:14:04.570
Oh, my God!

1:14:05.612 --> 1:14:08.240
You know, that's a clean hole.

1:14:10.951 --> 1:14:13.078
Would you go clean that up for us?

1:14:13.996 --> 1:14:15.122
-Me?
-Yes, please.

1:14:16.540 --> 1:14:18.584
Go on over. Go on, clean it up.

1:14:21.753 --> 1:14:23.046
Grab the...

1:14:23.964 --> 1:14:24.965
Yeah, grab the...

1:14:30.971 --> 1:14:32.431
How long do you think he's got?

1:14:32.514 --> 1:14:36.560
I don't know. I mean, I'm trying to be
a psychologist, not a doctor.

1:14:36.643 --> 1:14:40.189
-Put your hands on it. Yeah.
-Isn't this perfect?

1:14:40.272 --> 1:14:43.358
Now, his life is in your hands.

1:14:43.442 --> 1:14:46.695
Okay, look,
just let Barry and Christine go. Okay?

1:14:47.821 --> 1:14:50.532
You can lock me in your basement,
give me your phone.

1:14:50.616 --> 1:14:53.285
I'll make as many calls as you want,
apologise to as many people

1:14:53.368 --> 1:14:57.664
-as you want for the rest of my life.
-Now, that would be going too far.

1:14:57.748 --> 1:15:02.044
I mean, plus the train set's down there,
and Dean's man cave.

1:15:02.127 --> 1:15:05.422
-Yeah.
-All we need is one apology accepted.

1:15:06.131 --> 1:15:09.051
Here, now, for all to hear. Now, come on.

1:15:10.093 --> 1:15:13.430
Go on, just get your do not call list,

1:15:13.514 --> 1:15:18.602
and you best get to dialling
before you all get clocked out.

1:15:19.228 --> 1:15:20.062
Okay.

1:15:20.562 --> 1:15:23.482
Seeing as how this
could potentially be my very last call...

1:15:25.317 --> 1:15:27.986
-I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.
-No.

1:15:28.070 --> 1:15:31.865
Hey, now.
It's my pre last call ritual, you know.

1:15:32.491 --> 1:15:34.493
Every time I make my final call,

1:15:35.035 --> 1:15:40.457
I need to have one cup of coffee
from my signature toilet bowl mug.

1:15:41.333 --> 1:15:43.001
Ain't that right, rookie?

1:15:43.085 --> 1:15:45.087
Yeah, as long as I've been here.

1:15:45.629 --> 1:15:47.005
-Oh, Christ.
-Stop.

1:15:47.506 --> 1:15:48.340
Jesus Christ.

1:15:48.423 --> 1:15:49.258
Yeah.

1:15:51.009 --> 1:15:52.803
Why don't you get the fucking coffee?

1:15:54.847 --> 1:15:57.558
You don't strike me as someone
who would drink out of the toilet.

1:15:58.267 --> 1:16:00.435
I mean, he's full of shit, so...

1:16:00.519 --> 1:16:03.647
You know, I tried it once,
sold a triple play,

1:16:03.730 --> 1:16:05.607
so I'm not one to argue with success.

1:16:05.691 --> 1:16:09.987
Here's your goddamn coffee.
Go ahead, take your ritualistic sip.

1:16:12.739 --> 1:16:15.909
This here is your last call.

1:16:17.619 --> 1:16:21.665
If this doesn't work, you're going
on a boat ride with me and Dean.

1:16:23.333 --> 1:16:24.168
Dial.

1:16:42.436 --> 1:16:43.270
Yes?

1:16:44.688 --> 1:16:46.064
Hello, sir, it's Kasey.

1:16:48.358 --> 1:16:49.234
Yes, Kasey?

1:16:49.902 --> 1:16:52.321
It's late, I'm surprised you're still up.

1:16:53.739 --> 1:16:56.450
-Just reading some motions.
-Of course you are.

1:16:58.744 --> 1:16:59.745
Did you need something?

1:17:02.289 --> 1:17:03.415
Yeah, I was just...

1:17:05.417 --> 1:17:06.752
You know, I've been...

1:17:08.045 --> 1:17:10.547
just been meaning
to talk to you, you know.

1:17:11.882 --> 1:17:13.884
I already got Internet, thank you.

1:17:14.510 --> 1:17:16.011
Okay, yeah, I guess I deserve that.

1:17:16.678 --> 1:17:20.641
But no, there's something I've been
meaning to speak with you about.

1:17:22.059 --> 1:17:23.602
I got cable and phone too.

1:17:23.685 --> 1:17:26.730
I'm not... Look, sir, I'm not selling.

1:17:27.272 --> 1:17:28.815
I didn't know that was possible.

1:17:28.899 --> 1:17:33.654
Sir, please, I just wanted to apologise.

1:17:35.197 --> 1:17:37.741
-I didn't know that was possible either.
-Come on.

1:17:39.493 --> 1:17:40.994
Go on, I'm listening.

1:17:41.078 --> 1:17:42.621
I just wanted to say...

1:17:46.166 --> 1:17:47.042
I'm sorry.

1:17:48.877 --> 1:17:51.296
I'm sorry for this dirty business I'm in.

1:17:52.965 --> 1:17:55.175
And the pain it must cause people.

1:17:57.135 --> 1:17:58.136
And that includes you.

1:17:59.972 --> 1:18:01.682
I guess when you think about it, I just,

1:18:02.391 --> 1:18:04.226
was never really good
at anything, you know?

1:18:05.060 --> 1:18:08.689
Sports, school, none of it.

1:18:10.941 --> 1:18:12.234
But here, I'm good.

1:18:13.277 --> 1:18:14.695
I'm real good, you know?

1:18:15.946 --> 1:18:17.197
I can do what I want,

1:18:17.823 --> 1:18:20.409
can come and go as I please,
and nobody calls me out on it.

1:18:21.702 --> 1:18:23.287
Almost no one.

1:18:24.538 --> 1:18:26.498
Compared to law school,
this place is amazing.

1:18:27.165 --> 1:18:28.375
You see, in class...

1:18:29.501 --> 1:18:32.379
In class I would just lie
and cheat my way through everything.

1:18:32.462 --> 1:18:36.508
And it worked for a little while,
but then you get kicked out.

1:18:38.468 --> 1:18:39.970
And then you end up here.

1:18:42.556 --> 1:18:46.351
You see, here I can meet people,

1:18:47.811 --> 1:18:48.979
I get to know them,

1:18:50.522 --> 1:18:52.900
and right when I got them
where I want them, I sell them.

1:18:53.567 --> 1:18:55.736
And I sell them, and I sell them.

1:18:56.320 --> 1:18:57.988
The bullshit works.

1:18:58.071 --> 1:19:01.074
It works here.
In fact, they encourage it, you know?

1:19:01.158 --> 1:19:02.868
So much so that corporate, you know,

1:19:02.951 --> 1:19:05.120
corporate is starting
to call it the Kasey Method.

1:19:05.204 --> 1:19:06.205
Can you believe that?

1:19:06.288 --> 1:19:09.082
They named something after me,
the Kasey Method.

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:13.962
I lie and I cheat people,
and they pat me on the back for it.

1:19:15.255 --> 1:19:17.049
I don't like me because of it.

1:19:19.635 --> 1:19:21.553
And I know
I'm not the man you want me to be,

1:19:22.763 --> 1:19:24.890
I didn't go down the path
you wanted me to go down.

1:19:29.061 --> 1:19:30.354
For that, I'm sorry.

1:19:31.230 --> 1:19:33.190
I truly am, I am very sorry.

1:19:37.319 --> 1:19:38.153
So...

1:19:40.030 --> 1:19:40.989
what do you say?

1:19:43.325 --> 1:19:46.078
Do you accept my apology, Dad?

1:19:51.250 --> 1:19:54.795
Oh, and there's somebody
I would really like for you to meet.

1:19:54.878 --> 1:19:57.714
So, depending on your answer,
I think we should all hang out.

1:19:57.798 --> 1:19:59.633
I think you would
really like her, you know?

1:20:05.347 --> 1:20:09.268
You know, son,
I'm really happy you called.

1:20:11.687 --> 1:20:13.105
Of course I forgive you.

1:20:22.614 --> 1:20:23.448
No!

1:20:43.635 --> 1:20:45.762
Baby, call 911. Call 911, right now!

1:20:45.846 --> 1:20:47.472
No!

1:20:47.556 --> 1:20:49.183
I'm not going back to jail!

1:20:50.142 --> 1:20:51.643
Shut up, you goddamn...

1:20:54.062 --> 1:20:56.607
-Thanks for the mug, rookie.
-I try.

1:20:58.400 --> 1:20:59.693
Since we're in apologies mode,

1:20:59.776 --> 1:21:02.029
I'm sorry there's a hole
in your leg right now.

1:21:03.780 --> 1:21:06.116
It's not your fault, it's his.

1:21:07.492 --> 1:21:09.703
Oh, no, please, I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

1:21:11.705 --> 1:21:12.664
Oh, shit!

1:21:14.291 --> 1:21:15.667
Apology accepted.

1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:21.924
Baby, I'm sorry I'm an asshole.
I'm sorry I stood you up, you know?

1:21:22.007 --> 1:21:23.967
-I'm sorry.
-We can do this later.

1:21:24.051 --> 1:21:26.845
Apologies all around.
Everybody gets an apology.

1:21:26.929 --> 1:21:30.474
I too am sorry for not
shooting you in the goddamn head

1:21:30.557 --> 1:21:33.018
when I first laid eyes on you.

1:21:37.397 --> 1:21:38.273
Hold this.

1:21:41.693 --> 1:21:42.528
Asa.

1:21:43.987 --> 1:21:45.572
I know you got a raw deal.

1:21:46.448 --> 1:21:47.699
Losing the love of your life,

1:21:48.450 --> 1:21:51.662
and how that must be
affecting you and Dean.

1:21:53.247 --> 1:21:55.791
I'm not gonna pretend to imagine
what that must feel like.

1:21:55.874 --> 1:21:57.918
And if I could go back in time,

1:21:58.001 --> 1:22:00.546
I would really change
your circumstance, man, I really would.

1:22:02.381 --> 1:22:04.508
I'm sad about your wife, Asa,

1:22:04.591 --> 1:22:08.804
and the role this fucked-up
telemarketing culture played in it.

1:22:10.848 --> 1:22:13.767
Damn it, Asa, I'm sorry, man. I really am.

1:22:16.144 --> 1:22:17.271
Kasey Miller.

1:22:18.355 --> 1:22:20.357
That's all I ever wanted from you.

1:22:21.483 --> 1:22:26.196
Was for you to take a good,
deep, long look at yourself.

1:22:28.615 --> 1:22:29.950
I know it wasn't easy.

1:22:32.452 --> 1:22:33.453
I'm proud of you.

1:22:35.289 --> 1:22:37.165
I'm gonna accept your apology.

1:22:38.208 --> 1:22:39.042
I do.

1:22:42.004 --> 1:22:44.131
It still wasn't on the phone though.

1:22:45.716 --> 1:22:48.218
-You've got to be kidding me.
-Come on, I'm dying over here.

1:22:48.302 --> 1:22:50.846
-Let's get you taken care of.
-Take this, I don't want this.

1:22:50.929 --> 1:22:51.972
-You sure?
-Yes.

1:22:52.055 --> 1:22:54.725
-Because I can kill them right now.
-What? No.

1:22:54.808 --> 1:22:57.102
I'm just saying,
he's been talking so much shit.

1:23:12.326 --> 1:23:13.285
That's a pretty house.

1:23:15.287 --> 1:23:16.121
Are you okay?

1:23:19.082 --> 1:23:20.459
No, I'm good. I just...

1:23:22.002 --> 1:23:22.836
I just...

1:23:24.713 --> 1:23:26.215
It doesn't feel right, you know?

1:23:27.007 --> 1:23:30.427
-Yeah, but you wanted to do this.
-No, I do, I just...

1:23:32.221 --> 1:23:33.889
I can't help but feel silly.

1:23:36.016 --> 1:23:37.017
But you'll feel better.

1:23:39.269 --> 1:23:41.605
And besides, silly is your middle name.

1:23:41.688 --> 1:23:43.106
Silly is my middle name.

1:23:45.234 --> 1:23:46.151
So wise.

1:23:48.695 --> 1:23:49.696
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1:24:13.345 --> 1:24:14.179
Mrs. Hanks!

1:24:15.180 --> 1:24:16.557
Bring your ass outside!
