<i>Previously on Kyle XY:</i>

00:03.036 --> 00:05.527
- What are you doing?
- I'm keeping a list.

00:05.605 --> 00:07.163
What makes Kyle an alien.

00:07.273 --> 00:09.434
He's this super-brain with amnesia.

00:09.542 --> 00:12.033
He barely knows
what you're saying sometimes,

00:12.112 --> 00:14.342
but does calculus
like it's two plus two.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.939
I'm telling you, Kyle is not human.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.542
- You don't have a belly button?
- No.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.350
- Why not?
- I don't know.

00:22.422 --> 00:25.550
Anyway, I should apologize.

00:25.625 --> 00:28.719
I screw up all the time.
Maybe it's your turn.

00:37.904 --> 00:40.873
- Do they have any suspects?
- No, not yet.

00:40.974 --> 00:44.137
- Does this mean anything to you?
- No.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.235
I think someone's breaking in.

00:46.312 --> 00:48.803
- Tom from our security company.
- Hello, sir.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.841
- You just happened to be driving by?
- Yeah. It's a lucky thing, huh?

02:26.513 --> 02:29.277
Thanks, man.
It's getting pretty wet out there.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.748
You're Kyle, right?
The amnesia guy?

02:34.454 --> 02:35.614
Yeah.

02:36.422 --> 02:40.153
You broke the window at my party.
My dad had an aneurism over that one.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.020
- Sorry.
- He has aneurisms over everything.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.826
So, whatever. It's cool.

02:49.035 --> 02:50.559
You mind?

02:51.437 --> 02:54.804
- You know, Lori's sleeping.
- Well, yeah. It's pretty late.

02:56.543 --> 02:58.704
I need a place to crash.

02:58.778 --> 03:01.838
I didn't think it was too smart
to climb up to her window.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.075
You're bleeding.

03:04.817 --> 03:07.149
Crap. Sorry.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.983
It's OK, but what happened to you?

03:09.088 --> 03:11.318
It's a long story. Too boring.

03:12.458 --> 03:15.950
You got an extra blanket or something?
I'll crash on your floor.

03:22.835 --> 03:25.497
- What is this place?
- My bedroom.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.068
Where's the bed?

03:34.614 --> 03:37.742
- You sleep in a tub?
- Yeah.

03:39.586 --> 03:41.247
Trager said you're a head case.

03:47.694 --> 03:50.390
I mean, but not, like, rudely.

03:51.331 --> 03:52.491
Whatever. It's cool.

03:53.733 --> 03:58.602
- The rain should let up by morning.
- Actually, not until 2:27 tomorrow.

04:01.774 --> 04:03.742
Yeah, whatever.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.735
- Tell me you're joking.
- No. He's in here.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.570
Not good. What are you doing here?

05:09.642 --> 05:11.906
Got in a fight with my dad.
Needed to crash.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.946
If my parents find you, I am dead.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.811
That is nothing compared
to what my dad'll do to you.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.316
Relax, Trager.

05:18.384 --> 05:21.148
They will never believe
that you weren't in my room.

05:21.254 --> 05:24.883
The one time I'm not actually
doing anything wrong.

05:24.957 --> 05:26.481
Today of all days.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.163
What did you do to your head?

05:31.731 --> 05:33.699
Uh, slipped on some wet leaves.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.130
Drink much?

05:37.203 --> 05:39.831
I can sneak out.
They'll never know I was here.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.669
They better not.

05:42.475 --> 05:45.842
Just don't make a sound.

06:03.730 --> 06:06.961
Oh, man.
You're up too early.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.196
I thought I'd have another
half hour to get breakfast ready.

06:10.303 --> 06:13.602
- I'm turning over a new leaf.
- Happy birthday, honey.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.374
Thanks, Mom.

06:16.976 --> 06:20.503
- I love you.
- Oh, I know.

06:22.348 --> 06:24.316
I love you too.

06:31.023 --> 06:32.285
Good morning.

06:34.660 --> 06:38.391
Nice to meet you, Mr. Trager.
I'm Declan McDonough.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.830
I just popped by
to wish Lori a happy birthday.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.028
Declan, huh?
Well, it's nice to finally meet you.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.438
Do I smell pancakes?

06:48.007 --> 06:49.872
What happened to your head?

06:49.942 --> 06:52.877
Went up for a dunk on the court
and landed the wrong way.

06:52.945 --> 06:55.106
- You play ball?
- Shooting guard.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.244
Cool.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.784
- More pancakes?
- Thanks.

07:03.456 --> 07:06.016
You make a great blueberry pancake,
Mrs. Trager.

07:06.993 --> 07:10.326
They're Lori's favorite.
I make them every year to celebrate.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.557
Because we're so happy she was born.

07:12.665 --> 07:15.190
- I'm ignoring you.
- Good move.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.566
If your birthday means
you're a year older,

07:17.637 --> 07:20.265
aren't we celebrating
one year closer to death?

07:20.339 --> 07:24.207
- I guess that's one way to look at it.
- I think I just lost my appetite.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.505
Don't worry, Lori.

07:25.578 --> 07:29.014
The average lifespan
for the American woman is 79.2 years.

07:29.081 --> 07:32.380
If you were Japanese
you would have a few more years,

07:32.452 --> 07:34.283
but it's still not so bad.

07:34.353 --> 07:37.015
Whose idea was it
to let him read the encyclopedia?

07:37.089 --> 07:39.717
Hey, we should bring out
Lori's baby pictures.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.317
Reminisce over the awkward years.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.260
At least I'm out of mine.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.324
<i>Birthdays.</i>

07:47.066 --> 07:48.590
<i>Baby pictures.</i>

07:48.668 --> 07:50.693
<i>Blueberry pancakes.</i>

07:51.537 --> 07:54.700
<i>They were talking about
memories and traditions.</i>

07:54.774 --> 07:56.799
<i>But I had none of my own.</i>

07:56.876 --> 07:58.776
You gonna eat that, or what?

08:00.546 --> 08:02.104
Kyle, everything OK?

08:04.150 --> 08:05.447
I'm fine.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.923
Seems like it will never end,
doesn't it?

08:22.101 --> 08:24.569
- Three more hours.
- You think?

08:26.839 --> 08:28.329
You know.

08:29.575 --> 08:32.942
It's easy to process data
from global weather satellites.

08:33.044 --> 08:35.946
I just can't figure out
why rain triggers nightmares.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.506
- Are you having bad dreams?
- Last night.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.883
- What was it about?
- I'm not sure.

08:41.953 --> 08:43.615
Well, don't dismiss it.

08:43.688 --> 08:46.385
Every piece of information
from your head counts.

08:46.459 --> 08:51.192
And dreams are a reflection
of what's going on in our subconscious.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.630
- Where memories are stored.
- Exactly.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.133
The brain is a powerful tool,
especially yours.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.830
Yet it can't tell me
something simple, my birthday.

08:58.905 --> 09:01.465
That's something
we'll figure out together.

09:15.421 --> 09:18.151
<i>The science of weather
came easily to me.</i>

09:18.224 --> 09:20.886
<i>It was numbers, data and patterns.</i>

09:21.794 --> 09:25.321
<i>What I couldn't figure out,
no matter how hard I tried...</i>

09:26.165 --> 09:28.065
<i>...was me.</i>

09:38.311 --> 09:41.007
Where's Declan?

09:43.015 --> 09:45.245
Geeking out with Josh.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.583
Put a guy in front of a video game
and there goes his personality.

09:48.654 --> 09:53.318
Well, try growing up in the Pink Floyd
era and replace video games with pot.

09:53.392 --> 09:54.950
It's so tedious.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.424
- You're baking?
- I bake.

09:59.498 --> 10:00.931
You make.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.235
It's a special occasion, OK?
Cut me some slack.

10:04.303 --> 10:07.397
OK. I'm just saying,
you don't have to bake a cake for me.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.771
Well, birthdays are all about cake.

10:09.842 --> 10:12.470
I guess I'm just not feeling
the birthday thing.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.172
But you love your birthday.

10:15.414 --> 10:17.109
Not this year.

10:25.024 --> 10:28.983
Kyle's just bummed out 'cause he knows
the aliens are coming back to get him.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.825
It's the rain.
They travel on lightning bolts.

10:31.931 --> 10:34.491
<i>- Like in War of the Worlds.
- Cool it, Josh.</i>

10:34.567 --> 10:36.330
You got a better theory?

10:37.136 --> 10:39.468
Get him...
The ax guy in the corner, get him.

10:39.538 --> 10:42.302
- Oh, great, it's spreading.
- Hey, hon.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.467
Did you know Lori hates her birthday?

10:44.543 --> 10:46.408
Do we still have to suck up to her?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.606
Oh, 'cause you were doing
such a good job.

10:48.681 --> 10:51.946
- 'Cause she's in a fight with Hilary.
- She's in a fight with Hilary?

10:53.319 --> 10:55.412
Hey, Kyle, come in.
We'll play teams.

10:56.789 --> 10:58.518
Kyle, what's wrong?

11:02.428 --> 11:05.295
- Is this from your dream?
- I think it's a memory.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.508
You saw him
in your dream last night?

11:19.578 --> 11:23.207
- Then again earlier, like a flash.
- But you don't recognize his face?

11:23.282 --> 11:26.410
No. He popped into my head.
I checked the weather archives.

11:26.485 --> 11:29.852
The last storm we had was the night
before I woke up in the woods.

11:29.922 --> 11:33.449
- Maybe this is a memory from then.
- It's definitely a possibility.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.586
I'm tired of possibilities.
I need something to be real.

11:36.662 --> 11:38.630
That's the problem with amnesia.

11:38.731 --> 11:41.791
Your mind only unlocks information
when it's ready.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.392
There are other methods.
Hypnosis, drugs...

11:44.470 --> 11:47.735
- You've been studying.
- I need to understand myself.

11:47.807 --> 11:50.776
I get it, Kyle, I do. I promise you,

11:50.876 --> 11:54.209
if I believe there's an alternative
to the "wait and see" method

11:54.280 --> 11:55.338
I'll give it a shot.

11:55.414 --> 11:58.872
But those kinds of aggressive therapies
can work against you.

11:58.951 --> 12:02.079
You just had what may have been
your first memory.

12:02.154 --> 12:05.317
I don't want to risk a set-back.
Can you trust me on this?

12:13.232 --> 12:15.200
The power line's down.

12:51.737 --> 12:53.762
What are you doing?

12:55.674 --> 12:57.039
Tom!

12:58.043 --> 12:59.806
Sorry to startle you, Mr. Trager.

12:59.879 --> 13:02.746
A bunch of houses in the neighborhood
have lost power.

13:02.815 --> 13:06.114
I'm just doing the rounds,
making sure everybody's OK.

13:06.185 --> 13:07.345
I'm glad you're here.

13:07.453 --> 13:11.287
Our foster son drew a picture of someone
staring in at him from the window.

13:11.357 --> 13:15.453
At first we thought it was his
imagination, but now I'm not so sure.

13:20.866 --> 13:24.233
What if it's the same person
that broke in the house last week?

13:24.303 --> 13:26.931
You said something about,
that he drew a picture?

13:27.006 --> 13:29.338
- Yeah.
- I should probably look at that.

13:29.408 --> 13:32.104
- All right, it's inside.
- Yeah, let's do that.

13:44.623 --> 13:46.250
I hear you're anti-birthday.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.156
Word travels fast.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.931
My last birthday, my dad
couldn't be bothered to be in town.

13:58.637 --> 14:00.901
So, I raided the liquor cabinet
in protest.

14:02.341 --> 14:06.300
- At least you got blueberry pancakes.
- Your favorite.

14:06.378 --> 14:09.347
Parents like me.
What can I say?

14:13.252 --> 14:15.584
Seriously, what's your deal?

14:16.755 --> 14:19.815
I'm just feeling particularly friendless
right now.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.487
It makes celebrating
another year of life sort of bleak.

14:23.562 --> 14:27.054
I'm your friend.
Kind of, I think.

14:27.132 --> 14:30.226
Yeah, after you duped me
into losing my virginity?

14:30.302 --> 14:32.167
- I didn't dupe you...
- Please.

14:32.238 --> 14:34.399
Water. Bridge.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.719
So what really happened to your head?

14:51.790 --> 14:54.486
It seems like whoever asks
gets a different story.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.653
I told you, I fell.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.562
Before or after
your fight with your dad?

15:00.366 --> 15:02.061
Can we drop this, please?

15:05.104 --> 15:08.870
You know, my mom's a therapist.
You could...

15:08.974 --> 15:11.841
Trager, it's no big deal. Seriously.

15:11.911 --> 15:15.142
No scandalous family drama.
No horrible tales of abuse.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.747
Let it go. I'm fine.

15:36.368 --> 15:40.805
<i>Door!</i>

15:54.553 --> 15:55.713
Hi.

15:57.589 --> 15:58.920
Hi.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.359
The power's out at my house.
I didn't wanna be home alone,

16:02.428 --> 16:04.953
- so I thought I'd come here.
- Where's Charlie?

16:05.030 --> 16:07.658
- At his house.
- Why didn't you go over there?

16:09.201 --> 16:11.294
I guess I just wanted to come over here.

16:18.677 --> 16:21.111
Josh said you remembered something.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.311
- I still don't know what it means.
- It will come back to you.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.379
I'm beginning to wonder if it will.

16:32.958 --> 16:36.257
I think you should get out of the tub.
You're wallowing.

16:39.531 --> 16:41.624
"To indulge oneself immoderately,

16:41.700 --> 16:43.827
as in, wallowing in self-pity. "

16:47.239 --> 16:51.505
- I'm wallowing.
- Well, it's depressing.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.683
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna wallow with you.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.501
- This is strange.
- Yep.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.234
Well, here it is.

17:29.481 --> 17:33.440
It's... a lot of detail.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.712
Yeah.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.246
- You recognize him?
- No.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.720
No, I never saw him before.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.326
Did Kyle say when he saw him?

17:46.398 --> 17:48.423
No, he was spooked by the whole thing.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.559
- He didn't say much.
- OK.

17:52.771 --> 17:55.137
I'll circulate it
at the security company.

17:55.507 --> 17:58.374
I'll pass it on to the police
and maybe they can ID him.

17:58.444 --> 18:01.072
Great. Thanks.
I really appreciate it.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.205
No problem.
Just doing my job.

18:06.185 --> 18:09.052
- Did you give him the picture?
- Yeah.

18:09.121 --> 18:12.090
Poor Kyle. He was so sure
it was a memory and not a dream.

18:12.157 --> 18:16.389
I wish it was. I don't like the idea
of someone trying to break in.

18:16.462 --> 18:20.558
It's strange that both times somebody
tried to get into Kyle's room.

18:21.467 --> 18:24.231
- Do you ever wonder if Kyle...
- What?

18:25.237 --> 18:27.205
No. It's ridiculous.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.503
After everything we've witnessed,
nothing is ridiculous.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.307
No one's reported him missing.

18:34.379 --> 18:37.507
He's capable of doing things
that no normal child,

18:37.583 --> 18:40.609
or no normal human being,
should be capable of.

18:42.121 --> 18:46.057
I'm not saying that I believe
in Josh's crazy theories, but...

18:46.125 --> 18:47.490
But?

18:48.260 --> 18:50.956
Maybe he's not missing for a reason.

18:51.029 --> 18:55.056
Maybe there's someone out there
that knows exactly where he is.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.760
Maybe they're watching him.

18:58.837 --> 19:01.203
You mean, like little green men?

19:02.574 --> 19:04.599
No, but...

19:04.676 --> 19:07.839
You know, all of this, it's so crazy.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.716
It just kind of makes you wonder.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.968
<i>- Yes?
- We've got a problem.</i>

19:33.205 --> 19:34.968
He's starting to remember.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.183
- Board games?
- Anything's better

19:54.259 --> 19:56.352
than dodging real conversation.

19:56.428 --> 19:58.794
- You went in my room?
- Get over it.

19:58.897 --> 20:01.661
Mystic vision? I don't think so.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.826
Yeah, we don't want to play that.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.734
- What is it?
- It's a Ouija board.

20:06.805 --> 20:10.263
You ask it questions and supposedly
the spirits spell out answers.

20:10.342 --> 20:14.301
When, in reality, it's usually
some idiot moving the pointer around.

20:14.379 --> 20:18.076
We should do something.
This rain's not letting up anytime soon.

20:18.150 --> 20:22.484
Actually, it's letting up in 32 minutes,
according to KZRE Weather here.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.215
Not anymore.
The wind shifted.

20:24.289 --> 20:27.258
- I bet it did.
- Let's play.

20:27.326 --> 20:30.591
- It's totally fake, Kyle.
- I don't care.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.962
No. Seriously, find another game.

20:34.032 --> 20:35.056
Josh.

20:42.274 --> 20:45.038
Looks like the spirits are total pervs.

20:45.110 --> 20:49.444
One word, dude, Internet.

20:49.514 --> 20:51.141
How do we start?

21:13.205 --> 21:15.969
<i>- Yeah?
- I'm hoping you have a plan.</i>

21:19.711 --> 21:21.008
<i>You still there?</i>

21:21.079 --> 21:24.571
I think I know how to stop that family
from asking more questions.

21:24.650 --> 21:25.708
<i>Good.</i>

21:25.784 --> 21:29.743
<i>If his memory's getting any clearer,
the family's gonna become a problem.</i>

21:33.659 --> 21:35.627
I'll take care of it.

21:45.103 --> 21:46.934
OK. I'll go first.

21:48.573 --> 21:52.839
Who is the biggest queen bee bitch
at Beachwood High?

21:56.615 --> 21:58.276
"L"...

22:03.088 --> 22:04.646
"O"...

22:05.557 --> 22:07.252
"R"...
Josh!

22:07.326 --> 22:09.988
What can I say?
The spirits speak the truth.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.586
OK.

22:12.097 --> 22:16.056
My turn. How badly am I
going to destroy Declan's high score

22:16.168 --> 22:18.329
once the electricity comes back on?

22:18.403 --> 22:20.667
No spirit can help you
with that, junior.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.969
- You're toast.
- Can I go next?

22:23.041 --> 22:24.702
Knock yourself out.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.738
When's my birthday?

22:28.847 --> 22:30.781
Kyle, you know this is just a game?

22:30.849 --> 22:32.976
For 12-year-olds.

22:33.051 --> 22:37.351
Hey! If anyone can get a Ouija board
to work, it's him.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.751
Just concentrate, Kyle.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.341
I don't think...

23:05.584 --> 23:07.347
Who's moving the pointer?

23:07.419 --> 23:08.511
Seven...

23:10.288 --> 23:12.153
Eight...

23:18.330 --> 23:20.355
One...

23:20.432 --> 23:23.367
- Two...
- I'm getting freaked out.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.237
Two...

23:32.411 --> 23:33.969
Seven...

23:47.659 --> 23:50.219
Seven, eight, one, two, two, seven.

23:54.065 --> 23:58.729
- What does it mean?
- Seven, eight, one, two, two, seven.

24:00.705 --> 24:04.732
- You had to have been pushing it.
- Spelling out your alien birthday?

24:04.810 --> 24:07.711
- I wasn't.
- You don't think you were.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.747
- I wasn't.
- What is that?

24:10.682 --> 24:14.618
A Kyle file. I've documented every
out-of-the ordinary event and behavior

24:14.686 --> 24:16.313
ever since we got him.

24:17.522 --> 24:20.650
"Made contact

24:21.593 --> 24:25.154
with spirit world. "

24:25.230 --> 24:27.858
Whoa, buddy. It's classified.

24:30.001 --> 24:32.333
This is ridiculous.
He's not an alien.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.167
He's not even a good weatherman.

24:36.107 --> 24:37.472
The rain?

24:37.576 --> 24:38.873
It stopped.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.044
This doesn't make any sense.

24:50.121 --> 24:54.182
Neither do the Chicken Little conspiracy
theories Josh has been spouting.

24:57.696 --> 24:59.527
You guys aren't buying any of this?

24:59.598 --> 25:02.533
Kyle isn't supernatural.
He's just kid with no memory

25:02.601 --> 25:05.570
and annoyingly accurate
knowledge of the encyclopedia.

25:05.637 --> 25:07.867
- You don't know that.
- It's a game.

25:07.939 --> 25:10.100
There's no such thing
as spirits or ghosts.

25:10.208 --> 25:12.972
When you're dead, you're dead.
Buried, rotting.

25:13.078 --> 25:15.706
Declan, shut up.

25:15.780 --> 25:18.214
- No, it's OK.
- No, it's not OK.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.183
Oh, God, your dad...

25:21.586 --> 25:23.053
I'm sorry.

25:23.755 --> 25:26.724
<i>There was a sudden drop
in the barometric pressure,</i>

25:26.825 --> 25:30.192
<i>the crackling rise
of static electricity in the air,</i>

25:30.262 --> 25:32.355
<i>and the subtle smell of ozone.</i>

25:33.532 --> 25:36.228
- Get back inside, now!
- What are you talking about?

25:36.301 --> 25:38.064
Just come on!

25:48.113 --> 25:50.047
- That was weird.
- What was that?

25:50.749 --> 25:53.684
Nothing.
It was nothing.

25:55.787 --> 25:58.153
Hallelujah!
Ready to get your ass kicked?

25:58.657 --> 26:00.284
You wish.

26:03.795 --> 26:08.732
- So how's your day going?
- It's a fiesta.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.961
Kyle channeled a supernatural dimension.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.229
What?

26:12.337 --> 26:15.431
The Ouija board. It spelled out
some weird number for him.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.940
He was totally pushing it.

26:18.043 --> 26:20.671
Of course, but he may not realize
he was doing it,

26:20.745 --> 26:24.704
in which case, maybe it's another memory
trying to claw its way out.

26:24.783 --> 26:26.842
Did he say he knew
what the number meant?

26:27.652 --> 26:29.882
Of course not, that would be too easy.

26:30.455 --> 26:32.582
Well, I have to talk to him about it.

26:34.826 --> 26:36.851
He asked it when his birthday was.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.294
He's having a hard time
with that today.

26:39.364 --> 26:40.922
Everyone's weird today.

26:40.999 --> 26:44.059
Even Declan, who's usually
dependably un-weird.

26:45.136 --> 26:47.604
So, what's going on with him?

26:47.672 --> 26:50.732
I don't know.
He won't talk to me.

26:50.809 --> 26:53.471
I haven't mastered
the art of shrinking like you.

26:53.545 --> 26:56.605
Well, sometimes the easiest way
to get somebody to open up

26:56.681 --> 27:00.981
is to just be there for them without
judgment when they're ready to spill.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.522
Yeah. See, that's the problem.
I live for judgment.

27:07.125 --> 27:10.617
You and Declan definitely
seem to be getting closer.

27:10.695 --> 27:11.787
Yeah, I guess.

27:11.863 --> 27:15.629
I guess you probably feel
that you're ready for more...

27:15.734 --> 27:17.258
...physically, I mean.

27:21.239 --> 27:22.968
Are you shrinking me right now?

27:23.708 --> 27:26.939
Shrinking, momming, you know...
whatever works.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.979
Stick to baking.
It's less mortifying.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.813
You know,
life can be mortifying sometimes.

27:33.885 --> 27:37.116
And trust me,
sometimes sex can be too.

27:37.856 --> 27:41.155
That's straying from the usual
"when two people love each other

27:41.226 --> 27:44.161
- they make magic" script.
- Well, that's true too.

27:44.229 --> 27:47.289
It's just that
it doesn't always happen that way,

27:47.365 --> 27:49.196
especially if you rush into things.

27:51.870 --> 27:53.235
You're right.

27:54.639 --> 27:57.073
- I am?
- I'm not ready.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.624
What did you find?

28:18.697 --> 28:22.827
9,734 hits for "7-8-1-2-2-7".

28:24.703 --> 28:27.729
Try "7-8-1-2-2-7" and "alien".

28:27.806 --> 28:29.171
That's not funny.

28:29.240 --> 28:32.004
How about "freaky meteorologist"?

28:32.110 --> 28:34.374
Try "7-8-1-2-2-7", "birthday".

28:42.053 --> 28:43.020
Nothing.

28:43.121 --> 28:46.215
Doesn't matter.
I've got the whole thing figured out.

28:46.291 --> 28:47.383
How?

28:49.094 --> 28:51.187
You sure you can handle it?

28:54.666 --> 28:58.193
My theory is you're
an alien-human hybrid.

28:58.269 --> 29:02.035
The meta-geeks who created you
put you here to be their lab rat.

29:02.107 --> 29:05.133
Maybe he's here to check
the climate for inhabitability.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.440
That would explain the weather thing.

29:07.512 --> 29:08.877
- Stop.
- Seriously.

29:08.980 --> 29:11.881
They're watching you interact with us,
taking notes.

29:11.950 --> 29:15.886
So they can wipe us out and replace us
with a master race of hybrid freaks.

29:15.954 --> 29:20.186
Then, when they've done enough recon,
they'll beam down and take you away.

29:20.258 --> 29:22.021
- Please stop.
- I don't think...

29:22.127 --> 29:23.992
No, it's OK.
Here's the beauty of it.

29:24.062 --> 29:27.759
It's totally out of our hands, and
there's nothing we can do to change it.

29:27.832 --> 29:29.925
So you gotta go with the flow,
you know?

29:30.001 --> 29:31.093
Josh!

29:32.003 --> 29:33.732
I don't want to hear any more!

29:35.273 --> 29:37.434
How is this supposed to make me feel?

29:40.512 --> 29:42.275
"Searches for alien mother ship"?

29:43.615 --> 29:45.378
"Sleeps in a bathtub"?

29:46.451 --> 29:48.351
"Memorizes the encyclopedia"?

29:50.155 --> 29:51.588
"Predicts lightning"?

29:52.690 --> 29:54.021
This is fun for you.

29:54.626 --> 29:58.892
Everyone around here gets a kick
out of it, but this notebook,

29:58.963 --> 30:02.194
this is the only thing I know
about my entire life!

30:03.368 --> 30:04.995
- Kyle.
- Mom, I didn't...

30:05.069 --> 30:07.833
I need you to go upstairs.
Please, all of you.

30:14.045 --> 30:16.013
I can't feel like this anymore.

30:16.781 --> 30:19.147
I don't wanna be this freak
in Josh's notebook.

30:19.217 --> 30:20.343
I need to know who I am.

30:20.418 --> 30:23.910
Kyle, I want you to listen
to something, OK?

30:23.988 --> 30:25.717
Come on, sit down.

30:30.728 --> 30:33.356
Forget about everything else
you're feeling now

30:33.431 --> 30:35.763
and just listen to the sound
of my voice.

30:38.369 --> 30:42.328
Now, find the rhythm of the other sounds
in the room.

30:44.542 --> 30:46.874
Listen to the water dripping
off the gutter.

30:49.414 --> 30:51.279
Breathe into that sound.

30:53.551 --> 30:56.111
Let it fill you up.

30:58.156 --> 31:01.592
Let your mind and your heartbeat
connect to it.

31:04.829 --> 31:06.194
Good.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.966
Good.

31:14.138 --> 31:16.231
It's all gonna be OK.

31:41.432 --> 31:44.094
I am the scum of the earth.

31:44.769 --> 31:49.399
You're not scum.
Maybe like, algae.

31:49.474 --> 31:51.908
Nobody knew how much
that stuff bugged him.

31:52.977 --> 31:55.309
Here I am,
whining because I'm not psyched

31:55.380 --> 31:57.940
about the way my life has turned out,

31:58.016 --> 32:01.144
and he's wishing he could remember
the things he regrets.

32:01.219 --> 32:04.188
Maybe I'm upset about things
that happened in the past,

32:04.255 --> 32:07.418
but at least I have one.
He's just this total blank.

32:07.492 --> 32:13.260
- That doesn't sound so bad to me.
- But it feels bad. Kyle feels bad.

32:14.799 --> 32:16.266
It sucks.

32:24.375 --> 32:25.706
Come on in, Tom.

32:26.844 --> 32:30.143
I've got some information
about your intruder.

32:30.815 --> 32:32.282
Hi there.

32:34.319 --> 32:35.786
How are you doing?

32:38.056 --> 32:39.421
I know you.

32:39.857 --> 32:42.690
You recognize me
from patrolling the neighborhood.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.320
- You had some news?
- Yeah. According to police,

32:45.396 --> 32:48.126
there was a hit-and-run around 2:00am.

32:48.199 --> 32:50.759
No one was hurt and
was probably caused by weather,

32:50.835 --> 32:53.929
and not reckless driving,
but a driver fled the scene,

32:54.005 --> 32:55.905
which is a crime, so...

32:55.974 --> 32:57.999
Why would he lurk outside our house?

32:58.076 --> 33:00.135
Who was lurking outside our house?

33:00.211 --> 33:02.975
We didn't want to worry you,
but we found some blood

33:03.081 --> 33:04.810
on the sill outside your window.

33:04.882 --> 33:08.943
We think that man from your drawing
must have actually been at your window.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.418
Hit-and-run?

33:14.592 --> 33:16.753
In my room, now!

33:20.498 --> 33:21.988
OK, I panicked.

33:22.066 --> 33:24.626
I was on my way home,
it was really hard to see,

33:24.702 --> 33:26.602
and I skidded and hit another car.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.901
I freaked out and drove off.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.541
The light, it was on in Kyle's room,
and he let me in.

33:32.610 --> 33:35.170
I couldn't go home.
My dad would have murdered me.

33:35.246 --> 33:37.009
Every time I think you're a good guy,

33:37.115 --> 33:39.777
you do something
to completely annihilate yourself.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.819
You think I don't know that?

33:41.919 --> 33:47.152
You can't believe that I don't recognize
that I'm a total disaster of a person.

33:47.225 --> 33:50.194
I'm sorry. I'm judging.

33:50.928 --> 33:52.828
I get mad and that's what I do.

33:55.666 --> 33:59.329
Look, I know we've had
a lot of back and forth,

33:59.404 --> 34:03.306
and played a lot of idiot games
with each other,

34:03.374 --> 34:06.468
but you've been a really good friend
to me lately.

34:06.544 --> 34:11.708
And if you need someone
to be that for you, I'm here.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.380
That's all I want you to know.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.896
What do I do now?

34:28.399 --> 34:30.560
Depends on which guy you want to be.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.768
I have to turn myself in.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.507
I'm so dead.

34:38.443 --> 34:39.876
I'll visit you at County.

34:39.944 --> 34:42.105
- You don't really think...
- No.

34:42.213 --> 34:43.908
You'll be fine.

34:44.916 --> 34:48.079
It's the right thing to do,
so you can pat yourself on the back

34:48.152 --> 34:50.416
for not being totally unredeemable.

34:52.356 --> 34:55.449
This friendship thing
might work out OK, huh, Trager?

34:55.525 --> 34:57.083
Sure.

34:57.161 --> 34:59.061
McDonough.

35:02.366 --> 35:03.731
Spring cleaning?

35:04.268 --> 35:06.896
I don't want to be reminded
of what I can't remember.

35:09.574 --> 35:11.337
I think you've got this all wrong.

35:13.077 --> 35:14.806
You do?

35:15.379 --> 35:16.903
Yeah.

35:16.981 --> 35:19.541
You may not have anything
to hold onto now,

35:19.617 --> 35:22.085
but maybe tomorrow
there'll be a new memory.

35:22.153 --> 35:24.018
And the day after that another one.

35:24.088 --> 35:26.022
Soon you'll be drowning in them.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.295
Maybe.

35:33.831 --> 35:35.594
But see, the rest of us,

35:35.700 --> 35:38.066
as we grow up,
our memories get dimmer.

35:38.136 --> 35:42.300
And we try anything we can to stop them
from disappearing completely.

35:42.373 --> 35:44.307
If you ask me, you got the better deal.

35:47.245 --> 35:48.371
Thank you.

35:49.847 --> 35:52.680
- For what?
- For making me feel better.

35:56.554 --> 35:58.522
You make me feel like there's hope.

36:00.458 --> 36:04.155
Everyone needs hope.
It gets us through the rough spots.

36:07.331 --> 36:10.960
- Will you tell me about him?
- Who?

36:11.035 --> 36:12.866
Your dad.

36:15.273 --> 36:16.797
Sure.

36:17.542 --> 36:18.702
But not here.

36:21.245 --> 36:22.576
In here.

36:24.081 --> 36:25.605
Wallow central.

36:33.624 --> 36:36.388
First off,
he was nothing like my mother.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.858
But she was different around him.
It was impossible not to be.

36:40.965 --> 36:43.331
Lighter, happier...

36:43.434 --> 36:46.597
I remember this one time he took me
to get my ears pierced...

36:47.171 --> 36:52.438
- So Kyle doesn't have a serial stalker.
- Or little green men watching over him.

36:53.110 --> 36:55.977
Just a teenage boy
afraid to tell his dad what he did.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.207
Yeah.

36:57.281 --> 36:59.613
By the way, Lori's not a virgin anymore.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.212
You segued to that?

37:04.288 --> 37:06.415
Thought I'd rip the bandage off quickly.

37:06.490 --> 37:08.958
- Did she tell you?
- No, of course not.

37:09.026 --> 37:11.995
But I was talking to her
about not being ready for sex yet

37:12.063 --> 37:13.291
and she agreed with me.

37:13.364 --> 37:16.731
Oh, man.
I am not ready for this.

37:20.671 --> 37:21.831
It's Declan.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.340
- Car-wrecking, home-invading...
- Stephen.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.375
I'll kill him.

37:25.476 --> 37:28.912
You slept with Shelly Peterson
and weren't much older than Josh.

37:28.980 --> 37:32.507
You're not allowed to use
something I said after ten tequila shots

37:32.583 --> 37:35.643
- on our honeymoon against me.
- Did it screw you up for life?

37:35.720 --> 37:38.814
That's not fair.
It's different for girls.

37:41.025 --> 37:43.391
- Isn't it?
- I think she's fine.

37:43.461 --> 37:47.227
You know, talking to her earlier,
there's something there, like...

37:47.298 --> 37:51.064
I don't know. Whatever she's experienced
has made her more together.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.829
She's growing up.

37:58.242 --> 38:00.608
We don't have to worry
about Josh, do we?

38:00.711 --> 38:03.339
Josh still stashes porn
in his board games.

38:03.414 --> 38:06.781
That's not a boy who is anywhere close
to being sexually active.

38:10.354 --> 38:11.719
Hey.

38:12.323 --> 38:16.817
If Declan was the person at the window,
who's the man in Kyle's drawings?

38:18.829 --> 38:22.788
The police station's gonna be a party
compared to what I got coming at home.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.664
Here's one from the parental
manipulation handbook:

38:25.770 --> 38:28.864
Just apologize, cry a little,

38:28.939 --> 38:31.305
throw out a few self-loathing comments.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.639
He'll end up
trying to make you feel better.

38:37.348 --> 38:40.442
You know what you said about me
duping you into having sex?

38:40.518 --> 38:44.750
- Yeah. It's really not a big deal.
- It is.

38:44.822 --> 38:48.087
Know that no matter what
Hilary said to give me the push,

38:48.159 --> 38:51.390
she made me realize
I was about to lose you.

38:51.462 --> 38:55.398
That's why I asked you out,
because I wanted to.

38:58.302 --> 38:59.860
Thank you for that.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.131
It's a shame it sucked so bad.

39:05.609 --> 39:06.940
Goodbye.

39:26.497 --> 39:28.328
Happy birthday, Lori.

39:39.410 --> 39:41.037
How are you feeling?

39:42.046 --> 39:43.013
Better.

39:43.114 --> 39:46.140
Lori told me about the number
you discovered.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.050
Seven-eight-one-two-two-seven.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.281
You want to talk about it?

39:53.958 --> 39:55.585
Tomorrow.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.590
- Can I help?
- Sure.

39:59.497 --> 40:01.260
I'll go gather everybody.

40:11.008 --> 40:12.373
I'm not mad at you.

40:12.810 --> 40:15.040
Thank God.

40:21.051 --> 40:23.212
If you're gonna be part of this family,

40:23.287 --> 40:26.654
you've got to understand
all the traditions.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.768
OK.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.995
Here we go.

40:41.071 --> 40:43.335
- One, two, three...
- Wait, wait, wait!

40:44.775 --> 40:47.608
I was thinking,
if it's OK with Kyle,

40:48.646 --> 40:51.206
I want to share my birthday with you.

40:52.116 --> 40:55.279
At least until you remember
when your real birthday is.

40:57.254 --> 40:59.188
Thank you.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.518
You can help me blow out
the candles and make a wish.

41:03.627 --> 41:06.152
Make a wish to age better than Lori.

41:11.001 --> 41:14.767
Do you know what you'll wish for?
Don't say it or it won't come true.

41:15.339 --> 41:17.307
It's another birthday tradition.

41:17.808 --> 41:19.742
That doesn't make any sense.

41:19.810 --> 41:22.176
You're right. Screw it.
What do you wish for?

41:31.622 --> 41:34.386
- I think I'll keep with the tradition.
- OK.

41:35.192 --> 41:36.659
Let's do it.

41:41.932 --> 41:45.368
Josh. It never gets old, does it?

41:45.636 --> 41:48.400
<i>With the flash of the camera
the Tragers gave me</i>

41:48.506 --> 41:50.667
<i>the first page of my history.</i>

41:50.774 --> 41:54.073
<i>It may not go back
as far as Lori's or Josh's,</i>

41:54.144 --> 41:56.305
<i>but I finally had a beginning.</i>

41:57.548 --> 42:00.039
<i>And then my birthday wish came true.</i>

42:00.117 --> 42:02.551
<i>It made me feel like anything,</i>

42:02.620 --> 42:04.645
<i>anything was possible.</i>

42:19.203 --> 42:20.830
What's the forecast say?

42:21.639 --> 42:23.869
Sunny in the 60's through Tuesday.

42:23.941 --> 42:25.272
Rain.

42:28.546 --> 42:29.877
Damn.

42:42.092 --> 42:43.787
Kyle, what's wrong?

42:45.996 --> 42:47.554
That's him.

43:16.660 --> 43:21.029
<i>Detective, there's
a Nicole Trager on the phone for you.</i>

43:21.131 --> 43:23.065
<i>- Put her through.
- Yes, sir.</i>

43:24.969 --> 43:28.132
Mrs. Trager, what can we do for you?

43:29.305 --> 43:35.163
