[Elodie] Last week,
I heard the story on the news

00:31.364 --> 00:34.576
about a stolen sculpture worth
60 million dollars.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.996
The thief buried it
in the middle of the forest.

00:39.622 --> 00:42.751
But... after 40 years,
he couldn't take it anymore.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.463
He called the cops and turned himself in.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.883
He led them to the woods
and watched as they dug it up.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.095
He said he felt proud
when they finally pulled the statue out...

00:55.180 --> 00:57.932
because he'd finally
gotten to tell someone.

00:58.016 --> 01:02.729
He'd gotten to confess his crime
and all of its glorious detail.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.607
It makes sense, right?

01:06.649 --> 01:09.736
'Cause...
stealing alone can drive you crazy.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.823
The only thing
that makes any of that worthwhile is...

01:14.783 --> 01:16.451
having someone to share it with.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.209
Oh, boo, that was kinda cute.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.752
You really love us, huh?

01:25.835 --> 01:27.337

01:28.046 --> 01:29.339
