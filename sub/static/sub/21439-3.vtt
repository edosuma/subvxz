00:00.883 --> 00:03.282
Hey, man. Huh? That
show I told you about,

00:03.402 --> 00:06.286
where people rent a cabin in the
mountains, is on again tonight.

00:06.288 --> 00:09.256
It's pretty much a different story
each week with brand-new characters,

00:09.258 --> 00:11.255
but there's a few
things you should know.

00:11.375 --> 00:13.219
So, there's this
stripper at a bikini bar

00:13.339 --> 00:15.709
who secretly records guys
doing crazy foot stuff,

00:15.829 --> 00:17.778
and then her and her
stepson blackmail them.

00:17.898 --> 00:19.862
And there's this old couple

00:19.982 --> 00:21.719
who gives out the keys
to people who rent the cabins,

00:21.839 --> 00:23.656
and the old dude started
going to the bikini bar.

00:23.776 --> 00:25.686
There's also a guy who lives
next door to the cabin

00:25.806 --> 00:27.083
who's going through a divorce,

00:27.203 --> 00:28.841
but I don't know what
the deal with him is yet.

00:28.961 --> 00:30.880
- Anyways, you should check it out.
- Yeah, I don't know.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.035
My mother usually controls the clicker.

01:04.018 --> 01:06.953
Dear Jennifer, something
crazy just happened,

01:06.955 --> 01:09.789
so I thought I'd let you know
about it in your guest book.

01:09.791 --> 01:11.939
It all started when my husband decided

01:12.059 --> 01:14.248
we should treat his
boss and his new wife

01:14.368 --> 01:16.195
to a vacation in the mountains.

01:27.342 --> 01:29.041
Let me do the talking.

01:32.296 --> 01:35.130
- In a hurry?
- Yeah. Sorry, officer.

01:35.132 --> 01:37.885
Um, normally, I would
be the one driving, but

01:38.005 --> 01:40.463
we stopped for lunch,
and my boss back there

01:40.583 --> 01:42.905
pressured me into having
a couple of beers.

01:42.907 --> 01:45.474
So, maybe you could let
us off with a warning

01:45.594 --> 01:48.177
since we were being so responsible.

01:48.730 --> 01:50.479
I guess that sounds fair.

01:51.273 --> 01:54.383
So your boss... Was
he drinking, as well?

01:54.385 --> 01:55.851
Which boss?

01:56.788 --> 01:59.793
Sir, will you step out
of the car, please?

02:11.490 --> 02:13.936
Got one. He wouldn't
let me do much to him,

02:14.056 --> 02:16.298
but he's wearing a ring,
so I bet he'll cough up

02:16.418 --> 02:18.941
a couple hundred once
he learns it's all on tape.

02:18.943 --> 02:21.714
Okay. Hey, I, uh, found this picture

02:21.834 --> 02:23.445
of you, me, and my dad.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.746
I was thinking we could
put it up behind the bar.

02:25.866 --> 02:28.740
People come in here to get drunk
and stare at bouncing titties,

02:28.860 --> 02:30.476
not pictures of dead black men.

02:30.596 --> 02:33.013
Besides, I was only married to
your father for like a month.

02:33.133 --> 02:35.224
Keep it in your pocket
if you miss him so much.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.858
That's twice!

02:52.978 --> 02:56.078
What'd you do, watch a pantyhose
commercial or somethin'?

02:56.080 --> 02:58.514
That... first of all, that's ridiculous.

02:58.516 --> 03:01.854
You told me to speed up,
so how is this my fault?

03:01.974 --> 03:03.267
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

03:03.387 --> 03:05.449
We're here to pick up the
key for Froggy Cottage.

03:05.569 --> 03:07.857
- Coming right up.
- David just called.

03:07.977 --> 03:09.792
We can pick him up at the station.

03:09.794 --> 03:12.227
I'm gonna run next door
and get him some whiskey.

03:12.229 --> 03:14.129
He sounded fussy.

03:25.859 --> 03:27.694
Chubbys... we won't tell if you don't.

03:27.814 --> 03:30.098
Bullshit. Hey, it's me.

03:30.218 --> 03:32.381
I don't think I should do this one.

03:32.383 --> 03:34.583
It looks like he was just
trying to get things going

03:34.585 --> 03:37.886
so he could bang his old
wife, and that can't be easy.

03:37.888 --> 03:41.056
I don't care. Business around
here isn't exactly thriving.

03:42.144 --> 03:44.777
Pick 'em up... slow.

03:44.897 --> 03:46.562
Look, blackmailing these horny tourists

03:46.564 --> 03:48.163
is the only way to keep this place open.

03:48.165 --> 03:49.598
And I can't go back to dental hygiening.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.367
- That's how I got Hep C.
- I know, but...

03:51.369 --> 03:54.703
Don't come back here without
my money and a Twix!

04:02.228 --> 04:05.234
Yep, they got my laptop,
and they took her purse.

04:05.883 --> 04:08.450
Well, just make sure to
cancel all her credit cards.

04:08.452 --> 04:10.285
Hey, I'm really sorry about this.

04:10.287 --> 04:11.654
Shh! I can't believe...

04:11.656 --> 04:15.157
No, not you. Someone's bothering me.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.057
Hey! Psst!

04:20.329 --> 04:22.666
Do you have any Plan B
pills I could borrow?

04:22.786 --> 04:24.600
- Excuse me?
- Don't tell David

04:24.720 --> 04:26.368
because he's super pro-life,

04:26.370 --> 04:28.170
but mine were in the
purse that got stolen.

04:28.172 --> 04:31.022
David hates condoms, so
he told me to get on the pill.

04:31.142 --> 04:33.275
But the pill gives me
whiskers on my chin,

04:33.277 --> 04:35.844
so I've been secretly
taking Plan B instead.

04:35.846 --> 04:38.447
Anyway, do you have any I could borrow?

04:38.449 --> 04:39.982
No, sorry.

04:39.984 --> 04:42.718
Had a hysterectomy in my 20s.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.687
Lucky.

04:44.689 --> 04:48.090
I bet you lost, like, 2
pounds just like that.

04:51.539 --> 04:54.502
Hey, buddy. Come on, man.

04:55.299 --> 04:56.565
Hey!

04:56.906 --> 04:58.336
What's that about?

04:58.456 --> 05:00.426
I told him this was all your fault.

05:00.546 --> 05:03.138
The separation? Why would you do that?

05:03.140 --> 05:04.640
- Because it is.
- How?

05:04.642 --> 05:06.508
Plus, I had a date the other night,

05:06.510 --> 05:08.486
and he kept judging me with
those little beady eyes of his.

05:08.606 --> 05:10.579
I had to tell him something
to get him off my back.

05:10.581 --> 05:12.635
You're dating now?

05:13.150 --> 05:16.326
A guy from the gym took
me to the Red Lobster.

05:16.446 --> 05:17.853
Don't get all weepy.

05:17.855 --> 05:19.421
Mm-hmm.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.487
Pussy.

05:27.624 --> 05:29.641
- Who's thirsty?
- I'll have one.

05:29.761 --> 05:31.900
Uh, but Phyllis doesn't drink.

05:35.276 --> 05:38.998
Last one in the hot tub has body issues!

05:39.118 --> 05:40.676
I don't drink?

05:40.678 --> 05:42.825
This weekend is already a disaster.

05:42.945 --> 05:44.407
And you get mouthy when you're drunk.

05:44.527 --> 05:47.016
I don't need another St. Patrick's Day.

05:47.859 --> 05:50.614
Fine. But your niece started that.

05:50.734 --> 05:53.043
- She's 8.
- She's racist.

05:53.163 --> 05:56.458
The alcohol kept flowing,
and by the end of the night,

05:56.460 --> 05:59.928
everyone except me could barely
make it back to their bedrooms.

06:01.232 --> 06:02.865
And that's when it happened.

06:14.712 --> 06:16.011
Hello?

06:16.013 --> 06:18.681
Jennifer, is that you? It's me, Marcia.

06:18.683 --> 06:21.150
I-I have to hurry. He's in the bathroom.

06:21.270 --> 06:22.685
I'm sorry. I think you...

06:22.687 --> 06:24.253
Who are you talking to?

06:24.255 --> 06:26.922
No one! It's just the cats.

06:33.306 --> 06:35.094
Getting a call like that

06:35.214 --> 06:37.081
in the middle of the
night was pretty jarring,

06:37.201 --> 06:39.048
but since John blames me

06:39.050 --> 06:41.622
for anything bad or
strange that ever happens,

06:41.742 --> 06:44.923
I tried to go back to bed
and just forget about it.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.291
- Hello?
- Jennifer, I need help.

06:53.411 --> 06:56.682
Okay, look, I'm not Jennifer.
We're just renting the place, okay?

06:56.802 --> 06:59.101
Yeah? You... Maybe you want the owners?

06:59.221 --> 07:01.654
Yes! Oh, I'm looking for
my sister, Jennifer.

07:01.774 --> 07:04.834
Ah, she always said she was gonna
move away and rent the place out.

07:04.954 --> 07:06.877
Damn, I really needed
her to wire me money

07:06.879 --> 07:09.246
for a bus ticket so that
I can leave my husband.

07:10.449 --> 07:12.582
- Are you being abused?
- Oh, no, no.

07:12.584 --> 07:14.684
I'm... I'm in a plural marriage,

07:14.686 --> 07:16.753
and I'm beginning to
have second thoughts

07:16.755 --> 07:18.860
about being married to
one man and three women.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.590
You know, this latest wife is 24

07:20.592 --> 07:22.225
and he gave her bedroom duties

07:22.227 --> 07:24.361
and put me in charge of
laundry and pet care.

07:24.363 --> 07:27.553
- Well, that sounds terrible.
- Oh, it is.

07:27.673 --> 07:30.449
You know, I would just... I
would buy the bus ticket myself,

07:30.569 --> 07:32.536
except the sister wife who's
in charge of finances

07:32.538 --> 07:35.138
never lets the debit
card out of her sight.

07:35.140 --> 07:37.374
Man, if you could pay for a bus ticket

07:37.376 --> 07:39.142
with dryer sheets and kitty litter,

07:39.144 --> 07:41.578
I would've been out of here months ago.

07:42.910 --> 07:44.512
What?

07:44.632 --> 07:46.727
Jesus! Um, hey.

07:46.847 --> 07:48.752
H-H-How much money do you need?

07:49.187 --> 07:52.389
I used my phone to go online
and wire her the money.

07:52.391 --> 07:54.424
You don't have to pay me back, Jen.

07:54.426 --> 07:57.227
I like to think you'd do
the same for my sister.

07:57.229 --> 07:59.349
Take care. Phyllis.

08:00.910 --> 08:03.869
So, when you, uh, retired,

08:03.989 --> 08:05.740
what was your specialty?

08:05.860 --> 08:07.638
Shiatsu, reflexology?

08:07.758 --> 08:10.907
I would just touch the
guys really soft and slow.

08:10.909 --> 08:13.510
If he was a regular, I'd
let the back of my hand

08:13.512 --> 08:16.213
accidentally brush up against
his nut sack a few times.

08:16.215 --> 08:18.856
- Is that how you met David?
- Oh, no.

08:18.976 --> 08:22.501
- He wasn't a client.
- No, we met at a Mike Huckabee rally.

08:22.621 --> 08:24.654
David was holding a sign that said...

08:24.656 --> 08:26.468
What did it say again, honey?

08:26.588 --> 08:28.959
"If babies had guns, they
wouldn't be aborted."

08:28.961 --> 08:32.030
I didn't understand it at first,
so he explained it to me.

08:32.150 --> 08:34.496
And then he complimented me on my eyes,

08:34.499 --> 08:36.366
which pissed off his wife.

08:36.368 --> 08:38.635
Who turned out to be a
real bitch, by the way.

08:38.636 --> 08:41.004
- Total bitch.
- Anyway...

08:41.006 --> 08:42.940
Ah.

08:43.059 --> 08:44.522
Where did you get that?

08:44.642 --> 08:47.177
I won it in a silent
auction at a charity event

08:47.179 --> 08:49.212
for kids with jacked-up smiles.

08:49.214 --> 08:51.894
I've been wanting to get out
of the city and give it a go.

08:53.276 --> 08:56.418
- Hey, bud. You want to play some catch?
- No.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.323
Okay.

09:00.812 --> 09:02.626
Wanna talk about what your mom said?

09:02.746 --> 09:04.694
No.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.132
- Oh, sh...
- Oh.

09:16.045 --> 09:18.842
Whoa. Cool!

09:20.822 --> 09:22.712
Hello?

09:22.714 --> 09:25.315
Phyllis, I did it. I got out.

09:25.317 --> 09:26.917
I didn't even say goodbye to the cat.

09:26.919 --> 09:28.585
I was hoping you could pick me up.

09:28.587 --> 09:30.654
I'm across the street from a bikini bar.

09:30.656 --> 09:32.445
You're here?

09:32.565 --> 09:34.509
Yeah, the bus let me
off right in front of

09:34.629 --> 09:37.260
Wang's Tastey Delightful.

09:37.262 --> 09:39.429
Uh, Marcia?

09:39.431 --> 09:41.765
My husband's boss is here,

09:41.767 --> 09:44.467
and even though things started
out real rough at first,

09:44.469 --> 09:46.036
they're going well now, okay?

09:46.038 --> 09:48.967
I-I can't throw the midnight
caller into the mix.

09:49.087 --> 09:51.374
Well, I-I just need to
walk around the house

09:51.376 --> 09:53.554
and look for a clue
how to find my sister.

09:53.674 --> 09:55.045
Please, Phyllis.

09:55.047 --> 09:57.647
You're the only friend I have right now.

09:58.421 --> 10:00.216
Please?

10:02.896 --> 10:05.889
Be right back. We're out of milk.

10:06.009 --> 10:07.891
Hey, Bethany should be able to make milk

10:07.893 --> 10:09.527
with how much I paid for her titties.

10:11.430 --> 10:12.909
She didn't get it.

10:13.417 --> 10:15.208
Hello, it's Phyllis again.

10:15.328 --> 10:17.998
Last I left you, I was heading
over to pick up Marcia.

10:21.442 --> 10:22.641
Marcia.

10:22.643 --> 10:24.443
Oh. How'd you guess?

10:24.445 --> 10:26.378
You're wearing four wedding bands.

10:26.380 --> 10:28.280
Oh.

10:28.282 --> 10:30.182
Yeah, hey, listen, do me a favor.

10:30.184 --> 10:33.319
Go inside, order me a
slippery shrimp, okay?

10:33.321 --> 10:35.187
I'm gonna go park the car.
I don't wanna take you back

10:35.189 --> 10:37.022
to the house till everyone's tits up.

10:37.024 --> 10:40.074
Okay. Slipper... Okay. Tits up. Got it.

10:48.569 --> 10:50.302
$1 for the teeth-bleaching strips.

10:50.304 --> 10:51.837
Do I have $1 and 10 cents?

10:53.140 --> 10:55.169
- Sold.
- Yay!

10:55.289 --> 10:57.977
I'm gonna see if these
work on buttholes.

10:57.979 --> 11:00.279
They don't. It just stings.

11:00.281 --> 11:03.182
Oh, now here's something you
both might be interested in.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.666
Plan B. Let's start the bidding

11:05.786 --> 11:08.387
on this convenient
little abortion at $3.

11:11.470 --> 11:14.443
Sorry. Are you closed?

11:14.563 --> 11:16.879
- No, we're open.
- Great!

11:18.250 --> 11:20.791
Your shoe's untied, buddy.

11:21.269 --> 11:24.637
Hey, Frank, can I talk to
you outside for a second?

11:25.522 --> 11:27.072
You lied to me.

11:27.074 --> 11:28.807
I should've known that
old man wouldn't have

11:28.809 --> 11:30.509
given you a laptop and a purse.

11:30.511 --> 11:32.111
Yeah, I stole it.

11:32.113 --> 11:33.979
I couldn't blackmail him.

11:33.981 --> 11:35.881
There are not that many
black people up here,

11:35.883 --> 11:38.350
and it doesn't feel right to
start turning on each other.

11:38.352 --> 11:40.052
He's not a tourist?

11:40.054 --> 11:42.528
No. He works at that rental place.

11:42.648 --> 11:44.790
Rents Cabins for the Owners.

11:44.792 --> 11:46.692
He gives people the keys.

11:46.694 --> 11:48.694
That old dude has a key

11:48.696 --> 11:51.712
- to every rental cabin on the mountain?
- Yeah.

11:53.998 --> 11:57.227
Well, let's get him a drink and
make sure he keeps coming back.

11:57.347 --> 12:00.195
That guy's our new retirement plan.

12:00.315 --> 12:03.309
So, uh, plural marriage...
not for you, huh?

12:03.311 --> 12:05.377
Uh, I don't know if I'm
against plural marriage,

12:05.379 --> 12:08.197
or if I just haven't found
the right guy and gal

12:08.317 --> 12:10.665
- and gal and gal.
- Yeah, well, you know,

12:10.785 --> 12:12.918
finding one of those is hard enough.

12:12.920 --> 12:14.987
John and I get along pretty
well most of the time,

12:14.989 --> 12:17.623
but man, this week
has been so stressful.

12:17.625 --> 12:20.292
Plus, anytime anything goes
wrong, he just blames me.

12:20.294 --> 12:22.761
My husband and wives do that to me, too.

12:22.763 --> 12:24.396
- Get out of here!
- I'm serious.

12:24.398 --> 12:27.618
It all started after I had
the worst Thursday ever.

12:27.738 --> 12:29.802
My bedroom in the basement flooded,

12:29.804 --> 12:31.236
a vending machine fell on me,

12:31.238 --> 12:33.238
and my favorite cat
accidentally hung herself.

12:33.240 --> 12:36.075
Ever since that happened,
anytime anything goes wrong,

12:36.466 --> 12:38.733
they say it's my fault
because I'm cursed.

12:38.853 --> 12:40.646
Okay, that is bullshit.

12:40.648 --> 12:42.281
That is total bullshit.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.669
- You know, they call me "Schleprock".
- What?

12:44.789 --> 12:46.251
Which is some sort of reference

12:46.253 --> 12:48.253
to "The Flintstones"
that I don't even get.

12:48.255 --> 12:50.251
But I told myself, "If
they call me that one

12:50.371 --> 12:52.157
"more time, I am leaving."

12:52.159 --> 12:54.579
What do you think they
called me last night?

12:54.699 --> 12:55.949
Hmm.

12:56.287 --> 12:58.037
"Schleppy."

12:58.366 --> 13:00.699
But it was short for "Schleprock."

13:00.701 --> 13:01.802
Wow.

13:01.922 --> 13:04.386
John calls me "Drama Magnet."

13:04.506 --> 13:05.672
Oh.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.240
It's not from a cartoon,

13:07.360 --> 13:09.842
but you know, if he ever does it again,

13:09.844 --> 13:11.777
I'm gonna just stand up for myself.

13:11.779 --> 13:14.474
You've inspired me, Marcia. I'm
not gonna take it anymore.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.149
Good for you.

13:18.820 --> 13:21.434
Anyone ever tell you you
smell like snickerdoodles?

13:21.554 --> 13:24.390
Yes! I've heard that quite a few times.

13:25.575 --> 13:27.315
- It's good, right?
- It's great.

13:29.130 --> 13:31.255
Once it was dark, I figured it was safe

13:31.375 --> 13:34.033
to take Marcia back to the house.

13:36.337 --> 13:39.672
Probably best if we don't
tell your mom about this.

13:39.674 --> 13:41.774
You can try it next
time you visit, okay?

13:41.776 --> 13:44.692
- You want to keep visiting, right?
- Are you kidding? Of course.

13:44.812 --> 13:46.123
Good.

13:47.315 --> 13:50.449
Can I shoot this with my shirt off?

13:50.451 --> 13:52.718
I don't see why not.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.320
This isn't my sister's house.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.958
My sister's house is yellow,

13:58.960 --> 14:01.727
and the mailbox is a mini Eiffel Tower.

14:01.729 --> 14:04.849
Marcia, this is the house you called.

14:08.469 --> 14:11.658
What... Does that look like a 2 or a 3?

14:11.778 --> 14:12.962
Uh,

14:13.082 --> 14:16.075
I-I don't know because it's...
it's very smudged.

14:16.077 --> 14:19.011
It could be a zero.
Actually, it's all smudged.

14:19.013 --> 14:21.992
I know. I guessed at most of those.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.450
I think... I think the cats peed on it.

14:24.452 --> 14:25.851
Oh, seriously?

14:25.853 --> 14:28.510
I think they knew I was leaving.

14:29.190 --> 14:31.624
At this point, we both realized

14:31.626 --> 14:33.262
something that you must have known

14:33.382 --> 14:35.227
when you started reading this story...

14:35.229 --> 14:38.497
You're not Jennifer, and
Marcia is not your sister.

14:43.502 --> 14:46.472
Oh. Oh, boy.

14:46.474 --> 14:48.440
Do you care if I sleep on the porch,

14:48.442 --> 14:50.476
and then tomorrow I can walk around

14:50.478 --> 14:52.578
and... and try and find
my sister's house?

14:52.580 --> 14:54.780
No, you can't sleep
outside. You'll freeze.

14:55.950 --> 14:57.883
I have an idea.

15:00.121 --> 15:03.263
Since my car is so small, I
let her sleep in David's car.

15:03.383 --> 15:05.257
Worst case... They'll wonder why

15:05.259 --> 15:07.226
their car smells like snickerdoodles.

15:07.228 --> 15:09.795
Anyway, just thought you'd wanna
hear how things turned out

15:09.797 --> 15:11.830
even if it wasn't your sister.

15:15.614 --> 15:18.237
Oh, by the way, don't wanna
make a big deal out of it...

15:18.239 --> 15:20.606
There was a used syringe
in your driveway.

15:22.176 --> 15:24.009
I decided to hide your guest book

15:24.011 --> 15:25.945
in a closet I found under your stairs

15:25.947 --> 15:29.333
so my husband doesn't read
any of this. Take care. Phyllis.

15:46.563 --> 15:48.100
Hello?

15:48.102 --> 15:49.758
Is Marcia there?

15:49.878 --> 15:52.137
- Who is this?
- It's Marcia's husband.

15:52.139 --> 15:55.574
I checked the phone bill online
and saw she called this number.

15:55.576 --> 15:58.764
Is she there? I just
wanna tell her I love her.

15:58.884 --> 16:00.713
Please.

16:02.539 --> 16:04.216
Hold on.

16:13.561 --> 16:17.162
Oh, for shit's sake.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.485
Hey, Big Love.

16:20.487 --> 16:23.188
One of your wives just stole a car.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.489
Hello?

16:36.436 --> 16:38.370
No sign of forced entry.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.106
Are you sure you didn't leave
the keys in the Escalade?

16:41.108 --> 16:44.175
Positive. I left it right
there on that table.

16:44.177 --> 16:47.275
Someone must have
walked in and took 'em.

16:47.395 --> 16:49.347
Phyllis, you were up longer than us.

16:49.349 --> 16:50.815
Did you lock the door?

16:50.817 --> 16:53.482
Oh, yeah, sure. Front
door locked real tight.

16:53.602 --> 16:56.087
Back door, always open.

16:56.089 --> 16:59.657
Isn't that right, officer? You
know what I'm talking about.

16:59.659 --> 17:01.126
- Really?
- Hmm?

17:01.128 --> 17:03.428
Now? You decide to start drinking now?

17:03.430 --> 17:05.195
That's for us.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.598
I ordered a cab to take us
to the rental car place.

17:07.601 --> 17:09.256
- David, I don't mind driving you.
- No, you...

17:09.376 --> 17:11.069
Oh. You've done enough.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.271
Thank you, John, for an amazing weekend.

17:13.272 --> 17:15.973
I'm... I'm sorry, David.
I mean, trust me.

17:15.976 --> 17:19.210
My wife's the jinx in
this family, not me.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.912
What did you say?

17:20.914 --> 17:23.848
You know it's true.
You're a drama magnet.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.553
Hey, David.

17:28.555 --> 17:31.890
You're gonna wanna take a
couple drinks for the road

17:31.892 --> 17:33.629
'cause you're gonna wanna
be real nice and lubed up

17:33.749 --> 17:36.086
when you find out that that
your monkey-brained child bride

17:36.206 --> 17:38.185
is probably pregnant
'cause her birth control

17:38.305 --> 17:40.765
was in her purse that got stolen.

17:40.767 --> 17:42.901
Mm. Mm. Oh, wait.

17:42.903 --> 17:47.605
And what birth control
would that be? Hmm.

17:47.607 --> 17:49.841
Well let's just go ahead and say

17:49.843 --> 17:51.609
she wasn't using Plan A.

17:51.611 --> 17:54.779
Isn't that right? That's right, David.

17:54.781 --> 17:56.548
Every time you finish

17:56.550 --> 17:59.484
pumping and wheezing on top
of your barely legal spouse,

17:59.486 --> 18:02.854
she just pops one of
those handy dandy little

18:02.856 --> 18:05.256
no-muss, no-fuss abortion pills.

18:05.258 --> 18:08.393
Hey, what... what do you
think your little right-wing,

18:08.395 --> 18:11.262
bass guitar-playing buddy
would think about that? Huh?

18:11.264 --> 18:14.065
What do ya think, you bald, alcoholic,

18:14.067 --> 18:18.102
halitosis-having, cheap
wristwatch-wearing

18:18.104 --> 18:19.647
piece of shit?

18:19.767 --> 18:23.274
Borderline pedophile...
What... what do you think?

18:24.077 --> 18:25.502
The pill gives me whiskers.

18:25.622 --> 18:27.621
- I look like a catfish.
- Bethany,

18:28.064 --> 18:30.815
we'll talk about it in the car.

18:35.088 --> 18:37.188
I probably shouldn't have drunk.

Hi.

19:34.481 --> 19:37.082
I'm here to pick up the
keys to Froggy Cottage.

19:37.084 --> 19:39.026
My husband usually handles that.

19:39.146 --> 19:41.051
I don't know where he done got off to.

19:41.171 --> 19:43.254
But I can help you,
though. Nice place...

19:43.374 --> 19:45.437
Some jackass pissed in the kitchen,

19:45.557 --> 19:48.575
but I mopped it up. They
left an awful lot of liquor, too.

19:48.695 --> 19:51.169
- You can help yourself if you like.
- Oh, no, thanks.

19:51.289 --> 19:54.949
I'm up here so my girlfriend
can get to know my daughter.

19:55.069 --> 19:58.169
Probably not the best time
to impair our judgment.

20:06.829 --> 20:08.635
Phyllis? It's Marcia.

20:08.755 --> 20:11.123
Listen, sorry about
the car. I-I got hungry,

20:11.243 --> 20:13.780
so I grabbed the keys from
inside and I went looking for food.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.891
But then a bee flew in the
car, and I drove it into the lake.

20:17.011 --> 20:20.053
I managed to swim to shore, but
the Escalade sunk to the bottom.

20:20.173 --> 20:22.165
Get off the highway, you stupid bitch!

20:22.285 --> 20:24.274
You! You get off the
highway, you stupid bitch!

20:24.394 --> 20:26.777
Anyway, I've decided to
hitchhike back home.

20:26.779 --> 20:28.494
I'm just... I'm no good on my own.

20:28.514 --> 20:30.815
And if the insurance company
needs to get in touch with me,

20:30.817 --> 20:33.502
my number's 7-4...

20:33.622 --> 20:35.601
... 3-8. Take care!
