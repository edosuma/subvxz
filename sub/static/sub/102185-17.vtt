So how did
the Godspeeds recover so fast,

24:18.718 --> 24:20.763
let alone recharge themselves?

24:20.807 --> 24:23.505
It's like they got stronger
all of a sudden.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.594
- I think I know how.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.074
Okay, so the S.E.E. battery

24:27.117 --> 24:29.729
needed 700 nanometers
of microwave energy

24:29.772 --> 24:31.295
to power the device,

24:31.339 --> 24:33.297
but the battery wasn't charged
by Allegra.

24:33.341 --> 24:35.386
It was charged with...
- My lightning.

24:35.430 --> 24:39.260
- Which was equivalent to
5 billion nanometers of energy.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.828
- So Barry's lightning
supercharged the S.E.E.

24:41.871 --> 24:43.612
- Yeah, when the Godspeeds
were blasted,

24:43.656 --> 24:46.485
they got a super dose of
your Speed Force energy too.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.356
Barry, I am so sorry.

24:48.399 --> 24:50.445
Look, I should have seen
this coming, and I--

24:50.489 --> 24:51.794
- No, man.
No.

24:51.838 --> 24:53.709
You did everything right.
This is not your fault.

24:53.753 --> 24:57.365
- Okay, so how long
until the next batch shows up?

24:57.408 --> 24:59.019
- 45 minutes tops.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.761
But I'll see if I can get
my Pops' device

25:01.804 --> 25:02.892
working again before then.

25:02.936 --> 25:05.025
- Yeah.
- Okay.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.683
-
What are you thinking?

25:10.726 --> 25:12.380
- Even if we get
the S.E.E. working,

25:12.423 --> 25:13.686
we're still outnumbered.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.602
We need reinforcements.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.517
- Hell to the yeah you do.

25:20.823 --> 25:22.477
-
- How long were you listening?

25:22.521 --> 25:24.000
- Not long.
Not long.

25:24.044 --> 25:26.394
I mean, just long enough
to hear that Dad

25:26.437 --> 25:28.918
finally realized
that he should tag me in.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.659
- He meant me, dumbass.

25:30.703 --> 25:34.228
- No, I didn't.
- Wait, what?

25:34.271 --> 25:36.709
- Nora,
we almost died out there.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.058
I couldn't protect you.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.450
I'm not putting you
in that position again.

25:39.494 --> 25:42.149
- Yeah, but we didn't die,
and I can help.

25:42.192 --> 25:43.716
Mom, a little backup
here, please?

25:43.759 --> 25:44.978
- Nora,
this war is unpredictable,

25:45.021 --> 25:46.501
and it's getting
more dangerous.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.937
- What do you think
Bart and I deal with

25:47.981 --> 25:49.591
every day in 2049?

25:49.635 --> 25:50.810
- Yeah, come on.
We're heroes.

25:50.853 --> 25:52.463
Dangerous is, like,
kind of part of the job.

25:52.507 --> 25:53.639
- Not this time.

25:53.682 --> 25:56.380
- You don't
just get to decide that.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.947
I'm about to turn 30.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.516
In four years.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.344
The point is, unlike Bart,

26:03.387 --> 26:04.737
I'm the real adult.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.739
- We're your parents,
and we're saying right now

26:06.782 --> 26:07.870
you're still
not going out there.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.611
- You can't stop me
from fighting.

26:09.655 --> 26:10.656
- Okay.
Me either.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.483
Mom?

26:12.527 --> 26:13.789
- Your father is right.

26:13.833 --> 26:16.618
- Well, you can't just
send us back to 2049.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.054
That's not an option,

26:18.098 --> 26:20.622
and we're not gonna go
watch TV at Grandpa Joe's.

in a pipeline cell

26:22.058 --> 26:23.582

You've been blasting
ultraviolet light,

27:08.931 --> 27:11.325
As far as I know,

27:11.368 --> 27:15.677
you only hit that range from
channeling negative emotions,

27:15.721 --> 27:18.898
like anger or pain.

27:20.726 --> 27:24.120
Allegra, what's going on?

27:24.164 --> 27:26.514
- Nothing.

27:27.558 --> 27:30.823
- Before,
you said you nuked your coffee.

27:30.866 --> 27:32.825
It was ice cold.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.957
And then you called me Chester.

27:35.001 --> 27:37.351
You never call me Chester.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.749
Did you get in a fight
with Esperanza?

27:43.792 --> 27:47.274
'Cause you can
always patch that up.

27:47.317 --> 27:48.623
- Not this time...

27:51.757 --> 27:53.236

27:56.762 --> 27:58.981

It's mine.

28:05.074 --> 28:07.033
Esperanza was my family,

28:07.076 --> 28:10.471
and I should have been there
for her.

28:10.514 --> 28:13.474
Just like I should be able
to charge this stupid thing,

28:13.517 --> 28:14.997
but I can't.

28:15.041 --> 28:17.696
And now, more people
are gonna get hurt,

28:17.739 --> 28:18.958
and it's all my fault.

28:19.001 --> 28:20.960
- It's not...

28:32.449 --> 28:35.496
- This whole parenting thing
is different this time around.

28:35.539 --> 28:36.889
- Yeah, I know.

28:38.194 --> 28:40.980
I always knew our kids
would have a hard life

28:41.023 --> 28:45.114
being speedsters,
but I never thought

28:45.158 --> 28:47.508
they'd have to deal
with a Thawne of their own.

28:50.032 --> 28:52.252
It's like there's
a curse on our family.

28:54.602 --> 28:57.083
I mean, tragedy
follows us everywhere.

28:58.301 --> 29:00.086
Maybe that's our real legacy.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.263
- You don't believe that.

29:05.134 --> 29:08.485
- This all started
the night Thawne killed my mom,

29:08.529 --> 29:10.183
and I might not know
where he is now,

29:10.226 --> 29:12.881

29:12.925 --> 29:14.448
And in the other timeline,

29:14.491 --> 29:17.277
Nora's Godspeed killed
her best friend, Lia.

29:17.320 --> 29:21.455
And now, I think this Godspeed
killed someone Bart loved.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.416
History's repeating itself.

29:36.731 --> 29:37.950
Iris, if we beat

29:37.993 --> 29:41.257
the Godspeed clones here,
in 2021,

29:41.301 --> 29:43.477
the real August Heart
will never get his powers back.

29:43.520 --> 29:47.002
- Which means that when Nora
and Bart go back to 2049,

29:47.046 --> 29:50.136
there won't be a Godspeed
there to endanger them.

29:50.179 --> 29:52.051

29:56.664 --> 29:58.797

37:25.504 --> 37:29.247
- So you gonna talk about it?

37:29.290 --> 37:30.509
- Talk about what?

37:30.552 --> 37:32.424
- That Creyke said
that he saw you die.

37:32.467 --> 37:34.339
- Just drop it, West.

37:35.470 --> 37:38.386
I spent years
letting Adam haunt me

37:38.430 --> 37:39.953
for the pain that he caused,

37:39.996 --> 37:41.520
the lives he took.

37:44.218 --> 37:45.785
Now I can put it behind me

37:45.828 --> 37:47.917
and get back to doing my job.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.357
- My God.

37:57.231 --> 37:58.580
- What the hell?

37:58.624 --> 38:00.800
- Looks like the whole city's
trying to leave town.

38:02.584 --> 38:04.282
Kramer, watch out!

38:09.896 --> 38:11.463
Oh!

38:12.551 --> 38:13.943
- That was close.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.570
<i>- As soon
as I flip the collider,</i>

38:31.613 --> 38:33.833
your synaptic pathways
will open,

38:33.876 --> 38:36.966
and then Ms. Horton will guide
your consciousness into his.

38:38.011 --> 38:39.273
- Don't worry.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.362
I am gonna be right here
with you the whole time.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.540
- Barry, I know

38:45.584 --> 38:47.499
this August Heart
seems harmless,

38:47.542 --> 38:50.980
but the real August Heart is
locked away inside of his mind.

38:51.764 --> 38:55.420
From what we know--
- He's a monster.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.466
- Be careful.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.601
- The collider's primed.

39:04.254 --> 39:05.560
- Ms. Horton?

39:07.345 --> 39:09.434
- I'm ready.

39:19.487 --> 39:20.619
Yeah.

39:25.493 --> 39:26.886
August?

39:28.453 --> 39:31.238
If you're not comfortable with
this, you don't have to do it.

39:33.196 --> 39:34.676
- It's okay.

39:36.199 --> 39:39.420
I need to know who I am,

39:39.464 --> 39:41.944
even if it's someone I despise.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.208
- Yeah.

39:46.471 --> 39:49.169
Okay.

39:58.918 --> 40:01.399
- Barry's synapses
are ready for transference.

40:06.882 --> 40:09.842

we can't all be overachievers.
