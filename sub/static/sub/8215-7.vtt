WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.995
*

00:34.100 --> 00:34.794
Stop playing with
your collar.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.263
This new shirt
is too tight--

00:36.300 --> 00:37.494
I can't breathe.

00:37.530 --> 00:38.724
Can you fit
your finger in there?
Yeah.

00:38.770 --> 00:39.896
Well, then,
it's not too tight.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.635
What, did you memorize
some Esquire article?

00:41.670 --> 00:43.809
: No.
Six months,

00:43.840 --> 00:46.434
assistant floor manager
at Tuxedo World,

00:46.480 --> 00:48.107
Albuquerque, 2007.

00:48.140 --> 00:49.107
No way, come on.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.778
View your tuxedo
as an investment,

00:51.810 --> 00:52.777
that will guide you

00:52.820 --> 00:54.173
through formal events

00:54.220 --> 00:55.812
for years to come.

00:55.850 --> 00:57.386
Shall I go on?

00:57.420 --> 00:58.489
WOMAN:
Name?

00:58.520 --> 00:59.714
Carrie Wells, Al Burns.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.079
Right here.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.554
Great. Please fill out
a name tag.

01:03.590 --> 01:05.228
You got a pen?

01:05.260 --> 01:06.750
Uh... sorry.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.358
Someone must've grabbed it
and run off.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.129
Oh, well, we're cops,
we'll find them and arrest them.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.592
Oh, you don't
have to do that.

01:11.630 --> 01:13.359
I got it.

01:14.900 --> 01:15.639
Too cool for a name tag?

01:15.670 --> 01:18.104
Yeah. I'm too cool
for a name tag.

01:18.140 --> 01:19.539
Name tags are
designed to make

01:19.580 --> 01:20.706
other people
feel comfortable,

01:20.740 --> 01:22.207
so they can
come up and talk to you.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.605
I want everyone to feel
really uncomfortable,

01:24.650 --> 01:25.844
so that they don't
talk to me at all.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.814
Nice dress.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.286
You know, you act like

01:31.320 --> 01:32.582
you don't like
these charity things

01:32.620 --> 01:34.110
Eliot invites us to,

01:34.160 --> 01:36.128
but I think secretly,
you love them.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.458
You know what I love?

01:38.490 --> 01:42.165
Ooh... are these little
sandwichy things.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.519
Hmm.
WOMAN:
Champagne?

01:44.870 --> 01:46.167
ELIOT:
Carrie,

01:46.200 --> 01:47.565
Al, I'm so glad
you could make it.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.828
I would like to
Introduce you

01:48.870 --> 01:50.428
to my wife Shelby.

01:50.470 --> 01:52.779
It is a pleasure
to finally meet you.

01:52.810 --> 01:53.879
Likewise.

01:53.910 --> 01:55.605
Eliot's told me
so much about you.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.675
All good things, I hope.

01:56.710 --> 01:58.246
Glowing reviews.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.611
Really!
ELIOT:
One of the many things

01:59.650 --> 02:00.719
I love about Shelby:

02:00.750 --> 02:03.287
discretion is a quality
she holds in high regard.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.885
Well, not the only trait
I've had to acquire

02:06.920 --> 02:08.558
being married for 15 years.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.353
MAN: Shelby and Eliot.
ELIOT: There he is.

02:10.390 --> 02:12.199
Well, now the party
can really begin.

02:12.230 --> 02:14.528
Hi.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.822
Lieutenant Al Burns.

02:15.860 --> 02:16.861
Detective Carrie Wells.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.322
I'd like you to meet

02:18.370 --> 02:19.860
Manhattan Borough President
Robert Bright.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.834
Well, it's an honor
to have you.

02:21.870 --> 02:23.201
You're boss and I
go way back.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.730
Yeah, we were
once called "young punks"

02:24.770 --> 02:27.170
in the mayor's office,
back in the day.

02:27.210 --> 02:28.438
Wow, "punk"
is not a word

02:28.480 --> 02:29.708
I would associate
with Eliot.

02:29.750 --> 02:30.899
I have pictures.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.315
ELIOT:
Where's O'Bannon?

02:32.350 --> 02:33.612
I haven't seen him.

02:33.650 --> 02:34.776
Oh, my loyal Chief of Staff

02:34.820 --> 02:35.673
is already
working the floor.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.779
It's all hands on deck,
till the primary.

02:37.820 --> 02:40.653
Oh, if I haven't said:
Bob's running for mayor.

02:40.690 --> 02:42.749
Yeah, I've heard:
"For a brighter future."

02:42.790 --> 02:43.882
Catchy.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.227
Couldn't resist it, right?

02:45.260 --> 02:46.454
WOMAN:
Excuse me.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.492
Bob-- Debby Ellenson
from tRﬁ Times

02:49.530 --> 02:51.589
wants five minutes
and they're gonna need you

02:51.630 --> 02:53.734
up on the dais
pretty soon.
Okay, thanks.

02:53.770 --> 02:56.659
So, uh, remind me to
show you those photos later.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.405
Diamond stud, left ear.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.237
Won't you just go.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.305
It was the '905,
all right?

03:03.350 --> 03:04.647
ELIOT:
Aah, there's O'Bannon.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.478
Um, if you'll excuse me.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.817
AL:
Your husband can
work a room,

03:08.850 --> 03:09.987
that's for sure.

03:10.020 --> 03:12.750
Yes, he can.

03:12.790 --> 03:14.655
It was a pleasure
to meet you two.

03:14.690 --> 03:15.987
The reviews really

03:16.020 --> 03:18.386
are glowing;
I didn't just say that.

03:18.430 --> 03:21.319
Way to go, Eliot.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.499
Hmm!

03:23.530 --> 03:27.330
So, you got no one
to talk to, O'Bannon?

03:27.370 --> 03:28.735
It's good to see you, Eliot.

03:28.770 --> 03:29.759
It's been a while.

03:29.810 --> 03:30.834
I know, I know.

03:30.870 --> 03:32.770
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry about,
uh, lunch last month,

03:32.810 --> 03:35.005
like, the office
kind of blew up on me.
Yeah.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.246
I get it.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.542
You're a busy man
these days.

03:37.580 --> 03:38.842
Yeah, yeah.
You, too.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.017
How's the campaign going?

03:40.050 --> 03:41.870
Is Bright totally
insufferable yet?

03:41.920 --> 03:43.410
It's, uh...

03:43.450 --> 03:44.917
Long hours,
lots of handshakes.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.885
He lives for it.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.559
As many of you know,
I'm Marcia Harrison,

03:50.590 --> 03:52.626
co-chair for today's event.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.026
MARCIA: This organization
means a great deal

03:55.060 --> 03:57.597
You okay?
to the City of New York...

03:57.630 --> 03:58.619
Yeah.

03:58.670 --> 03:59.762
I'm fine, just, uh...

03:59.800 --> 04:01.734
just been thinking
about some stuff.

04:03.710 --> 04:04.938
You know what? I'll call you.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.039
We'll catch up.

04:06.070 --> 04:08.709
Yeah, yeah,
let's do that.

04:08.740 --> 04:10.298
MARCIA:
Okay, enough from me.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.818
It's my honor
to introduce to you

04:12.850 --> 04:15.011
my co-chair
for today's festivities,

04:15.050 --> 04:16.779
Manhattan Borough President

04:16.820 --> 04:19.459
and currently a candidate
for something, I hear...

04:20.490 --> 04:22.720
...Mr. Robert Bright.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.954
BRIGHT:
Thank you, Marcia

04:23.990 --> 04:25.548
and thank you, all,
for being here.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.057
Listen, I'm not one to

04:27.100 --> 04:28.954
count my chickens
before they hatch, but...

04:29.000 --> 04:30.627
once they do hatch,

04:30.670 --> 04:32.490
I do plan to ask them
for their votes.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.829
Oh, where is that champagne
when you need it?

04:36.870 --> 04:38.007
Oh!
There you go.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.029
Thank you.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.970
See? All done

04:41.010 --> 04:43.069
and plenty
of daylight left.
Yes!

04:43.110 --> 04:44.543
What do you
want to do?
I don't know.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.002
How about we go get
some real food?

04:46.050 --> 04:47.347
Pretzel dog
from Monte's?

04:47.380 --> 04:48.142
A pret... really?

04:48.180 --> 04:50.387
Have you seen
the way I'm dressed?

04:51.850 --> 04:53.579
Whoa.
Hold that thought.

04:56.090 --> 04:58.058
OFFICER:
Folks, NYPD. Clear the way.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.576
AL:
That's Dave O'Bannon.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.065
Okay, so, I found three wounds,

05:41.100 --> 05:42.658
two of them superficial:

05:42.710 --> 05:44.666
One to the left hand,
one to the wrist,

05:44.710 --> 05:46.405
probably defending himself.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.499
The one on his neck

05:48.540 --> 05:50.098
slashed his carotid artery;

05:50.150 --> 05:51.970
probably would have
bled out in minutes.

05:52.010 --> 05:53.671
Time of death?
It's preliminary,

05:53.720 --> 05:54.948
but the temperature
would indicate

05:54.980 --> 05:56.481
maybe an hour ago.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.681
That would place the murder
around 3:00 pm.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.859
I'll know more
when I get back to the lab.

06:04.460 --> 06:05.654
How's he doing?

06:05.690 --> 06:07.521
Mostly on the phone
with Dave's wife;

06:07.560 --> 06:09.391
arrangements and stuff.

06:09.430 --> 06:10.761
The Three Amigos.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.563
Dave, Eliot
and Bright,

06:12.600 --> 06:14.431
that's what we called them
back in the '905.

06:14.470 --> 06:16.734
If you wanted anything
from City Hall,

06:16.770 --> 06:18.169
you had to go through them.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.178
It was not fun.

06:20.210 --> 06:21.529
I'm sorry,
Detectives.

06:21.580 --> 06:22.239
Mr. Bright
had to cancel his

06:22.280 --> 06:23.770
campaign event
for tonight.

06:23.810 --> 06:24.845
But_he had some
constituent meetings

06:24.880 --> 06:26.541
in his office.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.616
So, he'll be available
to talk with you ASAP.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.447
Anything I can do.

06:30.490 --> 06:31.787
This is awful.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.708
CARRIE:
Thanks.
JO:
I'll let you know

06:33.760 --> 06:35.614
as soon as I have
more Information.
Thank you.

06:35.660 --> 06:37.025
Yeah, of course.

06:37.060 --> 06:38.618
Yep.

06:38.660 --> 06:40.890
Love to the kids.

06:40.930 --> 06:43.069
It's Dave's wife, Gina.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.692
Their son's in Spain,

06:44.730 --> 06:46.789
but their daughter Kara's
coming in from Kenyon

06:46.840 --> 06:48.068
tonight-- Oh, my God.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.533
Shelby's gonna be devastated.

06:49.570 --> 06:51.208
Eliot, is there anything
you can tell us

06:51.240 --> 06:52.571
that might help us
solve this?

06:52.610 --> 06:54.532
I-I didn't see him that much.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.070
I, um...

06:56.110 --> 06:57.600
I canceled lunch last month

06:57.650 --> 06:58.969
for no good reason.

06:59.010 --> 07:01.547
I did talk to him,
uh, before the speeches.

07:01.580 --> 07:04.185
He had a few, but, uh...

07:04.220 --> 07:05.983
that was standard operating
for Dave.

07:06.020 --> 07:08.011
He did, though, seem...

07:08.060 --> 07:10.528
kind of preoccupied.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.549
: I don't know,

07:11.590 --> 07:13.490
25 years, you know...
it's, uh,

07:13.530 --> 07:14.952
he was best man at my wedding.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.490
He and Brighty flipped for it.

07:16.530 --> 07:19.636
Eliot, if you need to
take some time...

07:19.670 --> 07:21.661
Yeah, I don't...

07:21.700 --> 07:23.930
: I don't know
how much good I can do here.

07:23.970 --> 07:25.005
Ijust, uh...

07:25.040 --> 07:26.632
We're gonna find who did this.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.772
You know that, don't you?

07:27.810 --> 07:29.038
I do.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.206
Thanks.

07:34.250 --> 07:35.569
MURRAY:
Okay. Thanks.

07:35.620 --> 07:38.544
Hey, so, there's no signs
of forced entry--

07:38.590 --> 07:41.013
both the door
and the lock are intact.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.948
What about hotel employees
with keycards?

07:42.990 --> 07:44.855
Yeah, I already ran down
anyone who would've

07:44.890 --> 07:46.528
legitimately had access
to this room.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.720
The ones who weren't working

07:47.760 --> 07:49.523
the event on the roof

07:49.570 --> 07:50.923
at the time of death
have alibis.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.631
So Dave knows his killer,
lets him in?

07:52.670 --> 07:53.295
That'd be my guess.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.693
_ AL:
All right, get whatever

07:54.740 --> 07:55.434
security footage
the hotel has.

07:55.470 --> 07:56.266
I want to know
everyone who even

07:56.300 --> 07:57.801
walked by this room today.

07:57.840 --> 07:58.932
Okay.

08:01.780 --> 08:05.102
CARRIE:
Al, take a look at this Sterno.

08:05.150 --> 08:06.242
Something was burned in here.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.077
We should have CSU bag it.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.712
AL:
No sign of his keys,

08:09.750 --> 08:10.785
but his wallet is right here.

08:10.820 --> 08:12.117
This wasn't about money.

08:12.150 --> 08:14.254
Well, it was
about something.

08:14.290 --> 08:16.053
There were a lot of people
at the fund-raiser.

08:16.090 --> 08:17.728
A lot of powerful people.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.784
And those powerful people

08:18.830 --> 08:21.697
are now our suspects.

08:25.970 --> 08:27.232
BRIGHT:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

08:27.270 --> 08:29.830
No one can believe it.

08:29.870 --> 08:31.064
How's Eliot doing?

08:31.110 --> 08:32.737
Okay, considering.

08:32.780 --> 08:35.135
Yeah. The crazy thing is,
I keep...

08:35.180 --> 08:37.978
looking around for Dave to calm
everyone down.

08:38.010 --> 08:39.910
We just have a couple
of questions, and a copy
of the guest list

08:39.950 --> 08:41.918
from today's event
would be helpful.

08:41.950 --> 08:45.545
Of course. Don, uh, could you
pull a copy of the guest list

08:45.590 --> 08:46.887
from the Clean Air thing
for the detectives here?

08:46.920 --> 08:48.649
Sure thing.
Thanks.

08:48.690 --> 08:50.954
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.958
One second.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.797
Yes?

08:54.830 --> 08:57.765
Wonderful. Just have it
delivered to the house.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.961
Thank you.
Something like this happens,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.003
hard to give a damn
about a-a rug delivery.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.928
So, you had
some questions.

09:04.970 --> 09:07.609
Yeah, we wanted to get a sense
of Dave in the workplace,

09:07.640 --> 09:09.335
you know, how he was
with his coworkers.

09:09.380 --> 09:12.747
Were there any issues
you might want to tell us about?

09:12.780 --> 09:15.010
The guy ran
a very friendly ship-- just...

09:15.050 --> 09:16.119
calm, calm, calm.

09:16.150 --> 09:17.879
That was his thing.

09:17.920 --> 09:21.048
Which, you know, is surprising,
given where he came from.

09:21.090 --> 09:23.024
What do you mean?
I don't
know how much

09:23.060 --> 09:27.099
Eliot told you about us, but we
were kind of an unlikely trio.

09:27.130 --> 09:29.724
I was Upper East Side
all the way.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.021
Dalton, Princeton.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.265
Eliot got ahead
by his brains, right?

09:33.300 --> 09:35.894
But Dave, he was a street kid.

09:35.940 --> 09:38.738
Yeah, Valentine Ave.,
off Grand Concourse; he...

09:38.770 --> 09:41.807
started as an errand boy
for Koch when he was 21.
Eliot mentioned

09:41.840 --> 09:43.046
Dave was upset
at the fund-raiser.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.377
Do you have any idea why?

09:44.410 --> 09:45.968
Eliot said that?

09:46.010 --> 09:47.978
That's funny.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.217
I remember thinking he was
a little distracted lately, too,

09:51.250 --> 09:53.252
just a feeling I got, you know?

09:53.290 --> 09:55.884
The past few weeks, he'd get
up in the middle of meetings

09:55.920 --> 09:57.182
to take personal calls.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.219
Never did that before.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.228
Yeah.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.168
Sorry.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.088
I, uh,

10:05.130 --> 10:06.836
got everyone waiting
for a statement.

10:06.870 --> 10:08.963
So...

10:09.000 --> 10:10.900
Thank you.
We're good for now.

10:10.940 --> 10:12.009
Thanks, guys.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.632
Uh, Don will get you
that invite list

10:13.680 --> 10:15.079
on your way out.

10:15.110 --> 10:16.907
Okay.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.669
Dave's wife
can see us now.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.812
CARRIE: _
He's just too sllck.

10:20.850 --> 10:22.909
His dear friend
is murdered,

10:22.950 --> 10:25.646
what, a few hours ago and he's
already back here working it.

10:25.690 --> 10:27.988
Well, someone's got
to rally the troops.

10:28.020 --> 10:30.250
I think we should
check his alibi.

10:32.430 --> 10:35.126
And then, this is
the three of them

10:35.160 --> 10:37.390
with the councilman,
I think,

10:37.430 --> 10:39.022
dedicating some memorial
in the park.

10:39.070 --> 10:41.789
God, Bob looks so young.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.035
I remember Dave
forgot his tie.

10:44.070 --> 10:46.777
Eliot lent him
that one, I think.
AL: Gina...

10:46.810 --> 10:49.938
was your husband particularly
upset about anything recently?

10:49.980 --> 10:51.345
Either at work
or in his personal life?

10:51.380 --> 10:53.814
No.

10:53.850 --> 10:55.442
He... he was a little down

10:55.480 --> 10:58.847
with both of the kids
being away, but...

10:58.890 --> 11:02.883
we were gonna do some traveling
after the election.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.956
Maybe even moving someplace
a little warmer.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.390
He wasn't planning to stay
with Bright if he won?

11:08.430 --> 11:10.159
No...

11:10.200 --> 11:13.089
The whole power thing
never meant too much to Dave.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.960
That's more Bob.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.763
And Eliot.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.199
Dave just liked helping
out his friend.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.332
He thought Bright
would make a good mayor.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.802
You agree?

11:21.840 --> 11:24.400
Yeah, you know...

11:24.450 --> 11:27.749
at that level you gotta
make a lot of compromises.

11:27.780 --> 11:30.112
The higher you go,
the harder they get.

11:30.150 --> 11:32.914
At least,
I know Dave felt that way.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.110
Were there any compromises
in particular that bothered him?

11:35.160 --> 11:36.821
No.

11:36.860 --> 11:39.920
But I could tell
something was on his mind.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.349
When he was in a bad mood,

11:42.400 --> 11:45.927
he would take out
this map of California,

11:45.970 --> 11:48.188
and start looking at towns

11:48.240 --> 11:51.334
out in the desert.

11:51.370 --> 11:54.771
: I saw a lot of the
desert these past few weeks.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.343
Okay.

12:00.380 --> 12:03.144
Thank you.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.942
And if you think
of anything else...

12:12.330 --> 12:14.298
in the photo on the right-hand
side, with your husband?

12:14.330 --> 12:15.456
Who

12:15.500 --> 12:17.320
Oh, Dec McCauley.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.190
Declan, he's a,

12:19.230 --> 12:21.266
he's a friend from
back in the day.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.030
He and Dave hauled trash with
the Brooklyn Hauling Association

12:24.070 --> 12:25.537
when Dave was
just out of high school.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.003
Wow, that's rough work.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.177
Yeah.

12:28.210 --> 12:29.404
But Dave always said

12:29.440 --> 12:31.271
it was the best job he ever had.

12:32.380 --> 12:34.041
Oh...

12:34.080 --> 12:35.547
EXCUSE me.

12:35.580 --> 12:39.118
Dave's sister.

12:39.150 --> 12:40.788
CARRIE:
He was at the fund-raiser.

12:40.820 --> 12:42.549
Really?

12:42.590 --> 12:44.228
Doesn't seem like
his kind of thing.

12:44.260 --> 12:47.229
No. No, it doesn't.

12:47.260 --> 12:51.196
Declan McCauley, president of
the BHA for the past two years.

12:51.230 --> 12:52.868
And by Brooklyn
Hauling Association,

12:52.900 --> 12:54.265
what we're
really talking about here

12:54.300 --> 12:55.232
is the Irish Mob.
Hmm.

12:55.270 --> 12:56.908
Now, officially,
the BHA controls

12:56.940 --> 12:58.498
most of the private
trash-hauling contracts

12:58.540 --> 13:00.269
in Brooklyn and the Bronx.

13:00.310 --> 13:03.177
He wasn't on the guest list,
so what was he doing there?

13:03.210 --> 13:05.075
Maybe the McCauleys
are looking to get their hooks

13:05.110 --> 13:06.372
into power brokers at the event?

13:06.410 --> 13:08.378
And they figure...

13:08.420 --> 13:10.513
they could use Dave
to make the introductions.

13:10.550 --> 13:13.155
Dave O'Bannon is no
friend of the Mob.

13:13.190 --> 13:14.157
As far as you know.

13:14.190 --> 13:15.179
I know Dave.
Okay,

13:15.220 --> 13:16.881
but, right now,
a reputed Mob boss

13:16.930 --> 13:18.818
_ is our best_ lead
In the Investigation

13:18.860 --> 13:20.828
of his murder.
I think we should follow

13:20.860 --> 13:22.157
that lead.

13:23.630 --> 13:26.292
Of course. You're right.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.307
We're here to talk
about Dave O'Bannon.

13:32.340 --> 13:34.035
Heartbreaking is what that is.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.968
We're hoping you could
tell us what went on

13:36.010 --> 13:37.477
between the two of you
at that fund-raiser.

13:37.510 --> 13:38.875
Nothing went on.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.548
He invited me and I went.

13:40.580 --> 13:42.070
You got a copy
of that invitation?

13:42.120 --> 13:43.109
'Cause you're not
on the guest list.

13:43.150 --> 13:44.219
So, stuff falls through

13:44.250 --> 13:46.218
the cracks, I guess.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.081
I'll tell you what--
I'll look for it.
You and Dave

13:48.120 --> 13:48.950
have been friendly for
a number of years.

13:48.990 --> 13:49.979
Is that right?

13:50.030 --> 13:51.327
Since he was a kid.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.954
Came to work
for my uncle in 1986.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.399
And you stayed in
touch ever since?

13:55.430 --> 13:56.920
I'd see him at family things.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.119
You know, talked
to him at the holidays.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.228
Stuff like that.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.532
And that was it?

14:00.570 --> 14:03.061
You want a bite?

14:03.110 --> 14:06.568
It's tough to get a nice,
dry-aged rib eye these days.

14:10.150 --> 14:13.347
You know where it's really hard
to get a dry

14:13.380 --> 14:14.574
Dannemora State Prison.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.144
Mr. McCauley,

14:16.180 --> 14:19.115
everyone knows the Brooklyn
Hauling Association

14:19.150 --> 14:21.380
owns half the private
trash contracts

14:21.420 --> 14:22.614
in the five boroughs,
and that you keep

14:22.660 --> 14:24.127
those contract prices down

14:24.160 --> 14:25.320
by discouraging landlords

14:25.360 --> 14:27.157
from asking for more.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.226
Thing is, what some
call "discouraging,"

14:30.270 --> 14:33.990
the law calls extortion,
bribery and felonious assault.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.100
Now, we may look the
other way, because hey,

14:37.140 --> 14:39.563
somebody's picking up
our garbage.

14:39.610 --> 14:43.171
But that could change
very fast.

14:46.050 --> 14:47.608
Look.

14:47.650 --> 14:50.084
The BHA and Dave,
we did things old-school.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.042
We had an arrangement.

14:52.090 --> 14:53.614
I see a contract
comes available

14:53.660 --> 14:57.027
in the city, I contact Dave,
he makes some calls.

14:57.060 --> 15:00.598
That's the way business has been
run for 150 years in this city.

15:00.630 --> 15:03.064
You were paying him
to steer contracts your way?

15:03.100 --> 15:04.089
Paying him?

15:04.130 --> 15:05.392
Right.

15:05.430 --> 15:08.035
O'Bannon never took
a dime in his life.

15:08.070 --> 15:10.163
I mean, not a turkey
for this guy on Christmas.

15:12.170 --> 15:13.376
It was about taking care
of family.

15:13.410 --> 15:16.106
Which is why bailing on me
made no sense.

15:16.140 --> 15:18.040
So, he wanted
out of this arrangement?

15:18.080 --> 15:19.104
He told me it was over.

15:19.150 --> 15:22.210
I had to start
bidding jobs public

15:22.250 --> 15:24.218
like some punk or something.
I didn't know what was going on.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.115
So I went there today
to talk to him.

15:26.150 --> 15:28.289
I mean, I know
the guy a long time.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.527
He was in his head going on
about tough choices,

15:30.560 --> 15:32.050
doing the right thing.

15:32.090 --> 15:33.648
Honestly, I figured
it was the booze talking,

15:33.700 --> 15:35.452
so I heard him out and I left.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.127
Dave was like

15:37.170 --> 15:39.991
my kid brother--
I'd never touch him.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.338
The fact is
I got an alibi aanay.

15:42.370 --> 15:44.634
After I left the hotel,
I went to my niece's school.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.558
They're doing Riverdance.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.602
One thing, though,
Detectives.

15:52.650 --> 15:55.244
If Dave O'Bannon was working
other handshake arrangements

15:55.280 --> 15:58.511
around town with construction,

15:58.550 --> 16:01.110
heat and air, whatever,

16:01.160 --> 16:04.323
and he came over all born-again
virtuous like he done with me?

16:04.360 --> 16:06.487
I can guarantee you those folks

16:06.530 --> 16:09.158
would not show
Similar restraint.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.702
Eliot.

16:26.750 --> 16:28.638
Hi, Jo.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.012
I was just leaving.

16:31.050 --> 16:33.052
Did you...

16:33.090 --> 16:34.250
find out anything new?

16:34.290 --> 16:35.655
Not really.

16:35.690 --> 16:39.524
Except, uh, however he sustained

16:39.560 --> 16:41.790
that wound to his carotid
is definitely what killed him.

16:41.830 --> 16:43.627
Oh, and this might
be interesting.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.719
I found makeup on Dave's thumb.

16:46.770 --> 16:48.397
"Makeup"?
Yeah.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.203
I don't know what kind.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.105
I'll send it out to be analyzed.

16:52.140 --> 16:53.505
They'll figure it out.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.474
Also, I found
some partial prints

16:55.510 --> 16:57.569
in the room, but there were
no matches in the system.

16:57.610 --> 17:00.044
I, um, heard from Carrie

17:00.080 --> 17:03.083
there was some unusual substance
in a can of Sterno?

17:03.120 --> 17:04.109
That's a long shot.

17:04.150 --> 17:05.515
But we sent it
to the lab,

17:05.550 --> 17:07.654
see if they can
retrieve anything.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.385
He was a good man.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.081
Yeah, he was.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.519
I'm sorry, Eliot.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.532
I took a look at the
trash-hauling deals

17:21.570 --> 17:24.437
Dave O'Bannon was backing
out of with his pal Declan.

17:24.470 --> 17:26.267
They're for a couple of these
skinny skyscrapers

17:26.310 --> 17:27.572
being built around Central Park.

17:27.610 --> 17:28.702
They're pretty controversial

17:28.740 --> 17:30.401
because they've been approved

17:30.450 --> 17:32.543
despite the shade they're gonna
throw across the park.

17:32.580 --> 17:33.774
There's been a lot of press.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.117
"ActiV8NY."

17:35.150 --> 17:36.469
I've never heard of it.

17:36.520 --> 17:37.748
It's an online _
news serwce focusmg

17:37.790 --> 17:40.258
mostly on muckraking
in New York City.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.417
They've been running a series
of critical articles

17:42.460 --> 17:43.688
on all these buildings.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.584
Uh, cost overruns,

17:45.630 --> 17:47.598
union corruptions,
falsified

17:47.630 --> 17:49.222
environmental records.
CARRIE:
Wait a second.

17:49.260 --> 17:50.295
That woman.

17:51.130 --> 17:52.597
Champagne?

17:55.540 --> 17:57.565
Pam Lisotta. I know her.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.407
That's a pretty obscure blog.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.577
No, she was at the fund-raiser.

18:00.610 --> 18:01.804
She was waitressing.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.307
Well, maybe it's a second job.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.374
I mean, how much money
can you make

18:04.410 --> 18:05.638
working for a political blog?

18:05.680 --> 18:07.341
No, I read the staff list

18:07.380 --> 18:08.449
that Bright gave us.

18:08.480 --> 18:11.210
There was no Pam Lisotta
on that list.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.411
She mus_t've come in
under a different name.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.813
The question is why?

18:18.760 --> 18:20.648
Fine, I used a friend's
I.D. who caters

18:20.700 --> 18:22.691
at the Filmont to
get into the event.

18:22.730 --> 18:25.198
Dave O'Bannon's phone records
indicate seven incoming calls

18:25.230 --> 18:26.822
all from an unknown burner cell.

18:26.870 --> 18:29.737
Do you want to save us the time
of linking that phone to you?

18:29.770 --> 18:31.431
Okay.

18:31.470 --> 18:33.370
I was trying to get to him
That's true.

18:33.410 --> 18:35.173
It-it was for _a series
I'm writing.

18:35.210 --> 18:37.201
On the skyscrapers
around Central Park?

18:37.250 --> 18:38.706
I believe the process
of awarding building rights

18:38.750 --> 18:40.411
is being short-circuited.

18:40.450 --> 18:41.872
Someone in city government
is taking money

18:41.920 --> 18:44.639
from developers
to award construction deals.

18:44.690 --> 18:46.817
And one of Bright's duties
as Manhattan borough president

18:46.850 --> 18:50.627
is to oversee the awarding
of major construction contracts.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.525
You bet it is. And one
of Bright's major donors,

18:52.560 --> 18:54.494
Marcia Harrison,
just happens to be in line

18:54.530 --> 18:55.428
for several of those deals.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.519
So you think Bright's
using his influence

18:57.570 --> 18:59.663
as borough president
to throw contracts her way?

18:59.700 --> 19:01.668
And in exchange, she makes
significant contributions

19:01.700 --> 19:03.634
to Bright's mayoral campaign.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.501
The problem is
I had no proof.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.838
I needed a money trail,
smoking gun.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.609
I thought Dave O'Bannon
might have one.

19:09.640 --> 19:12.200
Hold on, Dave was actively
working to get Bright elected.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.342
Why would he help you?

19:13.380 --> 19:14.449
At first, he wouldn't.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.879
But I finally got
him to look around

19:15.920 --> 19:17.285
a little on his own.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.185
When he called back,
he seemed shocked.

19:19.220 --> 19:20.517
He said he'd
found something.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.652
He was willing to
share it with me.

19:21.690 --> 19:22.850
He sent me a text.

19:22.890 --> 19:23.959
Well, burn note.

19:23.990 --> 19:25.958
I took a screen shot.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.629
"Tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.,
Penn Station.

19:28.660 --> 19:30.218
I'll have what you need."

19:30.270 --> 19:31.589
Butthen".

19:31.630 --> 19:33.689
I think he lost his nerve

19:33.740 --> 19:35.560
because he stopped
returning my phone calls.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.364
So, you snuck into
the fund

19:38.410 --> 19:39.536
Yeah. But I never
had the chance.

19:39.570 --> 19:40.935
How do we know

19:40.980 --> 19:42.675
that once Dave_
stopped cooperating,

19:42.710 --> 19:44.473
you didn't just go
to his room and make him?

19:44.510 --> 19:46.341
I worked the whole party.
There was a supervisor

19:46.380 --> 19:47.779
from hell who wouldn't
let me out of his sight.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.879
You can talk to him.
I was loading out

19:49.920 --> 19:52.218
when the cops found Dave's body.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.787
JAY:
So, maybe Marcia Harrison
got wind

19:55.820 --> 19:57.685
that Dave was gonna blow
the whistle on that whole

19:57.730 --> 20:00.426
cash for_ contract scheme she was
running With Robert Bright?

20:00.460 --> 20:02.951
Well, it's a motive.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.661
Plus, she was
at the fund-raiser,

20:04.700 --> 20:06.429
so she had access
to Dave's hotel room.

20:06.470 --> 20:08.335
Hold on-- _
we're talking about accusmg

20:08.370 --> 20:10.406
one of the top real estate
developers in this city

20:10.440 --> 20:11.805
of fraud and possibly murder?

20:11.840 --> 20:13.478
_ Not to mention
implicating the man

20:13.510 --> 20:15.330
who may be the next
mayor of New York.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.701
We need more than just
the word of a blogger.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.502
There's nothing
on Dave's work computers.

20:19.550 --> 20:21.575
But I say we find
whatever he was gonna hand over

20:21.620 --> 20:24.339
to Lisotta today at Penn
Station, we got our proof.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.745
Maybe it's still at Penn Station
in a locker.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.451
His keys were missing.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.984
No sign of his keys.
His wallet is right here.

20:32.030 --> 20:33.725
This wasn't about money.

20:38.970 --> 20:41.734
Is there a storage locker
near Penn Station

20:41.770 --> 20:43.658
that has the word "Pete" in it?

20:43.710 --> 20:46.634
I don't know-- Pete's Storage,
Pete's... something.

20:48.410 --> 20:49.729
Bingo!
Pete's Storage and Packing.

20:49.780 --> 20:51.668
It's on 36th Street
between 8th and 9th.

20:52.650 --> 20:53.878
Yes!

20:56.350 --> 20:58.011
No, we got cameras
that cover the cashier,

20:58.050 --> 21:00.280
but not back here--
it's not that kind of place.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.753
What kind of place is it?

21:01.790 --> 21:03.382
Look, honestly,

21:03.430 --> 21:04.988
in the property
retention business,

21:05.030 --> 21:06.452
you get what you pay for.

21:06.490 --> 21:07.593
Hey, you getting
evicted tomorrow,

21:07.630 --> 21:09.029
you need a place to
store your crap?

21:09.060 --> 21:10.721
You come to me.
But Fort Knox we're not.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.021
And if you could
afford Fort Knox,

21:12.070 --> 21:13.697
you wouldn't be
getting evicted, right?

21:13.740 --> 21:16.732
So, what kind of security
do you have in this place?

21:16.770 --> 21:18.965
MAN: Well, our clients get a
code to get in the hallway

21:19.010 --> 21:20.637
and a lock for the unit--
that's about it.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.375
I would say the system
is fairly secure.

21:22.410 --> 21:25.971
With an emphasis on "fairly."

21:28.080 --> 21:31.311
No luck on the
storage locker, I hear?

21:31.350 --> 21:34.683
Nope. But I'm reviewing exterior
security footage from the area,

21:34.720 --> 21:37.325
hoping someone familiar pops up.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.554
You get any results back
on the makeup

21:38.590 --> 21:39.579
Webster found on the body?

21:39.630 --> 21:40.949
Oh, yeah.
As a matter of fact,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.719
some fancy French stuff
called JYB.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.726
Cost 500 bucks an
ounce or something.

21:45.770 --> 21:46.828
Belgium.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.030
Huh?

21:48.070 --> 21:51.062
JYB, it's from Belgium.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.328
Okay.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.439
So, we know someone entered
the hallway at Pete's Storage

21:55.480 --> 21:57.869
using the key code at 5:12 pm.

21:57.910 --> 22:00.049
They cleared out
Dave's locker.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.672
There wasn't even anyone else
in the building on Sunday.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.914
And whatever was in that locker

22:02.950 --> 22:04.110
has got to implicate Bright.

22:04.150 --> 22:05.583
Al, do you have a second?

22:05.620 --> 22:07.850
Yeah.

22:07.890 --> 22:10.586
Listen, I know I said
I was gonna stay out of this,

22:10.630 --> 22:12.586
but this is all _
pretty thin, isn't it?

22:12.630 --> 22:13.892
No, I don't think so.

22:13.930 --> 22:15.750
We know Dave was gonna
turn over the documents,

22:15.800 --> 22:18.667
and we know the documents
were taken from Dave's locker.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.669
Actually, we don't, strictly
speaking, know any of that.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.736
For the sake of your career
and for the careers

22:23.770 --> 22:25.806
of everyone in this section,

22:25.840 --> 22:27.603
if you plan on accusing
David O'Bannon,

22:27.640 --> 22:29.733
Robert Bright and Marcia
Harrison of being involved

22:29.780 --> 22:32.476
in a scandal of this magnitude,

22:32.510 --> 22:34.774
you're gonna need a lot more
than an online blogger

22:34.820 --> 22:36.014
and an empty locker.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.517
A lot more.

22:37.550 --> 22:40.951
You guys got
to see this.

22:40.990 --> 22:42.753
...you can imagine my distress

22:42.790 --> 22:44.826
when Mr. O'Bannon, a member

22:44.860 --> 22:46.487
of the Borough President's
office,

22:46.530 --> 22:49.897
approached me offering
to procure building contracts

22:49.930 --> 22:53.491
for me if I would contribute
to Robert Bright's campaign.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.168
He told me that
the Borough President himself

22:56.200 --> 22:59.636
was not aware of this offer,
but that if I agreed,

22:59.670 --> 23:02.070
he would raise
the plan with him.

23:02.110 --> 23:04.999
I, of course, told Mr. O'Bannon
I would have no part of it

23:05.050 --> 23:07.041
and immediately contacted

23:07.080 --> 23:09.548
Bob Bright. Bob?

23:09.580 --> 23:11.047
BRIGHT: Dave O'Bannon
was a longtime friend

23:11.090 --> 23:12.682
and, as Ms. Harrison
mentioned,

23:12.720 --> 23:14.608
a trusted aide.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.719
But after my own
internal investigation,

23:16.760 --> 23:20.594
it appears that he was
attempting to sell the power

23:20.630 --> 23:23.121
and influence
of my office for money.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.628
I want to assure
the people of New York

23:25.670 --> 23:28.059
that _Dave O'Bannon was
domg so on his own,

23:28.100 --> 23:30.762
and for his own good.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.801
I welcome a full investigation
by the Manhattan DA

23:32.840 --> 23:35.707
into this matter,
but, for now, I'm...

23:35.740 --> 23:37.742
I'm heartbroken
by this betrayal.

23:51.490 --> 23:52.889
You're a jackass,
you know that?

23:52.930 --> 23:55.194
Eliot...
How could you sell
Dave out?

23:55.230 --> 23:57.027
You know he couldn't possibly
have done what you said.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.960
Okay, you think I want
to believe it?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.468
He was our friend, Eliot.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.230
I-I looked after him,
I took him with me for years.

24:04.270 --> 24:05.862
You took him? He...

24:05.910 --> 24:07.571
He brought you up,
he made you.

24:07.610 --> 24:09.202
Yeah, well...

24:09.240 --> 24:11.947
I've been carrying him
for the last 18 months.

24:11.980 --> 24:14.676
Something was going on.
You would've known if you'd

24:14.720 --> 24:16.915
checked in on him
from time to time.

24:16.950 --> 24:18.087
He was dirty.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.985
There's evidence.
Lots of evidence.

24:20.020 --> 24:21.214
Your guys
would've found it.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.251
What would you do
in my position?

24:23.290 --> 24:26.521
I would've made damn sure_I was
right before I went public.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.596
I am sure.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.894
Look, we always knew
Dave was street.

24:30.930 --> 24:32.898
We dressed him up,
he looked the part,

24:32.930 --> 24:34.659
but deep down, who knows?

24:34.700 --> 24:35.997
Sometimes people
just go back

24:36.040 --> 24:38.235
to being who they are.
Bob.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.465
We really are
running behind.
All right.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.948
I'm sorry, Eliot.

24:51.050 --> 24:52.711
What'd you get
from Marcia Harrison?

24:52.750 --> 24:54.183
She handed over
everything.

24:54.220 --> 24:56.586
Full access to her financials,
independent audit

24:56.620 --> 24:59.088
of all her dealings,
complete calendar.

24:59.130 --> 25:01.155
She was upstairs at the time
of O'Bannon's murder.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.622
She couldn't be cleaner.

25:02.660 --> 25:03.968
Bright, too.
Turned over his financials

25:04.000 --> 25:05.797
and his alibi is airtight.
Okay, we know

25:05.830 --> 25:08.094
Dave O'Bannon was involved
in some kind of corruption.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.096
Lisotta says he was
trying to come clean.

25:10.140 --> 25:11.607
And someone didn't want that.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.868
Same person who
knew about the locker.

25:12.910 --> 25:14.070
I want the names

25:14.110 --> 25:15.179
of everyone Dave O'Bannon

25:15.210 --> 25:16.871
had contact with
in the last few weeks

25:16.910 --> 25:18.207
leading up to his murder.
I'm guessing

25:18.250 --> 25:20.718
our killer's in that group.
Names, Jay.

25:20.750 --> 25:21.910
I'm on it, boss.

25:25.290 --> 25:27.246
You get very far
tracking O'Bannon?

25:27.290 --> 25:28.951
I'm combing through
closed circuit footage,

25:28.990 --> 25:31.049
trying to fill in the
last month of his life--

25:31.090 --> 25:32.887
restaurants, clubs.

25:32.930 --> 25:35.819
Traced a credit card receipt
last week to this place.

25:35.860 --> 25:38.021
Jeffrey's, over on 49th St.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.992
Yeah, I know it.
Looks like we got nothing

25:40.030 --> 25:41.258
on O'Bannon going inside,

25:41.300 --> 25:42.836
but maybe he entered
through the back.

25:42.870 --> 25:45.031
Now... that's the time
from the receipt.

25:45.070 --> 25:46.833
I'm waiting to see
if there's anybody

25:46.870 --> 25:48.576
who has ties to the slqscrapers

25:48.610 --> 25:50.976
_ or the trash contracts who
might have been g0ing in or out.

25:51.010 --> 25:52.602
Can you...
So far, I got nothing.

25:52.650 --> 25:53.969
Can you widen out

25:54.020 --> 25:55.112
right there,
at the curb?

25:55.150 --> 25:56.310
The car?
Yeah.

25:56.350 --> 25:57.817
Yeah.

25:57.850 --> 26:00.080
Holy smokes,
that's a classic.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.109
They stopped making 'em in '74.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.082
See? I told you, boss--
disco killed everything.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.156
You want to take a look
at the plate?

26:05.190 --> 26:06.987
I can enhance it.
No, no, thanks.

26:07.030 --> 26:08.327
I'm all right.

26:12.730 --> 26:14.231
Hey, Al, you got a minute?

26:14.270 --> 26:16.738
Look, I, uh... I don't know

26:16.770 --> 26:18.203
what to do about this thing.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.901
What's the matter?

26:19.940 --> 26:21.373
Look, I totally get why Eliot's

26:21.410 --> 26:23.332
really invested
in this particular case,

26:23.380 --> 26:25.701
but I just found out
he logged into my computer

26:25.750 --> 26:27.206
through a back-door program
and downloaded

26:27.250 --> 26:29.946
all the files related
to the O'Bannon case.

26:29.980 --> 26:33.950
I know he's our boss, but...
seems kind of weird, right?

26:33.990 --> 26:36.083
Yeah, it does.
And there's a couple
other things,

26:36.120 --> 26:38.850
you know, questions
he's been asking. I mean...

26:38.890 --> 26:40.858
Is there something going on
I should know about?

26:40.900 --> 26:43.664
I sure hope not.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.805
Eliot.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.171
What's going on?

26:56.210 --> 26:58.246
Jay just told me
about the files.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.407
Easy, Burns, it's nothing.
I just thought it would be best

27:00.450 --> 27:02.179
ifI kept a low profile on this.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.245
Low profile? Given your
personal involvement here,

27:04.290 --> 27:06.019
you should have no profile.

27:06.050 --> 27:07.142
This isn't about you.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.658
It is not about
the investigation.

27:09.690 --> 27:11.658
It is a personal matter.

27:11.690 --> 27:15.126
If it's about Dave O'Bannon,
it is about the investigation.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.958
Are you covering for him?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.695
Covering for...?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.036
Al, Dave was...

27:25.070 --> 27:27.106
having an affair with my wife.

27:27.140 --> 27:28.869
What?!
Yeah.

27:28.910 --> 27:31.743
That little patch
of makeup Webster found on him?

27:31.780 --> 27:33.975
That $500

27:34.020 --> 27:36.045
The reason I know
it's from Belgium

27:36.080 --> 27:37.377
is because I bought it
for Shelby

27:37.420 --> 27:39.411
the last time I was in Brussels.

27:40.490 --> 27:42.151
That doesn't prove anything.

27:42.190 --> 27:43.179
It's an
exclu5ive brand.

27:43.220 --> 27:45.723
It's not even
sold in the US.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.251
Then I see her car
parked outSIde

27:48.300 --> 27:50.188
of a restaurant that_I know
Dave's eating in.

27:50.230 --> 27:52.289
They're friends,
they're having lunch...
Well, he came in

27:52.330 --> 27:55.094
the back door.
He probably left the same way.

27:55.140 --> 27:57.062
It's funny, huh?

27:57.100 --> 27:59.933
The Aspen Conference
last March.

27:59.970 --> 28:03.303
Shelby was presenting for her
environmental do-gooder group.

28:03.340 --> 28:06.207
She stays
at the Twelve Tree--

28:06.250 --> 28:09.469
that sour little hotel
in the woods?

28:09.520 --> 28:12.239
Dave O'Bannon had a room
three doors down.

28:12.290 --> 28:14.019
And on and on

28:14.060 --> 28:16.278
and wearily on, it goes.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.824
Receipts of Dave's
that Jay's been tracking.

28:19.860 --> 28:22.226
They match times
Shelby told me she was...

28:22.260 --> 28:26.264
meeting friends or getting
her hair done or all the...

28:26.300 --> 28:28.336
usual excuses.

28:29.970 --> 28:31.267
Eliot.

28:32.540 --> 28:34.974
I'm sorry.

28:36.980 --> 28:38.299
Well, she'll have information

28:38.350 --> 28:40.102
on O'Bannon's state of mind.

28:40.150 --> 28:43.415
Maybe he bared his soul
along with everything else.

28:43.450 --> 28:46.089
I suppose you'll
need to talk to her.

28:48.190 --> 28:50.181
I think you need to talk to her.

28:58.900 --> 29:00.162
You wouldn't understand.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.260
What don't I understand?
Come on, Shelby.

29:03.300 --> 29:05.768
Lay it on me.
What possible reason

29:05.810 --> 29:08.301
could I have given you
for having an affair

29:08.340 --> 29:10.376
with one_of
my closest friends?

29:10.410 --> 29:11.775
I never slept with Dave.

29:11.810 --> 29:14.449
Aspen

29:14.480 --> 29:16.277
Yeah.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.140
I know about Aspen.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.249
I... Davejust...
He happened to be there.

29:20.290 --> 29:21.917
And I'm glad he was.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.450
Secret rendezvous at Jeffrey's?

29:23.490 --> 29:25.788
We had drinks.
How did your makeup

29:25.830 --> 29:27.229
get on his hand?

29:27.260 --> 29:29.148
We found it.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.464
I_t's a_little
foren5ic thing we do.

29:31.500 --> 29:34.492
This is why, you know.

29:38.270 --> 29:41.273
We don't know each other
anymore, Eliot.

29:41.310 --> 29:42.971
I mean, you don't know me.

29:43.010 --> 29:44.807
No, I don't.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.545
Fine, what-- you...

29:46.580 --> 29:48.275
want us to go back to Sharon?

29:48.320 --> 29:50.276
Because I'm pretty sure
she's gonna say

29:50.320 --> 29:52.208
cheating on your husband
is not the way to...

29:52.250 --> 29:54.309
I never slept with Dave!

29:54.360 --> 29:56.555
Ugh.

29:56.590 --> 29:59.286
That afternoon,
at the fund-raiser...

29:59.330 --> 30:00.581
I, uh...

30:00.630 --> 30:03.258
I went early to talk to him.

30:03.300 --> 30:06.463
I had made up my mind
to leave you.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.467
I cried, but I knew
I had to do it.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.271
Dave talked me out of it.

30:19.150 --> 30:22.813
He took my face in his hands...

30:24.220 --> 30:26.188
and told me what a loving,

30:26.220 --> 30:28.859
wonderful man you are.

30:28.890 --> 30:30.585
And that you deserved

30:30.620 --> 30:32.827
a second chance.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.968
So...

30:44.010 --> 30:46.899
there's your answer
to the little...

30:46.940 --> 30:48.931
forensic thing.

30:52.080 --> 30:54.071
What's my answer?

30:56.020 --> 30:58.011
That's what I want to know.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.958
She never spoke with Dave
about his business dealings or

31:11.000 --> 31:12.524
anything else, for that matter.

31:12.570 --> 31:14.993
I guess he was just
a shoulder to cry on.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.291
Eliot, I'm sorry.

31:16.340 --> 31:17.568
Yeah, me too.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.239
Hey, boss, uh,

31:20.270 --> 31:22.409
is this a bad time?
It's terrible. Come in.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.647
Okay. I got the analysis
back of the ash

31:24.680 --> 31:27.444
in the Sterno can,
from the crime scene.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.141
Turns out it was
a piece of paper.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.284
We also found some
adheswe and some ink.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.311
A sticker of some kind.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.425
Like from a name tag
you might wear

31:40.460 --> 31:43.020
at, say, a fundraiser?

31:43.060 --> 31:44.425
Could be. Sure.

31:44.470 --> 31:45.619
AMANDA:
Excuse me.

31:45.670 --> 31:47.365
Bob, Debby Ellenson just wants

31:47.400 --> 31:49.595
five minutes, and they're gonna
need you up on the dais.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.267
I'm sorry, Detectives.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.107
Mr. Bright
had to cancel

31:53.140 --> 31:54.698
a campaign event
for tonight.

31:54.740 --> 31:57.379
But he had some constituent
meetings at the office,

31:57.410 --> 31:58.502
so he'll be
available

31:58.550 --> 32:00.040
to talk with you ASAP.

32:05.220 --> 32:08.485
It was a name tag.
Bright's aide, Amanda Temple.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.284
She had one name tag on
before Dave was murdered

32:11.330 --> 32:13.355
and a completely
different one after.

32:13.390 --> 32:14.357
What do we know about her?

32:14.400 --> 32:16.550
Campaign advisor Bright
brought in from Chicago.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.022
Fixer type.

32:18.070 --> 32:19.423
Reputation
for hardball.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.199
AL: So to
protect Bright,

32:21.240 --> 32:22.389
she plays hardball,
she kills Dave,

32:22.440 --> 32:24.408
then she realizes
she lost her name tag,

32:24.440 --> 32:25.964
makes herself a new one.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.602
Jay, did the
analysis indicate

32:27.640 --> 32:30.234
what kind of ink was
used on that name tag?

32:30.280 --> 32:33.249
Yeah. It's, uh...
Ink's from a fountain pen.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.578
Something fancy
called a Montegrappa.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.417
I think I'm
saying it right.

32:48.430 --> 32:50.557
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?

32:50.600 --> 32:52.397
Oh, hi, Amanda.

32:52.430 --> 32:53.590
Is this your car?

32:53.630 --> 32:56.531
Yes. What is this, Detective?
Huh.

32:56.570 --> 32:58.663
Illinois plates. You've been in
the state for over six months,

32:58.710 --> 33:01.304
and you should've gotten
new plates by now.

33:01.340 --> 33:02.500
You have to be kidding me.

33:02.540 --> 33:05.577
What, they have you handing out
tickets now?

33:05.610 --> 33:08.010
It's, like, budget cuts,
you know?

33:09.050 --> 33:10.517
Here we go.

33:10.550 --> 33:12.711
Sign this,
please.

33:14.490 --> 33:16.458
Can I have the pen?
I'm sorry.

33:16.490 --> 33:18.629
Don't take it personally. It's
just that I loan people my pens

33:18.660 --> 33:20.184
to sign these.
I've lost, like, 100.

33:20.230 --> 33:21.458
I got to draw the line
somewhere, you know?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.149
Fine. Whatever.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.259
Whoa.

33:25.300 --> 33:27.598
Wow. Is

33:27.630 --> 33:29.063
Yeah.
You know,

33:29.100 --> 33:31.068
they make their own ink
for their pens.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.509
Very unique.

33:32.540 --> 33:33.507
Great.
Thanks for the education.

33:34.610 --> 33:35.508
We done here?

33:35.540 --> 33:37.098
No.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.142
We're just beginning.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.412
The ink from your pen
is a perfect match

33:46.450 --> 33:49.317
to the sample we
have in evidence.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.682
Doesn't conclusively place me
in the hotel room.

33:52.730 --> 33:54.391
Once we checked your prints
against the partials

33:54.430 --> 33:56.796
we picked up,
it got pretty conclusive.

33:56.830 --> 33:58.798
Plus, the cut to
Dave's throat

33:58.830 --> 34:01.139
was messy-- my guess is,
once we test your clothes

34:01.170 --> 34:03.365
for blood... There's
a big difference
I wasn't...

34:03.400 --> 34:05.664
between murder one and
manslaughter, Amanda.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.406
We know you killed him.
Help me out here,

34:08.440 --> 34:11.409
so I can help you.

34:15.380 --> 34:17.746
It was an accident.

34:17.780 --> 34:19.384
I didn't go there
to hurt him.

34:19.420 --> 34:22.753
Things, they just got out
of hand, I swear.

34:22.790 --> 34:24.155
What happened?

34:24.190 --> 34:25.828
O'Bannon and I
set everything up.

34:25.860 --> 34:27.680
We were going
to approach Marcia Harrison.

34:27.730 --> 34:30.528
And then he just changed
his mind.
So you go

34:30.560 --> 34:33.097
to his room at the hotel
to change it back.
Yes.

34:33.130 --> 34:35.530
But he was furious and...

34:35.570 --> 34:37.538
he'd been drinking and...

34:37.570 --> 34:40.368
said that I was what was wrong
with politics today.

34:40.410 --> 34:42.571
Told me he'd been talking
to some reporter.

34:42.610 --> 34:44.202
When I tried to calm him down,
he came at me.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.501
So you cut his throat

34:45.550 --> 34:48.348
in self
I was scared.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.870
He was threatening me. I...

34:49.920 --> 34:51.888
picked up the knife.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.785
I tried to keep him back,

34:53.820 --> 34:55.515
and the next thing I know,
he's on the ground.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.627
What did Bright know?

35:00.660 --> 35:02.821
Nothing.

35:02.860 --> 35:05.693
I told him
that I had spoken to Dave

35:05.730 --> 35:08.528
but that he was fine
when I left the room.

35:08.570 --> 35:12.336
Then what was in those files you
took from Dave's storage locker?

35:15.180 --> 35:17.375
What files?

35:18.880 --> 35:21.872
I don't know anything
about a locker.

35:28.590 --> 35:30.717
I don't get it.
She confessed to killing Dave,

35:30.760 --> 35:32.728
but when I pressed her
about the information he had,

35:32.760 --> 35:35.194
she pulled the plug. She's
calling her lawyer right now.

35:35.230 --> 35:37.619
She didn't implicate
anybody else?

35:37.660 --> 35:39.924
AL:
Not Marcia Harrison
or Bob Bright.

35:39.970 --> 35:41.858
She says it was just her
and Dave.

35:41.900 --> 35:43.868
She'll go down for this,
probably manslaughter

35:43.900 --> 35:47.301
and some corruption charge.
But it ends with her.

35:47.340 --> 35:49.205
Oh. Here's the star
of the show.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.800
REPORTER: Mr. Bright.
Mr. Bright. Are we to believe

35:51.850 --> 35:54.216
you knew nothing about what
was going on in your office?

35:54.250 --> 35:55.842
There was clearly a group
inside my staff

35:55.880 --> 35:59.213
that worked covertly to use
the influence of this office

35:59.250 --> 36:00.444
to their benefit. I'm sorry.

36:00.490 --> 36:02.219
That's all I know right now.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.786
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:07.830 --> 36:09.889
One second.

36:09.930 --> 36:12.490
Yes. Wonderful.
Just have it delivered

36:12.530 --> 36:13.667
to the house.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.235
I, uh, got
everyone

36:18.270 --> 36:19.965
waiting for a statement.

36:20.010 --> 36:21.671
That ringtone.

36:23.280 --> 36:26.943
I know where the files are.

36:26.980 --> 36:28.811
Okay, listen, when we went
to Bright's office,

36:28.850 --> 36:31.410
he got a call, right?
He said it was about a rug.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.816
It was Amanda.
She was calling him

36:33.850 --> 36:35.818
about the documents
being delivered.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.385
The times match up.
We were there at the same time

36:38.430 --> 36:40.284
somebody got
into Dave's storage locker.

36:40.330 --> 36:41.888
She had just gotten the stuff
from his locker.

36:41.930 --> 36:44.262
That's what was being delivered
to his house.

36:44.300 --> 36:45.995
The files.

36:46.030 --> 36:48.260
BRIGHT:
Eliot.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.837
Why are you doing this?

36:50.870 --> 36:53.759
Look, whatever it is
you think you're looking for,

36:53.810 --> 36:55.607
it won't stick.

36:56.640 --> 36:57.902
You just... You're burning

36:57.940 --> 37:00.773
a bridge here,
a bridge that can still lead

37:00.810 --> 37:02.516
to our dream.
Remember?

37:02.550 --> 37:05.018
Me in the mayor's office.
You, police commissioner.

37:05.050 --> 37:07.746
We can still live
that dream-- we will.

37:07.790 --> 37:10.008
Think of the good
we can do for this town.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.722
Yeah-- what about
what we can do for Amanda?

37:16.830 --> 37:17.854
That's why
she's protecting you, right?

37:17.900 --> 37:20.562
So once you become mayor,
you can repay the favor.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.398
It's enough, Bob.
It's enough.

37:23.440 --> 37:27.604
Dave had nothing to
do with it, did he?

37:27.640 --> 37:29.403
You know what's gonna happen,

37:29.440 --> 37:30.805
Eliot, don't you?

37:34.920 --> 37:37.275
Yeah, I know.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.288
I don't care.

37:39.320 --> 37:40.912
You don't care?

37:40.950 --> 37:43.714
October 18, 1998?

37:43.760 --> 37:45.523
Huh?

37:45.560 --> 37:47.528
OFFICER: Found this in
the hall closet.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.051
Open it up.

37:50.100 --> 37:51.055
Eliot...

37:51.100 --> 37:53.625
Don't destroy everything.

37:53.670 --> 37:54.637
Cuff him.

37:57.500 --> 38:00.401
Yeah. Say good-bye
to Major Crimes, your friends...

38:01.440 --> 38:04.034
Everything.

38:06.910 --> 38:11.040
CARRIE: Eliot,

38:11.080 --> 38:15.050
what happened in 1998?

38:15.090 --> 38:19.652
I used to blame it
on us being young.

38:19.690 --> 38:21.829
But now I'm thinking...

38:21.860 --> 38:24.397
that's just who we are.

38:24.430 --> 38:26.864
We were...

38:26.900 --> 38:30.461
interns-- me, Bright and Dave--

38:30.500 --> 38:32.104
for a senator.

38:32.140 --> 38:34.802
Doesn't matter who.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.035
He loved us.

38:37.080 --> 38:40.971
He gave us that atrocious
nickname, the Three Amigos.

38:41.010 --> 38:43.911
Aanay, one night, uh, I get
a call, 4:00 in the morning.

38:43.950 --> 38:46.748
He's in Hell's Kitchen
and something's gone wrong.

38:46.790 --> 38:48.951
We go down and...

38:48.990 --> 38:52.585
find him in a room there
With a, um...

38:52.630 --> 38:55.656
well, with a girl who had...

38:55.700 --> 38:57.895
been careless with her opiates.

38:57.930 --> 39:00.922
She fell asleep,
never woke up.

39:00.970 --> 39:05.066
He didn't know what to do.

39:05.110 --> 39:08.932
We did.

39:08.980 --> 39:11.039
We made sure
nobody knew he was there.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.877
And going forward,

39:12.910 --> 39:15.947
whenever we needed a favor...

39:15.980 --> 39:18.778
well, the senator was there
for us.

39:19.790 --> 39:22.156
That was a long time ago.

39:22.190 --> 39:26.729
Doesn't seem that way to me.

39:50.050 --> 39:52.439
You headed home, Eliot?

39:52.490 --> 39:55.084
Mm-mm. Not just yet.

39:55.120 --> 39:58.624
Figured I'd savor
my last few moments here.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.025
It's not gonna go that way.

40:00.060 --> 40:01.789
No one's gonna believe
anything Bright says.

40:01.830 --> 40:03.798
Not after this.

40:03.830 --> 40:05.195
I don't know.
I wish I had your faith.

40:05.230 --> 40:06.993
CARRIE:
You don't need faith.

40:07.030 --> 40:08.531
You got me.

40:08.570 --> 40:10.959
And my buddy Declan.
What's he doing here?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.969
October 18, 1998.
You don't remember?

40:14.010 --> 40:16.137
Maybe?

40:16.180 --> 40:19.149
Well, Declan here
definitely remembers.

40:19.180 --> 40:21.648
Tell him, Dec.
My family's

40:21.680 --> 40:23.648
had the hauling contract
for Yankee Stadium

40:23.680 --> 40:25.489
going on 40 years.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.909
They gave us all a bunch
of tickets to the first...

40:27.950 --> 40:29.212
Second.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.582
...second game
of the World Series.

40:32.630 --> 40:35.519
I invited Dave.
He brought you along as well.

40:35.560 --> 40:38.120
Yeah, but I-I never went.
Sure, you did.

40:38.160 --> 40:38.922
There were 15 of us.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.926
We stayed
till the very last out.

40:40.970 --> 40:42.790
We went back
to my place.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.762
Everybody remembers
how excited you were.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.004
What else?

40:46.040 --> 40:48.235
DECLAN: It was such
a special night...

40:48.270 --> 40:50.830
you kept
your ticket stub.

40:52.010 --> 40:54.672
What a thoughtful gift.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.143
You got a pretty good memory.

40:57.180 --> 40:58.579
It's what I'm known for.

40:58.620 --> 41:00.542
That's funny. Me, too.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.517
Thank you.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.983
It's what Dave
would have wanted.

41:17.840 --> 41:19.762
What you doing sitting out here?

41:19.810 --> 41:23.007
Just waiting for you.

41:34.820 --> 41:37.983
I feel so bad for Dave.

41:38.020 --> 41:41.285
Seeing how far Bright
was willing to go, it...

41:41.330 --> 41:44.993
must've made him
question everything.

41:45.030 --> 41:48.067
Only it was too late for him.

41:52.270 --> 41:54.932
What is that?

41:56.780 --> 41:59.169
Uh, that's, uh,
peach blueberry.

41:59.210 --> 42:02.145
From Sweet Creations
in Nashville?

42:02.180 --> 42:03.818
I had to, uh, pull
a few strings.

42:03.850 --> 42:06.239
Course you did.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.868
Don't go.
