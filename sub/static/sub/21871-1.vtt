00:46.105 --> 00:47.105
Hit me.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.220
Again.

01:00.142 --> 01:02.177
Another round?

01:06.062 --> 01:07.124
Hold on.

01:29.105 --> 01:30.214
Hello?

01:34.156 --> 01:35.156
Jerry.

01:37.250 --> 01:38.818
Hey baby.

01:40.135 --> 01:41.720
What do you want?

01:45.525 --> 01:46.571
Jerry?

01:49.877 --> 01:51.379
I need my money.

01:52.297 --> 01:53.710
You're drunk.

01:54.076 --> 01:57.567
And you're a month behind, I need my alimony.

01:57.810 --> 02:01.434
I don't owe you anything till next month, Jerry.

02:01.749 --> 02:02.749
Hayley!

02:06.494 --> 02:09.178
It's an emergency.

02:10.185 --> 02:11.999
Are you kidding me?

02:12.024 --> 02:15.393
I'm barely making things
work with both of these jobs.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.377
Can you just lend me the money?

02:17.402 --> 02:18.939
I'll get it back to you.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.242
You know I'm good for it.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.311
No Jerry, you're not good for it.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.100
- You not good for...
- Hayley!

02:26.125 --> 02:27.948
Don't you hang up on me.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.857
- I will come over there. I will come over there...
- I'm sorry, Jerry.

02:32.163 --> 02:34.013
Hayley!

02:37.258 --> 02:39.335
Was that Jerry?

02:40.258 --> 02:42.828
Just go back up to bed, OK?

02:44.432 --> 02:46.857
You wanna sleep in here tonight?

02:59.269 --> 03:01.200
Are you gonna call the police?

03:01.225 --> 03:02.259
No.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.552
It's just your dad, OK.

03:04.585 --> 03:05.585
No.

03:06.458 --> 03:08.794
But he won't stop calling.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.525
Yeah, I know.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.912
Just get some sleep, alright.

03:16.053 --> 03:17.020
OK.

03:17.045 --> 03:18.046
Come on.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.333
OK.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.945
Senorita Lisa,

03:31.979 --> 03:32.922
I cannot make this work,
the fabric is shredded...

03:32.947 --> 03:34.985
Speak English.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.856
Melanie, a word.

03:36.881 --> 03:38.665
What can I do for you, Lisa?

03:38.690 --> 03:40.654
Remind me when dress rehearsal starts.

03:40.688 --> 03:41.473
An hour.

03:41.498 --> 03:42.723
Oh, and you're not ready.

03:42.748 --> 03:44.367
And your sole purpose for being here

03:44.392 --> 03:46.121
is to make sure we'll be ready.

03:46.146 --> 03:47.227
Well, we'll be ready.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.463
I just passed several idle workers.

03:49.497 --> 03:52.936
Unfinished set pieces and
a seamstress so distraught

03:52.961 --> 03:56.937
because the only costume for
this performance is ruined.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.473
Not to mention Gretchen, clumsy Gretchen,

03:59.507 --> 04:02.020
who broke her leg last week because she didn't

04:02.045 --> 04:04.149
know the dance routine well enough.

04:04.188 --> 04:05.346
I don't...

04:05.371 --> 04:07.548
I thought that you had
some pride in this theater

04:07.581 --> 04:09.134
and what it stands for.

04:09.159 --> 04:10.863
I certainly do.

04:10.888 --> 04:12.887
And to think how hard that I have worked

04:12.912 --> 04:15.396
only to have it all fall apart.
- It won't.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.410
And then you have your
nose attached to that thing.

04:18.435 --> 04:21.795
- It's the budget...
- Unaware that the world is crumbling around you.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.875
Um, I have a delivery for the theater.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.924
- We'll be ready.
- Oh?

04:27.104 --> 04:27.901
How?

04:27.935 --> 04:29.713
The main costume is ruined and I happen to know

04:29.737 --> 04:30.677
you don't have a spare.

04:30.702 --> 04:31.939
Well actually, I...

04:31.972 --> 04:33.774
I know what you're trying to do, Melanie.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.312
I know how you feel about me,

04:35.337 --> 04:36.977
and you seem to think that that means

04:37.010 --> 04:39.747
you can take and take and take.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.597
- I don't mean to interrupt,
- I just need a...

04:41.622 --> 04:45.034
Don't try to sabotage me or this theater

04:45.059 --> 04:47.140
by not doing your job.

04:47.165 --> 04:50.393
- I'm not.
- Not doing your job.

04:50.418 --> 04:52.840
Good, I'm glad you admit it.

04:52.865 --> 04:55.796
It's time that you earn your keep, Melanie.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.999
Now I am going to be in my office,

04:58.024 --> 05:01.770
and I don't want to be disturbed for 15 minutes.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.405
Hi, I just need a quick signature here.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.874
Have my niece do it?

05:09.807 --> 05:11.306
Who's her niece?

05:11.331 --> 05:12.249
I am.

05:12.274 --> 05:13.890
Oh, great.

05:13.915 --> 05:16.445
I just need a signature right here, please.

05:20.217 --> 05:21.817
- There you go, you have a good day.
- You too.

05:21.842 --> 05:22.766
Is that the costume replacements?

05:22.790 --> 05:23.723
Yep.

05:23.748 --> 05:24.748
Yes.

05:29.393 --> 05:31.103
I don't understand.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.142
Sorry Kevin, it's what the board has decided.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.763
But Mark said that I'm the best...

05:34.788 --> 05:36.425
Honestly Kevin, there are at least three

05:36.450 --> 05:37.981
much stronger candidates up for this position.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.096
The board felt that...

05:39.121 --> 05:40.684
Are you sure that it was the board that felt,

05:40.708 --> 05:42.410
but not you Sarah?

05:44.177 --> 05:46.701
I don't know what you're implying.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.119
Are you sure this isn't about that night
you and I...

05:52.152 --> 05:56.019
I have no clue what you're talking about.

06:01.396 --> 06:02.730
Come on, Sarah.

06:02.949 --> 06:04.433
Grow up.

06:12.112 --> 06:13.293
What?

06:13.318 --> 06:15.653
Oh, everything OK?

06:16.812 --> 06:20.837
Sorry, another charming moment with my boss.

06:20.862 --> 06:22.339
Lousy day.

06:22.364 --> 06:23.369
Yeah, me too.

06:23.394 --> 06:25.158
You wanna go out for drinks?

06:25.470 --> 06:26.837
Yeah, I'm in.

06:30.726 --> 06:33.561
Hayley, I'm just finishing up now, so.

06:33.586 --> 06:35.414
Oh great, great.

06:36.007 --> 06:37.256
Do you want help?

06:37.281 --> 06:40.100
No, I'm good, I'm about ready to lock up.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.869
OK, see ya.

06:41.894 --> 06:43.016
Thank you!

06:50.866 --> 06:52.069
Hey Jamie.

06:52.094 --> 06:56.433
Mom, uh, remember how I told
you I had a really big report

06:56.458 --> 06:57.785
for my English class?

06:57.818 --> 07:01.466
Yeah, if you're not too busy working tonight,

07:01.491 --> 07:03.231
maybe you can help me.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.497
No no no no, no.

07:04.522 --> 07:06.439
No, this is your homework.

07:06.464 --> 07:07.730
I can't do that again, OK.

07:07.755 --> 07:09.749
It's meant for you to learn.

07:09.774 --> 07:11.164
Fine.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.286
You know what, I will proofread
it though in the morning.

07:13.311 --> 07:14.602
How 'bout that?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.389
When will you be here?

07:16.414 --> 07:19.348
Uh, well I don't have any rideshares tonight,

07:19.373 --> 07:21.324
so I mean it really shouldn't...

07:21.623 --> 07:23.292
Hang on, just a sec.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.847
Alright, one just came in.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.749
OK, I gotta take it, so.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.145
There's some leftovers in the fridge, alright.

07:31.170 --> 07:32.036
OK.

07:32.061 --> 07:33.465
I'm sorry.

07:33.721 --> 07:36.189
It's fine, we need the money.

07:37.359 --> 07:39.660
Hey, get started on your paper, alright?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.020
I will.

08:15.563 --> 08:18.699
She looks at me with this seductive face,

08:18.732 --> 08:20.267
like of course she is.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.202
It makes no sense otherwise.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.489
Everything she's doing is
on purpose, and I know it.

08:25.351 --> 08:26.937
Do you think she's doing it on purpose?

08:26.962 --> 08:29.366
So, um, are you Kevin?

08:29.680 --> 08:30.614
Yep, that's me.

08:30.639 --> 08:33.296
So, uh, 345 East Hooper Street,

08:33.321 --> 08:35.860
we still going there?
- Yep, that's the one.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.596
It'll all work out.

08:44.621 --> 08:46.995
I'm not so sure anymore.

08:47.595 --> 08:51.212
At least not as long as we're working together.
It's a nightmare.

08:59.185 --> 09:00.822
Do you know what, I'm really sorry,

09:00.847 --> 09:03.773
I gotta take this, it's important.

09:09.729 --> 09:10.764
Sorry.

09:11.992 --> 09:12.992
Jerry.

09:15.623 --> 09:19.285
Jerry, I know you're there,
you called me, please just talk.

09:21.176 --> 09:22.963
Where are you?

09:22.996 --> 09:24.898
I'm working.

09:24.932 --> 09:29.169
You shouldn't be on the
phone while you're driving.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.338
What do you want?

09:32.277 --> 09:33.823
I want you

09:35.342 --> 09:38.979
to say your sorry for
hanging up on me last night.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.379
Come on, Jerry.

09:40.404 --> 09:45.012
Say you're sorry for
hanging up on me last night!

09:49.823 --> 09:53.260
I'm sorry for hanging up on you last night.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.429
Good.

09:55.996 --> 10:01.935
Now, say it again and mean it this time.

10:06.938 --> 10:10.644
Can you excuse me, for just a second, thanks.

10:13.052 --> 10:15.483
Wow, what do you think that was about?

10:15.508 --> 10:16.597
No idea.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.331
I'm sorry, I'm sorry about that.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.432
No problem.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.366
It's OK, though.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.737
I know a way that we can get there fast.

10:38.416 --> 10:41.201
Is everything OK?
That sounded serious.

10:42.263 --> 10:45.779
Yeah, thank goodness for
restraining orders, right?

10:45.813 --> 10:47.023
Well if you have a restraining order,

10:47.047 --> 10:48.939
they probably shouldn't be calling you, huh?

10:48.964 --> 10:51.919
No, they shouldn't, should they?

10:54.062 --> 10:57.137
Hey, we're going out for drinks,
come with us.

10:57.162 --> 11:01.294
That's really sweet of you,
but I have a daughter.

11:01.328 --> 11:05.465
Look, Kevin and I have
both had colossal suck days.

11:07.949 --> 11:10.244
We're both just gonna go get a little drunk

11:10.269 --> 11:12.247
and exchange sob stories.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.307
You need to come with us.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.296
It'll be like group therapy.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.835
Besides, there's a big tip involved.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.055
OK.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.134
OK yeah, let me just check in with my kid.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.721
She made it crystal clear
that it was a one night thing.

11:37.746 --> 11:39.624
What'd she say, something about executives

11:39.649 --> 11:42.002
can't be seen cavorting with peons.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.771
Hayley, you sure you don't want a drink.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.598
Oh no, I'm driving.

11:45.623 --> 11:48.341
And I was like OK, fine.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.388
Whatever, I was good with it.

11:50.909 --> 11:53.799
But then, not a week later,

11:54.192 --> 11:56.498
I think they called it budget cuts,

11:57.035 --> 11:58.852
but I got a pay cut.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.255
And then I got transferred to the call center.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.357
Wait wait, management, but still, come on.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.725
The call center?

12:05.750 --> 12:10.418
Like for the past year I've
been working my butt off

12:10.443 --> 12:12.397
to get back to where I was,

12:12.936 --> 12:16.136
but every time I put in for
a transfer, it gets rejected.

12:16.161 --> 12:18.872
Every time I'm up for a promotion, passed over.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.542
And she came on to me.

12:22.972 --> 12:24.307
There are people in everyone's lives

12:24.332 --> 12:27.781
who'd make the world a better
place by simply dropping dead.

12:29.126 --> 12:31.451
So true.

12:31.484 --> 12:35.377
Sarah Olsen, you weren't worth it anyway.

12:37.079 --> 12:39.281
All right, so we've heard about Kevin's boss,

12:39.306 --> 12:41.629
we've heard about my aunt Lisa.

12:41.654 --> 12:42.840
Hayley?

12:44.297 --> 12:47.750
No, no, you don't wanna
hear about my sob story.

12:47.775 --> 12:49.536
Oh yes we do.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.056
So,

12:55.384 --> 13:00.222
I took my daughter and left
my now ex-husband, Jerry.

13:00.247 --> 13:03.817
And in the middle of our really messy divorce,

13:03.851 --> 13:07.230
he got in an accident which
left him in a wheelchair.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.923
So he's been declared disabled.

13:09.957 --> 13:14.564
He was unable to work, so his lawyers used that

13:14.589 --> 13:17.684
to get a large alimony out of me.

13:17.709 --> 13:22.854
So now I kill myself every month to get him money

13:22.879 --> 13:25.380
which he uses for his gambling addiction,

13:25.405 --> 13:27.748
which of course is never enough.

13:28.780 --> 13:33.584
So he's constantly showing up,
calling me, threatening me,

13:33.609 --> 13:37.070
begging me, and pretty much doing whatever he can

13:37.095 --> 13:39.821
to make my life a living hell.

13:40.823 --> 13:42.664
I'm sorry.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.088
Why not just call the cops?

13:44.113 --> 13:46.393
Oh, I did call the police.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.296
I used to call them all the time.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.423
But you guys don't know Jerry.

13:51.866 --> 13:53.954
He has everyone fooled.

13:54.301 --> 13:57.789
And the cops, they don't
wanna be seen being tough

13:57.814 --> 13:59.834
on a guy in a wheelchair.

13:59.859 --> 14:02.519
No matter how much of a monster he is.

14:04.589 --> 14:06.878
Sometimes when everything is piling up

14:06.903 --> 14:10.150
on me and I feel like I'll be trapped
that way forever,

14:10.175 --> 14:14.321
there is this idea that keeps coming back, and.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.672
Ah, not this again.

14:15.697 --> 14:17.182
Alright, alright, alright.

14:17.776 --> 14:19.804
What if you get a group of people

14:19.829 --> 14:22.211
who are absolutely sick of their lives

14:22.236 --> 14:25.137
and you have them enter into a pack to improve

14:25.162 --> 14:27.888
each other's lives, no matter what it would take.

14:27.913 --> 14:31.438
But what if they can't
improve each other's lives?

14:31.471 --> 14:33.373
What if your life cannot be improved

14:33.406 --> 14:34.687
by the actions of another person?

14:34.712 --> 14:38.659
Well sometimes, all it takes
is someone else's perspective

14:38.684 --> 14:40.547
to improve things.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.066
Someone like you?

14:43.258 --> 14:45.584
Well that sounds wonderful,
but it would be illegal

14:45.609 --> 14:48.314
to do what it takes to fix my life.

14:48.339 --> 14:50.033
I think it would be illegal to do what it takes

14:50.057 --> 14:52.026
to fix any of our lives.

14:52.051 --> 14:56.546
Illegal, maybe, unjustified, no.

14:56.571 --> 14:58.914
OK, wait a minute.

14:59.406 --> 15:02.267
Are you suggesting what I
think you're suggesting?

15:02.702 --> 15:04.335
It's so simple.

15:05.203 --> 15:06.743
Can't you see it?

15:07.540 --> 15:09.109
Right, I help Kevin.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.202
Kevin helps Hayley.

15:11.227 --> 15:12.920
Hayley helps me.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.120
By doing what?

15:16.904 --> 15:18.628
Whatever it takes.

15:19.331 --> 15:20.826
Face it, these people are never gonna stop

15:20.851 --> 15:22.655
making our lives miserable.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.280
You think they're gonna wake up one day

15:24.305 --> 15:26.174
and see the light?

15:26.618 --> 15:27.638
No.

15:27.879 --> 15:29.551
People don't change.

15:30.010 --> 15:32.502
So, I will take Kevin's boss.

15:32.527 --> 15:34.754
Kevin, you take Hayley's ex.

15:34.779 --> 15:37.707
Hayley, you take my Aunt Lisa.

15:37.991 --> 15:41.520
Bam, our lives are infinitely better, hm?

15:44.060 --> 15:45.060
What?

15:45.286 --> 15:47.555
You keep saying take,
what exactly are you saying?

15:47.580 --> 15:48.959
I want you guys to think about it.

15:48.984 --> 15:51.136
I'm just, I'm gonna get another drink.

15:55.861 --> 15:57.124
It's on me.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.295
Thank you.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.944
You're welcome.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.993
What's your name?

16:03.750 --> 16:05.238
Sorry about your ex.

16:06.492 --> 16:08.400
Sounds like a real...

16:10.203 --> 16:12.155
You deserve better than that.

16:13.527 --> 16:15.241
We just met.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.225
How do you know what I deserve?

16:20.311 --> 16:23.919
OK, fine, let me rephrase it.

16:25.403 --> 16:29.559
I would like for you to be with someone
who's better than Jerry.

16:35.128 --> 16:38.133
I'm sorry about your situation, too.

16:38.477 --> 16:42.626
Have you thought about just switching jobs?

16:43.281 --> 16:44.347
Yeah,

16:44.671 --> 16:47.515
but then again,
why should I be the one to move?

16:47.540 --> 16:48.652
True.

16:50.147 --> 16:52.277
I dunno, maybe I'm just being petty about it.

16:52.302 --> 16:53.367
No.

16:55.745 --> 16:59.682
I dunno, maybe I should just let the past go.

17:01.323 --> 17:03.116
Look to brighter things.

17:06.172 --> 17:08.261
Did you guys want anything from the bar?

17:08.295 --> 17:11.153
No, no, I'm good, thank you.

17:12.417 --> 17:15.040
Did you think about what I said?

17:15.301 --> 17:16.445
About what?

17:16.471 --> 17:19.066
Working together to solve our problems.

17:19.090 --> 17:21.066
No, she's kidding.

17:21.090 --> 17:22.308
Am I?

17:23.791 --> 17:25.964
OK, this is exactly what I'm talking about.

17:25.990 --> 17:29.782
This is what I call a classic Melanie moment,
all talk.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.448
Doesn't have to be.

17:32.526 --> 17:35.304
OK, here's a deal for you.

17:35.757 --> 17:39.292
If you have the guts to
first, which I know you don't,

17:39.326 --> 17:41.411
then you can count me in.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.309
Don't say it if you don't mean it.

17:45.936 --> 17:47.018
Hayley?

17:47.581 --> 17:48.999
What do you think?

17:49.024 --> 17:51.317
Imagine waking up and not having that dread

17:51.342 --> 17:53.765
follow you around every moment.

17:56.676 --> 18:01.026
It would be, it'd be really nice, but come on.

18:01.621 --> 18:03.514
Let's be serious.

18:04.079 --> 18:05.232
I am.

18:06.194 --> 18:10.241
Sure, I'm completely serious
about needing another drink.

18:12.889 --> 18:16.370
You know what, I, I really,
I need to get back.

18:16.395 --> 18:18.628
Are you two ready?

18:19.288 --> 18:23.203
- Actually, I'm going to stay a bit longer.
- Really?

18:23.236 --> 18:26.181
And here is my part of the fare home.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.093
Oh no no no, that's, that's too much.

18:28.118 --> 18:29.609
Here you go.

18:31.201 --> 18:32.602
You two have fun.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.958
Oh, OK.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.183
See you later.

18:36.208 --> 18:40.973
Alright look, Melanie, she gets these ideas.

18:41.559 --> 18:43.754
And she just gets really excited about 'em,

18:43.779 --> 18:46.443
and really doesn't think 'em all the way through.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.818
And her situation...

18:49.666 --> 18:51.531
It's a lot worse than mine.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.767
But she'll drop it by morning.
That's how it always works.

18:59.798 --> 19:04.122
So, you and Melanie, are you?

19:04.147 --> 19:05.890
No, no.

19:06.353 --> 19:09.101
No no no, not us.

19:09.794 --> 19:12.919
No, we're just friends, that's it.

19:13.255 --> 19:14.786
Where'd you guys meet?

19:15.614 --> 19:17.536
The bar, actually.

19:19.759 --> 19:24.647
Yeah, I think we had both
had a pretty terrible day.

19:25.436 --> 19:26.909
Come in to drink down our sorrows,

19:26.933 --> 19:30.431
and then we met, talked, clicked, you know.

19:31.161 --> 19:33.371
But not romantically.

19:33.396 --> 19:34.408
No.

19:35.330 --> 19:36.830
Nnot with Melanie.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.926
Well not with anyone for that matter.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.926
How 'bout you?

19:49.789 --> 19:51.810
I don't know.
I'm just starting to wonder if I could ever

19:51.835 --> 19:55.295
really do the whole relationship thing again.

19:57.147 --> 19:59.248
After Jerry.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.909
You still love him?

20:06.306 --> 20:07.859
No, I don't.

20:07.884 --> 20:09.167
I don't.

20:12.407 --> 20:14.679
I really, I need to get home.

20:14.704 --> 20:16.539
Got it, totally cool.

20:18.140 --> 20:23.189
OK, would you maybe wanna pick this up again,

20:23.810 --> 20:26.249
say, maybe tomorrow?

20:26.559 --> 20:27.817
Tomorrow?

20:28.607 --> 20:30.797
Well, I actually have work.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.599
My other job tomorrow.

20:32.632 --> 20:33.800
Right, yeah.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.345
And then I had promised my daughter
that I'd help her with her homework.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.401
Cool, totally.

20:37.426 --> 20:39.506
But, uh, Sunday, maybe?

20:39.539 --> 20:40.740
Really?

20:40.773 --> 20:41.941
Yeah Sunday.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.477
Yeah, Sunday, perfect.

20:44.511 --> 20:45.635
Sunday.

20:46.088 --> 20:47.268
Alright.

20:47.783 --> 20:48.881
Great, Kevin.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.626
Yes, Kevin.

20:51.225 --> 20:54.253
OK, Sunday it is.
I will see you then.

20:55.488 --> 20:56.488
Alright.

21:09.736 --> 21:13.072
Leonidas, how come I don't know who that is.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.474
It's history.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.407
It's some Greek king that fought in a battle

21:16.432 --> 21:18.682
against the Martians.

21:19.138 --> 21:20.776
Spartians.

21:21.487 --> 21:24.050
It was the Spartans, yeah, I got it.

21:24.083 --> 21:24.984
Spartans.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.354
- Wanna read what I have so far?
- Sure.

21:28.451 --> 21:30.432
OK, Leonidas.

21:30.457 --> 21:33.721
So... tomorrow.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.661
You have a date?

21:37.028 --> 21:38.598
He's just a friend.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.932
That you just met.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.239
Right, and I'm just getting to know him.

21:42.264 --> 21:44.151
Isn't that a date?

21:44.667 --> 21:47.039
OK, yes, I guess it's a date.

21:47.073 --> 21:51.419
Good, I mean, he's not a jerk, right?

21:51.444 --> 21:52.783
I hope not.

21:52.808 --> 21:55.087
I guess we'll find out, huh?

21:55.112 --> 21:57.517
Can't be any worse than Jerry.

21:57.550 --> 22:00.093
Yeah, probably not.

22:01.241 --> 22:04.424
Hey, you know just because I call him Jerry

22:04.457 --> 22:07.000
that doesn't meant that you have to.

22:07.025 --> 22:08.493
He is still your dad.

22:08.518 --> 22:09.685
Not anymore.

22:14.534 --> 22:17.057
You have fun on your date, OK?

22:18.432 --> 22:22.074
Thanks, and you have fun with your Spartians.

22:41.772 --> 22:42.862
Hello.

22:42.895 --> 22:46.739
- Hey, it's Kevin.
- Hey, I'm just about ready actually, so I can...

22:46.764 --> 22:49.435
Yeah, umm, about that...

22:50.735 --> 22:53.131
- Hallo.
- Look, something's come up.

22:53.416 --> 22:57.580
I'm not like this, but it's, it's important.

22:58.229 --> 22:59.229
OK.

23:00.112 --> 23:03.116
Yeah, I understand.

23:03.650 --> 23:04.741
Thanks

23:06.053 --> 23:07.053
I'm sorry.

23:11.486 --> 23:15.823
Here you go, alright yeah, no problem.

23:16.492 --> 23:19.836
- Hayley Udall?
- Yeah, she's at the front.

23:20.872 --> 23:22.389
Hayley Udall.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.872
I'm Detective Marcs, Metro PD.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.007
I have a few questions for you.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.477
Is this about Jerry?

23:30.863 --> 23:33.845
No ma'am, do you know a Kevin Moore?

23:34.299 --> 23:35.658
Kevin, yeah.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.085
When was the last time you saw Kevin?

23:39.118 --> 23:42.508
Uh, Friday, Friday night.

23:43.344 --> 23:45.825
At what time did you see him?

23:45.858 --> 23:50.029
I'd say it was eight to a little past midnight.

23:50.062 --> 23:53.488
Yeah, that's when I dropped him off at his place.

23:53.513 --> 23:55.034
Where had you been?

23:55.067 --> 23:56.569
We went to a bar.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.181
I don't remember the name of it.

23:58.206 --> 24:00.879
It was on Hooper Street.

24:00.904 --> 24:02.627
So other people saw you there?

24:04.498 --> 24:06.981
I'm sorry,
can I ask you what this is all about?

24:07.006 --> 24:09.590
I can't really give you that information
at this point,

24:09.615 --> 24:11.490
but thanks for your time.

24:23.392 --> 24:26.533
You've reached Kevin, please leave a message.

24:26.566 --> 24:29.494
Hey Kevin, this is Hayley.

24:31.196 --> 24:32.603
Listen...

24:33.665 --> 24:36.208
 the police came by
and they wereasking some questions.

24:36.242 --> 24:39.372
I just wanted to make sure that you were OK.

24:40.032 --> 24:41.224
Call me.

25:14.058 --> 25:15.222
Olsen.

25:15.247 --> 25:18.581
Sarah Olsen, you weren't worth it anyway.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.486
Hi, this is Melanie.

25:29.511 --> 25:32.194
Leave a message and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

25:33.627 --> 25:38.337
Hi Melanie, this is Hayley from Friday night.

25:38.362 --> 25:41.240
Can you give me a call when you get this please?

25:41.273 --> 25:42.377
Thank you.

25:52.023 --> 25:53.124
Send.

25:58.989 --> 26:00.057
What?

26:00.410 --> 26:04.793
We make a pact to improve
things for each of us.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.926
No matter what it would take.

26:07.363 --> 26:10.603
Alright, I help Kevin, Kevin helps Hayley,

26:10.637 --> 26:12.402
and Hayley helps me.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.617
Hey, I can't talk right now Hayley.

26:24.651 --> 26:27.219
Kevin, hey, what's going on?

26:27.253 --> 26:28.722
I'm sorry.

26:29.121 --> 26:32.215
Sarah's dead, now I don't have a choice.

26:33.214 --> 26:34.950
I'm so sorry.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.136
What?

26:36.992 --> 26:38.113
Kevin?

26:46.223 --> 26:47.762
Jerry come on.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.040
Pick up.

26:49.737 --> 26:51.434
Please pick up.

26:51.663 --> 26:52.989
What?

26:54.426 --> 26:56.382
OK, you're OK.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.315
What do you want?

27:00.360 --> 27:05.571
I think that you might be in danger... maybe.

27:05.596 --> 27:07.660
Is that some kind of a threat?

27:07.694 --> 27:10.444
No, but I really, I need
you to listen to me please.

27:10.469 --> 27:13.334
I still owe you a visit for hanging up on me.

27:13.359 --> 27:15.868
Jerry, hey hey, where are you?

27:15.902 --> 27:19.707
I'm at physical therapy, stupid.

27:28.195 --> 27:29.371
No.

27:32.885 --> 27:33.885
Oh no.

27:39.155 --> 27:41.681
Oh, what the hell, man.

27:43.759 --> 27:45.900
Watch where you're going.

27:56.469 --> 27:58.264
Hey Jamie,
I'm gonna run a quick errand OK.

27:58.289 --> 27:59.594
I'll be right back.

27:59.619 --> 28:00.688
OK.

28:20.806 --> 28:22.759
Hey, this is Jeremy Udall.

28:23.061 --> 28:25.767
After the tone, you know what to do.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.101
Hey Jerry, it's me, can you call me please?

28:29.126 --> 28:30.665
Thank you.

28:47.147 --> 28:49.811
You've reached Kevin.
Please leave a message.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.222
Come keys ,come.

29:11.721 --> 29:12.760
What?

29:12.785 --> 29:15.797
Hey, Melanie, hi, this is Hayley.

29:15.822 --> 29:17.745
Why are you calling me, Hayley?

29:18.167 --> 29:21.000
I saw that Kevin's boss was murdered.

29:21.391 --> 29:23.424
I can't get a hold of him.

29:23.449 --> 29:26.602
Kevin is doing what he's supposed to be doing.

30:21.131 --> 30:24.928
- Can I help you?
- Hi, is Jerry Udall here?

30:24.953 --> 30:26.811
He told me that he would be here.

30:26.836 --> 30:29.835
I'm sorry, there's nobody here.
Everything's locked up for the night.

30:29.860 --> 30:30.803
Are you sure?

30:30.828 --> 30:32.291
Yes ma'am, I've been here for a few hours

30:32.316 --> 30:33.963
and haven't seen anybody.

30:34.190 --> 30:35.158
OK.

30:35.183 --> 30:37.283
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.

31:28.343 --> 31:30.069
Hey, it's Jerry Udall.

31:30.572 --> 31:32.889
After the tone, you know what to do.

31:38.513 --> 31:39.552
Mom?

31:40.521 --> 31:41.886
Are you sick?

31:41.911 --> 31:44.113
I can't get ahold of Jerry.

31:44.138 --> 31:47.083
He's not picking up, he
wasn't at his PT appointment,

31:47.108 --> 31:49.005
his apartment, I just...

31:49.030 --> 31:51.482
He's probably drunk and passed out somewhere.

31:51.507 --> 31:53.007
I'm worried about him,
I mean, what if he...

31:53.032 --> 31:56.342
Why?
Why are you even worried?

31:57.171 --> 31:59.662
- I don't know.
- We're better off without him.

31:59.687 --> 32:02.568
OK, you know what, can just not
say things like that right now.

32:02.593 --> 32:04.474
Mom, you're acting all weird.

32:04.499 --> 32:06.867
- I'm sorry.
- I've gotta go to school.

32:07.228 --> 32:08.296
Great.

32:09.308 --> 32:11.051
OK, it's OK.

32:11.418 --> 32:13.136
Mom!

32:13.161 --> 32:15.426
Someone's at the door.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.129
Come in.

32:18.917 --> 32:22.445
- It's for you.
- Oh, Jamie.

32:22.470 --> 32:25.503
You better head out to school, alright.

32:26.707 --> 32:28.356
- Go ahead.
- Bye.

32:28.936 --> 32:30.106
Come on in.

32:31.887 --> 32:32.893
Please.

32:32.918 --> 32:35.698
This is my partner, Detective Whitman.

32:35.723 --> 32:37.467
Great, yeah, sit down.

32:37.740 --> 32:40.170
What is all of this about?

32:40.358 --> 32:44.178
It's about your ex-husband, Jerry Udall.

32:46.794 --> 32:50.185
He was found dead last night
in a parking lot downtown.

32:57.146 --> 32:58.350
Jerry is...

33:00.209 --> 33:01.334
Dead.

33:01.717 --> 33:02.808
Yes ma'am.

33:02.833 --> 33:06.371
Can you possibly think of anyone
that would want Jerry dead?

33:10.284 --> 33:14.470
-No I... I don't know.

33:14.495 --> 33:17.367
You two had a pretty rocky relationship,
is that right?

33:17.392 --> 33:20.689
Domestic disturbances, ER
visits, that sort of thing.

33:23.730 --> 33:25.978
When was the last time you saw Jerry?

33:31.111 --> 33:33.328
Two... two weeks ago.

33:33.625 --> 33:35.390
He came into my work.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.453
Wait, but didn't you have
a restraining order against him.

33:39.889 --> 33:42.076
So why didn't you call the police.

33:43.366 --> 33:45.592
Just it's never helped before.

33:46.334 --> 33:49.725
So where were you last
night between eight and 10 PM.

33:50.069 --> 33:55.044
I was here most of the time
with my daughter.

33:55.069 --> 33:58.192
I did go out for a little bit to a PT clinic,

33:58.217 --> 33:59.589
but it was just for a bit.

33:59.756 --> 34:02.308
Around what time were you at the clinic.

34:03.219 --> 34:05.958
Ninish, nine.

34:07.921 --> 34:11.458
Physical therapy at 9:00,
that seems a little late.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.005
What were you doing there?

34:13.311 --> 34:15.835
I was looking for my ex-husband.

34:16.592 --> 34:19.322
Was there anyone at the
clinic that saw you last night?

34:19.746 --> 34:21.971
Yeah, there was a security guard.

34:25.170 --> 34:31.027
We happened to get
some security camera footage

34:31.052 --> 34:33.629
from the club last night.

34:36.605 --> 34:39.504
Do you possibly recognize this figure here.

34:39.529 --> 34:42.492
We think that's more than likely Jerry's killer.

34:47.764 --> 34:50.764
He's... he's standing?

34:51.011 --> 34:52.272
Who, what?

34:52.297 --> 34:54.045
Well Jerry was...

34:54.862 --> 34:57.390
he was disabled.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.982
If there's more that you could tell us.

35:04.731 --> 35:05.990
Ms. Udall?

35:11.506 --> 35:14.012
Well, thank you for your time, Ms. Udall.

35:14.037 --> 35:15.695
I just, I have one more question.

35:15.720 --> 35:19.662
What exactly were you doing
meeting Jerry last night?

35:23.720 --> 35:26.725
I was bringing him money.

35:27.702 --> 35:30.663
And he told you he was gonna be at the clinic?

35:33.021 --> 35:35.462
Alright, that'll be all for now.

35:35.487 --> 35:36.688
Thank you.

37:13.791 --> 37:15.292
This isn't real.

37:16.659 --> 37:18.252
This isn't happening.

37:20.703 --> 37:21.924
I had to.

37:26.001 --> 37:28.003
I didn't want to.

37:29.031 --> 37:31.446
Have you talked to Melanie about it?

37:34.118 --> 37:37.719
She told me I was going to prison

37:38.305 --> 37:40.678
if I didn't hold up my end of the pact.

37:42.641 --> 37:44.789
I found out Sarah was dead,

37:45.539 --> 37:48.482
and first I thought it was just a coincidence.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.109
It had to be.

37:51.804 --> 37:52.988
Right?

37:54.209 --> 37:55.456
But then...

37:56.261 --> 37:57.464
I dunno.

38:00.483 --> 38:02.717
When I found out, I...

38:03.280 --> 38:04.897
I was excited...

38:05.710 --> 38:06.951
one moment, then...

38:07.694 --> 38:09.623
freaked out the next.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.528
The police questioned me yesterday.

38:15.836 --> 38:17.922
Yeah, they talked to me, too.

38:18.624 --> 38:19.891
About you.

38:25.539 --> 38:27.547
You wanna know the funny thing.

38:29.141 --> 38:32.844
I found out I'm being reconsidered
for the promotion at work.

38:33.456 --> 38:37.505
Apparently Sarah was the only one opposed to it.

38:38.447 --> 38:39.638
But now, I...

38:45.794 --> 38:50.210
Melanie kept saying...
that you were relying on me.

38:52.223 --> 38:54.317
So I kept telling myself that.

38:55.673 --> 38:57.622
And to keep me safe too.

38:57.925 --> 38:59.528
I had to do it.

39:01.522 --> 39:04.634
I'm so... sorry, Hayley.

39:06.943 --> 39:10.878
These were awful... evil people.

39:12.692 --> 39:13.807
Sarah.

39:15.106 --> 39:16.245
Jerry.

39:17.036 --> 39:18.557
Melanie's aunt.

39:19.096 --> 39:20.281
But I just...

39:21.267 --> 39:23.773
I didn't know it was gonna be this hard.

39:27.055 --> 39:29.204
I didn't know it'd be like this.

39:32.937 --> 39:35.383
I thought I was doing everyone a favor.

39:39.751 --> 39:41.352
What am I gonna do?

39:43.242 --> 39:45.511
Hayley, what am I gonna do?

39:46.318 --> 39:49.883
Kevin, there's only one thing that we can do.

39:53.832 --> 39:56.313
We need to go to the police.

39:59.691 --> 40:00.770
What?

40:01.645 --> 40:05.926
We go to the police and
we tell them what happened.

40:11.378 --> 40:12.497
No.

40:12.522 --> 40:16.148
Kevin, if we go to the police alright,
they can help us.

40:16.173 --> 40:18.209
No no no, I can't.

40:18.234 --> 40:20.490
No, you don't understand, you don't understand.

40:20.515 --> 40:22.381
OK Melanie, she's different.

40:22.406 --> 40:24.648
I've never seen her like this before.

40:25.718 --> 40:29.689
OK, all the time, I thought
it was just idle talk.

40:32.573 --> 40:34.648
You don't understand.

40:35.940 --> 40:39.212
Kevin, if we go to the
police then they can help us.

40:39.237 --> 40:41.040
No, of course you would say that,

40:41.065 --> 40:43.268
because you haven't done anything.

40:45.191 --> 40:46.900
I killed a man!

40:47.885 --> 40:49.611
I... I... I know.

40:50.588 --> 40:55.879
But Kevin, you can't,
you can't live like this, can you?

40:56.280 --> 40:58.793
So here's what we're gonna do.

40:59.778 --> 41:02.768
You and I,
we're gonna go down to the police.

41:02.793 --> 41:05.104
I will go with you,
we will go down together,

41:05.129 --> 41:07.526
and we will tell them about Melanie,

41:07.551 --> 41:11.466
and tell them about Sarah, about Jerry,
about all of it, alright?

41:11.491 --> 41:12.842
- Look, I just...
- Please.

41:12.867 --> 41:13.913
I need time to think.

41:13.938 --> 41:16.007
I need time to think about this.

41:16.939 --> 41:17.939
OK?

41:18.089 --> 41:19.210
Alone.

41:19.695 --> 41:20.803
Please.

41:23.876 --> 41:25.430
OK, alright.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.445
Alright.

41:34.342 --> 41:35.467
OK.

41:38.402 --> 41:39.722
Hayley.

41:43.495 --> 41:45.480
You wouldn't turn me in, would you?

41:49.294 --> 41:50.329
No.

41:52.452 --> 41:54.100
Do you promise?

41:56.718 --> 41:58.007
Thank you.

42:20.397 --> 42:23.130
Mom, Riana said she would help me with math,

42:23.155 --> 42:25.098
so I'm going over to her house.

42:25.123 --> 42:27.295
Jamie, we need to talk.

42:27.320 --> 42:29.014
Can we do it later?

42:30.511 --> 42:33.534
It's Jerry, it's your dad.

42:34.191 --> 42:35.859
Mom, what's wrong?

42:36.885 --> 42:38.440
Here, come here, honey.

42:38.801 --> 42:40.010
Mom.

42:43.787 --> 42:44.967
-He...

42:48.771 --> 42:50.131
He's dead.

42:59.957 --> 43:01.066
What?

43:01.539 --> 43:03.792
He was... he was killed.

43:12.995 --> 43:14.120
Good.

43:30.508 --> 43:32.376
I'm glad he's dead.

43:36.590 --> 43:37.837
I know.

43:41.121 --> 43:42.356
I know.

43:49.329 --> 43:50.712
It's weird.

43:51.718 --> 43:53.554
I don't feel anything.

43:54.281 --> 43:55.884
No it's not weird.

43:58.127 --> 44:00.689
I used to hate him so bad,

44:01.567 --> 44:04.689
but... now that he's gone

44:04.931 --> 44:08.111
I don't know. I can't figure it out.

44:11.206 --> 44:12.661
Me neither.

44:13.986 --> 44:15.489
How did he...

44:17.001 --> 44:18.748
how did he die?

44:19.302 --> 44:22.053
The police are investigating, OK?

44:24.323 --> 44:25.568
Who is that?

44:27.250 --> 44:28.742
It's a friend.

44:29.812 --> 44:33.522
He needs some help,
so I'm gonna go and meet him, alright.

44:33.547 --> 44:35.178
Can I go with you?

44:35.203 --> 44:39.258
No, you should really be in school, alright?

44:40.848 --> 44:42.650
I don't wanna go.

44:43.512 --> 44:47.277
I mean... because of dad.

44:48.762 --> 44:52.176
OK, alright, well why don't you just go ahead
and stay here then.

44:52.847 --> 44:54.682
I wanna go with you.

44:55.175 --> 44:57.378
- I just, I'm not sure that...
- Mom.

44:57.879 --> 44:59.089
Please.

44:59.784 --> 45:01.745
I don't wanna be alone.

45:13.160 --> 45:14.489
Are you OK?

45:19.129 --> 45:22.111
OK, I'm gonna go and get my friend.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.521
What's wrong?

45:25.883 --> 45:28.420
He's just in a little bit of trouble but...

45:29.464 --> 45:31.357
he's gonna be OK.

45:56.741 --> 45:57.788
OK.

46:04.242 --> 46:05.611
Kevin.

46:19.171 --> 46:20.258
OK.

46:29.906 --> 46:31.094
Kevin?

46:34.178 --> 46:35.329
Kevin?

46:39.837 --> 46:41.007
Kevin?

47:00.385 --> 47:01.419
OK.

47:07.454 --> 47:10.532
Hi, are you Hayley's daughter?

47:11.202 --> 47:13.743
I'm your mom's friend, yeah.

47:14.149 --> 47:16.149
What are you guys doing here?

47:22.657 --> 47:24.675
Mind if I stick around,
wait for your mom to get back?

47:24.700 --> 47:26.310
Melanie?

47:27.367 --> 47:28.484
Hayley.

47:30.278 --> 47:32.734
- What are you doing here?
- We need to talk.

47:32.759 --> 47:34.679
Let's go someplace.

47:34.960 --> 47:36.726
Where are we going then?

47:36.751 --> 47:38.201
Your house.

47:38.226 --> 47:40.061
You can give me a ride.

47:46.562 --> 47:50.060
I'll... I'll get us some drinks.

47:50.085 --> 47:52.461
Actually Jamie...

47:52.486 --> 47:56.159
I need you to go ahead
and get started on your homework, alright.

47:56.191 --> 48:00.931
Melanie and I, we need to have
a conversation in private.

48:01.641 --> 48:03.289
Mom, I...

48:03.314 --> 48:05.011
Jamie, please.

48:05.620 --> 48:09.626
- I don't have much homework today, so maybe...
- OK, alright, you know what,

48:09.651 --> 48:13.159
why don't you go ahead and watch
something in my room, OK?

48:14.620 --> 48:15.937
- Come on.
- OK.

48:17.453 --> 48:18.655
Thank you.

48:27.446 --> 48:28.681
What now?

48:29.214 --> 48:30.516
You tell me.

48:31.907 --> 48:33.422
What happened to Kevin?

48:33.914 --> 48:36.102
My guess is a heart attack.

48:37.132 --> 48:39.007
But he was your friend.

48:39.032 --> 48:41.578
Friends don't turn on each other, do they?

48:42.070 --> 48:45.383
I'm not your friend,
does that mean you're going to kill me?

48:47.268 --> 48:48.718
I hope not.

48:49.857 --> 48:51.858
It's your turn, Hayley.

48:52.791 --> 48:53.881
What?

48:54.757 --> 48:56.882
Kevin and I kept up our part of the agreement.

48:56.907 --> 48:58.772
Now it's your turn.

48:58.975 --> 49:02.007
But I never had any kind of agreement.

49:02.389 --> 49:05.498
This would be so much
easier if you would just do

49:05.523 --> 49:07.012
what you said you would do.

49:07.037 --> 49:10.200
- No, I never said that I...
- It was what you wanted.

49:10.614 --> 49:14.114
Besides... if you don't do this...

49:14.864 --> 49:18.793
things will get so messy.

49:19.695 --> 49:22.973
You have such a nice clean house.

49:24.409 --> 49:26.808
Such a nice clean life.

49:28.033 --> 49:32.652
Such a nice little family.

49:34.677 --> 49:37.028
Doesn't need to get messy.

49:37.053 --> 49:38.097
OK.

49:38.891 --> 49:40.933
What do you want me to do?

49:45.539 --> 49:46.774
Lisa.

49:47.563 --> 49:49.266
She has it coming.

49:49.471 --> 49:51.842
Just like Kevin's boss and your ex, trust me.

49:51.867 --> 49:54.485
Don't let your conscience get to you.

49:58.609 --> 50:00.332
Did Kevin have it coming?

50:00.357 --> 50:01.523
Don't...

50:03.304 --> 50:05.404
Don't make this harder than it needs to be.

50:05.429 --> 50:08.106
We have a really solid plan here.

50:08.530 --> 50:10.361
- Why?
- Why what?

50:10.386 --> 50:11.707
Why have a plan?

50:12.561 --> 50:14.428
Why pull Kevin and I into this.

50:14.453 --> 50:18.719
You were perfectly capable
of killing on your own.

50:19.245 --> 50:22.780
Why not just take care of Lisa by yourself.

50:22.805 --> 50:27.530
Why complicate things by having two... no,

50:27.830 --> 50:30.788
three more murders.

50:31.782 --> 50:34.076
You ever think about your alibi?

50:34.101 --> 50:35.169
I don't need one.

50:35.194 --> 50:36.485
You sure?

50:36.875 --> 50:39.652
You know I hear stories all the time about men,

50:39.677 --> 50:41.768
women, all convicted by circumstance.

50:41.793 --> 50:43.828
It doesn't matter if you're innocent.

50:44.120 --> 50:46.848
They can prove you were with Kevin.

50:46.873 --> 50:49.384
At the motel, you must've touched doors,

50:49.409 --> 50:51.676
 doorknobs, who knows what else.

50:51.701 --> 50:55.036
Kind of suspicious when you
didn't call for help, too.

50:55.456 --> 50:58.020
- I didn't need to...
- Then there's motive.

51:01.701 --> 51:03.481
Your ex-husband dies,

51:03.506 --> 51:06.264
Kevin's ex-lover dies, well...

51:06.595 --> 51:09.430
maybe you killed them both
so you could be with Kevin,

51:09.455 --> 51:11.821
and when he didn't appreciate it...

51:12.643 --> 51:13.877
you killed him.

51:16.011 --> 51:17.400
What happened to the heart attack?

51:17.425 --> 51:20.308
Well I'm sure an anonymous tip about poison
can clear that up?

51:20.333 --> 51:21.584
Poison?

51:21.609 --> 51:24.859
And that's just one scenario
the police will see.

51:25.597 --> 51:27.206
Think of your daughter.

51:27.802 --> 51:30.800
Without you she has... no one.

51:32.431 --> 51:34.368
You wanna risk that...

51:34.393 --> 51:37.116
with whatever the police might find and believe?

51:38.960 --> 51:40.587
Let's take a drive.

51:41.314 --> 51:42.845
Go down to the theater.

51:42.870 --> 51:46.420
- The theater, why?
- I think that's the best place to do it.

51:46.857 --> 51:48.258
No but, see Jamie...

51:48.283 --> 51:49.964
She'll be fine here.

51:52.286 --> 51:53.413
Look.

51:55.553 --> 51:57.709
You know what I'm capable of?

51:58.788 --> 52:01.241
There's no point in backing out now.

52:01.591 --> 52:05.669
It'll just mean things will happen
that neither of us want.

52:06.576 --> 52:08.778
Don't overthink this, just do it.

52:10.245 --> 52:11.914
I'll be in your car.

52:37.231 --> 52:40.270
Mom, what's going on?

52:41.177 --> 52:42.551
I don't know.

52:43.486 --> 52:46.076
Does she have something to do...

52:47.073 --> 52:49.799
with... with Dad?

52:52.641 --> 52:54.576
What are you gonna do?

52:59.554 --> 53:01.640
I need to go, alright.

53:01.665 --> 53:05.726
I'm gonna be right back,
but I want you to stay here.

53:16.033 --> 53:17.969
No performance tonight.

53:18.893 --> 53:20.627
Come on, I'll show you around.

53:25.946 --> 53:28.530
This is where all the excitement happens.

53:28.555 --> 53:30.796
My aunt sometimes likes to go backstage,

53:30.821 --> 53:33.827
not like she needs to but...
she likes to pretend

53:33.852 --> 53:36.859
she has some influence over how a show turns out.

53:36.884 --> 53:39.656
Honestly, she has no idea how
to run a theater, all the...

53:39.681 --> 53:41.595
So you can't cover it.

53:42.345 --> 53:43.445
What?

53:43.687 --> 53:44.703
OK.

53:44.728 --> 53:46.718
Just do the best you can for me.

53:47.063 --> 53:48.516
OK thanks.

53:48.858 --> 53:49.983
You're here late.

53:50.008 --> 53:52.110
I, I forgot something.

53:52.135 --> 53:54.002
Guess what I just discovered.

53:54.417 --> 53:55.439
What?

53:55.744 --> 53:58.469
The Andrews Performing
Art Theater is a rat's nest

53:58.494 --> 54:00.599
of incompetency thanks to you.

54:00.624 --> 54:03.811
You wanna guess why, why this
theater is going to fail?

54:03.836 --> 54:06.321
Do you even know what you did?

54:07.923 --> 54:11.374
Everything I do is for this theater
and its legacy.

54:11.399 --> 54:14.549
My legacy, thank you very much.

54:14.574 --> 54:18.036
Do you just go out of your way to prove
how worthless you are?

54:19.777 --> 54:22.728
You failed to pay the premium
for our insurance bond

54:22.753 --> 54:25.311
in time for it to go into effect.

54:25.336 --> 54:28.963
No, I paid as soon as I
could get you to transfer money

54:28.988 --> 54:29.955
into the theater's operating account.

54:29.980 --> 54:35.020
Remember clumsy Gretchen
who broke her leg a couple of weeks ago?

54:35.045 --> 54:37.178
Guess what, she's suing us.

54:37.203 --> 54:40.606
And because of you, our
insurance doesn't cover it.

54:40.873 --> 54:44.880
So I'm gonna take an allotment out of your salary

54:44.905 --> 54:46.961
every month until it's paid off.

54:46.986 --> 54:49.017
I think that's fair, yeah?

55:00.055 --> 55:01.155
Come out.

55:07.073 --> 55:08.173
Open this.

55:14.052 --> 55:15.202
Careful.

55:15.372 --> 55:17.114
That'll stop a person's heart in 20 seconds.

55:17.139 --> 55:18.669
It's not cheap, either.

55:19.735 --> 55:21.712
This is what you killed Kevin with.

55:21.923 --> 55:23.157
It's effective.

55:23.743 --> 55:25.559
Listen Melanie, you still have time...

55:25.584 --> 55:28.785
At 3 PM every day, my aunt demands

55:28.810 --> 55:30.508
not to be disturbed for 15 minutes

55:30.533 --> 55:32.220
while she takes a power nap.

55:32.588 --> 55:35.063
And at that time tomorrow,
after she goes into her office,

55:35.088 --> 55:38.634
wait five minutes and sneak
in and inject her in the neck

55:38.659 --> 55:40.699
with the contents of that syringe.

55:40.724 --> 55:42.919
She'll be dead before she can make a sound.

55:43.072 --> 55:45.196
Then walk out as if nothing happened.

55:45.221 --> 55:46.932
Get rid of that syringe.

55:48.177 --> 55:49.018
Melanie please.

55:49.043 --> 55:51.638
Come on,
I'll show you where her office is.

55:54.396 --> 55:55.546
There it is.

55:57.522 --> 55:59.319
And where will you be?

55:59.612 --> 56:01.919
I'll be out with friends, coffee.

56:02.180 --> 56:03.852
Alibi, remember?

56:05.341 --> 56:06.491
Alibi?

56:06.923 --> 56:09.587
I don't think that I can do this.

56:11.458 --> 56:13.579
Hayley, this plan has gotta work.

56:13.604 --> 56:15.151
For both of us.

56:15.871 --> 56:17.021
You saw that.

56:18.217 --> 56:21.230
You saw what kind of person she is.

56:24.328 --> 56:27.117
What's weird is, she wasn't always like this.

56:27.929 --> 56:30.478
When I was a kid, I used to go over to her house

56:30.503 --> 56:31.874
during the summer.

56:33.432 --> 56:35.369
I used to have so much fun back then.

56:36.182 --> 56:38.516
I would beg my dad to take me over to Aunt Lisa's

56:38.541 --> 56:40.471
so I could go swimming.

56:41.406 --> 56:42.768
What happened?

56:46.347 --> 56:47.973
My dad killed himself.

56:48.188 --> 56:49.288
What?

56:50.108 --> 56:51.208
Why?

56:53.581 --> 56:55.292
My grandfather was a man of passion,

56:55.317 --> 56:58.292
he had an unquenchable love for the arts.

56:58.551 --> 57:00.715
He used every penny to build

57:00.740 --> 57:03.377
the Andrew Performing Arts Theater.

57:04.886 --> 57:07.625
Unfortunately, he was too much a lover
of the theater

57:07.650 --> 57:10.017
and not enough of a businessman.

57:10.042 --> 57:13.553
This place was hanging by a thread
when he passed away.

57:14.127 --> 57:16.217
It passed to my dad and Lisa.

57:17.444 --> 57:19.357
Knowing how much the theater meant to my grandpa,

57:19.382 --> 57:21.266
my dad worked his fingers to the bone

57:21.291 --> 57:23.398
bringing the theater back from the brink.

57:24.054 --> 57:26.532
Aunt Lisa, she thought he was stupid

57:26.557 --> 57:29.450
for putting so much time and resources into it.

57:29.475 --> 57:32.244
She wanted to cut losses, sell it.

57:33.916 --> 57:38.664
The theater not only survived but it...
thrived because of my dad.

57:38.874 --> 57:41.257
It became the premiere theater in the city.

57:42.791 --> 57:45.955
But Lisa always knew how to manipulate people.

57:46.241 --> 57:48.889
When she saw the theater
was worth something...

57:49.608 --> 57:52.392
she took all he credit for the success,

57:52.417 --> 57:55.327
and convinced the board
members to push my dad out.

57:57.314 --> 58:01.914
This not only destroyed my dad financially,
but it... broke him.

58:03.868 --> 58:07.837
The theater had come to mean as much to him
as it did to my grandpa...

58:08.200 --> 58:12.118
 to lose it in a betrayal,
by a close family member it was...

58:13.691 --> 58:15.417
it was more than he could deal with.

58:16.773 --> 58:18.686
I tried to poison Lisa once before.

58:18.711 --> 58:19.912
You did?

58:20.734 --> 58:21.743
Yeah.

58:22.141 --> 58:24.757
And when she started feeling sick,
she went to the hospital.

58:24.782 --> 58:26.303
But I was really careful.

58:27.156 --> 58:30.084
They weren't quite sure if she
was intentionally poisoned.

58:30.109 --> 58:33.351
I was questioned by the police
and for a time maybe suspected

58:33.376 --> 58:36.797
but eventually...
they wrote it off as a fluke.

58:37.819 --> 58:41.381
But that's why I have to
come up with a better plan, you see.

58:41.688 --> 58:43.366
If I'm a suspect...

58:44.334 --> 58:46.178
I wouldn't inherit the theater.

58:47.232 --> 58:49.926
She's going to destroy everything...

58:49.951 --> 58:54.863
my father and grandfather
gave their lives to create.

58:54.888 --> 58:56.458
She has to be stopped.

58:57.089 --> 58:59.847
I... I will build it back up to what it should be,

58:59.872 --> 59:01.565
without the theater...

59:03.342 --> 59:04.815
I have nothing.

59:07.267 --> 59:08.590
Nothing at all.

59:10.474 --> 59:12.087
If I do this...

59:13.041 --> 59:16.282
if I agree to kill your aunt,

59:17.199 --> 59:21.581
promise to never bother Jamie or me again.

59:22.845 --> 59:24.300
Of course.

59:26.043 --> 59:27.255
Of course.

59:53.155 --> 59:55.678
Excuse me, Mrs. Udall.

59:56.101 --> 59:57.889
Jerry has another visitor.

59:59.053 --> 01:00:00.194
Thank you.

01:00:07.321 --> 01:00:09.438
I didn't expect you to be here.

01:00:11.196 --> 01:00:13.156
I wanted to see him.

01:00:13.757 --> 01:00:16.235
I wouldn't have blamed you,
if you hadn't come.

01:00:19.237 --> 01:00:20.473
Jerry...

01:00:21.843 --> 01:00:23.807
He didn't deserve this.

01:00:28.101 --> 01:00:29.242
You know he...

01:00:29.873 --> 01:00:34.308
He wasn't perfect, but he...
had some virtues.

01:00:34.804 --> 01:00:36.725
You're a saint Hayley,

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:39.116
 putting up with my son the way you did.

01:00:42.046 --> 01:00:43.522
It's my fault.

01:00:43.921 --> 01:00:45.417
Don't say that.

01:00:46.053 --> 01:00:47.952
It's what he would have said.

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:50.327
And Jerry was never right.

01:00:51.074 --> 01:00:53.303
He was blind when it came to you.

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.373
Mrs. Udall?

01:00:57.928 --> 01:00:58.991
Sorry.

01:00:59.016 --> 01:01:01.686
Ms. Udall, we have a few more questions for you.

01:01:01.982 --> 01:01:03.319
If you don't mind.

01:01:12.367 --> 01:01:14.711
Is there a reason why I'm here?

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:19.007
Am I being charged with a crime?

01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:23.261
No, I just, I wanna clarify
a few things with you.

01:01:26.366 --> 01:01:27.366
OK.

01:01:28.731 --> 01:01:32.130
So prior to your ex-husband's murder,

01:01:32.653 --> 01:01:36.528
we called you to clarify Kevin Moore's alibi,
is that right?

01:01:38.363 --> 01:01:41.621
You actually came down to my work.

01:01:42.266 --> 01:01:45.434
That's how it happened... but yes.

01:01:46.096 --> 01:01:47.191
Alright.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:48.711
Well...

01:01:49.212 --> 01:01:51.891
we found Kevin yesterday in a motel.

01:01:53.393 --> 01:01:56.211
He's dead, apparently of natural causes.

01:01:57.882 --> 01:01:58.999
That...

01:02:00.748 --> 01:02:02.499
That's horrible.

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:08.460
See Kevin was a suspect
in the murder of his boss.

01:02:09.749 --> 01:02:11.296
Apparently he had an affair with, but...

01:02:11.321 --> 01:02:15.375
he was released as a suspect,
based on you corroborating his alibi.

01:02:16.289 --> 01:02:18.156
A couple days later...

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.469
your husband turns up dead and now...

01:02:22.243 --> 01:02:23.563
Kevin's dead.

01:02:25.768 --> 01:02:27.477
Doesn't make any sense.

01:02:30.268 --> 01:02:31.752
Was that a question.

01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:36.353
'Cause if it is, no, it doesn't make any sense.

01:02:37.251 --> 01:02:38.837
You can't clear that up for me.

01:02:40.905 --> 01:02:42.766
I wish I could.

01:02:45.123 --> 01:02:47.186
Is there something you wanna tell me?

01:02:53.256 --> 01:02:54.715
Can I go now?

01:02:58.620 --> 01:02:59.725
Sure.

01:03:01.912 --> 01:03:03.093
Thank you.

01:03:18.088 --> 01:03:21.471
I want this fixed by this afternoon, no excuses.

01:03:22.639 --> 01:03:25.666
I'll be in my office, no interruptions.

01:04:52.283 --> 01:04:54.843
I'm sorry... I'm really...

01:04:54.868 --> 01:04:56.186
Who are you?

01:04:56.211 --> 01:04:57.547
I'm sorry, I think I just...

01:04:57.572 --> 01:04:59.908
Everybody knows...
I don't like to be disturbed.

01:04:59.933 --> 01:05:01.291
I got turned around in the bathroom.

01:05:01.316 --> 01:05:02.783
- What are you doing in here?
- I'm sorry.

01:05:02.808 --> 01:05:05.337
- Who let you up here?
- I'm sorry.

01:05:06.056 --> 01:05:08.946
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

01:05:14.036 --> 01:05:15.216
Melanie.

01:05:16.316 --> 01:05:20.880
How many times haven't I told you
to make sure no one disturbs me?

01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:25.417
Thanks for the coffee.

01:05:39.244 --> 01:05:40.884
What happened?

01:05:40.909 --> 01:05:43.760
- I was trying, I was standing...
- Not hard enough.

01:05:43.785 --> 01:05:46.616
- She woke up.
- You still could've done it.

01:05:46.955 --> 01:05:50.892
- I warned you what would happen.
- No!

01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:57.271
I hope you kissed Jamie goodbye this morning.

01:06:27.398 --> 01:06:30.015
Hi, it's Jamie, I'll call you back.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:34.820
Jamie, come on answer, all right?
Please, call me.

01:06:46.315 --> 01:06:48.030
Hi, it's Jamie.

01:06:51.366 --> 01:06:53.368
That was the greatest.

01:06:53.393 --> 01:06:54.897
Cannot believe it.

01:06:58.335 --> 01:06:59.618
Jamie this is your mother.

01:06:59.602 --> 01:07:02.536
Please call me when you get this, thank you.

01:07:04.235 --> 01:07:05.820
See you tomorrow!

01:07:23.532 --> 01:07:24.782
Jamie?

01:07:26.846 --> 01:07:28.096
Jamie!

01:07:48.025 --> 01:07:50.189
Hey Jamie, where are you?

01:07:50.759 --> 01:07:52.973
- I love you.
- <i>Jamie?</i>

01:07:52.998 --> 01:07:54.669
<i>She's in the trunk.</i>

01:07:57.611 --> 01:08:00.161
OK Melanie... please.

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:01.759
<i>She's brave.</i>

01:08:02.158 --> 01:08:03.447
<i>Trying to be anyway.</i>

01:08:03.783 --> 01:08:04.939
Please.

01:08:05.859 --> 01:08:07.867
<i>You should've stuck with the plan.</i>

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:11.001
Don't hurt her, OK?

01:08:11.619 --> 01:08:14.712
<i>You should've kept your side of the pact, Hayley.</i>

01:08:16.736 --> 01:08:20.703
- Melanie.
- Even a moron like Kevin kept his word.

01:08:20.728 --> 01:08:23.281
<i>Yeah, and look at what happened to him.</i>

01:08:23.305 --> 01:08:25.875
Trust me, it's gonna be much worse for you.

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:30.273
- Melanie.
<i>- This afternoon was the perfect time.</i>

01:08:30.298 --> 01:08:32.444
I know and I tried, I did.

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:35.194
<i>I warned you not to doubt me.</i>

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:37.772
Give me another chance... please?

01:08:37.796 --> 01:08:38.859
<i>At 8.</i>

01:08:40.314 --> 01:08:42.368
Tonight's production is a VIP performance.

01:08:42.394 --> 01:08:44.363
<i>A lot of donations will
be coming into he theater.</i>

01:08:44.895 --> 01:08:47.005
<i>Lisa will stay late to tally it up.</i>

01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:48.478
<i>Do you still have the syringe?</i>

01:08:48.502 --> 01:08:51.323
<i>No, I... I got rid of it.</i>

01:08:52.078 --> 01:08:53.604
What are you going to use?

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:54.888
I don't know.

01:08:55.437 --> 01:08:56.493
<i>Think of something.</i>

01:08:56.518 --> 01:08:57.612
I...

01:08:57.636 --> 01:08:58.642
<i>Knife, gun.</i>

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:01.618
- <i>It's gotta be quick but it also needs to be quiet.</i>
- I don't have a gun.

01:09:01.643 --> 01:09:02.859
Knife will work.

01:09:02.884 --> 01:09:04.246
But don't do it just once.

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:06.401
Do it three times to be safe.

01:09:06.426 --> 01:09:09.231
<i>Pick one that doesn't match
the others in your kitchen.</i>

01:09:10.298 --> 01:09:11.298
OK.

01:09:11.875 --> 01:09:15.240
<i>I'm sure you'll find a moment to get her alone.
You can do it then.</i>

01:09:15.265 --> 01:09:18.725
Oh no, but she...
she saw me today.

01:09:19.937 --> 01:09:21.779
Then you'll need to be quick.

01:09:21.804 --> 01:09:23.711
And where will you be?

01:09:24.001 --> 01:09:25.171
<i>Close enough.</i>

01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:30.756
I need to see Jamie.

01:09:32.069 --> 01:09:33.749
<i>Not until it's done.</i>

01:09:36.343 --> 01:09:37.912
I will not go through with this

01:09:37.937 --> 01:09:39.365
if you do anything to her.

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:41.929
I need to know that she's going to be OK.

01:09:42.193 --> 01:09:43.538
Tonight then.

01:09:45.727 --> 01:09:46.877
Melanie.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:15.870
Hello Ms. Udall.

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:18.761
Now would be a good time to
ask you a few more questions?

01:10:19.183 --> 01:10:21.362
No, no, it's not good.

01:10:22.029 --> 01:10:23.364
I'll be brief.

01:10:31.464 --> 01:10:32.630
Everything alright?

01:10:32.655 --> 01:10:35.769
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
What is it that you wanted?

01:10:36.862 --> 01:10:39.737
Oh, I wanna let you know that w...

01:10:40.848 --> 01:10:43.604
we confirmed Kevin is Jerry's murderer.

01:10:47.048 --> 01:10:48.962
Did Kevin know Jerry?

01:10:49.321 --> 01:10:53.283
No, I'm... I'm... I'm not sure, no.

01:10:55.082 --> 01:10:57.129
You know what I'm trying to figure out?

01:10:59.988 --> 01:11:01.769
Is why Kevin...

01:11:02.451 --> 01:11:04.550
would murder Jerry, I mean...

01:11:05.456 --> 01:11:08.322
 makes sense with Sarah, I mean he had motive.

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:10.768
Yet there's nothing that ties them together.

01:11:12.508 --> 01:11:13.761
I don't know.

01:11:14.835 --> 01:11:16.874
You know, a security guard at Landontech said

01:11:16.899 --> 01:11:18.741
he saw a woman leaving

01:11:18.766 --> 01:11:21.812
just about the time Sarah Olson was murdered.

01:11:23.598 --> 01:11:25.371
Now, did you know Sarah?

01:11:26.079 --> 01:11:28.489
I didn't kill Sarah Olson.

01:11:31.113 --> 01:11:32.661
I didn't ask that.

01:11:35.929 --> 01:11:37.749
I didn't know her.

01:11:40.637 --> 01:11:43.671
And how did you and Kevin meet?

01:11:45.285 --> 01:11:47.363
I work part time doing rideshare,

01:11:47.349 --> 01:11:49.574
and he was one of the fares that night.

01:11:51.278 --> 01:11:53.271
And when did you talk to him next.

01:11:53.552 --> 01:11:56.490
Sunday, we were going out.

01:11:56.515 --> 01:11:57.672
Going?

01:11:57.697 --> 01:12:00.319
Yeah, he canceled and I wasn't sure why.

01:12:03.915 --> 01:12:08.056
Well, we subpoenaed his phone records,
and...

01:12:10.067 --> 01:12:12.137
Apparently you called him just about the
time of

01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:14.137
his murdering your ex-husband.

01:12:15.054 --> 01:12:17.372
I was trying to reschedule.

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:20.535
And you got a text from him
a couple off days later,

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.020
just before he died,

01:12:22.309 --> 01:12:23.926
saying I'm ready.

01:12:24.218 --> 01:12:26.020
Isn't that cryptic?

01:12:27.461 --> 01:12:29.163
I didn't answer.

01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:31.852
Why not?

01:12:34.645 --> 01:12:37.511
He was being investigated by the police. I...

01:12:37.536 --> 01:12:41.317
just didn't think it was wise
to be dating somebody like that.

01:12:43.658 --> 01:12:45.924
I have three dead bodies Hayley.

01:12:47.484 --> 01:12:49.018
Do you understand that?

01:12:51.108 --> 01:12:53.967
And when I look at what the common connection is,

01:12:53.992 --> 01:12:56.146
on the surface I don't see one,

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:58.162
but when I look closer,

01:12:58.736 --> 01:13:01.814
and I see the threads that tied between all of them,

01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:04.285
do you know where they dead end?

01:13:05.862 --> 01:13:07.495
They dead end with you.

01:13:11.233 --> 01:13:14.765
I'm really sorry detective,
I wish that I could help you.

01:13:15.593 --> 01:13:16.960
Then help me.

01:13:20.488 --> 01:13:22.738
I think it's time that you go.

01:13:24.876 --> 01:13:25.910
OK.

01:13:29.334 --> 01:13:33.608
If you want, make this easier
on yourself and everyone,

01:13:33.898 --> 01:13:35.615
you know how to find me.

01:14:42.927 --> 01:14:44.709
Having a little heart to heart?

01:14:47.505 --> 01:14:49.559
He didn't look like the nicest guy.

01:14:49.584 --> 01:14:50.903
No he didn't.

01:14:52.414 --> 01:14:54.725
So how'd things go with the ex-wife this time.

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:57.578
She knows something she's not telling us.

01:14:58.883 --> 01:15:01.071
I'd like to put surveillance on her.

01:15:01.703 --> 01:15:03.623
Are you sure we'll get approval for that?

01:15:03.648 --> 01:15:06.001
'Cause you know the department
is cutting wherever they can.

01:15:06.026 --> 01:15:08.539
We'll just have to alternate shifts ourselves.

01:15:35.861 --> 01:15:38.353
- OK, I'm here.
- <i>About time.</i>

01:15:38.876 --> 01:15:41.206
Where is she?
Where is she?

01:15:43.115 --> 01:15:44.377
She's here.

01:15:45.411 --> 01:15:46.989
Let me see her.

01:15:47.365 --> 01:15:48.997
Show it to me first.

01:15:49.269 --> 01:15:50.380
What?

01:15:51.327 --> 01:15:52.692
<i>Your weapon.</i>

01:15:55.111 --> 01:15:56.321
<i>Perfect.</i>

01:15:57.175 --> 01:15:59.618
Alright, can I see her please.

01:16:05.992 --> 01:16:07.461
Jamie...

01:16:12.091 --> 01:16:14.493
Hurry up, show's over.

01:16:20.805 --> 01:16:23.180
- The show was wonderful.
- Oh thank you so much.

01:16:23.205 --> 01:16:25.673
- Have a wonderful evening.
- Thank you.

01:16:28.941 --> 01:16:31.441
Well, looks like everyone's gone.

01:16:31.682 --> 01:16:33.215
Is her car still there?

01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:38.773
I'm gonna go inside and take a look.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.171
I'll keep you posted.

01:17:26.317 --> 01:17:28.620
You... what are you doing here?

01:17:28.645 --> 01:17:31.027
- Lisa, listen to me.
- Who are you?

01:17:31.052 --> 01:17:35.024
Your niece, Melanie,
she wants you dead, not me.

01:17:35.049 --> 01:17:36.735
You were here this afternoon.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.862
I'm not here to hurt you.
I'm here to warn you.

01:17:40.283 --> 01:17:43.057
Just stay away from me.

01:17:43.416 --> 01:17:44.910
Don't worry, Lisa.

01:17:44.935 --> 01:17:46.658
I won't let her hurt you.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.951
Melanie, what is this all about?

01:17:50.535 --> 01:17:51.889
This is Hayley...

01:17:52.553 --> 01:17:54.102
and she's here to kill you.

01:17:54.631 --> 01:17:55.442
No.

01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:58.834
Only...
I won't let her abuse you.

01:18:00.836 --> 01:18:03.199
And when he police get here,
they'll see that...

01:18:03.433 --> 01:18:07.065
I was too late to save my favorite aunt...

01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:10.981
or stop her homicidal stalker.

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:12.255
Melanie!

01:18:12.288 --> 01:18:13.923
She deserves it.

01:18:13.957 --> 01:18:14.957
You saw it.

01:18:16.653 --> 01:18:19.832
She's horrible always tearing me down,
when she's the one

01:18:19.857 --> 01:18:22.146
destroying everything.

01:18:23.093 --> 01:18:26.973
And you...
all you had to do was your part.

01:18:28.317 --> 01:18:30.469
Instead you just got Jamie killed.

01:18:30.494 --> 01:18:31.837
Don't move!

01:18:48.908 --> 01:18:50.424
Hayley!

01:19:28.446 --> 01:19:29.796
Jamie.

01:19:33.651 --> 01:19:35.001
Jamie.

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:39.670
Jamie.

01:19:43.129 --> 01:19:44.379
Jamie.

01:20:04.035 --> 01:20:06.862
Shots fired, send backup.

01:20:20.851 --> 01:20:22.101
Hello!

01:20:22.554 --> 01:20:24.700
Hey, are you OK in there?
It's the police!

01:20:24.725 --> 01:20:27.742
I'm gonna try and break you out, OK?
Just stay back, OK?

01:20:36.486 --> 01:20:38.541
Alright stay back, OK?

01:20:46.279 --> 01:20:48.108
Hey, are you OK?

01:20:48.992 --> 01:20:51.061
- Where's my mom?
- I don't know.

01:20:53.755 --> 01:20:55.006
Come on!

01:20:57.587 --> 01:20:58.650
No!

01:21:03.731 --> 01:21:05.445
Stop!

01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:07.232
Mom!

01:21:07.257 --> 01:21:08.887
Stop fighting!

01:21:10.011 --> 01:21:11.104
Jamie!

01:21:11.129 --> 01:21:13.152
Mom!

01:21:13.445 --> 01:21:15.965
Let me go, no!

01:21:16.382 --> 01:21:17.840
Let me go!

01:21:24.071 --> 01:21:26.321
I told you to shut up!

01:21:29.797 --> 01:21:31.077
Jamie!

01:21:31.102 --> 01:21:32.281
Back here.

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:34.531
- Where is she?
- They, uh.

01:21:36.042 --> 01:21:37.744
Backup's on the way.

01:21:54.976 --> 01:21:56.178
Stay back.

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:57.718
Where are they?

01:21:58.011 --> 01:21:59.265
Jamie!

01:22:00.964 --> 01:22:03.392
- Don't, don't hurt her.
- Drop it.

01:22:03.417 --> 01:22:05.355
- What?
- Drop it.

01:22:06.035 --> 01:22:07.644
Slide it over here.

01:22:08.659 --> 01:22:10.964
OK, let my daughter go.

01:22:10.989 --> 01:22:13.886
I will when I have Lisa.

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:17.908
I want to Hayley...

01:22:18.362 --> 01:22:21.393
- but you're the one...
- Killing Jamie!!!

01:22:23.885 --> 01:22:26.745
- Please don't hurt her.
- Where's Lisa?

01:22:29.425 --> 01:22:31.049
Oh Aunt Lisa!

01:22:31.503 --> 01:22:34.995
Come out or I'm killing this innocent girl.

01:22:38.877 --> 01:22:41.611
Alright alright I'm here. I'm here.

01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:43.213
There you are.

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:45.306
You see Hayley...

01:22:45.799 --> 01:22:47.963
it's all about proper motivation.

01:22:48.158 --> 01:22:50.267
- Let Jamie go.
- No.

01:22:51.481 --> 01:22:53.616
We can still make this work.

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:56.363
On your knees!

01:22:56.616 --> 01:22:59.816
On your knees.

01:23:03.242 --> 01:23:04.442
Now Hayley.

01:23:05.329 --> 01:23:06.479
Kill her.

01:23:06.996 --> 01:23:08.096
How?

01:23:11.746 --> 01:23:13.998
Pick that up!

01:23:14.023 --> 01:23:17.263
Come on. Drop it... drop it!

01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:22.762
Pick it up.

01:23:23.862 --> 01:23:27.408
A knife would've been cleaner,
but we're way past that now, hmm?

01:23:28.025 --> 01:23:30.502
What do you hope to gain from all this?

01:23:30.804 --> 01:23:32.408
Money, right?

01:23:33.144 --> 01:23:37.168
Because it's always about money,
isn't Aunt Lisa?

01:23:38.314 --> 01:23:39.762
But not for me.

01:23:40.653 --> 01:23:43.684
For me, it's a little bit more, hm?

01:23:44.324 --> 01:23:48.925
For me, it's knowing that
I brought you to your end,

01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:54.363
and that I put a stop
to your greed and betrayal.

01:23:57.168 --> 01:23:59.293
I planned it so perfectly...

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.143
but one thing always bothered me about it all

01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:06.299
and it was that you wouldn't know
that I was behind it.

01:24:06.324 --> 01:24:08.969
You wouldn't know that you were paying

01:24:08.994 --> 01:24:12.087
for what you did to my family,

01:24:12.112 --> 01:24:14.275
did to your own family!

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.885
This isn't gonna work.

01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:18.344
The police, they've already seen you.

01:24:18.672 --> 01:24:22.422
It'll work, OK, just wait and see.

01:24:22.904 --> 01:24:24.748
You're insane.

01:24:25.834 --> 01:24:27.841
You're not gonna get away with this.

01:24:28.041 --> 01:24:30.021
Your plan has failed.

01:24:30.209 --> 01:24:32.426
It's fixable, I'll just have to frame you

01:24:32.451 --> 01:24:34.504
for the murders since it's come to that now.

01:24:34.529 --> 01:24:35.380
Now do it!

01:24:35.405 --> 01:24:37.848
- Stop this.
- Don't move!

01:24:37.873 --> 01:24:41.621
You can't, please, you can't!
Don't , don't

01:24:41.646 --> 01:24:43.458
You're crazy.

01:24:44.404 --> 01:24:46.044
I prefer cunning.

01:24:46.726 --> 01:24:48.451
OK, then you should do it.

01:24:48.728 --> 01:24:50.326
Kill her yourself.

01:24:53.545 --> 01:24:55.498
You want a job done right.

01:25:01.611 --> 01:25:04.361
You know what your biggest mistake was?

01:25:05.210 --> 01:25:09.423
Your mistake was thinking that we were all
capable of killing like you.

01:25:09.837 --> 01:25:12.899
- Hayley!
- We're backstage!

01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:16.946
Melanie.

01:25:18.792 --> 01:25:21.128
You took everything.

01:25:21.705 --> 01:25:24.393
You left us with nothing.

01:25:24.607 --> 01:25:27.924
You left me with nothing.

01:25:28.612 --> 01:25:31.649
- I was 14.
- No, no, Melanie.

01:25:31.674 --> 01:25:33.611
Stay away from me!

01:25:37.358 --> 01:25:38.408
I did it!

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.360
I did...

01:25:43.450 --> 01:25:44.700
I... I did it!

01:25:46.286 --> 01:25:47.536
I did it!

01:25:47.887 --> 01:25:49.841
I did it! I...

01:25:58.050 --> 01:26:00.737
Are you hurt, no? Fine.

01:26:01.174 --> 01:26:03.101
Good, OK.

01:26:03.126 --> 01:26:04.860
You guys both OK?

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.870
<i>Everything clear, everything good?</i>

01:26:08.895 --> 01:26:10.864
<i>I'll call paramedics.</i>

01:26:16.967 --> 01:26:19.811
Don't worry, we'll be going home soon, OK.

01:26:22.148 --> 01:26:24.244
- Hey guys.
- Hey.

01:26:24.269 --> 01:26:25.709
How we doin'?

01:26:26.988 --> 01:26:29.996
Hey, do you mind if I have a moment
with your mom in private?

01:26:31.167 --> 01:26:32.792
It's OK, yeah.

01:26:33.402 --> 01:26:35.253
Come on, let's get something
from the soda machine.

01:26:35.278 --> 01:26:37.214
I don't even like soda.

01:26:41.642 --> 01:26:43.962
So, how's your leg?

01:26:44.252 --> 01:26:47.853
Oh, there's a little chunk missing,
but I think I'll be fine.

01:26:49.808 --> 01:26:51.582
How about you? You uh...

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:54.488
you as OK as you keep saying you are?

01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.699
It depends.

01:26:58.578 --> 01:26:59.578
On?

01:26:59.905 --> 01:27:01.258
On...

01:27:01.954 --> 01:27:04.250
how much trouble I'm in.

01:27:04.603 --> 01:27:06.267
Well, euh...

01:27:06.619 --> 01:27:11.165
Lisa's in stable condition
and she's... been awake here and there,

01:27:11.190 --> 01:27:13.530
enough to corroborate everything
that happened at the theater.

01:27:13.555 --> 01:27:14.705
That's good.

01:27:15.298 --> 01:27:17.040
Melanie is in custody.

01:27:17.197 --> 01:27:21.033
She's been very vocal, and
she'll probably plead insanity.

01:27:22.221 --> 01:27:23.431
But I'm...

01:27:23.712 --> 01:27:26.626
happy to inform you
that you're no longer a suspect.

01:27:35.588 --> 01:27:36.738
Thank you.

01:27:39.081 --> 01:27:40.231
Thank you.

01:27:40.689 --> 01:27:45.132
Look, I'm... really... sorry about not...

01:27:45.157 --> 01:27:47.382
being able to tell you
everything that was happening, but...

01:27:47.407 --> 01:27:50.446
Hey, you were threatened by Melanie and...

01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:53.125
you didn't have a choice.

01:27:54.071 --> 01:27:56.219
Pretty sure the D.A. will see it the same way.

01:27:58.219 --> 01:28:00.656
You guys been through
a lot these last few days.

01:28:01.849 --> 01:28:03.438
It's a fresh start, huh?

01:28:03.971 --> 01:28:04.971
Yeah.

01:28:06.032 --> 01:28:07.082
Thanks.

01:28:11.826 --> 01:28:14.634
It's been a long night, you gotta be exhausted.

01:28:14.659 --> 01:28:19.037
Oh yeah... I'm actually starving.

01:28:19.062 --> 01:28:20.662
Yeah, me too.

01:28:21.898 --> 01:28:24.037
- Let's get some breakfast.
- Sure?

01:28:24.062 --> 01:28:25.430
Yeah, oh.

01:28:26.609 --> 01:28:27.820
Who is it?

01:28:30.281 --> 01:28:32.984
Somebody needs a ride to the airport.

01:28:33.203 --> 01:28:34.203
Oh.

01:28:35.329 --> 01:28:36.898
No, you know what?

01:28:37.586 --> 01:28:38.586
No.

01:28:39.245 --> 01:28:40.789
They can find somebody else.

01:28:40.814 --> 01:28:43.721
- Really?
- Yeah... come on.

01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:45.479
Let's go.
