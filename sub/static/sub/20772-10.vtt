<i>Previously on "Casual"...</i>

00:02.596 --> 00:04.325
Why are you giving my
nine-year-old a music sermon?

00:04.350 --> 00:06.477
We're trying to find
Alex's sister's Dad.

00:06.502 --> 00:09.090
Oh. Is your Mom still alive?

00:09.537 --> 00:11.957
- I think so.
- Could you ask her?

00:12.037 --> 00:14.057
There's something toxic in the air

00:14.751 --> 00:16.578
that no one wants to talk about.

00:16.672 --> 00:19.425
I just think you're making
my generation pay the price.

00:19.450 --> 00:21.188
Please vote yes on the moratorium.

00:21.330 --> 00:23.646
You're not poison. You know that, right?

00:25.063 --> 00:27.901
Casey, Pete Nako
has office space in Sacramento.

00:27.902 --> 00:29.571
Can you take a look on Friday?

00:29.572 --> 00:31.534
- What's in Sacramento?
- The next battle.

00:31.535 --> 00:33.788
Good news, I found your half brother.

00:33.789 --> 00:35.625
This is <i>my</i> thing.

00:35.626 --> 00:37.963
You can't just fucking insert yourself.

00:37.964 --> 00:40.552
This is when you leave.

00:40.553 --> 00:42.513
- Can we talk?
- Yeah, why don't you, uh...

00:42.514 --> 00:44.518
go to your hotel room
and give me a call?

00:44.519 --> 00:46.981
When somebody says
they're gonna be there for you,

00:46.982 --> 00:48.776
they have to actually show up.

00:48.777 --> 00:49.904
I'm here now.

00:57.961 --> 00:59.730
That was a good date.

01:03.826 --> 01:06.971
♪ I took my love, I took it down ♪

01:10.111 --> 01:13.747
♪ Climbed a mountain
and I turned around ♪

01:14.663 --> 01:17.758
♪ And I saw my reflection ♪

01:17.813 --> 01:21.040
♪ In the snow covered hills ♪

01:21.104 --> 01:25.481
♪ Till the landslide brought me down ♪

01:28.344 --> 01:30.737
Hai! Hai! Hai! Hai!

01:30.820 --> 01:34.199
I was afraid he was
gonna get kicked in the head.

01:34.493 --> 01:35.745
You know, in a way,

01:35.861 --> 01:37.666
karate is the original yoga.

01:37.750 --> 01:40.714
Eastern tradition appropriated
by white people in crisis?

01:40.715 --> 01:43.051
Who are you?

01:43.052 --> 01:45.480
Do you think that we'll ever have sex?

01:45.956 --> 01:49.039
Presumably?
I was banking on a spontaneous,

01:49.064 --> 01:51.151
- passionate romp.
- Oh.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.529
People singing and dancing
while we do it.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.198
No? That sounds right to me.

01:54.199 --> 01:56.704
Spontaneity dies at childbirth.

01:56.705 --> 01:58.708
- Libido does not.
- Hm.

01:58.709 --> 02:01.421
- Let's make a plan.
- We can do it in the office.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.468
- I prefer to keep my job.
- Huh.

02:05.180 --> 02:07.016
- Oh.
- Hey, buddy.

02:07.017 --> 02:08.895
- Look who I ran into.
- Yo.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.316
Jake's Mom said I could
go over before dinner.

02:11.317 --> 02:14.363
- Can I?
- Sounds like a plan.

02:14.364 --> 02:16.338
Sounds like a plan.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.745
Great, let's do it.

02:23.233 --> 02:26.409
Do you think people in the 12th century
were guilted into hiking?

02:26.448 --> 02:28.117
I feel like preindustrial
guilt was probably

02:28.142 --> 02:30.479
- a little less exercise related.
- Oh, wow.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.322
Fuck you, cotton gin.

02:32.475 --> 02:34.352
You still up for the spa later?

02:34.432 --> 02:38.870
I am totally up for that spa later.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.612
- Is that Alex?
- Who's that?

02:41.805 --> 02:45.102
- What'd he do? Steal a family?
- I know. Weird.

02:45.178 --> 02:47.012
- Okay, buddy.
- Uh, can we go say hi

02:47.013 --> 02:48.517
- for a second?
- Yeah.

02:52.148 --> 02:54.277
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:54.278 --> 02:55.655
Hey.

02:55.656 --> 02:57.909
- You're sweaty.
- Yeah, we hiked.

02:57.910 --> 02:59.593
- Hi.
- Did like... What we do?

02:59.618 --> 03:01.746
- Like, six, seven miles?
- Probably two miles.

03:01.769 --> 03:03.271
Okay. Felt like six or seven.

03:03.296 --> 03:05.633
I wanna sit down. My limbs hurt.

03:05.634 --> 03:08.054
- Okay, bug.
- Oh, uh, sorry, Judy,

03:08.055 --> 03:09.600
- Valerie, Jack.
- Hey!

03:09.601 --> 03:11.311
- That's Clark.
- Hi.

03:11.312 --> 03:13.900
Oh! You're... You're Alex's sister.

03:14.526 --> 03:16.739
Yup. How'd you guess?

03:16.740 --> 03:18.951
Gypsy blood. Mom was a two bit psychic.

03:18.952 --> 03:21.790
Ran a booth at the county fair.
You know the story.

03:21.791 --> 03:26.609
He told me about you.

03:26.885 --> 03:28.463
Yeah. Right.

03:29.365 --> 03:31.119
So what's been going on?

03:31.268 --> 03:34.357
Um, I don't... Yeah, not much.

03:34.399 --> 03:36.110
A lot. We should catch up.

03:36.111 --> 03:37.906
We should do dinner
at my place next week.

03:37.907 --> 03:39.701
- I'm in Dubai, remember?
- Oh.

03:39.702 --> 03:41.100
But let's, uh,
let's go to the phones and...

03:41.125 --> 03:43.500
Let me see. What about next week?

03:43.501 --> 03:46.548
- The week after?
- I can't do Monday or Thursday

03:46.549 --> 03:48.886
- of that week.
- Tuesdays are bad for me.

03:48.887 --> 03:51.260
- Wednesday?
- I can't do Wednesday, sorry.

03:51.349 --> 03:53.554
- All right.
- Friday.

03:53.772 --> 03:55.650
- Friday.
- Friday.

03:55.651 --> 03:56.985
- Great.
- Thanks.

03:57.010 --> 03:59.206
- Yeah.
- Okay, well, we should probably...

03:59.231 --> 04:00.785
Yeah, we gotta...

04:00.914 --> 04:02.377
Bye, kiddo.

04:03.542 --> 04:05.127
- It was great to meet you.
- Yeah, really nice

04:05.152 --> 04:06.480
to meet you guys.
See you in a few weeks.

04:06.505 --> 04:08.133
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

04:08.247 --> 04:09.636
See ya. Great to see you.

04:09.637 --> 04:11.306
Yup.

04:15.231 --> 04:17.402
That wasn't weird at all.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.293
Hey, you with me?

04:20.324 --> 04:22.727
- We have our plan.
- Our plan.

04:22.913 --> 04:24.425
Yes.

04:24.542 --> 04:26.421
All right, buddy.

04:26.754 --> 04:28.457
Let's go. I bet you're starving.

04:49.759 --> 04:51.261
Get up.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.819
A spotless table tells no story.

05:06.104 --> 05:07.982
- Now it's got character.
- Oh.

05:08.007 --> 05:09.589
Oh, you think this is funny?

05:09.590 --> 05:12.261
Or that I wouldn't notice
that all my wine is gone?

05:12.262 --> 05:14.473
Sorry. I had some work friends over.

05:14.474 --> 05:16.572
It was six bottles, Laura.

05:16.646 --> 05:18.014
We were celebrating.

05:18.107 --> 05:19.711
We won.

05:20.027 --> 05:21.908
Okay, all right.

05:22.115 --> 05:24.536
Well, this website says make a paste

05:24.537 --> 05:26.901
of rottenstone? What?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.281
Wait, no. No!

05:29.377 --> 05:31.235
This... This is on you.

05:31.425 --> 05:33.302
Remove the stain.

05:33.429 --> 05:35.447

06:53.882 --> 06:56.533
Okay, I need you
to take a look at something.

06:57.215 --> 06:59.492
Oh, no! He's...

06:59.741 --> 07:01.228
Sorry. Yeah. No.

07:01.229 --> 07:03.377
Uh... I-I-I don't know, it's...

07:03.442 --> 07:05.379
it's like a... it's a lot of skin.

07:05.404 --> 07:08.157
- Like so much skin.
- It's the same amount of skin.

07:08.243 --> 07:10.539
Right, but you...
You know when you see someone

07:10.540 --> 07:12.375
who wears glasses without their glasses?

07:12.376 --> 07:14.837
It's like that, but worse.

07:14.924 --> 07:16.885
Why would you shave it?

07:16.886 --> 07:19.098
The constant bombardment
of messaging to conform

07:19.099 --> 07:21.686
to unrealistic and arbitrary
beauty standards?

07:21.687 --> 07:23.583
- But you're a dude.
- I know!

07:23.854 --> 07:25.879
I know. I thought I was immune,

07:25.904 --> 07:29.451
but then I saw that fucking
Armani billboard on Sunset.

07:29.452 --> 07:31.205
- Oh, the David Beckham one?
- Yes.

07:31.206 --> 07:32.875
Can you close your fucking towel?

07:32.876 --> 07:34.838
Fine. Yes, the David Beckham one.

07:34.839 --> 07:36.048
- Yeah.
- Who I don't even like

07:36.049 --> 07:37.458
and he sucks at soccer now,

07:37.483 --> 07:39.657
but he's got that, you know, the tattoos

07:39.682 --> 07:41.475
with the pose with the white underwear

07:41.476 --> 07:43.647
- and the sex muscles.
- Fine. She won't even notice.

07:43.648 --> 07:46.207
- It'll be dark and you'll be...
- Rae, it's gonna be 4:00 p. m.

07:46.361 --> 07:48.104
And we'll be sober.

07:48.565 --> 07:49.822
Good luck.

07:56.298 --> 07:58.158
He should come with a warning label.

07:58.636 --> 08:01.432
- She's a grown woman.
- Yeah, with a kid.

08:01.514 --> 08:03.060
And he's never had his hands

08:03.061 --> 08:05.314
on that kind of technology before.

08:05.839 --> 08:07.945
Well, should we go
back in time and stop him?

08:07.946 --> 08:09.457
Like the X-Men?

08:09.700 --> 08:11.609
- Jack?
- Hi.

08:11.662 --> 08:15.814
Actually, I booked with him.
If that's okay if we switch?

08:16.004 --> 08:17.958
Oh, uh... Yeah.

08:18.050 --> 08:19.668
Hey.

08:20.387 --> 08:22.743
- Ready?
- Yeah.

08:35.208 --> 08:37.419
- Hey.
- Hey, so does Judy

08:37.421 --> 08:40.885
have any dietary restrictions?
Is she a vegetarian or...

08:40.886 --> 08:43.642
Do you order food by mail?
It's two weeks away.

08:43.897 --> 08:46.982
Um, listen, when a man
goes to get a massage,

08:46.983 --> 08:50.573
- does he usually get a... a...
- Happy ending?

08:50.642 --> 08:52.712
<i>Yeah. Would a fancy spa do that?</i>

08:52.744 --> 08:54.872
Or is that more of a... seedy strip mall

08:54.873 --> 08:56.375
in Glendale kind of thing?

08:56.400 --> 08:57.776
<i>We're a capitalist society, Val.</i>

08:57.801 --> 08:59.924
Only difference between fancy
and seedy is the opening bid.

08:59.925 --> 09:02.220
- So anywhere?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

09:02.221 --> 09:03.933
Google it. Oh, I gotta run. Bye.

09:05.019 --> 09:06.814
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:10.572 --> 09:12.073
We don't do that sort of thing here.

09:12.074 --> 09:14.225
Oh, yeah, no, I know.

09:14.412 --> 09:15.937
Of course.

09:22.237 --> 09:23.285
So...

09:23.903 --> 09:26.978
off to scenic Sacramento?

09:27.689 --> 09:29.954
- I'd like to visit.
- You should.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.499
Or, I don't know, screw it.

09:33.993 --> 09:36.702
Come along and unpack some boxes?

09:36.916 --> 09:39.429
You need bodies, right?

09:40.023 --> 09:41.993
No, I'm serious. I can make it work.

09:42.199 --> 09:45.451
Laura, I can't pay you.

09:45.767 --> 09:47.978
I mean, I can't feed you,
I can't house you.

09:47.979 --> 09:50.451
I don't even know
where I'm sleeping yet.

09:50.735 --> 09:52.905
- But I wanna help.
- Help here.

09:52.906 --> 09:55.034
I mean, there's Skid Row,

09:55.210 --> 09:57.610
- immigration, housing...
- I want to help <i>you.</i>

09:58.918 --> 10:02.208
I mean... you were my favorite intern.

10:03.218 --> 10:05.305
You're gonna do great things here.

10:27.726 --> 10:28.931
You okay?

10:28.995 --> 10:30.869
Can we maybe close the curtains?

10:31.357 --> 10:33.305
They are closed.

10:33.403 --> 10:36.241
They really are just for
aesthetic purposes, huh?

10:40.292 --> 10:43.957
Ooh, somebody's smooth down there.

10:44.013 --> 10:47.055
Yeah, well, typically I'm
trimmed, not shorn.

10:47.056 --> 10:48.600
Have you thought about blackout shades?

10:48.601 --> 10:50.829
- Shh.
- Okay.

10:58.286 --> 11:00.001
What's wrong?

11:08.181 --> 11:09.993
Intellectually I know
this isn't a big deal.

11:10.018 --> 11:11.604
I promise it's not.

11:12.233 --> 11:15.696
Right, but millennia
of masculine bullshit

11:15.697 --> 11:18.158
is in our DNA. Virility is like...

11:18.197 --> 11:19.738
the center of the male psyche.

11:19.802 --> 11:22.877
- Not war?
- That's virility adjacent.

11:22.991 --> 11:24.926
You know this isn't about you. Right?

11:24.951 --> 11:26.920
Of course.

11:27.929 --> 11:30.130
We'll have other chances.

11:56.737 --> 11:59.609
In my day, M&Ms were either
chocolate or peanut.

12:00.035 --> 12:03.498
Now you got crispy, mint, pretzel.

12:03.668 --> 12:06.772
- All sorts of nonsense.
- Our moral order's collapsing.

12:07.007 --> 12:08.583
You got that right.

12:36.817 --> 12:39.401
A week? Is that
how little I mean to you?

12:39.841 --> 12:41.552
Impotence is not an emergency.

12:41.577 --> 12:43.621
- Don't say "impotence."
- Erectile dysfunction?

12:43.622 --> 12:45.124
Okay, now you're just being cruel.

12:45.125 --> 12:46.711
Is your self-worth really so defined

12:46.712 --> 12:48.798
- by your sexual prowess?
- Yeah, it is.

12:48.799 --> 12:50.719
Absolutely. Why do you think men spend

12:50.720 --> 12:53.172
$4 billion a year on Viagra and Cialis?

12:53.201 --> 12:54.969
Some men just enjoy having sex.

12:55.062 --> 12:57.649
I'm 36. I've had sex
in every possible way

12:57.650 --> 12:59.869
given my anatomical structure.

13:00.197 --> 13:03.698
My sexual enjoyment is secondary to...

13:04.096 --> 13:06.930
well, tertiary
to the pleasure of my partner

13:07.169 --> 13:08.826
and the inflation of my ego.

13:09.522 --> 13:12.124
That is deeply narcissistic
and somehow...

13:12.304 --> 13:14.396
- weirdly charming.
- Hm. Thank you.

13:14.475 --> 13:16.144
Also, she had all these lights on.

13:16.145 --> 13:18.107
- It was the lighting's fault?
- Well, yeah.

13:18.108 --> 13:20.305
I think so.
Field conditions were a factor.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.066
Also, um...

13:25.540 --> 13:28.211
I may have over-gardened the hose area.

13:33.523 --> 13:35.938
Have you told Valerie
about our half-brother yet?

13:38.816 --> 13:41.571
So don't worry if it's rough, okay?

13:41.572 --> 13:43.657
That's why we workshop it, yeah?

13:43.701 --> 13:47.081
Just make sure
it stays under five minutes.

13:47.116 --> 13:48.769
I mean it. I'm gonna have a stop watch

13:48.794 --> 13:50.806
and a whistle. Maybe even a track suit.

13:50.923 --> 13:52.677
Thanks, everyone.

13:56.602 --> 13:58.270
Valerie, may we speak?

13:58.295 --> 13:59.965
Huh? Oh, yeah. Of Course.

14:03.469 --> 14:05.251
Good luck.

14:09.753 --> 14:11.856
Is this class too much for you?

14:12.341 --> 14:14.011
Uh, no.

14:16.390 --> 14:18.099
I-I mean, uh...

14:18.478 --> 14:21.132
uh, wait, what do you mean?

14:21.463 --> 14:24.643
I just feel like something's...

14:26.995 --> 14:28.539
- Do you know what I mean?
- I don't.

14:28.540 --> 14:30.459
Maybe if you finished that sentence?

14:30.460 --> 14:32.143
You don't seem invested.

14:32.255 --> 14:34.885
Or interested. Or sometimes even here.

14:34.886 --> 14:36.340
Rea... Okay.

14:36.430 --> 14:38.103
I mean...

14:38.309 --> 14:40.624
- 'cause I know I missed a class, but...
- Ah.

14:40.815 --> 14:44.786
Yeah, see, not just <i>a</i> class,

14:45.031 --> 14:49.540
but the journey that <i>is</i> class.

14:49.541 --> 14:51.501
- The journey?
- The personal

14:51.560 --> 14:53.996
- and emotional journey.
- Okay.

14:54.133 --> 14:56.261
That's what you're missing. My point is,

14:56.311 --> 14:59.827
maybe what would be best
would be if you took off

14:59.894 --> 15:01.695
the next couple of weeks...

15:01.898 --> 15:04.820
and then we can feel out
when you're ready

15:04.898 --> 15:07.000
to come back to class.

15:07.931 --> 15:10.039
Okay. Actually no, Joanna.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.834
- I'm not gonna do that...
- Hm.

15:11.835 --> 15:13.462
'Cause, um, we're not on a journey.

15:13.463 --> 15:15.720
This is a... This is a black box theater

15:15.819 --> 15:18.881
which I... for some reason,
paid $400 to be in.

15:19.391 --> 15:21.394
Okay, I'll pro-rate your refund.

15:21.395 --> 15:23.035
Thanks.

15:25.988 --> 15:27.699
Maybe you drove her toward something

15:27.700 --> 15:29.453
she wasn't ready for.

15:30.915 --> 15:32.697
She drove herself.

15:33.229 --> 15:34.482
I just gave her a name.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.095
- Why even do that?
- I don't know.

15:38.806 --> 15:40.511
I don't know.

15:40.726 --> 15:42.507
I thought we could do it together.

15:42.956 --> 15:44.619
Like we did with Dad's ashes.

15:44.692 --> 15:46.061
But that's not what she wanted.

15:46.274 --> 15:47.922
She wanted to wait.

15:48.116 --> 15:50.827
- Or do it alone.
- Okay, well, I hate that.

15:51.122 --> 15:52.833
That erosion of things.

15:52.983 --> 15:55.193
The slow drifting apart.

15:55.338 --> 15:56.819
I mean...

15:57.467 --> 15:58.970
sometimes it's quick, right?

15:58.971 --> 16:01.343
You break up, move away, say good-bye.

16:01.601 --> 16:03.400
But other times it happens...

16:03.605 --> 16:06.915
so gradually you hardly
even notice until finally...

16:09.324 --> 16:11.319
You know. I hate that.

16:11.645 --> 16:13.765
Is that what you think is happening?

16:14.669 --> 16:16.783
She hangs out with Jack
and I hang out with Judy.

16:16.833 --> 16:20.012
- But you like Judy.
- I like all people

16:20.013 --> 16:23.386
who are smart and funny
and attracted to me.

16:25.148 --> 16:27.519
But, yeah, I like Judy a lot.

16:28.739 --> 16:30.268
Great.

16:30.325 --> 16:31.958
Stop obsessing about Valerie.

16:32.037 --> 16:35.389
Go have fun with a woman
who is probably too good for you.

16:37.421 --> 16:39.008
One last question.

16:41.472 --> 16:42.764
Do you...

16:43.059 --> 16:44.525
prescribe Viagra?

16:44.937 --> 16:47.764
- Not to you.
- Fine.

16:48.069 --> 16:50.239
I mean, she doesn't even have
the balls to say it.

16:50.240 --> 16:53.942
Like, if you're gonna
kick somebody out of

16:54.206 --> 16:56.579
storytelling class, fucking say,

16:56.604 --> 16:58.356
"I'm kicking you outta
storytelling class."

16:58.381 --> 17:00.398
Maybe she was encouraging you to

17:00.732 --> 17:03.362
- find the words yourself?
- Oh, fuck off.

17:05.521 --> 17:07.844
I mean, why'd you take the class
if you weren't gonna show up?

17:07.983 --> 17:11.740
Because, um...
Amateur Playwriting was all sold out.

17:11.992 --> 17:13.973
- Oh.
- What about you?

17:14.371 --> 17:15.991
Uh...

17:16.140 --> 17:18.099
- I hate my day job.
- Oh.

17:18.588 --> 17:21.635
How original. You and everybody else.

17:21.699 --> 17:25.499
Right, but I only care
about me and I work in antiques,

17:25.569 --> 17:31.695
and basically sit in a store,
alone, full of old, dead stuff

17:31.740 --> 17:35.700
from other people's lives
and it's fucking boring.

17:37.877 --> 17:39.997
Have you ever had a happy ending?

17:41.508 --> 17:42.912
Uh...

19:25.843 --> 19:27.176
So...

19:27.275 --> 19:30.187
you know, you didn't
want him to switch or...

19:30.226 --> 19:33.273
No, I'm glad that he switched.
I mean, I would've... Yeah.

19:33.274 --> 19:34.776
I would've asked a patient to switch.

19:34.777 --> 19:36.793
But you don't fuck your patients.

19:37.031 --> 19:38.701
- Not that far gone.
- Right.

19:38.702 --> 19:40.010
So it's different.

19:40.037 --> 19:43.093
Of course you're insecure about it
because he's your boyfriend.

19:43.127 --> 19:45.297
Well, I'm... I'm not insecure, but...

19:45.298 --> 19:47.223
Oh, what? You're not thinking,

19:47.468 --> 19:49.471
"If he can't trust himself
to get a massage,

19:49.472 --> 19:51.300
how can he handle Dubai?"

19:54.501 --> 19:58.025
I just wish I could get into his head
without getting all...

19:58.365 --> 20:00.852
- therapist-y.
- You can.

20:01.623 --> 20:03.061
Just ask him.

20:37.336 --> 20:39.056
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:39.610 --> 20:41.940
Wow, it's really dark in here.

20:42.621 --> 20:44.859
Yeah, I'm trying to conserve.

20:45.126 --> 20:47.213
Enron. Never forget.

20:51.556 --> 20:53.595
Could it be cancer?

20:54.352 --> 20:58.339
I think it's more of a... a side effect
of cancer <i>treatment.</i>

20:59.487 --> 21:00.740
Huh.

21:00.949 --> 21:04.346
Okay, so, no cancer.

21:05.082 --> 21:06.583
That's good.

21:07.211 --> 21:09.550
When you wake up
in the morning, is it...

21:11.395 --> 21:13.817
Buoyant?

21:15.269 --> 21:17.809
There is a buoyancy. Yeah.

21:19.194 --> 21:21.182
So it's not physical.

21:22.116 --> 21:23.817
That's worse.

21:23.995 --> 21:26.473
If it were physical,
I'd have something to blame.

21:28.185 --> 21:30.688
The more you think about it,
the worse it'll get.

21:35.811 --> 21:37.731
You're not gonna tell anyone
at work about this, are you?

21:39.275 --> 21:40.859
I don't know.

21:41.989 --> 21:44.176
Think of the memes.

21:44.226 --> 21:45.526
Fuck.

21:53.805 --> 21:56.055
Don't be laughing at my neck pillow.

21:56.309 --> 21:58.079
Have you ever worn the neck pillow?

21:58.313 --> 22:00.685
'Cause once you've flows with,
you don't fly without.

22:01.319 --> 22:03.427
Should we not have slept together?

22:03.676 --> 22:05.195
Why would you say that?

22:05.688 --> 22:09.737
Uh, that day at the spa?

22:10.129 --> 22:12.047
- What about it?
- Um...

22:12.216 --> 22:14.100
Sorry, can you...

22:14.470 --> 22:17.184
- Okay.
- Okay, if you hadn't switched

22:17.185 --> 22:18.869
and you'd gone with the woman,

22:19.230 --> 22:21.327
what were you worried would happen?

22:21.412 --> 22:23.780
Jeez, can we talk about this
when I get back?

22:23.781 --> 22:25.268
My car's gonna be here any minute.

22:25.311 --> 22:27.245
Yeah, I mean, would you
have gotten a hand job?

22:27.246 --> 22:29.574
No, that's not...

22:29.835 --> 22:31.974
Hand jobs aren't like a thing...

22:32.298 --> 22:36.108
Okay, so what
would've happened before us?

22:37.016 --> 22:39.013
Val, come on, you don't...

22:39.437 --> 22:43.437
You know, it's just...
It's harder not to know.

22:45.777 --> 22:49.527
I would've gone with the woman
and spent the session disarming her.

22:49.667 --> 22:52.087
And after walking you to your
car I would've probably

22:52.088 --> 22:53.924
gone back in and tried
to book another appointment

22:53.925 --> 22:55.431
and not left until...

22:55.595 --> 22:57.498
she agreed to go out with me that night.

22:57.891 --> 23:01.169
And then after spending the weekend
fucking each other at a hotel,

23:01.398 --> 23:03.317
I would've probably
done it all over again

23:03.318 --> 23:04.651
with the front desk girl.

23:05.439 --> 23:07.325
I didn't want my mind
going anywhere near there,

23:07.326 --> 23:09.509
- so I-I switched it.
- Yeah, smart.

23:09.790 --> 23:11.824
No, it... Shit.

23:12.406 --> 23:14.115
My car's here.

23:14.747 --> 23:16.977
Have a great time in Dubai.

23:17.179 --> 23:19.271
Look, we are good.

23:19.285 --> 23:20.983
I just want you to know
that this is kinda...

23:21.082 --> 23:23.705
- We're good.
- Yeah, I know.

23:26.949 --> 23:28.612
I'll text you when I get there.

23:29.561 --> 23:31.233
Yeah, that'd be great.

23:58.554 --> 24:00.099
Too late to order in?

24:00.973 --> 24:02.847
I'm too far gone now.

24:03.188 --> 24:04.744
Maybe a backup pizza.

24:10.537 --> 24:11.818
You on your way?

24:11.872 --> 24:13.523
Clark's sitter just cancelled.

24:13.942 --> 24:17.465
Alex, I have eight pounds
of chicken here.

24:17.466 --> 24:19.010
Yeah, well, Jack's hale and hearty.

24:19.011 --> 24:21.463
Stop it. Stop.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.601
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- Nothing.

24:23.646 --> 24:25.816
<i>Okay, I mean,
there's gotta be someone else.</i>

24:25.841 --> 24:28.239
<i>Don't they have an Uber
for babysitters or something?</i>

24:28.447 --> 24:30.617
It's last minute, Val,
What's Judy gonna do?

24:30.618 --> 24:32.037
Bring him?

24:47.485 --> 24:49.990
- Am I supposed to feed you?
- I had a pupusa.

24:51.367 --> 24:53.237
Okay, well, um...

24:53.876 --> 24:56.433
just try not to set yourself
on fire while I'm here.

24:56.852 --> 24:58.422
Okay.

24:58.423 --> 24:59.635
Okay.

25:01.639 --> 25:03.265
You think she'll like this wine?

25:03.266 --> 25:05.311
So long as it makes her tipsy.

25:13.286 --> 25:14.561
- Come on in.
- Here you go.

25:14.586 --> 25:16.041
- Oh, that's... necessary.
- Yeah

25:16.067 --> 25:17.920
- Thank you.
- Hey. Good to see you.

25:17.921 --> 25:19.506
Thanks for having us.

25:19.507 --> 25:21.176
I'm less sweaty this time. I promise.

25:21.177 --> 25:23.013
- Okay. Thank you.
- And we're sitting

25:23.014 --> 25:25.769
at his table looking at this
broken waffle maker

25:25.770 --> 25:28.964
and there's 30 people staring at
us passing around this video.

25:29.026 --> 25:31.071
What? Wow.

25:31.072 --> 25:32.950
- I mean, how could I say no...
- Yeah. I... I lost it.

25:32.951 --> 25:34.391
- To that?
- I guess I didn't know

25:34.416 --> 25:36.874
- that you two worked together.
- That's right.

25:36.875 --> 25:40.608
So, did HR make you sign
a little consent form thingy?

25:41.185 --> 25:43.053
- I am HR.
- Yeah.

25:43.138 --> 25:44.724
- I wasn't gonna tell.
- No!

25:44.725 --> 25:46.769
That is highly controversial

25:46.770 --> 25:48.336
and somewhat awesome, guys.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.154
What about you two? How'd you reconnect?

25:50.230 --> 25:52.339
- Um.
- Um...

25:52.364 --> 25:55.286
Actually Valerie called me.
We went to lunch.

25:55.401 --> 25:57.165
A very awkward lunch, actually,
now that I think about it.

25:57.166 --> 25:58.918
I was pretty sure that I had blew it.

25:58.919 --> 26:00.769
And then I came by and killed a rat.

26:00.868 --> 26:02.619
Of course and, you know,
the rest is history.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.847
Was history... is history.
However that term has...

26:04.848 --> 26:08.333
Aw, you killed a rat for her.
That's so sweet.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.484
Well, technically,
the cat killed the rat.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.436
Are we hungry?

27:03.506 --> 27:05.574
Do you know Fleetwood Mac?

27:06.471 --> 27:08.831
I saw Stevie Nicks
at a Jamba Juice once.

27:09.406 --> 27:10.862
Come with me.

27:12.984 --> 27:14.321
Okay.

27:15.823 --> 27:17.074
Thanks for offering Laura.

27:17.075 --> 27:20.056
Oh, she was nine once, too.

27:20.212 --> 27:23.671
Now she's a teenager with Emoji tattoos.

27:23.672 --> 27:27.345
I know. Clark's principal sent an email

27:27.346 --> 27:29.307
a few weeks ago saying that
the kids are watching

27:29.308 --> 27:31.144
- porn at school.
- That's bullshit.

27:31.145 --> 27:33.065
When I was a kid, I always had
to wait up till midnight

27:33.066 --> 27:36.137
and hope HBO was showing
a documentary about some...

27:36.286 --> 27:39.019
woman orgasming in the woods.

27:39.078 --> 27:42.041
Now you can watch 24 year olds
getting sodomized during recess.

27:42.042 --> 27:43.884
The video said they were 18.

27:43.955 --> 27:46.592
No wonder why we're raising
a generation of sex addicts.

27:46.682 --> 27:49.337
- Eh, not a thing.
- What?

27:49.641 --> 27:51.141
Sex addiction?

27:51.185 --> 27:53.450
Yeah. It's a basic, human function.

27:53.899 --> 27:57.363
Um... um... I'm a therapist. It's real.

27:57.364 --> 27:58.658
You did a great job with this chicken.

27:58.659 --> 28:00.880
- Is there salt? Ah.
- Mm-hmm.

28:00.997 --> 28:02.708
But how can you be addicted
to your own biology?

28:02.869 --> 28:05.284
It's like saying
you're addicted to eating.

28:05.756 --> 28:08.260
Well, there are eating disorders

28:08.261 --> 28:10.618
and sex addiction
is an intimacy disorder.

28:10.701 --> 28:12.650
I just feel like there's
a disorder for everything now.

28:12.729 --> 28:15.214
Not liking winter, for instance,
is a disorder.

28:15.285 --> 28:17.403
Seasonal affective disorder.
My cousin has it.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.823
- It's that one.
- I have it, too.

28:18.848 --> 28:19.969
It's the one where I get really sad

28:19.994 --> 28:21.660
if it's not 80 degrees
and sunny outside?

28:21.685 --> 28:24.083
No, that's 'cause we're really spoiled.

28:24.084 --> 28:26.631
Why would someone ever say
that they were a sex addict

28:26.632 --> 28:28.425
if they didn't have, you know,
a disorder?

28:28.426 --> 28:30.429
- If they didn't need help?
- I don't know.

28:30.430 --> 28:32.141
Maybe they got caught. Needed an excuse.

28:32.142 --> 28:33.895
Hm, are you speaking from experience?

28:33.896 --> 28:35.649
- I plead the 5th.
- I'm grabbing some wine.

28:35.650 --> 28:37.537
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

28:37.570 --> 28:39.909
- Yes, thank you.
- Yeah.

28:43.039 --> 28:44.618
"Don't Stop" is a good one.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.719
Mom says it's about Bill Clinton.

28:49.468 --> 28:52.224
Also "Everywhere." That's a great one.

28:57.735 --> 28:59.416
What's wrong?

29:00.031 --> 29:01.277
Nothing.

29:01.576 --> 29:03.038
You're sad.

29:03.629 --> 29:05.169
Why are you sad?

29:07.797 --> 29:09.343
My friend moved away.

29:09.843 --> 29:11.899
Maybe you guys can Skype.

29:12.890 --> 29:14.783
She's not that kind of friend.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.438
What kind of friend is she?

29:21.407 --> 29:22.862
I'm not sure.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.361
Do you love her?

29:36.646 --> 29:38.269
You pick a song.

29:41.406 --> 29:43.376
More wine?

29:46.566 --> 29:48.695
So Jack and I went to Fresno.

29:50.716 --> 29:52.384
- Oh, yeah?
- I met Rich and his family.

29:52.385 --> 29:54.203
They're sweet.

29:54.766 --> 29:56.017
I'm sorry. Who's Rich?

29:56.058 --> 29:57.528
He's my half-brother.

29:57.730 --> 30:00.234
Yeah, they're really nice.
Just really... warm.

30:00.326 --> 30:03.408
Very down to earth. Grounded.

30:03.575 --> 30:05.411
Lovely. We spent the whole weekend.

30:06.873 --> 30:08.918
- Sounds great.
- And he's a butcher

30:08.969 --> 30:11.841
which I don't know why
I find that so endearing,

30:11.895 --> 30:17.249
but, um, I do and Jack
and Rich got along great.

30:17.394 --> 30:20.315
- Right? You liked him?
- Yeah, he's nice enough.

30:20.337 --> 30:22.420
- Yeah.
- Happy that worked out.

30:22.491 --> 30:25.075
Well, I hope you can meet him
'cause I invited him to L. A.,

30:25.076 --> 30:26.538
so maybe you will.

30:28.876 --> 30:30.295
Great.

30:32.048 --> 30:33.789
Who wants dessert?

30:36.595 --> 30:39.353
Uh... I think we're gonna head out.
Hit the road.

30:39.354 --> 30:40.439
- Yeah?
- No dessert for us,

30:40.440 --> 30:41.889
but dinner was great.

30:42.131 --> 30:43.988
- Thank you.
- Great seeing you, bud.

30:43.989 --> 30:45.950
- It was a really lovely dinner.
- Thanks for coming.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.537
- No. Thanks again.
- Yeah.

30:47.538 --> 30:48.904
- Nice to see you again.
- Good seeing you.

30:48.929 --> 30:49.991
- Take care. Good-night.
- Bye, guys.

30:50.016 --> 30:52.036
Thank you for coming.

31:01.691 --> 31:04.330
I don't know... I don't know
what my fucking problem is.

31:04.488 --> 31:08.245
Hey, listen,
you just euthanized your Dad...

31:09.247 --> 31:11.250
And then found out
that he wasn't your Dad,

31:11.382 --> 31:14.609
your brother's crazy,
your daughter's... 17,

31:14.977 --> 31:17.483
you can't cook... sorry.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.895
And, yeah, your boyfriend's a sex addict

31:20.896 --> 31:23.358
which apparently
isn't a... a real thing.

31:23.595 --> 31:26.492
So I think under the circumstances
you're doing all right.

31:35.843 --> 31:37.721
