WEBVTT

00:01.830 --> 00:03.695
Previously on "stalker"...

00:03.700 --> 00:04.826
Beth: Stalking is the unwanted

00:04.830 --> 00:07.219
Or obsessive attention
from one person to another.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.594
Beth: Why are you
following me, perry?

00:08.600 --> 00:10.295
You know
the answer to that.

00:10.310 --> 00:11.209
I'm obsessive.

00:11.210 --> 00:12.564
I went by your
restaurant last night,

00:12.580 --> 00:14.207
And I saw you
with brody.

00:14.210 --> 00:15.280
His real name is
perry whitely.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.907
Tracy: You think he
sought me out

00:16.910 --> 00:18.105
To get close to you?

00:18.110 --> 00:19.544
And to gain
enough information

00:19.550 --> 00:21.518
To find out
my real identity.

00:21.520 --> 00:22.612
Man: I have something
on that cop.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.509
Beth davis is not
her real name.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.045
It's michelle webber.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.084
Beth: This is
michelle webber.

00:27.090 --> 00:29.616
I'm calling to confirm
whether patient 5679

00:29.630 --> 00:33.521
The chief administrator at seattle
pacific psychiatric just called.

00:33.530 --> 00:36.227
Ray matthews was just
released this afternoon.

00:36.230 --> 00:38.562
Perry: We have a mutual
friend-- michelle webber.

00:38.570 --> 00:40.163
Michelle.
How is my girl?

00:40.170 --> 00:42.332
Beth: This kid has no
idea what he's just done.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.468
Where have you been?
You can't just leave like that.

00:44.470 --> 00:46.859
What if someone
recognized you?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.633
I just think that you're
under the impression

00:49.650 --> 00:50.970
That you're in control.

00:50.980 --> 00:52.744
I need this to be
a partnership, perry.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.104
Perry: What exactly
are we gonna do?

00:54.120 --> 00:55.315
We have to make
her vulnerable.

00:55.320 --> 00:58.085
We have to take away
her family here in LA,

00:58.090 --> 00:59.546
We have to
destroy her world

00:59.560 --> 01:02.552
So the only place
she can turn to is us.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.254
Ray: Excuse me.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.339
[loud thud]

01:36.690 --> 01:39.079
[floor creaks]

01:59.850 --> 02:01.648
Hello, beth.

02:23.970 --> 02:25.961
Hello, michelle.

02:25.980 --> 02:29.132
No, no, no! Aah!

02:30.810 --> 02:34.075
It's you and me forever.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.412
I told you that.

02:36.420 --> 02:37.569
No.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.410
[gasps]

02:42.160 --> 02:43.958
Beth?!

02:43.960 --> 02:45.655
You ok?

02:45.660 --> 02:48.459
I'm sorry.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.394
I had a bad dream.

02:52.130 --> 02:55.191
And I'm clumsy.

02:56.300 --> 02:59.201
Well, I think
it can be saved.

03:00.940 --> 03:02.669
Thanks.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.928
I don't know.
I know it was

03:17.930 --> 03:20.024
A white male
with dark hair,

03:20.030 --> 03:22.226
But to be absolutely
certain that it was

03:22.230 --> 03:24.494
Ray or perry,
I'm sorry.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.195
Thanks for looking
at them again,

03:26.200 --> 03:29.636
And all that's important
is that you're ok.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.904
What makes you so sure
that it was ray

03:31.910 --> 03:33.935
That attacked me?

03:35.810 --> 03:37.278
You know
about my past.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.100
I know what you've
told me.

03:39.110 --> 03:41.078
I know that your real name
is michelle webber,

03:41.080 --> 03:44.209
And I know that ray
is your ex-boyfriend,

03:44.220 --> 03:49.420
And I know what he did
to your family.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.127
He was my
first boyfriend.

03:52.130 --> 03:55.191
Ray was the bad boy.
I fell for him.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.725
I was so young,
I...

03:56.730 --> 04:01.270
I didn't even know what
obsessive nature looked like.

04:01.270 --> 04:03.534
He had this need
to control me.

04:03.540 --> 04:07.499
He'd get really jealous
over the smallest things.

04:07.510 --> 04:11.378
He'd sabotage my plans
and lie to my parents,

04:11.380 --> 04:14.475
Anything to get
what he wanted.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.779
But you did break up
with him?

04:19.920 --> 04:21.809
Yeah.

04:21.820 --> 04:25.450
When I left
for college,

04:25.460 --> 04:26.859
And then

04:26.860 --> 04:31.127
He started romancing
my sister Kimberly

04:31.130 --> 04:33.929
To make me jealous,

04:33.940 --> 04:36.864
But I wasn't.

04:36.870 --> 04:38.304
I was scared.

04:38.310 --> 04:39.800
I tried to tell her
about him,

04:39.810 --> 04:42.279
But she thought
that he liked her,

04:42.280 --> 04:44.874
And to my parents,
he was this...

04:44.880 --> 04:47.679
Great guy from
a wealthy family.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.981
I was at college
the night he set fire.

04:51.990 --> 04:54.914
His plan was
to save them.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.957
He wanted to be
the hero,

04:56.960 --> 05:01.500
But, uh, the house
burned too fast.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.093
It only took
a couple minutes,

05:03.100 --> 05:04.795
And...

05:05.830 --> 05:08.299
They never had a chance.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.364
I'm so sorry.

05:14.940 --> 05:19.241
He ruined my life,

05:19.250 --> 05:22.345
And he's trying
to do it again.

05:22.350 --> 05:24.216
My work, my friends,

05:24.220 --> 05:27.042
You, jack,
the team,

05:27.060 --> 05:30.382
That's my world.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.328
[knock on door]

05:35.430 --> 05:36.920
Can I come in?

05:36.930 --> 05:39.228
Yeah.

05:39.230 --> 05:40.129
Listen.

05:40.140 --> 05:43.861
I am so glad
you are better.

05:43.870 --> 05:44.803
Thanks.

05:44.810 --> 05:47.609
I'll let you two
visit.

05:47.610 --> 05:48.771
You don't have to go.

05:48.780 --> 05:51.340
I'll see you
at the office.

05:54.450 --> 05:55.315
You ok?

05:55.320 --> 05:58.915
Yeah. They're gonna
let me out today.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.888
How's ethan?

06:00.890 --> 06:02.813
He's worried
about you,

06:02.830 --> 06:04.582
But he's been good.

06:04.590 --> 06:05.421
Ok.

06:05.430 --> 06:06.829
He did his homework
without prodding

06:06.830 --> 06:10.551
And went to bed with
very little negotiating.

06:10.570 --> 06:13.699
Until he learns
how to work you.

06:17.940 --> 06:19.931
Uh...

06:19.940 --> 06:24.434
Ethan and I made you
a card last night.

06:24.450 --> 06:29.616
The, um--the bad art
is all--all me.

06:33.790 --> 06:37.852
Thank you for taking
care of ethan.

06:37.860 --> 06:41.626
It means a lot that
I can count on you.

06:46.300 --> 06:49.099
Man on tv: The mayor's office
has launched an investigation...

06:49.100 --> 06:51.330
[swishing]

06:51.340 --> 06:52.068
[spits]

06:52.070 --> 06:53.538
You're being paranoid.

06:53.540 --> 06:56.805
It would have already
been on the news by now.

06:56.810 --> 06:58.039
You don't know that.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.199
I was careful.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.473
I took
the battery out.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.572
You can't use
that phone.

07:01.580 --> 07:02.809
They'll trace us
if it's on.

07:02.820 --> 07:04.640
Yeah, thanks, you know,
because I forgot that

07:04.650 --> 07:08.780
Since the last 3 times
you told me.

07:08.790 --> 07:10.485
Where are you going?

07:10.490 --> 07:12.185
Things to do.

07:12.190 --> 07:13.624
What things, ray?

07:13.630 --> 07:15.291
Ray, I thought
we were partners.

07:15.300 --> 07:16.495
The way you come and go,

07:16.500 --> 07:17.729
I-I have no idea
what you're up to.

07:17.730 --> 07:21.792
Because you disapprove
of my actions, perry.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.029
That judgy face
of yours is

07:23.040 --> 07:24.292
Extremely annoying.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.005
You mugged an deputy
district attorney.

07:26.010 --> 07:27.205
And I got away
with it.

07:27.210 --> 07:29.770
I was careful not to
leave any evidence.

07:29.780 --> 07:30.929
So why do it?

07:30.950 --> 07:32.873
For michelle!

07:32.880 --> 07:34.871
She'll know
it was me.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.848
She won't be able
to prove it,

07:36.850 --> 07:38.079
But she
will smell it.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.239
She knows how
I operate.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.185
I don't want any innocent
people to get hurt, ray.

07:42.190 --> 07:45.160
Oh, I know. That is such
the appropriate thing to say,

07:45.160 --> 07:46.958
But we both know
that is a lie.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.850
You secretly want me
to be the bad guy.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.463
That is why you went
to seattle

07:51.470 --> 07:53.029
To spring me out
of the crazy house

07:53.040 --> 07:56.761
Because you do not have
the courage to do it yourself.

07:56.770 --> 07:57.840
That's not true.
Not true.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.308
Oh, yes it is.
It is, and it's ok.

07:59.310 --> 08:03.429
Just don't be such a
nagging little bitch about it.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.772
Just let it happen.

08:06.780 --> 08:09.670
If you want beth,

08:09.690 --> 08:12.182
We have to
break her

08:12.190 --> 08:13.885
Bit by bit.

08:13.890 --> 08:16.484
She will start
to unravel, weaken,

08:16.490 --> 08:17.616
Make poor decisions.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.883
She'll start to separate
herself from others.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.358
I do realize that
this is not exactly

08:22.360 --> 08:24.226
The nicest way to
treat someone you love,

08:24.230 --> 08:26.892
But I do believe it will all
work out in the end, ok?

08:26.900 --> 08:29.961
Come on. Hey, hey.
Chin up.

08:33.809 --> 08:35.972
Eye on the prize!

08:35.980 --> 08:38.130
Eye on the prize.

08:38.750 --> 08:42.072
[door opens and shuts]

08:42.080 --> 08:43.514
Janice: I had unis
comb the neighborhood,

08:43.520 --> 08:45.887
Thought we might get lucky
with a security camera,

08:45.890 --> 08:48.484
Ben: I've gone through
amanda's caseload,

08:48.490 --> 08:49.560
Spoke to the d.A.'s
office.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.187
They're putting together
any recent cases

08:51.190 --> 08:52.555
Where the outcome might
have caused an attack.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.585
When's the last time you
talked to perry's father?

08:54.600 --> 08:55.499
This morning,

08:55.500 --> 08:56.899
But he's no longer
being cooperative.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.664
He's worried
about the fallout.

08:58.670 --> 09:00.160
He referred to me
to his team of lawyers.

09:00.170 --> 09:01.865
What about the p.I. That
he hired to find perry?

09:01.870 --> 09:03.190
He won't say.
He could be local

09:03.210 --> 09:06.168
Or someone up
in santa barbara.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.132
She had
a rough night.

09:09.140 --> 09:10.278
I'm a little
worried.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.749
She's getting
intense.

09:16.380 --> 09:19.748
Jack: We just don't have any
proof that ray attacked amanda.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.081
There were two cases of
vandalism on the same night

09:22.090 --> 09:23.751
On the same block
amanda was attacked.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.025
I'm not saying I don't believe
you, but explain it to me.

09:27.030 --> 09:28.657
Why would ray go
after amanda?

09:28.660 --> 09:30.492
Because this is
what he does.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.865
This is his game.

09:31.870 --> 09:34.328
These just
arrived for you.

09:35.970 --> 09:37.062
Who delivered those?

09:37.070 --> 09:38.629
Guy from
the flower shop.

09:38.640 --> 09:39.937
He just left.

09:39.940 --> 09:41.135
Ooh! There!

09:41.140 --> 09:42.904
Stop him!

09:45.250 --> 09:47.002
Hey!

09:48.980 --> 09:51.745
Deliveryman: Yes.
He had shorter hair,

09:51.750 --> 09:53.013
But that's the guy.

09:53.020 --> 09:54.784
He came in
and paid cash.

09:54.790 --> 09:56.679
Was he alone?
Did he have a car?

09:56.690 --> 09:57.680
He was alone.

09:57.690 --> 09:59.920
I-I-I didn't see
a car,

09:59.930 --> 10:01.523
But it doesn't mean
anything.

10:01.530 --> 10:02.998
You can't see
the parking lot

10:03.000 --> 10:04.092
From our store window.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.467
"Soon." did he write
this card himself?

10:06.470 --> 10:08.120
Yeah. I saw him.

10:08.140 --> 10:10.165
Left-handed.
I remember that.

10:10.170 --> 10:11.706

on vermont.

10:11.710 --> 10:12.962
Let's look
for hotels nearby.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.368
We could get lucky
with a video trail.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.474
I'll pull all the camera
footage in the area.

10:16.480 --> 10:20.110
Thank you, sir. Ben
will escort you out.

10:22.820 --> 10:24.345
Ray's mom, she had
a flower garden.

10:24.350 --> 10:27.718
He would bring me
lilies from it, only lilies.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.915
That's his handwriting.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.149
Ok. So you know
this guy,

10:30.160 --> 10:32.151
And this is
his game.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.686
What's his
next move?

10:37.730 --> 10:40.324
Man: Is an offer coming
or not?

10:40.340 --> 10:41.899
Tell your client
he has till 5:00,

10:41.900 --> 10:43.664
Or we're accepting
the other offer.

10:43.670 --> 10:45.468
No contingencies.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.302
Let me know.

just responded to call.

11:52.770 --> 11:55.137
Neighbors found _carl
stevens in his kitchen,

11:55.140 --> 11:57.029
Head wounds from
a home invasion.

11:57.050 --> 12:01.169
Wait. Did I miss something?
Who's carl stevens?

12:03.120 --> 12:04.349
Tracy, where are you?

12:04.350 --> 12:06.785
Ray:
Hello, michelle.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.550
Where's tracy?

12:11.560 --> 12:12.584
[tracy struggling]

12:12.590 --> 12:13.682
Tracy, are you ok?

12:13.700 --> 12:15.691
Yeah, I'm ok.
Beth, I'm with ray.

12:15.700 --> 12:16.451
He--aah!

12:16.470 --> 12:18.495
This really is
getting exciting.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.592
I-I forgot what
it is like

12:19.600 --> 12:23.036
To have you
in my life.

12:23.040 --> 12:26.169
I'll see you soon,
michelle.

12:26.170 --> 12:28.002
[disconnects]

12:34.650 --> 12:36.709
We're live outside
this pasadena home,

12:36.720 --> 12:38.313
Where earlier today
a 35-year-old woman...

12:38.320 --> 12:39.845
S.1.D. Is monitoring
tracy's cell.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.112
It's likely destroyed
or turned off.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.009
Maybe they'll get lucky.
I doubt it.

12:43.020 --> 12:44.419
Any word
on carl stevens?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.579
He's still in surgery.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.058
How did ray know where
tracy was staying?

12:47.060 --> 12:48.653
Tracy left town
when perry went messing.

12:48.660 --> 12:50.754
She came back a week ago,
and she was staying with carl,

12:50.770 --> 12:52.659
But ray
doesn't know carl.

12:52.670 --> 12:54.195
Robbery homicide
spoke to the manager

12:54.200 --> 12:55.133
At tracy's restaurant,

12:55.140 --> 12:56.164
Showed her pictures
of ray.

12:56.170 --> 12:57.490
She recognized him,
said he came in

12:57.510 --> 12:59.035
In the past few days,
sat the bar, ate lunch.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.508
And he listened
to them talk.

13:00.510 --> 13:01.807
Yeah. There was
a conversation

13:01.810 --> 13:03.801
About payroll checks being
sent to tracy for signature.

13:03.810 --> 13:04.902
How could they be
so careless?

13:04.910 --> 13:06.605
Time passed. They
let their guard down.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.849
Ben: Take a look
at this.

13:07.850 --> 13:11.809
Here's the security footage
from the flower shop.

13:11.820 --> 13:12.890
That's ray.

13:12.890 --> 13:14.187
I was able to track
his movements,

13:14.190 --> 13:16.955
Using traffic
cameras in the area.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.925
Jack: You got
a partial plate.

13:18.930 --> 13:20.386
I'll run all
possible combos,

13:20.400 --> 13:23.097
So if the flower shop
is located here,

13:23.100 --> 13:24.522
He walked one block south,

13:24.530 --> 13:25.668
And then he drove north.

13:25.670 --> 13:29.265
Let's pull all the traffic
cameras from alvarez avenue.

13:29.270 --> 13:31.659
[thump]

13:31.670 --> 13:33.502
[thump]

13:39.180 --> 13:41.171
[thump thump thump]

13:49.790 --> 13:50.860
You're awake.

13:50.860 --> 13:53.329
Chloroform headaches
are the worst.

13:53.330 --> 13:54.525
All right. If I take
the tape off,

13:54.530 --> 13:56.225
Promise you're not
gonna scream.

13:56.230 --> 13:59.825
If you scream,
I'm not gonna be nice.

14:03.470 --> 14:05.234
All right.

14:05.240 --> 14:08.107
[panting]

14:09.740 --> 14:12.141
Want some water?
Yes.

14:13.050 --> 14:16.441
Got you.
There we go.

14:16.450 --> 14:17.872
It's good?

14:17.890 --> 14:19.881
Yeah.

14:20.450 --> 14:23.954
Do you want to use the...Little
girls' room or anything?

14:23.960 --> 14:26.725
What do you want
from me?

14:26.730 --> 14:28.892
Um...

14:28.900 --> 14:31.050
Perry tells me

14:31.070 --> 14:33.562
You know all about
michelle's old life,

14:33.570 --> 14:35.561
So I think my objective
is obvious.

14:35.570 --> 14:39.700
I want to know what you,
you know, know about me.

14:39.710 --> 14:42.236
I know
the general story,

14:42.240 --> 14:46.199
How her family died,
the fire,

14:46.210 --> 14:49.748
But she's also told me
about your other side,

14:49.750 --> 14:50.740
The good times.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.548
She's told me how kind
you can be,

14:52.550 --> 14:55.485
How gentle and sweet.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.251
Nice try.

15:00.260 --> 15:03.127
How gentle and sweet
I am with you

15:03.130 --> 15:05.326
Depends on michelle.

15:06.730 --> 15:07.663
We got to go.

15:07.670 --> 15:09.559
No, no. Please don't
leave me in here.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.561
Please. I won't
make trouble.

15:11.570 --> 15:14.335
Please, please.

15:15.210 --> 15:18.999
I won't scream.
I won't scream.

15:19.010 --> 15:20.148
I'm sorry.

15:20.150 --> 15:23.745
I won't scream.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.640
Just breathe.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.269
Got a hit on that
partial plate.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.270
Who's it
registered to?

15:48.280 --> 15:51.136
- Juanita farrell.
Lives in carpinteria.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.640
That's near
santa barbara.

15:52.650 --> 15:54.402
I'll put out a bolo.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.275
What the hell?

16:01.420 --> 16:03.809
What's with the crazy
suit people?

16:03.830 --> 16:05.355
No idea.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.351
Something big.

16:08.660 --> 16:12.267
Beth, what's going on?

16:12.270 --> 16:14.728
They're here
to see me.

16:21.180 --> 16:24.172
Lieutenant, please
take a seat.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.841
I know we have a lot
to go over.

16:25.850 --> 16:28.740
[indistinct chatter]

16:43.400 --> 16:45.926
Woman on tv: Sources tell us
miss wright was staying

16:45.930 --> 16:47.762
With stevens
after a restraining order

16:47.770 --> 16:51.035
Was issued against local
college student perry whitley.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.166
[knock on door]

16:52.170 --> 16:53.035
The lapd is now engaged

16:53.040 --> 16:54.439
In a statewide manhunt
for whitley

16:54.440 --> 16:56.477
And another suspect--
ray matthews.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.504
Who is it?

16:57.510 --> 17:01.299
Either of these two men
should call--

17:10.130 --> 17:14.419
What do you think I'm doing
here? Your father sent me.

17:14.430 --> 17:15.989
You alone?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.819
Yeah.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.390
Well, you really did it
this time, didn't you?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.128
Come all this way
to tell me that?

17:22.140 --> 17:26.566
No. I came all this way
to save your ass.

17:29.510 --> 17:30.773
You have something
to do with this?

17:30.780 --> 17:33.306
It wasn't me.
I swear.

17:33.310 --> 17:37.019
Yeah? Was it
your new friend, huh?

17:37.020 --> 17:38.419
Cops know you're
traveling together,

17:38.420 --> 17:39.740
So now you're
an accessory

17:39.750 --> 17:40.581
To kidnapping, perry.

17:40.590 --> 17:42.513
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.286
No? Well, how was it
supposed to go?

17:46.290 --> 17:50.056
I've, uh, misjudged
the situation a bit,

17:50.070 --> 17:54.064
Put trust in someone
that's proven untrustworthy.

17:54.070 --> 17:57.961
And what if he kills
her, huh? What then?

17:57.970 --> 18:01.008
I never meant to hurt
anyone, gene.

18:01.010 --> 18:03.433
You never do, perry.

18:05.610 --> 18:08.272
How did you find me?

18:08.280 --> 18:09.748
You know that
household account

18:09.750 --> 18:11.969
That you think nobody
knows you have access to?

18:11.990 --> 18:16.655
You used the atm at the
store around the corner.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.116
I ran out of money.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.757
Yeah? Well, that's
understandable.

18:19.760 --> 18:20.659
Look at this.

18:20.660 --> 18:23.027
You're living
the high life here, huh?

18:23.030 --> 18:27.228
It's ok, perry. I'm here to
help you like I always do.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.368
We'll call your father,

18:29.370 --> 18:30.462
Let him know
you're safe,

18:30.470 --> 18:34.202
See how he wants to
handle this thing.

18:35.010 --> 18:37.570
Ben: The one who
doesn't smile is the captain.

18:37.580 --> 18:38.729
And the woman
in the bad skirt

18:38.750 --> 18:40.172
Is patty
from personnel.

18:40.180 --> 18:43.218
I don't recognize
the others.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.426
Janice: What the hell?
What's going on?

18:58.430 --> 19:01.661
I'm being relieved
of my command.

19:01.670 --> 19:03.764
The captain thinks
I should take a backseat

19:03.770 --> 19:06.410
Until this whole
ray thing is settled.

19:06.410 --> 19:08.538
- I'm involved
in the case now,

19:08.540 --> 19:09.507
So I'm too close.

19:09.510 --> 19:11.069
- So who's
in charge now?

19:11.080 --> 19:12.673
Vicky gregg.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.478
Who's vicky gregg?

19:14.480 --> 19:16.812
That would be me.

19:28.130 --> 19:29.052
What's her story?

19:29.060 --> 19:30.357
She got
her start here

19:30.370 --> 19:31.394
And left to work jric.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.595
And after that,
the fbi.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.761
She's
a federal agent?

19:33.770 --> 19:34.919
And a best-selling author.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.499
She's written several
books on stalking.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.832
She mostly consults
until now.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.604
Anything she
doesn't do?

19:40.610 --> 19:42.032
All I know is

19:42.040 --> 19:43.439
She's good.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.908
Beth, it's great
to see you again

19:44.910 --> 19:47.948
Despite the circumstances.

19:47.950 --> 19:49.349
You, too.

19:49.350 --> 19:50.476
And please use
my office.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.481
No. Beth, I'm not here
to replace you.

19:52.490 --> 19:53.810
I'm just here to help.

19:53.820 --> 19:55.379
I'll work out
of the conference room

19:55.390 --> 19:58.849
Until this is
all resolved.

19:58.860 --> 20:00.680
Thanks.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.393
You know this guy.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.199
Is he going to
kill her?

20:12.810 --> 20:17.805
I believe that is
his intention, yes.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.510
Well, then I better
get to it.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.214
Do you want to go home,
take a little rest?

20:25.220 --> 20:27.314
I can set up
a security detail for you.

20:27.320 --> 20:28.390
No, no.

20:28.390 --> 20:30.916
No. I prefer
to stay.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.728
Of course.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.861
So tracy has been missing
for over 3 hours now.

20:39.870 --> 20:42.635
Where are we
on the video trail?

20:42.640 --> 20:44.062
Uh, yes. Ben.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.402
Caldwell from riverside,
detective level one,

20:46.410 --> 20:48.504
Been with tau
for over two years.

20:48.510 --> 20:49.671
Very nice to meet you.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.079
The trail stops
at 3rd and alvarez.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.344
We're combing the streets
with all available units.

20:53.350 --> 20:54.806
We have traces on
amanda taylor's phone,

20:54.820 --> 20:56.219
As well as
tracy wright,

20:56.220 --> 20:58.018
But he could easily
be out of |.A. By now.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.647
No, he's not left
the city.

20:59.650 --> 21:00.913
Janice: Why do you
think that?

21:00.920 --> 21:02.354
I-I'm janice.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.759
Lawrence. I've heard
great things about you.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.387
Because he's after michelle.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.484
He wouldn't come all
the way down from seattle

21:07.500 --> 21:09.059
To just grab
the friend and go.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.700
Jack: He's bipolar,
disconnected from reality.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.429
Jack larsen.

21:13.430 --> 21:14.591
Yes. Transfer
from nypd homicide.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.762
Yeah, and I make
a bad first impression,

21:16.770 --> 21:17.965
Just to warn you.

21:17.970 --> 21:19.267
I can vouch
for that.

21:19.270 --> 21:22.274
Listen. I know you all
care very deeply about beth.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.839
This is a family unit.
I can feel it.

21:23.850 --> 21:27.104
It's strong. We're gonna
use that to nail this guy.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.942
Ray matthews suffers
from personality disorder,

21:29.950 --> 21:31.076
Reality distortion,

21:31.090 --> 21:35.414
And the big elephant that
no one wants to say out loud--

21:35.420 --> 21:36.888
He is a psychopathic killer.

21:36.890 --> 21:38.415
How do we know that?
The only people he's killed

21:38.430 --> 21:41.559
Is beth's family, which can
be argued was accidental.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.393
He served 12 years
of an 8-year sentence,

21:44.400 --> 21:46.596
And it was his family
that kept him locked up.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.365
Janice: Because they know
him better than anyone else.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.589
His childhood is riddled
with outbreaks

21:51.610 --> 21:52.702
Suggesting
psychopathic behavior.

21:52.710 --> 21:54.667
What's his plan?
What's he gonna do

21:54.680 --> 21:57.502
With tracy,
kill her?

21:57.510 --> 21:58.830
Possibly,

21:58.850 --> 22:01.740
But the one he really
wants to kill is beth.

22:01.750 --> 22:04.947
He wants michelle back,
the woman that he has loved

22:04.950 --> 22:06.111
Since childhood,

22:06.120 --> 22:07.349
And she no longer exists.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.988
Beth does. Beth has
created a whole new life,

22:09.990 --> 22:10.912
So if he

22:10.930 --> 22:12.056
If he can
destroy that,

22:12.060 --> 22:13.323
He can have
michelle back.

22:13.330 --> 22:14.627
How does perry whitley
fit into all this?

22:14.630 --> 22:17.053
I suspect that he is
in way over his head.

22:17.070 --> 22:21.291
His obsession is not on
ray's level, nowhere near it.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.790
Has perry's father given
us the name

22:22.800 --> 22:24.029
Of the investigatory yet?

22:24.040 --> 22:24.939
Completely stonewalled.

22:24.940 --> 22:26.260
Well, let's get
his call logs,

22:26.270 --> 22:27.908
And if someone calls
from los angeles, then--

22:27.910 --> 22:29.309
I can't get
the d.A.'s office

22:29.310 --> 22:32.371
To support a warrant to get
the father's phone records.

22:32.380 --> 22:34.178
All right. Well, you all
have your work to do.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.569
Just keep me posted.

22:41.490 --> 22:45.358
George. Hey. Hi.
It's vicky gregg.

22:45.360 --> 22:48.159
Yeah. Listen
I need a favor, hon.

22:48.160 --> 22:52.563
Can you connect me
with john pierce from the nsa?

22:53.530 --> 22:54.668
Hey.

22:54.670 --> 22:55.762
He'll have
switched cars.

22:55.770 --> 22:56.840
He knows we're
on to him,

22:56.840 --> 22:59.434
So look for any reported
stolen vehicles.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.862
We can triangulate
the area.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.770
If you close in on ray,
he'll slip up.

23:03.780 --> 23:05.771
How are you?

23:08.920 --> 23:12.242
It will all be out soon--

23:12.250 --> 23:14.309
My past, my old life.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.652
That's what he wants,
you know?

23:16.660 --> 23:18.685
He wants michelle back.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.089
He won't get her.

23:20.090 --> 23:21.956
I won't let him.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.792
Jack, please be careful.

23:23.800 --> 23:24.858
He's targeting my life.

23:24.870 --> 23:27.464
That means you,
it means janice and ben.

23:27.470 --> 23:30.030
We're gonna
find him.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.792
Vicky: Hey, john.
It's vicky.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.403
Listen. I wouldn't bug you,

23:33.410 --> 23:36.072
But I have a girl
out here in |.A.

23:36.080 --> 23:40.244
Who is 5 minutes from dead
if you can't help me.

23:40.250 --> 23:43.174
Yes, the one
from the news.

23:44.750 --> 23:49.688
No. It's not a matter
of national security.

23:49.690 --> 23:50.680
It's a simple favor,

23:50.690 --> 23:53.125
And it's something
you do all the time,

23:53.130 --> 23:56.225
And you know I know it.

23:56.230 --> 23:58.995
Calm down, john.
That was not a veiled threat.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.459
It was right out there
in the open.

24:02.470 --> 24:05.030
All right. The
private investigator

24:05.040 --> 24:06.735
We're looking for
is gene meadows.

24:06.740 --> 24:07.935
He's a full-time
employee

24:07.940 --> 24:08.862
Of the whitley
corp.,

24:08.880 --> 24:10.439
Perry's family's
company.

24:10.450 --> 24:11.474
How did you--

24:11.480 --> 24:12.641
Ben, ping his phone,
get us a location,

24:12.650 --> 24:14.744
Contact robbery homicide
and swat.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.946
Jack, let's go.

24:22.860 --> 24:25.181
Gene: So is this ray
a violent guy,

24:25.190 --> 24:26.919
Or is he messed up
in the head,

24:26.930 --> 24:29.649
Kind of like...

24:29.660 --> 24:31.799
Like me?

24:31.800 --> 24:33.859
No. I meant--

24:33.870 --> 24:35.895
Nah. That's
what I meant. Heh.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.267
I didn't think so,
but yeah.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.102
Yeah, he's different.

24:40.110 --> 24:42.260
He can violent.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.930
When's my dad
gonna call?

24:43.950 --> 24:45.839
Your dad's a busy man.

24:45.850 --> 24:48.979
But it's just
ray could come back.

24:48.980 --> 24:51.620
[cell phone ringing]

24:51.620 --> 24:54.840
Hello, sir.

24:54.860 --> 24:57.181
Yes, he's fine.

24:57.190 --> 24:58.919
We can do that.

24:58.930 --> 25:01.456
Yes. I think
you're right.

25:01.460 --> 25:05.249
I'll call you, uh,
from the car.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.227
All right.
He wants you home.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.696
Let's go.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.964
That's not gonna
fix anything.

25:10.970 --> 25:12.631
You're gonna turn
yourself in

25:12.640 --> 25:15.564
But in santa barbara
with lawyers present.

25:15.580 --> 25:17.639
It's all about
the narrative, perry.

25:17.650 --> 25:18.833
You got to distance
yourself from ray

25:18.850 --> 25:20.739
And from this entire
mess in |.A.

25:20.750 --> 25:22.878
He's a psychotic
criminal.

25:22.880 --> 25:23.779
You're a troubled kid.

25:23.780 --> 25:25.885
We'll fix it.
Get your stuff,

25:25.890 --> 25:27.517
Put it in the bag.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.181
[door opens]

25:32.830 --> 25:34.559
What's going
on here?

25:34.560 --> 25:38.827
This is, um,
a friend of my dad's.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.993
So daddy finally
came calling?

25:44.840 --> 25:46.934
Hi.

25:46.940 --> 25:48.135
I'm ray.

25:48.140 --> 25:50.529
Know who you are.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.217
Ray, stop!

25:57.220 --> 26:00.713
Ray, please stop!

26:00.720 --> 26:02.757
[moans]

26:08.560 --> 26:13.168
Think very carefully
about you next move.

26:13.170 --> 26:16.561
It is going to
define a lot.

26:16.570 --> 26:18.595
He just showed up.

26:18.610 --> 26:21.238
I had no idea.
I'm sorry.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.675
I'm trying really
hard to give you

26:23.680 --> 26:26.650
The benefit
of the doubt.

26:26.650 --> 26:29.642
Please. You can
trust me.

26:36.120 --> 26:39.215
Right. Ok.

26:43.130 --> 26:46.361
[perry groaning]

26:54.210 --> 26:57.009
[police radio chatter]

27:04.820 --> 27:06.879
Ready? Let's go.

27:06.890 --> 27:08.449
Stand by.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.110
[gunshot]

27:10.120 --> 27:11.053
Move, move!

27:11.060 --> 27:14.985
Secure the premises.
We'll take right.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.991
All clear!

27:17.000 --> 27:19.697
Got something,
commander.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.568
In here, agent.

27:33.580 --> 27:35.799
Gene meadows.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.845
And he had a daughter.

27:37.850 --> 27:40.285
That just pisses me off.

27:40.290 --> 27:41.780
Contact the family,
move fast.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.589
We won't be able
to control the press.

27:45.730 --> 27:49.030
So the room is registered
to an alias--rick jones.

27:49.030 --> 27:51.021
But it's clearly
perry and ray.

27:51.030 --> 27:52.225
So the p.I.
Finds perry,

27:52.230 --> 27:53.720
But ray takes
him out.

27:53.730 --> 27:56.336
And now they're on the move
with a hostage.

27:56.340 --> 27:57.466
Unless he killed tracy.

27:57.470 --> 27:58.835
She's his only
bargaining chip.

27:58.840 --> 28:02.561
I think that should keep
her alive for a while.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.973
[breathing heavily]

28:48.050 --> 28:50.690
Got a little gift
for you.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.008
Tracy.

29:08.010 --> 29:11.036
Go ahead.
Get her out.

29:14.180 --> 29:16.342
Go ahead.
Say hello.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.998
I'm sorry.

29:37.970 --> 29:41.338
I know this is
all my fault.

29:41.340 --> 29:42.410
I screwed up.

29:42.410 --> 29:44.970
That's an understatement.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.978
What are you gonna
do to her?

29:48.980 --> 29:52.245
She's gonna bring
me michelle.

29:52.250 --> 29:55.379
But you're not
gonna hurt her?

29:55.390 --> 29:58.280
That depends.

29:58.290 --> 30:00.429
This has gone
too far, ray.

30:00.430 --> 30:03.695
Heh. That's fair.

30:10.740 --> 30:12.196
Guys!

30:12.210 --> 30:14.861
Start a trace.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.473
Ready.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.630
Hello?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.470
Hello, michelle.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.073
Where is tracy?
Is she ok?

30:22.080 --> 30:23.969
Let me speak
to her.

30:23.980 --> 30:26.984
Do you remember
our first date?

30:28.020 --> 30:30.717
The beach on the
olympic peninsula.

30:30.720 --> 30:34.088
I wanted to impress you
with this long drive,

30:34.090 --> 30:36.127
And instead,
I got us lost.

30:36.130 --> 30:37.495
That wasn't
your fault.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.993
Yeah, but I did stop
to ask for directions.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.037
But the guy sent us
the wrong way.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.839
Yeah, that's right.
You remember.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.059
You--you--you took
pity on me,

30:48.080 --> 30:52.233
And I am glad
for it.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.877
Ray, where's tracy?

30:53.880 --> 30:55.405
Ben: Call's coming
from an unlisted number.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.115
He's on a burner phone.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.576
Still triangulating.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.843
Ray: The wind was blowing,
and we just--

31:00.860 --> 31:03.010
We rolled down the windows
even though it was cold.

31:03.020 --> 31:06.058
We didn't even care because
the music was blasting

31:06.060 --> 31:07.425
On the stereo.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.182
You remember that?

31:09.200 --> 31:10.326
Yes, I do.

31:10.330 --> 31:14.369
What--what song
was playing?

31:14.370 --> 31:16.259
Annie lennox.

31:16.270 --> 31:17.635
That's right.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.039
That's right.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.668
Do you still
listen to her.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.000
It's hard, ray.

31:23.010 --> 31:25.229
Her music reminds
me of you,

31:25.250 --> 31:27.742
And, um,
it hurts me.

31:27.750 --> 31:30.014
I don't want that.

31:30.020 --> 31:34.184
Then tell me that
tracy's ok.

31:34.190 --> 31:36.613
She's ok for now,

31:36.620 --> 31:38.782
But hurry, michelle.

31:38.790 --> 31:43.751
She's counting on you
to find her.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.069
Ben: He's in the valley,
somewhere within two miles

31:49.070 --> 31:53.200
Beth: He was, um,
talking about our first date.

31:53.210 --> 31:55.269
We took a road trip
down to the beach.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.770
Jack: What's the name
of the beach?

31:56.780 --> 31:59.943
Maybe this is part
of the game.

31:59.950 --> 32:01.975
Wait.

32:01.980 --> 32:04.369
He asked
for directions.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.415
Maybe this is
a message.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.809
We--we stopped to
ask for directions--

32:08.820 --> 32:11.209
We got lost--
at a junkyard.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.358
Janice, ben, look for
a junkyard in that area.

32:13.360 --> 32:14.828
Why wouldn't he just
tell you?

32:14.830 --> 32:16.298
Ben, it's a game.
Just do it!

32:16.300 --> 32:17.153
Beth, calm down.

32:17.160 --> 32:18.889
Don't tell me
to calm down, jack!

32:18.900 --> 32:20.459
We need to
find her now!

32:20.470 --> 32:21.722
Vicky: OK.
All right, beth.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.890
Listen. We are going
to find tracy,

32:23.900 --> 32:25.334
But right in this
very moment,

32:25.340 --> 32:26.830
We're going to
escort you home.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.899
Ben, I want you to
escort beth home.

32:28.910 --> 32:31.538
I want you to take
a unit with you.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.844
Found one junkyard
in the area.

32:36.850 --> 32:38.375
All right. Send me
everything on it.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.744
Jack, take janice
with you.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.685
You check it out, keep
in constant contact.

32:42.690 --> 32:45.489
Ben, make sure she's ok.

32:46.760 --> 32:48.956
Ray: All right.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.519
Let's get on
with it.

32:50.530 --> 32:52.851
What are you
gonna do?

32:53.730 --> 32:55.892
Leave her alone.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.436
Come here.

32:57.440 --> 32:58.794
Run, run!

32:58.810 --> 33:00.562
Oof!

33:00.570 --> 33:02.334
Unh!

33:04.510 --> 33:07.377
[coughing]

33:08.650 --> 33:11.517
[panting]

33:19.490 --> 33:21.322
Ray: Tracy!

33:22.600 --> 33:24.557
Tracy!

33:25.970 --> 33:27.859
Aah!

33:52.030 --> 33:54.488
Let's not do this, tracy!

33:54.500 --> 33:58.221
It's really bad timing.
Ha ha!

33:58.800 --> 34:00.564
Ooh.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.532
[gasps]

34:07.310 --> 34:10.199
[screaming]

34:14.949 --> 34:17.418
[crying]

34:17.420 --> 34:19.547
I guess it's time.

34:19.550 --> 34:21.541
Aah!

34:21.560 --> 34:23.619
[grunting]

34:26.489 --> 34:28.254
Ohh!

34:30.600 --> 34:33.092
Aah!

34:43.440 --> 34:46.170
We're almost done.

34:46.179 --> 34:49.070
Just one more game.

34:57.590 --> 34:59.786
Let me know if you
guys need anything.

34:59.790 --> 35:02.225
Man on tv: ...Still searching
for kidnapping victim

35:02.230 --> 35:04.449
Tracy wright, who was taken
from a pasadena home

35:04.470 --> 35:06.325
Earlier today.

35:06.330 --> 35:07.866
Sources tell us that
a raid tonight

35:07.870 --> 35:09.224
On an east hollywood motel...

35:09.240 --> 35:12.938
What do you say we
turn that off for 5 minutes?

35:12.940 --> 35:16.205
I'm good, ben.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.872
What about food?
You hungry?

35:18.880 --> 35:21.099
...Information
on the two suspects

35:21.120 --> 35:24.579
Should contact the lapd.

35:29.990 --> 35:31.116

35:31.130 --> 35:32.689
Man: Both sides.

35:32.690 --> 35:34.829
Body cams are on
and in place.

35:34.830 --> 35:36.650
I want that yard
locked down.

35:36.660 --> 35:38.321
Search everything,
and remember,

35:38.330 --> 35:40.162
We're searching
for a hostage,

35:40.170 --> 35:41.820
So keep those
safeties on.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.195
Janice: Think there's
a map or a blueprint

35:44.200 --> 35:45.531
Of this place somewhere?

35:45.540 --> 35:46.564
Jack: It is
what it is.

35:46.570 --> 35:49.107
"She's counting
on you to find her."

35:49.110 --> 35:51.101
Those were his words.

35:51.110 --> 35:52.930
[sighs]

[cell phone ringing]

35:55.250 --> 35:56.172
It's jack!

35:56.180 --> 35:58.148
Jack, what's
happening?

35:58.150 --> 35:59.015
This place is big.

35:59.020 --> 36:01.011
No sign of ray
or perry.

36:01.020 --> 36:04.809
You think he would have
left us here for us to find?

36:04.830 --> 36:06.150
Why would he?

36:06.160 --> 36:08.083
Where would she be, beth?

36:08.100 --> 36:09.420
What did he say?

36:09.430 --> 36:11.228
Well, besides
the first date,

36:11.230 --> 36:12.129
Driving the coast,

36:12.130 --> 36:13.723
We talked about
listening to

36:13.730 --> 36:14.959
Annie lennox
in the car.

36:14.970 --> 36:16.222
Beth, what kind of car
was it?

36:16.240 --> 36:17.389
On the date?
Yeah.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.596
On that date,
what he was driving you in?

36:19.610 --> 36:21.601
It was, um,
an old chevelle.

36:21.610 --> 36:24.033
It was a vintage car
that he souped up.

36:24.040 --> 36:27.340
Look for an old chevelle!

36:27.350 --> 36:29.148
Just hang on.

36:50.170 --> 36:51.968
There!

37:08.450 --> 37:10.851
What's her status?

37:10.860 --> 37:13.079
Beth, we found tracy.

37:13.090 --> 37:14.023
Is she alive?

37:14.030 --> 37:15.088
She's still breathing.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.625
Jack: Yeah, she's alive.

37:16.630 --> 37:17.529
Thank god.

37:17.530 --> 37:18.793
Look. I got to go.

37:18.800 --> 37:19.858
Jack, is she ok?

37:19.870 --> 37:23.124
Yeah, she's ok.
I'll call you later.

37:26.970 --> 37:29.940
Tracy, tracy, tracy.

37:29.940 --> 37:34.047
It's jack.
You're safe.

37:34.050 --> 37:34.903
Where's beth?

37:34.920 --> 37:36.843
She's home.
She's safe, too.

37:36.850 --> 37:38.011
No. No. I heard him.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.510
He wanted you
to find me.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.784
He wanted you here.

37:41.790 --> 37:42.939
That was his plan.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.850
This was always
a distraction.

37:46.490 --> 37:47.889
I'm gonna change.

37:47.890 --> 37:49.722
Sure thing.

37:57.870 --> 38:00.635
[cell phone ringing]

38:04.380 --> 38:05.632
It's ben. What's up?

38:05.650 --> 38:07.470
Jack: You guys ok?
We couldn't find ray.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.005
I think he might try
to go after beth.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.239
We're good here.
I'm with her,

38:11.250 --> 38:13.844
And there's
a uniform outside.

38:18.120 --> 38:21.750
Hey. Be on high alert,
will you?

38:30.940 --> 38:33.068
Get units to beth davis'
house now! Now!

38:33.070 --> 38:35.960
Janice: We need units and
an ambulance to 25 alta vista.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.677
[ben wheezing]

38:40.180 --> 38:41.306
Ben?

38:41.320 --> 38:44.620
Ben? No! No! Ben.

38:44.620 --> 38:46.418
[sputtering]

38:46.420 --> 38:49.082
Ben, no.

[gagging]

39:06.410 --> 39:08.003
Ray: Phew.

39:08.010 --> 39:10.672
That's got to hurt.

39:10.680 --> 39:15.379
You want me to...
Help you out?

39:15.380 --> 39:17.144
I...

[sirens,
radio chatter]

39:34.500 --> 39:35.524
Ben?!

39:35.540 --> 39:37.030
How is he?

39:37.040 --> 39:39.634
We're trying to
get a pulse.

39:42.210 --> 39:43.837
Beth!

39:46.250 --> 39:48.446
Beth!

39:48.450 --> 39:51.875
Beth!

39:51.890 --> 39:54.609
Beth!

39:54.620 --> 39:55.485
