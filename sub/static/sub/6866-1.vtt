WEBVTT

00:01.686 --> 00:04.280
Sterling Archer.

00:04.455 --> 00:07.856
Code name Duchess.

00:08.526 --> 00:09.550
Hm.

00:09.727 --> 00:16.360
Known from Berlin to Bangkok
as the world's most dangerous spy.

00:16.534 --> 00:19.025
So for us, this is... How you say?

00:20.337 --> 00:22.271
A good get.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.000
But not so good for you, Mr. Archer.

00:25.176 --> 00:28.407
Because you have information
that I want.

00:28.579 --> 00:30.513
And this may be old clichÃ©...

00:32.850 --> 00:36.377
but we have ways of making you talk.

00:37.388 --> 00:38.980
What? Your little go-cart battery?

00:39.156 --> 00:40.384
- Golf cart.
- Whatever.

00:40.558 --> 00:43.254
- Would you pick an accent and stick with it?
- Listen here...

00:43.427 --> 00:46.658
Son of a bitch.
- Now you did it.

00:51.368 --> 00:54.826
- What is the point of these simulations...
- Krenshaw's arousal?

00:55.005 --> 00:57.337
If you don't take them seriously?

00:57.508 --> 01:00.443
How can I? Between his lame accent
and the go-cart battery...

01:00.611 --> 01:01.839
- Golf cart.
- Shut up.

01:02.012 --> 01:03.707
And speaking of lame, my code name...

01:03.881 --> 01:06.873
Was chosen at random
by the ISIS computer.

01:07.051 --> 01:08.916
Random? It was your dog's name.

01:09.086 --> 01:10.644
Oh, Duchess.

01:12.089 --> 01:14.148
I loved her so much.

01:14.325 --> 01:15.815
That it was creepy and pathetic?

01:15.993 --> 01:18.427
And if you were half as smart
as she was...

01:18.596 --> 01:21.360
She wasn't too smart to die
from eating chocolate, was she?

01:21.532 --> 01:22.760
Exercise terminated.

01:22.933 --> 01:26.198
- All right, that's lunch then.
- Agent performance unsatisfactory.

01:26.370 --> 01:28.804
Oh, come on...
At worst, that was "needs improvement."

01:28.973 --> 01:30.031
- Jesus, Archer.
- What?

01:30.207 --> 01:33.199
- You think this is a game?
- No, I think Jenga is a game.

01:33.377 --> 01:34.901
What if I'd been real KGB?

01:35.079 --> 01:38.207
I assume you'd try to suck a promotion
out of some Russian guy's cock.

01:38.382 --> 01:40.350
- Maybe I never get promoted...
- Never will.

01:40.518 --> 01:42.349
Because my mommy's not the boss.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.045
And maybe you just got your face
kicked off.

01:45.222 --> 01:48.191
That is my foot in your face.
Smell the embarrass...

01:48.359 --> 01:50.156
Ow, oh!

01:50.961 --> 01:52.394
Mother, did you see that?

01:53.531 --> 01:55.192
Mother.

01:55.733 --> 01:57.291
Mother.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074

<i>Leave a message at the tone.</i>

02:43.247 --> 02:45.306
<i>Um... Tone.</i>

02:45.482 --> 02:49.145
<i>This is Four-Five-Six Laundry.
Your shirts are ready... for a week.</i>

02:49.320 --> 02:51.288
Oh, no.

02:51.455 --> 02:52.820
- Good morning.
- Hey, you.

02:52.990 --> 02:54.514
I'm so hungry.

02:54.692 --> 02:57.923
Just give me five minutes on my backhand
then we'll see if there's a...

02:58.095 --> 03:02.259
<i>- Is that a dog? Is it a dog?
- Oui, that is Abelard.</i>

03:02.433 --> 03:04.196
Oh, adorable.
Now get the hell out of here.

03:04.368 --> 03:06.495
But you promised me breakfast.

03:06.670 --> 03:09.696
You want breakfast?
Try the diner. You're obviously into Greek.

03:11.208 --> 03:12.470
Get it?

03:13.844 --> 03:14.868
Thank you, Abelard.

03:15.045 --> 03:16.842
- It's a short list, Woodhouse.
Yes, sir.

03:17.014 --> 03:20.108
- Things we don't allow in. What are they?
- Dogs and your mother.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.650
- That's a very short list, isn't it?
- Yes...

03:22.820 --> 03:25.015
but you were quite insistent...
- What was I?

03:25.189 --> 03:27.020
That an exception be made.

03:27.191 --> 03:32.219
No, no, no, because forget the dog rule,
because this pug is amazing.

03:32.396 --> 03:34.023
Watch this. Abergard, go.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.198
Do you not hear that?

03:37.701 --> 03:39.692
That's "Puttin' on the Ritz," man.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.861
- I'm always insistent, Woodhouse.
- Yes, sir.

03:42.039 --> 03:44.007
- But I'm not to be trusted, am I?
- No, sir.

03:44.174 --> 03:46.574
Stop. Shut up. I have to go.

03:46.744 --> 03:49.577
But if I find one single dog hair
when I get back...

03:49.747 --> 03:52.011
I'll rub sand in your dead little eyes.

03:52.182 --> 03:54.309
Very good, sir.

03:54.852 --> 03:56.820
- I also need you to go buy sand.
- Yes, sir.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.716
I don't know if they grade it but...

04:01.225 --> 04:02.385
Coarse.

04:09.266 --> 04:12.929
One entire whole week
we've been calling you.

04:13.103 --> 04:14.127
Highly unprofessional.

04:14.305 --> 04:17.365
Really? Because I find
your sweatiness unprofessional.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.331
So we have something in common.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.445
Besides the fact
that now both of our shirts reek of curry.

04:22.613 --> 04:26.276
- And when will you settle your account?
- When will you buy some dress shields?

04:26.450 --> 04:31.251
- This is not a dress.
- Are you serious? That's not a dress?

04:32.990 --> 04:35.185
Oh, God, with the curry again.

04:35.359 --> 04:38.089
This shirt smells
like Indira Gandhi's thong.

04:41.598 --> 04:44.396
- Hey, you wanna smell something?
- Swear to God, Mr. Archer...

04:44.568 --> 04:46.866
I have H.R. On speed dial.
- Shut up.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.369
Hey, Krieger, you gotta smell this.

04:50.074 --> 04:52.269
Krieger? Huh.

04:52.910 --> 04:54.434
You geeks wanna smell something?

04:54.611 --> 04:57.307
- Archer, get the hell out.
- What is it with you people?

04:57.481 --> 05:00.075
Try to include people in your life
and then you... Lana.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.582
Hey. Hey, what does this smell like?

05:02.753 --> 05:06.883
Like the dysfunctional asshole
I broke up with six months ago.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.454
Oh, my God. You're amazing.

05:09.626 --> 05:11.093
You are amazing, sweet stuff.

05:11.261 --> 05:13.695
Wanna do it again
and put on some interracial porn?

05:13.864 --> 05:17.857
God, it's like my brain's that tree,
and you're those little cookie elves.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.260
Just a second.

05:20.437 --> 05:23.565
- No, baby, don't answer that.
- I have to. Sorry, it's Mother.

05:23.741 --> 05:26.175
- Mother, hey. Just a second.
- I cannot believe you.

05:26.343 --> 05:29.540
No, turn it on. I can do both.

05:30.481 --> 05:33.575
- What?
- So don't speak to me, ever.

05:33.751 --> 05:37.585
And while you're not ever speaking to me,
jump up your own ass and die.

05:37.755 --> 05:40.690
Oh, rea... After all that H.R. Mediation.
Really?

05:40.858 --> 05:42.985
- Yup.
- After all the hard work Pam did.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.525
- Is that Archer?
- Goddamn it.

05:44.695 --> 05:46.026
- Archer, hey.
- Go away.

05:46.196 --> 05:48.187
- About your operations account...
- Not...

05:48.365 --> 05:49.923
- Cyril, not now.
- Yes, now.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.591
- Not a good time.
- You've got serious discrepancies...

05:52.770 --> 05:54.431
in your account.
- No, Cyril.

05:54.605 --> 05:58.371
I'm sure you wouldn't use operational funds
for personal expenses.

06:02.012 --> 06:03.377
Come on, 22 black.

06:03.547 --> 06:06.015
Twenty-two black. Twenty-two.

06:06.183 --> 06:08.845
Black. Ass. Son of a bitch. Heh.

06:09.586 --> 06:14.353
Not you, giant African man.
I'm sorry. Can I offer you a drink?

06:14.525 --> 06:16.857
How about this expensive prostitute?

06:17.027 --> 06:19.291
That is a very serious implication, Cyril.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.055
Well, so is embezzlement.

06:21.231 --> 06:25.292
Yeah? Well, so is the fact that you,
some crazy-how, are screwing my ex.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.733
- Archer, please. That's private.
- Not calm enough?

06:27.905 --> 06:29.896
You all know about Cyril and Lana, right?

06:30.074 --> 06:33.373
Of course, because if Pam knows,
then everybody knows...

06:33.544 --> 06:36.536
because of Pam's huge mouth.
Right, Pam?

06:36.713 --> 06:40.809
H.R. Mediations are supposed
to be confidential, Pam, you manatee.

06:41.819 --> 06:45.016
- And as for you, Cyril, good day, sir.
- Archer.

06:45.189 --> 06:48.317
Hey, wait. What about your account?
Oh, I get it.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.357
Classic misdirection.

06:52.596 --> 06:55.360
No, don't. You're so ugly when you cry.

06:55.866 --> 06:57.060
- Mr. Archer.
- I'm fine.

06:57.234 --> 06:59.259
Is she in or out eating a baby?

06:59.436 --> 07:02.098
- You stood me up again last night.
- Last...?

07:02.272 --> 07:05.503
Oh, yeah. Oh, my. What happened was...

07:05.676 --> 07:09.510
<i>Did you see Brian's Song?
Same thing pretty much happened.</i>

07:10.414 --> 07:14.043
I helped a guy with cancer.
Look, I'm really sorry, Carol, but I couldn't...

07:14.218 --> 07:15.276
It's Cheryl.

07:15.452 --> 07:18.387
I know, Ca... Cheryl.
So to make it up to you...

07:20.257 --> 07:21.884
- I'm ready.
...could you buzz me in?

07:22.059 --> 07:25.426
Ugh. Is that all you have to say?

07:27.531 --> 07:28.896
Yes.

07:30.467 --> 07:32.196
Now tell me again how...

07:32.369 --> 07:35.099
No, not that part. Go back. Yes.

07:35.439 --> 07:39.808
The pepper. Oh, yes, God. Oh, God.

07:39.977 --> 07:42.445
Oh, goddamn it.

07:42.613 --> 07:44.604
What the hell are you doing?

07:44.781 --> 07:45.907
What are you doing?

07:46.083 --> 07:48.415
L... I'm...

07:48.585 --> 07:52.180
For your information, I've just been
reviewing your operations account.

07:52.356 --> 07:54.483
- No. No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

07:54.658 --> 07:55.989
- Yes. Yes.
- No. No.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.957
And it makes for fascinating reading.

07:58.128 --> 07:59.652
- No.
- Let's see.

07:59.830 --> 08:02.560
You turned in an expense report
from Berlin...

08:02.733 --> 08:05.167
where the German desk says
you never checked in.

08:05.335 --> 08:07.633
- Oh, Berlin was...
- Ditto Buenos Aires.

08:07.804 --> 08:09.601
- Too busy to check in?
- There was... Yeah.

08:09.773 --> 08:10.797
Already off to Monaco?

08:10.974 --> 08:13.943
- I'm spying.
- Or was it Mallorca? Oh.

08:14.111 --> 08:17.012
- Or Tunis?
- Tunis kind of rings a bell.

08:17.181 --> 08:19.775
ISIS isn't your own personal
travel agency.

08:19.950 --> 08:24.114
It doesn't exist just so you can jet off
to Whore Island.

08:24.288 --> 08:26.620
That's not a real place.

08:26.790 --> 08:30.419
I have 50 agents who'd literally kill
to move up to your position.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.323
If you don't square
your operations account by Monday...

08:33.496 --> 08:36.761
they won't need to.
Your position will be vacant.

08:37.366 --> 08:40.597
- Sterling.
- Hm? Sorry. I was picturing Whore Island.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.033
Have I made myself clear?

08:42.206 --> 08:44.800
Are you...?
You're looking for the answer "yes"?

08:44.975 --> 08:46.408
- Yes. Good.
- Then, yes.

08:46.577 --> 08:47.601
Then get out.

08:47.778 --> 08:50.144
And for God's sake, take a shower.

08:50.314 --> 08:51.941
Smells like a whorehouse in here.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.377
Okay. Your own fingers.

08:53.550 --> 08:55.142
- Hm?
- Nothing.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.776
Johnny Bench called.

09:01.725 --> 09:02.749
So here's the thing.

09:02.926 --> 09:06.555
I need to access my operations account
and you're preventing that.

09:06.730 --> 09:10.496
Now, we can do this easy
or we can do it hard.

09:10.667 --> 09:14.194
Your call. No? Hard it is then.

09:17.774 --> 09:19.639
- Oh, God, sorry.
Goddamn it, Archer.

09:19.810 --> 09:22.677
- I forgot that... Did I get you?
What is wrong with you?

09:22.846 --> 09:26.839
Me? Nothing. You, on the other hand,
have a bullet inside you.

09:27.017 --> 09:30.578
- I see the foot's all better.
- And I see you're still a hatchet-face prick.

09:30.754 --> 09:33.518
- Do you see that sign?
- Do you see that sign?

09:34.891 --> 09:38.827
- Well...
- That's why. So we don't get ants.

09:40.063 --> 09:43.032
Because when your co-workers
put food in the refrigerator...

09:43.200 --> 09:45.498
that's a bond of trust, okay?

09:45.836 --> 09:49.533
And if you violate that trust, or the food,
there's...

09:49.706 --> 09:51.901
There's my favorite section head.

09:52.075 --> 09:54.771
I am dealing
with the break room problem.

09:54.945 --> 09:58.108
Oh, good. You caught the...
Oh, wait I had something for this.

09:58.282 --> 09:59.874
- The Pita Predator.
- You know what?

10:00.050 --> 10:01.950
Sorry. Let's just call it what it is.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.517
- Food rapist.
- Not a pretty name, is it?

10:04.688 --> 10:07.657
Pam, if you want some food
that's supposed to be cream-filled...

10:07.824 --> 10:09.883
I offer these delicious doughnuts.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.527
Yeah?
- In exchange for a favor.

10:11.695 --> 10:12.753
- A favor?
- Yeah.

10:12.929 --> 10:15.056
After how you treated me?

10:15.232 --> 10:17.962
- **** your dolphin, Pam.
Archer, she's down, all right?

10:18.135 --> 10:20.228
- Your ******* dolphin.
She's tapping out.

10:20.404 --> 10:21.894
- You.
- I think she peed.

10:22.072 --> 10:24.267
I had to get three stitches.

10:24.441 --> 10:26.932
And I broke my watch.
And I'm sorry for that.

10:27.110 --> 10:30.671
- Three...
- But I need your help, Pam, because I'm...

10:30.847 --> 10:33.611
um, conducting a mole hunt.

10:33.784 --> 10:34.978
- Aah.
- Gasp you should...

10:35.152 --> 10:37.950
because if you let me
in the mainframe, I'll drop these doughnuts.

10:38.121 --> 10:42.615
Then you can pretend they're marbles
and you're a hungry, hungry...

10:44.961 --> 10:47.191
hungry hippo.

10:47.364 --> 10:51.926
Lana. Hey, I know I'm supposed to be
up my own ass right now but...

10:53.470 --> 10:55.131
- Oh, is that what you want?
Yup.

10:55.305 --> 10:58.138
- Because that's how you get ants.
Yay.

10:58.608 --> 11:00.769
Cyril, my favorite section head.

11:00.944 --> 11:04.311
- What do you want?
- To apologize for my behavior.

11:04.481 --> 11:05.914
- Well...
- And also to...

11:06.083 --> 11:09.450
- What are you doing?
- Oh, just dicing veggies for dinner.

11:09.619 --> 11:12.315
- I always make Lana stir-fry on Friday.
- Neat. Listen...

11:12.489 --> 11:15.686
- Guess what we call it.
- Stir Friday?

11:16.626 --> 11:18.856
- Wow, that's actually better.
- Yup.

11:19.029 --> 11:21.224
It's all yours.
So come let me in the mainframe.

11:21.398 --> 11:23.958
Is this about your operations account?

11:24.134 --> 11:25.499
- No. Cyril...
- Yeah?

11:25.669 --> 11:27.694
I'm on a top-secret mole hunt.

11:27.871 --> 11:29.304
Oh, yeah, Pam mentioned that.

11:29.473 --> 11:31.941
- Wha...? When?
- Well, she called a minute ago.

11:32.109 --> 11:35.442
- You know how Pam loves to gossip.
- Yeah. I need rug marbles. I know.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.409
- Come let me into the mainframe.
- Okay.

11:37.581 --> 11:41.312
- I need to confirm this with your mother.
- No. No. I mean, what? Cyril.

11:42.052 --> 11:44.953
- What if she is the mole? Think about it.
- Your own mother.

11:45.122 --> 11:47.989
Think what that would do to me
if we had to kill her...

11:48.158 --> 11:51.855
- Archer.
...by stabbing her wrinkly neck...

11:52.028 --> 11:54.690
with a knife?
- Yeah. I can't let you in there.

11:54.865 --> 11:57.197
Can't or won't?

11:57.534 --> 11:59.968
- Either?
- And after I gave you Stir Friday.

12:00.137 --> 12:01.468
- That is much better.
- I know.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.630
- But if you wanna access the mainframe...
- What?

12:04.808 --> 12:07.208
I guess you'd have to break in.

12:08.345 --> 12:12.076
Break in to the ISIS mainframe.

12:12.249 --> 12:16.481
Which is obviously ludicrous.
As is this baby corn.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.780
What is that about? Archer?

12:19.356 --> 12:23.554
<i>ISIS headquarters makes Fort Knox
look like a gingerbread house.</i>

12:23.727 --> 12:25.285
<i>Only two means of ingress.</i>

12:25.462 --> 12:30.024
<i>The first, at street level.
Impenetrable after 6.</i>

12:30.734 --> 12:32.861
<i>The second, through an access door
on the roof.</i>

12:33.036 --> 12:35.561
<i>Inexplicably unprotected.</i>

12:37.174 --> 12:40.109
<i>But even if you zip-lined across...</i>

12:40.277 --> 12:41.767
<i>... reached the access door...</i>

12:41.945 --> 12:44.209
<i>... and somehow made it
into ISIS headquarters...</i>

12:44.381 --> 12:47.714
<i>... you'd still have to find the mainframe.</i>

12:48.118 --> 12:50.450
<i>But, wait, it gets worse.</i>

12:50.720 --> 12:53.348
<i>Inside, there are three
countermeasure systems.</i>

12:53.523 --> 12:55.787
<i>The first is pressure sensitive in the floor.</i>

12:55.959 --> 12:57.426
<i>Even a mouse triggers it.</i>

12:57.594 --> 13:01.963
<i>The second is sound sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off.</i>

13:02.132 --> 13:05.397
<i>And the third system
is state-of-the-art voice activation.</i>

13:05.569 --> 13:08.094
Cyril Figgis.

13:11.741 --> 13:14.073
So, obviously,
it would be a lot easier for me...

13:14.244 --> 13:18.374
if you just disabled all that
when you left work tonight... somehow.

13:18.548 --> 13:23.485
- Ooh. That would make me uncomfortable.
- Yeah.

13:23.653 --> 13:25.917
Oh, God,
everything makes you uncomfortable.

13:27.424 --> 13:28.823
Just the tip?

13:28.992 --> 13:30.584
Just the tip.

13:30.861 --> 13:32.761
Just the tip.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.156
How was I to know
you're lactose intolerant?

13:35.332 --> 13:36.697
Because I kept screaming it.

13:36.867 --> 13:37.993
- Well, what?
- And this...

13:38.168 --> 13:39.601
I'm just a secretary.

13:39.769 --> 13:43.671
- I don't have access to security whatevers.
- What?

13:43.840 --> 13:46.308
- Then get them from Cyril.
- How would I do that?

13:46.476 --> 13:50.503
- Seduce him or Pam, or both.
- I can't do that.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.272
- Can't or won't?
- Either.

13:52.449 --> 13:55.145
That's how you wanna play it? Fine.

13:55.619 --> 13:58.315
- Are you gonna pay for your lunch?
- Just the tip.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.782
Actually, I don't have any cash.

14:03.527 --> 14:07.827
Can you get it? Sorry.
I also need cab fare.

14:09.299 --> 14:10.823
Oh, ugly duckling.

14:11.001 --> 14:12.730
Bock, bock.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.934
So thanks for nothing, Carol.

14:18.108 --> 14:22.135
Now I have to break into ISIS headquarters
in a $900 turtleneck.

14:22.312 --> 14:23.540
And if it gets ruined...

14:23.713 --> 14:27.149
I'm gonna make you drink
heavy cream, you...

14:27.317 --> 14:28.341
Carol.

14:33.189 --> 14:35.817
Wow, that was actually pretty easy.
Thanks, new turtleneck.

14:37.527 --> 14:39.392
Oh, and thank you, duffel bag.

14:39.563 --> 14:41.360
Jesus, what else could go wrong?

14:50.006 --> 14:52.406
Exactly. You're not Archer.
That's what's so great about you.

14:53.944 --> 14:55.536
And the fact
your mother died in a fire.

14:55.879 --> 14:58.177
- What?
- I said where are we on that stir-fry?

14:58.348 --> 15:00.475
Agent Kane. What?

15:00.650 --> 15:01.708
Yes, confirmed.

15:01.885 --> 15:05.821
Confirmed a naughty nellie's breaking
our after-work phone rule.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.287
- Cyril, there's been a break-in at ISIS.
- What?

15:08.458 --> 15:10.323
- Think it's the mole?
- God, you and Pam...

15:10.493 --> 15:12.324
- Pam's all right.
- Wow.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.224
Okay. I've got to go.

15:14.397 --> 15:16.763
- But it's Stir Friday.
- Hurray.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.369
- But if I'm not here...
- Yeah.

15:22.105 --> 15:25.700
Because after three months
of whatever it is we're doing...

15:25.875 --> 15:28.810
it's weird that you can't leave me alone
in your apartment.

15:28.979 --> 15:31.777
- I know I have trust issues, all right?
- But it's...

15:31.948 --> 15:34.143
- It's Archer's fault I'm like this.
- Here we go.

15:34.317 --> 15:37.343
- All of those years of lying and cheating.
- It's fine.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.215
That thing with the mayonnaise.

15:39.389 --> 15:41.448
- How messed up he is about his mother.
- Fine.

15:41.625 --> 15:44.059
Do you know he called out her name once
when we f...?

15:44.227 --> 15:47.754
Fine!

15:49.132 --> 15:51.930
- And here we are. All fine.
- Cyril, come on, hon, please?

15:53.303 --> 15:54.895
Now who's a naughty nellie?

15:55.071 --> 15:56.129
<i>- Hello?
Hi, who's this?</i>

15:56.306 --> 15:57.967
Cyril Figgis.

15:58.141 --> 15:59.870
I'm sorry. Did you say Faggis?

16:00.043 --> 16:02.568
- Figgis. Figgis.
- Who is it? Better not be Pam.

16:02.746 --> 16:04.805
<i>Not Faggis?
- Figgis. I was very clear.</i>

16:04.981 --> 16:07.313
Hi, I'm a huge fan of cock
and my name is...

16:07.484 --> 16:09.281
<i>Cyril Figgis.</i>

16:12.789 --> 16:15.724
Holy shit. Our security is atrocious.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.621
Seriously, it's really bad.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.585
Password.

16:19.896 --> 16:23.525
Hm. Password. How about "guest"?

16:23.700 --> 16:25.167
No way.

16:25.335 --> 16:29.965
It can't be.
Jesus Christ, that is just Baby Town frolics.

16:30.140 --> 16:34.236
Okay, operations account.
Just how deep in the red am I?

16:34.411 --> 16:36.902
Out of my mind. Oh, no.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.947
How? How did I spend that much money?

16:40.283 --> 16:42.945
Yeah, I know it's sexy, Woodhouse.
That's why I bought 10.

16:43.119 --> 16:44.609
Now arrange those by color.

16:44.788 --> 16:46.483
These are all black.

16:46.656 --> 16:52.117
Oh, are they? Or are five in a dark black
and five in a slightly darker black?

16:52.295 --> 16:55.890
And now I'm short
a slightly darker black one.

16:56.066 --> 16:58.534
So let's just put all my expenses...

16:58.702 --> 17:02.695
into some pathetic idiot's account
by the name of...

17:04.007 --> 17:05.941
Oh, Krenshaw.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.737
- Oh. Now that's not very nice.
- Oh, God.

17:08.912 --> 17:13.940
Hey, I was... I was just talking about you.
And about how this isn't what it looks like.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.608
- A lot of that going around.
- Yeah. It's an epidemic.

17:16.786 --> 17:20.017
For example, my real name is Kremenski.

17:20.190 --> 17:23.387
- Is that sound...? Is that Jewish?
- It's Russian.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.357
Um...

17:26.730 --> 17:28.459
- Russian-Jewish?
- I'm the mole, idiot.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.189
What? I made up the mole.

17:30.366 --> 17:33.802
Yes, but you told Pam
and now everyone is looking for a real mole.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.164
God, do we hate Pam.

17:35.338 --> 17:37.238
- So I have to escape.
- And irony.

17:37.407 --> 17:39.568
Thanks for breaking
into the mainframe for me.

17:39.743 --> 17:42.610
- Double irony.
- I'll need 50,000 for travel expenses.

17:42.779 --> 17:44.474
- Fifty thousand?
- From your account.

17:44.647 --> 17:48.378
- That's too much.
- It's all last-minute bookings for two.

17:48.551 --> 17:51.247
Wha...? Oh.

17:51.421 --> 17:54.549
Because when I hand
the notorious Duchess to the KGB...

17:54.724 --> 17:57.352
I won't just get a promotion,
I'll get my own dacha.

17:57.527 --> 17:59.688
- Too bad you'll never see it.
- What the...?

18:01.664 --> 18:03.359
Lana, Krenshaw's a mole.

18:03.533 --> 18:06.093
And his name's not really Krenshaw,
it's Kremenski.

18:06.269 --> 18:09.864
Definitely Russian, possibly a Jew.
I don't know. Thoughts?

18:10.039 --> 18:12.530
Yeah. Shut up. And you, drop it.

18:12.709 --> 18:15.041
- Or what?
- No, no, no. Do not wind her up.

18:15.211 --> 18:17.941
That is a big gun, and she is baby crazy.

18:18.581 --> 18:21.072
- Baby crazy?
- That's why I dumped her.

18:21.251 --> 18:23.276
- You little... You sack of shit.
- What? What?

18:23.453 --> 18:28.322
I dumped you because you're dragging
around a 35-year-old umbilical cord.

18:28.491 --> 18:32.393
See? All you talk about is baby shit
because you're baby crazy.

18:32.562 --> 18:35.554
- You wanna see crazy?
- No, I've seen that movie...

18:35.732 --> 18:39.725
and spoiler alert,
it ends with a closetful of my suits on fire.

18:39.903 --> 18:43.771
- I wish you'd been wearing one.
- Who would want to wear an on-fire suit?

18:43.940 --> 18:45.805
- Cosplay enthusiasts.
- What?

18:45.975 --> 18:49.274
Do you even hear
how totally batshit insane you sound?

18:49.445 --> 18:50.776
I'll tell you what I hear.

18:55.885 --> 18:58.046
Yeah, please keep talking.

18:58.221 --> 19:01.384
So why are you sitting here in the car
eating stir-fry?

19:01.558 --> 19:05.654
Oh, it's Stir Friday. And Lana said to.

19:05.829 --> 19:07.558
Krenshaw?
- Ms. Archer?

19:07.730 --> 19:10.824
- What's this flap about a break-in?
- Mother, look out.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.092
Krenshaw is a mole.

19:12.268 --> 19:15.499
Oh, Pam's just full of crap
as she is of carbohydrates.

19:15.672 --> 19:18.766
- Now... Hey.
- Not this time, you impossible bitch.

19:18.942 --> 19:20.807
Also, you should all be nicer to Pam.

19:20.977 --> 19:23.468
- I am always nice to her.
- To her face.

19:23.646 --> 19:26.740
- Why aren't you in the car?
- Will somebody do something?

19:27.784 --> 19:29.274
What are you doing, you idiot?

19:29.452 --> 19:31.750
Shut up. It's classic misdirection.

19:31.921 --> 19:35.357
Looks like we've got
a Mexican standoff, Kremenski.

19:35.525 --> 19:37.356
How is this a Mexican standoff?

19:37.527 --> 19:40.121
- Dumb-ass.
I don't care if you shoot her.

19:40.296 --> 19:44.027
- I do.
- But what if I shoot her, mama's boy?

19:44.200 --> 19:46.031
Sterling?
- Yes.

19:46.202 --> 19:48.670
- Picture her dead in the gutter...
- Sterling.

19:48.838 --> 19:52.968
And what your pathetic life will be like
without old Mommy dearest.

19:53.142 --> 19:54.541
Jesus Christ.

19:54.711 --> 19:56.406
What is it?
- He's got an erection.

19:56.579 --> 19:59.104
What?
- What the hell is wrong with you people?

20:01.317 --> 20:03.945
Nothing. You, on the other hand...
Ow. Ow.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.678
- An erection?
- Ow. Hey.

20:05.855 --> 20:07.083
What's in there, buckles?

20:07.257 --> 20:10.090
The thought of me dead
gives you an erection?

20:10.260 --> 20:11.989
No, just half of one.

20:12.161 --> 20:16.063
The other half would have really
missed you. I mean, not...

20:16.366 --> 20:17.560
- Oh.
- Ugh.

20:19.535 --> 20:21.025
Johnny Bench called.

20:21.304 --> 20:24.740
Yep. See here, Krenshaw just stole 50,000
from Archer's account.

20:24.908 --> 20:28.344
- Must have been doing it all along.
- Apology accepted, ass douche.

20:28.511 --> 20:30.411
- What?
Call him that again...

20:30.580 --> 20:32.013
- Make me.
What?

20:32.181 --> 20:34.149
- Do you see this?
- I just don't understand.

20:34.317 --> 20:38.048
- This is a hostile work environment.
- I would have known if we had a mole.

20:38.221 --> 20:39.654
- How?
- How what, dear?

20:39.822 --> 20:42.848
- How could you know if we had a mole?
- Um...

20:43.026 --> 20:46.655
Then I am taking hot pepper...

20:47.196 --> 20:51.997
<i>and slowly I am rubbing it around...
Goddamn it.</i>

20:52.235 --> 20:54.863
Hello? Darling?

20:55.138 --> 20:59.199
- Who was this?
- Who are you, Comrade Question?

20:59.375 --> 21:01.343
And who are you, Comrade Questions?

21:01.511 --> 21:02.739
- Comrade...?
- Oh, shut up.

21:02.912 --> 21:04.345
You and your erection.

21:04.514 --> 21:07.074
- And why are there doughnuts everywhere?
- Lana did that.

21:07.250 --> 21:11.550
Do you want ants?
Because that's how you get ants.
