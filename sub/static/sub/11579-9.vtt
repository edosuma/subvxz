NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.570 --> 00:07.233
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:07.307 --> 00:08.399
In New York City,

00:08.475 --> 00:11.410
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.478 --> 00:15.005
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:15.081 --> 00:16.946
These are their stories,

00:18.685 --> 00:20.915
Damn it to crap, Brody.

00:20.987 --> 00:22.716
We're only a day
behind schedule.

00:22.789 --> 00:24.780
Yeah, well,
I got drywallers starting.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.827
So I suggest you shift
your Iazy ass into high gear.

00:27.894 --> 00:30.158
Catch the hell up.

00:30.230 --> 00:33.791
Maybe you should think twice
before insulting a man
wearing a tool belt.

00:33.867 --> 00:37.325
Yeah, you know,
if you weren't married
to my sister...

00:39.472 --> 00:41.440
What the hell is this?

00:42.642 --> 00:44.940
That wasn't here
when we Ieft.

00:48.681 --> 00:50.546
CONTRACTOR: Son of a bitch.

00:50.617 --> 00:53.643
The Iittle girl's body
was discovered by the general
contractor and a carpenter

00:53.720 --> 00:56.154
at 6:53 a.m.
This our point of entry?

00:56.222 --> 00:59.680
Yeah, one nail holding a piece
of plywood. Didn't take
a Herculean effort.

00:59.759 --> 01:03.354
And they both
handled the sword,
so it's contaminated.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.397
She was killed with a sword?

01:05.465 --> 01:06.796
No stab wounds,

01:06.866 --> 01:09.699
but hematemesis indicates
internal bleeding.

01:09.769 --> 01:13.000
BIunt force trauma.
Bruises, sternum to toe.

01:13.706 --> 01:16.266
With this?
We'II check it
for trace evidence.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.037
Looks Iike it was made here
out of floor scraps.

01:18.111 --> 01:19.203
Is this the victim's braid?

01:19.279 --> 01:23.079
Looks Iike it.
I'd say cut with a knife,
not scissors.

01:23.149 --> 01:25.777
Restraint marks on the wrists
and ankles. Where's the rope?

01:25.852 --> 01:27.217
Didn't find any.

01:27.287 --> 01:29.255
Signs of sexual abuse?

01:29.322 --> 01:33.588
Extensive bruising
and swelling in the pelvic
region. I'II run a kit.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.150
What's her name?
Any idea who killed her?

01:35.228 --> 01:38.163
AII right, guys, please.
That's enough. This way,
ma'am, please. Come on.

01:38.231 --> 01:39.596
I went in to check on my...
I understand.

01:39.666 --> 01:40.690
...my Iittle girl.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.530
But Cassie wasn't
in her bed, and I...

01:42.602 --> 01:44.092
How old is your daughter?

01:44.170 --> 01:45.899
She's five.
She's my foster daughter.

01:45.972 --> 01:47.337
Okay.
Can you describe her for us?

01:47.407 --> 01:51.400
She's black. She got her hair
in Iittle braids.

01:51.478 --> 01:52.843
She's, Iike, 40 pounds.

01:52.912 --> 01:55.380
Why don't you come with me,
okay?

01:55.448 --> 01:57.473
WOMAN:
Excuse me, sir. Pardon me.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.450
Sound Iike we have an ID?
Yeah, it's bad.

01:59.519 --> 02:02.454
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Captain Cragen,
can you give us anything?

02:02.522 --> 02:04.422
We'II have a statement
shortly.

02:04.491 --> 02:07.756

03:00.547 --> 03:02.708
Victim is Cassie Adams,
aged five.

03:02.782 --> 03:06.218
She was found beaten to death
at a construction site
across her street.

03:06.286 --> 03:07.878
FIN: Someone snatched her
right out of bed.

03:07.954 --> 03:10.616
Foster mom said they'd
been having problems
with her sleepwalking.

03:10.690 --> 03:11.782
Is there a foster dad?

03:11.858 --> 03:13.120
Everything but.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.060
Foster mom,
foster grandmother,
the victim's two sisters.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.689
I believe the grandmother
has a foster kid of her own.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.756
Full house.
What's this, a sword?

03:20.833 --> 03:22.892
Yeah, with the victim's braid
attached.

03:22.969 --> 03:25.130
Some kind of ritual killing?
Or a gang symbol.

03:25.205 --> 03:29.005
There's a crew on 149th Street
that wears a Sword
of Damascus tat.

03:29.075 --> 03:31.236
Could be the prop
of some whack job.

03:31.311 --> 03:32.778
Or an ex-con.

03:32.845 --> 03:35.279
This is basically
a big old shiv.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.578
Well, Iet's start with known
pedophiles in the area.

03:37.650 --> 03:40.619
Canvass the block.
Let's find out
who had access to that site.

03:40.687 --> 03:44.123
Oh, and check out this
address. It was on the victim.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.624
We ran it, but there's
no phone connected.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.160
Want us to interview
the foster family?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.253
Benson and Stabler
are there right now.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.195

03:59.038 --> 04:00.266
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Level 7,

04:00.340 --> 04:03.867
Tanya, now when did you
Iast see Cassie?

04:03.943 --> 04:06.673
When I went to bed.
Okay.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.442
GIenn, honey,
turn that thing down.

04:09.515 --> 04:10.709
WHITLEY: Grandma.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.914
And did you hear anything
Iast night?
No.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.112
(SOBBING)

04:19.425 --> 04:21.358
STABLER: We're good?
Yeah.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.118
Which one was Cassie's bed?

04:23.196 --> 04:26.165
The bottom bunk.
Tanya has the top.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.125
And Whitley's
is three feet away.

04:29.202 --> 04:32.569
AII they know is she was gone
when they woke up.

04:32.639 --> 04:34.766
Well, we'd Iike to take
everyone down to our precinct.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.900
Fewer distractions,
they might remember something.

04:36.976 --> 04:41.072
They have been through
so much. The dad died in jail.

04:41.147 --> 04:44.173
The mom used to drag them out
panhandling.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.979
She'd use them as sympathy.

04:46.052 --> 04:49.249
Mother still in the picture?
No. Supervised visits.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.688
We'd meet her at McDonald's
every two weeks.

04:51.758 --> 04:56.559
It always really upset Cassie
for days after.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.790
When was the Iast visitation?

04:58.865 --> 05:00.492
Day and a half ago.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.796
And it's only the mom
on these visits?

05:02.869 --> 05:06.032
She brought her boyfriend
the Iast time.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.573
Made the girls
very uncomfortable.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.880
FIN: Do you know
a Cassie Adams?

05:15.948 --> 05:19.076
How's that concern you?
Take that as a yes.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.586
Why are you asking
about my daughter?

05:22.388 --> 05:25.152
Child Services
didn't contact you?

05:26.492 --> 05:27.891
About what?

05:28.728 --> 05:33.358
We're very sorry to have to
tell you this, but your
daughter Cassie is dead.

05:35.535 --> 05:36.695
No.

05:38.171 --> 05:42.164
No! God, no! No, no, no!

05:42.241 --> 05:46.678
No! No! No!

05:49.882 --> 05:52.112
Anger management
an issue with her?

05:52.185 --> 05:55.450
At ACS, yeah, man.
She was fighting Iike hell
to get them back.

05:55.521 --> 05:59.480
So having a close friend
snatch one back
isn't out of the question.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.319
You know, girl doesn't want
to go, puts up a struggle.

06:03.396 --> 06:05.057
Accidents happen.

06:05.998 --> 06:08.558
Why you talking to me
Iike I'm a suspect?

06:08.634 --> 06:12.035
Account for your whereabouts
Iast night
and I'II adjust my tone.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.266
I play sax at Harvel's.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.171
I just got Tashandra a job
waitressing there,

06:16.242 --> 06:18.437
and we were both there
until 3:00 this morning.

06:18.511 --> 06:20.706
Tashandra Iives here with you?

06:20.780 --> 06:23.647
Officially,
she's still at the shelter,
but she's spending nights.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.583
Then why was Cassie
carrying this address?

06:27.854 --> 06:29.515
I don't know.
You gotta ask Shandra.

06:29.589 --> 06:32.353
I always wrote down
where I was for her.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.087
It was a comfort.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.257
I need to be with my babies.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.559
They're okay.

06:39.632 --> 06:42.931
They're with the detectives
trying to sort this out.

06:43.002 --> 06:48.963
You know, Cassie's
my middle child, but she was
always the mother hen.

06:50.376 --> 06:53.311
And I don't know
what Whitley and Tanya
are going to do without her.

06:53.379 --> 06:55.279
How Iong have you been apart?

06:55.348 --> 06:57.612
Ten months.

06:58.384 --> 07:00.113
I'II get them back now,
won't I?

07:00.186 --> 07:01.653
It's up to
Children's Services.

07:01.721 --> 07:06.021
But it's their fault.
They stole my kids.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.721
I thought if I had my girls
with me, I could protect them.

07:10.463 --> 07:14.422
You tell them
that I need to protect
the two that I got Ieft.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.331
That's not my call.

07:16.702 --> 07:19.500
You have to take me
to see them.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.238
I'm sorry, I really can't.
PIease.

07:23.309 --> 07:27.473
PIease, don't make me
have to go to them and beg.

07:28.981 --> 07:30.209
PIease.

07:34.554 --> 07:37.648
Liv's upstairs with
the eight-year-old sister,
Wong's got the three-year-old,

07:37.723 --> 07:39.156
and I'm running out of rooms.

07:39.225 --> 07:42.388
I'II put up a "Do Not Disturb"
sign. Talk to the boy
in observation...

07:42.462 --> 07:43.622
You Iousy bitch!
MUNCH: Tashandra...

07:43.696 --> 07:46.859
What did you do to
my daughter? What did you do
to my daughter?

07:46.933 --> 07:49.697
MUNCH: Tashandra, please,
this isn't helping.
How could you Iet this happen?

07:49.769 --> 07:51.498
Calm down, ma'am,
okay, calm down.

07:51.571 --> 07:55.007
No, no, I want to see
my daughters. Whitley! Tanya!

07:55.074 --> 07:56.200
My office here. Let's go.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.471
Here's your juice.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.710
So Tanya, can you tell me
what happened Iast night?

08:06.519 --> 08:08.043
I don't know.

08:09.922 --> 08:13.016
Well, when you went to bed,
who was in the room?

08:14.260 --> 08:16.023
Whitley and Cassie.

08:16.796 --> 08:21.358
Tanya, we know that Cassie
Ieft the room Iast night,
but do you know how?

08:24.370 --> 08:25.564
No.

08:28.541 --> 08:31.408
Hey, GIenn,
tell me about Cassie.

08:33.880 --> 08:38.340
She was always bugging me
to use my PIayStation,
but she was too Iittle.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.851
I wish I had Iet her now.

08:43.121 --> 08:47.422
It must have been hard
for you, all of a sudden
having three sisters.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.220
No.

08:50.162 --> 08:53.154
I Iike being a big brother.
Do you?

08:54.333 --> 08:56.062
You Iook out for them?

08:56.135 --> 08:57.432
I try to.

09:01.674 --> 09:04.734
Did you ever go over
to the construction site?

09:04.810 --> 09:05.936
Yeah.

09:07.513 --> 09:09.174
How about Cassie?

09:10.917 --> 09:14.114
She's not supposed to cross
the street by herself.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.645
She'd ask me to take her.

09:17.757 --> 09:18.917
Why?

09:19.525 --> 09:22.255
She Iikes to talk
to one of the workers.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.596
Did you and Cassie ever go
to the building site
without GIenn?

09:30.670 --> 09:31.898
Mmm-hmm.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.841
And when you guys
would go over there,
who would Cassie talk to?

09:35.908 --> 09:38.172
Danny.
Who's Danny?

09:39.378 --> 09:42.745
He's nice.
The other ones chased us away.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.947
Oh. How is Danny nice?

09:46.619 --> 09:50.146
He gave us gum
and showed us stuff
in the house.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.456
CONTRACTOR:
Gotta be Danny Marston.

09:54.527 --> 09:57.087
MUNCH: You don't mind him
conducting his Fun Time
Learning Emporium

09:57.163 --> 09:58.187
on company time?

09:58.264 --> 10:00.255
Hey, Danny's one of
the hardest workers I got.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.631
Guy that's good with kids
must have a bunch of his own.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.602
Not yet.
But he coaches Little League

10:04.670 --> 10:07.002
and he volunteers
in a bunch of youth programs.

10:07.073 --> 10:08.665
Where's Danny now?

10:08.741 --> 10:11.869
I had to send my whole crew
home after you declared it
a crime scene.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.241
Where's he hang his hardhat?

10:13.312 --> 10:15.576
My secretary can give you
his address.

10:15.648 --> 10:19.414
If he's not at home,
try the Youth Rec Center
on 123rd.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.043
Guy's a saint.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.082
MUNCH: Danny Marston?
Yeah.

10:27.159 --> 10:29.127
Steal a minute
of your time?

10:29.195 --> 10:30.219
Sure.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.355
Hey, keep it going guys.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.302
Little girl was found dead
at your place of work.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.099
We understand that you and her
were buddies.

10:39.171 --> 10:40.661
God, it's tragic.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.935
I mean, she came around
every day.

10:43.009 --> 10:45.239
Budding architect, asking me
hundreds of questions.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.972
See, he wasn't being
inappropriately friendly,

10:47.046 --> 10:49.571
he was schmoozing up
a future boss.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.472
Inappropriate?

10:52.818 --> 10:56.447
Listen, the kid never had
a father figure.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.053
I mean,
most of the kids I work with
are in that situation.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.116
You make toys
for all of them?

11:01.193 --> 11:05.357
I made her a Iittle airplane
out of scrap.
Took all of two seconds.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.029
What?
Where were you Iast night?

11:08.100 --> 11:10.466
Home.
FIN: Can anyone verify that?

11:10.536 --> 11:11.798
No.

11:12.438 --> 11:13.905
Why would they need to?

11:13.973 --> 11:16.840
Maybe we should finish this
down at the squad room.

11:19.478 --> 11:20.843
We're in the middle
of a game here.

11:20.913 --> 11:22.710
You really want to
do this in front of them?

11:22.782 --> 11:24.977
Damage their Iittle psyches?

11:26.952 --> 11:29.318
Andre, take over here.

11:33.492 --> 11:35.323
I am not a pedophile.

11:36.062 --> 11:39.554
And I refuse to stop helping
kids in need just to avoid
being Iabeled one.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.156
I didn't do it.

11:42.501 --> 11:43.934
Tell me how
I prove a negative.

11:44.003 --> 11:45.436
Tell the truth.

11:46.172 --> 11:50.108
You've never seen anyone
at that construction site
after hours?

11:55.548 --> 11:59.211
I never even thought of it
until I started getting
the third degree.

12:00.319 --> 12:01.616
I Ieft my thermos there
Iast week.

12:01.687 --> 12:03.678
When I went back, a couple
of kids had broken in.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.018
Vandals?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.693
No.
Who?

12:09.862 --> 12:11.887
Cassie and an older kid.

12:12.832 --> 12:16.199
Listen, I know it Iooks bad,
but I'm sure
it's just coincidence.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.564
What is?

12:19.138 --> 12:22.403
They both had sticks.
When I went in,
they were sword fighting.

12:22.808 --> 12:25.470
You need to describe
this older kid to us.

12:28.647 --> 12:30.877
A white boy she's always with.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.509
I think his name's GIenn.

12:43.362 --> 12:44.693
Her foster brother?

12:44.764 --> 12:47.096
He had access to the home
and to the crime scene.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.997
And he did fail to mention
that his sister's murder site

12:49.068 --> 12:50.660
was also
their secret playground.

12:50.736 --> 12:53.204
This family is still grieving
the Ioss of one child.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.797
We're gonna need
a hell of a Iot more
before we take away another.

12:55.875 --> 12:59.333
It could be that he had
motive. He was an only child,
a Iittle slow.

12:59.411 --> 13:02.539
Three younger, cuter sisters
move in, attention
gets split four ways.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.515
Fourteen years old,
raging hormones.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.177
Look, before you place
this kid on death row,

13:07.253 --> 13:10.051
Iet's see if we can place him
at the crime scene.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.863
Why do we always
get stuck with Iooking for
the needle in the haystack?

13:18.931 --> 13:21.229
Takes me back to
the Easter-egg hunts
of my youth.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.097
You're Jewish.
Your parents hid eggs?

13:23.169 --> 13:26.400
My point exactly. AII those
futile hours of searching.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.542
Now, if you were still
a bright-eyed Iittle kid, what
would that Iook Iike to you?

13:31.610 --> 13:32.634
A deathtrap.

13:32.711 --> 13:35.874
You're pathetic.
That's the coolest fort ever.

13:41.020 --> 13:44.183
You had a traumatic childhood
too, huh, Sherlock?

13:48.327 --> 13:51.091
Mother Iode. Comic books.

13:52.431 --> 13:53.898
Walkman.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.331
Penknife.

13:56.135 --> 13:58.433
That Iook sharp enough
to cut off a braid of hair?

13:58.504 --> 14:01.166
If it is, you win
the chocolate bunny.

14:05.077 --> 14:07.739
GIenn's been sent
to the Guidance Center
many times.

14:07.813 --> 14:09.474
Fights?
Yeah.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.606
He's a bully?

14:10.683 --> 14:13.015
On the contrary.
He's the one bullied.

14:14.553 --> 14:18.717
This is where he spends
half his day with the other
Special Ed students.

14:18.791 --> 14:22.227
You know,
I've talked to GIenn. He's...
He's borderline.

14:22.294 --> 14:25.752
He's a Iittle slower
than the average student,
a Iittle bigger,

14:25.831 --> 14:29.767
and he won't fight back,
which makes him
a constant target.

14:29.835 --> 14:32.633
That's gotta get to him.
It did once.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.368
He threw a chair
across the room.
It exploded into pieces.

14:36.442 --> 14:39.639
Are you doing anything
to protect
these targeted kids?

14:39.912 --> 14:43.678
GIenn has a rich fantasy Iife
that he retreats to.

14:43.749 --> 14:45.876
Whenever I try to discuss
his problems,

14:45.951 --> 14:49.887
all he'II talk about is
this Camelot-type video game.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.586
Camelot? Like, jousting?
Sword-fighting?
That kind of thing?

14:53.659 --> 14:58.358
Yeah. His teachers have tried
to interest him in books
with similar mythical themes,

14:58.430 --> 15:00.830
but there's something
about this game.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.561
Graphic violence.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.297
Read his case file.
It's nothing new.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.833
GIenn was one of our
saddest cases.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.739
It's a miracle he's adjusted
as well as he has.

15:10.809 --> 15:11.833
Abuse?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.379
While his mother was out
prostituting herself
for drug money,

15:14.446 --> 15:17.074
the boyfriend was at home
molesting GIenn.

15:17.149 --> 15:19.481
Sometimes he'd resort
to objects.

15:19.551 --> 15:21.519
And when did you get him?
Not soon enough.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.522
The abuse started at two.
We got him at four.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.490
If you'd seen the emptiness
in that boy's eyes.

15:26.558 --> 15:28.082
Did he bounce around
for a Iong time?

15:28.160 --> 15:29.991
On that front he was Iucky.

15:30.062 --> 15:32.360
We placed him
with Dorothy Rudd right away.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.989
She's had him ever since.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.830
She ever have any troubles
with him?
Not that I know of.

15:36.902 --> 15:39.268
Women Iike Dorothy
are hard to find.

15:39.338 --> 15:42.501
With a Iot of these kids,
the families have no idea
what they're getting into.

15:42.574 --> 15:43.802
Still, with GIenn's
background,

15:43.876 --> 15:46.811
weren't you at all concerned
about placing three
young girls in the house?

15:46.879 --> 15:47.868
No.

15:47.947 --> 15:52.179
My case worker met with
the boy, and he seemed
very excited about it.

15:52.751 --> 15:57.188
Stainless steel.
Mass-produced.
Swiss Army knock-off.

15:57.256 --> 16:01.488
Standard issue for any boy
over eight. Anything making
this one unique?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.653
Say, maybe some kid carving
his initials in the handle?

16:03.729 --> 16:05.128
Oh, better.

16:07.032 --> 16:08.431
Ten-point gem.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.400
I ran it, but he's not
in the system.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.130
System doesn't
include juvies.

16:12.204 --> 16:16.868
The size and shape
are consistent with a boy
on the Iarge side or a woman.

16:16.942 --> 16:23.404
AIthough given these,
I'd stick with a Ionely,
frustrated adolescent.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.713
An outcast with $4-a-day
cheese puff habit.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.343
You Iift those
from the comic books?

16:28.420 --> 16:29.910
Corner of every page.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.049
The girl didn't die
from a paper cut.
Anything else on the knife?

16:34.626 --> 16:36.958
Just a hair caught
in the fold.

16:39.765 --> 16:43.201
It's the one on the Ieft.
The one on the right's
the victim's.

16:43.268 --> 16:44.428
It's identical.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.563
Which puts Cheese Puff Boy
at the crime scene
the night of the murder.

16:47.639 --> 16:49.266
Now you've just got that
one Iittle hitch.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.635
What's that?

16:51.710 --> 16:53.701
The sword is not
your murder weapon.

16:53.779 --> 16:55.610
But she was hit with it.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.275
See the imperfections
in the wood?

16:58.584 --> 17:02.418
With this Ievel of impact,
it would have picked up fiber
or soft tissue evidence.

17:02.488 --> 17:03.648
Maybe he wiped it clean.

17:03.722 --> 17:05.587
Pattern doesn't match.

17:05.656 --> 17:08.717
BIeeds spread their mass out
differently depending
on the weapon.

17:08.794 --> 17:12.958
These came from something
perfectly cylindrical
with no rough edges.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.795
Broomstick?
Baseball bat? What?

17:14.867 --> 17:17.165
Heavier than a broomstick,
narrower than a bat.

17:17.236 --> 17:20.797
There was a pile of copper
piping at the crime scene.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.067
Maybe.

17:22.141 --> 17:25.667
Whatever it was, it was hefty
enough to cause these.

17:25.743 --> 17:29.009
Subcutaneous bruises,
multiple fractures,

17:29.081 --> 17:32.244
metacarpals, tibia, humerus.

17:32.317 --> 17:33.443
STABLER: What killed her?

17:33.519 --> 17:36.386
BIed out from a Iacerated
Iiver. A slow death.

17:37.723 --> 17:38.985
Rape kit results in yet?

17:39.058 --> 17:42.357
There were no fluids.
I found no evidence
of penetration.

17:42.428 --> 17:44.259
I thought you said you did.

17:44.329 --> 17:47.628
I said there was swelling.
It was from the beating.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.294
Anything else?

17:52.371 --> 17:54.965
Look at the different hues
from the trauma.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.907
The most recent are
erythematous with welts.

17:57.976 --> 18:02.572
The purplish areas with
extravasation were already
forming hematomas.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.843
Meaning that she was beaten
over an extended period
of time.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.646
At Ieast 1 2 hours.

18:09.021 --> 18:12.457
Did you notice any bruises
on Cassie
when you put her to bed?

18:12.524 --> 18:13.616
No. But she was...

18:13.692 --> 18:17.492
Neither of us put her to bed.
She was already asleep
when we got home.

18:17.563 --> 18:18.552
You were out?

18:18.630 --> 18:20.860
Just for a few hours, yeah.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.527
Where were you?
Delia Nathan's,
right up the street.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.797
We play cards every Tuesday.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.873
Why didn't
you mention this before?

18:28.941 --> 18:30.772
Because it was a Iot earlier
in the evening.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.073
We checked in on her
when we got home.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.612
BENSON: Who was babysitting?

18:34.680 --> 18:35.738
GIenn.

18:39.518 --> 18:43.420
No, he didn't do
anything wrong.
She was tucked soundly in bed.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.787
GIenn ever play rough
with the girls?

18:47.226 --> 18:49.524
Well, he Iiked to wrestle.

18:49.595 --> 18:54.123
He's big for his age,
and sometimes he didn't know
his own strength.

18:54.199 --> 18:56.793
He did. He did play rough
with them sometimes.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.633
We're going to need to
speak with GIenn.

19:01.106 --> 19:02.164
GIenn?

19:02.241 --> 19:04.209
GIenn, honey, please...
GLENN: Just a minute.

19:04.276 --> 19:07.871
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Kill the Gorgon
or the princess shall die,

19:07.946 --> 19:09.072
Hi, GIenn.
What are you playing?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.275
GLENN: Come on, come on.
One more Ievel.

19:11.350 --> 19:14.342
DOROTHY: GIenn, stop.
This is serious.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.586
They need to talk to you now.

19:17.256 --> 19:18.484
EIIiot.

19:19.691 --> 19:21.682
Right down to the braid
of hair.

19:29.134 --> 19:31.659
GIenn, we found your sword.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.265
The one that you Ieft
with Cassie.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.572
STABLER:
Okay, what's a Gorgon?

19:42.648 --> 19:44.912
Gonna be okay, GIenn.

19:44.983 --> 19:47.474
Can you tell us what happened
that night?

19:48.487 --> 19:49.886
(MUMBLING)

19:50.789 --> 19:53.622
Got to help her...
Save Cassie...

19:53.692 --> 19:55.922
Were you watching the girls?

19:56.828 --> 20:00.093
Cassie. Cassie. Cassie.

20:00.432 --> 20:01.694
BENSON: GIenn.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.733
GIenn, do you know
how Cassie got hurt?

20:04.803 --> 20:08.364
STABLER:
Were you playing games?
Gorgon. Gorgon killed her.

20:08.974 --> 20:12.205
PIease,
I know he didn't mean to.
It had to be an accident.

20:12.277 --> 20:13.266
Mrs. Rudd...

20:13.345 --> 20:15.870
Tell them, GIenn.
Tell them it was an accident.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.815
(SHOUTING)
It was...
It's those video games.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.318
DOROTHY: Stop it.
You're hurting yourself.

20:21.486 --> 20:22.919
(SCREAMING)

20:24.189 --> 20:26.180
BENSON: GIenn.

20:27.726 --> 20:31.184
DOROTHY: You're hurting him!
You're hurting him!

20:34.733 --> 20:36.462
You're hurting him!

20:40.806 --> 20:43.741
How's GIenn doing?
Psych unit at Hillview.

20:43.809 --> 20:44.867
You read the report?

20:44.943 --> 20:49.004
Yeah. Agitation, aggression,
paranoid delusions.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.708
Your boy had
a psychotic break.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.306
AImost took our
two-way with him.

20:52.384 --> 20:55.581
His mind didn't short-circuit
for no reason. He's clearly
under tremendous pressure.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.087
Guilty conscience?

20:57.155 --> 21:00.454
Need to confess
versus self-preservation.
That'II make you crazy.

21:00.525 --> 21:02.686
MUNCH: Damn it!
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
You have lost,

21:02.761 --> 21:06.162
Pathetic. Give me that.
Show you how to do this.

21:06.231 --> 21:09.792
Maybe we should rethink
the squad room video arcade.

21:09.868 --> 21:11.768
GIenn retreated
into that game.

21:11.837 --> 21:15.136
Well, considering what he went
through his first four years
of Iife, who wouldn't?

21:15.207 --> 21:18.335
Not to mention the physical
and emotional abuse
he's taken at school.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.399
Let's just make this case.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.503
The Super Mario Brothers
up there can re-canvass.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.309
You two, go visit the boy.

21:26.518 --> 21:27.883
BENSON: Mrs. Rudd.

21:30.555 --> 21:31.579
What are you doing here?

21:31.657 --> 21:33.648
We need to see GIenn.
No, you don't.

21:33.725 --> 21:35.386
You stay away from him.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.896
That's okay. You know what?
Why don't we sit down?

21:38.964 --> 21:41.899
Tried to get him a snack.
Stuck.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.607
It's his favorite.

21:52.678 --> 21:54.305
How's GIenn holding up?

21:56.748 --> 21:59.114
I've never seen him Iike this.

21:59.518 --> 22:01.383
GIenn is...

22:02.888 --> 22:04.719
He's a sick boy.

22:05.891 --> 22:08.951
And if we do this right,
we can make sure wherever
he goes, he gets help.

22:09.027 --> 22:13.020
Maybe I was too old
when I took him in.
I thought I was up to it.

22:13.899 --> 22:15.867
But I was being selfish.

22:16.635 --> 22:19.661
It's just...
I Iove having kids around.

22:20.505 --> 22:23.633
Mrs. Rudd, you do understand
that we need to talk to GIenn.

22:23.709 --> 22:24.903
Doesn't he have any rights?

22:24.976 --> 22:27.570
Yes, he does,
but he's a juvenile.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.546
You can waive Miranda for him.

22:30.615 --> 22:31.809
I don't know.

22:33.885 --> 22:37.377
The Iast time you questioned
him, he was so upset, I...

22:39.958 --> 22:43.724
No, I think I should
talk to a Iawyer.

22:45.697 --> 22:49.155
Mrs. Rudd...
No, I can stand.
I don't need any help.

22:53.238 --> 22:55.035
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Level Thirteen,

22:55.107 --> 22:57.302
(ELECTRONIC VOICE SPEAKING)

22:59.344 --> 23:02.370
Game's over. Looks Iike
Dorothy's going to Iawyer up
the kid.

23:02.447 --> 23:04.210
How Iong have you been
playing that game?

23:04.282 --> 23:07.342
Your Captain's
found his calling.
He made it to the final Ievel.

23:07.419 --> 23:10.513
I defeated the Gorgon,
freed the forest
from evil demons,

23:10.589 --> 23:13.251
and rescued the dying princess
from her dungeon.

23:13.325 --> 23:14.383
Princess? Nice.

23:14.459 --> 23:16.859
Oh, wait till you hear
how he Iifted the spell
she was under.

23:16.928 --> 23:19.260
A sword
and a Iock of her hair.

23:20.599 --> 23:21.861
It gets better.

23:21.933 --> 23:23.901
I carried her
to the secret cave,

23:23.969 --> 23:27.370
I tied the hair to the sword
and placed it at the entrance.

23:27.439 --> 23:29.066
She's as good as new.

23:30.409 --> 23:35.745
So if we follow the game,
then GIenn killed Cassie
and then tried to save her?

23:36.148 --> 23:37.979
Killer's remorse?

23:38.049 --> 23:42.008
What doesn't track is GIenn
identified with the boy hero,
not the Gorgon.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.682
Wait, what exactly
is a Gorgon?

23:45.757 --> 23:47.918
Are you familiar with Medusa?

23:50.295 --> 23:52.354
GIenn's monster's a woman.

23:53.131 --> 23:54.462
MUNCH: Captain!

23:55.634 --> 23:59.161
That was Jane Rudd.
Guess who just
snatched her two other girls?

24:02.340 --> 24:05.070
I was in the kitchen
when Tanya got in from school,

24:05.143 --> 24:08.510
and she comes in and she says,
"Oh, Whitley,
it's time to go."

24:08.580 --> 24:10.480
And I said,
"Hey, go where, honey?"

24:10.549 --> 24:12.517
And that's when I saw them
standing in the doorway...

24:12.584 --> 24:14.779
Are you talking about
Tashandra and her boyfriend?

24:14.853 --> 24:17.788
His name was Duke.
I don't remember
his Iast name.

24:17.856 --> 24:21.121
That's okay, we do. Why don't
you have a seat, Jane?

24:21.193 --> 24:23.525
We already have people
covering their home
and their work.

24:23.595 --> 24:26.359
We've given out their
descriptions to every bus
and train station.

24:26.431 --> 24:27.921
Don't worry about it.
We're gonna find them.

24:27.999 --> 24:31.901
Did they say anything
that might tell us
where they were heading?

24:31.970 --> 24:36.168
AII she did was curse at me.
God, I wish my mother
had been here!

24:36.241 --> 24:37.469
They do this?

24:38.243 --> 24:39.767
Oh, God.
BENSON: Did they hurt you?

24:39.845 --> 24:43.212
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God.

24:43.281 --> 24:44.612

24:46.017 --> 24:47.279

24:49.921 --> 24:51.946
Great. We're on our way.

24:52.023 --> 24:54.321
Ticket agent at Port Authority
recognized the girls.

24:54.392 --> 24:56.360
They Ieft two minutes ago
on a bus to Atlanta.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.410
In the back on your right.

25:19.718 --> 25:22.585
Sir, come with me, please.

25:26.791 --> 25:28.315
I'm sorry, babe.

Come on.

25:36.735 --> 25:38.100
Tashandra...

25:38.169 --> 25:39.397
PIease just Iet us go.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.564
Just Iet us go, and I won't be
any more trouble to you,
I promise.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.301
You know that's not
the way it works.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.935
You can say
you didn't find us.

25:46.011 --> 25:50.345
I understand that you just
want your kids back, but this
is not the way to do it.

25:50.415 --> 25:53.407
Trust me,
this needs to end now.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.047
Let's go.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.214
Cassie was murdered.

25:58.290 --> 26:01.726
Did you just expect me to
sit by and Iet the same thing
happen to my other two?

26:01.793 --> 26:03.852
STABLER: That doesn't mitigate
what you did.

26:03.929 --> 26:06.489
Trespassing, assault,
kidnapping.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.658
BENSON: Minimum,
you're Iooking at
custodial interference.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.896
That's a felony.
I didn't have a choice.

26:11.970 --> 26:15.599
They were in danger. I had to
get them out of there.

26:15.674 --> 26:18.541
That woman murdered
my daughter.

26:18.610 --> 26:21.773
Mrs. Adams, I understand
that you're under
a Iot of pressure.

26:21.846 --> 26:23.336
Tanya told me.

26:26.718 --> 26:28.913
What did she tell you?
Not a Iot.

26:28.987 --> 26:32.445
But that's only because
that woman had her too scared.

26:32.524 --> 26:38.360
She finally Iet on that Cassie
got beaten all the time.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.329
By whom?

26:44.436 --> 26:45.835
Momma Rudd.

26:49.207 --> 26:52.472
We put them back with Jane.
May we see the file?

26:53.645 --> 26:59.743
You know, there are over
500,000 kids in foster care.

27:00.485 --> 27:03.113
It's not easy trying to find
a place for all of them.

27:03.188 --> 27:06.487
Do you realize that a serious
allegation has been made
against her?

27:06.558 --> 27:08.219
By Tashandra Adams.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.227
It's about the only thing
she hasn't tried.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.320
STABLER: What's this Ietter
from the BIuebell Agency?

27:12.397 --> 27:14.194
That was a reference check.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.495
Jane had two foster kids
before the Adams girls.

27:17.569 --> 27:20.333
This other agency removed
them. Two months Iater,
she came here.

27:20.405 --> 27:21.429
Why were they removed?

27:21.506 --> 27:26.739
Seems Jane "experienced
difficulty understanding
her role as a foster parent."

27:26.811 --> 27:27.835
What does that mean?

27:27.912 --> 27:30.073
The children were found
with soiled clothes.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.309
Jane missed appointments
with her case worker.

27:32.384 --> 27:33.442
But she was new.

27:33.518 --> 27:34.746
But the Ietter goes on to say,

27:34.819 --> 27:37.788
"We recommend that no more
children be placed with her."

27:37.856 --> 27:40.518
You felt comfortable
placing three Iittle girls
with this woman?

27:40.592 --> 27:43.459
We had her take
a parenting seminar.

27:45.764 --> 27:48.358
A seminar?
And she moved back
in with her mother.

27:48.433 --> 27:49.491
That was a provision.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.899
Dorothy Rudd
has a Iong history with us.

27:51.970 --> 27:54.200
Still, it was Jane's care
that you put them in.

27:54.272 --> 27:57.867
Believe me,
if the BIuebell Agency
had sensed any real danger,

27:57.942 --> 28:00.911
they would have taken steps
to have her decertified.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.082
GRANT: We worded that Ietter
very carefully.

28:08.153 --> 28:11.953
Phones call out, too. Did you
ever think of reporting Jane
to the state hotline?

28:12.023 --> 28:15.481
The violations we had evidence
of weren't that extreme.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.926
The woman's a hopper.
A what?

28:18.897 --> 28:23.800
The city contracts out to 73
private foster care agencies.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.392
We're not interlinked.

28:25.470 --> 28:29.668
When we turned her down,
she had 72 more chances.

28:29.741 --> 28:31.675
And you're sure she's unfit?

28:31.743 --> 28:34.041
Yeah, I've been
in this business 20 years.

28:34.112 --> 28:37.138
I interviewed Jane personally.
The woman's not stable.

28:37.449 --> 28:40.612
CABOT: We can't go after Jane
based on a case worker's
bad feeling.

28:40.685 --> 28:42.482
We have Tanya's
revised statement.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.419
Obtained after Tashandra
took them.

28:44.489 --> 28:47.219
They're tainted.
It'II never hold up.

28:47.292 --> 28:48.657
We haven't talked to
Dorothy yet.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.194
If she turned a blind eye
to the abuse,

28:50.261 --> 28:52.627
then she'II protect
the daughter
over the foster son.

28:52.697 --> 28:56.633
Then we gotta get to GIenn
now, before she gets
a Iawyer. AIex?

28:57.235 --> 28:59.203
There is king for a day.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.330
What, another video game?

29:01.406 --> 29:04.432
It's where we get
a Iaw guardian appointed
who will play ball.

29:04.509 --> 29:08.536
He'II Iet us talk to GIenn,
provided everything the boy
says is off the record.

29:08.613 --> 29:11.275
And any Iaw guardian
will do this?

29:11.349 --> 29:13.977
It might take a Iittle
sweet-talking.

29:18.890 --> 29:20.289
CRAGEN: Hey, GIenn.

29:21.025 --> 29:22.925
You know why I'm here?

29:24.796 --> 29:29.460
I heard you were the guy
to see about video games.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.829
You ever play Swordquest?

29:36.708 --> 29:38.232
That's my game.

29:38.309 --> 29:39.401
Mine, too.

29:39.911 --> 29:43.847
I made it to Ievel 13.
Bagged myself a Gorgon.

29:49.654 --> 29:51.485
I hate the Gorgon.

29:52.991 --> 29:56.051
Is that who took Cassie
to the cave that night?

29:56.127 --> 29:57.560
No.

29:58.263 --> 29:59.628
It was me.

30:00.732 --> 30:01.926
Why?

30:05.370 --> 30:06.928
To protect her.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.037
Who was hurting her?

30:14.145 --> 30:15.339
GIenn.

30:16.247 --> 30:21.048
It's my job to help kids
who have problems
with Gorgons.

30:22.187 --> 30:24.815
You have one in real Iife,
don't you?

30:30.528 --> 30:31.927
Who is it?

30:33.498 --> 30:39.459
You don't have to worry.
Remember? I'm a Ievel 13er.
She'II never get past me.

30:44.609 --> 30:46.304
What is it, GIenn?

30:47.779 --> 30:49.246
The Gorgon.

30:55.787 --> 30:57.618
What's going on here?

31:05.730 --> 31:09.166
I had no idea what a horrible
influence that video game was.

31:09.234 --> 31:11.725
FIN: Actually,
it's very educational.

31:11.803 --> 31:14.601
The monster in it is based on
Greek mythology.

31:14.672 --> 31:18.335
A Gorgon, one of three sister
monsters with snakes for hair

31:18.409 --> 31:20.934
and the ability to turn anyone
that Iooks at them into stone.

31:21.012 --> 31:22.741
Stones can't talk.

31:22.814 --> 31:25.282
Why would GIenn
call you a Gorgon?

31:25.850 --> 31:27.511
His imagination.

31:28.887 --> 31:33.085
If I'm guilty of anything,
it's of being too protective
of my children.

31:33.558 --> 31:34.616
Come again?

31:34.692 --> 31:38.458
I know I should have
turned GIenn in
when he first told me.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.359
But he's my son.

31:43.468 --> 31:44.901
You're a good mother.

31:44.969 --> 31:46.800
But if you want to help
your son,

31:46.871 --> 31:49.339
we have to know
the circumstances
that Ied up to it.

31:49.407 --> 31:53.571
You have to understand,
GIenn Iives in a world
of his own creation.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.205
FIN: In his mind,
he was rescuing Cassie.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.712
Yes.
MUNCH: From what?

31:58.783 --> 32:01.752
What was going on with Cassie
that he felt
she needed rescuing?

32:01.819 --> 32:06.654
Cassie is prone to violent
tantrums. She'd been
out of control for two days.

32:06.724 --> 32:08.521
Since seeing
her biological mom.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.857
When she came back
she was saying
horrible things.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.624
I couldn't get her to sleep.

32:12.697 --> 32:15.928
When I finally did,
she wet the bed.
Next day, more tantrums.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.992
With hypertension, that kind
of stress can't be good
for your blood pressure.

32:19.070 --> 32:23.029
I've taken in 12 children
over the Iast years.

32:24.842 --> 32:29.302
They all come damaged. Starved
for Iove and discipline.

32:29.380 --> 32:32.372
You had to discipline Cassie.
We can understand that.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.715
I had to send her
to the "time out" chair.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.448
MUNCH: Did you hit her?

32:38.022 --> 32:39.580
I spanked her.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.021
With what?
My hand.

32:43.528 --> 32:48.363
But poor GIenn
always wanted to rescue
a damsel in distress.

32:48.433 --> 32:51.129
He was, from being beaten
to death.

32:53.304 --> 32:57.673
It was GIenn who killed her.

32:58.176 --> 33:02.772
He must have really knocked
her around when he moved her
over to that house.

33:04.782 --> 33:06.545
That's what killed her.

33:06.851 --> 33:10.810
The thing is, Cassie had
rope burns on her wrists
and ankles.

33:11.956 --> 33:13.924
GIenn didn't tie her up.

33:17.795 --> 33:18.989
No.

33:20.565 --> 33:22.089
That was Jane.

33:23.968 --> 33:28.530
BENSON: Thirteen broken bones.
We know about
the "time out" chair.

33:29.507 --> 33:32.533
I told her to be good
or something bad would happen.
I told her.

33:32.610 --> 33:35.204
STABLER: She just wouldn't
Iisten.
No, she was so headstrong.

33:35.279 --> 33:38.442
She was always talking back.
She wouldn't do
as she was told.

33:38.516 --> 33:42.008
And, oh,
the incessant questions,
it'd get to anybody.

33:42.086 --> 33:44.020
So you tied her up.

33:44.088 --> 33:46.352
She couldn't even
fend off the blows.

33:46.491 --> 33:50.484
AII Cassie had to do
was be a good girl.
Is that too much to ask?

33:51.162 --> 33:53.187
Like you were
when you were Iittle?

33:53.264 --> 33:56.131
STABLER: What happened
when you weren't a good girl?

33:56.634 --> 33:58.898
She used to do the same things
to you, didn't she?

33:58.970 --> 34:02.337
Well, she wants the perfect
child, obedient and grateful.

34:02.407 --> 34:04.637
She won't accept
anything Iess.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.109
Jane, it's still not enough.

34:08.146 --> 34:10.205
She tried to pin
this whole thing on you.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.777
No, she didn't.
No, she didn't.

34:12.850 --> 34:14.283
BENSON:
Oh, Jane, yes, she did.

34:14.351 --> 34:18.413
We have a signed statement
saying you were the one
that tied Cassie up.

34:26.496 --> 34:28.726
My mother made me tie her up.

34:32.070 --> 34:36.166
Jane.
I never hit her, never.
Not once, ever.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.400
But you knew
what was gonna happen.

34:39.510 --> 34:42.070
How could you bring children
into that house?

34:42.146 --> 34:43.909
I didn't want to.
I didn't want kids.

34:43.981 --> 34:45.312
BENSON: Your mother
made you do that, too?

34:45.382 --> 34:48.045
No, she wanted to be
a grandmother.

34:48.886 --> 34:54.085
So you took in foster
grandbabies for her to abuse.

35:00.465 --> 35:02.399
Jane, what happened to Cassie?

35:03.901 --> 35:05.869
Cassie always fought her.

35:05.937 --> 35:10.306
Told her she hated her,
told her that
she was gonna tell.

35:11.843 --> 35:15.609
She said the beatings
were not gonna
keep her quiet anymore.

35:16.247 --> 35:18.647
So my mother

35:18.716 --> 35:20.980
beat her

35:21.052 --> 35:24.544
all day Iong.

35:32.396 --> 35:34.626
She used her cane, didn't she?

35:42.607 --> 35:46.737
Counselor,
I got some more ammunition
for you on the Rudd case.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.575
Warner says Dorothy's cane
matches the wound patterns,

35:49.647 --> 35:51.114
and we found the rope
in the apartment.

35:51.182 --> 35:52.877
Good. Jane just cut a deal.

35:52.950 --> 35:54.542
Well, not too cherry,
I hope.

35:54.619 --> 35:57.417
Five to ten,
conditional on her testimony
against her mother.

35:57.488 --> 36:00.321
She's an accessory,
so her testimony needs
to be corroborated.

36:00.391 --> 36:01.824
Well, you got GIenn.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.861
Who's currently
in a psych ward.

36:03.928 --> 36:06.089
Did you guys have any Iuck
tracking down
other foster kids?

36:06.164 --> 36:10.601
Benson and Stabler did
find one. Definitely abused.
He can't face Dorothy.

36:10.668 --> 36:14.126
Well, that's one down.
Dorothy's had a dozen
over the years.

36:14.205 --> 36:16.173
Who have scattered to
the four corners of the earth.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.936
Once they turn 18,
the system doesn't
want to know from them.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.672
Good night.
Hey, honest opinion.

36:21.746 --> 36:23.976
Can I put GIenn on the stand?

36:25.016 --> 36:26.142
Well, I talked to his doctors.

36:26.217 --> 36:30.847
He doesn't have any organic
mental illness, but I don't
think he's strong enough.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.787
What if I prep the hell
out of him?

36:33.724 --> 36:36.192
Unless you get this kid where
he feels completely safe,

36:36.260 --> 36:38.558
you'II be putting him
at further risk.

36:43.301 --> 36:44.825
That's where the judge
will be?

36:44.902 --> 36:45.994
Yeah.

36:48.673 --> 36:50.573
You want to try it out?

36:55.413 --> 36:58.314
Now, the courtroom
will be full of people
supporting you.

36:58.382 --> 37:01.818
There'II be your Iaw guardian,
and your friend,
Captain Cragen,

37:01.886 --> 37:04.753
and I will be at that chair
right there.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.521
Will my mom be here?

37:09.493 --> 37:11.256
Dorothy will be at that table
right there,

37:11.329 --> 37:14.059
but she can't talk to you
and she can't touch you.

37:14.131 --> 37:15.359
Are you sure?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.468
Do you remember
what the Court Officers do?

37:18.536 --> 37:20.299
Keep everybody safe.

37:21.339 --> 37:23.967
Now, the other attorney
is allowed to ask you
questions,

37:24.041 --> 37:26.305
but you just have to answer
them honestly, okay?

37:26.377 --> 37:27.674
Okay.

37:31.249 --> 37:35.447
You know, GIenn,
if this is too much for you

37:35.519 --> 37:38.852
or you decide you don't want
to do it, you don't have to.

37:39.991 --> 37:41.618
You understand?

37:41.692 --> 37:44.024
But it's to help Cassie,
right?

37:45.263 --> 37:46.594
Yeah.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.097
Then I want to do it.

37:55.906 --> 37:58.875
When did your mom put Cassie
in the yellow chair?

37:58.943 --> 38:00.433
Early in the morning.

38:00.511 --> 38:02.979
And why that chair
in particular?

38:03.047 --> 38:04.878
It's for punishment.

38:07.618 --> 38:09.745
What had Cassie done wrong?

38:11.122 --> 38:13.955
GIenn, what had Cassie
done wrong?

38:17.028 --> 38:18.859
She peed in her bed.

38:19.897 --> 38:21.296
What was her punishment?

38:21.365 --> 38:23.731
She had to drink
Iots and Iots of water.

38:23.801 --> 38:24.825
Until?

38:27.371 --> 38:28.736
She wet her pants.

38:29.607 --> 38:32.132
Was that the end
of her punishment?

38:37.214 --> 38:38.272
No.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.388
What happened next?

38:50.127 --> 38:54.086
She was begging for help.
I needed to save her.
She was...

38:55.266 --> 38:56.893
GIenn, just take your time.

38:56.967 --> 38:59.959
I needed to help her.
Cassie was hurt.

39:02.907 --> 39:06.070
Your Honor, I object to the
blatant ongoing intimidation
tactics by the defendant.

39:06.143 --> 39:08.407
I didn't do anything.
Liar!

39:10.414 --> 39:14.578
You beat her.
You beat her the whole day.

39:14.652 --> 39:17.815
I took you in when no one
else wanted you!

39:18.589 --> 39:21.080
Cassie was crying,
and you kept hitting her.

39:21.158 --> 39:24.855
She tried to run away
and you made Aunt Jane
tie her down.

39:25.596 --> 39:27.894
She was so Iittle.

39:28.899 --> 39:31.459
You were supposed
to protect her.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.134
But you beat her
with the cane all day.

39:37.975 --> 39:39.772
You killed her.

39:42.279 --> 39:44.042
You killed her.

39:55.292 --> 39:56.316
Who died?

39:57.828 --> 39:59.295
Dorothy Rudd.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.528
PIease tell me you're kidding.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.965
Just got a call from Rikers,
massive heart attack.

40:04.034 --> 40:05.831
Bitch didn't even suffer.

40:06.170 --> 40:07.933
CRAGEN:
Anybody else feel cheated?

40:08.005 --> 40:11.338
Prosecution abated by death.
It sucks.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.776
That's it. No vindication,
nobody pays.

40:14.845 --> 40:17.313
Jane'II do a couple of years.
SIap on the wrist.

40:17.381 --> 40:18.609
Her deal is done.

40:18.682 --> 40:19.979
What about the foster agency?

40:20.050 --> 40:22.382
They signed Cassie's
death warrant the day
they placed her there.

40:22.453 --> 40:24.284
No Iaws on the books
will Iet me prosecute them

40:24.355 --> 40:26.084
even if they knew
the house was unsafe.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.091
Tashandra Adams knew.
And you know
what bites the most?

40:28.159 --> 40:30.423
She still doesn't have
her kids back.

40:32.830 --> 40:35.060
Of course reunification
is our objective.

40:35.132 --> 40:38.431
But she hasn't
met the criteria
of her discharge plan yet.

40:38.502 --> 40:41.869
I checked. A Family Court
judge ruled that these kids
could be paroled to Tashandra

40:41.939 --> 40:43.463
as soon as she obtained
appropriate housing.

40:43.541 --> 40:45.065
Which she has not done yet.

40:45.142 --> 40:46.973
Part of your obligation
is to help her do that.

40:47.044 --> 40:48.807
I know what my job is.

40:48.879 --> 40:50.346
And I know mine.

40:50.414 --> 40:53.042
Enforcing criminal sanctions
against agencies Iike yours

40:53.117 --> 40:55.108
that knowingly place
their wards in unsafe homes.

40:55.186 --> 40:56.380
I had no idea.

40:56.454 --> 41:00.322
Well, the good people
at the BIuebell Agency
will testify that you did.

41:00.825 --> 41:03.385
If Ms. Adams does not get
her children back immediately,

41:03.461 --> 41:05.156
I will indict you
for child endangerment.

41:05.229 --> 41:06.491
That's blackmail.

41:06.564 --> 41:08.930
And if you drag your feet,
manslaughter.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.439
Momma.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.743
Don't cry. It's okay.

41:23.914 --> 41:27.077
Why don't we give them
a Iittle privacy?
Yeah.

41:28.152 --> 41:30.382
Can GIenn come Iive here, too?

41:32.556 --> 41:36.720
The boy that tried
to help Cassie,
what's gonna happen to him?

41:36.794 --> 41:39.422
He's in good hands. Bye.

41:44.101 --> 41:45.762
What is going to happen
to GIenn?

41:45.836 --> 41:47.997
Emergency foster placement.

41:48.072 --> 41:50.131
Right back in the system.
