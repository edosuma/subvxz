00:24.416 --> 00:27.666
According to astrophysicists,
nearly all of the gold on earth

00:27.750 --> 00:31.625
came here four billion years ago
during a meteor shower.

00:36.750 --> 00:40.333
Maybe the metal's violent arrival
caused it to be cursed forever.

00:45.333 --> 00:47.875
No other metal has caused as many murders…

00:50.666 --> 00:53.083
as the one we use to propose marriage.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.500
No other metal has caused so much pain.

01:22.208 --> 01:23.166
So much madness.

01:29.125 --> 01:30.875
Professor, open the door.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.083
-No!
-Professor, open the door!

01:33.166 --> 01:34.291
Leave me alone.

01:34.416 --> 01:37.166
What the fuck are you doing?

01:37.250 --> 01:38.291
What?

01:39.625 --> 01:42.583
Mónica, what are you doing? What's wrong?

01:42.666 --> 01:43.708
Leave her alone.

01:43.791 --> 01:46.458
Tokyo's dead. What are you laughing about?

01:47.291 --> 01:48.833
I shot up some morphine.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.333
What?

01:51.041 --> 01:55.458
I was just a name on the casualty list
where only the golden metal survives.

01:56.375 --> 02:00.125
Because while everything else decays,
gold remains intact.

02:03.791 --> 02:04.833
Tokyo is dead?

02:05.958 --> 02:06.958
Tokyo is dead.

02:08.166 --> 02:09.500
Tokyo is dead.

02:10.291 --> 02:11.666
Tokyo is dead?

02:15.250 --> 02:17.875
I just wanted the pain to go away, Denver.

02:18.375 --> 02:20.250
Honey…

02:21.875 --> 02:23.458
I love you.

02:38.416 --> 02:41.083
Professor, you need
to control your breathing.

02:41.583 --> 02:42.916
Come on, breathe.

02:44.458 --> 02:46.125
Hold your breath

02:46.208 --> 02:47.833
and count with me. One,

02:48.750 --> 02:52.208
two, three, four.

02:53.666 --> 02:54.833
And exhale.

02:56.625 --> 02:58.083
Again, Professor.

02:59.041 --> 03:00.208
Take a deep breath.

03:01.666 --> 03:02.708
Count.

03:03.208 --> 03:06.125
One, two, three…

03:07.583 --> 03:08.458
Colonel,

03:09.083 --> 03:11.458
we took down Silene Oliveira, AKA Tokyo.

03:12.166 --> 03:15.166
Fuck, finally, some good news.
Turn the speakers on.

03:15.958 --> 03:18.750
Gentlemen, we took down
one of the thieves.

03:23.291 --> 03:25.875
Oliveira resisted.

03:25.958 --> 03:28.125
Salvador Torrecilla, down.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.000
Lucas Hernando, down.

03:31.041 --> 03:32.500
Isaac Cobo, down.

03:33.875 --> 03:35.791
Mateo Canalejas, down.

03:37.708 --> 03:39.708
And César Gandía, down.

03:42.583 --> 03:45.458
Vázquez, injured. Arteche, minor injuries.

03:45.541 --> 03:46.666
And I am unharmed.

03:51.750 --> 03:52.666
I'm sorry.

03:52.750 --> 03:56.291
Your operation is hereby aborted.
Prepare to evacuate by air.

03:56.375 --> 03:57.250
No, Colonel.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.208
We are not going to withdraw.

04:00.291 --> 04:02.916
We came in here with the mission

04:03.000 --> 04:05.458
to end this heist
and that's what we're going to do.

04:05.541 --> 04:08.458
Sagasta, there's two of you
and one psycho.

04:11.208 --> 04:13.125
Right now, you don't stand a chance.

04:13.208 --> 04:14.416
More than ever,

04:15.208 --> 04:17.541
because this time
they really won't see it coming.

04:17.625 --> 04:21.291
So, Colonel,
do not launch any other operation.

04:21.375 --> 04:22.416
Over and out.

04:26.541 --> 04:30.625
-Are you sure you're okay?
-It's nothing. A loose shard.

04:31.208 --> 04:32.208
Give me your tag.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.416
Is anybody there?

04:42.500 --> 04:44.000
One of my men is injured.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.208
He needs to be evacuated.

04:48.041 --> 04:49.791
-And the rest?
-The rest are down.

04:49.875 --> 04:51.458
Just me and the injured are left.

04:55.208 --> 04:57.291
The soldiers want to negotiate.

04:57.375 --> 05:00.541
I repeat, they want to negotiate.
I request permission to do so.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.083
Feeling better?

05:17.541 --> 05:18.375
God.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.541
Professor, Sierra is running away.
She stole a car.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.541
Benjamín, you're in charge.

05:49.625 --> 05:51.041
Marseille, come with me.

05:56.583 --> 05:57.916
Fuck.

06:00.291 --> 06:01.625
Professor speaking.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.750
Private line with Palermo and Lisbon.

07:49.708 --> 07:53.833
BARENTS SEA, FIVE YEARS UNTIL D-DAY

07:57.416 --> 07:59.000
ALBERTO MENDOZA
INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER

08:17.583 --> 08:19.333
Look, there's the platform.

08:49.666 --> 08:53.000
The Bank of Spain adventure
began a long time ago,

08:53.083 --> 08:54.750
in a remote region of the planet.

08:55.458 --> 08:57.541
And like almost everything
in Berlin's life,

08:57.625 --> 09:02.125
it started with another robbery,
the most surreal he had ever done.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.041
Sir.

09:03.125 --> 09:06.750
Stealing the extraction pump
from an oil platform.

09:06.833 --> 09:08.333
That's where he met Bogotá.

09:08.416 --> 09:11.333
That's our man, Santiago,
underwater welder.

09:13.791 --> 09:16.625
He's been working on platforms
for over 20 years.

09:19.750 --> 09:22.333
Working for 20 years
and now you want to be a thief.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.208
With such rough hands.

09:26.375 --> 09:29.708
Yours are so soft
I could use them to jerk off.

09:30.875 --> 09:33.833
If you've been too scared
to leave this prison for 20 years,

09:33.916 --> 09:36.416
I can only think of one explanation.
You're a coward.

09:36.500 --> 09:39.375
And we can't run a heist with a coward.

09:42.458 --> 09:46.666
You think this sea is for cowards?
You've come here wearing your mom's coat!

09:46.750 --> 09:49.958
Let him go, unless you want to fly
like the cormorants.

09:56.750 --> 09:57.666
Hey.

09:58.583 --> 10:00.208
Why haven't you left?

10:00.291 --> 10:01.750
Because I have seven kids.

10:01.833 --> 10:05.000
Your wife's hips must be as worn out
as the wheel on a mill.

10:05.083 --> 10:09.541
Seven kids with seven different women.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.666
This guy is an endangered species.

10:16.416 --> 10:20.583
We're the only two true romantics left
and look where the other one was hiding.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.250
It's beautiful.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.041
Can it move 90 tons of gold?

10:36.541 --> 10:39.416
If any machine can do it, it's this one.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.958
It extracts aggregates from the seabed
as if they were baby food.

10:49.541 --> 10:50.583
Ladies!

10:51.583 --> 10:53.916
Things upstairs are pretty fucked up.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.666
I want the extraction pump connected
in two hours! Got it?

10:56.750 --> 10:57.666
Got it!

10:58.166 --> 11:00.166
We still have ten tons to melt.

11:00.875 --> 11:03.500
We'll keep melting
while we get the gold out.

11:03.583 --> 11:07.250
Come on! Today's the big day!
We'll be home for Christmas!

11:07.333 --> 11:09.541
-Come on!
-Let's do this!

11:18.666 --> 11:21.208
-Professor.
-Sierra took one of the cars.

11:21.291 --> 11:23.291
-What?
-But we're going after her.

11:23.791 --> 11:26.625
You let a woman
who just gave birth get away?

11:26.708 --> 11:29.458
Did you sing lullabies
thinking you were a happy family?

11:29.541 --> 11:30.916
What the hell happened?

11:31.500 --> 11:33.125
I lost my mind for moment.

11:33.208 --> 11:35.291
Sergio, listen to me.

11:36.291 --> 11:38.583
You take care of catching her.

11:38.666 --> 11:41.166
We'll stay here
and go ahead with the plan.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.791
Good luck, brother.

12:00.208 --> 12:03.291
Matías, come and help with the door.
We're going to negotiate.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.291
Open up.

12:05.041 --> 12:06.625
I have a gift for them.

12:08.166 --> 12:09.666
First, I'll blow them up.

12:10.166 --> 12:12.250
Then you can negotiate all you want.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.000
Put the gun down.

12:14.083 --> 12:14.958
No.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.958
Are you going to say
you're here because of me?

12:19.958 --> 12:21.916
I didn't ask you to rescue me.

12:22.666 --> 12:23.500
Give me that.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.500
Give me the gun.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.583
Give me the damn gun!
No one else is going to die here today!

12:36.666 --> 12:38.666
That… That is our problem.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.375
We want to be the good guys.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.458
In war, there are no good guys.

12:44.916 --> 12:46.291
Gandía killed Nairobi.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.791
And what did we do?

12:50.833 --> 12:52.833
Dress his wounds and get him out.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.166
And what did he do?

12:55.791 --> 12:57.666
He came back and killed Tokyo.

12:58.833 --> 13:01.000
Now we're going to heal their wounds, too?

13:01.083 --> 13:03.541
Why? So they can come back
and destroy us tomorrow?

13:05.041 --> 13:06.208
You know why?

13:06.916 --> 13:09.333
Because we didn't have the balls

13:09.416 --> 13:12.291
to kill people in cold blood
when we should have.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.250
We used to have Berlin.

13:15.916 --> 13:18.458
He took care of these things.
You knew him.

13:18.541 --> 13:20.666
What would he have done with Gandía?

13:21.791 --> 13:22.833
I'll tell you.

13:23.333 --> 13:24.833
He would've executed him…

13:26.875 --> 13:28.458
for killing Nairobi.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.750
Tokyo would still be alive.

13:37.625 --> 13:39.125
If it had been up to me,

13:39.208 --> 13:42.291
you'd be rotting
in the desert in Algeria right now.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.916
And Nairobi and Tokyo

13:46.000 --> 13:47.458
would still be alive.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.583
So would the six soldiers who just died.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.416
But here we are.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.625
And you're still alive.

13:58.583 --> 14:01.625
So don't fuck with me,
and try not to get anyone else killed.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.416
Matías, the door.

14:39.666 --> 14:41.916
Fuck, he's fucking everywhere!

14:42.000 --> 14:44.208
It's a safety feature.
You can't turn it off.

14:44.291 --> 14:47.083
We know where you are.
The car has geolocation.

14:47.166 --> 14:48.541
This chase is absurd.

14:48.625 --> 14:49.625
It sure is.

14:53.291 --> 14:55.375
If you escape, you'll go to jail.

14:55.458 --> 14:58.916
So, now you care if I go to jail
or are you trying to clear my name?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.208
It's too late for that.

15:01.916 --> 15:04.750
All Tamayo's done
is pour another shovelful of dirt on you.

15:04.833 --> 15:07.791
I'm up to my neck in dirt, just like you.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.875
You can't see it
because you think you're better than me.

15:10.958 --> 15:12.333
Of course I do.

15:12.416 --> 15:15.916
Tell that to Tokyo and Nairobi.
They're dead because of you.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.625
You discovered
where we were hiding Rio within hours.

15:18.708 --> 15:21.666
You could've done it months ago
instead of making a scene

15:21.750 --> 15:25.333
and risking so many lives,
but that would've been too easy

15:25.416 --> 15:27.875
for an ego as big as yours, right?

15:32.791 --> 15:34.666
You didn't give a shit about that kid.

15:34.750 --> 15:38.958
Or breakfast with crazy grandma
or walking on the beach with Paulita.

15:40.416 --> 15:43.416
It's great on vacation, but every day?
What a drag!

15:43.500 --> 15:46.041
One day you woke up,
looked in the mirror and said,

15:46.125 --> 15:47.375
"Should I buy a minivan

15:47.458 --> 15:51.708
or organize a goddamn heist
to get out of my fucking shitty life?"

15:53.458 --> 15:55.333
Am I right? Or am I right?

15:55.416 --> 15:56.291
What's wrong?

15:58.333 --> 15:59.250
Sorry, honey.

16:11.541 --> 16:12.916
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.875
You're going to spend the rest
of the heist tied up and gagged.

16:17.958 --> 16:19.041
You wish.

16:22.666 --> 16:25.333
I'm on the highway.
I'll cut her off from the front.

16:25.416 --> 16:26.416
Copy.

16:35.541 --> 16:39.541
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up horsey

16:41.500 --> 16:45.125
Giddy-up, giddy-up, go, go, go!

16:57.416 --> 17:01.458
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up horsey

17:01.541 --> 17:03.666
Giddy-up, giddy-up

17:03.750 --> 17:05.375
Giddy-up, giddy-up horsey

17:05.458 --> 17:07.750
Giddy-up, giddy-up, go, go, go!

17:09.125 --> 17:11.416
Giddy-up, giddy-up horsey…

17:11.500 --> 17:14.000
Marseille, move aside
or I'll run into you.

17:14.083 --> 17:15.291
I won't move.

17:16.916 --> 17:20.208
If you don't, you'll kill a mom and baby.
You're no murderer.

17:20.291 --> 17:22.125
-I saw how you held her.
-Stop the car.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.583
Don't act crazy, Alicia!

17:26.041 --> 17:28.625
I'm not acting crazy… I am crazy.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.541
Professor, my tires are flat.

17:46.583 --> 17:47.416
Professor!

17:48.750 --> 17:51.500
I can't right now, Marseille. I can't.

18:04.666 --> 18:05.791
Helsinki.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.750
Helsinki, how are you?

18:13.958 --> 18:16.500
If they had cut my leg off before,

18:17.000 --> 18:18.541
I'd be recovered by now.

18:19.833 --> 18:20.875
Stockholm…

18:25.166 --> 18:26.500
Who died?

18:29.833 --> 18:30.666
Tokyo.

18:34.375 --> 18:35.916
I heard four grenades.

18:36.708 --> 18:37.708
Who else?

18:39.666 --> 18:40.916
Six soldiers.

18:43.291 --> 18:44.708
It could've been worse.

18:44.791 --> 18:49.666
Denver and Manila could have died too
and you could've been widowed today.

18:51.875 --> 18:52.750
Yes.

19:01.916 --> 19:03.583
Zbogom, Tokyo.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.458
We should've attacked simultaneously
with several contingents.

19:17.541 --> 19:20.458
That's the way
things are done, contingent…

19:20.541 --> 19:21.375
Suárez!

19:26.000 --> 19:28.875
Tamayo, those five soldiers had children.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.041
Hernando, three kids.

19:31.125 --> 19:34.083
Canalejas, twin girls
who aren't even a year old.

19:34.166 --> 19:37.125
-Cobo, one kid and another on the way.
-What did you say?

19:37.208 --> 19:39.958
-That Cobo was expecting--
-Fuck, that's it.

19:40.041 --> 19:42.833
I want photos
of those soldiers with their kids,

19:43.375 --> 19:46.208
eating chocolate,
with their pets, on vacation…

19:46.291 --> 19:48.083
What are you talking about?

19:48.166 --> 19:50.291
Make it look like a Christmas movie!

19:50.375 --> 19:54.166
We have to show the world
those disfigured bodies, full of shrapnel.

19:54.250 --> 19:57.666
We're going to parade them around
like the corpse of Che Guevara.

19:57.750 --> 19:59.500
We'll bring everyone to tears.

19:59.583 --> 20:00.708
What are you doing?

20:00.791 --> 20:04.166
Do you want to turn their families' pain
into emotional porn?

20:04.250 --> 20:08.166
Those Robin Hoods took down
five national heroes

20:08.250 --> 20:10.916
and no one will cheer on
a bunch of murderers.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.541
We're going to turn the red tide
into an oil spill.

20:14.916 --> 20:18.541
Martínez, get Intelligence on the line,
information division.

20:18.625 --> 20:19.833
This is crazy.

20:45.125 --> 20:46.708
One wrong move and we open fire.

21:28.250 --> 21:30.916
Don't look for anyone. They're all dead.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.916
This is as far as you'll get.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.541
Let's see if he's telling the truth.

21:53.833 --> 21:55.666
Easy there, all right? Slow.

22:05.666 --> 22:07.375
She was wearing this one.

22:09.250 --> 22:10.458
It belongs to Cortés.

22:16.208 --> 22:17.916
So, what are your terms?

22:18.666 --> 22:22.500
My man needs a blood transfusion
and a surgeon. He leaves, I stay.

22:22.583 --> 22:24.791
I'll be your prisoner
until the heist is over.

22:25.375 --> 22:28.125
No. You stay, he stays
and a surgeon comes in.

22:33.375 --> 22:34.583
Colonel Tamayo,

22:34.666 --> 22:38.875
I need you to send a surgeon in
to treat Vázquez. They won't let us out.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.666
You can count on it.

22:41.250 --> 22:44.000
Hand me the radio.
Consider yourself my prisoner.

23:07.041 --> 23:08.000
Do you smoke?

23:08.083 --> 23:11.291
I quit nine months ago
for health reasons, but frankly,

23:12.375 --> 23:13.958
it's a bit contradictory.

23:20.750 --> 23:22.125
What happened in there?

23:22.875 --> 23:25.791
Oliveira pulled the pins on her grenades,

23:25.875 --> 23:27.708
then she let us take her down.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.791
When we went to finish her off,
her grenades exploded,

23:31.875 --> 23:34.375
and so did my men's, in sympathy.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.333
She wasn't one to give up easily.

23:37.875 --> 23:41.958
She would've made a great soldier…
if she had chosen the right side.

23:42.041 --> 23:44.208
You still think there's a right side?

23:44.291 --> 23:47.208
I think the world is full of bastards.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.125
Politicians are bastards.

23:52.666 --> 23:54.416
But dictators are worse.

23:55.333 --> 23:58.166
Us soldiers are also big fucking bastards.

23:58.250 --> 24:01.583
But terrorists like you are even worse.

24:02.083 --> 24:04.666
So, yeah, there are right sides.

24:05.416 --> 24:07.083
Don't you think it's ironic?

24:08.208 --> 24:10.833
That your violence is required
to keep the peace.

24:11.750 --> 24:16.291
Do you want me to believe that you're here
to fight for a better world?

24:18.791 --> 24:21.333
I'm here out of love
for a man and an idea.

24:21.833 --> 24:23.625
You loved your commando.

24:24.250 --> 24:26.708
We both knew this war was going to happen.

24:27.791 --> 24:30.166
And yet, we led them towards death.

24:32.083 --> 24:36.291
Maybe we did them a favor, I don't know.
Or condemned them to something worse.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.166
There are no right sides in hell, Major.

24:49.416 --> 24:52.875
They say that,
when someone dies tragically,

24:53.833 --> 24:56.791
their spirit lingers for a while
in the place they died.

24:58.916 --> 24:59.791
And sometimes,

25:00.500 --> 25:01.791
for a few seconds,

25:02.708 --> 25:05.125
the living can feel
the dead they once loved.

25:07.958 --> 25:09.083
And Rio felt it.

25:12.208 --> 25:13.916
I wanted to tell him it was me,

25:14.833 --> 25:16.583
that I hadn't fully left yet.

25:18.041 --> 25:19.083
That I was at peace.

25:20.541 --> 25:22.000
That I didn't suffer.

25:22.083 --> 25:23.291
And so much more.

25:26.333 --> 25:29.916
My mother came up with a trick for that.
It was a magic door.

25:31.375 --> 25:35.041
If I ever got scared, I could open it
and she'd be on the other side.

25:41.125 --> 25:43.375
This door will always be open for you.

25:43.958 --> 25:45.916
You can use it whenever you want.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.416
Thank you.

27:45.666 --> 27:46.625
Look at us.

27:49.041 --> 27:51.041
It's like we're in a scene from a movie.

27:51.125 --> 27:53.625
Aiming at each other in the rain,

27:53.708 --> 27:55.625
like in Liberty Valance.

28:00.125 --> 28:02.791
Has anyone ever challenged you to a duel?

28:04.708 --> 28:07.416
Rumor has it, the first to shoot
is more likely to survive.

28:07.500 --> 28:10.250
Don't force me to test that theory.
Put the gun down.

28:10.833 --> 28:13.375
Saving Rio was just an excuse.

28:14.333 --> 28:17.291
An excuse to rescue yourself
from your boring life.

28:18.541 --> 28:19.416
Right?

28:20.541 --> 28:23.291
I've lived most of my life
without an identity.

28:26.083 --> 28:28.541
Living in a hole like some ghost.

28:30.833 --> 28:33.708
My life with Raquel has been a dream.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.291
But I also have dreams of my own.

28:42.250 --> 28:45.375
And by kidnapping Rio,
you made it so easy.

28:45.458 --> 28:49.000
So you rescued the kid
to have a showdown with the State?

28:49.083 --> 28:50.666
Some people dream of skydiving.

28:51.666 --> 28:54.375
I didn't want to die
without robbing the Bank of Spain.

28:54.458 --> 28:58.500
You egocentric, narcissistic
son of a bitch. God, I love being right.

28:58.583 --> 29:00.125
Put it down or I'll shoot.

29:00.208 --> 29:01.250
No, you won't.

29:03.166 --> 29:05.000
Put the weapon down.

29:05.083 --> 29:08.125
You won't shoot.

29:08.208 --> 29:09.166
You won't shoot.

29:19.916 --> 29:22.458
You bastard. I didn't think you'd shoot.

29:23.416 --> 29:25.083
Good thing I emptied the clip.

29:28.916 --> 29:30.166
Now we're tied.

29:30.250 --> 29:33.083
We've both shot at each other,
both emptied our clips.

29:33.916 --> 29:35.125
Time for a tiebreaker?

29:35.708 --> 29:37.166
Should I shoot?

29:38.125 --> 29:39.916
What are we going to do?

29:53.083 --> 29:55.875
Tokyo died
because she was fed up with paradise.

29:56.666 --> 29:58.458
Because, one day, she woke up

29:59.833 --> 30:01.708
and was tired of paradise.

30:03.166 --> 30:05.166
And I get that.

30:07.083 --> 30:08.500
I had my paradise.

30:09.916 --> 30:12.291
I lived on the beach, far from the city,

30:12.375 --> 30:14.000
60 miles away.

30:15.166 --> 30:18.333
But every Friday,
I came up with a new excuse

30:18.416 --> 30:21.625
to go out partying
because I had to set myself on fire.

30:22.208 --> 30:23.958
I didn't grow up as much as I thought.

30:27.708 --> 30:30.208
Honey, we used to go out
every fucking day.

30:31.708 --> 30:33.500
We've grown up a little.

30:33.583 --> 30:35.375
I didn't fit into that life.

30:38.125 --> 30:39.541
And that makes me sad.

30:42.375 --> 30:45.666
You know what I reminisced about
in my paradise?

30:48.083 --> 30:49.000
About us.

30:50.416 --> 30:53.125
Us and how we were always
the last to leave the club.

30:53.208 --> 30:55.750
I called you early one morning
from a phone booth.

30:55.833 --> 30:57.625
It rang once and I hung up.

30:57.708 --> 30:59.916
You had a missed call
from Indonesia, right?

31:03.333 --> 31:05.416
I had a missed call from Indonesia

31:06.041 --> 31:08.250
at 1:15 in the morning.

31:08.750 --> 31:11.166
That was because of the time difference.

31:13.916 --> 31:17.791
Are you telling me that in paradise,

31:18.416 --> 31:20.500
on a fucking awesome remote beach,

31:21.500 --> 31:22.833
watching the sunrise,

31:24.041 --> 31:25.666
you thought about me, Dani?

31:26.458 --> 31:27.375
A lot.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.750
About Sundays
when they turned the lights on at the club

31:30.833 --> 31:33.083
and our feet were stuck to the floor?

31:34.333 --> 31:37.041
That's what you missed
while you were in paradise?

31:39.625 --> 31:40.791
Well,

31:41.833 --> 31:42.833
that sucks.

31:45.166 --> 31:47.666
Because now I don't know what to do.

31:50.083 --> 31:54.500
I swear I came here thinking,
"I'm going to go for it, I don't care."

31:54.583 --> 31:57.708
You can't waste your life
wanting to be with someone.

31:58.291 --> 32:01.708
But then I saw you, and I said, "No."

32:02.208 --> 32:04.333
"Stop, Julia. You better not."

32:05.708 --> 32:07.500
And now you tell me this and…

32:08.958 --> 32:10.375
I don't know what to do.

32:11.291 --> 32:14.875
You're putting this whole mess
and responsibility on me.

32:14.958 --> 32:16.416
What responsibility?

32:17.416 --> 32:18.583
Stepping aside.

32:30.833 --> 32:33.375
Denver, Manila, the surgeon is here.

32:33.458 --> 32:35.583
You have to take him to the wounded.

32:45.458 --> 32:47.166
-Denver.
-Coming.

32:47.916 --> 32:49.125
On my way.

32:50.208 --> 32:52.208
Hey, it's no big deal.

32:52.958 --> 32:54.166
No big deal.

32:55.500 --> 32:56.583
No big deal.

33:07.250 --> 33:09.500
Come on, Victoria. Let's go.

33:16.458 --> 33:19.208
Let me tell you something,
and as a mom this time.

33:19.875 --> 33:23.541
You were wrong to give up your life
in Thailand to steal a country's gold.

33:24.125 --> 33:25.208
You know why?

33:25.708 --> 33:29.541
Ultimately, what one misses
isn't the thrill of being a criminal.

33:30.083 --> 33:31.708
It's the comfort of family.

33:33.750 --> 33:34.916
Just so you know.

33:48.208 --> 33:51.416
Look. This is Emilio, my eldest.
He lives in Venezuela.

33:52.416 --> 33:55.375
This is Julián, he's in Mexico City.
He calls me "güey."

33:56.916 --> 34:00.500
Hanna, violinist. A beauty. In Finland.

34:01.083 --> 34:03.166
This is Drazen, he's in Montenegro.

34:03.250 --> 34:07.291
When I call to wish him a happy birthday
he says, "Thank you, sir."

34:07.375 --> 34:10.458
This is Ivana.
She's got a temper. She's an artist.

34:10.541 --> 34:14.125
A blonde one, a black one, a redhead…

34:14.208 --> 34:16.833
I'd say they all take after
their mom and dad,

34:16.916 --> 34:19.500
but I think they all take after their mom.

34:22.583 --> 34:23.708
Here comes the foreman.

34:42.166 --> 34:44.541
We've sabotaged this priceless pump

34:44.625 --> 34:46.416
to get it out of here.

34:46.500 --> 34:49.083
Tell him we're going to steal it from him.

35:00.916 --> 35:04.791
Tell him that we're also taking
this gentleman here with us.

35:04.875 --> 35:09.250
He spends so much time alone under water,
breathing a mix of oxygen and helium,

35:09.333 --> 35:11.583
that he's realized his wallet is full

35:11.666 --> 35:14.208
of photos of the 7 families he hasn't had.

35:14.291 --> 35:17.750
His kids call him "güey" and "sir"
because no one calls a stranger "Dad."

35:17.833 --> 35:20.041
That's why he wants
to get involved in our heist,

35:20.125 --> 35:23.541
to see if he can have a family
that isn't just in photos.

35:24.291 --> 35:27.000
By the way,
tell the foreman we charge 50% up front.

35:27.083 --> 35:30.750
He's going to have to pay us
to rob him. Translate, sir.

35:49.750 --> 35:52.541
This guy is awesome.
Ask him if he has a sister.

36:33.791 --> 36:36.625
Backpack on the conveyor belt.
Go that way. Move!

36:56.083 --> 36:56.958
Move.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.541
Double open fracture
of the radius and ulna.

37:06.041 --> 37:09.208
Bullet in the lower third of the leg,
no exit wound.

37:09.291 --> 37:12.041
Hemorrhage due to perforation
in the torso.

37:12.125 --> 37:14.041
All yours, doctor.

37:14.625 --> 37:16.750
This is the next man
you need to operate on.

37:18.041 --> 37:19.166
My leg is crushed.

37:19.250 --> 37:22.583
Femoral fracture and displaced patella.

37:23.083 --> 37:26.708
The tibia and fibula
are probably shattered as well,

37:26.791 --> 37:28.375
with femoral torsion.

37:29.125 --> 37:33.500
With a possible tear, not too big.
We controlled bleeding with compression.

37:33.583 --> 37:35.125
It's like a butcher shop.

37:35.208 --> 37:37.333
Surgery like bullfighter, doctor.

37:39.250 --> 37:40.291
But he goes first.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.541
Colonel, something's happening.

37:50.541 --> 37:55.083
They're sending information from the bank.
It is a real-time video, a live feed.

37:55.166 --> 37:56.708
Block it at all costs.

37:57.208 --> 37:59.583
I can't. I block one signal
and 100 more come up.

38:01.750 --> 38:03.833
Then I want to see it.
Put it on the screen.

38:04.791 --> 38:08.750
We're recording this video
to share some important information.

38:09.333 --> 38:12.000
Seven people died today

38:12.083 --> 38:13.916
inside the Bank of Spain.

38:15.333 --> 38:18.291
Six soldiers and Silene Oliveira,

38:19.416 --> 38:20.250
Tokyo.

38:22.916 --> 38:24.916
A few years ago,

38:25.416 --> 38:29.166
I thought Tokyo was one of those people

38:29.250 --> 38:32.375
who was unable to reflect
when they caused pain.

38:32.458 --> 38:35.625
I thought she was a murderer,
that she had no feelings.

38:35.708 --> 38:37.583
And then, I got to know her.

38:42.375 --> 38:44.666
I slapped her once.

38:46.416 --> 38:48.250
We were on a beach and…

38:49.166 --> 38:50.708
she didn't trust me

38:52.041 --> 38:53.833
and I thought that her plan

38:54.625 --> 38:56.416
to rescue Aníbal Cortés

38:58.083 --> 39:00.708
was nothing more
than the whim of a spoiled brat

39:01.208 --> 39:02.500
who feels guilty.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.458
I later realized

39:11.041 --> 39:12.708
she was doing it out of love.

39:19.125 --> 39:21.083
Very few people in this world

39:21.166 --> 39:25.833
are capable of braving the impossible
to save someone.

39:25.916 --> 39:26.958
Today, I know

39:27.958 --> 39:29.291
that we failed.

39:30.750 --> 39:33.791
I am pained by the loss of these lives.

39:33.875 --> 39:36.916
On behalf of all of us,
I ask for your forgiveness

39:37.500 --> 39:40.833
for having turned a rescue mission

39:42.875 --> 39:44.958
into a war with casualties.

39:45.875 --> 39:46.833
Starting today,

39:48.083 --> 39:50.458
we are no longer someone to follow,

39:51.333 --> 39:52.291
cheer on,

39:54.000 --> 39:55.583
and applaud.

40:01.208 --> 40:03.208
We're never getting out of here.

40:04.416 --> 40:07.375
So we ask that everyone
who believed in us,

40:07.458 --> 40:10.500
the great red tide supporting us
outside the bank,

40:12.250 --> 40:13.916
to please go home.

40:20.000 --> 40:26.166
We're not leaving!

40:26.750 --> 40:30.375
We're not leaving!

40:57.833 --> 41:02.000
We're not leaving!

41:02.083 --> 41:05.250
We're not leaving!

41:09.041 --> 41:13.333
That bitch has beaten us to it!
The first to talk defines the truth.

41:13.416 --> 41:16.166
If we tell our side
of this Christmas story,

41:16.250 --> 41:18.000
it won't be worth shit.

41:18.083 --> 41:22.041
That crybaby has beaten us
with her sentimental manipulation.

41:22.625 --> 41:24.166
With one small difference.

41:26.708 --> 41:28.458
Her feelings are real.

41:38.208 --> 41:39.583
Consuelo, what's wrong?

42:05.958 --> 42:07.708
The surgeon told me that

42:08.583 --> 42:09.750
Arturo is alive.

42:11.041 --> 42:11.875
That's great.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
I hit rock-bottom.

42:30.833 --> 42:32.458
I couldn't take it anymore.

42:33.625 --> 42:35.000
But I'm here, I'm back.

42:36.250 --> 42:37.875
-I don't know where--
-Wait.

42:37.958 --> 42:38.833
Yes.

42:46.125 --> 42:47.916
A little while ago, up there,

42:49.291 --> 42:50.875
you almost died.

42:53.666 --> 42:59.333
And I can't even begin to imagine what
it'd be like to live without you, Denver.

42:59.416 --> 43:00.333
I can't.

43:01.208 --> 43:03.583
It was a wake-up call.

43:08.833 --> 43:09.916
And I don't know.

43:10.708 --> 43:13.166
I don't know
if we'll get out of here alive, but…

43:15.958 --> 43:19.958
if something happens, Denver,
I don't want it to be when we're angry,

43:20.625 --> 43:23.291
or distant or doubtful,
because I have no doubts.

43:25.458 --> 43:26.458
I love you.

43:28.208 --> 43:29.541
I love you a lot, too.

43:30.250 --> 43:31.208
I know.

43:34.125 --> 43:36.666
Nothing could ever
be more important than that.

43:45.833 --> 43:46.750
Besides…

43:48.916 --> 43:52.875
we already know
it's possible to love during a heist.

43:54.208 --> 43:55.750
I fell in love during one.

44:21.291 --> 44:22.208
Consuelo?

44:24.875 --> 44:26.083
Consuelo, it's me.

44:41.958 --> 44:42.958
Consuelo?

44:55.166 --> 44:56.541
We've been waiting for you.

44:57.291 --> 44:59.250
I love your house.

45:00.083 --> 45:01.125
Are you okay?

45:03.250 --> 45:05.833
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-No swearing.

45:05.916 --> 45:10.083
At this age, they're like sponges.
I don't want you traumatizing her.

45:10.166 --> 45:12.833
So, good vibes, smile.

45:12.916 --> 45:15.625
Touch one hair on my wife's head
and I'll kill you.

45:15.708 --> 45:17.458
Are you really threatening me?

45:17.541 --> 45:19.958
The guy who didn't
send reinforcements into the bank

45:20.041 --> 45:22.708
because the Professor
had him by the balls?

45:22.791 --> 45:25.958
I don't know where you heard that,
but it's a lie.

45:26.041 --> 45:28.291
I was there, in his hideout,

45:28.375 --> 45:32.000
listening to him blackmail you
with a few recordings.

45:32.083 --> 45:34.416
We'd better talk about that in private.

45:34.500 --> 45:37.916
I'm sure your wife knows
just how despicable you are.

45:39.708 --> 45:40.625
Okay.

45:42.208 --> 45:43.791
Where is the Professor?

45:47.541 --> 45:48.583
Voilà!

45:50.458 --> 45:52.791
"What are you wearing, Colonel?"

45:54.166 --> 45:55.458
He's in my custody.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.791
I could put a ribbon on him
and hand him over.

46:17.125 --> 46:18.208
What do you want?

46:20.958 --> 46:22.375
Shut your fucking mouth.

46:38.625 --> 46:41.791
Retract all the lies you told about me.

46:42.375 --> 46:45.541
Resign from your position
and assume full responsibility.

46:45.625 --> 46:46.541
It's your duty.

46:48.708 --> 46:52.041
And then you hand the Professor
over on a silver platter.

46:52.791 --> 46:53.666
Like a hero.

46:59.625 --> 47:02.500
For your great service to the nation.

47:06.166 --> 47:08.958
What if I don't fucking feel like it?

47:13.250 --> 47:15.666
If you don't feel like it,
I'll pull a Raquel Murillo.

47:15.750 --> 47:18.833
I'll switch sides,
with all that it entails,

47:18.916 --> 47:21.208
and drink caipirinhas with the Professor.

47:35.083 --> 47:38.458
Assuming you have the Professor
and hand him over to me, which I doubt,

47:38.541 --> 47:41.375
do you think I'm going
to incriminate myself and go to jail

47:41.458 --> 47:43.708
just so this man doesn't get his way?

47:44.208 --> 47:45.166
No way.

47:45.250 --> 47:47.583
We're both better off free than in jail.

47:47.666 --> 47:51.208
Fuck, I've even started to like him.
It's a figure of speech, honey.

47:53.125 --> 47:55.166
The real dilemma is this.

47:56.375 --> 47:57.875
Either you shoot me now

47:57.958 --> 48:01.000
and don't get out of jail
until your son's balls are wrinkly…

48:01.083 --> 48:03.083
It's a girl, you asshole.

48:03.166 --> 48:05.875
…or give me the gun
and maybe you'll get a reduced sentence,

48:05.958 --> 48:10.125
because about three minutes ago
I hit the panic button on the alarm.

48:10.208 --> 48:13.416
The police are about
to come through that fucking door.

48:41.625 --> 48:42.875
3 LÓPEZ DE ORGAZ ST.

48:44.375 --> 48:45.250
LÓPEZ DE ORGAZ

48:45.333 --> 48:46.250
Tamayo.

49:17.916 --> 49:18.791
Who is it?

49:18.875 --> 49:22.416
Good afternoon. I have a certified letter
for apartment 5C.

49:22.500 --> 49:25.333
Could you buzz me in
so I can leave him the notice?

49:35.833 --> 49:36.875
Let's go.

49:39.666 --> 49:40.875
Let's go.

49:45.625 --> 49:47.625
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

49:58.750 --> 50:00.166
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

50:02.250 --> 50:05.500
I told you.
Now you have no choice but to trust me.

50:07.208 --> 50:09.208
-Let's go, quick!
-Hello?

50:09.291 --> 50:11.333
Can I leave the notice with you?

50:11.416 --> 50:12.375
Sure.

51:56.208 --> 51:59.125
