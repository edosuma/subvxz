WEBVTT

00:25.133 --> 00:26.834
>> John: HI THERE.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.033
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

00:28.100 --> 00:33.567
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID,

00:33.633 --> 00:34.567
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO ONE IN

00:34.633 --> 00:36.300
THE ROOM WITH THREE RIGHT NOW.

00:36.367 --> 00:38.166
ALTHOUGH INTERESTINGLY, THAT IS

00:38.233 --> 00:39.700
STILL SOMEHOW ONLY SLIGHTLY

00:39.767 --> 00:41.133
FEWER PEOPLE THAT WERE AT

00:41.200 --> 00:41.767
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OKLAHOMA RALLY

00:41.834 --> 00:44.100
LAST NIGHT, WHICH WAS HALF EMPTY

00:44.166 --> 00:46.166
DESPITE HIS CAMPAIGN CLAIMING A

00:46.233 --> 00:47.467
MILLION PEOPLE HAD REQUESTED

00:47.533 --> 00:49.333
TICKETS, AND EVEN BUILDING AN

00:49.400 --> 00:50.734
OUTDOOR STAGE SO HE'D BE ABLE TO

00:50.800 --> 00:51.834
DO A SECOND SPEECH TO THE

00:51.900 --> 00:53.467
THOUSANDS THAT COULDN'T GET IN.

00:53.533 --> 00:55.867
THAT SPEECH TURNED OUT TO BE

00:55.934 --> 00:56.533
VERY MUCH UNNECESSARY.

00:56.600 --> 01:00.166
SO FEW PEOPLE TURNED UP, IN

01:00.233 --> 01:01.133
FACT, THAT EVEN HE WAS TWEETING,

01:01.200 --> 01:06.266
I THINK I TOLD SOLD THAT PLACE

01:06.333 --> 01:06.667
OUT IN 20 MINUTES.

01:06.734 --> 01:10.667
IT'S NEVER A GREAT SIGN WHEN YOU

01:10.734 --> 01:15.266
ARE GETTING DUMPED ON BY HIM.

01:15.333 --> 01:16.333
BUT IT WAS ANOTHER BUSY WEEK,

01:16.367 --> 01:16.967
AS LARGE, PEACEFUL

01:17.033 --> 01:17.900
BLACK LIVES MATTERS PROTESTS

01:17.967 --> 01:18.734
CONTINUED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,

01:18.800 --> 01:19.734
THE OFFICERS WHO KILLED

01:19.800 --> 01:20.266
BREONNA TAYLOR WERE STILL

01:20.333 --> 01:21.100
NOT ARRESTED, AND JOHN BOLTON

01:21.166 --> 01:21.900
TRIED TO SELL FOR MONEY THE

01:21.967 --> 01:22.867
THINGS HE SHOULD'VE SAID FREELY

01:22.934 --> 01:23.533
BEFORE CONGRESS.

01:23.600 --> 01:24.467
ALSO, ON FRIDAY, IT WAS

01:24.533 --> 01:25.266
JUNETEENTH, WHICH A LARGE

01:25.333 --> 01:26.000
SEGMENT OF WHITE AMERICA BOTH

01:26.066 --> 01:26.700
CELEBRATED, AND LEARNED ABOUT

01:26.767 --> 01:30.300
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

01:30.367 --> 01:31.633
NOT ALL OF THE THE

01:31.700 --> 01:33.700
COMMEMORATIONS WERE APPROPRIATE,

01:33.767 --> 01:36.266
THOUGH.

01:36.333 --> 01:37.033
SNAPCHAT RELEASING

01:37.100 --> 01:37.867
A FILTER THAT ENABLED YOU TO

01:37.934 --> 01:39.066
BREAK CHAINS BY SMILING, WHICH

01:39.133 --> 01:42.033
THEY QUICKLY PULLED.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.800
AND THEN THERE WAS EVER THIS

01:44.867 --> 01:45.567
FUCK THIS IS.

01:45.633 --> 01:46.800
>> AS OUR COUNTRY WORKS THROUGH

01:46.867 --> 01:48.000
THE RACIAL ISSUES THAT WE STILL

01:48.066 --> 01:49.934
FACE TODAY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO

01:50.000 --> 01:51.166
REMEMBER WE ARE ONE GLOBAL

01:51.233 --> 01:53.367
COMMUNITY.

01:53.433 --> 01:57.934
LET'S ALL AGREE THAT

01:58.000 --> 01:59.300
ANY DIFFERENCES WE HAVE SHOULD

01:59.367 --> 02:00.333
BE CELEBRATED, AND LEARNED FROM.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.200
>> John: BEFORE YOU ASK: YES,

02:01.266 --> 02:02.867
THAT IS MELANIA TRUMP GIVING HER

02:02.934 --> 02:03.834
VERSION OF A JUNETEENTH ADDRESS.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.100
YES, SHE IS DOING IT BETWEEN TWO

02:05.166 --> 02:07.433
20-FOOT GOLDEN CANDELABRAS.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.734
NO, THE CAMERA DOESN'T PUNCH IN

02:08.800 --> 02:09.967
FOR A CLOSER SHOT, AND YES, I'M

02:10.033 --> 02:11.400
PRETTY SURE THIS DOES QUALIFY

02:11.467 --> 02:13.500
AS A HATE CRIME IN 12 STATES.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.867
BUT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THAT,

02:14.934 --> 02:16.767
LET'S MOVE ON.

02:16.834 --> 02:17.767
BECAUSE OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT

02:17.834 --> 02:19.400
CONCERNS THE CORONAVIRUS.

02:19.467 --> 02:20.800
YOU KNOW, THE THING YOU HAVE

02:20.867 --> 02:21.500
TO REGULARLY CONVINCE YOUR

02:21.567 --> 02:22.500
PARENTS STILL EXISTS.

02:22.567 --> 02:23.667
OH, YOU WENT TO A SHONEY'S,

02:23.734 --> 02:24.233
DID YOU?

02:24.333 --> 02:25.133
WHO ELSE WAS THERE?

02:25.200 --> 02:25.800
THE WHOLE TOWN?

02:25.867 --> 02:26.800
WOW.

02:26.867 --> 02:28.367
PLEASE STAY INSIDE, YOU

02:28.433 --> 02:30.400
EXTREMELY FRAGILE MANIACS.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.100
IN RECENT WEEKS, THERE'S BEEN

02:32.166 --> 02:33.533
A SERIES OF ALARMING SPIKES

02:33.600 --> 02:35.166
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

02:35.233 --> 02:36.967
BUT ONE PARTICULAR KIND OF PLACE

02:37.033 --> 02:37.867
HAS BEEN GETTING HIT ESPECIALLY

02:37.934 --> 02:38.734
HARD.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.367
>> PRISONS ARE SEEING

02:40.433 --> 02:41.300
AN ALARMING SPIKE.

02:41.367 --> 02:41.967
DATA COLLECTED BY

02:42.033 --> 02:44.500
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" SHOWS

02:44.567 --> 02:45.100
THE NUMBER OF INMATES INFECTED

02:45.166 --> 02:46.066
IS ABOVE 68,000.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.333
THAT'S DOUBLED OVER

02:47.400 --> 02:48.867
THE LAST MONTH.

02:48.934 --> 02:50.233
PRISON DEATHS TIED TO THE VIRUS

02:50.300 --> 02:51.300
HAVE RISEN BY 73% SINCE MID-MAY.

02:51.367 --> 02:53.700
THE FIVE LARGEST KNOWN CLUSTERS

02:53.767 --> 02:55.033
OF THE VIRUS ARE IN CORRECTIONAL

02:55.100 --> 02:57.300
INSTITUTIONS.

02:57.367 --> 02:59.433
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.100
THE FIVE LARGEST CLUSTERS OF

03:01.166 --> 03:02.333
CORONAVIRUS ARE IN CORRECTIONAL

03:02.400 --> 03:04.066
INSTITUTIONS.

03:04.133 --> 03:05.400
WHICH IS SO TERRIBLE, IT SOUNDS

03:05.467 --> 03:06.967
LIKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT PRODUCED

03:07.033 --> 03:07.633
BY SOME SORT OF BAD NEWS

03:07.700 --> 03:09.633
GENERATOR THAT SPITS OUT

03:09.700 --> 03:10.834
RANDOM SENTENCES LIKE,

03:10.900 --> 03:13.400
"CONFEDERATE STATUE INKS

03:13.467 --> 03:14.233
TEN-EPISODE DEAL WITH QUIBI," OR

03:14.300 --> 03:15.233
"TIKTOK HAMSTER CHARGED WITH

03:15.300 --> 03:16.300
FOUR COUNTS OF VEHICULAR

03:16.367 --> 03:17.700
MANSLAUGHTER," OR "SEAN HANNITY

03:17.767 --> 03:19.467
DATING AINSLEY EARHARDT."

03:19.533 --> 03:20.867
ONE OF THOSE IS REAL,

03:20.934 --> 03:22.533
AND IT'S THE WORST ONE.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.266
AND THE FACT THE CORONAVIRUS IS

03:24.333 --> 03:26.300
RAMPAGING THROUGH PRISONS AND

03:26.367 --> 03:27.967
JAILS IS ESPECIALLY ALARMING

03:28.033 --> 03:29.467
GIVEN THAT THERE ARE 2.2 MILLION

03:29.533 --> 03:30.533
PEOPLE BEING HELD IN THEM ACROSS

03:30.600 --> 03:32.033
THE COUNTRY.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.133
AND INMATES ARE GENERALLY A

03:33.200 --> 03:34.767
GROUP WITH HIGHER HEALTH RISKS.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.433
BETWEEN 1999 AND 2016,

03:36.500 --> 03:38.533
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 55 OR OLDER

03:38.600 --> 03:42.233
IN PRISON HAS INCREASED 280%,

03:42.300 --> 03:44.066
AND PEOPLE INSIDE JAILS ARE MORE

03:44.133 --> 03:45.667
LIKELY TO BE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED,

03:45.734 --> 03:47.433
WITH CHRONIC HEALTH ISSUES LIKE

03:47.500 --> 03:49.200
DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION.

03:49.266 --> 03:50.934
SO THIS IS AN IMMENSELY

03:51.000 --> 03:52.834
VULNERABLE POPULATION, AND

03:52.900 --> 03:53.967
INMATES VERY MUCH KNOW THAT,

03:54.033 --> 03:56.800
AS THIS ADVOCATE EXPLAINS.

03:56.867 --> 03:57.867
>> I PERSONALLY AM IN CONTACT

03:57.934 --> 03:59.433
WITH MORE THAN 300 PEOPLE WHO

03:59.500 --> 04:01.767
ARE INCARCERATED.

04:01.834 --> 04:02.700
THEY REPORT TO ME DAY IN AND

04:02.767 --> 04:03.533
NIGHT OUT.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.367
"LOUIS, THIS IS LIKE ME STANDING

04:06.433 --> 04:11.433
IN THE MIDDLE OF I-95 IN

04:11.500 --> 04:14.667
NEW YORK, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF

04:14.734 --> 04:15.700
THE ROAD, AND CARS ZIPPING BY ME

04:15.767 --> 04:16.834
AT 117 MILES AN HOUR IN BOTH

04:16.900 --> 04:18.033
DIRECTIONS.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.600
AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME

04:19.667 --> 04:21.000
BEFORE I'M HIT WITH THIS THING."

04:21.066 --> 04:23.333
>> John: YEAH, INMATES FEEL LIKE

04:23.400 --> 04:24.867
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME

04:24.934 --> 04:26.333
BEFORE THEY GET SICK, WHICH IS

04:26.400 --> 04:27.333
TERRIBLE, BECAUSE WE DON'T

04:27.400 --> 04:28.667
PUNISH PEOPLE BY GIVING THEM

04:28.734 --> 04:29.734
DISEASES.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.133
TAKE ME, FOR INSTANCE -- I DON'T

04:31.200 --> 04:32.600
HAVE LYME DISEASE BECAUSE OF MY

04:32.667 --> 04:33.567
2008 PUBLIC INTOXICATION CHARGE.

04:33.633 --> 04:35.066
NO.

04:35.133 --> 04:37.000
I HAVE IT BECAUSE THOSE DEER

04:37.066 --> 04:37.600
KNEW HOW TO FUCKIN' PARTY BACK

04:37.667 --> 04:41.400
THEN.

04:41.433 --> 04:43.233
I GOT TO BE HONEST, I MISS THAT

04:43.266 --> 04:43.734
CREW.

04:43.800 --> 04:44.700
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

04:44.767 --> 04:45.633
A FEW THINGS: WHY THE

04:45.700 --> 04:46.600
CORONAVIRUS HAS SPREAD SO

04:46.667 --> 04:47.533
RAPIDLY BEHIND BARS, THE IMPACT

04:47.600 --> 04:48.633
THAT HAS ON ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE,

04:48.700 --> 04:49.800
AND WHAT WE CAN, AND SHOULD,

04:49.867 --> 04:51.333
BE DOING ABOUT IT.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.900
AND JUST AS A QUICK REFRESHER:

04:52.967 --> 04:55.100
JAILS ARE WHERE PEOPLE ARE

04:55.166 --> 04:56.567
DETAINED WHILE AWAITING TRIAL OR

04:56.633 --> 04:57.600
HELD FOR MINOR SENTENCES,

04:57.667 --> 04:59.500
WHILE PRISONS TYPICALLY HOLD

04:59.567 --> 05:00.900
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN CONVICTED,

05:00.967 --> 05:01.867
AND ARE SERVING SENTENCES

05:01.934 --> 05:02.967
OF MORE THAN A YEAR.

05:03.033 --> 05:04.900
AND WHETHER YOU'RE IN A JAIL OR

05:04.967 --> 05:06.767
A PRISON, YOU'RE PROBABLY IN

05:06.834 --> 05:08.467
A FACILITY THAT IS IN NO WAY

05:08.533 --> 05:10.467
BUILT TO COPE WITH A CRISIS LIKE

05:10.533 --> 05:11.867
THIS, BECAUSE IT IS BASICALLY

05:11.934 --> 05:15.367
IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP SIX FEET

05:15.433 --> 05:16.133
APART IN A TINY CELL --

05:16.200 --> 05:16.967
AS TED KOPPEL FOUND OUT

05:17.033 --> 05:21.367
A FEW YEARS AGO.

05:21.433 --> 05:23.033
>> CONFINEMENT AND SOCIAL

05:23.100 --> 05:24.767
DISTANCING ARE MOSTLY

05:24.834 --> 05:25.834
INCOMPATIBLE.

05:25.900 --> 05:26.667
YOU DON'T HAVE A HELL OF

05:26.734 --> 05:28.000
A LOT OF ROOM TO MOVE IN HERE.

05:28.066 --> 05:28.633
>> I DON'T.

05:28.700 --> 05:29.266
YOU CAN ONLY -- IT'S LIKE, ONE

05:29.333 --> 05:30.400
PERSON CAN ONLY MOVE AT A TIME.

05:30.467 --> 05:31.166
LIKE IF I'M -- THIS IS -- WE HAD

05:31.266 --> 05:35.533
TO TURN SIDEWAYS.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.200
>> John: RIGHT.

05:36.266 --> 05:37.166
IT'S HARD TO

05:37.233 --> 05:38.233
PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING WHEN

05:38.300 --> 05:39.000
YOU LIVE IN WHAT'S BASICALLY

05:39.066 --> 05:39.800
A CLOSET WITH TWO BEDS AND

05:39.867 --> 05:40.633
A TOILET.

05:40.700 --> 05:41.667
IN FACT, I'D ARGUE YOU CAN'T

05:41.734 --> 05:42.934
PRACTICE MOST THINGS UNDER THOSE

05:43.000 --> 05:44.400
CIRCUMSTANCES, APART FROM GAMES

05:44.467 --> 05:45.166
LIKE "LET'S TRY NOT TO

05:45.233 --> 05:46.467
ACCIDENTALLY HUG EACH OTHER" AND

05:46.533 --> 05:48.300
"WHO CAN POOP THE QUIETEST?"

05:48.367 --> 05:49.934
AND INCIDENTALLY, THE CORRECT

05:50.000 --> 05:51.600
ANSWER TO THAT LAST QUESTION IS

05:51.667 --> 05:51.934
BLAKE LIVELY.

05:52.033 --> 05:54.800
SHE POOPS THE QUIETEST.

05:54.867 --> 05:55.967
THAT IS SIMPLY A FACT.

05:56.033 --> 05:56.867
AND SOME OF THE STEPS

05:56.934 --> 05:58.233
AUTHORITIES HAVE TAKEN TO DEAL

05:58.300 --> 05:59.333
WITH THIS PROBLEM ARE

05:59.400 --> 06:00.033
RIDICULOUSLY SMALL, AS THIS

06:00.100 --> 06:01.100
WORRIED MOTHER OF ONE PRISONER

06:01.166 --> 06:02.800
EXPLAINS.

06:02.867 --> 06:05.066
>> THEY'RE BEING LOCKED DOWN FOR

06:05.133 --> 06:07.500
LIKE, 23 AND A HALF HOURS A DAY.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.000
THEY GET TO COME OUT FOR, LIKE,

06:09.066 --> 06:13.734
10 MINUTES AND USE THE PHONE AND

06:13.800 --> 06:14.500
USE, YOU KNOW, TAKE A SHOWER

06:14.567 --> 06:15.300
AND THEN GO BACK IN.

06:15.367 --> 06:17.300
AND THOSE SMALL CELLS, THEY'RE

06:17.367 --> 06:18.033
TELLING THEM, SLEEP FROM HEAD

06:18.100 --> 06:18.667
TO FOOT.

06:18.734 --> 06:19.600
BUT, I MEAN, EVEN FROM HEAD TO

06:19.667 --> 06:20.567
FOOT, IF YOU'RE IN A SMALL CELL,

06:20.633 --> 06:24.900
IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

06:24.967 --> 06:25.333
>> John: EXACTLY.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.400
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT COMFORTING

06:26.467 --> 06:28.066
FOR A MOTHER TO HEAR, IS IT?

06:28.133 --> 06:29.033
"OH, DON'T WORRY, MA'AM, ALL

06:29.100 --> 06:29.900
PRISONERS ARE INSTRUCTED TO

06:29.967 --> 06:30.667
SLEEP HEAD TO FOOT, AND WHEN

06:30.734 --> 06:31.433
THEY'RE AWAKE, WE TELL THEM TO

06:31.500 --> 06:32.400
BREATHE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

06:32.467 --> 06:33.066
WE'RE PRETTY SURE WE'VE GOT THIS

06:33.133 --> 06:34.100
COVERED."

06:34.166 --> 06:34.967
THEN THERE'S THE SIMPLE ISSUE OF

06:35.033 --> 06:36.967
SOAP.

06:37.033 --> 06:38.600
AS EVERYONE KNOWS BY NOW,

06:38.667 --> 06:40.100
A KEY WAY TO PROTECT AGAINST

06:40.166 --> 06:41.400
THE CORONAVIRUS IS BY REGULARLY

06:41.467 --> 06:43.734
WASHING YOUR HANDS.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.066
BUT IN JAILS AND PRISONS,

06:45.133 --> 06:46.567
SOAP MAY BE RATIONED OR

06:46.633 --> 06:47.834
NOT AVAILABLE AT ALL.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.300
AND IF INMATES NEED MORE,

06:49.367 --> 06:50.533
THEY MAY HAVE TO BUY IT FROM

06:50.600 --> 06:51.967
THE COMMISSARY -- AND AS WE'VE

06:52.033 --> 06:53.400
COVERED BEFORE, DESPITE DOING

06:53.467 --> 06:55.233
MOST OF THE WORK TO KEEP PRISONS

06:55.300 --> 06:56.700
AND JAILS RUNNING, INMATES ONLY

06:56.767 --> 06:57.700
MAKE PENNIES FOR THEIR LABOR.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.700
IN FACT, SOME FACILITIES HAVE

06:59.767 --> 07:02.033
EVEN POSTED SIGNS ABOUT THE

07:02.100 --> 07:03.333
IMPORTANCE OF HAND-WASHING, BUT

07:03.400 --> 07:04.700
THEN CONTINUED TO CHARGE INMATES

07:04.767 --> 07:05.934
FOR ACCESS TO SOAP.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.400
AND MULTIPLE PRISONERS HAVE GONE

07:08.467 --> 07:10.066
OUT OF THEIR WAY TO TRY AND

07:10.133 --> 07:11.433
ALERT THE WORLD TO THIS

07:11.500 --> 07:13.567
DANGEROUS SHORTAGE.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.066
>> THIS IS WHAT THEY GAVE US,

07:15.133 --> 07:16.600
THIS LITTLE-ASS THING OF SOAP TO

07:16.667 --> 07:17.266
WASH -- TO STAY CLEAN, AND WASH

07:17.333 --> 07:18.934
OUR HANDS AND SHIT.

07:19.000 --> 07:19.834
AND THIS IS FOR EVERY TWO

07:19.900 --> 07:21.133
WEEKS.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.233
>> THEY ARE NOT GIVING US

07:22.300 --> 07:23.600
HAND SANITIZER.

07:23.667 --> 07:26.600
THEY ARE NOT GIVING US PROPER

07:26.667 --> 07:26.800
SOAP.

07:26.867 --> 07:27.967
>> THIS IS THE SOAP DISH THAT'S

07:28.033 --> 07:31.633
IN OUR BATHROOM.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.200
IT'S JUST PIECES OF SOAP THAT

07:33.266 --> 07:34.233
EVERYBODY GOT TO WASH THEIR

07:34.300 --> 07:34.767
HANDS WITH.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.834
WE HAVE TWO SOAP DISPENSERS BUT

07:36.900 --> 07:37.700
SOMETIMES ON A WEEKEND, THE SOAP

07:37.767 --> 07:41.900
RUNS OUT.

07:41.967 --> 07:43.133
>> John: THAT IS CLEARLY

07:43.200 --> 07:43.600
AWFUL.

07:43.667 --> 07:44.467
THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE ENOUGH

07:44.533 --> 07:45.967
SOAP.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.100
AND I KNOW, IF YOU WANTED TO DO

07:47.166 --> 07:48.567
A DECENT PARODY OF ME, YOU

07:48.633 --> 07:50.233
WOULDN'T BE TOO FAR OFF IF YOU

07:50.300 --> 07:51.734
SLAPPED ON A SUIT, FAKED A

07:51.800 --> 07:52.567
BRITISH ACCENT AND WENT AROUND

07:52.633 --> 07:53.500
SHRIEKING, "THERE SHOULD ALWAYS

07:53.567 --> 07:54.033
BE ENOUGH SOAP."

07:54.100 --> 07:57.100
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY

07:57.166 --> 07:57.800
LESS TRUE, DOES IT?

07:57.867 --> 07:58.934
THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE ENOUGH

07:59.000 --> 07:59.667
FUCKING SOAP!

07:59.734 --> 08:01.100
AND ESPECIALLY AT THAT LAST

08:01.166 --> 08:03.100
FACILITY, AT WHICH, AS OF APRIL,

08:03.166 --> 08:04.867
ABOUT 80% OF ITS RESIDENTS HAD

08:04.934 --> 08:07.166
CONTRACTED THE VIRUS.

08:07.233 --> 08:08.667
AND IT'S BY NO MEANS JUST

08:08.700 --> 08:09.834
CLEANING PRODUCTS THAT ARE

08:09.900 --> 08:12.266
SCARCE; PPE IS IN SUCH SHORT

08:12.333 --> 08:13.734
SUPPLY THAT IT'S LED TO

08:13.800 --> 08:16.166
PRISONERS WEARING SOCKS ON THEIR

08:16.233 --> 08:17.433
HANDS WHEN THEY USE THE PHONE --

08:17.500 --> 08:18.667
WHICH MIGHT BE THE SADDEST SOCK

08:18.734 --> 08:20.166
PUPPET EVER -- AND TESTING HAS

08:20.233 --> 08:21.266
BEEN SO LACKING THAT INMATES

08:21.333 --> 08:22.500
CAN'T BE CONFIDENT ABOUT WHO

08:22.567 --> 08:23.233
DOES, AND DOESN'T, HAVE THE

08:23.300 --> 08:24.600
VIRUS.

08:24.667 --> 08:26.200
AND ON TOP OF THAT, IF SOMEONE

08:26.266 --> 08:27.200
DOES SHOW SYMPTOMS, THEY'RE

08:27.266 --> 08:28.934
OFTEN PLACED IN SOLITARY

08:29.000 --> 08:30.433
CONFINEMENT, BECAUSE PRISONS

08:30.500 --> 08:31.467
HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO QUARANTINE

08:31.533 --> 08:32.500
THEM.

08:32.567 --> 08:34.700
AND IT'S NOT A GREAT INCENTIVE

08:34.767 --> 08:36.266
FOR INMATES TO COME FORWARD IF

08:36.333 --> 08:39.467
YOUR POLICY IS BASICALLY,

08:39.533 --> 08:40.633
"LOOK, JUST TELL US YOU'RE SICK,

08:40.700 --> 08:41.333
AND WE'LL PUT YOU IN THE SPECIAL

08:41.400 --> 08:43.934
PUNISHMENT HOLE."

08:44.000 --> 08:44.967
AND WHEN YOU TAKE ALL OF THIS

08:45.033 --> 08:45.633
TOGETHER -- THE CLOSE QUARTERS,

08:45.700 --> 08:46.567
THE LACK OF BASIC PROTECTIONS,

08:46.633 --> 08:47.967
AND THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE

08:48.033 --> 08:49.800
SPREAD OF A POTENTIALLY DEADLY

08:49.867 --> 08:50.767
VIRUS -- IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT

08:50.834 --> 08:51.667
TENSIONS CAN HIT A BREAKING

08:51.734 --> 08:53.333
POINT.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.200
>> ALL RIGHT, MAN, THIS IS WHAT

08:55.266 --> 08:55.867
HAPPENS WHEN THE CORONVAIRUS IS

08:55.934 --> 08:56.633
KILLING --

08:56.700 --> 08:59.100
>> JUST AFTER 3:00 THURSDAY

08:59.166 --> 09:00.867
AFTERNOON, AN INMATE TOOK

09:00.934 --> 09:01.934
CELLPHONE VIDEO INSIDE

09:02.000 --> 09:02.900
THE C-BLOCK OF THE LANSING

09:02.967 --> 09:04.734
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.600
PROPERTY DESTROYED, INMATES OUT

09:05.667 --> 09:09.000
OF THEIR CELLS.

09:09.066 --> 09:10.367
INMATES COMPLAINING OF

09:10.433 --> 09:13.066
CONDITIONS DUE TO COVID-19.

09:13.133 --> 09:14.567
>> Y'ALL DON'T WANT TO GIVE US

09:14.633 --> 09:17.066
NO HEALTHCARE?

09:17.133 --> 09:17.667
Y'ALL DON'T WANT TO GIVE US

09:17.734 --> 09:18.166
NO HEALTHCARE?

09:18.233 --> 09:19.233
THIS IS WHAT WE DO.

09:19.300 --> 09:20.433
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS GIVE US

09:20.500 --> 09:21.100
SOME MOTHERFUCKING HEALTHCARE.

09:21.166 --> 09:22.967
>> John: YEAH.

09:23.033 --> 09:24.633
AND IF ANYONE IS THINKING THAT'S

09:24.700 --> 09:27.500
AN EXTREME RESPONSE, I'D SIMPLY

09:27.567 --> 09:29.100
ASK THIS: WHAT ELSE ARE THEY

09:29.166 --> 09:30.066
SUPPOSED TO DO?

09:30.133 --> 09:30.967
WHAT OTHER BARGAINING CHIP DO

09:31.033 --> 09:31.633
PRISONERS HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL

09:31.700 --> 09:35.266
RIGHT NOW?

09:35.333 --> 09:36.900
THIS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN A BIT OF

09:36.967 --> 09:39.700
A RECURRING THEME LATELY, BUT

09:39.767 --> 09:41.033
I'LL SAY IT AGAIN:

09:41.100 --> 09:42.100
IF IT TAKES THE

09:42.166 --> 09:42.834
DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY FOR

09:42.900 --> 09:43.767
A SYSTEM TO PAY ATTENTION TO

09:43.834 --> 09:44.433
HUMAN LIVES, THEN WE ARE IN

09:44.500 --> 09:46.500
A DARK FUCKING PLACE.

09:46.567 --> 09:47.600
AND I KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE

09:47.667 --> 09:48.734
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE LITTLE

09:48.800 --> 09:49.500
TO NO FAMILIARITY WITH THE

09:49.567 --> 09:50.567
PRISON SYSTEM, IT CAN BE EASY TO

09:50.633 --> 09:52.000
IGNORE THIS PROBLEM, AND THAT

09:52.066 --> 09:52.900
ATTITUDE IS ACTUALLY REFLECTED

09:52.967 --> 09:54.000
BY SOME IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

09:54.066 --> 09:55.533
IN CALIFORNIA, WHEN AN OUTBREAK

09:55.600 --> 09:56.967
IN A SANTA BARBARA PRISON MADE

09:57.033 --> 09:58.700
IT DIFFICULT FOR THAT COUNTY TO

09:58.767 --> 10:00.133
MEET THE STATE'S STANDARDS FOR

10:00.200 --> 10:01.767
REOPENING, LOCAL OFFICIALS

10:01.834 --> 10:04.033
PROPOSED SIMPLY NOT COUNTING

10:04.100 --> 10:06.900
THE PRISONERS, WITH A COUNTY

10:06.967 --> 10:07.667
SPOKESMAN SAYING, "THE

10:07.734 --> 10:08.734
INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT OUT IN

10:08.800 --> 10:09.433
THE COMMUNITY, SO IT'S REALLY

10:09.500 --> 10:11.633
A WHOLE SEPARATE POPULATION."

10:11.700 --> 10:15.266
WHICH IS THE KIND OF THING YOU

10:15.333 --> 10:17.633
SHOULD REALLY ONLY REALLY BE

10:17.700 --> 10:18.433
SAYING IF THERE WAS A

10:18.500 --> 10:18.934
CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK

10:19.000 --> 10:20.834
IN ATLANTIS.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.700
"LOOK, THEY DON'T EVEN BREATHE

10:22.767 --> 10:23.667
AIR DOWN THERE!

10:23.734 --> 10:24.500
THEY'RE REALLY A SEPARATE

10:24.567 --> 10:25.033
POPULATION."

10:25.100 --> 10:26.233
AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE ARKANSAS

10:26.266 --> 10:26.867
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TRIED TO

10:26.900 --> 10:30.667
PUT AN EVEN MORE OPTIMISTIC SPIN

10:30.734 --> 10:31.367
ON THE PRISON OUTBREAKS THEY

10:31.433 --> 10:32.367
WERE HAVING THERE.

10:32.433 --> 10:33.266
>> THESE ARE HIGH-RISK SETTINGS

10:33.333 --> 10:34.900
WHERE COVID-19 CAN SPREAD VERY

10:34.967 --> 10:36.367
EASILY, VERY RAPIDLY.

10:36.433 --> 10:37.567
BUT THEY'RE ALSO CLOSED SYSTEMS

10:37.633 --> 10:39.633
AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

10:39.700 --> 10:40.967
REPRESENT THE SITUATION

10:41.033 --> 10:44.100
IN ARKANSAS IN GENERAL.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.233
A FORTUNATE THING ABOUT THAT

10:45.300 --> 10:47.934
KIND OF SETTING IS THAT IT'S --

10:48.000 --> 10:49.333
IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO CONTAIN IT

10:49.400 --> 10:50.600
BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T GOING OUT

10:50.667 --> 10:51.834
AND ABOUT.

10:51.900 --> 10:52.667
THEY'RE NOT -- THEY'RE NOT

10:52.734 --> 10:54.633
LEAVING THE PRISON.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.367
>> John: OKAY.

10:56.433 --> 10:59.166
EVEN IF PRISONS AND JAILS WERE

10:59.233 --> 11:00.333
CLOSED SYSTEMS -- WHICH THEY'RE

11:00.400 --> 11:01.600
VERY MUCH NOT, FOR REASONS WE'RE

11:01.667 --> 11:03.266
ABOUT TO GET INTO -- IT'S WEIRD

11:03.333 --> 11:04.633
TO CALL OUTBREAKS OF A DEADLY

11:04.700 --> 11:06.333
VIRUS "FORTUNATE," JUST BECAUSE

11:06.400 --> 11:07.834
THEY'RE CONFINED TO ONE PLACE.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.000
THE NEWS DIDN'T GO INSANE

11:09.066 --> 11:10.433
COVERING "BALLOON BOY" BECAUSE

11:10.500 --> 11:11.934
THEY WERE STOKED IT WAS JUST

11:12.000 --> 11:13.233
ONE BOY CONTAINED

11:13.300 --> 11:14.467
IN A HOMEMADE BALLOON CAREENING

11:14.533 --> 11:14.867
THROUGH THE SKY.

11:14.934 --> 11:16.934
NO, IT WAS TREATED AS AN

11:17.000 --> 11:17.967
EMERGENCY BECAUSE THERE WAS

11:18.033 --> 11:19.200
A CHANCE HE WAS GOING TO FUCKING

11:19.266 --> 11:20.500
DIE!

11:20.567 --> 11:21.734
THANKFULLY, OF COURSE, THERE

11:21.800 --> 11:23.066
TURNED OUT TO BE ZERO BOYS IN

11:23.133 --> 11:24.400
THAT BALLOON, AS IT WAS LATER

11:24.467 --> 11:25.333
REVEALED TO BE A HOAX PULLED OFF

11:25.400 --> 11:26.967
BY THE BOY'S PARENTS IN ORDER TO

11:27.033 --> 11:28.433
MAKE THE FAMILY, WHO HAD

11:28.500 --> 11:29.367
APPEARED ON THE REALITY SHOW

11:29.433 --> 11:30.000
"WIFE SWAP," MORE MARKETABLE TO

11:30.066 --> 11:31.333
THE MEDIA.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.700
AND HOLY SHIT, REMEMBER WHEN

11:32.767 --> 11:33.633
BALLOON BOY WAS THE CRAZIEST

11:33.700 --> 11:35.200
STORY YOU HAD TO WORRY ABOUT?

11:35.233 --> 11:39.967
2009 WAS A SIMPLER TIME.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.100
AND FOR THE RECORD: PEOPLE ARE

11:43.166 --> 11:45.367
ABSOLUTELY GOING OUT AND ABOUT

11:45.433 --> 11:46.867
FROM PRISONS, BECAUSE NOT

11:46.934 --> 11:48.066
EVERYONE IN A PRISON IS IN

11:48.133 --> 11:49.400
PRISON.

11:49.467 --> 11:51.700
THERE ARE AROUND 445,000

11:51.767 --> 11:53.433
NON-INMATE STAFF PERSONNEL

11:53.500 --> 11:55.233
WORKING IN PRISONS ACROSS

11:55.300 --> 11:56.967
THE COUNTRY, AND THOSE WORKERS

11:57.033 --> 11:57.867
HAVE REPORTED OVER 9,000

11:57.934 --> 11:59.300
CORONAVIRUS CASES.

11:59.367 --> 12:01.266
WE MIGHT AS WELL BE HANDING THEM

12:01.333 --> 12:02.834
CORONAVIRUS GIFT BAGS AS THEY

12:02.900 --> 12:03.700
LEAVE WORK EVERY DAY AND HEAD

12:03.767 --> 12:06.367
BACK OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY.

12:06.433 --> 12:08.467
AND STAFF BRINGING THE VIRUS IN

12:08.533 --> 12:10.033
AND OUT OF FACILITIES ISN'T THE

12:10.100 --> 12:11.700
ONLY WAY IT CAN SPREAD; IT CAN

12:11.767 --> 12:12.834
HOP FROM PRISON TO PRISON, AS

12:12.900 --> 12:14.300
INMATES ARE TRANSFERRED AROUND.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.500
AND IT CAN ALSO GET OUT INTO

12:15.567 --> 12:16.834
THE COMMUNITY WHEN SICK

12:16.900 --> 12:17.900
PRISONERS ARE TREATED AT LOCAL

12:17.967 --> 12:19.567
HOSPITALS -- PARTICULARLY IN

12:19.633 --> 12:21.433
RURAL AREAS, WHERE HOSPITALS CAN

12:21.500 --> 12:24.900
EASILY GET OVERWHELMED.

12:24.967 --> 12:25.900
AND THAT IS BEFORE WE GET INTO

12:25.967 --> 12:26.900
JAILS, WHERE THERE IS A CONSTANT

12:26.967 --> 12:28.033
CHURN OF PEOPLE MOVING IN AND

12:28.100 --> 12:29.567
OUT.

12:29.633 --> 12:31.834
IN A TYPICAL WEEK, MORE THAN

12:31.900 --> 12:33.633
200,000 PEOPLE ARE BOOKED INTO

12:33.700 --> 12:35.467
JAILS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND

12:35.533 --> 12:37.834
ANOTHER 200,000 WALK OUT.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.533
SO OUTBREAKS IN PRISONS AND

12:39.600 --> 12:40.900
JAILS CAN EASILY SPREAD

12:40.967 --> 12:42.800
TO THE LARGER COMMUNITY.

12:42.867 --> 12:44.233
IN FACT, ONE STUDY SUGGESTED

12:44.266 --> 12:45.967
THAT, AS OF MID-APRIL, MORE THAN

12:46.033 --> 12:48.834
15% OF ALL DOCUMENTED

12:48.900 --> 12:50.567
CORONAVIRUS CASES IN ILLINOIS

12:50.633 --> 12:51.967
COULD BE LINKED TO JUST ONE

12:52.033 --> 12:53.200
FACILITY -- THE COOK COUNTY

12:53.266 --> 12:54.467
JAIL.

12:54.533 --> 12:56.033
AND WHILE THE JAIL STRONGLY

12:56.100 --> 12:57.300
DISPUTES THOSE FINDINGS,

12:57.367 --> 12:58.667
THERE WERE ACTIVISTS WHO SAW

12:58.734 --> 12:59.667
THE DANGER SIGNS EARLY ON, LIKE

12:59.734 --> 13:01.433
THIS MAN, WHO WAS WARNING PEOPLE

13:01.500 --> 13:03.467
BACK IN MARCH.

13:03.533 --> 13:06.166
>> AS OF RIGHT NOW, COOK COUNTY

13:06.233 --> 13:08.633
JAIL IS A VIRTUAL PETRI DISH.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.900
COOK COUNTY SHERIFF TOM DART,

13:10.967 --> 13:12.033
HE IS THE CAPTAIN OF A DEATH

13:12.100 --> 13:13.967
CRUISE SHIP.

13:14.033 --> 13:15.166
>> John: WOW, A "DEATH CRUISE

13:15.233 --> 13:17.133
SHIP."

13:17.200 --> 13:18.567
LOOK, CRUISE SHIPS ARE ALREADY

13:18.633 --> 13:20.033
COMFORTABLY BAD ENOUGH WITHOUT

13:20.100 --> 13:20.867
BRINGING DEATH INTO THE

13:20.934 --> 13:21.867
EQUATION.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.133
IT'S LIKE IF OUR PARENT COMPANY

13:23.200 --> 13:24.533
REBRANDED THEMSELVES

13:24.600 --> 13:27.867
AS "GENOCIDE AT&T."

13:27.934 --> 13:29.300
GUYS, GUYS, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU

13:29.367 --> 13:30.967
COULD POSSIBLY MAKE A WORSE

13:31.033 --> 13:34.934
EXPERIENCE THAN THE ONE YOU'RE

13:35.000 --> 13:35.900
ALREADY PROVIDING PEOPLE.

13:35.967 --> 13:37.133
THE POINT IS, CORONAVIRUS

13:37.200 --> 13:38.266
DOESN'T STAY BEHIND BARS.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.633
IT TRAVELS EASILY.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.400
WHICH ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO OUR

13:41.467 --> 13:42.900
FINAL QUESTION: WHAT CAN WE DO?

13:42.967 --> 13:44.333
WELL, REALISTICALLY, WE NEED TO

13:44.400 --> 13:45.266
BE GETTING AS MANY PEOPLE OUT OF

13:45.333 --> 13:47.934
PRISONS AND JAILS AS POSSIBLE.

13:48.000 --> 13:48.633
WHICH IS, FRANKLY, SOMETHING WE

13:48.700 --> 13:49.533
SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.333
BUT RIGHT NOW, WE REALLY DON'T

13:50.400 --> 13:51.400
HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE.

13:51.467 --> 13:52.800
THE FEWER PEOPLE IN THESE

13:52.867 --> 13:53.867
FACILITIES, THE EASIER IT WILL

13:53.967 --> 13:55.500
BE FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO SOCIALLY

13:55.567 --> 13:57.367
DISTANCE, THE FEWER STAFF YOU'LL

13:57.433 --> 13:58.934
NEED ON SITE, AND THE LOWER YOUR

13:59.000 --> 14:00.200
DEMAND FOR PPE.

14:00.266 --> 14:02.000
BUT OF COURSE, WHENEVER ANYONE

14:02.066 --> 14:03.133
SUGGESTS RELEASING INMATES,

14:03.200 --> 14:07.000
THIS IS THE INEVITABLE RESPONSE.

14:07.066 --> 14:08.600
>> THE PUBLIC JUST DOESN'T WANT

14:08.667 --> 14:10.600
TO HAVE A THOUSAND BURGLARS,

14:10.667 --> 14:13.367
THIEVES, AND, YOU KNOW, IDENTITY

14:13.433 --> 14:14.233
FORGERS AND OTHERS OUT ON THE

14:14.300 --> 14:16.166
STREET.

14:16.233 --> 14:18.233
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS

14:18.300 --> 14:19.367
WATCHING OUR HOMES, AND

14:19.433 --> 14:20.300
BUSINESSES, PURSES,

14:20.367 --> 14:20.834
AND WALLETS RIGHT NOW.

14:20.900 --> 14:21.867
WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE OF THIS.

14:21.934 --> 14:23.800
>> John: ALL RIGHT.

14:23.867 --> 14:25.100
FIRST OFF, TAXIDERMIED

14:25.166 --> 14:26.400
GEORGE LUCAS, YOU SEEM TO BE

14:26.467 --> 14:29.500
STRUGGLING TO THINK OF MORE THAN

14:29.567 --> 14:30.333
ONE KIND OF CRIMINAL THERE.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.166
BURGLAR, THIEF, IDENTITY FORGER

14:31.233 --> 14:32.567
-- THOSE ARE ALL JUST SYNONYMS

14:32.633 --> 14:33.233
FOR STEALING!

14:33.300 --> 14:35.800
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER

14:35.867 --> 14:37.500
CRIMINALS IN TEXAS, LIKE THE MAN

14:37.567 --> 14:38.834
WHO POSED AS A BETO O'ROURKE

14:38.900 --> 14:41.066
VOLUNTEER, BROKE INTO SOMEONE'S

14:41.133 --> 14:42.633
HOME, AND TOOK A POPSICLE, OR

14:42.700 --> 14:44.066
THE MAN WHO WAS FORCED TO RETURN

14:44.133 --> 14:45.033
$3,000 IN PRIZE MONEY FOR

14:45.100 --> 14:46.567
CHEATING IN BASS FISHING

14:46.633 --> 14:48.133
CONTESTS, OR EVEN THE WOMAN WHO

14:48.200 --> 14:49.533
DRANK WINE OUT OF A PRINGLES CAN

14:49.600 --> 14:50.600
WHILE DRIVING AN ELECTRIC CART

14:50.667 --> 14:51.533
AROUND A WALMART PARKING LOT FOR

14:51.600 --> 14:54.266
SEVERAL HOURS?

14:54.333 --> 14:56.400
TEXAS HAS A VIBRANT CRIME SCENE,

14:56.467 --> 14:57.300
WITH A LOT MORE VARIETY THAN

14:57.367 --> 14:58.100
YOU'RE FRANKLY GIVING IT CREDIT

14:58.166 --> 14:59.400
FOR.

14:59.467 --> 15:01.133
AND I'D ARGUE THAT THERE ARE

15:01.200 --> 15:02.767
SOME PEOPLE WE HAVE NO EXCUSE

15:02.834 --> 15:05.667
FOR NOT RELEASING IMMEDIATELY.

15:05.734 --> 15:07.433
ESPECIALLY THOSE AWAITING TRIAL

15:07.500 --> 15:08.800
IN JAIL WHO POSE LITTLE RISK TO

15:08.867 --> 15:10.166
PUBLIC SAFETY, AND ARE ONLY

15:10.233 --> 15:11.667
THERE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T

15:11.734 --> 15:12.633
AFFORD TO POST BAIL.

15:12.700 --> 15:15.800
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THAT

15:15.867 --> 15:16.800
EVERY PERSON WHO'S LET OUT DUE

15:16.867 --> 15:17.867
TO THE CORONAVIRUS WILL BEHAVE

15:17.934 --> 15:19.633
PERFECTLY.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.567
NO ONE CAN SAY THAT.

15:21.633 --> 15:23.000
AND I'M SURE THAT YOU'LL SEE

15:23.066 --> 15:24.834
PEOPLE ON TV EXCITEDLY CITING

15:24.900 --> 15:28.166
ISOLATED CASES OF PEOPLE WHO

15:28.233 --> 15:32.467
WERE RELEASED AND THEN DID BAD

15:32.533 --> 15:33.533
YOU'LL SEE THAT ON SHOWS LIKE

15:33.600 --> 15:34.834
"CRIME PORN FOR OLD WHITES WITH

15:34.900 --> 15:35.734
LAURA INGRAHAM," OR

15:35.800 --> 15:36.934
"THEY'RE COMING FOR YOU

15:37.000 --> 15:38.667
WITH A HUMAN SQUASH COURT."

15:38.734 --> 15:39.767
BUT ON BALANCE, THE RISK OF

15:39.834 --> 15:46.600
CAREFULLY LETTING PEOPLE OUT

15:46.667 --> 15:49.200
ARE VASTLY OUTWEIGHED

15:49.266 --> 15:50.333
BY THE RISK OF

15:50.400 --> 15:51.200
LEAVING EVERYONE INSIDE.

15:51.266 --> 15:52.800
AS FOR PRISONS, THE BARE MINIMUM

15:52.867 --> 15:53.667
WE SHOULD DO IS RELEASE

15:53.734 --> 15:54.367
OFFENDERS WHO'VE SERVED

15:54.433 --> 15:55.333
THE MAJORITY OF THEIR SENTENCES,

15:55.400 --> 15:56.166
PARTICULARLY

15:56.233 --> 15:57.133
THE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED AND

15:57.200 --> 15:58.000
THE ELDERLY.

15:58.066 --> 15:58.834
THOSE GROUPS ARE AT HIGH RISK

15:58.900 --> 16:00.066
FOR THE VIRUS, AND THE ELDERLY

16:00.133 --> 16:01.100
ARE ALSO A VERY LOW RISK TO

16:01.166 --> 16:01.700
REOFFEND.

16:01.767 --> 16:02.767
YOU COULD ALSO PLACE CERTAIN

16:02.834 --> 16:03.233
PRISONERS ON FURLOUGH,

16:03.300 --> 16:04.333
BASICALLY PAUSING THEIR SENTENCE

16:04.400 --> 16:05.633
AND HAVING THEM RETURN TO FINISH

16:05.700 --> 16:06.433
IT ONCE THE PANDEMIC IS UNDER

16:06.500 --> 16:07.633
CONTROL, OR YOU CAN PLACE THEM

16:07.700 --> 16:08.967
UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

16:09.033 --> 16:14.233
AND AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL,

16:14.300 --> 16:14.834
TO HIS -- AND I CANNOT BELIEVE

16:14.900 --> 16:15.467
I'M GOING TO SAY THIS -- CREDIT,

16:15.533 --> 16:16.867
ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR RELEASED

16:16.934 --> 16:17.633
A DOJ MEMO INSTRUCTING

16:17.700 --> 16:18.333
FEDERAL PRISONS TO REDUCE

16:18.400 --> 16:22.233
THEIR POPULATIONS.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.100
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA,

16:24.166 --> 16:24.600
IN THEORY.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.100
BUT TO DATE, THEY'VE ONLY DONE

16:26.166 --> 16:27.533
THAT BY AROUND 3%.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.934
WHICH IS EVEN WORSE THAN

16:29.000 --> 16:30.133
THE TYPICAL STATE PRISON,

16:30.200 --> 16:30.934
BECAUSE THEY'VE REDUCED THEIR

16:31.000 --> 16:33.400
POPULATION BY JUST 5%.

16:33.467 --> 16:35.233
AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.934
AND I KNOW THIS MIGHT PUT YOU IN

16:37.000 --> 16:38.433
THE UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION OF

16:38.500 --> 16:43.734
HAVING TO ARGUE ON BEHALF OF

16:43.800 --> 16:44.567
PEOPLE THAT YOU MIGHT NOT FIND

16:44.633 --> 16:45.300
INHERENTLY SYMPATHETIC.

16:45.367 --> 16:46.200
TAKE THE CASE OF ONE FEDERAL

16:46.266 --> 16:46.900
PRISONER WHO PUSHED HARD TO BE

16:46.967 --> 16:47.500
RELEASED.

16:47.567 --> 16:48.500
>> A JUDGE HAS REJECTED

16:48.567 --> 16:50.166
CONVICTED PHARMACEUTICAL

16:50.233 --> 16:52.200
EXECUTIVE MARTIN SHKRELI REQUEST

16:52.266 --> 16:53.033
TO BE LET OUT OF PRISON TO

16:53.100 --> 16:54.100
RESEARCH A CORONAVIRUS

16:54.166 --> 16:57.467
TREATMENT.

16:57.533 --> 16:59.000
THE PRESIDING JUDGE NOTED THAT

16:59.066 --> 17:00.567
PROBATION OFFICIALS VIEWED THAT

17:00.633 --> 17:03.400
CLAIM AS THE TYPE OF

17:03.467 --> 17:05.066
"DELUSIONAL" BEHAVIOR THAT LED

17:05.133 --> 17:06.100
TO HIS CONVICTION IN THE FIRST

17:06.166 --> 17:07.200
PLACE.

17:07.266 --> 17:08.767
>> John: YEAH, MARTIN SHKRELI,

17:08.834 --> 17:09.734
THE "PHARMA BRO," TRIED TO GET

17:09.800 --> 17:10.700
RELEASED TO HOME ARREST SO HE

17:10.767 --> 17:11.800
COULD "WORK ON DEVELOPING A CURE

17:11.867 --> 17:13.300
FOR THE CORONAVIRUS."

17:13.367 --> 17:15.133
PRESUMABLY SO HE COULD CALL IT

17:15.200 --> 17:16.467
"RONA JUICE" AND SELL IT FOR

17:16.533 --> 17:17.834
5,000% MORE THAN IT SHOULD COST.

17:17.900 --> 17:21.133
AND HE WAS DENIED.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.600
AND WHEN YOU MIGHT HEAR THAT,

17:22.667 --> 17:23.967
YOU MIGHT THINK, "GOOD,

17:24.033 --> 17:26.333
FUCK THAT GUY."

17:26.400 --> 17:27.133
AND GENERALLY -- YEAH, FUCK THAT

17:27.200 --> 17:27.734
GUY.

17:27.800 --> 17:28.867
BUT IN THIS INSTANCE, DESPITE

17:28.934 --> 17:30.033
THE FACT MARTIN SHKRELI IS AN

17:30.100 --> 17:30.800
ATTENTION-STARVED TREE FROG WHO

17:30.867 --> 17:32.667
CLEARLY WASN'T HELD ENOUGH AS A

17:32.734 --> 17:33.900
TADPOLE, AND DESPITE HIS

17:33.967 --> 17:35.266
REASONING FOR WHY HE SHOULD BE

17:35.333 --> 17:36.166
RELEASED BEING COMPLETE

17:36.233 --> 17:39.767
BULLSHIT, I DON'T WANT HIM TO

17:39.834 --> 17:40.333
CONTRACT THE VIRUS AND

17:40.400 --> 17:41.166
POTENTIALLY DIE FROM IT.

17:41.233 --> 17:43.066
I DON'T WANT THAT FOR ANYONE.

17:43.133 --> 17:44.233
NONE OF US SHOULD.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.367
AND YET RIGHT NOW, MILLIONS OF

17:46.433 --> 17:48.467
AMERICANS ARE CURRENTLY STUCK

17:48.533 --> 17:49.800
IN TRULY DESPERATE STRAITS,

17:49.867 --> 17:50.934
AND VASTLY DISPROPORTIONATELY

17:51.000 --> 17:53.500
PEOPLE OF COLOR.

17:53.567 --> 17:57.300
AND SOME PRISONERS HAVE BECOME

17:57.367 --> 17:58.133
SO DESPERATE, THEY WILL RISK

17:58.200 --> 17:58.934
PUNISHMENT TO TRY AND GET ANYONE

17:59.000 --> 18:00.100
IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD TO PAY

18:00.166 --> 18:01.500
ATTENTION TO THEIR SITUATION.

18:01.567 --> 18:03.066
JUST WATCH THIS PRISONER OPENLY

18:03.133 --> 18:04.433
USING A CONTRABAND CELL PHONE --

18:04.500 --> 18:05.400
WHICH HE KNOWS WILL LEAD TO

18:05.467 --> 18:06.667
CONSEQUENCES -- TRYING TO RAISE

18:06.734 --> 18:07.767
AN ALARM.

18:07.834 --> 18:08.800
>> THIS MOTHERFUCKER OVER HERE

18:08.867 --> 18:09.834
DYING FROM CORONA.

18:09.900 --> 18:10.500
THEY GOT THIS MOTHERFUCKER

18:10.567 --> 18:11.834
IN MY ROOM.

18:11.900 --> 18:12.600
THEY'RE LITERALLY LEAVING US

18:12.667 --> 18:14.433
IN HERE TO DIE.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.834
>> THIS IS AARON CAMPBELL.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.400
HE'S AN INMATE AT FCI ELKTON,

18:18.467 --> 18:19.333
A LOW-SECURITY FEDERAL PRISON IN

18:19.400 --> 18:20.433
OHIO.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.867
HE'S USING A CONTRABAND

18:21.934 --> 18:24.233
CELLPHONE, AND HE KNOWS HE'S

18:24.300 --> 18:25.100
GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE FOR

18:25.166 --> 18:26.200
MAKING THIS VIDEO.

18:26.266 --> 18:31.200
>> I WAS LIKE, FUCK IT,

18:31.266 --> 18:32.333
TRYING TO KEEP THIS PHONE

18:32.400 --> 18:33.166
SITUATION LOW KEY, BUT, LIKE,

18:33.233 --> 18:34.066
THIS SHIT'S SERIOUS AS FUCK.

18:34.133 --> 18:34.934
EVERYBODY IN THIS BITCH IS

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
DYING, AND WHAT DO YOU WANT ME

18:36.066 --> 18:36.900
TO DO, DIE IN THIS BITCH?

18:36.967 --> 18:42.633
>> John: NO.

18:42.700 --> 18:43.767
I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT THAT.

18:43.834 --> 18:44.533
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU: THE

18:44.600 --> 18:45.266
AUTHORITIES AT THAT PRISON HAVE

18:45.333 --> 18:47.700
SAID THAT THE MEN IN THAT VIDEO

18:47.767 --> 18:49.100
WERE ACTUALLY COMPLETELY FINE,

18:49.166 --> 18:49.834
AND NEITHER WERE SICK.

18:49.900 --> 18:50.467
ALTHOUGH YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW

18:50.533 --> 18:51.467
THAT BY THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN

18:51.533 --> 18:52.633
COUNT, AT THAT ONE LOW-SECURITY

18:52.700 --> 18:54.400
INSTITUTION, MORE THAN 600

18:54.467 --> 18:55.967
INMATES HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR

18:56.033 --> 18:57.834
CORONAVIRUS, AND NINE HAVE DIED.

18:57.900 --> 18:58.967
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW THAT

18:59.033 --> 19:00.367
PRISONER IS DOING, HE'S

19:00.433 --> 19:01.900
REPORTEDLY BEEN IN SOLITARY

19:01.967 --> 19:03.767
SINCE THAT VIDEO WENT VIRAL

19:03.834 --> 19:05.200
IN EARLY APRIL, AND HE WROTE

19:05.266 --> 19:06.500
A LETTER TO REPORTERS SAYING

19:06.567 --> 19:07.667
THAT OFFICIALS TOLD HIM

19:07.734 --> 19:08.834
HE WOULDN'T FACE ADDITIONAL

19:08.900 --> 19:10.400
DISCIPLINE IF HE ISSUED

19:10.467 --> 19:11.233
A STATEMENT SAYING THE VIDEO

19:11.300 --> 19:14.033
WAS FAKE.

19:14.100 --> 19:14.800
A REQUEST HE THEN REFUSED.

19:14.867 --> 19:15.900
WHICH IS INCREDIBLY BRAVE.

19:15.967 --> 19:17.133
AND THAT'S COMING FROM ME,

19:17.200 --> 19:18.333
A MAN WHO HAS NEVER MISSED AN

19:18.400 --> 19:19.367
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY "I'M SORRY"

19:19.433 --> 19:21.567
FOR LITERALLY ANYTHING.

19:21.633 --> 19:23.834
SO AT THIS POINT, IT'S WORTH

19:23.900 --> 19:24.700
ASKING: WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE

19:24.767 --> 19:26.066
DOING HERE?

19:26.133 --> 19:27.133
PARTICULARLY DURING THIS

19:27.200 --> 19:28.700
PANDEMIC, BUT ALSO IN GENERAL.

19:28.767 --> 19:30.000
BECAUSE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A MUCH

19:30.066 --> 19:32.100
LARGER DISCUSSION TO BE HAD

19:32.166 --> 19:32.967
ABOUT HOW MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

19:33.033 --> 19:34.233
ENDED UP INCARCERATED IN THE

19:34.300 --> 19:35.200
FIRST PLACE, AND WHETHER OR NOT

19:35.266 --> 19:36.300
PRISONS EVEN WORK.

19:36.367 --> 19:37.967
WHICH I'D ARGUE, THEY ABSOLUTELY

19:38.033 --> 19:39.467
DO, IF YOUR ONLY GOAL IS TO HAVE

19:39.533 --> 19:41.800
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN PRISON.

19:41.867 --> 19:45.433
THE FACT IS, WE SHOULD BE

19:45.500 --> 19:49.200
DEPOPULATING PRISONS AND JAILS

19:49.266 --> 19:50.934
AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN RIGHT NOW.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.233
AND I KNOW HOW THAT SOUNDS

19:52.300 --> 19:52.967
BECAUSE WE WERE ALL RAISED

19:53.033 --> 19:53.633
HEARING THAT YOU SHOULDN'T DO

19:53.700 --> 19:54.700
THE CRIME IF YOU CAN'T DO THE

19:54.767 --> 19:55.300
TIME.

19:55.367 --> 19:56.600
BUT IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM,

19:56.667 --> 19:57.600
YOU'RE NEVER JUST BEING

19:57.667 --> 19:58.767
SENTENCED TO TIME.

19:58.867 --> 20:00.633
YOU'RE BEING SENTENCED TO

20:00.700 --> 20:01.467
A LIFETIME OF SOCIAL STIGMA,

20:01.533 --> 20:02.767
FUTILE JOB INTERVIEWS,

20:02.834 --> 20:04.433
AND ROADBLOCKS TO NECESSITIES

20:04.500 --> 20:06.100
LIKE HOUSING.

20:06.166 --> 20:09.166
ALL OF THAT IS IMMORAL ENOUGH --

20:09.233 --> 20:10.367
THERE IS NO REASON WE SHOULD NOW

20:10.433 --> 20:11.033
ALSO BE SENTENCING PEOPLE TO DIE

20:11.100 --> 20:14.300
FROM A VIRUS.

20:14.367 --> 20:15.266
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT JUSTICE,

20:15.333 --> 20:16.000
IT'S NEGLECT.

20:16.066 --> 20:17.367
AND IT REALLY MATTERS.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.066
BECAUSE AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE TO

20:19.133 --> 20:20.333
PRETEND THAT INCARCERATED PEOPLE

20:20.400 --> 20:21.066
ARE A "SEPARATE POPULATION,"

20:21.133 --> 20:23.500
THEY'RE NOT.

20:23.567 --> 20:24.934
WHATEVER THEY'VE DONE, THEY ARE

20:25.000 --> 20:26.400
STILL MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY.

20:26.467 --> 20:29.467
AND IF THIS HORRIFIC YEAR HAS

20:29.533 --> 20:30.800
TAUGHT US ONE THING, IT'S THAT

20:30.867 --> 20:32.200
WE ARE ALL ON THIS DEATH CRUISE

20:32.266 --> 20:33.567
SHIP TOGETHER.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.967
AND NOW THIS.

20:36.033 --> 20:40.867
>> Announcer: AND NOW...

20:40.934 --> 20:42.100
A FATHER'S DAY TRIBUTE TO THE

20:42.166 --> 20:44.800
WORLD'S GREATEST DAD.

20:44.867 --> 20:46.200
>> WITH FATHER'S DAY COMING UP,

20:46.266 --> 20:47.600
WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO

20:47.667 --> 20:49.367
SIT WITH THE MOST POWERFUL

20:49.433 --> 20:50.567
FATHER IN THE WORLD.

20:50.633 --> 20:51.967
>> OVER THE YEARS, I'VE TOLD YOU

20:52.033 --> 20:53.200
THINGS THAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT

20:53.266 --> 20:54.800
YOU, AND I TOLD YOU THINGS I

20:54.867 --> 20:56.467
DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT YOU.

20:56.533 --> 20:57.066
I'VE TOLD YOU THINGS THAT YOU

20:57.133 --> 20:58.367
HAD TO STRAIGHTEN OUT AND YOU

20:58.433 --> 20:59.533
KNOW I WAS VERY STRONG.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.533
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THAT A BIG,

21:01.600 --> 21:02.533
PUBLIC LINK SO I WON'T MENTION

21:02.600 --> 21:02.900
AT.

21:02.967 --> 21:04.367
>> THAT IS MORE PERSONAL.

21:04.433 --> 21:06.600
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

21:06.667 --> 21:07.166
BUSINESS SIDE.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.600
>> WE DON'T NEED TO BE REMINDED

21:08.667 --> 21:09.767
THAT HIS HIM AND EVERYBODY ELSE.

21:09.834 --> 21:12.400
>> I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER HIM.

21:12.467 --> 21:14.200
I FEEL IT'S TRITE TO CALL HIM

21:14.266 --> 21:14.700
AND SAY HELLO.

21:14.767 --> 21:15.333
DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?

21:15.400 --> 21:17.433
>> WHAT IS OF EVERYTHING YOU

21:17.500 --> 21:19.633
HAVE IN COMMON WITH YOUR FATHER?

21:19.700 --> 21:22.233
>> EITHER REAL ESTATE OR GOLF.

21:22.300 --> 21:23.166
>> DONALD, WITH YOUR DAUGHTER?

21:23.233 --> 21:30.600
>> WELL, I WAS GOING TO SAY SEX.

21:30.667 --> 21:32.033
>> WHAT DOES TIFFANY HAVE A VIEW

21:32.100 --> 21:32.900
AND WHAT IS TIFFANY HAVE OF

21:32.967 --> 21:34.166
MOMS?

21:34.233 --> 21:38.667
>> SHE'S GOT HER LEGS.

21:38.734 --> 21:42.333
DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT SHE'S

21:42.400 --> 21:42.767
GOT THIS PART.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.633
>> I'M NOT GOING TO BE DOING THE

21:44.700 --> 21:45.934
DIAPERS, NOT GOING TO MAKE THE

21:46.000 --> 21:47.600
FOOD, I MAY NEVER EVEN SEE THE

21:47.667 --> 21:47.800
KIDS.

21:47.867 --> 21:49.066
>> THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY FOR

21:49.133 --> 21:51.300
BOTH OF YOU IS YOU HAVE TO KEEP

21:51.367 --> 21:51.800
FOCUSED.

21:51.867 --> 21:53.200
AND YOU ARE NOT ALWAYS FOCUSED

21:53.266 --> 21:54.200
BUT A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH

21:54.266 --> 21:56.533
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE BOTH VERY

21:56.600 --> 21:56.734
YOUNG.

21:56.767 --> 21:57.934
>> THANK YOU.

21:58.000 --> 21:58.900
>> THANK YOU.

21:58.967 --> 22:00.667
>> YOU COULD STAY BEHIND AND ASK

22:00.734 --> 22:01.200
A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS

22:01.266 --> 22:02.967
WITHOUT ME HERE IF YOU WANTED

22:03.033 --> 22:03.400
TO.

22:03.467 --> 22:04.934
I SEE THAT'S -- YOU KNOW, THAT

22:05.000 --> 22:06.400
SOMETHING A LOT OF THE BIG

22:06.467 --> 22:07.567
ANCHORS DO.

22:07.633 --> 22:08.533
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, AND THEN

22:08.600 --> 22:09.433
THEY WILL SIT IN THE CHAIR AND

22:09.500 --> 22:11.533
WE ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BUT

22:11.600 --> 22:12.133
I THINK YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

22:17.467 --> 22:19.100
>> John: MOVING ON.

22:19.166 --> 22:20.834
BEFORE WE GO TONIGHT, WE JUST

22:20.900 --> 22:21.900
WANTED TO SAY A QUICK WORD ABOUT

22:21.967 --> 22:23.367
SOCIAL MEDIA, THE SERVICE THAT

22:23.433 --> 22:24.867
FORCES THE QUESTION, "IS THIS

22:24.934 --> 22:25.633
CELEBRITY TRENDING FOR BEING TOO

22:25.700 --> 22:26.800
HORNY, TOO RACIST, OR TOO DEAD?"

22:26.867 --> 22:28.667
SOMETIMES IT'S TWO OUT OF THREE,

22:28.734 --> 22:29.867
BUT WHICH TWO MIGHT SURPRISE

22:29.934 --> 22:33.367
YOU.

22:33.433 --> 22:33.934
HEATHCLIFF THE CAT

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
DIED REFRESHINGLY NOT RACIST

22:35.066 --> 22:37.233
BUT INCREDIBLY HORNY.

22:37.300 --> 22:38.834
BUT SPECIFICALLY, I'D LIKE TO

22:38.900 --> 22:40.033
TALK TO YOU ABOUT FANCAMS.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.133
AND IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH

22:41.200 --> 22:42.000
WHAT THEY ARE, DON'T FEEL BAD,

22:42.066 --> 22:43.166
SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE OLD.

22:43.233 --> 22:45.200
BUT VERY BASICALLY, FANCAMS ARE

22:45.266 --> 22:47.166
SHORT MONTAGES OF A PERFORMER

22:47.233 --> 22:48.967
THAT YOU LIKE, SET TO MUSIC.

22:49.033 --> 22:50.133
ANYONE CAN BE FANCAMMED, AND I

22:50.200 --> 22:51.834
DO MEAN ANYONE.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.367
HERE'S A REAL ONE WE FOUND.

22:53.433 --> 22:54.633

23:08.467 --> 23:09.767
THE RIGHT NUMBER OF LIKES FOR

23:09.834 --> 23:11.066
A VIDEO OF MY FACE AND BODY IS,

23:11.133 --> 23:12.100
BUT I DO KNOW THAT ONE FEELS

23:12.166 --> 23:14.200
A LITTLE HIGH.

23:14.266 --> 23:15.767
FANCAMS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN

23:15.834 --> 23:17.533
A SOURCE OF FUN ONLINE, BUT

23:17.600 --> 23:19.000
LATELY, A PARTICULAR SUBSET OF

23:19.066 --> 23:22.133
SOCIAL MEDIA USERS HAVE DEPLOYED

23:22.200 --> 23:22.633
THEM FOR REAL GOOD.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.767
>> ACROSS THE GLOBE, FANS OF

23:24.834 --> 23:26.133
KOREAN POP MUSIC KNOWN AS K-POP

23:26.200 --> 23:27.233
ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR FIERCE

23:27.300 --> 23:29.567
LOYALTY AND DEVOTION.

23:29.633 --> 23:30.467
AND NOW, THEY'RE SETTING THEIR

23:30.533 --> 23:32.000
SIGHTS ON RACIAL EQUALITY.

23:32.066 --> 23:33.567
BOMBARDING THE HASHTAG

23:33.633 --> 23:34.834
#WhiteLivesMatter, A SOCIAL

23:34.900 --> 23:37.166
MEDIA HASHTAG WITH TIES

23:37.233 --> 23:39.166
TO WHITE SUPREMACY, WITH A SEA

23:39.233 --> 23:42.333
OF K-POP MUSIC.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.400
MEMES AND MESSAGES LIKE

23:44.467 --> 23:46.700
"PROTECT THE PROTESTERS."

23:46.767 --> 23:48.233
THEY DO IT BY POSTING SO FAST

23:48.300 --> 23:49.633
AND FEVERISHLY THAT THEY DROWN

23:49.700 --> 23:51.066
OUT EVERYTHING ELSE.

23:51.133 --> 23:56.000
>> John: THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

23:56.066 --> 23:56.834
AND I HAVE TO SAY, IT IS

23:56.900 --> 23:57.900
GENUINELY REFRESHING TO SEE

23:57.967 --> 23:58.667
RACISTS GETTING DROWNED OUT IN

23:58.734 --> 23:59.467
AMERICA INSTEAD OF OUR USUAL

23:59.533 --> 24:00.867
POLICY OF LETTING THEM CO-STAR

24:00.934 --> 24:03.567
IN FAMILY CHRISTMAS COMEDIES.

24:03.633 --> 24:05.166
THE FACT IS, K-POP FANCAMS IN

24:05.233 --> 24:06.900
PARTICULAR HAVE ACTUALLY

24:06.967 --> 24:07.800
REPEATEDLY MANAGED TO DROWN OUT

24:07.867 --> 24:11.066
RACIST HASHTAGS.

24:11.133 --> 24:12.100
AND I LOVE THE IDEA OF SOMEONE

24:12.166 --> 24:13.133
SEARCHING "WHITE LIVES MATTER"

24:13.200 --> 24:14.667
FOR SOME RACIST CONTENT, AND

24:14.700 --> 24:16.166
INSTEAD FINDING ONLY STUFF LIKE

24:16.233 --> 24:18.834
THIS.

24:27.367 --> 24:28.333
>> John: WOW.

24:28.400 --> 24:28.533
OKAY.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.266
I KNOW I AM STATING THE OBVIOUS

24:31.333 --> 24:33.667
BUT HE CAN JUST OBJECTIVELY GET

24:33.734 --> 24:33.834
IT.

24:33.900 --> 24:34.934
AND IT'S FRANKLY SHAME-I DO

24:35.000 --> 24:36.867
THINK THAT KAY POPP HAS PRODUCED

24:36.934 --> 24:38.700
HIM, WHEN AMERICAN POP FANS ARE

24:38.767 --> 24:40.333
STUCK WITH ADAM LEVINE, A MAN

24:40.400 --> 24:42.433
WHO LOOKS LIKE THE WORLD'S

24:42.500 --> 24:43.367
SADDEST ADULT COLORING BOOK.

24:43.433 --> 24:46.300
AND THE THING IS, THE FANS ARE

24:46.367 --> 24:47.700
JUST TROLLING RACISTS.

24:47.767 --> 24:48.800
THEY MAY BE MANAGING TO HAVE

24:48.867 --> 24:50.200
REAL-WORLD IMPACT.

24:50.266 --> 24:50.900
NOT ONLY ARE THEY CLAIMING

24:50.967 --> 24:52.300
RESPONSIBILITY FOR MANY OF THE

24:52.367 --> 24:54.300
NO-SHOW TICKET REQUEST THAT LAST

24:54.367 --> 24:56.000
NIGHT'S TRUMP RALLY, THERE IS

24:56.066 --> 24:56.567
ALSO THIS.

24:56.633 --> 24:57.166
>> POLICE IN DALLAS ARE HAVING

24:57.233 --> 24:58.967
A HARD TIME TRYING TO CRACK DOWN

24:59.033 --> 24:59.834
ON VANDALS BECAUSE OF MUSIC

24:59.900 --> 25:00.433
FANS.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.800
THE DEPARTMENT TWEETED OUT

25:01.867 --> 25:02.800
AN APP FOR REPORTING PEOPLE

25:02.867 --> 25:04.467
INVOLVED BUT SOMEONE ASKED

25:04.533 --> 25:05.800
PEOPLE TO SUBMIT RANDOM OTHER

25:05.867 --> 25:06.600
VIDEOS TO PROTECT THE

25:06.667 --> 25:08.834
PROTESTORS.

25:08.900 --> 25:10.266
K-POP FANS RESPONDED WITH SO

25:10.333 --> 25:11.800
MANY VIDEOS FROM CONCERTS,

25:11.867 --> 25:12.800
THEY SAY THE APP STOPPED

25:12.867 --> 25:14.266
WORKING.

25:14.333 --> 25:15.266
DALLAS POLICE SAID THE APP IS

25:15.333 --> 25:16.533
NOW DOWN BECAUSE OF TECHNICAL

25:16.600 --> 25:22.100
DIFFICULTIES.

25:22.166 --> 25:24.266
>> John: OH.

25:24.333 --> 25:26.433
"TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES" IS AN

25:26.500 --> 25:28.567
INTERESTING WAY TO SAY "OUR APP

25:28.633 --> 25:30.467
WATCHED A THOUSAND VIDEOS OF BTS

25:30.533 --> 25:31.800
AND DIED OF HORNINESS," BUT I

25:31.867 --> 25:33.367
GUESS SOME PROGRAMS DON'T HAVE

25:33.433 --> 25:34.166
AN ERROR CODE FOR THAT YET.

25:34.233 --> 25:34.800
BUT THAT KIND OF SIGNAL-JAMMING

25:34.867 --> 25:35.433
IS NOT JUST LIMITED TO THE K-POP

25:35.500 --> 25:36.233
FANDOM.

25:36.300 --> 25:37.266
WHITE SUPREMACIST HASHTAGS HAVE

25:37.333 --> 25:38.400
ALSO BEEN BOMBARDED WITH VIDEOS

25:38.467 --> 25:39.266
LIKE THIS GIF OF MARIO AND

25:39.333 --> 25:40.467
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG FINALLY

25:40.533 --> 25:41.000
GIVING INTO THEIR

25:41.066 --> 25:42.133
CARNAL DESIRES.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.000
AND LOOK, IT WAS ONLY A MATTER

25:43.066 --> 25:48.333
OF TIME.

25:48.400 --> 25:49.533
AND I, FOR, ONE AM HAPPY FOR

25:49.600 --> 25:49.900
THEM.

25:49.967 --> 25:50.734
EVEN CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE

25:50.800 --> 25:51.433
FURRY COMMUNITY HAVE JOINED IN

25:51.500 --> 25:52.266
THE FIGHT, POSTING THINGS LIKE,

25:52.333 --> 25:53.300
"HEY, #WhiteLivesMatter RACISTS,

25:53.367 --> 25:54.500
LOOK AT MY FURSONA'S KNOTTED

25:54.567 --> 25:55.467
OTTER COCK.

25:55.533 --> 25:57.967
THANKS, SMILEY FACE."

25:58.033 --> 26:00.834
WHICH IS EXCELLENT.

26:00.900 --> 26:01.900
AND THANKS TO MANY, MANY

26:01.967 --> 26:02.767
CONTRIBUTIONS LIKE WHAT YOU'VE

26:02.834 --> 26:03.834
SEEN SO FAR, THE WHITE LIVES

26:03.900 --> 26:04.667
MATTER AND WHITE-OUT WEDNESDAY

26:04.734 --> 26:06.133
PROTESTS BECAME VIRTUALLY

26:06.200 --> 26:08.166
NON-FUNCTIONAL, AND WE SHOULD

26:08.233 --> 26:09.533
THANK EVERYONE INVOLVED FOR

26:09.600 --> 26:11.233
UNDERMINING THEM.

26:11.300 --> 26:12.667
AND I'LL BE HONEST, I KIND OF

26:12.734 --> 26:13.934
WANT TO GET IN ON THIS

26:14.000 --> 26:15.133
MAGNIFICENT MISSION, BUT I DON'T

26:15.200 --> 26:16.166
WANT TO DISRUPT WHAT EVERYONE

26:16.233 --> 26:17.400
ELSE IS DOING.

26:17.467 --> 26:18.467
SO I WAS THINKING, IF YOU

26:18.533 --> 26:20.300
HAPPEN TO BE A FAN OF K-POP,

26:20.367 --> 26:22.767
EROTIC ANIMAL ART, AND THIS

26:22.834 --> 26:24.700
SHOW, AND YOU WANT TO DROWN OUT

26:24.767 --> 26:26.667
RACIST HASHTAGS, A VIDEO THAT

26:26.734 --> 26:27.700
COMBINES ALL OF THOSE ELEMENTS

26:27.767 --> 26:31.367
MIGHT BE VERY USEFUL TO YOU.

26:31.433 --> 26:32.600
