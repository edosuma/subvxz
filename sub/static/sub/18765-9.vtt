WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.968
Previously on Grimm...

00:09.560 --> 00:10.607
What are you drawing?

00:10.720 --> 00:13.405
I promised Mommy I wouldn't tell
you what I saw in the tunnel.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.616
Do you know what
these symbols mean?

00:14.640 --> 00:16.529
She just said it
might be dangerous.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.647
Nick!

00:21.600 --> 00:23.125
What the hell was that?

00:37.040 --> 00:40.123
So, you felt the arm come through
the mirror in the Spice Shop?

00:40.200 --> 00:42.328
I saw it first,
and then I felt it.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.368
It choked her.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.096
And we're talking
that same skull creature

00:46.120 --> 00:48.282
you and Eve saw in
this bathroom mirror?

00:48.400 --> 00:49.401
Yes.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.016
Anybody else see anything
in your mirror since?

00:51.040 --> 00:52.405
Not me. No.

00:52.480 --> 00:53.536
But I don't think we would.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.688
It seems to be connected
to Eve, or...

00:56.000 --> 00:57.001
Or?

00:57.240 --> 00:58.321
Or it's after her.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.936
These spirits and entities
sometimes have a way

01:00.960 --> 01:03.884
of attaching themselves
to people of our world.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.287
But when Eve saw it
here, so did Nick.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.440
Maybe it's after Nick, too.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.481
That makes sense.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.564
I mean, Nick and Eve are pretty
deeply connected.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.881
I mean, you know, they were.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.284
You haven't seen
it any place else?

01:18.360 --> 01:19.361
Just a dream.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.084
Must have been
one hell of a dream.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.491
That wasn't a dream.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.129
Honey, you don't have to worry about this.
We can take care of it.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.326
I don't think so.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.608
Diana, if it wasn't
a dream, what was it?

01:32.680 --> 01:34.091
I don't know what you call it.

01:34.160 --> 01:37.004
Is it something that's not a
dream, but it's also not real?

01:37.080 --> 01:39.003
It's something
that's not real yet.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.764
Something that's
going to happen?

01:40.960 --> 01:42.689
Uh-huh. Do you know where?

01:42.760 --> 01:45.491
In the other place, through
the hole in the mirror.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.768
I'm sorry, "through
the hole in the mirror"?

01:47.840 --> 01:49.001
Okay, we need a buddy system

01:49.080 --> 01:50.136
'cause nobody can
look into a mirror

01:50.160 --> 01:51.969
by themselves until
we figure this out.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.044
And you are staying at
our place until we do.

01:59.880 --> 02:02.201
No, no, no, listen to me.
DEVI All right.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.896
It's... DEV: You do
not know what you're saying.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.287
It's a known fact.
Chicks dig camo.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.640
Huh? What? It makes you
invisible to the deer

02:08.720 --> 02:10.210
and irresistible to the ladies.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.840
Look, I ain't taking
advice from someone

02:11.880 --> 02:13.016
that's French-kissed
their cousin.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.041
Ah, get out of here.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.800
She had a boyfriend. It's not like
anything was really gonna happen.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.685
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.164
Okay, give me that.
Give me the thing.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.321
Bye-bye, Bambi.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.845
I think I got her. I
think I got her!

02:40.080 --> 02:41.081
Whoo!

02:46.920 --> 02:48.684
Oh, more beer.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.725
I got blood!

02:54.800 --> 02:57.280
I got her! I got her!

02:59.160 --> 03:01.083
I'm right behind you, buddy.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.281
Dev?

03:50.440 --> 03:51.601
Dev!

03:51.800 --> 03:53.006
DEVI Ralph!

03:53.440 --> 03:55.204
Ralph!

03:58.040 --> 03:59.121
Ralph!

03:59.200 --> 04:00.281
Dev?

04:01.520 --> 04:03.170
Hey, man, this ain't funny.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.481
Ralph.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.766
Dev! Ralph...

04:09.840 --> 04:11.080
What the hell did you do, man?

04:11.240 --> 04:12.480
Hey!

04:12.560 --> 04:14.005
What the hell's going on here?

04:19.680 --> 04:20.680
Dev!

04:27.200 --> 04:28.281
Dev!

04:33.880 --> 04:34.927
Dev!

04:35.040 --> 04:36.201
Dev!

05:47.080 --> 05:48.969
Ready to shave. Coming.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.240
Okay-

05:54.280 --> 05:56.726
Wait. By the way, when you saw
what Eve saw in this mirror,

05:56.800 --> 05:58.211
how did you get it to go away?

05:58.280 --> 06:00.681
I didn't. It just looked
at me and went away.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.524
Because it saw you?
That's what Eve thinks.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.601
Well, what do you think?

06:04.120 --> 06:05.804
I think it knows I'm a Grimm,

06:05.880 --> 06:08.167
but this skull thing is
connected to Eve in some way.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.520
Maybe because
she's a Hexenbiest,

06:09.560 --> 06:10.925
which is why
I'm worried about you.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.401
I'm not gonna be looking in
any mirrors without you.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.930
Okay, go for it.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.320
You see anything other than me?

06:19.800 --> 06:21.404
No. You? No.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.120
What if this thing
isn't afraid of Grimms?

06:25.800 --> 06:27.416
You know, I kind of
like you with the stubble.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.646
Me, too.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.970
It's Wu. You want coffee?

06:31.040 --> 06:32.280
Please.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.480
Hey. What've you got?

06:38.520 --> 06:41.091
Hey. Picked one up from the
Sheriff out on Highway 30.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.730
Should've been just a DUI,

06:42.800 --> 06:46.122
but he is refusing to get
in the ambulance and leave.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.801
He's ranting that his friend was
killed by a monster in the woods.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.848
Seemed like it
might be up our alley.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.767
Sheriffs are not taking
it very seriously.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.203
Okay. Give me a mile marker.

06:58.280 --> 06:59.520
Sixty-eight.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.726
Be there as soon as we can.

07:10.720 --> 07:11.926
Driver is Ralph Rotterman.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.126
Crashed sometime last night.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.123
Reported at 5:18 a.m.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.929
by a passerby who called 911,

07:17.040 --> 07:18.769
but did not stop due
to Mr. Rotterman's

07:18.840 --> 07:20.968
ranting and bleeding.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.656
Judging by the carpet
of beer cans inside,

07:22.680 --> 07:24.728
the Driving Under the
Influence of lntoxicants part

07:24.840 --> 07:26.126
seems like an understatement.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.601
- A lot of ammo, .30-06.
- Mmm.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.121
Any sign of rifles?

07:30.200 --> 07:31.804
No, not inside.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.176
Sheriffs took a look around.
So did I.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.281
Couldn't find anything.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.056
Would you let them know
that we'll handle him.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.809
They will be
relieved to hear that.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.480
Get out of here!
I'm not going anywhere!

07:39.560 --> 07:41.403
Let go of me! Hey! Hey!

07:41.560 --> 07:43.016
You've got to do something!
Hey! Bring it down!

07:43.040 --> 07:45.805
Dev is still out there. Okay, okay, okay.
Bring it down.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.166
Tell us what happened.

07:47.480 --> 07:48.481
Okay-

07:48.560 --> 07:50.256
Dev and I were out
driving last night, right?

07:50.280 --> 07:52.216
And I stopped the truck, and
he just ran into the woods,

07:52.240 --> 07:54.925
and then I heard him screaming,
and I thought he was kidding.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.684
But then I found him.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.536
He was getting all strangled
by these plants or something.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.040
And then one of
them just stabbed him!

08:00.080 --> 08:01.809
And then this thing, it...

08:01.880 --> 08:03.176
I don't know. It just came
out of nowhere, okay?

08:03.200 --> 08:05.441
It was like a monster.
It was a monster.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.649
I know you think I'm crazy. I know
you think I'm crazy, but I'm not!

08:08.720 --> 08:09.960
It was real! It was...

08:10.040 --> 08:11.644
- We're gonna help you.
- You believe me?

08:11.960 --> 08:13.724
We'll find your friend. Okay.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.290
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.691
Look, it's way back
in the forest.

08:16.760 --> 08:17.776
It's all the way
up the dirt road.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.416
Why don't you just show us
where it happened?

08:19.440 --> 08:21.408
- Okay.
- Yeah. Let's go.

08:21.520 --> 08:22.760
Now, come on.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.524
I'm not gonna hurt you. Come on.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.571
It was crazy.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.896
I heard him screaming, so I was
running as fast as I could.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.680
Look, I didn't know
what I was going to find,

08:31.720 --> 08:33.336
but I sure didn't
think it was what I saw.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.361
Come on. Come on.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.056
All right, this is where
the screaming stopped,

08:36.080 --> 08:37.176
but it's not where it happened.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.929
This your rifle? No, it's Dev's.

08:41.880 --> 08:42.880
.30-06.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.002
- Dev shoot this deer last night?
- Uh, maybe.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.520
I don't know.
That's... I didn't see.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.056
Look, that's not what
I'm trying to tell you!

08:48.080 --> 08:49.800
Oh, so nobody ever
informed you that hunting

08:49.880 --> 08:51.882
at night with
a spotlight is poaching?

08:51.960 --> 08:54.096
You think poaching is the problem here?
My friend is dead!

08:54.120 --> 08:55.326
Show us.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.282
This is where it happened, all right?
This is my rifle.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.967
Do not touch the rifle, Ralph.
We'll take care of it.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.451
Tell us what happened here.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.640
Okay-

09:09.680 --> 09:12.889
I found Dev on the ground, and he
was covered in plants and stuff.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.291
And then I tried to help him.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.007
And this vine, it came
right through his chest,

09:17.080 --> 09:19.003
and there was blood
everywhere, and...

09:20.480 --> 09:22.801
That's what killed him, okay?
I watched him die.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.041
Is that Dev's blood on you?

09:24.120 --> 09:25.167
Maybe.

09:25.640 --> 09:26.641
What happened next?

09:26.720 --> 09:28.722
This thing came out.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.971
It was all covered in
leaves and moss and mud,

09:32.040 --> 09:33.336
and it had vines for arms,
and it picked him up.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.771
It picked him right up!

09:34.840 --> 09:36.171
And what did you do?

09:36.240 --> 09:37.241
Shot it.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.924
But it didn't do nothing.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.763
And then I ran because I thought
it was coming after me.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.763
And do you know
where Dev's body is?

09:45.160 --> 09:46.924
It was right here.

09:47.680 --> 09:48.806
It was the last I saw.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.056
Either this guy
is telling the truth,

09:54.080 --> 09:56.096
or he killed his friend
and is trying to cover it up.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.376
How do you guys
want to handle this?

09:57.400 --> 09:59.402
Get CSU out here.
Sweep the area.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.216
Take the rifles as evidence.
See if they were fired.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.416
Right now, let's get
these dogs out here.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.616
See if they can find the body.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.847
We'll sweat him a little bit.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.250
Come with us.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.806
We have other work to do first.

10:17.880 --> 10:18.920
I want to see that mirror.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.041
Not alone, you don't.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.296
Are we sure we want to do this?

10:21.320 --> 10:22.367
Not entirely.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.601
Where is it?

10:40.400 --> 10:41.561
I broke this mirror,

10:42.400 --> 10:43.731
and it shattered into pieces,

10:43.800 --> 10:45.564
and the pieces all
came back together.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.051
It's not a magic mirror.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.696
It belonged to my mother. It's been
in my family since I can remember.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.240
I think as long as none of us look
into it, we're probably okay.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.401
Let's hope.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.283
Yeah. No window I can see.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.406
Oh, that's not good.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.563
Okay. That's enough of that.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.400
Diana said that through the
mirror is the other place.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.560
Yeah, we need to figure out

11:22.600 --> 11:24.887
what the hell is going on
with this "other place."

11:26.520 --> 11:27.965
There might be only one way.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.881
Which is?

11:31.240 --> 11:32.480
To go there.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.887
Dev's last living relative is
a grandmother in Mississippi.

11:39.960 --> 11:43.328
Both he and Ralph have records,
mostly of the yahoo type.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.402
DUls, criminal trespass,

11:45.480 --> 11:48.962
hunting without a license,
waste of deer and elk.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.884
So, not your run-of-the-mill
tree-huggers?

11:51.960 --> 11:54.042
No. What'd you get?

11:54.120 --> 11:55.884
Both rifles were fired.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.610
Ralph had two bullets
in the magazine.

11:57.680 --> 11:58.920
You took two out of Dev's.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.321
So, assuming they never
had a chance to reload

12:01.400 --> 12:04.529
and my addition is correct,
they each fired one shot.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.806
The deer took one bullet.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.645
And Ralph was never hit, which
leaves one bullet unaccounted for.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.849
No, Ralph said he
shot the monster,

12:13.080 --> 12:15.082
unless Dev was his monster.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.402
Dev was Wesen? Maybe.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.563
Dev could've Woged. Ralph freaked,
shot him, buried the body.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.290
Or Ralph just didn't like Dev

12:22.360 --> 12:24.328
and killed him
and made all this up.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.881
So, Dev is not the first person

12:26.960 --> 12:28.928
to go missing in
that general area.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.367
Three others in the last five
years, bodies never recovered.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.727
- Any reports mention a monster?
- No.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.041
But there is something
that garnered my attention.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.646
Usually, people that go missing
in the wild are hikers,

12:38.720 --> 12:41.326
mountain bikers, joggers,
but these three were not.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.925
Their vehicles
were found abandoned.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.447
No suicide notes, no last
arguments with spouses, nothing.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.409
Just parked vehicles
in the woods.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.448
Sounds like
a classic alien abduction.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.920
Hadn't gone there yet,
but I'm open.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.376
Dev and Ralph were poaching.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.696
See if you can find what the other
three were doing out there.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.530
Yeah. We'll take Ralph
through it one more time.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.326
Maybe Ralph forgot
to mention the space ship.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.045
It was shaped like a man.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.289
It killed my friend!

13:06.360 --> 13:09.125
You said Dev shot the rifle,
and he killed the deer.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.964
Yeah, he...
I already told you that.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.929
You shoot your rifle
and kill a monster.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.126
It killed Dev!

13:14.200 --> 13:16.202
Maybe you and Dev had a
little too much to drink.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.616
You had a little argument.
No, no, no, no!

13:17.640 --> 13:19.130
We had nothing, all right?

13:19.200 --> 13:20.929
Maybe you thought
Dev was the monster.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.047
What? No!

13:22.120 --> 13:23.804
Maybe you saw
Dev change into it.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.211
You shoot animals in the dark.

13:25.280 --> 13:28.170
Killing a few animals isn't
the same as killing a person!

13:29.320 --> 13:31.129
Look, I saw my friend
get killed.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.169
You two are in here.
You're wasting time.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.536
You should be out
trying to stop this thing!

13:34.560 --> 13:36.608
The blood on your
jacket wasn't yours.

13:36.680 --> 13:37.920
'Cause it stabbed him!

13:37.960 --> 13:39.485
It was Dev's blood, wasn't it?
Yeah.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.616
I was trying to help him. That's
why it was on my jacket, okay?

13:41.640 --> 13:43.165
I tried to shoot this thing!

13:43.240 --> 13:45.004
But Dev got in the way, right?

13:45.080 --> 13:46.127
No!

13:46.640 --> 13:47.766
No.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.081
Yeah. Yeah, okay?
But there was...

13:50.160 --> 13:52.925
He was... Dev was already dead.
It didn't matter, okay?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.968
I was trying to shoot the thing.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.247
Okay, look, it was awful, okay?

13:57.320 --> 13:59.607
It was crazy. It was like nothing...

14:09.000 --> 14:11.241
Results came back from the
lab on Ralph's jacket.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.687
We already got the report.
Not Ralph's blood.

14:13.760 --> 14:14.761
Different report.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.605
And it's not blood.
They found something else.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.126
Please tell me we're not
going Deliverance on this.

14:20.640 --> 14:21.971
No.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.247
Large amounts of chlorophyll.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.880
Lab tech said it was
in a concentration

14:26.920 --> 14:28.604
that doesn't exist in nature.

14:28.720 --> 14:29.926
One sample from Ralph's jacket

14:30.000 --> 14:33.209
had the same amount of chlorophyll
usually found in a tree.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.566
And I'm not talking sapling.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.005
More like giant sequoia.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.570
We're talking plant blood?

14:37.640 --> 14:40.564
Ralph said the thing he saw was
covered in vines and leaves.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.210
Doesn't exactly sound Wesen.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.480
We'll check the books, see
if there's anything close.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.610
I, uh, would like
to practice my English.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.330
Not many people
speak it out here.

15:22.880 --> 15:23.881
So,

15:25.240 --> 15:29.290
your daughter has drawn a very
unusual combination of symbols-

15:29.800 --> 15:32.531
Some ancient,
some unknown to me,

15:32.600 --> 15:36.366
which suggests that they are
coming from her own imagination-

15:36.840 --> 15:41.164
However, I asked myself how this
young daughter of Sean Renard

15:41.240 --> 15:43.288
knows such ancient symbols
in the first place,

15:43.360 --> 15:45.283
and why would she draw them?

15:46.360 --> 15:48.681
So, is there something I need
to know about her mother?

15:50.160 --> 15:51.446
She's a Hexenbiest.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.324
I suspected this.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.728
Are you together? No.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.131
It was complicated.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.248
Sean, everything with you
is always complicated.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.766
Does your daughter
have your abilities?

16:01.840 --> 16:04.411
She has more than me
and her mother combined.

16:04.840 --> 16:05.887
Hmm.

16:06.480 --> 16:07.481
What?

16:07.560 --> 16:11.121
You mentioned that Diana drew
what she saw in the tunnel.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.208
I find this interesting.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.807
<i>What kind of tunnel is it,
in Oregon of all places,</i>

16:16.880 --> 16:18.962
that would have this
combination of symbols?

16:19.080 --> 16:20.081
I don't know.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.003
I suggest you find out,

16:22.080 --> 16:26.608
because I think much of what she has
drawn is not from her imagination,

16:26.680 --> 16:28.444
nor from anywhere we know.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.605
Call me when you find out.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.763
I think it will be very
important sooner than later.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.844
So, this mossy, muddy, leafy,
rooty-armed description

16:51.920 --> 16:54.730
sounds like something out of an
apocalyptic environmental nightmare.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.325
Hey, that's all we got.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.480
You couldn't find the body?

16:57.520 --> 16:59.887
Not a body, body
parts or clothing.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.531
So, it took the human,
left the animal? Yeah.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.522
Well, maybe it only
wants humans.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.569
Something cannibalistic
like a Wendigo.

17:07.640 --> 17:10.211
We were able to find other missing
person reports in that area.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.362
We don't know if there's
a connection yet,

17:12.440 --> 17:14.886
but we haven't been able to find
any of those bodies either.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.089
Well, the woods are lovely,
dark and deep,

17:17.160 --> 17:19.049
and full of dead bodies
of all sorts.

17:19.119 --> 17:21.009
You said the missing
victim was poaching.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.684
Took us right to
the deer they shot.

17:23.839 --> 17:26.002
Huh, I wonder if it
could be a Curupira.

17:26.599 --> 17:27.681
That's Brazilian, right?

17:27.760 --> 17:29.524
Yeah. Oh, or the one
from Russia.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.201
Oh, a Leshy.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.560
What are we talking about?

17:32.640 --> 17:34.536
Well, there're some Wesen
that are ecologically wired

17:34.560 --> 17:36.296
to protect the natural
environment they live in.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.482
Yeah. Usually,
forest Wesen who do not

17:38.560 --> 17:40.801
take kindly to
disrespecting nature.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.656
You know, it's like if someone
went into your house,

17:42.680 --> 17:45.365
broke in, shot your
dog, ate your cat,

17:45.440 --> 17:46.521
fished in your aquarium,

17:47.240 --> 17:50.084
set your kitchen on fire,
and peed in your bed.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.525
Would have
the same kind of effect.

17:51.640 --> 17:52.880
And by that, he means,

17:52.960 --> 17:54.136
if you mess with
their territory,

17:54.160 --> 17:55.889
they will seriously mess you up.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.610
So, uh, do we know of any
of those in this area?

18:00.680 --> 18:01.680
Not me.

18:01.720 --> 18:04.246
This one's not from here either,

18:04.320 --> 18:05.936
but you know anything
about a Kinoshimobe?

18:05.960 --> 18:06.960
Uh-uh.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.162
Japanese? Yeah.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.609
It matches Ralph's description.

18:11.680 --> 18:14.286
Looks like something
that could bleed chlorophyll.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.842
"There was insufficient
information of the Kinoshimobe,

18:16.920 --> 18:21.289
"considering these observations
of Akemi Ando Araki"

18:21.360 --> 18:23.727
"are unreliable
and opiate-addled."

18:23.800 --> 18:26.849
"His findings detail the
elusive solitary beings,"

18:26.920 --> 18:29.810
"and though other recorded
accounts are exiguous..."

18:29.920 --> 18:32.526
That's one of my favorite words.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.841
"There was a testimony
regarding its human form,"

18:34.920 --> 18:36.968
"if indeed it has one."

18:37.040 --> 18:41.728
"And those captured are never seen
again, lost to the boscage..."

18:43.440 --> 18:45.044
"Boscage," ' anybody?
Not a cllue.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.320
Has to do with a lot of trees.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.283
It's like a grove or a thicket.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.681
"Lost to the boscage
for eternity."

18:50.760 --> 18:52.683
So, the bodies are never found.

18:52.760 --> 18:57.243
Maybe he does eat them or feeds
them to his furry forest friends.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.930
So, no description of what it
looks like when it's not Woged.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.571
Maybe he never Woges, right?

19:03.640 --> 19:05.404
I mean, if it's
an environmental protector,

19:05.480 --> 19:07.323
maybe it's always in,
like, protector mode.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.129
Could be. So...

19:09.720 --> 19:11.961
If it is a Kinoshimobe
or a Curupira

19:12.040 --> 19:13.166
or whatever

19:13.240 --> 19:14.241
and it's killing someone

19:14.320 --> 19:15.376
that's destroying
where it lives,

19:15.400 --> 19:18.643
I mean, isn't there a law that
allows you to defend your home?

19:18.760 --> 19:20.364
Yes, but the circumstances
of the defense

19:20.440 --> 19:21.851
are always taken
into consideration.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.206
No, she's right.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.011
What if it's like
a deep biological drive?

19:26.080 --> 19:28.056
That would be like blaming a
spider for killing a fly.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.320
Not that a web is a home.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.164
I'm just saying, we're
in a moral green area,

19:31.240 --> 19:32.287
if you will.

19:32.920 --> 19:33.967
Wu.

19:34.560 --> 19:35.561
Yeah.

19:36.840 --> 19:37.921
Okay-

19:39.480 --> 19:40.936
Wu's got something
he wants us to see.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.962
We'll call you when we
find out what that is.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.525
Okeydokey. Okay.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.524
If this dude is Wesen...

19:48.600 --> 19:50.523
That is no Wesen I've ever seen.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.164
Went back 20 years this time.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.656
There have been
at least 10 disappearances

20:48.680 --> 20:50.409
in the same part of the forest,

20:50.480 --> 20:52.244
all within the last five years.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.606
Ran background checks,

20:53.680 --> 20:55.364
every single one has a record,

20:55.480 --> 20:57.482
punished or fined
for crimes against nature,

20:57.560 --> 20:59.403
and not the Bible-thumping
sex kind.

20:59.480 --> 21:01.721
I mean poaching,
polluting, et cetera.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.369
Then it's got to be
the Kinoshimobe.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.683
I'm assuming
that's Wesenese for...

21:06.760 --> 21:08.205
Sort of an Eco-revenger.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.442
Dev's being punished
for shooting the deer.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.285
But Ralph didn't shoot the deer,
which is why he was spared.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.801
We go back out there
first thing tomorrow morning.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.205
Okay, so, do we know what to do

22:53.280 --> 22:55.009
with this Kinoshimobe
if we find it?

22:55.080 --> 22:57.048
The book didn't have
much to say about it.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.360
It might not even be Wesen.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.256
We find Dev's body, maybe
we'll learn something

23:00.280 --> 23:02.123
about how this thing operates.

23:05.480 --> 23:08.882
Well, you couldn't ask for a prettier
place to get brutally murdered.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.644
Let's spread out.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.361
Ugh.

24:50.400 --> 24:54.086
Guys, I've got a truck. Looks like
it had been dumping toxic waste.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.242
There is also blood on a chair.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.321
Any bodies?

24:58.920 --> 25:00.001
Not yet.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.241
Headed your way.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.560
COPY-

25:12.600 --> 25:15.809
I hope it's not as
bad for us as it smells.

25:16.320 --> 25:17.526
That's really disgusting.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.250
We're gonna have
to call the EPA.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.685
No driver?

25:20.760 --> 25:22.250
Except maybe for that.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.002
Blood's not dry yet.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.481
Truck's registered
to a Patricia Vetvark.

25:32.560 --> 25:36.042
1037 Lee Street,
West Haven-Sylvan.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.043
And, surprise,
she's got herself a record

25:38.120 --> 25:39.770
for illegal dumping
of toxic waste

25:39.880 --> 25:42.167
on public lands all over the state.
Mmm.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.528
Been fined seven times
and never gone to jail.

25:44.600 --> 25:45.601
Slap on the wrist.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.644
Got slapped harder this time.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.842
She owns a hazardous
waste treatment company,

25:49.920 --> 25:51.126
G&K Waste Solutions.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.806
Dumping in the woods should
not be considered a solution.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.136
Everyone who went
missing went missing

25:55.160 --> 25:56.525
in the same part of the woods.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.045
Yeah, within about
five square miles.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.049
Do you have that list of them?
Not on me.

26:00.160 --> 26:02.640
Well, you want to get it?
Of course.

26:08.520 --> 26:11.000
Allow me to tell you where they
went missing.

26:11.520 --> 26:15.286
Arnold Quinn, went missing
at the Newton Trailhead.

26:17.320 --> 26:20.722
Sina Menjivar, uh,
last seen where.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.529
Wildwood Trail
meets Newton Road.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.601
Stephanie Katz, end of BPA road.

26:28.040 --> 26:31.726
Esteban Mendez, intersection
of Firelanes 15 and 12.

26:32.360 --> 26:35.045
Roger Markowitz,
Newton Creek Bridge.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.525
I think we got a perimeter.

26:38.600 --> 26:39.601
There's more.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.444
Not sure we need it.

26:43.760 --> 26:44.880
We need to see what's there.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.367
This is where Arnold
Quinn went missing.

26:50.440 --> 26:53.091
If we cut through here,
we should get to the center.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.009
This is where I
was this morning.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.291
That's one hell of a tree.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.408
Yeah, it caught
my attention, too.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.687
I had this weird feeling.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.448
What kind of weird feeling?

27:18.520 --> 27:20.363
Not "normal" weird.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.776
Yeah, but when you
get a weird feeling,

27:22.800 --> 27:24.404
it's different
from when I get one.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.403
Getting a weird vibe here, too.

27:27.720 --> 27:30.724
Okay, now I'm getting
a weird vibe feeling.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.246
But I don't know if
it's yours or mine.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.560
That doesn't look
like chlorophyll.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.648
Yeah, it's damp all around.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.642
Nick. Wu.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.767
This looks like a man's face.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.091
Screaming.

28:02.120 --> 28:05.886
Okay, now I really do have a weird
feeling, and it's all mine.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.081
There's another one.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.204
Oh, my God.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.965
This gives a whole new
meaning to "family tree."

28:28.880 --> 28:30.723
I know about this kind of tree.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.963
I didn't think of it before because
it's not Wesen or monster per Se.

28:34.040 --> 28:37.089
It's just a tree, except it
survives on human blood.

28:37.160 --> 28:38.936
Well, that explains
the blood around the tree.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.724
It's called a Jubokko.
Never heard of it.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.087
Are you suggesting that
this tree can somehow move?

28:43.200 --> 28:44.201
From what I know,

28:44.280 --> 28:46.456
Jubokkos are rooted to the
ground just like any other tree.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.847
Okay, that doesn't
exactly explain the faces.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.331
No, but we think we can.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.325
Oh, my God!

28:59.720 --> 29:00.721
How did that happen?

29:00.840 --> 29:01.921
We have no idea.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.456
But every one of them
has a criminal history

29:03.480 --> 29:05.084
of environmental degradation.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.083
Okay, so, either somebody carved

29:07.160 --> 29:09.049
these ignoramuses'
faces into the tree...

29:09.120 --> 29:11.771
Or the tree absorbed
them into itself?

29:11.880 --> 29:12.927
Oh.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.162
Anybody know how that works?

29:15.920 --> 29:18.764
Ralph said he saw Dev being
dragged away by a monster.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.805
- And that is Dev right there.
- Yes.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.963
And I'm guessing that is the bullet
hole that Ralph put in Dev's head.

29:24.040 --> 29:27.442
Maybe the Kinoshimobe and the
Jubokko are working together.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.682
So, the Kinoshimobe
kills them and feeds

29:29.760 --> 29:31.330
the Jubokko tree their blood.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.482
It's like a beautiful
symbiotic relationship.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.291
We found the tree, but how
do we find the Kinoshimobe?

29:36.360 --> 29:38.442
Well, it responds to
environmental damage.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.000
You might have to go out there
and cause a little harm.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.128
I don't know how I feel about that.
Mmm. Me either.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.256
Well, maybe there's
something we can do

29:44.280 --> 29:46.056
to make it seem like
we're harming the forest.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.321
Like, uh, fake toxic sludge?

29:49.960 --> 29:51.086
Oh!

29:51.160 --> 29:52.605
Wait. I think I have an idea.
What?

29:52.680 --> 29:54.603
My brother and I, we
used to have so much fun

29:54.680 --> 29:56.489
with this book
when we were kids.

29:56.560 --> 29:57.971
Where is it?

29:58.520 --> 29:59.760
Oh, yeah.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.365
We used to make
this strange goop.

30:02.720 --> 30:05.530
Humano-Reptiliana: Pathology,
Diagnosis and Treatment-

30:12.240 --> 30:13.480
Oh. Yeah!

30:13.560 --> 30:14.561
Vle Di Bouyi.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.121
Oh, it smells terrible,

30:16.200 --> 30:17.611
and it's really only harmful

30:17.680 --> 30:19.489
to Wesen with scales.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.336
Grimms in the south
used to use it to lure out.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.488
Gelumcaedus
from the swampy marshes

30:23.560 --> 30:26.006
and catch them,
chop off their heads.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.766
Our childhoods were very different.
Mmm.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.928
It poses no known threat
to the environment.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.571
I think it causes some gnarly
skin rash to reptilian Wesen,

30:33.640 --> 30:35.642
but that's about
the worst it does.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.848
My brother and I, we used
to mess with our neighbor,

30:37.920 --> 30:39.809
this nasty Skalengeck.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.370
He ate my best
friend's Chihuahua.

30:42.600 --> 30:43.840
How long does it take to make?

30:44.400 --> 30:46.323
Uh, a few hours,
it's pretty involved.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.560
I mean, how much do you need?

30:47.600 --> 30:49.416
A lot. We really wanna get
this thing's attention.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.442
All right, let's get on it.

30:51.520 --> 30:55.650
Okay, say we do find this plant
dude, how do we deal with it?

30:56.440 --> 30:59.046
Considering what
happened with Dev,

30:59.120 --> 31:01.282
I'm not sure bullets
are going to be enough.

31:02.240 --> 31:03.605
We're gonna need
something sharp.

31:20.960 --> 31:21.961
Yep-

31:22.120 --> 31:24.202
Looks like a Jubokko, all right.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.601
Got to say, for a tree that
survives on human blood,

31:26.680 --> 31:28.887
it looks pretty harmless.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.371
Get closer.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.242
Sweet Moses!

31:40.320 --> 31:42.482
Gives you a real sense
of being one with nature.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.722
All right, you know there's
a thing called pareidolia?

31:44.840 --> 31:46.808
It tricks the brain into
thinking it sees faces

31:46.880 --> 31:47.927
in inanimate objects,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.321
and it can happen because
of sleep deprivation.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.448
And none of us is
particularly well rested.

31:52.520 --> 31:53.646
You're not hallucinating.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.724
I sleep like a baby, and that tree
right there is full of faces.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.404
Yeah, well...

32:05.080 --> 32:06.081
Yeah, okay, it is.

32:06.160 --> 32:07.161
Let's do this.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.321
Hope this works.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.681
Smells like it might.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.201
Make sure you
pour it all around.

32:17.840 --> 32:21.083
I've got kind of mixed feelings
about this. I mean, I love trees.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.884
It's not a normal tree, Monroe.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.604
Yeah, but still,

32:24.680 --> 32:27.331
I think I shall never see a poem

32:27.400 --> 32:31.166
as lovely as a blood-sucking
Jubokko tree.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.245
Just in case.

32:55.160 --> 32:57.162
Any guesses as to how
long this is gonna take?

32:57.240 --> 32:58.765
Well,

32:58.840 --> 33:01.366
if anybody did to my home
what we just did here,

33:01.440 --> 33:02.726
I wouldn't wait long.

33:17.840 --> 33:20.127
Does anybody get the
feeling we got this wrong?

33:21.120 --> 33:23.566
Uh, what about the
faces in the tree?

33:23.640 --> 33:26.405
Maybe we're underestimating
the Kinoshimobe.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.005
I mean, it could
know this is a trick,

33:28.080 --> 33:30.606
assuming it has that
kind of mental capacity.

33:30.680 --> 33:31.736
Maybe it's not toxic enough.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.056
Why don't you give
Rosalee a call,

33:33.080 --> 33:34.570
see if she can spice it up.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.966
All right,
but we can't go nuclear.

33:39.040 --> 33:40.451
I still have to
live with myself,

33:40.520 --> 33:42.807
which is already challenging
enough, as it is.

33:47.840 --> 33:48.887
Rosalee?

33:48.960 --> 33:50.246
Hey. Is it working?

33:50.440 --> 33:51.726
Not exactly.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.649
Yeah, we dumped it,
but nothing's happening.

33:53.760 --> 33:54.807
We need to spike it.

33:54.880 --> 33:57.247
You got anything that would
do just a little damage?

33:58.440 --> 33:59.726
Turpentine might work.

33:59.800 --> 34:03.327
It's natural, made from pine
sap, but still pretty toxic.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.280
How long would it take
to make another batch?

34:05.320 --> 34:07.256
Don't need to. I'll just
bring the turpentine to you.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.920
It's not harmful to
pregnant women, is it?

34:08.960 --> 34:10.291
Not unless I drink it.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.562
I'll be there soon.
Send the directions.

34:12.639 --> 34:14.130
I'll do it. Thank you.

34:18.239 --> 34:22.085
I'm sorry. Is anyone else
questioning the wisdom of this?

34:22.159 --> 34:24.136
I mean, the thing we're
trying to coax out and kill

34:24.159 --> 34:26.686
is actually trying
to protect the forest.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.246
Yeah, and killing
a few people to do it.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.561
Yeah, but those people
are killing the forest.

34:31.639 --> 34:32.846
Killing them is all right?

34:32.920 --> 34:34.570
I just don't see
how you can blame

34:34.639 --> 34:36.927
the Kinoshimobe for
protecting its habitat.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.208
Especially when it's
doing it in an organic,

34:41.280 --> 34:44.409
all natural, free-range
kind of self-defense.

34:44.480 --> 34:48.768
Well, if it endangers this
species, it's going down.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.004
Hey. MONROE: Hey, are you close?

34:59.080 --> 35:01.924
Yeah, I just pulled off the highway.
I'm on the dirt road.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.684
Okay, good.
Can you see our tracks?

35:04.000 --> 35:05.684
Uh, yeah. I see them.

35:05.760 --> 35:08.764
Okay. We're about,
I don't know, half a mile in.

35:10.600 --> 35:11.761
Road's a little rough.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.450
Yeah, just go slow.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.443
Okay, see you in a few.

35:21.040 --> 35:24.123
All of these faces seem like
they're in a great deal of pain.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.804
Almost like
they're still suffering.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.484
This payback is permanent.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.324
Rosalee should be here by now.

35:39.160 --> 35:40.605
Ooh.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.640
Oh, crap.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.409
Where are you?

35:57.480 --> 35:58.766
We've got a problem.

35:58.880 --> 36:01.565
I think I hit a rock. I'm leaking oil.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.242
Okay, just stay where you are.
I'll come to you.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.163
Okay.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.684
Monroe, I...

36:13.960 --> 36:16.361
Rosalee? Oh, my God!

36:20.560 --> 36:21.766
Monroe!

36:22.080 --> 36:23.320
Monroe!

36:25.200 --> 36:28.010
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.122
Rosalee, where are you?

36:30.200 --> 36:31.281
Nick!

36:33.000 --> 36:34.240
This way.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.241
Rosalee!

36:50.960 --> 36:52.803
Monroe, over here!

36:53.320 --> 36:54.845
Oh, thank God.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.081
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.650
I saw it!
It was right behind me!

36:57.720 --> 36:59.210
Where'd it go? I have no idea.

36:59.320 --> 37:01.926
All right, we're
getting you out of here now.

37:06.040 --> 37:07.041
Whoa!

37:07.160 --> 37:08.446
Is that the Jubokko?

37:08.520 --> 37:09.646
Oh, it's so beautiful.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.120
Not once you get to know it.
Get in!

37:12.720 --> 37:14.722
No! Oh, my God!

37:14.800 --> 37:15.801
Nick! Nick!

37:27.000 --> 37:29.128
What the hell was that?
That wasn't in the book.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.609
That is in the book.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.321
I, uh...

37:46.640 --> 37:50.201
I don't know if you can
understand me, but I'm a Grimm.

37:52.360 --> 37:53.691
Don't think he's
much of a talker.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.646
Oh, crap.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.241
So, what do we do now?

39:23.440 --> 39:24.646
You can't arrest a tree.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.256
After what it did to Rosalee,

39:26.280 --> 39:28.647
I'm fine to chop it down
and cut it into firewood.

39:28.760 --> 39:29.936
With all those faces in there?

39:29.960 --> 39:31.803
That's just too terrible
to even think about.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.122
The Kinoshimobe is dead,

39:42.640 --> 39:43.680
or whatever you call that.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.131
More like entombed.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.850
Talk about back to nature.

39:47.480 --> 39:48.481
So,

39:49.960 --> 39:51.689
we've done all we can do.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.450
Yeah, let's hit it.
Yeah, let's go.

39:57.320 --> 39:58.321
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.561
When the Jubokko
opened itself up

40:07.640 --> 40:11.440
and gathered the dead
Kinoshimobe back into...

40:12.400 --> 40:14.084
Can we call that a "womb"?

40:14.160 --> 40:17.687
I'm just gonna go out on a limb
here and say, "a womb with a view."

40:18.000 --> 40:19.411
Wow. You really went there.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.568
Gathered back into itself,

40:23.960 --> 40:27.089
we discovered its...

40:27.160 --> 40:28.810
Symbiotic relationship.

40:28.880 --> 40:29.881
Right.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.531
Its symbiotic relationship.

40:36.880 --> 40:39.486
And no Grimm

40:39.560 --> 40:44.282
had previously been able
to make that connection.

40:44.680 --> 40:48.969
The Kinoshimobe takes those
that harm the forest.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.648
Bringing them to
feed the Jubokko.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.808
Maybe "sacrifice" is better.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.803
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
Sacrificing them.

40:55.880 --> 40:58.167
You know, I just had a thought.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.444
What if the Jubokko
took the Kinoshimobe

41:01.560 --> 41:03.642
to protect it from us?

41:04.600 --> 41:07.809
I don't know, but I've got to get back.
I'm done for tonight.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.609
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

41:11.360 --> 41:12.696
You still gonna sleep
like a baby tonight?

41:12.720 --> 41:13.767
Yep-

41:13.840 --> 41:15.251
I'm sleeping with this.

41:24.720 --> 41:27.803
No more adventures like
that while you're pregnant.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.256
Probably have to cut back a little
after the kids are born, too.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.406
Yeah.

41:33.480 --> 41:35.767
They will be adventure enough.

41:39.760 --> 41:40.761
Uh...

41:45.520 --> 41:46.521
Oh.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.000
You don't think...

41:51.080 --> 41:53.003
No, I mean, that's pine.

41:57.560 --> 41:58.976
We should probably
paint the ceiling.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.128
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Yeah.
