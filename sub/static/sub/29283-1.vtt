00:18.607 --> 00:22.206
I am
the son of Earth.

00:22.208 --> 00:26.065
A child from
the tiny planet,

00:26.067 --> 00:28.437
lost in outer space
a long time ago.

00:30.495 --> 00:32.464
I dwell beneath
the burden of time,

00:35.100 --> 00:36.635
where dreams are fruitless

00:39.271 --> 00:41.541
and all belongings
ultimately lost.

00:47.445 --> 00:48.714
I am the son of earth,

00:52.651 --> 00:54.754
where days and years pass,

00:56.621 --> 00:59.392
where the green and sweet
spring always beckons,

01:01.359 --> 01:03.362
where madness will never let go.

01:05.597 --> 01:10.402
But the moon soothes
your beloved nightmare.

01:12.671 --> 01:15.442
We've been prisoners
of this modest planet,

01:17.308 --> 01:18.477
circling the sun,

01:22.548 --> 01:27.554
always wondering what
miserable eye is watching us.

02:20.838 --> 02:23.806
Hi,
you've reached the Mayas.

02:23.808 --> 02:25.809
We're not at home right
now but that doesn't mean

02:25.811 --> 02:27.877
we don't have an alarm system.

02:27.879 --> 02:29.679
After the beep, you
can tell us everything

02:29.681 --> 02:31.347
you think about us.

02:31.349 --> 02:32.185
Mwah.

02:36.989 --> 02:37.824
Honey.

02:42.294 --> 02:43.329
Can you hear me?

02:47.765 --> 02:48.700
You can hear me.

02:51.770 --> 02:52.739
I know.

02:57.742 --> 02:58.644
I'm sorry.

03:00.312 --> 03:00.914
I'm so sorry.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.835
Pick up.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.978
Pick up the fucking thing.

03:36.548 --> 03:37.383
God!

03:42.888 --> 03:43.923
You!

03:45.356 --> 03:46.626
You sycophant!

03:47.960 --> 03:51.762
It's all your fault,
do you hear me?

03:51.764 --> 03:53.933
Everything I did, I did for us!

03:55.600 --> 03:57.270
And you wanted to bail out?

03:58.903 --> 04:00.706
Why did you just quit?!

04:01.840 --> 04:03.909
Did I get you down to me?

04:09.914 --> 04:11.850
We could have saved our family.

04:15.486 --> 04:17.257
You could have
just talked to me.

04:19.692 --> 04:20.326
No.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.730
You decided everything yourself.

04:26.064 --> 04:28.701
What else could I have done?!

04:29.834 --> 04:34.706
How could I have
reached out to you?

04:40.846 --> 04:45.851
I just wanted you
to be the same.

04:53.391 --> 04:54.026
The one...

05:00.399 --> 05:01.401
The one I...

05:08.439 --> 05:11.610
I just wanted you
to get my wife back!

06:20.978 --> 06:23.014
Where are you going?

06:23.915 --> 06:24.750
Home.

06:27.819 --> 06:28.651
Home?

06:28.653 --> 06:29.488
What does that mean?

06:30.755 --> 06:31.890
She wants me to come.

06:35.127 --> 06:37.163
Wait, you're packing
up and leaving?

06:40.031 --> 06:42.031
I left you a note.

06:42.033 --> 06:43.034
What note?

06:46.170 --> 06:47.706
Liv, wait, what's going on?

06:49.141 --> 06:49.975
Talk to me, Liv.

06:52.009 --> 06:53.045
What's going on?

06:59.685 --> 07:00.950
You know this whole time,

07:00.952 --> 07:02.118
What time?

07:02.120 --> 07:04.086
That we've been
together, I didn't work.

07:04.088 --> 07:06.156
You've been working
nonstop until now.

07:06.158 --> 07:08.858
This was supposed to
be our little vacation.

07:08.860 --> 07:09.661
I know.

07:10.995 --> 07:13.031
This has been the
best time of my life.

07:15.000 --> 07:15.899
Liv, before I met you,

07:15.901 --> 07:19.069
I didn't want anything
other than work.

07:19.071 --> 07:22.005
I didn't have anything
other than this place

07:22.007 --> 07:23.608
and my work, and that was it.

07:24.843 --> 07:27.644
Then you show up out of nowhere.

07:27.646 --> 07:28.480
And?

07:29.848 --> 07:31.451
And I was so happy.

07:32.951 --> 07:33.786
What?

07:35.019 --> 07:37.022
No, I didn't mean it like,

07:41.026 --> 07:44.226
yesterday I found out one of
my clients killed himself.

07:44.228 --> 07:47.264
I thought that happened a lot.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.100
It does.

07:49.067 --> 07:50.767
He and I have been in
touch the whole time

07:50.769 --> 07:52.034
I'd have been with Companion.

07:52.036 --> 07:54.170
And he was calling me
more than anyone else.

07:54.172 --> 07:56.305
I thought we talked
more than anyone else.

07:56.307 --> 07:59.642
He was even beginning
to call more often, god.

07:59.644 --> 08:00.212
Jeez.

08:02.113 --> 08:03.312
I thought that I got
him out of that place.

08:03.314 --> 08:06.149
He was this guy, he
wears a suit to work,

08:06.151 --> 08:08.084
he comes home, he
beats his wife!

08:08.086 --> 08:10.122
God, I thought we could change!

08:11.255 --> 08:13.223
And now you're
beating yourself up.

08:13.225 --> 08:15.858
Liv, this guy was
living a normal life.

08:15.860 --> 08:18.562
I fucking disappear and he
jumps off a fucking building!

08:18.564 --> 08:20.163
He was fucking nuts!

08:20.165 --> 08:21.766
Yeah and he's
not the only one!

08:26.137 --> 08:27.138
I'm so, Liv?

08:29.206 --> 08:30.242
Christ.

09:01.139 --> 09:03.272
Welcome to
the Companion System.

09:03.274 --> 09:06.709
Hamming Tyree, yesterday
you got three new clients

09:06.711 --> 09:09.244
from Dr. Berndhart
to take care of.

09:09.246 --> 09:12.150
You also have 28
unanswered calls.

09:16.321 --> 09:17.156
Pick up.

09:21.293 --> 09:23.028
Goddamn you, pick up!

09:24.328 --> 09:25.864
Please, pick up.

09:30.369 --> 09:32.301
Aaron
Meyer was my very first

09:32.303 --> 09:33.673
client with Companion.

09:39.144 --> 09:41.279
Now he's the first
client that I've killed.

09:45.116 --> 09:47.249
Hey listen, Aaron, how long
have we been working together?

09:47.251 --> 09:48.286
Three years?

09:49.221 --> 09:52.321
Yes, something
like that, I think.

09:52.323 --> 09:54.123
Yes, you're right.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.324
But...

09:55.326 --> 09:57.694
And, we have made
clear progress.

09:57.696 --> 09:59.699
You know, we found us a job,

10:00.432 --> 10:02.265
we managed to stick to it.

10:02.267 --> 10:03.999
Doesn't that mean something?

10:04.001 --> 10:07.302
Yes it does,
but we're talking.

10:07.304 --> 10:09.138
Do you really
want your illusions to make...

10:09.140 --> 10:11.206
It's not about
my illusions, you fucking...

10:11.208 --> 10:12.243
Excuse me?

10:13.211 --> 10:15.210
She looks
right through me

10:15.212 --> 10:17.113
as if I don't exist.

10:17.115 --> 10:18.214
She's always silent and acts

10:18.216 --> 10:19.985
like I'm fucking bitch, you see?

10:21.186 --> 10:22.919
And then makes me look
like a fucking tyrant,

10:22.921 --> 10:24.320
like I'm the psycho here.

10:24.322 --> 10:27.123
Aaron, you know that
swearing's not allowed.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.392
You taking everything
I prescribed?

10:29.394 --> 10:30.893
What
does it have to do

10:30.895 --> 10:32.328
with the fucking sedatives?

10:32.330 --> 10:34.164
It's about her.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.364
It's her, you understand?

10:35.366 --> 10:37.235
Her indifference is killing me.

10:38.937 --> 10:40.837
Aaron, you do realize
that it's not just

10:40.839 --> 10:43.238
a momentary calming effect.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.874
These drugs accumulate
in the body for months,

10:45.876 --> 10:49.411
so we really need to
complete the course, okay?

10:49.413 --> 10:51.480
It will get easier every week.

10:51.482 --> 10:54.150
Did you take your
medicine this morning?

10:54.152 --> 10:56.118
Damn, man, you're
not listening to me at all.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.323
Aaron, did you take your
medicine this morning?

11:00.057 --> 11:01.027
No.

11:02.193 --> 11:03.194
Please take it.

11:06.331 --> 11:07.296
And then press your
hand to the screen

11:07.298 --> 11:08.299
and we can continue.

11:13.437 --> 11:17.973
Patient ID8931,
drug injection is confirmed.

11:17.975 --> 11:18.943
Thank you, Aaron.

11:20.111 --> 11:21.411
You have to go
through identification

11:21.413 --> 11:23.412
for every session, okay?

11:23.414 --> 11:25.418
Otherwise we can't
achieve anything.

11:26.985 --> 11:28.153
If you feel better now,

11:30.054 --> 11:33.388
all right so we'll discuss
everything again tomorrow

11:33.390 --> 11:36.361
and for now,

11:37.294 --> 11:38.396
talk to your wife.

11:40.398 --> 11:42.464
Preferably in the
next couple of hours

11:42.466 --> 11:44.736
while the effect of the
medicine is strongest.

11:46.303 --> 11:49.875
And our appointment
tomorrow is scheduled.

11:51.308 --> 11:52.474
Deal.

11:52.476 --> 11:53.345
Okay, take care.

11:54.278 --> 11:57.881
Client
ID8931, session is over.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.916
Your rating has moved
up by 320 points.

12:00.918 --> 12:04.389
Your rating position
is 16, congratulations.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.860
Incoming call from
System Administrator.

12:10.227 --> 12:11.828
Dude,
good thing I caught you,

12:11.830 --> 12:12.962
are you home?

12:12.964 --> 12:14.164
Yeah.

12:14.166 --> 12:14.930
Have
you seen the news?

12:14.932 --> 12:15.864
No.

12:15.866 --> 12:17.533
As usual, what happened now?

12:17.535 --> 12:20.002
Some guy
claims the world is fucked

12:20.004 --> 12:23.105
but don't worry, sure,
nothing happened.

12:23.107 --> 12:26.010
Don't tell me you started
watching that zombie box.

12:27.278 --> 12:30.113
Dude,
one billion views.

12:30.115 --> 12:31.383
I'll send it to your desktop.

13:46.258 --> 13:47.891
Shh.

15:08.505 --> 15:09.973
Danger, danger.

15:47.177 --> 15:49.579
Hey Hamming, are
you too lazy to hit the road?

15:49.581 --> 15:51.748
Hi, Margaret, no, I'm working.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.616
It's
already been four weeks

15:53.618 --> 15:55.220
since I last saw you around.

16:02.659 --> 16:07.332
Incoming call
from client ID9314, Cain Sardo.

16:09.234 --> 16:10.366
Cain?

16:10.368 --> 16:11.733
Isn't our appointment
in 40 minutes

16:11.735 --> 16:13.536
or do I have it wrong?

16:13.538 --> 16:14.572
Screw this.

16:15.639 --> 16:18.306
This is bullshit, my friend.

16:18.308 --> 16:20.980
This is all bullshit.

16:22.113 --> 16:24.280
I'm sorry, what are
you talking about?

16:24.282 --> 16:27.583
I threw away what's
rest of your fucking pills!

16:27.585 --> 16:29.218
Maybe someone will
find them, huh,

16:29.220 --> 16:32.157
and start fooling around
like me after this, huh?

16:32.823 --> 16:34.390
After what?

16:34.392 --> 16:37.296
After I took
out that Spotty guy.

16:38.596 --> 16:39.728
Took out?

16:39.730 --> 16:40.765
Sorted.

16:41.765 --> 16:43.565
Took out, killed!

16:43.567 --> 16:45.370
Killed, is it clear now?

16:51.609 --> 16:53.177
Cain, let's start over.

16:55.212 --> 16:57.280
So you threw away the
medicine and then you...

16:57.282 --> 16:59.681
I'm sick, you can't
be that retarded.

16:59.683 --> 17:01.651
Walking down the sneaky street,

17:01.653 --> 17:03.652
the one with the goddamn
shop, you know, right there.

17:03.654 --> 17:06.288
This motherfucker is
walking straight at me

17:06.290 --> 17:08.458
and fucking blocking me!

17:08.460 --> 17:10.660
So only after this,
I threw them away

17:10.662 --> 17:12.361
because it's bullshit.

17:12.363 --> 17:14.566
What you're doing is bullshit.

17:22.574 --> 17:23.608
What happened next?

17:24.608 --> 17:25.443
Next?

17:26.810 --> 17:27.642
I went home.

17:27.644 --> 17:28.646
I called you.

17:31.816 --> 17:34.316
Why are you so fucking silent?

17:34.318 --> 17:35.718
I'm here.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.788
I'm sorry, I thought
you weren't finished.

17:47.598 --> 17:49.198
You shitting
yourself already?

17:49.200 --> 17:49.835
No.

17:51.036 --> 17:54.306
Cain, I just told you that
I'm waiting for you to finish.

17:56.441 --> 17:57.375
The end?

17:59.277 --> 18:02.648
What end do you want, hmm?

18:04.414 --> 18:06.414
That I gave the moron
the kiss of life

18:06.416 --> 18:08.086
and he just woke up?

18:08.819 --> 18:10.186
I don't know.

18:10.188 --> 18:11.420
He must still be lying in there,

18:11.422 --> 18:12.854
they don't pick up
the bodies nowadays.

18:12.856 --> 18:15.324
They're just lying
around for days!

18:19.564 --> 18:21.500
Why did you throw
away your medicine?

18:22.767 --> 18:23.802
What's that to you?

18:25.603 --> 18:28.740
How long am I supposed
to gobble them up, hmm?

18:30.407 --> 18:32.408
I'm acting like a
shithead hooked on them

18:32.410 --> 18:35.178
talking to you for
days, and for nothing!

18:35.180 --> 18:39.384
Spotty is the fucker and
I should take the pills?!

18:45.623 --> 18:46.792
You dried out?

18:51.962 --> 18:53.164
You better watch yourself.

18:55.833 --> 18:59.401
You're

18:59.403 --> 19:01.237
Cain, let's talk
about your state, what...

19:01.239 --> 19:02.473
Fucking asshole!

19:05.777 --> 19:06.812
Session is over.

20:41.873 --> 20:44.407
Hey, where are you?

20:44.409 --> 20:48.009
Just by the
railway station.

20:48.011 --> 20:48.813
You okay?

20:50.914 --> 20:53.415
Do you want me to come?

20:53.417 --> 20:54.449
No need.

20:54.451 --> 20:55.921
Save your crazies.

20:59.923 --> 21:01.626
You're kind of one
of my psychos too.

21:02.993 --> 21:05.029
I am not gonna
jump off the roof.

21:07.731 --> 21:10.868
What the hell is
going on around here?

21:13.971 --> 21:14.903
I don't know.

21:14.905 --> 21:15.906
I really don't care right now.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.442
I'm okay, isn't that
what you wanted to know?

21:20.444 --> 21:21.279
Stop.

21:22.512 --> 21:23.615
I'm worried about you.

21:27.984 --> 21:29.788
Well I can't talk right now.

21:34.025 --> 21:36.328
We've become
what you're afraid of, Liv.

21:37.729 --> 21:38.930
Just like everyone else.

21:40.731 --> 21:44.435
Always fighting, hurting
the ones we love the most.

21:47.070 --> 21:48.539
Why do we do that?

21:49.773 --> 21:50.975
Why did we change?

21:55.546 --> 22:00.449
Incoming call from
client ID 10017, Liv Uster.

22:00.451 --> 22:01.750
Hello, Liv.

22:01.752 --> 22:04.386
Hello, how are you?

22:04.388 --> 22:05.823
I think that's my question.

22:06.824 --> 22:09.057
Mine too.

22:09.059 --> 22:10.558
Things are good.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.061
Today was productive.

22:12.063 --> 22:13.528
Right before you
called I was talking

22:13.530 --> 22:15.898
to a pretty difficult client

22:15.900 --> 22:17.336
but that happens.

22:18.536 --> 22:20.102
You know,
I tasted an apple.

22:20.104 --> 22:21.703
A real one.

22:21.705 --> 22:23.838
It's more sour than applesauce

22:23.840 --> 22:25.908
but there's something about it.

22:25.910 --> 22:27.509
Have you tried one?

22:27.511 --> 22:28.677
No, never.

22:28.679 --> 22:30.578
I will
show you the place.

22:30.580 --> 22:32.350
We definitely have to go there.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.987
By the way I had a dream
about you last night.

22:38.055 --> 22:38.890
Tell me.

25:20.851 --> 25:24.189
That girl, I
thought I knew her.

25:25.690 --> 25:28.623
In my dream you were so lonely.

25:28.625 --> 25:29.691
You know I had a feeling...

25:29.693 --> 25:32.026
Liv?

25:32.028 --> 25:33.261
Hey Liv?

25:33.263 --> 25:34.865
Liv, can you hear me?

25:36.067 --> 25:37.102
Liv, are you there?

25:52.349 --> 25:54.752
Welcome to
Companion Operating System.

25:57.755 --> 26:02.127
You have a new message
from ID10017, Liv Uster.

26:13.371 --> 26:15.671
Due to technical
malfunctions your rating

26:15.673 --> 26:16.674
couldn't be counted.

26:48.239 --> 26:50.171
How did you get here?

26:50.173 --> 26:51.375
Don't look at me!

26:53.076 --> 26:55.076
I just came in.

26:55.078 --> 26:58.113
How the hell did
you get in here?!

26:58.115 --> 27:00.048
I used a key.

27:00.050 --> 27:01.350
Can I?

27:01.352 --> 27:02.354
What?!

27:03.287 --> 27:04.355
Why are you shouting?

27:09.926 --> 27:11.160
Oh.

27:11.162 --> 27:12.227
I'm not shouting.

27:22.306 --> 27:23.341
All right.

27:26.343 --> 27:27.409
What have we got here?

27:27.411 --> 27:29.180
Oh hello you, okay.

27:53.403 --> 27:55.470
Damn, that's good shit!

27:55.472 --> 27:58.039
Holy moly, where'd you
get this from, Johnny?

27:58.041 --> 27:59.040
Yeah.

27:59.042 --> 27:59.877
Oh!

28:01.746 --> 28:03.344
Yo, how's Johnny doing?

28:03.346 --> 28:04.313
Doing good?

28:04.315 --> 28:05.213
I haven't seen him since,

28:05.215 --> 28:07.482
what was that, the
building out there.

28:09.086 --> 28:11.990
Ooh, hey, here comes my bike.

28:14.325 --> 28:17.226
This is the
police, open the door.

28:19.430 --> 28:21.764
Fuck that, fuck, shit!

28:21.766 --> 28:23.865
What, you think I
brought them here?

28:23.867 --> 28:25.736
You, that
psycho douche bag.

28:27.037 --> 28:28.437
Fuck!

28:28.439 --> 28:30.939
He turned me in, the bastard.

28:30.941 --> 28:32.440
Open the fucking door.

28:32.442 --> 28:33.342
I'm gonna find him

28:33.344 --> 28:35.447
and I'm gonna skin
him like a squirrel!

28:37.480 --> 28:40.982
Police, open the door.

28:44.054 --> 28:47.922
Why?

28:47.924 --> 28:49.760
Open the door.

28:54.030 --> 28:56.198
Welcome to
Paradise Gardens Mansion.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.498
For identification,

28:57.500 --> 29:00.001
please place your
finger on the panel.

29:00.003 --> 29:01.370
An error occurred.

29:01.372 --> 29:02.373
Please try again.

29:07.144 --> 29:08.544
An error occurred.

29:08.546 --> 29:10.411
You have one last try.

29:10.413 --> 29:13.317
Or enter a digital signature
right on the panel.

29:20.023 --> 29:20.924
Welcome, Liv.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.034
Is anybody at home?

29:32.036 --> 29:33.371
No.

31:33.257 --> 31:34.525
Welcome, my girl.

31:41.131 --> 31:42.430
Hurry up.

31:42.432 --> 31:43.233
It's dinner time.

32:00.651 --> 32:03.688
Okey dokey girls,
everything's ready.

32:28.644 --> 32:30.615
Kerry and I want to leave.

32:35.652 --> 32:36.621
Far away from here.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.020
Great.

32:39.022 --> 32:40.657
I'll help you with packing.

32:41.592 --> 32:43.725
We knew that you'd
love this idea.

32:43.727 --> 32:45.526
That's why we decided
to say goodbye

32:45.528 --> 32:47.999
in a close family
circle without fighting.

32:50.067 --> 32:52.299
That doesn't sound like you.

32:52.301 --> 32:54.669
And he never would
have thought of this.

32:54.671 --> 32:56.337
What's the catch?

32:56.339 --> 32:58.208
For god's sake, just relax.

33:07.116 --> 33:09.453
Let's just drink,
really, Kerry.

33:41.617 --> 33:43.617
Honey, call the Doctor Hughes.

34:00.804 --> 34:02.273
Pick up, Liv.

34:07.611 --> 34:08.780
Liv, please pick up.

34:16.753 --> 34:18.556
I remember the first day we met.

34:20.157 --> 34:21.626
The day that my shell cracked

34:25.661 --> 34:29.099
and I was reborn for you.

35:08.304 --> 35:10.604
Welcome to the
Unified City Taxi Service.

35:10.606 --> 35:12.507
We are sorry to inform
you that your points

35:12.509 --> 35:14.376
have expired as you
haven't used our service

35:14.378 --> 35:17.878
for two years, three months,
22 days and 16 hours.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.880
Please choose the
preferred service option

35:19.882 --> 35:22.650
and say order to order
a taxi to your location.

35:22.652 --> 35:23.487
Order.

35:38.467 --> 35:39.703
Good evening.

35:50.581 --> 35:51.414
Silent.

35:59.322 --> 36:00.290
That's good.

36:30.353 --> 36:31.188
Fuck you!

36:34.791 --> 36:35.990
Immigrants.

36:35.992 --> 36:39.628
They throw themselves under
the wheels like rats, you know.

36:39.630 --> 36:42.463
I tell you what, we're
all like rats here.

36:42.465 --> 36:43.664
It's filled to the brim.

36:43.666 --> 36:45.802
People are packed like
sardines in a can.

36:46.836 --> 36:48.769
10 billion people!

36:48.771 --> 36:53.311
Hah, I mean it just blows
your fucking mind, doesn't it?

36:55.778 --> 36:58.345
When I was your
age, this blue ball

36:58.347 --> 37:00.882
had enough problems
taking seven billion

37:00.884 --> 37:01.751
under the sun.

37:03.954 --> 37:04.755
And now?

37:07.757 --> 37:11.959
There are people on this planet
as far as the eye can see.

37:11.961 --> 37:14.364
I mean enough is enough,
don't you think so?

37:15.632 --> 37:16.597
Yeah.

37:16.599 --> 37:17.432
- Huh?
- Yeah.

37:17.434 --> 37:18.365
Yeah.

37:18.367 --> 37:19.570
Just look at them.

37:25.474 --> 37:27.877
30 years ago they all
dreamt of a new life

37:29.713 --> 37:32.012
of European security.

37:37.019 --> 37:42.025
They wanted a free ride
on a brand new Noah's Ark.

37:49.599 --> 37:51.335
Now there's no difference.

37:54.338 --> 37:55.573
East or west.

38:00.844 --> 38:03.047
Same shit everywhere.

38:22.833 --> 38:24.468
This is as far as I can go.

38:25.802 --> 38:27.135
Hey!

38:27.137 --> 38:27.972
Are you sleeping?

38:28.972 --> 38:31.072
Judging by the compass,

38:31.074 --> 38:34.075
it's not far at all.

38:34.077 --> 38:35.613
But you're on your own now.

39:51.588 --> 39:52.390
Liv?

40:12.141 --> 40:13.608
City
Emergency Service.

40:13.610 --> 40:15.209
Please state your
full name and ID.

40:15.211 --> 40:18.847
Hamming Tyree, ID, ah
shit I don't remember.

40:18.849 --> 40:19.813
Please state your ID

40:19.815 --> 40:21.081
or we won't be able to help you.

40:21.083 --> 40:22.018
Give me a second.

40:26.155 --> 40:28.759
Okay, ID 91W8055A

40:30.793 --> 40:32.494
and 256 at the end.

40:32.496 --> 40:36.063
State the reason
for your call, Mr. Tyree.

40:36.065 --> 40:39.133
My girlfriend, she's
not picking up her phone.

40:39.135 --> 40:40.001
Tell us
the approximate time

40:40.003 --> 40:42.202
since your last
communication with her.

40:42.204 --> 40:43.037
Four.

40:43.039 --> 40:44.237
No, 4:30.

40:44.239 --> 40:47.108
Mr. Tyree, do you
understand what's going on?

40:47.110 --> 40:49.077
There are no available
groups currently.

40:49.079 --> 40:51.144
In any case, missing
persons reports

40:51.146 --> 40:52.847
can only be filed
after five days.

40:52.849 --> 40:54.249
There are no available groups.

40:54.251 --> 40:55.249
No, you don't understand.

40:55.251 --> 40:56.219
She might need help.

40:58.021 --> 40:59.920
Everyone
needs help right now.

40:59.922 --> 41:02.757
Mr. Tyree, is there anything
else I can do for you?

41:02.759 --> 41:04.659
Yeah, yeah you
could fucking help me

41:04.661 --> 41:05.927
is what you could do.

41:05.929 --> 41:07.295
Mr. Tyree,
I have provided you

41:07.297 --> 41:09.097
with all the information I can

41:09.099 --> 41:10.764
with regard to your claim.

41:10.766 --> 41:12.733
Please contact us
after five days

41:12.735 --> 41:14.536
from the moment the
person went missing.

41:14.538 --> 41:16.037
If there's an
available response team

41:16.039 --> 41:17.070
we'll contact you.

41:17.072 --> 41:18.238
Goodbye.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.907
Don't you fucking
hang up on me!

41:19.909 --> 41:22.245
Don't fucking hang up on me!

41:33.222 --> 41:34.592
Where are you?

41:36.592 --> 41:38.895
It's not enough knowing
that you're out there.

41:41.931 --> 41:43.099
I have to see you again.

41:48.137 --> 41:50.273
To know that you are real.

42:07.289 --> 42:09.793
You said you had a
wolf howl in your dream.

42:14.697 --> 42:16.266
The howling means loneliness.

42:18.934 --> 42:20.834
But I can't understand
if it refers

42:20.836 --> 42:24.208
to you or to me, since
I have run away to him.

42:26.175 --> 42:27.210
But we have us.

42:28.177 --> 42:30.311
That means the dream was wrong.

42:30.313 --> 42:33.113
No, you don't understand.

42:33.115 --> 42:37.084
I think you've forgotten
who it is you're talking to.

42:37.086 --> 42:40.220
No.

42:40.222 --> 42:41.289
Please, let me go.

42:41.291 --> 42:42.960
Come on.

42:44.126 --> 42:45.293
You're so innocent.

42:45.295 --> 42:46.760
Stop it, it's not funny.

42:46.762 --> 42:48.132
Please stop it.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.166
Don't play so sweet.

42:52.168 --> 42:53.269
I know you like it.

42:55.137 --> 42:56.340
Enough, stop!

43:01.110 --> 43:02.043
I'm so sorry.

43:02.045 --> 43:02.976
Don't treat me like a child.

43:02.978 --> 43:04.646
I thought you liked it.

43:04.648 --> 43:06.250
If I say stop, please stop it.

43:13.856 --> 43:14.858
You just thought so.

43:29.304 --> 43:30.304
Hey, hey, did you get it?

43:30.306 --> 43:32.706
Thank you so much.

43:32.708 --> 43:33.643
Yeah, one second.

43:39.849 --> 43:40.751
Okay, I'm ready.

43:41.951 --> 43:46.787
18th White Road, house 132.

43:46.789 --> 43:47.954
Man, thank you so much.

43:47.956 --> 43:50.358
Yeah, you're not
gonna get in trouble?

43:50.360 --> 43:51.327
Okay, I owe you one.

44:00.235 --> 44:01.235
This
is the best route

44:01.237 --> 44:03.271
to your destination.

44:03.273 --> 44:06.273
Next train to the 18th
White Road will departure

44:06.275 --> 44:07.310
at 11:10 a.m.

44:35.271 --> 44:37.738
Hello, sir, excuse me.

44:37.740 --> 44:39.273
Do you have room for one more?

44:39.275 --> 44:40.978
Can you give me a ride please?

44:42.112 --> 44:43.681
I just need to
get to the subway.

44:44.748 --> 44:45.382
I could pay you.

44:46.916 --> 44:48.782
I can smell junkies
like you a mile away.

44:48.784 --> 44:50.418
Get the fuck off the car.

44:50.420 --> 44:52.423
Sir, I need your help.

44:53.922 --> 44:55.356
Please.

44:55.358 --> 44:57.358
My girlfriend, I've been trying
to reach her all morning.

44:57.360 --> 44:58.793
Are you dumb?

44:58.795 --> 45:00.193
I said fuck off, get off
me and my family now,

45:00.195 --> 45:01.331
you drugged up bastard!

45:13.443 --> 45:15.746
Hey man, help me.

45:18.547 --> 45:21.851
You there, help me
get up, won't you?

45:26.922 --> 45:27.921
Where's your phone?

45:27.923 --> 45:28.759
In the car.

45:31.795 --> 45:33.126
Okay I'm gonna call
you an ambulance.

45:33.128 --> 45:35.331
Just don't move too much, okay?

45:36.465 --> 45:38.034
No please, don't go away.

45:39.302 --> 45:40.304
There's no signal.

45:41.204 --> 45:42.403
Please don't leave me here,

45:42.405 --> 45:43.436
you're all heartless beasts!

45:45.842 --> 45:50.380
Yeah.

46:55.010 --> 46:56.543
Thanks for the jacket, buddy.

47:02.085 --> 47:02.920
Whoo!

47:04.186 --> 47:05.021
Hey Ian!

47:34.951 --> 47:35.586
Oh Ian!

47:43.492 --> 47:44.527
Ian!

47:47.230 --> 47:48.065
Hmmm.

47:56.606 --> 47:59.977
Hey, pull this thing,
fucking irritating.

48:03.045 --> 48:04.513
What do we got here?

48:06.548 --> 48:07.550
Any money?

48:09.985 --> 48:10.621
In the phone.

48:13.356 --> 48:15.058
Why didn't you
steal his finger?

48:17.025 --> 48:18.626
Ah, we...

48:18.628 --> 48:19.459
What?!

48:19.461 --> 48:20.293
We can go back.

48:20.295 --> 48:22.365
What the fuck,
are you retarded?

48:23.498 --> 48:25.668
You think we're
gonna go back there?

48:27.637 --> 48:28.472
Okay.

48:30.572 --> 48:32.405
Hey, Cain.

48:32.407 --> 48:33.974
Huh?

48:33.976 --> 48:36.445
We have loads of
his fingerprints.

48:37.646 --> 48:39.612
We can just print his finger

48:39.614 --> 48:43.052
on a 3D bioprinter.

48:45.355 --> 48:46.188
Ah.

48:48.391 --> 48:50.159
Yet you are a genius.

48:51.760 --> 48:53.563
I keep you around for something.

49:02.170 --> 49:03.005
No!

49:04.239 --> 49:06.340
Here he is, motherfucker!

49:06.342 --> 49:07.575
Who?

49:07.577 --> 49:10.244
Who yes, that
psycho douche bag!

49:10.246 --> 49:13.613
I always believed in karma!

49:13.615 --> 49:15.282
We fucking got him.

49:15.284 --> 49:16.583
What else is in the bag?

49:16.585 --> 49:17.684
What's in the fucking bag?

49:17.686 --> 49:19.253
We have his location.

49:19.255 --> 49:20.554
Fucking a right!

49:20.556 --> 49:22.555
Next train
to the 18th White Road

49:22.557 --> 49:24.657
departure at 11:10 a.m.

49:24.659 --> 49:27.728
Come on!

49:27.730 --> 49:29.030
Fucking a right!

49:29.032 --> 49:29.666
Whoo!

50:34.396 --> 50:35.829
Fuck!

50:35.831 --> 50:37.733
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

50:39.768 --> 50:41.270
That son of a bitch, right?

50:42.871 --> 50:43.672
No big deal.

50:46.509 --> 50:48.876
I mean we know where
he's going, right?

50:48.878 --> 50:50.577
Yes we know where he's going

50:50.579 --> 50:52.315
but what then, what after
he gets off the train?

50:53.682 --> 50:55.648
This is all your fault.

50:55.650 --> 50:57.586
You're so fat, dumb and slow!

51:00.322 --> 51:01.822
- He's just far.
- Fuck!

51:01.824 --> 51:03.891
He can't go far, right?

51:03.893 --> 51:06.327
Yes he can go far,
he's on a train!

51:06.329 --> 51:08.662
We'll get on the
train right after it.

51:08.664 --> 51:11.735
25 minutes later, he
could be anywhere by then!

51:17.806 --> 51:18.707
Fuck you!

51:20.842 --> 51:21.876
Dumbass!

51:21.878 --> 51:22.711
How?

51:45.635 --> 51:48.171
This isn't a dream.

51:49.672 --> 51:50.440
I'm not asleep.

51:54.309 --> 51:56.579
We got lost somewhere
between the borders.

53:06.548 --> 53:08.884
We have to find our way back

53:10.485 --> 53:11.754
and cross over.

53:23.532 --> 53:25.766
We're now
arriving at New Corby

53:25.768 --> 53:27.967
which will be our
final destination.

53:27.969 --> 53:29.271
All change please.

54:01.871 --> 54:02.905
Hey!

54:03.972 --> 54:04.974
Come on, in the car!

54:29.364 --> 54:30.898
Hold the wheel.

54:30.900 --> 54:31.735
Hmm?

54:32.867 --> 54:34.304
Hold the wheel.

54:40.943 --> 54:44.912
What the hell do you
want from that guy?

54:44.914 --> 54:47.484
Maybe it wasn't even him
who called the police.

54:48.583 --> 54:49.719
You don't believe me?

54:52.355 --> 54:53.954
I'm on a hunt for
blood right now, buddy,

54:53.956 --> 54:55.925
so it's either you or him!

54:57.460 --> 54:58.925
You're right here
so it makes my job

54:58.927 --> 54:59.992
a lot easier doesn't it?

54:59.994 --> 55:00.763
Yeah, yeah.

55:01.963 --> 55:03.130
Got it?

55:03.132 --> 55:03.967
Yeah.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.036
Jesus.

55:24.085 --> 55:25.519
Hey!

55:25.521 --> 55:26.887
Hey, can you?

55:26.889 --> 55:27.920
Can you stop?

55:27.922 --> 55:29.055
Hey!

55:29.057 --> 55:30.092
Hey, stop!

55:40.603 --> 55:42.171
I can barely remember
what love is.

55:46.041 --> 55:46.943
Was it love?

55:50.713 --> 55:52.082
Did love bring you to me?

55:56.184 --> 55:57.887
Or something else?

56:17.972 --> 56:19.476
It was the same.

56:21.943 --> 56:23.476
- Its okay.
- The same.

56:23.478 --> 56:25.479
It's okay, I'm here.

56:25.481 --> 56:27.384
I'm here, I've got you.

56:31.786 --> 56:32.621
It's okay.

56:57.146 --> 56:58.144
Let me go!

57:01.083 --> 57:01.918
Let me go!

57:48.898 --> 57:49.731
Hey!

57:54.536 --> 57:55.704
What are you, retarded?

57:57.806 --> 58:00.210
What, you piss yourself, really?

58:01.844 --> 58:02.976
What?

58:02.978 --> 58:04.481
No, it wasn't me.

58:05.748 --> 58:06.782
So it must be you.

58:15.157 --> 58:16.155
Ian.

58:16.157 --> 58:18.025
For fuck's sake, it wasn't me!

58:18.027 --> 58:18.862
Ian!

58:21.730 --> 58:22.565
Help me!

58:23.898 --> 58:25.167
It's a kid, Cain!

58:27.068 --> 58:27.936
What's your name?

58:28.903 --> 58:30.037
Leave her alone!

58:30.039 --> 58:31.241
Shut up, what's your name?

58:32.574 --> 58:33.606
Eva.

58:33.608 --> 58:35.108
I'm Ian.

58:35.110 --> 58:36.909
What, shut up!

58:36.911 --> 58:37.844
Just shut up!

58:37.846 --> 58:38.681
Shut up!

59:16.351 --> 59:17.152
Hello?

59:21.190 --> 59:23.889
Miss, do you know where
the Uster family lives?

59:34.068 --> 59:35.904
Thank you.

01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:01.424
Oh shit!

01:02:01.115 --> 01:02:01.951
Come on!

01:02:03.851 --> 01:02:05.485
Stumbling, come on.

01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:08.354
Jesus, before it fucking blows!

01:02:08.356 --> 01:02:10.092
I was looking for this.

01:02:12.193 --> 01:02:13.028
Thanks.

01:02:16.431 --> 01:02:18.498
Jesus Christ!

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.969
My fucking car!

01:02:21.335 --> 01:02:23.503
My fucking car, look at it!

01:02:23.505 --> 01:02:24.304
Just look at this!

01:02:24.306 --> 01:02:25.407
Do you see what we did?

01:02:26.507 --> 01:02:27.307
See what you did?

01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:28.575
We're in the
middle of nowhere.

01:02:28.577 --> 01:02:30.813
Okay, what do you wanna do?

01:02:31.813 --> 01:02:33.449
What do you wanna do?!

01:02:36.117 --> 01:02:37.420
We're gonna walk.

01:02:38.353 --> 01:02:39.351
That's what the
fuck we're gonna do.

01:02:39.353 --> 01:02:40.355
Then let's walk.

01:03:23.898 --> 01:03:26.633

01:14:46.814 --> 01:14:49.014
What was I like?

01:14:49.016 --> 01:14:50.982
In my dream?

01:14:50.984 --> 01:14:52.054
Mhmm.

01:14:53.253 --> 01:14:54.256
Amazing.

01:14:57.324 --> 01:14:58.760
I was swimming in a river

01:15:00.761 --> 01:15:02.530
and there was a
harp at the bottom.

01:15:03.698 --> 01:15:05.801
I kept trying and
trying to get to it

01:15:07.335 --> 01:15:08.800
but I couldn't.

01:15:08.802 --> 01:15:11.102
You know how it is in dreams.

01:15:11.104 --> 01:15:14.108
And then somehow I
finally got to it

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:17.643
and I pull it up to the surface

01:15:17.645 --> 01:15:18.847
and I swam to shore

01:15:20.081 --> 01:15:21.048
and there you were.

01:15:22.583 --> 01:15:23.316
And I knew from the
moment I saw you

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:24.820
that you could play it for me.

01:15:26.287 --> 01:15:30.659
But right then, I
heard this wolf howl.

01:15:33.728 --> 01:15:37.733
Actually it was the sound
of a wounded animal.

01:15:38.899 --> 01:15:41.135
And when I looked
back, you were gone.

01:15:45.139 --> 01:15:47.839
You think
it's a miracle?

01:15:47.841 --> 01:15:50.977
Which part exactly?

01:15:50.979 --> 01:15:51.914
Us.

01:19:52.319 --> 01:19:54.255
And being
the son of earth,

01:19:55.456 --> 01:19:57.159
one among the countless,

01:19:58.525 --> 01:20:00.561
I too throw my verse
to the infinite.

01:20:02.162 --> 01:20:05.496
I send it to the creatures
with flesh or without

01:20:05.498 --> 01:20:07.101
that live in other worlds.

01:20:11.238 --> 01:20:13.507
I don't know if this
cry will reach its mark,

01:20:15.909 --> 01:20:17.311
nor what star will carry it,

01:20:19.212 --> 01:20:22.317
but if they have ever
felt love and sorrow,

01:20:23.216 --> 01:20:24.819
if they have ever dreamed,

01:20:26.487 --> 01:20:28.856
if they have starved
for understanding,

01:20:30.591 --> 01:20:33.361
following that light
burning far away,

01:20:35.529 --> 01:20:37.899
they will recognize the
passion of my breath,

01:20:39.966 --> 01:20:42.069
and the earthly
yearning in my voice.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.577
Rulers of the universe,

01:20:50.978 --> 01:20:53.047
spirits of light and darkness,

01:20:55.181 --> 01:20:57.484
surely you too
must guard the hope

01:21:00.054 --> 01:21:01.456
that one day we'll be together.
