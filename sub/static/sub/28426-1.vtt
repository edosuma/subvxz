01:51.227 --> 01:52.462
Fuck.

02:00.236 --> 02:01.571
Where are you?

02:55.857 --> 02:57.527
Where's my dad?

03:34.563 --> 03:36.298
I have what you want.

03:37.666 --> 03:38.668
Now let him go.

03:39.934 --> 03:42.037
Hey. Give it to me.

04:00.422 --> 04:01.824
<i>It's Martin, right?</i>

04:02.658 --> 04:03.893
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

04:05.059 --> 04:06.461
You seem a little uncomfortable
sitting here with us.

04:06.729 --> 04:08.498
I am, a little.

04:10.031 --> 04:12.368
What can you tell us
about EquivoCorp?

04:12.868 --> 04:13.903
The abstract.

04:16.071 --> 04:17.971
The abstract of it...

04:17.973 --> 04:21.444
EquivoCorp is an MNE whose
primary assets range across

04:21.875 --> 04:24.614
real estate, hotel groups,
and logistics.

04:25.381 --> 04:26.616
And?

04:26.848 --> 04:28.814
And they recently acquired
the start-up Crash,

04:28.816 --> 04:32.519
which developed an algorithm to
optimize short-term rental software.

04:32.521 --> 04:34.090
You think it was a wise choice?

04:36.023 --> 04:39.028
Hedging their bets, while keeping
their competition off scent...

04:39.795 --> 04:41.963
- seems smart to me.
- To me, as well.

04:42.564 --> 04:43.732
- Yes, sir, and...
- For me...

04:44.432 --> 04:46.899
as well, Mr. Duran.

04:46.901 --> 04:47.836
It's Duran.

04:50.138 --> 04:52.441
Which is why
I was so surprised

04:52.840 --> 04:57.379
when this poorly written novel
filtered across my desk yesterday.

04:58.013 --> 05:01.047
I'm sorry. Now, my job is
BSA compliance.

05:01.049 --> 05:02.682
I did an exhaustive
risk analysis...

05:02.684 --> 05:04.951
Hide all you want
behind your compliance shield

05:04.953 --> 05:07.821
and your patriotic
anti-money laundering jargon.

05:07.823 --> 05:11.690
What I want to know is what
exactly was going through your head

05:11.692 --> 05:13.894
when you filed this report
and made it impossible

05:13.896 --> 05:18.701
for a company with revenue exceeding
7 billion to do business with us.

05:19.535 --> 05:20.937
No jargon!

05:22.437 --> 05:23.872
Too many blind alleys.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.743
I was seeing payments coming from
and going into encrypted accounts.

05:27.942 --> 05:30.009
- I mean, I could show you in the report.
- Bernard.

05:30.011 --> 05:32.612
This is as much my fault
as it is Martin's.

05:32.614 --> 05:35.551
I demand a culture of complete
compliance in my department.

05:35.817 --> 05:39.185
Martin was doing the job that you hired
him to do and the one I expect him to do.

05:39.187 --> 05:41.454
Let me make myself clear
to the two of you.

05:41.456 --> 05:43.923
You weren't hired because
I want you here.

05:43.925 --> 05:47.961
You were hired because we had to,
we were forced to, to remain in business.

05:47.963 --> 05:51.400
You're a necessary evil at best.
You're radiation therapy.

05:51.934 --> 05:54.570
- That's better than being cancer.
- Martin.

05:58.172 --> 05:59.775
We're done.

06:02.044 --> 06:03.412
Ms. Whiting, please stay.

06:07.482 --> 06:08.850
Thank you, Mr. Duran.

06:15.657 --> 06:17.223
<i>Where did you find this kid?</i>

06:17.225 --> 06:19.559
<i>I can't decide whether he's
a complete idiot</i>

06:19.561 --> 06:21.694
- <i>or some kind of savant.</i>
- Fuck you.

06:21.696 --> 06:24.564
<i>Summa and Phi Beta
Kappa at Williams College, 2010.</i>

06:24.566 --> 06:26.001
<i>Top of his class at Wharton.</i>

06:26.567 --> 06:28.535
<i>First-round draft pick
on Wall Street,</i>

06:28.537 --> 06:32.271
<i>had serious offers from UBS,
Goldman, Merrill, BlackRock.</i>

06:32.273 --> 06:35.007
<i>Turned down a lot of money
to work here in AML.</i>

06:35.009 --> 06:36.711
<i>So you've weaponized autism?</i>

06:37.011 --> 06:38.513
<i>You could say that.</i>

06:38.814 --> 06:40.482
<i>But he's our weapon.</i>

06:42.050 --> 06:42.951
<i>And you have him aimed
directly at our balance sheet.</i>

06:44.186 --> 06:46.656
<i>This is serious, and we need
to do something about it.</i>

06:47.222 --> 06:49.656
<i>He's got to go, Robin.
He's got to go.</i>

06:49.658 --> 06:52.562
<i>Bernard, I hear you.
But there's another option.</i>

06:53.127 --> 06:54.793
Hey, Martin.

06:54.795 --> 06:56.932
Sorry. Robin needs to see you
in her office.

07:00.102 --> 07:01.768
Shit.

07:01.770 --> 07:03.105
Leverage? What,
are you kidding me?

07:04.372 --> 07:06.074
No, we're not calling the FBI.
We're paying them to go away.

07:07.475 --> 07:10.846
Oh, come on. Remember, these are
kids in their parents' basements.

07:12.948 --> 07:15.952
No, it's in everybody's best interest
to avoid federal involvement.

07:17.052 --> 07:18.087
Okay.

07:18.886 --> 07:20.189
What did he say?

07:21.989 --> 07:24.192
- What you drawing?
- A unicorn.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.726
It's good. I like it.

07:27.728 --> 07:30.230
Okay, well, you know what? Just tell him
I have to call him back 'cause... No!

07:30.232 --> 07:32.598
No, absolutely not.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.802
Tell him not to pay a single dime
until I'm in the room negotiating.

07:35.804 --> 07:37.670
Your mom's gonna yell at me.

07:37.672 --> 07:38.874
Fine.

07:39.641 --> 07:41.677
Hey, Cindy.
Could you come in here, please?

07:42.210 --> 07:44.711
Hey, could please take Molly
to the kitchen for a snack?

07:44.713 --> 07:46.082
Of course. Come on, Molly.

07:47.816 --> 07:50.152
Hey, fist bump.
I'll see you later.

07:51.086 --> 07:52.952
Hey, no sugar.

07:52.954 --> 07:54.689
Let's go get you a snack.

07:59.627 --> 08:02.130
$10,000 a year
for art lessons.

08:03.631 --> 08:04.934
You know what this is?

08:06.067 --> 08:07.269
It's a unicorn.

08:11.105 --> 08:12.307
Like you.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.610
You did the right thing,
Martin.

08:15.076 --> 08:16.745
It took real guts
to do what you did.

08:17.345 --> 08:18.881
Then what's the catch?

08:19.948 --> 08:23.016
They're reassigning you
to a local branch...

08:23.018 --> 08:25.121
- temporarily.
- Well, that's subtle.

08:27.088 --> 08:28.324
Where are they sending me?

08:30.191 --> 08:31.626
Elba, New York.

08:33.828 --> 08:35.761
You know that's where I grew up.

08:35.764 --> 08:37.600
Two birds with one stone,
Martin.

08:37.899 --> 08:40.866
The AML officer there is taking
early retirement, health reasons.

08:40.868 --> 08:43.802
You know the area. You'll have an
easier time orienting yourself.

08:43.804 --> 08:45.337
This is political exile.

08:45.339 --> 08:47.307
Oh, come on,
it can't be that bad.

08:47.309 --> 08:50.246
It's so bad they sent Napoleon
to the other Elba.

08:52.179 --> 08:53.583
You still have family there?

08:53.949 --> 08:54.983
Yeah.

09:00.921 --> 09:03.423
Well, I'm sure they'll be thrilled
to hear about your return.

09:03.425 --> 09:06.728
Oh, yeah. Just thrilled.

09:07.762 --> 09:09.696
<i>When do I have to be there?</i>

09:09.698 --> 09:11.601
<i>About five minutes
after that meeting ended.</i>

09:12.700 --> 09:14.035
<i>Little advice from a friend?</i>

09:14.902 --> 09:16.104
Less is more.

09:16.838 --> 09:18.040
Got it?

09:18.305 --> 09:19.742
Yeah.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.112
<i>Good.</i>

09:25.447 --> 09:27.183
Don't go around me again.

09:30.251 --> 09:32.988
<i>...sold
our children into slavery.</i>

09:33.387 --> 09:34.790
<i>For what?</i>

10:00.281 --> 10:03.819
Okay, I just need
you to sign right here for this.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.517
All right,
see you next time, bro.

10:37.519 --> 10:38.988
Great. See you.

10:42.958 --> 10:45.124
Why is this thing asking me
for Bitcoin?

10:45.126 --> 10:47.025
You actually take
Bitcoin here?

10:47.027 --> 10:49.798
Absolutely.
I prefer it over cash.

10:50.397 --> 10:51.831
Why?

10:51.833 --> 10:54.433
Because it's fast,
cheap to use,

10:54.435 --> 10:57.372
it's private, and central
governments can't take it away.

10:58.173 --> 11:00.443
Look, I just want to convert
plastic to paper.

11:00.876 --> 11:03.942
Paper gets me alcohol,
and the alcohol gives me a nice buzz.

11:03.944 --> 11:07.116
Be honest. How many people in this
town even know what Bitcoin is?

11:07.348 --> 11:09.017
Good things take time.

11:09.483 --> 11:10.819
Earl.

11:13.221 --> 11:14.453
Holy...

11:14.455 --> 11:16.057
Marty Duran?

11:16.525 --> 11:19.194
What's up, man?
What are you doing here?

11:20.227 --> 11:22.061
No, I mean what the fuck
are you doing back here?

11:22.063 --> 11:24.433
I thought you were some kind
of big-shot banker in the city.

11:25.467 --> 11:26.901
It's a long story.

11:27.301 --> 11:29.137
- What are you doing here?
- Forget it.

11:29.570 --> 11:32.173
Oh, hey, sorry
for the inconvenience.

11:34.309 --> 11:35.477
It's...

11:36.343 --> 11:39.314
It's mine.
My dad left it to me.

11:40.048 --> 11:41.917
He died a couple years
after high school.

11:42.383 --> 11:45.019
- I had no idea.
- Why would you?

11:45.319 --> 11:47.055
Hated this place growing up.

11:48.390 --> 11:50.092
Remember when we used
to steal beer?

11:50.858 --> 11:53.094
No, man. I remember when
we stole a bottle of whiskey.

11:53.862 --> 11:55.427
You remember which kind?

11:55.429 --> 11:57.165
Oh, I'll never forget.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.398
Flamethrower.

12:01.035 --> 12:03.235
We still carry that shit.
People drink it.

12:03.237 --> 12:04.939
- No.
- Yeah, man.

12:06.174 --> 12:07.242
How's business?

12:08.444 --> 12:11.179
Fucking terrible.
Have you been to the west side yet?

12:13.113 --> 12:15.550
- There ain't a west side.
- Dude, you've been living under a rock?

12:17.049 --> 12:20.189
The town's gentrifying.
Manscaped beards and feathered fedoras.

12:20.421 --> 12:22.457
There's even some
swanky art gallery.

12:22.924 --> 12:26.395
What business used to trickle
its way here is all dried up.

12:27.194 --> 12:30.031
Your brother's the only person
keeping this place in business.

12:31.065 --> 12:32.164
Yeah.

12:32.166 --> 12:33.569
Shit. Hang on.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.588
Holy shit, Earl.

12:53.021 --> 12:54.519
What the hell is all this?

12:54.521 --> 12:56.889
Hang on,
time is of the essence.

12:56.891 --> 12:58.393
I'm getting in on this ICO.

12:58.993 --> 13:00.393
Is that Bitcoin?

13:00.395 --> 13:02.995
No, man. It's for this new token
called Delta Coin.

13:02.997 --> 13:04.529
It's a new app they're building
on the US blockchain.

13:04.531 --> 13:06.666
The white paper's the shit,
really cutting-edge.

13:06.668 --> 13:07.602
You want to get in on it?

13:08.370 --> 13:09.538
No, I'm good.

13:10.604 --> 13:12.437
Your electric bill's got
to be insane.

13:12.439 --> 13:15.977
No, man, it's all good.
Only 10% of whatever I'm mining.

13:16.176 --> 13:19.144
Plus the crypto day-trading,
I average like 500 a day.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.346
You heard about the TRAC coin?

13:21.348 --> 13:24.619
To be honest, I only understand about
5% of what you're talking about.

13:25.252 --> 13:26.421
Seriously?

13:27.723 --> 13:30.226
Dang, man. You better brush up.
This shit is the future of money.

13:32.493 --> 13:34.396
So you're back to help out
your dad and bro?

13:35.030 --> 13:37.299
- Looks like they could use it.
- No, I...

13:38.132 --> 13:41.634
I'm just dealing with some compliance
issues at the Omni branch here.

13:41.636 --> 13:43.171
Just being modest.

13:43.570 --> 13:45.506
What do I owe you
for the beer?

13:46.540 --> 13:49.174
Get the fuck out of here.
Your money's no good to me.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.311
Oh, come on.

13:51.578 --> 13:54.149
Old times, dude.
Just steal it.

13:59.087 --> 14:01.086
Hey, don't be a stranger.

14:01.088 --> 14:02.324
Wouldn't think of it.

14:25.213 --> 14:26.412
Hey!

14:51.106 --> 14:52.374
That's him.

14:53.675 --> 14:56.142
- Hey, you must be Marty.
- Yes.

14:56.144 --> 14:58.647
You are right on time, just as Ms.
Whiting said you would be.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.279
Would you like a slice of cake?

15:01.281 --> 15:02.417
No, thank you.

15:03.318 --> 15:05.083
Oh. Of course.

15:05.085 --> 15:07.255
Uh, let me introduce
you to everyone.

15:07.521 --> 15:09.489
- Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen...
- Actually...

15:09.491 --> 15:13.493
I prefer to keep my presence here
discrete during my initial audit.

15:13.495 --> 15:18.167
These types of things, they work a little
better if there's some... separation.

15:20.401 --> 15:21.734
Okay.

15:21.736 --> 15:23.304
We like to think
of ourselves as a family.

15:24.139 --> 15:26.642
And... here we are.

15:27.708 --> 15:31.576
You got your coffee station
over here, nice little setup.

15:31.578 --> 15:34.650
Files are all organized.
You can find what you need over here.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.218
Got your computer, your desk.

15:38.218 --> 15:39.121
Chair.

15:39.788 --> 15:41.223
Make yourself at home.

15:41.488 --> 15:43.056
Um...

15:43.058 --> 15:45.158
Eric is supposed to take care
of this,

15:45.160 --> 15:48.594
but I don't know when he's
gonna get around to it, so...

15:48.596 --> 15:50.299
Let me know
if you need anything.

15:50.497 --> 15:52.300
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

15:54.501 --> 15:55.471
Chair.

15:58.705 --> 16:00.141
I got a few more for you.

16:00.474 --> 16:01.642
You can just put them...

16:03.477 --> 16:05.144
Just put them wherever.

16:05.146 --> 16:06.745
You got all your existing
LEC files in there,

16:06.747 --> 16:09.617
transaction reports
and any SAR paperwork.

16:09.851 --> 16:12.721
And then all your due diligence
reports with the new LEC are up there.

16:14.088 --> 16:17.025
Yeah, that Janice.
She definitely fell a little behind.

16:17.224 --> 16:19.258
I'm sorry to hear she's sick.

16:19.260 --> 16:21.396
Is there any chance I could
speak with her before she leaves?

16:21.596 --> 16:24.596
No, she's already gone,
but I can get you her number.

16:24.598 --> 16:25.599
Thanks.

16:26.534 --> 16:29.104
I'd like to preserve
any continuity if possible,

16:29.838 --> 16:31.640
given the circumstances.

16:32.740 --> 16:35.044
You don't recognize me,
do you?

16:37.344 --> 16:38.546
I'm sorry.

16:38.746 --> 16:40.616
We went to high school
together.

16:41.815 --> 16:44.452
- Auto shop.
- Man, it's...

16:45.120 --> 16:47.423
- It's been such a long time...
- It's fine.

16:48.323 --> 16:49.525
Drew.

16:50.458 --> 16:51.559
Smith.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.226
Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:54.228 --> 16:55.296
Of course.

16:56.330 --> 16:59.264
- I'm sorry, man. I'm an idiot.
- Don't worry, man.

16:59.266 --> 17:02.703
This whole town's forgettable,
so just kill me.

17:04.606 --> 17:07.276
If you need anything else,
let me know.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.588
- Hey, what's your name?
- I'm Bill.

17:53.187 --> 17:54.519
Have you seen Drew?

17:54.521 --> 17:56.290
I think he's at lunch.

17:57.825 --> 17:59.692
I'm trying to figure out why Endelman
Gallery didn't file CTR exemptions.

17:59.694 --> 18:01.129
- Don't know.
- Marty.

18:06.867 --> 18:08.302
So it's true.

18:10.972 --> 18:12.574
Hi, Caleb.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.344
That's it, huh?

18:17.511 --> 18:19.481
We haven't seen each other
since Mom died.

18:20.581 --> 18:22.216
Ten years.

18:22.716 --> 18:23.784
"Hi, Caleb"?

18:26.887 --> 18:28.322
Well, you look good.

18:28.889 --> 18:30.291
Doing real well.

18:31.225 --> 18:32.727
Yeah, well, it's been a while.

18:35.829 --> 18:37.198
Cool mug.

18:43.338 --> 18:44.836
How's Dad?

18:44.838 --> 18:46.474
What do you fucking care?

18:56.483 --> 18:57.685
Later.

18:58.586 --> 18:59.755
Hello?

19:03.023 --> 19:04.760
No. Yeah, I found him.

19:15.936 --> 19:19.038
Can you find me the CIP file
for Endelman Gallery?

19:19.040 --> 19:22.907
I need their physical address,
and also I need Janice's number.

19:22.909 --> 19:24.312
Sure.

19:50.538 --> 19:51.673
Hello?

20:17.865 --> 20:19.367
Can I help you?

20:19.867 --> 20:21.002
Hi.

20:21.536 --> 20:24.373
- Did I...
- Yes, you did.

20:24.672 --> 20:26.775
- The other day.
- Okay.

20:27.107 --> 20:29.107
- Wow.
- Wow?

20:29.109 --> 20:30.411
No, sorry.

20:30.978 --> 20:32.681
No, I just mean it's...

20:32.980 --> 20:35.450
You were at the liquor store,
and now you're here.

20:35.716 --> 20:38.853
Well, art dealers moonlight
as normal people, too, you know?

20:39.419 --> 20:41.355
We have livers,
just like everyone else.

20:41.989 --> 20:44.559
I'm going to start over.
I'm Martin.

20:45.059 --> 20:47.058
I distinctly heard your friend
call you Marty,

20:47.060 --> 20:48.763
so I think I'm going
to call you Marty.

20:49.097 --> 20:51.465
- I'm Katie.
- Katie, hi.

20:51.933 --> 20:54.499
- What brings you in today?
- Actually, I...

20:54.501 --> 20:56.102
I need to talk to the owner.

20:56.104 --> 20:57.905
Just some routine bank stuff.

20:58.138 --> 21:01.842
I'm an AML officer.
It's anti-money laundering.

21:02.876 --> 21:05.813
That sounds very official.
Which hand do I salute with?

21:06.513 --> 21:08.015
Well, you need Penelope.

21:08.915 --> 21:11.116
Yes. Yeah.

21:11.118 --> 21:13.818
She's not the actual owner,
which you wouldn't know by talking to her.

21:13.820 --> 21:16.324
But she's kind of like
a franchisee.

21:16.624 --> 21:18.923
- Cool.
- Okay, Marty. What's your last name?

21:18.925 --> 21:20.662
Duran. Martin Duran.

21:21.128 --> 21:22.795
All right. I'll go get her.

21:22.797 --> 21:25.733
Sit tight. And... buckle up.

21:27.001 --> 21:28.403
Okay.

21:38.011 --> 21:43.018
You... are far too gorgeous
to be a banker.

21:43.518 --> 21:45.520
Look at that bone structure.

21:45.886 --> 21:47.987
Hi, I'm... I'm Martin.

21:47.989 --> 21:50.792
Yes, yes, of course you are.
Blah, blah, blah.

21:51.959 --> 21:53.495
What is this?

21:55.797 --> 21:56.798
Macy's?

21:58.465 --> 21:59.934
Oh, God, here it comes.

22:01.336 --> 22:03.972
A beautiful boy from New York City
has arrived to see me and I...

22:04.438 --> 22:05.940
I think to myself,
"Oh, thank God."

22:06.441 --> 22:07.705
But then...

22:07.707 --> 22:09.944
this, a piece
of country candy.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.845
The kind you have to suck on
for a little bit,

22:12.847 --> 22:15.684
where it gets stuck between your teeth.
Do you know what I mean?

22:17.652 --> 22:18.953
No, I...

22:20.155 --> 22:22.991
I'm sorry, I just need to ask
you about your financials.

22:23.723 --> 22:27.928
I noticed the bank might have
filed inappropriate CTR exemptions.

22:28.963 --> 22:30.632
If I could just verify
your books.

22:31.598 --> 22:34.034
Do I look like the kind
of person who keeps books?

22:36.203 --> 22:37.973
We have an accountant.

22:38.673 --> 22:40.138
You'll need to speak to him.

22:40.140 --> 22:43.010
That's fine.
I just need his information.

22:44.244 --> 22:46.814
Kat, get him
David's information.

22:47.581 --> 22:49.582
- You mean Ted?
- Yes, yes.

22:49.584 --> 22:51.787
Whatever the fuck his name is.

22:59.092 --> 23:00.461
I'll be right back.

23:01.596 --> 23:04.195
- You have some beautiful art in here.
- Yes, I do.

23:04.197 --> 23:05.964
Do you appreciate art?

23:05.966 --> 23:07.134
I try to.

23:07.768 --> 23:08.804
Try...

23:09.270 --> 23:12.007
One doesn't try
to appreciate art.

23:13.007 --> 23:16.945
An alpinist doesn't try to summit.
That's all there is.

23:17.712 --> 23:22.017
The climax is in realization.
You either reach the climax,

23:22.782 --> 23:23.851
or you don't.

23:24.519 --> 23:25.886
Wouldn't you say?

23:27.187 --> 23:28.823
I guess so.

23:34.529 --> 23:36.030
I don't buy it.

23:37.231 --> 23:39.901
All this trying and...

23:40.233 --> 23:42.670
guessing that you talk about.

23:45.973 --> 23:48.909
Kat, see Mr. Duran out.

23:49.242 --> 23:51.143
- Wow.
- I warned you.

23:51.145 --> 23:54.049
Well, nobody could be prepared
for whatever that was.

23:54.948 --> 23:57.618
This guy gives me the creeps,
by the way.

23:58.752 --> 23:59.954
Thank you.

24:02.623 --> 24:04.222
Ted! Oh, yeah.

24:21.742 --> 24:22.944
Has he called you yet?

24:24.177 --> 24:26.080
Huh? Who?

24:26.813 --> 24:27.948
The banker.

24:32.052 --> 24:34.688
I have no fucking idea what
you're talking about right now.

24:35.889 --> 24:38.225
The banker who came
to see me today at the gallery.

24:40.595 --> 24:41.963
Or was that yesterday?

24:42.996 --> 24:45.099
Either way,
he was asking questions.

24:48.101 --> 24:49.703
What kind of questions?

24:53.974 --> 24:55.010
Hey.

24:56.210 --> 24:57.879
Baby, what kind of questions?

24:59.780 --> 25:01.016
I don't know.

25:02.349 --> 25:03.651
You know me.

25:05.118 --> 25:06.954
When it comes to numbers
I just...

25:07.922 --> 25:09.124
fall apart.

25:10.257 --> 25:11.660
Sure.

25:14.127 --> 25:17.131
Come on, I got to go back to work.
Don't... I don't fucking...

25:20.734 --> 25:22.236
Jesus Christ.

25:36.149 --> 25:40.321
I just don't want 'em
finding out, you know?

25:43.790 --> 25:45.292
Don't worry, they won't.

25:48.396 --> 25:50.165
I'm not a bad person.

25:53.033 --> 25:54.969
I'm just bad with money.

25:58.772 --> 25:59.974
Hey.

26:00.441 --> 26:01.876
Hey, Pen.

26:03.109 --> 26:06.280
Hey. Hey, I got to go back
to work.

26:07.915 --> 26:10.985
Oh, Jesus.
What a fucking waste.

26:42.215 --> 26:44.450
<i>Da.</i>

26:44.452 --> 26:47.422
<i>♪ The look in your eyes ♪</i>

26:47.821 --> 26:51.390
<i>♪ When you know
She's waiting for you ♪</i>

26:51.392 --> 26:53.192
- Off-key?
- Yeah, just a little bit.

26:53.194 --> 26:55.230
I think that's an
understatement of the century.

26:55.762 --> 26:57.031
What can I get you?

26:58.132 --> 27:00.332
- A Bud Light.
- I need to see ID.

27:00.334 --> 27:01.803
Bud Light.

27:02.936 --> 27:04.838
Wow, must be a funeral
around here.

27:05.806 --> 27:07.375
You on a diet, city boy?

27:08.876 --> 27:10.744
Hey, Allie. Give him a Perrier and
a little umbrella with it, will you?

27:12.812 --> 27:14.214
Now you want to buy my drink?

27:14.749 --> 27:16.084
I don't want to buy your drink.

27:16.383 --> 27:17.819
You're not my type.

27:18.351 --> 27:20.155
Well, then mind
your goddamn business.

27:22.388 --> 27:24.158
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

27:26.193 --> 27:27.893
You're going
to cold-stare me, too, huh?

27:27.895 --> 27:29.862
Right, tough guy?

27:29.864 --> 27:32.263
You're not related to Caleb
Duran down on the 40, are you?

27:32.265 --> 27:34.368
- That's my brother.
- Oh, shit.

27:35.368 --> 27:37.738
- Yeah.
- Caleb's your brother, huh?

27:39.106 --> 27:40.308
Yeah.

27:42.443 --> 27:43.712
Wow.

27:44.678 --> 27:46.278
Hey, Allie. Let me buy
this guy his drink.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.750
- No, you don't have to do that.
- No, my mistake.

27:50.283 --> 27:52.152
Your brother coming
in early tonight?

27:52.986 --> 27:54.488
I have no fucking idea.

28:20.013 --> 28:21.315
Jesus, Earl.

28:40.967 --> 28:42.369
That son of a bitch.

28:53.313 --> 28:54.348
Password?

28:55.182 --> 28:56.851
Fuck.

28:57.184 --> 28:58.520
Hey, Marty.

28:59.887 --> 29:01.388
It's French fry day, and we do a
group order from Marcy's Diner.

29:02.223 --> 29:04.189
No, I don't really
like French fries.

29:04.191 --> 29:05.894
There's a burger in here, too.

29:07.194 --> 29:09.263
Dang, man,
you're really buried, huh?

29:09.963 --> 29:11.232
Yeah, I am.

29:12.599 --> 29:14.399
Hey, Janice didn't answer
any of the phone calls.

29:14.401 --> 29:15.436
Do you have an address?

29:15.903 --> 29:17.872
I'm sure I can find it.

29:18.405 --> 29:19.840
Great.

29:20.573 --> 29:21.975
- And...
- Yeah.

29:22.342 --> 29:24.311
Thanks. Thanks for lunch.

29:24.944 --> 29:25.946
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

30:15.361 --> 30:16.997
I found her address.

30:17.196 --> 30:20.100
- Are they foreclosing on my dad?
- Shit, you scared me, dude.

30:20.334 --> 30:21.936
Did you know about this?

30:22.168 --> 30:25.105
I... Of course.
Everyone does.

30:26.173 --> 30:29.077
I heard they offered him a decent
chunk of change. He turned it down.

32:09.443 --> 32:10.645
You here to help?

32:12.745 --> 32:14.181
If I can.

32:17.117 --> 32:18.519
What happened to the crops?

32:18.819 --> 32:20.722
Cold snap. Late.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.023
Most of it died, so...

32:24.791 --> 32:26.327
You here to help?

32:26.559 --> 32:28.695
If you're asking me if I'm
going to help you harvest, no.

32:30.364 --> 32:32.500
- I can help with the money side of things.
- Don't...

32:33.800 --> 32:35.336
want your money.

32:36.470 --> 32:37.739
I wasn't offering.

32:39.572 --> 32:41.074
But I can give you advice.

32:41.375 --> 32:42.577
I got work to do.

32:44.110 --> 32:45.579
There are things you can do.

32:46.346 --> 32:47.647
Bring in a silent partner.

32:48.448 --> 32:50.749
We can work on restructuring
the loans you have.

32:50.751 --> 32:53.588
- Or maybe subdivide and sell off...
- Grab a shovel, Marty.

32:54.253 --> 32:55.389
Or go.

33:35.462 --> 33:37.261
<i>I'm telling you, man.</i>

33:37.263 --> 33:40.164
Banks, hedge funds,
they're buying up crypto.

33:40.166 --> 33:43.401
Maybe for investment purposes,
but I think they're trying to sabotage it.

33:43.403 --> 33:44.502
Why would they do that?

33:44.504 --> 33:46.337
They can't control it.

33:46.339 --> 33:48.373
No centralized regulation.
It cuts them out of the action.

33:48.375 --> 33:50.241
But I thought it was
all dark-web shit.

33:50.243 --> 33:52.611
Terrorists, human trafficking,
drug dealers...

33:52.613 --> 33:54.712
It is to some degree,

33:54.714 --> 33:57.452
but the banks use all that shit to inject
a moral element that doesn't exist.

33:57.684 --> 34:00.585
Trust me. The central banks are
going to try and destroy it.

34:00.587 --> 34:02.520
- Just watch.
- How?

34:02.522 --> 34:05.390
Invest in it, turn the other way,
drive the price through the roof

34:05.392 --> 34:07.526
and scare the people
it originally appealed to away.

34:07.528 --> 34:11.364
Now, you really believe all this shit?
Or are you just bored out of your mind?

34:11.597 --> 34:13.632
Are those two things
mutually exclusive?

34:14.234 --> 34:16.804
Look, you got to have something
to believe in, Marty.

34:17.335 --> 34:18.672
This is a revolution.

34:19.272 --> 34:21.272
<i>Viva la revolución!</i>

34:21.274 --> 34:23.308
Take it easy, man.

34:23.310 --> 34:24.779
Don't gaslight me.

34:25.745 --> 34:27.714
These guys know what
I'm talking about, right?

34:27.914 --> 34:29.850
It's all chaos, so we drink.

34:30.684 --> 34:32.620
And I'm lucky 'cause
I own a liquor store.

34:33.319 --> 34:34.784
So what am I doing here?

34:34.786 --> 34:37.221
I don't mean that existentially,
I mean that literally.

34:37.223 --> 34:39.790
I could be drinking for free,
or at least wholesale.

34:39.792 --> 34:42.161
I'm sorry. Sorry, everybody.

34:44.197 --> 34:47.734
I looked in to see if Omni
had any cryptocurrencies.

34:48.502 --> 34:51.205
But I don't have access
to those accounts.

34:51.571 --> 34:54.705
Shit. That's not an issue. If it's a
password you need, I can find one of those.

34:54.706 --> 34:57.511
- That's not happening.
- Why not? You looked at my shit.

35:00.347 --> 35:01.779
- No, I...
- I know you did.

35:01.781 --> 35:04.251
And don't say it's your job.
You had no good reason.

35:04.751 --> 35:07.419
You probably looked at your dad
and your brother's shit, too.

35:07.421 --> 35:10.388
I know because I would have.
I'm just honest enough to admit it.

35:10.390 --> 35:11.756
Well, there's a big difference.

35:11.758 --> 35:13.928
Yeah, you had a business card
that says "Omni."

35:14.894 --> 35:18.398
Hey, everyone.
Welcome to karaoke night at the Gin Mill.

35:18.731 --> 35:20.932
Is every night karaoke night?

35:20.934 --> 35:23.437
Sometimes it ain't so bad.

35:24.738 --> 35:27.675
This was one
of my mother's favorites.

35:27.975 --> 35:29.741
Well,
this girl is everywhere.

35:29.743 --> 35:31.743

35:31.745 --> 35:33.614

35:37.917 --> 35:44.457

36:19.026 --> 36:21.959
Drink someplace else.
There's a fag bar over on the west side.

36:21.961 --> 36:23.895
Whoa, dude.
No need to say shit like that.

36:23.897 --> 36:25.796
Shut your mouth, Earl.

36:25.798 --> 36:28.533
No, this place obviously means
more to you than it does to me.

36:28.535 --> 36:30.334
Why don't you get
the fuck out of here?

36:30.336 --> 36:32.872
- Hey, take it outside!
- Come on, Marty.

36:40.946 --> 36:42.415
That was fun.

36:43.649 --> 36:45.418
- Good, bro?
- I'm good.

36:45.852 --> 36:47.288
Text me, all right?

36:47.653 --> 36:48.822
Yeah, see you later.

36:58.564 --> 37:01.832
You don't get to walk back in
here like nothing ever happened.

37:01.834 --> 37:03.838
Yo! Chill out, chill out.
Come on.

37:04.604 --> 37:06.374
Chill the fuck out.

37:07.374 --> 37:09.040
- Calm down, come on.
- Stop!

37:09.042 --> 37:11.279
Hey, stop! That's enough.

37:11.812 --> 37:12.713
Stop.

37:33.466 --> 37:36.336
I worked there for
a few years after college and...

37:37.069 --> 37:40.774
I had this dream.
I wanted to own a gallery in the city.

37:41.408 --> 37:43.344
But I overshot a little,
I guess.

37:44.944 --> 37:46.613
How long have you been here?

37:48.082 --> 37:52.620
A couple of years. And I've worked
at the gallery like six months or so.

37:53.519 --> 37:55.655
It feels like
a fucking eternity.

37:58.624 --> 38:00.927
What's up with you
and your brother?

38:02.828 --> 38:04.497
I don't know.

38:05.131 --> 38:07.001
He's not a bad guy.

38:08.602 --> 38:11.839
In another life he could
have been a gentleman.

38:13.006 --> 38:16.410
There's two words that don't belong
together when I think of my brother.

38:16.843 --> 38:18.713
Anything else
for the two of you?

38:20.546 --> 38:22.749
We're okay, Marcy. Thanks.

38:27.787 --> 38:31.189
You know, Marcy refinanced her
house to keep this place going.

38:31.191 --> 38:32.893
She's so deep in the hole...

38:33.459 --> 38:34.861
she'll never make it out.

38:35.961 --> 38:37.397
Seriously?

38:38.664 --> 38:39.800
Yeah.

38:42.435 --> 38:46.406
You must know all kinds of things,
back there behind the curtain.

38:47.140 --> 38:49.542
Yeah, but it's all depressing.

38:50.577 --> 38:52.513
I never wanted
to come back here.

38:53.946 --> 38:56.450
You know, everyone is
so fucking predictable.

38:58.818 --> 39:00.553
And full of surprises.

39:12.031 --> 39:13.834
Thanks for seeing me, Janice.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.972
I was going through Endelman
Gallery's customer ID file.

39:19.071 --> 39:22.675
I'm not entirely satisfied with
the way due diligence was handled.

39:23.243 --> 39:26.547
Did you run them
against OFAC or FinCEN?

39:28.948 --> 39:30.117
Okay.

39:31.383 --> 39:34.218
Were you responsible for filing
the suspicious activity reports?

39:34.220 --> 39:36.087
Look, don't be naive.

39:36.089 --> 39:38.089
Most of the business
in a town like this

39:38.091 --> 39:40.991
is underwritten by handshakes
and mutual respect.

39:40.993 --> 39:42.727
No, I understand that.

39:42.729 --> 39:45.098
I'm just trying to establish
some continuity here.

39:45.832 --> 39:47.902
Well, I think that's going
to be hard for you to do.

39:48.502 --> 39:49.901
Excuse me?

39:49.903 --> 39:53.774
I'm afraid I left things
in quite a mess.

39:55.008 --> 39:59.944
I just got so sick
and I waited too long to retire.

39:59.946 --> 40:03.717
Afraid I'd lose my job
and my health insurance.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.888
I should get out
of your hair now.

40:12.124 --> 40:14.027
I'm sorry, I...

40:14.227 --> 40:15.529
That's okay.

40:16.062 --> 40:18.095
Is that all you need?

40:18.097 --> 40:20.066
I just need to know if there's anything
you can tell me about Endelman.

40:20.734 --> 40:22.102
Endelman...

40:22.968 --> 40:24.070
Um...

40:25.238 --> 40:27.004
Carcass... No.

40:27.006 --> 40:28.508
Carcasse.

40:29.008 --> 40:30.975
- Carcasse?
- Mm-hmm.

40:30.977 --> 40:35.712
I asked the accountant who owned
the business and he said "Carcasse."

40:35.714 --> 40:38.049
But then I asked him
to clarify,

40:38.051 --> 40:40.521
and he corrected himself
and said, "Never mind."

40:40.854 --> 40:43.557
I don't even know why
I remember that. I'm sorry.

40:45.057 --> 40:47.694
- Well, thank you so much for your help.
- Thank you.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.660
Yeah.

40:49.662 --> 40:52.098
Can I confess something
to you?

40:53.966 --> 40:55.602
Sure.

40:57.071 --> 40:59.673
Meeting you has given me great faith
that you'll sort everything out.

41:04.077 --> 41:04.979
Yeah.

41:31.037 --> 41:32.740
Did you forget something?

41:37.877 --> 41:38.545
Who are you?

41:39.111 --> 41:41.180
- Didn't Marcos call you?
- No.

41:42.147 --> 41:44.919
Yeah, his son injured his ankle
playing soccer today.

41:45.352 --> 41:48.122
He's been dealing with that all
day, and he asked me to fill in.

41:50.723 --> 41:52.660
Okay, come on in.

41:54.660 --> 41:56.294
I really don't like surprises.

41:56.296 --> 41:58.895
Don't worry,
Marcos gave me your protocol.

41:58.897 --> 42:00.133
We'll fix you right up.

42:08.675 --> 42:10.611
So Marcos has a son, huh?

42:11.410 --> 42:13.146
I didn't even know that.

42:14.981 --> 42:16.316
The things you don't know.

42:18.885 --> 42:21.386
This may pinch just a bit.

42:21.388 --> 42:22.823
I know.

42:24.823 --> 42:25.892
Ow!

42:26.158 --> 42:27.327
You okay?

42:28.060 --> 42:29.095
Yeah.

42:29.995 --> 42:31.365
Yeah, I'm fine.

42:32.832 --> 42:34.799
All set.

42:34.801 --> 42:36.036
Okay.

42:52.151 --> 42:56.055
<i>Aye. And I wager it's
on account of them two strangers.</i>

42:57.823 --> 42:58.858
No...

42:59.191 --> 43:00.660
That burns.

43:01.026 --> 43:02.929
- What are you...
- No, just give it a second.

43:03.396 --> 43:04.765
That can happen sometimes.

43:08.368 --> 43:10.067
There we go.

43:10.069 --> 43:11.838
<i>To all my friends in Nevada...</i>

43:14.740 --> 43:16.175
<i>...my deepest appreciation</i>

43:17.109 --> 43:20.111
<i>for the way you've honored me.</i>

43:20.113 --> 43:21.214
It's okay.

43:24.818 --> 43:26.319
<i>But for personal reasons,</i>

43:26.986 --> 43:29.656
<i>I hereby withdraw my name</i>

43:32.124 --> 43:33.893
<i>for consideration</i>

43:35.227 --> 43:37.097
<i>as a possible candidate</i>

43:38.765 --> 43:42.069
<i>for governor of the state
of Nevada.</i>

43:44.104 --> 43:46.774
Mr. Patterson,
this is Martin Duran again.

43:47.372 --> 43:49.443
I'd really appreciate
if you'd call me back.

43:49.876 --> 43:52.245
I just have a few questions
about the Endelman Gallery.

43:52.444 --> 43:54.881
It shouldn't take any time.
Thanks.

44:17.870 --> 44:18.805
Carcasse.

44:23.977 --> 44:25.179
So much for that.

44:35.053 --> 44:36.423
What the hell is this?

45:04.984 --> 45:07.317
<i>Martin, hey. Just checking in.</i>

45:07.319 --> 45:10.124
- <i>How are things going?</i>
- I'm all right. It's...

45:11.089 --> 45:13.359
It's a little bit
of a mess, but...

45:13.892 --> 45:16.095
<i>Wow. Well, you are
the right man for the job.</i>

45:17.263 --> 45:21.499
<i>Hey, look, the reason I'm calling
is we've got a bit of a situation.</i>

45:21.501 --> 45:24.134
What does that mean?

45:24.136 --> 45:26.904
<i>Apparently Omni's been experiencing
an unusual amount of cyber intrusion.</i>

45:26.906 --> 45:28.339
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

45:28.341 --> 45:30.473
<i>And the bank is running
an internal audit</i>

45:30.475 --> 45:33.180
<i>and they just released a list of
personnel they'd like to question.</i>

45:33.546 --> 45:35.345
<i>And you and I are on it.</i>

45:35.347 --> 45:37.982
Sorry, but why the hell
are we on the list?

45:37.984 --> 45:40.250
<i>It doesn't mean we're suspects.
It might just as soon mean</i>

45:40.252 --> 45:43.154
<i>that we're people they can rely
upon for an honest testimonial.</i>

45:43.156 --> 45:46.360
<i>So they've set up a time for you
to do an interview next week.</i>

45:47.593 --> 45:49.128
<i>Hey, look. I got to jump.</i>

45:49.495 --> 45:51.127
<i>I just wanted to give you
a heads-up.</i>

45:51.129 --> 45:53.163
<i>And please don't mention
this to anybody.</i>

45:53.165 --> 45:55.035
<i>You and I have nothing to hide.</i>

45:56.002 --> 45:57.905
- <i>I'll talk to you soon.</i>
- Okay.

46:02.575 --> 46:04.011
Shit.

46:12.084 --> 46:13.386
<i>What's wrong?</i>

46:13.919 --> 46:15.321
<i>You look worried.</i>

46:16.756 --> 46:20.057
Somehow the bank thinks I'm involved
with some hacking thing, which is...

46:20.059 --> 46:23.030
insane because I don't know
the first thing about the stuff.

46:24.564 --> 46:25.999
Is that all?

46:26.399 --> 46:28.101
It's kind of a big deal.

46:30.002 --> 46:35.105
Well, not necessarily.
It could be a routine or random.

46:35.107 --> 46:37.241
I mean, if you were running
an investigation,

46:37.243 --> 46:40.047
would you want your subjects to
know you were investigating them?

46:40.245 --> 46:41.414
That's a good point.

46:42.147 --> 46:43.416
What's really bothering you?

46:45.017 --> 46:47.417
I met with the lady
I replaced at the bank.

46:47.419 --> 46:49.088
- Janice.
- Oh, yeah?

46:49.488 --> 46:52.525
I feel really bad for her.
She's a sweetheart.

46:53.225 --> 46:55.261
I mean, she just made
a ton of mistakes.

46:56.662 --> 46:59.398
And there was one thing she said
that stuck with me, though.

47:00.232 --> 47:02.033
Well, about Endelman Gallery,
actually.

47:02.035 --> 47:03.433
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:03.435 --> 47:05.569
What?

47:05.571 --> 47:10.444
She said that when Ted Patterson came in
to do the initial compliance paperwork

47:11.176 --> 47:13.711
there was some confusion about
who the owner was.

47:13.713 --> 47:17.551
Then he said he was mistaken
and listed Penelope, rushing.

47:18.718 --> 47:22.122
I mean, you said yourself Penelope's
not technically the owner.

47:23.055 --> 47:25.455
I'll be honest.
I said that because I hate my boss

47:25.457 --> 47:27.360
and my only power's
insubordination.

47:28.593 --> 47:30.463
So she does own the gallery?

47:31.397 --> 47:33.296
Dude, what the fuck?

47:33.298 --> 47:34.467
- Hi.
- Sorry.

47:34.667 --> 47:36.002
Did you get my text?

47:36.301 --> 47:37.604
Is this about Bitcoin again?

47:38.136 --> 47:39.504
Yeah, a new ICO.

47:40.305 --> 47:44.243
Hey, man. Sorry, I feel like I'm
always yelling when you're around.

47:45.544 --> 47:47.444
I'm going to get back
to the gallery.

47:47.446 --> 47:48.515
I'll text you later.

47:51.417 --> 47:53.921
Dude, you got to see this.
Now.

47:55.988 --> 47:58.723
- I can't be doing this.
- No, you can't not be doing this.

47:58.725 --> 48:02.258
If you care about what you do as a whistle-blower,
you can't afford not to see this.

48:02.260 --> 48:03.660
There's too much gray area.

48:03.662 --> 48:05.196
Isn't that your job?

48:05.198 --> 48:07.464
Why do you suddenly care
so much about this?

48:07.466 --> 48:10.066
When I see things like this,
I get pretty worried.

48:10.068 --> 48:13.139
Fine, man. Just show me.
Let's get this over with.

48:16.542 --> 48:19.542
See what I did there with the
clues I sent you? Pretty clever, huh?

48:19.544 --> 48:21.544
Super clever.

48:21.546 --> 48:23.513
I love those clues.
<i>Blue's Clues,</i> Jacques Clue-steau,

48:23.515 --> 48:25.618
- <i>Clues Encounters of the Third Kind.</i>
- I get it.

48:27.586 --> 48:31.190
There. This is Omni's last quarter's
investment in cryptocurrencies.

48:31.691 --> 48:35.026
- Holy shit.
- Holy shit is right.

48:35.028 --> 48:37.230
Ten mil isn't
a casual investment.

48:37.530 --> 48:39.732
They used something called Merkel
Trading as an intermediary.

48:40.533 --> 48:44.234
No phone number, no email.
Just query fields.

48:44.236 --> 48:45.671
Click the "about" page.

48:47.472 --> 48:49.740
They're an OTC front.

48:49.742 --> 48:52.776
My guess is they're buying Bitcoin
over-the-counter to avoid market slippage.

48:52.778 --> 48:54.712
What's that?

48:54.714 --> 48:55.716
They don't want to rock the
boat they're climbing into.

49:03.656 --> 49:05.225
What else?

49:05.557 --> 49:07.725
Well, I'm not exactly sure.

49:07.727 --> 49:10.330
Merkel was a brick wall, so naturally
I figured out a way to scale it.

49:12.631 --> 49:15.068
Transactions, shitloads of them.

49:15.401 --> 49:16.834
This is Omni.

49:16.836 --> 49:18.769
And these are the entities
they're buying from.

49:18.771 --> 49:21.337
They bought a lot of Bitcoin
from a lot of different people.

49:21.339 --> 49:23.174
- Okay.
- Now these folks are smart.

49:23.176 --> 49:24.841
They're using Tor networks
to keep their shit hush-hush,

49:24.843 --> 49:25.878
so I used a bad apple attack.

49:26.812 --> 49:29.412
Earl, you're very smart,
but why does this matter?

49:29.414 --> 49:31.381
Only a tinfoil hat.

49:31.383 --> 49:35.388
None of it mattered until I saw it
was all coming from one IP address.

49:35.787 --> 49:37.757
And that IP is located...

49:39.825 --> 49:41.327
- Canada?
- Yep.

49:41.526 --> 49:43.828
Carcasse Bait and Tackle,
to be precise.

49:43.830 --> 49:45.699
What did you say?

49:46.164 --> 49:47.798
Bait and Tackle? Yeah, I
know, the possibilities are endless.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.767
Something fishy going on,
classic bait-and-switch...

49:49.769 --> 49:51.604
No, no. The...

49:52.205 --> 49:54.471
- The first word.
- Carcasse?

50:01.613 --> 50:02.846
This is insane.

50:02.848 --> 50:04.350
What?

50:08.354 --> 50:10.187
You've got to figure out
what's going on in this place.

50:10.189 --> 50:11.754
Well, I'm not going up there.

50:11.756 --> 50:13.756
There's a healthy possibility
they're just a mirror,

50:13.758 --> 50:15.292
and I don't want to kick
a hornet's nest.

50:15.294 --> 50:17.397
Be right there.

50:21.600 --> 50:23.069
Jesus, guy.

50:35.448 --> 50:36.316
Hello.

50:36.848 --> 50:39.285
Hey, man, you following me
or something?

50:39.484 --> 50:40.385
Yes.

50:43.555 --> 50:45.758
No, I remembered you owned
a liquor store.

50:46.425 --> 50:49.763
And then I saw you at the diner
and I thought, "This is your fate."

50:50.263 --> 50:54.334
Right, shit.
Sorry, I was pretty wasted that night.

50:55.167 --> 50:56.336
So, what's up, man?

50:56.568 --> 50:58.871
I was wondering
if you have... vodka.

50:59.504 --> 51:01.273
Yeah, sure, man.
Over in aisle two.

51:01.707 --> 51:04.611
No. Not this factory piss.

51:05.310 --> 51:07.113
Real vodka.

51:09.247 --> 51:10.349
I'll write a name down
for you.

51:10.649 --> 51:11.684
You'll like it.

51:14.386 --> 51:15.622
You have paper?

51:24.263 --> 51:26.529
This can be hard to find,
but...

51:26.531 --> 51:29.435
I don't think it will be hard
to find... for you.

51:30.368 --> 51:31.571
What do you mean?

51:32.338 --> 51:33.205
Nothing.

51:34.240 --> 51:35.841
How will I let you know
if I get it in?

51:36.676 --> 51:37.711
You don't have to.

51:38.410 --> 51:39.778
I'm following you,
remember?

51:40.713 --> 51:41.915
I'll see you around.

51:59.631 --> 52:02.635
So you think you can figure out what's
going on in this Carcasse place?

52:03.935 --> 52:04.838
Yeah, I think so.

52:06.238 --> 52:07.870
Well, I have another big favor
to ask.

52:07.872 --> 52:10.374
My favor bank is
running pretty low, my friend.

52:10.376 --> 52:13.280
No, I know. I know.
And I'll make it up to you.

52:14.280 --> 52:15.348
Yeah, what is it?

52:15.747 --> 52:17.684
Tell me this isn't us
poking around.

52:21.754 --> 52:23.890
No, this is way bigger than us.

52:24.756 --> 52:25.923
Okay.

52:31.863 --> 52:34.031
- Hello?
- <i>Yeah, this is Ted Patterson. You called?</i>

52:34.033 --> 52:36.033
Thanks for returning my call,
Mr. Patterson.

52:36.035 --> 52:37.901
<i>Okay, can you come
to my office?</i>

52:37.903 --> 52:40.370
- Yeah, of course.
- <i>Tomorrow, in the a.m.</i>

52:40.372 --> 52:41.707
Yeah, tomorrow morning's
perfect.

52:42.274 --> 52:43.910
- I'll call you later.
- Yeah, cool.

52:44.343 --> 52:47.414
- <i>You know where it is?</i>
- Yeah, I'll see you then.

53:11.803 --> 53:12.705
I'm sorry.

53:13.305 --> 53:14.837
I'm here to see
Ted Patterson.

53:14.839 --> 53:15.908
Yeah, your name?

53:16.341 --> 53:17.640
Martin Duran.

53:17.642 --> 53:19.008
Can I offer you anything
to drink?

53:19.010 --> 53:20.410
No, thanks.

53:20.412 --> 53:22.312
Okay, right this way.

53:22.314 --> 53:24.381
- That's a cool accent.
- Thank you.

53:24.383 --> 53:25.551
Where are you from?

53:25.885 --> 53:27.354
- Brooklyn.
- All right.

53:29.455 --> 53:30.991
Martin Duran is here.

53:31.957 --> 53:33.292
All right, send him in.

53:35.361 --> 53:36.663
Mr. Duran, how you doing?

53:37.964 --> 53:39.562
- I'm all right.
- Do you need anything else?

53:39.564 --> 53:40.934
Yes, actually.

53:44.002 --> 53:44.937
Shred it.

53:52.944 --> 53:55.111
Thank you for seeing me,
Mr. Patterson.

53:55.113 --> 53:57.881
Yeah, no problem.
Call me Ted, have a seat.

53:57.883 --> 54:01.488
I promise, there is a madness
to my method here.

54:01.720 --> 54:03.856
I was just finishing up
your request right now.

54:06.559 --> 54:08.861
- That's it?
- In all her glory.

54:09.928 --> 54:12.562
I just have a few questions.

54:12.564 --> 54:15.434
That won't be necessary.
Everything you need is somewhere in there.

54:16.602 --> 54:17.734
Thank you.

54:17.736 --> 54:19.435
Though, I'm curious.

54:19.437 --> 54:21.441
Does the name Carcasse
mean anything to you?

54:23.042 --> 54:23.943
No, why?

54:25.010 --> 54:27.044
Well, Janice from the bank,
she mentioned you...

54:27.046 --> 54:30.783
you said Carcasse when she
was filing the CIP report.

54:31.015 --> 54:32.519
Janice from the bank...

54:33.084 --> 54:34.920
Oh, Janice, well...

54:35.521 --> 54:37.790
I think you and I can both agree
that she is not

54:38.057 --> 54:39.689
the sharpest knife
in the drawer.

54:39.691 --> 54:41.125
That's not necessary.

54:41.127 --> 54:42.729
What's not necessary?

54:44.497 --> 54:45.765
I meant no offense.

54:46.064 --> 54:50.633
So you're saying you never
mentioned Carcasse to her?

54:50.635 --> 54:52.703
No, I'm just saying Janice is
a very sick woman

54:52.705 --> 54:55.071
and I bet a lot of things that
she's saying right now are...

54:55.073 --> 54:56.975
not really based in reality,
right?

54:57.642 --> 54:59.713
But hey, you want clarity, huh?

55:01.147 --> 55:02.882
You should probably go talk
to Janice.

55:03.415 --> 55:04.551
Yeah.

55:08.720 --> 55:09.755
Hey, kid.

55:11.624 --> 55:14.026
Why are you acting like
such a fucking cowboy, huh?

55:15.428 --> 55:17.060
- What do...
- Does it make you feel like a big man

55:17.062 --> 55:18.995
to walk around this town like
a hotshot from the city,

55:18.997 --> 55:20.599
auditing people's lives?

55:21.700 --> 55:23.100
Let me tell you something.

55:23.102 --> 55:25.002
The Endelman Gallery?

55:25.004 --> 55:26.740
That's the best thing to happen
to this town in a long time.

55:27.539 --> 55:29.675
You're acting like you want
to find something wrong with it.

55:30.142 --> 55:31.845
With all due respect...

55:32.944 --> 55:34.747
you're acting like I'm going to.

55:37.850 --> 55:39.783
Hey, I get it.
I hated my daddy, too.

55:39.785 --> 55:42.586
You know? Fucking loser
who couldn't hang on to a dollar

55:42.588 --> 55:43.921
unless you nailed it
to his hand.

55:43.923 --> 55:45.125
Don't...

55:46.057 --> 55:47.559
talk about my family.

55:48.961 --> 55:51.964
You don't know anything about me
or my father.

55:53.064 --> 55:54.434
Well...

55:55.066 --> 55:58.167
I do know that
he was offered seven figures

55:58.169 --> 55:59.805
for that starve-acre farm
of his.

56:00.872 --> 56:02.205
I had a client
who was interested.

56:02.207 --> 56:04.410
I mean, you and me,
we're both money guys.

56:04.910 --> 56:06.977
You know that that was
an offer of a lifetime.

56:06.979 --> 56:09.415
He's never going to get another
offer like that again.

56:10.548 --> 56:11.984
Seven figures.

56:13.986 --> 56:15.989
But guys like your daddy...

56:16.988 --> 56:19.191
they were born to work
in the dust and the mud.

56:24.229 --> 56:25.865
They're tough
and they're stubborn.

56:29.234 --> 56:31.437
They're just fucking clueless,
am I right?

56:34.939 --> 56:36.142
Yeah.

57:09.975 --> 57:11.211
There we go.

57:23.821 --> 57:25.825
- What?
- Seven figures.

57:26.559 --> 57:28.058
Seven fucking figures.

57:28.060 --> 57:29.929
I don't understand how
you could turn that down.

57:30.595 --> 57:32.162
Well, seeing as how
this is my fucking farm,

57:32.164 --> 57:34.501
I'm not quite sure how
that's any of your business.

57:34.800 --> 57:36.135
But I can see you need it.

57:36.568 --> 57:38.634
So I'm going to fill you in
on a couple of things.

57:38.636 --> 57:39.805
Your brother...

57:40.705 --> 57:42.508
he's not the same
since he got back.

57:44.276 --> 57:47.080
Every lit match is
a forest fire to him now.

57:48.113 --> 57:49.345
Then get him help.

57:49.347 --> 57:51.250
Aw, Jesus,
there's a good idea.

57:51.883 --> 57:53.850
He won't keep his appointments
at the VA.

57:53.852 --> 57:55.718
Hell, he won't even go
to any of his meetings.

57:55.720 --> 57:58.123
He just shoots his guns
and drinks, that's it.

57:59.091 --> 58:00.593
As long as I'm alive,

58:00.959 --> 58:03.359
I make goddamn sure
he's got somewhere to land.

58:03.361 --> 58:04.630
Every day.

58:05.597 --> 58:07.800
So, yeah. Yeah,
I turned that money down.

58:10.803 --> 58:12.839
- So what are you going to do?
- I ought to just...

58:13.305 --> 58:15.605
Try and get what survived
the frost, picked and sold,

58:15.607 --> 58:16.843
keep our heads above water.

58:17.109 --> 58:19.176
Looks like there's another
cold snap coming in, too.

58:19.178 --> 58:21.047
So if you're not here to help...

58:21.780 --> 58:23.550
- I got it.
- Thank you.

58:32.790 --> 58:36.062
What pisses you off so much about
me going to make a life for myself?

58:41.834 --> 58:42.902
What?

58:43.702 --> 58:44.801
Nothing.

58:44.803 --> 58:47.640
Then what is it?
What did I do?

58:49.707 --> 58:52.177
You could have waited until we
put your mother in the ground.

58:54.312 --> 58:56.081
Oh, I abandoned you?

58:57.149 --> 58:58.818
Don't make me laugh.

59:01.086 --> 59:02.155
Where were you?

59:03.187 --> 59:05.023
While Mom was sick in bed,

59:05.390 --> 59:07.659
Caleb was in Iraq,
where were you?

59:07.859 --> 59:11.662
All that shit they were pumping into
her body had to be paid for, asshole.

59:11.664 --> 59:13.966
I had to do it.
I was out here!

59:15.901 --> 59:17.203
Yeah, and the Gin Mill.

59:17.970 --> 59:20.673
Oh, for Christ's sake,
the Gin Mill.

59:21.839 --> 59:23.675
The fucking Gin Mill.

59:29.682 --> 59:30.850
You know, junior...

59:32.251 --> 59:34.754
I like to think you're the smartest
guy I know, that's the truth.

59:36.088 --> 59:39.288
But when a woman you shared a bed with
for 22 years is told she's a goner

59:39.290 --> 59:41.024
and there's not a thing
you can do about it,

59:41.026 --> 59:44.297
well, you just handle it
the best way you can think of.

59:45.863 --> 59:47.300
Spend a little time
at the Gin Mill.

59:47.832 --> 59:49.068
It seemed like a good idea.

59:50.035 --> 59:52.038
It just always turned into
a lot of time.

59:53.238 --> 59:54.674
That's all.

59:56.374 --> 59:57.909
Never enough.

01:00:02.847 --> 01:00:05.117
You'd have handled that
a lot different.

01:00:09.455 --> 01:00:11.090
You'd have handled that
a lot better.

01:00:18.497 --> 01:00:19.999
You know something, junior?

01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:24.336
Smart as you are, I thought you'd
have figured that one out by now.

01:01:13.452 --> 01:01:14.486
Try to keep up.

01:01:15.988 --> 01:01:18.091
You might want to rethink
your footwear next time.

01:01:22.794 --> 01:01:25.798
Penelope mentioned you met
with Ted. How was that?

01:01:26.164 --> 01:01:27.464
You were definitely right
about him.

01:01:27.466 --> 01:01:29.299
The guy's
a real piece of work.

01:01:29.301 --> 01:01:32.038
I said something about Endelman
and he got kind of aggressive.

01:01:32.437 --> 01:01:33.937
What did you say?

01:01:33.939 --> 01:01:35.441
Just the word "Carcasse."

01:01:36.908 --> 01:01:39.042
What's that?

01:01:39.044 --> 01:01:41.314
I have no idea. It's the one thing
Janice remembers clearly and...

01:01:41.879 --> 01:01:43.249
Ted wishes she'd forget.

01:01:44.082 --> 01:01:45.917
I thought you might know
something about it.

01:01:46.185 --> 01:01:48.287
No, Penelope deals
with him directly.

01:01:49.388 --> 01:01:52.122
I'm getting a whiff of mild
conspiracy coming off of you.

01:01:52.124 --> 01:01:54.861
Maybe you've been hanging out
with your Bitcoin buddy too much.

01:01:55.827 --> 01:01:57.095
Come on, it's not much further.

01:02:23.021 --> 01:02:24.957
That song you sang
the other night,

01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:28.193
you said it was
your mom's favorite.

01:02:29.227 --> 01:02:31.897
Yeah, she sang it
all the time.

01:02:34.899 --> 01:02:36.135
She...

01:02:36.401 --> 01:02:38.337
passed away recently.

01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:43.376
Made some bad choices
about how to cope with life.

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:46.245
I'm really sorry.

01:02:48.946 --> 01:02:50.816
I lost my mom, too.

01:02:52.251 --> 01:02:53.486
It was a while ago.

01:02:55.653 --> 01:02:57.155
It still hurts.

01:02:58.122 --> 01:02:59.325
Yeah.

01:03:03.028 --> 01:03:04.930
What is it about
a good view...

01:03:06.164 --> 01:03:08.100
that just makes people want
to talk?

01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:12.305
I always think about her
when I come up here.

01:03:15.207 --> 01:03:17.009
You used to
come here together?

01:03:20.144 --> 01:03:21.280
No, never.

01:03:29.287 --> 01:03:32.157
I know all of you are probably
having some pretty strong emotions.

01:03:33.091 --> 01:03:35.194
If anybody wants to talk,
let me know.

01:03:48.573 --> 01:03:50.006
Did you hear?

01:03:50.008 --> 01:03:51.276
What's going on?

01:03:51.676 --> 01:03:53.546
Janice... she died.

01:03:54.446 --> 01:03:57.283
I just saw her.
What happened?

01:03:58.082 --> 01:03:59.584
They're saying it was
an assisted suicide.

01:04:00.484 --> 01:04:02.488
But they're
still investigating.

01:04:04.189 --> 01:04:06.158
I'm... sorry.

01:04:07.024 --> 01:04:08.227
Thanks.

01:04:33.118 --> 01:04:34.718
This place is almost as dark
as my office.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.955
The fuck are you doing here?

01:04:38.289 --> 01:04:39.958
I'm going to give you
what I found, but then I'm out.

01:04:41.493 --> 01:04:43.392
I don't want anything more to do with
this, and I don't get deposed, okay?

01:04:43.394 --> 01:04:44.629
Just slow down.

01:04:45.097 --> 01:04:46.395
Now what are you talking about?

01:04:46.397 --> 01:04:47.700
I'm a ghost in this.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:49.432
Promise?

01:04:49.434 --> 01:04:51.202
Okay, I promise.

01:04:56.508 --> 01:04:59.377
For the sake of getting
everything, I recorded my screen.

01:05:01.747 --> 01:05:06.616
<i>Okay, running monitor
darkly script on Carcasse Bait and Tackle.</i>

01:05:06.618 --> 01:05:08.084
What am I looking at here?

01:05:08.086 --> 01:05:09.618
Just wait,
I'm about to tell you.

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:13.355
<i>On a computer, if you want
to peep, just go to the source.</i>

01:05:13.357 --> 01:05:14.493
<i>The monitor.</i>

01:05:14.725 --> 01:05:17.530
<i>Okay, that's a little creepy.</i>

01:05:18.363 --> 01:05:21.000
<i>Running motion detection
in the BG.</i>

01:05:21.665 --> 01:05:23.133
<i>Looks like we got some action.</i>

01:05:25.569 --> 01:05:27.673
<i>Let's see what the fine patrons of
Carcasse Bait Shop use their bandwidth for.</i>

01:05:28.339 --> 01:05:30.142
<i>All right, what's that?</i>

01:05:32.044 --> 01:05:33.412
<i>"Come and get it"...</i>

01:05:34.312 --> 01:05:35.146
<i>in Russian.</i>

01:05:38.682 --> 01:05:41.519
<i>Okay. I've got
a few more accounts.</i>

01:05:42.486 --> 01:05:45.992
<i>Now it looks like our subject is
sending ruble to various accounts.</i>

01:05:47.325 --> 01:05:49.792
<i>Looks like he's receiving
Bitcoin, four different accounts.</i>

01:05:49.794 --> 01:05:51.664
<i>Checking ruble-to-Bitcoin
exchange rate...</i>

01:05:52.798 --> 01:05:54.600
<i>Yep, for the exact amount
he sent in rubles.</i>

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.167
<i>But the accounts he's receiving from
are different than the ones he sent to.</i>

01:05:58.169 --> 01:05:59.435
A currency tumbler.

01:05:59.437 --> 01:06:02.372
Yep. Digital Cayman Islands.

01:06:02.374 --> 01:06:04.274
<i>We're going to do a little bit
of sneaky shit here</i>

01:06:04.276 --> 01:06:05.711
<i>and see if we can't find out
who they're selling to.</i>

01:06:06.644 --> 01:06:10.448
<i>Okay, now I just have to see
from whence these comrades came</i>

01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:14.386
<i>Oh, shit.
They're all coming from...</i>

01:06:14.752 --> 01:06:16.555
- <i>Carcasse.</i>
- Carcasse.

01:06:18.189 --> 01:06:20.593
<i>Which means we are now very likely
looking at a money laundering business.</i>

01:06:21.493 --> 01:06:22.595
Fuck.

01:06:24.629 --> 01:06:26.198
I'm not going any deeper.

01:06:27.832 --> 01:06:30.834
Remember that guy who came in
the other day asking for vodka?

01:06:30.836 --> 01:06:32.303
Yeah, I remember.

01:06:32.537 --> 01:06:34.372
Well, I looked it up.

01:06:34.839 --> 01:06:36.274
It doesn't exist.

01:06:41.113 --> 01:06:42.615
But it does link to this.

01:06:43.247 --> 01:06:44.716
A Russian gang.

01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:00.533
Fuck, just turn that off.

01:07:02.633 --> 01:07:05.167
This isn't white-collar shit
anymore, do you understand?

01:07:05.169 --> 01:07:08.173
This is "you get skinned alive
and have to watch" kind of collar.

01:07:08.874 --> 01:07:11.209
Knock, knock. Oh.

01:07:11.475 --> 01:07:13.542
Hey, sorry.
What's going on in here?

01:07:13.544 --> 01:07:16.081
Hey, man. Nothing,
just IT stuff.

01:07:16.281 --> 01:07:18.384
This guy needs to stop watching
so much porn.

01:07:20.185 --> 01:07:21.387
You too, by the way.

01:07:21.685 --> 01:07:23.789
No judgment.
Just some friendly advice.

01:07:27.392 --> 01:07:30.261
Um... the girl
from Endelman called.

01:07:30.562 --> 01:07:31.764
She was hoping
you'd stop by.

01:07:32.196 --> 01:07:33.432
All right, thanks.

01:07:35.332 --> 01:07:36.501
Katie!

01:07:37.769 --> 01:07:39.205
Hello?

01:07:45.443 --> 01:07:47.879
Hey, I'm sorry.
Have you seen Katie?

01:07:50.515 --> 01:07:51.684
What do you think?

01:07:52.684 --> 01:07:54.683
I'm not really qualified
to say.

01:07:55.819 --> 01:07:57.122
- I think Katie...
- Your...

01:07:57.888 --> 01:08:00.693
country mouse act is so dreary.

01:08:01.626 --> 01:08:04.763
I saw right through it the first time
you walked in, in that outlet mall suit.

01:08:05.763 --> 01:08:07.499
You're a very clever boy.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.801
Indulge me.

01:08:14.606 --> 01:08:16.242
It makes me feel...

01:08:16.807 --> 01:08:18.144
lonely.

01:08:19.944 --> 01:08:22.413
Like my life is outside of me.

01:08:23.214 --> 01:08:24.448
It's a giant fucking mess.

01:08:28.787 --> 01:08:30.256
Or...

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:34.292
is life very mysterious?

01:08:34.892 --> 01:08:36.294
And remote?

01:08:36.761 --> 01:08:38.531
And it's we who are the mess?

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:41.531
This is like
the million-dollar question.

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:42.801
Eight million.

01:08:44.336 --> 01:08:48.173
Mr. Hiroshito paid $8 million
just last night.

01:08:48.872 --> 01:08:50.276
Well, that's incredible.

01:08:50.573 --> 01:08:51.809
Congratulations.

01:08:52.776 --> 01:08:54.546
So is Katie here?

01:08:55.747 --> 01:08:57.448
She didn't come to work today.

01:08:58.682 --> 01:08:59.850
I called you.

01:09:01.019 --> 01:09:02.453
You?

01:09:03.953 --> 01:09:05.290
Why?

01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:07.593
'Cause you've been asking
some...

01:09:08.426 --> 01:09:10.495
really tough questions.

01:09:10.962 --> 01:09:12.964
Like what?

01:09:14.832 --> 01:09:16.635
I like you, Marty Duran.

01:09:18.636 --> 01:09:20.238
Or do you prefer Martin?

01:09:20.904 --> 01:09:23.438
One's a country mouse,
one's a town mouse.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:25.644
What is it that
the fable teaches us? That...

01:09:26.278 --> 01:09:28.247
poverty with security...

01:09:29.546 --> 01:09:33.519
is better than plenty in the
midst of fear and uncertainty.

01:09:34.852 --> 01:09:36.854
Wouldn't it be nice
if life were that simple?

01:09:37.622 --> 01:09:39.425
Stop with the fucking riddles.

01:09:40.591 --> 01:09:41.794
Talk to me.

01:09:43.993 --> 01:09:45.395
A simple life...

01:09:46.897 --> 01:09:49.600
A simple life is just
a myth now, it's...

01:09:50.334 --> 01:09:51.636
There's no...

01:09:51.836 --> 01:09:54.440
There's no returning
to the country, it's...

01:09:55.539 --> 01:09:57.810
There's just the back door
that evil uses.

01:10:00.011 --> 01:10:01.847
What do you know about Carcasse?

01:10:03.614 --> 01:10:04.816
What do you know?

01:10:14.325 --> 01:10:15.560
Enjoy this.

01:10:16.828 --> 01:10:18.263
From one...

01:10:19.564 --> 01:10:21.033
town mouse to another.

01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:27.605
Penelope.

01:11:24.128 --> 01:11:25.596
Holy shit.

01:11:28.098 --> 01:11:29.435
Fucking...

01:11:36.507 --> 01:11:38.910
<i>You
know who I am and what to do.</i>

01:11:39.476 --> 01:11:41.646
Look, Katie,
I need to talk to you. Just...

01:11:42.646 --> 01:11:44.179
Just call me back.

01:11:44.181 --> 01:11:45.617
Fucking...

01:11:50.754 --> 01:11:51.923
What do I do?

01:12:00.431 --> 01:12:01.997
- <i>Martin?</i>
- Now, Robin.

01:12:01.999 --> 01:12:03.899
We have a serious problem here.

01:12:03.901 --> 01:12:05.069
<i>Okay, what's going on?</i>

01:12:07.571 --> 01:12:08.806
<i>What? Say it.</i>

01:12:10.742 --> 01:12:12.875
I'm pretty sure the Russian
Mafia is laundering money

01:12:12.877 --> 01:12:14.079
through the Omni branch here.

01:12:14.878 --> 01:12:17.515
<i>The Russian Mafia... in Elba?</i>

01:12:17.949 --> 01:12:19.451
<i>Are you joking?</i>

01:12:22.854 --> 01:12:24.690
<i>Martin, are you serious?</i>

01:12:25.123 --> 01:12:27.156
Yes.

01:12:27.158 --> 01:12:29.992
They're smuggling artwork into a
local gallery here to wash their money

01:12:29.994 --> 01:12:31.126
and we're helping them do it.

01:12:31.128 --> 01:12:32.194
<i>Okay, do you have proof?</i>

01:12:32.196 --> 01:12:34.165
Some, yeah.

01:12:34.665 --> 01:12:36.534
<i>Jesus Christ, okay, uh...</i>

01:12:37.534 --> 01:12:38.770
<i>Look, send me everything
you have.</i>

01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:41.006
<i>Get back to your hotel,
get your things.</i>

01:12:41.638 --> 01:12:43.840
- <i>Get back here by tomorrow.</i>
- Okay.

01:12:43.842 --> 01:12:46.645
<i>In the meantime,
I'll start setting up internal controls.</i>

01:12:46.977 --> 01:12:48.911
<i>And, Martin, stay in your lane.</i>

01:12:48.913 --> 01:12:51.080
<i>Okay? Don't go rogue.
We got to do this right.</i>

01:12:51.082 --> 01:12:52.584
I understand.

01:13:03.994 --> 01:13:07.529
<i>...major system that's
stalled. What this means in English</i>

01:13:07.531 --> 01:13:09.732
<i>is another late cold snap
is on its way.</i>

01:13:09.734 --> 01:13:12.501
<i>And that's causing havoc
for farmers in the area.</i>

01:13:12.503 --> 01:13:15.039
<i>This time last year, we were
having great winter crop harvest...</i>

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:53.244
Here it comes.

01:14:31.348 --> 01:14:32.950
That's the last of it.

01:16:19.222 --> 01:16:20.292
Leaving the heavy ones
for me?

01:17:05.235 --> 01:17:06.671
Well...

01:17:08.839 --> 01:17:10.275
I'm going to get
a little shut-eye.

01:17:18.248 --> 01:17:19.684
Appreciate it.

01:17:20.485 --> 01:17:22.354
A lot better than
a pop on the nose.

01:17:36.234 --> 01:17:37.436
I'm hungry.

01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:40.172
Yeah.

01:18:04.195 --> 01:18:05.230
Hmm.

01:18:08.031 --> 01:18:09.501
<i>You didn't have to come help.</i>

01:18:11.068 --> 01:18:12.268
I know.

01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:13.872
What, came back to be
a hero?

01:18:18.176 --> 01:18:20.245
If you have something
to say to me, just say it.

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:27.385
Three months I was lying in a
hospital bed in Germany by myself.

01:18:30.187 --> 01:18:31.890
Not a fucking word from you.

01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:36.492
Did you even know?
Did you even care?

01:18:36.494 --> 01:18:37.996
Of course I did.

01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:40.798
Then why?

01:18:42.132 --> 01:18:43.400
I was angry.

01:18:44.001 --> 01:18:45.870
About everything, everybody.

01:18:47.337 --> 01:18:49.173
I needed to get
the fuck out of here.

01:18:50.473 --> 01:18:52.543
I thought I'd go to the city,

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:54.346
and make my own way.

01:18:56.614 --> 01:18:58.183
But honestly,

01:18:58.415 --> 01:18:59.985
it's the same shit.

01:19:00.517 --> 01:19:02.354
I work in a fucking basement.

01:19:02.954 --> 01:19:05.019
I still get pushed around
by jocks,

01:19:05.021 --> 01:19:07.458
only now they're wearing
$10,000 suits.

01:19:12.562 --> 01:19:13.998
Who are these guys?

01:19:14.931 --> 01:19:15.833
No one.

01:19:16.633 --> 01:19:19.068
Just a bunch
of Wall Street assholes.

01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:20.469
Seriously, give me their names.

01:19:20.471 --> 01:19:22.240
What are you going to do?

01:19:23.039 --> 01:19:25.441
You're going to drive to the city
and beat the shit out of them?

01:19:25.443 --> 01:19:27.076
I fucking might.

01:19:27.078 --> 01:19:28.544
I don't give a fuck.

01:19:33.150 --> 01:19:36.318
<i>In local news,
we have a report of another tragedy</i>

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.324
- <i>in the business community on the struggling east side...</i>
- Can you turn that up?

01:19:40.156 --> 01:19:44.126
<i>Van Loan's Discount Liquor,
an east side institution since the '70s,</i>

01:19:44.128 --> 01:19:45.597
<i>burned to the ground last night</i>

<i>Fire investigators will be

<i>before officially determining

01:19:51.302 --> 01:19:53.535
<i>But authorities at this point
are attributing it</i>

01:19:53.537 --> 01:19:56.173
<i>to faulty wiring in the

01:19:57.007 --> 01:19:59.942
<i>Tragically, the store's

<i>and was pronounced dead

01:20:04.614 --> 01:20:06.150
Jesus Christ.

01:20:06.449 --> 01:20:08.986
Structure fire and an OD,
all in one night.

01:20:09.552 --> 01:20:11.422
What the hell is happening
to this town?

01:20:13.423 --> 01:20:14.359
Who OD'd?

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.863
The wild lady from the gallery.

01:20:18.262 --> 01:20:20.432
She bit off her own tongue.

01:20:20.698 --> 01:20:23.933
<i>Officials will be conducting an autopsy
on the deceased as soon as possible</i>

01:20:23.935 --> 01:20:25.667
<i>in order to rule out

<i>The building is...</i>

01:20:27.939 --> 01:20:30.075
Will you turn
the fucking TV off?

01:20:44.488 --> 01:20:46.124
Marty, what
the fuck's going on?

01:20:47.391 --> 01:20:48.526
I don't know.

01:21:52.056 --> 01:21:54.023
- Jesus Christ!
- Hey, man. I'm sorry.

01:21:54.025 --> 01:21:55.657
- What the fuck are you doing in here?
- I didn't mean to scare you, I...

01:21:55.659 --> 01:21:57.526
You just walk
into somebody's room?

01:21:57.528 --> 01:21:59.564
Man, your door was open.
I just need your signature.

01:21:59.797 --> 01:22:02.133
- Are you Martin Duran?
- Who's it from?

01:22:02.466 --> 01:22:04.336
It's a blind shipment.
I have no idea.

01:22:04.769 --> 01:22:07.472
I just need you to sign for it.
Number six, right there.

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:17.548
I'm keeping your pen.

01:22:18.082 --> 01:22:19.316
Asshole.

01:23:36.659 --> 01:23:38.162
Too easy, Earl.

01:23:45.769 --> 01:23:47.372
<i>Hey, Marty.</i>

01:23:47.738 --> 01:23:49.406
<i>If you're getting this,</i>

01:23:50.473 --> 01:23:52.110
<i>I'm dead.</i>

01:23:53.744 --> 01:23:54.876
<i>I know I told you I didn't want to
be involved with any of this anymore,</i>

01:23:54.878 --> 01:23:56.314
<i>but I guess it's too late.</i>

01:23:58.615 --> 01:24:00.349
<i>Screenshot this,</i>

01:24:00.351 --> 01:24:02.587
<i>print it out,
and guard it with your life.</i>

01:24:03.553 --> 01:24:06.156
<i>These are the keys
to my digital wallet.</i>

01:24:07.690 --> 01:24:09.657
<i>I know you don't know jack shit
about crypto,</i>

01:24:09.659 --> 01:24:12.329
<i>but I can give you three millio
reasons why you should learn.</i>

01:24:12.663 --> 01:24:15.133
<i>'Cause I just shipped you
all my mining gear.</i>

01:24:15.833 --> 01:24:17.135
<i>Okay.</i>

01:24:17.601 --> 01:24:19.504
<i>This is the really
important part.</i>

01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:23.274
<i>You need to get this stuff
organized and out there.</i>

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.441
<i>I'd say give it to WikiLeaks,
but I don't know,</i>

01:24:26.443 --> 01:24:27.712
<i>half of that stuff is BS now.</i>

01:24:28.779 --> 01:24:30.515
<i>I'll leave it
to your discretion.</i>

01:24:35.653 --> 01:24:37.754
Viva la revolución.

01:26:12.882 --> 01:26:15.653
- Hello?
- <i>Martin, you need to get to the farm, now.</i>

01:26:15.953 --> 01:26:17.789
- Caleb?
- <i>Just get to the farm.</i>

01:26:18.422 --> 01:26:19.891
Caleb! Shit.

01:26:21.592 --> 01:26:22.560
Shit.

01:26:34.672 --> 01:26:37.542
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Drew... Drew, it's Martin Duran.

01:26:37.807 --> 01:26:39.810
- <i>Hey, Marty.</i>
- Yeah, man, I need a ride.

01:26:49.887 --> 01:26:51.256
What's going on?

01:26:51.488 --> 01:26:53.324
- And where's Dad?
- He's not here.

01:26:53.589 --> 01:26:55.392
I came home and I found this
on the porch.

01:27:04.935 --> 01:27:06.437
Is that a tongue?

01:27:08.038 --> 01:27:10.339
What the fuck is going on?
Where's Dad?

01:27:10.341 --> 01:27:11.743
Is that an actual tongue?

01:27:12.008 --> 01:27:14.645
- Whose tongue is that?
- What time is it?

01:27:15.044 --> 01:27:16.513
You know who did this?

01:27:16.747 --> 01:27:18.045
These people are dangerous.

01:27:18.047 --> 01:27:19.113
Whose fucking tongue is that?

01:27:19.115 --> 01:27:20.651
What time is it?

01:27:20.883 --> 01:27:22.720
It's 2:37.

01:27:23.354 --> 01:27:25.890
- Just let me think for a second.
- Fuck that!

01:27:26.923 --> 01:27:28.760
That's not Dad's tongue, Caleb.

01:27:29.126 --> 01:27:31.061
Then who the fuck's
tongue is that?

01:27:31.994 --> 01:27:33.297
Caleb!

01:27:33.529 --> 01:27:34.831
Just wait a second.

01:27:35.766 --> 01:27:37.502
Caleb, stop and listen to me.

01:27:38.369 --> 01:27:39.570
Just look at me.

01:27:40.104 --> 01:27:41.306
Caleb...

01:27:42.004 --> 01:27:43.074
Get out of the way.

01:27:48.011 --> 01:27:49.681
You're pointing
a gun at me.

01:27:51.047 --> 01:27:53.517
It's almost 3:00.
They have Dad.

01:27:54.418 --> 01:27:56.354
Get the fuck out of the way.

01:27:59.856 --> 01:28:01.391
We're going
to get him back.

01:28:03.793 --> 01:28:05.495
But we need
to be smart.

01:28:14.937 --> 01:28:16.440
Hey, it's Marty.

01:28:17.675 --> 01:28:19.110
This is either the smartest
phone call I've ever made...

01:28:19.943 --> 01:28:21.079
or the dumbest.

01:28:46.837 --> 01:28:47.939
Now get in the truck.

01:28:49.205 --> 01:28:50.738
You all right?

01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:52.443
They broke my arm.

01:28:54.778 --> 01:28:55.812
Oops.

01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.550
Maybe you're not
so fucking smart.

01:29:05.221 --> 01:29:06.757
So, I...

01:29:08.092 --> 01:29:09.057
I assume that you're going to tell
me that you made copies of that

01:29:09.059 --> 01:29:10.494
or something, right?

01:29:11.494 --> 01:29:12.696
Yeah, I did.

01:29:14.131 --> 01:29:15.732
And if I don't call my brother

01:29:16.533 --> 01:29:18.636
and tell him my dad
and I are okay...

01:29:19.837 --> 01:29:21.739
he drops
the files everywhere.

01:29:22.672 --> 01:29:24.608
FBI, DEA,

01:29:25.042 --> 01:29:26.177
everywhere.

01:29:29.178 --> 01:29:30.580
You know what, cowboy?

01:29:31.013 --> 01:29:32.917
I don't think you had time
to make copies.

01:29:33.217 --> 01:29:34.619
So go ahead and call him.

01:29:35.485 --> 01:29:37.421
Tell him you're not
going to be okay.

01:29:40.022 --> 01:29:41.525
Call him.

01:30:07.184 --> 01:30:09.220
Now, I'd be very careful
what you do next.

01:30:10.988 --> 01:30:12.088
Knowing my brother,

01:30:12.788 --> 01:30:14.758
every lit match is
a forest fire.

01:30:18.529 --> 01:30:19.664
- Hey, hey.
- Easy.

01:30:19.863 --> 01:30:21.699
Hey, just calm the fuck down.

01:30:25.702 --> 01:30:26.771
Hey...

01:30:27.037 --> 01:30:30.071
let's just talk about
this, okay?

01:30:30.073 --> 01:30:31.042
Yeah?

01:30:32.142 --> 01:30:34.779
You and me,
we're both still money guys, right?

01:30:35.779 --> 01:30:37.815
Your dad's farm,
the seven figures?

01:30:38.181 --> 01:30:39.584
I can make that happen.

01:30:41.784 --> 01:30:43.787
We can all walk away
from here happy.

01:30:44.253 --> 01:30:45.655
Yeah?

01:30:49.092 --> 01:30:50.795
You're so fucked.

01:31:07.977 --> 01:31:09.577
FBI, on the ground!

01:31:09.579 --> 01:31:10.814
Get on the ground!

01:31:11.614 --> 01:31:13.814
Drop the weapon,
get on the ground now.

01:31:13.816 --> 01:31:16.753
Spread your legs,
keep your hands where I can see them.

01:31:23.994 --> 01:31:25.263
There they go.

01:31:29.098 --> 01:31:30.200
Hands behind your back.

01:31:32.101 --> 01:31:33.203
Oops.

01:31:34.770 --> 01:31:37.371
- This won't change anything.
- Get up.

01:31:37.373 --> 01:31:39.976
<i>We have two suspects fleeing
the scene on foot. We are in pursuit.</i>

01:31:40.877 --> 01:31:41.846
FBI!

01:31:42.111 --> 01:31:43.812
Get down!
Let me see your hands.

01:31:45.649 --> 01:31:47.151
Stop!

01:31:52.756 --> 01:31:55.726
- Look, I didn't...
- Junior, I don't think I want to know.

01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:58.262
Get him some help?

01:31:59.195 --> 01:32:00.897
Yeah, he took
my boots.

01:32:01.297 --> 01:32:03.264
Goddamn busted arm.

01:32:03.266 --> 01:32:04.769
Where's Caleb?

01:32:06.369 --> 01:32:07.704
Clear on your six!

01:32:07.971 --> 01:32:09.006
Cover that door.

01:32:09.905 --> 01:32:11.943
Check that door for me, Ken.

01:32:19.281 --> 01:32:20.650
FBI!

01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:22.052
Clear.

01:32:33.195 --> 01:32:34.364
Clear, go.

01:32:34.765 --> 01:32:35.967
FBI!

01:32:40.369 --> 01:32:41.972
- You hit?
- I'm okay.

01:32:45.007 --> 01:32:47.010
- <i>Shots fired!</i>
- <i>10-4.</i>

01:32:48.712 --> 01:32:50.181
<i>Seven, do a sweep of the sector</i>

01:33:24.213 --> 01:33:25.783
FBI! On the ground.

01:33:26.016 --> 01:33:27.752
Drop the gun, drop the gun!

01:33:28.318 --> 01:33:29.349
Get down.

01:33:29.351 --> 01:33:30.354
He's with me!

01:33:30.854 --> 01:33:32.720
- Copy, stand down.
- Stand down.

01:33:42.132 --> 01:33:44.499
- Can I ask you some questions?
- Sure, go ahead.

01:33:44.501 --> 01:33:46.201
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:33:46.203 --> 01:33:47.835
How's the arm?

01:33:47.837 --> 01:33:49.372
It's good. It's all right.
It's not hurting.

01:33:50.006 --> 01:33:51.142
Anything else hurting?

01:33:51.408 --> 01:33:52.943
No. I'm good.

01:33:53.409 --> 01:33:55.145
Your brother
was a hero today.

01:33:58.381 --> 01:33:59.883
Yeah.

01:34:03.386 --> 01:34:04.855
How did you find out
about me?

01:34:08.190 --> 01:34:10.461
You said you lived in upstate
for two years.

01:34:11.828 --> 01:34:13.964
But your bank account's
six months old.

01:34:15.498 --> 01:34:18.202
It was air-tight,
just not to me.

01:34:21.104 --> 01:34:22.373
But I figured...

01:34:24.341 --> 01:34:26.410
you're either
a really bad criminal...

01:34:28.211 --> 01:34:29.480
or you're undercover.

01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:38.489
I do have one question.

01:34:40.957 --> 01:34:42.426
Did your mom really die?

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:45.729
She retired.

01:34:46.562 --> 01:34:48.065
Moved to Fresno.

01:34:51.133 --> 01:34:53.303
So she did make bad choices.

01:34:56.306 --> 01:34:57.408
I'm sorry.

01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:02.812
You'd think
it gets easier, but...

01:35:04.079 --> 01:35:07.318
the lies just
keep getting harder.

01:35:12.189 --> 01:35:14.225
I have to get back
to the city.

01:35:16.293 --> 01:35:17.528
Look me up sometime.

01:35:23.533 --> 01:35:25.102
I don't know
your real name.

01:35:26.035 --> 01:35:27.404
You're a smart guy, Marty.

01:35:35.579 --> 01:35:37.448
Any idea how long you were
in the van?

01:35:39.915 --> 01:35:41.515
- Hmm?
- How long?

01:35:41.517 --> 01:35:43.952
I don't know,
maybe a half hour or something.

01:35:43.954 --> 01:35:46.557
Maybe an hour. They had the bag over
my head, so I didn't see anything.

01:35:49.124 --> 01:35:51.895
<i>It's uncertain to me
how high these conspiracies go.</i>

01:35:52.462 --> 01:35:54.899
So forgive me if you know
what I'm about to say.

01:35:55.931 --> 01:35:58.234
But during my investigation
of the Elba branch,

01:35:58.501 --> 01:36:02.806
I discovered that OmniBank maintained
several dark accounts of cryptocurrency.

01:36:03.539 --> 01:36:06.476
Furthermore, an employee of the
bank has been using these funds

01:36:06.976 --> 01:36:10.013
in various illicit activities
with the Russian Mafia.

01:36:11.381 --> 01:36:15.985
Robin Whiting, my boss and
chief AML officer at OmniBank,

01:36:16.352 --> 01:36:19.256
has been enriching
her shareholders and herself

01:36:20.123 --> 01:36:24.395
through racketeering, kickbacks from
cyber ransoms, money laundering,

01:36:25.128 --> 01:36:26.397
murder.

01:36:27.329 --> 01:36:29.065
Can you prove any of this?

01:36:29.632 --> 01:36:31.068
I can.

01:36:36.573 --> 01:36:38.275
It's all right here.

01:36:39.208 --> 01:36:40.410
Everything.

01:36:41.977 --> 01:36:43.614
Courtesy of Earl Simmons.

01:36:45.414 --> 01:36:47.117
A true friend and hero.

01:36:53.155 --> 01:36:54.190
What is that?

01:37:01.498 --> 01:37:02.433
Martin.

01:37:03.533 --> 01:37:05.599
What happened in there?
How'd it go?

01:37:05.601 --> 01:37:08.338
Really well. I stayed in my
lane, just like you told me to.

01:37:08.538 --> 01:37:12.040
Good. Good, we wouldn't want you
to get exiled again like...

01:37:12.042 --> 01:37:13.977
Who was it you said?
Napoleon?

01:37:15.678 --> 01:37:18.047
Do you know what happened to Napoleon after
he was banished to the island of Elba?

01:37:20.283 --> 01:37:23.053
He escaped
and recaptured France.

01:37:23.552 --> 01:37:24.652
Oh.

01:37:24.654 --> 01:37:26.257
And, Robin...

01:37:26.722 --> 01:37:28.993
a word of advice
from a friend.

01:37:30.193 --> 01:37:32.363
When you talk with them,
less is more.

01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:36.300
I think I'm fully equipped
to handle the board.

01:37:36.598 --> 01:37:38.101
But thank you, Martin.

01:37:38.368 --> 01:37:40.236
No, I'm not talking about
the board.

01:37:47.377 --> 01:37:49.280
Robin Whiting? FBI.

01:37:49.611 --> 01:37:50.647
You're under arrest.

01:37:51.146 --> 01:37:52.647
You've got to be kidding me.

01:37:52.649 --> 01:37:54.381
No, you have no...

01:37:54.383 --> 01:37:56.517
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:37:56.519 --> 01:37:58.219
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

01:37:58.221 --> 01:37:59.990
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:38:10.499 --> 01:38:11.568
Yo.

01:38:26.082 --> 01:38:27.618
- Marty!
- Jesus!

01:38:28.517 --> 01:38:29.720
Fuck.

01:38:31.788 --> 01:38:33.457
You scare pretty easy.

01:38:35.525 --> 01:38:37.628
This looks like fun.
You working hard?

01:38:38.628 --> 01:38:40.998
Yeah, you handle the farming.
I'll handle the mining.

01:38:41.330 --> 01:38:43.167
- You lazy bastard.
- Oh.

01:38:44.467 --> 01:38:46.267
I'm going to go shoot,
you want to come?

01:38:46.269 --> 01:38:47.338
No, I'm good.

01:38:47.803 --> 01:38:49.405
I'm going to head down
to the city.

01:38:50.539 --> 01:38:53.444
"I'm going to head
to the city." City?

01:38:55.544 --> 01:38:56.547
Wait.

01:38:58.547 --> 01:38:59.482
Oh.

01:39:03.386 --> 01:39:05.254
- Shut up.
- Why not?

01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:09.624
Remember your manners.

01:39:09.626 --> 01:39:10.694
Hell yeah.

01:39:16.732 --> 01:39:18.299
You have fun

Hey, I owe you one,
remember?

01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:32.682
Hey, call me!

01:39:33.182 --> 01:39:34.717
I'll be in the back
of your truck.
