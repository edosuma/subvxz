03:18.800 --> 03:21.326
A Mr. Ding came forward
with information after reading about...

03:21.400 --> 03:23.243
the murder in the newspaper.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.082
He said he saw Choi Dong Hen

03:27.120 --> 03:28.121
and his gang

03:28.160 --> 03:29.571
near the crime scene that night.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.880
We suspect Choi is connected to the murder.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.121
We're ready to arrest him

04:10.160 --> 04:11.605
for eyewitness ID.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.322
We also received information

04:17.360 --> 04:19.805
that Choi is taking on
the Russian Mafia in a turf war.

04:20.079 --> 04:22.924
I believe Choi is the most likely suspect.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.246
Take action now. Don't fail.

04:24.520 --> 04:25.328
Yes, sir.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.928
- What's going on?
- Stay right there!

04:33.960 --> 04:35.041
What's wrong?

04:37.200 --> 04:39.043
What's your relationship with the Russians?

04:44.400 --> 04:46.323
Sir, the witness is here.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.250
Listen Choi, we have an eyewitness.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.402
Mr. Ding, do you recognize him?

05:00.240 --> 05:01.526
When Mr. Ding reported the case,

05:01.720 --> 05:04.121
he was certain he saw Choi that night.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.330
But during the ID process,

05:06.600 --> 05:08.728
he hesitated and seemed unsure,

05:09.040 --> 05:11.281
and failed to identify Choi.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.771
Did you check his background?

05:14.080 --> 05:14.967
Perhaps he was threatened

05:15.000 --> 05:16.047
and afraid to say anything.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.567
He's a former Central Security Bureau agent.

05:18.640 --> 05:22.042
He retired and moved back here
from Beijing 6 months ago.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.366
He lives alone.

05:24.040 --> 05:27.601
He didn't appear to be
afraid during the lineup.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.969
We suspect he may have dementia.

05:38.200 --> 05:44.321
(Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
Old Ding is not at all that old.)

05:44.600 --> 05:50.164
(If he hollers, let him go.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.)

05:50.600 --> 05:55.083
(Cop A, B, C, D can't catch a thief.)

05:55.360 --> 06:00.127
(When that happens, Old Ding brings relief.)

06:01.840 --> 06:04.810
This Old Ding song swept across the nation

06:05.120 --> 06:09.045
while another Old Ding led
a quiet life, unnoticed.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.365
This Old Ding

06:12.320 --> 06:17.724
is a kind-hearted but hard-headed, fat old man.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.008
He was a loner for the first half of his life.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.650
Punching bags, guns
and knives kept him company.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.366
A soldier with super fighting skills,

06:30.000 --> 06:33.800
Ding's proudest achievement wasn't his medals

06:34.600 --> 06:36.807
but his little granddaughter.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.800
During an outing,

06:42.240 --> 06:45.005
Ding lost his granddaughter.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.608
He searched everywhere,

06:47.600 --> 06:49.409
even put his life in danger

06:50.160 --> 06:52.288
but still failed to find her.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.284
Ding protected numerous VIPs in his life.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.809
But he failed to protect

07:01.800 --> 07:03.529
the one he wanted to most.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.845
Ding could never forgive himself

07:27.200 --> 07:29.601
for losing his granddaughter.

07:30.840 --> 07:34.640
His daughter was devastated and left him.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.641
After he retired,

07:38.120 --> 07:40.600
Ding left Beijing, the site of so much pain

07:40.880 --> 07:44.282
and moved back to his hometown, Suizhen.

08:02.600 --> 08:07.208
Like this little town
at the Chinese/Russian border,

08:08.400 --> 08:11.290
Ding is isolated and lonely.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.201
Counting the days

08:41.640 --> 08:43.244
- Ding!
'M0rning!

09:15.600 --> 09:17.762
Liver no good, cirrhosis

09:21.360 --> 09:22.327
Kidneys no good,

09:22.640 --> 09:23.448
remove one!

09:25.120 --> 09:28.044
Cut the intestines too, heart no good.

09:29.280 --> 09:32.090
Dr. Hu, can any of my organs be saved?

09:32.600 --> 09:33.840
Just kidding.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.601
Other than memory issues, you're fine.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.402
Okay.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.124
Your short-term memory will get worse.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.722
Here.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.651
An early symptom of dementia.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.208
Go home and write down your bank password.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.651
Don't worry too much.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.888
You're stable until you hit 65.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.761
Dr. Liu, I'm 66.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.768
My name is Hu.

10:11.920 --> 10:12.967
Since you're so forgetful,

10:13.040 --> 10:14.690
get yourself a recorder.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.450
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.286
I'm Dr. Hu.

10:19.680 --> 10:20.408
How can I help you?

10:20.560 --> 10:22.369
Do you sell tape recorders?

10:23.360 --> 10:24.964
No tape recorders anymore.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.887
But we have digital recorders.

10:28.680 --> 10:29.442
How does it work?

10:29.680 --> 10:31.409
Here's the record button.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.881
The stop button and the play button.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.201
As simple as that!

10:38.680 --> 10:41.331
Hello? How are you?

11:18.120 --> 11:19.201
Mr. Ding!

11:21.320 --> 11:22.845
Are you picking the lock again?

11:25.600 --> 11:26.681
The key is on you!

11:36.960 --> 11:37.961
Mr. Ding,

11:38.720 --> 11:39.960
did you have a checkup?

11:41.640 --> 11:42.448
Well

11:43.680 --> 11:44.727
What did the doctor say?

11:45.840 --> 11:46.807
Nothing.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.644
Like I said, there is nothing wrong with you.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.122
Well

11:51.920 --> 11:54.571
I think it's the pollution.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.808
The air quality here is
much better than in Beijing.

11:57.120 --> 11:57.803
Mhm.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.766
You moved here for six months ago, right?

12:00.880 --> 12:03.804
- Well
- Six months and five days.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.524
See how well I can remember details about you?

12:09.720 --> 12:10.403
Ah

12:11.760 --> 12:15.082
You keep saying well and ah.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.850
Have you forgotten my name?

12:17.920 --> 12:18.728
<i>Park Seen Nun</i>

12:18.760 --> 12:20.125
Ding's landlady.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.970
She looked like Angelababy when she was young.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.361
Now she looks like Auntie Angela.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.244
My name is Park, Park Seon Nun.

12:29.520 --> 12:31.249
And my nationality?

12:31.760 --> 12:33.000
Ah

12:33.800 --> 12:35.848
Korean, like Dae Jang Geum.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.366
Ah

12:41.560 --> 12:44.211
Miss Park, if there's nothing else,

12:44.720 --> 12:45.846
I must get back.

12:45.840 --> 12:46.921
Oh!

12:55.920 --> 12:58.321
The old man forgot my name.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.051
Why aren't you in school?

13:12.600 --> 13:14.443
Today is Sunday.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.284
I send you to school to study.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.248
Not to argue with me.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.045
You're just a gambling addict!

13:25.360 --> 13:27.567
Li Zheng Jiu, Ding's neighbour.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.045
A waste of oxygen,

13:29.120 --> 13:30.451
better off dead.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.090
He owes everyone money.

13:32.280 --> 13:36.046
Except for his hair, he's a complete loser.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.608
He tries to make things right
but just messes up more.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.809
His wife left him out of frustration.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.086
They say, fathers and daughters were
once lovers in past lives.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.651
He and his daughter

13:46.920 --> 13:48.410
are like enemies!

13:53.240 --> 13:55.163
Hey! Hey!

13:59.640 --> 14:00.971
Bad girl!

14:13.200 --> 14:14.122
Other than burglars,

14:14.440 --> 14:17.284
she's the only one who enters this way.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.200
Her name is Cherry.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.644
After fighting with her dad,

14:22.920 --> 14:25.366
she hides out at Old Ding's house.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.688
Ding is her meal ticket

14:30.720 --> 14:32.404
and her bodyguard.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.001
It hurts!

14:44.040 --> 14:44.962
Hey Ding!

14:45.240 --> 14:47.846
The landlady Ms. Park across the way

14:49.000 --> 14:51.446
has her eyes on you.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.041
What are you afraid of?

14:55.560 --> 14:58.689
Her laugh is scary but she has a good figure.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.051
I'll be your matchmaker?

15:02.840 --> 15:04.080
Cherry Li!

15:20.880 --> 15:22.644
Has my daughter come here again?

15:22.640 --> 15:23.641
Well

15:33.280 --> 15:35.726
Cherry Li get out here now!

15:36.160 --> 15:37.889
I don't have time for this.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.361
I have to go out.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.330
Go back home to keep watch.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.366
If you aren't home when
I get back, I'll kill you!

16:05.440 --> 16:10.287
I'm a headless ghost!

16:10.760 --> 16:11.602
Take it off!

16:11.640 --> 16:14.246
I like this jacket, lend it to me.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.327
Take it off!

16:16.040 --> 16:18.168
Fat men are supposed to be jolly.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.362
Take it off!

16:19.360 --> 16:20.725
Alright!

16:23.520 --> 16:24.681
No fun!

17:26.359 --> 17:27.327
Thanks.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.688
Wait, I win!

17:40.840 --> 17:42.046
Let me see.

17:42.840 --> 17:43.887
What?

17:44.520 --> 17:46.090
What's there to see?

17:46.120 --> 17:47.281
Can't I check?

17:48.040 --> 17:49.371
What if you cheated?

17:49.920 --> 17:51.922
- Who's cheating?
- We're playing for money here!

17:52.040 --> 17:52.882
So what?

17:52.960 --> 17:54.086
- What?
- Loser!

17:54.120 --> 17:55.610
Watch you mouth!

17:55.640 --> 17:56.527
Try me!

17:57.520 --> 17:59.329
Come on.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.404
It's just a game.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.685
Come here!

18:04.680 --> 18:05.841
Come here if you dare!

18:23.440 --> 18:24.965
How much does he owe us?

18:25.520 --> 18:26.851
250,000 yuan.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.404
250K!

18:33.880 --> 18:35.450
When can you pay UP?

18:39.080 --> 18:40.047
A few days.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.681
A few days?

18:54.040 --> 18:57.169
I know your kind.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.241
Let me ask you.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.923
Do you have a cousin

19:03.040 --> 19:05.122
who works as chef at the Red Star Hotel?

19:08.880 --> 19:11.008
I'll give you a chance?

19:11.720 --> 19:12.926
Big Red!

19:19.000 --> 19:20.126
A certain man

19:20.280 --> 19:22.601
will go to Vladivostok tonight.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.524
He's staying at the Red Star.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.131
He has a bag.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.049
I want you to bring it to me.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.924
Big Red will go with you.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.686
After it's done,

19:33.720 --> 19:36.564
we can discuss your debt.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.963
I want to remind you.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.925
You only get one chance.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.649
If you screw up,

19:49.240 --> 19:50.765
You'll be in big trouble.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.850
Room 505, to the right, end of the hall.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.810
He brought a leather bag?

20:39.240 --> 20:41.527
You work for Choi Dong Hen?

20:43.360 --> 20:44.327
You know him?

20:45.360 --> 20:47.522
He doesn't play by the rules.

23:55.800 --> 23:56.767
We've got a problem!

24:04.200 --> 24:06.851
Stop! Don't run!

24:10.520 --> 24:11.806
Stop him!

24:14.320 --> 24:15.321
Don't run!

24:16.520 --> 24:17.203
Lev!

24:17.240 --> 24:18.366
What's wrong, boss?

24:18.520 --> 24:19.601
Get the bag back!

24:21.360 --> 24:23.601
Catch him! Don't lose him!

24:30.240 --> 24:32.641
Don't run! Stop!

24:38.560 --> 24:39.971
Stop there!

24:41.360 --> 24:43.089
Stop him!

24:54.640 --> 24:56.369
You can't escape!

25:15.240 --> 25:16.241
<i>Let's gm!</i>

25:35.120 --> 25:36.406
Here's the bag.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.405
That should cancel my debt.

25:39.560 --> 25:40.322
No!

25:40.400 --> 25:41.970
Boss said you just get another week to pay up.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.081
No...

25:50.040 --> 25:51.007
What?

25:51.240 --> 25:52.844
You got the bag but left a messy trail.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.126
You're in big trouble.

25:57.560 --> 25:58.891
Eat shit!

26:43.160 --> 26:44.207
IQOr!

26:44.440 --> 26:45.885
What the hell happened?

26:45.880 --> 26:47.803
Who is this Choi Dong Hen?

26:48.440 --> 26:50.568
He not only stepped on my turf.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.643
He stole from me.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.004
I want justice.

26:59.920 --> 27:04.960
He killed a couple of my men.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.724
I swear

27:11.680 --> 27:14.524
anyone who goes against us

27:15.400 --> 27:16.970
will pay dearly

27:21.520 --> 27:22.567
just like him.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.680
The underworld has its rules.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.407
Choi Dong Hen is your man.

27:41.640 --> 27:44.246
If you want to continue to work with us,

27:44.600 --> 27:46.409
you know what to do.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.842
(Serves You Right)

28:32.520 --> 28:34.887
Ding, let's go fishing.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.004
Morning, Ding!

28:43.160 --> 28:44.889
- Morning.
- Morning.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.409
I want a henchman too.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.645
Keep dreaming.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.211
Buy ice-cream!

29:01.280 --> 29:02.566
The doctor banned it from my diet.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.964
Buy one for me.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.285
But you're not allowed.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.370
A tiny bite won't hurt.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.084
Ding, wait!

29:42.120 --> 29:43.281
Come on, fish!

29:52.120 --> 29:53.121
It's mine!

29:53.680 --> 29:56.286
How does that fool keep catching fish?

29:57.680 --> 29:58.966
You're the fool.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.401
I'll catch an even bigger fish!

30:05.520 --> 30:06.760
Serves you right.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.681
Ding,

30:08.880 --> 30:10.644
are you really moving out?

30:12.160 --> 30:13.047
Who told you?

30:13.280 --> 30:15.169
The old men at the station.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.765
Miss Park was heartbroken.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.125
Are you moving out soon?

30:18.760 --> 30:19.807
Maybe.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.168
Can't you take me in your suitcase?

30:24.040 --> 30:24.962
Why?

30:26.080 --> 30:28.686
If you leave, I have no one to go fishing with.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.361
What about your classmates?

30:31.200 --> 30:33.407
We don't get along.

30:34.200 --> 30:38.250
Except one girl named Bella Wu.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.046
Bella Wu?

30:40.960 --> 30:42.883
Miss Park wants to marry you.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.045
Do you want to marry her?

30:47.880 --> 30:48.722
No!

30:48.720 --> 30:50.006
Good!

30:50.880 --> 30:52.245
Pick me then!

30:52.520 --> 30:54.010
I can take care of you.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.651
You're so forgetful,

30:55.840 --> 30:57.808
you'll get lost on your own

30:57.960 --> 31:00.645
end up as a homeless bum

31:00.880 --> 31:03.645
fighting stray dogs over scraps.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.882
You should take me with you.

31:09.720 --> 31:10.721
What about your father?

31:11.880 --> 31:13.086
He can...

31:14.000 --> 31:15.047
marry Miss Park.

31:31.080 --> 31:32.411
- Mr. Ding!
- Umm.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.609
I prepared a few dishes.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.165
Join me for lunch?

31:37.280 --> 31:39.282
-L...
- You have to come!

31:43.360 --> 31:44.327
Thank you.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.407
Delicious?

31:54.720 --> 31:55.687
Mmm.

32:03.800 --> 32:04.847
After the meal,

32:05.920 --> 32:07.809
let's visit some lady friends of mine.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.247
Interested?

32:11.200 --> 32:12.531
I'm in no hurry.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.364
It's not about being in a hurry.

32:15.960 --> 32:18.008
It's about feelings.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.651
If you like each other,

32:20.760 --> 32:22.330
Don't waste time pining away.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.041
You're getting old.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.969
You need someone to take care of you.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.365
Look at how thin you are!

32:28.000 --> 32:30.241
I was a caregiver when I was younger.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.721
Mr. Ding

32:36.080 --> 32:36.808
Hmm.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.161
Have you eaten enough?

32:39.720 --> 32:40.846
Yes.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.443
Don't go yet.
The pig knuckles aren't done yet.

32:44.520 --> 32:45.885
Mom, what's so urgent?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.729
My son, Park Chan Seun.

32:48.760 --> 32:49.727
A police officer,

32:49.880 --> 32:51.370
just promoted to deputy captain.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.926
Mr. Ding used to be a civil servant too.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.724
A retiree from the Central Security Bureau.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.207
Have some tea!

33:03.800 --> 33:05.529
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, I have.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.091
Chat some more!

33:08.520 --> 33:09.282
Mr. Ding

33:09.840 --> 33:11.365
You came to identify suspect.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.726
We met then.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.162
Have we?

33:19.720 --> 33:21.404
Have some tea!

33:33.720 --> 33:35.529
My mother makes the best pig knuckles.

33:37.520 --> 33:38.851
- But I'm on a diet.
- Have more?

33:39.600 --> 33:41.284
No thanks, I have to go.

33:46.200 --> 33:48.328
What's the hurry, Ding?

33:50.880 --> 33:51.961
No pig knuckles?

33:52.240 --> 33:53.162
Well.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.887
I told you to chat him up.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.170
We have nothing in common.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.326
You're the one who likes him.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.928
I want you to learn more about him.

34:03.760 --> 34:06.730
I'm a man! Leave me out of
your love life, please?

34:06.760 --> 34:08.205
What do you mean?

34:08.360 --> 34:09.725
How often do I fall in love?

34:10.280 --> 34:11.725
I don't have time for this.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.210
I've got criminals to deal with.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.248
Boss!

34:33.040 --> 34:34.041
Something happened.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.243
Li took off with the bag.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.045
Damn it!

34:43.360 --> 34:44.646
Did your nephew return with a bag?

34:44.840 --> 34:46.967
No, he hasn't been here.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.570
Stop it.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.400
Don't call the police!

34:51.400 --> 34:52.764
Your nephew owes us money.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.401
Take him away.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.325
He has a daughter.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.081
Come outside!

35:22.120 --> 35:23.087
That Way!

35:51.840 --> 35:52.762
Open the door!

35:54.040 --> 35:55.121
Open up!

35:56.600 --> 35:57.647
Open the door!

36:01.200 --> 36:02.281
Open the door!

36:03.120 --> 36:04.246
I said open the door!

36:08.160 --> 36:09.082
Open the door!

36:16.960 --> 36:18.769
Old man. Where's her father?

36:22.840 --> 36:24.330
Hey, old man!

36:24.880 --> 36:26.006
Where are you going?

36:42.520 --> 36:43.442
Go away!

36:43.760 --> 36:44.727
Go away!

37:29.600 --> 37:32.570
Ding! Ding!

38:08.320 --> 38:10.084
What are you staring at? Go!

38:14.440 --> 38:16.602
Police? Let me speak to my son.

38:16.640 --> 38:17.641
No.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.361
I want to report a crime.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.002
Slowly.

38:35.560 --> 38:36.721
You should rest.

38:38.640 --> 38:39.721
How's the child?

38:40.400 --> 38:42.528
She's fine. She regained consciousness.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.607
How's your leg?

38:46.680 --> 38:47.681
I'm fine.

38:47.960 --> 38:48.882
How can you be?

38:48.920 --> 38:49.887
You've lost so much blood.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.410
Mom, stop talking.

38:51.680 --> 38:52.806
I'm working.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.609
Only policemen get to talk?

38:56.360 --> 38:57.168
Mr. Ding,

38:57.160 --> 38:59.845
can you remember what those men looked like?

39:02.520 --> 39:03.726
License plate number?

39:06.160 --> 39:07.161
Why bother asking?

39:07.200 --> 39:08.929
He has a poor memory.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.204
Mr. Ding,
we can't get in touch with

39:12.240 --> 39:13.685
Cherry's father, Li Zheng Jiu.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.684
We followed protocol and sent Cherry Li

39:15.720 --> 39:17.210
to stay with her great-uncle temporarily.

39:17.320 --> 39:20.085
We've verified the relationship.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.766
No need to worry about her safety.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.928
Right, Mom.
If you see Li Zheng Jiu,

39:26.000 --> 39:26.842
call me at once.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.325
Of course.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.642
Captain Park!

39:35.640 --> 39:37.768
The child identified the two men
in the photo as the attackers.

39:37.800 --> 39:38.722
It's them!

39:39.360 --> 39:40.930
They're known as Er Bao and Shortie.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.810
They're Choi Dong Hen's men.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.164
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.324
You two couldn't even

39:58.920 --> 40:00.081
deal with an old man.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.408
What do I keep you around for?

40:05.280 --> 40:08.363
Boss, that old man is like a Kung Fu Panda.

40:09.520 --> 40:10.646
Listen!

40:11.120 --> 40:12.531
Lay low in the countryside.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.682
Don't let the police find you!

40:17.560 --> 40:18.891
Get moving!

40:22.320 --> 40:23.810
That old man is no ordinary man.

41:11.520 --> 41:13.124
Morning, Ding.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.401
Morning.

41:16.400 --> 41:17.401
Eaten yet?

41:17.520 --> 41:18.442
Mm.

41:19.760 --> 41:23.242
Ding is a retired officer from Beijing.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.763
He can afford to eat out everyday, not like us.

41:26.840 --> 41:30.447
If we want to eat, our wives must cook for us.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.048
I don't even have a wife.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.725
Peace and quiet, even better.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.680
No need to be sarcastic.

41:38.240 --> 41:41.961
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

42:12.960 --> 42:15.247
Life suddenly grew quiet.

42:16.240 --> 42:19.210
Ding felt like something was missing.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.004
That's why he never shut that window.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.766
(City Wide Manhunt
and Two Arrest Warrants Issued)

42:39.760 --> 42:42.411
(For Suspects in Attempted Kidnapping Case)

42:46.160 --> 42:49.164
Mr. Ding! Mr. Ding!

42:49.640 --> 42:51.927
Your nephew is on the line.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.570
Uncle, why are you still at home?

42:54.880 --> 42:55.847
What's the matter?

42:56.160 --> 42:58.288
Today is my sister's wedding, did you forget?

42:58.360 --> 42:59.521
Everyone is waiting for you.

42:59.560 --> 43:02.086
I'll come over now.

43:02.920 --> 43:04.081
Hurry UP!

43:04.160 --> 43:05.650
Take the bus, okay?

43:06.240 --> 43:07.082
Okay.

43:15.280 --> 43:17.521
Uncle!

43:18.040 --> 43:18.962
Hello, Uncle!

43:19.680 --> 43:22.365
Don't you recognize Cheryl with make-up on?

43:23.880 --> 43:26.326
Her husband, Huang Da Xin.

43:26.360 --> 43:28.010
- Hello, Uncle!
- Hi.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.327
Uncle.

43:33.680 --> 43:34.841
Lucky money!

43:39.720 --> 43:41.245
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Uncle!

43:41.400 --> 43:42.447
Thank you, Uncle!

43:43.200 --> 43:44.122
Granduncle!

43:44.160 --> 43:46.766
Uncle, he's my sister-in-law's boy.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.126
Thank you, Granduncle!

43:54.800 --> 43:56.165
Granduncle!

44:00.280 --> 44:01.691
Thank you, Granduncle!

44:02.280 --> 44:03.008
Granduncle!

44:03.080 --> 44:05.082
I want one too, Granduncle!

44:06.040 --> 44:07.610
Granduncle!

44:36.800 --> 44:39.041
Sir, are you buying or not?

45:31.920 --> 45:33.365
It's beautiful!

45:33.880 --> 45:35.245
Look over there!

45:41.160 --> 45:42.810
Ding? That's Old Ding!

45:42.880 --> 45:44.803
Ding! Ding!

45:45.880 --> 45:46.927
Ding!

45:48.280 --> 45:50.044
Ding, this is Bella Wu.

45:50.080 --> 45:51.002
Hello.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.570
Why are you dressed like this?

45:54.600 --> 45:56.762
Our school is taking part in the parade.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.525
We just finished.

45:58.760 --> 45:59.727
How do we look?

46:02.680 --> 46:05.411
Do we look like giant moths?

46:21.560 --> 46:22.527
Ding

46:22.800 --> 46:25.804
Don't you think Bella looks like
a donkey when she smiles?

46:27.840 --> 46:28.602
Mhm.

46:29.640 --> 46:31.165
I'll tell Bella that.

46:35.800 --> 46:37.768
How's your great-uncle's house?

46:39.680 --> 46:41.330
Let's order this wedding cake.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.840
Your daughter is not
coming to the wedding, is she?

46:43.880 --> 46:45.450
I'm not inviting her.

46:45.560 --> 46:47.130
I don't think I could deal with her.

46:47.160 --> 46:48.286
I still don't get it.

46:48.440 --> 46:50.204
Why did you marry Li?

46:50.240 --> 46:51.321
Forget him.

46:51.360 --> 46:52.725
Don't insult my father!

46:52.800 --> 46:55.371
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

46:55.760 --> 46:56.921
Are you done?

46:56.960 --> 46:58.564
- I won't let you!
- Cut it out!

46:58.600 --> 46:59.761
Behave yourself!

47:05.960 --> 47:06.927
You okay?

47:19.000 --> 47:22.163
Crazy girl! Just like your father.

47:54.440 --> 47:57.171
Was that woman your mother?

49:05.240 --> 49:06.969
We've already looked after her for two weeks.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.729
We can do no more.

49:09.160 --> 49:12.528
We just can't contact her father.

49:12.720 --> 49:14.370
You won't take care of her forever.

49:14.720 --> 49:17.246
No, we've had enough.

49:17.440 --> 49:19.886
We can't deal with her.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.929
But you're her relatives.

49:22.120 --> 49:23.849
No!

49:23.960 --> 49:26.566
We cut our ties a long time ago.

49:26.960 --> 49:29.406
What are we going to do with her?

49:37.520 --> 49:39.124
Ding can take me in.

49:50.320 --> 49:51.731
Two weeks is a long time.

49:51.760 --> 49:53.000
Ate any ice-cream while I was gone?

49:55.600 --> 49:56.681
What do you think?

50:02.760 --> 50:03.886
Morning, Ding.

50:04.040 --> 50:05.280
- Morning.
- Morning.

50:05.320 --> 50:06.207
Leg still hurts?

50:06.400 --> 50:07.322
Much better.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.923
Ever get stabbed in the leg?

50:10.200 --> 50:11.361
Never.

50:53.160 --> 50:55.527
Eat at my place from now on!

50:58.080 --> 50:59.764
You're too kind, I can't impose.

51:01.560 --> 51:02.527
Not talking to you.

51:04.760 --> 51:06.125
How can I impose?

51:07.360 --> 51:08.930
It's nothing.

51:09.720 --> 51:12.610
If it makes you feel better,
you can buy the groceries.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.210
It's better than eating alone.

51:14.680 --> 51:16.523
Saves money too, don't you think?

51:24.680 --> 51:27.160
Can I make a phone call, Miss Park?

51:27.360 --> 51:30.648
Fine. No long-distance.

51:30.960 --> 51:32.405
Of course.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.924
What are you doing?

51:54.200 --> 51:56.407
I'll go get it for you now.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.286
Thanks.

52:07.760 --> 52:09.842
I'm going home, Ding.

52:53.760 --> 52:54.886
Thank you.

53:01.960 --> 53:03.041
Thanks for saving my child.

53:04.120 --> 53:05.201
I'm grateful.

53:06.440 --> 53:07.601
You should go to the police.

53:07.640 --> 53:08.801
I can't.

53:09.400 --> 53:10.606
Then why are you here?

53:12.040 --> 53:13.246
I have to skip town.

53:15.240 --> 53:16.685
Please take care of my child.

53:17.560 --> 53:18.846
I'll come for her later.

53:19.760 --> 53:21.205
It's not safe to take her with me.

53:21.920 --> 53:23.763
Tell her yourself.

53:27.240 --> 53:28.969
I don't know how to talk to her.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.803
I try to make things right

53:37.880 --> 53:39.405
but I just make things worse.

53:47.680 --> 53:49.045
Please take care of my child.

53:49.400 --> 53:50.561
I'll send you more.

53:50.800 --> 53:51.722
No need.

53:58.080 --> 53:59.411
I promise to come back.

55:14.320 --> 55:16.049
Stop there!

55:16.080 --> 55:16.888
Don't run!

55:19.040 --> 55:20.041
Where are you running?

55:20.040 --> 55:21.041
Run again?

55:59.040 --> 56:00.007
Boss!

56:39.360 --> 56:41.124
Spare my daughter.

56:43.960 --> 56:46.247
Spare my daughter.

56:51.080 --> 56:54.084
I'll make sure to bury her.

57:53.200 --> 57:55.362
They're murderers and arsonists!

57:56.520 --> 57:58.648
They should be caught and executed on the spot.

57:58.760 --> 58:00.649
Calm down first.

58:00.760 --> 58:01.727
We must operate within the law.

58:01.800 --> 58:02.847
Calm down?

58:03.280 --> 58:04.884
I lost two houses!

58:04.960 --> 58:06.246
I know.

58:06.400 --> 58:08.721
Find someplace to sit. I have work to do.

58:41.800 --> 58:43.006
Uncle Hua!

58:44.240 --> 58:46.004
He)', Nephew!

58:46.040 --> 58:47.451
Let's have a toast.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.209
- Girls, get out.
- Drink up!

58:55.080 --> 58:57.162
Uncle Hua's wine is always the best.

58:59.880 --> 59:02.963
Someone stole a bag of jewelery
from the Russians,

59:03.080 --> 59:04.127
it's worth tens of millions.

59:04.320 --> 59:06.448
- Do you know who did it?
- I don't know.

59:08.160 --> 59:09.127
Be careful!

59:09.320 --> 59:10.651
I don't want trouble.

59:10.920 --> 59:14.641
Don't worry! There won't be any trouble.

59:14.920 --> 59:16.763
Good to know.

59:18.040 --> 59:19.644
- Come!
- Cheers!

59:29.400 --> 59:32.529
He won't get away. We'll nail him.

59:36.360 --> 59:38.124
Any news about the child?

59:53.600 --> 59:54.761
Uncle Hua is here.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.442
Boss!

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.522
Heard you guys had a run in with my nephew.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.008
I have something to discuss with you.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.086
When you arrive,

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.044
come meet us.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.644
(Attention All Porters!)

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.645
(The K7024 Train has arrived at the station.)

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.887
(Porters please standby.)

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.809
(Attention All Porters!)

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.644
(The K7024 Train has arrived at the station.)

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.529
(Porters please standby.)

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.848
(Murder Suspect Released Due
to Lack of Evidence)

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.249
Mr. Ding, what is it?

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.171
I want to make a phone call.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.041
Go ahead.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.321
Long-distance.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.166
No problem.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:15.762
I'm in a meeting. Please leave
your message. Thank you.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.646
Ya Nan.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.211
It's me, your father.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.045
I know that

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.884
no matter what I do,

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.000
no matter what I do,

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.205
I can't make up for my failures.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.283
I would only make it worse.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.929
I've waited a long time to say this.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.885
I'm sorry.

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.806
I'm so sorry.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.331
How could you fail to watch over a child?

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.607
You old fool!

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:15.685
Give me back my daughter!

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.609
I have something to tell you.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.601
Yes?

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.406
I joined the army in 1964.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.645
I took the train there.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.561
In 1966

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.362
at the Lanzhou Army Combat Tournament,

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.321
I won the first place.

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.690
I was later assigned to the
Central Security Bureau in Beijing.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.444
I was married in 1971.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.324
My wife Lv Ping

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.004
was a dancer.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.411
Her father was a bourgeois capitalist.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.810
She married me

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.044
to prevent her family

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.084
from being persecuted.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.763
She never loved me.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.926
We have a daughter, Ya Nan.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.561
She and I were on good terms.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.726
But

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.048
her daughter, my granddaughter...

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.971
she went missing on my watch.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.162
Ya Nan refused to see me again.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.405
That's my life.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.330
That's all I can remember.

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.960
Other than that,

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.244
I can't even remember what I ate last night.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.371
Do people like me

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.644
deserve to be treated nicely?

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.367
Boss!

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.124
Turn on the light!

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.449
Where's the girl?

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.081
What girl?

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.845
Cherry Li, my neighbor's child.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.250
How would I know?

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.571
Did you kill her?

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.721
Old man!

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.405
Be gone

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:41.370
by the time I count to three.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.089
If I see you again, I'll kill you.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.804
You want to die?

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:26.323
Kill him! Kill him for me!

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.607
Jin!

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.767
Boss!

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.810
What are you doing with the money?

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.807
Put it in the bag!

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.004
- Boss!
- Get off me, losers!

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.809
Get up! Get up!

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.443
Kill him! Kill him!

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.364
What's going on?

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:23.841
Kill them!

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.841
Cherry

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.526
Where's Cherry?

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.690
DOfft

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:49.847
It's done!

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:55.121
Move in.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:58.961
This way.

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:35.846
- Drive off!
- Your bag.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.801
All units!

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.088
Black escape vehicle spotted
near the train station.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.163
License plate C76171

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.644
I repeat, black car, license C76171

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.571
Captain Park, location please!

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:09.966
Turning onto Xing Hua Street.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.810
Urgent! Where's the backup?

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.325
In position.

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.202
Captain Park

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:18.283
Intersection of Xin Hua Street
and Huang He Road blocked by Units 3 & <i>7</i>

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.002
Intercept them at the crossroad ahead!

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.687
Smash through!

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.084
Surround them. Don't let them escape!

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.281
Don't move!

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.290
Where's Cherry?

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:17.961
Old man!

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.250
Come on! Come get me!

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.850
Listen!

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.684
This is my turf.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:29.320
I can kill whoever I want.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:31.444
I killed your neighbor, Li.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.689
I'll kill his daughter too.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.370
Try to stop me?

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.164
I'll kill you too.

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.371
Just wait and see!

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.051
Good to see you here!

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:33.967
Boss!

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:38.171
Kung Fu Panda is chasing me.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.321
You two

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.721
kill him for me.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.126
- Okay!
- Hurry.

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.885
You're not allowed.

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.090
A little bite won't hurt.

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.130
The landlady across the way
has her eyes on you.

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.363
No need to be shy.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.649
Are we going fishing today?

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:38.450
If you leave, I'll have no one
to go fishing with.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:47.081
Can't you take me in your suitcase?

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:50.603
Please look after my daughter!

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:35.682
Mr. Ding!

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.523
Why are you sitting here alone?

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.570
Why are you crying?

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.164
Ding, what's wrong?

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.290
I lost my granddaughter.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.206
What are you talking about?

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.608
She went missing a long time ago.

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.602
There's nothing you can do about it.

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.289
Look at you.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.765
Let me help you.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:15.202
Ding fought the gangsters in self-defense

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:19.726
and was instrumental in bringing down
Chinese and Russian gangs.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.321
The police didn't pursue
criminal liability against Ding.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.691
But after that day, his memory got worse.

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:32.723
He became obsessed with Cherry's disappearance.

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.044
He ended up at the police station in a daze.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:48.801
Hey Mister!

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:50.841
You again?

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.046
Take a seat first.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.204
You want me to listen to this?

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.201
Mister, that's strange. There is nothing on it.

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.081
Perhaps you pressed the Erase button instead?

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.285
Just tell me what happened.

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.164
Tell me what you recorded.

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:39.961
I forgot.

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.047
In that case,

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.846
come back when you remember,
I'll treat you tea.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.121
I have a meeting.

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:50.370
Get home safely.

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.965
Where have you been?

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.724
At Bella Wu's house.

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.929
I called her from your home.

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.123
Who's Bella Wu? A gangster?

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.840
No! She's my classmate.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.684
You scared us to death.

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:22.966
What's wrong?

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:25.242
You should tell us when you go out.

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:30.247
Come with me!

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:35.600
Miss Park.

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:39.201
Overdue rent is no reason
to burn down our house.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.929
Has my dad returned?

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:44.162
Your father...

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:46.004
went to Beijing for work.

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.645
He wanted you to be a good girl.

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.522
Alright.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.570
Where are you going?

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.201
Even though Ding's recorder was blank,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.731
I could hear his love for me

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:19.120
I later learnt that

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.168
my father never went to Beijing.

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:23.889
He was killed,

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:25.570
trying to protect me.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.525
I lost a father

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.210
but gained a grandfather.

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:39.971
I've been taking care of Ding ever since.

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:48.285
He's forgotten all about fishing...

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.725
about ice-cream...

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.366
about those three old men...

01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:59.009
and even Miss Park's scary laugh.

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.006
Fortunately,

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.283
he still remembers me.

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.970
I'm Cherry Li.

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:21.566
He is my

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:24.201
beloved bodyguard grandfather.

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.689
Stop! What are you doing?

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:10.806
Stop!

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.850
My arm! It's hurts!

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:23.644
Why did you run, idiot?

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.326
Get lost!

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:41.242
Get lost!

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.971
Why do you always end up fighting?

01:32:44.305 --> 01:32:50.789
