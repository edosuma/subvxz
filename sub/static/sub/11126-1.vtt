02:09.264 --> 02:11.824
Roddy! School.

02:16.944 --> 02:17.775
Morning.

03:00.742 --> 03:01.692
Get that would you?

03:02.982 --> 03:06.132
If you're not giving me a lift
I'll have to get another minicab.

03:09.261 --> 03:10.217
Tristesse Books.

03:12.261 --> 03:17.256
I've got 'Wuthering Heights'
with my Year Tens. Hello. Yes?

03:17.701 --> 03:20.660
Tristesse Books? Tom Duval?

03:21.221 --> 03:23.736
Oh, yes, come in. Just down the hall..

03:52.940 --> 03:58.939
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah,

04:00.819 --> 04:06.736
he's a wonderful writer.
Very unremittingly bleak. No,

04:06.779 --> 04:08.896
Tristesse doesn't publish him any more.

04:08.939 --> 04:11.739
Do you know what? He had a
little disagreement with Tom..

04:16.298 --> 04:18.733
Yeah, she's one of
my favourites. Yeah.

04:19.658 --> 04:23.811
Yea, she was long-listed for the Booker,
you know? Right after she was sectioned.

04:30.458 --> 04:33.576
No. She... she left too. Jane Lockhart.

04:37.338 --> 04:38.288
What are you doing?

04:41.937 --> 04:44.336
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...

04:44.337 --> 04:46.010
I was just touching it.

04:47.617 --> 04:51.816
Not like 'touching' it, that's like
molesting. Like I'm some kind of pervert.

04:54.857 --> 04:55.847
Which I'm not.

04:57.257 --> 05:02.332
So, Young European Publisher of the
Year, Runner Up? That's really impressive.

05:03.656 --> 05:05.156
I have a swimming certificate.

05:08.336 --> 05:09.406
Who the hell are you?

05:10.336 --> 05:11.133
Jane Lockhart.

05:12.976 --> 05:15.126
I wrote 'The Endless Anguish of My Father'.

05:16.256 --> 05:19.613
Ah. Yes.

05:20.696 --> 05:21.493
Follow me.

05:28.215 --> 05:31.094
I'm busy, so I'll keep this
brief. I read your novel.

05:31.095 --> 05:33.246
I'm afraid it needs work. A lot of work.

05:33.895 --> 05:35.045
Please. Sit down.

05:35.895 --> 05:38.694
But it has potential,
so I'm going to publish it.

05:40.375 --> 05:43.734
I'm offering you a two-book deal.
It's going mean a lot of rewriting...

05:43.735 --> 05:46.694
...definitely a new title
- and neither of us will get rich...

05:46.695 --> 05:50.013
...but I think you have it in you
to be a writer and, unfashionable...

05:50.014 --> 05:53.514
...as it may seem, that's what I
came here to find. I believe you are..

05:59.134 --> 05:59.965
...crying.

06:00.054 --> 06:00.851
Sorry.

06:02.054 --> 06:04.444
I didn't mean to start...

06:05.214 --> 06:11.214
It's just, it's been so long. So
many rejections and I have a board...

06:11.454 --> 06:12.250
You have a board?

06:12.293 --> 06:15.650
Of rejection letters.
I call it my Board of Pain.

06:16.893 --> 06:18.393
Well that's completely normal.

06:18.773 --> 06:19.650
It is?

06:20.013 --> 06:23.412
I'm sorry. He was like this at university.
Everywhere he went crying women.

06:23.413 --> 06:26.133
You lot are supposed to be
charming. Charmant, n'est-ce pas?

06:26.173 --> 06:30.273
- I told you, never speak in French to me.
- Don't you dare. - No, no, no really...

06:31.053 --> 06:36.446
I've never been so happy in all my life.

07:10.931 --> 07:14.083
Jane. There is no need to be nervous.

07:14.531 --> 07:20.531
Nervous? Me? No. No. No. I'm not nervous.
Not me. Okay, a little bit nervous.

07:22.570 --> 07:23.447
You'll be fine.

07:24.290 --> 07:27.689
Sorry it's just usually I need
a run-up before I start editing.

07:27.690 --> 07:29.807
Like tea. A walk. Regret in the shower.

07:30.090 --> 07:31.240
Or we could just begin.

07:33.290 --> 07:36.567
Okay. Okay, yes.
So where do you want to begin?

07:36.770 --> 07:39.570
Well, call me crazy,
but we could start at the beginning.

07:40.090 --> 07:44.527
Yeah. Okay, yeah. Crazy Frenchman.

07:44.689 --> 07:45.520
What?

07:47.089 --> 07:48.125
I don't know. Great.

07:49.609 --> 07:50.440
So you're in a good mood.

07:50.649 --> 07:51.844
I'm always in a good mood.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.039
- No you're not.
- Yes I am.

07:53.089 --> 07:54.489
- Are you?
- Yes.

07:54.609 --> 07:55.440
Oh.

09:33.525 --> 09:36.165
Well, actually I'm
reading it right now...

09:37.525 --> 09:41.625
"I shut my eyes and sank into the water
letting it caress over my face and hair..."

09:43.844 --> 09:45.883
I was just, you know, passing,
and thought it might...

09:45.884 --> 09:48.784
...have come back from the
printer's and it actually has...

09:54.964 --> 09:57.718
"Beneath my feet I felt crumbled pages.."

10:01.084 --> 10:02.134
I don't believe this.

10:02.803 --> 10:03.753
I'll call you back.

10:04.123 --> 10:06.002
'Happy Ending'? 'Happy Ending'!?

10:06.003 --> 10:09.122
What happened to 'The
Endless Anguish of My Father'?

10:09.123 --> 10:14.039
What happened? You know how important this
stuff is. You changed my title! To that?

10:14.203 --> 10:17.594
I told you. The very first
time we met. I said it must go.

10:17.643 --> 10:18.997
Yes but we never discussed it.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.683
I knew how you'd react, darling.

10:22.843 --> 10:25.835
Oi, careful. That's my
Young Publisher of the Year award.

10:26.442 --> 10:27.273
Runner-up!

10:31.002 --> 10:32.118
What's wrong with you?

10:32.882 --> 10:33.713
Who are you?

10:34.562 --> 10:35.439
What?

10:35.522 --> 10:38.372
All that time we spent
together working on the manuscript.

10:40.082 --> 10:42.551
No-one's ever got me the way you...

10:51.281 --> 10:52.158
I don't know you.

10:57.081 --> 11:01.280
Look, it was a terrible
title and I changed it.

11:01.281 --> 11:04.399
What's done is done. Let's move on.

11:05.121 --> 11:06.396
How can it be so easy for you?

11:06.521 --> 11:10.200
Perhaps because I am not a
moderately talented writer whose...

11:10.201 --> 11:14.558
...loser dad left her with an inability
to stop worshipping her own pain.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.989
Come, sit down. Let's
talk about the launch.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.477
You know what?

11:21.880 --> 11:24.630
Our deal is one more book.
And then what's done is done.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.150
Let's move on.

11:43.759 --> 11:46.513
'Most childhood summers
are long and blue.

11:47.879 --> 11:51.479
Mine wasn't like that. And certainly
not the summer when mam got sick...'

12:06.478 --> 12:08.757
She'd taken me to Woolworths
to choose my birthday present...

12:08.758 --> 12:11.077
...and it wouldn't be like last
year when dad just slipped the...

12:11.078 --> 12:14.478
...Barbie under his coat and walked
right out of the door with it...'

12:25.797 --> 12:27.097
Thank you for coming down.

12:27.757 --> 12:29.749
One more. There you are.

12:33.077 --> 12:35.273
And this is to...?

13:16.555 --> 13:21.194
It's great to be here to
present this award for...

13:21.195 --> 13:27.195
...Best New Writer to an outstanding
debut. 'Happy Ending'. Jane Lockhart.

13:40.754 --> 13:41.710
Congratulations.

13:41.914 --> 13:42.791
Thank you.

13:45.514 --> 13:49.303
What we have here, is a real writer.

13:50.314 --> 13:55.104
Someone who can go to some pretty
dark places. But I get it, Jane.

13:55.153 --> 13:59.952
Writers. We both understand what
it is to face El Toro Blanco...

13:59.953 --> 14:03.912
...the terror of the
white bull, the blank page.

14:03.913 --> 14:07.873
And every day we face
it. Together. Right, Jane?

14:09.673 --> 14:12.711
Ladies and Gentlemen, Jane Lockhart.

14:22.792 --> 14:23.589
Thank you.

15:36.069 --> 15:36.866
Yeah?

15:37.109 --> 15:38.228
I'm starting the final chapter.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.061
You'll have the manuscript
by the end of the week.

15:40.349 --> 15:41.465
About bloody time.

15:41.509 --> 15:43.868
Ah Tom, as ever my
little ray of sunshine.

15:43.869 --> 15:46.464
Well, moan all you like,
I've never been this-

15:47.029 --> 15:47.860
Annoying?

15:48.069 --> 15:51.266
Happy. You bastard. Happy.

15:51.308 --> 15:54.460
So, one more chapter...

15:54.668 --> 15:57.168
- Yes.
- And we never have to see each other again.

15:58.108 --> 15:58.939
Yes.

15:59.188 --> 16:02.864
Better get writing then. A bientot, Jane.

16:03.188 --> 16:04.258
Au revoir, Tom.

17:07.224 --> 17:09.376
Willie. I'm off out for a bit.

17:09.785 --> 17:10.582
Sure.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.098
Just look at the chapter..

17:20.425 --> 17:22.782
Listen, I don't care what you think.

17:22.784 --> 17:27.222
I'm telling you, this is not an
opening chapter. It's an Ice Age.

17:29.264 --> 17:31.183
You can't talk to me like that.

17:31.184 --> 17:35.781
I was voted one of Scotland's foremost
novelists under the age of thirty.

17:40.904 --> 17:44.342
And that's why I won't
allow this piece of crap...

17:44.343 --> 17:47.142
...to be published with your name on it.

17:49.143 --> 17:50.782
You have my notes. Fix it.

17:56.823 --> 17:58.773
Bye then Nicola. See you at the launch.

18:00.823 --> 18:04.897
If you try to make me cry,
I'll inform Inland Revenue about your yacht.

18:21.102 --> 18:21.899
Hi.

18:22.782 --> 18:23.659
Hi.

18:33.301 --> 18:37.001
If we have to talk figures, can you do
that thing where you use vegetables?

18:37.101 --> 18:38.694
Imagine this tomato is my cashflow.

18:38.741 --> 18:40.733
How many new writers have you
thrown money at this year?

18:41.181 --> 18:45.778
I only throw money at good writers.
Good Scottish writers. I'm very patriotic.

18:46.021 --> 18:47.221
And what does it matter?

18:47.621 --> 18:50.971
One hit pays for all the rest. And
I have a bestseller in the wings.

18:50.981 --> 18:53.859
Jane Lockhart. Yes.
So how's the new book shaping up?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.254
I have no idea.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.180
She won't let me read a
word until it's finished.

18:59.420 --> 19:02.094
Relax. It'll be just like the first one.

19:02.780 --> 19:04.630
I read that she was moving publisher.

19:05.340 --> 19:07.536
Klinsch & McLeish - with the
red and white covers? That's big time.

19:07.580 --> 19:11.019
Klinsch & McLeish. You know
what they're called in the trade?

19:11.020 --> 19:13.899
Clench and Release. They're
not right for my Jane.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.499
- For Jane.
- So talk to her. Persuade her to stay.

19:18.539 --> 19:20.258
But I don't want her to stay.

19:21.339 --> 19:23.979
After she delivers her new
novel, I want her to go. Far away.

19:24.019 --> 19:28.172
Oh for God's sake, Tom, Tristesse Books
is on the verge of compulsory liquidation.

19:29.579 --> 19:31.616
And, I've had an offer.

19:31.859 --> 19:33.259
Well you're a very attractive...

19:33.299 --> 19:34.096
Shut up.

19:36.139 --> 19:37.489
They want to invest in you.

19:42.018 --> 19:43.617
I don't need Pandemic Media.

19:43.618 --> 19:47.134
I have Jane Lockhart and this
time she's going all the way.

19:47.178 --> 19:50.057
Are you sure? Because
if she doesn't deliver...

19:51.058 --> 19:52.808
...your tomatoes look like ketchup.

19:53.298 --> 19:56.297
She'll deliver. She may be a
miserable pain in the arse...

19:56.298 --> 19:59.177
...but when she's writing,
she's like a guided missile.

20:08.537 --> 20:09.368
Tea-spoon?

20:16.897 --> 20:19.207
Willie? Willie, will you get that?

20:21.217 --> 20:22.014
Willie.

20:33.976 --> 20:34.807
Hello?

20:34.856 --> 20:36.756
Thursday or Friday for the manuscript?

20:37.376 --> 20:38.571
Grease-proof paper.

20:43.336 --> 20:44.215
I just want to check.

20:44.216 --> 20:46.416
You're certain it will
be finished next week?

20:46.656 --> 20:48.206
I told you, one more chapter...

20:49.255 --> 20:50.205
What are you doing?

20:52.175 --> 20:53.006
Nothing.

20:53.095 --> 20:53.892
Are you baking?

21:10.335 --> 21:16.334
Oh my God, she's baking.
She only bakes when she's blocked.

21:21.654 --> 21:23.486
Largest planet in the solar system?

21:23.974 --> 21:24.851
Jupiter.

21:25.094 --> 21:26.453
Who did Ali beat to become...

21:26.454 --> 21:28.854
...World Heavyweight
Champion for the first time?

21:29.334 --> 21:33.248
Sonny Liston. Come on, the quiz is gonna
be harder than this. Get serious.

21:34.094 --> 21:36.289
Who was Shakespeare's wife?

21:38.773 --> 21:39.650
Hi dad.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.209
Darling.

21:44.693 --> 21:46.043
Who was Shakespeare's wife?

21:46.493 --> 21:47.529
Anne Hathaway.

21:47.773 --> 21:51.212
And at the end of the third round,
the leaders are Benny Lockhart...

21:51.213 --> 21:55.366
...and his Jets with twenty-two points.
Join us for the second half in ten minutes.

22:01.012 --> 22:01.809
Monsieur L.

22:01.892 --> 22:02.723
Ah Tom.

22:04.332 --> 22:05.322
Good to see you again.

22:05.372 --> 22:06.522
- Good to see you.
- How are you?

22:06.572 --> 22:07.801
Aye, good. Where you been hiding?

22:08.012 --> 22:09.207
From your daughter mostly.

22:09.252 --> 22:12.011
Oh I understand that. Never
talked to me for years...

22:12.012 --> 22:14.368
...but for good reason.
Hey, what you having?

22:14.412 --> 22:16.449
Nothing. He's not staying.

22:17.052 --> 22:17.929
Come on Jane.

22:19.052 --> 22:20.168
What are you doing here?

22:20.252 --> 22:22.330
My favourite author is being adapted...

22:22.331 --> 22:25.449
...by Scotland's most talented
screenwriter. Will Scott.

22:26.411 --> 22:29.609
Huge fan. Naturally I want
to know how he's getting on.

22:30.691 --> 22:33.610
Well, I mean I may not be
the most talented but...

22:33.611 --> 22:35.603
...who else are you going to pick?

22:41.611 --> 22:42.511
Where is my novel?

22:42.531 --> 22:43.410
I'm working on it.

22:43.411 --> 22:45.481
So you're not suffering
from El Torro Blanco?

22:45.610 --> 22:46.487
The what?

22:46.570 --> 22:48.527
- So you're not b-I-o-c-k-e-d?
- Why are you spelling it?

22:48.570 --> 22:51.802
It's nothing to be ashamed of and there
are plenty of strategies to overcome it.

22:51.850 --> 22:52.650
I'm not blocked.

22:52.730 --> 22:54.608
- For instance, stimulants and narcotics.
- I'm not blocked.

22:54.650 --> 22:57.085
For a while there, Hunter
S Thompson was permanently unblocked.

22:57.130 --> 22:57.961
I'm not blocked.

22:58.010 --> 23:01.809
Until you deliver that manuscript
you're still under contract to me.

23:01.810 --> 23:05.804
So, whatever's going on, snap out
of it and get writing. 'Bye, Jane.

23:08.369 --> 23:09.166
'Bye Jane.

23:10.009 --> 23:11.409
Oh, he's not gone, has he?

23:12.929 --> 23:14.283
We never got the chance to
talk about my screenplay.

23:15.289 --> 23:16.086
Hi.

23:16.169 --> 23:21.244
The French really appreciate my work,
you know. Connoisseurs de Cinema. Oh aye.

23:21.929 --> 23:25.001
We should have him
over for dinner. Your wine.

23:25.449 --> 23:26.326
Bathroom.

23:33.008 --> 23:36.399
I know you, don't I? Where was it we met?

23:38.048 --> 23:40.207
Chapter Two. I'm in the
opening chapter of course...

23:40.208 --> 23:43.458
...but I'd say you only really
get to know me from Chapter Two on.

23:47.728 --> 23:48.605
Darsie?

23:50.848 --> 23:51.748
What do you think?

23:51.768 --> 23:53.088
I think I'm talking to my protagonist.

23:53.128 --> 23:54.004
I prefer heroine.

23:55.367 --> 23:56.567
What are you doing here?

23:57.567 --> 23:59.206
It's a very intense narrative.

23:59.207 --> 24:03.520
I personally have suffered a broken
engagement and two bereavements, so far.

24:03.567 --> 24:04.967
Yes, I know. Sorry.

24:05.127 --> 24:06.726
Oh no, please don't apologise.

24:06.727 --> 24:09.959
I think it's going to make me
a stronger person in the end.

24:10.367 --> 24:14.566
The end? Yes, so you're
going to go back and finish it?

24:16.686 --> 24:19.805
I can't do that, not without you.

24:19.806 --> 24:25.120
Why can't you finish it,
Jane? What are you afraid of?

24:43.445 --> 24:45.095
Get a hold of yourself, will you.

24:47.085 --> 24:49.805
Gets me every time. Three times now.

24:52.445 --> 24:53.515
It's that ending...

24:54.125 --> 24:56.725
Don't talk to me about damn
endings. Do your marking.

24:56.845 --> 24:59.405
Okay. It's silly.

25:03.084 --> 25:04.404
Oh, Jane says hi.

25:07.484 --> 25:08.520
That poor lassie.

25:10.324 --> 25:12.316
She must have lead such a
shocking life to write like that.

25:12.564 --> 25:13.564
What are you saying?

25:13.764 --> 25:19.203
Ah well, the lonely page,
the endless introspection...

25:19.284 --> 25:22.523
...the mind plagued by funky thoughts.

25:22.524 --> 25:27.279
It's how writers tick, isn't
it? No misery, no poetry.

25:39.323 --> 25:40.200
Yeah?

25:40.243 --> 25:41.359
Did you speak to Jane Lockhart?

25:41.563 --> 25:45.796
Yes, she's happy. Very happy. Happier
than she's ever been, apparently.

25:46.603 --> 25:47.514
And the novel?

25:52.482 --> 25:55.316
Tom? Hello? You still there?

25:58.922 --> 25:59.753
Tom?

26:08.402 --> 26:12.032
I have a problem I believe may
be suited to your particular talents.

26:12.561 --> 26:14.757
Let's say...

26:16.161 --> 26:17.361
...a miserable writer...

26:17.841 --> 26:21.720
...through the supreme efforts of her
publisher and her own meagre talent...

26:21.721 --> 26:24.316
...becomes successful and
happy. Are you listening?

26:25.041 --> 26:25.872
Hello, sir.

26:26.361 --> 26:27.795
Amber. Roxanne.

26:27.841 --> 26:29.355
Out on a school night, sir?

26:29.761 --> 26:31.011
This your boyfriend, sir?

26:34.561 --> 26:37.120
Say nothing, just keep very still.
You don't want to antagonise them.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.660
Can we get back to my problem?

26:38.680 --> 26:42.469
Okay. Yeah, miserable writer becomes
successful and happy. I get it. And?

26:43.200 --> 26:47.638
And being happy she is unable to
finish her latest miserable novel.

26:48.560 --> 26:52.639
So, in order to help her, the selfless
publisher embarks on a course of action...

26:52.640 --> 26:54.919
...to return her to the
fragile mental state...

26:54.920 --> 26:57.370
...in which she wrote her
highly profitable debut.

26:59.039 --> 27:03.039
You want to make Jane Lockhart's life a
misery so she'll finish writing her book?

27:03.399 --> 27:06.039
That is seriously messed up. Do
they teach you this stuff in France?

27:06.079 --> 27:07.479
We study a broad curriculum.

27:07.799 --> 27:11.679
So, how do we make someone
completely totally miserable?

27:12.559 --> 27:13.834
Why are you asking me?

27:14.839 --> 27:17.638
I've dedicated the last ten years
to encouraging young minds...

27:17.639 --> 27:19.238
...planting hope and aspiration...

27:19.239 --> 27:22.839
Benson, put it away! Stand in the
corner! Face to the wall! Little shite.

27:25.718 --> 27:28.168
Okay, maybe I have some
experience in the field...

27:28.598 --> 27:33.070
The trick is not simply to upset her.
You have to get her in the right mood.

27:33.358 --> 27:36.477
It's a special kind of
misery you want. Melancholy.

27:36.478 --> 27:40.397
That dull sense of dissociation
and alienation that's the source...

27:40.398 --> 27:44.676
...of every artist's creativity. It's
like drain unblocker for novelists.

27:46.957 --> 27:51.356
Keats. John Keats. You're
plan involves actually poetry?

27:51.357 --> 27:55.112
I think by definition
that makes it a shit plan.

27:59.597 --> 28:05.070
Alright, settle down you lot,
settle down. William Wordsworth.

28:06.717 --> 28:11.836
Wordsworth was, of course, the first
of the Romantics to use a MacBook Pro...

28:43.275 --> 28:45.392
Careful. You're going to kill that thing.

28:55.594 --> 28:57.944
You know, it was a birthday
present from my dad.

28:59.914 --> 29:01.633
He showed up out of the
blue with a card and...

29:01.874 --> 29:06.505
...a baby money plant and
he said, "I owe you darlin'.

29:07.794 --> 29:09.387
I owe you the world."

29:11.394 --> 29:12.305
And then...

29:13.794 --> 29:14.894
...and then he left...

29:16.194 --> 29:18.344
...and I didn't see
him again for six years.

29:20.833 --> 29:22.745
How many 'p's in 'deprivation'?

29:28.073 --> 29:28.904
Just one.

29:29.793 --> 29:30.624
One.

29:36.393 --> 29:40.306
Coffee cake. That was your mum's favourite.

29:40.592 --> 29:41.469
I know.

29:42.992 --> 29:45.666
Your mum was a big fan of cake in general.

29:47.432 --> 29:49.382
She always made a cake for my birthday.

29:49.712 --> 29:50.509
Aye.

29:53.512 --> 29:55.162
D'you remember when you were six?

29:56.192 --> 30:01.111
Your mum and I took you to Edinburgh zoo
and the monkeys threw rotten fruit at us.

30:01.112 --> 30:04.390
I slipped on a bit. Fractured
my foot in three places.

30:04.391 --> 30:07.463
Those monkeys were laughing
at us. Do you remember?

30:07.511 --> 30:09.104
Yeah. I remember.

30:13.591 --> 30:17.028
That's in your book, isn't it?
'Happy Thing'.

30:18.231 --> 30:20.270
'Ending'. It's called 'Happy Ending'.

30:20.271 --> 30:23.710
And, yes, the main character
does go to the zoo with her dad...

30:23.711 --> 30:27.101
...but he's not you, and they're
not monkeys, they're penguins.

30:29.230 --> 30:30.869
Do penguins throw fruit?

30:32.830 --> 30:36.580
It's different. It's a story, not real life.
You know, they're not the same.

30:38.230 --> 30:41.462
Whatever you say. Damn monkeys.

30:45.270 --> 30:46.260
How's the new book doing?

30:46.470 --> 30:47.301
Oh it's cooking.

30:48.870 --> 30:49.746
And Tommy?

30:50.549 --> 30:53.988
Don't call him Tommy. His name is
Thomas Duval. He's from Saint-Tropez.

30:53.989 --> 30:55.748
A place they named a fake tan after.

30:55.749 --> 30:58.628
You call him Tommy you make
him sound like he's from here.

30:58.629 --> 31:01.828
Like he's... normal. With his
'ouiii' and his stupid stubbly face.

31:01.829 --> 31:03.729
See a lot of Thomas Duvals round here?

31:03.989 --> 31:06.889
There was a Jean-Claude Darcheville,
he played for Rangers.

31:07.509 --> 31:11.548
Anyway, forget about Tom. I'm about to
sign with a new publisher. Klinsch & McLeish

31:11.549 --> 31:13.399
y'know with the red and white covers?

31:14.348 --> 31:15.941
I liked him. I liked Tom.

31:16.188 --> 31:16.985
Dad.

31:17.068 --> 31:21.168
I mean, nobody else wanted your wee book,
did they? I mean, he showed faith in you.

31:21.668 --> 31:24.900
No, he showed faith in my book.
You know he changed my original title?

31:25.108 --> 31:26.098
- Did he?
- Yes.

31:26.148 --> 31:28.299
Was it a good title?
That's not the point.

31:28.348 --> 31:30.348
What was it?
What was the original title?

31:30.628 --> 31:32.699
Uh.. nothing. Nothing. It doesn't matter.

31:33.188 --> 31:35.866
Oh tell me. I mean I
like that kind of stuff.

31:35.867 --> 31:40.225
You know, stuff that other people
don't know. Makes me feel closer to you.

31:41.587 --> 31:46.901
Okay. But.. okay. I was going to call it...
'The Endless Anguish of My Father'.

31:50.907 --> 31:55.706
For fuck's sake! 'The
Endless Anguish of My Father'.

31:55.707 --> 31:58.858
I knew it was about me, I knew it.

31:59.666 --> 32:02.166
No, it's not about you.
It's a character I made up.

32:02.226 --> 32:04.985
People at work looked at me
differently when it came out.

32:04.986 --> 32:06.886
I knew it. I'm away back to the depot.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.785
No, you never read it.
You're not allowed to be...

32:09.786 --> 32:12.545
...hurt until you've
actually read the damn thing!

32:12.546 --> 32:15.903
D'you not think I'm hurt my
own dad hasn't read my novel?

32:18.106 --> 32:22.463
I will read it. I'll read just as soon
as I get over my 'anguish'.

32:26.265 --> 32:27.062
Dad?

32:41.625 --> 32:43.105
Target acquired. Over.

32:43.785 --> 32:47.623
It's a pot plant, Roddy.
Not a North Korean reactor.

32:47.624 --> 32:50.776
Just warn me if either
of them comes back.

32:50.944 --> 32:52.844
Roger that. Understood loud and clear.

32:53.864 --> 32:55.378
That is a solid copy.

33:03.984 --> 33:07.421
Right. Time for some low-level unhappiness.

33:19.703 --> 33:20.693
'Twilight Sad'.

33:29.063 --> 33:30.313
Hey Roddy, are you there?

33:49.702 --> 33:54.139
Maverick to Iceman, we are Oscar Mike.

33:57.181 --> 33:58.979
Five klicks from extraction point.

34:01.621 --> 34:03.977
We have a clean visual... bollocks.

34:04.021 --> 34:05.899
Err, Tom? Tom? She's back.

34:07.341 --> 34:08.138
What?

34:08.221 --> 34:09.571
She's coming up the stairs.

34:09.821 --> 34:10.618
Shit.

34:11.621 --> 34:14.534
Damn it, man. Get out of there.
Abort! Abort!

35:08.298 --> 35:11.448
Oh that's horrible. She's really upset.
I'm not looking at that.

35:15.178 --> 35:17.773
Yes. Ow. What was that for?

35:19.658 --> 35:21.158
You're enjoying this too much.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.331
It's for her own good.

35:25.698 --> 35:27.998
And it's not as if I
actually killed her plant.

36:23.175 --> 36:25.531
- So what do you think?
- I think this is the end of Les Miserables.

36:25.575 --> 36:27.625
Yes. You should write
something like that.

36:27.655 --> 36:29.694
Oh, yes, thank you. Great suggestion.

36:29.695 --> 36:32.734
Bit French? People dying
of consumption and all that?

36:32.735 --> 36:36.614
I'm a bit more Urban Scotland.
Primal Scream. Unhappy 90's childhood.

36:36.654 --> 36:38.454
- Sorry?
- She wasn't talking to you.

36:40.174 --> 36:41.374
I wasn't talking to you.

36:49.054 --> 36:50.454
- Willie?
- Hmm?

36:52.294 --> 36:55.492
Do your characters ever... talk to you?

36:56.534 --> 37:01.767
Sure. All the time. That's why I've
got this. Drowns out the bastards.

37:02.453 --> 37:06.083
See, when I'm writing, I like
to hear the one voice. Mine.

37:06.413 --> 37:08.564
Charming. Quite the hero.

37:10.253 --> 37:11.209
You still blocked?

37:32.972 --> 37:34.850
101 Ways to Beat Writer's Block?

37:38.172 --> 37:39.472
Beat Your Block To A Pulp?

37:44.332 --> 37:46.243
What Would Jesus Write? Seriously?

37:47.491 --> 37:48.810
Okay. Okay, so what's the deal?

37:48.811 --> 37:51.121
Are you going to stalk me
until you finish my novel?

37:51.331 --> 37:54.483
Yes, I believe that's how it works.
Now, can we talk about the last chapter?

37:54.771 --> 37:55.602
What about it?

37:56.051 --> 37:58.751
I'm a romantic heroine.
I don't want to end up unhappy.

37:58.851 --> 38:01.250
It's not that easy. You don't
really get to choose your ending.

38:01.251 --> 38:03.686
It has to follow from what came
before, or it doesn't feel true.

38:03.971 --> 38:09.970
Please. I want it all to turn out okay.
Jane, don't let us down, darling...

38:10.090 --> 38:10.887
Jane Lockhart?

38:12.210 --> 38:15.969
I thought it was you. Shona
Heywood, proprietor of Mocha Books.

38:15.970 --> 38:21.204
Can I just say it's such a pleasure to meet
the woman who helped pay for my new kitchen.

38:23.570 --> 38:25.050
It is, it's her. It's her.

38:26.130 --> 38:30.920
I just loved 'Happy Ending'. It's so sad.

38:30.969 --> 38:32.369
I can't wait for your next one.

38:32.409 --> 38:33.559
- What's it called?
- Is it finished yet?

38:34.049 --> 38:35.403
Well, it's going to be, err...

38:35.489 --> 38:38.288
It must be difficult. I
mean, so much to live up to.

38:38.289 --> 38:42.124
How do you come back after the
extraordinary success of 'Happy Ending'?

38:45.169 --> 38:46.848
We are interrupting the muse.

38:46.849 --> 38:49.608
I'm sure you're eager
to get back to the page.

38:49.609 --> 38:50.440
Oh yes.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.529
And I have my eye on
a gorgeous bathroom.

38:54.688 --> 38:56.447
Please, take that, with my compliments.

38:56.448 --> 38:58.898
- I just need to run that through the till..
- No!

39:00.808 --> 39:01.685
Blocked?

39:29.607 --> 39:30.484
Dad.

39:31.567 --> 39:32.444
Come in.

39:32.847 --> 39:34.147
I was just making strudel.

39:35.127 --> 39:37.278
I can't stay anyway. Err...

39:39.087 --> 39:40.237
I just wanted to say...

39:43.486 --> 39:47.446
I had it in my head,
what I was going to say.

39:48.966 --> 39:51.116
I don't suppose you're
ever stuck for words.

39:53.606 --> 39:57.839
Listen. We don't really know each other.

39:58.606 --> 40:01.565
And I would like to get to know you.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.364
And I'm making a mess of it again.

40:05.325 --> 40:07.237
The other day, in the cemetery...

40:09.205 --> 40:13.404
I was out of order. I was and I'm sorry.

40:13.405 --> 40:18.116
I'm really sorry
darlin'. Right, that's it.

40:18.165 --> 40:21.164
I've said it and, err,
I'm going to go and meet...

40:21.165 --> 40:24.397
...the boys for quiz practice.
I'm off, okay. I'm off.

40:25.445 --> 40:26.275
Dad?

40:32.164 --> 40:38.164
It's okay. Look, I know how
complicated all of this is and, err...

40:39.764 --> 40:41.114
Can I be on your quiz team?

40:48.604 --> 40:52.643
I think maybe you're a bit
busy for a daft quiz team.

40:55.643 --> 41:00.923
Please. I'd like to. Get to know you.

41:03.163 --> 41:04.040
Really?

41:04.523 --> 41:05.354
Really.

41:08.523 --> 41:13.119
Great. Great. We need you.

41:14.522 --> 41:18.198
Rory's showing signs of early
dementia. That would be great.

41:35.721 --> 41:37.360
Welcome to the family.

41:37.401 --> 41:38.994
Thanks. Thanks so much.

41:39.561 --> 41:42.240
Please excuse Doctor
Klinsch, she does have...

41:42.241 --> 41:45.552
...a tendency to pee her pants
when we sign a new author.

41:45.601 --> 41:46.955
That was just the one time.

41:47.361 --> 41:50.200
Okay. Klinsch & McLeish.
I can't quite believe it.

41:50.201 --> 41:54.200
I'm going to be published in one of
those classic red and white covers.

41:54.201 --> 41:58.080
It's obviously it's not just about
the covers but they're so pretty.

41:58.081 --> 42:01.391
Your list is amazing too.
I mean, you publish Glen Buchan.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.394
Ah Glen. Fabulous writer.

42:03.440 --> 42:05.740
And you know that you
have something in common.

42:05.800 --> 42:11.592
Really? No. What? You think so? God,
he's up there with Rushdie and McEwan.

42:13.480 --> 42:15.799
Quite possibly. No, what
I meant was that you...

42:15.800 --> 42:18.200
...were both discovered
by your former publisher.

42:18.440 --> 42:19.271
Tom?

42:19.320 --> 42:22.158
Yes, it didn't last. They
went their separate ways...

42:22.159 --> 42:24.674
...before the first novel
was published. By us.

42:25.719 --> 42:27.233
Well, yeah. Sounds like Tom.

42:27.559 --> 42:30.552
Anyway, enough of the past.
Here's to the future.

42:40.439 --> 42:41.236
It's exciting.

42:51.478 --> 42:53.117
Blocked in this too, eh?

43:02.358 --> 43:06.408
I'm so sorry. Would you just excuse us, me,
for one second? Where's your bathroom?

43:09.757 --> 43:10.873
Okay, what are you doing here?

43:10.957 --> 43:12.907
Well, I've figured out what's going on.

43:14.437 --> 43:16.756
You can't write the ending
because once it's finished...

43:16.757 --> 43:19.057
...you'll have no reason
to see Tom ever again.

43:21.477 --> 43:24.276
Oh that is such a load of rubbish.

43:25.157 --> 43:27.911
Jane dear? Is everything alright?

43:27.957 --> 43:30.357
Err yes. Yes, fine.
I'll just be out in a minute.

43:34.236 --> 43:38.555
In case you haven't noticed, I'm about to
leave Tom and sign with a new publisher.

43:38.556 --> 43:40.195
Oh, and one more minor detail...

43:40.196 --> 43:43.473
I'm not writing my ending. I'm
writing yours. And I'm not you.

43:43.676 --> 43:45.835
No, of course not. And your
first novel wasn't a barely...

43:45.836 --> 43:48.146
...fictionalised account of your
relationship with your father.

43:48.876 --> 43:52.028
Oh, and remind me, what's your
middle name again? Jane Darsie Lockhart.

43:52.156 --> 43:53.555
Well that means nothing. And anyway...

43:53.556 --> 43:56.156
...I was thinking of changing
your name, so you can..

44:00.555 --> 44:01.386
Still here.

44:06.355 --> 44:07.471
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

44:08.635 --> 44:12.265
Now then young lady.
Ready to go with a real publisher?

44:24.154 --> 44:27.104
Let me get this straight.
You only take on writers you love?

44:27.194 --> 44:28.787
Writing I love.

44:29.434 --> 44:30.629
How interesting.

44:31.194 --> 44:35.507
No, no it isn't. Can we get
back to making Jane miserable?

44:36.834 --> 44:38.507
Fine. If that's what you really want.

44:38.554 --> 44:41.254
Have you thought about what
will happen if you succeed?

44:43.233 --> 44:46.271
Yes. I win.

44:46.993 --> 44:48.950
Yes. But you'll lose her.

44:50.073 --> 44:52.952
Who cares? It's not as if she wants to stay.

44:59.153 --> 45:03.431
Motivation. The heart of
self-improvement. A. Achieve your dreams.

45:03.432 --> 45:06.111
Avoid negative people,
things and places.

45:06.112 --> 45:11.790
B. Believe in yourself. What you can do. C.
Consider things on every angle and aspect...

45:13.152 --> 45:15.064
One of us really needs to get laid.

45:15.712 --> 45:16.987
Oh God yes.

45:19.272 --> 45:22.504
We should, next week.
There's a girl at the chippy.

45:24.872 --> 45:28.190
Q. Quitters never win.
And winners never quit.

45:28.191 --> 45:33.107
So choose your fate. Are you going
to be a quitter or a winner? R...

45:33.871 --> 45:36.989
Okay. Here's a thought.
We could kill her dog.

45:37.191 --> 45:38.181
I didn't know she had a dog.

45:38.231 --> 45:41.190
She doesn't.
We could buy her one and then kill it.

45:42.831 --> 45:44.345
It wouldn't be a cute dog.

45:44.591 --> 45:47.743
And you don't think that's a little bit,
how can I put this, psychotic?

45:48.071 --> 45:50.630
Yeah, you're right. She hasn't got a dog.

45:53.470 --> 45:55.462
But she has got a screenwriter.

45:56.070 --> 46:00.064
I'm not helping you
kill Willie Scott, am I? Tom?

46:18.749 --> 46:20.945
Damn it. She's still baking.

46:22.829 --> 46:24.627
Back, you cupcakes of Satan.

46:26.069 --> 46:27.583
Okay. Here goes.

46:40.748 --> 46:41.943
I hate these things.

46:43.548 --> 46:46.248
Yeah, I prefer the Routemaster
Two Six Seven Oh myself.

46:50.188 --> 46:52.100
It's a bus joke. Sorry.

46:55.828 --> 46:59.706
No, no. I get it. It's
just I've never really...

46:59.707 --> 47:03.462
...met anyone else who
made a bus joke before.

47:10.787 --> 47:11.664
Hello Jane.

47:12.667 --> 47:13.867
Hello. What do you want?

47:14.467 --> 47:20.065
I'll tell you what I don't want.
I don't want a cupcake.

47:20.467 --> 47:23.185
So. Two writers living
under the same roof...

47:23.186 --> 47:26.345
...how's that working out?
I imagine it's fantastic:

47:26.346 --> 47:31.296
...Sharing ideas, the ebb and flow of
discussion. Willie must be a great boon.

47:31.346 --> 47:32.496
Oh yes. Yes, he is.

47:32.786 --> 47:35.086
So what does the
Big Man make of the new novel?

47:37.306 --> 47:40.106
You're right. It's not fair
to ask you. I should ask him.

47:40.386 --> 47:44.221
No, no, no. He loves it. He just loves it.
Naturally he has notes...

47:44.466 --> 47:45.342
Naturally.

47:49.065 --> 47:52.422
Willie has not asked to
read one single page, has he?

47:52.665 --> 47:54.497
He's very busy with his screenplay.

47:54.625 --> 47:57.015
Ah yes, the adaptation. How's that going?

47:57.065 --> 47:59.455
Terrific. Oh it's going terrific... Iy.

48:01.985 --> 48:07.219
You don't know, do you?
He doesn't discuss it with you.

48:08.624 --> 48:09.421
What's your point?

48:09.464 --> 48:10.341
He's using you.

48:11.584 --> 48:13.034
That's rich, coming from you.

48:13.824 --> 48:16.423
Come on, it's common
knowledge he wouldn't be...

48:16.424 --> 48:19.183
...adapting 'Happy Ending'
if you hadn't insisted.

48:19.184 --> 48:22.423
Willie Scott's writing career
peaked sometime around 1998.

48:22.424 --> 48:23.863
He's a talentless hack...

48:23.864 --> 48:25.743
...without a brain or a conscious...

48:25.744 --> 48:28.543
...who doesn't give a damn
about your or your novel!

48:31.503 --> 48:32.698
- Yeah.
- Behind you.

48:37.303 --> 48:38.180
Hey.

48:38.823 --> 48:39.700
Willie!

49:03.822 --> 49:04.772
Is that fruit cake?

49:04.902 --> 49:09.977
Oh, yes. It's frozen. I brought
a couple of spares. It's for your nose.

49:11.702 --> 49:14.661
Look, I'm sorry about Willie.
He shouldn't have hit you.

49:14.662 --> 49:16.301
Even though you did deserve it.

49:18.741 --> 49:20.300
He caught me off guard.

49:20.301 --> 49:23.499
Usually I don't go down
after the first punch.

49:24.021 --> 49:26.741
Usually it's about the third or fourth.

49:28.741 --> 49:29.691
How did I get here?

49:30.541 --> 49:31.741
I made Willie carry you.

49:33.461 --> 49:34.577
No you didn't.

49:34.941 --> 49:35.818
What's wrong now?

49:35.901 --> 49:39.815
It's not very manly, being carried
upstairs by another bloke.

49:41.980 --> 49:43.330
He's not still here, is he?

49:43.460 --> 49:45.260
No, I sent him outside to calm down.

49:53.420 --> 49:57.334
Look, Jane. There's
something I need to tell you.

49:58.900 --> 50:00.550
Something I've never said before.

50:04.699 --> 50:06.656
What's the capital of Ethiopia?

50:19.699 --> 50:21.850
We're in the finals, actually.

50:23.979 --> 50:24.856
So that was it.

50:27.098 --> 50:28.598
That's what you needed to say?

50:30.418 --> 50:34.412
No. No, no.

50:41.098 --> 50:42.930
I... What I meant to say is...

50:44.178 --> 50:45.009
'Happy Ending'.

50:47.338 --> 50:52.093
At the end, when things became...
you know... with us.

50:56.697 --> 50:57.497
And the title...

51:02.457 --> 51:06.417
I never told you... the book.

51:10.297 --> 51:11.128
It's good.

51:14.936 --> 51:17.136
It's like the saddest music I've ever heard.

51:23.736 --> 51:26.615
What the hell was that? What are you up to?

51:26.856 --> 51:27.653
I'm not up to anything.

51:27.696 --> 51:30.655
Yes you are. All this 'sad music'
crap, and filling my head...

51:30.656 --> 51:33.906
...with doubts about Willie. Why
would you do that, why? Unless...

51:35.655 --> 51:39.365
Unless... Oh, I know why.

51:40.495 --> 51:43.055
You want me to sign a
new book deal with you.

51:43.255 --> 51:47.134
Well, if you can hear me through the
obvious concussion, pay attention.

51:47.135 --> 51:48.888
It is. Never. Going. To. Happen.

51:49.095 --> 51:50.095
I have a concussion?

51:50.255 --> 51:51.814
Oh get off. Get off this bus.

51:55.735 --> 51:56.612
You know what?

51:58.095 --> 52:02.850
You really think I'd want you back?
Why? Why would I do that to myself?

52:05.534 --> 52:07.053
You're distant at the best of times.

52:07.054 --> 52:10.654
And when you're writing your characters
were more real to you than I was.

52:18.614 --> 52:24.613
So, no, Jane. I do not want you back.
I do not want you back.

52:35.893 --> 52:38.362
So, how's the screenplay coming along?

52:39.253 --> 52:40.084
Hmm?

52:40.333 --> 52:45.411
Your screenplay? I was just thinking
we haven't really discussed it much...

52:45.412 --> 52:50.491
...at all... and since, well, I wrote
the novel, maybe I could, you know...

52:50.492 --> 52:53.803
What I mean is, we should
have more ebb and flow.

52:54.732 --> 52:55.832
That's not a bad idea.

52:56.572 --> 52:58.531
You know the scene in the
book where her father...

52:58.532 --> 53:01.047
...goes on a bender and doesn't
turn up for the mother's funeral?

53:01.492 --> 53:04.371
Yes. I remember.

53:04.812 --> 53:05.712
Would you miss it?

53:08.651 --> 53:10.768
What? What? You can't...

53:12.731 --> 53:14.962
Willie, I think we need
to talk this through.

53:15.011 --> 53:15.967
I know what this is about, Janey.

53:16.491 --> 53:19.086
You haven't written a word in two weeks.

53:19.531 --> 53:23.047
So you want to talk, instead
of dealing with your blockage.

53:23.331 --> 53:24.811
How many times? I am not blocked.

53:24.851 --> 53:29.930
There was this writer I knew, got stuck
on a 'Long Lost Sibling' story arc.

53:29.931 --> 53:34.049
Thought it was going to end his
career but... but he beat it.

53:35.050 --> 53:35.927
Do you know how?

53:36.530 --> 53:37.361
How?

53:40.650 --> 53:42.050
He wrote naked.

53:43.890 --> 53:45.722
Yeah. Yeah, right.

53:45.930 --> 53:46.886
Seriously.

53:47.530 --> 53:50.329
The idea is you release
yourself from the restrictions...

53:50.330 --> 53:54.209
...of the everyday so that you can express
your ideas in an uninhibited fashion.

53:54.249 --> 53:57.208
Oh, okay. I think you just
want to be able to sit there...

53:57.209 --> 53:59.246
...and write while you stare at my tits.

54:00.729 --> 54:02.163
They are great tits.

54:20.968 --> 54:22.243
It's not a weapon, Jade.

54:25.368 --> 54:27.018
There's some blood on this stick.

54:41.847 --> 54:42.644
Tom.

54:49.207 --> 54:51.157
I've got some business to take care of.

55:07.326 --> 55:09.165
I want it on record that
this is going too far, okay?

55:09.166 --> 55:11.442
She's only just started rebuilding
her relationship with her dad.

55:11.526 --> 55:14.445
I'm just trying to help
her finish her book.

55:14.446 --> 55:17.085
And she'll thank me in the end.

55:17.086 --> 55:19.806
First we get rid of Willie,
then we work on papa.

55:20.286 --> 55:25.525
So Mr Scott, Willie, our senior development
executive has been looking for a...

55:25.526 --> 55:29.164
...a very special screenwriter
with a distinctive voice...

55:29.165 --> 55:32.442
...for a project which she
has slated for next year.

55:33.925 --> 55:34.802
Yeah?

55:35.325 --> 55:38.644
When she heard you were
adapting Jane Lockhart's

55:38.645 --> 55:42.275
'Happy Ending', she was
excited. We were all excited.

55:43.525 --> 55:47.405
What company is this again?
I mean have you spoken to my agent or...?

55:47.645 --> 55:49.875
Yeah. Thank you Priscilla.
You too. Ciao, ciao, ciao.

55:50.244 --> 55:52.520
Sure. She put us right on to you.

55:54.444 --> 55:57.198
But if you're too busy right now,
perhaps we should just leave it?

55:57.284 --> 56:00.038
Oh no, no no. No.

56:00.644 --> 56:02.442
No, no, I'm excited. It's...

56:03.644 --> 56:07.718
...You know it's not just adaptations
that I do. I have my own material you know.

56:07.764 --> 56:09.960
Terrific. Well...

56:10.524 --> 56:16.523
...you can share all that
with our senior VP Bob...

56:16.683 --> 56:20.882
...and our head of deputy
acquisitions Vonda who...

56:20.923 --> 56:24.373
They're going to be over there next
Friday. You live in London, right?

56:24.763 --> 56:29.280
Well, err.. mainly. But you know I've got
my place upcountry too you know, obviously.

56:29.883 --> 56:34.202
Well apologies, but it may involve
dragging you out to the middle of nowhere...

56:34.203 --> 56:36.433
...but we're scouting Steven's next pic.

56:37.122 --> 56:39.034
Steven? Segal?

56:39.682 --> 56:43.039
Soderbergh. He'll probably
drop by to say hi if that's okay?

56:43.682 --> 56:45.594
Aye, that would be fine.

56:51.922 --> 56:52.719
Taxi's here.

56:53.202 --> 56:54.102
Where's my ticket?

56:54.642 --> 56:56.395
It's in your bag where
you put it two minutes ago.

56:56.882 --> 56:58.840
Jane, this is an important trip for me.

56:58.841 --> 57:01.000
These people are
working with Soderbergh.

57:01.001 --> 57:03.232
They called me and
that just never happens.

57:04.281 --> 57:06.318
You're right. It doesn't.

57:07.801 --> 57:09.201
And it's all because of you.

57:10.401 --> 57:14.600
The truth is, they would never have asked to
see me if I hadn't been adapting your novel.

57:14.641 --> 57:17.041
Oh, that is rubbish.
Look, you're a great writer.

57:18.201 --> 57:19.681
Yeah, you're right.

57:20.681 --> 57:21.671
Where's my treatments?
Did you tidy them?

57:21.761 --> 57:23.114
Willie. Breathe.

57:29.880 --> 57:30.680
How you feeling?

57:31.040 --> 57:31.837
Good.

57:32.680 --> 57:33.559
Sharp?

57:33.560 --> 57:34.357
Sharp, aye.

57:35.400 --> 57:36.231
Gordon?

57:36.640 --> 57:39.559
I'm prime., yeah. Mind you,
I'm a bit worried because...

57:39.560 --> 57:41.836
...we don't know what
he's going to ask us.

57:43.320 --> 57:44.959
It's a quiz. It's a quiz Gordon.

57:45.039 --> 57:45.916
Oh right.

57:47.879 --> 57:48.756
Mr L?

57:49.679 --> 57:51.830
Tom. Good to see you mate.

57:53.679 --> 57:54.556
Big night, eh?

57:55.319 --> 57:57.598
Big night. Big night,
aye. This is the final.

57:57.599 --> 58:01.036
The winner gets a holiday in America.
And two tickets to Disneyland.

58:01.319 --> 58:03.470
Wow, that's wonderful. Good luck with that.

58:03.879 --> 58:08.957
Thanks Tom. Thanks. Listen, I know that Jane
and you haven't always seen eye-to-eye...

58:08.958 --> 58:12.269
...but I'm sure she'll be
really happy to see you again.

58:13.438 --> 58:14.235
Where is she?

58:14.278 --> 58:17.228
Oh she's not here yet.
But the quiz doesn't start til eight.

58:17.918 --> 58:20.717
Oh, well, plenty of time then.

58:20.878 --> 58:21.928
Oh, plenty of time...

58:31.397 --> 58:35.073
That was quick. I wasn't expecting
you for another ten minutes.

58:35.317 --> 58:38.116
Oh I was just around the corner.
Where you going?

58:38.797 --> 58:40.497
East End please. The Walter Scott.

58:40.637 --> 58:41.468
No problem.

58:47.797 --> 58:48.697
What do you think?

58:48.957 --> 58:49.754
Lovely.

58:50.597 --> 58:52.047
Me and the lads discussed it.

58:52.517 --> 58:54.117
We're going to make her captain.

58:54.316 --> 59:00.316
When she was a little girl, every penny her
mother gave her she put in the piggy bank.

59:00.556 --> 59:06.115
Saving up, you know, to go to Disneyland.
Every birthday it was Mickey Mouse...

59:06.116 --> 59:10.875
...Mickey Mouse, Disneyland, Mickey
Mouse, you know. Every birthday.

59:10.876 --> 59:13.471
Well... until the seventh birthday.

59:19.515 --> 59:24.351
Her mother took her to Woolworths
for her present, a gift.

59:24.555 --> 59:27.548
And, well they were late getting back.

59:28.995 --> 59:33.512
I lost it, Tom, you know. I was...
'I want my dinner on the table' and...

59:38.355 --> 59:42.428
That was the night I walked out on them.

59:45.394 --> 59:47.844
If only that was the worst
thing I did that night.

59:51.794 --> 59:53.294
Excuse me. Where are we going?

59:54.874 --> 59:55.724
The Rabbie Burns.

59:56.034 --> 59:57.234
I said The Walter Scott.

59:58.714 --> 59:59.591
You sure?

59:59.754 --> 01:00:01.029
Of course I'm sure.

01:00:01.194 --> 01:00:02.787
Hey. There's no need for that.

01:00:02.834 --> 01:00:06.992
They're both iconic pillars of our
national literature, arguably responsible...

01:00:06.993 --> 01:00:09.752
...for the over-romanticisation
of Scottish history...

01:00:09.753 --> 01:00:12.313
...that persists to this
day. Easy mistake to make.

01:00:12.513 --> 01:00:15.426
Alright, please. Just please hurry. Please.

01:00:18.993 --> 01:00:20.792
Hello it's Benny Lockhart here.

01:00:20.793 --> 01:00:24.992
If you leave a message then I'll get
back to you soon. Okey-dokes. Bye.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.592
Do you know why they were late back?

01:00:34.592 --> 01:00:35.423
Yeah.

01:00:36.072 --> 01:00:38.872
Yeah of course you do
because it's in the book, isn't it?

01:00:42.552 --> 01:00:44.623
Her mother dropped dead in Woolworths.

01:00:47.232 --> 01:00:51.590
Her mother was lying dead in
the Pick And Mix aisle and her...

01:00:51.591 --> 01:00:55.426
...daddy was spending her
Mickey Mouse money on booze.

01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:04.620
I swore I would never touch
another drop after that. Not a drop.

01:01:12.031 --> 01:01:13.831
You look familiar. You on the telly?

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:17.345
Err no. I've done a few interviews but...

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:21.306
You're that writer, Jane something.
My wife read your book.

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:22.427
Oh yeah?

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:23.347
Aye, what's it called again?

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:24.469
'Happy Ending'.

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:27.029
'Happy Ending', aye. She was
greeting her eyes out by the end.

01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:28.680
And you wrote it? That's amazing.

01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:32.010
God you must be a right miserable cow.

01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:35.760
Do I know you from...

01:01:39.269 --> 01:01:40.069
I'm out of fags.

01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:44.309
What? Hey, no. Come back!
We need to get to the...

01:01:45.749 --> 01:01:46.546
Pub.

01:01:51.909 --> 01:01:52.706
Hey!

01:01:59.388 --> 01:02:00.538
Years later...

01:02:02.308 --> 01:02:07.178
...I discovered that the police brought
her back. Two minutes after I'd left home.

01:02:09.588 --> 01:02:10.465
Two minutes, Tom.

01:02:12.308 --> 01:02:17.667
You know, I realise that I can
never make it up to that little girl.

01:02:17.708 --> 01:02:20.701
That seven year-old Jane.

01:02:22.907 --> 01:02:27.140
Can't do it. But if we win tonight, Tom...

01:02:29.467 --> 01:02:33.546
If we win tonight, I'm going
to take her to Disneyland.

01:02:33.547 --> 01:02:39.066
Aye, I don't mean the shite one in
Paris. The real Disneyland. No offence.

01:02:40.747 --> 01:02:41.578
None taken.

01:02:43.107 --> 01:02:47.703
Gentlemen, ladies, can you please
take your places for the quiz final.

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:51.616
She'll be here. She'll be here.

01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:55.306
Nothing's going to happen.
Not again. No. No.

01:02:59.266 --> 01:03:00.382
Help! Help!

01:03:10.505 --> 01:03:12.622
You know what? I'll see you in a second.

01:03:18.345 --> 01:03:19.144
Tom.

01:03:19.145 --> 01:03:22.377
Roddy. Call it off. Call it off.
Bring her here immediately.

01:03:22.985 --> 01:03:26.661
She's gone. We've lost her.

01:03:28.585 --> 01:03:29.416
In Cambuslang.

01:03:55.023 --> 01:03:55.820
Sorry!

01:04:08.023 --> 01:04:13.542
Captains, last call. Can you please bring
your team lists to the adjudicator's table.

01:04:18.822 --> 01:04:19.653
Benny...

01:04:20.142 --> 01:04:22.418
If I don't get your list
you'll forfeit your place.

01:04:22.502 --> 01:04:23.379
Benny, come on.

01:04:23.622 --> 01:04:24.817
Come on Benny.

01:04:25.022 --> 01:04:26.172
Two more minutes, lads.

01:04:42.221 --> 01:04:46.056
Benny... I'm.. I'm sorry.

01:04:46.381 --> 01:04:49.340
It's okay, son. It's not your fault.

01:04:49.501 --> 01:04:50.491
Well, actually...

01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:53.176
Right, okay. That's enough.
Let's get on with this.

01:04:54.181 --> 01:04:56.776
Welcome, ladies and
gentlemen to the grand final...

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:04.577
Dad.

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:06.817
Dad.

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:16.498
Question one...
Who was William Shakespeare's wife?

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:23.414
The indisputable winners...
Benny and his Jets!

01:05:31.739 --> 01:05:33.412
Whooah!

01:05:58.498 --> 01:06:00.171
Fact is...

01:06:01.618 --> 01:06:06.693
...we're not dog-killers. What's
the worst thing we actually achieved?

01:06:07.738 --> 01:06:12.971
Kidnapping a pot plant.

01:06:13.017 --> 01:06:19.017
There's our fatal flaw.
At heart, we're nice guys.

01:06:25.457 --> 01:06:27.107
I'm going to tell her everything.

01:06:37.816 --> 01:06:40.566
I will not do nudity unless
it is essential to the plot.

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:55.005
Oh, you must be joking.

01:06:55.696 --> 01:06:56.527
Jane?

01:06:59.575 --> 01:07:00.452
Just go away.

01:07:00.855 --> 01:07:03.415
I've got to talk to you.
Please open the door.

01:07:06.895 --> 01:07:07.745
Hold on a minute.

01:07:10.415 --> 01:07:11.292
Willie?

01:07:11.335 --> 01:07:13.614
You need to hear about our
great deal on home insurance.

01:07:13.615 --> 01:07:15.374
- Have you ever thought about what would...
- Jane? Your meringues, Jane.

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:17.571
...happen if your house caught fire?

01:07:17.815 --> 01:07:18.646
Shit.

01:07:20.175 --> 01:07:21.211
Jane! You okay?

01:07:25.214 --> 01:07:26.204
Shit. Shit. Shit.

01:07:26.974 --> 01:07:27.805
Shit!

01:07:32.134 --> 01:07:32.931
Shit.

01:07:39.734 --> 01:07:40.531
I...

01:07:40.894 --> 01:07:41.725
Stop looking!

01:07:48.173 --> 01:07:50.223
What the hell are you doing here, anyway?

01:07:50.613 --> 01:07:52.684
I came to apolo... Whoah.

01:07:55.893 --> 01:07:56.743
Is that my novel?

01:08:00.373 --> 01:08:02.763
No, no, no. Give that back. Give it back!

01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:06.813
I paid good money for this.
I'm going to read it.

01:08:06.853 --> 01:08:09.353
You don't get to read
anything until it's finished.

01:08:12.012 --> 01:08:12.843
Okay.

01:08:15.212 --> 01:08:16.089
Here.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:19.241
Thank you.

01:08:20.011 --> 01:08:22.004
Good to know you can behave
like a grown-up once in a...

01:08:22.292 --> 01:08:23.772
Where's the rest of it?

01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:30.212
Hey, come out of there!
You thieving bastard! Give me back my novel!

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:47.006
How could you do that?
I can't believe you. Even you.

01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:51.191
So what did you think?

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:55.282
It's merely the first couple
of chapters so who can say?

01:08:56.649 --> 01:08:57.800
However...

01:08:58.770 --> 01:09:01.649
...putting to one side
that you're a whining...

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:05.200
...overpaid author who clearly
got lucky with her debut...

01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:08.928
...I'd say this is a very good start.

01:09:10.569 --> 01:09:11.890
Well...

01:09:12.970 --> 01:09:16.920
...coming from a never-even-has-been
owner of a third-rate publishing company...

01:09:17.969 --> 01:09:19.419
...I'd have to say thank you.

01:09:21.609 --> 01:09:23.202
Naturally...

01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:26.044
...I have a few notes.

01:09:27.209 --> 01:09:28.040
Naturally.

01:09:33.448 --> 01:09:34.326
For instance...

01:09:40.608 --> 01:09:41.564
The first page...

01:09:41.768 --> 01:09:42.645
I don't get it.

01:10:35.326 --> 01:10:36.926
I'm just going to get the phone.

01:10:39.326 --> 01:10:40.965
- Willie?
- Hi Janey.

01:10:41.046 --> 01:10:43.845
Hi. How's the trip going?
Did you meet Soderbergh?

01:10:44.966 --> 01:10:46.016
There was no meeting.

01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:49.444
I've been stuck in the
arse end of nowhere...

01:10:49.486 --> 01:10:52.644
...couldn't get a cab, I've been walking
for nine hours in the rain, my phone died...

01:10:52.645 --> 01:10:54.445
...I've only just now found a phone.

01:10:54.565 --> 01:10:55.396
Oh Willie.

01:10:55.565 --> 01:10:57.955
I'm cold and wet and feeling so...

01:10:59.085 --> 01:11:00.360
...so miserable.

01:11:00.685 --> 01:11:04.838
You know, the funny things is, even
though the trip turned out so badly...

01:11:06.285 --> 01:11:12.285
You know, it made me realise a
few things. I miss you, Janey.

01:11:14.764 --> 01:11:16.714
You're the best thing in my life and...

01:11:20.084 --> 01:11:20.915
I love you.

01:11:22.564 --> 01:11:24.840
Janey, let's get married.

01:12:11.002 --> 01:12:11.799
There we go.

01:12:19.522 --> 01:12:20.399
He's sick.

01:12:20.442 --> 01:12:22.492
Oh come on, he's just
taking the piss now.

01:12:23.841 --> 01:12:26.515
He said he loves me. You heard him.

01:12:27.521 --> 01:12:30.371
Actually I didn't. Maybe it
was in your vivid imagination.

01:12:31.281 --> 01:12:34.877
And I love Willie too. He makes me... happy.

01:12:35.961 --> 01:12:37.998
Any chance of that cup of tea, doll?

01:12:41.281 --> 01:12:42.351
He's a sweetheart.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:08.870
Priscilla? Listen, sweetheart...

01:13:08.919 --> 01:13:10.069
...get out the big pen.

01:13:10.839 --> 01:13:16.073
Time to bill the bastards for my first
draft. I just finished the script.

01:13:23.759 --> 01:13:25.830
A lifetime with Willie Scott.

01:13:27.839 --> 01:13:30.798
If that doesn't make her
miserable, nothing will.

01:13:31.319 --> 01:13:34.516
Look, I know things haven't worked
out for the two of you but...

01:13:35.638 --> 01:13:40.952
Surely you don't really actually totally
completely want her to be unhappy?

01:13:40.998 --> 01:13:43.317
Of course I don't. I mean...

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:47.028
...Oh tu comprends
pas.. It's tricky, okay?

01:13:47.278 --> 01:13:48.109
Whatever.

01:14:05.437 --> 01:14:11.274
...which is why Shakespeare
never left New York again.

01:14:13.197 --> 01:14:18.396
Okay, chapter twenty-one. Read it or...

01:14:19.396 --> 01:14:21.513
...be punished. Yo.

01:14:21.636 --> 01:14:23.548
He's only gone and changed the ending.

01:14:23.996 --> 01:14:28.146
Wow. All you did was to change the title
and she thought you were a complete wanker.

01:14:28.156 --> 01:14:31.035
That's Juan Kerr.

01:14:31.396 --> 01:14:34.196
He was a nineteenth century
South American revolutionary.

01:14:35.116 --> 01:14:36.766
This is going to break her heart.

01:14:36.956 --> 01:14:37.833
Yeah well great.

01:14:39.036 --> 01:14:42.636
Now all you've got to do is make sure
she reads it. Mission accomplished.

01:14:42.955 --> 01:14:43.786
Yeah.

01:14:46.435 --> 01:14:47.985
You've given it a happy ending.

01:14:49.835 --> 01:14:50.632
And your point?

01:14:50.715 --> 01:14:52.965
The point is Jane's
novel doesn't end happily.

01:14:53.035 --> 01:14:56.073
Well who the hell wants to walk
out of a movie feeling miserable?

01:14:56.155 --> 01:14:57.271
You have to change it back.

01:14:57.315 --> 01:14:59.794
Oh I don't think so. That
script says more about...

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:02.345
...my love for her than I
could ever put into words.

01:15:02.435 --> 01:15:03.985
She doesn't know yet, does she?

01:15:06.834 --> 01:15:09.084
Do you have any idea
what this will do to her?

01:15:09.674 --> 01:15:10.471
To both of you?

01:15:11.474 --> 01:15:14.433
I made a mistake and
I can't take it back.

01:15:14.434 --> 01:15:16.949
But Willie, if you truly love her...

01:15:17.874 --> 01:15:18.671
Change it.

01:15:19.554 --> 01:15:20.604
What's going on here?

01:15:21.074 --> 01:15:22.394
You just don't get her, do you?

01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:23.948
Oh I get her all right.

01:15:25.114 --> 01:15:29.824
Every night I get her. Any way up I fancy.

01:15:34.473 --> 01:15:36.271
Hit a sick man, would you?

01:15:37.953 --> 01:15:38.784
Watch this.

01:15:48.873 --> 01:15:51.223
Remind me, does the bridge
explode in the novel?

01:15:54.432 --> 01:15:56.185
Hi Janey, I'm home.

01:15:57.432 --> 01:15:59.230
Any chance of a wee cup of tea?

01:16:02.312 --> 01:16:03.632
Willie!

01:16:04.112 --> 01:16:07.212
I just don't understand how you
can do this over a dumb ending.

01:16:07.432 --> 01:16:08.661
No. No, you don't.

01:16:08.712 --> 01:16:10.988
Well if it's any consolation Janey...

01:16:11.032 --> 01:16:12.466
...I don't think you and me
would have worked out anyway.

01:16:13.551 --> 01:16:17.591
I just don't get all that
worshipping your pain stuff.

01:16:22.111 --> 01:16:23.067
Daddy issues.

01:18:06.307 --> 01:18:09.707
Tom, if she hasn't delivered you have
to take Pandemic Media's offer.

01:18:09.986 --> 01:18:12.626
Mark my words, never going to happen.

01:18:13.506 --> 01:18:17.256
Well I'll have no option but to declare
you bankrupt and call in a Receiver.

01:18:25.466 --> 01:18:27.503
You're my Relationship Manager, right?

01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:28.776
Yes. So?

01:18:29.746 --> 01:18:31.846
So what should I do about my relationship?

01:18:31.945 --> 01:18:33.664
Oh for God's sake.

01:18:36.905 --> 01:18:37.782
Do you love her?

01:18:38.745 --> 01:18:39.576
Tom?

01:18:55.144 --> 01:18:55.941
Jane.

01:18:56.024 --> 01:18:56.855
Hi.

01:18:57.144 --> 01:18:58.021
Tom's not here.

01:18:58.544 --> 01:19:00.820
He should be back any
minute of you want to wait?

01:19:00.864 --> 01:19:02.617
No, I don't think so.

01:19:02.664 --> 01:19:04.514
I'm heading off for a bit of a break.

01:19:06.104 --> 01:19:09.541
I just came to drop this off.
It's my new novel. I finished it.

01:19:11.064 --> 01:19:13.181
That's a relief. Between
you and me your book's...

01:19:13.264 --> 01:19:15.814
...the only thing stopping
this place going tits up.

01:19:21.303 --> 01:19:22.603
So where shall I leave it?

01:19:24.863 --> 01:19:26.063
Just put it on his desk.

01:19:26.543 --> 01:19:27.420
Okay.

01:19:27.903 --> 01:19:28.700
Bye.

01:19:52.422 --> 01:19:53.253
Hold it.

01:19:53.662 --> 01:19:54.493
Jane.

01:19:55.902 --> 01:19:56.779
Jane!

01:19:58.782 --> 01:19:59.579
Bastard!

01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:37.411
Oh. Should I still be
seeing you? I finished it.

01:21:01.219 --> 01:21:04.451
Leave me alone. All I want is to be alone!

01:21:55.097 --> 01:21:55.894
Jane.

01:21:57.017 --> 01:21:57.894
Jane!

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:06.134
Listen, I know you're in there.

01:22:07.616 --> 01:22:10.166
And I know it sounds crazy
but I was trying to help.

01:22:12.576 --> 01:22:16.729
Jane. Your dad's worried
about you and so am I.

01:22:17.816 --> 01:22:19.266
He told me where to find you.

01:22:21.616 --> 01:22:24.847
All you care about is what my
book can do for your damn company.

01:22:24.895 --> 01:22:26.395
Well, you got what you wanted.

01:22:53.214 --> 01:22:54.614
Jane, please, open the door.

01:22:58.654 --> 01:23:02.125
Jane, I'm not good at
this countryside stuff. Alright?

01:23:05.454 --> 01:23:06.504
I think I saw a bear.

01:23:08.653 --> 01:23:09.530
Jane?

01:23:17.333 --> 01:23:18.164
I'm sorry.

01:23:42.132 --> 01:23:43.009
Thanks a lot.

01:23:48.732 --> 01:23:51.088
I deserve that. I'll just go, shall I?

01:23:53.372 --> 01:23:54.169
I'll go.

01:25:44.207 --> 01:25:47.405
It's eight miles to the nearest village.

01:25:47.687 --> 01:25:51.760
I don't expect to see you
when I wake up. Goodnight.

01:26:00.646 --> 01:26:01.762
What the hell were you thinking?!

01:26:01.926 --> 01:26:02.757
About the plant?

01:26:02.846 --> 01:26:04.326
About me, you idiot!

01:26:07.086 --> 01:26:08.042
Here's the thing.

01:26:09.006 --> 01:26:11.056
You go to some dark
places when you write.

01:26:12.766 --> 01:26:14.836
You bring out stuff most
people prefer to keep locked up.

01:26:14.925 --> 01:26:16.439
So I thought that if
I made you miserable...

01:26:16.485 --> 01:26:18.185
...I'd be able to finish my novel.

01:26:18.205 --> 01:26:19.639
Well that's genius.

01:26:19.685 --> 01:26:20.482
Yeah well I was wrong.

01:26:20.525 --> 01:26:21.402
Of course you were wrong.

01:26:21.485 --> 01:26:24.985
You don't have to be miserable to
write. You do it because you have to.

01:26:25.005 --> 01:26:28.055
Because it gnaws away at your
insides if you try to ignore it.

01:26:28.805 --> 01:26:31.655
Because if you don't write
then you might as well be dead.

01:26:32.805 --> 01:26:35.955
What do you mean, you were wrong?
You got the novel, didn't you?

01:26:36.005 --> 01:26:37.836
In Tom and Roddy-world the
plan was a roaring success.

01:26:37.924 --> 01:26:38.755
Not exactly.

01:26:40.324 --> 01:26:42.122
The last chapter. It doesn't work.

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:44.434
It needs a rewrite.

01:26:47.324 --> 01:26:48.155
How much of it?

01:26:48.604 --> 01:26:49.401
All of it.

01:26:55.924 --> 01:26:56.755
You all right?

01:26:58.404 --> 01:27:01.202
No. I'm bloody not all right
and I want my chocolate.

01:27:05.923 --> 01:27:09.633
Maybe it would help if we talked it through.

01:27:11.923 --> 01:27:12.873
What have I missed?

01:27:18.803 --> 01:27:23.081
I think the problem might be that you
don't really get to choose your ending.

01:27:23.162 --> 01:27:27.236
It has to follow naturally from what
comes before, or it doesn't feel true.

01:27:27.322 --> 01:27:28.233
Oh he's so insightful.

01:27:28.402 --> 01:27:29.802
I want to start with Darsie.

01:27:30.082 --> 01:27:30.913
Goody.

01:27:31.002 --> 01:27:31.799
I don't understand her.

01:27:31.922 --> 01:27:32.719
No kidding.

01:27:32.762 --> 01:27:36.915
I mean, why's she in love with a man
who betrays her so utterly?

01:27:37.562 --> 01:27:38.862
He's emotionally crippled,

01:27:39.042 --> 01:27:41.602
has an uncomfortable
tendency for mean-spiritedness...

01:27:41.682 --> 01:27:44.356
He has nice... hair.

01:27:50.881 --> 01:27:54.477
Okay, so yes, maybe there
is an element of autobiography.

01:27:55.481 --> 01:27:56.801
Which means you're
the reason I can't write.

01:27:56.841 --> 01:27:57.672
Me?

01:27:57.761 --> 01:28:00.861
At some point during the last
few weeks it dawned on me that...

01:28:01.561 --> 01:28:03.473
...when I finished this
novel, we were finished too.

01:28:03.921 --> 01:28:07.278
And some insane part of me
doesn't want that to happen.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:11.235
You're my block, Tom.

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.794
But I want you to finish it.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.993
Yeah of course you want me to finish it,
but for what? So you can turn a profit.

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:16.991
I've sold it.

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.111
What?

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:22.355
I've sold the business.

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:27.073
No, you can't have sold it.
That stupid company is you.

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.357
Get it back. You can't do this to me.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.770
I'm on the moral high ground
here and I'm not getting off now.

01:28:38.359 --> 01:28:39.156
You sold it?

01:28:39.359 --> 01:28:40.270
Yeah.

01:28:47.079 --> 01:28:48.638
And you can take all
the time you need...

01:28:48.759 --> 01:28:51.309
...for the last chapter.
I made it part of the deal.

01:28:53.199 --> 01:28:56.987
Tom. I didn't sign.

01:28:58.958 --> 01:29:00.870
With Klinsch and McLeish. I couldn't do it.

01:29:01.038 --> 01:29:02.995
Jane, I've spoken to my
Relationship Manager...

01:29:03.078 --> 01:29:06.428
If I hear the words 'sad', 'beautiful'
or 'music' you're a dead man.

01:29:07.038 --> 01:29:07.835
Apparently...

01:29:09.958 --> 01:29:10.755
I block you.

01:29:11.718 --> 01:29:12.834
And I block you too.

01:29:20.637 --> 01:29:22.993
What? What could possibly be more important?

01:29:24.317 --> 01:29:27.071
I know how it ends.
I'm just going to get my laptop.

01:29:28.957 --> 01:29:29.834
I don't care.

01:29:38.997 --> 01:29:40.829
You are on fire.

01:29:41.076 --> 01:29:42.726
You're pretty hot yourself, baby.

01:29:47.396 --> 01:29:52.994
Err, Tom? Tom, what are
you doing? Tom? Oh my God. Tom!

01:29:59.356 --> 01:30:00.233
Tom?

01:30:01.556 --> 01:30:02.353
Tom!

01:30:08.515 --> 01:30:12.304
Why is it that the saddest
endings always seem the truest?

01:30:12.955 --> 01:30:16.073
In the stories I told myself
I was always the heroine...

01:30:16.155 --> 01:30:18.226
...always reaching for my happy ending.

01:30:22.315 --> 01:30:23.715
It didn't turn out that way.

01:30:25.115 --> 01:30:27.565
I won't get to spend
the rest of my life with him.

01:30:29.114 --> 01:30:33.154
But I was loved. And that's enough.

01:30:45.754 --> 01:30:46.949
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:30:47.834 --> 01:30:51.509
Jane Lockhart will now be signing
copies of her chart-topping new novel...

01:30:52.513 --> 01:30:53.813
'You'll Catch Your Death'.

01:31:08.233 --> 01:31:10.350
Well, Darsie. Back where you belong.

01:31:10.513 --> 01:31:12.413
Are you actually talking to your book?

01:31:14.112 --> 01:31:15.341
You don't think it's all a bit tacky?

01:31:15.672 --> 01:31:17.106
Tacky? We have canapes.

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:18.783
Now get signing.

01:31:24.552 --> 01:31:29.149
Right, you ready? Go on, just do it.
Okay, pay attention class, pay attention!

01:31:33.312 --> 01:31:35.668
Jane Lockhart, of course...

01:31:36.312 --> 01:31:40.146
...follows Charlotte Bronte
as only the second writer...

01:31:40.231 --> 01:31:43.747
...in English to design and
build her own hovercraft.

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:45.151
Hovercraft.

01:31:45.511 --> 01:31:48.470
H.O.V.E.R.C.R.A.F.T.

01:31:49.311 --> 01:31:52.031
See? They'll believe
anything you tell them.

01:31:55.271 --> 01:32:00.470
So, I thought you said Pandemic
Media people were coming today.

01:32:01.710 --> 01:32:02.587
Where are they?

01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.787
You're looking at them.

01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.880
What do you mean?

01:32:05.630 --> 01:32:07.462
They want someone in
the company who won't...

01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:09.990
...let you get away with
your usual extravagance.

01:32:10.110 --> 01:32:11.624
Someone hard-line.

01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:13.503
Someone disciplined.

01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:18.783
Ah, brilliant.

01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:21.210
Cheers, thank you.

01:32:25.149 --> 01:32:25.946
You read it.

01:32:26.349 --> 01:32:29.945
Yeah. Her father was really bad to her.

01:32:30.509 --> 01:32:31.609
A nasty piece of work.

01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:33.529
- No. No, no, he wasn't nas...
- But...

01:32:34.909 --> 01:32:36.309
She forgives him in the end.

01:32:43.309 --> 01:32:46.460
Mr L. Oh...

01:32:46.508 --> 01:32:47.828
...if you think that was bad...

01:32:47.908 --> 01:32:50.858
...wait til you see what she's
done with you in the new one.

01:32:55.388 --> 01:32:56.583
Yeah. Errm...

01:32:58.028 --> 01:33:01.146
Mr Lockhart, Benny, would
you give us a second?

01:33:03.828 --> 01:33:04.659
Yeah, yeah sure.

01:33:05.068 --> 01:33:05.899
Thanks.

01:33:21.467 --> 01:33:22.617
- So...
- Uh-huh?

01:33:24.867 --> 01:33:25.857
- Look...
- Yes?

01:33:26.027 --> 01:33:29.737
You are, frankly, about the most
infuriating person I've ever met.

01:33:30.187 --> 01:33:33.657
Which considering I work in Scottish
publishing, is saying something.

01:33:36.866 --> 01:33:39.266
But we couldn't have got
here without each other.

01:33:42.106 --> 01:33:43.606
So Jane, what I'm saying is...

01:33:45.066 --> 01:33:45.863
Will you...

01:33:48.426 --> 01:33:49.257
Could you...

01:33:50.186 --> 01:33:51.136
Is that a contract?

01:33:51.186 --> 01:33:53.186
Two more books and
an option for a third.

01:33:53.786 --> 01:33:54.583
Exclusive?

01:33:54.666 --> 01:33:57.134
Naturally we'd have to work
very, very, very closely.

01:33:57.265 --> 01:33:58.585
With lots of notes?

01:33:58.665 --> 01:34:00.179
An excessive amount of notes.

01:34:00.225 --> 01:34:01.056
Okay, I do.

01:34:03.185 --> 01:34:04.938
I mean.. I mean I will.

01:34:05.945 --> 01:34:06.845
I will, I meant...

01:34:08.665 --> 01:34:09.865
Okay, just give it here.

01:36:55.258 --> 01:36:57.932
This is really pathetic.

01:36:58.378 --> 01:37:01.051
Who is this? Jimmy Miller.

01:37:01.737 --> 01:37:03.091
Should I know him?

01:37:05.097 --> 01:37:07.851
One hundred pages of the
bullshit. One hundred pages.

01:37:09.097 --> 01:37:10.647
I'm not even going to read his.

01:37:11.137 --> 01:37:15.290
Caitlin doesn't turn up most of the time.
Hasn't even put his name on the front cover.

01:37:15.337 --> 01:37:16.537
Who is this meant to be?

01:37:16.657 --> 01:37:18.967

01:37:19.057 --> 01:37:22.653

and I'll know what he's trying to say,

01:37:22.776 --> 01:37:26.776
he's got another thing coming. They're
all the same, aren't they? Shona Westwood.

01:37:27.296 --> 01:37:31.688
What does she want? There's nothing in this,
