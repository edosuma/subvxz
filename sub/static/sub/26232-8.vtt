[series theme music playing]

00:28.695 --> 00:30.697
[people chattering]

00:41.667 --> 00:42.584
[TJ] No straws.

00:42.668 --> 00:43.627
Can you believe it?

00:43.794 --> 00:45.796
-[music playing]
-[people chattering]

00:46.838 --> 00:49.841
-What kind of bar doesn't have straws?
-I don't know, Caruso.

00:50.467 --> 00:53.011
I was at the Nautilaus Diner last night;
straws on every table.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.179
Individually wrapped.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.266
It's not just me. Everybody loves them.

00:57.349 --> 01:00.227
They're better for you,
they're more efficient. Ask any doctor.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.397
Plus, it creates a vacuum,
so you're not inhaling any air.

01:04.898 --> 01:05.732
Also...

01:06.233 --> 01:08.944
the sucking motion is calming,
that's why babies do it.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.153
[Cora] Mhm.

01:12.656 --> 01:13.490
Am I boring you?

01:14.032 --> 01:16.034
No, no, I wish you were.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.829
-I passed bored 20 minutes ago.
-Okay, fine.

01:19.705 --> 01:20.539
Fine.

01:20.998 --> 01:21.873
How was your day?

01:22.332 --> 01:23.208
How was your run?

01:24.835 --> 01:26.753
I saw your dad on Whitmore Drive.

01:27.129 --> 01:30.549
Every Monday and Friday, rain or shine.
I guess it beats therapy.

01:30.966 --> 01:34.052
If I died on some street corner, tomorrow,

01:35.554 --> 01:38.223
who would bring flowers,
and sit there, and remember me?

01:38.307 --> 01:39.141
Nobody.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.352
-I would.
-You don't count.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.106
No, I'm sorry. Of course you count.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.608
I mean family.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.234
I'm alone out here.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.444
That can't be true.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.487
I have no one.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.949
I'm the girl who works Thanksgiving
and Christmas, remember?

01:56.033 --> 01:57.576
I'm already dreading Easter.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.747
At least you know your father,
I never had the pleasure, or displeasure.

02:02.539 --> 02:05.500
He disappeared when I was two,
probably back to Guadalajara.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.588
Three years later my mom died.
Thanks, Mom.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.007
It's just been me and my stepfather,

02:12.090 --> 02:14.426
who hasn't been this side of sober
in 20 years.

02:15.802 --> 02:16.803
I'm sorry.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.557
How's this for sorry?

02:23.602 --> 02:24.561
I hired her.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.191
-A genealogist?
-She's already working on it.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.319
She's checking birth records,
digging up my family tree.

02:32.778 --> 02:36.281
Maybe there's someone out there.
A long-lost uncle, a...

02:37.449 --> 02:40.911
-half sister, twice removed?
-Yeah, well, careful what you wish for.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.038
I'm almost 30, Caruso.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.790
I'm tired of being careful
what I wish for.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.167
Excuse me everybody.
Excuse me.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.337
Does anybody belong to
the orange Mustang out front?

02:51.088 --> 02:51.963
What happened?

02:52.464 --> 02:55.717
Okay, let me start off by saying
that it's not as bad as it looks.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.803
It's always as bad as it looks.
What happened?

02:57.886 --> 02:59.346
I'm sorry, you're down a headlight.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.224
Hell, I can't believe it.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.267
Be right back.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.689
Hey, man.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.818
Here's my card and my insurance.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.863
-Should we call the police?
-That won't be necessary.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.825
That's Detective Cora Vasquez,
All-City Homicide.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.328
-You a cop?
-Not your lucky day, is it?

03:24.663 --> 03:25.539
You're not a cop.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.916
-Pretty sure I am.
-No way you're a cop.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.168
-How would you know?
-Because I've seen cops.

03:30.252 --> 03:33.130
-Although it would explain a lot.
-Explain what?

03:33.213 --> 03:36.800
The high crime rate in New York.
I get that now, guys want to meet cops.

03:37.259 --> 03:39.010
[both laugh]

03:39.094 --> 03:39.970
Okay.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.304
You're smooth.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.390
Yeah, I have my moments.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.101
If only you parked as good as you talked.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.272
Warren Hanney.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.774
Club Vista.
Is that the new gym in Tribeca?

03:53.233 --> 03:56.069
Yes, we're supposed to open next month
if my contractor gets it together.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.947
If you are interested in joining,

04:00.490 --> 04:02.701
I know a guy that can
work on giving you a discount.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.870
[both chuckle]

04:04.995 --> 04:07.164
-You owe me a lot more than a discount.
-Ok, look.

04:07.289 --> 04:10.500
Ok, sorry, excuse me a sec.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.711
That's an infraction...

04:13.295 --> 04:14.796
because she is a city employee,

04:14.880 --> 04:17.549
so she can't be accepting
goods and services.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.594
Be cool, man.

04:23.096 --> 04:23.930
I'm cool.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.640
Okay.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.267
Then be cooler.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.402
[TJ] It's been two weeks.
She's showing up late to work,

04:37.486 --> 04:38.945
she's not answering her calls.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.448
She's obviously into the guy.
Which, you know what, fine.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.659
Good for her. I'm happy for her.
I'm happy for both of them.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.827
[music playing]

04:45.911 --> 04:46.953
Happy for everyone.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.873
It's my own fault, you know.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.667
I never told her how I feel,
but here's the thing.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.003
What if I don't really feel the way
I'm feeling, what if...

04:55.378 --> 04:56.880
What if I'm fooling myself.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.883
Also, I'm her boss so,
you know, there's that.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.386
[TJ laughs] You weren't there.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.597
You weren't there, Dad.
You didn't meet him.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.309
There's something about the guy,
with his snappy comebacks.

05:09.726 --> 05:10.769
"Be cooler."

05:11.728 --> 05:12.771
Who talks like that?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.731
That's not conversation,
that's just banter.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.108
You can't build a serious relationship
on banter.

05:18.819 --> 05:19.736
What are you watching?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.947
[music playing]

05:24.491 --> 05:25.534
A cat video.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.910
Her name was Cleo.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.121
She died last week,
family posted a video.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.623
Did you know the family?

05:31.832 --> 05:32.707
No.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.084
Did you know the cat?

05:34.376 --> 05:35.210
No.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.673
Well...

05:40.507 --> 05:41.675
enjoy your retirement.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.176
Catch you tonight.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.198
[both chuckling]

06:06.283 --> 06:07.117
Okay, go.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.285
No, I can't go.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.288
They're your friends.
We can't spend every minute together.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.456
I can't do it.
I don't think I can play poker tonight.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.334
-I don't think I'll ever play poker again.
-Oh yeah? Why not?

06:16.418 --> 06:17.252
Because...

06:18.420 --> 06:20.005
Because, Cora Vasquez,

06:20.797 --> 06:24.301
two weeks ago when I hit your car
and I met you, I used up all my luck.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.220
A lifetime's worth of luck.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.897
Don't lie to me, Warren.

06:36.980 --> 06:40.483
If you lie to a cop,
they never believe you again.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.777
Does it feel like I'm lying to you?

06:48.909 --> 06:49.784
Yeah.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.163
Okay, that's a first.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.582
My roommate Denny
left the door wide open.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.625
Den!

06:57.417 --> 07:00.170
Hello, you left the door
wide open man,

07:00.253 --> 07:03.465
which is hilarious, because you're always
giving me grief about buzzing people in.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.223
What the hell happened?

07:12.307 --> 07:13.892
Warren, don't touch anything.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.704
[Warren sniffs]

07:42.379 --> 07:44.214
[Warren pants] Is he dead?

07:45.340 --> 07:48.760
Cora, is he dead?
You have to tell me, it's my apartment.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.178
Not anymore.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.930
It's my crime scene.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.724
[police radio]

07:54.849 --> 07:58.269
[Cora] Tell Kornbluth front of the line.
I want that autopsy tonight.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.817
Caruso, thank you for coming.

08:03.900 --> 08:04.776
Are you ok?

08:05.276 --> 08:06.152
That's a dress.

08:06.736 --> 08:07.988
Yes, I'm wearing a dress.

08:08.822 --> 08:09.656
Where's Warren?

08:10.073 --> 08:12.033
I released him. He's with some friends.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.618
Don't worry, I got his statement.

08:14.869 --> 08:15.870
They were roommates?

08:16.121 --> 08:17.539
Yeah, Dennis Trott.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.250
Nice guy, quiet, kind of serious.

08:20.750 --> 08:21.584
You met him?

08:22.210 --> 08:24.170
Last week, at breakfast.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.965
Breakfast? Of course.

08:27.048 --> 08:30.510
That makes sense,
you were here, in the morning so...

08:30.593 --> 08:31.428
you would...

08:31.553 --> 08:33.513
Yeah, you would have had breakfast.
It makes sense.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.432
Are you okay?

08:35.640 --> 08:36.766
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:37.892 --> 08:38.893
Is there a problem?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.062
-Between us?
-No no, no no, no, no.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.063
No, we're cool.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.232
We are cool. [bitterness laughter]

08:49.571 --> 08:50.447
Yes, we are cool.

08:51.114 --> 08:51.948
Good.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.284
I've been connecting the dots.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.786
The perp comes up the fire escape,

08:56.995 --> 08:58.955
breaks the window, forces the lock.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.123
He's tossing the place,

09:00.206 --> 09:02.625
Denny's in the shower,
maybe he hears something.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.253
"Hello, who's there?"
Wrong place, wrong time.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.380
-You talk to the DA?
-Done.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.216
There's an ATM across the street.
We could prob--

09:10.300 --> 09:11.676
Surveillance video, I've pulled it.

09:12.594 --> 09:16.264
-Have you started a casebook?
-It's on the table in the breakfast nook.

09:16.765 --> 09:17.724
Breakfast nook.

09:19.684 --> 09:20.518
Are you okay?

09:20.602 --> 09:21.811
I said breakfast again.

09:21.895 --> 09:22.896
Yeah, no, I'm good.

09:23.021 --> 09:23.897
-Yeah?
-Good.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.608
Nook.

09:26.983 --> 09:27.901
Okay.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.987
Alright, I think this one's in the bag.
Exhibit A.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.490
Look at those prints.

09:33.990 --> 09:34.908
Four fingers.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.286
-That's pretty clean.
-Broderick said it's picture perfect.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.955
A murder weapon
with four perfect prints.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.540
All we need is a name to go with them.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.500
Stax.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.751
Excuse me?

09:45.794 --> 09:48.254
That's our suspect.
Warren told me about a guy named Stax.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.841
He hangs out in the park.
He wears a Stax Records hat,

09:52.258 --> 09:53.218
hence the nickname.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.385
Okay.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.346
Warren and Denny sort of adopted him.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.808
They started bringing leftovers
every night, spare change...

09:59.891 --> 10:01.518
What makes you think that he's,

10:01.810 --> 10:02.644
you know.

10:02.727 --> 10:03.895
Hey, Frank?

10:04.729 --> 10:05.563
Yeah.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.023
Thank you.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.942
This was on the fire escape.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.485
It's his hat.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.112
That's fortuitous.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.699
Caruso, we've got to find this guy.
Warren wanted to stay in tonight.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.201
I talked him into going out.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.662
If he had been here...

10:20.787 --> 10:23.248
No, look, I get it.
It should have been him.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.625
Should have been him?

10:26.084 --> 10:28.294
It could have been him.
I said it could have.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.546
You said "should."

10:29.629 --> 10:31.297
Could... could.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.257
I said could.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.425
-I'm standing here.
-I'm five inches from your face.

10:34.509 --> 10:37.303
Well, I am closer to
my face than you are.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.055
My face is right here.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.057
I am... my face.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.183
So...

10:44.894 --> 10:46.396
Maybe you're right, I don't know.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.023
-Hey!
-[TJ sighs]

10:50.108 --> 10:51.192
Are you on my side?

10:51.776 --> 10:52.819
You know I am.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.487
Then be happy for me.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.656
Warren's one of the good guys.

10:59.951 --> 11:00.827
He better be.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.036
Caruso, come here.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.416
[music playing]

11:23.266 --> 11:25.185
Okay.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.813
You pack a punch.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.940
[chuckles]

11:33.484 --> 11:34.485
Don't you forget it.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.822
-[Warren chuckles] Who is it?
-Who's what?

11:38.156 --> 11:39.365
The old-timers say,

11:39.657 --> 11:41.367
that you should imagine the bag

11:41.451 --> 11:43.369
is somebody that screwed you over.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.997
In that case,
we're going to be here a while.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.250
Joey Garrity, 11th grade.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.252
My first boss.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.963
My ex-fiance,

11:55.089 --> 11:57.759
my other ex-fiance,

11:59.260 --> 12:00.428
and my stepfather.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.059
-Who is that?
-Stax.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.023
Stax.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.031
How's that going?

12:20.782 --> 12:21.741
Any luck?

12:23.368 --> 12:24.535
He's off the grid.

12:24.619 --> 12:27.664
But we will find him. TJ's on it.
He's the best cop in the city.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.082
The guy from the bar?

12:29.165 --> 12:30.250
Mr. Infraction?

12:31.459 --> 12:33.253
That guy is into you, I could tell.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.797
He got me the gig, he...

12:36.547 --> 12:38.049
he feels responsible.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.009
He feels a lot more than that.

12:40.885 --> 12:41.719
But...

12:41.886 --> 12:43.137
I can't blame that guy.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.685
I met Denny's parents today.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.521
They flew in to claim the body.

12:56.025 --> 12:56.859
Thank you.

12:58.444 --> 12:59.279
For what?

12:59.362 --> 13:00.321
For being here.

13:00.989 --> 13:01.990
Not just...

13:03.032 --> 13:04.701
here, it's just...

13:05.827 --> 13:06.786
in my life.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.164
I don't think I'd get through this
without you.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.212
That's my job.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.006
Protect and serve.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.592
[music playing]

13:27.432 --> 13:28.391
That's a nice cat.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.685
Thank you for sharing that.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.604
-Watch it again.
-I don't have to watch it again.

13:33.896 --> 13:34.981
Tony, I have a question,

13:35.064 --> 13:36.733
and I don't want you to get angry, but...

13:36.816 --> 13:39.277
have you suffered
a severe concussion recently,

13:39.360 --> 13:41.321
or maybe
some kind of industrial accident?

13:41.571 --> 13:43.364
Wendell, I'm fine.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.490
I never felt better.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.828
I installed a computer program
that scans the internet

13:49.162 --> 13:50.830
for news items and videos

13:50.955 --> 13:53.708
from a specific location
on a specific day.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.961
-A specific day?
-Yeah, November 20th.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.173
Sunset Park, four years ago.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.008
Connie.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.010
Yeah, yeah.
Watch it again.

14:08.473 --> 14:09.307
There.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.434
Not the cat, on the street.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.229
-A yellow van.
-Yeah. Now check the time stamp.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.607
That's four minutes after
Connie was killed.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.317
And this is two blocks away.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.526
And then look.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.196
What's he's doing,
70 - 75 on a residential street?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.907
I'm telling you, after four years,
that's the guy.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.035
Dragged her 50 feet, he never slowed down.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.747
What's Junior say?

14:33.247 --> 14:34.791
-I'm not telling Junior.
-Why not?

14:36.292 --> 14:37.835
-You know why not.
-I do?

14:38.086 --> 14:39.295
-We both do.
-We do?

14:39.879 --> 14:40.797
Just remind me.

14:42.507 --> 14:43.674
I'm going to kill him.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.178
Now...

14:47.261 --> 14:49.347
I can only make out
three numbers on the plate,

14:49.430 --> 14:50.890
that's not enough to trace him.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.518
-I've got to get into the DMV database.
-Database.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.645
Yeah, only problem is, I...

14:56.145 --> 14:57.939
I can't get near the squad room.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.650
I can't even call them.
I've been banned for life.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.236
I can't help but wonder,

15:04.445 --> 15:06.114
why are you telling me all this?

15:08.741 --> 15:09.992
Something's not tracking.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.412
No prints anywhere except the knife?

15:12.495 --> 15:13.746
He wiped the place down.

15:14.414 --> 15:18.126
Everywhere except the murder weapon?
You'd think he'd start with the knife.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.502
And look at this.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.421
[policemen chattering]

15:21.546 --> 15:22.588
This is a Rolex.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.341
This is a $4,000 watch.
How could he have missed it?

15:25.716 --> 15:28.344
Maybe he panicked?
Maybe he was interrupted?

15:29.595 --> 15:31.139
-[police siren]
-[Burl sighs]

15:31.514 --> 15:32.515
What are you doing?

15:32.890 --> 15:35.017
Sometimes there's blood splatter
on the ceiling.

15:35.977 --> 15:36.811
Any luck?

15:37.645 --> 15:38.604
Nothing yet.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.274
You know, I was thinking...

15:41.441 --> 15:43.943
there might be some blood splatter
on the inside of your eyelids.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.362
You're the boss, I'll check it out.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.156
What else you got?

15:49.699 --> 15:50.658
Blood on the floor.

15:51.033 --> 15:51.868
What about it?

15:52.702 --> 15:54.078
Well it's under the glass.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.747
If he smashed the window

15:56.831 --> 15:58.749
when he was coming in
and killed his roommate,

15:59.959 --> 16:01.627
don't you think the blood would be on top?

16:01.878 --> 16:03.337
You think it's a setup?

16:04.213 --> 16:05.047
Feels like it.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.550
You think it's a setup
or you hope it's a setup?

16:13.389 --> 16:15.641
[Wendell] Ryan, over here, over here.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.060
-[people chattering]
-[music playing]

16:19.020 --> 16:20.104
Did you get the list?

16:20.521 --> 16:21.981
It's 74 names.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.817
I didn't know the model of the van,
all you gave me was the color.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.194
It's perfect.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.112
I'll take it from here.
Thank you.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.615
He was a customer
from the barbershop?

16:31.407 --> 16:32.241
That's right.

16:32.909 --> 16:33.743
It's funny.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.454
You can remember three numbers
from his license plate,

16:36.537 --> 16:37.955
but you can't remember his name?

16:38.039 --> 16:40.208
Yeah, you know,
that's how it works sometimes.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.835
The human brain is a funny animal.
[laughs]

16:43.294 --> 16:45.838
And he has a thousand comic books?

16:45.922 --> 16:48.132
That's what he said.
I think maybe even more.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.176
Yeah, so thank you very much.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.761
Does he have...

16:51.844 --> 16:55.097
Fantastic Four #48,
the first appearance of the Silver Surfer?

16:55.348 --> 16:56.349
The Silver Surfer?

16:57.350 --> 16:58.851
I think so, yeah.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.229
Hey, you know what?
We'll find out soon enough.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.105
Look, I gotta go back to work, alright?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.482
Remember, mum's the word.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.608
What's the word?

17:07.276 --> 17:08.444
Mum is the word.

17:08.778 --> 17:09.946
-Mum.
-Mum.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.781
-Mum is the word.
-Mum's the word.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.534
-Mum's the word.
-Concerning this, mum's the word.

17:14.617 --> 17:15.451
Mum.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.204
I don't have time for this anymore.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.332
Why would "mum" be the word?

17:26.837 --> 17:27.672
Cora?

17:27.964 --> 17:29.966
-[policemen chattering]
-[phone ringing]

17:32.885 --> 17:33.719
What did he do?

17:34.345 --> 17:35.429
-Who?
-Warren.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.266
I hate to say it, but I'm not surprised.

17:39.016 --> 17:42.061
Burl and I, we went back to his apartment.
There were too many inconsistencies.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.855
-We didn't want to--
-Okay, this is not about Warren.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.440
Okay?

17:48.609 --> 17:49.652
Good, good.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.946
You remember that genealogist I hired?

17:52.488 --> 17:53.447
That's her report.

17:54.156 --> 17:54.991
I'm an orphan.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.369
I thought I might have
some cousins in Mexico,

17:58.452 --> 18:00.621
maybe someone on my Italian side.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.207
[laughs] They're all deceased or MIA.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.375
I have no one.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.253
You always have us.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.923
One... big...

18:11.591 --> 18:12.883
dysfunctional family.

18:13.718 --> 18:14.594
Thank you.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.644
Cora, hey.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.063
-Hey.
-Hi, baby.

18:26.147 --> 18:26.981
Hi.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.025
[both moan]

18:33.988 --> 18:35.698
Hey, "Infraction", how's it going?

18:37.366 --> 18:39.452
I got your message, what happened?

18:41.203 --> 18:42.038
This.

18:44.498 --> 18:46.542
Okay. What's it mean?

18:47.168 --> 18:48.753
It means I don't have a family.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.256
Well, let's do something about that.

18:53.674 --> 18:54.508
What?

18:56.218 --> 18:57.178
Can I use this office?

18:57.511 --> 18:58.471
Yes.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.307
Thanks. Come with me.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.309
-[phone ringing]
-[policemen chattering]

19:14.070 --> 19:15.488
Maybe he dropped something.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.202
Maybe he's...

19:22.119 --> 19:23.037
looking for it.

19:24.622 --> 19:27.458
Why isn't she helping him... look for it?

19:28.959 --> 19:30.961
[women gasp and yell]

19:32.380 --> 19:33.214
Oh, no.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.633
[police officers applauding]

19:39.512 --> 19:41.180
[woman shouting] Congratulations!

19:42.973 --> 19:44.975
[everybody congratulates them]

19:46.185 --> 19:48.104
[Warren] Thank you very much.

19:48.479 --> 19:49.980
[Warren] I'll see you later, babe.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.108
[Warren] Thank you very much.
We appreciate that.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.287
There you are.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.542
At least we know
the steam room's working.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.086
[Warren chuckles] Look at you.

20:17.341 --> 20:20.177
I cannot believe
I get to marry this woman

20:20.594 --> 20:21.971
Not yet, you don't.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.057
You gotta marry someone else first.

20:25.141 --> 20:28.310
No, no, no, I do not want
to talk about Cora.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.855
Not tonight, I haven't seen you in a week.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.732
We have to talk about Cora.

20:32.815 --> 20:35.025
I just got some news about her uncle.

20:35.109 --> 20:38.362
-Wait, wait, wait. Is he dead?
-No, not yet, but...

20:39.029 --> 20:39.905
he will be soon.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.574
He's in hospice in Mexico City.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.744
-[Warren grunts and laughs]
-[woman laughs]

20:44.952 --> 20:47.580
That's so good.
That is so good!

20:47.663 --> 20:50.708
Baby, everything is happening
exactly like you said it would.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.792
I knew it, though.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.545
You see, I knew the moment
you walked into my gym,

20:54.628 --> 20:57.465
You know we hit the jackpot,
right baby? We're going to celebrate.

20:57.548 --> 21:00.009
I've been saving a little something
special for the both of us.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.469
Can you believe that?

21:01.552 --> 21:03.471
Two hundred geneologists
in all of New York,

21:03.554 --> 21:04.555
and she calls you.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.641
And then you go and find
some long-lost uncle

21:07.725 --> 21:09.143
she's never even heard of.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.228
It's not that surprising,
she never knew her father.

21:11.312 --> 21:13.397
Yeah, but not just any uncle,

21:13.481 --> 21:15.232
an uncle worth $30 million dollars.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.652
-And even better, an uncle who is dying.
-[woman laughs]

21:18.736 --> 21:22.323
Cora Vasquez is about to inherit a fortune
and she doesn't even know it.

21:22.406 --> 21:26.702
But we will not see a nickel of that money
unless you marry the bitch.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.668
Yeah, here it is. Brett Kleyburg.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.171
Four years ago, stationed in Kuwait.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.173
Yeah, we can cross him off.
Who's next?

21:39.882 --> 21:40.716
Let's see.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.510
Joseph Privett.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.595
P, as in pneumonia.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.474
-Why would you, P as in what?
-Pneumonia.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.309
Now why would you say that?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.269
It's pneumonia.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.438
-It starts with a P.
-Yeah, but it's a silent P.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.524
-Doesn't matter, it's still there.
-But it's a...

21:57.358 --> 21:59.318
-What what about Pittsburgh?
-I don't want talk...

21:59.902 --> 22:02.988
-You want a piece of cheese?
-You know I've been eating cheese all day.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.241
Hey son, I thought you were sleeping?

22:05.324 --> 22:08.202
I know, Burl just called.
They picked up Stax in Union Square.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.497
He's our primary in the roommate murder.
The one Cora found in her...

22:11.580 --> 22:13.791
[takes a deep breath]
...fiance's apartment.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.544
Okay, yeah, be careful.

22:16.627 --> 22:17.586
Careful out there.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.171
Okay, come on.

22:20.381 --> 22:21.632
Privett, right?

22:22.299 --> 22:24.301
[Tony Sr. typing on pc.]

22:25.261 --> 22:27.096
There he is.
Look at that, Privett.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.807
Yeah, yeah, he was in Yonkers.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.351
A plumber, or used to be.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.436
There's nothing more recent.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.479
-Dad!
-Maybe--

22:35.563 --> 22:37.231
[both mumble]

22:37.356 --> 22:39.316
How about the Yankees?
What a line up--

22:39.400 --> 22:41.443
Dad, how long did you know Mom
before you proposed?

22:41.527 --> 22:42.570
Two years, son.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.906
That's what I thought. Thank you.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.623
-It's supposed to rain. [laughs]
-Ok, son.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.586
-We should lock that door.
-We should lock that door is right.

22:58.711 --> 22:59.879
Now wait a minute.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.380
Hold it, hold it.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.340
He was a plumber.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.217
He was a plumber.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.177
Give me the, give me, give me.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.263
Look, look on the truck.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.015
Is that a faucet?

23:11.098 --> 23:13.267
-It's a faucet on the truck.
-It's a faucet, yeah.

23:13.684 --> 23:14.935
Plumber's truck.

23:16.687 --> 23:19.106
-It wasn't me.
-Then why were you running?

23:19.690 --> 23:22.568
I heard you folks were setting me up,
I mean...

23:22.902 --> 23:23.986
you'd run too.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.487
Not me, I don't run.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.241
I was looking for that.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.160
I lost it last week.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.871
[TJ] It was only the fire escape,

23:34.079 --> 23:35.289
thirty feet from the body.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.292
I can't help you, [stammers]
I wish I could.

23:39.627 --> 23:40.836
And there's this.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.381
See those prints?

23:46.717 --> 23:47.635
Clear as day.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.012
Best prints we've ever seen.

23:50.554 --> 23:51.680
They belong to you.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.433
Like I said, I can't help you.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.565
You know these boys?

24:06.820 --> 24:07.780
From the park.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.323
-You know their names?
-No.

24:09.406 --> 24:12.284
-You know where they live?
-No, sir, just the park.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.620
They're nice kids, we would talk.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.080
They bring me food.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.374
Sometimes they bring me stuff
from their apartment.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.375
What kind of stuff?

24:20.125 --> 24:22.544
This one, he gave me his umbrella.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.965
He's a nice kid. It wasn't even raining.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.926
-Excuse me?
-He gave me his umbrella.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.052
I mean he's a good kid.

24:38.727 --> 24:39.853
When was this?

24:39.937 --> 24:43.232
[stammers] A week ago Sunday?

24:44.191 --> 24:45.401
A week ago Sunday.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.278
It was a sunny day, why an umbrella?

24:48.570 --> 24:50.280
Here's all I know:
he had an umbrella,

24:50.364 --> 24:52.574
he said he didn't need it,
he said I could have it.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.953
-Where is it now?
-It's broken, it wouldn't open.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.580
So, he said he was sorry, he took it back.

24:59.665 --> 25:00.916
Let me get this straight.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.336
It's a sunny day, not a cloud in the sky.

25:05.129 --> 25:05.963
This man...

25:06.463 --> 25:08.882
-Warren Hanney, he has an umbrella.
-Yeah.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.426
-He gave the umbrella?
-Oh yeah.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.635
-But you can't open it.
-No.

25:11.719 --> 25:12.720
-It's broken.
-Yeah.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.389
He apologizes
and he takes the umbrella back?

25:15.556 --> 25:16.682
Exactly.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.270
Are those straws?

25:23.522 --> 25:24.356
Yes, they are.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.525
And you carry your own straws around

25:26.608 --> 25:28.694
because a lot of places
don't have them anymore?

25:29.486 --> 25:30.320
That's right.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.120
Great minds drink alike.

26:06.482 --> 26:07.316
I'm sorry.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.026
I'm sorry. I know, I know.

26:09.109 --> 26:09.943
You look familiar.

26:10.027 --> 26:12.237
You look like a detective
who used to work here.

26:12.321 --> 26:13.155
Cora something.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.240
This week has been insane.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.492
What are these?

26:16.575 --> 26:19.328
These are invitations.
One for you and one for your dad.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.747
I know it's last-minute,
I just ran them off downstairs.

26:22.498 --> 26:24.541
This is department stationary,

26:24.625 --> 26:26.043
it's an infraction.

26:26.335 --> 26:29.379
That's the theme of my wedding:
"Infractions I Have Committed."

26:29.755 --> 26:31.799
This doesn't have a date on it.
It just say's 4 p.m.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.133
It's today.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.719
Four o'clock at City Hall.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.388
-You're getting married today?
-Yeah.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.101
Don't you want to live with the guy
for a couple hours first,

26:42.184 --> 26:43.435
you know, to make sure?

26:44.311 --> 26:46.647
We're just signing the papers today
to make it legal.

26:47.022 --> 26:49.149
We'll have a big party in June
on the beach.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.734
Maybe Nantucket.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.612
Warren didn't want to wait.
Denny's murder really,

26:53.904 --> 26:55.906
really hit him hard, it changed his life.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.075
I bet it did.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.495
We picked up Stax.

27:02.037 --> 27:02.955
He just left.

27:03.372 --> 27:06.291
Well great, that's great news.
Did you get a confession?

27:07.793 --> 27:09.878
He denied everything, swore up and down.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.046
Said somebody set him up.

27:11.672 --> 27:14.550
Well we don't need a confession, do we?
I mean it's a slam dunk.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.510
We've got the hat,
prints on the knife...

27:17.553 --> 27:18.387
I believe him.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.347
You believe him?

27:20.722 --> 27:21.807
Who would set him up?

27:25.018 --> 27:26.562
Wait, wait...

27:29.606 --> 27:30.941
Are you looking at Warren?

27:32.609 --> 27:34.862
I tried to tell you, Cora.
You didn't want to listen.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.239
You think Warren killed his roommate,

27:37.447 --> 27:39.533
and then framed some vagrant?

27:39.616 --> 27:40.450
Why?

27:40.659 --> 27:41.660
I don't know.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.580
Forget why, how?

27:44.830 --> 27:46.915
Stax's fingerprints were on the knife.

27:47.749 --> 27:50.586
You and I went
to the same Forensics course.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.422
You can't transfer multiple fingerprints
onto a surface like that.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.548
It's not possible.

27:57.009 --> 27:57.843
Caruso...

28:01.013 --> 28:03.348
Did I lead you on in some way?

28:03.640 --> 28:05.058
This isn't personal, Cora.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.227
I'm following the evidence,
I'm just doing my job.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.771
Okay, because I don't need you
to protect me, or save me,

28:09.855 --> 28:12.024
or fix me, or take care of me.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.735
-Do you think this is fun for me?
-Yeah, I kinda do.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.865
Hey, I'm no Disney vacation,
I've been to town.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.576
-I understand.
-No, I don't think you do, but he does.

28:23.869 --> 28:27.080
Warren does. He's seen me ugly,
He's seen me crazy.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.708
He seen the worst of it,
and he still wants me.

28:31.960 --> 28:32.794
I love him.

28:34.129 --> 28:34.963
Don't.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.092
Don't what?

28:40.594 --> 28:41.511
Don't love him.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.728
It's a wedding gift.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.148
I don't need to look at that.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.362
I've seen cops fabricate cases before.

29:00.822 --> 29:01.865
Excuse me?

29:02.574 --> 29:04.701
I don't frame suspects, okay?
I don't railroad people.

29:04.826 --> 29:07.663
-Maybe you never had a reason to.
-I don't plant evidence.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.123
Maybe you're not thinking straight.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.668
Maybe it's in your blood.

29:17.047 --> 29:18.590
You know me better than that.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.635
At least I thought you did.

29:31.395 --> 29:32.604
Okay, show's over.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.160
CLUB VISTA

29:54.960 --> 29:56.128
[handle clicks]

30:10.100 --> 30:12.477
[lady] Adolf, Adolf! Stay.

30:12.686 --> 30:13.812
Adolf.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.982
Hi, I'm looking for Joseph Privett.

30:17.274 --> 30:18.525
-You're too late.
-[dog barking]

30:18.608 --> 30:20.193
You know when he'll be back?

30:20.444 --> 30:22.446
I mean three years too late.
He's dead.

30:22.612 --> 30:23.488
He's dead?

30:24.323 --> 30:25.824
Adolf, sit!

30:27.034 --> 30:28.327
Are you his wife?

30:28.452 --> 30:30.662
I'm just renting,
I moved in after he passed.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.372
Never saw him, never knew him.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.208
-Was he a plumber?
-I couldn't tell you.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.794
Did he drive a van? A yellow van?

30:37.878 --> 30:40.797
I wouldn't know.
Listen, I have to feed little Adolf.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.382
Yeah, he sounds hungry.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.969
That's not little Adolf, that's Adolf.

30:46.053 --> 30:47.596
Little Adolf's around back.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.855
-What did he do?
-It's just kind of a personal matter.

30:57.439 --> 30:58.440
It's sort of important.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.401
I think he might have some family.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.153
I might have a number somewhere.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.782
-How can I reach you?
-Yeah, hang on one second, I got my...

31:07.240 --> 31:08.408
Here's my...

31:08.617 --> 31:09.659
Here's my name,

31:10.369 --> 31:11.370
and my number.

31:12.662 --> 31:13.914
I really appreciate it.

31:15.082 --> 31:16.083
Thank you very much.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.793
Okay, Adolf, take care.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.711
Say hi to little Adolf and...

31:20.295 --> 31:21.546
all the other Adolfs.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.632
[dog continues barking]

31:32.599 --> 31:34.601
[Warren laughing]

31:35.644 --> 31:38.814
Hey, Infraction,
what an unpleasant surprise.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.441
Your front door was open.

31:42.484 --> 31:43.318
Yeah,

31:43.402 --> 31:45.654
I've been meaning to talk
to my foreman about that.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.697
I just stopped in to pay a couple bills,

31:47.781 --> 31:50.200
and then I am off to City Hall
to tie the knot.

31:50.283 --> 31:54.162
Or is it walk the plank? [laughs]

31:54.913 --> 31:56.415
I saw Cora this morning.

31:56.498 --> 31:57.999
Took your umbrella by mistake.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.459
That's okay, man.

31:59.543 --> 32:02.045
No big deal.
You didn't have to come all this way.

32:03.797 --> 32:05.340
You had your shot, man.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.011
-Excuse me?
-With Cora.

32:10.554 --> 32:12.597
You knew her first, you had your shot.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.683
You should have taken my advice, man.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.602
Be... cooler.

32:21.481 --> 32:22.816
There's a state prison...

32:23.316 --> 32:24.484
in Beekman, New York.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.611
It's called Green Haven Correctional.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.655
You're going to die there.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.326
That cool enough for you?

32:34.703 --> 32:36.079
What are you talking about?

32:36.830 --> 32:38.165
You killed your roommate.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.001
[sniffs] And you framed Stax for it.

32:42.127 --> 32:45.172
The handle's broken,
and it occurred to me...

32:46.006 --> 32:48.341
it's about the same size and shape
as the knife handle.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.720
-[Warren laughs]
-I'll bet that occurred to you, too.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.557
You replaced the umbrella handle
with the knife handle.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.396
You want to the park.

33:02.772 --> 33:04.858
You tricked that poor guy
into grabbing the handle.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.236
You had what you needed.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.032
Fingerprints on the murder weapon.

33:14.201 --> 33:15.827
The only thing I can't figure is...

33:16.912 --> 33:17.746
the motive.

33:19.748 --> 33:20.957
Wrong place, wrong time.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.752
You overheard me and Evelyn talking?

33:25.754 --> 33:26.588
Who's Evelyn?

33:29.633 --> 33:30.759
The genealogist?

33:30.842 --> 33:32.844
[Warren bangs TJ
and he thumps on the floor]

33:37.140 --> 33:39.351
-You have the right to remain...
-What's he saying?

33:41.770 --> 33:43.897
[TJ coughs]
You have the right to remain...

33:44.814 --> 33:47.609
He says that we have
the right to remain silent.

33:48.902 --> 33:51.196
Warren, you sign here.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.697
Cora, you can sign here.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.493
[Warren laughs]

33:56.576 --> 33:58.453
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

34:02.457 --> 34:03.333
Absolutely.

34:03.416 --> 34:06.836
I have never been more sure
of anything my entire life.

34:07.087 --> 34:07.963
Excuse me.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.464
Who's witnessing this?

34:09.798 --> 34:11.299
I was hoping TJ.

34:11.925 --> 34:13.552
Let's just give him another minute.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.762
-We're gonna give him another minute.
-He's not coming.

34:15.845 --> 34:17.389
Honey, you didn't see him.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.307
He's not thinking straight. He's...

34:20.016 --> 34:20.934
He's delusional.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.103
[steam-gass hisses]

34:31.194 --> 34:34.197
[grunts]

34:36.283 --> 34:38.285
[coughs]

34:38.535 --> 34:39.953
140°F

34:50.213 --> 34:51.506
Don't waste your breath,

34:52.549 --> 34:54.217
what little you have left of it.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.221
The glass is thick.

34:59.598 --> 35:00.515
Shatterproof.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.184
[Evelyn laughs]

35:14.237 --> 35:16.239
[coughs]

35:17.657 --> 35:19.659
[pants]

35:32.881 --> 35:35.091
You know, I don't normally brag,

35:35.175 --> 35:38.678
but it only took me, a day,
to find Cora's uncle.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.641
-Her what?
-Mateo Vasquez.

35:42.724 --> 35:45.018
Cora's long-lost Uncle from Mexico City.

35:45.685 --> 35:46.936
He died last night.

35:47.395 --> 35:50.065
Your friend, Cora,
is now worth 30 million dollars.

35:50.857 --> 35:54.069
It's such a shame
that she's not going to live to enjoy it.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.405
She's not even going to live
to know about it.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.867
I was about to say,
you may kiss the bride,

36:00.992 --> 36:02.702
but I see you're way ahead of me.

36:02.786 --> 36:04.788
[guests cheering and applauding]

36:05.664 --> 36:07.082
Hey, you guys got them something?

36:07.207 --> 36:09.376
Yeah, Ryan picked up something.
I'm chipping in.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.211
I don't even know what the hell it is.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.505
Yeah well I'm putting my name on the card.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.383
It's from all of us, okay?

36:16.466 --> 36:17.384
I'll chip in later.

36:17.467 --> 36:19.678
It was $90 Mr. C.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.554
I'm good for it, I'm in for a third.

36:21.638 --> 36:24.641
You still owe me from last week,
when I picked up your lunch.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.518
I'll pay you back, I'm good for it.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.478
Find a Bible, I'll swear on it.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.065
It's a figure of speech, Ryan.

36:32.148 --> 36:34.526
But wait, we gotta say goodbye.

36:34.859 --> 36:35.777
Of course, gents.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.445
Here, give me that.

36:37.779 --> 36:39.572
Hey... kids,

36:39.864 --> 36:42.492
it's just a little something
to get you guys started.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.494
It's not much, but it's from the heart.

36:45.161 --> 36:46.788
Thank you so much.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.164
Can I open it?

36:48.248 --> 36:49.416
Sure, go right ahead.

36:53.712 --> 36:54.921
It's a lava lamp.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.674
Well, we can cross that off our registry.

36:57.757 --> 36:59.384
I have the exact same model.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.011
It's gotten me through a lot of bad times.

37:02.303 --> 37:03.138
Horrible.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.682
Horrible, horrible times.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.600
Cora, Warren, the...

37:07.684 --> 37:12.021
the lava represents the...
you know, the cycle of endless love.

37:12.689 --> 37:15.233
A relationship that bubbles and...

37:15.859 --> 37:17.235
Ah hell, the kid bought it.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.028
-I ain't paying.
-Me neither.

37:36.212 --> 37:38.298
We're good. Ryan, we're good.

37:38.548 --> 37:40.508
Ryan, we're good. Thank you.

37:40.717 --> 37:41.885
Where you guys heading?

37:42.343 --> 37:44.929
You're looking at it.
The Crestview right across the street.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.015
You don't waste any time, do you?

Let me have one with mustard
and sauerkraut, please.

38:27.180 --> 38:28.556
[mobile phone ringing]

38:28.640 --> 38:29.474
Yeah, hello?

38:29.974 --> 38:30.850
[woman] <i>Tony Caruso?</i>

38:31.434 --> 38:33.102
-Speaking.
-This is Phyllis.

38:33.686 --> 38:36.564
You were at my house this morning
looking for Joe Privett.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.233
Yeah, hey Phyllis, what's up?

38:38.316 --> 38:40.777
I may have misrepresented myself.

38:41.736 --> 38:42.570
Joe, he's...

38:42.654 --> 38:43.780
<i>he's my old man.</i>

38:44.948 --> 38:46.491
<i>He was there when you were at the door,</i>

38:46.574 --> 38:47.575
<i>he heard everything.</i>

38:47.867 --> 38:49.869
-Wait, he was there?
-What did he do?

38:50.370 --> 38:52.247
He hurt somebody, somebody I loved.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.040
<i>I figured as much.</i>

38:54.290 --> 38:55.458
Yeah, well is he still there?

38:55.875 --> 38:58.878
No, he's on his way to the Port Authority.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.380
-Port Authority?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

39:00.922 --> 39:03.925
He's hopping a bus to some place,
and it's all I know.

39:04.717 --> 39:07.178
But, if you leave now,
maybe you can catch him.

39:07.303 --> 39:10.932
The only thing I have is a picture of him,
but it's like at least 20 years old.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.434
You can't miss him, he has a funny eye.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.813
-A funny eye? What does that mean?
-It gets all twitchy when he's scared,

39:16.896 --> 39:18.481
and believe me, you scared him.

39:18.940 --> 39:19.774
Listen,

39:20.400 --> 39:21.943
-I saw your gun.
-[sighs]

39:23.778 --> 39:24.654
If you find him,

39:28.825 --> 39:29.659
Use it.

<i>-Son, you're embarassing yourself.</i>

40:16.039 --> 40:17.498
Let it go, alright? Move on.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.584
She's not answering her phone.
Where is she?

40:19.667 --> 40:22.003
Across the street at the Crestview.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.463
Help me out here.

Well you have to stop them.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.093
Let's move on.
Anyway, I've got no time to talk.

40:31.721 --> 40:33.014
<i>Mine's more important.</i>

40:33.097 --> 40:35.850
Well, that can't be true
because on a scale from one to ten,

40:35.934 --> 40:37.769
-my things a ten.
-My things a 20.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.313
-My thing is a 25.

-Dad, listen.
-No, you listen to me.

40:45.068 --> 40:47.654
Listen, I've been waiting a long time

The wedding was a sham.

He's trying to kill her.
It's happening right now.

40:58.748 --> 40:59.832
This champagne...

What's in it?

41:02.710 --> 41:05.672
It won't hurt, I promise.
Just east into it, okay?

41:06.297 --> 41:07.757
No, no! [Cora gasps]

41:08.007 --> 41:10.510
I would never do this.
You don't know Evelyn.

-Evelyn, the genealogist?

41:15.890 --> 41:17.767
-Come on, Cora!
-You did it.

I'm good.

43:08.336 --> 43:09.212
How you doing?

43:09.587 --> 43:11.881
It's not exactly the honeymoon
I had planned.

43:14.425 --> 43:16.177
I'm more embarrassed than anything.

43:17.845 --> 43:18.679
Well...

43:19.430 --> 43:20.765
My mother used to say...

43:21.224 --> 43:22.642
no one ever died of embarrassment.

43:24.769 --> 43:25.603
I knew it.

I knew it.

when he was dragging me to the railing,

you know what I was thinking?

Of course.

It's hard to be wise and...
in love at the same time.

-Yeah.
-Okay.

It's for Cora.

I'd be drinking too.

It's not about the money.

Not a nickel.

before he died.
