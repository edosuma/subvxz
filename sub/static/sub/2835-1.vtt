11:22.000 --> 11:23.604
you could've emailed,
you could've sent a text.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.286
Yeah, but the damnedest thing,
none of my devices were working.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.726
So I figured I should just come

11:27.800 --> 11:29.165
and deliver
the message in person.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.611
(JORDAN CHUCKLING) Oh, hey.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.205
I changed my flight.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.124
So I can come
with you to Mia's.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.281
Oh. Great.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.646
But what about Vermont?

11:36.840 --> 11:37.887
The family understands.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.485
If it's important to you,
it's important to me.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.051
You guys want me
to wait outside?

11:41.120 --> 11:42.121
Shut up, Harper.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.850
Don't worry about it.
I got to get out of here.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.287
I only stopped by for a second.
All right, baby.

Bye.

Nice to meet you.
Absolutely.

11:52.800 --> 11:53.801
I guess I'll see
you this weekend?

JULIAN: The very last thing
has got me so excited.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.087
With smart boards in
each of the classrooms,

12:11.240 --> 12:13.208
our teachers compete
with anybody in the country.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.091
Julian, you don't have to sell me.
Your school is extraordinary.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.004
Well, that's because
of donations,

12:18.160 --> 12:20.367
from long-time contributors
like yourself, Elliot.

12:20.520 --> 12:24.491
And that's what makes
this even more difficult.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.491
Oh. How do you mean?
Well,

12:26.680 --> 12:29.001

Candace Sparks.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.725
Mmm-hmm.
She's your wife?

12:30.960 --> 12:32.610
Yes, she kept her maiden name.

And how did you meet again?

12:40.400 --> 12:42.004
I'm sorry.
What?

Yeah, no, I'll be right back!
Yep!

12:44.200 --> 12:46.726
Hey, how are you?
It's nice to see you.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.166

keep you, Mr. Stewart.

You promise?

Oh. Honey.

I'm sorry things didn't pan out

13:56.640 --> 13:58.130
the way you wanted
with your book,

13:58.640 --> 14:01.450
but the next
great idea will come.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.840
I know it.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.206
Stan thinks I should do
a biography on Lance.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.364
Really?
Yeah.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.803
That's interesting.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.770
So you think I should?

the first to arrive.

Baby, come on now,
you look amazing.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.051
I look like a cow.

Now, come on.

Or Uncle Harp,
or Auntie Rob-Rob, or...

call us that though.

messing with me.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.364
Yeah, but that
doesn't interest me.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.851
People only know what
I want them to know.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.844
Well, that's what they do. You
can't blame them, you're a star.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.048
Well, everybody's
got a job to do.

22:32.240 --> 22:33.924
As long as we stick to
football, we're straight.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.201
JORDAN: Hello, hello!

22:35.320 --> 22:36.526
ALL: Hey!

22:36.600 --> 22:38.125
Merry Christmas!

22:38.280 --> 22:39.281
Thanks for coming.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.283
Robyn, stop it.

22:41.440 --> 22:44.967
I'm just saying, Jordan's good
people, you should get to know her.

22:45.120 --> 22:50.081
What's to know? She's career-obsessed
and lives on her BlackBerry.

22:50.240 --> 22:53.642
True, but she's not some ideal
from a piece of fiction.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.131
Julian.
Brian. Nice to meet you.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.480
Good to see you again, Harper.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.803
Now, her man, on the
other hand, is iconic.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.883
Mmm. If I went that way,
that's what I'd get.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.440
A tall, vanilla swagger latte.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.285
(INHALES)
I like, I like, I like.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.361
What did...

23:09.800 --> 23:10.961
Hi, baby!

23:12.800 --> 23:14.165
Busted!

23:19.000 --> 23:20.650
What's wrong with you, man?

23:20.720 --> 23:22.927
Not now, Quentin.
Not now.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.810
No, dude, you've
been tripping all night.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.240
Don't...

23:27.400 --> 23:29.289
Come here. Come here!

23:30.320 --> 23:31.401
JORDAN:
Hey, Candace!

23:31.480 --> 23:32.481
You look gorgeous.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.444
Thank you, girl.
Thank you so much.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.608
Hi.
Hi, Robyn. How are you?

23:36.760 --> 23:38.205
Hi, Jordan.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.691
How's it going in there?

23:40.800 --> 23:43.610
It's going good, no complaints.

23:43.760 --> 23:45.683
That is going to be a big baby.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.330
(LAUGHING)

23:51.680 --> 23:53.523
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

23:59.920 --> 24:01.524
I mean, beautiful baby.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.441
MIA: Everyone?

24:07.880 --> 24:10.201
I can't tell you
how good it is to have

24:10.280 --> 24:12.442
all of us under
the same roof again.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.045
And Brian, welcome.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.485
Thank you for having me.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.648
I wish it could be
for the whole weekend.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.928
Oh. Where are
you guys headed?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.206
Oh. It's just him.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.481
Oh.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.324
My family's got
a place up in Vermont,

24:24.440 --> 24:26.169
so we always get together
this time of year.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.522
Ski, hang out by the
fireplace, stuff like that.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.886
That sounds really nice.

24:30.040 --> 24:33.567
Yeah, the snow and I just don't
really get along, do we?

24:33.880 --> 24:34.881
Could have fooled me.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.721
Ah!

24:37.840 --> 24:42.084
And Brian and I are going to
Hawaii the day after Christmas.

24:42.520 --> 24:45.251
Oh, you have to stay at the Four
Seasons in Maui. Honeymoon suite.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.050
And which honeymoon was that?

24:47.400 --> 24:48.447
My next one.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.726
(CHUCKLING)

24:49.880 --> 24:52.565
CANDACE: So, Lance, y'all making
the playoffs this year or what?

24:52.760 --> 24:54.922
Yeah, that Atlanta
D is pretty tough.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.481
It is tough, but we will
definitely make the playoffs.

24:57.680 --> 24:58.761
CANDACE:
Okay, all right.

24:58.840 --> 24:59.966
And what about
that rushing record?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.121
How many more
yards is it to go?

25:01.200 --> 25:03.089
Really? We're gonna talk
about football all night?

25:03.160 --> 25:05.322
Oh. I am so sorry, Shelby.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.647
Please, fill us all
in on the scintillating

25:07.720 --> 25:09.643
world of mudslinging
housewives.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.449
Candace.
SHELBY: "Scintillating."

25:11.720 --> 25:13.449
Mmm. Such a big word.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.644
Just like the TV show.
Mmm-hmm.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.126
One hundred seventy-six.

25:19.480 --> 25:20.481
What?

25:20.560 --> 25:22.050
Yards for the record.
Right, Lance?

25:23.240 --> 25:25.641
Right, yeah, 176.
Right.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.482
You remember your
first pro yards?

25:29.920 --> 25:30.887
Oh. Okay, I'll just leave.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.930
Why don't you hop on that broom
and fly back out the window?

25:35.520 --> 25:36.567
Quentin!

25:37.160 --> 25:39.049
So, Murch, how's the
fundraising going?

25:39.960 --> 25:40.961
Oh, uh...

25:41.280 --> 25:44.409
We ran into a snag
this week. (CLEARS THROAT)

25:44.600 --> 25:46.045
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.440
Is it Elliot?

25:47.600 --> 25:49.080
Yeah, he's not
contributing this year.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.204
Elliot Gibson,
the philanthropist?

25:51.320 --> 25:53.049
Isn't he a bit
of a morality nut?

25:53.120 --> 25:56.647
Yeah! Yeah, that's him.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.564
My God.
Did he say why?

25:58.720 --> 26:01.166
To hell with him, man!
We got you.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.924
What's his usual contribution?

26:03.480 --> 26:05.448
Two million.
Oh, hell no.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.201
Murch, if you need anything,
just let me know.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.442
No, no, no!
You sure about that?

26:11.520 --> 26:13.488
You guys have done
more than enough.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.848
Thanks.
I can handle this.

26:17.080 --> 26:20.482
MIA: Listen, I have
a fabulous weekend planned.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.404
And after dessert,
it's pajama time!

26:22.840 --> 26:24.444
You know I like to sleep naked.

26:24.640 --> 26:25.880
ROBYN: Oh, God.
JORDAN: Quentin.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.523
So, about those yards, Lance.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.920
You remember your first...

26:30.080 --> 26:33.243
I'm sorry, can I trouble
you for the bathroom?

26:33.440 --> 26:35.363
Of course.
Lance, could you?

26:35.520 --> 26:36.567
Yeah.

26:41.640 --> 26:42.926
Mmm mmm mmm.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.526
Look at her. That waddle
brings back nightmares.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.806
All of you men need to do your
wives a favor and get snipped.

26:49.960 --> 26:50.961
Jesus.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.681
You too, Robin Thicke.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.281
Yeah, I said it.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.522
Mia, do you have some Prosecco?
Where are those people?

26:57.720 --> 26:59.210
Hello? Excuse me?

26:59.320 --> 27:00.446
(TAPPING GLASS)

27:00.600 --> 27:04.366
QUENTIN: How did this Elliot guy
find this in the first place?

27:04.560 --> 27:06.881
How do I know?
Is he a porn watcher?

27:07.040 --> 27:08.280
First of all, it's not porn.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.805
Well, I'm getting
a little excited.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.291
Cut it out.
Get your hands off.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.846
And 165,328,

27:13.960 --> 27:17.089
29, 30 viewers say otherwise.
(SIGHS)

27:17.160 --> 27:18.446
You're not making this better.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.045
This is getting me
a little excited.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.645
Stop it!

27:21.720 --> 27:22.960
CANDACE:
So, the girls are down.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.641
Oh!

27:26.080 --> 27:29.163
Don't you guys
look cute in your PJs!

27:29.880 --> 27:31.530
Yeah.
Yeah, nice.

27:31.600 --> 27:32.726
Hey, um...

27:33.640 --> 27:35.722
We're going, right, Murch?

27:35.920 --> 27:38.924
Oh. We were gonna go hang out with
the fellas. You don't mind, do you?

27:39.520 --> 27:41.568
Oh. No!

27:41.760 --> 27:43.728
Please, they got 900
channels up in here.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.760
Plus, me and Robyn are gonna sit up and
talk about people, so... (CHUCKLES)

27:47.360 --> 27:49.328
Perfect.
Talking about people.

27:49.720 --> 27:52.007
Oh, um, babe,
can I use your phone?

27:52.080 --> 27:54.048
Because I can't get
a signal up in here.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.601
My Cell?

27:57.640 --> 27:59.847
(STAMMERS)
The one I'm holding?

28:01.840 --> 28:03.205
In my hand?

28:04.640 --> 28:06.961
Yeah, stop!
Would you hand me that?

28:10.480 --> 28:11.845
(PANTING)

28:24.280 --> 28:27.648
Are you sure that
he just smokes weed?

28:31.880 --> 28:33.120
Are you happy?

28:33.280 --> 28:35.282
Yes, very.

28:35.920 --> 28:36.921
And thankful.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.570
Whatever you want, baby.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.326
I want you to be
a little nicer.

28:43.640 --> 28:44.801
I thought I was being nice.

28:45.160 --> 28:46.286
To everybody.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.241
All right.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.483
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

29:09.160 --> 29:11.049
You're doing a bio
on Lance, aren't you?

29:11.120 --> 29:12.121
What?

29:12.280 --> 29:13.641
Oh. Harper,
please don't play dumb.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.683
It belittles both of us.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.681
So this is what you've
been strategizing about!

29:18.680 --> 29:22.127
Uh. Yeah, yeah.
What do you think?

29:22.320 --> 29:24.527
I think it's brilliant.
Have you asked him?

29:24.960 --> 29:27.167
No, I've got to
figure out an approach.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.687
You already got him with
that first yards question.

29:29.840 --> 29:33.208
Just brush off those journalistic
skills and get in there.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.761
You've got to convince him that
he needs to tell his story.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.531
Well, that's a lot
easier said than done.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.206
Well, just keep talking to him.
And you know what?

29:41.360 --> 29:43.169
If you need me to,
I can work on Mia,

29:43.320 --> 29:45.527
because you know
he'll do whatever she says.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.006
All right, cool.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.726
So, where's the thrilla in vanilla?

29:53.160 --> 29:54.161
So, slim.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.689
Is Jordan your first safari
into the enchanted jungle?

30:03.040 --> 30:04.201
Is he serious?

30:04.400 --> 30:08.371
How do we know that this ain't
some Django Candyland fantasy?

30:09.400 --> 30:12.210
(CHUCKLES) Come on, man. I've
dated all kinds of women.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.806
But Jordan is pretty special.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.680
I'm surprised she got
past all of you guys.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.046
Who says she did?

30:26.760 --> 30:28.330
He's just
messing with you, man.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.970
(ALL LAUGHING)

30:32.080 --> 30:33.320
Okay.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.369
Ain't nobody here
been with her, man.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.881
Not that there
wasn't an attempt, though.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.969
What?
Oh, really?

30:43.760 --> 30:45.240
Why would you say
something like that?

30:45.360 --> 30:47.283
I didn't even look at you!
Shut up, Murch.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.771
I'm watching TV.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.048
Look, man, honestly,
we're brother and sister.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.446
For real.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.523
Come on, man, no worries.
It's all good.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.523
I'd have to be
a bitch to be concerned

30:56.600 --> 30:57.840
about her past
like that, right?

31:02.520 --> 31:03.885
I like him.

31:04.040 --> 31:06.042
Do you think
Brian is going to pop

31:06.120 --> 31:08.771
the question when
you guys get to Hawaii?

31:09.040 --> 31:10.929
No, I don't think
we're there yet.

31:11.080 --> 31:12.889
Armstrong, you are
such a commitment-phobe.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.451
No, I'm not a
commitment-phobe.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.130
I just don't do it
as often as you do.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.288
Oh, touché, bitch!

31:18.760 --> 31:21.570
Jordan, this is the longest
relationship you've ever had.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.484
Why are you being so defensive?

31:23.680 --> 31:25.648
I am not being defensive!

31:25.960 --> 31:27.405
So, what is it?

31:28.440 --> 31:30.124
I just don't know
that I'm ready to...

31:30.320 --> 31:31.481
Give up the big, black dick?

on the big, black dick?

31:36.560 --> 31:39.291
Big, black dick.
It's big, it's black.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.721
It just goes in your
mouth, in your ass.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.485
You want to talk to it like it's a mic.
"Check, check."

31:44.640 --> 31:46.005
(CHUCKLES)

31:47.800 --> 31:50.485
Oh, don't hate.
Emulate, bitches.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.130
You've got to talk to it.

31:52.760 --> 31:53.841
LANCE: Oh.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.325
Hey, man, do you guys
want me to step out?

31:59.520 --> 32:02.251
No. See that, Murch? You can't
even tell what happened.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.442
Or, if something did
happen, you can't tell.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.204
Oh, so I should be okay
knowing that my wife

32:06.320 --> 32:07.845
might have been the headmaster?

32:08.520 --> 32:12.081
Well, you did marry a stripper.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.691
Yeah, but that
didn't matter to me.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.169

matter to you then,

32:16.240 --> 32:18.083
why in the hell is it
mattering to you now?

32:18.160 --> 32:20.003
Could you just put your phone
away, please? Thank you.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.322
Well, now I have two
million dollars to raise.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.209
And I have two little girls!

32:24.360 --> 32:26.362
What if Keisha and Kelly decide
they want to dance for money?

32:26.520 --> 32:27.885
You did marry a stripper.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.166
Would you stop
saying that, please?

32:29.240 --> 32:30.321
You married a stripper.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.041
QUENTIN:
You know what?

32:33.200 --> 32:35.441
We can solve it
with one question.

32:35.640 --> 32:36.641
JULIAN: What's that?

32:36.720 --> 32:38.290
Which one of them,
either Shelby

32:38.360 --> 32:41.170
or Candace is better
at rocking the mic?

32:43.720 --> 32:45.131
Yeah, I don't remember.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.561
What?

32:49.720 --> 32:51.051
What?
Murch, come on, man.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.120
Every man remembers
his personal best headmaster.

32:54.000 --> 32:54.967
Co-sign.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.805
Yeah, and he should know.
He's been with white chicks.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.246
They can do it.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.247
Murch?

33:03.200 --> 33:04.201
Shelby.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.680
Word?
Was it even close?

33:09.400 --> 33:10.925
No, not really, no.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.562
(GASPS) Murch.
I know.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.889
Hell no, it ain't close.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.485
Amen.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.686
Really?

33:18.760 --> 33:19.960
QUENTIN:
Look, I'm just saying.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.411
If Candace

33:21.600 --> 33:23.090
ain't the best at
rocking the mic...

33:23.160 --> 33:25.160
I didn't say that. I didn't
say she's not the best.

33:25.240 --> 33:28.608
She can rock the mic.
She's rocking the mic.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.366
She-mutt rocks it, right?

33:30.440 --> 33:32.408
Yes, she does...
I'm done.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.005
I'm saying,
if she's not the best

33:34.080 --> 33:36.651
at rocking the mic,
then maybe she didn't.

33:37.560 --> 33:38.561
Good point.

33:38.720 --> 33:39.767
<i>JORDAN: So, Mia.</i>

33:40.360 --> 33:43.443
What do you think Lance is gonna
do with all of his new free time?

33:43.600 --> 33:46.604
Oh, you better get him some golf
lessons or he will drive you crazy.

33:46.760 --> 33:49.127
Look, he can drive
me crazy all he wants.

33:49.280 --> 33:52.443
Plus, the children would
love to have him around.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.284
It's gonna be nice.

33:54.440 --> 33:57.603
Has he ever thought about
writing his memoirs?

33:57.800 --> 33:59.404
He'd never get that bored.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.401
Yeah, you're probably right,
but you know what?

34:01.800 --> 34:04.167
He's got such a legacy,
and I think people

34:04.240 --> 34:06.447
would love to hear his story.
Your story!

34:06.800 --> 34:08.040
I don't know, it just seems like,

34:08.120 --> 34:11.647
with him retiring, it would be
the perfect time to reflect.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.121
Mmm.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.324
Yeah, maybe you're right.

34:16.920 --> 34:18.331
Maybe it is.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.286
JULIAN: (CHUCKLES)
Nice move, nice.

34:22.440 --> 34:25.011
Didn't Shelby and
Mia pledge together?

34:25.159 --> 34:26.571
Yes, line sisters.

34:26.639 --> 34:27.641
Line sisters.
Mmm-hmm.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.489
That's why her ass is up here.

34:30.639 --> 34:31.766
Exactly.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.650
Mia and Lance, they take
their Greek life seriously.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.606
What is that, "Friendship
is essential to the soul"?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.286
That's right.

34:40.440 --> 34:44.489
Along with manhood, scholarship,
perseverance and uplifting.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.681
In case y'all didn't know.
HARPER: Okay.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.239
You think your kids
are gonna pledge?

34:48.320 --> 34:49.481
Ain't no think.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.809
Sullivan has been
frat over 100 years,

34:51.880 --> 34:53.245
and we're gonna
keep that moving.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.005
JULIAN:
Oh! Nice.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.970
So, tradition, that's one of
your main principles, then?

34:59.120 --> 35:00.400
I didn't say nothing about that.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.205
All right, everybody, then.

35:03.920 --> 35:05.490
If you had to boil
your principles down

35:05.560 --> 35:08.211
into three words,
what would they be?

35:08.360 --> 35:13.571
For me, it would be creativity,
stability and partnership.

35:16.520 --> 35:19.967
Tradition, family and love.

35:21.720 --> 35:22.846
JULIAN: Ancestry,

35:23.840 --> 35:25.285
perseverance,

35:26.440 --> 35:27.726
children.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.325
Money, bitches,
pussy and getting head.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.886
Mother...
That's four, first off.

35:35.040 --> 35:38.647
Money, bitches,
pussy/getting head.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.051
(CHUCKLES)

35:40.680 --> 35:41.841
Mmm mmm mmm.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.405
God, family, football.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.403
In that order?

35:53.360 --> 35:54.407
In that order.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.331
(EXHALES)
L-Boogie!

36:13.040 --> 36:14.929
I thought I'd hit
the trail myself.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.570
Show me the way?

36:22.840 --> 36:26.686
Well, the kids look beautiful.
Getting big.

36:26.840 --> 36:27.887
You must be proud.

36:30.120 --> 36:32.088
Yeah, no doubt, man.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.288
It's the best thing
I could've ever done.

36:34.440 --> 36:35.885
Are you excited?

36:35.960 --> 36:37.610
Me?
Yeah, I'm excited.

36:37.760 --> 36:38.841
Nervous.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.611
Yeah, Robyn and I
were having trouble

36:43.720 --> 36:44.960
conceiving. I don't
know if you heard.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.401
Yeah, I did hear something about that.
Was it low sperm count?

36:47.480 --> 36:49.801
What? No, no.
No, I'm good.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.810
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm not ashamed.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.521
It's just a little bit more of a
challenge than we anticipated.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.605
(PANTING)

37:00.040 --> 37:01.280
Are you all right?

37:01.440 --> 37:04.330
I think I got a pebble
in my shoe or something.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.769
You're not the
author of this, man.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.604
What do you mean?

37:13.760 --> 37:16.127
You know, Faith was a breech baby.
For real?

37:16.280 --> 37:17.645
Yeah, no doubt.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.245
29 hours of labor,

37:19.400 --> 37:23.121
and my little baby girl wasn't even
breathing when she came into this world.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.286
Longest 15 seconds of my life.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.003
But our faith.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.045
Our faith never wavered.

37:33.240 --> 37:35.686
Yeah, God's always
got a plan, man.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.720
Just got to trust everything's
going to work out.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.889
I got a team meeting.
Let's do this.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.284
I'll give you a head start.

37:46.520 --> 37:47.760
(MOANING)

37:50.200 --> 37:51.440
You were amazing this morning.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.400
I thought we were gonna
wake up the whole house.

37:53.520 --> 37:54.851
(CHUCKLES)

37:58.280 --> 37:59.566
You know how much I love you?

38:00.040 --> 38:02.042
Yes, I know how
much you love me.

38:02.120 --> 38:04.009
No, seriously,
do you know how much?

38:04.080 --> 38:06.287
I know that
you're gonna be late.

38:07.800 --> 38:10.371
Wow.
Always on a schedule.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.042
That's me.
I can't help it.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.645
And I love who you are.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.087
Believe me, your whole strong,
independent,

38:17.160 --> 38:19.401
Olivia Pope thing is very sexy.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.725
But sometimes you act
like you don't need me.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.606
I don't.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.328
Everybody needs
somebody, Jordan.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.481
I'll call you when I land.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.404
Yeah. Or maybe I
should just text you.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.164
Is that better?
No. Call me.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.491
(ENGINE STARTS)

38:54.480 --> 38:56.608
Harper, I'm gonna need you
to go to the store later.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.766
Okay, sure.
What's going on?

38:59.920 --> 39:01.081
I'm making dinner tonight.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.608
The caterer broke his arm
slipping on some ice.

39:04.760 --> 39:05.807
Huh.

39:05.880 --> 39:08.770
Too late to find
a replacement, so...

39:08.920 --> 39:10.251
Well, isn't that a lot of work?

39:10.320 --> 39:12.368
I'm fine, Harper.

39:13.920 --> 39:16.366
Okay.
I'll go get dressed.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.805
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

39:22.280 --> 39:25.045
So, what's Harper
been working on?

39:25.560 --> 39:26.800
Anything new?

39:28.240 --> 39:29.810
Quentin, you're sure you
got the Thai basil, right?

39:29.880 --> 39:32.326
Yes, man! You told me
for like the 20th time.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.401
I'm just saying.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.967
God!
Robyn's real specific.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.963
Plus, you can't tell
a pregnant lady shit.

39:38.040 --> 39:39.246
You got a point there.

39:39.320 --> 39:42.642
Yeah, man. Y'all getting your
balls back for Christmas or what?

39:42.720 --> 39:43.881
Married folk.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.804
Anyway, shoot.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.644
She's supposed to be
on maternity leave.

39:47.720 --> 39:50.849
Here she goes cooking
a four-course meal.

39:50.920 --> 39:51.967
Good for her, man.

39:52.040 --> 39:54.042
She's got Jordan here, man.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.161
She isn't going to be outdone.

39:55.240 --> 39:56.241
Not in the kitchen.
That's her arena.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.401
It's not even like that.

39:57.480 --> 39:59.209
Yeah, it is.
There's hell of a tension.

39:59.280 --> 40:02.011
Man, they should drop the gloves
and start smacking each other.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.889
I hope they show
a titty or something.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.325
No question.
I'm just playin', man.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.686
I know you ain't talking.

40:06.800 --> 40:10.964
Between your wife and your ex, it's
like what, Mob <i>Wives</i> up in here.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.088
You need to have
a pay-per-view event.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.924
Not a bad idea. Maybe that's
the way you can close that

40:15.000 --> 40:16.411
two-million gap you got.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

40:16.480 --> 40:17.811
I got it.
Hold up.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.008
I got to take this.
Hold that, hold that.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.286
Hi. Hi.

40:21.560 --> 40:22.561
Hello?

40:22.640 --> 40:24.051
Cute little fuchsia phone you got.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.121
Two million.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.525
That's a big nut.

40:27.640 --> 40:29.688
Yeah, man.
He's going through it, huh?

40:29.840 --> 40:31.683
Everybody's going through it.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.763
Well, how are you doing, shorty?

40:35.000 --> 40:35.967
What do you mean?

40:36.040 --> 40:37.280
You cool?

40:37.360 --> 40:38.441
Yeah.

40:39.080 --> 40:40.161
Money-wise?

40:40.880 --> 40:42.644
Because of the credit card.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.290
No, I'm cool.
It always happens.

40:44.360 --> 40:47.250
I got to call the company, because
it's getting embarrassing, but I'm...

40:47.320 --> 40:49.448
No, this is embarrassing, man.
I'm your man.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.246
Look, you got a baby coming,

40:51.400 --> 40:53.528
and if you need something,
you talk to your friends.

40:53.600 --> 40:54.761
Yeah, I'm good.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.649
Good looking-out.
I appreciate it though.

40:56.800 --> 40:57.881
You're a sensitive brother.

40:57.960 --> 40:59.962
For real. I'm straight.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.246
Hurry up, Murch.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.522
SHELBY: What are you doing?
What am I paying you for?

41:03.600 --> 41:05.011
I'm "TV's Most Notorious."

41:05.080 --> 41:06.889
The endorsements
should be rolling in.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.121
Notorious Martinis.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.611
Notorious Heels.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.683
Notorious Bubble Bath.
Why am I thinking of this?

41:11.840 --> 41:12.887
Hold on.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.042
Kennedy, please stop eating!

41:15.600 --> 41:16.681
What is wrong with you?

41:17.480 --> 41:19.642
What's wrong with you?
What do you know about this?

41:19.760 --> 41:21.808
I know a lot more than you do.
You have a child?

41:21.880 --> 41:24.680
I don't need to have a child in order
to know how to deal with a child.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.041
I know how to deal with a child.
No, you don't!

41:26.120 --> 41:27.770
You're over here dealing
with everything else!

41:27.880 --> 41:30.850
I'm on the phone! Why don't
you get out of my business?

41:37.560 --> 41:40.166
I'm sorry, Mia. You want to help?
Help Kennedy.

41:41.240 --> 41:42.651
I ain't nobody's babysitter.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.411
Better call your baby daddy.

41:47.640 --> 41:48.766
I hate your momma.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.684
Ugh! Honestly.
I hate him.

41:54.760 --> 41:56.364
Wait a minute.
This isn't my...

41:57.560 --> 41:58.721
Oh.

41:59.360 --> 42:03.251
I was hoping that we could
schedule a face-to-face meeting.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.367

I'm sorry, could you...

42:07.120 --> 42:09.964
Just give me one second.
I'm really sorry, sir.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.610
Kind of busy right now, Shelby.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.848
Are you sure this
isn't a good time?

42:16.640 --> 42:17.687
(CHUCKLES)

42:18.800 --> 42:20.211
Good times.

42:20.360 --> 42:21.441
Get your ass in here!

Hey! Hi, girls.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.606
Hey!

42:25.880 --> 42:29.043
Wow! This looks amazing.
And it smells so good.

42:29.200 --> 42:30.645
Doesn't it?

42:31.120 --> 42:32.167
Thanks.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.924
So, what are you making?

42:34.720 --> 42:36.085
Salad.

42:36.240 --> 42:37.605

MIA: Wait a minute, Lance.
Now. At this time.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:39.850
No. You wait a minute.
Look at this.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.088
Don't read that. "First pro
yards, guiding principles..."

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.844
Trying to get at my kids!

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.843
Lance!
All that bullshit, babe.

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.086
Just go to the car.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.845
You let me handle this.
You hear me?

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.246
I got this.

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.445
Mia... Don't you say a
motherfucking thing to her.

01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.644
You ain't nothing but a
goddamn snake in the grass.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.484
That's what you are.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.650
You stay away from me.
You stay away from my family!

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:09.009
Forever this time.
You hear me? Forever!

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.526
Come on.
Calm down.

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:12.085
Just... Let's go.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.686
Listen.
I can't believe I...

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.410
Lance, talk to me.
Little sneaky snake.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.041
No, no. I'm done talking.
Just get in the car.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.645
(ENGINE STARTING)

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.804
What did you do now?

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.521
ROBYN:
Can you put that in the car?

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.886
And you think it'll
fit with the luggage?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.843
Yeah. Perfect.
Yeah? Okay.

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.521
BOTH: Daddy!

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.806
What the!

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.240
Hello!

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:44.842
Oh, my gosh!

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.490
I missed you so much!

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.324
Look at you.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.688
How was Grandma's? Was it fun?
GIRL: Yes.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.641
Hey, girls, you want
some hot chocolate?

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:54.881
BOTH: Yes!

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.645
Mommy, can we?

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.563
Please, please, please!

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.166
Just for a little while.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.561
BOTH:
Yay!

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.041
Can we talk?

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.484
I am going to resign, Julian.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.401
Absolutely not.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.401
No.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.525
Candace, listen to me.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.721
The school does
not work without you.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.529
We can find another way.
Together.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:39.210
Listen.
I don't care what happened.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.365
Because I love you.

(SNIFFLING)

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.047

Okay?

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.407
Okay.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.046
Okay.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.886
And for the record,
it was once.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.009
I was young and I was stupid,

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.321
and I was drunk!
Babe...

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:35.601
Stop.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.728
But I have moved on

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.164
and I am those girls' mother.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.525
And Julian,

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:53.529
I am your wife.
Come to me first.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.002
Yes, baby. I'm sorry.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.007
I'm sorry.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.687
You and those girls
are my entire life.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.209
Just please forgive me.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:06.961
Please.

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.809
I guess.
Baby

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.804
I love you, Julian.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.360
I am so sorry.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.491
CANDACE: I love you.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.286
Lance, calm down.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.566
How can I calm down?

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.928
I let my guard down.
I let my guard down!

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.724
I got sucker-punched. Again!

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:25.767
We don't know the full story...

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.968
I know enough of the story.
You think you do.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.122
But we won't know until
we speak with Harper.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.567
No. Fuck Harper!
Fuck him!

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.361
Right.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:38.727
There it is.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.246
What?

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.800
You're so filled
with anger that you...

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:47.123
And it's all aimed at him, but
we all played a part in it.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.565
No. No, Mia.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.085
We have never had
this discussion before,

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.730
and we are not about
to start right now!

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.804
Tell me how
angry you are at me.

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.121
I deserve it.

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.241
No.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.924
I knew what I was doing.

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.730
I knew I was wrong.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.844
And I knew it would hurt you.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.882
And I'm sorry for that.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.241
And I'm sorry that I chose him.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.321
It's my fault what
it's done to you two.

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:27.291
And I can't rest knowing that
you're still holding on to this.

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.646
You chose him?

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.765
It's weighing you down.
You need to let go.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.046
You need him.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:37.646
I don't need him.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.287
Yeah.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:41.686
Yeah, you do.

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.128
You need to forgive.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.209
I will never forgive him.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.291
I need you to.

01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:59.444
Lance, look at me.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.528
I called us a car, man.

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.601
You should go on.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.480
I'll probably just end up
staying here or something.

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.129
That was some
melodramatic shit.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.244
Guess you're off your high
horse now, ain't you?

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.207
So, you're just gonna
kick me when I'm down, huh?

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.841
I told you, karma's a bitch, man.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.080
I deserve this.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.728
No. Ain't nobody
deserve misery.

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.280
But it's just your turn now.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.680
See, that's exactly why
I don't tell people shit.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.166
And how's that helped you?

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:13.206
Look, your marriage
is on the rocks,

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.161
you tried to exploit your best
friend for financial gain,

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:19.250
and you got a low sperm count.

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.924
I don't have a low sperm...

Don't lie to Santa.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.446
And don't be embarrassed, man.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.601
It's just weird.

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.364
Because you rarely
hear about brothers

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:34.801

fertility issues.

do you need something?

We're worried about you, man.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.090
Do you need some money?

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:29.766
Yeah.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.324
I got you. Okay?

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.966
You just got to promise me one thing.
Yeah?

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:25.606
I did it.

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:29.281
My hero.

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:37.802
I love you, Lance Sullivan.

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:43.120
I love you.
I love you so much.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.847
Merry Christmas.

01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:28.523
Hey.
I'll see you over there.

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:30.967
Hey, Harp. Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:33.480
Hey, Harper.

01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.401
Hi, Julian.

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:40.368
Listen, before I'm all crazed
and hopped up on Valium,

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.602
I wanted to give you this.

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:45.885
What's this?

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:47.886
It's your Christmas miracle.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.651
Shelby, I can't.
You can. And you will.

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.731
Just one condition.

01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:58.287
Can we just arrange some
playdates for the girls?

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:01.806
Sure.

01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:05.566
Thank you.

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:06.881
Okay.

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:24.486
I'm sorry.

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.566
Mia Morgan Sullivan

01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:17.849
was one of the greatest people
any of us has ever known.

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:22.924
Even though none of us wanted
to believe she would be here,

01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:24.406
she knew.

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:28.125
<i>She knew she would.</i>

01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:29.691
Take your time.

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:31.291
Come on, babies.

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:34.444
<i>She made sure that we
would all be here, too.</i>

01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:37.282
Not to mourn death,

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:40.130
but to celebrate life.

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:45.162
Being with her in the days
leading to her home-going,

01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:51.245
was the greatest gift
any of us have ever received.

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.561
Because of her,

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.764
we are friends for life.

Mia was, and is an angel.

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:21.086
It's tragically ironic that the
day we received the Son of God,

01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:24.841
<i>he called one of
his daughters home.</i>

01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:32.086

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.407
I know.

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:38.609
But this one...

01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:45.761

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.087
It's okay.

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:38.562

The potato salad is great.

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:40.848

01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.490
Maybe it's in the stars.

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.845
Quentin, we're both
emotional right now.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.889
This is not a love connection.

What if it is?

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:11.081
I wonder what
would happen if...

01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:14.047
If you and I really
gave it a shot.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.729
Oh, hell no.

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:21.206
Where's my underwear?

01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:23.803
You didn't wear any.

01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:26.806
Oh, yeah.

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:29.004
That was nice.

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:31.524
You're disgusting.

01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:34.725
Hey, L.

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:37.681
Robyn and I are
about to take off.

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.410
Do you need anything?

01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.164
No, I'm good, man, thanks.

01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:42.691
Okay.

01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:47.087
That was a great eulogy, man.

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:48.881
It was perfect.

01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:50.801
Thanks.

01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:55.847
Whatever he's doing up there,

01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:58.402
I don't know, I just don't
think it's fair, man.

01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:01.846
I don't think I can have faith
in something like that.

01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:04.251
I hear you, man.

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:07.084
But he's always there.

01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:13.841
That's why you'll
always be the better man.

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:17.642
Thanks for the baby clothes.

01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:19.922
And keep in touch.

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.441
All right.

01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:39.240
I'm going to go to the kitchen.
Do you need anything?

01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:40.970
I'm fine, honey. Thanks.

01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.530
Baby, I know you're fine.

Oh, hey, Julian, I talked
to a couple of people,

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.566
I might have some leads for
you if you're interested.

01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:51.762
There's always next year, sure!

01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:53.725
Excuse us, ladies.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.242

01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:05.965

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:07.811
I love him.

01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:10.325
Yeah, I love him.

01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:11.891

01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:17.040
Are you okay, Robyn?

01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:19.527
Yeah, I'm fine,
I just... Oh!

01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:21.291
Oh, my God, you're ¡n labor.

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.646
ROBYN: No, no, I'm not.

01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:25.644
Just help me up so
I can go to the bathroom.

01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:28.361
Oh!

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:30.481
Oh, my God, it's happening.

01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:39.081
Okay. How far apart
are the contractions?

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:41.241
They're about 10 minutes.

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:43.010
HARPER: She said
about 10 minutes.

01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:44.161
Lance, hurry.

01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:46.044
We're about 45
minutes at least.

01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:48.567
JORDAN: Just breathe,
Robyn, just breathe.

01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:52.248
Not anymore, Harp.
HARPER: Oh, no.

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:53.526
What the hell?

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:54.681
Oh, Harper!

01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:56.922
You're doing great.
Just hang in there, baby.

01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:58.690
Harp?
Yeah?

01:52:58.840 --> 01:52:59.841
Hop out.
We got to talk.

(YELLS)

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:06.205
Okay, what's up?
This baby ain't gonna wait, okay?

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:08.283
The contractions are too close.
I'm gonna call my doctor.

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:10.283
He delivered all my
kids and I trust him.

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:12.922
Okay, great.
Hold on, Harp.

01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:15.405
I got to check her cervix.

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:18.121
Come again?

01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:19.486
He's gonna need to
talk me through this

01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:20.881
in case things
get a little hairy.

01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:23.083
I mean, critical.

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:25.209
I know,
but you're not a doctor.

01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:26.447
I know. Look, Harp,

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:29.160
I was there for all my kids. The
nurses taught me how to measure.

01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:31.202
And I know my way
around a vagina.

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:35.326
It was a joke. Just trying
to lighten the mood.

01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.291
Okay, but the baby's breech.

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:41.088
I got you, Harp, okay?
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.480
All right, I should tell Robyn.

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:45.481
I heard! Just do it!
Let's go!

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:50.284
Robyn, I'm just gonna measure,
that's all. Just gonna measure.

No, no! Oh, God.

Hang in there, baby.

01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:30.646
Lance, I was supposed
to have a C-section.

01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:32.922
I didn't want to be cut,
but I want you to cut me.

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.011
What?
No, no, no, baby.

01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:36.200
I'm talking to Lance.
Okay.

01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:38.726
No one's gonna cut you, sweetie.
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:40.086
Right, Harp?

01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:42.642
Right, Harp?
Right, yeah.

Everything's gonna be fine, baby.
All right? You're doing great.

01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:48.085
Robyn, on this
next contraction,

01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:49.969
I want you to push, okay?
Are you with me?

01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:51.963
You're gonna push, okay?
Okay.

01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:53.246
Here it comes.

01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:54.321
Push.
(GRUNTS)

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:56.129

Push, baby, push!

Oh, shit!

01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.161
I got the feet.

Oh, God! It's feet!

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:07.286
Just like Faith.

You're doing real good.

Here comes another one.

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:17.483
No, no, no, don't push, okay?
Just breathe.
