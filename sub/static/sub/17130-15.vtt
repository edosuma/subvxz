WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:02.836
OKAY.

00:02.836 --> 00:03.937
HEY, ANGIE.

00:03.937 --> 00:06.807
HONEY...
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

00:06.807 --> 00:10.978
YOU DINGED SOMEONE'S CAR
AT THE GROCERY STORE AGAIN.

00:10.978 --> 00:14.082
IT'S MORE SERIOUS THAN THAT.

00:14.082 --> 00:16.084
YOU LEFT A NOTE?!

00:16.084 --> 00:18.086
LOOK, I TOLD YOU, ANGIE,

00:18.086 --> 00:19.887
JUST PRETEND YOU'RE WRITING
SOMETHING DOWN

00:19.887 --> 00:22.790
AND GET THE HELL OUTTA THERE!
WE WENT OVER THIS!

00:22.790 --> 00:25.893
NO. CLAUDIA DIED TODAY.

00:25.893 --> 00:29.430
OH, MAN, I WAS HOPIN'
YOU WOULDN'T FIND OUT.

00:29.430 --> 00:33.067
LOOK, MAX'S FISH IS DEAD
BECAUSE OF ME.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.437
I PUT CLAUDIA IN A COFFEE CUP
TO CLEAN HER TANK,

00:36.437 --> 00:38.439
THEN I FORGOT
SHE WAS IN THE CUP,

00:38.439 --> 00:40.441
AND I POURED
HOT COFFEE IN THERE.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.443
IF YOU THOUGHT HER EYES
WERE BIG BEFORE, ANGIE,

00:42.443 --> 00:44.645
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
WHEN THE DECAF HIT HER.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.680
SHE WAS LIKE, "OH!"

00:46.680 --> 00:50.017
MAX'S FISH
IS CALLED "CLAUDIUS."

00:50.017 --> 00:53.354
CLAUDIA WAS
MY BROTHER'S EX-WIFE.

00:53.354 --> 00:56.224
OH, OH, I'M SORRY.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.492
SHE WAS SICK
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.

00:58.492 --> 01:01.495
SO, IN A WAY, IT'S A RELIEF.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.531
WELL, AT LEAST SHE'S NOT
SUFFERING ANYMORE, ANGIE--

01:03.531 --> 01:05.733
NOT LIKE THAT FISH.
POOR GUY.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.468
I BURNED ONE OF HIS FINS,

01:07.468 --> 01:09.670
HE WAS SWIMMING
IN A CIRCLE LIKE THAT.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.205
(blowing)

01:11.205 --> 01:13.207
I'M LOOKING INTO FLIGHTS
FOR MIAMI.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.476
THE FUNERAL'S ON SATURDAY,

01:15.476 --> 01:17.678
AND THEY'RE GONNA
READ THE WILL LATER ON.
WHOA, HEY,
WHY DO WE HAVE TO GO?

01:17.678 --> 01:19.680
CLAUDIA
DIVORCED YOUR BROTHER.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.682
WE SHOULD BE THERE
FOR VERONICA.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.684
SHE'S OUR GODDAUGHTER.
SHE JUST LOST HER MOM,

01:23.684 --> 01:26.487
AND WHO KNOWS
WHERE HER DAD IS?

01:26.487 --> 01:28.489
YEAH, BUT WHY DO I HAVE
TO GO DOWN THERE, ANGIE?

01:28.489 --> 01:30.491
ALL YOUR RELATIVES
TREAT ME LIKE DIRT

01:30.491 --> 01:32.493
JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE MONEY.
LOOK, I'M RICH IN OTHER WAYS

01:32.493 --> 01:35.463
LIKE HAIR AND CHOLESTEROL,
THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.799
HOW ABOUT THIS?

01:38.799 --> 01:40.100
AFTER THE SERVICE,

01:40.100 --> 01:42.102
YOU CAN SLIP OUT
AND PLAY GOLF

01:42.102 --> 01:44.104
AT MY COUSIN'S
COUNTRY CLUB.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.141
18 HOLES
RIGHT ON THE OCEAN.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.845
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GO TO MIAMI, ANGIE,

01:51.845 --> 01:53.847
BUT FOR MY GODDAUGHTER...

01:53.847 --> 01:55.749
BECAUSE I PROMISED THE LORD.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.888
I'M JUST TAKING MY CLUBS
AS A SHOW OF FAITH.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.596
WELL, LOOK, THERE THEY ARE.

02:08.596 --> 02:09.630
DON'T START.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.932
NOT ALL MY RELATIVES
LOOK DOWN ON YOU.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.267
HEY, THERE'S
YOUR AUNT TIPSY.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.703
OH.
EXCUSE ME. HI, ANGIE.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.438
HI, AUNT LYNETTE.

02:17.438 --> 02:20.040
RUMOR HAS IT
YOU DIVORCED GEORGE.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.743
CONGRATULATIONS.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.478
OH.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.480
YOU'RE STILL MARRIED.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.583
AH, YOU'RE STILL
DRINKING.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.685
OH, LOOK, ANGIE,
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

02:31.685 --> 02:32.720
OH.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.754
ANGIE.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.888
Ã³RALE.

02:34.888 --> 02:38.125
GEORGE, I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU IN YEARS.

02:38.125 --> 02:41.495
SO TELL ME, KIDS, HOW WAS
YOUR BUS RIDE FROM L.A., HUH?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.697
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HELL.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.999
WE TOOK A PLANE.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.335
OH, OF COURSE. (laughs)

02:47.335 --> 02:49.537
OH, IT MUST HAVE BEEN
EXCITING.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.804
(laughs)

02:50.804 --> 02:53.140
SO TELL ME, WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN UP TO, GEORGE?

02:53.140 --> 02:55.142
OH, I JUST GOT OUT
ON PAROLE.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.910
MY ANKLE BRACELET'S
BEEPIN' RIGHT NOW.

02:56.910 --> 03:01.081
I WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE THAT YARD.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.750
THIS VATO WAS LOOKING
AT ANGIE THE WRONG WAY,

03:02.750 --> 03:04.385
SO I STABBED HIM,
AND I LICKED THE KNIFE.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.919
'CAUSE THAT'S
HOW I ROLL, FOOL.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.922
I'LL BURN A STRIKE
RIGHT HERE.
GEORGE...

03:08.922 --> 03:11.191
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WELL, THAT'S HOW
THEY SEE ME, ANYWAY.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.860
I'M JUST GIVIN' 'EM
WHAT THEY WANT.

03:12.860 --> 03:16.264
I'LL BE AT THE BAR.
I'M IN MY OWN HELL. I TOLD YOU.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.802
I CAN'T BELIEVE
MY OWN BROTHER

03:21.802 --> 03:23.804
DIDN'T SHOW UP TO HELP VERONICA
THROUGH THIS.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.574
TSK.
WELL, IT'S NO SURPRISE.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.942
HE'S NEVER BEEN THERE
FOR HIS DAUGHTER.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.679
I'LL TAKE A BEER AND TWO OLIVES
TO STUFF IN MY EAR

03:31.679 --> 03:33.514
SO I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN
TO ANY MORE OF THESE PEOPLE.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.516
YEAH, MY FAMILY'S
EASIER TO DEAL WITH

03:35.516 --> 03:36.817
AFTER A COUPLE DRINKS.

03:36.817 --> 03:40.488
A GOOD BARTENDER
JUST LISTENS.

03:40.488 --> 03:44.191
AND A GOOD UNCLE
RECOGNIZES HIS GODDAUGHTER.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.193
PROBABLY.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.195
I'M STILL WAITIN'
ON THAT BEER.

03:48.195 --> 03:51.299
UNCLE GEORGE,
IT'S ME, VERONICA.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.501
VERONICA, LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP.
MM-HMM.

03:53.501 --> 03:56.770
LAST TIME I SAW YOU, YOU HAD
A PONYTAIL AND BABY FAT.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.306
SO DID YOU.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.308
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE
A FULL DIAPER.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.810
LOOK, YOU DON'T WANNA
PLAY THIS GAME...

04:04.177 --> 04:06.580
HOW ARE YOU?
MM, I'M OKAY.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.582
I'M A LITTLE
HUNGOVER, THOUGH.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.618
MY FRIENDS TOOK ME TO THIS CLUB
LAST NIGHT TO CHEER ME UP.

04:10.618 --> 04:13.554
IT HAD PYROTECHNICS
AND ALL THESE SIRENS.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.556
I WISH I COULD
GO BACK THERE TONIGHT,

04:15.556 --> 04:20.328
BUT IT TURNS OUT IT WAS JUST
A REGULAR CLUB ON FIRE.

04:20.328 --> 04:23.030
AUNT ANGIE.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.832
I AM SO SORRY. YOU KNOW,

04:24.832 --> 04:27.601
YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO COME STAY WITH US IN L.A.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.003
OH, THANK YOU,
BUT I'M DOING OKAY HERE.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.205
MY MOM TOLD ME THAT
SHE'S LEAVING ME ENOUGH MONEY

04:32.205 --> 04:34.875
SO THAT
I'LL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.711
LUCKY. WHEN MY MOM DIES,
ALL I GET

04:37.711 --> 04:40.714
IS A BUNCH OF OLD LADY CLOTHES
AND A GOLD TOOTH.

04:40.714 --> 04:44.184
IT'S NOT EVEN HERS.
SHE WON IT IN A POKER GAME.

04:44.184 --> 04:47.621
SWEETHEART, WE'RE STARTING
YOUR MOTHER'S VIDEO.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.922
EVERYONE GATHER AROUND.

04:48.922 --> 04:52.059
IT'S TIME TO HEAR
CLAUDIA'S WILL.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.061
VERONICA HAS REALLY CHANGED.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.863
HER MOTHER JUST PASSED AWAY,

04:55.863 --> 04:57.865
AND ALL SHE'S TALKIN' ABOUT
IS THE MONEY.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.867
IT'S LIKE
IT DIDN'T EVEN AFFECT HER.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.869
WELL, NOT EVERYONE CRIES
WHEN PEOPLE DIE, ANGIE.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.772
SOME PEOPLE CASH IN A GOLD TOOTH
AND THROW A PARTY.

05:06.907 --> 05:10.911
HELLO, EVERYONE,
I'M CLAUDIA.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.746
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL
DYING TO FIND OUT

05:12.746 --> 05:14.948
WHO GETS MY MILLIONS,

05:14.948 --> 05:16.750
SO HERE IT IS...

05:16.750 --> 05:21.088
I'M LEAVING EVERYTHING
TO MY DAUGHTER VERONICA.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.624
EVERYTHING?

05:23.624 --> 05:25.759
NOW YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT
ALL RIGHT AWAY.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.761
THE MONEY HAS BEEN
PUT INTO A TRUST,

05:27.761 --> 05:29.763
AND THE TRUSTEE
I'M ABOUT TO NAME

05:29.763 --> 05:31.765
WILL DECIDE
WHEN YOU GET IT.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.767
THE PERSON I CHOSE
HAS WORKED HARD HIS WHOLE LIFE

05:33.767 --> 05:35.769
AND KNOWS
THE VALUE OF MONEY.

05:35.769 --> 05:39.573
WILL VIC PALMERO
PLEASE STEP FORWARD?

05:44.778 --> 05:47.715
OKAY, NOW BEND OVER
AND KISS GEORGE LOPEZ'S ASS

05:47.715 --> 05:50.384
BECAUSE I PICK HIM.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.988
(laughs)

05:54.988 --> 05:56.323
IN YOUR FACE!

05:56.323 --> 05:58.892
YOU HEARD HER, VIC,
KISS IT.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.963
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

06:06.199 --> 06:09.336
* ALL MY FRIENDS

06:09.336 --> 06:10.704
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

06:22.583 --> 06:25.686
HEY, MAX. THIS IS
YOUR COUSIN VERONICA.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.688
HEY, MAX.
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW HER
TO THE SPARE ROOM?

06:27.688 --> 06:29.389
SHE'S GONNA STAY WITH US
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.991
IT'S UP HERE.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.463
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST
GONNA PICK UP

06:35.463 --> 06:37.465
SOME LAME SWEATSHIRT
AT THE AIRPORT.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.600
THIS GIFT IS SO MUCH BETTER.

06:41.869 --> 06:46.106
NOW I CAN SAY THIS.
THIS IS A TRAVESTY.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.241
I SHOULD BE THE TRUSTEE.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.243
I AM VERONICA'S GRANDFATHER.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.245
I'M A RESPONSIBLE SURGEON.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.447
I HAVE
FULL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.583
YOUR IDEA OF MANAGING MONEY

06:55.583 --> 06:58.018
IS TAKING THE LOOSE CHANGE
FROM YOUR WORK PANTS

06:58.018 --> 07:02.122
AND BURYING IT IN COFFEE CANS
IN YOUR YARD.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.760
BURIED WHERE?

07:06.760 --> 07:11.431
IN THOSE DIRT PATCHES
WHERE THE GRASS DOESN'T GROW.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.167
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD KNOWS,
YOU IDIOT!

07:16.937 --> 07:20.107
GEORGE, CLAUDIA SENT YOU
A LETTER BEFORE SHE DIED.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.775
I JUST READ IT.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.545
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
READING MY LETTERS?

07:24.545 --> 07:26.547
I THOUGHT
MAYBE IT WOULD EXPLAIN

07:26.547 --> 07:28.248
WHY SHE DIDN'T PICK ME
AS THE TRUSTEE.

07:28.248 --> 07:32.452
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE SHE KNOWS
YOU OPEN OTHER PEOPLE'S MAIL.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.956
CLAUDIA WAS WORRIED.
HER DAUGHTER

07:35.956 --> 07:39.627
IS TOO IRRESPONSIBLE
TO HANDLE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

07:39.627 --> 07:42.195
SHE WANTS YOU TO WITHHOLD
THE INHERITANCE

07:42.195 --> 07:44.431
UNTIL YOU DECIDE
SHE'S RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.999
HOW DO I DO THAT?

07:45.999 --> 07:47.768
(mocking) "HOW DO I DO THAT?"
I DON'T KNOW.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.904
I WASN'T NAMED A TRUSTEE.
ANGIE, PLEASE.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.906
LOOK, I GOT A CHILD'S FUTURE
IN MY HANDS.

07:52.906 --> 07:56.076
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR YOUR TANTRUMS.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.445
YOU GUYS, I AM SO GLAD

07:58.445 --> 08:00.247
I CHANGED MY MIND
AND DECIDED

08:00.247 --> 08:03.116
TO COME BACK WITH YOU TO L.A.
I LOVE MY ROOM.

08:03.116 --> 08:06.620
I'M JUST GONNA NEED A FEW
MILLION DOLLARS TO REDECORATE.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.421
VERONICA, IT'S NOT
GONNA WORK LIKE THAT.

08:08.421 --> 08:11.859
YOUR MOM WANTED YOU TO PROVE
TO US YOU WERE MATURE ENOUGH.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.193
US?

08:16.096 --> 08:20.000
WAIT A MINUTE.
I DECIDE, OKAY, NOT YOU.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.235
I'M THE WINNER, ANGIE,
AND YOU'RE THE LOSER.

08:22.235 --> 08:28.609
SO YOU GOTTA LEARN
HOW TO LOSE... LOSER.

08:28.609 --> 08:32.012
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
IS MATURITY.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.282
WELL, IF ANYONE
CAN SPOT MATURITY,

08:35.282 --> 08:37.084
IT IS YOU, UNCLE GEORGE.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.853
YOU ARE THE ONLY SELF-MADE MAN
IN THIS FAMILY,

08:39.853 --> 08:43.290
AND I SO RESPECT YOU
FOR EVERYTHING. I THINK...
OKAY, TAKE IT EASY.
TRY TO RELAX.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.325
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET THE MONEY

08:45.325 --> 08:47.961
BY SUCKIN' UP TO ME, BECAUSE
I KNOW EVERY TRICK IN THE BOOK.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.097
MY OWN DAUGHTER
LIMPED AROUND FOR A MONTH

08:50.097 --> 08:53.000
BECAUSE SHE WANTED MONEY
FOR NEW SHOES.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.869
GEORGE,
SHE WAS PIGEON-TOED.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.140
WE HAD TO BUY HER SPECIAL
ORTHOPEDIC BOOTS.

09:00.140 --> 09:04.878
YES, ANGIE, BUT ON
MY SCHEDULE, OKAY? NOT HERS.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.320
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

09:13.320 --> 09:17.157
WELL, I THINK A SIGN OF MATURITY
IS CARING FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.292
SO I MADE BREAKFAST
FOR CARMEN AND MAX.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.896
THIS IS BY FAR

09:22.896 --> 09:25.899
THE BEST BOWL OF CEREAL
I'VE EVER HAD.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.501
VERONICA,
I LOVE THAT SWEATER.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.337
OH, I GOT IT IN MILAN.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.073
NO WAY. YOU GET TO SHOP
IN OTHER COUNTRIES?
(Veronica) MM-HMM.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.108
HEY, YOU GET TO SHOP
IN OTHER COUNTRIES, TOO, CARMEN.

09:35.108 --> 09:38.011
WHO TOOK YOU TO TIJUANA
TO BUY CLOTHES?

09:42.249 --> 09:43.350
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:43.350 --> 09:46.186
IF YOU LIKE THIS,
YOU CAN TOTALLY HAVE IT.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.156
I'VE ALREADY WORN IT,
LIKE, TWO TIMES.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.759
THANK YOU.

09:51.759 --> 09:55.162
YOU'RE WELCOME.
(laughs)

09:55.162 --> 09:59.299
SO WE'RE BARELY RELATED,
RIGHT?

09:59.299 --> 10:00.668
GO TO SCHOOL!

10:02.435 --> 10:04.638
VERONICA?

10:04.638 --> 10:05.706
YEAH?

10:05.706 --> 10:07.808
OH. OH.

10:07.808 --> 10:12.212
I'M GEORGE'S MOM, BENNY.
LOOK AT YOU.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.015
WHAT AN ANGEL
YOU TURNED OUT TO BE.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.950
(laughs)

10:16.950 --> 10:18.952
YOU KNOW,
YOU WERE SO YOUNG

10:18.952 --> 10:23.390
WHEN I PULLED YOU FROM THAT
BURNING CAR, YOU PROBABLY...

10:23.390 --> 10:25.225
DON'T EVEN REMEMBER ME.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.195
I DON'T REMEMBER
BEING IN A BURNING CAR.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.430
THANK GOD.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.165
I ASKED YOUR MOM
NOT TO TELL YOU

10:32.165 --> 10:34.802
BECAUSE I DID NOT
WANT YOU TO FEEL

10:34.802 --> 10:36.904
LIKE YOU OWED ME ANYTHING.

10:36.904 --> 10:39.072
I-I-I'M GONNA SIT DOWN NOW.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.908
MY SHOES
ARE ALL WORN OUT, AND...

10:40.908 --> 10:43.410
I CAN'T AFFORD NEW ONES.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.647
SHE HASN'T INHERITED
THE MONEY YET, MOM.

10:47.647 --> 10:52.786
MONEY? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

10:52.786 --> 10:55.288
HAS SOMETHING OCCURRED?

10:55.288 --> 10:58.425
WHAT ARE YOU BEING NICE
TO HER FOR?

10:58.425 --> 10:59.927
I'M THE TRUSTEE.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.496
GEORGE, GEORGE...

11:03.496 --> 11:06.566
GEORGE, YOU REMEMBER
HOW I USED TO HOLD YOU

11:06.566 --> 11:09.436
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY?

11:09.436 --> 11:12.605
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU WERE DRUNK
AND YOU HAD THE SPINS.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.274
BEAT IT, BENNY.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.810
SO I'VE BEEN THINKIN'
ABOUT WAYS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME

11:16.810 --> 11:18.812
YOU'RE MATURE ENOUGH
FOR THE MONEY.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.148
BUT, UNCLE GEORGE,
I'M ALREADY MATURE.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.516
I DATED A GUY IN HIS 40s
AND BROKE UP WITH HIM

11:23.516 --> 11:26.553
BECAUSE
HE WAS BEING CHILDISH.

11:26.553 --> 11:29.156
HERE ARE YOUR CHOICES--

11:29.156 --> 11:32.726
YOU CAN GO BACK TO COLLEGE,
OR YOU CAN GET A JOB.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.028
BUT I CAN'T GO BACK
TO MY OLD COLLEGE.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.530
THE 40-YEAR-OLD BOYFRIEND
WAS THE DEAN.

11:37.530 --> 11:41.168
SO...
KIND OF AWKWARD.

11:41.168 --> 11:44.504
WELL, THEN, I GUESS
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET A JOB.

11:44.504 --> 11:48.776
OKAY, FINE, I'LL GET A JOB,

11:48.776 --> 11:50.878
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO FOR MONEY

11:50.878 --> 11:52.179
UNTIL I GET
MY FIRST PAYCHECK?

11:52.179 --> 11:54.181
WELL,
SINCE SHE'S UNDER OUR ROOF,

11:54.181 --> 11:56.316
WE COULD GIVE HER AN ALLOWANCE
LIKE WE DO THE KIDS.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.219
THAT SOUNDS FAIR. MY MOM
USED TO GIVE ME AN ALLOWANCE.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.022
YEAH, HOW MUCH?
5 GRAND A MONTH.

12:02.022 --> 12:05.125
5 GRAND A MONTH?!
ESTÃ¡ LOCA, 5 GRAND A MONTH!

12:06.860 --> 12:09.729
I'LL GIVE YOU $40 A WEEK.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.065
TELL THAT 5 GRAND A MONTH
TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BUS.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.001
SEE IF THEY THINK IT'S FUNNY.

12:14.001 --> 12:19.239
$40? OH, MY GOD,
IS THIS A MATURITY TEST?

12:19.239 --> 12:22.242
YOU'RE TRYING TO SEE
IF I'LL CRY.

12:22.242 --> 12:27.114
(imitates crying)
YOU KNOW WHO CRIES? BABIES.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.222
MAN, I CAN'T IMAGINE
BEING VERONICA'S AGE

12:35.222 --> 12:37.224
AND GETTING
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE?

12:37.224 --> 12:40.060
I'D HAVE BOUGHT
A MANSION WITH A GROTTO

12:40.060 --> 12:41.862
AND LIVE LIKE A KING.
IT'D BE DARK,

12:41.862 --> 12:44.965
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
YOU'D HEAR... (chirps)
OH, YEAH.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.801
AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN
BROKE IN A YEAR.

12:47.801 --> 12:51.104
WE?

12:51.104 --> 12:54.774
THIS IS MY RICH GUY'S FANTASY.
ANGIE, WE'RE NOT MARRIED!

12:56.276 --> 12:58.545
I GOT ALL KINDS
OF SWEET CHICKS IN THE GROTTO.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.547
(both laugh)
"WE."

13:00.547 --> 13:02.349
HEY, THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
ANGIE.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.185
THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE
FOR YOU IN MY GROTTO.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.523
YEAH, IF SHE FITS,
"HUGE" HEFNER.

13:10.523 --> 13:13.460
WE'RE BACK.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.897
SO HOW DID THE JOB HUNT
AT THE MALL GO?

13:16.897 --> 13:18.899
WELL, I APPLIED
AT A BUNCH OF BOUTIQUES,

13:18.899 --> 13:20.700
AND I THINK I'VE GOT
A REALLY GOOD SHOT.

13:20.700 --> 13:24.404
TWO OF THE MANAGERS ASKED
ME OUT. ONE OF THEM WAS A GIRL.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.509
IT WAS AWESOME.

13:32.445 --> 13:36.183
HI. I'M ERNIE.
NICE TO MEET YOU!

13:37.684 --> 13:41.154
HEY, ALOOF. (chuckles)

13:41.154 --> 13:43.423
I LIKE IT.
SO THAT'S OKAY.

13:43.423 --> 13:46.826
I'M GONNA BE BACK TOMORROW
TO CLOSE THE DEAL. (laughs)

13:48.528 --> 13:49.496
WHAT DEAL?

13:49.496 --> 13:50.563
SHUT UP.

13:55.802 --> 13:59.439
MAX... (sniffs)
ARE YOU WEARING PERFUME?

13:59.439 --> 14:00.607
NO.

14:00.607 --> 14:04.444
(sniffs) IT'S COMING
FROM HIS BACKPACK.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.445
I GOT HOMEWORK.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.481
YEAH? NOW YOU GOT
HOMEWORK, HUH?

14:08.481 --> 14:12.385
IT'S A BROKEN PERFUME BOTTLE,
EARRINGS...

14:12.385 --> 14:14.621
AND WOMEN'S UNDERWEAR.
(gasps)

14:14.621 --> 14:17.357
DAD, I CAN EXPLAIN.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.426
NO, MAX. YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S OKAY.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.129
WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THIS DAY COMING WHEN HE STARTED

14:22.129 --> 14:24.631
TO LINE UP HIS ARMY MEN
IN A CHORUS LINE.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.302
MAX, WHAT IS GOING ON?

14:29.302 --> 14:32.005
THEY'RE VERONICA'S.
SHE BOUGHT THEM.

14:32.005 --> 14:36.709
REALLY? WHY ARE
THE SECURITY TAGS STILL ON?

14:36.709 --> 14:39.079
VERONICA!

14:39.079 --> 14:42.515
MAX, DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN
GO TO JAIL FOR SHOPLIFTING?

14:42.515 --> 14:45.052
I DON'T CARE.
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR VERONICA.

14:45.052 --> 14:48.255
I LOVE HER.

14:48.255 --> 14:52.725
MAX, SHE'S YOUR FIRST COUSIN,
AND YOU HAVE DYSLEXIA.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.162
IF YOU HAVE KIDS WITH HER,
YOUR MOM AND I WILL HAVE

14:55.162 --> 14:58.932
TO PAY $1 TO VISIT
OUR GRANDKIDS AT THE CARNIVAL.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.408
HOW COULD YOU DRAG OUR SON
INTO SHOPLIFTING?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.443
AND HOW COULD YOU SHOPLIFT
SEXY UNDERWEAR

15:10.443 --> 15:13.613
THAT ARE ANGIE'S SIZE?
KEEP THESE...

15:15.482 --> 15:18.451
WHEN YOU KNOW I'M TRYIN' TO
FIGURE OUT HOW MATURE YOU ARE?

15:18.451 --> 15:22.022
YEAH, WELL, YOU ONLY GAVE ME
$40 TO LIVE ON.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.657
HOW ELSE AM I SUPPOSED
TO GET NICE THINGS?

15:24.657 --> 15:27.427
GET A DAMN JOB!

15:27.427 --> 15:30.630
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
BECAUSE YOU'RE POOR.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.468
OH, NO, SHE DIDN'T!

15:36.736 --> 15:38.938
LOOK, I'M NOT POOR.
I OWN MY OWN HOUSE,

15:38.938 --> 15:40.440
I HAVE THREE CARS,

15:40.440 --> 15:42.942
AND I HAVE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS
IN CHANGE

15:42.942 --> 15:46.413
BURIED SOMEWHERE
ON THIS PROPERTY.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.214
(sighs)

15:47.214 --> 15:48.715
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.617
OUT.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.818
(door slams)

15:51.818 --> 15:54.454
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T NEED THIS, ANGIE.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.756
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER AGREED
TO BE HER TRUSTEE.

15:56.756 --> 16:00.327
HONEY, YOU ARE GONNA
BE HAPPY YOU DID THIS.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.694
WHY?

16:01.694 --> 16:03.696
YOU'RE GONNA GET
THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING

16:03.696 --> 16:07.434
YOU HELPED A YOUNG WOMAN
TURN HER LIFE AROUND.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.436
YOU SEE?
A SECOND OF TALK,

16:09.436 --> 16:12.172
THAT KEEPS YOU
OUT OF THE GROTTO...

16:12.172 --> 16:14.474
BECAUSE YOU'RE MORE
THAN QUALIFIED

16:14.474 --> 16:16.076
WITH YOUR WAAPAHH!

16:16.076 --> 16:18.978
BUT THIS--
I CAN'T LIVE WITH IT. NOPE.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.016
(knocking on door)

16:23.016 --> 16:25.085
(laughter)

16:29.089 --> 16:33.260
I LOST MY KEY.
(laughs)

16:33.260 --> 16:35.262
IT'S 2:00 IN THE MORNING.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

16:35.262 --> 16:40.633
OH, THESE ARE MY FRIENDS
I MET AT THE CLUB. WHOO!

16:40.633 --> 16:42.735
WE WALKED HOME.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.371
WHY DIDN'T
YOU GET A CAB?

16:44.371 --> 16:46.673
I SPENT ALL MY ALLOWANCE.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.675
ON WHAT?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.710
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.

16:50.710 --> 16:57.050
I'M KIND OF LIKE THESE CHIPS--
BAKED. (laughs)

16:57.050 --> 17:00.553
YOU USED YOUR ALLOWANCE
TO GET HIGH?

17:02.455 --> 17:07.460
IS IT ME, OR HAVE WE BEEN
TALKING FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR?

17:07.460 --> 17:09.396
NOW LOOK, NO ONE
IN THIS HOUSE USES DRUGS.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.398
IF WE WANNA
ESCAPE OUR PROBLEMS,

17:11.398 --> 17:13.333
THE KIDS WATCH TV,
AND I PLAY GOLF, AND...

17:13.333 --> 17:16.769
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANGIE DOES,
BECAUSE I PLAY GOLF.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.972
OH, MY GOD.
IF YOU'RE GONNA KEEP YELLING,

17:19.972 --> 17:23.843
I'M GONNA NEED
ANOTHER FATTIE.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.613
WHAT'S A FATTIE?

17:26.613 --> 17:29.116
ONE OF ERNIE'S GIRLFRIENDS.
NOW GO TO BED.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.586
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.855
LOOK, I DON'T WANT MY KIDS
EXPOSED TO THIS.

17:35.855 --> 17:39.826
SO TOMORROW MORNING,
I WANT YOU OUTTA HERE.
WHOA, AND WHAT ABOUT
MY MONEY?

17:39.826 --> 17:42.395
YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL, BECAUSE
I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.497
(gasps) I GOT MY MONEY!

17:44.497 --> 17:49.102
THIS IS AWESOME! I'M RICH!
(gasps) AND I HAVE CHIPS.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.574
NOW YOU'RE JUST RICH.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.647
GEORGE...

18:00.647 --> 18:03.183
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO GET OFF MY CHEST.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.852
65 YEARS OF CUBAN HAIR?

18:07.620 --> 18:10.457
THE HEDGE TRIMMER'S OVER THERE.
RINSE IT OFF WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

18:10.457 --> 18:13.493
ANGIE TOLD ME THAT YOU'RE
GIVING VERONICA HER MONEY

18:13.493 --> 18:15.495
AND SENDING HER
OUT ON HER OWN.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.964
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
IT'LL DESTROY HER.

18:17.964 --> 18:21.100
HEY, NOT MY KID,
NOT MY PROBLEM.
NO, NO, LISTEN TO ME.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.570
GROWING UP IN CUBA,
I HAD NOTHING.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.339
SO WHEN I BECAME
A WEALTHY MAN...

18:26.339 --> 18:28.541
I SPOILED MY CHILDREN.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.577
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
ANGIE TURNED OUT FINE.

18:30.577 --> 18:34.181
THAT WAS A MIRACLE,
BUT I RUINED MY SON.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.649
I GAVE HIM
EVERYTHING HE WANTED,

18:36.649 --> 18:38.918
AND IT MADE HIM
A HORRIBLE PERSON,

18:38.918 --> 18:41.888
AND CLAUDIA DID NOT WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN TO VERONICA,

18:41.888 --> 18:44.724
AND THAT'S WHY
SHE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE

18:44.724 --> 18:46.493
AND PICKED YOU.

18:46.493 --> 18:50.497
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
I'M A BETTER FATHER THAN YOU?

18:50.497 --> 18:54.234
AH, AH!
NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

18:54.234 --> 18:57.504
VIC, IT'S JUST US, MAN.
IF THIS WERE REVERSED,

18:57.504 --> 19:00.673
I'D LIKE TO THINK I'D BE
MAN ENOUGH TO ADMIT IT TO YOU.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.643
(sighs) FINE.

19:03.643 --> 19:07.747
GEORGE, YOU ARE
A BETTER FATHER THAN ME.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.516
AH, GOT YOU!

19:11.017 --> 19:14.821
(Vic on phone) GEORGE, YOU ARE
A BETTER FATHER THAN ME.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.490
I GOT MY NEW RINGTONE!

19:20.660 --> 19:23.129
REMEMBER WHEN
VERONICA WAS YOUNGER?

19:23.129 --> 19:24.697
SHE WAS A GOOD KID.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.633
PFFT.
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.635
WELL, THAT KID
IS IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.438
SO PLEASE
SAVE MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

19:43.216 --> 19:48.255
SO...
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.957
I GUESS I'LL JUST
TAKE MY CHECK NOW.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.393
I'LL GIVE YOU CASH.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.429
YOU HAVE IT IN CASH?

19:56.429 --> 19:58.265
NO WAY!
(laughs)

19:58.265 --> 20:00.867
THERE YOU GO.
(laughs)

20:02.168 --> 20:03.936
40 BUCKS?

20:03.936 --> 20:05.638
YEAH, THAT'S YOUR ALLOWANCE
FOR NEXT WEEK.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.274
OH, AND YOU HAVE CHORES
TO DO, TOO,

20:07.274 --> 20:09.276
STARTING WITH
GETTING GROCERIES,

20:09.276 --> 20:11.278
BECAUSE, UH,
WE NEED MORE CHIPS...

20:12.712 --> 20:16.649
AND YOU KNOW THE KIND I LIKE...
(imitates Veronica) THE BAKED.

20:16.649 --> 20:20.620
NO WAY.
I AM NOT STAYING HERE.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.522
YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
GIVING ME MY INHERITANCE!

20:22.522 --> 20:24.524
I CHANGED MY MIND!
YOU THINK I'M GONNA

20:24.524 --> 20:27.126
GIVE YOU MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
SO YOU CAN SCREW UP YOUR LIFE?
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

20:27.126 --> 20:29.262
WHAT, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE MY DAD?

20:29.262 --> 20:31.698
HEY, LOOK, I'M THE CLOSEST THING
YOU GOT, OKAY? LOOK, I KNOW

20:31.698 --> 20:34.401
YOU DON'T WANNA HEAR THIS,
BUT THIS IS WHAT DADS SAY--

20:34.401 --> 20:36.068
SOMEDAY,
YOU'LL THANK ME FOR THIS.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.438
THIS IS SO UNFAIR!

20:38.438 --> 20:40.940
OH, I KNOW THE ANSWER
TO THAT ONE, TOO. WATCH OUT.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.843
WHO SAID LIFE WAS FAIR?

20:45.512 --> 20:48.715
I HATE YOU! (screams)

20:51.584 --> 20:53.953
OH, YOUR FIRST "I HATE YOU."

20:53.953 --> 20:58.425
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY!

20:58.425 --> 21:02.795
THAT WAS A GREAT THING
YOU JUST DID.

21:02.795 --> 21:06.666
(Vic) GEORGE, YOU ARE
A BETTER FATHER THAN ME.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.669
WHAT WAS THAT?
THAT'S MY NEW RINGTONE.

21:09.669 --> 21:15.875
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU ARE A GREAT FATHER.

21:17.243 --> 21:18.778
OH, DAMN, IT'S MAX.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.414
I FORGOT TO PICK HIM UP
AT THE MOVIES!

21:23.182 --> 21:24.083
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
GO GET HIM.
