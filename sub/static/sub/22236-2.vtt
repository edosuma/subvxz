00:01.402 --> 00:05.162
Good morning, bushwalkers.
Ready to leave your comfort zones?

00:05.163 --> 00:09.174
I have preselected the groups, so don't
expect to be with any of your friends.

00:09.203 --> 00:12.401
She freaks me out,
the witch lady.

00:12.402 --> 00:14.693
If you want to win so much,
there's a short cut.

00:14.693 --> 00:16.324
Short cut to where?

00:16.803 --> 00:18.284
He's slipping!

00:20.515 --> 00:23.384
- You lost the map?
- Cooee!

00:24.529 --> 00:26.096
This way!

00:26.097 --> 00:29.041
Not everything out here
is easily explained.

00:29.042 --> 00:31.038
Where's the cameras
and the newspapers?

00:31.039 --> 00:33.810
Does our disappearances
and miraculous reappearance

00:33.811 --> 00:35.287
seem a bit like
a non-event to you?

00:35.288 --> 00:37.944
Hi, Oskie.
How did it go at the doctor's?

00:38.005 --> 00:40.902
- What's your problem?
- You can stand!

00:40.903 --> 00:43.599
How do you know my name?
Who are you?

02:01.003 --> 02:04.883
Oh, Jakie.
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

02:04.884 --> 02:08.479
I made your favourite -
bacon, lettuce and tomato.

02:08.749 --> 02:10.471
Won't you be late?

02:10.472 --> 02:12.955
Dad called, he's gonna
drive me to the game.

02:13.597 --> 02:15.080
Really.

02:15.748 --> 02:19.075
- I ironed a fresh uniform for you.
- You are my rock.

02:22.569 --> 02:24.776
Can't you give up
just one of those shifts?

02:24.810 --> 02:26.243
You look so wrecked.

02:26.244 --> 02:29.093
Jake, I just want to get us
out of this house,

02:29.094 --> 02:32.522
into a proper place,
you know, something big.

02:33.055 --> 02:36.835
Get us a car to hoon around in,
hey?

02:37.400 --> 02:42.601
- I am so lucky to have you.
- We're both lucky, Mum.

02:43.083 --> 02:45.163
(Knocking on screen door)

02:52.323 --> 02:55.802
Jake, son.
Jeez, you look well.

02:55.803 --> 02:57.363
Yeah, you too.

02:57.364 --> 02:58.954
Hang on a sec, mate.
Your mum home?

02:58.955 --> 03:00.398
Um... yeah.

03:00.423 --> 03:02.106
Sarah?

03:04.725 --> 03:07.285
Oh, listen, I...

03:08.031 --> 03:11.374
Is there any chance you might lend me
100 or so for the week?

03:11.375 --> 03:12.637
You're kidding...

03:12.638 --> 03:16.334
Dad, where's the car?

03:17.285 --> 03:20.172
Ah... Yeah, mate.

03:20.182 --> 03:23.420
Sorry. A bit of trouble
on the home front.

03:23.775 --> 03:27.112
Long story short,
no car this week.

03:27.113 --> 03:28.993
Got the trusty bike, though.

03:29.072 --> 03:32.309
You were gonna drive me
to the game, remember?

03:33.406 --> 03:36.345
Every time.
I'm such an idiot!

03:37.047 --> 03:38.920
Don't give him a cent.

03:39.532 --> 03:42.252
Jake, wait! I can dink you.

03:42.372 --> 03:44.564
Come on, mate!
Wait...

04:17.677 --> 04:19.397
Mum...!

04:51.270 --> 04:53.270
(Clattering)

04:55.135 --> 04:56.615
Hello...?

04:57.337 --> 04:59.049
<i>Who's that?</i>

05:19.532 --> 05:21.452
(Phone rings)

05:32.089 --> 05:33.729
Mum...

05:33.730 --> 05:36.726
<i>Hello? How are you, mate?</i>

05:36.809 --> 05:38.169
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:45.049 --> 05:46.529
(Video-game effects)

05:46.649 --> 05:48.312
Telly.

05:48.479 --> 05:51.321
Hey, Telly, you seen my mum?

05:51.369 --> 05:53.209
- Who?
- My mum.

05:53.210 --> 05:56.370
How am I supposed to
know your mum? Who are you?

05:56.371 --> 05:59.142
Come on. Quit playing games, mate.
Who's in our house?

05:59.143 --> 06:00.472
What?!

06:00.473 --> 06:03.473
- Whose stuff is that in there?
- You're crazy.

06:04.259 --> 06:05.498
Give it back!

06:05.509 --> 06:07.795
Lemme use it for a second.
I need to call my mum.

06:07.796 --> 06:09.579
Give me my phone.

06:10.063 --> 06:12.623
RECORDING: <i>The number you have
dialled is not connected.</i>

06:12.624 --> 06:14.064
Give me my phone!

06:14.491 --> 06:17.512
Will you stop sooking?
Do you know where she is or not?

06:21.314 --> 06:23.474
Give it back! Stop!

06:23.475 --> 06:27.697
I'll bring it back later.
And tell my mum I'm looking for her.

06:39.409 --> 06:42.889
(Sports commentary on game)

06:48.508 --> 06:52.183
Woo! And the crowd goes crazy
as he returns from the wild.

06:52.184 --> 06:54.928
- Keep it down!
- Really?

06:54.929 --> 06:56.955
Is that all you have to say?
I'm back.

06:56.956 --> 06:59.076
- So we smell, man.
- Back from where?

06:59.077 --> 07:01.317
Yes!

07:03.490 --> 07:06.008
It was pretty much
the worst night of my life.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.369
Man, I've never been
so hungry.

07:10.155 --> 07:11.757
So where's Mum and Dad?

07:11.758 --> 07:13.986
- Training, probably.
- Dude, you've got food! Where's mine?

07:13.993 --> 07:16.969
Get it yourself!
Isn't Mum freaking out?

07:16.970 --> 07:18.410
About what?

07:18.411 --> 07:20.425
- My disappearance.
- What?

07:20.570 --> 07:23.180
Come on. I just need to know
if there were tears or not.

07:23.205 --> 07:24.451
Sammy, shut your hole!

07:24.452 --> 07:26.830
Hey, come on! Don't call me that.
You know I hate that!

07:26.855 --> 07:28.251
What...?

07:30.529 --> 07:32.579
(Speaks indistinctly)

07:38.449 --> 07:41.689
- BOTH: What?!
- I'll kill you, Sammy!

07:41.809 --> 07:44.489
Kill me? What for?

07:45.489 --> 07:47.089
You were just there.

07:49.049 --> 07:51.049
(Eerie voice)

07:56.929 --> 07:59.834
I don't want to order anything.
I'm looking for Mum.

07:59.835 --> 08:04.815
- What did you say her name was?
- Sarah. Jim, she works here. Sarah.

08:04.816 --> 08:07.443
I've never seen a Sarah.
We've got a Sue.

08:07.475 --> 08:09.895
I don't reckon she's your mum,
though. She 18.

08:09.896 --> 08:13.725
- She's here every day.
- Kid, I don't know what you're on about.

08:13.726 --> 08:16.882
Unless you want
to order something, on your bike.

08:40.289 --> 08:41.621
But she is missing.

08:41.623 --> 08:44.334
Back up. You just told me YOU
went missing, in the bush.

08:44.335 --> 08:45.250
Yes.

08:45.254 --> 08:47.429
But now you're not, and
instead your mum's gone.

08:47.430 --> 08:49.808
You sure she didn't
just go out somewhere?

08:49.834 --> 08:52.226
- Women do that, you know.
- None of our stuff is there.

08:52.252 --> 08:54.488
And she'd never disappear
without letting me know.

08:54.489 --> 08:57.569
Why is this so hard to understand?
I need to find my Mum.

08:57.570 --> 09:01.017
- You're the cops. This is your thing.
- Okay. Calm down.

09:01.051 --> 09:02.731
Let's start with her name.

09:02.836 --> 09:04.791
I'll check to see
if there's any admissions.

09:04.816 --> 09:08.169
- Admissions where?
- Hospital or...

09:09.064 --> 09:10.789
Sarah Ryles.

09:11.186 --> 09:13.925
- Sarah Ryles?
- Yes, that's her name.

09:13.926 --> 09:18.194
- Any connection to Gary Ryles?
- Yeah, they were married. He's my dad.

09:18.829 --> 09:20.499
Don't move.

09:25.770 --> 09:27.330
Hey, boss?

09:27.435 --> 09:31.325
There's this crazy kid here claiming
that Sarah Ryles is his mum.

09:31.326 --> 09:34.052
His missing mum,
and that you're his dad.

09:34.053 --> 09:35.278
What?

09:36.370 --> 09:39.810
Hey, you think we should get in
Child Services? He's kinda upset.

09:39.963 --> 09:42.197
Or I could just throw him
in the lock-up.

09:42.797 --> 09:44.481
I'll talk to him.

09:56.663 --> 09:59.437
- He was pretty convincing.
- Mm-hm.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.397
Jake! Jake, wait!

10:06.454 --> 10:07.940
Please!

10:09.924 --> 10:12.965
- Am I glad I found you.
- What do you want? I'm busy.

10:12.966 --> 10:15.926
Is there a biomechanical
advantage to such a small bike?

10:16.086 --> 10:18.954
- This isn't a good time.
- Wait! Where are you going?

10:19.376 --> 10:22.926
To work out what the hell happened
to my life while you freaks got me lost.

10:22.927 --> 10:24.717
- What's happened?
- Just let me alone.

10:24.743 --> 10:27.405
- Don't you have a home to go to?
- That's the problem.

10:27.717 --> 10:29.482
I'm not sure I do.

10:30.048 --> 10:32.328
<i>I didn't notice anything
when I first walked in.</i>

10:32.629 --> 10:35.886
<i>I thought I was gonna get into trouble
for not coming home last night.</i>

10:35.887 --> 10:39.187
Viv! What have you done
to the inner sanctum?

10:41.179 --> 10:43.979
(Screams)
What are you doing in my room?!

10:43.980 --> 10:46.529
- YOUR room? I was only gone one night.
- What?!

10:46.530 --> 10:49.569
- What are you wearing?
- Get out, you creep!

10:50.480 --> 10:52.315
Are you insane?

10:52.532 --> 10:55.132
(Yells indistinctly) Nai-Nai!

10:55.526 --> 10:58.446
Oh, my God!
Get out, you pervert!

10:58.566 --> 11:00.363
<i>Nai-Nai!</i>

11:00.388 --> 11:02.685
(Screams)

11:03.680 --> 11:05.886
I didn't mean it!
Some weird kid got us lost.

11:05.887 --> 11:08.685
Get out, thief!
I beat you!

11:08.686 --> 11:10.344
<i>They were totally delusional.</i>

11:10.352 --> 11:15.366
That's nothing new for my sister,
but my nonna? It makes no sense.

11:15.526 --> 11:19.019
I don't think they recognised me.
At all.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.486
Yeah, it's a sad story, bro.
Heartbreaking.

11:21.527 --> 11:23.502
What, so everything's normal for you?

11:23.503 --> 11:25.721
Look, I've just got to find
my mum. Alright?

11:25.725 --> 11:29.331
Something's happened, hasn't it?
While we were lost in the bush.

11:29.332 --> 11:31.076
Touch me again
and something WILL happen.

11:31.077 --> 11:34.348
It's not just Andy.
Something happened to me too.

11:36.424 --> 11:37.784
Mum, Dad!

11:39.157 --> 11:40.566
Hey, Dad.

11:42.258 --> 11:43.492
Can I help you?

11:43.612 --> 11:44.972
Dad...?

11:46.092 --> 11:49.561
- You've got me confused, mate.
- Come on, this isn't funny.

11:49.612 --> 11:52.812
Why isn't anyone freaking out?
Is Mum OK?

11:52.932 --> 11:54.412
What do you want, kid?

11:54.532 --> 11:57.252
Mum! Mum, are you OK?

11:57.253 --> 12:00.573
Look, that's enough, yeah?
Just... Run along, would you?

12:00.852 --> 12:03.452
<i>Dee! Are you alright?</i>

12:05.412 --> 12:10.364
I lost my breath. It's kind of weird.
Who's that boy?

12:10.488 --> 12:13.098
- They had no idea who you were?
- None.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.000
What about you, Jake?

12:15.160 --> 12:17.760
Leave me out of this.
You guys are cracked.

12:17.761 --> 12:20.777
- Something's wrong, isn't it.
- Look, someone's living in my house.

12:20.778 --> 12:22.574
OK? And my mum's
gone missing.

12:22.575 --> 12:26.080
So I don't need to listen to your nerd
fantasies, I just need to find her.

12:26.081 --> 12:27.202
Jake!

12:27.203 --> 12:31.278
There's a 70, maybe 80% probability
that when you do find her,

12:31.295 --> 12:33.375
she'll have no idea who you are.

12:33.495 --> 12:36.286
- Yeah, cheers.
- Wait!

12:36.476 --> 12:39.116
We'll help you find her.

12:50.055 --> 12:53.735
OK, Andy.
What do you think happened?

12:53.736 --> 12:56.856
My theory is,
while we were lost in the bush,

12:56.857 --> 12:59.555
our families experienced
mass delusional hysteria.

12:59.556 --> 13:03.332
- That makes no sense whatsoever.
- Delusions can take extreme forms.

13:03.333 --> 13:07.334
There was an entire village in southern
China where all the men thought their...

13:07.335 --> 13:10.187
- ...Had shrivelled away to nothing.
- Oh, man!

13:10.188 --> 13:13.016
In our case, it's taking the form
of collective amnesia.

13:13.017 --> 13:17.012
- Everyone who knows us has forgotten us.
- What about Felix?

13:17.013 --> 13:18.470
If it's happened to him,

13:18.471 --> 13:22.031
that's at least proof that the four of us
are somehow connected to this.

13:22.060 --> 13:24.361
Come on, Jake,
you owe us that much.

13:24.830 --> 13:26.077
Alright.

13:26.089 --> 13:29.289
- But where do we find him?
- Sleeping in a coffin somewhere?

13:29.290 --> 13:31.570
- I know where he lives.
- Really...?

13:31.631 --> 13:34.871
What? We used to egg his house
after a footie win.

13:34.872 --> 13:37.672
It's good luck.
Come on.

13:48.873 --> 13:50.393
How's that theory holding up?

13:50.394 --> 13:53.154
He doesn't exactly look
like he's having a bad day.

13:53.155 --> 13:54.555
Hey, guys.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.386
- You're home?
- Where else would I be?

13:57.387 --> 13:59.046
Everything... OK?

13:59.069 --> 14:02.108
Man, how good does it feel
to be home after last night?

14:02.109 --> 14:03.342
Yeah, about that...

14:03.343 --> 14:06.231
Well, I hope you like this.
It's one of Oscar's favourites.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.414
Friends of yours, Felix?

14:08.415 --> 14:10.962
Yeah, these are the guys that
helped me back from the bush.

14:10.963 --> 14:13.359
Sounds like an adventure, boys.
Can I get you anything else?

14:13.360 --> 14:15.794
- No. The fairy bread is great.
- Oh, man, I'm starving.

14:15.795 --> 14:18.884
- I haven't eaten since...
- You ate Roland's food in front of us?

14:18.885 --> 14:22.295
(Chuckles) That's right. Whoops.
And I had a chicken.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.521
Here.

14:24.329 --> 14:25.960
We've only got this
low-sugar stuff,

14:25.961 --> 14:28.386
so youse will have to drink
three times as much.

14:30.563 --> 14:33.003
- Thanks, Oscar.
- He's walking!

14:33.004 --> 14:36.772
- He shouldn't be walking.
- I know, my brain REALLY hurts.

14:37.475 --> 14:41.224
- Mum, did you make fairy bread?
- Yeah, you love it.

14:41.225 --> 14:42.585
Yeah, when I was six!

14:42.849 --> 14:46.049
More visitors.
Some of your new friends, Oscar.

14:46.050 --> 14:47.669
You make me sound like a loser.

14:47.670 --> 14:50.098
I'll leave you both to play
before I get into more trouble.

14:50.099 --> 14:51.923
I might have a lie-down.

14:52.020 --> 14:55.187
- So great.
- Oscar, I'll be back in a sec, OK.

14:55.188 --> 14:57.737
- Did you take your move?
- Yeah, just a pawn.

15:05.207 --> 15:08.289
- What are you guys doing here?
- Why is your brother walking?

15:08.290 --> 15:10.048
I know. It's crazy, right?

15:10.049 --> 15:12.910
- How is it possible? It's not.
- I know...

15:12.911 --> 15:16.668
- Felix, will you stay for dinner?
- Yeah. Thanks. I'd like that.

15:16.676 --> 15:18.768
Well, that's... wonderful.

15:18.769 --> 15:22.138
"Stay for dinner"?
Like you don't actually live here?

15:22.139 --> 15:25.819
- Of course I live here.
- But your mum called you, a new friend.

15:25.820 --> 15:28.060
They don't know who you are,
do they?

15:28.214 --> 15:29.671
Felix!

15:34.084 --> 15:36.652
I came home,
and it was like this.

15:41.289 --> 15:44.929
Oscar can walk, but my family
can't remember me.

15:45.700 --> 15:49.489
It's weird,
but my brother can walk!

15:49.490 --> 15:52.060
Oscar is definitely an X factor
in my theory.

15:52.061 --> 15:54.728
- What theory?
- Collective amnesia.

15:54.729 --> 15:57.729
Our families were so traumatised
by us going missing,

15:57.730 --> 15:59.587
that they had a short circuit.

15:59.588 --> 16:03.328
But your brother walking?
It doesn't fit at all.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.969
None of this is helping me
find my mum.

16:05.970 --> 16:07.810
- So... I'm out of here.
- Jake!

16:07.811 --> 16:11.291
You know, I can't believe I let you
brain-dead pack of losers into my head.

16:11.292 --> 16:12.938
Brain-dead? Seriously?

16:12.939 --> 16:15.179
- Where are you going?
- What do you think?

16:15.180 --> 16:17.723
What I should have been doing
all this time.

16:18.877 --> 16:20.164
Ellen!

16:21.197 --> 16:23.397
What is she wearing?

16:23.969 --> 16:25.257
Ellen!

16:27.397 --> 16:29.197
Do I know you?

16:29.656 --> 16:32.256
Oh, no. You too?

16:32.257 --> 16:33.737
Me too what?

16:34.760 --> 16:38.360
Sorry. My mistake.
You look like a friend.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.320
Well, I'm not.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.720
You sound like her too.

16:43.140 --> 16:45.480
Figures this misfit
would be one of your friends.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.280
I hate you too.

16:52.906 --> 16:54.622
Guys, I'm gonna...

16:55.143 --> 16:56.745
Maybe you should go.

16:56.778 --> 16:58.759
- We should stick together.
- Why?

16:58.760 --> 17:01.200
Whatever's going on
happened to all of us.

17:01.233 --> 17:02.633
Maybe it's because of us.

17:02.634 --> 17:05.196
When you can figure it out,
you know where to find me.

17:13.290 --> 17:17.058
Hey, I'm really sorry.
Mum's gone all sick and weird and...

17:17.154 --> 17:20.718
- We've had our dinner after all.
- Really? One more game.

17:20.719 --> 17:23.839
No, I really should be doing my homework,
but good meeting you.

17:23.839 --> 17:28.040
- Guess I'll see you around, maybe.
- Yeah, I'll see you...

17:28.386 --> 17:30.266
...Around.

17:46.623 --> 17:48.000
Guys!

18:07.955 --> 18:12.255
How can you just kick us out like that?
We told you Dad owes us rent money.

18:12.274 --> 18:14.363
I don't have the first idea
what you're talking about.

18:14.388 --> 18:17.929
Our house...? You can't just
give it to someone else.

18:18.016 --> 18:19.240
What house?

18:19.241 --> 18:22.160
Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about, you bully!

18:22.161 --> 18:24.721
Hey, you got a complaint,
you put it in writing.

18:24.722 --> 18:28.654
This isn't a complaint. I want my home
back, and where did my mum go?

18:28.655 --> 18:31.376
Sharon!
Sharon, call the cops, love.

18:31.377 --> 18:35.582
- Tell me what happened to my mum?
- I have no idea who your mum is!

18:36.351 --> 18:40.031
- This isn't over.
- I think it is!

18:40.097 --> 18:41.848
Bye, mate!

18:57.069 --> 18:58.741
Oh, sorry.

18:59.134 --> 19:01.334
(Sneezes)

19:02.345 --> 19:03.705
Mum...?

19:07.143 --> 19:08.803
Mum!

19:53.328 --> 19:54.815
Mum...

19:55.806 --> 19:57.246
Mum, it's me.

19:57.366 --> 19:58.726
Sorry?

19:58.846 --> 20:00.246
It's me.

20:00.698 --> 20:04.726
- You were following me, weren't you?
- It's Jake, your son...?

20:06.105 --> 20:09.947
(Gasps) I don't have a son.
Please, what do you want?

20:09.950 --> 20:12.703
Sarah, everything OK?

20:12.769 --> 20:16.161
- What are YOU doing here?
- How can we help you, son?

20:16.209 --> 20:17.968
I wouldn't use that word.

20:18.489 --> 20:19.929
Mum, what's wrong?

20:20.431 --> 20:23.592
Please! I'm not your mum.
Please.

20:23.593 --> 20:26.174
- Are you two married?
- Sarah, what's going on?

20:26.200 --> 20:28.111
- When did that happen?
- That's none of your business.

20:28.112 --> 20:29.756
- Who are you, anyway?
- I'm...

20:31.124 --> 20:32.764
I'm...

20:36.570 --> 20:38.204
I'm no-one.

20:39.369 --> 20:40.729
Sorry.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.965
- You OK?
- Yeah.

21:09.174 --> 21:11.054
Sorry, Telly.

21:33.824 --> 21:36.747
We have power and
network but...

21:38.302 --> 21:40.006
Still nothing.

21:40.969 --> 21:43.696
If I just get my hands on a phone
that works, I'll call...

21:43.697 --> 21:44.899
Who?

21:45.489 --> 21:48.569
Well, someone has to remember us.
(Stomach rumbles)

21:49.027 --> 21:51.408
I don't think that fairy bread
was enough.

21:51.409 --> 21:54.611
And it's only made me hungrier.
Do you think we'll starve to death...

21:54.665 --> 21:56.279
In our own town?

21:56.510 --> 21:59.328
Like those stories
you read in the papers...

21:59.329 --> 22:04.249
About old people who starve to death
and get half-eaten by their pets.

22:04.268 --> 22:06.628
You just default to cheerful,
don't you?

22:06.629 --> 22:10.174
There's an old apple tree out back
of the footie stand if you're desperate.

22:10.545 --> 22:14.834
- You alright?
- I'm sorry about before.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.715
Did she remember you?

22:18.466 --> 22:22.302
- Yeah, welcome to the club.
- My mum's got a whole new life...

22:22.303 --> 22:26.984
New job, new car, new hair,
and she's married to Bates.

22:26.985 --> 22:28.685
- Mr Bates?
- What? Whoa!

22:29.102 --> 22:31.289
And Felix's brother can walk.

22:31.409 --> 22:34.659
- It's not amnesia.
- So what's really going on?

22:34.686 --> 22:39.368
Dude, I'll tell you what's going on.
What's going on is I'm starving.

22:39.369 --> 22:42.089
We need to find something to eat
and somewhere to stay.

22:42.090 --> 22:44.129
I know this seems challenging, but...

22:44.131 --> 22:46.971
The one thing I've learned from
watching Bear Grylls is that...

22:46.972 --> 22:49.492
- No more, Andy. Shut up.
- Couldn't agree more.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.809
I know somewhere we can go.

22:52.969 --> 22:56.494
My brothers and I played ball
games here when we were kids.

23:00.014 --> 23:01.557
It's open.

23:12.984 --> 23:15.008
It used to look a lot better.

23:15.234 --> 23:18.289
It has potential.
Every gang needs a hideout.

23:18.290 --> 23:22.429
- We are not a gang.
- Technically we are, if you consider...

23:23.237 --> 23:24.550
OK, not a gang.

23:24.551 --> 23:26.869
We can clear this space
over here to eat...

23:26.986 --> 23:30.506
To eat. Has anybody else
got their phones?

23:32.170 --> 23:34.589
- Mine's out of juice.
- Same.

23:34.590 --> 23:37.401
- I've got mine on power-save mode.
- Nice one.

23:37.402 --> 23:39.162
Ow!

23:39.417 --> 23:42.191
- You know what'd make this even worse?
- What?

23:43.344 --> 23:46.146
- If I wasn't here.
- Good one, Dracula.

23:46.497 --> 23:49.625
<i>We've got shelter. So now we just
need a reliable source of food.</i>

23:49.626 --> 23:52.289
<i>There are plenty more things
in Bremin.</i>
