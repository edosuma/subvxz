02:03.956 --> 02:05.158
Harvey!

02:05.591 --> 02:06.894
- Harvey!
- <i>Harvey!</i>

02:07.727 --> 02:08.896
Harvey, come!

02:09.962 --> 02:10.864
Harvey!

02:12.365 --> 02:13.501
Come on back, baby.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.169
Harvey, come!

02:16.969 --> 02:18.338
<i>Har-vey!</i>

02:19.806 --> 02:20.907
Bret, these are those seeds

02:20.941 --> 02:23.811
that grow into the flowers
that like, smell amazing.

02:25.745 --> 02:27.247
Harvey!

02:28.949 --> 02:30.251
Harvey!

02:30.783 --> 02:31.651
Shit.

02:31.685 --> 02:32.920
I think he went in
somewhere over here,

02:32.953 --> 02:34.521
maybe if we split up
and go around,

02:34.554 --> 02:35.388
we circle,
split up and circle around?

02:35.421 --> 02:36.490
Well, sweetie,
he's gonna come back,

02:36.522 --> 02:38.792
- he always comes back.
- Alice could you focus? Jesus!

02:38.824 --> 02:40.259
- <i>Hey, Hey! Hey!</i>
- Harvey!

02:40.293 --> 02:41.228
<i>Git! Git!</i>

02:41.260 --> 02:42.662
- <i>Git out of there!</i>
- Harvey! Hey-hey-hey!

02:42.695 --> 02:43.597
- Stop, stop, stop. That's my dog.
- <i>Is this your fuckin' dog?</i>

02:43.629 --> 02:45.698
That's my dog!
That's my dog! He's sick!

02:45.731 --> 02:47.401
<i>He needs to stay out
of my fucking yard.</i>

02:47.433 --> 02:49.302
- Hey! Stop! Do not touch my dog!
- Bret!

02:49.336 --> 02:50.504
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Don't touch my dog.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.406
- <i>Hey, don't touch my fence!</i>
- Do not touch my dog!

02:52.438 --> 02:53.507
- <i>Don't touch my fence!</i>
- Bret!

02:53.539 --> 02:54.540
<i>You watch your dog better,</i>

02:54.574 --> 02:55.641
<i>he's running around
in my fucking plants!</i>

02:55.675 --> 02:56.943
- Do not touch my fucking dog, dude!
- <i>Hey!</i>

02:56.977 --> 02:58.945
<i>He steps on my plants one more
time I'm gonna fucking kill him.</i>

02:58.979 --> 03:00.080
Hey! Don't touch
my fucking dog, he's sick!

03:00.114 --> 03:01.615
- <i>Well then, get him out of my yard.</i>
- Stop it!

03:01.647 --> 03:02.848
Are you fucking crazy!
Hey!

03:02.882 --> 03:03.582
- Don't touch my...
- <i>Hey!</i>

03:03.616 --> 03:05.519
Don't! Touch!
My fucking dog!

03:17.597 --> 03:19.200
So good.

03:26.939 --> 03:28.808
That guy was really scary,
right?

03:28.842 --> 03:30.611
He was really crazy.

03:31.877 --> 03:33.680
- He was crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

03:34.681 --> 03:36.350
Harvey's back so we're good.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.387
Right?

03:41.655 --> 03:43.556
I think it's a good idea
to keep him on a leash

03:43.590 --> 03:44.724
when we're in these
neighborhoods

03:44.758 --> 03:48.362
'cause it doesn't seem like
people are so crazy about

03:48.395 --> 03:49.796
having a dog on their property.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.798
I don't want to keep him
on a leash though, he's a dog.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.966
I mean, he should be able
to sniff around and just...

03:54.000 --> 03:55.568
Just around here though,
right?

03:55.602 --> 03:57.337
I mean,
he's off the leash a lot.

03:57.371 --> 04:00.707
- We keep him off the leash like when we're at the lake...
- <i>Hey...</i>

04:00.740 --> 04:01.808
- <i>Yummy!</i>
- No, thank you.

04:01.841 --> 04:03.377
We're good, thank you.

04:03.676 --> 04:04.578
<i>Yummy.</i>

04:04.611 --> 04:05.412
He has a special diet
he can't eat that,

04:05.445 --> 04:07.313
I'm sorry, thank you.

04:07.347 --> 04:08.448
No, thank you!

04:10.350 --> 04:11.318
No, thank you!

04:12.384 --> 04:13.218
I'm sorry.

04:13.252 --> 04:15.588
God dammit.
What the fuck.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.494
Just take a breath.

04:22.961 --> 04:25.064
We'll give you something
nice at home, Harvey.

05:53.752 --> 05:55.055
<i>I'm breaking.</i>

05:56.523 --> 05:57.825
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

06:14.841 --> 06:16.944
Maybe I should take
Harvey out to pee.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.650
You wanna come?

06:23.682 --> 06:24.651
No, I'm cooking.

06:24.684 --> 06:26.119
Bret, why do you have to go?

06:26.151 --> 06:27.754
Come on, don't go.

06:28.788 --> 06:29.689
Stay.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.092
I'll be back in just a second.

06:33.692 --> 06:35.695
I'm just going to
take him out for a sec.

06:37.129 --> 06:39.832
The vet said he should
just do normal dog stuff.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.537
Look, he's ready.
You ready, Harvey?

06:44.504 --> 06:45.806
We'll be right back.

07:47.266 --> 07:49.469
<i>I love the way
you look at me...</i>

07:52.137 --> 07:54.240
<i>I love how patient you are...</i>

07:57.744 --> 08:00.147
<i>And that you never seem
to get mad at me...</i>

08:05.718 --> 08:07.688
I remember when
you were a baby.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.591
Do you remember that?

08:14.793 --> 08:16.529
You're still my baby.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.909
I'm sorry if I'm
letting you down.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.747
What do you want me to do?

08:36.950 --> 08:39.786
If you tell me,
I'll do it.

08:40.953 --> 08:43.623
I'll do whatever you say.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.293
Hello.
Oh hey, Bret.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.329
Where are you?

09:22.361 --> 09:24.197
Oh, I'm just walking
with Harvey.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.632
You know.

09:25.664 --> 09:27.733
It's only been like
twenty minutes or,

09:27.767 --> 09:28.902
an hour.

09:28.934 --> 09:29.635
Whatever.

09:29.668 --> 09:30.769
Fucking get back here,
please!

09:30.803 --> 09:33.305
Harvey won't die if you
leave him alone for ten minutes,

09:33.339 --> 09:34.875
he's a dog.

09:35.741 --> 09:40.246
Oh, so you really need me.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.849
Yeah! I do.

09:42.881 --> 09:44.850
I do really need you!

09:45.418 --> 09:47.153
- Tell me how you need me.
- <i>Tell me how you need me.</i>

09:52.291 --> 09:53.660
You know.

09:54.826 --> 09:59.099
Alice, lie the fuck down
and tell me how you need me.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.210
Okay.

10:11.910 --> 10:13.245
Okay, I'm lying down.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.115
<i>Good.</i>

10:16.249 --> 10:18.719
<i>Now tell me.
How hungry am I?</i>

10:21.988 --> 10:23.990
Like, you're starving like
you haven't eaten in weeks,

10:24.023 --> 10:26.393
and I'm the only thing
that can feed you.

10:27.994 --> 10:30.397
- Mmm, I could swallow you whole.
- <i>I could swallow you whole.</i>

10:31.364 --> 10:32.499
Please do that.

10:32.532 --> 10:35.402
- Or I could rip you up into little pieces...
- Pieces.

10:37.035 --> 10:38.371
Holy shit.

11:46.505 --> 11:47.874
<i>Harvey?</i>

11:49.808 --> 11:51.077
<i>Harv!</i>

11:53.546 --> 11:55.048
<i>Harvey!</i>

11:55.347 --> 11:56.015
Come on!

11:57.182 --> 11:58.384
Hey, boy.

11:59.217 --> 12:00.453
Harvey, come here.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.398
Just a second!

12:12.431 --> 12:14.234
<i>Okay, I'm running late
though, I gotta go.</i>

12:16.168 --> 12:17.437
- Hi!
- Good morning!

12:17.470 --> 12:18.939
- Hey, sleepy.
- Hey.

12:19.371 --> 12:20.372
Um.

12:20.405 --> 12:21.807
4p.m.?
At the vet?

12:21.841 --> 12:22.442
Yes.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.843
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:23.876 --> 12:27.112
- Maybe you want to set an alarm for yourself or something?
- It's 4pm,

12:27.145 --> 12:29.815
I will not sleep through it,
I promise.

12:29.849 --> 12:30.950
Okay.

12:30.982 --> 12:32.351
Mm-hmm.

12:32.384 --> 12:33.352
Alright.

12:33.385 --> 12:35.387
No, I don't need to set
an alarm for 4pm.

12:37.456 --> 12:38.959
I'll be there...

12:40.326 --> 12:41.293
I will be there.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.497
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:44.129 --> 12:46.198
- Alright I do have to run, but...
- I love you.

12:46.231 --> 12:47.399
I love you, too.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.969
- See ya.
- Okay.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.104
- <i>Have a good day!</i>
- You too!

13:13.091 --> 13:14.093
Okay, great.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.495
- Thank you!
- You're very welcome.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.197
Mm-hmm, we'll see you soon.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.298
- Have a great one, we'll see you soon.
- You too.

13:19.331 --> 13:20.432
Thank you.
Thank you.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.366
Thank you.

13:27.206 --> 13:28.341
Alice?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.211
Alice?

13:33.312 --> 13:35.347
- Hi!
- Hi. Here's my deposit.

13:36.381 --> 13:38.284
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.120
Here you go,

13:41.153 --> 13:43.288
- this will go to your bank account.
- Thank you.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.624
- Oh yeah!
- Thank you.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.559
- Yeah, bye-bye!
- Bye.

13:46.591 --> 13:48.294
- Have a great day.
- You too!

14:08.681 --> 14:11.117
Is your bedroom
a light-blue color?

14:11.984 --> 14:13.453
Or a dark-blue color?

14:16.455 --> 14:17.891
Yellow is the worst.

14:17.923 --> 14:20.125
You know, my mom
took a class on the internet

14:20.158 --> 14:23.028
about how to breath...

14:23.062 --> 14:24.898
...breath slow and deep,

14:24.931 --> 14:28.100
and now she can sleep
like all night.

14:28.134 --> 14:31.504
I mean, the TV can be on
or you can be like,

14:31.537 --> 14:33.572
yelling right in front
of her face!

14:33.605 --> 14:35.408
And she won't wake up.

14:36.207 --> 14:38.243
So, that's what you need to do.

14:38.277 --> 14:41.047
You need to like,
breath slow and deep

14:41.080 --> 14:44.117
and deep and slow
and deep.

14:44.149 --> 14:45.619
That's the key.

14:52.091 --> 14:53.158
Ur...

14:53.192 --> 14:55.028
I bet meat is your problem.

14:55.995 --> 14:57.429
Either you're eating a body

14:57.462 --> 15:00.299
or your body's waiting
to be eaten.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.468
And that's,
that's what your brain thinks.

15:04.971 --> 15:06.038
Fight or flight.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.341
Consume your adversaries.

15:13.578 --> 15:16.048
That's why the world
is going to eat you

15:16.081 --> 15:17.549
and not me.

15:27.293 --> 15:28.327
But!

15:28.360 --> 15:31.563
The most important thing,
is the cut of your meat.

15:31.596 --> 15:33.231
Marbling?!

15:33.264 --> 15:35.031
That's, that's where it's at.

16:48.673 --> 16:50.375
It's only like,
half an hour or an hour,

16:50.408 --> 16:51.644
it's not even a whole shift.

16:52.644 --> 16:54.780
You asked for overtime,
you got overtime.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.384
Yeah but I asked for overtime
for my dog

16:58.417 --> 16:59.552
and the appointment
is for my dog,

16:59.585 --> 17:01.153
it's the whole point.

17:09.795 --> 17:11.398
Nothing?

17:12.330 --> 17:13.231
I don't know what to tell 'ya.

17:13.265 --> 17:14.133
You know the policy.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.300
Two weeks advance notice

17:15.334 --> 17:17.103
if you want to make
a schedule change.

17:18.269 --> 17:19.605
Not the day of.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.142
It's not like
it's a rabies shot,

17:23.174 --> 17:24.543
my dog is really sick.

17:24.576 --> 17:26.112
He's dying.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.449
It's just one shift!

17:29.481 --> 17:31.384
Look.
I'm a Level-13 manager.

17:31.416 --> 17:33.351
I've been at this branch
for 6 years,

17:33.384 --> 17:34.353
and I'm taking out the garbage.

17:34.385 --> 17:36.489
So I don't really give a shit
about your dog.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.306
So does that mean, "no"?

18:03.883 --> 18:04.784
Asshole.

18:29.708 --> 18:30.743
Good news.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.746
Harvey's treatment is working.

18:33.778 --> 18:35.714
Even better than we expected.

18:39.684 --> 18:41.287
Yay!

18:44.557 --> 18:45.625
I'm so happy.

18:45.657 --> 18:49.261
Sorry.
That's ah, so much to take in.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.663
I'm so surprised.
Um...

18:51.696 --> 18:53.665
How long does he have to live?

18:53.699 --> 18:57.269
I mean, possibly a year.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.473
Two years isn't impossible.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.775
- Oh my god.
- I mean, he's doing really great.

19:02.807 --> 19:07.379
Okay, that's really...
um, great news.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.748
Yeah, yeah.

19:09.682 --> 19:10.682
Um.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.219
Does that mean we can stop
with the treatments?

19:13.885 --> 19:15.387
No, um,

19:15.421 --> 19:18.591
no, he's responding so well
to those actually

19:18.624 --> 19:21.627
we should consider
a more aggressive pace.

19:22.928 --> 19:25.965
So there's, like a bulk
discount for those?

19:25.998 --> 19:27.266
Or...

19:27.298 --> 19:30.235
Mmm, there is...

19:30.269 --> 19:32.371
...not, No.

19:32.403 --> 19:33.772
No.

19:34.373 --> 19:35.607
No.

19:35.773 --> 19:37.242
Okay.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.244
Uh...

19:40.412 --> 19:43.883
Okay, but let me walk you
through what the schedule's

19:43.915 --> 19:46.351
going to be like
for these treatments.

19:46.384 --> 19:48.487
We could get away

19:48.519 --> 19:50.889
with once every two weeks,

19:50.923 --> 19:54.527
but I think three times a month

19:54.559 --> 19:56.561
is worth a shot.

19:56.595 --> 19:57.596
I...

19:58.631 --> 20:00.365
I just thought of something.

20:00.398 --> 20:03.502
Um.
Harvey's been sleep-walking.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.772
He's been having a lot
of trouble sleeping.

20:06.805 --> 20:08.841
He's sleep-walking.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.644
His body's been doing
a lot of work...

20:13.778 --> 20:14.547
Sure.

20:14.579 --> 20:16.982
So then he started
sleep-walking.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.750
In and out of the house.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.821
- Right.
- Um, so,

20:22.855 --> 20:27.893
I guess, like you said it's his
body's been through a lot.

20:27.925 --> 20:31.496
Maybe the treatments are
a little too much for him,

20:31.529 --> 20:35.401
and it would be in the interest
of his quality of life

20:35.433 --> 20:36.935
to just...

20:39.771 --> 20:42.307
So, so, I'm not sure I follow.

20:42.340 --> 20:46.544
Oh, um,
I would be more humane.

20:46.577 --> 20:49.347
To just let him be a dog.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.617
And just let him...

20:51.650 --> 20:53.319
go...

20:54.019 --> 20:55.020
...out there.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.294
What does this have to do
with sleep-walking?

21:01.326 --> 21:03.328
Like, who's...
who's sleep-walking?

21:04.696 --> 21:05.897
Nobody.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.802
Um... But do you have
a prescription for it?

21:14.573 --> 21:15.574
No.

21:15.606 --> 21:18.911
No, that's not a thing.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.848
Okay.

21:25.116 --> 21:27.386
I'll just hold him close.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.689
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:29.721 --> 21:31.023
Okay.

22:06.924 --> 22:08.927
<i>I really have to hand
it to you, Harvey.</i>

22:08.961 --> 22:11.364
<i>You've really got this
whole thing figured out.</i>

22:18.903 --> 22:21.606
First you're sick
and then you're not sick.

22:22.907 --> 22:25.377
Then you're dying,

22:25.411 --> 22:27.447
now you're getting better.

22:33.919 --> 22:35.421
Go get the ball.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.069
What does Bret say to you?

23:00.746 --> 23:03.048
What's she always
talking to you about?

25:12.711 --> 25:13.880
<i>Hi.</i>

25:16.147 --> 25:18.049
<i>Harvey!</i>

25:19.984 --> 25:21.887
I'm sorry I missed
that appointment.

25:23.321 --> 25:25.023
Harvey!
Come!

25:25.757 --> 25:27.125
<i>Harv-vey!</i>

25:29.728 --> 25:31.197
<i>Harvey.</i>

25:31.596 --> 25:33.031
<i>Come on, boy!</i>

25:35.232 --> 25:37.036
<i>Harvey?</i>

25:38.135 --> 25:39.704
<i>There you are!</i>

25:39.738 --> 25:42.207
<i>Hi, Sweet-Pea.
How are you?</i>

25:42.240 --> 25:44.009
<i>I missed you.</i>

25:44.041 --> 25:46.578
<i>I missed you,
how was the doctor?</i>

25:47.144 --> 25:48.247
<i>Was it scary?</i>

25:48.779 --> 25:49.781
<i>Yeah?</i>

25:51.215 --> 25:52.584
<i>Yeah?</i>

25:53.884 --> 25:55.555
<i>You're mine now.
Come here.</i>

29:01.105 --> 29:02.273
<i>Harvey?</i>

29:05.442 --> 29:07.113
<i>Harvey.</i>

29:14.385 --> 29:15.887
Harvey!

29:17.355 --> 29:18.990
Harvey...

29:19.023 --> 29:20.458
<i>Harvey!</i>

29:22.326 --> 29:23.127
You shouldn't have
let him out,

29:23.161 --> 29:25.297
he should always be
inside with us.

29:25.329 --> 29:26.831
He has to be a dog.

29:26.865 --> 29:29.234
You said,
that he always has to be a dog.

29:30.999 --> 29:31.103
Harvey.

29:31.569 --> 29:33.038
Harvey!

29:42.513 --> 29:44.315
- Harvey?
- Harvey!

29:45.083 --> 29:47.052
- Harvey...
- Harvey!

30:10.474 --> 30:11.609
Stop.

30:11.643 --> 30:12.577
What?

30:12.611 --> 30:13.479
Stop the car!

30:13.511 --> 30:15.513
- Where do you want me to stop?
- Pull in.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.250
Why, you see him?

30:19.984 --> 30:21.319
Do you see him?

30:25.656 --> 30:26.858
What?!

30:27.192 --> 30:28.394
Um...

30:29.627 --> 30:31.996
- Did you see something?
- Harvey!

30:32.029 --> 30:33.531
- Let's play!
- Harvey!!

30:34.566 --> 30:35.567
Harvey!

30:35.601 --> 30:37.336
Can we keep looking?
This is driving me insane.

30:37.368 --> 30:39.337
- Yeah.
- What did you see, Alice?

30:39.371 --> 30:40.906
Yeah, I guess I...

30:40.939 --> 30:42.875
I don't know.

30:44.308 --> 30:46.144
This is a bad idea.
I don't know, I don't know.

30:46.176 --> 30:47.612
I'm sorry, we can go.

30:47.645 --> 30:49.480
We should keep
driving and looking.

30:51.249 --> 30:52.617
Oh my god.

30:53.984 --> 30:54.953
Oh my god!

30:55.653 --> 30:57.155
Alice, come here!

30:57.521 --> 30:58.957
Are you okay, sweetie?

31:01.358 --> 31:03.427
It's his ear.
It's Harvey's ear.

31:03.461 --> 31:04.896
Don't...
Look at that.

31:04.930 --> 31:05.965
- It's not Harvey's ear.
- That's not his ear.

31:05.998 --> 31:08.133
- Yes it is, it is Harvey's ear!
- Do not touch that!

31:09.433 --> 31:11.536
Come on, I will drive,
I will drive.

31:11.568 --> 31:13.638
Don't. Please!
Do not touch it.

31:15.307 --> 31:17.409
It's not Harvey's ear,
that's disgusting.

31:17.442 --> 31:18.442
Harvey...

31:18.476 --> 31:19.678
Oh my god.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.012
Oh, that's disgusting.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.080
I don't...
That's not Harvey's ear,

31:22.113 --> 31:22.980
don't touch that.

31:23.013 --> 31:24.248
That...
Do not touch it.

31:24.281 --> 31:25.317
Do not touch that!

31:25.349 --> 31:28.086
No-no-no-no, don't touch that,
don't touch that.

31:28.118 --> 31:29.520
I don't think
that's Harvey's ear.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.391
- It is his ear look at it!
- No, I... Don't touch it, it's bloody!

31:32.423 --> 31:33.525
Don't touch it.
Let's go.

31:33.557 --> 31:34.225
Come on!

31:34.259 --> 31:35.560
Harvey!

33:36.480 --> 33:38.282
<i>You don't call Animal Control.</i>

33:38.615 --> 33:40.419
<i>They just scoop up the dogs
and they kill 'em.</i>

33:40.451 --> 33:41.420
<i>Like, right there on the truck,</i>

33:41.452 --> 33:43.254
<i>they don't even take 'em
back to the pound.</i>

33:43.288 --> 33:45.356
Cause my dog often doesn't
come if I say, "Bubbles",

33:45.390 --> 33:48.593
I have to say "Bubbly-Boo!
Bubbly-Boo!",

33:48.625 --> 33:50.362
'cause that's what I call him
a lot so he thinks

33:50.394 --> 33:52.564
that's his name,
even though it's a nickname.

33:52.596 --> 33:55.133
Like, when the police are
trying to catch a murderer?

33:55.165 --> 33:58.269
And they give a, you know,
a reward for information,

33:58.303 --> 34:01.473
they get tons,
tons of fake phone calls.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.108
People want that reward.

34:03.141 --> 34:05.277
But if it's too small,
then people don't care

34:05.309 --> 34:07.413
so you gotta find
that sweet-spot like,

34:08.278 --> 34:10.315
thirty-seven dollars
and fifty cents.

34:10.347 --> 34:12.150
Boy dog or girl dog?

34:13.351 --> 34:14.553
I'm gonna guess boy dog.

34:14.585 --> 34:17.788
So you get a hot girl dog.
Like, smokin' hot.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.657
Like, the hottest
girl dog there is.

34:19.690 --> 34:22.159
Like, we're talkin' like,

34:22.193 --> 34:24.863
you know, super model.

34:24.896 --> 34:25.997
Super model girl dog.

34:26.030 --> 34:29.768
Like, if they had a Sports
Illustrated swimsuit issue

34:29.800 --> 34:31.503
for dogs?

34:31.536 --> 34:33.438
You get a girl dog
that would be in that.

34:33.471 --> 34:35.407
And then you go and you walk
her up and down the street

34:35.440 --> 34:37.476
and you call your dogs name,
Harvey,

34:37.509 --> 34:38.742
and you say,
"Harvey, come here,

34:38.775 --> 34:42.379
I got this swimsuit-dog,
swimsuit-model-dog",

34:42.413 --> 34:44.315
he'll come runnin'.

34:44.349 --> 34:45.217
In fact, no.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.552
You want your dog
to come home, right?

34:47.585 --> 34:48.353
So you get that girl dog

34:48.385 --> 34:50.221
and you rub her
all over the place

34:50.255 --> 34:51.756
like your fence,
your doorway,

34:51.789 --> 34:53.892
the doggy-door
so he comes back in.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.128
Get her pheromones all over,

34:56.161 --> 34:58.130
all over your house
all over your stuff...

35:50.514 --> 35:52.750
What if we try to get
something on the news.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.220
You know that place where
they're sometimes like,

35:55.253 --> 35:56.922
"Rizelda's 105 year's old!".

35:56.954 --> 35:58.489
They could just say...

35:58.523 --> 36:00.358
- Oh, like on the local news?
- Everybody...

36:00.391 --> 36:01.559
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

36:01.592 --> 36:04.628
Then everybody sees it
right before work.

36:04.661 --> 36:05.730
- I just, feel like I...
- Yeah.

36:05.762 --> 36:07.264
I've put up a lot of posters

36:07.297 --> 36:08.666
- but I don't...
- Mm-hmm.

36:08.699 --> 36:11.802
I can't obviously
get everywhere.

36:11.835 --> 36:13.304
Yeah. Yeah.

36:19.876 --> 36:22.447
Maybe you could ask
the weather lady

36:22.480 --> 36:24.282
who comes into the bank?

36:29.753 --> 36:32.289
I think I could get
in trouble for that.

36:32.322 --> 36:34.525
For talking to that lady?

36:34.559 --> 36:36.628
I mean, 'cause I'm bringing up
something personal

36:36.661 --> 36:40.432
that doesn't have anything to
do with her relationship to me.

36:40.465 --> 36:43.668
Yeah, it would be unusual but
these are unusual circumstances

36:43.701 --> 36:45.369
and I'm sure that
she would understand.

36:45.402 --> 36:46.937
But I'm not going
to risk my job

36:46.971 --> 36:49.306
by like bothering a client...

36:49.340 --> 36:51.343
You're not going to risk your
job by talking to some person

36:51.376 --> 36:52.611
who you're going to
be talking to anyway!?

36:52.643 --> 36:54.245
- Just asking them?
- What's going on?

36:54.278 --> 36:56.514
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to find my dog!

36:56.547 --> 36:57.447
You aren't helping me!

36:57.481 --> 36:59.516
If he's coming back,
he's coming back.

36:59.550 --> 37:00.986
And we've checked
every shelter.

37:01.018 --> 37:03.754
And you've put up...
This is a substantial reward.

37:03.788 --> 37:05.590
Nobody has called.

37:05.623 --> 37:07.726
We have some many friends that
have been on the lookout for him

37:07.759 --> 37:08.659
this whole time.

37:08.693 --> 37:10.762
Why are you fighting me
on everything?

37:10.795 --> 37:14.331
- I'm not gonna ask a client at the bank!
- Alright.

37:14.364 --> 37:16.300
Just give up right here.

37:16.333 --> 37:19.937
I won't make any more effort
to find my dog -

37:19.971 --> 37:23.407
who I've had
for two years longer

37:23.440 --> 37:24.509
than I've even known you.

37:24.541 --> 37:26.610
I'll just...
I won't look anymore.

37:26.643 --> 37:28.412
I won't do anything anymore.

37:28.445 --> 37:29.681
I won't try anything.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.608
You sure about the ear?

38:06.451 --> 38:08.653
I just feel like we need
to bury something.

38:17.362 --> 38:20.398
Maybe we should get some
meat from the supermarket?

38:25.769 --> 38:28.507
I mean, those animals
deserve something, too.

38:45.623 --> 38:47.726
Seems like a waste of a hole.

40:49.079 --> 40:51.115
<i>I love your pretty mouth.</i>

40:54.085 --> 40:55.787
<i>I love your wrists.</i>

40:58.155 --> 40:59.858
I love the shadow...

41:00.690 --> 41:02.726
here at the bottom
of your neck.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.634
Um...

41:10.568 --> 41:12.003
I don't get it.

41:13.538 --> 41:14.639
I don't.
I'm sorry.

41:14.672 --> 41:16.074
I don't like, I don't...

41:16.106 --> 41:18.943
I get it. Bit when...

41:20.777 --> 41:21.879
When do you fuck?

41:21.913 --> 41:23.248
You know what I mean?

41:23.780 --> 41:25.483
When's like, the next...

41:26.284 --> 41:28.720
- I just want to make sure we do have sex.
- Yeah.

41:30.153 --> 41:33.090
- I don't like asking for that but.
- Yeah, I think this part

41:33.123 --> 41:36.627
is just,
an intimacy thing?

41:37.228 --> 41:38.697
- So...
- Yeah.

41:39.664 --> 41:42.133
It's like about establishing
a connection.

41:42.166 --> 41:43.802
And then...

41:46.137 --> 41:47.905
- But you do know what I mean though.
- Can you just try

41:47.938 --> 41:49.273
to do the thing though?

41:49.306 --> 41:51.174
I mean, I want you
to have your turn.

41:51.208 --> 41:53.610
But it's not,
it's like, not a turn.

41:53.643 --> 41:54.911
- Because nothing's happening.
- Okay.

41:54.945 --> 41:57.781
We did the thing you wanted
to do for your turn, - Mm-hmm.

41:57.815 --> 42:00.085
and this is what
I want to do for my turn.

42:02.152 --> 42:03.988
But it's not sex.

42:05.722 --> 42:07.125
I mean, you do understand

42:07.157 --> 42:10.295
- that intimacy is a part of sex, right?
- Yeah.

42:10.728 --> 42:12.096
Okay. Alright.
Sorry.

42:12.128 --> 42:14.798
- Your turn.
- We've talked about this before I feel like.

42:14.831 --> 42:15.599
I'm sorry.

42:15.632 --> 42:18.068
You're right, I'm sorry.
Your turn.

42:18.101 --> 42:19.804
Compliment me.

42:28.112 --> 42:29.713
Okay.

42:33.784 --> 42:36.320
I love your pretty eyelashes.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.896
I love...

42:44.929 --> 42:47.164
- Sorry. Um....
- Oh my god.

42:48.065 --> 42:49.634
- I just don't get it,
- Okay.

42:49.666 --> 42:51.134
but you, do you understand
what I'm trying to,

42:51.168 --> 42:52.637
why I think it's...

42:52.670 --> 42:54.072
I'm sorry.

42:55.139 --> 42:56.007
Are you okay?

42:56.039 --> 42:59.009
I'm gonna go out
and look for Harvey.

43:00.010 --> 43:01.346
- Right now!?
- Yep.

43:01.378 --> 43:02.980
Come on, I'll do it.

43:03.014 --> 43:04.949
I do I think that's
it's really sweet

43:04.981 --> 43:05.782
and I would love to try it.

43:05.815 --> 43:06.716
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't want to do it.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.753
Okay. Okay, then
we don't have to do it,

43:08.786 --> 43:10.288
but just don't go.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.922
Bret, don't go.

43:11.956 --> 43:13.224
That's...
I don't like that,

43:13.257 --> 43:14.858
- I don't want you going outside right now...
- Please! Stop!

43:14.891 --> 43:16.059
- I don't want to.
- That's crazy!

43:16.092 --> 43:17.260
Please, just let me...

43:17.293 --> 43:18.996
I don't want you
to come with me.

45:00.431 --> 45:01.733
<i>Yeah.</i>

45:02.032 --> 45:03.168
Hello?

45:05.503 --> 45:07.439
<i>Bret, your father's
taking a nap, okay?</i>

45:08.338 --> 45:09.974
At 9pm?

45:12.342 --> 45:14.911
<i>Okay.
Well what do you need, honey?</i>

45:14.945 --> 45:17.949
Uh... Nothing.
I'm just calling.

45:22.820 --> 45:24.489
<i>You're not in town,
are you?</i>

45:24.521 --> 45:27.125
- No, I'm...
- <i>Okay.</i>

45:28.192 --> 45:29.327
Um...

45:31.461 --> 45:33.063
Harvey's gone.

45:34.130 --> 45:35.032
He's gone.

45:38.001 --> 45:39.304
<i>Okay.</i>

45:40.070 --> 45:42.539
Harvey, Mom.
My dog.

45:42.572 --> 45:44.408
<i>I know who Harvey is.</i>

45:48.378 --> 45:50.447
- <i>Oh my god, Bret.</i>
- Yeah.

45:56.019 --> 45:57.822
<i>You know your father
loved that dog.</i>

45:57.855 --> 45:59.257
Yeah, can you just
put him on then?

45:59.289 --> 46:01.826
<i>He's working, Bret,
I told you.</i>

46:04.360 --> 46:06.163
Napping.

46:06.563 --> 46:08.065
Remember.

46:08.097 --> 46:09.400
You said, "napping".

46:09.432 --> 46:13.505
It's important to keep track.

46:15.072 --> 46:17.208
<i>I'm just trying
to keep things nice.</i>

46:17.240 --> 46:18.909
<i>Okay?</i>

46:44.001 --> 46:45.170
Hey!

46:46.503 --> 46:49.007
Hey! Hey!

46:56.981 --> 46:58.283
Hey!

47:12.362 --> 47:13.831
Fuck.

50:36.266 --> 50:37.334
<i>Traffic.</i>

50:37.367 --> 50:39.202
Hi, I'm calling to report
a suspicious vehicle.

50:39.670 --> 50:41.105
<i>Alright.</i>

50:42.405 --> 50:44.708
Are you the person
to do that?

50:44.740 --> 50:46.309
<i>Yep.
Go ahead.</i>

50:48.177 --> 50:49.480
It's parked in an alley

50:49.512 --> 50:50.780
and creeping behind
people's houses.

50:50.813 --> 50:53.483
<i>So, the vehicle's
parked or moving?</i>

50:55.385 --> 50:57.555
Well, it's parked
right now but it's,

50:57.588 --> 51:00.557
it's been creeping and I saw
a dude getting in to it,

51:00.590 --> 51:03.360
like a really creepy dude
getting into it with my dog.

51:04.561 --> 51:06.364
<i>Why would he have your dog?</i>

51:07.130 --> 51:08.833
I don't know.
He took my dog.

51:08.865 --> 51:12.103
My dog's been missing
and I saw this guy getting,

51:12.135 --> 51:14.672
I saw him getting into
the creepy car.

51:14.704 --> 51:17.074
<i>So your dog's missing.</i>

51:17.507 --> 51:18.475
Yes!

51:18.509 --> 51:19.777
<i>Alright well,
you call animal control</i>

51:19.809 --> 51:21.612
<i>and they'll open at 9 o'clock.</i>

51:21.644 --> 51:22.780
<i>Let me give you
that number here...</i>

51:22.813 --> 51:24.548
No-no-no.
I'm not... No. No.

51:24.581 --> 51:25.816
- Not animal control.
- <i>Hold, one sec...</i>

51:25.849 --> 51:28.318
This guy stole my car.

51:28.351 --> 51:29.619
I mean... Fuck.

51:29.652 --> 51:31.822
- <i>Ahh...</i>
- This guy stole my dog.

51:32.255 --> 51:35.291
<i>Alright, when did,
when did this happen.</i>

51:35.324 --> 51:36.693
Like an hour ago.

51:37.628 --> 51:39.230
<i>Well you have to wait 24 hours</i>

51:39.262 --> 51:40.898
<i>before you can report
a dog to animal control.</i>

51:40.931 --> 51:42.766
No!
Not animal control!

51:42.798 --> 51:46.804
This guy stole my dog
one hour ago,

51:46.836 --> 51:48.438
the car is parked!

51:48.472 --> 51:49.707
I can see the car!

51:49.739 --> 51:52.275
It's parked in the middle of an
alley the very least you can do

51:52.309 --> 51:53.511
is tow the car!

51:53.543 --> 51:54.777
<i>Yeah. Ugh.</i>

51:54.811 --> 51:56.914
<i>Yeah, we'll send somebody out.</i>

51:56.947 --> 51:58.548
Well when are you
gonna do that?

51:58.581 --> 51:59.817
<i>Somebody will be out.</i>

51:59.849 --> 52:02.485
- When?!
- <i>Alright, we'll send somebody out then.</i>

52:02.518 --> 52:04.121
Hello?!

53:39.849 --> 53:41.284
Oh god!

53:41.318 --> 53:42.953
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!

53:42.985 --> 53:44.754
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!

53:44.788 --> 53:46.224
Don't touch it!

53:51.027 --> 53:52.495
Oh!

54:42.478 --> 54:43.813
Oh! Fuck.

57:50.199 --> 57:53.603
<i>My girl, my girl</i>

57:53.637 --> 57:56.940
<i>Where will you go?</i>

57:56.972 --> 58:02.913
<i>I'm going where
the cold wind blows.</i>

58:03.947 --> 58:07.184
<i>In the pines, In the pines,</i>

58:07.217 --> 58:09.186
<i>Where the sun don't ever sh...</i>

58:09.219 --> 58:11.088
I can't find the book
anywhere.

58:11.655 --> 58:12.723
And like a month goes by,

58:12.755 --> 58:15.858
so my mom ends up having
to buy it from the library.

58:15.891 --> 58:18.694
But then, I had a dream.

58:18.728 --> 58:20.998
And the book
was in the dream.

58:21.030 --> 58:23.233
So when I woke up I went
and looked where the book was

58:23.266 --> 58:25.068
in the dream,
and I found it!

58:25.101 --> 58:27.304
So, that's what you need to do,

58:27.336 --> 58:30.173
you need to like,
dream where she is.

58:35.612 --> 58:36.813
Then again,

58:36.847 --> 58:39.016
I tried that when my cat got
lost and it didn't really work.

58:39.048 --> 58:41.117
I mean, yeah I found the cat,

58:41.150 --> 58:43.185
but it was weeks later
and it had died.

58:43.219 --> 58:45.923
So, not the desired result.

58:46.889 --> 58:49.058
I had been having a lot
of nightmares around that time

58:49.092 --> 58:51.628
so that might have had
something to do with it.

58:51.994 --> 58:53.963
'Cause it's like they say,

58:53.996 --> 58:56.299
that you can try
to dream dreams,

58:56.333 --> 58:58.936
but really your dreams
dream you?

58:59.768 --> 59:01.637
And then if you overstep
I guess your dreams

59:01.670 --> 59:03.640
just get pissed off
and kill your cat.

59:08.143 --> 59:10.613
Does she like to sleep more
with men or women?

59:21.023 --> 59:24.094
<i>At the tone, please record
your voice message...</i>

59:24.728 --> 59:25.628
Hi, Bret.

59:25.663 --> 59:28.931
I've just been wondering
where you've been.

59:28.965 --> 59:30.733
I would love to see you.

59:30.766 --> 59:34.103
Um, and see how you're doing.

59:34.137 --> 59:37.173
And, just know where you are?

59:39.409 --> 59:44.114
Will you be home for dinner?

59:44.847 --> 59:46.182
<i>Um...</i>

59:46.983 --> 59:49.920
<i>Just call me when you can,
I miss you I love you.</i>

59:52.889 --> 59:55.259
<i>Just call me please
when you get this.</i>

59:55.824 --> 59:57.259
<i>Um. Okay.</i>

59:57.293 --> 59:58.260
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

59:58.293 --> 59:59.963
<i>I'm sorry. I'm...</i>

1:00:02.766 --> 1:00:05.101
<i>Just call me, please.
Thank you. Bye.</i>

1:02:13.896 --> 1:02:16.199
<i>So she clocked out early
is that why she's not here?</i>

1:02:16.231 --> 1:02:17.768
She didn't show up.

1:02:18.802 --> 1:02:19.903
Are you sure?
Can you check?

1:02:19.936 --> 1:02:21.971
Is there some kind of
time-clock system or something?

1:02:22.005 --> 1:02:23.140
Or how does it work,
how can you be sure if someone...

1:02:23.172 --> 1:02:25.308
I've been here all day,
she was a no-call, no-show.

1:02:25.474 --> 1:02:26.643
Not a lot I can do for ya.

1:02:26.675 --> 1:02:28.811
No-call like, you didn't call
her or she didn't call in?

1:02:28.844 --> 1:02:30.813
Like she didn't call in
and she didn't show up,

1:02:30.847 --> 1:02:31.948
- and I had to...
- Did anybody call her?

1:02:31.981 --> 1:02:33.383
Did anybody get
in touch with her?

1:02:33.416 --> 1:02:34.484
No.

1:02:34.516 --> 1:02:36.853
<i>You have to let me know
that you're okay.</i>

1:02:37.487 --> 1:02:39.322
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

1:02:39.355 --> 1:02:41.557
<i>I'm sorry, I don't know
if you're angry or what,</i>

1:02:41.590 --> 1:02:43.893
<i>but to not hear
from you all day</i>

1:02:43.927 --> 1:02:48.432
<i>is making me feel so crazy
and so scared.</i>

1:02:49.097 --> 1:02:50.833
<i>I don't know why you
didn't show up to work?</i>

1:02:50.867 --> 1:02:52.469
<i>Your boss never heard from you.</i>

1:02:52.501 --> 1:02:55.873
<i>That's... you're gonna get,
you're gonna get fired.</i>

1:02:56.873 --> 1:02:59.909
<i>And you took the car?</i>

1:02:59.943 --> 1:03:02.846
<i>Where is the car?
I had to ride my bike to work.</i>

1:03:03.579 --> 1:03:05.915
<i>You can't just take the car
and go missing, Bret,</i>

1:03:05.949 --> 1:03:07.217
<i>that's insane.</i>

1:03:07.250 --> 1:03:08.150
<i>It's not fair.</i>

1:03:08.184 --> 1:03:10.286
<i>I'm... If I don't hear
from you soon</i>

1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:12.956
<i>I am going to call
your parents.</i>

1:03:12.989 --> 1:03:14.057
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1:03:14.090 --> 1:03:16.492
<i>Because you haven't left me
any other options.</i>

1:03:16.525 --> 1:03:19.596
<i>I hope that you understand
I don't want to do that.</i>

1:03:19.628 --> 1:03:22.464
<i>I don't want to do that to you,
and I wouldn't do it to you</i>

1:03:22.498 --> 1:03:23.867
<i>if you would have
just called me</i>

1:03:23.900 --> 1:03:25.235
<i>and let me know where you were.</i>

1:03:25.268 --> 1:03:29.206
<i>I don't want to ever make
you feel like I don't...</i>

1:03:31.206 --> 1:03:33.542
<i>I'm sorry... I really, you have
to let me know where you are.</i>

1:03:33.576 --> 1:03:34.644
<i>This is so scary.</i>

1:03:34.677 --> 1:03:37.514
<i>Please call me or text me.
I love you so much.</i>

1:04:17.552 --> 1:04:20.056
<i>Now here on this
hind quarter,</i>

1:04:20.088 --> 1:04:23.259
<i>I've separated this piece
from the bone.</i>

1:04:24.427 --> 1:04:28.198
And you can tell
that this piece,

1:04:28.563 --> 1:04:31.067
it was just meant
to come off on it's own.

1:04:31.099 --> 1:04:32.501
I mean, look at that.

1:04:32.534 --> 1:04:34.136
Just go for it.

1:04:34.469 --> 1:04:35.972
I mean, that piece...

1:04:37.172 --> 1:04:38.174
I'm no butcher!

1:05:09.539 --> 1:05:10.674
Get away from me.

1:05:11.273 --> 1:05:12.509
Open this door.

1:05:12.541 --> 1:05:13.710
Don't touch me.

1:05:13.742 --> 1:05:15.612
Open this door.

1:05:15.744 --> 1:05:17.580
I don't have anything.

1:05:18.246 --> 1:05:22.184
Let him out or I swear to God
I'll break this thing open.

1:05:22.217 --> 1:05:25.154
Leave me alone,
I'm nobody, I've got nothing.

1:05:25.188 --> 1:05:26.956
I saw you.

1:05:27.489 --> 1:05:29.224
I didn't do anything to you.

1:05:29.257 --> 1:05:30.626
I saw you take him.

1:05:30.659 --> 1:05:31.728
You saw nothing.

1:05:31.760 --> 1:05:34.498
I can hear him right now!

1:08:12.588 --> 1:08:14.191
<i>Alice?</i>

1:08:16.893 --> 1:08:18.295
Al?

1:08:19.828 --> 1:08:21.297
<i>Alice?</i>

1:08:32.807 --> 1:08:34.310
Alice?!

1:08:47.289 --> 1:08:48.457
Alice!?

1:08:49.292 --> 1:08:50.627
- Alice?
- No!

1:08:50.659 --> 1:08:51.961
Are you okay?

1:08:51.994 --> 1:08:54.296
- No-no-no-no-no-no-no, please go back in the house?
- What?

1:08:54.329 --> 1:08:55.698
- No. No.
- What's wrong?

1:08:55.730 --> 1:08:57.766
Bret, please go back
in the house!

1:08:57.800 --> 1:08:59.369
- Are you okay?
- No!

1:08:59.402 --> 1:09:00.802
- What's wrong?
- I'm so sorry!

1:09:00.836 --> 1:09:02.939
- What's wrong?
- I'm so sorry, Bret!

1:09:02.971 --> 1:09:04.407
Please don't look at me.

1:09:04.439 --> 1:09:05.507
- Hey-hey-hey-hey...
- No!

1:09:05.541 --> 1:09:06.775
- Are you okay?
- No, don't look at me!

1:09:06.809 --> 1:09:08.545
- Are you hurt? What's wrong?
- No.

1:09:10.779 --> 1:09:13.817
Don't...
don't look in the hole.

1:09:16.418 --> 1:09:17.354
Alice, just tell me.

1:09:18.954 --> 1:09:20.823
Bret, I'm a really bad person.

1:09:20.855 --> 1:09:21.689
What!

1:09:21.724 --> 1:09:23.359
No you're not,
you're the best person.

1:09:23.391 --> 1:09:24.760
No, I am.
I'm a really bad person.

1:09:24.793 --> 1:09:25.929
- But please don't...
- Why? What?

1:09:25.962 --> 1:09:27.630
Please don't leave me.

1:09:27.662 --> 1:09:29.364
I'm not going to leave you,
I'm right here.

1:09:29.398 --> 1:09:31.868
- Bret, I ate Harvey.
- What? No.

1:09:31.900 --> 1:09:35.904
I ate Harvey, but please
don't, please don't leave.

1:09:35.938 --> 1:09:37.673
Shhh.
Take a deep breath.

1:09:37.707 --> 1:09:40.810
You did not eat Harvey.
Come here. Come here.

1:09:40.842 --> 1:09:42.811
You did not eat Harvey,
what's wrong?

1:09:42.845 --> 1:09:43.713
What's wrong?

1:09:43.746 --> 1:09:45.248
Oh...

1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:46.315
Please.

1:09:46.349 --> 1:09:48.217
Bret...

1:09:49.585 --> 1:09:50.720
Hey, hey look at me.

1:09:52.255 --> 1:09:53.323
What's wrong?

1:09:53.355 --> 1:09:54.823
I... I... Oh.

1:09:54.856 --> 1:09:56.359
I ate our dog.

1:09:56.391 --> 1:09:57.626
No.
You did not eat...

1:09:57.659 --> 1:09:58.827
You did not eat our dog.

1:09:58.860 --> 1:10:01.430
- I'm so, I'm so sorry.
- No.

1:10:01.463 --> 1:10:03.832
Nobody ate Harvey.
Harvey's gone.

1:10:03.865 --> 1:10:05.534
I'm such a bad person.

1:10:05.568 --> 1:10:08.671
- No.
- Please forgive me, please forgive me.

1:10:08.703 --> 1:10:10.472
- Please don't leave.
- Shh-shh-shh-shh.

1:10:13.442 --> 1:10:15.244
- Listen to me.
- Uh-huh.

1:10:15.610 --> 1:10:17.546
You're okay, okay?

1:10:17.579 --> 1:10:19.582
I'm right here.
Just take a deep breath.

1:10:19.614 --> 1:10:21.317
- I'm so tired.
- Shh.

1:10:21.350 --> 1:10:22.418
Take a deep breath.

1:10:22.451 --> 1:10:23.987
You're okay, you're okay.

1:10:24.020 --> 1:10:25.889
I'm right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

1:10:26.454 --> 1:10:28.792
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1:10:29.891 --> 1:10:32.628
- I don't deserve you.
- Yes, you do.

1:10:32.662 --> 1:10:35.632
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so tired.

1:10:35.664 --> 1:10:38.734
I know I know,
but we're going to rest okay?

1:10:39.534 --> 1:10:40.336
Alright.

1:10:41.871 --> 1:10:42.872
You okay?

1:10:44.306 --> 1:10:45.507
You alright?

1:10:45.541 --> 1:10:47.976
- No.
- I'm sorry.

1:10:48.010 --> 1:10:49.979
I ate the dog.

1:10:50.011 --> 1:10:51.380
No.

1:10:52.481 --> 1:10:55.885
And I was scared,
I didn't know where you were.

1:10:55.917 --> 1:10:59.721
Oh, baby. I'm sorry.
It's okay.

1:10:59.755 --> 1:11:02.359
- No, I''m so yucky.
- No.

1:11:07.329 --> 1:11:08.765
Look at me.
Look at me.

1:11:10.865 --> 1:11:13.036
- I love you more than anything.
- I love you.

1:11:14.369 --> 1:11:15.572
I love you.

1:11:16.971 --> 1:11:18.407
I love you.
