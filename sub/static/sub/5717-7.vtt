00:00.844 --> 00:01.343
♪♪

00:02.984 --> 00:04.453
Is the baby mine?

00:04.934 --> 00:05.660
Yes.

00:06.379 --> 00:07.628
Does Rene know?

00:07.879 --> 00:08.449
Yes.

00:09.628 --> 00:12.316
But we decided to
raise it as our own.

00:12.781 --> 00:15.625
So, we cart the water
over here, and then

00:15.641 --> 00:18.929
we water each one of them,
by hand, every day?

00:18.941 --> 00:21.003
One day, we'll get irrigation.

00:21.223 --> 00:22.902
But what about
everything else, Gino?

00:22.918 --> 00:26.214
When.. when do we find time to
do all the rest of the work?

00:26.430 --> 00:26.930
Eh!

00:28.461 --> 00:30.094
Everything will be good.

00:30.738 --> 00:32.031
It'll all work out.

00:32.051 --> 00:34.855
I have to say, I was shocked,
when you printed my last piece.

00:35.273 --> 00:37.835
Specially as I didn't write a
single word you asked me to.

00:37.875 --> 00:39.949
You going back to Ash Park,
or you staying in town?

00:39.957 --> 00:41.972
I'm in the city, I have
an apartment here.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.075
How convenient.

00:43.650 --> 00:45.759
It's Reggie's funeral on Friday

00:45.791 --> 00:48.118
Just gonna be me and
a few of the men.

00:48.157 --> 00:49.164
Would you mind...

00:50.063 --> 00:51.289
I'd like to be there.

00:51.430 --> 00:53.266
Ah, that's gonna be wonderful.

00:54.762 --> 00:58.410
This, whatever this
is, it has to stop.

00:58.715 --> 01:00.145
Did you sleep with my wife?

01:00.151 --> 01:03.442
That's probably the one thing,
I haven't done with her.

01:03.501 --> 01:06.102
- Aarrgh!
- How could you.

01:06.798 --> 01:08.430
After everything we did.

01:08.965 --> 01:10.547
You told me I was enough.

01:10.579 --> 01:11.992
So this is it, then?

01:14.477 --> 01:16.110
Is this our arrangement?

01:17.696 --> 01:18.844
Is James here?

01:18.930 --> 01:21.000
No, what happened?

01:22.840 --> 01:24.492
If he contacts you, let me know.

01:27.962 --> 01:28.699
James.

01:29.239 --> 01:30.902
You said, if I ever needed a friend.

01:31.294 --> 01:34.262
I've spent the past twenty years,
raising someone else's child.

01:34.774 --> 01:35.656
But I...

01:37.057 --> 01:38.949
I could never stand
back and watch

01:41.063 --> 01:43.492
someone else play
father to mine.

01:44.683 --> 01:47.948
And I've done my best, to
respect your marriage.

01:48.612 --> 01:50.585
This baby changes everything.

01:52.710 --> 01:53.452
Rene.

01:54.558 --> 01:56.191
I told you to stay away.

01:56.198 --> 01:57.284
SARAH !

01:59.796 --> 02:00.340
Let go !

02:01.088 --> 02:02.065
Sarah !

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:53.908 --> 02:54.766
George !

02:55.720 --> 02:56.509
GEORGE !

02:57.728 --> 02:58.485
GEORGE !!

03:01.498 --> 03:03.646
Come on you, dreamer.
Up you get.

03:04.306 --> 03:06.204
No time for lazing about, son.

03:06.230 --> 03:07.673
There's work to be done !

03:15.517 --> 03:16.509
Good morning.

03:16.971 --> 03:19.057
Could someone organise
some flowers, next to

03:19.083 --> 03:21.753
my father's photograph
for my mother's arrival.

03:22.056 --> 03:24.090
It's the anniversary
of his death, today.

03:24.700 --> 03:25.575
Of course.

03:25.888 --> 03:29.059
I've given some thought to what you
said, concerning the christening.

03:29.337 --> 03:31.864
Now, I can have a word to
Reverend Green, if you like.

03:31.942 --> 03:33.051
No, please.

03:33.325 --> 03:36.118
You were right,
James will return.

03:44.208 --> 03:45.110
Regina.

03:46.075 --> 03:48.567
I'm just here, to give
Olivia my christening gift.

03:48.771 --> 03:49.895
A silver spoon.

03:50.131 --> 03:52.012
Are you going somewhere?
Sydney.

03:52.138 --> 03:54.469
Is it about James?
Have you heard anything?

03:54.495 --> 03:56.008
I'm having lunch
with Sir Richard.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.543
Be careful with Dickie, George.
He bites.

04:04.122 --> 04:06.024
I'm aware of that,
but thank you.

04:17.903 --> 04:18.988
Rose.

04:19.015 --> 04:20.850
Oh, good morning Mrs. Standish.

04:20.898 --> 04:22.343
Aren't you a busy little thing,

04:22.369 --> 04:24.773
polishing all the silver,
for the christening.

04:24.817 --> 04:28.312
Is Master James returning
today, or tomorrow?

04:28.359 --> 04:29.679
We couldn't be certain, Ma'am.

04:29.718 --> 04:32.316
I have an urgent message
I need delivered to him.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.741
Do you know where he's staying?

04:34.261 --> 04:35.511
You must have some idea?

04:36.230 --> 04:38.166
Surely Mrs. Bligh is
in regular contact

04:38.192 --> 04:39.739
with her husband via telephone.

04:40.567 --> 04:43.511
Well, you see, Mrs. Standish,
there was an argument.

04:44.559 --> 04:46.496
Between Mr. James
and Miss Olivia.

04:46.692 --> 04:48.168
Miss Olivia was very upset.

04:48.457 --> 04:50.976
And Mr. James set off for
Sydney, straight after.

04:51.309 --> 04:54.168
They say, he is at his
father's club, but...

04:54.551 --> 04:55.535
But what?

04:56.383 --> 04:58.961
But he's not been answering
Mr. Bligh's messages.

05:00.110 --> 05:02.769
Perhaps he's staying with a friend?
I wouldn't know.

05:03.660 --> 05:08.582
I seem to recall, James and the
surgeon, Mr. Fox were very friendly.

05:09.317 --> 05:10.824
Mr. Fox lives in Sydney.

05:10.922 --> 05:14.018
Yes he does, such
a handsome man.

05:14.430 --> 05:15.902
Well, don't let me
keep you, child.

05:15.994 --> 05:17.910
Will that silverware
polish itself?

05:22.888 --> 05:23.813
To the left.

05:25.204 --> 05:26.089
To the right.

05:27.767 --> 05:28.352
Good.

05:29.349 --> 05:31.387
And no cramps or
discomfort at all?

05:31.793 --> 05:32.293
No.

05:40.177 --> 05:41.075
How's Rene?

05:41.099 --> 05:42.594
Actually he'd eh...

05:43.556 --> 05:45.571
.. like to know, when
you're coming in to visit.

05:46.642 --> 05:48.204
He's been quite clear.

05:48.282 --> 05:49.778
I've reduced the
sedation over the week.

05:49.794 --> 05:51.106
He's still on a small dose.

05:51.767 --> 05:53.383
Maybe in another day or so.

05:54.142 --> 05:56.247
Or this afternoon,
if you're up to it.

05:57.526 --> 05:58.831
Is something the matter?

05:59.005 --> 06:00.260
Come in, we'll talk about it.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.768
Please, just tell me straight.

06:03.448 --> 06:05.901
Well, someone is glad to
see you up and about.

06:06.081 --> 06:07.963
How you going, Doc?
Good.

06:08.214 --> 06:11.463
I was just saying to Sarah,
Rene is keen to see her.

06:14.647 --> 06:16.678
Well, I got to go into town
this morning for some supplies,

06:16.687 --> 06:18.014
You could come in with
me, if you'd like.

06:21.604 --> 06:23.549
Well, I might see
you later then.

06:31.030 --> 06:33.401
'Course, if you'd rather
not, that's alright too.

06:50.094 --> 06:51.195
Here he is.

06:52.430 --> 06:54.984
The sooner he shakes them up
in Parliament, the better.

07:04.903 --> 07:07.531
I thought I might build a cradle,
for when that baby comes.

07:10.262 --> 07:12.351
It'll all work out alright,
you know that, don't you?

07:12.965 --> 07:15.754
If you're worried at first, Rene
can take the lean-to for a while.

07:15.780 --> 07:17.121
There's no need for that.

07:19.452 --> 07:22.570
Well, if you want me to come in with
you today, you just say the word.

07:26.272 --> 07:29.678
Ah, should we sit?
Just tell me.

07:31.565 --> 07:32.393
Tell me.

07:33.261 --> 07:35.721
You are my wife and
you are afraid of me.

07:36.261 --> 07:37.264
Not of you.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.429
Of why I am...
not...

07:40.475 --> 07:41.928
.. in control.

07:42.324 --> 07:43.481
Of design faults.

07:52.168 --> 07:54.345
I'm going to have the operation.

07:55.332 --> 07:57.278
I've been speaking
to Patrick Kelly

07:57.304 --> 07:58.335
over the last couple of days.

07:58.343 --> 07:59.632
- I see.
- Yes.

07:59.895 --> 08:02.019
There's new research in the city.
Yes.

08:02.035 --> 08:04.492
He's offered to hold a space
on his surgical list.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.570
You both know the
prognosis of surgery?

08:06.576 --> 08:08.123
Kelly and I see it the same way.

08:08.428 --> 08:10.333
And how do you see it, Rene?

08:11.975 --> 08:13.263
The shrapnel...

08:13.787 --> 08:16.100
.. it is removed
in surgery and...

08:17.237 --> 08:19.158
.. more damage, neurological.

08:20.205 --> 08:22.197
Or I die on the table.

08:23.256 --> 08:25.560
Or I make a complete recovery.

08:26.616 --> 08:28.180
This is the one I want.

08:30.545 --> 08:32.611
I'm a fighter, we both are.

08:39.982 --> 08:41.803
But the risks are too great.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.049
I can't allow you, to
have the operation.

08:49.233 --> 08:51.818
It is MY decision Sarah.
No it's not.

08:52.030 --> 08:53.323
Eh, Sarah..
Jack !

08:53.334 --> 08:56.373
Legally, Rene would not be
deemed to be of sound mind.

08:56.399 --> 08:57.969
He'd be unable to sign
the consent forms,

08:57.979 --> 08:59.391
You know that as well as I do.

08:59.528 --> 09:00.276
Is it true?

09:00.426 --> 09:03.328
As your wife, Rene, only
I can sign the consent.

09:03.747 --> 09:04.742
And I won't do it.

09:04.809 --> 09:06.051
You are afraid of me!

09:06.200 --> 09:07.618
I am afraid of me.

09:07.644 --> 09:09.472
When the baby comes, how
can I be a father !?

09:09.481 --> 09:10.617
I must never be alone with him.

09:13.380 --> 09:14.789
Sarah,

09:16.372 --> 09:17.460
I could sign it.

09:21.727 --> 09:22.884
As Rene's doctor.

09:23.672 --> 09:26.326
This is my decision
to make, not yours.

09:27.501 --> 09:28.492
I won't sign it.

09:28.509 --> 09:30.345
- Sarah.
- It's too risky.

09:30.841 --> 09:32.182
I cannot take this.

09:32.208 --> 09:34.793
In two years time, even
in one years time,

09:34.813 --> 09:37.004
who knows, how much the
surgery will improve!

09:37.013 --> 09:38.973
Let's just wait and see !

09:38.997 --> 09:39.497
Sarah...

09:39.533 --> 09:42.043
I will NOT sign his
death warrant!

09:42.548 --> 09:44.113
And neither will you !!

09:54.536 --> 09:57.393
Something was wrong
between her and Paolo.

09:57.395 --> 09:59.059
She couldn't put
her finger on it.

09:59.231 --> 10:00.324
Charmaine had had a...

10:00.340 --> 10:03.223
..when she arrived back,
after the long train journey,

10:03.254 --> 10:04.965
he'd forgotten to meet
her at the station...

10:04.991 --> 10:06.699
..farmhouse felt cold and sad.

10:06.965 --> 10:08.433
Paolo seemed even more distant...

10:08.449 --> 10:10.300
.. she felt as though
she was being punished

10:10.326 --> 10:12.274
for something but what
had she done wrong?

10:12.300 --> 10:14.027
Anna, come on !!

10:16.852 --> 10:17.902
Coming !

10:26.036 --> 10:26.973
You know...

10:27.200 --> 10:30.873
.. if there was an easy way to
get these baby vines watered !

10:33.110 --> 10:34.649
And Bella, don't forget,
after you finished that,

10:34.675 --> 10:36.563
the patch at the back
needs to be tilled yeah?

10:36.873 --> 10:39.594
And fertiliser on the
beans, on my list.

10:39.607 --> 10:41.193
Eh, so is boxing the tomatoes.

10:41.814 --> 10:44.556
Boxing tomatoes,
boxing tomatoes.

10:44.572 --> 10:47.501
Boxing potatoes,
boxing potatoes.

10:50.580 --> 10:52.349
That's my joke of the day.

10:55.717 --> 10:58.146
- Ah, I gotta go to work at Carlo's.
- Again?!

10:58.787 --> 10:59.779
Yeah, I promised.

10:59.779 --> 11:02.560
You're too kind Gino,
this is every day now.

11:03.029 --> 11:04.830
You ride the horse every day.

11:05.525 --> 11:08.345
A thorough-breed has to be
ridden every day, you know that.

11:08.689 --> 11:11.306
Isn't that, what they're
paid for at Ash Park, the eh...

11:11.332 --> 11:12.509
.. stable-hands?

11:15.111 --> 11:17.084
I could drive you to Carlo's.

11:17.314 --> 11:19.083
No, I'm gonna walk, just..

11:19.822 --> 11:21.138
.. clear my head.

11:28.568 --> 11:29.248
- SYDNEY -

11:33.837 --> 11:34.751
You what?!

11:34.777 --> 11:36.549
I have given this a
great deal of thought.

11:36.618 --> 11:38.489
Don't think I've made
this decision lightly.

11:38.505 --> 11:40.629
I don't give a damn, how
you made the decision.

11:40.646 --> 11:41.270
It's wrong.

11:41.278 --> 11:42.489
You got pre-selection signed.

11:42.521 --> 11:44.028
Now, why would you
pull the bear?

11:44.060 --> 11:45.897
My priorities have changed.

11:46.779 --> 11:47.642
George...

11:48.103 --> 11:50.251
George, I like you.

11:51.298 --> 11:53.220
You and I know that
all this talk about

11:53.235 --> 11:55.767
Australia, being a
classless society, is a

11:55.798 --> 11:57.825
load of lefty propaganda.

11:58.327 --> 12:01.326
Men like you, could be
the conduit between

12:01.343 --> 12:03.092
the classes. Hell, you
play your cards right,

12:03.093 --> 12:04.506
you could be
Prime-Minister one day.

12:04.554 --> 12:06.051
- Not anymore.
- Why?

12:06.990 --> 12:08.404
My reasons are personal.

12:08.521 --> 12:10.970
There's no personal,
in public life.

12:12.561 --> 12:16.089
Does this have anything to
do with a married Jewess?

12:16.115 --> 12:17.700
You won't have a
political future, if

12:17.726 --> 12:19.351
you tie yourself to
baggies like that.

12:19.366 --> 12:21.835
As I've said, I no longer
want a political future.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.761
It is about the Jew.

12:24.017 --> 12:25.514
My reasons are my own.

12:25.525 --> 12:27.294
I ask you to respect that.

12:27.306 --> 12:29.822
I've already started talking
to people, about you.

12:30.111 --> 12:32.986
Your withdrawal will be a
personal embarrassment.

12:33.107 --> 12:35.255
Then I apoligise for
that, sincerely.

12:35.998 --> 12:37.771
Bligh can head the bloody bill !

12:43.450 --> 12:46.192
Get your wooly head out
of that blasted book !

12:46.981 --> 12:49.158
I didn't bring you here to read.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.731
Yes, father.

12:51.685 --> 12:54.576
Look, you see that
fellow over there?

12:54.755 --> 12:56.141
That's Sid Gregory.

12:56.149 --> 12:58.462
Played sixty tests,
for Australia.

12:59.290 --> 13:02.950
And Rogers over there, won the
Victoria Cross, in the Boer War.

13:04.946 --> 13:06.782
If you want to make your mark,

13:06.790 --> 13:09.008
you need to pull up
your boot straps.

13:09.282 --> 13:10.645
Face the world.

13:11.480 --> 13:12.926
Be a man.

13:23.087 --> 13:24.223
Mr. Goddard.

13:24.856 --> 13:27.497
Mrs. Bligh.
- Ah, Mr. Goddard.

13:27.705 --> 13:29.314
I heard so much about you.

13:29.494 --> 13:31.059
All favourable, I hope?

13:31.166 --> 13:32.982
Mr. Goddard, my
daughter Carolyn.

13:33.701 --> 13:35.501
Thank you Carolyn, I
meet you at the car.

13:36.103 --> 13:37.603
Well, I hope to see you again.

13:39.408 --> 13:40.496
You're leaving ?

13:40.892 --> 13:42.017
Returning to Ash Park.

13:42.033 --> 13:43.626
My great-grandson's christening.

13:43.728 --> 13:45.564
Oh, a happy occasion.

13:46.279 --> 13:47.634
When will you be back ?

13:48.049 --> 13:49.275
I'm undecided.

13:51.261 --> 13:54.425
Just wanted to thank you
for coming  .???...

13:55.578 --> 13:58.095
These are unnecessary,
but thank you.

13:58.554 --> 14:00.731
Well, it meant a lot to the men.

14:01.421 --> 14:03.101
Become quite special to them.

14:04.675 --> 14:06.011
And to me.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.546
They're just flowers.
I must be going.

14:12.937 --> 14:13.821
Mrs. Bligh...

14:14.351 --> 14:15.984
.. when you come back...

14:17.062 --> 14:19.511
.. let's continue
this conversation?

14:35.930 --> 14:36.648
Come in.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.477
Mrs. Standish.
Mr. Fox.

14:42.191 --> 14:44.863
I hope, I'm not disturbing the
great surgeon at his work?

14:44.902 --> 14:47.503
Ah, just writing some reports
for the Medical Board.

14:47.566 --> 14:49.511
I welcome the disturbance,
please come in.

14:50.892 --> 14:52.141
It's nice to see you again.

14:52.439 --> 14:55.840
I'm staying with friends
in town, and it struck me.

14:55.928 --> 14:59.040
I never thanked you properly,
for saving dear George's life.

15:00.561 --> 15:02.670
I know, a man loves his cigars.

15:03.143 --> 15:04.197
Monte Cristo?

15:04.436 --> 15:06.748
Well, I was simply doing,
what I'm paid to do.

15:06.803 --> 15:08.404
Gifts like this are
really not necessary.

15:08.420 --> 15:11.408
Not necessary, but so
nice to be appreciated.

15:11.694 --> 15:12.650
Thank you.

15:13.225 --> 15:15.428
I'll be sure to enjoy them
with a glass of Courvoisier.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.760
Before I leave you
to your accounting,

15:18.768 --> 15:20.741
I have a small favour to ask.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.392
I was hoping, you might
pass this on to James.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.950
- James..?
- Bligh.

15:30.392 --> 15:32.486
Why would I be
seeing James Bligh?

15:32.643 --> 15:35.185
James is in Sydney,
he might also wish to...

15:35.529 --> 15:37.022
.. express his gratitude.

15:37.221 --> 15:39.580
And if he does, I ask
that you give him this.

15:40.815 --> 15:41.903
Good-day Mr. Fox.

15:43.502 --> 15:44.650
Mrs. Standish.

16:10.147 --> 16:11.615
I've been trying to find you.

16:12.506 --> 16:14.021
I was hoping we might talk.

16:15.295 --> 16:17.193
After all you've been
through in your life,

16:18.151 --> 16:20.072
you deserve for things
to be easier now.

16:20.709 --> 16:22.471
Now that you're going
to be a mother.

16:23.463 --> 16:25.164
You deserve to feel safe.

16:25.959 --> 16:28.646
So you can give your baby
all the love you have.

16:30.174 --> 16:32.072
And you will be a
wonderful mum.

16:32.627 --> 16:33.444
I know that.

16:35.432 --> 16:38.041
One, who'll probably going
back to work, knowing you.

16:38.229 --> 16:40.580
Never mind, what anyone thinks.
We'll see.

16:43.112 --> 16:44.279
But your child...

16:45.112 --> 16:46.132
.. our child...

16:47.010 --> 16:49.430
.. deserves a secure,

16:49.666 --> 16:52.971
loving, stable family life.

16:54.594 --> 16:56.078
And we can do that, Sarah.

16:56.579 --> 16:58.755
We can raise our child together.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.680
We can learn to love
each other again.

17:00.711 --> 17:01.326
Please, George.

17:01.352 --> 17:03.197
I'm not saying, that we
don't look after Rene.

17:03.789 --> 17:05.792
He'll have the very
best of medical care.

17:05.864 --> 17:07.214
He'll still be part of your life.

17:07.231 --> 17:08.230
I could never do that.

17:08.253 --> 17:10.105
This is our chance
for happiness.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.664
You can do that.
I'm married to Rene.

17:14.195 --> 17:16.061
I've just withdrawn
from pre-selection.

17:16.582 --> 17:18.105
Our private lives
will be our own.

17:18.131 --> 17:19.285
You should never
have done that.

17:19.303 --> 17:20.685
This is what is important now !

17:20.692 --> 17:22.411
It has to be !
Our child.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.682
We have to give our child
the future it deserves.

17:24.708 --> 17:27.137
A future that we plan together.
George, stop !

17:27.172 --> 17:30.090
How can you love Rene.
He's not the man he was !

17:33.161 --> 17:35.387
You've no right to
speak to me like this.

17:36.001 --> 17:37.594
About who Rene was.

17:38.813 --> 17:40.718
We have nothing left to say.

17:54.676 --> 17:55.950
Welcome back, Mrs. Bligh.

17:55.976 --> 17:57.996
- Thank you, ehm...
- Rose.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.179
Right, Rose.

18:00.070 --> 18:01.702
Would you mind, putting
these in a vase.

18:01.749 --> 18:04.210
And on the piano, with
something under the vase.

18:04.304 --> 18:05.120
I'll be off.

18:05.648 --> 18:07.022
I'm going to visit the hospital.

18:07.023 --> 18:08.280
Say hello to Jack, for me.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.944
Try not to cause
too much trouble.

18:12.628 --> 18:13.679
Elizabeth.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.675
- It's been so long.
- Olivia.

18:19.464 --> 18:20.683
And how is our little fellow?

18:20.730 --> 18:22.499
I've so missed his smiles.

18:22.539 --> 18:24.055
- Georgie is sleeping.
- Ah.

18:24.308 --> 18:26.643
He's not still keeping you
awake at night, is he?

18:26.667 --> 18:28.737
No, no, he's much improved.

18:29.406 --> 18:32.710
Now, I saw the other maids cleaning
out the groundsman's quarters.

18:32.835 --> 18:34.538
I'm assuming, the
artist fellow has left.

18:34.546 --> 18:36.159
I'd very much like
to see the portrait.

18:36.226 --> 18:40.307
Ah, we had to ask him to leave.

18:40.737 --> 18:44.207
The portrait was thoroughly
unsuitable, I'm afraid.

18:44.331 --> 18:44.831
Oh.

18:46.191 --> 18:49.034
Oh well, I can’t
say I’m surprised.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.971
He is a friend of
Carolyn’s and her

18:50.997 --> 18:53.043
taste does tend toward
the avant-garde.

18:53.723 --> 18:55.809
- Oh, yes.
- Where's James?

18:56.286 --> 18:57.306
He's in Sydney.

18:57.493 --> 18:58.516
And when is he due back?

18:58.782 --> 19:00.006
Today or tomorrow.

19:00.696 --> 19:03.000
- Well, let's hope it's today.
- Yeah.

19:12.305 --> 19:13.453
You might as well stay.

19:13.579 --> 19:14.930
Might as well?

19:16.246 --> 19:19.160
Now, you gotta come back for
the christening, anyway.

19:19.563 --> 19:22.172
Such a romantic proposition,
how can I say no?

19:22.274 --> 19:25.043
You know I'd love to, Jack, but I
have a meeting with Sir Richard.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.469
- What's that look?
- No look.

19:29.583 --> 19:33.762
I'm trying to convince him, to profile
some of the new ..... artists.

19:33.782 --> 19:36.328
Well, if anyone can convince
him of that, you can.

19:36.661 --> 19:38.433
Am I devious, common and wild?

19:39.019 --> 19:40.448
Well, not so devious.

19:40.953 --> 19:43.773
Oh, are you saying I'm tactless
and gauche, Dr. Duncan?

19:44.211 --> 19:47.144
You are a thoroughly modern
woman Carolyn, but...

19:47.808 --> 19:49.819
Sir Richard is an
old-fashioned bloke.

19:49.867 --> 19:52.860
Sir Richard is a pussycat.
I can handle him.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.987
But I promise, I
will be careful,

19:56.996 --> 19:58.683
if you promise, not
to be jealous.

19:58.714 --> 19:59.938
- Jealous?
- Hmm.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.932
Of his money, power
and influence?

20:03.050 --> 20:06.413
Besides, I got something
he doesn't have.

20:24.109 --> 20:27.397
Excuse me, Mr. Bligh.
Mr. Briggs is here and asking to see you.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.104
Don't mean to be a
bother, Mr. Bligh.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.350
If it's not a good time.
Course not, Roy.

20:32.366 --> 20:33.147
Come in.

20:39.085 --> 20:41.663
I take it, by the look on your
face, you don't want one?

20:41.780 --> 20:44.124
Don't go, putting words
in my mouth, Mr. Bligh.

20:45.163 --> 20:47.307
I see you're back from
the big smoke, so...

20:47.605 --> 20:50.206
.. I thought now is be as good
a time as any, to catch you up.

20:50.534 --> 20:51.385
Cheers.

20:52.077 --> 20:54.796
I done just as you asked and spoken
to most of the farmers here abouts

20:54.804 --> 20:56.327
and I can guarantee
you their support.

20:56.437 --> 20:58.233
Specially when it comes
to that rotten coal mine.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.690
Roy, I appreciate everything
you've done for me, I do.

21:01.976 --> 21:04.053
But I've decided, not
to run after all.

21:04.683 --> 21:05.382
Come again?

21:05.780 --> 21:07.460
I've withdrawn my candidacy.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.538
But, you're a dead-cert Mr. Bligh.

21:09.968 --> 21:11.796
There are no guarantees in life.

21:11.968 --> 21:13.612
People round here are
counting on you.

21:13.638 --> 21:15.122
Well, they just have to
count on somebody else.

21:15.130 --> 21:17.661
When you spoke, you've got
everyone all excited for change.

21:17.687 --> 21:19.932
I'm sure, the party will find a far
better representative, than me.

21:19.968 --> 21:22.373
Who, there's none better.
Perhaps you could run.

21:31.131 --> 21:33.240
I thought the Blighs
were men of their word.

21:36.947 --> 21:39.205
Don't make me ashamed
of you, George.

21:40.178 --> 21:42.302
I've paid the lady
for her services.

21:42.412 --> 21:44.045
Don't insult her, or me.

21:44.475 --> 21:46.201
I don't want to, father.

21:47.298 --> 21:49.392
First time at anything,
is the hardest.

21:50.432 --> 21:53.291
I can't.
You can and you will.

21:54.018 --> 21:55.718
Goddammit, you're a Bligh.

21:56.096 --> 21:57.752
Now do you duty.

22:01.568 --> 22:03.435
George.
George !!

22:04.291 --> 22:05.009
George.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.263
- Mother.
- Hello George.

22:11.525 --> 22:12.750
How are you today?

22:13.002 --> 22:14.236
Well, thank you.

22:16.073 --> 22:18.638
Today will always be
a day of reflection.

22:19.147 --> 22:20.240
Yes, indeed.

22:21.108 --> 22:23.693
Can I organise someone, to
take you to father's grave?

22:24.865 --> 22:27.185
No, I can make my own
way, George, thank you.

22:28.358 --> 22:30.107
Why is James not here?

22:30.428 --> 22:32.469
He and Olivia had an argument.

22:33.123 --> 22:35.666
Now, I didn't pry and I
trust you won't either.

22:40.627 --> 22:43.158
I should tell you, I've
withdrawn from pre-selection.

22:44.025 --> 22:45.965
Please mother, spare
me the lecture,

22:46.222 --> 22:47.322
to queen and country.

22:47.361 --> 22:49.657
George, what possible reason..?

22:52.264 --> 22:54.033
Has this to do with Sarah?

22:54.311 --> 22:55.311
Why on earth would it?

22:56.257 --> 22:58.436
Mrs. Nordmann's concerned
with her sick husband.

22:58.607 --> 23:00.319
Probably will be, for
the rest of her life.

23:23.419 --> 23:24.984
Not what it looks like.

23:25.618 --> 23:26.903
Is this the new farmhand?

23:27.134 --> 23:29.071
I'm going to keep
Stardust here, so that I

23:29.097 --> 23:31.033
don't have to keep going
back to Ash Park.

23:31.536 --> 23:33.919
You were right, it'll
save me an hour a day.

23:34.224 --> 23:36.001
Anna, you're not
thinking like a farmer.

23:36.314 --> 23:38.521
Well, forgive me, but
that's probably because

23:38.547 --> 23:40.416
I haven't been doing
it for very long.

23:40.953 --> 23:41.694
Where you going?

23:41.953 --> 23:42.976
Put her in the shed.

23:43.007 --> 23:44.210
 The shed's full of hay.

23:44.226 --> 23:45.632
Well, then we'll
have to move it.

23:45.644 --> 23:47.515
She stays in the
paddock, with a blanket.

23:47.648 --> 23:49.638
Gino, I'm trying to
solve our problems

23:49.664 --> 23:51.023
by finding more
hours in the day.

23:51.034 --> 23:52.678
And you brought
the problem here.

23:52.972 --> 23:54.252
Why are you being like this?

23:54.276 --> 23:56.112
It's a horse for a mansion,
not a farmer's horse.

23:56.120 --> 23:57.385
Well, you didn't marry a farmer.

23:57.401 --> 23:59.986
You married me, and
I'm doing my best.

24:00.948 --> 24:02.471
Don't you remember
what you said to me?

24:02.476 --> 24:04.424
You said that you don't want
me to be like your mamma.

24:04.589 --> 24:08.147
Not, tied to the kitchen
sink in an apron,

24:08.155 --> 24:09.473
working my fingers to the bone,

24:09.499 --> 24:11.701
but somehow I think, that
is exactly what you want.

24:11.727 --> 24:13.147
No, I don't.

24:16.379 --> 24:18.894
When the hay is sold, I
put her in the shed.

24:19.277 --> 24:21.114
It's getting cold at night.

24:36.678 --> 24:38.791
My dear James.
Reggie.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.018
You received my message.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.246
Please, sit.

24:52.612 --> 24:53.752
I want you to know,

24:53.924 --> 24:56.291
that no matter what choices
you've made in your life,

24:56.651 --> 24:58.705
I will never stop
supporting you.

25:00.049 --> 25:02.611
Having never been blessed
with children of my own,

25:02.925 --> 25:05.721
my dear sister wanted me,
to think of you as a son.

25:07.587 --> 25:08.629
And I do.

25:11.649 --> 25:13.821
Well, that's exactly
what I said to him.

25:14.126 --> 25:16.961
No, I want you to talk to
him, make him see some sense.

25:18.173 --> 25:20.825
- What are you doing here?
- We have a meeting scheduled.

25:22.040 --> 25:25.219
Sorry, but I'm too busy to
talk about art, right now.

25:25.235 --> 25:27.758
Trying to sort out this
brouhaha, your brother's made.

25:27.888 --> 25:29.294
George?
What's he done?

25:29.298 --> 25:30.571
Ah, nothing for you
to worry about.

25:30.585 --> 25:31.524
I'm dealing with it.

25:31.657 --> 25:33.583
Well, when you've
"dealt" with it,

25:33.583 --> 25:35.489
perhaps you'll take the
time, to read my proposal.

25:35.575 --> 25:38.114
I haven't got the time,
to read anything !

25:38.583 --> 25:40.352
Not even my own newspaper.

25:40.513 --> 25:41.684
So, when will you?

25:41.745 --> 25:43.637
I'd like to discuss
my ideas with you.

25:44.351 --> 25:48.506
We have to find time outside office
hours, to talk about your ideas then.

25:48.554 --> 25:50.741
Perhaps tonight, I could
drop by your place

25:50.937 --> 25:52.433
I make a mean Martini.

25:53.163 --> 25:54.660
- Perhaps.
- Bennett.

25:55.823 --> 25:57.612
Of course I know. Who
do you think told him?

25:57.995 --> 26:00.737
He broke the news to
me, that day at the club.

26:02.757 --> 26:04.428
He didn't give me
a reason, did he?

26:05.628 --> 26:07.862
Well, not one..
with a pinch of salt.

26:11.718 --> 26:13.010
We had an argument.

26:13.390 --> 26:15.091
We both said some things.

26:16.593 --> 26:17.614
I HAD to leave.

26:17.882 --> 26:21.352
Is there anything I can do?
No, thank you, Reggie.

26:22.093 --> 26:22.850
But...

26:23.816 --> 26:25.108
.. Olivia and I ...

26:27.785 --> 26:29.378
Our relationship is complicated.

26:29.699 --> 26:31.725
I know, what it's
like to be judged,

26:31.843 --> 26:33.858
for not conforming
to convention.

26:34.921 --> 26:36.758
You deserve true happiness.

26:37.210 --> 26:39.550
That's why I can't return
to Ash Park, Reggie.

26:41.417 --> 26:42.089
You must.

26:43.331 --> 26:44.112
You must.

26:45.785 --> 26:47.417
For your wife and child.

26:48.308 --> 26:50.866
You can live any
life you choose,

26:51.476 --> 26:54.202
but that doesn't mean, you can
forsake your responsibilities.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.464
You sound just like
a friend of mine.

26:57.953 --> 26:59.585
It takes courage, James.

27:00.820 --> 27:04.155
And even a courageous man
needs a shoulder, to lean on.

27:06.371 --> 27:08.003
Let me be that shoulder?

28:48.855 --> 28:49.624
Get out !

28:50.538 --> 28:51.921
I said get out !

28:52.953 --> 28:54.765
That is disgusting.

28:56.191 --> 28:57.483
You're disgusting !

28:59.386 --> 29:00.522
Hit me back !

29:01.023 --> 29:02.043
I said hit me !

29:02.671 --> 29:03.901
BE A MAN !

29:06.601 --> 29:08.438
Hit me, George.
COME ON !!

29:50.857 --> 29:51.790
Elizabeth.

29:51.993 --> 29:54.094
I heard, your husband
is in hospital again.

29:54.353 --> 29:57.450
I'm so sorry, I thought, I'd come
and see how you're bearing up.

30:00.895 --> 30:03.324
I'm sure, Rene believes
he'll practice again.

30:04.340 --> 30:06.245
Go back to being a surgeon?

30:06.629 --> 30:08.942
I imagine, he was
a very good one.

30:09.340 --> 30:10.464
A brilliant.

30:13.840 --> 30:16.144
No matter how dreadful the
conditions of surgery,

30:16.170 --> 30:18.214
he just improvised
his way through it.

30:19.084 --> 30:20.724
People were in awe of him.

30:21.459 --> 30:23.500
- A remarkable man.
- He was.

30:24.897 --> 30:26.801
And surely, he can be again.

30:28.127 --> 30:31.166
Not without this operation
Elizabeth, which could kill him.

30:33.424 --> 30:34.517
Or cure him.

30:36.279 --> 30:39.302
Is it selfish of me, to
deny him this opportunity?

30:39.752 --> 30:40.978
No, my dear.

30:42.807 --> 30:44.543
All I know is, that you
will have given this

30:44.569 --> 30:46.412
a great deal of serious thought.

30:49.409 --> 30:51.416
You've been so strong,
through all of this.

30:51.432 --> 30:52.393
I'm tired.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.218
Tired of being strong.

30:57.139 --> 30:58.566
By my experience,

30:59.288 --> 31:01.350
sometimes, the strongest
thing one can do,

31:01.356 --> 31:03.654
is to know, when to
relinquish control.

31:04.631 --> 31:06.307
Easier said than done.

31:06.920 --> 31:10.021
Especially, when it involves
the destiny, of those we love.

32:17.810 --> 32:18.693
A scarf.

32:21.967 --> 32:24.451
Now, she probably has
children of her own.

32:29.069 --> 32:30.709
You are a fighter, my love.

32:33.389 --> 32:34.893
Everything is chance.

32:37.899 --> 32:40.273
What were the chances, we
would survive the war?

32:40.761 --> 32:42.258
Find each other again?

32:43.993 --> 32:45.582
You've made your decision.

32:46.419 --> 32:47.847
And I will honour it.

34:05.608 --> 34:06.629
I'm sorry, lad.

34:07.530 --> 34:08.288
Roy.

34:11.889 --> 34:13.678
He must have been
thrown from his horse.

34:17.679 --> 34:19.288
Father?
Father?!

34:20.085 --> 34:20.983
I'm sorry.

34:21.272 --> 34:22.424
Please, father.

34:22.697 --> 34:24.456
FATHER !!

34:55.793 --> 34:58.605
Now that, is the
perfect Martini.

34:59.399 --> 35:01.812
Almost makes up for your
earlier rudeness, hmm.

35:04.277 --> 35:05.093
Another one?

35:06.820 --> 35:08.886
For a Knight-Commander
you’re incorrigible.

35:08.912 --> 35:10.354
I've been called a lot worse.

35:10.371 --> 35:12.433
Mostly from my adoring wife.

35:12.824 --> 35:14.331
Well, we mustn't drink too much.

35:14.347 --> 35:16.800
This is a business meeting.
Here's to business.

35:18.894 --> 35:21.765
I want to write about what
is happening in Sydney, now.

35:21.808 --> 35:23.300
Not ten years ago.

35:23.335 --> 35:24.752
It's been a real
invigoration with the arts,

35:24.778 --> 35:26.266
with all the new
migrants coming in.

35:26.505 --> 35:28.160
Well, wogs and balts?

35:28.372 --> 35:31.637
Also known as "European
Immigrants",  Sir Richard.

35:31.676 --> 35:34.399
Oh, enough of the "Sir Richard".
Call me Dickie.

35:36.887 --> 35:38.242
Excuse me.

35:42.446 --> 35:44.367
Jack, what are you doing here?

35:44.383 --> 35:46.570
Why, I came to town,
to brief a surgeon.

35:46.743 --> 35:47.973
Thought I spend the night.

35:50.337 --> 35:52.945
Not a good time ?
NO, come on in.

35:59.195 --> 36:00.351
What's he doing here?

36:01.414 --> 36:03.992
It's a business meeting.
Ah.

36:04.836 --> 36:07.254
So, this is the business meeting,
you were telling me about?

36:07.270 --> 36:08.358
NO, not exactly.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.004
Just give me half an
hour, to get rid of him.

36:10.012 --> 36:11.824
No, no, no, you take
all the time you need.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.059
- Jack.
- You...

36:13.184 --> 36:14.668
You promised to be careful.

36:14.778 --> 36:16.910
And you promised,
not to be jealous.

36:16.934 --> 36:19.211
Ah, so there's something going on,
I should be jealous of, is it?

36:19.215 --> 36:20.235
- NO.
- Great!

36:20.262 --> 36:20.972
Jack !

36:22.559 --> 36:23.476
Jack !

36:34.254 --> 36:35.152
Why not.

36:54.847 --> 36:58.519
Father, was not the men,
that he pretended to be.

37:01.714 --> 37:03.687
All that talk of manliness...

37:04.553 --> 37:06.186
.. was a bloody charade.

37:06.855 --> 37:07.683
A lie.

37:08.339 --> 37:09.956
George, what are
you talking about?

37:10.121 --> 37:11.277
The day he died,

37:13.066 --> 37:14.767
I saw him in the stables.

37:18.339 --> 37:19.472
He wasn't alone.

37:21.402 --> 37:22.815
He was with another man.

37:29.302 --> 37:31.343
I hoped, you'd never find out.

37:32.888 --> 37:33.747
You knew?

37:38.103 --> 37:39.259
Ah, I'm so sorry.

37:41.239 --> 37:44.098
You of all people have
nothing to apologise for.

37:44.107 --> 37:45.911
He killed himself,
because of me.

37:50.665 --> 37:51.822
I confronted him.

37:53.736 --> 37:55.270
I said he was disgusting.

37:56.185 --> 37:58.505
Your father fell from his horse.

37:58.775 --> 38:00.180
It was an accident.

38:00.197 --> 38:01.509
It wasn't an accident!

38:02.775 --> 38:06.266
George, your father's death
had nothing to do with you.

38:06.837 --> 38:09.563
Oh, I can't believe,
you carried this

38:09.805 --> 38:11.688
burden, all these years.

38:14.104 --> 38:16.707
It had everything to do,
with his own demons.

38:17.250 --> 38:19.882
He was a man, who
loathed himself.

38:19.899 --> 38:21.422
I was never good enough for him.

38:21.992 --> 38:23.609
I was never manly enough.

38:25.367 --> 38:27.204
I was a failure, in his eye.

38:30.270 --> 38:31.902
George, that's not true.

38:33.973 --> 38:36.269
Your father loved you very much.

38:37.149 --> 38:40.953
He was so hard on you,
because HE was the weak one.

38:42.635 --> 38:44.900
You're not him, George.

38:47.139 --> 38:50.336
George, none of this is
your fault, none of it.

38:52.440 --> 38:54.823
I made the decision, years ago,

38:54.849 --> 38:56.887
that none of this
would be spoken.

38:59.215 --> 39:00.519
And I was wrong.

39:04.733 --> 39:06.272
Can you forgive me?

39:22.174 --> 39:24.056
So many secrets.

39:25.766 --> 39:26.477
Hush.

39:34.861 --> 39:35.880
No more.

39:36.294 --> 39:36.942
Oh hey.

39:37.114 --> 39:40.528
NO, not until you done,
what you came here to do.

39:41.711 --> 39:44.641
I didn't come here, to read
some proposals, sweetheart.

39:46.421 --> 39:49.242
Fine, we will discuss it
like grown-ups, then.

39:49.281 --> 39:51.765
Didn't come here, to
talk about art either.

39:52.094 --> 39:55.019
I couldn't give two
hoots about bloody art.

39:57.348 --> 40:00.316
Ah, well, then this
meeting is over.

40:01.059 --> 40:02.480
You're a beautiful
woman, Carolyn.

40:02.488 --> 40:04.429
Aaaw, don't be a bore.

40:04.474 --> 40:06.945
Aha, ha, ha, who are
you calling a bore?

40:07.059 --> 40:08.863
Ah, I think I've
had enough gin.

40:09.570 --> 40:13.003
Aha, ha, ha, I think you've
had enough too, Dickie.

40:13.406 --> 40:15.039
I like a forceful woman.

40:15.254 --> 40:19.132
Believe it, or not,
sycophants make me sick.

40:19.140 --> 40:20.913
I don't want you, to
pretend you're my equal.

40:20.937 --> 40:21.780
Well, I am your equal.

40:21.806 --> 40:22.864
That's a girl...

40:22.890 --> 40:24.116
Sir Richard, please.

40:24.142 --> 40:26.993
Actually, you're all woman.
You're driving me crazy.

40:27.392 --> 40:28.753
I want you to leave.

40:30.445 --> 40:33.015
Well, don't pretend this
isn't exactly what you want.

40:33.031 --> 40:35.499
You've been playing games
with me for weeks.

40:36.179 --> 40:37.835
Come on, gimme a kiss.

40:38.339 --> 40:41.855
- No, no.
- Aw!

40:42.285 --> 40:44.116
You're a real
firecracker, aren't you?

40:45.672 --> 40:46.956
Let me go !

40:47.332 --> 40:49.261
Aah, I said NO !

40:51.357 --> 40:52.853
No one says no to me !

41:12.601 --> 41:16.131
I must have slept in,
why didn't you wake me?

41:17.901 --> 41:19.534
You want some breakfast?

41:19.560 --> 41:21.583
The vines, they're not
growing like they should.

41:22.456 --> 41:23.678
Gino, what do you mean?

41:23.710 --> 41:25.506
They should look healthier,
there was a frost this morning.

41:25.522 --> 41:28.107
Frost? 
Frost can kill the baby vines.

41:29.947 --> 41:31.493
We should have planted earlier.

41:32.713 --> 41:34.595
Every day Bella, I
look in that corner

41:34.601 --> 41:36.533
and think, that's where
the winery will go.

41:36.588 --> 41:39.785
Darling, it will, just..
it'll take some time.

41:41.462 --> 41:43.368
I better put an extra
blanket on Stardust.

41:43.376 --> 41:44.954
She might get a chill.
Oh, forget the horse !

41:44.970 --> 41:46.977
Get dressed and help me.
Gino?!

41:47.650 --> 41:50.235
I know the vines are our future. 
That horse is just a pet.

42:56.050 --> 42:57.682
You were wrong about me.

42:59.721 --> 43:02.375
I'm going to be the
man you never were.

43:56.270 --> 43:57.097
Coming.

44:04.422 --> 44:05.715
This is a surprise.

44:07.067 --> 44:09.113
May I come in?
Course.

44:15.488 --> 44:17.250
Hospital is buzzing
with the news.

44:17.641 --> 44:19.453
Rene Nordmann going to Sydney.

44:20.008 --> 44:20.892
That's right.

44:34.344 --> 44:36.589
What the hell's that?
I'm sorry.

44:41.324 --> 44:43.504
About last night,
that was my fault.

44:46.860 --> 44:48.288
I was a bloody idiot.

44:50.002 --> 44:51.567
Hate it, when we fight.

44:52.189 --> 44:54.026
I'm sorry, for what I said.

44:56.064 --> 44:56.880
Dr. Duncan,

44:59.003 --> 45:01.180
I'll leave, you get back to work.

45:15.248 --> 45:16.153
Morning.

45:17.177 --> 45:17.993
Good morning.

45:18.556 --> 45:20.384
Thank you for the invitation.
Please.

45:21.025 --> 45:24.056
Morning swim, followed by
breakfast at the Australia Club.

45:25.095 --> 45:26.524
I might have to join.

45:26.603 --> 45:28.220
Well, you need a member,
to nominate you.

45:28.341 --> 45:30.067
I'm afraid, they only allow
the best of the best.

45:30.153 --> 45:31.903
I expect, that rules
me out, then?

45:32.279 --> 45:35.134
I think, you'll be in with a..
..sporting chance.

45:38.923 --> 45:40.692
So, what are you gonna do?

45:41.795 --> 45:42.883
Haven't decided.

45:44.158 --> 45:46.118
Well, you know what I
think, for what it's worth?

45:46.283 --> 45:48.138
I agree with your
fabulous aunt Reggie.

45:48.143 --> 45:49.614
And not just because she
wormed her way into

45:49.640 --> 45:51.629

to anyone else.
