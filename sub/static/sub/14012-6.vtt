OFFICER:
<i> So my brother-in-law</i>

00:19.186 --> 00:21.186
moves into Hell's Kitchen.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.321
Doctor?

00:22.323 --> 00:23.355
The genius.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.024
Quarter-mil on 46th Street.

00:25.026 --> 00:27.159
He says
he's a pioneer.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.428
Hope he's got a gun.

00:31.265 --> 00:34.299
WOMAN:
If I never see another
off-record statement

00:34.301 --> 00:35.467
it will be too soon.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.569
I'm just happy
for the overtime.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.371
We do all the work.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.140
They make
all the bucks.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.042
Come on,
I called a cab.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.043
I'll drop you.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.145
I'm charging it
to a client.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.379
You live in Queens.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.148
Where you gonna drop me?

00:49.150 --> 00:51.150
We'll swing over
to your place...
No, that's okay.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.585
I'm just gonna take a subway.
It's the only exercise I get.

00:53.587 --> 00:54.586
You sure?

00:54.588 --> 00:56.655
Sure, I do it
all the time.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.129
DRIVER:
Where to, lady?

01:04.131 --> 01:05.831
Gooden's pitching.
The kid should see it.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.167
She never heard
of negotiation?

01:08.169 --> 01:09.268
You swap days.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.836
Nope. By the book.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.438
Every other weekend.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.406
I got to call my damn lawyer

01:14.408 --> 01:17.142
to take the kid
to the freakin' zoo.

01:17.144 --> 01:18.644
27 car for a signal 10-56.
DISPATCH:

01:18.646 --> 01:21.180
in the alley.
Corner of Water and Vesey

01:21.182 --> 01:22.281
27 Charlie, 10-4.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.704
Central K,
we have a female down.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.173
Need ambulance on corner
of Water and Vesey.

01:48.175 --> 01:49.308
Roger, 27.
DISPATCH:

01:50.377 --> 01:52.444
(<i> labored breathing</i> )

01:57.618 --> 01:59.651
I'll talk to them
in five.

02:04.191 --> 02:06.191
Call came in
at 1:17.

02:06.193 --> 02:08.193
We were
around the corner.

02:08.195 --> 02:09.261
A mugging?

02:09.263 --> 02:11.296
Too hysterical
to talk.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.731
Where's the caller?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.466
Joined the Silent Majority.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.385
911 anonymous.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.303
Probably used a pay
phone around the corner.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.740
Found it down the block.
License says her
name's Amy Newhouse.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.709
453 West 45th.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.211
I got ten bucks says she's
taking self-defense

02:26.213 --> 02:28.213
at the 92nd Street Y.
You know, I wish

02:28.215 --> 02:30.415
they'd teach these people
it's not worth the fight.

02:30.417 --> 02:33.218
Yeah, well, I doubt this
one put up much of a fight.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.486
What makes you say that?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.621
She's preggo.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.289
Out to here.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.527
Tough town.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.162
(<i> whistles</i> )

02:45.332 --> 02:49.401
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/UNIVERSAL

04:07.414 --> 04:09.414
12 hours in E.R.,
you see everything.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.283
Did you see Amy Newhouse?

04:11.285 --> 04:13.418
Yeah, I admitted her
around 2:00 a.m.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.419
Roughed up,
nothing's broken.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.288
Scratches, scrapes,
bruises.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.423
That's a first
for this rotation.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.425
Looks like the patient
will be just fine.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.427
Paramedics said
she was pregnant.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.429
Yeah, maybe five,
six months.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.365
Well?

04:26.366 --> 04:28.300
Some women sneeze too hard,
it causes a miscarriage.

04:28.302 --> 04:31.303
Others, they run a triathlon,
everything's hunky-dory.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.305
What's that,
a medical term?

04:33.307 --> 04:34.973
Partial abruption
of the fetus.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.976
The placenta starts to separate
from the uterine wall.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.412
We've got her hooked up
to fetal monitors.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.414
All we can do
is wait and see.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.316
You catch the guy?

04:44.318 --> 04:46.618
Nope.
Belongs in a cage.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.421
Talk about
your sociopaths.

04:49.423 --> 04:52.391
This guy kicks her two, maybe
three times right in the belly.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.459
Can you tell us
where can we find her?

04:54.461 --> 04:55.594
Yeah, upstairs, 612 South.

05:02.336 --> 05:05.003
I only had $20.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.005
Credit cards?

05:07.007 --> 05:09.341
I don't have any.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.509
Amy...

05:10.511 --> 05:12.711
can you remember
anything about this man?

05:12.713 --> 05:16.081
How tall he might have been
or something he might have said?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.419
It's okay.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.321
It's all right.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.523
He grabbed me from behind.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.525
I never even saw him.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.494
He took my bag.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.431
The next thing,
I was on the ground.

05:34.368 --> 05:37.402
My baby...

05:37.404 --> 05:40.739
He took your bag
and then he kicked you?

05:42.643 --> 05:46.712
What were you doing out
at that hour?

05:46.714 --> 05:49.781
My boss kept me late.

05:49.783 --> 05:53.985
I work for a law firm--
Wood, Carlton, Troy.

05:55.422 --> 05:56.788
Has anybody
contacted

05:56.790 --> 05:58.490
your husband?

06:01.562 --> 06:03.362
I'm not married.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.097
The father?

06:05.099 --> 06:07.799
Chris.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.534
He's at work.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.002
He's a cabby.

06:13.374 --> 06:17.642
You know, I would have given
that man my money.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.684
What about the baby?

06:25.686 --> 06:28.687
So far, so good.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.089
New York
was Amy's idea.

06:31.091 --> 06:34.059
Saw<i> Working Girl</i>
one too many times.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.429
You think that bunch of lawyers
gives a damn about her

06:37.431 --> 06:39.064
keeping her there
till all hours?

06:39.066 --> 06:42.100
She always walk
to the subway that late?

06:42.102 --> 06:44.803
She's a secretary
of some hotshot partner.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.738
Jerk thinks he owns her.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.808
A million times, I asked her
what she needed that job for

06:49.810 --> 06:51.810
but she wanted the overtime.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.745
Maybe now we can go
back to Wisconsin.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.114
Look, I've got to get
to the hospital.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.752
She's going
to be okay.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.721
The baby is
a question mark.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.724
Great, so for 20 bucks
we might have a murder?

07:05.726 --> 07:07.759
If he already
had her bag

07:07.761 --> 07:09.861
he didn't need
to kick her.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.197
This city is known
for its mental health?

07:12.199 --> 07:14.733
Or maybe somebody had something
else in mind.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.867
Like for instance?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.669
Like causing a miscarriage.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.839
That's a hell of a way
to get your jollies.

07:20.841 --> 07:25.710
We'll run the M.O.
through the assault files.

07:25.712 --> 07:29.548
Could be this started
closer to home.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.151
CRAGEN:
All right.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.053
Talk to the neighbor.

07:35.055 --> 07:38.156
See if you can get
a read on the boyfriend.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.058
I'm sorry.

07:40.060 --> 07:43.161
My hearing, you know.

07:43.163 --> 07:48.733
The best thing about getting old
is you only have to do it once.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.702
(<i> laughing</i> )

07:50.704 --> 07:53.138
Oh, that Amy, oh, she's a doll.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.141
She brings me papers every day.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.576
The stairs, you know.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.778
They're such
a nice young couple

07:59.780 --> 08:02.113
and now a baby.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.850
So Chris was happy
about the baby?

08:04.852 --> 08:07.219
He thought he was too young.

08:07.221 --> 08:10.789
I was his age when I was already
expecting my third.

08:10.791 --> 08:11.823
Mrs. Fisher...

08:11.825 --> 08:14.826
Hmm?

08:14.827 --> 08:17.828
Listen... did you ever hear
anything... you know, strange

08:17.831 --> 08:20.198
coming from
their apartment?

08:20.200 --> 08:26.872
Well, since Sam died,
I only turn these on for guests.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.206
Are you kidding?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.542
The walls
are like toilet paper.

08:30.544 --> 08:31.843
This isn't
exactly Gramercy Park.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.746
Ever hear anything
out of the ordinary?

08:34.748 --> 08:36.665
Put it this way--

08:36.666 --> 08:38.583
every time he's in the mood,
I know about it.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.585
Couple of horny toads.
Ought to be a law.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.153
Any violence?

08:42.155 --> 08:45.290
Yeah, the guy blew his top
every now and again.

08:45.292 --> 08:48.960
Did you ever see Chris
actually hit Amy?

08:48.962 --> 08:53.632
Last spring,
she had a cast on her arm.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.966
And you think

08:54.968 --> 08:56.635
Chris caused that?

08:56.637 --> 08:59.571
She said she fell.

08:59.573 --> 09:01.873
Who am I to say otherwise?

09:05.712 --> 09:08.213
In my opinion,
the guy's a dip.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.749
The fare wanted to go
to Forest Hills

09:10.751 --> 09:12.984
he took them to Forest Lawn.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.853
You kept him on.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.655
Almost a year.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.857
Honest beats smart any time.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.992
Was Chris on duty
Tuesday night?

09:20.994 --> 09:24.563
Uh, graveyard--
12:00 to 8:00.

09:24.565 --> 09:27.265
How much trouble could
he get into after midnight?

09:27.267 --> 09:30.001
Can you tell me
where he was around 1:00?

09:34.274 --> 09:35.874
Somewhere on the L.I.E.

09:35.876 --> 09:39.277
Picked up a fare
at 79th and Columbus.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.912
Took them out to Kennedy.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.614
37 bucks on the meter.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.749
Another 40 coming home.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.354
He was in
the wrong borough

09:49.356 --> 09:51.656
at the time
of the attack.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.758
So much for Ken
popping Barbie.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.893
That's no alibi.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.262
Hey, summer of '82
I hacked part-time

09:57.264 --> 09:58.763
to pay tuition.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.999
Sometimes middle of the
night, I'd get lonely.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.902
I'd park my cab in front
of Janie Meyer's house,

10:03.904 --> 10:05.770
leave the meter running,
go inside

10:05.772 --> 10:08.006
take care of business,
pay the fare myself.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.041
Which would amount
to what, about $2 or $3?

10:10.043 --> 10:13.645
Like going
to Jersey and back.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.280
Let's go talk to the girl.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.917
Back home we had
the real thing-- 120 pounds.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.885
His name was Regis.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.888
He shouldn't have spent
the money,

10:23.890 --> 10:25.890
but that's Chris.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.693
So Chris was happy
about the baby?

10:28.695 --> 10:30.895
Hmm. That's all he talked about.

10:30.897 --> 10:34.799
All he wants out of life
is a wife and half a dozen kids.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.736
Amy, we know about
your broken arm last spring.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.307
You want to tell us
how you got it?

10:42.309 --> 10:44.409
I fell down.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.344
In the middle of a fight?

10:46.346 --> 10:48.680
No, I told you that...

10:48.682 --> 10:49.814
Amy, there's no reason

10:49.816 --> 10:52.017
to protect Chris
if he did this to you.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.686
What do you think--
Chris is an animal?

10:54.688 --> 10:57.756
He wouldn't hurt me or his baby.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.960
LOGAN:
<i> Look...</i>

11:01.962 --> 11:03.328
he hit her once.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.063
He'd hit her again.
This much is clear--

11:05.065 --> 11:06.965
she is lying
about the broken arm.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.334
You think he wanted
to nix the kid?

11:09.336 --> 11:11.269
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wife-beatings are spontaneous.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.371
Are you saying he actually
drove cross town then waited

11:13.373 --> 11:16.041
outside her office
in order to pop her?
All right, a theory.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.376
Chris wasn't as happy
about fatherhood

11:18.378 --> 11:20.078
as Amy would have us believe.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.848
She wouldn't get an abortion,
so it was a do-it-yourself job.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.884
Okay, so he loses his temper
now and then.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.886
But beat her enough
so she'll lose the baby?

11:27.888 --> 11:29.454
Any way you look at it

11:29.456 --> 11:31.790
the wheel stops
at the boyfriend.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.958
He's got buttons. Push them.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.994
I know how it is, Chris.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.996
She ticks you off

11:37.998 --> 11:40.732
so maybe
you lose your temper.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.300
It happens
all the time.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.868
Maybe I hit her once,

11:43.870 --> 11:46.971
but that was a long time ago,
before she got pregnant.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.740
I'd like to believe you

11:48.742 --> 11:51.376
but whoever did this to Amy
had one thing in mind.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.944
You think I would hurt my baby?

11:52.946 --> 11:54.746
Hey, I know how tough it is

11:54.748 --> 11:56.314
raising a family.
You're broke, you're young.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.949
The last thing you
need is someone...

11:57.951 --> 12:00.819
We'd get by.

12:03.123 --> 12:08.727
Chris, if you speak up now,
maybe the D.A. will listen.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.829
The D.A.?

12:10.831 --> 12:12.464
Yeah.

12:12.466 --> 12:13.932
Amy's pressing charges?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.166
Nobody's under arrest.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.901
She knows I couldn't have
done this.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.970
I love her.
I love the baby.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.172
(<i> knock at door</i> )

12:21.174 --> 12:24.476
Amy had a miscarriage.

12:24.478 --> 12:26.411
Oh, God.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.754
If the fetus
was less than 24 weeks old

12:35.756 --> 12:39.190
there's no homicide,
and all we've got is assault.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.391
You've got to be
kidding me.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.143
That's the statute.

12:42.144 --> 12:43.894
That's great.
So, a bunch of lawyers decide

12:43.897 --> 12:45.497
whether you're alive
enough to be murdered.

12:45.499 --> 12:48.500
Better yet,
it could vary
state to state.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.034
Oh, that's wonderful.
Good thing they weren't

12:50.036 --> 12:51.870
traveling cross-country
when he beat her.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.938
Would've been like Tic-Tac-Toe--
here we charge you,

12:53.940 --> 12:56.508
here we don't.
Guys, what do you want me
to tell you?

12:56.510 --> 12:58.944
The law always
makes sense?

12:58.945 --> 13:01.379
Ours is not to question why;
just pick up the garbage.

13:01.381 --> 13:05.817
Fellas, just try to find out
how far along this girl was.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.418
Without the trauma

13:07.420 --> 13:09.420
she would have had
a healthy boy.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.423
Can you tell us if the fetus
was 24 weeks old?

13:12.425 --> 13:15.927
The B.P.D.
is 5.8 centimeters.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.997
Femur lengths 4.4.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.499
In my opinion,
probably about 25 weeks.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.968
In other words, there's no way
to tell for sure?

13:23.970 --> 13:26.004
Did you check
with her regular O.B.?

13:26.006 --> 13:28.406
She said
she didn't have one.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.409
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

13:31.411 --> 13:35.013
We take amnios,
we run sonograms

13:35.015 --> 13:38.016
but the best story
is the old way--

13:38.018 --> 13:39.584
counting backwards.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.520
Amy, the D.A. does not like
hostile witnesses.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.322
There's always a chance

13:44.324 --> 13:46.958
that he's going to charge
you with obstruction.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.827
You don't really want

13:48.829 --> 13:51.429
to go to jail
for Chris, do you?

13:52.966 --> 13:54.866
Okay.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.470
Chris did hit me once.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.908
But it was a long time ago.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.411
He...

14:06.413 --> 14:09.013
he found out I was cheating.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.982
With who?

14:12.419 --> 14:13.952
My boss.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.320
Your current boss,

14:15.322 --> 14:16.588
Mr. Alcott?

14:18.959 --> 14:20.925
It was his baby.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.128
Chris didn't
know that.

14:24.130 --> 14:27.398
Chris thought he was the father.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.035
Was Mr. Alcott in the office
on Tuesday night?

14:32.405 --> 14:35.473
Yeah. He left
ten minutes before I did.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.346
I'm sorry about the mess.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.581
It's been 15-hour days
since November

14:43.583 --> 14:45.383
with the takeover.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.386
Amy said you were with her
the night of the attack.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.021
Yeah.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.023
I heard about the baby.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.558
Look, I, uh,
feel responsible.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.327
I'd kept her here
late that night.

14:56.329 --> 14:59.364
We had to be at the
printer at 8:00 a.m.

14:59.366 --> 15:03.334
I had the temp send her flowers.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.436
What time did you leave?

15:05.438 --> 15:08.006
Oh, must have been
about a quarter of 1:00.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.308
I asked her to finish typing

15:10.309 --> 15:12.609
an opinion letter
and fax it to our
clients in Houston.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.613
I just told her
she could go home.

15:15.615 --> 15:19.550
I knew she liked to walk,
but, you know, at that hour...

15:19.552 --> 15:21.586
See anybody hanging around
outside the building?

15:21.588 --> 15:24.422
No, sorry. Grabbed a cab,
went off to my club.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.057
At 1:00 in the morning?

15:26.059 --> 15:27.625
I live in Mamaroneck.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.061
If I were to go home,
I'd just have to

15:30.063 --> 15:33.064
hop right back on the train and
come back to the city.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.000
I always stay at the club
when I'm forced to work late.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.468
Is that often?

15:37.470 --> 15:39.504
Law isn't 9:00 to 5:00.

15:39.506 --> 15:44.475
So your relationship with Amy
was purely professional, right?

15:44.477 --> 15:47.478
My wife was Summa at Bryn Mawr.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.681
Amy is a sweet young girl.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.549
She's not my type.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.158
CERRETA:
So this is the place
for the other woman, huh?

16:00.160 --> 16:02.160
BARTENDER:
Members have their own rules.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.963
Wives--
they take to the Yale Club

16:04.965 --> 16:06.164
Knickerbocker--

16:06.166 --> 16:08.533
but here, it's strictly
extracurricular.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.468
What about Mr. Alcott?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.136
Nice guy.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.172
Drinks Johnny black,
straight up.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.707
Does he drink it alone?

16:15.709 --> 16:22.080
Look, last year I picked up
an extra ten grand in stock tips

16:22.082 --> 16:24.048
in a down market.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.751
keeping quiet.
A big part of the job's

16:26.753 --> 16:28.152
Yeah, right.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.655
I can get very long-winded

16:30.657 --> 16:33.424
when I pull people in
for questioning.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.059
Sometimes it can go

16:35.061 --> 16:37.428
into the middle
of the evening.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.598
And then if I don't happen
to tell my partner

16:40.600 --> 16:43.001
what I asked you,
that could go... what..?

16:43.003 --> 16:46.104
At least another day.
Oh, yeah.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.473
All right.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.741
Off the record...

16:51.044 --> 16:52.276
Yeah.

16:52.278 --> 16:55.213
Alcott has a good time
now and then.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.647
Ah.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.617
With her?

16:59.619 --> 17:02.153
Yeah.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.055
Miss Meyers and tonic.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.290
Tuesday night--
was he here?

17:06.292 --> 17:08.026
Came in around 1:00.

17:08.028 --> 17:11.629
I'm supposed to close the place,
but what the hell?

17:11.631 --> 17:14.699
He's a regular. Belted down a
couple, hit the rooms upstairs.

17:16.302 --> 17:18.069
Chris isn't my type.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.304
A little too rough
around the edges.

17:20.306 --> 17:23.574
But Amy must have seen
something in him.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.076
They get along?

17:25.078 --> 17:27.078
Used to be pretty rocky.

17:27.080 --> 17:30.081
When Amy got pregnant,
Chris was all lovey-dovey.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.083
What about her boss,
Alcott?

17:33.319 --> 17:34.685
Well, a lawyer.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.254
Enough said.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.057
Amy told us she was seeing him.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.825
She said the baby was his.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.593
Set up an appointment for her

17:42.595 --> 17:45.196
at some fancy Park Avenue
ob-gyn.

17:45.198 --> 17:48.166
He was going to pay
for the whole thing

17:48.168 --> 17:51.202
and send her on a cruise
off to St. Thomas-- real sport.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.770
But she didn't want
an abortion, right?

17:52.772 --> 17:55.306
She didn't want to
go through with it.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.241
Alcott exploded.
The door was closed,

17:57.243 --> 17:59.143
but you
could hear him down the hall.

18:05.151 --> 18:08.086
What now? The security guard
saw us together?

18:08.088 --> 18:10.321
Actually, the bartender
at your club.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.757
I told you-- when
I work late at the office

18:12.759 --> 18:14.759
I spend
the night at the club.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.761
Sometimes Amy brings me papers
from the office.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.863
I bought her a drink.
That doesn't mean we're lovers

18:18.865 --> 18:21.165
and it certainly doesn't mean
that I beat her up.

18:21.167 --> 18:23.534
She says she was carrying
your baby.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.536
She's very convincing.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.639
Yeah? Well, my daughter swears
there's a Tooth Fairy

18:28.641 --> 18:31.142
but that doesn't make it so.

18:32.879 --> 18:37.715
I have clients waiting.
If you don't mind.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.656
Of course he denied it.

18:45.658 --> 18:49.293
I've been a legal secretary
for four years.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.295
They're all risk-adverse.

18:51.297 --> 18:56.200
to submit to a blood test?
You ever ask him

18:56.202 --> 18:59.203
He never questioned
that it was his baby.

18:59.205 --> 19:02.273
At this point he denies
ever having slept with you.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.877
Unfortunately, it comes down
to your word against his.

19:05.879 --> 19:08.146
How appropriate.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.890
He loved to dictate.

19:18.892 --> 19:21.626
The law wasn't the only thing

19:21.628 --> 19:23.327
on his mind.

19:25.832 --> 19:31.235
I thought I might need it
sometime for protection.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.707
With the marital deduction trust
ALCOTT:

19:36.709 --> 19:39.343
to the next generation
the after-tax savings

19:39.345 --> 19:41.279
will be $280,000.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.315
in the shower.
I love to see you naked

19:44.317 --> 19:45.416
Slut.

19:48.354 --> 19:52.190
She's the one who wanted me
to make that tape, you know.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.825
She asked me to do it,
said it made her hot.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.694
Doesn't sound
like she's the only one.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.196
Come on, it was a Christmas
party.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.231
It was the first one I'd
been to in years.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.866
I had a little too much
to drink.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.334
And she was your present?

20:03.336 --> 20:06.737
All right, so I slept with her.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.839
It's been five or six months.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.474
Once she got pregnant?

20:10.476 --> 20:12.476
I put on the brakes
once she got pregnant.

20:12.478 --> 20:15.213
I begged her
to get an abortion.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.948
So it<i> was</i> your baby?

20:16.950 --> 20:19.850
She said she'd stopped sleeping
with her boyfriend.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.352
You believe that?

20:21.354 --> 20:23.754
It's a 50-50 shot.
What am I gonna do?!

20:23.756 --> 20:27.725
I can't afford a paternity suit.
I said I'd help her out

20:27.727 --> 20:29.660
financially--
I could live with that.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.895
True or false--

20:30.897 --> 20:33.364
your life is much easier
if she miscarries?

20:33.366 --> 20:35.233
Hold on now.

20:35.235 --> 20:38.336
No, the boyfriend knew
that she was sleeping around.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.904
He probably did it.

20:39.906 --> 20:43.841
She's lucky
he didn't have a shotgun.

20:43.843 --> 20:48.012
Yes, Chris knew
it was David's baby.

20:48.014 --> 20:51.382
Yeah, so how did he react
when he found out?

20:51.384 --> 20:54.885
He was mad, but...

20:54.887 --> 20:57.955
he didn't hit me.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.423
He didn't do this.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.792
Listen, you been
jerking us around

21:01.794 --> 21:02.860
since day one.

21:05.898 --> 21:09.433
Look... Chris thought

21:09.435 --> 21:11.269
this baby

21:11.271 --> 21:12.737
would make us rich.

21:12.739 --> 21:16.374
He said Alcott would have to pay
for his mistake.

21:16.376 --> 21:19.343
Are you telling us
you blackmailed Alcott?

21:19.345 --> 21:23.814
I didn't want to do it at first,
but Chris said I was entitled.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.016
And did he pay?

21:25.018 --> 21:27.818
$2,000.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.287
We figured

21:29.289 --> 21:31.355
it was like
a security blanket

21:31.357 --> 21:33.324
in case he tried
to fire me.

21:33.326 --> 21:34.725
But Chris kept saying

21:34.727 --> 21:36.961
that this baby
was our meal ticket.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.029
And he was sure

21:38.031 --> 21:40.331
that Alcott
would pay big money

21:40.333 --> 21:42.817
to keep us quiet.

21:42.818 --> 21:45.302
I didn't say anything
before because...

21:45.305 --> 21:48.372
will we have to go to jail?

21:50.877 --> 21:52.476
They're a couple of hayseeds
who thought

21:52.478 --> 21:54.078
they'd squeeze Alcott
for the big bucks.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.980
Alcott had a lot to lose--

21:55.982 --> 21:57.432
money, wife, kids...

21:57.433 --> 21:58.883
Partnership...
CRAGEN:
The other secretary?

21:58.885 --> 22:00.234
Beverly Kern.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.584
...said he has one hell
of a temper.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.270
Alcott left the office

22:03.271 --> 22:04.954
knowing Amy would be down
in a few minutes.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.590
He knew her route home.

22:06.592 --> 22:09.327
He waited in the alley,
and bingo.

22:09.329 --> 22:10.995
Witnesses?

22:10.997 --> 22:12.463
One. Reported the attack,
disappeared.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.465
and opportunity.
So you got motive

22:14.467 --> 22:16.467
It's all circumstantial.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.469
Come on, Paul--
the guy's a lawyer.

22:18.471 --> 22:21.472
He's going to be talking deal
before we slap the cuffs on him.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.873
I'd hock the house on it.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.825
Assault's a possibility.

22:24.826 --> 22:26.776
Murder may still be a stretch
with the 24-week statute.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.813
I'm game if you are.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.020
Go.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.129
Excuse me.
You just can't walk in

22:45.131 --> 22:46.797
without
an appointment...

22:46.799 --> 22:48.966
David Alcott, you are under
arrest for the murder

22:48.968 --> 22:51.369
of the unborn son
of Amy Newhouse.

22:51.371 --> 22:52.503
You have the right

22:52.505 --> 22:54.255
to remain silent.

22:54.256 --> 22:56.006
If you choose to not exercise
that right, anything you say

22:56.008 --> 22:57.608
can and will be
used against you in

22:57.610 --> 22:59.577
a court of law.
You have the right to...

23:02.148 --> 23:05.149
BAILIFF:
Docket # 1422,
<i> People v. David M. Alcott.</i>

23:05.151 --> 23:07.418
The charges are murder
in the second degree

23:07.420 --> 23:08.753
assault in the first degree.

23:08.754 --> 23:10.087
JUDGE:
How does the defendant plead?

23:10.089 --> 23:11.622
This is absurd,
Your Honor.
These char...

23:11.624 --> 23:14.458
This is not
a board room,
Mr. Alcott.

23:14.460 --> 23:17.094
plan to enter a plea?
Mr. Manley, does your client

23:17.096 --> 23:19.563
Not guilty, Your Honor.

23:19.565 --> 23:20.598
Applications.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.833
$250,000 bail, Your Honor.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.168
What?

23:24.170 --> 23:25.703
That is unconscionable.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.738
My client is
an esteemed bar member.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.573
Aren't we all, Mr. Manley?

23:29.575 --> 23:33.611
It would be court-sanctioned
extortion, Your Honor.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.713
The people's case
hardly rises

23:35.715 --> 23:37.515
to the level of frivolity.

23:37.517 --> 23:40.518
Your regard for our
judicial system is admirable.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.487
The bail is set at $100,000.

23:43.489 --> 23:44.822
No way is it murder.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.824
I just talked with Alcott.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.492
You can read minds?

23:48.494 --> 23:50.494
I can read a calendar.

23:50.496 --> 23:52.730
The first time
they slept together?

23:52.732 --> 23:54.198
The Christmas party.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.133
That's 20 weeks
before the attack.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.068
Good theory.
Only she says they started

23:58.070 --> 23:59.737
sleeping together
in early December.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.739
Who do you think
the jury will believe?

24:01.741 --> 24:05.509
Come on!
No witnesses. No evidence.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.111
Even assault is a stretch.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.513
Do everyone a favor.

24:09.515 --> 24:10.514
Menacing.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.616
Under the carpet,
quick and easy.

24:12.618 --> 24:13.784
No time.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.486
A "B" misdemeanor?
Yeah.

24:15.488 --> 24:16.487
Try man one.

24:16.489 --> 24:17.822
He attacked her with intent.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.490
He is innocent, Paul.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.491
Come on.

24:20.493 --> 24:21.725
He has a family

24:21.727 --> 24:23.494
a reputation.

24:23.496 --> 24:26.497
Fine. Tell his family
they get visiting days.

24:26.499 --> 24:28.799
I need Chris and Amy
to convict Alcott.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.802
Why not plead him down
to petty larceny?

24:31.804 --> 24:32.803
Probation.

24:32.805 --> 24:33.871
From extortion?

24:33.873 --> 24:35.873
Already admitted
to blackmailing him.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.141
They're kids, Adam.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.109
A jury will acquit
on sympathy alone.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.111
Even with them,
it's rough sailing.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.646
No physical evidence.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.616
The only eyewitness
vanished.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.084
Alcott's going
into that courtroom

24:47.086 --> 24:48.619
with a suitcase of respect.

24:48.621 --> 24:50.187
That's no defense.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.622
That's reasonable doubt.

24:51.624 --> 24:54.525
Maybe if you want
to make an assault case

24:54.527 --> 24:55.559
but murder...

24:55.561 --> 24:56.894
The statute says 24 weeks.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.496
Manley's got an expert.

24:58.498 --> 24:59.797
He's got his expert.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.198
I've got mine.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.601
You pay enough,
they'll say anything.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.104
AMY:
<i> Chris worked nights.</i>

25:07.106 --> 25:09.507
I worked days.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.208
I was lonely.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.210
David didn't force me.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.679
I wanted to go.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.215
When did you first start
sleeping with Mr. Alcott?

25:18.217 --> 25:19.750
I don't know.

25:19.752 --> 25:22.653
We started working late
on a takeover deal.

25:22.655 --> 25:25.189
It must have been
early December.

25:27.226 --> 25:30.227
And how long
had this been going on?

25:30.229 --> 25:32.196
Maybe a month.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.697
Until I got pregnant.

25:33.699 --> 25:36.233
STONE:
What happened
when you got pregnant?

25:36.235 --> 25:39.970
He told me
I had to get an abortion.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.907
He told me it was
the right thing.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.809
What was your response to that?

25:47.179 --> 25:48.946
I couldn't do it.

25:48.948 --> 25:52.783
And how did Mr. Alcott
react to that?

25:52.785 --> 25:55.786
He threatened to fire me.

25:55.788 --> 26:01.692
But I told him that I would go
to the .

26:01.694 --> 26:05.162
In other words, you thought you
would blackmail the defendant.

26:05.164 --> 26:06.263
He owed us.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.798
He got her pregnant.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.899
He should pay.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.267
What should he pay?

26:10.269 --> 26:11.669
He gave us 2,000.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.704
I told Amy to ask for ten.

26:13.706 --> 26:16.607
And what if he refused?

26:16.609 --> 26:17.942
We'd go to his wife

26:17.944 --> 26:20.611
and then we'd sue
the partnership

26:20.613 --> 26:21.912
for sex discrimination.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.614
He threw her out
of his office.

26:23.616 --> 26:24.915
What did you do?

26:24.917 --> 26:26.917
I went to see him.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.887
I said the price
went up to 20,000.

26:29.889 --> 26:33.724
He said it would be
a cold day in hell

26:33.726 --> 26:35.893
before some white trash
screwed up his life.

26:35.895 --> 26:39.296
He wouldn't give a nickel.

26:39.298 --> 26:42.032
I measured the
biparietal diameter

26:42.034 --> 26:44.201
and the femur lengths
of the fetus.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.803
Indicating what, Doctor?

26:45.805 --> 26:48.639
That the fetus was 25 weeks old.

26:48.641 --> 26:49.740
Thank you.

26:51.611 --> 26:56.647
There are several ways of
determining the age of a fetus.

26:56.649 --> 26:58.649
Isn't that true, Dr. Mishon?

26:58.651 --> 27:01.752
B.P.D. measurements can be
taken interuterally by sonogram

27:01.754 --> 27:04.054
or in a post-rejection
fetus autopsy.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.357
When did you take
these measurements?

27:06.359 --> 27:07.891
In an autopsy.

27:07.893 --> 27:10.294
That certainly is
the more accurate

27:10.296 --> 27:11.295
of the methods.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.329
Ah.

27:12.331 --> 27:15.766
And what is the margin of error

27:15.768 --> 27:19.803
for post-rejection
B.P.D. measurements?

27:19.805 --> 27:22.806
Well, that can vary
with the equipment and...

27:22.808 --> 27:25.676
What is the accepted margin
of error?

27:25.678 --> 27:28.812
Plus or minus
two to three weeks.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.347
So...

27:30.349 --> 27:35.386
Ms. Newhouse's fetus
could have been 22 weeks old.

27:35.388 --> 27:37.688
Isn't that correct?

27:37.690 --> 27:40.257
Yes.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.426
Thank you, Doctor.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.428
Your Honor,
considering the fact

27:44.430 --> 27:48.432
that not even the prosecution's
expert can say with confidence

27:48.434 --> 27:51.969
is at least 24 weeks of age
that the fetus in question

27:51.971 --> 27:54.405
I move that the charge

27:54.407 --> 27:58.442
of murder in the second degree
be dismissed immediately.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.111
Your Honor, Dr. Mishon
has testified...

28:01.113 --> 28:03.013
In my chambers, gentlemen.

28:03.015 --> 28:07.017
Mr. Stone knows he should not
have brought those charges.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.853
It's obvious he's
only trying to back in

28:09.855 --> 28:11.989
to the lesser-charged felony.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.991
He should have raised this issue
in pretrial motions.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.711
Oh, be serious, Ben.

28:16.712 --> 28:19.430
I can parade a dozen experts
through that courtroom.

28:19.432 --> 28:22.766
You only tacked on murder
to outrage the jury.

28:22.768 --> 28:25.836
Now they'd convict him
for killing J.F.K.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.838
for God's sakes.
The age of the fetus

28:27.840 --> 28:31.008
is a question of fact
for the jury.

28:31.010 --> 28:33.110
of law for me.
it's a question
No, Mr. Stone,

28:33.112 --> 28:37.815
The defendant's motion
is granted.

28:38.951 --> 28:41.418
There's nothing we can do?

28:41.420 --> 28:42.953
The statute is clear.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.855
But medical science,
unfortunately, is not.

28:44.857 --> 28:47.858
You mean if it happened
two weeks later

28:47.860 --> 28:49.460
he'd go to jail?

28:49.462 --> 28:51.462
The assault charges
weren't dismissed.

28:51.464 --> 28:53.764
He can serve
five to 15.

28:53.766 --> 28:56.033
Five years for a life?

28:56.035 --> 28:58.135
We heard the heart beat.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.803
We felt the kicks.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.939
I'm sorry, Amy.

29:04.744 --> 29:07.044
Manley's smart.

29:07.045 --> 29:09.345
Get an assault conviction,
and he claims any evidence

29:09.348 --> 29:11.782
relating to the loss of the
fetus was improper.

29:11.784 --> 29:14.384
ROBINETTE:
That's why he didn't object

29:14.386 --> 29:16.787
to the charge prior to trial.

29:16.789 --> 29:19.790
If it's a mistrial,
Alcott walks away untouched.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.492
(<i> phone rings</i> )

29:24.463 --> 29:26.063
Yes?

29:26.065 --> 29:28.766
Thank you.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.168
Not quite untouched.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.170
Chris and Amy just filed

29:33.172 --> 29:35.172
a $10-million lawsuit
against Alcott.

29:35.174 --> 29:37.174
Retained council,
Jacob Bloom.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.209
The King of Torts?

29:39.211 --> 29:43.847
The Prince of Darkness.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.182
The woman miscarried.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.151
We're talking
major league suffering.

29:47.153 --> 29:50.053
Not to mention the lifetime
earnings potential

29:50.055 --> 29:51.955
of a healthy white male.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.791
You win the criminal side.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.092
Cuts my work in half.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.544
I'm rooting for you.

29:56.545 --> 29:57.995
Mr. Alcott
is bucking

29:57.997 --> 30:00.030
for a mistrial.

30:00.031 --> 30:02.064
This kind of publicity
won't hurt his cause.

30:02.067 --> 30:04.001
You've got
no limitations problem.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.502
You could have waited.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.905
Is this jealousy I'm hearing?

30:07.907 --> 30:09.890
It's nausea.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.874
Ambulance-chasing
brings that out in me.

30:11.877 --> 30:15.212
Whoa, better check
your playbill, Mr. Robinette.

30:15.214 --> 30:16.980
Your friends came to me

30:16.982 --> 30:20.050
the day after she got out
of the hospital.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.588
I had a hell of a time

30:24.590 --> 30:29.893
convincing her to wait
for the criminal case to begin.

30:29.895 --> 30:32.863
That was a pretty short
period of mourning.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.865
When my secretary's cat
died

30:34.867 --> 30:37.201
she took a week off
from work.

30:37.203 --> 30:38.869
A million-dollar damages.

30:38.871 --> 30:41.205
It's the American dream,
I guess

30:41.207 --> 30:45.008
but some people will make it
any way they can.

30:45.010 --> 30:48.145
There's always the chance
that she's suing on principle.

30:48.147 --> 30:51.148
What do we know
about Amy Newhouse anyway?

30:51.150 --> 30:53.851
Some firms
have switched to H.M.O.s

30:53.853 --> 30:56.854
but we still stand by your
basic health coverage.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.155
So checkups aren't covered?

30:58.157 --> 31:00.591
Not unless
they find something wrong.

31:00.593 --> 31:03.627
Here we go... Amy Newhouse
put in a claim February 3.

31:03.629 --> 31:06.597
The company reimbursed
her on the 18th.

31:06.599 --> 31:08.131
There was something wrong?

31:08.133 --> 31:11.068
Well, for most people,
pregnancy is a blessing.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.570
Insurance companies
call it a disability.

31:13.572 --> 31:16.573
Do you have
her doctor's name?

31:16.575 --> 31:17.574
Bernard Gluck.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.142
36th and 3rd.

31:21.580 --> 31:22.980
<i> Amy Newhouse.</i>

31:25.050 --> 31:26.516
Healthy young girl.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.051
Everything was fine.

31:28.053 --> 31:31.021
On February 3,
you told her she was pregnant?

31:31.023 --> 31:32.990
That was the checkup.

31:32.991 --> 31:34.958
I told her she was pregnant
back in December-- the 19th.

31:34.960 --> 31:38.929
That boyfriend of hers--
he nearly jumped for joy.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.631
I haven't seen her since.
How's she doing?

31:40.633 --> 31:42.900
Not too well.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.637
Letter read Barsky family trust.
ALCOTT:

31:46.639 --> 31:48.639
As per my prior communication

31:48.641 --> 31:51.642
will benefit two generations
the tax savings

31:51.644 --> 31:55.178
of the generation-skipping tax.
without running afoul

31:55.180 --> 31:57.080
Last night was spectacular.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.081
You were right.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.549
It was worth the wait.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.618
Better than I ever imagined.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.620
The first sight of you naked...

32:03.622 --> 32:04.988
(<i> stops tape</i> )

32:04.990 --> 32:07.624
So, what? We admit it;
he had the affair.

32:07.626 --> 32:10.294
It sounds like you dictated
that letter

32:10.296 --> 32:13.163
the day after
your first night with Amy.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.631
There is a point to this?

32:14.633 --> 32:17.167
It was dated
the 23rd of December.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.970
The day after
the Christmas party.

32:19.972 --> 32:22.639
How many times do I have
to tell you?

32:22.641 --> 32:24.708
I told you she was lying.

32:24.710 --> 32:27.210
There is no way
the baby was 24 weeks.

32:27.212 --> 32:30.113
You made me jump through hoops
for nothing.

32:30.115 --> 32:33.183
Save the theatrics, Jerry.
The murder charges
were dismissed.

32:33.185 --> 32:35.202
The point is her doctor

32:35.203 --> 32:37.220
says she was already pregnant
on the 19th of December.

32:37.222 --> 32:38.322
That little...

32:38.324 --> 32:41.124
I want
this case dropped immediately

32:41.126 --> 32:43.260
<i> and</i> I want a public apology.

32:43.262 --> 32:46.163
So the baby
couldn't have been mine.

32:50.035 --> 32:52.669
They knew all along
Chris was the father.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.005
They set Alcott up
for blackmail.

32:55.007 --> 32:56.573
Doesn't affect his guilt.
What's important is

32:56.575 --> 32:58.442
that he thought
the baby was his.

32:58.444 --> 33:02.079
The creeps manipulate
this office, the police,
Alcott from the start.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.747
All right,
they're liars.

33:03.749 --> 33:06.116
Doesn't make them killers.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.251
Maybe the blackmail
was camouflage.

33:08.253 --> 33:09.987
Maybe their
ultimate goal

33:09.989 --> 33:11.989
is a civil suit.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.990
There may be more to Chris
than we originally thought.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.993
He practiced law in Wisconsin.

33:15.995 --> 33:18.028
And now

33:18.030 --> 33:19.663
he's driving a cab?

33:19.665 --> 33:22.032
Disbarred in '89.

33:22.034 --> 33:24.201
What are you going to do, Ben?

33:24.203 --> 33:26.636
Well, straightforward
won't work.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.739
We got to hit him
from behind.

33:28.741 --> 33:32.542
If the light at the end
of that tunnel was a civil suit

33:32.544 --> 33:34.277
why not seal up
the tunnel?

33:34.279 --> 33:36.546
Judge Burton
owes you a favor.

33:36.548 --> 33:37.547
Call one in.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.049
Get me a continuance.

33:39.051 --> 33:42.219
What the hell
is his wife's... Sally.

33:43.489 --> 33:47.090
Your husband may be guilty
of many things, Mrs. Alcott,

33:47.092 --> 33:49.493
but we're not convinced
one of them

33:49.495 --> 33:51.495
is attacking
a pregnant woman.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.563
You're not required
to help them.

33:53.565 --> 33:56.033
No, you're not, but I'm
sure your attorney

33:56.035 --> 33:59.803
has told you that cause
has no bearing on the
property distribution.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.805
In books, Mr. Robinette.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.574
In real life,
it goes a long way.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.243
You'll get your divorce.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.711
You'll get his money

34:07.713 --> 34:10.047
but the penalties for adultery

34:10.049 --> 34:12.616
do not include
25 years behind bars.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.251
Maybe they should.

34:14.253 --> 34:17.254
Maybe then they would
keep their pants on.

34:17.256 --> 34:21.258
David will pay for this,
Mr. Robinette.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.526
Fine.

34:22.528 --> 34:25.296
If he goes to jail

34:25.297 --> 34:28.065
Chris and Amy's civil suit
against him is a sure winner

34:28.067 --> 34:31.168
and in that case
there will be a lot less

34:31.170 --> 34:34.304
to divide up
after the divorce.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.773
What are you proposing?

34:36.775 --> 34:39.109
I'm sure it doesn't
surprise you

34:39.111 --> 34:42.079
that Mrs. Alcott has commenced
a divorce proceeding

34:42.081 --> 34:43.346
against her husband.

34:43.348 --> 34:45.832
You want Amy
to testify?

34:45.833 --> 34:48.317
As a matter of fact, no. I want
you to drop the civil suit.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.221
Why in the world would we...

34:51.223 --> 34:52.756
For a million dollars.
That's why.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.658
We're suing
for ten million.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.559
First of all, let me assure you
Mr. Alcott's net worth

34:56.562 --> 34:57.761
is barely $2,000,000

34:57.763 --> 35:00.730
half of which I'm claiming
for Mrs. Alcott

35:00.732 --> 35:02.299
in her divorce.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.234
Fraudulent conveyance.

35:04.236 --> 35:06.570
We'll recapture the funds.

35:06.572 --> 35:07.771
Very good, Chris,

35:07.773 --> 35:09.339
but I want
you to know

35:09.341 --> 35:11.108
I can tie up
his assets

35:11.110 --> 35:13.110
for years pending the divorce
settlement.

35:13.112 --> 35:16.279
I've got a restraining order
on his bank accounts.

35:16.281 --> 35:19.783
His partnership draw
is being garnished

35:19.785 --> 35:21.785
and tomorrow,
we start

35:21.787 --> 35:24.721
on maintenance
and child support.

35:24.723 --> 35:27.190
I wouldn't mess with me if I
were you, Chris.

35:27.192 --> 35:29.893
By the time you see a dime,
it won't be worth a nickel.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.795
And what's in it for you?

35:31.797 --> 35:33.797
Mrs. Alcott will drop
the divorce proceeding.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.399
I'll let the son of a bitch
rot in jail

35:36.401 --> 35:38.902
while I spend
whatever money he has left.

35:38.904 --> 35:42.205
LAWYER:
Take a million now.

35:42.207 --> 35:46.209
and everybody's happy.
Drop the civil suit

35:46.211 --> 35:49.312
It was hardly worth the trouble.
AMY:

35:49.314 --> 35:51.681
So much for suing on principle.

35:51.683 --> 35:54.284
These two are
unbelievable.

35:55.687 --> 35:59.289
LAWYER:
for you tomorrow.k

35:59.291 --> 36:04.594
and get out of here.
Let's just take the money
AMY:

36:04.596 --> 36:06.796
The grieving mother.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.665
Does that constitute proof?

36:08.667 --> 36:11.401
Couldn't they say
they got over it quickly?

36:11.403 --> 36:14.304
Chris was the father,
not Alcott.

36:14.306 --> 36:16.773
Chris and Amy knew that, but
made Alcott think it was his.

36:16.775 --> 36:18.825
In order
to blackmail him.

36:18.826 --> 36:20.876
In order to file a civil suit.
They weren't going for singles.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.780
These people were going for the
long ball-- extra bases.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.415
Staging this whole thing.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.250
That's a hell of a couple.

36:27.252 --> 36:31.321
So this whole thing was a scam--
the beating, the affair?

36:31.323 --> 36:32.455
My guess--

36:32.457 --> 36:34.257
Chris was the
anonymous caller.

36:34.259 --> 36:36.259
We need you
to break his alibi.

36:36.261 --> 36:38.662
You're the ex-cabby.

36:41.233 --> 36:42.332
Get me the book.

36:42.334 --> 36:43.867
For insurance purpose

36:43.869 --> 36:46.336
we check the odometer
of every cab

36:46.338 --> 36:48.838
when it comes in,
when it goes out.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.840
Every cab
every day, huh?

36:50.842 --> 36:52.676
You screw up
the insurance

36:52.678 --> 36:55.345
they take away
your medallion like that.

36:55.347 --> 36:57.881
Cab 34. Be my guest.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.889
Guess what. He's only half as
smart as we thought.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.692
The kid paid off the meter,
but he didn't know

37:08.694 --> 37:10.227
they check
the mileage every day.

37:10.229 --> 37:13.230
The only way he trekked out
to Kennedy Airport

37:13.232 --> 37:15.498
is if they moved it
to Times Square.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.467
The odometer's
40 miles short.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.469
Then so is his alibi.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.471
Read them
their rights.

37:21.473 --> 37:24.241
We've already pled them out
on blackmail.

37:24.243 --> 37:27.244
Experts cannot establish
the age of the fetus

37:27.246 --> 37:29.679
so murder's
out of the question, too.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.348
Is this
true or false--

37:31.350 --> 37:34.351
Amy and Chris intended
to cause a miscarriage.

37:34.353 --> 37:37.254
True, only what they did
wasn't a crime.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.022
But they didn't know that.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.424
Famous law school hypothetical.

37:41.426 --> 37:44.294
I shoot a bullet
into the heart of a man

37:44.296 --> 37:46.029
who appears to be sleeping

37:46.031 --> 37:48.331
only he wasn't
sleeping

37:48.333 --> 37:49.399
he was dead.

37:49.401 --> 37:50.467
Am I guilty?

37:50.469 --> 37:51.801
Not of murder.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.503
But I didn't know he
was already dead.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.939
<i> I</i> thought
I was committing a crime.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.441
Chris and Amy thought
they were committing a crime.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.877
So they had a guilty mind.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.446
If not for murder, for...?

38:03.448 --> 38:05.015
Attempted murder.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.818
Learn from your past
mistakes, Stone.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.820
The fetus wasn't legally alive,

38:10.822 --> 38:13.290
ergo you can't
make it legally dead,

38:13.292 --> 38:15.425
ergo you can't
convict on murder.

38:15.427 --> 38:18.495
No one is disagreeing
with you, Miss Bayliss,

38:18.497 --> 38:21.998
but if you read the indictment,
your clients are charged
with<i> attempted</i> murder.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.067
Same difference.

38:24.069 --> 38:26.019
I don't think so.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.970
A man buys a pound of sugar,
thinking it's heroin.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.974
We all know it's no crime to buy
a pound of sugar

38:30.976 --> 38:33.510
but Miss Bayliss, in every
jurisdiction in the country,

38:33.512 --> 38:36.446
the man<i> is</i> convicted
of attempted possession
of illegal narcotics.

38:36.448 --> 38:37.947
CHRIS:
Yes, Mr. Stone.

38:37.949 --> 38:41.551
But if your man knew
for a fact it was sugar

38:41.553 --> 38:43.520
he's as free as a bird.

38:43.522 --> 38:46.323
AMY:
I hate to spoil your fun,
Mr. Stone,

38:46.325 --> 38:49.859
but I assure you,
after three years of law school

38:49.861 --> 38:53.063
Chris knows how to read
a murder statute

38:53.065 --> 38:57.067
and I certainly knew
how long I'd been pregnant.

38:57.069 --> 38:59.102
She sat there and admitted
she killed her own baby.

38:59.104 --> 39:02.806
I swear her pulse didn't rise
above 60.
They knew both the age

39:02.808 --> 39:05.108
of the fetus and the law.
No murder, no attempt.

39:05.110 --> 39:08.812
They have proof?
She had an O.B. confirm
her home pregnancy test

39:08.814 --> 39:12.015
plus our young hero
Chris's statement that
he knew the statute.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.884
Are you telling me
that a woman that smart

39:14.886 --> 39:17.020
would willingly
sacrifice her body?

39:17.022 --> 39:18.588
That's hard to believe.

39:18.590 --> 39:19.789
Bed and brains

39:19.791 --> 39:21.458
are not mutually
exclusive.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.859
Maybe she was abused

39:22.861 --> 39:25.495
but she was part of this
from the start.

39:25.497 --> 39:28.965
If she couldn't form
the intent, if she was
acting under Chris's will?

39:28.967 --> 39:30.400
Well, you saw her.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.969
That baby was
no more important to her

39:32.971 --> 39:35.438
than a watch, something she
could hock for a quick buck.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.073
We got to go
forward with this.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.843
You fire an unloaded gun at me,
it's attempt.

39:39.845 --> 39:42.812
You know that the gun
is not loaded, it's nothing.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.381
But to be acquitted,
I'd have to prove

39:44.383 --> 39:46.015
to a jury that I knew the gun
wasn't loaded.

39:46.017 --> 39:48.017
Chris and Amy will have to prove
that they knew they weren't

39:48.019 --> 39:49.919
committing a crime, and
they'll have to take the stand.

39:49.921 --> 39:52.088
Credibility is a question
for the jury.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.457
Exactly. I open up the slightest
hole in their story,

39:54.459 --> 39:58.395
I give the jury the opportunity,
they'll do the right thing.

39:58.397 --> 40:00.096
You want them
to ignore evidence?

40:00.098 --> 40:03.400
No. Chris and Amy want the jury
to look at the law.

40:03.402 --> 40:06.002
I'll get the jury
to look at Chris and Amy.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.071
The law's supposed
to be a shield,
not a sword.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.573
They're despicable, yes,
but by letter of the law

40:10.575 --> 40:12.575
they're not guilty.

40:12.577 --> 40:15.078
The legislature
couldn't have conceived

40:15.080 --> 40:17.414
anything like this, but wrong
should not win

40:17.416 --> 40:19.015
by technicalities,
you know that yourself.

40:20.519 --> 40:22.986
Get these bastards
off the street.

40:26.091 --> 40:29.893
CHRIS:
<i> went wrongat if everything</i>

40:29.895 --> 40:31.060
and Amy miscarried

40:31.062 --> 40:32.662
we couldn't
be tried for murder.

40:32.664 --> 40:36.099
We knew Amy had been pregnant
less than 24 weeks.

40:36.101 --> 40:39.936
But you're not charged
with murder, Chris.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.005
You're charged
with attempt.

40:42.007 --> 40:43.990
It's a joke.

40:43.991 --> 40:45.974
You think we would
go through all this

40:45.977 --> 40:47.110
and not be sure?

40:47.112 --> 40:49.212
I knew it wasn't a crime.

40:49.214 --> 40:50.580
How's that?

40:50.582 --> 40:51.681
Three years

40:51.683 --> 40:54.050
University of Wisconsin
School of Law

40:54.052 --> 40:56.653
two years practicing
in Fond Du Lac.

40:56.655 --> 40:57.954
Thank you.

40:59.591 --> 41:01.591
As an attorney, you are aware

41:01.593 --> 41:05.228
that the definition of murder
varies from state to state.
Sure.

41:05.230 --> 41:07.630
What constitutes murder
in Wisconsin

41:07.632 --> 41:09.666
may be different in New York.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.168
That's right.

41:11.169 --> 41:12.669
Did you attend
law school in New York?

41:12.671 --> 41:13.736
No, but I...

41:13.738 --> 41:15.472
Yes or no, sir.

41:16.741 --> 41:18.942
No.

41:18.944 --> 41:21.211
But you claim to know the law

41:21.213 --> 41:22.479
in New York.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.180
I can read, Mr. Stone.

41:24.182 --> 41:27.217
Well then, maybe
you can tell us, Mr. Baylor,

41:27.219 --> 41:30.553
what happened to your license
to practice law.

41:30.555 --> 41:32.088
Objection. Irrelevant.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.490
Goes to credibility,
Your Honor.

41:33.492 --> 41:35.492
Answer the question.

41:35.494 --> 41:38.061
It was revoked.

41:38.063 --> 41:40.096
You mean, you were disbarred?

41:43.502 --> 41:44.501
Sir?

41:49.641 --> 41:54.244
I made a terrible mistake,
but we didn't break any laws.

41:54.246 --> 41:58.248
But you testified that Chris
intentionally hit you.

41:58.250 --> 42:00.984
You said it was all
part of your plan.

42:00.986 --> 42:03.686
We never meant to hurt it.

42:03.688 --> 42:07.991
I am so sorry about the baby.

42:07.993 --> 42:10.960
I wish I could
take it back.

42:10.962 --> 42:13.029
And what about
Mr. Alcott?

42:13.031 --> 42:15.665
Does he deserve any sympathy?

42:15.667 --> 42:16.799
I take it

42:16.801 --> 42:18.668
you don't care for him.

42:18.670 --> 42:20.537
He cheated on his wife.

42:20.539 --> 42:22.272
He cheats the government

42:22.274 --> 42:23.540
for a living.

42:23.542 --> 42:26.743
He deserves whatever
happens to him.

42:31.049 --> 42:35.652
Amy, have you been examined
by a doctor recently?

42:35.654 --> 42:38.688
Yes.

42:38.690 --> 42:41.090
And what did he say?

42:41.092 --> 42:43.059
As a result of the kicks

42:43.061 --> 42:46.262
there was severe damage
to my uterine wall.

42:46.264 --> 42:47.764
Which means?

42:47.766 --> 42:49.732
I'll never have another child.

42:49.734 --> 42:50.733
Objection.

42:50.735 --> 42:51.668
Relevance.

42:51.670 --> 42:53.136
Sustained.

42:53.138 --> 42:54.637
Thank you, Amy.

42:57.576 --> 43:00.710
Miss Newhouse, you testified

43:00.712 --> 43:06.015
that you didn't intend
to have a miscarriage.

43:06.017 --> 43:09.152
Yet you meticulously
planned the attack

43:09.154 --> 43:13.790
to assure that the fetus
would be under 24 weeks of age.

43:13.792 --> 43:15.858
Chris said it was a failsafe

43:15.860 --> 43:18.328
just in case
something went wrong.

43:18.330 --> 43:21.364
Can you tell us
why Chris was disbarred

43:21.366 --> 43:23.633
in the state
of Wisconsin?

43:26.071 --> 43:28.338
Answer the question, please.

43:34.045 --> 43:38.648
Um... subornation of perjury.

43:38.650 --> 43:40.817
STONE:
You know what that means?

43:42.354 --> 43:45.888
He encouraged a witness
to lie on the stand.

43:45.890 --> 43:47.290
Do you think

43:47.292 --> 43:49.292
Chris could be at it again?

43:49.294 --> 43:50.793
Objection.

43:50.795 --> 43:52.395
Sustained.

43:54.666 --> 43:57.266
Miss Newhouse, do you know
what it means

43:57.268 --> 43:58.401
if you can't prove

43:58.403 --> 44:01.070
that you and Chris
knew the law prior

44:01.072 --> 44:02.372
to committing
the acts

44:02.374 --> 44:05.174
that resulted in the death
of your baby?

44:05.176 --> 44:06.743
Objection!

44:06.744 --> 44:08.311
The witness is
not an attorney, Your Honor.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.713
She is not competent
to determine this.

44:10.715 --> 44:12.048
On the contrary,
Your Honor.

44:12.049 --> 44:13.382
Miss Newhouse's entire defense
is based

44:13.385 --> 44:15.785
upon the fact
that she knew the law.

44:15.787 --> 44:17.387
She cannot now argue

44:17.389 --> 44:21.124
that she is incompetent
to testify as to its meaning.

44:21.126 --> 44:23.259
Answer the question,
young lady.

44:27.399 --> 44:29.198
What would it mean

44:29.200 --> 44:32.702
Miss Newhouse,
if you didn't know the law?

44:32.704 --> 44:34.303
We would be guilty.

44:34.305 --> 44:35.838
Of what?

44:37.709 --> 44:39.676
Of attempted murder.

44:39.678 --> 44:41.711
Of trying to kill your own baby.

44:41.713 --> 44:45.415
We committed no crime.

44:45.417 --> 44:48.751
Nobody got hurt.

45:03.968 --> 45:06.335
STONE:
<i> No crime?</i>

45:06.337 --> 45:08.337
What do you call the plan

45:08.339 --> 45:12.341
that Christopher Baylor
and Amy Newhouse concocted?

45:12.343 --> 45:14.310
They lured her own employer,
David Alcott,

45:14.312 --> 45:16.245
into having an affair with her.

45:16.247 --> 45:19.782
They convinced him
that their own pregnancy was his

45:19.784 --> 45:23.886
and then,
they did the unimaginable.

45:23.888 --> 45:26.489
They staged an attack--

45:26.491 --> 45:28.958
an attack
in which Christopher Baylor

45:28.960 --> 45:31.861
savagely kicked the mother
of his own child

45:31.863 --> 45:33.362
in the belly

45:33.364 --> 45:38.301
and they say it's no crime.

45:38.303 --> 45:42.238
They killed
their own child for greed.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.806
No crime?

45:43.808 --> 45:47.477
The only possible way
that this is not a crime

45:47.479 --> 45:50.413
is if you can manage
to convince yourself

45:50.415 --> 45:53.316
that couple
had specific knowledge

45:53.318 --> 45:55.218
of an obscure penal code.

45:55.220 --> 45:58.855
I, however, believe
that if you review the evidence

45:58.857 --> 46:00.189
you will find

46:00.191 --> 46:03.326
that when they came up
with this heinous plan

46:03.328 --> 46:09.332
they were unaware
of the 24-week statute

46:09.334 --> 46:11.934
and that they are guilty
of the crime

46:11.936 --> 46:14.437
that was in their hearts
all along--

46:14.439 --> 46:17.406
the crime of attempted murder.

46:21.913 --> 46:23.946
Have you reached a verdict?

46:23.948 --> 46:24.947
We have, Your Honor.

46:24.949 --> 46:27.016
We find the defendants,

46:27.018 --> 46:29.051
Amy Newhouse
and Christopher Baylor,

46:29.053 --> 46:32.455
guilty of attempt to commit
murder in the second degree.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.323
Motion to set aside
the verdict.

46:34.325 --> 46:36.359
Denied.

46:39.063 --> 46:41.931
Gillion should have
set aside the verdict.
The only basis was horror.

46:41.933 --> 46:43.533
The public is all over us

46:43.535 --> 46:46.302
when a known criminal walks
on a technicality.

46:46.304 --> 46:49.806
I just flipped the coin--
I let the people use a
technicality to convict.

46:49.808 --> 46:51.407
I'm sure they'll appeal.

46:51.409 --> 46:53.876
The jury disbelieved
their testimony.

46:53.878 --> 46:56.045
Last time I looked, that is not
reviewable on appeal.

46:56.047 --> 46:57.914
But they were
telling the truth.

46:57.916 --> 47:00.950
I won't lose sleep over
it, and I don't think
the jurors will, either.

47:00.952 --> 47:02.351
There's another
bit of justice.

47:02.353 --> 47:03.352
What's that?

47:03.354 --> 47:05.955
She'll never reproduce.
