WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:02.267
Previously on SEAL Team...

00:02.300 --> 00:03.324
I'm Clay.
Stella.

00:03.370 --> 00:06.237
Stella?
Mm-hmm.

00:06.270 --> 00:07.794
And this is what,
like, our third date?

00:07.840 --> 00:09.239
This is a date?
(chuckles)

00:09.270 --> 00:10.168
(chuckles)

00:10.210 --> 00:11.563
Until you graduate Green Team,

00:11.610 --> 00:13.100
you're a member of Chalk 2,

00:13.140 --> 00:15.176
Alpha Platoon, SEAL Team 3.
Damn right.

00:15.210 --> 00:16.746
RAY: Look, man, you can't deny
the kid's talent.

00:16.780 --> 00:18.543
JASON: Or his ego.
He keeps pressing the red

00:18.580 --> 00:19.808
like that, you know
what he's gonna do?

00:19.850 --> 00:22.239
He's gonna hit a wall. He's
gonna slow his whole team down.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.484
Are you sure
you're not threatened

00:23.520 --> 00:25.442
'cause he's faster than you?
Threatened? (scoffs)

00:25.490 --> 00:27.185
Triple my rucksack,
and I'll still

00:27.220 --> 00:29.381
beat his ass up that hill, Ray.

00:33.230 --> 00:35.255
* I'm Ulysses Jones

00:35.300 --> 00:36.426
* I got blood lock bones...

00:36.470 --> 00:38.426
"Adele Dazeem"?

00:38.470 --> 00:40.768
Yep. Apparently
that's what he said.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.836
Travolta?

00:42.870 --> 00:45.202
(chuckles)
That's not even close.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.832
Yeah, well, what do you
want me to tell you?

00:46.880 --> 00:50.372
Maybe the Grecian Formula
leached into his brain.

00:50.410 --> 00:52.275
Aanay, Colby,

00:52.320 --> 00:54.072
one of the comms guys
from Bagram,

00:54.120 --> 00:56.418
says it's all anyone's
talking about online.

00:56.450 --> 00:59.214
Oscars was when?
Like, last Monday?

00:59.260 --> 01:00.784
(chuckles) Sunday, bro.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.287
Sunday.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.286
(laughs) Even worse.

01:04.330 --> 01:06.321
Pulp Fiction
gets some chick's name wrong.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.395
Five days later,
the whole world's

01:07.430 --> 01:08.829
still talking about it?

01:08.860 --> 01:11.567
Meanwhile, we're out here
getting our asses shot off.

01:11.600 --> 01:15.388
Might as well
be a fart in the wind.

01:15.440 --> 01:18.102
You know, too much sun exposure

01:18.140 --> 01:19.334
can lead to premature aging.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.779
How about
sleeping in a hooch

01:20.810 --> 01:22.801
that got mortared
14 times last month?

01:26.620 --> 01:28.315
You're in my light, bro.

01:28.350 --> 01:30.238
Dude, out of my light.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.155
Aren't you supposed
to relieve us on watch?

01:32.190 --> 01:34.488
No. Garner's up.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.555
Where is he right now?

01:35.590 --> 01:38.855
(sighs) Where is he ever?

01:46.470 --> 01:48.597
(rock music bleeds
from headphones)

01:48.640 --> 01:51.336
*

01:51.370 --> 01:54.339
Garner, you're on watch.

01:57.310 --> 01:58.846
Got it.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.751
(man shouting indistinctly)

02:14.660 --> 02:16.662
(helicopter flying overhead)

02:18.670 --> 02:21.389
Hey.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.702
Yep.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.221
(indistinct chatter, grunting)

02:49.230 --> 02:51.494
Hey, it could be worse.

02:51.530 --> 02:53.634
What's that?

02:53.670 --> 02:55.365
Guys up for
the NFL draft,

02:55.400 --> 02:57.937
all the time just waiting
for their name to be called,

02:57.970 --> 02:59.972
and their face is
on the TV camera.

03:00.010 --> 03:02.547
You really think I'm sitting
here sweating the draft,

03:02.580 --> 03:04.502
wondering about which team
I'm gonna end up on?

03:04.550 --> 03:05.847
You're saying you're not?

03:05.880 --> 03:07.245
Matter of fact,
I'm just thinking about

03:07.280 --> 03:08.508
finding a place to live.

03:10.350 --> 03:13.410
You got a team
you're hoping drafts you?

03:13.460 --> 03:16.452
I haven't given it
much thought.

03:16.490 --> 03:18.424
Whatever teams we go to,

03:18.460 --> 03:21.918
we're Tier One operators
now, baby.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.461
How about you?

03:23.500 --> 03:24.967
How about me what?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.433
You got a team
you're hoping for,

03:26.470 --> 03:27.459
or you figure
it's a done deal--

03:27.500 --> 03:28.489
you end up with Hayes
and his guys

03:28.540 --> 03:30.565
'cause you already rolled
with them the once?

03:33.540 --> 03:35.474
No, I haven't really
thought about it.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.451
RAY: Ha. Looks like
our boy made it.

03:50.490 --> 03:52.526
WILKINS: As I'm sure
most of you remember,

03:52.560 --> 03:53.857
Charlie Team had
first pick

03:53.900 --> 03:56.596
in last year's
Green Team draft.
Boo. Garbage.

03:56.630 --> 03:58.427
The rich get richer.
This year,

03:58.470 --> 04:00.836
the "one" pick belongs
to Bravo Team.
I'm sorry, who?

04:00.870 --> 04:02.804
Bravo Team.
Rich just got richer.

04:02.840 --> 04:03.932
That's us, right?
You heard that?

04:03.970 --> 04:05.961
I heard that.

04:06.010 --> 04:06.977
Well, unless, of course,
you guys have

04:07.010 --> 04:08.773
already made your choice,

04:08.810 --> 04:12.268
Adam will run down the new
Green Team graduates.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.810
ADAM: All right, we
graduated a class

04:13.850 --> 04:15.943
of real pipe-hitters
this time.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.413
One of 'em even
broke a couple

04:17.450 --> 04:18.587
of Jason's obstacle
course records.
Oh!

04:18.620 --> 04:21.282
Stop. I heard the track was
a lot faster this year, okay?

04:21.320 --> 04:22.685
We don't need to
hear that right now.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.357
Didn't break mine.
Oh, I don't think...

04:24.390 --> 04:26.494
I think I did.
I think not.

04:26.530 --> 04:28.896
Okay, okay, we'll
start with the cream.

04:28.930 --> 04:31.421
Three-way tie at the top
of the class-- Sarkisian,

04:31.470 --> 04:33.631
Spenser, McAdams.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.602
Do we take the fact that
you guys aren't saying

04:40.640 --> 04:42.676
you want Clay as an indication
you don't want Clay?

04:42.710 --> 04:45.042
Opinions differ.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.548
Not saying we don't want him,

04:47.580 --> 04:50.083
just saying I'm doing
my due diligence, that's all.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.884
You had him
with you for an op.
Yeah, I did.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.911
I mean, nothing in this file
is gonna tell us as much

04:54.960 --> 04:57.758
as getting a dude downrange,
see him up close.

04:57.790 --> 05:01.021
You have any issues
with him in Liberia?

05:01.060 --> 05:02.618
You read the AAR.
If we had an issue,

05:02.670 --> 05:03.864
we would have checked
those boxes.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.960
We don't. I am just here
to do my homework.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.036
Thank you very much.

05:09.070 --> 05:12.608
ADAM: All right, Clay Spenser,
second-generation frogman.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.104
Am I ever gonna understand
your problem with this kid?

05:16.140 --> 05:17.607
Did you not
just hear me say

05:17.650 --> 05:19.618
that I do not have
a problem with this kid?

05:19.650 --> 05:21.117
Uh, yeah, "I just need to do
a little more homework"?

05:21.150 --> 05:23.448
Yeah, I heard.
I do.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.583
You're seriously gonna let
Clay go to another squadron,

05:25.620 --> 05:27.611
or, worse yet, another team
within our squadron?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.787
You know Beau wants him.
I know Beau wants him.
You kidding me?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.821
What, you don't have a problem
with this Spenser kid?

05:31.860 --> 05:33.020
Why, 'cause he's
a little cocky?

05:33.060 --> 05:34.459
A little cocky?
I've seen cockier.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.024
JASON (laughs):
Yeah, okay.

05:36.060 --> 05:37.789
You know, he's the poster boy
for, you know what,

05:37.830 --> 05:40.492
I'm born on third, and he thinks
he's hit a triple, all right?

05:40.540 --> 05:42.405
You know, it's funny,
having Ash Spenser for a daddy

05:42.440 --> 05:43.566
doesn't seem like
a triple to me.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.635
What are you
talking about?

05:45.670 --> 05:47.376
He's Special Ops royalty.

05:47.410 --> 05:49.071
I stand corrected.

05:50.910 --> 05:53.447
It doesn't matter if you didn't
get any sleep last night.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.710
BROCK: Do you realize
I have a social life?
(laughter)

05:55.750 --> 05:56.944
All right?
Yeah.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.685
Scott Powell,
General Counsel

05:58.720 --> 06:00.551
to the Secretary
of Defense.

06:00.590 --> 06:01.852
Never a good sign when
there's a lawyer in the room.

06:01.890 --> 06:03.653
(clears throat)

06:05.130 --> 06:07.951
Lucas Garner.
DAVIS: The man, the myth.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.093
The traitor.

06:10.130 --> 06:11.791
MANDY:
In March of 2014,

06:11.830 --> 06:13.798
Army Private Lucas Garner
was captured

06:13.840 --> 06:15.899
by the Taliban
in Korengal Valley

06:15.940 --> 06:17.737
in Northeastern Afghanistan.

06:17.770 --> 06:20.500
Sorry, "captured."
Didn't he surrender?
Yeah, he abandoned his post,

06:20.540 --> 06:22.940
and then went looking for
someone to take him prisoner.

06:22.980 --> 06:25.175
There's still some uncertainty
surrounding Private Garner,

06:25.210 --> 06:26.575
how he _came to his
current Circumstance.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.042
I'm sure we'll be
able to clear

06:28.080 --> 06:29.889
a lot of this up
when we debrief him

06:29.920 --> 06:30.739
after you bring him home.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.678
Stop me if you've
heard this one before.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.711
Sorry, is there a problem?

06:34.760 --> 06:35.818
JASON:
No, it's no problem.

06:35.860 --> 06:38.055
It's just that, uh,
all of us have been on missions

06:38.090 --> 06:39.057
trying to find this guy,

06:39.090 --> 06:40.489
and we've come up empty-handed.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.519
Well, good news then.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.926
This time, you won't have
to try to find him.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.790
You made a deal?
We negotiated

06:45.830 --> 06:47.559
a prisoner exchange.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.205
ERIC: Bravo Team will be
transporting three Taliban

06:50.240 --> 06:52.902
detainees that the DoD
has agreed to give back.

06:52.940 --> 06:55.670
Gonna trade 'em for Garner,

06:55.710 --> 06:57.575
then safely transport
Garner back here.

06:57.610 --> 06:59.544
SONNY: You're telling me
we're releasing three bad guys

06:59.580 --> 07:01.673
in exchange for that ass-hat?

07:01.720 --> 07:02.641
All right, this
prisoner exchange,

07:02.690 --> 07:04.009
that's gonna happen where,

07:04.050 --> 07:05.210
on the edge of the Tribals?

07:05.250 --> 07:07.810
Uh, in the Tribals,
actually.

07:07.860 --> 07:08.815
In the Tribals?

07:08.860 --> 07:10.748
50 miles north of Peshawar.

07:10.790 --> 07:13.020
That's not just the Tribals,
that's the Pakistani Tribals.

07:13.060 --> 07:15.756
Well, Pakistani Intelligence,
they brokered the deal.

07:15.800 --> 07:16.767
I'm sorry, but are we
supposed to trust

07:16.800 --> 07:19.018
the Pakistani 151 now?

07:19.070 --> 07:21.630
Their spooks
are even shadier than ours.
JASON: Right.

07:21.670 --> 07:23.900
No offense.
Brass decided that 151

07:23.940 --> 07:26.704
were our best go-between
with the Taliban.

07:26.740 --> 07:29.208
ISI is the Taliban.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.674
I think that's overstating.
MANDY: Not by much.

07:31.710 --> 07:33.610
You remember last year,
a bunch of Rangers

07:33.650 --> 07:37.040
got torn up going after
a Taliban financier?

07:37.090 --> 07:39.957
There's some evidence
ISI walked them

07:39.990 --> 07:41.651
into an ambush.

07:41.690 --> 07:42.759
Oh, delightful.

07:42.790 --> 07:44.087
JASON: Okay, look, what
about the Pakistani army?

07:44.130 --> 07:46.792
ISI wants us to keep them
out of the loop.

07:46.830 --> 07:49.765
Says the army has too many
Taliban sleepers.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.791
DAVIS: So the Pakistani
Intelligence

07:51.830 --> 07:53.036
is accusing the Pakistani army
of having

07:53.070 --> 07:54.799
too many Taliban sleepers?

07:54.840 --> 07:56.637
RAY: Uh, to be fair,
the Taliban and the ISI

07:56.670 --> 07:57.967
aren't exactly sleeping.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.773
Y'all cut one hell of a deal.

07:59.810 --> 08:00.777
ERIC:
All right, look,

08:00.810 --> 08:03.074
apparently the brass want
this prisoner swap

08:03.110 --> 08:04.702
to happen bad enough
that they agreed

08:04.750 --> 08:06.672
to do whatever
they had to.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.210
Now, I know the setup sucks--

08:08.250 --> 08:09.683
puts you undermanned
in one of the most

08:09.720 --> 08:11.119
dangerous spots on Earth,

08:11.150 --> 08:13.914
forces us to trust
the Pakistani Intelligence

08:13.960 --> 08:16.053
is not gonna set you up.

08:16.090 --> 08:17.728
But that's out
of our hands right now.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.159
The bottom line is...

08:19.190 --> 08:20.953
is that the secretary
asked for us by name

08:21.000 --> 08:23.719
because he believed
that we can pull it off.

08:25.170 --> 08:27.832
Well, I guess we'll just have
to prove him right.

08:40.580 --> 08:42.912
As Lieutenant Commander
Blackburn mentioned,

08:42.950 --> 08:44.679
the Khyber Agency
is one of the most

08:44.720 --> 08:46.244
dangerous regions on Earth.

08:46.290 --> 08:50.056
Large networks
of Taliban and AQ.

08:51.930 --> 08:52.999
Well, there's that.

08:53.030 --> 08:55.225
I'm not saying they're
setting us up for an ambush,

08:55.260 --> 08:57.820
but if they were...
Yeah, they got the deck
stacked in their favor.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.019
Any idea how to unstack it?

08:59.070 --> 09:00.958
Well, they know about our night
vision, so there's no way

09:01.000 --> 09:02.968
they're gonna let us make
the trade in the dark.

09:03.010 --> 09:03.999
Uh, yeah, they insisted
on daylight.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.237
Excuse me for one moment.
Okay.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.838
JASON: Now what?
Yes, srr?

09:08.880 --> 09:09.904
We could leave
them three bad guys

09:09.950 --> 09:12.305
and Garner right where they are

09:12.350 --> 09:13.772
and let 'em all rot.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.982
Sayin' it's another way to go.

09:19.020 --> 09:20.817
MANDY:
Okay, these are the detainees

09:20.860 --> 09:23.055
you'll be escorting to Pakistan.

09:23.090 --> 09:26.253
Fayaz Saqib,
Senior Taliban Commander.

09:26.290 --> 09:27.757
Amir Haq, 52.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.665
Chief of Intelligence
for the Taliban

09:29.700 --> 09:32.260
until his capture in 2003.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.335
Omar Malik.

09:33.370 --> 09:35.258
Leader of a Taliban AQ cell.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.734
_ He's been held in
Isolation smce an attack

09:37.770 --> 09:38.862
on a Gitmo guard last year.

09:38.910 --> 09:41.674
Secretary Wallace
wants you all to know

09:41.710 --> 09:43.143
you have his full support,
and that your safety

09:43.180 --> 09:44.670
is one of our top priorities.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.371
Right.
DAVIS: The prisoners
are en route.

09:46.410 --> 09:49.311
As soon as they're loaded, we'll
be wheels-up for Jalalabad.

09:49.350 --> 09:51.147
What time are they supposed
to arrive?

09:51.190 --> 09:53.818
Earliest, 1830 this evening.
We've got time.

09:53.860 --> 09:56.283
Anyone want to check out that
new spicy chicken place off 64?

09:56.320 --> 09:58.788
I'm afraid we're not
allowed to leave the base.
I'm sorry.

09:58.830 --> 09:59.854
Excuse me, why is that?

09:59.900 --> 10:01.856
Command wants to keep
a tight lid on this thing.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.765
They remember what happened
with the Bergdahl swap.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.062
They lost control
of the story.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.692
Meaning they think
that the only way

10:06.740 --> 10:08.628
to keep us from leaking
is to keep us locked down?

10:08.670 --> 10:10.934
Yeah, which means he loses
quality time with his newborn.

10:10.970 --> 10:12.403
Yeah, I do.
Right. Because of what?

10:12.440 --> 10:14.931
Some _D.C. cake eaters _
are paranord about a lealq ship?

10:14.980 --> 10:15.878
I'm sorry, but let me
get this clear.

10:15.910 --> 10:18.708
You're saying we have to
stay here and wait

10:18.750 --> 10:22.072
until the Talis fly in
from Gitmo?

10:22.120 --> 10:24.645
Look, I'm just telling you
the situation, all right?

10:24.690 --> 10:26.248
Doesn't mean we have to like it.

10:26.290 --> 10:29.157
I don't like it.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.796
No rest for the wicked.

10:36.830 --> 10:38.161
Go.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.017
(soft chiming)

11:00.120 --> 11:03.886
You do realize I am technically
committing several felonies?

11:03.930 --> 11:05.818
Not to mention,
numerous violations

11:05.860 --> 11:07.327
of the Uniform Code
of Military Justice,

11:07.360 --> 11:09.897
any of which could result
in my dishonorable discharge.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.090
We do.
We do.

11:11.130 --> 11:12.324
And you two are both AWOL,

11:12.370 --> 11:14.691
meaning, technically, you are
deserting in a time of war,

11:14.740 --> 11:15.661
which is punishable by death.

11:15.700 --> 11:18.931
Yeah, on the other hand,
though, that chicken.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.073
Spicy chicken.

11:22.110 --> 11:24.874
Oh, my God.
(soft chiming)

11:26.950 --> 11:29.714
Hardwood floors throughout.

11:29.750 --> 11:34.050
Storage closet could be
converted to a baby's room.

11:34.090 --> 11:34.909
Uh, actually, we're not...

11:34.960 --> 11:36.928
Really trying yet.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.793
Yeah. My husband's
just such a Peter Pan.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.127
(Realtor chuckles)

11:41.160 --> 11:43.720
Yes, well, never hurts
to think about the future.

11:43.770 --> 11:44.828
Right.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.134
I always say any good Realtor
is part fortune-teller.

11:47.170 --> 11:48.239
Mm.

11:48.270 --> 11:49.999
Speaking of which,
piece of advice

11:50.040 --> 11:51.905
I give all my SEAL clients,

11:51.940 --> 11:54.079
more important that
the wife loves the place

11:54.110 --> 11:57.477
since she's the one that will be
alone In It 300 nights a year.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.978
Ah, you know, I doubt I'll be
gone that much. I mean...

12:00.020 --> 12:01.169
It's actually a really
good point, Chet,

12:01.220 --> 12:03.085
because Clay is really
married to his work.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.917
_ Hmm._
I'm just a mistress.

12:04.950 --> 12:06.247
Oh.
Yeah. No.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.986
(laughs)

12:13.500 --> 12:16.025
Wow, this chicken...

12:16.060 --> 12:18.028
clear your sinuses.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.368
I packed you guys
some go-to-hell bags,

12:20.400 --> 12:23.858
extra mags, extra frags, just
in case this swap goes sideways.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.901
Isn't it already gone sideways?

12:25.940 --> 12:28.773
You saying you actually think
the Talis are setting us up?

12:28.810 --> 12:30.243
And you don't?

12:30.280 --> 12:32.544
If the Taliban want
to ambush Americans,

12:32.580 --> 12:33.979
they don't have to go
through all this trouble.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.112
SONNY: They do if they
want to be certain

12:35.150 --> 12:38.381
that the guys they're ambushing
are Dev-Group operators.

12:38.420 --> 12:41.878
From the very same unit
that martyred Sheik Osama.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.024
And Abu Samir.

12:44.060 --> 12:47.996
Now, the upside of an ambush
is that Garner and the Talis,

12:48.030 --> 12:51.921
well, they get killed
in the cross fire.

12:51.970 --> 12:53.835
(cell phone chimes)

12:56.370 --> 12:58.406
The prisoners
just touched down.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.034
MPs are gonna transfer
them over to our plane.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.255
Here we go.

13:28.940 --> 13:30.430
All right, let's
get them situated.

13:30.470 --> 13:32.062
Set them down over there.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.144
(grunts)

13:46.190 --> 13:48.317
Excuse me.

14:11.180 --> 14:14.240
JASON:
These outfits are
a bit much, don't you think?

14:14.280 --> 14:16.009
RAY:
I think so.

14:16.050 --> 14:17.017
Hey, Davis.

14:17.050 --> 14:19.484
Any of these guys biters?
This guy's a spitter.

14:19.520 --> 14:22.284
We got one spitter here, huh?
Mm-hmm.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.629
Right. Any of them
speak English?

14:24.660 --> 14:26.457
Amir had CIA contact
in the '805,

14:26.490 --> 14:28.253
back when Mujahideen
were on our side,

14:28.300 --> 14:29.597
so probably picked up some.

14:32.470 --> 14:34.438
EngHsh?

14:34.470 --> 14:36.131
English.

14:38.470 --> 14:42.338
There's a lot of ways to make
this flight more unpleasant.

14:42.380 --> 14:45.178
Only my third time
on an airplane.

14:45.210 --> 14:48.941
I have no desire to find out
how much worse it could feel.

14:48.980 --> 14:50.447
Wait till we get
into the helicopters.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.139
They're like flying coffins.

14:52.190 --> 14:54.010
Hmm.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.311
Jason.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.021
Amir.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.129
Amir.

14:58.160 --> 15:01.926
We want to make this as easy
as possible for everyone,

15:01.960 --> 15:05.396
which means you respect us,
we'll respect you.

15:05.430 --> 15:06.692
I don't understand.

15:06.730 --> 15:08.664
Can you control this man?

15:08.700 --> 15:12.466
Malik is a violent man
and he hates Americans,

15:12.510 --> 15:15.308
but, yes, I believe
I can control him.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.182
(speaks Pashto)

15:25.220 --> 15:26.448
Malik.

15:26.490 --> 15:27.980
(speaks Pashto)

15:29.290 --> 15:31.178
I got to talk to you.

15:32.230 --> 15:33.527
Good?

15:33.560 --> 15:35.721
Yeah, I'm good.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.990
What is it?
I got to talk to you
about Sonny.

15:38.030 --> 15:39.622
What about Sonny? What,
did he oil up my helmet again?

15:39.670 --> 15:40.830
No. You know when Sonny
was at Team 4,

15:40.870 --> 15:43.509
he had that friend that got
blown up next to him on target?

15:43.540 --> 15:45.167
The guy ended up
getting medically retired?

15:45.210 --> 15:47.303
Yeah, Danny something.
Danny Cooper.

15:47.340 --> 15:48.602
Yeah, yeah, he was supposed
to start Green Team

15:48.640 --> 15:50.972
with Sonny, but the op
that Danny got hurt on,

15:51.010 --> 15:52.500
they were searching
for Lucas Garner

15:52.550 --> 15:54.472
right after he'd
abandoned his post.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.976
Right. And so
you're saying

15:56.020 --> 15:58.614
that Garner cost
Danny his dream job.

15:58.650 --> 16:00.982
I just thought
you should know.

16:01.020 --> 16:02.351
Yeah. Mm.

16:02.390 --> 16:03.322
Sonny'll keep it together.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.520
He'll be focused, you know.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.050
He'll keep his
priorities straight

16:06.090 --> 16:07.523
or he's gonna lose
his dream job.

16:14.470 --> 16:16.131
Just watch-watch the back
of it. Watch the back.

16:16.170 --> 16:17.307
Oh, thank you.

16:17.340 --> 16:18.659
(laughs)

16:18.710 --> 16:20.200
How did I get roped into this?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.572
Okay, good.
We have to...

16:22.610 --> 16:24.043
Wait, wait. No,
dont,dont,dont,

16:25.480 --> 16:27.118
You know a big, tough
frogman can't get

16:27.150 --> 16:28.412
the couch through
the doorway,

16:28.450 --> 16:30.145
war on terror's making
more and more sense now.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.384
Oh, you know,
the general is only as good

16:31.420 --> 16:33.308
as the army who's fighting
for him.
(laughs)

16:33.360 --> 16:35.510
Or her.
Okay, you
know what, um,

16:35.560 --> 16:37.448
we're gonna, uh, drop the couch,
and we're gonna pivot it

16:37.490 --> 16:38.320
and then we're gonna push it in.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.622
I've moved a thousand couches,
okay?

16:39.660 --> 16:40.627
That's not gonna work.

16:40.660 --> 16:42.525
You know what, I am sweating,

16:42.560 --> 16:43.561
probably ruining
the super cute top

16:43.600 --> 16:44.692
that you haven't
even commented on

16:44.730 --> 16:46.425
and I'm hating myself for even
being the kind of person

16:46.470 --> 16:47.437
who wears a super cute top

16:47.470 --> 16:48.789
to impress you,
not to mention

16:48.840 --> 16:50.762
I have a giant stack of
papers that needs grading.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.232
So you might want
to pump the brakes

16:52.270 --> 16:54.135
on the whole mansplaining
couch moving to me.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.273
All right, so, we're gonna,
we're gonna drop it,

16:56.310 --> 16:57.299
and swivel and push it.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.170
Yes.

16:59.210 --> 17:01.474
Ooh.
All right.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.078
There we go, there we go.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.247
Ah.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.815
All right, I think
I've earned a break.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.680
I'm sorry for...

17:09.720 --> 17:12.223
What? Failing to
heed the wisdom

17:12.260 --> 17:13.818
of your more tactically
adept girlfriend?

17:13.860 --> 17:15.828
(chuckles)

17:15.860 --> 17:17.418
That is a super cute top.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.495
Oh, well, thank you.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.437
So, uh,

17:25.470 --> 17:27.404
you must be Clay.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.579
Chet always gives us a heads-up
when a teammate's moving in.

17:29.610 --> 17:32.647
Oh.
You're the, uh,
Alpha 2 IC, right?

17:32.680 --> 17:34.671
Yeah. Derek.
Derek. How's it going?

17:34.720 --> 17:36.119
This is_Trish.
Hi.

17:36.150 --> 17:37.549
Nice to meet you.
This is Stella.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.648
(laughing):
Hi. Nice to meet you.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.282
You, too.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.550
Nice to meet you.

17:42.590 --> 17:44.478
DEREK:
So, uh,

17:44.530 --> 17:46.122
can I give you guys a hand?

17:46.160 --> 17:48.526
Yeah. Yeah, man, that'd be,
that'd be great.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.164
Not that Stella's
not capable, but...

17:51.370 --> 17:53.691
These boys need to feel a
sense of accomplishment, right?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.230
(chuckles)

17:55.270 --> 17:57.465
Let's bring this right over here
to this corner here.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.329
Great.
(grunts)

17:58.370 --> 18:01.203
TRISH: Derek's team
was hit with an RPG

18:01.240 --> 18:03.777
in Diyala Province,
October 14, 2010.

18:03.810 --> 18:05.368
Excuse me?

18:05.410 --> 18:06.672
His arm.

18:06.710 --> 18:09.645
Right. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to stare.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.284
Are you kidding?

18:11.320 --> 18:12.685
I stared so much
that first year,

18:12.720 --> 18:14.358
I forgot the color
of his eyes.

18:14.390 --> 18:17.359
Whoa. I can't imagine.

18:17.390 --> 18:19.483
The first year or two
are the only really bad ones.

18:19.530 --> 18:22.658
After that, you've had time
to learn the new routines.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.760
Right, well, he seems to
be doing really well now.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.633
Getting back with the team
got his mind right.

18:28.670 --> 18:31.138
You know the hardest part?

18:31.170 --> 18:33.536
Even worse than seeing him
in pain after each surgery

18:33.580 --> 18:35.332
was watching him
climb the walls,

18:35.380 --> 18:37.348
itching to get back
in the fight.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.745
Thought it would've been
a dream come true

18:38.780 --> 18:41.169
to have him stuck at home
with me for a while.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.711
Instead he was like a dog
chewing up the furniture.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.411
(chuckles)

18:45.450 --> 18:47.759
Are they drinking without us?

18:48.920 --> 18:50.387
Uh, yes. Yes, they are.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.522
Yes. Please, go ahead.

18:51.560 --> 18:52.720
There's-there's gonna be more.
Yeah.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.751
There's more.

19:05.640 --> 19:06.937
SONNY:
So, uh,

19:06.970 --> 19:08.631
what's up with the draft, man?

19:08.680 --> 19:11.205
We gonna take Spenser's kid?

19:11.250 --> 19:12.774
Still unclear.

19:12.810 --> 19:14.346
(laughing):
Oh, man.

19:14.380 --> 19:15.847
You telling me right now
that there's another guy

19:15.880 --> 19:17.643
that graduated from Green Team
that's better than him?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.578
No, I didn't say all that.

19:19.620 --> 19:21.588
SONNY: Bet them boys are
anxious as hell right now.

19:21.620 --> 19:24.180
I remember how worried I was,

19:24.230 --> 19:25.879
wondering what team
I was gonna get drafted to

19:25.930 --> 19:28.649
that I checked myself
into a motel

19:28.700 --> 19:30.429
with two cases of Old Milwaukee.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.563
Calm you down?

19:32.600 --> 19:34.261
Not really.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.439
I got so drunk I peed myself.

19:36.470 --> 19:38.335
(Sonny and Ray laugh)

19:40.380 --> 19:44.339
What you think of, uh,
Clay Spenser, anyway?

19:44.380 --> 19:47.975
I think Clay Spenser's
a trueborn gunﬁghter.

19:48.020 --> 19:48.975
Only problem is

19:49.020 --> 19:51.841
he gives our boss the red ass.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.414
Fact is, however good
the kid can be,

19:53.460 --> 19:55.781
if he and Jason are butting
heads on everything,

19:55.820 --> 19:58.220
it'll get in the way
of our ability to operate.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.922
Yeah.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.520
Guess you don't need him,
anyway.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.605
Kabul has changed
from when I left.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.699
Almost didn't recognize it.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.719
Gentrification will do that
to a place.

20:20.750 --> 20:24.015
Yeah, once that first Starbucks
moves in, forget it.

20:24.050 --> 20:27.611
AMIR: This place, though,
it looks just as it did

20:27.660 --> 20:28.581
when I was last here,

20:28.620 --> 20:32.386
fighting the Russians,
no hair on my balls.

20:32.430 --> 20:34.523
Now I'm a grandfather.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.926
Four of my children had children

20:36.960 --> 20:40.259
while I was locked away
in your prison.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.665
When I was captured,

20:41.700 --> 20:44.737
my daughters were barely
as tall as my waist.

20:44.770 --> 20:46.761
That's your plan
when you're free?

20:46.810 --> 20:48.835
A little quality time
with the grandkids?

20:48.880 --> 20:52.771
You want to know if I intend
to return to war?

20:52.810 --> 20:53.845
I want to know
if this time next week

20:53.880 --> 20:54.517
you're gonna be shooting at us.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.688
Nights in prison, I would dream

20:58.720 --> 21:02.508
about taking my grandchildren
to my fig tree

21:02.560 --> 21:04.528
in the evening, after supper.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.427
We will eat figs,

21:07.460 --> 21:09.826
watch the stars, get fat.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.858
But I am a warrior

21:12.900 --> 21:14.492
and you are my enemy.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.839
If I see you next week,
I will kill you.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.800
Well, that's not too friendly.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.899
But at least it's simple.

21:23.950 --> 21:27.317
You have treated me with honor.

21:27.350 --> 21:29.272
It would be shameful
to lie to you.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.488
MAN:
Clear! They're ready to go!

21:34.520 --> 21:36.283
(shouts indistinctly)

21:44.670 --> 21:47.093
They're passing into Pakistan.

21:47.130 --> 21:49.030
They're making good time.

21:51.910 --> 21:54.879
You don't like having
those guys around, do you?

21:54.910 --> 21:56.571
Prisoners?

21:58.810 --> 22:00.846
Brings back bad memories.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.812
Yeah.

22:01.850 --> 22:05.741
I heard the Taliban
detainees can be... rough.

22:05.790 --> 22:08.782
Especially to female
interrogators.

22:08.820 --> 22:10.629
It wasn't good.

22:10.660 --> 22:13.128
What they tried to do to us,
what we did to them...

22:13.160 --> 22:14.821
Was it enhanced interrogation?

22:14.860 --> 22:17.920
You ever see
any of that?

22:17.970 --> 22:19.961
Luclq you.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.377
Bandit, we keep losing visual
behind those clouds.

22:30.410 --> 22:31.809
Is there a reason you're not
switching 'em to radar?

22:33.080 --> 22:35.913
Our Predator pilot's having
issues with the radar.

22:35.950 --> 22:38.589
Can't the Predator fly
below the clouds?

22:38.620 --> 22:39.917
It'd be visible
from the ground,

22:39.950 --> 22:41.451
give away the position
of our unit.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.958
We could have our team
sit tight.

22:43.990 --> 22:45.855
Wait till the coverage clears.

22:45.890 --> 22:47.152
There's no time.
If our guys are late

22:47.190 --> 22:48.828
for the swap
or deviate

22:48.860 --> 22:50.566
from the_terms we
agreed to in any way,

22:50.600 --> 22:52.124
the Talis are liable
to back out of the deal.

22:52.170 --> 22:54.138
And we're blind.

22:54.170 --> 22:56.968
All call signs, this is TOC.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.867
Be advised we've temporarily
lost overwatch.

22:59.910 --> 23:01.901
Repeat, we have lost overwatch.

23:03.510 --> 23:04.841
SONNY: SecDef would
like to remind us

23:04.880 --> 23:08.714
that our safety is their
number one priority.

23:10.550 --> 23:11.517
SONNY:
Whoa.

23:11.550 --> 23:13.518
Uh-oh.
Pakistani army.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.915
That's not good.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.520
What's the move, bossman?

23:18.560 --> 23:20.596
Cut 'em loose.

23:22.660 --> 23:24.196
You sure?

23:24.230 --> 23:26.698
JASON:
These soldie_rs find out
we're transporting prisoners,

23:26.730 --> 23:27.833
they're gonna have
a whole lot of questions

23:27.870 --> 23:29.189
we don't want to answer.

23:29.240 --> 23:30.730
Copy that.

23:30.770 --> 23:31.839
Cut 'em loose.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.872
You expecting these guys
are gonna cooperate?

23:39.910 --> 23:40.877
RAY:
Why not?

23:40.920 --> 23:43.070
They know we're letting them go.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.883
These guys are a toss-up
for all of us.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.740
You think they understand you?

23:46.790 --> 23:48.815
I sure hope so.

23:48.860 --> 23:51.579
(shouting in Pashto)

23:51.630 --> 23:53.188
Everybody out!

23:56.900 --> 23:58.697
Here we go.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.168
What are you doing on this road?

24:04.210 --> 24:05.529
JASON: We're on
a diplomatic mission,

24:05.570 --> 24:06.969
transporting
these tribal leaders

24:07.010 --> 24:09.535
to the consulate in Peshawar.

24:09.580 --> 24:10.501
SOLDIER:
Tribal leaders?

24:10.550 --> 24:11.801
Yeah.

24:11.850 --> 24:12.976
I know all the tribal leaders
in Khyber.

24:13.010 --> 24:14.170
They're not from Khyber.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.812
They're from South Waziristan.

24:15.850 --> 24:17.841
Ah, that explains it.

24:19.050 --> 24:22.053
You think I can't recognize
Taliban when I see them?

24:22.090 --> 24:23.955
I've spent years
slaughtering these pigs.

24:23.990 --> 24:24.888
Dawusa.

24:24.930 --> 24:25.828
(shouts in Pashto)

24:25.860 --> 24:26.986
(Amir shouts in Pashto)

24:27.030 --> 24:28.054
(Amir grunts)

24:28.100 --> 24:29.158
Okay, TOC, look,

24:29.200 --> 24:31.020
this is Bravo 1,
I'm in the blind.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.095
I need the name of the general
in this sector.

24:33.130 --> 24:34.666
That'd be General Khan.

24:35.870 --> 24:38.930
Rumor _has it he sometimes
has entire platoons whipped

24:38.970 --> 24:41.575
for exhibiting
insufficient motivation.

24:42.780 --> 24:44.077
Hey, you know what?
This is just stupid.

24:44.110 --> 24:45.202
I'll tell you what,
I'll just get in touch

24:45.250 --> 24:46.672
with General Khan.
General Khan?

24:46.710 --> 24:48.268
Yeah, General Khan,
and he can confirm my mission.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.116
Could I have the sat phone?

24:52.120 --> 24:54.179
You're sure we're not
disturbing him,

24:54.220 --> 24:55.255
General Khan?

24:55.290 --> 24:56.917
Well, afternoon,

24:56.960 --> 24:57.927
he's probably with his mistress.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.120
Absolutely.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.219
I'm sure he wouldn't
mind stepping away

25:01.260 --> 25:02.955
for something this important.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.598
Let's not disturb the general.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.099
Okay.

25:15.140 --> 25:16.676
We have an understanding?

25:16.710 --> 25:18.701
Okay. Good.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.282
(Amir gasping)

25:33.130 --> 25:34.757
How'd you know
that was gonna play?

25:34.800 --> 25:37.189
One thing common to every
army on Earth, right?

25:37.230 --> 25:39.960
(gasping)

25:41.000 --> 25:42.262
(grunts)

25:42.300 --> 25:44.734
Hey, Amir.

25:44.770 --> 25:46.806
Back up. Just back up.
Give me some room.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.808
We need the medvac, now.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.645
JASON:
Sternal IO.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.784
Should I sterilize my hands?
Come on.

25:58.820 --> 26:00.287
Trent, Brock,
load these guys up.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.151
JASON:
Let's go.

26:02.190 --> 26:03.680
Hey.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.924
What's wrong with him?
Could be anything.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.154
Internal bleed.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.021
Some fluid should
bring him back.

26:08.060 --> 26:09.755
Come on, FAST1. FAST1.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.222
Give me the patch,
all right?

26:11.270 --> 26:12.862
We lose this guy, the
whole deal can go boom.

26:12.900 --> 26:13.867
SONNY: Maybe that
wouldn't be so terrible.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.697
Bad guys
go back to Gitmo

26:15.740 --> 26:17.765
and Garner rots there
with the Talis.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.038
Win-win.
FAST1.

26:19.070 --> 26:20.298
Stop screwing around.

26:21.340 --> 26:24.070
Government spends
millions of dollars

26:24.110 --> 26:26.146
training us
to kill these guys

26:26.180 --> 26:28.011
and here we are,
trying to save one.

26:31.350 --> 26:32.749
JASON:
Hold that up.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.909
It working?

26:36.960 --> 26:38.382
I sure hope so.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.250
Come on, old man,
wake up.

26:40.290 --> 26:42.258
Let's go.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.120
Come on, wake up.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.296
Let's go.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.025
Wake up. Huh?

26:47.070 --> 26:48.196
All right,
he's up.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.730
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

26:49.770 --> 26:52.238
We had a medical problem
with one of our passengers.

26:52.270 --> 26:54.204
He's stabilized now.
We're gonna get back on road.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.105
Tell the Talis to hold tight.

26:56.140 --> 26:58.005
It's too late,
they're already moving.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.199
They spooked
when you missed the window.

26:59.250 --> 27:00.649
Claim they no longer feel safe

27:00.680 --> 27:03.012
making the swap
in the agreed upon place.

27:03.050 --> 27:04.415
JASON:
They don't feel safe?

27:04.450 --> 27:06.281
So that's it?
What, the mission's scrubbed?

27:06.320 --> 27:09.209
They say
they'll still do the trade,

27:09.260 --> 27:10.887
so long as you meet them
in a mountain valley

27:10.930 --> 27:13.182
about five klicks east
of the original site.

27:13.230 --> 27:16.199
DAVIS: It's even deeper
into the Khyber Agency.

27:16.230 --> 27:17.697
We don't know the terrain,

27:17.730 --> 27:19.061
we don't know how many enemy
lie in wait.

27:19.100 --> 27:20.829
Plus, it's in a valley
surrounded by mountains--

27:20.870 --> 27:21.962
the comms are gonna
be even worse.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.137
MANDY:
I agree.

27:23.170 --> 27:24.967
It puts you guys
at much greater risk.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.659
Hard for me to see
a safe way to do it.

27:26.710 --> 27:30.339
They're paid to kick down doors,
not ask questions, right?

27:38.350 --> 27:40.181
Be awful trusting of us
to drive in there.

27:40.220 --> 27:42.085
Mountains on
four Sides.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.883
There's no real cover.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.022
All right, tell you what,

27:45.060 --> 27:47.381
I say we split up our forces,
put an overwatch here.

27:47.430 --> 27:50.297
Replace what we lose
not having the Predator.
Yeah.

27:50.330 --> 27:52.025
Okay, we good?
We leave in five minutes.

27:52.070 --> 27:53.025
Let's saddle up.
Copy that.

27:53.070 --> 27:54.867
Let's go.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.436
Hey, come on over here, Sonny,
I need to talk to you

27:56.470 --> 27:59.030
before we got Lucas Garner
standing in front of us.

27:59.070 --> 28:00.162
Know that whole
Danny Cooper op,

28:00.210 --> 28:02.474
you know, where he got
blown up, almost lost his leg?

28:02.510 --> 28:05.104
You guys were
going after Garner.

28:05.150 --> 28:06.105
Davis got a big mouth.
Hey.

28:06.150 --> 28:07.777
Listen to me.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.048
Keep it professional.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.843
Get your priorities straight.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.142
What happened to Danny,
that shouldn't have happened.

28:13.190 --> 28:15.351
But it did happen,

28:15.390 --> 28:17.381
and there's nothing we
could've done about it.

28:17.420 --> 28:20.480
But what we can do
is our job. Right?

28:20.530 --> 28:22.498
So we go in there, we get
Garner and we bring him home.

28:22.530 --> 28:24.088
We'll let those
cake eaters decide

28:24.130 --> 28:25.267
whether or not
he's worth it.

28:25.300 --> 28:26.995
You understand?

28:29.140 --> 28:30.289
Roger that.

28:30.340 --> 28:32.331
Do your job.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.341
*

29:09.410 --> 29:11.401
*

29:36.970 --> 29:38.130
Still nothing?

29:40.410 --> 29:42.401
_ RAY:
Nothing we can see.

29:50.050 --> 29:52.985
What do you think?

29:53.020 --> 29:55.159
I think they're here somewhere,
watching.

29:57.060 --> 29:58.482
JASON:
I agree.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.486
Just wish we knew where.

30:11.440 --> 30:14.477
You saved my life.

30:14.510 --> 30:16.398
No need to thank me.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.976
I'm not thanking you.

30:18.010 --> 30:19.500
Just trying
to understand.

30:21.380 --> 30:22.608
What's there to understand?

30:22.650 --> 30:24.117
You die, our mission fails.

30:24.150 --> 30:26.516
Then your mission
is wrong.

30:26.550 --> 30:29.348
I am your enemy, your mission
should be to kill me.

30:29.390 --> 30:32.427
Well, one thing
at a time, huh?

30:37.900 --> 30:39.868
RAY:
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 2.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.538
Go for 1.

30:41.570 --> 30:43.492
You got three vehicles
approaching from the southwest.

30:47.940 --> 30:49.305
Yep, we got 'em.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.843
Here we go.

31:03.660 --> 31:05.855
(Taliban soldiers talking
indistinctly)

31:10.430 --> 31:12.261
Count 15 males, all armed.

31:12.300 --> 31:14.291
(Taliban soldiers shouting)

31:25.580 --> 31:28.140
We got eyes on target.

31:28.180 --> 31:31.013
Physical visual ID.
of Lucas Garner.

31:31.050 --> 31:32.142
. . RAY: ..
Confirming p05itive I.D.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.249
of the American prisoner.

31:37.490 --> 31:42.098
Maybe they decided
to honor the deal after all.

31:50.100 --> 31:51.704
RAY:
Bravo 1, we got company.

31:51.740 --> 31:54.277
Multiple armed males
on the ridge,

31:54.310 --> 31:55.902
directly east
of your position.

32:00.650 --> 32:03.471
Copy. We see 'em.

32:06.050 --> 32:09.451
I told you we shouldn't
trust these guys.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.967
Release the brothers!

32:23.000 --> 32:25.139
Then, we will send yours!

32:37.020 --> 32:39.147
I tell you what, Ray.

32:40.190 --> 32:43.318
This goes sideways,

32:43.360 --> 32:44.657
there is one person
in this valley

32:44.690 --> 32:46.419
that ain't coming out alive.

32:46.460 --> 32:49.657
Least no_ one else would have to
die trying to save this traitor.

32:49.700 --> 32:52.396
I'm gonna do all of us a favor
and assume that was a joke.

32:52.430 --> 32:53.328
Because...?

32:53.370 --> 32:54.997
Because you just
informed me

32:55.040 --> 32:57.235
you plan to murder
an unarmed fellow serviceman.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.507
It was a joke, then.

33:00.540 --> 33:01.575
Ha, ha.

33:05.780 --> 33:07.577
Okay, look.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.441
If this thing
falls apart,

33:09.480 --> 33:11.448
it'll be you guys
between the guns.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.344
I hope you
and your buddies know that,

33:13.390 --> 33:15.017
before you do
anything stupid.

33:16.360 --> 33:17.509
Let's go.

33:36.310 --> 33:38.505
That's halfway.

33:43.550 --> 33:47.646
Boss, aren't they supposed to be
letting Garner start his walk?

33:47.690 --> 33:50.557
Damn it.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.593
RAY: Bravo 1, we got
five more enemy approaching

33:58.630 --> 33:59.562
from the southeast ridge,

33:59.600 --> 34:01.397
250 meters from your position.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.465
Copy that. We see 'em.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.401
How many does that make?

34:06.440 --> 34:08.533
Thirty-two.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.775
32 against five?

34:10.810 --> 34:12.277
If we've seen them all.

34:12.310 --> 34:13.777
Which I doubt.

34:13.810 --> 34:17.314
Like I said, never should've
trusted these guys.

34:17.350 --> 34:19.079
(Taliban soldiers
speaking indistinctly)

34:24.760 --> 34:26.455
SONNY:
Boss.

34:26.490 --> 34:28.629
Let Ray and I open up,

34:28.660 --> 34:30.491
and we can get
ten or 12 of these guys

34:30.530 --> 34:32.498
before they start taking cover.

34:32.530 --> 34:34.430
Don't engage.
Repeat: do not engage.

34:34.470 --> 34:35.562
RAY:
He's got a point, J.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.568
If this thing jumps off, we need
to seize the initiative

34:37.600 --> 34:39.431
and start cutting
into their numbers.

34:39.470 --> 34:40.732
JASON:
Both of you, hold.

34:40.770 --> 34:42.328
I didn't come
halfway across the world

34:42.380 --> 34:43.472
not to bring him back home.

34:43.510 --> 34:46.604
(speaking indistinctly)

34:46.650 --> 34:48.641
(quietly):
Come on.

34:50.580 --> 34:53.140
(speaking indistinctly)

34:53.190 --> 34:55.078
(speaks Pashto)

35:00.190 --> 35:01.691
Let's move.

35:26.850 --> 35:29.216
He's clean, boss.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.291
We're here to bring you home.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.540
We got him.

35:52.580 --> 35:54.639
Exfil, exfil, exfil, exfil.

35:57.250 --> 35:59.810
RAY:
Roger that. Moving to exfil.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.224
Meet you
at the rally point.

36:14.770 --> 36:16.465
That was hairy, huh?

36:16.500 --> 36:17.831
Oh, yeah.

36:17.870 --> 36:19.201
How was Sonny?

36:19.240 --> 36:20.537
Was he able to keep his cool?

36:20.570 --> 36:22.470
Ah... Sonny's
the Iceman. You know.

36:22.510 --> 36:24.705
Mm-hmm.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.377
How'd you know
you could trust Amir?

36:26.410 --> 36:27.547
Difference between
knowing and hoping.

36:27.580 --> 36:30.708
I think the guy
just wanted to go home.

36:30.750 --> 36:32.718
Oh, no, that's the thing.
He was home.

36:32.750 --> 36:34.354
And yet,
he still spoke up for us.

36:34.390 --> 36:35.516
He spoke up for you.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.754
Well, we understand
each other.

36:36.790 --> 36:38.348
I'm telling you,
if I had to choose

36:38.390 --> 36:39.823
between a guy I understand
and a guy I like,

36:39.860 --> 36:43.626
definitely going
with the guy I understand.

36:43.660 --> 36:44.888
Okay, so you're
saying the reason

36:44.930 --> 36:46.659
you don't want to put
Clay on this team

36:46.700 --> 36:48.736
is because you don't
think you understand him?

36:48.770 --> 36:49.862
No, I think I do.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.538
You lost me.

36:51.570 --> 36:53.868
Okay, listen, man. The whole
thing with the Spenser kid,

36:53.910 --> 36:56.708
he's a true believer,
you understand?

36:56.740 --> 36:59.538
He does not know
his own limitations.

36:59.580 --> 37:01.002
True believers,
they get people killed.

37:01.050 --> 37:02.870
They get themselves killed.

37:03.980 --> 37:05.641
So we'll keep him reined in.

37:05.690 --> 37:08.250
We'll keep an extra
eye on him.

37:08.290 --> 37:10.656
You-you're seriously gonna
pass up on that kind of talent?

37:10.690 --> 37:11.884
(sniffs)

37:14.830 --> 37:17.298
Hmm.

37:29.710 --> 37:31.439
How's he doing?

37:31.480 --> 37:34.415
He's dehydrated,
but he'll be fine.

37:40.890 --> 37:42.812
(bottles clank)

37:44.890 --> 37:48.826
Been a long time
since I saw a friendly face.

37:49.860 --> 37:52.021
I guess your bar
for friendliness

37:52.070 --> 37:54.868
is pretty damn low right now.

37:55.900 --> 38:00.030
Been a hostage for 1,355 days.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.573
This point, a friend is anybody

38:02.610 --> 38:04.771
that's not threatening
to cut my head off.

38:09.650 --> 38:12.778
Thank you.

38:12.820 --> 38:14.811
For coming for me.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.422
It's my job.

38:27.670 --> 38:29.490
Cheers, man.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.908
(laughter)

38:35.940 --> 38:37.077
Cheers.

38:57.830 --> 38:59.866
What...?

38:59.900 --> 39:02.095
It's just
a key, relax.

39:02.140 --> 39:05.598
You gave me
a freaking heart attack.

39:05.640 --> 39:08.768
Come on. I just figured,
this way, you know, you can...

39:08.810 --> 39:10.869
you can come and go,
and, you know,

39:10.910 --> 39:13.049
use the place as, like,
a writer's retreat.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.844
Right. A way to turn
a romantic gesture

39:15.880 --> 39:17.871
into an act of pragmatism.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.387
(laughs softly)

39:19.420 --> 39:21.957
I didn't mean it that way.

39:25.930 --> 39:27.921
Thank you.

39:31.770 --> 39:34.864
I want you to know that, um...

39:34.900 --> 39:37.835
I realize this isn't
what you Signed on for.

39:37.870 --> 39:40.532
This is exactly
what I signed on for.

39:40.570 --> 39:43.937
You know what I mean.

39:43.980 --> 39:46.949
The life of a Tier One operator.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.041
I'm here for you,

39:51.080 --> 39:53.082
not your job.

39:53.120 --> 39:57.011
Hmm. Not sure that's much
of a distinction.

39:58.890 --> 40:00.528
All right.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.949
Well, I'll be sure enough
for both of us.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.468
Okay?

40:05.500 --> 40:07.889
Come here.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.862
Mm...

40:10.900 --> 40:12.902
(sighs)

40:42.000 --> 40:44.503
(phone line ringing)

40:44.540 --> 40:45.700
(beeps)

40:51.610 --> 40:54.875
(phone line ringing)

40:54.920 --> 40:56.012
DANNY (over phone):
Hey, it's Danny.

40:56.050 --> 40:57.540
Try me on text.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.808
(beeps)

40:58.850 --> 41:01.011
Hey, Danny.

41:01.050 --> 41:01.982
How you doing, man?

41:02.020 --> 41:05.148
It's, uh, it's Sonny Quinn.

41:05.190 --> 41:07.852
Uh, you-- you just
been on my mind lately,

41:07.890 --> 41:11.155
and Ijust...

41:11.200 --> 41:13.998
just wanted to see
how you're doing.

41:14.030 --> 41:17.591
Uh, just get back to me
when you can.

41:32.020 --> 41:34.011
(inhales, exhales)

41:41.290 --> 41:43.190
8:00 am, tomorrow.

41:43.230 --> 41:45.596
Your team?
Yes. My team.

41:45.630 --> 41:47.769
And bring beer. Good beer.

41:47.800 --> 41:50.064
Cold beer. Not that
microbrew crap

41:52.110 --> 41:53.930
that you kids are drinking
these days. You got it?

41:53.970 --> 41:55.972
You got it, boss.

41:59.010 --> 42:00.671
JASON:
Better be cold.
