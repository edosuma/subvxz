WEBVTT

00:03.794 --> 00:05.093
<i>Bones,</i>

00:05.129 --> 00:06.495
you sure you don't
want to run over

00:06.530 --> 00:07.696
your testimony
for the morning?

00:07.731 --> 00:09.364
No need. I'm fully prepared.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.565
Just so you know,

00:10.601 --> 00:11.841
I'm hearing talk of suspension,

00:11.869 --> 00:13.435
possible anger
management classes.

00:13.470 --> 00:16.370
Both a waste of my time
and the FBI's resources.

00:16.407 --> 00:17.639
Bones, you know what?

00:17.674 --> 00:18.940
You punched a suspect.

00:18.976 --> 00:19.976
After that misogynist...

00:20.010 --> 00:21.309
Meninist.

00:21.345 --> 00:22.477
Same thing.

00:22.513 --> 00:24.146
He told you to put
a muzzle on me.

00:24.181 --> 00:25.480
He's lucky all I did
was punch him.

00:25.516 --> 00:26.748
All right, just so you know,

00:26.784 --> 00:28.250
that the, uh,
the Bureau is very big

00:28.285 --> 00:30.419
on accountability and remorse.

00:30.454 --> 00:32.119
But I'm not sorry
for my actions.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.622
Uh-uh.
They don't need to know that.

00:33.657 --> 00:35.657
You're making this
a much larger deal

00:35.692 --> 00:37.058
than it needs to be, Booth.

00:37.094 --> 00:38.960
So there's no scenario

00:38.996 --> 00:40.762
where you-you
could take my advice.

00:40.798 --> 00:43.098
Not off the top of my head,
unlikely.

00:43.133 --> 00:44.366
Okay, I got it.

00:44.401 --> 00:48.370
What if I do that thing, huh?

00:48.405 --> 00:49.638
That thing that you like.

00:49.673 --> 00:51.006
That you wrote about, uh,

00:51.041 --> 00:52.874
in your book on page 187.

00:52.910 --> 00:55.010
Bam.

00:55.045 --> 00:59.047
Well, as much
as I typically enjoy...

01:01.018 --> 01:05.120
...the thing on page 187,

01:05.155 --> 01:09.691
I'm not currently in the mood
for that particular thing.

01:09.726 --> 01:11.026
Ah, here's a good one. 92.

01:11.061 --> 01:12.594
The thing
that you talk about on 92.

01:12.629 --> 01:13.662
You love that.

01:13.697 --> 01:15.430
That involves a jump.
92.

01:15.466 --> 01:18.233
I'm not sure, but, um...

01:18.268 --> 01:20.469
I'll wear the rabbit ears.

01:20.504 --> 01:23.738
I might be persuaded
to take your advice

01:23.774 --> 01:26.575
for the thing on page 214.

01:26.610 --> 01:29.778
214. What's 214?

01:29.813 --> 01:31.413
Ah.

01:31.448 --> 01:32.948
Very tribal.

01:32.983 --> 01:35.417
We are in like Flynn.

01:35.452 --> 01:37.652
214. I will prepare the deck.

01:37.688 --> 01:38.920
I'll grab the masks.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.894
Is it possible
that we just watched

01:45.929 --> 01:48.230
seven Star Wars movies
in a row?

01:48.265 --> 01:50.398
Well, the extreme
pain in my lower back

01:50.434 --> 01:52.000
is making me believe
that it is.

01:52.035 --> 01:53.535
I told you you
should have done

01:53.570 --> 01:54.769
those stretches with me.

01:54.805 --> 01:56.738
Eh, I don't know, you know.

01:56.773 --> 01:58.974
The bridges and
the splitsy things,

01:59.009 --> 02:00.509
that just doesn't come
as naturally to me

02:00.544 --> 02:01.610
as it does to you.

02:01.645 --> 02:02.944
Well, fair enough.

02:02.980 --> 02:04.346
You know, my yoga coach
has mentioned

02:04.381 --> 02:05.614
that I have very open hips.

02:05.649 --> 02:06.882
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

02:06.917 --> 02:09.383
Yoga dude gettin'
a little handsy?

02:09.419 --> 02:11.987
Is that jealousy I sense?

02:12.022 --> 02:13.388
Why would I be jealous?

02:13.423 --> 02:16.324
It's not like you
and I are...

02:16.360 --> 02:19.194
No, I mean,
of course not.

02:19.229 --> 02:20.762
I mean, I would.

02:20.797 --> 02:22.631
You would?
Would you?

02:22.666 --> 02:24.165
Right now?

02:24.201 --> 02:25.367
It feels like a moment.

02:25.402 --> 02:26.434
And we've already let

02:26.470 --> 02:29.604
so many other moments pass by.

02:32.276 --> 02:33.842
Oh! Oh, oh.
Oh!

02:36.647 --> 02:37.979
Oh, wow, are you okay?

02:38.015 --> 02:38.947
Yeah, no, super, super okay.

02:40.584 --> 02:42.517
It's a dead body.
Wow.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.519
Nothing says romantic
like having your first kiss

02:44.555 --> 02:46.254
interrupted by murder.

02:49.726 --> 02:53.028
Or dirty street water.

02:57.834 --> 02:59.267
This is pretty gnarly.

02:59.303 --> 03:01.303
Yeah,
the victim was discovered

03:01.338 --> 03:04.806
by road crews cleaning up
a mudslide near Baltimore.

03:04.841 --> 03:06.541
Was that cause of death?

03:06.577 --> 03:08.710
I don't think so.

03:08.745 --> 03:11.046
The decomp's pretty advanced,
but the mudslide

03:11.081 --> 03:12.380
sure did a hell
of a job on the remains.

03:12.416 --> 03:13.848
Yeah, you're telling me.

03:13.884 --> 03:16.084
Check out all these fractures
on the X-rays.

03:16.119 --> 03:18.853
That slide was
one bumpy toboggan ride.

03:18.889 --> 03:20.288
Uh, the slightly raised ridge

03:20.324 --> 03:22.657
across the central surface
of the pubis,

03:22.693 --> 03:25.160
plus the
anteriorly-positioned mandible

03:25.195 --> 03:26.561
tell me the victim is female.

03:26.597 --> 03:29.798
And the receding zygomatics

03:29.833 --> 03:32.434
and wear on the dentition
suggest that the victim

03:32.469 --> 03:35.971
is of Negroid descent
and in her early 30s.

03:36.006 --> 03:38.940
Presence of hairy maggot blowfly
larvae suggests the victim

03:38.976 --> 03:40.842
was buried
in a shallow grave,

03:40.877 --> 03:43.612
approximately two weeks
before the mudslide.

03:43.647 --> 03:46.881
That tracks with the vitreous
humor in the remaining eyeball.

03:46.917 --> 03:48.283
Hey, honey,
is your shoulder okay?

03:48.318 --> 03:51.019
Hey, what time is
Brennan's hearing?

03:51.054 --> 03:52.520
Wait, hearing?

03:52.556 --> 03:54.055
What hearing?

03:54.091 --> 03:57.158
I think it's going on right now.

03:57.194 --> 03:59.628
Brennan punched a suspect.

03:59.663 --> 04:01.229
That's a big no-no at the FBI.

04:01.264 --> 04:03.064
Go, Dr. B.

04:03.100 --> 04:04.833
I knew there was a reason
she's my hero.

04:04.868 --> 04:07.469
Yeah, well, I think it's got her
into a bit of trouble now.

04:07.504 --> 04:08.837
Oh, come on.

04:08.872 --> 04:10.171
She's so good at her job,

04:10.207 --> 04:11.373
what could they
possibly do to her?

04:11.408 --> 04:12.707
<i>Dr. Brennan,</i>

04:12.743 --> 04:14.442
I'm not sure you understand

04:14.478 --> 04:16.111
the severity
of the situation.

04:16.146 --> 04:18.680
You assaulted a suspect.

04:18.714 --> 04:20.915
The FBI does not
take that lightly.

04:20.951 --> 04:22.050
Nonsense.

04:22.084 --> 04:23.718
Between the years 1993

04:23.754 --> 04:26.488
and 2011, FBI agents either

04:26.523 --> 04:31.026
injured or killed
150 people using firearms.

04:31.061 --> 04:32.627
Your internal investigations

04:32.663 --> 04:34.796
let each of those agents off
without a charge.

04:34.831 --> 04:37.932
You punched an unarmed man.

04:37.968 --> 04:39.434
And he deserved it.

04:39.469 --> 04:41.202
You seem to believe that

04:41.238 --> 04:43.405
that excuses your actions.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.106
That is correct.

04:46.643 --> 04:49.077
I have no more questions
at this moment.

04:49.112 --> 04:51.112
Tomorrow, we speak
to your partner.

04:51.148 --> 04:54.315
If his testimony goes anything
like yours, Dr. Brennan,

04:54.351 --> 04:58.153
you will no longer be allowed
to work with the Bureau.

04:58.188 --> 05:00.822
The panel is adjourned
until tomorrow.

05:41.266 --> 05:42.565
Hey.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.100
How did the hearing go?

05:44.135 --> 05:45.468
There seems to be a divide

05:45.503 --> 05:47.870
in our mutual understanding
of what occurred

05:47.906 --> 05:50.172
between Mr. Walters and myself.

05:50.208 --> 05:52.208
You're saying you
didn't punch him?

05:52.243 --> 05:53.776
Not at all.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.912
I merely argued that I should
not be held accountable.

05:55.947 --> 05:57.813
Bet they loved that.

05:57.849 --> 06:00.883
Unfortunately, I believe
it had the opposite effect.

06:00.919 --> 06:04.487
Uh, maybe we should
get back to the case.

06:04.522 --> 06:07.290
Hmm. Damage to
the heart muscle indicates

06:07.325 --> 06:09.191
significant endocarditis.

06:09.227 --> 06:10.559
Heart disease?
Actually,

06:10.595 --> 06:11.961
it looks more like
the kind of damage

06:11.996 --> 06:13.162
I see on drug addicts.

06:13.197 --> 06:14.563
I'll run a tox screen.

06:14.599 --> 06:16.232
Ms. Warren, what do you see

06:16.267 --> 06:20.136
regarding the surgical rod
in the victim's right femur?

06:20.171 --> 06:21.537
Remodeling?

06:21.572 --> 06:24.240
I'm referring
to the rod itself.

06:24.275 --> 06:25.574
There are no nails

06:25.610 --> 06:26.876
to hold it in place.

06:26.911 --> 06:28.377
This kind of surgical rod
has not been used

06:28.413 --> 06:31.447
in most orthopedic surgical
centers in decades.

06:31.482 --> 06:32.915
The injury's that old?

06:32.951 --> 06:35.384
Well, not according
to the remodeling,

06:35.420 --> 06:36.919
which appears
to be approximately

06:36.955 --> 06:38.354
four years old.

06:38.389 --> 06:39.689
Why was a recent injury

06:39.724 --> 06:42.091
treated with such
outdated equipment?

06:42.126 --> 06:43.492
It's unclear.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.762
However, it should be easy
to track the rod itself,

06:46.798 --> 06:48.731
given its uncommon nature.

06:48.766 --> 06:50.032
An injury that bad,

06:50.068 --> 06:51.600
she must have been
laid up for months.

06:51.636 --> 06:53.202
That's got to suck.

06:53.237 --> 06:54.837
Well, at least she walked again.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.105
Yes.

06:56.140 --> 06:57.840
I don't believe the injury

06:57.875 --> 06:59.875
caused any lasting damage.

06:59.911 --> 07:02.445
No, I think that
was about Hodgins.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.647
Uh, not to be too nosy,

07:04.682 --> 07:06.449
but you guys do seem a little...

07:06.484 --> 07:08.651
Cold? Distant?

07:08.686 --> 07:12.088
Or maybe the part where he takes
all of his crap out on me?

07:12.123 --> 07:13.723
Is it truly that bad?

07:13.758 --> 07:15.891
I don't think
it can get much worse.

07:15.927 --> 07:18.761
Honestly, he's pushing me away.

07:18.796 --> 07:21.731
Yeah, I did see that whole hand
to the shoulder shrug-off thing.

07:21.766 --> 07:24.834
Well, that's just
par for the course these days.

07:24.869 --> 07:26.969
Oh, here we go.

07:27.005 --> 07:28.971
Got it.

07:29.007 --> 07:30.606
All right.

07:30.641 --> 07:32.408
Now you can go get an ID.

07:32.443 --> 07:33.909
Uh, but you don't
have to go right now,

07:33.945 --> 07:37.313
'cause, you know, we're talking.

07:37.348 --> 07:38.481
It's okay.

07:38.516 --> 07:41.283
I, uh, I should stay busy.

07:45.656 --> 07:47.523
<i>You missed?</i>

07:47.558 --> 07:49.291
Wow.

07:49.327 --> 07:50.993
You've never kissed
a girl before, Aubrey?

07:51.029 --> 07:53.629
What? No, of course I have.
Lots of times.

07:53.664 --> 07:55.831
It's just... have you
ever tried to do something,

07:55.867 --> 07:58.534
but the timing was just all off?

07:58.569 --> 08:00.369
You know what?
The timing's off now.

08:00.405 --> 08:01.971
Let's just get back to the case,
all right?

08:02.006 --> 08:03.839
All right. Okay.

08:03.875 --> 08:06.108
Well, the body dump was
in a pretty isolated area.

08:06.144 --> 08:08.110
Not a lot of people
around there.

08:08.146 --> 08:09.945
Yeah, but if you go three miles
straight into Baltimore,

08:09.981 --> 08:11.814
you're gonna be smack right
in the middle of Perkins Homes.

08:11.849 --> 08:13.949
Gangland.
So what, you thinking drugs?

08:13.985 --> 08:15.818
That tracks with
the heart damage that Cam found.

08:15.853 --> 08:17.953
You ever hear of a drug
called a Wiley Monkey?

08:17.989 --> 08:20.523
Any relation to the coyote?

08:20.558 --> 08:22.892
Anyhow, it's a, uh,

08:22.927 --> 08:25.861
big drug now in, uh,
Southeast, uh, Baltimore.

08:25.897 --> 08:27.897
It has, what, cocaine, heroin,

08:27.932 --> 08:29.065
household cleaning products
in it.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.000
Did you tell Cam?

08:31.035 --> 08:33.102
Well, I was going to
until you came in here crying

08:33.136 --> 08:34.804
about all your girl problems.

08:34.839 --> 08:37.173
I'm not crying.
I just, I thought,

08:37.207 --> 08:38.506
you know,
maybe you could give me

08:38.543 --> 08:39.975
some words of advice,
if you have any.

08:40.010 --> 08:41.243
Okay, look, Aubrey.

08:41.279 --> 08:43.379
You know what?
There's, you know,

08:43.414 --> 08:44.914
the first kiss
is always awkward.

08:44.949 --> 08:46.482
There's lots of awkward moments.

08:46.517 --> 08:48.584
I mean, Bones and I, we had, uh,

08:48.619 --> 08:50.419
we had many awkward moments.

08:50.455 --> 08:52.521
Yeah, but now
you're happily married.

08:52.557 --> 08:54.056
Yeah, but we wouldn't
have been happily married

08:54.092 --> 08:58.194
if we gave up
after that first awkward moment.

08:59.931 --> 09:02.264
Angela,
these are spectacular.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.599
Really?

09:03.634 --> 09:06.735
A true improvement.

09:06.771 --> 09:08.704
Uh, you can sit down.

09:08.739 --> 09:13.275
It's just, uh, next time
can we meet at my studio?

09:13.311 --> 09:14.477
Oh, yeah.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.245
In-instead of here?

09:16.280 --> 09:17.546
It'd be more private.

09:17.582 --> 09:21.984
Oh, your studio
is Cam-free, right?

09:22.019 --> 09:24.687
Oh, uh...

09:24.722 --> 09:26.388
don't-don't

09:26.424 --> 09:27.890
let me interrupt.

09:27.925 --> 09:29.492
No, no, no, no.
No interruption.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.161
I'm actually
heading out the door.

09:34.365 --> 09:35.431
Set for next time?

09:35.466 --> 09:37.967
Yeah.

09:43.574 --> 09:45.274
That was weird.

09:45.309 --> 09:46.976
Yeah.

09:47.011 --> 09:49.278
So, what's set for next time?

09:49.313 --> 09:51.013
Oh, just where
we're gonna meet up

09:51.048 --> 09:53.983
so we can go over
these photos.

09:54.018 --> 09:55.384
What's up?

09:55.419 --> 09:59.155
My initial tox screen
came back negative,

09:59.190 --> 10:01.790
so I tested some adipose tissue.

10:01.826 --> 10:05.027
I'm pretty sure the victim was
drug-free for about a decade.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.863
I think I might know
why she stopped using.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.666
So, the only facility
in the area that still uses

10:10.701 --> 10:14.737
those outdated surgical rods
is a hospital in West Virginia.

10:14.772 --> 10:17.139
The facility
primarily treats inmates

10:17.175 --> 10:18.641
from the local penitentiary.

10:18.676 --> 10:20.042
So the victim

10:20.077 --> 10:22.411
was Lola Marshall, 32.

10:22.446 --> 10:25.080
She served 10 years
for dealing crack.

10:25.116 --> 10:26.882
Wait, does that say "fugitive?"

10:26.918 --> 10:28.350
Yeah.

10:28.386 --> 10:29.785
She was released from prison

10:29.820 --> 10:32.154
to the halfway house
in January.

10:32.190 --> 10:33.923
But she disappeared from there
two weeks ago.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.198
That's when
the warrant went out

10:35.226 --> 10:38.194
for her rearrest.

10:45.169 --> 10:47.937
I imagine the residents
of this neighborhood

10:47.972 --> 10:50.339
would be quite displeased
to have criminals

10:50.374 --> 10:52.007
living among them.

10:52.043 --> 10:54.577
It's definitely not
the suburban dream.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.546
You must be Agent Aubrey
and Dr. Brennan.

10:57.582 --> 10:59.181
Thomas Hemingway.

10:59.217 --> 11:01.283
You the owner of this
halfway house Mr. Hemingway?

11:01.319 --> 11:04.186
Thomas, and yes, uh,
I've owned and operated

11:04.222 --> 11:07.323
Next Step for nearly
seven years now.

11:08.859 --> 11:11.527
Hey, Louis.

11:11.562 --> 11:12.761
30 minutes late
for curfew last night.

11:12.797 --> 11:13.896
The bus ran late.

11:13.931 --> 11:15.064
You should have called.

11:15.099 --> 11:16.332
You know the rules.

11:16.367 --> 11:18.834
I'm gonna have
to write you up.

11:18.869 --> 11:21.403
And you know
what happens next time.

11:21.439 --> 11:23.072
What happens next time?

11:23.107 --> 11:24.773
I have to send him back.

11:24.809 --> 11:29.178
I have a responsibility to both
these inmates and the community.

11:29.213 --> 11:32.081
It means making
a lot of tough choices.

11:32.116 --> 11:34.049
Come on inside.

11:36.287 --> 11:38.621
Through this doorway is
our group therapy room.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.889
And, uh, was Lola involved
in group therapy as well?

11:40.925 --> 11:41.991
Certainly, yeah.

11:42.026 --> 11:43.359
We-we focus on

11:43.394 --> 11:45.894
coping mechanisms
in high-stress environments.

11:45.930 --> 11:48.631
Mock interviews,
conflict resolution.

11:48.666 --> 11:49.965
And how did Lola do with that?

11:50.001 --> 11:51.734
Well, actually.

11:51.769 --> 11:54.803
Uh, she got a job
almost immediately.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.272
Donuts R Us.

11:56.307 --> 11:58.107
Yeah, she was
a model inmate.

11:58.142 --> 12:01.110
Never missed curfew,
until, uh...

12:01.145 --> 12:03.312
Until she disappeared.

12:03.347 --> 12:04.680
Yeah.

12:04.715 --> 12:06.482
You think Lola
might have returned

12:06.517 --> 12:08.284
to her old lifestyle, don't you?

12:08.319 --> 12:10.452
I hope not, but...

12:10.488 --> 12:12.521
I couldn't say.

12:12.556 --> 12:14.456
Okay, well, who could?

12:14.492 --> 12:16.325
Lola's roommate, Jasmine.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.161
Uh, if anyone would know,
it's her.

12:23.012 --> 12:25.289
You had been Lola's roommate
since January--

12:25.290 --> 12:26.823
you two must have been close.

12:27.431 --> 12:28.764
Did she tell you
where she was going

12:28.799 --> 12:29.999
the night she disappeared?

12:30.034 --> 12:32.201
Mm-mm.

12:32.236 --> 12:34.069
Like you said,
me and Lola were pretty tight.

12:34.105 --> 12:36.772
If she was planning on leaving,
she would have told me.

12:36.807 --> 12:39.175
Did she ever tell you
about her life before prison?

12:39.210 --> 12:41.911
You mean her
slinging dope in the projects?

12:41.946 --> 12:43.179
Yeah.

12:43.214 --> 12:44.580
So do you think it's possible

12:44.615 --> 12:45.748
that Lola went back
to selling drugs?

12:45.783 --> 12:48.517
No.

12:48.553 --> 12:51.053
She told me this story.

12:51.088 --> 12:52.488
Like, four years ago in prison,

12:52.523 --> 12:53.756
White Angels of Mercy
beat the black off her

12:53.791 --> 12:55.324
one day in the showers.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.860
What does that have to do
with Lola's recidivism?

12:57.895 --> 13:00.362
Uh, she was in the infirmary
for months,

13:00.398 --> 13:01.964
bored out of her skull.

13:01.999 --> 13:04.833
That's when she got her GED,
turned her stuff around.

13:04.869 --> 13:07.770
No way she worked that hard
just to give it all up.

13:07.805 --> 13:09.939
Was there anyone
she didn't get along with?

13:09.974 --> 13:11.774
There was this chump,
Kenny J.

13:11.809 --> 13:13.976
He bounced out after
her first two weeks, though.

13:14.011 --> 13:15.611
What did Kenny have against her?

13:15.646 --> 13:17.346
Kenny was Lola's supplier.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.848
She turned state's on him
for a reduced sentence.

13:19.884 --> 13:21.717
Okay, did Kenny have
a last name?

13:21.752 --> 13:23.419
Johnson.

13:25.590 --> 13:27.256
You know this guy, Booth?

13:27.291 --> 13:29.258
Um, thanks, um,

13:29.293 --> 13:31.760
Kenny and I,
we were in prison together.

13:37.868 --> 13:39.235
<i>You have something</i>

13:39.270 --> 13:40.569
to show me, Ms. Warren?

13:40.605 --> 13:42.171
Oh, Dr. Saroyan, yes.

13:42.206 --> 13:43.839
Um, as I was re-articulating,

13:43.874 --> 13:46.475
I noticed extensive fractures

13:46.510 --> 13:49.612
on the ribs,
skull and scapulae.

13:49.647 --> 13:52.248
The severity makes me
think the victim

13:52.283 --> 13:54.550
was beaten with some kind
of blunt weapon.

13:54.585 --> 13:57.319
Repeated strikes indicate
a crime of passion,

13:57.355 --> 13:59.154
so this wasn't premeditated.

13:59.190 --> 14:01.523
Exactly. The killer
was probably super pissed.

14:01.559 --> 14:03.425
I'm vibing we've got
cause of death,

14:03.461 --> 14:05.694
but I think Dr. B's
gonna want more than that.

14:05.730 --> 14:08.063
Let me know when you have
a definitive answer

14:08.099 --> 14:10.399
on cause of death.

14:10.434 --> 14:11.634
<i>You do not need my permission</i>

14:11.669 --> 14:13.068
to do what you want to do,
Angela.

14:13.104 --> 14:15.304
I'm not asking
your permission. I...

14:15.339 --> 14:18.707
Can't we even just talk
about anything anymore?

14:18.743 --> 14:21.076
I just wanted
to know your opinion.

14:21.112 --> 14:22.945
You want to go spend time
with Sebastian in his studio.

14:22.980 --> 14:24.346
I support you.

14:24.382 --> 14:26.649
Then why does it sound
like you hate the idea?

14:26.684 --> 14:28.450
Forget how I sound.

14:28.486 --> 14:30.185
You do you, I'll do me.

14:30.221 --> 14:31.754
That's not how marriage works.

14:31.789 --> 14:33.022
At least,

14:33.057 --> 14:34.890
that's not
how our marriage works.

14:34.925 --> 14:37.059
Well, things change.

14:37.094 --> 14:39.361
Uh, sorry.
I'll come back.

14:39.397 --> 14:40.629
No, no, Cam.

14:40.665 --> 14:41.964
Your timing is perfect.

14:41.999 --> 14:43.299
Sure?

14:43.334 --> 14:44.967
Yeah, we... uh... we're fine.

14:45.002 --> 14:47.770
We're done talking,
or whatever you want to call

14:47.805 --> 14:50.039
what we were just doing.

14:51.142 --> 14:53.275
Okay.

14:53.311 --> 14:55.744
Hodgins, I wanted you
to take a look

14:55.780 --> 14:57.146
at this tissue.

14:57.181 --> 14:59.081
It looks like burn marks,

14:59.116 --> 15:01.684
but I haven't seen any other
signs of burning in the sludge.

15:01.719 --> 15:03.218
Neither did I on the remains.

15:03.254 --> 15:04.486
Okay, all right.
Just leave this with me.

15:04.522 --> 15:05.921
I'll test it for particulates

15:05.956 --> 15:07.756
and figure out what left
such an isolated mark.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.792
Thanks.

15:09.827 --> 15:13.495
I'm just gonna...

15:13.531 --> 15:15.631
Me, too.

15:20.338 --> 15:22.504
<i>I met Kenny in prison,</i>

15:22.540 --> 15:24.707
before they dropped
the charges against me.

15:24.742 --> 15:26.208
The guy's got
one hell of a record.

15:26.243 --> 15:27.743
Seems kind of dangerous.

15:27.778 --> 15:30.412
Okay, Kenny was the only guy
in there who had my back.

15:30.448 --> 15:32.381
It's not easy being friends
with a cop.

15:32.416 --> 15:34.216
That's fair enough,
but Baltimore PD

15:34.251 --> 15:35.851
has him listed
as a known suspect

15:35.886 --> 15:37.586
in at least two murders.

15:37.621 --> 15:39.021
Rumors. Nothing else.

15:39.056 --> 15:41.357
Why are you protecting this guy?
I told you.

15:41.392 --> 15:42.991
I know him, all right?

15:43.027 --> 15:45.060
He's a good guy,
or at least he's a reformed guy.

15:45.096 --> 15:47.196
I'm just saying,
try to keep an open mind.

15:47.231 --> 15:48.464
And I'm just saying,

15:48.499 --> 15:51.567
innocent until
proven guilty, right?

15:56.207 --> 15:57.639
Hey!

15:57.675 --> 15:59.141
Look at you.
Hot damn,

15:59.176 --> 16:00.476
that you Seeley Booth?
How are you?

16:00.511 --> 16:02.544
Kenny J, he looks good.
Hey, man.

16:02.580 --> 16:05.214
This here is my partner,
Agent Aubrey.

16:05.249 --> 16:07.015
Your partner.
Yeah.

16:07.051 --> 16:09.184
I'm guessing
this isn't a social call.

16:09.220 --> 16:12.054
I'll tell you what,
can we talk over here?

16:14.825 --> 16:17.593
All right, so, um,
, listen.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.228
Lola Marshall is dead.

16:19.263 --> 16:20.963
And you think I did it.

16:20.998 --> 16:22.898
We just got to rule you out,
Kenny. That's all.

16:22.933 --> 16:26.201
Actually, we're here
to ask you a few questions.

16:26.237 --> 16:27.870
When was the last time
you saw Lola?

16:27.905 --> 16:29.972
I don't know,
probably when I left Next Step.

16:30.007 --> 16:31.974
We ignored each other.

16:32.009 --> 16:33.342
All right, you grow up
the way I did,

16:33.377 --> 16:35.711
you get real good
at ignoring schmucks.

16:35.746 --> 16:37.179
Still,
living in the same house

16:37.214 --> 16:38.414
as the woman
who got you locked up--

16:38.449 --> 16:39.681
that must have been hard.

16:39.717 --> 16:41.784
Look, uh, you see that?

16:43.554 --> 16:45.821
That's just the one I got
for being chill with this guy.

16:45.856 --> 16:47.489
All right,
I got no interest in living

16:47.525 --> 16:49.258
with my head on a swivel again.
I'll tell you what,

16:49.293 --> 16:50.793
all we need is an alibi.
Where were you,

16:50.828 --> 16:52.561
uh, two weeks ago, late Friday?

16:52.596 --> 16:55.130
I had to guess,
I'd say at home, sleeping.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.565
Watching TV.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.066
Life's pretty boring, now.

16:58.102 --> 17:00.002
So, in other words,
you don't have an alibi.

17:00.037 --> 17:01.470
Look, Booth, you know me.

17:01.505 --> 17:02.738
I-I'm no killer.
Look, I'll tell you what,

17:02.773 --> 17:04.071
we know how to get
in touch with you

17:04.108 --> 17:05.574
if we have
any more questions, okay?

17:05.608 --> 17:06.809
I got a few quest...
I'm proud of you, Kenny.

17:06.844 --> 17:09.144
Take care of yourself,
all right?

17:09.180 --> 17:10.579
Come on.

17:10.614 --> 17:12.681
The hell was that?
He doesn't need an alibi?

17:12.715 --> 17:14.316
Booth, you're too close to this.
Stop, okay?

17:14.351 --> 17:15.751
You saw him.
The guy got stabbed for me.

17:15.786 --> 17:17.419
Yeah, but just because
he protected you then,

17:17.454 --> 17:19.054
doesn't mean it's right
for you to protect him now.

17:19.089 --> 17:20.722
Don't tell me how
to do my job, Aubrey.

17:20.758 --> 17:22.825
The guy's a suspect
in a murder investigation.

17:22.859 --> 17:24.626
My gut says there's nothing here.
Your gut?

17:24.662 --> 17:27.329
Booth, are you the lead
on this case or his friend?

17:27.364 --> 17:29.097
Get in the car.

17:30.972 --> 17:34.330
I'm here, caffeinated and
I'm ready to jam on some bones.

17:34.355 --> 17:35.454
Good timing.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.054
Hodgins just gave me
his analysis

17:37.090 --> 17:39.457
of the burn mark I found.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.992
It's gunshot residue,

17:41.027 --> 17:42.793
which means the victim
wasn't just beaten,

17:42.829 --> 17:44.061
she was shot.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.497
Aubrey tried to kiss me.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.566
Tried to kiss you?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.501
Yeah, it was
a weird timing thing.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.004
Um, but, our entire relationship
has been a weird timing thing.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.306
Oh, well, I didn't know that it
was technically a relationship.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.375
Because of the slowness.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.110
Glaciers move faster.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.679
Um, I mean,
I think the feelings are there,

18:01.714 --> 18:03.414
but what if it doesn't matter?

18:03.449 --> 18:05.483
What if the physical
is just never there?

18:05.518 --> 18:06.684
And then I never
have another orgasm,

18:06.719 --> 18:08.352
and life is just
a futile existence

18:08.388 --> 18:10.888
of jumping from one
binge-watched show to another.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.924
Wow.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.725
Jessica,
Aubrey is crazy about you.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.394
It's obvious.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.496
You think the fact that
it's taken you guys months

18:18.531 --> 18:21.799
to get to an actual kiss,
may have built it up a bit?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.136
It's so frustrating.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.939
I mean, I'm normally
the forward one.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.540
Why can't I be here?

18:29.576 --> 18:31.676
Because you're scared.

18:31.711 --> 18:32.977
Maybe you feel
differently about him

18:33.012 --> 18:34.845
than you have about anyone else.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.081
You know, it's easy
to want to run away

18:37.116 --> 18:38.683
from things that scare you.

18:38.718 --> 18:42.486
Easier than trying to fight
through the complications.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.289
Do you want to talk
about things?

18:45.325 --> 18:47.758
Yes. This gunshot wound.

18:47.794 --> 18:51.996
Until we find what part of
the body this tissue is from...

18:52.031 --> 18:54.232
We won't know whether
the gunshot wound was fatal.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.399
Exactly.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.968
I'm on it.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.179
Wow.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.915
Oh, my God.

19:10.950 --> 19:15.920
These are incredible.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.122
Each is a piece of my soul.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.292
That's what
photography is, Angela.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.427
It's finding the truth,

19:23.463 --> 19:25.463
the beauty,
where you least expect it.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.831
Yeah, but how do you...

19:26.866 --> 19:29.166
how do you know where to look?

19:29.202 --> 19:30.968
You don't.

19:31.004 --> 19:34.505
Not at first, at least.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.274
It calls to me, though.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.376
What does?

19:38.411 --> 19:41.078
Beauty.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.667
Sebastian.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.137
Angela.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.311
- Oh, Angela.
<i>- Angela.</i>

20:13.346 --> 20:14.612
Angela.

20:16.983 --> 20:20.151
Oh.

20:20.186 --> 20:22.053
Hi, what are you...

20:22.088 --> 20:23.321
what are you doing here?

20:23.356 --> 20:25.656
I thought you were having
a bad dream.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.759
Uh, yeah, I-I was.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.996
I-I-I have not been
sleeping well lately.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.731
Anyway, I think I narrowed down

20:33.766 --> 20:35.666
where the victim was
the day she died.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.134
Great. Great. You should...

20:37.170 --> 20:39.437
You should tell
Booth and Aubrey.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.771
Yeah, that's where I was heading

20:40.807 --> 20:42.407
before I heard you
talking in your sleep.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.411
You said his name, you know.

21:02.228 --> 21:05.296
<i>So we know that our victim</i>

21:05.331 --> 21:06.530
was somewhere
in Northeast Baltimore

21:06.566 --> 21:07.932
the day she was killed.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.967
The tower that her
cell phone pinged off of,

21:10.002 --> 21:11.836
it services
this three-mile radius

21:11.871 --> 21:13.270
right around here.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.509
I'm a visual person, okay?

21:18.544 --> 21:20.077
I got to be able to see it.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.946
Identifying the problem--
that's half the battle.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.781
I-I found
two other anomalies,

21:23.816 --> 21:25.082
when I was searching
through the sludge, right?

21:25.118 --> 21:26.283
The first one being rock salt.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.585
The stuff that they use

21:27.620 --> 21:28.719
to defrost the streets
when it snows?

21:28.755 --> 21:29.854
Yeah, that's right.

21:29.889 --> 21:30.988
Now, this type of rock salt,

21:31.023 --> 21:32.156
it's composed of sodium chloride

21:32.191 --> 21:34.091
and contains traces of cyanide.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.559
Great, so the
public service departments

21:35.595 --> 21:36.861
are trying to kill us.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.429
Well, unfortunately,
due to its toxicity,

21:38.464 --> 21:39.964
it's only used in certain

21:39.999 --> 21:42.233
poorer neighborhoods,
like this one right in here.

21:42.268 --> 21:43.501
That is still
a lot of territory to cover.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.536
You still haven't heard

21:44.570 --> 21:46.036
the pièce de résistance:

21:46.072 --> 21:49.140
Fresh tar
on the victim's shoe treads.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.609
In our narrowed-down
area here,

21:51.644 --> 21:53.978
of French fry quarter,
the only street being re-paved

21:54.013 --> 21:56.113
on the day of Lola's murder,
was this one here,

21:56.149 --> 21:57.882
Kennison Avenue, right by

21:57.917 --> 21:59.617
the Arlington Estate Co-ops.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.920
So what was Lola doing
at the Co-ops?

22:02.955 --> 22:04.121
I don't know, man.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.389
That's all you.

22:08.461 --> 22:11.629
I found slight fractures
on the inferior surfaces

22:11.664 --> 22:12.963
of the carpals.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.131
At first,
I thought they were postmortem,

22:14.167 --> 22:15.733
maybe even the result

22:15.768 --> 22:16.967
of the mudslide
she was buried in.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.069
You were mistaken.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.772
Yes. The inferior surfaces

22:21.808 --> 22:25.476
of the carpals and tarsals,
are fractured in the same way,

22:25.511 --> 22:28.312
indicative of
a repeated stress injury

22:28.347 --> 22:29.814
over a short period of time.

22:29.849 --> 22:30.981
Suggesting?

22:31.017 --> 22:33.184
Suggesting the victim
fought back.

22:33.219 --> 22:34.518
These are defensive wounds.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.620
You are incorrect again,
Ms. Warren.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.722
I have seen injuries
similar to these

22:38.758 --> 22:41.125
in instances where
the victim was buried alive.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.359
The fractures are reflective

22:42.395 --> 22:44.094
of clawing or kicking

22:44.130 --> 22:47.264
her way out
of an enclosed space.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.532
Whoa.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.935
This just got way darker
and creepier.

22:50.970 --> 22:54.805
Oh, um,
I found something else.

22:54.841 --> 22:57.441
Note the slight widening

22:57.477 --> 22:59.977
of the victim's
pubic symphysis.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.946
The victim
has given birth before.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.614
While she was still maturing.

23:03.649 --> 23:06.984
You are speculating
that the baby

23:07.019 --> 23:08.986
is now old enough
to be the killer.

23:09.021 --> 23:11.455
An angry kid abandoned
by his mother?

23:11.491 --> 23:13.691
<i> You know,</i>
<i>it's interesting to me</i>

23:13.726 --> 23:15.392
that you didn't even

23:15.428 --> 23:17.061
visit or-or speak to your mother

23:17.096 --> 23:19.964
the whole time
that she was in prison.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.233
She didn't want me,
why should I want her?

23:22.268 --> 23:25.402
Anger and resentment
are very rational feelings

23:25.438 --> 23:27.304
after being abandoned
by a parent.

23:27.340 --> 23:28.806
So what?

23:28.841 --> 23:31.876
So those feelings
didn't just go away

23:31.911 --> 23:34.078
when she moved
to the halfway house.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.213
Maybe she tried to look you up,

23:36.249 --> 23:39.116
and you couldn't see
that she'd changed.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.519
You're bitter, so you
lashed out, and you killed her.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.754
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:43.789 --> 23:45.356
Okay, then what changed?

23:45.391 --> 23:46.824
Why go back
and visit her now,

23:46.859 --> 23:48.659
after all of these years?

23:50.796 --> 23:51.929
You're sweating,

23:51.964 --> 23:54.532
and it's only 70 degrees
in here.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.100
You're showing evidence

23:56.135 --> 23:58.402
of ptyalism,
and your nostrils

23:58.437 --> 24:00.437
have begun broadening.
Ptyalism, right.

24:00.473 --> 24:02.106
Except, what does that mean?

24:02.141 --> 24:03.741
She's pregnant.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.276
I'm right, aren't I?

24:06.312 --> 24:08.245
Yes.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.047
I'm three months.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.448
Well, taking care of yourself

24:11.484 --> 24:14.451
after aging out of the system
is scary enough.

24:14.487 --> 24:16.453
Taking care of a baby
on top of that...

24:16.489 --> 24:17.755
Maybe you thought
that your mother

24:17.790 --> 24:19.423
owed you something.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.958
Then maybe you thought
you can get something from her.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.626
Then you found out
that she had nothing.

24:22.662 --> 24:23.861
And then you snapped.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.730
You think I killed her?!

24:26.766 --> 24:28.532
No way!

24:28.568 --> 24:31.302
She said she wanted us
to be a family.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.737
She said she wanted
to take care of us.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.172
That she had a real job,

24:35.207 --> 24:38.242
and that she was gonna
break the cycle.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.511
So I said okay.

24:40.546 --> 24:42.580
I wanted that, too.

24:45.451 --> 24:48.919
I didn't kill her.

24:48.955 --> 24:51.589
I let myself believe
that I have a future,

24:51.624 --> 24:54.158
but, I...

24:56.596 --> 24:58.495
...I'm alone again.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.233
Kalani,
you need to tell us

25:03.269 --> 25:06.837
if there's anything
about your mother's life

25:06.872 --> 25:09.039
that may have gotten her killed.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.809
She seemed...

25:11.844 --> 25:13.777
excited.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.813
She-she was saving up so that

25:15.848 --> 25:19.149
when I turn 18 we could get
an apartment together.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.987
We were making plans.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.155
Okay, look, were there
any changes in habit here?

25:25.191 --> 25:27.091
Did she have any
new acquaintances in her life?

25:27.126 --> 25:28.158
Anything like that?

25:28.194 --> 25:31.195
Uh, the last time I saw her,

25:31.230 --> 25:35.466
sh-she was frustrated,
because she had to leave early.

25:35.501 --> 25:39.370
Something a-about some friend,
some Kenny guy,

25:39.405 --> 25:41.271
was waiting
in the car for her.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.540
Kenny, Kenny Johnson?

25:43.576 --> 25:45.909
I don't know his last name.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.379
Just that they were
at the halfway house together.

25:53.942 --> 25:58.780
Note the slight abrasions
on the superior nuchal line.

25:58.785 --> 26:00.255
Damage from the mudslide?

26:00.287 --> 26:01.922
Uh, I do not believe so.

26:01.956 --> 26:05.025
These appear to be perimortem
and are inconsistent

26:05.059 --> 26:08.329
with any of
the other injuries sustained

26:08.361 --> 26:11.032
during the victim's murder.

26:11.064 --> 26:14.068
Which is why I want you
to swab for trace.

26:16.469 --> 26:20.605
Booth and I spoke
with Lola's daughter, Kalani.

26:20.640 --> 26:21.772
The foster kid.

26:21.808 --> 26:23.007
How did that go?

26:23.042 --> 26:25.009
I remember being her age,

26:25.044 --> 26:27.345
and having no one to turn to,

26:27.380 --> 26:30.181
and having no idea

26:30.216 --> 26:32.283
what was coming next.

26:32.318 --> 26:34.752
I recall a feeling

26:34.787 --> 26:35.987
of being overtaken,

26:36.022 --> 26:37.955
as though, if I forced myself,

26:37.991 --> 26:40.658
to think about the future,
I would implode.

26:40.693 --> 26:43.995
Angela tell you to talk to me?

26:44.030 --> 26:46.697
No.

26:46.733 --> 26:49.634
But, Dr. Hodgins,
you're my friend

26:49.669 --> 26:52.103
and my colleague,
and I care about you.

26:55.041 --> 26:56.407
Sometimes it doesn't matter

26:56.442 --> 26:59.243
if you have
the whole world supporting you,

26:59.278 --> 27:03.481
success can be
just out of reach.

27:03.516 --> 27:04.915
Then success must be redefined

27:04.951 --> 27:08.953
as that
which can be accomplished.

27:08.988 --> 27:10.154
If Kalani can't have

27:10.189 --> 27:12.890
a family with her mother
and her child,

27:12.925 --> 27:15.660
then she must
find an alternative

27:15.695 --> 27:16.961
that she can live with.

27:16.996 --> 27:18.863
And if I can't find
an alternative?

27:18.898 --> 27:21.899
You have to to survive.

27:21.934 --> 27:24.268
You make a faulty assumption,
Dr. Brennan.

27:24.303 --> 27:26.871
Survival doesn't
necessarily mean living.

27:36.049 --> 27:37.515
Kenny.

27:39.218 --> 27:40.484
Booth, what's up, man?

27:40.520 --> 27:41.552
What's up is that
you lied to me.

27:41.587 --> 27:43.120
Last time I asked you

27:43.156 --> 27:46.390
if you saw Lola, and you
said it was, like, months.

27:46.426 --> 27:48.959
Now I find out that you saw her
the day she disappeared?

27:48.995 --> 27:50.461
Look, you don't know
what it's like.

27:50.496 --> 27:51.729
All right,
you got out of prison,

27:51.764 --> 27:53.097
right back to your cush job.

27:53.132 --> 27:54.532
Me?

27:54.567 --> 27:56.567
To the world,
I'm just an ex-con.

27:56.602 --> 27:58.402
Do you know how hard
it was for me to get a job

27:58.438 --> 27:59.704
with my record?

27:59.739 --> 28:00.871
I mean, they find out
I'm involved

28:00.907 --> 28:02.339
in an FBI investigation,

28:02.375 --> 28:04.041
how long you think
they'll let me stay?

28:04.077 --> 28:05.609
And I didn't kill that woman.

28:05.645 --> 28:07.778
Then why didn't you just say
you were with her?

28:09.816 --> 28:11.182
You know, back in the day,
Lola ran product for me.

28:11.217 --> 28:12.349
All right, best thing
you can do right now

28:12.385 --> 28:13.751
is tell me something

28:13.786 --> 28:15.252
that I don't know.

28:17.423 --> 28:19.090
Kalani's mine.

28:19.125 --> 28:21.058
You and Lola
were in a relationship?

28:21.094 --> 28:23.961
No, it was casual,
part of the lifestyle.

28:23.996 --> 28:25.463
Of course, she didn't tell me
the baby was mine

28:25.498 --> 28:26.931
until a month ago.

28:26.966 --> 28:29.934
Wow.

28:29.969 --> 28:32.269
It's not like you guys
were on good terms, though.

28:32.305 --> 28:35.372
She was all about
giving Kalani a family.

28:35.408 --> 28:38.709
It wasn't about me and her
getting together, she just...

28:38.745 --> 28:40.778
I don't know, man,
she just wanted Kalani

28:40.813 --> 28:42.279
to know she has a dad.

28:42.315 --> 28:43.981
Uh, sounds like to me,
that she wanted

28:44.016 --> 28:45.783
the three of you to have
a second chance.

28:45.818 --> 28:48.953
Well, anyway,
I couldn't go through with it.

28:48.988 --> 28:50.621
I mean, look at me, man.

28:50.656 --> 28:52.890
You think I'm a worthy dad?

28:52.925 --> 28:55.392
If I was my dad,
I'd run the other way.

28:56.929 --> 28:58.996
All right, so yeah,
I stayed in the car.

28:59.031 --> 29:00.698
And then drove Lola
back to Next Step.

29:00.733 --> 29:02.666
And that's the last I saw her.

29:02.702 --> 29:04.235
I swear.

29:14.113 --> 29:17.648
I had a sex dream
about Sebastian.

29:17.683 --> 29:20.451
And Hodgins knows.

29:22.722 --> 29:26.290
Okay.

29:26.325 --> 29:28.492
Well, um...

29:30.930 --> 29:35.499
Angela, do you intend to cheat
on Hodgins with Sebastian?

29:36.569 --> 29:38.035
No.

29:38.070 --> 29:40.437
No.

29:40.473 --> 29:43.641
Except what if part
of me wants to?

29:43.676 --> 29:45.543
I mean, I don't, I don't want
to cheat on Hodgins.

29:45.578 --> 29:46.977
I love him.

29:47.013 --> 29:51.482
At least, I love the Hodgins
that I married.

29:51.517 --> 29:53.117
You believe his injury

29:53.152 --> 29:55.719
has damaged him irreparably?

29:55.755 --> 29:57.521
Hasn't it?

29:57.557 --> 29:59.690
It's not even
about him not walking.

29:59.725 --> 30:01.091
It's-it's him.

30:01.127 --> 30:03.327
He's different. He's...

30:03.362 --> 30:06.764
distant.

30:06.799 --> 30:09.767
It just... it doesn't feel
like a real marriage anymore.

30:09.802 --> 30:13.571
The injury didn't impact
Hodgins' spinal reflexes

30:13.606 --> 30:14.972
at a sacral level.

30:15.007 --> 30:17.708
He's still sexually capable.

30:17.743 --> 30:22.546
Yeah, everything about him
is still capable of it.

30:22.582 --> 30:25.716
It just doesn't make
a difference if he's given up.

30:25.751 --> 30:28.953
He can't fix that void,

30:28.988 --> 30:31.488
if he doesn't
take responsibility

30:31.524 --> 30:33.858
for creating it.

30:33.893 --> 30:39.263
I-I-I can't make him change
unless he wants to.

30:39.298 --> 30:42.399
And if he never wants to?

30:52.044 --> 30:54.378
<i>The rug in here</i>

30:54.413 --> 30:56.881
is a definite match
for the fiber Hodgins found

30:56.916 --> 30:58.115
in the occipital injury.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.683
So Jasmine and Lola's room

30:59.719 --> 31:01.085
could be our crime scene.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.554
Hodgins also found
trace of brass.

31:03.589 --> 31:05.723
Uh, maybe from what
she was beaten with?

31:07.827 --> 31:09.460
Hey, um,

31:09.495 --> 31:11.228
so should we talk?

31:11.264 --> 31:14.632
You mean,
instead of awkwardly avoiding

31:14.667 --> 31:16.066
the pink elephant in the room?

31:16.102 --> 31:17.368
Yeah, something like that.

31:17.403 --> 31:18.535
Then, no.

31:18.571 --> 31:19.703
Uh, not now.

31:19.739 --> 31:20.971
Let's get through this case.

31:23.476 --> 31:26.543
This looks like brass.

31:26.579 --> 31:27.978
It's not working.

31:28.014 --> 31:30.047
It's got a broken bulb in it.

31:30.082 --> 31:31.348
For a lamp that's not working,
this one

31:31.384 --> 31:33.584
sure is lighting up
like a Christmas tree.

31:33.619 --> 31:34.385
Blood?

31:34.420 --> 31:36.387
Definitely.

31:36.422 --> 31:37.955
What the hell
are y'all doing in my room?

31:37.990 --> 31:39.356
This here's private property.

31:39.392 --> 31:40.958
Jasmine Santangelo,

31:40.993 --> 31:42.526
you're under arrest
for the murder of your roommate,

31:42.561 --> 31:43.761
Lola Marshall.

31:43.796 --> 31:45.429
Man, hell no... what the...

31:45.464 --> 31:46.830
Aubrey.

31:49.535 --> 31:51.168
Got something else.

31:51.203 --> 31:52.436
You gonna deny

31:52.471 --> 31:55.439
that those drugs
belong to you, too?

31:55.474 --> 31:56.774
I didn't think so.

31:56.809 --> 31:58.442
Let's go.

32:06.898 --> 32:10.883
Found over a half kilo of Wiley
Monkey in your room, Jasmine.

32:10.983 --> 32:12.883
You can't prove that's mine.

32:12.919 --> 32:14.946
Shouldn't be hard to convince
a jury that a killer,

32:14.947 --> 32:17.348
fresh out of jail,
got involved in the drug trade

32:17.383 --> 32:18.582
and another murder.

32:18.618 --> 32:20.684
I didn't mean to
kill my stepdad.

32:20.720 --> 32:23.954
I just wanted him to leave me
alone and stop touching me,

32:23.990 --> 32:25.789
and I swear I didn't kill Lola.

32:25.825 --> 32:27.958
Here's how it went down
in my head.

32:27.994 --> 32:31.061
She found your stash,
threatened to turn you in,

32:31.097 --> 32:33.330
so you beat her to death
with that lamp.

32:33.366 --> 32:35.232
Man, I didn't even know
she was dead

32:35.268 --> 32:37.735
until y'all FBI agents
showed up at Next Step.

32:37.770 --> 32:39.537
I liked Lola.

32:39.572 --> 32:41.038
She was good to me.

32:41.073 --> 32:42.239
I didn't hurt her.

32:42.275 --> 32:43.374
Somebody did.

32:43.409 --> 32:44.975
Maybe your supplier found out

32:45.011 --> 32:46.877
that she knew
your little secret.

32:46.913 --> 32:49.346
Jasmine,

32:49.382 --> 32:52.016
listen to me.
I want to believe you,

32:52.051 --> 32:53.584
but you've got to give me
something to go on here.

32:53.619 --> 32:56.453
I can't.

32:56.489 --> 32:58.389
It doesn't matter if I talk.

32:58.424 --> 33:00.791
Either you'll throw me back
in prison, or he will kill me.

33:00.826 --> 33:03.394
He who?

33:03.429 --> 33:06.964
I can't tell you.

33:06.999 --> 33:09.533
I can't.

33:12.405 --> 33:13.904
<i>Ms. Warren.</i>

33:13.940 --> 33:16.340
Please take a look
at the posterior surfaces

33:16.375 --> 33:20.811
of the left third
through fifth vertebral ribs.

33:20.846 --> 33:23.914
Now, run your finger
along the damage.

33:25.451 --> 33:27.484
It feels like pitting.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.320
I don't understand.

33:29.355 --> 33:31.789
How does this help us
find the path of the bullet?

33:31.824 --> 33:33.090
It doesn't.

33:33.125 --> 33:34.825
This pitting is not
the direct result

33:34.860 --> 33:35.960
of the bullet wound.

33:35.995 --> 33:37.428
So how does that help us?

33:37.463 --> 33:39.663
Have Dr. Hodgins
swab for trace.

33:39.699 --> 33:41.231
I need to find Angela.

33:41.267 --> 33:42.933
<i>So the victim</i>

33:42.969 --> 33:46.737
was leaning up against
something, like a wall?

33:46.772 --> 33:48.505
Based on the severity
of the blunt force trauma,

33:48.541 --> 33:50.674
I would postulate
that it's much more likely

33:50.710 --> 33:53.477
that at least initially,
she was lying down,

33:53.512 --> 33:55.346
near unconsciousness.

33:55.381 --> 33:57.348
Now, I believe when the bullet
passed through her body,

33:57.383 --> 33:58.949
it hit the surface
she was lying on,

33:58.985 --> 34:02.953
causing debris to
blow back into her ribs.

34:02.989 --> 34:06.123
Debris that was hard enough
to cause pitting on the bones.

34:06.158 --> 34:07.458
Got something for you.

34:07.493 --> 34:08.792
Dr. Hodgins.

34:08.828 --> 34:10.194
Do you have the results

34:10.228 --> 34:11.795
of your swabs of the injuries?

34:11.831 --> 34:14.431
Yeah, I ran them
through microspectrophotometry,

34:14.467 --> 34:17.201
and found traces of steel
and also carpet fiber.

34:17.235 --> 34:19.902
It's a polyester
and polyolefin blend,

34:19.938 --> 34:21.472
like what you'd find
in the trunk of a car.

34:21.507 --> 34:25.909
Angela, now place the victim
inside the trunk of a car.

34:25.945 --> 34:28.145
The amount of damage
caused by the beating

34:28.179 --> 34:31.181
suggests the killer
presumed Lola was dead

34:31.217 --> 34:33.417
when he placed her
in the vehicle.

34:33.452 --> 34:35.452
You think
she regained consciousness

34:35.487 --> 34:38.222
and tried to claw her way out
as he was driving.

34:38.257 --> 34:41.257
Then when the killer
reached the dumpsite,

34:41.293 --> 34:43.527
he found she was still alive,
and he shot her.

34:43.562 --> 34:45.529
The bullet hit the bottom
of the trunk with enough force

34:45.563 --> 34:50.100
to cause the blowback
which ricocheted into her body.

34:50.136 --> 34:52.402
Dr. Hodgins, can you determine
the kind of car

34:52.438 --> 34:54.804
based on the carpet fibers
and the metal alloy?

34:54.840 --> 34:56.407
Uh, yeah, actually,
I already did.

34:56.442 --> 34:58.742
Mazda, BMW,
Ford Mustang and Fusion.

34:58.778 --> 35:00.978
Wait, BMW?

35:01.013 --> 35:03.814
There was a BMW
at the halfway house.

35:03.849 --> 35:06.483
Uh, I'll notify
Booth and Aubrey.

35:06.519 --> 35:08.052
I-I already told you guys
everything I know.

35:08.087 --> 35:10.454
No. We think you might
have left out a few details.

35:10.489 --> 35:12.723
Such as the fact
that you're the murderer.

35:15.361 --> 35:17.394
That's bull.

35:17.430 --> 35:19.563
I mean,
you don't have any proof.

35:19.598 --> 35:21.832
Lola discovered Jasmine
was working for you.

35:21.867 --> 35:25.002
She refused to participate
in your scam, didn't she?

35:25.037 --> 35:26.637
Maybe she even threatened
to turn you in?

35:26.672 --> 35:29.039
You couldn't stand for that,
so you beat her,

35:29.075 --> 35:30.174
and you threw her in your car.

35:30.209 --> 35:31.608
When you saw
she was still alive,

35:31.644 --> 35:32.743
you shot her.

35:32.778 --> 35:33.744
That's a great story.

35:33.779 --> 35:35.112
Great story.

35:35.147 --> 35:37.114
I don't know
who's gonna believe you.

35:37.149 --> 35:38.949
I-I-I'm a public servant.

35:38.984 --> 35:40.451
I have years of experience.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.820
But our lab
can tie Lola's body

35:42.855 --> 35:44.888
and injuries directly
to your car.

35:44.924 --> 35:47.691
We have indisputable physical
evidence, Mr. Hemingway.

35:50.996 --> 35:55.432
Was it so wrong wanting to make
a little something on the side?

35:55.468 --> 35:58.469
You know, do something
for myself for once.

35:58.504 --> 36:00.170
I mean, half those fools,

36:00.206 --> 36:02.706
they'd be back in the lifestyle
with or without me.

36:02.742 --> 36:06.410
I bet they can't wait to see you
on the other side of the bars.

36:06.445 --> 36:08.946
Okay, you can't send me there.

36:08.981 --> 36:10.547
They'll kill me.

36:10.583 --> 36:12.349
Relax, Thomas.
I'm sure they'll show you

36:12.384 --> 36:15.219
the same kindness
that you showed them.

36:30.970 --> 36:32.836
You ready to go home?

36:32.872 --> 36:34.905
Yes, but not with you.

36:36.642 --> 36:39.143
Okay, look, if this is about the
dream, then I think that we...

36:39.178 --> 36:41.945
This has nothing to do
with your dream, Angela.

36:41.981 --> 36:44.314
What is this?

36:44.350 --> 36:46.116
That's everything.

36:46.152 --> 36:48.152
It's all my money, property,

36:48.187 --> 36:50.687
and it's all yours.

36:50.723 --> 36:52.689
Whoa, wait, um, I'm sorry.

36:52.725 --> 36:56.460
I... this feels like, um,
are you trying to...

36:56.495 --> 36:58.362
We're broken.

36:58.397 --> 36:59.863
And it's my fault,

36:59.899 --> 37:01.865
because I am...

37:01.901 --> 37:04.168
miserable.

37:04.203 --> 37:05.869
And what's worse is

37:05.905 --> 37:07.838
I'm making you miserable.

37:07.873 --> 37:10.107
So change.

37:10.142 --> 37:12.009
I know that this is
painful for you,

37:12.044 --> 37:13.777
and I know that you think

37:13.813 --> 37:16.513
that I couldn't
possibly understand

37:16.549 --> 37:18.115
what it's like.

37:18.150 --> 37:20.651
But this is life.

37:20.686 --> 37:23.453
It's hard, and it is painful,

37:23.489 --> 37:25.856
and it is every day.

37:25.891 --> 37:27.858
But we fight.

37:27.893 --> 37:29.960
We fight together.

37:29.995 --> 37:31.361
This is my decision.

37:31.397 --> 37:34.298
No, this is a coward's decision.

37:34.333 --> 37:36.066
I am not letting you make it.

37:38.504 --> 37:42.005
I don't care about any
of the stuff in this folder.

37:42.041 --> 37:44.708

39:40.559 --> 39:43.160
Have you ever noticed it's
never too cold for ice cream?

39:43.195 --> 39:44.461
Oh, are you cold?

39:44.496 --> 39:46.296
Here.

39:49.335 --> 39:51.501
Aw, thanks, boyfriend.

39:51.537 --> 39:55.138
I mean,
my friend who is a boy.

39:55.174 --> 39:57.441
Attaboy, Aubrey.

39:57.476 --> 39:59.710
So, I, uh,

39:59.745 --> 40:01.678
want to kiss you.

40:01.714 --> 40:04.481
Uh, do you think
maybe it means something

40:04.516 --> 40:06.316
that you haven't yet,
that we haven't...

40:06.352 --> 40:07.484
No, it's my fault.

40:07.519 --> 40:08.986
I mean, I built
it up in my head,

40:09.021 --> 40:10.954
and now it's like
this big T. Rex.

40:10.990 --> 40:12.055
Big with short arms?

40:12.091 --> 40:13.724
Yeah, it's-it's scary.

40:13.759 --> 40:15.625
Yeah, I get that, um.

40:15.661 --> 40:17.327
Yeah, but, um, uh,
I'm not in a rush.

40:17.363 --> 40:19.129
Are you?

40:19.164 --> 40:21.999
I mean, normally, I'm really
good at this kind of thing.

40:22.034 --> 40:24.668
You know what that tells me?

40:24.703 --> 40:28.005
That what you and I have
isn't normal.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.974
It's more special than that.

40:35.314 --> 40:36.513
See you tomorrow?

40:36.548 --> 40:38.849
Count on it.

40:43.922 --> 40:45.422
Jessica!

41:06.979 --> 41:08.912
I take full responsibility
for my aggressive actions

41:08.947 --> 41:10.013
against Paul Walters,

41:10.049 --> 41:11.681
and I am prepared
to accept

41:11.717 --> 41:14.518
the punishment
that fits the crime.

41:14.553 --> 41:16.620
Agent Booth,
are you in agreement

41:16.655 --> 41:17.788
with your partner's assessment

41:17.823 --> 41:19.022
of the situation in question?

41:19.058 --> 41:20.891
Completely.

41:20.926 --> 41:23.593
And you are convinced
that such actions

41:23.629 --> 41:25.462
will not be repeated
in the future?

41:31.336 --> 41:34.037
You see, Dr. Brennan represents
this Bureau and its values

41:34.073 --> 41:37.174
more than any agent
that I have ever worked with.

41:37.209 --> 41:39.743
I mean, sh-she made a mistake.

41:39.778 --> 41:41.445
Look, we all do.

41:41.480 --> 41:44.181
And we all
are gonna make mistakes

41:44.216 --> 41:46.183
in the future,
and we should be able

41:46.218 --> 41:47.884
to make those mistakes.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.786
We should be able
to learn from them,

41:49.822 --> 41:51.455
grow from them,

41:51.490 --> 41:54.057
and be given a second chance.

41:54.093 --> 41:56.893
I mean, will Bones here
ever punch anyone again?

41:56.929 --> 41:58.495
I-I-I can't say,

41:58.530 --> 42:02.632
but you should give
her a chance to try.

42:03.902 --> 42:06.636
You want this committee
to forego punishment

42:06.672 --> 42:09.639
so Dr. Brennan can try
not to hit people?

42:09.675 --> 42:12.509
I will not be trying;
I will succeed.

42:12.544 --> 42:14.111
I have no doubt you will.

42:14.146 --> 42:16.246
With Agent Booth's help.

42:16.281 --> 42:18.014
Exactly. I'm sorry?

42:18.050 --> 42:19.816
Dr. Brennan,
this committee is placing you

42:19.852 --> 42:21.551
on six month's probation,

42:21.587 --> 42:24.187
to be overseen
by Agent Booth.

42:24.223 --> 42:25.422
A failure on your part

42:25.457 --> 42:27.390
will be considered
a failure on his part.

42:27.426 --> 42:28.003
We'll take it.

42:28.027 --> 42:30.561
No, no. Agent Booth
didn't do anything wrong.

42:30.562 --> 42:32.529
He should not be held
accountable for my actions.

42:32.564 --> 42:34.498
It doesn't matter because you're
not going to do it again, right?

42:34.533 --> 42:35.799
That's not the point.
It is the point.

42:35.834 --> 42:37.134
You're... you are gonna do it again?
No.

42:37.169 --> 42:38.568
Booth.
What?

42:38.604 --> 42:40.203
Has a decision been made here?

42:40.239 --> 42:41.505
Can you just give me one second?
Clearly not the point.

42:41.540 --> 42:42.739
The point is,
that you're not gonna

42:42.774 --> 42:44.608
hit anyone again, right?
That's not the point.

42:45.042 --> 42:47.250
She's not... she's not going
to hit anyone ever again.

42:47.350 --> 42:49.153
- We accept.
- We're not accepting.

42:49.154 --> 42:50.496
- We accept.
- No. We are not...

42:50.497 --> 42:52.817
- Not gonna take that.
- That's fine, yes, we'll take that.

43:24.914 --> 43:26.350
What's that mean?
