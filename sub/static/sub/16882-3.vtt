WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.004
(birds chirping, dog barking)

00:07.708 --> 00:11.245
(snoring)

00:41.275 --> 00:43.043
>> MAN: Let's go.

00:51.285 --> 00:54.222
>> * I'm gonna leave you anyway

00:54.255 --> 00:56.724
I'm gonna leave you anyway

00:56.757 --> 00:59.093
Gonna leave you anyway. *

01:04.265 --> 01:05.933
(water running)

01:05.966 --> 01:07.101
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, I love your

01:07.135 --> 01:08.636
shower.

01:08.669 --> 01:09.937
>> JIMMY: Yeah, it's a good one.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.372
>> GRETCHEN: Me and this hand

01:11.405 --> 01:12.606
nozzle thingy have gotten very

01:12.640 --> 01:14.208
close.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.443
You're S.O.L., but trust me,

01:15.476 --> 01:17.077
it's amazing.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.446
>> JIMMY: Oh, I use it.

01:18.479 --> 01:19.747
>> GRETCHEN: How?

01:19.780 --> 01:21.048
>> JIMMY: I shoot it up my butt.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.416
>> GRETCHEN: You do?

01:22.450 --> 01:23.817
>> JIMMY: Sure.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.886
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, yeah!

01:25.919 --> 01:28.256
What do you know?

01:31.992 --> 01:33.261
(grunts)

01:33.294 --> 01:35.763
(clears throat)

01:35.796 --> 01:37.565
>> JIMMY: What?

01:37.598 --> 01:38.799
>> GRETCHEN: You missed a step

01:38.832 --> 01:40.434
in that process.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.669
>> JIMMY: Oh, no, it's just pee.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.337
Look.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.005
>> GRETCHEN: You-you sit to pee?

01:45.038 --> 01:46.073
>> JIMMY: Yeah, I sit whenever

01:46.106 --> 01:47.074
I can.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.075
I love sitting.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.577
Sitting's definitely in my top

01:49.610 --> 01:50.678
five favorite activities.

01:50.711 --> 01:51.679
>> GRETCHEN: What are the

01:51.712 --> 01:52.680
others?

01:52.713 --> 01:53.981
>> JIMMY: Eating things.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.115
Shutting stupid people down

01:55.149 --> 01:56.317
verbally.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.651
Bubble baths.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.019
Masturbating.

01:59.052 --> 02:00.020
>> GRETCHEN: Where's sex?

02:00.053 --> 02:01.021
>> JIMMY: Eighth probably.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.022
>> GRETCHEN: What about sex

02:02.055 --> 02:03.023
with me?

02:03.056 --> 02:04.024
>> JIMMY: Seventh, maybe sixth.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.159
Yeah, no, sex with you, then

02:05.193 --> 02:06.627
sleeping.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.861
Unless I have a flying dream.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.764
Then you're seventh.

02:10.798 --> 02:11.799
(clears throat)

02:11.832 --> 02:12.800
>> GRETCHEN: What's your day

02:12.833 --> 02:13.801
like?

02:13.834 --> 02:14.968
>> JIMMY: Oh, you know, tedious

02:15.002 --> 02:17.004
interactions with awful people.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.506
>> GRETCHEN: Weird. Mine, too.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.773
When are you gonna be home?

02:19.807 --> 02:20.774
My clothes from last night are

02:20.808 --> 02:21.975
still in your dryer.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.877
>> JIMMY: On the late side.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.145
>> GRETCHEN: Want to give me a

02:25.179 --> 02:28.982
key so I can get in?

02:29.016 --> 02:30.851
Jimmy?

02:30.884 --> 02:32.320
You using the hand thingy?

02:32.353 --> 02:34.655
>> JIMMY: Edgar can let you in.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.689
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, but in case

02:35.723 --> 02:38.091
he's not home.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.896
Hey...

02:42.930 --> 02:44.164
Hey!

02:44.198 --> 02:45.699
I-I just meant a key to get my

02:45.733 --> 02:46.967
stuff; I didn't mean a key

02:47.000 --> 02:48.202
like... like that.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.203
>> JIMMY: Okay.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.371
>> GRETCHEN: I didn't.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.372
>> JIMMY: Okay.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.373
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.708
Good.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.244
But, I mean...

02:56.277 --> 02:58.045
>> JIMMY: God's sake!

02:58.078 --> 03:00.047
(huffs)

03:03.083 --> 03:04.084
>> GRETCHEN: Seriously, what if

03:04.117 --> 03:05.085
I had-- would that be any reason

03:05.118 --> 03:06.220
to shit yourself?

03:06.254 --> 03:07.655
>> JIMMY: Yes.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.656
>> GRETCHEN: We've spent the

03:08.689 --> 03:10.190
last five, six nights in a row

03:10.224 --> 03:11.225
together?

03:11.259 --> 03:12.260
>> JIMMY: 'Cause you fall asleep

03:12.293 --> 03:13.561
after sex!

03:13.594 --> 03:14.928
You're like a fat guy in an

03:14.962 --> 03:16.430
American sitcom.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.431
>> GRETCHEN: It's a key.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.566
It's a way to get in.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.534
>> JIMMY: No, it's not.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.869
It's...

03:21.902 --> 03:24.171
it's my freedom melted down into

03:24.204 --> 03:26.206
a metal totem.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.841
It means that there are rights

03:27.875 --> 03:31.011
granted and designations...

03:31.044 --> 03:32.613
designated.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.214
>> GRETCHEN: No, it doesn't.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.716
It's a...

03:35.749 --> 03:38.619
Oh, my God, you're right.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.454
>> JIMMY: I am?

03:40.488 --> 03:42.089
>> GRETCHEN: I must still be

03:42.122 --> 03:43.391
hungover.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.692
Thanks for calling me out.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.193
Momentary lapse of sanity.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.261
Jesus.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.729
>> JIMMY: Right, so, uh... are

03:48.762 --> 03:50.063
we gonna hang out later or...?

03:50.097 --> 03:51.064
>> GRETCHEN: I actually have

03:51.098 --> 03:52.199
plans.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.801
>> JIMMY: Okay.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.035
>> GRETCHEN: Well, as my grandma

03:55.068 --> 03:56.537
used to say, "It's only a walk

03:56.570 --> 03:57.605
of shame if you're capable of

03:57.638 --> 03:58.806
feeling shame."

03:58.839 --> 03:59.807
See you later.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.808
Thanks for doing all the sex

04:00.841 --> 04:03.243
stuff on me.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.755
(whistling)

04:19.493 --> 04:20.461
>> EDGAR: That's a frittata.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.462
>> JIMMY: Mm-hmm.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.463
>> EDGAR: It's an egg-based

04:22.496 --> 04:23.464
dish similar to an omelet.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.465
>> JIMMY: I know what a frittata

04:24.498 --> 04:25.466
is.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.467
>> EDGAR: This one has leeks and

04:26.500 --> 04:27.468
goat cheese.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.469
I saw the recipe on Rachael Ray.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.470
>> JIMMY: You're not supposed to

04:29.503 --> 04:30.838
watch her.

04:30.871 --> 04:31.839
The doctor said that your

04:31.872 --> 04:33.607
obsession with her is unhealthy.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.608
>> EDGAR: I know, but every

04:34.642 --> 04:35.743
minute that I'm watching her,

04:35.776 --> 04:37.144
I'm not doing heroin.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.145
Except sometimes I'm also

04:38.178 --> 04:39.146
doing heroin.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.147
>> JIMMY: You know, she asked

04:40.180 --> 04:41.148
for a key.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.149
>> EDGAR: Who?

04:42.182 --> 04:43.150
>> JIMMY: Rachael Ray.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.151
Who do you think?

04:44.184 --> 04:45.152
>> EDGAR: Rachael Ray could have

04:45.185 --> 04:46.153
a key.

04:46.186 --> 04:47.154
>> JIMMY: Can you believe she

04:47.187 --> 04:48.155
would do that?

04:48.188 --> 04:49.156
>> EDGAR: Well, I mean, keys

04:49.189 --> 04:50.157
open doors.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.158
>> JIMMY: It's not a key.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.159
It's a symbol.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.160
>> EDGAR: Of what?

04:53.193 --> 04:54.161
>> JIMMY: Of the unceasing,

04:54.194 --> 04:55.295
inexorable march of everything

04:55.329 --> 04:57.197
towards predictability,

04:57.230 --> 04:59.299
blandness and mediocrity.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.501
It's the Rachael Raying of the

05:00.534 --> 05:01.502
world.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.503
>> EDGAR: A cozy world full of

05:02.536 --> 05:03.504
home-cooked meals and graceful

05:03.537 --> 05:04.938
weight fluctuation?

05:04.972 --> 05:06.874
I'd live in that world.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.275
>> JIMMY: I honestly cannot sit

05:08.308 --> 05:09.543
there and pretend not to be

05:09.577 --> 05:11.379
horrified by things as

05:11.412 --> 05:13.547
unthought-out and unspecial as

05:13.581 --> 05:15.483
"Can I have a key," ruled by

05:15.516 --> 05:17.284
nothing more interesting than

05:17.317 --> 05:18.952
animal instinct to the point

05:18.986 --> 05:19.953
that I might as well be

05:19.987 --> 05:21.555
sleeping with a migratory bird

05:21.589 --> 05:23.391
or a leatherback sea turtle.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.392
>> EDGAR: I'm gonna eat your

05:24.425 --> 05:25.393
frittata.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.694
>> JIMMY: "Can I have a key?"

05:26.727 --> 05:28.729
I'll tell you what...

05:28.762 --> 05:30.230
How can you see this shit

05:30.263 --> 05:31.732
happening and just smile and be

05:31.765 --> 05:33.300
okay with it?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.502
How do you look at the person

05:34.535 --> 05:35.636
you're with and not just know

05:35.669 --> 05:37.705
that there's another person

05:37.738 --> 05:41.074
inside who's boring and lame

05:41.108 --> 05:42.342
and will eventually ask for

05:42.376 --> 05:44.745
emotional support and to shop

05:44.778 --> 05:46.880
together for decorative sconces

05:46.914 --> 05:48.582
at Williams-Sonoma.

05:48.616 --> 05:49.650
How can you just ignore

05:49.683 --> 05:51.385
that shit?

05:51.419 --> 05:52.753
>> EDGAR: I don't know.

05:52.786 --> 05:56.657
Because you like them, I guess.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.526
>> JIMMY: Yeah, well...

05:58.559 --> 06:00.327
I don't know how to do that,

06:00.360 --> 06:02.696
so...

06:05.799 --> 06:07.568
>> EDGAR: Well, it makes sense

06:07.601 --> 06:09.036
she'd be emotional today.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.037
>> JIMMY: I swear, if you're

06:10.070 --> 06:11.439
charting her menstrual cycle...

06:11.472 --> 06:12.706
>> EDGAR: It's her birthday.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.874
>> JIMMY: It is?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.275
>> EDGAR: Mm-hmm.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.276
>> JIMMY: Why didn't she tell

06:16.309 --> 06:17.377
me?

06:17.411 --> 06:19.747
(cell phone buzzing)

06:22.483 --> 06:24.217
Oh, it's Gretchen's.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.253
I better bring it to her.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.254
>> EDGAR: Hand it over.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.288
>> JIMMY: What?

06:28.321 --> 06:29.623
I'm not gonna snoop.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.192
I'm not!

06:32.225 --> 06:36.063
Aw...

06:36.096 --> 06:38.766
Aw, this is stupid.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.968
Y-You are stupid.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.269
I'm living with the stupidest

06:42.302 --> 06:43.471
person in America.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.305
Me, the smartest, and you, the

06:45.338 --> 06:49.209
stupidest, living together.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.243
You seriously think I'm not

06:50.277 --> 06:51.378
strong enough to break through

06:51.411 --> 06:53.747
what-- ten staples?

06:56.249 --> 06:57.551
>> EDGAR: Have a good day at

06:57.585 --> 06:59.953
school.

07:02.790 --> 07:03.957
>> GRETCHEN: You've got to be

07:03.991 --> 07:05.158
kidding me.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.393
You're doing a juice cleanse?

07:06.426 --> 07:07.561
You disgusting cliché.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.762
You're going to embarrass me at

07:08.796 --> 07:09.963
my diner.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.164
>> LINDSAY: Don't care.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.399
Day five.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.567
Gretch, you can't imagine the

07:13.601 --> 07:14.768
high.

07:14.802 --> 07:15.969
>> GRETCHEN: Mmm, bet I can.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.170
>> LINDSAY: No, you can't.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.105
>> GRETCHEN: Remember the time

07:18.138 --> 07:19.072
you and Chingy snorted K off

07:19.106 --> 07:19.840
my vag?

07:19.873 --> 07:21.575
>> LINDSAY: Aw... yeah.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.911
This one is almond, flaxseed and

07:23.944 --> 07:26.079
something called "whey runoff."

07:26.113 --> 07:29.282
>> GRETCHEN: Mmm. Mmm.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.484
Mmm.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.685
>> LINDSAY: You don't understand

07:31.719 --> 07:32.920
how skinny the wives at Paul's

07:32.953 --> 07:34.121
firm are, Gretch.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.288
I can't compete.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.490
>> GRETCHEN: So, don't try.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.691
Those Westside women are all

07:37.725 --> 07:38.926
overly-tanned garbage monsters

07:38.959 --> 07:40.494
with fake tits.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.995
Hip bones jutting out of their

07:42.029 --> 07:43.196
Lululemons.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.431
>> LINDSAY: That's exactly what

07:44.464 --> 07:45.265
they are.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.800
>> GRETCHEN: So screw 'em.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.001
Screw 'em, divorce Paul, start

07:48.035 --> 07:49.202
eating food, move back to the

07:49.236 --> 07:50.437
East Side, become goddamn

07:50.470 --> 07:51.605
interesting again.

07:51.639 --> 07:52.806
>> LINDSAY: Wow.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.007
If it wasn't your birthday, I'd

07:54.041 --> 07:55.208
be really hurt.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.443
>> GRETCHEN: Sorry.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.611
This Jimmy thing has me all

07:57.645 --> 07:58.812
freaked out.

07:58.846 --> 07:59.813
>> LINDSAY: I warned you about

07:59.847 --> 08:01.014
him.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.015
I bet you guys talk about me all

08:02.049 --> 08:03.016
the time, huh?

08:03.050 --> 08:04.017
How much it bugs me.

08:04.051 --> 08:04.985
>> GRETCHEN: Nope.

08:05.018 --> 08:05.986
>> LINDSAY: Ew! You guys

08:06.019 --> 08:06.987
probably, like, talk about me

08:07.020 --> 08:07.988
during sex even.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.623
You guys are weird.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.624
>> GRETCHEN: I didn't mean the

08:10.658 --> 08:12.225
key thing like he took it.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.460
I don't think I did.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.562
We're having fun.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.796
That's enough.

08:15.829 --> 08:16.997
>> LINDSAY: It better be.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.198
He is a bad person.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.399
>> GRETCHEN: I'm a bad person.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.400
>> LINDSAY: Ooh, are you still

08:20.433 --> 08:21.401
seeing Mr. Fancy Director Guy?

08:21.434 --> 08:22.402
>> GRETCHEN: It's complicated.

08:22.435 --> 08:23.403
>> LINDSAY: Your life is so fun

08:23.436 --> 08:24.572
and complicated!

08:24.605 --> 08:26.740
My life used to be fun and

08:26.774 --> 08:27.741
complicated.

08:27.775 --> 08:28.742
>> GRETCHEN: And now you're

08:28.776 --> 08:29.743
married to a banker.

08:29.777 --> 08:30.744
>> LINDSAY: Paul is actually

08:30.778 --> 08:31.745
VP...

08:31.779 --> 08:32.746
>> GRETCHEN: Oh.

08:32.780 --> 08:33.747
>> LINDSAY: ...of Wealth

08:33.781 --> 08:34.748
Management and Investment

08:34.782 --> 08:35.749
Strategies.

08:35.783 --> 08:36.750
(Gretchen snores)

08:36.784 --> 08:37.384
Idiot.

08:37.417 --> 08:38.218
>> GRETCHEN: What?

08:38.251 --> 08:39.219
>> BRIANNA: There you are.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.220
I'm sorry, Gretchen.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.221
Uh, your phone keeps going to

08:41.254 --> 08:42.222
voice mail.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.190
>> GRETCHEN:: Oh, I left it

08:43.223 --> 08:44.191
somewhere. What's up?

08:44.224 --> 08:45.192
>> BRIANNA: It's Sam.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.193
He did an interview.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.194
>> GRETCHEN: Without consulting

08:47.227 --> 08:48.195
me? Who with?

08:48.228 --> 08:49.196
>> BRIANNA: A college paper.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.664
>> GRETCHEN: Oh. And?

08:50.698 --> 08:51.665
>> BRIANNA: He used the word

08:51.699 --> 08:52.833
"gay" and "faggot" 37 times.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.001
>> GRETCHEN: As in "faggot is a

08:54.034 --> 08:55.202
really terrible word, and gay

08:55.235 --> 08:56.403
people are the best"?

08:56.436 --> 08:57.605
>> BRIANNA: The reporter is the

08:57.638 --> 08:58.772
president of the Gay and Lesbian

08:58.806 --> 09:00.007
student union, and he's

09:00.040 --> 09:01.675
threatening to go to the Times.

09:01.709 --> 09:02.876
>> LINDSAY: Go.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.077
Breakfast is on me.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.278
Happy birthday.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.513
>> GRETCHEN: Nice try.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.681
You still have to buy me a

09:07.715 --> 09:11.284
present... cheapskate.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.895
>> LINDSAY: Mmm.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.932
(engine revving)

09:24.965 --> 09:26.600
(opera plays on stereo)

09:26.634 --> 09:29.737
(phone chimes)

09:29.770 --> 09:32.740
(phone buzzes, phone chimes)

09:32.773 --> 09:34.107
(buzzing)

09:34.141 --> 09:35.609
(man singing opera in Italian

09:35.643 --> 09:38.311
on stereo)

09:38.345 --> 09:40.748
(Jimmy sings along in Italian)

09:40.781 --> 09:42.750
(phone chimes)

09:42.783 --> 09:45.819
(Jimmy sings along)

09:45.853 --> 09:47.087
>> JIMMY: * La-la-la, la-la-la,

09:47.120 --> 09:48.922
la, la... *

09:48.956 --> 09:51.158
(grunting)

09:51.191 --> 09:53.661
Oh, come on!

10:02.469 --> 10:04.137
(phone buzzes)

10:05.438 --> 10:07.374
(phone buzzes)

10:09.276 --> 10:11.411
(phone buzzes)

10:11.444 --> 10:13.781
(phone chimes)

10:18.018 --> 10:20.153
>> JIMMY: Who the hell is Ty?!

10:29.496 --> 10:31.531
>> SAM: I stole you a card from

10:31.564 --> 10:33.300
CVS, but I lost it on the way

10:33.333 --> 10:34.467
over here.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.669
>> GRETCHEN: This is serious,

10:35.703 --> 10:36.870
Sam.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.105
>> SAM: Inside, it said, "You're

10:38.138 --> 10:39.306
not just getting older.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.507
You're also getting less

10:40.540 --> 10:41.341
attractive."

10:41.374 --> 10:42.342
>> GRETCHEN: You can't bribe me

10:42.375 --> 10:43.343
with flowers.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.344
>> HONEY NUTZ: It's a joke,

10:44.377 --> 10:45.345
because you're so young and

10:45.378 --> 10:46.346
beautiful and shit.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.347
>> GRETCHEN: What were you

10:47.380 --> 10:48.348
thinking, doing an interview

10:48.381 --> 10:49.516
without me there?

10:49.549 --> 10:50.517
To quote you, "I get nervous

10:50.550 --> 10:51.719
at these shits."

10:51.752 --> 10:52.720
>> SAM: We were skating and

10:52.753 --> 10:53.721
messing with college girls, and

10:53.754 --> 10:54.955
this skinny fool comes up and

10:54.988 --> 10:56.523
says, can he ask some questions.

10:56.556 --> 10:57.725
>> GRETCHEN: Were you high?

10:57.758 --> 10:58.959
>> SAM: It was 10:00 in the

10:58.992 --> 11:00.160
morning.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.361
Of course I was high.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.362
>> GRETCHEN: And the whole time,

11:02.395 --> 11:03.530
you did not notice he was gay?

11:03.563 --> 11:04.732
Presumptively.

11:04.765 --> 11:05.966
>> SAM: Yeah, I mean, dude was

11:05.999 --> 11:07.801
hella fruity, but so what?

11:07.835 --> 11:09.336
My generation-- we don't act

11:09.369 --> 11:10.971
different around different

11:11.004 --> 11:13.173
people, frontin' fake

11:13.206 --> 11:14.374
personalities.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.809
We cool with everybody.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.010
Except Shitstain.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.211
He don't like Koreans.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.412
>> SHITSTAIN: 'Cause of their

11:19.446 --> 11:20.580
manipulative currency

11:20.613 --> 11:21.815
devaluation.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.016
And they eyes.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.084
>> GRETCHEN: You called the head

11:24.117 --> 11:25.218
of the LGBT student union a

11:25.252 --> 11:26.419
"faggot."

11:26.453 --> 11:27.587
>> SAM: So? I call my pops that

11:27.620 --> 11:28.822
all the time.

11:28.856 --> 11:29.990
>> GRETCHEN: Is your dad gay?

11:30.023 --> 11:30.991
>> SAM: No. He's just a faggot.

11:31.024 --> 11:31.992
>> GRETCHEN: Well, now I have to

11:32.025 --> 11:32.993
go down there and deal with

11:33.026 --> 11:34.194
this.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.195
>> SAM: And do your job?

11:35.228 --> 11:36.396
Oh, no, Gretchen.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.564
>> GRETCHEN: From now on, when

11:37.597 --> 11:38.565
you receive an interview

11:38.598 --> 11:39.767
request, spontaneous or

11:39.800 --> 11:41.001
otherwise, what are you gonna

11:41.034 --> 11:44.204
do?

11:44.237 --> 11:45.205
>> HONEY NUTZ: Politely direct

11:45.238 --> 11:46.840
'em to your office?

11:46.874 --> 11:48.241
>> GRETCHEN: Damn straight.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.277
Listen to Honey Nutz.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.279
(Sam sighs)

11:54.314 --> 11:55.382
>> JIMMY: Damn it.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.550
>> GRETCHEN: Hey.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.620
>> JIMMY: Hey.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.089
Uh, I brought your phone.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.290
>> GRETCHEN: Oh. Awesome.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.524
Thanks.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.692
(Jimmy sputters, sighs)

12:05.725 --> 12:06.693
>> JIMMY: Beep, beep.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.694
(clears throat)

12:07.727 --> 12:08.695
Oh, you got flowers.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.696
>> GRETCHEN: Oh. Yeah.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.697
>> JIMMY: Buy them yourself

12:10.730 --> 12:11.698
or...?

12:11.731 --> 12:12.766
>> GRETCHEN: No.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.768
>> JIMMY: Ah.

12:16.804 --> 12:17.771
Special occasion of some sort?

12:17.805 --> 12:18.972
>> GRETCHEN: People send me

12:19.006 --> 12:20.207
flowers sometimes, Jimmy.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.408
They want to see me happy.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.609
People like me.

12:22.642 --> 12:23.811
>> JIMMY: Oh, I know that.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.045
Of course I know that.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.480
So, what are you doing later?

12:27.514 --> 12:28.882
>> GRETCHEN: I have plans.

12:28.916 --> 12:29.883
>> JIMMY: Fine! Bye.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.852
(clears throat, sniffles)

12:34.354 --> 12:35.923
>> SAM: Hey, can I get one of

12:35.956 --> 12:37.124
those?

12:37.157 --> 12:38.325
>> JIMMY: These are pretty

12:38.358 --> 12:39.326
expensive.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.261
>> SAM: Don't be an asshole.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.796
>> JIMMY: Fine.

12:42.830 --> 12:43.997
>> SAM: You're boning my

12:44.031 --> 12:46.633
publicist, right?

12:46.666 --> 12:47.835
>> JIMMY: Used to be.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.069
>> SAM: Yeah, I Googled your

12:49.102 --> 12:50.237
ass.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.438
I liked your book.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.639
>> JIMMY: Really?

12:52.672 --> 12:53.841
Thank you.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.475
What did you like about it?

12:55.508 --> 12:56.676
>> SAM: Obviously, I thought it

12:56.709 --> 12:58.145
was, like, boring as shit.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.612
And clearly, you used to jack

12:59.646 --> 13:01.514
off to Hemingway in high school,

13:01.548 --> 13:02.816
but the prose was good.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.017
>> JIMMY: Thank you.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.585
Enjoy your smoke.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.154
>> SAM: Why'd you used to be

13:07.187 --> 13:08.355
boning her?

13:08.388 --> 13:09.522
>> JIMMY: I don't know.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.992
We were never a real thing.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.193
>> SAM: How come?

13:13.226 --> 13:15.295
All I know is, I don't let

13:15.328 --> 13:17.130
nobody talk to me the way

13:17.164 --> 13:18.331
Gretch does.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.499
>> JIMMY: Yeah, me, neither.

13:19.532 --> 13:20.968
>> SAM: Figure she must be

13:21.001 --> 13:22.202
pretty dope if we both let her

13:22.235 --> 13:23.436
do that.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.605
(Jimmy sighs)

13:25.638 --> 13:27.140
>> JIMMY: Are you going back in?

13:27.174 --> 13:29.877
>> SAM: Yeah.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.512
>> JIMMY: Give her this for me.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.051
Hey, do you know someone

13:38.085 --> 13:40.053
named Ty?

13:51.231 --> 13:52.399
>> DARREN: Then I was like,

13:52.432 --> 13:53.566
"Girl, fix your weave."

13:53.600 --> 13:54.801
>> GRETCHEN: Darren Kaplan?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.003
>> DARREN: Yeah?

13:56.036 --> 13:57.004
>> GRETCHEN: I wanted to talk to

13:57.037 --> 13:58.005
you about Sam Halton.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.572
Maker's, rocks.

13:59.606 --> 14:00.807
>> DARREN: When you went into

14:00.840 --> 14:02.009
PR, were you aware that you'd

14:02.042 --> 14:03.710
become an instant cliché?

14:03.743 --> 14:05.045
>> GRETCHEN: Snotty gay reporter

14:05.078 --> 14:06.046
is better?

14:06.079 --> 14:07.915
(guys chuckle)

14:07.948 --> 14:10.583
>> DARREN: Shoo.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.584
What do you want?

14:11.618 --> 14:12.585
>> GRETCHEN: I just want to make

14:12.619 --> 14:13.686
sure my client's words aren't

14:13.720 --> 14:14.687
taken out of context.

14:14.721 --> 14:15.688
>> DARREN: Don't worry.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.257
I'll provide lots of context.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.658
>> GRETCHEN: He's a moron.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.659
He's not even old enough to

14:19.692 --> 14:20.660
drink.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.661
His opinions aren't fully

14:21.694 --> 14:22.662
formed.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.663
>> DARREN: We're on the dawn of

14:23.696 --> 14:24.831
a revolution.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.533
You wouldn't run around saying

14:26.566 --> 14:27.534
the "N" word, but people feel

14:27.567 --> 14:28.535
free to say "fag" whenever

14:28.568 --> 14:29.536
they want.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.537
>> GRETCHEN: He says the

14:30.570 --> 14:31.871
"N" word all the time, too.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.173
He called wheatgrass the

14:33.206 --> 14:34.241
"N" word yesterday.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.043
He was like, "Mmm, this 'N' word

14:36.076 --> 14:39.012
is... hella good for digestion."

14:39.046 --> 14:40.013
>> DARREN: You got anything

14:40.047 --> 14:41.014
else?

14:41.048 --> 14:42.015
>> GRETCHEN: No.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.450
It's my birthday.

14:43.483 --> 14:47.087
I didn't really prepare.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.088
This is the point where I would

14:48.121 --> 14:51.891
normally try flirting with you.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.793
Okay, I tried.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.695
>> DARREN: Wait, that's it?

14:55.728 --> 14:56.763
>> GRETCHEN: Look, I love my

14:56.796 --> 14:57.931
client like the black son I

14:57.965 --> 14:58.932
aborted in high school, but

14:58.966 --> 15:00.133
maybe you're right.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.368
Banning words is always the

15:01.401 --> 15:02.569
misguided byproduct of good

15:02.602 --> 15:03.636
social movements.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.272
So, maybe his career is worth

15:05.305 --> 15:06.639
the sacrifice.

15:06.673 --> 15:07.640
>> DARREN: I heard Caliber had

15:07.674 --> 15:08.641
a big hush budget.

15:08.675 --> 15:09.642
>> GRETCHEN: I can give you

15:09.676 --> 15:10.643
two grand-- that's it.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.644
>> DARREN: And he has to come

15:11.678 --> 15:12.645
give me another interview.

15:12.679 --> 15:13.646
>> GRETCHEN: Done.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.647
>> DARREN: Happy birthday.

15:14.681 --> 15:15.648
>> GRETCHEN: Thanks.

15:15.682 --> 15:16.649
Congrats on choosing a

15:16.683 --> 15:18.651
dying profession.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.002
>> JIMMY: She can do whatever

15:35.035 --> 15:36.003
she wants.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.604
Just go home.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.006
Or go in there and ruin

15:39.039 --> 15:41.341
her date.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.343
Yep.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.015
>> LINDSAY: Oh!

15:48.048 --> 15:49.016
Farts.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.083
>> JIMMY: Sorry.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.318
Lindsay, what...

15:51.351 --> 15:52.419
>> BECCA: I'm saying, like, you

15:52.452 --> 15:53.420
can tell, like, she just stuffed

15:53.453 --> 15:54.421
it into a bag.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.422
You know what I mean?

15:55.455 --> 15:56.756
It's so sad.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.991
>> LINDSAY: Hey, Jimmy, how's

15:58.025 --> 15:59.692
it going?

15:59.726 --> 16:01.128
>> PAUL: Here, honey, oh.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.262
>> LINDSAY: Just...

16:02.295 --> 16:03.663
>> PAUL: Hey, Jimmy.

16:03.696 --> 16:04.664
Nice to see you.

16:04.697 --> 16:05.665
>> JIMMY: Do you work here?

16:05.698 --> 16:06.666
Can I get a double whiskey,

16:06.699 --> 16:08.201
neat?

16:08.235 --> 16:10.270
>> PAUL: Jimmy, it's Paul,

16:10.303 --> 16:11.804
Lindsay's husband?

16:11.838 --> 16:12.805
We vacationed in Saint Lucia

16:12.839 --> 16:13.806
together.

16:13.840 --> 16:14.807
Twice.

16:14.841 --> 16:15.808
>> LINDSAY: Just get him the

16:15.842 --> 16:16.943
whiskey, Paul.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.179
Go.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.780
I lost eight pounds since you

16:20.813 --> 16:22.215
saw me last.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.051
Can you tell?

16:24.084 --> 16:26.186
>> JIMMY: No.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.187
>> GRETCHEN: So, this is creepy.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.188
>> JIMMY: I know.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.189
How could you not invite me to

16:29.222 --> 16:30.190
your birthday drinks?

16:30.223 --> 16:31.191
>> GRETCHEN: I mean you just

16:31.224 --> 16:32.192
showing up.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.193
>> JIMMY: Oh, I thought you were

16:33.226 --> 16:34.194
on a date.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.828
>> GRETCHEN: How is that better?

16:35.862 --> 16:36.829
Why'd you think I was on a date?

16:36.863 --> 16:37.830
>> JIMMY: Well, a text came

16:37.864 --> 16:38.831
through on your phone.

16:38.865 --> 16:39.832
>> GRETCHEN: You snooped?

16:39.866 --> 16:41.168
>> JIMMY: No, I... I couldn't

16:41.201 --> 16:42.902
figure out your password, so...

16:42.935 --> 16:43.903
>> GRETCHEN: What are we doing,

16:43.936 --> 16:45.905
Jimmy?

16:50.210 --> 16:51.411
>> TY: Happy birthday, you.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.012
It's from a winery in La Cañada

16:53.046 --> 16:55.648
I'm a partial investor of.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.217
>> JIMMY: Oh, where the 2 meets

16:57.250 --> 16:58.585
the 210.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.586
Yeah, they say it's our

16:59.619 --> 17:01.688
Rhône Valley.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.190
>> GRETCHEN: Thanks, Ty.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.491
>> TY: Uh, Gretchen, this is

17:04.524 --> 17:05.492
Element.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.026
>> GRETCHEN: LMN?

17:07.060 --> 17:08.061
>> ELEMENT: Element.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.929
Like oxygen, hydrogen.

17:09.962 --> 17:13.866
>> JIMMY: Arsenic, radon.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.268
>> TY: Ty Wyland.

17:15.302 --> 17:17.070
>> JIMMY: Sorry, Twine what?

17:17.104 --> 17:18.071
>> TY: Ty Wyland.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.239
>> JIMMY (whispering): I don't

17:19.272 --> 17:21.908
understand what he's saying.

17:21.941 --> 17:22.909
>> GRETCHEN: Uh, grab yourselves

17:22.942 --> 17:24.077
drinks.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.078
We're right over there.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.379
>> TY: We actually can't stay.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.747
Uh, we have a fund-raiser for

17:27.780 --> 17:29.116
this very promising Guatemalan

17:29.149 --> 17:30.117
reform candidate.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.251
>> JIMMY: Ooh, heavily into

17:31.284 --> 17:32.719
Central American politics, are

17:32.752 --> 17:35.722
you, Element?

17:35.755 --> 17:36.723
>> TY: Well.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.926
Happy birthday, again.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.028
(whispers): I need to see you.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.797
Soon.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.434
Nice to see you guys.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.436
Okay.

17:52.839 --> 17:53.806
>> JIMMY: So that's why you

17:53.840 --> 17:54.807
didn't invite me.

17:54.841 --> 17:55.808
>> GRETCHEN: Also, I wanted to

17:55.842 --> 17:57.144
spare you Becca and Vernon.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.578
>> VERNON: Homeslice!

17:58.611 --> 18:00.447
Get your balls over here.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.249
What? It's Jimmy.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.250
>> JIMMY: You could have just

18:03.283 --> 18:04.884
told me it was your birthday and

18:04.917 --> 18:06.419
you were hanging with...

18:06.453 --> 18:07.920
friends.

18:07.954 --> 18:08.921
I wouldn't have come.

18:08.955 --> 18:09.922
>> GRETCHEN: It's not my fault

18:09.956 --> 18:11.558
my birthday came two weeks after

18:11.591 --> 18:12.559
we started... whatever we're

18:12.592 --> 18:13.560
doing.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.561
>> JIMMY: You thought he was

18:14.594 --> 18:15.562
coming alone.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.563
>> GRETCHEN: I didn't ask

18:16.596 --> 18:17.730
for any of this to happen,

18:17.764 --> 18:20.267
in this order.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.334
>> JIMMY: You didn't do anything

18:21.368 --> 18:22.402
wrong.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.604
Okay?

18:24.637 --> 18:26.339
Look, I'm gonna go, okay?

18:26.373 --> 18:27.507
>> GRETCHEN: No, stay.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.508
>> JIMMY: What, now that he's

18:28.541 --> 18:29.509
gone?

18:29.542 --> 18:30.743
>> GRETCHEN: Don't be a dick.

18:30.777 --> 18:31.744
>> JIMMY: Fine.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.313
But if I'm in danger of getting

18:33.346 --> 18:35.482
into conversation with anyone

18:35.515 --> 18:38.351
really annoying, just kick me

18:38.385 --> 18:39.519
under the table.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.521
>> GRETCHEN: Deal.

18:45.725 --> 18:46.693
Hey, guys.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.127
This is Jimmy.

18:48.161 --> 18:51.698
He's a... guy I'm sleeping with.

18:56.002 --> 18:56.969
>> LINDSAY: Jimmy.

18:57.003 --> 18:57.970
Sit next to me.

18:58.004 --> 18:58.971
Paul, can you get me a backup

18:59.005 --> 19:00.507
drink?

19:00.540 --> 19:02.509
Go.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.113
>> EDGAR: She asked me not to

19:07.146 --> 19:08.114
tell you.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.115
>> JIMMY: You're not my friend

19:09.148 --> 19:10.116
anymore.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.117
>> EDGAR: Can I still live with

19:11.150 --> 19:12.118
you rent-free?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.119
>> JIMMY: I guess so, yeah.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.120
>> EDGAR: It was good to see

19:14.153 --> 19:15.322
you.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.956
>> JIMMY: Um... hey, guys.

19:16.989 --> 19:17.957
>> VERNON: Nice pull.

19:17.990 --> 19:18.958
Bec didn't tell me you were

19:18.991 --> 19:19.959
hitting that.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.361
>> BECCA: Because I had no idea.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.562
>> VERNON: Jimmy, you got to see

19:22.595 --> 19:23.563
this photo my colorectal guy

19:23.596 --> 19:24.564
just texted.

19:24.597 --> 19:25.565
It's sick.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.566
>> JIMMY: No.

19:26.599 --> 19:27.567
Aw!

19:27.600 --> 19:28.568
>> BECCA: Just...

19:28.601 --> 19:29.669
>> VERNON: Your loss.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.504
I'm getting us Jägerbombsters.

19:31.538 --> 19:32.505
>> BECCA: Ugh.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.073
>> VERNON: Jägerbombsters!

19:34.106 --> 19:35.208
>> BECCA: Did it even occur to

19:35.242 --> 19:36.376
you to tell me that you're

19:36.409 --> 19:39.011
sleeping with Gretchen?

19:39.045 --> 19:40.012
>> JIMMY: No.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.013
>> BECCA: You and Gretchen are

19:41.047 --> 19:42.549
poison people.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.517
This is going to end so badly.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.652
>> JIMMY: I know, right?

19:45.685 --> 19:48.521
(laughs, sighs)

19:56.529 --> 19:57.497
>> GRETCHEN: I'm glad you came

19:57.530 --> 19:58.498
tonight.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.932
>> JIMMY: Stop.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.334
>> GRETCHEN: Tough shit.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.502
I am.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.036
You are growing on me,

20:04.070 --> 20:05.772
Jimmy... Stupid-Three-Names.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.440
>> JIMMY: You're drunk.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.441
Thanks.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.176
Ditto.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.211
There is no way that that model

20:12.245 --> 20:14.046
is as good in bed as you are.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.882
>> GRETCHEN: I know, right?

20:15.915 --> 20:17.717
Okay, that's weird.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.286
Sorry about the key thing.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.287
>> JIMMY: Oh, yeah, speaking of

20:20.320 --> 20:21.288
which, I should probably take

20:21.321 --> 20:22.289
back the one I gave Sam.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.290
That was my main key.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.124
>> GRETCHEN: You gave Sam a key?

20:25.157 --> 20:26.626
>> JIMMY: To give to you, yeah.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.428
>> GRETCHEN: Wait, so you wanted

20:28.461 --> 20:29.796
me to have a key?

20:29.829 --> 20:31.531
>> JIMMY: No, I just didn't want

20:31.564 --> 20:32.932
you to be mad at me.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.066
>> GRETCHEN: I'm not.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.536
I'm just embarrassed for asking.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.738
>> JIMMY: Okay, good.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.407
Wait, he never gave you the key?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.775
>> GRETCHEN: No.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.777
(rattles door handle)

20:48.348 --> 20:50.283
>> SAM: Oh, shit.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.284
Hey, guys.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.285
>> JIMMY: What the hell are

20:52.319 --> 20:53.286
you doing?

20:53.320 --> 20:54.287
>> SAM: Sorry.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.788
We needed a place.

20:55.822 --> 20:58.425
>> GRETCHEN: For what?

20:58.458 --> 20:59.426
>> DARREN: Hey.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.460
>> GRETCHEN: You're gay?

21:00.493 --> 21:02.462
>> SAM: No... but this nigga

21:02.495 --> 21:06.499
sucks really good dick.
