00:34.909 --> 00:39.250
<i>I was bruised and battered
I couldn't tell what I felt</i>

00:39.251 --> 00:43.149
<i>I was unrecognizable to myself</i>

00:43.953 --> 00:46.887
<i>Saw my reflection in a window</i>

00:46.888 --> 00:49.178
<i>And didn't know my own face</i>

00:49.178 --> 00:52.193
<i>So, brother, I'm gonna leave</i>

00:52.194 --> 00:57.418
<i>Wastin' away on the streets
of Philadelphia</i>

01:13.616 --> 01:14.902
This one?

01:14.903 --> 01:19.042
<i>I walked the avenue
till my legs felt like stone</i>

01:19.043 --> 01:22.660
<i>I heard voices of friends
vanished and gone</i>

01:23.745 --> 01:28.488
<i>At night I hear the blood
in my veins</i>

01:29.412 --> 01:33.110
<i>Just as black and whispery
as the rain</i>

01:33.111 --> 01:36.245
<i>On the streets of Philadelphia</i>

01:55.217 --> 01:58.432
<i>Ain't no angel gonna greet me</i>

01:59.236 --> 02:03.376
<i>It's just you and I
my friend</i>

02:04.984 --> 02:08.400
<i>And my clothes don't fit me no more</i>

02:08.401 --> 02:13.826
<i>I walked a thousand miles
just to slip this skin</i>

02:17.323 --> 02:20.941
<i>Night has fallen
I'm lyin' awake</i>

02:20.942 --> 02:24.960
<i>I can feel myself fadin' away</i>

02:25.885 --> 02:30.386
<i>So, will you receive me, brother
with your faithless kiss</i>

02:30.387 --> 02:34.727
<i>Or will we leave each other
alone like this</i>

02:34.728 --> 02:38.224
<i>On the streets of Philadelphia</i>

03:17.855 --> 03:22.879
<i>This "pestilent dust"counselor refers
to has appeared on only three occasions. </i>

03:22.880 --> 03:26.778
Each time it was tested,
and the results: Limestone.

03:26.779 --> 03:28.708
It's messy, but innocuous.

03:31.803 --> 03:34.938
- "Innocuous"?
- Defined by Webster's as harmless.

03:34.938 --> 03:38.434
I know what it means.
May I? Thank you.

03:38.436 --> 03:39.761
Your Honor...

03:43.861 --> 03:47.277
imagine how the children in this
neighborhood are being made to feel.

03:47.278 --> 03:51.297
The constant pounding of construction
ringing in their ears...

03:51.297 --> 03:54.713
as this skyscraper...
a tribute to mankind's greed...

03:54.714 --> 03:58.732
grows daily, casting an ominous shadow
over their lives...

03:58.733 --> 04:02.149
filling them with dread even as
they are surrounded by this toxic dust.

04:02.953 --> 04:05.485
Your Honor, Kendall Construction...

04:05.486 --> 04:09.102
builds neighborhoods,
it doesn't destroy them.

04:09.103 --> 04:12.117
Granting a restraining order against
this construction site will...

04:12.117 --> 04:14.810
throw 753 Philadelphians
out of work...

04:14.810 --> 04:18.950
and lend validation to this contemptible
and groundless nuisance suit.

04:18.951 --> 04:20.960
It's an example
of the rapacious litigation...

04:20.961 --> 04:23.854
that today is tearing
at the very fabric of our society.

04:23.855 --> 04:26.466
Let's not go off the deep end,
gentlemen.

04:26.466 --> 04:30.606
You've made an articulate and
compelling presentation, Mr. Miller...

04:30.607 --> 04:32.817
but I don't believe
you've proven irreparable harm.

04:32.818 --> 04:34.023
Not yet, Your Honor.

04:44.996 --> 04:46.885
Proper use of trade name without...

04:52.431 --> 04:54.521
- Is that you?
- Yeah, that's me.

04:54.521 --> 04:56.049
Miller.

04:56.049 --> 04:58.059
Yes. Hello, Iris.

04:58.059 --> 05:00.551
Client of yours?

05:00.552 --> 05:03.364
Funny. Hold on, Iris.
Excuse me, sir?

05:32.022 --> 05:35.037
My sons and I went
to a restaurant the other day.

05:35.038 --> 05:36.725
We ordered coffee.

05:36.846 --> 05:38.252
The waiter goes...

05:38.252 --> 05:41.347
"Would you like sugar
or Sweet 'n' Low?"

05:42.272 --> 05:45.367
I said,
"Do I look like I should be on a diet?"

05:46.291 --> 05:48.703
Oh, God,
sometimes I just feel so sorry...

05:48.703 --> 05:51.717
- Andy.
- Hi, Doc.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.606
Your blood work came back this morning.

05:53.607 --> 05:55.616
I'm gonna come back in a few minutes
and talk to you about it.

05:55.737 --> 05:58.028
- All right?
- I'll be right here.

05:58.029 --> 05:59.555
Good.

05:59.555 --> 06:01.243
How you doin' today, Jackie?

06:01.243 --> 06:03.856
Hi. How're you feeling?

06:03.856 --> 06:05.866
- Feelin' pretty good.
- Great.

06:05.867 --> 06:10.006
Make a fist for me?
Once more.

06:10.007 --> 06:13.502
Gonna have to start lookin' for veins
in your feet, sweetheart.

06:13.503 --> 06:16.316
- Patience, Tyrone.
- Okay.

06:19.853 --> 06:22.064
Once more.

06:39.347 --> 06:42.080
- How are the Magruder accounts?
- We'll close in a couple weeks.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.969
Terrific job on the Kendall situation.

06:43.969 --> 06:46.180
- Top-notch, Mr. Beckett.
- Thanks, Kenneth, Robert.

06:46.180 --> 06:48.511
- Hi, Mr. Beckett.
- Hi, Rose.

06:48.511 --> 06:52.129
Anthea, just the paralegal
extraordinaire I was hoping to see.

06:52.129 --> 06:54.018
I know what that means.
The answer is no.

06:54.018 --> 06:57.032
- I'm talkin' dinner at Felicia's.
- I've got a class.

06:57.032 --> 07:00.248
I've got some pretty compelling briefs
that need proofing.

07:00.249 --> 07:02.057
You can exploit somebody else.

07:02.659 --> 07:05.674
- Since you've asked...
- Your exam.

07:05.674 --> 07:07.804
Thank you. Ninety-eight.

07:07.805 --> 07:11.824
Ninety-eight? Congratulations.

07:11.825 --> 07:14.034
I have to pick up Amy, but I want
to talk to you about that Hansen thing.

07:14.035 --> 07:17.531
Give me a call. I'll be here. Tell Amy
I loved her painting. It's on my wall.

07:17.531 --> 07:20.063
Hi, Andrew. Conference call's up.
The roll call just started.

07:20.063 --> 07:23.158
Now, this is a settlement agreement.
The red-line copy's on your desk.

07:23.159 --> 07:26.494
- You need me in there?
- No. It's 6:30. Go home.

07:30.112 --> 07:32.122
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Mom!</i>

07:32.202 --> 07:35.417
Oh, hi, darling.
What a wonderful surprise. How are you?

07:35.418 --> 07:37.025
<i>Good. </i>

07:37.025 --> 07:38.954
Well, what does Dr. Gillman say?

07:39.035 --> 07:43.054
Dr. Gillman says I am fine.
My blood work is excellent.

07:43.055 --> 07:44.984
She says my T-cells are steady.

07:44.984 --> 07:47.476
Honey, how 'bout your platelets?
What did she say?

07:47.477 --> 07:49.606
<i>Oh, even my platelets look good. </i>

07:49.607 --> 07:51.013
Great.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.304
Mom, more importantly,
how are you?

07:54.510 --> 07:55.715
<i>Mom?</i>

07:57.725 --> 07:58.931
I'm fine.

07:58.931 --> 08:01.262
<i>- And Dad?
- Dad is fine. </i>

08:01.262 --> 08:02.789
And what are you doin'?

08:22.283 --> 08:23.771
Okay.

08:25.378 --> 08:29.197
"Action for the wrongful interference
with prospective economic relations. "

08:29.198 --> 08:30.403
Okay.

08:36.552 --> 08:38.441
Am I interrupting you?

08:38.441 --> 08:40.652
In a word, Bob...

08:40.652 --> 08:43.064
Charles wants to see you upstairs.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.681
I was just about to take a break.

08:47.405 --> 08:50.017
- I'm not underdressed for this?
- No, you're not.

08:50.018 --> 08:52.911
<i>Charles, Andy has expressed
a keen interest... </i>

08:52.912 --> 08:55.524
<i>in Highline, Inc. V. Sander Systems. </i>

08:55.524 --> 08:57.333
Isn't that right, Andy?

08:57.333 --> 09:01.754
The fate of the participants
interests me. Yes, sir.

09:02.558 --> 09:04.567
It's an antitrust action.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.592
It is, and it isn't, Charles.

09:09.593 --> 09:13.812
Sander Systems copies
Highline's spreadsheet program.

09:13.813 --> 09:15.942
For me...

09:15.943 --> 09:20.565
the legal principle involved is
copyright infringement.

09:21.851 --> 09:23.780
Well, tell me this, Andy.

09:23.780 --> 09:27.880
Which side of this conflict would you
wish to see emerge victorious?

09:27.881 --> 09:31.015
And don't allow my close personal
relationship with Bill Wright...

09:31.015 --> 09:34.833
Sander Systems' C. E. O. To influence
your answer in any way.

09:36.843 --> 09:39.335
Well, I'd like to see Highline
win this one.

09:39.336 --> 09:41.264
Oh! Why, Beckett?

09:43.877 --> 09:46.007
If Sanders Systems wins...

09:46.007 --> 09:50.429
an energetic,
young company is destroyed.

09:50.430 --> 09:54.850
The laws for antitrust and copyright
were enacted to prevent exactly...

09:54.851 --> 09:58.065
the kind of bullshit
that Sander Systems is trying to pull.

09:58.066 --> 10:00.678
- Andy, you know who reps Highline?
- Rodney Bailey.

10:00.679 --> 10:02.085
Oh, I object!

10:04.175 --> 10:08.717
Rodney Bailey, who couldn't find his way
around copyright law with a map.

10:12.415 --> 10:17.037
Well, apparently the fellas
at Highline agree with you, Andy.

10:17.038 --> 10:22.262
Which explains why, as of 9:03
this evening, right after dessert...

10:22.263 --> 10:28.010
Highline is now represented by Wyant,
Wheeler, Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown.

10:28.011 --> 10:29.618
Outstanding.

10:30.823 --> 10:32.713
And more specifically...

10:32.714 --> 10:37.134
Senior Associate Andrew Beckett.

10:37.135 --> 10:39.947
- Bravo!
- Yes!

10:47.102 --> 10:48.710
- Come on!
- Congratulations.

10:48.711 --> 10:53.131
- Thank you, Robert.
- We've got to get on this right away.

10:53.132 --> 10:55.221
Statute of limitations, yeah.
I'm right on it.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.753
- Exactly.
- We have ten days to file.

10:57.753 --> 10:59.441
Tokyo on line four, Bob.

10:59.441 --> 11:02.054
Walter, thank you.

11:03.782 --> 11:05.792
- Kenneth, thank you.
- You bet, Andy. Congratulations.

11:05.872 --> 11:08.807
- Thanks. I'm overwhelmed.
- What's that on your forehead, pal?

11:08.808 --> 11:10.615
What? Where?

11:11.902 --> 11:13.630
That... right there on your forehead.

11:14.514 --> 11:16.845
Oh, I got whacked in the head
with a racket ball.

11:18.132 --> 11:19.538
Excuse me.

11:24.402 --> 11:25.889
Charles, I...

11:27.095 --> 11:31.918
I sincerely appreciate
your faith in my abilities.

11:31.919 --> 11:36.339
Faith, Andy, is the belief in something
for which we have no evidence.

11:36.340 --> 11:39.756
It does not apply to this situation.

11:42.489 --> 11:44.097
Well, go home.

11:44.097 --> 11:45.986
Oh, no! Go back to work.

11:56.436 --> 11:58.044
Thank you, Charles.

11:58.045 --> 11:59.652
No sweat, buddy.

12:06.002 --> 12:09.901
The committee meeting we're gonna have
next week... a bunch of staff members...

12:27.305 --> 12:29.194
Tommy, how are ya?

12:59.460 --> 13:02.073
<i>The Highline complaint is
right there on my desk, Shelby. </i>

13:02.073 --> 13:05.610
<i>It's all set to go,
so make sure Jamey is on top of it. </i>

13:05.610 --> 13:07.901
Sure. You got it.
Anything else?

13:07.901 --> 13:12.242
<i>No, that's it. I'm gonna be working
out of the house this afternoon... </i>

13:12.243 --> 13:13.930
so, thanks a lot.

13:13.930 --> 13:16.060
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. </i>

13:16.061 --> 13:21.165
Okay. Now, you're gonna want to apply
this foundation as evenly as you can.

13:22.290 --> 13:24.782
'Cause you don't want it to look
like you threw it on with a spoon.

13:24.782 --> 13:27.315
- Yeah.
- So, over here, you try this.

13:27.316 --> 13:29.525
- I got it.
- Right there.

13:29.525 --> 13:33.022
Chandra, you don't think this is
just a little too orange for me?

13:33.023 --> 13:37.845
Well, okay, it's Tahitian Bronze.
That works best on these lesions.

13:37.846 --> 13:41.262
Think of it as the
"I just got back from Aruba" look.

13:41.263 --> 13:43.593
Exactly. I've called in sick
for four days...

13:43.593 --> 13:47.090
and now they're gonna think
I was taking a cruise.

13:47.091 --> 13:49.823
- Fax.
- Oh, thank you, Bruno.

13:50.627 --> 13:52.838
Okay, we can try this light Egypt...

13:53.843 --> 13:55.048
What?

13:59.872 --> 14:01.077
Excuse me.

14:07.991 --> 14:10.201
Just like my cousin, Fredo.

14:16.954 --> 14:19.366
Does anybody want a bagel?

14:33.715 --> 14:35.644
You okay, Andy?

14:38.538 --> 14:42.075
I think I need to go
to the hospital.

14:55.058 --> 14:56.465
Watch out!

15:09.327 --> 15:12.020
Hello, hello.
Oh, it's all right.

15:12.743 --> 15:14.753
It's all right.

15:14.753 --> 15:16.762
- I'm gettin' out of here, all right?
- Okay.

15:16.762 --> 15:18.973
I'll talk to you later.
Oh, one more.

15:18.973 --> 15:21.264
Thank you for driving
like a bat out of hell.

15:21.264 --> 15:24.198
- Take it easy, all right?
- Dr. Gillman is out of her office.

15:24.198 --> 15:27.012
I told her to take a day off, and she
took a day off. Can you believe that?

15:27.012 --> 15:29.102
They took blood?
A specimen or something?

15:29.102 --> 15:33.121
Blood, yes. A specimen, I'm empty.
Did you find someone to take your class?

15:33.122 --> 15:34.729
Don't worry about it.
Let me see.

15:34.730 --> 15:37.945
Oh, you got a fever, baby.

15:38.869 --> 15:41.281
Oh, there's my guy.
Excuse me.

15:41.281 --> 15:43.089
Doctor? Hello, hi.

15:43.089 --> 15:44.577
Just one second.

15:45.782 --> 15:48.918
I came that close to not making it
to the bathroom again.

15:48.918 --> 15:51.731
- I almost lost it in front of everyone.
- So what?

15:51.731 --> 15:55.148
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm not ashamed, it's just...

15:56.152 --> 15:58.443
- What about my blood work?
- We're waiting.

15:58.443 --> 16:02.463
Meanwhile, I want to prep you
for a colonoscopy, take a look inside.

16:07.688 --> 16:09.698
- It sounds delightful.
- Wait a minute.

16:09.698 --> 16:11.506
Why do you need to do this?

16:11.627 --> 16:14.843
- Who are you?
- Who are you, Dr...

16:14.844 --> 16:16.852
- This is my partner.
- Yeah?

16:18.339 --> 16:20.872
He keeps the records of all my hospital
visits. It's nothing personal.

16:20.872 --> 16:23.605
Oh, I'm Dr. Klenstein.

16:23.606 --> 16:26.499
Listen, you're right. A colonoscopy
is not a pleasant procedure.

16:26.500 --> 16:30.719
But if the K. S. Is causing the diarrhea,
we've got to know about that right away.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.734
No, but it could be parasites,
an infection. I mean...

16:33.734 --> 16:36.145
Reaction to the A. Z. T.

16:36.145 --> 16:38.477
All these are possibilities,
but we've got to go forward...

16:38.477 --> 16:41.371
Listen to me. He's not going through
some painful procedure...

16:41.372 --> 16:43.983
until we cancel out everything else,
understand?

16:43.983 --> 16:46.314
- I'm trying to help your partner, okay?
- Okay.

16:46.315 --> 16:48.726
- You're not immediate family.
- I'm not?

16:48.727 --> 16:50.816
- I could have you removed from the E. R.
- Really?

16:50.817 --> 16:53.831
Look, he's upset. He's sorry.

16:53.832 --> 16:55.961
No. Don't apologize for me, okay?

16:55.961 --> 16:59.056
Okay. He's not sorry.
Let's do this.

16:59.057 --> 17:01.387
Let's find out
what the blood work tells us.

17:01.387 --> 17:05.607
I'll try to give you a specimen.
Some hospital food may help me along.

17:05.607 --> 17:08.702
Then we might hear from Dr. Gillman.
We can start from there, okay?

17:08.703 --> 17:10.712
- Everybody happy? All right?
- Okay.

17:11.636 --> 17:15.053
- I'll see the lab about the blood work.
- Thank you, Doctor.

17:15.053 --> 17:16.540
I'm sorry.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.484
That's the third time
the office has beeped me.

17:21.485 --> 17:23.494
- I better go.
- "Klenstein"?

17:23.495 --> 17:27.915
I gotta go give them a call.
Now, I want you to sit down and relax.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.523
- I am relaxed.
- Oh, good.

17:29.523 --> 17:31.613
Is there a phone around,
somewhere nearby?

17:31.614 --> 17:33.823
- Down the hall.
- Thank you.

17:33.944 --> 17:37.642
<i>If you or someone you know has been
injured through the fault of others... </i>

17:37.643 --> 17:39.772
<i>you may be entitled
to a cash settlement... </i>

17:39.772 --> 17:42.264
<i>or money damages
for your pain and suffering. </i>

17:42.264 --> 17:44.193
<i>- Good Lord.
- I'm attorneyJoseph Miller. </i>

17:44.193 --> 17:45.801
<i>At McCreedy and... </i>

17:45.802 --> 17:47.007
Mr. Beckett's office.

17:47.087 --> 17:50.906
Shelby, it's me.
Jamey's been beepin' me.

17:50.907 --> 17:52.313
<i>I'm so glad you called, Andrew. </i>

17:52.433 --> 17:56.332
Listen, I just want you to know we have
a minor catastrophe in the making here.

17:56.333 --> 17:59.548
It's about that Highline complaint.
Jamey is going absolutely ballistic.

17:59.548 --> 18:02.200
All right. Calm down.
Put him on.

18:02.201 --> 18:04.089
<i>All right. One second. </i>

18:04.210 --> 18:07.506
<i>Andy, this is a disaster! We can't find
the revisions on the Highline complaint. </i>

18:07.507 --> 18:09.918
Wait, wait. Slow down.

18:09.918 --> 18:13.857
I told them you were working at home,
and it would be here this morning.

18:13.858 --> 18:16.951
No. I brought it into the office
last night.

18:16.952 --> 18:21.172
I was there till 3:00 a. m. There should
be a copy with corrections on my desk.

18:21.173 --> 18:24.588
I'm telling you it's not here, Andy.
Shelby can't find it either.

18:24.588 --> 18:27.723
All right.
The hard disk on my computer.

18:27.723 --> 18:31.421
<i>Print it up on the double and run it
through word processing yourself. </i>

18:31.422 --> 18:35.642
<i>- Okay. What did you file it under?
- H- L-1. </i>

18:35.643 --> 18:39.179
<i>Jamey, I don't have to tell you we are
up against the statute of limitations... </i>

18:39.179 --> 18:41.188
and it runs out in...

18:41.189 --> 18:43.801
in 75 minutes?

18:47.298 --> 18:50.312
<i>- It's not here, Andy.
- Not there? I'm on my way. </i>

18:54.131 --> 18:57.467
Every problem has a solution.

19:09.123 --> 19:12.138
Aw, it's coming.
Yeah, baby, it's coming!

19:12.138 --> 19:14.429
It's a girl.

19:14.429 --> 19:15.755
Oh, my God.

19:19.252 --> 19:22.668
- Take a picture, Joe.
- I'm trying. I can't get the film in.

19:22.669 --> 19:26.205
Oh, my God.
Baby? Help me, baby.

19:29.823 --> 19:32.235
Aw, look at her.

19:32.236 --> 19:34.727
- That little, sweet little...
- Get a picture before she gets too old.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.595
She's perfect, Lisa.
Long hair.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.690
Go down to Famous Fourth Street Deli,
and get a pound of Nova...

19:43.690 --> 19:46.222
No... Scotch salmon.
She likes that.

19:46.222 --> 19:48.835
Yeah. Some onion rolls, bagels...
Here, give me a call.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.719
- Nice champagne.
- You're that TV guy.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.719
I don't care how much it costs.
Get some nice Dom Perignon.

19:54.719 --> 19:56.518
- Thanks.
- How much?

19:56.518 --> 19:59.437
A hundred dollars? Don't get
Dom Perignon. Get a nice Californian.

19:59.437 --> 20:02.436
Dom Perignon's too much. Get it all
over here, because she's starving.

20:02.437 --> 20:05.834
No, Iris, not the baby.
Lisa is starving.

20:05.835 --> 20:09.113
Yeah, Lisa.
Iris, listen.

20:09.114 --> 20:11.432
- Anybody call?
- An Andrew Beckett called.

20:11.432 --> 20:13.911
Beckett? Who's Andrew Beckett?

20:13.912 --> 20:15.830
There he is! Joseph!

20:53.815 --> 20:58.813
The entire street is clear, except for
one small area under construction:

20:58.814 --> 21:01.492
This huge hole that is
clearly marked and blocked off.

21:01.492 --> 21:05.211
- Yes.
- You decide to cross at this spot.

21:05.212 --> 21:08.889
You fall into the hole. Now you want
to sue the city for negligence, right?

21:08.889 --> 21:11.208
Yes. Do I have a case?

21:11.209 --> 21:15.287
- Yes. Of course you've got a case.
- Great.

21:15.288 --> 21:17.286
- Go with my assistant Iris.
- All right.

21:17.286 --> 21:20.405
She'll have you fill out some forms,
tell you about our fee arrangement.

21:20.405 --> 21:23.803
Of course, you know we take no cash
unless we get cash justice for you.

21:23.803 --> 21:26.402
How's your back? You got any
lower back pain, dizziness, nightmares?

21:26.403 --> 21:28.402
Funny you should mention that.
I been having...

21:28.402 --> 21:32.000
Iris will take good care of you.
Iris, you take good care of Mr. Finley.

21:32.001 --> 21:34.519
- I will. Mr. Beckett's here.
- Hey, thanks a lot.

21:34.519 --> 21:37.518
Take care. Mr. Beckett?

21:40.517 --> 21:42.316
Mr. Beckett, come in.

21:47.594 --> 21:49.513
It's good to see you again,
Counselor.

21:49.513 --> 21:53.312
Judge Tate. Kendall Construction.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.711
"Innocuous. "

21:55.711 --> 21:57.590
How are you?
What happened to your face?

21:58.190 --> 21:59.709
I have AIDS.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.908
I'm sorry. I, uh...

22:09.905 --> 22:11.904
- Can I sit down?
- Yeah.

22:11.904 --> 22:13.704
Thank you.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.700
Oh, look at this.

22:23.780 --> 22:25.899
You have a new baby.

22:29.378 --> 22:31.377
Yeah.
I got a little baby girl.

22:35.375 --> 22:38.294
"It's a girl. "
Congratulations.

22:40.373 --> 22:42.292
Yeah. One week old.

22:42.292 --> 22:44.372
Kids are great.

22:44.971 --> 22:48.770
Yeah. Thank you, Beckett.
I'm real excited about it. Listen, I...

22:51.169 --> 22:53.288
What can I do for you?

22:53.288 --> 22:56.687
I've been fired by Wyant, Wheeler.

22:58.366 --> 23:02.604
I want to bring a wrongful termination
suit against Wheeler and his partners.

23:02.605 --> 23:06.483
You want to sue Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?

23:06.483 --> 23:09.402
Correct.
I'm seeking representation.

23:10.881 --> 23:12.401
Continue.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.999
I misplaced an important complaint.
That's their story.

23:18.278 --> 23:20.078
Want to hear mine?

23:23.676 --> 23:26.075
How many lawyers did you go to
before you called me?

23:27.075 --> 23:28.394
Nine.

23:29.994 --> 23:31.473
Continue.

23:32.273 --> 23:36.271
The night before it was due,
I worked on the complaint in my office.

23:36.272 --> 23:37.871
I left a copy of it on my desk.

23:38.870 --> 23:41.589
The next day,
the complaint vanished.

23:42.469 --> 23:44.268
No hard copy.

23:45.468 --> 23:50.266
All traces of it
mysteriously gone from my computer.

23:50.865 --> 23:55.064
<i>Miraculously, a copy of the complaint
was located at the last minute... </i>

23:55.065 --> 23:57.663
<i>and we got it to court on time. </i>

23:58.183 --> 24:02.461
<i>But the next day I was summoned
to a meeting with the managing partners. </i>

24:02.461 --> 24:04.660
<i>They were waiting for me
in the conference room. </i>

24:04.660 --> 24:07.259
Oh, hello, Andy!
Come on in.

24:07.259 --> 24:09.258
Would you mind hitting the windows?

24:11.577 --> 24:13.656
Thanks. Come on in.

24:13.657 --> 24:17.575
Kenneth, Robert, Charles,
Walter and Lydia.

24:17.576 --> 24:19.374
Thanks for coming in.

24:19.374 --> 24:20.854
Oh, of course.

24:20.974 --> 24:25.252
Andy, before we begin,
I'd just like to say...

24:25.253 --> 24:28.051
that everyone in this room
is your friend.

24:28.051 --> 24:29.970
I know that, Charles.

24:29.970 --> 24:32.649
More than your friend...

24:32.649 --> 24:33.848
family.

24:35.168 --> 24:40.886
Charles, I must apologize again
for the Highline mishap yesterday.

24:40.887 --> 24:44.764
That was some scary moment
around here.

24:44.764 --> 24:47.683
Wow. Thank God
the complaint was found...

24:47.684 --> 24:49.762
and no damage was done.

24:49.762 --> 24:52.761
This time.
What about next time?

24:54.280 --> 24:56.280
There won't be a next time.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.879
I guarantee it.

24:57.880 --> 25:02.077
Yeah. It's just that something's
come over you lately, Andy.

25:02.078 --> 25:03.877
I don't know...

25:03.877 --> 25:07.355
some kind of stupor or fogginess.

25:07.355 --> 25:10.274
Some people think you have
an attitude problem, Beckett.

25:12.353 --> 25:14.272
Really?

25:14.272 --> 25:15.672
Who thinks that?

25:15.672 --> 25:17.351
I do.

25:21.070 --> 25:22.869
Excuse me.

25:24.269 --> 25:25.948
Am I being fired?

25:27.147 --> 25:29.267
Let me put it this way, Andy.

25:29.267 --> 25:33.265
Your place in the future
of this firm is no longer secure.

25:33.265 --> 25:36.144
We feel it isn't fair
to keep you here...

25:36.144 --> 25:39.343
when your prospects are limited.

25:40.062 --> 25:44.141
And now,
I don't want to rush you out...

25:44.142 --> 25:45.540
We've got a committee meeting.

25:45.660 --> 25:47.140
Excuse me, Charles...

25:47.140 --> 25:51.338
with all due respect,
this is preposterous!

25:51.339 --> 25:53.057
It doesn't make any sense.

25:53.058 --> 25:55.856
Oh, you're right, Beckett.
You don't have an attitude problem.

25:55.856 --> 25:57.136
Take it easy.

25:57.136 --> 26:00.454
If you'd lost confidence in me,
why did you give me the Highline suit?

26:00.455 --> 26:04.453
Andy, you nearly blew the entire case.
That alone is inexcusable.

26:04.454 --> 26:07.332
It would have been
catastrophic for us.

26:11.650 --> 26:14.249
So you were
concealing your illness.

26:17.048 --> 26:18.647
That's correct.

26:21.046 --> 26:23.365
All right. Explain this to me
like I'm a two-year-old, okay?

26:23.365 --> 26:27.044
Because there's an element to this thing
that I cannot get through my thick head.

26:29.363 --> 26:31.362
Didn't you have an obligation
to tell your employer...

26:31.363 --> 26:33.841
you had this dreaded, deadly,
infectious disease?

26:34.761 --> 26:36.960
That's not the point.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.959
From the day they hired me
to the day I was fired...

26:39.960 --> 26:43.437
I served my clients consistently,
thoroughly, with absolute excellence.

26:43.437 --> 26:46.236
If they hadn't fired me,
that's what I'd be doing today.

26:46.237 --> 26:48.555
And they don't want to fire you
for having AIDS...

26:48.555 --> 26:51.434
so, in spite of your brilliance,
they make you look incompetent.

26:51.435 --> 26:53.833
Thus, the mysterious lost files.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

26:53.833 --> 26:56.632
Correct. I was sabotaged.

27:00.431 --> 27:02.350
I don't buy it, Counselor.

27:04.349 --> 27:06.548
That's very disappointing.

27:06.548 --> 27:08.427
I don't see a case.

27:11.826 --> 27:13.825
I have a case.

27:14.425 --> 27:16.824
If you don't want it
for personal reasons...

27:16.824 --> 27:19.743
Thank you.
That's correct. I don't.

27:21.742 --> 27:23.821
Well, thank you for your time,
Counselor.

27:35.137 --> 27:38.136
I'm sorry about what happened to you.
It's a bitch, you know?

27:49.731 --> 27:51.730
Have a nice day, Mr. Beckett.

27:51.730 --> 27:53.730
What the hell's the matter
with that guy?

27:53.730 --> 27:56.049
Iris, find out
if Armbruster can see me.

27:56.050 --> 27:57.648
- Joe Miller's office.
- Iris.

27:57.648 --> 27:59.247
- Find out if Armbruster can see me.
- Armbruster? When?

27:59.247 --> 28:01.446
- Sometime this afternoon.
- What's wrong with him?

28:01.446 --> 28:02.926
No. Right away, Iris.

28:32.834 --> 28:34.234
Excuse me.

28:39.232 --> 28:43.830
<i>The HIV virus can only be transmitted
through the exchange ofbodily fluids... </i>

28:43.831 --> 28:46.829
namely, blood, semen
and vaginal secretions.

28:46.829 --> 28:49.028
Right. Yeah.

28:49.028 --> 28:52.826
But isn't it true they're finding out
new things about this disease every day?

28:52.827 --> 28:55.105
Now, you tell me today
there's no danger. Go home.

28:55.105 --> 28:57.025
I go home.
I pick up my little baby girl.

28:57.105 --> 28:59.304
Then I find out six months from now
on the news or something:

28:59.304 --> 29:02.702
Whoops! Made a mistake.
Yeah, you can carry it...

29:02.703 --> 29:04.502
on your shirt
or your clothes or...

29:07.021 --> 29:08.700
What are you doing?

29:09.700 --> 29:11.099
We're gonna draw blood.

29:11.219 --> 29:13.218
- Why are we gonna do that?
- Joe.

29:13.218 --> 29:14.897
Little Joe.

29:15.897 --> 29:18.416
I've known you
since you were a kid.

29:18.416 --> 29:21.415
And I don't care a whit
about your private life.

29:23.414 --> 29:26.893
Thanks, Doc. I don't need
an AIDS test, but thanks anyway.

29:26.893 --> 29:28.612
Just send a bill
to my office for me.

29:28.612 --> 29:30.411
Okay?

29:30.411 --> 29:32.531
Thanks for the information.
Really.

29:39.208 --> 29:41.207
You have a problem with gays, Joe.

29:41.207 --> 29:43.726
- Not especially.
- Yes, you do.

29:43.727 --> 29:46.405
- How many gays do you know?
- How many do you know?

29:46.406 --> 29:48.204
- Lots.
- Like who?

29:48.205 --> 29:51.323
Karen Berman, my aunt Theresa...

29:51.923 --> 29:54.122
Cousin Tommy
who lives in Rochester...

29:54.122 --> 29:56.121
Eddie Meyers from the office...

29:57.201 --> 29:59.800
Stanley, the guy who's putting in
our kitchen cabinets.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.119
Aunt Theresa is gay?

30:02.120 --> 30:05.318
That beautiful, sensuous,
voluptuous woman is a lesbian?

30:06.317 --> 30:07.917
Since when?

30:07.917 --> 30:09.916
Probably since she was born.

30:09.916 --> 30:11.395
Oh, man.

30:12.195 --> 30:14.314
All right. Well, hey,
I admit it, okay?

30:14.394 --> 30:17.193
I'm prejudiced. I don't like
homosexuals. There. You got me.

30:17.194 --> 30:20.392
- All right.
- I mean, the way these guys do that...

30:20.393 --> 30:21.791
thing, don't they get confused?

30:21.791 --> 30:23.990
"Oh, I don't know.
Is that yours? Is that mine?"

30:25.710 --> 30:29.388
You know, I don't want to be in bed
with anybody who's stronger than me...

30:29.389 --> 30:30.987
or who has more hair
on their chest.

30:30.988 --> 30:35.106
Now, you can call me old-fashioned,
conservative. Just call me a man.

30:36.785 --> 30:40.304
Besides, I think you have to be a man
to understand how...

30:40.305 --> 30:42.583
really disgusting
that whole idea is anyway.

30:42.583 --> 30:44.382
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:44.382 --> 30:46.701
Well, well.
Little caveman of the house.

30:46.702 --> 30:48.700
You damn skippy.

30:48.700 --> 30:51.299
Here you go, baby.
Stay away from your aunt Theresa too.

30:51.299 --> 30:53.698
Joe, don't say that to her.

30:53.698 --> 30:55.778
Think about those guys
pumping up together...

30:55.778 --> 30:57.897
trying to be macho and faggot
at the same time.

30:57.897 --> 31:00.776
I mean, I can't stand that shit.

31:00.777 --> 31:02.695
Hey, I'm bein' totally honest
with you, okay?

31:02.696 --> 31:06.573
- Oh, yeah. You are.
- All right. I got a question for you.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.972
Would you accept a client...

31:08.973 --> 31:11.292
if you were constantly thinking...

31:11.292 --> 31:13.491
"I don't want this person to touch me.

31:13.491 --> 31:16.090
I don't want him
to even breathe on me"?

31:17.609 --> 31:20.288
- Not if I was you, honey.
- That's what I'm talking about.

31:20.289 --> 31:21.488
What?

31:22.287 --> 31:25.686
<i>Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!</i>

31:27.885 --> 31:29.604
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

31:30.804 --> 31:33.083
- Hey, merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, sir.

31:36.002 --> 31:37.801
Thank...

31:37.802 --> 31:39.201
Happy new year.

31:40.480 --> 31:43.079
- You're the, uh, the TV guy.
- TV guy.

32:30.580 --> 32:31.860
Sir?

32:34.179 --> 32:36.258
This is the supplement.

32:37.178 --> 32:41.976
You're right. There is a section
on HIV-related discrimination.

32:41.977 --> 32:43.855
Thank you.

32:43.855 --> 32:46.174
Thank you very much.

32:55.171 --> 32:58.289
We do have a private research room
available.

32:58.290 --> 33:00.169
I'm fine right here.
Thank you.

33:00.169 --> 33:04.167
<i>Excuse me. Do you know where I can find
the State v. Murdock case?</i>

33:04.168 --> 33:06.286
Just a moment.
I'll be right with you.

33:06.286 --> 33:07.566
Thanks.

33:26.758 --> 33:29.157
Wouldn't you be more comfortable
in a research room?

33:43.152 --> 33:45.271
No.

33:45.272 --> 33:47.270
Would it make you more comfortable?

33:56.266 --> 33:58.466
Beckett. How you doin'?

34:03.264 --> 34:04.743
Counselor.

34:17.258 --> 34:18.937
Whatever, sir.

34:23.935 --> 34:25.135
Excuse me.

34:35.971 --> 34:37.370
Who'd you get?

34:38.370 --> 34:39.569
What?

34:39.569 --> 34:41.848
Did you find a lawyer?

34:43.048 --> 34:44.447
I'm a lawyer.

34:46.447 --> 34:48.446
Hey, how's your baby?

34:48.447 --> 34:51.045
Oh, yeah. She's, uh...

34:51.045 --> 34:52.964
She's wonderful, great.

34:52.964 --> 34:54.763
What's her name?

34:54.843 --> 34:56.842
Larice.

34:56.842 --> 34:59.242
That's a beautiful name.

34:59.761 --> 35:02.360
Named her after my sister.

35:39.226 --> 35:40.545
Look, I'm, uh...

35:46.223 --> 35:48.142
How'd they find out
you have the AIDS?

35:48.142 --> 35:51.621
One of the partners noticed
a lesion on my forehead.

35:57.339 --> 36:00.817
But how do you go from, uh...

36:00.818 --> 36:05.415
How do you go from a lawyer spotting
a lesion, which could be anything...

36:05.416 --> 36:09.054
to the partners deducing
that you have AIDS...

36:09.055 --> 36:12.253
and terminating you
on the basis of that conclusion?

36:14.532 --> 36:16.451
That's a good point.

36:25.328 --> 36:28.846
The partner who spotted the lesion,
Walter Kenton...

36:28.847 --> 36:32.645
worked for Walsh,
Ulmer and Brahm in D. C.

36:32.646 --> 36:35.244
A paralegal there,
Melissa Benedict...

36:35.245 --> 36:38.842
showed lesions on and off
for the better part of two, three years.

36:38.843 --> 36:42.641
She says it was common knowledge around
the office they were caused by AIDS.

36:42.641 --> 36:44.120
But they didn't fire her.

36:44.120 --> 36:47.519
No. They did not fire her.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.638
I see.

36:48.718 --> 36:50.837
So you got a relevant precedent?

36:51.917 --> 36:53.916
<i>The Arline decision. </i>

36:53.916 --> 36:56.315
<i>- Arline?
- Supreme Court. </i>

37:13.628 --> 37:15.628
"The Federal Vocational
Rehabilitation Act...

37:15.628 --> 37:18.427
of 1973 prohibits
discrimination...

37:18.427 --> 37:21.825
against otherwise
qualified handicapped persons...

37:21.825 --> 37:25.904
who are able to perform the duties
required by their employment.

37:25.905 --> 37:28.023
Although the ruling did not
address the specific issue...

37:28.023 --> 37:30.102
of HIV and AIDS discrimination... "

37:30.103 --> 37:34.100
"Subsequent decisions have held
that AIDS is protected as a handicap...

37:34.101 --> 37:38.499
under law, not only because of
the physical limitations it imposes...

37:38.499 --> 37:40.818
but because the prejudice
surrounding AIDS...

37:40.818 --> 37:44.096
exacts a social death which precedes...

37:47.415 --> 37:50.934
which precedes
the actual physical one. "

37:59.610 --> 38:01.929
"This is the essence
of discrimination:

38:03.009 --> 38:07.727
Forming opinions about others
not based on their individual merits...

38:07.728 --> 38:11.806
but rather their membership in a group
with assumed characteristics. "

38:38.515 --> 38:41.194
- Charles Wheeler.
- Julius Erving!

38:41.195 --> 38:43.713
- By golly, I'm glad to see you!
- Ken Starr.

38:43.713 --> 38:46.792
- Ken, how are ya?
- How are ya?

38:46.793 --> 38:48.111
Come over here.

38:53.109 --> 38:55.108
Charles Wheeler, how you doin'?

38:55.108 --> 38:56.508
- How are you?
- Very good.

38:56.508 --> 38:59.307
- Welcome...
- Summons for you.

38:59.307 --> 39:00.706
Take a look at it.
Have a good day.

39:00.707 --> 39:03.705
Hey, Dr. J. How are you?
You're the best.

39:03.705 --> 39:06.184
If you ever need a lawyer for anything,
you give me a call.

39:06.184 --> 39:08.703
If you slip and fall, you know,
accidents, anything, let me know.

39:08.703 --> 39:11.102
See you in court.

39:11.102 --> 39:13.101
- The TV guy.
- Yeah, the TV guy.

39:18.779 --> 39:20.698
Say, Chuck, what's up?

39:20.699 --> 39:25.296
Now, regarding Andy, I want to know
everything regarding his personal life.

39:25.297 --> 39:27.376
Does he frequent those pathetic bars
on Chestnut Street?

39:27.376 --> 39:28.815
- Right.
- Oh, Jesus.

39:28.815 --> 39:31.694
What other homosexual facilities
does he go to?

39:31.695 --> 39:33.213
- Absolutely.
- Charles.

39:33.293 --> 39:37.092
What deviant groups or organizations
does he secretly belong to?

39:37.093 --> 39:38.811
- First thing in the morning.
- Wait a minute!

39:38.811 --> 39:40.091
- Look...
- What is it?

39:40.091 --> 39:43.689
Let's make a fair settlement offer
and put this tragic business behind us.

39:43.690 --> 39:45.608
Bob...

39:45.608 --> 39:49.207
Andy brought AIDS into our offices...

39:49.208 --> 39:51.286
into our men's room.

39:51.286 --> 39:55.485
He brought AIDS
to our annual goddamn family picnic.

39:55.486 --> 39:57.284
We ought to be suing him, Bob.

39:57.284 --> 39:59.803
Where is your compassion,
gentlemen?

39:59.803 --> 40:03.481
Bob, we gave him Highline.
Did Andrew Beckett say...

40:03.481 --> 40:07.480
"I might not be able to serve
our client to the best of my ability"?

40:07.481 --> 40:08.879
He said nothing.

40:08.880 --> 40:12.278
And now, disregarding the trust
and affection I conferred upon him...

40:12.279 --> 40:16.596
Andrew Beckett proposes
to haul me into court...

40:16.597 --> 40:20.875
to sling accusations at me,
to call me a bigot...

40:20.876 --> 40:25.873
in full view of the entire
Philadelphia judicial establishment.

40:25.874 --> 40:27.592
My God!

40:29.271 --> 40:30.671
Excuse me.

40:32.870 --> 40:36.468
Beckett doesn't want to go to court.
He wants a quick, tasty settlement.

40:36.469 --> 40:39.067
A jury might decide
that he has a case.

40:39.068 --> 40:41.386
Wait a minute.

40:41.386 --> 40:45.065
He was fired for incompetence,
not because he has AIDS.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.064
You didn't know he was sick,
did you, Bob?

40:48.064 --> 40:50.583
Holy shit.
Did you, Bob?

40:53.862 --> 40:56.660
No. No, not really.

41:06.976 --> 41:08.696
Okay, everybody.

41:08.776 --> 41:11.974
Everybody, this is the house
that I grew up in...

41:13.174 --> 41:16.573
right here in the hometown
of Lower Merion, Pennsylvania.

41:16.574 --> 41:20.571
Wait, here's proof.

41:20.571 --> 41:25.689
There. My handprints
from when I was a cute little boy.

41:25.690 --> 41:30.487
Today is the 40th wedding anniversary
of my mom and dad, the Becketts.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.887
Isn't that somethin'?

41:31.887 --> 41:35.685
Pretty tough life around this poverty
so many years, huh?

41:35.686 --> 41:38.964
Well, those can be some pretty mean
streets. Don't let appearances fool you.

41:38.964 --> 41:41.483
Here's the front door.
Now, I once slammed...

41:41.483 --> 41:44.082
this finger in the front door
and I broke it.

41:47.081 --> 41:49.879
There's my sisterJill,
everybody.

41:49.880 --> 41:53.159
- Say hello, Alexis.
- Mommy's pregnant again!

41:53.159 --> 41:55.479
What? Are you really?

41:57.359 --> 41:59.679
- Hi, Meghan.
- It's Uncle Andy!

41:59.679 --> 42:03.558
- Where's Dad?
- He's trying to fix the snowblower.

42:03.559 --> 42:06.558
It snows once in seven years,
Dad buys a new snowblower.

42:06.558 --> 42:08.678
Oh, me. How are you?

42:08.678 --> 42:11.078
Oh, Mom, today's a good day.

42:11.078 --> 42:13.758
Meghan, keep that up.
You're doin' a great job.

42:13.758 --> 42:16.157
I gotta say hello
to the Bronte sisters.

42:19.277 --> 42:22.277
How are you?
Good to see you.

42:22.277 --> 42:24.477
Hi, Lee. How are you?

42:27.476 --> 42:29.356
Put me down!

42:30.276 --> 42:32.556
<i>If you let me love you</i>

42:32.556 --> 42:35.876
<i>It's for sure I'm gonna love you</i>

42:37.556 --> 42:41.155
<i>All the way</i>

42:41.156 --> 42:43.555
<i>All</i>

42:43.556 --> 42:46.755
<i>Bud and Sarah</i>

42:46.755 --> 42:48.675
<i>All the way</i>

42:51.995 --> 42:56.074
<i>There will be things said at the trial
that are hard for you to hear... </i>

42:56.075 --> 42:58.194
about me and my personal life.

42:58.194 --> 43:01.074
And there's gonna be publicity. I want
to make sure it's okay with everybody.

43:02.194 --> 43:04.274
Andy, you want me to take her?

43:04.275 --> 43:07.873
No. She's fine.

43:07.873 --> 43:09.793
I think it's great
that you're asking, Andy...

43:09.793 --> 43:13.673
but this is really your call.

43:13.674 --> 43:15.473
All right.
Thank you, brother.

43:18.193 --> 43:21.272
Hey, you're my kid brother.

43:21.273 --> 43:22.792
That's all that matters.
Okay?

43:24.192 --> 43:26.992
To be honest,
I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy.

43:28.992 --> 43:30.592
They've been through
so much already.

43:30.592 --> 43:34.991
And it's possible there are going to be
some very tough times ahead.

43:37.391 --> 43:41.471
Andy, the way that you've handled
this whole thing...

43:41.472 --> 43:46.470
you and Miguel...
with so much courage...

43:46.471 --> 43:48.070
I don't believe there's anything...

43:48.190 --> 43:50.790
that anyone could say
that would...

43:50.791 --> 43:55.870
make us feel anything
but incredibly proud of you.

43:57.590 --> 44:01.389
Well, I didn't raise my kids
to sit in the back of the bus.

44:02.589 --> 44:05.669
You get in there
and you fight for your rights, okay?

44:07.789 --> 44:10.389
Gee, I love you guys.

44:35.387 --> 44:37.786
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of thejury... </i>

44:39.706 --> 44:43.186
forget everything you've seen
on television and in the movies.

44:44.186 --> 44:46.106
There's not gonna be
any last-minute surprise witnesses.

44:46.106 --> 44:48.906
Nobody's gonna break down on the stand
with a tearful confession.

44:48.906 --> 44:52.505
You're gonna be presented with
a simple fact:

44:54.105 --> 44:56.585
Andrew Beckett was fired.

44:56.586 --> 44:58.985
You'll hear two explanations
for why he was fired:

44:58.985 --> 45:01.705
Ours and theirs.

45:01.705 --> 45:06.304
It is up to you to sift
through layer upon layer of truth...

45:06.305 --> 45:09.984
until you determine for yourselves
which version sounds the most true.

45:09.984 --> 45:12.304
There are certain points
that I must prove to you.

45:12.304 --> 45:15.384
Point number one:
Andrew Beckett was...

45:16.703 --> 45:18.783
is... a brilliant lawyer...

45:18.784 --> 45:20.703
a great lawyer.

45:20.703 --> 45:24.383
Point number two: Andrew Beckett,
afflicted with a debilitating disease...

45:24.384 --> 45:27.503
made the understandable,
the personal...

45:28.103 --> 45:31.902
the legal choice to keep
the fact of his illness to himself.

45:31.903 --> 45:36.182
Point number three:
His employers discovered his illness.

45:36.183 --> 45:38.702
And, ladies and gentlemen,
the illness I'm referring to is AIDS.

45:38.702 --> 45:42.381
Point number four: They panicked.

45:46.181 --> 45:49.901
And in their panic, they did what most
of us would like to do with AIDS...

45:49.902 --> 45:52.501
which is just get it
and everybody who has it...

45:52.501 --> 45:55.700
as far away from the rest of us
as possible.

45:58.180 --> 46:01.900
Now, the behavior of Andrew Beckett's
employers may seem reasonable to you.

46:01.901 --> 46:03.380
It does to me.

46:03.500 --> 46:06.700
After all, AIDS is a deadly,
incurable disease.

46:06.701 --> 46:10.899
But no matter how you come to judge
Charles Wheeler and his partners...

46:10.900 --> 46:15.099
in ethical, moral and human terms,
the fact of the matter is...

46:15.100 --> 46:19.219
when they fired Andrew Beckett
because he had AIDS...

46:19.220 --> 46:21.818
they broke the law.

46:27.018 --> 46:28.418
Fact:

46:31.898 --> 46:35.417
Andrew Beckett's performance
on the job...

46:35.418 --> 46:39.097
varied from competent, good...

46:39.098 --> 46:42.217
to oftentimes mediocre...

46:42.218 --> 46:46.217
to sometimes flagrantly incompetent.

46:47.616 --> 46:49.016
Fact:

46:50.096 --> 46:54.216
He claims he's the victim
of lies and deceit.

46:55.816 --> 46:57.096
Fact:

46:57.216 --> 47:00.015
It was Andrew Beckett who lied...

47:00.016 --> 47:04.615
going to great lengths to conceal
his disease from his employers.

47:04.615 --> 47:05.895
Fact:

47:06.815 --> 47:11.615
He was successful
in his duplicity.

47:12.295 --> 47:15.694
The partners at Wyant, Wheeler
did not know...

47:15.694 --> 47:19.694
that Andrew Beckett had AIDS
when they fired him.

47:22.494 --> 47:24.014
Fact:

47:25.693 --> 47:27.493
Andrew Beckett is dying.

47:33.693 --> 47:35.213
Fact:

47:36.693 --> 47:39.692
Andrew Beckett is angry...

47:41.092 --> 47:45.932
because his lifestyle,
his reckless behavior...

47:47.132 --> 47:49.212
has cut short his life.

47:49.212 --> 47:53.131
And in his anger, his rage...

47:53.131 --> 47:55.011
he is lashing out.

47:55.931 --> 47:58.411
And he wants someone to pay.

48:02.411 --> 48:05.130
Thank you.

48:19.329 --> 48:23.809
Andrew Beckett represented your company
in a lawsuit in 1990. Is that correct?

48:23.810 --> 48:25.529
That's correct.

48:25.530 --> 48:27.809
Were you pleased
with his work?

48:27.809 --> 48:31.128
We were satisfied
with the outcome of the litigation.

48:33.728 --> 48:35.128
Satisfied.

48:37.928 --> 48:43.328
Mr. Laird, when I approached you
about being a witness in this trial...

48:43.329 --> 48:46.407
you gave sworn testimony
in a deposition, is that correct?

48:46.407 --> 48:48.727
That's correct.

48:48.727 --> 48:53.927
In that deposition, you said that
you were impressed and delighted...

48:53.928 --> 48:56.207
with the quality
of Andrew Beckett's work.

48:56.207 --> 48:58.006
Do you recall saying that?

49:04.606 --> 49:07.926
In all honesty,
I was delighted...

49:07.927 --> 49:10.525
with certain aspects
of Andy's efforts.

49:11.205 --> 49:14.605
But in general,
I found the work to be...

49:14.605 --> 49:17.525
merely satisfactory.

49:23.524 --> 49:25.524
Do you agree...

49:27.724 --> 49:30.244
that a bologna sandwich
is a satisfactory meal?

49:30.244 --> 49:34.644
Whereas caviar
and champagne...

49:34.645 --> 49:38.643
roast duck and baked Alaska...

49:38.643 --> 49:41.043
that might be considered
a delightful meal?

49:41.044 --> 49:45.123
We object. These gastronomical comments
are irrelevant, Your Honor.

49:45.723 --> 49:47.643
They are not irrelevant.

49:47.644 --> 49:52.842
Your Honor, five months ago this witness
characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar.

49:52.843 --> 49:54.522
Now he's a bologna sandwich.

49:54.523 --> 49:56.842
I think the jury
is entitled to know...

49:56.842 --> 50:01.242
what powerful force
has caused him to change his mind.

50:02.641 --> 50:04.921
He hasn't changed his mind.

50:04.922 --> 50:07.041
He's amplified his answer.

50:07.041 --> 50:09.041
Objection sustained.

50:14.121 --> 50:15.640
All right.

50:18.840 --> 50:23.520
Mr. Laird, explain this to me
like I'm a four-year-old, okay?

50:23.521 --> 50:27.519
Did Andrew Beckett
win your lawsuit for you?

50:28.239 --> 50:29.839
Yes, we won.

50:29.839 --> 50:34.119
Oh, congratulations!
That must've been a very...

50:34.120 --> 50:37.519
satisfactory experience.

50:37.520 --> 50:40.918
"AIDS Cures Homosexuality"
Homophobia's got to go. Hey, hey!

51:04.157 --> 51:07.036
- Ready, Mr. Beckett?
- Get ready. Here they come.

51:07.037 --> 51:09.036
No rights for sodomites!

51:12.636 --> 51:14.956
Adam and Eve!
Not Adam and Steve!

51:14.956 --> 51:17.156
Thou shalt not lie
with mankind.

51:17.236 --> 51:20.355
Do you see this
as a gay rights issue?

51:20.356 --> 51:24.435
I am not political.
I just want what is fair, what is right.

51:24.436 --> 51:26.555
But you are gay, aren't you?

51:26.555 --> 51:30.435
<i>I don't see how that's
any of your business. But, yes, I am. </i>

51:32.235 --> 51:33.634
Totally irrelevant.

51:33.634 --> 51:36.754
<i>Do you think that homosexuals
deserve special treatment?</i>

51:36.754 --> 51:39.434
<i>- Hell, no!
- We're in Philadelphia... </i>

51:39.434 --> 51:43.154
<i>the City of Brotherly Love,
birthplace of freedom... </i>

51:43.155 --> 51:46.553
<i>where the Founding Fathers authored
the Declaration of Independence. </i>

51:46.553 --> 51:48.953
<i>I don't recall that
glorious document saying... </i>

51:48.954 --> 51:51.633
<i>anything about all straight men
are created equal. </i>

51:51.633 --> 51:54.153
<i>I believe it says
all men are created equal. </i>

51:54.153 --> 51:56.433
Gimme a goddamn break.

51:56.433 --> 51:59.152
<i>As far as someone being fired
from a law firm or a business... </i>

51:59.152 --> 52:01.352
<i>if we found that their action
was discriminatory... </i>

52:01.352 --> 52:03.752
<i>they'd do no business with the city. </i>

52:03.752 --> 52:06.432
<i>- Thank you, Mayor.
- Yo!</i>

52:06.433 --> 52:11.232
You're not getting a little light
in the sneakers, are you, pal?

52:20.831 --> 52:24.830
Yeah, I am, Filko.
I'm changing.

52:24.830 --> 52:27.030
I'm on the prowl.

52:27.030 --> 52:29.750
And I'm looking for a hunk,
not just any hunk.

52:29.750 --> 52:31.550
I mean a man,
a real man like you.

52:33.630 --> 52:37.349
You can tell everybody. You know
what we do. You wanna play sailor?

52:37.350 --> 52:40.549
- Remember? You're the first mate?
- That's not funny!

52:40.550 --> 52:43.549
Let me tell you something.
These people make me sick.

52:43.549 --> 52:46.269
But a law's been broken.

52:46.270 --> 52:47.749
You remember the law?

52:53.468 --> 52:55.868
At least we agree
on one thing, Joe.

52:55.869 --> 52:57.868
What's that, Charlie?

52:58.868 --> 53:01.148
Tutti-fruttis make me sick too.

53:07.547 --> 53:11.947
<i>Ms. Benedict, is it true you worked
for Walsh, Ulmer and Brahm... </i>

53:11.948 --> 53:14.747
at the same time as Walter Kenton?

53:14.747 --> 53:15.947
That's correct.

53:16.067 --> 53:18.946
At that time,
did Walter Kenton know...

53:18.947 --> 53:21.866
the K. S. Lesions on your face
and arms were caused by AIDS?

53:21.866 --> 53:25.146
Definitely.
I told all the partners.

53:25.147 --> 53:28.066
How did Walter Kenton treat you
after you told him you had AIDS?

53:29.265 --> 53:34.145
Every time he'd come in contact with me,
he'd get this look on his face.

53:34.146 --> 53:36.465
I refer to it
as the "Oh, God" expression.

53:36.466 --> 53:39.745
As in, "Oh, God,
here comes that woman with AIDS. "

53:40.545 --> 53:43.944
Thank you, Ms. Benedict.
No more questions, Your Honor.

53:43.944 --> 53:47.864
Ms. Benedict,
how did you contract the AIDS virus?

53:47.865 --> 53:51.864
Through a transfusion. I lost a lot of
blood giving birth to my second child.

53:51.865 --> 53:54.944
So, in your case
there was no behavior on your part...

53:54.944 --> 53:57.543
which caused you to be
infected with the virus.

53:57.543 --> 54:00.863
It was something you were unable
to avoid. Isn't that correct?

54:03.063 --> 54:04.263
I guess.

54:09.862 --> 54:11.142
Thank you.

54:11.142 --> 54:13.342
But I don't
consider myself...

54:13.342 --> 54:16.142
any different from anyone else
with this disease.

54:16.142 --> 54:21.461
I'm not guilty. I'm not innocent.
I'm just trying to survive.

54:21.462 --> 54:22.781
Thank you, Ms. Benedict.

54:23.381 --> 54:25.781
No further questions
at this time, Your Honor.

54:27.661 --> 54:29.781
You may step down, Mrs. Benedict.

54:32.181 --> 54:34.780
Beyond noticing
the marks on his face...

54:34.780 --> 54:38.180
were there other things
about his appearance, Miss Burton...

54:38.180 --> 54:42.260
that made you suspect
that Andrew had AIDS?

54:42.261 --> 54:45.580
He was getting thinner,
and he seemed very tired sometimes.

54:45.581 --> 54:49.379
But he was working so hard.
Still, I felt something was wrong.

54:49.379 --> 54:54.259
And I can't believe they're pretending
that they didn't notice anything.

54:54.260 --> 54:56.179
Objection.

54:56.179 --> 54:58.379
Just answer the question, please.

54:58.379 --> 55:01.578
Have you ever felt discriminated against
at Wyant, Wheeler?

55:04.778 --> 55:05.978
Well, yes.

55:06.058 --> 55:08.058
- In what way?
- Well...

55:08.058 --> 55:10.978
Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia...

55:10.978 --> 55:14.257
said that Mr. Wheeler
had a problem with my earrings.

55:14.258 --> 55:17.977
- Really?
- Apparently Mr. Wheeler felt...

55:17.977 --> 55:21.057
that they were too...
"ethnic" is the word she used.

55:21.058 --> 55:23.657
She told me he said
he would like it...

55:23.657 --> 55:26.176
if I wore something
a little less garish...

55:26.176 --> 55:30.376
a little smaller and more American.

55:31.176 --> 55:32.376
What'd you say?

55:32.376 --> 55:35.376
I said, "My earrings are American.

55:35.376 --> 55:38.176
They're African-American. "

55:40.975 --> 55:43.175
Let's have order, please.

55:43.176 --> 55:44.855
Thank you. No more questions.

55:44.855 --> 55:46.775
Ms. Burton...

55:46.775 --> 55:50.375
weren't you recently promoted?

55:51.455 --> 55:53.454
Yes. I'm in charge
of the paralegal department.

55:56.574 --> 56:00.694
Congratulations on your unfettered
ascendancy at Wyant, Wheeler.

56:00.695 --> 56:03.774
I don't know if I'd go so far
as to call it unfettered.

56:03.774 --> 56:07.293
I don't understand.
How do you explain...

56:07.294 --> 56:10.973
the promotion of an obviously...

56:10.973 --> 56:13.493
intelligent, articulate...

56:13.493 --> 56:17.773
qualified
African-American woman...

56:17.774 --> 56:19.772
in a firm which practices
discrimination...

56:19.772 --> 56:24.892
as wantonly and consistently
as you and Mr. Beckett claim?

56:26.492 --> 56:29.492
- I can't explain it.
- Could it be...

56:29.492 --> 56:32.091
that these...

56:32.091 --> 56:34.771
instances of discrimination...

56:34.771 --> 56:37.171
are in fact misunderstandings...

56:37.172 --> 56:40.371
that have been blown
completely out of proportion?

56:42.971 --> 56:47.170
I think counsel tends to
oversimplify the issue somewhat.

56:47.171 --> 56:49.770
Thank you, Miss Burton,
I'll...

56:49.770 --> 56:52.490
take that note
under consideration.

57:12.008 --> 57:13.928
- How's the trial going?
- Excuse me?

57:13.928 --> 57:16.528
It's a great case. I saw you on
television. I'm a law student at Penn.

57:16.528 --> 57:18.728
- How you doing?
- All right. How are you?

57:18.728 --> 57:20.528
- Saw me on TV?
- Yeah.

57:20.529 --> 57:22.408
It's a good school, Penn.
What year are you in?

57:22.408 --> 57:26.527
Second. Listen,
I just want to tell you...

57:26.527 --> 57:29.327
this case,
it's tremendously important.

57:29.328 --> 57:32.247
I wanted to let you know
I think you're doing a fantastic job.

57:32.248 --> 57:36.326
- Hey.
- Thank you. All right.

57:36.327 --> 57:38.126
When you graduate,
you give me a call.

57:38.246 --> 57:41.446
Okay. All right.
Thank you very much.

57:41.447 --> 57:44.326
- Listen, Joe?
- Yeah?

57:44.326 --> 57:47.846
Would you like to have a drink? I just
finished a game and could use a beer.

57:47.847 --> 57:50.125
Ah, no, I can't.
My wife is...

57:52.245 --> 57:54.325
I don't pick up people
in drugstores every day.

58:04.124 --> 58:06.524
- You think I'm gay?
- Aren't you?

58:07.324 --> 58:10.044
What's the matter?
I look gay to you?

58:10.044 --> 58:11.444
Do I look gay to you?

58:13.524 --> 58:16.843
- Relax.
- I ought to kick your faggoty ass.

58:16.844 --> 58:18.443
Take it as a compliment.
Geez!

58:22.323 --> 58:27.523
That is exactly the kind of bullshit
that makes people hate your...

58:27.524 --> 58:29.242
faggoty ass.

58:29.242 --> 58:31.362
You want to try
and kick my ass, Joe?

58:31.363 --> 58:34.242
- Asshole.
- No, you're the asshole, buddy!

58:42.641 --> 58:44.161
<i>Please continue, Ms. O'Hara. </i>

58:44.161 --> 58:48.641
We were going crazy looking
for this complaint.

58:48.642 --> 58:50.441
I felt like I was
in the twilight zone.

58:50.561 --> 58:54.160
Mr. Beckett was screaming
at everybody and he just...

58:54.161 --> 58:56.160
He looked so freaky.

58:56.161 --> 58:59.160
Mr. Kenton kept saying,
"You lost the Highline complaint?"

58:59.160 --> 59:02.760
And he called Mr. Wheeler,
and all of a sudden...

59:02.761 --> 59:06.040
Jamey comes in with the complaint
in his hand.

59:06.040 --> 59:11.159
- He says, "It was in central files. "
- Central files?

59:11.160 --> 59:16.639
Central files is a place where paperwork
is sent when cases are closed.

59:16.640 --> 59:18.558
Jamey ran it over
to the court just in time...

59:18.558 --> 59:23.836
and everybody just stood
there completely wasted.

59:24.436 --> 59:25.836
And Mr...

59:27.155 --> 59:29.434
And Mr. Beckett
just kept saying...

59:29.554 --> 59:34.073
"I'm sorry. Sorry.
I don't understand this. "

59:34.153 --> 59:36.952
Thank you, Ms. O'Hara.

59:37.152 --> 59:39.151
No further questions
at this time, Your Honor.

59:39.271 --> 59:41.950
All right. Mr. Miller.

59:48.547 --> 59:50.347
- May I?
- Certainly.

59:59.943 --> 1:00:01.343
Thank you.

1:00:02.342 --> 1:00:05.141
- You okay?
- Yes.

1:00:05.142 --> 1:00:07.261
- You want a glass of water?
- No.

1:00:11.539 --> 1:00:12.939
Was Andy a good boss?

1:00:12.939 --> 1:00:15.258
Yes.

1:00:16.657 --> 1:00:18.537
He was very sweet.

1:00:20.656 --> 1:00:24.654
How would you characterize
his work as an attorney?

1:00:25.934 --> 1:00:28.453
How would I know?
I just worked for him.

1:00:31.852 --> 1:00:35.051
Excuse me, Your Honor,
but is this for the record?

1:00:35.571 --> 1:00:38.969
Mr. Miller, perhaps you should
return to counsel's table.

1:00:38.970 --> 1:00:40.369
Yes, sir.

1:00:51.565 --> 1:00:54.444
- Miss O'Hara?
- Yes?

1:00:54.445 --> 1:00:55.843
Were you aware...

1:00:55.963 --> 1:00:59.842
at any time of any problems
that the senior partners had...

1:00:59.843 --> 1:01:03.760
with the quality of Andrew's work
prior to this missing file episode?

1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:07.159
No, I wasn't.

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:10.758
Thank you.
No more questions, Your Honor.

1:01:15.636 --> 1:01:20.035
Is Andrew Becket the kind of lawyer
who misplaces crucial documents?

1:01:20.036 --> 1:01:23.633
Not to my knowledge. No.

1:01:23.633 --> 1:01:28.352
If you wanted to make a lawyer look
incompetent, would this be a good way?

1:01:28.353 --> 1:01:31.950
Hiding an important document
maybe for a few hours...

1:01:31.951 --> 1:01:35.949
and then making it look like
the responsible lawyer misplaced it?

1:01:35.950 --> 1:01:39.468
Why would Mr. Wheeler and the others
behave so outrageously?

1:01:39.468 --> 1:01:41.347
Because they found out
Andy was sick?

1:01:41.348 --> 1:01:43.866
- He's not answering the question.
- Perhaps.

1:01:43.866 --> 1:01:48.744
We've had lawyers with heart attacks,
ulcers, prostate cancer, leukemia!

1:01:48.745 --> 1:01:50.264
No one sandbagged them.

1:01:50.264 --> 1:01:55.262
Did you have something to do with this
file being lost accidentally on purpose?

1:01:55.263 --> 1:01:56.741
- Objection.
- I'll rephrase.

1:01:56.861 --> 1:02:00.260
Did you have anything
to do with this file being misplaced?

1:02:00.261 --> 1:02:01.860
Absolutely not.

1:02:01.860 --> 1:02:03.539
Are you a homosexual?

1:02:03.539 --> 1:02:08.337
- What?
- Answer the question! Are you a homo?

1:02:08.338 --> 1:02:09.657
A faggot? A punk?

1:02:09.658 --> 1:02:12.256
A queen, pillow biter, fairy?

1:02:12.256 --> 1:02:16.254
Bootie snatcher, rump roaster?
Are you gay?

1:02:16.255 --> 1:02:18.334
- Objection!
- Order!

1:02:18.334 --> 1:02:21.932
Where did this come from? Suddenly
counsel's attacking his own witness?

1:02:21.933 --> 1:02:27.530
Mr. Collins' sexual orientation
has nothing to do with this case.

1:02:27.531 --> 1:02:29.530
Please have a seat, Miss Conine.

1:02:33.848 --> 1:02:36.247
Would you approach the bench,
Mr. Miller?

1:02:47.763 --> 1:02:50.362
Could you kindly
share with me...

1:02:50.362 --> 1:02:52.641
exactly what's going on
inside your head...

1:02:52.642 --> 1:02:56.240
because at this moment,
I don't have a clue.

1:02:59.839 --> 1:03:01.238
Your Honor...

1:03:03.438 --> 1:03:06.237
everybody in this courtroom...

1:03:06.238 --> 1:03:10.035
is thinking about sexual orientation,
sexual preference...

1:03:10.036 --> 1:03:12.634
whatever you want to call it.

1:03:12.634 --> 1:03:16.953
Who does what to whom
and how they do it.

1:03:16.954 --> 1:03:20.032
They're looking at Andrew Beckett.
They're thinking about it.

1:03:20.032 --> 1:03:23.950
They're looking at Mr. Wheeler,
Miss Conine, even you, Your Honor.

1:03:23.951 --> 1:03:27.149
They're wondering about it.

1:03:27.149 --> 1:03:30.428
Trust me, I know they're looking at me
and thinking about it.

1:03:30.429 --> 1:03:35.266
So let's get it out in the open.
Let's get it out of the closet.

1:03:35.267 --> 1:03:38.545
Because this case is not
just about AIDS, is it?

1:03:38.545 --> 1:03:41.344
So let's talk about what
this case is really all about:

1:03:41.344 --> 1:03:43.743
The general public's hatred,
our loathing...

1:03:43.743 --> 1:03:48.461
our fear of homosexuals...

1:03:48.462 --> 1:03:51.140
and how that climate
of hatred and fear...

1:03:51.141 --> 1:03:55.259
translated into the firing
of this particular homosexual...

1:03:55.260 --> 1:03:57.938
my client, Andrew Beckett.

1:04:00.137 --> 1:04:02.137
Please have a seat, Mr. Miller.

1:04:07.535 --> 1:04:09.454
Very good.

1:04:09.534 --> 1:04:11.853
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller,
justice is blind...

1:04:11.853 --> 1:04:16.731
to matters of race, creed, color...

1:04:16.732 --> 1:04:19.450
religion and sexual orientation.

1:04:19.451 --> 1:04:21.849
With all due respect,
Your Honor...

1:04:24.329 --> 1:04:27.527
we don't live in this courtroom,
though, do we?

1:04:27.527 --> 1:04:30.526
No, we don't.

1:04:30.526 --> 1:04:32.246
However, as regards to this witness...

1:04:32.246 --> 1:04:35.365
I'm going to sustain
the defense's objection.

1:04:37.244 --> 1:04:41.762
How many weeks would you be out to sea
without stopping at port?

1:04:41.763 --> 1:04:46.041
Oh, anywhere from two weeks
to several months.

1:04:46.042 --> 1:04:47.960
Any women on board?

1:04:47.961 --> 1:04:50.559
Not when I was in the navy.

1:04:52.838 --> 1:04:56.357
So, during these long voyages...

1:04:56.357 --> 1:05:00.356
months at a time out to sea,
no women in sight...

1:05:00.357 --> 1:05:04.554
hundreds of hardworking, robust
young men in the prime of their lives...

1:05:04.555 --> 1:05:08.033
at the peak of their natural appetites
and desires...

1:05:08.033 --> 1:05:12.031
their God-given hormonal instincts,
anything going on?

1:05:12.951 --> 1:05:14.631
Going on? Like what?

1:05:14.631 --> 1:05:18.749
Like two sailors down below
making flippy-flop.

1:05:18.750 --> 1:05:22.228
- Objection.
- Mr. Miller.

1:05:22.229 --> 1:05:24.147
We had one guy like that.

1:05:24.147 --> 1:05:26.546
You haven't ruled on my objection,
Your Honor.

1:05:26.547 --> 1:05:28.346
Go on, Mr. Miller.

1:05:28.347 --> 1:05:32.024
You had one guy like that.
You mean a homosexual?

1:05:32.025 --> 1:05:36.263
He strutted around quarters naked
trying to get everybody to notice him.

1:05:36.263 --> 1:05:38.342
Made everyone sick.

1:05:38.342 --> 1:05:40.341
He was destroying our morale.

1:05:40.342 --> 1:05:43.940
So we let him know this kind
of behavior was not acceptable.

1:05:43.941 --> 1:05:46.259
How'd you do that?
Wrote him a letter?

1:05:46.259 --> 1:05:49.258
We stuck his head in a latrine
after ten of us had used it.

1:05:49.258 --> 1:05:53.137
- You taught him a lesson, didn't you?
- Yes, we did.

1:05:53.138 --> 1:05:55.336
- Like firing Andrew taught him a lesson.
- Objection.

1:05:55.336 --> 1:05:59.534
I withdraw. You were aware
when you worked with Melissa Benedict...

1:05:59.534 --> 1:06:01.054
that she had AIDS, correct?

1:06:01.054 --> 1:06:03.133
- She didn't try to conceal it.
- So you are aware...

1:06:03.133 --> 1:06:06.852
of the difference between
a bruise and a lesion. Correct?

1:06:06.853 --> 1:06:10.131
Beckett told me he had been hit
by a racket ball, and I believed him.

1:06:10.131 --> 1:06:14.649
Did you avoid contact with Ms. Benedict
after you found out she had AIDS?

1:06:14.650 --> 1:06:19.647
She says and I quote, that you were
repulsed by her. Is that correct?

1:06:20.447 --> 1:06:22.526
I felt,
and I still feel nothing...

1:06:22.526 --> 1:06:26.645
but the deepest sympathy and compassion
for people like Melissa...

1:06:26.646 --> 1:06:30.523
who contracted this terrible disease
through no fault of their own.

1:06:44.358 --> 1:06:45.758
Don't move now.

1:06:51.156 --> 1:06:52.635
Okay.

1:07:06.230 --> 1:07:09.429
Boy. It's not going through.

1:07:11.749 --> 1:07:13.948
We may have to flush it out again.

1:07:20.146 --> 1:07:22.225
The vein's closed.

1:07:23.144 --> 1:07:26.143
We've got to call Barbara.

1:07:26.144 --> 1:07:29.622
- Nurse Ratchett.
- Wait a minute.

1:07:29.622 --> 1:07:31.541
Yeah. Tell her to come over.

1:07:37.019 --> 1:07:40.858
Look, I've... There's so much stuff
that I need to get done.

1:07:42.857 --> 1:07:46.656
Can we... Can we just skip
the treatment for tonight?

1:07:46.656 --> 1:07:50.735
No. We are not
skipping this treatment.

1:07:50.736 --> 1:07:55.053
It's my arm, and it's my treatment,
and I say skip it.

1:08:01.331 --> 1:08:02.730
Well...

1:08:05.649 --> 1:08:07.129
You know something?

1:08:08.328 --> 1:08:10.527
That stuff is saving your life.

1:08:10.527 --> 1:08:12.127
What's the matter with you tonight?

1:08:13.047 --> 1:08:14.446
Close the law book.

1:08:14.526 --> 1:08:16.525
Will you just...

1:08:27.121 --> 1:08:29.241
The least you can do...

1:08:29.242 --> 1:08:31.840
is look at me...

1:08:31.841 --> 1:08:34.039
and give me a little
of your time, man.

1:08:34.039 --> 1:08:35.758
Got it?

1:08:36.838 --> 1:08:39.957
You are worried...

1:08:39.957 --> 1:08:43.636
we don't have very much time left,
now, aren't you?

1:08:45.155 --> 1:08:47.354
No. No.

1:09:01.749 --> 1:09:04.748
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

1:09:04.749 --> 1:09:08.347
I'm going to start planning
my memorial service.

1:09:08.347 --> 1:09:11.146
I'm going to start preparing
for the inevitable.

1:09:16.744 --> 1:09:19.023
Maybe you should
think about it.

1:09:37.336 --> 1:09:38.856
No.

1:09:50.652 --> 1:09:52.251
I've got a better idea.

1:10:06.646 --> 1:10:09.725
- Hi, Andrew. Hi, Miguel.
- Hey, hey!

1:10:09.726 --> 1:10:12.524
- Oh, Joe Miller, Counselor.
- My wife, Lisa.

1:10:12.524 --> 1:10:15.643
- Are you Lisa? Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1:10:15.643 --> 1:10:19.121
- You look wonderful!
- Maria, Lisa.

1:10:19.122 --> 1:10:22.840
- Miguel's sister, Maria.
- How are you, Maria?

1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:25.439
- Do you care for something to drink?
- I'll take care ofJoe.

1:10:27.718 --> 1:10:31.037
You're looking, uh, alive tonight!

1:10:31.038 --> 1:10:33.836
I had a blood transfusion,
and I feel great.

1:10:33.836 --> 1:10:38.554
So, you like it?
I'm a lawsuit.

1:10:38.555 --> 1:10:40.354
You get it?
I'm a lawsuit.

1:10:40.355 --> 1:10:43.233
- It's not bad.
- Lawsuit.

1:10:43.233 --> 1:10:45.232
- What are you drinking?
- Wine is good.

1:10:45.232 --> 1:10:47.151
Can I have some
of the red, please?

1:10:49.750 --> 1:10:53.549
We've got to get to this Q and A
sometime tonight, you know?

1:10:53.550 --> 1:10:55.428
Sure. Just one problem.

1:10:55.428 --> 1:10:58.147
- I'm at a party right now.
- Fine. Whatever.

1:10:58.147 --> 1:11:00.746
- We'll get to it, just later.
- Thank you.

1:11:00.746 --> 1:11:03.545
Hi, Joe Miller.

1:11:03.546 --> 1:11:05.825
- Do I know you?
- Mona Lisa.

1:11:05.826 --> 1:11:10.023
Ah. Uh, lawsuit.

1:11:10.024 --> 1:11:11.423
Nice. Have fun.

1:11:21.339 --> 1:11:23.338
<i>Mr. Sandman</i>

1:11:23.338 --> 1:11:25.418
<i>Bring me a dream</i>

1:11:25.418 --> 1:11:29.216
<i>Make him the cutest boy
that I've ever seen</i>

1:11:29.217 --> 1:11:32.935
<i>Give him two lips
like roses in clover</i>

1:11:32.935 --> 1:11:36.334
<i>Then tell me that
my lonesome nights are over</i>

1:11:36.335 --> 1:11:38.133
<i>Mr. Sandman</i>

1:11:38.133 --> 1:11:40.252
<i>I'm so alone</i>

1:11:40.332 --> 1:11:43.051
<i>Don't have a boyfriend
to call my own</i>

1:11:43.052 --> 1:11:47.130
<i>Oh, won't you please turn on
your magic beam</i>

1:11:47.131 --> 1:11:50.928
<i>Mr. Sandman, bring us a dream</i>

1:11:50.929 --> 1:11:54.447
<i>It is hard to imagine</i>

1:11:54.448 --> 1:11:59.245
<i>Oh, that nothing at all</i>

1:11:59.246 --> 1:12:01.924
<i>Could be so exciting</i>

1:12:06.643 --> 1:12:08.522
<i>And so much fun</i>

1:12:09.642 --> 1:12:12.241
<i>Oh, heaven</i>

1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:17.319
<i>Is a place</i>

1:12:20.238 --> 1:12:25.116
<i>Where nothing
Oh, nothing</i>

1:12:25.117 --> 1:12:30.034
<i>Can go wrong</i>

1:12:50.547 --> 1:12:52.426
Thank you.

1:12:57.545 --> 1:12:59.824
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1:13:01.423 --> 1:13:04.222
Congratulations, Counselor.

1:13:04.222 --> 1:13:05.622
Congratulations?

1:13:05.622 --> 1:13:10.340
You've survived what I assume to be
your first gay party intact.

1:13:15.618 --> 1:13:17.018
Let me tell you something.

1:13:17.018 --> 1:13:20.136
When you're brought up the way
most people are in this country...

1:13:20.136 --> 1:13:23.415
there's not a whole lot of discussion
about homosexuality...

1:13:23.416 --> 1:13:27.214
or what do you call it,
alternate lifestyles.

1:13:27.214 --> 1:13:30.333
As a kid you're taught
that queers are funny, queers are weird.

1:13:30.334 --> 1:13:33.812
Queers dress up like their mother,
that they're afraid to fight...

1:13:33.812 --> 1:13:36.251
that they're a danger
to little kids.

1:13:36.251 --> 1:13:38.930
That all they want to do
is get into your pants.

1:13:42.049 --> 1:13:46.127
That pretty much sums up the general
thinking, if you want to know the truth.

1:13:47.846 --> 1:13:50.046
- Thank you for sharing that with me.
- You're very welcome.

1:13:50.046 --> 1:13:53.245
Let's go over this testimony.
We've got a big day on Monday.

1:13:55.924 --> 1:13:58.723
Okay. First I'll ask you...

1:13:58.723 --> 1:14:00.922
"Can you describe
the circumstances in which...

1:14:00.922 --> 1:14:04.041
you joined the firm Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?"

1:14:04.041 --> 1:14:05.440
Miller?

1:14:07.639 --> 1:14:10.438
Do you ever pray?

1:14:12.038 --> 1:14:15.637
Andrew, that is not
the answer to the question.

1:14:15.638 --> 1:14:17.236
But, yes, I pray.

1:14:18.116 --> 1:14:21.714
- What do you pray for?
- What do you mean?

1:14:21.715 --> 1:14:24.713
I pray that... I don't know!

1:14:24.713 --> 1:14:29.711
I pray my baby is healthy.
I pray my wife made it through delivery.

1:14:29.712 --> 1:14:31.511
I pray the Phillies
win the pennant.

1:14:33.430 --> 1:14:35.709
Now, can we go through
these questions?

1:14:35.709 --> 1:14:38.748
Number one: "Can you describe
the circumstances in which...

1:14:38.748 --> 1:14:42.547
you joined the firm Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?"

1:14:42.548 --> 1:14:44.026
Can you do that for me?

1:14:44.146 --> 1:14:47.945
There's a possibility I won't be around
to see the end of this trial.

1:14:49.025 --> 1:14:51.024
Yes, I've considered that.

1:14:51.025 --> 1:14:56.422
I've made some provisions
in my will for some charities.

1:14:57.422 --> 1:15:00.021
Miguel will need a lawyer.
I know it's not your area.

1:15:00.740 --> 1:15:02.620
I know a good probate lawyer.

1:15:02.620 --> 1:15:05.938
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Now...

1:15:05.939 --> 1:15:09.217
"Can you describe
the circumstances in which...

1:15:09.218 --> 1:15:12.536
you joined the firm Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?"

1:15:18.334 --> 1:15:21.013
Do you mind this music?
Do you like opera?

1:15:24.812 --> 1:15:28.810
I am not that familiar
with opera, Andrew.

1:15:31.209 --> 1:15:34.208
Oh, this is my favorite aria.

1:15:34.808 --> 1:15:36.927
It's Maria Callas.

1:15:38.727 --> 1:15:40.726
<i>It's Andrea Chenier. </i>

1:15:43.045 --> 1:15:45.524
Umberto Giordano.

1:15:48.323 --> 1:15:50.243
This is Madeleine.

1:15:52.322 --> 1:15:55.121
She's saying how...

1:15:55.121 --> 1:16:00.039
during the French Revolution
the mob set fire to her house.

1:16:02.318 --> 1:16:05.637
And her mother died,
saving her.

1:16:05.637 --> 1:16:07.716
She says, "Look!

1:16:07.716 --> 1:16:11.315
The place that cradled me
is burning.

1:16:15.314 --> 1:16:17.233
I am alone. "

1:16:24.710 --> 1:16:28.429
Do you hear the heartache
in her voice?

1:16:29.109 --> 1:16:30.508
Can you feel it?

1:16:38.145 --> 1:16:43.024
Now, in come the strings,
and it changes everything.

1:16:43.025 --> 1:16:45.743
It's like the music...
it fills with a hope.

1:16:49.941 --> 1:16:51.940
And that'll change again.
Listen.

1:16:56.019 --> 1:16:57.538
Listen.

1:17:01.137 --> 1:17:04.536
"I bring sorrow
to those who love me. "

1:17:04.536 --> 1:17:07.615
Oh, that single cello!

1:17:16.532 --> 1:17:20.810
"It was during this sorrow
that love came to me.

1:17:28.207 --> 1:17:31.006
A voice filled with harmony.

1:17:33.925 --> 1:17:36.205
It said, "Live still.

1:17:39.723 --> 1:17:41.643
I am life.

1:17:44.442 --> 1:17:46.921
Heaven is in your eyes.

1:18:28.426 --> 1:18:33.304
It's everything around you.
It's the blood and the mud.

1:18:33.305 --> 1:18:35.103
I am divine!

1:18:36.703 --> 1:18:38.702
I am oblivion.

1:18:41.501 --> 1:18:43.420
I am the god...

1:18:46.739 --> 1:18:49.738
that comes down from the heavens
to the earth...

1:18:49.738 --> 1:18:53.337
and makes of the earth a heaven.

1:19:04.733 --> 1:19:07.332
I am love.

1:19:09.011 --> 1:19:10.931
I am love. "

1:19:29.724 --> 1:19:31.923
Geez, I better get out of here.

1:19:34.122 --> 1:19:37.601
Lisa's...
I told her that, you know...

1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:43.239
I'll look over the Q and A.

1:19:43.239 --> 1:19:45.238
No, you're ready.

1:20:21.305 --> 1:20:22.705
Jesus.

1:20:48.736 --> 1:20:50.215
God.

1:21:28.201 --> 1:21:29.601
Yes, baby.

1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:35.120
Oh, I love you, little Larice.

1:23:11.640 --> 1:23:14.360
Place your left hand on the Bible.
Raise your right hand.

1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:17.640
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:19.560
- I do.
- Please be seated.

1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:29.040
Andrew, can you describe
the circumstances in which...

1:23:29.041 --> 1:23:33.360
you joined the firm Wyant, Wheeler,
Hellerman, Tetlow and Brown?

1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:39.040
Wyant, Wheeler
aggressively recruited me.

1:23:39.040 --> 1:23:42.440
They were the most
prestigious firm in Philadelphia...

1:23:42.441 --> 1:23:44.280
full of opportunity.

1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:46.960
And I was impressed
with the partners.

1:23:46.960 --> 1:23:50.480
- Including Charles Wheeler?
- Particularly Charles.

1:23:50.480 --> 1:23:52.480
What impressed you about him?

1:23:52.560 --> 1:23:56.560
He was the kind of lawyer
I thought I wanted to be.

1:23:56.561 --> 1:23:58.480
What kind of lawyer is that?

1:23:58.481 --> 1:24:01.760
Possessed of an encyclopedic
knowledge of the law...

1:24:01.761 --> 1:24:05.480
a razor-sharp litigator,
genuine leader.

1:24:05.481 --> 1:24:09.360
Gifted at bringing out
the very best in others...

1:24:09.361 --> 1:24:13.360
and an awesome ability
to illuminate...

1:24:13.361 --> 1:24:18.480
the most complex of legal concepts
to a colleague, a courtroom...

1:24:18.481 --> 1:24:21.280
to the man in the street.

1:24:21.281 --> 1:24:25.960
The kind of person who can play
three sets of tennis...

1:24:25.961 --> 1:24:27.760
but doesn't sweat.

1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:31.880
Underneath an elegant surface...

1:24:31.881 --> 1:24:34.080
he has an adventurous spirit.

1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:39.160
In the years
you worked at Wyant, Wheeler...

1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:41.760
did you ever tell Charles Wheeler
you were gay?

1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:43.680
No, I didn't.

1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:45.480
Why not?

1:24:45.481 --> 1:24:47.680
You don't bring your personal life
into a law firm.

1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:50.400
You're not supposed to have
a personal life, really.

1:24:50.400 --> 1:24:55.400
Anyway, I did plan
to tell Charles eventually.

1:24:55.401 --> 1:24:57.600
But then something happened...

1:24:57.600 --> 1:24:59.280
at the racket club...

1:24:59.281 --> 1:25:02.080
about three years ago.

1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.480
<i>Somebody started telling
some jokes. </i>

1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:14.080
What do you call a woman who has
P. M. S. and E. S. P. at the same time?

1:25:14.081 --> 1:25:16.680
I don't know!
What do you call her?

1:25:16.680 --> 1:25:19.200
A bitch who knows everything.

1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:22.200
Sounds like someone I know.

1:25:22.201 --> 1:25:25.600
Hey, Walter, how does a faggot
fake an orgasm?

1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:28.000
He throws a quart of hot yogurt
on your back!

1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:33.080
That reminds me...

1:25:33.200 --> 1:25:34.600
<i>How'd that make you feel?</i>

1:25:34.601 --> 1:25:35.800
Relieved...

1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:39.800
that I never told him
I was gay.

1:25:41.080 --> 1:25:43.200
Just very relieved.

1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:46.200
All right.

1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:48.400
Are you a good lawyer, Andrew?

1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:50.720
I'm an excellent lawyer.

1:25:50.721 --> 1:25:53.320
What makes you
an excellent lawyer?

1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:55.000
I love the law.

1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:57.400
I know the law.

1:25:57.400 --> 1:25:59.400
I excel at practicing.

1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:02.000
What do you love
about the law, Andrew?

1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:05.800
I... Many things.

1:26:07.720 --> 1:26:09.520
What I love the most?

1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:11.720
Yes.

1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:14.720
Is that
every now and again...

1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:17.920
not often, but occasionally...

1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:21.520
you get to be a part of...

1:26:21.521 --> 1:26:25.200
justice being done.

1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:28.800
That really is...

1:26:28.920 --> 1:26:31.920
quite a thrill
when that happens.

1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:39.520
Thank you, Andrew.

1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:45.520
You said earlier...

1:26:45.521 --> 1:26:51.240
you aspire to be the kind of person
who had an adventurous spirit, correct?

1:26:51.241 --> 1:26:52.840
Something like that.

1:26:52.920 --> 1:26:55.040
Do you take risks?

1:26:55.040 --> 1:26:58.520
In my work, yes.
Calculated risks.

1:26:58.521 --> 1:27:00.119
You have to.

1:27:04.439 --> 1:27:07.839
Did your doctor ever tell you
to reduce stress?

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:10.919
That long hours
and stressful working conditions...

1:27:10.919 --> 1:27:13.039
might damage the immune system...

1:27:13.039 --> 1:27:16.519
and speed up your illness?

1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:21.039
My doctor mentioned the impact AIDS...
Excuse me.

1:27:22.319 --> 1:27:27.119
My doctor mentioned the impact
stress could have on the immune system.

1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:31.439
Have you ever been
to the Stallion Showcase Cinema...

1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:33.239
on 21st Street?

1:27:44.239 --> 1:27:46.159
I've been to...

1:27:47.559 --> 1:27:48.959
that...

1:27:50.439 --> 1:27:52.159
I've been to that theater...

1:27:53.439 --> 1:27:56.239
three times in my life.

1:27:56.240 --> 1:27:58.359
What kind of movies
do they show there?

1:27:58.359 --> 1:28:00.759
Gay movies.

1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:03.039
Gay pornographic movies?

1:28:03.039 --> 1:28:04.959
Yes.

1:28:05.559 --> 1:28:07.159
Objection, Your Honor.

1:28:08.159 --> 1:28:12.359
Your Honor, this line of questioning
is vital to the issue of credibility.

1:28:13.639 --> 1:28:19.359
Let's see where this is going.
Continue, Counselor.

1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:23.959
Do men have sex with each other
in that theater?

1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:26.639
Some men.

1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:29.759
Have you ever had sex with anyone
in that theater?

1:28:30.439 --> 1:28:31.639
<i>I'm Robert. </i>

1:28:31.639 --> 1:28:33.759
Andy.

1:28:33.759 --> 1:28:35.639
Yes.

1:28:35.639 --> 1:28:37.559
Once.

1:28:37.639 --> 1:28:43.159
When? Approximately what year
did that event take place?

1:28:44.959 --> 1:28:49.279
I guess it was 1984.

1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:51.959
'84, '85.

1:28:51.959 --> 1:28:55.279
Were you aware in 1984, '85...

1:28:55.280 --> 1:28:58.479
that there was a fatal disease
out there called AIDS...

1:28:58.480 --> 1:29:02.359
and that you could contract it
through sexual activity?

1:29:03.559 --> 1:29:06.359
I'd heard of some...
I'd heard of a thing.

1:29:09.679 --> 1:29:12.759
The gay plague, the gay cancer.

1:29:12.759 --> 1:29:16.759
We didn't know
how you could get it...

1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:18.479
or that it killed you.

1:29:21.079 --> 1:29:23.079
Do you need a break, Mr. Beckett?

1:29:25.879 --> 1:29:28.959
No. I could use some water, though.

1:29:28.959 --> 1:29:32.359
John, would you
bring Mr. Beckett some water?

1:29:36.159 --> 1:29:38.879
While you were employed at Wyant,
Wheeler you did everything you could...

1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:43.879
to make sure no one knew
that you were an active homosexual.

1:29:43.880 --> 1:29:44.959
Correct?

1:29:45.079 --> 1:29:47.199
No.

1:29:47.199 --> 1:29:49.679
That's not correct.
I never lied about it.

1:29:57.279 --> 1:29:59.079
As a homosexual...

1:29:59.079 --> 1:30:04.399
one is often forced to conceal
one's sexuality.

1:30:04.400 --> 1:30:06.479
Isn't that right?

1:30:07.399 --> 1:30:08.799
In some circumstances, yes.

1:30:08.999 --> 1:30:12.479
Isn't it true you've spent your life
pretending to be something you're not...

1:30:12.480 --> 1:30:17.279
so much so that the art
of concealment and dishonesty...

1:30:17.280 --> 1:30:20.199
- has become second nature...
- Your Honor, I object!

1:30:20.199 --> 1:30:21.679
I'll withdraw it,
Your Honor.

1:30:22.879 --> 1:30:26.279
Mr. Beckett, were you living with...

1:30:26.280 --> 1:30:28.199
Miguel Alvarez...

1:30:28.199 --> 1:30:32.079
in 1984 or '85
when you had your...

1:30:33.479 --> 1:30:37.799
anonymous sexual encounter
in the porn theater?

1:30:38.879 --> 1:30:41.079
Yes.

1:30:41.999 --> 1:30:45.599
So you could have infected him,
isn't that right?

1:30:45.599 --> 1:30:48.399
Miguel has not been infected.

1:30:48.400 --> 1:30:50.119
You didn't answer my question.

1:30:50.119 --> 1:30:54.319
You could have infected Mr. Alvarez
at that time. Is that correct?

1:30:58.399 --> 1:31:00.199
Yes.

1:31:00.319 --> 1:31:02.799
You've testified that
the lesions on your face...

1:31:02.800 --> 1:31:06.199
were visible to the people
that you worked with, correct?

1:31:07.319 --> 1:31:08.719
That's right.

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:13.119
And you contend that when the partners
were made aware of the lesions...

1:31:13.120 --> 1:31:17.119
that they leapt to the conclusion
that you had AIDS and fired you.

1:31:17.120 --> 1:31:18.199
Is that correct?

1:31:20.599 --> 1:31:22.599
As painful as it is...

1:31:24.519 --> 1:31:27.519
to accuse my former colleagues...

1:31:27.519 --> 1:31:31.199
of such reprehensible behavior...

1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:34.799
it is the only conclusion
I could come to.

1:31:34.799 --> 1:31:38.799
Do you have any lesions
on your face at this time?

1:31:40.519 --> 1:31:43.199
One here...

1:31:43.199 --> 1:31:45.199
right by my ear.

1:31:47.999 --> 1:31:50.119
Your Honor,
may I approach the witness?

1:31:50.119 --> 1:31:51.639
Yes, you may.

1:32:03.439 --> 1:32:05.719
Remembering that
you're under oath...

1:32:05.719 --> 1:32:08.039
answering truthfully...

1:32:08.039 --> 1:32:12.039
can you see the lesions
on your face in this mirror...

1:32:12.040 --> 1:32:13.519
from three feet away?

1:32:13.519 --> 1:32:15.439
Answering truthfully.

1:32:24.439 --> 1:32:26.919
Well, l...
At the time I was fired...

1:32:26.920 --> 1:32:30.119
I had four lesions,
and they were much bigger.

1:32:30.119 --> 1:32:32.439
Could you answer
the question, please?

1:32:36.839 --> 1:32:40.319
Well, no.
No, I can't really see it.

1:32:44.119 --> 1:32:46.039
No more questions, Your Honor.

1:32:48.119 --> 1:32:51.359
This would be a good time
to break for today.

1:32:51.359 --> 1:32:54.839
- We can reconvene in the morning.
- I hate this case.

1:32:54.840 --> 1:32:58.239
Your Honor, may I have
five minutes in redirect?

1:32:59.159 --> 1:33:02.959
Mr. Beckett, can you go on
for five minutes?

1:33:02.960 --> 1:33:04.239
- Three minutes.
- Yes.

1:33:05.639 --> 1:33:07.559
May I borrow your mirror, please?

1:33:14.759 --> 1:33:18.959
Do you have any lesions on any part
of your body at this time...

1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:21.839
that resemble the lesions
you had on your face...

1:33:21.959 --> 1:33:23.839
at the time that you were fired?

1:33:23.839 --> 1:33:28.039
Yes. On my torso.

1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:30.759
Your torso.
If it please the court...

1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:33.559
I would like to ask Andrew
to remove his shirt...

1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:37.639
so that everyone could get an accurate
idea of what we're talking about.

1:33:37.640 --> 1:33:38.439
Objection.

1:33:38.439 --> 1:33:42.039
Your Honor, it would
unfairly influence the jury.

1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:46.359
Your Honor, if Andrew was forced to use
a wheelchair due to his illness...

1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:48.759
would the defense ask him
to park it outside...

1:33:48.759 --> 1:33:50.759
because it would
unfairly influence the jury?

1:33:50.879 --> 1:33:54.959
We're talking about AIDS, about lesions.
Let's see what we're talking about.

1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:57.559
I'll allow it.

1:33:57.559 --> 1:34:00.679
Mr. Beckett, would you please
remove your shirt?

1:34:11.359 --> 1:34:14.879
My God, what a nightmare!

1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:16.679
He asked for it.

1:34:59.279 --> 1:35:03.199
Can you see the lesions
on your chest in this mirror?

1:35:03.199 --> 1:35:04.599
Yes.

1:35:06.479 --> 1:35:07.879
Thank you.

1:35:17.399 --> 1:35:20.879
Do you swear to tell the whole truth,
so help you God?

1:35:20.879 --> 1:35:22.279
I do.

1:35:22.279 --> 1:35:24.199
Please be seated.

1:35:32.877 --> 1:35:37.396
Mr. Wheeler, were you aware
that Andrew Beckett...

1:35:37.397 --> 1:35:42.075
was suffering from AIDS at the time
of his departure from Wyant, Wheeler?

1:35:42.076 --> 1:35:45.394
- No.
- For absolute clarity...

1:35:45.395 --> 1:35:48.473
did you fire Andrew Beckett...

1:35:48.473 --> 1:35:50.673
because he had AIDS?

1:35:50.673 --> 1:35:55.791
No, I did not fire Andrew Beckett
because he had AIDS.

1:35:55.792 --> 1:36:00.710
Mr. Wheeler, can you explain,
in a way that leaves no doubt...

1:36:00.711 --> 1:36:02.110
why you promoted...

1:36:02.110 --> 1:36:04.709
Andrew Beckett through your firm?

1:36:04.709 --> 1:36:08.908
And then, most importantly...

1:36:08.909 --> 1:36:12.187
why you eventually
asked him to leave?

1:36:14.387 --> 1:36:17.706
If you're the owner
of a major league ball club...

1:36:17.706 --> 1:36:20.785
you recruit the hot rookie.

1:36:20.786 --> 1:36:26.504
And Andy was tremendously promising
as a young attorney.

1:36:26.505 --> 1:36:30.383
Fresh out of Penn.
Crackerjack.

1:36:30.384 --> 1:36:32.503
That's why we went after him.
That's why we hired him.

1:36:32.503 --> 1:36:37.101
And that's why we stuck with him
year after year.

1:36:38.381 --> 1:36:40.381
Why did you give him...

1:36:40.381 --> 1:36:43.100
opportunity after opportunity?

1:36:43.100 --> 1:36:46.579
Well, when you groom someone...

1:36:46.580 --> 1:36:50.578
the way we groomed Andy,
nurturing him...

1:36:50.578 --> 1:36:55.497
lavishing all kinds of
special treatment on him...

1:36:55.498 --> 1:36:57.616
you make quite an investment.

1:36:57.616 --> 1:37:02.095
We were waiting for the promise
to kick in and deliver.

1:37:02.096 --> 1:37:04.895
But ultimately
we could no longer...

1:37:04.896 --> 1:37:09.894
ignore the gap between
the reality and the promise.

1:37:16.212 --> 1:37:18.092
Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.

1:37:20.811 --> 1:37:23.010
No more questions
at this time, Your Honor.

1:37:23.010 --> 1:37:25.010
Mr. Miller?

1:37:27.009 --> 1:37:27.889
Objection!

1:37:27.889 --> 1:37:31.008
- Your Honor, objection.
- All right, Mr. Miller.

1:37:31.009 --> 1:37:35.407
- That'll be sufficient.
- Mr. Wheeler, you are magnificent.

1:37:35.408 --> 1:37:37.807
You are my hero.

1:37:37.808 --> 1:37:41.606
Andrew is right.
You are the greatest.

1:37:41.606 --> 1:37:43.006
Are you gay?

1:37:44.405 --> 1:37:46.805
Objection.

1:37:48.484 --> 1:37:49.884
How dare you!

1:37:49.884 --> 1:37:52.883
Witness will kindly answer.

1:37:55.723 --> 1:37:59.122
No, I am not a homosexual.

1:37:59.123 --> 1:38:01.401
Isn't it true that
when you realized...

1:38:01.401 --> 1:38:04.720
Andrew Beckett... your golden boy,
your future senior partner...

1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:06.720
was gay and had AIDS...

1:38:06.721 --> 1:38:10.919
it drove a stake of fear
right through your heterosexual heart?

1:38:10.920 --> 1:38:12.319
Remembering...

1:38:12.319 --> 1:38:16.118
all the hugs and handshakes,
the intimate moments in the sauna...

1:38:16.119 --> 1:38:19.197
the friendly pats on the backside
that you and Andrew exchanged...

1:38:19.198 --> 1:38:20.397
like guys exchange.

1:38:20.398 --> 1:38:24.996
It made you say, "My God!

1:38:24.997 --> 1:38:26.595
What does this say about me?"

1:38:26.595 --> 1:38:28.595
Objection, Your Honor.

1:38:31.194 --> 1:38:34.113
The witness will please
respond to the question.

1:38:35.913 --> 1:38:38.512
You may tap dance around me
all you wish...

1:38:38.513 --> 1:38:42.111
with your innuendoes
and locker room fantasies.

1:38:42.111 --> 1:38:45.591
But the truth still remains
that your client...

1:38:45.592 --> 1:38:47.790
worked when he wanted to work...

1:38:47.791 --> 1:38:52.309
telling us what he thought we needed
to know about who he really was.

1:38:52.310 --> 1:38:54.708
Andy insisted on bending the rules...

1:38:54.708 --> 1:38:59.507
and his work suffered tremendously
in the long run as a result of that.

1:38:59.508 --> 1:39:03.826
Explain this like I'm a six-year-old,
'cause I just don't get it.

1:39:03.827 --> 1:39:07.825
Who makes these rules that
you're talking about? You?

1:39:07.825 --> 1:39:13.024
Read your Bible, Mr. Miller,
Old and New Testament.

1:39:13.025 --> 1:39:15.223
Pretty valuable rules in there.

1:39:15.223 --> 1:39:17.223
Excuse me.

1:39:20.302 --> 1:39:22.502
Excuse... I can't...

1:39:26.821 --> 1:39:28.500
Excuse me!

1:39:28.501 --> 1:39:30.500
Christ's sakes, somebody get a doctor!

1:39:32.219 --> 1:39:35.419
What is it?
Turn over now.

1:39:35.419 --> 1:39:38.618
- Call an ambulance, please?
- Right away.

1:39:38.618 --> 1:39:41.817
An ambulance, please!
Let him breathe.

1:39:41.818 --> 1:39:44.496
Please make room for him.

1:39:47.496 --> 1:39:49.695
It's not working.

1:39:49.695 --> 1:39:51.415
- Please, sir!
- It's not working!

1:39:51.416 --> 1:39:54.014
- They know how to save him.
- It is making him worse!

1:39:57.133 --> 1:40:01.132
Did you notice any changes
whatsoever in Andrew's appearance...

1:40:01.133 --> 1:40:04.332
over the course of the year
leading up to his termination?

1:40:05.131 --> 1:40:08.011
Yes. I did.

1:40:08.011 --> 1:40:11.010
Were these changes for the better
or for the worse?

1:40:11.010 --> 1:40:15.329
Sometimes for the better,
but generally they were for the worse.

1:40:15.330 --> 1:40:19.608
Mr. Seidman, what did you think caused
these changes in Andy's appearance?

1:40:21.328 --> 1:40:23.807
I was afraid.

1:40:25.327 --> 1:40:27.526
I suspected Andy had AIDS.

1:40:28.726 --> 1:40:31.925
- Order.
- Thank you. Your witness.

1:40:31.926 --> 1:40:34.604
- Miss Conine?
- Mr. Seidman...

1:40:34.605 --> 1:40:37.804
did you share your suspicions
with Mr. Wheeler...

1:40:37.805 --> 1:40:41.723
or any of the other managing partners
at any time...

1:40:41.724 --> 1:40:44.922
before the decision
to fire Andrew Beckett was made?

1:40:44.922 --> 1:40:47.201
No. I didn't.

1:40:47.201 --> 1:40:49.521
I didn't mention it to anyone...

1:40:49.521 --> 1:40:51.400
not even Andy.

1:40:51.400 --> 1:40:53.840
I didn't even give him a chance
to talk about it.

1:40:56.519 --> 1:40:59.318
And I think
I'm going to regret that...

1:40:59.319 --> 1:41:01.518
for as long as I live.

1:41:01.518 --> 1:41:04.717
- Any more questions, Miss Conine?
- That's all, Your Honor.

1:41:04.717 --> 1:41:09.516
<i>They are sayin'he wasn't
a good lawyer. He was mediocre. </i>

1:41:09.517 --> 1:41:14.435
And the fact that they gave him the most
important lawsuit they ever had...

1:41:14.436 --> 1:41:16.434
for one of their most
important clients...

1:41:16.435 --> 1:41:21.033
They say that doesn't prove anything
because that was just a test.

1:41:21.034 --> 1:41:24.033
- What'd they call it? A carrot?
- Yeah. "What's up, Doc?"

1:41:24.034 --> 1:41:28.112
To see if he'd rise to the occasion.
Okay.

1:41:28.113 --> 1:41:31.031
Say I gotta send a pilot
into enemy territory...

1:41:31.032 --> 1:41:34.110
and he's gonna be flyin' a plane
that costs $350 million.

1:41:35.510 --> 1:41:38.109
Who am I gonna put in that plane?

1:41:38.109 --> 1:41:43.228
Some rookie who can't cut it so
I can see if he is up to the challenge?

1:41:43.229 --> 1:41:47.227
Or am I gonna give that assignment
to my best pilot...

1:41:47.228 --> 1:41:50.226
my sharpest, my most experienced,
my top gun...

1:41:50.226 --> 1:41:52.706
the very best I got?

1:41:52.707 --> 1:41:55.145
I just don't get that.

1:41:55.705 --> 1:41:58.344
Would somebody please
explain it to me...

1:41:59.824 --> 1:42:01.823
like I'm a six-year-old?

1:42:03.423 --> 1:42:06.222
<i>- Juror number six?
- I agree. </i>

1:42:06.222 --> 1:42:09.222
<i>- Juror number seven?
- I agree. </i>

1:42:11.421 --> 1:42:13.821
<i>- Juror number nine?
- I agree. </i>

1:42:13.821 --> 1:42:16.020
Juror number ten?

1:42:16.020 --> 1:42:18.939
- I disagree.
- Juror number 11?

1:42:18.939 --> 1:42:21.539
- I agree.
- Juror number 12?

1:42:21.539 --> 1:42:23.738
Agree.

1:42:23.738 --> 1:42:25.618
Have you awarded any damages?

1:42:26.617 --> 1:42:29.017
Yes, Your Honor, we have.

1:42:29.017 --> 1:42:34.536
For back pay and loss of benefits
we award $143,000.

1:42:34.537 --> 1:42:39.015
For mental anguish and humiliation
we award $100,000.

1:42:39.016 --> 1:42:43.014
And for punitive damages
we award $4, 782,000.

1:42:48.132 --> 1:42:50.332
You may record the verdict.

1:42:51.132 --> 1:42:54.331
Everyone remain seated
until the jury is removed.

1:42:54.331 --> 1:42:56.450
How could they do that?

1:42:59.929 --> 1:43:02.329
This trial is now concluded.

1:43:06.448 --> 1:43:08.048
Congratulations!

1:43:09.047 --> 1:43:11.727
We'll strain ourselves
getting a reversal on this one.

1:43:11.727 --> 1:43:14.126
- We'll get started in the morning.
- Well, that's that.

1:43:14.126 --> 1:43:18.125
Congratulations, Mr. Miller.
I'll see you at the appeal.

1:43:18.126 --> 1:43:20.045
Congratulations.
Well done.

1:43:22.644 --> 1:43:26.043
Oh, man.
Thanks a lot.

1:43:26.044 --> 1:43:28.243
- I'll see ya at the hospital.
- Okay.

1:43:35.921 --> 1:43:37.840
Oh, Mr. Miller.
Hi. How you doin'?

1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:39.720
- You know where the room is?
- Down the hall.

1:43:39.720 --> 1:43:42.439
- Right there.
- The one off...

1:43:42.439 --> 1:43:43.719
Thanks.

1:43:45.119 --> 1:43:47.838
If he leaves the hospital,
which is unlikely...

1:43:47.839 --> 1:43:52.237
don't expect him to be
remotely like he was before this crisis.

1:43:52.917 --> 1:43:55.636
He's lost the vision
in his right eye...

1:43:55.637 --> 1:43:59.435
and because of the C. M. V.
He will not regain his vision.

1:44:00.155 --> 1:44:05.154
- Next door, to the right.
- The C. M. V. Has ravaged his body.

1:44:12.032 --> 1:44:13.752
Hi. Congratulations.

1:44:13.832 --> 1:44:15.431
Hey. Way to go.

1:44:15.431 --> 1:44:17.351

1:44:24.629 --> 1:44:26.349
Hey, Joe.

1:44:27.348 --> 1:44:30.428
We are so grateful to you.
You were wonderful. Thank you so much.

1:44:30.429 --> 1:44:32.347
- Can I take that for you?
- Yeah. I brought some...

1:44:32.427 --> 1:44:36.826
- Oh, wonderful.
- Cheese and stuff.

1:44:59.741 --> 1:45:01.340
How ya doin'?

1:45:11.858 --> 1:45:14.937
What do you call

1:45:14.938 --> 1:45:17.536
chained together
at the bottom of the ocean?

1:45:18.456 --> 1:45:20.456
I don't know.

1:45:20.456 --> 1:45:22.655
A good start.

1:45:32.133 --> 1:45:34.252
Excellent work, Counselor.

1:45:36.932 --> 1:45:38.851
I thank you.

1:45:39.731 --> 1:45:42.131

1:45:42.131 --> 1:45:44.130
Counselor.

1:46:15.243 --> 1:46:17.042
I'd better go.

1:46:20.041 --> 1:46:22.241
Yeah. Sure thing.

1:46:23.641 --> 1:46:25.160
I'll see you later?

1:46:29.239 --> 1:46:31.559
Thanks for stopping by.

1:46:34.638 --> 1:46:36.238
I'll see you again.

1:46:45.755 --> 1:46:47.635
I'll keep it on ice for you.

1:46:50.954 --> 1:46:52.434
See you.

1:46:52.554 --> 1:46:54.433
I just want to say thank you.

1:46:59.152 --> 1:47:01.951
We really appreciate it.
We'll see you again?

1:47:10.469 --> 1:47:12.749
He's a fighter.

1:47:12.749 --> 1:47:14.868
We just want to get him home.

1:47:17.148 --> 1:47:18.547
Thank you, Joe.

1:47:45.541 --> 1:47:50.140
What do you call a thousand lawyers
chained at the bottom of the ocean?

1:47:50.141 --> 1:47:53.259
- A good start?
- Very amusing.

1:47:55.259 --> 1:47:57.778

Okay?

1:48:09.575 --> 1:48:11.455

Come on, sweetheart.

1:48:59.843 --> 1:49:04.562

It's okay. Don't worry about it.
