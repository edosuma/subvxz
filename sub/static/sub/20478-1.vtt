<i>There isn't always a loud bang</i>

00:45.712 --> 00:48.006
<i>when a dream bursts.</i>

00:48.924 --> 00:51.426
<i>But that's how it was with us.</i>

00:52.261 --> 00:53.845
<i>Paladiki.</i>

00:54.012 --> 00:56.265
<i>Galapagos in Greece.</i>

00:56.431 --> 00:59.601
<i>The path out of the crisis
for our little island</i>

00:59.768 --> 01:01.520
<i>ends here.</i>

01:01.687 --> 01:05.857
<i>But at least it's a good story.</i>

01:06.024 --> 01:09.444
<i>And even if I play
only a small part in it,</i>

01:09.861 --> 01:13.657
<i>I consider it my duty to tell it.</i>

01:24.543 --> 01:27.129
<i>Let's start from the beginning.</i>

01:27.963 --> 01:31.008
<i>Paladiki is a quiet island.</i>

01:31.174 --> 01:33.218
<i>Heavenly quiet.</i>

01:33.385 --> 01:36.346
<i>"Galapagos in Greece".
That's our project.</i>

01:37.723 --> 01:41.602
<i>Instead of big hotels and mass tourism,</i>

01:41.852 --> 01:43.979
<i>we have nature.</i>

01:44.146 --> 01:46.898
<i>We have mountains,
we have donkeys,</i>

01:47.065 --> 01:49.151
<i>we have a hospital,</i>

01:49.401 --> 01:52.070
<i>the sea,
a beautiful beach, and...</i>

01:52.863 --> 01:54.615
<i>a whole bunch of goats.</i>

01:56.783 --> 02:01.663
<i>But in this story,
it's more about what we don't have.</i>

02:02.456 --> 02:04.833
<i>The whole catastrophe</i>

02:05.083 --> 02:07.753
<i>starts with a little piece of paper...</i>

02:21.224 --> 02:23.894
- Hello, Panos.
- Good morning, Brigitte, my dear.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.229
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.065
One euro for you, Darling.

02:29.441 --> 02:32.444
- Are you with my girlfriend?
- You're a jerk.

02:32.611 --> 02:36.073
- Are you going out tonight?
- Let's see what the evening brings.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.367
- But we're leaving tomorrow.
- Yeah.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.079
You want to break my heart.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.214
What the hell is this?
Those arrogant arseholes!

02:52.464 --> 02:54.341
- Come on.
- I hate the Germans!

02:54.925 --> 02:57.386
But Panes, you're German yourself.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.847
Me?
I'm a victim of globalisation.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.184
Born and raised
in a foreign country.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.311
But in my heart, in my blood,

03:06.812 --> 03:09.022
I was and still am a Greek!

03:10.732 --> 03:12.025
Morning, Yannis.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.027
How's it going?

03:23.286 --> 03:24.579
Hello.

03:25.664 --> 03:29.501
- I want to work for you!
- You're too young, come back in ten years.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.135
Eighteen!
I'll be eighteen by then!

03:44.599 --> 03:47.602
<i>For our project "Galapagos in Greece",</i>

03:47.769 --> 03:51.440
<i>we took out a small loan from Germany.</i>

03:51.606 --> 03:54.651
<i>We received our money,
everything was going well,</i>

03:54.818 --> 03:56.653
<i>and now this!</i>

03:56.820 --> 04:02.701
<i>"A supplemental extraordinary
examination of the specified securities."</i>

04:02.868 --> 04:06.455
<i>In other words:
The German is coming to snoop around.</i>

04:06.621 --> 04:07.998
Do you see anything?

04:08.165 --> 04:10.542
Wait, the ship hasn't even docked yet.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.711
Give them to me!

04:16.673 --> 04:17.757
Oh, no!

04:18.007 --> 04:20.218
My girls!
I completely forgot about them!

04:20.385 --> 04:22.179
My darlings! I'm up here!

04:22.345 --> 04:24.681
Sit down, you idiot.
Our island is in jeopardy!

04:24.848 --> 04:26.475
Forgive me!

04:28.643 --> 04:31.772
Odysseus, you have to let them go.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.525
Here we go.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.736
Give them to me.

05:05.514 --> 05:09.267
Only a German would do
what those two idiots ask.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.610
Hello! You must be from Germany.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.695
Welcome to Paladiki.
My name's Maria.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.615
- We have rooms for rent.
- No, thanks.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.992
Our hotel has a beautiful sea view.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.161
-25 euros per night.
- No,no.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.413
-20 euros?
- No.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.877
Pep Guardiola.

06:30.432 --> 06:33.393
<i>- Hello, Dr Laichinger.
- Geissner? What's the situation?</i>

06:33.560 --> 06:36.730
Well, it looks pretty miserable here.

06:36.980 --> 06:40.275
<i>- I'm looking for</i> my <i>hotel.
- No false sympathies.</i>

06:40.442 --> 06:43.570
<i>I'll bet there is neither a hospital
nor a power plant.</i>

06:43.737 --> 06:46.364
<i>- Stay on it!
-Of course, Dr Laichinger.</i>

06:58.084 --> 07:00.295
I don't believe it!

07:03.673 --> 07:05.550
Iast week.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.720
- He drowned!
- Yes.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.101
Hello?

07:15.769 --> 07:17.270
Hello!

07:18.229 --> 07:21.066
Excuse me? Excuse me!

07:21.524 --> 07:25.779
I'd like to take up your offer
of a room after all.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.490
Oh, yes! With pleasure.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.452
-It's 40 euros per room.
-40?

07:32.702 --> 07:35.080
The one for 2O is no longer available,

07:35.330 --> 07:39.167
but you can use
all the hotel's facilities

07:39.417 --> 07:41.169
free of charge.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.164
<i>- Hello, Dr Laichinger.
- Geissner, what's the progress?</i>

08:18.331 --> 08:21.376
<i>- I'm at the</i> hotel now...
<i>- Only now? What took you so long?</i>

08:21.543 --> 08:23.753
- I had to find a different place.
- Geissner?

08:24.004 --> 08:27.173
<i>- Our investor needs that beach, and quick.
-Just a moment...</i>

08:27.757 --> 08:33.554
Excuse me, but would it be impolite
to ask you for the money for the room now?

08:33.929 --> 08:36.390
Excuse me,
but I'm on the phone right now.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.684
Pardon me.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.979
Unbelievable, the state of things here.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.440
<i>Give me proof
that the securities are false.</i>

08:43.606 --> 08:44.983
Certainly, Dr Laichinger.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.360
<i>- Geissner, stay on it.
-Yes.</i>

08:51.281 --> 08:54.909
Listen, I would really appreciate
a bit more privacy.

08:55.410 --> 08:59.247
Of course! Would it be impolite
to ask you once more...

08:59.497 --> 09:01.499
Yes!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.002
All right.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.297
I'll need a proper receipt
showing the VAT separately.

09:07.464 --> 09:10.925
- If you know what I mean.
- Of course. Thank you.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.655
Here comes the gauleiter.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.785
He wants his money back!

09:44.250 --> 09:46.795
Finally! The Germans are here!

09:48.046 --> 09:50.673
Yes. Jérg Geissner, from the AVO Bank.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.759
Our saviour from Germany!

09:52.926 --> 09:55.386
What would we do without you?

09:56.763 --> 09:59.766
Would you be so kind
and tell me where the mayor's office is?

10:00.016 --> 10:03.603
But of course, Herr Kommissar.
This way.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.523
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

10:06.689 --> 10:09.192
- You've been to Greece before, right?
- No,no.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.278
- And I'm not a Kommissar, either.
- This way.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.656
- Welcome!
- Welcome, welcome!

10:16.449 --> 10:19.327
Please excuse the chaos,

10:19.494 --> 10:24.791
to increase efficiency we've merged
several administrative departments:

10:24.958 --> 10:27.460
Tax and revenue office,
registration office,

10:27.627 --> 10:30.380
property and land, uh...

10:30.630 --> 10:33.341
- What's it called, regis...
- Registry.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.927
Yes, land registry, etc. etc.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.929
Bureaucracy reduction, you know.

10:38.096 --> 10:41.432
But excuse me,
I've not even introduced myself.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.269
I'm the Mayor of Paladiki.

10:44.435 --> 10:47.021
Kantelirakis, Spyros.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.653
Oh... how convenient.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.197
Geissner, AVO Bank.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.867
Yes, I've been sent...

10:59.033 --> 11:00.910
- Please.
- Thank you.

11:01.077 --> 11:06.077
I've been sent to examine the securities
you listed for the loan we granted you...

11:06.082 --> 11:07.500
I've been sent to examine the securities
you listed for the loan we granted you...

11:07.667 --> 11:11.254
The securities I refer to
would be, hold on...

11:12.088 --> 11:17.427
the electric power plant,
the hospital and the beach.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.887
Gladly.

11:19.053 --> 11:22.348
Our project,
"Paladiki. Galapagos in Greece",

11:22.599 --> 11:26.102
is making great progress.
Thanks to you!

11:26.728 --> 11:29.230
So what exactly can I do for you?

11:29.397 --> 11:34.777
I need more detailed information
about the power plant and the hospital.

11:34.944 --> 11:38.656
In other words,
construction plans, invoices,

11:39.365 --> 11:42.118
land register extracts...

11:42.577 --> 11:44.704
Whatever else you might...

11:52.795 --> 11:57.133
No problem, that was just
my cousin's tax return.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.473
In this context,
I need to inform you

12:03.723 --> 12:06.517
of the consequences
of making false statements.

12:08.436 --> 12:12.941
In such a case, the AVO Bank
would have the right by contract

12:15.276 --> 12:18.988
to choose the securities
on its own...

12:22.325 --> 12:24.744
which in this case, would...

12:25.787 --> 12:27.330
affect...

12:27.830 --> 12:30.333
the town of Paladiki...

12:31.000 --> 12:32.710
as a whole.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.466
Please, my friend.

12:39.133 --> 12:43.846
I know, you Germans
have a very different mentality.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.723
As a Greek,

12:45.890 --> 12:48.101
I would say you are snooping around,

12:48.351 --> 12:51.145
- I'd say you don't trust us.
- No,no.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.940
In that regard, you're just...

12:54.107 --> 12:57.318
different.
I accept that.

13:00.154 --> 13:03.825
It would be best if you yourself
look for what you need.

13:03.992 --> 13:07.829
Unfortunately, due to budget cuts,
I had to fire my secretary.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.374
But that would take me months!

13:11.541 --> 13:13.835
Yes, you'll like it here with us.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.671
In that case,
I'll inspect the buildings straight away,

13:16.838 --> 13:19.340
to get a personal impression
on the ground.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.468
I wanted to look at the beach anyway.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.680
Of course, be my guest.
You can walk to the beach,

13:25.847 --> 13:27.849
just walk along the harbour...

13:30.852 --> 13:35.481
And how do I get to the power plant
and the hospital?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.776
Car rental and maps
can be found at the Mini Market.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.696
But they only rent cars until 4:00 pm.

13:41.863 --> 13:44.198
You won't make it today.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.659
Enjoy Paladiki, Herr Kommissar.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.708
<i>Dr Laichinger. Mailbox.
Leave a message.</i>

13:54.917 --> 13:57.587
Dr Laichinger, this is Geissner.

13:57.754 --> 14:01.799
I don't think I'll find a hospital
or a power plant here.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.887
Thank God there's a beach, at least.
Our investor will like it.

14:06.137 --> 14:09.223
Big enough for the hotel
and the water sports facilities.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.934
It needs some cosmetic surgery,

14:12.101 --> 14:15.563
but with a little fresh sand,
and a palm or two, it'll be great.

14:16.189 --> 14:21.277
The town's harbour is ideal
for restaurants and a shopping strip,

14:21.444 --> 14:23.154
although there might be...

14:23.905 --> 14:27.116
some resistance
from the population,

14:27.575 --> 14:30.995
because of the project
"Galapagos in Greece"...

14:32.830 --> 14:34.082
Oh God!

14:34.332 --> 14:37.168
What happened?
I don't believe it.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.255
There... look!
I don't believe it.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.591
Don't you trip me up! Got it?

14:43.841 --> 14:47.428
Got it, you stupid thing?
Where does it come from?

14:47.678 --> 14:49.180
Where? Where?

14:50.181 --> 14:52.475
I don't speak Greek.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.436
You're cute...
You don't understand a word,

14:55.686 --> 14:57.730
and don't speak a word.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.488
Thank you.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.449
Jérg. Jérg Geissner.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.867
Shit!

15:12.787 --> 15:14.997
Sorry, Mrs Laichinger?

15:15.164 --> 15:18.251
That was an accident, but...

15:18.418 --> 15:21.838
I'm doing fine.
I'll call again later.

15:25.383 --> 15:29.345
<i>What Paladiki also has
is an undersea power cable.</i>

15:29.512 --> 15:31.180
<i>15 centimetres thick,</i>

15:31.347 --> 15:36.102
<i>it runs 260 kilometres
across the seabed to the mainland,</i>

15:36.269 --> 15:39.105
<i>supplying us with electricity.</i>

15:39.355 --> 15:41.399
<i>That's the good news.</i>

15:41.566 --> 15:43.109
<i>The bad news is:</i>

15:43.276 --> 15:46.779
<i>An undersea cable
is not an electric power plant.</i>

15:46.946 --> 15:49.449
<i>Which has never been
a problem until now.</i>

15:49.615 --> 15:53.411
That's why we need a power plant!

16:14.974 --> 16:18.269
Bye, you nutcase.
And keep the whiskers.

16:18.436 --> 16:21.189
- The what?
- Your beard. Keep it.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.107
Okay.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.032
- Can you turn the sign around?
- This here?

16:35.828 --> 16:37.622
Hi there!

16:44.545 --> 16:46.881
Good morning.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.009
Morning.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.848
- Didn't I see you at Mr Kante...
- Kantelirakis.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.101
- Right. Didn't I see you there?
-It's possible.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.687
Yes, I'm quite sure of it.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.190
Anyway, I'd like to rent a car.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.278
I don't rent out cars anymore.
I'm sorry.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.865
But I have a good alternative.

17:15.742 --> 17:18.913
This is where we are.
And that's where you have to go.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.707
You're kidding, right?

17:22.165 --> 17:23.917
You'll love it.

17:25.752 --> 17:28.673
I'm not going to ride around
on a donkey!

17:28.839 --> 17:31.342
Why not? Just try it.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.225
This is to go right,
that's to go left.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.895
4O for the donkey
and 5 for the map.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.066
We'll take care of it later.
Good luck.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.849
- You think this will work?
- It will.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.393
We'll start work today.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.733
Damned goats!

18:29.525 --> 18:32.945
Which idiot brought those animals
to our island?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.364
Those animals are subsidised!

18:35.531 --> 18:37.408
They finance the island!

18:38.117 --> 18:41.746
- You mean like the power plant?
- Leave me alone!

18:43.414 --> 18:45.082
Say...

18:46.000 --> 18:49.879
Can you keep the German spy
away from here for a few days?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.842
That's the least of our problems.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.804
Right. Right. Right!

18:59.221 --> 19:01.307
Stop! Stop!

19:03.267 --> 19:05.269
Stop! Stop!

19:07.897 --> 19:09.649
Oh, God. Hang on.

19:21.243 --> 19:24.538
<i>- Hello, Dr Laichinger.
- Geissner, where are you?</i>

19:25.581 --> 19:28.167
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, what's the situation?</i>

19:28.334 --> 19:31.087
- Why are you whispering?
- I can't <i>speak</i> openly.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.463
I see.

19:32.630 --> 19:35.007
<i>- But you don't have to whisper.
-That's right.</i>

19:35.257 --> 19:38.052
<i>- So, what's the situation?
- Yes,</i> uh...

19:38.219 --> 19:43.140
To be honest, right now
things are going a bit slowly.

19:43.307 --> 19:46.310
We're having
some transportation problems.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.813
<i>I hope they haven't sent you off
on a donkey!</i>

19:50.106 --> 19:53.192
It's not that bad.
I can't ride anyway.

19:54.276 --> 19:58.322
But today I might not
be able to visit both...

19:58.489 --> 20:02.201
<i>- The situation is serious!
-I know it's serious.</i>

20:02.368 --> 20:05.705
<i>- Stay on it, Geissner.
-Yes, I'll stay on it, Dr...</i>

20:10.418 --> 20:12.294
Damn it!

20:14.964 --> 20:18.050
When I say right, I mean right!

20:18.718 --> 20:21.137
You think I'll let you make a fool of me?

20:21.303 --> 20:22.722
Damn it!

20:24.890 --> 20:26.517
Come back.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.186
Come back!

20:35.025 --> 20:37.445
Vassilis, bring two buckets of water.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.288
Come here.

20:47.455 --> 20:50.291
- He found his own way back.
- Good animal, right?

20:52.710 --> 20:55.379
Did you take a walk with the German?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.025
Cheers!

21:17.818 --> 21:19.737
Can I get something to eat here too?

21:19.904 --> 21:22.198
Vassilis, the speciality of the house.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.992
You'll like it.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.831
How was your day, my friend?
Did you find everything?

21:33.501 --> 21:36.545
Why not spare ourselves
this whole charade,

21:36.712 --> 21:39.965
and you tell me straight out
that you have neither a power station

21:40.216 --> 21:42.051
nor a hospital?

21:42.218 --> 21:44.804
- Oh, Herr Kommissar!
- I'm not a Kommissar.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.181
How nice to have you here with us.

21:47.348 --> 21:50.935
What would we have done
without you Germans? Thank you.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.687
Thank you. Thank you.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.648
He won't hold out much longer!

21:55.815 --> 21:58.442
He can hardly wait
to get back on his ferry.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.159
<i>Bon appétit!</i>

22:07.952 --> 22:11.205
- Don't worry, it's all organic.
- The eye is particularly tasty.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.666
Go on.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.322
My apologies, please.

22:45.489 --> 22:48.242
We don't like it
when the Germans send their watchdogs.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.537
Why are you whispering?

22:52.913 --> 22:55.332
I have a little problem with the owner.

22:55.499 --> 22:58.127
It's better she doesn't know I'm here.

23:03.424 --> 23:06.051
It's not your fault.
You're just doing your job.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.929
No, I love my job.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.515
Panos!

23:12.474 --> 23:13.851
Panos!

23:14.018 --> 23:16.562
Panos! Open the door!

23:16.729 --> 23:19.481
I know you're in there.
Open up or I'll kick the door in!

23:19.648 --> 23:20.774
Is Daddy in there?

23:20.941 --> 23:24.069
Stop calling that idiot "Daddy"!
What a great dad!

23:24.737 --> 23:27.031
Leave my customers alone!
Do you understand?

23:27.197 --> 23:30.159
You'll sorely regret
having set foot in my hotel!

23:30.367 --> 23:31.952
Good evening.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.579
Do you have a visitor?

23:34.663 --> 23:37.291
- No.
- I'll give you some advice.

23:37.458 --> 23:40.044
Stay away from that man.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.838
Good night.

23:44.173 --> 23:48.719
Cursed is the day I ever met you!
You bloody bastard!

23:48.886 --> 23:52.556
If you think you can do us harm,
you can think again!

23:52.806 --> 23:56.018
Understood? Leave us in peace
and go back to Germany!

23:56.185 --> 24:00.022
If I catch you,
I'll beat you to a pulp!

24:00.189 --> 24:03.484
I'll break all your bones,
you randy goat!

24:03.651 --> 24:05.361
You dirty bastard!

24:05.611 --> 24:08.405
- He's gone.
- Good.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.223
Oh, it's cold!

25:22.312 --> 25:23.981
Cold. Cold.

25:42.750 --> 25:46.336
What's this? Get off me!

25:48.922 --> 25:52.509
What's going on? Get off me!

28:29.666 --> 28:31.543
What the hell are you doing there?

28:33.962 --> 28:37.549
- You scared me to death!
- Sorry, I didn't mean to.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.928
- All right, come in.
- Thanks.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.723
What happened to your eye?

28:51.355 --> 28:53.190
Can't you sleep?

28:54.024 --> 28:57.361
Yes, I can.
I just went for a little walk.

28:57.819 --> 29:00.697
You mean you were snooping around,
Herr Kommissar?

29:00.864 --> 29:02.241
Very funny.

29:02.491 --> 29:06.954
Seriously. Tomorrow I'm going
to the hospital. You can come along.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.581
- Really?
- Or you could take the donkey.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.166
No!

29:15.045 --> 29:20.008
You wouldn't happen to have
sleeping pills, would you?

29:21.510 --> 29:23.011
Sleeping pills?

29:30.227 --> 29:33.480
This, and peace in your heart,
is the best sleep tonic.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.859
And by the way,

29:38.610 --> 29:40.028
thanks for hiding me.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.615
Thanks for the salad.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.207
Do you have a wife in Germany?

29:54.042 --> 29:56.461
- I live alone.
- Bravo!

29:56.628 --> 29:59.256
It's best for a man to live alone.

30:00.007 --> 30:01.675
Let's drink to that.

30:07.723 --> 30:10.100
Take Odysseus...

30:10.267 --> 30:13.228
He knew exactly what to do
when the Sirens tempted him.

30:13.395 --> 30:16.940
He tied himself to the mast of his ship
to remain a free man.

30:20.694 --> 30:22.404
Here.

30:25.657 --> 30:29.786
You know, around here
they call me "Kamaki".

30:30.287 --> 30:33.206
The Harpoon.
Because I've loved them all.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.667
I met women every summer.

30:36.376 --> 30:40.714
Women from England, Australia,
Switzerland, Germany. Yeah!

30:40.964 --> 30:43.050
Especially from Germany!

30:43.216 --> 30:45.844
From Denmark, Sweden, England,

30:46.386 --> 30:48.722
from France, from Switzerland!

30:50.557 --> 30:53.185
- Luxembourg.
- Yes, exactly, from Luxembourg!

30:53.435 --> 30:55.187
Come on.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.650
From Finland.
Did I say Finland already?

31:00.901 --> 31:02.527
Probably.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.615
What kind of women make you happy?

31:11.661 --> 31:13.538
My job makes me happy.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.002
Wait a second.
This is beautiful!

31:20.545 --> 31:21.630
Come on!

31:21.880 --> 31:24.257
Drink up!
Come on, drink up!

31:24.424 --> 31:27.302
Do you want to insult me?
All right, then.

32:20.230 --> 32:23.775
Get off. You're not supposed
to lie down on the bed!

33:29.799 --> 33:31.384
<i>- Geissnef!
- Good morn...</i>

33:31.551 --> 33:32.969
<i>Hello'?</i>

33:33.678 --> 33:35.472
<i>Geissner, is that you?</i>

33:40.852 --> 33:42.312
Good morning.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.439
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Pep!

34:00.372 --> 34:04.292
- Sorry I'm late.
- Ah, my friend! Did you sleep well?

34:05.043 --> 34:07.379
It was a fun night, wasn't it?

34:12.842 --> 34:15.178
Don't you have any wall plugs?

34:15.344 --> 34:18.181
Wall plugs are for Germans.
Greeks use nails.

34:22.476 --> 34:23.812
The Great Odysseus.

34:26.648 --> 34:30.694
- But you have to use a wall plug.
- Oh, come on. I don't use those things.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.321
Let's drive to the hospital.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.661
Fuck it. Come on, let's go.

34:44.623 --> 34:47.585
I don't ride motorcycles
out of principle.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.045
Motorcycle or donkey?

34:53.382 --> 34:55.510
What's going on now?

34:56.719 --> 34:58.555
Vassili, yeah!

34:59.723 --> 35:03.226
- That's going to be our artificial reef!
- Artificial reef?

35:05.186 --> 35:07.897
But that was a good boat,
it could've still been used!

35:08.064 --> 35:10.859
Yeah, but that's exactly
what we don't want anymore.

35:11.026 --> 35:14.487
They're trawlers.
They scrape everything from the seabed.

35:14.738 --> 35:18.033
Fish, mussels, coral, everything.
Then nothing else can grow.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.077
But that's over now.

35:21.328 --> 35:23.705
What we are planning here is called...

35:23.955 --> 35:26.166
"gentle tourism".

35:26.916 --> 35:27.792
Yeah!

35:33.214 --> 35:35.842
Can you hold this for a second, my friend?

35:50.148 --> 35:52.233
Two lovebirds!

35:52.400 --> 35:54.069
What a catch!

35:54.235 --> 35:56.738
You really caught something this time!

36:11.002 --> 36:13.004
What are you doing there the whole time?

36:13.838 --> 36:15.465
Just relax, man.

36:23.890 --> 36:27.185
Look at that!
Beautiful, isn't it?

36:28.103 --> 36:30.689
- Better than on a donkey, right?
- Yes.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.632
What is it?

37:01.177 --> 37:02.971
Can you get off?

37:03.763 --> 37:06.099
- Why?
-It's broken.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.184
What?

37:08.351 --> 37:11.062
It'll only take half an hour.
It happens all the time.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.251
Okay, half an hour is up!

38:00.028 --> 38:02.030
Oh, come on!

38:17.086 --> 38:19.172
Are you kidding me?

38:20.298 --> 38:22.300
I'm not an idiot!

38:24.594 --> 38:27.347
Next time I'm leaving this behind!

38:32.310 --> 38:34.062
Oh man!

38:48.201 --> 38:50.411
I don't believe it.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.043
Stop!

38:58.002 --> 39:00.129
Amateur actors.

39:03.550 --> 39:07.303
Out of the way!
It's a funeral, man! Unbelievable!

39:14.769 --> 39:16.145
Holy shit.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.899
Hello.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.736
Good bye. Uh...

39:26.281 --> 39:28.867
The guy's driving me crazy.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.334
My condolences.

39:47.969 --> 39:50.889
Well, well, it's Herr Kommissar!

39:55.393 --> 39:57.937
- What happened?
- A drowning.

39:58.605 --> 40:00.857
Does that happen here often?
How awful.

40:01.024 --> 40:03.985
- Have a seat. Want a coffee?
- No, nothing. Although...

40:04.152 --> 40:06.571
some water would be nice.

40:08.281 --> 40:10.658
Nikos, bring our friend a glass of water.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.578
Thanks for carrying that.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.300
His brother drowned last year as well.

40:28.468 --> 40:30.094
What?

40:30.261 --> 40:32.096
Maybe... Thanks.

40:32.263 --> 40:35.767
Maybe you should start thinking about
a lifeguard or a beach patrol.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.560
What?

40:37.727 --> 40:39.354
What did you say, damn it?

40:39.604 --> 40:42.023
- What is it, Vangelis?
- He didn't mean it.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.025
You take our land, our children!

40:44.275 --> 40:46.194
Calm down, Vangelis!

40:46.361 --> 40:48.780
- What was that?
- Sit down, Vangelis!

40:48.947 --> 40:50.782
I'm sorry, but what did I say?

40:50.949 --> 40:53.701
- Panos, what's going on?
- Everything's fine, Mayor.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.913
You know, the crisis...

40:58.414 --> 41:01.209
It's not like the people here
are drowning by accident.

41:14.347 --> 41:16.099
-"Syggnomi".
- Pardon me?

41:18.685 --> 41:20.311
Syggfiomi.

41:31.614 --> 41:33.658
Can I get a couple more of those?

41:34.909 --> 41:36.619
Nikos, wine!

41:39.372 --> 41:40.748
It's all right.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.167
He didn't mean it.
It's all right.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.309
Get some paint on there!

42:02.270 --> 42:05.148
Can't you see
how uneven that coat of paint is?

42:05.314 --> 42:08.484
- You never use enough paint!
- Make sure it's an even coat!

42:08.651 --> 42:10.695
Stop talking!
Enough already!

42:10.862 --> 42:12.905
No sloppy work!
Do good work, please!

42:13.906 --> 42:15.366
-$hut up!
-$hut up!

42:15.616 --> 42:18.911
It has to be perfect
when the German shows up!

42:19.078 --> 42:22.290
Perfect! Clean! impeccable!

42:22.540 --> 42:25.460
- You just sit around while we work!
- Unbelievable...

42:26.210 --> 42:27.754
Watch out!

42:30.882 --> 42:32.467
Dimitri!

42:39.098 --> 42:41.976
- Why aren't you sleeping?
- I was sleeping!

42:43.561 --> 42:45.480
What's going on?

42:45.646 --> 42:48.066
Let me in,
I have something to tell the German.

42:48.316 --> 42:49.817
- Wait, I'll get Mum.
- No!

42:50.068 --> 42:52.028
No, not Mum!

42:52.278 --> 42:55.114
Dimitri, I need your help, my boy.

42:59.660 --> 43:03.372
Even the Germans couldn't be worse.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.460
- It hurts!
-It's nothing serious.

43:08.211 --> 43:11.631
It's sprained... if not worse!

43:13.424 --> 43:16.052
If you can move it,
then everything's fine.

43:16.219 --> 43:18.679
You two are even worse
than the German!

43:18.846 --> 43:20.348
Don't touch it!

43:42.787 --> 43:45.039
Okay, alarm off.

43:46.457 --> 43:49.293
Oh, what have we here?

43:49.877 --> 43:52.171
He can take that one again.

43:58.136 --> 44:00.263
We'll leave him that one.

44:04.559 --> 44:06.310
Doesn't he have any friends?

44:06.853 --> 44:08.938
Germans don't have friends.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.732
Not even German friends?

44:14.277 --> 44:16.571
Time for new contacts.

44:18.781 --> 44:21.033
That's not very many.

44:21.284 --> 44:22.535
Yes.

44:23.202 --> 44:24.912
So it seems.

44:37.466 --> 44:39.385
Herr Kommissar!

44:42.680 --> 44:45.141
We wanted to have a look at something!

45:19.550 --> 45:21.219
Hey, you pretty things.

45:21.469 --> 45:23.054
Move aside.

45:24.931 --> 45:27.558
Look over there.
There's your hospital.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.565
Come on.

45:47.954 --> 45:49.455
Get off.

45:50.873 --> 45:53.167
- I don't believe it.
- What don't you believe?

45:53.918 --> 45:55.753
Well, I was certain that...

45:55.920 --> 45:58.381
Of course we have a hospital.
What did you think?

46:25.700 --> 46:27.368
Stop it, you fool!

47:11.746 --> 47:14.498
You see,
everything's as it should be.

47:14.665 --> 47:18.544
Now you can call your boss to tell him
the loan wasn't for a phantom.

47:24.008 --> 47:25.468
I...

47:26.552 --> 47:28.262
I think I owe you an apology.

47:31.515 --> 47:33.059
You know, my friend...

47:33.601 --> 47:34.810
I like you.

47:36.645 --> 47:37.688
Thanks.

47:49.116 --> 47:50.493
Yannis, calm down!

47:50.743 --> 47:52.828
It's me, Panos! Calm down!

47:53.537 --> 47:56.207
Everything's okay, it's all good!

47:59.377 --> 48:01.128
Why did you scare me like that?

48:01.295 --> 48:04.090
We told you
we were going to look at the hospital.

48:07.218 --> 48:10.596
- With Pep Guardiola?
- That's the German from the bank.

48:11.222 --> 48:13.557
He has to take some photos.

48:13.974 --> 48:15.935
Come, come on.

48:18.771 --> 48:21.232
- What's your name, Herr Kommissar?
- Geissner.

48:21.399 --> 48:23.025
Well, Jdrg.

48:32.785 --> 48:35.121
Ah, Giorgios! That's a name!

48:53.055 --> 48:54.515
Ah, surgeon.

48:57.977 --> 49:00.980
By the way,
Dr Yannis makes his own wine.

49:41.687 --> 49:43.314
Hello, Dr Laichinger.

49:43.481 --> 49:45.441
<i>Geissner, why haven't you called?</i>

49:46.108 --> 49:48.277
We're inspecting the hospital.

49:48.444 --> 49:49.487
<i>The what?</i>

49:49.653 --> 49:51.864
I was surprised too,
but everything's in order.

49:52.698 --> 49:55.534
And we're about
to visit the power plant.

49:55.701 --> 49:58.496
<i>But I want the beach.
We need the beach!</i>

49:58.662 --> 50:00.581
<i>Or else our nice bank is done for.</i>

50:00.748 --> 50:02.374
I know that, Dr Laichinger.

50:02.625 --> 50:06.045
<i>You'd better not let them
pull the wool over your eyes, Geissner.</i>

50:06.212 --> 50:07.421
Yes, I'm on it.

50:16.263 --> 50:18.307
I think we should move on.

50:18.974 --> 50:21.060
Just one more glass.

50:23.854 --> 50:25.606
But only one.

50:29.735 --> 50:31.779
But I'm not a doctor,

50:32.863 --> 50:35.407
I'm a surgeon.

51:12.528 --> 51:14.572
Giorgios, give me your phone!

51:16.824 --> 51:18.826
Give it to me, I know how it works.

51:31.255 --> 51:33.507
- Feta?
- Yes, look.

51:33.757 --> 51:35.759
- I look great.
- Nice.

51:36.302 --> 51:38.929
- I have my eyes closed.
- But I said "feta"!

51:39.096 --> 51:40.889
You should've waited.

51:41.056 --> 51:43.100
It turned out nicely.

52:30.814 --> 52:32.149
Left!

52:32.775 --> 52:33.776
My God!

52:37.571 --> 52:39.531
Everything okay?

52:41.575 --> 52:43.577
My God, I said "left"!

52:46.705 --> 52:48.499
What the hell do you expect?

52:48.666 --> 52:51.919
It's dark!
How should I tell left from right?

52:52.961 --> 52:56.632
My God,
I almost dropped the bottle.

52:59.468 --> 53:01.595
Bravo, Giorgios, bravo!

53:04.807 --> 53:07.518
Are you guys CFaZY?

53:28.288 --> 53:30.499
There you have your power plant!

53:31.250 --> 53:33.252
Come on, take a couple of pictures!

53:35.003 --> 53:37.548
You have an electric power plant.

53:37.715 --> 53:40.509
- Yes.
- You have an electric power plant!

53:40.676 --> 53:42.720
We have a bloody electric power plant!

53:50.352 --> 53:53.021
What did I tell you?

53:53.188 --> 53:54.648
Perfect.

53:54.815 --> 53:56.275
Unbelievable.

54:05.033 --> 54:07.369
It's just...

54:13.667 --> 54:16.879
What's wrong with him?
What were you drinking?

54:26.430 --> 54:27.598
It's locked!

54:27.848 --> 54:29.558
I don't have a key!

54:31.560 --> 54:34.146
But I have to go in there.

54:34.313 --> 54:37.024
I have to take some pictures!

54:37.191 --> 54:40.527
Give me the key, pretty please.

54:40.778 --> 54:42.780
I really don't have a key.

54:43.030 --> 54:45.240
He doesn't have a key.

54:46.158 --> 54:49.578
- Maybe he has a key. Do you?
- Me? I don't have any keys.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.497
He doesn't have one either.

54:51.747 --> 54:54.666
- Take a picture of the door!
- Yeah, right.

54:55.042 --> 54:58.003
I'll take a picture of the locked door.

55:01.215 --> 55:03.425
There's nothing in there anyway!

55:03.592 --> 55:05.385
- What?
- Only a couple of turbines!

55:05.636 --> 55:07.513
A couple of turbines!

55:11.433 --> 55:14.436
- Come with me.
- What now?

55:20.734 --> 55:23.737
You can hear the turbines working.

57:43.335 --> 57:47.631
<i>- Doctor...
- Geissner? What the hell's going on there?</i>

57:47.798 --> 57:51.426
- The eclectic... The electric...
- Are you drunk?

57:51.593 --> 57:56.682
The whatchamacallit plant... is there too.

57:56.848 --> 58:01.520
<i>You can't be serious!
I want the beach! The beach! The beach!</i>

58:01.687 --> 58:06.274
<i>Or else our bank is clone for!
We can all look for a new job, Geissner!</i>

58:06.441 --> 58:08.652
But that's not so bad.

58:08.819 --> 58:11.113
<i>- Pardon me?
-Night-night.</i>

58:11.279 --> 58:14.241
<i>Geissner?
Geissner, don't hang up!</i>

58:40.058 --> 58:43.437
Mr Geissner! You forgot your receipt!

58:45.022 --> 58:47.733
- Maria. Thanks.
- Have a good trip.

58:47.983 --> 58:49.401
What are they doing?

58:49.985 --> 58:52.237
- They're kissing.
- What? Give them to me!

59:28.982 --> 59:31.276
- Panos!
- Come on!

59:37.365 --> 59:40.035
Don't make the departure
harder than it already is.

59:56.843 --> 59:59.596
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.376
Goodbye, my friend.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.129
And give Merkel a kiss for me.

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.669
What are those idiots telling him?

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:16.798
Hey...

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:18.967
Something's not right.

01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:20.760
Give them here.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.685
What's wrong with him?

01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:31.271
Has he lost it?

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:47.162
He's going!

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.039
What did I tell you?

01:01:50.165 --> 01:01:51.666
There goes the German.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:53.418
He's going.

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:56.838
Did you mean that
in a positive or a negative way?

01:01:57.756 --> 01:01:59.174
I don't know...

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.176
I kind of liked him.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.971
Did you fall in love, silly?

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:07.474
- Tell me.
- No, I didn't fall in love.

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:16.399
It can't be!

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:18.818
What is it? Give them to me.

01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:21.821
What's he doing there?

01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:29.663
Mr Geissner?

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:20.672
<i>Dr Laichinger. Mailbox.
Leave a message.</i>

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:24.926
Yes. Hello, Dr Laichinger.

01:03:25.093 --> 01:03:28.263
Unfortunately, my departure
has been slightly delayed.

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:33.059
There is a problem
with the power plant after all.

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:36.146
I cannot verify its authenticity 100%.

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:40.775
Yup.

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:50.327
May I come in?

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:02.130
Try one.

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.299
Try one.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.681
Thank you.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:17.812
I told you to stay away from him.

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:23.151
It's so easy to give your heart to Panos.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:25.070
But...

01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:28.239
with the hearts of others, he just...

01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:38.291
Hey, Rolando.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:40.251
<i>Rename.</i>

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:42.504
That's right, Ronaldo.

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:49.552
I think I have to speak with your dad.

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:52.806
Please don't hurt him.

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:55.600
We'll see.

01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:00.313
We'll see.

01:05:09.197 --> 01:05:10.573
Oh God.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.247
Giorgios?
Giorgios, my friend!

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:19.916
What a surprise!
You stayed after all.

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:28.842
I found out that your island
is supplied via undersea cable.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.513
Your electric power plant is not real.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.557
Not real?
What are you talking about?

01:05:35.807 --> 01:05:39.060
- We went there together!
- I want to see it from the inside.

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:40.603
Of course. Sure.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.815
But shouldn't a friendship
be based on trust?

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:46.943
Trust. Trust you?

01:05:47.527 --> 01:05:50.071
The guy who thinks he's Odysseus?

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:52.699
Freedom, freedom, I need freedom!

01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:56.870
You don't even care about your son
because of your bloody freedom!

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:01.166
I don't trust guys like that.

01:06:01.749 --> 01:06:04.294
Okay. That hurt.

01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:08.381
You'll get your power plant.
Inside and out, upside and down!

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:12.260
Who do you Germans think you are?
You still think you're special.

01:06:12.427 --> 01:06:14.262
Show me the power plant!

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:16.639
Fine. My cousin
can bring the key in five days.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:19.893
No, no!
No more cousins, and no five days.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:22.395
I want to see the power plant tomorrow.

01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:25.356
In two days I lose my job.

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:30.361
- That's not my problem.
- Oh yes! That's your biggest problem!

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:34.991
Because tomorrow evening I'll report
that your power plant doesn't exist,

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:38.411
and we'll build a giant hotel here
like you've never seen before!

01:06:38.578 --> 01:06:41.789
We'll turn your Galapagos
into the new Majorca!

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:46.211
I want to see the power plant. Tomorrow!

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:50.548
But I don't have a key!

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.987
This time I'm going to get you.

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:40.098
Come with me.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.353
Hey, little man,
keep an eye on the shop.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.874
Get in, I'll show you something.

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:10.169
You want to take the boat
to the power plant?

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:11.421
Please.

01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:34.694
Why are we transporting a box of dynamite?

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.613
It's for our artificial reef.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.162
You're doing that on purpose, right?

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:53.004
CAUTION HIGH VOLTAGE

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:04.223
- There he is!
- I can see that.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.350
- Do the donkey!
- No!

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:09.270
First comes the short circuit,
then the donkey.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.027
Give it to me.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:21.115
Sometimes you have to take fate
into your own hands.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:22.908
Watch out.

01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:38.383
- Come on, get up.
- What's going on?

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:40.885
Get up, I said.
Come on, get up!

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:47.600
We're going to drop anchor here,
and I'll prove the cable is out of order.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:52.229
You'd rather kill us than admit
you've been deceiving me the whole time?

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:02.156
The donkey!
Do the donkey!

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.831
- Did you hear a donkey?
- I have no idea.

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:11.958
Yes, it was a donkey!

01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:16.421
- You can throw the anchor!
- No.

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:21.384
- Yes!
- Not with a 30,000 volt cable down there!

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.219
Damn it!

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:25.805
Why isn't it stopping?

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.433
But we've already done the donkey!

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:31.561
- We have to warn Panos!
- But the German will hear us!

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:33.271
I'll pull out the cable!

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:35.606
Give me your jacket!
And you give me your sweater!

01:10:35.773 --> 01:10:37.817
- Are you crazy?
- Do it!

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:40.403
Go on! Quick!

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:46.242
Give that to me.

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.505
That was someone yelling.

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:01.883
That was a donkey!
Here! Throw it in.

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:04.010
- Take it off me!
- No, you!

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:06.679
Watch out!

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:09.056
- Why?
- High voltage!

01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:18.441
Give it here!

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:33.456
Oh, God!

01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:39.796
Nothing happened.

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:42.089
- What?
- Nothing happened!

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:12.245
- Spyros, are you okay?
- Are you still alive?

01:12:12.411 --> 01:12:14.330
- Are you still alive?
- Are you in pain?

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:24.799
What did I tell you?
No electricity.

01:12:26.425 --> 01:12:27.552
Move!

01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:35.184
Happy new year.

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:53.703
Your hand!

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:55.663
Your hand!

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:02.169
Giorgios!

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:04.797
Your hand!

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:16.100
One, two, three!

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.153
Oh, no!

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:14.283
Bloody hell!

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:17.119
- Daddy, it's not my fault.
- Bloody hell!

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.585
Out of the way!

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:38.808
Listen, little man...

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:40.977
It's not your fault.

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:42.937
It was a power outage!

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:50.361
I'm an idiot.

01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:56.993
Listen, little man, listen.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:15:01.247
Do you want to work for me?
Full-time. For life. Huh?

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:05.584
Do you want to work for me? Forever?

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:08.170
Come here.

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:29.734
I have to go again for a while.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.361
I'll be back.
I have to take care of something.

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:53.507
It'll be fine.

01:15:53.674 --> 01:15:55.217
Dr Yannis can do it.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.261
His mother was a seamstress.

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:01.265
I'm so sorry.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:03.726
I'm sorry, mate.

01:16:05.436 --> 01:16:06.937
I'm sorry too.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.568
It was nice all the same.

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:15.112
Yes, it was.

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:20.826
Giorgios! Giorgios!

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:23.829
Damn it, don't do this to me!

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:26.874
Herr Kommissar, grit your teeth.

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:30.377
- Don't die.
- Herr Kommissar! Herr Kommissar!

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:33.923
Giorgios, my friend,
I'm so sorry, I didn't want this!

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:13.671
<i>You have to see the inside
of the power plant.</i>

01:17:13.838 --> 01:17:17.049
<i>And don't let them
fool you!</i>

01:17:28.018 --> 01:17:30.646
<i>You poor man, Geissner.</i>

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:39.738
What did they do with you?

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.533
It's not all that bad.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:46.245
You're a brave man.

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:49.498
And your effort was not in vain.

01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:52.209
We've got them!

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:57.006
They staged quite a fairy tale for you.

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:00.634
The power plant isn't real.

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:07.766
The beach is ours, Jérg.
We're saved.

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:11.896
And you, dear Geissner, will soon be home.

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:14.231
With your AVO Bank family.

01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:15.482
GET WELL

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:18.319
With best wishes
from your colleagues.

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.157
Schewe?

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:30.873
Yes.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:34.960
Are you serious?
A bit faster, Schewe.

01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:42.051
And stay on it!

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:47.306
To type the amount, press here.
2.50 euro, for example. Okay?

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:49.767
Tick, tock, bang. See? Easy.

01:18:50.017 --> 01:18:52.478
If you want to open the till,
what do you do?

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:53.812
Then you press here.

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:55.231
Press it.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:58.192
No, wrong button.

01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:01.237
No matter. There's just
one important thing to remember:

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:04.240
Beautiful women and Greeks
only pay half.

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:08.160
Germans, Brits and Russians pay double.
The rest pays the normal price.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.040
Pep! Do you want a beer?

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:14.833
Four euros.

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:17.544
- Giorgios is a Greek now.
- One euro.

01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:19.964
Bravo!

01:19:20.381 --> 01:19:21.924
Hey-

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:29.181
I'm sorry about the finger.

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:33.102
Oh. I'm the one who's sorry.

01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:36.939
- Because of the beach.
- Let them come.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.650
That sort of thing can take a while.

01:19:43.988 --> 01:19:45.489
Giorgios...

01:19:45.906 --> 01:19:48.784
Do you mind
if I don't come to the harbour?

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:51.578
I don't like goodbyes.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:57.209
No, that's fine by me.
I don't like goodbyes either.

01:20:00.004 --> 01:20:01.922
Sorry.

01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:07.886
<i>- Dr Laichinger.
- Geissner. Where are you?</i>

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:11.473
<i>- I'll be</i> right <i>there.
- Hurry up. Hop to it.</i>

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:26.030
Good bye.

01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:29.575
I'll take you.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:33.996
Thanks.

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.850
Well...

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:57.311
Thank you.

01:20:57.478 --> 01:20:59.730
Thank you for everything.

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:03.442
It was so unbelievably nice here with you.

01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:15.412
I thank you too.

01:21:17.331 --> 01:21:19.291
Have a good trip.

01:21:22.836 --> 01:21:24.838
Can't you just shut up for once!

01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:26.882
It's just unbearable!

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:53.492
Herr Kommissar...

01:22:17.349 --> 01:22:19.268
What a fantastic Pep Guardiola!

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:21.770
Yes, indeed.

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:42.916
Odysseus!

01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:48.630
Odysseus!

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:51.300
- What's all this nonsense, Geissner?
- Odysseus!

01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:06.857
Odysseus.

01:23:07.107 --> 01:23:10.861
Damn it, Geissner,
what the hell are you doing?

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:14.573
Odysseus!

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:44.770
- I'm staying here!
- Yeah!

01:24:21.682 --> 01:24:25.352
Well. Like I said:

01:24:25.519 --> 01:24:28.939
At least it's a good story.

01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:32.734
<i>I ask you</i>

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:37.901
<i>What could possibly befall me</i>

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:39.950
<i>What could possibly befall me</i>

01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:46.873
<i>Believe me, I love life</i>

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:53.297
<i>The carousel will go on turning</i>

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:59.720
<i>Even if we go our separate ways</i>

01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:05.851
<i>Even if we go our separate ways</i>

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:12.691
<i>You know I love life</i>
