<i>Previously on</i> Hawaii Five-O...

00:04.990 --> 00:06.555
Who are you?
I'm Marco Reyes.

00:06.557 --> 00:09.324
When your brother disappeared,
he was in possession

00:09.326 --> 00:11.216
<i>of a significant amount</i>
<i>of my money.</i>

00:11.218 --> 00:13.652
$18½ million.

00:13.654 --> 00:16.018
You have until Monday to bring
my money to this address.

00:16.020 --> 00:17.619
What happens if I don't
bring you the money?

00:17.621 --> 00:19.217
You'll get a package with
your brother's head in it.

00:19.219 --> 00:23.188
<i> Reyes said that Matty</i>
<i>owed him $18½ million.</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:26.787
You see, this is only
$13 million.

00:26.789 --> 00:27.723
Are you sure?

00:27.725 --> 00:28.725
Yes, I am positive.

00:28.726 --> 00:29.827
I counted it three times.

00:29.829 --> 00:33.218
And now I am, uh,
$5½ million short,

00:33.220 --> 00:35.948
and I have two days to come up
with all of it,

00:35.950 --> 00:38.179
or, um, my brother's dead.

00:38.181 --> 00:40.141
I really don't see any other ways.
I may have one.

00:40.142 --> 00:41.969
Maybe we can do
a little quid pro quo.

00:41.971 --> 00:43.638
Tell me what you want.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.038
Immediate transfer
to the special holding unit

00:46.040 --> 00:47.342
at the high-security facility.

00:47.344 --> 00:49.674
There I'll get a private cell,
and for that

00:49.676 --> 00:50.769
I am willing to pay...

00:50.771 --> 00:52.504
$5½ million.

00:52.506 --> 00:54.006
This is gonna cost you

00:54.008 --> 00:56.740

possibly predict.

The vivisection of a

03:18.363 --> 03:21.263

invested a lot in him,

care who Danny is;

08:03.995 --> 08:06.233

called “Sandpiper.”

09:12.365 --> 09:13.691

all this?

09:13.693 --> 09:14.730

09:14.732 --> 09:15.763
Here's how it worked.

09:15.765 --> 09:16.827
Wall Street invested

09:16.829 --> 09:19.036
in the expanding housing
market in Colombia.

09:19.038 --> 09:20.868
What they didn't realize was
they were actually buying

09:20.870 --> 09:22.572
into a cocaine
cartel's

09:22.574 --> 09:24.204
laundering scheme.

09:24.206 --> 09:26.509
When the Colombian government
made a stronger push

09:26.511 --> 09:28.509
toward drug enforcement,
U.S. banks, all of a sudden,

09:28.511 --> 09:30.308
started taking
huge hits.

09:30.310 --> 09:32.683
Indirectly affecting
the stability of our economy.

09:32.685 --> 09:35.051

no choice but to step in,

09:35.053 --> 09:36.986
keep the drugs flowing

09:36.988 --> 09:39.250
to prevent a potential
market crash.

09:39.252 --> 09:40.955
And Marco Reyes was
moving the coke.

09:40.957 --> 09:41.923
That's right.

09:41.925 --> 09:43.892
He's been on their
books for years.

09:43.894 --> 09:45.564
CIA had him under
surveillance,

09:45.566 --> 09:47.597

Danny pulled the trigger.

09:47.599 --> 09:49.301
And that you were
there to witness it.

09:49.303 --> 09:50.637
All right,
so they also knew

09:50.639 --> 09:52.806
that Reyes killed
Danny's brother.

09:59.114 --> 10:01.017
As far as the CIA's concerned,

10:01.019 --> 10:03.081
his murder was the
cost of doing business.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.353
All right, fine, but,
Joe, you just said it--

10:04.355 --> 10:06.785

Coughlin has something,
or is this just

10:34.774 --> 10:36.069
another one of his shakedowns?

10:36.071 --> 10:37.206
He said Coughlin
wouldn't have booked Chin

10:37.208 --> 10:38.928
unless he had something
that was rock solid.

10:45.523 --> 10:47.984
So, tax evasion, huh?

10:47.986 --> 10:50.224
At least, that's a new one.

10:50.226 --> 10:51.921
Don't knock it.

10:51.923 --> 10:54.393
That's what took down Capone.

10:56.028 --> 10:59.466
Only you're no Capone,
Mr. Kelly.

10:59.468 --> 11:01.402
That's Lieutenant Kelly to you.
Mm.

11:01.404 --> 11:02.938
Not after today.

11:02.940 --> 11:04.803
You are done being a cop.

11:04.805 --> 11:07.138
From here, you're going
to a cell, the courtroom,

11:07.140 --> 11:10.474
then a concrete box
for 20 years.

11:10.476 --> 11:13.676
Whatever you think you have
on me, it's not gonna stick.

11:13.677 --> 11:15.003
I'll be out of here
on bail soon enough.

11:15.027 --> 11:15.952
“Bail”?

11:15.953 --> 11:18.184
There's not gonna be any bail.

11:18.186 --> 11:19.553
You're a flight risk.

11:19.555 --> 11:21.555
Given that the $5½ million
your brother-in-law gave you

11:21.557 --> 11:24.124
is still unaccounted for.

11:24.126 --> 11:26.933
What? You didn't think we were
gonna find out about that?

11:26.935 --> 11:28.796
Your name's all over the Halawa

11:28.798 --> 11:31.971
visitor's log, and don't tell
me Waincroft's helping you out

11:31.973 --> 11:34.573
with an investigation because
I looked into that as well.

11:34.575 --> 11:37.047
Mr. Kelly, you went
to him for money.

11:37.049 --> 11:39.447
And in exchange,
he was offered

11:39.449 --> 11:41.648
a private cell in the
country club wing.

11:41.650 --> 11:45.090
Well, then you should know
that that's only half the story.

11:45.092 --> 11:47.951
A man named Marco Reyes took
Danny Williams' brother.

11:47.953 --> 11:50.992
I borrowed that money to help
pay for that man's ransom.

11:50.994 --> 11:53.593
And you didn't shave
a little off the top?

11:53.595 --> 11:56.160
Every penny went to the ransom.

11:56.162 --> 11:57.695
Mr. Kelly...

11:57.697 --> 11:59.733
there's a lot
of conflicting evidence

11:59.735 --> 12:01.701
regarding Mr. Reyes.

12:01.703 --> 12:04.132
You're here being charged

12:04.134 --> 12:05.569
with helping
facilitate his murder.

12:05.571 --> 12:09.337
So you can understand
why I'm a little skeptical.

12:09.339 --> 12:10.569
It's not about what you think.

12:10.571 --> 12:12.607
It's the truth.

12:13.674 --> 12:15.104
But then again,
you were never really

12:15.106 --> 12:17.209
interested in the truth,
were you?

12:17.211 --> 12:19.512
All you want is
to see me behind bars.

12:19.514 --> 12:22.151
That's where you
belong, Mr. Kelly.

12:22.153 --> 12:24.350
You took drug money
from a cop killer.

12:24.352 --> 12:25.582
No matter how it was used,

12:25.584 --> 12:27.151
that's still a crime.

12:27.153 --> 12:29.220
A friend thought his brother
was going to be murdered.

12:29.222 --> 12:30.620
I did what I could

12:30.622 --> 12:33.491
to help save that man's life.

12:33.493 --> 12:35.588
Detective Williams must
be some kind of friend

12:35.590 --> 12:38.691
if you're willing to throw away
your career and freedom for him.

12:38.693 --> 12:41.697
I mean, I don't know anyone
who would do that for me.

12:43.631 --> 12:47.332
What? Is something funny?

12:47.334 --> 12:50.759
Just the thought
of you having friends.

12:53.729 --> 12:56.631
Your friend killed a man,
and you aided and abetted.

12:56.633 --> 12:59.799
So I'm thinking the only one
who should be smiling here

12:59.801 --> 13:02.473
is me.

13:11.481 --> 13:12.919
<i>I just came from Halawa.</i>

13:12.921 --> 13:14.889
Gabriel Waincroft
isn't there.

13:14.891 --> 13:16.824
Where is he?
I don't know.

13:16.826 --> 13:18.520
But I think Coughlin took him
and stashed him somewhere

13:18.522 --> 13:20.689
as a preemptive strike.
Coughlin's no dummy.

13:20.691 --> 13:22.627
He probably figured
we'd go to Halawa

13:22.629 --> 13:25.404
to see what Waincroft told IA.

13:25.406 --> 13:27.005
Okay, we're gonna have to assume

13:27.007 --> 13:28.342
that Gabriel
didn't tell Coughlin

13:28.344 --> 13:30.777
what Chin was using
the money for.

13:30.779 --> 13:32.714
Well, this bum's been in
the system most of his life.

13:32.716 --> 13:34.115
He knows the game.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.819
He's holding onto
the information.

13:35.821 --> 13:37.955
Withholding the truth to
maybe make a another deal

13:37.957 --> 13:39.924
in case Coughlin doesn't bite.

13:39.926 --> 13:41.860
Okay, Gabriel knows
that my cousin's an easy target.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.660
If he told IA that Chin took
the money for himself,

13:44.662 --> 13:48.427
Coughlin's going to make sure
he loses his badge and for good.

13:48.429 --> 13:51.832
$18½ million.

13:53.432 --> 13:55.470
I have to imagine that
was pretty heavy.

13:55.472 --> 13:58.206
We got you with the bags coming
and going, Detective, so

13:58.208 --> 14:00.500
where's the money?

14:00.502 --> 14:03.509
The money, uh, would be
right where we left it.

14:03.511 --> 14:06.508
Uh, St. Joseph's
Casa de Los Niños.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.707
An orphanage?

14:13.719 --> 14:15.821
You must really love kids

14:15.823 --> 14:18.486
to leave them that
kind of cash, huh?

14:20.625 --> 14:23.496
I mean...

14:23.498 --> 14:27.032
you offed a guy and...

14:27.034 --> 14:28.903
you and your accomplice,
you could've just, uh,

14:28.905 --> 14:32.237
you could've just
retired on that.

14:33.469 --> 14:36.737
You're from Boston?

14:36.739 --> 14:38.875
Patriots.

14:38.877 --> 14:41.309
Bruins and Red Sox.

14:41.311 --> 14:43.479
But that's hardly relevant.

14:43.481 --> 14:45.319
Right, no, I'm just,
I'm just trying to figure out

14:45.321 --> 14:48.422
why a guy who grew up
300 miles away from me

14:48.424 --> 14:52.295
cares so much about
a scumbag drug-dealing murderer,

14:52.297 --> 14:54.193
uh, from South America.

14:54.195 --> 14:56.466
I care about the law.

14:56.468 --> 14:58.331
And you broke it.

15:00.142 --> 15:01.940
It's really that simple.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.772
Marco Reyes cut
my brother up into pieces

15:03.774 --> 15:06.276
and put him in an oil drum.

15:06.278 --> 15:09.245
Hmm. And you murdered
him in cold blood.

15:09.247 --> 15:12.948
You know, you know,
Mr. Reyes had a family.

15:12.950 --> 15:14.852
Two young boys.

15:14.854 --> 15:17.724
Just about the same
age as your daughter.

15:17.726 --> 15:19.259
Did you know that?

15:23.325 --> 15:25.859
You took the law in your
own hands, Detective.

15:25.861 --> 15:28.804
Out of all people, you
should've known better.

15:28.806 --> 15:31.037
Well, I guess I'm gonna have
to live with that, right?

15:31.039 --> 15:34.006
But what I, what I don't
understand is why you are here.

15:34.008 --> 15:36.075
Why you are working this case.

15:36.077 --> 15:38.179
Like I said-- you broke the law.

15:38.181 --> 15:40.146
It's really that simple.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.512
No, no, no. I'm a cop.

15:41.514 --> 15:43.343
I've been reading liars
half my life.

15:43.345 --> 15:44.680
It can't be that simple.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.249
Okay, well, you're
gonna have a lot of time

15:46.251 --> 15:47.912
on the plane to
think it through.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.677
Oh, well, I already, um,

15:49.679 --> 15:51.245
I already thought it through
a little bit.

15:51.247 --> 15:52.784
Tell me what you think. Uh...

15:52.786 --> 15:55.025
Reyes was on your payroll.

15:55.027 --> 15:57.564
Or the Colombians...
or both, whatever.

15:57.566 --> 16:01.068
And, um, whatever he was into
is still in play

16:01.070 --> 16:02.804
because now somebody
wants payback.

16:02.806 --> 16:04.300
Not payback for his murder.

16:04.302 --> 16:07.108
I'm sure his mother didn't
even care about that.

16:07.110 --> 16:10.570
But, no, you need someone
to take the fall, uh,

16:10.572 --> 16:13.546
because Reyes expired before you
got what you wanted out of him.

16:13.548 --> 16:14.674
Am I...

16:14.676 --> 16:17.312
close? Ballpark?

16:19.417 --> 16:22.811
I'm gonna get you
a book for the plane.

16:24.485 --> 16:26.451
I sign that, what does
my daughter find out?

16:26.453 --> 16:27.955
What does she hear?

16:27.957 --> 16:30.051
What she reads in the papers.

16:30.053 --> 16:32.291
That's all.

16:32.293 --> 16:33.754
And if she comes to visit you,

16:33.756 --> 16:36.591
that's on the Colombians.

16:36.593 --> 16:39.391
There is really no reason

16:39.393 --> 16:41.526
to make this any more
complicated.

16:41.528 --> 16:43.263
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

16:43.265 --> 16:44.599
Is that a threat?
Are you threatening me?

16:44.601 --> 16:46.968
You threatening my family?
I don't understand.

16:46.970 --> 16:50.339
Don't be so shortsighted,
Detective.

16:50.341 --> 16:53.182
Sign the waiver...

16:53.184 --> 16:54.880
and then we're done.

17:12.367 --> 17:15.903
Ellie, what are
you doing here?

17:15.905 --> 17:18.010
If anybody asks,
this fell out of a truck.

17:18.012 --> 17:20.840
Steve, you should know
the hearing's being held today.

17:20.843 --> 17:22.880
An associate close
to the judge just told me

17:22.882 --> 17:25.712
Danny's gonna waive extradition.

17:25.714 --> 17:27.680
Wait a minute--
he-he's voluntarily

17:27.682 --> 17:29.121
surrendering to the Colombians?

17:29.123 --> 17:31.056
Why would he do that?
I don't know.

17:31.058 --> 17:33.920
But as soon as the judge signs
that order, Danny's gone.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.787
Judge is ready.

18:07.037 --> 18:09.307
Hey! Hey, Danny! Danny!

18:09.309 --> 18:12.212
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Commander McGarrett?

18:12.214 --> 18:14.013
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step back from the prisoner.

18:14.015 --> 18:15.613
Who are you? Huh?
Steve, it's okay.

18:15.615 --> 18:18.319
No, it's not okay. This man
has been denied counsel.

18:18.321 --> 18:20.456
That's a violation of his civil
rights, you understand that?

18:20.458 --> 18:23.025
Uh, this man
refused counsel, Commander.

18:23.027 --> 18:25.764
Why would you do that, Danny?

18:25.766 --> 18:28.363
What did you threaten him with?
He-he didn't threaten me.

18:28.365 --> 18:30.466
Steve, listen to me.
I signed the paper.

18:30.468 --> 18:31.896
Everything's okay.
Just please talk to Grace

18:31.898 --> 18:33.665
and tell her I'm okay
and that I'm gonna

18:33.667 --> 18:35.838
call her soon as I can.
Can you do that, please?

18:35.840 --> 18:36.838
I'm not going anywhere.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.301
You listen to me, listen to me.

18:38.303 --> 18:39.437
I was there.

18:39.439 --> 18:41.374
When Marco Reyes was murdered,

18:41.376 --> 18:42.543
I was in the room--
you understand?

18:42.545 --> 18:44.912
You hearing me?
If the Colombians want Danny,

18:44.914 --> 18:46.281
they want me, too.

18:46.283 --> 18:47.819
Yeah, well, then you're lucky
that your friend here is

18:47.821 --> 18:49.691
keeping you off their radar.
No, no, no, no.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.090
I'm not gonna let you do that.
You're not gonna sign

18:51.092 --> 18:52.953
an extradition to protect me.
What are you doing?

18:52.955 --> 18:54.153
You don't have a choice.

18:54.155 --> 18:55.920
Deal's been made.
Call Grace, huh?

18:55.922 --> 18:57.287
Call Gra...

18:57.289 --> 18:59.262
Call Grace, huh?

18:59.264 --> 19:02.093
Promise me you'll
talk to Grace.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.619
How's my brother-in-law?

19:17.621 --> 19:19.315
How do you think?

19:19.317 --> 19:22.690
Well, I didn't tell him
to come to me for money.

19:22.692 --> 19:24.952
He did that all on his own.

19:24.954 --> 19:28.791
Yeah, about that money
you gave him.

19:28.793 --> 19:32.094
He told me every penny
went to buy back

19:32.096 --> 19:33.230
Detective Williams' brother.

19:33.232 --> 19:36.630
Well, that sounds
like a noble cause.

19:36.632 --> 19:39.599
But I gave Chin that money
to move me out of general pop.

19:39.601 --> 19:43.169
And for that,
he got $5½ million.

19:43.171 --> 19:47.210
That's a lot of money
for a change of scenery.

19:47.212 --> 19:48.851
True.

19:48.853 --> 19:51.313
But being the brother-in-law
of a cop

19:51.315 --> 19:53.878
didn't make me
very popular in Halawa.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.147
So what it came down to
was that money

19:56.149 --> 19:58.313
or my life.

19:59.715 --> 20:01.712
And you'll testify to that?

20:01.714 --> 20:03.844
And see that hypocrite
go to jail?

20:03.846 --> 20:06.051
Absolutely.

20:06.053 --> 20:08.586
But you're gonna need
to sweeten the deal.

20:11.957 --> 20:14.290
I'm listening.

20:14.292 --> 20:16.689
I want a sentence reduction.

20:16.691 --> 20:18.488
You're a cop killer.

20:18.490 --> 20:20.158
That's not gonna happen.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.089
Then I guess you won't be
getting Chin Ho Kelly.

20:23.091 --> 20:26.624
I can try to get you
a commuted sentence.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.225
Submit a petition
to the governor.

20:29.633 --> 20:32.630
I have a better chance
of winning the lottery.

20:33.936 --> 20:37.505
How does minimum security sound?

20:37.507 --> 20:39.242
Not good enough.

20:39.244 --> 20:41.674
That's all I got.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.482
I want that in writing.

20:45.484 --> 20:47.683
I'll have it drawn up.

20:50.556 --> 20:52.079
<i>Okay, so Duke's standing by.</i>

20:52.081 --> 20:54.350
As soon as Coughlin surfaces,
we're gonna put a tail on him

20:54.352 --> 20:56.348
and find out where
he's holding Gabriel.

20:56.350 --> 20:58.115
Duke's a good man.
Yeah.

20:58.117 --> 20:59.954
How you holding up?

20:59.956 --> 21:02.353
The truth?

21:04.058 --> 21:06.391
I, um, I can't shake
this feeling

21:06.393 --> 21:08.893
in my gut that my cousin

21:08.895 --> 21:10.220
is gonna go to prison this time.

21:10.222 --> 21:12.426
You know, after
their last go-around,

21:12.428 --> 21:13.393
Coughlin's way too smart

21:13.395 --> 21:14.792
to go after Chin
without knowing for sure

21:14.794 --> 21:16.327
that he has an airtight case.

21:16.329 --> 21:18.358
The Asset Forfeiture Team from the
State Attorney General's Office

21:18.360 --> 21:20.195
already sealed up his house.

21:20.197 --> 21:21.921
His property's being seized...

21:21.923 --> 21:23.561
He's losing everything that

21:23.563 --> 21:25.863
he ever worked and fought for
his entire life.

21:25.865 --> 21:28.126
Chin knew the risks when he
was asking for that money.

21:28.128 --> 21:30.293
He didn't care,
'cause Danny was in trouble

21:30.295 --> 21:31.460
and your cousin was there.

21:31.462 --> 21:33.664
Now we're gonna
be there for him.

21:33.666 --> 21:34.727
And if Chin's gonna go down,

21:34.729 --> 21:35.924
he's not gonna go down
without a fight.

21:35.926 --> 21:37.162
I like the sound of that.

21:37.164 --> 21:38.361
Good.

21:39.259 --> 21:41.192
Come here.

21:44.530 --> 21:46.432
He'll be all right.

21:46.434 --> 21:47.904
Thanks.

21:49.307 --> 21:50.507
Yeah.

21:56.181 --> 21:58.946
Steve... I just heard
from my contact.

21:58.948 --> 22:02.049
It turns out that there was
more to Danny's arrest

22:02.051 --> 22:04.521
than just bringing him to
justice for the Reyes murder.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.184
What else could it
have been about?

22:07.186 --> 22:09.689
It was an apology of sorts.

22:09.691 --> 22:11.625
Reyes was in the middle
of a big deal

22:11.627 --> 22:14.666
when he was killed
on the CIA's watch,

22:14.668 --> 22:16.096
and somebody has
to answer for that.

22:16.098 --> 22:17.430
How big a deal we talking about?

22:17.432 --> 22:20.194
$1.3 billion of cocaine
never made it to market.

22:20.196 --> 22:22.897
Reyes was the only one who
knew where that shipment was.

22:22.899 --> 22:26.166
The CIA's been looking for it
ever since he was killed.

22:26.168 --> 22:28.262
So this whole thing--
none of it, none of it

22:28.264 --> 22:30.366
is about finding justice
for Reyes' murder.

22:30.368 --> 22:33.973
It's about the missing dope.

22:44.844 --> 22:46.911
What the...?

22:50.983 --> 22:52.877
What the hell do you
think you're doing, Commander?

22:52.879 --> 22:54.013
Want to make a deal.

22:54.015 --> 22:55.013
Deal about what?

22:55.015 --> 22:56.950
Danny's freedom for that

22:56.952 --> 22:58.791
shipment of cocaine
you've been looking for.

23:00.089 --> 23:03.259
Yeah.
You'd better watch your driving.

23:03.261 --> 23:04.922
We know where it is.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.131
We know where it is,
all right?

23:08.965 --> 23:10.867
But you, uh, you don't
get to see it

23:10.869 --> 23:11.962
until Danny's been released

23:11.964 --> 23:14.497
with paperwork exonerating him.

23:14.499 --> 23:17.601
Well, that's a nice offer,
but he's gone.

23:19.337 --> 23:21.008
What do you mean he's gone?

23:21.010 --> 23:23.675
I just took Detective Williams
to the plane two hours ago.

23:23.677 --> 23:24.644
He's on his way to Bogotá.

23:25.814 --> 23:28.284
But you find that cocaine,

23:28.286 --> 23:30.788
and I can guarantee you
that the Colombian government

23:30.790 --> 23:33.756
will, uh... will approve that.

23:37.889 --> 23:39.590
Give me 48 hours.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.324
Done.

23:42.494 --> 23:44.658
Good luck.

23:52.866 --> 23:55.897
We have no idea
where that cocaine is.

23:56.635 --> 23:58.266
No, we don't.

24:13.765 --> 24:16.332
Guy come in with
a warrant, nothing I can do.

24:16.334 --> 24:18.132
Hey, I don't care
what your warrant says,

24:18.134 --> 24:20.202
you got five seconds
to leave this office.

24:20.204 --> 24:21.569
You having
a bad day, Commander?

24:21.571 --> 24:22.633
Five...

24:22.635 --> 24:24.064
You really gonna
protect a crooked cop?

24:24.066 --> 24:25.399
Four...

24:25.401 --> 24:26.566
You understand you are
interfering with

24:26.568 --> 24:27.637
an official investigation.

24:27.639 --> 24:28.733
Three...
There will be consequences.

24:28.735 --> 24:30.036
Two...

24:30.038 --> 24:31.140
Very well.

24:31.142 --> 24:32.572
I already have what I need.

24:33.542 --> 24:35.644
Ah... that stays here.
That stays here.

24:35.646 --> 24:37.379
Mmm, afraid it's
not up to you.

24:38.476 --> 24:41.313
I can read it to you
if you like.

24:42.179 --> 24:44.683
Or not.

24:44.685 --> 24:47.020
Have a good evening, gentlemen.

24:50.527 --> 24:52.590
Stay focused.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.035
Guys, come on.

25:01.037 --> 25:04.001
We've been over
all this stuff three times.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.533
There's nothing
in any of this stuff

25:05.535 --> 25:08.330
that's gonna tell us where Reyes
hid three tons of cocaine.

25:08.332 --> 25:10.698
If the National Police
can't find it in their raids,

25:10.700 --> 25:12.297
there's no way
we're gonna do this

25:12.299 --> 25:14.136
from 6,000 miles away without

25:14.138 --> 25:15.471
kicking in some doors.

25:15.473 --> 25:18.039
I mean, we can't just go
down there without good Intel.

25:18.041 --> 25:20.008
In 39 hours, the clock stops.

25:21.147 --> 25:23.683
Okay, so the tail on Coughlin
just came through.

25:23.685 --> 25:26.251
Gabriel's being held in a
safe house just outside Hau'ula.

25:26.253 --> 25:27.882
IA's got it
on lockdown.

25:27.884 --> 25:29.818
We're not gonna be able
to get to him

25:29.820 --> 25:31.050
without it getting ugly.
Doesn't matter.

25:31.052 --> 25:32.625
He's not gonna
be there long anyway.

25:32.627 --> 25:33.921
As soon as Coughlin

25:33.923 --> 25:36.256
locks up his case against Chin,

25:36.258 --> 25:38.928
Gabriel's going
right back inside.

25:43.531 --> 25:45.032
All right.

25:45.034 --> 25:47.635
No one person is more important
than the other,

25:47.637 --> 25:49.171
but Chin is here

25:49.173 --> 25:51.641
and Danny is a cop
in a South American prison.

25:51.643 --> 25:54.243
If we don't move fast,
he's not gonna last the week.

25:57.583 --> 25:59.116
Oh.

25:59.118 --> 26:01.083
I'll be back.

26:02.654 --> 26:04.924
There's something I need
to take care of, too, all right?

26:04.926 --> 26:06.461
Where are you go...?

26:06.463 --> 26:08.367
Where is everybody going?

26:08.369 --> 26:10.064
Where you going?

26:18.356 --> 26:20.820
Danno!

26:23.926 --> 26:25.926
<i> They said he was</i>
<i>arrested for murder.</i>

26:29.967 --> 26:32.764
It's a complicated situation.

26:32.766 --> 26:35.833
Is it true?
Did he kill someone?

26:38.642 --> 26:40.103
Who is it?

26:40.105 --> 26:42.407
Was he bad?

26:42.409 --> 26:45.408
Gracie, listen to me, all right?

26:45.410 --> 26:49.679
You have to believe
in your father.

26:49.681 --> 26:51.613
Your dad, he's the
best man I know,

26:51.615 --> 26:52.844
and everything
he does,

26:52.846 --> 26:54.916
he does to protect
the people he loves.

26:54.918 --> 26:59.047
So, no matter what happens,
you got to know that.

26:59.049 --> 27:00.886
Okay.

27:01.816 --> 27:03.619
Come here.

27:06.221 --> 27:07.522
I promise you, kid,

27:07.524 --> 27:09.419
I promise I'm gonna bring
Danno home, all right?

27:09.421 --> 27:11.624
Okay.

27:14.255 --> 27:16.020
I love you.

27:56.682 --> 27:59.185
Here's what I got
from my contact.

27:59.187 --> 28:02.490
This is an oil refinery owned
by an old Marco Reyes front man.

28:02.492 --> 28:05.228
Someone that he grew up with
and trusted completely.

28:05.230 --> 28:07.797
So, why do we think
the coke's there?

28:08.598 --> 28:10.362
Steve, you said
that Reyes delivered

28:10.364 --> 28:12.496
Danny's brother's body
in an oil drum?

28:12.498 --> 28:14.569
That's right.
According to my contact,

28:14.571 --> 28:19.278
the CIA did not know about Matty
until after he was murdered.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.520
That got me thinking--
Reyes had to have held him

28:21.522 --> 28:22.785
in a place that his partners

28:22.787 --> 28:24.457
and the government
did not even know about.

28:24.459 --> 28:26.258
Okay, so
there's security.

28:26.260 --> 28:28.090
Armed guards, 40 strong.

28:28.092 --> 28:29.628
It's guerilla country.

28:29.630 --> 28:31.765
Maybe they're just
protecting the refinery.

28:31.767 --> 28:34.935
Negative. That refinery's been
offline for five years.

28:34.937 --> 28:36.534
Which begs the question:

28:36.536 --> 28:39.272
Why the security
in a defunct facility?

28:39.274 --> 28:41.280
What is there
that's worth protecting?

28:44.512 --> 28:46.516
How reliable is your contact?

28:46.518 --> 28:48.517
110%.

28:52.022 --> 28:54.283
Okay. We got
one shot at this.

28:54.285 --> 28:56.219
If the intel's good,
we got a chance

28:56.221 --> 28:58.460
of bringing Danny home.

28:58.462 --> 29:00.260
If it's not,

29:00.262 --> 29:03.059
we could all end up
in a South American prison.

Thought you guys
had stood me up.

30:11.392 --> 30:12.854
What is this, Frank?

30:12.856 --> 30:14.661
You said you needed
transportation.

30:14.663 --> 30:16.629
What's with you and salvage?

30:16.631 --> 30:20.397
Kid, this is a perfectly good
example of vintage aviation.

30:20.399 --> 30:21.564
Uh-uh.

30:21.566 --> 30:23.395
It's a washing machine
with propellers.

30:24.531 --> 30:27.567
Big man, you're not exactly
paying top dollar here.

30:27.569 --> 30:29.366
In fact, you're not
paying anything at all.

30:29.368 --> 30:30.732
So if I were you,

30:30.734 --> 30:32.563
I'd grab a double-wide seat

30:32.565 --> 30:33.834
and keep a bag handy.

30:33.836 --> 30:35.066
Hang on a second.

30:35.068 --> 30:37.539
I know this old hippie
didn't just call me fat.

30:38.845 --> 30:41.010
Lou Grover, meet Frank Bama.

30:41.012 --> 30:43.778
Best rotor-head to
get you in country.

30:43.780 --> 30:44.914
Yeah.

30:44.916 --> 30:46.146
Yep.

30:46.148 --> 30:47.883
We're gonna need to work on

30:47.885 --> 30:50.018
a little weight distribution
with you.

30:50.020 --> 30:52.217
He just did it again.

30:53.449 --> 30:55.119
All right, let's get
this bird in the air.

30:55.121 --> 30:57.318
We got weather coming.

31:00.289 --> 31:01.624
Don't worry.

31:01.626 --> 31:03.791
It's gonna get done.

31:09.305 --> 31:11.070
Trust me.

31:35.863 --> 31:37.895
The first one is free.

31:37.897 --> 31:40.433
Let me guess.
Second one's gonna cost me?

31:44.643 --> 31:46.705
The only way you going
to survive in here,

31:46.707 --> 31:49.241
amigo, is if you pay.

31:55.519 --> 31:56.717
Understand?

31:56.719 --> 31:58.486
You give us money,

31:58.488 --> 31:59.991
you get to live.

31:59.993 --> 32:01.393
You don't...

32:03.133 --> 32:04.500
<i>¿Estoy claro?</i>

32:06.942 --> 32:08.404
I-I... I can get you money.

32:08.406 --> 32:10.845
I just need to make
a phone call, all right?

32:15.719 --> 32:16.812
Of course.

32:16.814 --> 32:19.347
Whatever you need, amigo.

32:19.349 --> 32:20.883
All right.

32:42.959 --> 32:44.996
Steve, I got radio contact
with the ground

32:44.998 --> 32:46.596
asking us to identify ourselves.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.131
How far out
are we?

32:49.133 --> 32:50.867
Six klicks.

32:56.835 --> 32:58.072
Ignore it.

32:58.074 --> 33:00.668
That's what I thought you'd say.

33:03.939 --> 33:06.104
Guess they didn't like
our answer.

33:09.072 --> 33:11.172
Contact! Spot your targets!

33:11.174 --> 33:12.372
Conserve your ammo!

33:31.438 --> 33:32.733
Go ahead.

33:32.735 --> 33:35.008
Make your phone call.

33:35.010 --> 33:36.672
Get us our money.

33:52.601 --> 33:54.535
Hello?

33:56.170 --> 33:57.809
Hey, monkey, how are you?

33:57.811 --> 33:58.905
You all right?

33:58.907 --> 34:00.873
I love you very much.

34:00.875 --> 34:02.514
Danno, where are you?

34:02.516 --> 34:03.610
Are you okay?

34:03.612 --> 34:04.882
Of course I'm okay.

34:04.884 --> 34:06.146
I'm always okay, huh?

34:06.148 --> 34:07.282
How are you? I love you.

34:07.284 --> 34:09.449
I love you, too, Daddy.

34:09.452 --> 34:11.522
But when are you coming home?

34:11.524 --> 34:13.322
I'm gonna come home
very soon, monkey.

34:13.324 --> 34:14.956
Right away. You hear me?

34:15.559 --> 34:16.766
You think this is a game?

34:16.768 --> 34:17.766
Huh?

34:17.768 --> 34:18.799
I don't think it's a game.

34:18.801 --> 34:20.032
Huh?
No.

34:25.110 --> 34:27.414
We gave you a chance,
and you blew it.

34:50.377 --> 34:52.577
You like to make
a dramatic entrance, don't you?

34:52.579 --> 34:55.650
Yeah, well, uh,
we found your coke.

34:55.652 --> 34:56.683
Where is it?

34:56.685 --> 34:58.516
Well, it's gone.

35:00.693 --> 35:02.322
What do you mean, “gone”?

35:02.324 --> 35:06.161
I mean, uh, we destroyed it.

35:13.869 --> 35:16.436
You realize you just signed your
friend's death warrant, right?

35:16.438 --> 35:18.509
I don't think so.
You see, at the same location,

35:18.511 --> 35:19.973
we didn't just find the drugs.

35:19.975 --> 35:21.341
We found Reyes' books.

35:25.149 --> 35:26.811
This, right here, is everything

35:26.813 --> 35:29.018
to do with Sandpiper.

35:29.020 --> 35:30.346
Including all

35:30.348 --> 35:32.351
the payoff
accounts.

35:32.353 --> 35:34.414
Hey, see, Marco Reyes was, uh,

35:34.416 --> 35:37.018
he was paying money
to a bunch of different people--

35:37.020 --> 35:39.417
various Colombian generals,

35:39.419 --> 35:41.521
politicians,
government officials...

35:43.387 --> 35:45.223
...and one
American.

35:45.225 --> 35:46.318
You.

35:46.320 --> 35:49.250
You never cared about justice;

35:49.252 --> 35:50.657
you never cared about the law.

35:50.659 --> 35:52.583
All you wanted
was your piece of the action.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.752
You are meddling

35:57.754 --> 35:59.581
in international affairs,
Commander.

35:59.583 --> 36:00.716
Just shut up
and listen.

36:00.718 --> 36:02.187
This is what's
gonna happen.

36:02.189 --> 36:04.353
You're gonna have
Detective Williams

36:04.355 --> 36:06.688
returned to U.S. soil

36:06.690 --> 36:08.688
with all charges
dropped.

36:08.690 --> 36:10.120
And the second

36:10.122 --> 36:11.855
his plane touches down in Oahu,

36:11.857 --> 36:13.759
you're gonna resign,

36:13.761 --> 36:14.927
you're gonna collect

36:14.929 --> 36:16.897
your pension,

36:16.899 --> 36:20.099
and then you're gonna disappear.

36:20.101 --> 36:21.370
And if you don't,

36:21.372 --> 36:23.338
this gets
released.

36:34.881 --> 36:36.447
It's all there,

36:36.449 --> 36:37.552
just as we agreed.

36:37.554 --> 36:41.153
All it needs is
your signature.

37:09.526 --> 37:10.483
Lieutenant...

37:10.485 --> 37:13.551
Sign here and you can go.

37:13.553 --> 37:15.151
I don't understand.

37:15.153 --> 37:16.359
Where's Coughlin?

37:18.592 --> 37:19.892
Cuz...

37:19.894 --> 37:22.427
Kono, what's going on?

37:26.197 --> 37:27.332
Coughlin's dead.

37:27.334 --> 37:29.901
And Gabriel's gone.

37:29.903 --> 37:30.933
What?

37:30.935 --> 37:33.602
He killed Coughlin
and then he escaped.

37:35.341 --> 37:37.507
You know, I'm thinking that
was his plan all along.

37:37.509 --> 37:39.643
To get him to move him,

37:39.645 --> 37:41.442
trust him, and then strike.

37:41.444 --> 37:43.313
But now,

37:43.315 --> 37:45.409
without Coughlin
or Gabriel's testimony,

37:45.411 --> 37:47.651
there's no case
against you.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.861
♪ ♪

38:26.989 --> 38:29.259
♪ ♪

38:35.674 --> 38:37.472
Thank you.

38:37.474 --> 38:40.176
You could say
“mahalo”"

38:40.178 --> 38:42.544
I suppose I could.

38:42.546 --> 38:43.944
Still, huh?

38:43.946 --> 38:46.144
After all these years,
you still hate this place.

38:46.146 --> 38:48.647
Oh, no, buddy, I'm still trying
to figure out a way to like you.

38:48.649 --> 38:50.951
Okay? Forget this place.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.350
Fair enough.

38:52.352 --> 38:54.717
Let me ask you
a question.

38:54.719 --> 38:56.555
Why didn't you
lawyer up?

38:56.557 --> 38:58.322
Why didn't you get a lawyer
to fight this thing?

38:58.324 --> 39:00.090
I don't understand.

39:00.092 --> 39:01.595
I don't know.

39:01.597 --> 39:03.595
I don't think there's any lawyer
who could change what I did.

39:03.597 --> 39:05.858
They... they could
get you off, Danny.

39:07.868 --> 39:09.497
All right, well, um...

39:09.499 --> 39:11.537
Look, I, uh, I've been
living with what I did,

39:11.539 --> 39:15.137
feeling a certain way
about it ever since I did it.

39:15.139 --> 39:17.936
Okay? And maybe some
crazy part of me just didn't

39:17.938 --> 39:20.207
want to feel
that way anymore.

39:20.209 --> 39:21.272
You know?
I guess.

39:21.274 --> 39:23.409
But that does not
mean that I am not

39:23.411 --> 39:26.249
happy and grateful that I am
here, so thank you, partner.

39:26.251 --> 39:29.584
You're the one who was ready to
go to jail to keep me out of it.

39:29.586 --> 39:31.288
I should be thanking you.

39:31.290 --> 39:33.386
That's what family does, right?

39:33.388 --> 39:34.596
Yeah.

39:34.598 --> 39:36.861
Danno.

39:36.863 --> 39:39.429
Speaking of which...
How do I look?

39:39.431 --> 39:42.069
You look great.
Thanks.

39:42.071 --> 39:44.743
Danno.

39:46.410 --> 39:48.577
Danno.

39:50.019 --> 39:53.420
Hey, hey.

39:54.894 --> 39:56.492
Hi.

39:56.494 --> 39:57.988
Hey.

39:57.990 --> 39:59.156
I missed you.

39:59.158 --> 40:01.364
I told you I was
coming home.

40:14.372 --> 40:17.806
We earned our Trident today.

40:17.808 --> 40:20.006
Hooyah.

40:26.184 --> 40:28.215
Steve, I know
you were surveilling me

40:28.217 --> 40:30.489
while I was in quarantine.

40:30.491 --> 40:33.520
And I can't say
I blame you, but...

40:33.522 --> 40:36.128
this suspicion has to stop.

40:36.130 --> 40:38.294
I need you to trust me.

40:40.264 --> 40:43.163
All right. Just give
me a reason, Joe.

40:43.165 --> 40:45.363
Well, I will,
if you give me a chance.

40:47.162 --> 40:48.496
All right.

40:48.498 --> 40:52.365
Good.
I appreciate that.

40:52.367 --> 40:53.827
You know, I'd, uh...

40:53.829 --> 40:56.866
I'd still like to
thank your contact.

40:56.868 --> 40:58.697
I mean, whoever gave you
that classified Intel

40:58.699 --> 41:01.840
on the refinery really
put themself on the line.

41:01.842 --> 41:03.536
Who owes you, Joe?

41:05.643 --> 41:09.445
It's not who owed me,
Steve, it's who owes you.

41:14.254 --> 41:17.019
It was your mother.

41:26.269 --> 41:29.368
That the real reason
I wasn't arrested with Danny?

41:29.370 --> 41:32.336
Yes.

42:02.541 --> 42:04.747
You're welcome.
