WEBVTT

02:02.247 --> 02:03.915
Jimmy?

02:06.584 --> 02:07.502
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:08.795 --> 02:09.796
<i>It's me.</i>

02:14.425 --> 02:16.261
I'm okay.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.462
TYRUS:
<i>You sure?</i>

04:15.463 --> 04:18.424
All right. Stay put, call me if there's a problem.

04:19.634 --> 04:23.805
Doesn't look like anyone's been down that road.
Definitely no one official.

04:23.888 --> 04:26.057
Bodies, trucks, it's all still there.

04:26.140 --> 04:30.019
A couple of flatbeds headed their way.
They'll clear it all out.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.480
Like it never happened.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.190
TYRUS:
And the one who followed you?

04:34.274 --> 04:37.485
We'll be damn lucky if we ever find that guy.

04:37.568 --> 04:41.114
Well, that'll have to do.
He's in the middle of nowhere.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.118
Don't go to sleep yet.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.704
We gotta work on your story.

04:49.247 --> 04:52.041
All right. Let's do it.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.265
De Guzman. Jorge.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.993
-Seven million dollars?
-Yep.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.730
I'm fine.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.900
Seven million.

05:59.901 --> 06:04.113
Your client has $7 million.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.698
Where'd it come from?

06:06.949 --> 06:10.369
It's not for me to ask
where a client gets his money.

06:12.246 --> 06:15.083
And just who exactly is your client?

06:16.709 --> 06:19.921
Jorge De Guzman.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.486
Yes, hello?

06:46.447 --> 06:48.449
This is extra.

06:55.039 --> 06:58.084
And now, Mr. De Guzman?

07:12.890 --> 07:17.019
Well. You must have a story.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.480
Car trouble. Yeah.

07:19.564 --> 07:23.651
Broke down about six miles from the pick-up site.

07:23.734 --> 07:26.737
You know there's no cell reception
out there, right?

07:28.197 --> 07:29.657
Car trouble.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.201
Yeah. Just kaput.

07:34.328 --> 07:35.746
So, um...

07:36.747 --> 07:39.917
Why so long?
It's not that far back to the main road.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.836
You didn't just hitchhike?

07:41.919 --> 07:44.672
I thought of that. But you know, 7 mil in cash,

07:44.755 --> 07:47.467
I was kind of afraid who might pick me up.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.427
I didn't think it was worth the risk.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.596
I walked north.

07:51.679 --> 07:58.519
Probably not the smartest move,
but after a night lost in the desert, I made it.

08:01.772 --> 08:05.401
Well, that was the right call.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.196
Hey. Hey. You did good, huh?

08:10.615 --> 08:14.452
Anyway, listen, I wouldn't be too happy.

08:14.535 --> 08:18.289
Seven mil, it really sent up a huge flare.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.082
They're looking into you.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.960
I don't know how long "Jorge De Guzman"
is gonna hold up.

08:23.044 --> 08:26.380
Hey, listen, by the time
these dipshits figure it out,

08:26.464 --> 08:29.675
I will be long gone, man.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.637
Back home in Mexico, you know?

08:34.055 --> 08:35.306
Yeah.

08:35.389 --> 08:39.477
Hey! Hey, hey. But don't worry.
You and me? We're not done.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.647
We're gonna do things. Big things.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.608
Friend of the cartel, right?

08:46.359 --> 08:48.152
-Right.
-Right.

08:54.825 --> 08:58.454
So hey, my cousins. They pay you?

08:59.455 --> 09:01.040
Yep.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.625
Perfecto.

09:02.708 --> 09:06.379
So make sure you buy something nice for the wife.
Man, she's a looker, huh?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.090
My-- My what?

09:09.173 --> 09:12.009
Yeah! She came by to see me.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.887
Hey, nice job, eh?

09:14.971 --> 09:18.057
I mean, for somebody who marries that far up...

09:19.058 --> 09:21.018
<i>Bien hecho, </i>man.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.104
Respect, you know?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.491
KIM:
Let me help.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.912
There.

09:44.333 --> 09:47.587
Oh, my God, Jimmy.
You need to go to an emergency room.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.841
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I cleaned it out real good at the truck stop.

09:51.924 --> 09:55.386
All right. Well, let's at least just go get you
an IV, huh? You're dehydrated.

09:55.469 --> 09:59.807
No. I don't need an IV.
I've been pounding sports drinks nonstop.

09:59.890 --> 10:03.519
-I'm really okay.
-All right.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.856
Come on, you're gonna get in this bath, though,
it'll help your skin.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.279
What is this? Cream of Wheat?

10:13.362 --> 10:16.282
Oatmeal. It's an oatmeal bath. Anti-inflammatory.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.243
It'll help your sunburn.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.629
-Is the temp okay?
-Yeah. It's good.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.672
You sure?

10:32.673 --> 10:33.841
Yeah.

10:34.842 --> 10:38.304
Okay. You don't want any food
or anything else to drink?

10:38.387 --> 10:39.930
No, I'm good.

10:40.014 --> 10:43.684
I just need to sit. This is good.

10:59.408 --> 11:03.037
I can't believe you walked
through the desert alone for 36 hours.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.956
I-- I can't even fathom it.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.584
That's right.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.213
All by myself.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.138
So...

11:23.432 --> 11:25.810
Is there anything you wanna tell me?

11:28.396 --> 11:30.064
-About?
-Lalo.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.817
You saw Lalo?

11:35.319 --> 11:36.821
Yeah.

11:37.905 --> 11:42.243
Jimmy, short of going to the police,
Lalo was the only lead I had to figure out--

11:42.326 --> 11:45.621
Kim, you have to stay away from people like Lalo.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.874
-Jimmy...
-You don't see Lalo.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.918
I see Lalo, okay?

11:51.001 --> 11:54.213
-I'm in the game. You're not in the game.
-What?

11:54.296 --> 11:56.006
The game?

11:57.007 --> 11:58.968
Listen, it was perfectly safe.

11:59.051 --> 12:02.847
I was at the MDC, surrounded by guards,
like any lawyer visiting a client, okay?

12:02.930 --> 12:04.390
But he's not your client.

12:04.473 --> 12:07.643
He's my client. So please, just keep away.

12:07.726 --> 12:10.896
Jimmy, I was worried about you.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.190
And I'm worried about you.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.235
Kim, when I was out there...

12:17.611 --> 12:20.239
I didn't think I was gonna make it.

12:20.322 --> 12:24.160
I thought I was done.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.539
I was that close to giving up.

12:29.748 --> 12:32.418
And the only thing that kept me going...

12:34.211 --> 12:36.589
was knowing that you were here.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.717
So...

12:41.802 --> 12:42.970
Okay.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.474
I won't see Lalo again.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.477
Good.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.646
Good.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.050
After all this...

13:22.843 --> 13:24.678
was it worth it?

13:30.059 --> 13:32.061
Go look in the bag.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.941
The bag in the living room.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.697
It's on the chair.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.950
It's a gray bag.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.192
You see it?

14:22.611 --> 14:24.405
Yeah, Jimmy.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.199
I see it.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.954
That's what it's all about.

14:49.513 --> 14:53.517
MIKE:
Six guys, three vehicles, heavily armed.

14:53.601 --> 14:57.771
My guess is they followed the Salamanca cousins
up from Chihuahua,

14:57.855 --> 15:01.400
trailing the money
but not wanting to take these two guys on.

15:01.483 --> 15:05.321
Now, I'm no expert, but they had tattoos.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.948
Same symbol I saw on a job back east.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.992
A Colombian gang.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.912
Draw it for me.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.982
These men were hired.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.610
By who?

16:05.464 --> 16:07.466
GUS :
<i>I trust you heard the good news.</i>

16:07.549 --> 16:10.052
Gustavo, which good news is that?

16:10.135 --> 16:14.556
Our colleague has been released
by the American authorities.

16:14.640 --> 16:19.520
At a substantial price, but he's free.

16:19.603 --> 16:23.607
And I'm told he will be returning home
to continue operations.

16:23.691 --> 16:27.778
That is good news. But coming south, you say?

16:27.861 --> 16:28.862
<i>That's correct.</i>

16:28.946 --> 16:33.075
Forfeiting bail is the only way
to assure he remains out of prison.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.369
<i>Well, then. All will be returning to normal.</i>

16:35.452 --> 16:40.040
<i>And I trust your run of bad luck</i>
<i>will be behind you.</i>

16:40.124 --> 16:41.709
Bad luck?

16:41.792 --> 16:45.838
<i>The DEA. The fire. The arrest.</i>

16:47.131 --> 16:48.799
My hope is that it's over.

16:50.217 --> 16:53.971
Yes. I believe the coming weeks
will be our best yet.

16:54.054 --> 16:57.057
<i>Excellent. I'll pass on the good news.</i>

16:58.559 --> 17:01.270
Thank you. Enjoy your evening.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.862
I just spoke to the man
responsible for the attack.

17:11.613 --> 17:14.366
Someone we need to worry about?

17:14.450 --> 17:17.578
He was trying to protect his own business

17:17.661 --> 17:19.788
by protecting our business.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.000
If that's him trying to help...

17:23.083 --> 17:25.753
He knows nothing
of what we are trying to accomplish.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.882
Once Salamanca is south of the border,

17:29.965 --> 17:33.719
our actions must be unimpeachable.

17:33.802 --> 17:38.390
Any reflection on me
will not be greeted with kindness.

17:39.516 --> 17:40.976
All right.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.693
Yes?

17:51.278 --> 17:53.864
There's one other thing we should discuss.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.703
Nacho Varga. He wants out.

18:00.579 --> 18:04.249
He's done everything we asked,
he held up his end.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.086
I think it's time we cut him loose.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.296
I see no reason to give up an asset.

18:09.379 --> 18:13.175
Once Salamanca's dealt with,
we have no use for Varga.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.427
He's the only guy they have
running things up here.

18:15.511 --> 18:19.723
He disappears, Salamanca operation falls apart.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.398
Varga stays.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.819
Better to control the opposition
without their knowledge.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.407
You have a gun to his father's head.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.785
That doesn't sit with me.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.413
You wanna keep Varga for the long run,

18:44.414 --> 18:47.626
I don't think fear is a great motivator.

18:50.629 --> 18:56.260
A dog who bites every owner he's had...

18:57.553 --> 19:00.389
can only disciplined with a firm hand.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.809
Or put down.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.448
He's taking care of business tonight.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.577
Tomorrow morning,
he's seeing Hector to say goodbye.

19:22.661 --> 19:25.539
Um, after that, I drive him south.
He didn't tell me where.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.624
All I know is I'm dropping him off

19:27.708 --> 19:31.295
and somebody else is taking him over the border.

19:31.378 --> 19:32.588
TYRUS :
<i>Is that it?</i>

19:32.671 --> 19:35.257
Yeah. Hey, um...

19:37.176 --> 19:41.346
Once he's down, that's it, right? He's done?

19:43.223 --> 19:45.559
<i>Just do what you're told. Don't worry about it.</i>

20:05.245 --> 20:06.121
Hey.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.207
Hungry?

20:09.208 --> 20:14.129
You good with cereal?
Or you want me to try an omelet?

20:15.214 --> 20:18.675
Uh, cereal.
Probably the safest thing for my stomach.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.552
-Okay.
-I'll get it.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.638
No, no, no. I got it. Just...

20:22.721 --> 20:25.265
Just relax.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.735
You going in late today?

20:37.819 --> 20:41.698
Uh, I just thought I'd stay home today.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.994
Kim, I can take care of myself.

20:46.078 --> 20:50.624
Well, I already called in sick,
so you're stuck with me.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.162
Oh! Damn it!

21:30.372 --> 21:31.623
Shit.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.709
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.920
I guess my stomach's just not ready for this yet.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.258
It's okay.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.679
Not a big deal.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.491
Are you sure you don't have to go in to work?

22:06.575 --> 22:09.911
Yeah, I'm sure. We both need to take it easy.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.955
How about a day without drama?

22:13.123 --> 22:15.125
That sounds real good, actually.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.587
HILDY:
<i>Oh, hi, Skinny.</i>

22:18.670 --> 22:20.964
-<i>Hello, Ruth.</i>
RUTH: <i>Well, Maisie's here.</i>

22:21.048 --> 22:23.342
HILDY: <i>How are you?</i>
<i>Tell me, is the lord of the universe in?</i>

22:23.425 --> 22:26.595
MAISIE: <i>Yes, he's in, in a bad humor.</i>
<i>Somebody must have stolen the crown jewel.</i>

22:26.678 --> 22:29.806
<i>-Shall we announce you?</i>
HILDY: <i>Oh, no, no. I'll blow my own horn.</i>

22:29.890 --> 22:32.517
<i>Bruce, you should better wait here.</i>
<i>I'll be back in 10 minutes.</i>

22:32.601 --> 22:35.771
BRUCE: <i>Even 10 minutes is a long time</i>
<i>to be away from you.</i>

22:36.772 --> 22:38.940
HILDY:<i> What did you say?</i>
BRUCE: <i>What?</i>

22:39.941 --> 22:41.693
<i>-Well...</i>
<i>-Go on.</i>

22:43.153 --> 22:44.279
<i>Well, go ahead.</i>

22:44.362 --> 22:47.783
BRUCE: <i>Well, I just said, even 10 minutes</i>
<i>is a long time to be away from you.</i>

22:47.866 --> 22:51.995
HILDY: <i>I heard you the first time.</i>
<i>I like it, that's why I asked you to say it again.</i>

22:52.079 --> 22:55.749
<i>I can stand being spoiled. The gentleman</i>
<i>I'm going in to see did very little spoiling.</i>

22:55.832 --> 22:58.960
BRUCE: <i>I'd like to spoil him just once.</i>
<i>You sure you don't want me to go with you?</i>

22:59.044 --> 23:02.214
HILDY:<i> Oh, no. I can handle it.</i>
<i>-Well, if things get rough, remember I'm here.</i>

23:06.635 --> 23:08.386
<i>Hi, Hildy. Welcome back.</i>

23:08.470 --> 23:11.348
Saul Goodman. Speedy justice for you.

23:13.391 --> 23:18.730
I'm sorry. No. Today-- It's impossible today.
I can't help you.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.109
Yeah, that's right.

23:26.613 --> 23:29.491
Uh, wait, what are they saying?

23:30.992 --> 23:32.202
Are you--?

23:32.285 --> 23:34.704
Just wait 45 minutes. I can be there.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.456
What? Jimmy, no.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.667
Yeah. You tell them I'm on my way.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.711
Jimmy. Jimmy.

23:41.795 --> 23:44.047
You can barely walk. What are you doing?

23:44.131 --> 23:46.633
It's my client. He's in big trouble.

23:47.926 --> 23:51.680
They're trying to kill his plea deal
because his buddy was carrying weed.

23:51.763 --> 23:52.639
What? Okay.

23:52.722 --> 23:55.600
So get a continuance.
You don't have to do this today.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.352
No, this guy's scared out of his mind.

23:57.435 --> 24:00.313
I wouldn't feel right leaving him hanging.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.900
Jimmy, look, I know you're lying.

24:08.196 --> 24:12.492
And I know something terrible
happened in the desert.

24:15.036 --> 24:18.123
This isn't about our deal,
I'm not insisting or forcing you to tell me.

24:18.206 --> 24:19.583
I just...

24:21.585 --> 24:25.672
want you to know that I'm here for you.

24:30.177 --> 24:33.054
And you can tell me, okay?

24:34.055 --> 24:35.557
No judgments.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.229
No judgments.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.445
You're right.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.490
Something did happen out there.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.538
When I was in the desert...

25:01.583 --> 25:04.211
I had to drink my own pee.

25:05.712 --> 25:11.051
I was out of water,
and in order to survive, I had to drink pee.

25:12.177 --> 25:15.555
Well... Yeah, that's it, so...

25:16.890 --> 25:19.976
And there you go. Look...

25:21.186 --> 25:24.022
I will recover,
and we never need to mention this again.

25:24.105 --> 25:27.317
I'm gonna go get changed,
and I'm gonna get down there.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.379
Kim. Feeling better?

25:47.462 --> 25:50.215
Oh, yeah. Just a 24-hour thing. It passed.

25:50.298 --> 25:52.842
I thought I should come in
and prep the Colorado meeting.

25:52.926 --> 25:55.971
Oh. They moved that up to this morning.
Stef handled it.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.098
There was no pushback from Boulder city council?

25:58.181 --> 26:01.977
Stef cleared up the conditional use issue.
Everything's moving forward.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.145
Wow, that's great.

26:05.438 --> 26:06.481
Great.

26:07.774 --> 26:09.401
Well, uh...

26:11.111 --> 26:11.945
Okay.

26:12.028 --> 26:15.740
You wanted to write letters
to the planning board in Broomfield.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.326
Right. Yes, that's right.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.954
I'll get started on that,
if you can just get me those names.

26:21.037 --> 26:24.374
-List is on your desk.
-Of course. Great.

26:28.712 --> 26:34.009
First letter is for Mr. Armand Bakaris,
chairman of the Planning and Zoning Commission,

26:34.092 --> 26:36.886
and let's just CC the vice chair,

26:36.970 --> 26:39.264
Elaine Perlman, while we're at it.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.350
Dear Mr. Bakaris,

26:42.434 --> 26:47.480
Mesa Verde Bank and Trust respectfully submit
the following request for your consideration.

26:47.564 --> 26:50.817
In regards to the resolution number...

26:51.818 --> 26:56.906
PZ 2004-dash-36 variance appeal

26:56.990 --> 27:02.495
to allow for a six-and-one-half foot encroachment
into the...

27:04.998 --> 27:08.001
Into the minimum required rear setback...

27:15.091 --> 27:20.221
Um, minimum required rear setback for a...

27:21.264 --> 27:23.683
drive-thru awning to allow...

27:23.767 --> 27:26.311
Strike that. To facilitate...

27:27.520 --> 27:31.733
access to the property at...

27:34.944 --> 27:36.613
841 North.

27:37.781 --> 27:42.327
So can you call his assistant and get some intel
on what he's into right now?

27:42.410 --> 27:45.622
Kim, they told me you were out sick today.

27:45.705 --> 27:49.918
Yeah. No, I, uh... Rich, you free to talk?

27:50.001 --> 27:51.211
Yeah, is everything okay?

27:51.294 --> 27:54.047
Yeah. I just need a minute.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.590
Okay.

28:00.678 --> 28:03.765
So, what's up?

28:03.848 --> 28:05.100
KIM:
I...

28:13.274 --> 28:14.359
What?

28:30.959 --> 28:33.461
Marcie, can you do me a favor?

28:33.545 --> 28:36.381
Copy all the pro bono files
and send the originals to my place.

28:36.464 --> 28:40.260
Also, no rush, but
box up my diplomas and photos, please.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.387
Are we moving offices?

28:42.470 --> 28:46.099
I don't want you to worry. I talked to Rich,
you'll be reassigned to another partner.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.267
Wait, reassigned?

28:47.350 --> 28:50.103
Oh, and they're gonna want these.

28:51.104 --> 28:54.107
I'm parked in my usual spot.

28:54.190 --> 28:58.486
If I left anything else in there,
just put it in the box.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.073
Thank you, Marcie.

29:03.074 --> 29:05.285
-Good luck.
-Kim...

29:29.476 --> 29:30.852
LALO

30:37.126 --> 30:38.503
WOMAN:
Hi, there.

30:38.586 --> 30:41.631
We're bringing birthday cake out
for Louise, one of our residents.

30:41.714 --> 30:45.093
Everyone's going to sing.
Hector really doesn't like to miss these.

30:45.176 --> 30:49.013
Yeah. Could you give us a minute, please?

31:17.083 --> 31:18.668
Okay, guys.

31:21.170 --> 31:25.258
ALL:
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

31:25.341 --> 31:29.012
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

31:29.095 --> 31:33.933
♪ Happy birthday dear Louise ♪

31:34.017 --> 31:37.937
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪♪

32:01.210 --> 32:02.462
Where to?

32:03.463 --> 32:05.340
Go. The border.

32:33.409 --> 32:37.622
Hey, that was something. What happened in there?

32:37.705 --> 32:40.166
Hey, look, don't feel bad. You can't win them all.

32:40.249 --> 32:43.586
But that one? Sheesh, I thought for sure
I was gonna lose.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.214
There wasn't a chance in hell
I was supposed to win that one.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.007
But there you were.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.718
Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.

32:51.719 --> 32:54.472
Ball in your hand, at the goal line,

32:54.555 --> 32:56.140
fumble!

32:56.224 --> 32:59.852
Law students are gonna review
the "Goodman Debacle" as a teachable moment.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.187
So at least there's that.

33:02.188 --> 33:04.857
And think of all the kids you'll help learn
what not to do

33:04.941 --> 33:06.901
when faced with underwhelming odds.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.444
So embarrassing.

33:08.528 --> 33:11.364
You'll probably have to change your name. Again.

33:21.124 --> 33:25.420
Hey, just so you know,
I don't think any less of you.

33:25.503 --> 33:28.881
You're still a lawyer.

34:04.333 --> 34:07.253
You can start talking any time.

34:08.546 --> 34:12.967
You said this goes away.
So, what's the time frame on that?

34:16.971 --> 34:19.807
It's different for different people, I suppose.

34:20.892 --> 34:24.771
For me. When will this be over for me?

34:27.315 --> 34:29.859
Well, here's what's gonna happen.

34:29.942 --> 34:31.486
One day...

34:31.569 --> 34:33.905
One day, you're gonna wake up,

34:33.988 --> 34:38.076
eat your breakfast, brush your teeth,
go about your business.

34:39.952 --> 34:42.288
And sooner or later,

34:42.371 --> 34:44.957
you're gonna realize

34:45.041 --> 34:46.793
you haven't thought about it.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.420
None of it.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.592
And that's the moment

34:54.675 --> 34:56.636
you realize you can forget.

34:57.637 --> 35:01.599
When you know that's possible, it all gets easier.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.976
But what about you? Like...

35:04.060 --> 35:06.229
What happened out there doesn't bother you?

35:07.230 --> 35:11.442
Them wanting to steal the 7 million
didn't work for me.

35:11.526 --> 35:14.737
Not to mention, they wanted to shoot you
in the head.

35:14.821 --> 35:18.407
It was them or it was us. Cut and dried.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.953
They were in the game.

35:26.749 --> 35:28.376
What about Fred?

35:29.460 --> 35:30.753
From Travel Wire.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.381
Was he in the game?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.843
No.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.680
There was a lot wrong with what happened there.

35:40.763 --> 35:42.056
Yeah. Lalo.

35:43.057 --> 35:47.186
Lalo killed that guy. And for what?

35:47.270 --> 35:50.356
He killed that guy, and we're helping him.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.779
All this shit, just to...

35:57.822 --> 36:01.325
So he can get out of jail and just get away?

36:02.410 --> 36:04.579
It's not the end of the story.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.082
Wait a minute. What does that mean?

36:08.166 --> 36:11.586
Uh, "not the end of the story."
What are you saying?

36:11.669 --> 36:15.423
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Something gonna happen to Lalo?

36:15.506 --> 36:17.675
I didn't say that.

36:17.758 --> 36:21.971
Oh, Jesus. What have I gotten myself
involved with here?

36:22.054 --> 36:26.225
-Look, just tell me, what are you saying--
-Look.

36:27.268 --> 36:30.396
We all make our choices.

36:30.479 --> 36:34.192
Now those choices, they put us on a road.

36:34.275 --> 36:38.946
Sometimes those choices seem small,
but they put you on the road.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.782
You think about getting off.

36:43.242 --> 36:45.661
But eventually, you're back on it.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.789
And the road we're on led us out to the desert,

36:48.873 --> 36:50.583
and everything that happened there,

36:50.666 --> 36:54.837
and straight back to where we are right now.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.715
And nothing...

36:59.008 --> 37:02.094
Nothing can be done about that.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.224
Do you understand that?

37:10.811 --> 37:13.064
I can't believe...

37:14.482 --> 37:18.569
I can't believe there's, like,
over a billion people on this planet,

37:18.653 --> 37:22.281
and the only person
I have to talk about this to is you.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.245
You want me to wait?

38:52.246 --> 38:53.622
Nah.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.166
They'll be here.

38:55.249 --> 38:57.335
Really. Go.

38:59.712 --> 39:00.629
You sure?

39:00.713 --> 39:02.590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.008
Look, I'll be in touch, man.

39:04.091 --> 39:06.510
Hey, that fire you did at Fring's...

39:07.803 --> 39:09.680
That was good work, man.

39:09.764 --> 39:10.848
We're gonna do more.

39:15.227 --> 39:16.395
Sounds good.

39:39.877 --> 39:43.214
Take me back up the road. Slow.

39:47.343 --> 39:48.344
What for?

39:48.427 --> 39:51.514
Just do it. Six or seven miles back.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.030
NACHO:
What are we looking for?

40:09.115 --> 40:11.742
The lawyer said his car broke down.

40:13.577 --> 40:17.415
Six miles from the pick-up. Where is it?

40:22.795 --> 40:25.506
Whoa, whoa, whoa, let me out here. Let me out.

41:41.499 --> 41:42.583
Come.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.710
Back to Albuquerque.

41:48.797 --> 41:50.424
What about Marco and Leonel?

41:50.508 --> 41:53.802
What about them? I'll get them a message.
Let's go.

42:39.598 --> 42:40.516
Jimmy?

42:43.394 --> 42:44.311
You okay?

42:48.983 --> 42:50.901
Yeah, what time is it?

42:50.985 --> 42:53.404
It's 6:30.

42:55.030 --> 42:57.074
Oh, sorry. You wanna go back to sleep?

42:57.157 --> 43:00.244
No. I'm up.

43:03.080 --> 43:06.542
You can still go to a doctor, you know?
No harm in getting checked out.

43:07.626 --> 43:09.587
I'm fine.

43:09.670 --> 43:13.090
I think I just need food.

43:13.173 --> 43:16.343
I haven't eaten since, uh...

43:16.427 --> 43:19.638
well, really, before everything.

43:19.722 --> 43:21.140
Okay.

43:21.223 --> 43:24.727
Maybe go easy. Just some soup at first.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.937
I'm okay, Kim. Really.

43:27.980 --> 43:28.814
I know.

43:30.149 --> 43:31.400
Good.

43:31.483 --> 43:32.985
Good.

43:34.528 --> 43:36.322
What about you? You seem...

43:37.531 --> 43:39.742
worried, maybe?

43:40.743 --> 43:43.162
No. No, no. It's just...

43:44.163 --> 43:46.665
I have news, but it can wait.

43:46.749 --> 43:49.043
-Let's get some food in you first.
-What news?

43:49.126 --> 43:52.880
-What kind of news?
-Nothing bad.

43:54.256 --> 43:57.718
So that means it's good news?

43:59.595 --> 44:01.305
Yeah. I think so.

44:02.306 --> 44:04.141
Great. Let me hear it.

44:09.063 --> 44:11.815
I, uh...

44:11.899 --> 44:14.818
quit Schweikart and Cokely.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.697
And I gave up Mesa Verde.

44:22.534 --> 44:24.662
How about we get some food together?

44:26.163 --> 44:26.997
Wait.

44:28.791 --> 44:31.460
What happened? Did somebody
say something about what we did?

44:31.543 --> 44:32.628
-No.
-What, was it Rich?

44:32.711 --> 44:36.924
Nobody said anything. It just, it felt right.

44:37.007 --> 44:38.884
"It felt right." What? How?

44:38.967 --> 44:39.968
I...

44:40.052 --> 44:45.933
I just-- I keep pushing Mesa Verde away
to do my pro bono work, and then...

44:46.934 --> 44:48.227
when you were gone,

44:48.310 --> 44:51.689
I didn't know what happened. I mean, I...

44:51.772 --> 44:55.317
I thought you were dead. So...

44:56.402 --> 44:59.780
That was, um... All of it helped me.

44:59.863 --> 45:02.491
To see what's important and what isn't.

45:04.701 --> 45:08.914
So you're just gonna throw it all away?
I mean, you busted your ass for all of it.

45:08.997 --> 45:12.209
I'm not throwing it away. I did S&C.

45:12.292 --> 45:15.587
I did Mesa Verde. I achieved that.

45:15.671 --> 45:19.758
I have that experience,
but it doesn't make me happy.

45:20.926 --> 45:23.554
Look, it's been a rough couple of days.

45:23.637 --> 45:26.473
So why don't you just hold off
on a final decision?

45:26.557 --> 45:28.600
Call Rich, tell him you're thinking it over.

45:28.684 --> 45:31.728
I already talked to Rich. And I called Paige.

45:31.812 --> 45:35.441
We had a nice, very long conversation. It's done.

45:35.524 --> 45:38.277
Then I spent the afternoon
in the courthouse with pro bono clients

45:38.360 --> 45:40.362
without Mesa Verde hanging over my head.

45:40.446 --> 45:42.656
Best afternoon I've had in a long time.

45:42.739 --> 45:44.450
All right, pro bono is wonderful.

45:44.533 --> 45:47.661
It is, but pro bono means no money.

45:47.744 --> 45:49.413
So what's the plan here?

45:50.497 --> 45:53.041
I don't know. But I'll figure it out.

45:53.125 --> 45:57.296
Okay. Leaving Schweikart, I get that.
It's a bunch of stuffed shirts.

45:57.379 --> 45:59.298
But Mesa Verde?

45:59.381 --> 46:03.385
That's like leaving the Yankees
to play amateur ring toss.

46:03.469 --> 46:08.223
No, it's not. I'm leaving something
that makes zero difference in the world

46:08.307 --> 46:10.726
to help people who are actually in need.

46:12.019 --> 46:14.021
This is a bad idea.

46:14.104 --> 46:15.522
What?

46:15.606 --> 46:18.317
Look. We all make choices, right?

46:18.400 --> 46:21.069
And those choices, they put us on a road.

46:21.153 --> 46:23.947
And the road has good choices,
and it has bad choices.

46:24.031 --> 46:27.242
This is a bad choice road.

46:28.452 --> 46:30.287
-What are you even talking about?
-I'm--

46:31.371 --> 46:33.999
Saying that bad choices lead to bad roads

46:34.082 --> 46:36.293
that lead to bad places.

46:37.711 --> 46:42.007
When you decided to be Saul Goodman,
I didn't get it.

46:42.090 --> 46:43.759
Still don't, really.

46:43.842 --> 46:45.886
But I stood by your decision.

46:45.969 --> 46:48.347
And I'm not changing my identity,
I'm just leaving a job.

46:48.430 --> 46:50.432
What I did was completely different.

46:50.516 --> 46:53.185
-How?
-Because I was leaving failure for success.

46:53.268 --> 46:56.772
It's not different.
You believed it was right for you.

46:56.855 --> 46:59.650
Give me the courtesy of believing
this is right for me.

46:59.733 --> 47:03.070
And I am giving you a reality check.
This is too far, too fast.

47:03.153 --> 47:07.824
And I'm giving you a reality check.
This is really none of your damn business.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.628
-Yeah?
MIKE : <i>Listen to me.</i>

47:19.711 --> 47:22.923
<i>Put your phone down. Leave it on, so I can hear.</i>

47:23.006 --> 47:24.841
So you can hear-- Hear what?

47:24.925 --> 47:27.427
Do what I said right now.

47:27.511 --> 47:30.180
Put it down somewhere it can't be seen.

47:33.892 --> 47:35.227
Jimmy.

47:49.741 --> 47:51.034
Hey, guys.

47:52.119 --> 47:53.453
Can I come in?

47:55.956 --> 47:57.124
SAUL:
Lalo.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.127
Thought you'd be down south.

48:00.210 --> 48:01.712
Enjoying your freedom.

48:01.795 --> 48:03.797
Yeah, well...

48:04.798 --> 48:06.758
Had some business to attend to.

48:08.135 --> 48:09.595
Told you he'd be back.

48:10.596 --> 48:13.390
Nice. I like it.

48:14.808 --> 48:18.770
Hey, look, you want a drink?
We got some beer in the fridge.

48:18.854 --> 48:20.439
Unless you're not staying that...

48:22.524 --> 48:24.735
You shouldn't-- I'm sorry. Um...

48:25.944 --> 48:31.033
Sorry, you shouldn't do that. It upsets the fish.

48:48.842 --> 48:51.303
Look, you wanna talk, we can talk.

48:51.386 --> 48:53.639
But Kim's just stepping out, so...

48:53.722 --> 48:56.183
Nah. She can stay.

48:57.225 --> 49:01.438
I mean, she's part of the legal team, right?

49:03.398 --> 49:06.526
Hey, relax, sit down. We're just gonna talk.

49:07.611 --> 49:10.530
Come on. Sit.

49:13.533 --> 49:14.868
Okay.

49:23.335 --> 49:24.586
So...

49:26.713 --> 49:28.215
Tell me what happened.

49:29.758 --> 49:31.176
What happened?

49:31.259 --> 49:34.513
Yeah, when you picked up the money.

49:34.596 --> 49:38.141
Just walk me through it.

49:40.519 --> 49:42.396
What I told you already?

49:43.772 --> 49:44.773
Yes.

49:48.443 --> 49:51.571
Fine. I picked up the money from your cousins.

49:51.655 --> 49:54.700
It was right where you told me it would be.

49:54.783 --> 49:58.328
Driving back, my car crapped out.

49:58.412 --> 50:02.416
It was about six or seven miles
from the pick-up site.

50:02.499 --> 50:04.543
There's no phone service.

50:04.626 --> 50:06.920
So I walked north.

50:07.003 --> 50:08.922
Through the desert all night.

50:09.005 --> 50:10.841
Well, I slept a little.

50:10.924 --> 50:15.303
But then in the morning, I walked again,
until I made it to a truck stop.

50:15.387 --> 50:17.639
I went into the bathroom and cleaned up.

50:17.723 --> 50:21.977
I bought some clothes, and I called a cab.

50:22.060 --> 50:25.439
And delivered the money,
took them a couple of hours to count it.

50:26.440 --> 50:29.693
Usual rigmarole, and then I saw you.

50:38.452 --> 50:39.995
Tell me again.

50:41.621 --> 50:42.622
What?

50:43.665 --> 50:47.043
Tell me again.

50:58.930 --> 51:05.228
I picked up the money
from those two, uh, fine gentlemen.

51:06.229 --> 51:10.317
My car broke down after about just 10 minutes.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.319
There's no phone service.

51:12.402 --> 51:16.948
And I was afraid to hitchhike
because of how much money was.

51:17.949 --> 51:21.203
And I ran out of water.

51:21.286 --> 51:23.997
So I had to drink my own pee.

51:25.373 --> 51:28.960
A lot of it. So you wanted details, there you go.

51:29.044 --> 51:32.714
And then I finally made it to a truck stop.

51:32.798 --> 51:35.592
I called a cab. Then I waited.

51:35.675 --> 51:38.428
And then he took me directly to the courthouse.

51:38.512 --> 51:40.013
I paid your bail and I got you out.

51:40.096 --> 51:43.517
I'm not sure what you're looking for here, but...

51:44.518 --> 51:46.144
there you go.

51:49.856 --> 51:51.733
I just wanna hear the story.

51:54.528 --> 51:57.989
Lalo, this is exactly what he told me,
so if you could just--

51:58.073 --> 51:59.324
Shh.

52:02.494 --> 52:04.788
I just like to hear the story.

52:05.997 --> 52:07.040
I mean...

52:09.125 --> 52:11.837
I paid a lot of money for that story,

52:11.920 --> 52:14.506
so I think I can hear it as much as I want.

52:24.683 --> 52:26.101
So...

52:28.353 --> 52:29.855
tell me again.

52:34.901 --> 52:38.280
I picked up two big bags of money.

52:38.363 --> 52:40.782
Seven million dollars.

52:41.783 --> 52:45.036
<i>Two heavy, heavy bags that you paid me to get.</i>

52:46.496 --> 52:49.624
<i>I put them in the trunk of my car.</i>

52:49.708 --> 52:53.295
<i>And about 10 minutes later,</i>

52:53.378 --> 52:55.630
my car's engine went.

52:55.714 --> 53:00.218
Uh, I tried to fix it but it was overheated
or something.

53:00.302 --> 53:05.390
<i>So I walked north through the desert.</i>
<i>I walked and I walked and I walked,</i>

53:05.473 --> 53:08.310
with those heavy, heavy bags.

53:09.311 --> 53:14.065
I walked and I walked and I walked,
and I finally made it to a truck stop.

53:14.149 --> 53:15.817
And I went right to the bathroom,

53:15.901 --> 53:18.320
and I stuck my head under the faucet,

53:18.403 --> 53:21.156
and I bought a giant pack of energy drinks,

53:21.239 --> 53:24.075
and I called a taxi, and I waited.

53:26.244 --> 53:28.622
I don't know what the problem is, but...

53:29.748 --> 53:32.125
can she leave here?

53:32.208 --> 53:34.044
She doesn't need to be here.

53:34.127 --> 53:37.172
She had nothing to do with it. It was me.

53:37.255 --> 53:38.798
It was all me.

53:39.799 --> 53:42.427
-It was all you, huh?
-Yeah.

53:46.598 --> 53:48.558
What'd you do, Saul? Hmm?

53:49.643 --> 53:51.478
Whatever you think I did.

53:52.854 --> 53:56.191
-I don't really know. I just--
-I saw your car.

53:58.735 --> 54:01.947
-Okay.
-You push it in a ditch?

54:02.030 --> 54:03.782
I what?

54:03.865 --> 54:06.534
Did you push it in a ditch?

54:08.328 --> 54:10.622
-I don't think so.
-You don't think so?

54:10.705 --> 54:13.541
Well, I mean, you either did or you didn't.

54:13.625 --> 54:16.711
So which one is it?

54:19.798 --> 54:22.384
I don't know what you want.
Do you want the money back?

54:22.467 --> 54:25.178
Because it's in a bag in the other room.
You can take it.

54:25.261 --> 54:27.597
I just want what happened.

54:27.681 --> 54:30.350
-I told you what happened.
-Did you?

54:32.268 --> 54:33.895
Look, okay--

54:33.979 --> 54:36.147
Are you-- Are you kidding me with this?

54:36.231 --> 54:38.775
-Kim...
-Do you know what he did for you?

54:38.858 --> 54:41.277
Seven million dollars of your money.

54:41.361 --> 54:45.490
He hauled it across a goddamn desert
without one penny missing.

54:45.573 --> 54:47.909
And he got you out of jail for a murder that,

54:47.993 --> 54:50.245
let's face it, you're definitely guilty of.

54:50.328 --> 54:52.163
He did everything you asked.

54:52.247 --> 54:56.751
<i>And went way beyond what any other lawyer</i>
<i>would ever do.</i>

54:56.835 --> 54:59.295
So, what exactly is it that you're getting at?

54:59.379 --> 55:01.047
What do you want?

55:05.719 --> 55:07.804
I found his car in a ravine.

55:09.097 --> 55:10.390
Bullet holes on the side.

55:11.725 --> 55:15.770
So I'm just waiting to hear how that happened.

55:18.898 --> 55:20.108
Bullet holes.

55:22.652 --> 55:23.862
That's it?

55:25.238 --> 55:28.408
Uh-- Look, I don't know what it's like
where you're from.

55:28.491 --> 55:29.784
But here in New Mexico,

55:29.868 --> 55:32.620
you leave a soda can out,
someone's taking a shot at it.

55:32.704 --> 55:35.749
That-- That's what you're on about?

55:35.832 --> 55:38.418
<i>You don't think it's possible</i>
<i>a couple of yahoos with guns</i>

55:38.501 --> 55:41.171
<i>shot up a piece of junk car</i>
<i>and then rolled it down in a ditch?</i>

55:41.254 --> 55:42.672
End of story?

55:44.215 --> 55:47.510
What kind of operation are you running, anyway?

55:47.594 --> 55:48.970
Tell me.

55:49.054 --> 55:52.057
Because I think I know why you sent him
to do this job.

55:53.058 --> 55:54.642
It's obvious.

55:54.726 --> 55:57.729
You have no one else you can trust.

55:58.730 --> 55:59.898
Right?

55:59.981 --> 56:05.111
So you sent some lawyer through the desert
with your seven million bucks?

56:05.195 --> 56:09.824
That-- I-- No offense,
but you need to get your house in order.

56:10.825 --> 56:14.079
-Really?
-Yeah. Really.

56:14.162 --> 56:16.414
If you don't trust your men with your money,

56:16.498 --> 56:19.751
you have bigger problems
than if you trust Saul Goodman.

56:21.961 --> 56:24.339
And for the record, he doesn't lie.

56:24.422 --> 56:28.885
Not to me. Not to his clients.
He's telling you the truth.

56:30.595 --> 56:34.099
But next time you have a bunch of money
and no one you can trust,

56:34.182 --> 56:36.142
leave him out of it. Okay?

56:36.226 --> 56:38.311
Try a wire transfer.

56:38.394 --> 56:41.022
Try a shell company, or...

56:41.106 --> 56:42.899
You've heard of the Cayman Islands, right?

56:42.982 --> 56:45.276
Jesus, get your shit together.

56:45.360 --> 56:50.281
And stop torturing the one man
who went through hell to save your ass.

58:09.027 --> 58:10.487
What now?

58:12.363 --> 58:13.948
Mexico.

58:17.285 --> 58:19.204
Back to the same place?

58:20.246 --> 58:23.708
Nope. Change of plans.

58:28.963 --> 58:31.090
Come on, Ignacio, go.

58:31.174 --> 58:34.469
We got a long way ahead of us.
