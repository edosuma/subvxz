WEBVTT

00:00.029 --> 00:03.101
This could be the turning
point in our lives.

00:03.267 --> 00:05.638
The Great Hawaiian
Adventure Company!

00:09.239 --> 00:10.842
You don't know what it's
like not to fit in.

00:10.908 --> 00:13.046
Don't you talk to me
about not understanding.

00:13.111 --> 00:15.615
You think I don't know how it
feels to be lonely and scared?

00:15.681 --> 00:16.682
Champagne?

00:16.749 --> 00:17.750
Uh, great.

00:18.350 --> 00:19.485
Ah!

00:20.586 --> 00:21.587
Bryant's been arrested.

00:21.654 --> 00:22.655
We have him in custody.

02:16.296 --> 02:17.364
Go!

02:19.569 --> 02:21.072
Come on, come on! Go!

02:31.800 --> 02:32.835
Let's go!

02:37.706 --> 02:39.108
Put your hands
where we can see them.

02:39.174 --> 02:40.977
You have the right
to remain silent.

02:41.043 --> 02:42.947
You have the right
to an attorney.

02:43.013 --> 02:44.415
If you can't afford an attorney,

02:44.480 --> 02:46.484
the court will
appoint one for you.

02:46.550 --> 02:48.620
Do you have any questions?

02:49.753 --> 02:52.926
You were very lucky
this time, son, believe me.

02:52.990 --> 02:54.158
Three weeks of community service

02:54.224 --> 02:56.027
is a lot better than doing time,

02:56.093 --> 02:57.229
even at Juvie.

02:58.130 --> 02:59.900
Just give this to the
officer at the front desk.

02:59.965 --> 03:01.267
They'll release your
son to your custody.

03:01.332 --> 03:02.668
Thanks. Let's go.

03:02.734 --> 03:04.871
I'm sorry, Dad.
It won't happen again.

03:05.604 --> 03:07.140
It happens over and over.

03:07.539 --> 03:08.808
He tells you,
"Meet me here at 3:OO,"

03:08.875 --> 03:09.977
and he comes
strolling in here at 4:OO.

03:10.043 --> 03:11.679
Well, I'm gonna tell you
something, this is the last time

03:11.744 --> 03:12.979
I sit around here
and wait for him.

03:13.046 --> 03:14.950
Oh, I doubt
if it's the last time.

03:15.015 --> 03:17.954
We've been threatening him with
"last times" for lots of years.

03:18.619 --> 03:20.021
Well, there comes a time
in every man's life

03:20.087 --> 03:21.690
when you have to
make some changes.

03:27.028 --> 03:28.831
Hey, how's he doing?

03:29.397 --> 03:31.701
What's it like to have your son
with you after all these years?

03:31.766 --> 03:32.969
Have you seen Magnum?

03:33.035 --> 03:34.571
No. We're waiting
for him. He's late.

03:34.637 --> 03:36.340
He left an urgent
message at the estate.

03:36.405 --> 03:38.542
Said it was imperative
that I meet him here.

03:38.608 --> 03:40.144
That's the same message I got.

03:40.209 --> 03:41.244
Well, imperative or not,

03:41.310 --> 03:43.247
I have to be at the post
office before three.

03:43.312 --> 03:45.115
They're holding a registered
letter from my publisher.

03:45.182 --> 03:47.120
The first set of notes
on my memoirs.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.225
Hey, I hope it's good news.

03:48.252 --> 03:50.657
Yeah, so do I.
I've got plans, too.

03:50.722 --> 03:51.857
Again?

03:51.923 --> 03:54.194
You seem to have left work
early every day this week.

03:54.259 --> 03:55.260
Yeah.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.430
You've been looking
pretty good, lately.

03:57.495 --> 03:58.965
So? What's wrong with that?

04:00.132 --> 04:01.802
What's her name? Oh, come on.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.503
Why is it that every
time I have plans,

04:03.569 --> 04:05.649
you seem to think it has
something to do with a woman?

04:05.671 --> 04:08.076
You have got to be kidding.
How long have I known you?

04:08.141 --> 04:11.114
Well, I'm just making some
changes in my life, that's all.

04:11.178 --> 04:12.780
I'm giving myself
a little more time.

04:12.847 --> 04:13.949
Who is she?

04:14.015 --> 04:17.254
You may as well tell him. You're
going to sooner or later anyway.

04:17.451 --> 04:19.154
All right, guys, I'll tell you.

04:19.221 --> 04:20.555
But you can't tell Thomas.

04:21.089 --> 04:23.126
Tell me what?
Thomas! What?

04:23.191 --> 04:24.928
You don't want them
to tell me what?

04:24.993 --> 04:27.765
He doesn't want us to tell
you that you're late. Again.

04:27.829 --> 04:29.299
And I've got to go.

04:29.364 --> 04:30.633
This will only take a second,

04:30.700 --> 04:33.237
and you'd hate yourselves if
you didn't hear my proposal.

04:33.302 --> 04:34.371
Proposal?

04:34.437 --> 04:35.839
Yes. For

04:36.406 --> 04:38.944
the Great Hawaiian
Adventure Company.

04:39.977 --> 04:42.147
One minute. That's all
I'm gonna give you.

04:42.379 --> 04:44.149
That's all I need, T.C.

04:44.215 --> 04:46.619
And believe me, you
will not regret this.

04:46.685 --> 04:49.189
Gentlemen, this could be

04:49.254 --> 04:50.824
the turning point

04:51.022 --> 04:52.392
in our lives.

04:52.824 --> 04:55.262
A venture that will
not only give us all

04:55.327 --> 04:57.432
a little bit
of financial security,

04:57.496 --> 04:58.965
but a new challenge in life.

04:59.031 --> 05:03.407
A reason for getting up in the
morning and starting the new day.

05:03.469 --> 05:07.143
The Great Hawaiian
Adventure Company!

05:08.542 --> 05:09.677
Or "Great Hawaiian
Expeditions."

05:09.743 --> 05:11.446
You know, I'm not sure which
one I really like better,

05:11.511 --> 05:12.614
but that's not
important right now.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.249
We'll figure out
the details later.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.252
At any rate, this company,

05:16.317 --> 05:20.324
founded by us, and run
by us, and owned by us,

05:20.388 --> 05:23.762
will begin to return our financial
as well as time investment

05:23.826 --> 05:25.563
almost immediately.

05:26.763 --> 05:28.933
Wait! No, T.C.! Come on, you
haven't heard my market research.

05:28.999 --> 05:30.736
No. I heard "investment."
That's enough for me.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.068
Well, not... Well, all
right, take this tape.

05:32.136 --> 05:35.108
It explains all the details,
your participation,

05:35.172 --> 05:36.675
and you're gonna
thank me one day.

05:36.741 --> 05:38.678
See you later. I gotta go.
I already have my tape.

05:38.743 --> 05:39.845
Rick...

05:40.111 --> 05:41.113
Demographics.

05:44.816 --> 05:47.688
Demographics are a
largely misunderstood

05:47.753 --> 05:51.293
and underused tool
in today's marketplace.

05:51.623 --> 05:53.360
Yes, I see.

05:53.526 --> 05:57.467
For instance, nearly
89O_ of all tourists

05:57.530 --> 05:59.868
come to Hawaii
fully expecting the...

06:01.535 --> 06:03.772
Higgins, you forgot your tape!

06:08.475 --> 06:09.945
Demographics.

06:10.445 --> 06:13.016
Demographics are
a largely misunderstood

06:13.081 --> 06:15.921
and underused tool
in today's marketplace.

06:23.326 --> 06:24.796
Demographics.

06:26.029 --> 06:27.565
I know what you're thinking.

06:27.764 --> 06:29.934
But this time, you're wrong.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.737
I wasn't looking to get a iob,

06:31.803 --> 06:33.205
or find a new life direction,

06:33.271 --> 06:34.707
or anything like that.

06:34.772 --> 06:38.679
But great ideas only come along
once or twice in a lifetime.

06:38.944 --> 06:42.116
And this one was definitely
worth pursuing.

06:45.617 --> 06:47.220
"Adventures in Paradise"?

06:47.287 --> 06:49.324
No. Ooh! That's too cute.

06:55.262 --> 06:56.530
Hi. Can I help you?

06:56.596 --> 06:59.401
I have an appointment with Sarah Amlin.
Thomas Magnum.

06:59.467 --> 07:02.773
Thomas Magnum.
Okay, right this way.

07:04.538 --> 07:06.375
What about
the employee pension fund?

07:06.675 --> 07:08.478
Right, right.

07:09.711 --> 07:10.712
What?

07:10.779 --> 07:13.117
Miss Amlin, it's your
OO appointment.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.618
OO already?

07:14.684 --> 07:16.354
Yes, I'm here. She'll
be right with you.

07:16.420 --> 07:17.822
Thank you. Sorry.

07:17.887 --> 07:21.094
No, that's not the percentage
we talked about. No. Mmm-mmm.

07:21.959 --> 07:23.662
Uh, just sit anywhere.

07:24.128 --> 07:25.163
Oh.

07:25.963 --> 07:29.738
I'm sorry, Doug. No. No, those
figures, they just don't work for me.

07:29.801 --> 07:30.969
Okay.

07:31.069 --> 07:32.070
Call me back.

07:32.370 --> 07:33.673
Yes, I'll be here.

07:34.906 --> 07:36.009
Sounds like trouble.

07:36.708 --> 07:39.815
Well, these things have a way
of working themselves out.

07:39.879 --> 07:42.551
It's been my experience
that most big corporations

07:42.615 --> 07:45.253
have their own little
intricate set of troubles.

07:45.318 --> 07:47.522
It's not the airlines.
It's my divorce.

07:48.789 --> 07:51.261
Oh! Well, there's nothing
like a little work

07:51.325 --> 07:53.262
to help you
forget your problems.

07:53.327 --> 07:54.997
Yeah, I guess so.

07:55.495 --> 08:00.072
So, you said on the phone you
have a proposition for Paradise?

08:00.135 --> 08:02.205
Yes. The Great Hawaiian...

08:04.540 --> 08:06.175
The Great Hawaiian
Adventure Company.

08:06.242 --> 08:08.512
It's a specialized tour package.

08:08.577 --> 08:10.681
We bring the people
to Hawaii on your airline,

08:10.747 --> 08:12.382
at a discounted rate, of course

08:12.448 --> 08:16.824
and then, take them on their
fantasy tour of paradise.

08:19.256 --> 08:20.324
Freddy!

08:20.391 --> 08:21.861
What? I beg your pardon?

08:23.160 --> 08:24.796
My husband, Fred.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.235
He had a different get-rich-quick
scheme for every day of the week.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.169
Oh, this isn't...

08:30.235 --> 08:34.243
"The really great ideas only come along
once or twice in a lifetime," he'd say.

08:34.307 --> 08:36.077
Well, there's
some truth to that.

08:36.142 --> 08:37.445
Meanwhile, we threw money away

08:37.510 --> 08:40.616
on every impossible dream, one
after the other, and I just...

08:40.679 --> 08:42.150
I just finally got sick
of supporting him.

08:42.216 --> 08:44.053
Do you know what I mean?

08:44.116 --> 08:46.922
Yeah. But this is not
an impossible dream.

08:46.987 --> 08:49.359
I have the manpower,
the concept is solid,

08:49.424 --> 08:52.363
and I think the demographics
and the market research.

08:52.427 --> 08:55.267
Is something
you'll find very interesting.

08:56.598 --> 08:57.766
Your lawyer on line two.

08:59.301 --> 09:00.671
Excuse me.

09:03.138 --> 09:05.008
Hold one minute, Doug.

09:05.641 --> 09:06.977
Look, Mr. Magnum.

09:07.043 --> 09:08.044
Thomas.

09:08.678 --> 09:12.151
Thomas, I'm not sure what Paradise
would get out of your proposition.

09:14.018 --> 09:17.658
Well, I've outlined
everything in detail

09:18.723 --> 09:20.125
in this report
that I've drawn up.

09:20.192 --> 09:21.928
Well the thing is, I'm very
busy right now, and...

09:21.994 --> 09:24.198
Yes, but if you'll
just read the report.

09:24.263 --> 09:26.000
You won't be sorry.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.805
Well, if you wanna stop back by

09:30.869 --> 09:33.507
after the rest of the business
world goes to dinner...

09:33.574 --> 09:35.043
I'll be here.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.277
OO?

09:36.343 --> 09:37.578
On the nose.

09:38.878 --> 09:39.880
Thank you.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.952
Okay, Doug, I'm back.

09:44.018 --> 09:46.924
No, the house is mine!
We agreed to that.

09:48.790 --> 09:51.662
I don't care what I signed!
Can't you explain it away?

09:51.726 --> 09:53.996
Duress or something? Fraud?

10:12.884 --> 10:15.589
Well, how'd it go today?

10:16.020 --> 10:17.390
All right.

10:17.989 --> 10:19.927
You got any good tapes?

10:20.592 --> 10:22.495
Yeah, maybe one or two.

10:25.731 --> 10:27.868
You know, I was just thinking,

10:27.934 --> 10:29.603
maybe that iob you got
at the hospital,

10:29.668 --> 10:31.204
it might do a lot
of good for you.

10:31.271 --> 10:33.643
Hi, T.C.!
Welcome to "Paradise found!"

10:33.707 --> 10:35.143
What's this?

10:35.343 --> 10:36.946
Your job, should you...

10:37.945 --> 10:40.850
Just some project that Magnum
wanted to talk to me about.

10:40.915 --> 10:42.318
You know, I think
that's one of the reasons

10:42.384 --> 10:44.922
why you got in trouble
at your mom's.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.725
Too much time after school
with nothing to do.

10:48.156 --> 10:50.828
I made a mistake, okay?
I'm paying for it, aren't I?

10:50.892 --> 10:52.128
That's not what I'm saying.
What I'm saying

10:52.195 --> 10:54.132
is that you're
staying with me now,

10:54.197 --> 10:56.569
things are gonna be done
a little bit differently.

10:56.633 --> 11:00.107
You know, I think that this community
service thing that the judge gave you,

11:00.170 --> 11:02.808
well, maybe it ought to be
something that you should pursue.

11:02.873 --> 11:05.445
I guess. The only thing is,

11:05.510 --> 11:08.315
I don't want to spend all
my spare time over there.

11:08.380 --> 11:11.285
I thought when I came here,
we'd have some time together.

11:11.349 --> 11:13.721
To do stuff.
You know, you and me.

11:17.223 --> 11:20.530
Well, I mean, you know we're
gonna do lots of that.

12:11.016 --> 12:13.054
I didn't invite them here.

13:21.111 --> 13:23.516
The point is,
Higgins, no one on the island

13:23.581 --> 13:25.918
has a sense of history
that can match yours.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.855
Your sense of
dramatic flair, your...

13:28.920 --> 13:30.823
Well, you get my drift. Anyway,

13:30.888 --> 13:33.093
we pick the tourists up
at the airport,

13:33.158 --> 13:36.631
whisk them out to the estate for
a brief historical perspective,

13:36.695 --> 13:38.932
courtesy of
Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

13:38.997 --> 13:40.700
This is absolute balderdash.

13:40.766 --> 13:43.371
And then, after a tour
of the grounds...

13:46.005 --> 13:49.645
"The persona is too obiective,
lacks emotional involvement."

13:50.110 --> 13:51.545
Of course it lacks
emotional involvement!

13:51.612 --> 13:53.182
That's precisely how I wrote it.

13:53.914 --> 13:55.517
How could a British
army officer function

13:55.583 --> 13:57.553
if he were forever
getting emotionally involved?

13:57.619 --> 13:59.022
It's absurd.

13:59.621 --> 14:02.828
What kind of cretins are they
hiring as editors these days?

14:04.759 --> 14:07.064
Naturally, I'd like to be
published. Who wouldn't?

14:09.231 --> 14:12.236
But at the expense
of destroying the material?

14:37.896 --> 14:40.501
We will be picked
up by T.C♪ s helicopter

14:40.567 --> 14:42.404
for an aerial orientation.

14:42.469 --> 14:43.672
Now, that gives you a chance

14:43.737 --> 14:46.242
to get everything back in
order for the second group.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.243
Now, I know at first,

14:48.309 --> 14:50.881
there probably won't be any
more than one group a day.

14:50.945 --> 14:52.113
However...

14:57.285 --> 14:59.422
"imagine you're sitting at home
in White Bear Lake, Minnesota."

14:59.488 --> 15:01.058
"it's freezing outside."

15:01.123 --> 15:02.926
Mr. Magnum? In here!

15:08.197 --> 15:09.366
Hello.

15:10.534 --> 15:13.539
Well, I was never any
good at apologies, so

15:14.038 --> 15:15.140
I hope you'll accept this dinner

15:15.205 --> 15:19.881
as my way of saying, "I'm sorry for
being such a jerk earlier today."

15:19.943 --> 15:21.079
Oh!

15:21.212 --> 15:22.882
Well, you weren't a jerk.

15:22.947 --> 15:24.717
No, we had an appointment.

15:24.783 --> 15:26.953
I let my personal life
get in the way of business.

15:27.018 --> 15:29.858
So now I'm letting business get
in the way of my personal life.

15:30.956 --> 15:32.726
I don't mean that
having dinner with you

15:32.792 --> 15:35.364
would in any way interfere
with my personal life.

15:37.998 --> 15:38.999
Could we start over?

15:39.066 --> 15:40.401
Of course.

15:41.368 --> 15:43.372
The report was very interesting.

15:44.805 --> 15:46.208
You read it?

15:47.942 --> 15:50.179
Dinner will be ready
in seven minutes.

15:50.345 --> 15:52.148
Champagne? Uh, great.

15:53.449 --> 15:54.551
Ah!

15:58.253 --> 16:00.324
Oh, my God! Are you all right?

16:00.390 --> 16:02.327
No, I'm fine. I'm fine, really.

16:02.392 --> 16:03.962
Maybe, uh, No, I'm just...

16:04.027 --> 16:05.830
you'd like to come back tomorrow?
I'm fine! Really.

16:05.895 --> 16:09.836
No, I think it's better that I
make my presentation tonight.

16:10.101 --> 16:12.271
Who knows what
tomorrow will bring?

16:12.336 --> 16:14.239
Right. Good. Okay.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.445
So I'll just...
Yeah, yeah. Just...

16:18.276 --> 16:19.277
Go right ahead.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.352
Imagine you're sitting at home

16:24.417 --> 16:26.454
in White Bear Lake, Minnesota.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.623
It's freezing outside.

16:28.689 --> 16:31.561
The temperature is five
degrees below zero

16:31.625 --> 16:33.895
with a wind chill
factor of minus 20.

16:33.961 --> 16:37.400
You are whisked away from the
ice and snow via Paradise Airlines

16:37.464 --> 16:40.871
to the sun-kissed shores of
the beautiful island of Oahu,

16:40.934 --> 16:43.539
the most famous
of all the Hawaiian Islands.

16:44.472 --> 16:46.844
What's that?
That was a mistake.

16:46.908 --> 16:48.244
I meant to turn on some music.

16:48.310 --> 16:50.580
Hey,
Cleo, can I help you with anything?

16:50.646 --> 16:52.049
Yeah, pour the champagne.

16:52.114 --> 16:53.249
Okay.

16:54.818 --> 16:56.988
You look beautiful.

16:57.052 --> 16:59.357
Thanks. I thought
I heard Thomas's voice.

16:59.689 --> 17:02.629
Yeah, you did. It was on a tape.

17:02.693 --> 17:05.064
Oh! You're working
on a case together!

17:05.128 --> 17:06.865
That sounds very exciting.

17:06.931 --> 17:10.103
No. He's got some scheme
he wants me to invest in.

17:11.369 --> 17:13.406
That guy is so smart.

17:14.339 --> 17:17.144
Did I ever tell you about the time
he came to me for some information

17:17.209 --> 17:19.346
about this guy that's on
the board of regents?

17:19.412 --> 17:21.147
Yes, Cleo. Oh, God.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.852
We stayed up all night staking
this guy's house out.

17:23.916 --> 17:26.789
I have never had so much
fun in my whole life.

17:26.854 --> 17:29.226
Yeah. Thomas is a real card,
that's for sure.

17:29.790 --> 17:30.925
You know, you sure are lucky

17:30.991 --> 17:33.595
to have a guy like that
for a best friend.

17:33.662 --> 17:35.398
Yeah, right. And you
know something?

17:35.463 --> 17:38.000
He doesn't even seem to mind
about what I do for a living.

17:38.065 --> 17:40.203
You know, being a
working girl and all.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.570
Oops! Crepes are ready.

17:41.636 --> 17:42.972
I'll be right back.

17:44.239 --> 17:45.442
Cleo,

17:47.043 --> 17:49.414
did you and Thomas ever...

17:50.379 --> 17:51.515
What?

17:51.981 --> 17:53.183
Well...

17:53.483 --> 17:55.553
Did you and Thomas ever...

17:56.153 --> 17:58.725
Forget it. It's nothing.

17:59.356 --> 18:02.696
I just want you to know how much I've
enjoyed the last few weeks with you.

18:03.494 --> 18:05.097
Oh, I have too.

18:05.163 --> 18:06.164
Really?

18:06.231 --> 18:07.701
You're comfortable.

18:07.866 --> 18:10.103
Like being around my brother.

18:13.105 --> 18:14.675
Cleo. Hmm.

18:16.008 --> 18:18.346
What do you say we go
dancing after dinner?

18:19.112 --> 18:20.581
You hate dancing!

18:20.647 --> 18:22.484
Yeah. But hey, a guy can change.

18:24.050 --> 18:25.152
Okay.

18:33.495 --> 18:35.365
Hi, Rick, it's me.

18:35.430 --> 18:37.835
So here's the part
where you come in.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.570
You'll pick the group up
at the estate

18:39.636 --> 18:42.675
and fly them to a remote area
of the Koolaus,

18:42.739 --> 18:44.509
where I will join them

18:44.574 --> 18:48.783
and take them on a three-day,
two-night adventure in the backwoods.

18:49.178 --> 18:51.048
Oh you will, will you?

18:52.149 --> 18:54.052
Well? What do you think?

18:54.118 --> 18:56.490
Good investment or wild scheme?

18:57.622 --> 18:59.759
I don't know. Good, I guess.

19:01.226 --> 19:02.762
You're not eating, man.

19:02.828 --> 19:04.297
I'm not really that hungry.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.938
Bryant, you did the
right thing last week.

19:10.002 --> 19:12.907
I mean, telling the police who
really stole the motorcycle.

19:12.973 --> 19:14.376
They think I'm a snitch.

19:14.441 --> 19:16.211
Yeah, but we don't care
what they think.

19:19.246 --> 19:20.849
Look, I know how you feel. I...

19:20.915 --> 19:22.250
Can I be excused?

19:22.717 --> 19:25.089
Bryant, I'm talking to you.

19:33.462 --> 19:35.499
There are gonna have to be
some changes here.

19:35.564 --> 19:37.301
I don't know what you're
used to in L.A.

19:37.366 --> 19:38.836
but you're here now,

19:38.902 --> 19:42.276
and you're gonna have to
start learning discipline,

19:43.073 --> 19:46.713
responsibility,
and common manners.

19:53.852 --> 19:55.956
Go on, go to your room.
We'll talk about this later.

20:09.302 --> 20:11.039
Don't bother
thanking me, T.C.

20:11.104 --> 20:15.079
I'm happy to include my good friends
in on an idea that can't miss.

20:23.151 --> 20:24.319
I think you're right.

20:24.386 --> 20:26.189
You do? Mmm-hmm.

20:26.254 --> 20:29.728
It has good promotional possibilities
for Paradise Airlines.

20:29.792 --> 20:32.464
You get your discount tickets and
we reach a whole new market.

20:32.528 --> 20:33.864
What can I say?

20:33.930 --> 20:35.132
"Yes" would be good.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.072
Well, unfortunately, I'm not
the one who can say "yes."

20:39.136 --> 20:40.671
That's up to
the board of directors.

20:41.672 --> 20:45.212
Of course, I'll give them my
enthusiastic recommendation.

20:46.210 --> 20:48.213
This is turning out
better than I thought.

20:49.948 --> 20:52.285
I mean, you know...

20:53.018 --> 20:54.287
I know what you mean.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.023
Yeah.

20:56.355 --> 20:59.160
The board is meeting OO.

20:59.224 --> 21:02.164
I'll put you on the
agenda on one condition.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.531
What?

21:05.733 --> 21:07.736
Leave your easel at home.

21:10.604 --> 21:12.140
That's a deal.

21:20.950 --> 21:23.187
Once they make you the
officer of a corporation,

21:23.251 --> 21:25.221
your life is never your own.

21:30.159 --> 21:31.595
Sarah Amlin.

21:33.897 --> 21:35.867
I told you not to call me again.

21:35.933 --> 21:38.806
No. I told you
to talk to my lawyers.

21:40.705 --> 21:42.208
Just a minute.

21:42.307 --> 21:44.210
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:45.610 --> 21:48.415
I really do think
they're gonna go for it.

21:51.083 --> 21:52.286
Great.

21:54.054 --> 21:55.156
Bye.

21:57.090 --> 21:58.192
Bye.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.495
It's no good, Fred.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.132
We've been over this
a hundred times.

22:04.999 --> 22:06.535
What can I say?

22:20.449 --> 22:21.652
Bryant.

22:24.121 --> 22:27.227
Bryant, why do you kids have
to play the radio so loud...

22:54.621 --> 22:56.358
Thanks for the ride.
Hey, take it easy.

23:24.538 --> 23:27.811
After three days and
two nights in the wilderness,

23:27.875 --> 23:31.716
our tourist groups are going to
really be ready for a little luxury.

23:32.614 --> 23:34.084
We offer them a hot shower,

23:34.149 --> 23:36.319
and then we hit them
with high tea

23:36.384 --> 23:40.058
and give them a chance to recount their
adventures in the wilderness to you.

23:40.623 --> 23:44.330
And who knows, Higgins? This could
be fodder for another book.

23:44.393 --> 23:47.466
Remembrances of Other People's
Adventures in Paradise.

23:47.531 --> 23:50.036
There's really no end
to the possibilities!

23:50.100 --> 23:51.135
For instance, Indeed.

23:51.201 --> 23:52.704
One of the things
I was thinking about...

23:55.440 --> 23:58.846
And I suppose I'd be stuck with
more ridiculous notes from editors

23:58.910 --> 24:00.813
about the "dramatic voice"

24:01.012 --> 24:03.116
of that tome as well.

24:04.949 --> 24:06.018
I see.

24:06.085 --> 24:07.086
No.

24:07.953 --> 24:10.190
Thank you. Look, if you
should hear from him...

24:10.956 --> 24:12.459
Thanks.

24:18.431 --> 24:19.901
Bryant? Mr. Calvin?

24:19.966 --> 24:22.137
Yes? This is William Chun.

24:22.702 --> 24:24.342
I'm afraid Bryant
has been arrested again.

24:24.872 --> 24:26.207
We have him in custody.

24:28.075 --> 24:29.076
I'm on my way.

24:54.104 --> 24:55.307
What happened?

24:55.907 --> 24:58.378
We were taking a joy ride.
No big deal.

24:59.911 --> 25:00.946
No big deal?

25:01.012 --> 25:02.548
Come on. Get me out of here.

25:04.450 --> 25:05.953
I made a mistake, okay?

25:06.018 --> 25:07.387
A mistake?

25:07.453 --> 25:08.823
I won't do it again.

25:08.888 --> 25:11.860
Man, what is wrong with you? You've got
everything in the world going for you.

25:11.924 --> 25:13.762
Do we have to
talk about this here?

25:16.329 --> 25:17.432
Yeah.

25:18.166 --> 25:20.971
Yeah. We do. Maybe this is the one
place you'll have to listen to me.

25:21.035 --> 25:23.673
Oh, man. Bryant, you are not
making little mistakes.

25:23.805 --> 25:25.073
You are screwing up.

25:25.139 --> 25:27.410
You're cutting classes, you're getting
into fights, you're stealing...

25:27.476 --> 25:30.348
Oh, sure, take Mom's side of it.
Don't bother to trust me.

25:31.346 --> 25:32.816
I trusted you tonight.

25:32.881 --> 25:35.119
Are you gonna get me
out of here or not?

25:38.088 --> 25:39.256
No.

25:41.024 --> 25:42.560
No, I'm not.

25:43.260 --> 25:44.362
Dad!

25:44.695 --> 25:46.699
Somewhere along the line, you're
gonna have to start to figure out

25:46.765 --> 25:49.604
that when you mess up
you've got to pay the price.

25:49.668 --> 25:52.774
Now, maybe a night in here will give
you a chance to think about that.

25:52.837 --> 25:55.777
That's great. Just walk out.
That's all you ever do.

25:55.874 --> 25:57.343
When do you pay the price?

25:58.143 --> 25:59.279
Right now.

26:36.821 --> 26:38.824
Rosine, where's Rick?

26:39.856 --> 26:41.326
He's dancing.

26:51.838 --> 26:52.906
Excuse me. Rick?

26:53.806 --> 26:55.276
Cleo! Hi, Thomas!

26:55.575 --> 26:57.111
What are you doing here?

26:57.177 --> 26:59.648
Eh, Thomas, it's not what you think.
She's my guest.

27:01.281 --> 27:03.452
It's been a long time. I know.

27:05.486 --> 27:07.791
Oh, the last time I saw you was...
Behind the, uh...

27:07.856 --> 27:10.428
Right! I'll never
forget that night.

27:10.492 --> 27:11.894
Me, either. You look great.

27:11.959 --> 27:13.195
You do too.

27:13.461 --> 27:15.899
Oh, I heard your tape.
It sounds real interesting.

27:15.964 --> 27:17.533
I might like to get
into that project.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.635
Great!

27:18.701 --> 27:20.738
Yeah, well, we'd like to stand
here and talk to you, Thomas,

27:20.803 --> 27:23.283
but we gotta go. We've got a lot
of things to do. See you later.

27:23.906 --> 27:27.178
Rick! Wait! I wanna talk to you.
About business.

27:27.243 --> 27:29.514
Well, call me at the office.
Hi, T.C. Bye, T.C.

27:29.580 --> 27:31.016
Bye, Thomas! Bye, Cleo!

27:31.081 --> 27:32.951
T.C., can I get you something?

27:33.016 --> 27:35.955
Oh! Yeah, Rosine. How
about a cup of coffee?

27:36.019 --> 27:37.856
Longneck, Thomas? Why not?

27:37.921 --> 27:40.259
I'm glad you're here, T.C. Did you
get a chance to listen to the tape?

27:40.325 --> 27:41.828
Uh, yeah...
Because I think I got

27:41.894 --> 27:43.797
the discounted airline
tickets in the bag.

27:43.862 --> 27:46.500
And that should substantially
raise our profit index.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.969
Good.

27:49.034 --> 27:51.204
Boy! Between you and Rick,

27:51.270 --> 27:53.608
I'm not sure I can
handle the enthusiasm.

27:54.241 --> 27:55.409
Thanks.

27:57.244 --> 27:59.114
You know, you wanna learn
to fly the helicopter,

27:59.179 --> 28:03.221
you read some books, you take some
classes, you make a few mistakes,

28:03.284 --> 28:06.256
you pick yourself up and you try again.
Before you know it,

28:07.856 --> 28:08.924
you flying.

28:09.791 --> 28:11.127
You don't worry about

28:11.193 --> 28:14.867
whether you're gonna be the best
helicopter pilot in the world, or,

28:14.931 --> 28:16.968
"Are you going to inadvertently
do something wrong"

28:17.032 --> 28:18.702
"and ruin the helicopter
for life?"

28:18.768 --> 28:20.973
Now who's talking around
what they wanna say?

28:22.706 --> 28:25.278
You have a natural
talent for flying, T.C.

28:25.342 --> 28:26.410
Yeah.

28:27.411 --> 28:30.083
Yeah well, you also have
a natural talent with kids.

28:31.650 --> 28:33.320
So I guess the trick is to just

28:34.552 --> 28:39.061
know when to put down
the book and just fly,

28:39.124 --> 28:40.392
on gut instinct.

28:41.727 --> 28:43.130
That's what I tell my kids

28:43.996 --> 28:45.164
when I'm coaching them.

28:45.631 --> 28:47.368
I think that's where I heard it.

28:49.135 --> 28:51.306
Okay! About the tape.

28:51.538 --> 28:54.243
What do you think about
"Rainbow Excursions"?

28:54.374 --> 28:57.246
Sorry, Thomas. I've got something
I got to take care of.

28:57.311 --> 28:59.215
Oh, Rosine, can I have
my check, please? Sure.

28:59.747 --> 29:01.117
I'll put it on my tab.

29:02.250 --> 29:03.653
Yeah.

29:05.621 --> 29:07.123
Your tab for tonight,

29:08.022 --> 29:09.291
and, uh,

29:10.125 --> 29:11.828
these will bring you up to date.

29:18.301 --> 29:21.306
What do you think
of "Paradise Found"?

29:21.439 --> 29:22.541
For what?

29:23.474 --> 29:26.914
Imagine you're sitting at home
in White Bear Lake, Minnesota.

29:26.978 --> 29:29.850
It's freezing outside.

29:29.915 --> 29:33.722
The temperature is five degrees below zero
with a wind chill factor of minus 20...

29:34.119 --> 29:38.928
As a final memento, I thought
we could give them a photo diary.

29:39.726 --> 29:41.729
Photos I could take,
Higgins, with your...

29:41.794 --> 29:43.932
I mean, Robin's camera.

29:44.197 --> 29:47.704
So! That's about it,
let me know what you think.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.149
Extraordinary.

30:31.450 --> 30:33.487
Maybe you're not
such a wimp after all.

30:34.319 --> 30:37.325
You did okay tonight,
with the cops.

30:37.390 --> 30:39.828
You stood up
to your old man, too.

30:40.995 --> 30:43.467
Maybe we'd consider
jumping you in,

30:43.697 --> 30:45.500
if you wanna belong.

30:49.938 --> 30:52.877
Of course, you'd have to
do something for us first.

30:55.143 --> 30:56.411
Like what?

30:56.478 --> 30:58.315
J Like boost a car on your own.

31:02.251 --> 31:03.720
Unless you can't hack it.

31:06.023 --> 31:07.726
Well, what would you do with it?

31:07.791 --> 31:10.696
What we always do.
Break it down for parts.

31:10.761 --> 31:13.566
Bryant Calvin? Your father's
here to pick you up.

31:16.835 --> 31:18.471
We'll be looking for you.

31:46.651 --> 31:48.588
Imagine you're sitting at home

31:48.653 --> 31:50.156
in White Bear Lake, Minnesota.

31:50.221 --> 31:52.358
It's freezing outside.

31:52.691 --> 31:55.128
The temperature is
five degrees below zero

31:55.194 --> 31:57.231
with a wind chill
factor of minus 20.

32:18.353 --> 32:19.621
Thanks, anyway, Higgins.

32:20.088 --> 32:25.733
What waits for you is balmy
breezes, warm tropical waters,

32:26.128 --> 32:29.568
blue skies, a dream come true.

32:35.773 --> 32:37.041
Oh, that's good, Son.

32:38.843 --> 32:41.113
Nothing like a little elbow
grease to get her shined up, huh?

32:41.178 --> 32:42.179
Yeah.

32:42.614 --> 32:45.252
Boy, you sure got a lot of
stuff stored on the dock.

32:45.317 --> 32:47.487
A couple of trips
ought to take care of it.

32:47.552 --> 32:49.556
What is it?
Mostly food and stuff?

32:49.622 --> 32:50.824
Oh, no.

32:50.889 --> 32:53.127
Auto parts, appliances,
other merchandise.

32:53.192 --> 32:55.529
I'm taking it
to the Outer Islands.

32:55.728 --> 32:59.403
Hey! What's this sudden
interest in the business?

32:59.466 --> 33:01.903
I don't know. Maybe I'll start
my own charter company.

33:01.968 --> 33:02.970
Compete with you.

33:03.036 --> 33:04.171
Whoa!

33:05.305 --> 33:07.308
That's probably Thomas
calling to say he's late.

33:07.375 --> 33:08.844
I'll get it.

33:14.916 --> 33:15.984
Leland Hoppers.

33:17.453 --> 33:18.588
Um, Budge?

33:20.055 --> 33:24.062
Yeah. No, I haven't
actually been able to.

33:25.695 --> 33:26.897
No, I'm going to!

33:33.604 --> 33:35.808
What if I could just
get you the auto parts?

33:36.874 --> 33:37.976
New ones!

33:38.577 --> 33:39.979
No! But... Wait!

33:59.133 --> 34:02.205
Thomas Sullivan Magnum?
Is that you?

34:02.269 --> 34:03.437
Can't be!

34:03.505 --> 34:06.377
I mean, all dressed up,
and on time?

34:06.441 --> 34:08.846
You can laugh all you want, T.C.

34:08.909 --> 34:10.913
When we're millionaires, you'll
be singing a different tune.

34:10.978 --> 34:12.348
How're you doing, Bryant? Okay.

34:12.415 --> 34:14.685
Yeah. Your dad tells me you're
working part-time at a hospital?

34:14.750 --> 34:16.152
Yeah. It's okay, I guess.

34:16.219 --> 34:18.891
Well, I don't want to be
late for my appointment

34:18.955 --> 34:22.594
with the board of directors
of Paradise Airlines at 3:OO,

34:22.659 --> 34:23.893
which is why I came here, T.C.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.295
I'm not going to any
meeting with you.

34:25.362 --> 34:26.429
No, I wouldn't ask you to!

34:26.496 --> 34:27.531
I wouldn't ask you to at all.

34:27.599 --> 34:30.070
I just need to go over my
sales pitch one more time.

34:30.132 --> 34:31.202
You know, make sure
it's perfect.

34:31.268 --> 34:33.206
You don't mind if I steal your dad
away for a couple of minutes,

34:33.271 --> 34:34.674
do you, Bryant? No.

34:35.406 --> 34:36.742
T.C.?

34:37.308 --> 34:41.951
Imagine you're sitting at home
in White Bear Lake, Minnesota.

34:42.014 --> 34:44.652
It's freezing... How do I let
myself get into these things?

36:13.550 --> 36:15.688
That's it?
That's the whole pitch?

36:15.753 --> 36:16.988
Yeah. So what do you think?

36:18.155 --> 36:21.695
I think I can understand why you're trying
to make such a drastic change in your life.

36:23.995 --> 36:25.965
It's not a drastic change, T.C.

36:26.698 --> 36:27.867
Yes, it is.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.038
But whatever I can do
to help, I'll be glad to do.

36:32.372 --> 36:34.776
So, how are things
here with Bryant?

36:35.375 --> 36:38.582
I don't know. We're still
in flight school together.

36:41.048 --> 36:42.618
I think we're making headway.

36:54.563 --> 36:55.731
Bryant?

36:56.332 --> 36:58.469
I don't think so.
Zodiac's missing.

37:09.747 --> 37:11.750
He can't handle that boat
in this water.

37:11.816 --> 37:12.984
Not by himself.

37:18.857 --> 37:21.094
He won't go far,
the tank's almost empty.

38:04.308 --> 38:06.412
Oh, looks like
the engine stalled.

38:06.477 --> 38:09.517
Without an engine the wind's gonna
wash him right up on the rocks.

38:09.581 --> 38:11.501
Another gust of wind and
we'll go into the cliFFs.

38:14.652 --> 38:16.857
You can drop me.
I'll bring the boat in.

38:16.922 --> 38:18.090
No. Too risky.

38:19.758 --> 38:21.929
If we get too low, the rotor
blades will chop up the sea

38:21.995 --> 38:23.665
and turn him over.

38:25.565 --> 38:26.667
Damn it! He's over!

38:50.359 --> 38:51.361
Help!

39:05.911 --> 39:07.347
I'm gonna get you out of here.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.617
Bryant, I need you
to hold on to me. Okay?

39:10.682 --> 39:11.751
Okay.

39:38.614 --> 39:40.484
Come on. Come on!

40:20.694 --> 40:22.197
They wanted me to steal a car

40:22.363 --> 40:24.433
so I could belong to their gang.

40:24.498 --> 40:25.666
But I didn't do it.

40:26.001 --> 40:27.838
You don't know what it's like
not to fit in.

40:28.436 --> 40:29.538
To be scared.

40:30.705 --> 40:32.575
So you run off
and risk your own life

40:32.641 --> 40:34.378
to join some motorcycle gang.

40:35.811 --> 40:37.414
I knew you wouldn't understand.

40:37.480 --> 40:40.619
Hey, you wait a minute. Don't you
talk to me about not understanding.

40:40.683 --> 40:43.321
You think I don't know how it
feels to be lonely and scared?

40:43.386 --> 40:45.457
I've been to those places
lots of times.

40:46.156 --> 40:47.559
But it's what you do when
you're feeling that way

40:47.624 --> 40:48.792
that says something about you.

40:48.860 --> 40:50.229
Yeah, but... You wanna belong?

40:50.360 --> 40:52.163
You already belong.
You belong to your family.

40:52.230 --> 40:54.368
To me, your mother, your sister.

40:54.432 --> 40:56.335
Did you even stop to think
what it would've meant to them

40:56.401 --> 40:58.204
if something
had happened to you?

40:58.270 --> 41:00.310
You always want people to
accept you and take you in,

41:00.339 --> 41:02.744
but you don't want to have any
responsibility toward them.

41:02.808 --> 41:05.049
Now, I got a gang of kids playing
baseball every Saturday.

41:05.078 --> 41:06.246
You can join them.

41:06.312 --> 41:08.650
Or I'll tell you what. You
stated your case pretty good,

41:08.715 --> 41:12.089
so why don't you hang out with the
guys on the debating team at school?

41:12.153 --> 41:13.990
If you wanna ruin your life

41:14.055 --> 41:16.960
by trying to belong to some
tired motorcycle gang,

41:17.024 --> 41:18.560
well, that's up to you.

41:19.660 --> 41:21.630
But don't expect me
to feel bad for you.

41:23.932 --> 41:25.602
I almost lost my son today.

41:28.271 --> 41:29.606
You gonna send me home?

41:31.040 --> 41:32.576
I don't know.

41:32.975 --> 41:34.311
I'd like to stay.

41:45.957 --> 41:47.326
Eat the chicken soup.

41:47.558 --> 41:49.128
It's supposed to be
good for you.

41:59.805 --> 42:02.010
Yeah, sure. I understand, Sarah.

42:02.608 --> 42:03.609
Of course.

42:03.777 --> 42:06.415
He had the exact
same idea I had, huh?

42:07.281 --> 42:08.883
Yeah!

42:09.015 --> 42:10.251
It is a coincidence.

42:10.650 --> 42:11.886
Yeah...

42:12.186 --> 42:13.756
Yep. You too.

42:15.790 --> 42:16.990
Missed your meeting, huh?

42:18.360 --> 42:21.299
Well, it's no big deal. You know the
woman I talked to about the tickets?

42:21.363 --> 42:23.735
Her ex-husband, Fred,
had the same idea.

42:23.799 --> 42:25.602
And they've decided
to go with him.

42:25.734 --> 42:26.735
Now what?

42:26.870 --> 42:30.777
Well in th'e words of my
great-grandfather, Patrick,

42:30.840 --> 42:32.310
"Regroup," T.C.

42:32.409 --> 42:35.281
"Don't let the first setback
set you back."

42:35.346 --> 42:37.617
Onward and upward.
I'm calling another meeting.

42:43.621 --> 42:45.091
Hi, Loni. Hi, Thomas.

42:45.157 --> 42:46.994
Hey Thomas, T.C♪ s
not gonna make it.

42:47.058 --> 42:49.028
He went fishing with Bryant.

42:49.094 --> 42:50.197
But I gotta talk to you.

42:50.263 --> 42:53.223
Well that's why I came here, to go over
all this stuff with you and Higgins.

42:53.266 --> 42:54.434
Where's Higgins?

42:54.500 --> 42:56.570
Never mind Higgins, and
never mind all that stuff.

42:56.636 --> 42:58.306
Sit down here. I got
something to say.

42:58.472 --> 42:59.473
Oh!

43:02.142 --> 43:04.981
Look, here's the deal.
It's sort of hypothetical,

43:05.045 --> 43:07.250
but let's say that you were me.

43:07.781 --> 43:10.319
Strike that. Let's
say that I were me,

43:10.385 --> 43:11.421
which of course I am.

43:11.487 --> 43:14.392
I mean, the point is, it shouldn't
matter what someone has done,

43:14.456 --> 43:15.959
or hasn't done, or with whom,

43:16.058 --> 43:17.427
or even if you know who.

43:18.394 --> 43:21.601
I mean, as far as I'm
concerned, it never happened.

43:21.664 --> 43:24.469
I'm sure that it probably
really didn't ever happen.

43:24.533 --> 43:27.806
But if it did, I don't wanna know.
Okay?

43:29.039 --> 43:30.040
Okay.

43:30.474 --> 43:31.843
And I'd appreciate it

43:32.076 --> 43:33.712
if you'd never
bring it up again.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.981
You can count on it.

43:36.047 --> 43:37.550
I'm glad we got that settled.

43:38.483 --> 43:41.155
I'm late. I gotta go. I
gotta go to a dance class.

43:41.220 --> 43:42.589
Dance class? Yeah.

43:42.654 --> 43:44.356
Cleo and I signed up
for Arthur Murray.

43:44.424 --> 43:45.793
Cleo?

43:46.326 --> 43:48.029
See you later, Thomas. Rick!

43:49.963 --> 43:50.964
Cleo?

43:53.132 --> 43:55.770
Higgins! Well, I knew you
wouldn't disappoint me.

43:55.835 --> 43:57.205
Indeed not.

43:57.271 --> 44:00.478
The only ones who are going to be
disappointed are your publishers.

44:00.542 --> 44:01.644
My publishers?

44:01.709 --> 44:04.949
Well, you are the one who sent them
my memoirs in the first place.

44:05.113 --> 44:08.419
Unfortunately, Magnum, I've
discovered an entirely new tack

44:08.484 --> 44:09.986
to take on the book.

44:10.051 --> 44:12.156
A more emotionally
involved direction.

44:12.221 --> 44:13.623
It's quite exciting.

44:13.688 --> 44:15.124
I'm going to rewrite
the whole thing

44:15.191 --> 44:16.460
and put it up for a bidding war.

44:16.526 --> 44:17.527
That's great!

44:17.627 --> 44:20.967
I wanted to tell you before I sent
their check back out of courtesy.

44:21.365 --> 44:23.335
Well, thank you. I guess we
can get down to business now.

44:23.400 --> 44:26.540
I'm afraid not. I must get back, Magnum.
There's months of work ahead

44:26.603 --> 44:27.905
but it will be worth it.

44:27.971 --> 44:31.078
I sense that this new approach will bring
every publishing house in the world

44:31.142 --> 44:32.545
to its knees.

44:33.211 --> 44:34.647
That's great.

44:34.712 --> 44:35.880
Goodbye, Magnum.
