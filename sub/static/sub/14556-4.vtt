WEBVTT

00:09.143 --> 00:11.445
( birds chirping )

00:14.782 --> 00:18.219
In 20 years of teaching,

00:18.252 --> 00:21.255
I've never received
evaluation comments like these.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.590
"Boring." Me?

00:22.623 --> 00:24.392
"Intellectually... inaccessible"

00:24.425 --> 00:26.560
I thought we came
up on this hike

00:26.594 --> 00:29.630
to get your mind off of
this ridiculous thing.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.465
I mean, one student even said

00:31.499 --> 00:34.068
I'm out of touch with
cutting-edge thinking

00:34.102 --> 00:35.403
in multidimensional theory.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.406
That one alone
kept me up at night.

00:38.439 --> 00:42.176
Everybody gets bad evaluations
now and then. Come on!

00:42.210 --> 00:43.411
Yeah, yeah, says the professor

00:43.444 --> 00:45.179
who never received
anything less than a rave.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.381
As with any large group,
there are responses

00:47.415 --> 00:48.682
that cover
the entire spectrum.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.784
I once had a girl in
my combinatronics seminar

00:50.818 --> 00:53.521
tell me that I was disorganized
and I talked too fast.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.489
That's an accurate
observation, actually.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.592
But, generally speaking,
I mean, your students love you,

00:58.626 --> 01:01.362
whereas mine say my classes
put them to sleep.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.596
You're an exceptional professor.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.465
I should know,
I took classes from you.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.500
But you were an
exceptional young mind.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.536
Perhaps I've lost
my ability to reach

01:08.569 --> 01:09.603
the more typical student.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.139
Hey, Professor Fleinhardt.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.840
Hey, how's it... How's it...

01:12.873 --> 01:14.542
How's it...
How-how you...

01:14.575 --> 01:15.543
How you... How you...

01:15.576 --> 01:17.178
See, we're not even in class,

01:17.211 --> 01:19.113
and still my students
run away from me.

01:19.147 --> 01:21.515
I don't think that's it.

01:21.549 --> 01:26.354
( distant siren wailing )

01:26.387 --> 01:27.855
CHARLIE:
Right...

01:27.888 --> 01:29.523
They're right down this way.
Come on.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.659
Hurry, man.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.461
( officer speaking indistinctly)

01:42.803 --> 01:43.871
So who do we have here?

01:43.904 --> 01:46.207
Finn Montgomery.
Male, white, 21.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.608
CalSci student I.D.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.243
CHARLIE: No way! It is Finn
Montgomery!

01:49.277 --> 01:50.511
He jumped.

01:50.544 --> 01:54.348
Professor, my name
is Finn Montgomery. Uh...

01:54.382 --> 01:56.484
How could this
have happened?

01:56.517 --> 01:58.286
Sadly, it happens all the time.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.287
DETECTIVE:
Any witnesses?

01:59.320 --> 02:00.788
OFFICER:
Not for the launch.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.290
A couple
after the landing.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.857
Textbook header,
probable suicide.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.427
This is terrible.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.931
I-I can really use your advice
on some calculations

02:10.964 --> 02:12.666
in my engineering thesis.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.874
Well, he could have stepped off
the bridge instead of jumping.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.177
Yeah, but there
are other factors.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.179
You know, while gravity
pulled him down,

02:25.213 --> 02:27.581
the wind would have pushed him
away from the bridge.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.450
Well, look, there's not
a lot of wind around here.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.718
How much effect would that have?

02:30.751 --> 02:32.386
Finn was wearing a windbreaker.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.387
It's nonpermeable.

02:33.421 --> 02:34.688
It offers an increased surface

02:34.722 --> 02:36.224
area for the wind to act upon,

02:36.257 --> 02:37.458
especially if he was moving.

02:37.491 --> 02:41.529
But if we look at the point of
impact, that's not what we see.

02:41.562 --> 02:44.332
Wind and gravity are constant,
leaving only the surface area.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.434
Somehow, that was reduced.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.302
What are you saying,
he was unconscious?

02:48.336 --> 02:49.937
Or dead already.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.810
What's the difference between
where he should have landed,

02:56.844 --> 02:58.879
if it was a suicide,
and where he landed?

02:58.912 --> 03:00.614
A foot to 18 inches.

03:00.648 --> 03:01.615
A foot?!

03:01.649 --> 03:03.251
Outside the margin
of error.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.319
Listen, unless there is a
clear and compelling reason,

03:05.353 --> 03:07.988
I can't get the FBI to interfere
in a local investigation

03:08.021 --> 03:09.857
because my brother
has a theory.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.725
- That's not the way it works.
- There are indications

03:11.759 --> 03:13.894
that Finn Montgomery did not
jump off this bridge.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.264
Yeah, and to me,
there's indications

03:16.297 --> 03:18.899
this is not just
about physics.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.402
Please, if you can just
take a quick look, uh...

03:22.570 --> 03:24.572
Look, everything I told you

03:24.605 --> 03:26.840
about the fall still holds up.

03:26.874 --> 03:30.244
But, yeah, Finn Montgomery
was in my office two days ago.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.617
CHARLIE: We all use math every
day... every day...

03:36.650 --> 03:38.452
to predict weather...

03:38.486 --> 03:41.455
to tell time...

03:41.489 --> 03:44.525
to handle money.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.529
Math is more than formulas and
equations.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.765
It's logic.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.335
It's rationality.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.705
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.581
Look, Charlie,
this is the kind

04:07.615 --> 04:08.882
of information
I need up front.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.584
If the kid wasn't
one of your students,

04:10.618 --> 04:12.286
then why did he
come and see you?

04:12.320 --> 04:13.621
CalSci is
a small university.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.289
It's a tight community.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.024
Students often
consult professors

04:17.057 --> 04:18.926
outside of their department.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.396
He never tried to contact
you again-- e-mail or...?

04:22.430 --> 04:25.733
Maybe I was too...
unapproachable, I-I don't know.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.267
Yeah, well, maybe it had
nothing to do with you.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.605
But what if he was trying
to tell me something?

04:33.641 --> 04:36.076
All right, look, I'll
make some phone calls.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.978
But the FBI can't just insert
themselves

04:38.011 --> 04:38.946
in these kind of things.

04:38.979 --> 04:39.813
If the police closed the case,

04:39.847 --> 04:41.315
they might not mind me
looking around.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.783
I understand, and thank you.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.318
I-I really appreciate it.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.319
I mean, I'm not convinced

04:45.353 --> 04:47.321
this is anything more
than what it looks like.

04:51.359 --> 04:54.328
You never mentioned that you
had a Fed for a brother.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.329
A "Fed"?

04:55.363 --> 04:56.129
I didn't think
it'd be much

04:56.163 --> 04:57.531
of a selling point
with you, Eva.

04:57.565 --> 05:00.401
My views on government intrusion

05:00.434 --> 05:02.703
into academia are rather firm.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.973
Oh, yeah? Would that be too firm
to talk about Finn Montgomery?

05:06.006 --> 05:08.676
His suicide
or the Malone scandal?

05:08.709 --> 05:09.543
Scandal?

05:09.577 --> 05:11.379
Yeah, another student,
Brian Malone,

05:11.412 --> 05:12.346
was expelled
two weeks ago

05:12.380 --> 05:14.348
for falsifying data
in a lab result, right?

05:14.382 --> 05:15.849
Finn filed the honor code
violations

05:15.883 --> 05:17.117
that led to Brian's expulsion.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.953
Did they get into any
confrontation over that?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.689
Violence isn't an
automatic response

05:21.722 --> 05:22.956
to conflict, Agent Epps.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.459
No, but it's a popular one,
Ms. Salton.

05:25.493 --> 05:29.797
Eva, what was Finn's
thesis topic?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.599
It was an engineer's perspective

05:31.632 --> 05:33.834
on the work of architect
Gaar Haybridge.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.469
He designed the Cole Center
downtown.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.971
Right, he also did
the Keyerleber Annex.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.541
Something very inviting about
that entrance, don't you think?

05:40.574 --> 05:42.876
Yes, there is.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.645
Finn was an intense kid.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.480
He was obsessive about

05:46.514 --> 05:47.280
researching his thesis,

05:47.314 --> 05:48.982
but he was falling
behind schedule.

05:49.016 --> 05:49.850
When you say intense,

05:49.883 --> 05:51.785
you mean intense enough
to kill himself?

05:55.489 --> 05:58.592
All right, well, I'd like to
take a look at his research.

06:00.528 --> 06:04.665
Here is the key to his office
in the library.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.501
Thanks for your cooperation,
Mrs. Salton.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.503
Anytime, Fed.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.704
Thanks, Eva.

06:10.738 --> 06:13.073
DON:
"Keyerleber Annex"?

06:13.106 --> 06:15.409
Yeah, well, I was actually
staking out a bank

06:15.443 --> 06:17.478
for three weeks right
across the street

06:17.511 --> 06:18.812
and they had a plaque
that described

06:18.846 --> 06:20.080
its architectural
significance.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.950
Look, I think we should check
out this kid's work, all right?

06:22.983 --> 06:25.018
You think his research has
some bearing on his death?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.554
Sure. If he was
hitting dead ends,

06:26.587 --> 06:28.956
or he was late on his
thesis, I mean, it might.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.635
CHARLIE:
Excuse me.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.537
Uh, can we help you?

06:43.571 --> 06:48.442
I'm a professor in the math
department, Charlie Epps.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.480
I'm really just so sorry
for your loss.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.414
You just need
to excuse me.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.985
Honey...

07:02.022 --> 07:03.457
Are you, uh...

07:03.491 --> 07:05.726
Were you one of Finn's teachers?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.495
No, I wasn't.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.698
He had come to me for some help
with some calculations

07:10.731 --> 07:12.633
that he was doing
for his thesis.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.903
That thesis-- he was under
a lot of pressure

07:15.936 --> 07:17.705
trying to get that done.

07:19.072 --> 07:22.776
He sounded tired,
frustrated--

07:22.810 --> 07:24.912
that people didn't
understand his work.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.080
I didn't understand it either.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.617
He was speaking
a different language.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.919
Maybe if I'd slowed down,

07:31.952 --> 07:35.556
taken more time
with him...

07:35.589 --> 07:37.958
These are beautiful sketches,
Mr. Montgomery.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.494
They're all
Haybridge buildings.

07:40.528 --> 07:43.230
Finn said
the designs were perfect.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.234
He could see so much more
than I ever could.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.672
Mr. Montgomery, would you mind

07:51.705 --> 07:54.274
if I, um, looked over
some of Finn's research?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.710
Because he asked me for help
on his thesis.

07:58.612 --> 08:03.150
When you're done, would you...
would you walk me through it?

08:03.183 --> 08:06.119
If I can understand my son's
life a little bit better,

08:06.153 --> 08:08.522
I might be able to
understand why he died.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.572
I mean, I really don't think
it's murder,

08:24.605 --> 08:27.074
but Charlie's got something
stuck in his craw

08:27.107 --> 08:28.208
and he's done right by us, so...

08:28.241 --> 08:30.578
TERRY: David and I will drop by
the medical examiner's,

08:30.611 --> 08:31.679
see what he has to say.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.113
It's got to be on the side,
right?

08:33.146 --> 08:34.114
If it weren't my brother,

08:34.147 --> 08:35.182
I'd never hear the end of it.
I'd stay away.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.118
TERRY: Okay... and I can check
out the kid's bio

08:38.151 --> 08:39.753
for signs he was depressed.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.723
Well, on behalf of
the Brothers Epps, I thank you.

08:42.756 --> 08:43.991
I'll talk to you later.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.659
You know, you didn't
have to come with me.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.995
It's your first jumper--
they can be a little intense.

08:48.028 --> 08:52.132
So, what's the FBI doing, nosing
around a probable suicide?

08:52.165 --> 08:54.802
Agent Epps has a personal
connection to the case.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.573
As you can see, victim suffered
extensive facial trauma.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.241
Broken jaw,

09:01.274 --> 09:03.110
busted zygomatic arch,

09:03.143 --> 09:06.179
typical with
face-first falls.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.948
Skull damage is extensive.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.150
Cause of death was impact
from the fall.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.952
Any indication
that he was attacked

09:11.985 --> 09:14.054
or knocked unconscious
prior to falling?

09:14.087 --> 09:15.723
If anything happened
to his face,

09:15.756 --> 09:16.990
it would be impossible to tell.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.659
But none of his
other injuries

09:18.692 --> 09:20.661
suggest an altercation
or struggle.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.229
You okay?

09:23.631 --> 09:25.633
Yeah.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.267
John, what's, what's
our bottom line?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.670
Odds are, this is a suicide.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.572
But I can't rule out
completely a homicide.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.676
Thank you.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.177
Come on, let's go.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.379
DON: I understand Finn got you
kicked out of here?

09:39.412 --> 09:41.682
MALONE:
Montgomery could've come to me,

09:41.715 --> 09:43.917
given me a chance to redo
the experiment.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.620
I would have done that.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.155
And, instead, he gets you
booted out of school.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.757
Boy, I know how
that'd make me feel.

09:49.790 --> 09:50.891
I'm not saying
I didn't fantasize

09:50.924 --> 09:52.159
about throwing
him off a bridge.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.731
His girlfriend dumped him
a couple weeks ago, you know.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.400
And he was always stressing
out about his thesis.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.169
That's normal, isn't it?

10:02.202 --> 10:05.072
Finn took it to the next level.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.641
Brian, where were
you last night?

10:07.675 --> 10:10.377
Friends came by
to help me pack.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.780
Crashed around 6:00 a.m.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.347
Am I a murder suspect?

10:14.381 --> 10:16.416
That's actually kind of cool.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.652
That's funny. I'm going
to need the names...

10:18.686 --> 10:20.821
numbers of your friends.

10:27.761 --> 10:28.962
Dad...

10:28.996 --> 10:29.897
what are you doing here?

10:29.930 --> 10:31.699
I called you;
you hadn't called me back.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.666
I would've eventually.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.267
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.937
I need you to come to dinner
at the house on Wednesday.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.438
Um, I have a date.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.273
Oh, yeah, a date?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.441
Hey, well, that's good.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.242
With who?

10:42.275 --> 10:44.311
Oh, someone Art knows
from yoga.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.713
Yeah, her name's Jill.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.447
He says she's smart,
she's funny and, uh,

10:47.480 --> 10:49.182
quite flexible.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.351
So I... we're having dinner
at the house

10:51.384 --> 10:52.786
and I would like you
to be there.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.354
Wow, hey, no.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.989
Just take her
somewhere low-key.

10:56.023 --> 10:56.924
You'll be fine.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.859
Look, it's my first date
in over 35 years.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.861
I would like "memorable"
instead of "low-key."

11:00.894 --> 11:03.063
"Low-key" and "memorable"
aren't mutually exclusive.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.798
You know what
my favorite date ever was?

11:04.832 --> 11:06.266
Pepperoni pizza in a Laundromat.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.735
Yes, which explains the
conspicuous absence

11:07.768 --> 11:09.169
of grandchildren.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.004
So, Wednesday, 7:30.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.139
Bring a date?
I can't.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.207
Dad, I'm busy, and I don't
anticipate meeting anyone

11:14.241 --> 11:15.342
between now and then either.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.845
No, I just want to make it
a couples thing, you know.

11:17.878 --> 11:18.712
- Looking like, seeming like...
- Well, I don't think...

11:20.513 --> 11:22.215
Hi. Hey.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.383
Mr. Epps.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.417
Good to see you.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.086
You, too.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.755
You'll think of something.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.125
Give me a forensic
psychologist's take

11:32.159 --> 11:33.126
on Finn Montgomery.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.763
He went to university
mental health four times

11:35.796 --> 11:37.731
during the past two months
for major depression.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.467
Insurance records show he ran
out of his anti-depressant

11:40.500 --> 11:41.969
three weeks ago,
never got a refill.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.371
All right, so he breaks up
with his girlfriend,

11:44.404 --> 11:47.040
he falls behind on his work,
he stops taking the meds.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.976
From a forensic psychologist's
point of view,

11:49.009 --> 11:49.977
it is what it is.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.478
It is what it is.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.820
( knocking on door )

11:59.853 --> 12:01.822
Oh, hey, Charlie.
Here you are. Look.

12:01.855 --> 12:02.756
Hey.

12:02.790 --> 12:03.791
I've been looking through
Finn's research.

12:03.824 --> 12:04.825
He's made some very
interesting observations.

12:04.858 --> 12:05.826
- May I show you?
- I'm sorry. I just came by

12:05.859 --> 12:08.862
to tell you we cannot
take this any further.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.031
I mean, to us,
it's clearly a suicide.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.766
No, I don't think so.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.935
I know you don't want to think
so, but listen, if you just

12:14.968 --> 12:16.536
step back from your
personal feelings,

12:16.569 --> 12:18.538
I think you'll see...

12:18.571 --> 12:22.509
Look, I'm not denying that
I feel some component of guilt.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.476
But I've made these adjustments

12:23.510 --> 12:25.946
based solely on
the circumstances involved.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.514
This kid had some
serious problems, okay?

12:27.547 --> 12:29.549
A student conference
was not going to save his life.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.785
Don't assume I'm being
so irrational, you know?

12:31.819 --> 12:33.520
Just because I'm not
as detached as you are.

12:33.553 --> 12:34.454
Hey, hold it.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.489
Look, you got no idea
the daily horrors

12:36.523 --> 12:37.490
my job serves up to me.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.093
Detached... yeah, you're right,
I'm detached.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.294
That's how I function.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.130
I'm sorry, I know, I know.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.998
No, you don't know.
Look, Charlie,

12:45.032 --> 12:46.834
I'm glad
you don't know.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.969
Terry and David gave you a day,
okay.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.437
I pulled some
favors for you.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.805
These people work hard.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.841
I can't spend any more
resources on this.

12:53.874 --> 12:54.842
You won't, you mean.

12:54.875 --> 12:55.575
Right, I won't.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.910
Larry.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.011
Hey, Don, how's it...?

12:58.045 --> 12:59.146
- Good.
- Okay.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.292
Something I can help you with?

13:31.244 --> 13:33.613
Well, it's evident
Finn was obsessed

13:33.646 --> 13:38.218
with the design and construction
of the Cole Center Building.

13:38.251 --> 13:41.121
There was some problem here
that he was trying to solve,

13:41.154 --> 13:43.323
that he needed my help with.

13:43.356 --> 13:47.427
So we must infer
that it involves math.

13:47.460 --> 13:51.899
Oh... if I'd given him
five minutes...

13:51.932 --> 13:54.367
Yeah, well, or ten...
or a week.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.003
It might've made
all the difference in the world

13:56.036 --> 13:56.904
or none at all.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.372
You know, Charlie,
look at this way...

13:59.406 --> 14:00.874
you've got Einstein,

14:00.908 --> 14:03.944
dead for decades...
Descartes-- centuries.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.246
A scholar's research
continues to speak

14:06.279 --> 14:08.115
long after he's gone.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.483
And somewhere,
in all of this,

14:10.517 --> 14:15.188
Finn Montgomery's going to find
a way to talk to you.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.957
Well, let's see,

14:16.990 --> 14:19.026
he's got engineering plans,

14:19.059 --> 14:21.895
soil reports,
inspection updates.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.999
Meteorological data.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.035
Well, how does that
relate to a thesis

14:28.068 --> 14:30.270
on Gaar Haybridge
and the Cole Center Building?

14:30.303 --> 14:33.273
The same math used
in aeronautical design

14:33.306 --> 14:34.241
and fluid dynamics

14:34.274 --> 14:37.477
also predicts how a building
behaves in wind.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.946
And he was interested

14:38.979 --> 14:41.214
in knowing how the building
would react

14:41.248 --> 14:42.615
to different weather conditions.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.686
Suggests that
he was investigating

14:46.719 --> 14:47.720
a structural issue.

14:47.754 --> 14:51.291
I need to check out
the Cole Center in person.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.996
( elevator bell dings )

15:38.405 --> 15:40.273
Excuse me.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.708
What are you doing?

15:41.741 --> 15:42.976
A simple experiment.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.711
It's a pendulum.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.713
Sir, you and the pendulum
need to leave.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.215
Okay.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.017
- It drew an ellipse.
- Now.

15:52.085 --> 15:55.188
On paper, the design's sound.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.624
From the simple experiments
I carried out,

15:57.657 --> 15:59.092
I can tell you

15:59.126 --> 16:00.627
that the construction
of the Cole Center

16:00.660 --> 16:03.330
does not match these plans--
that in fact,

16:03.363 --> 16:06.033
the building experiences
excessive wind deflection.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.167
For the non-engineers here...?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.168
Deflection?

16:08.201 --> 16:10.370
Uh, the degree to which
a vertical line bends

16:10.403 --> 16:11.671
when force is applied.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.041
A stalk of wheat
deflects a lot.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.109
An oak tree much less so.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.078
Bottom line me.
Is the building unsafe?

16:18.111 --> 16:19.479
I'd need to run
some simulations,

16:19.512 --> 16:20.580
I need to find out,

16:20.613 --> 16:22.115
you know,
what are we talking about.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.384
Are we talking about
cracked plaster

16:24.417 --> 16:26.453
or something way more serious?

16:31.724 --> 16:35.162
Finn believed something
was seriously wrong

16:35.195 --> 16:36.196
with this building,

16:36.229 --> 16:38.565
but he didn't know what it was.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.534
I have to answer that question
for him.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.637
The data I collected yesterday
showed me

16:44.671 --> 16:46.573
that the Cole Center deflects
six degrees

16:46.606 --> 16:47.707
in 30-mile-per-hour winds,

16:47.740 --> 16:50.477
so I've programmed this model
to do exactly the same.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.812
It won't pinpoint a specific
structural problem...

16:52.845 --> 16:55.315
But it'll show how a building
that deflects that much

16:55.348 --> 16:57.050
will react under different types
of stresses.

16:57.084 --> 16:57.684
That's right.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.355
If Charlie's right, and the
Cole Center wasn't built

17:02.389 --> 17:03.490
according to its plans...

17:03.523 --> 17:05.525
Someone made
a legitimate mistake

17:05.558 --> 17:06.493
or committed fraud,

17:06.526 --> 17:08.461
which makes Finn
a potential whistle-blower,

17:08.495 --> 17:09.296
and that exposes the Cole

17:09.329 --> 17:10.430
to millions in damages
and repairs.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.433
Not to mention a lot of
bad publicity for the building

17:13.466 --> 17:16.069
and everyone whose name is
on it-- architect, contractor...

17:16.103 --> 17:17.104
Owner.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.238
Finn Montgomery's
phone records

17:18.271 --> 17:20.407
have him calling Elliot Cole's
office several times.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.774
As well as Haybridge,
the architect,

17:21.808 --> 17:23.543
and Nevelson Contracting.

17:23.576 --> 17:26.146
We have motive and suspects.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.648
Yeah, what we don't have
is evidence of a homicide.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.184
DR. SABELLO: I was finishing up
the Montgomery autopsy

17:31.218 --> 17:32.285
and found this.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.553
Wasn't here before.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.554
When the heart stops,

17:34.587 --> 17:37.157
so does the flow of blood
to broken vessels.

17:37.190 --> 17:41.261
But fluids thinner than blood
keep moving, very slowly.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.430
As a result, injuries incurred
just prior to death

17:43.463 --> 17:45.732
take at least 24 hours
for the bruising to occur.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.667
So Finn Montgomery
was injured

17:47.700 --> 17:49.736
before he fell off
that bridge.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.572
This could be a defensive wound
from an object like a pipe.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.174
Someone swung at his head...

17:54.207 --> 17:55.542
He put up his arm
to block it maybe.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.544
Of course, it could have
been self-inflicted.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.879
Maybe while he was
climbing over the rail,

17:59.912 --> 18:01.648
or maybe he struck
his arm on the way down.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.550
Those are two very different
"could haves."

18:03.583 --> 18:05.418
Get me the object used.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.354
I might be able to match it
back to the injury.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.621
Okay.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.291
DON: Mr. Nevelson, we'd like to
talk to you

18:11.324 --> 18:12.559
about Finn Montgomery.

18:12.592 --> 18:16.129
He called you about structural
problems with the Cole Center.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.265
If I answered the phone
for every amateur architect

18:18.298 --> 18:20.800
and random complaint,
nothing would ever get built.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.335
Besides, I had
enough trouble

18:22.369 --> 18:23.603
with the owner on that build;

18:23.636 --> 18:25.638
I wanted to move on.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.541
Elliot Cole has a reputation
as a micromanager, right?

18:28.575 --> 18:30.610
Yeah. That's how I knew
the kid was blowing smoke.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.679
Cole Center passed
every inspection.

18:32.712 --> 18:33.746
Cole wouldn't have
anything less.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.815
FBI!

18:35.848 --> 18:37.484
What'd we do wrong
this time?

18:37.517 --> 18:38.551
What did you do wrong
last time?

18:38.585 --> 18:40.353
NEVELSON:
This is Bob Mazzelli.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.554
Chief of Security.

18:41.588 --> 18:44.491
Are you aware that even without
talking about inspections,

18:44.524 --> 18:46.859
the Cole Center doesn't match
plans on file with the city.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.561
I don't know anything about
that, but my guys

18:48.595 --> 18:50.697
did the work exactly the way
they were supposed to.

18:50.730 --> 18:51.664
In '94, the city attorney

18:51.698 --> 18:52.765
investigated your company

18:52.799 --> 18:55.302
for a case involving stolen
construction materials.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.303
They investigated

18:56.336 --> 18:57.737
seven companies, hon.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.472
Ours wasn't one of the two
that got indicted.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.474
If you're having problems
with the Cole Center,

19:01.508 --> 19:03.610
I think you have to look for
the lunatic that designed it--

19:03.643 --> 19:05.578
the architect-- Haybridge.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.480
Okay. Thanks.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.515
NEVELSON:
Thanks.

19:10.683 --> 19:11.784
Is it just me, or
you get the feeling

19:11.818 --> 19:13.320
that security guy
kind of liked you?

19:13.353 --> 19:14.554
Cat and dog thing.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.489
Some guys like women
who can handcuff them.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.325
Can't blame him for that.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.928
Hey...

19:21.961 --> 19:23.696
what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

19:23.730 --> 19:25.798
My dad's cooking
for his friend Jill.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.601
What, you mean like,
a double date?

19:28.635 --> 19:30.403
No, no, I mean,
he'd be on a date.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.738
You'd just be
doing me a favor.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.540
We can talk about work.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.842
Nice to see your social skills
are as sharp as ever.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.810
Terry, I'm just trying
to be up-front.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.679
I don't want there
to be any weirdness.

19:39.712 --> 19:40.813
You know,
given our history.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.582
No weirdness, Don.
Just history.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.384
That a "yes"?

19:44.417 --> 19:45.385
Maybe.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.619
If I let you bring
your cuffs?

19:46.653 --> 19:48.621
( laughs )

19:48.655 --> 19:49.856
Well, in that case...

19:49.889 --> 19:51.758
DAVID: Mr. Haybridge,
were you contacted

19:51.791 --> 19:53.993
about possible problems
with the Cole Center?

19:54.026 --> 19:56.729
HAYBRIDGE: Yes, I spoke with a
Mr. Montgomery.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.566
I told him he was wrong.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.668
The Cole Center wouldn't be
the first of your designs

20:01.701 --> 20:03.770
to have structural issues.

20:03.803 --> 20:04.971
The concert hall
in Seattle...

20:05.004 --> 20:06.739
Had a minor problem.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.475
A quickly remedied
minor problem.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.543
We experimented with
thin concrete flooring,

20:10.577 --> 20:11.511
it didn't work out.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.712
I might also add

20:12.745 --> 20:13.980
the financiers only
noticed the sagging

20:14.013 --> 20:15.582
when I brought it
to their attention.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.850
Great. Do any experimenting
with the Cole Center?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.018
No.

20:19.051 --> 20:19.986
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:20.019 --> 20:21.988
I have clients waiting
back at the office.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.591
Mr. Haybridge, please don't make
me follow you to your office

20:24.624 --> 20:26.526
and question you about
fraud and possible murder

20:26.559 --> 20:30.897
in front of your clients.

20:30.930 --> 20:34.701
Look, the Cole Center
is my signature building.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.604
But Cole froze me out
after the design phase.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.038
Why would he do that?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.840
Because I'm Gaar Haybridge,

20:40.873 --> 20:43.343
and my buildings are famous
because they're designed by me.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.845
Elliot Cole wanted to be the big
man behind the Cole Center.

20:45.878 --> 20:46.913
You think he might
have cut any corners,

20:46.946 --> 20:48.948
authorized any changes

20:48.981 --> 20:51.351
that could've compromised
the structure's integrity?

20:51.384 --> 20:52.352
Not knowingly.

20:52.385 --> 20:55.588
Cole expects that building
to last forever...

20:55.622 --> 20:57.357
as a monument to himself.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.328
Hi, I'm Rachel.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.829
Mr. Cole will be with you
in a minute.

21:02.862 --> 21:03.963
You can follow me.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.540
He's just
completed a call.

21:13.573 --> 21:14.741
Would you like a seat?

21:16.809 --> 21:17.910
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:17.944 --> 21:21.748
Listen, you're looking at equity
of about $200 million.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.684
Because I know
everything, Steven.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.620
Well, check your numbers
and we'll talk tomorrow.

21:27.654 --> 21:28.755
Thank you.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.457
Sorry about that.
How can I help you?

21:30.490 --> 21:31.758
We're looking into the death

21:31.791 --> 21:34.561
of a young CalSci student
named Finn Montgomery.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.363
Ever try a standing desk?

21:36.396 --> 21:37.697
It's fantastic.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.798
You know, Mozart used one.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.434
Uh, Montgomery...

21:41.468 --> 21:42.802
The engineering student
who thought

21:42.835 --> 21:44.537
there was something wrong
with the building.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.606
We directed his calls
to the PR Department.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.007
Is this the Michaelson
agreement?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.377
I don't see the changes
I asked for.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.811
Yes, they're listed
under Addendum C.

21:51.844 --> 21:52.779
- Oh.
- He may have actually

21:52.812 --> 21:54.981
discovered a structural flaw
in the building.

21:55.014 --> 21:58.751
A student found something
that the architect,

21:58.785 --> 22:00.119
the project engineer,

22:00.152 --> 22:02.455
three dozen city inspectors,
and I missed?

22:02.489 --> 22:04.791
Yes. It might explain
why there's evidence

22:04.824 --> 22:06.726
Montgomery
may have been murdered.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.795
Oh, I see.

22:08.828 --> 22:09.929
So we're talking
conspiracy here.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.063
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.064
Well, you did put

22:12.098 --> 22:13.666
$300 million
of your own money

22:13.700 --> 22:14.967
into the building.
Isn't that correct?

22:15.001 --> 22:16.669
Yes.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.004
And the overruns forced you
into bankruptcy?

22:18.037 --> 22:20.373
Yes, and the success
of this building

22:20.407 --> 22:22.809
got me out of bankruptcy

22:22.842 --> 22:24.777
and into a very profitable
phase of my career.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.514
Right. But during a
non-profitable phase,

22:27.547 --> 22:28.581
it might make sense for you

22:28.615 --> 22:30.883
to do everything to stop
hemorrhaging cash, right?

22:30.917 --> 22:32.785
I love spending money.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.821
I love making money.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.557
Taking risks comes with
the territory on both.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.859
So, please,
do your due diligence,

22:39.892 --> 22:41.594
send in
an inspection team.

22:41.628 --> 22:44.531
This building is
as safe as kittens.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.866
Thank you for your time.

22:46.899 --> 22:47.867
Oh, you're welcome.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.969
Uh... and if
I did cut corners--

22:50.002 --> 22:53.606
if I had compromised the safety
of this building in any way--

22:53.640 --> 22:54.974
would I have my office in it?

22:56.008 --> 22:57.910
We'll be in touch.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.047
Let's try
an earthquake

23:01.080 --> 23:03.082
with a magnitude
of 8.2.

23:03.115 --> 23:06.919
A minor structural warning

23:06.953 --> 23:10.857
but, seismically,
the building appears solid.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.625
I owe it to Finn
to find out

23:12.659 --> 23:14.694
what's wrong
with this building.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.464
Let's see how it does
in high winds.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.770
ALAN:
You know, when I was working

23:23.803 --> 23:25.905
as a city planner,
I saw every shortcut

23:25.938 --> 23:27.206
in the books.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.576
You know, kickbacks,
overbilling,

23:29.609 --> 23:31.077
pulling rebar
from one job

23:31.110 --> 23:33.112
and trying
to use it in another.

23:33.145 --> 23:34.113
Oh... sorry.

23:34.146 --> 23:37.049
I make Cole for a narcissist,
not a sociopath.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.518
I get the feeling
he's only interested

23:38.551 --> 23:39.619
in victories he can brag about.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.488
Oh, my God!

23:41.521 --> 23:43.089
The bread... in the oven.
I forgot.

23:43.122 --> 23:46.459
Relax. I got it. Just relax.

23:46.493 --> 23:47.894
I'm just a little nervous.

23:47.927 --> 23:48.728
Don't worry.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.563
Everything looks wonderful.
In fact,

23:50.597 --> 23:52.665
your son could learn
a few things from you.

23:52.699 --> 23:54.467
You know where we went
on our first date?

23:54.501 --> 23:55.635
All right,

23:55.668 --> 23:56.435
all right, all right.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.237
A Laundromat.
Dinner was pizza.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.071
A little professionalism,

23:59.105 --> 24:00.640
- You don't say?
- Please. All right?

24:00.673 --> 24:01.908
- Let's just...
- Oh, interesting.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.876
( doorbell rings )

24:03.910 --> 24:04.911
The building
is within

24:04.944 --> 24:07.880
all required limits
for earthquakes and wind.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.883
And the tests
seem fairly conclusive.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.886
I feel like we're...
we're missing something.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.957
Whatever Finn uncovered must
have been something significant.

24:17.990 --> 24:21.160
Charles,
can I tell you a story?

24:21.193 --> 24:23.630
Yes, please.
As long as it's not

24:23.663 --> 24:27.934
another parable from the lives
of the great mathematicians.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.969
No. This is about
a sophomore student

24:30.002 --> 24:31.904
I once had--
Kevin Flannermans.

24:31.938 --> 24:32.972
This was 20 years ago.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.908
Kevin hanged himself.

24:35.942 --> 24:41.013
Right. Well,
Finn didn't kill himself.

24:41.047 --> 24:44.150
Well, but, maybe just
the possibility that he did--

24:44.183 --> 24:47.687
maybe that is the variable
that you are disallowing

24:47.720 --> 24:49.255
from the problem.

24:49.288 --> 24:53.259
He came to me
with an important question.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.161
I owe him an answer.

24:55.194 --> 25:00.767
Okay, well, you've ingeniously
sidestepped my point.

25:00.800 --> 25:05.905
You know, there are
a few rare wind events

25:05.938 --> 25:07.774
that we haven't tested.

25:11.611 --> 25:14.013
I'm sorry.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.649
Usually, talking about
hobbies is a smart move.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.184
I'm supposed to
know Jill's mother

25:18.217 --> 25:21.053
died in a skiing accident? How?!

25:21.087 --> 25:22.254
She's stopped crying.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.690
It's funny
how Charlie

25:23.723 --> 25:26.959
gets stuck at the office
at all the right times.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.895
Okay. We'll have
a good meal,

25:28.928 --> 25:31.698
some nice wine and some pleasant
conversation.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.032
Everything will be fine.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.334
Just tell me you asked
if she eats everything.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.036
She's not a vegetarian.
I asked.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.304
What do you think I am? Stupid?

25:39.606 --> 25:41.207
I sure hope you like duck.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.809
Oh, yes, I do. I have two--

25:42.842 --> 25:44.343
Paddles and
Mr. Waddlesworth.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.045
Oh, my God!

25:46.078 --> 25:48.815
I don't eat it.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.917
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I'll take it away.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.019
( phone rings )

25:53.052 --> 25:54.721
Yeah?

25:54.754 --> 25:57.356
Right.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.325
Okay, okay. Alright. Right. Yep.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.127
We're on our way. Yep.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.195
Dad, sorry. We got to go.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.697
Sure. Go ahead.

26:04.731 --> 26:05.998
Couldn't get any worse.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.700
Listen. Alcohol.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.168
Lots of alcohol.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.037
For who?

26:11.070 --> 26:13.272
CHARLIE:
The problem is wind.

26:13.305 --> 26:16.008
Wouldn't they have already
tested for stability in winds?

26:16.042 --> 26:17.877
Engineers test
structural response

26:17.910 --> 26:19.011
to gusts
along two axes:

26:19.045 --> 26:20.279
north to south
and east to west.

26:20.312 --> 26:23.816
And, in those cases, a single
side supported by two corners

26:23.850 --> 26:25.652
bears the brunt
of the wind load.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.654
Think of a
straight-on wind

26:27.687 --> 26:29.121
as two cars
colliding.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.357
In contrast-- excuse me--

26:31.390 --> 26:35.261
quartering winds hit a building
at an angle,

26:35.294 --> 26:39.966
exerting pressure on two sides
anchored by a single corner.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.668
Imagine a car getting hit

26:41.701 --> 26:44.270
from the back and the side
simultaneously.

26:44.303 --> 26:47.139
Can those winds
cause structural issues?

26:47.173 --> 26:48.641
Our tests showed

26:48.675 --> 26:51.410
that the Cole Center is sound
for head-on winds

26:51.443 --> 26:53.079
of up to 90 miles per hour.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.114
But here's what happens
with quartering winds

26:55.147 --> 26:58.150
as low as 60 miles per hour.

26:59.786 --> 27:02.054
First, the steel frame bends
beyond its limits,

27:02.088 --> 27:04.891
and stays bent.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.694
Then this strained steel hardens
and becomes brittle.

27:07.727 --> 27:10.997
Under continuing stress,
this steel will fracture,

27:11.030 --> 27:12.965
causing complete
structural collapse.

27:12.999 --> 27:15.735
Finn Montgomery
found the problem

27:15.768 --> 27:17.169
in the building's deflection.

27:17.203 --> 27:19.071
He suspected the effects
would be serious.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.007
I could really
use your advice

27:21.040 --> 27:23.776
on some calculations
in my engineering thesis.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.277
He was right.

27:25.311 --> 27:28.815
And he may have paid
with his life.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.390
CHARLIE:
Our simulation demonstrates

27:38.424 --> 27:40.392
that the Cole Center
could experience failure

27:40.426 --> 27:41.961
in a 60 mile-per-hour
quartering wind.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.362
Now, as the head
of the Department

27:43.395 --> 27:45.231
of Building and Safety,
you've got to realize

27:45.264 --> 27:48.134
what a huge, imminent risk
that poses when the building

27:48.167 --> 27:48.968
is filled with people.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.137
Are you a structural engineer?
Hmm?

27:51.170 --> 27:52.104
No.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.173
An expert in wind dynamics?

27:54.206 --> 27:56.408
He is a professor
of applied mathematics.

27:56.442 --> 27:59.145
He's talking theory
and supposition.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.780
If any of this goes public,

28:00.813 --> 28:03.282
I will sue the FBI
for slander.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.718
Professor Eppes,
I respect your background

28:05.752 --> 28:07.019
and reputation,
but I can't make a decision...

28:07.053 --> 28:09.455
Well, do me a favor,
and forget my reputation.

28:09.488 --> 28:13.059
Consider what happened
in Kansas City. In 1981,

28:13.092 --> 28:14.360
The Hyatt Regency
walkway collapsed.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.095
Killed 114 people.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.429
In Hartford, in 1978,

28:17.463 --> 28:20.132
the structure
of a sports arena failed.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.301
Those involved fraud
and malfeasance.

28:22.334 --> 28:26.038
Serious building flaws were
found in each of those cases.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.007
Can you connect the Cole
Center's deflection

28:28.040 --> 28:29.441
to a specific structural issue?

28:29.475 --> 28:31.477
Because of the potential risk of
casualties,

28:31.510 --> 28:34.146
we think it's something
you should take very seriously.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.482
You want to ruin
my building's reputation?

28:36.515 --> 28:38.117
- We want to save lives.
- Render it worthless

28:38.150 --> 28:40.019
on an obscure and nonspecific

28:40.052 --> 28:41.120
theory?

28:41.153 --> 28:41.988
Look, I can't point

28:42.021 --> 28:43.890
to a specific problem
at this time,

28:43.923 --> 28:45.091
but let me tell you something.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.393
The evidence
is there.

28:47.426 --> 28:48.861
Mr. Cole, you're going

28:48.895 --> 28:50.229
to have
to leave now

28:50.262 --> 28:52.064
if you're going
to make your board meeting.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.165
Thank you.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.300
Gentlemen,

28:54.333 --> 28:55.367
the Cole Center

28:55.401 --> 28:56.769
is me.

28:56.803 --> 28:59.071
It's my reputation
and my public image.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.473
I stand
by its integrity.

29:04.376 --> 29:07.213
Given the lack
of specific evidence,

29:07.246 --> 29:09.015
I'd say we're done.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.116
Wha...?!

29:10.149 --> 29:11.317
The engineers

29:11.350 --> 29:13.052
who examined this
building last night

29:13.085 --> 29:16.088
couldn't locate a problem in
any section they could inspect.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.224
So the logical conclusion
is whatever's wrong

29:18.257 --> 29:20.559
with this building is
underground-- in the foundation.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.931
Right. Well, I'm going to go see
they guy who built it.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.332
Guy was a pompous ass.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.969
So my son discovered a
structural

29:30.002 --> 29:30.903
flaw in this building?

29:30.937 --> 29:32.972
He noted that the
building didn't react

29:33.005 --> 29:34.240
to wind as it
was designed to.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.208
Well, he didn't know
the specific cause.

29:36.242 --> 29:37.810
How could he figure that out?

29:37.844 --> 29:39.211
Just by looking
at the blueprints?

29:39.245 --> 29:41.914
No, or else other people would
have noticed it first.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.816
No, Finn actually
went a lot further.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.484
He... he noticed
something was wrong

29:45.517 --> 29:47.519
because he was passionate
and thorough.

29:47.553 --> 29:48.955
He wanted to understand this
building.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.089
And, when something
didn't make sense,

29:50.122 --> 29:51.523
he needed to know why.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.559
So you're trying
to find exactly

29:53.592 --> 29:55.862
what's wrong
with the Cole Center.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.596
It might take some time but,
well,

29:57.629 --> 29:59.531
we won't stop
working on it either.

30:05.337 --> 30:06.405
We know you cut corners

30:06.438 --> 30:08.307
on the construction
of the Cole Center foundation.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.475
You're doing
a lot of fishing

30:09.508 --> 30:10.910
for a guy who
knows something.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.411
Look, whether you cheaped out
on the rebar

30:12.444 --> 30:14.146
or you didn't drive
the piles deep enough,

30:14.180 --> 30:15.848
we're going to find
out what you did,

30:15.882 --> 30:17.283
and we're going
to nail you for it.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.151
A subpoena for
all your records

30:19.185 --> 30:20.486
of the Cole
Center foundation.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.554
FBI accountants are going
to go over every page.

30:22.588 --> 30:25.091
We're going to find out
what you did.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.560
Knock yourself out.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.399
Yo!

30:33.432 --> 30:36.068
We're in here.

30:36.102 --> 30:38.504
Hey, Dad. All right,
FBI accountants

30:38.537 --> 30:40.572
went over a11 of
Nevelson's financials,

30:40.606 --> 30:43.242
and these are all the documents
that relate to the foundation.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.276
Our people could find nothing.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.211
So why didn't you have Charlie

30:45.244 --> 30:46.879
look at the records
in the first place?

30:46.913 --> 30:47.713
The FBI
has a team

30:47.746 --> 30:49.215
of excellent
forensic accountants.

30:49.248 --> 30:50.382
I know,
but it wouldn't

30:50.416 --> 30:52.251
be the first time you find
something that they missed.

30:52.284 --> 30:55.221
A lot of mathematicians do have
eidetic numerical memory.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.123
It allows us
to recognize numbers

30:57.156 --> 30:58.324
when they've been repeated

30:58.357 --> 31:00.026
or arranged
in patterns.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.194
Why don't you do that,
and I'll do the dishes.

31:02.228 --> 31:03.262
How's that?

31:05.231 --> 31:06.465
I'll give you a hand.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.000
So you mean your
best date ever

31:08.034 --> 31:09.168
was with
your partner?

31:09.201 --> 31:10.669
Dad, please.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.939
No, it's just
a simple observation.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.373
I mean, if
it was so great,

31:14.406 --> 31:15.674
why did you split up?

31:15.707 --> 31:17.143
It was an academy thing.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.544
We got posted
to different places.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.479
We had our careers
to concentrate on.

31:20.512 --> 31:23.215
So now you're in the same city,
same careers...

31:23.249 --> 31:24.350
Same office.

31:24.383 --> 31:25.484
Which, in our case,

31:25.517 --> 31:27.286
can be
a dangerous thing.

31:27.319 --> 31:29.055
Your mother
and I met at work.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.256
In the lunch line.

31:30.289 --> 31:33.092
Look, Dad, Terry and I have
to see each other every day,

31:33.125 --> 31:34.626
We have to look out
for each other.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.229
So that means any trust issues
are already behind you.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.665
Look, just because you're eager
to start dating again...

31:39.698 --> 31:40.632
Eager? Are you kidding me?

31:40.666 --> 31:41.500
You saw me last night.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.369
I know,
I know, I know.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.237
I got to get
back into it.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.073
Your mother
said I should

31:47.106 --> 31:49.541
meet new people
after she was gone.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.277
Well, that's right.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.979
That sounds like her.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.313
She made me promise.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.615
I mean, she knew that,
without a push,

31:56.648 --> 31:58.050
that I might not do it.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.285
So she pushed.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.555
Just consider this your push.

32:03.589 --> 32:06.458
Now, here is a list
of workers employed

32:06.492 --> 32:08.494
in building
the foundation.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.029
And?

32:10.062 --> 32:12.331
And a lot of them
don't exist.

32:12.364 --> 32:14.533
Yeah. There's a preponderance of
fours and sevens

32:14.566 --> 32:16.135
in the union ID numbers,

32:16.168 --> 32:18.370
which could be due
to accounting codes,

32:18.404 --> 32:20.406
except they show up in
the overtime hours--

32:20.439 --> 32:22.641
like, 14s
and 17s everywhere--

32:22.674 --> 32:25.344
here, here and here--
14... 17...

32:25.377 --> 32:28.047
These numbers, they
can't be explained

32:28.080 --> 32:29.415
by random occurrence.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.250
Somebody made them up.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.019
They've been
fabricated

32:33.052 --> 32:34.586
by someone
who likes these numbers--

32:34.620 --> 32:36.655
who left behind
a pretty obvious pattern.

32:36.688 --> 32:38.157
Obvious to you.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.359
Here's a very
interesting thing also.

32:40.392 --> 32:43.362
All the... all the workers I've
identified as fake

32:43.395 --> 32:44.630
are listed
as welders.

32:44.663 --> 32:47.366
Except there aren't any other
welders on the payroll backup.

32:47.399 --> 32:50.302
ALAN: You can't build a
foundation without welders.

32:50.336 --> 32:54.373
Sounds like Nevelson
was using a shadow crew.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.542
So how would that work, Dad?

32:56.575 --> 32:58.344
Nonunion laborers,
usually illegal aliens.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.412
They pay them
under the table.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.414
See, the contractors
would use them at night

33:02.448 --> 33:04.416
to avoid the unions.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.618
So what? Like lower pay, no
overtime, medical benefits...?

33:06.652 --> 33:08.387
That's right.

33:12.224 --> 33:15.561
But people still get hurt.

33:15.594 --> 33:18.230
And there'll
be hospital records.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.366
No, no, ma'am, you're not...

33:20.399 --> 33:22.168
Listen,
I said I'm only interested

33:22.201 --> 33:23.669
in patients without insurance.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.704
Thank you.

33:25.737 --> 33:27.673
Get anything from the ERs?

33:27.706 --> 33:29.541
Nope.

33:29.575 --> 33:32.144
A Julio Perez checked in
with swollen corneas.

33:32.178 --> 33:33.445
They see that with welders,

33:33.479 --> 33:34.480
especially
less experienced ones.

33:34.513 --> 33:35.314
No insurance.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.148
When was that?

33:36.182 --> 33:39.585
2:30 in the morning,
May 17th, 1999.

33:39.618 --> 33:42.054
Right, see, that's
when the Cole Center's

33:42.088 --> 33:43.422
foundation was being done.

33:43.455 --> 33:46.692
Immigration records shows
that he was

33:46.725 --> 33:49.628
deported back to Mexico
last year.

33:49.661 --> 33:50.596
Hold on-- Yeah?
Uh-huh.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.400
The hospital is saying that
somebody else paid his bill.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.302
Get a name.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.370
Can we get the name
of that person, please?

33:58.404 --> 34:00.739
DON: Sir, we're looking for
Keith Babbitt.

34:00.772 --> 34:03.409
We think he worked for you
on the Cole Center.

34:03.442 --> 34:04.243
Keith Babbitt?

34:04.276 --> 34:05.511
No, I don't know.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.346
He was a foreman
who specializes

34:07.379 --> 34:09.081
in foundation welding.

34:09.115 --> 34:12.118
He paid for a non-union
worker's hospital bill.

34:12.151 --> 34:14.653
I got hundreds of guys
on any one job.

34:14.686 --> 34:17.423
I don't know most of their names
until they screw up.

34:17.456 --> 34:18.624
Babbitt's union
records show

34:18.657 --> 34:21.527
he was unemployed for most of
'99, but his name shows up

34:21.560 --> 34:23.495
in relation to the Cole
Center foundation work.

34:23.529 --> 34:24.830
If you say so.

34:24.863 --> 34:26.498
Okay.

34:26.532 --> 34:29.301
It's the wrong move.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.537
Have a nice day.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.472
DON:
If Babbitt oversaw the crew

34:33.505 --> 34:35.207
that built
the Cole Center foundation,

34:35.241 --> 34:37.409
he might be the key to solving
the whole thing.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.178
David, why don't you
check out back?

34:39.211 --> 34:40.112
All right.

34:47.819 --> 34:49.555
( knocking on door )

34:49.588 --> 34:51.323
DON:
Mr. Babbitt?

34:51.357 --> 34:53.559
This is the FBI.

34:53.592 --> 34:57.296
( knocking )

34:57.329 --> 34:58.530
Mr. Babbitt?

35:00.732 --> 35:01.900
( engine running )

35:01.933 --> 35:03.669
Don! Back here!

35:07.506 --> 35:10.276
( coughing )

35:10.309 --> 35:12.911
He's unconscious.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.580
Pull him out, pull.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.782
( coughing )

35:21.220 --> 35:23.255
Paramedics are on the way.

35:23.289 --> 35:24.590
It's barely warm, so he couldn't
have been in there long.

35:24.623 --> 35:25.591
How's he doing?

35:25.624 --> 35:26.858
He's got a pulse.

35:26.892 --> 35:27.826
Mr. Babbitt?

35:27.859 --> 35:28.827
( coughing )

35:28.860 --> 35:30.229
It's all
right, FBI.

35:30.262 --> 35:31.230
You're gonna be fine.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.264
Don, look
at his head.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.166
Somebody
cold-cocked him

35:34.200 --> 35:35.601
then stuffed him
in that car.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.203
This is a staged suicide.

35:37.236 --> 35:38.837
Echoes of
Finn Montgomery.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.339
You okay?

35:40.372 --> 35:41.873
Yeah.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.275
You know who hit you?

35:43.309 --> 35:47.579
Uh, Nevelson's goon-- Mazzelli.

35:50.582 --> 35:51.817
DON:
Bob Mazzelli, FBI.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.719
You're under arrest.
Get your hands up.

35:53.752 --> 35:54.720
Put your hands up

35:54.753 --> 35:56.288
and get up
against the stall.

35:59.425 --> 36:00.326
You heard from
the hospital?

36:00.359 --> 36:01.227
Babbitt's agreed
to testify

36:01.260 --> 36:02.394
that Nevelson hired
his non-union crew

36:02.428 --> 36:05.397
to spot weld the foundation
points in the Cole Center.

36:05.431 --> 36:07.299
Now, that accounts for
the excessive deflection.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.334
Haybridge's design
called for

36:08.367 --> 36:09.501
full pen welds,
which are stronger

36:09.535 --> 36:11.237
and more stable,
but pen welds are also

36:11.270 --> 36:13.939
more expensive and more
time consuming than spot welds.

36:13.972 --> 36:16.775
That gives Building and Safety
grounds to evacuate.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.577
What about Finn--
can we tie this guy

36:18.610 --> 36:19.745
to his murder?

36:19.778 --> 36:21.313
TERRY: Technically we don't have
a murder.

36:21.347 --> 36:22.881
PD closed it out
as a suicide.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.816
There's no conclusive
forensic evidence.

36:24.850 --> 36:29.355
All right, well, that's
what confessions are for.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.364
Unless you're here
to take my lunch order,

36:38.397 --> 36:39.598
don't waste your time.

36:39.631 --> 36:42.701
Well, here's
the thing, Bob.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.403
See, you're not all lawyered up,

36:44.436 --> 36:46.438
so you know what that tells me?

36:46.472 --> 36:50.342
You want to know what I have.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.444
I'm thinking
ham on wheat,

36:52.478 --> 36:53.612
honey mustard, fries.

36:53.645 --> 36:57.449
You know what I have?

36:57.483 --> 37:00.319
I have you.

37:00.352 --> 37:02.321
I got you
for attempted murder

37:02.354 --> 37:04.356
of Keith Babbitt,
I got you for complicity

37:04.390 --> 37:06.992
in construction fraud,
which is a felony, by the way.

37:07.025 --> 37:09.361
You know what
I don't have?

37:09.395 --> 37:11.963
I don't have
any reason

37:11.997 --> 37:14.500
to keep this case open,
you know why?

37:14.533 --> 37:16.902
'Cause you're
the fall guy.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.871
And that's exactly what the
people who hired you wanted.

37:19.905 --> 37:22.474
What do you think
they're doing right now?

37:22.508 --> 37:23.442
They're planting evidence,

37:23.475 --> 37:24.943
they're opening
bank accounts in your name,

37:24.976 --> 37:25.811
they're making sure

37:25.844 --> 37:28.347
that you play
as the lone operator.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.581
What do you
think about that?

37:32.518 --> 37:33.585
Well, Bob, it's on you.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.454
You can make it worth my while

37:35.487 --> 37:37.323
to stay interested,
maybe cut you a deal,

37:37.356 --> 37:40.492
but you're going to have to tell
me who paid for the hits.

37:40.526 --> 37:42.461
Hits? Where'd the "S" come from?

37:42.494 --> 37:43.995
Finn Montgomery.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.364
Finn Mont...

37:45.397 --> 37:46.498
You mean that college kid?

37:46.532 --> 37:47.366
Yeah.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.067
Look, at worst,
they were talking about

37:49.100 --> 37:50.068
maybe buying him off.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.670
So what happened?

37:51.703 --> 37:53.539
You, uh, threw him off
a bridge instead.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.807
Well, I'm not saying it might
not have come to that,

37:55.841 --> 37:57.343
but he beat us to the punch.

37:58.710 --> 37:59.778
So it comes down to

37:59.811 --> 38:01.347
are you willing to take
the fall,

38:01.380 --> 38:04.350
or are you going to give
up who ordered the hit?

38:04.383 --> 38:07.453
All right,
get me a lawyer and the DA,

38:07.486 --> 38:09.621
something in writing.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.590
I'll give
you everything--

38:11.623 --> 38:12.591
except that kid.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.827
That is not on me.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.363
I'll see what
I can do, Bob.

38:19.465 --> 38:23.068
Hey, you know
he's lying to you, right?

38:23.101 --> 38:25.437
No, I'm not so sure
about that, Charlie.

38:25.471 --> 38:27.839
Get back in there, man.
Get on him.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.074
He's not telling
you the truth.

38:29.107 --> 38:31.042
Look, relax, all right?

38:31.076 --> 38:32.411
Just relax,
please.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.380
Finn Montgomery's suicide note.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.715
He mailed it to his parents
the night before his death.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.417
It took
this long to get forwarded

38:38.450 --> 38:39.551
to him in L.A.

38:39.585 --> 38:41.753
Were you were able
to authenticate it?

38:41.787 --> 38:43.455
Yeah, it's Finn's handwriting.

38:43.489 --> 38:44.656
It iterates all
the pressures--

38:44.690 --> 38:46.024
the girlfriend breaking
up with him,

38:46.057 --> 38:47.693
the thesis,
his inability

38:47.726 --> 38:49.895
to convince anybody
of the Cole Center's flaws.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.498
That doesn't make sense.
He was right about the building.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.533
In this circumstance,
being right might have been

38:54.566 --> 38:56.468
the crisis point that tipped
him to suicide.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.470
Looks like he thought this was
the only way to get anyone

38:58.504 --> 38:59.905
to take a serious
look at the Cole Center.

38:59.938 --> 39:03.542
Look, Charlie,
I'm sorry.

39:03.575 --> 39:06.778
I mean, he was smart,
but he was just a kid

39:06.812 --> 39:08.647
who wasn't strong
enough to deal with

39:08.680 --> 39:10.048
this period
in his life.

39:17.623 --> 39:19.691
Okay, now we deal with
the crimes that did occur.

39:19.725 --> 39:20.959
We've got fraud
and attempted murder.

39:20.992 --> 39:22.594
All right, well, call the DA.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.463
As soon as I get
Mazzelli to talk,

39:24.496 --> 39:26.665
we're going to find out
how high this thing goes,

39:26.698 --> 39:29.435
and I think it's all
the way up to Elliot Cole.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.443
How'd you know I was here?

39:37.476 --> 39:39.010
We didn't.

39:39.044 --> 39:39.778
Honey, who's there?

39:39.811 --> 39:40.378
FBI.

39:40.412 --> 39:41.713
You're
under arrest.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.083
Terry,
you got her?

39:45.116 --> 39:46.485
Yeah.

39:46.518 --> 39:49.621
Nevelson and Mazzelli
gave you up.

39:49.655 --> 39:50.989
"Gave you up?"

39:51.022 --> 39:52.624
- What for?
- Rachel and your contractor

39:52.658 --> 39:54.993
hired a non-union crew to do
the foundation welds.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.528
You paid full price.

39:56.562 --> 39:57.362
DON: They got $20 million

39:57.395 --> 39:59.030
and you got
a very unsafe building

39:59.064 --> 40:00.499
on your hands.

40:00.532 --> 40:01.399
I oversaw every detail

40:01.433 --> 40:03.502
of the construction
of that building.

40:03.535 --> 40:04.470
That include payment
authorizations,

40:04.503 --> 40:06.638
or did you rely on her
about what to sign?

40:06.672 --> 40:08.006
Come on,
let's go.

40:08.039 --> 40:10.476
We've been together three years.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.043
I gave you
this apartment,

40:12.077 --> 40:13.545
everything you asked for.

40:13.579 --> 40:14.813
I asked you
to divorce your wife.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.648
We discussed this.

40:16.682 --> 40:17.649
Oh, yeah,
the pre-nup.

40:17.683 --> 40:18.784
I have nothing
more to say.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.130
CHARLIE:
They will construct

40:32.163 --> 40:35.601
the tuned mass
damper on the roof.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.736
This is a scale model.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.738
On the real one, this
block of concrete

40:39.771 --> 40:41.673
will weigh about
300 tons or so,

40:41.707 --> 40:44.075
and it will rest on
a thin layer of oil.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.677
When wind pushes
the building,

40:45.711 --> 40:49.147
the block's inertia
will hold it in place,

40:49.180 --> 40:51.683
even as the building
slides under it.

40:51.717 --> 40:53.485
So the damper
acts as a counterweight

40:53.519 --> 40:54.953
to the movement of the building.

40:54.986 --> 40:57.022
It's amazing. So simple.

40:57.055 --> 41:00.225
Finn's insight will keep
a lot of people safe,

41:00.258 --> 41:02.728
so Elliot Cole
has agreed with me

41:02.761 --> 41:05.731
to dedicate
this structure in his name.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.669
You know, in Finn's letter,

41:10.702 --> 41:15.674
he said that part of
the reason that he...

41:15.707 --> 41:18.777
was that he felt nobody
understood him.

41:18.810 --> 41:22.748
He, uh,
he said he felt so alone.

41:22.781 --> 41:28.153
What we do... can certainly
be lonely sometimes.

41:28.186 --> 41:33.692
That's why it's so important
that you understood

41:33.725 --> 41:35.260
what he was
trying to accomplish.

41:35.293 --> 41:36.995
You spoke for our
son, Professor Eppes.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.096
There's
no way we can

41:38.129 --> 41:40.031
begin to thank you for that.

41:50.709 --> 41:52.911
So I am getting
right back on that horse.

41:52.944 --> 41:55.113
Not that this lady
is anything like a horse,

41:55.146 --> 41:56.882
she's really quite attractive.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.784
So it's not
a blind date?

41:58.817 --> 42:01.820
No, it's the butcher
that sold me the duck.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.623
- No!
- Yeah, she's very nice.

42:04.656 --> 42:06.257
And she really
knows her waterfowl.

42:06.291 --> 42:07.926
Right.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.562
Charlie. Charlie.

42:12.163 --> 42:15.601
This is not
the brilliant thought brood.

42:15.634 --> 42:16.735
This is the other brood.

42:16.768 --> 42:19.605
You all right,
Charlie?

42:19.638 --> 42:21.707
You knew it was a suicide.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.009
No, look, I said from
the get-go I didn't know,

42:24.042 --> 42:26.645
but I did suspect.

42:26.678 --> 42:29.715
Despite all the variables
and the inconclusive autopsy,

42:29.748 --> 42:31.282
and the layers of crime
that were uncovered?

42:31.316 --> 42:32.183
The fact that
the kid exhibited

42:32.217 --> 42:33.619
suicidal behavior
and then he did it.

42:33.652 --> 42:35.320
It's Occam's Razor, you know?

42:35.353 --> 42:37.689
I mean, the simplest answer
is usually the right one.

42:37.723 --> 42:39.090
Occam's Razor?

42:39.124 --> 42:40.859
DON:
What?

42:40.892 --> 42:42.728
I read a book
every now and then.

42:42.761 --> 42:44.596
Occam was a philosopher,
he wasn't a mathematician.

42:44.630 --> 42:45.797
And what he actually said

42:45.831 --> 42:47.198
was that you
shouldn't make

42:47.232 --> 42:48.233
more assumptions
than needed.

42:48.266 --> 42:50.802
It's the basis of
methodological reductionism.

42:50.836 --> 42:53.338
Any given data set, there
are an infinite number

42:53.371 --> 42:56.207
of possible hypothesis
and conclusions,

42:56.241 --> 42:56.307
an even great number
of infinite conclusions.
