The fatality was caused
by a massive skull fracture,

indicated by this depression
on the temporal lobe.

05:16.733 --> 05:20.300
She was bludgeoned,

05:20.366 --> 05:23.233
We found microscopic
wood fragments in the scalp,

05:23.300 --> 05:25.700

a wood handle--

- What are you telling me here?

06:07.466 --> 06:11.466
I'm telling you that this was
probably done by somebody who
knew her. It wasn't the Poet.

investigation any longer.

what you're saying--

07:52.766 --> 07:55.933
Did you ever see your daughter
with this Doctor Winslow?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.966
No.

And she never told you
she was having
a relationship with him?

08:01.933 --> 08:05.433
- Not at first.
- <i>But eventually?</i>

08:05.500 --> 08:07.733
I already told all this to him.
Do I have to--

08:07.800 --> 08:10.466
The problem is...

08:10.533 --> 08:13.733
we'd be getting our warrants

to be covered.

he was on the news.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.100

08:49.166 --> 08:53.733

invented this new heart valve,
and he was getting interviewed.

09:04.100 --> 09:07.200
she reluctantly admitted
that this was the guy.

09:08.700 --> 09:12.066
Why would you think
he played a part
in your daughter's death?

09:14.066 --> 09:17.600
Because two days ago,
she was scared.

having problems with the man
that she was seeing,

that he might hurt her.

make an arrest on that.

given you the punch line.

killed his victims.

what he was doing from you?

No. No, he was, uh,

his federal returns, didn't he?
-Yes, he did.

Did my client give you
a reason as to why he wouldn't
pay his state taxes?

10:35.933 --> 10:39.133
Well, he said when
his house caught on fire,
the fire department didn't come.

10:39.200 --> 10:43.833
And since he'd paid taxes for
fire protection and didn't get
it, he wasn't gonna pay anymore.

He greased up a pig--
more like a big, fat hog--

11:11.000 --> 11:15.366
and he wrote on it,
"Pay to the order of
the State Franchise Tax Board,"

11:15.433 --> 11:17.500
and he set it loose
in my office.

11:17.566 --> 11:23.266

"If the hog lays a big,
steamy bovine log, enjoy."

11:56.166 --> 11:58.033
[ Exhales ]
It's possible...

11:58.100 --> 12:02.700
that Jeffrey might become
a suspect in a rather
high-profile murder.

12:02.766 --> 12:04.633
There was a woman found dead,

12:04.700 --> 12:07.700

to be the victim
of a serial killer.

12:07.766 --> 12:09.966
But evidently now--
Let me stop you right there.

12:10.033 --> 12:14.400
In the spirit of small worlds,
I think I'm involved
with the D.A. heading that case.

12:14.466 --> 12:16.833
You think you're involved,
or you think she's the D.A.?

12:16.900 --> 12:20.600
Both. So we should probably
terminate this discussion.

12:20.666 --> 12:22.933
Yes. Well, we could do that.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.033
But, uh, if there is
conflict of interest,

district attorney to withdraw,
don't you think?

Well, it could be, but I--
I really don't want
to put her in that position.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.566

Well, does she feel strongly
about staying in it?

12:34.633 --> 12:36.100
I don't know.

12:36.166 --> 12:40.066
Well, I should think
that you would ask her
before declining our offer.

13:01.766 --> 13:05.100
I had nothing to do
with her death, Mr. Donnell.

13:06.066 --> 13:10.366
But I was having
an affair with her.

13:10.433 --> 13:14.033
I'm willing to pay a premium
to snuff out even the suspicion.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.600
I have a wife, a family,

13:16.666 --> 13:20.433
not to mention
I'm Chief Cardiothoracic Surgeon
at Mass General.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.200
I cannot have this affair
come to light.

13:25.333 --> 13:28.966
I'm prepared to hire
this entire firm...

13:29.033 --> 13:31.066
to see that doesn't happen.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.233
Well, this entire firm...

13:37.300 --> 13:40.466
would be expensive.
I know that.

13:42.200 --> 13:46.200
I'm ready to give you
a retainer for $1 million.

13:59.058 --> 14:01.024
You didn't tell me
about any pig.
Oh, grow up.

14:01.091 --> 14:04.791
Grow up? You assault them
with a greased pig
that just pops up in trial?

14:04.858 --> 14:07.291
- You don't think we should have
known about that?
- I didn't know.

14:07.358 --> 14:11.458
- What else do I need to know?
- Some law.
You know any law?

14:11.524 --> 14:13.724
Okay. That's it.
Can I take him for a second?
Keep him.

14:13.791 --> 14:15.691
Come on.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.058
I don't care
how mad you are.

14:20.124 --> 14:22.724
<i>You want to avoid jail,</i>
<i>you'd better care.</i>

14:22.791 --> 14:26.491
Now, right now,
that jury isn't laughing.
They don't like you.

14:26.558 --> 14:29.124
You have one chance
to make them like you,

14:29.191 --> 14:31.158
and if you screw that up,
it's prison.

14:32.858 --> 14:35.158
Uncle Ty,
are you listening to me?

14:36.658 --> 14:38.424
Prison.

14:40.658 --> 14:42.791
I hear you.

14:42.858 --> 14:48.424
I have a hard time askin' people
to feel sorry for me, Beck.
You know that.

14:49.624 --> 14:54.291
And I got a particular
hard time beggin' mercy on this.

14:55.791 --> 14:58.158
They let my place burn.

15:01.491 --> 15:03.558
I know.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.491
Who else would know
about this affair?

15:08.458 --> 15:12.158
Presumably nobody.
Cindy was discreet.

15:12.224 --> 15:15.324
Oh, I suppose
it's conceivable she--
she told somebody.

15:15.391 --> 15:18.124
There's an ex-husband
with psychological problems.

15:18.191 --> 15:20.058
If she had told him--
Could he have killed her?

15:20.124 --> 15:22.158
I don't know.

15:25.458 --> 15:29.358
- Have the police made
any contact?
- No. No.

15:29.424 --> 15:32.758
I thought I should go
and see them.

15:32.824 --> 15:34.858
That's when I decided
to see Jacob.

15:34.924 --> 15:37.358
- Yeah. And I'm not sure
that's a good idea.
- [ Sighs ]

15:37.424 --> 15:39.524
When's the last time
you saw her? Cindy.

15:39.591 --> 15:41.358
Uh, about a week ago.

15:41.424 --> 15:43.591
<i>Where?</i>
At her apartment.

15:43.658 --> 15:47.058
That was pretty much
the usual venue
for our relationship.

15:47.124 --> 15:49.724
Look, I'm sure
his fingerprints are there,

15:49.791 --> 15:53.124
and since he's
a hospital employee, the prints
are definitely on record.

15:53.191 --> 15:56.558
<i>The question is,</i>
<i>do we wait for</i>
<i>the police to seek us out,</i>

15:56.624 --> 16:00.291
or do we, in the spirit
of nothing to hide,
come forward?

16:00.358 --> 16:02.558
Well, the "nothing to hide"
spirit doesn't get you much.

16:02.624 --> 16:06.124
Uh, look, I-- I gotta
discuss this with
the members of my firm.

16:06.191 --> 16:08.658
- I gotta deal
with the conflicts.
- Okay.

16:08.724 --> 16:11.458
But we need
a quick decision.

16:11.524 --> 16:13.591
I understand.

16:15.091 --> 16:18.824
When I called 911,
it was just smoke.

16:18.891 --> 16:23.658
Three quarters of a mile--
that's the distance between my
apartment and that firehouse.

16:23.724 --> 16:27.524
- And the time you called?
- <i>Between 7:20 and 7:30.</i>

16:27.591 --> 16:30.724
- <i>And you're sure of this?</i>
- I'm positive.

16:30.791 --> 16:34.558
- I first smelled the smoke
during Final Jeopardy.
- Final Jeopardy?

16:34.624 --> 16:37.624
That's one of those
celebrity shows
they have during the sweeps.

16:37.691 --> 16:40.091
They had Ollie North on.

16:40.158 --> 16:42.491
That Bill Maher guy
kicked his ass.

16:42.558 --> 16:46.491
Uh, Mr. Emerson, what time
did the fire department
arrive at your house?

16:46.558 --> 16:48.891
Not till almost 8:15.

16:48.958 --> 16:52.058
By then
the whole place was ablaze.
They didn't come.

16:52.124 --> 16:53.758
Objection!
<i>They didn't come!</i>

16:53.824 --> 16:56.358
They let my place burn
'cause they didn't like
my neighborhood.

16:56.424 --> 16:59.324
- <i>Objection!</i>
- <i>[ Judge ] Sustained.</i>

16:59.391 --> 17:01.858
<i>Mr. Young,</i>
<i>please control your client.</i>

17:01.924 --> 17:05.590
Mr. Emerson,
control yourself.

17:11.458 --> 17:13.391

I'll letyou
give the performance.

17:13.458 --> 17:16.691
Oh, yeah,

Yes.

My name's Helen Gamble.
I'm from

This is
Detective Michael McKrew.
<i>Ma'am.</i>

17:27.023 --> 17:29.024
What's wrong?
[ Helen ]
Nothing, I think.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.258
We're terribly sorry
for bothering you.

17:31.324 --> 17:34.224
May we come in, please?
Uh, this will just
take a second.

17:34.291 --> 17:36.458
We don't need to.
It's embarrassing really.

17:36.524 --> 17:39.158
But, uh, there was a murder
the other night in Boston.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.891
It's reported to be the work
of a serial killer.

17:41.958 --> 17:43.958
I read about it.
<i>Yes, well--</i>

17:44.024 --> 17:45.891
well, you're not
gonna believe this,

17:45.958 --> 17:50.024
but somebody has identified you
as leaving the building
of the victim.

17:50.091 --> 17:52.158
[ Chuckles ]
What?

17:52.224 --> 17:54.758
- We're just checking it out,
that's all.
- Yeah.

17:54.824 --> 17:59.191
She, uh-- She came in with
this paper, pointing at you,
saying she saw you that night.

17:59.258 --> 18:02.858
That's ridiculous.
I didn't even
leave my house Tuesday.

18:02.924 --> 18:04.758
Well, we didn't put
much stock in it.

18:04.824 --> 18:08.624
It's just somebody else
saw a custard-blue Mercedes
driving in the vicinity,

18:08.691 --> 18:11.824
<i>and the coincidence.</i>
That's my husband's.

18:11.891 --> 18:15.591
He's a doctor. He works
at Mass General. He was probably
on his way to the hospital.

18:15.658 --> 18:18.991
Right, which is just
off Storrow Drive, sure.

18:19.058 --> 18:21.591
- He-- He went in that night?
- Yes. Yes.

18:21.658 --> 18:25.158
<i>Great. That explains it.</i>
<i>We're terribly sorry</i>
<i>for bothering you.</i>

18:25.224 --> 18:27.791
You know, do you remember...

18:27.858 --> 18:31.158
about the time your husband left
and the time he came back?

18:31.224 --> 18:35.624
If we can establish that
it was his car, we can rule out
this blue-car business.

18:35.691 --> 18:37.791
A call came in around 10:00.

18:37.858 --> 18:39.758
He was home by 1:00.

18:39.824 --> 18:43.691
Great. Thanks.
A-And, again, we're very sorry
for disturbing you.

18:46.591 --> 18:50.091
- <i>[ Door Closes ]</i>
- Lieutenant Columbo,
you missed your calling.

18:50.158 --> 18:51.991
Okay. We got him in the area
around the time.

18:52.058 --> 18:54.758
Oh, by the way,
if we'd gone in that house
as police agents--

18:54.824 --> 18:57.124
Yeah, I didn't
think about that. Yeah.
without warrants?

18:57.191 --> 18:59.124
All right.
She's probably calling him
as we speak.

18:59.191 --> 19:01.424
We'd better move.
Let's go, boys.

I think we got him, Mike.

19:27.424 --> 19:29.491
We gotta make him
take the plea.
Well, he won't.

19:29.558 --> 19:32.491
Talk to him.
Drive some sense into his head.
We've been talking to him.

19:32.558 --> 19:35.524
Why can't you
just do this, Eugene?

19:35.591 --> 19:38.024
He practically raised me.

19:40.124 --> 19:42.291
He was always there for me,
and he--

19:44.124 --> 19:46.258
That man,
more than anybody else,

19:46.324 --> 19:48.758
taught me how not
to sit back and take it.

19:48.824 --> 19:50.958
Not from anybody.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.224
Right now he needs me.

He needs you to help him
not to have to sit back
and take it.

Now all-- all that scum
we help every day--
why can't we just help him?

This Cindy Marks murder--
a potential suspect has
come to us for representation,

20:23.358 --> 20:25.558
and it would mean a lot
of money if we took it.

20:25.624 --> 20:28.091
- Against Helen?
- [ Sighs ]
Well, that's the conflict.

20:28.158 --> 20:30.091
My-- My gut says
turn it down.

20:30.158 --> 20:32.224
But when I say a lot of money--

20:32.291 --> 20:37.158
this guy is prepared
to plunk down
a $1 million retainer.

a million dollars?

20:45.624 --> 20:48.058

- Bobby, is this
even a question?

20:52.591 --> 20:54.324
Not everything's
about money, Ellenor.

If this is such a big conflict,
let Helen get off.

- Which we need, since Lindsay
dumped the drug clients.

tie these tissue samples to--

37:38.074 --> 37:39.141
What?
Dr. Jeffrey Winslow.

37:39.207 --> 37:40.774
She's on television.
What?

37:40.841 --> 37:44.374
His skin under her nails.
The D.N.A. evidence
is pretty conclusive.

37:44.441 --> 37:46.507
The good news is
we have this guy.
<i>[ Bobby Sighs ]</i>

37:46.574 --> 37:48.941
The bad news is
the Poet is still
out there.

37:49.007 --> 37:52.007
Of course, my office--
Let's get down there
and draft a protective order.

37:52.074 --> 37:55.541
We can write it
on the way.
I can't believe she did that.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.741
[ Bobby ]
It was a blatant attempt
to contaminate the jury pool.

37:57.807 --> 38:00.374
There's no gag order.
A reporter asked me a question--

38:00.441 --> 38:03.707
That is crap, Helen.
She's takin'
a circumstantial case and--

38:03.774 --> 38:06.774
You don't know the half
of my case, and if there's
some new rule that prohibits--

38:06.841 --> 38:09.107
potential members!
[ Judge Hiller ]
Hey! That'll do!

38:09.174 --> 38:13.107
This case is going to be enough
of an event without you two
trying to thicken the plot.

38:13.174 --> 38:15.474
I'll make this simple.

38:15.541 --> 38:19.874
Effective as of right now,
no talking to the media.

38:19.941 --> 38:22.307
That's that.
Anything else?

38:22.374 --> 38:24.374
Yes, Your Honor.
We'd like to view the scene.

38:24.441 --> 38:25.974
It's still a crime scene.
The investigation
is still ongoing--

38:26.041 --> 38:28.174
The investigation was
complete enough for you to go on
television pronouncing--

38:28.241 --> 38:32.074
That's got nothing to do
with whether or not you have
a right to go in there!

38:32.141 --> 38:36.807
- Quiet!
- As defense counsel, we have
a right to examine the scene.

38:36.874 --> 38:38.741
Supervised, I'll grant it.

38:38.807 --> 38:44.507
Now, let's go to chambers.
Just you and you.

38:53.474 --> 38:55.374
Are you crazy?

38:56.674 --> 39:01.341
It certainly is no secret
you two are sleeping together.

39:01.407 --> 39:04.807
Why in hell would you want
to invite the media...

39:04.874 --> 39:06.841
to pick you to pieces?

39:06.907 --> 39:10.674
Your Honor, I'd love to say
that my firm is financially
solvent enough to decline this,

39:10.741 --> 39:12.741
but it's not.

39:12.807 --> 39:14.907
[ Sighs ]
What about you?

39:14.974 --> 39:17.441
I don't want to get off.

39:17.507 --> 39:21.941
Well, I'm not going to force
either one of you off.

39:22.007 --> 39:25.774
<i>What I am going to do</i>
<i>is leave you alone</i>
<i>in this office...</i>

39:25.841 --> 39:31.074
in the hope that one of you
might be occasioned
to see straight.

39:31.141 --> 39:33.407
<i>Don't eat all my candy.</i>

39:36.541 --> 39:39.374
<i>[ Door Closes ]</i>
She's right.

39:40.641 --> 39:43.241
Of course she's right.

39:43.307 --> 39:45.307
But I'm not getting off.

39:47.374 --> 39:49.907
Why?

39:49.974 --> 39:52.007
Why?

39:52.074 --> 39:57.207
Because to do so, Bobby, would
be to prioritize my personal
life over my professional one,

39:57.274 --> 39:59.874
<i>which is okay.</i>

39:59.941 --> 40:02.674
<i>But as soon as</i>
<i>you made the decision</i>
<i>to get on this case,</i>

40:02.741 --> 40:05.674
you made it pretty clear
where you stand.

40:05.741 --> 40:08.774
Why should I prioritize us
when you don't?

40:08.841 --> 40:12.741
Well, I had
other people to think of
when I made that decision.

40:12.807 --> 40:17.041
Yes. I know
who you were thinking of
and who you weren't.

40:17.107 --> 40:19.507
So you're angry.

40:19.574 --> 40:22.274
Maybe I am.

40:25.141 --> 40:27.507
[ Sighs ]

40:29.941 --> 40:32.107
You're not
driving me off, Helen.

40:32.174 --> 40:34.374
And you're not driving me off.

40:36.274 --> 40:38.674
The only thing that's off,
it seems, is dinner.

40:45.707 --> 40:47.541
That the way
you want it?

40:50.374 --> 40:52.241
Yep.

40:56.574 --> 40:58.507
Fine.

41:00.941 --> 41:02.774
I'll see you in court.

41:57.974 --> 42:00.741
- Bobby.
- You okay?

42:08.574 --> 42:10.574
Maybe you should
recuse yourself.

42:10.641 --> 42:12.974
I know you took on this case
for the firm, but...

42:13.041 --> 42:15.007
you and Helen, and... this--

42:15.074 --> 42:18.574
I knew--
I knew the risks.

42:18.641 --> 42:21.407
Maybe Winslow would stay
with the firm even if
you weren't first chairing.

42:22.441 --> 42:25.541
Just distance yourself
a little.

42:25.607 --> 42:29.241
Are you really ready
to throw somebody you love
away for a case?

42:31.574 --> 42:33.507
Yes.

42:38.774 --> 42:41.374
I got this case because...

42:41.441 --> 42:45.841
somebody at a high-rise,
blue-chip law firm
recommended <i>me...</i>

42:45.907 --> 42:48.241
as the best.

42:49.207 --> 42:51.107
I've been practicin' law
in that--

42:51.174 --> 42:54.041
that rathole for 10 years,

42:54.107 --> 42:56.274
lookin' out the window,
seein' those--

42:56.341 --> 42:58.674
those lawyers
look down on me.

43:00.007 --> 43:02.641
And now,
one of them...

43:02.707 --> 43:06.774
came into <i>my</i> office
and said I'm the best.

43:08.507 --> 43:11.174
I like how
I got this case, Lindsay.

43:11.241 --> 43:14.407
I like that I'm gonna
try it in the media...

43:14.474 --> 43:17.507
and that I'm gonna
get paid a lot to do it.

43:19.141 --> 43:21.141
And I'm gonna win it.

43:25.841 --> 43:27.641
I'm gonna win it.

43:53.474 --> 43:55.241
