Rachel: He's alive.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.355
This is impossible.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.431
It's the nanotech
that did this, right?

00:15.520 --> 00:16.999
You're bounty hunters.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.315
Just put a bullet in his brain,
hand him in dead.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.515
They want him alive.

My name is

00:36.080 --> 00:38.117
- I want to help you.
- Is that so?

00:39.480 --> 00:41.437
- Guy's from a war clan.
- I'm Titus Andover.

any more of my kids either.</i>

00:52.440 --> 00:55.717
He saved me.
I owe him.

00:55.800 --> 00:56.835
Is he worth it?

01:18.160 --> 01:20.993
My wife Jessica.
She's diabetic.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.789
Went into renal failure
about two years ago.

01:24.880 --> 01:27.952
The filth in her blood
built up to toxic levels,

01:28.040 --> 01:30.873
no kidneys to filter it,
and we can't exactly just

01:30.920 --> 01:32.957
pop into St. Mary's
for dialysis.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.115
But the solution is simple.

01:38.240 --> 01:42.279
If her blood is poisoned,
we just replace it

01:42.320 --> 01:44.516
with fresh O-negative.

01:44.600 --> 01:48.036
Over and over and over

03:23.920 --> 03:24.910
You shouldn't have come.

stupider things for me.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.595

Can we get the hell
out of here, please?

03:54.200 --> 03:55.429
- You got to take that woman.
- Why?

03:55.480 --> 03:57.118
We can't move that woman.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.959
Trust me. You want Willoughby
to last through the night?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.274
Take her.

It's just a lot to take in.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.277
But you see what I mean, right?

08:18.320 --> 08:20.516
What happened to me
wasn't a miracle.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.471
It wasn't God
giving me a poke.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.473
You still don't know
why it happened, right?

08:30.600 --> 08:31.795

but someone or something

08:34.320 --> 08:36.596
told these machines
to save you.

They chose you.

- Alive, yeah.

Glad you are too.

09:50.080 --> 09:50.876

you hear me?

09:55.160 --> 09:56.514
Yeah.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.510
Who told you to go out there?

09:57.600 --> 10:00.353
They came out to save me, Riley.
And I appreciate the support.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.669
Hey, Stu.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.510
You don't let me treat
that hand, you're gonna lose it.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.079
Later.

10:37.960 --> 10:41.590
You son of a bitch.
You brought them here.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.830
You can't just hide
from a clan like this.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.754
Sooner or later,
they were gonna come for us.

10:47.840 --> 10:48.875
Granted, now it's sooner.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.071
Oh, great. Great.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.629
At least now we got
a chance at staying alive.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.318
Oh, yeah? How?

11:00.360 --> 11:02.829
Shut your slack jaw
and follow my lead.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.874
You have my wife!

11:31.000 --> 11:32.911
His wife?

11:34.360 --> 11:35.350
Yup.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.838
You send
any of your boy toys in,

11:39.880 --> 11:41.917
I will slit her throat.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.073
Still got one good hand left.

11:46.160 --> 11:49.994
You hurt her,
and I'm coming in.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.469
You come in,
and I will hurt her.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.750
So it looks like
we're at a stalemate.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.319
So what are we
gonna do about it?

11:59.360 --> 12:01.431
You and I are gonna
have a little chat

12:01.520 --> 12:03.193
about where to go from here.

12:03.240 --> 12:06.153
Not till I see that she's okay.

12:08.440 --> 12:09.635
She's in no shape to move.

12:09.720 --> 12:13.873
I need to see that she's okay!

12:16.280 --> 12:19.716
I need to know that she's okay.

12:24.480 --> 12:25.515
All right.

12:27.680 --> 12:28.750
I'll show her to you.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.554
Then we'll talk.

12:35.080 --> 12:39.233
And if you let her die,
then God help you!

12:52.800 --> 12:54.154
We need to talk.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.669
- Not now.
- Yes, now.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.358
- You need to calm down.
- Don't tell me--

13:06.400 --> 13:09.279
I said calm down.

13:10.760 --> 13:15.311
We are paying you to scare
this town, not gut them.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.394
Then our deal is off.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.917
I get it.
You're emotional.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.037
But you do not want to do that.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.794
You're gonna tell me
what to do.

13:26.840 --> 13:27.796
Who the hell are you?

13:27.840 --> 13:29.831
You know who we are.

13:29.880 --> 13:33.510
The US Government?
Please.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.074
You're just a bunch of plague
rats off some boat from Cuba.

13:36.160 --> 13:39.596
So keep your diamonds.
I don't care.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.875
I don't care what your sweaty,

13:40.880 --> 13:42.951
little plan is for this town either.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.514
All I want is my wife.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.671
Or else I bleed
those people alive.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.711
Each and every one.

13:51.640 --> 13:52.675
We clear?

14:17.640 --> 14:19.039
I can't let you kill him,
you know.

14:21.280 --> 14:24.033
Monroe murdered your partner,
like I said he would,

14:24.120 --> 14:25.997
and you still won't listen.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.872
You know, you're rocking
some real anger issues.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.798
You should wear
a black belly shirt.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.076
Do you take anything seriously?

14:33.120 --> 14:34.599
Nah, not really.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.278
It's how I stay sane.

14:39.080 --> 14:42.118
So this is personal, right?

14:42.160 --> 14:43.150
You and Monroe?

14:46.040 --> 14:47.997
He murdered half my family.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.190
So yeah, you might say that.

14:51.520 --> 14:55.195
I'm sorry to hear that.
I am.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.639
But I still can't
let you have him.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.714
All so you can
collect your bounty.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.270
So I can save my dad.

15:10.520 --> 15:11.999
The people who want Monroe,

15:12.040 --> 15:15.795
these United States
whoever they are...

15:16.960 --> 15:18.189
...they've got my dad.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.510
And I'm willing
to trade Monroe for him.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.269
Some trade.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.073
But I'm telling you...

15:29.080 --> 15:31.720
If you kill Monroe,

15:31.760 --> 15:33.671
it's the same
as killing my father.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.996
And that I take seriously.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.238
You sure you don't want
something for the pain?

15:55.320 --> 15:57.675
Not really the time
to get high, is it, Gene?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.792
Listen, if I can actually
pull this off,

16:02.840 --> 16:05.195
be ready, okay?

16:05.280 --> 16:06.190
Get everybody ready.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.679
Aren't you pretty much
the town drunk?

16:11.360 --> 16:12.919
We're just supposed to
listen to you?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.230
Who else, Riley? You?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.876
Anybody else feeling
the bold leadership

16:18.920 --> 16:20.149
of Barney Fife over here?

16:20.240 --> 16:23.153
Hey, do not call me that.
I'm not some idiot.

16:23.240 --> 16:25.072
Worked for this town
for a lot of years.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.270
YOU?

16:27.360 --> 16:28.839
You brought hell down on us.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.992
Your husband
just wants to see you.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.356
Make sure you're okay.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.471
Are you gonna
give me back to him?

16:47.560 --> 16:50.518
It'll all be over soon.
Don't worry.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.833
No, you don't understand.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.036
Don't let me go back there.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.195
Please.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.915
When I got sick, I thought...

17:06.079 --> 17:08.674
...well, this time,
I'm finally free.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.911
But even then,
he wouldn't let me go.

17:14.000 --> 17:14.990
He...

17:16.280 --> 17:18.839
He chained me to the bed.

17:18.920 --> 17:23.436
He killed people for me.

17:27.640 --> 17:31.190
He'll never let me go.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.231
I'm sorry.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.470
I'm not used to people
being nice.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.197
She's terrified of the guy,

18:04.280 --> 18:05.839
and we're gonna
make her go back?

18:08.120 --> 18:10.031
- I don't see another option.
- Miles.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.349
I can't fight like this.

18:12.960 --> 18:13.950
Can't use a sword.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.271
So,

18:19.320 --> 18:20.469
how else
am I gonna protect you?

18:37.520 --> 18:38.715
Hey, stay where you are.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.717
You pull anything,
we'll kill her.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.639
Love?
Are you all right?

18:48.400 --> 18:49.629
You'll be home soon.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.109
Miles: All right.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.673
You got your proof of life.

18:58.800 --> 18:59.995
She's gonna take a nap.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.719
You and I are gonna talk.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.350
That's enough of that.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.750
Hey. Give the man
his gun back.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.029
What?

19:48.120 --> 19:50.430
We're not being mugged.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.515
We're being vetted.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.193
Muggers don't take you
to a second location

19:54.240 --> 19:55.275
for a pat-down.

19:55.360 --> 20:00.116
Oh, and by the way,
your nails are too clean.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.832
So we gonna sit here and make
bedroom eyes at each other,

20:12.920 --> 20:15.309
or can I talk to your CO?

20:15.440 --> 20:16.839
Not bad, Mr. Crane.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.400
Didn't find anything.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.560
You can't blame us.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.070
After all, we want to know
everything we can about you.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.755
So why don't we start with,
who are you?

20:35.800 --> 20:38.076
Edgar Crane.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.438
And this is my son Nate.

20:44.520 --> 20:45.919
Oh, It's very interesting.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.870
Because I happen to know
that you're Major Tom Neville.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.473
And that is your son Jason.

20:58.960 --> 21:02.669
So I'm just
supposed to let everyone

21:02.760 --> 21:05.593
waltz right out of here,
unpunished?

21:05.640 --> 21:07.551
They didn't do anything
to your wife.

21:09.800 --> 21:10.915
I'm the one that took her.

21:12.440 --> 21:17.958
Jessica is fragile
and precious.

21:18.040 --> 21:23.035
Like a porcelain doll
on a high shelf.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.758
It's my job to protect her.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.359
It's always been my job.

21:29.760 --> 21:33.833
So how do I just let you go?

21:42.120 --> 21:43.758
Everyone in this town gets out.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.030
Everyone.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.429
And when they're safe...

21:53.200 --> 21:54.315
...you can have your wife back.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.395
And me.

22:00.440 --> 22:01.555
I'll stay behind.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.320
You can take
every ounce of my blood.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.959
You can milk me dry, tiger.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.670
Oh, Jessica.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.674
I'm sorry.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.235
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.431
Dad!

22:26.520 --> 22:27.669
Jessica.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.478
I had to get away.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.471
- Jessica, stay with me.
- I had to get away.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.635

or I poke them out.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.560
You're gonna want to see this.

23:27.720 --> 23:29.313
I was looking for a weapon.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.995
And I found this.

23:38.920 --> 23:39.910
Yeah?

23:47.120 --> 23:48.633
I also found this.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.678

let that happen?

Okay? So tell no one.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.354

everything's fine.

once in a while.

Major Tom Neville
of the Monroe militia.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.754
An enemy combatant.

27:45.840 --> 27:49.071
By all rights
we should execute you.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.913
If you know all about me,
then you know...

27:53.680 --> 27:56.911
...that I was forcibly discharged
from that organization.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.673
Look, I get it.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.034
I should've told you who I was.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.271
But all I wanted was to help.

28:06.320 --> 28:13.431
What you are is disloyal
and conniving.

you want to help us?

I don't care about you.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.676
I don't care
about the United States.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.952

28:29.040 --> 28:31.873
Then why are you here?

28:31.960 --> 28:35.874
Because I know
who dropped those bombs.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.031
I know who killed my wife.

28:41.800 --> 28:44.918
Sebastian Monroe did.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.399
Who else could it be?

28:48.200 --> 28:51.113
And I want revenge.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.592
Every night I picture
the same thing.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.119
My wife.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.559
She looks up.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.314
Hears the blast.

29:12.360 --> 29:16.991
As the glass shatters.

29:18.640 --> 29:21.758
And as she bursts into flame.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.632
I wonder.

29:28.240 --> 29:29.275
Did she feel it?

29:31.920 --> 29:35.800
It was my job to protect her.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.871
I want Monroe to pay.

29:43.520 --> 29:48.390
I need him to pay.

29:52.760 --> 29:54.239
I want to help you find him.

Yes.

if you're lying, Major.

with your unique skills

try to hurt us--

have a problem with it.

about that one?
