WEBVTT

00:03.200 --> 00:06.600
So if"x" equals seven,
then "y" equals-

00:06.500 --> 00:09.600
- Two?
- Wrong. Kelso?

00:09.500 --> 00:11.500
Uh...

00:11.400 --> 00:13.500
"L"?

00:14.700 --> 00:17.400
Also wrong.
It's a pretty simple equation, guys.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.200
Just think about it
for a second.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.700
You're so pretty.

00:23.700 --> 00:26.700
You don't even need
to know math.

00:26.700 --> 00:30.600
That's so weird.
I was just thinking the same thing.

00:30.400 --> 00:34.800
Steven, you're so pretty
you don't need to know nothin'.

00:34.700 --> 00:39.000
- That's good, 'cause I'm stupid.
- [Blows Raspberry]

00:38.900 --> 00:41.600
Oh, real mature, guys.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.800
[Panting]

00:46.900 --> 00:50.000
- Fez, what happened?
- I was walking back from the pep rally...

00:50.000 --> 00:53.400
flush with school spirit...

00:53.400 --> 00:57.300
when-when-when some boys
from Fort Anderson, they jumped me...

00:57.200 --> 01:00.100
and they slapped me,
and they beat me-

01:00.000 --> 01:04.099
And look at what they did
to my pom-poms.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.200
[Laughing]

01:07.200 --> 01:09.500
Hey, that's not funny, man.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.800
It's really not.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.200
They spray painted me
on my ass.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.000
[Both Laughing]

01:17.900 --> 01:22.800
I want revenge against those
Fort Anderson Snapping Turtles.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.600
Look, Fez,
I'll tell you what.

01:24.500 --> 01:27.100
Let's go to the garage,
and I'll get you some paint thinner.

01:27.100 --> 01:30.000
- Ay, no.
- I'm sorry, Fez. It has to be done.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.400
Yeah, and the three of us
have to watch.

01:33.300 --> 01:36.800
Fine. But this time,
no smoking.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.400
Great. Now maybe
we can get some work done.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.400
[Sighs]
Michael's so sweet.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.400
Uh-oh.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.400
- He's just so-
- No!

01:47.400 --> 01:50.500
- Do you think that Michael and l-
- Don't even say it, Jackie.

01:50.300 --> 01:53.800
- I think maybe-
- I'll kill myself, I swear to God.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.800
He and I should get
back together.

01:55.700 --> 01:59.700
Jackie, do you remember
how Kelso cheated...

01:59.600 --> 02:03.000
and hurt you
and lied to you?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.900
Listen to yourself, Donna.

02:04.900 --> 02:09.000
"Cheat-ed." "Hurt-ed."
"Lie-duh."

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
It's all ancient history.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.800
But when we look
into each other's eyes...

02:14.700 --> 02:16.900
I know we're both thinking
about the same thing.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.500
Your hair?

02:19.500 --> 02:22.800
No. That we're meant
to be together.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.700
Look, I need to know
that he's really changed.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.900
I need to test him
somehow.

02:26.900 --> 02:28.800
- I agree.
- You do?

02:28.800 --> 02:32.100
Absolutely. If you get back with Kelso,
you better have him tested.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.100
Hangin'out

02:39.500 --> 02:41.500
Down the street

02:43.100 --> 02:45.100
The same old thing

02:46.800 --> 02:48.700
We did last week

02:49.800 --> 02:54.300
Not a thing to do

02:54.200 --> 02:57.600
But talk to you

02:57.500 --> 02:59.300
We're all all right

02:59.200 --> 03:01.100
We're all all right

03:01.100 --> 03:03.500
Hello, Wisconsin.!

03:11.900 --> 03:14.200
Okay. I want to see
if Michael is ready...

03:14.200 --> 03:16.500
to be in a healthy,
adult relationship...

03:16.400 --> 03:19.400
so I've come up
with five psychological tests.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.100
Damn, Jackie.
He can't even spell "psychological."

03:22.900 --> 03:26.200
Look, besides, he only has
to get three out of five.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.000
And the first test
is on maturity.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.200
Oh, man.

03:33.100 --> 03:36.600
So we're trying to get the paint
off of Fez's butt, right?

03:36.500 --> 03:39.500
So I started to spray
lighter fluid on it.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.100
And Fez gets all mad, right?

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
And then he started chasing me,
but he had his Pants around his ankles.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.300
So then he tripped and fell,
and I think he hurt himself...

03:48.200 --> 03:50.700
but I don't know, 'cause I was,
like, out of there.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.600
So what's going on
with you guys?

03:53.600 --> 03:55.600
Donna and I were discussing
our careers.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.700
I'm going to high-end cosmetics...

03:57.700 --> 04:01.000
and Donna thinks she'll make
a great lumberjack.

04:05.900 --> 04:09.400
Stop telling everybody that.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.100
So what kind of career
do you see yourself in?

04:12.100 --> 04:15.700
Okay, well, I was considering
becoming a doctor.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.500
Ooh. A doctor?
That's so mature.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.899
Or... a rodeo clown.

04:25.700 --> 04:29.500
Rodeo clown?
You want to be a rodeo clown. Why?

04:29.500 --> 04:33.100
Rodeo clowns are the unsung
heroes of the new West.

04:32.900 --> 04:36.300
And you know I've always
enjoyed being inside of barrels.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.000
Cheese puffs!
Ow!

04:44.000 --> 04:45.900
Well, see,
they're not for you.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.500
They're for Bob and Midge's party.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.600
Oh. Bob and Midge
are having a party?

04:50.600 --> 04:52.500
Well, I can't go.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.400
I'm very, uh...

04:54.400 --> 04:56.300
busy.

04:56.300 --> 04:59.100
Oh, wait.
Bob didn't invite you?

04:59.000 --> 05:02.600
No, but thanks for the heads-up.
I'll be sure to avoid them.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.500
Huh. Midge didn't
invite me either.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.300
But I'm sure
they're having a party.

05:07.300 --> 05:10.900
I saw them bring a keg
and a lot of chairs into the house.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.100
Well, you don't know
that they're having a party.

05:13.100 --> 05:18.400
Bob's out of work. The two of them
might be starting some weirdo church.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.100
You know, the kind of church
where you, uh...

05:24.100 --> 05:27.000
sit around on chairs
and drink beer.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.500
I'm sure Midge will be over
any minute-

05:30.500 --> 05:33.900
the last minute, like always,
to invite us.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.700
I tell ya.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.900
I like the sound
of a beer church.

05:43.700 --> 05:46.900
Hi, neighbor.
I have something I want to ask you.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.700
- Oh, really?
- Can I borrow your big punch bowl?

05:49.600 --> 05:51.600
A big punch bowl?

05:51.600 --> 05:53.600
Oh, my, what would that be for?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.900
Uh-oh.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.800
I should have
thought this through.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.300
You know, forget about it.
I'm gonna get someone else to bring it.

06:02.300 --> 06:05.800
[Gasps]
And by "someone else," I mean Bob.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.700
Midge, l-

06:07.700 --> 06:09.700
I already made
your cheese puffs.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.600
Ooh, thanks.
[Sniffs] Mmm!

06:12.600 --> 06:16.500
Boy, all these cheese puffs
are really gonna come in handy.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.100
'Cause Bob's so hungry.

06:19.100 --> 06:22.000
We're not having a party.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.100
Okay, this next test
is about consideration.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.600
I want to see if he'll choose
my interests over his.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.800
This is gonna be so funny.

06:37.100 --> 06:40.700
- Grape.
- So Michael-

06:40.600 --> 06:42.700
There are two events
occurring this weekend.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.600
One that you might like...

06:44.500 --> 06:47.100
and one that I would really,
really, really...

06:47.100 --> 06:49.000
really want to go to.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.000
Now, should we go see
the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders-

06:54.000 --> 06:56.500
[Scoffs]
Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.

06:56.400 --> 07:00.600
- Yes, or-
- No. Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.

07:00.600 --> 07:06.000
- But Michael, I want-
- No. Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders!

07:07.300 --> 07:09.800
See? Funny.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.300
Kelso, what are you doing?

07:19.300 --> 07:21.200
We're just tossing
around this egg...

07:21.200 --> 07:23.300
Jackie gave me
to take care of.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.300
Don't you think
it might break?

07:29.200 --> 07:31.600
Yeah, uh, well,
we just thought...

07:31.600 --> 07:34.800
we'd have some fun with it
before I threw it at somebody.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.700
You are such a moron.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.600
- You are so gonna failJackie's test.
- [Chuckles]

07:38.600 --> 07:41.300
Test? What test?

07:41.300 --> 07:43.400
I'm not supposed to say anything,
butJackie's testing you...

07:43.300 --> 07:45.300
to see if you're ready
to get back together.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.200
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

07:48.600 --> 07:51.600
- Do you think I have a chance?
- Not a good one.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.000
You've already failed two tests
and you're about to fail the third.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.300
That egg is a test
of your parenting ability.

08:01.700 --> 08:04.500
So what you're saying is
if I break that egg...

08:04.400 --> 08:06.800
then I fail the test,
and loseJackie...

08:06.800 --> 08:10.400
the girl I love more
than anything in the world?

08:11.900 --> 08:14.800
- Hyde, give me the egg.
- Okay, catch.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:32.600 --> 08:34.900
Whoops.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.200
I mean-
[Cackles]

08:50.400 --> 08:52.500
Okay, you guys...

08:52.500 --> 08:54.400
let's do this for Fez.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.000
Finally my butt cheeks
will be avenged.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
VoilÃ .

09:13.700 --> 09:17.000
Guys, I feel like we
accomplished something today.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.800
I feel like
we made a difference.

09:19.700 --> 09:24.200
Oh, I'm not done yet.
Taste my wrath, Snapping Turtles.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.100
[Clattering]

09:37.200 --> 09:39.100
That was a close one.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.700
[Loud Click]

09:41.700 --> 09:43.600
[Groans]

09:43.600 --> 09:46.000
Crap! The janitor
locked us in.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.600
Yep. No good deed
goes unpunished.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.800
Oh, my God.
How could this get any worse?

09:52.800 --> 09:55.000
[Panting]
Okay, guys...

09:55.000 --> 09:58.800
we have 20 seconds until
the cherry bomb in the toilet goes off.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.000
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.700
- What's that?
- Oh, it's just this little...

10:26.500 --> 10:29.500
crib-like thing
I made for Eggy.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.100
- Eggy?
- Yeah, I named him.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.300
I don't know, this egg is,
like, bringing out...

10:40.300 --> 10:42.900
all the parental stuff in me.

10:42.900 --> 10:46.700
Michael, what happened to the pencil mark
I made on the bottom?

10:47.500 --> 10:49.500
Oh.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.600
Must have come off when I was
giving him his gentle bath.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.400
Nice.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.400
Michael, I knew
you had this in you.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.500
- You are gonna make a great dad one day.
- Yeah.

11:02.400 --> 11:06.300
Uh-oh.
Somebody needs a change.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.400
[TV]

11:14.800 --> 11:16.900
Oh, I just can't believe
Midge would do this...

11:16.900 --> 11:19.200
after all the years
we've been friends.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.900
She took
the cheese puffs.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.300
All the cheese puffs?

11:25.300 --> 11:28.800
What the hell?
I wanted some of those.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.600
Red, this isn't
about the cheese puffs.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.700
Well, maybe not for you.

11:34.700 --> 11:37.600
They're so light and fluffy.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.800
- This is all your fault.
- What?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.700
You're always mean to them.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.600
Now you've driven them away.
I hope you're happy.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.100
Actually, Kitty, I am happy.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Them not inviting us
to the party...

11:47.900 --> 11:50.700
is not the end of the world.

11:50.700 --> 11:55.800
In fact, it's the start
of a beautiful new world-

11:55.500 --> 12:00.400
a world where we don't
get invited to the Pinciottis'.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.900
There's no talking to you.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.700
You're just sour.

12:05.600 --> 12:10.200
You're an old,
sour crab apple.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.900
Why are you yelling at me?

12:13.900 --> 12:16.900
I'm not the one that didn't
invite you to a party.

12:16.800 --> 12:21.400
If you've got something to say,
you say it to the Pinciottis.

12:21.300 --> 12:26.400
Well, you talked me
into it, Red Forman. Let's go.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.700
Oh, no.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.300
Look at us-

12:32.200 --> 12:34.700
locked in a locker room.

12:34.700 --> 12:39.100
Oh, the irony
is not lost on me.

12:38.900 --> 12:42.300
- [Toilet Flushes]
- Why do you mock us, Fate?

12:43.600 --> 12:46.600
Okay, you guys, we gotta think
about a way to get out of here.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.200
Okay, guys, I've just gone through every
escape-from-prison movie...

12:49.200 --> 12:51.900
- I could think of, and I came up with something.
- What?

12:51.800 --> 12:55.500
Steve McQueen
is a total bad-ass.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.900
Okay, thanks, Hyde.
That's not helping.

12:58.800 --> 13:02.400
If we don't get out of here, a bunch of jocks
are gonna come in here and kick our asses.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.800
Why did I put a cherry bomb
in the toilet?

13:04.800 --> 13:08.600
It doesn't smell
like cherries at all.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.700
Come on, guys, think.

13:10.600 --> 13:14.500
Yeah, yeah. Right.
Gotta be something we can do.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.100
I got it.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.700
[Groans]

13:24.700 --> 13:27.600
[Chuckling]

13:27.500 --> 13:30.100
Much better.

13:30.100 --> 13:34.500
Yeah. Now instead of feeling
scared and anxious...

13:34.300 --> 13:37.000
I feel relaxed and...

13:38.300 --> 13:40.600
relaxed.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.800
I know we're probably
gonna get beaten...

13:42.800 --> 13:44.700
but it was worth it
because we've shown...

13:44.700 --> 13:47.600
we have tremendous
school spirit.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.000
[Weeping]

13:56.200 --> 13:59.000
Go Vikings.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.900
School spirit
is for losers, man.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.800
You're just, like,
floating along...

14:05.800 --> 14:08.100
on a conveyor belt
of conformity.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.800
Pep rallies,
extracurricular activities...

14:10.800 --> 14:14.000
washing your hair-

14:13.900 --> 14:16.800
It's all just a trap, man.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.700
Yeah, Fez. It's one thing to root
for a football team...

14:20.600 --> 14:22.500
but to confuse
the Point Place Vikings...

14:22.500 --> 14:25.900
with a sense of personal
identity, that's just-

14:25.900 --> 14:27.800
relaxing.

14:30.300 --> 14:33.200
We're all gonna die tomorrow.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.600
Michael,
I have some bad news.

14:45.600 --> 14:49.800
- I just found out I have B.H.D.
- B.H.D.?

14:49.700 --> 14:52.900
Yeah. Brittle Hair Disease.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.600
I have to go
to the hospital tomorrow...

14:56.700 --> 14:58.600
and get all my hair
shaved off.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.900
- So you'll be-
- Bald, Michael.

15:02.900 --> 15:07.000
B-A-L-D, no hair,
shiny head, bald.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.000
And my hair won't
ever grow back either.

15:08.900 --> 15:12.500
Will you still love me
when I'm bald?

15:14.200 --> 15:16.900
You could wear a wig.

15:16.700 --> 15:19.900
So, Michael, are you saying
that you would not love me...

15:19.900 --> 15:22.800
if I didn't have a luscious,
full-bodied head of hair?

15:26.100 --> 15:28.100
Oh!

15:29.900 --> 15:31.800
No, Jackie.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.500
I would love you even more.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.400
You know, I would shave off
my hair...

15:36.300 --> 15:38.300
and paste it to your head.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.900
Michael, that's beautiful.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.800
Nice job.

15:52.700 --> 15:55.500
Thanks.
That was a test, right?

15:55.400 --> 15:58.900
'Cause bald chicks are gross.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.500
Look at that.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.200
They closed the blinds,
so we couldn't see the party.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.300
- But I can hear them.
- [Music Playing, PeoPle Talking]

16:09.300 --> 16:13.800
I can hear you, Bob and Midge!
I can hear your party!

16:15.500 --> 16:18.100
Ooh. Kitty and Red.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.600
We've very busy in here.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.700
Yes, we're very busy.
We'll talk tomorrow.

16:23.700 --> 16:27.300
You're having a party,
and you didn't invite us.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.200
And I thought we were friends,
and we're not.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.100
And I'll tell you
something else.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.600
You're naked.

16:37.600 --> 16:41.300
You have no clothes on.
Why don't you have any clothes on?

16:41.300 --> 16:45.100
Well, we're having a nudist party
with our fellow nudists.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.300
We're, uh, nudists.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.400
And we're not.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.100
So, you didn't invite us.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.900
So, thank you.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.200
Come on, Red.
Let's go.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Kitty.
What are you saying?

17:07.700 --> 17:10.500
You really wanted
to attend this party.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.200
- Stop it, Red.
- No, no, no, no.

17:13.099 --> 17:17.700
Now get in there and have yourself
a good old naked time, huh?

17:17.599 --> 17:19.900
Who knows?
They might play Twister. Could be fun.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.900
Okay, guys,
they can't be mad at us now.

17:35.700 --> 17:39.200
Yeah, Fez, I don't think
that's gonna help.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.500
- [FootstePs]
- All right, here they come.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.500
Okay, you guys, here's the plan.
Fez, you beg for mercy in broken English.

17:45.300 --> 17:47.800
Hyde, you insist that this whole thing
was a big setup.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.500
And I'll just curl up in the fetal position
and think about pancakes.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.700
- Got it.
- Got it.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.800
Oh, my God.
We're in the girls' locker room.

17:59.700 --> 18:03.300
Yeah. They're girls.

18:03.200 --> 18:07.600
Phew! And I thought we were
going to get beaten up for sure.

18:10.700 --> 18:13.400
Hey, baby.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.300
- Hi, Kelso.
- Hi, Tiffany.

18:27.300 --> 18:31.100
I'm so glad I ran into you.
I've been meaning to ask you something.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.600
- Yeah? What's that?
- Will you take me back to your house
and make out with me?

18:36.900 --> 18:38.900
Well, l-
[Chuckles]

18:38.900 --> 18:41.700
I don't know.
Yeah, I'm here to meetJackie, so-

18:41.700 --> 18:44.600
I promise she'll never find out.

18:44.500 --> 18:48.100
It'd be an afternoon
of secret make-out fun.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
You can drink grape juice
from my belly button.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.800
[Thinking] All right, this has
got to be one ofJackie's tests.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.600
I mean, Tiffany
never comes on to me.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.800
But what if it's not?

18:59.800 --> 19:03.000
I mean, let's face it,
I look good today.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.600
That new conditioner's
really working out.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.800
All right, but the real question is,
should I risk it?

19:08.700 --> 19:12.800
And my body says yes,
and my head says yes...

19:12.700 --> 19:15.600
but my heart says no.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.600
Aw, my stupid heart's right.

19:18.500 --> 19:22.100
I can't. I mean, I appreciate
the offer and all...

19:22.000 --> 19:24.700
'cause you're, like,
really hot...

19:24.700 --> 19:30.500
but the only girl I want to make out with
is Jackie, so-

19:30.200 --> 19:33.100
Oh, Michael, you did it! You did it!
You passed the last test!

19:33.000 --> 19:36.100
- Did you believe me, Michael?
- Yeah, sure.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.300
Oh, good, because
I'm in drama club, and I really want-

19:38.200 --> 19:40.600
Yeah, thank you, Tiffany, bye-bye.
[Squealing]

19:40.600 --> 19:45.300
Michael, now I know I can
honestly trust you with all my heart.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.300
Ooh!

19:47.300 --> 19:49.300
Um-

19:49.300 --> 19:51.900
Jackie...

19:51.900 --> 19:54.500
Donna told me about the test.

19:54.300 --> 19:58.800
So I knew what was going on,
and I didn't say anything.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.900
So maybe I don't deserve
to be with you...

20:00.900 --> 20:04.100
because that wasn't
very honest of me.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.400
But telling me that was.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.100
Damn.

20:10.100 --> 20:13.700
You're right.
So you'll take me back?

20:13.700 --> 20:15.700
Yeah, Michael.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.600
I love you, Jackie Burkhart.

20:22.600 --> 20:26.300
I love you too, Michael Kelso.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.200
What the hell happened
to you guys?

20:49.200 --> 20:51.700
We got beaten up.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.700
By men.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.000
By big, strong men.

20:57.500 --> 21:01.000
Hey, guys,
as I was getting beaten...

21:00.800 --> 21:03.000
I think I got
to second base.
