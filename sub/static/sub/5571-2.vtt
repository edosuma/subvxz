WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:05.304
Agent Gibbs?

00:05.306 --> 00:07.439
(Crowd clamoring)
Aah!

00:07.441 --> 00:09.575
NCIS agent with two gsws!

00:09.577 --> 00:11.010
One to the chest,
one to the knee.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.778
Let's put him under
and crack him.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.013
10cc's of epi.
He's crashing.

00:14.015 --> 00:14.680
Might have to shock him.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.181
<i> You spend too much time</i>

00:16.183 --> 00:17.349
thinking about the past.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.351
<i> It's about the future now.</i>

00:19.353 --> 00:21.553
<i>Bad people are still out there.</i>

00:21.555 --> 00:24.223
Teague:
<i> Rule 45-- what's that?</i>

00:24.225 --> 00:26.025
Clean up your own mess.

00:26.027 --> 00:29.094
(Grunting)

00:29.096 --> 00:31.463
You know, everybody watching me,

00:31.465 --> 00:33.465
afraid I'm gonna break.
Are you?

00:33.467 --> 00:35.100
I hurt.

00:35.102 --> 00:36.635
Pain didn't go away.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.070
Can't do it alone.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.471
I've met your team.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.606
Who says you're alone?

00:40.608 --> 00:42.241
Do we need to talk?

00:51.218 --> 00:53.285
It's remarkable.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.653
I can't look away.

00:54.655 --> 00:58.090
I mean, think about it.
25 years of dedication,

00:58.092 --> 01:00.192
and cold Turkey--
he gives up the Polo shirts.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.627
Factor in the new hair--

01:01.629 --> 01:03.695
it's the makeover
of the century.

01:03.697 --> 01:06.432
No, there's no way around it.
This man looks spectacular.

01:06.434 --> 01:09.468
And can we take a minute to just
talk about the new attitude?

01:09.470 --> 01:11.703
Right, it's like you can't quite
put your finger on it, right?

01:11.705 --> 01:13.672
I want to say
he's even more focused.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.809
Yes, yes-- it's like
he was laser focused before,

01:16.811 --> 01:19.678
but now he's got the whole
<i> real genius</i> atomic laser now.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.448
I'm not quite sure
what he's focused<i> on,</i> though.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.516
Really, people?

01:24.518 --> 01:25.651
Oh, come on, Tony.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.286
You haven't noticed
a change in Gibbs

01:27.288 --> 01:29.321
since he got back from Iraq?
Of course I have.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.390
But I don't feel
the need to analyze it

01:31.392 --> 01:33.725
like some science project
behind his back.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.161
We always analyze Gibbs
behind his back.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.729
Take the pictures down, Tim.
It's rude.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.731
Okay, no reason
to get snippy about it.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.535
Look, he got shot.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.670
He came back.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.605
He's different.
Who wouldn't be?

01:46.607 --> 01:48.440
Physically, he's still
got to be in a lot of pain.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.442
I talked to him
yesterday about it.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.611
I told him whatever he needs.
And he listened to you?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.413
Well, he did that thing
where he acts like he's busy,

01:54.415 --> 01:56.415
his finger sort of wobbles
over the shift key

01:56.417 --> 01:57.716
and he's not really
doing anything,

01:57.718 --> 01:58.884
so I think he got the gist.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.153
DiNozzo, what are you doing?

02:01.155 --> 02:02.521
Oh, boss, I just...

02:02.523 --> 02:04.756
The, uh...
(Chuckles)

02:04.758 --> 02:08.260
They were sort of comparing
your-your hairstyle...

02:08.262 --> 02:10.696
It wasn't really about the hair.
It was more...

02:11.832 --> 02:13.165
Who are you?

02:13.167 --> 02:14.800
Mitch, DEA, San Diego.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.170
Need your help bringing in
a wayward marine.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.439
Now, I have all the pertinent
material on here--

02:20.441 --> 02:21.640
photos and whatnot.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.840
I believe you're the one
to help me display those.

02:22.843 --> 02:23.842
Am I right?

02:23.844 --> 02:25.644
Uh, sure, yeah.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.646
Thanks, buddy.
Appreciate it.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.715
Is this room okay for briefing?

02:29.717 --> 02:31.283
Yeah, but you want
something more secure,

02:31.285 --> 02:32.918
we can get that.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.155
The marine in question
is sergeant Cole gleason.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.322
25 years old.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.924
Small arms repair technician

02:38.926 --> 02:40.826
in the middle
of his three-week leave.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.194
Says he has
some kind of evidence

02:42.196 --> 02:43.595
on a bad guy I've been chasing.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.397
But he keeps waffling
about turning it over.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.932
We had a meet
set for last night.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.267
He stood me up.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.535
Cold feet.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.937
Next slide
if you don't mind.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.740
The aforementioned
bad guy-- Benson long.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.276
My very own drug-running
Moby dick.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.178
Now, Benson spent
half his life in California

02:59.180 --> 03:00.579
distributing
dope of every flavor.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.614
Three weeks ago,
i tracked him to DC.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.849
Got a little too close
to him back home,

03:03.851 --> 03:05.918
so now he's opening up
an east coast branch.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.554
So I guess I'll just keep going
with these pictures here, then?

03:08.556 --> 03:12.257
Thanks, buddy.
That'd be lovely.

03:12.259 --> 03:14.393
This is long.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.628
Out and about
in your neighborhood.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.763
It's near Quantico.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.264
He recruits military.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.832
Military's
all over it internally.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.301
Our troops are trained
to be the best of the best.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.586
Cartels know it.

03:23.587 --> 03:24.870
They lure our guys
with big paydays.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.905
That or fear tactics.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.640
Now, I've seen
long employ both.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.843
And sergeant gleason
is one of his new recruits.

03:31.845 --> 03:35.647
So new, in fact, I think I have
a better shot at turning him

03:35.649 --> 03:37.516
than anyone
I've ever approached before.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.785
So, you want to force gleason
to turn over his evidence?

03:39.787 --> 03:41.954
What's the play?
Poor money management.

03:41.956 --> 03:44.556
Gibbs found that there
was a case recently opened

03:44.558 --> 03:46.258
on the sergeant for writing
bad checks on base.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.527
You're gonna arrest him
and turn him against long.

03:48.529 --> 03:49.995
Leverage can do that sometimes.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.464
Boss?
Where do we pick up gleason?

03:52.466 --> 03:53.865
He's been giving me
the cold shoulder

03:53.867 --> 03:55.934
since yesterday's no-show,
so I say we go to him.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.936
He's been staying with long
in a house in DC.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.538
Long's cousin owns the place.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.806
Now, the house
can get a little dicey,

04:00.808 --> 04:02.574
lots of undesirables
coming and going.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.443
Glad to have you folks on board.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.411
We're on it. Warrant came
through. Let's move.

04:06.413 --> 04:09.314
DiNozzo, stay here
and keep digging.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.682
What?!

04:10.684 --> 04:13.518
Boss, are you benching me?!

04:13.520 --> 04:15.587
I thought we were good!

04:46.920 --> 04:48.553
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where are you going?

04:48.555 --> 04:49.988
I let you in to talk,
that's it!

04:49.990 --> 04:52.658
Got a warrant
for sergeant Cole gleason.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.359
Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.161
I said I don't know
where he is.

04:56.162 --> 04:57.962
Guys, up, over there.
Hands on the table.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.431
McGee, bishop,
clear back there?

04:59.433 --> 05:00.999
Whoa, no, no, no, no.
Hey! Hey!

05:01.001 --> 05:03.068
I never said you
could go back there!

05:03.070 --> 05:04.469
Hey, this is my house!

05:04.471 --> 05:05.904
Get over here.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.005
I said this is my house!

05:07.007 --> 05:08.373
Get over here now!

05:08.374 --> 05:09.740
Am I standing
in my own house or not?

05:09.743 --> 05:10.442
Gun!

05:10.444 --> 05:11.443
Get your hands

05:11.445 --> 05:12.778
on top of your head!

05:12.780 --> 05:14.713
(Door closes)

05:14.715 --> 05:17.582
I go take a leak
and all hell breaks loose.

05:17.584 --> 05:20.886
Roy, come on, be nice.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.322
Agent Mitchell,
good to see you again.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.957
Don't mind my cousin.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.793
He tends to lose sight
of the big picture.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.861
Roy gets worked up.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.730
And he does like his guns.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.965
He's clean.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.368
McGee:
Boss?

05:36.370 --> 05:37.636
Place is clear.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.737
No sign of gleason.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.771
Bag this.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.377
Good to see you
making new friends, Mitch.

05:45.379 --> 05:46.678
Benson long.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.979
Yeah.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.083
You're looking for the marine.

05:51.085 --> 05:53.051
He in trouble?
Where is he?

05:53.053 --> 05:55.420
You know, long,
afternoon gambling--

05:55.422 --> 05:57.422
it's not a good look.

05:57.424 --> 05:58.957
I got things to do at night.

05:58.959 --> 05:59.958
Yeah, I bet.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.727
Your marine--

06:01.729 --> 06:03.662
he left, cleared out
his stuff last week.

06:03.664 --> 06:07.065
So, unless there's a law
against hold 'em for quarters,

06:07.067 --> 06:10.135
there's nothing for you here.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.838
This isn't over.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.742
As far as I can see,
it never got started.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.779
Mitch:
Hey.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.848
DEA case files sent over.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.616
Know you're partial to paper.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.618
I talked to bishop.

06:26.619 --> 06:28.619
Sergeant gleason made a charge
last week for a tune-up.

06:28.622 --> 06:31.022
Told the mechanic he's
planning to take a road trip.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.127
Okay, let's call it
what it is.

06:35.129 --> 06:36.461
Cousin Roy didn't talk.

06:36.463 --> 06:37.963
Long's poker club
didn't talk.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.531
There's no drugs
in the house.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.699
And without gleason,
we got nothing.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.067
My office will say the same.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.135
Maybe not.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.470
Long keeps
his operation compact.

06:45.472 --> 06:46.938
DEA has way bigger fish.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.940
I mean...
I-I'm the only one on this.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.042
They're gonna pull me
first chance they get.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.715
(Sighs)

06:56.717 --> 06:59.718
You know,
my dad used to say,

06:59.720 --> 07:02.487
"if it matters to someone,

07:02.489 --> 07:04.456
it matters."

07:05.692 --> 07:07.058
Smart guy.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.194
You would've liked him.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.732
(Quiet laugh)

07:13.734 --> 07:16.101
He liked the ocean.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.136
After he died,
i asked my mom every day

07:18.138 --> 07:20.739
when we were gonna go there
to spread his ashes.

07:20.741 --> 07:24.075
But she just couldn't
bring herself to do it.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.878
She kept saying,
"maybe tomorrow,<i> mijo."</i>

07:26.880 --> 07:28.880
Nah, after a while,

07:28.882 --> 07:31.483
I... I stopped asking her.

07:31.485 --> 07:34.186
Started asking myself.

07:34.188 --> 07:37.489
"Maybe tomorrow" gets old.

07:37.491 --> 07:40.559
Your dad would be proud of
who you are, what you're doing.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.960
(Quiet laugh)

07:41.962 --> 07:44.796
It's starting to feel like
one slow, steady fail.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.065
I've been chasing long
for two years.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.501
And I'm still standing here
with empty pockets.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.136
You asked for my help.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.672
We're gonna see this through,
whatever it takes.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.943
I don't forget my debts, Mitch.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.980
I owe you.

08:10.757 --> 08:13.625
Mechanic said gleason
was headed on a road trip.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.760
You get my message?
Yeah, bolo's out on the car.

08:15.762 --> 08:19.164
No cell or credit card activity
for the last three days, but

08:19.166 --> 08:22.167
records show him disconnecting
from the cellular network

08:22.169 --> 08:24.636
for a period of time
during all of his leaves.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.037
So, that's his thing.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.507
Driving cross-country
unplugged?

08:28.509 --> 08:29.841
Hard to believe long
would let a member of his club

08:29.843 --> 08:31.176
take a vacation.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.044
You think gleason's
on some kind of drug run?

08:33.046 --> 08:34.112
Got the time.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.847
Two weeks left on his leave.

08:35.849 --> 08:36.781
Crap.

08:36.783 --> 08:37.849
What?

08:37.851 --> 08:39.084
Well, if we don't find gleason,

08:39.086 --> 08:40.652
that means Mitch is
gonna be hanging around

08:40.654 --> 08:42.153
for another two weeks.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.922
What's wrong with Mitch?

08:43.924 --> 08:46.625
I don't know.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.693
Keeps calling me "buddy."

08:48.695 --> 08:49.928
It bugs me.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.196
I thought he seemed
really nice.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.265
Are you complaining
about somebody being friendly?

08:53.267 --> 08:56.201
Try getting busywork detail
for no reason.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.536
Start reading, DiNozzo.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.204
Find something on long.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.573
McGee: Boss, aren't we
on sergeant gleason?

09:01.575 --> 09:04.276
I mean, isn't long kind of
an ongoing DEA thing

09:04.278 --> 09:06.177
that Mitch should be
working on with his people

09:06.179 --> 09:08.146
at their office?
Long recruits military.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.314
It makes it our business.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.719
Hey.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.887
Tony?

09:17.157 --> 09:18.790
You find something already?

09:18.792 --> 09:22.561
No, just...

09:22.563 --> 09:24.930
(Sighs)

09:24.932 --> 09:27.666
Don't panic, Gibbs.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.267
It'll all be fine next week.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.235
What'll be fine?

09:30.237 --> 09:32.103
I sprained my fingers.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.305
I got these new platform shoes

09:33.307 --> 09:35.774
and I didn't realize
until afterwards

09:35.776 --> 09:37.409
exactly how tall they were.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.043
After what?
Well, I was dancing around

09:39.046 --> 09:40.845
in my room this morning
and I put my hands up, you know,

09:40.847 --> 09:42.180
'cause the song told me to

09:42.182 --> 09:44.015
and I smashed my fingers

09:44.017 --> 09:45.717
into my skeleton head
disco ball.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.954
I didn't even know
that was a thing.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.155
You didn't know what
was a thing?

09:50.157 --> 09:51.823
Any of it.
Oh.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.158
Well, it is in my house.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.960
But don't worry,
I'm totally fine.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.828
And this won't affect
my work at all.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.263
Okay, what do you got?

09:58.265 --> 10:01.199
The glock from,
um, cousin Roy?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.037
Yeah, the one we took off him.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.606
It's the one you guys
seized from the scene

10:07.608 --> 10:08.773
because it was illegal.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.208
Roy was booked,
but he posted bail.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.343
Well, tell me something
i don't know.

10:11.345 --> 10:12.978
Um, the serial number is gone,

10:12.980 --> 10:14.379
past the point
of raising it.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.780
It was filed down deep.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.015
Can you un-file it?

10:17.017 --> 10:18.283
Well, no, Gibbs,
i can't turn back time.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.218
But I did find fingerprints.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.287
Three sets,
all in the system.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.789
One belonging to cousin Roy.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.758
The other one, long.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.961
And our third set
belongs to...

10:31.031 --> 10:33.064
Oh. Sorry, Gibbs.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.633
My bad fingers hit
the wrong button.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.801
That's just for
future reference.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.004
You know, in case you do
another Gibbs makeover.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.271
Abby.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.774
Um, okay, our third
set of prints belongs

10:42.776 --> 10:44.643
to Fisher hyland.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.378
He's, um, "self-employed."

10:46.380 --> 10:50.081
He's known for selling product
to a pretty shady community,

10:50.083 --> 10:52.350
and he has done time
for possession.

10:52.352 --> 10:55.003
Right up long's alley.

10:55.004 --> 10:57.655
Yep, and his prints are on a
weapon that was handled by long.

10:57.658 --> 10:58.723
Maybe they're
working together.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.992
Exactly.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.727
Keep those
fingers elevated.

11:02.729 --> 11:03.728
McGee.

11:03.730 --> 11:04.729
McGee:
Yeah, boss.

11:04.731 --> 11:05.730
Track down Fisher hyland.

11:05.732 --> 11:06.798
I'm on it.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.101
¶ ¶

11:11.938 --> 11:14.205
bishop:
You sure this is the place?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.940
Yep.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.676
According to his roommate,

11:17.678 --> 11:18.943
hyland keeps a pretty
tight schedule.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.679
So he should be
here by 1:00.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.213
You good?

11:22.215 --> 11:23.682
Yeah.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.685
You're thinking about
Mitch again, aren't you?

11:26.687 --> 11:28.687
What kind of a person
calls you "buddy"

11:28.689 --> 11:30.388
within the first few
seconds of meeting you?

11:30.390 --> 11:33.058
Tim, he really is a good guy.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.060
And Gibbs seems
to really like him, too.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.327
See the way he walks?

11:36.329 --> 11:37.796
I mean, it's ridiculous.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.330
It's, like, it would look good

11:39.332 --> 11:41.332
in one of those slow-motion
action movie walking sequences,

11:41.334 --> 11:42.701
but come on.

11:42.703 --> 11:46.237
So you don't like Mitch
because he's cool?

11:46.239 --> 11:48.139
Look, you know,
standing next to him,

11:48.141 --> 11:49.941
I feel like I'm back
in high school,

11:49.943 --> 11:51.943
getting that one pity
vote for homecoming king.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.779
And by the way, that vote
came from my mother.

11:54.781 --> 11:57.382
I don't know how she snuck in
an illegal ballot, but...

11:58.318 --> 12:00.185
That's pretty.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.053
There he is.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.357
Fisher hyland?

12:06.359 --> 12:08.259
Yeah?

12:09.096 --> 12:10.361
I didn't do anything.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.997
I'm... (Clears throat)
I'm reformed.

12:12.999 --> 12:17.001
So these are the "products"
you're selling to the community?

12:17.003 --> 12:18.236
You break it, you buy it.

12:18.238 --> 12:22.273
We seized a glock
off a guy named Roy Evans.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.008
Had your prints
all over it.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.377
Need to know what the story is.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.246
Yeah, well, I need
a lot of things, man.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.415
Does it look like I'm getting
any of them? (Snickers)

12:30.417 --> 12:32.350
You know what I need?

12:33.153 --> 12:34.786
A little breath of fresh air.

12:34.788 --> 12:37.155
Getting a pretty mean
contact high off this yarn.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.157
Whew.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.426
Yeah, maybe he's not
fully reformed.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.096
Maybe he's, you know,
still a little bit in the weeds.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.332
Well, I think it's reason
enough to search his bag.

12:47.334 --> 12:50.869
Uh, n-no, okay, yeah, uh, Roy.

12:50.871 --> 12:54.172
Yeah, Roy won a glock
off of me in a card game.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.440
You play cards
at his place?

12:55.442 --> 12:56.908
Not anymore.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.177
The only way I go back
is if his cousin leaves.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.779
Benson long.
Yeah.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.314
He started asking me
about the school rave,

13:03.316 --> 13:04.549
uh... (Scoffs)
I was out.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.551
Like dance music?

13:06.553 --> 13:08.453
This is a different
kind of rave.

13:08.455 --> 13:13.324
A drug dealer has "product"
that he needs pushed fast,

13:13.326 --> 13:14.826
so he-he spreads
the word--

13:14.828 --> 13:17.829
basement prices at some
location, some time.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.364
People show up,
they get what they need.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.266
Everyone's gone before
the cops know what happened.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.568
How does the
school fit in?

13:23.569 --> 13:25.869
It's just one of the places they
happen sometimes, the raves.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.474
(Dog barking in distance)

13:36.883 --> 13:40.518
Yeah, I know that smell.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.048
Bishop.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.116
(Flies buzzing)

14:16.990 --> 14:18.990
Boss, we got a body.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.592
It's sergeant gleason.

14:20.594 --> 14:22.060
Send me the location.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.394
I'm on the way.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.331
Gibbs, wait up.
(Elevator dings)

14:30.470 --> 14:32.270
(Elevator dings)

14:34.641 --> 14:36.374
You can't keep
sidelining me.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.909
I got to talk to you.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.945
We got a body.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.547
DiNozzo, it's gleason.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.889
Case files you gave me,

14:50.891 --> 14:54.158
the very first one I opened,
i saw Mitch's full name.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.427
Luis Mitchell.

14:56.429 --> 14:59.230
And it rang a bell,
so I did some digging.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.965
And I know who
he is, Gibbs.

15:00.967 --> 15:03.968
He's the son of Kurt Mitchell,
the nis agent who died

15:03.970 --> 15:05.503
protecting your
wife and daughter.

15:05.505 --> 15:09.040
Franks:<i> The nis agent driving</i>
<i> was hit with a head shot.</i>

15:09.042 --> 15:10.575
(Gun fires)

15:10.577 --> 15:13.244
<i> Your wife and daughter</i>
<i> died in the crash.</i>

15:18.652 --> 15:22.387
Who Mitch is--

15:22.389 --> 15:24.122
not your concern.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.391
Look, I know you feel
indebted to him.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.459
Don't you think we should turn
this over to another team?

15:28.461 --> 15:29.594
What for?

15:31.064 --> 15:32.330
Because if things get sticky,

15:32.332 --> 15:33.598
you and I both know
that you're gonna do

15:33.600 --> 15:35.266
whatever it takes
to protect him.

15:36.937 --> 15:40.204
You think you know
everything, DiNozzo.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.406
You don't.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.274
I'm just trying to
protect you here.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.976
You know why you got sidelined?

15:44.978 --> 15:46.244
This.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.478
This?

15:47.480 --> 15:50.214
This isn't about me.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.616
Take care of your team.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.685
Do your job.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.058
Keep your head in the case.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.228
Keep Mitch's family tree
to yourself.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.297
(Elevator dings)

16:21.147 --> 16:22.513
(Sighs)

16:22.515 --> 16:25.516
"Something, someone,

16:25.518 --> 16:28.252
"some spirit was
pursuing all of us

16:28.254 --> 16:30.254
"across the desert of life

16:30.256 --> 16:33.591
and was bound to catch us
before we reached heaven."

16:35.261 --> 16:36.527
Sounds familiar.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.330
Because it's kerouac,
or because it's you?

16:41.534 --> 16:45.536
Uh, DNA confirmed the
preliminary identification.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.139
Gibbs:
Sergeant gleason?

16:48.141 --> 16:51.442
Yes, he most certainly
wasn't "on the road."

16:51.444 --> 16:52.710
Single gunshot wound
to the head.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.412
Nine millimeter.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.781
Lividity suggests
his body wasn't moved,

16:56.783 --> 16:58.783
and I estimated
the time of death

16:58.785 --> 17:00.735
to be about
three days ago.

17:00.736 --> 17:02.686
That's before he was
supposed to meet Mitch.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.156
Yeah, perhaps it wasn't
a case of cold feet

17:05.158 --> 17:08.693
that kept the sergeant
from handing over his evidence.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.695
Anything else?

17:10.697 --> 17:12.697
Yes, a curiosity.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.666
On his palms and the inside
of his forearms

17:15.668 --> 17:17.135
was some sort of fiber.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.137
Yes, I sent
a sample of it

17:19.139 --> 17:21.039
up to Abby for analysis
along with the bullet.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.573
Okay, thanks, duck.

17:22.575 --> 17:26.477
Jethro, I feel compelled
to ask you about Mitch.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.715
Been talking to DiNozzo.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.583
Uh, I didn't have to.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.219
That's the trouble
with old friends.

17:36.823 --> 17:40.792
Sometimes they know your history
more than you would like.

17:42.062 --> 17:46.130
They also can see
your present state of mind.

17:47.734 --> 17:51.302
This isn't about nis agent
Mitchell's son at all, is it?

17:53.139 --> 17:54.472
It's about Anthony.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.444
Jethro,

17:59.446 --> 18:04.182
when I had my heart attack
on that beach, it changed me.

18:04.184 --> 18:07.718
I had to adopt
a whole new perspective.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.721
I began to see life differently,

18:10.723 --> 18:15.460
and... (Chuckles)
It really concerned me.

18:15.462 --> 18:20.298
Perhaps this newfound view
of yours is accurate,

18:20.300 --> 18:23.568
but you must respect
that others may need time

18:23.570 --> 18:25.837
to see it as you do.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.538
Even Anthony.

18:27.540 --> 18:31.275
Yeah, then there's
the work, duck.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.278
It's got to get done.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.247
You got to respect that, too.

18:40.186 --> 18:42.587
Well, we found
sergeant gleason's car.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.889
McGee: One mile north
of the school,

18:44.891 --> 18:47.725
hidden in some heavy brush
off to the side of the road.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.594
It's on the way
to Abby.

18:49.596 --> 18:52.564
Bishop:
So, working theory is

18:52.565 --> 18:55.533
that sergeant gleason was gonna
provide evidence against long.

18:55.535 --> 18:56.801
Long got wise and killed him

18:56.803 --> 18:58.236
before he had
a chance to deliver.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.238
But we've still got nothing
to connect long

19:00.240 --> 19:02.507
to the murder
or any sort of drug ring.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.508
What about Abby?

19:03.510 --> 19:06.377
You talk
to her, Tony?

19:06.379 --> 19:08.446
Tony?
Huh?

19:09.549 --> 19:11.282
Oh, yeah, uh, just now.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.284
Bullet wasn't a match
to Roy's glock,

19:13.286 --> 19:15.553
and the prints from the
school were a new record:

19:15.555 --> 19:17.522
The most degenerates in one
place she's ever processed,

19:17.524 --> 19:18.523
so...

19:18.525 --> 19:19.924
So nothing that points to long.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.425
No.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.294
Bishop: Great spot
to commit murder.

19:23.296 --> 19:27.231
One that points to every
criminal in town but you.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.900
We've got hyland.

19:28.902 --> 19:31.836
A stoner who says long asked
for directions to the school?

19:31.838 --> 19:33.304
It's not enough.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.306
No, I meant a warrant
for hyland's equipment.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.307
(Phone rings)

19:36.309 --> 19:37.475
This could be it.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.443
This is bishop.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.847
Boss, agent
Malone called.

19:42.849 --> 19:43.948
Yeah, who's that?

19:44.918 --> 19:47.385
NCIS agent Malone.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.920
He's worked here for ten years.

19:48.922 --> 19:50.855
What about him?

19:50.857 --> 19:52.323
Heard about the case,
wants in.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.591
Done a ton of work
with DEA.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.426
Says he'll put his usual
DC team together,

19:55.428 --> 19:56.694
joint investigation.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.962
DEA isn't interested.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.430
He offered
to take point.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.199
Said he was willing
to work with Mitch.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.801
DiNozzo, this is our case.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.736
Bishop:
Thanks.

20:05.738 --> 20:06.938
(Hangs up phone)

20:06.940 --> 20:08.339
Warrant came through.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.408
Good, put hyland to work.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.346
Go on, DiNozzo.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.615
You're with bishop.

20:17.617 --> 20:20.685
Uh, boss, I've established
trust with hyland.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.819
You're with me, McGee.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.821
You and Mitch?

20:23.823 --> 20:24.822
Yeah.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.891
Sounds good.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.731
You good?

20:33.733 --> 20:36.734
Yeah, I'm good.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.002
You sure?

20:38.004 --> 20:39.737
Because McGee said
he was good,

20:39.739 --> 20:42.006
and then the next thing I know,
he's telling me

20:42.008 --> 20:44.475
that his mom voted for him
for homecoming king.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.876
What?

20:45.878 --> 20:47.345
Yeah, I don't know.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.614
He's got some issue with Mitch.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.649
Really?

20:51.651 --> 20:52.650
Mm-hmm.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.818
What is the issue?

20:53.820 --> 20:56.254
That he's super cool.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.521
And that's it?

20:57.523 --> 20:58.522
There's nothing else?

20:58.524 --> 21:00.591
Should there be?

21:02.662 --> 21:04.629
What do I know?

21:04.631 --> 21:06.530
I've been locked in
the office for two days.

21:06.532 --> 21:09.300
Ah, because of Gibbs.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.002
(Sighs)

21:11.004 --> 21:13.004
Look, I know you don't want
to talk about it, but...

21:13.006 --> 21:14.272
Okay.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.539
You want to analyze

21:15.541 --> 21:17.541
Gibbs' "new attitude"?

21:17.543 --> 21:19.744
Let's do it.

21:19.746 --> 21:22.046
You know, after Iraq,

21:22.047 --> 21:24.347
I wasn't the only one with...
A mess to clean up.

21:24.350 --> 21:25.650
What are you talking about?

21:25.652 --> 21:26.984
He got shot by a kid.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.854
A kid that he let
into his own house.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.689
And he pushed
it too far.

21:31.691 --> 21:32.857
Took too many risks.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.358
And now he's doing it again.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.893
He keeps asking,

21:35.895 --> 21:37.862
"who's gonna
protect the team?"

21:37.864 --> 21:39.697
What is he doing?

21:41.401 --> 21:42.967
Ah.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.035
For you.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.471
And... hi.
Uh...

21:47.473 --> 21:50.574
This was supposed
to be for the other guy,

21:50.576 --> 21:52.443
but you can share it with him.

21:54.347 --> 21:55.446
What is this?

21:55.448 --> 21:58.849
Uh, it's a free,
handcrafted beer koozie.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.985
It's a gift.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.720
And in return,
i would like to ask you

22:02.722 --> 22:04.722
to stop calling me.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.590
Right. We need you
to go back to Roy's.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.726
Nah, I...

22:08.728 --> 22:10.461
I don't like his cousin.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.029
And so whatever

22:12.031 --> 22:14.465
you guys are looking into,
I'm out.

22:14.467 --> 22:15.599
Is it just me, bishop,

22:15.601 --> 22:17.101
or are you getting
a little bit of

22:17.103 --> 22:18.703
a contact high off
this beer koozie?

22:18.705 --> 22:19.937
Oof!
Damn it.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.339
Look.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.540
All you have to do

22:22.542 --> 22:23.674
is go back to the house

22:23.676 --> 22:25.576
and play cards.

22:25.578 --> 22:26.977
Yeah.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.079
Here's a great idea.

22:28.081 --> 22:29.680
You like giving gifts.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.882
Give this one to
your friend Roy.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.120
That's some way
to sprain your fingers.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.888
You know, I dabble
in shoe-making.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.357
Learned from my<i> abuelo.</i>

22:39.359 --> 22:40.591
If you want,
i could, um,

22:40.593 --> 22:42.026
shave an inch or so
off those platforms,

22:42.028 --> 22:43.127
make 'em a little safer.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.364
Okay, is that not
the coolest thing

22:46.366 --> 22:47.898
you've ever
heard, McGee?

22:47.900 --> 22:49.567
Mitch can cobble!

22:50.503 --> 22:51.936
I'm kind of
loving this.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.572
Mitch and McGee.
M&M.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.907
The cool cobbler and the...

22:56.909 --> 22:58.576
And the...

22:58.578 --> 23:00.044
The what?

23:00.046 --> 23:02.947
And... and the other guy.

23:04.517 --> 23:05.783
Can we get
to the evidence, please?

23:05.785 --> 23:07.051
That's a good call, buddy.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.053
Yeah, okay.
So...

23:09.055 --> 23:11.389
The red is where
i found fibers

23:11.391 --> 23:12.957
on sergeant gleason's
body and clothes.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.925
The position
and abundance

23:14.927 --> 23:16.660
tell me that it was from
something he was carrying

23:16.662 --> 23:17.661
before he died.

23:17.663 --> 23:18.929
Any idea what it was?

23:18.931 --> 23:20.931
Of course I do, Mitch.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.067
The fiber is wool,

23:23.069 --> 23:24.602
and based on
the size and shape,

23:24.604 --> 23:26.470
I can tell it's from
some type of rug.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.973
We need one of her at the DEA.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.409
Well, we've got
the one and only.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.943
So this is
sergeant gleason's car.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.578
I found the same
fibers in here.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.747
So the rug was in the trunk,
and now it's gone.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.416
Well, if long killed gleason

23:38.418 --> 23:40.184
before he could
give me the evidence...

23:40.185 --> 23:41.951
The evidence could be on the rug
or wrapped inside.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.487
And long
took it back.

23:43.489 --> 23:44.555
That's something.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.123
That's good stuff.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.191
And she's not done yet.

23:48.161 --> 23:49.660
So this particular wool

23:49.662 --> 23:51.562
comes from the karakul sheep...
Aw.

23:51.564 --> 23:54.165
...in the northern provinces
of Afghanistan.

23:54.167 --> 23:57.134
The absence of wear tells
me that the rug was new.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.603
Now, there's 28 stores
in the local area

23:59.605 --> 24:01.906
that sell rugs that are
imported from Afghanistan,

24:01.908 --> 24:04.809
but only one-- one--

24:04.811 --> 24:07.578
is owned
by long's cousin Roy.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.814
Ha!
There's a sight for sore eyes.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.182
All right, everything
we have is circumstantial,

24:11.184 --> 24:13.717
but if we break Roy,
we'll get long.

24:13.719 --> 24:14.952
Let's pick him up.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.186
Afternoon card game
should be done.

24:16.189 --> 24:18.856
Well, the web site says
that the owner will be there

24:18.858 --> 24:21.459
for appraisals
starting at 3:00.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.226
Great.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.496
Roy:
What do you want?

24:25.498 --> 24:26.931
Roy, we'd like to talk
to you about rugs,

24:26.933 --> 24:28.466
if that's possible.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.967
What about 'em?

24:29.969 --> 24:31.168
Mitch:
Well, you see,

24:31.170 --> 24:32.870
we found evidence of a rug

24:32.872 --> 24:35.172
similar to the one you sell
here in this location.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.641
And do you know where
that rug was, at one time?

24:37.643 --> 24:38.709
Dead marine's car.

24:38.711 --> 24:39.977
Mitch:
That's right, agent Gibbs.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.745
The trunk of
a dead marine's car.

24:41.747 --> 24:44.048
Now, you remember us
coming to your house

24:44.050 --> 24:45.616
and asking you
about that marine?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.053
(Quietly):
Yeah.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.187
Sorry. What was that?

24:50.189 --> 24:51.088
Yeah.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.623
Mitch:
Yeah?

24:52.625 --> 24:53.891
Well, that's kind of why

24:53.893 --> 24:55.226
we want to talk rugs
with you, Roy.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.229
All right.

24:59.632 --> 25:00.764
Gun!

25:00.766 --> 25:02.066
(Grunting)

25:02.068 --> 25:03.801
Mitch, get down!
No, no!

25:03.803 --> 25:05.102
(Grunting)

25:06.506 --> 25:08.239
No, no, no!
We need him!

25:09.809 --> 25:11.876
Hang on.

25:11.878 --> 25:13.010
Come on, Evans.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.144
Breathe.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.713
Get an ambulance.
Breathe,
damn it.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.957
¶ ¶

25:26.959 --> 25:29.760
(siren whoops)

25:31.697 --> 25:33.264
There's nothing back there.

25:33.266 --> 25:34.665
Gibbs check in?

25:34.667 --> 25:36.700
He called about a half hour ago.

25:36.702 --> 25:37.701
Roy's still in surgery.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.003
We're gonna need
him to talk.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.738
There's nothing
here to go on.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.039
Well, we're seizing
all the rugs,

25:42.041 --> 25:44.208
and bishop brought back
a bunch of store records.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.277
So if there's anything here,
Abby will find it.

25:46.279 --> 25:47.978
I said, there's nothing here.

25:49.181 --> 25:51.315
Hey. Roy awake?

25:51.317 --> 25:53.083
Did you talk to him?
No.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.185
He didn't make it.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.558
Damn it!

26:00.560 --> 26:01.959
Hey, we'll get long another way.

26:03.629 --> 26:05.229
Roy talking was
the only shot we had,

26:05.231 --> 26:07.097
and you killed him.
He could've killed you.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.132
He could've killed any of us.

26:08.134 --> 26:09.367
I told you we needed him!
Hey.

26:09.368 --> 26:10.601
Enough. Hey.
I think you need
to take a walk

26:10.603 --> 26:11.669
around the block, buddy!
Hey! Enough!

26:13.072 --> 26:15.072
Unbelievable.

26:17.843 --> 26:19.043
You did a good job, McGee.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.278
You did exactly
what you had to do.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.247
(Sighs)

26:23.249 --> 26:25.583
Go. Head back to the office.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.928
It's over.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.730
It's all over.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.634
Abby:
It needs to be
one continuous cut,

26:43.636 --> 26:44.969
and it has
to be precise,

26:44.971 --> 26:46.370
because we don't know
what we're dealing with, here.

26:46.372 --> 26:47.972
You know what?

26:47.974 --> 26:49.273
Maybe I should
just do it myself.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.742
Nonsense. No.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.110
Inarticulate hands

26:53.112 --> 26:54.712
do not a precise cut make.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.780
Besides, if
nothing else,

26:56.782 --> 27:00.084
I am "the incision-ator."

27:03.322 --> 27:05.723
There's definitely something
sewn in there.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.791
Ducky:
Yes, definitely.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.330
A narcotic of some sort?

27:13.332 --> 27:16.100
Okay, so...

27:16.102 --> 27:18.335
The evidence that sergeant
gleason was bringing to Mitch

27:18.337 --> 27:20.938
wasn't on the rug
or wrapped up in it.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.740
It<i> was</i> the rug.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.408
This is how long
has been smuggling

27:24.410 --> 27:26.243
into the country.

27:26.245 --> 27:29.146
If this rug was imported
from Afghanistan,

27:29.148 --> 27:31.348
then this seems likely
to be heroin.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.950
Interestingly enough,

27:32.952 --> 27:35.319
the first reference
of opium growth

27:35.321 --> 27:37.755
is in 3400 bc in mesopotamia,

27:37.757 --> 27:39.256
though there is evidence...

27:40.426 --> 27:42.092
Ducky.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.227
I love listening
to you talk,

27:43.229 --> 27:44.228
but I have to interrupt you.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.696
Oh.

27:45.698 --> 27:46.964
Okay, it seems like
there's something

27:46.966 --> 27:48.899
sewn into all of these,

27:48.901 --> 27:50.968
but I tested the fibers
and none of them

27:50.970 --> 27:53.303
are the one that
sergeant gleason had.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.839
Long would have been smart
to get rid of it.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.875
Exactly.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.977
Because long is smart.

27:59.979 --> 28:03.781
Now, all of our shipping orders
say that the rugs got here

28:03.783 --> 28:05.315
just when long got to town,

28:05.317 --> 28:08.786
but everything we have
points to dead cousin Roy.

28:08.788 --> 28:11.355
All right, there's just
got to be something here

28:11.357 --> 28:12.956
that shows
long was running the show.

28:12.958 --> 28:13.991
I just have to...

28:13.993 --> 28:15.392
I have to find it,

28:15.394 --> 28:17.461
and bishop asked me to help
her with something else,

28:17.463 --> 28:19.763
and I can't bend my fingers
and I'm overwhelmed...

28:19.765 --> 28:21.865
Abby, I love to hear you talk,

28:21.867 --> 28:23.133
but I must interrupt.

28:23.135 --> 28:26.170
There's no need
to be overwhelmed.

28:26.172 --> 28:30.274
I am here
to continue assisting you.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.476
Well...

28:32.478 --> 28:34.044
Thank god for teamwork.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.479
(Chuckles)

28:36.782 --> 28:38.882
McGee. I heard it was like
the wild west out there.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.484
What happened?
Could've used you
at the crime scene.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.252
Hey, you think
i wanted to stay here?

28:42.254 --> 28:44.354
So did Gibbs jump
in front of Mitch

28:44.356 --> 28:46.023
or pull any
crazy hero stuff?

28:46.025 --> 28:47.157
What?

28:47.159 --> 28:48.392
Is he okay?

28:48.394 --> 28:50.260
Gibbs? Yeah.

28:51.931 --> 28:54.064
I'm okay, too, by the way.
Thanks.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.233
Oh, yeah. Of course. Good.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.301
That's good, too.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.370
So give me the play-by-play.

29:00.372 --> 29:03.040
Well, Roy pulled a gun,

29:03.042 --> 29:05.476
I shot him,
and Mitch reamed me for it.

29:05.478 --> 29:06.977
Mitch got in your face?

29:06.979 --> 29:08.011
Yes, he did.

29:08.013 --> 29:09.480
So much for
the super cool guy

29:09.482 --> 29:11.081
everyone thought
he was, huh?

29:11.083 --> 29:12.750
Then it was weird.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.284
I felt like
Gibbs sent me back here

29:14.286 --> 29:16.153
so he could talk to Mitch.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.387
I mean,
i don't know.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.022
I just feel like
something's going on

29:19.024 --> 29:21.225
that I don't
know about.
(Sighs)

29:21.227 --> 29:23.227
What?

29:25.097 --> 29:27.097
Maybe there's something going on
you don't know about.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.068
What?

29:31.069 --> 29:32.202
Tony, what the hell is going on
that I don't know about?

29:32.204 --> 29:34.471
Hey, you're back.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.443
What's going on?

29:40.513 --> 29:41.545
Okay, I'm done.

29:41.547 --> 29:42.813
Conference room.
Campfire.

29:42.815 --> 29:43.881
Let's go.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.249
Uh...

29:45.251 --> 29:47.117
Do I need my laptop?
Tony:
Yes!

29:52.424 --> 29:54.091
So that's Mitch's dad.

29:54.093 --> 29:56.160
McGee:
Nis agent Kurt Mitchell.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.327
I never would've
connected the two.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.796
And he was assigned

29:58.798 --> 30:00.130
to protect Gibbs' family?

30:00.132 --> 30:01.965
1991. Oceanside.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.401
I thought Shannon
and Kelly lived here.

30:04.403 --> 30:05.969
They did.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.238
They followed Gibbs
to Pendleton before he deployed.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.008
You can pull up the old nis
file and read it for yourself.

30:11.010 --> 30:14.144
Shannon and Kelly Gibbs
were scheduled to testify

30:14.146 --> 30:15.879
against drug dealer
Pedro Hernandez

30:15.881 --> 30:18.081
for a murder
they saw him commit.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.449
Hernandez shot
agent Mitchell

30:19.451 --> 30:21.351
as he drove them
to a safe house.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.320
Mitchell died instantly.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.089
Shannon and Kelly were killed
in the crash.

30:26.091 --> 30:28.192
What happened to Hernandez?

30:29.295 --> 30:31.595
He died soon after.

30:31.597 --> 30:35.098
So, if Mitch's dad was killed
protecting Gibbs' family...

30:35.100 --> 30:37.434
Then Gibbs will do
all sorts of crazy cowboy stuff

30:37.436 --> 30:39.036
to protect Mitch.
Thank god!

30:39.038 --> 30:41.004
I finally got to say it
out loud.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.139
We got to protect Gibbs.

30:42.141 --> 30:44.041
Yes, we do.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.509
And while we're
stuck in here,

30:45.511 --> 30:47.411
they're out there
doing god knows what.

30:47.413 --> 30:49.012
Can you ping their cell phones
or something?

30:49.014 --> 30:50.881
Bishop:
Uh, were you guys gonna bother

30:50.883 --> 30:51.982
telling me about long?

30:51.984 --> 30:53.250
It's a pretty
important detail.

30:53.252 --> 30:55.419
Long? What about him?

30:55.421 --> 30:57.154
Says right here in the file.

30:57.156 --> 31:01.258
"1990, Benson long began
operating around Pendleton."

31:01.260 --> 31:03.060
You didn't know?

31:06.031 --> 31:09.366
Where are you, duck?
Need to talk.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.202
Ducky.

31:12.204 --> 31:15.239
Why didn't you tell me long
was more than some random case?

31:16.375 --> 31:17.641
No.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.877
Hey, get off my back!

31:19.879 --> 31:21.178
Not letting you walk away.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.046
It's in the nis file.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.315
Hernandez was a small-time
dealer in a big cartel,

31:25.317 --> 31:27.050
and he may have
pulled the trigger,

31:27.052 --> 31:29.052
but he didn't make
the big decisions.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.587
Long was his boss.
What about it?

31:30.589 --> 31:32.155
What do you mean,
"what about it"?

31:32.157 --> 31:34.424
This is personal for you,
Gibbs, you and Mitch.

31:34.426 --> 31:35.893
You want revenge
for your families,

31:35.895 --> 31:37.160
but what does that mean?

31:37.162 --> 31:38.662
Are you gonna put
a bullet in long's head

31:38.664 --> 31:40.130
the way you did to Hernandez?

31:40.132 --> 31:41.398
Gonna tell you
this one time.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.667
We're gonna get long
on good evidence.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.269
This is above board.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.405
Do you understand
what I just said?

31:48.407 --> 31:50.340
I understand if you let Mitch
get dirty, you get dirty, too.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.341
N-n-no, we agreed.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.076
This is above board.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.678
Then what is he doing
right now? Where is he?

31:54.680 --> 31:56.413
I just talked to him,
he's at his hotel.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.614
We're gonna start
fresh in the morning.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.349
No, he lied to you.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.084
We just pinged his phone.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.586
He's at long's place.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.292
I'm doing this alone.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.626
(Elevator dings)

32:09.628 --> 32:11.695
I know.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.645
What happened?

32:28.646 --> 32:30.212
Gibbs went after Mitch,
didn't want backup.

32:30.215 --> 32:32.950
Great, now we have nothing to do
but wait to hear.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.252
Uh, no, we have to
push ahead, right?

32:35.254 --> 32:36.687
Uh, find something
solid on long.

32:36.689 --> 32:39.056
If he was part
of this reynosa cartel,

32:39.058 --> 32:40.741
we should start looking
into that.

32:40.742 --> 32:42.425
Well, you think Mitch would have
already done that, you know?

32:42.428 --> 32:43.694
The cartel fell from power
years ago.

32:43.696 --> 32:46.229
Now long is on his own,
flying under the radar.

32:46.231 --> 32:48.565
There's the hyland factor.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.200
That's right.
Everyone's favorite knitter.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.252
Is he still in play?

32:52.253 --> 32:54.303
He gave cousin Roy the gift
before your run-in at the store,

32:54.306 --> 32:56.340
but-- I don't know--
as of an hour ago,

32:56.342 --> 32:58.608
we're still getting some kind
of interference.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.310
Abby's helping me with it.

33:02.581 --> 33:03.613
Where are you going?

33:03.615 --> 33:05.515
Done taking orders.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.150
You coming?

33:09.388 --> 33:12.322
Uh, where are you guys going?
Stay here, bishop.
We need you on the inside.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.158
We'll call you from the car.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.993
Abby: Bishop, what's up?
Abby, are you getting anything?

33:19.098 --> 33:21.031
Mind's made up.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.566
Tried catching him
the right way.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.134
Two years, I tried.

33:24.136 --> 33:26.136
That old file--

33:26.138 --> 33:29.206
lot of names in there.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.142
You kill long,

33:32.144 --> 33:36.613
then it'll be his ten bosses
and then...

33:36.615 --> 33:39.216
Their bosses.

33:40.152 --> 33:43.153
There is no end.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.155
And what,
my dad wouldn't want me

33:45.157 --> 33:46.556
throwing away my career,
my life?

33:46.558 --> 33:48.291
Yeah. You're damn right.

33:48.293 --> 33:50.060
Gibbs, just go.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.700
Guy named Mike Franks,
he used to work with your dad.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.169
He told me
that the agent

33:59.171 --> 34:01.571
who was supposed
to protect my family

34:01.573 --> 34:05.642
asked off the detail because
it was getting too dangerous.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.345
He had little kids.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.518
Mike asked for a volunteer
to replace him,

34:14.520 --> 34:18.522
and your dad raised his hand.

34:18.524 --> 34:21.191
And he said to Franks,

34:21.193 --> 34:25.228
"I'd want someone to do the same
for my family."

34:29.201 --> 34:32.602
So, no, Mitch.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.673
I'm not going anywhere.

34:36.675 --> 34:39.142
(Door opens)

34:39.144 --> 34:41.211
(Door shuts)

34:53.292 --> 34:55.358
Roy let you in?

34:59.498 --> 35:02.766
Where is he?
You, uh...

35:02.768 --> 35:05.469
You haul him off?
(Chuckles)

35:05.471 --> 35:07.137
He's dead.

35:11.777 --> 35:15.445
This is my
notification?

35:15.447 --> 35:17.314
What the hell
happened?

35:17.316 --> 35:19.216
We shot him.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.620
For what?

35:23.622 --> 35:25.522
Because we could.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.591
(Chuckles)

35:29.528 --> 35:32.262
You son of a bitch.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.431
You think you're untouchable?

35:35.467 --> 35:36.867
I'm untouchable.

35:38.504 --> 35:40.270
I took out gleason, and...

35:40.272 --> 35:42.539
I said
"go"...

35:42.541 --> 35:43.540
(Clicks tongue)

35:43.542 --> 35:45.175
...daddy took a headshot.

35:45.177 --> 35:47.377
Eh?

35:47.379 --> 35:48.778
There's nothing you can do
about it.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.413
(Scoffs)

35:50.415 --> 35:51.414
Hey.

35:51.416 --> 35:52.582
Mitch.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.422
What are
you gonna do?

35:59.424 --> 36:01.424
Hmm?

36:01.426 --> 36:04.828
I mean, I don't even have
anything on me.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.164
What, he's gonna plant a piece
on me?

36:07.166 --> 36:10.300
Is that what
he's gonna do?

36:10.302 --> 36:12.669
What are you gonna do?

36:12.671 --> 36:14.871
Mitch,

36:14.873 --> 36:16.873
you know what I did.

36:16.875 --> 36:19.709
It didn't fix
a thing.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.612
It didn't bring them back.

36:29.354 --> 36:32.289
(Exhales)

36:32.291 --> 36:34.558
(Exhales)

36:34.560 --> 36:38.328
That's... what
i thought.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.564
(Door opens)

36:40.566 --> 36:42.332
Hands behind
your back, long.

36:42.334 --> 36:44.267
What kind of circus is this?

36:44.269 --> 36:45.535
Turn around.

36:45.537 --> 36:46.603
McGee.

36:46.605 --> 36:47.804
We got everything
we need, boss.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.339
Hey, bishop.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.575
Putting you on
speakerphone.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.243
You get all that?

36:53.245 --> 36:54.711
Whoa. Oh, yeah.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.280
Hey. Ducky and I went through
everything from the store.

36:57.282 --> 36:59.950
We didn't find anything.
Well, once
you got it online,

36:59.952 --> 37:01.618
poker chip cam worked
like a charm.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.420
And?

37:03.422 --> 37:05.455
We got long's confession,

37:05.457 --> 37:06.723
recorded for the ages.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.325
Thank god for teamwork.

37:08.327 --> 37:09.459
Makes the dream work.

37:09.461 --> 37:10.560
Listen, if you
guys are hugging,

37:10.562 --> 37:11.561
keep doing that.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.296
I'll be there in a few minutes.

37:16.368 --> 37:17.567
Hey, McGee.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.737
Thank you.

37:25.544 --> 37:27.344
(Exhales)

37:29.314 --> 37:31.014
You okay?

37:31.016 --> 37:33.750
Mm-hmm.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.252
Are you?

37:50.836 --> 37:53.303
Hey.
Hey.

37:53.305 --> 37:55.972
Going somewhere?

37:55.974 --> 37:57.674
Oh.

37:57.676 --> 38:00.977
Well, I heard
you're headed to California.

38:00.979 --> 38:05.282
I'm taking a personal day.

38:05.284 --> 38:06.983
You're not coming with me.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.452
(Chuckles)
I know.

38:09.454 --> 38:12.722
Um, yeah, this. So, this is
called a garment bag.

38:12.724 --> 38:15.625
And, uh, in light of all
the nice new clothes you have,

38:15.627 --> 38:17.894
uh, theoretically,
what this does when you travel

38:17.896 --> 38:19.829
is, it keeps it,
uh, wrinkle-free.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.332
And I had an extra one
laying around.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.984
Iraq...

38:40.986 --> 38:43.453
I mean...

38:43.455 --> 38:44.721
(Chuckles)

38:44.723 --> 38:47.891
It was pretty screwed up, right?

38:47.893 --> 38:51.895
We ever gonna... talk about it?

38:51.897 --> 38:55.465
No, it's not about Iraq.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.866
Where are you, DiNozzo?

38:56.868 --> 38:59.002
What do you mean? I'm
right here, where I always am.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.737
Well, then let me ask you
something.

39:00.739 --> 39:01.938
Is that what you want?

39:01.940 --> 39:03.540
Do I want to be here? Yeah.

39:03.542 --> 39:06.042
I wouldn't be
if it wasn't what I wanted.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.911
Years ago, you had a shot
at your own team.

39:07.913 --> 39:09.913
You turned
it down.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.648
Yeah, that was my decision.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.483
Do you want to be a leader
or not?

39:13.485 --> 39:16.720
You mean, do I want to be you?

39:20.659 --> 39:24.728
Day I joined nis,
all I had was a reason.

39:25.664 --> 39:29.032
Things change.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.368
The reason stays the same.

39:31.370 --> 39:34.637
It's always
with me.

39:34.639 --> 39:37.407
Never leaves.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.075
Shannon and Kelly.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.578
Either you got a reason
or you don't.

39:45.984 --> 39:48.051
¶ ¶

39:50.722 --> 39:53.590
¶ since I can remember ¶

39:53.592 --> 39:57.494
¶ you're all I know ¶

39:58.830 --> 40:02.098
¶ from the summers to winters ¶

40:02.100 --> 40:06.069
¶ through laughter and woe ¶

40:06.071 --> 40:10.540
¶ well, my memory's fading ¶

40:10.542 --> 40:13.710
¶ and my heart, it beats slow ¶

40:13.712 --> 40:16.012
my mom--
still too much for her.

40:19.418 --> 40:21.651
She didn't know how to thank you
for coming.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.021
She's making tamales.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.560
(Sighs)

40:30.562 --> 40:33.062
Something I got to do first.

40:34.032 --> 40:39.836
¶ There's one left to do ¶

40:39.838 --> 40:43.106
¶ we all face the river ¶

40:43.108 --> 40:47.577
¶ and cross it alone ¶

40:47.579 --> 40:52.949
¶ and if I can't take you
with me, I just... ¶

40:52.951 --> 40:55.151
woman:
Hi.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.853
You here for the open house?

40:56.855 --> 40:57.854
No.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.522
No, I'm just looking.

40:59.524 --> 41:01.224
I can take you through
right now.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.493
It's okay.

41:05.163 --> 41:07.163
I used to live here.

41:07.165 --> 41:08.164
Really?

41:08.166 --> 41:10.500
Well, then welcome home.

41:10.502 --> 41:12.035
You take your time.

41:12.037 --> 41:14.137
Thank you.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.206
¶ ¶

41:28.119 --> 41:32.055
¶ every step of my life ¶

41:32.057 --> 41:35.525
¶ I've walked them with you ¶

41:35.527 --> 41:38.661
¶ as it comes to an end ¶

41:38.663 --> 41:43.666
¶ there's one left to do ¶

41:43.668 --> 41:47.203
¶ we all face the river ¶

41:47.205 --> 41:51.774
¶ and cross it alone ¶

41:51.776 --> 41:55.778
¶ and if I can't take you
with me ¶

41:55.780 --> 42:00.183
¶ I just won't go ¶

42:00.185 --> 42:04.787
¶ no, if I can't take you
with me ¶

42:04.789 --> 42:09.259
¶ I just won't go. ¶
