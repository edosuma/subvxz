00:07.050 --> 00:08.138
McGEE:
Is he hurt?

00:08.182 --> 00:10.010
She's been shot.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.141
RUTHANN:
Is that a kennel?

00:12.534 --> 00:13.665
Good Lord.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.145
Your neighbor wasn't
fishing with his dogs.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.755
He was drowning them.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.409
Who the hell are you?

00:18.453 --> 00:19.802
[grunting]

00:19.845 --> 00:21.064
TORRES:
Gibbs, Gibbs, let go.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.458
Not like this.
Not like this.Let go.

00:23.501 --> 00:24.937
Tell me you regret what you did.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.374
Can't do that.In that case,

00:26.417 --> 00:28.898
I have no choice
but to suspend you.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.552
Indefinitely.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.775
I believe in America.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.300
I believe in the working man.

00:39.343 --> 00:44.174
The tired single parent
and part-time volleyball coach.

00:44.218 --> 00:48.004
And I believe in his right
to take a break from all of that

00:48.048 --> 00:51.660
and drive 300 miles
to see his favorite musician.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.357
The Boss.

00:53.401 --> 00:56.143
Who we both know is about
to play an acoustic set

00:56.186 --> 00:59.711
to a very small group
of VIPs.

00:59.755 --> 01:02.062
And I deserve to be one of them.

01:02.105 --> 01:03.976
Please.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.543
Let me in.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.241
No.

01:07.284 --> 01:09.112
I didn't want to play
this card, but...

01:09.156 --> 01:12.898
I have his face
tattooed on my...

01:12.942 --> 01:15.379
Sir, if you drop trou,

01:15.423 --> 01:17.251
I will use my stun gun.

01:18.295 --> 01:19.644
[unzips]

01:21.994 --> 01:24.432
[whimpering]

01:24.475 --> 01:26.260
Uh, joke's on you, pal.

01:26.303 --> 01:29.089
After the third time,
it didn't even hurt.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.359
EMCEE [in distance]:
Hello, Washington, D.C.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.796
[cheering, applause]

01:40.839 --> 01:42.885
Are you ready?

01:42.928 --> 01:46.802
We've got an awesome show
for you tonight.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.499
With no further ado...Boss.

01:48.543 --> 01:49.935
I'm coming.

01:49.979 --> 01:52.024
I give you, the live tour,

01:52.068 --> 01:54.766
the Emperor of E Street,

01:54.810 --> 01:57.987
I give you The Boss.[cheering, applause]

01:59.162 --> 02:00.946
Aah!
[grunts]

02:03.645 --> 02:05.647
[grunting]

02:09.303 --> 02:11.479
Oh...

02:11.522 --> 02:13.829
That's not my blood.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.570
Aah!

02:18.703 --> 02:20.705
â™ª

02:49.169 --> 02:52.302
[phone rings]PAMELA: Director, I have
Secretary of Defense McClane

02:52.346 --> 02:54.652
for you.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.132
On what line, Pamela?

02:56.176 --> 02:58.613
He's not on the phone, sir.

02:58.656 --> 02:59.831
[door opens]

02:59.875 --> 03:01.355
Director Vance.

03:01.398 --> 03:02.704
Mr. Secretary.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.749
Welcome.My apologies for the surprise.

03:04.793 --> 03:05.924
I'm, um,

03:05.968 --> 03:07.578
I'm squeezing
in face time

03:07.622 --> 03:10.102
with agency heads
when and where I can.

03:10.146 --> 03:12.148
Lieutenant,
give us a minute, please?

03:15.804 --> 03:19.199
Plus, I just wanted to see
if what they tell me is true.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.592
That Leon Vance has
gained ten pounds

03:21.636 --> 03:23.768
and lost his right hook.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.902
You son of a bitch.

03:26.945 --> 03:28.164
[laughs]Come on, I'll show you.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.339
Come here.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.254
It's more like 20 pounds.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.474
Yeah, right? Right, it's
good to see you, man.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.476
It's good to see you, too.Yeah. Surprised?

03:35.519 --> 03:37.042
What, that Congress
approved your waiver

03:37.086 --> 03:38.392
or that the Senate
actually confirmed you

03:38.435 --> 03:40.307
to be the secretary?[both laugh]

03:40.350 --> 03:42.961
Seriously,
congratulations, Moses.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.485
Thanks, Leon.You also have
my sympathies.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.530
That job is one tough hill
to climb.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.228
Oh, well, I
like those.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.578
It's why the Marine Corps
gave me four stars.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.233
And why my doctor
just gave me new stress meds.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.538
You always go for the knockout.

03:54.582 --> 03:55.800
Oh, you better
believe it.

03:55.844 --> 03:57.193
Starting with...

03:57.237 --> 03:58.934
hosting the Yemeni
foreign affairs minister

03:58.977 --> 04:01.328
at my house later this week.

04:01.371 --> 04:04.331
Forget the knockout, Mose,
you going for the title belt.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.463
The Yemenis agreed to sit down?

04:06.507 --> 04:08.596
Which brings me
to why I'm really here, Leon.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.250
Now, I understand
one of your agents

04:10.293 --> 04:12.643
was recently been suspended for,

04:12.687 --> 04:14.689
shall we say,
conduct unbecoming?

04:14.732 --> 04:17.735
Gibbs. I didn't realize that
that incident

04:17.779 --> 04:19.607
made its way
so far up the ladder.

04:19.650 --> 04:20.825
Well, normally,
it wouldn't,

04:20.869 --> 04:22.305
but a reporter's been calling,

04:22.349 --> 04:26.135
asking for DoD comment,
and the timing isn't ideal.

04:26.178 --> 04:28.398
And any negative press
could spook the Yemenis.

04:28.442 --> 04:31.532
Yeah, which is exactly why
I'm not returning those calls.Mm.

04:31.575 --> 04:34.361
And why I'm asking NCIS
not to comment.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.667
Now, I appreciate the
reporter's position.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.321
We don't need
the court of public opinion

04:38.365 --> 04:40.105
to readjudicate that case.

04:40.149 --> 04:42.630
The matter has been handled,
Mr. Secretary.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.501
But I understand.

04:44.545 --> 04:45.937
Ah.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.113
And...

04:48.157 --> 04:49.593
what about Agent Gibbs?

04:49.637 --> 04:51.552
Gibbs doesn't talk
to reporters.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.380
And neither will his team.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.512
They are skating on thin ice
as it is.

04:55.556 --> 04:57.471
Thanks, Leon.

04:57.514 --> 05:02.476
Listen, politics aside,
Yemen is in crisis.

05:02.519 --> 05:05.696
So this summit has
humanitarian implications.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.351
Is there anything else
NCIS can do for you?

05:08.395 --> 05:12.486
Well, now that you mention it,
there is one small thing.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.447
Oh, thanks, Todd.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.016
Todd seem weird to you?

05:21.059 --> 05:22.757
Todd is not judging us, Bishop.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.325
But you saw him, right?
I mean, he clearly knows.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.327
Everyone at NCIS knows.

05:27.370 --> 05:30.373
That Gibbs got suspended
indefinitely

05:30.417 --> 05:34.812
or that we got caught
trying to protect him?

05:34.856 --> 05:36.553
All of it.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.382
Something we can
help you with, Sawyer?

05:39.426 --> 05:41.515
Justice, McGee.

05:41.558 --> 05:44.256
That is our job
as special agents, right?

05:44.300 --> 05:46.650
To make sure
those who break the rules

05:46.694 --> 05:50.524
face the consequences
of their actions.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.090
Even the cool kids.

05:52.134 --> 05:53.744
BISHOP:
Look, Sawyer,

05:53.788 --> 05:55.442
we messed up and we know it,

05:55.485 --> 05:59.924
and we will face
the consequences of our actions.

05:59.968 --> 06:02.623
Except there haven't been
any consequences.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.929
I mean,
Gibbs took it on the chin,

06:04.973 --> 06:07.715
but his disciples
barely got a reprimand.

06:07.758 --> 06:08.977
Why?

06:09.020 --> 06:10.413
Hey, Sawyer.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.501
Go home.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.547
The night shift is over.

06:13.590 --> 06:16.027
Oh, I think it's just beginning.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.902
What is he talking about?Okay, forget it, Nick.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.252
Let's just keep our heads down
and solve the next case

06:23.295 --> 06:24.558
that comes along.[phone ringing]

06:24.601 --> 06:26.560
Well, not mine.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.780
NCIS Special Agent

06:29.824 --> 06:31.216
Veronica Tyler.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.696
Yep.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.437
On our way.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.657
Let's go. We got a body.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.746
Hey, Ronnie, you guys
are working the day shift now?

06:38.789 --> 06:40.617
[grunts]
Told you.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.403
A new day is dawning.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.709
Sawyer, stop being a dick
and grab your gear.

06:50.105 --> 06:51.846
Did we just get passed over?

06:51.889 --> 06:54.457
VANCE:
You're being reassigned.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.546
Uh, Director?

06:56.590 --> 06:58.461
Are we being punished, sir?

06:58.505 --> 07:00.550
Well, it depends on what
you consider punishment.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.465
The new
Secretary of Defense

07:02.509 --> 07:05.120
is hosting an event
at his home in three days,

07:05.163 --> 07:07.078
and I'm assigning your team
to the detail.

07:07.122 --> 07:08.602
Oh, well, then, we're on it.Hmm.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.038
McGEE:
Fancy event?
Can't be that bad.

07:10.081 --> 07:11.692
Yeah, dress up a little bit.

07:11.735 --> 07:14.999
I'm sorry,
I-I didn't make myself clear.

07:15.043 --> 07:17.480
I'm not assigning your team
to a security detail.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.526
You won't be attending
the event.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.832
Uh, what kind of detail
is this, sir?

07:21.876 --> 07:23.791
COVID detail.

07:23.834 --> 07:24.966
The three of you
are gonna be

07:25.009 --> 07:26.881
our new health
compliance officers.

07:26.924 --> 07:29.405
I trust you can
handle this assignment

07:29.449 --> 07:31.189
without further embarrassing me,

07:31.233 --> 07:33.453
the agency or yourselves
in any way?

07:36.281 --> 07:38.109
Your jobs depend on it.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.502
Okay, yeah.
We're on it.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.156
Uh, yes, sir.McGEE: Yes, sir, absolutely.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.287
Good.

07:43.811 --> 07:46.291
Yeah, we're
being punished.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.258
[indistinct chatter]

07:58.521 --> 08:01.219
Mm, usually take
your coffee to go.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.744
How come you've been
drinking at the counter lately?

08:03.787 --> 08:06.268
You kicking me out, Elaine?No, no, no.

08:06.311 --> 08:09.358
Just wondering if maybe
you retired. [chuckles]

08:17.409 --> 08:18.541
Hey, hon.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.109
Hi.What can I
get for you?

08:21.152 --> 08:22.893
Well...

08:22.937 --> 08:25.156
According
to online reviews,

08:25.200 --> 08:28.508
I understand your specialties
are the...

08:28.551 --> 08:30.945
the chicken-fried steak
and the fresh-baked apple pie.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.381
Oh, you did your homework.

08:32.424 --> 08:33.991
I always do.

08:34.035 --> 08:36.080
But that being said,

08:36.124 --> 08:39.388
we know we can't always trust
what's on the Internet.

08:39.431 --> 08:42.304
So I prefer to ask regular,
real people.

08:44.306 --> 08:46.090
You look like real people.

08:46.134 --> 08:48.266
So what should I do?

08:48.310 --> 08:50.181
The steak or the pie?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.098
Coffee.

08:56.318 --> 08:57.493
Coffee.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.799
And a piece
of pie, please.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.278
Okay.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.891
I'm Marcie, by the way.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.285
Gibbs.

09:10.114 --> 09:13.596
So, you got a funky little place
here, Gibbs.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.555
I bet there's lots
of stories that go along

09:15.598 --> 09:18.079
with those plates
of bacon and eggs.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.908
You would know.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.346
How's that?

09:32.484 --> 09:34.486
So, what--
you don't like my picture?

09:35.966 --> 09:37.620
Oh, you don't
like my writing.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.405
I don't like being ambushed.

09:40.449 --> 09:41.668
Look,

09:41.711 --> 09:44.496
your bosses are refusing
to return my calls,

09:44.540 --> 09:46.760
so thought I'd go straight
to the source.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.029
Everything okay?[scoffs]

09:55.072 --> 09:57.640
Should have ordered the steak.

10:00.164 --> 10:03.211
75% alcohol. Wow, this
is the good stuff.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.647
Do you hear yourself, McGee?

10:04.691 --> 10:06.388
We are trained federal agents.

10:06.431 --> 10:07.781
BISHOP:
Trained federal agents

10:07.824 --> 10:10.000
who are lucky enough
to still have a job.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.828
You don't put peacocks
in cages.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.787
All right? They need
to show their feathers,

10:13.830 --> 10:15.005
they need to fly away.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.485
Peacocks don't really fly.

10:16.528 --> 10:19.053
They take, like, several
small leaps and a final hop.

10:19.096 --> 10:21.011
Okay, the point
is that we messed up.

10:21.055 --> 10:23.710
But we don't give up. This
is where we prove ourselves.

10:23.753 --> 10:27.017
Now, Sawyer was right.
We are the cool kids.

10:27.061 --> 10:30.107
Mm, were the cool kids.
Past tense.

10:30.151 --> 10:31.456
McGEE:
It could be worse,

10:31.500 --> 10:33.545
So let's do what Vance says

10:33.589 --> 10:34.851
and stick to these
assignments.

10:34.895 --> 10:38.202
Right. Which is why
I've taken the liberty

10:38.246 --> 10:41.902
of dividing up our pre-event
health and safety duties.

10:41.945 --> 10:44.339
Including site evaluation,

10:44.382 --> 10:46.428
sanitizer placement,

10:46.471 --> 10:48.343
and test and vaccine
verification

10:48.386 --> 10:50.345
for everyone on the guest list.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.651
SAWYER:
Team Gibbs is down

10:51.694 --> 10:52.695
with PPE?

10:52.739 --> 10:54.305
Sexy.

10:54.349 --> 10:57.744
Although not quite as sexy
as being down with...

10:57.787 --> 10:59.006
Springsteen.

10:59.049 --> 11:01.051
What?Bruce?

11:01.095 --> 11:03.793
And Gaga.
And Bono.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.100
Y-You did not meet
those people.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.841
I had to rule them out
as suspects.

11:07.884 --> 11:11.148
Don't worry, Tyler and I
have plenty of other leads.

11:11.192 --> 11:12.541
Such as?

11:12.584 --> 11:16.458
Sorry, that info
is for the A team only.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.025
Enjoy your stickers.

11:21.942 --> 11:25.162
My desk.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.818
Hey, Jimmy.Hey, Nick.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.864
I'm still working.Oh, no problem.

11:30.907 --> 11:33.910
But I can give you
what I have so far.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.477
Oh, okay.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.218
The victim is
ID'd as, uh,

11:37.261 --> 11:39.046
Marine Lance Corporal
Jesse Flint.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.830
You already knew that. Duh.Duh.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.745
Uh, time of death was
10:30 last night,

11:42.789 --> 11:44.181
so just before he was
found in the dumpster.

11:44.225 --> 11:46.662
And I confirmed that the
cause of death was in fact

11:46.706 --> 11:48.969
three gunshot wounds,
including the one to the head.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.492
Mm. Overkill.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.015
Funny. That's actually
what Agent Sawyer said

11:52.059 --> 11:54.365
at the crime...

11:54.409 --> 11:56.759
Wait a minute,
this isn't your case.

11:56.803 --> 11:57.978
And you're not here
for an update.

11:58.021 --> 12:00.197
What is this
on his hand and arm?

12:01.938 --> 12:03.244
Nick, you...

12:03.287 --> 12:06.073
Purple paint-- that's weird.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.817
Okay, Jimmy,
I'm here for a rapid test.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.428
Just couldn't help yourself,
could you?

12:13.471 --> 12:15.343
I get it, I do.

12:15.386 --> 12:17.998
A murder case
is way more interesting.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.827
Yeah, than a lame COVID
assignment? Hell yeah.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.830
Nick, health and safety
protocols might not be fun,

12:23.873 --> 12:27.616
but the consequences
of not enforcing them...

12:27.659 --> 12:29.052
can be tragic.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.445
Breena.
Of course.

12:30.488 --> 12:33.274
You're right, Jimmy.
I'm sorry.

12:33.317 --> 12:36.277
KASIE:
Honestly, Team Gibbs
should know better.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.627
They made their bed, and now
they have to lie in it.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.890
Yeah, I know. Still,
I feel kind of guilty.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.414
I mean, they just
look so... sad.

12:43.458 --> 12:46.330
Uh, hello?
Sitting right here.

12:46.374 --> 12:50.552
Oh, we know, but this lab
is a designated NPZ:

12:50.595 --> 12:52.510
no-pity zone.I'm not here for pity.

12:52.554 --> 12:53.903
I'm here because you have

12:53.947 --> 12:55.949
the only working labeler
in the building.

12:55.992 --> 12:58.473
[computer beeping]

12:58.516 --> 13:00.823
Looks like the paint
on your victim's body

13:00.867 --> 13:02.520
was number 7863.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.566
Blushing Eggplant.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.568
I hear that color is very in.

13:06.611 --> 13:10.441
Sorry. Not my case.
I'll be quiet.

13:10.485 --> 13:14.315
Well, I doubt our Marine was
up on the latest color trends.

13:14.358 --> 13:16.883
He was more of the, uh,
black and blue type.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.102
Lance Corporal Flint
was in the middle

13:19.146 --> 13:20.800
of a dishonorable discharge
for fighting

13:20.843 --> 13:22.714
and domestic abuse
against his girlfriend.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.412
Interesting.
You know, when you talk to her,

13:24.455 --> 13:25.543
you should, um...

13:28.111 --> 13:29.504
Sorry.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.604
Uh-uh.
You can't put that there.

13:42.647 --> 13:43.823
Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.695
I-I measured.
This is optimum distance

13:46.738 --> 13:48.131
between the wet bar
and the restrooms.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.307
It's also where
the secretary of defense

13:50.351 --> 13:53.136
is going to toast the Yemeni
foreign affairs minister,

13:53.180 --> 13:55.791
and the cheap plastic clashes
with the party decor.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.837
And, uh, you are?

13:57.880 --> 14:00.056
Miles Thatcher.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.666
One of SECDEF's personal aides.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.104
I was also aide to his
civilian predecessor.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.802
He would have noticed
my design choices.Where?

14:06.846 --> 14:09.065
Well, the whole patio.
We...

14:09.109 --> 14:11.894
are redecorating everything
for this event.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.635
No, no, no.
Uh, where do you want me

14:13.678 --> 14:14.766
to put the hand sanitizer?

14:14.810 --> 14:16.681
Figure it out.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.509
I'm sure it doesn't take
an advanced degree.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.250
Actually, I have two of those.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.557
Ah. Funny guy.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.390
NCIS was not
on the security list.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.479
Uh, I'm actually here
as a COVID officer,

14:31.522 --> 14:34.177
Mr. Al-Kamal,
and I hate to bother you,

14:34.221 --> 14:37.050
but your embassy has yet
to hand over test data

14:37.093 --> 14:40.227
and vaccine certifications.Yes.

14:40.270 --> 14:43.360
All guests need to file
paperwork with us

14:43.404 --> 14:45.841
before the event.Forgive me, but,

14:45.885 --> 14:49.062
you understand our reluctance
to trust sensitive medical data

14:49.105 --> 14:50.498
to the American
health care system.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.935
I do, I do.
It is not perfect.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.632
My co-pays are a fortune.

14:54.676 --> 14:57.940
Universal health care is
promised in our constitution.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.943
Yes, and I imagine it's hard
to deliver on that promise

15:00.987 --> 15:03.337
in the middle
of a deadly civil war.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.035
I lost my parents two years ago,

15:06.079 --> 15:08.168
and my brother last month.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.605
This summit is important.

15:10.648 --> 15:13.303
My apologies, Agent Bishop.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.696
I'll get you whatever you need.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.099
"Kamal" means perfection, right?

15:26.142 --> 15:29.711
Uh, sorry.
Old habits from boarding school.[chuckles]

15:29.754 --> 15:31.191
You should hear
what happened to kids

15:31.234 --> 15:32.627
who left wrinkles
in their bedsheets.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.368
Ah.You speak Arabic.

15:34.411 --> 15:35.978
Not bad for a COVID officer.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.285
[chuckles]

15:38.328 --> 15:42.637
And peacocks can fly.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.161
And according to this,
they don't fly far,

15:45.205 --> 15:48.860
but they can reach
ten miles per hour.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.688
Uh, if you say so.

15:50.732 --> 15:53.430
â™ª

16:01.047 --> 16:03.005
See, you're an artist.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.835
You feel my pain.
You can't just turn off talent.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.837
Hey, I'd much rather
be at a jazz club

16:08.880 --> 16:11.666
playing some Art Tatum,
but here I am,

16:11.709 --> 16:14.364
practicing John Tesh covers
for the Man.

16:14.408 --> 16:17.628
You know, sometimes
peacocks get put in cages.Yeah, you're telling me.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.195
And after having spent
the last year out of work,

16:19.239 --> 16:21.763
I'm just happy
for a paying gig, brother.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.808
Thanks for listening.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.549
Oh, I appreciate that, man.

16:25.593 --> 16:28.161
Hey, you know what.
Take a demo CD.What?

16:28.204 --> 16:29.901
Yeah, uh, the first track
is called

16:29.945 --> 16:31.816
"I'm Locked in a Cage,
Let Me Out."No.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.776
It's about taking mushrooms
on a airplane. [laughs]

16:34.819 --> 16:36.517
But, uh, it works
for your thing, too.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.040
Yeah.
[chuckles]

16:39.476 --> 16:42.653
3.9 GPA from Johns Hopkins
and MIT,

16:42.697 --> 16:45.613
all to put down stickers.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.006
Yeah, well, at least
you didn't insult

16:47.049 --> 16:48.311
the foreign minister's attachÃ©.

16:48.355 --> 16:52.576
And all I got
was a bad jazz trip.Hm.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.491
You know, I know I said
this assignment could be worse,

16:54.535 --> 16:55.927
but I don't see how.

16:55.971 --> 16:58.887
You got something
on your jacket.

16:58.930 --> 17:01.629
Oh, man.
It's paint.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.588
What is that, purple?No, that's not purple, that's...

17:04.632 --> 17:05.937
Blushing Eggplant.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.113
TORRES:
Wait, that was the same

17:07.156 --> 17:08.375
color paint as the one

17:08.418 --> 17:10.246
that was on the body in autopsy.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.815
Same as our murder victim?
That's quite the coincidence.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.339
Yeah.
It's probably nothing.

17:16.383 --> 17:21.214
Unless he was at SECDEF's
house before he was killed.

17:21.257 --> 17:24.130
Right.Because then we'd
have to assume

17:24.173 --> 17:26.523
it was connected to his death.

17:26.567 --> 17:27.916
Right.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.049
TORRES:
And we'd have to...

17:30.092 --> 17:32.007
investigate.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.054
This is not our case.
We can't do that.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.320
Right?

17:46.891 --> 17:49.938
BISHOP:
Our victim is Lance
Corporal Jesse Flint,

17:49.981 --> 17:52.158
and was soon to be
a former lance corporal

17:52.201 --> 17:53.768
thanks to his history
of violence.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.204
Bad Marine, bad dude.

17:55.248 --> 17:58.033
Yeah. So what was he doing
at SECDEF's house?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.122
Look, we don't know
if he was there for sure.

18:00.166 --> 18:03.125
He's not our victim
because it's not our case.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.518
It is now.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.172
Why, because we found
a little paint on him?

18:06.215 --> 18:07.129
Shh!Shh!

18:07.173 --> 18:09.000
You know sound carries in here.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.132
But don't worry,

18:10.176 --> 18:12.134
the paint is not a priority.

18:12.178 --> 18:15.050
The victim worked
as a handyman on the side.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.356
How did you get a clicker?

18:16.399 --> 18:18.662
By following Vance's orders.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.796
Like I was saying,
Lance Corporal Flint

18:21.839 --> 18:23.711
painted houses all over town.

18:23.754 --> 18:24.973
It's a coincidence.

18:26.235 --> 18:27.845
Agent Tyler and I

18:27.889 --> 18:29.456
already have a lead
on the killer.

18:29.499 --> 18:32.111
Seems the victim's
girlfriend skipped town.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.156
Seems suspicious, right?

18:34.200 --> 18:36.158
So stay the hell
out of our case,

18:36.202 --> 18:37.681
or I'm going to Vance.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.559
All right, I know we want to get
involved, but we got to drop it.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.387
You don't drop
a gut feeling, McGee.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.563
Last time, our gut
got us in trouble.

18:49.606 --> 18:52.174
Then we make sure
we get it right.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.353
Was this man
one of the painters?

18:57.397 --> 18:58.833
Did you hire him?

18:58.876 --> 19:01.183
What does this have to do with
health protocols?

19:01.227 --> 19:04.752
Look, you need us to sign off
on the safety of this event,

19:04.795 --> 19:07.929
so... we need answers.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.626
Yes.

19:09.670 --> 19:12.107
He was handing out leaflets
in front of the PX,

19:12.151 --> 19:13.848
and he begged me for a job.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.980
But, like everybody who steps
foot on the property,

19:16.024 --> 19:17.765
I verified that
he was vaccinated.

19:17.808 --> 19:21.116
I only wish
I'd verified his references.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.466
So there was a problem, or...No.

19:23.510 --> 19:26.382
But painting requires
an eye for detail.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.732
This guy
might as well be blind.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.821
Mm.You fired him?

19:30.865 --> 19:32.388
I didn't have to.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.564
Two hours into the job
he took a cell phone call

19:34.608 --> 19:36.044
and walked away.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.567
I never heard from him again.

19:37.611 --> 19:38.568
[audio feedback screeches]

19:38.612 --> 19:40.483
Ah, damn piano player.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.573
Excuse me.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.925
Hmm. Do you still think
we should drop it?

19:47.969 --> 19:49.579
Yeah.

19:49.623 --> 19:52.756
Our dead painter may have
been acting strange,

19:52.800 --> 19:54.410
but it still doesn't
prove anything.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.804
I say we go check out
his work van

19:56.847 --> 19:57.892
and see what he was up to.

19:57.935 --> 19:59.241
This is not our job.

19:59.285 --> 20:02.201
Not yet.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.726
Hey, guys.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.336
How's it going?

20:07.380 --> 20:08.772
Got an update, Palmer?

20:08.816 --> 20:10.034
Uh, no, no, no, no.

20:10.078 --> 20:11.775
So what are you doing here?

20:11.819 --> 20:14.604
Oh, that's right, yes.
I have a few questions for you.

20:14.648 --> 20:18.042
Uh, did you find
the victim's girlfriend?

20:18.086 --> 20:20.219
Did you find anything unusual
in his apartment or vehicle?

20:20.262 --> 20:22.960
And did you find
a computer or cell phone?

20:23.004 --> 20:25.398
You're not even
trying to hide it, are you?

20:28.879 --> 20:30.316
Team Gibbs sent you.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.361
Of course they did.
I'm trying to confirm

20:32.405 --> 20:34.015
the victim's COVID
contact tracing.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.538
Did the body test positive?

20:35.582 --> 20:38.324
Uh, no, no, but
as you said, uh,

20:38.367 --> 20:41.152
"He was painting houses
all over town."

20:41.196 --> 20:43.633
Yes. Why?

20:43.677 --> 20:45.853
Well, then, despite
a negative COVID test,

20:45.896 --> 20:47.420
his close relations
and/or possessions

20:47.463 --> 20:49.160
could have been exposed.

20:49.204 --> 20:52.033
What? Uh...
How?

20:52.076 --> 20:53.948
That's for the compliance
officer to determine.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.689
But in my medical opinion,

20:55.732 --> 20:58.300
we should just test all
the evidence. You know, just...

20:58.344 --> 21:00.171
just in case.This is absurd.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.912
Team Gibbs is just using you

21:01.956 --> 21:03.349
to nose into this case.

21:03.392 --> 21:06.482
Agent Sawyer, our job
is to help the team.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.919
Now, do your job.

21:13.707 --> 21:16.623
[phone ringing]

21:18.625 --> 21:20.322
Gibbs.

21:20.366 --> 21:23.020
Yeah, I-I'm glad
to get your call.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.761
I spoke with the IG.

21:24.805 --> 21:27.068
I think it's time
we talk next steps.

21:27.111 --> 21:29.113
I'm not calling
about that, Director.

21:29.157 --> 21:30.419
A reporter came to see me.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.856
I heard, uh, someone's
been asking questions.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.902
I hear someone's
not answering them.

21:37.992 --> 21:41.561
NCIS has been asked not
to comment on the story, Gibbs.

21:41.604 --> 21:44.128
There is no story.
Just truth.

21:44.172 --> 21:47.610
I agree. But the matter
has already been handled,

21:47.654 --> 21:49.220
internally and appropriately.

21:49.264 --> 21:51.135
Then tell them that.

21:51.179 --> 21:55.052
I refuse to publicly throw
one of my agents under the bus.

21:55.096 --> 21:56.967
I don't want protection.

21:57.011 --> 21:59.622
Yeah, you've made that
perfectly clear.

21:59.666 --> 22:02.495
Between beating a man half to
death and refusing to apologize,

22:02.538 --> 22:05.324
I seem to be the only one
saving you from yourself.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.064
And quite frankly, Gibbs,

22:07.108 --> 22:08.370
I'm getting tired of it.

22:08.414 --> 22:09.806
Yeah?
Then stop.

22:13.723 --> 22:16.422
Hey, Luce?
Come on.

22:16.465 --> 22:17.858
Lunch.

22:24.473 --> 22:27.084
Well, that's everything.

22:27.128 --> 22:32.002
No evidence in the murder case,
and no damn COVID.

22:32.046 --> 22:33.700
Happy now?Mm.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.745
[phone rings]

22:38.618 --> 22:39.793
Yeah, Tyler.

22:39.836 --> 22:42.491
[Tyler speaking indistinctly]

22:42.535 --> 22:43.971
On my way.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.714
We found the
missing girlfriend.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.977
I'll make sure to get
her contact tracing history.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.066
[grunts]

22:52.109 --> 22:53.937
You didn't answer his question.

22:53.981 --> 22:55.765
Are you happy now?No.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.506
And why not?For starters,

22:57.550 --> 23:01.336
what was our handyman
doing with hypodermic needles

23:01.380 --> 23:03.120
in his work van, hmm?

23:03.164 --> 23:05.775
Don't know.
Mixing paint colors?

23:05.819 --> 23:08.212
You know, that was Sawyer's
theory, but our dead guy

23:08.256 --> 23:09.736
was not a
paint wizard.

23:09.779 --> 23:14.393
So, can you please
run the needles, Kase?

23:14.436 --> 23:17.657
Of course. I'll have the results
to you by the end of the week.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.397
That long?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.311
My plate is full.

23:20.355 --> 23:21.530
When you aren't the lead agents,

23:21.574 --> 23:23.619
your stuff
goes to the bottom of the pile.

23:23.663 --> 23:26.535
Okay.There are other agents
in this building.

23:26.579 --> 23:30.104
And as annoying as some
of those agents may be...

23:30.147 --> 23:31.758
we're a team.

23:31.801 --> 23:34.804
Which is why
you should look at this.

23:38.025 --> 23:40.288
Somebody wrote down
a paint code.

23:40.331 --> 23:42.029
9949.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.596
Jade Garden?

23:43.639 --> 23:46.947
It's not in any
of these paint catalogues.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.078
Custom color?

23:48.122 --> 23:49.863
Or a street
address?

23:49.906 --> 23:53.823
Garden could be a street suffix,
like court or lane.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.869
Which would mean the lead agents
missed a clue.

23:55.912 --> 23:57.523
Mm. That's what
I'm saying.

23:57.566 --> 24:01.483
Okay, but your stuff still goes
to the bottom of the pile.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.921
Are you sure this is
9949 Jade Garden?

24:04.965 --> 24:06.183
Yep.

24:07.228 --> 24:09.622
Federal agents.
Hello?

24:12.189 --> 24:13.756
No power.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.237
Ah.
Yes there is.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.590
I am
completely

24:21.634 --> 24:23.636
flashing back to my days
doing musical theatre.

24:23.679 --> 24:25.289
Ooh. Godspell.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.117
[chuckles]
Please sing.

24:27.161 --> 24:30.077
Forgot the words.Ah.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.600
Wonder what our, uh,
handyman was doing

24:31.644 --> 24:33.036
with the address of this place.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.909
Mm, maybe
another side job?

24:35.952 --> 24:38.172
What did, uh,
Agent Tyler think?

24:38.215 --> 24:40.304
Are they meeting
us here, or...

24:40.348 --> 24:42.002
Uh...

24:42.045 --> 24:43.786
Are you s... Really?
You didn't call them?

24:43.830 --> 24:47.529
Okay, McGee, we were waiting
to find something more relevant.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.183
Hey, yo.

24:49.226 --> 24:50.967
I think we just did.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.499
What is all this?

25:02.109 --> 25:04.503
BISHOP:
I recognize this place.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.287
McGEE:
All these photos are
from SECDEF's house.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.724
TORRES:
Yeah, the handyman wasn't
painting the house.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.204
He was casing
the joint.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.553
For what?

25:11.597 --> 25:14.251
Something he wanted
to keep secret.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.950
Nobody move.

25:28.918 --> 25:30.920
This place is wired to blow.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.538
[indistinct radio chatter]

25:39.581 --> 25:41.409
Director.Gentlemen.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.282
Well, you've been busy.

25:45.326 --> 25:48.242
How'd the COVID officers
end up defusing bombs?

25:48.285 --> 25:50.679
Well, sir, during the, uh,
course of our assignment,

25:50.723 --> 25:53.073
we discovered
that SECDEF McClane's house

25:53.116 --> 25:55.466
had recently been painted
by our murder victim.

25:55.510 --> 25:58.557
A bad color to match a bad guy.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.210
Yes, I read the file.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.778
Lance Corporal Flint
had a history of violence.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.258
And we wanted
to make sure his murder

26:04.301 --> 26:06.129
didn't pose a security threat
to the summit.

26:06.173 --> 26:07.957
VANCE: Hmm.So we investigated.

26:08.001 --> 26:10.394
And?
Does it pose a threat?

26:10.438 --> 26:11.787
Oh, more than we knew.

26:11.831 --> 26:14.007
We-we found weapons, phony IDs,

26:14.050 --> 26:16.183
even, uh, an offshore bank
account with $100,000 in it.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.663
BISHOP:
We also

26:17.706 --> 26:21.797
found, uh, surveillance photos,
all of SECDEF McClane.

26:21.841 --> 26:25.627
We believe the murder victim
was also a hit man.

26:25.671 --> 26:28.456
And SECDEF was his next target.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.893
Thankfully, they were never
at the house at the same time.

26:30.937 --> 26:32.634
So who hired
this hit man?

26:32.678 --> 26:34.636
And is the hit still active?

26:34.680 --> 26:36.159
Well, we don't know yet.

26:36.203 --> 26:37.770
But we are on it, Director.

26:37.813 --> 26:39.685
No, you're not.

26:39.728 --> 26:42.949
As much as I appreciate your
carefully-worded explanation,

26:42.992 --> 26:47.127
this team has once again
overstepped bounds.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.303
Where are Agents
Tyler and Sawyer?BISHOP: We were planning

26:49.346 --> 26:51.392
on sharing everything
that we found with them, sir.

26:51.435 --> 26:54.743
Yes. You're also going to follow
their orders from here on out.

26:54.787 --> 26:57.093
They still
have lead.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.268
Understood?

27:02.751 --> 27:04.144
TYLER:
We found the victim's
girlfriend.

27:04.187 --> 27:07.016
Turns out she has an alibi,
so-- not our killer.

27:07.060 --> 27:10.019
But we did get into Flint's
encrypted email account.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.326
TYLER:
He exchanged messages

27:12.369 --> 27:14.241
with whoever hired
him to kill SECDEF.

27:14.284 --> 27:16.286
Still nothing
to identify that person,

27:16.330 --> 27:19.159
but the emails show Flint
was blackmailing his employer.

27:19.202 --> 27:22.553
BISHOP:
"If you want to stay anonymous,
I want more money."

27:22.597 --> 27:23.859
Could be motive for murder.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.426
So you think
whoever hired the hit man

27:25.469 --> 27:26.688
also killed him.

27:26.732 --> 27:27.907
That makes sense.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.735
SAWYER:
What we really need is a list

27:29.778 --> 27:31.345
of who wants SECDEF dead.

27:31.388 --> 27:33.956
You know, background stuff.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.741
Computer stuff.

27:35.784 --> 27:36.742
Nerd stuff.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.526
You got a problem with that?Yes.

27:38.569 --> 27:40.571
SECDEF's life is in danger
and you're playing petty games.

27:40.615 --> 27:42.399
Oh, I'm not playing games.

27:42.443 --> 27:44.401
I simply don't trust you.

27:44.445 --> 27:46.490
What the hell
do you want from us?

27:46.534 --> 27:48.928
I want you to stop screwing up.Whoa. Sawyer.

27:48.971 --> 27:52.018
NCIS is a team.

27:52.061 --> 27:55.848
And when you screw up,
it makes us all look bad.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.249
[knocking on door]

28:06.293 --> 28:08.295
Lucy, stay.

28:19.045 --> 28:20.742
I come bearing gifts.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.352
A peace offering.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.180
It's a steak.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.096
Maybe.

28:27.140 --> 28:29.055
No, it's not.

28:30.143 --> 28:32.014
I was never
given the opportunity

28:32.058 --> 28:34.930
to explain myself
at the diner the other day.

28:34.974 --> 28:37.106
First, that was not an act.

28:37.150 --> 28:39.108
And it certainly
was not an ambush.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.980
That's not who I am.

28:41.023 --> 28:44.940
I was merely trying
to work my way up into a...

28:44.984 --> 28:48.639
a very nice introduction
by use of a little small talk.

28:48.683 --> 28:51.077
But by then,
it was too late, so...

28:51.120 --> 28:52.948
here I am.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.735
Why?

28:56.778 --> 28:58.214
Because I want
to give you something

28:58.258 --> 29:00.390
more than just this steak.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.003
[sighs]

29:05.918 --> 29:08.007
Ignore the loquacious patron
from the diner and just...

29:08.050 --> 29:10.531
just read my work.

29:10.574 --> 29:14.230
There are newspaper articles
and magazine columns.

29:14.274 --> 29:17.190
But what I am most proud of
is my investigative work.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.887
Which is about
exposing the truth.

29:18.931 --> 29:21.629
And I know you know something
about the truth,

29:21.672 --> 29:23.805
and I want to be the one
to write about it.

29:25.807 --> 29:28.201
Because that's who I am.

29:37.645 --> 29:40.213
In that case, I, uh...

29:40.256 --> 29:42.258
I thank you for your time.

29:42.302 --> 29:45.348
Enjoy the... whatever that is,

29:45.392 --> 29:47.916
and good luck
on your boat engine.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.049
Wait, wait.
My what?

29:50.092 --> 29:51.790
Your boat...

29:51.833 --> 29:54.967
That's a carburetor
for a Graymarine Phantom, right?

29:57.752 --> 30:00.624
I hear they're
a pain in the ass.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.851
Are you waiting
to see Secretary McClane?

30:09.895 --> 30:13.115
Yes. He's inside, uh, meeting
with his security detail.

30:13.159 --> 30:16.249
My embassy was informed
of the threat on his life.

30:16.292 --> 30:18.686
I'm afraid the summit
must be cancelled.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.557
Maybe it can happen
another time?

30:21.907 --> 30:23.865
A foreign minister
meeting on U.S. soil

30:23.909 --> 30:26.389
has already caused
outcry back home.

30:26.433 --> 30:29.523
The chances of it
happening again are very small.

30:29.566 --> 30:30.654
[door opens]I'm sorry.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.656
So am I, Agent Bishop.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.964
With my would-be assassin dead,

30:36.008 --> 30:38.575
I was hoping that the threat
had been neutralized.

30:38.619 --> 30:39.968
We still have to find
whoever hired him, sir.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.187
That's why I'm here.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.406
What, to ask me
about my enemies?

30:43.450 --> 30:44.494
[chuckles]

30:44.538 --> 30:46.061
That could take a while.

30:46.105 --> 30:47.497
Would you excuse
us, please?

30:47.541 --> 30:49.891
I understand.
Mr. Secretary.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.719
Thank you.

30:51.762 --> 30:53.286
Please.

30:53.329 --> 30:54.983
Ah.
Thank you.

30:55.027 --> 30:57.420
Well...

30:57.464 --> 31:00.597
there goes any chance
of real progress.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.387
They're kidney meds,
Agent Bishop.

31:07.430 --> 31:11.043
Damn stress will probably kill
me long before any assassin.[chuckles]

31:16.526 --> 31:19.573
Vital foreign policy decisions
should not be determined

31:19.616 --> 31:22.489
by a bunch
of damn Internet crazies.

31:22.532 --> 31:24.970
Sounds like you know
who's behind this.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.146
No. No, I...

31:27.189 --> 31:29.975
Look, just forget
I said anything.

31:30.018 --> 31:32.586
Even if it means a chance
at saving your summit?

31:38.679 --> 31:41.290
I made a bad call ten years ago.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.511
It was a mistake

31:44.554 --> 31:47.427
that I deeply regret.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.646
McGEE:
SECDEF wasn't kidding.
This was a bad call.

31:49.690 --> 31:51.431
There was, uh,
an Al-Qaeda standoff

31:51.474 --> 31:53.824
near an Iraqi oil refinery.

31:53.868 --> 31:56.305
And rather than
try and negotiate,

31:56.349 --> 31:59.613
General McClane
took a different approach.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.093
All hell broke loose
and the refinery

32:01.136 --> 32:02.964
burned to the ground.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.357
Do people want him dead
for this?

32:04.400 --> 32:05.924
There's this online
community that thinks

32:05.967 --> 32:07.751
the incident
is some kind of

32:07.795 --> 32:09.579
massive conspiracy.

32:09.623 --> 32:12.017
SECDEF "purposely
destroyed the refinery

32:12.060 --> 32:14.933
to cover up his secret
ties to oil barons."

32:14.976 --> 32:18.197
Radical user groups
have been posting death threats.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.720
Gives us a lot of suspects.

32:19.763 --> 32:21.940
Oh, I think
I can help with that.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.855
BISHOP:
You listened
to the piano player's demo CD?

32:24.899 --> 32:27.380
I did more than listen.
Check your email.

32:27.423 --> 32:29.077
Hmm.

32:29.121 --> 32:31.514
Security records
for the summit.

32:31.558 --> 32:34.300
You reran the entire guest list.

32:34.343 --> 32:36.780
I was looking for red flags.You find any?

32:36.824 --> 32:38.391
Yeah.
The last name on this CD

32:38.434 --> 32:39.870
doesn't match the one
on the list.

32:42.134 --> 32:45.746
Kendle Spotnitz is actually
Kendle Radcliffe.

32:45.789 --> 32:47.226
Why would he use
a phony ID?

32:47.269 --> 32:49.097
Because the piano player

32:49.141 --> 32:51.012
has a rap sheet
for drug possession.

32:51.056 --> 32:52.361
He would have failed
the background check.

32:52.405 --> 32:53.580
Nice catch.

32:53.623 --> 32:54.885
You did all this on your own?

32:54.929 --> 32:57.410
Oh, hell no.
I practically begged the, uh...

32:57.453 --> 32:59.542
cyber crime unit.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.022
Damn, you
nerded hard.

33:01.066 --> 33:02.502
I nerded real hard.

33:02.545 --> 33:04.591
Okay, hang on.
Check this out.

33:04.634 --> 33:07.681
Piano player talked to
our Internet crazies.

33:07.724 --> 33:09.900
And he seemed to hate the Man.

33:09.944 --> 33:11.467
I think that's motive.

33:11.511 --> 33:12.903
Well, let's ask him.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.731
Okay, okay.

33:14.775 --> 33:17.908
Now, we can't go anywhere until
we talk to Tyler and Sawyer.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.693
Hold on, hold on.[dialing]

33:19.736 --> 33:21.216
[line ringing]

33:24.002 --> 33:25.220
No answer.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.832
We should call Agent Tyler again
just in case.

33:28.876 --> 33:30.965
Don't bother. We can
handle a jazz musician.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.401
Okay.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.406
Federal agents.[glass shatters inside]

33:39.626 --> 33:40.714
NCIS!

33:41.758 --> 33:43.064
SAWYER:
Whoa!

33:43.108 --> 33:44.457
Easy.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.980
It's just us.

33:47.721 --> 33:49.636
Didn't you see the cop outside?

33:49.679 --> 33:51.333
No, there was no cop outside.

33:51.377 --> 33:52.856
We heard a crash.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.423
I dropped a dish.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.295
Where's Kendle?Relax.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.253
He's not going anywhere.

34:06.348 --> 34:08.089
He was dead when we found him.

34:08.133 --> 34:09.960
What happened?

34:10.004 --> 34:11.658
I have a better question.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.530
What the hell are you two
even doing here?

34:22.930 --> 34:25.106
We traced the earlier emails
to an IP address

34:25.150 --> 34:26.760
at the piano player's apartment.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.588
That's how we
beat you there.

34:29.676 --> 34:30.851
Sorry.

34:30.894 --> 34:32.896
When we arrived,
we found Kendle Radcliffe

34:32.940 --> 34:35.464
dead in his bathtub,
single intraoral gunshot wound.

34:35.508 --> 34:37.510
GSR on his hand
says suicide.

34:37.553 --> 34:39.294
We then found
a laptop containing

34:39.338 --> 34:41.688
the same blackmail messages
from our hitman.

34:41.731 --> 34:44.256
So the piano player
hired the hitman,

34:44.299 --> 34:46.432
killed the hitman,
and then killed himself.

34:46.475 --> 34:48.260
The Glock used in the suicide
was a match

34:48.303 --> 34:49.652
to the murder weapon.

34:49.696 --> 34:52.612
Which means the dead
piano player is our killer.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.222
Case closed.

34:54.266 --> 34:56.790
SECDEF's event is
back on for tonight.

35:00.968 --> 35:03.971
This is the part
where you congratulate us.

35:04.014 --> 35:05.494
Where do you think
the piano player

35:05.538 --> 35:07.148
got the money
to hire a hitman?

35:07.192 --> 35:09.194
He hasn't worked for a year.

35:09.237 --> 35:11.283
And why kill himself?

35:11.326 --> 35:15.200
You said the guy used a fake ID
to get the gig at SECDEF's.

35:15.243 --> 35:18.333
He knew it was only a matter
of time until we found out.

35:18.377 --> 35:19.378
And what about the money?

35:19.421 --> 35:21.249
We suspect he crowdsourced it

35:21.293 --> 35:23.425
from his fellow
Internet crazies.

35:23.469 --> 35:25.862
I don't know. Seems
kind of convenient.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.386
Yeah, a little
too convenient.

35:27.429 --> 35:28.517
SAWYER:
I don't believe this.

35:28.561 --> 35:29.605
There is no evidence

35:29.649 --> 35:30.737
that the hit is still active

35:30.780 --> 35:32.695
and everyone involved is dead.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.654
What more do you want?

35:34.697 --> 35:37.570
It just feels like
we're missing something.

35:37.613 --> 35:40.138
Do you have anything
to prove that?

35:40.181 --> 35:42.792
Other than some gut feeling?

35:45.926 --> 35:47.057
Then it's over.

35:49.364 --> 35:50.670
TYLER:
Well, unless...

35:51.758 --> 35:54.413
Unless your feeling's
strong enough to call Vance.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.596
No.
Congrats on the win.

36:06.076 --> 36:08.209
Guys, we did the right thing.

36:08.253 --> 36:10.168
Then why does it
feel so wrong?

36:10.211 --> 36:12.213
Thought I said
this was a no-pity zone.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.084
What are y'all doing in here?

36:14.128 --> 36:15.260
We have a gut feeling.

36:15.303 --> 36:16.565
You mean the feeling

36:16.609 --> 36:17.914
that something doesn't add up

36:17.958 --> 36:20.090
and the answer
is staring us in the face?

36:20.134 --> 36:21.179
Yeah, how'd you know?

36:21.222 --> 36:23.050
Because I have
the same feeling.

36:23.093 --> 36:26.053
I've been processing evidence
from the suicide scene.

36:26.096 --> 36:27.272
Please tell us
you got something.

36:27.315 --> 36:29.230
Like last-minute evidence

36:29.274 --> 36:31.232
that could crack
this case wide open?

36:31.276 --> 36:32.407
Uh, yeah.Yes, no,

36:32.451 --> 36:33.321
Yes, yes.you got something like that?

36:33.365 --> 36:34.844
Well, I don't.

36:34.888 --> 36:37.673
Everything so far points
to murder, then suicide.Hmm.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.066
Sorry.[computer beeps]

36:41.329 --> 36:43.288
What's that,
Kase-- a break?

36:43.331 --> 36:44.854
KASIE:
Cork and potassium.

36:44.898 --> 36:46.204
And what is that?

36:46.247 --> 36:47.988
I was finally able to process

36:48.031 --> 36:49.903
the syringes
from the hit man van,

36:49.946 --> 36:51.296
but the results only show

36:51.339 --> 36:53.994
compressed cork
and liquid potassium.

36:54.037 --> 36:55.213
Not exactly helpful.

36:55.256 --> 36:56.953
Cork is used in everything

36:56.997 --> 36:58.999
from bulletin boards
to wine bottles.

36:59.042 --> 37:01.001
And liquid potassium
is harmless.

37:01.044 --> 37:02.350
Well, it was a nice try.

37:02.394 --> 37:05.353
Unless you have
a kidney condition.

37:05.397 --> 37:06.572
What's that?

37:06.615 --> 37:09.270
Potassium is harmless

37:09.314 --> 37:10.837
unless you have
a kidney condition,

37:10.880 --> 37:14.014
and SECDEF McClane
takes kidney meds.

37:14.057 --> 37:17.235
Then these levels of potassium
would send his system into shock

37:17.278 --> 37:19.062
and he'd be dead within minutes.

37:19.106 --> 37:21.108
Did the hit man
plan to inject him?

37:21.151 --> 37:23.589
But that doesn't
explain the cork.

37:23.632 --> 37:26.200
Unless the hit man
injected something else.

37:27.201 --> 37:29.203
â™ª [indistinct chatter]

37:32.598 --> 37:35.905
Uh, if I could have
everyone's attention, please.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.865
Thank you.

37:38.908 --> 37:40.997
In a time of great distancing--

37:41.041 --> 37:43.783
both physically
and politically--

37:43.826 --> 37:47.090
it's important
that we come together now

37:47.134 --> 37:48.091
more than ever,

37:48.135 --> 37:49.919
both as friends

37:49.963 --> 37:51.399
and allies.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.140
[translating]

37:58.624 --> 38:00.713
Did you stop the toast?Hang on,
slow down.

38:00.756 --> 38:01.888
We checked every bottle
of champagne.

38:01.931 --> 38:02.932
There were no signs
of tampering.

38:02.976 --> 38:04.456
Yeah, we told you
there wouldn't be.

38:04.499 --> 38:05.979
A tiny needle prick.[sighs]

38:06.022 --> 38:07.763
This is crazy.

38:07.807 --> 38:09.330
You're just the COVID officers.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.375
We're federal agents.

38:10.418 --> 38:13.291
So please join me
in raising a glass

38:13.334 --> 38:14.770
to our renewed partnership

38:14.814 --> 38:16.294
and to peace.

38:17.425 --> 38:18.905
NCIS!
Do not move!

38:18.948 --> 38:20.515
Everybody put your
glasses down.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.952
Mister Secretary,
do not drink that!

38:22.996 --> 38:24.258
[crowd murmuring]

38:30.395 --> 38:32.397
[speaking Arabic]Please, Minister, wait.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.269
I assure you this is
all a misunderstanding.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.141
[both speaking Arabic]

38:40.840 --> 38:42.668
Thank you.

38:42.711 --> 38:43.973
I sure hope you have a
good explanation for this,

38:44.017 --> 38:45.018
Agent McGee.

38:45.061 --> 38:47.412
So do I, sir.

38:47.455 --> 38:49.979
Now, if we're right, the strip
should turn bright red.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.286
Right about what?McGEE: Potassium.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.985
Deadly to someone
with a chronic kidney condition.

38:56.029 --> 38:57.073
[translates in Arabic]

39:04.342 --> 39:06.126
I'll be damned.

39:07.301 --> 39:10.086
How the hell's a piano player
know my medical history?

39:10.130 --> 39:11.131
He didn't.

39:11.174 --> 39:12.959
Someone else was behind this.

39:13.002 --> 39:16.441
Someone who had access
to security records.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.227
Is this some sort of joke,
Agent Bishop?

39:20.270 --> 39:22.011
You have some explaining to do.

39:32.805 --> 39:35.895
TYLER:
Nasser Al-Kamal hired
a hit man to kill SECDEF,

39:35.938 --> 39:37.984
but not for what
happened in the past.

39:38.027 --> 39:39.986
For what was about to happen.

39:40.029 --> 39:42.989
Mm-hmm. A U.S. alliance
with his country.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.120
SAWYER:
As it turns out,

39:44.164 --> 39:45.687
Mister Al-Kamal
was part of a Yemeni

39:45.731 --> 39:47.515
nationalist group online.

39:47.559 --> 39:50.300
They have Internet crazies, too.

39:50.344 --> 39:52.738
But when the hit man
threatened to expose Kamal,

39:52.781 --> 39:54.914
Kamal killed him.

39:54.957 --> 39:58.004
Then set up the piano player
to take the fall.

39:58.047 --> 39:59.962
Hardly seems worth the trouble.

40:00.006 --> 40:02.487
I mean, why not just
try to kill me himself?

40:02.530 --> 40:04.184
Plausible deniability, sir.

40:05.228 --> 40:08.884
Well, it's a good thing NCIS
had their top team on the case.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.452
So...

40:11.496 --> 40:12.671
how'd you crack it?

40:12.714 --> 40:14.629
When we found
the piano player dead,

40:14.673 --> 40:16.414
his apartment was a mess.

40:17.980 --> 40:20.069
All except for the towels.

40:20.113 --> 40:22.202
We learned that
Mr. Al-Kamal is very OCD

40:22.245 --> 40:23.812
with wrinkles.

40:23.856 --> 40:27.163
And you ran the towels
for touch DNA.

40:27.207 --> 40:28.904
So you confirmed all this

40:28.948 --> 40:31.080
before you sent the other team
to crash the party?

40:31.124 --> 40:33.082
Not exactly, Director.

40:33.126 --> 40:35.476
It was more of a gut feeling.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.130
Whose gut feeling?

40:42.527 --> 40:44.137
BISHOP:
Ah, thanks, Todd.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.532
You think Todd knows?

40:47.575 --> 40:49.011
What, that we saved SECDEF

40:49.055 --> 40:50.926
or that we let Tyler and Sawyer
take the credit?

40:50.970 --> 40:52.493
SAWYER:
All of it.

40:53.581 --> 40:55.104
But...

40:55.148 --> 40:57.106
we are a team, right?

40:59.457 --> 41:00.762
Thanks, Ronnie.

41:00.806 --> 41:02.851
No, thank you.

41:02.895 --> 41:04.723
And also...

41:04.766 --> 41:06.376
we're sorry.

41:06.420 --> 41:08.553
TYLER:
Vance mentioned
this morning's news.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.119
We read the article.

41:10.163 --> 41:11.686
What article?

41:12.731 --> 41:15.037
Paper ran a story on Gibbs.

41:16.865 --> 41:18.345
What about him?

41:18.388 --> 41:20.652
Well, your team
is not mentioned,

41:20.695 --> 41:22.392
but everything else is.

41:22.436 --> 41:24.612
The attack,
the investigation,

41:24.656 --> 41:25.918
his confession.

41:27.310 --> 41:29.356
How bad is it, McGee?

41:29.399 --> 41:30.662
You know what,
it's really accurate.

41:30.705 --> 41:33.099
Everything Gibbs said
and-and did is...

41:33.142 --> 41:34.970
is in here almost word-for-word.

41:35.014 --> 41:36.972
There's no way a reporter
would know all of this.

41:37.016 --> 41:38.800
Unless...

41:38.844 --> 41:41.020
someone talked.

41:43.152 --> 41:44.676
Don't look at me.

41:51.291 --> 41:52.814
GIBBS:
Director.

41:53.859 --> 41:55.338
Want a drink?

41:56.688 --> 41:58.733
I won't be here that long.

41:58.777 --> 42:00.822
You talked to the reporter.

42:02.650 --> 42:04.565
I only told the truth.

42:04.609 --> 42:05.653
Yes.

42:05.697 --> 42:08.351
That's not
why I'm here.

42:08.395 --> 42:11.093
I came here to tell you,
face-to-face...

42:13.313 --> 42:15.576
...whatever comes
of this story,

42:15.620 --> 42:18.318
whatever happens
next, Gibbs...
