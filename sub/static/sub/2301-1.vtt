00:18.619 --> 00:22.622
I guess I'm
the first one to do this.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.623
Well, I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to say.

00:26.093 --> 00:27.527
I'm now a wife.

00:28.495 --> 00:31.030
Okay,
wedding video.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.202
Let me introduce you
to our delicious food.

00:36.203 --> 00:39.071
We got veggie korma,

00:39.072 --> 00:40.072
lamb curry, samosas.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.582
Oh, I am sitting
inside a tent of sorts,

00:46.346 --> 00:47.747
because it is inside a tent

00:47.748 --> 00:49.268
similar to this one
where you proposed.

00:51.451 --> 00:52.718
For our first date,

00:52.719 --> 00:54.787
Bea chose an Indian restaurant,

00:54.788 --> 00:58.057
you know, one of
those little places
on Sixth Street

00:58.058 --> 01:01.494
with the colored lights
and the fiber-optic lamps.

01:01.495 --> 01:04.596
Yum, except that
halfway through the meal,

01:04.598 --> 01:06.832
I start feeling
my stomach gurgle

01:06.833 --> 01:09.368
in this horrible
food-poisoning-type way,

01:09.369 --> 01:11.470
and I didn't even
have time to lie to her.

01:11.471 --> 01:14.006
I spend 20 minutes
in the dirty
restaurant toilet

01:14.007 --> 01:16.842
and the rest of the night
on Bea's bathroom floor,

01:16.843 --> 01:19.478
because I couldn't make it
to the subway,

01:19.479 --> 01:20.479
let alone Brooklyn.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.647
Well, we'd been planning

01:21.648 --> 01:23.482
on going camping upstate
for weeks,

01:23.483 --> 01:24.603
but, as you know,
I got sick,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.255
so we couldn't go.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.324
I thought you were upset,

01:31.325 --> 01:34.393
because you were
acting really weird,

01:34.394 --> 01:36.034
but then you... you built,
like, this tent

01:38.565 --> 01:41.267
over our bed out of blankets,

01:41.268 --> 01:43.602
and we made s'mores
on the stove,

01:43.604 --> 01:45.805
and then inside the fort
on our bed,

01:45.806 --> 01:47.686
you said, "Bea, this was
supposed to be romantic

01:51.111 --> 01:52.391
"and under the stars,
not sheets,

01:55.082 --> 01:57.416
"but you make me the happiest.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.885
Will you marry me?"

02:01.355 --> 02:02.655
And now we're married.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.525
So this, this is our,
"Fuck you, Indian food."

02:11.465 --> 02:13.199
You tried to keep us apart,

02:15.302 --> 02:17.269
but fuck you.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.571
We win.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.941
So we didn't get
a regular wedding cake.

02:21.942 --> 02:25.378
We decided on something
that was special
for us instead.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.313
Mm-hmm, special

02:27.314 --> 02:28.914
and cheap.
What?

02:28.915 --> 02:29.995
No,
I think some people

02:31.284 --> 02:32.752
are annoyed by no cake.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.654
Who cares?

02:34.655 --> 02:36.288
It's our wedding,

02:36.289 --> 02:37.690
huh?

02:37.691 --> 02:39.025
Before, I was alone,

02:41.528 --> 02:43.029
but now I'm not.

02:53.306 --> 02:55.741
I love you,
honeybee.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.324
Whew.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.697
It's not fancy.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.200
Is it okay?

03:21.201 --> 03:22.902
Do you like it?

03:26.206 --> 03:29.375
Here's what I see...

03:29.376 --> 03:31.110
<i>ot the city,</i>

03:31.111 --> 03:32.545
woods.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.780
Mm-hmm. I just want
it to be perfect.

03:34.781 --> 03:36.382
And I just want to be with you.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.917
Blehh!

03:37.918 --> 03:39.685
All right, come on.

03:39.686 --> 03:43.222
So this is the famous
family cottage.

03:56.436 --> 03:58.838
Mm.
Wait, wait, wait.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.773
What? What? What? What?
Not so fast, okay?

04:00.774 --> 04:02.541
First,
the grand tour.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.977
So this is the living room.

04:04.978 --> 04:05.978
Watch your step.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.514
You may notice a slight tilt.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.316
Uh-huh. This is
definitely unsafe.

04:10.317 --> 04:11.851
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're unsafe.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.786
You're unsafe.
You're unsafe.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.187
Here we have a TV
and VCR from 1991.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.392
Uh-huh.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.662
Well, I mean,
who needs cell service

04:23.663 --> 04:25.931
or Internet
when you can keep busy

04:25.932 --> 04:27.212
watching your favorite VHS tape?

04:30.971 --> 04:33.539
Over here,
we have the kitchen,

04:33.540 --> 04:37.343
complete with, yes,
a radioactive microwave

04:37.344 --> 04:40.779
and an oven that probably
still uses hot coals.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.748
You may be noticing a theme.

04:42.749 --> 04:43.749
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.218
I want to have sex with you.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.653
Bzz. Change is bad.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.290
Looks like a sign.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.359
No, looks like bad wiring.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.660
Yeah.

04:54.661 --> 04:55.861
This is the bear room.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.532
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.233
Very good.
Yeah.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.501
And, uh...

05:02.502 --> 05:04.970
why is it called the bear room?

05:04.971 --> 05:06.005
No.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.441
This is the bathroom.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.277
It's green,

05:11.278 --> 05:13.712
very green.

05:13.713 --> 05:15.247
This is, uh...

05:15.248 --> 05:18.417
This is where
you almost drowned
playing submarine.

05:18.418 --> 05:19.985
Yeah.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.020
Huh.
Yeah.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.555
You're my favorite.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.081
Which one is ours?

05:50.350 --> 05:51.784
Mm, next door.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.054
The woods room...
Right.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.356
Because it has windows

05:57.357 --> 05:59.658
facing...

05:59.659 --> 06:01.293
the woods.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.729
It's dark and scary out there.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.467
It's dark and scary in here.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.835
What's with the ducks?

06:42.836 --> 06:46.505
Ah, they're fake and hollow,
empty inside.

06:46.506 --> 06:49.108
I used to hide things
in 'em with I was little.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.109
Oh?

06:50.110 --> 06:51.443
Yeah.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.345
What are you hiding under here?

06:53.346 --> 06:54.946
My very superspecial
honeymoon nightgown.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.922
I love you, honeybee.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.761
Mm, bzz.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.461
Hmm.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.763
Sorry.

07:44.764 --> 07:45.798
Sorry.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.766
You are pretty creepo.

07:47.767 --> 07:50.536
I was done sleeping.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.171
Look what I found.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.307
Mm.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.582
"Dear ducks,

08:03.583 --> 08:05.718
"my name is
Mallard P. Quack.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.554
"I am not a real duck.
Stay away.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.956
Quack, quack..."

08:10.957 --> 08:14.193
Honk, quack, quack,
quack, honk.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.529
Did we get milk?

08:19.733 --> 08:20.933
You put it in here, right?

08:20.934 --> 08:22.534
Yeah, no,
it's in the fridge.

08:23.770 --> 08:24.870
Now, then... Hey.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.338
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.706
Hey, wife...

08:27.707 --> 08:29.708
Oh, how gracious
of you, husband.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.977
Mwah.

08:31.978 --> 08:34.712
After last night,
you deserve to relax.

08:34.714 --> 08:35.714
Mm-hmm.

08:35.715 --> 08:38.250
Rest your womb.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.719
What, my womb?

08:40.720 --> 08:42.221
Yeah.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.621
Why did you say that?

08:44.924 --> 08:46.792
I don't know.
I don't know. I'm...

08:46.793 --> 08:48.961
I didn't mean anything.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.763
I'm gonna make the pancakes now.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.568
It's just...
What?

08:56.569 --> 08:58.404
Well, I don't know.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.905
Just say it. What?

08:59.906 --> 09:00.986
Do you want to have a baby?

09:02.375 --> 09:04.376
Heh. No. What?

09:04.377 --> 09:07.513
No. I don't know
why I said, "Womb."

09:07.514 --> 09:09.681
I was...
I was just teasing

09:09.682 --> 09:10.762
about how hard
I fucked you.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.852
Okay?

09:17.123 --> 09:18.123
Okay.

09:31.905 --> 09:32.938
What is it?

09:34.641 --> 09:36.408
I don't know.

09:37.444 --> 09:40.045
Okay. Cool.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.581
Wait. I don't know if I'm
ready to have a baby.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.983
I don't know if I'm
ready to have a baby.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.344
We're gonna have
breakfast together

09:48.321 --> 09:49.721
every day for the rest
of our lives.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.425
I know. I know.
Hmm.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.861
Which means
we got plenty of time

09:55.862 --> 09:58.022
to talk about
your womb and other
married-people things.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.599
Right now,

10:01.835 --> 10:04.736
I think we should just
be on our honeymoon.

10:04.737 --> 10:05.737
Right?

10:05.738 --> 10:07.339
Right.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.373
Okay.

10:09.576 --> 10:10.576
Mm.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.177
Pancakes.
♪ Pancakes ♪

10:17.717 --> 10:19.785
You ready?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.720
This thing's massive.

10:21.721 --> 10:22.855
Where'd it come from?

10:22.856 --> 10:23.889
My dad.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.657
Heh.

10:25.658 --> 10:28.861
I didn't realize he
was that kind of hunter.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.963
Well, what kind
of hunter is that?

10:30.964 --> 10:32.524
The kind that kills
giant fucking bears.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.200
You ever killed anything?

10:36.669 --> 10:39.371
Mm...

10:39.372 --> 10:40.506
rats.

10:40.507 --> 10:43.208
Yeah, murder by trap
doesn't count.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.576
I mean with your bare hands.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.345
Oh, with my bare hands?

10:46.346 --> 10:48.213
Yeah.
Um...

10:48.214 --> 10:49.581
have you?

10:50.783 --> 10:52.417
No. No.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.987
I mean, just fish.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.889
Mm, I guess a few frogs.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.056
What?

10:58.057 --> 10:59.591
Oh, when I was little.

10:59.592 --> 11:02.194
We'd use 'em as bait,
like little, mini baby ones.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.096
Oh, right. Mm-hmm.
The little baby ones.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.797
Yeah, baby ones.
Is that normal?

11:05.798 --> 11:07.966
Oh, they scream
when you cast them.

11:07.967 --> 11:09.368
Oh, my God.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.536
Who are you?

11:10.537 --> 11:11.904
Eee!

11:11.905 --> 11:13.105
Aah!

11:44.337 --> 11:46.071
Come on.

12:02.021 --> 12:03.522
What?

12:03.523 --> 12:06.358
What, should we
grab your water wings,
too, Pauly Poo?

12:06.359 --> 12:07.759
I'm really not embarrassed

12:07.760 --> 12:10.562
by wanting
a little extra security
on the water.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.598
Here.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.674
You tied it,
right?

12:55.675 --> 12:57.376
Tied what?
The anchor.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.077
You tied the rope
before you dropped it?

12:59.078 --> 13:01.013
Didn't you just tell me
to drop it in?

13:02.281 --> 13:04.249
You're good at that.

13:07.820 --> 13:10.622
12 years of Girl Scouts.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.290
Last one
in the water's
a rotten egg.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.259
What are you talking about?

13:14.260 --> 13:15.260
Well, if you're afraid,

13:16.629 --> 13:18.664
you can just stay
in the boat like a baby.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.105
I'm not afraid
of the lake.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.234
Fine.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.336
Hmm.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.804
Take off your shirt.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.872
All right.

13:32.578 --> 13:33.945
No. No, this...

13:33.946 --> 13:35.714
Heh. No.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.315
Why not? Come on.
No.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.851
Ah, I'm sorry.
I seem to remember
someone saying,

13:39.852 --> 13:41.953
"Oh, and it's gonna
be just before summer,

13:41.954 --> 13:44.690
"so we're totally
gonna have the whole lake
to ourselves,

13:44.691 --> 13:46.725
and there'll be
no one around..."

13:46.726 --> 13:48.126
Yeah.
And, uh, oh, shit,

13:48.127 --> 13:50.862
yep. No one around.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.431
Hello!

13:52.432 --> 13:54.433
Yeah, looks like
no one's around.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.902
Yeah, well,
I-I'll take this
under consideration.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.637
Okay?

13:58.638 --> 14:00.005
What?

14:00.006 --> 14:02.074
Oh, it's so cold.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.575
It's freezing.
Freezing?

14:03.576 --> 14:05.177
I thought
something had snapped...

14:05.178 --> 14:07.145
"Oh, my goodness!"

14:07.146 --> 14:08.780
"Oh, my goodness"?

14:09.949 --> 14:12.584
Oh, my God,
did your womb get cold?

14:12.585 --> 14:14.453
Heh. No,

14:14.454 --> 14:17.222
but it did freeze
my big, giant...

14:17.223 --> 14:18.523
balls.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.025
No, Paul.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.326
No.
Oh, no.

14:21.327 --> 14:22.794
No, no, no.
Oh, no.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.129
No, Paul. No, no.
1...

14:24.130 --> 14:26.331
No, no, no!
2...

14:26.332 --> 14:27.332
3!

14:33.606 --> 14:35.207
Mm.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.176
I really
wanted to go
swimming with you.

14:38.177 --> 14:39.977
I really wanted to go
skinny-dipping with you.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.794
I'm hungry.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.428
Oh, weird.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.631
I feel kind of full.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.632
You're a dirty girl.

15:36.335 --> 15:37.769
You are a dirty girl

15:40.306 --> 15:42.440
who deserves...

15:42.441 --> 15:44.976
to be punished.

15:44.977 --> 15:47.813
Paul.
Paul, stop.

15:47.814 --> 15:48.914
Stop.

15:59.892 --> 16:00.892
This it?

16:00.893 --> 16:02.360
Catchy name.

16:02.361 --> 16:05.030
Yeah.
Their specialty is food.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.998
Last one there is a rotten egg.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.870
Fuck.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.312
They even open?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.948
They should be.

16:28.020 --> 16:30.589
We're closed.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.825
W-We're closed!

16:35.561 --> 16:38.096
Yeah, okay, buddy.
We got it.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.531
We're leaving.

16:43.102 --> 16:44.102
Trixie?

16:44.470 --> 16:46.838
Trixie, it's me.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.442
Heh.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.443
It's Will.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.279
Holy...

16:55.481 --> 16:56.748
Will.

16:59.318 --> 17:02.053
My God, I haven't
seen you in forever.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.255
Wow.
Uh, yeah.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.256
Will.

17:04.257 --> 17:07.224
God, you look...

17:08.728 --> 17:10.694
<i>Merci. Merci.</i>

17:10.695 --> 17:12.097
This is my... Paul,

17:14.367 --> 17:16.401
my husband Paul.
Hey.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.442
I've been building up
the maple beans
here for years.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.540
When did you start working here?

17:23.541 --> 17:26.243
Uh, actually,
it's my wife,

17:26.244 --> 17:29.447
uh, Annie's family's place.

17:29.448 --> 17:30.849
Annie's family owns it.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.985
Ah. That's great.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.487
Heh.
Yeah.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.222
Sorry about that before.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.860
Mm.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.762
Everything's broken around here.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.033
Still wearing
this old thing, huh?

17:48.034 --> 17:51.036
Oh, yeah, despite
Annie's best efforts.

17:51.037 --> 17:54.506
She'll have to pry it
off my cold, dead head.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.547
Oh, Will used to be
a great hockey player.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.611
Hey, still am.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.252
That's the one with
the ice skates, right?

18:03.516 --> 18:05.556
Well, uh, let me see
if I can rustle us up
some grub.

18:09.855 --> 18:11.089
Annie.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.224
You should leave.

18:13.225 --> 18:14.225
They're leaving.

18:14.226 --> 18:15.427
You should leave.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.494
They're leaving.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.018
Annie's not feeling so well.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.436
Not quite yourself today,
are you, Annie?

18:26.572 --> 18:28.673
Well, let me
go grab those beans,

18:31.477 --> 18:33.197
maybe some cheese curds
for old time's sake.

18:35.514 --> 18:36.554
Can't believe you're here.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.157
There's that smile.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.418
Your husband is waking up early

19:13.419 --> 19:14.986
to catch his wifey
a delicious dinner.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.123
Hmm.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.125
Really?

19:23.362 --> 19:25.363
You're not even
gonna question that?

19:25.364 --> 19:26.898
No, I... That sounds great.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.301
I was just thinking.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.805
About...

19:35.141 --> 19:36.274
I don't know.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.477
Nothing.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.280
Your ex-lover.

19:42.281 --> 19:43.815
He wa...

19:43.816 --> 19:45.376
He was a summer friend
when I was a kid.

19:47.286 --> 19:48.286
Heh.

19:48.287 --> 19:49.521
Oh, really?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.156
Trixie...

19:51.157 --> 19:52.557
a friend?

19:59.365 --> 20:01.933
That woman was just so...

20:01.934 --> 20:04.702
Wait. Are you calling
his wife, "that woman"?

20:04.703 --> 20:07.205
What? She seemed
completely out of it,

20:07.206 --> 20:08.573
like not normal.

20:08.574 --> 20:10.975
Yeah, probably
because that woman
has had enough

20:10.976 --> 20:14.345
of the "I can
kill a bear with
my bare hands" bullshit.

20:14.346 --> 20:15.814
Well, he's just
a little intense.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.716
Yeah, a little intense,
like a fucking maniac.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.718
Hey, in the five minutes
we were there,

20:20.719 --> 20:22.087
he smashed a lamp...

20:22.088 --> 20:23.955
Yeah, well, he's not
like that. I know him.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.958
And put his wife's arm
in a vise grip.

20:26.959 --> 20:30.462
She obviously
did something awful.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.930
Are you defending him?

20:31.931 --> 20:33.298
Do you miss him?

20:33.299 --> 20:36.167
What, just 'cause
he's a little more
alpha than you?

20:36.168 --> 20:38.236
You love him.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.238
Well, I can't help it.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.399
His tiny, sexy,
13-year-old...

20:54.787 --> 20:55.787
I'm not like him.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.389
You're not like her.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.329
We aren't like them.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.330
I know.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.399
We're the best.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.499
Mm.

21:43.335 --> 21:44.335
Mm.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.137
Get it.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.377
Mm.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.447
Mm.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.986
Mm.

22:09.261 --> 22:12.063
I'm gonna catch you
a giant fish...

22:12.698 --> 22:15.466
with my bare hands.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.100
Shit.

23:21.533 --> 23:23.268
My alarm went off early.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.107
The power
must have gone out.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.913
Bea?

23:39.151 --> 23:42.020
Are you peeing?

23:44.723 --> 23:47.058
Are you ignoring me?

23:51.263 --> 23:53.031
Bea?

23:56.735 --> 23:57.735
This isn't funny.

23:58.504 --> 24:00.104
Come on.

24:13.385 --> 24:14.852
Fine.

24:14.853 --> 24:15.853
Keep hiding.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.656
I'm going back to sleep.

24:54.526 --> 24:56.027
Bea?

25:18.384 --> 25:19.884
Bea?!

25:29.261 --> 25:31.195
Bea?

25:41.740 --> 25:43.574
Bea?!

25:56.789 --> 25:58.389
Please!

26:02.494 --> 26:03.494
This isn't funny!

26:04.596 --> 26:06.431
Come on!

26:23.415 --> 26:25.216
Bea?

26:36.462 --> 26:38.629
Bea!

26:46.672 --> 26:48.372
Bea!

27:07.025 --> 27:08.192
Bea?

27:47.399 --> 27:48.666
You okay?

27:49.668 --> 27:51.235
Yeah.

27:51.236 --> 27:52.970
What happened?

27:53.972 --> 27:56.841
Nothing.
I don't know.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.009
What happened?
Nothing.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.744
I'm okay.

27:59.745 --> 28:02.046
Your skin is... is so cold.
I'm fine. I'm okay.

28:02.047 --> 28:04.515
You... You feel so...
I'm fine.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.350
I'm fine.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.871
Where's your...
Where's your nightgown?

28:09.087 --> 28:10.447
Where's your...
Where's your, uh...

28:12.291 --> 28:13.758
Paul, stop.
Come here.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.159
Um...
Paul, come here.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.761
I couldn't find you.

28:16.762 --> 28:17.795
Come here.
Please come here.

28:17.796 --> 28:18.829
Please come here.
Come here.

28:18.830 --> 28:19.830
Okay.

28:19.831 --> 28:22.400
Honey, look.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.735
I mean,
I'm just cold. Shh.

28:24.736 --> 28:26.270
Okay.

28:26.271 --> 28:27.705
Okay.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.007
You're okay.

28:30.008 --> 28:31.375
We're okay.
I'm so sorry.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.910
Why? No.
I'm so sorry.

28:32.911 --> 28:34.812
I didn't mean
to scare you. I...

28:34.813 --> 28:36.514
I didn't.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.482
Um...

28:38.483 --> 28:41.252
you... you must
have been, uh...

28:41.253 --> 28:43.120
I must be sleepwalking.

28:43.121 --> 28:44.622
Sleepwalking. Okay.

28:44.623 --> 28:45.890
Mm-hmm.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.825
Yeah.

28:47.826 --> 28:50.061
Okay. Um...

28:53.165 --> 28:54.165
It's okay.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.601
I thought...

28:58.003 --> 29:00.204
I thought... I thought
something bad had...

29:11.049 --> 29:13.484
I'm fine.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.191
How's my little zombie face
this morning?

29:57.062 --> 29:59.563
I'm serious.

29:59.564 --> 30:00.598
I'm fine.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.199
Hmm?
Mm.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.634
What you making?

30:04.870 --> 30:05.870
French toast.

30:05.871 --> 30:07.271
Oh, good.

30:07.272 --> 30:10.474
Obviously not as good
as my pancakes,
but good.

30:10.475 --> 30:11.275
Heh.

30:11.276 --> 30:13.844
What's that smell?

30:13.845 --> 30:15.746
Whoa.

30:15.747 --> 30:16.847
These... These
are burning.

30:16.848 --> 30:18.315
What?

30:18.316 --> 30:20.017
This bread isn't battered.

30:20.018 --> 30:22.119
What are you talking about?

30:22.120 --> 30:23.487
You forgot to batter the bread.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.756
No, I didn't. It...
Yes, you did.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.925
That's the whole point
of... of French toast.

30:27.926 --> 30:29.260
You... You batter the bread.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.362
All right, you okay here?

30:32.931 --> 30:35.566
Yeah. No, I'm f...

30:35.567 --> 30:38.102
I'm just feeling a little funny.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.103
That's all.

30:39.104 --> 30:41.005
Funny? Like how?

30:41.006 --> 30:42.506
I don't know.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.608
We should go into town.
No, no, I'm fine.

30:44.609 --> 30:46.777
Gotta be, like, a doctor
or something or...
No, don't be crazy.

30:46.778 --> 30:48.312
We've spent hundreds
of nights together,

30:48.313 --> 30:49.814
and you've never
been a sleepwalker.

30:49.815 --> 30:51.215
I'm just tired.

30:51.216 --> 30:53.884
You've never forgotten
how to make French toast.

30:53.885 --> 30:55.553
I promise.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.555
I promise.

30:57.556 --> 30:58.689
Mm.

31:01.827 --> 31:03.561
Okay.

31:05.497 --> 31:07.264
So...

31:07.265 --> 31:09.667
bit of milk.

31:09.668 --> 31:10.868
That's an egg.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.404
Shut up.

31:13.405 --> 31:14.405
Now for the cinnamon...

31:15.240 --> 31:16.674
Okay, I got it.
I got it.

31:16.675 --> 31:17.675
Okay.
Got it.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.043
Well, I made the coffee.

31:20.946 --> 31:21.979
Oh.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.748
Well, I thought today, maybe,

31:23.749 --> 31:26.584
if you're up for it,
we could go out onto the...

31:26.585 --> 31:27.585
What is it?

31:27.586 --> 31:28.986
What is it?

32:02.988 --> 32:04.121
What are you doing?

32:04.122 --> 32:06.423
Look at this fatty one.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.396
Oh. Oh.

32:12.397 --> 32:15.399
This big, fatty one
is gonna be our dinner.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.335
Why aren't you laughing?

32:19.805 --> 32:21.405
I don't know.

32:23.408 --> 32:24.408
You want to go back?

32:26.545 --> 32:27.578
No. No.

32:36.521 --> 32:39.089
Thought you would
find that funny,

32:39.090 --> 32:40.357
as a frog killer.

32:41.359 --> 32:43.494
Hey.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.863
Froggy Krueger.

32:45.864 --> 32:47.731
Yo.

32:58.910 --> 33:00.744
Let's go swimming.

33:00.745 --> 33:02.413
Heh.

33:02.414 --> 33:03.414
That's funny.

33:03.415 --> 33:04.515
You're funny.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.717
Last one in's a rotten egg!

33:29.107 --> 33:30.107
How's it going?

33:31.476 --> 33:33.010
How's it going with you?

33:35.747 --> 33:37.948
Did you rinse off all
the creepy-crawlies?

33:45.790 --> 33:48.225
Why'd you do that?

33:48.226 --> 33:50.227
You knew the water was cold.

33:50.228 --> 33:52.563
I don't know.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.664
I thought it'd be funny.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.686
I'm sorry.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.855
What's going on with you?

34:17.856 --> 34:19.456
I'm tired.

34:19.456 --> 34:21.926
The drive, the wedding,

34:21.927 --> 34:25.262
stress of everything
is catching up to me.

34:25.263 --> 34:27.063
The wedding?

34:27.065 --> 34:29.466
Oh, I... No,
I was just saying...

34:29.467 --> 34:31.467
You wanted to get married.

34:31.469 --> 34:34.170
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.672
That's all I want.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.741
I just want to make you happy.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.275
You do.

34:39.277 --> 34:40.978
I promise.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.498
Paul.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.403
Paul.

35:06.404 --> 35:07.771
Paul.
What's this?

35:07.772 --> 35:09.907
What?
What are these?

35:09.908 --> 35:11.408
What is this?

35:11.409 --> 35:12.509
Bea.

35:12.510 --> 35:13.944
Jesus.
They're mosquito bites.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.413
I know what a fucking
mosquito bite looks like.

35:16.414 --> 35:17.494
W-Way to get me
in the mood.

35:18.483 --> 35:19.883
Okay.

35:20.986 --> 35:21.986
Okay, I just...

35:26.524 --> 35:29.560
Do you think something
maybe bit you

35:29.561 --> 35:30.928
when you were sleepwalking?

35:30.929 --> 35:33.330
Yeah. Yeah, no,
I think you're right.

35:33.331 --> 35:34.598
I think something bit me.

35:34.599 --> 35:37.368
You do?
Yes, mosquitoes.

35:37.369 --> 35:38.435
Don't get upset.
I'm worried.

35:38.436 --> 35:39.670
I'm tired, okay?

35:39.671 --> 35:41.872
I think I'm just
gonna go take a sleep.

35:41.873 --> 35:42.740
What?

35:42.741 --> 35:44.908
I'm just gonna go take a nap.

37:59.177 --> 38:00.310
Bea.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.986
I think... Oh, I...

38:10.688 --> 38:11.728
I kind of have a headache.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.925
Oh, I feel like we should...

38:17.128 --> 38:18.928
I feel like
we should get
a good night's sleep.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.132
I'm just not really in the mood.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.303
Oh, I don't know.
I took some Advil,

38:28.740 --> 38:29.940
but this hea...

38:29.941 --> 38:31.208
I don't know.

38:32.944 --> 38:35.179
I don't know.
I took some Tylenol,

38:35.180 --> 38:36.460
but this headache won't go away.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.216
I can't help it.

38:40.618 --> 38:43.020
My tummy hurts.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.337
My stomach just feels icky.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.195
Icky.

38:51.763 --> 38:54.364
Icky.

39:05.043 --> 39:07.277
Hey there.

39:07.278 --> 39:08.278
Hey.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.055
Trade you.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.294
Two of a kind.

40:30.295 --> 40:31.929
Some people
might call it a pair.

40:39.737 --> 40:41.772
Hmm. Small straight.

40:41.773 --> 40:42.973
I'll take that as my Chance.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.343
You're my chance.

40:53.251 --> 40:54.251
I want to kiss you.

40:54.986 --> 40:57.220
I want to kiss you.

41:25.350 --> 41:26.590
You're gonna kill me.

41:28.052 --> 41:29.453
Mm.

41:30.455 --> 41:32.489
What? What is it?

41:32.490 --> 41:35.492
Oh, I kind of have a headache.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.094
Oh, I took some Tylenol,

41:37.095 --> 41:39.296
but this headache won't go away.

41:47.271 --> 41:49.072
Are you mad?

41:49.073 --> 41:50.107
No.

41:53.711 --> 41:55.312
No.

42:00.752 --> 42:02.319
Are you trying
to not have sex with me?

42:05.490 --> 42:06.723
What?

42:06.724 --> 42:10.060
Are you avoiding
sleeping with me?

42:10.061 --> 42:11.395
You're acting crazy.

42:11.396 --> 42:12.462
I'm your husband.

42:13.464 --> 42:14.898
And I'm your wife.

42:14.899 --> 42:16.466
We talk to each other.

42:16.467 --> 42:17.467
I know that.

42:17.468 --> 42:18.735
You can tell me if...

42:18.736 --> 42:19.736
My head hurts.

42:20.438 --> 42:22.873
Did something happen
in the woods?

42:24.976 --> 42:26.543
I was sleepwalking.

42:28.713 --> 42:29.713
You feel distant.

42:31.215 --> 42:32.616
Y-You feel
different.

42:34.986 --> 42:36.586
You feel distracted.

42:54.338 --> 42:55.472
Bea.

42:55.473 --> 42:57.074
Bea.

42:57.075 --> 42:59.076
I want to make you happy.

43:04.515 --> 43:06.383
Put on your nightgown.

43:06.384 --> 43:07.664
What? What are
you talking about?

43:09.053 --> 43:10.333
Your special
honeymoon nightgown.

43:13.624 --> 43:14.858
Why?

43:14.859 --> 43:16.827
I want to see it on you.

43:16.828 --> 43:18.361
Come on. Put it on.

43:18.362 --> 43:19.362
No.

43:19.363 --> 43:20.363
Why not?

43:20.364 --> 43:22.966
Are you really
doing this right now?

43:25.236 --> 43:26.303
It looks sexy.

43:27.772 --> 43:29.773
No, I can't.

43:29.774 --> 43:31.041
Why not?

43:31.042 --> 43:32.442
I put it away.

43:32.443 --> 43:35.812
It's put away
with my dirty laundry.

43:35.813 --> 43:38.014
It's in the box,
the clothes bo...

43:38.015 --> 43:39.983
the suitcase.
It's in the suitcase.

43:39.984 --> 43:42.519
It's in the suitcase
with my dirty laundry.

43:45.590 --> 43:48.558
What, do you really
want me to go get it?

43:53.297 --> 43:54.698
No.

45:15.213 --> 45:16.213
Where'd you go?

45:17.281 --> 45:20.116
I was getting a drink.

45:31.762 --> 45:33.029
Are you staying there?

45:33.030 --> 45:34.364
Where's your glass?

48:27.138 --> 48:28.772
What are you doing?

48:28.773 --> 48:29.773
Went outside.

48:30.975 --> 48:32.108
You can't do that.

48:32.109 --> 48:33.309
We're in the middle of nowhere.

48:33.310 --> 48:34.244
You don't know what's out there.

48:34.245 --> 48:35.311
Someone was out there.

48:35.312 --> 48:37.747
What are you talking about?

48:37.748 --> 48:41.384
Looking in our windows,
playing some
little game,

48:41.385 --> 48:42.952
shining some
high-beam flashlight

48:42.953 --> 48:44.120
in your face while you sleep.

48:44.121 --> 48:46.656
No.
Yes.

48:46.657 --> 48:48.158
Yes.

48:48.159 --> 48:50.693
I took a walk
in the woods earlier.

48:50.694 --> 48:53.430
What does that have
to do with anything?

48:53.431 --> 48:55.265
Where you were sleepwalking.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.400
Why would you go ba...

48:57.401 --> 48:58.401
Why are you lying to me?

49:01.372 --> 49:03.773
I was sleepwalking.

49:05.376 --> 49:06.976
I'm confused.

49:06.977 --> 49:09.345
I found footprints.

49:09.346 --> 49:11.147
It was muddy.

49:11.148 --> 49:12.348
They weren't ours.

49:12.349 --> 49:14.284
I know someone was
in the woods with you,

49:14.285 --> 49:17.220
and I know someone
was just outside,
looking in our windows.

49:17.221 --> 49:18.221
No.

49:18.422 --> 49:20.924
This is me standing here.

49:23.961 --> 49:24.961
Okay? It's me.

49:26.664 --> 49:27.831
I love you.

49:29.567 --> 49:31.234
I love you so much,

49:33.504 --> 49:34.824
but I... I need you
to talk to me.

49:36.440 --> 49:37.874
Did you meet him?

49:39.743 --> 49:42.545
What?

49:43.981 --> 49:45.582
Who?

49:45.583 --> 49:46.883
Will.

49:48.085 --> 49:49.452
What?

49:49.453 --> 49:51.020
I just want to know
what happened.

49:51.021 --> 49:52.388
I just want you to tell me...

49:52.389 --> 49:54.157
What do you want me to tell you?

49:54.158 --> 49:55.992
I get it.
Maybe he wanted to meet,

49:55.993 --> 49:59.062
and y-you just thought,
you know, like... like,
you were kids again.

50:00.264 --> 50:02.232
Please, I know
it's not your fault.

50:02.233 --> 50:03.867
I saw him yelling at his wife.

50:03.868 --> 50:05.835
I saw the way he looked at you.

50:05.836 --> 50:07.437
You don't know what
you're talking about.

50:07.438 --> 50:08.872
Did he do something to you?

50:08.873 --> 50:09.672
Stop it.

50:09.673 --> 50:10.907
Did he hurt you?
Stop it.

50:10.908 --> 50:11.908
I'm worried.

50:11.909 --> 50:12.909
You're acting crazy.

50:12.910 --> 50:14.110
Why are you doing this?

50:14.111 --> 50:15.245
Because I want to protect you.

50:15.246 --> 50:16.246
It wasn't Will!

50:16.247 --> 50:17.547
Okay?! You have to stop!

50:17.548 --> 50:19.282
He was looking in our windows!

50:19.283 --> 50:21.417
You probably saw a boat
or the moon.

50:21.418 --> 50:23.653
It wasn't the fucking moon!

50:27.958 --> 50:29.993
You have to stop.

50:34.064 --> 50:37.133
You're ruining this.

50:37.134 --> 50:40.069
You're ruining
our time together.

52:22.706 --> 52:24.741
Morning.

52:24.742 --> 52:25.908
Morning.

52:25.909 --> 52:27.977
What are you doing?

52:30.047 --> 52:32.482
What is this?

52:33.717 --> 52:35.785
Nothing.

52:41.225 --> 52:42.265
Doesn't look like nothing.

52:46.630 --> 52:49.365
What are you doing?

52:50.801 --> 52:53.002
Nothing.

52:53.003 --> 52:54.003
You want some help?

52:56.006 --> 52:58.641
No, I got it.

53:25.302 --> 53:26.302
Why do you do that?

53:27.271 --> 53:29.005
I don't know.

53:30.674 --> 53:33.042
They're just ants.

53:33.577 --> 53:36.479
How are the bug bites?

53:38.015 --> 53:40.049
Fine.

53:40.050 --> 53:41.150
Better.

53:41.151 --> 53:42.151
They don't look better.

53:43.454 --> 53:45.088
They look worse.

53:45.089 --> 53:47.123
Not really like bug bites
at all, in fact.

53:50.127 --> 53:51.394
I was just trying to be nice.

54:46.383 --> 54:48.785
Hi.

54:48.786 --> 54:50.887
Hi.

55:14.912 --> 55:18.648
They can live for up
to five minutes underwater.

55:41.505 --> 55:43.940
I want to leave.

55:43.941 --> 55:45.074
What are you talking about?

55:45.976 --> 55:48.477
I want us to leave,

55:50.814 --> 55:52.774
for us to get out of here
and go back to the city.

55:53.884 --> 55:54.884
We're on our honeymoon.

55:56.053 --> 55:59.088
Why would you say that?
Why would you say that?

55:59.089 --> 56:00.556
Nothing's feeling right
out here.

56:00.557 --> 56:02.658
Everything feels different.

56:09.433 --> 56:10.967
I don't want to fight.

56:10.968 --> 56:13.202
I don't want to fight
with you. I just...

56:13.203 --> 56:16.439
Last night was horrible.
Today was horrible.

56:16.440 --> 56:19.609
I don't want to sleep
without you ever again.

56:19.610 --> 56:21.344
I don't want to either.

56:25.215 --> 56:27.350
I need you.

56:27.351 --> 56:29.685
I miss you.

56:29.686 --> 56:31.120
Miss you.

56:46.770 --> 56:48.604
Paul.

56:54.077 --> 56:55.378
I'm fine.

57:01.051 --> 57:04.253
This is a lot of blood.
This isn't normal.

57:04.254 --> 57:05.421
We need a doctor.

57:05.422 --> 57:07.857
I'm not going
to the doctor
for my period.

57:07.858 --> 57:09.592
That's not what this is.

57:09.593 --> 57:11.694
It's not?
No.

57:11.695 --> 57:14.830
I sat there while you
marked the calendar

57:14.831 --> 57:16.332
and counted the days

57:16.333 --> 57:19.535
so we didn't have
to deal with it now.

57:19.536 --> 57:21.437
Enough of this.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.639
O-Of what? Of me?

57:23.640 --> 57:25.641
Y-You've got bruises
on your thighs.

57:25.642 --> 57:27.122
You're bleeding.
Why are you bleeding?

57:28.478 --> 57:30.546
We're not staying here.

57:31.848 --> 57:33.582
Paul, please calm down,
okay?

57:33.583 --> 57:34.784
Pack... Pack your bags.

57:34.785 --> 57:37.119
When I come back,
we're leaving, okay?

57:37.120 --> 57:38.654
We're gonna get you help.

57:38.655 --> 57:40.156
Where are you going?

57:40.157 --> 57:42.491
I can't help you
if I don't know
what happened.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.661
Okay?

57:47.097 --> 57:49.265
If you won't tell me,

57:49.266 --> 57:51.033
I'll ask him.

57:51.034 --> 57:52.268
Paul.

57:52.269 --> 57:54.003
Paul!

57:54.004 --> 57:55.004
Paul!

58:08.452 --> 58:10.412
Excuse me. Hi.
I was... I was here
the other night.

58:12.556 --> 58:13.789
My wife knows your husband.

58:13.790 --> 58:15.491
I-I'm sorry.

58:15.492 --> 58:16.892
Are you okay?

58:16.893 --> 58:18.361
Let me help you.

58:18.362 --> 58:19.996
My name is Annie.

58:21.365 --> 58:22.365
Right. I-I'm Paul.

58:23.867 --> 58:24.900
My husband is Will.

58:26.770 --> 58:27.770
Yeah. I-Is he around?

58:27.771 --> 58:28.771
Can you get him for me?

58:29.973 --> 58:31.707
Will's not here.

58:33.276 --> 58:35.511
Where is he?

58:36.847 --> 58:37.847
He's hiding.

58:45.856 --> 58:47.376
What happened...
happened to your legs?

58:48.825 --> 58:50.385
How did you
get those marks
on your legs?

58:52.529 --> 58:54.096
Did he do this to you?

58:54.097 --> 58:55.931
You should stay away from us.

58:55.932 --> 58:57.733
I can help you.

58:57.734 --> 58:59.068
We're not safe.

58:59.069 --> 59:03.105
We will hurt you.

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:06.202
Hello.

Mm.

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:37.980

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.338
You are my husband.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.440
What's my name?

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:06.842
Go on.
You just said it.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.181
My husband is Paul.

01:04:15.719 --> 01:04:16.785

My favorite color is blue.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.474
I'm allergic
to hazelnuts.
"Hazelnuts.

01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:39.775
"I don't like..."
I don't like...

01:04:39.776 --> 01:04:41.610
"the taste of ketchup."
the taste of ketchup.

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:43.746
Why are you writing
these things?

01:04:43.747 --> 01:04:45.147
These aren't things
you memorize.

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.818
This is you.

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:51.620
This is Bea.

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:53.155
Why are you writing
these things?

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:57.593
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.396
Talked to Will's wife.

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:04.400
What?
It's the same thing as this,

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:05.961
the same thing as this,
page after page.

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:09.605
"My name is Annie.

01:05:09.606 --> 01:05:12.441
My husband is Will.
This is my home."

01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:14.710
Why are you writing
these things?

01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:16.145
Please. Please.

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:18.580
Why are you doing the same thing

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.582
as a woman you barely know?

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.317
Please. Please, stop.
Why do you have...

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:24.086
Why do you have
the same marks...

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:25.487
Stop. Stop.
On your legs?

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:26.955
Stop it.
I just... Stop it.

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:29.076
Why are you both waking up
in the middle of the night?

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:31.226
Who's out there?

01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:35.230
Who is shining the light?

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.431
Why did you
go back there? Why?

01:05:38.902 --> 01:05:40.002
It wasn't Will.

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:41.203
There was blood on Will's hat.

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.439
There was blood on Will's hat.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.278
Yeah.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:50.946
What happened to him?

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:52.147
What did she do to him?

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:53.949
Stop it.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.751
What are you gonna do to me?

01:05:55.752 --> 01:05:56.819
I want to protect you.

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:11.500
Where are the car keys?

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:14.970
Where...

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:18.974
Where did you put the key?

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:35.290
Where are the keys?!

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:38.327
Open up.

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:42.464
Open up.

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:49.404
Open up, Bea!

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.351
Bea.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.053
Go back to the bedroom.
Bea, honeybee.

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:07.356
You have to to back
to the bedroom.
What are you doing?

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:08.657
Go back to the bedroom.
You're bleeding.

01:07:08.658 --> 01:07:10.325
Listen to me.
What are you doing?

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:12.327
Listen. Please don't
do this to me now.
You're bleeding.

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:13.562
Go back to the bedroom!

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:15.163
Why are you yelling?!
Okay. Okay.

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:16.632
We'll go back together.

01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:18.267
What are you talking about?
We'll go back together.

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:19.535
Stop it! Stop it!
Go back to the bedroom.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:20.903
Stop saying that!

01:07:20.904 --> 01:07:22.871
Tell me what's going on!
I don't want to.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.173
I don't want to.
Tell me what's going on!

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:26.642
Talk to me!

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:27.676
Stop!

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:28.477
Bea!

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:29.611
Please come here.

01:07:29.612 --> 01:07:31.313
Get up!
Please come here.

01:07:31.314 --> 01:07:32.814
Tell me what's going on!

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:36.051
Tell me what's going on.

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:37.819
Tell me what's going on.

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:41.790
Tell me what's going on.

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:42.624
Why are you...

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:44.560
Why are you hurting yourself?

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:45.594
You're scaring me.

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:48.931
I love you.

01:07:50.033 --> 01:07:51.066
I love you,
honeybee.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:54.536
I love you,
honeybee.

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:58.106
I love you,
honeybee.

01:07:58.107 --> 01:07:59.207
What do you say?

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.842
Answer me.

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:03.512
I say that, and then
what do you say?

01:08:03.513 --> 01:08:05.981
We don't remember.

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:07.115
We don't remember.

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:08.450
Why are you saying that?

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:09.952
We don't remember what to say.

01:08:09.953 --> 01:08:12.354
Why are you saying that?
What are you
talking about?

01:08:12.355 --> 01:08:13.455
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:14.456
What are you talking about?

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:15.991
I'm sorry.

01:08:15.992 --> 01:08:18.859
No! No!
Oh, fuck.

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:20.295
No. Paul!

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:21.897
Paul, no!

01:08:21.898 --> 01:08:23.698
Oh, Paul!

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.300
What are you doing?
What are you...

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:26.468
Stop.
Talk to me!

01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:27.636
Stop it!
Talk to me!

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:28.636
Stop it!

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.607
Don't...
What are you...

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:35.277
Bea!

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.779
No! No.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:42.283
No!
Untie me!

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:43.852
What are you doing?

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:44.886
Let me go!

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:47.889
Stop it.

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:51.093
Stop. What are you doing?

01:08:51.094 --> 01:08:52.493
Hold... Stop it!
Stop it!

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:54.062
Stop it.
Paul!

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:01.870
Paul! Stop!

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:09.978
Oh, God.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:22.124
I don't know...

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:23.524
I don't know
what's happening
to you.

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:28.063
I just want things to be normal.

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:33.035
I just want us to be us.

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:40.575
I just want us to be us.

01:09:57.827 --> 01:10:00.696
Why... Why aren't
you crying?

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.500
My wife cries.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.060
Then if I cry,
will you let me go?

01:10:13.176 --> 01:10:15.477
My wife doesn't act like this.

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:20.315
She tells me everything.

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:25.253
She tells me the truth.

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:38.533
Where is my wife?

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.410
I need her.

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:51.613
It's me.

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:54.349
I need her back.

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:01.123
Wait.

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:14.770
I am your wife.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:17.272
How do I know that?

01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:25.781
How do you not know that?

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.282
Where did we go
on our first date?

01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:43.965
I can't.

01:11:45.368 --> 01:11:46.501
Please.

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:47.769
I... I don't...

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.404
Why not?
Why can't you
remember this?

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:50.939
I don't know.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.108
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:55.944
We ate it, we... we had it
at the wedding.

01:11:55.945 --> 01:11:57.345
We ate it, we had it
at the wedding.

01:12:00.116 --> 01:12:01.683
Four days ago.

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:04.586
I'm sorry.

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:05.587
I don't know.

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:08.456
How did I ask you to marry me?

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:16.331
Where did I propose?

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.099
Huh?

01:12:22.538 --> 01:12:25.106
Where did I propose?

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:31.813
Camping.

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:32.981
Tell me.

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:35.951
We went camping.

01:12:37.153 --> 01:12:39.287
We made s'mores.

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:44.826
Oh, and there were
so many stars.

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:46.862
We snuggled into our tent,

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:49.130
and you said to me...
you said,

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:52.367
"You make me the happiest.
Will you marry me?"

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:55.770
That's right, right?

01:12:58.341 --> 01:12:59.741
Am I right?

01:13:01.277 --> 01:13:03.778
But I... I remember.

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:05.780
It was so quiet and cold,

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:07.883
and there were so many stars.

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:08.884
No.

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:09.918
No.
That's what happened.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.255
No.

01:13:13.256 --> 01:13:16.091
You were sick.

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:17.359
No.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.627
We were on our bed.

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:19.895
I remember a tent.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:21.763
I made a tent on our bed.

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:22.924
No, I... I remember
the stars.

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.834
What happened to Bea?

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:31.172
No, Paul, I knew...
I know it was on our bed.

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:32.240
Where is she?

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.576
Okay, Paul, please,
I knew that's how...

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:36.745
Where is Bea?
It's me.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:37.846
Where is my wife?

01:13:37.847 --> 01:13:39.514
Stop saying that.

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:41.016
Stop saying that.

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:42.317
What has happened?

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:46.521
You look like her,
but you're not her.

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:48.490
Please. I just forgot.

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:56.264
You have her toes.

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:58.333
You have her toes.

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:11.479
You have her knees.

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:19.754
You have her thighs.

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:22.457
It's me.

01:14:26.362 --> 01:14:28.196
You smell the same.

01:14:36.505 --> 01:14:38.873
You taste the same.

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:47.148
But you're different.
You're different.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.484
No.

01:14:54.924 --> 01:14:55.924
How does this feel?

01:14:57.259 --> 01:14:59.027
What does this feel like to you?

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:03.898
It's me.

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.267
Please.

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:24.119
Please, help me.

01:15:25.388 --> 01:15:27.322
Help me.

01:15:28.324 --> 01:15:29.657
Take it out, please.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.360
Take it out.

01:15:52.782 --> 01:15:53.782
Don't stop. Don't stop.

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:57.819
Don't stop.

01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:14.669
Paul, please.

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:16.871
Please.

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:27.782
What is this?

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:31.086
Eh, what is this?

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:33.888
I couldn't tell you.

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:35.924
I couldn't.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.826
What is this?
I'm sorry.

01:16:37.827 --> 01:16:38.827
Oh, fuck.

01:16:38.828 --> 01:16:39.894
Paul.
Oh, fuck.

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:41.696
That's it.
Paul.

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:43.531
This is...
Paul!

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.469
What is...

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:56.611
Something bad happened to me.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.555
Something bad
happened to me
in the woods.

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:10.925
There was a light.

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:14.996
I couldn't see, but...

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:19.100
I could only see their dark,

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:22.930
the outlines of their bodies,

01:17:25.608 --> 01:17:26.608
their dark bodies.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.911
They went inside me.

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:38.052
And then they left, but...

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:39.173
I couldn't see them anymore,

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:41.956
but I could still feel them...

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:44.592
inside.

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.864
I, uh...

01:17:49.865 --> 01:17:52.400
I can still feel them inside.

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:55.737
They're with me,

01:17:57.606 --> 01:18:00.141
and I know what they know,

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:03.044
and I know what they want,

01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:04.779
and I know what I'm
supposed to do.

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:08.416
I don't understand
what you mean.

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:11.953
I... I wanted to tell you.

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:14.222
I wanted, but...

01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:15.223
I'm not allowed.

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.126
I knew it was happening,

01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:21.663
and there was
nothing I could do,

01:18:21.664 --> 01:18:23.198
but I just wanted time.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.519
I just wanted
these last few days.

01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:28.903
What are you saying?

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:30.024
I just wanted our honeymoon.

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:33.441
My body is here,
but I'm leaving.

01:18:36.779 --> 01:18:39.214
They're taking everything.

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:40.335
They're...
they're taking me.

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.117
Bea. They're taking Bea.

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:48.990
No, they're not.

01:18:48.991 --> 01:18:51.025
We need to get help.

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:52.026
No. No.
We need to leave.

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:53.461
Where did you put the keys?

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.463
No. No, you can't leave.
Where are the keys?

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:57.131
Where are the keys?
You don't understand.

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:58.399
Where are the keys?
Okay, you don't understand.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.168
Where are the keys?
You can't leave.

01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:02.270
Where did you put the keys?
Paul, you can't leave.

01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:03.805
Where did you put the keys?
You can't leave.

01:19:03.806 --> 01:19:05.640
You are sick. We need to leave.
We can't leave.

01:19:05.641 --> 01:19:06.608
We need to go.
No. No.

01:19:06.609 --> 01:19:08.977
No, no, no, no.
No, I remember now.

01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:10.378
I remember.
I couldn't before,

01:19:10.379 --> 01:19:13.348
but now I remember.
We went for Indian food.

01:19:13.349 --> 01:19:15.683
That was our first date.
We're okay.

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:16.884
We're okay.
Stop.

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:18.286
We're not, okay?

01:19:18.287 --> 01:19:20.521
No.
This is not okay.

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:22.156
No. Look, we can...

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:24.892
We can watch.
We can watch on the video.

01:19:24.893 --> 01:19:26.094
We can watch it on the video.

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:27.328
We have to fix this.

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:29.631
We can watch it on the video.

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:30.498
We can watch it.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:32.033
I just want to make things okay.

01:19:32.034 --> 01:19:33.534
No, you can't.
Why not?

01:19:33.535 --> 01:19:35.737
It'll be all right.
And please just
stay with me.

01:19:35.738 --> 01:19:37.171
Just stay with me.
What? No.

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:39.540
I just want
to be with you.
I want to be with you.

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.209
We can't stay here
with you like this.

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.210
No. No.
I'm leaving.

01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:43.578
I'm getting help.

01:19:43.579 --> 01:19:45.780
You can't.
You can't.
No, you can't.

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:46.781
No, we know.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.116
You know what we told you.

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:51.085
We don't need you.

01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:55.556
You don't have any more time.

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:01.296
They're gonna get rid of you.

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:08.369
They're...

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:09.704
No, I have to hide you.

01:20:11.707 --> 01:20:13.508
I have to hide you.

01:20:13.509 --> 01:20:15.143
I have to hide you
where we won't find you.

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:16.544
We have to go.

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:18.025
I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen.

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:23.151
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:07.962
What are we doing?

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:11.165
What are we doing out here?

01:21:12.768 --> 01:21:15.436
I'm saving you.

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:16.771
No, I don't need...

01:21:16.772 --> 01:21:17.672
Mm-hmm.

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:20.541
We need to go back
to the cottage.

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.343
Mm-mm.

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:23.911
What are we doing?

01:21:23.912 --> 01:21:25.346
We need to...

01:21:31.854 --> 01:21:33.521
We need to...

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:35.089
Untie me.

01:21:36.925 --> 01:21:37.992
Untie me!

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:41.195
I'm gonna hide you

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:42.196
under the water.

01:21:42.965 --> 01:21:45.099
They can't reach you there.

01:21:46.602 --> 01:21:48.302
They won't find you.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.406
No, no, no, no.

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:52.507
Yes.
No, you can't.

01:21:52.508 --> 01:21:55.009
No, I can't hide in the water.

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:56.244
I can't breathe under the water.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:57.245
No, you don't understand.

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:58.880
You're confused.

01:21:58.881 --> 01:22:00.214
No. No, no, no, no.

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:01.549
No, you have to.
You're confused.

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:03.251
I can't... I can't hide
in the water.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:04.519
No, I have to hide you.
Stop it.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.220
This isn't hiding!
Shh!

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:07.455
You have to hide.
This isn't hiding!

01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:08.456
This isn't hiding!

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:09.657
Stop it!
Have to!

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:11.626
No, Bea! Stop it!

01:22:11.627 --> 01:22:12.627
Stop it! No!

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:43.991
For our first date,
Bea chose an Indian restaurant,

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:45.993
you know, one of
those little places
on Sixth Street

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:49.497
with the colored lights
and the fiber-optic lamps.

01:22:49.498 --> 01:22:52.667
Yum, except that
halfway through the meal,

01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:54.735
I start feeling
my stomach gurgle

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:57.705
in a horrible
food-poisoning-type way,

01:22:57.706 --> 01:23:00.975
and I didn't even
have time to lie to her.

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:03.496
I spend 20 minutes
in the dirty restaurant
toilet and the rest...

01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:07.849
of the night
on Bea's bathroom floor,

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:10.518
because I couldn't make it
to the subway,

01:23:10.519 --> 01:23:12.086
let alone Brooklyn.

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:16.324
So this is our,
"Fuck you, Indian food."

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:18.159
You tried to keep us apart,

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.160
but fuck you.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:22.830
We win.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.200
So we didn't get
a regular wedding cake.

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:29.003
We decided on something
that was special
for us instead.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:30.972
Mm-hmm, special

01:23:30.973 --> 01:23:31.973
and cheap.

01:23:31.974 --> 01:23:33.541
What?

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:37.445
No, I think some people
are annoyed by no cake.

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:43.284
Who cares?

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:45.186
It's our wedding,

01:23:57.966 --> 01:24:00.334
I love you,
honeybee.

01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:20.021
Before, I was alone,

01:24:20.022 --> 01:24:21.856
but now I'm not.
