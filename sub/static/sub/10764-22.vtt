00:01.734 --> 00:03.566
Here are my car keys.

00:03.870 --> 00:06.600
Ashley has a birthday party
to go to on Saturday afternoon.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.506
And Carlton may use the car
to go to glee club practice.

00:09.576 --> 00:10.907
And Master William?

00:10.977 --> 00:14.378
He's not allowed to use the car again
until August of 1992.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.007
Very well, madam.

00:17.083 --> 00:18.675
Everybody, I'm going.

00:18.752 --> 00:22.188
Excuse me, Mother,
but I am very, very offended.

00:22.956 --> 00:26.050
What is it this time, Hilary?
I've started recycling.

00:27.794 --> 00:31.093
That's not it. Instead of making
Geoffrey work on the weekend...

00:31.164 --> 00:33.564
you should leave the running
of this household to me.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.362
I am 21 years old.

00:39.272 --> 00:42.469
I'm sorry, baby. I didn't think
you'd want to run the household.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.169
I've got to learn sometime.

00:44.244 --> 00:48.203
After all, in a couple of years, I'm going
to have my own family and my own butler.

00:48.281 --> 00:50.249
I hope it's no one I know.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.444
- Ready to go, sweetheart?
- All set.

00:54.521 --> 00:57.319
If you had to pick a weekend to go away,
you picked a good one.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.257
I'll be at the office working
most of the time anyway.

01:00.326 --> 01:03.489
If you have a lot of work to do,
why don't you just do it here?

01:11.604 --> 01:12.730
That's why.

01:14.307 --> 01:16.867
How y'all doing?
I just got my hair cut. Kind of fly, huh?

01:16.943 --> 01:19.434
I don't understand why
you get your hair cut like that.

01:19.512 --> 01:22.003
All the brothers in Philly
play their hair like this...

01:22.082 --> 01:23.913
hair on top, none on the sides.

01:23.983 --> 01:26.952
But, I guess y'all got kind of
a reverse thing going on here.

01:31.324 --> 01:34.157
- Will, I'm leaving.
- You're leaving?

01:34.227 --> 01:37.390
Finally. I always thought
you could do better. Good luck.

01:37.630 --> 01:40.531
Will, I'm going to Berkeley
to give my lecture.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.592
- You are? When you coming back?
- Tomorrow night. While I'm gone...

01:43.670 --> 01:46.537
I want you to do everything
your Uncle Philip says.

01:51.177 --> 01:53.702
Aunt Viv, wait. Don't leave me here.

01:53.780 --> 01:57.580
Don't leave me here with him!
He's going to eat me. Don't leave me here.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.182
Michelle, we're in luck.

03:10.256 --> 03:13.316
My mom's away for the weekend,
our butler's off duty...

03:13.459 --> 03:16.223
and my dad will be leaving
for the office at any minute.

03:16.296 --> 03:19.527
And I just took a multivitamin.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.063
I really like this room, Carlton.

03:25.171 --> 03:27.196
You'll like it more in a minute.

03:45.091 --> 03:47.184
Michelle, I just wanted to say...

03:48.628 --> 03:52.155
I think you're the most talented member
on the swimnastics team.

03:52.966 --> 03:56.060
I can hold my breath
for long periods of time.

03:57.270 --> 04:00.262
Good. We're going under.

04:01.608 --> 04:04.099
Hello. Rice Krispie Treats?

04:06.279 --> 04:07.576
What are you doing?

04:07.647 --> 04:11.048
Mom left me in charge, so I have to be
responsible for all the children.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.051
We were in the middle of something.

04:13.119 --> 04:15.485
Come on, kids, let's have a little talk.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.416
Carlton, Michelle.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.989
I can remember what
it was like to be your age.

04:23.062 --> 04:26.031
Your bodies are going
through a lot of changes now...

04:26.432 --> 04:28.593
and you're probably having
a lot of feelings...

04:28.668 --> 04:30.363
that you've never had before.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.234
But even though there's a lot
of pressure from your peers...

04:33.306 --> 04:36.639
remember, you don't have to pet
to be popular.

04:37.844 --> 04:39.709
Let's go to the mall.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.711
And who exactly
is going to be at this mall?

04:45.785 --> 04:49.186
Hold on, Uncle Phil, I promise
I'll take good care of the car.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.880
Give me that.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.983
I'll trade you for the car keys.

04:56.062 --> 04:59.793
Will, I have a lot of work to do,
so I'm gonna make this short and sweet.

04:59.866 --> 05:03.131
I don't want you taking our car downtown
to some pool hall.

05:03.269 --> 05:05.999
You can't do this to me! Aunt Viv!

05:06.172 --> 05:07.935
She's gone.

05:09.676 --> 05:13.442
That's right, Will.
No one can hear you scream.

05:15.415 --> 05:19.351
Come on. Just 'cause you don't like
pool halls doesn't mean I shouldn't go.

05:19.419 --> 05:21.853
You're just trying to make sure
I don't have any fun.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.412
Your only source of pleasure
is making me unhappy.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.459
That's not true. I have my wine collection.

05:35.268 --> 05:38.237
Hold up. You wasn't listening.

05:38.438 --> 05:42.374
Your uncle ain't say you couldn't go
to the pool hall.

05:42.442 --> 05:45.377
He said he ain't want you
to go to the pool hall.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.844
It's a difference.

05:49.482 --> 05:52.576
What are you, ignorant?
Pick up the damn keys.

06:04.330 --> 06:07.561
And next time you come in here,
I'm going to use this.

06:13.506 --> 06:14.837
And stay out!

06:17.877 --> 06:20.812
- I had your back.
- So what do you want?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.674
- To be your friend.
- Dream on.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.377
Then I'll take a table.

06:25.785 --> 06:28.515
You're in luck.
Table seven over here is vacant.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.921
Fred, get up!

06:32.625 --> 06:36.584
I can't get no sleep around here today
to save my life.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.696
All right, young man.
I only have three rules:

06:41.768 --> 06:44.635
No spitting, no fighting, and use coasters.

06:49.308 --> 06:52.744
- All right, who wants some?
- I'll play.

06:53.045 --> 06:56.071
Step right up, my man. You can break.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.777
Want to put a little money on it
to make it interesting?

06:58.851 --> 07:00.944
No, my man, just playing for fun.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.659
What the hey. Maybe just $5 a ball.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.372
- Who wants some?
- I do.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.142
So you want to play me, my brother?

08:05.218 --> 08:07.709
Since you done beat all the suckers
at this table...

08:07.787 --> 08:11.450
maybe you'd like to try your luck
over here with the big boys.

08:13.259 --> 08:16.319
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.
My game is all that.

08:17.897 --> 08:21.333
All right then, 20 a ball is what we shoot.

08:21.701 --> 08:25.501
Wait a minute. What, $20 a ball?

08:25.905 --> 08:27.930
You in the big leagues now, boy.

08:28.541 --> 08:31.203
What's wrong?
No confidence in your game?

08:31.611 --> 08:34.375
- No, that ain't it.
- Then what is it?

08:34.580 --> 08:38.140
You look like
the king of the hill around here.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.144
You can take him, kid.

08:42.421 --> 08:44.582
Give him some, Will.

08:48.995 --> 08:52.624
I really wouldn't want to do
what I know I can do...

08:52.698 --> 08:54.393
if you know what I mean.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.700
No, I don't know what you mean.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.934
- Why don't you tell me?
- I know what he means.

09:03.442 --> 09:04.409
You do?

09:04.477 --> 09:07.605
It don't take a genius
to understand the boy.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.478
He say in plain English
that he didn't want to embarrass...

09:10.550 --> 09:13.348
your ugly behind up here
in front of these girls.

09:13.686 --> 09:14.744
I didn't...

09:14.820 --> 09:17.880
He also said that if it weren't for the fact
that he had won...

09:17.957 --> 09:21.757
so much from that fool over there,
he'd take your money, too.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.991
Thank you very much
for clearing that up for us, Fred.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.764
All right then, my brother, rack them.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.138
Well, my brother...

10:07.540 --> 10:10.202
Iooks like you owe me
a nice little piece of change...

10:10.276 --> 10:12.608
like 500 big ones.

10:12.912 --> 10:16.245
- $500?
- And 10ยบ% for his manager.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.549
Wait. Y'all hustled me.

10:19.652 --> 10:22.086
Hustled is such an ugly word.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.686
I prefer to think of it
as creative money management.

10:27.226 --> 10:30.821
- Now hand it over.
- All I got is $200.

10:30.896 --> 10:33.763
No, that ain't all you got.

10:34.233 --> 10:38.670
I seem to recall you
driving up here in a Benz.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.372
Hold it, wait. That car ain't even mine.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.937
You are so right, my brother.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.243
It's mine.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.391
Hi, sweetie, where are you going?

11:03.996 --> 11:07.022
Kimberly's mom is picking me up.
I'm going to the party.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.067
What kind of party?

11:10.603 --> 11:12.730
Sarah's birthday party.
Mom told you about it.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.670
And who's going to be there?

11:14.774 --> 11:19.177
- Courtney, Priscilla, Maggie, David, Josh...
- Wait. Let's just hold it right there...

11:19.245 --> 11:20.872
with David and Josh, young lady.

11:20.946 --> 11:24.040
I was not informed
that there would be boys at this party.

11:24.116 --> 11:26.482
I really don't like the sound of this.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.646
All my friends are going to be there.

11:28.721 --> 11:32.657
And if all your friends jumped off a cliff,
would you do it, too?

11:33.959 --> 11:36.257
- That's my ride. Bye.
- And no running in the house.

11:36.328 --> 11:38.023
You'll put your eye out.

11:41.333 --> 11:45.099
- Hilary, I'm in big trouble. I need your help.
- What's wrong?

11:45.171 --> 11:48.470
- I just need $300.
- $300? What for?

11:48.541 --> 11:49.735
Hey, young blood.

11:50.676 --> 11:55.340
Man! Y'all sure got it going on up in here.

11:57.249 --> 12:00.514
- Will, who is he?
- He's from the pool hall.

12:00.586 --> 12:03.077
I just lost a couple games and I need $300.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.784
You blew $300 and you don't even have
a sweater to show for it.

12:08.527 --> 12:10.017
Will, I was put in charge of you.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.961
When Mom finds out, she's gonna kill me.

12:12.031 --> 12:15.057
She won't find out
if you just get me the money.

12:15.434 --> 12:17.163
Okay, just let me go look.

12:21.307 --> 12:24.299
My man, Fred. Tell you what...

12:24.376 --> 12:27.539
have a seat here, I'll see if I can borrow
that money from my butler.

12:27.613 --> 12:29.308
That's what I always do.

12:53.572 --> 12:54.903
Cocktails!

12:58.377 --> 12:59.901
Who the hell are you?

13:01.046 --> 13:04.277
My name is Fred Lomax, Jr.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.609
And I presume you're Will's butler.

13:06.685 --> 13:09.415
So you can fix me a Rob Roy
with a Sidecar.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.018
You're one of Will's friends.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.124
- Yeah.
- Get out.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.757
Man, it is hard to find good help
these days.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.160
Mr. Lomax, I'm not the butler...

13:22.234 --> 13:24.566
but I'd be most happy
to show you the door.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.231
That's mighty kind of you, big daddy...

13:27.339 --> 13:31.173
but I can't go back to that pool hall
without that $300.

13:31.510 --> 13:32.875
$300?

13:35.014 --> 13:36.504
Uncle Phil.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.517
I see you've met
my Earth Science teacher.

13:42.121 --> 13:45.386
That's right.
He was not exactly hospitable...

13:45.457 --> 13:48.187
so I'm leaving. But if you ever want
to see that car again...

13:48.260 --> 13:50.387
you better come up with that $300.

13:51.697 --> 13:55.189
You went to the pool hall and lost the car?

13:55.267 --> 13:56.757
Uncle Phil, I'm sorry.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.828
I know you told me that I shouldn't go.
They hustled me.

13:59.905 --> 14:02.430
They're holding the car
until I pay them their money.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.840
- Uncle Phil, I'm really...
- Stupid?

14:04.944 --> 14:06.707
I know that, Will.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.304
I'll deal with you later.
We got to get that car back.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.508
Uncle Phil, you can't go down there
by yourself.

14:11.584 --> 14:12.915
You can't handle those dudes.

14:12.985 --> 14:16.045
They got guys in there
that make you look like Webster.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.182
If there are hooligans there,
I should accompany you.

14:21.460 --> 14:25.590
In the early '80s,
I was sparring butler for Mr. Chuck Norris.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.437
You sure you know what you're doing?

14:37.509 --> 14:41.502
Absolutely. This is strictly a legal matter
between me and the management.

14:43.315 --> 14:46.250
You're back. You better have that money.

14:47.653 --> 14:49.382
Well!

14:51.090 --> 14:52.682
Hello, handsome.

14:54.059 --> 14:57.051
Madam, our car has been
illegally impounded...

14:57.129 --> 15:00.621
in this establishment.
And if it's not returned immediately...

15:00.699 --> 15:03.259
I will be forced
to take serious legal action...

15:03.335 --> 15:05.633
and have your license revoked.

15:05.704 --> 15:09.504
That's where we got you fooled.
We ain't got no license.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.540
Uncle Phil, I don't think
all this legal stuff is going to work.

15:16.615 --> 15:20.711
The only legal phrase these people know
is, "Will the defendant please rise."

15:21.520 --> 15:23.750
Will, who's the guy who beat you?

15:25.257 --> 15:26.849
That dude right there.

15:27.693 --> 15:30.355
All right, pal. I'm here to get the car.

15:30.796 --> 15:34.493
Seems to me
there's a small matter of $300, pal.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.758
I'm not giving you one cent.

15:36.902 --> 15:40.303
All right. You want to wipe out the debt?

15:40.706 --> 15:43.334
You can play for it. $20 a ball.

15:44.510 --> 15:47.479
Uncle Phil, don't fall for it.
That's exactly how they got me.

15:47.546 --> 15:49.104
Will, I'm not an idiot.

15:49.181 --> 15:52.480
I'm not about to bet on some game
I've never played in my entire life.

15:52.551 --> 15:55.281
What's the matter, buddy.
Aren't you man enough?

16:00.059 --> 16:01.686
What did you say to me?

16:02.127 --> 16:05.619
Seems to me that you don't want to play
because you can't play.

16:06.665 --> 16:09.793
Can't play? You put the balls into the hole.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.029
How difficult can that be?
I've seen it on TV.

16:12.104 --> 16:16.734
That's right. All you got to do
is put the balls in the hole, just like on TV.

16:17.543 --> 16:20.307
I'll tell you what. I'll let you break.

16:21.547 --> 16:24.778
Geoffrey, get me one
of those stick thingies.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.019
At least he's got the terminology down.

16:33.392 --> 16:36.361
Sir, do you think this is wise?

16:36.595 --> 16:39.428
Don't be ridiculous, Geoffrey.
It's simple geometry.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.209
That was just a practice shot.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.252
Looks like it's my turn.

17:28.146 --> 17:31.207
Now you owe me $400.

17:33.485 --> 17:35.715
Uncle Phil, can you just pay him
and let's go?

17:35.788 --> 17:38.518
No, I think I'm getting a lot better,
don't you?

17:39.591 --> 17:41.058
Much better.

17:41.126 --> 17:43.993
That's not how I see it. You still stink.

17:46.532 --> 17:47.897
I wouldn't talk.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.899
Wait a minute.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.004
Let's play another game.
I want another chance.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.203
Uncle Phil!

17:59.411 --> 18:02.778
I don't know. My time is very valuable.

18:03.082 --> 18:07.143
I couldn't possibly play another game
without upping the ante.

18:07.719 --> 18:08.845
How much?

18:08.954 --> 18:12.651
Let's say, a nice, round figure
like $100 a ball.

18:14.726 --> 18:16.421
$100 a ball?

18:16.829 --> 18:18.558
That's right, Uncle Phil.

18:20.666 --> 18:23.362
Okay. $100 a ball.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.895
You got yourself a game.

18:28.073 --> 18:30.769
Geoffrey? Break out Lucille.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.937
$600, $700...

19:39.511 --> 19:42.969
$800, $900.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.848
And 10ยบ% for his manager.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.245
Oh, it's gonna be like that, my brother...

19:52.958 --> 19:55.188
after you done had me up in your house.

19:58.096 --> 20:00.087
Let this be a lesson to you.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.030
Don't mess with my boy again.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.762
You mess with him,
you're messing with me.

20:19.084 --> 20:20.176
Yeah!

20:26.658 --> 20:29.821
- Hi, Hilary.
- Mother, you're back. How was your trip?

20:29.895 --> 20:32.295
Fine. How was your weekend
with the kids?

20:32.431 --> 20:34.365
- It went great.
- Really?

20:34.533 --> 20:37.502
I've got to tell you,
even though I wanted to do this...

20:37.569 --> 20:41.733
deep down I had a lot of anxiety
about taking on this kind of responsibility.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.935
Now that I've been through it,
I can honestly say...

20:45.010 --> 20:47.570
I handled it, I prevailed...

20:47.713 --> 20:50.682
and now I think I'm ready
to have children of my own.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.352
That's great, Hilary.
So, where are the kids?

20:55.487 --> 20:57.182
What, you mean like now?

20:57.990 --> 20:59.321
- Mom!
- Mommy!

20:59.391 --> 21:03.088
- Thank God you're home!
- What's the matter?

21:03.161 --> 21:06.324
- Hilary was a tyrant all weekend.
- She was terrible.

21:06.398 --> 21:10.562
Next time you go out of town, I beg of you,
please just put food and water in a dish.

21:11.903 --> 21:15.066
Someday you'll have children of your own,
and then you'll understand.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.540
- Baby.
- Hi.

21:21.346 --> 21:25.282
- How was your lecture?
- They loved it. How was your weekend?

21:25.384 --> 21:27.352
Fine. I got a lot of work done.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.011
Finished up a little early tonight...

21:29.087 --> 21:31.647
so Will and I had a chance
to spend some time together.

21:31.723 --> 21:32.815
We had fun.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.223
You two got along?

21:36.962 --> 21:39.658
It figures you'd choose
the weekend I was away.

21:39.898 --> 21:42.560
I'm exhausted and I am going to bed.

21:43.001 --> 21:44.866
- Good night.
- Night, Aunt Viv.

21:44.936 --> 21:47.097
I'll be up in a minute, sweetheart.

21:47.906 --> 21:50.272
How come you didn't
tell her what really happened?

21:50.342 --> 21:54.039
Because I don't want her to worry about it.
It's between you and me.

21:55.113 --> 21:59.379
Do you think she'll put two and two
together when the cops dig my body up.

22:05.824 --> 22:08.054
Don't give me any ideas, Will.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.124
I just have one question.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.520
Why are you so hard-headed?

22:13.165 --> 22:15.326
Is that like a rhetorical question?

22:17.669 --> 22:21.036
You know, a hard head
makes for a soft behind.

22:21.907 --> 22:23.636
What, you're going to spank me?

22:24.743 --> 22:27.371
You know the severity
of what you did tonight.

22:27.779 --> 22:30.509
We're going to discuss
your punishment tomorrow.

22:30.949 --> 22:33.076
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

22:34.586 --> 22:36.213
And, Uncle Phil?

22:36.955 --> 22:39.651
I just wanted to say
thanks for coming to the pool hall...

22:39.725 --> 22:41.522
and saving my butt tonight.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.921
I ain't seen too many people
shoot like that.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.327
Where did you learn?

22:46.398 --> 22:50.300
Let's just say, I've spent time
in a pool hall or two in my life.

22:50.802 --> 22:52.201
I know what goes on there.

22:52.270 --> 22:55.262
Which is why I don't want you
going down there in the first place.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.501
You think I want to spoil your fun?

22:57.576 --> 23:00.170
I just want you to come home
in one piece.

23:00.679 --> 23:01.941
That's decent.

23:03.448 --> 23:07.384
I also want to thank you
for winning my money back.

23:11.123 --> 23:14.456
Your money? I'll play you for it.
