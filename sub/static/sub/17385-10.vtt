When I was 10 years old, in L.A. in 1966,

I noticed, uh, Neil Hamilton
was walking down the street

03:07.261 --> 03:09.294

03:09.396 --> 03:12.064

take my name and address,

a coupla weeks later

03:22.042 --> 03:24.409

I gotta tell you, I
cannot do this book justice

08:36.086 --> 08:38.653
just describing it. It looked amazing.

08:38.755 --> 08:41.356
Bright colors, spine was immaculate.

08:41.457 --> 08:44.025
I mean, we're talking about
a book that came out in 1939.

08:44.126 --> 08:45.894
- Yeah.
- Through all those decades,

08:45.996 --> 08:47.962
all that turmoil the world has seen,

08:48.064 --> 08:50.398
this book remained unchanged.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.134
It wasn't like somebody
carried it on the battlefield.

08:53.236 --> 08:55.470
[laughter]

08:55.572 --> 08:57.505
Oh, man.

08:57.607 --> 08:59.174
I could just stare at it all day long.

08:59.276 --> 09:01.242
And I would let you, but
I have to go to the city.

09:01.344 --> 09:03.244
Do you think we can get
maybe get a picture with it?

09:03.346 --> 09:05.213
- Sure, I've got my phone.
- All right.

09:05.315 --> 09:06.648
Can you just flip it around for us?

09:06.750 --> 09:08.149
So it's, like, facing the camera.

09:08.251 --> 09:09.818
What are you gonna do,
lay down on the counter?

09:09.920 --> 09:11.052
- Just pick it up.
- Whoa!

09:11.154 --> 09:13.388
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Pick it up.

09:13.490 --> 09:14.856
- All right.
- Ah.

09:14.958 --> 09:16.491
Do, like, "The Price Is Right" thing, man.

09:16.593 --> 09:18.226
Like you're showing it off.

09:18.328 --> 09:20.428
There you go.

09:20.530 --> 09:21.663
Thanks for coming, Chris,

09:21.765 --> 09:23.164

- It was an honor. Thank you.

11:25.056 --> 11:27.056

- Oh!

- The one...
- Yeah.

11:28.226 --> 11:29.191
Where it unfolded

11:29.293 --> 11:30.359
and they hid behind it.

11:30.461 --> 11:31.560

that it was in shops

13:22.441 --> 13:23.574

13:23.676 --> 13:24.575
and sold out to the kids

13:24.677 --> 13:25.876

13:25.978 --> 13:27.478

13:52.505 --> 13:53.704

13:53.806 --> 13:55.372
but then it all just kind of went away.

13:55.474 --> 13:56.440
And I remember at the time,

13:56.542 --> 13:57.608
there was a lot of people going,

13:57.710 --> 13:58.943
"No, that's not my Penguin.

13:59.045 --> 14:00.077
I don't like that. "
[laughs]

14:00.179 --> 14:01.879
Why, with comic book fans,

14:01.981 --> 14:04.248
are they so married to, like-

14:04.350 --> 14:05.616
Well, you say, like,
"That's not my Penguin. "

14:05.718 --> 14:08.252
Because your Penguin is the Penguin

14:08.354 --> 14:09.286
you grew up with,

14:09.388 --> 14:11.622
and the Penguin I grew up with

14:11.724 --> 14:12.623
was Burgess Meredith.

14:12.725 --> 14:13.924
"Wah, wah, wah, wah. "

14:14.026 --> 14:15.626
Like you're the curmudgeonly old guy

14:15.728 --> 14:17.861
that's like, "My Penguin used
to have a cigarette holder

14:17.964 --> 14:18.862
and go, 'Wah, wah, wah. "

14:18.965 --> 14:20.130
And then people'd be like,

14:20.233 --> 14:22.366
"You have a penguin?" [laughter]

14:22.468 --> 14:23.367
Every generation has a penguin.

14:23.469 --> 14:25.135

14:25.238 --> 14:26.770

14:37.016 --> 14:38.115

14:40.353 --> 14:42.886

14:42.989 --> 14:44.388
a Godzilla banner.

14:44.490 --> 14:46.156

14:46.259 --> 14:47.891

14:47.994 --> 14:49.159
so that nothing happens to them.

14:49.262 --> 14:50.728

14:50.830 --> 14:52.429
The only cloth I'll give you on a poster

14:52.531 --> 14:54.231
is, like, a black light poster, right?

14:56.202 --> 14:57.234

14:57.336 --> 14:58.235
When we were little?

14:58.337 --> 14:59.670
Okay, Farrah Fawcett.

14:59.772 --> 15:01.138
You would rather have
a Farrah Fawcett banner?

15:01.240 --> 15:03.307

that image on a banner!

15:03.409 --> 15:04.908
Why? [laughing]

15:05.011 --> 15:06.610
'Cause we all had that
poster. Do we have it now?

15:06.712 --> 15:08.012
I don't think we'd
have the banners either.

15:08.114 --> 15:09.580
Well, I have all my
banners. I saved them all.

15:09.682 --> 15:11.081
Yeah, they're rolled up in tubes. Yeah.

15:11.183 --> 15:12.516

15:12.618 --> 15:14.018
All right.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.320

to add to my collection.

15:16.422 --> 15:17.421
Okay.

15:17.523 --> 15:18.856
What do you need to get for it?

15:18.958 --> 15:21.258
Well, you clearly are interested in it,

15:21.360 --> 15:24.194
so I'm thinking, you know, $200.

15:24.297 --> 15:25.996
Now I'm gonna point
out some of those defects,

15:26.098 --> 15:27.831
maybe where I didn't
you know[laughs]

15:27.933 --> 15:29.833
Initially, I didn't, but-

15:29.935 --> 15:31.335
Here's why it's not as good as a poster.

15:31.437 --> 15:33.003
[laughter]

15:33.105 --> 15:36.006

come from a smoker's home.

15:36.108 --> 15:37.841

15:37.943 --> 15:38.976
All right.

15:39.078 --> 15:41.111
Is there any way you could do...

15:41.213 --> 15:42.946
$140?

15:43.049 --> 15:44.214
Couldn't do $140.

15:44.317 --> 15:47.618
I could come down to, like, $175.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.053
