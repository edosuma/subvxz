01:40.575 --> 01:43.311
You don't get no allowance
until you beat me. Got it?

01:45.347 --> 01:47.784
- I don't play.
- Fine.

01:47.817 --> 01:49.952
I could use $5 anyway
for snacks.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.623
Let's go.

01:55.925 --> 01:59.061
You know my first move.

02:12.842 --> 02:13.843
All right.

02:34.997 --> 02:36.732
Come on,
you look a little scared.

02:40.069 --> 02:41.436
No, I'm not.

02:44.807 --> 02:46.976
Check.

02:47.009 --> 02:48.711
Now, go wash that bowl
you dirtied.

02:52.414 --> 02:53.950
Man, you always
on the fucking couch, man.

03:00.488 --> 03:01.724
Yo, Jason.

03:05.027 --> 03:06.028
Yo, Lou, I gotta bounce.

03:07.897 --> 03:09.531
- I gotta go to Lamar.
- I got you.

04:26.008 --> 04:27.609
Yo. Hey, yo!

04:28.244 --> 04:29.745
Yo, yo, yo!

04:31.948 --> 04:33.783
Hey, you ain't seen me running back there?
Come on now.

04:33.816 --> 04:34.984
You got a pass?

04:38.988 --> 04:40.089
You're not really
gonna try and give me

04:40.122 --> 04:42.590
a used lunchtime pass
this early in the morning now?

04:45.795 --> 04:47.697
That's fuckin' cold.

04:47.730 --> 04:49.664
- And no eating on the jitney!
- Mmm-hmm.

04:56.638 --> 04:57.974
What's up, Sed?

04:58.841 --> 04:59.942
Same old.

05:00.843 --> 05:01.944
How's your pops?

05:03.713 --> 05:04.780
Same old.

05:06.614 --> 05:07.783
Anything I could do?

05:09.318 --> 05:11.954
I'll take a piece of that
sandwich if you're offering, shit.

05:11.988 --> 05:14.724
You see, I would though, but Ray already
skimped me on the platanos, dawg,

05:14.757 --> 05:15.791
so I can't even
be going that way.

05:15.825 --> 05:16.726
I got these pythons to feed.

05:16.759 --> 05:19.561
Fat-ass. Whatever, man.
All right, man.

05:20.696 --> 05:21.563
Yo, Ito,
wait up, man.

05:21.596 --> 05:24.100
- Speed up, Sed.
- Wait up.

05:24.133 --> 05:26.068
Drag your fat ass through.
You hear me?

05:26.102 --> 05:27.737
Man, slow down.

05:41.649 --> 05:44.053
What?

05:44.086 --> 05:45.087
Nothing,
just don't look at the board.

05:45.121 --> 05:47.256
- Huh?
- Just don't look at the board.

05:50.059 --> 05:52.228
Come on, who's the wise guy?
Who's the wise guy?

05:52.261 --> 05:53.362
Are you guys
ever gonna grow up?

05:53.396 --> 05:57.767
- Nope. Not this year.
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

05:57.800 --> 06:01.103
All right, now, people, this is
gonna be very basic for some of you,

06:01.137 --> 06:04.206
but for the fish,
or the newbies as I like to call you,

06:04.240 --> 06:05.107
this is gonna be eye-opening

06:05.141 --> 06:09.845
because what you've got
is 64 squares,

06:09.879 --> 06:13.983
32 pieces, it doesn't matter
how rich or poor you are,

06:14.016 --> 06:16.986
what Ivy League school you
may go or you may not go to,

06:17.019 --> 06:19.587
what prison you hopefully
never set foot in,

06:19.621 --> 06:23.591
because chess
is the great equalizer.

06:23.625 --> 06:27.730
Okay, now in the opening,
white always moves first.

06:27.763 --> 06:30.665
Now, I wonder what old white
guy thought of that rule, right?

06:30.699 --> 06:33.102
I know you hear me.

06:33.135 --> 06:35.037
So, white has
multiple openings,

06:35.071 --> 06:36.739
depending on his
opponent's strength.

06:36.772 --> 06:40.176
Then black is gonna counter
with a choice of defenses,

06:40.209 --> 06:43.345
- and then you're off to the races, my friends.
- Oi, oi, oi.

06:43.379 --> 06:45.781
Hear what I said?

06:45.815 --> 06:48.084
Hey, Mr. Medina.
Nice of you to show up, my man.

06:48.117 --> 06:50.986
- You are so very welcome, Mr. T.
- Where were you?

06:51.020 --> 06:52.254
I was in the yard.

06:52.288 --> 06:53.422
I was playing a couple of
fishies for their lunch money.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.758
Come on, man.
Please don't tell me you're gambling.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.226
The last thing I need
is for Kestel to come in

06:57.259 --> 06:59.061
and give me grief
for that too. Come on!

06:59.095 --> 07:00.296
My bad. Check me out.

07:00.329 --> 07:02.131
Look, these underrated matches
ain't getting us nowhere, Mr. T.

07:02.164 --> 07:05.234
- "Aren't." Aren't getting us anywhere, Roddy.
- Aren't.

07:05.267 --> 07:07.970
And since when are you too good
to play your peers, huh, man?

07:08.003 --> 07:10.372
- They aren't our peers anymore.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:10.406 --> 07:12.775
So, now... Now you think
you can go up against people

07:12.808 --> 07:15.311
who've been playing since they
were in diapers? Okay, okay.

07:15.344 --> 07:16.979
Hold on, hold on.
Check me out.

07:17.012 --> 07:18.781
Ain't no diapers here, Mr. T.
Don't do me like that.

07:18.814 --> 07:21.350
Please, please sit down, sit down.

07:21.383 --> 07:23.719
Good to know.
Just sit down, please. Sit down.

07:23.752 --> 07:26.288
I'll never be able
to unsee that. That's...

07:26.322 --> 07:29.758
All right, people,
so the first proof today is gonna be

07:29.792 --> 07:36.098
the Scandinavian Defense.

07:36.132 --> 07:39.201
And it goes a little something like
this, all right?

07:39.235 --> 07:45.107
So, white plays e4,
black attacks aggressively to d5.

07:45.141 --> 07:48.844
And then
black pawn down. Okay?

07:48.878 --> 07:51.213
So, the queen violently takes.

07:51.247 --> 07:54.250
Now, this breaks
all the rules for beginners

07:54.283 --> 07:56.785
because you never bring out
your queen too early.

07:56.819 --> 07:58.787
Roddy, what's the other rule?

07:58.821 --> 08:01.824
Um, you never move the same
piece twice in an opening.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.059
- Duh.
- Thank you, thank you. Beautiful.

08:04.093 --> 08:05.861
And now,
let's do it over again.

08:15.771 --> 08:17.907
And what do you make of that,
Mr. Paniagua?

08:19.742 --> 08:20.743
- Yo, get the fuck outta here.
- Did you wake up?

08:20.776 --> 08:22.811
He's ordering platanos
in his dreams and shit.

08:22.845 --> 08:25.915
Oh, hey. Hey, watch the mouth,
watch the mouth.

08:25.948 --> 08:28.017
Mr. T, please,
just cut me some slack.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.985
I was working
mad late the whole night.

08:30.019 --> 08:32.321
If I was your boss, I would,
but I'm your teacher

08:32.354 --> 08:35.291
in the easiest elective
in the history of electives.

08:35.324 --> 08:38.294
How much more slack
would you like, Mr. Paniagua?

08:38.327 --> 08:41.430
Huh? Just show up, stay awake
and you pass, man.

08:41.463 --> 08:44.066
- Little more?
- No, come here, come here, come here.

08:44.099 --> 08:47.303
Come up and show me your best opening.
Come on, stud, crush me.

08:47.336 --> 08:48.504
Come on, big shot.

08:48.537 --> 08:49.672
- This is why I was sleeping.
- Come on, big shot.

08:49.705 --> 08:51.307
This is why I was sleeping
'cause I was saving it for this.

08:51.340 --> 08:55.277
- Watch what's gonna happen.
- I'll call you out next so don't play. Don't play.

08:55.311 --> 08:57.246
- E, V4. Boom.
- Very basic.

08:57.279 --> 08:59.748
So, I'm gonna call you out
on little basics as well.

08:59.782 --> 09:01.984
- Basic to basic.
- Oh. Okay, okay.

09:02.017 --> 09:03.485
- That's fancy. You wanna see some defense?
- Oh, look at that.

09:03.519 --> 09:06.755
Developing a bishop instead of the knight.
Somebody's paying attention.

09:06.789 --> 09:10.192
- I should be teaching actually.
- So, I'm gonna counter with this little defensive move.

09:10.226 --> 09:12.394
- What you got? What you got?
- Okay, that's good.

09:12.428 --> 09:15.064
- But I already got this.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:15.097 --> 09:17.399
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.235
- Why no?
- No, he's trying to scholar's mate me.

09:19.268 --> 09:22.371
Hey, come on.
Trying to scholar's mate me?

09:22.404 --> 09:25.541
You do that, and I'll chase your
queen all over the damn board, man.

09:25.574 --> 09:27.443
- Oh, okay.
- Save that for some fish. All right, guys, guys.

09:29.578 --> 09:32.514
Hey, hey, can you go over the
Legal's mate again for me, please?

09:32.548 --> 09:33.882
- Can you do that?
- I got you, Mr. Martinez.

09:36.051 --> 09:39.154
All right, so, uh,
what do we have here?

09:39.188 --> 09:43.192
Rivera here refused to answer Mr. Rochelle,
then he took a swing at him.

09:43.225 --> 09:45.828
Oh, whoa, whoa,
Mr. Trouble.

09:45.861 --> 09:49.565
Come on, go inside and wait by my
desk, all right? Come on.

09:49.598 --> 09:52.134
- Hey, that new kid look weird.
- Go, go.

09:52.167 --> 09:53.502
- Thank you.
- What's good.

09:55.337 --> 09:57.406
Come on, man.
Come on.

09:57.439 --> 10:00.042
My class is not detention,
Miss Kestel.

10:00.075 --> 10:01.110
- No?
- No.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.979
No, I'm running a legitimate
elective here, okay?

10:04.013 --> 10:05.247
These kids
have real potential.

10:05.281 --> 10:07.283
Hello?

10:07.316 --> 10:09.285
Okay, well,
they're not what you think they are.

10:09.318 --> 10:11.920
I mean...
Well, maybe that one is.

10:11.954 --> 10:13.322
- Oh.
- Come on, come on.

10:13.355 --> 10:15.090
Guys, guys, please,
a little respect.

10:15.624 --> 10:17.826
Man. Whatever, man.

10:17.860 --> 10:20.296
As long as their ranking
and our G.R. goes up,

10:20.329 --> 10:23.299
you can have them playing
marbles for all I care.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.134
And I got you
this elective.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.469
So, if I need a babysitter
because some kid is messing

10:27.503 --> 10:30.039
with another kid's chances
of actually graduating,

10:30.072 --> 10:31.307
I expect
you'll accommodate me.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.008
I do, I do.
I got your back.

10:33.042 --> 10:34.176
- I do.
- Great.

10:34.209 --> 10:37.246
And as attendance has been
your one area of true greatness,

10:37.279 --> 10:38.947
I'd suggest you focus
more on the fact

10:38.981 --> 10:40.849
that it's dipped
this past month.

10:40.883 --> 10:42.918
Well, a student was deported.

10:42.951 --> 10:46.422
I'm sorry, but Immigration has a way
of messing with attendance numbers.

10:46.455 --> 10:49.091
Just keep the bodies
in the seats.

10:49.124 --> 10:51.427
Well, look, if you hired me
just to fill up bilingual quota,

10:51.460 --> 10:53.228
you're underestimating me, okay?

10:53.262 --> 10:54.930
And more importantly, them.

10:54.963 --> 10:57.199
Just keep the bodies
in the seats.

10:57.232 --> 10:58.867
You know, I'm a good teacher.

11:00.903 --> 11:02.137
I am a good teacher.

11:04.239 --> 11:06.241
- Paniagua.
- Here.

11:09.278 --> 11:10.512
So, Rivera?

11:15.217 --> 11:17.886
Well, remaining silent, I mean,
it certainly is your prerogative.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.421
Again,
T droppin' some Bobby Brown.

11:19.455 --> 11:20.556
Can you not?

11:22.424 --> 11:24.426
Oh, yeah, okay.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.061
That makes sense.

11:36.605 --> 11:37.606
Cool?

11:37.639 --> 11:41.176
Now, Michael, you got
two choices here, okay?

11:41.210 --> 11:43.112
One, do nothing,

11:43.145 --> 11:45.080
or play chess.

11:50.953 --> 11:52.488
I swear. I swear
there's gonna be one day

11:52.521 --> 11:55.257
one student says,
"Yes, Mr. Martinez, chess!"

11:55.290 --> 11:56.658
Of course, yeah.

11:56.693 --> 11:58.360
All right, guys.
Hey, guys, guys.

11:58.394 --> 12:00.562
I want you to review
scholar's mate for me

12:00.596 --> 12:02.364
- on your own, all right?
- Shit.

12:02.398 --> 12:05.667
What, I have to listen to
Ito's Haitian music to be cool?
