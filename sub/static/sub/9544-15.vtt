00:26.886 --> 00:28.897
Hello, I'm calling on
behalf of Natalie Teeger,

00:28.898 --> 00:31.118
who's running for the school
board in your district.

00:31.153 --> 00:32.511
Are you registered to vote?

00:32.546 --> 00:34.598
Oh, my goodness.

00:34.633 --> 00:37.136
I just love that sign in the window.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.538
Who... Who made the sign,
do you know?

00:38.573 --> 00:42.114
- Her daughter.
- Oh, it's so colorful!

00:42.149 --> 00:43.974
- Where should I put these?
- I don't know.

00:44.009 --> 00:45.007
Oh, well.

00:45.042 --> 00:46.975
You know, I've never run
for anything in my life,

00:47.010 --> 00:49.025
but I just got so angry.

00:49.060 --> 00:51.590
You know, My daughter
Julie goes to Ashton,

00:51.591 --> 00:54.235
and I love it. It is
such a wonderful school.

00:54.270 --> 00:56.608
But they want to close it and
consolidate it with the high school,

00:56.643 --> 00:59.190
- which would be such a huge mistake.
- Piece-of-crap copier.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.158
Could you excuse me for one second?

01:01.193 --> 01:03.728
I'll be right back.
Just one second.

01:03.763 --> 01:05.756
All right, tell me something good.

01:05.791 --> 01:09.931
You know, this company, Tazarr, went
out of business, which is a good thing.

01:09.966 --> 01:11.960
Where did you get it?

01:11.995 --> 01:15.092
Uh, at a police auction.
They just delivered it this morning.

01:15.127 --> 01:17.787
I got the fax machine and
the computer there, too.

01:17.822 --> 01:20.727
- They don't work either.
- Well, you get what you pay for.

01:20.772 --> 01:23.192
Here's your problem.
The primary feeder is jammed.

01:23.227 --> 01:25.841
There's somethin' in there,
I can't get to it. See?

01:25.876 --> 01:26.768
- It's locked.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:26.803 --> 01:28.649
Did they give you a key for this?

01:28.684 --> 01:30.714
Oh, yeah, I think so.
Let me check.

01:30.749 --> 01:34.085
Oh. Vote Teeger.

01:41.547 --> 01:44.121
Hello. Uh, I'm with the Fairfield Eagle.

01:44.156 --> 01:46.125
We're doing a story on the election.

01:46.160 --> 01:48.369
Why did you decide to volunteer?

01:48.404 --> 01:50.622
I'm not a volunteer.

01:50.657 --> 01:52.628
I'm her boss.

01:52.663 --> 01:54.413
That's an interesting angle.

01:54.448 --> 01:59.037
Not every boss would allow his
employee time off to run for office.

01:59.072 --> 02:02.082
Well, I didn't have a choice.

02:02.117 --> 02:04.554
She just said she was doing it.

02:04.589 --> 02:06.110
Got it.

02:07.342 --> 02:11.143
Now, what do you think is the most
important issue in this campaign?

02:13.387 --> 02:17.329
For me, there's really only one issue here.

02:17.364 --> 02:23.161
If Natalie wins,
who will take care of me?

02:25.959 --> 02:30.617
No, I'm asking you. Who?

02:30.652 --> 02:34.488
- Do you know? No.
- No, sorry.

02:34.523 --> 02:37.186
Not even close.

02:37.221 --> 02:38.534
Can't... Can't you just break it open?

02:38.569 --> 02:42.230
I only need if for five days.
The election is on Tuesday.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.954
Watch out! Watch out!

02:55.061 --> 02:57.242
Get down! Get down!

03:01.961 --> 03:04.759
Natalie, get down!

03:17.534 --> 03:19.938
MONK Season 3 Epi. 15
Mr. Monk and the Election

04:36.742 --> 04:38.541
Hey, Monk.

04:38.576 --> 04:41.116
- I got you. I got you.
- All right.

04:56.319 --> 04:58.158
How's Natalie doing?

04:58.193 --> 05:02.408
She's scared to death.

05:02.443 --> 05:04.945
So, the security guard?

05:04.980 --> 05:06.856
Yeah, wrong place, wrong time.

05:06.891 --> 05:08.879
Hmm, where was the shooter?

05:08.914 --> 05:10.699
Right over here.

05:10.734 --> 05:15.329
You can kind of see an impression
in the tar paper, but... Well, uh...

05:15.364 --> 05:16.843
How are the footprints?

05:16.878 --> 05:19.603
Unusable. The witnesses are
all over the map, too.

05:19.638 --> 05:22.696
Some say they heard five shots,
some say nine.

05:22.731 --> 05:26.567
14. There were 14 shots.

05:26.602 --> 05:29.641
You sure?
Of course you're sure.

05:29.676 --> 05:32.379
How did they come?
Were they evenly spaced?

05:32.414 --> 05:34.241
Bang.

05:34.276 --> 05:35.696
Bang, bang.

05:35.731 --> 05:37.455
Bang.

05:37.490 --> 05:39.870
- Bang, bang, bang, bang.
- Rapid fire, semi-automatic.

05:39.905 --> 05:41.366
We haven't found any shells.

05:41.401 --> 05:43.147
Guy did a pretty good cleanup job.

05:43.182 --> 05:46.457
Well, maybe he's done this before.

05:47.302 --> 05:49.530
Monk, what do you got?

05:49.565 --> 05:52.108
Well, the...

05:52.143 --> 05:55.762
The roof slants
at a weird angle right here.

05:55.797 --> 05:57.886
Do you have a bullet?

06:14.273 --> 06:16.745
He missed one.

06:16.780 --> 06:20.798
It's a 7.62. AK?

06:20.833 --> 06:24.352
Yeah, Kalashnikov. Russian.
That's somethin'.

06:24.387 --> 06:26.917
Call Grooms at the Bureau,
and the ATF.

06:26.952 --> 06:28.958
Maybe they have an idea.

06:28.993 --> 06:32.077
Captain, we found something.
You might want to check it out.

06:32.112 --> 06:34.387
What you got?

06:37.021 --> 06:39.498
Looks like a note.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.423
"Natalie Teeger must withdraw."

06:45.458 --> 06:47.511
Son of a bitch,
he was after Natalie.

06:47.546 --> 06:48.967
Well, that doesn't make sense.

06:49.002 --> 06:52.002
It's just a school board election.
I mean, who cares?

06:52.037 --> 06:53.825
He spelled her name wrong.

06:53.860 --> 06:55.684
He was probably in a rush.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.589
I don't think so.

06:57.624 --> 07:01.793
It looks like he took his time.
He dotted all the "I's," crossed the "T's."

07:01.828 --> 07:06.724
- He spelled her name wrong.
- Whatever. Motive. Motive, motive.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.589
Let's start with the obvious.
Who's running against her?

07:09.624 --> 07:12.990
Yeah, I've got it right here.
Harold Jay Krenshaw.

07:13.025 --> 07:16.073
You've got to be kidding.
Harold Jay Krenshaw?

07:16.108 --> 07:17.873
He's running for school board?

07:17.908 --> 07:21.498
- You know him?
- He's a patient of Dr. Kroger's.

07:21.533 --> 07:26.703
Uh, I met him in the waiting room.
This guy has got some serious problems.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.587
He drives everybody he meets crazy.

07:29.622 --> 07:34.415
I mean, he's...
He's just...

07:35.768 --> 07:38.566
Nobody is accusing anybody
of anything here.

07:38.601 --> 07:41.612
This is just a friendly conversation.

07:41.647 --> 07:46.807
In fact, I bought some doughnuts.

07:48.872 --> 07:53.904
Mr. Krenshaw,
do you know why you're here?

07:53.939 --> 07:55.317
Well, it's pretty obvious.

07:55.352 --> 07:57.438
I'm running for school board
against Natalie Teeger

07:57.473 --> 07:59.710
and somebody took a shot at her.

07:59.745 --> 08:01.346
A security guard was killed.

08:01.381 --> 08:05.503
I heard about that.
I'm sorry.

08:05.538 --> 08:08.880
Do you own a gun, Mr. Krenshaw?

08:08.915 --> 08:15.085
Yes, I do.
My father was a... a hunter.

08:17.051 --> 08:20.339
He bought me a Remington rifle
when I was a kid.

08:20.374 --> 08:23.700
- Just the Remington?
- That's right.

08:23.735 --> 08:25.342
Are you a good shot?

08:25.377 --> 08:27.793
I'm an exceptional shot.

08:27.828 --> 08:32.159
Miss Teeger has decided to
drop out of the...

08:32.195 --> 08:33.899
Out of the race.

08:33.933 --> 08:35.947
How do you feel about that?

08:35.982 --> 08:38.426
Well, it doesn't matter.
She couldn't win anyway.

08:38.461 --> 08:39.371
Why?

08:39.405 --> 08:44.063
That school needs to be closed.
Everybody knows it.

08:44.099 --> 08:48.758
I'd be happy to take
a polygraph test if you want.

08:50.537 --> 08:53.029
What are you...
What are you doing?

08:55.157 --> 08:58.232
I'm eating a doughnut.
It's food.

08:58.267 --> 09:00.806
- W-Why that one?
- Because I like the coconut.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.454
- Now you have to eat a sugar one.
- I don't want a sugar one.

09:03.489 --> 09:07.437
Or you could take three
more coconuts and two chocolate.

09:07.472 --> 09:10.177
Or one coconut and two glazed.

09:10.212 --> 09:12.406
Or you could just eat them all.
That would probably be easier, huh?

09:12.441 --> 09:13.908
- That's a good idea.
- Probably be easiest.

09:13.943 --> 09:17.795
- Yeah.
- Or I could do this.

09:26.052 --> 09:27.507
There.

09:27.542 --> 09:29.943
Now there's one doughnut.

09:29.978 --> 09:33.010
One big damn doughnut.

09:33.045 --> 09:34.838
- You see what you did?
- Could we get back to this?

09:34.873 --> 09:39.409
Mr. Krenshaw, where were you
at 10:30 this morning?

09:39.444 --> 09:43.759
I was at Dr. Kroger's office.
I had my... my appointment.

09:43.794 --> 09:45.450
Your appointment ends at 10:00.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.981
It was a double session.

09:49.899 --> 09:53.171
Dr. Kroger doesn't do
double sessions anymore.

09:53.206 --> 09:54.823
I'm just telling you.

09:54.858 --> 09:58.952
He made an exception for me.

09:58.987 --> 10:00.977
If you don't believe me, call him.

10:01.012 --> 10:04.504
- Do you want his beeper number?
- I have his beeper number, okay?

10:04.539 --> 10:08.290
Well, if that doesn't work,
try his cell phone.

10:08.325 --> 10:11.104
- He gave you his cell phone number?
- Mmm-hmm.

10:11.139 --> 10:13.485
- That's a lie. He's lying, Captain.
- Hmm.

10:13.520 --> 10:16.340
'Cause Dr. Kroger would

10:16.375 --> 10:19.373
never give anybody his
cell phone number, ever. Not ever.

10:19.408 --> 10:20.949
Monk, I really don't care.

10:20.984 --> 10:22.487
I've been to his home.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.822
- Have you no shame?
- Excuse me.

10:24.857 --> 10:27.351
A man died today.

10:30.804 --> 10:34.605
- I met his daughter.
- Liar! Liar!

10:46.852 --> 10:49.935
Are you seeing this?

10:49.970 --> 10:52.430
Kindergarten playground in there.

10:52.465 --> 10:55.930
Captain, captain,
it's not me, is it?

10:55.965 --> 10:59.645
Am I? Just tell me,
am I... am I that guy?

10:59.680 --> 11:01.488
Am I... am I that far gone?

11:01.523 --> 11:04.494
Relax, Monk,
you are completely different.

11:04.529 --> 11:07.174
You put the chocolate doughnuts
in the middle, which makes perfect sense,

11:07.209 --> 11:09.428
because that way the different
groups are together.

11:09.463 --> 11:10.923
Exactly!
That's all I'm saying.

11:10.958 --> 11:14.445
And he put the chocolate donuts on
either end, which j-just isn't as good,

11:14.480 --> 11:17.305
because that way,
they're... they're separated.

11:17.340 --> 11:19.101
- Hello!
- No comparison.

11:19.136 --> 11:21.799
I told you.
He will... he will drive you crazy.

11:21.834 --> 11:24.390
- So, is he the guy?
- Uh, no.

11:24.425 --> 11:26.601
I wish he was,
but he's not the guy.

11:26.636 --> 11:30.805
He never would have misspelled
Natalie's name on the note.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.035
How do you know?

11:33.070 --> 11:37.970
Because...
Because I wouldn't have.

11:40.523 --> 11:43.310
Let's do the polygraph test anyway,
to be sure.

11:43.345 --> 11:45.348
Right.

11:45.383 --> 11:48.628
Well, what's he doing now?

11:48.663 --> 11:50.747
What's this?

11:50.782 --> 11:53.412
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.222
Not vertically.
Not vertically!

11:55.257 --> 11:57.238
Be right back.

12:14.195 --> 12:16.250
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

12:16.285 --> 12:17.960
Let's get something to eat.

12:17.995 --> 12:19.504
What about them?

12:19.539 --> 12:22.831
- They'll be fine.
- Yup.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.360
Ow!

12:48.391 --> 12:51.686
I'm... I'm glad you're quitting.

12:51.721 --> 12:53.711
Really, it's just...
just a stupid election.

12:53.746 --> 12:58.375
I mean, it's not worth
getting killed over. Right?

12:58.410 --> 13:03.518
Besides, you can run again
in another four years.

13:03.553 --> 13:07.852
Right? Mom?

13:24.439 --> 13:26.328
What are you guys doin'?

13:26.363 --> 13:28.510
Well, we're packin' everything up.

13:28.545 --> 13:31.597
Put it back.
Come on. Let's get to work.

13:31.632 --> 13:34.691
We have an election to win.

13:42.445 --> 13:44.725
I'm Natalie,
please vote for me.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.826
Hi, I'm Natalie Teeger.
I'm running for school board.

13:46.861 --> 13:48.778
- Miss Teeger?
- Hi, my name's Natalie Teeger.

13:48.813 --> 13:50.680
Hey, Miss Teeger?
What are you doing?

13:50.715 --> 13:53.281
I'm running for office.
Hi, Natalie Teeger. Thank you.

13:53.316 --> 13:55.187
I thought you had dropped out of the race.

13:55.222 --> 13:56.184
Changed my mind.

13:56.219 --> 13:58.094
- Why?
- I have my reasons.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.221
Hi,

14:00.256 --> 14:02.990
uh, are you registered to vote?

14:03.025 --> 14:05.533
Who are you gonna vote for?
It's time to wear a pin.

14:05.568 --> 14:09.039
Mr. Ellis?
You're scaring him.

14:09.074 --> 14:10.860
- Okay.
- He's scaring me.

14:10.895 --> 14:13.453
Vote Teeger!
Hi, vote for Natalie Teeger.

14:13.488 --> 14:16.342
Vote Teeger!
Hi, vote for Natalie Teeger.

14:16.377 --> 14:17.777
Where did you find them?

14:17.812 --> 14:19.383
They heard about the shooting
and wanted to help.

14:19.418 --> 14:20.824
I can't protect you out here.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.206
There are too many rooftops,
too many windows.

14:23.241 --> 14:25.206
That's a risk I'm willing to take.
Thank you.

14:25.241 --> 14:26.550
You have to think about Julie.

14:26.585 --> 14:28.336
I am thinking about Julie,
Mr. Monk.

14:28.371 --> 14:30.209
More than you know.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.737
She won't listen to me.

14:31.772 --> 14:33.096
Did you talk to Harold Krenshaw?

14:33.131 --> 14:35.280
We don't think Mr. Krenshaw is involved.

14:35.315 --> 14:37.347
His alibi is airtight,
and he just passed a polygraph.

14:37.382 --> 14:39.396
We're working with ATF
to track down the weapon.

14:39.431 --> 14:43.533
In the meantime, Miss Teeger, I need
for you to cancel all public appearances.

14:43.568 --> 14:46.681
I can't do that.

14:46.716 --> 14:48.330
Okay.

14:48.365 --> 14:52.173
We need to sweep the campaign office
for explosives every morning. - Yes, sir.

14:52.208 --> 14:55.085
I want a lockdown.
Two uniforms, round the clock.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.237
Even when she's not there.

14:56.272 --> 14:57.680
Yes, sir.

14:57.715 --> 15:00.560
And I am assigning you a bodyguard.

15:00.595 --> 15:04.667
Lieutenant, thank you for volunteering.

15:04.702 --> 15:08.396
- He's my bodyguard?
- 24-7.

15:08.431 --> 15:11.305
I'm still not droppin' out.

15:14.490 --> 15:15.916
That's not my job.

15:15.951 --> 15:18.210
It is now.

15:21.269 --> 15:22.512
All clear.

15:22.547 --> 15:25.219
- Is Julie here today?
- No. She's staying with my parents

15:25.254 --> 15:26.953
until you guys figure out what's
the hell is going on.

15:26.988 --> 15:31.161
Okay, Natalie, if this school closes, who
would benefit? Would they sell the building?

15:31.196 --> 15:34.867
No. The city would keep it and
use it for special education classes.

15:34.902 --> 15:36.538
That doesn't make any sense.

15:36.573 --> 15:38.236
I mean, there...
there is no motive.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.347
I... I know.

15:39.382 --> 15:42.402
There are 14 other members on the board.
Most of them agree with me.

15:42.437 --> 15:45.786
What, is this maniac going to kill off
the whole school board?

15:45.821 --> 15:47.267
Oh.

15:48.529 --> 15:50.617
- Yo!
- Miss Teeger!

15:50.652 --> 15:52.222
Please, don't do that.

15:52.257 --> 15:54.304
- What?
- Walk away without telling me.

15:54.339 --> 15:57.078
- I went 5 feet.
- Still. It's protocol.

15:57.113 --> 15:59.137
Ow!

16:03.284 --> 16:06.146
I don't think this was
about the school at all.

16:06.181 --> 16:11.094
I can't stop thinking about that note
and how he misspelled your name.

16:11.129 --> 16:13.122
What do you think it means?

16:13.157 --> 16:15.449
I don't know.

16:15.484 --> 16:20.467
- But it's important.
- Hmm.

16:20.502 --> 16:23.256
Hmm, brings back memories, huh?

16:23.291 --> 16:25.498
Yeah.

16:25.533 --> 16:27.659
But what are you gonna do?

16:27.694 --> 16:30.273
I used to love tetherball.

16:30.308 --> 16:32.187
It wasn't really my game.

16:32.222 --> 16:36.011
- What was your game, Mr. Monk?
- Give it, give it!

16:36.046 --> 16:37.971
Keep-away.

16:38.006 --> 16:40.183
I played a lot of keep-away.

16:40.218 --> 16:42.357
Keep-away?

16:42.392 --> 16:45.602
I was usually the jumper.
That was my position.

16:47.642 --> 16:50.033
- It was good exercise, too.
- Hey, jump for it, squirt.

16:50.068 --> 16:52.921
The ball was movin' around...
Cardiovascular.

16:52.956 --> 16:55.630
Jump. Now, now! Jump!

16:55.665 --> 16:58.223
Oh, this kid's timing is way off.

16:58.258 --> 17:01.467
- It's all about timing.
- Crybaby.

17:01.502 --> 17:04.827
Now, now he's crying?

17:04.862 --> 17:09.297
I usually started crying a lot earlier.
But everybody's got a different style.

17:09.332 --> 17:10.791
You played this a lot?

17:10.827 --> 17:14.458
All through high school.
Some college.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.296
Got pretty good at it.

17:16.330 --> 17:18.723
The secret to keep-away is

17:18.758 --> 17:21.924
you have to have a lot
of other hats at home,

17:21.959 --> 17:25.924
and not get too attached to any of them.

17:29.188 --> 17:31.180
It was a good match.

17:31.215 --> 17:32.944
Oh, honey, I can't.
Not tonight.

17:32.979 --> 17:36.301
I have a big debate tomorrow.
I have to go home and practice.

17:36.336 --> 17:39.312
I know, I miss you too.
I love you, angel.

17:39.347 --> 17:41.757
You be good for Grandma and Grandpa, okay?

17:41.792 --> 17:44.342
All right, bye.

17:49.661 --> 17:53.619
Mr. Monk? Please.
A little help?

17:58.893 --> 18:03.374
Hi, hello. Can I help?

18:03.409 --> 18:05.514
Of course, you can.

18:05.549 --> 18:09.081
The more the merrier.

18:09.116 --> 18:12.323
Here you go.
You take a flyer,

18:12.358 --> 18:16.414
you fold it up,
in the envelope,

18:16.449 --> 18:18.638
and seal it.

18:21.619 --> 18:24.332
Here you go.

19:15.268 --> 19:18.162
- There's five.
- All right.

19:18.197 --> 19:21.343
Hey, hey, Karen.
Hey, Donna. Hey, Lee-John.

19:21.378 --> 19:24.769
Who's hungry?
I have homemade lasagna.

19:24.804 --> 19:27.332
A little fuel to keep us going.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.491
Mr. Monk, are you hungry?
An army marches on its stomach.

19:30.526 --> 19:32.385
Oh, no. No, thank you.

19:32.420 --> 19:37.201
Herr General, eat. Keep your strength up.
You've got a big debate tomorrow.

19:37.236 --> 19:42.895
Excuse me.
I think I'd better try this.

19:50.818 --> 19:53.132
A little too much oregano,
but it's not poison.

19:53.167 --> 19:56.185
That's what every cook likes to hear.

19:57.774 --> 20:00.764
Ahem, listen, Natalie, do you want me
to get this copier out of here?

20:00.799 --> 20:04.418
I could take it to the junkyard for you.
I got a buddy with a truck.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.101
Thank you, Jack,

20:06.136 --> 20:08.654
but I got the repair guy comin' back
tomorrow to check it out.

20:08.689 --> 20:11.076
Besides, it makes a
hell of a buffet, right?

20:11.111 --> 20:13.559
Miss Teeger,
you have a phone call.

20:27.099 --> 20:29.196
- No, don't put me on hold.
- Natalie,

20:29.231 --> 20:31.954
do you still have the poster Julie made?
The one that was above the door?

20:31.989 --> 20:35.429
Yeah, I think it's behind those boxes.

20:42.882 --> 20:46.139
It was missing an "R."
I found it over there.

20:46.174 --> 20:49.899
Oh, It must've fallen off
when she was putting it up.

20:56.467 --> 21:01.659
The sniper didn't know her name.

21:01.694 --> 21:05.350
That's why he misspelled it.

21:05.385 --> 21:10.223
So, all he knew
was what he saw on this poster.

21:10.258 --> 21:11.923
What does it mean?

21:11.958 --> 21:16.864
Well, it means,
the note he left was just a diversion.

21:19.234 --> 21:23.380
This wasn't about you at all.

21:28.474 --> 21:33.850
All right, this will be the podium. Uh,
Lieutenant, do you have the questions?

21:33.885 --> 21:36.675
- Yeah.
- All right, let's get started.

21:36.710 --> 21:40.114
Mr. Monk, you will be the moderator.
If you'll come right over here.

21:40.149 --> 21:43.582
He had to be shooting at somebody.
So why was he trying to scare you?

21:43.617 --> 21:44.642
You said it was a diversion.

21:44.677 --> 21:47.839
But diversion from what?
It doesn't make any sense.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.770
No, I can't worry about that.
I have a debate tomorrow.

21:49.805 --> 21:51.298
I have to practice.

21:51.333 --> 21:54.246
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

21:54.281 --> 21:58.741
- Okay.
- Hello, welcome to the debate.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.086
I'll be your moderator.

22:00.121 --> 22:03.026
Who has the first question?
Lieutenant.

22:03.061 --> 22:05.043
Miss Teeger,

22:05.078 --> 22:08.006
"Why should the entire community pay
to keep Ashton Junior High open?"

22:08.041 --> 22:09.906
Miss Teeger,
you have 30 seconds.

22:09.941 --> 22:11.103
That's a very good question.

22:11.138 --> 22:14.777
It's true that closing Ashton Junior High
would save the taxpayers money.

22:14.812 --> 22:16.425
But it would cost $1.20...

22:16.460 --> 22:17.860
- What are you doing?
- ...22.

22:17.895 --> 22:19.920
I don't have a stopwatch. 20

22:19.955 --> 22:21.639
- 19...
- Mr. Monk, I can't concentrate.

22:21.674 --> 22:26.145
...17,16

22:26.180 --> 22:29.001
14, 13, 12... - ...which would
more than offset... Please stop.

22:29.036 --> 22:32.110
Just stop counting!

22:32.145 --> 22:33.990
Thank you.

22:34.025 --> 22:35.667
Could you repeat the question?

22:35.702 --> 22:38.252
- Miss Teeger...
- Time's up.

22:38.287 --> 22:40.178
Come on!

22:42.384 --> 22:43.922
Miss Teeger,
are you all right?

22:43.957 --> 22:45.925
I'm fine.

22:47.684 --> 22:50.431
It's a grenade.
Get rid of it!

24:38.058 --> 24:41.297
- You all right?
- Yeah.

24:41.332 --> 24:43.240
Disher told me

24:43.275 --> 24:46.670
that you put the grenade
in the refrigerator. - Yeah.

24:46.705 --> 24:50.568
And then he said you went back
and opened it again.

24:51.696 --> 24:55.673
You just had to straighten
something out, didn't you?

24:55.708 --> 24:59.671
I'm gonna ask the Mayor to give
you a medal for what you did.

24:59.706 --> 25:02.527
And then I'm gonna ask the Mayor
to take that medal back.

25:02.562 --> 25:06.439
Because you just had to open
that door, didn't you?

25:06.474 --> 25:09.856
- So it's a wash?
- Yeah, it's a wash.

25:09.891 --> 25:14.121
Captain, that grenade
had Russian markings.

25:14.156 --> 25:16.423
I know.
We found a piece of it.

25:16.458 --> 25:18.266
It was made in Chechnya.

25:18.301 --> 25:20.633
This guy must be very well connected.

25:20.668 --> 25:25.221
Whoever he is,
you must be making him nervous.

25:25.256 --> 25:27.755
- How's Natalie?
- She's fine.

25:27.790 --> 25:29.697
But you got to talk to her, Monk.

25:29.732 --> 25:34.071
She still won't quit.
Even after this.

25:40.002 --> 25:42.333
Natalie, it's me.

25:43.233 --> 25:45.319
Come in.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.507
I'm not quitting.

25:49.542 --> 25:52.026
Natalie, look.
We... We... We don't know

25:52.061 --> 25:53.992
who this guy is.
We don't know what's going on.

25:54.027 --> 25:55.891
Then figure it out,
Mr. Brilliant Detective,

25:55.926 --> 25:58.221
figure it out,
because I'm not quitting.

25:58.256 --> 26:02.366
- I can't quit.
- Of course you can!

26:09.396 --> 26:12.001
I see.

26:12.036 --> 26:18.340
You can't quit
because Mitch was a hero.

26:19.611 --> 26:22.735
You don't understand.

26:22.770 --> 26:27.566
I can't quit because Mitch wasn't a hero.

26:30.933 --> 26:34.096
Close the door.

26:35.691 --> 26:39.265
What I'm about to tell you dies with you.

26:39.300 --> 26:42.335
Do you understand?

26:44.979 --> 26:48.222
Okay.

26:55.049 --> 27:01.362
My husband and two crewmembers
were shot down over Kosovo in 1998.

27:01.397 --> 27:05.705
They crash-landed behind enemy lines.

27:05.740 --> 27:08.048
Mitch didn't make it out.

27:11.907 --> 27:15.112
But they rescued the other crewmembers.

27:15.147 --> 27:19.628
And when they got back,
they said...

27:19.663 --> 27:22.469
They said he panicked.

27:22.504 --> 27:26.529
They said that after the crash,

27:26.564 --> 27:33.043
he ran off with the radio
and all their supplies.

27:33.078 --> 27:37.031
- They said he was a coward.
- Oh, my God.

27:37.066 --> 27:41.037
And the Navy can't prove
their version of the story,

27:41.072 --> 27:43.526
but it's in the record.

27:43.561 --> 27:46.650
It's in a file somewhere.

27:46.685 --> 27:50.918
- Natalie.
- I don't know what the real story is.

27:50.953 --> 27:53.952
But all I know

27:53.987 --> 28:00.008
is some day, Julie is going to start
asking questions about her father.

28:00.043 --> 28:02.610
He's not here.

28:02.645 --> 28:05.264
But I'm here.

28:05.299 --> 28:08.050
I'm all she has.

28:08.085 --> 28:10.928
I can't be a coward, too.

28:21.679 --> 28:22.939
Hello.

28:22.974 --> 28:25.713
Welcome to the fifth District
School Board debate.

28:25.748 --> 28:30.245
We're all aware of the controversy
and tragedy surrounding this election.

28:30.280 --> 28:35.139
But tonight we're going to try to rise
above all that and focus on the issues.

28:35.174 --> 28:39.282
I'm going to ask our two candidates
to make a brief opening statement.

28:39.317 --> 28:42.886
Natalie,
why don't you go first?

28:42.921 --> 28:45.276
Uh...
Good evening.

28:45.311 --> 28:49.818
I'm Natalie Teeger, and I'm running
for school board for one reason.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.999
To save my daughter's school.

28:52.034 --> 28:55.204
As a mother, I know you can't put
a price on a good education.

28:55.239 --> 28:58.459
- And if we don't invest in our children...
- Jack. - What are you doin'?

28:58.494 --> 29:01.020
- ...not only their future...
- Oh, well, I...

29:01.055 --> 29:02.541
I have a question.

29:02.576 --> 29:04.624
- Cool. Give 'em hell, man!
- Yeah.

29:04.659 --> 29:06.921
Hey, check this out.
I designed a new flyer for the campaign.

29:06.956 --> 29:08.524
We can hang them up
tomorrow near the polls.

29:08.559 --> 29:11.232
- Okay, great, thanks.
- ...I will work with all of you

29:11.267 --> 29:14.047
to make this school,
and the entire system,

29:14.082 --> 29:17.929
work even better.
Thank you.

29:19.465 --> 29:23.667
Next, we'll hear from her opponent,
Mr. Harold Krenshaw.

29:23.702 --> 29:28.170
Hello. I'm Harold Krenshaw.

29:28.205 --> 29:30.116
You all know me.

29:30.151 --> 29:33.614
You know where I stand.

29:33.649 --> 29:36.440
Reduce the budget, lower taxes.

29:36.475 --> 29:39.240
If that means consolidating
a few of our schools,

29:39.275 --> 29:42.960
then that's what we have to do.

29:42.995 --> 29:45.723
Yeah.

29:48.014 --> 29:51.721
Okay. Who has the first question?

29:51.756 --> 29:53.529
Please state your name.

29:53.564 --> 29:55.513
My name is Adrian Monk.

29:55.548 --> 29:58.703
Uh, my question is for Mr. Krenshaw.

29:58.738 --> 30:03.390
Mr. Krenshaw, during this campaign,
you have made a number of statements.

30:03.425 --> 30:05.962
I wonder if you might
be able to substantiate

30:05.997 --> 30:08.929
one of those statements for us right now.

30:08.964 --> 30:13.505
You said that you have been
to Dr. Kroger's house.

30:13.540 --> 30:15.729
- Oh, God.
- That's right.

30:15.764 --> 30:21.846
In fact, I believe you said that you had
Christmas dinner with him last year.

30:21.881 --> 30:26.212
- Yeah.
- But Dr. Kroger is Jewish.

30:26.247 --> 30:32.454
He doesn't celebrate Christmas,
does he, Mr. Krenshaw?

30:32.489 --> 30:35.826
His first wife, Alisha, was Jewish.

30:35.861 --> 30:39.371
But Madeline, his fiancee,
is Irish Catholic.

30:39.406 --> 30:42.946
They celebrate both.

30:48.132 --> 30:49.996
His fiancee?

30:50.031 --> 30:53.261
Yeah. I introduced them.

30:53.296 --> 30:55.169
That is a lie.

30:55.204 --> 30:58.764
Dr. Kroger never said
anything to me about a fiancee.

30:58.799 --> 31:00.733
Let me repeat that for you.

31:00.768 --> 31:04.985
Dr. Kroger never said anything to me
about a fiancee.

31:05.020 --> 31:06.310
Go to hell, Monk.

31:06.345 --> 31:09.742
- You... You can go to hell.
- You go to hell! You! You!

31:09.777 --> 31:12.299
Okay. Thank you.

31:12.334 --> 31:16.810
Natalie, you have 30 seconds for rebuttal.

31:16.845 --> 31:20.326
Uh, I... I don't know
where Dr. Kroger is this evening,

31:20.361 --> 31:23.982
but our prayers are with him.

31:40.234 --> 31:41.939
- Monk, what's goin' on?
- Did you see that?

31:41.974 --> 31:44.107
- See what?
- That guy. Whitman.

31:44.142 --> 31:48.512
He got to the door,
then he stopped.

31:48.547 --> 31:50.129
He's done time.

31:50.164 --> 31:52.233
In prison, you never open your own door.

31:52.268 --> 31:55.652
They open them for you,
and after a while, it becomes a habit.

31:55.687 --> 31:58.413
- He must have just been released.
- Okay, so, he's done time.

31:58.448 --> 32:01.880
Look. He just handed me this.
Look how it's folded.

32:01.915 --> 32:05.223
Four corners to the center,
then in half, and half again.

32:05.258 --> 32:08.554
In my whole life, I've only ever seen
one piece of paper folded like this.

32:08.589 --> 32:10.296
The sniper's note.

32:10.331 --> 32:11.935
He's the guy.

32:11.970 --> 32:15.491
Why? What's he after?

32:15.526 --> 32:17.356
I don't know.

32:17.391 --> 32:19.236
But he's the guy.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.808
Oh, yeah.

32:31.374 --> 32:33.624
Don't you ever get tired of being right?

32:33.659 --> 32:35.616
I do feel tired.

32:35.651 --> 32:39.432
More fatigued, really.
I don't know if it's from being right...

32:39.467 --> 32:43.001
It was a rhetorical question, Monk.

32:43.036 --> 32:45.276
You could be on to something here.

32:45.311 --> 32:47.865
Jack Whitman.
He's been sent up twice.

32:47.900 --> 32:50.890
First time for mail fraud
and receiving stolen property.

32:50.925 --> 32:53.545
Lately, he's been importing rugs.

32:53.580 --> 32:54.548
Rugs?

32:54.583 --> 32:58.931
Yeah, rugs, from places like Chechnya,
Uzbekistan. Sound familiar?

32:58.966 --> 33:00.530
The shell casing and the grenade.

33:00.565 --> 33:04.002
The Feds think that
he's a major arms dealer.

33:04.037 --> 33:06.653
They raided his office six months ago.
They came up empty-handed.

33:06.688 --> 33:08.907
No guns, no nothing, no paper trail.

33:08.942 --> 33:11.153
All they could get him on was tax evasion.

33:11.188 --> 33:14.404
He did five months.
He just got out last Wednesday.

33:14.439 --> 33:17.696
And two days later,
he's on a roof taking shots at Natalie.

33:17.731 --> 33:22.735
Then he joins her campaign,
and then he tries to take you out.

33:22.770 --> 33:24.698
What's he after?

33:24.733 --> 33:26.398
I'm not going to wait to find out.

33:26.433 --> 33:28.641
- Let's go get him.
- Oh, I can't go.

33:28.676 --> 33:29.957
You're on your own.

33:29.992 --> 33:32.345
Natalie's waiting for me downstairs.
I have to go vote.

33:32.380 --> 33:34.445
Well, that's good.
You're doing your civic duty.

33:34.480 --> 33:38.810
There's that.
Also, if I don't vote, Natalie will...

33:38.845 --> 33:41.426
You know.

33:41.461 --> 33:43.697
Oh.

33:56.502 --> 33:57.830
Here you go.

33:57.865 --> 34:00.097
- You guys voting today?
- No.

34:00.132 --> 34:02.909
There's a polling place right around
the corner. So, you have no excuses.

34:02.944 --> 34:06.257
Sure we do: We don't care.

34:14.251 --> 34:16.666
Wow, that was weird.

34:16.701 --> 34:18.420
I've never voted for myself before.
That was...

34:18.456 --> 34:19.958
That was really weird.

34:19.993 --> 34:21.915
But not bad-weird,
good-weird.

34:21.949 --> 34:24.395
Actually, that was kind of great-weird.
All right, let's go.

34:24.429 --> 34:26.906
Uh, I haven't voted yet.

34:26.940 --> 34:30.300
- What have you been doing?
- I'm still signing in.

34:30.335 --> 34:33.429
I'm almost done.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.570
Booth number two.

34:45.085 --> 34:48.574
- What?
- It's small, huh?

34:48.609 --> 34:50.130
Yeah.
I know it is.

34:50.165 --> 34:53.666
I really appreciate this, Mr. Monk.

34:56.752 --> 34:59.363
I can't do it.
I just can't.

34:59.398 --> 35:01.043
Mr. Monk, come on.

35:01.078 --> 35:03.575
You know what this election means to me.

35:03.610 --> 35:06.593
Now, you can do this.
Here we go. Here we go.

35:06.628 --> 35:08.841
Democracy in action.

35:08.876 --> 35:11.604
Okay.

35:11.639 --> 35:13.742
I got it.

35:13.777 --> 35:16.245
Oh.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.359
Shh.

35:21.758 --> 35:23.505
Hello?

35:23.540 --> 35:26.047
No, sir, he can't.
He's voting.

35:27.047 --> 35:28.500
All right, bye.

35:33.129 --> 35:36.149
Ah, I can't...
I can't breathe in here.

35:36.184 --> 35:37.704
There's no...
There's no air in here.

35:37.739 --> 35:38.943
No, there's air.
You can breathe.

35:38.978 --> 35:43.008
- Lots of air.
- Oh.

35:43.043 --> 35:46.497
- How did it go?
- I'm not... not...not quite finished.

35:46.532 --> 35:49.799
Just... just gonna take
a little bit of a break.

35:51.273 --> 35:53.942
So many choices, huh?

35:53.977 --> 35:56.327
Column two. Teeger.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.237
Third name down: Teeger.

35:58.272 --> 36:01.000
Okay, all right,
I'm... I'm going, now.

36:01.035 --> 36:04.570
No wonder turnout is so low.

36:19.078 --> 36:21.812
Natalie, where did you get that box?

36:21.847 --> 36:24.865
I don't know.
The... The campaign office.

36:27.006 --> 36:29.817
That was Jack Whitman's box, remember?

36:29.852 --> 36:33.459
He brought it with food in it from home.

36:33.494 --> 36:38.062
Oh, my God,
I know what Jack Whitman was after.

36:38.097 --> 36:40.038
Have you heard if he's in custody yet?

36:40.073 --> 36:42.146
The Captain just called.
They said they can't find him.

36:42.181 --> 36:43.587
Well, I know where he is going.

36:43.622 --> 36:45.024
We got to call the Captain back,

36:45.059 --> 36:47.244
and tell him to meet us
at the campaign headquarters.

36:47.279 --> 36:50.089
- What's going on?
- Tazarr copier. Sound familiar?

36:50.124 --> 36:53.676
The copy machine at your campaign office
used to belong to Jack Whitman.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.207
That's what this whole thing
has been about.

36:56.242 --> 36:58.522
The copy machine?

36:58.557 --> 37:00.386
Sir!
Sir, we need my car.

37:00.421 --> 37:02.547
We're in a hurry!
It's right there!

37:02.582 --> 37:04.048
Here you go!
Here you go!

37:04.083 --> 37:06.088
$10.

37:06.123 --> 37:08.074
I don't have any cash.
I was going to stop at the ATM.

37:08.109 --> 37:10.128
Do you have any money?

37:10.163 --> 37:12.093
Do you ever have any money?

37:12.128 --> 37:16.832
Listen, this is very important.
It's a police emergency, I need my car.

37:16.867 --> 37:18.683
Here, take my purse as collateral.

37:18.718 --> 37:22.310
- I can't do that.
- Oh, come on!

37:24.001 --> 37:27.035
- Hey! You can't do that!
- It's an emergency.

37:27.070 --> 37:29.631
- Shawn! Shawn!
- Oh, come on, give me the keys!

37:29.666 --> 37:32.154
You got to be kidding me.

37:32.189 --> 37:37.201
- Key. Whoa.
- Whoa.

37:37.236 --> 37:39.222
It's keep-away.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.766
Natalie! Natalie, stop!

37:42.801 --> 37:44.609
You... You're just embarrassing yourself.

37:44.644 --> 37:49.254
No offense, okay,
but I'm comin' in.

37:49.289 --> 37:51.729
Come on, get out of there.

37:55.370 --> 37:57.199
Bring it.

37:57.234 --> 37:58.677
Mr. Monk, come on,
let's just walk.

37:58.712 --> 38:02.161
No. There's not enough time.

38:02.196 --> 38:05.563
Whitman is already on his way
to your campaign office

38:05.598 --> 38:09.243
because the cops that were stationed
there have all been sent home.

38:09.278 --> 38:11.987
That's why Whitman was waitin' around.

38:12.022 --> 38:13.091
Here's what happened.

38:13.126 --> 38:15.822
Six months ago, Whitman was in
his office, minding his own business,

38:15.857 --> 38:20.394
which, in his case, was buying
and selling illegal weapons.

38:22.244 --> 38:23.387
ATF! Open up!

38:23.422 --> 38:25.048
The ATF raided the office.

38:25.083 --> 38:28.363
Whitman managed to burn all
the incriminating papers he had,

38:28.398 --> 38:31.117
- except for one.
- The one in the copy machine!

38:31.152 --> 38:34.219
Exactly. There was something
jammed inside that machine.

38:34.254 --> 38:36.587
A document, a receipt.
Whatever it was,

38:36.622 --> 38:38.541
it must be pretty important.

38:38.576 --> 38:42.614
After he was arrested, The Feds
confiscated all of his equipment,

38:42.649 --> 38:45.842
including the copy machine.

38:45.877 --> 38:48.422
Last week,
when he got out of jail,

38:48.457 --> 38:52.172
he learned that the copier
had been sold at the police auction.

38:52.207 --> 38:54.775
What the hell is he talkin' about?

38:54.810 --> 38:56.026
Who cares?

38:57.059 --> 38:58.646
The auction was open to the public,

38:58.681 --> 39:01.220
so it wasn't hard for Whitman
to track you down.

39:01.255 --> 39:05.702
He knew the document inside that copier
could send him to jail for life.

39:05.737 --> 39:10.396
Somehow, Whitman had to stop
the repairman from opening it up.

39:10.431 --> 39:13.153
He grabbed one of his guns,
ran up to the roof across the street,

39:13.188 --> 39:15.157
and tried to take out the copier.

39:15.192 --> 39:18.317
He figured if he shot it to hell,
you'd just throw it out.

39:18.352 --> 39:21.123
But you never did.
That's why he volunteered.

39:21.158 --> 39:23.425
He was waiting for
a chance to break into it.

39:23.460 --> 39:26.734
But the cops were there around the clock.

39:26.769 --> 39:28.323
Oh, shoot, almost had it.

39:28.358 --> 39:31.907
And when I got suspicious,
he tried to kill me with that grenade.

39:31.942 --> 39:33.307
Damn!

39:33.917 --> 39:35.217
Ah!

39:36.334 --> 39:38.825
Okay, I give up.

39:40.654 --> 39:42.345
Damn, you are good!

39:42.380 --> 39:44.034
Let's go!

39:48.072 --> 39:50.541
I'll be back with your money!

39:58.613 --> 40:03.037
- Whitman, touch that gun and you're dead!
- Hands on your head! Hands on your head!

40:09.073 --> 40:12.148
Captain.
Captain, what is it?

40:12.183 --> 40:16.365
Looks like a client list.
It's a half a dozen names.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.950
Delivery dates.
Stinger missiles.

40:19.985 --> 40:23.194
Rocket-propelled grenades.
This is big.

40:23.229 --> 40:26.028
I've got a friend at the Bureau
who's been looking for this.

40:26.063 --> 40:28.191
Let's go.

40:30.393 --> 40:34.843
- When did you put this together?
- In the voting booth.

40:37.391 --> 40:39.162
Thank you again for doing that, Mr. Monk.

40:39.197 --> 40:40.900
Every vote counts.

40:41.783 --> 40:45.497
You did vote for me, didn't you?

40:45.532 --> 40:51.287
I think so. I don't know, it's all,
you know, kind of a blur, really.

40:51.322 --> 40:54.635
What if I lose by one vote?

40:59.380 --> 41:01.675
You didn't quit.

41:01.710 --> 41:04.627
And for the record,
it wasn't me. I mean,

41:04.662 --> 41:07.202
you didn't lose by just one vote.

41:07.237 --> 41:09.060
Yeah, I know.

41:09.095 --> 41:13.427
You lost by a lot more than one vote.

41:13.462 --> 41:18.021
- It was close to a landslide.
- Yes, I know. Thank you, Mr. Monk.

41:18.056 --> 41:20.060
Are you, okay?

41:20.095 --> 41:23.469
Yeah, I feel pretty great.

41:23.504 --> 41:25.302
We're fighters, right?

41:25.337 --> 41:27.921
- We'll be back, right?
- Right.

41:27.956 --> 41:30.307
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, hey, everyone.

41:30.342 --> 41:33.756
It's... It's Harold's victory speech.

41:33.791 --> 41:35.032
Boo!

41:35.067 --> 41:38.117
There are so many people that
I... I want to thank.

41:38.152 --> 41:43.894
My secret weapon,
my beautiful wife, Clarissa.

41:43.929 --> 41:46.685
I love you, honey.
Thank you.

41:46.720 --> 41:52.390
But most of all, I want to thank
my good friend and my therapist,

41:52.425 --> 41:54.675
Dr. Charles Kroger.

41:54.710 --> 41:56.346
Chuck, come on.

41:56.381 --> 41:57.528
- Chuck?
- No, come on, come on.

41:57.563 --> 42:02.128
Thank you.
God bless you.

42:02.163 --> 42:05.443
You okay?

42:05.478 --> 42:07.496
Uh, I'd like to go home now.

42:07.531 --> 42:10.672
All right, all right,
let me just get my purse.

42:10.707 --> 42:14.009
Come on, Mr. Monk. This way.

42:14.044 --> 42:16.361
It's okay, it's okay. I got you.

42:16.396 --> 42:19.693
Did you hear that?
He called him "Chuck."
