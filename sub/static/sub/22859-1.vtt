01:56.369 --> 01:58.662
﻿Just a couple more things...

02:01.875 --> 02:03.459
﻿Then well go home.

02:05.128 --> 02:06.420
﻿What are you doing?

02:09.007 --> 02:10.883
﻿Kids, behave!

02:16.848 --> 02:18.891
﻿Third time shopping this week?

02:19.976 --> 02:21.977
﻿I’ve got eight kids, praise God.

02:28.777 --> 02:31.445
﻿Sweetie, we're going home soon.

02:34.658 --> 02:36.951
﻿We should look at the good things.

02:37.077 --> 02:40.412
﻿Shabbat is coming soon.

02:41.164 --> 02:43.123
﻿I shouldn't complain,

02:43.250 --> 02:46.669
﻿but surely you understand my troubles?

02:51.466 --> 02:53.884
﻿Let me get you a fresh one.

02:54.010 --> 02:55.219
﻿It looks fine.

03:04.688 --> 03:07.481
﻿Why are we selling
﻿this unwashed lettuce?

03:08.608 --> 03:11.026
﻿You're such an extremist.

03:11.152 --> 03:13.237
﻿It's not worth it.

03:13.989 --> 03:18.075
﻿We earn no profit
﻿on the pre-washed stuff.

03:19.285 --> 03:21.286
﻿This has no rabbinical approval,
﻿it could have worms.

03:21.413 --> 03:22.522
﻿Are you kidding me?

03:22.622 --> 03:24.415
﻿You’re late for work.

03:24.916 --> 03:26.750
﻿You forget to mop the floors.

03:27.293 --> 03:29.378
﻿The customers complain.

03:30.046 --> 03:31.213
﻿Now it's the lettuce?

03:31.673 --> 03:33.632
﻿People can wash it on their own.

03:34.384 --> 03:36.077
﻿…but the Ruv insists.

03:36.177 --> 03:37.386
﻿Start acting like a mensch,

03:37.887 --> 03:39.304
﻿then you can tell me about the Ruv.

03:39.681 --> 03:41.348
﻿For now, don’t bother
﻿me about the Ruv.

04:34.569 --> 04:36.820
﻿These rabbis who outlaw eruvin.

04:37.614 --> 04:39.740
﻿They’re meddling with our traditions.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.409
﻿He doesn’t allow women to wear wigs.

04:42.786 --> 04:44.787
﻿Exactly. Don't change our traditions.

04:45.705 --> 04:47.915
﻿You know what I say?

04:48.750 --> 04:50.610
﻿I’m not talking about Jewish Law,

04:50.710 --> 04:53.379
﻿but carrying on Shabbat doesn’t smell good.

04:56.216 --> 04:57.716
﻿I’m serious.

05:00.678 --> 05:03.722
﻿Landau, who stopped being observant...

05:04.182 --> 05:05.974
﻿They threw his kids out of school.

05:06.434 --> 05:09.478
﻿Yankel might be a heretic,
﻿but why punish his kids?

05:10.939 --> 05:13.899
﻿Maybe this brings him back into the fold.

05:15.944 --> 05:18.195
﻿But his wife is still religious.

05:18.321 --> 05:21.115
﻿We can't have these kids in our schools.

05:21.282 --> 05:22.991
﻿But the kids are not at fault.

06:30.351 --> 06:32.436
﻿How was your meeting with the lady?

06:34.522 --> 06:35.564
﻿Praise God.

06:38.401 --> 06:41.320
﻿Chana's father said it didn't go well.

06:42.655 --> 06:43.780
﻿I’m just not ready yet.

06:44.782 --> 06:47.701
﻿"All beginnings are hard,"
﻿the Talmud says.

06:51.372 --> 06:53.566
﻿Think about your son's well-being.

06:53.666 --> 06:57.961
﻿He should be raised in a proper home.

06:58.129 --> 07:02.716
﻿Why can’t I raise Rieven on my own?

07:04.052 --> 07:05.245
﻿Why must he live at Eizik’s?

07:05.345 --> 07:07.512
﻿A stepmother won't be any better.

07:07.889 --> 07:13.977
﻿She wouldn't be permitted
﻿to touch my son.

07:14.771 --> 07:16.923
﻿You must find a new wife,

07:17.023 --> 07:19.358
﻿she will run your household,

07:19.484 --> 07:21.944
﻿she'll keep your home clean.

07:22.153 --> 07:23.763
﻿It will be a fine, pious home.

07:23.863 --> 07:25.322
﻿Then Rieven may live with you.

07:26.866 --> 07:28.116
﻿It won't be the same.

07:28.576 --> 07:30.061
﻿It will never be the same,

07:30.161 --> 07:32.454
﻿yet life must go on.

09:00.043 --> 09:01.084
﻿Dad?

09:02.378 --> 09:03.879
﻿Get in!

09:04.297 --> 09:05.839
﻿I’m late to see my tutor.

09:07.925 --> 09:09.176
﻿Just for a minute.

09:10.970 --> 09:13.096
﻿I got you a gift.

09:16.392 --> 09:17.601
﻿Just for a minute.

09:19.854 --> 09:21.563
﻿I got you a present, come inside.

09:22.482 --> 09:23.523
﻿What’s the present?

09:25.109 --> 09:27.152
﻿A chick!
﻿Like the Yom Kippur chicken.

09:33.117 --> 09:35.827
﻿Sleep my child, my chickeleh.

09:39.123 --> 09:41.124
﻿Tomorrow we'll have you

09:41.793 --> 09:43.043
﻿in the chicken...

09:43.503 --> 09:44.544
﻿soup.

09:48.383 --> 09:49.925
﻿You’ll make everyone jealous.

10:34.220 --> 10:35.262
﻿Daddy?

10:48.234 --> 10:50.026
﻿I thought you’d never find me!

10:50.236 --> 10:52.446
﻿It stinks of fish in here.

10:53.114 --> 10:55.115
﻿Like Jonah inside the whale.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.076
﻿You could get into worse things.

10:58.453 --> 11:01.747
﻿Jonah didn’t work for my manager, Shmiel.

11:02.290 --> 11:03.331
﻿Come on.

11:17.013 --> 11:18.054
﻿So what's new?

11:21.768 --> 11:25.437
﻿Why don’t my uncle and teacher like you?

11:26.814 --> 11:28.148
﻿Who’s been telling you this?

11:28.399 --> 11:29.524
﻿We all get along fine.

11:31.694 --> 11:35.030
﻿Don’t worry about what your uncle thinks.

11:36.491 --> 11:38.116
﻿Only what you think.

11:39.118 --> 11:40.144
﻿Promise?

11:40.244 --> 11:40.952
﻿Promise.

11:41.162 --> 11:44.107
﻿Why don't you wear a hat and coat
﻿like everyone else?

11:44.207 --> 11:45.415
﻿You’d look much nicer.

11:47.585 --> 11:49.461
﻿You don’t like the way I look?

11:54.884 --> 11:58.804
﻿If there’s something
﻿you don’t understand, ask me

11:59.013 --> 12:00.639
﻿not your uncle.

12:05.311 --> 12:07.896
﻿- What else is doing?
﻿- I’m getting hungry.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.608
﻿Your tutor called in a panic.

12:11.943 --> 12:13.344
﻿You think this is a free world?

12:13.444 --> 12:14.820
﻿What are you doing here?

12:15.112 --> 12:17.739
﻿You need to go straight home after school.

12:18.157 --> 12:20.075
﻿Sorry, Uncle, he surprised me.

12:21.077 --> 12:22.369
﻿I just picked him up on the way.

12:22.745 --> 12:24.246
﻿Grab your bag and let’s go.

12:25.540 --> 12:26.832
﻿I won't deal with this.

12:26.958 --> 12:29.000
﻿When we make a plan,

12:29.335 --> 12:30.377
﻿we stick to it.

12:31.170 --> 12:33.129
﻿My family is doing you a favor.

12:33.339 --> 12:34.714
﻿Don't forget that.

13:11.085 --> 13:13.253
﻿So you follow Rabbi Moshe or Rabbi Yaakov?

13:13.838 --> 13:14.880
﻿Yaakov.

13:16.090 --> 13:19.050
﻿My family’s always been close with the Ruv.

13:19.594 --> 13:21.344
﻿My uncle was his gabbai.

13:23.139 --> 13:25.082
﻿I couldn't follow the other one.

13:25.182 --> 13:28.727
﻿I can’t believe he permits women to drive.

13:29.645 --> 13:31.646
﻿It’s just not normal.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.776
﻿Must the rabbis meddle in everything?

13:43.993 --> 13:45.910
﻿So the matchmaker says you have children?

13:46.370 --> 13:48.288
﻿- One son.
﻿- Only one?

13:53.002 --> 13:54.252
﻿Ready to get married again?

13:56.756 --> 14:00.425
﻿I was told you've been widowed
﻿only four months.

14:01.385 --> 14:03.371
﻿You've been a widower for a year, right?

14:03.471 --> 14:06.389
﻿I think it’s time for both of us.

14:07.308 --> 14:10.185
﻿Besides marriage and kids,
﻿what else is there?

14:11.145 --> 14:12.187
﻿I’m in no rush.

14:13.606 --> 14:15.565
﻿Why waste my time then?

14:16.484 --> 14:19.694
﻿The Ruv’s been pressuring me to go out.

14:21.447 --> 14:23.698
﻿But I don't think you're my type.

14:25.159 --> 14:26.185
﻿Your type?

14:26.285 --> 14:28.620
﻿And you're all I’d pray for in a husband?

14:32.500 --> 14:39.089
﻿Now I know why Hasidic men are so helpless.

14:41.592 --> 14:43.718
﻿Your mothers spoil you

14:43.844 --> 14:46.930
﻿then your wives take over.

14:47.973 --> 14:51.434
﻿I offer you the opportunity
﻿for a stable life,

14:52.478 --> 14:54.145
﻿you spit in my face.

14:57.358 --> 15:01.027
﻿Did you want to get something to eat?

15:56.459 --> 15:58.001
﻿Was school any better today?

16:00.629 --> 16:02.547
﻿But there’s still too much homework.

16:07.344 --> 16:08.762
﻿How much homework?

16:10.014 --> 16:12.515
﻿I’d rather be with you at the store.

16:14.143 --> 16:15.560
﻿That's nonsense.

16:17.438 --> 16:19.647
﻿You? Work at the store?

16:19.982 --> 16:22.650
﻿—You’re young, you have no responsibilities.

16:23.360 --> 16:27.071
﻿Be grateful you’re free to study.

16:28.657 --> 16:30.033
﻿Poor you…

16:30.159 --> 16:34.537
﻿eating Aunt Henchi’s cooking every night.

16:35.498 --> 16:36.440
﻿It’s awful.

16:36.540 --> 16:38.750
﻿She only cooks kugel and chicken.

16:41.462 --> 16:45.840
﻿Let’s stop on the way
﻿and get some schnitzel.

17:06.069 --> 17:09.405
﻿You can’t be more careful?

17:10.657 --> 17:12.157
﻿Look, it’s dripping all over you.

17:12.617 --> 17:15.036
﻿It’s not a joke, don’t laugh.

17:17.498 --> 17:19.415
﻿Look at this, that's a new shirt.

17:30.386 --> 17:31.761
﻿Ruveleh, have you eaten?

17:33.514 --> 17:35.140
﻿We bought a snack on the way.

17:37.768 --> 17:38.852
﻿Smells delicious in here.

17:39.061 --> 17:40.395
﻿What are you making?

17:41.230 --> 17:42.272
﻿Kugel.

17:50.823 --> 17:51.865
﻿Hello Eizik.

17:53.617 --> 17:55.201
﻿What's going on?

17:55.619 --> 17:57.730
﻿You're half an hour late. Where were you?

17:57.830 --> 17:59.873
﻿He was hungry. I bought him a snack.

18:02.418 --> 18:05.837
﻿I wanted to talk to you about next week...

18:06.881 --> 18:08.339
﻿the memorial for Leah.

18:08.674 --> 18:09.883
﻿You’ll make it on time?

18:12.761 --> 18:15.013
﻿I’ll prepare something to say.

18:16.056 --> 18:19.475
﻿Don’t worry about that.
﻿The Ruv’s going to be here.

18:21.770 --> 18:25.064
﻿Maybe I’ll buy Rieven a new suit.

18:26.358 --> 18:30.195
﻿You still owe me money...

18:31.238 --> 18:34.365
﻿from the last time you bought him clothing.

18:34.533 --> 18:36.242
﻿Now you want to buy him a suit?

18:36.577 --> 18:38.328
﻿With whose money?

18:39.538 --> 18:40.997
﻿I’m not an outsider here!

18:41.290 --> 18:44.292
﻿I should be the one hosting the memorial!

18:44.752 --> 18:46.920
﻿Don’t yell. The family’s here.

18:48.672 --> 18:49.756
﻿Calm down.

18:53.052 --> 18:58.097
﻿You’ve never respected me,

18:58.557 --> 19:00.141
﻿even when I was married to your sister.

19:00.517 --> 19:02.727
﻿You have no respect for yourself.

19:02.853 --> 19:04.687
﻿Why should I respect you?

19:09.944 --> 19:11.527
﻿I’m taking my son.

19:11.654 --> 19:13.071
﻿I don’t need him raised in a home

19:13.989 --> 19:16.449
﻿where everything is so strict.

19:17.076 --> 19:19.577
﻿I’m his father. I know what’s best for him.

19:20.746 --> 19:22.121
﻿What do you know?

19:22.873 --> 19:23.957
﻿Enough!

19:24.124 --> 19:25.333
﻿Let’s

19:26.919 --> 19:28.920
﻿It’s my responsibility to raise Rieven!

19:29.088 --> 19:30.838
﻿I’ll be letting the Ruv know!

19:31.006 --> 19:32.131
﻿I don't care.

20:42.828 --> 20:43.870
﻿Wake up

20:45.456 --> 20:48.624
﻿It’s eight o'clock, we're gonna be late.

21:10.564 --> 21:12.815
﻿Daddy, what do you have to eat?

21:13.734 --> 21:15.318
﻿You have nothing

21:17.571 --> 21:18.988
﻿Want some gefilte fish?

21:19.114 --> 21:21.449
﻿We don’t have time.

21:23.994 --> 21:26.829
﻿There’s a piece of cake.
﻿Put it in a plastic bag.

21:36.924 --> 21:39.717
﻿Daddy, you're always making us late.

21:42.346 --> 21:43.721
﻿Where's my tzitzit?

21:47.309 --> 21:49.394
﻿- Soda is good?
﻿- Yeah, it’s good.

21:52.022 --> 21:53.064
﻿We need to hurry up.

22:06.161 --> 22:07.578
﻿Quick! Quick!

22:08.497 --> 22:10.164
﻿Okay, say the blessing.

22:10.290 --> 22:11.332
﻿Blessed are you…

22:15.754 --> 22:16.796
﻿Quick, it’s late!

22:21.176 --> 22:23.010
﻿We need to feed the chick.

22:24.471 --> 22:25.513
﻿Here's something.

22:25.931 --> 22:26.973
﻿Hurry!

22:30.227 --> 22:31.686
﻿Come on, let’s go.

22:32.020 --> 22:33.062
﻿Do you have everything?

22:35.357 --> 22:37.233
﻿There's someone at the door.

22:37.776 --> 22:39.485
﻿Look, it's just business.

22:40.279 --> 22:42.029
﻿You get me?

22:43.157 --> 22:44.532
﻿I have to take him to school.

22:46.743 --> 22:48.035
﻿I’ll be right back.

22:49.997 --> 22:51.456
﻿Come on. Menashe.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.834
﻿I’m gonna pay you.

22:57.588 --> 22:58.796
﻿I just need a check.

22:59.173 --> 23:00.923
﻿And I need it to go through.

23:01.758 --> 23:03.009
﻿Give me two days.

23:23.739 --> 23:26.058
﻿I figured you were at yeshiva...

23:26.158 --> 23:29.494
﻿We need a rabbi with your smarts.

23:29.745 --> 23:32.079
﻿I had to take my kid to school.

23:32.706 --> 23:37.043
﻿Mop the floors tonight.
﻿It won't happen on its own.

24:18.126 --> 24:20.002
﻿You heard what the Rabbi said.

24:20.504 --> 24:24.423
﻿The Ruv can’t stop me
﻿from attending college.

24:25.384 --> 24:28.678
﻿Wait until your father hears this nonsense!

24:34.643 --> 24:37.436
﻿Does he contribute at all?

24:37.896 --> 24:40.606
﻿No, I take care of the bills.

24:40.941 --> 24:44.193
﻿Praise God,
﻿the real estate market is strong.

24:44.903 --> 24:46.946
﻿I can’t understand Menashe.

24:47.906 --> 24:51.075
﻿My brothers took care
﻿of our sister while she was ill.

24:51.785 --> 24:53.395
﻿We took her to doctors…

24:53.495 --> 24:56.247
﻿for all her treatments.

24:56.540 --> 24:58.040
﻿I never get any thanks.

24:58.750 --> 25:00.668
﻿Thanks? For what?

25:01.378 --> 25:02.779
﻿You don’t even attend minyan!

25:02.879 --> 25:04.630
﻿You see how he speaks to me?

25:04.756 --> 25:05.715
﻿He's never respected me.

25:06.592 --> 25:07.534
﻿Respect?

25:07.634 --> 25:10.553
﻿This is how you dress?
﻿Where’s your hat and coat?

25:11.013 --> 25:12.915
﻿He's inconsiderate to everyone.

25:13.015 --> 25:14.056
﻿Enough!

25:14.474 --> 25:15.516
﻿Sit down.

25:21.773 --> 25:23.800
﻿Why are you so late?

25:23.900 --> 25:27.111
﻿I had to help
﻿the Hispanic guys

25:28.071 --> 25:31.365
﻿stock the shelves.

25:32.367 --> 25:33.352
﻿See this?

25:33.452 --> 25:34.660
﻿A fresh excuse.

25:34.995 --> 25:39.040
﻿What if he has to pick up
﻿his son after school,

25:39.458 --> 25:42.501
﻿but his boss needs him to stay later?

25:43.253 --> 25:44.670
﻿My boss is terrible,

25:44.796 --> 25:47.173
﻿but I can't afford to lose my job.

25:47.299 --> 25:50.551
﻿This is why Rieven
﻿can’t live with you now.

25:51.053 --> 25:56.557
﻿The Talmud says three things
﻿bring a man peace...

25:57.225 --> 25:58.643
﻿A nice wife,

25:59.519 --> 26:01.187
﻿a nice house,

26:01.480 --> 26:03.147
﻿and nice dishes.

26:04.775 --> 26:06.969
﻿The gentiles have broken homes,

26:07.069 --> 26:10.112
﻿and so they have a broken society.

26:11.031 --> 26:13.240
﻿Do you have so little faith in me?

26:13.950 --> 26:17.078
﻿Do you have so little faith in the Torah?

26:19.665 --> 26:21.207
﻿I’m begging you, Ruv.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.626
﻿I barely see my son.

26:25.170 --> 26:26.879
﻿It breaks my heart.

26:27.673 --> 26:30.883
﻿I shouldn’t have taken him from Eizik’s.

26:32.386 --> 26:34.220
﻿But we must work something out.

26:37.140 --> 26:39.100
﻿Okay, I've heard enough.

26:41.728 --> 26:45.189
﻿Rieven will be thrown out of school

26:45.524 --> 26:49.110
﻿if he's not in a two-parent home.

26:50.153 --> 26:54.949
﻿I'll allow Rieven to stay with you
﻿until the memorial.

26:56.576 --> 26:59.578
﻿Then he goes back to Eizik’s.

27:00.539 --> 27:01.956
﻿That's my decision.

27:02.124 --> 27:03.457
﻿One week.

27:05.669 --> 27:08.045
﻿You understand the consequences?

27:11.299 --> 27:12.341
﻿Yes.

28:51.900 --> 28:54.235
﻿Charity...

28:55.320 --> 28:56.987
﻿Help a Jew out.

29:03.119 --> 29:05.663
﻿Don't be anti-Hasidic, give money.

29:12.796 --> 29:14.380
﻿Jews, give charity.

29:17.050 --> 29:18.008
﻿Mr. Jew?

29:19.219 --> 29:20.636
﻿Help me, please?

29:22.180 --> 29:23.999
﻿I’m getting married. I'm an orphan.

29:24.099 --> 29:26.058
﻿I’m the great-grandson
﻿of the Sanzer Rabbi.

29:27.394 --> 29:30.437
﻿Don’t get married.
﻿It’s better for your health.

29:31.273 --> 29:33.315
﻿Don't be anti-Hasidic!

29:51.167 --> 29:52.251
﻿What did you learn in school today?

29:53.169 --> 29:56.839
﻿We learned about the dead.

29:59.301 --> 30:01.135
﻿About cemeteries?

30:01.303 --> 30:04.054
﻿Yes, that you must be respectful.

30:05.223 --> 30:08.100
﻿You may not eat or drink there.

30:08.435 --> 30:10.894
﻿You can't do business there.

30:16.276 --> 30:18.319
﻿Let’s read something more cheerful.

30:18.528 --> 30:20.904
﻿I studied this passage last week.

30:23.783 --> 30:25.868
﻿Yehuda ben Teima says…

30:26.661 --> 30:29.371
﻿"Be bold as a leopard."

30:29.497 --> 30:30.539
﻿What's a leopard?

30:38.548 --> 30:39.715
﻿Just like a cat.

30:43.053 --> 30:44.803
﻿"And be light like an eagle."

30:45.013 --> 30:47.306
﻿An eagle flies high...

30:51.227 --> 30:52.895
﻿"And mighty as a lion.”

30:54.356 --> 30:55.981
﻿How does a lion sound?

30:57.359 --> 30:58.400
﻿You do it.

31:03.031 --> 31:04.698
﻿No, you sound like a cow.

31:05.116 --> 31:06.158
﻿A lion!

31:17.671 --> 31:18.921
﻿Finish your homework?

31:19.130 --> 31:20.172
﻿Yeah.

31:21.758 --> 31:23.801
﻿- Read a book.
﻿- Okay, okay.

31:33.687 --> 31:34.728
﻿Ruveleh, what are you doing?

31:36.981 --> 31:39.024
﻿Daddy, look what I found

31:44.447 --> 31:45.489
﻿What's this?

31:56.292 --> 31:58.001
﻿I still feel badly.

31:58.169 --> 32:00.379
﻿We had a fight that day.

32:09.806 --> 32:11.890
﻿I don’t want you touching my phone.

32:13.977 --> 32:15.894
﻿Get back to your homework.

32:18.148 --> 32:19.773
﻿You’re not done yet.

32:43.506 --> 32:45.048
﻿Here's what I'm saying.

32:45.175 --> 32:47.843
﻿Apartments are tiny. There's no room.

32:48.219 --> 32:51.472
﻿I have seven kids.
﻿My wife wants more every year.

32:52.140 --> 32:54.725
﻿I can’t do it. Seriously.

32:54.976 --> 32:56.810
﻿A few days ago, I come home,

32:57.020 --> 33:00.063
﻿I found my youngest asleep in the tub.

33:00.231 --> 33:01.273
﻿Is that normal?

33:06.446 --> 33:08.280
﻿Menashe, how are you?

33:08.448 --> 33:09.823
﻿Thanks for coming.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.534
﻿I have a great match for you.

33:12.911 --> 33:14.995
﻿My cousin got a gett.

33:15.246 --> 33:17.289
﻿Her husband hit her.

33:17.582 --> 33:18.916
﻿Wouldn’t let her leave.

33:19.209 --> 33:20.542
﻿But she’s finally divorced.

33:20.710 --> 33:22.336
﻿She’s lovely, really.

33:22.462 --> 33:24.630
﻿She looks good, really good.

33:26.591 --> 33:27.992
﻿I’m okay.

33:28.092 --> 33:29.176
﻿How old are her kids?

33:29.302 --> 33:32.038
﻿One is six. The twins are three.

33:32.138 --> 33:33.514
﻿Boys or girls?

33:33.640 --> 33:35.599
﻿Two boys and a girl.

33:35.767 --> 33:36.850
﻿Don’t want to hear it.

35:20.747 --> 35:21.788
﻿Uncle?

36:14.467 --> 36:16.218
﻿Careful where you walk.

36:16.469 --> 36:18.428
﻿You be careful where you walk.

36:18.846 --> 36:20.264
﻿Think it’s funny?

36:27.730 --> 36:28.814
﻿Think it's shy?

36:31.067 --> 36:33.360
﻿Be careful, he'll fall.

36:53.798 --> 36:55.549
﻿See who’s at the door.

37:03.057 --> 37:04.599
﻿What are you doing here?

37:05.810 --> 37:06.852
﻿What?

37:07.145 --> 37:09.354
﻿Rieven called to say you were drunk.

37:09.480 --> 37:10.981
﻿I'm taking him home.

37:12.483 --> 37:14.901
﻿Ruveleh, you used my phone?

37:15.194 --> 37:16.236
﻿Yeah.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.865
﻿Don't you want to be with me?

37:23.494 --> 37:24.870
﻿I didn’t mean it.

37:27.165 --> 37:28.206
﻿He wants to stay.

37:28.875 --> 37:31.251
﻿Don’t come by here without calling.

37:31.502 --> 37:33.170
﻿Is this a joke?

37:33.338 --> 37:34.921
﻿See me laughing

37:35.840 --> 37:38.300
﻿You forget what we discussed with the Ruv.

37:38.426 --> 37:40.052
﻿You’ve lost your mind.

37:40.428 --> 37:42.387
﻿Stop banging on the teapot.

37:42.555 --> 37:45.098
﻿I can take care of my son.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.642
﻿I’ll believe it when I see it.

37:48.227 --> 37:51.938
﻿You're holier than the Ruv now?

37:52.065 --> 37:53.231
﻿Enough!

37:53.733 --> 37:55.525
﻿Rieven is my son,

37:55.651 --> 37:56.777
﻿and Leah was my wife.

37:57.070 --> 37:59.404
﻿I don't need any meddlers.

38:03.368 --> 38:07.204
﻿And Leah’s memorial will be at my home.

38:08.331 --> 38:09.790
﻿Enough of your squeaking.

38:09.999 --> 38:12.793
﻿Everyone will see you're a fool.

38:32.939 --> 38:34.022
﻿I’m sorry.

38:34.774 --> 38:37.234
﻿I can’t believe you called Eizik!

38:40.113 --> 38:42.989
﻿Don’t you ever use my phone again.

38:44.575 --> 38:45.518
﻿Got it?

38:45.618 --> 38:46.660
﻿Yes.

38:53.626 --> 38:56.211
﻿Okay, get ready. It’s late.

38:58.214 --> 38:59.339
﻿Time for bed.

41:43.838 --> 41:46.214
﻿- Hello?
﻿- Shloime? Menashe.

41:46.841 --> 41:48.383
﻿Menashe Schwartz?

41:48.718 --> 41:50.093
﻿No, your cousin.

41:51.470 --> 41:52.512
﻿What's going on?

41:53.889 --> 41:57.976
﻿I’m hosting a memorial dinner at my place.

41:58.102 --> 41:59.227
﻿Can you come?

41:59.353 --> 42:00.812
﻿Maybe…

42:00.938 --> 42:02.689
﻿Is Eizik okay with that?

42:02.815 --> 42:05.984
﻿Forget Eizik. She was my wife.

42:07.028 --> 42:10.322
﻿Fine. Whatever's best.

42:10.698 --> 42:13.116
﻿Can I help? Bring anything

42:13.242 --> 42:15.994
﻿No, I’ll take care of it.

42:16.329 --> 42:17.271
﻿You're sure?

42:17.371 --> 42:18.663
﻿Thanks. Bye.

42:28.799 --> 42:31.635
﻿We should decorate for the memorial.

42:32.053 --> 42:33.553
﻿Let's buy that one.

42:34.138 --> 42:36.389
﻿He's wearing a nice hat and coat.

42:36.515 --> 42:38.058
﻿Mom would’ve liked it.

42:38.851 --> 42:40.518
﻿The holy Minchas Elazar.

42:40.770 --> 42:42.187
﻿But it’s not painted well.

42:45.316 --> 42:48.109
﻿So let’s get that one with the book.

42:48.277 --> 42:49.611
﻿The Chasam Sofer?

42:51.489 --> 42:53.698
﻿We already own one like it.

42:53.824 --> 42:54.949
﻿What do you think of this one?

42:55.910 --> 42:58.787
﻿Rabbi Shayele Kerestirer.

42:59.080 --> 43:03.958
﻿They say that his portrait keeps the mice away.

43:04.085 --> 43:06.044
﻿It's a miracle.

43:07.755 --> 43:09.798
﻿- Let's buy that one?
﻿- Yes.

43:11.342 --> 43:13.009
﻿It’s nicely drawn.

43:15.012 --> 43:17.013
﻿Very authentic.

43:24.772 --> 43:26.690
﻿You’re not stronger than Daddy.

43:31.112 --> 43:32.362
﻿You must listen.

43:32.655 --> 43:33.905
﻿Let go.

43:39.161 --> 43:40.203
﻿I give up.

43:47.586 --> 43:49.170
﻿Okay, nail it in.

44:41.474 --> 44:44.309
﻿I have a son

44:46.228 --> 44:47.604
﻿for the memorial dinner.

44:47.980 --> 44:49.022
﻿Let’s hear it.

44:54.028 --> 44:56.488
﻿Once the mother went away

44:57.031 --> 44:58.990
﻿and did not come back home.

44:59.617 --> 45:01.201
﻿And Yankele and Shloimele.

45:01.410 --> 45:04.037
﻿Nobody wants to hear a song like that.

45:04.622 --> 45:06.998
﻿Sing something happier.

45:26.977 --> 45:28.478
﻿You said you’d be quick.

45:28.896 --> 45:30.230
﻿It will be quick.

45:48.082 --> 45:49.374
﻿You promised me ice cream.

45:49.959 --> 45:51.251
﻿Not now. Soon.

45:55.673 --> 45:56.714
﻿You stink of fish.

45:57.842 --> 46:01.162
﻿- Get out of the way, please.
﻿-I don’t want to be here.

46:01.262 --> 46:02.303
﻿Let's go.

46:08.310 --> 46:09.644
﻿Get off of that!

46:09.979 --> 46:11.521
﻿It’s dangerous

46:20.406 --> 46:22.490
﻿Why are you in a crazy mood?

46:23.742 --> 46:25.118
﻿Put on your seatbelt.

46:45.973 --> 46:47.015
﻿What happened

46:48.517 --> 46:50.435
﻿Help me clean up this mess.

47:32.102 --> 47:34.395
﻿Something happened with the fish.

47:35.397 --> 47:36.064
﻿What?

47:36.398 --> 47:39.067
﻿I made a turn,

47:40.027 --> 47:42.111
﻿then I heard a crash.

47:42.529 --> 47:44.864
﻿All the fish fell out. The boxes broke.

47:44.990 --> 47:46.699
﻿- Everything broke?
﻿- All the fish.

47:46.909 --> 47:48.993
﻿All of it was ruined?

47:52.873 --> 47:55.249
﻿Should I laugh or cry here?

47:57.836 --> 48:00.463
﻿-I wasn’t speeding.
﻿- You weren’t speeding?

48:00.756 --> 48:04.968
﻿I made a left, then stopped.

48:05.552 --> 48:08.429
﻿Turned around and heard a crash.

48:09.932 --> 48:11.516
﻿Then all the fish flew out.

48:14.603 --> 48:17.047
﻿You know how much that cost?
﻿Over $1,000.

48:17.147 --> 48:18.940
﻿-I know.
﻿- You know?

48:19.858 --> 48:20.926
﻿You are such a schlimazel.

48:21.026 --> 48:24.237
﻿It's nothing but problems with you.

48:25.698 --> 48:27.615
﻿Be healthy and well. Goodnight.

48:33.664 --> 48:36.040
﻿Should I reimburse you?

48:48.470 --> 48:49.830
﻿Can I ask you something?

48:49.930 --> 48:51.347
﻿What now?

48:52.266 --> 48:53.542
﻿Last week we talked about a loan.

48:53.642 --> 48:54.851
﻿Can I still get it?

48:57.229 --> 49:00.189
﻿Are you serious? After all that?

49:00.691 --> 49:01.816
﻿You’re not ashamed?

49:02.109 --> 49:04.777
﻿You think I have extra money?

49:05.738 --> 49:07.655
﻿I don’t have money, either.

49:07.781 --> 49:08.823
﻿Shut up.

49:09.450 --> 49:13.411
﻿Work the night shift this week,

49:13.912 --> 49:15.663
﻿and then well see.

49:15.998 --> 49:17.040
﻿Maybe.

49:17.958 --> 49:20.251
﻿-I can’t...
﻿- Be well.

50:09.927 --> 50:11.719
﻿Babies are sweet.

50:12.971 --> 50:14.013
﻿Know why?

50:14.932 --> 50:18.518
﻿They don’t need to be big shots.

50:26.026 --> 50:28.611
﻿Why must a Jew be clean?

50:31.448 --> 50:35.451
﻿Being clean on the outside
﻿makes you clean on the inside.

50:48.173 --> 50:50.091
﻿Menashe, it's been a while.

50:50.259 --> 50:51.134
﻿How can I help you?

50:52.094 --> 50:53.136
﻿Sorry to bother.

50:53.679 --> 50:56.931
﻿I’m wondering if you had a recipe for kugel?

50:58.016 --> 50:59.058
﻿Since when do you cook?

50:59.226 --> 51:00.268
﻿Grandma, who is it?

51:01.270 --> 51:02.520
﻿It's just the neighbor.

51:03.856 --> 51:05.648
﻿So you're a homemaker now?

51:06.150 --> 51:08.025
﻿It's for my wife's memorial dinner.

51:08.235 --> 51:09.944
﻿Then let me bake it for you.

51:10.362 --> 51:11.654
﻿No, I want to do it.

51:12.489 --> 51:13.990
﻿Could I borrow a cookbook?

51:15.450 --> 51:16.742
﻿I’ll write a recipe for you.

51:19.705 --> 51:22.415
﻿Even a bear can learn to dance, they say.

51:30.883 --> 51:31.784
﻿Good evenin

51:31.884 --> 51:32.925
﻿Mrs. Klein, right?

51:35.679 --> 51:36.804
﻿Good evening.

51:38.891 --> 51:41.392
﻿Please tell your son to calm down.

51:41.643 --> 51:43.686
﻿I hear him jumping
﻿on the bed half the night.

51:45.272 --> 51:47.190
﻿He's a handful sometimes.

51:48.066 --> 51:50.818
﻿But I'm grateful to have him home.

51:52.863 --> 51:54.739
﻿How's your family lately?

51:57.284 --> 51:58.659
﻿My family is large,

51:59.036 --> 52:00.870
﻿and their problems even larger.

52:13.717 --> 52:17.220
﻿This recipe is bachelor-proof.

52:30.943 --> 52:31.984
﻿You could help me a little?

52:43.121 --> 52:44.163
﻿What's this about?

52:44.289 --> 52:46.290
﻿Quick, bring me some towels.

53:09.273 --> 53:10.314
﻿You shouldn’t be so wild.

53:26.164 --> 53:27.983
﻿Put up your other hand.

53:28.083 --> 53:29.375
﻿No, the other one.

53:30.085 --> 53:31.252
﻿Hold it tight.

54:17.174 --> 54:18.549
﻿Where’s this money from?

54:20.469 --> 54:22.970
﻿It’s for Mommy’s memorial.

54:24.389 --> 54:25.890
﻿Who gave it to you?

54:28.894 --> 54:29.935
﻿My uncle.

54:31.772 --> 54:32.813
﻿What?

54:34.358 --> 54:36.233
﻿I don’t need his money.

54:38.195 --> 54:43.282
﻿Uncle says you never took care of Mom…

54:43.492 --> 54:45.409
﻿even when she was sick.

54:47.454 --> 54:48.438
﻿What?

54:48.538 --> 54:49.580
﻿It’s true.

01:02:06.392 --> 01:02:09.353
﻿Rieven isn't home.
﻿He's shopping with Henchi.

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.190
﻿I’m here to speak with you.

01:02:13.441 --> 01:02:14.900
﻿Make it quick.

01:02:16.819 --> 01:02:18.612
﻿I wanted to tell you that…

01:02:20.114 --> 01:02:23.143
﻿you've got a real home.

01:02:23.243 --> 01:02:25.869
﻿Yankey and Chaim get along.

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:30.207
﻿I don’t have that.

01:02:32.877 --> 01:02:34.670
﻿My boy isn't with me.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.922
﻿And my job.

01:02:37.674 --> 01:02:38.590
﻿It’s a struggle.

01:02:39.133 --> 01:02:40.175
﻿It’s tough.

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:44.289
﻿You have a normal livelihood.

01:02:44.389 --> 01:02:47.099
﻿I don’t know how you’re successful, but…

01:02:48.893 --> 01:02:52.005
﻿I try so hard to make things right.

01:02:52.105 --> 01:02:54.106
﻿I’m trying to improve.

01:03:04.492 --> 01:03:06.785
﻿I know, but let's see you become a mensch.

01:03:08.413 --> 01:03:09.705
﻿The memorial dinner is tomorrow.

01:03:11.874 --> 01:03:14.334
﻿I want to show you I can do this…

01:03:14.961 --> 01:03:17.254
﻿at my home.

01:03:20.091 --> 01:03:22.426
﻿I can organize everything.

01:03:24.137 --> 01:03:26.013
﻿The Ruv is coming.

01:03:26.806 --> 01:03:29.182
﻿It would be easier at my home.

01:03:31.352 --> 01:03:34.672
﻿Let me show you I can be independent.

01:03:34.772 --> 01:03:36.732
﻿Come and see.

01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:39.359
﻿We'll see tomorrow.

01:04:00.006 --> 01:04:03.258
﻿May her soul rest in peace.

01:07:30.299 --> 01:07:32.342
﻿Something's burning!

01:07:36.055 --> 01:07:37.430
﻿It's smokin !

01:07:40.351 --> 01:07:42.644
﻿What’s going on in there?

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:44.229
﻿It’s nothing. I put it out.

01:07:44.397 --> 01:07:46.481
﻿What's this smoke?

01:07:47.149 --> 01:07:48.066
﻿This schlimazel.

01:07:48.359 --> 01:07:49.552
﻿Let's just go to your house.

01:07:49.652 --> 01:07:53.780
﻿The memorial must be held
﻿in her husband and son's home!

01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:56.491
﻿But the room is full of smoke.

01:07:57.118 --> 01:07:59.369
﻿Wash and sit down.

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.372
﻿We’re gonna choke in here.

01:08:03.332 --> 01:08:05.750
﻿Do me a favor and sit down.

01:08:08.546 --> 01:08:10.547
﻿The Ruv can sit there.

01:08:19.223 --> 01:08:20.724
﻿Does the Ruv want to wash?

01:08:43.663 --> 01:08:45.540
﻿How’s work?

01:08:46.334 --> 01:08:48.542
﻿He does Amazon.

01:08:48.711 --> 01:08:50.587
﻿A Hasid on Amazon?

01:08:51.046 --> 01:08:52.296
﻿Does the Ruv allow it?

01:08:52.965 --> 01:08:54.591
﻿Where are the women?

01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.594
﻿Over at Fruma's house.

01:08:59.513 --> 01:09:02.182
﻿This has the aftertaste of a freezer.

01:09:02.892 --> 01:09:04.643
﻿Anyone want some more?

01:09:13.861 --> 01:09:16.279
﻿Can we make the blessing?

01:09:16.906 --> 01:09:20.533
﻿The law states that
﻿kugel and wine are enough.

01:09:21.243 --> 01:09:23.536
﻿You didn't eat the kugel?

01:09:24.162 --> 01:09:26.747
﻿I didn't notice anything wrong.

01:09:26.874 --> 01:09:29.626
﻿It doesn't taste like potatoes.

01:09:34.381 --> 01:09:37.550
﻿How could a kugel such as this...

01:09:37.718 --> 01:09:40.804
﻿not be fit for a king?

01:09:42.515 --> 01:09:44.182
﻿It’s burnt.

01:09:44.308 --> 01:09:46.393
﻿It has no flavor.

01:09:50.523 --> 01:09:52.357
﻿It tastes fine to me.

01:10:06.956 --> 01:10:08.498
﻿Let’s drink a I’chaim.

01:10:16.465 --> 01:10:17.757
﻿Her soul is in Heaven.

01:10:18.217 --> 01:10:21.136
﻿She prays before the Creator

01:10:21.262 --> 01:10:24.973
﻿that you may raise Rieven well.

01:10:25.099 --> 01:10:26.558
﻿All should say of your son,

01:10:26.934 --> 01:10:30.687
﻿praised be his father.

01:10:32.231 --> 01:10:37.527
﻿You should pray for your mother's soul.

01:10:46.996 --> 01:10:50.206
﻿Sing Mommy’s favorite song.

01:11:00.134 --> 01:11:03.595
﻿Once the mother went away

01:11:04.055 --> 01:11:06.556
﻿and did not come back home.

01:11:07.475 --> 01:11:10.226
﻿And Yankele and Shloimele

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:13.146
﻿went deep into the woods.

01:11:13.856 --> 01:11:16.858
﻿Oh little bear, oh little bear,

01:11:17.276 --> 01:11:19.652
﻿please do not eat me.

01:11:20.446 --> 01:11:23.073
﻿Mother will come back to us

01:11:23.532 --> 01:11:25.700
﻿and bake us cookies, too.

01:11:26.118 --> 01:11:28.870
﻿The little bear went far away,

01:11:29.038 --> 01:11:31.247
﻿the children stood there still.

01:11:31.457 --> 01:11:33.666
﻿And then the woods were filled with joy

01:11:34.085 --> 01:11:35.919
﻿when mother came back home.

01:11:40.925 --> 01:11:42.467
﻿You sing beautifully.

01:11:43.594 --> 01:11:45.178
﻿You had a very dear mother.

01:11:46.305 --> 01:11:50.183
﻿She'll always protect you.

01:11:52.812 --> 01:11:54.687
﻿Let us sing.

01:12:28.556 --> 01:12:31.307
﻿Goodnight. May Leah rest peacefully.

01:12:31.892 --> 01:12:33.393
﻿May you raise the child well.

01:12:34.603 --> 01:12:35.770
﻿Good luck. Thank you.

01:12:43.237 --> 01:12:46.114
﻿This was an honor for the soul.

01:12:46.699 --> 01:12:49.117
﻿She will pray for you…

01:12:49.618 --> 01:12:51.703
﻿I tried. What can I say?

01:12:53.414 --> 01:12:54.456
﻿Have a good night.

01:13:00.212 --> 01:13:02.881
﻿I know I’m not perfect.

01:13:04.133 --> 01:13:07.051
﻿My son is my only consolation.

01:13:07.344 --> 01:13:09.471
﻿Why must he leave me?

01:13:14.894 --> 01:13:16.853
﻿The Torah says.

01:13:18.898 --> 01:13:20.815
﻿"Man should not be alone."

01:13:22.818 --> 01:13:25.445
﻿"I shall make him a companion."

01:13:29.909 --> 01:13:31.367
﻿As the Ruv said.

01:13:33.871 --> 01:13:38.208
﻿Once you find a wife,
﻿Rieven will return to live with you.

01:13:38.834 --> 01:13:40.126
﻿As we a reed?

01:13:53.265 --> 01:13:55.793
﻿All right,
﻿I'll bring Rieven to you tomorrow.

01:13:55.893 --> 01:13:58.019
﻿And I'll speak with the matchmaker.

01:14:00.648 --> 01:14:03.066
﻿Great, good luck.

01:14:03.275 --> 01:14:05.276
﻿Have a good night.

01:14:22.878 --> 01:14:24.546
﻿Ruveleh, are you ready for bed?

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:25.922
﻿Almost.

01:14:34.265 --> 01:14:36.182
﻿Today was a good day, right?

01:14:36.517 --> 01:14:37.767
﻿I think so.

01:14:39.103 --> 01:14:41.312
﻿Do you think Mom would have been proud?

01:14:43.983 --> 01:14:45.066
﻿Of course.

01:14:46.652 --> 01:14:50.029
﻿She'd be very proud of how you sang.

01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:54.200
﻿Time for bed?

01:15:11.135 --> 01:15:12.802
﻿I want to stay here.

01:15:25.149 --> 01:15:26.357
﻿Did you say the Shema?

01:15:27.305 --> 01:15:33.742
