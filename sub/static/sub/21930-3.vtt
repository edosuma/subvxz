00:02.518 --> 00:04.168
Hmm. Some news
of our wedding.

00:04.168 --> 00:05.352
I have sent you all

00:05.353 --> 00:06.819
a "save the date" e-mail.

00:06.820 --> 00:08.453
Oh, exciting.
You guys picked a date?

00:08.455 --> 00:10.722
Better.
I picked 80 dates.

00:10.724 --> 00:11.757
And I need you

00:11.759 --> 00:13.859
to save them all until
we narrow it down.

00:13.861 --> 00:16.528
I thought we agreed
on June 15.

00:16.530 --> 00:18.497
That's the day after Flag Day.

00:18.499 --> 00:20.599
Everyone'll be partied out.

00:21.902 --> 00:24.202
It's a date-- just pick one.

00:24.204 --> 00:26.772
It's not just a date-- it's a
textbook optimization problem.

00:26.774 --> 00:28.941
There is a perfect date--
just like there's

00:28.943 --> 00:31.543
a perfect room temperature
and a perfect dessert.

00:31.545 --> 00:33.378
Mm. There's no perfect dessert.

00:33.380 --> 00:35.013
Yellow cake
in the shape of a dinosaur

00:35.015 --> 00:36.982
with chocolate frosting,
a scoop of vanilla ice cream

00:36.984 --> 00:39.017
on the side, not touching.

00:39.019 --> 00:39.952
You'll see.

00:39.954 --> 00:42.254
You'll have it at our wedding.

00:42.990 --> 00:45.057
You wanna bet?

00:45.059 --> 00:46.058
SHELDON:
You give me

00:46.060 --> 00:47.659
enough time,
I can do the same thing

00:47.661 --> 00:49.928
with a wedding date--
it needs to be on the weekend,

00:49.930 --> 00:51.763
uh, not near
any of your birthdays,

00:51.765 --> 00:53.165
or the weekend of Comic Con.

00:53.167 --> 00:54.967
Ooh, you could get
married <i>at</i> Comic Con.

00:54.969 --> 00:57.469
AMY and PENNY and BERNADETTE:
No!

00:57.471 --> 00:58.837
We just need
a weekend date

00:58.839 --> 01:00.439
that's completely
boring and uneventful.

01:00.441 --> 01:02.841
Too bad you didn't get
your ducks in a row,

01:02.843 --> 01:05.844
'cause tonight
would have been perfect.

That's fine.
I'll have anything.

"Whatev"?

01:58.135 --> 02:00.102
I like this side of you.

02:00.104 --> 02:02.004

Hey, just a reminder--

02:27.899 --> 02:29.114
I'm going out for
drinks after work.

02:29.138 --> 02:30.200
Oh. Great.

02:30.201 --> 02:32.902
Just a reminder--
you're pregnant.

02:32.904 --> 02:36.305
I'm not drinking,
just taking a new coworker out.

02:36.307 --> 02:39.609
Oh. Just a reminder--
you're married.

02:40.445 --> 02:42.245
Female coworker.

02:42.247 --> 02:44.614
She's new in town, and I want
to make her feel welcome.

02:44.616 --> 02:46.916
And let her know
the office is full of liars

02:46.918 --> 02:49.652
before everyone
tells her I'm mean.

02:49.654 --> 02:51.254
Is she single?

02:51.256 --> 02:53.756
I'm not setting her up with Raj.

02:53.758 --> 02:55.091
What about Stuart?
Are you listening?

02:55.093 --> 02:58.127
I want her to think
I'm not mean.

02:58.129 --> 02:59.962
Okay. Well,
it's just...

02:59.964 --> 03:02.031
we have two single friends.

03:02.033 --> 03:04.233
Howie, I just met this woman.

03:04.235 --> 03:06.969
Why don't I wait a little
and get to know her?

03:06.971 --> 03:09.205
Maybe I won't like her,
and then I'd be happy

03:09.207 --> 03:11.407
to ruin her life
with Stuart or Raj.

03:12.210 --> 03:14.744
(whispers):
That's all I ask.

03:17.515 --> 03:19.548
So, you guys lived
with Sheldon for a long time...

03:19.550 --> 03:22.151
<i>Long</i> time.
So very long.

03:23.221 --> 03:25.388
By the way, congratulations
again on your engagement.

03:25.390 --> 03:28.758
Yeah. You got a good one.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.393
Thanks. So, it's strange,

03:30.395 --> 03:32.862
Sheldon was talking
in his sleep last night,

03:32.864 --> 03:35.331
and he seemed like
a totally different person.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.400
He was relaxed and...

03:37.402 --> 03:39.535
loose and calm.

03:39.537 --> 03:41.537
Well, Sheldon's
a complicated man.

03:41.539 --> 03:43.072
He said "whatev."

03:43.074 --> 03:46.042
Give him a brain scan--
that might be a tumor.

03:46.044 --> 03:48.377
Well, I think
the wedding planning

03:48.379 --> 03:51.747
is really stressful for him, and
that can trigger sleep talking.

03:51.749 --> 03:53.616
Well, maybe this is a part
of Sheldon's personality

03:53.618 --> 03:55.017
he's been repressing.

03:55.019 --> 03:56.619
I mean, I think we
dream about things

03:56.621 --> 03:58.321
we wish we could
be in real life.

03:58.323 --> 04:00.089
Really? What do you dream about?

04:00.091 --> 04:03.392
Oh. Uh... being the
wife of Leonard.

04:03.394 --> 04:04.794
Mostly that.

04:06.698 --> 04:09.498
I choose to believe you.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.867
Well, as much as we've studied
the brain, there's still a lot

04:11.869 --> 04:13.469
we don't know about dreams
and their function.

04:13.471 --> 04:15.504
You know, even psychologists
are divided on it.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.839
Mm, it's true-- Freud
thought dreams were about sex,

04:17.841 --> 04:19.228
Adler thought they
were about dominance...

04:19.230 --> 04:20.007
Then again,

04:20.011 --> 04:23.813
mine are just about being
married to this little guy.

04:23.815 --> 04:27.116
Well, now it's
just edging into mockery.

04:29.554 --> 04:32.188
Well, moving to a new city
was a little scary,

04:32.190 --> 04:33.656
but the job seems great.

04:33.658 --> 04:35.124
Everyone's really nice.

04:35.126 --> 04:37.026
Oh, they are.
Super nice.

04:37.028 --> 04:39.261
I mean, only one them
took you out tonight--

04:39.263 --> 04:41.364
but it's not a competition.

04:41.366 --> 04:42.598
Thanks again.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.600
You know,
we could have gone somewhere

04:44.602 --> 04:46.702
more pregnancy-friendly.

04:46.704 --> 04:48.537
Oh, it's okay.
One of the great things

04:48.539 --> 04:50.706
about being pregnant
is drinking cranberry juice

04:50.708 --> 04:53.809
out of a wineglass
and watching people freak out.

04:53.811 --> 04:55.578
Bernie!

04:56.314 --> 04:58.014
Oh, damn.

04:59.150 --> 05:02.051
Hey! What are the odds?

05:02.053 --> 05:05.554
Yeah, seren-frickin'-dipity.

05:05.556 --> 05:06.689
Hello.

05:06.691 --> 05:08.491
- Rajesh.
- Stuart.

05:08.493 --> 05:09.325
Hi. Ruchi.

05:09.327 --> 05:11.327
Ruchi is
my coworker.

05:11.329 --> 05:14.230
But that was probably
in your briefing packet.

05:17.035 --> 05:18.934
(door opens)

05:20.605 --> 05:21.937
Hi.

05:21.939 --> 05:23.239
Hello.

05:23.241 --> 05:24.573
What's wrong?

05:24.575 --> 05:27.109
Well, I found the
perfect wedding date.

05:27.111 --> 05:28.778
- That's terrific!
- No, it's not.

05:28.780 --> 05:32.782
It was May 19, 1996.

05:33.718 --> 05:35.384
We would have had
a lovely wedding.

05:35.386 --> 05:36.952
And our honeymoon
would have coincided

05:36.954 --> 05:40.589
with the first appearance
of the Hale-Bopp comet.

05:40.591 --> 05:41.991
Sheldon, you were 16.

05:41.993 --> 05:44.894
And in Texas-- no one
would have batted an eye.

05:44.896 --> 05:46.495
Oh, wait, it's no good.

05:46.497 --> 05:49.198
That's the day that Jon Pertwee,
the third Doctor Who, died.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.566
And it's in the past.

05:50.568 --> 05:53.002
Hey-hey, I said it's no
good-- just let it go.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.737
Sheldon...

05:54.739 --> 05:57.773
I appreciate you trying
to make this wedding perfect,

05:57.775 --> 06:00.076
but it's making
you miserable.

06:00.078 --> 06:02.278
No, the wedding isn't
making me miserable,

06:02.280 --> 06:03.446
the calendar is.

06:03.448 --> 06:05.815
Why can't there just be
one week each month

06:05.817 --> 06:08.417
for famous people to die?

06:08.419 --> 06:10.519
Well, they've already
arranged to die in threes--

06:10.521 --> 06:12.655
what more do you
want from them?

06:12.657 --> 06:16.125
This is so frustrating.
Why can't I find a perfect date?

06:16.127 --> 06:19.261
I found the perfect way to say
hi to cowboys. (clicks tongue)

06:20.832 --> 06:24.166
I'm just saying maybe there's
a part of you deep down that...

06:24.168 --> 06:26.735
just wants to relax
a little, you know?

06:26.737 --> 06:28.137
Kick back.

06:28.139 --> 06:30.639
Say, "Whatev."

06:30.641 --> 06:33.142
Whatev?

06:33.144 --> 06:35.644
I'm sorry, you're really not
gonna finish that word?

06:35.646 --> 06:38.013
I-I'm just trying
to make a point...

06:38.015 --> 06:39.482
Finish the word, Amy.

06:39.484 --> 06:41.784
Fine. Er.

06:42.787 --> 06:43.886
Er, er, er.

06:43.888 --> 06:44.954
Thank you.

06:44.956 --> 06:47.790
Only now you owe me
three more whatevs.

06:49.894 --> 06:52.094
Oh, you were born
in Trivandrum.

06:52.096 --> 06:55.064
Have you ever been
to the Kuthira Malika Palace?

06:55.066 --> 06:56.332
No, I haven't.

06:56.334 --> 06:59.034
Me, either.
What a small world.

07:00.171 --> 07:01.904
I've also never
been there.

07:01.906 --> 07:03.672
I've never been
lots of places.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.741
Go on, quiz me.

07:05.743 --> 07:08.277
I'm sorry, we're being rude
talking about India.

07:08.279 --> 07:10.045
Oh, yeah, you know,
if you and Bernadette

07:10.047 --> 07:12.181
want to talk about America,
that's cool with us.

07:12.183 --> 07:13.682
Here, let me get you started.

07:13.684 --> 07:16.752
(American accent):
Hamburgers. Am I right?

07:18.189 --> 07:19.922
So, what do you guys do?

07:19.924 --> 07:21.891
Well, I am an astrophysicist,

07:21.893 --> 07:25.561
so if you ever go out at night
and look up at the stars,

07:25.563 --> 07:27.329
that's kind of my office.

07:28.332 --> 07:31.433
He sells comic books
to children.

07:31.435 --> 07:32.868
STUART:
Actually,

07:32.870 --> 07:35.237
I own my own store.
Uh, i-if you'd like

07:35.239 --> 07:37.973
to check it out sometime,
I'm running a new promotion--

07:37.975 --> 07:42.111
buy anything, get taken out
for a reasonably priced dinner.

07:42.113 --> 07:45.281
Yeah, yeah, Stuart's
struggling financially.

07:45.283 --> 07:46.882
But he doesn't let that
get him down.

07:46.884 --> 07:47.983
He believes in himself.

07:47.985 --> 07:50.152
Even though the whole world
has made it clear

07:50.154 --> 07:52.555
he should not.

07:54.192 --> 07:55.991
Thank you.

07:55.993 --> 07:58.194
A-And, you know, Raj,
I think it's great

07:58.196 --> 08:01.363
that you no longer live off your
parents like a spoiled child.

08:01.365 --> 08:03.866
You live over someone's
garage like a...

08:03.868 --> 08:05.734
failed adult.

08:06.504 --> 08:08.537
Yeah, well,
you live with her.

08:09.407 --> 08:10.606
Oh, it's not like that.

08:10.608 --> 08:12.741
He rents a room
from me and my husband.

08:12.743 --> 08:15.744
Who, by the way,
is no prize, either.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.283
Oh, I don't care.

08:21.285 --> 08:24.520
You know me--
I just go with the flow.

08:26.724 --> 08:29.358
Beach, public pool...

08:29.360 --> 08:32.294
They both sound awesome.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.432
SHELDON (recorded):
On second thought, beach.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.201
I'd like to befriend a seagull.

08:40.037 --> 08:41.904
That is crazy.

08:41.905 --> 08:45.207
Yeah. Will you
e-mail that to me?

08:46.177 --> 08:47.810
Have you played
this for him?

08:47.812 --> 08:50.579
No. I'm worried he'll say
I violated his privacy.

08:50.581 --> 08:52.615
Listen how happy he sounds.

08:52.617 --> 08:54.717
I'm up for anything,

08:54.719 --> 08:57.720
as long as I'm with you.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.990
- What are you listening to?
- Nothing.

09:00.992 --> 09:03.192
Oh, come on,
I want to hear.

09:04.795 --> 09:07.363
We don't need GPS.

09:07.365 --> 09:10.666
Let's just see
where the road takes us.

09:11.502 --> 09:13.269
I see why you turned it off.

09:13.271 --> 09:15.271
That guy sounds like an idiot.

09:16.140 --> 09:17.640
Honey, that's you.

09:17.642 --> 09:20.809
Don't be silly.
My voice is deep and sonorous.

09:20.811 --> 09:23.579
Like a Caucasian
James Earl Jones.

09:25.049 --> 09:28.217
"Luke, I am your father." See?

09:28.219 --> 09:29.618
It <i>is</i> you.

09:29.620 --> 09:32.021
I recorded you
in your sleep.

09:32.023 --> 09:34.456
Oh, look-- a hitchhiker.

09:34.458 --> 09:38.661
I bet he has
some interesting stories.

09:38.663 --> 09:40.963
That's me?

09:40.965 --> 09:41.964
It's you.

09:41.966 --> 09:44.867
So you spied on me in my sleep?

09:44.869 --> 09:45.968
Sheldon, I'm sorry.

09:45.970 --> 09:47.503
You've been doing
this every night.

09:47.505 --> 09:50.005
I couldn't help but wonder
if it meant something.

09:50.007 --> 09:50.939
Well, it doesn't.

09:50.941 --> 09:52.541
Are you sure?

09:52.543 --> 09:55.477
I mean, the prefrontal cortex
regulates impulse control.

09:55.479 --> 09:56.779
So it's plausible

09:56.781 --> 09:58.914
that when we're asleep,
aspects of our personality

09:58.916 --> 10:00.783
that we repress might come out.

10:00.785 --> 10:04.620
Don't try to put science
lipstick on your New Age pig!

10:04.622 --> 10:06.288
And for the record,

10:06.290 --> 10:08.657
you make noises when <i>you</i> sleep,
and I've never accused you

10:08.659 --> 10:11.360
of repressing
your inner chainsaw.

10:14.398 --> 10:16.365
If you want me to object
at your wedding,

10:16.367 --> 10:18.467
just give me one of these.

10:28.983 --> 10:31.750
This picture of Galactus
eating a planet looks like

10:31.752 --> 10:34.486
my preggo wife
destroying a coffee cake.

10:36.857 --> 10:39.324
(laughing):
Oh, yeah, I see it.

10:39.326 --> 10:41.160
I'm just saying,
you should bow out.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.028
Why should <i>I</i> bow out?

10:43.030 --> 10:45.397
Uh, because we all know
how this is gonna end.

10:45.399 --> 10:48.867
That's what my doctor said,
too, but I'm still here.

10:51.105 --> 10:55.040
Okay, look, I think that
she and I have more in common.

10:55.042 --> 10:56.975
Because you're Indian?

10:56.977 --> 10:59.678
So just 'cause she's brown,
you get to date her?

10:59.680 --> 11:01.079
Yes!

11:01.081 --> 11:03.081
And the next time
we meet a woman

11:03.083 --> 11:05.684
who's pale and cadaver-like,
she's all yours.

11:06.887 --> 11:09.421
Howard,
Bernadette was there last night.

11:09.423 --> 11:11.356
Did she say anything
when she got home?

11:11.358 --> 11:14.326
Yeah, she said, "Why'd you tell
those idiots where I was?

11:14.328 --> 11:15.694
Thanks a lot."

11:15.696 --> 11:16.902
Okay, how about
we flip a coin?

11:16.926 --> 11:18.264
Look, hang on.

11:18.265 --> 11:20.599
Doesn't this girl get
a word in all of this?

11:20.601 --> 11:23.001
And isn't that word "no"?

11:23.003 --> 11:25.737
Ruchi said she wanted to
hang out with both of us.

11:25.739 --> 11:27.206
Why don't we
just do that?

11:27.208 --> 11:30.576
Oh, fine. Let's hang out
as friends and see what happens.

11:30.578 --> 11:33.278
Yeah, and if something grows out
of it, just worry about it then.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.113
Also what my doctor said.

11:38.686 --> 11:41.720
Hey, this isn't
your laundry night.

11:41.722 --> 11:44.490
I know. Laundry
on a Wednesday.

11:44.492 --> 11:46.592
It's the madness
my life has become.

11:48.162 --> 11:51.129
Why is this sleep-talking thing
bothering you anyway?

11:51.131 --> 11:52.297
It's simple.

11:52.299 --> 11:53.665
I don't like the idea

11:53.667 --> 11:56.468
that my mind might be keeping
an entire personality from me.

11:56.470 --> 11:59.238
Dr. Jekyll's other
personality was Mr. Hyde.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.073
<i>Mr.</i> Hyde.

12:01.075 --> 12:04.710
Didn't have
a postgraduate degree.

12:04.712 --> 12:06.612
Is it possible
that you're stressed

12:06.614 --> 12:08.981
because you're scared
about getting married?

12:08.983 --> 12:10.849
I mean, it is
a big change,

12:10.851 --> 12:12.718
and you're not good
with little changes.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.586
Well, that's nonsense.

12:14.588 --> 12:17.389
You name one little
change I was upset with.

12:17.391 --> 12:21.593
Uh, when they changed the green
Skittle from lime to apple.

12:21.595 --> 12:24.296
That is not the rainbow
I grew up tasting.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.999
All right, fine.
Let's start over.

12:27.001 --> 12:28.267
Is it possible

12:28.269 --> 12:30.602
that the sleep-talking
is a part of your brain

12:30.604 --> 12:32.304
that's telling you
everything's gonna be okay

12:32.306 --> 12:34.373
and you just need
to relax a little?

12:34.375 --> 12:39.011
So you're proposing that
the self is an illusion,

12:39.013 --> 12:41.947
and that we actually
have multiple centers

12:41.949 --> 12:45.250
of consciousness that are
communicating with one another?

12:46.954 --> 12:50.122
In laymen's terms, yeah.

12:50.124 --> 12:52.324
Huh. Interesting.

12:52.326 --> 12:54.960
So you don't believe
there's a Cartesian self

12:54.962 --> 12:57.496
that underlies the
flux of experience?

12:57.498 --> 13:00.132
Maybe in my twenties,
not anymore.

13:01.468 --> 13:05.037
Okay. Well, assuming
you're right,

13:05.039 --> 13:07.172
what would you suggest I do?

13:07.174 --> 13:09.141
Well, I would start
with something small,

13:09.143 --> 13:10.642
see if it makes
your life any better.

13:10.644 --> 13:13.979
Um, you can learn to meditate,
take a yoga class.

13:13.981 --> 13:18.150
Oh. You know, I have always
been intrigued by flip-flops.

13:20.154 --> 13:23.422
The official footwear of
the laid-back fellow.

13:23.424 --> 13:25.657
- Okay, sure.
- Of course if my feet

13:25.659 --> 13:28.327
are gonna be exposed, I'll need
to update my tetanus booster.

13:28.329 --> 13:30.596
Oh, yeah. Makes sense.
Yeah. And while I'm there,

13:30.598 --> 13:32.502
I may as well get a flu
shot and a mole check.

13:32.526 --> 13:34.067
Sure.

13:34.068 --> 13:36.201
You know, I've never
had a mole check.

13:36.203 --> 13:38.003
Ooh!

13:38.005 --> 13:39.905
Well, it's been
nice knowing you.

13:42.676 --> 13:44.209
Here you go.

13:44.211 --> 13:45.744
Thanks.
(chuckles)

13:45.746 --> 13:48.347
It's too bad Stuart couldn't
make it. He seemed fun.

13:48.349 --> 13:51.249
Oh, yeah, he is.
I love him dearly, yeah.

13:51.251 --> 13:53.785
Not to say
that I don't worry about him.

13:53.787 --> 13:55.053
What's to worry about?

13:55.055 --> 13:57.089
You know what?

13:57.091 --> 13:58.991
I'm talking out of school.

14:00.394 --> 14:03.862
Speaking of which, he's allowed
to live near them now.

14:04.832 --> 14:06.832
Hey, guys.

14:06.834 --> 14:08.667
- Oh, great, Stuart. You're here.
- Yeah, Stuart.

14:08.669 --> 14:10.902
Yeah, I did... I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

14:10.904 --> 14:13.071
Mm. I believe that.

14:13.073 --> 14:14.473
(ringtone playing)

14:14.475 --> 14:16.875
Sorry, guys. It's work.
I've got to take it.

14:16.877 --> 14:17.396
Oh.

14:17.420 --> 14:19.078
I'm so glad you
made it, Stuart.

14:19.079 --> 14:22.080
Oh, yeah, so glad.

14:22.082 --> 14:24.216
I can't believe you
went behind my back!

14:24.218 --> 14:26.652
Which clearly means
I want this more!

14:26.654 --> 14:31.289
You want to play a game of
"who's more desperate" with me?

14:31.291 --> 14:34.559
'Cause you're in the
big leagues now, Bucko.

14:34.561 --> 14:36.662
L-Look, Ruchi and I
are really hitting it off.

14:36.664 --> 14:38.330
Please let me just
have this one!

14:38.332 --> 14:39.631
I'm not going anywhere.

14:39.633 --> 14:42.467
I'm like a fungus
you can't get rid of.

14:42.469 --> 14:44.036
Sorry.

14:44.038 --> 14:45.804
So what's
going on?

14:45.806 --> 14:47.673
Oh, you just missed
Stuart's funny story

14:47.675 --> 14:49.941
about the fungus
he can't get rid of.

14:49.943 --> 14:53.278
Raj didn't tell me
about tonight

14:53.280 --> 14:55.313
so he could be
alone with you.

14:55.315 --> 14:57.215
Really?

14:57.217 --> 14:58.583
That's a little weird.

14:58.585 --> 15:01.687
Just a little?
Because I can work with that.

15:01.689 --> 15:05.223
Look, guys, I'm not interested
in dating anyone right now.

15:05.225 --> 15:07.526
I'm just looking
to make some friends.

15:07.528 --> 15:09.227
Yeah, I totally understand.

15:09.229 --> 15:10.962
But if you were
gonna date someone,

15:10.964 --> 15:12.964
would it be me or Stuart?

15:12.966 --> 15:15.267
I think I'm gonna go.

15:15.269 --> 15:18.470
Uh, uh, uh,
uh, Ruchi, I'm sorry.

15:18.472 --> 15:21.339
If you still want to hang out
as friends, I'd like that.

15:21.341 --> 15:23.775
Thanks, Stuart.
I'd like that, too.

15:26.380 --> 15:29.848
And the fungus is
under the toenail.

15:43.530 --> 15:45.897
Hello.

15:45.899 --> 15:47.365
Hey.

15:48.902 --> 15:51.503
So, um, I, uh...

15:52.906 --> 15:55.340
I got flip-flops.

15:56.176 --> 15:58.376
Good for you.

15:58.378 --> 16:00.545
Oh, my God, what happened?!

16:00.547 --> 16:02.781
After I got
the flip-flops,

16:02.783 --> 16:06.618
I realized that the tops of
my feet were exposed, so, um,

16:06.620 --> 16:08.520
I-I put on some sunscreen,

16:08.522 --> 16:10.989
which caused my feet
to become slippery.

16:10.991 --> 16:13.692
And predictably,
one of them fell off

16:13.694 --> 16:15.794
and went down a sewer grate.

16:15.796 --> 16:18.563
Now, normally, I would
have walked away,

16:18.565 --> 16:22.667
but this is a new,
laid-back me, so,

16:22.669 --> 16:26.304
instead of getting upset, I
just reached down to grab it.

16:26.306 --> 16:29.808
That's when I touched
something furry...

16:31.812 --> 16:36.148
...which I'm telling myself
was a damp toupee.

16:37.484 --> 16:40.585
When the toupee
licked my hand...

16:44.191 --> 16:47.192
...I screamed and
hopped down the street

16:47.194 --> 16:49.261
on my remaining flip-flop.

16:49.263 --> 16:51.051
Can I just ask...?

16:51.075 --> 16:52.698
No, this is
a long story.

16:52.699 --> 16:55.934
Why don't we please save
your questions till the end?

16:55.936 --> 16:58.870
So, I-I finally
came upon a bus bench

16:58.872 --> 17:01.706
where I sat and removed
one of my shirts

17:01.708 --> 17:04.943
and, uh, fashioned it
into a makeshift shoe.

17:06.146 --> 17:07.712
Not a waterproof shoe.

17:07.714 --> 17:11.148
That is relevant to the
next part of my story.

17:11.151 --> 17:15.520
The ankle-deep puddle
of warm apple juice.

17:16.390 --> 17:18.924
Apple juice?

17:19.760 --> 17:22.426
Maybe, maybe not.

17:24.097 --> 17:27.933
I'm telling myself
a lot of things, Amy.

17:27.935 --> 17:31.636
What happened
to your other flip-flop?

17:31.638 --> 17:33.605
Oh, well, that involves

17:33.607 --> 17:38.577
what I am telling myself
was a... melted candy bar.

17:42.749 --> 17:44.916
Okay. I-I'm sorry.

17:44.918 --> 17:47.519
Is there anything
I can do to help?

17:47.521 --> 17:52.524
Yes. I want you to be
in charge of our wedding.

17:52.526 --> 17:54.426
Just you tell me
where and when,

17:54.428 --> 17:56.494
and I will show up
with a boutonniere

17:56.496 --> 17:58.864
and close-toed shoes and a...

17:58.866 --> 18:02.434
a Star Trek uniform
underneath my tuxedo.

18:04.204 --> 18:07.339
That last part is
non-negotiable.

18:07.341 --> 18:09.841
Are you sure
that's what you want?

18:09.843 --> 18:13.044
As sure as I'm about
to go bathe in Purell.

18:16.350 --> 18:18.583
I love you.
I love you, too.

18:19.887 --> 18:22.520
You know, ever since
I was a young girl,

18:22.522 --> 18:25.423
I-I've dreamed
of a June wedding,

18:25.425 --> 18:29.794
maybe on a cliff overlooking
the ocean at sunset.

18:31.265 --> 18:33.431
Sure.

18:35.669 --> 18:38.103
Sounds wonderful.

18:38.105 --> 18:42.007
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go clean up.

18:46.380 --> 18:48.914
Outdoor wedding.

18:48.916 --> 18:51.249
I know what
I'll be using that cliff for.

19:02.556 --> 19:05.891
I call this meeting of the
Council of Sheldons to order.

19:05.893 --> 19:08.293
Let's take roll.

19:08.295 --> 19:10.429
Science Sheldon?

19:10.431 --> 19:13.298
Present.

19:13.300 --> 19:14.900
Texas Sheldon?

19:14.902 --> 19:16.301
Howdy.

19:18.272 --> 19:20.239
Fanboy Sheldon?

19:20.241 --> 19:21.907
Greetings.

19:23.410 --> 19:25.377
Germaphobe
Sheldon?

19:25.379 --> 19:28.313
Say it, don't spray it.

19:30.484 --> 19:32.751
Where's Jock Sheldon?

19:34.121 --> 19:36.154
Not the time, Humorous Sheldon!

19:37.558 --> 19:40.092
Okay, new business.

19:40.094 --> 19:44.229
Do we grant Laid-Back Sheldon
a seat on the council?

19:44.231 --> 19:46.798
Hey, whatever
you guys want.

19:48.035 --> 19:52.437
I'm just chillin'
like Bob Dylan.

19:52.439 --> 19:54.473
- Negative.
- Heck, no!

19:54.475 --> 19:57.175
I don't feel well.

19:57.177 --> 19:58.844
(horn honks)

20:00.094 --> 20:01.960
Can we kick him out, too?
