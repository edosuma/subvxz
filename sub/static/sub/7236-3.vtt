<i>Beck begins a new training regimen
while Zed meets a new friend.</i>

00:13.275 --> 00:14.723
Wait! Don't.. leave.

00:15.357 --> 00:20.186
<i>At the Coliseum
Tessler provides Argon with entertainment.</i>

00:21.156 --> 00:23.666
<i>Beck is inspired to
volunteer for the games</i>

00:23.701 --> 00:26.058
<i>where he bonds
with a fellow teammate.</i>

00:26.093 --> 00:27.750
- Do you trust me?
- Do I have a choice?

00:28.005 --> 00:30.003
The winner of the next
round will be released.

00:30.020 --> 00:32.967
- Who are we fighting?
- Why, each other of course.

00:33.111 --> 00:34.667
And to the death.

00:35.391 --> 00:37.216
<i>Final round commencing.</i>

00:47.941 --> 00:51.217
<i>Match duration: To the death.</i>

00:51.437 --> 00:54.895
- They expect us to fight each other?
- Derezz each other.

00:54.930 --> 00:58.173
That crowd won't be satisfied
until one of us is in pieces.

01:04.248 --> 01:06.981
They can't make us do it.
Not if we stand together.

01:23.971 --> 01:25.625
<i>Energy wall engaged.</i>

01:26.360 --> 01:29.750
<i>When there's a winner
the walls will stop.</i>

01:30.314 --> 01:33.798
<i>If there's no winner
they don't stop.</i>

01:34.515 --> 01:37.147
<i>Fight or be crushed.</i>

01:37.307 --> 01:39.226
Oh, it can't end like this.

01:40.568 --> 01:44.092
- Cutler! You've got to fight me.
- What?

01:44.746 --> 01:47.659
One of us has to survive this
and it has to be you.

01:47.755 --> 01:50.067
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you see?

01:50.464 --> 01:54.215
If we both get derezzed there will
be no one left to continue the fight.

01:54.250 --> 01:57.363
They'll win.
We can't let that happen.

01:57.623 --> 01:59.078
So attack me!

01:59.310 --> 02:01.880
Are you crazy?
That's exactly what they want!

02:01.915 --> 02:04.937
Then let's give them what they want.
Now, come on!

02:05.866 --> 02:08.346
No. I won't fight you.

02:08.852 --> 02:11.718
Fine, then you'll die a coward.

02:19.551 --> 02:29.051
<b>S01E03 - Renegade, Part 2</b>

02:49.729 --> 02:51.144
Is that a best you can do?

03:16.166 --> 03:17.514
Finish him.

03:25.589 --> 03:26.974
I forfeit.

03:27.155 --> 03:29.781
<i>He wins! Let him go!</i>

03:31.248 --> 03:33.454
- Cutler...
- You're the better fighter.

03:33.455 --> 03:36.852
If we want to defeat Clu,
you are the right program to do it.

03:37.544 --> 03:38.938
Did he say he forfeits?

03:38.973 --> 03:41.213
- Yes sir.
- He can't do that.

03:41.248 --> 03:43.721
I think he just did, sir.

03:45.377 --> 03:46.782
No forfeits.

03:46.995 --> 03:51.834
<i>Players 3 and 5, please prepare
for immediate derezzolution.</i>

03:51.869 --> 03:54.545
<i>Let them go free.
Let them go free.</i>

03:55.050 --> 03:57.579
Do you think it's wise
to let them both perish?

03:57.614 --> 04:01.119
If they both wish to be derezzed,
I have no problem obliging them.

04:01.154 --> 04:04.601
No, but you did promise
the crowd freedom.

04:04.636 --> 04:07.809
- So?
- So, you've got an image to uphold...

04:08.185 --> 04:09.887
the benevolent leader.

04:10.622 --> 04:14.288
One should go free
but the other one...

04:16.882 --> 04:20.906
Programs of Argon,
both these enemies deserve to perish

04:21.596 --> 04:24.101
but we are not savages.

04:24.338 --> 04:26.665
I made a promise to you
and I intend to uphold it.

04:27.050 --> 04:29.575
Number 5, you will be
rewarded with your freedom,

04:29.610 --> 04:32.838
even though...
you clearly failed to earn it.

04:33.732 --> 04:36.850
As for number 3,
at the end of the next cycle,

04:36.885 --> 04:39.782
you will meet your end
at the Argon square

04:39.817 --> 04:44.983
where you will be derezzed bit by
excruciating bit.

04:45.427 --> 04:46.776
<i>Tessler! Tessler!</i>

04:48.077 --> 04:51.277
No program makes a mockery
of the games and lives.

04:59.745 --> 05:01.274
You're free to go.

05:04.930 --> 05:05.615
- Cutler!
- Stand down.

05:05.650 --> 05:07.412
Beck, promise me.

05:11.509 --> 05:14.118
<i>Find Tron! Join him!</i>

05:16.395 --> 05:17.786
<i>Don't stop fighting!</i>

05:23.753 --> 05:26.807
<i>We had a choice, me or Cutler.</i>

05:27.337 --> 05:29.385
I'm not sure we chose the right one.

05:30.327 --> 05:33.293
He's the real hero.
He could've made a difference.

05:33.519 --> 05:37.723
<i>You've managed to survive the games
and walk away with all your limbs intact.</i>

05:38.307 --> 05:40.001
<i>Seems like you did ok.</i>

05:40.243 --> 05:42.810
I let them take Cutler
away to be derezzed.

05:43.447 --> 05:45.832
I failed. Again.

05:52.535 --> 05:54.885
- Are you alright?
- I'll be fine.

05:55.527 --> 05:59.060
That healing chamber is the only
thing holding my scars at bay.

05:59.162 --> 06:01.554
But you have more pressing
matters to worry about.

06:02.603 --> 06:05.908
Now, your friend,
he's still alive, right?

06:05.943 --> 06:10.917
- Yeah, until next cycle.
- Then you haven't failed, yet.

06:12.204 --> 06:13.204
Right.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.985
Beck!
Oh, boy am I glad I found you.

06:26.020 --> 06:29.384
Look, I did something really stupid
and I could really use your help.

06:29.419 --> 06:30.626
Sorry, Zed. I gotta go.

06:31.172 --> 06:32.652
Did you ask Mara, maybe she can help.

06:33.208 --> 06:36.629
Kind of hoping to keep
her out of this one...

07:19.660 --> 07:22.991
I can't believe I let her...
Maybe there's a way to fix this.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.360
Who am I kidding. I'm finished!

07:25.964 --> 07:29.402
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Everything?

07:29.437 --> 07:31.933
Remember Pearl?
The girl from the club?

07:32.453 --> 07:35.251
- Big mistake. I kinda...
- Zed!

07:36.401 --> 07:37.795
Have you seen my baton?

07:37.830 --> 07:40.263
Which baton?
You've got a million batons.

07:40.807 --> 07:42.105
The baton?

07:42.699 --> 07:46.232
You know. The Encom 786.

07:46.267 --> 07:49.304
Funny story about that.
Ohh, you should sit down.

07:49.638 --> 07:52.549
- You see, I...
- Oh, I totally forgot, we're late!

07:52.584 --> 07:55.734
- For what?
- You know, um... the thing?

07:55.769 --> 07:56.769
Bye!

07:58.891 --> 07:59.844
What are you doing?

07:59.856 --> 08:02.292
I'm helping you to get
that bike back from Pearl.

08:02.327 --> 08:06.020
- Wow, that obvious?
- Even from across the club.

08:06.303 --> 08:09.667
- We'll never find her.
- Maybe not, but we can find the bike.

08:09.846 --> 08:10.999
Come on.

08:34.437 --> 08:35.437
Hey!

08:40.368 --> 08:43.126
Tron, is it really you?

08:43.162 --> 08:45.437
Let's get you out of here.

08:54.220 --> 08:56.738
Why is that ship going
the wrong way?

08:57.718 --> 09:00.066
Does anyone else notice
our prisoner escaping?

09:00.235 --> 09:01.995
Shoot it down!

09:04.400 --> 09:06.108
<i>Lock on the target.</i>

09:06.892 --> 09:07.934
<i>Target engaged.</i>

09:18.855 --> 09:20.967
- We're too low!
- I got it.

09:51.362 --> 09:53.087
How could you let this happen?

09:53.122 --> 09:55.289
Let what happen, Pavel?

09:56.610 --> 09:58.739
We have a small problem, sir.

10:01.315 --> 10:04.787
Looks like I have to
clean up your mess. Again.

10:15.352 --> 10:18.356
- You again.
- Expecting someone else?

10:18.721 --> 10:19.945
Love the new look.

10:24.005 --> 10:27.115
You weren't exactly programmed
for fighting, were you?

10:27.150 --> 10:28.150
No.

10:30.428 --> 10:31.783
Aerodynamics.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.980
- This is all you brought me?
- This is 786.

10:57.015 --> 10:59.891
- It's one of a kind.
- It's kind of a piece of junk.

11:00.161 --> 11:03.208
Do you know, how valuable it is?
Kevin Flynn rode one just like it.

11:03.243 --> 11:06.138
Didn't you hear me?
It's not worth anything.

11:07.181 --> 11:09.460
But... since it's worthless.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.110
It's official.
Abel's going to kill me.

11:30.401 --> 11:33.302
- Any ideas?
- They have us outnumbered...

11:33.458 --> 11:36.124
but if we take them by surprise...

11:38.525 --> 11:39.665
Surprise!

11:44.457 --> 11:49.165
<i>Expect minor delay.
Your patience is appreciated.</i>

11:52.151 --> 11:55.433
- The whole city's on alert.
- Then we get you out of the city.

11:55.468 --> 12:00.037
<i>Expect minor delay.
Your patience is appreciated.</i>

12:00.072 --> 12:01.072
Go!

12:04.433 --> 12:05.740
Stop, program!

12:16.466 --> 12:17.817
We have to jump.

12:17.852 --> 12:19.331
- What?
- Don't hesitate.

12:19.423 --> 12:20.522
Trust me.

12:24.157 --> 12:25.157
Come on.

12:28.860 --> 12:32.039
Where are you going?
The revolution needs you.

12:38.407 --> 12:39.497
Let's go.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.230
What are you doing here?

12:49.576 --> 12:52.271
Um... Just returning your bike.

12:52.644 --> 12:53.582
Good as new.

12:53.617 --> 12:55.854
- You let him follow you here?
- He's nobody.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.407
Just an easy mark.

12:58.007 --> 13:01.090
- Why did you do this?
- Because it was fun.

13:01.245 --> 13:03.202
Watching you sulk at the club.

13:03.237 --> 13:07.504
Staring at the girls on the
dancefloor you seemed so...

13:07.539 --> 13:10.484
- What's the word?
- Desperate? Gullible?

13:11.025 --> 13:12.734
Pathetic.

13:14.260 --> 13:18.034
As if any girl in her
right mind would ever

13:18.035 --> 13:21.809
be attracted to such a weak, hopeless...

13:23.195 --> 13:25.368
That's my friend, you're talking to.

13:25.749 --> 13:26.749
Grab it!

13:30.299 --> 13:32.272
What are you waiting for?
Get them!

13:45.332 --> 13:47.278
Those boats should get
us out of the city.

14:07.408 --> 14:09.452
End of the line, programs.

14:44.072 --> 14:47.940
You gonna to wear yourself out.
Just tell Tessler you've lost us.

14:52.793 --> 14:54.659
That's... yeah.

15:26.172 --> 15:28.277
Zed, they're gaining on us.

15:30.316 --> 15:31.529
Embrace yourself.

15:31.823 --> 15:35.644
What are you doing?
They'll be on top of us any second.

15:35.713 --> 15:37.694
Trust me, ok?

15:41.330 --> 15:43.751
Like I said, pathetic.

15:43.786 --> 15:47.204
- I'm gonna enjoy this.
- Not nearly as much as I am.

16:15.749 --> 16:17.740
That was amazing.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.797
Get off me before I kill...

16:30.086 --> 16:33.576
Trust me, you really don't
want to finish that sentence.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.669
<i>Aircraft detected.</i>

16:55.413 --> 16:57.858
Nowhere to run this time, renegade.

17:07.603 --> 17:10.424
I really thought it was all over back then.

17:12.473 --> 17:13.762
It's not over yet.

17:37.438 --> 17:39.257
I think we've got a problem.

17:53.250 --> 17:56.310
Permission to board, renegade!

18:17.168 --> 18:18.512
We're not gonna make it.

18:20.183 --> 18:21.470
Come on.

18:26.965 --> 18:28.875
Bring all weapons to bear!

18:59.838 --> 19:02.995
- Who was that?
- A friend.

19:03.876 --> 19:07.086
Help me! Help me!

19:16.485 --> 19:19.475
You better get moving.
There'll be more patrols.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.180
There's a program named Beck...

19:22.391 --> 19:24.271
if it weren't him,
I wouldn't be here right now.

19:24.586 --> 19:26.750
That's funny. I met him.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.676
He said the same thing about you

19:29.787 --> 19:31.402
and he told me to give you this.

19:33.794 --> 19:36.692
- How do I thank you?
- I need recruits.

19:37.441 --> 19:39.895
- Will you spread the word?
- Count on it.

19:39.930 --> 19:43.721
The uprising will spread throughout the
Grid when other programs learn the truth.

19:43.994 --> 19:45.690
Tron lives!

19:53.418 --> 19:56.664
I should've known better,
I don't deserve program like Pearl.

19:57.422 --> 19:59.488
I mean, look at her
and then look at me.

19:59.860 --> 20:02.554
Focus Zed,
Able will be here any moment.

20:02.948 --> 20:05.074
Able?
I just saw him in the break room.

20:05.740 --> 20:08.279
- What happened?
- We're dead. We're dead!

20:08.314 --> 20:10.234
Well, it was nice knowing you all.

20:12.551 --> 20:15.618
You two distract Abel.
Let me take a crack on this.

20:16.148 --> 20:19.226
Thanks, Beck. Come on, hurry!

20:20.550 --> 20:25.236
So, the third siren says
"I thought that disk looked..."

20:25.271 --> 20:26.551
...you've heard this one before?

20:26.575 --> 20:31.785
Zed, I'm the one who told it to you.
Now, where's my 786?

20:31.987 --> 20:33.820
Well, you see, it's...

20:34.103 --> 20:37.144
All tuned up, just like you wanted.

20:40.067 --> 20:42.083
Great job, Beck.

20:42.118 --> 20:45.371
Actually, Beck's not the
only one who deserves credit.

20:46.553 --> 20:50.701
Zed does, too. And he deserves
the whole lot more than that.

20:50.884 --> 20:53.317
I do? I do!

20:55.012 --> 20:59.084
Beck helped but
I did all the heavylifting.

21:07.617 --> 21:11.954
So are you here to continue the fight?
Or to quit?

21:13.068 --> 21:16.583
I know there are going to be setbacks
as well as victories.

21:17.140 --> 21:19.215
<i>But I guess that's ok...</i>

21:19.250 --> 21:21.421
<i>as long as we keep fighting...</i>

21:21.583 --> 21:23.246
<i>and never lose hope.</i>

21:25.483 --> 21:27.424
So, now what?

21:28.419 --> 21:32.108
You keep training.
Like I said...

21:32.109 --> 21:34.153
you've got a lot to learn.
