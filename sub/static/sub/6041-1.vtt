I'm not leaving you.

17:44.813 --> 17:48.983
OFFICIAL 1: We have 47 cases
and eight deaths as of 5 this afternoon.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.652
It's a weekend.
These numbers might be low.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.864
People are staying home for a couple days,
see if they get better.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.909
At this point, I think
we have to believe this is respiratory.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.828
- Maybe fomites too.
- What's that, fomites?

18:00.996 --> 18:04.207
Uh, it refers to transmission
from surfaces.

18:04.374 --> 18:07.794
The average person touches their face
2- or 3000 times a day.

18:07.961 --> 18:13.216
- Two- or 3000 times a day?
- Three to five times every waking minute.

18:13.383 --> 18:16.344
In between, we're touching doorknobs...

18:16.512 --> 18:19.222
...water fountains,
elevator buttons and each other.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.808
Those things become fomites.

18:21.975 --> 18:25.353
Is this something we wanna release
to the press? Respiratory and fomites?

18:25.521 --> 18:29.190
- How's the public gonna react?
- Hard to say. A plastic shark in a movie...

18:29.358 --> 18:32.860
...will keep people from getting in the
ocean, but a warning on cigarettes...

18:33.028 --> 18:36.531
We need to walk the governor through this
before we freak everybody out.

18:36.698 --> 18:40.910
I mean, heh, we can't even tell people
right now what they should be afraid of.

18:41.078 --> 18:44.205
We tried that with swine flu.
All we did was get healthy people scared.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.165
It's the biggest shopping weekend
of the year.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.126
OFFICIAL 2:
We need to consider closing schools.

18:48.293 --> 18:51.546
And who stays home with the kids?
People that work at stores.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.965
Government workers.
People that work at hospitals.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.677
When will we know what this is?
What causes it, what cures it?

18:57.845 --> 19:00.138
Things that keep people calm.

19:00.305 --> 19:04.976
What we need to determine is this:

19:05.144 --> 19:07.895
For every person who gets sick...

19:08.063 --> 19:11.649
...how many other people
are they likely to infect?

19:12.276 --> 19:15.486
So for seasonal flu,
that's usually about one.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.240
Smallpox, on the other hand,
it's over three.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.867
Now, before we had a vaccine...

19:21.034 --> 19:25.371
...polio spread at a rate
between four and six.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.583
Now, we call that number...

19:29.293 --> 19:30.960
...the R-nought.

19:31.128 --> 19:35.965
R stands for the reproductive rate
of the virus.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.426
Any ideas what that might be for this?

19:38.594 --> 19:42.763
How fast it multiplies depends
on a variety of factors.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.766
The incubation period,
how long a person is contagious.

19:45.934 --> 19:49.187
Sometimes people can be contagious
without even having symptoms.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.022
We need to know that too.

19:51.190 --> 19:55.359
We need to know how big the population of
people susceptible to the virus might be.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.613
So far that appears to be everyone
with hands, a mouth and a nose.

19:58.780 --> 20:02.783
Once we know the R-nought, we'll be able to
get a handle on the scale of the epidemic.

20:02.951 --> 20:05.786
So it's an epidemic now.
An epidemic of what?

20:05.954 --> 20:07.747
We sent samples to the CDC.

20:08.248 --> 20:13.294
In 72 hours, we'll know what it is,
if we're lucky.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.296
Clearly, we're not lucky.
