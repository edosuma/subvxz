00:00.633 --> 00:01.900
Hi. Joshua Gomez.

00:01.968 --> 00:03.135
Welcome to <i>Chuck.</i>

00:03.203 --> 00:04.436
Do me a favor.

00:04.504 --> 00:08.407
Put on your 3-D glasses
right now.

00:09.776 --> 00:11.477
Wow! That's cool.

00:11.544 --> 00:13.612
That is pretty amazing stuff.

00:17.517 --> 00:20.719
Chuck.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.056
Chuck.

00:25.725 --> 00:28.627
Chuck, wake up.

00:30.163 --> 00:31.663
Sarah, what are...?

00:33.166 --> 00:34.007
What are you
doing here?

00:34.167 --> 00:35.934
Oh.

00:36.002 --> 00:37.603
Okay, uh, Sarah?

00:37.670 --> 00:39.338
Yes, Chuck?

00:39.406 --> 00:40.372
This is a dream.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.840
No, it isn't.

00:41.908 --> 00:42.975
Come on. Who are we...

00:43.043 --> 00:44.043
Who are we kidding here, huh?

00:44.110 --> 00:45.911
This is...

00:45.979 --> 00:48.180
This is clearly
my-my subconscious at work.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.082
And on behalf
of my conscious self,

00:50.150 --> 00:52.718
I'd-I'd like
to apologize.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.353
I'm normally
much more respectful of women

00:54.421 --> 00:55.587
even in my dreams.

00:55.655 --> 00:56.989
It's just that,

00:57.057 --> 00:59.158
you know, anxiety and fear
can-can really, um...

00:59.225 --> 01:00.826
...affect your dream life.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.494
And what are you afraid of?

01:04.464 --> 01:07.099
I watched you kill that
FULCRUM agent in cold blood.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.168
Sarah, I am...
I am not like you, okay?

01:09.235 --> 01:10.903
I might have all these
government secrets in my brain,

01:10.970 --> 01:12.404
but that does not make me
a real spy.

01:12.472 --> 01:14.306
I need to tell you this
in reality, not in my dream.

01:14.374 --> 01:15.607
Chuck.

01:15.675 --> 01:17.109
Hey.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.144
This isn't a dream.

01:19.212 --> 01:20.746
Oh, what is it?

01:20.814 --> 01:22.114
It's a nightmare.

01:34.627 --> 01:36.995
That's not the way
that dream was supposed to go.

01:41.701 --> 01:43.836
Chuck, are you okay?

01:43.903 --> 01:44.970
I'm fine.

01:45.038 --> 01:48.974
I'm absolutely 100% on it. Why?

01:49.042 --> 01:51.043
Dude, you were totally
screaming last night.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.611
Like a little girl.
- Honey.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.413
It was crazy
how high it was.

01:54.481 --> 01:58.117
I'm sorry about that,
but, yeah, I'm fe.

01:58.184 --> 02:00.519
Bro, you're a tense coil
of stressed-out negativity.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.154
We don't mean
to pry, but...

02:02.222 --> 02:03.489
Actually, we do. We do.

02:03.556 --> 02:05.090
What's stressing you out?

02:05.158 --> 02:07.659
Nothing... particular.

02:07.727 --> 02:10.362
You know, it's a little hectic
at work and stuff.

02:10.430 --> 02:13.165
Wow. I didn't realize life got
so hectic at the Buy More.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.100
Well, Chuck,

02:15.168 --> 02:16.602
maybe what you need
is a day off.

02:16.669 --> 02:18.070
Good prescription, babe.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.771
Chuck, that's exactly
what you need.

02:19.839 --> 02:22.774
You need to blow off some
steam, have some fun.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.576
Take a day
off, Chuck.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.790
Dude, we got the day off.

02:38.858 --> 02:41.960
What? What? What is...
What is going on?

02:42.028 --> 02:44.530
Tyler Martin is coming here.

02:44.597 --> 02:46.265
Tyler Martin?
<i>The</i> Tyler Martin?

02:46.332 --> 02:47.466
Rock star Tyler Martin?

02:47.534 --> 02:49.368
Rock star, legend, poet.

02:49.435 --> 02:51.203
I've never actually heard him,
but apparently,

02:51.271 --> 02:52.704
he had this huge promotion
over at Large Mart,

02:52.772 --> 02:54.773
and they pulled the plug because
of the whole sex tape thing.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.041
Oh.
- Yeah. Have you seen it?

02:56.109 --> 02:57.442
No.
- Well, anyway,

02:57.510 --> 02:59.244
Big Mike heard about it,
and offered them our store.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.146
Thank you, Big Mike.

03:01.214 --> 03:02.614
That's what I'm saying.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.716
Dude, this place is gonna
be so packed to the gills,

03:04.784 --> 03:06.685
no one's even gonna notice
that we're doing diddly squat.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.488
Grimes! Over here now!

03:09.556 --> 03:11.123
Have fun.

03:16.763 --> 03:20.232
Grimes, got a job for you.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.633
Old football buddy of mine,

03:21.701 --> 03:23.001
Jimmy Butterman,
just got paroled.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.336
I told his PO

03:24.404 --> 03:25.604
that we'd give him a job here

03:25.672 --> 03:27.039
at Buy More so he could get back
on his feet.

03:27.106 --> 03:28.907
An ex-con, sir?

03:28.975 --> 03:30.108
I-I just...

03:30.176 --> 03:31.243
Is that such a good idea?

03:31.311 --> 03:32.744
He's a teammate, Grimes.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.446
Teach him everything
you know.

03:34.514 --> 03:35.847
I will.

03:35.915 --> 03:36.982
When you say prison,

03:37.050 --> 03:38.717
though, are you
talking, like, bars

03:38.785 --> 03:41.186
and-and guards and, uh, showers?

03:41.254 --> 03:42.020
Get out!

03:42.088 --> 03:43.155
Get out. Getting... Okay.

03:47.293 --> 03:49.294
Attention.

03:49.362 --> 03:51.029
Attention!

03:52.298 --> 03:54.166
Oh, thank you.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.601
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:55.668 --> 03:58.170
when my personal friend,
Mr. Martin,

03:58.238 --> 04:00.539
enters the store,
there is to be

04:00.607 --> 04:01.940
no flash photography...

04:02.008 --> 04:04.610
Oh!

04:04.677 --> 04:06.812
...no approaching of Mr. Martin
of any kind,

04:06.879 --> 04:10.048
and most importantly,
no touching!

04:10.116 --> 04:11.984
Consider yourself warned.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.673
Ooh! Sarah, Casey,

04:34.741 --> 04:36.108
there's a situation
in the Buy More.

04:36.175 --> 04:37.809
There is a guy with a grenade.

04:37.877 --> 04:39.111
I'm heading
toward the store now.

04:39.178 --> 04:41.013
Where is he?

04:44.684 --> 04:45.817
He's gone.

04:45.885 --> 04:47.486
Where is the grenade?

04:47.553 --> 04:49.121
Go!

04:49.188 --> 04:50.789
Oh.

04:52.425 --> 04:53.859
Don't open it!

04:53.926 --> 04:56.094
It's a grenade.
- Okay.

04:56.162 --> 04:57.729
It's gonna blow anyway, idiot.
I'll take it out front.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.464
No, we can't take it out front.
There's people out there.

04:59.532 --> 05:01.333
We got to take it out the back.
Oh. You stay here.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.367
Casey!

05:03.803 --> 05:05.037
Hey, that's my
Tyler Martin display.

05:05.104 --> 05:06.271
He is a hero
of mine, Chuck.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.573
Sorry, Lester.
Emergency.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.475
Nobody treats
Lester like that.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.577
Jeff, let go!

05:14.580 --> 05:15.580
Throw it.

05:17.617 --> 05:18.717
Chuck!

05:24.090 --> 05:26.058
Interception!

05:26.125 --> 05:28.727
Why are we playing keep away?

05:28.795 --> 05:30.829
Oh!

05:45.378 --> 05:47.312
Come on...

05:47.380 --> 05:48.847
Oh, Grimes.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.415
See you've met Mr. Butterman.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.251
The other half
of the Defense of Death.

05:53.319 --> 05:54.319
Blow it up!
- Blow it up!

05:54.387 --> 05:55.454
What did we win?

05:57.423 --> 05:58.757
Good morning, Sarah.

05:58.825 --> 05:59.725
No time to diffuse it.

05:59.792 --> 06:02.060
I got an idea.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.829
Here.

06:03.896 --> 06:05.664
Hold on. Open the door.

06:10.603 --> 06:11.937
Get down!

06:12.004 --> 06:13.572
Oh!

06:13.639 --> 06:15.307
Oh!

06:15.375 --> 06:19.911
Oh. Good
morning, Chuck.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.864
# Na-na na-na na-na #

06:38.931 --> 06:41.767
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

06:41.834 --> 06:43.402
# Na-na na-na na-na #

06:43.469 --> 06:45.070
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

06:45.138 --> 06:46.638
# Na-na na-na na-na #

06:46.706 --> 06:49.908
# Na-na na-na
na-na. #

07:03.889 --> 07:05.756
Agent Walker, Mr. Bartowski.

07:05.824 --> 07:06.957
I'm sure you're wondering

07:07.025 --> 07:09.193
why would someone want
Tyler Martin dead.

07:09.261 --> 07:10.561
Not really. I mean,
have you heard his music?

07:10.629 --> 07:12.163
It's overly produced, the lyrics

07:12.230 --> 07:13.931
are completely banal.

07:13.999 --> 07:15.733
I mean, Facebook even
has a group called

07:15.801 --> 07:18.069
I Want To Kill Tyler Martin.

07:18.136 --> 07:19.003
Not that I'm a member.

07:19.071 --> 07:19.937
I wouldn't ever...

07:20.005 --> 07:20.938
That's just wrong.

07:21.006 --> 07:22.073
Why don't you just share

07:22.140 --> 07:23.374
with General Beckman the intel

07:23.442 --> 07:24.508
about the grenade
that you flashed on?

07:24.576 --> 07:26.110
It was an IG-88
thermite charge.

07:26.178 --> 07:28.346
That's military.

07:28.413 --> 07:30.648
Commonly used by North African
intelligence units.

07:30.716 --> 07:32.049
Interestingly,
Tyler Martin recently

07:32.117 --> 07:33.084
completed a tour of Africa.

07:33.151 --> 07:34.452
I want you to find out

07:34.519 --> 07:36.120
who was behind this attempt
and why.

07:36.188 --> 07:38.889
Well, the only way to do that
is to question Tyler Martin.

07:38.957 --> 07:40.191
Then bring him in.

07:40.258 --> 07:42.226
It can't be that hard
to get him alone.

07:58.877 --> 08:00.244
All right.

08:00.312 --> 08:01.212
Hello, Cleveland!

08:02.781 --> 08:04.048
Yeah.

08:04.116 --> 08:05.516
This is Burbank.

08:05.584 --> 08:06.717
Oh.

08:06.785 --> 08:08.686
Whatever.

08:08.754 --> 08:10.087
Now, I would
like to thank

08:10.155 --> 08:11.622
all of the humanitarians

08:11.690 --> 08:13.324
that have affected
my work.

08:13.392 --> 08:16.660
Mother Theresa, Nelson Mandela,
God rest his soul.

08:16.728 --> 08:18.529
And my personal favorite,

08:18.597 --> 08:20.064
Angelina Jolie.

08:21.299 --> 08:23.300
As a thank you
to all my beautiful fans

08:23.368 --> 08:27.037
who still buy CDs,
I've included this,

08:27.105 --> 08:28.906
a ticket, a golden ticket...

08:28.974 --> 08:30.274
A golden ticket?

08:30.342 --> 08:31.942
Golden ticket!
...inside these.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.410
My new CD.

08:33.477 --> 08:35.846
It is a backstage invite

08:35.914 --> 08:38.015
to a benefit concert
I'm having tomorrow night.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.217
All right, we'll see you later.

08:40.284 --> 08:41.452
That was great, Tyler.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.720
Yeah.

08:42.788 --> 08:43.953
This is gonna be huge

08:44.022 --> 08:45.356
for the Tyler Martin brand,
you realize that?

08:45.424 --> 08:46.657
How are we supposed

08:46.725 --> 08:48.192
to grab a rock star
in broad daylight?

08:48.260 --> 08:49.727
I mean, security's crawling
all over the place.

08:49.795 --> 08:51.128
Oh.

09:00.672 --> 09:02.606
This is going to be easy.

09:02.674 --> 09:04.308
What...?

09:04.376 --> 09:06.177
Catch you later, Gavin.

09:06.244 --> 09:07.645
What's gonna be easy?

09:11.817 --> 09:13.250
I'm such a fan, Mr. Martin.

09:13.318 --> 09:14.585
Oh.

09:14.653 --> 09:16.287
I'm a big fan
of yours, too.

09:16.354 --> 09:18.589
So, are you, uh, a

09:18.657 --> 09:21.158
model, actress?

09:22.394 --> 09:23.461
Massage therapist?

09:23.528 --> 09:25.162
Maybe a

09:25.230 --> 09:26.297
acrobat?

09:27.632 --> 09:29.166
I can be whatever you want.

09:29.234 --> 09:30.034
Ugh!

09:31.303 --> 09:32.169
Idiot.

09:34.706 --> 09:36.340
I think we got a pervert.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.443
Oh, daisies.

09:39.511 --> 09:40.678
Oh.

09:41.713 --> 09:43.013
Nighty-night, Tyler.

09:46.051 --> 09:48.252
How much tranquilizer
did you use?

09:48.320 --> 09:50.387
It's a high grade at a heavy dose.

09:50.455 --> 09:52.623
Mr. Martin should be out
for 12 to 24 hours.

09:55.627 --> 09:57.061
Jet lag is brutal.

09:57.128 --> 09:58.796
Rock star
metabolism.

09:58.864 --> 10:01.432
Oh. All the better
for seeing you, darling,

10:01.500 --> 10:02.666
you know.

10:04.002 --> 10:06.003
Oh. I feel like a daffodil.

10:06.071 --> 10:07.271
Time for the road trip.

10:07.339 --> 10:08.973
Road trip? Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.608
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

10:10.675 --> 10:13.377
The Buy More parking lot camera
has a match on the car

10:13.445 --> 10:15.045
the suspect drove this morning.
- What about Tyler here?

10:15.113 --> 10:16.447
Hmm?

10:16.515 --> 10:18.282
Oh, check his mouth
every 20 minutes,

10:18.350 --> 10:20.050
make sure he doesn't
choke on his own tongue.

10:20.118 --> 10:21.886
Hang on a second.
You're-you're gonna go,

10:21.953 --> 10:23.153
and you want
me to stay here

10:23.221 --> 10:24.889
and be on tongue watch duty?

10:24.956 --> 10:27.525
Well, you don't
have plans, do you?

10:27.592 --> 10:29.627
Would it be so crazy
if I did have plans?

10:29.694 --> 10:31.762
Plans that involved something
other than fixing a computer

10:31.830 --> 10:33.664
or playing hot potato
with a thermite grenade?

10:33.732 --> 10:35.566
Yes.

10:42.541 --> 10:43.941
<i>So, what's with Chuck?</i>

10:44.009 --> 10:45.743
<i>The guy's got a point.</i>

10:45.810 --> 10:46.977
He hasn't
had a day off.

10:47.045 --> 10:48.212
If you ask me,
we're lucky

10:48.280 --> 10:49.446
he didn't melt down
months ago.

10:49.514 --> 10:50.714
No, I think it's
something else.

10:50.782 --> 10:51.982
He's been acting strange
since the holidays.

10:52.050 --> 10:52.917
Hold that thought.

11:06.097 --> 11:08.132
We got a real fan boy, huh?

11:08.199 --> 11:09.767
No, no, there's
something wrong here.

11:09.834 --> 11:10.768
This is too neat.

11:10.835 --> 11:11.802
It's too orderly.

11:11.870 --> 11:12.903
Beckman was right.

11:12.971 --> 11:13.871
We're dealing
with a pro.

11:15.874 --> 11:17.708
<i>Golden ticket's got</i>
<i>to be in here somewhere.</i>

11:17.776 --> 11:19.143
I don't know, guys.

11:19.210 --> 11:21.111
I mean, you think
this is right?

11:21.179 --> 11:22.379
This golden ticket's

11:22.447 --> 11:24.014
supposed to be for
Tyler Martin fans.

11:24.082 --> 11:26.050
Hey, I am a fan.
- So am I.

11:26.117 --> 11:27.751
Yeah, so am I.

11:31.423 --> 11:33.424
So, Mr. Butterman,
could you settle a bet?

11:33.491 --> 11:35.793
Say it's our first
day in prison.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.127
Who do you think
would be considered

11:37.195 --> 11:38.095
the weaker gazelle?

11:40.599 --> 11:42.399
You put anything
in my mouth...

11:42.467 --> 11:43.867
I will bite down hard.

11:47.539 --> 11:49.173
That's it.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.407
The golden ticket!

11:50.475 --> 11:52.543
Oh, my God, Morgan!
- Please, please.

11:52.611 --> 11:54.645
I am so happy for us, buddy.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.447
Please, please.
- You don't want me to hurt them.

11:56.514 --> 11:59.016
Fellas... please.

12:01.286 --> 12:03.787
This ticket only entitles me
to a plus one,

12:03.855 --> 12:05.990
okay, so we are gonna
have to settle this...

12:06.057 --> 12:07.858
the Buy More way.

12:09.127 --> 12:10.527
This ticket is Lester's...

12:10.595 --> 12:12.162
and... and Butterman's.

12:33.985 --> 12:35.185
What?!

12:39.057 --> 12:40.290
No, hey, hey, excuse me.

12:40.358 --> 12:42.693
This may be the most
impressive restroom

12:42.761 --> 12:44.161
I've ever seen
in my life.

12:44.229 --> 12:47.498
That ceiling looks just
like the night sky.

12:47.565 --> 12:49.366
That's because that
<i>is</i> the night sky.

12:49.434 --> 12:50.768
Oh.

12:52.437 --> 12:54.972
Have I made a mistake?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.206
No.

12:56.274 --> 12:58.042
Better question.

12:58.109 --> 12:59.743
Where am I?

12:59.811 --> 13:00.844
Who are you?

13:00.912 --> 13:02.579
I'm Chuck, my name is Chuck.

13:02.647 --> 13:04.148
And I...

13:04.215 --> 13:05.516
I work for the label.

13:05.583 --> 13:06.517
My record label?

13:06.584 --> 13:07.851
Yes, yes, your record label.

13:07.919 --> 13:09.019
There was a
death threat

13:09.087 --> 13:10.254
against you
earlier today,

13:10.321 --> 13:12.189
so we thought it might
be good to move you

13:12.257 --> 13:13.490
to this
secure location.

13:13.558 --> 13:14.725
All right, well...

13:15.760 --> 13:16.860
I'd better go.

13:16.928 --> 13:18.228
Um, um, Mr. Martin,

13:18.296 --> 13:21.765
you actually have
to stay here for the night.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.801
The night? No, no, no, Jack.

13:23.868 --> 13:25.602
Chuck, actually.
I get death threats

13:25.670 --> 13:26.770
all the time, okay?

13:26.838 --> 13:28.172
Besides...

13:28.239 --> 13:29.540
it's party night.

13:29.607 --> 13:30.607
It's Tuesday.

13:30.675 --> 13:31.875
Exactly.

13:31.943 --> 13:33.110
I've got to go.

13:33.178 --> 13:34.244
Um, you know what?

13:34.312 --> 13:35.579
Hey, hey, how about...

13:35.647 --> 13:37.181
I'm just gonna call
my bosses real quick.

13:37.248 --> 13:39.083
Chuck, the record company
got you this phone, right?

13:39.150 --> 13:40.217
Sure.

13:40.285 --> 13:41.919
Hmm... okay.

13:41.986 --> 13:43.487
Why...

13:43.555 --> 13:45.089
I'll get you a new one.

13:49.494 --> 13:50.894
Chuck...

13:50.962 --> 13:54.565
in case you haven't
noticed yet,

13:54.632 --> 13:56.934
I just asked you
to party...

13:57.001 --> 13:58.736
with me.

14:04.476 --> 14:05.709
Come on.

14:05.777 --> 14:07.444
Come on.

14:08.947 --> 14:09.880
Yeah.

14:09.948 --> 14:10.881
What a night.

14:10.949 --> 14:11.949
You got money, right?

14:12.016 --> 14:12.850
'Cause I don't
hold cash.

14:20.206 --> 14:21.740
First, a little
liquid nourishment.

14:21.808 --> 14:23.542
Then, we'll get on
to the heavy drinking.

14:23.610 --> 14:25.811
Oh, um, you know, I'm actually
more of a beer guy.

14:25.879 --> 14:27.045
Something amber
complected?

14:27.113 --> 14:28.146
Not tonight, Chuck.

14:28.214 --> 14:30.716
I may be a rum-soaked
narcissist,

14:30.783 --> 14:32.718
but I am also
the best wingman

14:32.785 --> 14:33.819
you will ever have.

14:33.887 --> 14:34.887
Drink it down, mate.

14:39.092 --> 14:40.492
See you guys in the
emergency room!

14:44.731 --> 14:46.498
Hello.

14:46.566 --> 14:48.667
Gavin, you old slapper.

14:48.735 --> 14:51.770
No, I'm with the rep
from the label.

14:51.838 --> 14:53.472
Chuck!

14:53.539 --> 14:54.673
Never heard of you.

14:54.741 --> 14:56.475
I've never heard of <i>him.</i>

14:56.542 --> 14:58.143
He's never heard of you!

14:58.211 --> 14:59.711
No, never mind.

14:59.779 --> 15:00.779
See you later.

15:00.847 --> 15:01.880
Who's for
another drink?

15:07.487 --> 15:09.621
Ladies, tonight,
all the drinks...

15:09.689 --> 15:11.623
on the record company.
- Oh!

15:17.030 --> 15:18.563
To determine who will
be the plus one

15:18.631 --> 15:19.831
of my golden ticket,

15:19.899 --> 15:20.866
we will settle this

15:20.934 --> 15:24.169
with Morgan's special triathlon.

15:24.237 --> 15:25.237
First up...

15:25.305 --> 15:26.805
the Molly Ringwald

15:26.873 --> 15:28.106
underpants challenge.

15:28.174 --> 15:30.342
The first of you
to present to me

15:30.410 --> 15:31.543
women's underpants

15:31.611 --> 15:32.577
is going to...

15:43.189 --> 15:44.122
I'm a man.

15:44.190 --> 15:45.257
For God's sake,

15:45.325 --> 15:46.291
I'm a man!

15:46.359 --> 15:47.693
Oh.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.061
I'm actually going
to accept these.

15:49.128 --> 15:51.630
You know, a ticket's not
that important to me.

15:51.698 --> 15:52.864
I need some ice.

15:55.902 --> 15:57.302
Look, if you're worried
about Chuck,

15:57.370 --> 15:59.271
I can talk to him,
scare him straight.

15:59.339 --> 16:00.372
I'd actually
enjoy that.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.606
Uh, no, it's okay.

16:01.674 --> 16:03.008
I'll get him
under control.

16:10.650 --> 16:11.817
Too late.

16:11.884 --> 16:13.185
<i>So I said, "I'll give you</i>

16:13.252 --> 16:14.820
the dog
for the trousers."

16:14.887 --> 16:16.154
That's how I got
the trousers.

16:18.324 --> 16:19.358
Hey, Chuck.

16:19.425 --> 16:21.326
I'll tell you
what you need.

16:21.394 --> 16:22.361
Aspirin!

16:22.428 --> 16:23.895
A tattoo.

16:23.963 --> 16:24.930
Oh, no, no, no!

16:24.998 --> 16:26.064
I'm not crazy about needles.

16:26.132 --> 16:28.867
Ladies love a little bit of ink.

16:28.935 --> 16:30.802
Whenever I do something
amazing, you know,

16:30.870 --> 16:32.104
feed the starving,

16:32.171 --> 16:33.739
help the homeless,

16:33.806 --> 16:36.041
rescue some
emaciated refugee,

16:36.109 --> 16:37.376
I map it out

16:37.443 --> 16:39.077
here on my body.

16:39.145 --> 16:40.479
How do you know
what they all mean?

16:40.546 --> 16:43.682
Well, this here means...

16:43.750 --> 16:45.417
serenity.

16:45.485 --> 16:46.518
It's not...

16:46.586 --> 16:47.619
it could be bliss.

16:47.687 --> 16:48.820
I don't know--
Gavin,

16:48.888 --> 16:50.188
my manager, sorts it all out.

16:50.256 --> 16:52.391
You know, you got to kind
of trust the artist.

16:54.794 --> 16:55.660
Are you
Tyler Martin?

16:55.728 --> 16:56.862
Yes, I am.

16:58.398 --> 17:00.165
And this here is Chuck.

17:01.534 --> 17:02.434
Chuck is in my band.

17:04.704 --> 17:06.137
Yeah...

17:06.204 --> 17:08.306
yeah, I'm in his band all right.

17:08.374 --> 17:10.075
Drummer-- just laying
the beats down.

17:10.143 --> 17:11.576
Like a little drummer boy.

17:11.644 --> 17:13.178
Come, they told me.

17:13.246 --> 17:14.479
Pa-rump-a-pum-pum.

17:14.547 --> 17:15.646
Um...

17:15.714 --> 17:17.115
you guys want to dance?

17:17.183 --> 17:17.900
Yes.
- No.

17:17.901 --> 17:18.617
Yes, we do.

17:18.684 --> 17:21.353
No, I'm not really
a dancer, you know?

17:21.421 --> 17:22.921
Unless it's, like,
some ballet or...

17:22.989 --> 17:24.455
but this isn't a ballet place.

17:24.523 --> 17:27.559
You know, I'm
much better at ironic dancing.

17:27.627 --> 17:28.894
What happened
to your accent?

17:30.063 --> 17:31.329
Sorry.

17:31.397 --> 17:33.298
I don't really have one.

17:33.366 --> 17:34.433
I don't really care.

17:42.275 --> 17:43.742
Round two.

17:43.810 --> 17:45.811
The Subway sprint.

17:45.878 --> 17:48.580
There's only one thing you got
to ask yourself, Butterman.

17:48.648 --> 17:50.949
Do you like succulent
chicken oozing

17:51.017 --> 17:52.951
with bacon and ranch dressing?

17:53.019 --> 17:54.886
I love succulent chicken.

17:54.954 --> 17:56.988
I am in your head, sir.

17:57.056 --> 17:58.924
Let's use this, use this--
are you ready?

17:58.991 --> 18:00.058
Set.

18:00.126 --> 18:01.393
Consume.

18:16.242 --> 18:17.342
Oh, keep it down

18:17.410 --> 18:18.376
or you're
disqualified.

18:18.444 --> 18:19.478
Keep it...

18:21.848 --> 18:23.248
Keep it...

18:23.316 --> 18:24.516
down.

18:24.584 --> 18:25.684
Attaboy--
get to work.

18:31.090 --> 18:32.057
Come on, come on.

18:34.093 --> 18:35.260
We have a winner.

18:35.328 --> 18:36.361
Winner!

18:39.198 --> 18:40.298
Winner.

18:41.601 --> 18:42.634
<i>The signal is weak,</i>

18:42.702 --> 18:44.069
but I still have a
trace on Chuck.

18:44.137 --> 18:45.237
He's somewhere in the club.

18:50.243 --> 18:52.244
Casey, it's him.

18:52.311 --> 18:53.678
Damn it,
he made me.

18:53.746 --> 18:54.679
Go.

18:57.216 --> 18:58.717
Freeze!
- Halt!

19:00.753 --> 19:01.887
Get on the ground.

19:01.954 --> 19:04.589
You'll want to be
more gentle with me.

19:07.260 --> 19:08.960
Get your hands up... do it!

19:09.028 --> 19:11.263
I'm going to walk away
from you now.

19:12.965 --> 19:14.432
I'd rather we all go up.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.067
Casey, be careful.

19:16.135 --> 19:19.204
Then, you should know that
Mr. Martin is still in danger.

19:19.272 --> 19:20.872
I have some friends
set to meet him.

19:20.940 --> 19:22.407
So, by all means,

19:22.475 --> 19:24.276
stay here and die.

19:24.343 --> 19:25.977
Or you can go save him.

19:26.045 --> 19:27.179
Casey.

19:27.246 --> 19:29.881
We gotta get Chuck-- come on.

19:44.664 --> 19:45.864
Chuck!

19:45.932 --> 19:47.599
We got a problem.

19:47.667 --> 19:49.601
These girls want
to take us upstairs

19:49.669 --> 19:52.270
and do despicable things to us.

19:52.338 --> 19:54.839
Tyler, Tyler, that's...
that's not such a great idea.

19:54.907 --> 19:56.908
All the best nights of my life

19:56.976 --> 19:59.377
have begun
with that very sentence.

20:09.689 --> 20:13.225
Which brings us to the final leg
of our triathlon.

20:13.292 --> 20:14.593
Good lord, is that...

20:14.660 --> 20:16.094
Yeah, Butterman, it is.

20:16.162 --> 20:17.462
May I present
to you

20:17.530 --> 20:18.730
the urinal cake.

20:22.735 --> 20:24.669
Okay, here's the deal.

20:24.737 --> 20:27.439
The winner will be
the first one of you...

20:27.506 --> 20:29.107
Ah, come on.

20:29.175 --> 20:30.542
That's disgusting.

20:30.610 --> 20:32.544
Dude, seriously,
are you kidding me?

20:32.612 --> 20:34.045
What is wrong
with you?

20:34.113 --> 20:35.747
You were just supposed
to touch it.

20:35.815 --> 20:37.148
I still win, right?

20:37.216 --> 20:39.184
All right, who stole
the urinal cakes?

20:40.319 --> 20:41.319
I splashed myself silly.

20:54.667 --> 20:58.370
Welcome to Castle de
Orlando, Spanish conquistador.

20:58.437 --> 21:00.605
So, I think we should
maybe just head...

21:00.673 --> 21:02.807
Tyler, Tyler, I need
to talk to you, buddy.

21:02.875 --> 21:04.776
In a minute, Charles.
- No, no, it's very important.

21:04.844 --> 21:06.945
I need to talk to you right now.
- Ladies, I'm so sorry.

21:07.013 --> 21:09.080
If you just go make yourself
comfortable right inside,

21:09.148 --> 21:11.016
then maybe we could
have our talk, and then

21:11.083 --> 21:12.384
we'll join you
in just a second.

21:12.451 --> 21:13.485
How does that sound?

21:13.552 --> 21:14.486
What?

21:14.553 --> 21:15.553
Thanks so much.

21:15.621 --> 21:17.022
Listen to me
very carefully, Tyler.

21:17.089 --> 21:19.257
These women are very,
very dangerous.

21:19.325 --> 21:21.026
Don't worry.

21:21.093 --> 21:23.495
I always use
protection.

21:23.562 --> 21:24.629
Good looking out.

21:24.697 --> 21:26.031
That's not what
I'm talking about.

21:26.098 --> 21:29.501
I'm begging you, just once,
deny yourself this pleasure.

21:31.137 --> 21:32.270
You're right.

21:32.338 --> 21:33.638
That's totally
selfish of me.

21:33.706 --> 21:34.839
Oh, good, lets go.

21:34.907 --> 21:36.007
You need this much
more than I do.

21:36.075 --> 21:38.843
No, no, Ty, no,
I'm not talking about...

21:38.911 --> 21:42.514
Please don't, please...

21:42.581 --> 21:43.515
Hey.

21:45.951 --> 21:47.686
I'm...
- Where's Tyler?

21:47.753 --> 21:49.154
That's an excellent question.

21:49.221 --> 21:50.989
T-Tyler, Tyler just--
he stepped away for a second,

21:51.057 --> 21:52.590
but he's gonna be right back,
I promise.

21:52.658 --> 21:55.026
I guess you'll
have to go first.

21:55.094 --> 21:56.928
Go first where,
go first what?

21:56.996 --> 21:58.196
Why-- where am I going first?

21:58.264 --> 21:59.731
Why do I have to be first?

21:59.799 --> 22:01.333
First is the worst,
second is the best,

22:01.400 --> 22:02.233
and third...!

22:03.703 --> 22:06.037
Oh, h-hi.

22:06.105 --> 22:08.106
Oh...

22:08.174 --> 22:09.874
Those are my shoes;
I need those.

22:09.942 --> 22:11.209
I need those shoes,
I need those shoes.

22:11.277 --> 22:12.711
I need those--
no, those are my pants!

22:15.781 --> 22:18.450
I think that you have
overestimated

22:18.517 --> 22:20.452
my prowess as, as, as a lover
and a man.

22:20.519 --> 22:21.753
Just looking
at you,

22:21.821 --> 22:24.923
I can feel that you require a...

22:24.990 --> 22:27.092
a real rock star, so...

22:31.197 --> 22:34.632
Tyler.

22:34.700 --> 22:36.434
What happened
to not leaving your wingman?

22:43.242 --> 22:44.909
Sarah.

22:44.977 --> 22:46.177
Where are you?

22:47.613 --> 22:49.447
Top floor, Tyler's suite,

22:49.515 --> 22:51.649
or more specifically,
the roof outside of it.

22:51.717 --> 22:54.052
Things have gotten
a little out of hand.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.554
Aah!

23:01.894 --> 23:03.795
Aah!

23:08.367 --> 23:10.402
This is so romantic.

23:10.469 --> 23:11.603
The perfect
second honeymoon.

23:14.473 --> 23:16.374
Could you push the button
for the lobby, please?

23:16.442 --> 23:17.942
No, no, n-no,
the lobby, the lobby!

23:18.010 --> 23:19.544
Where you going, where you
going, where you going?

23:19.612 --> 23:21.479
No, lob-lobby! Don't...

23:37.329 --> 23:38.563
Ladies.

23:56.310 --> 23:59.445
Ladies, you ready for me?

24:01.682 --> 24:02.782
Tyler, run!

24:04.251 --> 24:06.653
Sorry, I must be going.

24:19.266 --> 24:20.633
Get 'em, Sarah!

24:32.513 --> 24:34.147
Lobby, please.

24:35.482 --> 24:37.684
<i>Chuck, what were you thinking?</i>

24:37.751 --> 24:39.819
You know, I gave you clear
instructions to keep him here.

24:39.887 --> 24:40.853
And instead

24:40.921 --> 24:42.722
you take him to a nightclub?

24:42.790 --> 24:44.524
Interesting
tactical decision there.

24:44.591 --> 24:46.893
Well, time-out, listen, he woke
up and I couldn't stop him.

24:46.961 --> 24:48.828
Okay, I don't have a
knockout karate chop

24:48.896 --> 24:50.029
like you guys.

24:50.097 --> 24:51.464
That's not part of my skill set.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.399
Where am I?

24:53.467 --> 24:55.468
And how was I?

24:55.536 --> 24:56.602
Mr. Martin,
we're with the government.

24:56.670 --> 24:57.670
We're here to protect you.

24:57.738 --> 25:01.574
Wait, there was an elevator.

25:01.642 --> 25:02.575
Chuck, you were there.

25:02.643 --> 25:04.110
T-Two girls.

25:04.178 --> 25:05.378
One of them had a gun.

25:05.446 --> 25:06.713
I-It was pointed at me.

25:06.780 --> 25:08.915
Tyler, Tyler, it's all right.
Just like Casey said,

25:08.983 --> 25:11.484
we're here to protect you.
I need to call my manager.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.419
No, Mr. Martin, I don't think
that's a good idea because

25:13.487 --> 25:14.954
we don't know who's involved.
- I have to call

25:15.022 --> 25:16.189
my manager.

25:17.591 --> 25:19.025
Good show.

25:19.093 --> 25:20.526
Casey, what is wrong
with you?!

25:20.594 --> 25:21.661
You can't do that!

25:21.729 --> 25:23.296
You're going to give
the guy brain damage

25:23.364 --> 25:24.864
or liver problems.

25:24.932 --> 25:25.898
Too late on both counts.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.875
I know why they're trying
to kill him.

25:35.943 --> 25:37.310
I know why they want him dead.
- What?

25:37.378 --> 25:39.245
His back,
the tattoo on his back.

25:39.313 --> 25:40.446
It's not,
it's not Arabic philosophy.

25:40.514 --> 25:41.381
It's actually
a very clear message

25:41.448 --> 25:43.182
about a
private reactor

25:43.250 --> 25:44.751
that's being built
in North Africa.

25:44.818 --> 25:46.819
His manager is bringing in
the tattoo artists.

25:46.887 --> 25:48.121
Of course.

25:48.188 --> 25:50.156
He's a rock star,
he travels the world.

25:50.224 --> 25:52.525
Manager is using him
to move secrets.

25:52.593 --> 25:53.926
Idiot never even knew
what the ink meant.

25:53.994 --> 25:55.695
You know what, Casey?
You're wrong about Tyler.

25:55.763 --> 25:56.763
He's actually a pretty good guy.

25:56.830 --> 25:58.031
He's an idiot,
Bartowski,

25:58.098 --> 25:59.065
just like you.

25:59.133 --> 26:00.066
Should have never left

26:00.134 --> 26:01.167
the two of you alone.

26:01.235 --> 26:02.535
You know, Chuck,
Casey is right.

26:02.603 --> 26:03.903
I mean, you could have
gotten yourself killed.

26:03.971 --> 26:05.638
What exactly were you thinking?

26:05.706 --> 26:07.707
What was I thinking? I'll tell
you what I was thinking.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.876
I was thinking
like I wasn't a spy.

26:09.943 --> 26:12.245
Okay? I was trying to have
a little bit of fun,

26:12.312 --> 26:14.414
and I knew the second I called
you two, it would all be over.

26:14.481 --> 26:16.049
But Chuck, you <i>are</i> a spy,

26:16.116 --> 26:17.216
and you should
know better than to

26:17.284 --> 26:18.051
put yourself in a
dangerous situation

26:18.118 --> 26:20.086
where I can't protect you.

26:20.154 --> 26:23.556
Is it really so wrong
for me to want a night off?

26:23.624 --> 26:25.525
I was having a really good
time, too, until the assassins

26:25.592 --> 26:27.527
stole my pants and
tried to kill me.

26:27.594 --> 26:28.895
I've earned it.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.364
I deserve it.

26:31.432 --> 26:33.332
I'm losing consciousness.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.434
Casey!

26:35.636 --> 26:37.804
My ears couldn't take it.

26:37.871 --> 26:39.872
Either that or I shoot him.

26:45.546 --> 26:48.081
You ready for a taste

26:48.148 --> 26:49.582
of the sweet life
tonight, buddy?

26:49.650 --> 26:50.583
Yeah, sure, sure.

26:50.651 --> 26:51.951
Backstage passes.

26:52.019 --> 26:53.319
You know what that
means, don't you?

26:53.387 --> 26:55.121
No, I've never been
backstage before.

26:55.189 --> 26:57.623
That ticket's our
passport to freedom.

26:57.691 --> 26:58.891
Not only is there
free beer backstage,

26:58.959 --> 27:01.060
but there are women
that haven't been

27:01.128 --> 27:02.495
sober for years,

27:02.563 --> 27:04.397
and we're allowed in,
so the ladies assume

27:04.465 --> 27:06.265
we're not losers.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.768
Wow... it sounds
like a fairy tale.

27:08.836 --> 27:11.637
Poor Butterman.

27:11.705 --> 27:15.074
The guy's been trapped
in an 8x10 cell for years.

27:15.142 --> 27:18.544
He ate when they
said "Chow time,"

27:18.612 --> 27:22.148
and he slept when they shouted
"Lights out!"

27:22.216 --> 27:24.016
Now look at him.

27:24.084 --> 27:25.118
Broken.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.052
The man had
a choice

27:26.120 --> 27:28.421
of five sodas,

27:28.489 --> 27:30.857
a choice we take
for granted every day,

27:30.924 --> 27:34.961
a choice he's been
denied for far too long.

27:35.028 --> 27:39.198
I'm sorry, Jeff, this ticket
doesn't belong to us.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.734
This ticket belongs
to Butterman.

27:41.802 --> 27:44.137
The man deserves
his passport to freedom.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.538
You and I,

27:45.606 --> 27:47.273
we're going to give it to him.

27:47.341 --> 27:49.175
I'll make it
up to you.

27:49.243 --> 27:50.977
I'll buy you a keg.
What do you like?

27:51.044 --> 27:52.778
It's called Beer.

27:52.846 --> 27:54.614
Done... done.
- Beer brand.

27:54.681 --> 27:55.648
<i>Your flash turned
up good intel, Chuck.</i>

27:55.716 --> 27:57.583
The man you confronted

27:57.651 --> 27:59.485
last night is
Achmed Gambir,

27:59.553 --> 28:02.188
a top foot soldier in
a private army in North Africa.

28:02.256 --> 28:04.590
We've been trying to infiltrate
their ranks for years.

28:04.658 --> 28:06.425
I want you to capture Achmed
at tonight's concert.

28:06.493 --> 28:07.460
He's the key

28:07.528 --> 28:09.328
to bringing down this merc army.

28:09.396 --> 28:10.730
What-- w-w-wait, wait, wait.

28:10.797 --> 28:13.332
You want Tyler onstage as bait?

28:13.400 --> 28:15.268
General, Mr. Martin knows
there are people after him

28:15.335 --> 28:16.335
and he won't go on.

28:16.403 --> 28:20.039
Well, then convince him.

28:20.107 --> 28:21.007
Wait, no, no.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.409
No, no, guys, hey,

28:23.477 --> 28:24.610
this is way too dangerous.

28:24.678 --> 28:25.878
Tyler could get killed.

28:25.946 --> 28:27.880
Those are nightmares
tattooed on his body, Chuck.

28:27.948 --> 28:29.415
We have to take
Gambir down tonight.

28:29.483 --> 28:31.484
Okay, okay, fine, fine,
you go in there and tell him

28:31.552 --> 28:32.952
he has to put his
life on the line

28:33.020 --> 28:34.453
because he was a pawn
in someone else's game.

28:34.521 --> 28:37.156
He won't listen to us.

28:37.224 --> 28:38.257
So you want me to do it?

28:38.325 --> 28:39.525
No, absolutely not.

28:39.593 --> 28:40.860
What do you mean no?

28:40.928 --> 28:42.061
We have orders.

28:42.129 --> 28:43.462
Chuck, what is the matter
with you?

28:43.530 --> 28:45.164
This is about more
than just taking a night off.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.768
Maybe.

28:48.835 --> 28:52.338
Um, I-- you know, I'm a little
off my game right now.

28:52.406 --> 28:53.339
I'm not, not
really sleeping.

28:53.407 --> 28:54.440
I don't want
to get into it.

28:54.508 --> 28:56.609
Chuck, lives are
on the line right now,

28:56.677 --> 28:57.877
and if Tyler
doesn't help us,

28:57.945 --> 28:59.378
then he will never be free
of those people,

28:59.446 --> 29:01.814
and if you don't help us,
then Achmed Gambir gets away.

29:01.882 --> 29:05.451
And the world becomes
a more dangerous place.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.689
I don't know what happened
to you, but this is our job--

29:09.756 --> 29:11.657
not only to protect Tyler
but the country

29:11.725 --> 29:13.359
and anybody else
who needs protecting.

29:13.427 --> 29:16.429
We do whatever it takes
no matter what.

29:16.496 --> 29:17.663
Did you forget that?

29:17.731 --> 29:21.300
That I definitely
didn't forget.

29:21.368 --> 29:23.402
We don't have

29:23.470 --> 29:24.604
time for this.

29:24.671 --> 29:25.871
Wait.

29:25.939 --> 29:27.373
I'll do it.

29:27.441 --> 29:30.309
I'll convince him.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.158
Hey, man.

29:48.729 --> 29:50.730
You okay?

29:52.933 --> 29:55.401
No. No, I'm not okay.

29:55.469 --> 29:58.004
Don't know where I am,
how I got here,

29:58.071 --> 29:59.772
and someone's trying to kill me.

30:01.875 --> 30:03.943
On the plus side, your friend's
tranqs are out of this world.

30:04.011 --> 30:07.980
Yeah, it's one
of his few good qualities.

30:08.048 --> 30:09.849
I've never been in a situation
like this before,

30:09.916 --> 30:12.051
life or death.

30:12.119 --> 30:14.086
Pretty much live my life

30:14.154 --> 30:15.988
avoiding anything this real.

30:17.157 --> 30:19.258
It takes some getting used to.

30:22.496 --> 30:24.297
What do you want me to do?

30:28.468 --> 30:30.503
We would like for you

30:30.570 --> 30:32.438
to perform tonight
at your special concert.

30:32.506 --> 30:33.773
That's madness.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.441
People are trying to kill me.

30:35.509 --> 30:38.377
Yes, and you can help us
catch them.

30:38.445 --> 30:40.613
You can help the world,
the entire world,

30:40.681 --> 30:43.182
by doing this,
for real.

30:43.250 --> 30:46.786
You could go back
to living your life again.

30:46.853 --> 30:49.288
One night of bravery

30:49.356 --> 30:53.225
for an entire life
of normalcy.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.965
I can't even tell you
what I'd give for that.

31:05.739 --> 31:08.574
How do I know I can trust them?

31:08.642 --> 31:10.476
Your people?

31:11.678 --> 31:13.646
Because I do.

31:13.714 --> 31:16.482
They're the best.

31:16.550 --> 31:19.018
I stake my life on it every day.

31:23.824 --> 31:25.691
I got one thing to say.

31:29.262 --> 31:31.197
Hello, Cleveland.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.732
It's Burbank.

31:32.799 --> 31:34.700
Right. I'm dyslexic.

31:40.497 --> 31:42.665
You boys have
given me back hope.

31:42.733 --> 31:43.933
Thanks.

31:44.001 --> 31:46.102
You deserve a taste
of the sweet life, man.

31:46.169 --> 31:47.703
Enjoy it
for all of us.

31:47.771 --> 31:49.405
Do us proud, Butterman.
- Thanks.

31:59.249 --> 32:01.083
There you go.

32:05.389 --> 32:09.091
Dude, how could you just sell
the golden ticket like that?

32:09.159 --> 32:10.593
Sorry, guys.

32:10.661 --> 32:13.129
I found out how much these
things are going for online.

32:13.196 --> 32:14.730
But your
freedom, man.

32:14.798 --> 32:16.132
Was it worth the price
of freedom?

32:16.199 --> 32:19.201
Price of my freedom
is 800 bucks.

32:19.269 --> 32:20.636
Same as my ticket
to Zihuatanejo.

32:22.472 --> 32:23.339
See you never.

32:23.407 --> 32:25.775
Enjoy hell.

32:25.842 --> 32:29.311
Get busy living,
or get busy dying.

32:29.379 --> 32:31.247
True that.

32:32.883 --> 32:34.917
Well, back to work.

32:37.020 --> 32:39.055
20 minutes till
Tyler Martin takes the stage.

32:49.933 --> 32:51.767
Chuck.
- Yeah, I'm here.

32:51.835 --> 32:53.069
Don't let Tyler take the stage

32:53.136 --> 32:54.870
till we give the okay.
Okay.

32:54.938 --> 32:57.740
Got it.

32:59.342 --> 33:01.010
Sarah, made the mark.

33:01.078 --> 33:03.112
Get on my six and intercept him.

33:08.085 --> 33:09.051
Who are you?
Why you wearing this?

33:09.119 --> 33:10.619
Some guy gave me free tickets.

33:10.687 --> 33:12.722
He just said I had to wear
this stupid jacket.

33:12.789 --> 33:13.556
He's ahead of us.

33:13.623 --> 33:15.324
Which one is he?

33:25.202 --> 33:27.203
Sorry, buddy,

33:27.270 --> 33:28.804
No one allowed to
see Mr. Martin.

33:35.946 --> 33:37.546
Oh. Ha, ha.
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

33:37.614 --> 33:39.181
Let me get that.

33:39.249 --> 33:40.750
Yeah, you get it, Chuck.

33:43.186 --> 33:44.353
Open this door.

33:44.421 --> 33:46.589
It's him. It's him.
- Who?

33:46.656 --> 33:48.357
The guy who's trying
to kill you?

33:48.425 --> 33:50.326
Here? I thought
you said we were safe.

33:50.393 --> 33:51.293
I know you're in there,
Mr. Martin.

33:51.361 --> 33:52.628
Oh, I need another drink.

33:52.696 --> 33:53.496
That's a good idea.

33:54.765 --> 33:56.899
No, that's-- no. No.

33:56.967 --> 33:58.601
Hey, get in there. Get in there.
- I said open

33:58.668 --> 34:00.035
this door!
- What about you, Chuck?

34:00.103 --> 34:01.971
I'll be all right. Just,
just stay in the closet.

34:02.038 --> 34:03.873
Wait.

34:03.940 --> 34:05.541
Take off your shirt.

34:05.609 --> 34:06.408
Just trust me.

34:09.846 --> 34:10.513
Hey.

34:14.251 --> 34:15.184
Sarah, it's Chuck.

34:15.284 --> 34:16.918
Chuck. What is it?

34:16.987 --> 34:19.121
Achmed. Achmed's right outside
the dressing room.

34:19.188 --> 34:20.623
I-I don't know what happened
to the guards.

34:20.690 --> 34:22.324
Okay, Chuck, stay
right where you are.

34:22.391 --> 34:24.059
I'm coming. Sarah, look,
I didn't need the night off.

34:24.127 --> 34:25.995
You were right, it's something
else. I should've told you.

34:26.062 --> 34:26.862
I should have....

34:28.165 --> 34:29.264
Chuck?

34:29.331 --> 34:30.966
Chuck, can you hear me?

34:31.034 --> 34:32.101
Move. Excuse me. Go!

34:32.168 --> 34:33.668
I think maybe,

34:33.737 --> 34:35.036
maybe you have

34:35.105 --> 34:36.272
the wrong room.

34:41.645 --> 34:43.679
Tell me where he is?

34:43.746 --> 34:45.114
Tell you where who is?

34:46.382 --> 34:47.149
Oh!

34:47.217 --> 34:47.983
Oh, where-where

34:48.051 --> 34:49.083
he is-- where Tyler is.

34:49.152 --> 34:51.219
Right. He,
you know, he--

34:51.288 --> 34:52.353
he skipped out.
I don't know where he is.

34:52.422 --> 34:53.722
So sorry.
I don't know.

34:53.790 --> 34:55.024
He's gone.

34:57.127 --> 34:59.728
He's in the closet.

35:01.064 --> 35:02.097
Excuse me. Move!

35:02.165 --> 35:03.098
Coming through. Move.

35:05.135 --> 35:07.002
Okay, you got us.

35:07.070 --> 35:08.304
Yeah, worse plan ever.

35:08.371 --> 35:09.572
But I know about
the tattoo.

35:09.639 --> 35:11.173
I know what it means.

35:11.241 --> 35:12.708
You and your

35:12.776 --> 35:14.243
private army enriching uranium,

35:14.311 --> 35:16.245
selling it to
unstable countries.

35:16.313 --> 35:17.313
Using Tyler's manager
and his tattoos

35:17.380 --> 35:18.314
to pass the info off

35:18.381 --> 35:19.915
to your buyers.

35:19.983 --> 35:21.450
You take one more step,

35:21.518 --> 35:23.719
I send this e-mail
and everyone knows.

35:23.787 --> 35:26.522
Proving that the cell is
mightier than the sword.

35:26.590 --> 35:28.757
Or, or a very
large knife,

35:28.825 --> 35:30.092
as it might be
in this case.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.694
Go! Excuse me. Move!

35:31.761 --> 35:32.895
Put it down.

35:34.331 --> 35:35.064
Put it down!

35:44.608 --> 35:45.808
No!

35:45.876 --> 35:46.909
No!

35:46.977 --> 35:48.878
I can't let you do this
for me Chuck.

35:48.945 --> 35:51.013
Actually, my plan was
working very well.

35:53.717 --> 35:54.683
No!
- No!

35:59.089 --> 36:00.489
Follow me.
- Tyler, what's going on, man?

36:00.557 --> 36:01.857
Gavin, you're fired!

36:01.925 --> 36:02.825
Sarah, we're running
to the stage.

36:02.893 --> 36:03.826
He's right behind us.

36:03.894 --> 36:05.394
Chuck, are you okay?

36:05.462 --> 36:06.762
Yeah, yeah, just get us
out of here.

36:06.830 --> 36:09.265
Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!

36:09.332 --> 36:12.034
Everybody give
it up for Tyler Martin!

36:14.905 --> 36:17.206
Hey!

36:18.875 --> 36:20.175
Whoo!

36:22.178 --> 36:22.945
Help.

36:26.969 --> 36:29.136
Wow!

36:29.204 --> 36:31.005
Los Angeles.

36:32.140 --> 36:32.707
What do we do now?

36:41.083 --> 36:42.116
Jump.

36:42.184 --> 36:43.818
What?
- Jump.

36:45.854 --> 36:46.120
Chuck!

36:46.855 --> 36:47.288
Jump!

36:59.434 --> 37:00.935
It's all good, it's all good,
Chuck, relax.

37:01.003 --> 37:03.404
Come on, take it easy.
Okay, okay.

37:11.246 --> 37:13.114
Stephanie, right? Stephanie.

37:13.181 --> 37:13.748
Yeah!

37:36.638 --> 37:37.538
You think I look mad,

37:37.606 --> 37:39.173
wait till you see her.

37:44.479 --> 37:46.013
Hey.

37:46.081 --> 37:47.748
A little too much to drink
there, huh, pal?

37:47.816 --> 37:49.050
Uh, let's get you some coffee.

37:49.117 --> 37:51.118
We got him! Ha, ha, ha!

37:51.186 --> 37:52.920
See? I told you
they were the best!

37:52.988 --> 37:54.155
Yeah, that's it, all right.

37:54.222 --> 37:55.289
Now back to the stage.

37:55.357 --> 37:56.824
Come on, I want to sing now.

37:56.892 --> 37:59.460
All right, like he said,
back to the stage.

37:59.528 --> 38:00.995
Who the hell are you?

38:12.708 --> 38:14.175
Grimes?

38:14.242 --> 38:15.476
Where's my boy Butterman?

38:15.544 --> 38:16.811
Um, he kind of took off
suddenly.

38:16.878 --> 38:17.845
Can't say I blame him.

38:17.913 --> 38:18.913
Man's gotta run free

38:18.980 --> 38:20.214
after being locked up so long.

38:20.282 --> 38:22.149
Yeah, yeah, well,
um, Big Mike,

38:22.217 --> 38:23.517
do mind if I ask you

38:23.585 --> 38:24.952
what Butterman was
in the can for?

38:25.020 --> 38:26.687
I mean, you talking
robbery? Drugs?

38:26.755 --> 38:27.855
Murder?

38:27.923 --> 38:29.323
Butterman?

38:29.391 --> 38:31.125
Yeah.
- God, no!

38:31.193 --> 38:33.194
Bank fraud, insider trading.

38:33.261 --> 38:35.096
The man's a white-collar
criminal.

38:35.163 --> 38:36.530
Why? He take you fools
for some money?

38:36.598 --> 38:38.899
He said he was going somewhere.

38:38.967 --> 38:39.700
Zihuatanejo?

38:42.504 --> 38:44.305
That's Mexican for Philadelphia.

38:46.007 --> 38:48.676
I knew I should have
learned Spanish.

38:48.744 --> 38:51.545
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>my manager's going to jail.</i>

38:51.613 --> 38:52.913
Think about it.

38:52.981 --> 38:54.715
No privacy.

38:54.783 --> 38:56.650
It'd be like hell
on bloody earth.

38:56.718 --> 38:59.053
Yeah. Tell me about it.

38:59.121 --> 39:00.421
You understand
why you're gonna have

39:00.489 --> 39:01.756
to get your tattoos
removed, right?

39:01.823 --> 39:02.857
Oh, yeah, yeah.

39:02.924 --> 39:04.625
I hear you're the bro
to talk to

39:04.693 --> 39:06.494
to get more of those
tasty tranq darts.

39:07.729 --> 39:09.797
Philistine.

39:10.966 --> 39:12.533
Thanks, Chuck.

39:12.601 --> 39:14.034
Oh, hey, it was nothing.

39:14.102 --> 39:15.436
No, no,
it was everything.

39:15.504 --> 39:18.906
You taught me to put people
in front of myself.

39:18.974 --> 39:21.909
Felt kind
of wonderful.

39:21.977 --> 39:23.377
I can strike that
off the list now.

39:24.913 --> 39:26.814
If you ever want to party,
you know where to come.

39:26.882 --> 39:28.849
Yeah, actually, I don't think
that's my scene.

39:28.917 --> 39:30.551
Smart man, Chuck.

39:30.619 --> 39:31.585
Smart man.

39:33.321 --> 39:34.722
All right.

39:34.790 --> 39:36.157
All right.

39:36.224 --> 39:37.391
Take it easy.
- You, too.

39:37.459 --> 39:38.692
Hello, Mr. Martin.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.127
Oh.
- Your limousine is waiting outside.

39:40.195 --> 39:42.830
You know my name.

39:42.898 --> 39:44.598
Have we made love before?

39:44.666 --> 39:46.233
No.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.202
Daddy's got to go.

39:48.270 --> 39:50.671
Sorry. Later.

39:58.814 --> 40:00.047
You did a great
job, Chuck.

40:00.115 --> 40:01.982
Thanks.

40:04.319 --> 40:06.320
Look, if-if there's something
bothering you,

40:06.388 --> 40:07.321
then please tell me.

40:07.389 --> 40:09.490
I know part of your job

40:09.558 --> 40:10.958
is to have all these
secrets in your head,

40:11.026 --> 40:13.327
but you're not supposed
to keep them from me.

40:13.395 --> 40:15.796
I know. I know.

40:20.836 --> 40:23.103
I saw you shoot that
FULCRUM agent on Christmas Eve

40:23.171 --> 40:26.640
after they took
over the Buy More.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.377
And when I asked you about it...

40:30.445 --> 40:31.445
I lied.

40:31.513 --> 40:33.013
Yeah.

40:33.081 --> 40:35.683
Chuck, I have to protect you.

40:35.750 --> 40:38.385
I know that. I, I...

40:38.453 --> 40:39.787
I know that you do.

40:39.855 --> 40:42.089
And you were
protecting me.

40:42.157 --> 40:43.324
You were protecting
all of us.

40:43.391 --> 40:45.626
He had threatened
my family, my friends,

40:45.694 --> 40:47.962
and you were just doing
your job-- I get that, but...

40:49.965 --> 40:51.332
Sarah, the guy was unarmed

40:51.399 --> 40:53.100
and, and you just...
I did what I had to.

40:53.168 --> 40:54.768
He knew who
you really were.

40:54.836 --> 40:56.871
Your whole family
was in danger.

40:56.938 --> 40:58.772
And I'm sorry.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.976
Sometimes I forget that
you never asked for all of this.

41:05.046 --> 41:07.147
There's parts I'm not sure
I'll ever get used to.

41:09.918 --> 41:12.586
Well, you deserve a break.

41:12.654 --> 41:14.054
So, take tonight,
tomorrow--

41:14.122 --> 41:16.524
whatever you need,
it's yours.

41:16.591 --> 41:17.791
Seriously? Really?

41:17.859 --> 41:20.694
Yeah, no missions,
no cameras, no Casey,

41:20.762 --> 41:23.831
no thermal satellite
surveillance and no me.

41:23.899 --> 41:26.066
You guys use satellites?

41:26.134 --> 41:27.134
Yeah.

41:27.202 --> 41:28.335
Oh.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.504
And Chuck,
when you're ready again,

41:30.572 --> 41:31.438
we'll be here, waiting.

41:34.342 --> 41:35.442
Hey, what's this?
What's going on?

41:35.510 --> 41:36.443
Lock and load.

41:36.511 --> 41:37.745
A new mission.

41:37.812 --> 41:38.779
We'll see you tomorrow.

41:40.181 --> 41:41.582
Wait, a new,
a new mission?

41:41.650 --> 41:42.683
What kind of mission?

41:42.751 --> 41:44.785
It's fine, Chuck.

41:44.853 --> 41:47.288
We've got it.

41:48.957 --> 41:50.991
What, what kind of mission?

41:53.962 --> 41:55.596
Ah, finally,

41:55.664 --> 41:57.965
a mission without Bartowski.

41:58.033 --> 41:59.033
I'm going to enjoy this.

41:59.100 --> 42:02.436
Okay, guys.

42:02.504 --> 42:03.804
Where are we going?

42:05.540 --> 42:07.107
Well, come on, Casey.

42:07.175 --> 42:09.109
No time for a break,
we've got work to do.
