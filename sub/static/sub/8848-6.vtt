00:14.598 --> 00:16.164
Make sure that's tight.

00:22.571 --> 00:24.949
Closer.
Closer to the platform.

00:25.074 --> 00:27.319
Musicians come on,
over here, over here.

00:27.485 --> 00:28.519
Thank you.

00:28.644 --> 00:30.156
Ah, what... what are you going to play?

00:30.322 --> 00:32.211
Uh, Dixie.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.824
Dixie, you idiot.

00:33.949 --> 00:35.995
"Battle Hymn of the Republic,"
do you know it?

00:38.163 --> 00:40.697
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:40.822 --> 00:44.567
Uh, photographer, over here,
please, on the platform

00:44.692 --> 00:47.882
with me and be at the ready.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.509
Now, on my signal, be ready
to play, loudly.

00:58.872 --> 01:00.983
Ah.

01:01.108 --> 01:05.649
She takes my arm even though
she stabs me in the back.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.957
Have you given my proposal
any further consideration?

01:09.082 --> 01:12.493
You mean the money you're squeezing
out of me for Robert's maps?

01:12.618 --> 01:14.742
I'm only asking
for what is fair, Thomas.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.266
Extortion doesn't become a lady.

01:18.391 --> 01:20.767
I will not fall prey to it.

01:23.662 --> 01:25.863
Excuse me.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.679
Play, play, play, play, play.

01:58.762 --> 02:01.397
Ah, Jordan.
Welcome, welcome.

02:06.293 --> 02:11.916
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
an honor for me to introduce

02:12.041 --> 02:15.377
a true friend of the
railroad who has come here

02:16.011 --> 02:18.279
with the full backing of
the United States Senate,

02:18.404 --> 02:23.160
to meet with the Indians,
to thwart their opposition to our cause.

02:23.285 --> 02:29.423
From the great state of Illinois...
Senator Jordan Crane.

02:33.028 --> 02:36.507
On behalf of my fellow
committee members,

02:36.632 --> 02:39.175
I thank you for that warm reception.

02:39.300 --> 02:42.177
But down to business.

02:42.302 --> 02:45.314
As Mr. Durant said, I am here,

02:45.439 --> 02:51.086
Laurel branch in hand,
to meet with the Indians.

02:51.211 --> 02:57.094
But in the other hand,
I wield a cudgel,

02:57.260 --> 03:00.765
and that cudgel is
the full and mighty force

03:00.931 --> 03:03.031
of the United States Military.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.168
If these savages want to scrap,

03:07.293 --> 03:10.816
then by God, we'll give them
one they won't soon disremember.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.379
Well done, Jordan.

03:19.504 --> 03:20.576
Well done.

03:51.731 --> 03:55.027
<font color="#3399FF">Sync and correction by Mlmlte</font>
<font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:04.380 --> 04:07.483
All right, let me grab a saddle.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.471
It's a sad state of affairs.

04:21.596 --> 04:24.232
I'll drink to that.

04:29.971 --> 04:34.750
Reverend... you ain't in
here for a drink, are you?

04:34.875 --> 04:38.044
No. A spirit of a different
sort now possesses me.

04:43.917 --> 04:47.371
I come here, Mr. Bohannon, hat in hand.

04:49.222 --> 04:52.401
I wish to hell you would stop
trying to save me, preacher.

04:52.526 --> 04:57.205
Oh, don't worry, son,
I'm learning my limitations,

04:57.330 --> 05:01.177
but the lord believes one
good turn deserves another.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.079
And since I provided asylum for you,

05:04.204 --> 05:06.515
I've come here to ask for your help.

05:06.681 --> 05:10.311
What kind of help could
I possibly provide you?

05:10.477 --> 05:13.487
Well, a band of Cheyenne
is coming to talk peace

05:13.612 --> 05:15.989
with the Senator and Mr. Durant.

05:16.114 --> 05:17.291
Yeah. I heard.

05:17.416 --> 05:21.197
Whose crazy-ass idea was that?

05:21.363 --> 05:23.996
I beg your pardon, preacher,

05:24.121 --> 05:28.525
but... somehow,
I don't see that ending well.

05:30.228 --> 05:32.405
I want you to talk
to your walking bosses,

05:32.530 --> 05:36.776
you tell them to keep
their men in check

05:36.901 --> 05:41.133
because if you don't,
we're gonna have bloodshed on our hands.

05:44.474 --> 05:49.111
I'll do what I can.

05:52.148 --> 05:54.716
Do I have your word?

06:02.279 --> 06:07.451
A toast in honor of
the fair-haired maiden of the west.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.372
Your spirit is a testament to all.

06:09.497 --> 06:11.765
Thank you, Senator.

06:13.801 --> 06:16.846
You must be anxious
to return to society.

06:16.971 --> 06:18.628
I am.

06:18.794 --> 06:23.342
But first, I must tend
to some unfinished business.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.254
Well, speaking of which,

06:25.379 --> 06:27.656
you won't mind if Mr. Durant and I

06:27.781 --> 06:29.391
discuss some business of our own?

06:29.516 --> 06:31.059
Not at all, Senator, please.

06:31.184 --> 06:36.022
So, doc, I hear there was
some delay with your payroll.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.299
Why the money problems?

06:37.424 --> 06:39.268
Oh, ha ha.

06:39.393 --> 06:41.969
A miscommunication between
the bank and Pinkerton's.

06:42.094 --> 06:46.040
No, no, no, the, uh,
the payroll was delivered and made.

06:46.165 --> 06:49.410
Well, then the credit issue with
the banks must also be resolved?

06:49.576 --> 06:51.245
Credit issue?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.481
Well, I don't know the particulars,

06:53.606 --> 06:58.619
but word is credit was no longer
being extended to the Union Pacific.

06:58.744 --> 07:02.589
Oh, Senator, if our
credit line wasn't open,

07:02.714 --> 07:04.675
we wouldn't be able to operate.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.677
Hmm.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.096
What about the route to the Rockies?

07:10.221 --> 07:12.016
The Rockies, what of it?

07:12.182 --> 07:16.569
Thomas has been trying
to explain it to me.

07:16.694 --> 07:19.706
I think I finally
managed to grasp it.

07:19.831 --> 07:23.043
That the route my husband
mapped through the Rockies

07:23.168 --> 07:26.112
holds the key to Thomas
choosing the right path

07:26.237 --> 07:27.949
to make his 40 miles here.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.873
Is that right, doc?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.218
Well, I wouldn't go...

07:33.343 --> 07:35.998
Do you have these maps?

07:37.848 --> 07:39.752
No.

07:41.050 --> 07:42.255
Well...

07:42.421 --> 07:43.928
Well, that is unfortunate.

07:44.053 --> 07:45.730
Mm-hmm.

07:45.855 --> 07:49.267
No 40 miles by may 16th,
no government subsidies.

07:49.392 --> 07:51.035
You have heard that
the Central Pacific

07:51.160 --> 07:54.271
have made their 40, haven't you?

07:54.396 --> 07:55.539
No.

07:55.664 --> 07:57.353
Oh, yes.

07:57.519 --> 08:00.481
It seems these Chinamen are
quite the busy worker bees.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.817
Then she say for one of these,
I can get whatever I want.

08:10.678 --> 08:13.847
Yeah, I need a word
with Mr. Ferguson.

08:16.451 --> 08:19.052
If that's all right?

08:21.222 --> 08:23.857
I'll talk to him.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.341
You ain't gotta worry about
us messin' with no Injuns.

08:32.466 --> 08:35.176
Ain't no Redman
ever bloodied my back.

08:35.301 --> 08:37.746
I got your word, then?

08:37.871 --> 08:39.013
Good.

08:39.138 --> 08:41.450
We don't need no more
fightin', do we?

08:41.575 --> 08:44.567
I see how you feel that way...
After that ass whoopin' I put on ya.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.652
I got news for you, son,
I know you cheated.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.030
What the hell are you talking about?

08:49.196 --> 08:50.824
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

08:50.949 --> 08:54.076
Pepper juice on them hand wraps
you was wearing, I tasted it.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.497
I got to hand it to you,
though, that was pretty slick.

08:56.622 --> 08:58.465
You need to hand
that to somebody else.

08:58.590 --> 09:00.915
I don't know nothin'
about no pepper juice.

09:01.726 --> 09:03.260
Hmm.

09:04.562 --> 09:06.631
Somebody sure as hell cheated.

09:06.797 --> 09:10.901
If you want a re-match,
you know where to find me.

09:12.771 --> 09:14.771
Yeah.

09:33.122 --> 09:35.757
How did your mother die?

09:37.427 --> 09:39.127
Consumption.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.931
She's with God now.

09:44.585 --> 09:48.135
Yes, she is.

09:50.672 --> 09:53.340
My mother died when I was just a boy.

09:55.143 --> 09:57.354
I remember her taking me

09:57.479 --> 09:59.947
to the creek to wash in the mornings.

10:02.320 --> 10:06.274
She'd pretend to drop me,
and then grab me fast.

10:08.288 --> 10:10.319
No matter how many times she did it,

10:10.485 --> 10:13.793
it would always make me laugh.

10:17.731 --> 10:20.163
She's with God now, too.

10:23.002 --> 10:24.834
Was your mother a Christian?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.419
No.

10:28.808 --> 10:31.632
Then how can she be with God?

10:47.158 --> 10:50.777
I'm sorry your father left
you and your mother alone.

10:59.236 --> 11:02.914
My father did not leave us.

11:03.080 --> 11:09.420
He was called away on
his great Christian mission.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.124
He's a servant of God.

11:12.249 --> 11:15.928
He was called to help
the inferiors...

11:16.053 --> 11:19.428
Like... Negroes.

11:19.972 --> 11:23.434
And the Indians?

11:48.183 --> 11:53.163
Would you like to hold it for me,
or do you have some information?

11:53.288 --> 11:56.365
Mr. Durant has taken private funds

11:56.490 --> 12:00.636
from the railroad
for his personnel use.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.890
How much, and for what?

12:03.056 --> 12:06.675
$147,000.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.356
He is speculating
on the railroad stock.

12:14.107 --> 12:17.152
Money is not necessary this time.

12:17.277 --> 12:18.698
Oh?

12:18.864 --> 12:23.082
I would like information instead.

12:26.319 --> 12:28.541
What do you mean?

12:28.707 --> 12:31.855
There is a man named Harper,

12:32.252 --> 12:34.701
a former union soldier,

12:34.826 --> 12:39.039
sergeant Frank Harper, I believe.

12:39.164 --> 12:41.575
He used to work for us.

12:41.700 --> 12:45.892
He run off, and I'd like
to know where he is.

12:46.058 --> 12:49.771
How am I supposed to find him?

12:49.937 --> 12:54.988
I heard sergeant Harper hails
from your home state of Illinois.

12:55.113 --> 13:01.950
Matter of fact, he still has family
that reside in the city of Chicago.

13:03.553 --> 13:05.230
Frank Harper, huh?

13:05.355 --> 13:06.698
Well, I have my people...

13:06.823 --> 13:09.125
Yes, you will.

14:29.878 --> 14:33.047
Set it out somewhere here.

14:40.155 --> 14:41.382
There you go, man.

14:44.343 --> 14:46.804
Keep it moving there, lads.

14:48.263 --> 14:49.307
Hep, hep.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.814
Clear!

14:56.980 --> 14:59.272
Down!

15:06.323 --> 15:09.535
I'll be damned.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.871
Come on now, up and out
of there, boys.

15:12.037 --> 15:14.791
It's our time for
collecting some scalps.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.634
Y'all Negroes get back in that cut.

15:19.759 --> 15:21.727
We ain't got no fight
with them Injuns.

15:22.339 --> 15:23.605
Y'all heard the man.

15:23.730 --> 15:24.926
Well, well.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.431
What's the matter, boy-o?

15:27.052 --> 15:29.776
You niggers afraid the nappy
fuzz will be sliced off

15:29.901 --> 15:31.099
the top of your pates, are ya?

15:31.265 --> 15:33.113
We ain't got no dog in this fight.

15:33.238 --> 15:34.561
You on your own.

15:34.727 --> 15:35.815
We got business, you and me,

15:35.940 --> 15:37.855
and I'll see it done, so I will.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.566
Why are we stopped?

15:39.732 --> 15:41.288
We ain't.

15:41.413 --> 15:43.624
Toole, get your men back in that cut!

15:43.749 --> 15:45.125
We got a road to build.

15:45.250 --> 15:47.059
I want y'all sons of bitches
working, all of you.

15:47.184 --> 15:50.326
I don't take orders from
any man walloped by a nigger.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.959
You're fired.
Get off my cut.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.439
I'll fix your flank
for this, Bohannon.

16:00.564 --> 16:01.877
You have my word on that.

16:02.043 --> 16:03.975
Oh, yeah?

16:04.100 --> 16:05.884
Get off my cut.

16:08.672 --> 16:11.139
Come on, lads, let's go.

16:18.354 --> 16:19.939
Aw, the hell with it.

16:21.523 --> 16:24.777
Get out the hell out of me way.

16:24.943 --> 16:27.431
All right, there's work to get done.

16:27.556 --> 16:31.001
Y'all forget about them Injuns,
and you give me the full chisel,

16:31.126 --> 16:34.704
assholes and elbows,
or I'll fire the lot of ya.

16:40.668 --> 16:44.947
You seem to have an answer
for everything, Thomas.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.516
I always do.

16:46.641 --> 16:48.384
But why should I believe you?

16:48.509 --> 16:51.420
Well, why wouldn't you, Jordan?

16:51.545 --> 16:53.021
It's the truth.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.490
We've worked
together long enough

16:55.615 --> 16:57.727
for you to give me a little
more credit than that.

16:57.893 --> 17:01.523
Is there a point you're
trying to make, Jordan?

17:01.689 --> 17:04.223
To the point.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.824
I'm well aware of your schemes.

17:10.990 --> 17:13.840
And to put it plain,
they don't concern me,

17:13.965 --> 17:19.707
except...
When they concern me.

17:24.076 --> 17:27.006
Jordan, why are you really here?

17:27.172 --> 17:31.358
I'm here to tell you
that filching Union Pacific railroad

17:31.483 --> 17:34.556
funds for personal speculating
concerns me greatly.

17:34.722 --> 17:38.364
Another unfounded rumor
created by my rivals.

17:38.489 --> 17:39.811
Hmm.

17:39.977 --> 17:45.358
$147,000.

17:48.366 --> 17:50.697
How's that for an unfounded rumor?

17:54.237 --> 17:57.149
People say you've lost a lot
of money in the market, doc.

17:57.274 --> 18:01.153
Is it really so bad
that it's come to this?

18:01.278 --> 18:04.846
I have nothing more
to say about this.

Don't be afraid.

19:22.887 --> 19:25.922
You're among friends.

19:27.359 --> 19:30.797
I am reverend Cole.

19:30.963 --> 19:37.303
These are my children,
Joseph and Ruth.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.431
We are pleased you have come here

19:39.597 --> 19:44.649
in the name of peace and fellowship.

19:44.774 --> 19:48.743
Are you the daughter he abandoned?

19:51.108 --> 19:53.358
Maybe peace and fellowship are more

19:53.483 --> 19:57.552
important to him than his own family?

20:02.825 --> 20:07.962
This, Senator Crane,
is from the United States Government.

20:09.398 --> 20:13.477
Do you understand?

20:13.602 --> 20:17.093
I speak your language.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.981
Well, good.

20:19.106 --> 20:23.620
Uh, Senator Crane has come here

20:23.745 --> 20:26.436
to offer your people
a better way of life.

20:26.602 --> 20:28.438
Better than what?

20:28.604 --> 20:32.400
Oh, better than what you have.

20:35.589 --> 20:37.655
I like what I have.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.067
Hmm.

20:39.192 --> 20:41.637
I understand that...

20:41.762 --> 20:46.539
But... your people
live in the stone age.

20:48.582 --> 20:51.979
We live at the beginning

20:52.104 --> 20:54.372
of a great industrial revolution.

20:54.672 --> 20:56.050
He doesn't understand...

20:56.175 --> 20:57.801
Chief, chief, chief,

20:57.967 --> 21:00.588
the United States Government
is offering you

21:00.713 --> 21:02.931
a piece of land of your own.

21:03.097 --> 21:05.493
We have our own land.

21:05.618 --> 21:08.118
No, it's not yours.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.105
It's the U.S. Government's.

21:10.271 --> 21:12.065
Did they buy it?

21:12.231 --> 21:14.359
- No.
- Did they trade for it?

21:14.525 --> 21:15.707
It's not like that. We...

21:15.832 --> 21:17.487
Then how can they own it?

21:19.238 --> 21:20.407
He has a point.

21:25.469 --> 21:28.280
If you accept our offer,

21:28.405 --> 21:32.419
you won't have to hunt buffalo
anymore or roam the prairie.

21:32.585 --> 21:36.089
You can depend on your
country to take care of you.

21:37.633 --> 21:40.176
You are not my country.

21:41.584 --> 21:44.228
We will give you everything you need

21:44.353 --> 21:48.226
if you will just submit
to living on a reservation.

21:48.392 --> 21:51.396
We need nothing from you.

21:51.562 --> 21:53.606
Mr. Durant, if we could just...

21:53.772 --> 21:56.206
I'm done, reverend!

Good luck.

I told her Jesus Christ

22:41.206 --> 22:43.684
born of a virgin.

22:53.951 --> 22:56.544
What did she say, Joseph?

22:57.955 --> 23:02.201
She said, she would like
to hear Mary explain

23:02.326 --> 23:04.803
the virgin birth to her husband.

23:28.584 --> 23:30.245
Mr. Bohannon.

Ahem.

23:32.088 --> 23:35.250
Ma'am.

23:35.416 --> 23:37.419
What are you doing here?

23:37.585 --> 23:40.003
Well, I guess I made
a stupid promise to somebody.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.799
I figured the last thing
you'd want to see is an Indian.

23:42.965 --> 23:45.642
Well, these are peaceful Indians.

23:45.767 --> 23:47.707
They're Joseph's people.

23:47.832 --> 23:49.012
Yeah, right.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.914
Yeah, you're right, go ahead.

23:51.039 --> 23:54.774
No, it's not the Indians
I'm worried about.

23:57.477 --> 24:02.257
You'll be happy to
know I've taken your advice.

24:02.382 --> 24:05.071
I'm making arrangements
for passage back east.

24:05.552 --> 24:07.267
Best place for you.

24:07.392 --> 24:08.263
Right.

24:08.388 --> 24:11.494
Well, if you'd excuse...

24:19.585 --> 24:20.754
What's wrong?

24:22.235 --> 24:23.911
Mrs. Bell?

24:24.036 --> 24:26.046
Where did you get that?
That's mine!

24:27.538 --> 24:28.882
Not yours.

24:29.007 --> 24:30.283
Stop. It's all right.

24:30.408 --> 24:32.243
Take your hands off me! Go!

24:32.368 --> 24:33.555
Calm down!

24:40.940 --> 24:41.994
Take...

24:42.119 --> 24:45.421
That was your husband's
hat, wasn't it?

24:46.556 --> 24:48.424
Wasn't it?

24:51.061 --> 24:53.328
What happened, Mr. Bohannon?

24:53.494 --> 24:54.913
You... you lied to me.

24:55.079 --> 24:56.540
It was your people.

25:02.272 --> 25:03.906
Where are you headed?

25:04.255 --> 25:07.052
I'm going to tell
Mr. Durant that they're here,

25:07.177 --> 25:08.953
the ones that committed the massacre.

25:09.078 --> 25:10.221
The ones who murdered my husband.

25:10.346 --> 25:11.923
Are you sure you want to do that?

25:12.048 --> 25:14.095
Yes, of course I do.
Why wouldn't I?

25:14.261 --> 25:15.559
Because it will lead to more killin',
not just the braves,

25:15.684 --> 25:16.935
but the women and children, too.

25:17.101 --> 25:19.320
What is your stake
in this, Mr. Bohannon?

25:19.603 --> 25:21.273
Lady, I ain't got one.

25:21.439 --> 25:24.025
Then why do you care?

25:25.894 --> 25:28.839
Mrs. Bell,
there is a price attached to everything.

25:28.964 --> 25:32.200
You think you can afford
the cost of this, then you go on.

25:44.420 --> 25:47.094
You must think of
your women and children.

25:47.219 --> 25:49.217
I am thinking of them.

25:49.383 --> 25:50.798
How can I ask them

25:50.923 --> 25:53.433
to give up what they have for this?

25:53.558 --> 25:57.976
I have never seen such
a dark, filthy place.

25:58.142 --> 26:02.574
If you walk away from
here without a deal,

26:02.699 --> 26:04.691
you are asking for war.

26:04.857 --> 26:08.915
No. You ask for war.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.049
Listen to reason.

26:11.174 --> 26:12.782
Your people will be slaughtered.

26:12.948 --> 26:14.367
As will yours.

26:14.533 --> 26:15.653
Gentlemen!

26:15.778 --> 26:18.489
We're here to find
a way to peace, not war.

26:18.614 --> 26:22.360
Be warned, we Cheyenne are plenty,

26:22.485 --> 26:24.419
and my braves are
hungry for a good fight.

26:24.585 --> 26:26.463
Enough, Jordan, enough.

26:26.629 --> 26:28.032
You're pissing in the wind.

26:28.157 --> 26:30.734
They only understand
one thing... strength.

26:30.859 --> 26:34.721
Now, let me give it to you
plain and simple, chief.

26:34.887 --> 26:40.352
This train means the end
of life as you know it.

26:40.518 --> 26:45.081
My son had a vision.

26:45.206 --> 26:48.860
He will defeat your train.

26:55.816 --> 26:57.160
Wait.

26:57.326 --> 27:01.529
Chief, perhaps your son
would like a chance

27:01.654 --> 27:06.586
to see his vision come true, hmm?

28:09.652 --> 28:11.193
Hello, ladies.

28:18.427 --> 28:20.671
What is this all about?

28:20.796 --> 28:24.866
It seems an Injun's gonna
race a train back to town.

28:26.868 --> 28:29.711
I guess you changed your mind.

28:33.474 --> 28:35.467
For the moment.

29:48.664 --> 29:50.959
Stoke that fire.

30:56.023 --> 30:58.151
Come on. Come on.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.918
Come on! Come on!

31:47.289 --> 31:48.633
Yeah!

31:48.758 --> 31:51.747
Ha ha ha ha.

32:27.752 --> 32:34.957
Well, I think the chief
got my message loud and clear.

32:36.412 --> 32:37.396
Don't you?

32:37.521 --> 32:39.108
Well done, doc.

32:39.233 --> 32:40.340
Ahem.

32:41.345 --> 32:44.508
But there's still the
matter of a $147,000.

32:47.289 --> 32:49.621
One word from me, and
hordes of investigators

32:49.746 --> 32:52.307
will be crawling through your books.

33:01.261 --> 33:03.405
You're bluffing.

33:03.530 --> 33:05.404
What makes you think so?

33:05.570 --> 33:08.910
Because if I fall, you fall with me.

33:09.035 --> 33:13.579
Not so, doc.

33:13.745 --> 33:16.041
Not so.

33:18.750 --> 33:21.455
I sold all
my landholdings in Nebraska,

33:21.580 --> 33:25.159
and I've divested myself of
my Credit Mobilier stock.

33:25.284 --> 33:28.452
All at a nice profit, I might add.

33:30.789 --> 33:33.265
You have nothing over me anymore.

33:35.959 --> 33:40.272
You once had my head
in a vice, Thomas,

33:40.438 --> 33:44.110
now, I have your pecker in my pocket.

33:44.235 --> 33:48.447
I'll be leaving for Chicago tonight

33:48.572 --> 33:50.278
and will report this
as soon as I arrive.

33:50.615 --> 33:54.536
You'll be trading in your fancy
duds for prison pinstripes.

33:54.702 --> 33:56.788
You're finished, Durant.

33:56.913 --> 33:59.481
All this, gone.

34:00.517 --> 34:02.336
Jordan, please.

34:26.442 --> 34:28.277
She wants you to take this.

34:30.737 --> 34:33.089
And she wanted you to know she, too,

34:33.214 --> 34:35.225
has lost her husband.

34:35.350 --> 34:38.827
He was killed in a fight
with one of his own arrows.

34:38.952 --> 34:40.498
The other braves,

34:40.665 --> 34:43.543
they brought her this hat.

35:14.157 --> 35:15.993
Tell her thank you.

36:02.431 --> 36:04.808
We will not return.

36:04.933 --> 36:06.543
Chief, I beg you to reconsider.

36:06.668 --> 36:09.313
Son, these people are not good.

36:09.438 --> 36:11.715
You stay here, you will die.

36:13.273 --> 36:15.427
Come back with me.

36:15.593 --> 36:18.096
Please. Come home with your father.

36:18.262 --> 36:21.424
I can't, father.

36:21.549 --> 36:25.312
I... I can't.

36:55.681 --> 36:58.249
Is the chief your father?

37:00.318 --> 37:02.695
Why did you leave him?

37:02.820 --> 37:05.655

39:36.032 --> 39:37.129
Out of the way, Bohannon.

39:37.295 --> 39:39.340
We aim to go after the Injuns,

39:39.506 --> 39:41.536
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

39:43.171 --> 39:45.181
The hell there ain't.

39:45.306 --> 39:47.183
You're outnumbered.

39:47.308 --> 39:49.345
You can't kill us all, lad.

39:49.845 --> 39:51.855
Aw, I can kill about 5 of ya.

39:51.980 --> 39:54.858
You hear that? He's not
even fully loaded.

39:54.983 --> 39:58.360
Only 5 bullets he's got.

39:58.485 --> 40:00.694
I got 6 bullets...

40:00.860 --> 40:02.905
I was just gonna shoot you twice.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.269
Gentlemen?

40:07.394 --> 40:09.395
Yeah.

40:14.601 --> 40:16.645
There's still only two of you.

40:16.770 --> 40:24.553
Oh, I'd count again if I were you.

40:24.678 --> 40:28.047
You see, it's important
to Mr. Thomas Durant

40:28.384 --> 40:33.661
that the Injuns are not harmed.

40:33.786 --> 40:40.534
I'm sure you boys can find
some amusement here in town.

40:40.659 --> 40:42.945
Hmm?

40:50.802 --> 40:53.670
Let's go, boys.

40:54.505 --> 40:57.376
Careful now.

40:58.843 --> 41:00.086
We want Eva.

41:00.211 --> 41:01.620
The one the Injuns marked up.

41:01.745 --> 41:03.421
Well, you have to poke
another, she ain't here.

41:03.546 --> 41:05.357
Where is the heathen bitch?

41:05.482 --> 41:06.719
I don't know.

41:06.885 --> 41:08.554
I ain't seen her since
the train race.

41:10.921 --> 41:12.955
I know where to find her.

41:19.428 --> 41:21.896
Two peas in a pod.

41:24.900 --> 41:28.616
I say we go get her now!

41:28.782 --> 41:30.071
Just get dressed.

41:32.660 --> 41:34.017
