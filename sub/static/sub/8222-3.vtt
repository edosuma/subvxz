 that we're gonna test --

01:57.617 --> 01:59.651
 that every banana peel
 left on the ground

01:59.652 --> 02:01.553
 equals someone walking up to it

 NARRATOR:
 According to the laws of comedy,

02:12.365 --> 02:15.365
 a discarded banana peel
 is an unavoidable fall magnet.

 a guaranteed guffaw,

 Jamie slips into something

 if he's gonna slip.

 won't be able to see the peel,

 its hilarious revenge.

 And that's not quite the result

03:35.048 --> 03:37.149
 the guys were expecting.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.851
 So, I could feel the banana peel
 when I finally stepped on it,

03:39.852 --> 03:42.788
 but, you know,
 you feel something like that,

03:42.789 --> 03:44.022
 you compensate for it.

03:44.023 --> 03:46.491
 At no time did I feel
 like I was gonna lose it

03:46.492 --> 03:49.094

 end up on my butt.

03:49.095 --> 03:50.796
 NARRATOR: The Hyneman
 may be stealthy enough

03:50.797 --> 03:52.164
 to avoid one peel,

03:52.165 --> 03:55.165
 but surely
 there's no escaping a fall now.

04:15.154 --> 04:17.189
 I think what I need to do
 from here

04:17.190 --> 04:18.589
 is actually move quickly enough

04:18.591 --> 04:21.591
 that it doesn't matter whether
 I know it's coming or not.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.095
 If I slip, I'm gonna fall.

04:25.698 --> 04:28.698

 speed, there's still no banana.

04:31.037 --> 04:32.904
 Good job.
 Ohh!

04:32.905 --> 04:34.439
 It's not looking good
 for this myth.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.440
 -Can I take this off now?
 -Yes, you can.

04:38.678 --> 04:39.911

04:49.856 --> 04:51.757
 Nothing spectacular,
 even when running.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.592
 So I think we need to do
 some testing,

04:53.593 --> 04:56.593
 and find out just how slippery
 these things actually are

04:56.996 --> 04:59.996
 when compared
 to other "slippery" things.

05:00.099 --> 05:03.099
 NARRATOR: And that means
 it's time to get scientific.

05:03.836 --> 05:05.937
 ADAM:
 There's two kinds of friction

05:05.938 --> 05:07.239
 we want to look at here.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.807
 One is called static friction,

05:08.808 --> 05:10.909
 and that's from a stop
 to a start.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.910
 There's a secondary one which
 is dynamic, or kinetic friction,

05:14.681 --> 05:17.681
 which is how much resistance
 the banana peel has to moving,

05:18.184 --> 05:19.184
 while it's moving.

05:19.185 --> 05:22.185
 And I'm gonna build some rigs
 to test both

05:22.188 --> 05:25.188
 and compare banana peels
 to some other slippery things.

05:26.592 --> 05:28.327
 NARRATOR:
 Let's get this straight.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.795
 When you slip on a peel,

05:29.796 --> 05:32.230
 there are two types of friction
 in play.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.399
 First is the static friction,

05:34.400 --> 05:37.400
 which the banana peel
 must overcome to start moving.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.638
 And then, once in motion,

05:39.639 --> 05:42.639
 kinetic friction is the peel's
 resistance to sliding.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.811
 And first,
 to test static friction,

05:45.812 --> 05:47.913
 Adam's whipped up
 just the thing.

05:47.914 --> 05:50.914
 Let's start with this shoe
 and 4 pounds of weight in it,

05:51.384 --> 05:54.086
 and see what
 its static-friction angle is.

05:54.087 --> 05:54.820
 Okay.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.555
 10.

05:56.556 --> 05:57.756
 20.

05:57.757 --> 05:59.558
 45.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.860
 ADAM:
 45 degrees for the shoe.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.662
 NARRATOR:
 That's the control.

06:03.663 --> 06:05.931
 And with a banana peel?

06:05.932 --> 06:07.032
 JAMIE: 10.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.300
 15.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.302
 There it is.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.270
 Yep, 15 degrees.

06:12.271 --> 06:14.806
 NARRATOR: So the peel cuts
 the static friction

06:14.807 --> 06:16.475
 by a factor of three.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.877
 What's slicker
 than a banana peel?

06:18.878 --> 06:20.145
 Well, I happen to have

06:20.146 --> 06:23.146
 some animal birthing agent
 laying around.

06:23.182 --> 06:24.383
 [ Laughs ]

06:24.384 --> 06:27.384
 NARRATOR: By comparing them
 with this super-slick lube,

06:27.387 --> 06:30.222
 the boys can work out
 where the banana peels sit

06:30.223 --> 06:33.223
 on the, uh, slipperiness scale.

06:33.693 --> 06:34.893
 ADAM: Okay.

 I was gonna stop it,
 but I didn't want to touch it.

06:44.370 --> 06:47.370
 NARRATOR: The physics of this
 slapstick myth are looking good.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.740
 Surprisingly, the static
 friction of the banana peel

06:51.210 --> 06:53.278
 is lower than the lube.

06:53.279 --> 06:56.014
 However, there's one more thing
 to test,

06:56.015 --> 06:58.383
 and that's the kinetic friction.

06:58.384 --> 07:00.786
 This is a device
 for measuring just that --

07:00.787 --> 07:02.988
 the amount of force it takes
 to pull it

07:02.989 --> 07:05.557
 once you've overcome
 the static friction.

07:05.558 --> 07:08.393
 NARRATOR: Once again,
 the shoe is their baseline.

07:08.394 --> 07:11.394
 Jamie gives it a, uh, nudge
 to get it moving.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.500
 I'd call it about 14 pounds.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.369
 That looks about right to me.

07:17.370 --> 07:20.370
 NARRATOR: But with the banana
 peel, that number halves.

07:22.909 --> 07:24.910
 7 pounds.

07:24.911 --> 07:25.911
 [ Laughs ]

 That is nasty.

07:29.315 --> 07:32.250
 -And... go.
 -ADAM: Go for it.

07:32.251 --> 07:35.187
 That was consistently 5
 across the whole thing.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.322
 NARRATOR:
 So that takes care of the data.

07:37.323 --> 07:39.291
 But what does it all mean?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.292
 ADAM: The banana peel is not the
 slipperiest thing we could find.

07:42.361 --> 07:44.296
 We found some lubricant
 that's actually slipperier,

07:44.297 --> 07:47.297
 but the banana peel
 did respectably.

07:47.333 --> 07:50.068

 we can call this one

09:36.075 --> 09:37.809
 and have a little competition?

09:37.810 --> 09:40.178
 Okay, well, in that case,
 let's make it winner takes all.

09:40.179 --> 09:42.647
 Whoever makes the most diamonds
 with the greatest value

09:42.648 --> 09:44.049
 keeps everything.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.917
 I like a good competition.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.586
 I'm gonna put my hand up
 for peanut butter.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.088
 All right, well, I'll
 investigate the "CSI" method.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.089
 Well, I guess that leaves me
 with the iron and graphite.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.259
 But watch out, 'cause I'm gonna
 blow you away with my bling.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.263
 Oh, yeah?

09:58.264 --> 10:00.832
 Well, I guess the proof...

10:00.833 --> 10:02.567
...is in the pudding.

10:02.568 --> 10:05.136
 NARRATOR:
 Tory's come over all "CSI,"

10:05.137 --> 10:08.137
 which is apt, given that
 this myth will have murder...

10:08.474 --> 10:10.542
 -KARI: Dead.
 -Burn!

10:10.543 --> 10:13.044
 NARRATOR:
...double dealing...

10:13.045 --> 10:14.579
...plenty of shocks...

10:14.580 --> 10:15.647
 Uhh!

10:15.648 --> 10:18.648
 NARRATOR:... and the mother
 of all climaxes.

10:22.688 --> 10:25.688
 "CSI: Miami"
 makes it look so easy.

10:26.058 --> 10:29.058
 According to the crime lab,
 all you need is pure graphite,

10:29.862 --> 10:32.862
 a ceramic box,
 some mysterious chemicals,

10:33.265 --> 10:35.200
 and a pressure cooker.

10:35.201 --> 10:38.201
 Then, after three days,
 hey, presto.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.838
 But is this technique...

10:39.839 --> 10:42.839
 It's like nature,
 only a million times faster.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.176
 NARRATOR:
...or is it like science,

10:45.177 --> 10:48.177
 only a million times fabricated?

10:48.914 --> 10:51.914
 For an expert opinion,
 Tory heads to U.C. Berkeley

10:52.051 --> 10:54.319
 to see Dr. Michael Franklock.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.353
 So, if I was gonna do this,

10:55.354 --> 10:57.222
 what kind of chemicals
 do you think I should use?

10:57.223 --> 10:59.891
 Metals like nickel,
 cobalt, and iron,

10:59.892 --> 11:02.694
 so I would advise you
 to start from one of those,

11:02.695 --> 11:04.596
 and it should be salt
 in its active form.

11:04.597 --> 11:07.065
 You still need to add
 some initial seeds,

11:07.066 --> 11:09.167
 initial -- some small diamonds.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.569
 So you need a little piece
 of diamond to start the diamond?

11:11.570 --> 11:13.505
 If you already start
 with a little seed,

11:13.506 --> 11:16.506
 even of poor quality,
 it can grow and get bigger.

11:17.877 --> 11:19.678
 NARRATOR:
 Dr. Franklock's advice

11:19.679 --> 11:22.147
 has given Tory
 the competitive edge,

11:22.148 --> 11:25.148
 and while he's off to gather
 his "CSI" supplies...

11:25.284 --> 11:27.352
 TORY:
 That is the pressure pot.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.254
 NARRATOR:
...Kari weighs in with a recipe

11:29.255 --> 11:32.023
 that puts the nuts
 into peanut butter.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.024
 KARI: To turn ordinary
 peanut butter into diamonds,

11:35.027 --> 11:37.529
 there's a very simple recipe
 all over the Internet.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.197
 You take
 two charcoal briquettes,

11:39.198 --> 11:42.198
 you cover them with 4 ounces
 of peanut butter,

11:42.601 --> 11:44.302
 put them
 in a microwave-safe dish,

11:44.303 --> 11:47.303
 and then you microwave them
 for 60 minutes

11:47.373 --> 11:50.373
 in 1 0-minute increments.

11:50.409 --> 11:51.910
 NARRATOR:
 Sounds crazy,

11:51.911 --> 11:54.179
 but according
 to these Internet hipsters...

11:54.180 --> 11:56.681
 You want to take about
 4 ounces of peanut butter.

11:56.682 --> 11:58.450
 NARRATOR:
...all that stands between you

11:58.451 --> 12:01.451
 and millions of dollars
 is a microwave.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.322
 Still, unsurprisingly,

12:04.323 --> 12:07.323
 after just five minutes on high,
 things go up in smoke.

12:08.994 --> 12:11.196
 KARI: Looks like I'll be getting
 some more glassware

12:11.197 --> 12:14.197
 and trying this again,
 because I want my diamonds!

12:17.169 --> 12:19.738
 NARRATOR:
 Eventually, three attempts,

12:19.739 --> 12:22.340
 three dishes,
 and two microwaves later,

12:22.341 --> 12:25.043
 Kari has her alleged
 diamonds in the rough.

12:25.044 --> 12:26.845
 KARI: I don't think I see
 any diamonds yet.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.846
 But we have
 one more process to go.

12:29.949 --> 12:32.949
 NARRATOR: And that process is
 to burn off the excess carbon.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.055
 KARI: When they say
 diamonds are forever,

12:37.056 --> 12:40.056
 they mean they take forever
 to create.

12:40.726 --> 12:43.726
 NARRATOR: Well, patience
 is a virtue, but does it pay?

12:44.697 --> 12:46.931
 Maybe the diamonds
 are microscopic,

12:46.932 --> 12:49.434
 but they're supposed
 to be the size of fennel seeds.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.669
 I'm not seeing them so far.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.239
 I am seeing a lot
 of burnt peanut butter.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.875
 NARRATOR: Still, Kari's not
 out of the contest yet.

12:56.876 --> 12:59.544
 She can't tell the diamonds
 from the dirt,

12:59.545 --> 13:02.545
 but maybe an expert can.

13:04.650 --> 13:07.552
 MAN: [ Laughs ]

13:07.553 --> 13:10.553
 NARRATOR: Everyone knows monkeys
 go ape for bananas.

13:11.757 --> 13:14.757
 They're a delicious treat
 for primates and people alike.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.762
 But in slapstick comedy,

13:17.763 --> 13:20.763
 the banana serves
 a more sinister purpose.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.500
 But while you can lead a Hyneman
 to a banana skin,

13:25.571 --> 13:27.806
 you can't make him fall.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.807
 So now the boys
 are upping the ante

13:30.876 --> 13:32.710
 on this banana-peel myth.

13:32.711 --> 13:35.313
 We expect that we're gonna be
 falling down a lot.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.948
 So with that in mind,

13:36.949 --> 13:39.617
 we're building a special floor
 so we don't hurt ourselves.

13:39.618 --> 13:41.152
 And this is what it's made of.

13:41.153 --> 13:44.153
 ADAM: These springy tires
 are layer one

13:44.190 --> 13:46.357
 of our sprung floor.

13:46.358 --> 13:49.358
 All this wood right here
 is layer two.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.496
 And this linoleum here --
 This is layer three.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.403
 NARRATOR:
 The boys have busted their gut,

13:58.404 --> 14:01.404
 and now they have the perfect
 venue for busting their butt.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.343
 This may look like
 a completed sprung floor,

14:05.344 --> 14:06.845
 but, in fact,
 it's missing one element,

14:06.846 --> 14:09.047
 which is banana peels.

14:09.048 --> 14:11.916
 Hundreds and hundreds
 and hundreds of banana peels.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.284
 We're gonna lay them out here

14:13.285 --> 14:15.954
 like an obstacle course
 of comedy death,

14:15.955 --> 14:18.955
 and then we're gonna run
 a little like this.

14:22.161 --> 14:23.928
 -Goal!
 -NARRATOR: That's right.

14:23.929 --> 14:26.331
 They're throwing
 this banana-peel myth

14:26.332 --> 14:29.332
 one last lifeline,
 with the ultimate test.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.703
 We've got a truckload full
 of bananas,

14:31.704 --> 14:33.605
 and we have our rink set up.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.606
 Only thing now is that we need
 to peel all these bananas,

14:36.742 --> 14:39.742
 so we either need a whole lot
 of monkeys or some volunteers.

14:40.946 --> 14:43.848
 NARRATOR: Well, the monkeys
 had a prior engagement,

14:43.849 --> 14:46.651
 so the guys settle
 for the volunteers.

14:46.652 --> 14:49.652
 I'm gonna place eight
 of these cones on the rink,

14:49.655 --> 14:51.656
 each one with a raw egg on top.

14:51.657 --> 14:54.392
 Our task will be to gather up
 all eight raw eggs

14:54.393 --> 14:56.327
 running back and forth, back
 and forth, back and forth

14:56.328 --> 14:59.328
 as fast as we can without --
 I can't break this egg!

15:01.200 --> 15:02.367
 [ Laughs ]

15:02.368 --> 15:03.968
 And when we're all done,

15:03.969 --> 15:06.571
 we ring the bell,
 and that stops the timer.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.572
 NARRATOR:
 With the rink now full...

15:09.808 --> 15:11.609
...Jamie's keister
 is well padded,

15:11.610 --> 15:14.610
 as this test should give
 the peels the best chance

15:14.613 --> 15:17.613
 to redeem
 their slapstick reputation.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.018
 But if he doesn't fall
 on his butt,

15:20.019 --> 15:21.786
 then this myth is busted.

15:21.787 --> 15:24.656
 Okay, banana-peel speed test.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.690
 Are you ready?

 [ Ding ]

15:29.295 --> 15:32.295
 [ Laughs ]
 5 seconds!

15:36.769 --> 15:38.736
 15 seconds.

15:38.737 --> 15:40.371
 He's not falling down.

15:40.372 --> 15:41.839
 NARRATOR:
 He's done it again.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.840
 Jamie's gravity-defying powers
 are spooky.

15:48.914 --> 15:49.781
 [ Ding ]

15:49.782 --> 15:51.316
 ADAM:
 40 seconds!

15:51.317 --> 15:54.317
 Nicely done.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.355
 Of course this test
 isn't about Adam and I racing.

15:57.356 --> 16:00.258
 It's about how slippery
 banana peels are.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.392
 And they are.

16:01.393 --> 16:04.393
 I had to be really, really
 careful not to slide,

16:04.596 --> 16:07.596
 and even then,
 I slid quite a bit.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.400
 NARRATOR: But that caution
 invalidated Jamie's test,

16:11.904 --> 16:14.272
 because according
 to the laws of comedy,

16:14.273 --> 16:16.507
 he shouldn't be expecting
 to fall.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.508
 So for a repeat performance,
 he takes off the brakes.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.447
 JAMIE:
 Okay, Jamie on turbo.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.448
 [ Ding ]

16:25.818 --> 16:27.352
 NARRATOR:
 At long last,

16:27.353 --> 16:30.353
 the banana peels
 take their revenge...

16:31.490 --> 16:34.490
 And although he valiantly
 attempts to recover...

16:36.028 --> 16:37.662
 Go, go, go!

 overcome the giggles.

16:47.139 --> 16:49.240
 I've never seen him like that.

16:49.241 --> 16:52.241
 NARRATOR: And with no complete
 data, it's all down to Adam.

16:53.579 --> 16:56.579
 ADAM: Okay, this is
 Adam's banana-peel speed test

16:57.216 --> 16:59.450

17:18.537 --> 17:21.172
 That was so much fun!

17:21.173 --> 17:24.173
 NARRATOR: That's six falls
 in less than a minute,

17:24.742 --> 17:27.742
 which means that this myth
 is back in plausible territory.

17:29.348 --> 17:32.348
 The real question is, how
 do they compare against, like,

17:32.484 --> 17:34.085
 the ultimate slipperiness?

17:34.086 --> 17:37.086
 And that's pretty much what
 the next test is all about.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.359
 NARRATOR:
 Planet Earth is a violent place,

17:41.360 --> 17:44.262
 and, deep below ground,
 it gets worse.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.397
 Here, immense heat and pressure

17:46.398 --> 17:49.398
 transform carbon
 into a girl's best friend.

17:49.935 --> 17:52.935
 But perhaps that's not
 the only way to make diamonds.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.239
 Well, the Mythbusters
 are competing to find out.

17:57.643 --> 17:59.977
 Kari's chances appear slim.

17:59.978 --> 18:01.679
 I don't think I see
 any diamonds yet.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.581
 NARRATOR:
 But Tory's done his research,

18:03.582 --> 18:05.216
 and he now has a solid lead

18:05.217 --> 18:08.217
 on that annoyingly vague
 "CSI" recipe.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.687
 Now, I have everything I need
 to start making diamonds.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.058
 First, I have
 my pressure cooker.

18:14.059 --> 18:15.226
 I have my ingredients.

18:15.227 --> 18:17.728
 I have my hunk of graphite.

18:17.729 --> 18:20.729
 The chemical that I'm gonna use
 is ferric nitrate.

18:20.966 --> 18:23.966
 What I'm gonna do is stick this
 and that in this,

18:27.239 --> 18:28.539
 put it in that.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.309
 NARRATOR: And that's as specific
 as it gets.

18:31.310 --> 18:34.145
 But let's not forget
 the most important ingredient --

18:34.146 --> 18:35.546
 a diamond seed.

18:35.547 --> 18:38.547
 Without it, this recipe
 has no chance of working.

18:39.184 --> 18:42.184
 For, uh, safety,
 Tory rigs a stun gun...

18:43.989 --> 18:45.857
 It's been a while
 since we used one of these,

18:45.858 --> 18:47.225
 and I kind of forget
 what it feels like.

 -[ Buzzes ]
 -Aghh!

18:49.328 --> 18:52.328
 NARRATOR:... and lights the gas
 from outside the bunker.

18:53.031 --> 18:54.565
 TORY: I'll leave it there
 for three days,

18:54.566 --> 18:56.367
 and then at the end of that,

18:56.368 --> 18:58.136
 check and see if I've made
 any diamonds.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.938
 NARRATOR:
 And while Tory waits,

19:00.939 --> 19:03.939
 Grant's off to the blacksmith
 for his shot at diamonds.

19:04.776 --> 19:07.776
 So, to execute this diamond
 recipe, we need to melt iron,

19:08.380 --> 19:10.414
 and to do that,
 you need a foundry.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.483
 We don't have a foundry
 at Mythbusters,

19:12.484 --> 19:15.353
 but we've come to a place
 that does have a foundry,

19:15.354 --> 19:16.687
 the Crucible.

19:16.688 --> 19:19.688
 NARRATOR: Supposedly this recipe
 replicates the heat and pressure

19:20.425 --> 19:22.326
 that make natural diamonds.

19:22.327 --> 19:25.327
 All you need to do is melt
 graphite into molten iron

19:25.764 --> 19:27.165
 and quench the mixture.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.166
 Then just dissolve the iron
 in acid, and voilÃ !

19:31.069 --> 19:34.069
 Your very own
 sparkling gemstones.

19:34.473 --> 19:36.941
 So to get this recipe fired up,

19:36.942 --> 19:39.942
 Grant enlists master smelter,
 Nick DiPhillipo.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.547
 GRANT:
 All right.

19:42.548 --> 19:44.348
 -Here you go.
 -Thank you.

19:44.349 --> 19:47.118
 NARRATOR: The graphite and iron
 go into the furnace,

19:47.119 --> 19:50.119
 to be heated to 2,500 degrees.

19:55.460 --> 19:58.095
 Burn! Burn!

19:58.096 --> 20:00.364
 Make me diamonds!

20:00.365 --> 20:01.832
 [ Laughs evilly ]

20:01.833 --> 20:03.367
 NARRATOR:
 And at that heat,

20:03.368 --> 20:05.002
 Grant's stretching the rules

20:05.003 --> 20:08.003
 of the homemade-diamonds contest
 just a touch.

20:09.641 --> 20:12.641
 But after 20 minutes,
 it's the moment of truth.

20:13.345 --> 20:14.845
 So, this is it.
 Now the pour, right?

20:14.846 --> 20:16.247
 Yep, here we go.

20:16.248 --> 20:19.183
 There's the iron.

20:19.184 --> 20:21.185
 NARRATOR:
 As the iron hits the water,

20:21.186 --> 20:22.687
 the contraction of the metal

20:22.688 --> 20:25.523
 should apparently
 be forming diamonds.

20:25.524 --> 20:28.025
 And after waiting
 for the iron to cool,

20:28.026 --> 20:30.428
 it's time to harvest the spoils.

20:30.429 --> 20:33.331
 I'm rich!
 I'm gonna be rich!

20:33.332 --> 20:36.332
 Finally this gig's
 really paying off.

20:36.668 --> 20:39.303
 NARRATOR: Okay, Grant
 could be onto a winner,

20:39.304 --> 20:42.304
 so, booty in tow, he heads home
 to iron out the details.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.743
 The idea is that at this point,

20:48.013 --> 20:50.781
 your diamonds
 have already been made.

20:50.782 --> 20:53.150
 It's just that they're encased
 in this iron,

20:53.151 --> 20:56.151
 and you have to get the iron off
 in order to get the diamonds.

20:56.622 --> 20:59.423
 NARRATOR: And Grant's
 not just outside for the view.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.625
 The iron stripper

21:00.626 --> 21:03.626
 is super-concentrated
 hydrochloric acid.

21:03.962 --> 21:06.962
 But first impressions
 are a little disappointing.

21:07.299 --> 21:10.299
 There's bubbles aplenty,
 but not a glimmer of glitz.

21:11.003 --> 21:14.003
 Right now, it looks
 like a roiling soup

21:14.673 --> 21:17.673
 of butternut squash,
 but not quite that appetizing.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.345
 There's got to be a fortune
 in there somewhere.

21:21.346 --> 21:24.346
 NARRATOR: Well, Grant,
 anything's possible.

21:25.517 --> 21:28.517
 So, I've let my iron dissolve
 overnight in the acid,

21:30.789 --> 21:33.789
 and now it's time
 to harvest my diamonds.

21:34.359 --> 21:36.994
 NARRATOR:
 Grant neutralizes the acid,

21:36.995 --> 21:39.995
 but the results are low
 on sparkle.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.600
 I think what we're gonna have
 to do is take this somewhere

21:42.601 --> 21:45.601
 where they can see if there's
 a diamond hidden somewhere...

21:46.605 --> 21:47.838
...in the rough.

21:47.839 --> 21:50.839
 NARRATOR: If they're in there,
 they're hidden well.

21:55.781 --> 21:58.683
 The Mythbusters are tackling
 the slapstick favorite --

21:58.684 --> 22:01.684
 slipping on a banana peel.

22:02.187 --> 22:03.854
 ADAM: 37.
 Come on!

22:03.855 --> 22:06.855
 NARRATOR: And while the skins
 certainly are slippery,

22:07.326 --> 22:09.627
 the fun ain't over yet.

22:09.628 --> 22:10.428
 Whoa!

22:10.429 --> 22:12.530
 We wanted to compare
 the slipperiness of bananas

22:12.531 --> 22:14.598
 to something that was
 ultimately slippery,

22:14.599 --> 22:17.599
 and we went looking,
 and we found this lubricant.

22:17.769 --> 22:20.471
 It's used to help animals
 give birth.

22:20.472 --> 22:22.106
 We're gonna spread it out
 on this field,

22:22.107 --> 22:24.008
 and hilarity will ensue.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.009
 NARRATOR: By comparing the peels
 to the ultraslick lube,

22:27.346 --> 22:29.547
 the guys can find out
 just how slippery

22:29.548 --> 22:32.016
 a banana peel really is.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.017
 Okay, commencing the slime.

22:36.088 --> 22:39.088
 NARRATOR: After a quick squirt,
 the rink is ready for testing,

22:40.459 --> 22:43.294
 and by now,
 well, you know the drill.

22:43.295 --> 22:46.295
 JAMIE:
 Superduper lube, starting.

22:46.498 --> 22:47.898
 Come on, now 

22:47.899 --> 22:50.768
 And scream 

22:50.769 --> 22:53.704
 NARRATOR: And it's a hop,
 a skid, and a thud

22:53.705 --> 22:56.574
 till the lube takes Jamie out.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.008
 ADAM: [ Laughs ]

 [ Boing! ]

23:10.088 --> 23:11.489
 ADAM: [ Laughs ]

23:11.490 --> 23:13.524
 NARRATOR:
 That's only two falls for Jamie,

23:13.525 --> 23:15.726
 but since he didn't
 finish bananas,

23:15.727 --> 23:18.696
 it's down to Adam
 for the final test.

23:18.697 --> 23:20.698
 -Be careful, little buddy.
 -Okay.

23:35.380 --> 23:36.947
 [Bleep] [ Laughs ]

23:36.948 --> 23:38.682
 NARRATOR:
 That's fall number one,

23:38.683 --> 23:41.683
 and I think the tally
 should take it from here.

23:42.687 --> 23:45.687
 Oh! Ooh!

23:50.996 --> 23:53.197
 [ Boing! ]

23:55.200 --> 23:56.534
 What was my time?

23:56.535 --> 23:58.235
 1 minute, 20 seconds.

23:58.236 --> 24:00.004
 That was no faking, man.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.239
 It gets worse
 the farther you go.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.240
 [ Laughs ]

24:03.241 --> 24:05.543
 NARRATOR:
 Clearly, with two more tumbles

24:05.544 --> 24:07.611
 and an extra 30 seconds
 on the clock,

24:07.612 --> 24:10.612
 falling down with the lube
 was practically compulsory.

24:12.150 --> 24:15.150
 If I had to give it a rating,
 I'd call our birthing agent a 9.

24:15.353 --> 24:17.621
 I could conceive
 of something more slippery,

24:17.622 --> 24:20.024
 like a field of roller skates,

24:20.025 --> 24:23.025
 but within that, I'd say
 that bananas were easily a 6.

24:24.095 --> 24:25.729
 So, how do you want to call
 this one?

24:25.730 --> 24:28.332
 Well, what exactly was the myth
 we started out with?

24:28.333 --> 24:29.900
 Okay, according
 to the laws of comedy,

24:29.901 --> 24:31.969
 the myth is that one banana peel
 plus one person

24:31.970 --> 24:34.405
 equals one person on their butt.

24:34.406 --> 24:36.006
 Well, then we'd have
 to call it busted,

24:36.007 --> 24:38.909
 because a banana peel
 was definitely not a guarantee

24:38.910 --> 24:40.044
 that you were gonna fall.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.346
 But I do have to say
 that with their leathery top

24:42.347 --> 24:44.582
 and that permanently
 lubricated underside,

24:44.583 --> 24:46.484
 they're perfect for slipping on.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.786
 I'd say this is busted,
 but only just.

24:48.787 --> 24:51.787
 Agreed.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.927
 NARRATOR: The "Banana-Peel Flip"
 may be busted,

24:56.928 --> 24:59.928
 but the guys are taking a bite
 out of something else.

25:00.765 --> 25:02.066
 I've got a good one.

25:02.067 --> 25:04.068
 -Yeah, what's that?
 -Double dipping.

25:04.069 --> 25:07.069
 Oh, that you can't dip, bite,
 and dip in a second time

25:08.139 --> 25:10.074
 -like in "Seinfeld."
 -Exactly.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.976
 The myth's been around
 for a lot longer than that,

25:11.977 --> 25:13.544
 but "Seinfeld" popularized it.

25:13.545 --> 25:15.846
 If I remember correctly,
 when George is accused

25:15.847 --> 25:17.147
 of double dipping,

25:17.148 --> 25:19.517
 the guy tells him that dipping,
 biting, and dipping again

25:19.518 --> 25:22.518
 is akin to putting his whole
 mouth in the bowl of dip.

25:24.489 --> 25:26.891
 NARRATOR:
 It's a classic "Seinfeld" moment

25:26.892 --> 25:29.159
 that the fans
 have begged us to test.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.594
 An unwitting George

25:30.595 --> 25:32.329
 -finds himself...
 -What are you doing?

25:32.330 --> 25:34.298
 NARRATOR:... breaking
 dip-dunking etiquette.

25:34.299 --> 25:35.232
 What?

25:35.233 --> 25:38.233
 Did -- Did you just
 double dip that chip?

25:39.237 --> 25:41.405
 -Excuse me?
 -You double dipped the chip!

25:41.406 --> 25:44.406
 NARRATOR: By dipping the chip
 twice, supposedly...

25:44.643 --> 25:47.244
 That's like putting your
 whole mouth right in the dip!

25:47.245 --> 25:49.380
 NARRATOR:
 Is this bacterial baloney,

25:49.381 --> 25:52.349
 or is there something
 to this "Seinfeld" saga?

25:52.350 --> 25:55.152
 Just take one dip and end it!

25:55.153 --> 25:57.621
 NARRATOR: The theory is
 that double dipping

25:57.622 --> 26:00.622
 transfers microbes
 from your mouth into the dip

26:00.725 --> 26:02.626
 and then on to other people.

26:02.627 --> 26:04.895
 But can the germs
 inside your mouth

26:04.896 --> 26:07.896
 really hitch a ride
 on your chip of choice?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.000
 So, what's your plan
 on this one?

26:10.001 --> 26:11.802
 Well, we've got some chips,
 we've got some dip,

26:11.803 --> 26:13.871
 and I think it's time to
 bring back our old friends,

26:13.872 --> 26:15.205
 the petri dishes.

26:15.206 --> 26:18.142
 So, we'll do a control.
 we'll do double dipping.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.311
 Then we've got to put
 our whole mouths in the bowl.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.745
 We'll get separate bowls.

26:21.746 --> 26:23.147
 -You want separate bowls?
 -Yeah.

26:23.148 --> 26:24.415
 Okay.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.050
 NARRATOR:
 Separate bowls, it is.

26:26.051 --> 26:28.819
 And with a bunch
 of soy agar petri dishes

26:28.820 --> 26:30.654
 primed for bacterial growth,

26:30.655 --> 26:33.624
 it's time to double dip
 for science.

26:33.625 --> 26:34.992
 We've got two kinds of dip --

26:34.993 --> 26:37.428
 a cream-based dip, a salsa-based
 dip, and a bowlful of chips.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.063
 Let me tell you how we're
 gonna do this experiment.

26:39.064 --> 26:42.064
 First, before we touch anything,
 we're going to stick a swab

26:42.367 --> 26:43.867
 in each of these kinds of dips

26:43.868 --> 26:46.770
 and put them on an agar plate
 and try and culture them.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.405
 That's our control.

26:48.406 --> 26:50.574
 Then we're gonna double dip
 in these dips.

26:50.575 --> 26:52.643
 Dip, bite, dip again.

26:52.644 --> 26:55.412
 Once we've done that,
 we're gonna culture them again

26:55.413 --> 26:58.382
 and see if we've added
 any bacteria.

26:58.383 --> 27:00.250
 But the story
 includes a third wrinkle,

27:00.251 --> 27:01.819
 in which the guy says
 that double dipping

27:01.820 --> 27:04.688
 is like putting your whole mouth
 into the bowl.

27:04.689 --> 27:05.756
 So we're gonna do that.

27:05.757 --> 27:08.525
 We're gonna take as much of the
 dip in our mouths as possible.

27:08.526 --> 27:09.627
 It's gonna be really gross.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.928
 we're gonna spit it back out,

27:10.929 --> 27:12.696
 and we're gonna culture it
 one last time

27:12.697 --> 27:15.697
 and see if that's equivalent
 to double dipping.

27:16.034 --> 27:18.235
 NARRATOR:
 And it really is that simple.

27:18.236 --> 27:21.071
 With each Mythbuster
 swabbing three experiments,

27:21.072 --> 27:24.041
 they're ready to incubate.

27:24.042 --> 27:26.610
 ADAM: Perfect.
 It's right around 98 degrees.

27:26.611 --> 27:29.346
 So we want it right about the
 same as the human body, huh?

27:29.347 --> 27:31.281
 Yeah.
 For roughly a day.

27:31.282 --> 27:32.750
 We'll come back tomorrow
 and check it out.

27:32.751 --> 27:33.584
 Okay.

27:33.585 --> 27:36.585
 NARRATOR: And thanks
 to the wonders of editing...

27:36.888 --> 27:39.390
...time's up
 for the breeding bacteria.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.925
 The biohazards are ready
 for their close-up.

27:41.926 --> 27:44.926
 But there's a problem.

27:45.830 --> 27:46.830
 That's the control.

27:46.831 --> 27:49.831
 And there's already bacteria
 in the salsa.

27:50.368 --> 27:52.903
 NARRATOR: They check
 all the salsa-only controls,

27:52.904 --> 27:55.904
 and every one
 tells the same story.

27:56.741 --> 27:59.410
 Even with no human saliva,

27:59.411 --> 28:02.379
 the dips are already brimming
 with bugs.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.948
 Clearly, we are going to need to
 do this test again

28:04.949 --> 28:07.284
 and remove some variables.

28:07.285 --> 28:10.285
 NARRATOR: Yep, with the controls
 showing more bacterial growth

28:10.321 --> 28:13.321
 than Adam's feet, the boys
 are going to need a plan "B".

28:18.029 --> 28:19.830
 The Mythbusters
 are battling it out

28:19.831 --> 28:22.566
 making homegrown diamonds,

28:22.567 --> 28:25.567
 and, so far, their crusade
 is a little short on bling.

28:26.638 --> 28:29.273
 There's got to be a fortune
 in there somewhere.

28:29.274 --> 28:32.274
 NARRATOR:
 But Tory's not finished yet.

28:34.212 --> 28:37.014
 His "CSI" recipe was simple --

28:37.015 --> 28:40.015
 just graphite and chemicals
 inside a pressure cooker,

28:40.452 --> 28:42.853
 and in three days,
 he'll have a rock.

28:42.854 --> 28:45.854
 So, was it a recipe for success?

28:46.558 --> 28:49.026
 All right,
 so it's been three days,

28:49.027 --> 28:51.295
 and now it's time
 to check my diamonds.

28:51.296 --> 28:54.296
 The real question is, what am
 I gonna do with all my money

28:54.566 --> 28:56.734
 once I start my diamond company?

28:56.735 --> 28:59.735
 NARRATOR: I wouldn't count
 your diamonds just yet, Tory.

29:00.638 --> 29:03.307
 Oh, my gosh!

29:03.308 --> 29:06.308
 The graphite has not turned
 into a diamond.

29:07.278 --> 29:10.278
 Looks like my diamond business
 is not going so well.

29:11.382 --> 29:14.382
 NARRATOR: Which means there's
 no clear homegrown winner.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.588
 So, for an expert adjudication,

29:17.589 --> 29:20.589
 the team heads to U.C. Berkeley
 to see Dr. Kent Ross

29:21.259 --> 29:24.194
 and his electron microscope.

29:24.195 --> 29:27.195
 First up is Grant's
 iron and graphite.

29:28.399 --> 29:31.399
 Nothing that I'm seeing
 now has a shape

29:31.703 --> 29:34.703
 that says
 this has to be a diamond.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.574
 NARRATOR:
 Grant's out of contention.

29:37.575 --> 29:40.575
 So next is Kari's
 peanut-butter dirt.

29:40.879 --> 29:42.813
 Charcoal.
 You've got charcoal.

29:42.814 --> 29:45.814
 NARRATOR: Which leaves only Tory
 and his diamond seed.

29:46.651 --> 29:48.352
 DR. ROSS: The straight edges
 from the cut faces

29:48.353 --> 29:49.953
 are still perfectly smooth.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.954
 It's just like it was when you
 started your experiment.

29:53.758 --> 29:56.727
 NARRATOR: There's been
 no growth whatsoever,

29:56.728 --> 29:59.728
 and that's game over --
 no diamonds, nobody wins.

30:00.832 --> 30:03.367
 But where does that leave
 the myth?

30:03.368 --> 30:04.835
 So, we all tried
 making diamonds,

30:04.836 --> 30:06.403
 and we all failed miserably.

30:06.404 --> 30:07.638
 Yeah, I think it's safe to say

30:07.639 --> 30:09.773
 that all of these recipes
 are busted.

30:09.774 --> 30:12.009
 -Totally busted.
 -But you know what?

30:12.010 --> 30:14.278
 Our researchers
 have come up with someone

30:14.279 --> 30:17.279
 who can make diamonds
 in a Mythbuster way.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.083
 -Cool.
 -You guys remember Van Romero?

30:20.084 --> 30:21.251
 From New Mexico Tech.

30:21.252 --> 30:23.353
 He says he can make
 synthetic diamonds,

30:23.354 --> 30:25.455
 and he wants to show us how.

30:25.456 --> 30:26.957
 Awesome.
 What are we waiting for?

30:26.958 --> 30:28.792
 NARRATOR:
 So, for a proper chance

30:28.793 --> 30:30.828
 at making some bona fide bling,

30:30.829 --> 30:33.564
 the Mythbusters head
 to New Mexico Institute

30:33.565 --> 30:36.565
 of Mining and Technology
 to meet Dr. Van Romero.

30:37.735 --> 30:39.169
 Van, we heard you know
 how to make diamonds.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.804
 You've come to the right place.

30:40.805 --> 30:42.005
 Here at New Mexico Tech,

30:42.006 --> 30:44.408
 we do applied research,
 and we do industrial research.

30:44.409 --> 30:45.709
 And part
 of that industrial research

30:45.710 --> 30:47.778
 -is actually making diamonds.
 -GRANT: All right, well...

30:47.779 --> 30:48.779
 cut to the chase.

30:48.780 --> 30:49.847
 Tell us how to do it.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.381
 You know what,
 instead of telling you how,

30:51.382 --> 30:52.449
 let's show you how to do it.

30:52.450 --> 30:53.750
 -Even better.
 -Okay!

30:53.751 --> 30:56.751
 Let's go do it.

30:56.955 --> 30:59.955
 NARRATOR: Step one
 of Van's mysterious method

30:59.958 --> 31:02.958
 involves driving
 into the middle of nowhere.

31:03.027 --> 31:06.027
 Step two involves arriving
 at an almighty bunker.

31:07.432 --> 31:10.432
 And as for step three,
 well, Tory's one step ahead.

31:12.136 --> 31:14.638
 Considering we're standing
 outside of a bunker,

31:14.639 --> 31:17.639
 my feeling is it probably
 involves explosives,

31:17.742 --> 31:19.810
 which is never a bad thing.

31:19.811 --> 31:22.646
 NARRATOR:
 Tory's got it in one.

31:22.647 --> 31:25.647
 Van the Man reckons he can
 make bling with a boom.

31:27.185 --> 31:29.086
 And not just any boom,

31:29.087 --> 31:32.087
 but the biggest boom
 in Mythbusters history.

31:32.790 --> 31:34.791
 NARRATOR:
 In "Blackpowder Shark"...

31:34.792 --> 31:35.626
 KARI:... 1.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.060
 [ All screaming ]

31:37.061 --> 31:38.962
 NARRATOR:
.. .400 pounds of explosives

31:38.963 --> 31:41.598
 turned Hugo into Hu-Gone.

31:41.599 --> 31:44.599
 In "22,000 Foot Fall"...

31:45.003 --> 31:48.003
.. .500 pounds made
 a train station turn torpedo.

31:49.474 --> 31:52.474
 And in "Cement Mix Up"...

31:52.810 --> 31:55.810
.. .800 pounds made
 a truck take flight.

31:56.114 --> 31:59.114
 But all will be eclipsed
 right here, right now.

32:00.118 --> 32:03.118
 Because at ground zero,
 500 yards from the bunker,

32:03.855 --> 32:06.855
 Van's team are packing
 a 20-foot-high wooden tube

32:08.126 --> 32:11.126
 with 5,000 pounds
 of high explosives.

32:12.397 --> 32:15.397
 But can a bang this big
 really create diamonds?

32:15.967 --> 32:17.534
 Okay, you guys ready to make
 some diamonds?

32:17.535 --> 32:18.368
 Yeah!

32:18.369 --> 32:19.736
 MAN:
 Fire in the hole!

32:19.737 --> 32:21.204
 NARRATOR:
 Strap yourself in.

32:21.205 --> 32:24.205
 This one's going to be gigantic.

32:24.375 --> 32:27.375
 Charging.. .5, 4, 3, 2, 1,

32:29.147 --> 32:32.147
 zero.

32:37.088 --> 32:38.789
 TORY: Oh!

32:38.790 --> 32:40.590
 Ha ha!

32:40.591 --> 32:43.493
 That was awesome!

32:43.494 --> 32:45.862
 NARRATOR:
 With over 10 times the might

32:45.863 --> 32:48.863
 of any other Mythbusters boom...

32:50.535 --> 32:53.303
...it sure was a blast.

32:53.304 --> 32:56.304
 But did it germinate
 any gemstones?

32:58.776 --> 33:01.776
 The Mythbusters are getting
 all bacteriological,

33:01.913 --> 33:04.913
 as they probe a "Seinfeld"
 double-dipping dilemma.

33:06.684 --> 33:08.919
 But thanks to masses
 of microbes,

33:08.920 --> 33:10.754
 their first test was ruined.

33:10.755 --> 33:13.755
 So this time, the boys
 are taking precautions.

33:14.258 --> 33:15.759
 We need to do
 what we normally do,

33:15.760 --> 33:17.661
 which is start
 eliminating variables,

33:17.662 --> 33:19.429
 and then get back in there
 and do the test.

33:19.430 --> 33:22.332
 So, sterile salsa,
 sterile chips, clean space,

33:22.333 --> 33:24.468
 rubber gloves, surgical masks.

33:24.469 --> 33:26.670
 The only variable
 being our saliva?

33:26.671 --> 33:27.838
 Exactly.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.007
 Perfect.
 Let's do it.

33:30.008 --> 33:33.008
 NARRATOR: So Adam starts
 with the chip sterilization,

33:33.211 --> 33:36.211
 heading to NUTEK Corporation
 to have them irradiated.

33:38.316 --> 33:40.017
 Will these be safe to eat
 after that?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.585
 Oh, sure.
 They might taste a little funny.

33:41.586 --> 33:43.186
 But they'll be totally safe
 to eat.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.654
 Okay, great.

33:44.655 --> 33:47.655
 NARRATOR: Funny-tasting,
 and more importantly, sterile.

33:48.493 --> 33:51.493
 Friends and family of bacteria
 may want to look away now,

33:52.663 --> 33:55.663
 because 2.5 million rads
 of radiation

33:55.933 --> 33:57.934
 is about to be unleashed.

33:57.935 --> 34:00.370
 That is so much cooler
 than I thought it would be.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.706
 I mean, I can see this beam
 coming down,

34:02.707 --> 34:05.707
 like an anvil crushing bacteria
 in its wake,

34:05.943 --> 34:08.943
 electrons scattering
 little bacteriological lives

34:09.013 --> 34:10.147
 to the winds.

34:10.148 --> 34:11.614
 NARRATOR:
 Uncharacteristically,

34:11.616 --> 34:14.418
 Adam is enjoying this
 far too much,

34:14.418 --> 34:16.485
 and soon enough...

34:16.487 --> 34:19.487
 There you have it. One set
 of totally sterile chips.

34:20.291 --> 34:22.259
 NARRATOR:
 Meanwhile, back at the shop,

34:22.260 --> 34:25.260
 Jamie's also getting sterile
 for science.

34:25.596 --> 34:27.998
 He first builds
 a clean room for the test

34:27.998 --> 34:30.998
 and then conjures up
 some decontaminated dip.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.969
 Two parts agar,
 one part sterilized water,

34:35.572 --> 34:37.174
 and voilÃ .

34:37.175 --> 34:38.574
 JAMIE:
 Well, okay, then.

34:38.576 --> 34:41.511
 I think that kind of looks like

34:41.512 --> 34:43.780
 as close to salsa
 as we're gonna get.

34:43.781 --> 34:45.882
 NARRATOR: To make sure
 the test runs smoothly,

34:45.882 --> 34:48.882
 the boys have Dr. Russell Vance,
 an expert in pathogenesis.

34:50.154 --> 34:52.589
 He's the guy in the middle.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.157
 What's first?

34:54.158 --> 34:57.158
 NARRATOR: That would be
 the salsa-only control.

34:57.595 --> 35:00.230
 Using much more
 sophisticated equipment

35:00.231 --> 35:01.798
 than those earlier swabs,

35:01.799 --> 35:04.799
 Dr. Vance prepares
 the petri dishes.

35:04.836 --> 35:05.869
 What now?

35:05.870 --> 35:07.304
 Now is double dipping,

35:07.305 --> 35:10.305
 except this time with
 the fully irradiated chips.

35:10.675 --> 35:13.610
 Okay, here we go.

35:13.611 --> 35:16.611
 NARRATOR:
 Once the infamous double dip...

35:17.415 --> 35:20.415
...has been, uh,
 double dipped...

35:21.219 --> 35:23.920
...the salsa is sampled
 and plated up,

35:23.921 --> 35:26.590
 leaving just
 the full-mouth test.

35:26.591 --> 35:29.591
 All right.
 Now for the really gross one.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.796
 NARRATOR: And, once again,
 it's delightful... to watch.

35:37.935 --> 35:39.569
 ADAM: Ugh!

35:39.570 --> 35:42.570
 It's almost worse watching you
 do it than doing it myself.

35:42.907 --> 35:44.608
 NARRATOR:
 That's experiment over.

35:44.609 --> 35:47.244
 Dr. Vance plates
 the full-mouth tests,

35:47.245 --> 35:49.846
 and they join the double-dipped
 and control plates

35:49.847 --> 35:51.448
 in the incubator.

35:51.449 --> 35:53.717
 DR. VANCE: Okay,
 they're in the incubator.

35:53.718 --> 35:55.018
 JAMIE:
 Thanks, Dr. Vance.

35:55.019 --> 35:56.820
 Now we wait.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.588
 NARRATOR:
 But not for long.

35:58.589 --> 35:59.356
 [ Ding ]

35:59.357 --> 36:02.357
 So, for viewers playing at home,
 here's what to look for.

36:03.194 --> 36:05.729
 The stated myth
 is that double dipping

36:05.730 --> 36:08.730
 is just as bad as putting your
 whole mouth in the bowl of dip,

36:09.467 --> 36:12.235
 in terms
 of transmitting bacteria to it.

36:12.236 --> 36:13.370
 So if this is true,

36:13.371 --> 36:15.238
 we would expect to see
 the same amount of bacteria

36:15.239 --> 36:16.806
 on the double-dipping petri dish

36:16.807 --> 36:19.476
 as we would
 on the whole-mouth-in-the-bowl

36:19.477 --> 36:20.777
 petri dish.

36:20.778 --> 36:22.512
 Here we go.

36:22.513 --> 36:25.513
 This is my control.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.150
 It's clean.

36:27.151 --> 36:28.685
 ADAM:
 Here's your control.

36:28.686 --> 36:29.853
 JAMIE:
 It's clean.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.088
 Just what we expected to see.

36:32.089 --> 36:33.323
 That's a clean start,

36:33.324 --> 36:36.324
 meaning Jamie's salsa
 was bacteria-free.

36:37.061 --> 36:38.528
 So, from here on in,

36:38.529 --> 36:41.529
 any microbes can only be
 from their saliva.

36:42.333 --> 36:45.333
 Here is my double dipping.

36:45.503 --> 36:48.503
 JAMIE:
 Oh, maybe one.

36:48.773 --> 36:51.773
 NARRATOR:
 There's one bacterial colony.

36:52.176 --> 36:54.711
 And for Jamie...

36:54.712 --> 36:56.746
 Oh, maybe three or four or so.

36:56.747 --> 36:58.281
 NARRATOR:
 But how does that compare

36:58.282 --> 37:01.282
 with the whole-mouth results?

37:01.452 --> 37:02.419
 Lots.

37:02.420 --> 37:05.420
 Tons!
 Check out yours.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.024
 JAMIE:
 Also lots.

37:08.025 --> 37:10.093
 About the same.

37:10.094 --> 37:12.095
 Well, I guess that tells
 the whole story, doesn't it?

37:12.096 --> 37:15.096
 It tells the entire story
 that we set out to tell.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.733
 So, to all those germophobes out
 there, I say double dipping --

37:20.304 --> 37:22.205
 not such a big deal.

37:22.206 --> 37:24.007
 Plenty more bacteria in here

37:24.008 --> 37:26.176
 than you are imparting
 by double dipping.

37:26.177 --> 37:29.177
 And, besides, what the heck's
 your immune system for anyway?

37:30.481 --> 37:33.481
 NARRATOR: Indeed.

37:35.620 --> 37:38.221
 The Mythbusters' attempts
 at homemade diamonds

37:38.222 --> 37:39.556
 failed miserably.

37:39.557 --> 37:40.690
 KARI: Dead!

37:40.691 --> 37:43.360
 NARRATOR: So they hunkered
 in a bunker to test the tale

37:43.361 --> 37:46.361
 that you can use explosives
 to bring forth some bling.

37:48.799 --> 37:50.667
 TORY: Oh!

37:50.668 --> 37:53.668
 That was awesome!

37:59.143 --> 38:02.143
 NARRATOR: The theory is that the
 pressure and heat at ground zero

38:03.114 --> 38:06.114
 is so intense, it converts
 carbon to diamond in an instant.

38:08.586 --> 38:11.586
 So to delve deeper into that
 theory, it's back to the lab

38:12.356 --> 38:14.824
 so the team can prep
 a more manageable

38:14.825 --> 38:17.360
 diamond explosion of their own.

38:17.361 --> 38:20.063
 So, this is the device
 that we're gonna be using.

38:20.064 --> 38:21.431
 We're gonna have you guys pack

38:21.432 --> 38:23.667
 the special sauce
 into the device here.

38:23.668 --> 38:26.668
 NARRATOR: This metal tube sits
 at the center of the blast.

38:27.605 --> 38:30.605
 And in the center of that
 is a mixture of graphite,

38:30.875 --> 38:33.243
 cobalt, and other chemicals.

38:33.244 --> 38:36.244
 The cylinder is placed in the
 very center of a wooden barrel,

38:36.714 --> 38:39.714
 which is then filled to the brim
 with ANFO.

38:40.384 --> 38:42.919
 -TORY: Mmm, it smells good.
 -GRANT: Yeah.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.422
 TORY:
 It smells like diamonds!

38:45.423 --> 38:48.024
 Now, I know they say diamonds
 are a girl's best friend,

38:48.025 --> 38:49.326
 but let's face it.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.361
 If you're making diamonds
 with explosives,

38:51.362 --> 38:53.163
 I'm starting to warm up
 to them myself.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.999
 NARRATOR:
 It's a win-bling situation,

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
 so the team hunkers
 in the bunker once again.

38:59.437 --> 39:02.437
 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, zero.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.288
 NARRATOR: That blast may have
 been a wee bit smaller,

39:18.289 --> 39:21.289
 but the effect should still be
 the same -- diamonds,

39:21.425 --> 39:22.492
 apparently.

39:22.493 --> 39:24.194
 -TORY: Whoa!
 -GRANT: Dude.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.262
 That looks in much better shape

39:26.263 --> 39:27.697
 than I thought
 it was gonna look.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.432
 DR. ROMERO: That's what we
 wanted. Pressure and heat.

39:29.433 --> 39:31.134
 -Yeah.
 -Yeah.

39:31.135 --> 39:32.168
 NARRATOR:
 Back at the shop,

39:32.169 --> 39:35.169
 it's the moment of truth
 as the very myth gets dissected.

39:36.240 --> 39:38.074
 Tory's so confident,

39:38.075 --> 39:41.075
 he's taking precautions
 against bling blindness.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.079
 Everybody's happy.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.048
 Ready to see our diamonds?

39:45.049 --> 39:47.083
 Show me the money.

39:47.084 --> 39:50.084
 Perfect! That's great.
 Excellent. Good job.

39:50.254 --> 39:51.354
 Where's the diamond?

39:51.355 --> 39:52.522
 Well, we've got to take it

39:52.523 --> 39:54.591
 through a few chemical
 processes first.

39:54.592 --> 39:56.393
 NARRATOR:
 They might not look like much,

39:56.394 --> 39:58.294
 but after a quick chemical bath

39:58.295 --> 40:01.295
 to remove the excess cobalt
 and graphite,

40:01.332 --> 40:03.666
 uh, they still don't look
 like much.

40:03.667 --> 40:06.503
 But these are
 definitely diamonds.

40:06.504 --> 40:09.504
 Gemstones, no.
 Diamonds, yes.

40:10.141 --> 40:11.641
 So how much
 are these diamonds worth?

40:11.642 --> 40:13.676
 -About a quarter.
 -TORY: Quarter of a million?

40:13.677 --> 40:14.944
 No. 25 cents.

40:14.945 --> 40:17.380
 Oh, that was money well spent.

40:17.381 --> 40:20.381
 I'm going back to getting
 diamonds the old-fashioned way.

40:22.119 --> 40:25.119
 NARRATOR: The blast may have
 mimicked the pressure and heat

40:25.156 --> 40:26.389
 of the earth's core.

40:26.390 --> 40:29.390
 But even
 with all that explosive energy,

40:29.493 --> 40:32.493
 the end result is still
 only cheap and cheerful

40:33.130 --> 40:34.764
 industrial diamonds.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.966
 We made diamonds
 in a completely spectacular,

40:36.967 --> 40:39.202
 totally
 impossible-to-do-at-home way,

40:39.203 --> 40:41.104
 but still,
 all that heat and pressure --

40:41.105 --> 40:42.739
 We didn't get gemstones.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.174
 Yeah, we made little diamonds.

40:44.175 --> 40:45.642
 The kind that you use
 in industry.

40:45.643 --> 40:47.577
 The kinds that you put on
 a drill bit or a saw blade.

40:47.578 --> 40:48.578
 Stuff like that.

40:48.579 --> 40:50.647
 So the idea
 of homemade gemstones --

40:50.648 --> 40:52.849
 totally and completely busted.

40:52.850 --> 40:55.485
 And like virtually
 all get-rich-quick schemes,

40:55.486 --> 40:56.486
 this one's bogus.

40:56.487 --> 40:59.487
 Don't you guys want to see that
 5,000-pound explosion again?

40:59.623 --> 41:02.623
 -Absolutely.
 -Yeah!

41:03.828 --> 41:06.095
 NARRATOR: While the team
 may not have made their fortune

41:06.096 --> 41:09.096
 with diamond gems...

41:09.533 --> 41:12.533
...they did make
 Mythbusters history.
