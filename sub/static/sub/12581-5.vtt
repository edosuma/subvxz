PEGGY:
Hank!

00:32.843 --> 00:34.470
I found the coupons.

00:34.511 --> 00:36.342
Oh... they've expired.

00:36.380 --> 00:37.813
Dang it.

00:37.848 --> 00:40.078
Aw, heck, I'm really in
the mood for some ice cream.

00:40.117 --> 00:41.675
Let’s just pay
the full price.

00:41.719 --> 00:44.313
Uh, you guys
go on ahead without me.

00:44.355 --> 00:46.619
I'm sticking
to my New Year's resolution...

00:46.657 --> 00:48.249
ice cream once a day.

00:48.292 --> 00:49.259
Attaboy, Bobby.

00:49.293 --> 00:51.261
Nothing tastes sweeter
than self-discipline.

01:00.204 --> 01:04.265
That's right...
go get your ice cream.

It’s just that kid...

01:40.611 --> 01:42.579
he stuck his fingers
in the ice cream

01:42.613 --> 01:44.672

Bobby, what the hell are
you doing with my dog?

01:56.794 --> 01:58.762
I... it's, uh...
it's extreme training.

01:58.796 --> 01:59.820
Looked like dancing to me.

01:59.863 --> 02:01.091
It was dancing.

02:01.131 --> 02:03.099
It's called
"Musical Canine Freestyle."

02:03.133 --> 02:04.395
Liar.
No, no, no.

02:04.435 --> 02:06.232
Look, it's a real thing.

02:06.270 --> 02:08.238
They have contests,
and everything.

02:08.271 --> 02:09.933
It started
up in Canada.

02:09.973 --> 02:12.134
They're supposed
to be our allies.

02:12.176 --> 02:13.234
Dad, it's okay.

02:13.277 --> 02:15.802
The routine we worked out
is low-impact

02:15.846 --> 02:17.279
and Ladybird loves it.

02:17.314 --> 02:18.747
She's 13 years old.

02:18.782 --> 02:21.683
If I hadn't stopped
you when I did

02:21.718 --> 02:23.879
you could have
displaced her hip.

02:23.921 --> 02:27.186
But we were training for
a contest in McMaynerbury.

02:27.224 --> 02:30.421
No. No more dancing,
or any other Canadian tricks.

02:30.461 --> 02:31.519
She's got arthritis.

02:31.562 --> 02:32.620
Who's got arthritis?

02:32.663 --> 02:33.721
Yes, you do.

02:33.764 --> 02:36.289
Come on, girl,
time for your nap.

02:36.333 --> 02:39.962
I'll turn on the dryer
to help you sleep.

02:40.003 --> 02:41.095
(sighing)

02:41.138 --> 02:43.163
Just when I think
the boy is acting normal

02:43.207 --> 02:45.266
I catch him dancing
with Ladybird.

02:45.309 --> 02:48.005
Ugh! And he had her
wearing a bandanna.

02:48.045 --> 02:49.774
Dog b' man
best friend, man.

02:49.813 --> 02:51.781
Talkin' 'bout no
can't no dress 'em up

02:51.815 --> 02:53.783
like some of them dang ol'
little lady's poodle, man.

02:53.817 --> 02:55.785
Talkin' 'bout
d-d-dang ol' dog, man.

02:55.819 --> 02:56.786
No dignity, man.

02:56.820 --> 02:57.787
No dignity.

02:57.821 --> 02:58.810
Exactly,
Boomhauer.

02:58.856 --> 03:01.791
Pfff! Dancing with
dogs- ridiculous.

03:01.825 --> 03:04.487
Next thing you know
they'll have them smoking.

03:04.528 --> 03:07.395
Hey, that's not a bad idea...
doggie cigarettes.

03:07.431 --> 03:09.228
I thought of it first!

03:09.266 --> 03:10.665
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

03:10.701 --> 03:12.896
What kind of dance
were they doing, Hank?

03:12.936 --> 03:14.096
Uh, I don't know.

03:14.138 --> 03:15.435
The Twist. Why?

03:15.472 --> 03:19.203
Uh... Bobby
should be severely punished.

03:19.243 --> 03:20.471
What was he thinking?

03:20.511 --> 03:21.705
It's a jackass sport.

03:21.745 --> 03:23.007
(nervous chuckle):
Excuse me.

03:23.046 --> 03:26.243
I have to attend to
a personal matter of
pressing importance.

03:26.283 --> 03:29.184
Bill's so busy
these days.

03:29.219 --> 03:30.379
(sighing)

03:30.420 --> 03:33.287
I'm going to miss
dancing with that dog.

03:33.323 --> 03:36.121
You know, I dance
with the seniors

03:36.160 --> 03:38.151
down at the
nursing home.

03:38.195 --> 03:40.629
Maybe that would
cheer you up.

03:40.664 --> 03:45.533
It would be nice to have
a boy there for a change.

03:45.569 --> 03:47.161
Have you been listening?

03:47.204 --> 03:50.833
I want to dance with dogs,
no told people.

03:50.874 --> 03:51.841
Geez.

03:51.875 --> 03:52.842
Hey.

03:52.876 --> 03:55.709
MAN ON RADIO 1:
When you see him
in person

03:55.746 --> 03:57.771
he is really
a monster.

03:57.814 --> 04:02.183
MAN ON RADIO 2:
Five feet if
he's an inch.

04:02.219 --> 04:03.186
This new planer

04:03.220 --> 04:06.519
really does the trick,
huh, Ladybird?

04:06.557 --> 04:12.518
(changes to slow
western swing music)

04:17.000 --> 04:17.966
Watch it, Ladybird.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.060
Daddy's using the planer.

04:21.103 --> 04:23.072
What is it, Ladybird?

04:24.374 --> 04:27.901
You like that
music, huh, girl?

04:38.322 --> 04:43.123
Ladybird,
you're a beautiful dancer.

04:45.996 --> 04:47.623
I'm looking
to adopt a dog

04:47.664 --> 04:49.859
that could be
a good dancing partner.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.801
One that can really
cut a rug.

04:52.836 --> 04:55.100
I was thinking
maybe a longhair.

04:55.138 --> 04:56.969
I like long hair.

04:57.007 --> 04:59.407
That one there?

04:59.443 --> 05:01.411
Yeah, well,
he looks like he's strong

05:01.445 --> 05:03.413
and he's certainly got
a lot of energy.

05:03.447 --> 05:06.439
Are they a good breed
for dog dancing?

05:06.483 --> 05:09.475
Oh, yeah, they're,
uh, bred for dancing.

05:09.519 --> 05:12.955
Oh! I hope
you like rock 'n roll!

05:12.990 --> 05:16.426
So, you want to
dance with my dog.

05:16.460 --> 05:20.760
But what’s in it
for the big dog... me, Khan?

05:20.797 --> 05:21.764
Uh...

05:21.798 --> 05:23.766
How about
you pick up Doggie's poo

05:23.800 --> 05:24.767
from my yard?

05:24.801 --> 05:26.769
That way, child prodigy Connie
get to study more

05:26.803 --> 05:29.738
poo-picking hillbilly
get to dance with dog.

05:29.773 --> 05:32.469
Universe in harmony.

05:32.509 --> 05:35.774
He's a small dog.

05:35.812 --> 05:39.908
How bad could it be?

05:39.950 --> 05:40.917
Yeah.

05:40.951 --> 05:41.918
Deal.

05:41.952 --> 05:44.045
You start now!

05:44.087 --> 05:45.679
Oh, geez!

05:45.722 --> 05:49.818
What are you
feeding him?!

05:49.860 --> 05:55.628
Just going to, uh, get gas.

05:55.666 --> 06:02.230
♪ I go out walkin'
after midnight ♪

06:02.272 --> 06:08.233
♪ Out in the moonlight,
just like we used to do... ♪

06:11.782 --> 06:15.843
Hey, Peggy, you notice anything
different about Ladybird?

06:15.886 --> 06:17.877
Is the left side of
her face paralyzed?

06:17.921 --> 06:19.889
Nope. She's lost two pounds.

06:19.923 --> 06:21.891
Tapeworm!
That was my second guess.

06:21.925 --> 06:25.156
No. Since I've been,
uh, walking her more

06:25.195 --> 06:27.925
she's been getting
in great shape. Listen.

06:27.964 --> 06:28.931
No creaking joints

06:28.965 --> 06:30.057
and I've stopped
giving her

06:30.100 --> 06:32.933
her anti-inflammatory
medication.

06:32.969 --> 06:33.936
(barks)

06:33.970 --> 06:35.938
Even her bark
sounds more youthful.

06:35.972 --> 06:37.803
It's like she's a puppy again.

06:37.841 --> 06:40.605
You know, I'm going to keep...
walking her.

06:40.644 --> 06:43.112
I don't care
what anybody thinks.

06:43.146 --> 06:45.114
I love you, Peggy.

06:48.618 --> 06:49.846
Hey, Ladybird

06:49.886 --> 06:51.854
remember when you won
this ribbon

06:51.888 --> 06:53.253
for cutest puppy
at the mall?

06:53.290 --> 06:54.518
Huh, do you?

06:54.558 --> 06:55.525
Labor Day?

06:55.559 --> 06:56.617
Remember that, huh,
do you?

06:56.660 --> 06:58.025
Fall of '89...
huh?

06:58.061 --> 06:59.528
Do you remember?

06:59.563 --> 07:00.825
(barks)

07:00.864 --> 07:02.855
Yeah, me, too.

07:02.899 --> 07:04.867
Let's win you another ribbon,
girl.

07:08.772 --> 07:11.707
She's named after former
First Lady Lady Bird Johnson.

07:11.742 --> 07:13.869
So, there is no
limit to the number

07:13.910 --> 07:16.902
of sequins an entrant
can have on his costume?

07:16.947 --> 07:18.539
Can I get that in writing?

07:18.582 --> 07:21.073
Mr. Hill,
you forgot your pen.

07:21.118 --> 07:23.245
Dad?

07:23.286 --> 07:25.117
What are you doing here?

07:25.155 --> 07:27.123
Okay, I know
what this looks like

07:27.157 --> 07:28.818
and it is what it is.

07:28.859 --> 07:30.053
You lied.

07:30.093 --> 07:33.790
You made me think dog dancing
was for weirdos.

07:33.830 --> 07:35.991
Wait a minute,
that's Khan's dog.

07:36.032 --> 07:38.466
You're dancing
with the neighbor's dog

07:38.502 --> 07:40.129
against me and Ladybird?

07:40.170 --> 07:43.264
Well, what was I supposed to do,
not dance with a dog?!

07:43.306 --> 07:47.208
And anyway, you said Ladybird
was too old to dance.

07:47.244 --> 07:49.212
If you pumped her
full of pain pills

07:49.246 --> 07:51.214
I'm make sure you're
both disqualified.

07:51.248 --> 07:52.215
Well, what
do you care?

07:52.249 --> 07:53.216
Looks like
you'll dance

07:53.250 --> 07:55.218
with any dog
that will have you.

07:55.252 --> 07:57.049
Oh, he's not
just any dog.

07:57.087 --> 07:59.317
This little fella may
poo like a buffalo

07:59.356 --> 08:01.950
but he dances like
Britney Spears.

08:01.992 --> 08:03.152
Oh, yeah? Well, I think

08:03.193 --> 08:05.161
this pup's going
to surprise you

08:05.195 --> 08:06.662
with a few moves
of her own.

08:06.696 --> 08:10.257
I believe it's up to the judges
to decide

08:10.300 --> 08:12.791
who's got the moves
and who doesn't.

08:12.836 --> 08:14.804
I'll see you
out on the dance floor.

08:17.841 --> 08:20.935
Fwah!
That’s just a little taste.

08:20.977 --> 08:24.879
Dad. Ladybird.

08:31.321 --> 08:32.288
BOBBY:
Just let us in.

08:32.322 --> 08:34.153
We'll go straight
to my room.

08:34.191 --> 08:35.681
We need to practice.

08:35.725 --> 08:37.693
You're dancing
with the neighbor's dog.

08:37.727 --> 08:38.852
Go dance at the neighbor's.

08:38.895 --> 08:40.885
Come on!

08:40.931 --> 08:42.455
Leave,
or I'll call the pound.

08:42.499 --> 08:45.332
You're scared, old man.

08:45.368 --> 08:48.929
You're scared of my moves!

08:48.972 --> 08:50.439
That's crazy.

08:50.474 --> 08:51.441
Peggy?

08:51.475 --> 08:53.807
Hank, this is
all very simple.

08:53.844 --> 08:56.779
You both want to
dance with dogs.

08:56.813 --> 08:59.907
Right. You each have a
dog you can dance with.

08:59.950 --> 09:02.248
You take your dog
to the garage.

09:02.285 --> 09:03.752
You dance
with her there.

09:03.787 --> 09:07.154
Bobby gets to dance with
his dog in his bedroom.

09:07.190 --> 09:09.750
Everybody gets to
dance with a dog.

09:09.793 --> 09:10.919
Everybody wins.

09:10.961 --> 09:13.486
(country line dance-
title music playing)

09:13.530 --> 09:18.968
You ready to dance, Rex?

09:19.002 --> 09:24.634

10:31.141 --> 10:33.632
Wow. Ladybird,
I really think

10:33.677 --> 10:35.508
we're going to
win this thing.

10:35.545 --> 10:36.512

10:36.546 --> 10:38.946
Hank, I know you
don't like dog dancing

10:38.982 --> 10:40.779
but I need your advice.

10:40.817 --> 10:42.648
I bought a dog
to dance with.

10:42.686 --> 10:43.653
It won’t dance with me!

10:43.687 --> 10:45.746
It's all my fault.

10:45.789 --> 10:47.757
I'm doing something
to push it away

10:47.791 --> 10:49.452
just like I pushed
away Lenore.

10:49.492 --> 10:51.460
(groaning):
Bill, this isn't a good time.

10:51.494 --> 10:53.462
I-I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

10:53.496 --> 10:54.463
(chuckling):
Aw!

10:54.497 --> 10:57.864
Doesn't Ladybird
look cute in that hat?

10:57.901 --> 11:00.699
(gasping)

11:00.737 --> 11:01.704
Hank.

11:01.738 --> 11:04.036
You're dog dancing!

11:04.074 --> 11:08.238
Look, you cannot tell Dale
or Boomhauer about this, okay?

11:08.278 --> 11:09.404
They wouldn't understand.

11:09.446 --> 11:11.414
No, of course
they wouldn't;
they're idiots.

11:11.448 --> 11:16.010
Oh, isn't dog dancing
wonderful, Hank?

11:16.052 --> 11:17.019
Yes.

11:17.053 --> 11:21.012
What am I doing to make
the dog hate me, Hank?

11:21.057 --> 11:23.525
Why? Why am I
so repulsive?

11:23.560 --> 11:25.619
You're not repulsive,
Bill. Maybe...

11:25.662 --> 11:26.629
Yes?

11:26.663 --> 11:28.631
Maybe it's the song
you picked out.

11:28.665 --> 11:29.563
The song, yes,
the song!

11:29.599 --> 11:30.566
What about the song?

11:30.600 --> 11:32.568
Let your dog
help choose the song.

11:32.602 --> 11:34.570
Just don't let him
pick something

11:34.604 --> 11:36.572
like "Doggie in the Window"
or"Hound Dog."

11:36.606 --> 11:37.573
It's too obvious.

11:37.607 --> 11:39.575
Wait, why am I
telling you this?

11:39.609 --> 11:41.577
You're not entering
the competition, are you?

11:41.611 --> 11:45.547
Well, yeah,
I thought...

11:45.582 --> 11:48.050
Get out.

11:48.084 --> 11:49.278
Mm-mm.

11:49.319 --> 11:53.050
This is good.

11:53.089 --> 11:56.786
Nice and salty.

11:56.826 --> 11:59.590
I said the funniest thing today.

11:59.629 --> 12:01.062
Well, I almost did...

12:01.097 --> 12:03.065
Are you going to finish
that gristle?

12:03.099 --> 12:05.067
Yes, as a matter
of fact, I am.

12:05.101 --> 12:06.693
But you never eat
your gristle.

12:06.736 --> 12:08.169
You always give it
to Ladybird.

12:08.204 --> 12:10.968
(gobbling)

12:11.007 --> 12:11.974
Spit it out.

12:12.008 --> 12:13.134
You don't even like gristle.

12:13.176 --> 12:16.543
But I do like the taste
of you not getting it.

12:16.579 --> 12:19.070
Hank, Bobby, stop it.

12:19.115 --> 12:22.380
No ribbon is more important
than your family.

12:22.419 --> 12:25.217
For God's sake,
you are fighting over fat.

12:25.255 --> 12:27.223
Yeah, you're right,
you're right.

12:27.257 --> 12:29.282
Uh, let me make it up
to both of you.

12:29.325 --> 12:32.692
Peggy, let's go out dancing
like we usually do

12:32.729 --> 12:36.495
and let Bobby and Doggie
have the house to practice.

12:36.533 --> 12:37.500
Alone.

12:37.534 --> 12:40.094
But you have to lock
Ladybird in the garage.

12:40.136 --> 12:41.103
Of course.

12:44.140 --> 12:47.871
Oh, it is certainly nice
to get out of the house.

12:47.911 --> 12:50.675
It's been so tense with all
the arguing and barking.

12:50.714 --> 12:53.979
I'm glad you're having fun,
'cause you deserve it.

12:54.017 --> 12:55.075
Oh! Hank...

12:55.118 --> 12:57.177
You are dip-crazy
tonight.

12:57.220 --> 12:59.313
Yup, yup.

12:59.355 --> 13:01.289
So, uh, since
you brought it up

13:01.324 --> 13:04.293
do you know if Bobby does
any dips in his routine?

13:04.327 --> 13:06.295
Or any other moves
you've noticed.

13:06.329 --> 13:08.524
Are you pumping me
for information?

13:08.565 --> 13:10.556
How much backwards
walking are they doing?

13:10.600 --> 13:12.534
A little, average or a lot?

13:12.569 --> 13:15.060
Hank, I am trying really hard
to remain neutral here.

13:15.105 --> 13:17.198
I thought you wanted
to dance with me.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.208
I do, I do, you're right.

13:19.242 --> 13:21.176
It’s just you and me, Ladybird.

13:21.211 --> 13:22.178
What?!

13:22.212 --> 13:23.543
You just blew it, mister.

13:23.580 --> 13:25.013
Fine. You know what?

13:25.048 --> 13:26.276
I hope Bobby wins.

13:26.316 --> 13:27.283
What?

13:27.317 --> 13:28.841
Oh, sure, go home to Bobby

13:28.885 --> 13:30.079
and the neighbor's dog.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.087
While you're at it

13:31.121 --> 13:33.214
why don't you just move in
with Kahn and Mihn?

13:33.256 --> 13:36.123
You can eat rice all day
and never celebrate Christmas.

13:36.159 --> 13:37.126
Good luck, Hank.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.993
It's got nothing
to do with luck, Peggy.

13:40.029 --> 13:41.496
We're going to win this thing.

13:41.531 --> 13:44.227
You're making a big mistake.

13:44.267 --> 13:46.235
Ladybird hates you.

13:59.582 --> 14:02.107
What do they see
in that yappy little rat?

14:02.152 --> 14:04.484
We can win this thing
without them. Right, Ladybird?

14:04.521 --> 14:06.819
