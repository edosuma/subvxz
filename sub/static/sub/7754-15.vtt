Splat!

15:17.584 --> 15:21.419
>> Darwin: You got it on my
shoes.
>> Uh, do you want to share

15:21.421 --> 15:24.088
mine?
>> Gumball: [ Gasps ]
Very good.

15:24.090 --> 15:31.329
>> Ice cream, Darwin?
>> Darwin: Aw, thanks!
>> But, gumball,<i> you</i> don't have

15:31.331 --> 15:35.800
an ice cream.
Want to share mine?
>> Gumball: Sure.

15:38.237 --> 15:40.238
Oh...

15:45.244 --> 15:48.846
Dude, this is so gross!
>> Darwin: Why don't you pretend
you have your own ice cream?

15:48.848 --> 15:53.885
>> Gumball: Ugh!
Why didn't<i> i</i> think of that?
Friends also high-five, like

15:53.887 --> 15:56.988
this.
>> Both: High-five!
>> Gumball: Okay, now --

15:56.990 --> 15:59.958
[ whap! ]
No, i meant slap my --
[ Whap! ]

15:59.960 --> 16:04.495
Let's move on to the next
lesson.
How about we all play a game,

16:04.497 --> 16:08.232
like friends do?
Here's one we made up.
It's called...

16:08.234 --> 16:12.770
>> Both: Dodge or dare!
>> Gumball: Roll the dice.
Take a card.

16:12.772 --> 16:17.675
>> Both: What'd you get?
>> "Put a gooey hair ball in
miss simian's lunch."

16:17.677 --> 16:20.511
>> Gumball: [ Gasps ]
L-let me take that.
Pick another.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.314
>> "When miss simian's back is
turned --"
>> gumball: [ Chuckles ]

16:23.316 --> 16:26.284
A-actually, let me pick one for
you.
Uh, "cover simian in slug juice,

16:26.286 --> 16:29.320
drop water balloons on simian,
miss simian, miss simian,
miss simian --"

16:29.322 --> 16:32.390
heh heh. Forget the cards.
Here's a dare.
Make the most annoying noise

16:32.392 --> 16:38.763
possible.
>> Eeeh...
>> Gumball: O...Kay.

16:38.765 --> 16:43.201
That was...Good, but we know
that you can do better.
>> Darwin: Like when you're mad

16:43.203 --> 16:45.236
at us.
>> Oh, you mean this little
thing?

16:45.238 --> 16:52.243
Gu-u-u-u-mba-a-a-a-ll!!
[ High-pitched ringing ]
>> Both: That...Was...

16:52.245 --> 16:55.747
Awesome!
>> Gumball: High-five!
[ Whap! Whap! ]

16:55.749 --> 17:02.320
That still needs a little work.
>> Mom: I've got my eye on you,
simian.

17:02.322 --> 17:07.325
>> Dad: [ Laughing ]
Do it again!
Do it again!

17:07.327 --> 17:09.293
[ Laughter ]

17:13.365 --> 17:17.869
>> I'm so pleased to finally
have such great friends!
>> All: Ahhh!

17:17.871 --> 17:22.607
We love you, miss simian.
>> Mom: Sorry, kids.
Miss simian, c-can i have a word

17:22.609 --> 17:27.979
with you in private, please?
>> Yes, Nicole, how can i help
you?

17:27.981 --> 17:32.250
>> Mom: Listen, simian, you
might have the rest of them
fooled, but i don't trust you

17:32.252 --> 17:35.887
for a second.
I remember you from school.
I remember the horrible name you

17:35.889 --> 17:40.358
used to call me every day.
Do you remember that?
>> Yes, i do.

17:40.360 --> 17:44.429
And I'm sorry.
>> Mom: What?
>> I was that horrid person for

17:44.431 --> 17:49.901
so long, and look where it got
me.
No friends, no family -- just

17:49.903 --> 17:56.941
bitterness and wrinkles.
But even an old ape can change.
Will you give me that chance?

17:56.943 --> 18:01.712
>> Mom: Oh, i don't know.
It's all happening so fast.
>> Ple-e-e-e-e-ase?

18:01.714 --> 18:06.784
>> Mom: [ Shudders ]
Okay, I'll -- I'll give it
another shot.

18:06.786 --> 18:11.355
>> Gumball: What do we do now,
best friends?
>> Uh, let's see.

18:11.357 --> 18:15.059
I know!
Best friends write letters to
each other about how great they

18:15.061 --> 18:17.895
are.
>> Gumball: Wow!
What a...Friendly idea.

18:17.897 --> 18:22.100
What shall we write?
>> Um...Ooh...
How about "we, the

18:22.102 --> 18:26.137
aforementioned, unanimously
agree that miss simian is worthy
of this year's 'favorite

18:26.139 --> 18:28.873
teacher' award."
>> Gumball: "Favorite teacher
award."

18:28.875 --> 18:33.244
Okay! Done it!
>> [ Laughs maniacally ]
It's mine!

18:33.246 --> 18:38.382
[ Hip-hop music plays ]
Ah-a! Ha-mmm! Ah-mmm! Ah-a!
Ah-a! Uh-hmm! Uh-mmm!

18:38.384 --> 18:42.120
>> Darwin: Look how happy she
is.
>> Gumball: That's the power of

18:42.122 --> 18:46.290
friendship.
Wow!
You baked that cake for

18:46.292 --> 18:49.627
miss simian?
>> Mom: Yeah.
I think she deserves a second

18:49.629 --> 18:53.131
chance.
Is miss simian around?
>> Nah, dude.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.734
She just drove off.
[ Chuckles ]
You should have seen her, all

18:56.736 --> 19:02.073
dancing and laughing, saying she
finally got some losers to write
her a "favorite teacher"

19:02.075 --> 19:06.844
nomination.
[ All gasp ]
[ Shatter! ]

19:06.846 --> 19:13.918
>> Mom: What was the word she
used?
>> [ Slowly ] "Losers."

19:16.255 --> 19:20.458
>> Nicole: Unh!
>> Heh! Nice first steps, loser!
>> Nicole: Unh!

19:20.460 --> 19:25.530
>> [ Laughs ]
Nice cycling, loser!
Nice "poem," loser!

19:25.532 --> 19:32.170
Nice hair, loser.
Nice husband, loser!
[ Laughs maniacally ]

19:32.172 --> 19:36.207
>> Mom: Everyone, get back in
the car.
>> Dad: [ Munch! Munch! ]

19:36.209 --> 19:41.479
Now?
>> [ Laughing ]
Soon, the trophy will be mine.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.147
[ Bang! ]
Aaaah!
>> Mom: We'll see about that,

19:43.149 --> 19:46.651
you two-faced baboon!
>> There's nothing you can do
about it, loser!

19:46.653 --> 19:50.221
>> Gumball: Mom!
What are you doing?!
>> Mom: Something i should have

19:50.223 --> 19:53.457
done a long time ago.
[ Tires squeal ]
[ Engine revs ]

19:53.459 --> 19:58.763
[ Tires screech ]
Kids, throw stuff at her!
>> Gumball: But isn't that

19:58.765 --> 20:02.066
dangerous?
>> Mom: Not as dangerous as
disobeying your mother!

20:02.068 --> 20:09.974
>> Gumball: Sorry! Eh!
>> Ah! Oh! Aaah!
>> Anais: Open your mouth.

20:09.976 --> 20:13.744
>> Aah!
Ohh!
>> Gumball: I hope you like

20:13.746 --> 20:19.016
pepperoni!
>> Aaaaaah!
Aaaah!

20:19.018 --> 20:22.086
[ Fluttering ]
Huh?
Oh!

20:22.088 --> 20:29.060
That was close.
[ Gasps ]
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!

20:29.062 --> 20:35.199
>> Gumball: Cool!
>> Not coo-o-o-o-l!
>> Darwin: I thought you were

20:35.201 --> 20:38.903
our friend, miss simian.
>> Ha!
Who needs friends when you have

20:38.905 --> 20:41.272
this letter?
Aah!
[ Fluttering ]

20:41.274 --> 20:43.841
Huh?
>> Mom: There it is, Richard!
Get it!

20:43.843 --> 20:47.612
>> Dad: Do what?!
>> Mom: I'll get closer, and you
lean in and grab it.

20:47.614 --> 20:54.885
>> Dad: Seriously?
[ Squeaking ]
Little bit closer, honey!

20:54.887 --> 20:58.956
Ooh! Almost...There!
Aah!
>> Both: Dad!

20:58.958 --> 21:02.994
>> Dad: Oooh-whoo! Whoo-oooh!
>> Mom: Hold on!
>> Dad: Waaah-ha!

21:02.996 --> 21:05.496
Hi.
>> Bye!
>> Dad: Ow!

21:05.498 --> 21:12.603
[ Smack! Smack! Smack! ]
[ Horn blaring ]
>> All: Aaaaaaaah!

21:12.605 --> 21:16.974
>> Dad: Got it! Ha ha!
Aaaaaah!

21:20.445 --> 21:27.585
Whoooooa!
>> Mom: Never...Trick...My...
Family...Again!

21:27.587 --> 21:32.323
>> Anais: Mom, watch out!
[ Tires screech ]
>> [ Laughs ]

21:32.325 --> 21:37.094
Aaah!
[ Tires screeching ]
[ Crash! ]

21:37.096 --> 21:41.732
[ Clatter! ]
>> Mom: [ Panting ]
And that, kids, is why you wear

21:41.734 --> 21:47.905
seatbelts.
>> Gumball: Where's miss simian?
>> Uh...Huh...Ah...

21:47.907 --> 21:53.377
Ah-hey!
>> Gumball: Miss simian, no!
You could still be friends with

21:53.379 --> 21:55.346
us if you like.

22:01.687 --> 22:07.558
>> Nah!
[ Creak! ]
Aaaaaaaaaah!

22:07.560 --> 22:12.830
[ Crash! Boom! ]
>> Gumball: Ohhh.
>> Dad: What did i miss?

22:12.832 --> 22:16.801
>> All: Dad!
>> Mom: Oh, just simian taking a
little tumble.

22:16.803 --> 22:21.138
>> Dad: Maybe that'll teach
her for "monkeying around."
[ Laughter ]

22:21.140 --> 22:25.176
>> Mom: We shouldn't laugh.
She may be seriously hurt.
>> Dad: Well, you shouldn't have

22:25.178 --> 22:29.680
"gibbon" her a second chance.
[ Laughter ]
>> Mom: No, really.

22:29.682 --> 22:34.218
That's enough.
>> Dad: Well, she shouldn't have
"orangu-tangled" with us.

22:34.220 --> 22:37.188
[ Laughter ]
>> Mom: I said that's enough.

22:45.430 --> 22:45.462
>> That was so worth it.
