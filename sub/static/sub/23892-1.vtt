WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:03.504
[glass breaks]

00:22.756 --> 00:25.859
(propellers humming)

00:49.317 --> 00:52.120
(traffic rushing)

00:59.160 --> 01:01.762
(bell chiming)

01:13.241 --> 01:16.043
- No man has seen
God at any time.

01:17.044 --> 01:17.845
John 1:18.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.415
How do you define God?

01:21.449 --> 01:25.052
If you look at Christianity,
Judaism, Islam.

01:26.220 --> 01:29.823
Each group, we all
define God differently.

01:31.024 --> 01:34.495
And our definitions are
based on our culture,

01:35.696 --> 01:40.234
our geography, our experiences.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.636
- [Man] Amen, Brother Eli.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.076
- There's a great comfort
in defining things.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.311
Labeling them.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.614
It gives us a sense of control.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.115
But, if we define something,

01:55.149 --> 01:58.719
aren't we saying that
we understand it?

01:58.752 --> 02:02.590
Aren't we limiting it
with our own perspective?

02:09.530 --> 02:10.864
- I love Jesus.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.208
- Thank you, Brother Trevor.

02:21.975 --> 02:22.776
All right.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.582
As you all know, we
have a little potluck

02:28.616 --> 02:31.719
after the service
down in the, um...

02:31.752 --> 02:32.853
- Fellowship Hall.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.288
- Thank you, Miss Martha.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.123
The Fellowship Hall.

02:38.492 --> 02:42.696
You should all try some of my
wife's Tater Tot casserole.

02:43.797 --> 02:44.598
All right.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.069
Thanks so much for coming.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.672
See you all next Sunday.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.308
(choir singing)

03:08.121 --> 03:11.124
(people chattering)

03:27.241 --> 03:28.242
Oh, Trevor.
How are you doing?

03:28.276 --> 03:29.042
- I've got great news
for you, Preacher.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.378
- Oh, yeah?

03:30.411 --> 03:32.446
- I got the Southern
Baptist Board of Churches

03:32.480 --> 03:35.182
coming down here in two weeks.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.318
- Why would they be
interested in coming down?

03:37.351 --> 03:40.153
- Well, I just happened to
know their head talent scout,

03:40.187 --> 03:42.256
Brother Charles
Bucky. (chuckles)

03:42.290 --> 03:45.426
He and I actually went to
huntin' camp together as kids.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.127
I'm the one who actually
drug him to the nurse

03:47.160 --> 03:49.196
after I shot out his eye.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.832
- Well, my father never
joined the board, so I...

03:51.865 --> 03:54.067
- Your father drew 400.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.369
Manuel Baptist is the church.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.737
- Emmanuel Baptist just
gives out door prizes.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.672
- Well, maybe we should
give something out, too.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.008
- Besides the Word?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.476
- I'm gonna go
welcome the visitor.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.243
- All right.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.279
- Good talking to you.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.585
Hello, brother.

04:11.619 --> 04:15.188
I haven't seen you
in church before.

04:15.222 --> 04:18.225
I'm glad you made
it to the potluck.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.227
Do you want to come over

04:20.260 --> 04:23.196
and meet the rest
of the congregation?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.065
Okay.

04:27.735 --> 04:28.669
You want some time by yourself.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.304
I can respect that.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.271
I just wanted to come over
here and introduce myself.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.573
I'm Brother Eli.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.208
I'm the pastor here
at First Baptist.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.111
Okay.

04:40.247 --> 04:42.716
Well, enjoy your food.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.453
- [Man] I like your hands.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.720
- Excuse me?

04:46.754 --> 04:47.855
- Your hands.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.290
They're pretty.

04:51.425 --> 04:54.795
Like you ain't never
done anything with 'em.

04:54.828 --> 04:59.032
- (laughs) Well, I've
done things with my hands.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.134
- [Man] Like what?

05:01.168 --> 05:02.336
- Well, I do my studies.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.938
I wrote my sermon with my hands.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.009
- Church got any place
for folks to stay?

05:10.444 --> 05:14.748
- Unfortunately, we can't have
people staying in the church

05:14.782 --> 05:16.283
because of insurance reasons.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.986
- You got any place I can stay?

05:25.759 --> 05:26.527
- June.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.628
Oh, um.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.062
This is my wife.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.499
What was your name?

05:33.100 --> 05:33.867
- Daniel.

05:33.901 --> 05:34.668
- Daniel, Daniel.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.269
- Hello.

05:36.303 --> 05:40.374
- Daniel, we have a nice
service on Sunday nights

05:40.408 --> 05:42.910
at six o'clock with
a nice worship band.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.945
You're more than welcome...

05:44.978 --> 05:47.314
It's good to meet you.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.148
All right.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.317
- He might come.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.152
- Yeah, you never know.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.353
- [Preacher] If
you've been born again

05:53.387 --> 05:55.055
and you have the love
of God in your heart,

05:55.088 --> 05:58.492
then you are called
to spread his message.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.060
When I go out soul winning,

06:00.093 --> 06:03.497
I go in assuming that
they are gonna get saved.

06:03.531 --> 06:04.765
Now, you may say, Brother Aaron,

06:04.798 --> 06:06.166
it doesn't always
happen that way.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.570
Like seeds falling
on hard soil some...

06:09.603 --> 06:10.704
And sure, there
are gonna be days

06:10.738 --> 06:12.272
when you're giving it your all.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.475
You're knocking on doors,
you're passing out pamphlets,

06:14.508 --> 06:16.376
you're stopping
people at Walmart.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.345
- Something on your mind?

06:20.013 --> 06:21.314
- No.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.383
- [Aaron On Radio] And
still folks don't get saved.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.718
But, you know what?

06:24.752 --> 06:27.755
We need to expect
that the Word of God

06:27.788 --> 06:29.389
is gonna change people.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.325
We preach with conviction
expecting something to happen.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.762
(gun fires)

06:36.430 --> 06:40.133
- [Eli] Praise the
Lord, that's a biggin.

06:40.167 --> 06:40.968
- Yeah.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.372
Follow me.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.744
Did you freeze up?

06:51.945 --> 06:53.947
Most people do on
the first time out.

06:53.981 --> 06:58.185
- [Eli] No, I had no intention
on shooting anything.

06:59.286 --> 07:02.089
(leaves rustling)

07:05.225 --> 07:07.761
- [Man] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.599
- [Trevor] I almost
shot your son.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.766
- That's all right.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.134
I got a spare at home.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.202
- God bless you, brother.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.369
- [Man] Hey, He does.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.871
Every single day.

07:17.905 --> 07:18.706
- Come on.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.278
Oh, yeah.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.482
(grunting)

07:29.650 --> 07:33.386
Best part of huntin'
is the cleanin'.

07:33.420 --> 07:37.424
Most people talk about the
trackin' and the shootin'.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.427
Hangin' with their buddies.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.261
Not me.

07:42.530 --> 07:43.997
No.

07:44.031 --> 07:47.635
For me, huntin' is
something you do with God.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.571
I like the blood.

07:50.604 --> 07:54.474
Not the sight of it as
much as the feel of it.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.009
It feels like life.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.912
Like hot liquid life.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.249
It's exhilarating.

08:02.282 --> 08:05.418
You know, sometimes I get
all dressed up for work

08:05.452 --> 08:07.988
in my suit, and my tie,
my hair all gelled.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.224
And I'll spot some
blood on my forearm,

08:11.258 --> 08:13.861
or under my nails,
or on my chin.

08:13.894 --> 08:18.098
Just between you and me,
I don't clean it off.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.001
Nope, I keep it with me
throughout the workday.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.537
I figure if an employee sees it

08:24.972 --> 08:28.542
maybe it'll make 'em
work a little bit harder.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.678
That blood is life.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.680
People respect, and
even fear a man,

08:32.713 --> 08:34.848
who can grab ahold of life.

08:34.882 --> 08:35.683
Take it.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.151
Take it.

08:51.999 --> 08:55.569
You know, offerings this
week was the lowest it's been

08:55.603 --> 08:59.339
since the first year
this church has existed.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.142
- I'm aware.

09:02.175 --> 09:05.512
- [Trevor] The
congregation's grumbling.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.148
- What do you mean
they're grumbling?

09:08.181 --> 09:11.585
- Some folks, not me, of course,

09:11.619 --> 09:14.287
but some folks are
talking about bringing in

09:14.321 --> 09:17.390
another pastor if
things don't improve.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.325
- That's my father's church.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.492
They can't take it away from me.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.094
- If they voted you out,

09:21.128 --> 09:24.932
there ain't a whole lot
you could do about it.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.937
Look, I am on your side.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.274
I'm the one who got the Southern
Baptist Board of Churches

09:34.307 --> 09:36.109
to come down here.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.477
Come on.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.212
That's exciting, man.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.450
- What do we do?

09:45.552 --> 09:48.656
- (laughs) Okay, okay.

09:50.223 --> 09:53.560
First, I need you to
bring your sermons

09:54.594 --> 09:57.430
down to the congregation
a little more, you know?

09:57.464 --> 09:58.799
People around here
like to feel like

09:58.832 --> 10:00.533
something's happening
in their souls

10:00.567 --> 10:02.803
and sometimes you're just
trying to make a little too much

10:02.836 --> 10:04.504
happen in their brains.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.607
So, let's bring back
some questions, you know?

10:07.641 --> 10:09.609
A call and response.

10:09.643 --> 10:10.644
Who loves Jesus?

10:10.678 --> 10:11.444
Well, I love Jesus.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.813
I love Jesus, too.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.514
I don't know, give 'em
something else to do

10:14.547 --> 10:16.549
besides just sitting there
listening to to you ramble.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.919
- You think I ramble?

10:18.952 --> 10:20.954
I outline my
sermons three times.

10:20.988 --> 10:21.989
- Forget I said that.

10:22.022 --> 10:22.823
I'm sorry.

10:24.692 --> 10:28.628
I told the board that the
week they is coming down,

10:28.662 --> 10:31.832
that that was the week
of our annual revival.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.433
- Our annual revival?

10:33.466 --> 10:36.737
- Yeah, we gotta get the
town behind us, you know?

10:36.770 --> 10:38.772
Singin', dancin', rededicatin'.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.073
That sort of thing.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.408
Get as many people out
as we possibly can.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.844
Put up signs, grill
up hot dogs, potlucks,

10:43.877 --> 10:45.178
whatever we need.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.781
Just make a good
first impression.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.885
I've no doubt that you
can be a good preacher.

10:51.919 --> 10:52.853
It takes time.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.487
Folks know that.

10:54.521 --> 10:57.324
All I'm saying is
now is the time.

10:59.526 --> 11:00.894
- [Aaron On Radio] Some folks,
they're gonna get to Heaven

11:00.928 --> 11:02.963
and get many crowns,
and many rewards.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.397
And other folks
are gonna get saved

11:04.431 --> 11:07.467
by the hairs of their chin.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.436
If God gave us what
we all deserve,

11:09.469 --> 11:11.438
we would all deserve damnation,

11:11.471 --> 11:14.708
but his grace, and his mercy,

11:14.742 --> 11:17.677
allows us believers to
enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

11:17.711 --> 11:20.380
And I'll tell you
this right now.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.583
I would rather be the
biggest loser in Heaven.

11:23.616 --> 11:24.752
Think about this now.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.653
I'd rather be cleaning
the toilets in Heaven

11:26.686 --> 11:30.323
than the guy in
Hell who God thinks,

11:30.357 --> 11:32.525
this fella didn't
know any better,

11:32.559 --> 11:35.763
I'm gonna give him
the least punishment.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.834
- Miss Martha says everyone
at the potluck thought

11:40.868 --> 11:42.836
this was the best
casserole there.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.838
She put a picture of it up.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.840
I swear, that woman.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.075
- It was good.

11:49.943 --> 11:50.710
- I'm sorry, babe.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.012
Mine was so much better.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.714
You know mine was better.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.149
- Yours was top.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.451
- [June] Yeah, mine was top.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.719
- I know.

11:59.753 --> 12:00.653
I had both.

12:01.955 --> 12:02.856
- It is different.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.492
Well, I'm not gonna like it, so.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.097
(tense violin music)

12:14.467 --> 12:17.070
(machine beeps)

13:06.386 --> 13:08.188
- [Eli] Daniel, right?

13:09.389 --> 13:10.523
- I'm hungry.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.229
- [Eli] Want to come in?

13:25.939 --> 13:26.739
- [Woman] Preacher.

13:26.773 --> 13:27.841
- Good morning.

13:27.875 --> 13:28.909
- We have got to pay this bill

13:28.942 --> 13:31.611
or they're gonna
shut off the power.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.013
- God will provide, Miss Martha.

13:33.046 --> 13:36.850
- Well, we need him to provide
in the next seven to 10 days

13:36.884 --> 13:39.819
or we're up poop creek
without a paddle.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.754
- Thank you, Miss Martha.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.091
Daniel.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.901
Just leave the door open.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.078
- You read all these?

14:06.646 --> 14:07.747
- Most of 'em.

14:07.780 --> 14:08.848
Yeah.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.017
- [Daniel] Hmm.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.754
- [Eli] Want to take a seat?

14:14.787 --> 14:16.389
- No, I'm all right.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.897
- I've been thinking about ya.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.472
Lunch is served.

14:33.907 --> 14:34.908
Sit down.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.789
So, where are you from?

14:49.822 --> 14:51.424
- A lot of places.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.333
You're smart, ain't you?

15:01.969 --> 15:03.703
- Well, I went to Harvard.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.537
So, no.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.541
- [Daniel] I'm not dumb.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.342
- [Eli] I know.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.343
That was a joke.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.879
- I know what Harvard is.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.481
It's for smart folks.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.716
- Well, I have met a lot
of dumb, and smart, people.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.951
Even at Harvard.

15:19.886 --> 15:23.656
- I'm not educated,
but I'm smart.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.757
I read Prast.

15:25.993 --> 15:26.793
- Who?

15:29.062 --> 15:29.862
- Prast.

15:31.331 --> 15:34.467
The last guy that
told me I was dumb,

15:35.702 --> 15:38.771
I told him to shut
the fuck up. (laughs)

15:38.805 --> 15:41.841
He told me he was smart
'cause he reads Prast.

15:41.874 --> 15:46.079
So, now I try to go to the
library every week, or so,

15:47.080 --> 15:49.849
and read a little Prast.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.518
He's French, you know?

15:51.551 --> 15:52.986
- I think you might mean...

15:53.020 --> 15:56.356
- You never played football
in the mud, did you?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.661
- No, I have not.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.163
- My mama dropped
me at this orphanage

16:03.196 --> 16:05.932
once for a couple of days.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.536
And it backed up on the
piece of old farmland.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.739
It had this dried out river bed.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.708
But, when it rained, it would
turn into a big old mud pit.

16:15.742 --> 16:19.146
There's nothing harder
than wading through the mud

16:19.179 --> 16:20.480
trying to catch a pass.

16:20.513 --> 16:24.717
Even if it's just a few
feet in front of you.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.920
That's what reading
Prast is like.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.927
- It's Proust, not Prast.

16:35.928 --> 16:36.929
Proust.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.301
- Proust.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.169
- Proust, yeah.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.002
Good.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.076
I got a place for you.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.444
- Yeah?

16:51.478 --> 16:52.279
- Um.

16:54.981 --> 16:55.782
Yeah.

16:58.151 --> 16:58.951
- Why?

17:01.888 --> 17:04.824
- Well, you said
you needed a place.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.673
- This'll do.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.042
(Eli laughs)

17:26.313 --> 17:28.014
This place yours?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.049
- Nah, it's my father's.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.788
He kept it from my mother.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.026
She used to disappear,
then wander back into town

17:40.059 --> 17:43.062
kind of drunk and
broke, you know?

17:45.998 --> 17:50.002
Southern Baptist preachers
can't have alcoholic wives.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.881
What happened to your hand?

18:03.116 --> 18:05.452
- You ever been in a fight?

18:07.154 --> 18:08.054
- Verbally.

18:08.855 --> 18:09.856
Spiritually.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.095
Do you want to clean that?

18:16.129 --> 18:17.397
A bandage?

18:17.430 --> 18:20.167
You can wash your
hands over here.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.909
See where the towels are.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.848
Ah, here we go.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.021
(Daniel grunting)

18:42.054 --> 18:43.055
Ah.

18:43.890 --> 18:44.691
Oh, man.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.271
- I got it, I got it.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.306
- All right.

19:07.013 --> 19:07.814
All right.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.417
Yep, sorry.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.119
Okay.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.197
There you go.

19:24.231 --> 19:24.997
You all right?

19:25.031 --> 19:25.832
- Yeah.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.736
- Let's make your bed, huh?

19:38.611 --> 19:40.813
Mind grabbing that corner?

19:43.450 --> 19:44.251
All right.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.354
Just tuck it in tight.

19:51.123 --> 19:51.924
I got it.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.231
(lighter flicks)

19:58.265 --> 20:01.167
Do you mind not
doing that in here?

20:11.278 --> 20:12.279
All right.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.749
Well, there's a gas station
about a mile down the road

20:16.783 --> 20:18.184
if you need anything.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.988
I'll be back tomorrow
with some food.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.357
Glad this worked out, Daniel.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.874
Have a good night.

20:51.217 --> 20:53.653
(door shuts)

20:53.686 --> 20:56.689
(slow violin music)

21:15.274 --> 21:16.809
What are you doing?

21:19.211 --> 21:21.381
- Come on, put the book down.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.181
- Oh, yeah?

21:22.214 --> 21:23.215
- Mm-hmm.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.291
- All right.

21:33.159 --> 21:35.027
Let's get the pillow.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.228
- Right, right,
right, right, right.

21:36.262 --> 21:37.063
Yeah.

21:38.264 --> 21:39.666
- [Eli] All right.

21:42.535 --> 21:43.302
- You never.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.237
There we go, like that.

21:45.271 --> 21:45.938
- Feels good?

21:45.972 --> 21:47.006
- It's good.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.341
It feels great, that feels
great, that feels great.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.175
- Okay.

22:00.052 --> 22:00.820
- Ow.

22:00.853 --> 22:01.754
- You okay?

22:01.788 --> 22:02.922
- Mm-hmm, I'm fine, I'm fine.

22:02.955 --> 22:03.856
It's fine, it's fine.

22:03.890 --> 22:04.757
I'm just a little stiff.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.359
- I don't know.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.427
- It's just a little stiff,
it's just a little stiff.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.361
Come on.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.195
- No.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.464
I don't want you to get hurt.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.433
- I won't get hurt, I promise.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.134
- [Eli] Nope, nope.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.292
(soft music)

22:47.967 --> 22:49.268
- Oh, Preacher.

22:49.301 --> 22:52.972
Emmanuel Baptist
drew 800 this week.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.306
- Does it tell how
many of those 800

22:54.340 --> 22:55.575
for the presence of the Lord?

22:55.608 --> 22:56.876
- Actually, it does.

22:56.909 --> 23:00.947
These are the saved
and rededicated totals.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.316
- Well, Brother Aaron
gives out door prizes.

23:04.350 --> 23:05.217
- Oh, Pastor.

23:05.251 --> 23:07.554
There's somebody here for you.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.393
- [Eli] Jimmy.

23:18.931 --> 23:22.001
- I'm sort of having,
like, feelings.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.940
- What sort of feelings?

23:27.974 --> 23:29.241
- Missy.

23:29.275 --> 23:30.309
- [Eli] Who?

23:30.342 --> 23:31.410
- Missy Swan.

23:34.747 --> 23:35.948
- Your cousin?

23:38.751 --> 23:39.752
Well, Jimmy.

23:41.153 --> 23:42.655
Aside from the societal stigma,

23:42.689 --> 23:45.324
there seem to be some
health repercussions

23:45.357 --> 23:47.827
for copulating with a relative.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.932
- What does the Bible say?

23:52.965 --> 23:53.766
- Bible?

23:56.002 --> 23:57.236
That's a great
question, actually,

23:57.269 --> 23:59.672
because in Genesis chapter 29,

24:00.973 --> 24:03.776
Jacob marries his
first two cousins.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.147
They are children of
the 12 tribes of Israel

24:08.180 --> 24:10.650
that from that line came Jesus.

24:13.319 --> 24:14.587
- [Jimmy] Jesus was inbred?

24:14.621 --> 24:16.188
- I guess so.

24:16.222 --> 24:19.358
I guess the farther you look
back we're all kind of inbred.

24:19.391 --> 24:20.192
Yeah.

24:21.460 --> 24:25.031
- [Jimmy] So, there ain't
nothing wrong with it.

24:26.533 --> 24:30.637
- No, that's not what
I was trying to say.

24:30.670 --> 24:34.073
The church looks down
on premarital sex.

24:37.443 --> 24:38.410
- Okay.

24:38.444 --> 24:40.312
Well, what should I do?

24:41.247 --> 24:43.015
- Maybe you should Google it.

24:43.049 --> 24:47.253
See if marrying your cousin
is even legal in Arkansas

24:48.087 --> 24:49.689
and then we'll go from there.

24:53.159 --> 24:56.162
(slow violin music)

25:30.296 --> 25:32.031
- See, the key to
making deer steak

25:32.064 --> 25:35.267
is the way you handle
the meat, right?

25:36.402 --> 25:39.371
Requires a certain
tenderness, you know?

25:39.405 --> 25:41.173
You don't want to pound it.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.508
You want to message it flat

25:42.541 --> 25:44.711
so that you can break
up the muscle tissue

25:44.744 --> 25:48.547
without damaging the
texture of the venison.

25:50.116 --> 25:50.917
- Right.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.988
Trevor, you know I'm
a vegetarian, right?

25:56.022 --> 25:58.390
(laughs)

25:58.424 --> 26:00.226
Are you F-ing serious?

26:02.428 --> 26:03.462
You know what?

26:03.495 --> 26:05.965
I got chicken in the freezer.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.468
- Lord Jesus, thank
you for this food.

26:09.501 --> 26:13.505
Thanks for Trevor and for
the deer that he shot.

26:17.944 --> 26:22.148
I praise you and please bless
this food for our nourishment.

26:22.815 --> 26:23.482
Jesus name pray, amen.

26:23.515 --> 26:24.416
- Amen.

26:24.450 --> 26:25.517
- Amen.

26:25.551 --> 26:26.518
- Dig in.

26:26.552 --> 26:27.754
You need a steak knife?

26:27.787 --> 26:28.587
- Ha-ha.

26:31.523 --> 26:33.826
Trevor, why am I here?

26:33.860 --> 26:36.629
- Okay, they've been cheatin'.

26:36.663 --> 26:37.830
- [Eli] Who's been cheatin'?

26:37.864 --> 26:39.598
- Brother Aaron.

26:39.632 --> 26:42.568
He's been doctoring
his attendance records.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.437
Emmanuel Baptist ain't
been drawing 800,

26:45.471 --> 26:47.239
they've barely
been breaking six.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.575
Which is good, dang good.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.977
But, that don't matter.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.780
What matters is he's gonna
be kicked out of the board.

26:53.813 --> 26:54.613
High five.

26:57.016 --> 26:57.784
- Good.

26:57.817 --> 26:58.584
(Trevor laughs)

26:58.617 --> 26:59.686
That's great.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.589
Well, I guess we won't have
to have the revival after all.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.524
- Not have our annual revival?

27:05.557 --> 27:07.026
- It's only annual if
we do it every year.

27:07.059 --> 27:07.994
So, we haven't even started.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.629
- Now is the time to strike.

27:10.663 --> 27:12.564
We've got an angry
congregation of 600

27:12.598 --> 27:15.668
just looking for a place to go.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.737
- That's not why I preach.

27:17.770 --> 27:20.840
- If you don't preach to reach
as many people as you can,

27:20.873 --> 27:23.609
to really change
folks, then why?

27:24.811 --> 27:27.446
- You know, I'm
working to change

27:27.479 --> 27:30.482
the collective
consciousness of this town.

27:30.516 --> 27:33.052
- What the F does that mean?

27:33.085 --> 27:36.422
- [Eli] I'm simply saying
that I think a revival

27:36.455 --> 27:37.824
is not the direction that I...

27:37.857 --> 27:40.259
- You have something in you,

27:41.460 --> 27:43.863
something that makes
you want to fail.

27:43.896 --> 27:44.663
- [Eli] No, that is not...

27:44.697 --> 27:46.699
- Your mama had it, too.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.101
- What do you know
about my mother?

27:49.135 --> 27:51.670
- Hey, I don't mean
any disrespect.

27:51.704 --> 27:54.506
I'll I'm sayin'
is I have it, too.

27:57.476 --> 27:58.677
It's in me, too.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.448
I called it the self death.

28:03.716 --> 28:07.053
Look, I had a beautiful
wife, a daughter,

28:07.086 --> 28:08.587
a great job driving trucks,

28:08.620 --> 28:09.922
and a pretty classy
double wide at home,

28:09.956 --> 28:13.692
but my self death
wouldn't let me be happy.

28:15.728 --> 28:17.396
It made me resort
to drink, and drugs,

28:17.429 --> 28:19.398
and leather lizards on the road.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.699
- Leather what?

28:22.268 --> 28:25.037
- It's a woman who'll give
you a handy, or a sucky suck,

28:25.071 --> 28:27.039
for $5 at a truck stop.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.240
- [Eli] Oh.

28:28.274 --> 28:29.341
- Just forget that.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.743
- [Eli] Okay.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.912
- It's all behind me now.

28:34.446 --> 28:37.616
My wife took my baby girl,
and my Crock-Pot, and left.

28:37.649 --> 28:40.486
I didn't know where they
was or what they was doing.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.521
I lost my job because of a DUI.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.958
And then it was just suddenly
me and my double wide.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.726
Couldn't afford the payments
on that after a while,

28:47.760 --> 28:49.896
so I lost that, too.

28:49.929 --> 28:53.699
So, it turns out I was just
passing out drunk every night

28:53.732 --> 28:55.667
on my mama's couch and I
decided that is was either

28:55.701 --> 28:58.304
time to kill myself or change.

28:59.505 --> 29:02.408
So, I got down on
my hands and knees,

29:04.076 --> 29:06.145
and I asked God for hope.

29:07.479 --> 29:08.280
Not help.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.016
Hope.

29:11.217 --> 29:14.453
'Cause if I had that,
I could help myself.

29:14.486 --> 29:17.456
The next day I get a
letter in the mail.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.959
It's from my baby girl.

29:19.992 --> 29:22.528
She's eight years old.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.763
She wanted to come visit me.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.934
So, I got myself cleaned up

29:27.967 --> 29:29.802
and employed at
your daddy's church.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.138
And I'll have you know that
my wife got on drugs real bad

29:32.171 --> 29:35.842
last year and now my
baby girl lives with me.

29:38.644 --> 29:39.879
- [Eli] Congratulations.

29:39.912 --> 29:40.913
- God saves.

29:42.714 --> 29:44.516
- He certainly does.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.519
- [Trevor] We're gonna
need changing room tents

29:47.553 --> 29:48.687
for all the chorus members.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.189
You know wat' we gotta
get on right away?

29:50.222 --> 29:51.423
That's Porta Potties.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.392
Those things book out
months in advance.

29:53.425 --> 29:54.693
- I just, I'm thinking.

29:54.726 --> 29:55.561
- Chairs you don't
need to worry about.

29:55.594 --> 29:56.829
I got that covered.

29:56.863 --> 29:57.997
I got a buddy getting
it from the Moose Hall.

29:58.030 --> 30:01.000
He is gonna get 'em from
the Lion's Club, too.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.301
- I was thinking like...

30:02.334 --> 30:04.236
I don't a revival
right now is...

30:04.270 --> 30:06.372
- Listen, the staff's already
on board to work overtime.

30:06.405 --> 30:07.306
- No, I'm just saying...

30:07.339 --> 30:08.040
- And I've already checked on...

30:08.074 --> 30:10.109
- Stop interrupting me!

30:10.142 --> 30:11.410
I have been trying
to talk all day

30:11.443 --> 30:12.611
and you just won't
listen, all right?

30:12.644 --> 30:14.546
I am the pastor of
this church, all right?

30:14.580 --> 30:18.784
And I am trying to bring
some progressive thinking,

30:20.052 --> 30:22.121
some sincere faith, to this
town and no one understands me.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.790
My goal, or my hope, is to
show these people how limited

30:24.823 --> 30:26.558
their perception
of God really is.

30:26.592 --> 30:29.728
They go through life
thinking that God wants them

30:29.761 --> 30:31.530
to quit their jobs,
or go on vacation,

30:31.563 --> 30:33.832
or divorce their spouse.

30:33.866 --> 30:36.402
They assume they know what
He is thinking, or worse.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.737
They think that whatever
pops into their minds,

30:38.770 --> 30:40.873
that is what He is thinking.

30:40.907 --> 30:42.741
They have personalized
their god to the point

30:42.774 --> 30:44.977
of becoming their own god.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.351
- Okay.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.585
- I think I didn't
say that right.

30:53.619 --> 30:54.620
- No, I like this.

30:54.653 --> 30:55.854
I like this.

30:55.888 --> 30:57.423
You just spoke with passion.

30:57.456 --> 30:58.490
- But, you heard what
I said though, right?

30:58.524 --> 30:59.291
- Doesn't matter what you said.

30:59.325 --> 31:00.092
- No, it does.

31:00.126 --> 31:01.793
- You meant it.

31:01.827 --> 31:02.895
That's what we found, you
meant it and you got mad.

31:02.929 --> 31:04.196
That's what people want.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.165
That's what the board
is gonna respond to.

31:06.198 --> 31:09.001
Sinners in the hand of an
angry god kind of stuff.

31:09.035 --> 31:11.270
You gotta preach
like you can't stop.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.005
Like you'll die if you do.

31:13.039 --> 31:16.208
Like your soul is on fire
and you're gonna burn in Hell

31:16.242 --> 31:19.912
for all eternity if
you don't reach people.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.850
- [Aaron On Radio]
Hey, I've sinned.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.986
I've done things I will
regret till my last breath.

31:27.019 --> 31:28.620
Nobody's perfect.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.656
We've all fallen short
of the the glory of God.

31:30.689 --> 31:31.690
There is none righteous.

31:31.723 --> 31:32.658
No, not one.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.526
And you know what?

31:34.560 --> 31:37.563
(slow violin music)

32:28.880 --> 32:30.949
- [Daniel] Is this
absolutely necessary?

32:30.983 --> 32:33.152
- You gotta look presentable.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.286
- [Daniel] Why?

32:34.320 --> 32:36.588
- So you can get a job.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.157
- [Daniel] Why do I need a job?

32:38.190 --> 32:40.159
- So you can pay me rent.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.894
- Oh. (laughs)

32:44.196 --> 32:46.865
- [Eli] When's the last time
you got your hair cut anyway?

32:46.898 --> 32:47.933
- It's been a while.

32:47.966 --> 32:51.103
- [Eli] Yeah? (laughs)

32:51.970 --> 32:54.673
- My mama used to cut it.

32:54.706 --> 32:55.974
- [Eli] Oh, yeah?

33:00.346 --> 33:01.247
- She OD'd.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.951
- I'm sorry to hear that.

33:05.984 --> 33:06.952
- It's all right.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.587
It's not your fault.

33:10.022 --> 33:11.990
(Eli groans)

33:12.024 --> 33:12.991
What?

33:13.025 --> 33:15.727
- I just cut myself
a little bit.

33:25.037 --> 33:27.739
You should come to
church on Sunday.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.641
I'm having a great sermon.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.177
So, what happened to faith?

33:31.210 --> 33:32.444
Not understand God.

33:32.478 --> 33:36.082
How not to be when you
don't understand it.

33:37.683 --> 33:38.984
I really think.

33:43.889 --> 33:44.690
We can't.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.193
We can't.

34:16.622 --> 34:19.625
(breathing heavily)

34:50.222 --> 34:51.022
Oh.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.297
(groaning)

35:35.000 --> 35:37.135
(laughing)

36:05.364 --> 36:06.164
Sorry.

36:07.098 --> 36:08.099
Sorry.

36:09.201 --> 36:10.202
I'm sorry.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.409
You're so beautiful.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.111
So beautiful.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.112
- Shut up.

36:21.146 --> 36:21.913
- You are.

36:21.947 --> 36:22.714
- Shut up.

36:22.748 --> 36:23.549
- You are.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.247
- [Aaron On Radio] Some people
say you can't wear shorts.

36:55.281 --> 36:56.882
You can wear shorts.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.184
As long as they
aren't short shorts.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.586
Y'all don't need
me to remind you

37:00.619 --> 37:02.120
it gets hotter than
hell down here.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.154
Shorts are fine.

37:03.188 --> 37:04.189
Here's the deal.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.092
They gotta go down
to your knees.

37:23.975 --> 37:24.776
- Hey.

37:30.181 --> 37:31.049
Sorry.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.150
- Where were you last night?

37:32.183 --> 37:34.820
- I fell asleep
writing my sermon.

37:37.088 --> 37:37.856
- I called you.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.090
- I know.

37:39.124 --> 37:41.793
- I called you like
five times, Eli.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.028
- I turned my ringer off

37:43.061 --> 37:46.031
because I didn't want
to be distracted.

37:47.333 --> 37:48.334
I'm sorry.

37:53.238 --> 37:54.039
Hey.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.877
You're a little tense.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.111
- Yeah, well.

38:00.145 --> 38:03.315
I didn't sleep very
well last night.

38:03.349 --> 38:06.452
- Hey, could we try something?

38:06.485 --> 38:10.689
Can you go out in the living
room and sit on the couch?

38:11.256 --> 38:12.290
- No.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.091
- I want to do something.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.025
I want to do something.

38:14.059 --> 38:14.793
- What about these dishes?

38:14.826 --> 38:16.395
- I'll do the dishes.

38:16.428 --> 38:17.429
I'll do 'em.

38:20.231 --> 38:21.232
Just go.

38:22.501 --> 38:23.301
Just go.

38:23.335 --> 38:24.536
- Okay, okay.

38:24.570 --> 38:25.504
Okay, okay.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.310
Babe, you should be
getting to work by now.

38:32.344 --> 38:33.445
And I've got so much to do.

38:33.479 --> 38:34.813
I've gotta get this
whole house ready

38:34.846 --> 38:37.248
for those women coming over.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.219
What is all this?

38:41.252 --> 38:42.621
- You know what this is?

38:42.654 --> 38:44.356
- What are you doing?

38:51.397 --> 38:52.798
You're ridiculous.

38:54.766 --> 38:58.970
- You know what's ridiculous
is how lucky I am to have you.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.714
(moaning)

39:10.348 --> 39:12.384
(door opens)

39:12.418 --> 39:14.720
Jimmy, can you knock, please?

39:18.624 --> 39:19.925
- It's illegal.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.293
- What is?

39:22.327 --> 39:24.262
- [Jimmy] Marrying your
first cousin in Arkansas.

39:24.295 --> 39:25.363
It's illegal.

39:25.397 --> 39:26.398
- Oh.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.035
Sorry to hear that.

39:31.102 --> 39:33.371
- Well, what should I do now?

39:38.644 --> 39:39.978
- I don't know.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.615
- [Jimmy] But,
you're a preacher.

39:46.585 --> 39:49.855
(uptempo violin music)

40:08.173 --> 40:10.476
(coughing)

40:14.045 --> 40:17.048
(people chattering)

40:19.417 --> 40:22.020
- She has had a sad, sad life.

40:22.988 --> 40:23.922
- It's true.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.323
So true.

40:25.356 --> 40:28.426
- For her it's that husband
seen galavanting all over town

40:28.460 --> 40:29.861
like a mule in heat.

40:29.895 --> 40:34.032
And then, her youngest son
gets to smoking marijuana.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.035
And now, her other son, Roger.

40:39.805 --> 40:43.274
Well, I'm not the type of
woman who likes to talk

40:43.308 --> 40:47.513
behind people's backs, so we'll
just leave it right there.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.584
- Miss Martha, we all
know you're gonna say it,

40:52.618 --> 40:56.822
So why don't you just
go ahead and say it now?

40:58.056 --> 41:00.992
- He was seen coming
out of the Tight End.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.994
Cheating husband,
marijuana smoking son,

41:03.028 --> 41:07.232
and now her other son seen
coming out of a gay sports bar.

41:07.432 --> 41:10.702
- Miss Martha, what exactly
is your prayer request?

41:10.736 --> 41:13.905
- That Miss Angela
will find the strength

41:13.939 --> 41:16.407
to get her house in order.

41:16.441 --> 41:20.646
And let's pray for Missy's
self-esteem issues.

41:21.513 --> 41:22.881
And while we're at it,

41:22.914 --> 41:25.817
let's pray that Brother
Eli will figure out a way

41:25.851 --> 41:28.587
to build the church
back to prominence

41:28.620 --> 41:31.422
like it was when his
daddy was running things.

41:31.456 --> 41:32.223
- [Woman] Amen.

41:32.257 --> 41:33.692
Mm-hmm.

41:33.725 --> 41:36.728
(slow violin music)

41:59.350 --> 42:00.552
- Sorry.

42:00.586 --> 42:02.320
- No, you're not.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.221
- I'm not sorry.

42:03.254 --> 42:04.055
- I know.

42:07.092 --> 42:08.694
- You do this a lot?

42:10.361 --> 42:11.162
- Never.

42:14.900 --> 42:15.701
Do you?

42:18.804 --> 42:20.138
- Yeah, I have.

42:23.208 --> 42:26.812
I knew the second I saw
you at that potluck.

42:28.580 --> 42:30.181
You had that look.

42:31.282 --> 42:32.283
- What look?

42:33.985 --> 42:34.920
- You know.

42:36.487 --> 42:38.389
It's hard to explain.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.492
It's more of a feeling.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.496
It reminds me of making meth.

42:48.166 --> 42:52.370
- How does it feel like
you're making meth?

42:53.104 --> 42:54.572
- 'Cause it's dangerous.

42:55.540 --> 42:56.742
It feels so hot.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.377
If you cook it too long, man,

42:59.410 --> 43:00.511
it'll just blow up
right in your face.

43:00.545 --> 43:02.681
- [Eli] Do you know
how to make meth?

43:02.714 --> 43:03.649
- Yeah.

43:05.450 --> 43:09.054
- Hey, you're not making
meth here, are you?

43:13.424 --> 43:15.627
You're not making meth here?

43:18.529 --> 43:20.031
Do you know what'll happen to me

43:20.065 --> 43:23.735
if they found out I was
holding a drug dealer here?

43:24.602 --> 43:25.503
- I didn't sell it.

43:25.536 --> 43:27.939
- I'll lose my church, Daniel.

43:27.973 --> 43:30.976
- Oh, if you're so
worried about your church,

43:31.009 --> 43:33.611
what are you doing here
in the first place?

43:33.645 --> 43:34.445
Huh?

43:36.414 --> 43:38.549
- I don't normally do this.

43:39.951 --> 43:43.621
I mean, I have these
feelings, but I normally...

43:45.757 --> 43:48.359
Normally I can stuff 'em down.

43:51.296 --> 43:54.599
I read the Bible daily
and I talk to God.

43:57.669 --> 43:59.370
I ask Him to take it,

44:01.472 --> 44:03.709
to take it away from me, but.

44:05.777 --> 44:08.179
- Did you talk to Him today?

44:09.580 --> 44:10.381
- No.

44:12.650 --> 44:13.451
- Too bad.

44:20.025 --> 44:23.328
- Hey, you cannot
make meth here, okay?

44:25.697 --> 44:26.631
No, don't, don't.

44:26.664 --> 44:27.699
- Okay.

44:27.733 --> 44:28.666
- Hey, you cannot
make meth here.

44:28.700 --> 44:29.667
- Okay.

44:29.701 --> 44:30.468
- Okay?

44:30.501 --> 44:31.803
- Okay.

44:31.837 --> 44:33.638
- Give me that.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.206
I want to try it.

44:36.274 --> 44:37.175
- Careful.

44:37.208 --> 44:38.209
- I'm not gonna be careful.

44:38.243 --> 44:39.644
- It's about done.

44:41.312 --> 44:42.680
Okay, give me that.

44:42.714 --> 44:43.982
- Oh, I don't like it.

44:44.015 --> 44:44.816
- Okay.

44:50.621 --> 44:52.123
- You cannot make meth here.

44:52.157 --> 44:53.524
I'm not kidding you
about that, okay?

44:53.558 --> 44:55.126
- I'm not clear on
what you're saying.

44:55.160 --> 44:56.661
- I mean it, don't.

44:57.763 --> 45:00.565
(choir singing)

45:28.559 --> 45:31.362
(phone vibrating)

45:34.332 --> 45:35.666
- Hey, baby girl.

45:37.869 --> 45:39.104
Oh, no.

45:39.137 --> 45:41.773
Daddy misses you, too.

45:41.807 --> 45:42.740
Absolutely.

45:43.942 --> 45:47.245
I can't wait to hear
what's going on at camp.

45:47.278 --> 45:48.880
Did you kill anything?

45:48.914 --> 45:49.714
Really?

45:50.816 --> 45:52.818
All right, that's my girl.

46:02.727 --> 46:06.164
- Hey, I put some extra
onions on it for you.

46:06.197 --> 46:06.998
- Thanks.

46:25.450 --> 46:26.717
You want an over-under knot?

46:26.751 --> 46:27.986
- Jimmy, this ain't supposed
to take all morning.

46:28.019 --> 46:29.520
- [Jimmy] I know,
but it's broken.

46:29.554 --> 46:31.756
- Just tie it tight like a
cheerleader's grip on her Bible.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.191
Sorry, Preacher.

46:34.192 --> 46:35.793
What do you think?

46:38.029 --> 46:39.764
- Looks great.

46:39.797 --> 46:40.798
- All right.

46:40.832 --> 46:43.001
Well, you have a
good day, Preacher.

46:43.034 --> 46:43.935
You know what?

46:43.969 --> 46:45.203
Let's get it as high as we can.

46:45.236 --> 46:46.804
I want God to see it
from his living room.

46:46.838 --> 46:47.973
- [Jimmy] Higher?

46:48.006 --> 46:49.774
- Yeah, get on up there.

46:49.807 --> 46:53.578
- [Host] Trevor Pickins tells
me about your annual revival.

46:53.611 --> 46:54.946
- It's not really annual.

46:54.980 --> 46:58.316
- Okay, that's just
what Trevor told me.

46:58.349 --> 46:59.750
He told me it was an annual.

46:59.784 --> 47:00.718
- It's the first one.

47:00.751 --> 47:02.720
- Ah. (laughs)

47:02.753 --> 47:06.357
That Trevor, he's a
funny guy, ain't he?

47:06.391 --> 47:07.725
- He really loves the church.

47:07.758 --> 47:09.861
- Yeah, I could tell
you some stories.

47:09.895 --> 47:13.731
They would get us fired,
arrested, and divorced nowadays.

47:13.764 --> 47:16.334
- Yeah, well Trevor's
already divorced.

47:16.367 --> 47:17.168
So.

47:18.669 --> 47:22.507
- On that note, let's hear a
little word from our sponsors.

47:23.374 --> 47:24.876
I ain't a dentist, Reverend.

47:24.910 --> 47:28.113
I can't pull no more
teeth, all right?

47:30.048 --> 47:31.382
And we're back.

47:32.250 --> 47:33.751
I miss your father.

47:33.784 --> 47:34.752
I remember him.

47:34.785 --> 47:36.154
He was a great man.

47:36.187 --> 47:37.555
I used to go to his church,
in fact, when I was a kid.

47:37.588 --> 47:38.990
But, now I'm with Brother Aaron.

47:39.024 --> 47:41.026
- Well, First Baptist isn't
my father's church anymore.

47:41.059 --> 47:42.593
It's mine.

47:42.627 --> 47:46.797
And with this revival, I'm
taking it in a new direction.

47:47.933 --> 47:48.699
- [Host] And what direction
is that, Reverend?

47:48.733 --> 47:49.434
- Forward.

47:50.001 --> 47:51.836
- What exactly does that mean?

47:51.869 --> 47:54.005
- Let me ask you, Jim.

47:54.039 --> 47:56.241
Why'd you leave First Baptist?

47:56.274 --> 47:57.842
- Well, my kids.

47:57.875 --> 48:01.379
My kids, they heard Emmanuel
Baptist was exciting.

48:01.412 --> 48:03.814
And whatever keeps my
kids' interest in the Lord

48:03.848 --> 48:05.483
and off their
phones, am I right?

48:05.516 --> 48:06.284
- No.

48:06.317 --> 48:07.218
No, Jim.

48:07.252 --> 48:08.519
I don't think you are right.

48:08.553 --> 48:11.056
You know, Brother Aaron
might have the cameras,

48:11.089 --> 48:12.857
and the lights, and the
screens, and all that,

48:12.890 --> 48:14.825
but I'm not Brother Aaron.

48:14.859 --> 48:15.726
I am not Brother Aaron.

48:15.760 --> 48:16.827
I will never be Brother Aaron.

48:16.861 --> 48:19.864
I do not want to
be Brother Aaron.

48:19.897 --> 48:22.100
I'm trying to make something
true, something real.

48:22.133 --> 48:24.669
And it's hard being a pastor.

48:26.137 --> 48:26.938
It's hard.

48:28.139 --> 48:30.275
It's hard to be a Christian.

48:30.308 --> 48:31.876
It's hard to know
what God wants.

48:31.909 --> 48:35.913
And when you do know what God
wants, it's hard to do it.

48:36.781 --> 48:37.515
Jim, let me ask you.

48:37.548 --> 48:39.084
Do you ever feel alone?

48:39.117 --> 48:39.884
- Yeah, sure.

48:39.917 --> 48:40.885
- Of course you do.

48:40.918 --> 48:42.853
We all feel alone.

48:42.887 --> 48:44.189
We all feel lost.

48:45.156 --> 48:46.824
We all feel scared.

48:46.857 --> 48:48.559
We all feel darkness.

48:50.661 --> 48:52.964
We get caught up in
the small day-to-day

48:52.998 --> 48:55.400
and we lose sight of eternity.

48:57.502 --> 48:58.269
We make mistakes.

48:58.303 --> 48:59.437
I make mistakes.

48:59.470 --> 49:00.505
I've made so many mistakes.

49:00.538 --> 49:02.240
I'm not perfect.

49:02.273 --> 49:03.941
I'm far from perfect.

49:05.143 --> 49:08.913
But, God's love, and His
grace, and His power,

49:10.615 --> 49:12.950
are bigger than that.

49:12.984 --> 49:17.188
And that's what the revival
is about next weekend.

49:18.389 --> 49:21.859
It's about imperfect
people coming together

49:21.892 --> 49:24.162
to feel the power and love.

49:24.195 --> 49:27.865
And they need the strength
to keep on living.

49:27.898 --> 49:30.201
Who doesn't want that, right?

49:34.339 --> 49:35.206
- [Jim] All right.

49:35.240 --> 49:36.207
That's gonna do it for us.

49:36.241 --> 49:38.543
Remember, two weeks from Sunday.

49:38.576 --> 49:40.911
First Baptist Church Revival.

49:42.580 --> 49:45.150
(slow violin music)

49:45.183 --> 49:48.419
- [Aaron] Woe unto you,
you scribes and Pharisees.

49:48.453 --> 49:49.720
Hypocrites.

49:49.754 --> 49:51.989
For you they're like
whited sepulchers

49:52.023 --> 49:54.159
which indeed appear
beautiful outward,

49:54.192 --> 49:57.962
but are full of dead man's
bones and all uncleanness.

49:57.995 --> 50:01.299
Even so, ye outwardly
appear righteous unto man,

50:01.332 --> 50:04.969
but within you're full of
hypocrisy and inequity.

50:05.002 --> 50:08.306
Woe unto you scribes
and Pharisees.

50:08.339 --> 50:09.907
Hypocrites.

50:09.940 --> 50:13.144
Fill ye up then the measures
of your fathers, you serpents.

50:13.178 --> 50:15.046
You generation of vipers.

50:15.080 --> 50:18.583
How can you escape
the damnation of Hell?

50:58.489 --> 51:00.858
(door closes)

51:00.891 --> 51:02.960
- [Eli] You're up late.

51:02.993 --> 51:04.362
- [June] Where were you?

51:04.395 --> 51:06.697
- [Eli] I was at church.

51:06.731 --> 51:08.833
- Something came for you.

51:40.765 --> 51:43.501
- This is not what
it looks like.

51:48.038 --> 51:49.039
- Well, hey.

51:50.308 --> 51:51.542
Why did you do this?

51:51.576 --> 51:53.878
- Sometimes men embrace.

51:53.911 --> 51:55.946
- Don't lie to me, Eli.

51:55.980 --> 51:57.515
- June, June, June.

52:01.085 --> 52:03.020
I care about you so much.

52:03.053 --> 52:04.255
I love you.

52:04.289 --> 52:05.156
I love you.

52:06.191 --> 52:07.858
I just got confused.

52:07.892 --> 52:12.096
I get happy, but this
thing I know is wrong

52:12.930 --> 52:15.065
and I don't know what I'm doing.

52:15.099 --> 52:17.235
I question things, but.

52:17.268 --> 52:18.703
- I can't do this.

52:18.736 --> 52:20.205
- June, June, June.

52:21.071 --> 52:22.907
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

52:22.940 --> 52:24.074
I'm so sorry.

52:25.343 --> 52:26.777
I've sinned.

52:26.811 --> 52:31.015
I'm a sinner, but I'm
gonna fix it, all right?

52:31.716 --> 52:32.750
I'm gonna fix it.

52:32.783 --> 52:34.051
I'm back.

52:34.084 --> 52:36.321
Trust me, I will fix it.

52:36.354 --> 52:37.555
I will fix it.

52:39.190 --> 52:40.391
I will fix it.

52:50.301 --> 52:53.604
(uptempo violin music)

53:08.553 --> 53:09.420
- [Aaron] Listen, church.

53:09.454 --> 53:10.621
When you go out soul winning,

53:10.655 --> 53:12.189
a lot of you are walking
around, excuse me,

53:12.223 --> 53:14.792
but a lot of you are
walking around like losers.

53:14.825 --> 53:16.227
And, hello.

53:16.261 --> 53:19.330
It's called soul
winning, not soul losing.

53:20.798 --> 53:22.132
You know, you think no
one's gonna listen to you.

53:22.166 --> 53:24.101
Do you think Christ
thought no one was gonna?

53:24.134 --> 53:26.170
I can tell you, He
was not a loser.

53:26.203 --> 53:28.439
You think Christ assumes
folks at your job

53:28.473 --> 53:29.640
aren't gonna get saved?

53:29.674 --> 53:31.976
You think Christ
assumes folks at Walmart

53:32.009 --> 53:33.378
aren't gonna get saved?

53:33.411 --> 53:35.580
I've seen more folks saved
at Walmart than church.

53:35.613 --> 53:37.114
Praise God.

53:37.147 --> 53:38.916
You will be eternally
surprised by who gets saved

53:38.949 --> 53:40.918
and where they get saved.

53:40.951 --> 53:42.186
Look, I do this, too.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.354
I look at a fella
coming out of a bar

53:43.388 --> 53:44.755
and I think that is
the last man on earth

53:44.789 --> 53:45.823
who is gonna get saved.

53:45.856 --> 53:47.024
And guess you what?

53:47.057 --> 53:49.193
There I see him on
Sunday and he got saved

53:49.226 --> 53:51.529
and I start thinking,
what do you guys say?

53:51.562 --> 53:54.399
But, there ain't no way
he's gonna live for God.

53:54.432 --> 53:56.166
I can't really see him
getting into church

53:56.200 --> 53:58.235
or making bigger
changes in his life.

53:58.269 --> 54:01.205
And lo and behold,
God changes people

54:01.238 --> 54:04.642
and the spirit of God has the
power to change the heart.

54:04.675 --> 54:06.210
Listen, church.

54:06.243 --> 54:09.947
When I go out soul winning,
I don't expect to fail.

54:09.980 --> 54:11.582
I expect to succeed.

54:18.122 --> 54:19.790
(door opens)

54:19.824 --> 54:20.591
- Hi.

54:20.625 --> 54:21.692
- Hey.

54:21.726 --> 54:22.493
- How you doing?

54:22.527 --> 54:23.328
- Okay.

54:24.194 --> 54:26.297
- Blessed to see you.

54:26.331 --> 54:27.798
- Yeah.

54:27.832 --> 54:30.100
Brought you something.

54:30.134 --> 54:31.569
- What?

54:31.602 --> 54:34.238
- You don't have to go to the
library every week to read it.

54:34.271 --> 54:36.374
- I don't have anything for you.

54:36.407 --> 54:40.010
- Um, I gotta talk to
you about something.

54:42.279 --> 54:45.149
There's a picture
of us together.

54:49.620 --> 54:50.421
- So what?

54:57.362 --> 54:58.363
No.

54:59.864 --> 55:00.665
No.

55:02.467 --> 55:03.233
Not you.

55:05.235 --> 55:08.038
You said you wanted
to be with me.

55:11.509 --> 55:12.643
Listen to me.

55:15.112 --> 55:17.382
I have real feelings for you.

55:19.884 --> 55:22.186
- And I'm committed to God.

55:25.656 --> 55:26.491
- You're committed to God.

55:26.524 --> 55:27.324
- Yes.

55:30.260 --> 55:32.262
- So, why'd you fuck me?

55:34.365 --> 55:36.367
- What we did was wrong.

55:38.403 --> 55:40.405
It's against God's will.

55:42.272 --> 55:43.273
I'm ashamed.

55:49.313 --> 55:50.147
- You're ashamed?

55:50.180 --> 55:51.782
- [Eli] I'm ashamed.

55:52.817 --> 55:53.751
- Fuck you.

55:56.120 --> 55:56.921
Fuck you.

56:02.192 --> 56:03.894
- You have to go.

56:03.928 --> 56:07.131
- Eli, you want me to stay here.

56:07.164 --> 56:10.167
- Daniel, I will pray for you.

56:10.200 --> 56:14.405
I will pray for you every
day for the rest of my life.

56:24.114 --> 56:27.117
(slow violin music)

56:46.437 --> 56:50.040
We all try to understand
God in human terms.

56:51.241 --> 56:54.545
We personify things to
feel closer to them.

56:54.579 --> 56:58.549
We even put words and intentions
in our father's mouth.

56:58.583 --> 57:01.852
We think that he wants
us to buy a new car,

57:01.886 --> 57:05.222
to get a new house,
to get a new spouse.

57:07.958 --> 57:09.359
Can I get an amen?

57:16.100 --> 57:18.435
And we can read our Bibles.

57:19.904 --> 57:22.339
We can say our prayers.

57:22.372 --> 57:25.476
We can convene with
other Christians.

57:26.977 --> 57:30.214
But, does this give us
the right to say that we,

57:30.247 --> 57:34.318
the tiny and insignificant
creatures that we are,

57:35.520 --> 57:38.823
know what God wants in
any given situation?

57:40.825 --> 57:42.392
- [Trevor] Preacher?

57:42.426 --> 57:43.828
- Yes, Brother Trevor?

57:43.861 --> 57:45.129
- I love Jesus.

57:47.031 --> 57:47.832
- Yes.

57:49.066 --> 57:51.001
Yes, we know you love
Jesus, Brother Trevor.

57:51.035 --> 57:51.836
Thank you.

58:00.010 --> 58:01.512
I guess my point...

58:03.313 --> 58:06.316
What I'm trying to
say, maybe, is...

58:14.559 --> 58:16.761
There's someone who's come

58:17.962 --> 58:20.731
to break down our
perceptions of God.

58:21.932 --> 58:25.435
Someone who wants
to show us his love

58:25.469 --> 58:27.872
and his unimaginable wisdom.

58:30.575 --> 58:32.943
Do you know who that person is?

58:32.977 --> 58:33.744
- Jesus?

58:33.778 --> 58:34.545
- Who?

58:34.579 --> 58:35.412
- Jesus?

58:35.445 --> 58:36.413
- I said who.

58:36.446 --> 58:37.815
- [Jimmy] Jesus.

58:37.848 --> 58:39.416
- Who freed us of our sins?

58:39.449 --> 58:40.350
- Jesus.

58:40.384 --> 58:41.485
- [Eli] Whenever we need him?

58:41.518 --> 58:42.319
- [Trevor And Jimmy] Jesus.

58:42.352 --> 58:43.353
- Lord of Lords.

58:43.387 --> 58:44.154
- [Trevor] Jesus.

58:44.188 --> 58:45.122
- King of kings.

58:45.155 --> 58:45.923
- [Trevor] Jesus.

58:45.956 --> 58:46.924
- I said Jesus.

58:46.957 --> 58:47.725
- [Trevor] Jesus.

58:47.758 --> 58:48.525
- Jesus.

58:48.559 --> 58:49.526
- [Trevor] Jesus.

58:49.560 --> 58:50.327
- Jesus.

58:50.360 --> 58:51.295
- [Trevor] Jesus.

58:51.328 --> 58:52.462
- [All] Jesus!

58:52.496 --> 58:53.430
Jesus!

58:53.463 --> 58:54.464
Jesus!

58:54.498 --> 58:55.332
Jesus!

58:55.365 --> 58:56.433
Jesus!

58:56.466 --> 58:57.568
Jesus!

58:57.602 --> 58:58.402
Jesus!

59:01.338 --> 59:03.073
- May I help you, sir?

59:06.944 --> 59:08.212
- I'm a sinner.

59:11.415 --> 59:12.617
- He's a sinner.

59:13.718 --> 59:15.085
Amen.

59:15.119 --> 59:15.920
Amen.

59:18.222 --> 59:19.990
We're all sinners.

59:20.024 --> 59:23.994
We've all fallen short
of the glory of God.

59:24.028 --> 59:26.964
Go now knowing

59:26.997 --> 59:28.398
God is with you.

59:30.500 --> 59:33.604
That God forgives you
and he gave his only son

59:33.638 --> 59:34.504
to die for you.

59:34.538 --> 59:35.339
- I'm gay.

59:38.142 --> 59:40.745
I was with a man just yesterday.

59:41.646 --> 59:42.546
- All right, okay.

59:42.579 --> 59:44.514
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

59:44.548 --> 59:47.351
Are you sorry for
what you've done?

59:47.384 --> 59:50.187
Are you sorry for
what you've done?

59:50.220 --> 59:52.890
Do you believe Jesus Christ
is the way, the truth,

59:52.923 --> 59:54.625
and the life, and that
no one goes to the Father

59:54.659 --> 59:55.993
except through Him?

59:56.026 --> 59:56.794
- I do.

59:56.827 --> 59:57.728
- You do.

59:57.762 --> 59:59.496
You do.

59:59.529 --> 1:00:01.531
Lord, Lord, Jesus, Father.

1:00:05.636 --> 1:00:07.738
Come into this man's heart.

1:00:09.439 --> 1:00:11.141
Cleanse him from sin.

1:00:12.276 --> 1:00:14.645
Forgive his transgressions.

1:00:14.679 --> 1:00:17.181
Show him your love, your way.

1:00:18.582 --> 1:00:22.519
Help him to go forth a
new man with a new life.

1:00:22.552 --> 1:00:25.990
Give him the strength
to overcome temptation.

1:00:26.023 --> 1:00:28.092
The will to live for you.

1:00:29.894 --> 1:00:31.428
You are forgiven.

1:00:32.797 --> 1:00:35.399
(people gasp)

1:00:36.233 --> 1:00:37.768
Someone saved this man today.

1:00:37.802 --> 1:00:38.635
- Hallelujah!

1:00:38.669 --> 1:00:39.636
- Hallelujah!

1:00:39.670 --> 1:00:41.005
- Someone's pull.

1:00:41.038 --> 1:00:43.573
Someone's love is greater
than this man's sin.

1:00:43.607 --> 1:00:44.709
- Jesus, Jesus.

1:00:45.676 --> 1:00:47.644
(people chattering)

1:00:47.678 --> 1:00:48.746
- Hallelujah.

1:00:48.779 --> 1:00:50.280
Hallelujah.

1:00:50.314 --> 1:00:51.548
Jesus.

1:00:51.581 --> 1:00:52.582
Jesus.

1:00:53.383 --> 1:00:54.251
- [All] Jesus!

1:00:54.284 --> 1:00:55.219
Jesus!

1:00:55.252 --> 1:00:56.153
Jesus!

1:00:56.186 --> 1:00:57.021
Jesus!

1:00:57.054 --> 1:00:58.055
Jesus!

1:00:58.088 --> 1:00:59.023
Jesus!

1:00:59.056 --> 1:01:00.057
Jesus!

1:01:00.090 --> 1:01:01.158
Jesus!

1:01:01.191 --> 1:01:02.059
Jesus!

1:01:02.092 --> 1:01:03.093
Jesus!

1:01:03.127 --> 1:01:04.028
Jesus!

1:01:04.061 --> 1:01:06.596
- Brother Gary, hit the music.

1:01:06.630 --> 1:01:09.433
(choir singing)

1:01:15.472 --> 1:01:17.107
What the hell were you thinking?

1:01:17.141 --> 1:01:19.009
- Your people, your church,

1:01:19.043 --> 1:01:20.878
they believe in
forgiveness, right?

1:01:20.911 --> 1:01:22.246
You just gotta go to your god

1:01:22.279 --> 1:01:24.414
and say you're
sorry and that's it.

1:01:24.448 --> 1:01:25.682
So, that's what I did.

1:01:25.716 --> 1:01:26.683
I got up there and
I said I was sorry.

1:01:26.717 --> 1:01:27.885
You do the same thing.

1:01:27.918 --> 1:01:29.720
- [Eli] Yeah, it's
different for me though.

1:01:29.754 --> 1:01:30.821
- How?

1:01:30.855 --> 1:01:34.424
- Because people don't
want a pastor who sins.

1:01:43.868 --> 1:01:45.402
Go get your stuff.

1:01:45.435 --> 1:01:47.838
- I came forward
for you today, Eli.

1:01:47.872 --> 1:01:48.873
I did that for you.

1:01:48.906 --> 1:01:50.474
- You should've asked me first.

1:01:50.507 --> 1:01:52.342
- You could go up there
and tell them you're sorry.

1:01:52.376 --> 1:01:53.143
It would be fine.

1:01:53.177 --> 1:01:55.012
- That's a stupid idea.

1:01:55.045 --> 1:01:56.680
- Don't fucking say that.

1:01:56.713 --> 1:01:57.481
- Stupid.

1:01:57.514 --> 1:01:58.715
- Don't!

1:01:58.749 --> 1:01:59.516
Fuck you!

1:02:02.052 --> 1:02:04.054
(grunts)

1:02:09.726 --> 1:02:10.928
Get the fuck off me.

1:02:10.961 --> 1:02:12.696
(grunting)

1:02:12.729 --> 1:02:13.730
Fuck you.

1:02:35.685 --> 1:02:38.188
- If you really cared about
me you'd leave me right now.

1:02:38.222 --> 1:02:39.756
You'd leave town.

1:02:40.690 --> 1:02:41.725
- [Daniel] Just come with me.

1:02:41.758 --> 1:02:42.860
- No!

1:02:42.893 --> 1:02:44.528
No, I'm not!

1:02:44.561 --> 1:02:46.997
- Then, I can't leave.

1:02:47.031 --> 1:02:49.566
- If they find you here,
they'll all be coming.

1:02:49.599 --> 1:02:51.401
- I don't give a fuck!

1:02:53.570 --> 1:02:56.440
- Pack your fucking
shit and leave.

1:02:58.809 --> 1:02:59.776
- Fuck.

1:02:59.810 --> 1:03:00.610
Eli!

1:03:02.847 --> 1:03:04.548
Eli, no!

1:03:04.581 --> 1:03:05.782
Wait!

1:03:05.816 --> 1:03:07.885
I'm not leaving, Eli!

1:03:07.918 --> 1:03:10.220
You can run to your
god all you want!

1:03:10.254 --> 1:03:14.458
I will be right there and
you will still be a faggot!

1:03:35.679 --> 1:03:36.713
- [Trevor] I mean,
how can you not know

1:03:36.746 --> 1:03:38.748
where your husband is?

1:03:40.750 --> 1:03:41.718
- Trevor.

1:03:41.751 --> 1:03:43.320
- Preacher.

1:03:43.353 --> 1:03:45.189
I just came by to
congratulate ya.

1:03:45.222 --> 1:03:46.023
- Congratulate me?

1:03:46.056 --> 1:03:46.823
- Yeah.

1:03:46.857 --> 1:03:47.824
Today.

1:03:47.858 --> 1:03:48.926
What you did.

1:03:48.959 --> 1:03:50.227
It's exactly what
this church needed.

1:03:50.260 --> 1:03:52.963
You just saved First Baptist.

1:03:52.997 --> 1:03:54.664
Nobody could leave
after the service.

1:03:54.698 --> 1:03:56.433
Everybody knew they'd
seen something amazing.

1:03:56.466 --> 1:03:58.835
Something that they'd tell
their children about some day.

1:03:58.869 --> 1:04:00.637
You know, the birth of a healer.

1:04:00.670 --> 1:04:01.838
Phones have been
ringing off the hooks.

1:04:01.872 --> 1:04:04.174
The tickets for
our annual revival?

1:04:04.208 --> 1:04:06.076
They're already sold out.

1:04:06.110 --> 1:04:08.012
There ain't no doubt
we're on the board now.

1:04:08.045 --> 1:04:09.880
It's just a matter of how
much they're gonna give us,

1:04:09.914 --> 1:04:12.782
and I gotta say, I think it's
gonna be a heck of a lot.

1:04:12.816 --> 1:04:14.151
- Tickets?

1:04:14.184 --> 1:04:16.653
Y'all are selling
tickets to church?

1:04:16.686 --> 1:04:17.988
- I mean, it's just $6 a piece.

1:04:18.022 --> 1:04:19.256
More like a placeholder.

1:04:19.289 --> 1:04:20.190
Nobody wants to
get all dressed up

1:04:20.224 --> 1:04:21.892
and not have a place to sit.

1:04:21.926 --> 1:04:23.160
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

1:04:23.193 --> 1:04:24.661
$6 is a lot of money
to some people.

1:04:24.694 --> 1:04:26.964
I don't think y'all
should be charging at all.

1:04:26.997 --> 1:04:28.298
What about the potluck after?

1:04:28.332 --> 1:04:29.833
Do people have to
pay for that, too?

1:04:29.866 --> 1:04:30.901
- June, darling.

1:04:30.935 --> 1:04:32.469
Mega churches do
not have potlucks.

1:04:32.502 --> 1:04:34.905
Mega churches have banquets.

1:04:37.874 --> 1:04:40.577
All right, I'll let y'all go.

1:04:40.610 --> 1:04:41.878
I gotta go to the driving range

1:04:41.912 --> 1:04:43.113
and kind of work off
some of this energy.

1:04:43.147 --> 1:04:44.448
Man.

1:04:44.481 --> 1:04:45.983
Okay, you just get
back to studying.

1:04:46.016 --> 1:04:46.883
Do your thing.

1:04:46.917 --> 1:04:48.252
Whatever you need to do to prep.

1:04:48.285 --> 1:04:50.887
But, you be ready come Sunday.

1:04:59.463 --> 1:05:00.931
- I need a drink.

1:05:02.299 --> 1:05:04.234
- Yeah, since that's what you
should be doing right now.

1:05:04.268 --> 1:05:05.802
Drinking when your
church needs you?

1:05:05.835 --> 1:05:08.205
- I know you're holding.

1:05:08.238 --> 1:05:11.942
I know that you have whiskey
in that old Cheerio box

1:05:11.976 --> 1:05:13.277
in the cabinet.

1:05:19.316 --> 1:05:22.319
You should go stay
with your cousin.

1:05:27.891 --> 1:05:31.895
I don't want you to be here
when the picture comes out.

1:05:42.973 --> 1:05:44.874
- I took the picture.

1:05:51.081 --> 1:05:51.881
- You did?

1:05:53.117 --> 1:05:55.319
- I knew you were cheating

1:05:57.954 --> 1:05:59.756
'cause you were happy.

1:06:11.168 --> 1:06:15.372
I mean, you know I've never
been treated good, Eli.

1:06:17.007 --> 1:06:21.245
But, even when you're unhappy,
or you're not talking,

1:06:22.112 --> 1:06:24.381
you still treat me decent.

1:06:24.414 --> 1:06:25.815
And you're kind.

1:06:27.417 --> 1:06:31.221
You understand me and
you love me in some way.

1:06:34.824 --> 1:06:38.962
If you didn't have this
disease you'd be perfect.

1:06:41.765 --> 1:06:43.233
Maybe if you didn't
have this disease

1:06:43.267 --> 1:06:45.602
you'd be with someone else.

1:06:49.173 --> 1:06:51.275
Is that why you chose me?

1:06:55.345 --> 1:06:58.348
'Cause you knew I
wouldn't leave you

1:06:59.749 --> 1:07:01.351
even if I found out?

1:07:46.463 --> 1:07:49.065
Did you ask that man to leave?

1:07:55.805 --> 1:07:58.108
- I couldn't get him to go.

1:08:07.684 --> 1:08:09.286
Where are you going?

1:08:12.256 --> 1:08:15.058
- I'm gonna go
clean up your mess.

1:08:18.895 --> 1:08:22.266
(slow violin music)

1:08:22.299 --> 1:08:23.700
- [Eli] Consider it
pure joy, my brothers,

1:08:23.733 --> 1:08:27.137
whenever you face
trials of any kind.

1:08:27.171 --> 1:08:30.840
You know, the testing of your
faith develops perseverance.

1:08:30.874 --> 1:08:32.642
Perseverance must
finish its works.

1:08:32.676 --> 1:08:36.880
You may be mature and
complete, not lacking anything.

1:08:38.648 --> 1:08:42.118
If any of you lacks
wisdom, you should ask God

1:08:42.152 --> 1:08:44.621
who gives generously to
all without finding fault

1:08:44.654 --> 1:08:47.123
and it will be given to Him.

1:08:47.157 --> 1:08:50.694
But if you ask, you must
believe and not doubt.

1:08:50.727 --> 1:08:54.164
For he who doubts is
like a wave in the sea.

1:08:54.198 --> 1:08:56.500
Blown and tossed by the wind.

1:09:05.775 --> 1:09:08.712
(knocking on door)

1:09:27.030 --> 1:09:29.566
- I'm June, Brother Eli's wife.

1:09:29.599 --> 1:09:31.735
- [Daniel] He ain't here.

1:10:02.532 --> 1:10:04.133
- You making meth?

1:10:08.272 --> 1:10:10.974
I grew up in the trailer parks.

1:10:12.376 --> 1:10:14.944
- My mama and I used to make it.

1:10:14.978 --> 1:10:15.979
- Your mama?

1:10:16.780 --> 1:10:17.581
She used?

1:10:20.016 --> 1:10:21.217
She still using?

1:10:24.087 --> 1:10:25.188
Well, that's good.

1:10:25.221 --> 1:10:26.956
- She's dead.

1:10:26.990 --> 1:10:27.791
- Oh.

1:10:33.162 --> 1:10:34.631
- What do you want?

1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:39.403
- I come to ask
you to leave town.

1:10:41.271 --> 1:10:43.239
- I ain't bothering nobody.

1:10:43.273 --> 1:10:45.241
- Look, you come into my town,
you messed with my husband,

1:10:45.275 --> 1:10:47.844
you threatened my
church, and for what?

1:10:47.877 --> 1:10:48.645
For what?

1:10:48.678 --> 1:10:50.580
- He came after me.

1:10:50.614 --> 1:10:53.149
I was just sitting there
eating and he came after me.

1:10:53.182 --> 1:10:55.184
- Eli loves me, not you.

1:10:57.721 --> 1:10:59.489
He used you and I'm sorry.

1:10:59.523 --> 1:11:01.791
- You really think he loves you?

1:11:01.825 --> 1:11:05.929
There ain't no doubt that
he'd rather be here with me

1:11:06.630 --> 1:11:08.398
than back home with you.

1:11:12.068 --> 1:11:13.970
- He's not here with you now.

1:11:14.003 --> 1:11:16.205
- And he ain't home for you.

1:11:19.008 --> 1:11:20.810
He's home for his god.

1:11:22.312 --> 1:11:24.314
That's who he cares about.

1:11:25.915 --> 1:11:27.517
Himself and his god.

1:11:32.322 --> 1:11:36.326
You're just another thing
he picked up along the way.

1:11:43.767 --> 1:11:47.971
- You know, when I was a little
girl, I found this snow owl.

1:11:49.739 --> 1:11:53.943
You know, the kind of bird
you usually only see up north?

1:11:54.844 --> 1:11:56.112
It was a gorgeous creature.

1:11:56.145 --> 1:11:59.349
It's all white,
and soft feathers,

1:11:59.383 --> 1:12:01.385
and these deep black eyes.

1:12:03.319 --> 1:12:04.721
And it was sick.

1:12:06.556 --> 1:12:10.159
It was just lying there
in a pile of snow.

1:12:11.361 --> 1:12:14.398
And I picked it up,
and took it home,

1:12:16.299 --> 1:12:19.235
and I put it in a baby pen.

1:12:19.268 --> 1:12:23.272
And I fed it, fed it dirt,
and worms, and grass.

1:12:24.273 --> 1:12:25.375
And it lived.

1:12:26.376 --> 1:12:29.278
And every day I'd
take it outside

1:12:29.312 --> 1:12:32.181
and I'd try to
get it to fly away

1:12:33.517 --> 1:12:36.386
because I knew it was different,

1:12:36.420 --> 1:12:40.223
and it didn't belong,
and I wanted it to go.

1:12:43.326 --> 1:12:45.729
Someplace where it could live.

1:12:48.532 --> 1:12:51.735
And one day I woke
up and it was dead.

1:12:55.304 --> 1:12:59.509
See, I did everything
I could for that owl,

1:13:00.376 --> 1:13:02.446
but I couldn't make it fly away.

1:13:05.449 --> 1:13:09.653
Now, you get out of this
town and don't look back.

1:13:12.321 --> 1:13:14.323
You weren't made for it.

1:13:20.997 --> 1:13:22.398
- I ain't leaving.

1:13:36.446 --> 1:13:37.981
- I know your kind.

1:13:45.455 --> 1:13:47.356
Make him leave, Trevor.

1:14:05.374 --> 1:14:07.477
(grunting)

1:14:12.649 --> 1:14:15.485
- Begone, devil, in the
Lord Jesus Christ's name.

1:14:15.519 --> 1:14:16.720
Begone, Satan.

1:14:17.854 --> 1:14:20.857
I fill that void
with the Holy Spirit.

1:14:22.225 --> 1:14:26.429
(speaking in tongues)

1:14:27.263 --> 1:14:28.565
God, I need you to show me.

1:14:28.598 --> 1:14:31.034
I need you to show me.

1:14:31.067 --> 1:14:32.869
I need you to show me.

1:14:34.470 --> 1:14:36.239
I need you to show me, God.

1:14:36.272 --> 1:14:38.374
(punches thudding)

1:14:38.407 --> 1:14:40.710
(grunting)

1:14:53.422 --> 1:14:54.924
- God, my favorite.

1:14:56.292 --> 1:14:57.727
One of my favorites.

1:14:57.761 --> 1:14:58.762
Romans 6:23.

1:15:02.165 --> 1:15:04.534
"For the wages of sin is death,

1:15:04.568 --> 1:15:06.469
but the gift of
God is eternal life

1:15:06.502 --> 1:15:09.739
through our Lord Jesus Christ."

1:15:09.773 --> 1:15:10.574
Amen.

1:15:12.776 --> 1:15:14.911
(grunts)

1:15:46.610 --> 1:15:48.344
Greyhound doesn't get
here until the morning.

1:15:48.377 --> 1:15:50.513
I'm gonna put him on it myself.

1:15:50.546 --> 1:15:51.447
All right?

1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:52.916
He ain't going nowhere tonight.

1:15:52.949 --> 1:15:54.483
But, you watch him.

1:15:54.517 --> 1:15:55.785
Hey, watch him.

1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:19.475
(uptempo violin music)

1:16:19.508 --> 1:16:21.878
- I'm all alone here, God.

1:16:21.911 --> 1:16:23.112
I'm all alone.

1:16:25.214 --> 1:16:26.115
I just need ya.

1:16:26.149 --> 1:16:26.983
I don't feel ya.

1:16:27.016 --> 1:16:29.018
I don't feel you at all.

1:16:30.119 --> 1:16:31.354
I'll do whatever you want,

1:16:31.387 --> 1:16:32.956
I just need you to
talk to me, God.

1:16:32.989 --> 1:16:34.824
He won't leave.

1:16:34.858 --> 1:16:36.192
He won't leave.

1:16:37.661 --> 1:16:38.494
He won't leave, God.

1:16:38.527 --> 1:16:39.729
What am I gonna do?

1:16:39.763 --> 1:16:41.297
Just talk to me,
just talk to me!

1:16:41.330 --> 1:16:44.133
(tires squealing)

1:16:45.635 --> 1:16:47.904
- [Aaron On Radio] These
filthy, disgusting sickos.

1:16:47.937 --> 1:16:50.006
Our life would be a lot
easier for your church

1:16:50.039 --> 1:16:51.808
if you just let the homos be.

1:16:51.841 --> 1:16:53.643
I look 'em right in the eye.

1:16:53.677 --> 1:16:55.945
I'm not looking for
an easy life, brother.

1:16:55.979 --> 1:16:59.248
I'm looking for a
righteous one, praise God.

1:16:59.282 --> 1:17:02.786
He has made it plain and
clear that homosexuality

1:17:02.819 --> 1:17:04.453
is an abomination.

1:17:04.487 --> 1:17:06.422
If you don't agree then...

1:17:06.455 --> 1:17:07.590
You heard it, true believers.

1:17:07.623 --> 1:17:09.525
Going straight to Hell.

1:17:09.558 --> 1:17:12.762
(tires squealing)

1:17:12.796 --> 1:17:15.765
You say, Pastor, that's so
extensive and so narrow-minded.

1:17:15.799 --> 1:17:17.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:17:17.033 --> 1:17:18.802
when it comes to the
gospel of Jesus Christ,

1:17:18.835 --> 1:17:21.370
I'm so narrow-minded
a gnat could land

1:17:21.404 --> 1:17:23.673
on the bridge of my nose
and kick both eyeballs out

1:17:23.707 --> 1:17:24.841
at the same time.

1:17:24.874 --> 1:17:26.943
We are at war,
brothers and sisters.

1:17:26.976 --> 1:17:29.045
We're going to war
with the Devil.

1:17:29.078 --> 1:17:30.579
Unbelievers will try
to make you think

1:17:30.613 --> 1:17:33.482
that homosexuality is
normal, but it's not.

1:17:33.516 --> 1:17:34.751
And how do I know?

1:17:34.784 --> 1:17:37.586
I know because the
Bible tells me so.

1:17:37.620 --> 1:17:41.390
Because the Bible is the
inspired Word of God.

1:17:41.424 --> 1:17:43.592
You might say, Preacher, that's
a pretty narrow-minded way

1:17:43.626 --> 1:17:45.294
of looking at things,
and I'll tell you what.

1:17:45.328 --> 1:17:47.296
It is, praise God.

1:17:47.330 --> 1:17:50.066
And I'm as narrow
as the Word of God.

1:17:50.099 --> 1:17:52.501
Everyone applauds when the
folks come out of the closet

1:17:52.535 --> 1:17:54.503
like it's a badge of honor.

1:17:54.537 --> 1:17:58.474
Church, it's time we
come out of the closet.

1:17:58.507 --> 1:18:01.677
Brothers and sisters, come
out of the closet for Christ.

1:18:01.711 --> 1:18:05.014
Stand beside me and say,
World, enough is enough.

1:18:05.048 --> 1:18:06.515
I will walk with God.

1:18:06.549 --> 1:18:10.053
I will choose salvation
till the day I die.

1:18:39.849 --> 1:18:40.850
Leave.

1:18:46.422 --> 1:18:47.423
Now.

1:19:33.469 --> 1:19:35.571
[church music]

1:19:48.451 --> 1:19:50.486
[louder church music]

1:20:57.553 --> 1:20:58.554
[church music ends]

1:21:13.669 --> 1:21:17.340
* I've got a river of
life flowing out of me *

1:21:17.373 --> 1:21:21.110
* Spring up, O
well, within my soul *

1:21:21.144 --> 1:21:24.948
* Spring up, O well,
and make me whole *

1:21:24.981 --> 1:21:29.152
* Spring up, O
well, and give to me *

1:21:29.185 --> 1:21:32.989
* That life abundantly

1:21:33.022 --> 1:21:37.193
* Spring up, O
well, and give to me *

1:21:37.226 --> 1:21:41.330
* That life abundantly

1:21:41.364 --> 1:21:44.167
(people cheering)

1:22:17.866 --> 1:22:20.869
(slow rock music)
