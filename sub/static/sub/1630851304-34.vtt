WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:06.137
Julie: XAVIER IS THE HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD AND HE HOLDS THE

00:06.172 --> 00:07.517
GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

00:07.551 --> 00:11.724
BUT THE ONE POWER HE DOES NOT
HOLD IS THE SOLE POWER TO EVICT.

00:11.758 --> 00:16.896
AND THAT WILL BE DETERMINED
TONIGHT LIVE RIGHT HERE ON "BIG

00:16.931 --> 00:18.103
BROTHER."

00:18.137 --> 00:21.931
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
"BIG BROTHER": THE MEN OF THE

00:21.965 --> 00:24.517
COOKOUT AGREED TO GO TO THE END
TOGETHER.

00:24.551 --> 00:27.448
ONE THING I'M NOT REALLY
TRYING TO DO IS HAVE EITHER OF

00:27.482 --> 00:28.379
YOUR NAMES IN MY MOUTH.

00:28.413 --> 00:29.620
I AGREE WITH THAT.

00:29.655 --> 00:32.965
Announcer: BUT THERE WERE
MULTIPLE FINAL TWO DEALS AMONGST

00:33.000 --> 00:33.689
THE TRIO.

00:33.724 --> 00:36.034
YOU AND ME HAVE A FINAL TWO.

00:36.068 --> 00:41.034
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT A
FINAL TWO DEAL.

00:41.068 --> 00:44.689
I'M SAYING WE CAN MAKE THE DEAL
AND THEN WE CAN REVISIT IT.

00:44.724 --> 00:47.000
AND BE LIKE, HEY, TIME TO CHECK
IN.

00:47.034 --> 00:47.620
HOW ARE YOU?

00:47.655 --> 00:48.931
YEAH, I LIKE THAT.

00:48.965 --> 00:52.724
WE EQUALLY NEED EACH OTHER TO
MAKE IT TO THE FINAL TWO CHAIRS.

00:52.758 --> 00:55.965
I WANT TO AND I THINK YOU
WANT TO.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.793
Announcer: AFTER THE FIRST
TWO COOKOUT MEMBERS WERE SENT

00:58.827 --> 01:03.103
PACKING, THE GUYS AND AZAH WERE
ALL THAT REMAINED.

01:03.137 --> 01:04.827
FINAL FOUR.

01:04.862 --> 01:06.103
CONGRATULATIONS, EVERYONE.

01:06.137 --> 01:08.758
Announcer: AND BIG "D" LET
HIS BESTIE KNOW ABOUT HIS OTHER

01:08.793 --> 01:09.655
DEALS.

01:09.689 --> 01:12.482
WE HAVE HAD A FINAL TWO FOR
WEEK ONE.

01:12.517 --> 01:16.034
WEEK TWO, WHEN KY WAS H.O.H., I
MADE A DEAL.

01:16.068 --> 01:21.517
I'VE KNOWN PRETTY MUCH ABOUT
ALL OF BIG "D'S" PLANS UP UNTIL

01:21.551 --> 01:22.310
THIS MOMENT.

01:22.344 --> 01:24.586
I'M HONESTLY AT A LOSS FOR
WORDS.

01:24.620 --> 01:25.379
Announcer: WITH XAVIER
PUNCHING HIS TICKET TO THE FINAL

01:25.413 --> 01:26.655
THREE...

01:26.689 --> 01:29.517
CONGRATULATIONS, XAVIER, YOU
ARE THE NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

01:29.551 --> 01:31.448
Announcer: ...HE MADE HIS
NOMINATIONS...

01:31.482 --> 01:34.724
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, AZAH,
AND YOU, KYLAND.

01:34.758 --> 01:38.896
Announcer: ...KNOWING THAT
THE REAL POWER WAS WITH THE

01:38.931 --> 01:39.689
VETO.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.137
THESE NOMINATIONS ARE
DIFFERENT.

01:41.172 --> 01:42.965
THE VETO HOLDER THIS WEEK
DETERMINES WHO GETS TO THE FINAL

01:43.000 --> 01:44.724
THREE AND WHO GOES HOME.

01:44.758 --> 01:47.206
Announcer: "X" TRIED TO GET
DEROAK BOARD.

01:47.241 --> 01:51.068
I THINK WE BOTH COULD BEAT
AZAH.

01:51.103 --> 01:53.206
I'M TRYING TO PERSUADE BIG "D"
AND GET HIM MORE COMFORTABLE

01:53.241 --> 01:55.862
WITH THE IDEA OF POTENTIALLY
VOTING COUNTY LAND OUT.

01:55.896 --> 01:58.724
Announcer: BUT BIG "D" WAS
ON THE FENCE ABOUT WHO NEEDED TO

01:58.758 --> 01:59.724
GO.

01:59.758 --> 02:01.344
THAT GIRL SAT IN HER ROOM THE
WHOLE SEASON.

02:01.379 --> 02:02.620
AND MADE IT TO THE FINAL TWO.

02:02.655 --> 02:06.310
EVEN THOUGH KYLAND HAS BEEN
SHADY AS HELL LATELY, I DO WANT

02:06.344 --> 02:07.758
TO HONOR OUR FINAL THREE DEAL.

02:07.793 --> 02:12.482
Announcer: AT THE FINAL
POWER OF VETO COMPETITION OF THE

02:12.517 --> 02:15.482
SUMMER, XAVIER ONCE AGAIN
DOMINATED.

02:15.517 --> 02:18.034
WINNING THIS MEANS I AM IN
FULL CONTROL TO TRY TO PUT

02:18.068 --> 02:23.758
MYSELF IN THE BEST POSITION TO
WIN $750,000.

02:23.793 --> 02:29.206
BETTER BUCKLE UP, AMERICA.

02:29.241 --> 02:32.586
Announcer: FEELING NERVOUS,
KY TRIED TO GET ASSURANCES FROM

02:32.620 --> 02:33.862
"X."

02:33.896 --> 02:37.344
IT'S JUST VULNERABLE MOMENTS
AND I THINK REASSURANCES HELP

02:37.379 --> 02:42.931
AND TO NOT GET THEM INSTANTLY
HAS MY WORRY AMPLIIFYING.

02:42.965 --> 02:47.000
Announcer: BUT THE LAWYER
WAS INTENT ON SENDING KYLAND TO

02:47.034 --> 02:48.206
JURY.

02:48.241 --> 02:51.931
NOW THEY WON THE POWER OF
VETO, GETTING BIG "D" TO VOTE

02:51.965 --> 02:54.034
OUT KYLAND WOULD BE EPIC.

02:54.068 --> 02:55.689
WILL BIG "D" FOLLOW THROUGH WITH
THE PLAN?

02:55.724 --> 02:56.931
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

02:56.965 --> 03:00.620
Announcer: TONIGHT, WILL
XAVIER KEEP NOMINATIONS THE SAME

03:00.655 --> 03:04.620
FORCING BIG "D" TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN AZAH AND KYLAND?

03:04.655 --> 03:08.620
WHO WILL BE EVICTED AND WHO WILL
MAKE IT TO THE FINAL THREE.

03:08.655 --> 03:09.586
PLUS...

03:09.620 --> 03:10.689
WHAT'S UP!

03:10.724 --> 03:14.310
Announcer: TIFFANY AND
HANNAH HIT THE JURY HOUSE.

03:14.344 --> 03:21.689
Announcer: ALL THIS RIGHT
NOW LIVE ON "BIG BROTHER"!

03:21.724 --> 03:28.586
ARE YOU DONE?

03:28.620 --> 03:32.827
Julie: GOOD EVENING, I'M
JULIE CHEN MOONVES.

03:32.862 --> 03:36.172
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER."

03:36.206 --> 03:39.586
IT'S DAY 79 INSIDE THE "BIG
BROTHER" HOUSE, AND BY THE END

03:39.620 --> 03:44.000
OF THE HOUR, WE WILL KNOW THE
FINAL THREE WHO WILL MAKE IT TO

03:44.034 --> 03:49.241
FINALE NIGHT FOR THE CHANCE TO
WIN "BIG BROTHER" AND THE

03:49.275 --> 03:52.758
$750,000 GRAND PRIZE THAT GOES
WITH IT.

03:52.793 --> 03:55.241
SO WILL THE VETO BE USED?

03:55.275 --> 03:59.379
AND WILL KYLAND FALL VICTIM TO
THE BIGGEST BLINDSIDE OF THE

03:59.413 --> 04:00.034
SUMMER?

04:00.068 --> 04:03.448
IT ALL UNFOLDS LIVE TONIGHT.

04:03.482 --> 04:12.689
BUT FIRST, BIG "D" HAS A BIG
DILEMMA.

04:12.724 --> 04:13.793
I'M STRESSED.

04:13.827 --> 04:15.896
> WHY ARE YOU STRESSED?

04:15.931 --> 04:18.034
I MEAN, I GET WHERE YOU'RE
COMING FROM.

04:18.068 --> 04:22.241
I KNOW YOUR STRESS IS DIFFERENT
THAN MINE, BUT WE'RE ALL

04:22.275 --> 04:23.379
STRESSED.

04:23.413 --> 04:24.620
WITH XAVIER HAVING ALL THE POWER
THIS WEEK, THERE IS A

04:24.655 --> 04:28.034
POSSIBILITY THAT HE CAN USE THAT
POWER OF VETO OR NOT, WHICH

04:28.068 --> 04:32.241
MEANS I COULD END UP ON THE
BLOCK OR I COULD END UP CASTING

04:32.275 --> 04:35.379
THAT SOLO VOTE TO EVICT ONE OF
THE HOUSEGUESTS.

04:35.413 --> 04:36.896
AND THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE.

04:36.931 --> 04:41.068
IT'S A VERY AWKWARD TIME, AND
ALL EMOTIONS ARE HIGH RIGHT NOW.

04:41.103 --> 04:45.586
I THINK YOU HAVE NOTHING TO
WORRY ABOUT, UNLESS HE DECIDES

04:45.620 --> 04:47.758
TO USE THE VETO ON AZAH.

04:47.793 --> 04:50.413
I DON'T THINK HE'LL DO THAT.

04:50.448 --> 04:53.068
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE HIS
MIND IS AT.

04:53.103 --> 04:56.448
HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITIES
TO MAKE DIFFERENT DECISIONS, I

04:56.482 --> 04:58.413
DID MAKE THOSE DIFFERENT
DECISIONS.

04:58.448 --> 05:04.137
YOU OR "X" CAN'T SAY, "I WONDER
IF HE WOO OF DONE THAT TO ME

05:04.172 --> 05:06.206
LAST WEEK?"
I DID AND I DIDN'T.

05:06.241 --> 05:07.793
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT THE SAME
REVERSED.

05:07.827 --> 05:08.379
IT'S HARD.

05:08.413 --> 05:09.517
NO, I GET THAT.

05:09.551 --> 05:10.379
IT IS HARD.

05:10.413 --> 05:11.827
YOU'RE THE MOST VULNERABLE.

05:11.862 --> 05:13.068
GOT THAT.

05:13.103 --> 05:16.000
I'M GIVING YOU THE SAME ADVICE
THAT I GAVE AZAH, WHICH IS WE

05:16.034 --> 05:17.758
DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO
PLAY OUT.

05:17.793 --> 05:22.620
YOU KNOW, SHE EXPECTS ME TO BE
HER RIDE OR DIE.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.206
I'VE BEEN WITH HER SINCE--
LONGER EVEN BEFORE YOU.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.482
YEAH.

05:26.517 --> 05:31.034
AND I'M OVER HERE LIKE, GIRL,
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY I MIGHT

05:31.068 --> 05:33.965
HAVE TO SEND YOU-- LIKE, SEND
YOU HOME.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.689
FOR ME, IT'S LIKE SHE'S DONE
LESS.

05:37.724 --> 05:39.620
WE'RE NOT THE SAME.

05:39.655 --> 05:43.448
DEREK TELING ME ABOUT HOW
DIFFICULT IT IS FOR HIM TO

05:43.482 --> 05:47.517
POTENTIALLY HAVE TO SEND AZAH
HOME, LIKE, YO, WELCOME TO THE

05:47.551 --> 05:48.793
CLUB.

05:48.827 --> 05:51.655
THIS IS WHAT THE COOKOUT'S BEEN
DOING ALL SUMMER LONG, ALL OF

05:51.689 --> 05:52.827
US, EXCEPT FOR YOU.

05:52.862 --> 05:53.448
I GET IT.

05:53.482 --> 05:54.862
IT'S JUR FIRST TIME.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.689
BUT, LIKE, THIS IS WHAT WE'VE
GOT TO DO.

05:57.724 --> 06:01.758
AND, YOU KNOW, I'D APPRECIATE
THE-- THE FOLLOW-THROUGH.

06:01.793 --> 06:05.000
I'LL TRY MY BEST TO BE THERE
FOR YOU.

06:05.034 --> 06:06.931
I'M TRYING TO BE THERE FOR
MYSELF.

06:06.965 --> 06:08.655
I'M TRYING TO BE THERE FOR HER.

06:08.689 --> 06:12.827
EMOTIONALLY RIGHT NOW, YOU
CAN BE THERE 100% FOR AZAH, AS

06:12.862 --> 06:14.689
LONG AS DECISION-WISE, YOU'RE
THERE FOR ME.

06:14.724 --> 06:16.310
I'M IN A TOUGH POSITION.

06:16.344 --> 06:19.827
YOU KNOW, I HAVE MY BEST FRIEND,
AZAH, WHO I HAVE BEEN ON THE

06:19.862 --> 06:22.275
SAME TEAM WITH AND WORKING WITH
SINCE THE BEGINNING.

06:22.310 --> 06:26.896
AND THEN I HAVE MY SHOWMANCE
FRIEND KYLAND.

06:26.931 --> 06:29.137
SO I DON'T KNOW WHICH DEAL I'M
GOING TO BREAK.

06:29.172 --> 06:34.241
LIKE I SAID, DECISION-WISE, I'M
STILL-- YOU KNOW, I'M STICKING

06:34.275 --> 06:35.137
TO WHAT I SAID.

06:35.172 --> 06:36.103
THANK YOU.

06:36.137 --> 06:43.931
I'M STILL WHERE I SAID I WAS
GOING TO BE.

06:43.965 --> 06:47.103
YOU DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE
AN EVICTION TOMORROW, DO YOU?

06:47.137 --> 06:49.551
PLEASE, STOP.

06:49.586 --> 06:50.310
PLEASE.

06:50.344 --> 06:51.000
I'M BEGGING YOU.

06:51.034 --> 06:52.310
DON'T STRESS ME OUT LIKE THIS.

06:52.344 --> 06:56.655
IF "X" LEAVES NOMINATIONS THE
SAME, IF I'M THE VOTE, I DON'T

06:56.689 --> 06:59.103
KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

06:59.137 --> 07:02.862
IT'S JUST HARD BECAUSE WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT MY BEST FRIEND IN

07:02.896 --> 07:05.758
THIS GAME, WHO I LOVE SO MUCH,
AND THEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

07:05.793 --> 07:11.379
PERSON THAT I'VE LITERALLY BEEN
DEALING WITH.

07:11.413 --> 07:16.448
IT'S JUST THAT HE LOOKS AT ME,
LITERALLY, LIKE "I TRUST YOU SO

07:16.482 --> 07:19.000
MUCH WITH EVERYTHING."

07:19.034 --> 07:21.758
KYLAND IS A GAMER.

07:21.793 --> 07:25.586
EVER SINCE BIG "D" TOLD ME HE
HAS DEALS WITH BOTH XAVIER AND

07:25.620 --> 07:29.758
KYLAND, IT'S HAD ME'S LITTLE
NERVOUS ABOUT WHERE HIS VOTE IS

07:29.793 --> 07:31.275
GOING TO LIE THIS WEEK.

07:31.310 --> 07:33.103
WE'VE LITERALLY BEEN TOGETHER
SINCE DAY ONE.

07:33.137 --> 07:38.103
AND IT KIND OF MAKES ME FEEL
SOME KIND OF WAY THAT SHE IS

07:38.137 --> 07:39.413
STRUGGLING SO MUCH WITH THIS
DECISION.

07:39.448 --> 07:40.655
HERE'S MY THING.

07:40.689 --> 07:44.758
I KNOW IF HE WANTS TO DO THE
WHOLE BATMAN, SUPERMAN THING, IF

07:44.793 --> 07:47.275
HE WINS FINAL H.O.H., HE TAKES
ME.

07:47.310 --> 07:48.137
THAT BENEFITS ME.

07:48.172 --> 07:50.000
BUT I KNOW YOU AREN'T THERE IF
HE WINS.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.172
CORRECT.

07:51.206 --> 07:53.379
AND SHE MIGHT HAVE MORE
INCENTIVE TO TAKE YOU THAN ME.

07:53.413 --> 07:54.655
CORRECT.

07:54.689 --> 07:57.000
YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO BACK ON A DEAL, YOU KNOW,

07:57.034 --> 08:01.793
"X" CAN USE THE VETO ON ME, AND
I'LL MAKE THAT DECISION REAL

08:01.827 --> 08:03.000
EASY FOR YOU, HONEY.

08:03.034 --> 08:05.413
LIKE, I DON'T MIND.

08:05.448 --> 08:08.172
I AIN'T GOT NO DEAL WITH THAT...

08:08.206 --> 08:10.310
I AIN'T GOT NOTHING.

08:10.344 --> 08:13.103
ONE OF THESE KOSMS TO TRY TO
AVOID.

08:13.137 --> 08:17.965
NOW I JUST NEED TO GET THE... TO
TRIGGER.

08:18.000 --> 08:26.517
BIG "D" IS LETTING HIS EMOTIONS.

08:26.551 --> 08:29.758
HE NEEDS TO THINK MORE WITH HIS
GAME MIND THAN HIS HEART.

08:29.793 --> 08:33.068
I'M JUST TRYING TO LOOK AT
THIS JURY AND HOW THEY THINK.

08:33.103 --> 08:35.758
YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDE ON WHAT
YOU WANT.

08:35.793 --> 08:38.551
IF YOU WANT TO BE THE PERSON AT
THE END WHO SAYS, YOU KNOW, I

08:38.586 --> 08:41.724
KEPT THE DEALS THAT I WAS
SUPPOSED TO MAKE, THEN LET ME DO

08:41.758 --> 08:43.034
IT.

08:43.068 --> 08:47.103
THINK ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF "BIG
BROTHER" PLAYER YOU WANT TO BE.

08:47.137 --> 08:49.206
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THAT KIND OF
COMES DOWN TO.

08:49.241 --> 08:55.620
I THINK THE HARD PART IS THAT
THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME I'M

08:55.655 --> 09:00.551
ACTUALLY GOING BACK ON
SOMETHING, WHICH LOOKS BAD ON MY

09:00.586 --> 09:01.827
RESUME.

09:01.862 --> 09:05.655
HE COULD GO BACK AND SAY, "ME
AND "D" HAD AN AGREEMENT NOT TO

09:05.689 --> 09:06.965
VOTE EACH OTHER OUT."

09:07.000 --> 09:08.931
DON'T LET HIM GAME YOU.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.448
YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE
TOLD YOU THEY ARE TAKING YOU TO

09:12.482 --> 09:13.655
FINAL TWO.

09:13.689 --> 09:15.758
YOU ARE GUARANTEED FINAL TWO
EITHER WAY, AND THIS IS SUCH A

09:15.793 --> 09:17.034
HARD DECISION FOR YOU.

09:17.068 --> 09:20.724
I HAVE NO PROBLEM COMING OFF THE
BLOCK AND SENDING KYLAND OUT.

09:20.758 --> 09:27.068
I'VE BEEN WANT THING TO SEND HIM
OUT SINCE WEEK SIX, OKAY.

09:27.103 --> 09:27.482
BOOM!

09:27.517 --> 09:28.413
I DO, TOO.

09:28.448 --> 09:29.586
AND I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

09:29.620 --> 09:33.241
THIS WILL HAVE TO BE ANOTHER
BLINDSIDE "X" SITUATION.

09:33.275 --> 09:41.172
I KNOW.

09:41.448 --> 09:42.517
DO I LISTEN TO PEOPLE?

09:42.551 --> 09:44.172
YEAH, YOU DO.

09:44.206 --> 09:46.758
ANY TIME WE'VE HAD A DISCUSSION
ABOUT ANYTHING REGARDING THE

09:46.793 --> 09:50.241
COOKOUT, WE GO BACK AND FORTH,
AND USUALLY WE COME DOWN TO THE

09:50.275 --> 09:50.965
SAME CONCLUSION.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.172
BIG "D" DOESN'T AGREE.

09:52.206 --> 09:54.517
YOU GUYS PROBABLY HAVE
DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS THAN YOU

09:54.551 --> 09:54.931
AND I HAVE.

09:54.965 --> 09:55.758
THANK YOU.

09:55.793 --> 09:57.137
NO, I LISTEN.

09:57.172 --> 10:01.413
NO, AZAH, WE ARE DONE TALKING
FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON UNTIL

10:01.448 --> 10:04.344
WE WATCH THE SEASON BACK AND
THEN WE CAN DISCUSS.

10:04.379 --> 10:06.448
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS I
PLANNED BEHIND YOUR BACK THAT

10:06.482 --> 10:08.172
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT.

10:08.206 --> 10:11.034
ME AND AZAH HAVE HAD A FEW
CONVERSATIONS SINCE MAKING IT TO

10:11.068 --> 10:15.379
TOP FOUR, GOING OVER OUR STATS

SO, AZAH, KYLAND, FINALE NIGHT
IS LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY, BUT,

29:28.517 --> 29:30.241
UNFORTUNATELY, ONLY ONE OF YOU
WILL MAKE IT THERE.

29:30.275 --> 29:36.206
I'D LIKE TO GIVE EACH OF YOU ONE
FINAL CHANCE TO ADDRESS BIG "D"

29:36.241 --> 29:40.000
BEFORE HE CASTS THE SOLE VOTE TO
EVICT.

29:40.034 --> 29:43.758
SO, AZAH, YOU'RE FIRST.

29:43.793 --> 29:49.517
I FIRST WANT TO GIVE GOD ALL
THE GLORY, HONOR, AND PRAISE FOR

29:49.551 --> 29:51.793
PLUCKING A GIRL FROM MARYLAND
AND PUTTING HER HERE IN THE "BIG

29:51.827 --> 29:52.620
BROTHER" HOUSE.

29:52.655 --> 29:56.172
TO MY MOM, DAD, SISTERS, I LOVE
YOU.

29:56.206 --> 29:58.689
BIG "D," LOOK AT US.

29:58.724 --> 30:01.344
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?

30:01.379 --> 30:03.724
UNDERESTIMATE AND OVERLOOKED, A
PAIR OF JOKERS SOMEHOW MANAGED

30:03.758 --> 30:07.655
TO CRY, COOK, NAP, AND LAUGH
THEIR WAY TO FINAL FOUR.

30:07.689 --> 30:11.137
PEOPLE COME IN THIS HOUSE
LOOKING FOR MANY THINGS-- FAME,

30:11.172 --> 30:12.310
FORTUNE, AND MONEY.

30:12.344 --> 30:15.689
BUT ONE THING I'M SO HAPPY TO
HAVE FOUND IS A TRUE BEST

30:15.724 --> 30:16.482
FRIEND.

30:16.517 --> 30:17.724
WHATEVER YOUR DECISION, I LOVE
YOU.

30:17.758 --> 30:20.965
YOU KNOW ON THE EAST COAST WE'RE
GOING TO MAKE MEMORIES EVERY

30:21.000 --> 30:22.241
SINGLE WEEKEND.

30:22.275 --> 30:25.206
BUT IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY, I
WOULD LOVE TO SPEND THIS FINAL

30:25.241 --> 30:28.172
SIX DAYS BUILDING LIFETIME
MEMORIES WITH YOU.

30:28.206 --> 30:28.965
LOVE YOU, BROTHER.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.793
Julie: GIVING THE GLORY TO
GOD.

30:30.827 --> 30:31.241
VERY NICE.

30:31.275 --> 30:32.137
THANK YOU, AZAH.

30:32.172 --> 30:33.310
KYLAND, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.

30:33.344 --> 30:36.655
THANK YOU, JULIE.

30:36.689 --> 30:39.310
FIRST, I JUST WANT TO SEND LOVE
AND APPRECIATION TO ALL MY

30:39.344 --> 30:40.034
FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

30:40.068 --> 30:45.172
I COULD NOT BE HERE WITHOUT YOU.

30:45.206 --> 30:49.206
DEREK, I AM SO THANKFUL, FIRST
OFF, FOR ALL OF YOU, TO BE IN

30:49.241 --> 30:51.517
THIS GAME WITH YOU, TO PLAY IN
THIS GAME WITH YOU, AND FOR US

30:51.551 --> 30:54.896
TO DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS
SOMETHING THAT I WILL CHERISH

30:54.931 --> 30:57.379
FOREVER AND TRULY HAS MEANT A
LOT TO MY HEART.

30:57.413 --> 31:03.275
THAT BEING SAID, I WOULD LOVE TO
CONTINUE OUT THIS WEEK AND UP ON

31:03.310 --> 31:06.482
THE THE GAME AND MOVE ON TO
FINALE NIGHT WITH YOU ALL.

31:06.517 --> 31:09.448
SO THAT BEING SAID, DEREK, IT
WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO ME IF

31:09.482 --> 31:12.344
YOU COULD KEEP ME IN THIS GAME.

31:12.379 --> 31:13.551
Julie: THANK YOU, KYLAND.

31:13.586 --> 31:14.862
THANK YOU, BOTH.

31:14.896 --> 31:19.482
ALL RIGHT, BIG "D," IT IS NOW UP
TO YOU TO CAST THE SOLE VOTE TO

31:19.517 --> 31:20.068
EVICT.

31:20.103 --> 31:21.206
NOW, LISTEN UP, BIG "D."

31:21.241 --> 31:26.482
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER TO SEND
ONE NOMINEE TO JURY WHILE

31:26.517 --> 31:29.241
SENDING THE OTHER NOMINEE TO
FINALE NIGHT.

31:29.275 --> 31:33.172
JUST A REMINDER, WHEN BIG "D"
CASTS HIS VOTE, THE EVICTED

31:33.206 --> 31:36.620
HOUSEGUEST WILL HAVE JUST A FEW
MOMENTS TO SAY GOOD-BYE, GATHER

31:36.655 --> 31:41.965
HIS OR HER BELONGINGS, AND WALK
OUT THE FRONTDOOR.

31:42.000 --> 31:49.137
SO, BIG "D," PLEASE, FACE THE
TWO AND GO AHEAD AND CAST YOUR

31:49.172 --> 31:50.758
VOTE TO EVICT.

31:50.793 --> 31:56.000
LET ME FIRST SAY THAT ON A
PERSONAL LEVEL, I LOVE YOU,

31:56.034 --> 31:56.517
AZAH.

31:56.551 --> 31:58.068
I LOVE YOU, KYLAND.

31:58.103 --> 32:03.275
ON A GAME LEVEL, I HAVE MADE IT
CLEAR SINCE THE BEGINNING I OWE

32:03.310 --> 32:04.206
NOBODY ANYTHING.

32:04.241 --> 32:06.827
I PLAYED THIS GAME SOLELY FOR
MYSELF.

32:06.862 --> 32:12.931
SO AT THIS POINT, I CAST MY VOTE
TO EVICT KYLAND.

32:12.965 --> 32:13.689
OKAY.

32:13.724 --> 32:16.034
Julie: IT'S OFFICIAL,
KYLAND.

32:16.068 --> 32:25.344
KYLAND, YOU HAVE BEEN EVICTED
FROM THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

32:25.379 --> 32:25.827
ANY REASON?

32:25.862 --> 32:26.689
THE GAME.

32:26.724 --> 32:31.241
WHAT ABOUT THE GAME?

32:31.275 --> 32:32.172
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

32:32.206 --> 32:33.344
HUH?

32:33.379 --> 32:34.482
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

32:34.517 --> 32:39.965
OH, MAN, I MEAN, I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND... NOTICE.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.379
KYLAND, YOU KNOW AS A GAME
POINT OF VIEW, I CAN'T BEAT YOU.

32:43.413 --> 32:45.586
SO I'D RATHER GO AGAINST AZAH
THAN YOU.

32:45.620 --> 32:47.068
NO, I UNDERSTAND.

32:47.103 --> 32:48.241
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW.

32:48.275 --> 32:51.586
I'M WONDERING NO HEADS UP OR
ANYTHING FROM THIS GUY.

32:51.620 --> 33:00.206
I MEAN, I KEPT YOU IN THE LAST
WEEK.

33:00.241 --> 33:01.310
AND IS IT JUST...

33:01.344 --> 33:04.379
IT'S JUST HOW THE GAME GOES
KY.

33:04.413 --> 33:06.206
NO, I'M JUST ASKING.

33:06.241 --> 33:08.137
I THOUGHT--
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO GIVE

33:08.172 --> 33:13.482
YOU A HEADS UP, BUT I RESPECT
YOU TOO MUCH AS A PLAYER.

33:13.517 --> 33:17.241
GIVEN HE HAD THE SOLO VOTE TO
EVICT, GIVEN TIME,s I KNEW HE

33:17.275 --> 33:19.068
COULD MAKE IT GO THE OTHER WAIL.

33:19.103 --> 33:23.034
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE KOBE
THING, RAISING HIM TO BE A MAN

33:23.068 --> 33:23.862
AND FACE CHALLENGES.

33:23.896 --> 33:25.655
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MY
NEPHEW.

33:25.689 --> 33:26.896
I'M ASKING.

33:26.931 --> 33:28.586
NAMED AFTER KOBE.

33:28.620 --> 33:31.655
KOBE DISAPPOINT STEP DOWN FROM A
CHALLENGE.

33:31.689 --> 33:33.827
I SUGGEST STOP TALKING ABOUT
MY NEPHEW.

33:33.862 --> 33:38.862
I THINK THAT'S NOT REALLY UP
- TO ME, IF YOUR 97
- EE HAS NOBODY

33:38.896 --> 33:41.758
TO LOOK UP TO--
KEEP TALKING ABOUT MY NEPHEW.

33:41.793 --> 33:45.551
IF THERE'S NOBODY TO LOOK UP
TO, WHO IS GOING TO FIGURE OUT

33:45.586 --> 33:47.172
HOW TO RAISE HIM.

33:47.206 --> 33:50.896
KYLAND --
KYLAND, I NEED YOU TO LEAVE

33:50.931 --> 33:51.517
RIGHT NOW.

33:51.551 --> 33:52.413
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.

33:52.448 --> 33:54.275
HE DOESN'T HAVE A MAN.

33:54.310 --> 34:00.000
Julie: KYLAND, KYLAND,
KYLAND, I NEED YOU TO LEAVE

34:00.034 --> 34:01.000
RIGHT NOW.

34:01.034 --> 34:01.517
KYLAND.

34:01.551 --> 34:02.068
IS THIS ONE MINE?

34:02.103 --> 34:02.655
THANK YOU, KYLAND.

THANK YOU, HOUSEGUESTS.

34:03.586 --> 34:04.517
THANK YOU.

34:04.551 --> 34:07.310
Julie: WE HAVE TO SOCIALLY
DISTANCE.

34:07.344 --> 34:08.034
OF COURSE.

34:08.068 --> 34:09.344
Julie: I'M GIVING YOU AN

34:09.379 --> 34:10.655
AIR HUG FROM HERE.

34:10.689 --> 34:11.310
THANK YOU.

I MEAN--

34:15.310 --> 34:17.275
THANK YOU, GUYS.

34:17.310 --> 34:19.827
ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.

34:19.862 --> 34:24.413
YOU DESERVE IT.

34:24.448 --> 34:27.724
Julie: WHEN WE RETURN, I
WILL TALK LIVE WITH KYLAND.

34:27.758 --> 34:29.655
STAY WITH US.

34:41.620 --> 34:42.620
♪ ♪
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO "BIG

34:42.655 --> 34:43.862
BROTHER."

34:43.896 --> 34:45.551
I AM SITTING HERE WITH KYLAND,
WHO WAS JUST EVICTED FROM THE

34:45.586 --> 34:46.551
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

34:46.586 --> 34:50.793
IT WAS BIG "D" WHO CAST THE SOLE
VOTE TO EVICT.

34:50.827 --> 34:53.655
THE TWO OF YOU HAD A FINAL TWO
AGREEMENT.

34:53.689 --> 34:55.758
ARE YOU SHOCKED THAT HE EVICTED
YOU?

34:55.793 --> 34:59.482
UHM, AFTER THE FIRST WEEK, I
KIND OF MADE, LIKE, A VERY

34:59.517 --> 35:02.310
STRONG MENTAL COMMITMENT IN
TERMS OF NOT LETTING MYSELF BE

35:02.344 --> 35:04.965
SHOCKED BY ANYTHING BECAUSE I
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT, YOU

35:05.000 --> 35:08.413
KNOW, SEEING MYSELF ON THE BLOCK
THAT FIRST WEEK CAUGHT ME OFF

35:08.448 --> 35:09.551
GUARD.

35:09.586 --> 35:11.241
I WAS LIKE, I HAVE TO BE
PREPARED FOR THAT AT ANY TIME.

35:11.275 --> 35:15.068
SO I DEFINITELY IT WENT THROUGH
MY HEAD A FEW TIMES AS FAR AS

35:15.103 --> 35:16.758
YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:16.793 --> 35:19.758
I HAVE LOTS OF REASONS TO THINK
IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN BUT I ALWAYS

35:19.793 --> 35:20.931
ANYHOW IT COULD.

35:20.965 --> 35:23.206
Julie: WELL, LET ME ASK YOU
THIS, BEFORE THE VETO WAS

35:23.241 --> 35:27.551
PLAYED, BIG "D" WENT TO YOU FOR,
"ARE WE STILL GOOD, OUR FINAL

35:27.586 --> 35:29.620
TWO?"
AND IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE YOU WERE

35:29.655 --> 35:31.206
GIVING HIM ANY ASSURANCES.

35:31.241 --> 35:32.862
LIKE, "YEAH, YEAH, WE'RE GOOD."

35:32.896 --> 35:34.103
WHY DIDN'T YOU?

35:34.137 --> 35:38.689
MOSTLY FOR ME, IT KIND OF
CAME DOWN TO HOW I WANTED TO

35:38.724 --> 35:39.586
PLAY THE GAME.

35:39.620 --> 35:41.137
I MEAN, I THINK THAT --
WHICH IS HOW?

35:41.172 --> 35:44.310
WHICH IS MORE UP FRONT AND
KIND OF-- WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS

35:44.344 --> 35:46.172
"BIG BROTHER" AND YOU CAN DO ALL
THESE THINGS.

35:46.206 --> 35:49.034
BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S NOT
ALWAYS A NEED TO DO IT IF YOU

35:49.068 --> 35:50.137
DON'T HAVE TO.

35:50.172 --> 35:53.379
Julie: MEANING YOU WOULD
HAVE BEEN LYING TO HIM.

35:53.413 --> 35:56.931
YEAH I WOULD HAVE BEEN LYING
TO HIM IF I TOLD HIM UP FRONT.

35:56.965 --> 35:59.965
AT THAT TIME I MADE IT VERY
CLEAR TO EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.172
Julie: NOW THAT YOU'RE
SITTING HERE WITH ME, BE HONEST,

36:02.206 --> 36:03.517
YOU WISH YOU HAD LIED TO HIM.

36:03.551 --> 36:06.896
NO, I THINK I WISH I HAD
TALKED TO HIM A LITTLE BIT MORE

36:06.931 --> 36:09.827
THAN I DID AS FAR AS, LIKE, TALK
THROUGH THAT AFTER IT.

36:09.862 --> 36:13.275
BUT I THINK THAT AS FAR AS
LYING, LIKE I THINK THERE'S AN

36:13.310 --> 36:15.517
ELEMENT OF, LIKE, LYING WHEN YOU
TO.

36:15.551 --> 36:20.034
AND I THINK THAT FOR ME AND FROM
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU CAN

36:20.068 --> 36:23.275
TEND TO RESPECT PEOPLE WHO ONLY
DO IT WHEN THEY HAVE TO, AS

36:23.310 --> 36:27.034
OPPOSED TO DOING IT WHEN THEY
DON'T HAVE TO, WANTING TO BE A

36:27.068 --> 36:28.206
COMPETITOR.

36:28.241 --> 36:29.482
Julie: SO ARE YOU SAYING
THAT THE FINAL TWO AGREEMENT

36:29.517 --> 36:33.517
THAT YOU MADE WITH XAVIER, WHICH
THE TWO OF YOU NAMED, THE

36:33.551 --> 36:36.000
GENTLEMEN, THAT IS THE ONE YOU
HAD EVERY INTENTION OF HONORING.

36:36.034 --> 36:39.931
THAT WAS-- I THOUGHT WE WERE
BOTH ON BOARD WITH THE NAME, IN

36:39.965 --> 36:45.034
TERMS OF BEING GENTLEMEN,
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE BOTH OF US ARE

36:45.068 --> 36:46.275
COMPETITORS.

36:46.310 --> 36:49.206
BOTH OF US DON'T HAVE TO MAKE
UNDERHAND MOVES BECAUSE WE CAN

36:49.241 --> 36:50.482
COMPETE.

36:50.517 --> 36:52.206
OF COURSE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IN
THIS GAME, BUT FOR ME, IT WAS

36:52.241 --> 36:55.793
JUST, LIKE, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
WANT TO COME IN AND PLAY KIND

36:55.827 --> 36:59.724
OF-- I WANTED TO SEE IF--
ESPECIALLY REPRESENTATION-WISE.

36:59.758 --> 37:02.517
BEING THE FIRST BLACK WINNER I
WANT THEM TO WIN WITH SOME SORT

37:02.551 --> 37:05.413
OF HONOR INSTEAD OF WIN BY ANY
MEANS NECESSARY.

37:05.448 --> 37:07.241
Julie: YOU SAVED XAVIER
LAST WEEK.

37:07.275 --> 37:08.413
THREE TIMES.

37:08.448 --> 37:10.310
Julie: WITH THE POWER OF
VETO AND HE DID NOT SAVE YOU

37:10.344 --> 37:10.620
TONIGHT.

37:10.655 --> 37:11.724
YEAH.

37:11.758 --> 37:13.896
Julie: WERE YOU SURPRISED
THAT HE DID NOT SAVE YOU

37:13.931 --> 37:15.206
TONIGHT.

37:15.241 --> 37:16.620
AS SOON AS HE DIDN'T USE THE
VETO I KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

37:16.655 --> 37:20.206
I WAS LIKE, OKAY, THERE WOULDN'T
BE ANY OTHER REASON FOR HIM NOT

37:20.241 --> 37:21.034
TO.

37:21.068 --> 37:22.896
I UNDERSTAND FROM A STRATEGY
MINDSET.

37:22.931 --> 37:25.655
LIKE I SAID, I THINK IT WAS MORE
JUST THINKING IN TERMS OF

37:25.689 --> 37:28.724
GENTLEMEN, IN TERMS OF A
COMPETITOR, IN TERMS OF NOT JUST

37:28.758 --> 37:31.344
WINNING BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY,
BUT WINNING WITH SOME SORT OF,

37:31.379 --> 37:34.551
LIKE, HONOR AND BRAVERY, AND NOT
LIKE A COWARDLY WAY.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.379
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I WAS
TALKING ABOUT AT THE END THERE.

37:36.413 --> 37:39.034
Julie: DIDN'T YOU THINK,
OKAY, HE DIDN'T SAVE ME, BUT I'M

37:39.068 --> 37:41.655
GOING TO GET SAVED BY BIG "D'S"
VOTE?

37:41.689 --> 37:43.448
NO, I THOUGHT IT WAS
POSSIBLE.

37:43.482 --> 37:46.344
BUT FOR ME, GIVEN ALL THE
CONVERSATIONS, THEY WOULDN'T

37:46.379 --> 37:47.620
LINE UP.

37:47.655 --> 37:48.931
AS SOON AS IT MADE CLEAR HE WAS
LYING ABOUT USING THE VETO, IT

37:48.965 --> 37:52.758
WAS LIKE, OKAY, HE'S NOT GOING
TO DO THAT WITHOUT-- AND RISK

37:52.793 --> 37:55.896
ANY OTHER REPERCUSSIONS, UNLESS
IT'S ALREADY BEEN COORDINATED.

37:55.931 --> 37:59.034
Julie: HOW ABOUT WE WATCH
YOUR GOOD-BYE MESSAGES?

37:59.068 --> 37:59.862
THAT... WORKS.

37:59.896 --> 38:00.379
Julie: RIGHT HERE.

38:00.413 --> 38:01.517
THANK YOU.

38:01.551 --> 38:05.034
KYLAND, YOU HAVE BEEN AN
INCREDIBLE COMPETITOR THIS

38:05.068 --> 38:07.655
ENTIRE GAME, AND SUCH A GREAT
ASSET TO THE COOKOUT.

38:07.689 --> 38:08.862
I DO LOVE YOU.

38:08.896 --> 38:11.862
AND I DO HOPE THAT WE CAN
CONTINUE TO BE FRIENDS OUTSIDE

38:11.896 --> 38:12.482
OF THIS HOUSE.

38:12.517 --> 38:14.758
KYLAND, I AM SO SORRY.

38:14.793 --> 38:18.517
I KNOW WE MADE A DEAL, BUT I
HAVE TO BREAK THAT BECAUSE WHEN

38:18.551 --> 38:21.172
I ASKED YOU ABOUT THE FINAL TWO,
YOU STUTTERED.

38:21.206 --> 38:23.379
DOES THAT MAKE ME FEEL SAFE?

38:23.413 --> 38:23.827
NO.

38:23.862 --> 38:25.034
BUT I LOVE YOU.

38:25.068 --> 38:28.000
I HOPE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE
BEING FRIENDS OUTSIDE OF THIS

38:28.034 --> 38:29.310
HOUSE.

38:29.344 --> 38:31.586
KYLAND, YOU ALWAYS SAID TO BE
THE BEST PLAYER YOU HAVE TO BEAT

38:31.620 --> 38:32.620
THE BEST.

38:32.655 --> 38:36.034
WHICH IS WHY I CONVINCED BIG "D"
TO VOTE YOU OUT.

38:36.068 --> 38:37.931
I'VE HAD DEALS THROUGHOUT THE
COOKOUT.

38:37.965 --> 38:42.517
HOWEVER, THE DEAL I PRIORITIZED
OVER ALL OTHERS WAS THE FINAL

38:42.551 --> 38:46.034
TWO DEAL I HAD WITH BIG "D"
PERFORM I HOPE YOU RESPECT SOME

38:46.068 --> 38:48.586
DECISION FROM A GAME
PERSPECTIVE.

38:48.620 --> 38:51.586
I TRULY BELIEVE YOU ARE ONE OF
THE OF BEST PLAYERS OF SEASON.

38:51.620 --> 38:55.000
WE ARE LIKE BROTHERS AND WE WILL
